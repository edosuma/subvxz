05:42.570 --> 05:45.840
- yoga,where have you been?
- i went for a walk on the beach.

05:45.840 --> 05:47.020

05:56.220 --> 05:58.550
mitsy sacks will be back
from barcelona in the fall,

05:58.550 --> 05:59.830
and i don't think she'll take too kindly

05:59.830 --> 06:03.470
- to having escaped convicts hiding out in her home.
-  just as long as we still hanging

06:03.470 --> 06:05.540
for candy bergen's
end-of-the-summer barbecue

06:05.540 --> 06:07.440
'cause everybody was talking about that

06:07.440 --> 06:11.720
- at the clambake last night.
- we are fugitives. you're going to get us caught.

06:11.720 --> 06:13.850

06:13.850 --> 06:15.690

i want to see my children.

06:36.610 --> 06:38.710
i want my husband back,

06:39.670 --> 06:42.170
but that damn bitch won't
let him out her sight.

06:42.170 --> 06:43.650
she's moved into my house,

06:43.650 --> 06:45.340

06:47.570 --> 06:50.180
you front page still,baby.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.360

06:53.360 --> 06:56.230
mitsy throws a big
halloween party every year.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.080
she has a closet full
of costumes upstairs.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.700
you got a date on that party?

07:00.700 --> 07:03.150
'cause i already got
uma's hayride that week.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.540
oh,my god. mmm.

07:11.540 --> 07:14.810
guessed who just showered
a mere 7 inches away

07:14.810 --> 07:17.630
from mr. emilio estevez
at the gym this morning.

07:17.630 --> 07:21.620
i am telling you-steam,a
little soap in your eyes...

07:21.910 --> 07:23.880
st. elmo's still on fire.

07:23.880 --> 07:26.760
mmm. what is that on
the corner of your mouth?

07:27.320 --> 07:28.240
lip liner.

07:28.240 --> 07:30.680
don't you lie to me,missy.

07:32.170 --> 07:34.220
you've taken a lover,

07:34.220 --> 07:37.760
and that lover has a creamy center.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.920
just leave me alone.

07:40.920 --> 07:43.490
mandy... you're binging...

07:43.490 --> 07:45.790
and gaining weight by the minute.

07:46.540 --> 07:47.720
stop staring at me!

07:47.720 --> 07:49.990
i didn't stop when emilio
asked,and i won't stop now.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.900
listen to me. i know you're stressed

07:51.900 --> 07:53.570
about this whole birth
certificate thing. shh!

07:53.570 --> 07:56.810
but you're starting to look
like two fat girls hugging.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.460
just bite the bullet and
confront your parents.

07:59.460 --> 08:01.000
what if it's true?

08:01.000 --> 08:03.470
what if fey sommers is really my mother?

08:03.470 --> 08:05.060
but at least you'll know the truth

08:05.060 --> 08:06.850
and let the healing begin,

08:06.850 --> 08:09.850
and by "healing," i
mean a 3-day f flush.

08:09.850 --> 08:11.830
i haven'gained that much.

08:11.830 --> 08:15.300
you can't even notice.
"mode" magazine,please hold.

08:15.300 --> 08:17.180
morning,mark,betty.

08:18.850 --> 08:21.250
i'm calling them. i'm calling them!

08:21.250 --> 08:22.440
ew.

08:33.090 --> 08:36.120
- good morning. - oh,betty,i'm so glad
you're here. big toe-please scratch.

08:36.120 --> 08:37.400
okay.

08:37.400 --> 08:40.039
oh,yeah,that's it.
oh,i'll never forget this.

08:40.039 --> 08:42.130
this is not what i want
to be remembered for.

08:42.130 --> 08:44.039
so when are they coming to
unhook you from this thing?

08:44.039 --> 08:47.840
- actually,i don't think i'll be getting out
of here today. - what? but the doctor said-

08:47.840 --> 08:48.890
you want to listen the doctor

08:48.890 --> 08:51.690
or the guy who smashed into
a tree going 80 miles an hour?

08:51.690 --> 08:54.590
- i am still in a lot of pain here,betty.
- well,i can see that.

08:54.590 --> 08:57.790
you've taken the pain pill
every time they've offered it.

08:57.790 --> 08:59.840
you know,daniel,you may
just want to pass on the pill

08:59.840 --> 09:04.590
- and see how you're feeling. - yeah,that
whole feeling part-not really interested.

09:04.590 --> 09:07.540
all right,i get it. so how's alexis?

09:08.040 --> 09:09.630
there's no change.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.690
mm. i was in with her all morning.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.280
you know,i've been doing
a lot of internet research,

09:16.280 --> 09:20.300
- and they say you really should talk to coma victims.
-  betty,i'm doing everything i can.

09:21.470 --> 09:23.560
i know. i'm sorry.

09:25.460 --> 09:26.680
????

09:26.680 --> 09:27.580
you know wilhelmina-

09:27.580 --> 09:30.020
jumping in with both
claws,running with it.

09:30.020 --> 09:33.070
oh,that reminds me. here are my notes

09:33.070 --> 09:35.010
on the features and the tahiti shoot.

09:35.010 --> 09:37.600
make sure wilhelmina incorporates them.

09:38.470 --> 09:40.960
????

09:40.960 --> 09:42.520
after all,everything i do here

09:42.520 --> 09:44.540
is in service of daniel's vision.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.240
well,thank you very much,wilhelmina.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.870
i will tell him you said that.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.890
all right,sheila. the
victoria's secret shoot-

09:53.890 --> 09:56.670
we have two double-page
spreads in november. go.

09:56.670 --> 09:59.910
okay. the concept is "what is sexy?"

09:59.910 --> 10:01.800
adriana and alessandra are booked,

10:01.800 --> 10:05.330
and we've put a pin in
st. barths or coney island,

10:05.330 --> 10:06.420
depending on the budget.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.690
and who's shooting? peter?

10:07.690 --> 10:11.100
i slept with peter. trust
me,he doesn't know what sexy is.

10:11.100 --> 10:12.720
i was thinking warren.

10:12.720 --> 10:15.060
he made kate moss look
like a man. get owen.

10:15.060 --> 10:18.230
done. by the way...

10:18.230 --> 10:22.500
i'm wearing the "very sexy"
push-up bra they sent over.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.440
i've never felt hotter.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.770
save the ass kissing
for the clients,sheila.

10:27.770 --> 10:29.630
all right,features.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.580
i'm moving the london
designers to the front.

10:32.580 --> 10:35.750
tell health and fitness they
get six pages instead of eight,

10:35.750 --> 10:38.090
and i'm still not happy
with european getaways.

10:38.090 --> 10:41.780
congratulations,phillip. you've
managed to make paris boring.

10:41.780 --> 10:43.550

10:57.700 --> 10:59.630
mm. and for what?

10:59.630 --> 11:01.740
this magazine will never be mine.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.660
claire owns "mode," and
she'll never give it up.

11:04.660 --> 11:06.250
who cares? in a few weeks,

11:06.250 --> 11:07.750
you'll be marrying old man liver spots

11:07.750 --> 11:08.950
and all the rest of meade publications

11:08.950 --> 11:12.780
will be yours. mm. if she
doesn't screw that up for me,too.

11:12.780 --> 11:14.690
she's out there somewhere.

11:14.690 --> 11:15.580
i just have to make sure

11:15.580 --> 11:17.610
she does not make any
contact with bradford

11:17.610 --> 11:19.990
before i get that ring on my finger. mm.

11:20.310 --> 11:24.140
where are you,you gin-soaked hag?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.320

11:28.450 --> 11:30.870
okay,the victoria's
secret stuff's good to go.

11:30.870 --> 11:32.970
ooh. ooh. the leopard print baby doll.

11:33.970 --> 11:36.050
<i>hello,mrs. matt damon.</i>

11:36.050 --> 11:37.990
are you doing that "mrs.
matt damon" thing again?

11:37.990 --> 11:40.910
i'd like to give him a "bourne ultimatum."
listen,do you have the test shots

11:40.910 --> 11:42.410
for the natural disasters
makeover shoot today?

11:42.410 --> 11:43.440
i want to show 'em to daniel.

11:43.440 --> 11:47.810
right here. oh,amazing. tse
women have lost everything.

11:47.810 --> 11:50.090
wilhelmina thinks a
mani-pedi and a new weave

11:50.090 --> 11:52.440
is gonna change their lives. oh,and
who said fashion doesn't care?

11:52.760 --> 11:56.980
still on for lunch? that was lunch. i
have to go. gotta meet my dad's lawyer.

11:56.980 --> 11:58.310
gotta do some grocery shopping.

11:58.310 --> 12:00.080
gotta get a sandwich to
the hospital for daniel

12:00.080 --> 12:01.780
because they're serving
fish,and he hates it.

12:01.780 --> 12:05.210
then i gotta be back here for the photo shoot
at 3:00. betty,you can't keep going at this pace.

12:05.210 --> 12:06.970
i'm fine. no,you're not,look at you.

12:06.970 --> 12:09.750
you're rushing around after
everybody else. what about you?

12:09.750 --> 12:13.780
have you even called henry? it's
been three weeks. oh,christina,please.

12:13.780 --> 12:16.080
look,i don't have time
to think about henry,

12:16.080 --> 12:18.490
not with santos and daniel and alexis

12:18.490 --> 12:20.560
and-and my dad still stuck in mexico.

12:20.560 --> 12:23.220
i don't have time to worry
about little boyfriend problems,

12:23.220 --> 12:25.710
which isn't even a problem
because he's not here.

12:25.710 --> 12:28.320
he's in tucson with
his pregnant girlfriend.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.560
end of story. but m-maybe
the baby's not his.

12:30.560 --> 12:31.620
and maybe it is,

12:31.620 --> 12:33.880
and the best thing that i
can do to take care of myself

12:33.880 --> 12:36.680
is to not think about him at
all. betty,i just don't want you-

12:36.680 --> 12:40.560
christina,enough! i cannot let
myself be distracted by henry.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.290
i need to look straight ahead. (thu

12:44.350 --> 12:45.920
oh,betty.

13:19.630 --> 13:21.660
so this is where you grew up?

13:22.020 --> 13:25.100
this is it
- the house of lies.

13:25.100 --> 13:26.640
mother!

13:26.640 --> 13:29.490
<i>if that is her real name.</i>

13:31.890 --> 13:33.150
amanda?

13:33.150 --> 13:37.060
wh-what are you doing out here
in the middle of the afternoon?

13:37.060 --> 13:38.700
and overweight?

13:38.700 --> 13:40.820
who's overweight? amanda!

13:41.090 --> 13:43.320
hi,kitten. you didn't call.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.730
what are you doing here?

13:45.730 --> 13:48.120
i waed to talk to you both now,

13:48.120 --> 13:50.090
while i've got my nerve.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.220
i don't think you two have
been very honest with me.

13:54.220 --> 13:56.570
what are you talking about?
we tell you everything.

13:56.910 --> 13:59.490
actually,i think there's
one very big secret

13:59.490 --> 14:00.710
you haven't told me about.

14:00.710 --> 14:03.930
what secrets? we don't have
any secrets in this house. no.

14:03.930 --> 14:06.620
yoo-hoo! did someone forget about us?

14:06.980 --> 14:08.790
we were getting lonely.

14:13.130 --> 14:15.550
uh,this is our
daughter a-a-amanda

14:15.550 --> 14:16.920
and her friend marc,

14:16.920 --> 14:20.410
and this is,um,bob and elaine klein.

14:20.410 --> 14:23.040
they're our new,uh,internet friends.

14:24.270 --> 14:27.010
it's a very funny story.
see,they came over to play tennis.

14:27.010 --> 14:29.540
and wouldn't you know
it,the sprinklers went off?

14:29.540 --> 14:31.110
that's right. that's right. it was...

14:32.490 --> 14:34.430
they're just waiting
for their clothes to dry.

14:34.430 --> 14:35.030
you know what?

14:35.030 --> 14:37.560
we're,uh,we're gonna go wait.

14:37.950 --> 14:39.910
for our clothes to dry.

14:43.190 --> 14:44.930
now what's all this
crazy talk about secrets?

14:48.750 --> 14:50.860
you know what? i
- i can't do this. never mind.

14:50.860 --> 14:51.850
- amanda.
- i can't.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.310
- you have to.
- i can't!

14:53.310 --> 14:54.500
amanda found a birth certificate

14:54.500 --> 14:57.340
that said that fey sommers
was her real mother.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.440
ugh. this is taking forever.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.300
i just have so much to do
today. you don't understand.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.820
daniel cannot eat hospital fish.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.340
okay,ms. suarez.

15:10.680 --> 15:12.410
uh,it doesn't appear
to be a concussion...

15:12.410 --> 15:13.200
see?

15:13.200 --> 15:15.790
but i am a tad concerned

15:15.790 --> 15:17.450
about your heart rate
and blood pressure.

15:17.450 --> 15:20.390
really? he said a "tad."
a tad isn't serious,right?

15:20.390 --> 15:22.230
could be nothing,could
be stress related.

15:22.230 --> 15:23.990
now are you under lot of
pressure right now? yes.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.140
<i>no. no.</i>

15:26.210 --> 15:28.080
well,you might want to think
about slowing down a bit.

15:28.080 --> 15:30.190
now leave that patch on
until the swelling's gone,

15:30.190 --> 15:34.140
and i'll be back in a minute with a
prescription. okay. thank you very much,doctor.

15:34.140 --> 15:35.840
well,i hope you take
his warning seriously

15:35.840 --> 15:39.380
and maybe start to slow down just a little bit
- oh,no! it's 12:00! i'm late for my dad's lawyer.

15:39.380 --> 15:40.940
will you stay for the prescription?

15:40.940 --> 15:41.980
please,please,please,please,please.

15:41.980 --> 15:44.080
and tell them i'll be there
on time for the photo shoot.

15:44.080 --> 15:45.350
excuse me!

15:46.490 --> 15:48.320
we're so sorry we never told you,honey.

15:48.320 --> 15:50.510
fey never wanted you to know.

15:50.510 --> 15:52.440
i can't believe this.

15:52.440 --> 15:54.170
i'm adopted.

15:55.890 --> 15:56.590
how?

15:56.590 --> 15:58.560
well,when your father
worked for fey,you know,

15:58.560 --> 16:01.770
handling her accounts,she
found out she was pregnant.

16:01.770 --> 16:03.420
she wouldn't even tell
us who the father was.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.100
honey,all fey ever wanted was a career.

16:05.100 --> 16:07.940
she knew she could never
give you the love you needed.

16:07.940 --> 16:11.820
and since we couldn't have kids on our
own... your father has lethargic sperm.

16:12.240 --> 16:14.870
is that really an important
part of the story,rosemary?

16:14.870 --> 16:17.060
so you've been lying
to me all these years?

16:17.420 --> 16:20.240
i'm not here. just
looking for some more wine.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.010
amanda,adopted or not,

16:22.010 --> 16:25.930
- weoved you from the moment we held you in our arms.
-  you're still our little girl.

16:25.930 --> 16:30.130
no,i'm not! i'm fey's and
some guy we don't even know.

16:30.130 --> 16:33.160
i don't think i'll ever be able
to trust you two ever again!

16:38.100 --> 16:39.970
it was really nice seeing you again.

16:39.970 --> 16:41.760
your home is beautiful.

17:05.400 --> 17:06.650
hey.

17:08.140 --> 17:10.829
hey! you leave my sister alone.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.240
you want a photo of a meade in trouble?

17:12.240 --> 17:14.440
here i am,you son of a bitch!

17:15.900 --> 17:18.609
mr. meade,this is i.c.u.

17:23.270 --> 17:24.780
any change at all today?

17:24.780 --> 17:26.460
her vitals are the same.

17:28.840 --> 17:31.150
mr. meade,are you sure you
don't want to go in and see her?

17:31.540 --> 17:33.300
it just seems like you want to.

17:33.760 --> 17:34.810
you come this far every day,

17:34.810 --> 17:36.840
and you look at her through the window.

17:37.720 --> 17:42.930
i can't. no,i think,um,i
need my medication.

17:42.930 --> 17:44.680
it's been four hours.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.920
you know,you go through life
thinking you're one person,

17:51.920 --> 17:56.290
and then boom,just like
that,the slate is wiped clean.

17:56.290 --> 17:57.460
i mean,who am i?

17:57.460 --> 18:00.640
- you are fey sommers' daughter.
- yeah,but what does that even mean?

18:00.640 --> 18:03.070
she's just a woman who
walked by my desk for years,

18:03.070 --> 18:05.510
and she never even looked
at me,and now she's gone.

18:05.510 --> 18:08.200
maybe if we can find out
who your real father is...

18:08.200 --> 18:10.870
how? he could be anybody.

18:11.210 --> 18:14.800
true. your mother was
a hoochie in a bob.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.050
mm.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.480
if bradford is my father,

18:48.480 --> 18:50.760
that makes daniel my brother...

18:50.760 --> 18:53.250
who i slept with... a lot,

18:53.850 --> 18:55.600
and that's the kind of
dirty that don't wash clean.

18:55.600 --> 18:59.010
<i>okay,first of all,he'd
be your half brother.</i>

18:59.010 --> 19:00.440
already a little better,right?

19:00.440 --> 19:03.220
and second,i gotta say,kinda hot.

19:03.690 --> 19:05.290
it's incest.

19:05.290 --> 19:07.570
okay,before you get all
"flowers in the attic" on me,

19:07.570 --> 19:11.600
let's first find out if
bradford really is your dad.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.840
and how are we gonna do that?

19:12.840 --> 19:14.270
invite him to father's day brunch

19:14.270 --> 19:15.270
and see if he shows up?

19:15.270 --> 19:20.100
no,sarcasma. three words-d.n.a.

19:21.830 --> 19:23.550
dad,i'm so sorry.

19:23.550 --> 19:25.690
i was only ten minutes
late to the lawyer's office,

19:25.690 --> 19:28.790
but he still wouldn't see me.
so i made another appointment.

19:28.790 --> 19:31.760
<i>mija,relax. i'm fine here.</i>

19:32.410 --> 19:33.870
although it wouldn't
kill your cheap aunt

19:33.870 --> 19:37.390
to turn on the air conditioning every
now and then! well,are you eating enough?

19:37.390 --> 19:39.510
are you taking your medication? oh!

19:39.510 --> 19:42.020
oh,i'm sorry. no peripheral vision.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.160
stop worrying about me.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.550
it just kills me that i'm so far away.

19:47.550 --> 19:48.660
i know.

19:48.660 --> 19:52.170
but you'll be home
soon,so just have faith.

19:52.920 --> 19:54.320
<i>te quiero.</i>

19:54.740 --> 19:56.140
<i>te quiero.</i>

19:58.670 --> 20:01.010
<i>s? i mean,hello></i>

20:01.010 --> 20:02.990
is this betty suarez? yeah.

20:02.990 --> 20:05.870
this is lisa lapera,justin's
camp counselor.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.710
i just wanted to let you
know,your nephew just took off.

20:08.710 --> 20:10.110
what do you mean,he just took off?

20:10.110 --> 20:12.850
apparently,the indian dream
catchers we were making

20:12.850 --> 20:15.450
were "amateurish" and
"culturally insensitive."

20:15.450 --> 20:17.660
he threw a hissy fit and
said he was going home,

20:17.660 --> 20:20.770
and i'm not sure,but i think
he stole a bottle of glitter.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.180
and we need that back
or a check for $1.99.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.970
justin wouldn't...

20:27.970 --> 20:29.500
hello?

20:30.140 --> 20:31.360
ugh.

20:31.360 --> 20:33.180
this is not happening.

20:40.330 --> 20:41.140
<i>no!</i>

20:41.140 --> 20:42.980
damn,the hooker had her baby kidnapped,

20:42.980 --> 20:45.870
now she has tetanus?
that's a pretty bad monday.

20:45.870 --> 20:48.430
okay,december 15th is
the latest we can go

20:48.430 --> 20:49.510
with the new wedding date.

20:49.510 --> 20:50.920
otherwise people try to combine

20:50.920 --> 20:52.910
your wedding gift with
your christmas gift,

20:52.910 --> 20:55.220
and that is not gonna happen.

20:55.570 --> 20:57.580
you sure you wanna wait till december?

20:57.580 --> 20:59.370
i mean,didn't this teach us anything?

21:00.230 --> 21:02.870
gotta live for today.
what are you trying to say?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.320
let's elope.

21:05.320 --> 21:06.710
elope? yeah.

21:06.710 --> 21:09.110
oh. no,seriously,you,me,we'll
grab justin.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.190
we'll go down to city hall this weekend.

21:10.190 --> 21:12.690
besides,my dad would die if
he doesn't get to give me away.

21:13.450 --> 21:15.170
i guess it would be pretty rough...

21:15.910 --> 21:19.500
to miss you walking down the
aisle in your wedding dress.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.680
you think it's all right
that i'm wearing white,right?

21:21.680 --> 21:22.940
why don't you show me the dress?

21:22.940 --> 21:24.850
no way! that is bad luck!

21:24.850 --> 21:27.470
i just got shot. how much
worse can my luck get?

21:28.800 --> 21:30.280
come on,mama.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.160
oh... dad-ford!

21:47.140 --> 21:48.230
i mean,bradford.

21:48.240 --> 21:50.020
i mean,mr. meade!

21:50.030 --> 21:53.890
i sufferrom severe cotton mouth.

21:53.900 --> 21:56.900
would you mind licking this for me?

21:57.360 --> 21:58.400
i beg your pardon?

21:58.410 --> 22:00.910
lick this for me.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.820
amanda,you don't have
to lick these. see?

22:05.900 --> 22:07.760
thank you,betty. you're welcome.

22:09.030 --> 22:10.520
hey,what's different about you?

22:10.530 --> 22:11.960
did you ge your hair cut?

22:12.400 --> 22:14.030
i'm wearing an eye patch.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.780
you didn't always have that?

22:21.900 --> 22:23.550
those are pink gerber daisies.

22:23.560 --> 22:25.740
hey,look at that! they're for you.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.140
i think they came a few weeks ago.

22:27.150 --> 22:29.890
well,why didn't you give them
to me? you know what,betty?

22:29.900 --> 22:32.090
i have had a lot on my
mind these last few weeks.

22:32.100 --> 22:33.980
amanda! it might be hard to believe,

22:33.990 --> 22:36.660
but pretty girls have problems,too.

22:44.930 --> 22:46.790
thinking of you

23:05.330 --> 23:07.820
all right, ladies of natural disasters,

23:07.830 --> 23:10.330
and do say "ladies" and not "victims,"

23:10.340 --> 23:12.480
because there isn't a victim among you.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.880
you've all survived horrible tragedies

23:14.890 --> 23:18.100
and now "mode" is going
to make you beautiful.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.180
sheila,talk to me.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.760
okay,just like on
the storyboards--

23:22.770 --> 23:27.090
we're gonna show them
at their absolute worst--

23:27.100 --> 23:31.550
ravaged by hurricanes, floods,fires...

23:31.560 --> 23:32.550
sad,sad,sad.

23:32.560 --> 23:35.970
and then we do the "afters."
happy,sexy,blown out. i love it.

23:35.980 --> 23:39.010
we change their lives and,uh,
showcase the fall collections.

23:39.020 --> 23:41.440
mm-hmm. just make sure the
skinny ones are up front.

23:41.900 --> 23:43.920
(sheila) "famine," makeup. now.

23:45.010 --> 23:46.580
bless your heart.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.490
what disaster are you, honey? mudslide?

23:49.890 --> 23:51.060
what?

23:51.070 --> 23:53.470
no,i'm not a victim. i'm fine.

23:54.180 --> 23:56.790
i just need some food. my
blood sugar's a little low.

23:56.800 --> 23:59.280
uh-huh. looking good,"flood."

24:00.310 --> 24:01.840
excuse me, are there any more bagels?

24:01.850 --> 24:04.190
i don't see any more bagels. uh,no!

24:04.200 --> 24:05.640
you can have mine.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.900
no,no,no,no,no.

24:07.910 --> 24:11.320
i'm not gonna take a bagel from
"famine." you need to eat,too.

24:11.330 --> 24:13.860
give me sofi of th

24:13.870 --> 24:15.930
it's just that there is nobody here

24:15.940 --> 24:17.820
who cares about filling the inside.

24:17.830 --> 24:20.340
they only care about fixing the outside!

24:21.390 --> 24:23.030
what's stumpy up to now?

24:23.040 --> 24:24.310
you know what? this concealer here,

24:24.320 --> 24:27.730
this isn't gonna change the fact
that she doesn't have a house!

24:28.880 --> 24:30.490
and--and this,
this eyeliner,

24:30.500 --> 24:33.180
this isn't gonna bring back
the people that you loved!

24:33.820 --> 24:36.750
these women have lost everything!

24:37.030 --> 24:40.110
and there is not enough styling gel

24:40.120 --> 24:42.280
in here to change that!

24:54.450 --> 24:56.070
you know what? she's right.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.370
we don't have enough styling gel.

25:04.960 --> 25:07.330
oh,excuse me,mr. meade!

25:07.340 --> 25:09.580
hi,i have some mail here for you.

25:10.290 --> 25:10.900
ow!

25:10.910 --> 25:14.100
oh,my god,a paper cut!
here,let me swab you.

25:14.110 --> 25:15.360
no,thank you.

25:15.460 --> 25:17.670
- ????
- ????

25:19.690 --> 25:21.520
hit me again.

25:22.040 --> 25:23.760
you sure? it's your third one.

25:23.770 --> 25:27.250
i know my limit. this
time chili cheese fries.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.430
betty?

25:31.420 --> 25:32.940
daniel?

25:33.260 --> 25:34.580
why aren't you in the hospital?

25:34.590 --> 25:39.090
well,i had a few... dozen
calls about the photo shoot.

25:39.100 --> 25:41.290
i thought you might need a friend.

25:47.960 --> 25:49.260
fry?

25:50.260 --> 25:51.410
i was thinking with the leopard,

25:51.420 --> 25:53.170
we could add
this belt-- n!

25:53.180 --> 25:55.840
i don't have the energy
to say "no" anymore.

25:57.090 --> 25:57.940
what about this boa?

25:57.950 --> 25:59.190
n!

26:00.590 --> 26:02.120
what about this
brooch? we can--

26:02.130 --> 26:04.880
why don't you just
stick the pin in my eye?

26:05.280 --> 26:06.740
what is the matter with you people?

26:06.750 --> 26:08.860
we might as well be
publishing "field & stream"

26:08.870 --> 26:10.270
because apparently no one in this room

26:10.280 --> 26:11.970
knows a thing about fashion!

26:13.750 --> 26:15.520
(justin whispers) loose the belt.

26:28.540 --> 26:29.480
is it just me,

26:29.490 --> 26:32.570
or does anyone else see
the little fashion elf?

26:33.180 --> 26:36.500
i'm sorry. i just think it's too busy.

26:36.510 --> 26:38.950
like coco chanel always says,

26:39.290 --> 26:40.670
"when accessorizing"...

26:40.680 --> 26:42.060
"always take off..."
"always take off..."

26:42.070 --> 26:45.550
"the last thing you put on."
"the last thing you put on."

26:54.090 --> 26:55.490
you've got the gift.

26:55.890 --> 26:57.550
phone call!

26:58.010 --> 27:00.140
i'm in the middle of a
run-through. take a message.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.960
it's "schmaire schmeade."

27:02.540 --> 27:04.200
(lowers voice) claire
meade? (lowers voice) yes.

27:04.210 --> 27:05.290
(normal voice) everyone out!

27:05.300 --> 27:06.960
(normal voice) go,go. get.
get out of here. go. go. go.

27:06.970 --> 27:08.450
get out! ace the call.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.780
what? how? i don't know. figure it out.

27:10.790 --> 27:12.660
triangulate the signal.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.850
hello,is this no one's most wanted?

27:18.860 --> 27:20.700
oh,bite me,wilhelmina.

27:20.710 --> 27:22.210
i wanna talk to you about bradford.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.250
you mean my fianc?

27:24.260 --> 27:25.530
you're not in love with him.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.750
oh,claire, you're so wrong.

27:27.760 --> 27:30.470
i'm madly in love with
him. as a matter of fact,

27:30.480 --> 27:33.630
i'm staring at our wedding
invitations as we speak.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.410
do you love him more than "mode"?

27:35.940 --> 27:39.130
i know the magazine is what
you've wanted all along.

27:39.140 --> 27:41.350
and i'm the only person
who can give it to you.

27:41.360 --> 27:42.490
keep talking.

27:42.500 --> 27:45.640
leave bradford,and i will
sign "mode" over to you.

27:45.650 --> 27:48.640
"wilhelmina slater--
editor-in-chief."

27:48.990 --> 27:50.510
are you salivating yet?

27:50.520 --> 27:51.570
no.

27:51.580 --> 27:54.630
meet me at the bow bridge in
central park tonight at 8:00.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.930
i'll be dressed as a nun.

27:56.940 --> 27:59.400
or a cat. i haven't decided yet.

27:59.830 --> 28:00.850
have the documents ready,

28:00.860 --> 28:02.640
and i will sign "mode" over to you.

28:02.650 --> 28:04.250
8:00.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.060
i couldn't do it.

28:08.070 --> 28:09.180
i couldn't triangulate the signal.

28:09.190 --> 28:12.070
i don't even know what triangulate
means! don't worry,marc.

28:13.270 --> 28:17.390
i think all our problems
will be taken care of.

28:21.010 --> 28:22.420
how'd you find me?

28:23.560 --> 28:24.370
it's no secret

28:24.380 --> 28:26.360
you turn to potatoes in times of need.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.550
it helps.

28:30.450 --> 28:33.020
look,daniel, i'm really sorry

28:33.030 --> 28:34.900
if i screwed up the photo shoot.

28:34.910 --> 28:36.910
i just--i think this
whole thing with henry--

28:36.920 --> 28:38.920
it finally got to me.

28:38.930 --> 28:40.820
and i shouldn't have let it.

28:40.830 --> 28:42.790
after everything that's
happened to my family

28:42.800 --> 28:44.830
and to you...

28:45.320 --> 28:47.490
he's just a guy,right?

28:48.640 --> 28:49.990
he's a guy you loved.

28:53.280 --> 28:55.600
you know what? i have an idea.

28:56.370 --> 28:57.870
go back the office.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.050
there are some things you're
gonna need to get for tonight.

29:02.010 --> 29:03.400
what's tonight?

29:03.870 --> 29:05.440
we're going to a funeral.

29:16.420 --> 29:17.860
sir?

29:19.910 --> 29:21.260
i don't mean to disturb you.

29:21.270 --> 29:23.290
may i speak to you privately?

29:23.670 --> 29:24.800
it's about wilhelmina. what about her?

29:24.810 --> 29:27.950
as you know,i'm privy to
many of her conversations,

29:27.960 --> 29:31.460
both professional... and personal.

29:32.220 --> 29:34.010
she has issues with you.

29:34.020 --> 29:34.750
issues?

29:34.760 --> 29:36.630
ear hair.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.040
i didn't realize i had any.

29:39.050 --> 29:40.450
perhaps others have tried to tell you,

29:40.460 --> 29:43.340
<i>but you couldn't hear
through all the ear hair.</i>

29:43.350 --> 29:45.130
she would never, in a million years,

29:45.140 --> 29:45.890
bring this up.

29:45.900 --> 29:49.490
so i thought,as someone
rooting for the relationship,

29:49.500 --> 29:51.400
i might spare you
both the embarrassment.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.040
may i clip you,sir?

30:00.040 --> 30:02.550
never send a girl to do a woman's job.

30:13.130 --> 30:15.710
mm.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.770
ah.

30:16.780 --> 30:19.220
don't you think this
is a little weird...

30:19.230 --> 30:21.010
and illegal?

30:21.530 --> 30:23.150
yeah, it's both those things.

30:23.160 --> 30:26.470
it's also symbolic. henry's gone.

30:26.480 --> 30:27.560
if you're gonna move on,

30:27.570 --> 30:28.940
you have to put him to rest, right?

30:28.950 --> 30:30.830
okay, i just hit something soft!

30:30.840 --> 30:32.450
ah! oh,i'm sorry.

30:32.460 --> 30:34.550
are you okay?  all
right, what are you gonna bury first?

30:34.560 --> 30:36.670
um,well...

30:37.890 --> 30:39.580
i could start with these.

30:41.850 --> 30:43.840
this is from our first meal together.

30:43.850 --> 30:45.450
sushi.

30:45.460 --> 30:48.440
it was good... getting to know him.

30:48.450 --> 30:50.510
the raw eel? not so much.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.300
low sodium.

30:53.310 --> 30:55.110
he was always looking out for me.

30:58.370 --> 31:00.190
man,you brought a lot of stuff.

31:00.970 --> 31:02.730
uh,we may need a bigger hole.

31:12.490 --> 31:14.350
yo,how you doing in there?

31:14.360 --> 31:16.720
okay,you ready?

31:20.300 --> 31:21.440
damn.

31:21.450 --> 31:24.270
you like it? i was
gonna take it in a bit,

31:24.280 --> 31:25.740
maybe cut the top a little bit lower.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.730
no,no,no,don't do anything.
don't touch it. it's beautiful.

31:28.740 --> 31:30.330
just like you.

31:30.950 --> 31:33.700
okay,so now you've seen the dress.

31:34.510 --> 31:38.310
<i>papi... i want something from you.</i>

31:38.320 --> 31:40.720
oh,come on,baby,you know
what the doctor said.

31:40.730 --> 31:42.350
i need at least a month.

31:43.300 --> 31:45.670
(laughs) no,not that.

31:45.680 --> 31:47.390
i wanna hear your vows.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.060
now?

31:51.190 --> 31:52.300
i knew it.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.350
i knew you didn't write them!

31:54.360 --> 31:56.120
you had two months!

31:56.130 --> 31:58.720
you are so not seeing
the honeymoon lingerieow.

32:01.130 --> 32:02.660
give me my jeans.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.540
reach into the back pocket. go ahead.

32:07.480 --> 32:08.970
you feel stupid?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.450
a little bit.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.100
mm-hmm.

32:27.870 --> 32:30.000
say your prayers,bitch.

32:32.720 --> 32:34.220
bradford!

32:34.690 --> 32:37.800
i knew i could count on you
working late on thursdays.

32:37.810 --> 32:41.320
we don't have much time.
wilhelmina is in the park.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.980
is she?

32:43.990 --> 32:48.000
you ain't wilhelmina slater. no,i'm
not even sure what i'm doing here

32:48.010 --> 32:49.950
or why i'm wearing this outfit.

32:50.410 --> 32:51.820
please don't hurt me. (pants)

32:53.170 --> 32:56.190
did you really think
i'd fall for your offer?

32:56.200 --> 33:00.140
i knew you'd never take "mode"
away from your own children.

33:00.150 --> 33:01.370
but that's all right.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.350
i may not have "mode,"

33:02.360 --> 33:04.440
but very soon i will
have everything else,

33:04.450 --> 33:07.140
including your husband.

33:07.740 --> 33:08.860
oh...

33:08.870 --> 33:11.120
listen to me go on and on.

33:11.530 --> 33:13.960
i'm so rude. sit down. you're the guest.

33:13.970 --> 33:16.330
let me,uh, fix you a drink.

33:17.110 --> 33:19.590
though you'll probably
have to down it quickly,

33:19.600 --> 33:25.460
because the police will be
here in,um... three minutes.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.290
i only need one.

33:37.280 --> 33:40.760
and this is the crown he
gave me at the middle ages.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.150
(snores) are you sleeping?

33:43.160 --> 33:44.100
no.

33:45.170 --> 33:47.040
(clears throat) that
was a silent prayer.

33:47.050 --> 33:48.440
i was just...

33:48.450 --> 33:51.990
so moved by the paper clips he gave you.

33:55.620 --> 33:57.730
this is good-bye for him and you.

33:57.740 --> 33:59.920
any final words?

34:03.340 --> 34:05.610
okay,well...

34:07.190 --> 34:09.480
here...

34:10.210 --> 34:12.889
near the place where
it all came to an end,

34:14.239 --> 34:16.710
lies the remnants of a relationship

34:16.719 --> 34:20.780
that almost, but never quite was.

34:21.440 --> 34:24.730
"it started good, really good.

34:26.520 --> 34:28.230
"and then it got bad...

34:28.900 --> 34:31.130
"mainly 'cause of me.

34:31.889 --> 34:33.800
"i took her for granted,

34:33.810 --> 34:36.449
"never realizing she
was everything i needed.

34:38.330 --> 34:40.010
"she was always there...

34:41.050 --> 34:42.889
right in front of me."

34:43.400 --> 34:45.250
i hoped for so much.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.230
i had a fantasy.

34:50.030 --> 34:52.179
we were together.

34:52.480 --> 34:54.409
we were building a life.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.260
"it took me ten years...

34:57.790 --> 35:00.270
"but i'm glad i finally
came to my senses...

35:02.820 --> 35:05.260
before the most special
thing in my life..."

35:05.270 --> 35:07.300
was gone...

35:07.800 --> 35:09.330
for good.

35:09.430 --> 35:12.840
* comfort is my solitude i embrace *

35:12.850 --> 35:14.810
i loved you,henry.

35:15.550 --> 35:16.890
"i love you,hilda."

35:20.130 --> 35:22.510
* i will rise from my sorrow

35:23.100 --> 35:25.530
* i wilmyrise froorrow *

35:25.540 --> 35:27.000
* i will rise from my sorrow

35:27.010 --> 35:29.340
how do you feel?

35:29.350 --> 35:31.910
i don't know. uh,better,i guess.

35:32.530 --> 35:34.460
maybe now i can start fresh.

35:38.250 --> 35:39.900
what's that? are you in pain?

35:40.510 --> 35:42.510
no,i
just--i...

35:44.350 --> 35:46.690
i need a fresh start,too.

35:47.380 --> 35:48.980
you okay?

35:48.990 --> 35:50.810
not really.

35:53.380 --> 35:55.410
there's something i didn't tell you.

35:55.420 --> 35:57.740
the reason we were in the accident...

35:57.750 --> 35:59.580
why my sister is in the coma...

36:02.270 --> 36:03.960
i was high.

36:05.880 --> 36:08.290
she was rushing me
to the rehab hospital.

36:09.940 --> 36:11.520
it was my fault.

36:12.930 --> 36:14.440
you know,i don't know if i'm ever...

36:14.450 --> 36:17.290
gonna be able to get over the guilt.

36:19.020 --> 36:20.590
but i can get over these.

36:35.540 --> 36:37.180
good-bye,henry.

36:39.150 --> 36:40.940
oh,it was horrible!
the next thing i know,

36:40.950 --> 36:42.640
sister mary gang member
threw me to the ground

36:42.650 --> 36:46.310
and took my wallet. marc,i
am in serious trouble.

36:46.320 --> 36:48.180
you? i don't think i'll
ever be able to watch

36:48.190 --> 36:50.510
"the sound of music" again!

36:51.200 --> 36:53.200
claire's not going away easily.

36:53.850 --> 36:55.840
and apparently she's got friends.

36:58.390 --> 37:00.240
i need protection.

37:23.690 --> 37:24.500
hi.

37:25.810 --> 37:26.990
it's me...

37:27.000 --> 37:28.600
daniel.

37:31.590 --> 37:35.150
sorry i didn't come by... sooner.

37:35.160 --> 37:38.520
i just didn't think i could
handle seeing you like this.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.670
you were always the rock, right?

37:50.120 --> 37:51.780
the strong one.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.990
oh,my god!

37:55.000 --> 37:57.450
i'm so sorry,alexis.

37:57.460 --> 37:59.780
this should be me.

38:04.690 --> 38:07.010
(strained voice) oh,i'm thirsty.

38:09.570 --> 38:11.230
nurse! nurse!

38:11.240 --> 38:13.270
alexis,can you hear me?

38:13.280 --> 38:15.560

38:17.350 --> 38:18.400
alexis,i...

38:18.410 --> 38:20.100
i can't believe this.

38:20.110 --> 38:22.780

38:23.270 --> 38:24.930

38:26.600 --> 38:28.200

38:28.830 --> 38:30.970

38:36.250 --> 38:36.900
hi.

38:36.910 --> 38:38.390

38:38.830 --> 38:40.900

a little fashion elf

38:40.910 --> 38:43.760
spreading the word of coco
chanel around "mode" today.

38:44.420 --> 38:46.870
i'm sorry,aunt betty. i had to get away.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.320
that's okay.

38:48.330 --> 38:49.790
but as far as
tomorrow goes--

38:49.800 --> 38:52.070
i know,back to camp.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.140

meant for greater things

38:54.150 --> 38:58.180
than macaroni necklaces,justin,
so i talked to daniel,

38:58.640 --> 39:01.380

need an intern around the office

39:01.390 --> 39:03.440
for the next couple of
weeks before school starts.

39:03.900 --> 39:06.550

39:19.920 --> 39:21.680
in front of everybody and just wing it?

39:23.470 --> 39:25.340
