Ah-h! There's
my big bro!

- Philip!
- Oh!

18:26.694 --> 18:27.826
Hi!

18:28.056 --> 18:30.883
Oh my God, you are way
prettier than Diane described!

18:30.909 --> 18:33.970
- You must be Becky.
- You are so handsome, brother...

18:35.348 --> 18:38.374
- Lovely to see you again, Elena.
- I'm so glad you could make it.

18:38.375 --> 18:42.310
Oh, um, I've... been going
to Philip's things since he was born.

18:42.313 --> 18:44.079
Haven't missed one yet.

- Sure.

18:50.486 --> 18:53.735
Baby sis, kudos
on beating me to the altar.

18:54.444 --> 18:57.032
I have one bit of
advice for you - elope...

18:57.514 --> 18:59.795
Mother's voice: <i>I'm allowed to
be picky about my son's choices.</i>

Clearly he's a grown man.</i>

<i>He's also my only son.
And he met her on a blind date.</i>

19:06.845 --> 19:08.710
<i>Yeah, set up by me...</i>

19:08.837 --> 19:10.203
Philip:
But you're all right?

19:10.205 --> 19:12.306
I'm good. Honestly,
everything's fine,

19:12.308 --> 19:14.441
it's just... a lot to do
in the next two weeks.

19:14.443 --> 19:16.229
If you need any help,
just let me know.

19:16.255 --> 19:18.912
Oh, God, no! Mother won't let
anyone come near the preparations.

19:18.914 --> 19:21.148
The only thing you need to worry
about is finding a dress.

19:21.150 --> 19:23.514
Oh, I thought I'd
just wear this dress.

19:23.515 --> 19:24.948
W...

19:25.154 --> 19:26.753
Of course, what
was I thinking?

19:26.755 --> 19:29.322
I should find something special
for the special occasion.

19:29.324 --> 19:31.892
I will sort you out
tomorrow, right?

19:31.894 --> 19:35.162
To all the ladies in my

19:35.164 --> 19:38.298

(Insects chirping)

19:50.711 --> 19:53.307
- We came as fast as we could.
- Antonio.

19:56.098 --> 19:57.331
- Hmm?
- Nick...

19:57.332 --> 19:59.207
Mm, hey, buddy.

19:59.753 --> 20:01.120
Thought you
were in Italy.

20:01.122 --> 20:04.356
Well, moving the Italian Pack's assets
through Geneva only took a day,

20:04.358 --> 20:06.725
so I spent the rest of the
time on the Amalfi coast.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.394
- Nick grabbed me from JFK.
- Yeah, jet-set over here.

20:09.396 --> 20:11.530
- Where's Jeremy?
- He's downstairs.

20:17.537 --> 20:19.003
(Sniffing)

20:29.281 --> 20:31.349
- Jeremy: Hello, old friend.
- Hey.

20:33.452 --> 20:35.920
- You look good.
- Nick...

20:37.990 --> 20:40.325
- Glad you're here.
- Good to see you.

20:40.326 --> 20:42.026
So what
do you know?

20:42.162 --> 20:43.995
It looked like
a wolf kill,

20:43.997 --> 20:47.378
and the coroner will determine
that soon enough, but...

20:47.518 --> 20:49.633
I could smell it was
not merely a wolf.

20:49.635 --> 20:53.671
We haven't had any problem
with Mutts in our territory for years.

20:53.673 --> 20:56.607
- Who's top of the shit list?
- You see, that's the thing.

20:56.609 --> 20:58.696
I've never smelt him before,
I have no idea who he is.

20:58.697 --> 21:02.173
Some random Mutt comes and
kills in our territory. Why?

21:02.719 --> 21:05.585
The most important thing
is the kill itself.

21:05.650 --> 21:08.919
Whoever this is, they broke a cardinal
rule by killing a human for sport.

21:08.921 --> 21:10.854
They have to
pay for that.

21:10.856 --> 21:14.317
- So what's the plan?
- I've called everyone home.

21:14.593 --> 21:17.625
- We'll deal with this as a Pack.
- All of us?

21:17.930 --> 21:19.496
Everyone
comes home.

21:19.498 --> 21:21.964
- Peter, Logan...
- Elena?

21:23.501 --> 21:25.334
Jeremy:
Yes, Elena.

21:25.336 --> 21:27.270
It's been years
since she left.

21:27.272 --> 21:29.554
She hasn't shown any
signs of coming back.

21:29.555 --> 21:32.776
- Pete and Logan will talk to her.
- If she doesn't come?

21:32.778 --> 21:35.144
She's our best tracker
and she knows it.

21:36.246 --> 21:37.446
She'll come.

21:40.082 --> 21:41.283
She'll come.

21:42.685 --> 21:46.354
Emcee: And the winner of the
Best New Agency Award goes to...

21:46.356 --> 21:48.290

21:52.995 --> 21:54.430
Whoo-oo-oo!

21:58.134 --> 22:00.535
- Congratulations, well earned.
- Thank you.

22:00.537 --> 22:02.170
(Indistinct chatter)

22:05.508 --> 22:09.678
Philip: Well, this started
as a simple print ad campaign.

22:09.679 --> 22:13.277
Protect your family,
it's a universal concept.

22:13.347 --> 22:17.552
There's nothing new here...
except what we decided to do next.

22:17.554 --> 22:19.119
For an additional
dollar a year,

22:19.121 --> 22:22.177
they now offer coverage
for the zombie apocalypse.

22:22.178 --> 22:24.044
(Mixed chuckles)

22:24.327 --> 22:25.893
The numbers shot
through the roof

22:25.895 --> 22:29.582
just by shifting an old
concept to a new generation.

22:29.583 --> 22:32.745
All we're selling
is what people already want -

22:32.746 --> 22:33.945
family.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.103
And to protect
the ones we love.

22:36.105 --> 22:38.072
(Cellphone buzzing)
So I'm honoured

22:38.074 --> 22:41.575
that this campaign landed us

22:41.577 --> 22:43.810
best new agency
of the year.

22:43.812 --> 22:47.110
So thank you
to Cassie Awards

22:47.227 --> 22:48.799
and to my own family.

22:48.817 --> 22:51.317
(Cheering, applause)

22:56.423 --> 22:59.158
- What is it?
- How come you didn't call Jeremy back?

22:59.160 --> 23:00.861
I haven't had a chance yet.

23:00.863 --> 23:04.063
A girl was killed by a Mutt in Bear Valley.
Jeremy called a meet.

23:04.065 --> 23:07.256
<i>He expects us all to be there,
it's a family obligation.</i>

23:07.435 --> 23:10.371
Not my family anymore,
so not my obligation.

23:10.372 --> 23:12.872
Just call him back.
You know you have to.

23:16.410 --> 23:19.144
Or at least meet me
and I can tell you what I know.

23:21.447 --> 23:23.649
Fine. Tomorrow, first thing.

23:25.886 --> 23:28.353
(Mixed chatter)

23:38.709 --> 23:41.839
You really think I wouldn't
smell him on my way in?

23:41.840 --> 23:43.740
Seriously...

23:44.071 --> 23:47.024
I may not be garden fresh,
but I don't smell that bad.

23:48.074 --> 23:49.607
Come here.
(Chuckling)

23:51.177 --> 23:52.610
I missed you, kid.

23:52.612 --> 23:54.979
- It's good to see you too.
- You look great.

23:54.981 --> 23:58.075
But if you're here to spring more of
this "us" stuff on me, just tell me now.

23:58.076 --> 23:59.851
No, no, everyone else
is in Stonehaven.

23:59.853 --> 24:01.619
I was supposed to start
the North American leg

24:01.621 --> 24:04.088
of the Neil Young tour.
Instead,

24:04.090 --> 24:05.890
I'll be heading
to the house tomorrow.

24:05.892 --> 24:08.192
See, that's the
thing, right?

24:08.194 --> 24:10.494
We all have
our lives here.

24:10.496 --> 24:13.297
He expects us to just
pick up and rush back.

24:13.299 --> 24:15.832
You're... you're just building
your client base, right?

24:15.834 --> 24:18.088
- You can't leave them.
- Yeah, it's getting sorted out.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.571
It's not like Jeremy's calling
us back for a tea party.

24:20.573 --> 24:23.837
This Mutt does anything
to shine light on our existence,

24:24.006 --> 24:26.171
we don't have these
lives for much longer.

24:27.712 --> 24:31.014
- Which Mutt killed the girl?
- Jeremy doesn't know.

24:31.016 --> 24:32.740
He caught the scent,
but he can't place it.

24:32.741 --> 24:35.652
Well, that's easy. Which one's the
most pissed off at Clay right now?

24:35.654 --> 24:36.887
Besides you?

24:40.257 --> 24:42.858
Clay is reason enough
for me not to go back.

24:42.860 --> 24:46.368
A girl was killed, Elena,
right outside Stonehaven.

24:49.355 --> 24:50.855
The Pack needs you.

24:51.069 --> 24:53.836
What about
what I need? Huh?

24:54.905 --> 24:56.606
My life is here now.

24:56.608 --> 25:00.042
It's... it's a normal existence
where people go to brunch

25:00.044 --> 25:02.945
a-and they don't murder
to hide their secrets!

25:04.151 --> 25:06.131
I just wanna be normal.

25:06.396 --> 25:09.884
Sweetheart, that ship
sailed years ago.

25:13.529 --> 25:16.950
Elena: What if I pop by your office,
to make sure you're there?

25:16.951 --> 25:21.141
I'll be there. However, the doors
are locked on Sundays, so...

25:21.142 --> 25:22.879
How convenient.

25:24.787 --> 25:27.512
- Buzz me, I'll come down and get you.
- You know I won't.

25:28.372 --> 25:30.498
P.S., I know you're going
to be in a sports bar,

25:30.499 --> 25:32.298
with a beer,
watching football.

25:32.300 --> 25:34.666
That is not true.
I'll be watching golf.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.426
You're sure there's nothing
I can do to convince you to...

25:37.428 --> 25:39.831
stay here and watch
me try on dresses?

25:39.867 --> 25:43.165
Mm, nice try.
She's your best friend.

25:44.734 --> 25:46.901
For the million things
that I love about Diane,

25:46.903 --> 25:50.317
her deep, deep passion for
shopping is not one of them.

25:50.318 --> 25:51.740
Well, the fact that
you're doing this anyway,

25:51.742 --> 25:54.009
because it makes her happy,
is possibly number one

25:54.011 --> 25:56.077
in the million reasons
why I love you.

25:56.079 --> 25:58.679
Really?
That's number one?

25:58.687 --> 26:01.016
Yeah... right
this second.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.652
You're just trying to convince
me that I should do this.

26:03.654 --> 26:06.054
- Is it working?
- No. (Doorbell ringing)

26:07.389 --> 26:08.923
- Have fun.
- Mm-hmm.

26:12.979 --> 26:14.651
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:15.365 --> 26:19.179
There's pomegranate juice in the fridge
and coconut ice cream in the freezer.

26:19.180 --> 26:20.855
Bless you!

26:21.138 --> 26:24.273
- Hi.
- Hey. Ready?

26:24.674 --> 26:27.875
So, my designer pal hooked me up
with a little bit of everything for you.

26:27.877 --> 26:31.011
And I made sure they'll all be dresses
that would meet my mother's approval.

26:31.013 --> 26:32.946
So if that one
doesn't work...

26:36.442 --> 26:39.188
Wow. That one works.

26:39.684 --> 26:41.497
I think we're
done here.

26:42.270 --> 26:43.719
Really...?

26:44.159 --> 26:45.559
The first one?

26:46.376 --> 26:48.125
Uhh...

26:48.631 --> 26:50.185
I do kind of love it.

26:50.193 --> 26:51.524
When you find
the one you love,

26:51.525 --> 26:54.490
you can search all you want
and you're gonna come back to it.

26:57.115 --> 27:01.075
- To the first dress.
- Damn you for looking so good in it.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.242
It's not like I'm gonna
upstage the bride.

27:03.243 --> 27:05.263
No, you're gonna
upstage me.

27:05.368 --> 27:08.189
Man 1's voice: <i>20 bucks
says I bang the blond.</i>

27:08.728 --> 27:10.661
Man 2's voice:
<i>I'd like to see you try.</i>

27:12.396 --> 27:15.898
If anyone's gonna upstage
the bride, it's your mother.

27:15.900 --> 27:18.293
You joke,
but you're right.

27:21.738 --> 27:23.072
Did we order these?

27:23.074 --> 27:25.441
They're courtesy of the
gentlemen at the bar.

27:29.079 --> 27:31.614
He also wanted me
to give you this.

27:37.336 --> 27:39.104
Let me handle this.

27:39.144 --> 27:42.342
Uh... go get him, tiger.

27:44.128 --> 27:45.556
- Well, hello.
- Hi.

27:45.557 --> 27:47.914
- I see you got my message.
- I did.

27:47.915 --> 27:51.209
But you see, I'm having a really nice
drink with my boyfriend's sister.

27:51.274 --> 27:54.000
Boyfriend.
Lucky guy.

27:55.471 --> 27:57.105
Let me ask you...

27:57.107 --> 27:59.974
The drinks I understand,
but this?

27:59.976 --> 28:03.578
Did you really think giving me the
key to your hotel room would work?

28:03.580 --> 28:07.515
- Nothing ventured.
- Thanks, but no thanks.

28:07.517 --> 28:08.816
Oh, just like that?

28:08.818 --> 28:10.417
Ugh... ah!

28:10.419 --> 28:12.431
Ahh, please,
I was just joking!

28:12.856 --> 28:14.991
Uh... Elena?

28:18.694 --> 28:20.094
Are you okay?

28:20.096 --> 28:22.696
I'm fine. Look, can we
just keep this between us?

28:22.698 --> 28:26.287
I'm not gonna pry, but...
Screw it, I'm gonna pry.

28:26.835 --> 28:28.168
What was that?

28:29.570 --> 28:33.873
I mean, there's usually only one reason
women know that kind of self-defence.

28:35.776 --> 28:39.412
Sometimes it's to prevent
anything bad from happening.

28:40.881 --> 28:44.449
Other times, it's to prevent
those things from happening again.

28:45.886 --> 28:48.487
The thing about bad families
is they make it easy

28:48.489 --> 28:50.522
to know when you've
landed in a good one.

28:50.524 --> 28:52.992
How quickly you forget
about my mother.
