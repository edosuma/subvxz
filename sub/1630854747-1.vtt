(birds chirp)

00:47.721 --> 00:50.577
(footsteps thudding)

00:50.577 --> 00:51.410
- Anything?

00:52.771 --> 00:54.213
- Looks a bit treacherous.

00:55.291 --> 00:56.810
I think we should keep on moving.

00:56.810 --> 00:57.843
- Oh, come on.

00:57.843 --> 00:59.765
Where's the daredevil in you, huh?

00:59.765 --> 01:01.746
Let's document it.

01:01.746 --> 01:03.040
I can take a few shots.

01:05.199 --> 01:10.203

(birds chirp)

01:32.311 --> 01:33.936
This is amazing!

01:35.791 --> 01:38.346
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

01:38.346 --> 01:40.268
If what they're saying
on the news is correct,

01:40.268 --> 01:43.631
this could be the biggest
natural disaster in history.

01:43.631 --> 01:45.673
In a matter of days.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.519
- That's why we've gotta get out of dodge.

01:47.519 --> 01:49.426
(camera shutter clicking)
(camera beeping)

01:49.426 --> 01:52.188
- Come on, what's a few photos?

01:52.188 --> 01:55.401
I mean, they just said it
might happen in a few days.

01:55.401 --> 01:58.436
- Yeah, and I bet that's what
they said at Pompeii too.

01:59.556 --> 02:02.246
(thunder cracking)

02:02.246 --> 02:05.042
- All right, come on, let's go.

02:07.981 --> 02:09.512
- There's no signal.

02:09.512 --> 02:12.610
We better get back to
the car where it's safe.

02:12.610 --> 02:16.446
(suspenseful music continues)

02:18.411 --> 02:20.481

(tree trunk cracking)

02:21.536 --> 02:24.467
- Ooh, whoa!

02:24.467 --> 02:27.867
Oh.

02:27.867 --> 02:28.700
Oh shit!

02:28.700 --> 02:30.003
- What is it?

02:31.175 --> 02:34.095
(thunder rumbling)

02:36.770 --> 02:38.515
(thunder rumbling)

02:38.515 --> 02:39.348
Crap!

02:41.551 --> 02:43.844
(lightning striking)
(tree trunk cracking)

02:43.844 --> 02:44.678
- Run!

(lightning striking)

03:00.327 --> 03:04.163
(suspenseful music continues)

03:07.633 --> 03:08.717
- Go, go, go!

03:09.604 --> 03:13.684
(car engine sputtering)

03:13.684 --> 03:16.345
I thought you said it wasn't
supposed to pick up so fast?

03:16.345 --> 03:17.452
- Everything said it wouldn't.

03:17.452 --> 03:19.649
I just don't get it.

03:19.649 --> 03:21.246
It's not starting.

03:21.246 --> 03:23.374
- Right, come on!

03:23.374 --> 03:25.876
(car beeping)

03:29.402 --> 03:31.140
(suspenseful music continues)

03:31.140 --> 03:32.529
- Get out.

03:32.529 --> 03:33.529
Get out now!

03:36.239 --> 03:37.778
- It won't open!

03:37.778 --> 03:38.660
It won't open!

03:38.660 --> 03:40.667
I can't get out!

03:40.667 --> 03:42.002
I can't get out!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.641
(thunder cracking)

03:44.641 --> 03:45.975
I can't get out!

03:46.825 --> 03:51.029

03:51.029 --> 03:54.092
(footsteps thudding)
(investigator groaning)

03:54.092 --> 03:55.149
- Shit.

03:55.149 --> 03:57.708
(thunder cracking)
(investigator groaning)

03:57.708 --> 03:58.541
Linda, no!

04:00.367 --> 04:03.429
(ground cracking)

04:03.429 --> 04:06.739
Linda! (whimpers)

04:06.739 --> 04:11.743

(lightning striking)

04:18.608 --> 04:21.527
(thunder cracking)

04:24.235 --> 04:25.586
- [Radio Announcer] The
lightning storm last night

04:25.586 --> 04:27.958
has been described as a mega storm.

04:27.958 --> 04:31.501
Dr. Becker, a researcher at the NSSL,

04:31.501 --> 04:34.383
warns that these storms
could become more commonplace

04:34.383 --> 04:36.695
in the wake of global warming.

04:36.695 --> 04:38.767
Some of his working
theories on these storms

04:38.767 --> 04:42.430
from research of similar
in Iceland have so far

04:42.430 --> 04:44.384
been dismissed by rival experts.

04:45.673 --> 04:48.747
Another storm has been
forecast in the coming days.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.287
The previous one was far more aggressive

04:51.287 --> 04:53.103
than experts had believed.

04:53.103 --> 04:56.001
Two people have been reported dead.

04:56.001 --> 04:58.375
Dr. Becker warns that further storms could

04:58.375 --> 05:02.189
prove unpredictable and potentially
a severe threat to life.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.846
(car engine humming)

05:16.048 --> 05:17.946
(car door bangs)

05:17.946 --> 05:21.032
(footsteps thudding)

05:22.877 --> 05:24.885
- Come on, come on, answer.

05:24.885 --> 05:26.236
- Sorry.
- Oh my God.

05:26.236 --> 05:27.070
You scared the crap out of me.

05:27.070 --> 05:28.478
- Didn't mean to startle you.

05:28.478 --> 05:30.290
- Oh, I just think it's this storm.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.241
It's gotten me a little shaky.

05:32.241 --> 05:34.283
And I seem to have
something wrong with my car,

05:34.283 --> 05:35.664
and I can't get ahold of my husband

05:35.664 --> 05:37.466
to come out here and fix it.

05:37.466 --> 05:38.847
- I could take a look.

05:38.847 --> 05:39.681
- I don't wanna trouble you.

05:39.681 --> 05:42.030
You know, I just live about
10 minutes up the road.

05:42.030 --> 05:44.462
It's just that I can't seem
to get ahold of my husband

05:44.462 --> 05:47.734
to come out here and save me. (chuckles)

05:47.734 --> 05:48.725
- What's the matter?

05:48.725 --> 05:49.899
Were there devils here?

05:51.427 --> 05:53.958
Hey, how about I drop
you off on my way home?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.751
How about that?
- Oh, you know, that's okay.

05:55.751 --> 05:58.964
I appreciate the offer, but no thank you.

05:58.964 --> 06:00.566
- Well, if it's only 10
minutes away, it's no problem.

06:00.566 --> 06:01.576
- Yeah, you know what?

06:01.576 --> 06:02.687
I'm just gonna wait for my husband.

06:02.687 --> 06:05.419
I'm gonna try and give him
a call again, actually.

06:05.419 --> 06:06.339
Thank you though.
- Are you sure?

06:06.339 --> 06:08.924
- Yeah, thank you.
- Okay, okay.

06:12.251 --> 06:17.255
(footsteps thudding)
(traffic humming)

06:27.731 --> 06:30.483
(car door bangs)

06:35.260 --> 06:38.262
(suspenseful music)

06:42.333 --> 06:43.401
(victim gasping)

06:43.401 --> 06:48.405
(muffled shouting)
(suspenseful music continues)

07:06.654 --> 07:10.574
- The air breathes of
honesty and most sweetly.

07:12.142 --> 07:16.744
(suspenseful music continues)

07:16.744 --> 07:19.830
(car engine humming)

07:25.720 --> 07:28.730
(crickets chirping)

07:28.730 --> 07:31.816
(car engine humming)

07:33.075 --> 07:36.987
- You have a good time?
- Yeah, thanks.

07:36.987 --> 07:39.120
- Maybe we'll go out
again some other time.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.412
- You know, I actually, I had fun.

07:44.412 --> 07:45.512
I'm not usually...

07:46.507 --> 07:48.328
Well, usually not into
the adventuring style.

07:48.328 --> 07:50.417
- Yeah, well that's why
we practice indoors.

07:50.417 --> 07:52.398
Take it outdoors and
then we'll scale over it.

07:52.398 --> 07:53.509
- Shut up.

07:53.509 --> 07:54.920
- Yeah, we've gotta stay
away from the mountains

07:54.920 --> 07:55.754
near Rough Rock Lake though.

07:55.754 --> 07:56.588
Did you hear about that fellow

07:56.588 --> 07:58.075
getting vaporized by lightning?

07:58.075 --> 07:59.337
- Yeah, I read about that.

07:59.337 --> 08:00.921
- That'll shocking.

08:02.311 --> 08:04.313
- Stop it, that's awful.

08:06.522 --> 08:07.564
- Anyways, you and your sister will be

08:07.564 --> 08:09.152
able to host tomorrow?

08:09.152 --> 08:12.748
- Yeah, and well I text Sally
and Donal, they're coming.

08:12.748 --> 08:14.767
And Michael And Charlie can't make it.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.295
- Well, Charlie's a twat.

08:16.295 --> 08:18.785
There's no loss there.

08:18.785 --> 08:22.064
- Yeah, my parents will be
leaving I think early afternoon,

08:22.064 --> 08:23.274
so I'll text you.

08:23.274 --> 08:24.712
- Well, me and Paulie will sort out booze.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.267
What do you like?

08:26.267 --> 08:28.223
- Don't do anything too strong.

08:28.223 --> 08:29.641
- Girls' drink.

08:29.641 --> 08:30.887
- Right, it's 2022.

08:30.887 --> 08:33.295
You can't say things like that, you pig.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.214
- Well, what do you want then?

08:36.674 --> 08:39.593
- Something fruity or like G and T.

08:40.652 --> 08:42.324
- You mean like a girl's drink?

08:42.324 --> 08:43.651
- Right, if I didn't like you so much,

08:43.651 --> 08:44.855
I'd cut your balls off.

08:45.810 --> 08:49.177
- Well.

08:49.177 --> 08:50.011
- Not.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.192
Not here.

08:53.192 --> 08:56.260
Not in the car, like just
get that out of your head.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.788
- You're getting me so worked up.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.555
- Not when my parents are 30 yards away.

09:00.555 --> 09:01.811
- Yeah.

09:01.811 --> 09:03.214
You want the moment to be worth it.

09:03.214 --> 09:04.048
- Yeah.

09:05.599 --> 09:06.433
Thank you.

09:09.188 --> 09:10.760
- For what?

09:10.760 --> 09:12.825
- For being patient and...

09:14.156 --> 09:15.751
- No, don't be silly, it's fine.

09:15.751 --> 09:18.855
Go home, have a cold
shower, sort myself out.

09:18.855 --> 09:21.440
(Meg chuckles)

09:22.533 --> 09:24.365
- You're fed up with me.

09:24.365 --> 09:25.446
- Look, I don't...

09:25.446 --> 09:26.885
Despite what Paulie might say about me,

09:26.885 --> 09:28.226
I'm not a player, all right?

09:28.226 --> 09:29.060
- Okay.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.130
- I'm in there for the long haul.

09:30.130 --> 09:32.031
I don't wanna ruin this by rushing it.

09:33.312 --> 09:34.363
You should go inside.

09:35.234 --> 09:36.936
- Yeah, okay.

09:36.936 --> 09:38.540
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.771
Hey.

09:40.771 --> 09:42.245
- And we'll keep it PG-13.

09:42.245 --> 09:44.069
- Okay, bye.

09:44.069 --> 09:45.070
- All right.

09:47.432 --> 09:49.405
(car door bangs)

09:49.405 --> 09:52.324
(gravel crunching)

09:57.761 --> 10:00.384
(door knob rattles)

10:00.384 --> 10:03.469
(door creaks softly)

10:04.611 --> 10:07.030
(door bangs)

10:08.729 --> 10:09.915
(thunder rumbling)

10:09.915 --> 10:11.333
- [Bernie] Kiddo?

10:13.188 --> 10:15.858
(loud rumbling)

10:23.255 --> 10:25.386
(soft chattering on TV)

10:25.386 --> 10:27.470
- Dad, did you feel that?

10:28.628 --> 10:32.131
- Yeah, they said on the news
to expect some heavy thunder.

10:32.131 --> 10:35.577
They've even told us the
warning stay indoors.

10:35.577 --> 10:37.209
It's a load of crock, isn't it?

10:39.007 --> 10:40.959
Who was in the car?

10:40.959 --> 10:43.000
- Spanish Inquisition?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.492
- No, it's Mastermind, Dad's edition.

10:45.492 --> 10:46.326
So?

10:47.354 --> 10:49.068
- Just a friend, whatever.

10:50.056 --> 10:50.890
- Mm.

10:51.948 --> 10:52.781
How was uni then?

10:52.781 --> 10:54.290
- Yeah, it's good.

10:54.290 --> 10:56.181
Looks all right. (laughs)

10:56.181 --> 10:58.737
- Look, when your mother
and I go on this weekend,

10:58.737 --> 11:01.015
we don't want any shenanigans.

11:01.015 --> 11:02.847
- Shouldn't it be you
two I'm worried about

11:02.847 --> 11:03.988
causing the shenanigans?

11:03.988 --> 11:06.437
- No, well, but we've got plenty
of experience, haven't we?

11:06.437 --> 11:07.686
And we pay the bills.

11:07.686 --> 11:10.010
I don't wanna come back here
and find this place trashed.

11:10.010 --> 11:11.640
- Okay.

11:11.640 --> 11:12.925
What are you reading?

11:12.925 --> 11:16.688
- Oh, it's a report on the
lightning the other day.

11:16.688 --> 11:20.442
Says that we could be getting
in for more occurrences,

11:20.442 --> 11:22.186
sometimes even more dangerous.

11:23.243 --> 11:25.666
(chuckles) Some crackpot in here says

11:25.666 --> 11:28.278
that he thinks the lightning is tuned

11:28.278 --> 11:30.050
to the electric current in the human body.

11:30.050 --> 11:32.091
- Should you even be going away then?

11:32.091 --> 11:33.472
If it's that dangerous?

11:33.472 --> 11:35.004
Why can't you just stay here?

11:36.534 --> 11:40.435
- Look, your mother will lose
her shit if we don't go away.

11:40.435 --> 11:43.140
We booked this trip ages ago.

11:43.140 --> 11:44.462
It's a fairly safe journey,

11:44.462 --> 11:46.301
and it's only two hours on the motorway.

11:46.301 --> 11:48.965
- I know, I just don't want you going,

11:48.965 --> 11:50.124
and then the roads are gonna be closed,

11:50.124 --> 11:52.989
and then you can't find a way
back if something happens.

11:52.989 --> 11:54.430
- Your mother's not gonna complain

11:54.430 --> 11:55.964
if we get stuck in the resort.

11:57.559 --> 11:58.393
- Okay.

11:59.444 --> 12:00.708
Just drive safe.

12:01.666 --> 12:03.350
- Oh, Man United lost.

12:03.350 --> 12:05.162
- Dad, you know we have the internet.

12:05.162 --> 12:07.850
I could have told you that last night.

12:07.850 --> 12:11.112
- Isn't it passed your bedtime?

12:11.112 --> 12:12.618
- What time is it?

12:12.618 --> 12:14.459
- 10:30.
- 10:30.

12:14.459 --> 12:17.939
Yeah, I'm not 12 anymore, Dad, seriously.

12:17.939 --> 12:18.773
- Avante.

12:20.979 --> 12:22.143
- Love you.

12:22.143 --> 12:23.377
- Love you too.

12:24.215 --> 12:25.716
- Bye.
- Bye, love.

12:28.667 --> 12:33.018
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

12:33.018 --> 12:36.021
(muffled screaming)

12:42.630 --> 12:45.549
(prisoner panting)

12:48.937 --> 12:51.428
(suspenseful music continues)

12:51.428 --> 12:54.431
(muffled screaming)

12:57.464 --> 13:01.301
(suspenseful music continues)

13:04.352 --> 13:07.272
- Thou hast now to wait 12 winters.

13:12.075 --> 13:14.389
Don't you realize no one's coming for you?

13:17.029 --> 13:18.713
This is your life now.

13:20.992 --> 13:23.694
They've already stopped
talking about you on the news.

13:24.835 --> 13:26.577
All they're talking
about is this lightning,

13:26.577 --> 13:29.192
and how everyone has to stay indoors.

13:31.099 --> 13:33.272
(suspenseful music continues)

13:33.272 --> 13:34.723
They didn't even mention you.

13:38.437 --> 13:42.287
(kidnapper chuckles)

13:42.287 --> 13:43.571
(prisoner whimpers)

13:43.571 --> 13:48.412
Temper and his wizard,
delicate wench. (chuckles)

13:48.412 --> 13:50.463
(thunder rumbling)

13:50.463 --> 13:53.215
(spoon clanging)

13:58.223 --> 13:59.574
- You've used all the milk.

14:02.366 --> 14:03.760
Can I have your yogurt then?

14:03.760 --> 14:04.593
- Don't look at me.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.494
- Oh, you're such a dickhead.

14:06.494 --> 14:10.323
- (chuckles) One of them,
but you owe me another.

14:10.323 --> 14:11.764
- Yeah, I'll get you a luxurious one

14:11.764 --> 14:14.797
with gold sprinkles on top.

14:14.797 --> 14:16.216
- Sounds good.

14:16.216 --> 14:19.135
(cereal crunching)

14:21.012 --> 14:22.096
- That is rank.

14:24.855 --> 14:26.567
It's out of date.

14:26.567 --> 14:28.049
- Why do you think I'm having cereal?

14:28.049 --> 14:29.800
- Oh my God, asshole.

14:30.722 --> 14:33.322
- Come, you all set for later?

14:33.322 --> 14:34.433
- Yeah.

14:34.433 --> 14:36.775
- Okay, the boys are definitely coming.

14:36.775 --> 14:37.916
Is Sally and her boyfriend still coming?

14:37.916 --> 14:39.211
- Yes.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.249
- And what about...

14:41.249 --> 14:42.810
- Oh yeah, Paulie and Sean said they

14:42.810 --> 14:43.798
were gonna do a booze run.

14:43.798 --> 14:44.882
- Okay, okay.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.404
Well, as long as they're
not getting any cheap cider

14:47.404 --> 14:48.659
like in college.

14:48.659 --> 14:51.514
- No, I told him to
get G and T, obviously.

14:51.514 --> 14:53.013
- Good. (laughs)

14:53.013 --> 14:56.532
- Are you two contemplating
how much is it gonna cost me?

14:56.532 --> 14:57.763
- Nothing, Mom.

14:57.763 --> 14:59.324
- I know what you two are like.

14:59.324 --> 15:00.375
What are you scheming?

15:00.375 --> 15:01.996
- No, I just, I think we're gonna

15:01.996 --> 15:03.227
watch some films with Sally, aren't we?

15:03.227 --> 15:04.740
She's gonna be around.

15:04.740 --> 15:05.929
- [Di] What movie?

15:05.929 --> 15:09.743
- It's like a disaster
movie about fire tornadoes.

15:09.743 --> 15:10.974
- You know, when I was your age,

15:10.974 --> 15:13.406
we'd usually have to be
drunk before we could

15:13.406 --> 15:15.841
watch a silly movie about a killer doll.

15:16.859 --> 15:20.371
Then we scared ourselves so
much that we couldn't sleep.

15:20.371 --> 15:23.764
- Creepy dolls are so the
early noughties. (chuckles)

15:23.764 --> 15:25.506
- Who's had all the milk?

15:25.506 --> 15:26.349
- Dad.
- Dad.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.592
- Black tea it is then.

15:31.271 --> 15:34.243
When we're gone, right, no
boys, no parties, no boozing,

15:34.243 --> 15:35.684
but for a couple of beers in the fridge,

15:35.684 --> 15:37.005
and that's your limit, ladies.

15:37.005 --> 15:37.839
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:37.839 --> 15:38.690
- Thanks, Mom.

15:40.969 --> 15:42.500
She still thinks we're kids, doesn't she?

15:42.500 --> 15:45.041
- But don't tell her
because she'll parent.

15:45.041 --> 15:46.253
(sisters laughing)

15:46.253 --> 15:48.028
- Kiss a slice?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.837
Right, please tell me
that your mother's ready.

15:50.837 --> 15:52.003
- No.
- Ngh-ngh.

15:52.003 --> 15:53.452
- Look, I wanna get away soon.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.705
I wanna get off before those
bloody storm clouds come in.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.190
So what are you two doing today?

15:59.190 --> 16:01.178
- Just movies with Sally.

16:05.971 --> 16:09.222
- Look, get yourselves some
drinks or something, aye, girls?

16:09.222 --> 16:10.603
Have a nice time.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.779
- Oh.
- Bye.

16:11.779 --> 16:12.613
- Bye.

16:12.613 --> 16:14.747
All right, that should get us
an extra couple of bottles.

16:14.747 --> 16:16.608
- You know, he's still
working on 1980s time.

16:16.608 --> 16:18.587
Probably could buy a house with that.

16:19.601 --> 16:21.083
Thank you.
- Hey, what are you doing?

16:21.083 --> 16:23.335
- That's what you get
for being a milk thief.

16:24.955 --> 16:28.618
- Right, so Mom and Dad will
be gone in a couple of hours,

16:28.618 --> 16:30.150
and then we need to get ready

16:30.150 --> 16:31.751
'cause then the boys are coming.

16:34.328 --> 16:36.115
Hey, what is it?

16:36.115 --> 16:36.948
- Nothing.

16:39.468 --> 16:40.839
It's...

16:40.839 --> 16:45.222
It's just like Sean stuff.

16:45.222 --> 16:47.954
- Right, well, you don't need
to feel any pressure, right?

16:47.954 --> 16:50.447
It doesn't have to be this weekend.

16:50.447 --> 16:51.280
- I know.

16:52.278 --> 16:55.731
It's just with everything that happened

16:55.731 --> 16:57.209
with my ex and stuff.

16:58.553 --> 17:01.766
I just, I don't want him to get
like put off me or anything.

17:01.766 --> 17:05.819
- Look, if he does, he's
not worth it, right?

17:05.819 --> 17:07.381
But I don't think he will.

17:07.381 --> 17:08.522
- Okay.

17:08.522 --> 17:11.854
- Besides he can take care of
himself for the time being.

17:11.854 --> 17:14.028
Choke his chicken to his heart's content.

17:14.028 --> 17:15.396
- That's grim.

17:15.396 --> 17:16.778
(both laughing)

17:16.778 --> 17:19.779
- It is a bit. (laughs)

17:19.779 --> 17:24.783
(somber music)
(birds chirping)

17:37.409 --> 17:39.410
- I must have missed it.

17:41.322 --> 17:43.624
I think it might rain soon, you know.

17:43.624 --> 17:45.753
Did you hear about the
thunder om the news?

17:45.753 --> 17:48.845
- Yeah, that's why we're going
to Meg's for the weekend.

17:48.845 --> 17:51.920
We'll be fine here until the bus comes.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.562
- Yeah, but how long?

17:55.517 --> 17:56.350
- An hour.

17:57.573 --> 17:58.560
- I know, we'll get an early start.

18:00.382 --> 18:03.134
(both chuckling)

18:07.941 --> 18:08.992
Promise me something.

18:09.899 --> 18:11.394
- What?

18:11.394 --> 18:13.138
- No silly, drunken dancing.

18:14.096 --> 18:16.108
- When have I ever drunken danced?

18:16.108 --> 18:19.471
- Uh, my sister's wedding, prom.

18:19.471 --> 18:21.773
Literally every single
night at student union.

18:22.683 --> 18:24.698
- Okay, fine, point taken.

18:26.359 --> 18:31.364
(somber music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

18:32.562 --> 18:34.944
- Thunder really freaks me out.

18:34.944 --> 18:37.946
(suspenseful music)

18:42.457 --> 18:43.851
- Bloody hell, love.

18:43.851 --> 18:46.553
You turn the water mains off
before you pulled the sink out?

18:46.553 --> 18:49.195
- Very funny, could you help?

18:49.195 --> 18:50.457
- Don't worry, girls.

18:50.457 --> 18:51.447
We'll be back.

18:51.447 --> 18:54.090
Even though your mum's
packing off for a migration.

18:54.090 --> 18:55.501
- Yeah, you paid the mortgage
off though, aren't you?

18:55.501 --> 18:57.122
We'll be fine.

18:57.122 --> 18:58.443
- Did you hear that, Di?

18:58.443 --> 19:00.037
That's our little 'un that is.

19:00.037 --> 19:01.830
- Dad, I'm not a kid!

19:01.830 --> 19:05.319
- Oh, you'll always be my baby. (laughs)

19:05.319 --> 19:06.370
- Okay.

19:06.370 --> 19:09.823
- If there's anything you
need, all right, I've got this.

19:09.823 --> 19:10.934
My fifth limb.

19:10.934 --> 19:12.765
So don't be thinking that you can't call.

19:12.765 --> 19:15.397
I can hunt you down all over the country.

19:15.397 --> 19:16.748
- I'll see you, Mom.
- Bye, Mom.

19:16.748 --> 19:18.396
- Bye, Meg.
- Love you.

19:18.396 --> 19:19.497
Bye, Dad.
- Bye, Dad!

19:20.575 --> 19:21.999
- See ya!
- Bye.

19:21.999 --> 19:24.452
I wanna beat this storm front.

19:24.452 --> 19:25.453
- Bye!
- Bye!

19:30.690 --> 19:32.937
- All right, so I reckon
we get some drinks,

19:32.937 --> 19:34.706
and we start getting ready.

19:38.235 --> 19:41.126
(rain pouring)
(thunder rumbling)

19:41.126 --> 19:45.265
Sally and Donal are running
late, missed the bus.

19:45.265 --> 19:47.731
(rain pouring)

19:47.731 --> 19:50.734
(suspenseful music)

19:56.726 --> 19:58.937
(thunder rumbling)

19:58.937 --> 20:01.689
(water dripping)

20:06.445 --> 20:09.364
(thunder rumbling)

20:12.615 --> 20:16.451
(suspenseful music continues)

20:18.914 --> 20:21.583
(food slopping)

20:25.518 --> 20:29.354
(suspenseful music continues)

20:32.713 --> 20:35.632
(thunder rumbling)

20:36.725 --> 20:41.236
(suspenseful music continues)

20:41.236 --> 20:44.071
(spoon clanging)

20:44.071 --> 20:46.991
(thunder rumbling)

20:50.344 --> 20:53.347
(footsteps tapping)

20:57.457 --> 20:59.459
- Oh forgive me my sins.

21:00.573 --> 21:03.492
(thunder rumbling)

21:05.082 --> 21:07.751
(keys jangling)

21:11.620 --> 21:14.289
(door creaking)

21:16.896 --> 21:18.205
Shit.

21:18.205 --> 21:21.124
(thunder cracking)

21:25.416 --> 21:28.031
Awake, dear heart, awake.

21:29.499 --> 21:31.304
Thou hast slept well.

21:32.343 --> 21:34.525
(head butting)

21:34.525 --> 21:36.452
- Help me, help me, somebody help me!

21:36.452 --> 21:39.140
- Silence, one more word
and I will chide thee!

21:43.454 --> 21:46.373
(thunder rumbling)

21:48.265 --> 21:50.186
Lie there, mine heart.

21:50.186 --> 21:51.567
Wipe thine eyes.

21:54.111 --> 21:55.194
Have comfort.

22:02.441 --> 22:05.360
(thunder rumbling)

22:06.944 --> 22:09.697
(spoon clanging)

22:10.961 --> 22:12.318
You will behave tonight.

22:14.243 --> 22:17.163
(thunder cracking)

22:18.637 --> 22:21.813
(spoon clanging)

22:21.813 --> 22:24.315
(mouth spits)

22:29.579 --> 22:32.041
- Please, just let me go.

22:32.041 --> 22:33.643
I won't tell anybody, I promise.

22:36.305 --> 22:39.377
- Just a few more days, then I'll

22:41.109 --> 22:42.430
set you free.

22:42.430 --> 22:43.904
- Why are you doing this?

22:48.874 --> 22:51.530
- (chuckles) Because I can.

22:53.739 --> 22:56.709
- Please.
- No one's gonna stop me.

22:56.709 --> 22:59.727
- Please just let me go, I'm begging you.

23:02.096 --> 23:04.261
- Well demanded, wench.

23:06.043 --> 23:08.962
(thunder rumbling)

23:10.053 --> 23:12.062
I want to show you something.

23:13.779 --> 23:15.310
It's very special.

23:17.959 --> 23:21.760
For your eyes only. (chuckles)

23:37.045 --> 23:38.430
- Who are these girls?

23:40.457 --> 23:42.543
How, how could you do that?

23:44.136 --> 23:45.237
- It was quite simple.

23:47.524 --> 23:50.440
Strangely therapeutic.

23:53.529 --> 23:56.054
It takes great patience to do my work.

23:59.602 --> 24:03.534
To put a cut precisely
where it needs to be.

24:05.770 --> 24:07.298
- You're a fucking maniac.

24:10.698 --> 24:13.701
(suspenseful music)

24:18.257 --> 24:21.039
(prisoner groans)

24:21.039 --> 24:26.043
(muffled screaming)
(thunder cracking)

24:29.489 --> 24:34.493
(suspenseful music continues)
(muffled screaming)

24:35.227 --> 24:38.146
(thunder cracking)

24:41.040 --> 24:44.042
(muffled screaming)

24:46.048 --> 24:49.050
(knuckles knocking)

24:57.541 --> 25:00.127
(fist tapping)

25:04.562 --> 25:06.126
- Afternoon, girls.
- Hey.

25:06.126 --> 25:07.120
- Hey.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.412
Hi, how are you?
(lips smacking)

25:10.412 --> 25:11.828
- You two took your time.

25:11.828 --> 25:12.841
- Yeah, well, we were circling around,

25:12.841 --> 25:13.675
waiting for a green light.

25:13.675 --> 25:14.901
Look what we got.

25:14.901 --> 25:16.608
- Sally and her boyfriend
are running late.

25:16.608 --> 25:18.210
They couldn't catch the bus, so.

25:19.371 --> 25:20.361
- You didn't tell me we was hanging around

25:20.361 --> 25:21.512
with those two, did we?

25:28.839 --> 25:31.758
(bottles clanking)

25:33.726 --> 25:36.395
(hands tapping)

25:38.174 --> 25:41.177
(footsteps tapping)

25:42.877 --> 25:44.622
(liquor splashing)

25:44.622 --> 25:46.013
What do you think, they good?

25:46.013 --> 25:47.264
- Yeah, thanks.

25:48.892 --> 25:51.077
- Well.
- Thank you.

25:51.077 --> 25:54.800
- Here's to a delightful
weekend in the country.

25:54.800 --> 25:56.184
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:01.616 --> 26:05.549
- So when are Donal and Sally
actually gonna get here?

26:05.549 --> 26:07.201
- You know what, I don't even know.

26:07.201 --> 26:09.633
My phone's been lighting up as well so.

26:09.633 --> 26:10.950
Can't even get a hold of them.

26:10.950 --> 26:13.269
- Why did you park so far away?

26:13.269 --> 26:14.620
- It's easier to get out.

26:16.628 --> 26:19.541
- Sean can't parallel park.

26:19.541 --> 26:22.934
He'll hit anything and everything he can.

26:22.934 --> 26:27.050
Cars, bikes, people, small children.

26:28.158 --> 26:29.659
- Yeah, laugh it up, dickhead.

26:30.902 --> 26:32.366
How you getting home?

26:32.366 --> 26:34.403
- All right, children, stop it.

26:34.403 --> 26:37.436
- Right, I'd like to
propose a proper toast.

26:37.436 --> 26:38.970
To loved ones and good times.

26:40.078 --> 26:42.060
And to Meg.
- No, what?

26:42.060 --> 26:44.311
- No, seriously, even
though you're the youngest,

26:44.311 --> 26:45.302
you're the the most grounded.

26:45.302 --> 26:48.251
- Okay. (chuckles)

26:48.251 --> 26:49.786
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:54.670 --> 26:55.904
- So you got a jacuzzi?

26:56.982 --> 26:58.525
- Yeah, why?

26:58.525 --> 27:00.027
- You fancy a dip?

27:02.156 --> 27:02.990
- Okay.

27:06.212 --> 27:08.685
(crickets chirping)
(suspenseful music)

27:08.685 --> 27:09.986
- Ugh, no signal.

27:11.154 --> 27:14.547
- Probably because we're in
the middle of nowhere, Donal.

27:14.547 --> 27:16.949
- Maybe the storm's messing
with the connection.

27:18.840 --> 27:23.527
- Jesus, those clouds
are getting really close.

27:25.266 --> 27:26.698
Do you think we're safe here?

27:26.698 --> 27:29.469
(thunder cracking)

27:29.469 --> 27:30.670
- I could feel that one.

27:32.472 --> 27:34.093
- I'm scared.

27:34.093 --> 27:36.154
- Sure it's nothing to worry about.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.952
(thunder cracking)

27:38.952 --> 27:40.203
- Are you crazy?
- What?

27:41.431 --> 27:43.569
(suspenseful music continues)

27:43.569 --> 27:46.321
(Sally whimpers)

27:48.457 --> 27:51.430
(wind howling)

27:51.430 --> 27:52.264
(Sally groans)

27:52.264 --> 27:55.350
(lightning striking)

27:58.079 --> 28:00.566
- We have to run, run!

28:00.566 --> 28:04.718
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

28:04.718 --> 28:06.190
- Wait!

28:06.190 --> 28:07.256
- What?

28:07.256 --> 28:09.841
- I need to tell you something.

28:12.891 --> 28:16.875
(lightning striking)
(Donal groaning)

28:16.875 --> 28:18.420
- Donal?

28:18.420 --> 28:23.424
(thunder cracks)
(suspenseful music continues)

28:27.180 --> 28:29.364
- What time can we check in?

28:29.364 --> 28:30.865
- Any time we get there, love.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.212
- I am excited.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.844
- So am I.

28:35.844 --> 28:38.136
- But...
- What?

28:38.136 --> 28:40.018
- You bring the massage oils?

28:40.018 --> 28:44.819
- Bernie, get your mind
out of the gutter. (laughs)

28:44.819 --> 28:49.197
Yes, I did, along with the
kitchen sink, you silly sod.

28:49.197 --> 28:51.700
(Di chuckles)

28:53.919 --> 28:56.271
I'm slightly worried.

28:56.271 --> 28:58.635
That storm seems to be getting aggressive,

28:58.635 --> 29:00.708
and it's getting closer.

29:00.708 --> 29:02.866
- I think we're safe, love.

29:02.866 --> 29:05.669
These modern cars are
lightning proof, I think.

29:05.669 --> 29:06.990
- Lightning proof?

29:06.990 --> 29:08.702
They tell you that on
the forecourt, did they?

29:08.702 --> 29:11.107
- No, I think I saw it on Top Gear once.

29:12.724 --> 29:14.450
- Did you see that?

29:14.450 --> 29:15.283
That....

29:16.875 --> 29:18.920
- Hope the rain doesn't get any worse.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.802
Right-hand wiper doesn't work very well.

29:20.802 --> 29:23.264
- I keep telling you to replace it.

29:23.264 --> 29:24.798
- I'll get around to it.

29:25.899 --> 29:27.948
- How are you enjoying the log cabin

29:27.948 --> 29:29.209
in the garden by the way?

29:29.209 --> 29:31.730
- What cabin?

29:31.730 --> 29:35.154
- The one you said you were
going to build five years ago?

29:35.154 --> 29:39.687
I think the last update on that
was, "I'll get round to it."

29:39.687 --> 29:41.909
- You're winding up me now, dear.

29:41.909 --> 29:46.791
- 25 years and counting,
darling. (chuckles)

29:46.791 --> 29:48.618
(thunder cracking)

29:48.618 --> 29:51.621
(crickets chirping)

29:55.871 --> 29:58.693
- Hey, sure you're okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

29:58.693 --> 30:00.134
Yeah.
- Well, you look great.

30:00.134 --> 30:00.967
- Thanks.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.034
- Hey.

30:07.113 --> 30:10.228
(thunder rumbling)

30:10.228 --> 30:11.243
- Hmm?

30:11.243 --> 30:12.327
Oh, I'm fine.

30:14.634 --> 30:16.648
I'm just a bit worried
about Donal and Sally

30:16.648 --> 30:19.050
'cause I've not heard
from them, like all night.

30:20.251 --> 30:21.810
- Well, it may be that their parents

30:21.810 --> 30:23.434
are just being strict to them.

30:23.434 --> 30:24.575
It's been kind of mad lately, hasn't it?

30:24.575 --> 30:26.651
Like all these streets, locking them down.

30:26.651 --> 30:29.224
- Yeah, I know, I'm just
worried that they're out there.

30:29.224 --> 30:30.919
They're stuck in the storm.

30:30.919 --> 30:33.839
(thunder cracking)

30:35.534 --> 30:37.623
- Oh shit, that was nearer.

30:39.227 --> 30:41.813
- What, you think we should
just check the weather report?

30:41.813 --> 30:44.288
- No.
- What do you think?

30:44.288 --> 30:45.345
- I think...

30:45.345 --> 30:46.824
I don't think we should be in here.

30:46.824 --> 30:48.115
I think we should get out.

30:48.115 --> 30:50.306
- Just relax, we're here
to have a good time.

30:50.306 --> 30:51.182
- Yeah, just relax.

30:51.182 --> 30:52.016
Everything will be okay.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.896
- What if Donal and Sally are stuck in it?

30:53.896 --> 30:56.552
- Well, then they're gonna get
struck by lightning. (laughs)

30:56.552 --> 30:58.335
- Paulie, that's not funny.

30:58.335 --> 30:59.169
- [Sean] Well, it is a little bit.

30:59.169 --> 31:01.755
- I'm gonna go and check on them anyway.

31:01.755 --> 31:03.878
(water splashing)

31:03.878 --> 31:06.797
(thunder rumbling)

31:09.854 --> 31:12.523
(phone beeping)

31:15.791 --> 31:16.624
(phone beeping)

31:16.624 --> 31:17.458
No signal.

31:29.815 --> 31:32.949
(suspenseful music)

31:32.949 --> 31:34.756
(button clicks)

31:34.756 --> 31:37.684
(thunder cracks)

31:37.684 --> 31:41.520
(suspenseful music continues)

31:42.999 --> 31:45.119
(light bulb shatters)
(Meg gasps)

31:45.119 --> 31:48.955
(suspenseful music continues)

31:57.097 --> 31:59.094
- She's just worried about
her friends, that's all.

31:59.094 --> 32:01.205
- Yeah, but she's making a
big thing about going in.

32:01.205 --> 32:03.570
- She's not making a big
thing, just leave her alone.

32:03.570 --> 32:06.331
(thunder rumbles)

32:06.331 --> 32:07.490
Oh shit.

32:07.490 --> 32:08.779
Oh shit, Meg.

32:08.779 --> 32:10.125
(Paulie laughs)

32:10.125 --> 32:11.597
Paulie, it's not funny!

32:11.597 --> 32:13.313
- Well, it is a little bit.
- No, it's not!

32:13.313 --> 32:16.593
(Paulie laughs)

32:16.593 --> 32:19.513
(thunder rumbling)

32:21.805 --> 32:23.306
Are you all right?

32:25.421 --> 32:27.673
- Will Mom and Dad be okay?

32:28.780 --> 32:29.662
- Yeah.

32:29.662 --> 32:33.175
Yeah, they'll be fine, don't be silly.

32:36.025 --> 32:38.937
Hey, don't be dramatic now, okay?

32:38.937 --> 32:40.191
That's my job, yeah?

32:41.401 --> 32:42.583
Fine.
- Okay.

32:42.583 --> 32:43.417
- Fine.

32:49.477 --> 32:52.538
(rain pouring)

32:52.538 --> 32:54.460
- Should we find cover somewhere?

32:54.460 --> 32:55.631
- Where?

32:55.631 --> 32:57.465
Look, we're just under an hour away.

32:58.971 --> 33:01.486
- It's pretty bad out there.

33:01.486 --> 33:04.278
I thought they said it was
fine to be out on the roads.

33:04.278 --> 33:06.260
- Well, technically they didn't say that.

33:06.260 --> 33:08.849
They actually said, "You
shouldn't leave your house

33:08.849 --> 33:10.470
"unless it's an emergency,

33:10.470 --> 33:12.685
"and you were coming in from the East."

33:12.685 --> 33:14.547
- Maybe we should turn back.

33:14.547 --> 33:16.267
- Look, it's only supposed to get rough

33:16.267 --> 33:17.163
in a couple more days.

33:17.163 --> 33:18.810
We're almost through this now.

33:18.810 --> 33:20.453
- Watch the road, love!

33:20.453 --> 33:22.370
Pull up, pull off the road!

33:22.370 --> 33:23.756
(tires screeching)

33:23.756 --> 33:26.842
(lightning striking)

33:29.559 --> 33:30.847
- Shit!
- Watch it!

33:32.980 --> 33:34.481
Ah, quick, Bernie!

33:36.292 --> 33:39.377
(lightning striking)

33:40.513 --> 33:41.748
(tires screeching)

33:41.748 --> 33:43.750
- Babe, we burst a tire!

33:44.598 --> 33:45.861
(tires screeching)

33:45.861 --> 33:48.896
- Quick, just pull up, pull up!

33:48.896 --> 33:51.816
(thunder rumbling)

33:55.352 --> 33:57.479
We have to move.

33:57.479 --> 33:59.104
Did you see what happened back there?

33:59.104 --> 34:00.875
Christ almighty.

34:00.875 --> 34:03.190
- I think we're by Riley's farm.

34:04.658 --> 34:06.510
The house is a couple of fields over.

34:07.357 --> 34:08.190
- Okay.

34:09.490 --> 34:12.152
(suspenseful music continues)

34:12.152 --> 34:15.154
(car doors banging)

34:16.338 --> 34:17.512
- Bloody tire's blown.

34:19.070 --> 34:21.713
- Look, the fields are out in the open.

34:21.713 --> 34:22.824
It's too dangerous.

34:22.824 --> 34:24.325
- The tele says it's better to be out here

34:24.325 --> 34:26.997
than under one of these trees
or stuck in this tin box.

34:26.997 --> 34:29.270
- Could we not just stay in the car?

34:29.270 --> 34:30.521
- Look out, Di!

34:31.728 --> 34:36.460
(lightning striking)
(explosion blasting)

34:36.460 --> 34:40.404
(suspenseful music continues)

34:40.404 --> 34:41.238
- Oh.

34:42.561 --> 34:46.397
(suspenseful music continues)

34:53.099 --> 34:54.213
- Get down.

34:54.213 --> 34:58.049
(suspenseful music continues)

34:59.949 --> 35:02.368
(Di panting)

35:05.152 --> 35:08.071
- What the?
- Jesus Christ, the car.

35:10.807 --> 35:13.118
They shouldn't let anyone
leave their houses.

35:15.007 --> 35:17.529
- Oh my God, there is no signal!

35:17.529 --> 35:18.910
I just want to call the girls.

35:18.910 --> 35:20.955
I can't get a signal.

35:20.955 --> 35:25.221
- Love, there's a house just...

35:25.221 --> 35:27.638
If we get to it first,
we can use their phone.

35:27.638 --> 35:30.150
(thunder cracking)

35:30.150 --> 35:31.236
Oh come, come on.

35:31.236 --> 35:33.222
Come on, love, calm down.

35:33.222 --> 35:35.751
It's gonna be all right.

35:35.751 --> 35:38.155
You got me.
- Yeah.

35:38.155 --> 35:39.226
- We're gonna be all right.

35:39.226 --> 35:40.605
- Yeah.

35:40.605 --> 35:42.436
- Come on.
- Okay.

35:42.436 --> 35:45.424
- Look, you've always been there.

35:45.424 --> 35:46.809
I don't know what these things mean.

35:46.809 --> 35:48.549
I forgot my glasses anyway.

35:48.549 --> 35:50.884
(Di laughs)

35:51.862 --> 35:53.030
- Okay, right.

35:54.297 --> 35:57.013
- [Bernie] Let's get to it.

35:57.013 --> 35:57.847
- Quick.

35:58.823 --> 36:01.157
It's okay, I've got the map.

36:05.241 --> 36:06.075
Look.

36:08.780 --> 36:10.114
Come on, Bernie.

36:14.317 --> 36:17.332
(suspenseful music continues)

36:17.332 --> 36:19.104
Bernie, move!

36:19.104 --> 36:21.195
(lightning striking)

36:21.195 --> 36:24.312
(tree cracking)
(leaves rustling)

36:24.312 --> 36:28.148
(suspenseful music continues)

36:30.819 --> 36:33.989
(lightning crackling)

36:37.013 --> 36:39.650
(suspenseful music continues)

36:39.650 --> 36:42.152
(Di whimpers)

36:44.317 --> 36:45.151
No!

36:48.270 --> 36:53.274
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

37:15.661 --> 37:20.013
- It seems to have
subsided a little, I think.

37:20.013 --> 37:21.596
- Yeah, maybe it's run it's course.

37:21.596 --> 37:24.266
(radio buzzing)

37:25.261 --> 37:27.808
Is there anything on the radio, man?

37:27.808 --> 37:30.360
- Nothing has changed.

37:30.360 --> 37:32.311
Can we just go back in the hot tub now?

37:33.848 --> 37:35.599
- I can still see the clouds above.

37:36.875 --> 37:40.165
Yeah, I can still see some
lightning crackling inside.

37:40.165 --> 37:41.892
- Hope Mom and Dad are okay.

37:43.631 --> 37:46.393
- There's no phone signals,
we're not gonna know anything.

37:46.393 --> 37:49.276
Just stop overthinking it, all right?

37:49.276 --> 37:51.050
- Hey Meg, they'll be fine.

37:54.020 --> 37:55.404
- All right, what do we do?

37:56.973 --> 38:00.835
- Why don't we go back out to the jacuzzi

38:00.835 --> 38:03.357
and chill the hell out?

38:03.357 --> 38:05.399
It's meant to be a party, guys.

38:05.399 --> 38:06.903
Bunch of sad sacks.

38:10.667 --> 38:15.672
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pouring)

38:19.011 --> 38:21.681
(door creaking)

38:25.071 --> 38:27.523
(suspenseful music continues)

38:27.523 --> 38:28.357
- Hello?

38:30.853 --> 38:31.687
Hello?

38:34.289 --> 38:37.272
(door creaking)

38:37.272 --> 38:41.108
(suspenseful music continues)

38:44.927 --> 38:45.761
Hello?

38:47.180 --> 38:50.099
(thunder rumbling)

38:54.006 --> 38:56.340
(Di groans)

38:57.770 --> 39:00.689
(thunder rumbling)

39:02.778 --> 39:05.551
(suspenseful music continues)

39:05.551 --> 39:07.971
- Darling, stop freaking out.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.773
- Okay.
- No, it's fine, I'm here.

39:09.773 --> 39:10.977
- Yeah, thanks.

39:14.727 --> 39:19.731
Sorry I don't like give you
what you want sometimes.

39:20.604 --> 39:24.438
It's just, I, like I have
to just take it slow.

39:24.438 --> 39:26.169
- There's no rushing, right?

39:27.221 --> 39:28.823
You know I like you a lot, yeah?

39:32.903 --> 39:34.418
(radio buzzing)

39:34.418 --> 39:37.286
Now we're talking.

39:37.286 --> 39:40.488
- [Radio Host] Reports are
saying this mega lightning storm

39:40.488 --> 39:42.320
is the worst ever recorded.

39:42.320 --> 39:45.202
Vehicles and buildings
have been destroyed.

39:45.202 --> 39:47.854
Old buildings like listed
buildings, cottages

39:47.854 --> 39:51.778
and farmhouses have been more
susceptible to the damage.

39:51.778 --> 39:54.643
One house in Meltonville
was completely destroyed

39:54.643 --> 39:56.333
with lightning causing severe damage

39:56.333 --> 39:58.493
and triggering a house fire.

39:59.763 --> 40:02.009
(phone ringing)
- Oh my God.

40:02.009 --> 40:02.848
It's my Mom.

40:02.848 --> 40:04.248
Mom, Mom?

40:04.248 --> 40:05.916
Mom?
- Meg, I'm fine.

40:08.938 --> 40:09.772
All right?

40:10.666 --> 40:12.418
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm...

40:17.531 --> 40:21.864
I'm at the windmill cottage, Southeast.

40:21.864 --> 40:23.597
- What are you doing there?

40:25.015 --> 40:28.261
- There was an accident, on the road.

40:31.801 --> 40:34.541
- Mom, are you okay?

40:34.541 --> 40:38.437
- I'm fine, I'm fine, all right?

40:38.437 --> 40:40.211
I'm still a little shaken.

40:41.859 --> 40:44.171
Look, I'll check back in with you later.

40:44.171 --> 40:45.582
Are you girls all right?

40:45.582 --> 40:46.416
- Yeah, we're fine.

40:46.416 --> 40:48.285
Now I'm gonna come, I'm
gonna come and get you.

40:48.285 --> 40:51.306
- No, it's dangerous.

40:51.306 --> 40:53.802
- No, I'm gonna come and
get you and Dad now, okay?

40:53.802 --> 40:55.941
Send me the address.

40:55.941 --> 40:57.592
- Just leave it.

40:57.592 --> 41:01.676
Meg, listen to me for
once in your life, okay?

41:01.676 --> 41:05.713
It is not safe to be out
on the roads, all right?

41:05.713 --> 41:08.242
I'll call back on you later.

41:08.242 --> 41:10.019
- I love you.

41:10.019 --> 41:11.227
- Love you too.

41:13.416 --> 41:14.557
(phone beeps)

41:14.557 --> 41:17.349
- Will you take me to
go find my mom and dad?

41:17.349 --> 41:18.190
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

41:18.190 --> 41:20.522
- They've been in an
accident and we need to go.

41:20.522 --> 41:22.273
- Okay, yeah.
- We need to go now.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.324
(rain pouring)

41:24.324 --> 41:25.157
Corin.
(Corin laughs)

41:25.157 --> 41:26.175
Corin.

41:26.175 --> 41:27.828
Corin, Corin!

41:27.828 --> 41:29.032
- What?
- Listen to me.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.971
Mom and dad have been
in an accident, okay?

41:31.971 --> 41:33.369
- What?

41:33.369 --> 41:37.576
- It's all right, they're fine,
but I need you to stay here.

41:37.576 --> 41:41.039
Be safe and I'm gonna go get Mom, okay?

41:41.039 --> 41:41.872
Just stay there.

41:43.217 --> 41:44.384
- Right, okay.

41:48.505 --> 41:50.089
- I, what do I say?

41:52.792 --> 41:55.271
- Okay, I told her.

41:55.271 --> 41:57.906
Can you get the car ready for me please?

41:57.906 --> 42:00.825
(thunder rumbling)

42:01.867 --> 42:04.286
I don't think we're safe her.

42:06.266 --> 42:07.600
I'll go get her.

42:11.819 --> 42:13.148
- Hope they're okay.

42:13.148 --> 42:17.516
- But in the mean time, we've
got the hot tub to ourselves.

42:19.707 --> 42:21.633
- I don't know, I feel like
I should go check on her.

42:21.633 --> 42:22.563
- Oh, it doesn't matter what's going on

42:22.563 --> 42:23.944
with your weird sister
right now, it's fine.

42:23.944 --> 42:25.206
- Don't call her weird.

42:25.206 --> 42:26.821
- She's causing a lot of drama tonight.

42:26.821 --> 42:28.337
- Yeah, well, she's been through a lot.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.814
You don't know half of it, okay?

42:29.814 --> 42:31.498
- Well, how would I know what's
going on with her, Corin?

42:31.498 --> 42:35.093
(thunder rumbling)

42:35.093 --> 42:36.382
- Paulie, get out.

42:36.382 --> 42:37.480
- It's just the lightning.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.153
- Paulie, that's getting close.

42:39.153 --> 42:40.892
Paulie, get out now.

42:40.892 --> 42:42.906
Paulie, get out of the tub, Paulie!

42:42.906 --> 42:47.910
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

42:50.022 --> 42:52.691
(Corin screams)

42:53.869 --> 42:58.874
(lightning crackling)
(suspenseful music)

43:00.488 --> 43:04.011
(water splashing)

43:04.011 --> 43:06.930
(thunder rumbling)

43:10.273 --> 43:14.109
(suspenseful music continues)

43:15.618 --> 43:16.451
- Hello?

43:20.202 --> 43:23.122
(thunder rumbling)

43:29.314 --> 43:32.598
(steps creaking softly)

43:32.598 --> 43:33.431
Hello?

43:37.647 --> 43:40.566
(thunder cracking)

43:42.172 --> 43:43.376
- Paulie?

43:43.376 --> 43:44.500
(Corin cries)

43:44.500 --> 43:45.648
- Paulie!

43:45.648 --> 43:47.728
- What is it?
- We're gonna die!

43:47.728 --> 43:49.004
We're all gonna die!

43:49.004 --> 43:50.402
- Corin, look at me, look at
me, look at me, look at me.

43:50.402 --> 43:52.282
It's okay, it's okay.
- Paulie!

43:52.282 --> 43:54.165
- No, you need to calm down.

43:54.165 --> 43:55.023
Calm down.

43:55.023 --> 43:56.158
Calm down, look at me.

43:56.158 --> 43:57.168
Calm down.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.454
Calm down, okay?

43:58.454 --> 43:59.884
Okay, it's gonna be all right.

43:59.884 --> 44:03.184
We're gonna make a plan,
we're gonna make a plan.

44:03.184 --> 44:05.599
(Corin whimpers)

44:05.599 --> 44:07.675
It's okay, it's okay.

44:07.675 --> 44:09.008
- [Sean] Go, go, go!

44:09.008 --> 44:09.926
Go, go, go!

44:11.469 --> 44:13.365
(suspenseful music continues)

44:13.365 --> 44:18.369
(thunder cracking)
(lightning striking)

44:21.092 --> 44:22.611
- Oh my God.

44:22.611 --> 44:24.645
- Right, this place is
gonna cave any second.

44:24.645 --> 44:27.282
(Corin whimpering)
(thunder rumbling)

44:27.282 --> 44:30.202
(ceiling cracking)

44:31.100 --> 44:32.207
- Okay.

44:32.207 --> 44:33.843
We gotta go.
- Yeah, yeah.

44:33.843 --> 44:34.937
- We gotta go.

44:34.937 --> 44:36.188
- Go.
- Come on.

44:37.077 --> 44:38.228
(suspenseful music)

44:38.228 --> 44:39.237
Come on, this way.

44:39.237 --> 44:41.156
(thunder cracking)

44:41.156 --> 44:42.123
- Wait.
- What?

44:42.123 --> 44:45.196
- I've noticed usually
before the ground strikes,

44:45.196 --> 44:46.881
which comes in flurries,

44:46.881 --> 44:49.926
there's some kind of
like build up lightning,

44:49.926 --> 44:51.247
all right, in the clouds.

44:51.247 --> 44:53.224
And it seems to build up
before it hits the ground.

44:53.224 --> 44:54.710
- Right, and you think
we've got a warning?

44:54.710 --> 44:55.761
(thunder cracking)

44:55.761 --> 44:59.116
- So that's like the last
surge has passed or something.

44:59.116 --> 45:00.975
- Well, literally it's clear over there.

45:00.975 --> 45:02.507
There's nothing in in
the clouds, let's go.

45:02.507 --> 45:03.948
- Oh, so we should go that way then.

45:03.948 --> 45:05.708
- Yeah, yeah, we're gonna
get your parents first.

45:05.708 --> 45:08.468
And then once we got
them, we get the fuck out

45:08.468 --> 45:09.778
of this danger zone, yeah?
- Okay, yeah.

45:09.778 --> 45:11.823
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go.

45:11.823 --> 45:14.682
(suspenseful music continues)

45:14.682 --> 45:16.148
- He's dead!

45:16.148 --> 45:18.286
He's dead, we've gotta get inside!

45:18.286 --> 45:19.531
- Sally!
- Sally, come here!

45:19.531 --> 45:20.824
- Get in the car!
- Sally, get in the car now!

45:20.824 --> 45:21.932
- Sally, get in the car!
- Sally!

45:21.932 --> 45:23.145
- Sally, come over here!

45:23.145 --> 45:25.755
Come over here!
(thunder cracking)

45:25.755 --> 45:28.674
(sparks crackling)

45:29.589 --> 45:30.693
(Corin screaming)

45:30.693 --> 45:32.977
- Sally, no!
- Sally!

45:32.977 --> 45:35.729
- We've gotta go, we've gotta go!

45:36.925 --> 45:37.759
- Sally.

45:39.848 --> 45:42.767
(thunder cracking)

45:45.089 --> 45:50.093
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

45:57.645 --> 46:00.564
(thunder cracking)

46:07.908 --> 46:09.571
- Any luck yet?

46:09.571 --> 46:12.498
- No, I can't get any signal.

46:12.498 --> 46:15.040
I'll try, no, I'll call the police after.

46:16.262 --> 46:17.876
It's just not working.

46:17.876 --> 46:22.881
- Oh my God, Sally! (cries)

46:22.964 --> 46:25.549
How can this be happening, Meg?

46:26.851 --> 46:28.435
- Paulie, was he...

46:29.302 --> 46:31.693
Paulie, was he definitely dead?

46:31.693 --> 46:34.195
(Corin cries)

46:37.314 --> 46:38.820
- Can you call his parents?

46:38.820 --> 46:39.654
Can you call his parents?

46:39.654 --> 46:41.589
After you call the police,
can you call his parents?

46:41.589 --> 46:43.115
They need to know!
- Okay.

46:43.115 --> 46:44.316
- No, they need to know!

46:49.171 --> 46:50.005
- Okay.

46:50.914 --> 46:53.833
(thunder rumbling)

46:54.746 --> 46:56.719
I can drive if you want me to.

46:56.719 --> 46:59.916
- No, no, I'm clear, I'm good.

46:59.916 --> 47:00.750
I'm good.

47:03.140 --> 47:04.168
(thunder rumbling)

47:04.168 --> 47:06.090
You know we're driving right
into the eye of this storm.

47:06.090 --> 47:07.852
- Yeah, I know, but we just
need to go and get my parents

47:07.852 --> 47:09.515
and just pick them up and then
we can get out of here, okay?

47:09.515 --> 47:10.837
Just focus on that.

47:12.417 --> 47:14.136
(thunder rumbling)

47:14.136 --> 47:16.809
- The storm's gotta be at
like 10 miles at least.

47:16.809 --> 47:18.338
I reckon we just, we just get them both,

47:18.338 --> 47:21.135
and we just get out the danger zone, okay?

47:22.243 --> 47:23.077
Yeah?

47:24.345 --> 47:26.867
- I heard reports last week,
and they said the lightning

47:26.867 --> 47:28.318
was knocking out electronics.

47:29.201 --> 47:32.815
Depending on the proximity,
it's working like an EMP.

47:36.025 --> 47:37.125
This is bullshit, man.

47:39.165 --> 47:42.225
(thunder rumbling)

47:42.225 --> 47:44.702
(prisoner groans)

47:44.702 --> 47:45.535
- Please help me.

47:45.535 --> 47:47.314
Can you please get me out of here?

47:47.314 --> 47:48.148
Okay.

47:50.872 --> 47:55.541
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

47:55.541 --> 47:57.015
- By Providence Divine,

47:57.973 --> 48:00.525
how on earth did you wind up in here?

48:00.525 --> 48:02.359
- Please, don't.

48:03.557 --> 48:05.689
- I should be pinched to death.

48:05.689 --> 48:07.100
- Put away the knife.

48:07.100 --> 48:08.902
- I have to be careful.

48:08.902 --> 48:11.544
I've already been attacked
by one intruder tonight.

48:11.544 --> 48:13.827
- He's lying, you're lying!

48:13.827 --> 48:18.360
(suspenseful music continues)

48:18.360 --> 48:21.936
- The lightning, we
have to get out of here.

48:22.960 --> 48:25.716
- Do you not want to
be struck by lightning?

48:25.716 --> 48:28.571
- My husband died in this tonight.

48:29.979 --> 48:33.552
- You really don't need to
worry about lightning anymore.

48:33.552 --> 48:34.924
- What, why?

48:34.924 --> 48:37.696
- I mean, you were trespassing.

48:37.696 --> 48:39.801
It was self-defense.

48:39.801 --> 48:42.560
(suspenseful music continues)

48:42.560 --> 48:45.630
- Run, get out of here, get out of here!

48:46.867 --> 48:48.775
- How didst thou escape?

48:48.775 --> 48:51.759
(thunder rumbling)

48:51.759 --> 48:55.595
(suspenseful music continues)

48:59.113 --> 49:02.032
(thunder cracking)

49:11.966 --> 49:14.647
I do smell of horse kiss.

49:20.264 --> 49:23.184
(thunder rumbling)

49:27.786 --> 49:32.790
(door creaking)
(thunder cracking)

49:38.497 --> 49:42.493
(suspenseful music continues)

49:42.493 --> 49:43.827
Oh, woe the day.

49:45.113 --> 49:48.471
(thunder cracking)

49:48.471 --> 49:53.475
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

50:11.840 --> 50:14.760
(prisoner panting)

50:17.333 --> 50:22.337
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

50:45.755 --> 50:46.743
(kidnapper grunts)
(prisoner groans)

50:46.743 --> 50:48.505
(kidnapper laughs)

50:48.505 --> 50:51.424
(kidnapper groans)

50:53.711 --> 50:55.099
(suspenseful music continues)

50:55.099 --> 50:55.933
Oh.

51:06.388 --> 51:07.927
- It's so weird.

51:07.927 --> 51:10.429
Like no one being on the road.

51:12.736 --> 51:14.828
- How did this happen?

51:14.828 --> 51:16.997
I mean, what's causing it?

51:18.270 --> 51:21.282
- Mother Nature fighting back.

51:21.282 --> 51:26.286
- Yeah, Dad mentioned this
story yesterday in the paper.

51:29.259 --> 51:30.210
- What's the story?

51:31.936 --> 51:35.414
- It was a theory about one of the storms,

51:35.414 --> 51:40.118
that the lightning tunes to the current

51:40.118 --> 51:41.669
of the human body or something.

51:43.971 --> 51:45.409
- That sounds impossible.

51:45.409 --> 51:47.034
- Yeah, people have been struck

51:47.034 --> 51:49.889
by lightning a lot more
recently, haven't they?

51:51.626 --> 51:53.627
- I mean, it's the second storm in days.

51:56.552 --> 51:57.686
What if this is our time?

51:58.984 --> 52:00.305
- It just felt a lot worse than what we've

52:00.305 --> 52:02.019
been experiencing until now.

52:03.251 --> 52:04.085
- I hope not.

52:05.349 --> 52:07.007
- Sorry about Paulie.

52:09.750 --> 52:11.601
- I should have got him out of there.

52:14.176 --> 52:16.368
Should have got him out of there.

52:16.368 --> 52:19.345
I should not, I should
have got him out of there.

52:19.345 --> 52:20.722
- [Corin] Sean.

52:20.722 --> 52:23.334
It was a freak of nature, all right?

52:23.334 --> 52:25.382
- No, I should, I should
have got him out of there!

52:25.382 --> 52:28.481
I should have got him out of there!

52:28.481 --> 52:29.480
(thunder rumbling)

52:29.480 --> 52:30.814
- Paulie's dead!

52:31.850 --> 52:34.936
(Corin cries softly)

52:36.633 --> 52:38.685
I don't think it's safe to drive anymore.

52:39.643 --> 52:41.806
We should...

52:41.806 --> 52:45.445
We should head out on
foot on the backfields.

52:48.420 --> 52:49.254
- Okay.

52:54.612 --> 52:59.616
(suspenseful music)
(thunder cracking)

53:04.781 --> 53:07.701
(prisoner panting)

53:10.574 --> 53:13.577
(prisoner groaning)

53:16.362 --> 53:21.366
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner panting)

53:22.835 --> 53:27.267
(kidnapper imitating animal hooting)

53:27.267 --> 53:30.353
(kidnapper laughing)

53:34.556 --> 53:38.089
(thunder rumbling)

53:38.089 --> 53:39.204
(suspenseful music continues)

53:39.204 --> 53:43.078
(kidnapper imitating animal hooting)

53:43.078 --> 53:46.942
(kidnapper laughing)

53:46.942 --> 53:51.946
(prisoner grunting)
(kidnapper groaning)

53:53.900 --> 53:57.177
(footsteps thudding)

53:57.177 --> 54:02.181
- Damn!
(hand thudding)

54:04.108 --> 54:09.112
(thunder rumbling)
(prisoner groaning)

54:11.638 --> 54:14.558
(prisoner panting)

54:21.291 --> 54:26.295
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder cracking)

54:31.928 --> 54:32.762
- Alas.

54:34.042 --> 54:36.127
The storm has come again.

54:42.507 --> 54:44.725
These are not natural events.

54:45.653 --> 54:48.598
They strengthen from strange to stranger.

54:51.084 --> 54:56.088
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

55:02.346 --> 55:03.761
All lost to prayers.

55:06.910 --> 55:08.293
To prayers all lost.

55:08.293 --> 55:11.379
(lightning striking)

55:21.765 --> 55:26.769
And so the elements we free! (laughs)

55:30.222 --> 55:35.226
(footsteps thudding)
(thunder rumbling)

55:38.955 --> 55:41.540
Let them all be hunted soundly.

55:43.564 --> 55:46.483
(thunder rumbling)

55:50.258 --> 55:53.428
(lightning crackling)

55:54.287 --> 55:57.206
(thunder cracking)

56:03.534 --> 56:06.204
(Corin panting)

56:08.303 --> 56:09.154
- No.

56:09.154 --> 56:10.996
It's the birds I think.

56:10.996 --> 56:13.915
(thunder rumbling)

56:18.670 --> 56:23.674
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

56:25.628 --> 56:26.652
(Corin cries)

56:26.652 --> 56:27.581
No.

56:27.581 --> 56:30.276
- What is it?
- Meg, just don't look, okay?

56:30.276 --> 56:32.557
- What is it, who is it?
- Just stay over there, okay?

56:32.557 --> 56:34.058
- What is it?
- No!

56:35.876 --> 56:39.713
(suspenseful music continues)

56:42.015 --> 56:42.848
He's dead!

56:43.693 --> 56:47.190
(sisters crying)

56:47.190 --> 56:48.710
- No.

56:48.710 --> 56:50.368
Mom.

56:50.368 --> 56:51.202
Mom?

56:51.202 --> 56:52.329
Mom!

56:52.329 --> 56:56.704
Mom, Mom! (cries)

56:56.704 --> 56:57.788
- Oh no, Dad.

56:59.405 --> 57:01.003
- Mom!

57:01.003 --> 57:04.924
Mom! (cries)

57:06.693 --> 57:07.527
Mom!

57:08.467 --> 57:09.904
No.
- Meg, Meg.

57:09.904 --> 57:12.140
- I need to find my mom.
- Meg!

57:12.140 --> 57:14.141
- I need to find my mom.

57:16.198 --> 57:17.369
She said...

57:17.369 --> 57:19.621
She said she was in a
house and they left her.

57:19.621 --> 57:22.106
She mustn't go out there,
she mustn't go out there.

57:22.106 --> 57:23.527
Something must have happened to her!

57:23.527 --> 57:24.361
- I know, I know.

57:24.361 --> 57:25.697
You said it sounded weird.

57:25.697 --> 57:26.977
But we just need to find the house

57:26.977 --> 57:28.865
and she might be in there.

57:28.865 --> 57:33.535
- Yeah, okay. (cries)

57:38.825 --> 57:41.744
(thunder cracking)

57:42.609 --> 57:46.195
(lightning striking)
- Meg!

57:49.983 --> 57:50.817
- Meg?

57:54.651 --> 57:56.283
Sean!

57:56.283 --> 57:58.982
(thunder cracking)

57:58.982 --> 58:03.986
Where are you? (whimpers)

58:08.533 --> 58:12.786
- You know you are not
going to get away with this.

58:13.944 --> 58:15.445
- Oh, the heavens.

58:16.937 --> 58:20.773
(suspenseful music continues)

58:26.913 --> 58:28.322
(Di groans)

58:28.322 --> 58:30.824
That's what all the girls say.

58:33.474 --> 58:35.809
(Di groans)

58:40.078 --> 58:42.997
(thunder cracking)

58:45.518 --> 58:48.604
(footsteps thudding)

58:50.219 --> 58:55.224
(thunder cracking)
(suspenseful music)

59:04.036 --> 59:05.611
(footsteps thudding)

59:05.611 --> 59:06.529
- Meg, Meg?

59:07.847 --> 59:09.515
Meg, oh my God, Meg.

59:10.657 --> 59:11.741
Are you okay?

59:12.597 --> 59:13.431
- Sean?

59:14.458 --> 59:16.143
Where's Sean?

59:16.143 --> 59:18.061
Where's Sean?

59:18.061 --> 59:18.894
Sean?

59:20.074 --> 59:21.944
- He didn't make it.

59:21.944 --> 59:23.541
- Sean?

59:23.541 --> 59:24.375
Sean!

59:26.431 --> 59:27.264
Sean.

59:28.330 --> 59:29.164
Sean!

59:31.162 --> 59:33.804
Sean! (cries)

59:33.804 --> 59:37.655
Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean, Sean.

59:37.655 --> 59:39.122
Sean, no!

59:39.122 --> 59:42.042
(thunder cracking)

59:45.079 --> 59:45.913
No.

59:48.878 --> 59:51.547
No, I can't see him!
- I'm sorry.

59:54.606 --> 59:59.552
- I can't do this anymore. (cries)

59:59.552 --> 1:00:01.554
I can't do this anymore!

1:00:02.840 --> 1:00:04.174
I can't, please!

1:00:05.456 --> 1:00:06.888
- It's okay, come here.

1:00:06.888 --> 1:00:09.923
- I can't do this anymore, I can't!

1:00:09.923 --> 1:00:14.927
No, I can't. (cries)

1:00:15.051 --> 1:00:19.955
(sisters crying)
(thunder rumbling)

1:00:19.955 --> 1:00:20.956
- It's okay.

1:00:24.656 --> 1:00:27.779
- I can't, I can't, I can't.

1:00:27.779 --> 1:00:29.998
(thunder rumbling)

1:00:29.998 --> 1:00:30.832
- Meg.

1:00:32.218 --> 1:00:33.330
Meg.

1:00:33.330 --> 1:00:34.226
- What?

1:00:34.226 --> 1:00:37.456
- We need, we need to go find the house.

1:00:37.456 --> 1:00:39.250
We need to go find Mom, okay?

1:00:40.809 --> 1:00:42.891
We're gonna go, we're gonna get Mom.

1:00:42.891 --> 1:00:43.925
- Okay.

1:00:43.925 --> 1:00:47.904
- And I need you, I need
you to be strong, okay?

1:00:47.904 --> 1:00:49.859
I need you with me, okay?

1:00:49.859 --> 1:00:51.027
- Okay.
- Yeah?

1:00:52.193 --> 1:00:53.562
Okay, let's go.

1:00:54.969 --> 1:00:55.970
Yeah?
- Okay.

1:00:58.845 --> 1:01:01.764
(sisters grunting)

1:01:02.734 --> 1:01:05.344
- That's it, that's it.

1:01:05.344 --> 1:01:07.989
(thunder rumbling)
(suspenseful music continues)

1:01:07.989 --> 1:01:09.713
Okay, look.

1:01:09.713 --> 1:01:12.645
That could be the house
that Mom was talking about.

1:01:12.645 --> 1:01:13.996
Yeah?

1:01:13.996 --> 1:01:15.958
That could be where Mom is.

1:01:15.958 --> 1:01:18.075
- Yeah.
- Yeah, come on.

1:01:18.075 --> 1:01:21.296
(twigs cracking)

1:01:21.296 --> 1:01:22.547
Come on.
- Yeah.

1:01:24.460 --> 1:01:28.566
- Okay. (panting)

1:01:28.566 --> 1:01:29.400
- No.

1:01:31.110 --> 1:01:32.281
- Hello?

1:01:32.281 --> 1:01:33.115
We need help.

1:01:33.115 --> 1:01:34.489
- No, no one's in.

1:01:34.489 --> 1:01:35.916
(hand knocking)

1:01:35.916 --> 1:01:38.919
(muffled screaming)

1:01:39.795 --> 1:01:40.961
No one's in.

1:01:40.961 --> 1:01:43.071
- We need to find the door.
- They could be gone.

1:01:43.071 --> 1:01:46.074
(muffled screaming)

1:01:47.837 --> 1:01:50.951
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder cracking)

1:01:50.951 --> 1:01:53.786
(shovel thudding)

1:01:57.713 --> 1:01:59.787
- She who dies pays all debts.

1:02:05.857 --> 1:02:08.777
(thunder cracking)

1:02:13.249 --> 1:02:16.792
(shovel thumping)

1:02:16.792 --> 1:02:21.797
(kidnapper laughing)
(thunder rumbling)

1:02:24.015 --> 1:02:26.146
- [Meg] We can't!

1:02:26.146 --> 1:02:27.587
- Look, we need shelter.

1:02:27.587 --> 1:02:29.061
And you need to be more warm.

1:02:29.061 --> 1:02:30.308
- Okay.
- All right?

1:02:30.308 --> 1:02:31.343
- Why don't you try again?

1:02:31.343 --> 1:02:33.511
Try the door.
- Okay, okay.

1:02:35.658 --> 1:02:37.993
- [Meg] Wait, there's a car.

1:02:38.884 --> 1:02:41.356
- All right, well if someone
comes back while we're

1:02:41.356 --> 1:02:42.840
in there then we'll just explain.

1:02:42.840 --> 1:02:43.711
- Okay.
- All right?

1:02:43.711 --> 1:02:45.262
- Just go, just go.
- Come on.

1:02:49.489 --> 1:02:52.158
(door creaking)

1:02:54.383 --> 1:02:55.217
- Hello?

1:02:56.402 --> 1:03:00.238
(suspenseful music continues)

1:03:06.082 --> 1:03:08.150
Hello?

1:03:08.150 --> 1:03:11.070
(muffled shouting)

1:03:12.390 --> 1:03:14.809
(Di panting)

1:03:18.648 --> 1:03:21.651
(muffled screaming)

1:03:23.020 --> 1:03:26.606
- We're looking for
shelter from the storm.

1:03:29.693 --> 1:03:32.510
(switch clicking)

1:03:32.510 --> 1:03:33.343
No power.

1:03:37.732 --> 1:03:38.650
- Let's go.

1:03:45.629 --> 1:03:48.631
(muffled screaming)

1:03:50.798 --> 1:03:52.693
What are you doing?

1:03:52.693 --> 1:03:54.995
- [Corin] Finding something
to do you up with.

1:04:03.237 --> 1:04:07.073
(suspenseful music continues)

1:04:09.905 --> 1:04:12.403
(zipper clattering)

1:04:12.403 --> 1:04:14.065
Okay, here we go.

1:04:14.065 --> 1:04:14.899
Sorry.

1:04:17.490 --> 1:04:19.158
That's a bit better.

1:04:20.138 --> 1:04:23.096
- Okay.
- Hey, it's magic healing.

1:04:23.096 --> 1:04:26.276
(both chuckling)

1:04:26.276 --> 1:04:27.661
- Yeah, when I was younger,

1:04:29.729 --> 1:04:33.633
the wounds always seemed
to heal like faster,

1:04:33.633 --> 1:04:35.511
you know, when Dad kissed them.

1:04:41.796 --> 1:04:43.848
And then when I got older and he stopped,

1:04:45.913 --> 1:04:50.917
like they just seemed to
hurt a bit more, do you know?

1:04:52.475 --> 1:04:53.309
- Yeah.

1:04:55.348 --> 1:04:56.181
Hey.

1:05:01.606 --> 1:05:03.007
I don't know how we do this.

1:05:04.191 --> 1:05:06.538
- The storm?

1:05:06.538 --> 1:05:09.040
- No, I mean, after the storm.

1:05:10.866 --> 1:05:13.100
I don't think I can.

1:05:13.100 --> 1:05:15.280
- You can.
- I mean

1:05:15.280 --> 1:05:17.339
like when the dust settles and...

1:05:18.428 --> 1:05:20.565
I just think it's gonna be even harder.

1:05:23.234 --> 1:05:25.509
The reality of what's happened and...

1:05:28.949 --> 1:05:30.450
How do we do this?

1:05:32.282 --> 1:05:33.200
- Together.

1:05:35.381 --> 1:05:36.215
Come here.

1:05:40.205 --> 1:05:41.123
- Love you.

1:05:43.783 --> 1:05:48.787
(bed creaking)
(Di panting)

1:05:50.236 --> 1:05:53.489
(bowl clanging loudly)

1:05:56.295 --> 1:05:57.129
Shit.

1:06:00.205 --> 1:06:01.706
- Something's off.

1:06:02.941 --> 1:06:04.164
- I don't know.

1:06:04.164 --> 1:06:07.047
(thunder rumbling)

1:06:07.047 --> 1:06:10.050
(muffled screaming)

1:06:12.886 --> 1:06:14.054
What the fuck?

1:06:16.894 --> 1:06:18.523
(mouth spitting)

1:06:18.523 --> 1:06:20.942
(Di panting)

1:06:32.691 --> 1:06:35.193
(Di groaning)

1:06:38.857 --> 1:06:41.276
(Di panting)

1:06:51.471 --> 1:06:52.305
Hello?

1:06:54.745 --> 1:06:57.414
(Corin panting)

1:07:03.256 --> 1:07:04.590
Is anyone there?

1:07:07.602 --> 1:07:09.505
- What do you think's happening?

1:07:09.505 --> 1:07:13.551
That he's like hurt or is
it like someone dangerous

1:07:13.551 --> 1:07:14.690
or something, I don't know.

1:07:14.690 --> 1:07:16.124
What should we do?

1:07:16.124 --> 1:07:17.865
- I bet it's locked.

1:07:17.865 --> 1:07:19.881
Should we go in?

1:07:19.881 --> 1:07:21.633
- I think we should go in.
- Yeah.

1:07:22.766 --> 1:07:24.772
- Jesus, Corin.
- What?

1:07:24.772 --> 1:07:25.806
- What?

1:07:25.806 --> 1:07:27.647
- I need to open it.

1:07:27.647 --> 1:07:29.044
Yeah?
- Yeah, okay.

1:07:29.044 --> 1:07:29.923
Go, go, go, go.

1:07:29.923 --> 1:07:32.676
Go, just go.
- All right, come on.

1:07:35.798 --> 1:07:37.300
- Yeah, go.
- Okay.

1:07:39.772 --> 1:07:43.196
(mallet bangs)
(lock thuds)

1:07:43.196 --> 1:07:44.279
- [Meg] Okay, go.

1:07:44.279 --> 1:07:45.447
- Mom?
- Girls!

1:07:46.756 --> 1:07:50.438
Just fucking help me!
- Oh my God, Mom!

1:07:50.438 --> 1:07:52.022
- Girls.
- Mom, Mom.

1:07:53.197 --> 1:07:54.980
- Get me out of here.
- Okay.

1:07:54.980 --> 1:07:57.415
- We need to get out
of here really quickly.

1:07:58.463 --> 1:08:01.976
The guy who owns this
place is fucking crazy.

1:08:01.976 --> 1:08:03.030
He kidnapped me.

1:08:04.452 --> 1:08:06.937
If he finds you here, he'll kill us all.

1:08:09.399 --> 1:08:11.524
- How long's he been gone?

1:08:11.524 --> 1:08:13.677
- Oh, I've got no idea.

1:08:13.677 --> 1:08:15.007
I heard him head out.

1:08:15.007 --> 1:08:16.358
I don't know where he is.

1:08:16.358 --> 1:08:18.342
- All right, well.
- Quick!

1:08:18.342 --> 1:08:19.360
- It's okay.

1:08:19.360 --> 1:08:21.432
People have been dying left and right.

1:08:21.432 --> 1:08:23.414
If he's out there, he
might have been struck.

1:08:23.414 --> 1:08:24.285
- Oh, I hope so.

1:08:24.285 --> 1:08:26.116
I want that bastard to die!

1:08:26.116 --> 1:08:26.950
- Yeah, we need to go.

1:08:26.950 --> 1:08:27.960
Please, just go.

1:08:27.960 --> 1:08:28.793
- I saw a knife.

1:08:28.793 --> 1:08:29.909
I'm gonna go and grab it, okay?

1:08:29.909 --> 1:08:31.655
I'll be back.

1:08:31.655 --> 1:08:33.172
- What happened?

1:08:33.172 --> 1:08:36.358
- There was another woman here before me.

1:08:40.413 --> 1:08:43.333
(thunder rumbling)

1:08:49.650 --> 1:08:54.654
(suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

1:09:07.635 --> 1:09:10.585
(door creaking)

1:09:10.585 --> 1:09:14.253
(door bangs softly)

1:09:14.253 --> 1:09:18.090
(suspenseful music continues)

1:09:24.947 --> 1:09:28.783
Then he said he was gonna
replace her with me.

1:09:29.649 --> 1:09:31.511
He grabbed me from behind.

1:09:31.511 --> 1:09:34.814
He put something over my
face, he knocked me out.

1:09:34.814 --> 1:09:36.465
And then I woke up tied up in this room!

1:09:36.465 --> 1:09:39.856
- Mom.
- Thank God you came!

1:09:39.856 --> 1:09:44.475
Oh God. (cries)

1:09:44.475 --> 1:09:46.140
- It's okay, Mom.

1:09:46.140 --> 1:09:46.974
It's okay.

1:09:49.441 --> 1:09:51.109
- After you, I know.

1:09:53.429 --> 1:09:56.522
He showed me some vile
and horrible pictures.

1:09:56.522 --> 1:09:58.166
- Of what?

1:09:58.166 --> 1:10:01.038
- Other girls, here before me.

1:10:01.038 --> 1:10:05.622
I recognized a couple
from posters around town.

1:10:08.351 --> 1:10:09.482
After your father...

1:10:10.974 --> 1:10:11.807
I...

1:10:15.017 --> 1:10:16.018
- We found his body.

1:10:17.719 --> 1:10:19.254
- I should have told you.

1:10:20.151 --> 1:10:22.496
I'm so sorry, Meg.

1:10:22.496 --> 1:10:23.497
- It's okay.

1:10:24.368 --> 1:10:26.369
- I just wanted to keep you safe.

1:10:27.730 --> 1:10:31.151
What happened with your
father was just all so sudden.

1:10:31.151 --> 1:10:34.154
(footsteps tapping)

1:10:40.508 --> 1:10:42.613
- He's here, quick, come on.

1:10:43.855 --> 1:10:45.142
- Please, come on quick, help me.

1:10:45.142 --> 1:10:46.906
- Let's go.
- Come on, Mom, Mom, Mom.

1:10:46.906 --> 1:10:48.456
Just come with me.

1:10:48.456 --> 1:10:52.292
(suspenseful music continues)

1:11:05.515 --> 1:11:06.683
- Shit.
- What?

1:11:07.785 --> 1:11:10.571
- I forgot my phone downstairs.

1:11:10.571 --> 1:11:14.408
(suspenseful music continues)

1:11:16.061 --> 1:11:17.709
- Mom, what are you doing?

1:11:17.709 --> 1:11:19.601
- I'll deal with him.
- No!

1:11:19.601 --> 1:11:20.982
- He doesn't know who you are.

1:11:20.982 --> 1:11:24.541
You need to get out now, both of you.

1:11:24.541 --> 1:11:26.543
- No, I think we should all go together.

1:11:27.918 --> 1:11:30.753
- We have to get through
him first, okay, yeah?

1:11:31.738 --> 1:11:32.572
- Oh!

1:11:34.338 --> 1:11:36.007
- Oh no, what do we?

1:11:37.257 --> 1:11:38.425
What do we do?

1:11:39.528 --> 1:11:41.987
Let's hide, let's hide.

1:11:41.987 --> 1:11:46.992
(suspenseful music continues)
(stairs creaking)

1:11:58.049 --> 1:11:59.614
(thunder rumbling)

1:11:59.614 --> 1:12:02.620
(lock rattles)

1:12:02.620 --> 1:12:05.289
(latch rattles)

1:12:10.597 --> 1:12:11.431
Okay.

1:12:12.921 --> 1:12:16.757
(suspenseful music continues)

1:12:22.633 --> 1:12:24.787
(Di grunts)
(kidnapper groans)

1:12:24.787 --> 1:12:25.705
- [Di] Run!

1:12:29.303 --> 1:12:32.222
(kidnapper coughs)

1:12:33.581 --> 1:12:36.765
(footsteps thudding)

1:12:36.765 --> 1:12:37.879
- Wait!

1:12:37.879 --> 1:12:39.865
We can't just leave her,
we can't just leave her.

1:12:39.865 --> 1:12:40.698
- Oh fuck!

1:12:42.687 --> 1:12:45.844
- Okay, wait, just stop, stop.

1:12:45.844 --> 1:12:47.694
We need to come right back.

1:12:47.694 --> 1:12:51.558
We need to find some way
to protect ourselves, okay?

1:12:51.558 --> 1:12:52.984
- Meg, Meg.

1:12:52.984 --> 1:12:54.152
- What?
- Look.

1:12:54.987 --> 1:12:57.609
The storm, it's coming back this way.

1:12:57.609 --> 1:12:58.536
Oh shit.

1:12:59.669 --> 1:13:01.098
(thunder cracking)

1:13:01.098 --> 1:13:04.306
(both gasping)

1:13:04.306 --> 1:13:07.792
- What do we do?

1:13:07.792 --> 1:13:10.473
(Di grunts)

1:13:10.473 --> 1:13:15.462
- Hostile spirit. (grunts)

1:13:15.462 --> 1:13:18.048
(mallet bangs)

1:13:19.227 --> 1:13:23.630
(kidnapper grunts)
(Di groans)

1:13:23.630 --> 1:13:25.548
(head butts)

1:13:25.548 --> 1:13:29.721
(suspenseful music continues)

1:13:29.721 --> 1:13:32.549
(footsteps thudding)

1:13:32.549 --> 1:13:34.720
It won't be so quick and painless for you.

1:13:35.968 --> 1:13:39.179
I shall flay each of you in turn.

1:13:39.179 --> 1:13:41.832
(both panting)

1:13:41.832 --> 1:13:43.083
- Oh fuck.
- Go!

1:13:48.169 --> 1:13:49.587
Quick, down here.

1:13:53.559 --> 1:13:58.563
(suspenseful music continues)
(kidnapper whistles)

1:14:04.335 --> 1:14:08.753
- If I knew I'd have
guests, I'd have cleaned.

1:14:08.753 --> 1:14:11.088
The spirit torments me, ugh!

1:14:12.472 --> 1:14:16.688
(suspenseful music continues)

1:14:16.688 --> 1:14:18.319
(floor creaking)

1:14:18.319 --> 1:14:21.290
(footsteps thudding)

1:14:21.290 --> 1:14:24.376
(kidnapper whistles)

1:14:35.154 --> 1:14:38.099
Hell is empty and all the devils are here.

1:14:41.989 --> 1:14:43.170
The hour has come.

1:14:45.963 --> 1:14:47.917
You know what I'm going to enjoy?

1:14:50.584 --> 1:14:54.160
Making you choose who dies first

1:14:54.160 --> 1:14:56.354
and who gets to watch the suffering.

1:14:57.823 --> 1:15:00.318
The god of thunder calls to me once again.

1:15:03.648 --> 1:15:05.452
Perhaps he wants a sacrifice.

1:15:06.409 --> 1:15:10.245
(suspenseful music continues)

1:15:21.753 --> 1:15:22.656
It's not enough.

1:15:24.725 --> 1:15:26.028
I'm going to need more blood!

1:15:26.028 --> 1:15:28.298
(Corin screams)

1:15:28.298 --> 1:15:29.804
- Go, go!

1:15:29.804 --> 1:15:33.641
(suspenseful music continues)

1:15:35.924 --> 1:15:37.396
Stay back.

1:15:37.396 --> 1:15:38.229
- No.

1:15:39.910 --> 1:15:41.489
(knife rattles)
- Ow.

1:15:41.489 --> 1:15:46.493
(kidnapper chuckles)
(Corine groans)

1:15:46.536 --> 1:15:47.866
(lips smacking)

1:15:47.866 --> 1:15:49.473
(kidnapper chuckling)
(head butting)

1:15:49.473 --> 1:15:52.225
(Corin groaning)

1:15:53.072 --> 1:15:54.298
(kidnapper grunts)

1:15:54.298 --> 1:15:56.286
(Meg grunts)
(shovel smacks)

1:15:56.286 --> 1:15:57.596
(kidnapper groans)

1:15:57.596 --> 1:15:59.577
(kidnapper mutters)

1:15:59.577 --> 1:16:01.636
- Hag's here, hence!

1:16:01.636 --> 1:16:02.880
(shovel thuds)

1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:05.299
(Meg groans)

1:16:09.072 --> 1:16:13.336
You're feisty, I like that! (chuckles)

1:16:14.285 --> 1:16:16.102
(lips smacking)

1:16:16.102 --> 1:16:18.474
(laughs) Give me thy hand.

1:16:18.474 --> 1:16:21.393
I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

1:16:22.294 --> 1:16:26.334
(Meg groans)
(kidnapper laughs)

1:16:26.334 --> 1:16:29.273
(kidnapper groans)

1:16:29.273 --> 1:16:31.203
(kidnapper coughs)

1:16:31.203 --> 1:16:35.039
(suspenseful music continues)

1:16:44.360 --> 1:16:49.365
(thunder rumbling)
(footsteps tapping)

1:16:51.086 --> 1:16:56.090
(kidnapper grunting)
(thunder cracking)

1:16:57.624 --> 1:17:00.209
(Meg whimpers)

1:17:03.616 --> 1:17:06.947
(thunder rumbling)

1:17:06.947 --> 1:17:10.783
(suspenseful music continues)

1:17:24.506 --> 1:17:27.468
(Corin groans)

1:17:27.468 --> 1:17:31.305
(suspenseful music continues)

1:17:52.202 --> 1:17:55.496
(Corin groans)

1:17:55.496 --> 1:18:00.500
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1:18:10.688 --> 1:18:12.132
- Mom?

1:18:12.132 --> 1:18:12.965
Mom, Mom!

1:18:14.133 --> 1:18:15.217
Are you okay?

1:18:17.827 --> 1:18:19.329
- Did you get him?

1:18:20.401 --> 1:18:21.318
- No, come.

1:18:22.713 --> 1:18:24.285
Get up for a sec.

1:18:24.285 --> 1:18:26.620
(Di groans)

1:18:29.528 --> 1:18:33.067
(thunder rumbling)

1:18:33.067 --> 1:18:34.151
That will do.

1:18:36.682 --> 1:18:41.686
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbling)

1:18:42.921 --> 1:18:45.590
(door rattling)

1:18:46.686 --> 1:18:49.772
(footsteps thudding)

1:18:54.932 --> 1:18:57.441
(footsteps thudding)

1:18:57.441 --> 1:18:59.943
(Meg panting)

1:19:03.377 --> 1:19:06.815
(suspenseful music continues)

1:19:06.815 --> 1:19:10.013
(loud banging)

1:19:10.013 --> 1:19:13.849
(suspenseful music continues)

1:19:25.856 --> 1:19:27.487
- Peek-a-boo, cherub!

1:19:30.031 --> 1:19:33.033
(kidnapper panting)

1:19:42.769 --> 1:19:46.170
(footsteps tapping)

1:19:46.170 --> 1:19:49.936
(suspenseful music continues)
(thunder rumbles)

1:19:49.936 --> 1:19:54.940
(footsteps tapping)
(sword scraping)

1:20:00.690 --> 1:20:03.442
(sword scraping)

1:20:05.360 --> 1:20:10.364
(thunder rumbles)
(suspenseful music continues)

1:20:22.982 --> 1:20:23.911
(door slams)

1:20:23.911 --> 1:20:27.136
(kidnapper laughs)
(Meg groans)

1:20:27.136 --> 1:20:31.376
(suspenseful music continues)

1:20:31.376 --> 1:20:33.795
Do you like that, cherub, hm?

1:20:39.335 --> 1:20:40.302
Aye?

1:20:40.302 --> 1:20:42.874
(Meg grunts)

1:20:42.874 --> 1:20:44.986
(suspenseful music continues)

1:20:44.986 --> 1:20:47.853
You got me good there, didn't you?

1:20:47.853 --> 1:20:50.188
Ah, move and I'll slice you.

1:20:51.476 --> 1:20:54.317
(Meg panting)

1:20:54.317 --> 1:20:57.375
You know, my first girl was a redhead.

1:20:59.144 --> 1:21:01.966
Can't have been more than a teenage girl.

1:21:01.966 --> 1:21:05.416
She squealed, she did. (laughs)

1:21:05.416 --> 1:21:06.953
She begged me to let her go.

1:21:08.145 --> 1:21:11.304
I told her she would just
be mine for the weekend,

1:21:11.304 --> 1:21:14.206
and then we'd have to
go back to her daddy.

1:21:15.300 --> 1:21:19.504
I fileted her from ear to
eat before the end of Sunday.

1:21:20.983 --> 1:21:22.369
(kidnapper laughs)

1:21:22.369 --> 1:21:25.258
(kidnapper groans)

1:21:25.258 --> 1:21:28.733
(corkscrew squelches)
(kidnapper screams)

1:21:28.733 --> 1:21:30.869
(mouth spits)

1:21:30.869 --> 1:21:34.627
(suspenseful music)
(thunder rumbling)

1:21:34.627 --> 1:21:35.461
- Meg.

1:21:38.320 --> 1:21:39.154
Meg?

1:21:40.350 --> 1:21:42.935
(wind howling)

1:21:43.964 --> 1:21:44.973
Meg.

1:21:44.973 --> 1:21:47.892
(thunder cracking)

1:21:49.676 --> 1:21:52.232
(suspenseful music continues)

(kidnapper groans)

1:21:54.559 --> 1:21:56.978
(Meg groans)

1:21:59.554 --> 1:22:02.474
(kidnapper laughs)

1:22:03.570 --> 1:22:07.407
(suspenseful music continues)

1:22:14.314 --> 1:22:19.319
- Oh, a Turk. (chuckles)

1:22:21.854 --> 1:22:24.773
(thunder cracking)

1:22:25.853 --> 1:22:29.709
(suspenseful music continues)

1:22:29.709 --> 1:22:32.412
Can you feel this energy?

1:22:32.412 --> 1:22:35.602
(thunder cracking)

1:22:35.602 --> 1:22:38.104
- You're crazy, you know that?

1:22:38.977 --> 1:22:42.580
- Crazy people have no
clue what they're doing.

1:22:43.418 --> 1:22:44.745
I'm perfectly sane.

1:22:46.423 --> 1:22:49.699
I just do whatever makes me feel alive.

1:22:50.799 --> 1:22:53.269
(wind howling)

1:22:53.269 --> 1:22:54.923
- You're a fucking psycho.

1:22:56.962 --> 1:22:59.937
- Good wombs have formed bad sons.

1:23:01.311 --> 1:23:03.951
- What, what?

1:23:04.812 --> 1:23:06.099
(thunder cracking)

1:23:06.099 --> 1:23:07.600
- Be brave, child.

1:23:08.952 --> 1:23:13.259
We'll see how brave you are
when you meet your maker.

1:23:14.887 --> 1:23:15.777
(thunder cracking)

1:23:15.777 --> 1:23:16.694
I grant it.

1:23:18.097 --> 1:23:19.014
Or he will.

1:23:20.880 --> 1:23:24.093
(thunder cracking)

1:23:24.093 --> 1:23:29.097

1:23:31.854 --> 1:23:35.117
(thunder cracking)

1:23:35.117 --> 1:23:35.950
- No.

1:23:37.538 --> 1:23:39.704
- You've bored me enough, girl.

1:23:39.704 --> 1:23:42.866
(Meg cries)

1:23:42.866 --> 1:23:45.318
(thunder cracking)

1:23:45.318 --> 1:23:47.073
- [Corin] No!

1:23:47.073 --> 1:23:50.909
(suspenseful music continues)

1:23:53.195 --> 1:23:54.363
- Time to die!

1:23:56.837 --> 1:23:59.922
(lightning striking)

1:24:06.320 --> 1:24:11.324

(sisters chattering)
(lightning striking)

1:24:34.754 --> 1:24:35.838
Mom, come on!

1:24:36.835 --> 1:24:37.669
That's it.

1:24:37.669 --> 1:24:39.357
Come on, we need to get out.

1:24:39.357 --> 1:24:41.706
(windows shattering)

1:24:41.706 --> 1:24:42.945
(Corin shouts)

1:24:42.945 --> 1:24:44.036
Come on, we need to go.

1:24:44.036 --> 1:24:46.528
We need to go now, come on.

1:24:46.528 --> 1:24:48.641
That's it, come on.

1:24:48.641 --> 1:24:49.663
Oh my god!

1:24:49.663 --> 1:24:51.378
All right, we need to get
out, it's coming down.

1:24:51.378 --> 1:24:52.212
Go!

1:24:54.172 --> 1:24:59.176
(lightning striking)
(windows shattering)

1:24:59.361 --> 1:25:02.280

1:25:18.964 --> 1:25:22.801
(suspenseful music continues)

1:25:24.418 --> 1:25:25.419
- It's over.

1:25:27.804 --> 1:25:28.888
- We made it.

1:25:29.861 --> 1:25:33.247
(Corin whimpers)

1:25:33.247 --> 1:25:35.738
- Let's go, let's go.

1:25:35.738 --> 1:25:37.340
- Come on.

1:25:37.340 --> 1:25:39.229
(thunder cracking)

1:25:39.229 --> 1:25:40.730
- Come on.
- Go on.

1:25:44.423 --> 1:25:47.342
(thunder rumbling)

1:25:56.492 --> 1:25:59.077
(somber music)

1:26:00.417 --> 1:26:03.419
(crickets chirping)

1:26:08.176 --> 1:26:10.136
Hi.
- Hey, there.

1:26:10.136 --> 1:26:11.554
- You okay?
- Yes.

1:26:13.266 --> 1:26:15.577
He would be so proud of you.

1:26:15.577 --> 1:26:18.373
Your courage that night and
what you did to save me.

1:26:20.081 --> 1:26:21.766
I have so much to thank you for.

1:26:23.264 --> 1:26:24.723
- [Corin] Meg?

1:26:24.723 --> 1:26:27.122
- Go on, go to your sister.

1:26:27.122 --> 1:26:29.298
- Okay, I love you.
- Love you.

1:26:29.298 --> 1:26:30.899
(lips smacking)

1:26:30.899 --> 1:26:33.902
(footsteps tapping)

1:26:37.671 --> 1:26:39.509
(Di sighs)

1:26:39.509 --> 1:26:42.512
(footsteps tapping)

1:26:43.454 --> 1:26:44.288
- What are you doing?

1:26:44.288 --> 1:26:47.224
- All right, so I've decided I'm gonna

1:26:47.224 --> 1:26:50.016
paint the ceiling in Dad's
study because it needs it.

1:26:50.016 --> 1:26:54.355
But I'm not sure whether
to use emulsion or gloss.

1:26:54.355 --> 1:26:56.036
- I don't know.

1:26:56.036 --> 1:26:57.312
(both laughing)

1:26:57.312 --> 1:27:00.661
- Well the WiFi's gone
so I can't look it up.

1:27:00.661 --> 1:27:02.747
- Oh, that's weird, I
thought the signal was back.

1:27:02.747 --> 1:27:05.599
- Yeah, it were, but it's gone again.

1:27:05.599 --> 1:27:07.304
Might be some like faulty
wiring or something.

1:27:07.304 --> 1:27:10.253
- Or have you even like
read the cons properly?

1:27:10.253 --> 1:27:11.182
'Cause you know what you're like.

1:27:11.182 --> 1:27:12.986
- Yeah, obviously, you dick.

1:27:12.986 --> 1:27:14.393
(Meg laughs)

1:27:14.393 --> 1:27:17.393
- You know, maybe emulsion or something.

1:27:17.393 --> 1:27:18.690
- Yeah.

1:27:18.690 --> 1:27:22.323
- Yeah 'cause I mean gloss is shiny.

1:27:22.323 --> 1:27:24.868
So do you want shiny walls?

1:27:25.918 --> 1:27:27.391
- Shiny!
- Shiny.

1:27:27.391 --> 1:27:29.079
- I'll pick up my brush and
I'll come help you, huh?

1:27:29.079 --> 1:27:30.790
- Okay, cool.

1:27:30.790 --> 1:27:33.550
Right, I'll go with this one then.

1:27:33.550 --> 1:27:35.444
- [Radio Announcer] Research
into the lightning storm,

1:27:35.444 --> 1:27:38.567
which struck a few months
ago is still ongoing.

1:27:38.567 --> 1:27:41.509
Dr. Becker addressed a summit
yesterday with his theory

1:27:41.509 --> 1:27:45.479
of electrical charge frequency
within these unique storms.

1:27:45.479 --> 1:27:49.713
"In the far north of Iceland,
in largely uninhabited areas,

1:27:49.713 --> 1:27:52.415
"these storms have been more frequent.

1:27:52.415 --> 1:27:55.778
"What my research has suggested
is that a particular charge

1:27:55.778 --> 1:27:59.471
"of lightning is drawn to
the small electrical charge

1:27:59.471 --> 1:28:01.363
"found within mammals.

1:28:01.363 --> 1:28:05.127
"Like most storms, the
striking points are random,

1:28:05.127 --> 1:28:07.338
"but during flurries of lightning,

1:28:07.338 --> 1:28:09.633
"the energy within the
storm begins to hone in

1:28:09.633 --> 1:28:12.442
"to particular striking points.

1:28:12.442 --> 1:28:15.324
"These can be satellites,
electricity pylons,

1:28:15.324 --> 1:28:17.696
"but as we have found, mammals too.

1:28:17.696 --> 1:28:21.029
"This would account for the
significant loss of life

1:28:21.029 --> 1:28:22.583
"in the last storm."

1:28:22.583 --> 1:28:25.400
Dr. Becker had correctly
predicted the last storm,

1:28:25.400 --> 1:28:28.097
the power of which was unprecedented,

1:28:28.097 --> 1:28:30.990
and which the weather service has denied.

1:28:30.990 --> 1:28:33.081
With a lightning storm due
to come across the East

1:28:33.081 --> 1:28:35.374
of England this afternoon and evening,

1:28:35.374 --> 1:28:37.566
Dr. Becker has made the same warning.

1:28:37.566 --> 1:28:38.597
We'll have more...

1:28:38.597 --> 1:28:39.668
(static buzzing)

1:28:39.668 --> 1:28:42.400
Office has issued an
only Amber alert so far.

1:28:42.400 --> 1:28:45.399
In other news, the Prime
Minister has come under...

1:28:45.399 --> 1:28:46.233
Again...
(static buzzing)

1:28:46.233 --> 1:28:48.400
His alleged ties to Russian Mafia.

1:28:48.400 --> 1:28:51.494
(static buzzing)

1:28:51.494 --> 1:28:56.370

1:28:56.370 --> 1:28:59.680
(wind howling)

1:28:59.680 --> 1:29:01.468
- It's back.

1:29:01.468 --> 1:29:06.472
(thunder cracking)
(wind howling)

1:29:08.789 --> 1:29:11.791
