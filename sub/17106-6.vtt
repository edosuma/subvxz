ANNOUNCER: Previously
on "Dance Academy"--

00:04.360 --> 00:05.839
-I'm always looking for
commercial dancers.

00:05.879 --> 00:07.040
Why don't you give me a call?

00:07.080 --> 00:08.519
-I'm really not a dancer.

00:08.560 --> 00:09.880
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN): You
should be really proud of how

00:09.919 --> 00:12.599
far you've come, which is why
I was so disappointed to

00:12.640 --> 00:14.800
receive this email
from your father.

00:14.839 --> 00:16.079
-Sorry?

00:16.120 --> 00:17.800
-It says, he's withdrawing
his financial support.

00:17.839 --> 00:19.239
-You could have any
career you wanted.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.399
Yeah, as long as it's
a cardiologist.

00:20.440 --> 00:21.800
DR. LIEBERMAN (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, nonsense.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.480
-Sammy, you can't support
yourself, pay your fees, and

00:23.519 --> 00:25.399
keep up your academy schedule.

00:25.440 --> 00:26.399
-You have to go to Berlin.

00:26.440 --> 00:29.320
-Maybe you could stay
with Ethan.

00:29.359 --> 00:30.480
-Seriously?

00:33.640 --> 00:34.479
-I loved it.

00:34.520 --> 00:36.359
-I love you.

00:36.399 --> 00:50.240
[theme song]

00:50.280 --> 00:53.240
Take a breath.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.200
Close your eyes.

00:56.240 --> 01:01.200
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:04.239 --> 01:06.599
This is my chance.

01:06.640 --> 01:11.599
This is my chance, my chance
to feel alive.

01:21.599 --> 01:28.519
[music playing]

01:28.560 --> 01:31.200
TARA (OFFSCREEN): When "Sleeping
Beauty" begins,

01:31.239 --> 01:33.200
Aurora's celebrating
her 16th birthday.

01:41.480 --> 01:45.319
By the time the curtain falls,
she's fallen in love with the

01:45.359 --> 01:54.159
prince, been bewitched by an
evil fairy, and woken again by

01:54.200 --> 01:55.359
the prince's kiss.

01:59.719 --> 02:03.159
KAT (OFFSCREEN): You have to
get on your hands and knees

02:03.200 --> 02:04.480
and clean behind the toilets.

02:04.519 --> 02:05.920
SAMUEL (OFFSCREEN):
It's disgusting.

02:05.959 --> 02:08.598
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Aurora's life
is like the perfect crush

02:08.639 --> 02:11.719
fantasy, that goes from first
glance to eternal love in the

02:11.759 --> 02:14.719
space of 90 minutes.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.479
-5:00 AM breakfast shifts
are just too cruel.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.680
-I feel like you're
aging prematurely.

02:20.719 --> 02:22.560
-You also have egg yolk
in your hair.

02:26.520 --> 02:29.439
TARA (OFFSCREEN): By the end
everything's so perfect that

02:29.479 --> 02:32.439
there's nothing left to do but
gaze into each other's eyes

02:32.479 --> 02:32.879
and murmur.

02:32.919 --> 02:35.719
Love you.

02:35.759 --> 02:38.400
-Uh yeah, back at ya.

02:38.439 --> 02:41.680
-It's like watching a car crash,
gruesome, yet, utterly

02:41.719 --> 02:43.199
compelling.

02:43.240 --> 02:45.400
-If I was betting that far out
of my league, I'd be shouting

02:45.439 --> 02:46.520
it from the rooftops too.

02:46.560 --> 02:51.319
[giggling]

02:51.360 --> 02:53.240
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Maybe it's
whatever comes after the

02:53.280 --> 02:57.199
happily ever after that's
the real challenge.

02:57.240 --> 03:00.240
-And then there were two.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.560
-Come on, Kat.

03:01.599 --> 03:02.719
Wasn't your excuse for
monopolizing the shower that

03:02.759 --> 03:04.639
you had to be at
school on time?

03:04.680 --> 03:06.159
-And I'm going, right now.

03:06.199 --> 03:09.599
See, legs moving very fast.

03:09.639 --> 03:12.800
Signing up for another day of
bum numbing in classroom.

03:12.840 --> 03:15.479
-A sedentary lifestyle can
lead to severe boredom.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.520
We should go to the beach.

03:17.560 --> 03:21.599
Don't you have some scheduled
event for the day, like class?

03:21.639 --> 03:23.719
-Yeah, excused, doctor's
appointment.

03:23.759 --> 03:26.800
But Kat, look, our youth
will pass us by, if we

03:26.840 --> 03:28.199
don't seize the day.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.199
-So it's for the brochure
and website.

03:33.240 --> 03:33.960
-Oh, OK.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.560
-You should get on of us.

03:35.599 --> 03:38.280
I'm kidding.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.759
-So um that public declaration,
which I totally

03:41.800 --> 03:43.840
didn't mean to be so loud.

03:43.879 --> 03:46.479
Did I embarrass you or--

03:46.520 --> 03:48.520
-It was loud.

03:48.560 --> 03:52.159
I have a well-developed
embarrassment threshold.

03:52.199 --> 03:53.360
-That's lucky.

03:59.680 --> 04:02.400
-Try to ignore Danny, guys.

04:02.439 --> 04:05.199
The uh dancing will look much
better, if you're not posing

04:05.240 --> 04:06.199
shamelessly for the camera.

04:06.240 --> 04:07.599
-I don't know where Ben is.

04:07.639 --> 04:10.199
Do you think I could take turns
with Abigail and work

04:10.240 --> 04:11.400
with Christian?

04:11.439 --> 04:13.599
Mm, you're a little too
tall for him, sweetie.

04:13.639 --> 04:14.840
-Auroras, hold those
attitudes.

04:14.879 --> 04:16.079
-Sammy, wake up, yeah.

04:16.120 --> 04:17.800
You're luck you've got such
a strong partner.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.279
Everyone check out Grace.

04:19.319 --> 04:21.199
She how her energy's running
straight up through her center

04:21.240 --> 04:24.160
of balance?

04:24.199 --> 04:25.360
Lovely.

04:31.560 --> 04:34.160
OK, guys, Danny needs a
beautiful couple for the front

04:34.199 --> 04:36.120
cover of the academy brochure.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.800
Christian, can I get
you down here?

04:37.839 --> 04:38.720
-He's so dreamy.

04:38.759 --> 04:40.240
[all laughing]

04:40.279 --> 04:41.600
Love you.

04:41.639 --> 04:44.639
-And Grace, come on down.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.600
You two are a great couple.

04:46.639 --> 04:49.120
You look really good together.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.439
-Should we try the attitude
position?

04:59.160 --> 05:00.800
-Hey I vote we go
to the aquarium.

05:00.839 --> 05:02.360
I know the sharks.

05:02.399 --> 05:04.639
KAT (OFFSCREEN):
I hate sharks.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.040
Ta-da.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.160
-I love you as me.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.399
-Uh thanks.

05:17.279 --> 05:18.600
-Who's Anne Black?

05:22.879 --> 05:25.319
-She's just some dodgy agent
I met at showcase.

05:25.360 --> 05:26.360
She wanted to meet with me.

05:26.399 --> 05:27.240
-But that's awesome.

05:27.279 --> 05:28.720
You should ring here.

05:28.759 --> 05:31.759
-I be she gives her card to
every blonde who can do a time

05:31.800 --> 05:32.879
step.

05:32.920 --> 05:37.360
-It's the agent or the
sharks, your pick.

05:37.399 --> 05:42.160
Six, seven, eight, soutenu
and lunge.

05:45.439 --> 05:51.480
Arabesque, stabilize,
and fish dive.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.759
Uh let's try that one again.

05:52.800 --> 05:53.839
Shall we, Sammy?

05:53.879 --> 05:54.879
-Please be careful.

05:54.920 --> 05:57.399
My unbroken bones are
very dear to me.

05:57.439 --> 06:00.199
-Seems you're missing a few life
sustaining activities.

06:00.240 --> 06:01.720
Eating and sleeping may
seem irrelevant.

06:01.759 --> 06:04.800
But uh body strength is
kind of important.

06:04.839 --> 06:07.759
All you guys should be hitting
the gym in your spare time.

06:07.800 --> 06:11.480
-Spare time-- yeah, I
remember spare time.

06:11.519 --> 06:13.800
-You need total body strength
for these lifts, yeah.

06:22.879 --> 06:24.839
-Ari.

06:24.879 --> 06:26.519
-Aren't the guy ballerinas
meant to lift the girl

06:26.560 --> 06:28.199
ballerinas?

06:28.240 --> 06:31.600
-Does Mom and Dad know
you're here?

06:31.639 --> 06:32.800
What happened to your face?

06:32.839 --> 06:34.600
You get hit with
a hockey ball?

06:34.639 --> 06:35.600
-He hasn't visited.

06:35.639 --> 06:36.399
He hasn't called.

06:36.439 --> 06:38.319
Now, he sees a tiny scratch.

06:38.360 --> 06:40.720
Maybe I should get beat
up more often.

06:40.759 --> 06:42.480
-Whoa, someone beat you up?

06:42.519 --> 06:43.560
-Uh it's not big deal.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.040
-No, come on.

06:45.079 --> 06:48.240
Where do I find this dirt bag,
the bus stop, hockey fields?

06:48.279 --> 06:49.439
Is he on your team?

06:49.480 --> 06:50.680
-He's a mathlete.

06:50.720 --> 06:52.079
-Bully nerd--

06:52.120 --> 06:54.240
must be a new species.

06:54.279 --> 06:55.839
What are you going to
do, dance with him?

06:55.879 --> 06:57.680
-Hey, I can be intimidating.

06:57.720 --> 07:00.519
Never underestimate the guns.

07:00.560 --> 07:03.639
-It wasn't even much
of a fight.

07:03.680 --> 07:05.800
I just wanted to hang
out with you.

07:14.519 --> 07:16.600
-Grace is really pretty,
isn't she?

07:16.639 --> 07:19.600
-Yeah, she's all right.

07:19.639 --> 07:23.199
-She has really good bones.

07:23.240 --> 07:25.600
-But too skinny for me.

07:25.639 --> 07:28.759
-I guess I'm not too
skinny for you.

07:28.800 --> 07:31.079
-No.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.439
-I guess I'm other things.

07:34.480 --> 07:36.199
-Yeah, you're--

07:36.240 --> 07:38.240
you're kind of odd and chirpy.

07:38.279 --> 07:39.120
-Chirpy--

07:39.160 --> 07:40.199
I'm odd, and I'm chirpy.

07:40.240 --> 07:42.439
That's what you love about me.

07:42.480 --> 07:45.560
-Aren't you hungry?

07:45.600 --> 07:46.839
All right.

07:46.879 --> 07:51.319
Well, I need to finish my
Anatomy homework now.

07:55.639 --> 07:58.439
-There's nothing else you
might like to say to me?

07:58.480 --> 08:00.279
-Can you put that in
the bin for me?

08:00.319 --> 08:01.600
Thanks, and this.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.800
-See, not at all dodgy.

08:10.839 --> 08:12.800
Wow.

08:12.839 --> 08:14.399
-Katrina.

08:14.439 --> 08:16.319
-Uh, Ben Tickle, her manager.

08:16.360 --> 08:18.560
-My friend, who needs
managing.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.439
-Well, Mr. Tickle, your client
and I need some alone time.

08:25.480 --> 08:27.160
You've got five seconds.

08:27.199 --> 08:27.680
-What?

08:27.720 --> 08:29.360
Oh, uh--

08:29.399 --> 08:30.319
I'm Katrina.

08:30.360 --> 08:31.720
But that my friends
call me Kat.

08:31.759 --> 08:34.240
Uh and I just thought-- no,
my friend Ben out there--

08:34.279 --> 08:35.759
-Bzzt.

08:35.799 --> 08:38.080
That is how long a casting
director will give you.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.480
So you've got to know
who you are.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.360
You've go to know how to
walk through the door.

08:41.399 --> 08:42.320
You're your own business now.

08:42.360 --> 08:44.200
You're Katrina Karamakov.

08:44.240 --> 08:45.639
-I am?

08:45.679 --> 08:47.320
-But you need to want this,
because when I believe in an

08:47.360 --> 08:48.360
artist [phone ringing]

08:48.399 --> 08:49.320
more than they believe
themselves.

08:49.360 --> 08:50.759
Well, that hurts, Kat.

08:50.799 --> 08:52.200
-Uh, I'm sorry.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.360
-Donna, can you hold for three?

08:53.399 --> 08:54.080
Thanks.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.120
All right.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.799
We've got an audition
this afternoon.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.360
So this could be the start of
a very special and lucrative

08:59.399 --> 09:00.600
bond between us.

09:00.639 --> 09:01.440
-All righty.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.519
Uh what's it for?

09:04.559 --> 09:05.559
-No, I told you.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.159
We're not going to sign
that contract.

09:07.200 --> 09:08.360
Well, I want per diems.

09:08.399 --> 09:09.639
I want business class travel.

09:09.679 --> 09:10.559
And I want one of
those miniature

09:10.600 --> 09:12.279
horses in the trailer.

09:12.320 --> 09:14.360
Well, how badly do
you want her?

09:32.200 --> 09:35.360
-No, Mom, he just showed up.

09:35.399 --> 09:39.000
Well, maybe he could
stay the night.

09:39.039 --> 09:42.440
Well, he said the fight
wasn't serious.

09:42.480 --> 09:44.120
I didn't know that.

09:47.799 --> 09:51.159
No, he didn't mention
that part.

09:51.200 --> 09:52.080
Yeah, OK.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.559
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.399
And he's fine now.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.600
OK, bye.

09:59.480 --> 10:01.279
Apparently, you been bullying
other kids.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.799
They had to see the principle
about it.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.200
-Bullying is such an
overused term.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.440
-So you're one of those guys
now, the ones who used to

10:08.480 --> 10:10.440
throw my bag into the creek
for being a dancer.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.559
-As if you know what's
been going on.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.120
You haven't been home for
the past six months.

10:15.159 --> 10:16.320
And I don't even know why.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.039
-Get off for a sec.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.399
Dad refused to pay
my Academy fees.

10:34.440 --> 10:38.039
He was hoping I'd run back home,
penniless and needy.

10:38.080 --> 10:38.799
So I got a job.

10:38.840 --> 10:41.639
And I didn't go back home.

10:41.679 --> 10:45.720
Your turn, start talking.

10:45.759 --> 10:49.279
-If you get a six pack, you're
still ballerina boy.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.159
It's not cooler.

10:51.200 --> 10:52.399
-It is a bit cooler.

10:57.799 --> 11:01.120
-Huh, say it with me.

11:01.159 --> 11:02.320
Awesome.

11:04.200 --> 11:04.679
-OK.

11:04.720 --> 11:05.440
Can we go now?

11:05.480 --> 11:08.240
Because that's unsettling.

11:08.279 --> 11:09.559
-No, we can't go.

11:09.600 --> 11:12.360
That'd be against everything
I stand for.

11:12.399 --> 11:15.559
-So you stand for girls in tight
outfits and fluorescent

11:15.600 --> 11:16.080
teeth?

11:16.120 --> 11:16.759
-Yes.

11:16.799 --> 11:19.200
Yes I do.

11:19.240 --> 11:23.279
-Are we auditioning for the
Emu cheer squad today?

11:23.320 --> 11:24.480
OK.

11:24.519 --> 11:27.480
So we're looking at flexibility,
dance ability,

11:27.519 --> 11:29.759
crowd ability, personalibility.

11:29.799 --> 11:31.279
I mean, personality.

11:31.320 --> 11:35.080
And I want to see sunshine
beams on all those faces.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.120
OK.

11:36.159 --> 11:39.039
Let's get ready for the
first position.

11:39.080 --> 11:45.360
OK, big cinnamon rolls, high V,
left herkie, and toe-touch,

11:45.399 --> 11:47.759
high V, right herkie.

11:47.799 --> 11:49.279
Let's do it all again.

11:49.320 --> 11:54.200
Cinnamon roll, high V, left
herkie, and toe-touch--

11:54.240 --> 11:55.600
BEN (OFFSCREEN): Toe-touch.

11:55.639 --> 11:57.159
-Oh, wow.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.279
Your friend's picking
it up super fast.

12:00.320 --> 12:03.200
-High V, left herkie.

12:03.240 --> 12:05.559
-You have to stay bouncy, even
when your team's losing.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.399
And with the Emus, that
happens a lot.

12:08.440 --> 12:11.360
I didn't say that.

12:11.399 --> 12:21.399
[music playing]

12:21.440 --> 12:30.279
[music playing]

12:30.320 --> 12:31.720
-OK.

12:31.759 --> 12:34.159
So the girls I call need to come
and collect a uniform for

12:34.200 --> 12:36.519
call backs tomorrow.

12:36.559 --> 12:41.600
Ashley Tamara, Peaches Delight,
Kat Karamakov.

12:46.799 --> 12:49.159
-Five minutes living together
and already I

12:49.200 --> 12:51.559
have to play the parent.

12:51.600 --> 12:52.600
Your school rang me today.

12:52.639 --> 12:54.720
-Oh, well, I gave myself
an excursion.

12:54.759 --> 12:58.360
-Purely educational, she's now
master of the left herkie.

12:58.399 --> 13:00.679
-Yeah.

13:00.720 --> 13:05.279
Look, it was just a one-off, a
vitally important audition.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.080
-For what?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.279
-For the Emus.

13:09.320 --> 13:10.559
Cheerleading is a lot harder
than you think.

13:10.600 --> 13:11.759
OK, here.

13:15.039 --> 13:17.480
-I though you wanted to make
a go of normal school.

13:17.519 --> 13:18.600
-I did, I do.

13:18.639 --> 13:23.080
Um it's just maybe this
could be my thing.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.559
-Cheerleading?

13:24.600 --> 13:25.440
-You're a snob.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.080
-Yeah.

13:26.120 --> 13:26.519
Well, you know what?

13:26.559 --> 13:27.399
I am.

13:27.440 --> 13:28.759
You gave up the National
Academy.

13:28.799 --> 13:31.159
-I got kicked out of the
National Academy.

13:31.200 --> 13:33.039
-So you could do cartwheels
for a sport

13:33.080 --> 13:33.799
you don't even like.

13:33.840 --> 13:34.759
Come on, Kat.

13:34.799 --> 13:37.759
It's just another distraction.

13:37.799 --> 13:40.200
Well, I told the school you're
really looking forward to that

13:40.240 --> 13:40.639
detention.

13:40.679 --> 13:42.639
-Awesome.

13:42.679 --> 13:44.000
-I thought we're going
to watch a DVD.

13:46.720 --> 13:47.879
Can't you call in sick?

13:47.919 --> 13:49.559
-I could, but then I couldn't
afford to eat.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.159
-Probably want to watch
"Step Up 4" anyway.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.799
[scoffing]

13:55.840 --> 13:57.200
-I'll just hang out here.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.279
-You really don't want to be
home right now, do you?

14:02.320 --> 14:03.480
Well, I can't leave you here.

14:03.519 --> 14:08.240
You might beat up on some
poor defenseless--

14:08.279 --> 14:11.120
Abigail, did I mention how
exceptional your pirouettes

14:11.159 --> 14:13.200
were today?

14:13.240 --> 14:14.759
-For best results,
exfoliate first.

14:14.799 --> 14:17.759
I recommend two shades darker
than your natural tan, a

14:17.799 --> 14:18.200
wholesome glow.

14:18.240 --> 14:19.399
And it's--

14:19.440 --> 14:21.799
it's nicely slimming.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.639
Not that you aren't
slim already.

14:23.679 --> 14:24.919
-Thanks, Ben.

14:24.960 --> 14:27.000
-I can help you with the
application, if you like.

14:27.039 --> 14:28.799
-A selfless offer, but no.

14:35.039 --> 14:36.240
-Did he say, slimming?

14:40.120 --> 14:42.159
-I guess you're not a gamer.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.120
-I have no idea what
that means.

14:44.159 --> 14:47.240
But I like activities with
rules and outcome and an

14:47.279 --> 14:48.440
undisputed winner.

14:51.639 --> 14:52.799
-Welcome to the world
of gaming.

14:57.600 --> 15:01.279
-Who knew having gigantic fists
and smashing everything

15:01.320 --> 15:02.480
in sight could be
so liberating?

15:02.519 --> 15:04.240
-It officially owns ballet.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.600
No offense.

15:06.639 --> 15:12.360
-Ballet is more pain and
violence and sacrifice than

15:12.399 --> 15:14.600
you'll ever know, kid.

15:14.639 --> 15:16.159
-So why do you do it?

15:16.200 --> 15:19.120
-Because if I didn't,
I wouldn't be me.

15:19.159 --> 15:20.320
Neither would your brother.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.279
Ooh, and suck it.

15:26.320 --> 15:28.559
-The problem is,
I'm only a C+.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.159
-Oh, any topic but school,
thank you.

15:31.200 --> 15:32.159
I mean physically.

15:32.200 --> 15:33.639
Christian's an A or an A+.

15:33.679 --> 15:37.759
And I'm only a C or a C-,
on a bad skin day.

15:37.799 --> 15:40.120
-Uh, it says that, you should
spray that about 30

15:40.159 --> 15:41.559
centimeters away
from your skin.

15:41.600 --> 15:42.759
-Do you think that Christian
know that he could do better

15:42.799 --> 15:46.039
than me, because I'm not
pretty enough for him?

15:46.080 --> 15:50.080
-I think you should spay that
thing further away.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.480
-I would give anything to
look like you or Grace.

15:52.519 --> 15:56.120
There's just-- there's just
so much wrong with me.

15:56.159 --> 15:59.279
-Yeah, like you don't have
a great boyfriend.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.440
You have no idea what you want
to do with your life.

16:01.480 --> 16:03.440
And you're completely
untalented.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.679
You mean those kind of things?

16:05.720 --> 16:08.440
Has it ever occurred to you,
maybe you don't always need

16:08.480 --> 16:10.320
something to work on?

16:10.360 --> 16:14.559
-There's always something
that needs working on.

16:17.519 --> 16:18.240
-Thanks.

16:18.279 --> 16:19.279
-Don't try that again.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.320
-So you work this
much every day?

16:28.799 --> 16:30.759
-We can still do a
DVD, if you want.

16:34.559 --> 16:40.360
-The mathlete, he took my place
on the hockey team.

16:40.399 --> 16:43.159
-You go thrown of
the hockey team?

16:43.200 --> 16:48.440
-I get math tutoring instead,
Dad's orders.

16:48.480 --> 16:51.279
Since you left, all he
does is hassle me.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.639
One of my sons will
become a doctor.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.360
-I never thought that he'd
put all that on you.

16:59.399 --> 17:01.679
-I keep thinking it would be
better if you came home.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.600
But you can't.

17:03.639 --> 17:07.160
Can you?

17:07.200 --> 17:08.400
-I'm really sorry, mate.

17:21.160 --> 17:22.519
-(EXCITEDLY) I'm tan!

17:22.559 --> 17:23.480
I'm tan!

17:23.519 --> 17:24.440
I'm tan!

17:24.480 --> 17:25.440
I'm tan!

17:25.480 --> 17:26.440
I'm tan!

17:26.480 --> 17:36.640
[screaming]

17:36.680 --> 17:38.039
-Oompa Loompa chic.

17:43.200 --> 17:44.359
MISS RAINE (OFFSCREEN):
Sweetie, what

17:44.400 --> 17:46.119
have you done to yourself?

17:54.839 --> 17:56.039
-I said, two shades.

17:56.079 --> 17:59.119
I hope Kat's not looking
like this.

17:59.160 --> 18:03.599
-So that embarrassment
threshold, I've exceeded it?

18:03.640 --> 18:04.799
-Yeah, a little bit.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.039
-OK, guys, we're going to
work through the fish

18:11.079 --> 18:12.519
dive sequence again.

18:12.559 --> 18:15.559
And uh speaking for the girls
in the room, I hope you boys

18:15.599 --> 18:17.759
have had your spinach
this morning.

18:17.799 --> 18:27.759
[music playing]

18:27.799 --> 18:29.119
-And go.

18:45.480 --> 18:53.160
Hold the arabesque, stabilize,
and fish.

18:56.599 --> 18:57.680
-Tell me I'm brilliant.

18:57.720 --> 19:01.000
-By all means, Sammy,
you're brilliant.

19:04.319 --> 19:05.519
-Nice, Sammy, much improved.

19:08.359 --> 19:09.599
-Can I help you?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.359
-I'm here to collect my son.

19:16.079 --> 19:17.279
-Let me be completely clear.

19:17.319 --> 19:18.759
This is not happening again.

19:18.799 --> 19:20.599
-Cause fun's not allowed in
the Lieberman family.

19:20.640 --> 19:21.880
-You see the effect
you have on him?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.319
-Yeah, I'm sure he got the
bullying from me too.

19:24.359 --> 19:26.079
-Dad, I know you hate the
choices I've made.

19:26.119 --> 19:27.319
But do you have to
hate his as well?

19:27.359 --> 19:29.000
-I'm not having this discussion
with you.

19:29.039 --> 19:30.440
-He's just a kid.

19:30.480 --> 19:31.880
Let him play hockey.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.079
I mean, I really don't think
you ought to push him away.

19:34.119 --> 19:35.279
-You look tired.

19:35.319 --> 19:36.599
Are you eating properly?

19:36.640 --> 19:38.000
-Yeah.

19:44.559 --> 19:47.119
-That was a pretty awesome
fish dive thing.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.599
-Hey, come over next week,
OK, games and pizza.

19:51.640 --> 19:52.799
-OK.

20:06.519 --> 20:07.839
-Katrina.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.440
-Sorry, uh I didn't think you'd
be here on a Saturday.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.079
I just thought that you could
return this to the squad.

20:14.119 --> 20:16.319
-You have to recall
in 28 minutes.

20:16.359 --> 20:19.319
And no, I don't courier
whilst wearing Prada.

20:19.359 --> 20:21.119
-I can't go back there.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.079
I don't care about rugby.

20:22.119 --> 20:24.559
-Do you think I care
about rugby?

20:24.599 --> 20:26.680
-Look my friend Ben
dragged me here.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.440
-You dragged yourself here.

20:28.480 --> 20:31.440
Something in you made you
perform at showcase, the same

20:31.480 --> 20:32.640
that made you audition
yesterday.

20:36.319 --> 20:37.279
-I--

20:37.319 --> 20:41.240
I think I miss it, dancing.

20:41.279 --> 20:43.519
My legs feel weird without it.

20:43.559 --> 20:45.240
-So you are a dancer.

20:45.279 --> 20:47.960
What, are you afraid of
not being good enough.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.160
Is that it?

20:51.720 --> 20:52.920
-Yeah.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.400
-Then just don't think about
what happens next.

20:54.440 --> 20:56.960
You just see this audition and
every other-- because there

20:57.000 --> 20:59.480
will be others-- as
a chance to dance.

20:59.519 --> 21:01.519
Doesn't matter whether it's for
a ballet company or to be

21:01.559 --> 21:03.160
a cheerleader.

21:03.200 --> 21:05.279
You dance because
you're a dancer.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.960
TARA (OFFSCREEN): When I first
started ballet, I didn't know

21:13.000 --> 21:15.400
my Achilles were tight or that
my back had a slight arch.

21:19.039 --> 21:21.240
After awhile, you're told so
many things are wrong with

21:21.279 --> 21:24.680
you, all you can see are
the imperfections.

21:24.720 --> 21:26.960
-OK, Kat, you're up next.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.519
Show me your best moves.

21:28.559 --> 21:33.400
And I really want to see
that sunshine beam.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.519
TARA (OFFSCREEN): Sleeping
beauty just needed to kiss to

21:35.559 --> 21:36.279
solve everything.

21:36.319 --> 21:40.599
But that's a fairy tale.

21:40.640 --> 21:44.359
I have to do it myself, go
back to the beginning and

21:44.400 --> 21:46.720
remember why I danced
in the first place.

21:46.759 --> 21:56.720
[music playing]

21:56.759 --> 22:06.759
[music playing]

[music playing]

22:27.000 --> 22:39.079
[music playing]

22:39.119 --> 22:40.599
-I would chant for
the Emus no more.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.960
-Yeah, I was even going to
take Ari to the game.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
-Ah, so I'm not a cheerleader.

22:45.039 --> 22:46.559
I'm still going to keep
auditioning thought, till I

22:46.599 --> 22:49.079
find something that fits.

22:49.119 --> 22:50.279
-Let's walk.

22:57.559 --> 22:59.319
-You know I think you're
pretty, right?

22:59.359 --> 23:01.079
-Yeah, this tan really
suits me.

23:01.119 --> 23:02.480
I think I might make
it my new look.

23:06.119 --> 23:09.400
I might have had a
small freak out.

23:09.440 --> 23:11.079
-You were fine.

23:11.119 --> 23:12.960
And then your head
just went all--

23:13.000 --> 23:13.720
I don't know.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.160
-It's like it's this--

23:15.200 --> 23:16.720
it's this contentment
deficiency.

23:16.759 --> 23:18.480
Even if I'm happy, I--

23:18.519 --> 23:22.240
I start picking at flaws,
looking for things to fix.

23:22.279 --> 23:26.119
-You can't just be happy?

23:26.160 --> 23:29.359
-Right now, I'm pretty good,
except I'm really

23:29.400 --> 23:30.519
self-conscious about my toes.

23:30.559 --> 23:32.119
They do not belong in public.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.480
And I should be putting
in some extra

23:33.519 --> 23:34.720
training at the studio.

23:34.759 --> 23:36.319
But aside from that, I thing
that I'm pretty--

23:36.359 --> 23:37.640
Christian, Christian, no.
