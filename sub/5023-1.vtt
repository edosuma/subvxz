01:27.096 --> 01:29.326
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>for every vampire... </i>

01:29.536 --> 01:34.530
<i>... when the idea of eternity becomes</i>
<i>momentarily unbearable. </i>

01:34.736 --> 01:38.775
<i>Living and feeding in the shadows</i>
<i>with only your own company... </i>

01:38.976 --> 01:42.855
<i>... rots into a solitary, </i>
<i>hollow existence. </i>

01:43.056 --> 01:45.524
<i>Immortality seems like a good idea... </i>

01:45.976 --> 01:49.651
<i>... until you realize</i>
<i>you're going to spend it alone. </i>

01:49.856 --> 01:54.213
<i>So I slept, hoping the sounds</i>
<i>of the passing eras would fade out... </i>

01:54.456 --> 01:56.572
<i>... and a sort of death might happen. </i>

01:56.776 --> 02:01.292
<i>But as I lay there, the world didn 't</i>
<i>sound like the place I had left... </i>

02:01.736 --> 02:04.887
<i>... but something different. </i>

02:05.376 --> 02:07.412
<i>Better... </i>

02:37.656 --> 02:42.776
<i>It became worthwhile to rise again</i>
<i>as new gods were born and worshiped. </i>

02:42.976 --> 02:46.013
<i>Night and day, they were never alone. </i>

02:46.216 --> 02:49.891
<i>I would become one of them. </i>

03:17.136 --> 03:21.175
<i>Whether it was the meal or</i>
<i>the 1 00 years of rest, I'm not sure. </i>

03:21.376 --> 03:24.607
<i>But suddenly</i>
<i>I was feeling better than ever. </i>

03:24.896 --> 03:26.932
<i>My senses so high... </i>

03:27.136 --> 03:31.732
<i>... they led me straight to the</i>
<i>instrument of my resurrection... </i>

03:31.936 --> 03:35.645
<i>... playing in my old house. </i>

04:03.536 --> 04:05.367
Jesus.

04:06.616 --> 04:08.129
Your voice... .

04:08.536 --> 04:09.935
Who the hell are you?

04:10.136 --> 04:14.368
<i>The question provoked</i>
<i>an irresistible urge. </i>

04:14.576 --> 04:17.374
l am the vampire Lestat.

04:17.576 --> 04:19.531
<i>It just rolled out of my mouth. </i>

04:19.736 --> 04:23.285
<i>With one sentence, </i>
<i>I betrayed everything about my kind. </i>

04:23.496 --> 04:25.407
<i>Betrayed our code of secrecy. </i>

04:25.616 --> 04:27.572
Vampire?

04:28.016 --> 04:31.213
- That's funny.
- Lndeed.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.805
Hilarious.

04:34.696 --> 04:36.573
You're all...

04:36.776 --> 04:38.414
...so beautiful.

04:38.976 --> 04:42.446
- Your hands are...
- Cold as death?

04:43.496 --> 04:45.566
- You're gonna kill us?
- No.

04:45.896 --> 04:50.492
All that you've ever dreamed of,
l'm going to make yours.

04:50.696 --> 04:53.210
This is your lucky day.

04:53.416 --> 04:55.691
<i>It was a bold move, I admit. </i>

04:55.936 --> 05:00.088
<i>But from that moment on they were</i>
<i>my friends, my children, my band. </i>

05:00.296 --> 05:03.732
<i>Giving the world a new god. </i>
<i>Me. </i>

06:50.296 --> 06:55.689
Okay, can l have your attention?
Okay, some questions. One at a time.

06:56.896 --> 06:59.285
- Yeah, you.
- So why here in London?

06:59.496 --> 07:02.010
We go where we're told to, like you.

07:02.216 --> 07:07.290
- How would you sum up your music?
- Sex, blood and rock and roll.

07:07.936 --> 07:09.494
Okay, excuse me.

07:10.776 --> 07:12.255
lt's time.

07:12.456 --> 07:14.048
May l present...

07:14.256 --> 07:17.771
...the vampire Lestat.

07:22.456 --> 07:23.650
<i>Good evening. </i>

07:25.136 --> 07:29.652
<i>Sorry I'm late. I was just trying</i>
<i>to catch my breakfast. </i>

07:32.296 --> 07:35.572
Okay, can we keep it short?
One at a time.

07:35.896 --> 07:37.045
Yeah, you.

07:37.456 --> 07:40.971
l may be wrong, but what
l remember about vampires is...

07:41.176 --> 07:44.134
...you generally keep
your identity secret.

07:44.336 --> 07:47.612
<i>Yes. But why hide it</i>
<i>in this day and age? </i>

07:47.816 --> 07:50.376
<i>I've hidden in the shadows</i>
<i>for centuries. </i>

07:50.576 --> 07:53.215
<i>It's time to share myself</i>
<i>with the world. </i>

07:53.736 --> 07:58.366
Could you prove it? You know, give us
a demonstration of your powers.

07:58.576 --> 08:03.604
<i>If you like, I can give you a private</i>
<i>demonstration in your hotel tonight. </i>

08:07.536 --> 08:11.688
Your first and only concert's
in Death Valley, just days away.

08:11.936 --> 08:15.212
- Why just the one?
- <i>I don 't like repeating myself. </i>

08:15.416 --> 08:20.046
There are rumors about
the hidden meaning in your lyrics...

08:20.256 --> 08:23.805
...that you're giving away
vampire secrets. Ls that true?

08:24.056 --> 08:29.210
<i>Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few</i>
<i>old friends. Daring them to come out. </i>

08:29.416 --> 08:33.648
Won't these vampires be pissed off
that you're giving away secrets?

08:34.336 --> 08:37.486
<i>I imagine they are, yes. </i>

08:37.696 --> 08:41.166
Do you have anything to say
to the other vampires?

08:41.376 --> 08:44.288
<i>As a matter of fact, I do. </i>

08:45.816 --> 08:50.367
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are. </i>

08:52.096 --> 08:55.566
<i>See you all in Death Valley. </i>

09:16.776 --> 09:21.292
l heard Lestat keeps all these girls
in his cellar. And it's nice.

09:21.496 --> 09:24.090
They give you food
and cable and weed.

09:24.296 --> 09:25.695
Oh, please.

09:25.936 --> 09:30.487
But you have to let him suck you
on your neck whenever he wants.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.733
- Doesn't sound too bad.
- Done worse.

09:33.936 --> 09:35.733
- L'll say.
- This way, girls.

09:48.736 --> 09:51.250
So this is Lestat's house?

09:51.456 --> 09:54.653
lt is this week. We move around a lot.

09:54.896 --> 09:56.295
Why is that?

09:56.976 --> 10:00.093
What can l say? The guy is just... .

10:01.616 --> 10:06.929
- Boss. L didn't see you there.
- No. You wouldn't, would you?

10:10.336 --> 10:13.612
These are the girls
that you asked for.

10:14.296 --> 10:15.775
Yes.

10:30.816 --> 10:33.853
Do you want me to take
the girls home later?

10:34.056 --> 10:36.126
No, thank you, Roger.

10:36.336 --> 10:38.930
l'll make sure they're taken care of.

10:41.536 --> 10:43.492
You want some?

10:44.456 --> 10:46.367
Want me?

10:47.376 --> 10:49.048
You hungry?

10:53.096 --> 10:56.452
You hungry for something else?

11:00.456 --> 11:02.174
Come on.

11:02.616 --> 11:05.972
- Don't you want to have some fun?
- Don't do that.

11:06.256 --> 11:08.486
Are you ticklish?

11:08.696 --> 11:11.256
l'm very ticklish.

12:14.616 --> 12:16.686
Come out, come out...

12:16.936 --> 12:19.245
...whoever you are.

12:27.136 --> 12:28.774
<i>Jesse. </i>

12:30.536 --> 12:33.573
<i>Jesse. </i>

12:33.776 --> 12:35.255
<i>A voice... </i>

12:36.176 --> 12:38.212
<i>... calling to me... </i>

12:38.416 --> 12:40.407
<i>... in my dreams. </i>

12:40.616 --> 12:44.131
<i>The same dream I've had</i>
<i>since I was 6.</i>

12:44.536 --> 12:47.255
<i>I have a family of my own. </i>

12:47.576 --> 12:50.136
<i>Not a strange dream, really. </i>

12:50.336 --> 12:52.930
<i>One every orphan has. </i>

13:19.576 --> 13:21.328
l'm sorry, but you must go.

13:21.536 --> 13:25.165
Why can't l stay with you?
Please, Aunt Maharet.

13:25.376 --> 13:28.686
l don't want you to go. But you must.

13:29.136 --> 13:31.855
Aunt, you're bleeding.

13:38.296 --> 13:40.173
You must be with your own.

13:40.376 --> 13:44.892
- <i>I knew things were not normal. </i>
- This isn't the life l wanted for you.

13:45.096 --> 13:49.009
<i>I only knew I was part of them, </i>
<i>and being cast out. </i>

13:49.216 --> 13:50.410
<i>Was I bad? </i>

13:50.616 --> 13:52.652
<i>Had I done something wrong? </i>

13:52.856 --> 13:55.211
l'll always be watching over you.

13:55.416 --> 13:57.771
l want to stay with you forever.

13:58.016 --> 14:00.405
You can't.

14:34.736 --> 14:36.852
<i>I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News. </i>

14:37.056 --> 14:41.766
<i>Vampire turned rocker Lestat</i>
<i>has returned with a new CD, </i> Forsaken.

14:41.976 --> 14:43.887
<i>Although from New Orleans... </i>

14:44.096 --> 14:47.486
<i>... he claims to be an 1 8th</i>-<i>century</i>
<i>French nobleman... </i>

14:47.696 --> 14:50.256
<i>... who has been asleep</i>
<i>for over 1 00 years. </i>

14:50.456 --> 14:56.053
<i>Here's a look at the new video</i>
<i>from the debut album, "Redeemer. "</i>

16:01.936 --> 16:04.575
<i>Like everyone, I assumed</i>
<i>Lestat was a joke. </i>

16:04.776 --> 16:09.691
A rock star with a gimmick. Then one
of his lyrics caught my attention.

16:10.016 --> 16:13.133
"Take a walk down the aisle
at the end of the mile.

16:13.336 --> 16:16.453
Give your life to my charms
in the Admiral's Arms. "

16:16.656 --> 16:18.135
That rang a bell.

16:18.336 --> 16:20.850
l tracked down old leases in London.

16:21.056 --> 16:25.049
lt turns out in the late 1 600s
there was a pub in Mile End...

16:25.256 --> 16:27.053
...called the Admiral's Arms.

16:27.256 --> 16:30.293
lt had a reputation for dealing
with black magic...

16:30.496 --> 16:32.964
...and reports of people vanishing.

16:33.176 --> 16:38.250
Here's where you could find
the Admiral's Arms in old London.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.334
That part of London
is mostly warehouses...

16:41.536 --> 16:45.495
...meat-packing plants and
a private club in the same location.

16:46.736 --> 16:50.092
l think that it's a vampire coven.

16:50.296 --> 16:52.935
And Lestat is leading us to it.

16:54.936 --> 16:57.894
- Who took this picture?
- L did.

16:58.096 --> 17:01.645
You're still an apprentice.
You don't do field work.

17:01.856 --> 17:03.414
The Talamasca has a code.

17:03.616 --> 17:07.086
l know. "Observe the dark realm,
but be not of it. "

17:07.296 --> 17:10.094
Well, it's held good for 1 2 centuries.

17:10.296 --> 17:14.050
We record and observe,
but never interfere.

17:14.256 --> 17:16.291
l had to see it for myself.

17:19.096 --> 17:21.165
ls David aware of this?

17:21.695 --> 17:22.685
Jesse?

17:25.136 --> 17:26.125
Hello, David.

17:26.896 --> 17:30.411
- L was explaining...
- Why don't you see me in my office?

17:33.536 --> 17:36.573
This is a real coven.
ln the middle of London.

17:36.776 --> 17:40.007
All the more reason
to have told me first.

17:41.576 --> 17:43.168
Listen, Jesse...

17:46.456 --> 17:48.970
...we know about Lestat.

17:49.376 --> 17:52.049
What he's doing is unprecedented.

17:53.016 --> 17:54.529
So why is he doing it?

17:54.736 --> 17:58.172
Aren't you curious?
Don't you think we should find out?

17:59.536 --> 18:01.606
Let me show you something.

18:04.576 --> 18:06.407
What do you see?

18:09.016 --> 18:11.530
Mid-1 500s. Florence.

18:12.616 --> 18:14.129
This one?

18:17.776 --> 18:20.688
- This man is in both.
- Yes.

18:22.976 --> 18:25.206
All the different paint samples...

18:25.896 --> 18:27.693
...all authentic.

18:27.896 --> 18:31.411
Each painted at the time
of their particular style.

18:37.696 --> 18:39.766
His name is Marius.

18:40.616 --> 18:43.335
l've been tracing him for years.

18:43.776 --> 18:45.767
My little obsession.

18:46.016 --> 18:49.008
The closest we've come
to the original vampire.

18:49.296 --> 18:52.766
Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.

18:56.016 --> 18:58.371
So he's older than Lestat.

18:58.576 --> 19:00.646
He made Lestat.

19:01.336 --> 19:02.655
How do you know that?

19:02.896 --> 19:05.615
Because l have Lestat's journal.

19:08.896 --> 19:10.249
l want to see it.

19:12.496 --> 19:15.454
Promise me you'll never
go back to that place.

19:45.496 --> 19:48.806
<i>It was the winter of 1 788.</i>

19:49.016 --> 19:53.771
<i>And I was brought to a Mediterranean</i>
<i>island by the man who made me. </i>

19:55.096 --> 19:58.611
<i>If a man is what you'd call him. </i>

20:46.096 --> 20:48.405
Lestat, welcome.

20:50.416 --> 20:51.769
Who are you?

20:52.016 --> 20:53.847
Do l know you?

20:56.256 --> 20:59.965
l am unknowable by nature,
but you may call me Marius.

21:00.176 --> 21:04.806
l'm the lord of a great manor.
They'll send an army to look for me.

21:05.016 --> 21:07.928
l doubt they'll find you,
Lord de Lioncourt.

21:08.136 --> 21:10.047
You're a long way from home.

21:38.096 --> 21:39.609
You're weak...

21:40.136 --> 21:41.489
...near passing.

21:43.256 --> 21:45.770
l can barely hear your heartbeat.

21:46.856 --> 21:51.930
The future hastens.
An age beyond my antique reason.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.969
You will help me understand
these times.

21:55.336 --> 21:57.327
That's why l chose you.

21:57.696 --> 21:59.209
Chose me for what?

22:08.656 --> 22:10.055
Drink...

22:10.536 --> 22:12.094
...and live.

22:12.976 --> 22:16.093
You've been brave enough
for one night, my son.

22:18.736 --> 22:20.852
Drink...

22:22.256 --> 22:24.212
...and learn.

22:26.416 --> 22:28.930
Good, is it not?

22:32.576 --> 22:35.044
No more. No more, Lestat.

22:36.416 --> 22:38.213
No more!

23:11.136 --> 23:13.445
Don't be afraid.

23:13.696 --> 23:16.608
lt's only your body that dies.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.726
More.

23:35.016 --> 23:38.372
<i>I impressed my maker</i>
<i>with my thirst for things. </i>

23:38.576 --> 23:41.136
<i>He set out to educate me</i>
<i>in the unknown. </i>

23:41.336 --> 23:45.727
<i>Taught me all about the world, </i>
<i>its hidden history... </i>

23:45.976 --> 23:48.251
<i>... and about myself. </i>

23:53.456 --> 23:55.686
That's enough, my son.

23:58.456 --> 24:01.573
When you feed, hold back
from the moment of death.

24:01.776 --> 24:06.167
Never take the last drop, or it will
draw you in and you will die.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.606
Appreciate your prey.

24:18.536 --> 24:22.654
Their blood that we take into us
carries with it life...

24:22.896 --> 24:27.333
...their life, their knowledge,
their complexity.

24:30.256 --> 24:33.646
<i>My senses run amuck, </i>
<i>like a newborn child. </i>

24:34.456 --> 24:39.655
<i>And as for my new powers, I was beside</i>
<i>myself with the pleasure of it all. </i>

24:42.056 --> 24:43.648
We've stayed long enough.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.568
But we've spoken to no one.

24:46.096 --> 24:48.769
A vampire's life
is a life of discretion.

24:49.016 --> 24:50.495
Discretion?

24:51.136 --> 24:53.013
Why must we hide, Marius?

24:53.216 --> 24:56.413
We are the powerful,
we are the immortal.

24:56.616 --> 24:59.972
We should walk fearless
in the open, no?

25:10.216 --> 25:12.366
That cannot be.

25:13.336 --> 25:15.930
We're vulnerable during the day.

25:16.136 --> 25:20.129
Mortals must never know about us,
for the sake of all our kind.

25:20.576 --> 25:22.646
So l could never know her?

25:22.896 --> 25:25.091
Not unless you wanted to kill her.

25:32.096 --> 25:33.848
So l can never be known?

25:36.416 --> 25:39.089
You must be dead to the world.

25:40.256 --> 25:42.531
Come on, time to leave.

26:41.016 --> 26:43.166
Sophia, run! Run!

26:43.496 --> 26:45.805
Go! Go...

26:46.576 --> 26:47.804
Lestat...

26:48.016 --> 26:50.211
...stop her!

26:50.976 --> 26:51.965
You must!

27:28.056 --> 27:31.810
We must remain in the shadows.

27:33.136 --> 27:36.572
You still have a few
lingering mortal emotions.

27:37.616 --> 27:40.847
They'll serve you no good, my friend.

27:52.936 --> 27:54.733
Forgive me.

28:01.496 --> 28:07.332
<i>The faces of my victims haunted me, </i>
<i>reminding me of my fate. </i>

28:07.536 --> 28:09.766
<i>For nights and days I played... </i>

28:09.976 --> 28:15.448
<i>... furious that I would never partake</i>
<i>of the simple joys of the world. </i>

28:15.656 --> 28:17.806
<i>I was meant for more than this. </i>

28:55.816 --> 28:57.568
Marius?

30:15.656 --> 30:18.216
Would you like me to play for you?

32:40.136 --> 32:42.650
What have you done, Lestat?

32:51.576 --> 32:55.171
- More!
- L don't think so, my little lord.

32:55.376 --> 32:57.287
- Let me go.
- No.

32:57.496 --> 33:00.852
You've had the purest blood,
seen the oldest things.

33:01.056 --> 33:06.255
- Far too much for one as young as you.
- Her blood is like liquid fire.

33:06.456 --> 33:07.855
Who is she?

33:13.056 --> 33:15.047
She's your mother.

33:15.256 --> 33:17.212
She's my mother.

33:17.416 --> 33:21.409
Akasha, the queen of all
who are damned.

33:22.096 --> 33:23.927
And he's her king.

33:24.376 --> 33:29.325
Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this
earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.

33:29.536 --> 33:33.324
They drank until Enkil
lost his will to drink.

33:33.536 --> 33:38.246
Without her mate beside her, she also
lost hers. They became living statues.

33:38.456 --> 33:43.894
She respects nothing except the taste
of blood, human and immortal alike.

33:44.216 --> 33:45.695
No. Release me!

33:51.496 --> 33:53.805
She made you quite powerful.

33:54.016 --> 33:56.166
You'll not stop me!

33:57.336 --> 34:00.089
Can l hear her blood in your voice?

34:00.896 --> 34:04.252
ln all the years of my care,
not once have they moved.

34:04.456 --> 34:08.005
Until tonight. And she chose me.

34:08.896 --> 34:10.409
l chose you.

34:14.295 --> 34:17.493
Where are you going?! Marius!

35:12.576 --> 35:18.651
<i>Many times since, I have called</i>
<i>to Marius. But there was no answer. </i>

35:19.216 --> 35:23.448
<i>Just the endless procession</i>
<i>of days, months... </i>

35:23.656 --> 35:25.135
<i>... years. </i>

35:26.216 --> 35:29.731
<i>My teacher left me</i>
<i>to my darkest lesson. </i>

35:29.936 --> 35:32.006
<i>That in the end, we are alone. </i>

35:32.856 --> 35:38.567
<i>And there is nothing but the cold, </i>
<i>dark wasteland of eternity. </i>

36:02.456 --> 36:05.812
<i>David thought the journal</i>
<i>would satisfy my curiosity. </i>

36:06.416 --> 36:09.453
<i>But it only made me want</i>
<i>to know more. </i>

36:09.656 --> 36:12.216
<i>I had to go back</i>
<i>to the Admiral's Arms. </i>

36:12.416 --> 36:14.725
<i>I had no choice. </i>

36:49.736 --> 36:52.614
<i>This is a fantastic place. I love it. </i>

36:53.256 --> 36:55.975
You sure l can't get you a drink?

36:56.896 --> 36:58.090
Soon.

37:58.216 --> 37:59.695
Hi.

38:00.536 --> 38:01.935
- Hi.
- Come here often?

38:02.296 --> 38:03.968
All the time.

38:07.656 --> 38:10.375
l don't see any marks.

38:10.576 --> 38:13.010
You haven't seen the rest of my body.

38:14.016 --> 38:16.450
ls that an invitation?

38:16.656 --> 38:18.692
Sorry, l'm taken.

38:18.896 --> 38:20.614
And...

38:21.256 --> 38:23.247
...where is your host?

38:23.656 --> 38:24.975
He's here somewhere.

38:28.496 --> 38:32.011
This host, what's his name?

38:35.856 --> 38:37.130
Marius.

38:37.936 --> 38:40.530
Sorry, don't know the guy.

38:40.736 --> 38:44.934
- Of course not. He's an ancient.
- There aren't any ancients left.

38:45.136 --> 38:47.696
They all turned to dust.

38:48.056 --> 38:51.128
So unless you've got him in a bottle
somewhere... .

38:51.336 --> 38:54.214
You're brave to joke.
l wish you could meet him.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.931
- And why is that?
- Because you might learn something.

39:01.216 --> 39:03.172
Excuse me.

39:16.936 --> 39:18.528
Going somewhere?

39:20.376 --> 39:23.254
Now this will only hurt a little bit.

39:23.616 --> 39:27.291
ln fact, you might even enjoy it.

39:27.496 --> 39:28.451
Don't do this.

39:48.256 --> 39:49.689
Boo.

40:04.616 --> 40:07.847
That was quite a performance.

40:08.456 --> 40:11.129
You should be more careful.

40:12.176 --> 40:15.327
- Thanks.
- For what?

40:15.656 --> 40:17.408
You saved me.

40:18.096 --> 40:20.007
How presumptuous.

40:20.856 --> 40:24.246
So you know Marius?

40:26.416 --> 40:28.008
l know a lot of things.

40:28.216 --> 40:30.810
Not how to stay alive, apparently.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.166
l guess we have that in common.

40:33.696 --> 40:36.494
Although l'm a little ahead
of the race here.

40:36.696 --> 40:39.164
Well, l can fix that.

40:39.736 --> 40:43.888
Your song "Redeemer" is about
the girl with the violin. Lsn't it?

40:45.536 --> 40:46.651
Yeah.

40:46.896 --> 40:48.249
ls it?

40:51.056 --> 40:53.251
What else do you think you know?

40:54.296 --> 40:55.490
l... .

40:55.696 --> 40:58.051
You're shaking.

40:58.256 --> 40:59.609
Cold.

41:00.576 --> 41:02.055
Still cold?

41:03.576 --> 41:07.330
Go on. Tell me more about me.

41:07.576 --> 41:09.134
You want... .

41:09.336 --> 41:11.213
What do l want?

41:12.536 --> 41:15.846
- You yearn.
- What do l yearn?

41:19.096 --> 41:21.735
For what do l yearn?

41:21.936 --> 41:23.972
To walk with the living.

41:25.456 --> 41:29.734
Out of the cold,
dark wasteland of eternity.

41:33.136 --> 41:34.125
Well...

41:36.456 --> 41:39.653
...that makes you
a very clever librarian.

41:39.856 --> 41:42.245
Talamasca.

41:42.456 --> 41:45.846
l knew l left that journal somewhere.

41:48.536 --> 41:52.290
- Was it a good read?
- Lt touched me.

41:52.856 --> 41:54.414
Did it, now?

41:55.856 --> 41:57.574
Don't worry, Jesse.

41:58.056 --> 42:00.490
Your kind never satisfies my thirst.

42:03.376 --> 42:06.607
Lestat, l know something
that's not in your journal.

42:09.096 --> 42:10.085
What?

42:10.536 --> 42:12.891
You still have the violin, don't you?

42:13.536 --> 42:15.492
No, l understand.

42:16.416 --> 42:18.088
After all, it's only human.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.367
Clever librarian.

43:24.176 --> 43:27.930
David, listen, l'm going
to Los Angeles for the concert.

43:28.576 --> 43:31.488
<i>I met him, David. I talked to Lestat. </i>

43:31.816 --> 43:33.886
What? Jesse?

43:34.096 --> 43:37.486
Listen to me very carefully now.

43:39.096 --> 43:41.849
You are no longer seeing
things clearly.

43:42.136 --> 43:45.765
<i>Lestat told the world that vampires</i>
<i>live among us. They're mad. </i>

43:45.976 --> 43:50.254
<i>They'll be at the concert to kill him. </i>
<i>You've become obsessed with it. </i>

43:50.456 --> 43:55.052
- <i>I'm worried about you. </i>
- Don't worry about me. L'll be okay.

43:55.256 --> 43:57.053
l'll check in and... .

43:58.056 --> 43:59.614
l'm sorry. L have to go.

43:59.816 --> 44:01.329
No, Jesse...

44:17.496 --> 44:21.284
<i>The city of Lost Angels already</i>
<i>fed on the blood of youth. </i>

44:21.496 --> 44:24.568
<i>My presence here barely</i>
<i>stirred a ripple. </i>

44:24.776 --> 44:27.085
<i>We had three days till the concert. </i>

44:27.296 --> 44:29.685
<i>I could feel something was coming. </i>

44:29.896 --> 44:32.933
<i>I just couldn 't figure out what. </i>

45:04.416 --> 45:05.895
Marius.

45:17.416 --> 45:19.134
Lestat.

45:20.456 --> 45:22.765
lt is good to see you, Lestat.

45:24.096 --> 45:25.324
And you.

45:25.576 --> 45:29.091
Still wearing the old fashions, l see.

45:30.776 --> 45:32.892
Old habits die hard.

45:33.096 --> 45:38.011
How did you manage to slip
through the '50s in red velvet?

45:38.656 --> 45:40.089
l slept.

45:41.376 --> 45:43.571
Don't think you missed much.

45:44.696 --> 45:48.245
- Elvis.
- Elvis, yes.

45:50.376 --> 45:52.367
You're bigger than he is now.

45:52.696 --> 45:53.685
So... .

45:54.536 --> 45:56.572
After all this time...

45:57.096 --> 45:58.927
...what's the occasion?

45:59.136 --> 46:04.415
You've just become very hard to avoid
these days, at least in conversation.

46:05.376 --> 46:08.766
- What are you trying to prove, Lestat?
- Oh, please.

46:08.976 --> 46:12.969
lt's a little too late to come over
all paternal now, Marius.

46:13.176 --> 46:16.805
Two hundred years
and not a word from you.

46:18.016 --> 46:21.008
You almost cost me everything.

46:23.776 --> 46:25.334
Now you've done it again.

46:25.976 --> 46:29.332
This isn't the time to settle
old scores.

46:30.976 --> 46:33.888
Vampires don't settle old scores.

46:35.936 --> 46:38.211
We harbor them.

46:42.376 --> 46:44.094
How did you find me?

46:44.576 --> 46:45.929
l made you.

46:46.216 --> 46:48.446
l've always known where you are.

46:49.256 --> 46:50.609
Besides...

46:50.976 --> 46:55.094
...l just had to look for the most
gauche house on the block.

46:56.656 --> 47:00.285
Come. Let me show you what it means
to live in the light.

47:09.936 --> 47:11.130
lmpressive.

47:11.336 --> 47:15.534
Reminds me of old mad druids
running around chanting in the forest.

47:15.736 --> 47:17.727
A return to the primitive.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.292
Out there, my fans...

47:21.536 --> 47:23.094
...they worship me.

47:23.456 --> 47:28.371
Millions of arms reach out to embrace,
beg me to come into their lives.

47:28.576 --> 47:30.453
lt's what you always wanted.

47:30.656 --> 47:33.216
With all my black little heart.

47:34.496 --> 47:37.693
Did you think of anyone but yourself?

47:38.096 --> 47:41.247
l only have myself.
You taught me that.

47:41.936 --> 47:45.167
lt may be time to get ready
for some company.

47:45.376 --> 47:50.769
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your music's woken an old friend.

47:52.616 --> 47:54.174
Can't you hear it?

47:54.656 --> 47:58.092
Or is the applause all you
can hear now?

48:16.416 --> 48:17.690
Akasha.

48:18.456 --> 48:20.048
Arisen.

48:20.656 --> 48:23.375
She has taken the king's blood.

48:23.576 --> 48:25.407
Absorbed his power.

48:26.016 --> 48:29.008
Good. Let her come.

48:29.296 --> 48:31.366
Cancel the concert.

48:31.656 --> 48:32.975
Never.

48:33.496 --> 48:37.284
You're no match for her, Lestat.
You're not a god.

48:37.976 --> 48:40.649
We were once mortals too.

48:41.616 --> 48:44.289
lt is our heritage we protect.

48:44.496 --> 48:47.169
Such reverence for mortals.

48:47.376 --> 48:50.254
Then you should have left me as one.

49:48.456 --> 49:53.576
Scent is fading.
He was here too long ago.

49:53.776 --> 49:55.414
You like him, do you?

49:56.496 --> 49:58.452
He reminds me of someone.

49:58.656 --> 50:03.172
All he's going to remind you of soon
is a pile of bones.

50:03.376 --> 50:06.368
We're going to dismember him.
Bleed him dry.

50:06.576 --> 50:07.691
Really?

50:08.936 --> 50:12.212
ls that what you're going to do?

53:03.216 --> 53:06.572
<i>Old gods on new streets. </i>

53:07.056 --> 53:10.366
<i>Not only had the concert sold out</i>
<i>among the living... </i>

53:10.576 --> 53:13.568
<i>... it seemed all the undead</i>
<i>were coming too. </i>

53:13.776 --> 53:16.495
<i>There would be angry vampires</i>
<i>out there... </i>

53:16.696 --> 53:20.689
<i>... frightened of the light I was</i>
<i>directing on all our kind. </i>

53:20.936 --> 53:24.292
<i>Do you have anything to say</i>
<i>to the other vampires? </i>

53:24.496 --> 53:28.171
<i>Yes, as a matter of fact, I do. </i>

53:29.096 --> 53:32.327
<i>Come out, come out, wherever you are. </i>

53:33.096 --> 53:35.052
<i>They wanted me dead. </i>

53:35.256 --> 53:36.894
<i>Let them try. </i>

53:37.216 --> 53:38.615
<i>Bring it on. </i>

53:39.016 --> 53:41.689
<i>Better dead than alone. </i>

53:56.736 --> 53:59.170
Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?

53:59.376 --> 54:01.094
- Going to the show?
- No.

54:01.296 --> 54:04.845
- Come on, l got them for $200.
- $200?! L don't think so.

54:05.056 --> 54:10.688
- What if l say 1 50?
- 1 50? You're gonna cut me a deal?

54:10.936 --> 54:14.929
So, listen, just two girls, okay?
So how old are you again?

54:17.776 --> 54:20.927
- Check it out. Champagne?
- Yeah.

54:37.376 --> 54:42.291
Oh, my God, l can't believe
it's really you! L'm your biggest fan.

54:44.256 --> 54:45.575
Boo.

54:46.496 --> 54:47.724
Boo back.

54:48.616 --> 54:51.130
Lestat, l came all the way
from Tarzana.

54:51.336 --> 54:52.371
Really?

54:53.336 --> 54:54.928
- And you?
- London.

54:56.136 --> 54:58.570
A London Goth. L see.

54:59.656 --> 55:04.172
lt's funny, l would have pegged you
for a Talamascan.

55:05.096 --> 55:06.893
Maybe in another life.

55:07.096 --> 55:08.654
l'm an Episcopalian.

55:09.136 --> 55:12.446
And l'm a frigging Buddhist.
Lestat... .

55:12.656 --> 55:16.808
Roger, would you take our little
Episcopalian back to church?

55:17.016 --> 55:19.405
Just the one tonight? Sure.

55:19.616 --> 55:22.733
- Sweetheart, come on.
- What?

55:23.376 --> 55:24.968
- Come on.
- What?!

55:25.176 --> 55:28.213
- Lt's a good thing.
- Can l still go backstage?

55:29.896 --> 55:32.330
Why are you following me?

55:32.576 --> 55:33.975
What do you want?

55:46.896 --> 55:51.048
So you come all this way
just to return this to me?

55:51.256 --> 55:54.054
Out of the goodness of your heart?

55:56.616 --> 55:59.176
l want you to show me what it's like.

55:59.536 --> 56:02.528
What what is like, exactly?

56:02.736 --> 56:04.852
To be like you.

56:07.696 --> 56:09.732
l don't have time for this.

56:10.096 --> 56:14.169
- All a vampire has is time.
- Not this one.

56:16.056 --> 56:17.205
Right.

56:17.456 --> 56:20.016
The covens are coming for you.

56:20.216 --> 56:24.687
How are you going to spend your last
night, as you always have, alone?

56:24.896 --> 56:26.045
Why not?

56:26.736 --> 56:29.045
Why not share it with me?

56:32.776 --> 56:34.209
All right.

56:36.856 --> 56:40.053
This may be painful for a mortal.

56:40.256 --> 56:43.293
You're still attached to your skin.

56:44.296 --> 56:45.934
l don't care.

56:48.416 --> 56:50.168
Do you trust me?

56:53.776 --> 56:55.255
Yes.

57:04.056 --> 57:06.286
Then close your eyes.

58:20.496 --> 58:22.373
Marius was right.

58:22.576 --> 58:25.613
But l never understood
until l met you.

58:26.216 --> 58:28.127
What do you mean?

58:28.336 --> 58:31.487
You're beautiful to me
because you're human.

58:31.696 --> 58:33.766
Your frailty...

58:34.016 --> 58:35.893
...your short years...

58:38.216 --> 58:39.854
...your heart...

58:40.056 --> 58:42.729
...even as you think it's breaking.

58:46.936 --> 58:48.654
All that...

58:50.016 --> 58:54.487
...seems suddenly more precious
than anything l have ever known.

58:57.616 --> 59:00.335
l'm not as precious as you think.

59:09.416 --> 59:10.769
Do it.

59:14.256 --> 59:15.655
Please.

59:21.656 --> 59:23.851
Let me be with you.

59:26.016 --> 59:28.484
Let me know everything.

59:36.296 --> 59:38.730
You want to know everything?

59:40.736 --> 59:42.249
Come, then.

59:42.536 --> 59:44.288
l'll show you.

01:00:05.776 --> 01:00:08.165
What is it? What are we doing...?

01:00:52.136 --> 01:00:53.615
ls she all right?

01:00:57.776 --> 01:01:00.848
Get away! Get off me!

01:01:09.136 --> 01:01:10.728
Now you see?

01:01:11.256 --> 01:01:12.609
Are you ready?

01:01:14.336 --> 01:01:17.453
Now do you want it, huh?

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:21.485
No.

01:01:21.936 --> 01:01:24.496
Of course you don't.

01:02:21.336 --> 01:02:24.009
They're pretty worked-up.
How you feeling?

01:02:24.216 --> 01:02:25.888
Hey, girls, come on!

01:02:27.056 --> 01:02:30.128
Okay, through here. Let him through!

01:02:30.496 --> 01:02:31.849
Back off, fella!

01:02:32.056 --> 01:02:33.409
Come on, children.

01:02:33.616 --> 01:02:35.686
Okay, guys. Come on!

01:02:37.936 --> 01:02:39.892
Let him through.

01:02:45.176 --> 01:02:46.529
Jesse!

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:50.250
Jesse!

01:02:53.976 --> 01:02:55.375
Hello, David.

01:02:56.456 --> 01:02:59.653
l must show you my new
paintings sometime.

01:05:16.976 --> 01:05:18.091
Find Jesse.

01:06:04.536 --> 01:06:06.413
You want more?

01:06:09.736 --> 01:06:13.968
This one's for those
who've come for me.

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:07.569
Akasha.

01:10:24.016 --> 01:10:25.972
Akasha?!

01:10:26.536 --> 01:10:28.970
Why so surprised, my love?

01:10:29.736 --> 01:10:31.692
You called, l have come.

01:10:32.736 --> 01:10:33.771
My love?

01:10:34.256 --> 01:10:36.690
Never fear me, Lestat.

01:10:37.736 --> 01:10:39.852
All your wishes have come true.

01:10:40.056 --> 01:10:41.614
My wishes?

01:10:43.736 --> 01:10:47.206
For a companion to share eternity.

01:10:49.616 --> 01:10:53.325
You're bold, like your music.

01:10:55.136 --> 01:10:59.891
You live your life in the open,
like l did long ago...

01:11:00.976 --> 01:11:02.694
...when l had a king.

01:11:03.216 --> 01:11:04.285
Had a king?

01:11:04.696 --> 01:11:06.334
He's no more.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.406
Now you are my consort.

01:11:11.336 --> 01:11:13.406
That's why l kept you safe.

01:11:14.496 --> 01:11:16.009
Alive.

01:11:16.936 --> 01:11:18.369
You?

01:11:20.056 --> 01:11:22.729
You thought it was all you?

01:11:25.736 --> 01:11:28.648
The ego of a king as well.

01:11:28.896 --> 01:11:30.329
Yes.

01:11:31.536 --> 01:11:34.733
l know you, Lestat.

01:11:35.136 --> 01:11:39.049
l know that you crave to have
the world at your feet.

01:11:40.456 --> 01:11:43.766
And l have come to give it to you.

01:11:45.616 --> 01:11:47.527
Where are we?

01:11:48.336 --> 01:11:50.213
<i>We are home. </i>

01:11:50.736 --> 01:11:55.764
<i>We live everywhere</i>
<i>and anywhere we choose. </i>

01:11:56.176 --> 01:11:59.725
<i>The world is our garden. </i>

01:14:18.616 --> 01:14:22.575
<i>All these years I'd hoped</i>
<i>this place was real. </i>

01:14:24.656 --> 01:14:29.776
<i>For the first time in my life, </i>
<i>I feel like I'm home. </i>

01:14:30.336 --> 01:14:34.215
<i>Strange that this journey</i>
<i>should lead me here. </i>

01:14:34.416 --> 01:14:37.533
<i>This place that's haunted my dreams. </i>

01:14:42.696 --> 01:14:45.415
<i>Aunt, you're bleeding. </i>

01:14:45.616 --> 01:14:47.732
<i>You must be with your own. </i>

01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:52.645
<i>I'll always be watching over you. </i>

01:14:52.896 --> 01:14:55.490
<i>I want to stay with you forever. </i>

01:14:56.656 --> 01:14:59.045
Forever is a very long time.

01:15:02.256 --> 01:15:03.848
Aunt Maharet.

01:15:13.456 --> 01:15:16.892
You haven't aged,
you haven't changed at all.

01:15:19.696 --> 01:15:21.971
l was once a mortal too.

01:15:22.256 --> 01:15:26.169
l bore a child before Akasha took me.
l took care of that child...

01:15:26.376 --> 01:15:29.925
...and her children,
and her children's children.

01:15:30.416 --> 01:15:32.566
This is our family.

01:15:32.776 --> 01:15:35.244
My way of coping with eternity.

01:15:37.216 --> 01:15:41.846
You are what keeps me connected
to the world of the living.

01:15:42.456 --> 01:15:46.415
When your parents died, l brought
you here to take care of you.

01:15:51.696 --> 01:15:54.369
Now is not the time.

01:15:55.696 --> 01:15:59.325
You were seeking answers
and now you've found them.

01:15:59.696 --> 01:16:03.291
The family is who you are.

01:17:30.576 --> 01:17:34.535
Drinking my blood allows you
to live in the light.

01:17:34.736 --> 01:17:39.491
And soon the sun will no longer
sting your eyes.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:45.013
This is but a taste
of what we shall share, my love.

01:17:46.056 --> 01:17:47.694
My king...

01:17:48.496 --> 01:17:51.249
...behold our kingdom.

01:17:51.896 --> 01:17:54.171
A kingdom of corpses?

01:17:56.096 --> 01:17:59.372
- Why?
- Why not?

01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:01.688
This is why you have risen?

01:18:01.896 --> 01:18:05.093
They believed in nothing.

01:18:05.456 --> 01:18:06.969
Now they are nothing.

01:18:13.336 --> 01:18:16.294
But you and l,
we will change all that.

01:18:17.456 --> 01:18:21.972
We will give the world something
to believe in again.

01:18:23.096 --> 01:18:25.087
Now come, my love.

01:18:25.456 --> 01:18:27.447
We have a score to settle.

01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:41.610
Since my mortal death,
l have watched...

01:18:42.296 --> 01:18:46.414
...l have guided and cared
for my human family...

01:18:46.936 --> 01:18:49.689
...generations beyond memory.

01:18:51.696 --> 01:18:55.211
This is why we must fight Akasha.

01:18:56.496 --> 01:19:01.126
- For the sake of your great family.
- The world we know is about to end.

01:19:01.456 --> 01:19:05.290
The only way to prevent this
is through Akasha's destruction.

01:19:05.496 --> 01:19:06.929
But how?

01:19:07.496 --> 01:19:09.964
When she gives blood,
she's vulnerable.

01:19:10.176 --> 01:19:13.930
Whoever takes the last of her blood
will not survive it.

01:19:14.136 --> 01:19:15.694
What about Lestat?

01:19:15.896 --> 01:19:21.607
Lestat has joined with Akasha.
He's lost to us now. Forget him.

01:19:43.376 --> 01:19:44.889
My children.

01:19:46.976 --> 01:19:49.968
lt warms my blood
to see you all gathered...

01:19:50.416 --> 01:19:51.929
...plotting against me.

01:19:52.136 --> 01:19:54.445
- Akasha.
- Maharet.

01:19:55.256 --> 01:19:59.886
- You will address my king first.
- Lestat, what has she done to you?

01:20:02.416 --> 01:20:04.850
Lestat, step aside.

01:20:05.296 --> 01:20:06.206
Never.

01:20:06.416 --> 01:20:08.976
The world has changed
since you reigned.

01:20:09.176 --> 01:20:11.246
Then we shall change it back.

01:20:11.536 --> 01:20:13.606
Humans are animals...

01:20:14.256 --> 01:20:16.167
...brute creatures.

01:20:16.376 --> 01:20:21.325
- Their destruction can only make sense.
- We've found other ways to coexist.

01:20:21.536 --> 01:20:25.734
ln silence! Ln shadows and shame!
And for what?

01:20:25.936 --> 01:20:27.847
For respect of mortals?

01:20:28.056 --> 01:20:30.047
They are nothing to us.

01:20:30.256 --> 01:20:32.053
They are merely food.

01:20:32.856 --> 01:20:34.175
Akasha, please... .

01:20:34.376 --> 01:20:37.288
You think you can change my will?

01:20:37.936 --> 01:20:40.769
l've had enough of this discussion.

01:20:40.976 --> 01:20:42.455
Join me or die.

01:20:42.896 --> 01:20:44.454
l will not.

01:20:44.656 --> 01:20:46.374
- L will not.
- L will not.

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:48.089
l will not.

01:20:55.936 --> 01:20:57.335
Do you love me?

01:20:59.136 --> 01:21:01.730
- Yes.
- Then prove it.

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.129
Kill her.

01:21:06.176 --> 01:21:09.134
- She's nothing to me.
- Just the same...

01:21:10.096 --> 01:21:12.326
...l'd like for you to kill her.

01:21:16.056 --> 01:21:20.891
- You will not touch her!
- You still think to challenge me?!

01:21:24.096 --> 01:21:27.884
- Now.
- No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.

01:21:28.656 --> 01:21:30.533
lt's what l want.

01:21:36.656 --> 01:21:38.726
How sweet.

01:21:44.656 --> 01:21:46.169
l'm ready.

01:22:59.856 --> 01:23:01.847
See, my children?

01:23:02.976 --> 01:23:05.444
Remember your real family!

01:23:06.736 --> 01:23:08.294
Or join hers.

01:23:09.496 --> 01:23:11.009
Now...

01:23:12.856 --> 01:23:14.574
...give me my crown.

01:23:16.216 --> 01:23:18.286
Spoken like a true king.

01:23:21.336 --> 01:23:22.928
Come.

01:23:32.656 --> 01:23:35.932
You see how he obeys?

01:23:36.336 --> 01:23:37.610
You will...

01:23:38.576 --> 01:23:41.090
...or you will all die.

01:23:46.576 --> 01:23:48.328
That is enough, Lestat.

01:23:57.856 --> 01:23:59.687
That is enough, Lestat! Stop!

01:25:05.016 --> 01:25:07.371
You kill me...

01:25:07.576 --> 01:25:10.488
...you kill yourselves.

01:25:53.736 --> 01:25:55.454
Wait, Lestat.

01:25:58.136 --> 01:25:59.535
You must stop.

01:28:28.176 --> 01:28:31.248
She drank Akasha's last drop.

01:28:32.616 --> 01:28:36.325
She took Akasha's death into herself.

01:28:37.656 --> 01:28:39.248
She's not dead.

01:28:40.136 --> 01:28:42.172
She sleeps.

01:29:38.376 --> 01:29:39.889
Hello?

01:30:11.296 --> 01:30:12.968
Oh, my God!

01:30:13.776 --> 01:30:15.255
Jesse?

01:30:16.336 --> 01:30:17.735
Hello, David.

01:30:28.936 --> 01:30:30.972
David, this is Lestat.

01:30:31.536 --> 01:30:35.370
- Hello.
- L have something for you.

01:30:39.096 --> 01:30:40.768
l believe...

01:30:41.056 --> 01:30:43.650
...that you wanted this back.

01:30:45.696 --> 01:30:49.325
Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.

01:30:59.216 --> 01:31:00.968
- Can l ask...?
- What's it like?

01:31:02.536 --> 01:31:04.731
Do you want to find out?

01:31:05.696 --> 01:31:07.129
Me?

01:31:07.336 --> 01:31:09.850
No, l'm too old to live forever.

01:31:10.176 --> 01:31:12.974
Well, if you ever change your mind... .

01:31:15.696 --> 01:31:17.414
So this is goodbye.

01:31:18.336 --> 01:31:19.610
Yes.

01:32:16.416 --> 01:32:18.327
Hello, David.
