Okay, so the three rules

-<i> Señor, está contigo.</i>

41:37.262 --> 41:38.427
- [roars]

41:38.463 --> 41:39.662
-<i> Fuera!</i>

41:48.373 --> 41:50.806
- [panting]
<i>Mi niña.</i>

42:00.685 --> 42:03.619
- [speaking indistinctly]

42:05.356 --> 42:09.292
both: Mel!
<i>- Chiquita.</i>

42:09.327 --> 42:12.461
<i>- Seeing my sister smile,</i>
<i>my mom smile,</i>

42:12.497 --> 42:13.829
and, you know,
giving us hugs,

42:13.865 --> 42:16.299
then I felt at peace,
I felt joy.

42:16.334 --> 42:17.833
[laughter]

42:28.379 --> 42:30.179
- I missed you.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.315
-<i> I felt...</i>

42:32.350 --> 42:34.617
like I had gone
through hell and back.

42:34.652 --> 42:35.885
<i>[peaceful music]</i>

42:35.920 --> 42:39.288
<i>We survived</i>
<i>because of my mother,</i>

42:39.324 --> 42:43.893
because she was strong enough
to fight for us,

42:43.928 --> 42:46.862
to fight for me,
to fight for my sisters.

42:51.469 --> 42:53.202
- New games.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.305
[all chatting indistinctly]

42:56.341 --> 42:57.740
[laughter]

42:57.775 --> 42:59.091
<i>[scary music]</i>
