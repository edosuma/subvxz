WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:11.379 --> 00:12.793
Break and enter in
progress at 4 Clarke Street.

00:12.793 --> 00:14.103
Immediate assistance needed.

00:14.206 --> 00:16.172
I'm right
by the scene now.

00:16.172 --> 00:18.931
Okay, I'll check in and
call if I need backup.

00:18.931 --> 00:20.482
Okay.

00:28.655 --> 00:29.724
Come on!

00:33.068 --> 00:34.034
Easy Rex.

00:36.689 --> 00:37.586
SJPD!

00:37.586 --> 00:38.965
Show yourself!

01:04.379 --> 01:05.517
Come on out.

01:07.413 --> 01:08.068
Oh!

01:10.103 --> 01:10.931
Yes.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.103
Hello there Sarah.

01:14.551 --> 01:15.758
Don't you remember me?

01:16.275 --> 01:18.827
I'm Charlie's Aunt Miranda!

01:19.827 --> 01:21.172
Oh Rexie!

01:23.931 --> 01:26.482
Aunt Miranda!

01:42.551 --> 01:46.551
But can you really call it
breaking and entering-

01:46.551 --> 01:48.310
if I used
a key?

01:48.310 --> 01:49.241
Yes, we can.

01:49.241 --> 01:51.862
Well it's not my fault
he keeps a spare-

01:51.862 --> 01:54.379
in a fake rock
in his garden!

01:54.379 --> 01:55.689
What were you
even doing there?

01:55.689 --> 01:58.275
My investment club
was defrauded.

01:58.275 --> 01:59.206
The house-

01:59.206 --> 02:02.068
I broke into belonged
to our broker-

02:02.068 --> 02:03.482
Bruce Buckston.

02:03.482 --> 02:04.724
Investment club?

02:04.724 --> 02:05.896
Mm-hmm.

02:05.896 --> 02:07.137
So you mean there are
other people involved in this?

02:07.137 --> 02:08.931
It was something
I started

02:08.931 --> 02:10.965
with a few people
in our neighbourhood.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.724
We thought we'd have some fun
and maybe make a little money.

02:14.827 --> 02:16.896
And instead
we got conned!

02:16.896 --> 02:18.758
How much of a loss
are we talking about?

02:18.758 --> 02:20.931
Well Cloris could
lose her house.

02:23.551 --> 02:26.103
We were guaranteed
it was a sure thing.

02:26.103 --> 02:28.689
Do you have proof that your
broker was involved in this?

02:28.689 --> 02:30.862
That was what I
was looking for

02:30.862 --> 02:32.862
when Sarah and
Rex found me.

02:32.862 --> 02:35.241
He claims-

02:35.241 --> 02:36.172
he was conned too.

02:36.172 --> 02:38.172
But I'm not
so sure.

02:38.172 --> 02:39.655
I wanted to find
out for myself.

02:39.655 --> 02:41.689
You should have
come to us.

02:41.689 --> 02:43.827
Are you arresting me?

02:44.965 --> 02:46.448
So here's the deal.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.172
We are not going to keep
you in holding overnight.

02:48.931 --> 02:50.482
We are going to
let you go home.

02:50.482 --> 02:51.482
Under one condition.

02:51.482 --> 02:52.310
Anything.

02:52.310 --> 02:53.344
You do not
leave your house

02:54.310 --> 02:55.379
until we say
it's okay.

02:55.379 --> 02:57.034
So house arrest?

02:57.034 --> 02:59.068
Until we complete
the investigation.

02:59.068 --> 03:02.103
And do not reach out
to Bruce Buckston.

03:02.103 --> 03:03.586
Of course.

03:03.586 --> 03:04.689
Good.

03:05.275 --> 03:06.448
Now now all
you have to do

03:06.448 --> 03:08.620
is explain yourself
to a very angry nephew.

03:08.620 --> 03:09.620
Oh.

03:09.620 --> 03:10.448
Mmmm.

03:25.586 --> 03:26.586
I did
what I thought

03:26.586 --> 03:28.241
I had to
do Charlie.

03:28.241 --> 03:30.137
Let's just say you're lucky
you have friends in the force.

03:30.137 --> 03:30.965
Come on pal.

03:30.965 --> 03:32.413
You're not mad
at me are you?

03:32.413 --> 03:33.103
No no.

03:33.103 --> 03:33.965
Not at all.

03:33.965 --> 03:35.517
But just stay out
of it from now on.

03:35.517 --> 03:37.344
Everything will be fine.

03:37.344 --> 03:38.551
Are you sure

03:38.551 --> 03:40.172
I can't help you?

03:42.068 --> 03:44.172
Alright, fine.

03:44.172 --> 03:44.827
Hello Miranda.

03:44.827 --> 03:45.793
Miranda!

03:45.793 --> 03:47.344
Oh Cloris!

03:47.344 --> 03:48.275
George!

03:48.275 --> 03:49.793
Come meet my
nephew Charlie.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.000
The policeman?

03:53.275 --> 03:54.758
We've heard so
much about you.

03:54.758 --> 03:55.793
Nice to meet
you both.

03:55.793 --> 03:56.517
And-

03:56.517 --> 03:57.896
this is his
partner, Rex.

03:57.896 --> 03:59.310
Good looking animal.

03:59.310 --> 04:01.241
I had one like that
once, you know.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.517
And then one day the damn
thing just up and died.

04:03.517 --> 04:04.793
Oh!

04:04.793 --> 04:06.206
Not you, naturally!

04:06.206 --> 04:07.103
You're a good
looking fella!

04:07.103 --> 04:08.379
Yeah!

04:10.517 --> 04:12.000
What did he
have to say?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.206
When am I gonna
see a return?

04:13.206 --> 04:14.655
It's coming!

04:14.655 --> 04:16.551
Yeah, so is Christmas.

04:16.551 --> 04:18.551
I never should
have trusted you.

04:21.965 --> 04:24.586
I take it one of the members
of your investment club?

04:24.586 --> 04:25.551
Uh-huh.

04:25.551 --> 04:26.448
I thought

04:26.448 --> 04:28.172
we were going to
handle this ourselves.

04:28.172 --> 04:29.655
We were-

04:29.655 --> 04:31.448
until my recon
was interrupted.

04:31.448 --> 04:32.172
But anyway-

04:32.172 --> 04:33.379
Charlie's agreed
to help us

04:33.379 --> 04:34.586
in our investigation.

04:34.586 --> 04:35.344
Nope. No.

04:35.344 --> 04:37.724
Not your investigation.

04:37.724 --> 04:39.344
You're staying
out of this.

04:39.344 --> 04:41.275
You're all
staying out of this.

04:44.655 --> 04:46.275
Of course!

04:52.965 --> 04:54.793
Bad news, Superintendent?

04:54.793 --> 04:58.034
Yeah a case went late and
now my date's cancelled on me.

04:58.034 --> 04:59.275
Ughh.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.034
You think they'll
give you another shot?

05:01.034 --> 05:02.655
Unfortunately this
is not the first time.

05:02.655 --> 05:03.517
So-

05:04.551 --> 05:06.724
Yeah, things are done
with me and Ms. Leonard.

05:06.724 --> 05:07.517
Oh.

05:07.517 --> 05:08.620
Too bad.

05:09.241 --> 05:10.586
Yeah, unfortunately,
she was the one

05:10.586 --> 05:12.482
who had the tickets to
the Liberties concert.

05:12.482 --> 05:13.793
They're sold
out now too.

05:15.310 --> 05:16.586
Hold on, you
know about that?

05:16.586 --> 05:17.689
Yeah.

05:17.689 --> 05:18.793
I mean-

05:18.793 --> 05:20.724
even though there's only
one original member left.

05:20.724 --> 05:22.413
I always loved
the Philly sound.

05:22.413 --> 05:23.517
You don't say!

05:23.517 --> 05:25.000
Yeah, the O'Jays!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.206
Harold Melvin.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.931
I grew up on my dad's
record collection.

05:27.931 --> 05:28.862
Okay.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.103
Crazy idea, but-

05:32.103 --> 05:34.896
would you be interested in
going in on a reseller with me?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.275
Oh, can't do it.

05:36.275 --> 05:37.689
I have other plans.

05:38.310 --> 05:39.172
Sure.

05:39.172 --> 05:39.827
Of course.

05:39.827 --> 05:40.793
It's no problem.

05:40.793 --> 05:42.482
No, really.

05:42.482 --> 05:43.965
I have other plans.

05:43.965 --> 05:45.551
If I didn't want
to go out with you-

05:45.551 --> 05:47.482
I wouldn't be
afraid to say so.

05:55.448 --> 05:57.137
Look I understand
why your aunt

05:57.137 --> 05:58.034
and her friends
are upset.

05:58.034 --> 06:01.275
But to have them
break into my house-?

06:01.275 --> 06:02.310
You know?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.172
Invade my privacy?

06:04.827 --> 06:05.896
I know.

06:05.896 --> 06:08.586
You'd be well within your
right to press charges.

06:08.586 --> 06:10.206
Uh-

06:10.206 --> 06:11.275
No.

06:11.275 --> 06:13.862
No, I feel terrible about
what happened to them.

06:13.862 --> 06:14.862
And for me.

06:14.862 --> 06:16.482
Falling victim to
investment fraud

06:16.482 --> 06:18.068
doesn't do much
for my reputation.

06:18.068 --> 06:20.103
How did you come to be their
broker in the first place?

06:20.103 --> 06:21.517
George Horowitz was
an old boss of mine

06:21.517 --> 06:22.344
at the Bank
of Newfoundland.

06:22.344 --> 06:23.310
Hmm.

06:23.310 --> 06:25.413
We just kept in touch
after he retired.

06:25.413 --> 06:26.620
And you're still
working at the bank?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.137
No, I decided to go into the
investment game full time

06:29.137 --> 06:30.206
about a year ago.

06:30.206 --> 06:32.517
George and your aunt
were among my first clients.

06:33.206 --> 06:34.000
Huh.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.482
Can you tell me
about the fraud?

06:37.482 --> 06:39.413
A man named Nick
Sable contacted me

06:39.413 --> 06:41.137
with an opportunity to
get in on the ground floor

06:41.137 --> 06:43.068
of this organic farming
investment trust

06:43.068 --> 06:44.931
that had big potential.

06:47.620 --> 06:49.965
Organic farming is a
fast growing sector.

06:49.965 --> 06:53.103
So I brought this to your
aunt's investment group.

06:53.103 --> 06:54.103
Hmm.

06:54.103 --> 06:55.862
It looks impressive enough.

06:55.862 --> 06:57.103
It was.

06:57.103 --> 06:58.206
But when I transferred
the funds-

06:58.206 --> 06:59.793
Nick Sable disappeared
off the face of the Earth.

07:00.655 --> 07:01.551
How so?

07:01.551 --> 07:02.689
Well when I went
back to his offices-

07:02.689 --> 07:04.379
the place was
a ghost town.

07:04.379 --> 07:06.517
No trace that they
were ever there.

07:06.517 --> 07:07.896
Look Detective.

07:07.896 --> 07:08.862
If you don't mind-

07:08.862 --> 07:10.413
I'd like to try and
clean up this place.

07:12.758 --> 07:13.655
Hmmm.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.137
It sounds like a classic
boiler room fraud.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.758
Isn't that reserved for like
multi-million dollar cons?

07:24.758 --> 07:26.551
Maybe Bruce wasn't
the only mark.

07:26.551 --> 07:28.482
Okay so what's
our next move?

07:28.482 --> 07:29.793
Well I was thinking

07:29.793 --> 07:31.310
you and I could go check out the
former Sable Organic Solutions-

07:31.310 --> 07:32.206
see what we
could find?

07:32.206 --> 07:33.620
Okay I'll contact
the building owner-

07:33.620 --> 07:36.068
see if I can get names
of the old tenants.

07:36.896 --> 07:37.724
We'll find them Charlie.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.896
Yeah don't worry.

07:38.896 --> 07:40.482
Nobody messes with Aunt
Miranda and gets away with it.

07:42.482 --> 07:43.172
Yeah.

07:43.172 --> 07:43.827
Thanks.

07:43.827 --> 07:44.482
Okay, let's go.

07:44.482 --> 07:45.344
Yeah.

07:45.344 --> 07:46.000
Come on pal.

07:48.241 --> 07:49.793
Ah, Superintendant.

07:49.793 --> 07:51.034
I was just coming
to see you.

07:51.034 --> 07:53.793
There is a great interview
with Rufus Fuller in here.

07:53.793 --> 07:55.551
Check it out.

07:55.551 --> 07:57.551
The last remaining
member of the Liberties.

07:57.551 --> 07:58.275
Yeah!

07:58.275 --> 07:59.379
I knew you'd
appreciate it.

08:00.241 --> 08:01.517
I do!

08:02.448 --> 08:03.586
As long as
you don't think

08:03.586 --> 08:05.655
this being nice act is going
to make me drop my guard-

08:05.655 --> 08:07.965
and make me not compete
for the Chief's job.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.793
Do I look worried?

08:11.448 --> 08:13.586
And who said
this was an act?

08:16.655 --> 08:18.103
Look I should
get going.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.482
Have you heard
Rufus's solo album?

08:25.379 --> 08:26.896
He had a
solo album?

08:27.931 --> 08:29.482
I guess you don't know
as much about Rufus

08:29.482 --> 08:30.620
as I thought
you did.

08:31.620 --> 08:32.413
You should come by

08:32.413 --> 08:33.310
my office
some time.

08:33.310 --> 08:34.379
I'll spin
it for you.

08:34.379 --> 08:35.413
Wait.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.827
You still have
a turntable?

08:39.137 --> 08:41.586
That's more of
a turn of phrase.

08:42.586 --> 08:45.206
That you do have.

08:54.586 --> 08:55.413
Charlie?

08:56.068 --> 08:56.965
How's it going?

08:56.965 --> 08:58.344
Did you find anything?

08:58.344 --> 09:00.586
You mean other than
squatters and skateboarders?

09:00.586 --> 09:02.034
No, nothing.

09:02.034 --> 09:04.344
Ah they must've been
using that space illegally.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.034
Why would
you say that?

09:07.034 --> 09:08.586
Well I talked to
the owner in Florida.

09:08.586 --> 09:10.655
He hasn't leased that
building in over two years.

09:10.655 --> 09:12.137
So Buckston was lying.

09:13.551 --> 09:14.862
Aunt Miranda was right.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.620
He is involved
in this somehow.

09:33.724 --> 09:34.689
Bruce Buckston?

09:40.344 --> 09:40.965
Detective Hudson.

09:40.965 --> 09:41.655
Open up!

10:25.241 --> 10:26.448
Good thinking, pal.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.689
Buckston!

10:33.068 --> 10:34.310
If you're in here,
let me know.

10:34.310 --> 10:35.655
I have a warrant
for your arrest.

11:00.689 --> 11:03.275
He was killed within
the last four hours.

11:03.275 --> 11:05.551
Puncture wounds suggest
a piercing weapon.

11:05.551 --> 11:07.206
Not a blade though.

11:07.310 --> 11:09.034
When we were
here earlier-

11:09.034 --> 11:10.689
there was a laptop
on that table.

11:10.689 --> 11:11.896
No sign of it
in our sweep.

11:14.862 --> 11:17.517
He was interested in that
last time we were here too.

11:22.241 --> 11:23.793
Let's take a
look, shall we?

11:27.034 --> 11:28.448
A hidden drawer.

11:30.275 --> 11:32.448
Strange place
for a USB drive.

11:32.448 --> 11:35.586
Something tells me there's
some important stuff on here.

11:39.344 --> 11:43.103
You know, I hate
to say it, but-

11:43.103 --> 11:45.137
Miranda's DNA will show
up in our forensics sweep.

11:45.137 --> 11:46.482
Only because she
was here yesterday.

11:46.482 --> 11:47.689
I know.

11:47.689 --> 11:49.551
It would be
clever though.

11:49.551 --> 11:50.862
Stage a break-in-

11:50.862 --> 11:53.310
to cover up for the fact that
her DNA is at the crime scene?

11:53.310 --> 11:55.758
It sounds like a plot in
one of her mystery novels.

11:59.965 --> 12:01.103
He's dead?

12:02.413 --> 12:05.172
Not much of a chance on seeing
our money again now is there?

12:05.172 --> 12:06.068
This is all
your fault.

12:06.068 --> 12:07.379
I believed you.

12:07.379 --> 12:08.655
Now I get to
work forever!

12:08.655 --> 12:11.344
Your eyes were open
when you made the choice.

12:11.344 --> 12:12.586
Yeah?

12:12.586 --> 12:14.827
Well don't come to me when
your hot water stops working!

12:17.965 --> 12:19.344
Can you and I have
a word privately?

12:20.172 --> 12:21.482
There's nothing to say-

12:21.482 --> 12:23.413
that can't be discussed
with all of us.

12:23.413 --> 12:25.310
We are all in
this together.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.793
All right.

12:27.275 --> 12:30.896
I was just curious as to
what led you to believe

12:30.896 --> 12:32.827
that Bruce was
involved in the fraud.

12:32.827 --> 12:35.448
I was right,
wasn't I?

12:35.448 --> 12:36.620
No way.

12:36.620 --> 12:38.482
Bruce is an
honest man.

12:38.482 --> 12:40.586
I thought you said
he was having an affair

12:40.586 --> 12:41.965
with a married woman!

12:41.965 --> 12:43.344
What's that got to
do with anything?

12:43.344 --> 12:45.172
He was always honest
with business.

12:50.551 --> 12:51.931
Are you
expecting someone?

12:54.310 --> 12:56.000
That'll be my
stepson Kevin.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.931
He's dropping by to
take me to the eye doctor.

12:57.931 --> 12:59.068
I didn't hear
a doorbell.

12:59.068 --> 13:02.000
No need for
one when Rex is over!

13:04.517 --> 13:05.586
Oh.

13:07.344 --> 13:08.793
You're late again.

13:08.793 --> 13:11.206
Traffic was really bad.

13:11.206 --> 13:12.137
We should hurry.

13:12.137 --> 13:13.137
Yeah okay.

13:13.241 --> 13:14.275
Come on.

13:14.758 --> 13:15.655
Thank you.

13:15.655 --> 13:16.517
Miranda. Bye now!

13:16.517 --> 13:17.206
Bye!

13:17.206 --> 13:18.000
Thanks.

13:22.103 --> 13:23.620
Well Rex and
I should be going too.

13:23.620 --> 13:25.896
But before I go-

13:25.896 --> 13:27.793
You didn't leave the
house today, did you?

13:30.931 --> 13:32.000
You've got to
be kidding me.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.137
One quick trip
to the library.

13:34.137 --> 13:37.310
I wanted to do some research
on investment fraud.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.379
That is what the
internet is for.

13:39.379 --> 13:41.517
You're under house arrest
for your own protection.

13:41.517 --> 13:43.206
I don't need protecting!

13:43.206 --> 13:44.724
Please please.

13:44.724 --> 13:47.379
Let my team
handle this okay?

13:48.827 --> 13:50.241
There's a good boy.

13:50.517 --> 13:52.724
Ooh nice kisses!

13:53.689 --> 13:54.517
Rex.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.103
Really undercutting
my authority here, pal.

14:08.241 --> 14:09.206
Sarah hey.

14:09.206 --> 14:10.448
These were on the thumb
drive that Rex found.

14:15.517 --> 14:16.758
Is there
anything else?

14:16.758 --> 14:18.379
I don't think I
need anything else.

14:18.379 --> 14:19.379
What do you mean?

14:19.379 --> 14:20.275
Well Charlie told me

14:20.275 --> 14:22.068
that one of Aunt
Miranda's friends said

14:22.068 --> 14:22.931
Bruce was
having an affair-

14:22.931 --> 14:23.896
with a married woman-

14:23.896 --> 14:25.310
which could be
blackmail material.

14:25.310 --> 14:26.586
And I think these
confirm it.

14:26.586 --> 14:29.413
Oh so Bruce was being forced to
participate against his will.

14:29.413 --> 14:30.724
It's possible.

14:32.275 --> 14:33.413
Who's the woman?

14:33.413 --> 14:34.413
I thought you'd
never ask.

14:34.413 --> 14:35.206
So-

14:35.206 --> 14:36.172
these photos were taken-

14:36.172 --> 14:37.379
in the back of
a downtown bank.

14:37.379 --> 14:38.206
I did some digging.

14:38.206 --> 14:39.310
It turns out
this woman

14:39.310 --> 14:40.551
is Assistant Branch Manager

14:40.551 --> 14:43.000
Petra Davies.

14:47.896 --> 14:49.275
Who took these?

14:49.275 --> 14:52.241
I was hoping you could
help me with that.

14:52.241 --> 14:53.172
I have no idea!

14:53.172 --> 14:54.620
I've never seen
them before!

14:57.206 --> 14:59.793
Although it does
explain something.

14:59.793 --> 15:01.103
What's that?

15:02.103 --> 15:04.344
About three weeks ago,
Bruce ended things with me.

15:05.655 --> 15:06.793
Seeing this-

15:06.793 --> 15:09.620
I realize he must have
done that to protect me.

15:10.586 --> 15:12.103
Had you seen
Bruce recently?

15:13.068 --> 15:15.413
Not since right after
he ended things.

15:15.413 --> 15:18.620
I went to his house
to talk to him.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.172
I was going to tell him I would
leave my husband for him.

15:22.413 --> 15:23.310
And what
did he say?

15:24.517 --> 15:26.310
He wouldn't
let me in.

15:26.310 --> 15:29.344
He said he was
with a client.

15:29.344 --> 15:31.275
And that he never
wanted to see me again.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Is there anything else
that you can recall?

15:46.344 --> 15:48.862
So he was being
blackmailed?

15:48.862 --> 15:50.172
Looks like.

15:50.172 --> 15:50.931
Hmm!

15:50.931 --> 15:53.000
And he paid off
the blackmailer

15:53.000 --> 15:54.034
with our money.

15:54.034 --> 15:55.655
Oh don't be
thick, George.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.620
If he paid off the blackmailers
why would he be dead?

15:58.620 --> 16:01.206
He got a
look at something!

16:01.206 --> 16:01.931
He knew too much!

16:01.931 --> 16:02.896
I don't know!

16:02.896 --> 16:04.103
This kind of stuff
happens all the time!

16:04.655 --> 16:06.034
Ain't that right Detective?

16:06.965 --> 16:07.620
Hmm?

16:07.620 --> 16:08.793
Um-

16:09.896 --> 16:11.068
Rex what
have you got?

16:13.034 --> 16:16.551
That is not
the snack cupboard Rex!

16:16.551 --> 16:17.724
Don't you ever feed

16:17.724 --> 16:19.344
that dog of
yours, Charlie?

16:19.344 --> 16:21.379
I lost at least seven
shoes to my dog, buddy.

16:21.379 --> 16:22.275
You gotta feed them.

16:22.275 --> 16:23.517
He's a K9 officer.

16:23.517 --> 16:24.758
He's not looking
for a snack.

16:24.758 --> 16:25.931
My knitting needle!

16:25.931 --> 16:27.482
I've been looking
everywhere for that!

16:30.413 --> 16:31.103
Oh!

16:37.551 --> 16:38.482
Oh!

16:39.172 --> 16:40.551
Why is their
blood on it?

16:52.068 --> 16:53.586
How did the weapon
that killed Bruce Buckston

16:53.586 --> 16:54.482
end up in
your house?

16:54.482 --> 16:55.793
For heaven's sake,
I don't know!

16:55.793 --> 16:58.586
But nobody hides a murder
weapon in their own home!

16:58.586 --> 17:00.551
It's not just the
weapon Miranda.

17:00.551 --> 17:02.655
You broke into his
house before he died.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.793
And you also
have no alibi

17:03.793 --> 17:04.965
for the time
of the murder!

17:04.965 --> 17:05.896
Should I go on?

17:05.896 --> 17:09.758
You can't possibly
believe that I did this.

17:09.758 --> 17:10.827
Charlie?

17:10.827 --> 17:12.517
No of course not.

17:12.517 --> 17:14.413
But look if this is
going to go to a trial

17:14.413 --> 17:16.689
I wouldn't count on a jury
coming to that same conclusion.

17:16.689 --> 17:17.965
And to
avoid that possibility-

17:17.965 --> 17:20.413
we need to prove that
you're being framed.

17:20.413 --> 17:22.724
Is there anyone else who
has access to your house?

17:22.724 --> 17:24.206
Um-

17:24.206 --> 17:26.724
Well George and Cloris
have spare keys.

17:26.724 --> 17:29.103
As do a few other close
friends in the complex.

17:29.103 --> 17:30.965
But to be honest

17:30.965 --> 17:33.827
I rarely bother to lock
my door when I'm out.

17:33.827 --> 17:36.000
I mean I don't have
anything worth stealing.

17:36.000 --> 17:36.724
Okay, we're off-

17:36.724 --> 17:37.793
to a great start.

17:37.793 --> 17:39.068
What did I tell you about
locking your doors?

17:39.068 --> 17:40.896
So what now?

17:40.896 --> 17:43.241
I'm under arrest for
being a good neighbour?

17:43.241 --> 17:44.172
House arrest.

17:44.172 --> 17:45.827
But for real
this time.

17:45.827 --> 17:48.758
Yes, you have to wear a
GPS tracker at all times.

17:48.758 --> 17:50.448
Let me see
your wrist.

17:51.724 --> 17:52.586
If you take
this off-

17:52.586 --> 17:53.827
an alarm will sound.

17:53.827 --> 17:55.413
If you leave
the property-

17:55.413 --> 17:56.931
same thing.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.620
And we'll
have no choice

17:58.620 --> 18:00.172
but to formally
arrest you.

18:00.172 --> 18:03.793
Well can I at least
go to my yoga class?

18:03.793 --> 18:04.482
We meet

18:04.482 --> 18:05.758
at the community centre

18:05.758 --> 18:07.172
just down the road
from my place.

18:07.172 --> 18:08.586
Oh as long as
it's just for yoga.

18:08.586 --> 18:09.310
No, okay?

18:09.310 --> 18:10.000
And you're not

18:10.000 --> 18:10.862
staying at your house.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.068
Then where?

18:16.793 --> 18:17.758
Come on.

18:17.758 --> 18:18.448
Ahh!

18:18.448 --> 18:20.448
This place looks better!

18:20.896 --> 18:21.724
Better?

18:22.068 --> 18:22.827
How?

18:22.827 --> 18:25.000
Yeah it finally
looks like a home.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.965
Not just a place where
you keep your things.

18:27.965 --> 18:28.620
Huh.

18:28.620 --> 18:29.379
Yeah.

18:29.379 --> 18:30.724
Well Rex and I
have got to go.

18:30.724 --> 18:32.689
So if you need
anything, you ask Jesse.

18:32.689 --> 18:34.620
I don't need
a babysitter.

18:34.620 --> 18:36.241
No offense, Jesse.

18:36.241 --> 18:37.103
None taken.

18:38.172 --> 18:40.793
Oh, that'll be
George and Cloris.

18:40.793 --> 18:42.551
I called them

18:42.551 --> 18:44.482
while you were taking
Rex for his constitutional.

18:44.482 --> 18:46.241
Aunt Miranda.

18:46.241 --> 18:50.517
What part of house arrest are
you not understanding here?

18:50.517 --> 18:53.551
You said I can't
go anywhere.

18:53.551 --> 18:56.137
You didn't say anything
about having guests.

18:57.068 --> 18:59.689
And I would go stir
crazy without them!

18:59.689 --> 19:01.172
Please, they won't
be any bother.

19:01.965 --> 19:03.379
Oh, hi.

19:03.379 --> 19:04.896
Hi.
Come on in.

19:04.896 --> 19:05.827
Well if that's
the case-

19:05.827 --> 19:07.793
I will order some
lunch for everybody!

19:07.793 --> 19:08.827
Mmmm!

19:09.413 --> 19:10.517
Come on.

19:12.724 --> 19:14.689
So, I'm here.

19:15.379 --> 19:16.517
Give it to me.

19:17.103 --> 19:17.724
I'm sorry?

19:17.724 --> 19:20.034
My dose of
Rufus Fuller.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.379
If it even exists.

19:21.379 --> 19:24.137
I mean because I checked all the
music steaming sites, right?

19:24.137 --> 19:24.931
And I don't know.

19:24.931 --> 19:25.896
It exists.

19:26.586 --> 19:27.379
Believe me.

19:27.482 --> 19:28.758
My daughter

19:28.758 --> 19:29.862
digitized an old LP

19:29.862 --> 19:31.551

I didn't say that.

19:51.965 --> 19:53.724
I just-

19:53.724 --> 19:55.896
He doesn't sound
the same flying solo.

19:55.896 --> 19:57.517
Mmmm.

20:25.275 --> 20:27.413

20:27.413 --> 20:30.241
I believe that Bruce was
approached from behind.

20:30.241 --> 20:33.379
Pulled back with an arm around
his neck to expose his chest.

20:33.379 --> 20:36.137
And then stabbed
three times.

20:36.137 --> 20:37.517
Well that would have
taken some strength-

20:37.517 --> 20:39.827
even with the
element of surprise.

20:39.827 --> 20:41.827
The first stab
was the deepest-

20:41.827 --> 20:43.172
puncturing
the left lung.

20:43.172 --> 20:45.896
The next two struck
the chest plate.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.931
Angle of entry on
all three wounds

20:47.931 --> 20:51.000
suggests the killer
was at least five-nine.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.965
That would eliminate
Charlie's aunt.

20:52.965 --> 20:54.310
But if she wasn't
working alone-

20:54.310 --> 20:57.724
her friend George
is the right height.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.275
Well there's no prints
on the knitting needle.

21:00.275 --> 21:02.793
But it might be worth
getting prints

21:02.793 --> 21:05.655
to match the partial
on the thumb drive.

21:06.758 --> 21:09.862
George is decamped
with Cloris and Miranda

21:09.862 --> 21:11.310
at Charlie's place.

21:12.413 --> 21:13.448
I'll see what
Jesse can do.

21:15.103 --> 21:18.172
There must be
something we could do.

21:18.172 --> 21:19.689
Like what?

21:19.689 --> 21:21.275
We ain't getting
our money back.

21:21.275 --> 21:22.551
The damned man's dead.

21:22.551 --> 21:26.482
Let's just give Charlie
time to figure this out.

21:26.482 --> 21:28.586
But if he doesn't make
any headway soon

21:28.586 --> 21:29.689
then I'm going
to take-

21:30.758 --> 21:31.965
Oh, hello Jesse.

21:31.965 --> 21:33.103
Oh this looks delicious!

21:33.103 --> 21:34.620
Well Casa Mia

21:34.620 --> 21:35.896
never disappoints!

21:35.896 --> 21:36.551
Ah!

21:36.551 --> 21:37.862
Instant Italian.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.689
Cloris I will be right
back with yours.

21:39.689 --> 21:40.620
Who would like
some wine?

21:40.620 --> 21:41.586
Ooh, that would
be lovely!

21:41.586 --> 21:43.034
Thank you!

21:44.793 --> 21:46.034
Things are looking up.

21:46.137 --> 21:47.172
Like
I was saying-

21:47.172 --> 21:50.275
I'm going to take matters
into my own hands

21:50.275 --> 21:52.241
if Charie doesn't
act fast!

21:52.241 --> 21:53.034
Oh?

21:53.896 --> 21:55.793
And how are you
planning on doing that?

21:57.310 --> 22:00.413
He seems
like a nice boy!

22:10.379 --> 22:11.413
Have you
got something pal?

22:13.655 --> 22:15.172
Maybe he's
not a fan.

22:15.172 --> 22:17.655
Yeah unless he
found something

22:17.655 --> 22:20.827
on this picture he
doesn't like the scent of.

22:20.827 --> 22:21.551
Sarah.

22:24.034 --> 22:24.896
Look at this.

22:27.172 --> 22:28.344
A listening device?

22:35.689 --> 22:36.655
Whoever planted that there

22:36.655 --> 22:38.689
must have also planted
the knitting needle.

22:38.689 --> 22:41.172
Well now they likely
know that we know.

22:41.172 --> 22:42.413
George?

22:42.413 --> 22:43.793
No I doubt it.

22:43.793 --> 22:47.655
His print isn't a match to
the partial on the thumb drive.

22:50.000 --> 22:51.586
Do you have an
extra evidence bag?

22:51.586 --> 22:52.241
Yeah.

22:52.241 --> 22:53.206
Yeah?

22:55.000 --> 22:57.655
Can you tell Jesse
about this?

22:57.655 --> 23:00.586
And I've just got somebody
I need to talk to.

23:00.586 --> 23:01.689
Okay.

23:22.413 --> 23:23.344
Hey.

23:24.620 --> 23:25.482
Excuse me.

23:25.482 --> 23:26.379
You got a minute?

23:26.379 --> 23:27.103
Sure.

23:27.413 --> 23:28.206
What's up?

23:29.413 --> 23:31.586
How much money did you give
to Miranda to invest with?

23:31.586 --> 23:33.034
Ten thousand dollars.

23:33.034 --> 23:34.620
It might not seem
like a lot to you.

23:34.620 --> 23:36.068
No that seems
like a lot to me.

23:36.068 --> 23:38.379
So Bruce Buxton must not
be your favourite person.

23:38.379 --> 23:39.862
Of course not.

23:39.862 --> 23:42.896
Given that you do maintenance
in the neighbourhood-

23:42.896 --> 23:45.344
you probably have
access to all the units.

23:45.344 --> 23:46.379
Yeah.

23:46.379 --> 23:48.137
You recognize this?

23:48.137 --> 23:49.517
What the heck's that?

23:49.517 --> 23:50.620
It's a listening device.

23:51.517 --> 23:52.758
I found it in
Miranda's place.

23:53.275 --> 23:54.172
Huh.

23:55.103 --> 23:56.275
What about this?

23:59.793 --> 24:01.034
It's a knitting needle?

24:02.862 --> 24:03.689
Wait.

24:03.689 --> 24:04.758
Is that blood
on it?

24:05.965 --> 24:07.827
Your aunt killed
Bruce Buckston with it?

24:07.827 --> 24:08.655
Good for her.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.413
Or maybe you did.

24:09.413 --> 24:10.275
And you planted
it there.

24:10.275 --> 24:11.689
If I was going
to kill a man-

24:11.689 --> 24:14.551
there's a lot better
ways to do it.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.827
Now if you
don't mind-

24:17.827 --> 24:19.379
I'm finished
for the day.

24:29.379 --> 24:32.758
Okay come on,
come on.

24:32.758 --> 24:33.965
Aha!

24:33.965 --> 24:36.448
Looks like
Sarah was right.

24:42.724 --> 24:43.448
George.

24:43.448 --> 24:44.862
Where's Miranda?

24:44.862 --> 24:47.310
Oh, her and Cloris
went out somewhere.

24:47.310 --> 24:48.517
Uh- where?

24:48.517 --> 24:49.620
I'm not their dad.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.344
They can't do that!

24:51.344 --> 24:52.586
Well they did.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.448
We said the corner
of Taylor and Chase.

25:09.448 --> 25:12.241
And he said five minutes,
five minutes ago.

25:13.310 --> 25:15.862
I swear, that boy will be
late to his own funeral.

25:15.862 --> 25:17.482
Oh, they just
don't concentrate.

25:17.482 --> 25:18.172
That's the problem.

25:18.172 --> 25:19.034
Yeah, yeah.

25:19.034 --> 25:21.482
Thanks for
waiting with me.

25:21.482 --> 25:22.655
Oh of course!

25:22.655 --> 25:24.965
Hopefully the doctor will have
some good news for you.

25:24.965 --> 25:25.620
Ah!

25:25.620 --> 25:26.551
That would
be a first.

25:28.655 --> 25:29.310
Oh!

25:29.310 --> 25:30.689
Is that Kevin now?

25:31.724 --> 25:32.689
No, that's
not his car.

25:33.379 --> 25:34.862
What's that lunatic-?

25:34.862 --> 25:35.517
Look out!

25:39.310 --> 25:40.000
Hey!

25:40.000 --> 25:40.758
Hey hey hey!

25:40.758 --> 25:41.517
Are you okay?

25:44.206 --> 25:44.896
I think so.

25:44.896 --> 25:45.551
Cloris?

25:46.241 --> 25:47.206
Cloris?

25:47.206 --> 25:48.103
Let
me help you.

25:48.103 --> 25:49.206
I'll live.

26:00.689 --> 26:01.551
Hey.

26:01.551 --> 26:02.793
What happened?

26:02.793 --> 26:04.931
We've got an attempted
hit and run.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.241
It's a grey sedan.

26:06.241 --> 26:07.931
Uniforms are already
having a look.

26:07.931 --> 26:09.965
That can't be
a coincidence.

26:09.965 --> 26:12.206
Looks like you escaped
with a few bruises.

26:12.206 --> 26:15.517
But I suggest we take you
to the hospital for x-rays

26:15.517 --> 26:16.931
just to be safe.

26:16.931 --> 26:19.448
I'm fine.

26:19.448 --> 26:22.103
These days I bruise when
I roll over in my sleep.

26:22.103 --> 26:24.689
A few more isn't
going to slow me down.

26:25.586 --> 26:27.793
I'll keep an
eye on her.

26:27.793 --> 26:29.689
Uni's
did their job.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.379
The stolen car was found
on a residential lane

26:31.379 --> 26:32.965
near your place, Charlie.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.206
They found you because of the
bug that was in your phone case.

26:37.206 --> 26:39.344
They overheard you tell the
address to your friends.

26:40.413 --> 26:42.965
To think someone was
listening in on my life.

26:42.965 --> 26:44.413
That is disturbing.

26:44.413 --> 26:46.137
Yeah I'll have Jesse do
a sweep of your place

26:46.137 --> 26:48.241
to make sure there's no
more listening devices.

26:50.448 --> 26:51.310
Hello?

26:51.551 --> 26:52.206
Oh!

26:52.206 --> 26:53.551
Oh Kevin.

26:53.551 --> 26:56.344
No, I'm all
right, dear.

26:56.344 --> 27:00.724
I'm just giving a
statement to the police.

27:00.724 --> 27:02.379
Hmm?

27:02.379 --> 27:03.310
Oh I don't know.

27:03.310 --> 27:04.000
Hold on.

27:04.000 --> 27:04.827
Um-

27:04.827 --> 27:06.724
My stepson is
waiting downstairs.

27:06.724 --> 27:08.275
He wants to know
when I can be released.

27:09.413 --> 27:11.172
It's going to be a
little while longer.

27:11.172 --> 27:12.482
We're going to need
your official statement

27:12.482 --> 27:13.655
about the
hit and run.

27:13.655 --> 27:14.724
Oh.

27:14.724 --> 27:16.241
They're not done
with me yet.

27:16.241 --> 27:18.310
I'll call you
when I'm ready.

27:21.137 --> 27:22.689
What I don't understand-

27:22.689 --> 27:23.862
is why someone
would try

27:23.862 --> 27:25.827
to frame me
for the murder-

27:25.827 --> 27:27.310
and then try
to kill me!

27:27.310 --> 27:29.344
Maybe they're panicking.

27:29.344 --> 27:31.862
If they know we aren't
buying the frame job-

27:33.034 --> 27:33.655
Guys.

27:33.655 --> 27:34.793
Guys, I found something.

27:37.965 --> 27:40.965
Finally able to hack into Bruce
Buckston's ICloud account.

27:40.965 --> 27:43.551
He has a few meetings
set up with N.S.

27:43.551 --> 27:44.586
It could be
Nick Sable.

27:44.586 --> 27:47.793
That's the date that
Bruce's girlfriend, Petra-

27:47.793 --> 27:49.551
came to confront him.

27:49.551 --> 27:52.068
She said she saw
Bruce with a client.

27:52.068 --> 27:54.827
How good a look
did she get?

27:54.827 --> 27:55.965
Let's find out.

28:01.310 --> 28:02.068
Hi Petra.

28:02.068 --> 28:03.068
Thanks for coming back.

28:03.068 --> 28:04.206
Happy to help.

28:04.206 --> 28:07.068
We're trying to identify
the client you saw at Bruce's

28:07.068 --> 28:08.551
when you were
there last.

28:08.551 --> 28:10.448
Would you be up for sitting
with a composite artist?

28:10.448 --> 28:12.000
Of course.

28:13.206 --> 28:15.344
Although I'm not sure
that's going to be necessary.

28:16.103 --> 28:18.413
She's sitting right there.

28:18.517 --> 28:19.103
No Cloris.

28:19.103 --> 28:20.379
That was no accident.

28:20.379 --> 28:22.103
Are you sure?

28:22.586 --> 28:23.862
There's no doubt
in my mind.

28:23.862 --> 28:25.551
That is who
was with Bruce.

28:26.413 --> 28:27.517
We
couldn't get a look.

28:29.034 --> 28:30.206
Oh, I guess.

28:30.206 --> 28:33.655
But I just
don't know!

28:33.655 --> 28:35.241
Everything just
happened so quickly!

28:38.586 --> 28:39.310
You're telling me

28:39.310 --> 28:40.965
you've never met
Bruce Buckston

28:40.965 --> 28:42.344
face to face?

28:42.344 --> 28:45.241
Not that I remember.

28:45.241 --> 28:47.275
We have an eye
witness who says

28:47.275 --> 28:49.896
that they saw you in
Bruce Buckston's office

28:49.896 --> 28:51.862
just a few days before
he was murdered.

28:52.862 --> 28:54.551
Okay.

28:54.551 --> 28:55.896
Fine, yes.

28:55.896 --> 28:57.586
I was there.

28:57.586 --> 28:58.827
I admit it.

28:58.827 --> 29:01.000
The name Nick Sable
mean anything to you?

29:02.724 --> 29:04.206
No!

29:04.206 --> 29:05.206
I don't
think so.

29:05.206 --> 29:06.137
Why?

29:06.137 --> 29:08.689
The person behind
Sable Organic Solutions.

29:08.689 --> 29:11.068
You would have read his name
in the investment portfolio.

29:13.206 --> 29:14.620
Uh-

29:15.827 --> 29:17.310
I'm not sure.

29:18.482 --> 29:19.827
Cloris.

29:21.275 --> 29:22.827
Bruce Buckston was supposed
to meet with a man

29:22.827 --> 29:24.448
with the initials N.S.

29:24.448 --> 29:26.137
at the time that you
were in his office.

29:27.758 --> 29:30.793
I was the only
one there!

29:30.793 --> 29:33.310
But I remember-

29:33.310 --> 29:35.689
Bruce said he'd
had a cancellation.

29:35.689 --> 29:37.413
And that's why
he could see me.

29:38.172 --> 29:39.344
What was the
meeting about?

29:40.379 --> 29:41.517
Well I-

29:43.103 --> 29:48.689
I tried to withdraw my
portion of the investment.

29:48.689 --> 29:50.586
I only have a
small pension.

29:50.586 --> 29:52.310
And I was worried something

29:52.310 --> 29:54.000
might go wrong.

29:55.275 --> 29:58.517
I was too embarrassed to
tell Miranda and George.

30:01.862 --> 30:03.931
How did Bruce respond
to that request?

30:06.000 --> 30:07.862
He said it
was too late.

30:07.862 --> 30:09.724
He'd already
transferred the funds.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.448
There was nothing
he could do.

30:12.413 --> 30:15.137
And you never tried to
contact Buckston again

30:15.137 --> 30:16.620
after you found out
you were scammed?

30:16.620 --> 30:19.344
No, that was the
first and last time

30:19.344 --> 30:21.310
I talked to him
in person.

30:28.931 --> 30:30.103
Hey.

30:30.103 --> 30:31.000
Hey!

30:31.000 --> 30:35.103
I got your invitation
for dinner.

30:35.103 --> 30:35.965
Thank you.

30:35.965 --> 30:37.034
Of course.

30:37.034 --> 30:38.586
I just-

30:38.586 --> 30:40.413
I don't think it's going
to be a good idea-

30:40.413 --> 30:42.137
you know- professionally.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.413
Well we're both
on the same level.

30:46.413 --> 30:48.137
Different departments.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.655
It's not against policy.

30:49.655 --> 30:51.275
Well I mean-

30:51.275 --> 30:53.827
we're on the same
level for now.

30:53.827 --> 30:55.137
But things could
get a little tricky

30:55.137 --> 30:57.310
when the competition for
Chief starts heating up.

30:58.206 --> 31:00.206
And I don't intend
on catching feelings

31:00.206 --> 31:02.586
and throwing the competition.

31:02.586 --> 31:03.965
That's good.

31:05.206 --> 31:06.586
Because neither do I.

31:08.172 --> 31:09.413
And the job hasn't
been posted yet.

31:09.413 --> 31:11.068
So technically it's
still a rumour.

31:11.068 --> 31:15.034
So maybe if you go
to dinner with me-

31:15.034 --> 31:15.689
who knows?

31:15.689 --> 31:16.724
I slip up.

31:16.724 --> 31:18.862
Give you something
you can use against me.

31:22.241 --> 31:23.758
Promise?

31:33.551 --> 31:35.448
Oh that's interesting!

31:35.448 --> 31:36.896
It says here that Kevin's
father, Walter Donner

31:38.862 --> 31:40.413
lived in the same neighbourhood
as the Nick Sable

31:40.413 --> 31:43.068
that died in
a car accident

31:43.068 --> 31:45.241
And it looks like Kevin and
Nick were around the same age.

31:45.241 --> 31:46.310
Sarah.

31:48.241 --> 31:49.103
Everything okay?

31:49.103 --> 31:51.103
You tell me.

31:51.103 --> 31:53.758
Where did Charlie
take Cloris?

31:54.413 --> 31:56.172
He just had
some questions

31:56.172 --> 31:57.586
about her statement
he wanted to go over.

31:57.586 --> 31:58.689
I'm sure they
won't be long.

31:58.689 --> 31:59.931
Ah.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.310
Would you be a dear
and get me some water?

32:04.310 --> 32:05.517
Of course.

32:05.517 --> 32:06.482
I'll be right back.

32:06.482 --> 32:08.413
Thanks.

32:19.724 --> 32:20.758
Stay Rex, stay.

32:23.793 --> 32:25.482
Good boy.

32:37.551 --> 32:38.206
Oh Miranda.

32:38.206 --> 32:39.206
Oh!
- Hi.

32:39.206 --> 32:40.517
Kevin!

32:40.517 --> 32:41.310
I thought you'd left.

32:41.310 --> 32:42.068
Oh no.

32:42.068 --> 32:43.275
I had time left
on my parking.

32:43.275 --> 32:45.137
So I figured I'd stick around
in case they release her.

32:45.137 --> 32:46.034
Is she coming?

32:46.034 --> 32:47.862
No she's still in
with the detectives.

32:47.862 --> 32:48.793
I see.

32:48.793 --> 32:50.344
Well can I give
you a ride home?

32:50.344 --> 32:51.344
That's sweet of you.

32:51.344 --> 32:52.379
But I can
get a cab.

32:52.379 --> 32:53.310
Oh hey,
don't be silly.

32:53.310 --> 32:54.965
Look you
live so close.

32:54.965 --> 32:56.034
Okay I'll just
drive you over.

32:56.034 --> 32:57.758
And then I'll come
back and get mom.

32:57.758 --> 32:59.551
Please, I insist.

32:59.551 --> 33:00.310
All right.

33:00.310 --> 33:01.034
Thanks.

33:01.034 --> 33:02.241
Let's go.

33:02.241 --> 33:03.206
Okay.

33:05.689 --> 33:06.724
Hey bud.

33:06.724 --> 33:07.379
Charlie.

33:07.379 --> 33:08.896
Hey.

33:08.896 --> 33:10.620
So I was looking into
Cloris's background.

33:10.620 --> 33:12.379
And yeah, there
was a lot to uncover.

33:12.379 --> 33:13.655
Tell me you
found something.

33:13.655 --> 33:15.896
Yeah she was married three times
over the span of thirty years.

33:15.896 --> 33:17.689
Okay she's got three
kids of her own-

33:17.689 --> 33:19.655
two step-kids and
a billion grandchildren.

33:19.655 --> 33:20.413
Hmm.

33:20.413 --> 33:21.482
But it was her
second marriage

33:21.482 --> 33:22.448
to Walter Donner

33:22.448 --> 33:23.448
that sparked my attention.

33:23.448 --> 33:24.448
How so?

33:24.448 --> 33:26.517
Well I cross-referenced
the name Nick Sable

33:26.517 --> 33:27.724
with Cloris's background.

33:27.724 --> 33:29.172
It turns out there
was a Nicolaus Sable

33:29.172 --> 33:31.068
who lived in the same
Montreal neighbourhood

33:31.068 --> 33:33.172
when she was
married to Walt.

33:33.172 --> 33:34.206
Do you have a
contact number?

33:34.206 --> 33:36.517
No, he died in a car
accident in his teens.

33:36.517 --> 33:37.689
Then why is
this relevant?

33:37.689 --> 33:39.241
Walt had a son from
his previous marriage

33:39.241 --> 33:40.655
that went to the same
school as Sable.

33:40.655 --> 33:42.310
They even took a few
classes together.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.241
A son.

33:46.689 --> 33:48.137
You mean Cloris's
stepson Kevin-

33:48.137 --> 33:50.620
is using the name
of his dead classmate.

34:15.586 --> 34:17.965
It's really not necessary
to walk me to the door.

34:17.965 --> 34:19.724
Oh I don't mind.

34:19.724 --> 34:20.517
Okay?

34:20.517 --> 34:21.241
Why are we stopping?

34:21.241 --> 34:22.827
Um- I've changed
my mind.

34:22.827 --> 34:24.241
I'm going to visit
my friend George.

34:24.241 --> 34:25.724
No I think

34:25.724 --> 34:28.206
we should
get you home.

34:28.206 --> 34:29.517
Ah!

34:29.517 --> 34:30.862
We're gonna walk
straight there.

34:30.862 --> 34:33.482
No stopping, no talking.

34:33.482 --> 34:34.206
You got it?

34:34.206 --> 34:35.931
Mmm.

34:35.931 --> 34:36.862
Let's go.

34:43.206 --> 34:44.896
Don't even
think about it.

34:56.379 --> 34:59.862
We know that your stepson Kevin
is using the alias Nick Sable.

35:03.103 --> 35:04.172
Nick Sable!

35:04.758 --> 35:05.758
Oh!

35:09.172 --> 35:11.275
I've never heard that
name before today!

35:11.275 --> 35:12.172
Cloris.

35:12.172 --> 35:13.655
Cloris, if you continue
to protect him-

35:13.655 --> 35:15.206
we are going to charge
you as an accomplice

35:15.206 --> 35:16.103
to all of
his crimes-

35:16.103 --> 35:18.620
including the murder
of Bruce Buckston!

35:20.379 --> 35:23.689
Might I remind you
that I am a victim here?

35:25.517 --> 35:28.793
How could I know
my that own stepson

35:28.793 --> 35:31.379
was using me to
get to my friends?

35:31.379 --> 35:33.517
It's shocking, really!

35:44.586 --> 35:45.551
You know
what I think?

35:45.551 --> 35:47.896
I think that-

35:47.896 --> 35:50.344
we're going to
tie Kevin's prints

35:50.344 --> 35:53.000
back to that car that
almost ran you down.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
And I think that you
were the intended target.

35:58.275 --> 36:00.689
Kevin would never
do anything-

36:00.689 --> 36:02.275
With Bruce gone-

36:02.275 --> 36:05.068
you are the only person
who can tie him to this.

36:06.241 --> 36:07.517
You're a liability.

36:09.275 --> 36:11.724
I told you, I don't
know anything!

36:17.896 --> 36:20.137
Looks like Aunt Miranda
left with Kevin willingly.

36:20.137 --> 36:21.448
When we noticed
she was gone-

36:21.448 --> 36:22.931
I checked the
CCTV footage

36:31.379 --> 36:32.172
When was this?

36:32.172 --> 36:33.344
Seventeen minutes ago.

36:33.344 --> 36:34.620
Can you track
her phone?

36:34.620 --> 36:36.931
No I didn't have the chance to
return it after debugging it.

36:42.862 --> 36:43.724
Wait.

36:43.724 --> 36:45.034
There is way that
we can track her.

36:51.551 --> 36:53.586
Tell me everything
you all told the cops.

36:53.586 --> 36:54.896
Did my name
come up?

36:54.896 --> 36:57.068
I don't think so.

36:57.068 --> 36:59.620
But I see now it
was you all along.

36:59.620 --> 37:03.103
And Cloris was working
with you, wasn't she?

37:03.103 --> 37:05.551
You planned all
of this together.

37:05.655 --> 37:07.517
Got it all
figured out huh?

37:07.517 --> 37:10.137
You blackmailed Bruce.

37:10.137 --> 37:12.241
And then forced
him to play along

37:12.241 --> 37:12.896
with your scheme.

37:12.896 --> 37:14.137
And then-

37:14.137 --> 37:16.827
when you saw that he was the
target of an investigation-

37:16.827 --> 37:19.206
you killed him just
to keep him quiet!

37:20.517 --> 37:22.206
Well that's pretty good.

37:22.206 --> 37:23.551
But you're wrong
about one thing.

37:23.551 --> 37:24.862
What's that?

37:24.862 --> 37:28.137
Batty old Cloris didn't help
me come up with the plan.

37:28.137 --> 37:29.413
She was
just a tool.

37:29.413 --> 37:31.034
She's your mother!

37:31.034 --> 37:32.000
She's my stepmother!

37:32.000 --> 37:33.206
Ooh!

37:33.206 --> 37:34.413
And she's outlived

37:34.413 --> 37:35.758
her usefulness!

37:36.482 --> 37:38.068
And unfortunately,
so have you.

37:38.068 --> 37:40.620
Before you pull
that trigger-

37:40.620 --> 37:42.586
there's something
you should know!

37:42.586 --> 37:43.379
Oh yeah?

37:43.379 --> 37:44.517
What?

37:44.517 --> 37:46.517
I have been stalling

37:46.517 --> 37:50.655
to buy my nephew and his
partner time to get here!

37:52.000 --> 37:52.896
What are you
talking about?

37:54.068 --> 37:55.206
A GPS watch.

37:56.206 --> 37:59.000
I figured when they
realized I was gone-

37:59.000 --> 38:01.310
he'd use it
to track me!

38:01.310 --> 38:04.413
Turns out that house arrest
has some benefits after all!

38:05.551 --> 38:06.379
Oh damn it!

38:12.310 --> 38:13.206
They went
into the house.

38:13.206 --> 38:14.000
Both of them.

38:17.448 --> 38:18.103
What's going on?

38:18.103 --> 38:18.758
Ow!

38:18.758 --> 38:19.551
Ughh!

38:19.896 --> 38:21.137
You'd better not run-

38:21.137 --> 38:22.482
if I were you!

38:30.379 --> 38:31.034
Are you okay?

38:31.034 --> 38:32.034
I'm fine, now
go get him!

38:32.034 --> 38:33.068
What the devil
is going on?

38:33.068 --> 38:34.586
Oh come along George!

38:39.000 --> 38:40.241
Hey hold
on a sec!

38:40.241 --> 38:41.206
And miss all
the fireworks?

38:41.206 --> 38:41.862
Never!

38:41.862 --> 38:42.931
Come on!

39:19.793 --> 39:20.862
Get out
of my way!

39:20.862 --> 39:24.551
This is the most
fun I've had in years!

39:24.551 --> 39:25.517
It's not over yet!

39:25.517 --> 39:26.206
Come on!

39:28.551 --> 39:29.551
Uhhh!

39:46.586 --> 39:47.862
Aghh!

39:48.344 --> 39:49.482
Ughh!

39:50.448 --> 39:51.379
Stay away!

39:52.172 --> 39:52.931
Make way!

39:52.931 --> 39:54.482
SJPD coming through.

39:55.137 --> 39:55.862
Thank you.

39:56.724 --> 39:57.448
No no no!

39:57.448 --> 39:58.655
Good job, partner.

39:59.896 --> 40:00.551
Stay down.

40:00.551 --> 40:01.241
Stay away!

40:04.896 --> 40:06.172
Let's go.

40:07.379 --> 40:08.275
I didn't do anything.

40:08.275 --> 40:09.241
Come on.

40:09.241 --> 40:11.551
Yeah well we have
access to the recordings

40:11.551 --> 40:14.103
from the bugs you left
in Miranda' house.

40:14.103 --> 40:17.103
But I'm sure you didn't say
anything incriminating, huh?

40:17.103 --> 40:18.310
Come on, let's go.

40:20.310 --> 40:22.724
You want to give me a
minute alone with him?

40:22.724 --> 40:23.689
Huh?

40:23.689 --> 40:25.586
Not going to
happen George.

40:33.517 --> 40:34.724
Batty old Cloris
didn't help me

40:34.724 --> 40:36.172
come up
with the plan.

40:36.172 --> 40:38.206
She was
just a tool.

40:38.206 --> 40:39.241
She's
your mother!

40:39.241 --> 40:39.896
She's my stepmother!

40:39.896 --> 40:40.724
Ooh!

40:40.724 --> 40:42.655
And she's outlived
her usefulness!

40:44.586 --> 40:45.965
Kids, huh?

40:45.965 --> 40:48.137
They never seem to
respect their parents.

40:48.137 --> 40:53.137
I played no role
in killing Bruce.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.172
But you're still
looking at prison time

40:56.172 --> 40:58.034
for your involvement
in the fraud.

40:58.034 --> 41:00.137
I don't care what
happens to me-

41:02.172 --> 41:03.620
just as long
as my stepson

41:03.620 --> 41:06.965
never sees the outside
of a cell again.

41:26.034 --> 41:27.172
The good news is

41:27.172 --> 41:28.793
you're going to be able to
get all your back money now.

41:28.793 --> 41:29.931
Thank you.

41:29.931 --> 41:31.862
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me.

41:33.482 --> 41:34.586
By the way-

41:34.586 --> 41:37.551
I love what you've done
with Charlie's place, Sarah.

41:38.965 --> 41:39.620
Sorry what?

41:39.620 --> 41:40.344
Oh.

41:40.344 --> 41:41.965
Keeping it
quiet, are we?

41:42.965 --> 41:45.206
But you can't hide
it from me, dear.

41:45.206 --> 41:48.551
I can tell when my favourite
nephew is in love.

41:54.586 --> 41:56.137
Well, I should
be going.

41:56.137 --> 41:59.551
It's bingo night at
the community centre.

41:59.551 --> 42:03.448
Try and stay out of
trouble for once please?

42:03.448 --> 42:06.172
Now what fun
would that be?

42:17.413 --> 42:20.724
♪I said soul is
what's happening♪

42:20.724 --> 42:22.896
Superintendent.

42:23.000 --> 42:25.758
Superintendent.

42:25.758 --> 42:27.586
Vanessa.

42:27.586 --> 42:28.655
Joe.

42:29.448 --> 42:31.413
You know-

42:31.413 --> 42:32.551
I never mentioned
this but-

42:32.551 --> 42:33.586
I don't go
to this place

42:33.586 --> 42:35.137
unless I'm kicking it
up on the dance floor.

42:35.137 --> 42:36.862
So I hope that's not
going to be a problem.

42:36.862 --> 42:37.827
Oh!

42:37.827 --> 42:39.448
Well I can throw down
on a dance floor.

42:39.448 --> 42:40.310
Don't you worry
about me.

42:40.310 --> 42:41.068
Okay.

42:41.068 --> 42:42.275
Good to know.

42:42.379 --> 42:42.965
Good to know.

42:43.620 --> 42:44.689
Oh.

42:47.517 --> 42:49.689
It's the Chief's job.

42:49.689 --> 42:51.103
It's been posted.

42:52.068 --> 42:53.000
So you want
to cancel?

42:54.517 --> 42:55.172
No.

42:55.172 --> 42:56.241
Do you?

42:57.241 --> 42:58.758
No.

43:03.827 --> 43:04.586
Shall we?
