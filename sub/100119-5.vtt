I mean, the coach wouldn't let us out.

She is. Just a few cuts and bruises.

Your mom...

01:30.480 --> 01:33.440
Mrs. Woods is going with her
to the hospital just for precaution.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.080
-What happened?
-[Carter] Suzanne smelled a leak,

01:36.160 --> 01:38.840
and she got out of the way
just before her engine exploded.

01:38.920 --> 01:41.840
-So, there was a gas leak?
-Yeah.

01:41.920 --> 01:44.520
How can they be sure
someone didn't mess with her car?

01:45.120 --> 01:48.040
No, no, that's crazy.
Who would wanna hurt Suzanne?

01:48.120 --> 01:50.920
Mr. Woods, when is Suzanne expected
to get out of the hospital?

01:51.000 --> 01:53.080
Well, I really can't answer that.
I don't know.

01:53.160 --> 01:54.920
But I'm sure she'll be here very soon.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.280
Did they check to make sure this leak

01:59.360 --> 02:01.000
-wasn't foul play?
-Brooke...

02:01.080 --> 02:02.840
Uh, that's a good question.

02:02.920 --> 02:04.760
But, yes, we've ruled out
that possibility.

-[Alex sighs]

02:06.840 --> 02:09.800
Yes. Thank you, Brooke.

02:09.880 --> 02:10.880
Now it's late.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.440
I suggest you all go to bed. All right?

02:16.960 --> 02:20.440
Oh. [sighs] Just a reminder, guys...

02:20.520 --> 02:24.480
Uh, the Eagles have a big game tomorrow
versus Briarwood Prep.

She's probably happy to get some days off.

But hey, more importantly,
we now have the magnetite,

03:37.240 --> 03:38.080
How's your teacher?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.040
I should be asking you that.

03:41.160 --> 03:43.360
Why? Do you think
I had something to do with it?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.160
Yeah, the thought crossed my mind.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.480
Look, if I had anything to do with it,

03:50.560 --> 03:52.880

I'm gonna tell Ryan
everything I know about you.

No. You won't.

I don't care what you say
about my past, okay?

and they care about who I am now.

-Yeah, thought so.

04:42.640 --> 04:43.960
If you tell anyone,

04:44.520 --> 04:48.920
I'll make his life, and yours,

but I can... I can feed myself.

for us in the clubhouse.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.640
Okay. Great.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.640
[Ryan] I know you lost
your challenge yesterday.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.680
It's just one of many to come.

06:24.760 --> 06:26.760
-You'll bounce back.
-Not without Hayley.

06:27.320 --> 06:31.640
[Ryan] So, I thought I'd bring you
a little something to inspire you.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.320
This is a piece of magnetite.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.240

I'm sure. [chuckles]

Well, if you don't hear from me
in a while,

07:50.360 --> 07:52.960
then I've probably fallen into
one of these bottomless boxes,

07:53.040 --> 07:55.320
so call for help. [chuckles]

08:07.520 --> 08:08.800
Okay.

08:11.080 --> 08:14.920

are pretty lost without you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000

08:16.600 --> 08:17.680
I doubt it.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.040
Though, they did suck
in yesterday's challenge,

08:21.120 --> 08:23.200
but someone's gotta win, right?

08:23.280 --> 08:25.440
[chuckles] Oh, stop it.

08:25.520 --> 08:27.160
You have to go back to your old clubhouse.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.080
You're not serious, right?
We talked about this.

08:31.160 --> 08:33.400
Uh, we didn't, really.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.200
And I found out you never formally applied
to switch houses.

08:37.280 --> 08:38.159
Who told you that? Leo?

08:38.240 --> 08:40.520
Uh, no, actually. Uh, Suzanne.

this was a dictatorship.

to choose where I wanna live.

at the gym today?

Absolutely. Why not?

08:52.480 --> 08:53.920
I'm sorry. I... I don't buy it.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.200
Well, too bad, Mom,
because this is my decision.

08:57.280 --> 08:58.720
I'm just worried about you.

08:59.320 --> 09:02.560
I'm... concerned by your motivations.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.160
Are you doing this
to get back at the Ravens?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.040
At Leo?

09:08.680 --> 09:10.720
Are you upset that he's dating Becca now?

09:10.800 --> 09:12.120
What? No.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.560
I mean, though,
I'm... sure he's kind of upset about it.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.240
[laughs]

09:17.320 --> 09:18.480
[chuckles softly]

09:19.320 --> 09:22.600
This is not over.
I need to think about it.

09:23.800 --> 09:24.880
Thanks, Mom.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.960

with those pom-poms.

-What are you doing?

10:01.680 --> 10:02.680
It's not my fault.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.880
You're the guy who doesn't know
how to use a drill.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.200
Oh, because I'm a guy, I'm supposed to
know how this thing works?

10:07.280 --> 10:08.120

I sort of acted impulsively.

I know! And I'm so glad you did.

How much do you think that
that thing's worth, anyway?

11:26.560 --> 11:29.120
Max, only you would pay that much.

But hundreds of thousands for sure.

11:34.280 --> 11:35.760
Well... [clears throat]
