00:02.001 --> 00:04.587
{\an8}(Kelsey)
It definitely wasn't easy

00:04.671 --> 00:06.256
{\an8}being the new girl
in Siesta Key.

00:06.339 --> 00:07.632
{\an8}(Pauly)
Is this the Kelsey

00:07.716 --> 00:08.717
{\an8}that I've heard
so much about?

00:08.800 --> 00:11.052
{\an8}(Kelsey)
I was trying to fit in
and meet people.

00:11.136 --> 00:12.762
{\an8}What did you say about me?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.848
{\an8}But it took a minute
to figure out who to trust,

00:14.931 --> 00:19.227
{\an8}especially here where drama
is impossible to avoid.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.604
My new friend Chloe
was fighting

00:21.688 --> 00:24.482
with her BFF Amanda
over this guy, Brandon.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.943
{\an5}Like, literally, fighting.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.943
(distant siren blaring)

00:27.026 --> 00:28.570
(Alex)
Oh, my God.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.573
(Kelsey)
Amanda broke Chloe's nose.

00:31.656 --> 00:33.366
{\an3}Oops.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.243
Chloe gets mad
when I talk to you.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.619
We'll have to keep
it on the low then.

00:36.703 --> 00:39.914
{\an5}(Kelsey)
No one knew if those girls
would ever be friends again.

00:39.998 --> 00:43.001
Then there was this guy Alex.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.545
He seemed like Siesta Key's
biggest player.

00:45.628 --> 00:48.173
How many of your friends
haven't been with Alex?

00:48.256 --> 00:49.883
{\an6}Me...

00:48.256 --> 00:49.883
{\an1}Me...

00:49.966 --> 00:50.967
{\an6}And you.

00:49.966 --> 00:50.967
Cheers to that.

00:51.050 --> 00:54.137
I thought
he was with Juliette.

00:54.220 --> 00:57.098
At least that's the impression
I got at his party.

00:57.182 --> 01:00.393
But then Madisson was all over
him at Brandon's bonfire.

01:00.477 --> 01:02.520
{\an1}Go do a little wakeboarding
like we talked about.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.105
{\an5}(Kelsey)
Until he said those
rude things about her.

01:04.188 --> 01:06.816
I used to call
her the bow queen.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.151
{\an4}(bleep)!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.151
(man)
The bow queen!

01:08.234 --> 01:09.819
(Kelsey)
That was not cool.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.196
She's pretty artsy
with it. (laughs)

01:11.279 --> 01:14.783
Of course, no one knew Alex
had been low key texting

01:14.866 --> 01:17.702
and flirting with me.

01:17.786 --> 01:18.912
I felt so weird
about it all.

01:18.995 --> 01:22.457
And I'd never do anything
to hurt my boyfriend Garrett.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.501
He had always
been so sweet to me.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.045
365 handwritten notes.

01:27.128 --> 01:30.089
I just wish he was
a little more outgoing.

01:30.173 --> 01:32.133
But I was starting to wonder
if he wanted more

01:32.217 --> 01:32.842
than I could give him.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.345
{\an1}I think
she could be the one.

01:35.428 --> 01:36.513
And I was about to learn
that Siesta Key

01:36.596 --> 01:42.185
has a way of burning even
the strongest relationships.

{\an1}How was your anniversary
with Garrett?

01:53.321 --> 01:54.531
{\an9}Uh...

01:53.321 --> 01:54.531
{\an7}Oh, God...

01:54.614 --> 01:57.951
{\an7}No, it was good, it was, like,
not what I expected, though.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.577
{\an8}So, what happened?

01:59.661 --> 02:01.871
It's six months, so, I was
expecting to go somewhere.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.872
We're driving.
We passed the Ritz.

02:02.956 --> 02:04.791
I was like, oh, maybe
he'll take me there.

02:04.874 --> 02:06.292
And then, no,
we keep driving down.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.794
We end up on the beach.

02:07.877 --> 02:08.794
He packed, like,

02:08.877 --> 02:12.841
crackers and cheese
and, like, pepperoni.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.384
{\an1}So, you didn't
even have dinner?

02:14.467 --> 02:15.426
{\an3}No.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.637
My God, no, Garrett!

02:17.720 --> 02:21.099
He got me this gift, a jar,
and it was, like, 365 days.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.685
So, every day,
I pick out, like,

02:23.768 --> 02:25.812
a little piece
of paper from the jar.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.731
{\an5}And it'll say, like,
"memories" or reasons
why he loves me.

02:28.815 --> 02:31.609
{\an3}(chuckling)

02:31.693 --> 02:33.987
{\an4}It's the girliest thing
I've ever heard
a guy give a girl.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.739
{\an1}So, like, are you supposed
to, like, read one every day?

02:36.823 --> 02:38.199
{\an6}Yeah.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.199
For the next year?

02:38.283 --> 02:39.075
{\an6}Yeah.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.075
{\an1}So, he's, like,
we're gonna be together

02:39.158 --> 02:40.994
{\an5}for a whole 'nother year!

02:39.158 --> 02:40.994
{\an3}Yeah.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.371
And, like,
maybe we will be.

02:43.454 --> 02:44.080
But I don't plan
my life like that.

02:44.163 --> 02:46.082
Whatever happens
does happen.

02:46.165 --> 02:47.250
That's smart.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.252
All right, well, are you
going on the boat?

02:49.335 --> 02:51.212
I don't know yet.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.047
{\an1}I'm afraid Amanda's
gonna be there.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.632
Yeah, I don't blame you.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.426
{\an1}So, like, on the boat, what
do you think Garrett will do?

02:56.509 --> 03:00.054
{\an1}Do you think he'll, like,
get up and dance, and, like...

03:00.138 --> 03:01.389
{\an3}I hope.

03:01.472 --> 03:02.640
Do you mean the guys
are gonna be, like,

03:02.724 --> 03:04.100
cool with him
or, like--

03:04.183 --> 03:05.643
'Cause you know Garrett
from, like, high school.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
Do you think
their personalities

03:07.228 --> 03:09.022
are gonna go well together
or, like, clash, or...

03:09.105 --> 03:11.774
I know you don't know
Alex very well, but...

03:11.858 --> 03:16.905
{\an1}he's definitely known
in this town as a player.

03:16.988 --> 03:18.114
{\an3}I figure.

03:18.197 --> 03:21.784
{\an4}So, not only are you
on a boat with
a bunch of boys dancing,

03:21.868 --> 03:22.535
{\an1}you're on
Alex Kompo's boat.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.913

{\an4}dancing and partying
on a boat with
a bunch of guys,

03:29.792 --> 03:32.754

I hope now that you're
getting older, though,

it's not gonna be quite
as crazy as it has been.

it will be crazier than ever.

Oh, I don't think it
could be... any crazier.

05:59.734 --> 06:02.612
{\an1}Mom, I don't like that
you look at the negatives.

06:02.695 --> 06:04.155
Focus on the positives.

06:04.238 --> 06:06.240
{\an3}Well...

06:06.324 --> 06:07.784
I think you need
to learn some tools

06:07.867 --> 06:10.161
how to just relax
and not respond...

06:10.244 --> 06:13.206
{\an6}so quickly.

06:10.244 --> 06:13.206
Well, like...

06:13.289 --> 06:15.166
{\an1}I'm not the kind
calmest person on Earth.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.627

Chloe, we can all
learn tools that--

06:30.223 --> 06:31.599
{\an4}I don't have,
like, a problem
where it's, like,

06:31.682 --> 06:37.146
{\an4}I... really lash out
and I'm, like,
an angry person.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.900
I just think that I don't
know how to handle myself

06:40.983 --> 06:42.652
{\an1}when I get
super frustrated.

06:42.735 --> 06:45.154

counseling will help you...

06:45.238 --> 06:48.032
{\an4}Don't.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.032
...learn to relax
and not react.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.076
Stop... seriously.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.244

gotten to the point

It's not that big of a deal.

06:55.706 --> 06:57.333
Well, I've always
wondered if maybe

06:57.416 --> 06:59.335
some of your anger issues
had something to do

06:59.418 --> 07:02.088
with just not having
a dad involved.

07:02.171 --> 07:05.216
(dramatic music)

07:08.469 --> 07:11.013
I don't have anger issues.

07:11.097 --> 07:15.852
{\an1}And it does not stem
from not having a dad.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.520

talk about it.

having you around

{\an8}since that (bleep) went
down with... Chloe.

09:31.737 --> 09:33.823
(chuckling)

09:33.906 --> 09:37.785
Dude, Chloe's, like,
super mad at me right now.

09:37.868 --> 09:38.911
She is, like, one of
my best girlfriends.

09:38.995 --> 09:42.498
{\an1}And, like, I knew this was
gonna end up being an issue,

09:42.581 --> 09:46.002
{\an1}and it's making it difficult
for all of us to hang out.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.088

09:49.171 --> 09:51.173
If you have that attitude,
then you're right.

09:51.257 --> 09:53.592
But have you ever thought
about just squashing it?

09:53.676 --> 09:58.848
{\an1}Like, I wanna talk
to her but... I don't know.

09:58.931 --> 10:00.224
{\an1}Then again, it's, like,
do I really need

10:00.308 --> 10:01.934
{\an1}somebody like that
in my life?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.103
Give her the benefit
of the doubt.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.479
{\an1}I have told people plenty
of times, I love Chloe.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.190
I want to mend
our friendship.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.442
{\an1}And every single
time they tell me,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.027
{\an1}"Amanda, Chloe talked
(bleep) about you.

10:11.110 --> 10:13.029
{\an1}She's not a real friend.
Don't even try."

10:13.112 --> 10:14.488
She's talking (bleep)
out of anger.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.700
{\an5}But deep down inside,
she wants to go back
to how you guys were.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.201
I know it's gonna be hard--

10:19.285 --> 10:20.620
Well, then she can't
keep talking (bleep)

10:20.703 --> 10:22.121
{\an1}'cause I don't want somebody
like that in my life.

10:22.204 --> 10:22.872
{\an1}But she's hearing that
you're talking (bleep), too.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.041
{\an5}'Cause I hear it.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.041
But I'm not.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.459
{\an5}I'm getting text messages.

10:25.124 --> 10:26.459
If you really like her,

10:26.542 --> 10:27.626
you will meet up
with her face to--

10:27.710 --> 10:28.753
What do you mean,
really like her?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.129
I love the girl.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.964
{\an4}She was one of
my best friends.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.964
{\an3}So, then...

10:32.048 --> 10:33.841
{\an1}But she treats
people like (bleep).

10:33.924 --> 10:34.675
{\an5}If you guys wanna
move on, you gotta
squash what happened.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.844
And we can get
back to having fun

10:36.927 --> 10:43.392
{\an1}and enjoying this beautiful
place where we live.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.226
{\an1}I agree.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.187
{\an1}Right?
We'll squash it.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.481
We'll figure it out.

10:48.564 --> 10:50.316

Dad?

12:38.466 --> 12:39.592
{\an7}Oh, hey.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.927
I made a couple changes on

12:42.011 --> 12:44.513
to check them out before

Mechanical engineering...

12:58.360 --> 13:00.696
I don't have a lot of, like,
experience to put on there.

13:00.779 --> 13:01.864
{\an1}Well, I mean,
that's why you're...

13:01.947 --> 13:04.700
{\an6}I know.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.700
{\an1}You gotta start
and today's the day.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.327

he's, like...

13:07.578 --> 13:09.872
It's his company.

13:09.955 --> 13:12.541
{\an1}Now this guy, this is
a civil engineer.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.834
{\an3}Yeah, yeah.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.878
He does, um,
structural, civil...

13:15.961 --> 13:17.880
{\an1}Right.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.880
That's another thing.

13:17.963 --> 13:18.797
What if he doesn't
need mechanical?

13:18.881 --> 13:21.717
{\an1}Well, you've also
got the math degree.

13:21.800 --> 13:24.011
{\an1}So, obviously, you're
a numbers person.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.387
{\an3}Yeah.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.639
{\an1}I think you should
probably, uh, you know,

13:26.722 --> 13:29.433
show interest in his firm.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.894
{\an5}Have a few questions...

13:29.517 --> 13:31.894
{\an3}Okay.

13:31.977 --> 13:32.561
...uh, that you're
ready to, uh, ask.

13:32.645 --> 13:33.896
What are,
like, questions?

13:33.979 --> 13:36.232
{\an1}Well, I'm not-- I mean,
you're the engineer.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.234
I hope he doesn't ask
me too many questions

13:38.317 --> 13:39.401
'cause I really don't
have that much experience.

Hi, nice to meet you.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.017

You're a friend of Gary's?

14:12.101 --> 14:12.810
{\an3}Yes.

14:12.893 --> 14:14.603

14:14.687 --> 14:15.938
{\an1}I mean, you don't have
a lot of experience.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.482
{\an3}I don't.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.482
{\an1}Um...

14:18.566 --> 14:21.318
{\an5}I really, this--
this would be my first,
um, kind of intro

14:21.402 --> 14:23.696
{\an1}into the engineering world,
um, professionally.

14:23.779 --> 14:26.949
{\an1}The lack of
structural engineering

14:27.032 --> 14:29.868
is an issue, um...

14:29.952 --> 14:32.246
{\an4}Some of the candidates
already have a lot
of that stuff

14:32.329 --> 14:34.206
{\an5}under their belt.

14:32.329 --> 14:34.206
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.624
{\an1}Um, so...

14:35.708 --> 14:37.501
{\an1}I don't wanna keep
your hopes up or anything.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.253

So, what in particular
brought you here today?

15:03.819 --> 15:06.405
Did something happen
that's unusual?

15:06.488 --> 15:09.491
{\an7}Well...
very recently, um...

15:09.575 --> 15:12.786
{\an7}One of my best
friends, Amanda,

15:12.870 --> 15:16.540
{\an7}her and I got
in a altercation..

15:16.624 --> 15:19.001
{\an4}Um, she actually
broke my nose.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.001
{\an3}Wow.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.919
{\an5}And I had to have surgery.

15:19.084 --> 15:20.919
And how did that start?

15:21.003 --> 15:23.881
{\an1}My mom thinks
it's because of alcohol.

15:23.964 --> 15:24.715
{\an3}Alcohol?

15:24.798 --> 15:25.716
And I don't feel that way.

15:25.799 --> 15:28.761
{\an1}She suggested
really the therapy.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.722
And so that's
why I'm here.

15:31.805 --> 15:32.890
So, there's an assault
charge against Amanda?

15:32.973 --> 15:35.559
{\an5}No, I didn't file one.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.559
You didn't file on.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.103
{\an4}Unh-unh.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.103
{\an3}Okay.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.021
Has she been a friend
for a long time, or...

15:39.104 --> 15:41.690
{\an1}Yeah, we've known
each other since, like,

15:41.774 --> 15:43.525
{\an1}freshman year
of high school.

15:43.609 --> 15:46.236
Have you seen her?

15:43.609 --> 15:46.236
{\an1}No.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.447
I'm avoiding her.

15:48.530 --> 15:49.615
{\an1}(sighs)

15:49.698 --> 15:51.992
So this whole event

15:52.076 --> 15:55.537
had to be completely
startling to you.

15:55.621 --> 15:56.955
{\an1}(voice breaking)
Yeah.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.291
{\an1}It's, like,
I was traumatized.

15:59.375 --> 16:04.088
{\an1}Well, as time passes by,
it makes it more difficult.

16:04.171 --> 16:10.386
{\an1}I think what we need to look
at is the role of alcohol.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.179
You get reactive very fast.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.098
And that's certainly
something to think about,

16:14.181 --> 16:17.226
what the triggers are for
that, where it comes from.

16:17.309 --> 16:19.186
{\an1}Uhh...

16:19.269 --> 16:24.942
{\an1}Well, from what my mom
does tell me about my dad,

16:25.025 --> 16:27.778
{\an1}is that he is
a very aggressive,

16:27.861 --> 16:32.074
{\an1}argumentative,
uh, person, um...

16:32.157 --> 16:35.369
{\an1}And he is, uh, he's been
in and out of jail.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.453
You haven't even met him.

16:36.537 --> 16:38.038
{\an1}Never.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.792
{\an1}My mom left him when
she was pregnant with me.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.671
So, I don't even know him.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.798
{\an1}So to hear that,
like, my own father--

16:47.881 --> 16:48.966
{\an5}Yes, and some of it...

16:47.881 --> 16:48.966
Is, like...

16:49.049 --> 16:50.592
You know, some of it
can be genetic.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.927
{\an1}...In and out
of jail, yeah,.

16:52.010 --> 16:55.180
But that's not to say that it
has to be expressed that way.

16:55.264 --> 16:59.601
That's definitely
behavior that can change.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.019
The stress and the anger

17:01.103 --> 17:01.937
really, really
go hand-in-hand.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.772
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

17:02.020 --> 17:04.772
So, bringing down stress

17:04.857 --> 17:07.818
can make you less likely
to be angered so easily.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.403
{\an1}Yeah.
You think I don't let--

17:09.486 --> 17:11.696
So, can we move
from this point next time?

17:11.780 --> 17:14.700

what it says is...

in the school.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.588
Excited for law school?

24:24.671 --> 24:26.464
{\an1}Yeah, I mean,
I did apply to Stetson.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.384
{\an1}I thought I was gonna get in,
like, a walk in the park,

24:29.467 --> 24:31.052
But I got wait-listed.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.554
Oh, I'm sorry.

24:32.637 --> 24:33.847
{\an1}Yeah, it's kind
of like a bummer.

24:33.930 --> 24:35.640
{\an1}I was, like, really,
like blown away.

24:35.724 --> 24:36.892
I studied my ass off.

24:36.975 --> 24:37.893
Yeah, you worked
really hard.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.769
{\an1}I mean, it's not like
I won't go to law school

24:39.853 --> 24:41.062
if it's not Stetson.

24:41.146 --> 24:42.898
{\an1}There's other schools
around in the areas, USF...

24:42.981 --> 24:44.900
So, you're, like,
set on law school?

24:44.983 --> 24:46.484
{\an1}Yeah.

24:44.983 --> 24:46.484
{\an3}Really?

24:46.568 --> 24:49.946
{\an4}Yeah, I mean, obviously,
I love the water,
I love fishing.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.573
{\an1}And that (bleep)
costs money.

24:51.656 --> 24:53.992
So, for me, it's ideal.

24:54.075 --> 24:56.411
{\an1}I go to law school,
work my ass off,

24:56.494 --> 24:59.331
{\an1}and one day,
like, have a marina.

24:59.414 --> 25:01.208
{\an1}Have, like, a couple boats
that go out of there.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.585
{\an1}And just be able to, like,
retire and, you know, like...

25:03.668 --> 25:05.921
{\an1}I mean, nothing
good comes easy, so...

25:06.004 --> 25:07.672
No, that's so true
and it's, it's kind

25:07.756 --> 25:09.799
of good to have to work
for things sometimes.

25:09.883 --> 25:12.260
{\an1}Yeah.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.595
{\an3}Yeah.

25:13.678 --> 25:16.848
{\an1}They call me
Mr. Waitlist now.

25:16.932 --> 25:19.726
I call myself

turning points in our lives.

I mean, if I really look,
I can see a hole.

26:10.777 --> 26:12.487
I wish I got to go, though.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.363
Did Amanda go?

26:13.446 --> 26:14.322
{\an5}Yeah, she went.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.322
{\an3}Really?

26:14.406 --> 26:17.117
{\an1}Kelsey, Garrett,
Paul, BG.

26:19.244 --> 26:20.704
{\an5}Yeah, Chase...

26:19.244 --> 26:20.704
Did you invite Chloe?

26:20.787 --> 26:23.832
{\an5}Well, she came to see me.

26:20.787 --> 26:23.832
Oh, really?

26:23.915 --> 26:25.834
{\an5}She came over and,
like, brought me
ice cream and flowers

26:25.917 --> 26:28.628
and stuff like that,
which was really sweet.

26:28.712 --> 26:30.297
And we started talking
about the whole situation.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.882
And I tried,
um, offering up,

26:32.966 --> 26:36.303
you know, like, a meeting
between her and Amanda.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.804
(toy squeaks, Zeus snarls)

26:37.887 --> 26:40.181
{\an1}Do you think that, like,
you know, it would be best

26:40.265 --> 26:41.850
{\an1}if we were there
and they talked it out?

26:41.933 --> 26:44.060
{\an1}Well, I think that you might
be a little, like, biased.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.729
I don't know.

26:45.812 --> 26:48.940
{\an1}I mean, I want her
to act like her real self.

26:49.024 --> 26:51.192
{\an5}So, if I'm there...

26:49.024 --> 26:51.192
{\an3}Chloe?

26:51.276 --> 26:52.235
{\an5}And it's gonna prevent...

26:51.276 --> 26:52.235
Affect that.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.654
{\an1}Affect that, then it might
be best if you just go.

26:54.738 --> 26:55.739
{\an3}Yeah.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.782
{\an1}They just need to do it
as soon as possible.

26:57.866 --> 26:58.533
Maybe, like, this weekend.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.869
{\an4}Yeah.

26:58.616 --> 27:00.869
The sooner, the better.

27:00.952 --> 27:04.080
{\an5}We have to fix them.

27:31.983 --> 27:32.776
How are you
and Garrett?

27:32.859 --> 27:36.404
{\an7}It's frustrating
'cause after the boat,

27:36.488 --> 27:38.406
{\an7}he was, like, "So,
you were on Alex a lot."

27:38.490 --> 27:40.283
{\an8}That's a little
passive-aggressive.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.618
{\an1}Yeah, like,
we're on a boat.

27:41.701 --> 27:44.037
{\an1}You can't get too
far away from each other.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.457
{\an5}(Garrett)
I'm just in a place
where I'm still trying

27:47.540 --> 27:49.125
{\an8}to get to know
these guys

27:49.209 --> 27:51.002
{\an8}and make sure,
like, they're cool.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.921
{\an7}And wouldn't try anything
stupid, like, that was, like,

27:53.004 --> 27:55.757
{\an8}kind of weird, you know,
like, you're hanging out

27:55.840 --> 27:59.052
{\an8}with Alex and he's showing you
how to drive the boat, like...

27:59.135 --> 28:00.762
Knowing that I have
my boater's license.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.639
{\an5}Like, hey, I'll show
you how to drive the boat.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.639
{\an1}Yeah!

28:02.722 --> 28:05.100
Do you think, he, like,
is the jealous type?

28:05.183 --> 28:08.103
He did seem... jealous.

28:08.186 --> 28:11.106
Like, he won't
say it, though.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.524
I'm always keeping
an eye out on her.

28:12.607 --> 28:14.442
{\an1}You never know
what can happen.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.277
{\an5}Yeah, exactly,
you never know, like...

28:14.526 --> 28:16.277
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.946
What people
might try and do.

28:18.029 --> 28:18.947
{\an5}And those guys aren't...

28:18.029 --> 28:18.947
{\an1}Exactly.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.241
{\an5}like, my friends
that I grew up with.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.241
{\an1}Exactly.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.784
And you don't know if you
can trust 'em really yet.

28:22.867 --> 28:23.368
Yeah, exactly.

28:23.451 --> 28:25.495
I understand if Alex

28:25.578 --> 28:26.955
{\an1}has a certain
reputation and whatnot,

28:27.038 --> 28:29.249
{\an1}of getting girls, but, there's
nothing to be jealous of.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.126
{\an4}(Garrett)
I don't know, like,
if you have money,

28:31.209 --> 28:32.419
like, that's cool, just...

28:32.502 --> 28:33.837
I don't think you
should always be--

28:33.920 --> 28:34.587
{\an6}Flaunt it?

28:33.920 --> 28:34.587
{\an1}Yeah, like,
showing it off.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.132
{\an1}We click
and our personalities

28:37.215 --> 28:38.299
go really well together.

28:38.383 --> 28:39.592
{\an1}And he makes me laugh
and we're playful.

28:39.676 --> 28:42.137
{\an1}And I love
our relationship.

28:42.220 --> 28:45.306
{\an1}But then also, he just
needs to trust me.

28:45.390 --> 28:46.141
{\an1}He also needs
to trust the guys.

28:46.224 --> 28:47.308
And if he's not
gonna do that...

28:47.392 --> 28:48.601
I don't know.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.020
We just need to
figure it out.

28:51.104 --> 28:54.858
{\an5}I could see us
being together
for a long time and...

28:54.941 --> 28:56.317
Mom and Dad say it too.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.778
Yeah, like, she really
could be, like, the one.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.114
One of the hugest things is

29:01.197 --> 29:03.158
{\an1}I've traveled all
over the world, I've...

29:03.241 --> 29:04.451
{\an3}Seen more.

29:04.534 --> 29:05.702
{\an1}Yeah, and it's
made me grow up.

29:05.785 --> 29:08.371
But also, he doesn't have that
perspective as much 'cause...

29:08.455 --> 29:09.706
{\an1}he's lived in Florida
his whole life.

29:09.789 --> 29:11.291
{\an1}He's never even gone
out of the country yet.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.585
{\an3}Exactly.

29:13.668 --> 29:15.503
{\an1}And this relationship,
going into it,

29:15.587 --> 29:16.671
{\an4}I figured it'd be fun,
but, I just feel
like right now

29:16.754 --> 29:19.757
{\an1}things are
kind of... shaky.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.678
Either it's gonna work
or it's not gonna work.

29:23.761 --> 29:26.181
(Kelsey)
Why are relationships so hard?

29:26.264 --> 29:29.476
I knew I had to have an honest
conversation with Garrett,

29:29.559 --> 29:31.853
and I was dreading it.

29:54.834 --> 29:58.379

30:00.757 --> 30:01.883
{\an8}(chuckling)
Yeah.

30:01.966 --> 30:04.928
{\an8}I really just wanna go
into it, like,

30:05.011 --> 30:08.139
yeah, Juliette's gonna
be there, but, like,

30:08.223 --> 30:09.474
{\an8}this is a conversation
for Amanda and I to have,

30:09.557 --> 30:12.560
{\an8}like, as adults.

30:12.644 --> 30:16.064
{\an8}And I hope the outcome of this
is that we can start

30:16.147 --> 30:20.109
{\an8}on the path of, you know,
working things out.

30:33.289 --> 30:35.500
{\an8}Yeah.

30:35.583 --> 30:36.417
{\an8}All righty, thanks, babe.

30:36.501 --> 30:40.088

I'm sorry for my part

would have happened.

like, I know, like,
what I did in it.

32:25.860 --> 32:28.905
{\an1}And I'm truly
sorry for my fault.

because it got out of hand.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.171
{\an1}But I'm working
on myself and my mouth

32:45.254 --> 32:50.259
{\an1}because I know I was being,
like, angry and mean.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.553
{\an1}And, like, that's not
fair to anyone around me.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.013
{\an1}Like, my mom and I's
relationship has, like,

32:54.097 --> 32:57.975
been rocky and it's
just weird for me,

32:58.059 --> 33:01.938
{\an1}and I'm trying to
watch my mouth more.

33:02.021 --> 33:04.399
{\an1}You're the last person
I wanna fight with.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.233
Trust me, I agree.

33:05.316 --> 33:07.443
I did not want
to fight with you.

33:07.527 --> 33:11.322
But I want you to know
that coming into this,

33:11.406 --> 33:13.324
I was thinking
I don't know

33:13.408 --> 33:15.284
if I want you
in my life or not.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.870
'Cause if things were like
the way they were before,

33:17.954 --> 33:18.996
there's-- there's
no friendship there.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.376
You really do realize
how you have been acting

33:23.459 --> 33:27.255
{\an5}has really affected
the people that
really care about you.

33:27.338 --> 33:32.427
And I just really hope
that it changes something.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.428
Because it took it
to a whole new level.

33:33.511 --> 33:35.847
{\an1}Yeah.

33:35.930 --> 33:38.266
I'm absolutely sorry
that it did happen.

33:38.349 --> 33:42.603
{\an1}I never, ever planned on
ever hurting you like that.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.481
{\an5}I love you,
and you know that.

33:42.687 --> 33:45.481
{\an1}Yeah.

33:45.565 --> 33:48.443
{\an5}I'm really happy
that you wanna
move on from it,

33:48.526 --> 33:49.193
'cause I do too.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.237
But you know how I am.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.239
{\an5}Actions speak
louder than words.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.239
{\an1}Totally.

33:53.322 --> 33:55.450
When I see it, that's
when it's gonna be, like,

33:55.533 --> 33:57.368
okay, maybe Chloe
really is changing.

33:57.452 --> 33:58.953
{\an1}Yeah.

33:59.036 --> 34:03.291
{\an5}So, about the Brandon thing.

33:59.036 --> 34:03.291
Yeah.

34:03.374 --> 34:05.918
{\an4}It's obviously
the elephant
in the room.

34:06.002 --> 34:07.920
{\an1}It seems like he's
very into you.

34:08.004 --> 34:09.130
{\an1}It's probably
that ass of yours.

34:09.213 --> 34:12.759
{\an1}But I don't blame him.
And that's okay.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.719
But I can't be into somebody
that's into my best friend.

34:15.803 --> 34:17.638
Yeah, jealousy...

34:17.722 --> 34:20.808
I don't want that at all.
Like, not at all.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.101
{\an1}Yeah.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.393
Your friendship
isn't gonna go,

34:23.478 --> 34:25.228
like, right back
to what it was,

34:25.313 --> 34:27.607
but now that you know,
you've had this conversation,

34:27.690 --> 34:30.525
we can all hang out
in group settings again,

34:30.610 --> 34:31.777
{\an5}and it's not gonna be weird.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.777
{\an3}I hope so.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.322
Can we hug it out.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.322
{\an1}Yeah.

34:34.405 --> 34:35.864
Is that weird?
Do you wanna do that?

34:35.947 --> 34:37.324
Do you wanna be
in the hug, too?

34:37.408 --> 34:38.451
Well, I feel like
I wanna be included.

34:38.534 --> 34:39.702
Get in the love,
get in the love.

34:39.786 --> 34:43.790
