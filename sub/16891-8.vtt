10:26.231 --> 10:28.899
Tell you what. You get started.
We'll catch up with you later, all right?

10:28.968 --> 10:29.733
Got it, fam.

10:29.802 --> 10:30.567
Bye.

10:30.636 --> 10:32.469
Bye.

10:32.538 --> 10:34.838
We really going to catch up
with him later, as in drinking?

10:34.907 --> 10:36.606
No, you moron.
What's wrong with you?

10:36.675 --> 10:38.641
I think we should drink today.
Matter of fact,

10:38.710 --> 10:40.977
I think we should all get a free
pass this one day only.

10:41.046 --> 10:41.811
A one-day pass.

10:41.879 --> 10:43.579
Yeah. You know what?
That's not a bad idea.

10:43.647 --> 10:47.649
Yeah. This is a joyous family occasion.
I mean, face it.

10:47.717 --> 10:49.851
How many more of these are we going to have?
From here on in, it's

10:49.919 --> 10:53.087
probably divorce, rehab,
cancer, mostly of the balls.

10:53.156 --> 10:57.559
All right. No one is drinking, not
even me, all right? Thank you.

10:57.628 --> 10:58.460
Champagne?

10:58.529 --> 11:03.031
Beat it, sister. Mmm. New rule.
Champagne doesn't count.

11:03.099 --> 11:04.432
Champagne it is, then.

11:04.501 --> 11:05.199
No. I meant for me.

11:05.268 --> 11:06.800
I could drink a
shitload of champagne.

11:06.869 --> 11:08.202
Champagne's kid stuff.

11:08.271 --> 11:09.403
It's like wine soda.

11:09.472 --> 11:10.404
This could work.

11:10.473 --> 11:13.408
All those in favor
of champagne only.

11:13.477 --> 11:16.244
Oh, are you guys nuts?
Come on, knock it off.

11:16.312 --> 11:18.413
- Champagne is booze.
- Champagne is booze.

11:18.481 --> 11:20.244
The only person who gets
to drink is Sheila.

11:20.364 --> 11:21.683
The only person who gets
to drink is Sheila.

11:21.752 --> 11:22.851
Knock it off, Tommy.

11:22.920 --> 11:24.720
I was just reinforcing
your rule, honey.

11:24.789 --> 11:27.323
One day's worth of wine soda, Jan.
Come on. Why not?

11:27.391 --> 11:29.425
This from the man who threw a
dining table out a window at

11:29.494 --> 11:31.060
Bill McPhee's wedding 3 years ago?

11:31.129 --> 11:32.928
Yeah. How about the armoire that
you threw out the window at

11:32.997 --> 11:34.896
Kelly O'Brien's wedding
the year before that?

11:34.965 --> 11:37.899
It's wrong to have a specialty?
Besides, I was drinking whiskey both those

11:37.968 --> 11:39.867
times, not wine soda.

11:39.935 --> 11:43.536
Hey, listen. There is going
to be no drinking at all, OK,

11:43.605 --> 11:46.203
because I did not pay for this
whole shebang so that you guys

11:46.323 --> 11:48.541
could get shitfaced, start
insulting people, sleeping with

11:48.610 --> 11:51.244
waitresses, and making drunken speeches.
Right, Janet?

11:51.313 --> 11:54.848
Right. That's all we need, a bunch of
drunken Gavins getting into fistfights,

11:54.916 --> 11:57.217
breaking windows, and
making Mexican jokes.

11:57.286 --> 11:59.119
Why would we tell Mexican jokes?

11:59.188 --> 12:00.487
Shawn's mother's a wetback.

12:00.556 --> 12:01.788
Really?

12:01.857 --> 12:04.324
Hey, what do you get when you
cross a Mexican with an octopus?

12:04.393 --> 12:05.826
What did Janet just say?

12:05.895 --> 12:09.096
Jesus Christ. I swear to God,
I'll bounce each and every one

12:09.165 --> 12:11.468
of your asses right out of
this place, all right?

12:11.713 --> 12:16.270
No more drinking, no fighting, and
no Mexican jokes, all right?

12:19.542 --> 12:21.375
All right. One Mexican joke.
Get it out of your system.

12:21.444 --> 12:24.846
What do you get when you cross a
Mexican with an octopus?

12:24.914 --> 12:27.282
I don't know, but it sure
picks a shitload of lettuce.

12:27.350 --> 12:28.549
[Laughter]

12:28.618 --> 12:30.184
Knock it off, God damn it.

12:30.253 --> 12:34.154
It's not funny, all right?
Best behavior from here on in.

12:34.223 --> 12:36.256
That means you. You don't do the thing
you always do at weddings.

12:36.325 --> 12:38.058
What thing I always
do at weddings?

12:38.127 --> 12:41.261
Let me put it to you this way, sweetheart.
Just catch the bouquet, not an STD.

12:41.330 --> 12:43.296
Hey, can I help it if I get
romantic at weddings?

12:43.365 --> 12:44.798
There's just always something in the air.

12:44.866 --> 12:46.265
That thing in the
air is your legs.

12:46.334 --> 12:47.133
Ok, that's not funny.

12:47.202 --> 12:51.537
Ok, stop it. Now, for one day
only, we are not Gavins, OK?

12:51.606 --> 12:54.173
You are nice, decent,
civilized human beings.

12:54.241 --> 12:55.742
[All scoff]

12:55.810 --> 12:58.845
Uh! No booze, no wine soda.

12:58.913 --> 13:01.748
Forks and knives, napkins in
laps, and 2 feet on the floor

13:01.816 --> 13:06.753
at all times. And if any one of you
ruins my daughter's big day,

13:06.822 --> 13:10.657
your last breath on this earth
will be through my 2 hands.

13:10.725 --> 13:12.525
Yeah.

13:12.594 --> 13:13.759
Hors d'oeuvres?

13:13.828 --> 13:14.627
Yes, please.

13:14.696 --> 13:16.796
Bring it in. No booze on 3.

13:16.864 --> 13:17.496
1, 2, 3.

13:17.565 --> 13:18.731
All: No booze!

13:18.800 --> 13:19.733
[Laughter]

13:19.801 --> 13:23.436
[Singing in Spanish]

13:23.505 --> 13:24.303
What's with the 3 amigos?

13:24.372 --> 13:26.472
I don't know.
Black Shawn's parents paid for them.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.308
See those outfits?

13:28.377 --> 13:29.476
Ridiculous.

13:29.544 --> 13:31.811
Excuse me, waiter?
Can I get some more champagne?

13:31.880 --> 13:33.646
Sheila, it's me.

13:33.715 --> 13:37.950
Oh. Well, I'm sorry.
I just-- well, you're wearing the same

13:38.019 --> 13:39.151
thing as the waiters.

13:39.220 --> 13:42.421
Don't be ridiculous.
This is a very expensive jacket.

13:42.490 --> 13:43.789
- It is?
- Yes.

13:43.858 --> 13:45.758
Hey, can I get you
something, miss?

13:45.827 --> 13:47.393
Yes. I would like a champagne
with a champagne back.

13:47.461 --> 13:48.608
Sure.

13:50.498 --> 13:52.297
What?

13:52.366 --> 13:54.232
At least I got a reason.

13:54.301 --> 13:57.435
[Laughs]

13:57.504 --> 13:59.437
Ahem.

14:04.677 --> 14:12.950
Such a...
Just a-- great wedding...day.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.852
Yeah. It's very nice.

14:14.920 --> 14:15.653
Yeah.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.172
Yes.

14:19.426 --> 14:20.959
You know, we love Colleen.

14:21.027 --> 14:24.062
Yes, we do. She's lovely.

14:24.130 --> 14:24.996
Just lovely.

14:25.065 --> 14:27.332
Thank you, Doreen.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.101
Ah.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.002
Ah?

14:31.071 --> 14:31.870
Ah.

14:31.939 --> 14:32.904
Dorena.

14:32.973 --> 14:35.340
Dorena. Right. Yes. Dorena.

14:35.409 --> 14:36.508
Dorena.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.076
Sorry.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.478
That's a pretty name, Dorena.

14:39.547 --> 14:41.202
Yeah.

14:43.417 --> 14:50.922
So, Dorena, um, I understand
that you're an octigan. Mexipus.

14:50.991 --> 14:52.758
From Mexico.

14:52.827 --> 14:54.726
Yes, I'm Mexican.

14:54.795 --> 14:57.044
That's nice.

14:59.332 --> 15:02.067
We're assuming you like Shawn.

15:02.136 --> 15:04.570
Oh, yes. We didn't tell you that?

15:04.638 --> 15:05.904
No, you didn't.

15:05.973 --> 15:09.675
Oh. We love Shawn.
Don't we, Tommy?

15:09.744 --> 15:10.609
Huh?

15:10.678 --> 15:11.977
Shawn.

15:12.046 --> 15:14.079
[Scoffs] Garrity. Moron.

15:14.148 --> 15:15.014
Their Shawn.

15:15.082 --> 15:20.152
Black Shawn. Your Shawn.
You know what? The kid is just--

15:20.221 --> 15:21.921
I don't even know what to say.

15:21.989 --> 15:24.089
He's just--
Yeah.

15:24.158 --> 15:27.159
When's the baby due?

15:27.228 --> 15:28.795
What--they--
Oh, my God.

15:28.864 --> 15:30.291
They didn't say--
Well, Colleen didn't--

15:30.411 --> 15:31.881
No, no, no. You.

15:32.001 --> 15:33.267
Both: Ohh.

15:33.336 --> 15:36.665
That's right. Yes.
Uh-- you scared us. For a second there,

15:36.785 --> 15:38.089
I thought--wow.

15:38.442 --> 15:40.176
Yeah. About a week and a half.

15:40.244 --> 15:40.910
Yeah.

15:40.978 --> 15:43.646
Yeah. Oh, wow.

15:43.715 --> 15:49.853
Not that I mean, of course-- we would
have been happy with you in our family.

15:49.922 --> 15:50.620
Yes.

15:50.689 --> 15:53.824
Well, someday soon, we'll
all become grandparents.

15:53.892 --> 15:55.358
Yes. Yeah, we will. We will.

15:55.427 --> 15:57.460
And-- so Colleen and Shawn's kids.

15:57.529 --> 15:58.928
What color you think
they're going to be?

15:58.997 --> 16:00.563
Excuse me?

16:00.631 --> 16:03.399
I'm sorry. Ken Shea.
I'm a friend of Tommy's.

16:03.468 --> 16:04.481
He works with me.
He works with me.

16:04.601 --> 16:08.269
What color, off the top of your head--
We're in the middle of a conversation here.

16:08.338 --> 16:09.904
Well, I'm only bringing it up
'cause, you know, you mentioned

16:09.973 --> 16:11.363
it to me a couple of months ago.

16:11.483 --> 16:13.576
I was just-- you were concerned about
the color of your grandchildren?

16:13.644 --> 16:14.543
No.

16:14.612 --> 16:15.311
No.

16:15.380 --> 16:17.447
[Laughs] No, no, no. No. No.

16:17.515 --> 16:23.354
I was excited and curious, which
is why I was talking to the guys

16:23.422 --> 16:25.256
at the firehouse, 'cause to me,
Black Shawn always talked to me

16:25.324 --> 16:29.327
about the black rainbow, and I
was like, "Wow, what color are

16:29.396 --> 16:32.097
these kids going to be?" You know
what I mean? Black or purple or--

16:32.165 --> 16:33.465
Why would they be purple?

16:33.533 --> 16:35.733
- Did I say purple?
- Yeah.

16:35.802 --> 16:37.301
You know why I said purple?

16:37.370 --> 16:39.636
Because I was thinking of this
color, which is lavender, which

16:39.705 --> 16:42.987
is the color of the president's
lips, which--who I love.

16:43.107 --> 16:49.680
Voted for him. Love his--but that's--
again, who cares? Black, white,

16:49.748 --> 16:50.981
Mexican, I don't--you know.

16:51.050 --> 16:52.449
Mexican isn't really a color.

16:52.518 --> 16:55.119
No, it's not. It's not a color.
You know what it is?

16:55.187 --> 16:57.354
I'll tell you what it is.
Well, I don't have to tell you, but

16:57.423 --> 17:00.091
it's an attitude. It's an approach.
You know what I mean?

17:00.159 --> 17:04.362
It's like, hey, I'm a mexipus,
and I'm here, and I'm here to

17:04.431 --> 17:09.703
work 14, 16, 18, you know, uh--
you can't have a place like

17:09.771 --> 17:13.973
this. You think this is an Irish
guy's--no, it's, you know--

17:14.041 --> 17:18.577
All this lawn and everything?
It's your people making, you know,

17:18.646 --> 17:21.347
everything. Probably these
flowers, I mean, you know,

17:21.415 --> 17:27.152
which are beautiful.
Which really-- [Scoffs]

17:27.220 --> 17:29.154
It was nice meeting you two.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.026
Uh, it's--

17:45.923 --> 17:46.856
[indistinct talking]

17:46.924 --> 17:48.858
[Glasses clinking]

17:51.596 --> 17:54.430
[Cheering]

17:55.734 --> 17:56.366
Hey, get a room!

17:56.434 --> 17:59.835
Yeah. Check 1, 2, 1, 2.

17:59.904 --> 18:04.272
Ohh. Isn't that lovely?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it's time

18:04.341 --> 18:09.220
to toast to our newlyweds.
I'd like to please welcome Shawn's

18:09.340 --> 18:12.842
best man, our older
brother, D'Brickshaw.

18:12.911 --> 18:13.543
Yeah!

18:13.612 --> 18:16.180
Hey. Kanye West.

18:16.249 --> 18:16.981
Hey.

18:17.049 --> 18:23.122
Thank you. Thank you so much one and all.
And you are so

18:23.190 --> 18:28.828
welcome here.
I am Sheila, Colleen's auntie Sheila.

18:28.896 --> 18:34.434
[Laughs] Oh, my God.
Doesn't she just look so beautiful and so

18:34.502 --> 18:37.103
gorgeous and so grown-up?

18:37.172 --> 18:39.072
[Laughs] Yay!

18:39.141 --> 18:42.608
[Applause]

18:42.677 --> 18:45.436
Which makes the rest of us
really, really old.

18:46.844 --> 18:54.786
But what I really want to say, folks,
is that I am so glad-- [Dishes clattering]

18:54.855 --> 18:59.726
that I paid for the dress and
for the party and for the whole

18:59.794 --> 19:05.465
thing today. But nobody needs
to know about that, OK, because

19:05.534 --> 19:09.537
it's very gauche.
Please don't ask me about it again. Please,

19:09.657 --> 19:15.331
I beg of you. I just have so
many things that I want to say.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.557
[Snorts] Oh.

19:30.626 --> 19:34.061
[Chuckles]

19:34.130 --> 19:41.607
I was married once, to the love
of my life, James Keefe.

19:41.727 --> 19:45.633
Oh, my God. [Laughs] His name still
sounds like music to me.

19:45.756 --> 19:51.046
It really does. Oh, God.
And we loved to go to weddings

19:51.115 --> 19:55.985
together. We just did.
Because it reminded us of how we wanted

19:56.054 --> 20:00.990
to renew our vows at our 20th
anniversary, which I celebrated

20:01.059 --> 20:08.931
last year alone.
But I do not want to let that plan go to

20:09.000 --> 20:12.935
waste or this whole great,
fabulous day--these good

20:13.004 --> 20:16.840
feelings, right? Don't want to
let it go to waste. So I've been

20:16.909 --> 20:22.680
thinking there are 2 people that
mean so much to me. They have

20:22.748 --> 20:28.819
recently recommitted to each other.
And they have decided to

20:28.888 --> 20:35.726
make one more crazy goddamn shot
at it for the thousandth time.

20:35.794 --> 20:42.500
[Laughs] So, Tommy, Janet--
Hey, you guys, I'm talking about you.

20:42.568 --> 20:45.870
[Laughs] What do you say, huh?

20:45.939 --> 20:56.546
Why don't you renew your vows right
here, right now? What do you say?

20:56.615 --> 20:58.148
Ah. [Mumbles]

20:58.217 --> 20:59.249
[Grunts]

20:59.318 --> 21:00.550
Can I talk to you outside?

21:00.670 --> 21:02.485
Oh, no. You may--ow.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.286
You OK?

21:03.355 --> 21:06.822
You may not talk to me outside.
I'm more interested in

21:06.891 --> 21:12.962
what the 2 of you think. What do you say?
Come on! We want another wedding?

21:13.031 --> 21:14.731
We want a wedding!

21:14.800 --> 21:16.166
We want a wedding!

21:16.235 --> 21:18.369
We want a wedding!

21:18.437 --> 21:21.305
Please! Whoo!
We want a wedding! Whoo!

21:21.374 --> 21:27.379
No, no, no. Listen. I appreciate the sentiment.
You know, it's obviously a very

21:27.448 --> 21:31.517
emotional day. But it's not as
if I haven't at some point,

21:31.586 --> 21:35.221
you know, actually thought about,
you know, one day, Janet and I

21:35.289 --> 21:39.925
- maybe, you know, renewing our vows.
But, you know, it's-- - You have?

21:42.266 --> 21:46.499
Yeah, I have.
But today's Colleen's day, right?

21:46.567 --> 21:47.233
Yes.

21:47.302 --> 21:48.000
Yes.

21:48.069 --> 21:49.073
Yes.
And we appreciate the thought.

21:49.193 --> 21:52.405
Really? 'Cause you know, I
paid for this whole wedding,

21:52.474 --> 21:55.291
which I asked you
not to talk about.

21:55.411 --> 22:01.182
Uh-huh. Well-- well, the kids, right?
Just-- why don't we keep it--

22:01.251 --> 22:05.120
Don't touch this microphone.

22:05.189 --> 22:06.955
Mom? Dad?

22:07.024 --> 22:10.092
Yes?

22:10.160 --> 22:12.960
Hey! [Laughs] Oh. Here you go.

22:13.029 --> 22:14.829
Thanks. Oh.

22:18.078 --> 22:23.036
Um... this has been probably the
most perfect day of my life so far,

22:23.104 --> 22:27.406
and the only thing that can
make it more perfect, and

22:27.475 --> 22:31.411
the greatest wedding gift that
you guys could give us and me

22:31.480 --> 22:36.033
and Katie would be if you guys
renewed your wedding vows.

22:36.278 --> 22:37.809
Please.

22:40.656 --> 22:42.624
Well, honey, you know what?

22:42.692 --> 22:45.427
It's not just about you today.
I know it's your day, but it's

22:45.495 --> 22:51.707
also--it's Purple Shawn's-- Shawn--
I'm cool with it. Yeah. I'm-- let's go.

22:54.805 --> 22:57.672
We don't have a priest, so--
Uncle Mickey's here.

22:57.741 --> 23:01.775
We don't have a real-- problem.
We're going to have

23:01.844 --> 23:04.845
a real problem, because isn't
there a law against doing more

23:04.913 --> 23:09.216
than one marriage--
No, no. I'm good with it.

23:09.284 --> 23:11.184
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

23:11.253 --> 23:15.701
Please? It would make me so happy.

23:17.860 --> 23:22.063
Yeah. Ok. Yeah. Why not?

23:22.132 --> 23:24.065
[Cheering and applause]

23:26.516 --> 23:27.449
Shh. Shh.

23:27.518 --> 23:31.787
And Tommy's vows for Janet.

23:31.856 --> 23:36.659
I, Janet Gavin...
I, Janet Gavin...

23:36.779 --> 23:39.524
Do hereby promise...
Do hereby promise...

23:39.644 --> 23:42.516
To do everything my
husband says sexually.

23:42.636 --> 23:44.101
Oh, no, no. No.

23:44.170 --> 23:45.136
[Murmuring and laughter]

23:45.205 --> 23:47.005
- No, that's an "x."
- No, that's an "r."

23:47.073 --> 23:49.307
- It's an "x."
- He has bad handwriting.

23:49.376 --> 23:54.946
"Seriously." It says se-- seriously.
"Seriously, sweetheart.

23:55.589 --> 24:01.352
I tried to write nice vows, only
they came out sappy and a little gay.

24:01.420 --> 24:04.771
So what I'm going to go do instead is
beg you to marry me again,

24:04.891 --> 24:08.191
because I love you, and I've
always loved you,

24:08.260 --> 24:14.510
and you are the hottest woman I have ever
known, especially in that dress.

24:14.801 --> 24:18.200
So, please, please,
marry me again."

24:18.269 --> 24:18.968
Aww.

24:19.036 --> 24:20.002
All right, Tommy.

24:20.071 --> 24:22.005
[All talk and laugh at once]

24:22.073 --> 24:24.140
Pretty good.

24:24.209 --> 24:27.120
And Janet's vows to Tommy.

24:27.240 --> 24:30.332
Ahem. I, Tommy Gavin...
I, Tommy Gavin...

24:30.684 --> 24:33.241
Promise to love and protect...
Promise to love and protect...

24:33.361 --> 24:35.230
Honor and obey...
Honor and obey...

24:35.565 --> 24:39.993
And never, ever, ever, ever...
and never, ever...ever.

24:40.113 --> 24:41.340
You moused off an ever.

24:42.112 --> 24:44.294
Oh. I kind of--ever.

24:45.005 --> 24:47.745
Do any of the insane things
I've done in the past.

24:48.005 --> 24:49.719
Won't do any of the
things I did in the past.

24:49.839 --> 24:52.768
Insane things I've
done in the past.

24:53.237 --> 24:56.160
I won't do any of the insane
things I've done in the past.

24:56.280 --> 24:58.456
Including drinking...
I will not drink.

24:58.576 --> 24:59.482
Smoking.

24:59.602 --> 25:02.477
I haven't had a cigarette--
Smoking.

25:03.177 --> 25:06.013
Smoking. I won't smoke.

25:06.928 --> 25:10.712
Or having extramarital affairs, be they
with women inside or outside the family.

25:10.832 --> 25:12.620
It's me he's talking about.
Me. [Laughs]

25:12.688 --> 25:13.454
[Chuckles]

25:13.945 --> 25:14.820
Ok.

25:14.940 --> 25:15.677
Shh.

25:15.797 --> 25:18.629
So, by the power vested in me
by the state of New York...

25:18.749 --> 25:21.484
Um, actually...
there's more on the other side.

25:21.604 --> 25:22.964
Oh. Oh.

25:23.033 --> 25:24.799
There's more. There's more.

25:25.363 --> 25:32.073
I also make a solemn promise to...
[Laughs] I also make a solemn promise to...

25:36.746 --> 25:38.679
What?

25:43.486 --> 25:45.453
Retire from active duty...
What?

25:45.521 --> 25:47.521
And take a desk job downtown, a
training job, or any other job

25:47.590 --> 25:50.949
within the department that will
keep me out of harm's way for

25:51.069 --> 25:52.894
the sake of my family.

25:52.963 --> 25:57.732
Honey-- that's the way--just--
[Indistinct whispering]

25:57.801 --> 26:03.905
Honey... that's the vows.
And so-- [Indistinct whispering]

26:03.974 --> 26:05.507
I'm not--I can't do them.

26:05.575 --> 26:06.974
Just-- I warned you.

26:07.043 --> 26:09.010
Honey. Honey.

26:09.079 --> 26:09.977
Janet.

26:10.046 --> 26:10.878
Honey.

26:10.947 --> 26:12.747
Janet!

26:12.815 --> 26:16.083
I'm going to start drinking
and become a prostitute.

26:16.152 --> 26:19.419
Honey. I'll do it.

26:20.068 --> 26:20.935
You will?

26:21.055 --> 26:22.167
Yes. Honey.

26:22.236 --> 26:23.669
Yes? Yes?

26:23.737 --> 26:25.036
Hey! Hey!

26:25.105 --> 26:25.937
[Cheering and applause]

26:26.006 --> 26:27.572
If anybody here who knows why
these 2 people shouldn't be

26:27.641 --> 26:31.112
joined in holy matrimony, let them
speak now or ever hold their--

26:33.214 --> 26:35.682
You know what? Let's just skip that part.
I now re-pronounce you man and wife.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.517
[Cheering and applause]

26:37.586 --> 26:38.619
All right!

26:38.687 --> 26:39.953
All right!

26:40.022 --> 26:42.390
[Cheering and applause continue]

26:42.458 --> 26:44.125
Go up there!

26:44.193 --> 26:46.227
[Cheering]

26:46.296 --> 26:49.230
[Whooping and shouting
indistinctly]

26:51.601 --> 26:53.367
- Hey.
- Hey, pal.

26:53.435 --> 26:54.501
The head's around the corner.

26:54.570 --> 26:56.136
No, listen. Hey. You seen Emily?

26:56.204 --> 26:56.937
No.

26:57.005 --> 27:00.307
Ok. I need your advice. I need you to be
the voice of reason for me right now.

27:00.375 --> 27:01.041
Me?

27:01.109 --> 27:02.308
Yeah, I know. I'm doomed.

27:02.377 --> 27:04.577
Here's the thing.
You know, at at a wedding like this

27:04.646 --> 27:07.246
when everybody's all happy and lovey
and feeling all good, and you

27:07.315 --> 27:09.081
start thinking about your own
life and all that shit?

27:09.150 --> 27:13.086
That's what I'm doing. And here's what
I think. I'm going to ask Emily

27:13.155 --> 27:15.807
to marry me. Huh? Good idea?

27:15.927 --> 27:17.090
Bad idea?

27:17.159 --> 27:19.360
Dude, she stinks.

27:19.429 --> 27:24.032
Whoa. Hey. Only after sex, OK?
And to be honest with you,

27:24.100 --> 27:27.202
I'm starting to not smell it.
I mean, of course I smell it.

27:27.271 --> 27:29.705
It's like a trash dump in a third
world nation.

27:29.774 --> 27:33.775
But that's not the point. The point is,
I feel like it's a sign

27:33.844 --> 27:36.211
or something that I'm doing something
right, you know? It's weird.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.280
I mean, I can meet some other chick right
now and bang the hell out of

27:38.349 --> 27:41.483
her, and afterwards, if she
doesn't smell like a...

27:41.552 --> 27:44.519
Like a toxic waste facility, I'd
think I was doing

27:44.588 --> 27:48.356
something wrong, OK? This thing, man.

27:48.425 --> 27:56.531
It's not just an eye-watering,
nasty, horrific, soul-sucking

27:56.600 --> 28:04.240
fart anymore. You know?
It's-- it's the smell of love, man.

28:04.309 --> 28:07.144
Love.

28:07.212 --> 28:09.346
Sean, listen. Take my advice.

28:09.415 --> 28:10.981
You know, you got to sleep on this.
I mean, if you marry

28:11.050 --> 28:14.018
Emily, and you guys have kids,
what if they're farters, too?

28:14.086 --> 28:18.756
Then you'll be stuck with, like,
a really stinky family forever.

28:18.825 --> 28:22.527
So you're saying... don't do it.

28:22.596 --> 28:24.629
Don't do it.

28:24.698 --> 28:25.597
Ok.

28:25.665 --> 28:26.264
Yeah.

28:26.333 --> 28:28.566
Yeah. I'm going to do it.

28:28.635 --> 28:31.870
Thanks, man.
Good talk. You're always there for me.

28:45.688 --> 28:47.622
[Sighs]

28:52.129 --> 28:54.463
Ahh.

28:54.531 --> 28:59.001
Ooh.

28:59.069 --> 29:00.169
[Door shuts]

29:00.237 --> 29:02.171
[Crying]

29:05.242 --> 29:07.710
No one is ever going to want me.

29:07.778 --> 29:10.912
No one is ever going to touch me.
No one is ever going to

29:10.981 --> 29:12.914
marry me ever again. [Sobs]

29:19.056 --> 29:22.390
You leave this bed, I swear to
Christ, I will cut your balls

29:22.459 --> 29:24.359
off and sew them to a dog.

29:24.428 --> 29:26.361
Sit down. [Sobs]

29:30.901 --> 29:33.201
Will you please hold me?

29:33.270 --> 29:35.671
I don't think that's such a good idea--
Will you just hold me?

29:35.740 --> 29:37.673
I'm hurting! Have some kindness!

29:37.742 --> 29:39.676
[Sobbing]

29:42.482 --> 29:46.684
This is not the way that things
were supposed to end up.

29:46.753 --> 29:50.789
I'm a bridesmaid at somebody else's
wedding, someone who is young

29:50.857 --> 29:52.724
enough to be my daughter.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.226
Ah. Honey. This-- [Sobs]

29:55.295 --> 29:56.361
Not what it looks like.

29:56.429 --> 30:00.265
Hello. Well, it looks like you and
Sheila on a bed with your pants undone.

30:00.334 --> 30:03.268
This--this is--this is dinner-related.
This is not

30:03.336 --> 30:06.071
cock-related. I mean, could we
be having sex? She's crying.

30:06.140 --> 30:06.972
Don't answer that.

30:07.041 --> 30:09.241
Just--Tommy, get out of here.

30:09.309 --> 30:12.477
Oh, Sheila, honey. It's OK.
Let it out, honey.

30:12.546 --> 30:18.117
I--I was supposed to be married by now.
I don't know.

30:18.219 --> 30:19.919
Maybe to him. Maybe not to him.

30:19.988 --> 30:23.356
Honey. Honey, he was never
going to marry you.

30:23.425 --> 30:27.927
You know that. He was only interested
in himself. Yes, you had the grief

30:27.996 --> 30:31.898
connection. Yes, there was a mutual bond.
But as always,

30:31.966 --> 30:35.535
it was only about him. He's an ass.

30:35.603 --> 30:39.205
But he told me that he loved me.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.210
He loved the sex, you know?

30:44.279 --> 30:47.281
And I guarantee you that if I
drop dead, he'll be headed to

30:47.349 --> 30:50.517
your house a half an hour after
they stick me in the ground,

30:50.586 --> 30:53.320
wanting a hand job.

30:53.389 --> 30:57.091
Right, Tommy?

30:57.160 --> 31:00.628
That's a little--half an hour?
I mean, it's at least

31:00.697 --> 31:03.832
40 minutes from our
house to her house.

31:05.903 --> 31:14.511
I was just trying to throw a
little--ahem--levity into the... No.

31:15.412 --> 31:17.212
Go get some water.

31:17.280 --> 31:20.214
Ok. But you know what?
Let me just say something, OK?

31:20.283 --> 31:23.985
You know, it wasn't just about
the sex, you know.

31:24.053 --> 31:27.821
There was a real connection between us.

31:27.890 --> 31:31.658
And you know, it was about
healing and about grief,

31:31.727 --> 31:36.279
you know. The two of us.
And it-- and it was...

31:40.637 --> 31:43.672
Would you like ice in the water?

31:43.741 --> 31:45.541
Put some whiskey in it.

31:45.610 --> 31:47.210
Don't you think you've had enough?

31:47.279 --> 31:49.879
I said put some whiskey in it!

31:49.948 --> 31:52.448
Oh, gee, Gav. I'm sorry.

31:52.517 --> 31:53.316
[Crying]

31:53.385 --> 31:57.553
Oh, no. Honey, no.
You don't have anything to be sorry about.

31:57.622 --> 32:00.722
Look, you gave us this beautiful day.
Yeah, and Colleen is

32:00.791 --> 32:04.959
glowing thanks to you. Ok?
And then, the renewing the vow thing

32:05.028 --> 32:10.531
was a little insane, but it worked out
perfectly. You are a good friend.

32:10.599 --> 32:14.781
No, I'm not. I'm not a good friend.
I'm not.

32:15.163 --> 32:19.740
Look, we're close, and we can laugh about
stuff, and I can help you with

32:19.809 --> 32:23.424
your kids, and you can help me with my kid.
But honestly...

32:24.389 --> 32:30.364
I can't truly be around you for too
long for any given amount of time.

32:32.122 --> 32:34.622
Why not?

32:34.691 --> 32:39.628
Because, Janet.

32:39.696 --> 32:43.799
[Sobs] Everything I
wanted, you got.

32:43.867 --> 32:47.135
Oh.

32:47.204 --> 32:53.247
[Cries] Your husband went away.
And he came back.

32:53.798 --> 32:58.350
Mine, not so much.
It's never going to happen.

32:58.470 --> 33:02.922
So what am I left with here? Let's see.

33:03.042 --> 33:11.028
I've got a lot of money. I've got Damian
in a wheelchair. And, um. Oh, yeah.

33:11.096 --> 33:13.029
An empty bed. [Sobbing]

33:18.135 --> 33:20.068
You really need to get laid.

33:20.137 --> 33:22.403
I know!

33:22.472 --> 33:23.805
Mickey's downstairs.

33:23.873 --> 33:24.706
Ugh!

33:24.774 --> 33:27.208
Come on. He's a good man.

33:27.277 --> 33:30.011
He's a Gavin. What are the odds?

33:30.080 --> 33:32.814
Don't you think he
deserves another chance?

33:32.882 --> 33:35.183
Well, he is totally hot.

33:35.251 --> 33:40.921
[Sniffles] But I would only
be using him for sex.

35:33.269 --> 35:38.373
I'm sorry.
I was, uh, hearing her confession.

No. I watch the bus depot.

37:21.266 --> 37:22.379
Anybody inside?

37:22.420 --> 37:24.320
Eh. Chinks run the sweatshop
on the ground floor,

37:24.389 --> 37:26.189
but they usually clear out about 9:00.

37:26.257 --> 37:28.158

Could just be some kids

40:05.324 --> 40:07.624
We're on 3. We're in the
middle of an arson, chief.

All right. We'll get that goddamn door open.
I've been sitting on a power tank down here.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.292
Go, guys, go, go!

45:28.823 --> 45:30.247
Come on!

45:34.670 --> 45:35.543
Shit!

45:35.663 --> 45:37.349
The goddamn door won't shut!

45:37.469 --> 45:38.626
What do you got?

45:38.746 --> 45:40.050
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

45:41.148 --> 45:42.954
Hey, hey, hey.
We just go back. We're gonna be okay.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.326
Breath slow, breath slow.

45:45.446 --> 45:47.255
Let's go, go, go.

46:12.364 --> 46:13.971
Son of a bitch.

46:16.558 --> 46:17.997
Oh, shit.

46:19.803 --> 46:22.206
Urgent, urgent, the *** is bricked over.

46:22.326 --> 46:23.822
There's no means for regress.

46:24.113 --> 46:26.347
62 has no means of regress, okay?

46:29.248 --> 46:32.485
Nielsy, I want you
to get off that roof now.

46:32.605 --> 46:35.563
Repeat. The structure is compromised,
it is unstable.

46:35.683 --> 46:38.165
Get off that goddamn roof now.

46:54.752 --> 46:58.089
We're gonna be okay, we're gonna be alright.
Just breath easy, breath easy.

47:00.017 --> 47:01.517
***

47:01.637 --> 47:03.721
Come on, asshole. We don't quit.

47:06.294 --> 47:08.865
We're gonna be okay. We're gonna be alright,
we're gonna be alright.

47:15.373 --> 47:17.792
- What do you wanna do, Lou?
- Go, Tom, go.

47:18.985 --> 47:20.348
Sure?

47:21.312 --> 47:24.128
We'll be fine. Trust me.

47:24.603 --> 47:31.185
