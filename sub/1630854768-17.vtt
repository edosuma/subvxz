00:03.078 --> 00:04.244
JUDD RYDER:
There you go.

00:04.338 --> 00:06.563
-Come on. You got this, Wyatt.
-Come on, baby.

00:06.565 --> 00:08.156
Mom, please
don't call me a baby

00:08.217 --> 00:09.341
when I'm trying to lift
an actual baby fork.

00:09.493 --> 00:12.678
(chuckles) Okay.
My bad. My bad.

00:12.755 --> 00:13.661
JUDD: There it is.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.405
Alright, that's it.
That's it.

00:15.424 --> 00:16.923
MARLENE HARRIS:
Mm-hmm. Ooh.

00:17.018 --> 00:19.092
-Hey, alright.
-Good work.

00:19.245 --> 00:21.186
I mean, that was the,
that was the best one yet.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.855
Yeah. Good job, sweetie.

00:23.340 --> 00:25.265
I tell you what,
it's gonna be no time at all

00:25.417 --> 00:26.674
till you lift a fire hose.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.269
Oh, at least nobody's
getting ahead of themselves.

00:29.421 --> 00:30.270
Here you go.

00:30.364 --> 00:32.105
Take a little rest.
You earned it.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.941
This has to be
a good sign, right?

00:35.094 --> 00:36.093
Oh, it's definitely a good sign.

00:36.520 --> 00:38.853
Hopefully after
the nerve and muscle test today,

00:38.931 --> 00:40.188
we'll have some good news.

00:40.266 --> 00:41.874
-JUDD: Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, I know we will.

00:42.025 --> 00:43.784
-Hmm.
-Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

00:43.936 --> 00:44.785
How's your pain?

00:44.861 --> 00:45.952
It's better than yesterday.

00:46.363 --> 00:48.047
And a lot better
than the day before that.

00:48.198 --> 00:49.864
That's another good sign.

00:49.884 --> 00:50.883
Yeah, I mean, in his case,

00:51.034 --> 00:52.442
the pain
is the good sign, right?

00:52.702 --> 00:55.387
Hi. I know y'all are waiting
for the tech to come by

00:55.464 --> 00:57.281
to administer
the electromyogram

00:57.299 --> 00:59.783
and-and nerve conduction
velocity tests.

00:59.785 --> 01:02.469
Yeah, but only for about
the last six hours or so.

01:02.546 --> 01:05.380
I'm so sorry, but she got
called to another unit.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.066
She'll have to come by tomorrow.

01:07.217 --> 01:09.309
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:09.461 --> 01:10.903
Uh, tomorrow is fine, right?

01:10.979 --> 01:12.145
It's not like
I'm going anywhere.

01:12.298 --> 01:16.057
I'm so sorry.
We'll bring by dinner soon.

01:16.135 --> 01:17.576
Alright, thank you.

01:18.654 --> 01:19.561
Y'all pardon me for a second.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.654
I gotta call Owen and tell him

01:21.064 --> 01:23.665
I'm not going to be at
the firehouse tomorrow either.

01:24.401 --> 01:25.417
Wait, why?

01:26.111 --> 01:27.753
Well, you just heard
the nurse, right?

01:27.830 --> 01:29.329
I-I wanna be here for the test.

01:29.481 --> 01:30.981
Dad, it's not like
they do the test

01:31.074 --> 01:31.998
and then give you the results.

01:32.151 --> 01:33.092
They have to interpret them.

01:33.502 --> 01:35.243
Please, please
don't miss another shift.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.486
MARLENE:
You know, I'll be here.

01:36.505 --> 01:38.672
I'll call you as soon
as we know anything.

01:38.824 --> 01:39.747
(groaning sigh)

01:39.767 --> 01:40.933
Y'all sure?

01:41.084 --> 01:41.916
WYATT HARRIS:
Seriously, Dad,

01:41.936 --> 01:43.176
I'm just gonna sleep

01:43.420 --> 01:46.680
and try not to go insane
that I have an itchy ankle.

01:46.832 --> 01:47.664
So you have an itch?

01:47.683 --> 01:48.498
Definitely. Yeah.

01:48.758 --> 01:50.183
Both of them.
Since this morning.

01:50.336 --> 01:51.518
LEIGH ANN:
Wait, really? You feel them?

01:51.612 --> 01:54.004
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
They're driving me crazy.

01:54.006 --> 01:56.857
Oh, baby, that is amazing.

01:56.933 --> 01:58.117
I think that's about
as good a sign

01:58.193 --> 01:59.192
as we could hope for.

01:59.269 --> 02:00.786
Truly. That's...

02:00.788 --> 02:02.362
My boy's got itchy feet.

02:02.514 --> 02:03.847
-(group chuckles)
-WYATT: Hmm.

02:03.849 --> 02:04.772
Where?

02:04.850 --> 02:06.458
(laughter)

02:08.020 --> 02:09.044
(knock on door)

02:11.132 --> 02:13.114
-Dad.
-Is this a bad time?

02:13.192 --> 02:15.192
No, we were
just expecting some friends.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.451
Oh, I can come back
another time.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.044
No. Dad, come on.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.471
-GABRIEL REYES: Yeah?
-Yes.

02:20.716 --> 02:21.956
-Hi.
-Hey.

02:22.034 --> 02:24.125
-How are you?
-How you doing, TK?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.051
Can I get you
something to drink?

02:25.128 --> 02:26.461
Uh, just water, please.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.705
I'm meeting Andrea
at Ditallio's in 20 minutes.

02:28.724 --> 02:30.724
-TK STRAND: Ooh, okay.
-Which is why I was
in the neighborhood.

02:31.377 --> 02:33.360
What's going on?
Come on, sit down.

02:34.229 --> 02:36.546
So, uh... (sighs)

02:37.324 --> 02:42.052
The name Reyes came up in
the Ranger daily briefing today.

02:42.054 --> 02:44.646
But not my name. Yours.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.556
Everyone I work with
is talking about

02:46.558 --> 02:49.168
how my son took down
an organ trafficking ring.

02:49.244 --> 02:51.503
Not single-handedly.

02:51.897 --> 02:53.079
I hope you made that clear.

02:53.232 --> 02:55.007
Why would I wanna do that?
(chuckles)

02:55.417 --> 02:57.417
I can crow about my son
if I want, right?

02:57.511 --> 02:58.402
Yeah, you can.

02:58.495 --> 02:59.236
GABRIEL:
It's not the first time

02:59.571 --> 03:01.238
you've given me reason
to be proud.

03:01.240 --> 03:03.073
In fact,
Assistant Chief Bridges

03:03.091 --> 03:04.999
is wondering why you're
still working patrol.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.244
He thinks APD
is squandering your talents.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.095
Oh, it's not the APD's fault.

03:09.248 --> 03:10.414
I mean, Sarina Washington

03:10.432 --> 03:13.025
has been on him
to take the detective exam.

03:13.176 --> 03:15.176
I already told
Detective Washington

03:15.196 --> 03:16.528
and my eager fiancé here

03:16.647 --> 03:19.589
that I don't think
it's the right move for me.

03:19.591 --> 03:21.200
You know what? I agree.

03:21.777 --> 03:23.109
-You do?
-I do.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.112
I mean,
APD is a fine organization.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.599
But why would you wanna
take the detective's exam

03:30.193 --> 03:32.377
when you could become
a Texas Ranger?

03:33.789 --> 03:34.755
Wow.

03:35.941 --> 03:37.441
Babe?

03:37.443 --> 03:38.124
Uh...

03:38.610 --> 03:40.277
Uh, that would be
an incredible honor.

03:40.279 --> 03:43.280
But I-I could get transferred
to Amarillo or Brownsville.

03:43.298 --> 03:45.373
-Our lives are here.
-No, you wouldn't be.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.784
You'd be working right here,
right next to your old man.

03:47.803 --> 03:48.727
I don't know.

03:49.955 --> 03:51.045
This feels like nepotism.

03:51.123 --> 03:53.214
It's not nepotism.
It's legacy.

03:53.292 --> 03:56.050
Just like TK followed Owen
into the fire services.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.310
But if it makes you
feel any better,

03:57.463 --> 03:58.720
this offer isn't coming from me.

03:58.739 --> 04:01.889
It's coming directly
from Assistant Chief Bridges.

04:02.225 --> 04:03.700
I'm just here to extend it.

04:09.141 --> 04:11.959
I'm sorry, but I can't.

04:13.145 --> 04:15.829
Look, uh... I know
it's a lot of pressure,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.256
but you've got
the chops for it.

04:17.332 --> 04:18.982
Don't be afraid
of success, son.

04:18.984 --> 04:20.166
It's not success
that bothers me.

04:20.335 --> 04:23.095
I... just don't think
that the Rangers are for me.

04:23.171 --> 04:24.429
Can-can we just
leave it at that?

04:24.581 --> 04:27.307
What do you mean
not for you?
Something bothering you?

04:28.160 --> 04:30.644
Well, their motto for one.

04:31.755 --> 04:33.438
"One Riot, One Ranger."

04:33.590 --> 04:37.017
Well, that's just
hyperbole, son.
It's bluster.

04:37.093 --> 04:39.194
The Porvenir massacre.

04:40.005 --> 04:41.113
Was that bluster?

04:42.174 --> 04:44.116
Well, what's
the Porvenir massacre?

04:44.192 --> 04:47.677
The Rangers gunned down
15 unarmed Tejano men and boys

04:47.679 --> 04:50.530
as part of their mission
to secure Texas territories,

04:50.607 --> 04:55.460
specifically from groups of
Mexican and indigenous descent.

04:56.371 --> 04:57.521
That was 1918.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.190
Yeah, but that still remains
their mission to this day.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.875
And there are
plenty more examples

05:01.969 --> 05:04.803
of them victimizing,
terrorizing innocent people

05:04.954 --> 05:06.596
that look exactly like us.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.034
It sounds like you're
calling me a Tío Tomás.

05:11.036 --> 05:13.553
No, I didn't say that, Dad.

05:13.630 --> 05:17.298
I do understand the desire
to be accepted by people

05:17.376 --> 05:19.735
who have
historically rejected you.

05:21.897 --> 05:23.405
I see.

05:24.808 --> 05:26.825
And can I ask how long
you've felt this way?

05:27.477 --> 05:28.994
The legacy
of the Texas Ranger

05:29.145 --> 05:31.038
isn't exactly a secret, Dad.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.706
No.

05:34.317 --> 05:36.626
I mean, how long have
you been ashamed of me?

05:38.488 --> 05:40.130
-MARJAN MARWANI: Hey, hey, hey!
-(Paul laughing)

05:40.732 --> 05:41.656
Party, party!

05:41.675 --> 05:42.674
-MARJAN: Hey.
-NANCY GILLIAN: Hey.

05:42.826 --> 05:44.401
I hope you
two pretty boys are ready

05:44.403 --> 05:46.011
to go down tonight
because I'm feeling

05:46.088 --> 05:47.495
particularly ruthless today.

05:47.514 --> 05:49.089
PAUL STRICKLAND:
Yeah, she is not kidding.

05:49.241 --> 05:50.073
Should have seen
the way she slipped

05:50.075 --> 05:51.016
into my parking spot earlier.

05:51.167 --> 05:52.684
Hey, what's up, Major Reyes?

05:52.836 --> 05:53.852
You here for game night?

05:54.188 --> 05:56.096
No, I was just leaving.
You folks have fun tonight.

05:56.172 --> 05:58.523
(somber music playing)

06:04.031 --> 06:07.032
(theme music plays)

06:07.442 --> 06:09.701
MARJAN:
Hey, bud. How you doing?

06:09.778 --> 06:11.277
I'm alright. Hey...

06:11.354 --> 06:14.039
sorry we had to cancel
the group hang like that.

06:14.190 --> 06:16.023
-Aw man, no worries.
-Looks like we walked in on

06:16.101 --> 06:17.784
some pretty serious
family drama.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.694
Well, the rift between Carlos
and his dad isn't new.

06:19.771 --> 06:22.697
It just sucks that
it opened up right before
the wedding, you know?

06:22.791 --> 06:24.383
So, what's your plan?

06:24.459 --> 06:27.052
-The plan for what?
-To heal the rift!

06:27.129 --> 06:28.778
Who's riftin'?

06:29.114 --> 06:30.371
Carlos and his dad.

06:30.449 --> 06:32.391
Well, they could always
settle it the Ryder way.

06:32.542 --> 06:34.467
Oh yeah? And what's
the Ryder method?

06:34.620 --> 06:36.302
Well, anytime me and
my brothers were fightin',

06:36.379 --> 06:38.730
my dad would just kind of
shove us all into the closet

06:38.807 --> 06:41.382
and if we didn't
come out friends,
we didn't come out.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.310
Well that sounds like a case
for Child Protective Services!

06:44.463 --> 06:47.297
Yeah, and I think forcing Carlos
into a closet

06:47.315 --> 06:49.390
is what started
all this in the first place.

06:49.468 --> 06:51.317
-(all laughing)
-So, forget the closet.

06:51.394 --> 06:54.246
Why don't you just get them
to sit down with each other?

06:54.322 --> 06:56.248
I don't think a sit-down
is gonna fix this, Nance.

06:56.324 --> 06:59.159
Why not? They settled
two World Wars that way.

06:59.235 --> 07:00.827
Yeah, well, that
and an atomic bomb.

07:00.904 --> 07:01.828
-(all laughing)
-NANCY: Okay.

07:01.905 --> 07:03.313
You know what
I think they need?

07:03.331 --> 07:05.148
-TK: Hm?
-A good go-between.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.967
I'm not tryin'
to get in between that.

07:09.504 --> 07:11.321
But maybe I'm not
the one that has to.

07:11.323 --> 07:14.057
Mateo, you're a genius,
thank you!

07:15.602 --> 07:16.843
HOLLY: Peek-a-boo!

07:16.920 --> 07:17.919
A-peek-a-boo.

07:17.996 --> 07:18.770
(Holly laughs)

07:18.847 --> 07:20.513
I see you.

07:20.666 --> 07:21.848
Peek-a-boo!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.016
A-peek-a-boo.

07:23.092 --> 07:25.335
I see you. Yes, I do.

07:25.337 --> 07:26.695
-(lever clicks)
-Oh. All done.

07:30.642 --> 07:33.843
Hey. Uh, sorry, ma'am.
I-I didn't mean to scare you.

07:33.862 --> 07:35.436
It's just that I ran outta gas,

07:35.456 --> 07:37.772
and I just, and I realized
I forgot my wallet.

07:37.866 --> 07:38.898
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-VINCE: Yeah.

07:39.050 --> 07:40.125
And my son's home alone,

07:40.352 --> 07:43.110
so anything you can spare,
it would really help.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.521
Sure.
I-I think I've got a 20.

07:44.614 --> 07:47.466
Oh, well, cool.
Well, God bless you.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.195
-I'll take the keys as well.
-Wait, wait.

07:52.214 --> 07:54.547
Come on, give me the keys!

07:54.700 --> 07:55.548
(Holly grunts)

07:55.701 --> 07:56.791
(Piper crying)

07:56.868 --> 07:58.201
Wait! Wait! Wait!

07:58.294 --> 07:59.719
My daughter's in there!

07:59.796 --> 08:01.796
Piper! Piper!

08:01.815 --> 08:03.523
Wait! Help!

08:04.467 --> 08:06.485
-(tires screech)
-(horn blares)

08:06.636 --> 08:08.528
Piper!

08:12.400 --> 08:13.992
Somebody kidnaped your child?

08:14.143 --> 08:15.476
Yes, he carjacked me
at knife-point.

08:15.496 --> 08:17.570
My daughter was still in
the backseat when he drove off.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.664
Okay, take a deep breath for me.
My name is Grace.

had a little disagreement
over the Texas Rangers.

13:47.143 --> 13:49.052
No, there's no disagreement.

13:49.070 --> 13:50.477
It was just
a matter of factual record.

13:50.555 --> 13:52.980
They have a history of
utilizing violence against us,

13:52.999 --> 13:54.682
Latine and indigenous peoples.

13:54.759 --> 13:55.908
They fought efforts

13:56.061 --> 13:57.577
to desegregate schools
in the '50s--

13:57.653 --> 13:58.728
And they also have a history

13:58.730 --> 14:00.487
of kicking the crap
out of the KKK,

14:00.507 --> 14:03.991
shutting down Jim Crow,
and stopping human traffickers.

14:04.069 --> 14:06.845
Not to mention,
they got Bonnie and Clyde.

14:06.996 --> 14:09.072
Hmm. Another case of overkill.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.016
Do they have blood
on their hands,<i> mijo?</i>
Yes.

14:12.427 --> 14:16.245

that's 200 years old doesn't?

a little something

14:20.268 --> 14:22.435
about this man
you think you know.

14:23.421 --> 14:26.089
When your father started off
with the Rangers,

14:26.091 --> 14:28.199
there were 96 sworn officers.

14:28.760 --> 14:30.994
Do you know how many of them
were people of color?

14:32.280 --> 14:34.873
Two. And that's
including your father.

14:35.024 --> 14:37.375
Yeah. I think you're
making my point for me.

14:39.454 --> 14:40.937
You know,<i> mijo,</i>

14:40.939 --> 14:42.772
did you know
that when your father

14:42.774 --> 14:44.273
got promoted to Captain,

14:44.292 --> 14:47.293
he began
spearheading a campaign
to recruit and train

14:47.370 --> 14:50.263
talented people of all
backgrounds and genders?

14:51.040 --> 14:52.724
-No.
-Well, he did.

14:54.285 --> 14:56.969
And you know what percent
of the Rangers

14:57.122 --> 14:59.063
are of color or women today?

14:59.900 --> 15:01.024
Five?

15:01.793 --> 15:04.051
Almost 30.

15:04.070 --> 15:07.071
More than a tenfold increase
under his watch.

15:07.148 --> 15:09.632
-Hmm?
-Wow. I didn't know that.

15:09.651 --> 15:12.468
When was the last time
you heard your father

15:12.470 --> 15:14.987
boasting about anything
other than the Astros bullpen?

15:15.064 --> 15:16.080
Right.

15:16.157 --> 15:18.491
He doesn't brag about it
because...

15:18.567 --> 15:20.810
he thinks that there's
still plenty of work

15:20.812 --> 15:21.994
that needs to be done.

15:22.497 --> 15:26.925
But your father
is a good and honest man.

15:27.076 --> 15:28.651
And he deserves your respect.

15:28.670 --> 15:29.910
I do respect him.

15:30.004 --> 15:31.170
But are you proud of him?

15:31.247 --> 15:33.339
Of course I am.
He knows I am.

15:33.491 --> 15:35.582
Does he?
Because I'm not so sure.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.584
Well, I spent my whole life
not knowing

15:37.662 --> 15:38.327
if he was proud of me.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.438
So I guess that's only fair.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.358
You know what I think,<i> mijo?</i>

15:44.927 --> 15:46.352
I think this
tension between you

15:46.429 --> 15:50.506
is about more than
just the Texas Rangers.

15:50.508 --> 15:52.951

whatever you're feeling,

15:53.027 --> 15:55.286

15:55.438 --> 15:56.603

our family has learned

16:01.944 --> 16:05.380

16:57.075 --> 16:59.517

his hands are good, you know?

16:59.927 --> 17:02.020
But his legs have a...

17:02.580 --> 17:06.274
a decreased conduction velocity
or something.

17:07.193 --> 17:07.933
I see.

17:08.677 --> 17:11.270
And the doctors just,
just said that they, you know,

17:11.364 --> 17:14.032
they think that that means
that there's a 99% chance

17:14.183 --> 17:16.242

the conduction in his hands

17:32.110 --> 17:33.776
is better, though, right?

17:33.778 --> 17:35.111
Yes. Yeah. Yeah.

17:35.113 --> 17:37.513
No, he can make
a fist and, uh...

17:40.209 --> 17:42.376
He can almost
pick up his own fork.

17:42.378 --> 17:44.437

17:51.554 --> 17:52.487
(sighs)

17:53.631 --> 17:56.799
I don't know how
we got to a world where

17:57.410 --> 17:59.802
my boy being able
to pick up a fork

17:59.804 --> 18:01.395
is a good thing, you know?

18:02.156 --> 18:04.332
It means that he can
take care of himself.

18:06.068 --> 18:07.585
And he can hold his baby.

18:16.078 --> 18:17.153
(voice breaking)
Yeah, I know.

18:17.246 --> 18:19.322
But he's supposed to be
doing other things.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.081
He's supposed
to be swinging an ax.

18:21.101 --> 18:22.249
He's supposed to be
running a line

18:22.268 --> 18:24.660
and putting out a fire
and saving people.

18:24.679 --> 18:26.229
He wanted to do that.

18:26.831 --> 18:28.013

18:28.166 --> 18:29.565

18:35.840 --> 18:37.031
He don't know.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.616

18:38.843 --> 18:40.601

18:40.620 --> 18:43.770
And, uh, Marlene has
medical power of attorney.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.415

18:47.185 --> 18:48.584

18:50.446 --> 18:53.038

what I'm gonna do.

19:05.294 --> 19:09.538
I don't know how I'm gonna
break that... news to him.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.731
And, uh...

19:12.986 --> 19:14.468
I don't know about
after that either.

19:14.545 --> 19:16.988
Uh, yeah. Yeah.
Y'all got a long road ahead.

19:17.064 --> 19:19.215
Yeah, that's for sure.

19:19.308 --> 19:22.285
Just remember, miracles happen.

19:23.054 --> 19:24.278
I guess.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.480
We've both seen 'em.

19:26.557 --> 19:28.908
Seen the other way a lot
more often, though, ain't we?

19:29.002 --> 19:30.651
You know?

19:30.728 --> 19:31.586
(Judd clears throat)

19:36.843 --> 19:39.427
(inhales and exhales)

19:45.243 --> 19:47.435
(monitor beeping)

19:49.096 --> 19:50.396
(door opens)

19:51.840 --> 19:53.858
-Hey.
-Hey, Judd.

19:53.935 --> 19:56.402
-Hey, Dad.
-Leigh Ann here?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.178
WYATT: Uh, no, no.

19:58.256 --> 19:59.697
She has finals coming up,

19:59.774 --> 20:01.273
so I sent her home to study.

20:01.350 --> 20:03.492
Well, that was
considerate of you.

20:05.446 --> 20:06.520
Aah!

20:06.656 --> 20:08.188
-He's making progress.
-(Wyatt chuckles)

20:08.208 --> 20:09.999
He's doin' real good.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.585
Uh, oh, I got you this...

20:14.029 --> 20:15.963
Oh, thank you so much.

20:17.383 --> 20:18.441
Uh, what is it?

20:18.551 --> 20:21.201
It's just, um, it's just
a little scratcher.

20:21.279 --> 20:22.127
That way if it
feels like there's

20:22.280 --> 20:23.721
ants going across your foot,

20:23.798 --> 20:25.130
you can give it a scratch.

20:25.283 --> 20:26.949
WYATT:
Yeah, I appreciate it.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.226
Thank you.

20:28.786 --> 20:30.453
Oh, Dad, before you ask,

20:30.455 --> 20:34.047
no, they still haven't brought
by my test results, which, um...

20:34.125 --> 20:37.026
-Yeah.
-WYATT: Super annoying, but...

20:38.404 --> 20:39.128
What?

20:39.297 --> 20:41.313
Um, actually, sweetheart,

20:41.466 --> 20:46.035
they did bring your test results
while you were sleeping.

20:46.971 --> 20:48.579
Why-why didn't you tell me?

20:48.656 --> 20:51.332
'Cause your mom and I wanted
to tell you together.

20:52.234 --> 20:53.334
Why?

20:56.589 --> 20:57.588
Oh.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.150
So it's bad?

21:01.168 --> 21:02.593
MARLENE: Um...

21:03.671 --> 21:05.170
How bad is it?

21:05.323 --> 21:06.913
-MARLENE: Uh...
-They...

21:06.991 --> 21:08.340
Wh-what they,
what they're saying

21:08.417 --> 21:10.250
is that the nerve conduction

21:10.328 --> 21:12.603
in your legs
ain't what it should be.

21:13.664 --> 21:14.605
Meaning?

21:16.667 --> 21:20.236
They don't expect you
to gain function
of 'em anytime soon.

21:22.931 --> 21:24.365
Or at all?

21:25.785 --> 21:26.617
(Marlene sighs)

21:27.120 --> 21:29.436
But-but, no, my, uh, my feet.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.347
Remember, they were,
they were itching earlier?

21:31.349 --> 21:33.682
How could I feel them
if they were itching,
you know?

21:33.701 --> 21:36.185
Well, the doctor said
that they can still be itchy.

21:36.537 --> 21:39.946
You know, it's like, um,
phantom limb pain.

21:40.466 --> 21:43.592
Or it could be that
the neural pathways are still...

21:45.138 --> 21:46.679
still firing.

21:48.049 --> 21:49.548
But they don't think
I'll ever walk again.

21:49.625 --> 21:51.367
I don't give a damn
what they think.

21:51.460 --> 21:53.794
Okay, so...
what am I looking at?

21:53.813 --> 21:54.979
What do you mean?

21:55.130 --> 21:57.315
I mean, like,
what-what, what happens next?

21:57.466 --> 22:00.376
They're gonna transfer you
to another facility

22:00.394 --> 22:02.486
where you're gonna
start working on

22:02.638 --> 22:06.473
physical and occupational
therapy every day.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.309
What is that?
Occupational therapy?

22:09.387 --> 22:10.736
Well, it's where they...

22:11.497 --> 22:13.480
it's where they teach you
how to get control

22:13.499 --> 22:16.742
of your arms and your,
and your hands again.

22:16.819 --> 22:18.377
And...

22:20.081 --> 22:21.839
You know, how to, how to...
(sniffles)

22:21.990 --> 22:23.156
how to brush your teeth, how to,

22:23.176 --> 22:24.842
how to comb your hair.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.595
You know, how to,
how to live your life.

22:29.073 --> 22:30.589
Well, I'm never,
I'm never even gonna see

22:30.741 --> 22:32.257
outside of a hospital
again, am I?

22:32.334 --> 22:33.258
Yeah, you are, too.

22:33.335 --> 22:34.259
-It's gonna be two mon...
-Yes.

22:34.412 --> 22:35.853
They said three months
at the most.

22:36.004 --> 22:36.912
Three months?

22:36.931 --> 22:38.097
Either way, you're gonna be done

22:38.215 --> 22:40.099
by the time Leigh Ann
has the baby.

22:40.175 --> 22:42.342
No, I don't think
I can do it, Mom.

22:42.420 --> 22:43.419
-Yes, you can.
-Okay, okay.

22:43.437 --> 22:45.254
-I can't do it, no.
-Hey.

22:45.272 --> 22:46.346
WYATT:
I wanna go home, please.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.865
Please, I just wanna
go home, okay?

22:48.016 --> 22:48.866
Please. Can we go home?

22:49.017 --> 22:50.183
MARLENE:
Wyatt, look at me.

22:50.352 --> 22:51.944
-You got this, baby.
-WYATT: Mom, I can't do it.

22:52.096 --> 22:53.496
I can't.

22:57.118 --> 22:58.209
GRACE: Hey, babe.

22:58.285 --> 22:59.418
Hey.

23:00.362 --> 23:02.621
(sighs) Charlie, go down okay?

23:02.773 --> 23:03.455
Uh, she did.

23:03.549 --> 23:04.882
It took a few encore readings

23:05.033 --> 23:06.366
of<i> This is Not My Hat.</i>

23:06.386 --> 23:09.011
But she did
eventually go down, yes.

23:09.630 --> 23:10.796
What you doing?

23:10.948 --> 23:13.057
I'm just,
I'm going over these...

23:13.134 --> 23:16.209
places that they wanna
send Wyatt to

23:16.229 --> 23:17.786
after he gets discharged.

23:17.788 --> 23:18.804
Uh-huh.

23:18.881 --> 23:19.730
It's called a SNIF.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.382
A Skilled Nursing Facility.

23:22.793 --> 23:26.629
That don't exactly have
a pleasant ring to it, do it?

23:26.964 --> 23:30.074
Um, it's not
the most inviting, no.

23:30.225 --> 23:32.801
Well, it-it actually,
it looks worse than it sounds.

23:32.820 --> 23:36.229
I looked it up. It's just
a big concrete block off 79.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.322
Right?
He'd have a roommate.

23:37.475 --> 23:39.232
He'd have to share a TV
with somebody.

23:39.310 --> 23:42.494
He'd have one window
and he'd be looking out
at a parking lot.

23:43.147 --> 23:44.755
We knew this wasn't
gonna be easy.

23:45.332 --> 23:47.166
Grace, I think that place
would break him.

23:47.818 --> 23:50.594
I'm not sure there's much
we can do about it, honestly.

23:51.431 --> 23:52.763
I mean, there is.

23:54.341 --> 23:56.058
Like, he could come here.

23:57.937 --> 23:58.919
In the house?

23:59.497 --> 24:01.272
-Look, Grace.
Grace, Grace. Hang on.
-Wait--

24:01.423 --> 24:02.923
There ain't no reason
that we can't set up his bed

24:02.942 --> 24:05.167
in the living room, right?

24:05.186 --> 24:06.944
And then we do
all his therapy here.

24:07.095 --> 24:08.529
Sweetheart.

24:10.007 --> 24:12.174
Okay, but where
would the nurses stay?

24:12.193 --> 24:15.010
Because Wyatt would need
around-the-clock care.

24:15.621 --> 24:19.348
Exactly.
For his occupational,
uh, therapy and his PT.

24:19.366 --> 24:22.126
-I mean--
-It's not just that, sweetheart.

24:22.128 --> 24:23.869
Wyatt needs professionals

24:24.464 --> 24:27.798
to come in and change
his catheters, to bathe him.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.284
Turn him over so that
he doesn't get bedsores.
All of that stuff.

24:31.362 --> 24:33.679
Are those things
that you would be ready for?

24:35.883 --> 24:37.308
Maybe not.

24:38.385 --> 24:39.810
But I will be.

24:39.962 --> 24:41.127
And in the meantime,
the nurses,

24:41.147 --> 24:42.462
they can come and go
as they please.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.389
They can give him
any care that he needs.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.485
Who will be here
to let them in the house?

24:50.639 --> 24:52.281
Me. I'll do it.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.328
Judd, you're gonna
quit your job?

24:59.665 --> 25:00.706
Babe...

25:02.168 --> 25:05.377
for 17 years,
I wasn't there for that boy.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.298
And I have a chance
to make that right.

25:10.918 --> 25:12.468
And I ain't gonna miss it.

25:20.669 --> 25:21.560
Okay.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.563
Alright, you won't.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.507
I love you.

25:27.585 --> 25:28.651
Okay.

25:29.754 --> 25:30.694
Okay.

25:39.096 --> 25:40.329
(knock on door)

25:41.282 --> 25:42.689
-GABRIEL: Hey, Carlitos.
-Hey.

25:42.783 --> 25:43.999
You-you have a minute?

25:45.102 --> 25:46.952
Sure. Come on in.

25:47.104 --> 25:49.463
(soft music playing on radio)

25:54.128 --> 25:56.053
Were you doing puzzles?

25:56.947 --> 25:58.038
Yeah.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.965
Why, is that strange?

26:00.117 --> 26:01.392
I didn't know you did puzzles.

26:01.543 --> 26:04.711
Your mom and I got into them
during the pandemic and...

26:05.547 --> 26:08.440
Well, it helps me
take my mind off work.

26:12.313 --> 26:13.312
Um...

26:14.222 --> 26:16.723
You want something to drink?
Beer, green tea?

26:16.801 --> 26:18.242
-Green tea?
-GABRIEL: What?

26:18.319 --> 26:19.968
Since when do you
drink green tea?

26:19.970 --> 26:21.153
A couple years now.

26:21.229 --> 26:23.080
They say it's good
for blood pressure

26:23.157 --> 26:25.565
and general wellness.

26:25.826 --> 26:27.418
General wellness?

26:27.903 --> 26:29.545
Who the hell are you right now?

26:30.739 --> 26:31.738
(chuckles)

26:32.074 --> 26:34.316
-Hey, Dad.
-Huh?

26:34.451 --> 26:37.344
I didn't like how
we left things the other day.

26:39.599 --> 26:40.639
Yeah.

26:41.917 --> 26:43.083
Neither do I.

26:43.661 --> 26:45.661
I just want you to know
that I'm sorry.

26:46.330 --> 26:47.771
You don't have to
say you're sorry.

26:48.332 --> 26:51.500
If the Rangers is not for you,
then it's not for you.

26:51.502 --> 26:54.002
I'm not sorry about what I said

26:54.021 --> 26:55.504
but the way I said it.

26:56.357 --> 26:59.675
You never have
to apologize to me
for telling the truth.

26:59.693 --> 27:00.701
And the truth is...

27:02.513 --> 27:04.437
I didn't exactly give you
a laundry list of things

27:04.515 --> 27:06.439
to be proud of
when you were growing up.

27:07.852 --> 27:09.960
And that's something
I'm gonna regret
to my dying day.

27:10.112 --> 27:12.037
No. That wasn't the truth.

27:12.189 --> 27:13.964
I'm proud of you, Dad.

27:14.116 --> 27:15.341
And I'm proud to be your son.

27:15.450 --> 27:17.359
Carlitos, you don't have
to say all that.

27:17.378 --> 27:20.471
I'm not just saying all that.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.475
You're the best man I know.

27:28.555 --> 27:31.231
And that's why I would
like you to be my best man.

27:31.692 --> 27:32.708
Best man?

27:33.152 --> 27:34.801
Your... For your wedding?

27:34.895 --> 27:36.803
-Me?
-If you'd be willing.

27:36.897 --> 27:38.638
If I'd be willing?

27:38.716 --> 27:39.657
You couldn't...

27:41.385 --> 27:43.744
It would be the greatest honor
of my life.

27:48.668 --> 27:49.500
Ah.

27:50.227 --> 27:52.911
Thank you. Thank you.

27:52.988 --> 27:54.254
I love you, Dad.

27:54.823 --> 27:55.822
I love you, too.

27:56.567 --> 27:58.158
You know what?
Screw the green tea.

27:58.252 --> 28:00.427
We're drinking tequila.
Come on, let's celebrate.

28:02.998 --> 28:04.072
JUDD: Hello, hello.

28:04.166 --> 28:06.016
Oh, in here.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.018
This was on your tailgate.

28:08.170 --> 28:09.687
My milk. Thank you.

28:09.763 --> 28:11.188
You do a little shopping?

28:11.339 --> 28:13.098
Yeah. Robert and his family
are flying in for the wedding

28:13.175 --> 28:14.583
and I figured I'd stock up,

28:14.585 --> 28:16.342
but I wanted to do it while
Mateo's out of the house.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.603
He's staying with Nancy
while the family's here.

28:18.756 --> 28:19.863
That'll be good for you.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.440
Oh no, I love Mateo.

28:21.592 --> 28:22.849
No, no, no. I mean...

28:23.110 --> 28:27.095
you'll get to spend
some time with,
uh, your new family.

28:27.097 --> 28:28.947
My new old family.

28:29.024 --> 28:30.374
Yeah.

28:30.784 --> 28:32.334
New old family.

28:33.787 --> 28:36.046
I think that's what
I'm here about, too, Cap.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.623
My new old family.

28:38.776 --> 28:39.591
Uh...

28:41.870 --> 28:43.220
Cap, I have to quit.

28:43.297 --> 28:44.796
You have to quit what?

28:44.949 --> 28:46.724
My job.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.208
What are you talkin' about?

28:48.285 --> 28:50.877
We're bringing Wyatt home
to live with us.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.545
And, uh...

28:52.957 --> 28:54.064
I made the decision

28:54.291 --> 28:56.734
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
be his caretaker full-time.

28:58.963 --> 29:00.070
I think you mean caregiver.

29:00.555 --> 29:02.740
Yeah. Oh, yeah,
'cause he ain't a ranch.

29:02.891 --> 29:05.225
I know. Gracie keeps
fixing me on that, too, but...

29:05.244 --> 29:07.486
Okay, but given
Wyatt's condition,

29:07.638 --> 29:08.245
isn't he gonna need

29:08.581 --> 29:11.473
a very specific type
of caregiving?

29:11.492 --> 29:13.066
Well, yeah, he-he's going to.
He's going to have all that.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.418
He's gonna have
all the nurses

29:14.569 --> 29:16.979
and the therapists
that he needs.

29:16.997 --> 29:18.814
But then I'll be his
day-to-day, you know?

29:18.816 --> 29:21.817
And he won't be with
a bunch of strangers, right?

29:21.819 --> 29:23.677
He-he'll have his dad.

29:24.764 --> 29:25.912
I don't know what to say.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.339
I don't either.

29:27.491 --> 29:29.825
Actually, I do.
Don't quit. Don't do it.

29:30.478 --> 29:33.270
Call it a temporary
leave of absence.

29:33.347 --> 29:35.497
Uh, if you file
for early retirement,

29:35.499 --> 29:38.016
you're only gonna get 40%
of what you have coming to you.

29:38.093 --> 29:39.777
I understand that.

29:39.928 --> 29:41.336
But if I put in right now,

29:41.355 --> 29:43.171
they'll give me
a big chunk of it up front

29:43.190 --> 29:44.931
from all that sick time
and vacation

29:44.950 --> 29:46.266
I racked up over the years.

29:46.343 --> 29:47.993
You know, over 20 years.

29:48.770 --> 29:50.329
And, uh...

29:51.214 --> 29:52.456
we got some expenses now.

29:52.607 --> 29:53.940
It's...

29:54.018 --> 29:57.035
It's-it's-it's not cheap
to turn your front parlor

29:57.187 --> 29:58.796
into a rehabilitation center.

29:59.690 --> 30:01.465
Well, you've really
thought about this.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.375
Man, I-I don't know
if I thought about it long,

30:03.527 --> 30:06.470
but I do reckon
I've made my decision.

30:07.807 --> 30:09.306
Damn it, Judd.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.717
-I wanna thank you--
-ROBERT STRAND: Owen.

30:12.794 --> 30:14.228
In here.

30:15.297 --> 30:16.647
(Judd clears throat)

30:16.798 --> 30:17.889
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:17.966 --> 30:19.224
Oh. Hey, Sydney.

30:19.301 --> 30:20.725
-It's good to see you again.
-Hey, Owen.

30:20.802 --> 30:22.227
-Thanks for having us.
-OWEN STRAND: Thank you.

30:22.304 --> 30:26.048
Judd, this is my brother Robert
and, uh, his wife Sydney.

30:26.066 --> 30:28.383
And his girls,
Yvonne and Hannah.

30:28.810 --> 30:31.078
And, everybody,
this is Judd Ryder, he's...

30:32.890 --> 30:34.222
my best friend.

30:35.483 --> 30:37.742
So y'all girls came
all the way out here
for your cousin's wedding?

30:37.895 --> 30:40.987
Yeah, for the wedding
of our cousin who we've
only met over FaceTime.

30:41.065 --> 30:44.324
Well, he's gonna appreciate
you comin' all that way,
I bet you.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.751
So... I'll tell you what.

30:46.904 --> 30:47.845
I'm gonna
get outta y'all's hair.

30:47.996 --> 30:49.179
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

30:49.331 --> 30:50.572
Yeah. Well, you, too.

30:50.574 --> 30:52.266
And, uh...

30:55.929 --> 30:58.355
We'll see ya.
Ladies.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.030
(clinking)

31:07.182 --> 31:08.866
Everybody,
if you'll indulge me,

31:08.942 --> 31:11.017
I just wanna say a few things.

31:11.095 --> 31:11.943
TK: Uh-oh.

31:12.020 --> 31:12.944
Dad, how drunk are you?

31:13.097 --> 31:14.020
-(laughter)
-I am not drunk.

31:14.039 --> 31:16.540
I am just naturally
ruddy-cheeked.

31:16.691 --> 31:17.449
(laughter)

31:17.601 --> 31:19.859
So as I look around this table,

31:20.195 --> 31:25.273
it is impossible for me
to state my gratitude.

31:26.201 --> 31:29.535
It was almost four years ago
that I dragged my son,

31:29.889 --> 31:32.556
if not kicking, then certainly
a little bit screaming,

31:32.749 --> 31:34.892
from New York to Texas.

31:35.543 --> 31:39.955
I had just accepted a job
rebuilding a fire station

31:39.973 --> 31:41.398
that had suffered...

31:42.292 --> 31:45.310
unbelievable loss and grief.

31:45.387 --> 31:47.963
It was a good cause
and a noble one,

31:47.965 --> 31:50.073
but not at all why we came.

31:51.151 --> 31:53.410
I was desperate
to save my son's life...

31:54.062 --> 31:55.537
and maybe my own.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.155
I-I believe in AA.

31:57.324 --> 31:59.824
It's what you call doing
a, a geographic,

31:59.901 --> 32:01.234
moving away from the danger,

32:01.253 --> 32:04.980
which is not usually
a Strand's first instinct.

32:04.998 --> 32:06.423
(laughter)

32:07.259 --> 32:08.408
TK...

32:09.153 --> 32:10.986
I couldn't save you
in New York.

32:11.655 --> 32:14.348
And the truth is,
I couldn't save you
here either.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.642
You had to do it.

32:18.162 --> 32:19.436
And you have.

32:20.940 --> 32:23.315
I could not be
more proud of you, Son.

32:24.759 --> 32:26.151
Carlos...

32:27.112 --> 32:30.113
when I see you and TK
together,

32:30.265 --> 32:33.341
I realize that coming
to Austin isn't...

32:33.360 --> 32:35.661
the roll of the dice
that I thought.

32:36.847 --> 32:37.788
It was meant to be.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.017
And, uh,
if TK's mother were here,

32:42.019 --> 32:43.518
I'm sure that she would
be able to say this all

32:43.520 --> 32:46.112
in a much better way
than-than I have.

32:46.131 --> 32:48.298
She's here, Owen.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.717
And you said it pretty well.

32:52.863 --> 32:54.454
To TK and Carlos.

32:55.032 --> 32:56.622
And the Strand-Reyes clan.

32:57.034 --> 32:58.976
-Reyes-Strand.
-(Andrea laughs)

32:59.127 --> 33:01.061
(glasses clinking,
group cheering)

33:04.708 --> 33:05.965
Only one each, kids.

33:05.985 --> 33:07.484
<i> Solamente uno.</i>

33:08.895 --> 33:11.637
You heard your daughter.
One.

33:11.991 --> 33:13.156
They have tres leches
and galletas,

33:13.308 --> 33:14.825
how can I just pick one?

33:14.976 --> 33:16.142
Ma, it's a celebration.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.643
Cut him some slack.

33:17.721 --> 33:20.055
Yeah, well, you tell him that
when he tries to squeeze

33:20.057 --> 33:21.147
into his tux later.

33:21.225 --> 33:22.815
He already has too much slack.

33:22.835 --> 33:25.485
-Do we really have
to do that tonight?
-ANDREA REYES: Yes.

33:25.562 --> 33:27.671
And then you're gonna
get started on your speech.

33:27.748 --> 33:30.507
<i> Ay, por favor,</i> the wedding
isn't until this weekend.

33:30.658 --> 33:34.069
You are gonna give
a best man speech
after Owen Strand.

33:34.071 --> 33:36.087
Did you not hear
that man's toast?

33:36.164 --> 33:38.432
<i> -Por favor.</i>
-I mean, he was alright.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.001
Hey, brother,
that glass looks a little low.

33:42.354 --> 33:44.837
Oh, well,
then help a brother out.

33:44.857 --> 33:45.764
Here you go.

33:46.174 --> 33:47.582
How great is this, huh?

33:48.027 --> 33:50.676
Family, all together like this.

33:51.012 --> 33:53.613
Oh, it's-it's magic
is what it is.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.034
Stop staring, Owen.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.370
Have you told 'em?

34:00.931 --> 34:01.930
(sighs)

34:01.932 --> 34:03.540
Yeah, we told 'em last week.

34:04.192 --> 34:05.208
I mean, it's not like
I was gonna be able

34:05.435 --> 34:07.044
to keep this a secret
much longer anyway.

34:07.195 --> 34:09.379
How did they take it?

34:09.531 --> 34:12.007
At first, they were
just devastated.

34:13.277 --> 34:15.443
And it turned out that they were

34:15.462 --> 34:18.947
stronger than I could
have ever imagined.

34:18.949 --> 34:20.039
How so?

34:20.784 --> 34:24.061
Syd maybe turned into
a little bit of a Nurse Ratched.

34:24.137 --> 34:25.729
You know,
she's always making sure

34:25.806 --> 34:27.289
I take my pills and...

34:27.974 --> 34:30.901
And Hannah offered
to quit her Summer Stock

34:30.977 --> 34:32.127
so she could be around more.

34:32.554 --> 34:34.887
Yvonne is waking up
early every morning

34:34.965 --> 34:36.531
to make me breakfast.

34:37.134 --> 34:38.075
That's so great.

34:38.302 --> 34:39.892
No, the gesture sure is,

34:39.912 --> 34:42.245
but, uh, the food, not so much.

34:42.730 --> 34:43.914
I mean, it's-it's mostly

34:44.065 --> 34:46.399
this-this porridge
and cream of wheat.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.585
It's just stuff
that's easy to swallow.

34:50.405 --> 34:52.547
Is, is it becoming hard
for you to swallow?

34:54.760 --> 34:58.428
Every damn thing about this
is becoming hard to swallow.

34:59.673 --> 35:02.324
But... yes.

35:02.342 --> 35:05.560
This disease is a hungry beast.

35:06.754 --> 35:09.439
But that is not
what tonight is about.

35:11.259 --> 35:13.652
-Tonight is about...
-This.

35:19.451 --> 35:22.536
(monitor beeping)

35:23.697 --> 35:24.679
Hello.

35:24.698 --> 35:26.364
-Back again?
-Yeah.

35:27.701 --> 35:30.669
I just didn't want him to have
to spend the night alone, so...

35:31.779 --> 35:33.213
That's very sweet.

35:34.341 --> 35:36.133
You want me to see
if I can find you a cot?

35:36.284 --> 35:38.710
No. No, that's alright.

35:38.862 --> 35:40.362
I... (clears throat)

35:40.380 --> 35:41.529
Are you sure?

35:41.623 --> 35:43.882
You're gonna kill your back
in that chair.

35:44.034 --> 35:45.625
No, I'm a f--

35:45.719 --> 35:47.978
My back's strong enough.

35:48.054 --> 35:51.055
Well, if you change
your mind, let me know.

35:51.132 --> 35:52.482

40:04.051 --> 40:05.759
I've heard so much about you.

40:05.795 --> 40:07.362
The boys adore you.

40:07.797 --> 40:08.796
<i> Bueno.</i>

40:08.815 --> 40:11.132
<i> Te ofrezco mi profundo pésame.</i>

40:11.635 --> 40:14.577
<i> Es evidente que su esposo</i>
<i> era un hombre muy querido.</i>

40:14.729 --> 40:15.912
<i> Sí. Gracias.</i>

40:16.063 --> 40:17.247
-TOMMY: Mm-hmm.
<i> -Es verdad.</i>

40:17.323 --> 40:18.973
And thank you for coming.

40:18.992 --> 40:19.916
Of course.

40:20.067 --> 40:22.109
And, Owen,
thank you for hosting.

40:22.162 --> 40:23.461
I'm happy to do it.

40:23.997 --> 40:25.338
Our house...

40:26.925 --> 40:27.924
I just couldn't get it ready.

40:28.427 --> 40:32.095
I kept trying to scrub
the blood off the entryway.

40:33.414 --> 40:35.339
It had soaked
into the wood floors.

40:35.416 --> 40:36.916
(voice breaking)
They'll need to be replaced.

40:36.993 --> 40:38.009
<i> Me permites?</i>

40:38.085 --> 40:39.436
(sobs)

40:42.849 --> 40:43.773
(Andrea sniffles)

40:44.501 --> 40:47.593
He's gonna be watching over you
and your family.

40:48.113 --> 40:51.364
God bless you. And thank you.

40:53.026 --> 40:54.284
Remember, he'd pull us
out of school

40:54.286 --> 40:56.527
and tell the office
it was an urgent family matter?

40:56.604 --> 40:58.621
WOMAN: Yes. Sometimes
he'd even flash his badge

40:58.698 --> 41:01.941
and then take us out
for ice cream or to the movies.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.035
Or the puppet shows
when we were sick.

41:04.187 --> 41:05.186
Puppet shows?

41:05.188 --> 41:06.204
WOMAN:
Not a puppet show exactly.

41:06.356 --> 41:08.539
He'd use our stuffed animals.

41:09.134 --> 41:11.134
You never told me that.

41:11.285 --> 41:13.194
Because I have
no memory of it.

41:13.196 --> 41:15.046
You were so little, Carlitos,

41:15.198 --> 41:17.456
but he was always
so sweet with you.

41:17.809 --> 41:18.808
BRIDGES:
Oh. (clears throat)

41:18.960 --> 41:20.535
Oh, I'm sorry
to interrupt you all,

41:20.553 --> 41:22.720
but, uh, Carlos,
can I get a word with you?

41:22.872 --> 41:24.230
Of course.

41:30.730 --> 41:33.472
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am about your daddy

41:33.492 --> 41:36.308
and... tell you
how grateful I am

41:36.328 --> 41:39.053
to have been able to work
beside him all these years.

41:39.055 --> 41:40.330
Thank you, sir.

41:40.907 --> 41:42.999
And thank you
for your powerful words

41:43.150 --> 41:44.817
at the funeral today.

41:44.894 --> 41:46.294
Hey, I, uh...

41:47.172 --> 41:48.988
I want to
give you something

41:49.065 --> 41:50.757
I believe belongs to you.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.599
His Ranger star.

42:01.578 --> 42:03.186
I appreciate you
letting me have this.

42:03.337 --> 42:07.248
I do hope you know
how proud he was of you.

42:07.267 --> 42:08.841
-I think so.
-BRIDGES: Don't ever doubt it.

42:08.918 --> 42:10.360
Not even for one minute.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.740
CARLOS:
I need to ask you.

42:18.019 --> 42:19.427
Have the Rangers...

42:20.263 --> 42:22.597
made any progress
in figuring out who did this?

42:22.599 --> 42:23.522
Carlos, you know

42:23.783 --> 42:26.376
I can't discuss
an ongoing investigation.

42:27.028 --> 42:28.670
I don't need any names,
just...

42:30.123 --> 42:31.439
Is there one?

42:31.958 --> 42:33.532
Carlos, your daddy
spent a lifetime

42:33.610 --> 42:35.276
tangling with some
of the worst bad guys

42:35.295 --> 42:37.870
the state of Texas has to offer.

42:37.947 --> 42:38.963
He was fearless.

42:39.449 --> 42:42.041
Along the way,
he made some enemies.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.043
But I can promise you this.

42:44.120 --> 42:46.621
I will not enjoy
a night's rest till we find

42:46.623 --> 42:49.123
that son of a bitch
that did this to your daddy

42:49.125 --> 42:50.458
and to our brother.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.903
So what you're really telling me
is you have no idea

42:54.130 --> 42:55.238
who murdered my father?

42:55.389 --> 42:57.907
Carlos, look, I wish I had
better news for you.

42:58.059 --> 42:59.075
I-I really do.

42:59.302 --> 43:01.152
But right now,
you need to look after yourself,

43:01.228 --> 43:03.246
and you need
to look after your mama.

43:03.397 --> 43:05.415
And again,
my condolences.
