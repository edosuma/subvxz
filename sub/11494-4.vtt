WEBVTT

02:18.582 --> 02:20.498
Where you gonna go?

02:22.052 --> 02:23.218
South.

02:23.303 --> 02:26.254
What are you gonna do?

02:26.390 --> 02:28.089
Get warm.

02:35.432 --> 02:37.649
I was with you at Hardhome.

02:38.935 --> 02:41.269
We saw what's out there.

02:41.405 --> 02:42.771
We know it's coming here.

02:42.856 --> 02:45.273
How can you leave us now?

02:45.409 --> 02:47.909
I did everything I could.
You know that.

02:47.994 --> 02:49.243
You swore a vow.

02:49.267 --> 02:51.267
Aye, I pledged my life
to the Night's Watch.

02:51.581 --> 02:53.331
- I gave my life.
- For all nights to come.

02:53.450 --> 02:55.867
They killed me, Edd!
My own brothers.

02:55.952 --> 02:57.836
You want me
to stay here after that?

02:57.954 --> 03:01.456
<i>Riders approaching!</i>

03:01.591 --> 03:03.625
<i>Open the gate!</i>

04:37.354 --> 04:39.220
This is good soup.

04:41.725 --> 04:44.859
Do you remember those kidney pies
Old Nan used to make?

04:44.945 --> 04:47.529
- With the peas and onions?
- Mmm.

04:50.233 --> 04:53.151
We never should
have left Winterfell.

04:53.236 --> 04:56.037
Don't you wish we could
go back to the day we left?

04:57.991 --> 05:01.709
I want to scream at myself,
"Don't go, you idiot."

05:01.795 --> 05:03.878
How could we know?

05:03.964 --> 05:08.082
I spent a lot of time thinking about
what an ass I was to you.

05:10.053 --> 05:12.086
<i>I wish I could change everything.</i>

05:12.222 --> 05:13.338
We were children.

05:13.423 --> 05:15.056
I was awful, just admit it.

05:17.260 --> 05:19.644
You were occasionally awful.

05:19.763 --> 05:21.563
I'm sure I can't
have been great fun.

05:21.648 --> 05:24.432
Always sulking in the corner
while the rest of you played.

05:24.518 --> 05:26.351
- Can you forgive me?
- There's nothing to forgive.

05:26.436 --> 05:28.436
- Forgive me.
- All right.

05:28.572 --> 05:30.572
All right, I forgive you.

05:47.874 --> 05:49.757
You'd think after
thousands of years,

05:49.843 --> 05:52.427
the Night's Watch would have learned
how to make a good ale.

05:55.515 --> 05:57.131
Where will you go?

05:58.885 --> 06:01.469
Where will <i>we</i> go?

06:01.555 --> 06:02.707
If I don't watch over you,

06:02.732 --> 06:04.553
Father's ghost will come
back and murder me.

06:07.644 --> 06:09.277
Where will we go?

06:09.362 --> 06:11.863
I can't stay here,
not after what happened.

06:11.982 --> 06:13.982
<i>There's only one place</i>
<i>we can go.</i>

06:14.117 --> 06:16.200
Home.

06:17.487 --> 06:19.537
Should we tell the Boltons
to pack up and leave?

06:19.656 --> 06:21.289
We'll take it back from them.

06:24.377 --> 06:25.710
I don't have an army.

06:25.829 --> 06:27.912
How many wildlings
did you save?

06:27.998 --> 06:29.631
They didn't come here
to serve me.

06:29.716 --> 06:32.000
They owe you their lives.

06:32.085 --> 06:35.253
You think they'll be safe here if
Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North?

06:35.338 --> 06:37.722
- Sansa.
- Winterfell is our home.

06:37.841 --> 06:41.342
It's ours and Arya's
and Bran's and Rickon's.

06:41.428 --> 06:43.561
Wherever they are,
it belongs to our family.

06:43.680 --> 06:45.013
We have to fight for it.

06:45.098 --> 06:47.231
I'm tired of fighting.

06:49.152 --> 06:52.020
It's all I've done
since I left home.

06:52.105 --> 06:54.022
I've killed brothers
of the Night's Watch.

06:54.157 --> 06:56.824
I've killed wildlings.
I've killed men that I admire.

06:56.910 --> 07:00.361
I hanged a boy
younger than Bran.

07:02.866 --> 07:07.201
I fought and I lost.

07:11.041 --> 07:14.542
If we don't take back the North,
we'll never be safe.

07:16.346 --> 07:18.429
I want you to help me.

07:19.933 --> 07:22.550
But I'll do it myself if I have to.

07:25.605 --> 07:27.772
My lady.

07:28.858 --> 07:30.475
Ser Davos.

07:32.395 --> 07:35.480
Will you stay here at Castle Black?

07:35.565 --> 07:39.317
I will do
as Jon Snow commands.

07:39.402 --> 07:41.235
You serve Jon Snow now?

07:42.572 --> 07:44.622
He's the prince
that was promised.

07:46.376 --> 07:49.127
Forgive me, my lady, I thought
that was Stannis.

07:59.089 --> 08:01.222
What happened down there?

08:03.476 --> 08:06.477
There was a battle.
Stannis was defeated.

08:08.481 --> 08:10.598
And Shireen?

08:10.734 --> 08:12.266
What happened to the princess?

08:12.352 --> 08:15.069
I saw what happened.

08:15.155 --> 08:17.989
I saw Stannis' forces
defeated in the field.

08:18.108 --> 08:19.991
My lady,
I'm Ser Davos Seaworth.

08:20.110 --> 08:21.693
We've met before.

08:21.778 --> 08:23.528
I was Kingsguard
to Renly Baratheon.

08:23.613 --> 08:27.782
Before Renly was assassinated
with bloodmagic.

08:29.002 --> 08:30.585
That's in the past now.

08:32.121 --> 08:33.871
Yes, it's in the past.

08:33.957 --> 08:36.506
It doesn't mean I forget.

08:38.294 --> 08:39.594
Or forgive.

08:41.464 --> 08:43.097
He admitted it, you know.

08:43.183 --> 08:44.966
Who did?

08:45.101 --> 08:47.135
Stannis.

08:47.270 --> 08:49.387
Just before I executed him.

09:35.185 --> 09:37.351
The Defender of the Vale!

09:37.487 --> 09:39.103
Uncle Petyr!

09:46.029 --> 09:47.578
My lord.

09:47.697 --> 09:49.247
Come and see.

09:49.365 --> 09:51.999
I missed your name day.
Go on.

09:53.286 --> 09:56.370
A falcon!

09:56.506 --> 09:57.872
A gyrfalcon.

09:57.957 --> 09:59.423
The greatest and rarest
of birds.

09:59.542 --> 10:02.210
Last time I saw you, Baelish,

10:02.345 --> 10:06.547
you told me you were taking
Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers.

10:06.633 --> 10:07.882
Indeed I was.

10:08.017 --> 10:10.218
And yet not long ago,
we received reports

10:10.303 --> 10:13.387
that she has been married to
Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell.

10:13.523 --> 10:14.580
On our way to the Fingers,

10:14.604 --> 10:16.927
we were set upon by a large
force of Bolton men.

10:17.193 --> 10:18.956
Seemed to know exactly when

10:18.980 --> 10:21.297
we were traveling and exactly
whom we were transporting.

10:21.731 --> 10:23.447
Do you take me for a fool?

10:23.566 --> 10:26.400
Tell me, Lord Royce,

10:26.536 --> 10:29.904
how many people knew
of my travel plans with Sansa Stark?

10:29.989 --> 10:33.291
I shared my intentions
with you

10:33.409 --> 10:35.543
<i>and no one else.</i>

10:35.628 --> 10:39.413
Slander a man
in his own home,

10:39.499 --> 10:42.300
you might find yourself
crossing swords with him.

10:42.418 --> 10:47.054
Your home is the Vale.
The Lord of the Vale stands before us.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.924
And only his judgment
concerns me.

10:55.849 --> 10:58.015
<i>Shall we throw him</i>
<i>through the Moon Door?</i>

11:05.108 --> 11:07.191
My lord.

11:07.277 --> 11:11.863
My lord, I have always been
faithful to House Arryn.

11:11.948 --> 11:14.949
To your father, to your mother,
and now to you.

11:16.286 --> 11:17.535
Do you believe him,
Uncle Petyr?

11:25.845 --> 11:28.963
Lord Royce has served
the Vale well.

11:29.048 --> 11:32.800
He's enjoyed a distinguished
military career.

11:32.886 --> 11:36.437
If we could trust
his absolute loyalty,

11:36.522 --> 11:39.106
he would make a capable commander
in the wars to come.

11:42.695 --> 11:46.197
You can trust my absolute loyalty,
my lord.

11:46.316 --> 11:49.116
I think he deserves one more chance.
What do you say?

11:56.075 --> 11:57.708
Fine.

12:05.001 --> 12:07.251
I bring good news.

12:07.337 --> 12:09.921
My friends in the North
tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell.

12:10.006 --> 12:11.806
I expect she's headed
to Castle Black

12:11.891 --> 12:14.225
where her brother serves
as Lord Commander.

12:14.344 --> 12:18.512
But she won't be safe there,
not with the Boltons after her.

12:20.566 --> 12:22.433
She's my cousin.

12:25.188 --> 12:26.270
We should help her.

12:26.356 --> 12:29.023
That was my instinct as well.

12:29.158 --> 12:31.692
Our lord has spoken.

12:33.279 --> 12:35.196
Gather the Knights of the Vale.

12:35.331 --> 12:38.366
The time has come to join the fray.

12:42.588 --> 12:44.705
<i>You invite the enemy</i>
<i>into our city?</i>

12:44.841 --> 12:46.507
I did.

12:46.592 --> 12:49.043
As a clever man once told me,

12:49.178 --> 12:51.846
"We make peace with our enemies,
not our friends."

12:51.931 --> 12:54.882
I don't make peace
with the queen's enemies.

12:55.018 --> 12:56.100
I kill the queen's enemies.

12:56.219 --> 12:57.685
Yes, that's the military approach.

12:57.770 --> 12:59.353
And how has that worked
here in Meereen?

12:59.439 --> 13:01.722
I represent
the diplomatic approach.

13:01.858 --> 13:03.975
Our queen tried to make
peace with the Masters

13:04.060 --> 13:06.060
and they tried to murder her.

13:06.145 --> 13:09.063
We enter these negotiations
with open eyes.

13:09.198 --> 13:12.483
Trust me. My own recent
experience with slavery

13:12.568 --> 13:14.485
has taught me the horrors
of that institution.

13:14.570 --> 13:15.987
How many days were you a slave?

13:16.072 --> 13:18.072
Long enough to know.

13:18.157 --> 13:21.208
Not long enough to understand.

13:26.716 --> 13:31.252
I bought this dwarf
for a single gold honor.

13:31.387 --> 13:33.421
And somehow you've risen

13:33.556 --> 13:36.424
to the top of the
Great Pyramid of Meereen.

13:36.559 --> 13:38.342
It's most impressive.

13:38.428 --> 13:41.262
And now you speak
for the Good Masters of Astapor.

13:41.397 --> 13:43.731
Here's to reversals of fortune.

13:43.816 --> 13:45.399
We came here to meet the queen

13:45.485 --> 13:47.902
and instead we're greeted
by a dwarf and a eunuch.

13:47.987 --> 13:51.772
Let's make this simple, shall we?
Tell me what you want.

13:51.908 --> 13:54.825
We want you to leave
Slaver's Bay.

13:54.944 --> 13:58.612
Take your dragons
and your mercenaries and go.

13:58.748 --> 14:01.282
Queen Daenerys won't stay
in Meereen forever.

14:01.417 --> 14:03.167
Her path takes her westward.

14:03.286 --> 14:05.619
When we last met,
I offered her ships

14:05.705 --> 14:09.590
so she could return to Westeros
where she belongs. She refused them.

14:09.675 --> 14:11.792
She refused them because
hundreds of thousands

14:11.878 --> 14:13.844
of men, women, and children
still lived in chains.

14:13.963 --> 14:16.380
As they have
since the dawn of time.

14:16.466 --> 14:19.633
- Not anymore.
- You think you're a free man now?

14:19.769 --> 14:21.602
You still follow orders.

14:21.687 --> 14:24.221
Just because your master
has silver hair and tits

14:24.307 --> 14:26.057
doesn't mean she's not a master.

14:26.142 --> 14:29.610
Friends, friends, friends, please.

14:29.695 --> 14:31.111
There have always been

14:31.135 --> 14:34.063
those with wealth and power
and those with nothing.

14:34.317 --> 14:35.413
That is the way of the world.

14:35.437 --> 14:37.437
I'm not here to change
the way of the world.

14:37.453 --> 14:39.904
Slavery is the way of our world.

14:39.989 --> 14:43.491
You don't need slaves
to make money.

14:43.576 --> 14:46.460
There haven't been slaves in Westeros
for hundreds of years

14:46.546 --> 14:48.496
and I grew up richer
than any of you.

14:50.500 --> 14:54.168
But our queen recognizes
that she erred

14:54.303 --> 14:56.921
by abolishing slavery

14:57.006 --> 14:59.840
without providing
a new system to replace it.

14:59.976 --> 15:03.727
So here is the queen's proposal.

15:03.846 --> 15:06.680
Slavery will never return to Meereen,

15:06.816 --> 15:09.517
but she will give
the other cities of Slaver's Bay

15:09.652 --> 15:11.602
time to adjust to the new order.

15:11.687 --> 15:13.020
What does that mean?

15:13.106 --> 15:16.240
Instead of abolishing
slavery overnight,

15:16.359 --> 15:19.076
we will give you seven years
to end the practice.

15:24.200 --> 15:26.033
Slaveholders will be compensated

15:26.119 --> 15:28.869
for their losses,
of course, at fair prices.

15:28.955 --> 15:31.455
In exchange,
you will cut off

15:31.541 --> 15:33.290
your support for
the Sons of the Harpy.

15:33.376 --> 15:34.936
We do not support
the Sons of the Harpy.

15:35.044 --> 15:38.095
Fine, fine, but you will
cut it off all the same.

15:39.265 --> 15:42.216
I do hope you accept,
my friends.

15:42.351 --> 15:44.218
You will not receive
a better offer.

15:47.690 --> 15:50.524
Let us sail
on the tide of freedom

15:50.610 --> 15:52.860
instead of being drowned by it.

15:54.230 --> 15:57.314
And as a parting gift
to our honored guests...

16:06.292 --> 16:08.075
Give freedom a chance.

16:08.211 --> 16:11.545
See if it doesn't taste every bit as good
as what came before.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.360
My friends!

16:25.569 --> 16:27.696
Large sorry...

16:27.780 --> 16:30.574
...you wait so fat time.

16:32.568 --> 16:34.485
Perhaps I should
translate for you.

16:34.604 --> 16:36.187
<i>We speak the Common Tongue.</i>

16:36.272 --> 16:39.773
- Excellent.
- You met with the slavers today.

16:39.859 --> 16:41.275
<i>I did.</i>

16:41.360 --> 16:43.360
Our brothers and sisters
died fighting this scum.

16:43.446 --> 16:46.614
<i>Now you invite them</i>
<i>to our city and drink wine with them.</i>

16:49.285 --> 16:52.703
I imagine
this room was built

16:52.788 --> 16:55.839
so the rulers could
intimidate the ruled.

16:56.959 --> 16:59.710
But I am not your ruler.

16:59.795 --> 17:02.129
I'm not the Breaker of Chains.

17:02.215 --> 17:04.381
I'm not the Unburnt.

17:04.467 --> 17:08.685
And I am certainly not
the Mother of Dragons.

17:08.804 --> 17:10.804
You are a stranger here.

17:10.940 --> 17:13.857
So why do you represent
Meereen in these talks with our enemies?

17:13.976 --> 17:17.394
Because our queen
chose me as her advisor.

17:17.480 --> 17:19.613
Until she returns
from her travels...

17:19.699 --> 17:21.198
When does she return?

17:21.317 --> 17:23.733
Soon. You have my word.

17:23.819 --> 17:27.488
We don't know you. We don't trust you.
We know Torgo Nudho.

17:27.623 --> 17:29.540
We fight with him
against the Masters. We trust him.

17:29.659 --> 17:33.494
And that is exactly why Grey Worm
took part in these negotiations.

17:33.579 --> 17:37.214
<i>As commander of the Unsullied,</i>
<i>he knows how to defeat the slavers</i>

17:37.333 --> 17:39.049
and he knows when
it is time to make peace.

17:39.168 --> 17:42.002
You have made peace
with the slavers?

17:42.138 --> 17:43.484
<i>We offered terms.</i>

17:43.522 --> 17:45.524
And you, Grey Worm?

17:45.607 --> 17:47.443
You want to drink wine with these men?

17:47.526 --> 17:52.489
The men who tore us from our mothers' arms
and sold us at auction like cattle?

17:58.662 --> 18:00.873
I am a soldier, not a politician.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.250
But if there is a chance for peace...

18:03.625 --> 18:04.918
a just peace...

18:05.377 --> 18:06.795
we should take it.

18:07.755 --> 18:09.089
Missandei,

18:09.423 --> 18:13.343
you know what these men are.
How can you trust them?

18:14.094 --> 18:16.805
I do not trust them.
I will never trust them.

18:21.685 --> 18:24.772
But as a wise man once said,

18:25.731 --> 18:31.320
"We make peace with our
enemies, not our friends."

18:35.941 --> 18:39.360
- Do not use me for your lies.
- Those men respect you.

18:39.445 --> 18:41.729
They respect me
because they know who I am.

18:41.864 --> 18:43.864
- They know I am loyal.
- As do I.

18:43.949 --> 18:46.233
I am loyal to my queen,
not you.

18:46.319 --> 18:48.202
If you betray her work,
you are my enemy.

18:48.287 --> 18:51.405
I am not betraying her work.
I am trying to save her city.

18:51.540 --> 18:53.957
You promised the slavers
they could keep slavery.

18:54.076 --> 18:55.242
For a short time.

18:55.378 --> 18:58.078
Seven years is not a short time
for a slave.

18:58.214 --> 18:59.663
You're right.

18:59.749 --> 19:02.216
Slavery is a horror
that should be ended at once.

19:02.301 --> 19:04.835
War is a horror that should be ended
at once.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.587
I can't do both today.

19:06.722 --> 19:08.138
You are wrong to trust these men.

19:08.257 --> 19:11.675
I don't trust the Masters.
I trust their self-interest.

19:11.761 --> 19:13.427
They're trustworthy
if they're convinced

19:13.562 --> 19:15.729
that working with me
is in their self-interest.

19:15.815 --> 19:18.682
You don't know them.
You don't understand them.

19:18.768 --> 19:20.434
We are not human
in their eyes.

19:20.569 --> 19:22.820
They look at me
and see a weapon.

19:22.938 --> 19:24.938
They look at her
and see a whore.

19:25.024 --> 19:27.775
They look at me and they see
a misshapen little beast.

19:27.910 --> 19:29.943
Their contempt is their weakness.

19:30.029 --> 19:33.530
They'll underestimate us every time
and we will use that to our advantage.

19:34.784 --> 19:36.700
You will not use them.

19:36.786 --> 19:39.503
They will use you.
That is what they do.

20:00.359 --> 20:02.276
You all right?

20:02.361 --> 20:05.612
Why don't you sit
and catch your breath?

20:05.698 --> 20:08.649
I'm fine.

20:08.784 --> 20:10.984
I don't think you
could ride the dragon.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.203
20 years ago, maybe.

20:13.322 --> 20:15.572
- What?
- Our queen.

20:15.658 --> 20:19.042
She's wild, you know.
Don't let her size fool you.

20:19.161 --> 20:21.879
It's hard enough for me
and I'm a young man.

20:21.997 --> 20:25.749
You, I don't think
your heart could take it.

20:29.255 --> 20:31.922
Must make you angry
that our queen chose me.

20:32.007 --> 20:35.175
Makes me sad.
You'll disappoint her before long.

20:35.261 --> 20:37.678
- She'll move on.
- We'll all disappoint her before long.

20:37.813 --> 20:40.647
We need each other right now.
After we're done needing each other...

20:40.733 --> 20:44.184
Oh, I don't want to fight you,
Jorah the Andal.

20:44.270 --> 20:45.986
What do I have to gain?

20:46.071 --> 20:48.739
If I win, I'm the shit
who killed an old man.

20:48.858 --> 20:51.992
If I lose, I'm the shit
who was killed by an old man.

20:53.746 --> 20:56.864
You didn't get much
discipline as a child, did you?

20:56.999 --> 20:58.699
None.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.458
The road running
through the Horse Gate,

21:07.543 --> 21:09.376
they call that the godsway.

21:09.462 --> 21:12.179
Eastern Market, Western Market.

21:12.264 --> 21:13.954
When Khal Drogo died,

21:13.978 --> 21:16.178
she was supposed to come here
and join the Dosh Khaleen,

21:16.552 --> 21:19.803
the widows of the dead khals.

21:19.889 --> 21:21.855
That's where they
would have taken her,

21:21.941 --> 21:25.142
<i>the Temple</i>
<i>of the Dosh Khaleen.</i>

21:33.235 --> 21:34.735
What are you doing?

21:34.870 --> 21:37.404
It's forbidden to carry weapons
in the sacred city.

21:37.490 --> 21:40.908
Isn't it forbidden to sneak into
their city and steal their khaleesi?

21:40.993 --> 21:42.876
If they spot us
and we're unarmed,

21:42.962 --> 21:45.412
we'll say we're traders heading
for the Western Market.

21:45.548 --> 21:47.164
But if they see weapons...

21:47.249 --> 21:48.966
You're asking a dog
to hand over his teeth.

21:49.084 --> 21:51.084
There's 100,000
of them down there.

21:51.170 --> 21:52.669
We can't fight our way out.

21:52.755 --> 21:55.506
We wait till dark,
and then we'll find her.

22:02.264 --> 22:04.181
Uh...

22:05.518 --> 22:08.569
I'm very attached to this knife.

22:19.331 --> 22:21.949
Don't worry.
It didn't touch you.

22:23.452 --> 22:25.536
You know what happens?

22:25.621 --> 22:27.337
I know what happens.

22:29.258 --> 22:31.091
I'll do it myself.

23:03.949 --> 23:06.816
I should have been
born a Dothraki.

23:34.073 --> 23:37.107
Come on.

23:37.167 --> 23:38.543
My friends...

23:39.002 --> 23:42.631
We wandered off from the
Western Market and got lost.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.884
Could you show us the way back?

23:45.967 --> 23:47.177
What do you sell?

23:47.260 --> 23:48.345
Wine.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.764
Come down to my stall tomorrow,

23:50.847 --> 23:54.518
I'll give you a cask of the Arbor's finest.

23:59.856 --> 24:01.691
You're not merchants.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.110
Get the others.

24:54.436 --> 24:57.404
Told you, I'm very attached
to this knife.

24:58.941 --> 25:00.440
You all right?

25:00.576 --> 25:02.743
If they find a body
with a stab wound,

25:02.828 --> 25:05.195
the whole city
will be looking for us.

25:26.635 --> 25:27.467
Huh.

25:33.366 --> 25:37.829
Some of them don't think Dothraki
should breed with foreigners.

25:38.246 --> 25:43.084
They are stupid old women. They don't realize
that we have always diluted our blood.

25:43.168 --> 25:45.128
This one is Lhazareen.

25:45.212 --> 25:48.423
Her Khal found her hiding in a well
after he burned her village.

25:48.798 --> 25:50.634
How old were you?

25:51.593 --> 25:53.261
Twelve.

25:53.762 --> 25:57.974
A year later, she bore her Khal a daughter.
How did he show his happiness?

25:58.266 --> 26:00.644
He broke my ribs.

26:02.312 --> 26:06.983
We are not queens here, but the khals
depend on us for our wisdom.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.319
Our lives have meaning.

26:09.486 --> 26:12.239
That is more than most have.

26:12.864 --> 26:16.076
When the khals meet
for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night,

26:16.159 --> 26:18.328
I hope they let you live out your days with us.

26:18.703 --> 26:21.831
The other possibilities are not so pleasant.

26:22.999 --> 26:24.668
I need to make water.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.546
You can't run from Dothraki.

26:28.838 --> 26:30.340
You know this.

26:30.423 --> 26:33.009
I will never run from Dothraki.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.096
Go, show her.

26:37.847 --> 26:39.683
I needed fresh air.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.685
The old women stink.

26:42.102 --> 26:43.645
They do stink.

26:44.771 --> 26:46.982
You must have been very young
when your Khal died.

26:47.065 --> 26:48.358
Sixteen.

26:49.317 --> 26:51.653
Too bad he didn't die sooner.

26:53.697 --> 26:55.657
Yes, too bad.

26:55.740 --> 26:58.159
Is it true you have three dragons?

26:58.727 --> 27:00.060
Mm-hmm.

27:01.705 --> 27:03.623
And they breathe fire?

27:03.707 --> 27:04.874
They do.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.711
Would you like to see them one day?

27:08.378 --> 27:10.213
I am Dosh Khaleen.

27:10.297 --> 27:15.051
I can never leave Vaes Dothrak, until I rise
as smoke from the pyre on the day I die.

27:15.711 --> 27:17.878
- No, don't hurt her.
- She'll give us away.

27:17.963 --> 27:19.713
We have to go now.

27:24.503 --> 27:27.220
We will never get out
of Vaes Dothrak alive.

27:27.306 --> 27:29.723
All we can do is try.

27:29.808 --> 27:32.008
No.

27:32.094 --> 27:34.311
We can do more than that.

27:34.429 --> 27:36.012
And you're going
to help me.

27:38.908 --> 27:40.035
And you...

27:40.535 --> 27:42.203
Have faith in me, Khaleesi.

27:42.412 --> 27:44.247
Do not betray me.

28:45.417 --> 28:49.169
If I were to let you leave right now,
where would you go?

28:49.254 --> 28:51.922
-<i> What would you seek out?</i>

28:53.842 --> 28:56.343
I'd go to my brother,

28:56.478 --> 28:57.928
my husband, my family.

28:58.013 --> 29:02.148
Of course, but for you,
that means seeking out money,

29:02.234 --> 29:05.101
finery, power.

29:05.187 --> 29:09.022
Seeking out your family
means seeking out sin.

29:09.107 --> 29:11.024
<i>I'm not maligning you.</i>

29:11.109 --> 29:14.027
I sought
those things out, too.

29:14.162 --> 29:16.363
To the exclusion
of all else.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.000
<i>My father was a cobbler.</i>

29:20.085 --> 29:24.254
He died when I was young
and I took over his shop.

29:24.373 --> 29:26.873
He was a simple man
and he made simple shoes.

29:26.959 --> 29:30.377
But I found that the more work
I put into my shoes,

29:30.462 --> 29:31.678
the more people wanted them.

29:31.763 --> 29:34.848
Fine leather, ornamentation,

29:34.933 --> 29:38.802
detailing, and time.

29:38.887 --> 29:40.603
Time most of all.

29:40.722 --> 29:43.306
Dozens of hours
spent on a single pair.

29:43.392 --> 29:45.141
Quality takes time.

29:45.227 --> 29:47.193
Yes.

29:47.279 --> 29:49.362
I imagine you've worn a year

29:49.448 --> 29:52.399
of someone's life on your back.

29:52.534 --> 29:54.868
<i>The highborn liked to cover</i>
<i>their feet with my time</i>

29:54.953 --> 29:57.954
and they paid well
for the privilege.

29:58.073 --> 29:59.622
I used their money

29:59.741 --> 30:02.459
to buy a taste
of their lives for myself.

30:02.577 --> 30:04.711
<i>Each time I indulged,</i>

30:04.796 --> 30:08.915
I felt myself ascending
to something better.

30:09.001 --> 30:11.001
And one day you walked
through a graveyard

30:11.086 --> 30:12.802
and realized it was
all for nothing

30:12.921 --> 30:15.422
and set out on the path
to righteousness.

30:15.557 --> 30:18.141
Book of the Stranger, verse 25.

30:18.260 --> 30:20.760
You know "The Seven-Pointed Star."

30:20.896 --> 30:23.563
Septa Unella reads it to me.
At me.

30:23.648 --> 30:27.484
Yes, yes, she does enjoy
reading at people.

30:29.187 --> 30:30.603
You're close.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.773
But it wasn't a graveyard.

30:33.859 --> 30:35.692
It was a feast.

30:35.777 --> 30:38.078
I bought old fine wine

30:38.163 --> 30:40.196
and young pretty girls

30:40.282 --> 30:44.000
and invited my friends
to come and share it all.

30:44.119 --> 30:47.504
<i>We passed around the wine,</i>
<i>passed around the women,</i>

30:47.622 --> 30:50.340
<i>and soon we fell into a stupor.</i>

30:53.628 --> 30:56.429
I woke before dawn.

30:56.515 --> 30:59.632
I could barely stand.

30:59.768 --> 31:04.471
Everyone else was asleep on
the couches or on the floor,

31:04.606 --> 31:09.225
lying in heaps next
to their fine clothes.

31:09.311 --> 31:11.778
The truth of their bodies
laid bare.

31:13.815 --> 31:16.649
I could smell them

31:16.785 --> 31:20.120
beneath the incense
and the perfume

31:20.205 --> 31:23.907
and the fine food that had
already started to turn.

31:26.044 --> 31:29.245
And I saw it
with perfect clarity.

31:30.332 --> 31:32.665
I saw what my sins were.

31:34.169 --> 31:37.003
The gold I had, the wine I drank,
the women I used,

31:37.139 --> 31:41.341
my ceaseless struggle
to maintain my position.

31:46.014 --> 31:48.264
It was all part of a story.

31:50.685 --> 31:53.736
A story I was telling
myself about who I was.

31:54.739 --> 31:56.322
<i>A collection of lies</i>

31:56.408 --> 31:58.358
<i>that would disappear in the light.</i>

31:58.493 --> 32:02.362
The people I was trying
to climb away from,

32:02.497 --> 32:03.947
the beggars in the street,

32:04.032 --> 32:05.582
<i>the poor,</i>

32:05.700 --> 32:09.452
they were closer
to the truth than I ever was.

32:09.538 --> 32:12.088
So what did you do?

32:12.207 --> 32:14.040
<i>I left to go and find them.</i>

32:14.176 --> 32:17.760
I didn't even put on my shoes.

32:17.879 --> 32:21.764
I walked out the door
and never went back.

32:27.522 --> 32:29.472
Come, let's go
and see him.

32:30.692 --> 32:32.976
- Who?
- Your brother.

32:49.077 --> 32:50.326
Loras.

32:56.751 --> 32:58.835
Loras.

33:17.739 --> 33:19.606
Listen to me.

33:19.691 --> 33:21.574
You need to stay strong.

33:24.996 --> 33:27.447
I can't stay strong.

33:27.582 --> 33:29.332
I never was strong.

33:29.451 --> 33:31.201
You are strong.

33:31.286 --> 33:33.620
You are the future of our house,

33:33.755 --> 33:35.121
the future of our family.

33:35.257 --> 33:37.790
- I don't care about that.
- Shh!

33:37.926 --> 33:39.676
Shh.

33:39.794 --> 33:42.045
Have you...
Have you told them that?

33:42.130 --> 33:43.630
That you don't care?

33:43.715 --> 33:47.717
I just want it to stop.

33:50.138 --> 33:51.971
Help me.

33:58.530 --> 34:01.314
They want me
to help you.

34:02.651 --> 34:03.933
They want me to help
tear you down.

34:03.934 --> 34:05.386
They want me to help
tear you down.

34:05.487 --> 34:08.456
That's why he's letting me see you.
I know it is.

34:08.556 --> 34:12.226
And if either of us give in to
what they want, then they win.

34:12.327 --> 34:14.027
Let them win.

34:15.964 --> 34:17.431
Just make it stop.

34:17.532 --> 34:19.733
Please.

34:21.002 --> 34:23.270
All right.

34:27.809 --> 34:31.645
<i>And now, how to avert disaster</i>
<i>with our current predicament.</i>

34:31.746 --> 34:33.914
<i>This High Sparrow.</i>

34:34.014 --> 34:36.984
<i>I have dealt with fanatics</i>
<i>of every description, Your Grace.</i>

34:37.085 --> 34:40.721
Not setting them off,
that's the most important thing.

34:40.822 --> 34:44.024
You are beset with enemies
both within and without.

34:44.125 --> 34:45.793
What are you doing here?

34:48.530 --> 34:51.931
I am advising the king
on our current predicament.

34:52.033 --> 34:52.976
Leave.

34:53.000 --> 34:55.000
I am a member of the small council.

34:55.504 --> 34:56.737
The king...

34:56.838 --> 34:59.473
Is this a small council meeting?

34:59.574 --> 35:00.841
Obviously not.

35:00.942 --> 35:04.044
I'm here to lend my wisdom
and my support.

35:04.145 --> 35:07.381
Thank you for your counsel,
Grand Maester.

35:07.482 --> 35:09.383
That will be all for now.

35:09.484 --> 35:11.252
Your Grace.

35:35.043 --> 35:38.579
Since I've missed
the past several small council meetings,

35:38.680 --> 35:41.448
I wanted to speak to you
about a few things.

35:43.151 --> 35:45.452
I've been thinking
about the High Sparrow.

35:45.554 --> 35:48.222
As have we all, unfortunately.

35:48.323 --> 35:51.225
We need to be careful
in dealing with such a man.

35:52.694 --> 35:55.129
To prevent things from
escalating any further.

35:57.265 --> 35:59.500
We have to be careful
not to antagonize him.

35:59.601 --> 36:02.002
He has Margaery.
We can't put her at risk.

36:02.103 --> 36:04.838
- He's dangerous.
- Look at me.

36:04.940 --> 36:06.774
What did they do to me?

36:06.875 --> 36:08.809
To the king's own mother?

36:13.381 --> 36:16.016
It's all right.

36:16.117 --> 36:18.552
It's done.
It's in the past.

36:18.653 --> 36:20.888
And of course

36:20.989 --> 36:23.691
Margaery's safety is paramount.

36:25.060 --> 36:28.929
You don't like Margaery, do you?

36:30.665 --> 36:33.767
Whether I like her or not
is completely unimportant.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.838
Margaery is the queen.

36:39.441 --> 36:42.543
Queens must command respect.
Kings even more so.

36:42.644 --> 36:45.446
Not just for their own sake,
but for everyone's.

36:47.415 --> 36:50.851
The High Sparrow has no respect for
kings or queens.

36:50.952 --> 36:52.786
No respect for anything
in this world.

36:52.887 --> 36:55.789
He has no use
for the things of this world.

36:55.890 --> 36:59.526
He wants to knock them down
and replace them with what?

36:59.628 --> 37:01.729
With fantasies.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.831
<i>With beggars in the street.</i>

37:03.932 --> 37:05.132
With nothing.

37:07.135 --> 37:08.702
Mother...

37:10.338 --> 37:11.972
there's something
I want to tell you.

37:13.441 --> 37:15.743
Something the High
Sparrow told me.

37:18.546 --> 37:20.247
You've spoken with him?

37:22.217 --> 37:25.653
I promised him I wouldn't tell anyone.
If he found out I told...

37:25.754 --> 37:28.555
It would be a breach of confidence which
he would not take lightly

37:28.657 --> 37:31.425
given his constant
prattling about the truth.

37:34.629 --> 37:37.064
I am your mother.

37:38.099 --> 37:40.134
You can always trust me.

37:48.109 --> 37:51.512
The small council meeting has been
postponed on the king's orders.

37:51.613 --> 37:53.973
I would have thought we were
perfectly clear the first time.

37:54.049 --> 37:55.245
<i>You're not welcome.</i>

37:55.269 --> 37:57.217
<i>You once spoke of your</i>
<i>respect for our father</i>

37:57.218 --> 37:59.953
because he understood the necessity
of working with one's rivals.

38:00.055 --> 38:04.858
My dear, you have been stripped of your
dignity and authority,

38:04.959 --> 38:07.961
publically shamed,
and confined to the Red Keep.

38:08.063 --> 38:10.297
What's left to work with?

38:10.398 --> 38:12.800
<i>Cersei is the mother of the king.</i>

38:12.901 --> 38:15.602
She has the king's ear
and his trust.

38:15.704 --> 38:17.638
And the king has been
speaking regularly

38:17.739 --> 38:21.141
with the High Sparrow
about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras.

38:21.242 --> 38:22.876
The High Sparrow seized power

38:22.977 --> 38:24.945
knowing full well
we'd bicker amongst ourselves

38:25.046 --> 38:26.747
instead of seizing it back.

38:26.848 --> 38:28.649
Here we are. Well done to us.

38:28.750 --> 38:30.851
Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms

38:30.952 --> 38:32.786
rests in his dirty peasant hands.

38:32.887 --> 38:35.656
In a few days, he'll have a trial for me.

38:35.757 --> 38:39.326
But before that, Queen Margaery
will make her walk of atonement.

38:39.427 --> 38:43.030
Yes, Margaery will repent her sins

38:43.131 --> 38:45.099
before the good people of the city.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.668
Oh, no.

38:47.769 --> 38:50.571
That cannot happen.

38:50.672 --> 38:52.473
That will not happen.

38:52.574 --> 38:54.241
I agree.

38:56.878 --> 38:59.780
You've got the second largest
army in Westeros.

38:59.881 --> 39:01.315
You'll bring them into the city,

39:01.416 --> 39:04.084
stop Queen Margaery's
humiliation before it starts,

39:04.185 --> 39:06.587
and take her back into Crown custody.

39:06.688 --> 39:10.424
The king has ordered me to take
no action against the High Sparrow

39:10.525 --> 39:13.627
or the Faith Militant out of fear
for the queen's safety.

39:13.728 --> 39:15.562
You will take no action at all.

39:15.663 --> 39:18.198
When the Tyrell armies come,
you will stand down.

39:18.299 --> 39:21.969
<i>Are you expressly</i>
<i>forbidden from standing down?</i>

39:22.070 --> 39:24.938
No, but if the King
should call...

39:25.039 --> 39:27.808
The whole thing will be over before
anyone can call on you to do anything.

39:27.909 --> 39:32.045
When the High Sparrow is in custody
or dead, preferably,

39:32.147 --> 39:34.681
and Margaery's back at Tommen's side,

39:34.783 --> 39:36.884
do you think the King
will be angry at the outcome?

39:36.985 --> 39:39.720
You hate these fanatics
as much as we do.

39:39.821 --> 39:43.090
You hate what they've done to your son.

39:43.191 --> 39:45.058
Do you want Lancel back?

39:45.160 --> 39:47.027
Or have you
given him up for good?

39:48.830 --> 39:51.064
Of course I want him back.

39:54.469 --> 39:56.069
Then stand aside

39:56.171 --> 39:59.373
and let the people
that took him from you be destroyed.

40:02.944 --> 40:04.745
If it doesn't go as planned,

40:04.846 --> 40:07.214
the sparrows have
many friends in this city.

40:07.315 --> 40:10.050
We'll have civil war.
Many will die.

40:10.151 --> 40:12.553
Many will die no matter what we do.

40:14.322 --> 40:16.056
Better them than us.

41:12.480 --> 41:14.848
They told me you were home
and I didn't believe it.

41:16.918 --> 41:19.653
"Theon Greyjoy?" I said.

41:19.754 --> 41:22.089
"He's dead."

41:22.190 --> 41:24.558
"He's been dead a long time."

41:27.695 --> 41:29.663
He let you go?

41:29.764 --> 41:31.231
I escaped.

41:33.768 --> 41:35.602
I can't hear you.

41:35.703 --> 41:37.371
I escaped.

41:39.707 --> 41:41.475
Look at me.

41:50.151 --> 41:51.551
Look at me.

41:53.021 --> 41:55.656
Men died trying to rescue you.

41:55.757 --> 41:57.357
Good men.

41:57.458 --> 41:58.926
My men.

42:00.395 --> 42:02.029
I'm sorry.

42:02.130 --> 42:04.164
You were my brother.

42:04.265 --> 42:07.301
You were a spoiled little cunt,
but you were my brother

42:07.402 --> 42:09.369
and I risked everything for you

42:09.470 --> 42:10.837
and you betrayed me.

42:10.939 --> 42:13.106
I know.
I know and I'm sorry.

42:13.207 --> 42:14.508
Stop saying that.

42:15.576 --> 42:16.810
He broke me.

42:16.911 --> 42:19.613
He broke me into 1,000 pieces.

42:19.714 --> 42:21.081
- I know.
- You don't know.

42:21.182 --> 42:23.684
He sent us one of those pieces.

42:23.785 --> 42:25.752
That's why I came for you.

42:31.793 --> 42:33.694
Why did you come here?

42:33.795 --> 42:35.395
Where else could I go?

42:35.496 --> 42:39.199
You heard Father was dead and you thought
you'd claim the crown?

42:39.300 --> 42:41.268
No, no. I only heard he died
after we docked.

42:41.369 --> 42:44.271
You happen to show up
on Pyke right before the kingsmoot?

42:44.372 --> 42:45.839
I didn't know.

42:48.843 --> 42:52.045
You think any ironborn
wants you to be king

42:52.146 --> 42:53.947
after what you've done?

42:54.048 --> 42:56.016
I don't want to be king.

42:56.117 --> 42:59.353
What do you want?

42:59.454 --> 43:01.494
I should have listened to you.
You're the only one...

43:01.589 --> 43:03.924
That doesn't matter anymore.
Stop crying.

43:04.025 --> 43:06.026
Look at me.

43:06.127 --> 43:09.296
Tell me what you want.

43:13.668 --> 43:16.336
You should rule the Iron Islands.

43:17.605 --> 43:19.573
Let me help you.

43:46.300 --> 43:48.402
They've cleaned you up nicely.

43:50.638 --> 43:52.406
You know who I am?

43:54.008 --> 43:55.208
A lord.

43:55.309 --> 43:57.244
Yes.

43:57.345 --> 43:59.913
A lord.

44:00.014 --> 44:01.948
You've seen my banners?

44:03.284 --> 44:05.419
The flayed man.

44:05.520 --> 44:08.355
Does that worry you at all?

44:08.456 --> 44:09.956
You eat them after?

44:13.628 --> 44:14.861
No.

44:14.962 --> 44:17.964
Then I've seen worse.

44:42.123 --> 44:44.157
You served the Starks?

44:44.258 --> 44:46.793
Aye.
They put me in chains

44:46.894 --> 44:48.762
and put a sword at my throat,

44:48.863 --> 44:50.130
so I served them.

44:50.231 --> 44:53.600
The Starks have been
gone for a long time,

44:53.701 --> 44:56.470
but you kept protecting Rickon.

44:56.571 --> 45:00.073
He'd fetch a good price
to the right buyer.

45:00.174 --> 45:01.942
I served his family a long time.

45:02.043 --> 45:04.177
Didn't get no wages.

45:04.278 --> 45:07.414
Way I see it, I'm owed.

45:09.550 --> 45:12.152
Be that as it may,

45:12.253 --> 45:14.721
Rickon's not yours to sell anymore.

45:14.822 --> 45:16.490
He's mine.

45:16.591 --> 45:19.626
So what use could I possibly
have for you?

45:22.029 --> 45:24.364
I can give you what you want.

45:24.465 --> 45:26.700
And you're sure
you know what that is?

45:28.302 --> 45:31.805
Same thing men always want.

45:31.906 --> 45:36.109
And when they really want it,
they give it a bath first.

45:44.418 --> 45:46.686
You're a good talker.

45:48.956 --> 45:50.824
I like that.

45:58.399 --> 46:02.135
You're a much better talker
than Theon Greyjoy.

46:03.538 --> 46:05.338
That so?

46:05.439 --> 46:07.741
I had to work hard to get him talking.

46:07.842 --> 46:10.343
But he talked.

46:10.444 --> 46:12.112
They all do.

46:12.213 --> 46:14.981
He told me everything.

46:15.082 --> 46:17.918
All about the Stark boys,

46:18.019 --> 46:20.253
who helped them escape,

46:20.354 --> 46:21.688
and how she did it.

46:50.151 --> 46:52.052
<i>Open the gate!</i>

47:39.033 --> 47:41.134
Sorry about the food.

47:41.235 --> 47:43.270
It's not what we're known for.

47:43.371 --> 47:45.839
That's all right.
There are more important things.

47:50.845 --> 47:52.679
A letter for you,
Lord Commander.

47:54.482 --> 47:56.383
I'm not Lord
Commander anymore.

48:16.337 --> 48:18.872
"To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow."

48:18.973 --> 48:22.208
"You allowed thousands
of wildlings past the Wall."

48:22.310 --> 48:23.777
"You have betrayed your own kind."

48:23.878 --> 48:25.745
"You have betrayed the North."

48:25.846 --> 48:28.982
"Winterfell is mine, bastard.
Come and see."

48:30.584 --> 48:32.652
"Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon."

48:41.329 --> 48:43.330
"His direwolf's skin is on my floor."

48:43.431 --> 48:46.123
"Come and see.
I want my bride back."

48:46.124 --> 48:47.407
"Send her to me, bastard,

48:47.431 --> 48:49.703
and I will not trouble you
or your wildling lovers."

48:49.704 --> 48:52.806
"Keep her from me and
I will ride north and slaughter

48:52.907 --> 48:56.409
every wildling man, woman,
and babe living under your protection."

48:56.510 --> 48:59.157
"You will watch as I skin them living."

48:59.181 --> 49:01.181
"You..."

49:02.283 --> 49:03.917
Go on.

49:04.018 --> 49:05.819
It's just more
of the same.

49:10.691 --> 49:14.294
"You will watch as my soldiers
take turns raping your sister.

49:15.796 --> 49:17.097
<i>"You will watch as my dogs</i>

49:17.198 --> 49:19.799
devour your wild little brother."

49:21.836 --> 49:25.438
"Then I will spoon your eyes from their
sockets and let my dogs do the rest."

49:25.539 --> 49:29.476
"Come and see.
Ramsay Bolton, Lord of Winterfell

49:29.577 --> 49:31.311
and Warden of the North."

49:34.849 --> 49:38.752
Lord of Winterfell
and Warden of the North.

49:38.853 --> 49:41.755
His father's dead.

49:41.856 --> 49:43.390
Ramsay killed him.

49:43.491 --> 49:45.859
<i>- And now he has Rickon.</i>
<i>- We don't know that.</i>

49:45.960 --> 49:48.361
Yes, we do.

49:48.462 --> 49:50.964
How many men does
he have in his army?

49:53.033 --> 49:54.476
I heard him say 5,000

49:54.500 --> 49:56.512
once when he was talking
about Stannis's attack.

49:56.871 --> 49:59.239
How many do you have?

49:59.340 --> 50:02.275
That can march and fight?

50:02.376 --> 50:04.110
2,000.

50:05.413 --> 50:08.114
The rest are children and old people.

50:12.820 --> 50:15.755
You're the son of the last
true Warden of the North.

50:15.856 --> 50:19.492
Northern families are loyal.
They'll fight for you if you ask.

50:21.629 --> 50:25.832
A monster has taken
our home and our brother.

50:27.268 --> 50:30.270
We have to go back
to Winterfell and save them both.

50:42.666 --> 50:45.377
It is forbidden
to spill blood in the sacred city.

50:45.460 --> 50:48.755
It is forbidden
to carry weapons in the sacred city.

50:48.839 --> 50:50.632
So we don't spill blood!

50:50.716 --> 50:53.468
Well... there's always a little blood.

50:53.552 --> 50:56.805
Someone crushed his head with a rock.

50:56.888 --> 50:59.099
Aggo belonged to my khalasar.

50:59.182 --> 51:01.059
He served me well.

51:01.143 --> 51:03.520
He got his head smashed in by a rock.

51:03.603 --> 51:04.646
Fuck Aggo.

51:11.695 --> 51:13.655
Bring in Drogo's widow.

51:36.678 --> 51:40.015
Who cares about her? She's a midget.

51:40.098 --> 51:41.850
I like her.

51:41.933 --> 51:43.769
She's paler than milk.

51:43.852 --> 51:46.438
I'd like to know what a Khaleesi tastes like.

51:46.521 --> 51:47.522
Good.

51:47.606 --> 51:49.107
You can suck my dick.

51:49.983 --> 51:52.778
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen.

51:52.861 --> 51:55.280
The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her.

51:55.363 --> 51:58.241
They're offering ten thousand horses
in exchange.

51:58.325 --> 51:59.618
What's worth more,

51:59.701 --> 52:02.329
one pink little girl or ten thousand horses?

52:02.412 --> 52:05.749
Fuck the Wise Masters
in their perfumed asses.

52:05.832 --> 52:08.376
I'll take their horses for myself.

52:09.044 --> 52:11.588
Don't you want to know what I think?

52:14.341 --> 52:16.426
You'd rather be sold into slavery?

52:16.968 --> 52:20.138
Or maybe you'd like to show Rhalko
here what you taste like?

52:20.222 --> 52:21.598
No.

52:21.681 --> 52:23.475
I don't want either of those things.

52:23.558 --> 52:25.310
We don't care what you want.

52:25.393 --> 52:27.521
This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen.

52:27.604 --> 52:29.189
You have no voice here,

52:29.272 --> 52:31.441
unless you are Dosh Khaleen.

52:31.525 --> 52:34.236
Which you are not, until we decide you are.

52:34.569 --> 52:38.114
I know where I am. I have been here before.

52:38.198 --> 52:42.994
This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced
my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World.

52:43.078 --> 52:44.996
And what happened?

52:45.080 --> 52:47.499
You trusted a sorceress, like a fool.

52:47.582 --> 52:51.211
Your baby is dead because of you.

52:51.294 --> 52:53.588
And so is Khal Drogo.

52:55.465 --> 52:59.469
This is where Drogo promised to take his
khalasar west to where the world ends.

52:59.553 --> 53:03.348
To ride wooden horses across the Black
Salt Sea as no khal has done before.

53:03.431 --> 53:09.354
He promised to kill the men in their iron suits
and tear down their stone houses.

53:10.021 --> 53:13.191
He swore to me
before the Mother of Mountains.

53:13.275 --> 53:15.527
And you were dumb enough to believe him.

53:15.902 --> 53:19.739
And here, now, what great matters
do the Great Khals discuss?

53:19.823 --> 53:21.992
Which little villages you'll raid,

53:22.075 --> 53:26.204
how many girls you'll get to fuck, how
many horses you'll demand in tribute.

53:26.288 --> 53:28.540
You are small men.

53:28.957 --> 53:32.127
None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki.

53:34.588 --> 53:37.048
But I am.

53:39.134 --> 53:41.511
So I will.

53:50.604 --> 53:51.980
All right.

53:52.606 --> 53:54.566
No Dosh Khaleen for you.

53:55.108 --> 53:58.612
Instead we'll take turns fucking you.

53:58.695 --> 54:02.532
And then we'll let our bloodriders fuck you.

54:04.784 --> 54:08.038
And if there's anything left of you,

54:08.622 --> 54:11.625
we'll give our horses a turn.

54:14.711 --> 54:16.755
You crazy cunt.

54:17.380 --> 54:20.800
Did you really think we would serve you?

54:27.182 --> 54:29.100
You're not going to serve.

54:29.184 --> 54:30.936
You're going to die.
