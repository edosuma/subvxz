01:02.367 --> 01:05.367
(mellow music playing)

01:21.633 --> 01:23.233
Well, Rose, what's all this?

01:23.300 --> 01:26.867
I made a sign so the president
would feel welcome.

01:26.934 --> 01:29.600
It's going to say,
"Welcome, President Bush.

01:29.667 --> 01:31.867
We're pleased to have you in our home.

01:31.934 --> 01:34.333
We're really thrilled
you're visiting Miami.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.333
We hope you have a good time
and a safe trip home,

01:37.400 --> 01:39.367
and good luck on running the country."

01:40.767 --> 01:42.533
It's catchy, Rose.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.800
You really want to do all that?

01:45.867 --> 01:47.500
He's only going to be here a few minutes.

01:47.567 --> 01:51.767
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:51.834 --> 01:53.900
More exciting than winning the annual

01:53.967 --> 01:56.433
St. Olaf
"Me And My Pet Look Alike" contest?

01:56.967 --> 02:00.900
Yes, but mostly because I don't have
to swim with a duck in my mouth.

02:07.233 --> 02:10.400
Boy, I am going to let the president
have it.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.133
What should I hit him with first?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.367
Inadequate funding for education?

02:14.433 --> 02:16.700
The plight of the hungry and homeless?

02:16.767 --> 02:18.533
Pollution of the air and water?

02:18.600 --> 02:20.200
The problems are endless.

02:20.266 --> 02:22.633
You can't talk like that to the president.

02:22.700 --> 02:23.734
Watch me.

02:23.800 --> 02:25.333
Sure, there are problems,

02:25.400 --> 02:28.600
but can't we just pray
they'll go away by themselves?

02:28.667 --> 02:29.734
You haven't.

02:30.834 --> 02:34.500
If you make a scene, this whole thing
will blow up in our faces.

02:34.567 --> 02:35.734
Why do you say that?

02:35.800 --> 02:37.667
Because something always does.

02:37.734 --> 02:39.166
Let me refresh your memory.

02:39.233 --> 02:41.834
We have the suntan lotion, chap stick,

02:41.900 --> 02:45.300
and half a dozen cheap,
tawdry romance novels.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.667
We have everything we need for the cruise.

02:47.734 --> 02:49.900
Girls, maybe we don't have
everything we need.

02:49.967 --> 02:51.133
What are we missing?

02:51.200 --> 02:54.600
We are going away for a romantic weekend
to the Bahamas

02:54.667 --> 02:56.567
with Jeff and Rich and Randy.

02:56.633 --> 03:01.900
It might be a good idea
to take along some... protection.

03:01.967 --> 03:03.133
What kind of protection?

03:04.934 --> 03:07.166
Two armed Pinkerton guards.

03:08.600 --> 03:11.133
No, Blanche is talking about, uh...

03:11.700 --> 03:13.200
A Nestle's crunch?

03:15.500 --> 03:16.367
One over.

03:17.233 --> 03:18.800
An enema bag?

03:19.433 --> 03:20.266
To the right.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.000
DentuGrip?

03:22.066 --> 03:26.200
Condoms, Rose.
Condoms! Condoms! Condoms!

03:26.834 --> 03:28.867
Calm down, lady.

03:28.934 --> 03:30.500
You just get out of prison?

03:34.033 --> 03:34.934
(Blanche) Girls...

03:36.033 --> 03:36.934
What do you think?

03:37.467 --> 03:41.533
Well, it's not a bad idea,
but I'm a little embarrassed.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.667
Oh, me, too.

03:42.734 --> 03:45.333
Embarrassed?
There's no reason to be embarrassed.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.367
These are discreet professionals.

03:47.433 --> 03:48.867
This is a private matter.

03:48.934 --> 03:51.800
Whatever we buy
is nobody's business but our own.

03:56.734 --> 03:58.700
I'd like a package of these, please.

03:58.767 --> 04:01.166
And, uh, I'll take these.

04:07.967 --> 04:09.533
And I'll take these.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.300
Now, that wasn't so bad, was it?

04:13.433 --> 04:16.233
Joe, I need a price check on some condoms.

04:19.667 --> 04:22.433
These three ladies here
want a couple of boxes

04:22.500 --> 04:24.834
of the "King George Prophylactics."

04:27.433 --> 04:29.967
<i>The lambskins or the ultra-sensitives?</i>

04:30.433 --> 04:32.400
Two of them have the lambskins

04:32.467 --> 04:35.033
and the blond has the ultra-sensitive...

04:36.233 --> 04:37.166
in black.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.266
Plumber.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.900
Could I see some identification?

04:48.300 --> 04:49.633
Come on in.

04:51.233 --> 04:55.033
You two are the proud parents
of the new Dolan standard lowboy, huh?

04:55.100 --> 04:58.266
Yes.
We're sending out engraved announcements.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.867
You probably want to get her
operational soon.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.200
She's quite a showpiece.

05:03.834 --> 05:04.800
Where do I install her?

05:04.867 --> 05:06.367
Well, actually, uh...

05:06.433 --> 05:09.533
Lou, we're going to install her ourselves.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.633
-Follow me.
-Hold it. You're not serious.

05:11.700 --> 05:12.633
Why not?

05:12.700 --> 05:14.600
You've got to be a man, for God's sakes.

05:15.900 --> 05:18.367
You know, to tell you the truth, uh, Lou,

05:18.433 --> 05:21.867
women are capable of more
than just cleaning these things.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.667
As long as you ladies are playing plumber,

05:25.734 --> 05:27.200
why don't you play moving man, too?

05:27.266 --> 05:29.000
Fine! Fine! We will!

05:30.200 --> 05:31.500
Was that a plumber?

05:31.567 --> 05:34.934
No, Ma. It was a little girl
selling girl scout toilets.

05:36.967 --> 05:38.633
You let a plumber get away?

05:38.700 --> 05:39.934
We don't need him.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.033
Like hell.

05:41.100 --> 05:42.200
I'm going after him.

05:45.266 --> 05:47.600
Come on, Dorothy,
let's move this little beauty.

05:48.567 --> 05:49.533
Okay.

05:49.600 --> 05:52.133
Wait, wait.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.834
No, honey, she won't budge.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.133
Oh, Rose, I don't think
we're gonna be able to move it.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.433
Dorothy, if the Egyptians
built the pyramids,

06:00.500 --> 06:01.800
now, we can move this toilet.

06:01.867 --> 06:06.233
Fine, get me 20,000 Hebrews
and I'll have it out of here in no time.

06:08.734 --> 06:10.767
Oh, come on.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.533
Gimme a minute. I'll think of something.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.166
I'd love you to meet my roommates.

06:24.367 --> 06:26.533
Unfortunately, they're not home right now.

06:27.967 --> 06:29.967
Dorothy, we've got to talk.

06:30.033 --> 06:32.300
-I owe you a big apology.
-For what?

06:32.367 --> 06:33.500
For what I said before,

06:33.567 --> 06:36.300
about you not knowing a thing
about plumbing.

06:36.367 --> 06:37.934
Dorothy, you're a genius.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.734
Ma, what are you talking about?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.767
I walk into the living room,

06:41.834 --> 06:44.300
and there's a toilet
in front of the television set.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.533
It's an old lady's dream come true.

06:52.834 --> 06:55.934
You wouldn't believe all the security.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.233
They have to have it.

06:57.300 --> 07:00.266
When the president comes to town,
it brings out all the oddballs.

07:00.333 --> 07:01.567
(doorbell rings)

07:03.266 --> 07:04.533
Hi, it's me, Stan.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.633
Oh, Stanley.

07:06.700 --> 07:08.166
What are you doing here?

07:08.233 --> 07:10.133
I'm glad you asked.

07:10.200 --> 07:13.467
Inside this box is my best novelty yet,

07:13.533 --> 07:16.333
and the perfect tie-in
to the president's visit.

07:16.400 --> 07:17.333
Ladies...

07:19.066 --> 07:22.600
The George Bush
"Point Of Light On A Stick."

07:25.433 --> 07:28.300
Dorothy,
every now and then it dawns on me.

07:28.367 --> 07:29.900
You had children with this man.

07:30.567 --> 07:32.567
-Stanley, get out.
-Wait.

07:32.633 --> 07:35.867
I just took a bath
on Daniel Ortega buttons that say,

07:35.934 --> 07:36.734
"four more years."

07:36.800 --> 07:38.033
(women) Out!

07:38.600 --> 07:40.400
I never know when you're kidding.

07:40.467 --> 07:41.934
(women) Out!

07:42.000 --> 07:42.667
Good one.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.700
I want you gone
before the president arrives.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.567
I'm a big fan.

07:48.633 --> 07:49.767
Maybe he'd like to meet me.

07:49.834 --> 07:52.600
I almost voted for him.
I would have if I could've registered.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.633
Those things go straight to the IRS.

07:55.266 --> 07:56.133
So could I.

07:57.200 --> 07:57.900
See ya.

08:00.533 --> 08:02.934
What did I ever see in that man?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.367
Don't blame yourself.

08:04.433 --> 08:06.033
You were young.

08:06.100 --> 08:09.000
You were just a girl who marries
the first guy who knocks her up.

08:09.300 --> 08:11.133
(doorbell rings)

08:11.934 --> 08:13.967
Gee, this is really cool.

08:15.100 --> 08:18.166
-I see you've met--
-Stanley Zbornak.

08:18.233 --> 08:21.667
Novelty salesman, your ex-husband,
father of your children,

08:21.734 --> 08:24.667
and if you don't mind me saying,
first-class yutz.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.600
Wow. They do know everything.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.266
We had to run security clearances
on everyone.

08:31.333 --> 08:35.200
Everyone passed except for you,
Mrs. Petrillo.

08:37.633 --> 08:38.734
I can't believe it.

08:38.800 --> 08:42.266
I spend one lousy night with Mussolini,
and I do mean lousy...

08:43.867 --> 08:45.300
And I'm marked for life.

08:45.867 --> 08:47.300
No, that's not it.

08:47.367 --> 08:51.734
Our records list you as both
Sophia Petrillo and Sophia Weinstock.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.333
Are you trying to hide something?

08:54.400 --> 08:55.767
Is there a Mr. Weinstock?

08:55.834 --> 08:57.166
Okay, okay.

08:57.233 --> 08:58.667
I'm tired of running.

09:00.100 --> 09:01.300
Where do I begin...

09:01.367 --> 09:03.667
Max Weinstock
and my late husband Salvadore

09:03.734 --> 09:06.433
were in the restaurant business together
in Brooklyn...

09:07.767 --> 09:08.734
Ma, what's the matter?

09:10.033 --> 09:11.800
Esther Weinstock is dead.

09:12.333 --> 09:13.433
We grew up together.

09:13.500 --> 09:14.700
She was my best friend.

09:14.767 --> 09:17.066
-Oh, honey.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

09:17.133 --> 09:18.533
What happened?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.667
She was fighting an oil rig fire
in the Gulf of Mexico.

09:21.734 --> 09:22.834
She was 88!

09:24.600 --> 09:27.867
It's great she was able to work
right up to the end.

09:33.066 --> 09:34.033
Sophia?

09:34.834 --> 09:36.700
Dorothy, do you hear a dog howling?

09:37.633 --> 09:38.600
Behave yourself.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.033
Hello, Mr. Weinstock.

09:40.100 --> 09:42.667
Oh, my goodness. As I live and breathe.

09:42.734 --> 09:44.100
Unfortunately.

09:45.233 --> 09:47.500
-You're little Dorothy Petrillo.
-That's right.

09:47.567 --> 09:49.367
You haven't changed a bit.

09:49.633 --> 09:52.133
Same gorgeous smile, pretty eyes,

09:52.200 --> 09:55.033
beautiful figure, long, golden blond hair.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.633
You have cataracts,
don't you, Mr. Weinstock?

09:59.367 --> 10:01.200
Since 1967.

10:01.266 --> 10:02.000
Let's go.

10:02.934 --> 10:06.700
Sophia, Esther would have appreciated
you being here.

10:08.667 --> 10:09.767
I loved that woman.

10:09.834 --> 10:12.700
She was the best, which is why
she deserved a better husband,

10:12.767 --> 10:16.433
instead of a miserable,
lowlife sleaze ball.

10:16.500 --> 10:19.834
Sophia, if you knew now
what I knew then...

10:20.600 --> 10:22.300
Ahh... so what?

10:22.900 --> 10:25.533
If you've got something to say,
spit it out.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.000
Don't push me or I will.

10:29.567 --> 10:32.166
There, I pushed.
Too bad you weren't on stairs.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.967
Ma, Ma, you're creating a scene.

10:35.033 --> 10:37.367
That was a long time ago. Forget about it.

10:37.433 --> 10:38.600
I can't forget.

10:38.667 --> 10:40.433
This man stole money from us.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.533
Our family went hungry.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.300
Ma, we never went hungry.

10:44.367 --> 10:46.133
Some nights I felt like dessert.

10:49.233 --> 10:52.767
Why don't we go out
and get something to eat?

10:53.333 --> 10:55.734
I'll ask Ma if she'd like to come.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.233
It'll do her good.

10:57.300 --> 10:59.967
She's been so depressed
since she returned from that funeral.

11:00.033 --> 11:02.200
She lost one of her oldest friends,

11:02.266 --> 11:04.533
and even though she made up with Max,

11:04.600 --> 11:06.200
she knows she'll probably
never see him again.

11:06.266 --> 11:09.033
Get her. We'll try to cheer her up.

11:09.100 --> 11:11.600
We don't want her getting sick over this.

11:11.667 --> 11:12.633
No.

11:13.333 --> 11:14.967
(Dorothy) Ma! Oh, my God!

11:15.033 --> 11:16.467
Dorothy, what is it?

11:16.533 --> 11:17.500
What, honey?

11:18.767 --> 11:19.834
Oh!

11:19.900 --> 11:21.834
Good Lord.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.433
Ma, what is going on here?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.300
Afterglow.

11:42.066 --> 11:46.033
(light music playing)

11:46.500 --> 11:50.500
So, let me see,
you and this Max Weinstock were--

11:50.567 --> 11:51.433
Getting it on.

11:53.266 --> 11:54.233
Thank you.

11:54.300 --> 11:58.834
Make it three times a night.
He'd like that and send me a copy.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.934
So, this was a casual fling?

12:02.000 --> 12:04.767
I'm not the "love 'em and leave 'em" type.

12:04.834 --> 12:07.000
I don't have the strength to do both.

12:07.467 --> 12:08.900
We got married.

12:08.967 --> 12:11.767
It was a lovely ceremony,
no thanks to Dorothy.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.734
Ma, I have to talk to you.

12:14.800 --> 12:16.400
Who's in charge here?

12:17.567 --> 12:18.767
Well, what's the problem?

12:18.834 --> 12:20.967
I'm the caterer. It's 2:00.

12:21.033 --> 12:23.567
The guests are waiting.
Why isn't the show on the road?

12:24.266 --> 12:25.533
Ma, I know you're in there.

12:25.600 --> 12:26.734
The wedding is off.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.567
She doesn't approve.

12:28.633 --> 12:30.200
She doesn't approve?

12:30.567 --> 12:32.333
Now, look here, stretch...

12:36.033 --> 12:37.700
I have 100 cheese puffs

12:37.767 --> 12:40.934
and a sensitive assistant
both on the verge of collapse.

12:41.667 --> 12:44.633
Whatever the problem is, overlook it.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.166
My mother did with my marriage.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.266
If you say something smart,
I'll slap you silly.

12:55.467 --> 12:57.100
Listen, this is a private moment.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.266
So, butt out, Rambo.

13:03.066 --> 13:04.700
I have a confession to make.

13:05.166 --> 13:09.367
Ma, I came here to beg you
not to get married.

13:10.066 --> 13:11.967
I didn't want you and Max together

13:12.033 --> 13:14.166
because it looked like
you were cheating on Pop.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.166
I know it doesn't make sense,

13:16.233 --> 13:19.000
but I still think of the two of you
as married,

13:19.066 --> 13:21.900
and I didn't want Max taking Pop's place,

13:21.967 --> 13:25.367
but now that I see the two of you
so much in love,

13:25.433 --> 13:28.133
I realize I was being selfish.

13:28.200 --> 13:33.800
Ma... Ma, I want you to be happy,
and I know Pop would, too.

13:51.333 --> 13:53.033
I love you, pussycat.

13:54.133 --> 13:58.400
This is more moving
than Susan Hayward's climactic speech

13:58.467 --> 13:59.567
in <i>I Want To Live.</i>

14:01.600 --> 14:04.133
You're ready to fly right out of here,
aren't you?

14:07.233 --> 14:10.033
Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant.

14:13.233 --> 14:16.667
Couldn't we get married
so I can get in on the hugging?

14:16.734 --> 14:17.533
Places!

14:17.600 --> 14:21.767
Sophia, honey, I want to wish you
all the happiness in the world.

14:21.834 --> 14:23.300
Oh, thank you, Blanche.

14:23.367 --> 14:24.600
And, Sophia,

14:24.667 --> 14:28.900
I want to offer you a traditional
Scandinavian wedding blessing.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.000
<i>Geflectaflauffin...</i>

14:31.066 --> 14:32.533
<i>Fleffin fluffin...</i>

14:33.233 --> 14:36.066
<i>Feffeta flingin, flufaffen.</i>

14:37.900 --> 14:39.000
I'm really touched.

14:39.800 --> 14:41.433
I'm also soaking wet.

14:44.734 --> 14:48.066
All right, one group hug,
and let's hit the road.

14:48.133 --> 14:49.734
Oh, Sophia.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.867
-Sophia, honey.
-Oh.

14:55.633 --> 14:58.633
(organ plays wedding march)

15:21.667 --> 15:23.066
Uh-oh.

15:24.033 --> 15:26.767
Either I mixed the Elvis list
with the wedding list,

15:26.834 --> 15:30.300
or everyone in Max's family
appeared on the <i>Ed Sullivan Show.</i>

15:32.633 --> 15:34.800
Who cares already? Let's just do it.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.400
We are gathered here today

15:39.467 --> 15:42.066
to join this man
and this woman in matrimony.

15:42.133 --> 15:45.367
-I just love weddings.
-Oh, me, too. Me, too.

15:45.900 --> 15:47.367
Think you'll ever get married again?

15:47.433 --> 15:48.600
Oh, I don't know.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.500
I don't think so.

15:49.567 --> 15:50.734
Me, neither.

15:50.800 --> 15:53.200
-How about you, Blanche?
-Oh, absolutely...

15:54.133 --> 15:55.900
If the right man ever came along.

15:55.967 --> 15:58.900
He'd have to have the body of Mel Gibson,

15:58.967 --> 16:01.033
the personality of Johnny Carson,

16:01.100 --> 16:03.200
and the financial resources
of Donald Trump.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.066
(chuckles)

16:04.133 --> 16:08.467
I have a feeling the three of us
are going to be together for a long time.

16:09.100 --> 16:12.367
And do you, Max, take Sophia
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

16:12.967 --> 16:13.667
I do.

16:13.867 --> 16:17.266
Then if no Elvis in this room
has any objection to this union,

16:17.800 --> 16:19.600
I now pronounce you man and wife.

16:19.667 --> 16:20.533
You may kiss the bride.

16:24.266 --> 16:27.266
(applause)

16:29.500 --> 16:32.633

16:32.700 --> 16:35.033

16:56.266 --> 16:58.100
Well, thank you, Mrs. Petrillo.

16:58.667 --> 17:00.633
By the way,
what happened to Mr. Weinstock?

17:00.967 --> 17:02.700
We found out we weren't compatible.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.433
Thank God it was before we had kids.

17:05.600 --> 17:09.133
All right, now that the Weinstock mystery
is cleared up,

17:09.200 --> 17:12.100
I only have one more question to ask,

17:12.166 --> 17:14.500
what organizations do you belong to?

17:14.567 --> 17:17.734
We have to make sure
they aren't a threat to the president.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.800
Well, I'm a member of the Sierra Club,

17:20.867 --> 17:23.900
and Blanche belongs
to the Daughters of the Confederacy.

17:24.433 --> 17:27.467
And I'm a member
of the Otto Club of St. Olaf.

17:27.533 --> 17:29.533
Actually, I'm an honorary member.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.800
My name's not Otto.

17:32.567 --> 17:35.467
I don't think that group
could be considered subversive.

17:35.934 --> 17:36.934
Subversive?

17:37.000 --> 17:40.533
As in, "Do you advocate the overthrow
of the government by force or violence?"

17:42.200 --> 17:42.867
Violence.

17:42.934 --> 17:44.200
Rose!

17:45.000 --> 17:48.900
There is one other organization
Rose and I belong to.

17:48.967 --> 17:51.467
We might as well tell him,
he'll find out sooner or later.

17:51.533 --> 17:56.567
That concludes the first meeting of
the Hunk-a, Hunk-a Burning Love fan club,

17:56.633 --> 18:02.000
but before we adjourn,
our secretary has a real special surprise,

18:02.066 --> 18:05.166
a genuine Elvis artifact.

18:05.233 --> 18:08.734
(women gasping)

18:09.600 --> 18:11.734
It's a partially eaten pork chop.

18:15.467 --> 18:17.567
He had beautiful teeth, didn't he?

18:25.033 --> 18:26.734
This has to be a fake.

18:27.433 --> 18:30.700
Elvis would never have left
this much meat on a pork chop.

18:32.100 --> 18:35.166
(laughs)

18:42.266 --> 18:44.133
Dorothy, you're out of the club.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.533
Meeting is adjourned.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.533
Thank you, ladies. See you next week.

18:48.033 --> 18:49.233
Thank you for coming.

18:52.934 --> 18:55.300
I hope you're not too upset over this,
Dorothy.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.233
I've just been thrown out
of an unauthorized Elvis fan club.

19:00.433 --> 19:03.900
I'll try to pick up the pieces
and go on with my life.

19:07.233 --> 19:10.133
There must be a support group
for people like me.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.166
We're sorry, Dorothy,

19:16.233 --> 19:20.300
but the bylaws clearly state
that any derogatory remarks about the king

19:20.367 --> 19:22.533
are grounds for immediate expulsion.

19:23.333 --> 19:25.600
Maybe you ought to join an organization

19:25.667 --> 19:28.066
that is a little less fanatical
in its devotion.

19:28.133 --> 19:30.333
Like what, Blanche, the PLO?

19:35.266 --> 19:37.100
Is anyone as nervous as I am?

19:37.567 --> 19:41.333
I can't believe I'm going to meet
the president of the United States.

19:41.834 --> 19:44.100
Oh, if I say something stupid, I'll die.

19:44.166 --> 19:46.400
Can we make a donation in lieu of flowers?

19:47.600 --> 19:50.867
Dorothy, you're not still planning
on saying those things to the president,

19:50.934 --> 19:53.200
-are you?
-Oh, absolutely.

19:53.266 --> 19:56.233
When he comes through that door,
I'm ready for him.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.867
Read my lips, I'm telling him off.

19:58.934 --> 20:00.800
I'm telling him off.

20:01.266 --> 20:03.700
It's not really fair
'cause I can hear you.

20:05.467 --> 20:07.533
Am I showing too much cleavage?

20:07.600 --> 20:08.400
Yes.

20:08.467 --> 20:09.867
Then I'm ready for him, too.

20:10.900 --> 20:12.667
-(doorbell rings)
-Ooh.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.000
Ladies, the motorcade is running late.

20:20.066 --> 20:22.567
The president won't be coming
into the house.

20:22.633 --> 20:25.333
He'll just be at the door
for a photo opportunity,

20:26.000 --> 20:27.800
so, Mrs. Devereaux,
you might want to cover up.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.633
(siren wails)

20:29.700 --> 20:31.433
Uhh! Here he comes.

20:33.767 --> 20:37.066
Mr. President,
I'd like you to meet Rose Nylund.

20:38.600 --> 20:39.867
Hello, Mr. President.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.600
Can I ask you something?

20:41.667 --> 20:42.900
(Mr. President) Well, sure.

20:42.967 --> 20:46.300
Is the oval office as hard to vacuum
as I think it is?

20:46.367 --> 20:47.333
(Mr. President laughs)

20:47.400 --> 20:48.467
Well, I don't know.

20:48.533 --> 20:52.166
There hasn't been a hoover
in the White House in 60 years.

20:52.233 --> 20:53.266
(Mr. President laughs)

20:53.333 --> 20:56.800
(laughing)

20:58.967 --> 21:03.867
That was a good one, Sir,
and this is Sophia Petrillo.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.900
(Mr. President) Well, thank you
for letting me visit your home.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.700
Where I come from,
when you visit somebody,

21:10.767 --> 21:12.033
you bring something.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.467
A marble cake would've been nice.

21:13.533 --> 21:15.467
-Sophia.
-What?

21:15.533 --> 21:18.133
This is the president.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.667
Then he should know better.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.700
-And this is...
-Blanche Devereaux.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.500
It's a real pleasure, Mr. President.

21:24.567 --> 21:28.266
You do have a lot of secret service men,
don't you?

21:28.734 --> 21:29.567
(all) Hi, Blanche.

21:29.633 --> 21:30.767
Hi, fellas.

21:31.967 --> 21:33.867
Thank you, Mrs. Devereaux,

21:34.333 --> 21:37.066
and, Mr. President,
this is Dorothy Zbornak.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.100
Dorothy, please.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.767
(Mr. President) Hello, Ms. Zbornak.

21:41.834 --> 21:43.867
Hi, uh... Oh.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.367
(man 1)
Ms. Zbornak is a teacher, Mr. President.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.066
(Mr. President)
Do you have any suggestions maybe

21:49.133 --> 21:51.934
on how we can help
with this education thing?

21:52.600 --> 21:53.467
Bush.

21:55.967 --> 21:58.400
(Mr. President) Well, it's good to know
we have your backing.

21:59.000 --> 22:01.600
-You want to let go of my hand now?
-I...

22:02.700 --> 22:04.166
I think he means right now.

22:06.266 --> 22:08.633
(Mr. President) Well, I hope
you've enjoyed this as much as I have.

22:09.767 --> 22:10.800
Goodbye, ladies.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.567
(all) Goodbye, Mr. President.

22:16.567 --> 22:20.367
(siren wails)

22:21.800 --> 22:22.467
(door closes)

22:24.834 --> 22:26.567
I think he got the message.

22:28.200 --> 22:31.200
(dramatic music playing)

22:34.533 --> 22:37.500
(closing theme music playing)
