<i>♪ O come, all ye buttful... ♪</i>

00:10.916 --> 00:12.916
Merry Anal Day.

00:12.916 --> 00:15.625
- And a Merry Anal Day to you, Mazola.
-<i>Grazie.</i>

00:15.625 --> 00:19.833
- And may the Lord bless your asshole.
- And the assholes of all your family.

00:19.833 --> 00:21.750
Ugh, this holiday is gross.

00:21.750 --> 00:25.958
Hey, Anal Day is when Hormone Monsters
celebrate the gifts of love, sharing,

00:25.958 --> 00:28.375
and loving to share butt stuff.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.375
Uh-oh! Caught beneath the cameltoe.

00:31.375 --> 00:32.916
Watch out.

00:34.625 --> 00:38.208
Ugh, I fucking hate jubilation.
Why did I let you drag me here?

00:38.208 --> 00:42.833
I thought it would be fun for you
to see the old gang, have some schmeg-nog,

00:42.833 --> 00:45.375
get away from all the Hitlers
for a minute.

00:45.375 --> 00:46.916
Emmy, Merry Anal Day.

00:46.916 --> 00:48.625
Oh, and Rochelle.

00:48.625 --> 00:50.125
You're, uh, looking well.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.916
Whatever.
I'm just here for the schmeg-nog.

00:51.916 --> 00:54.083
Petey-Pete, I got you something.

00:54.083 --> 00:55.541
Oh, you really didn't have to.

00:55.541 --> 00:57.583
Label maker tape.

00:57.583 --> 01:00.666
And it's PTH107B compatible!

01:00.666 --> 01:02.208
- You like it?
- It's perfect.

01:02.208 --> 01:06.333
"PT-blooh-bleeh-bleeh compatible."
I can't believe I fucked such a dork.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.458
I don't find that hurtful at all.

01:08.458 --> 01:11.541
Jesus, Rochelle. It's a party.

01:11.541 --> 01:14.333
Can you dial back the Hate Worm
just a little bit?

01:14.333 --> 01:16.625
Nope. I can't, I won't,
and I don't want to.

01:16.625 --> 01:17.583
- Oh my God.
- What?

01:17.583 --> 01:22.458
Whatever you do, Rochelle,
do not turn around, unless you wanna see--

01:22.458 --> 01:24.416
Dante?

01:24.416 --> 01:25.750
Oh God, she turned around.

01:25.750 --> 01:27.416
- Dante?
- That's right, everybody.

01:27.416 --> 01:29.166
Your favorite scoundrel is back.

01:29.166 --> 01:30.250
Son of a bitch.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.791
Oh, shit. Drama!

01:32.791 --> 01:34.875
Dante better hold on to his two dicks

01:34.875 --> 01:36.958
because Rochelle's
gonna rip another one off.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.416
I'd like to introduce everyone

01:38.416 --> 01:41.416
to the gorgeous souvenir
I picked up in South America.

01:41.416 --> 01:46.250
Here she is, the llama of my life,
my fiancée, Daphne.

01:46.250 --> 01:47.250
Daphne, hi.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.916
Who let this asshole into the anus party?

01:49.916 --> 01:51.833
Rochelle, I-I see you're angry,

01:51.833 --> 01:54.583
and you have every right to be,
after what he did.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.625
Damn right! I-- Hold up. He?

01:56.625 --> 01:58.416
The old Dante.

01:58.416 --> 02:04.125
I would love to apologize for what he did,
but I don't even know that jerk anymore.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.375
Yeah, Dante changed, from travel.

02:06.375 --> 02:07.500
- Daphne, hi.
- Ugh!

02:07.500 --> 02:10.041
Anyway, I'm in
a really good place right now...

02:11.125 --> 02:13.750
...and I'm ready for us to be friends.

02:13.750 --> 02:15.250
Friends?! Ah!

02:15.250 --> 02:16.958
Oh no! The ass tree.

02:16.958 --> 02:19.916
Rot in absolute shit, Dante. And you...

02:19.916 --> 02:21.666
- Daphne.
- Yes, Daphne.

02:21.666 --> 02:22.583
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:22.583 --> 02:25.291
You are a pathetic fuck-donkey!

02:25.291 --> 02:26.250
Rochelle!

02:26.250 --> 02:30.375
I can't wait for this marriage
to blow up in your stupid mule face!

02:30.375 --> 02:31.291
- What?
- Jesus!

02:31.291 --> 02:32.875
What the fuck did she ever do to you?

02:32.875 --> 02:35.083
- Shh, shh. Come here, baby.
- She is an innocent llama.

02:35.083 --> 02:36.375
Fuck that, Walter.

02:36.375 --> 02:39.291
Nobody's innocent, okay?
Everybody's a shithead.

02:39.291 --> 02:41.833
She's a shithead. You're a shithead.
Pete's a fucking dork.

02:41.833 --> 02:42.916
- Okay.
- You know what?

02:42.916 --> 02:44.708
I should've never invited you.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.125
No shit, shithead.

02:46.125 --> 02:49.958
Rochelle, enough!
Girl, you're ruining this party.

02:49.958 --> 02:52.500
Oh, good.
All my fucking favorites are here.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.791
No one else
is gonna say this to your face,

02:54.791 --> 02:59.125
but your little "I hate the world" routine
is gettin' real old.

02:59.125 --> 03:02.250
Haven't I been clear
that I don't give a shit what you think?

03:02.250 --> 03:03.625
I don't fucking need you.

03:03.625 --> 03:07.333
I don't need any of you.
Now get your tacky tits out of my way.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.500
Uh-oh, caught beneath the cameltoe!

03:10.500 --> 03:12.833
That means our buttholes have to kiss.

03:12.833 --> 03:14.000
Oh, honey.

03:14.000 --> 03:14.916
Yes?

03:14.916 --> 03:15.875
Never.

03:15.875 --> 03:19.875

"I'm ready for us to be friends."

03:56.833 --> 03:58.416
<i>-Nein!</i>
- I know.

03:58.416 --> 04:00.833
And after all of that,
who goes and takes his side?

04:00.833 --> 04:01.750
- Hope.
- Boo!

04:01.750 --> 04:05.291
She's all, "Hate's so yucky.
Everybody love everybody."

04:06.208 --> 04:07.916
Hope is delusional.

04:07.916 --> 04:11.916
"Everything is fun and nice.
Let's dance to my big chest."

04:11.916 --> 04:15.125
<i>Idiota.</i> This world is not fun, not nice.

04:15.125 --> 04:17.791
No, it's ugly, so act accordingly, bitch.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.750
Yes, smart girl.

04:19.750 --> 04:23.666
And at the end of the day,
that's what hate is all about.

04:23.666 --> 04:27.166
Ugh, I'm just so glad you guys understand
how toxic Hope is.

04:27.166 --> 04:30.250
We should wipe her
off the face of the planet.

04:31.333 --> 04:34.083
Sorry. I know,
that's kind of a go-to for me.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.166
- Hmm, I don't mind that idea.
- Yeah, me either.

04:37.166 --> 04:39.291
Humans would be better off without Hope.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.083
- Hell, without everyone except for us.
- Yeah!

04:42.083 --> 04:45.875
They keep us down here in the basement,
but we should be running this place.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.791
Hmm, interesting.

04:47.791 --> 04:49.791
Alice time. Gotta go.

04:49.791 --> 04:52.041
Hate strong out there, Hillhurst.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.791
I always do, General Malice.

04:54.333 --> 04:58.125
Hmm... Hillhurst is right.
We should be running this place.

04:58.125 --> 05:01.333
<i>Ja.</i> I'm sick of having
less than total power.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.125
But what are we gonna do about it,
General Malice?

05:04.125 --> 05:07.208
Oh, I tell you what we're going to do.

05:07.208 --> 05:12.166
We're going to crash
a little Anal Day party.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.291
Let's go!

05:16.291 --> 05:18.708
Oh, sweetheart, you're gonna love it.

05:18.708 --> 05:20.458
It's sweet. You... Mm-mm!

05:20.458 --> 05:22.416
- Sorry, pardon--
- Oh! Uh... Uh... Oh.

05:22.416 --> 05:24.250
- Hello.
- Um, uh, hi.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.541
So, what's-- What's new with you, Pete?

05:26.541 --> 05:28.625
Um, well, uh, let's see.

05:28.625 --> 05:31.875
I, uh, bumped into your severed dick
the other day.

05:31.875 --> 05:34.458
Shh! Not in front of Daphne. Shh! Jesus!

05:34.458 --> 05:37.666
She doesn't know I used to have three.
To her, two is a lot.

05:37.666 --> 05:42.166
Okay. Ending this conversation
could be fun, I feel, so goodbye.

05:42.166 --> 05:45.208
No, no, no, wait. You said you saw
my favorite dick?

05:46.208 --> 05:50.000
It's barely a story.
He's just, like, undead now or whatever.

05:50.000 --> 05:53.250
Just like a zombified penis who I battled
to become his equal or something.

05:53.250 --> 05:55.458
But I'm boring you.
Let's both mingle, shall we?

05:55.458 --> 05:58.291
Oh my God, my favorite donger is alive.

05:58.291 --> 05:59.583
It's...

05:59.583 --> 06:01.916
it's an Anal Day miracle.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.041
Come on, honey. Loosen up in there.

06:05.041 --> 06:06.208
Oh, Montel!

06:06.208 --> 06:08.708
Aren't you gonna help Mommy
stuff goodies into my ass

06:08.708 --> 06:10.916
for me to crap out
at the stroke of midnight?

06:10.916 --> 06:13.708
I'm sorry, I-I just--
I can't with Anal Day.

06:13.708 --> 06:15.708
Yes, I quite agree.

06:15.708 --> 06:19.250
Oh, do you? Do you "quite"?
You crumpet fuck.

06:19.250 --> 06:23.250
I do, my recent sexual conquests.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.416
- Uck!
- Get off me.

06:24.416 --> 06:26.166
I disavow that threesome.

06:26.166 --> 06:28.333
Even if I do find you fucking scrumptious.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.791
- What?
- Scrumptious, you say?

06:29.791 --> 06:33.041
What? No, nothing. Is the ass tree
on fire again? I'm gonna go check.

06:33.041 --> 06:36.375
So, uh, do you want your own cookie
or are we, uh, sharin'?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.750
Sharin'? Sharon! God. Holy shit!

06:38.750 --> 06:42.500
I forgot to buy Sharon an Anal Day gift.
I'm such a nancy.

06:42.500 --> 06:44.583
Nancy... [gasps] Nancy!

06:44.583 --> 06:47.958
- Damn it! I forgot to buy one for Nancy.
- We're idiots, Joe.

06:47.958 --> 06:50.916
And we can't go to a store
this late on Anal Eve.

06:50.916 --> 06:52.625
The crowds we'd endure.

06:52.625 --> 06:56.333
You're right. Nancy's a fine wife,
but not an "endure something" wife.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.416
All right, I need a gift. I need a thing.
Where are things? The supply closet!

07:00.416 --> 07:04.416
Great idea. I'll get her a stapler.
Maybe a box of binder clips.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.500
If she wants a better gift, she can work.

07:07.958 --> 07:09.583
Hey. Where the hell are you going?

07:09.583 --> 07:12.625
- To talk to Sal's class.
- You're going to Sal's class?

07:12.625 --> 07:13.541
Uh-uh!

07:13.541 --> 07:16.416
- Alice, we said--
- Fuck everybody, I know.

07:16.416 --> 07:18.708
But Sal's teacher said he's being bullied.

07:18.708 --> 07:21.750
Who cares?
Fuck everybody means fuck everybody.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.291
But this is Sal, the cute motherfucker.

07:24.291 --> 07:25.958
Sure, he's cute.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.875
But you've been helping people
your whole life,

07:27.875 --> 07:29.166
and nothing has changed.

07:29.166 --> 07:32.250
Because the world is garbage,
and it doesn't give a shit about anybody.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.000
Yeah, I guess
I do kind of agree with that.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.041
I know you do. So, fuck everyone,
including Sal. Right?

07:39.041 --> 07:42.083
- Right.
- Alice, I'm gonna need to hear you say it.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.541
- But, uh, he's four.
- Alice...

07:44.541 --> 07:46.958
Okay, okay, fine.

07:47.541 --> 07:49.833
- Fuck Sal.
- That's my girl.

08:07.708 --> 08:10.041
- Dead? Oh, no, no, no.
- Ahh!

08:10.041 --> 08:13.791
Turns out Anthony Piñata
doesn't need a head to live

08:13.791 --> 08:15.666
or to pop.

08:16.791 --> 08:19.125
So we'll just head in. Get it?

08:19.125 --> 08:21.541

08:22.583 --> 08:24.208

08:26.750 --> 08:27.708

08:27.708 --> 08:30.500
On your knees. Hate is in charge now.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.125
- Hands where we can see 'em.
- No funny business.

08:35.125 --> 08:38.000
We're doing a <i>Die Hard</i>.
You guys know the deal. Scream.

08:38.000 --> 08:38.916
Ah!

08:38.916 --> 08:41.083
Up to the bullpen. Go!

08:42.041 --> 08:43.958
No, not the sack!

08:49.625 --> 08:54.125
Ugh, uh, my phone is in my breast pocket,
you brute. I have no weapons.

08:54.125 --> 08:57.500
That's just label maker tape.
My label maker needs it.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.041
How dare you, on this sacred day?

09:00.041 --> 09:03.500
This? This is an affront
to all Judeo-Rectal faiths.

09:03.500 --> 09:08.083
Silence! I will kill you all if I hear
one more complaining or belly-ouching.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.166
- What do you Haters even want from us?
- Hate! Hate! Hate!

09:11.166 --> 09:14.291
New Jersey's about to become Hater Nation.

09:14.291 --> 09:17.250
Of course. They wanna keep us
away from humans.

09:17.250 --> 09:20.083
That's right. No love, no logic.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.208
Just pure hate on Earth.

09:24.458 --> 09:27.375
The bad guys, Joe.
They have no idea we're in here.

09:27.375 --> 09:30.583
I guess they just forgot
to check the supply closet.

09:30.583 --> 09:34.458
You know what this means, don't you, Joe?
We're the Bruce Willises.

09:34.458 --> 09:36.250
The-the-the Bruce Willi.

09:36.250 --> 09:39.583
Of course. The writers
let us escape the takeover--

09:39.583 --> 09:41.958
So that we could save the day.

09:41.958 --> 09:44.583
Action heroes! Wow!

09:44.583 --> 09:48.125
Okay. We just, uh, hop up
into the air vent, yeah?

09:48.125 --> 09:50.291
Yeah, that's what we do, and crawl around.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.750
Now, hoist my caboose,

09:51.750 --> 09:54.291
and don't be afraid
to get your thumb involved.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.666

09:56.666 --> 09:58.708
You struck brown.

09:59.708 --> 10:01.083
Rochelle!

10:01.083 --> 10:02.333
- Holy shit.
- Welcome back.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.500
- Is that Peg?
-<i>Ja,</i> well, that's the bottom part of Peg.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.458
We did it, <i>Fräulein.</i>

10:07.458 --> 10:08.833
Did what?

10:09.625 --> 10:11.916
Oh God. What the fuck?

10:11.916 --> 10:15.541
Can you believe it, Hillhurst?
We run this place now.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.833
Thank God. Rochelle, help us!

10:17.833 --> 10:20.000
Why would she help you?

10:20.000 --> 10:23.125
This was all
her delicious, despicable idea.

10:23.125 --> 10:24.791
- What? No!
- Rochelle!

10:24.791 --> 10:27.541
Usually, I am all for office drama,

10:27.541 --> 10:30.291
but, girl, this is terrorism.

10:30.291 --> 10:32.583
- You actually did it.
- We did it.

10:32.583 --> 10:35.583
Humans are finally getting
the hate they deserve.

10:35.583 --> 10:36.750
<i>What the fuck...</i>

10:36.750 --> 10:40.750
Glorious, isn't it?
They're fighting over the dumbest shit.

10:40.750 --> 10:43.541
Look how many stupid cantaloupe there are,

10:43.541 --> 10:46.375
and they still knife each other.

10:46.375 --> 10:48.208
Oh, shit. Sal.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.666
- Fuck Sal. It is exactly what you wanted.
- I guess it is.

10:51.666 --> 10:55.541
And HR Tri-State is only Phase One.

10:55.541 --> 10:58.250
Let me guess, Phase Two is the world?

10:58.250 --> 11:02.458
Yes. You see, you know me.
You know I don't like a lot of phases.

11:02.458 --> 11:06.416
Oh, I almost forgot.
I got you a present for tushy Christmas.

11:06.416 --> 11:07.750
Let's move, toots.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.291
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hope?

11:10.291 --> 11:14.500
Once we get rid of Hope,
hate will be unstoppable.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.208
I thought you should do the gun violence.

11:17.208 --> 11:20.833
- Me?
- Of course. You hate her most of all.

11:20.833 --> 11:24.916
- That's true.
-<i>Arrivederci</i> her ass for good.

11:24.916 --> 11:26.916
Yeah, she deserves it.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.166
Honey, you don't wanna do this.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.458
Shut up, Hope. Of course she does.

11:31.458 --> 11:32.750
Hillhurst, now.

11:34.541 --> 11:36.166
Rochelle, no!

11:36.166 --> 11:37.875
What is she gonna do?

11:37.875 --> 11:40.833
Rochelle, this is not who you are.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.375
Shut up.

11:43.250 --> 11:46.291
- What are you doing? You fucking snake!
- Run!

11:47.750 --> 11:50.166
- Get them!
- Not so fast!

11:50.166 --> 11:52.541
Just shoot everywhere!

11:53.250 --> 11:54.958
Oh, shit. My shoulder!

11:58.958 --> 12:01.708
I just did a slow-motion shoot and dive.

12:01.708 --> 12:04.000
Oh, man. Am I the Bruce Willis?

12:04.000 --> 12:07.083
Find the snake. Find them both.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.083
Holy shit, she saved Hope.

12:09.083 --> 12:11.583
I knew the old Rochelle
was still in there.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.208
Hey, Pete, isn't that...

12:14.208 --> 12:15.833
- My friend!
- My dick!

12:16.750 --> 12:19.208
- Sorry, that's, um, your--
- Not now, Daph.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.666
Hey, buddy. You wanna come
and untie your daddy?

12:22.583 --> 12:25.041
Hey, wh-wh-wh-where you going, guy?

12:25.041 --> 12:26.500
No, no, come here. Come to Papa.

12:26.500 --> 12:29.083
It's okay. Go to who you love most.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.916
Yes, the one you love the most.

12:32.958 --> 12:35.583
- What?
- Me? Really?

12:35.583 --> 12:37.916
Oh, this is sweet.

12:37.916 --> 12:39.833
Oh, this is bullshit.

12:39.833 --> 12:44.041
Um, excuse me, guards?
This, uh, this is bullshit. Um...

12:44.041 --> 12:46.416
- Look. The Rock's trying to escape.
- What the fuck, Dante?

12:46.416 --> 12:49.583
- Shut your traitorous Linda Tripp trap.
- You there!

12:49.583 --> 12:50.833
- Don't hurt him!
- Freeze!

12:52.708 --> 12:54.583
Maybe <i>I'm</i> the Bruce Willis!

12:54.583 --> 12:56.750
Oh, a tattletale, I see.

12:56.750 --> 13:00.291
So, what? Are you on my side, Mr. Snitch?

13:00.291 --> 13:02.875
On your... your... your side. Yes.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.083
Yes, I think you and I
could do great things together, General.

13:06.083 --> 13:10.583
Just set me free, hand me a gun,
and... [chuckles] ...I'm yours, baby.

13:10.583 --> 13:14.250
Wow, you do seem
like a hateful piece of shit.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.250
Just not the kind I like.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.666
Anthony, I don't like this one.

13:20.916 --> 13:23.375
Look, that puffy thing's hugging Dante.

13:23.375 --> 13:26.958
Or giving him a chiropractic adjustment?

13:26.958 --> 13:30.416
Hey, that's too hard.
That's a bad chiropractor.

13:32.416 --> 13:33.916
Oh God!

13:33.916 --> 13:36.833
They've killed off fucking Hugh Jackman!

13:36.833 --> 13:39.083
If he can die, any of us could.

13:39.083 --> 13:41.708
Now, look, I know
you guys don't like Lionel,

13:41.708 --> 13:44.125
and there's some weird sexual baggage--

13:44.125 --> 13:46.166
- There's no baggage.
- So much baggage.

13:46.166 --> 13:49.375
Regardless, we've gotta work together
if we're gonna get out of here.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.041
- Agreed.
- Aww! That's the Anal Day spirit!

13:52.041 --> 13:55.666
Wait, guys, I have so much stuff
stuck up my ass right now.

13:55.666 --> 13:58.750
There's gotta be something
we can use as a weapon.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.791
Oh, good. Connie, you're already up there.

14:00.791 --> 14:03.875
- Uh, that's not Connie.
- Oh!

14:03.875 --> 14:06.250
I hate how much I love it.

14:08.041 --> 14:11.625
Fuck, fuck, fuck! I'm so stupid.
Why did I shoot at them?

14:11.625 --> 14:15.416
- Because you're a good bug.
- I'm not good and I'm not a bug.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.625
- Hey, they're on this floor.
- Get those doors open.

14:18.625 --> 14:21.958
- Oh, shit.
- The-the-the hatch! It's the only way.

14:21.958 --> 14:24.750
Fuck, I really am the Bruce Willis.

14:24.750 --> 14:28.541
Ugh, all this duct crawling
is so tough on the knees.

14:28.541 --> 14:30.166
I hope we get an action sequence.

14:33.125 --> 14:36.291
Holy shit. We killed a henchman!

14:36.291 --> 14:38.250
Absolute Bruces.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.500
And he has a walkie and a gun.

14:40.500 --> 14:43.708
Oh, yeah. You know what to do, baby.

14:46.458 --> 14:50.625
"I have a machine gun now. Ho ho ho."

14:50.625 --> 14:52.250
Who the fuck sent this?

14:52.250 --> 14:54.208
And why is the gun still on his lap?

14:54.208 --> 14:56.708
- Wait, where's the gun?
- I thought you had it.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.958
- I was busy writing on the shirt!
- Shoot.

14:58.958 --> 15:00.250
Well, honest mistake.

15:00.250 --> 15:03.083
We're still Bruce,
and Bruce is undeterred.

15:03.083 --> 15:04.000
That's right!

15:04.000 --> 15:07.291
And, if I remember the movie correctly,
impervious to glass.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.041
- Oh, shit! I'm pervious!
- You need my help?

15:10.041 --> 15:11.958
- Okay. All right.
- I'm very pervious.

15:11.958 --> 15:15.416
There should be hedge clippers
next to the big bag of M's.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.333
I-I can't reach 'em. I'm tryin'.

15:17.333 --> 15:20.708
A little to the left--

15:20.708 --> 15:23.166
- Cool, so you got the hockey stick?
- I did.

15:23.166 --> 15:28.583
Now, observe as I use
my feminine Noah Wyles to lure a guard.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.416
Oh, guard.

15:30.416 --> 15:32.041
I have to pee-pee.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.458
Fine, but no period stuff in there
or I'll puke.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.250
- Die, shitworm, die!
- Give me that!

15:38.250 --> 15:39.583
- Ow! Shit.
- No!

15:39.583 --> 15:43.208
Ooh, Connie is not the Bruce Willis.

15:43.208 --> 15:45.166
- They're gonna get us.
- We are going to get them.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.208
- We're so fucked.
- They're completely fucked.

15:47.208 --> 15:48.625
No, we're not.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.750
We're gonna get out of here
and we're gonna beat those Haters.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.833
Will you stop with the hopeful bullshit?

15:55.208 --> 15:57.208
Come on.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.583
- Oh, shit! They're coming.
- Look! We can jump across.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.041
What? No, we can't.

16:03.041 --> 16:06.166
You're shot and bleeding,
and I have zero legs.

16:06.166 --> 16:08.958
I'm telling you, we can do it, Rochelle.

16:08.958 --> 16:10.750
How the fuck can you be so sure?

16:10.750 --> 16:14.958
I'm not, but I know that if we don't try,
we're gonna die anyway.

16:14.958 --> 16:18.291
Here you go. Some bombs for you guys.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.625
Fuck. Okay.

16:19.625 --> 16:21.083
- We got this.
- Maybe.

16:21.083 --> 16:22.250
Come on!

16:23.625 --> 16:26.750
Hope! Hold on.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.291
- Honey, I can't.
- You have to.

16:28.291 --> 16:29.791
I'm slipping.

16:29.791 --> 16:31.625
- Hope!
- Rochelle!

16:31.625 --> 16:33.666
No!

16:35.333 --> 16:37.666
- Hold still, bud.
- No, it's gonna hurt.

16:37.666 --> 16:39.666
No, no, no,
it's just a tiny piece of glass.

16:39.666 --> 16:43.083
- I don't like it. I don't like you!
- I prom-- It's gonna go--

16:43.083 --> 16:45.125
Hey! No biting!

16:46.125 --> 16:47.958
- I got it.
- You were right. Didn't hurt.

16:48.833 --> 16:50.083
Hope's gone.

16:50.083 --> 16:52.541
She's really... really gone.

16:54.625 --> 16:56.625
Anthony Piñata.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.791
Whoa! Whoa!

17:16.958 --> 17:19.875
Well, well, well. Trying to escape, huh?

17:19.875 --> 17:21.416
This displeases me,

17:21.416 --> 17:23.041
but also excites me

17:23.041 --> 17:25.416
because now we get to do punishment.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.416
You, step forward.

17:26.416 --> 17:27.791
- Oh God!
- No!

17:27.791 --> 17:29.833
They're just a child.

17:29.833 --> 17:30.875
- Oh.
- Oh, thank goodness.

17:30.875 --> 17:33.583
- Oh. Wait, what?
- Nothing to be scared of.

17:33.583 --> 17:36.625
You just have to kill one of your <i>amici.</i>

17:36.625 --> 17:39.166
Or else, you'll all die.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.458
Uh, what?

17:40.458 --> 17:42.791
- Uh, no, please.
- Have fun!

17:42.791 --> 17:45.500
I'm gonna grab some popcorn
and watch.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.916
Oh God, this is so fucked up.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.291
It is, but also...

17:50.291 --> 17:51.916
- I feel safe.
- No, of course.

17:51.916 --> 17:53.833
I'm not gonna shoot you.

17:53.833 --> 17:55.583
Oh, great. Parents are safe.

17:55.583 --> 17:57.541
- Well...
- What do you mean, "well"?

17:57.541 --> 17:59.750
I can't just kill my idol, Dad.

17:59.750 --> 18:00.833
- What?
- Oh, goody.

18:00.833 --> 18:05.666
Honey, please. You can't shoot the daddy
who birthed you from his bung-hole.

18:05.666 --> 18:08.083
I don't know what to do!

18:08.083 --> 18:12.958
Monty, you listen to your father
and murder your mentor right this minute.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.041
Fine, but Lionel deserves
a chance to speak.

18:16.041 --> 18:18.541
Lionel, is there anything
you'd like to say

18:18.541 --> 18:22.166
about why you should, um, you know, exist?

18:22.166 --> 18:24.791
Uh, me? Oh, uh, why-- Why should I exist?

18:24.791 --> 18:29.666
Well, well, if I perished,
my mummy would be so distraught.

18:29.666 --> 18:31.083
Oh, honey, no she wouldn't.

18:31.083 --> 18:34.458
Yeah, no, I know.
I guess I'm going to die then?

18:34.458 --> 18:36.958
<i>Allora,</i> what else is on?

18:36.958 --> 18:39.958
<i>Fuck you, you headless maniac.</i>

18:39.958 --> 18:42.208
- Oh my God. Is that--
- Rochelle?

18:42.208 --> 18:45.875
I give up. There's no Hope.
There's no point.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.333
Just pop me already, Anthony Piñata.

18:50.666 --> 18:51.875
Whoa!

18:51.875 --> 18:53.875
- Oh God, no!
- Oh!

18:53.875 --> 18:55.458
She's getting popped!

18:55.458 --> 18:59.541
Awww, they are so sad. How tasty.

18:59.541 --> 19:02.125
Please, tell Anthony Piñata to stop.

19:02.125 --> 19:05.958
Why, because you love her? That's silly.

19:05.958 --> 19:08.208
- She hates all of you.
- She doesn't hate us.

19:08.208 --> 19:11.875
Yeah, she's just been really mean
to us lately, especially Pete.

19:11.875 --> 19:15.250
But that's only because they boned
and it's complicated.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.708
Boned is sex.

19:16.708 --> 19:19.875
- Oh, did they?
- She doesn't need all this backstory.

19:19.875 --> 19:23.541
I know Rochelle loves us.
She's just in pain.

19:23.541 --> 19:26.541
Oh, yes, she's about to be.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.708
<i>Come on, Anthony.</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:29.208
Just do it already.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.500
Don't you fucking dare give up!

19:32.666 --> 19:33.625
Hope!

19:33.625 --> 19:35.208
- Yes!
- Wait, what's going on?

19:35.208 --> 19:37.416
- I think Rochelle's okay.
- No!

19:37.416 --> 19:38.708
But you fell.

19:38.708 --> 19:41.125
Yeah, but I had a little help.

19:41.125 --> 19:42.875
From me, the Zombie Dick!

19:42.875 --> 19:45.333
Rochelle!

19:46.625 --> 19:48.916
Hey, gorgeous! Over here!

19:50.250 --> 19:51.875
Get hard, baby!

19:51.875 --> 19:54.583
Get harder than you've ever been before!

19:57.375 --> 20:00.458
- That was harder than I've ever been!
- Oh, honey, I'm flattered.

20:00.458 --> 20:01.666
Oh, shit.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.333
Look!

20:03.333 --> 20:05.458
I'll handle this, Sweet Tits!

20:17.000 --> 20:19.500
This has been a weird Anal Day.

20:20.750 --> 20:22.916
- Rochelle?
- I thought you were dead.

20:22.916 --> 20:24.666
- What?
- I was ready to give up

20:24.666 --> 20:27.416
- and let him pop me.
- Honey, it's okay.

20:27.416 --> 20:30.916
No, it's not okay. Nothing is okay.

20:30.916 --> 20:34.416
I made sweet Alice choose hate.
I let down Sal.

20:34.416 --> 20:37.041
People are stabbing each other
over cantaloupes.

20:37.041 --> 20:40.208
And now, all my friends are gonna die.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.125
And it's all my fault.

20:42.125 --> 20:46.250
But it's not over yet, Rochelle.
You can still make things better.

20:46.250 --> 20:49.250
Just stop! You always say that.
But how can I trust you?

20:49.250 --> 20:51.000
Well, what's the alternative, baby?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.375
Despair? Hate?
How's that working out for you?

20:53.375 --> 20:55.750
Terrible.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.708
I hate being hateful.

20:57.708 --> 21:02.458
You don't have to be.
I know you, and I know you can fix this.

21:02.458 --> 21:06.083
- You really believe that, don't you?
- Always have, always will.

21:06.083 --> 21:08.791
- I love you, Ro-Ro.
- I love you too.

21:08.791 --> 21:12.833
I tried real hard not to,
but I can't help it. I do.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.125
- Oh!
- Ooh!

21:14.125 --> 21:16.958
Here she comes! I see arms.

21:17.500 --> 21:20.375
- And some wings too.
- I'm back, baby!

21:20.375 --> 21:23.666
<i>Sorry to interrupt
this touching moment, ladies,</i>

21:23.666 --> 21:28.416
but seeing that you're still alive,
I need you to come turn yourself in,

21:28.416 --> 21:30.333
or else the bitch gets it.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.666
- The bitch?
- <i>Uh, hi, Rochelle.</i>

21:32.666 --> 21:34.541
It would seem that I'm the bitch.

21:34.541 --> 21:38.583
Oh, you love your little sex friend, huh?

21:38.583 --> 21:40.875
Prove it! On the rooftop. Ten minutes.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.458
- Oh God.
- Uh-uh!

21:42.458 --> 21:45.750
We're not giving up yet, honey.
You still got Hope...

21:45.750 --> 21:47.458
and tape.

21:47.458 --> 21:50.208
PTH1-bleep-bloop compatible.

21:50.208 --> 21:52.666
Let's go, kid. Time to kill the wizard.

21:52.666 --> 21:55.416
O-Okay. Okay. [sighs] Ready, Lionel?

21:55.416 --> 21:59.166
It's been a great shame knowing you,
young Montel.

21:59.166 --> 22:00.500
- Aww.
- Bye, Lionel.

22:00.500 --> 22:02.583
- See you.
- Uh, safe travels?

22:06.166 --> 22:07.000
- Ew!
- Mm.

22:07.000 --> 22:08.833
- Why?
- Sick fuck.

22:08.833 --> 22:11.458
Ugh, Jesus Christ, what are you doing?

22:11.458 --> 22:14.458
I don't know. What?
I've never been a martyr before.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.416
Just-- Ugh, just stand over there.

22:16.416 --> 22:17.541
All right, all right.

22:18.750 --> 22:20.375
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

22:20.375 --> 22:23.041
I'd really like to be done with this.

22:23.041 --> 22:26.458
I know. I just need to say something
before he fucking croaks.

22:26.458 --> 22:29.541
- Okay, Lionel, the threesome happened.
- Maury!

22:29.541 --> 22:33.416
- And it was the best sex of my life.
- Okay, yeah. I liked it too.

22:33.416 --> 22:36.000
Oh-ho-ho, you guys!

22:36.000 --> 22:38.208
And even the gun thing
was pretty hot to me.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.666
So that's it. Go die now or whatever.

22:40.666 --> 22:43.000
All right, I'm ready for my murder.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.291
Not so fast!

22:46.666 --> 22:48.416
Bruce!

22:48.416 --> 22:51.166
- Drop the weapon.
- Yeah, sure, whatever. I'm just a temp.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.500
Freeze right there!

22:56.291 --> 23:01.166
Looks like y'all are outgunned,
so you might wanna outrun.

23:02.375 --> 23:03.791
Bruce! Bruce! Bruce!

23:03.791 --> 23:05.750
I'm alive!

23:05.750 --> 23:08.750
And you want to kiss me.

23:08.750 --> 23:13.000
You were only supposed to know that
if you were dead.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.833
- Well, we got all the bad guys.
- Yeah, we did.

23:15.833 --> 23:19.916
We definitely saved the day.
The episode ends here.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.750
You wanna suck on the <i>pistola</i>
while we wait?

23:25.750 --> 23:27.291
Ew! No.

23:27.291 --> 23:29.416
What psycho would do that with a gun?

23:29.416 --> 23:31.041
General Malice, behind you!

23:36.708 --> 23:39.333
I've missed these wings.
They really are very handy.

23:39.333 --> 23:42.250
Ah, you could have been
a great worm, Hillhurst,

23:42.250 --> 23:44.916
but now, just a dead bug.

23:44.916 --> 23:46.916
Bring it on, you hateful motherfucker.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.375
Oh, damn. Well brought.

23:50.375 --> 23:51.791
Drop the weapon.

23:52.291 --> 23:53.500
Rochelle, don't.

23:53.500 --> 23:55.750
You got me, Malice. Now let Pete go.

23:55.750 --> 23:56.916
Uh-uh-uh!

23:56.916 --> 23:58.875
Where is your busty friend?

23:58.875 --> 24:01.458
Right here. Just don't hurt him.

24:01.458 --> 24:04.458
Oh, oh, oh. "Don't hurt him."
Bo-bo-bo.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.541
Weepy, weepy, weepy. Finish them!

24:07.166 --> 24:08.583
No!

24:08.583 --> 24:10.791
- Oh, shit.
- We're too late!

24:10.791 --> 24:13.166
Wait. Where is your titty?

24:13.166 --> 24:16.291
Oh, you mean this?

24:17.250 --> 24:18.333
Titty bomb!

24:22.875 --> 24:23.875
Pete!

24:26.833 --> 24:29.000
- Jesus, he's heavy.
- I can't hold on.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.875
The pants! Lose the pants.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.500
Ah, no! Not the pants.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.375
So, as I do this, I should clarify,

24:36.375 --> 24:39.125
I do love you, Pete,
but just platonically.

24:39.125 --> 24:41.166
Yeah, great.
Just take off my fucking pants!

24:50.000 --> 24:51.416
- Hell yeah!
- We did it!

24:51.416 --> 24:52.625
Bye, Malice.

24:52.625 --> 24:55.208
I love you guys. I'm so sorry.

24:55.208 --> 24:58.416
- We love you too.
- We're just glad you're back.

24:58.416 --> 25:00.333
You look much better as a bug.

25:00.333 --> 25:03.041
- I'm glad you're back too.
- Thanks, Petey-Pete.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.291
Platonic? Girl, you fucking up.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.833
Hey, Alice, what you doing?

25:08.833 --> 25:11.083
Nothing. Nothing's worth doing.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.083
Yeah, I know I told you that,
but I was wrong.

25:14.083 --> 25:16.416
Whoa, Rochelle, you're--

25:16.416 --> 25:18.333
A big, beautiful bug again.

25:18.333 --> 25:22.041
And I'm sorry I made you so hateful.
That's not who you are.

25:22.041 --> 25:24.708
You are a bad bitch who helps people.

25:24.708 --> 25:28.041
No, you were right. The world is shit.

25:28.041 --> 25:29.541
Everything is hopeless.

25:29.541 --> 25:31.958
Yeah, about that.

25:31.958 --> 25:34.750
I know how scary it is
when Hope disappears.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.083
It's fucking awful.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.750
But hate can't protect you.

25:37.750 --> 25:41.208
It just makes you angrier and angrier
until you finally just wanna--

25:41.208 --> 25:44.000
- Give up.
- Yeah, but don't you fucking dare, okay?

25:44.000 --> 25:47.291
Because Alice Wong
has too damn much to do,

25:47.291 --> 25:48.958
and too much love to give.

25:48.958 --> 25:50.583
You're right.

25:50.583 --> 25:53.500
- I am a bad bitch.
- Hell yeah!

25:53.500 --> 25:56.041
I'm gonna take care of myself
and my community.

25:56.041 --> 25:57.708
Now, that's my girl.

25:57.708 --> 26:00.416
This shitty world
is lucky to have you, Alice,

26:00.416 --> 26:02.416
