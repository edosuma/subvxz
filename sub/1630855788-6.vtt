00:43.919 --> 00:45.128
<i>Any day now.</i>

00:45.879 --> 00:46.922
<i>Any day now what?</i>

00:47.506 --> 00:49.716
Till someone proposes.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.053
<i>Earth to Leese.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:55.764
- Earth to Leese.
- Sorry. What was that?

00:55.764 --> 00:58.642
We were just saying you're
the next one down the aisle.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.854
- Oh, no. I don't know about that.
- If you don't want Veggie, I'll have him.

01:01.854 --> 01:04.772
Well, you're basically married anyway.
What's stopping you?

01:04.772 --> 01:07.234
Nothing. It's just not the right time.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.821
Plus, Veggie would probably want to
get down to his ideal tuxedo weight, so...

01:11.321 --> 01:12.656
It's just Lisa being Lisa.

01:12.656 --> 01:15.909
You know what she's like. Has to make
everything so complicated.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.954
Did I tell you I saw Penny from uni?

01:18.954 --> 01:19.913
Spill.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.291
- Nose job, fillers, one boob.
- Shut up.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.918
- Oi! Lisa Osgood, where are you going?
- Just the loo.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.795
Okay. Well, hurry back,
'cause it's your round next.

01:26.795 --> 01:27.880
Okay.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.439
Hi. I'm Lisa Vedge.

01:45.439 --> 01:49.610
I am-- I'm Mrs. Vedge.

01:51.195 --> 01:53.822
- Vedge. Mrs. Vedge.
- Get out while you can!

01:53.822 --> 01:56.450
Don't listen to her,
Lisa Vedge! We're all rooting for you!

01:56.450 --> 01:59.119
If taking his name makes you
sound that unhappy, love...

01:59.119 --> 02:00.579
- I-- Yeah.
- ...I'd get out now.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.788
- Hey...
- Sorry. Yeah.

02:09.338 --> 02:10.589
Hi.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.966
- Yeah?
- Hiya. Can I get ten tequilas please?

02:12.966 --> 02:14.009
Do you want a tray?

02:14.927 --> 02:16.303
No. I'll just do 'em all here.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.395
- Hello?
- I don't feel good.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.814
Lisa? Where are you calling from?
Where are you?

03:09.398 --> 03:11.441
London. Somewhere.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.278
- Okay, that's a good start.
- Oh, yeah. I'm on a street phone.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.280
A street phone?

03:16.280 --> 03:18.824
Like when the phone is in
its own little greenhouse.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.742
A pay phone?
Why are you calling me from a pay phone?

03:20.742 --> 03:21.827
Exactly.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.579
Not exact--
Okay, I'll repeat the question.

03:23.579 --> 03:25.205
Why are you calling me from a pay phone?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.665
<i>I lost my phone.</i>

03:26.665 --> 03:30.210
And the worst part about it is,
I just don't even know where I lost it.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.380
Wait. But you remembered my number?

03:33.380 --> 03:34.923
Yeah, obviously, Danny.

03:35.883 --> 03:36.884
<i>Danny!</i>

03:36.884 --> 03:38.802
- Yes. Talk to me. What's going on?
- <i>Okay.</i>

03:38.802 --> 03:42.181
So, you know it was
my mate Gemma's hen night?

03:42.181 --> 03:43.807
- Sure.
- I might have had just

03:43.807 --> 03:45.767
a little bit drink-- Drank too much.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.102
<i>And then,</i>

03:47.102 --> 03:48.979
<i>I might have just passed out
for a little bit.</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:52.649
<i>But when I woke up,
they all must have thought</i>

03:52.649 --> 03:56.445
<i>that I went home,
because they all just left without me.</i>

03:56.445 --> 03:58.572
- Have you called Veggie?
- Yeah.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.701
But Veggie-- I mean,
nothing wakes him up when he's asleep.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.956
Look, focus for me please.
Where exactly are you now?

04:09.499 --> 04:11.793
Okay, I'm being honest, right?
Here's the thing.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.463
I just don't know.

04:14.463 --> 04:16.548
Okay, okay. That's fine. Don't worry.
Let's narrow it down.

04:16.548 --> 04:18.926
- Where was the club?
- Yeah.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.470
- It was in Hoxton.
- <i>All right.</i>

04:21.470 --> 04:24.556
- How long have you been walking for?
- Between 20 minutes

04:24.556 --> 04:26.266
and an hour and a half.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.269
Okay. Have a little look around.
Any street signs near you?

04:30.103 --> 04:32.231
Can you just, like, hold a second?

04:35.692 --> 04:36.818
Lisa?

04:39.488 --> 04:40.489
Lisa?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.202
Danny, what was I doing again?

04:45.202 --> 04:47.329
- Okay, look. This is how we're doing this.
- Okay.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.748
I don't care if you have to
steal it from a pensioner.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.708
You're gonna get yourself a phone,
drop me a pin.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.043
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.629
- What's a pin?
- It's where you are.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.509
- I don't see it.
- <i>No.</i>

05:00.509 --> 05:01.593
You're not meant to s--

05:02.469 --> 05:05.013
<i>Just find me a phone and send me
a text with your location.</i>

05:05.013 --> 05:06.598
- Okay. Yes.
- <i>Yeah</i>.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.476
What sh-- What do you want me to say?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.854
The message isn't the-- That's not-- No.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.398
Okay, just-- Send me a little text,

05:14.398 --> 05:17.109
-"Hello, Danny." Put that in it, okay?
- Well, okay.

05:17.109 --> 05:18.735
Look, I just wanna help you get home.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.237
So can you please
do this one thing for me?

05:20.237 --> 05:22.197
Yes... Maybe.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.574
- Great.
- Probably.

05:24.366 --> 05:25.576
That'll do. Okay.

05:26.076 --> 05:27.828
Call me back from this phone
in half an hour

05:27.828 --> 05:29.079
if you can't find another, okay?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.415
If I can't find another what?

05:31.415 --> 05:33.250
Lisa, you need to put money
in that street phone.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.710
No--

05:34.710 --> 05:35.836
<i>To call back, press 1.</i>

06:23.884 --> 06:24.760
Come on, Lisa.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.422
- <i>Hi!</i>
- Hey.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.715
Finally got-- You got a phone?

07:03.715 --> 07:06.260
- I did. This is Al's phone.
- <i>Am I on TikTok?</i>

07:06.260 --> 07:07.886
No, you're not. It's just-- just me.

07:07.886 --> 07:12.057
I'm in Al's shop.
Al has got a phone and he's got a shop.

07:12.057 --> 07:13.267
<i>Can you believe that?</i>

07:13.267 --> 07:15.853
- <i>I've had this shop since 1996.</i>
- <i>What?</i>

07:15.853 --> 07:20.357
- He's had this shop since 1996.
- Yes, I heard that bit. Where are you?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.775
I told you, I'm in Al's shop.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.068
Of course, Al's.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.904
I'll just look for that on the map.
Would you believe it? It is not there.

07:25.904 --> 07:27.865
- <i>That's weird.</i>
- It is quite weird.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.992
Yeah. Look, please.
Which part of London are you in?

07:30.576 --> 07:32.202
- Al--
- Yes?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.413
Sorry, where are we?

07:34.413 --> 07:36.623
<i>This is Well Street, Hackney, dear.</i>

07:36.623 --> 07:38.458
- Okay. Bear with--
- <i>That's good.</i>

07:39.376 --> 07:41.044
Yeah.
Okay, you're on your way home, kind of.

07:41.044 --> 07:42.880
- Am I? That is good news.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

07:42.880 --> 07:43.964
Yeah.

07:46.717 --> 07:48.468
- Okay. You can get a bus home from there.
- <i>Right.</i>

07:48.468 --> 07:51.972
It's like I was supposed to
come to Hackney

07:51.972 --> 07:54.099
so that this moment could happen.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.351
- <i>Do you know what I mean, Danny?</i>
- Sure.

07:56.351 --> 07:58.604
Okay, so two buses home from there.

07:58.604 --> 08:01.481
- <i>First one being the 253.</i>
- Oh, 253.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.650
Yeah. And the second being the 91.

08:03.650 --> 08:06.528
Ninety-one. Okay.

08:06.528 --> 08:10.741
- 253. Ninety-one. 253. Ninety--
- What are you doing?

08:10.741 --> 08:11.992
I'm singing numbers.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.994
<i>Numbers are actually
quite weird, aren't they?</i>

08:13.994 --> 08:15.412
Put Al on now, please.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.622
- Put him on.
- Hello.

08:16.622 --> 08:19.333
Hello. Sorry to bother you,
but I don't suppose

08:19.333 --> 08:21.376
you could help my friend there
get on the 253 bus?

08:21.376 --> 08:24.254
Yeah. The 253 bus
actually stops right outside my shop.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.632
- <i>I'll escort her onto it personally.</i>
- Thank God.

08:26.632 --> 08:27.841
Thank you so much. You're a star.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.093
<i>Right. Lisa, all is good.
Al is gonna make sure you get on that bus.</i>

08:30.093 --> 08:31.553
- Who's Al?
- Who's Al?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.763
Are you on a--

08:33.263 --> 08:34.097
Gone.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.413
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.957
- That doesn't look like home.
- No.

08:59.957 --> 09:02.584
- Bit of a mix-up on the old bus front.
- You got on the wrong bus?

09:02.584 --> 09:04.962
No. I got on the right bus
in the wrong direction.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.088
Okay. Well, that's easy to do.

09:06.088 --> 09:09.007
- Where are you now?
- Where am I again?

09:09.007 --> 09:10.175
Bermondsey.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.553
- Bermondsey?
- <i>Jamaica Road.</i>

09:13.846 --> 09:16.306
Okay. Where in Jamaica Road?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.225
- In a launderette.
- <i>What's the name of the launderette?</i>

09:18.225 --> 09:19.685
- Launderette.
- It's Launderette.

09:19.685 --> 09:21.353
- <i>Is it?</i>
- Yeah<i>.</i>

09:22.020 --> 09:23.146
This is Lena.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.899
<i>She is a lifesaver. She lent me her phone.</i>

09:25.899 --> 09:28.485
<i>Hi. Hi, Lena.
Thanks for looking after her.</i>

09:28.485 --> 09:31.154
Don't worry, sweetheart.
She brightens up this place.

09:31.154 --> 09:32.781
- <i>All right</i>.
- Thanks, Lena.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.575
- I'm gonna book you a cab.
- <i>Oh, no, no.</i>

09:34.575 --> 09:37.536
No. You can't yet.

09:37.536 --> 09:41.164
You see, there's a dryer, and we are
trying to work out what's inside it.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.250
And I think it's a giant man-pillow.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.961
Lena thinks it's a big bunch of bras.
We've put money on it.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.671
- How much?
- 150 quid.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.257
Lisa, no. I think Lena's trying to
take advantage of you.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.009
- What? No. Of course she isn't.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

09:52.009 --> 09:54.386
- <i>You need to leave immediately.</i>
- No, I can't leave.

09:54.386 --> 09:55.637
What if I'm right?

09:57.723 --> 10:00.392
I am starving though.
Maybe there's a kebab house nearby.

10:00.392 --> 10:01.476
How can you be starving?

10:01.476 --> 10:03.520
You've done nothing but
fill your mouth full of cookies all night.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.855
<i>I know, right?</i>

10:04.855 --> 10:07.024
<i>Pippa brought them to the hen party.</i>

10:07.024 --> 10:09.568
<i>And I don't know,
I must've just stashed them in my bag</i>

10:09.568 --> 10:10.986
<i>before I passed out.</i>

10:10.986 --> 10:12.446
Pippa brought cookies to the hen party?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.615
- Yeah.
- Don't panic. They're cannabis cookies.

10:15.199 --> 10:16.074
No, they're not.

10:16.074 --> 10:18.076
Lisa. Who brings a tin of biscuits
to a hen night?

10:18.076 --> 10:21.371
Pippa just really likes to bake.
I just don't think you really know her.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.047
Oh, my God.

10:30.047 --> 10:32.883
<i>Danny, do you think they're--
Do you think the biscuits got me stoned?</i>

10:32.883 --> 10:36.428
Yes. What are you doing?
Stop eating the biscuits.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.263
<i>Well, I'm sorry.
They're just very moreish.</i>

10:38.263 --> 10:39.848
- How many do you think you've had?
- Five or six?

10:39.848 --> 10:41.141
- <i>Five or six?</i>
- Maybe seven.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.727
- Okay, so eight then.
- <i>I think it's probably about ten.</i>

10:45.729 --> 10:47.940
Lena. Lena, it's stopping.

10:51.860 --> 10:52.694
What is it?

10:53.487 --> 10:56.532
I think it's a puppet. It's got a beak.

10:56.532 --> 10:59.409
Who washes a puppet
at two o' clock in the morning?

11:00.619 --> 11:03.288
Oh, my God. You're so right.
And what are they doing with it?

11:03.288 --> 11:05.541
<i>At that time?
That's just really creepy, isn't it?</i>

11:05.541 --> 11:07.543
<i>Shall I hang around
and see who it belongs to?</i>

11:07.543 --> 11:10.003
Definitely not. No, you need to go home.
Just wait there until I--

11:12.631 --> 11:14.800
- <i>Lisa. What? What's happening?</i>
- Just a sec.

11:48.542 --> 11:49.626
Get me out of here,

11:49.626 --> 11:51.044
it's boiling.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.588
No.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.681
This bag is stunning.

12:03.265 --> 12:04.308
<i>Lisa?</i>

12:05.058 --> 12:06.101
<i>Leese?</i>

12:06.101 --> 12:08.937
- Time for a cab?
- <i>I don't think I can.</i>

12:10.022 --> 12:11.690
Lena Zurawski?

12:11.690 --> 12:14.443
I'm arresting you on suspicion
of possession of a class B drug

12:14.443 --> 12:15.736
with intent to supply.

12:15.736 --> 12:18.071
- It's medicinal.
- You do not have to say anything.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.616
But it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned,

12:20.616 --> 12:21.992
anything you later rely on in court.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.077
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.247
Could you stand up, please?
Do you have any sharp objects on you?

12:38.675 --> 12:39.510
No.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.763
No. Danny, I think it can smell the drugs.

12:42.763 --> 12:44.431
No. Don't say that out loud.

12:49.061 --> 12:50.562
Just-- Can you speak to Danny?

12:50.562 --> 12:51.647
Yeah. Sorry, sir.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.398
I'm Danny-- Sorry, Daniel Gibson.

12:53.398 --> 12:54.483
Believe it or not,

12:54.483 --> 12:56.485
<i>there's a perfectly innocent
explanation for all of this.</i>

12:56.485 --> 12:57.569
Yeah.

12:58.362 --> 13:02.658
And the explanation is
that I was actually drugged

13:02.658 --> 13:04.451
- by my friend's baking. No.
- Nick her.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.371
And it wasn't even my fault-- No.
Please. Danny.

13:07.371 --> 13:08.914
<i>No, that's exactly what it is.</i>

13:08.914 --> 13:11.250
- Honestly. I'm a witness.
- <i>Danny, can you help me?</i>

13:11.250 --> 13:14.336
She didn't know they were drug cookies!

13:48.370 --> 13:49.872
- All right, Daniel?
- Yeah. Listen.

13:49.872 --> 13:52.291
Adam, I need you to drive me
to a launderette in Bermondsey.

13:52.291 --> 13:53.625
What? I'd love to.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.003
I love a road trip,
but my car's in the chop shop.

13:56.795 --> 13:59.840
Clipped a rickshaw and a person.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.178
Wait, are you going outside?

14:04.178 --> 14:06.388
- Yeah.
- Mate, that is brilliant.

14:06.388 --> 14:07.890
I-- No. Actually, I have to.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.474
- Lisa needs my help. So--
- Right. Okay.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.101
- Well, I am gonna order you a cab.
- No.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.686
If I wanted a cab, I'd order myself a cab.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.230
- What's the problem with a cab?
- I'll be in a car with a man I don't know.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.273
What if he talks to me?

14:16.273 --> 14:18.692
Right. Okay. Sorry, dude,
but what other option do you have?

14:18.692 --> 14:21.612
You can borrow my bicycle if you like?

14:22.196 --> 14:25.407
Thank you, David, but I don't think
that's gonna get me there quick enough.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.451
You could take the basket off.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.494
Right. Why does that make it faster?

14:29.494 --> 14:32.080
I don't know.
I've never taken the basket off before.

14:33.457 --> 14:35.459
- I'm gonna go back in--
- No. Come on, mate. Right.

14:35.459 --> 14:36.376
Breathe.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.755
You can do this, okay, Danny? Yeah?

14:40.589 --> 14:43.008
You can do this.

14:46.386 --> 14:47.679
Also, your cab's here.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.597
It's here?

14:50.224 --> 14:52.059
- It's here.
- It's here.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.531
I hope he's gonna be okay.

15:06.240 --> 15:08.659
He likes me more than he likes you.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.639
Please, brain, let me do this one thing.

15:47.823 --> 15:48.949
That's the same reason...

16:02.880 --> 16:05.507
<i>Well, I better get to bed,
or I'll never be up in the morning.</i>

16:05.507 --> 16:07.426
<i>What time do you finish your shift again?</i>

16:07.426 --> 16:09.386
- I told you. Midday.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

16:09.386 --> 16:11.513
<i>Did you remember
to put on your support socks?</i>

16:11.513 --> 16:13.307
- Yep.
- <i>You know how you ache if you don't.</i>

16:13.307 --> 16:15.225
- Yep.
- <i>Have you got your flask?</i>

16:15.225 --> 16:16.310
I got the flask.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.770
<i>Oh, good.
I made you some pea and ham soup.</i>

16:20.105 --> 16:22.149
- Bermondsey?
- Yeah. That's me.

16:23.901 --> 16:24.902
In there?

16:25.652 --> 16:26.987
Unless you wanna drive.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.411
<i>Sorry,
but I've thrown out your green pants.</i>

16:34.411 --> 16:36.413
- <i>The elastic has finally gone in them.</i>
- Right.

16:36.413 --> 16:38.290
<i>Well, I'm off to bed.</i>

16:38.290 --> 16:40.501
<i>See you around lunchtime. Enjoy the soup.</i>

16:40.501 --> 16:41.627
- <i>Night then.</i>
- Night.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.796
Sorry about that.

16:45.464 --> 16:46.548
It's the wife.

16:47.424 --> 16:49.051
Made me pea and ham soup.

16:50.886 --> 16:52.387
You like pea and ham soup?

16:53.263 --> 16:54.515
I don't. Hate it.

16:55.474 --> 17:00.437
But I'm 17 years in now,
so it's pea and ham soup till I'm dead.

17:00.437 --> 17:03.524
Sorry, do you mi-- Is it okay
if I let-- Wind the window down?

17:03.524 --> 17:04.942
Free country.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.220
Sorry, how far do we have left?

17:35.264 --> 17:37.140
Eight minutes, give or take.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.184
Okay, thank you.

17:41.645 --> 17:42.521
Hello?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.773
Danny, it's all gone quite wrong.

17:44.773 --> 17:46.400
Don't worry. We'll fix it.

17:46.400 --> 17:51.530
I'm really high, Danny,
and I'm just off my tits.

17:51.530 --> 17:54.491
Listen, Lisa, it'll be fine. It'll all
be fine. It's one big misunderstanding.

17:54.491 --> 17:56.410
I'm just kind of finding it hard
to breathe.

17:56.410 --> 17:58.537
Yeah, well-- I know how you feel.

17:58.537 --> 18:00.497
I just don't really know what to do.

18:00.497 --> 18:03.375
Well, I'll be there in a minute.
Whatever it is, we will figure it out.

18:03.375 --> 18:05.502
- <i>I promise.</i>
- You know, and I just think, you know,

18:05.502 --> 18:07.129
Veggie's gonna propose

18:07.129 --> 18:08.255
and I'm gonna say yes.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.507
Sorry. I didn't hear that.
Say that again. Veggie's what?

18:10.507 --> 18:12.467
Excuse me, miss, we need to talk to you.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.636
- Could you wrap that up?
- All right. I've gotta go.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.555
- No. I can't, Danny.
- <i>Don't go. I'm coming to get--</i>

18:16.555 --> 18:18.432
No. Wait, Lisa. I'm coming to get y--

18:28.275 --> 18:29.776
- That your girlfriend, is it?
- What?

18:32.571 --> 18:33.697
No. Sorry, no.

18:33.697 --> 18:35.240
No, we're just-- we're mates.

18:36.366 --> 18:38.076
Yeah, if you say so.

18:40.204 --> 18:41.788
- Yeah?
- <i>Tony, it's Bill.</i>

18:41.788 --> 18:43.498
- <i>You working?</i>
- Yeah.

18:44.291 --> 18:45.667
<i>You near your house?</i>

18:45.667 --> 18:46.793
Yeah, not too far.

18:46.793 --> 18:49.213
<i>Right. Listen up, 'cause there's
something I need to talk to you about.</i>

18:49.213 --> 18:50.547
Hold on. Let me just--

18:53.050 --> 18:54.176
What's going on?

18:57.721 --> 18:59.056
Right.

19:01.850 --> 19:03.143
Is he, now?

19:07.648 --> 19:08.649
Did she?

19:11.485 --> 19:12.486
Right.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.331
Excuse me. What's happening?

19:25.082 --> 19:26.124
Detour.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.089
Yeah-- What's happening?

19:48.939 --> 19:50.190
Two ticks.

19:57.155 --> 19:59.533
Elaine? Elaine? Where is he?

19:59.533 --> 20:01.869
I know he's here. I can smell his musk.

20:01.869 --> 20:04.746
- What the...
- ...in my bed, using my bed pillow.

20:04.746 --> 20:05.831
What was that?

20:05.831 --> 20:07.708
- Nothing.
- All right. Come out. Face me.

20:07.708 --> 20:09.543
No. Tony, wait!

20:09.543 --> 20:11.461
- Where is he?
- Probably a dog.

20:12.504 --> 20:13.755
Jesus Christ.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.799
Don't go out there.

20:15.799 --> 20:16.884
Oi!

20:18.010 --> 20:19.011
Oi!

20:20.637 --> 20:23.348
Get your ass off that seat.
I've just had this thing cleaned.

20:23.849 --> 20:24.850
Right!

20:25.934 --> 20:27.936
What you doing?

20:28.437 --> 20:33.650
I'm gonna kill you.
Oi! Stop it! Get out! Oi!

20:41.867 --> 20:43.660
You can drop me off anywhere
at the top of this road.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.995
That should be fine.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.808
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Danny.</i>

21:06.808 --> 21:10.270
- Are you okay? Where are you? I'm here.
- <i>Well, no, I'm at home.</i>

21:10.270 --> 21:11.772
- You're where?
- <i>I'm at home.</i>

21:11.772 --> 21:15.442
They let me off with a cannabis warning.
I just wanted to let you know.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.778
- You're home?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

21:20.531 --> 21:21.532
Right.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.743
That's great. Well done.

21:27.037 --> 21:28.163
Is everything okay?

21:28.163 --> 21:29.331
Yeah.

21:29.331 --> 21:31.625
I'm just here outside a launderette

21:31.625 --> 21:34.002
called Launderette,
wondering where the hell you are.

21:34.878 --> 21:37.172
<i>But look, I'm happy everything
worked out for you.</i>

21:37.172 --> 21:39.174
What? Danny, you came to get me?

21:39.174 --> 21:41.301
Sorry, love, can I have my phone back?

21:42.803 --> 21:45.722
Oh, Danny, I'm really sorry.
I'm gonna have to go,

21:45.722 --> 21:47.933
- <i>but I'm gonna call you back immediately.</i>
- Listen, night, Leese.

21:47.933 --> 21:49.101
<i>I--</i>

21:49.643 --> 21:50.978
Hello?

21:54.731 --> 21:56.817
- Sorry. Thank you.
- Thank you.

21:56.817 --> 21:58.485
- Are you okay? Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm good.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.737
I'm really good.
Thank you so much. Thanks.

22:09.288 --> 22:12.457
- <i>You're not gonna go?</i>
- <i>Yeah. No, I'm really not gonna go.</i>

22:12.457 --> 22:14.418
Go on. It'll be fun.

22:14.418 --> 22:16.253
Gemma will miss you
if you're not there for hen night.

22:16.253 --> 22:17.880
Yeah, but Gemma won't remember.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.382
Plus, it's Gemma,
so there will definitely be a stripper

22:20.382 --> 22:22.217
and I'm just really
not up for that tonight.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.595
Okay.

22:24.595 --> 22:27.598
Note to self, don't let anyone
hire a stripper for your hen night.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.769
What do you mean my hen night?
What hen night?

22:32.769 --> 22:35.439
Just, you know, like, when you have one.

22:38.483 --> 22:40.235
- Leese?
- You know what? Maybe I will go.

22:40.235 --> 22:41.403
Thanks, Vedge.

22:43.238 --> 22:44.448
No problem.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.867
Oh, no.

22:49.620 --> 22:50.829
Okay.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.464
Oh, no.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.761
Sorry.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.265
Lisa? What's going on?

23:52.182 --> 23:54.017
You know, and I just think, you know,

23:54.017 --> 23:57.229
Veggie's gonna propose
and I'm gonna say yes.

24:30.429 --> 24:31.430
Danny?

24:36.059 --> 24:37.060
Danny.

24:40.898 --> 24:43.025
Hey, Amy.

24:44.401 --> 24:45.527
Hi.
