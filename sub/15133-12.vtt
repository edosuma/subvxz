WEBVTT

00:02.985 --> 00:04.307
Previously on Smash...

00:06.247 --> 00:07.380
Lights!

00:07.415 --> 00:08.481
That's my favorite song.

00:08.516 --> 00:09.549
Don't give it to Ana.

00:09.583 --> 00:10.650
I just did.

00:10.685 --> 00:11.685
I'm not the star anymore,
am I?

00:11.719 --> 00:12.953
It's not my fault.

00:12.987 --> 00:15.122
<i>"Hit list</i> opens our eyes
to the present

00:15.156 --> 00:17.190
and the inevitable future."

00:17.224 --> 00:18.191
You said you didn't need me.

00:18.225 --> 00:19.792
So you ran off
to help Derek?

00:19.827 --> 00:21.707
When I finally said
I wouldn't sleep with you,

00:21.728 --> 00:24.197
I mysteriously
lost out on the job.

00:24.231 --> 00:25.764
It's 'cause of you.

00:25.799 --> 00:27.433
- You got us here.
- How do you know Jimmy?

00:27.467 --> 00:29.335
Old friends.

00:29.369 --> 00:33.471
Stand by, lights and sound.
60 seconds.

00:33.484 --> 00:37.057
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

00:40.813 --> 00:42.214
Can you believe
the next time we do this,

00:42.248 --> 00:44.249
it'll be opening night?

00:44.283 --> 00:45.523
You were on fire
tonight, Ivy.

00:45.551 --> 00:47.652
Mwah!

00:47.686 --> 00:49.887
I hope you saved something
for tomorrow night.

00:49.921 --> 00:51.155
Don't worry.

00:51.189 --> 00:53.490
For the first time, I actually
feel kind of confident.

00:53.524 --> 00:54.925
So I was just reading online...

00:54.960 --> 00:56.827
- Bup, bup, bup, bup.
- What is it now?

00:56.862 --> 00:59.429
She's in a self-imposed
media blackout until opening.

00:59.464 --> 01:00.697
Seriously?

01:00.732 --> 01:02.566
I just want to focus
on giving

01:02.600 --> 01:04.233
the best performance I can.

01:04.268 --> 01:06.035
All you have to do is make it
till tomorrow night.

01:06.070 --> 01:08.504
And I will.

01:08.538 --> 01:10.539
- <i>Gulliver's travels.</i>
<i>- </i> Too big.

01:12.809 --> 01:14.911
- <i>Lord of the class</i>
- Too bleak.

01:14.945 --> 01:16.306
Are you rejecting
all of my pitches

01:16.313 --> 01:17.747
'cause you're still mad
about that article?

01:17.781 --> 01:20.749
I can't apologize more
than I already have.

01:20.783 --> 01:22.050
You sure?

01:22.085 --> 01:23.685
Okay.

01:23.719 --> 01:25.587
Different pitch.

01:25.621 --> 01:29.024
I have said this before,
but I will say it again.

01:29.058 --> 01:32.060
A musical can be built
around the poetry of Ezra Pound.

01:34.163 --> 01:35.830
Ok, if you don't like
any of my ideas,

01:35.865 --> 01:38.032
then you'll pitch me yours
when we get home.

01:38.047 --> 01:39.347
I can't.

01:39.442 --> 01:41.882
I'm having drinks later with,
Geoff Preston. Want to come?

01:43.002 --> 01:44.459
Drinks with the producer?
No thanks.

01:46.170 --> 01:49.313
What about a very hungry
****?

01:49.378 --> 01:51.240
You said that
you always wanted

01:51.266 --> 01:53.037
to do something with
***, with puppets.

01:53.107 --> 01:55.642
How about we do this
tomorrow, after we open,

01:55.677 --> 01:58.679
and <i>the New York Times</i>
loves us or hates us?

02:02.984 --> 02:04.818
Yeah, I tried to reach
<i>the Times</i> this morning

02:04.852 --> 02:06.386
to get a heads-up
on the review.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.687
They wouldn't give me
an inkling.

02:08.722 --> 02:11.256
Has Richard said anything?

02:11.291 --> 02:14.794
To tell you the truth, Richard
and I aren't doing so great.

02:14.828 --> 02:15.861
The article.

02:15.896 --> 02:17.529
Was a total betrayal.

02:17.564 --> 02:19.999
Yeah, but it was press.

02:20.033 --> 02:23.002
<i>Bombshell</i> got mentioned
almost as much as <i>Hit list</i> did.

02:23.036 --> 02:24.069
That's a plus in my book.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.905
I pay you
to say those things.

02:26.939 --> 02:28.606
But to tell you the truth...

02:28.640 --> 02:31.810
The last person I want to take
to the opening is Richard.

02:31.844 --> 02:34.512
I was almost thinking
of un-inviting him.

02:34.546 --> 02:35.814
Are you crazy?

02:35.848 --> 02:39.084
The last thing we need
is a vindictive journalist.

02:39.118 --> 02:40.851
He's an editor,
not a critic.

02:40.885 --> 02:43.987
Plus, the review's
already been filed.

02:44.022 --> 02:45.355
Yeah, but not printed.

02:45.389 --> 02:46.857
We can't take any chances.

02:46.891 --> 02:48.859
You're gonna text him
and tell him

02:48.893 --> 02:50.160
that you can't wait
to see him

02:50.195 --> 02:54.264
and that you're not wearing
any underwear.

02:54.298 --> 02:56.532
People, listen up!

02:56.566 --> 02:58.367
So, as of ten minutes ago,

02:58.401 --> 03:01.237
we are sold out
for the rest of the run.

03:02.609 --> 03:04.577
If you have yet
to set aside tickets

03:04.611 --> 03:06.745
for your nearest and dearest,
please see me immediately after

03:06.780 --> 03:07.780
about house seats.

03:07.781 --> 03:08.948
They are few
and far between.

03:08.982 --> 03:11.517
Also, tomorrow night,
Eileen Rand

03:11.552 --> 03:13.918
has invited us all
to attend the opening

03:13.953 --> 03:15.353
of <i>Bombshell.</i>

03:15.388 --> 03:16.788
It is incredibly gracious
of her,

03:16.822 --> 03:20.992
so let's meet at the Lily Hayes
at 6:30 for 7:00 curtain.

03:21.026 --> 03:23.028
Ana.

03:25.000 --> 03:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:32.170 --> 03:33.537
Hey.

03:33.572 --> 03:34.972
Hey, Karen!

03:35.006 --> 03:36.940
Wait up.

03:36.975 --> 03:39.210
Hey, so since we have to go
to this opening tomorrow,

03:39.244 --> 03:41.378
why don't we just go
together?

03:41.413 --> 03:43.180
Actually, I don't think
I'm going.

03:43.215 --> 03:45.081
Well, Scott just said that
the whole cast has to be there.

03:45.116 --> 03:47.350
Yeah, well, the whole cast
wasn't the lead in the show,

03:47.384 --> 03:48.851
so Scott will understand.

03:48.885 --> 03:50.620
You know what?
I don't...

03:50.654 --> 03:51.821
I don't want to talk
about this with you.

03:51.855 --> 03:52.955
Hey.

03:52.990 --> 03:54.111
You're barely talking
to Ana.

03:54.125 --> 03:55.325
Derek's barely talking
to you.

03:55.359 --> 03:57.127
Just because things
are weird between us

03:57.161 --> 03:58.894
doesn't mean
that you can't talk to me.

04:00.497 --> 04:02.897
I just feel like it would be
a really hard night.

04:02.932 --> 04:04.566
You regret
leaving <i>Bombshell?</i>

04:04.601 --> 04:06.468
No regrets.

04:06.503 --> 04:08.403
But it's like going
to your ex's wedding.

04:08.438 --> 04:10.239
It's not that you want
to get back together,

04:10.273 --> 04:12.107
but you don't exactly want
to see them marry

04:12.142 --> 04:13.275
someone else either.

04:13.309 --> 04:14.610
Well, you know what
the best thing to bring

04:14.644 --> 04:16.377
to an ex's wedding is,
right?

04:16.411 --> 04:18.045
A date.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.481
Nice try.

04:20.516 --> 04:21.915
Yeah.

04:21.950 --> 04:24.285
So, I mean,
all I'm saying is,

04:24.319 --> 04:27.688
tomorrow night,
you've got me in your corner...

04:27.722 --> 04:31.425
If you still want me.

04:35.095 --> 04:37.330
Well, I liked it.

04:37.365 --> 04:38.598
I didn't love it.

04:38.633 --> 04:41.501
You never love anything.

04:41.536 --> 04:42.669
The music was great.

04:42.703 --> 04:44.638
It's not the music.
It's her.

04:44.672 --> 04:46.506
Did you...
Did you read the playbill?

04:46.541 --> 04:48.542
She's been knocking
around the ensemble for years.

04:48.576 --> 04:50.943
Shall we get a cab?

04:50.978 --> 04:53.512
Taxi!

05:03.523 --> 05:04.790
Hey.

05:04.824 --> 05:05.824
Adam, right?

05:05.825 --> 05:07.325
You came?

05:07.359 --> 05:09.227
I did.
You were great.

05:09.261 --> 05:11.830
Well, thank you.

05:11.864 --> 05:13.999
A few of us are going
to a bar across the street.

05:14.033 --> 05:15.633
You wanna come?

05:15.668 --> 05:17.936
I would love to,
but I don't think Jimmy

05:17.970 --> 05:20.271
would like that very much.

05:20.306 --> 05:22.372
Well, Jimmy's not
gonna be there.

05:22.407 --> 05:25.275
- I should really go.
- Wait.

05:25.310 --> 05:27.411
What's going on?

05:27.445 --> 05:28.679
Well, I don't think Jimmy
wants anybody

05:28.714 --> 05:31.015
to know this, but...

05:31.049 --> 05:33.818
He's my brother.

05:33.852 --> 05:37.653
How's life
as a big, fancy producer?

05:37.688 --> 05:39.422
At the moment, not great.

05:39.456 --> 05:41.758
I might have to cancel
my revival next season.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.226
<i>City of angels?</i>

05:43.260 --> 05:45.661
No! You can't!
I've been...

05:45.696 --> 05:47.197
I've been looking forward
to seeing that all year.

05:47.231 --> 05:48.431
Sorry to disappoint.

05:48.465 --> 05:51.134
My director just got
the next Bond movie

05:51.168 --> 05:52.435
and jumped ship.

05:52.469 --> 05:55.037
We were supposed to start
rehearsals in six weeks.

05:55.071 --> 05:57.239
So find someone else.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.506
But whoever you get,

05:58.541 --> 06:00.175
please promise me
they'll nail the noir.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.177
Doesn't have to be
purely comic.

06:02.212 --> 06:05.413
It can be dark
and tragic too.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.983
What?
I'm serious.

06:09.017 --> 06:11.986
So that would be
your take?

06:13.688 --> 06:18.425
What if you
were my new director?

06:18.460 --> 06:19.627
You serious?

06:19.661 --> 06:21.129
Have you got something else
lined up?

06:21.163 --> 06:26.532
Are you and Julia launching
straight into another project?

06:26.567 --> 06:28.201
- No.
- Good.

06:28.236 --> 06:31.671
Because directing
a show like this, like <i>Angels,</i>

06:31.705 --> 06:35.341
is a full-time job.

06:38.179 --> 06:39.545
I-I'd be honored.

06:39.580 --> 06:41.714
Great.
I'll talk to my partners.

06:41.749 --> 06:44.384
If the reviews
are as good as I expect,

06:44.418 --> 06:47.219
you'll be back
on Broadway next season.

06:51.325 --> 06:52.325
Hit it.

06:57.796 --> 06:59.973
"Have the grace of her predecessor."

07:00.858 --> 07:03.358
"A career chorus girl."

07:03.392 --> 07:06.561
"Can she even dance?"

07:06.595 --> 07:08.130
Why are you reading
message boards?

07:08.164 --> 07:09.564
I'm preparing myself.

07:09.598 --> 07:11.499
I need to know what people are
gonna be saying about me.

07:11.533 --> 07:15.137
No, you don't.

07:15.171 --> 07:17.172
Oy.

07:17.206 --> 07:20.241
Your job
is to put yourself out there

07:20.275 --> 07:23.443
and let go.

07:23.478 --> 07:25.246
Nothing kills the work
quicker than worrying

07:25.280 --> 07:27.181
about what other people think.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.682
Are you seriously
going to tell me

07:28.716 --> 07:30.284
that you're not going
to compare

07:30.318 --> 07:32.019
Tom's work to yours tonight?

07:32.053 --> 07:34.053
Not at all.

07:34.088 --> 07:35.655
You don't have to lie
to me.

07:35.689 --> 07:38.825
I know you,
and I still like you.

07:41.862 --> 07:45.498
I have let <i>Bombshell</i> go.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.466
Just not its leading lady.

07:47.501 --> 07:49.135
Nice try,

07:49.170 --> 07:52.704
but I'm not going to be
wearing myself out today.

07:52.738 --> 07:55.340
Later tonight,
after the party?

07:55.374 --> 07:57.042
Yeah, what's...

07:57.076 --> 07:58.243
What's our story?

07:58.278 --> 08:00.378
What are we saying?
Are we together?

08:00.413 --> 08:03.648
I hadn't really thought
about that.

08:03.683 --> 08:06.684
Yeah, well, you know,
it's fine if you don't want to.

08:09.154 --> 08:10.688
Do you want to?

08:13.558 --> 08:14.658
You know what?

08:14.693 --> 08:16.894
Let's just play it
by ear.

08:16.929 --> 08:21.898
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:21.933 --> 08:25.268
I'm excited about tonight.

08:25.303 --> 08:27.263
I knew as you got older,
you'd learn to appreciate

08:27.271 --> 08:28.305
the theater more.

08:28.339 --> 08:29.505
Is it true Ivy gets naked?

08:30.842 --> 08:33.443
Next week, I'm gonna take you
to see <i>Hit list.</i>

08:33.477 --> 08:34.644
It's more up your alley.

08:34.678 --> 08:36.446
But don't tell Tom
I said that.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.679
He's still a little pissed
at me.

08:37.715 --> 08:39.081
Is that why
you're moving out?

08:39.115 --> 08:41.250
I'm moving out
because it's time.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.385
I can't sleep
on a couch forever.

08:43.419 --> 08:45.387
Remember when we worked
on my presentation

08:45.421 --> 08:46.688
for this freshman year?

08:46.723 --> 08:47.756
Got an "A" minus.

08:47.790 --> 08:48.991
Is that <i>Gatsby?</i>

08:51.461 --> 08:52.728
The night Tom and I met,

08:52.762 --> 08:54.028
this is all
we talked about.

08:54.063 --> 08:55.830
We were both obsessed.

08:55.865 --> 08:58.266
We couldn't believe it hadn't
been turned into a musical.

08:58.267 --> 09:00.168
The big society
party scenes,

09:00.202 --> 09:02.136
the unrequited love story,

09:02.171 --> 09:04.239
the narrator...
It's perfect.

09:04.273 --> 09:05.506
But you never did it.

09:05.540 --> 09:08.109
No, we tried to do it
a bunch of times back then,

09:08.143 --> 09:10.477
but the rights
were never available.

09:10.511 --> 09:12.946
When was the last time
you checked?

09:17.451 --> 09:19.253
That's the fourth shirt
you've tried on.

09:19.287 --> 09:21.255
Yeah, yeah,
it's a Broadway opening.

09:21.289 --> 09:22.856
I don't want to look
like a jerk.

09:22.891 --> 09:26.158
Since when do you care
how you look?

09:26.193 --> 09:29.395
I might talk
to Karen tonight.

09:29.429 --> 09:31.197
About what?

09:31.231 --> 09:33.199
About...

09:33.233 --> 09:35.167
Everything.

09:35.202 --> 09:38.871
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

09:38.906 --> 09:40.539
You know everything about me.
You still like me.

09:40.573 --> 09:43.574
That's different.

09:43.609 --> 09:45.743
Karen is not like me.

09:45.778 --> 09:49.080
This could push her away
for good.

09:53.319 --> 09:56.321
I was wondering when
you were gonna come home.

09:58.623 --> 10:00.991
Can we talk?

10:01.026 --> 10:03.360
So we're doing that again?

10:03.395 --> 10:05.429
No, this is important.

10:05.463 --> 10:07.431
Did you see that guy
at the stage door last night?

10:07.465 --> 10:08.799
Blond and cute?

10:08.833 --> 10:10.567
I get it.

10:10.601 --> 10:12.436
You met some guy,
and now you want to talk to me?

10:12.470 --> 10:14.670
That's Jimmy's brother.

10:14.704 --> 10:16.272
I thought Jimmy
was an only child.

10:16.307 --> 10:18.574
Well, if he told you that,
then he lied.

10:18.608 --> 10:19.675
And not just about that.

10:19.709 --> 10:21.177
About a lot of other things.

10:21.211 --> 10:22.711
You have no idea
who Jimmy is.

10:22.746 --> 10:26.349
Okay, Ana, can we please
not do this now?

10:26.383 --> 10:27.663
Look, nothing Jimmy
has ever said

10:27.684 --> 10:29.952
has checked out,
and you know that.

10:29.986 --> 10:31.486
And when Adam filled in
the blanks, it did.

10:31.520 --> 10:33.922
And let me tell you,
it is not pretty.

10:33.957 --> 10:35.023
Look, you don't have
to believe me.

10:35.058 --> 10:40.162
Just hear me out
and decide for yourself.

10:40.196 --> 10:42.397
F.Y.I.,
we're in a limo right now,

10:42.432 --> 10:45.600
about to attend an opening
on the great white way.

10:45.634 --> 10:47.634
Could it get any better?

10:47.669 --> 10:49.070
Wait!

10:49.104 --> 10:52.306
Yes, it could.
We wrote the show.

10:57.145 --> 11:01.515
I got you something.

11:01.549 --> 11:05.251
Remember our very first
conversation at that party?

11:05.286 --> 11:07.887
Remember it?
That's when we fell in love.

11:07.921 --> 11:10.957
Open it.

11:20.333 --> 11:25.504
Ahrens and Flaherty's
option lapsed.

11:25.538 --> 11:27.106
Our lawyer is working
on getting us the rights

11:27.140 --> 11:29.608
as we speak.

11:29.642 --> 11:31.810
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

11:31.844 --> 11:34.078
It's the only project for us.
I knew you'd agree.

11:34.113 --> 11:36.014
I already told Agnes
that we'll make the announcement

11:36.048 --> 11:37.482
at the party.

11:45.924 --> 11:49.693
Hi, how are you?
Hi, Meg.

11:49.728 --> 11:50.693
Marc!

11:50.728 --> 11:52.062
- Hi.
- Hi.

11:52.096 --> 11:53.763
Mwah, mwah.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.166
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hi, Scott.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.035
I'm so glad
you could make it.

11:58.069 --> 11:59.336
We're very excited, Eileen.

11:59.370 --> 12:01.704
Almost as excited as you must be
with Richard here.

12:03.207 --> 12:04.841
Thanks for the tip.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.642
We got the last two tickets
to <i>Hit list.</i>

12:08.512 --> 12:10.413
Well, you're welcome.

12:10.447 --> 12:12.415
Let's go.

12:12.449 --> 12:14.683
- Have fun.
- Break a leg.

12:14.717 --> 12:15.717
I'm,
I'm gonna go see

12:15.752 --> 12:18.187
the actors backstage,
wish them luck.

12:18.221 --> 12:19.321
I'll go with you.

12:19.356 --> 12:22.357
No, that's not necessary.

12:22.391 --> 12:23.591
We haven't seen
each other in days.

12:23.625 --> 12:25.693
You didn't kiss me hello.

12:25.727 --> 12:27.028
What is going on?

12:27.063 --> 12:28.663
Let's just get
through tonight, okay?

12:28.697 --> 12:30.698
And then we can talk
about everything tomorrow.

12:30.732 --> 12:31.832
And I'll stand around
like a prop

12:31.867 --> 12:34.035
while you pretend
to enjoy yourself.

12:34.070 --> 12:35.437
I've been doing that
for weeks.

12:35.471 --> 12:37.872
What's one more night?

12:37.906 --> 12:39.973
This is all
about a newspaper article?

12:40.007 --> 12:43.110
You made a choice when you
wrote that article, Richard.

12:43.144 --> 12:45.245
And now I'm making mine.

12:48.149 --> 12:49.783
Have a wonderful
opening, Eileen.

12:49.817 --> 12:54.087
I will...
Now.

12:57.724 --> 12:59.125
I need to talk to you.

12:59.159 --> 13:01.094
Yeah, I need
to talk to you too.

13:01.128 --> 13:02.895
Yeah, I know I haven't been
very honest with you.

13:02.929 --> 13:05.531
It's... it's just...
It's hard for me to admit

13:05.566 --> 13:06.806
the things I've done
in my life.

13:06.833 --> 13:08.234
You have until the curtain
goes up to tell me

13:08.268 --> 13:09.402
about your brother,
or I'm gone.

13:09.436 --> 13:10.668
What... how do you...

13:10.703 --> 13:13.105
- How do you know about Adam?
- Through Ana.

13:13.139 --> 13:14.339
And I'm warning you,
he's already done

13:14.373 --> 13:17.041
a lot of talking,
but I want to hear it from you.

13:17.076 --> 13:18.076
No more lies.

13:18.077 --> 13:19.244
What, let me guess.

13:19.278 --> 13:20.945
He's made me out to be
some bad guy.

13:20.980 --> 13:25.317
Well, was he lying?

13:26.818 --> 13:28.152
Fine. Forget it.

13:28.186 --> 13:31.088
You want the story?

13:31.123 --> 13:34.725
Okay, well, my dad beat the crap
out of me and my mom.

13:34.759 --> 13:35.759
After she died,

13:35.793 --> 13:37.661
me and Adam
were on the streets.

13:37.695 --> 13:38.829
I dealt drugs, okay?

13:38.863 --> 13:40.131
I used them.

13:40.165 --> 13:43.633
I watched people O.D.,
and I didn't call 911.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.001
When you're living life
like that,

13:45.035 --> 13:49.739
you do a lot of things
that you are not proud of.

13:49.773 --> 13:52.675
Adam got me into that life.

13:52.709 --> 13:55.678
Kyle saved me.

13:55.712 --> 13:58.713
He is my real brother.

13:58.748 --> 14:02.184
So when I tell you that...

14:02.218 --> 14:03.885
Adam is nobody to me,

14:03.919 --> 14:06.721
it's because he is
nobody to me.

14:10.226 --> 14:13.128
Please just... I...

14:13.163 --> 14:15.329
Don't cut me out of your life
because of who I used to be.

14:15.364 --> 14:18.366
I have changed.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.535
I wasn't a good person,
but ever since I met you,

14:20.569 --> 14:23.571
it's all I want to be.

14:25.607 --> 14:28.609
Let's go take our seats.

14:31.679 --> 14:34.247
Sleep on <i>Gatsby?</i>
Why?

14:34.282 --> 14:36.049
We always rush
into everything.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.885
We announced our next project
<i>Heaven on Earth's</i> opening.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.488
Our Vegas musical?
Never happened.

14:41.522 --> 14:44.891
Maybe announcing on opening
is a jinx.

14:44.925 --> 14:47.059
Can... can we let it go?

14:47.093 --> 14:49.628
Please?

14:49.663 --> 14:53.098
Eileen.
Where's Richard?

14:53.132 --> 14:54.500
We broke up.

14:54.534 --> 14:57.203
It's very sad, and I don't want
to talk about it.

14:57.237 --> 14:59.971
Are you out of your
tiny mind?

15:00.006 --> 15:01.240
Let's not bicker.

15:01.274 --> 15:02.674
We've got a long night
ahead of us.

15:02.708 --> 15:05.443
You need to get on your knees
and pray

15:05.477 --> 15:08.479
that there aren't
any consequences.

15:13.552 --> 15:18.255
Thank you.

15:18.289 --> 15:20.224
Mom?

15:20.258 --> 15:21.491
What? What?
What's wrong?

15:21.526 --> 15:23.860
You've never lied
to me before.

15:23.894 --> 15:26.062
Even when I desperately
wanted you to.

15:26.097 --> 15:28.898
But I need you
to tell me the truth now,

15:28.933 --> 15:31.134
before the reviews.

15:31.168 --> 15:32.836
Am I gonna make it?

15:32.870 --> 15:34.770
- Ivy...
- I know you know.

15:34.804 --> 15:37.005
Look how far you've come
since just last year.

15:37.040 --> 15:39.775
I don't feel like
I've gotten anywhere.

15:39.809 --> 15:41.244
I feel like I'm
the same old Ivy,

15:41.278 --> 15:43.446
the girl in the back
of the chorus.

15:43.480 --> 15:45.481
I feel like that every time
I set foot on stage.

15:45.515 --> 15:48.217
All it takes to make it
in this business

15:48.252 --> 15:52.320
is one role,
if it's right for you.

15:52.355 --> 15:53.888
You fought like hell,

15:53.922 --> 15:56.090
and you got that role.

15:56.125 --> 15:59.394
You are Marilyn Monroe
on Broadway.

15:59.428 --> 16:03.131
Now get out there
and show everyone

16:03.165 --> 16:07.268
what all those years
in the chorus taught you.

Congratulations, Julia.

20:35.126 --> 20:36.626
Really, this is
your best work ever.

20:36.660 --> 20:39.462
Thank you.

20:39.497 --> 20:41.030
Tom's a great director.

20:41.064 --> 20:45.268
I cannot wait to see what he's
gonna do with <i>City of angels.</i>

20:45.302 --> 20:46.568
What?

20:46.603 --> 20:49.304
Yeah, Eileen told me
that's his next project.

21:05.086 --> 21:07.388
Bravo!

21:28.609 --> 21:30.677
I'm not saying it was better
than my version,

21:30.711 --> 21:33.713
but,
still a pretty good show.

21:33.747 --> 21:35.381
Let me guess.

21:35.415 --> 21:37.249
The choreography saved it.

21:39.452 --> 21:41.153
Congratulations, brother.

21:41.188 --> 21:43.722
It's the best show
on Broadway.

21:43.756 --> 21:46.458
For now.

21:46.493 --> 21:48.194
What do you mean?

21:48.228 --> 21:49.528
Come on.

21:49.563 --> 21:51.262
You haven't filled
your next slot

21:51.297 --> 21:52.630
'cause you're not done
with <i>Hit list,</i>

21:52.665 --> 21:54.399
and neither am I.

21:54.433 --> 21:56.267
And the Broadway season's
not over.

21:56.302 --> 21:57.535
There's still time.

21:58.804 --> 22:01.272
You want to move <i>Hit list</i>
to Broadway.

22:01.307 --> 22:03.107
We haven't even opened
downtown yet.

22:03.141 --> 22:04.242
So what?

22:04.276 --> 22:08.545
Good shows transfer fast.
You know that.

22:08.580 --> 22:10.547
That would put you in direct
competition with <i>Bombshell.</i>

22:10.582 --> 22:12.416
Keep up, Scott.

22:14.952 --> 22:16.820
Jon, I want <i>Post</i>
and <i>Daily News</i> quotes

22:16.854 --> 22:19.489
in time
for local morning radio.

22:19.524 --> 22:21.925
Donna, see if we can make
rush hour on the west coast.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.058
You're a machine.

22:23.093 --> 22:24.560
As soon as these
reviews are in,

22:24.595 --> 22:26.895
I want to start pulling potential
quotes for the campaign.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.297
I'm hearing good things

22:28.332 --> 22:30.333
about <i>The Journal</i>
and <i>USA Today.</i>

22:30.367 --> 22:32.668
<i>Variety</i> is in.

22:32.703 --> 22:35.471
- Here we go.
- Give it to me.

22:40.976 --> 22:43.945
"Finest musical
of the season."

22:43.979 --> 22:46.247
- Woo-hoo!
- Put it on the board!

22:46.281 --> 22:48.015
Give me <i>the New York Times.</i>
What about <i>The Times</i> ?

22:48.050 --> 22:49.683
Nothing yet.
They're always last.

22:50.886 --> 22:52.987
I want your finger
on that "refresh" button

22:53.021 --> 22:54.122
until it comes through.

22:54.156 --> 22:55.991
Yep.

22:57.025 --> 22:58.726
Hey.

22:58.761 --> 23:00.894
This is a lot harder
than I thought.

23:00.928 --> 23:03.663
You know what you're not supposed
to do at an ex's wedding?

23:03.697 --> 23:05.098
Hide in the corner.

23:05.133 --> 23:08.201
What you do is wear
a fantastic dress... check...

23:08.236 --> 23:11.772
And then you laugh and...

23:13.507 --> 23:15.341
No way.

23:15.376 --> 23:19.311
Ana invited him.

23:19.345 --> 23:20.946
Please don't do anything
stupid, okay?

23:20.981 --> 23:22.347
What, like Ana's doing
right now?

23:22.382 --> 23:23.482
Hey.

23:23.516 --> 23:24.817
It took a lot of courage
to tell me

23:24.851 --> 23:27.186
what you told me tonight,
but it was just talk.

23:27.220 --> 23:30.122
So if you've changed...

23:30.157 --> 23:33.291
Prove it.

23:37.562 --> 23:39.530
So it isn't that
you weren't ready to commit

23:39.564 --> 23:41.199
to a project,
it was that you weren't ready

23:41.233 --> 23:42.566
to commit to one with me?

23:42.601 --> 23:44.936
It's not even
a firm offer.

23:44.970 --> 23:46.237
It depends on my reviews.

23:46.272 --> 23:47.552
<i>The Times</i> hasn't even
come out yet.

23:47.572 --> 23:48.739
That's not the point!

23:48.774 --> 23:50.740
I can't believe
you didn't tell me!

23:50.775 --> 23:53.343
Please try to understand
that this isn't about you.

23:53.377 --> 23:56.213
I just want to make a name
for myself as a director.

23:56.247 --> 23:58.081
We could still work
while you do that.

23:58.116 --> 23:59.950
Well, I...

23:59.984 --> 24:02.519
I don't think so.

24:02.553 --> 24:03.987
Okay, so what am I
supposed to do?

24:04.022 --> 24:06.689
Just catch up on my reading
while I wait for you?

24:06.723 --> 24:08.024
How much time
should I set aside?

24:08.058 --> 24:09.458
Six weeks, six months?

24:09.492 --> 24:12.929
Julia, I'm not asking you
to do that.

24:16.233 --> 24:21.069
You don't want me to wait?

24:21.103 --> 24:25.073
This is why I didn't want
to do this tonight.

24:25.107 --> 24:28.109
Okay, I don't understand.

24:30.246 --> 24:35.951
Is this about <i>City of angels</i>
or us?

24:35.985 --> 24:39.253
I love writing with you.

24:39.287 --> 24:42.689
I look forward
to doing it again.

24:42.724 --> 24:47.127
But right now,
what I care about is directing.

24:47.162 --> 24:48.428
And that is it.

25:06.572 --> 25:08.139
Ivy.

25:08.173 --> 25:12.043
What are you doing in here?

25:14.512 --> 25:15.913
<i>The Times</i> review?

25:15.948 --> 25:19.450
The anticipation
is killing me.

25:19.484 --> 25:20.718
And so were my shoes,

25:20.753 --> 25:22.986
so I thought I'd give myself
a minute.

25:23.020 --> 25:24.888
Okay, I'll let you be.

25:24.922 --> 25:25.922
No, no, no.

25:25.957 --> 25:28.158
Stay.

25:28.192 --> 25:30.293
Okay.

25:33.631 --> 25:38.168
I've actually been thinking
about you a lot lately...

25:38.202 --> 25:41.203
Because I can't stop comparing
myself to you.

25:43.706 --> 25:47.309
All of those reviewers
loved you in Boston.

25:47.343 --> 25:49.578
Well, they're gonna love
you too.

25:49.612 --> 25:51.513
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, I do.

25:51.547 --> 25:53.515
Ivy...

25:53.549 --> 25:56.818
No one could've been better
than you tonight.

25:56.852 --> 26:00.554
Not... me.

26:00.589 --> 26:04.292
Not anyone.
Not even Marilyn Monroe herself.

26:06.929 --> 26:09.898
I was so jealous
of you tonight.

26:09.932 --> 26:13.967
I almost left
at intermission.

26:14.002 --> 26:18.338
Why didn't you?

26:18.372 --> 26:21.842
'Cause I-I wanted
to watch you

26:21.876 --> 26:25.512
sing <i>Don't forget me.</i>

26:25.546 --> 26:26.979
Wait.

26:27.014 --> 26:28.147
<i>You</i> were jealous?

26:28.182 --> 26:29.916
Hey, don't rub it in.

26:29.950 --> 26:33.485
The magical
Karen Cartwright?

26:33.520 --> 26:35.788
You do some tiny show
at the Fringe festival,

26:35.823 --> 26:38.057
and suddenly,
it's the can't-miss event

26:38.091 --> 26:40.693
of the season.

26:40.727 --> 26:42.528
It took me eight Broadway shows
to get here.

26:42.562 --> 26:45.030
Yeah, well,
I haven't done one yet, so...

26:45.064 --> 26:47.332
Well, you will.

26:47.366 --> 26:48.533
Just not this season, okay?

26:48.567 --> 26:52.304
Okay, deal.

26:53.572 --> 26:56.607
Is that your brother?

26:56.642 --> 26:57.876
What is he doing here?

26:57.910 --> 27:00.978
Apparently,
he's with Ana now.

27:01.012 --> 27:02.213
Didn't you hear?

27:02.247 --> 27:03.613
No, absolutely not.
What are you gonna do?

27:03.648 --> 27:05.015
Nothing. Nothing.

27:05.050 --> 27:08.853
I promised Karen I'd be
on good behavior.

27:08.887 --> 27:10.888
Well, I didn't.

27:14.259 --> 27:15.491
Ana, you should stay away
from this guy.

27:15.525 --> 27:16.659
He's a creep.

27:16.693 --> 27:19.395
Look,
it's Jimmy's boyfriend.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.529
I'm serious, Ana.

27:20.564 --> 27:21.564
You shouldn't have brought
him here.

27:21.598 --> 27:23.566
Hey, she's an adult.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.235
She can do
what she wants, little man.

27:25.269 --> 27:26.569
You screwed up his life
once already.

27:26.603 --> 27:28.905
He doesn't need you dragging him
down again.

27:28.939 --> 27:32.241
Dude... back off.

27:38.314 --> 27:40.749
Hey, hey, it's time
for you to leave now, Adam.

27:45.421 --> 27:46.721
Okay.

27:46.756 --> 27:47.721
What are you gonna do?

27:47.756 --> 27:50.124
You and your little
girlfriend?

27:50.158 --> 27:52.693
Jimmy, don't!

28:03.804 --> 28:06.172
Of course.
<i>Hit list.</i>

28:11.645 --> 28:16.082
Now get out!

28:16.117 --> 28:18.018
<i>The New York Times</i>
has landed.

28:23.323 --> 28:25.891
What do you want, Jimmy?

28:25.926 --> 28:27.559
I'm sorry.
I mean, I had to.

28:27.593 --> 28:29.962
No.

28:29.996 --> 28:32.097
No, you didn't.

28:32.132 --> 28:33.299
Is that it?
I have to go back in.

28:33.333 --> 28:35.033
Don't leave, all right?

28:35.067 --> 28:36.301
We need to talk.

28:36.335 --> 28:37.936
We already did,
and it didn't matter.

28:37.970 --> 28:39.770
Karen, you don't understand.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.506
No, I do understand.
Actually, I finally do.

28:42.541 --> 28:45.576
Even if you wanted to change,
you're not going to.

28:45.610 --> 28:49.347
You can't.

28:49.381 --> 28:51.681
I have to take care
of myself.

28:51.715 --> 28:54.451
Karen.

28:56.887 --> 28:59.689
You scare me, Jimmy.

28:59.723 --> 29:00.804
You asked
to get to know me.

29:00.825 --> 29:01.959
You just did.

29:01.993 --> 29:04.995
And now you're walking away,
of course!

29:10.700 --> 29:13.169
"Julia Houston
has achieved the impossible.

29:13.203 --> 29:16.904
"She is less book writer here
than playwright,

29:16.939 --> 29:21.409
and a great playwright
at that."

29:21.444 --> 29:22.877
Obviously,
I still hate critics.

29:22.911 --> 29:24.212
Of course.

29:24.246 --> 29:27.282
"Tom Levitt's score
is a triumphant combination

29:27.316 --> 29:30.185
of soulful melodies
and foot-tapping showstoppers."

29:30.219 --> 29:33.153
When his direction
wasn't overblown

29:33.188 --> 29:35.889
or competing with Julia's
complex masterpiece.

29:35.923 --> 29:37.524
Come on,
you know Ben Brantley.

29:37.558 --> 29:40.127
If you're not in <i>US weekly,</i>
he's got it out for you.

29:40.161 --> 29:43.830
Leo, maybe we should see
if there's any dessert left.

29:49.736 --> 29:51.237
Guess I was a bit
too cocky back there

29:51.271 --> 29:53.939
about being
a good director.

29:53.974 --> 29:55.508
All the other critics
loved it.

29:55.542 --> 29:58.811
Not the one
that matters most.

29:58.845 --> 30:00.579
"Houston and Levitt,
whose synchronicity

30:00.614 --> 30:01.881
"previously gave
the impression

30:01.915 --> 30:03.748
"they might be
conjoined twins,

30:03.782 --> 30:07.052
"seem to no longer share
a heart.

30:07.086 --> 30:09.554
"Even in its best moments,
many though there are,

30:09.588 --> 30:10.988
"it is clear the <i>Bombshell</i>
is marching

30:10.990 --> 30:14.359
to two different beats."

30:14.394 --> 30:17.829
It's not true.

30:17.863 --> 30:20.864
No, it isn't.

30:23.835 --> 30:26.737
Let's do <i>Gatsby</i> together.

30:26.771 --> 30:29.773
Announce it right now.
Everyone's still here.

30:35.812 --> 30:37.747
You think you aren't getting
<i>City of angels</i>

30:37.781 --> 30:39.182
because of the review.

30:39.216 --> 30:41.584
This has nothing to do
with <i>city of angels.</i>

30:41.618 --> 30:44.854
You're not being honest
with me... again.

30:44.888 --> 30:46.356
I am.

30:46.390 --> 30:48.158
Let's do <i>Gatsby.</i>

30:48.192 --> 30:49.192
I want to do it.

30:49.226 --> 30:52.061
Only because you lost the
thing you wanted more.

30:54.164 --> 30:56.265
How can we call ourselves
if I'm plan "B"?

31:01.237 --> 31:03.305
Let's just talk about this
at home.

31:03.339 --> 31:05.507
I'm not coming home.

31:11.347 --> 31:14.515
Excuse me.
I'd like to say a few words.

31:14.925 --> 31:17.961
First, I'd like to thank
Julia Houston.

31:20.564 --> 31:23.099
I'd also like to thank
Eileen Rand.

31:26.236 --> 31:32.007
An actor is nothing
without a great director.

31:32.041 --> 31:35.310
Every move I make out on that stage,

31:35.344 --> 31:38.580
I owe to his faith in me,

31:38.615 --> 31:41.950
to his humor,

31:41.985 --> 31:43.718
and to his incredible talent.

31:43.752 --> 31:46.554
He's the one
who gave me this chance.

31:46.588 --> 31:48.990
So would everyone please

31:49.024 --> 31:51.559
raise their glasses

31:51.593 --> 31:55.796
and join me in this toast
to Tom Levitt?

31:55.831 --> 31:57.698
To Tom Levitt!

32:05.806 --> 32:07.641
I also have another person
I'd like to thank.

32:07.675 --> 32:12.078
Karen Cartwright.

32:12.112 --> 32:15.648
I can honestly say
that I wouldn't be here

32:15.682 --> 32:16.815
if it wasn't for you.

32:16.850 --> 32:18.951
So, thank you.

32:18.985 --> 32:21.319
And now that I've put you
on the spot...

32:22.789 --> 32:24.790
I was hoping
you'd come up here

32:24.824 --> 32:26.992
and sing a little something
with me.

32:27.027 --> 32:28.961
Come on.

32:28.995 --> 32:31.363
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

32:31.397 --> 32:32.664
Okay.

32:32.698 --> 32:33.998
Yes! Marc.

32:34.033 --> 32:36.500
Marc, can you come help us?

32:39.538 --> 32:41.105

35:54.769 --> 35:56.090
No wonder it was so hard
to choose

35:56.103 --> 35:57.203
between those two
for Marilyn.

35:57.238 --> 36:00.340
- They're both incredible.
- But very different.

36:00.375 --> 36:05.345
I wonder which one
the Tony voters will prefer.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.247
Let's go to Broadway.

36:07.281 --> 36:10.283
Okay.

36:18.068 --> 36:19.668
Here you go.

36:20.156 --> 36:21.889
- That was fun.
- Thanks..

36:21.923 --> 36:24.792
Hey, I'm sorry
about my friend earlier.

36:24.826 --> 36:26.727
That's all right.

36:28.830 --> 36:30.365
Listen, I know this is
none of my business,

36:30.399 --> 36:34.469
but did you and Derek ever...

36:34.503 --> 36:36.503
Hook up?
No, why?

36:36.538 --> 36:37.704
No reason.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.640
It's just you two
were working together.

36:39.674 --> 36:40.874
I figured
it was bound to happen.

36:40.908 --> 36:42.176
No.

36:42.210 --> 36:43.877
He... he asked me out
a couple weeks ago,

36:43.911 --> 36:46.346
but I was already
seeing someone,

36:46.381 --> 36:47.581
and even if I wasn't...

36:47.615 --> 36:49.583
I'm sorry, did you say
a couple weeks ago?

36:49.617 --> 36:52.552
I don't know.
Maybe a little longer.

36:53.687 --> 36:54.920
- Karen?
- Hey.

36:54.954 --> 36:56.322
- Did you like the show?
- That was great.

36:56.356 --> 36:57.356
Show was really great.

37:05.065 --> 37:09.234
Another opening,
another blow.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.868
You can't predict
what's gonna happen

37:10.903 --> 37:13.771
with you and Tom
in the long run.

37:13.806 --> 37:18.276
But for now,
do what makes you happy.

37:18.311 --> 37:20.111
<i>Gatsby</i> would have
made me happy.

37:20.145 --> 37:21.846
Then do <i>Gatsby.</i>

37:21.880 --> 37:24.415
You read
what <i>The Times</i> said.

37:24.449 --> 37:28.219
You're a playwright.

37:28.253 --> 37:29.820
You really think
I can do that?

37:29.854 --> 37:32.856
Why limit yourself?
Tom's not.

37:35.993 --> 37:39.129
And where do you suggest
I do this play?

37:39.163 --> 37:41.731
I do know a venue.

37:41.765 --> 37:46.469
It's downtown, but there's
a slot open in the fall.

37:47.638 --> 37:48.638
Really?

37:51.508 --> 37:54.210
After I turned my back on you
the last time,

37:54.245 --> 37:55.944
you'd jump back into bed
with me again?

37:55.978 --> 37:57.649
So to speak.

38:00.683 --> 38:03.518
Good night, my angel.

38:03.553 --> 38:07.055
It's time for the older
to go to bed

38:07.089 --> 38:09.891
and for the young
to take over.

38:09.925 --> 38:12.326
Thanks, mom.

38:12.394 --> 38:14.828
For everything.

38:14.863 --> 38:16.664
I'm going to swing by
the news stand

38:16.698 --> 38:18.866
on my way home
and pick up a few copies

38:18.900 --> 38:20.468
of <i>The Times</i>
for my clip book.

38:20.502 --> 38:22.603
You still have that thing?

38:22.638 --> 38:25.839
I started a new one...

38:25.874 --> 38:28.308
For you.

38:28.342 --> 38:33.146
You made me so proud tonight.

38:33.180 --> 38:36.716
I'm so glad I get to work
with you every day.

38:40.220 --> 38:41.755
Good night, baby.

38:41.789 --> 38:44.990
Good night.

38:48.961 --> 38:50.997
Miss Monroe?

38:55.502 --> 38:58.870
You ready to slipping to some more
comfortable?

38:58.905 --> 39:01.606
Actually, I think
I'm good tonight.

39:01.640 --> 39:02.640
Really?

39:02.675 --> 39:06.143
It's been a long day.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.519
- Ok, if you're sure.
- I'm sure.

39:09.548 --> 39:11.949
I'll let you know
if I need you again.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.929
Kyle Bishop.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.331
What are you doing here?

39:27.365 --> 39:29.299
I thought you got
"gicked" ou...

39:29.334 --> 39:30.534
Ha.

39:30.568 --> 39:32.635
I thought you got kicked out.

39:32.669 --> 39:34.670
No, no,
that was Jimmy.

39:34.705 --> 39:37.707
Where's Julia?

39:37.741 --> 39:38.841
She left.

39:40.910 --> 39:46.114
This is so not how I pictured
this night going.

39:46.149 --> 39:47.749
This is a step up
for me.

39:47.783 --> 39:49.250
The last opening night
I went to,

39:49.284 --> 39:51.553
they didn't even make it to
the end of the second act, so...

39:51.587 --> 39:54.522
I remember.

39:54.557 --> 39:57.559
Was that better
or worse than this?

39:57.593 --> 39:59.594
Are you crazy?

39:59.628 --> 40:01.396
<i>Bombshell</i> is the best
Broadway musical

40:01.430 --> 40:02.864
that I have ever seen.

40:02.898 --> 40:05.399
What you did
was extraordinary.

40:09.504 --> 40:10.939
Hey.

40:12.974 --> 40:16.710
You wanna get out of here?

40:16.745 --> 40:19.746
I should really go see
if Jimmy's okay.

40:23.751 --> 40:26.952
All right.

40:26.987 --> 40:29.856
But I don't want to.

40:32.526 --> 40:35.527
Then let's go.

40:43.302 --> 40:44.669
Derek.

40:44.704 --> 40:46.070
God, Daisy Parker.

40:46.105 --> 40:47.272
Do I need to call my lawyer?

40:47.306 --> 40:49.240
Don't worry.
You're safe.

40:49.275 --> 40:51.075
I didn't want to bother you
at the party,

40:51.110 --> 40:52.943
but I saw the show.

40:52.977 --> 40:56.714
Your work was... wonderful.

40:56.748 --> 41:00.150
Yeah, well, you should've
seen it when I directed it.

41:00.184 --> 41:03.521
Look, I'm sorry about
what I did to you last fall.

41:03.555 --> 41:05.122
You were right.

41:05.156 --> 41:06.957
I didn't want to face
that my career was over,

41:06.958 --> 41:09.258
so when those dancers
approached me

41:09.293 --> 41:11.694
and asked me to join them,
I thought,

41:11.729 --> 41:13.730
"maybe this'll get me
back out there."

41:13.764 --> 41:16.299
Guess what.

41:16.333 --> 41:19.436
It didn't?

41:19.470 --> 41:23.872
Be good, Derek.

41:23.907 --> 41:25.908
Hey.

41:31.380 --> 41:34.382
W-what are you doing
right now?

41:36.486 --> 41:38.320
Taxi!

41:38.354 --> 41:40.955
I know <i>The Times</i> isn't
what you wanted, Eileen,

41:40.989 --> 41:42.289
and I'm sorry,

41:42.324 --> 41:44.492
but I think you need to reduce
your advertising budget.

41:44.526 --> 41:46.293
Why?

41:46.328 --> 41:48.095
You don't want to get in
any deeper

41:48.129 --> 41:51.131
until you know
what word of mouth is.

41:55.837 --> 41:57.671
Double it.

41:57.705 --> 42:00.941
I want this show to run longer
than <i>The lion king.</i>

42:00.975 --> 42:03.510
You don't get that
without a rave from <i>The Times.</i>

42:03.544 --> 42:06.580
Screw Richard
and screw <i>The Times.</i>

42:06.614 --> 42:08.482
We've got the best show
in town.

42:08.516 --> 42:10.951
And if I can't get it
from <i>The Times,</i>

42:10.985 --> 42:13.018
we're gonna sweep the Tonys.

42:13.052 --> 42:16.321
- Really?
- Get ready, Agnes.

42:16.356 --> 42:19.458
We've got a campaign
to launch.
