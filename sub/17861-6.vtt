WEBVTT

00:03.140 --> 00:05.300
Thank you for everything.

00:08.020 --> 00:11.738
Hers are the actions of someone
with something significant to hide.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.578
Well, I'm willing to take
a risk on her.

00:13.580 --> 00:15.060
I'm not.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.258
Get out of here!

00:22.260 --> 00:25.860
I'd watch Bert.
Doubt you made a friend there.

00:28.100 --> 00:31.020
What is it?
It's William. He's engaged.

00:45.533 --> 00:47.873
* When the moon hits your eye

00:48.235 --> 00:53.315
* Like a big pizza pie
That's amore... *

00:54.795 --> 00:59.753
* When the world seems to shine
like you've had too much wine

00:59.755 --> 01:02.155
* That's amore

01:05.715 --> 01:07.753
* When you walk in a dream

01:07.755 --> 01:10.755
* But you know
you're not dreaming... *

01:12.574 --> 01:14.974
You're in love.

01:22.641 --> 01:24.601
Don't worry.

01:24.851 --> 01:27.171
We'll be careful.

01:48.211 --> 01:50.929
You said you didn't mind getting
your insulin now I'm doing it.

01:50.931 --> 01:53.809
I don't.
Well?

01:53.811 --> 01:56.249
Why the misery face?

01:56.251 --> 01:58.289
Mum's boyfriend's here.

01:58.291 --> 02:01.649
Oh. He can't be that bad.

02:01.651 --> 02:03.769
Your mum likes him.

02:03.771 --> 02:06.249
I hate him.
Oh, come on. Why would you...?

02:06.251 --> 02:08.568
Keep your bloody
opinions to yourself!

02:08.571 --> 02:10.769
What a joke!

02:10.770 --> 02:12.369
Bert! Wait, I'm sorry!

02:12.371 --> 02:15.131
Sister.
Are you alright?

02:17.051 --> 02:19.049
Running behind is all I am.

02:19.051 --> 02:21.609
Colin, you haven't taken your
sample yet. Go on. In you get.

02:21.611 --> 02:23.531
Eve, his hand print is still
on your face.

02:24.771 --> 02:27.729
Was a misunderstanding is all.
It's a pretty big one.

02:27.731 --> 02:31.369
I'm fine. Honest.
I don't know what got into him.

02:31.371 --> 02:32.889
I do.

02:32.891 --> 02:34.889
Do your sample.

02:34.891 --> 02:38.769
Mum said she likes you and he called
you bad names 'cause you bashed him.

02:38.771 --> 02:40.369
Scoot. Now.

02:40.371 --> 02:42.089
Is that really what happened?

02:42.091 --> 02:43.769
It got around, what you did.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.449
A man has his pride.

02:45.451 --> 02:48.369
If my coming here's a problem, I can
organise another nurse to do it.

02:48.371 --> 02:51.249
Or if you think you can handle
the needles, I can teach you how.

02:51.251 --> 02:52.809
Don't bother.
Colin.

02:52.811 --> 02:54.849
He's just gonna find
some other reason to belt her.

02:54.851 --> 02:56.889
How many times do I have
to tell you... Oh.

02:56.891 --> 02:59.491
Eve?
It's just a cramp.

03:00.731 --> 03:02.969
He pushes and pushes.

03:02.971 --> 03:07.449
He's jealous. Bub expected
and Bert being the dad.

03:07.451 --> 03:11.329
Anyway, better test his wee
or we'll be here all day.

03:11.331 --> 03:12.771
Come on.

03:28.491 --> 03:31.091
This is the wrong door, Miss.
The Ladies' Lounge is through there.

03:37.371 --> 03:39.969
Give it a go. Carn, Sugar Ray.

03:39.971 --> 03:41.609
Hope you've been working
on your jab, mate.

03:41.611 --> 03:43.929
Shut your gobs.
You heard them. That way.

03:43.931 --> 03:46.249
Do you enjoy hitting
a pregnant woman, do you?

03:46.251 --> 03:48.889
Is that your business?
Eve's my patient.

03:48.891 --> 03:50.729
Just piss off, you stupid bitch.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.809
Hey!
It's alright, Roy.

03:52.811 --> 03:56.449
If you ever raise your hand
to her again, I will find you

03:56.451 --> 03:58.689
and I will kick your testicles
so far up your throat,

03:58.691 --> 04:00.971
you'll be eating them for breakfast,
do you understand?

04:04.691 --> 04:06.891
I've downed you before.
I'll do it again.

04:14.051 --> 04:16.571
And good on you, Miss.

04:26.168 --> 04:28.286
'That's Amore'?

04:28.288 --> 04:30.286
It speaks to me.

04:30.288 --> 04:34.206
"Pizza pie. Pasta fazool."
Who even knows what they are?

04:34.208 --> 04:36.966
Italian food, dummy,
and they're delicious.

04:36.968 --> 04:40.886
Right, well, let me tell you firsthand that
love isn't something you can compare to food.

04:40.888 --> 04:41.806
And why not?

04:41.808 --> 04:45.048
Because love's more complex
than that, isn't it, James?

04:46.968 --> 04:49.126
Well, I'm sure
it's different for everyone.

04:49.128 --> 04:51.246
Livvy, if you're not
up to company...

04:51.248 --> 04:52.606
I am.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.526
Where's your grandmother?
We were wondering the same thing.

04:55.528 --> 04:57.968
But enjoying the peace
too much to investigate?

04:59.928 --> 05:01.528
Olivia, how are you?

05:01.812 --> 05:02.872
Improving?

05:02.957 --> 05:05.517
I wasn't aware any improvement
was required.

05:05.756 --> 05:07.876
You have been very quiet.

05:07.881 --> 05:09.561
Excuse my tardiness.

05:09.792 --> 05:13.112
Amy has just been telling me
the most remarkable story

05:13.135 --> 05:15.053
involving Sister Adams.

05:15.055 --> 05:16.533
Mother.

05:16.535 --> 05:20.173
She barged into the public bar
during the six o'clock swill

05:20.175 --> 05:23.055
threatening to rearrange
a man's delicate area.

05:24.038 --> 05:25.598
Amy?

05:25.659 --> 05:29.457
The man was Albert Banks.
My sister Eve's friend.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.297
The shearer, the war widow
and the out-of-wedlock pregnancy

05:32.299 --> 05:33.857
in case you've missed the gossip.

05:33.859 --> 05:38.457
Anna, please. It's sordid enough
without talking about it.

05:38.459 --> 05:40.157
Miss Adams was under the impression

05:40.159 --> 05:42.699
that Bert had struck Eve
during an argument.

05:42.778 --> 05:43.936
Did he?

05:43.938 --> 05:46.936
It's a matter for the police, George,
not the community nurse.

05:46.938 --> 05:48.856
Her behaviour is outrageous.

05:48.858 --> 05:50.856
For heaven's sake.

05:50.858 --> 05:53.976
- Will you just leave her be?
- Livvy.

05:53.978 --> 05:57.418
This ridiculous obsession.

05:59.498 --> 06:00.978
Excuse me.

06:03.218 --> 06:05.496
One has only to mention
the woman's name

06:05.498 --> 06:07.376
and decency flies out the window.

06:07.378 --> 06:09.098
You may serve.

06:15.818 --> 06:17.578
I want to be alone.

06:23.938 --> 06:25.936
Not until you tell me
what's going on.

06:25.938 --> 06:27.536
Nothing's going on.

06:27.538 --> 06:29.056
That was not nothing.
Please.

06:29.058 --> 06:31.056
You've been strange for days.
What is it? Tell me.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.138
Will you please just go?

06:39.298 --> 06:42.978
Once you've composed yourself,
Grandmother deserves an apology.

07:27.218 --> 07:29.296
This will be for you, Missy.

07:29.298 --> 07:31.536
Morning, Mr. Bligh.
Hey, Roy.

07:31.538 --> 07:33.496
Sorry to barge in so early.

07:33.498 --> 07:35.976
No need to apologise to me
for keeping farmer's hours.

07:35.978 --> 07:37.976
Wanted to make sure
I caught you before you left.

07:37.978 --> 07:39.696
Now, what she did yesterday
was as right

07:39.698 --> 07:41.538
as what that animal did was wrong.

07:42.898 --> 07:46.736
Let me guess?
Your mother heard and hit the roof.

07:46.738 --> 07:49.776
The ceiling maybe.
Oh, I'm off my game.

07:49.778 --> 07:52.216
I'm not here to give you a lecture.

07:52.218 --> 07:55.816
I thought I might get reprimanded
for invading the public bar.

07:55.818 --> 08:01.776
Inverness, it isn't London. It
isn't even Sydney, for that matter.

08:01.778 --> 08:04.298
Say it.

08:04.635 --> 08:07.753
Some people think Eve Walker is
simply getting what she deserves.

08:07.755 --> 08:09.233
She deserves to be beaten?

08:09.235 --> 08:11.353
She's having a younger man's
illegitimate child, Sarah.

08:11.355 --> 08:13.033
This is a small country town.

08:13.035 --> 08:14.873
I didn't do what I did
to make friends.

08:14.875 --> 08:17.513
I understand your sense
of injustice. I share it.

08:17.515 --> 08:19.673
But if you need help with Bert Ford

08:19.675 --> 08:23.033
or any other man in the future,
come to me.

08:23.035 --> 08:26.313
I learnt to take care of myself
a long time ago,

08:26.315 --> 08:28.155
but I appreciate your concern.

08:30.155 --> 08:32.113
You must be tired
of supporting someone

08:32.115 --> 08:33.993
who only seems to make
your life more difficult.

08:33.995 --> 08:37.635
'Interesting' is the word
that I'd use.

08:40.635 --> 08:42.715
The offer is there.

08:52.995 --> 08:54.833
What are you doing?

08:54.835 --> 08:58.993
I'm looking for the wedding album.
Have you seen it?

08:58.995 --> 09:02.193
You had it out
when the Swansons were here.

09:02.195 --> 09:04.353
Is it really that urgent?

09:04.355 --> 09:06.873
I thought if we sat down
and looked at it,

09:06.875 --> 09:08.593
you'd remember
how happy we can be.

09:08.595 --> 09:11.633
James, I was sound asleep.

09:11.635 --> 09:14.273
Where is it? Livvy?

09:14.275 --> 09:15.873
Do you really want to know?

09:15.875 --> 09:19.395
Yes.
It's gone. I ripped it to shreds.

09:20.555 --> 09:22.473
Why on earth would you do that?

09:22.475 --> 09:26.153
Because I never want to be reminded
of that hypocritical day

09:26.155 --> 09:29.435
I married the man
who loves my brother.

09:33.795 --> 09:36.193
You heard me.

09:36.195 --> 09:38.193
Well, that's ridiculous.

09:38.195 --> 09:40.675
It made everything
suddenly make sense.

09:40.723 --> 09:42.681
I'm calling Dr. Duncan.
I don't need a doctor.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.001
Clearly you're not coping.

09:44.003 --> 09:47.483
You leave without admitting it,
this marriage is over.

09:55.443 --> 09:57.161
You don't mean that.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.961
If not for the baby,
it already would be.

10:00.963 --> 10:05.441
I don't know if we've
any hope for a future,

10:05.443 --> 10:10.161
but if you don't tell me
the truth right now,

10:10.163 --> 10:13.003
I will pack and leave.

10:14.163 --> 10:15.843
Tell me.

10:17.003 --> 10:23.441
After what you did by marrying me,
it is the least you can do.

10:23.443 --> 10:25.883
Tell me.

10:34.203 --> 10:38.723
We were at... at Balliol together.

10:40.083 --> 10:42.363
We shared tutorials.

10:43.763 --> 10:46.001
Sports.

10:46.003 --> 10:47.563
Spare moments and...

10:49.923 --> 10:52.363
Well, we became friends.

10:53.763 --> 10:55.443
And...

10:58.323 --> 10:59.803
Please, you're gonna hate me.

11:07.723 --> 11:09.963
It seemed like there were
two different worlds.

11:11.963 --> 11:15.401
The real one, the one in public,

11:15.403 --> 11:19.361
that was demanding and judgemental.

11:19.363 --> 11:21.803
And then there was this other world.

11:23.123 --> 11:26.403
The one in private.
Inside our rooms.

11:28.403 --> 11:31.161
We could be open
with each other. Free.

11:31.163 --> 11:36.483
Discuss all our problems and fears,
struggles and dreams.

11:37.723 --> 11:43.483
And after a while,
it... seemed only natural that we...

11:44.643 --> 11:46.123
shared...

11:54.243 --> 11:56.561
All those trips to our estate.

11:56.563 --> 11:59.361
All those parties.

11:59.363 --> 12:02.963
I knew you never looked at me.

12:05.123 --> 12:07.323
How could I be so blind?

12:19.083 --> 12:20.803
You weren't the only one.

12:23.723 --> 12:27.161
Grandmother was the only one
who saw it for what it was.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.401
She arrived for my graduation
and just...

12:29.403 --> 12:33.721
And that was when
you proposed to me.

12:33.723 --> 12:38.321
Well, I had to get married
like a normal person.

12:38.323 --> 12:41.521
Your grandmother said
it couldn't go on, didn't she?

12:41.523 --> 12:44.801
She knew that since she'd noticed,
eventually others would too,

12:44.803 --> 12:46.281
and they'd start to talk.

12:46.283 --> 12:48.841
And where would that leave
the great Bligh name?

12:48.843 --> 12:50.641
So what did you do?

12:50.643 --> 12:56.881
You thought, "Who is the most stupid,
desperate, gullible woman I know?"

12:56.883 --> 12:58.601
No.
I don't believe you.

12:58.603 --> 13:01.441
It wasn't like that.
Then what was it like, James?

13:01.443 --> 13:04.363
Why did you choose me?

13:05.963 --> 13:09.481
Why?

13:09.483 --> 13:12.443
Because you reminded me of him,
alright?

13:17.803 --> 13:20.443
I'm sorry.

13:23.203 --> 13:25.403
You asked for honesty.

13:27.203 --> 13:29.003
That's how it started.

13:31.203 --> 13:36.081
But, Livvy, I love you for you now.
Not him, not anymore.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.641
No, I saw your face when the telegram
came about his engagement.

13:39.643 --> 13:42.883
You looked like you wanted to die.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.963
No, we... we agreed
to leave it behind us.

13:49.003 --> 13:51.561
But?

13:51.563 --> 13:56.123
Just... give me time.
I'll forget him. I promise.

13:59.603 --> 14:02.843
Is it only your grandmother
who knows?

14:04.323 --> 14:06.883
If it can stay that way.

14:08.523 --> 14:13.483
Why should anyone else
have to feel this disgust?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.130
We have a disaster.

14:58.290 --> 15:01.898
Olivia?
Not now.

15:02.230 --> 15:05.190
We have to talk.

15:07.459 --> 15:09.257
Oh, don't be foolish, dear.

15:09.259 --> 15:12.297
I said not now.

15:12.399 --> 15:14.117
Olivia.

15:14.419 --> 15:17.097
We do need to talk.

15:17.099 --> 15:18.739
Olivia?

15:22.979 --> 15:24.859
Later.

15:32.379 --> 15:35.980
She said she wouldn't tell anyone.
I'm sure she won't.

15:36.079 --> 15:38.157
No, let her come to us
when she's ready.

15:38.159 --> 15:40.797
We both know who's to blame.

15:40.799 --> 15:42.477
Who?

15:42.479 --> 15:45.157
Olivia's questions started
the minute she barged in here

15:45.159 --> 15:47.077
babbling about
your suicide attempt.

15:47.079 --> 15:48.917
Sarah?

15:48.919 --> 15:51.317
From the minute she arrived,
something like this was inevitable.

15:51.319 --> 15:53.599
For heaven's sake.
She will rue the day.

15:59.399 --> 16:01.357
If it's more work, go away.

16:01.359 --> 16:03.197
I've got enough already.

16:03.199 --> 16:06.077
Sister Adams no longer works here.

16:06.079 --> 16:07.957
She's gone?

16:07.959 --> 16:10.077
She will be as soon as you fire her.

16:10.079 --> 16:13.117
I'm not asking and if necessary
I will go over your head

16:13.119 --> 16:15.837
to the hospital board - I'm hoping
to spare you that humiliation.

16:15.839 --> 16:17.317
Elizabeth.

16:17.319 --> 16:20.957
This is not a conversation, Doctor.
Fire her.

16:20.959 --> 16:23.999
You can't keep doing this.
Exactly.

16:37.839 --> 16:39.957
What did you do to Elizabeth?

16:39.959 --> 16:42.877
I haven't seen her for days. Why?

16:42.879 --> 16:45.237
She's on the warpath again.
I have no idea.

16:45.239 --> 16:47.197
I've had just about enough of this.

16:47.199 --> 16:49.317
I can only assume
it's to do with yesterday.

16:49.319 --> 16:51.477
Something that happened
at the pub.

16:51.479 --> 16:53.757
Yeah, well, whatever it is,
don't make it any worse.

16:53.759 --> 16:57.039
I can only protect you so much, and
this time I'm not even sure of that.

17:08.439 --> 17:09.916
- Oh!
- For you.

17:09.919 --> 17:11.797
Hello.

17:11.799 --> 17:14.597
Oh, I haven't stopped humming it.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.396
Now you can hum it in tune, huh?

17:17.398 --> 17:19.196
You sing like an angel.

17:19.199 --> 17:21.277
An angel would think
to bring you something.

17:21.279 --> 17:23.118
Oh, you don't have to.

17:27.079 --> 17:30.279
I love you so much.
I love you too.

17:41.679 --> 17:43.237
What is it?

17:43.239 --> 17:45.157
Nothing.

17:45.159 --> 17:48.239
You don't want to?
Of course.

17:50.359 --> 17:53.117
For so long I've been told
it's wrong.

17:53.119 --> 17:55.877
You know, by Mamma and Papa.

17:55.879 --> 17:57.957
Caro...
Father Joe.

17:57.959 --> 18:02.637
What we do, he'd say we'd be in hell
already for what we do.

18:02.639 --> 18:06.317
I don't believe that.
I know, but...

18:06.319 --> 18:07.839
This isn't hell.

18:09.519 --> 18:11.639
This is heaven.

18:14.079 --> 18:16.519
If something were to go wrong?

18:18.919 --> 18:21.279
Well, then we'll have to make sure
it doesn't, won't we?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.039
Come on.

18:31.039 --> 18:33.877
Come on!

18:33.879 --> 18:35.439
Come on.

18:38.079 --> 18:40.359
Come on!

18:45.519 --> 18:47.477
Whoa.

18:47.479 --> 18:50.037
Whoa-oa. Whoa-oa.

18:50.039 --> 18:51.959
Whoa-oh. Whoa-oa.

19:10.799 --> 19:16.197
You say you love me
but... I don't know who you are.

19:16.199 --> 19:19.877
I look at you, the man I married,

19:19.879 --> 19:23.117
and I see a... stranger.

19:23.119 --> 19:24.757
That's not true.

19:24.759 --> 19:26.679
No.

19:29.399 --> 19:33.077
The fact remains
that I did marry you.

19:33.079 --> 19:37.957
For the sake of our child,
and our child alone,

19:37.959 --> 19:41.399
I will try to honour that.

19:44.239 --> 19:46.677
That side of you...

19:46.679 --> 19:48.799
It's over.

19:50.479 --> 19:52.759
Swear it on your life.

19:54.359 --> 19:57.999
I swear... it's over.

21:53.639 --> 21:55.799
Anna.

21:57.359 --> 22:02.197
I was just thinking about you.
This is so strange.

22:02.199 --> 22:03.717
What are you doing here?

22:03.719 --> 22:05.757
Just needed to relax for a moment.

22:05.759 --> 22:10.277
We should go riding again.
I'd love that. Soon.

22:10.279 --> 22:12.239
I was wondering...

22:13.959 --> 22:15.517
This is embarrassing.

22:15.519 --> 22:18.277
Yes?

22:18.279 --> 22:20.437
You know Gino?

22:20.439 --> 22:22.157
Yes.

22:22.159 --> 22:24.717
And... well...

22:24.719 --> 22:28.479
He was just here and he and I...

22:30.119 --> 22:31.837
You know I like him?

22:31.839 --> 22:34.999
Yes?
I love him.

22:36.799 --> 22:39.557
Please, don't make me say it.
Anna.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.717
But I love him and he loves me.

22:41.719 --> 22:43.197
And we're going to be married.

22:43.199 --> 22:46.077
We are, we're going to tell everyone
and get married, but not now.

22:46.079 --> 22:47.997
The time, it has to be right.
Anna, please.

22:47.999 --> 22:51.277
And it's not dirty or anything
like that. It's not.

22:51.279 --> 22:55.197
It's actually wonderful, but we
can't risk anything happening.

22:55.199 --> 22:58.757
You understand, like an accident?
Anna, just stop now.

22:58.759 --> 23:01.957
I know what you're going to ask
and I... I can't help you.

23:01.959 --> 23:04.957
But you're a nurse.
I'm a friend of your father.

23:04.959 --> 23:07.477
I just want help, some advice.

23:07.479 --> 23:10.879
I can't repay his generosity
by helping you get birth control.

23:12.399 --> 23:15.039
He'd never have to know.
I would.

23:17.999 --> 23:19.637
Talk to Dr. Duncan.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.797
I can't ask Jack.
He's a doctor.

23:21.799 --> 23:23.357
He watched me grow up.

23:23.359 --> 23:25.917
What does the fact you can't tell him
what you're doing

23:25.919 --> 23:27.397
say about what you're doing?

23:27.399 --> 23:29.997
Don't make it sound dirty. It's not.

23:29.999 --> 23:32.317
Please don't break
your father's heart.

23:32.319 --> 23:34.759
I won't.

23:37.439 --> 23:40.359
If you're going to continue,
you must take precautions.

23:41.719 --> 23:44.119
Do find someone to help you.

24:26.319 --> 24:28.117
Gino, where are you going?
Town.

24:28.119 --> 24:31.199
What?
I gotta get something.

24:37.879 --> 24:40.439
I told you to shut your mouth,
didn't I? Didn't I?

24:57.879 --> 25:00.119
Mum! Mum!

25:06.199 --> 25:08.319
Mum.

25:09.639 --> 25:11.119
Mum.

25:30.199 --> 25:31.957
Sister!

25:31.959 --> 25:35.279
Sister! Help. Come quick!

25:39.039 --> 25:42.999
It's Mum. Mum's hurt. Please, come.

25:49.448 --> 25:51.568
He smashed her into a chair.

25:51.704 --> 25:53.622
Eve.
Sorry.

25:53.624 --> 25:55.702
Colin says that
you've hurt your back.

25:55.704 --> 25:57.542
Can you... can you move your legs?

25:57.544 --> 25:59.382
I...

25:59.384 --> 26:02.342
OK, don't try to talk,
just squeeze my hand

26:02.344 --> 26:04.144
if you can feel me touching them.

26:06.024 --> 26:07.502
Is she gonna be OK?

26:07.504 --> 26:10.302
You can hope
for a bit better than OK.

26:10.304 --> 26:13.462
I'm sorry. I've wet myself.

26:13.464 --> 26:15.022
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

26:15.024 --> 26:18.984
I'm just gonna quickly examine
the baby. Please don't move.

26:20.344 --> 26:23.344
You're doing really well.

26:25.464 --> 26:28.182
Your waters have broken.
Colin, listen to me.

26:28.184 --> 26:31.702
Ride to Ash Park and get Aunty Amy
to call the ambulance immediately.

26:31.704 --> 26:33.622
You understand?

26:33.624 --> 26:35.624
Go! Quickly!

26:38.384 --> 26:41.462
Let's just lift your head up. There.

26:41.464 --> 26:44.584
Gently. Gently.

27:03.304 --> 27:07.342
Eve, listen to me. There's something
important I have to ask you.

27:07.344 --> 27:09.942
When you had Colin,
how long was your labour?

27:09.944 --> 27:11.902
An hour. Less.

27:11.904 --> 27:13.582
Right.

27:13.584 --> 27:16.702
I don't want to scare you,
but we have a choice to make.

27:16.704 --> 27:19.782
Ideally, we would wait
and deliver by caesarean.

27:19.784 --> 27:22.742
But with your back and your history

27:22.744 --> 27:24.744
and if the ambulance
takes too long...

27:26.264 --> 27:28.462
you could lose sensation
at any time

27:28.464 --> 27:30.102
and you wouldn't be able to push.

27:30.104 --> 27:32.024
What could happen to the baby?

27:33.544 --> 27:36.902
I wanna get this bub out
as quickly as possible.

27:36.904 --> 27:40.424
It will be painful, but if we
work together, we can do it.

27:41.904 --> 27:43.422
Will you trust me?

27:43.424 --> 27:46.542
The baby could die?

27:46.544 --> 27:48.582
Yes.

27:48.584 --> 27:50.982
Alright.

27:50.984 --> 27:52.864
Thank you.

27:55.584 --> 27:57.182
OK.

27:57.184 --> 27:59.782
What's that?
Castor oil.

27:59.784 --> 28:01.022
To make the labour even faster.

28:01.024 --> 28:02.944
Here we go.

28:04.744 --> 28:08.784
Eugh! Argh!

28:23.704 --> 28:27.062
Oh, her decision
is a great relief.

28:27.064 --> 28:28.704
The look in her eyes.

28:30.464 --> 28:33.262
Shock.
Disgust.

28:33.264 --> 28:36.222
You have to help her understand.

28:36.224 --> 28:38.302
I'll happily wear
the label of villain

28:38.304 --> 28:40.382
if it helps her to forgive you.

28:40.384 --> 28:43.544
There's only one label
to wear, and it's mine.

28:45.744 --> 28:50.904
It's what you were.
Not what you are. Convince her.

28:54.744 --> 28:57.742
And remember,
you have a child to live for.

28:57.744 --> 29:00.702
I'm not gonna do anything foolish.

29:00.704 --> 29:02.544
Good.

29:04.304 --> 29:06.342
What on earth?

29:06.344 --> 29:08.622
Aunty Amy, Aunty Amy!

29:08.624 --> 29:10.662
Are you out of your mind?
You're not allowed...

29:10.664 --> 29:13.862
It's Mum. It's an emergency.
Is it the baby?

29:13.864 --> 29:16.662
I dunno. It's...
She's hurt. He hurt her.

29:16.664 --> 29:19.062
Slow down. Slow down, son.
What's the matter?

29:19.064 --> 29:22.542
Mum's hurt. Bad. Sister Adams
wants to get her to hospital.

29:22.544 --> 29:25.422
Did Sister Adams send you?
So Aunty could call the ambulance.

29:25.424 --> 29:27.502
James, place the call. Wait here.

29:27.504 --> 29:30.104
I'll get my keys.
I'll drive you both over.

29:32.024 --> 29:34.064
George, let Norman take them.

29:54.104 --> 29:56.662
I need to check your dilation.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.502
I'm going to have to separate

29:58.504 --> 29:59.982
and raise your legs.

29:59.984 --> 30:02.224
I'm sorry but it's gonna hurt.

30:08.384 --> 30:12.102
Oh. I think I've...

30:12.104 --> 30:14.302
That's OK. That's OK.

30:14.304 --> 30:15.904
That just means...

30:18.264 --> 30:20.822
castor oil worked,
you're ready to start pushing.

30:20.824 --> 30:23.342
It's gonna hurt but you have to try.

30:23.344 --> 30:25.062
Give it a go. Yes?

30:25.064 --> 30:28.142
I'm sorry, Eve. I'm sorry.

30:28.144 --> 30:30.664
Push and it will all be
over with, OK? Push!

30:33.824 --> 30:36.462
Again, push.
I can't.

30:36.464 --> 30:38.222
Push.
I can't.

30:39.493 --> 30:41.338
Rest.

30:41.404 --> 30:43.519
Mummy!

30:45.424 --> 30:47.702
This isn't something he should see.
Of course.

30:47.704 --> 30:51.222
And I... I could use some fresh towels
and boiling water.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.702
Go on in, son.
Is she OK?

30:52.704 --> 30:55.342
Yes, she's having the baby.
Amy, Amy, come and help.

30:55.344 --> 30:57.662
I can't. I'm sorry.

30:57.664 --> 31:00.304
It's alright. You look after Colin.
I'll help out here.

31:05.624 --> 31:06.942
Whatever you need.

31:06.944 --> 31:10.102
Eve, George Bligh's gonna help us
give it another go.

31:10.104 --> 31:13.422
No, please.
There's no need to feel embarrassed.

31:13.424 --> 31:16.902
It's almost here. It's her back
injury, it's making it agony.

31:16.904 --> 31:20.462
Eve, everything is gonna be fine.

31:20.464 --> 31:22.022
The ambulance is on its way.

31:22.024 --> 31:23.622
But we're gonna keep going,
aren't we, Eve?

31:23.624 --> 31:25.742
We can't risk harming baby
by stopping now.

31:25.744 --> 31:27.342
Just take her leg.

31:27.344 --> 31:29.142
Careful.

31:29.144 --> 31:30.902
Now, ready for another try?

31:30.904 --> 31:32.582
I can't. It hurts.

31:32.584 --> 31:35.222
Yes, you can.
It hurts so much.

31:35.224 --> 31:37.862
That's why we wanna get it over
and done with. What do you say?

31:37.864 --> 31:41.022
Alright, Eve. On the count of three.

31:41.024 --> 31:43.584
One, two...

31:56.664 --> 31:59.022
I think it best you close the door.

31:59.024 --> 32:02.582
James never would have done what
he did to me without being forced.

32:02.584 --> 32:04.222
My dear, that's...

32:04.224 --> 32:05.824
Don't.

32:07.104 --> 32:11.222
This is your house
and I will respect that,

32:11.224 --> 32:15.904
and I will respect the need
to keep this between we three.

32:17.624 --> 32:20.824
But I will never respect you again.

32:31.424 --> 32:33.182
That's it. That's it, Eve.

32:33.184 --> 32:34.942
That's good, Eve. Again.

32:34.944 --> 32:37.382
Again!

32:37.384 --> 32:38.982
Mummy!

32:38.984 --> 32:40.982
Inside, Colin. Now.

32:40.984 --> 32:44.022
Keep going, Eve. Amy!

32:44.024 --> 32:45.742
I can't.

32:45.744 --> 32:47.702
You just did.
A couple more, Eve. Push.

32:47.704 --> 32:49.542
- Push, Eve.
- Almost there.

32:49.544 --> 32:52.262
Push, you can do it.

32:52.264 --> 32:54.262
No, it hurts.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.742
Come on, Eve. One more time.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.782
The baby needs you to, Eve. Push!

32:58.784 --> 33:00.304
Almost there.
Come on, push.

33:12.704 --> 33:15.744
Well done, Eve. Well done.

33:18.744 --> 33:20.944
There you go.

33:23.064 --> 33:25.102
Well done, Eve.

33:25.104 --> 33:29.022
Oh, my goodness. She's beautiful.

33:29.024 --> 33:30.504
Congratulations.

33:57.714 --> 33:59.374
We suspect two fractured vertebrae.

34:00.035 --> 34:02.595
She's stabilised.
We'll operate once we're sure.

34:02.613 --> 34:05.411
Would you send any bills to me?
She's gonna be in for a while.

34:05.413 --> 34:07.331
I don't care how much or how long.

34:07.333 --> 34:09.051
Good on you.

34:09.053 --> 34:10.571
That's the least I can do.

34:10.572 --> 34:12.170
She's asking for you both.

34:12.172 --> 34:14.491
Her family?
Over there.

34:14.493 --> 34:16.253
Keep it short.

34:30.132 --> 34:31.610
Sister.

34:31.612 --> 34:36.170
Mr. Bligh. I'm so sorry
you had to see me like that.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.650
It's alright.

34:37.652 --> 34:39.571
Now, I've spoken to Dr. Duncan.

34:39.572 --> 34:41.811
I'd like to look after
all of your expenses.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.610
And we'll look at whatever help
you need to keep the farm going.

34:44.612 --> 34:47.172
You're so kind.
Just get better.

34:54.853 --> 34:57.130
Sister.
Yes?

34:57.132 --> 35:00.291
Could I name
my little girl after you?

35:00.293 --> 35:03.251
I'd be honoured, but that's...

35:03.253 --> 35:05.131
Don't worry about Bert.

35:05.133 --> 35:08.453
After what you've done,
he'll forget all that other stuff.

35:09.893 --> 35:12.331
I know he's not perfect.

35:12.333 --> 35:15.131
But he'll make a good dad.

35:15.133 --> 35:18.453
You know him better than I do.

35:19.733 --> 35:22.331
Could I ask one more thing?
Sure.

35:22.333 --> 35:26.771
Could you find him,
tell him his little girl's here?

35:26.773 --> 35:28.971
Yeah.

35:30.526 --> 35:32.195
Rest.

35:40.333 --> 35:42.773
OK, not for long.
She needs to rest.

35:44.253 --> 35:46.013
Thank you.

35:49.733 --> 35:54.171
A lumbar spine fracture coupled
with an emergency parturition.

35:54.173 --> 35:55.651
Amazing.

35:55.653 --> 35:58.291
I took a punt and hoped to God
it was the right choice.

35:58.293 --> 35:59.891
If you'd waited for the ambulance,

35:59.893 --> 36:02.331
there's a good chance both Eve
and the baby would be dead.

36:02.333 --> 36:05.131
I was just doing my job.
It's yours for as long as you want.

36:05.133 --> 36:09.851
There's no way Elizabeth's gonna be
able to justify your dismissal now.

36:09.853 --> 36:11.811
It's your get out of jail free card.

36:11.813 --> 36:14.531
Eve went through hell.
It's hard to celebrate.

36:14.533 --> 36:17.531
And now I've gotta find that brute
and let him know he's a father.

36:17.533 --> 36:20.971
No need. It's been taken care of.

36:20.973 --> 36:25.613
See, that's good.
That's good. Means she understands.

36:30.093 --> 36:32.013
What?

36:35.053 --> 36:37.091
Eve and your daughter
are at the hospital.

36:37.093 --> 36:39.771
You can thank Sarah Adams
they're alive.

36:39.773 --> 36:41.733
I always knew you were scum, Ford.

36:42.933 --> 36:47.053
Today... just confirmed it.

36:49.093 --> 36:53.291
Any man in this town who raises
his hand against a woman,

36:53.293 --> 36:57.413
any man, will suffer
the consequences.

36:59.413 --> 37:01.453
I won't stand for it.

37:02.973 --> 37:04.491
Hear, hear, Mr. Bligh.

37:04.493 --> 37:06.773
Hear, hear, Mr. Bligh!

37:08.173 --> 37:09.811
You're a father now.

37:09.813 --> 37:12.013
Act like one.

37:39.453 --> 37:41.133
Anna!

37:42.173 --> 37:45.651
What are you doing?
I have to see you.

37:45.653 --> 37:48.851
You're crazy!
Only for you!

37:48.853 --> 37:50.651
Come down!

37:50.653 --> 37:52.813
No, you come up!

37:54.533 --> 37:57.251
Go on!

37:57.253 --> 37:59.933
Yeah, do it.

38:39.373 --> 38:40.933
Go, go!

38:44.013 --> 38:45.731
I almost ran straight
into your nonna!

38:45.733 --> 38:48.251
Shhh. James and Olivia,
they're next door.

38:48.253 --> 38:51.091
Do you think I'm crazy?
I wanted you here with... with me.

38:51.093 --> 38:53.171
I missed you.
I missed you too.

38:53.173 --> 38:54.853
I missed all of you.

38:57.693 --> 38:59.771
It's OK, no-one's going to come in.

38:59.773 --> 39:01.731
It's not that.

39:01.733 --> 39:04.653
It's just... I came because...

39:07.293 --> 39:09.571
I wanna talk.
Later!

39:09.573 --> 39:11.213
No.

39:14.973 --> 39:16.971
Are you still worried about the risk?

39:16.973 --> 39:19.611
Because I... I've written
to my aunt in Sydney,

39:19.613 --> 39:21.731
and she'll help us, I'm sure of it.

39:21.733 --> 39:25.251
You know what we talked about?

39:25.253 --> 39:28.891
Yes.
How what we do is wrong?

39:28.893 --> 39:31.931
Yes, but... if I...
It is.

39:31.933 --> 39:33.533
In the eyes of the Church.

39:35.213 --> 39:36.891
It is.

39:36.893 --> 39:40.011
Well, we can stop.
No.

39:40.013 --> 39:41.571
But you believe it's wrong.

39:41.573 --> 39:43.293
Because we're not married.

39:46.893 --> 39:48.533
So I was thinking, uh...

39:49.613 --> 39:52.333
Maybe we could make it right?

39:53.773 --> 39:55.891
More right.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.413
If we...
What?

40:00.733 --> 40:02.333
Anna...

40:03.973 --> 40:05.971
I wanna be with you.

40:05.973 --> 40:08.771
Together. Forever.

40:08.773 --> 40:11.813
We will be. We will.

40:13.693 --> 40:14.933
Anna...

40:24.493 --> 40:26.213
Marry me.

40:29.493 --> 40:31.811
I will. I will.

40:31.813 --> 40:34.453
I will marry you.

41:04.636 --> 41:08.236
I will not fire Sarah Adams
just because you want me to.

41:08.651 --> 41:12.329
I've never tugged my forelock to you
before and I won't do it now.

41:12.331 --> 41:16.031
I thought you understood.
Negotiations are over.

41:16.034 --> 41:19.114
Too right they are.
Then I will go to the board.

41:19.230 --> 41:20.908
And say what?

41:20.910 --> 41:23.628
You don't like her?

41:23.630 --> 41:25.628
You can't fault her nursing,
Elizabeth.

41:25.630 --> 41:27.108
Her behaviour has been absolutely...

41:27.110 --> 41:29.830
There are explanations
for everything she has done.

41:30.096 --> 41:31.976
Good ones.

41:33.696 --> 41:35.254
Same be said for you?

41:35.256 --> 41:39.694
She won't be the only one on trial
in that room, I'll make sure of it.

41:39.696 --> 41:41.654
Are you quite finished?

41:41.656 --> 41:43.294
After what Sarah did today,

41:43.296 --> 41:47.496
you'll only damage yourself
by attacking her.

41:49.856 --> 41:52.374
I'm trying to spare YOU
the humiliation.

41:52.376 --> 41:56.176
You've made your position clear.

41:57.536 --> 41:59.096
Go.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.214
Thank you.

42:32.216 --> 42:34.014
What for?

42:34.016 --> 42:36.416
You know what.
