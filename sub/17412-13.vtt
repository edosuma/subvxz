        Valentine's day.

       - Do you not like
        valentine's day?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.644
   - It's such a consumerist
       holiday, you know?

00:12.646 --> 00:14.413
    Why should you be forced
      to buy me a present

00:14.415 --> 00:15.714
  Just because the government
          told you to?

00:15.716 --> 00:16.782
            - Right?

00:16.784 --> 00:18.650
  - You didn't plan anything,
            did you?

00:18.652 --> 00:21.186
         - Nothing big.
            - Good.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.788
So we walking to school or what?

00:22.790 --> 00:28.260

      give me one second?

      She doesn't want it!

00:37.371 --> 00:38.504
     - Send the horse back?

00:38.506 --> 00:39.805
   I don't know how to drive
          this thing!

00:39.807 --> 00:41.173
  I'm here for the spectacle!

00:41.175 --> 00:43.342

01:34.762 --> 01:36.361
       How are you doing?
       Are you all right?

01:36.363 --> 01:38.230
    - There was a pancake in
         my dumbwaiter.

01:38.232 --> 01:39.465
     What's going on here?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.433
       - Well, you know,
     it's valentine's day.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.136
   It must be especially hard
        for you, 'cause,

01:44.138 --> 01:46.505
   You know, you're obviously
             alone.

01:46.507 --> 01:49.374
 - [laughs] yeah, so these are
         pity pancakes?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.777
 Fiona, I am single by choice.

01:51.779 --> 01:55.681
   - It's okay, you can wear
   your heart on your sleeve

01:55.683 --> 01:57.282
           Around me.
    - This is such nonsense.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.618
   Let me tell you something.
        Valentine's day

01:59.620 --> 02:02.187
  Is the best day of the year
       to hit on women--

02:02.189 --> 02:03.589
      - That's disgusting.
         - And tonight,

02:03.591 --> 02:07.860
    I am going out, and I am
   bringing the best wingman

02:07.862 --> 02:09.695
 This good earth has ever seen,

         - Yo, yo, yo.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.366
  - That bastion of good life
            choices.

02:14.368 --> 02:18.670

    an old favorite of ours

02:18.672 --> 02:20.439
      Called "sad cupid."

02:20.441 --> 02:21.573
 You know what I'm going to do
            for you?

02:21.575 --> 02:24.343
   I am going to show you how
       "sad cupid" works.

02:24.345 --> 02:26.512
 All right, let's just pretend
         for a moment.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.615
         This is a bar,
  you are an attractive woman.

02:29.617 --> 02:32.151
    Attractive to me, okay?

02:32.153 --> 02:34.186
        Oka--never mind,
 let's just move on, all right.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.687
 You're here with your friends,
           I come up,

02:35.689 --> 02:37.456
     I say something like,

02:37.458 --> 02:39.525
   Hey ladies, how you doing?

02:39.527 --> 02:44.329
    Yeah, I really like your
           tank top.

02:44.331 --> 02:48.734
  Anyway, it's kind of a weird
  night to be at a bar, right?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.402
    Yeah, I wasn't going to
        go out tonight,

02:50.404 --> 02:54.373
  But my friend tj over there,
  that handsome fella, is just

02:54.375 --> 02:56.642
    Having a really, really
          tough time.

02:56.644 --> 02:58.844
 Yeah, he got his heart broken.
            [sighs]

02:58.846 --> 03:02.314
 You know, this may seem weird,
      but would one of you

03:02.316 --> 03:04.249
   Go over there and buy him
            a drink?

03:04.251 --> 03:07.452
I just--I want him to believe in
          love again.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.656
- I keep thinking you can't sink
           any lower,

03:10.658 --> 03:11.790
        And then you do.

03:11.792 --> 03:13.692
  - I'm sorry, did I just hear
           threesome?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.428
       I'm so flattered,
        and I'd love to,

03:16.430 --> 03:17.696
 But I couldn't do that to tj.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.464
   One of you should go over
           with him.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.567
 And that's the thing, you send
the unattractive one over there,

03:21.569 --> 03:23.235
So you can head over there now.

03:23.237 --> 03:25.938
  And then I'm speaking to her
  and we're just vibing it up.

03:25.940 --> 03:29.208
  Oh, you live in a sorority?
          That's fun.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.577
          That's fun.
    Oh, you have a jacuzzi?

03:31.579 --> 03:34.413
      Oh, no, no, no, no.
     That's...That's okay.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.747
  I don't have a bathing suit
            either.

03:37.317 --> 03:39.418
             - Ooh.

03:39.420 --> 03:40.786
        Wha--what is it?

03:40.788 --> 03:41.987
      - It's the tooth of
         a baby gibbon

03:41.989 --> 03:43.622
   I befriended in indonesia.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.591
 They're a remarkably romantic
            species.

03:45.593 --> 03:48.327
      They're monogamous.
  - Oh, that's very romantic.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.828
            - Yeah.
  - I'll treasure it forever,

03:49.830 --> 03:50.963
           Thank you.

03:50.965 --> 03:53.999
          [baby cries]
        oh, my goddess.

03:54.001 --> 03:56.435
     That's my doula ring.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.671

 - Your first baby being born.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.840
    And on valentine's day!
          How magical!

04:01.842 --> 04:04.509
    - Okay, okay, let's go.

04:04.511 --> 04:06.378
         - Wait, I--oh.

04:06.380 --> 04:07.913
   Shea's coming over to see
 marcus--I've gotta call will.

04:07.915 --> 04:09.848
     - No, no, no, hold on.
       I can watch them.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.350
           - Really?

04:11.352 --> 04:12.985
   - I'd love the opportunity
       to bond with him.

04:12.987 --> 04:15.587
   - Oh...You're a wonderful,
        remarkable man.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.922
         - Bup-bup-bup.

Wait, here, in case she doesn't
         like the uke.

04:22.863 --> 04:24.796
   - No offense but, I mean,
    who doesn't like a uke?

04:24.798 --> 04:26.365
           - Well...

04:26.367 --> 04:29.368
    - Happy valentine's day.
    - Happy valentine's day.

    It's gonna be a rockin'
         Friday night.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.688
- You'll barely know he's here.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.523
      He'll be invisible.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.624
  - I got a great idea, guys.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.026
       - Can you give me

04:54.028 --> 04:56.395
  Just one minute--I'm sorry.
            - Again?

04:56.397 --> 04:59.031
    - This is supposed to be
    my first in-house date,

04:59.033 --> 05:00.966
       And you're really
      c-blocking me here.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.368
          - Excuse me?
       - A cuddle block.

 Will calls me it all the time.

05:04.705 --> 05:07.072
    I just--I want to cuddle
       and watch a movie.

05:07.074 --> 05:08.640
  - Look, I promised your mom
         I'd supervise.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.876
- Okay, you need to give me some
        breathing room.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.878
       I am choking here.
            - Okay.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.847
           I get it.
I'll, uh--I'll be in the kitchen

05:15.849 --> 05:17.849
      If anybody needs me.

05:23.356 --> 05:24.856
    - So what are we doing?

05:24.858 --> 05:27.359
- Well, I was thinking maybe we
      could watch a movie?

05:27.361 --> 05:28.794
   My mom has a collection of
        black and white

05:28.796 --> 05:31.630
   British garden comedies of
    manners from the 1930s.

05:31.632 --> 05:33.031
    Those are always a hoot.

05:33.033 --> 05:35.634
 - That's what you have planned
          for tonight?

05:35.636 --> 05:39.705
- Well, you said you didn't want
 to do anything special, so...

05:39.707 --> 05:43.542
          - Whatever.
    I don't care what we do.

05:43.544 --> 05:46.011
  - You know, I'm sensing some
        angry-type vibes

05:46.013 --> 05:47.979
        Coming from you.
  Are you mad about something?

05:47.981 --> 05:49.581
            - Nope.

05:49.583 --> 05:52.484
    - Well, good, because--
 - could you just stop talking?

05:52.486 --> 05:55.921
Your voice is making me want to
       tear my ears out.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.090

Well, I'll have what the lovely

     That's what you want?
        - That sure is.

06:21.482 --> 06:22.748
   It's my favorite beverage.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.782
            - Is it?
           - Mm-hmm.

There are a lot of good-looking
      girls here tonight,

06:54.882 --> 06:58.049
 And I for one am ready to get
       my "sad cupid" on.

06:58.051 --> 07:01.153
 - You know, will, I find "sad
cupid" to be a little immature.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.655
- Immature? You have a dog named
         mr. Crapsalot.

07:03.657 --> 07:06.625
  -<i> Sir</i> crapsalot, and there's
    been a change of plans.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.692
            - What?
 - There's someone very special

07:07.694 --> 07:08.760
      I want you to meet.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.961
  - Bonjour, bonjour, bonjour.

            - Hello.
     - Will, this is chloe.

07:12.132 --> 07:15.200
 She is from France, and I met
   her on the way over here.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.736
 [whispers] and I'm pretty sure
         she's the one.

07:20.139 --> 07:21.940
     - How's that appletini
          going down?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.074
      - It's going great.
            - Yeah?

07:23.076 --> 07:24.543
       - Thank you, yeah.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.514
      Give me another one.
       Make it a double.

07:29.516 --> 07:30.715
         - You got it.
     - More cherries, too.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.716
           - Uh-huh.

07:35.022 --> 07:37.189
   - What are you doing, man?

07:37.191 --> 07:40.625
  - I am feeling feelings that
I have never felt before, will.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.695
I mean, I know that we just met.
   This girl understands me.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.063
     Or that could just be
     the language barrier.

07:45.065 --> 07:48.800
- I'm really happy for you, bud,
but we had our whole "sad cupid"

07:48.802 --> 07:50.469
        Thing going on.
   Now you're all coupled up.

07:50.471 --> 07:51.837
   What am I supposed to do?

07:51.839 --> 07:53.772
      - Well, I'm so sorry
        that happy cupid

07:53.774 --> 07:55.740
 Has bit me in the ass so hard.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.043
     - I've seen this whole
       "feelings" thing,

07:58.045 --> 07:59.845
          And there is
     no turning back, man.

07:59.912 --> 08:03.915
Before you know it, you're gonna
  have a house, a kid, a dog.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.984
    - Do you think she would
       get a dog with me?

08:05.986 --> 08:07.686
        Lady crapsalot?

08:07.688 --> 08:11.756
 - Look, just do one sad cupid,
      and then you can go.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.892
   - One round of sad cupid.

08:13.894 --> 08:14.893
              One.
          - Right now.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.862
            - Okay.
           - Get sad.

08:18.197 --> 08:19.631
       Little bit sadder.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.765
     Okay, that's too much.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.802
Hey, can I get a water, please?
            Thanks.

08:23.804 --> 08:27.038
      Sorry to interrupt.
   I just feel like this is--

08:27.040 --> 08:28.874
This is such a weird night to be
         out, you know?

08:28.876 --> 08:31.943
 I was supposed to stay in, but
then I gotta cheer my buddy up.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.778
         I don't know.
          - How come?

08:33.780 --> 08:35.246
       - Oh, well, uh...

08:35.249 --> 08:37.716
 He's gonna kill me for saying
          this, but...

08:37.717 --> 08:42.053
 What happened was his fiancee
just broke off their engagement,

08:42.054 --> 08:44.155
        And he's just--

08:44.157 --> 08:46.024
     Oh, god, it kills me,
       he's heartbroken.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.028
  - Whoo, on valentine's day,
          of all days.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.030
       What are the odds?
   - Yeah, what are the odds?

08:52.032 --> 08:55.600
 It's just so horrible, and uh,
   it wasn't just a breakup,

08:55.602 --> 08:58.870
       She cheated on him
       with his brother.

08:58.872 --> 09:01.039
    [whispers] twin brother.
        - That's awful.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.774
 - Maybe she just couldn't tell
          them apart.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.976
    - No, they're fraternal,
  so that's not what happened,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.645
   But thanks for your input.
            Anyway,

09:06.647 --> 09:08.313
   He's such a sensitive guy,
           you know?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.849
      He's really romantic
   and it's valentine's day,

09:10.851 --> 09:12.317
 And it's just tearing him up.

09:12.319 --> 09:13.952
 - You're a really good friend.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.922
 - Stop it, no, I'm just doing
what anyone would do, you know?

09:16.924 --> 09:18.790
Anyway, I feel like I'm bringing
        the energy down.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.092
     What are you drinking?

09:21.094 --> 09:24.229
  - Cherry cosmopolitans with
    extra sugar on the rim.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.898
  - Yes, extra sugar, and take
    extra time making them.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.233
      - Yeah, you got it.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.602
   - You know, this may seem
 a little bit forward or weird,

09:30.604 --> 09:34.205
 But maybe one of you could go
over there and just talk to him,

09:34.207 --> 09:35.707
   Maybe try to cheer him up
         a little bit?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.809
     On the way over he was
           saying how

09:37.811 --> 09:39.711
 He doesn't know if he'll ever
          love again.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.781
  Said something about closing
     his heart off forever.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.250
 - I think he changed his mind.

09:48.921 --> 09:51.323
          - Drink up!

09:51.325 --> 09:52.357
         (man in movie)
       you didn't tell me

09:52.359 --> 09:53.925
     The vicar was coming.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.660
     We're going to be the
 laughingstock of the village!

09:55.662 --> 09:58.163
       [knocking on door]
   'ello, it's me, the vicar!

09:58.165 --> 09:59.297
         [laugh track]
      - it's always nutty

09:59.299 --> 10:00.932
     When the vicar comes.

10:00.934 --> 10:04.636
         - Yeah, nutty.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.939
     - I'll be right back.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.774
   This is a disaster of epic
          proportions.

10:09.776 --> 10:10.942
        - What happened?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.777
         - I need will.
 - Oh, no, no, no--I can help.

10:12.779 --> 10:14.913
  I'm excellent in disasters.
 You know, last year I brought

10:14.915 --> 10:17.349
 Joy to a small african village
that was ravaged by dysentery--

10:17.351 --> 10:18.750
  - Okay, do I look like a guy

10:18.752 --> 10:21.152
   Who has time for fricking
          fairy tales?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.821
         - Fairy tale?
     It happened last year.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.322
            - Will?
    Will, I need your help.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.191
 Valentine's day is a disaster.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.926
  - No, I'm kind of busy right
          now, buddy.

10:27.928 --> 10:30.195
- Shea said, "don't do anything
     for valentine's day,"

10:30.197 --> 10:32.364
          So I didn't.
      But now she's here,

10:32.366 --> 10:34.199
   And she seems really mad.

10:34.201 --> 10:36.334
           - Oh, boy.
     Classic girl behavior,

10:36.336 --> 10:38.303
The old "I hate valentine's day"
            routine.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.338
      - I am so confused.
        - Just trust me,

10:40.340 --> 10:43.241
It's best to just have presents
      on you at all times.

10:43.243 --> 10:45.377
    - I don't have anything.
          I'm screwed!

10:45.379 --> 10:47.078
     - Marcus, I can help,
         if you'd like.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.380
             - Shh!
 - All right, well, you've come

10:48.382 --> 10:50.181
       To the right guy.
      Take a deep breath.

10:50.183 --> 10:51.383
    I want you to go through
        the dumbwaiter,

10:51.385 --> 10:54.119
  Up my stairs to my bedroom.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.420
           - Marcus!

10:57.056 --> 11:02.027
  - In my closet on the left,
 there are three drawers, okay?

11:02.029 --> 11:03.895
   This is my present closet.
      It's for emergencies

11:03.897 --> 11:04.996
        Just like this.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.098
  - You have a closet full of
        presents, will?

11:07.100 --> 11:10.435
   - Presents from groupies,
     presents <i> for</i> groupies,

11:10.437 --> 11:12.871
     Swag, stuff like that.
  Oh, wait, wait--hey, marcus?

11:12.873 --> 11:16.141
 Do not--I repeat--do not open
     the top drawer, okay?

11:16.143 --> 11:18.209
    Under any circumstances,
         no top drawer.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.378
 Okay, tj, no, no, no, hold on!
      Marcus, I gotta go.

11:20.380 --> 11:22.714
   - So I can take anything?
    - You know what, marcus?

11:22.716 --> 11:24.082
 I'm not sure any of this stuff
           is right.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.451
 - Do not open the top drawer!
     I could get arrested.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.852
       - Okay, bye, will.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.387
         Alligator? No.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.423
         - [muttering]

11:31.425 --> 11:32.991
          What's this?
       - Ah! Okay, then.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.959
  Let's--let's put this away.
           All right.

11:34.961 --> 11:36.995
 - We're gonna get out of here.
         - No, no, tj!

11:36.997 --> 11:40.865
- Yeah, sorry, man, but chloe is
  really tired, it's jet lag.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.034
 - That just means you're going
          to have sex.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.402
       - Bye, sad cupid.
             - Bye.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.071
   - You don't even know what
          that means.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.072
             - Yo!

11:50.843 --> 11:53.945
            - I see.

11:53.947 --> 11:55.346
         Sympathy pour.
           - Mm-hmm.

11:55.348 --> 11:59.317
 - That was, just so you know,
    not my best game, okay?

11:59.319 --> 12:03.188
  My wingman takes off--just,
 don't judge me based on that.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.857
             Okay?
        - Hey, I get it.

12:05.859 --> 12:08.827
        Come to the bar
      on valentine's day,

12:08.829 --> 12:11.329
  The easiest day of the year
  to pick up desperate women.

12:11.331 --> 12:13.732
 "maybe me and my buddy will do
       a little routine.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.500
  We call it 'sad valentine.'"

12:15.502 --> 12:17.402
         - "sad cupid,"
      thank you very much.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.404
        - Oh, excuse me.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.840
         You know what?
    I'm gonna help you out.

12:27.747 --> 12:31.516
     - What are you doing?
- Just let it happen, sad cupid.

12:41.794 --> 12:43.528
            - Whoa.
      Thank you very much.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.097
      - Whoa, whoa, whoa,
      what are you doing?

12:48.467 --> 12:50.802
- She wants me to go over there.
          - Sit down.

12:50.804 --> 12:54.305
She has guys bringing her drinks
 and coming over to hit on her

12:54.307 --> 12:56.508
           All night.
     You're gonna stay put,

12:56.510 --> 12:59.811
   And make her come to you.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.881
           Trust me.
         I know things.

13:05.851 --> 13:07.552
          - [whispers]
             what?

13:13.059 --> 13:16.194
 - Whoa, no one's ever given me
      a teddy bear before.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.096
  - I know you said you didn't
         want anything

13:18.098 --> 13:19.998
For valentine's day, but I, uh,

13:20.000 --> 13:21.399
      I wanted to get you
       something anyway.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.002
  - Kinda thought you weren't
           going to.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.004
     What should I name it?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.339
         I know. Pasty.
          - [chuckles]

13:28.341 --> 13:30.041
  - "press here for message."

13:30.043 --> 13:32.043
  - No, uh, don't play that...

13:32.045 --> 13:33.077
         Uh, right now.

13:33.079 --> 13:36.314
            I mean,
   you can save it for later.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.482
         Woman's voice:
      Hi, will, it's jade.

13:37.484 --> 13:40.852
        Happy birthday.
   I wuv you and I want you.

13:40.854 --> 13:43.021
 Can't wait to see you tonight,
          honey bear.

13:43.023 --> 13:46.357
 - You re-gifted this present.
 You just stole it from will's.

13:46.359 --> 13:48.293
      Let's see if you wuv
        having no head.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.994
      (voice running down)
      hi, will, it's jade.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.363
       Happy birthday...
       [deep so-mo voice]

13:52.365 --> 13:54.265
     - I'll be right back.

13:54.267 --> 13:57.368
      - Yeah, so in love.
    Yeah, see that? Totally.

13:57.370 --> 14:00.371
            - Yeah.
        - Okay, do them.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.240
          - All right.
      That's a first date,

14:02.242 --> 14:06.377
 And she's about to try to fake
 a phone call so she can leave.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.879
            - What?
    She's totally into him.

14:07.881 --> 14:09.547
        - No, she's not.
        She's faking it.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.316
      - You are so wrong,
     I feel sorry for you.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.418
          - All right.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.954
         - Oh, my god.
You're totally right, she just--

14:15.956 --> 14:17.355
How do you--how do you do that,
           honestly?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.557
- It's all in the body language,
           my friend.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.860
  - You're like a drunk people
          clairvoyant.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.962
  - I just spend a lot of time
        watching people

14:23.964 --> 14:25.964
      Hit on other people.
    It becomes pretty clear.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.565
      - That's incredible.
       That's incredible.

14:27.567 --> 14:30.501
 You should get a reality show
         or something.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.136
  Must make you kind of jaded,
            though.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.638
         - Oh, totally.
         But, you know,

14:33.640 --> 14:36.374
Sometimes people turn out to be
    better than you thought.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.110
- Sometimes they do, don't they?

14:42.381 --> 14:45.250
    - I have a 12-year-old.

14:45.252 --> 14:47.118
         And two jobs.
       All of that while

14:47.120 --> 14:50.288
  Trying to finish my college
     degree, so, trust me.

14:50.290 --> 14:51.522
     You're not interested.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.959
   - I'm just having a drink
         at a bar here.

14:56.495 --> 14:58.496
             - Hey.
     Thanks for that drink.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.366
           I'm katie.
     - Hi, yeah, I'm will.

15:01.368 --> 15:02.600
     Yeah, you're welcome.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.669
    - I kind of kept waiting
     for you to come over.

15:04.671 --> 15:07.505
    I'm actually heading out

 - They hold them at that club
         once a month.

15:29.963 --> 15:32.630
   It's like a regular party,
  but you can't get in unless

     - Don't mess with me.
