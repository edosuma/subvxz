WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:03.751
(snoring)

00:03.961 --> 00:07.251
(whimsical instrumental music)

00:07.466 --> 00:09.924
No, it can't be.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.172
It isn't true.

00:13.138 --> 00:16.302
<i>Um, Twilight?
(banging on the door)</i>

00:16.517 --> 00:17.177
<i>Twilight!</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:20.510
<i>The bus for Camp Evergreen
leaves in 10 minutes!</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:22.311
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.435
I can't believe I overslept.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.312
Me neither, that's not like you.

00:28.946 --> 00:29.946
I know.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.771
Don't you have a super
annoying alarm clock

00:31.990 --> 00:34.824
that goes (mimics
alarm clock buzzer).

00:35.035 --> 00:37.743
(alarm clock buzzes)

00:37.955 --> 00:38.991
It's gonna be fine.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.868
We'll help you pack.

00:42.167 --> 00:43.908
(panting)

00:44.628 --> 00:46.745
(groans) We're gonna
be out in the woods.

00:46.964 --> 00:48.045
When's she gonna need that?

00:48.257 --> 00:49.589
If we were going to the moon

00:49.841 --> 00:51.833
I'd insist she packed
an evening gown.

00:52.052 --> 00:54.669
One never knows, darling.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.971
Let me just get changed.

00:59.851 --> 01:03.015
(dark sinister music)

01:03.855 --> 01:05.892
Midnight Sparkle!

01:06.108 --> 01:07.440
How is this possible?

01:07.651 --> 01:10.109
Sunset Shimmer helped me defeat
you at the Friendship Games.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.404
You and your friends
can never truly defeat me.

01:13.615 --> 01:15.948
(laughs manically)

01:16.159 --> 01:18.446
(screaming)

01:22.749 --> 01:24.911
Midnight Sparkle's
a part of you.

01:26.878 --> 01:28.289
I'll always be there

01:28.505 --> 01:31.543
waiting in the darkest
shadows of your mind.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.841
I'll be back, Twilight!

01:34.052 --> 01:38.046
And this time I won't stop
until I have all the magic.

01:38.265 --> 01:39.756
No, stop!

01:39.975 --> 01:41.841
Twilight, wake up.

01:42.060 --> 01:43.596
We can't stop, silly.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.269
We're not there yet.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.022
Hey, are you okay?

01:49.151 --> 01:50.151
I'm fine.

01:51.987 --> 01:53.398
We are gonna have so much fun.

01:53.614 --> 01:55.697
We're gonna roast marshmallows
and eat marshmallows

01:55.907 --> 01:58.399
and sleep on
marshmallow pillows!

01:58.619 --> 02:00.531
Yeah, probably
not gonna do that.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.112
Maybe you're not.

02:03.415 --> 02:04.826
<i>Attention, students.</i>

02:05.042 --> 02:07.659
We're almost there,
but before we arrive

02:07.878 --> 02:10.120
we just wanted to say
how proud we are of you

02:10.339 --> 02:13.707
for raising enough money to
go on this class field trip.

02:13.925 --> 02:14.540
When we were your age,

02:14.760 --> 02:16.877
we made some of our favorite
memories in these woods

02:17.304 --> 02:19.261
and we're sure you will too.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.511
Now who's excited
for Camp Everfree?

02:22.726 --> 02:24.934
(cheering)

02:29.691 --> 02:32.775

Isn't Camp Everfree
just beautiful?

04:46.912 --> 04:49.700
I can't wait until we have
our first nature walk.

04:49.915 --> 04:51.827
I definitely wanna
go on one of those.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.705
You wanna see all the adorable
woodland creatures, too?

04:54.920 --> 04:57.128
Yeah, specifically squirrels.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.501
More specifically,
so I can chase 'em!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.503
(barking and panting)

05:01.718 --> 05:03.459
I'm just lookin'
forward to roughin' it.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.920
I'm gonna make my own
shelter, forage for food...

05:06.139 --> 05:09.382
Uh, you know they provide
us with food and tents, right?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.763
Yup! Still gonna
forage though.

05:11.978 --> 05:14.140
(sigh) I'm just
after some R and R.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.144
The past year has all been a
bit too much for my tastes.

05:17.359 --> 05:18.065
I'll say!

05:18.276 --> 05:19.562
We fought three evil sirens

05:19.778 --> 05:21.255
who tried to hypnotize
everybody with their singing,

05:21.279 --> 05:23.191
one ridiculously
competitive rival school,

05:23.406 --> 05:25.068
and two demon friends!

05:26.535 --> 05:28.197
Uh, (giggles) no offense.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.743
None taken.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.742
You'll get used to it.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.621
Yup, Canterlot High has
become a regular magic magnet.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.188
Gonna be nice gettin'
away to a place

05:37.212 --> 05:39.750
where we don't have to worry
about that kinda stuff.

05:39.965 --> 05:41.126
Here you go, Twilight.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.628
Thanks, it's Flash, right?

05:43.844 --> 05:44.960
Yup, that's me!

05:45.178 --> 05:46.214
And you're you.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.887
And we don't know
each other very well.

05:49.099 --> 05:50.215
Cool story, bro.

05:50.433 --> 05:51.173
Right.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.680
I guess I'll see you around.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.291
You know how there's that
girl who looks just like you

05:57.315 --> 05:59.115
when she's here but lives
in another dimension

05:59.276 --> 06:00.733
and she's a pony princess?

06:00.944 --> 06:01.980
Uh-huh.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.312
Flash kinda had a thing for her.

06:04.531 --> 06:05.191
Oh.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.238
(microphone feedback)

06:06.491 --> 06:08.198
<i>Hi, everyone!</i>

06:08.410 --> 06:10.402
<i>If you could start
heading to the courtyard,</i>

06:10.620 --> 06:11.986
<i>that would be rad!</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:15.789
<i>It's time to start the
best week of camp ever!</i>

06:16.001 --> 06:18.994
(campers conversing)

06:19.212 --> 06:19.918
Hi, everyone!

06:20.130 --> 06:21.587
Welcome to Camp Everfree!

06:21.798 --> 06:24.085
I'm Gloriosa Daisy,
your camp director.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.759
Think of me as your friendly
camp and nature guide

06:26.970 --> 06:29.257
and this is my
brother, Timber Spruce.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.008
Think of me as that awesome guy

06:31.224 --> 06:33.557
who should always be
invited to fun things.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.884
We aim to please,

06:35.103 --> 06:36.844
so before we hand out
our tent assignments,

06:37.063 --> 06:38.725
we'd like to hear
from all of you.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.728
You're free to do
whatever you like here.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.900
Uh, except hike
near the rock quarry,

06:44.112 --> 06:45.728
that's off limits.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.781
Yes, but otherwise, your
options are wide open.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.699
So what activities
will make this

06:50.911 --> 06:53.699
the very best week
of your lives ever?

06:53.914 --> 06:55.075
- Rock climbing!
- Done!

06:55.290 --> 06:56.781
- Archery!
- Of course!

06:57.000 --> 06:59.333
- Tetherball!
- Naturally!

06:59.544 --> 07:00.785
Rainbow, I know you're excited

07:01.004 --> 07:04.293
but maybe give somebody else
a chance to make a suggestion.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.089
Arts and crafts!

07:06.301 --> 07:08.714
My mom needs new pot holders.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.716
<i>I'll supply the looms.</i>

07:10.931 --> 07:12.718
Cookie decorating! (slurps)

07:12.933 --> 07:15.516
Ooh, I do make a
mean sugar cookie.

07:15.727 --> 07:17.593
Early morning nature walks?

07:17.812 --> 07:20.020
With walking
sticks for everyone!

07:20.231 --> 07:20.846
<i>Oh, me!</i>

07:21.066 --> 07:23.308
Oh, uh, a fashion show

07:23.526 --> 07:25.688
where I design the most
fabulous camp looks

07:25.904 --> 07:27.566
inspired by today's
hottest trends

07:27.781 --> 07:30.273
and have them modeled
by my classmates

07:30.492 --> 07:32.358
in a gorgeous outdoor setting!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.318
A camp tradition!

07:35.038 --> 07:37.655
We have literally
never done that.

07:37.874 --> 07:40.241
I'll be taking requests the
rest of the time you're here

07:40.460 --> 07:42.167
so if there's anything
you'd like to do,

07:42.379 --> 07:44.587
<i>anything you need, just ask.</i>

07:44.798 --> 07:46.505
But what about the camp gift?

07:46.716 --> 07:49.629
That was my favorite
Camp Everfree tradition.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.836
The camp gift, of course!

07:52.055 --> 07:54.047
- Really?
- Yes, really.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.346
Well, I just thought...

07:55.558 --> 07:56.674
Then you thought wrong!

07:56.893 --> 07:58.930
Anyone else picking
up on a little tension

07:59.145 --> 08:00.511
between Gloriosa
and her brother?

08:00.730 --> 08:01.730
[Both] Uh...

08:01.898 --> 08:02.979
Little.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.148
Every year,
campers work together

08:05.360 --> 08:06.646
to create something useful.

08:06.861 --> 08:08.853
<i>A gift for future campers.</i>

08:09.072 --> 08:10.904
<i>Working toward this common goal</i>

08:11.116 --> 08:13.233
<i>is key to forming
the strong bonds</i>

08:13.451 --> 08:16.364
<i>that will last well beyond
your time here at camp.</i>

08:16.746 --> 08:19.113
Which is why it's so important.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.619
This gazebo was a gift
from last year's group.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.168
<i>Oh, oh, oh, and the totem
pole and the sundial</i>

08:24.379 --> 08:25.790
<i>were also made by campers!</i>

08:26.006 --> 08:28.248
The sundial was our year's gift!

08:28.466 --> 08:30.879
(Coughing) Even
though some people

08:31.094 --> 08:32.585
thought it was a
little impractical

08:32.804 --> 08:35.261
since the sundial
can't be used at night.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.886
(chuckles) You all seem
like a really amazing group

08:39.102 --> 08:40.822
so I'm certain you'll
come up with something

08:40.937 --> 08:42.929
inspiring to leave behind.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.889
(campers cheering)

08:45.108 --> 08:46.519
Speaking of leaving
things behind,

08:46.735 --> 08:49.227
now's the time when we
give out tent assignments

08:49.446 --> 08:51.654
so you can leave your
heavy bags behind.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.196
Girls will be getting their
assignments from Timber.

08:56.411 --> 08:57.993
Guys, you're with me.

08:59.664 --> 09:00.664
Oh, boy!

09:03.001 --> 09:05.664
Yay! I'm in the emerald tent!

09:05.879 --> 09:07.586
Woo, me, too!

09:07.797 --> 09:09.880
- Aquamarine.
- Me, too!

09:10.091 --> 09:11.127
- Woo-hoo!
- Oh, yeah!

09:11.342 --> 09:12.708
I got Amethyst.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.295
- Sapphire.
- Me, too!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.130
I mean, I'm assuming I am.

09:18.349 --> 09:20.557
Technically, sapphires
aren't just blue.

09:20.769 --> 09:23.432
They can be pink,
purple, yellow...

09:23.646 --> 09:25.057
Yeah, but they're mostly blue

09:25.273 --> 09:28.061
that's why they're named after
the Latin word, sapphires.

09:30.361 --> 09:31.568
That means, "blue".

09:31.780 --> 09:32.520
I know. (giggles)

09:32.739 --> 09:34.196
But did you know that sapphires

09:34.407 --> 09:36.069
are just rubies
without chromium?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.284
No.

09:38.536 --> 09:41.574
But did you know that
sapphire tent is the best one?

09:41.790 --> 09:43.452
No, why's that?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.953
Because you're in it.

09:46.169 --> 09:48.912
Oh, I bet you say
that to all the campers.

09:49.130 --> 09:50.166
Not true.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.792
You're in the Ruby Tent?

09:52.008 --> 09:53.670
Ha, that's the worst one!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.421
Ah, man!

09:56.304 --> 09:57.715
I'm just jokin', buddy.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.138
Ruby tent is great.

09:59.349 --> 10:02.513
It's like a sapphire,
but with chromium.

10:03.812 --> 10:04.893
(giggling)

10:05.105 --> 10:06.123
But the ruby and coral tents

10:06.147 --> 10:08.184
do look an awful lot alike
to the undiscerning eye.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.891
I better show you where it is.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.318
See you around.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.897
- (giggling)
- What?

10:17.117 --> 10:18.574
Heh, nothin'.

10:18.785 --> 10:21.994
Ooh, that was adorable!

10:22.288 --> 10:23.324
(whistle blows)

10:23.540 --> 10:25.577
Okay, everyone,
go get settled in.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.533
We'll be meeting at
the docks in 15 minutes

10:27.752 --> 10:30.290
to go over some
camp safety rules.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.246
Let me know if
you need anything!

10:32.465 --> 10:34.502
(dark instrumental music)

10:34.717 --> 10:37.004
I need somethin'.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.213
Filthy Rich, so nice to see you.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.592
What are you doing here?

10:41.808 --> 10:43.219
Camp is just getting started.

10:43.434 --> 10:47.144
Just takin' in the
scenery, Gloriosa Daisy.

10:47.355 --> 10:51.065
It's so (chuckles) relaxing.

10:52.235 --> 10:54.443
Well, you can look
around when camp is over!

10:54.654 --> 10:56.486
Now, if you don't mind.

11:00.952 --> 11:01.952
Fine.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.491
(limo drives away)

11:05.707 --> 11:08.745
Filthy Rich is, uh,
an alumni of the camp.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.872
He likes to check on
his old stomping grounds

11:11.087 --> 11:12.828
every now and again.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.163
But enough about him.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.998
Find your tents and
put away your things.

11:16.217 --> 11:19.881
We've got the best week
of camp ever to begin!

11:21.472 --> 11:24.636
(birds chirping)

11:24.851 --> 11:27.138
(sigh) I'm all for
learning safety rules

11:27.353 --> 11:29.185
but I do hope I can get
started on my designs

11:29.397 --> 11:32.515
for the camp fashion show
sooner rather than later.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.771
Huh, I still can't
believe you talked Gloriosa

11:34.986 --> 11:36.568
into havin' a fashion show.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.987
We're in the middle of the
woods for cryin' out loud!

11:39.199 --> 11:40.565
We're s'posed to be roughin' it!

11:40.783 --> 11:42.775
It's clear from
Gloriosa's own wardrobe

11:42.994 --> 11:45.452
that she appreciates a
well put together look.

11:45.663 --> 11:48.326
Even if we are in the
middle of the woods.

11:48.541 --> 11:49.577
Fair enough.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.103
Just as long as you
don't put me in one

11:51.127 --> 11:53.210
of your fancy pants outfits.

11:54.339 --> 11:56.581
- You're gonna, aren't ya?
- No.

11:56.799 --> 11:57.799
Yes! (giggles)

11:58.009 --> 11:59.750
Don't worry, it will
absolutely speak

11:59.969 --> 12:01.301
<i>to your personal
sense of fashion.</i>

12:01.512 --> 12:04.425
(spooky music, imitates ghost)

12:04.641 --> 12:06.052
That was weird
back there, right?

12:06.267 --> 12:08.475
With that guy, Filthy Rich?

12:08.686 --> 12:11.269
Huh? Oh, I guess so.

12:11.773 --> 12:15.232
I just have this feeling that
Gloriosa's hiding something.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.605
Her brother is pretty
cute though, huh?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.271
He's okay.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.358
Ooh, now look who's
trying to hide something.

12:23.576 --> 12:24.612
No, I'm not!

12:25.703 --> 12:27.285
Hey, you okay?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.497
You seemed a little freaked
out on the bus earlier.

12:29.666 --> 12:32.204
Probably had another
one of her nightmares.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.418
I'm fine.

12:33.628 --> 12:35.620
I mean, what do I have
to complain about?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.295
Ever since I transferred here,

12:37.507 --> 12:40.124
everyone from CHS has been
really nice and accepting.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.834
Especially considering
what happened

12:42.053 --> 12:43.635
at the Friendship Games.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.212
That wasn't your fault.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.191
Principal Cinch is the
one who encouraged you

12:47.392 --> 12:48.552
to try and use all that magic

12:48.601 --> 12:50.388
to win the games
for Crystal Prep.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.936
You weren't ready to
have that kind of power

12:53.147 --> 12:54.604
but it's over now.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.585
And if there's any group
that's gonna forgive you

12:56.609 --> 12:58.169
for something that
happened in the past,

12:58.319 --> 13:00.356
trust me, it's this one.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.857
You guys comin' or what?

13:02.073 --> 13:03.780
Be right there!

13:03.992 --> 13:05.984
I just wanna put
on some sunscreen.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.159
Huh, I coulda sworn I packed it.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.372
Found it!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.283
(mystical music)

13:19.340 --> 13:20.456
Did you?

13:20.675 --> 13:22.211
How is this possible?

13:22.427 --> 13:23.427
I can't believe this.

13:23.594 --> 13:24.334
It's...

13:24.554 --> 13:27.262
- terrible.
- Amazing!

13:27.473 --> 13:28.473
Are you kidding?

13:28.599 --> 13:29.680
This is great!

13:29.892 --> 13:31.252
I mean, we've all
ponied up before.

13:31.394 --> 13:33.556
Gotten the whole ears
and wings and tail thing.

13:33.771 --> 13:35.012
Shot magical rainbow lasers.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.644
But nothing like this
has ever happened.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.100
How did you do it?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.685
I don't know.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.064
Maybe I didn't.

13:42.280 --> 13:43.612
Maybe it's her.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.823
Her, who?

13:44.949 --> 13:46.065
Nothing, never mind.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.367
Can we just not talk about it?

13:48.578 --> 13:50.240
And could you please
not bring this whole

13:50.455 --> 13:52.242
levitating thing
up to the others?

13:52.707 --> 13:53.493
Why not?

13:53.708 --> 13:54.414
You heard Applejack.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.825
This is supposed to be a place

13:55.918 --> 13:57.750
where everyone can
get away from magic.

13:57.962 --> 13:59.356
<i>I don't want them to
know I brought some</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:01.246
crazy, new kind with me.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.706
If you really don't want me to,

14:02.842 --> 14:04.378
I won't say anything.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.794
I really don't.

14:07.013 --> 14:11.007
Okay but this isn't
necessarily a bad thing.

14:11.225 --> 14:14.593
(suspenseful orchestral music)

14:14.812 --> 14:15.812
(sigh)

14:16.022 --> 14:17.979
(suspenseful orchestral music)

14:18.191 --> 14:19.191
(sigh)

14:19.233 --> 14:21.520
I think you're just
gonna have to pick it up.

14:22.028 --> 14:23.144
(groans)

14:28.159 --> 14:29.320
<i>Don't act like that!</i>

14:29.535 --> 14:30.867
What did you say?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.321
I didn't say anything.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.655
Just here to make sure

14:34.874 --> 14:36.957
everyone was headed
over to the docks.

14:37.168 --> 14:38.329
Did you need something?

14:38.544 --> 14:39.544
Nope.

14:39.670 --> 14:41.110
Because if there
is anything I can do

14:41.214 --> 14:42.955
to make this week
the best week ever,

14:43.174 --> 14:44.460
you just let me know.

14:44.675 --> 14:45.791
I've got this!

14:46.010 --> 14:47.592
Thanks, I'm good.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.056
People that chipper
make me nervous.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.725
This is gonna be so much fun!

14:55.937 --> 14:57.769
I guess not all people.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.476
<i>(sigh) It's beautiful, isn't it?</i>

15:00.691 --> 15:03.434
<i>It looks like a diamond
shining in the sun.</i>

15:03.653 --> 15:05.110
It is lovely out here.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.278
The fresh air, the cool breeze.

15:07.490 --> 15:08.571
(bird chirping)

15:08.783 --> 15:10.615
The birds that land
on your finger.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.035
I think that only
happens to you.

15:13.246 --> 15:16.114
Lake activities are
available everyday until sunset

15:16.332 --> 15:19.825
so if you want to canoe,
sail, windsurf, or swim

15:20.044 --> 15:21.501
just let me know.

15:23.464 --> 15:25.046
(ducks quacking)

15:25.258 --> 15:27.625
Aren't they just the cutest?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.585
(shouts)

15:29.804 --> 15:30.804
Whoa.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.588
I know I'm charming but

15:32.807 --> 15:35.265
you don't have to fall for me.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.185
(sigh)

15:42.400 --> 15:44.483
Guess I can't get
too jealous, right?

15:44.694 --> 15:46.856
After all, she
isn't my Twilight.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.108
Not that the other
Twilight was mine.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.906
But we were, you know.

15:52.118 --> 15:53.859
Yeah, I get it.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.445
But your Twilight is a
princess in Equestria.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.825
Hate to break it to ya but,

15:58.040 --> 16:00.077
that's where she's gonna
spend most of her time.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.660
So you're saying I just
need to get over her?

16:02.879 --> 16:04.165
Kinda, yeah.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.086
Ouch!

16:05.298 --> 16:06.709
You're not pulling any punches.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.290
Not really my style.

16:08.509 --> 16:09.509
Sorry.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.506
This is a safety hazard.

16:11.721 --> 16:13.001
I suggest we close down the dock

16:13.139 --> 16:14.505
for the remainder of the camp.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.465
(campers complain)

16:16.684 --> 16:18.016
Oh, I'm sure it won't have to be

16:18.227 --> 16:19.593
for the remainder of camp.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.849
It just needs to be
patched up a bit.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.180
I've got this!

16:24.108 --> 16:26.896
Huh, or maybe we do.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.398
If you ask me, this
whole dock needs to go.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.614
(thump)

16:30.823 --> 16:32.940
Building a new one
could be our camp gift.

16:33.159 --> 16:34.320
Sure, it would benefit us

16:34.535 --> 16:37.369
<i>but a nice new dock would
benefit future campers, too.</i>

16:37.580 --> 16:38.240
I don't know.

16:38.456 --> 16:39.572
It's an awful lot of work.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.185
I wouldn't want you
guys to miss out on

16:41.209 --> 16:43.542
doing other fun camp stuff
because you're so busy

16:43.753 --> 16:46.040
building a dock
for future campers.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.878
I hear what you're
saying, Timber,

16:50.092 --> 16:51.958
but we're Canterlot Wonderbolts.

16:52.178 --> 16:54.295
We've got a reputation to uphold

16:54.514 --> 16:56.450
and there was no way we
were gonna leave this place

16:56.474 --> 16:59.467
without contributing the
most awesome camp gift ever!

16:59.685 --> 17:00.685
I'm with AJ.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.890
Building a new dock
is definitely it!

17:03.105 --> 17:04.141
What do you guys think?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.565
(campers cheer)

17:06.776 --> 17:09.143
Looks like it's settled then.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.978
Looks like it.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.106
That's some tension, all right.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.569
We can reinforce the foundation.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.030
Make it nice and sturdy.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.529
And we can add
a wood carved sign

17:22.625 --> 17:23.786
that says, Camp Everfree.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.082
And little boxes of food

17:25.294 --> 17:27.580
so you can feed the
ducks and fishies.

17:27.797 --> 17:30.289
Oh, we'll add lanterns
so you can see at night.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.422
(gasps) It's stunning!

17:35.638 --> 17:37.971
And will make an
absolutely perfect runway

17:38.182 --> 17:39.798
for my camp fashion show.

17:40.017 --> 17:41.349
More importantly,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.161
it'll be a great place
for dockin' canoes

17:43.354 --> 17:44.765
and feeding the wildlife.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.348
You say tomato, I say
perfect place to showcase

17:47.567 --> 17:50.150
glamorous Boho-chic stylings.

17:50.361 --> 17:51.522
What do you guys think?

17:51.737 --> 17:54.821
It's going to be a lot
of work but we can do it!

17:55.032 --> 17:57.820
Yeah, adult supervision!

18:01.122 --> 18:03.034
Huh, nice hammer.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.956
Where'd you get it?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.454
Uh, duh, the toolbox.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.036
Huh, that's cool.

18:09.255 --> 18:10.871
I made mine.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.090
(groans)

18:15.177 --> 18:18.591
Making lanterns out of
solar powered garden lights.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.638
Pretty crafty there, Timber.

18:20.850 --> 18:22.307
You think that's crafty?

18:22.518 --> 18:24.009
You should see my macaroni art.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.720
I'm like the Picasso of noodles.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.521
(giggling)

18:28.733 --> 18:31.396
All right now, you've
made a lot of progress

18:31.611 --> 18:33.147
but it's going to be
getting dark soon.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.482
We can pick this up tomorrow

18:34.697 --> 18:36.359
between our other
camp activities.

18:36.574 --> 18:37.940
Everyone get cleaned up

18:38.159 --> 18:39.759
and we'll gather by
the fire pit at eight

18:39.869 --> 18:42.577
to share s'mores
and scary stories!

18:42.788 --> 18:43.788
S'mores!

18:45.458 --> 18:48.792
And that's when she looked down

18:49.295 --> 18:51.252
and realized she was wearing

18:51.464 --> 18:56.710
purple socks with a
burgundy dress! (screams)

18:59.889 --> 19:01.881
Purple and burgundy, darlings.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.934
The same color family.
(screams dramatically)

19:08.814 --> 19:12.023
Uh, that was a terrifying story.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.356
Yeah, I'm terrified
she'll try to tell it again.

19:15.571 --> 19:18.985
(clears throat) Anyone
else have a spooky story?

19:19.867 --> 19:21.153
<i>I have one.</i>

19:21.369 --> 19:22.780
But I'm warning you,

19:22.995 --> 19:25.032
you might as well
hug a friend now.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.785
That's how scary it is.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.786
(gasps) Oh, dear.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.958
(teeth chattering)

19:31.545 --> 19:34.253
It's time I told
you about the legend

19:34.465 --> 19:36.081
of Gaia Everfree!

19:36.300 --> 19:38.838
(spooky music)

19:41.055 --> 19:43.638
<i>- Many years ago,
- (chop)</i>

19:43.849 --> 19:47.183
<i>my great grandparents
came to this forest.</i>

19:47.395 --> 19:48.602
<i>Seeing it's beauty,</i>

19:48.813 --> 19:52.898
<i>they decided that it would be
the perfect place for a camp.</i>

19:53.776 --> 19:55.813
<i>But once they started building</i>

19:56.028 --> 19:58.771
<i>strange things
started to happen.</i>

20:00.908 --> 20:03.400
<i>One pitch black night,</i>

20:03.619 --> 20:05.235
<i>when the wind was howling,</i>

20:05.454 --> 20:07.912
<i>a tree branch thrashed through
the roof of their cabin.</i>

20:08.124 --> 20:09.786
<i>They screamed and ran outside</i>

20:10.000 --> 20:12.913
<i>only to see a giant creature
rising from the earth.</i>

20:13.129 --> 20:15.621
<i>She had wild hair like
the roots of a tree.</i>

20:15.840 --> 20:17.672
<i>He mouth had jagged rock teeth</i>

20:17.883 --> 20:20.546
<i>and her eyes were
pools of black tar.</i>

20:20.761 --> 20:22.753
<i>But her aura shimmered
like diamonds.</i>

20:22.930 --> 20:26.924
<i>Anywhere she went, she left a
trail of gem dust in her wake.</i>

20:27.143 --> 20:29.385
<i>Trembling, my great
grandparents asked</i>

20:29.603 --> 20:31.560
<i>who she was and what she wanted.</i>

20:31.772 --> 20:34.515
<i>In a deep and hallow
voice she told them</i>

20:34.734 --> 20:36.600
<i>that her name was Gaia Everfree,</i>

20:36.819 --> 20:39.653
<i>an ancient spirit who held
domain over the forest</i>

20:39.864 --> 20:41.105
<i>and that my great grandparents</i>

20:41.323 --> 20:43.565
<i>were trespassing on her land.</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:45.846
<i>They begged her to let them
stay and build their camp</i>

20:45.870 --> 20:48.613
<i>to share this wonderful
place with others.</i>

20:48.831 --> 20:51.619
<i>Gaia Everfree finally
agreed but warned them</i>

20:51.834 --> 20:54.042
<i>that they would not be
able to keep it forever.</i>

20:54.253 --> 20:58.338
<i>Someday she would return and
reclaim the forest as her own.</i>

20:59.884 --> 21:02.342
So if you see a
trail of gem dust,

21:02.553 --> 21:04.761
you'll know that it is,

21:04.972 --> 21:06.713
Gaia Everfree!

21:06.932 --> 21:09.345
(screaming)

21:09.560 --> 21:10.560
Hey, guys.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.806
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.059
Then why'd you come
out of the bushes?

21:15.274 --> 21:17.266
I took the scenic route because

21:17.485 --> 21:20.068
the forest is
beautiful at night.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.564
But no one else should do
it without a guide, okay?

21:23.783 --> 21:27.276
All right, everybody, time
to head to your tents.

21:27.495 --> 21:30.579
Hey, Gloriosa, do you
have extra toothbrushes?

21:30.790 --> 21:31.790
I forgot mine.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.701
Sure do, I'll get one for you.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.832
I'm scared of the dark.

21:38.047 --> 21:39.879
Do you have flashlights?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.508
Of course, I got this!

21:43.969 --> 21:47.758
(grunting) Fluttershy.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.089
Sorry, Spike.

21:49.308 --> 21:51.846
I guess that story got to me.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.718
Why? It can't be real.

21:53.938 --> 21:55.179
I don't know.

21:55.397 --> 21:56.888
Gaia Everfree could
be some creature

21:57.107 --> 21:58.848
that got booted from Equestria

21:59.068 --> 22:00.525
and ended up in this world.

22:00.736 --> 22:02.819
That's what happened
with the Sirens.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.817
Uh, sounded more like
something that Timber

22:05.032 --> 22:07.570
was making up just to scare us.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.401
At least, I hope it was.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.380
Last thing that I want
is to have camp ruined

22:11.497 --> 22:13.910
by some power-crazed
magical creature.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.331
Oh, hear, hear.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.876
We've had to deal with more
than our fair share of those.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.579
At the Fall Formal,
our musical showcase,

22:20.798 --> 22:22.960
the Friendship Ga... (stammers)

22:23.175 --> 22:24.211
I mean, you know.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.106
Everything turned out
all right, of course.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.547
(giggles nervously)

22:27.763 --> 22:29.504
I'm kinda tired.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.964
I'm gonna turn in.

22:32.059 --> 22:33.537
Maybe lay off bringing
up what happened

22:33.561 --> 22:35.052
at the Friendship Games.

22:35.271 --> 22:37.228
I think she's still
pretty sensitive about it.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.891
Our lips are sealed.

22:42.903 --> 22:45.270
(birds chirping)

22:45.489 --> 22:47.572
(snoring)

22:50.035 --> 22:51.035
<i>Here I am.</i>

22:54.081 --> 22:55.413
<i>Over here.</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:58.708
(dark sinister music)

22:59.044 --> 22:59.704
(fire explodes)

22:59.920 --> 23:01.001
I'm always here!

23:01.213 --> 23:02.213
No!

23:02.923 --> 23:04.255
What happened?

23:04.466 --> 23:05.466
Nothing.

23:05.509 --> 23:06.625
Sorry, Sunset.

23:09.138 --> 23:12.882
Uh, Twilight, I think
something happened.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.594
(screams)

23:14.810 --> 23:16.597
(yelp)

23:16.812 --> 23:20.476
(sigh) Is it time
to get up already?

23:21.609 --> 23:24.568
Twilight, we really
have to talk about this.

23:24.778 --> 23:26.360
No, we don't.

23:29.158 --> 23:32.117
(light guitar music)

23:34.997 --> 23:36.329
(bird squawks)

23:39.960 --> 23:41.747
Hey, I know you don't want to

23:41.962 --> 23:43.624
but I really think
we need to figure out

23:43.839 --> 23:45.626
what's going on with your magic.

23:45.841 --> 23:47.201
If you could learn
to control it...

23:47.301 --> 23:48.337
But that's just it,

23:48.552 --> 23:50.339
I'll never be able
to control it!

23:50.554 --> 23:52.420
(crash)

23:54.642 --> 23:56.224
What happened?

23:56.435 --> 23:57.846
I didn't mean to.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.062
We didn't see anything

23:59.229 --> 24:01.642
so we don't know what happened.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.309
Are you okay?

24:05.527 --> 24:07.894
Yeah, it was so weird.

24:08.113 --> 24:11.527
We were stuck in the middle
of the lake with no wind

24:11.742 --> 24:13.950
then all of a sudden, bam!

24:14.161 --> 24:17.871
The wind picked up and we were
pushed right into the dock.

24:18.082 --> 24:21.621
(gasp) You don't think
it was the spirit, do you?

24:21.835 --> 24:23.952
No, it was me.

24:24.922 --> 24:27.960
Spirit, show yourself.

24:28.175 --> 24:32.010
The great and powerful
Trixie commands it!

24:32.221 --> 24:33.462
<i>What's that?</i>

24:33.681 --> 24:34.762
Is that crystal dust?

24:34.974 --> 24:37.057
How else can we explain it?

24:38.477 --> 24:42.221
Man, all our hard work, ruined!

24:42.731 --> 24:45.064
At least the fishies
are eating well.

24:45.275 --> 24:46.955
Let's salvage what we
can out of the water.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.609
Maybe we can still fix this.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.062
We have to try!

24:50.280 --> 24:52.988
- Camp Everfree needs a runway!
- Dock.

24:53.200 --> 24:56.693
Dock, yes, that's what I meant.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.253
<i>♪ It used to be so simple</i>

25:07.464 --> 25:11.629
<i>♪ It was a world I understood</i>

25:11.844 --> 25:14.928
<i>♪ I didn't know
what I didn't know</i>

25:15.139 --> 25:18.849
<i>♪ And life seemed pretty good</i>

25:19.059 --> 25:24.396
<i>♪ But now the darkness rises</i>

25:24.606 --> 25:30.523
<i>♪ From somewhere
deep inside of me</i>

25:32.531 --> 25:37.276
<i>♪ Her power overtakes me</i>

25:37.494 --> 25:43.741
<i>♪ Can I keep this
Midnight from getting free</i>

25:43.959 --> 25:46.827
<i>♪ If I can see with the light</i>

25:47.046 --> 25:50.084
<i>♪ I know I'll be free</i>

25:50.299 --> 25:53.042
<i>♪ And I can start to be whole</i>

25:53.218 --> 25:57.007
<i>♪ I can start to be me</i>

25:57.222 --> 26:02.843
<i>♪ But instead I am struggling
with all that I see</i>

26:03.062 --> 26:06.146
<i>♪ And these friends</i>

26:06.356 --> 26:11.818
<i>♪ Mustn't see
the Midnight in me</i>

26:13.822 --> 26:17.907
<i>♪ The Midnight in me</i>

26:18.118 --> 26:22.283
<i>♪ They mustn't see
the Midnight in</i>

26:24.124 --> 26:27.288
<i>♪ Me</i>

26:34.051 --> 26:36.839
(curious music)

26:40.307 --> 26:42.014
(mumbling)

26:42.226 --> 26:44.889
So many squirrels.

26:45.104 --> 26:47.016
- Spike.
- (yelps)

26:47.231 --> 26:49.097
(sigh) Aw, man.

26:49.316 --> 26:51.228
I was having the best dream.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.902
Wait, that dream
could be a reality.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.605
Before you run off
to chase squirrels,

26:56.824 --> 26:58.941
do you have any idea
where Twilight could be?

26:59.159 --> 27:00.525
I really need to talk to her.

27:00.744 --> 27:01.951
What happened?

27:02.162 --> 27:04.443
Did she do that lifting things
off the ground thing again?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.953
That's just it, I
don't know if it was her

27:07.167 --> 27:10.080
but if it was, we need
to deal with it head on.

27:10.295 --> 27:12.036
I can track her down.

27:13.590 --> 27:15.957
Keep it together, deep breaths.

27:16.176 --> 27:17.633
You are not a monster.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.845
(shouts)

27:18.929 --> 27:20.295
Oh, hi. (giggles)

27:20.556 --> 27:22.263
What are you doing here?

27:22.474 --> 27:25.057
Uh, looking for you.

27:25.269 --> 27:27.727
Oh, I just went on a nature walk

27:27.938 --> 27:29.554
and got a little lost.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.014
Let me show you the way.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.940
I'm kind of an expert
at these woods.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.768
<i>I've lived here my whole life.</i>

27:34.987 --> 27:36.194
That must have been nice,

27:36.405 --> 27:37.612
growing up at a camp.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.281
Yeah, though it
has it's downsides.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.372
When I was younger I
wished we'd sell this place

27:42.536 --> 27:45.199
so we could live in a
town like normal people.

27:45.414 --> 27:46.495
Really?

27:46.707 --> 27:48.118
I was 10.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.290
I really wanted to
hang out at the mall.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.164
(chuckling)

27:52.379 --> 27:54.792
I've never told that to anyone.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.999
You must be special.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.301
And not just because you have
a tree branch in your hair.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.629
(gasps) How long has
that been in there?

28:02.848 --> 28:05.261
Not long, just the whole
time we were talking.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.309
Well, why didn't
you say something?

28:08.520 --> 28:09.880
I guess we could
help Twilight deal

28:10.063 --> 28:12.271
with the magic stuff
a little later.

28:12.482 --> 28:14.565
(bright upbeat music)

28:14.985 --> 28:18.194
Rock climbing is all about
perseverance and trust.

28:18.906 --> 28:22.149
Rarity, you can trust that
Applejack will spot you.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.825
Yeah, so you can totally
go faster than you're going.

28:25.037 --> 28:25.823
Rainbow Dash!

28:26.038 --> 28:28.781
Sorry, I've been waiting
to do this since we got here.

28:28.999 --> 28:31.537
Well, you'll have to wait
a little longer, darling.

28:34.338 --> 28:35.624
Oh, good, Twilight,

28:35.839 --> 28:37.546
if you spot me I can finally go.

28:37.758 --> 28:39.340
I'll go get another harness.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.632
I'm not sure...

28:40.844 --> 28:43.257
I better make sure my
sister doesn't need anything.

28:43.472 --> 28:44.472
See you later.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.017
Twilight, there you are.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.471
I was looking for you.
(earth rumbles)

28:52.689 --> 28:53.896
(campers shouting)

28:54.107 --> 28:55.348
Was that an earthquake?

28:55.567 --> 28:57.103
We aren't near any fault lines.

28:57.319 --> 28:58.400
<i>Hey!</i>

28:58.612 --> 29:01.901
Who left this crystal-y,
dusty stuff here?

29:02.991 --> 29:04.277
(yelps)

29:04.493 --> 29:07.486
I really would like
to come down now.

29:09.539 --> 29:12.077
Sorry, it's a little bit stuck.

29:12.292 --> 29:14.329
(screams)

29:18.465 --> 29:19.251
Applejack!

29:19.466 --> 29:20.798
What are you doing?

29:21.009 --> 29:23.422
Is everything okay over there?

29:23.637 --> 29:25.048
I don't know what happened.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.971
I didn't even pull
the rope that hard.

29:27.182 --> 29:30.016
It's like she was light as
a feather all of a sudden.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.513
I was scared half to death!

29:31.728 --> 29:33.219
It wasn't my fault!

29:33.438 --> 29:34.749
Let me help you get
your harness off.

29:34.773 --> 29:35.773
No, thank you!

29:35.941 --> 29:37.227
(yelps)

29:37.442 --> 29:38.442
(splash)

29:40.988 --> 29:43.105
What in the world just happened?

29:43.323 --> 29:46.737
Oh, dear, I am
so sorry, I think.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.782
Did I just do,
whatever that was?

29:49.997 --> 29:52.330
I don't think it was your fault.

29:52.541 --> 29:54.954
I'm gonna go get
Applejack a towel.

29:55.168 --> 29:56.168
Me too.

29:58.547 --> 30:00.539
You're not the only one
with a new kind of magic.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.757
This is great!

30:01.967 --> 30:03.424
No, it's not.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.795
Rarity and Applejack could
have really hurt each other.

30:05.887 --> 30:07.378
Why is this happening?

30:07.597 --> 30:08.804
- I don't...
- Hi, girls.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.302
Anything I can do for you?

30:10.517 --> 30:12.179
Applejack just
fell into the lake.

30:12.394 --> 30:13.394
Oh, no!

30:13.478 --> 30:15.936
She's gonna need warm
towels, dry clothes,

30:16.148 --> 30:17.730
oh, and a hot cocoa.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.398
I've got this!

30:21.445 --> 30:23.152
(high-pitched scream)

30:23.363 --> 30:24.695
Fluttershy?

30:24.906 --> 30:26.397
(dramatic instrumental music)

30:26.616 --> 30:28.357
What happened?

30:28.577 --> 30:29.613
I don't know.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.535
We were just decorating cookies.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.909
And I was all, you
need more sprinkles

30:34.124 --> 30:36.537
and you need more sprinkles!

30:36.752 --> 30:38.994
So, standard Pinky Pie stuff?

30:39.212 --> 30:41.204
I was just tossing
sprinkles to Fluttershy

30:41.423 --> 30:44.757
when all of a sudden, it
glowed pink and exploded.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.255
(loud boom)

30:49.014 --> 30:50.926
Just like that, only earlier.

30:51.141 --> 30:55.385
Okay, why don't you lay off
touching stuff for a while.

30:55.604 --> 30:59.439
Oh, dear, we really
should clean all of this up.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.439
Can someone help me out?

31:04.654 --> 31:06.566
(bird chirping)

31:09.201 --> 31:10.317
Thank you, Mr. Bird.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.151
(bird chirping)

31:12.371 --> 31:15.409
Why, of course I can get you
a little something to (gasps).

31:15.624 --> 31:18.367
- Did you just talk?
- (bird chirps)

31:18.585 --> 31:21.623
- But I don't speak chirp.
- (bird chirps)

31:21.838 --> 31:24.330
Well, I don't know if you're
the only bird I can understand.

31:24.549 --> 31:25.549
(bird chirps)

31:25.634 --> 31:27.626
Oh no, please don't
call for your friends.

31:27.844 --> 31:31.133
(birds chirping)

31:31.348 --> 31:33.385
It's nice to meet
all of you, too.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.967
Were you just
talking to the birds?

31:36.186 --> 31:38.143
Um, yes.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.395
(door opens, girl screams)

31:40.982 --> 31:42.314
Did you tell them what happened?

31:42.526 --> 31:43.526
So crazy.

31:43.693 --> 31:45.333
I hoisted Rarity up
the rock climbing wall

31:45.529 --> 31:46.610
like it was nothing.

31:46.822 --> 31:49.064
Like, I had way more
strength than I usually do.

31:49.282 --> 31:52.525
And I made a diamond-y
thing appear out of nowhere,

31:52.744 --> 31:54.235
which normally, I'd
be excited about,

31:54.454 --> 31:56.286
I mean the facets
were just perfect and the...

31:56.498 --> 31:57.079
Rarity!

31:57.290 --> 31:58.497
Oh! Sorry.

31:58.708 --> 32:01.746
It knocked Applejack over
and then it disappeared.

32:01.962 --> 32:04.079
Speaking of disappearing,

32:04.297 --> 32:06.004
has anybody seen Rainbow Dash?

32:06.216 --> 32:07.002
(gust of wind)

32:07.217 --> 32:08.003
(crash)

32:08.218 --> 32:09.254
Ow!

32:09.469 --> 32:11.335
Woah, how'd you do that?

32:11.555 --> 32:12.591
I don't know.

32:12.806 --> 32:14.217
I started running
to get the harness

32:14.433 --> 32:15.493
and then the next thing I knew,

32:15.517 --> 32:17.258
I was practically back in town.

32:17.477 --> 32:19.810
Well, if you had some
sort of super speed,

32:20.021 --> 32:21.762
why were you gone for so long?

32:21.982 --> 32:23.814
Because I lost it
when I got far away

32:24.025 --> 32:26.108
and then it came back
when I got close to camp.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.026
(gasp) Being at
camp is giving us

32:28.238 --> 32:30.946
all new magical abilities!

32:31.158 --> 32:32.945
Not all of us have
gotten new abilities.

32:33.160 --> 32:35.618
I haven't but Twilight...

32:35.829 --> 32:37.570
hasn't either.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.122
(sigh) So much for my
theory that leaving CHS

32:40.333 --> 32:42.791
would mean leaving any
new magic business behind.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.837
Something at the camp
must be making this happen.

32:46.047 --> 32:48.334
Um, Gaia Everfree?

32:48.550 --> 32:49.256
(creaking)

32:49.468 --> 32:51.710
(screams)

32:51.928 --> 32:53.965
Applejack, I was
looking for you.

32:54.181 --> 32:57.470
Here, I brought you some
towels and dry clothes.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.596
Oh. What happened in here?

32:59.811 --> 33:01.848
We're kinda tryin' to
figure that out.

33:02.063 --> 33:03.224
Well, don't worry about it.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.226
I got this!

33:04.441 --> 33:05.648
<i>Gloriosa!</i>

33:05.859 --> 33:08.522
I kicked my beanbag
into the lake.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.403
I'll get you another one.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.356
And I'm all out of arrows.

33:13.575 --> 33:16.409
Say no more, new
arrows coming right up.

33:16.620 --> 33:18.236
There you are.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.866
Filthy Rich is back.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.619
- You want me to handle it?
- Absolutely not!

33:22.834 --> 33:24.666
I've got this!
(screaming)

33:24.878 --> 33:27.495
Fluttershy, enough
with the screaming.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.377
- I didn't scream.
- For once.

33:30.592 --> 33:31.673
Nobody did.

33:31.885 --> 33:32.466
Huh?

33:32.677 --> 33:34.259
<i>(loudspeaker)
Attention, campers,</i>

33:34.471 --> 33:37.259
<i>anyone who's interested in
making floating paper lanterns,</i>

33:37.474 --> 33:40.262
<i>please meet us by
the picnic tables.</i>

33:40.477 --> 33:41.917
I don't know about
the rest of y'all,

33:42.062 --> 33:44.302
but I've been lookin' forward
to comin' here for a month.

33:44.439 --> 33:47.227
Maybe we forget about
this new magic for a bit

33:47.442 --> 33:51.026
and just try to focus on
enjoying our time at camp.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.900
I was oh-so-excited
about the designs

33:53.114 --> 33:54.834
I've come up with for
the camp fashion show.

33:55.033 --> 33:58.117
And I've barely gotten to
work anybody in tetherball.

33:58.328 --> 34:00.411
I think we should
try to figure it out

34:00.622 --> 34:03.706
but if letting it go for now
is what the rest of you want...

34:03.917 --> 34:07.501
(girls cheer in agreement)

34:15.053 --> 34:16.668
Um, Pinky Pie?

34:16.888 --> 34:18.379
What are you doing?

34:18.598 --> 34:19.958
Putting marshmallows
in my lantern.

34:20.100 --> 34:21.181
Then when we light them,

34:21.393 --> 34:24.351
mine will be beautiful
and delicious!

34:25.522 --> 34:26.603
Hey, Twilight,

34:26.815 --> 34:28.226
why aren't you
with everyone else?

34:28.440 --> 34:30.023
Sunset said something
at camp is causing

34:30.235 --> 34:32.272
the other girls
to get new magic.

34:32.487 --> 34:34.274
I think it's Midnight Sparkle.

34:34.489 --> 34:36.650
She's still part of
me, I can feel it.

34:36.866 --> 34:39.609
And I think her magic
is infecting my friends.

34:39.828 --> 34:41.069
What are we gonna do?

34:41.288 --> 34:43.245
I don't know what I can do.

34:43.456 --> 34:48.326
Okay, everyone, it's time
to watch your lanterns fly.

34:48.545 --> 34:51.504
(bright upbeat music)

34:54.092 --> 34:56.254
Hey, cool lantern.

34:56.469 --> 34:58.506
Mine's my face.

34:59.723 --> 35:02.716
(giggles nervously)

35:05.937 --> 35:08.680
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hmm.

35:08.898 --> 35:12.767
You don't seem like
yourself tonight.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.575
Ready, and go!

35:21.786 --> 35:25.325
(bright enchanting music)

35:28.418 --> 35:31.377
Aw, oh well, now
I get to eat it.

35:33.089 --> 35:35.331
Yup, beautiful and delicious.

35:35.550 --> 35:39.009
(bright enchanting music)

35:47.020 --> 35:48.556
(snoring)

35:49.564 --> 35:52.432
(gasp) Twilight?

35:55.695 --> 35:56.776
Twilight!

35:58.365 --> 35:59.606
Where is she going?

35:59.824 --> 36:03.158
(dark suspenseful music)

36:05.038 --> 36:06.038
(branch snaps)

36:06.122 --> 36:07.122
Twilight?

36:09.292 --> 36:10.908
What are you doing out here?

36:11.127 --> 36:14.211
We're meeting a
cab to take us home.

36:15.507 --> 36:16.947
She thought you'd
talk her out of it.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.249
Because I would.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.505
Twilight, you can't leave.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.885
You don't think it
was the spirit, do you?

36:25.100 --> 36:27.433
No, it was me.

36:27.644 --> 36:29.306
I think it's Midnight Sparkle.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.638
She's still part of
me, I can feel it.

36:31.856 --> 36:35.725
And I think her magic
is infecting my friends.

36:37.696 --> 36:40.109
Twilight, there's
no Midnight Sparkle.

36:40.323 --> 36:41.609
There's only you.

36:41.825 --> 36:43.612
How did you know
what I was thinking?

36:43.827 --> 36:45.068
When I touched your hand,

36:45.286 --> 36:46.447
I could see things.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.326
I could understand
why you were leaving.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.998
My new magic.

36:51.209 --> 36:52.620
This is my new magic.

36:52.836 --> 36:53.997
This is incredible!

36:54.212 --> 36:55.498
No, it's not.

36:55.714 --> 36:56.955
I'm infecting you now.

36:57.173 --> 37:00.086
Twilight, you have to stop
looking at this as a bad thing.

37:00.301 --> 37:01.542
Easy for you to say.

37:01.761 --> 37:03.718
Magic turned you into
something beautiful.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.717
The last time I tried to use it,

37:05.932 --> 37:07.468
it turned me into a monster.

37:07.934 --> 37:09.926
I'm just so afraid it's
gonna happen again.

37:10.186 --> 37:13.429
Yes, last time I turned
into something amazing

37:13.648 --> 37:16.732
but I've let magic turn
me into a monster, too.

37:16.943 --> 37:19.526
So if anyone understands
what you're going through,

37:19.738 --> 37:20.854
it's me.

37:21.072 --> 37:22.313
I can help you, Twilight,

37:22.532 --> 37:23.612
and the rest of our friends

37:23.700 --> 37:24.440
can be there for you too,

37:24.659 --> 37:26.571
but not if you run away.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.449
(sigh) I'll stay.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.280
But I still don't
think it's a good idea

37:31.499 --> 37:33.539
for me to be near the rest
of our friends right now.

37:33.626 --> 37:35.868
Not until we know why
this is happening.

37:36.212 --> 37:37.293
Understood.

37:37.505 --> 37:38.505
(branch breaks)

37:39.174 --> 37:40.174
What was that?

37:40.925 --> 37:42.632
(screaming)

37:43.052 --> 37:44.918
Wait, Twilight?

37:46.014 --> 37:47.095
Timber?

37:47.265 --> 37:48.927
I'm so glad it's just you.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.633
Wait, what are you
doing out here?

37:50.852 --> 37:52.059
With an ax?

37:53.188 --> 37:55.976
I was chopping down firewood.

37:56.191 --> 37:57.557
In the middle of the night?

37:57.776 --> 38:00.018
We needed more for
tomorrow night's campfire

38:00.236 --> 38:02.273
and if I didn't take
care of it tonight,

38:02.489 --> 38:06.028
it would be one more thing
Gloriosa would add to her list.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.242
I've got this!

38:07.368 --> 38:08.575
(giggling)

38:08.787 --> 38:09.994
What about you two?

38:10.205 --> 38:11.605
Why are you hanging
out in the woods

38:11.706 --> 38:13.117
in the middle of the night?

38:13.333 --> 38:15.245
Oh, I was sleep walking.

38:15.460 --> 38:17.827
Twilight found me and was
bringing me back to camp.

38:18.046 --> 38:19.628
- Mm-hmm.
- Come on,

38:19.839 --> 38:21.421
I'll walk you guys back.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.215
I'll protect you from

38:23.426 --> 38:25.383
Gaia Everfree.

38:25.637 --> 38:29.256
Everfree, Everfree!

38:30.642 --> 38:33.180
Come on, that's obviously
just a spooky story

38:33.394 --> 38:35.602
you made up to tell
around the campfire.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.680
Oh no, it's legit.

38:37.899 --> 38:40.141
How else would you explain
what happened at the docks?

38:40.360 --> 38:42.602
And that weird thing
where the earth shook?

38:42.821 --> 38:46.405
Come on, I know a shortcut
back to the tents.

38:47.492 --> 38:48.608
(twinkling sparkles)

38:52.539 --> 38:53.575
Legit, huh?

38:54.207 --> 38:57.200
I think we just found
our Gaia Everfree.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.875
But why would he work so hard

38:59.087 --> 39:00.623
to make us think she was real?

39:00.839 --> 39:01.959
You heard what he said about

39:02.090 --> 39:03.956
wishing his sister
would sell this camp.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.711
If nobody wants to
come here because

39:05.927 --> 39:08.840
it's home to some angry,
ancient nature spirit,

39:09.055 --> 39:10.887
it sure would help his cause.

39:11.099 --> 39:12.590
We should tell Twilight.

39:12.809 --> 39:13.845
Not yet.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.552
She's obviously going
through a lot right now.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.263
We should probably be 100%
sure before we tell her

39:19.482 --> 39:21.348
the guy she likes is a jerk

39:21.568 --> 39:23.730
who's tryin' to run
everybody out of camp.

39:23.945 --> 39:24.945
Uh-Huh.

39:25.864 --> 39:27.821
(hammering)

39:29.534 --> 39:31.867
(dock creaks)

39:35.456 --> 39:36.456
Phew!

39:37.500 --> 39:40.834
Ugh, you gonna give us
a hand here, Rarity?

39:41.045 --> 39:42.411
I would love to,

39:42.630 --> 39:44.191
but I really need to get the
stitching on this poncho done

39:44.215 --> 39:46.707
if it's going to make it
into the camp fashion show.

39:46.926 --> 39:48.153
Though at the pace
you two are moving,

39:48.177 --> 39:50.760
I don't know that the runway
will ever be finished.

39:50.972 --> 39:53.339
The dock is our gift to the camp

39:53.558 --> 39:55.345
and it's gonna get finished.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.040
That is if Rainbow
Dash would hurry up

39:57.228 --> 39:58.890
and bring me more wood.

39:59.105 --> 40:00.892
I can't go any faster.

40:01.107 --> 40:03.099
I don't wanna end up
in the woods again.

40:03.318 --> 40:05.184
Don't be silly.

40:05.403 --> 40:06.403
Really?

40:09.115 --> 40:11.698
(sigh) I know I said
we should try to forget

40:11.910 --> 40:15.620
all about this new magic
business, but I can't.

40:15.830 --> 40:17.947
What if I hammer the
board into splinters?

40:18.166 --> 40:19.282
Uh-huh.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.709
Oh shoot, I'm all outta nails.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.787
Oh, here you go.

40:25.006 --> 40:26.793
Pinky, don't!

40:30.428 --> 40:32.636
(sigh)

40:32.847 --> 40:33.963
What?

40:34.182 --> 40:35.468
Ooh, did you think the nails

40:35.683 --> 40:37.174
would explode like
the sprinkles?

40:37.393 --> 40:39.385
Wow, glad that
didn't happen, huh?

40:40.688 --> 40:42.975
Sorry girls, I didn't mean to.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.649
I don't know how
to control this.

40:45.860 --> 40:46.860
It's okay.

40:47.070 --> 40:48.652
None of us do.

40:48.863 --> 40:51.901
Which is why we shouldn't
pretend this isn't happening.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.357
Do you have them now too?

40:53.576 --> 40:54.612
It started last night.

40:54.827 --> 40:55.827
When I touch people,

40:55.954 --> 40:57.431
it's like I can feel
what they're feeling

40:57.455 --> 40:58.696
and see their memories.

40:58.915 --> 41:00.201
Ooh, fancy!

41:00.416 --> 41:01.532
Try me, try me!

41:03.878 --> 41:06.086
(cheering and singing)

41:06.297 --> 41:07.629
Ooh, taffy!

41:11.135 --> 41:12.967
That explains so much.

41:13.179 --> 41:14.545
Yup!

41:14.764 --> 41:17.131
Girls, we can't just
brush these powers aside

41:17.350 --> 41:20.843
because it doesn't seem like
the ideal time to get them.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.678
What if it turns
out that they could

41:22.897 --> 41:25.890
actually make things better?

41:26.109 --> 41:27.941
<i>♪ So you have magic</i>

Okay, that was pretty awesome.

43:55.341 --> 43:57.503
And look what you
managed to accomplish.

44:01.305 --> 44:02.466
Please, please, please,

44:02.682 --> 44:04.284
can we do our run-through
for the fashion show

44:04.308 --> 44:05.799
on it, right this minute?

44:06.018 --> 44:07.218
I thought you weren't finished

44:07.270 --> 44:09.728
with the stitching
on your poncho?

44:09.939 --> 44:11.976
I am now.

44:12.191 --> 44:13.191
Get started without me.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.317
I gotta go find Twilight.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.754
Seeing what we've
been able to do here

44:15.778 --> 44:18.065
might make her embrace
the new magic, too.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.238
Uh, not that she has any.

44:22.118 --> 44:26.158
<i>I just wish you didn't tell
them that ridiculous story!</i>

44:26.372 --> 44:28.238
<i>Ah! This is all too
much for you.</i>

44:28.457 --> 44:30.198
<i>You have to let it go!</i>

44:30.418 --> 44:34.332
I knew it, he wants her
to get rid of the camp.

44:36.299 --> 44:39.292
(door squeaks)

44:39.510 --> 44:40.717
Sunset Shimmer?

44:40.928 --> 44:42.368
What were you doing
behind that door?

44:42.430 --> 44:44.137
What? Um, nothing.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.180
I um, lost an earring.

44:46.392 --> 44:48.258
Uh, there it is.

44:49.145 --> 44:51.683
Hey, listen, I'm
glad I ran into you.

44:51.898 --> 44:53.230
I really wanted to thank you.

44:53.441 --> 44:54.441
For what?

44:55.151 --> 44:56.687
For the tough love.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.895
Telling me I should
get over Twilight.

44:59.113 --> 45:00.113
I needed to hear that.

45:00.198 --> 45:01.985
Sure, no problem.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.611
Is something wrong?

45:03.826 --> 45:05.783
What? No, why?

45:06.037 --> 45:07.037
Come on, Sunset.

45:07.163 --> 45:08.324
We used to date.

45:08.539 --> 45:10.121
I know when something's
bothering you.

45:10.333 --> 45:13.826
(sigh) Okay, here's the deal.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.245
My friend really likes someone

45:15.421 --> 45:17.482
but I don't think that someone
is who she thinks they are.

45:17.506 --> 45:19.610
I don't wanna upset my friend
by telling her what I think

45:19.634 --> 45:21.296
because I also wanna
protect her because

45:21.510 --> 45:23.470
if what I think is happening,
is really happening,

45:23.554 --> 45:26.672
then she deserves
to know, you know?

45:26.891 --> 45:28.257
No.

45:28.684 --> 45:30.550
But what I do know
is that your friend

45:30.770 --> 45:32.978
is lucky to have someone like
you to looK out for them.

45:33.189 --> 45:34.189
Really?

45:34.232 --> 45:35.313
Yeah.

45:35.524 --> 45:37.937
You know, you've changed
a lot since we went out.

45:38.152 --> 45:39.484
You're so much,

45:39.695 --> 45:40.695
nicer.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.655
Thanks, I'm glad you noticed.

45:43.866 --> 45:48.907
Look, maybe you and me, we
could start over as friends.

45:49.121 --> 45:50.202
Uh, sounds great.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.825
I gotta go.

45:52.041 --> 45:55.409
Cool, yeah, I wanna
start over later too.

46:04.387 --> 46:07.755
(dark mysterious music)

46:12.311 --> 46:13.552
(earth rumbles)

46:19.026 --> 46:20.026
Shoot!

46:20.695 --> 46:22.903
He's definitely up to something.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.649
(phone rings)

46:27.868 --> 46:28.654
(phone beeps)

46:28.869 --> 46:29.869
It's Sunset.

46:29.954 --> 46:31.431
She says to meet her
by the rock quarry.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.822
But I thought we weren't
supposed to hike out that far.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.657
She says it's important.

46:42.008 --> 46:43.008
What is that?

46:43.175 --> 46:44.382
(screams)

46:44.844 --> 46:45.844
Shh!

46:48.097 --> 46:50.430
(dark mysterious music)

46:50.933 --> 46:52.219
What's going on down there?

46:52.435 --> 46:55.724
I think it's Gaia
Everfree or rather,

46:55.938 --> 46:58.180
someone who wants us
to think she's back.

46:58.399 --> 46:59.515
Come on.

46:59.734 --> 47:02.101
(dark suspenseful music)

47:07.033 --> 47:10.868
Whoa, this place is beautiful.

47:11.495 --> 47:14.454
There's Equestrian magic here.

47:14.832 --> 47:15.993
I can...

47:16.167 --> 47:17.167
I can feel it.

47:17.543 --> 47:19.751
Wait, I thought
Timber was just faking

47:19.962 --> 47:21.954
there was a magical
nature creature.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.289
Are you saying it's real?

47:23.507 --> 47:24.588
<i>Timber?</i>

47:24.800 --> 47:26.416
What does he have to
do with any of this?

47:26.635 --> 47:27.635
<i>Nothing.</i>

47:29.847 --> 47:31.133
It's all me.

47:33.267 --> 47:34.633
Gloriosa?

47:34.852 --> 47:36.263
But Timber.

47:36.562 --> 47:39.100
I was sure he was the one
trying to make it seem

47:39.315 --> 47:40.806
like Gaia Everfree was back.

47:41.025 --> 47:43.563
It was you who was trying
to scare everyone away?

47:43.778 --> 47:47.943
I would never try to scare
anyone away from Camp Everfree.

47:49.450 --> 47:53.945
Now, now, you fell behind
on your payments, Gloriosa.

47:54.163 --> 47:56.576
I own the land now.

47:56.791 --> 47:59.283
Please, my great grandparents
founded this place.

47:59.502 --> 48:01.789
It's been in our
family for generations.

48:02.004 --> 48:03.870
You have to let the camp stay.

48:04.090 --> 48:06.423
Instead of turning
it into a spa resort

48:06.634 --> 48:08.500
that will line my
pockets with more money

48:08.719 --> 48:10.711
than this camp ever could?

48:10.930 --> 48:13.638
(chuckles) I don't think so.

48:13.849 --> 48:16.091
But please, I... I...

48:16.310 --> 48:18.677
I just need a little more time.

48:18.896 --> 48:22.981
Fine, I'll give you
'till the end of the month.

48:23.776 --> 48:26.018
(weeping)

48:28.155 --> 48:29.362
What'll I do?

48:32.660 --> 48:35.448
(mystical music)

48:38.249 --> 48:39.490
(explosion)

48:46.215 --> 48:47.831
(coughing)

48:48.050 --> 48:49.050
Wow.

49:03.691 --> 49:06.149
You don't know what
those things are.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.852
But I know what they can do!

49:09.071 --> 49:10.403
I've been practicing.

49:10.656 --> 49:12.898
I can control their power now.

49:13.117 --> 49:15.484
You don't know that for sure.

49:18.706 --> 49:21.449
This is our camp and
it's being taken away.

49:21.667 --> 49:23.579
If this has to be
our last week here,

49:23.794 --> 49:27.879
I'm going to use whatever
it takes to make it count!

49:44.773 --> 49:47.481
(earth rumbles)

49:48.777 --> 49:50.860
You were using magic
all over the place.

49:51.071 --> 49:53.233
I had to tell them
something to cover for you.

49:53.449 --> 49:55.111
What did you want me to do?

49:55.326 --> 49:59.366
I just wish you didn't tell
them that ridiculous story!

50:00.122 --> 50:02.114
Ah! This is all
too much for you.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.120
You have to let it go.

50:06.545 --> 50:09.538
Timber wasn't talking
about letting go of the camp.

50:09.757 --> 50:13.922
He was talking about you letting
go of the magical geodes.

50:14.136 --> 50:15.376
All those things you were doing

50:15.513 --> 50:17.630
to make this week,
the best week ever,

50:17.848 --> 50:20.591
every time you used
magic to do them,

50:20.809 --> 50:23.517
it caused another
problem somewhere else.

50:24.813 --> 50:27.851
Timber was covering for you.

50:28.067 --> 50:30.059
How do you know what I
was doing with the geodes?

50:30.277 --> 50:32.394
How do you know about the magic?

50:32.613 --> 50:35.321
I can see things, feel things

50:35.533 --> 50:37.240
because I have magic, too

50:37.451 --> 50:40.319
and so does she, and
so do our friends.

50:40.538 --> 50:43.076
Gloriosa, Timber wasn't wrong.

50:43.290 --> 50:45.282
Maybe you should
stop using magic.

50:45.501 --> 50:48.039
Too much of it can be dangerous
if you can't control it.

50:48.254 --> 50:49.916
Oh, I got this.

50:50.130 --> 50:53.419
And I'm going to use
it to save my camp.

50:53.634 --> 50:55.796
I just need more power.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.011
No!

51:15.155 --> 51:18.398
Sorry, girls, I
know what I need to do

51:18.617 --> 51:22.236
but I feel like we're
not on the same page, so...

51:23.706 --> 51:25.368
Gloriosa!

51:25.583 --> 51:28.496
(dark mystical music)

51:31.005 --> 51:32.462
No!

51:37.553 --> 51:39.590
(bright upbeat music)

51:39.805 --> 51:41.922
(giggling)

51:43.559 --> 51:45.551
Where are Twilight and Sunset?

51:45.769 --> 51:48.227
Oh, they're missing
our dress rehearsal.

51:50.524 --> 51:52.186
I suppose we can get
started without them.

51:52.401 --> 51:54.142
Whenever you're ready!

51:56.447 --> 51:59.155
(upbeat pop music)

52:02.328 --> 52:03.739
Told you, you'd like it.

52:03.954 --> 52:06.492
It's all right, I guess.

52:06.707 --> 52:09.040
I do get to keep it after
camp, though, right?

52:15.466 --> 52:18.425
(dark sinister music)

52:25.351 --> 52:27.513
She looks different.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.478
Yeah, she looks taller.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.518
(upbeat pop music)

52:35.527 --> 52:37.564
This is only a preview.

52:37.780 --> 52:41.114
I've got another entire line
I'll debut at the real thing.

52:41.325 --> 52:42.325
(record scratches)

52:42.660 --> 52:43.741
Why did you stop the...

52:43.952 --> 52:46.410
(gasp) Oh my goodness!

52:47.414 --> 52:49.497
Attention, campers!

52:49.708 --> 52:51.745
It's Gaia Everfree!

52:51.960 --> 52:53.041
She's real!

52:53.253 --> 52:55.586
Ah, we're doomed!

52:55.798 --> 52:57.289
Gloriosa?

52:57.508 --> 52:59.545
What are you doing?

52:59.760 --> 53:01.296
That's Gloriosa?

53:01.512 --> 53:04.721
Am I goin' crazy or are her
feet not touchin' the ground?

53:04.932 --> 53:06.343
Freaky-Deaky!

53:06.809 --> 53:09.301
I have an announcement to make!

53:09.520 --> 53:10.886
<i>Filthy Rich wants this to be</i>

53:11.105 --> 53:13.688

(earth rumbles)

53:25.119 --> 53:27.361
(screaming)

53:27.579 --> 53:29.491
Oh, come on!

53:29.707 --> 53:31.949
We literally just
finished building that!

55:25.322 --> 55:30.363

55:32.412 --> 55:36.702
(sigh) Why do these kinds
of things always happen to us?

55:38.210 --> 55:39.917
What are we going to do?

55:40.128 --> 55:41.790
What we always do.

55:42.005 --> 55:43.005
Save the day!

55:45.425 --> 55:47.291
(cheering)
Let's do it!

55:47.511 --> 55:48.922
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

55:49.137 --> 55:50.924
This is gonna be so much fun!

55:51.139 --> 55:54.382
I only wish we had time
to make superhero capes!

55:54.601 --> 55:55.601
Oh, me too.

55:56.520 --> 55:58.432
Enough about our wardrobe.

55:58.647 --> 56:01.139
We've gotta stop Gloriosa from
trapping everybody in here.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.560
(screaming)

56:16.540 --> 56:20.204
(sweet innocent music)

56:20.419 --> 56:24.584
Hi, do you think you
can give us a hand or paw?

56:24.798 --> 56:28.838
We could really use a way out.
(animals chatter)

56:31.513 --> 56:34.130
(heroic music)

56:42.691 --> 56:45.399
(animals chatter)

56:53.702 --> 56:56.160
(loud boom)

56:57.122 --> 56:59.660
(dark music)

57:08.133 --> 57:10.170
(yelp)

57:28.445 --> 57:29.481
(sparkles boom)

57:31.907 --> 57:32.943
This isn't working.

57:33.158 --> 57:35.115
Her magic is too strong.

57:35.327 --> 57:37.660
(dog growls)

57:39.039 --> 57:40.496
Nice work, Spike.

57:42.334 --> 57:45.168
(grunting)

57:45.379 --> 57:47.371
Twilight, you have
to use your magic.

57:47.589 --> 57:49.876
I don't think I can
lift something that big.

57:50.092 --> 57:51.772
It's our only chance
of getting our of here

57:51.969 --> 57:53.801
and helping our friends.

57:59.059 --> 58:01.517
(heroic music)

58:06.608 --> 58:09.567
(branches snapping)

58:18.245 --> 58:20.328
Why are you fighting me?

58:20.539 --> 58:22.576
I'm doing this to save our camp!

58:22.791 --> 58:24.783
I'm doing this for you.

58:25.002 --> 58:26.709
(chuckles nervously)
Gloriosa,

58:26.920 --> 58:29.663
let's just think about this
for a moment, shall we?

58:29.881 --> 58:34.125
I mean, I think Camp Everfree
is absolutely delightful

58:34.344 --> 58:36.176
but I just don't know
that I'm quite ready

58:36.388 --> 58:39.131
to give up my weekly
trips to the spa.

58:39.349 --> 58:41.090
To the spa.
(mimics)

58:41.309 --> 58:43.301
To the spa!
(dark sinister music)

58:46.565 --> 58:48.682
(yelping)

58:50.027 --> 58:52.770
Gloriosa, this isn't the way.

58:52.988 --> 58:55.401
I appreciate your
concern, Timber,

58:55.615 --> 58:57.777
but I got this!

58:58.535 --> 59:00.242
(yelps, dark sinister music)

59:00.829 --> 59:02.161
No, you don't!

59:08.253 --> 59:12.338
(shouts) Twilight, do you
think you can use your magic?

59:13.341 --> 59:14.798
I don't wanna use too much,

59:15.010 --> 59:17.047
Midnight Sparkle
could take over.

59:17.262 --> 59:20.175
Twilight, our
friends are in there.

59:23.602 --> 59:24.602
Okay.

59:30.650 --> 59:33.563
Please, Gloriosa, what
you're doing is crazy.

59:33.779 --> 59:35.395
You have to listen to me!

59:35.614 --> 59:37.276
That isn't Gloriosa.

59:41.620 --> 59:43.202
- Twilight!
- Sunset!

59:43.413 --> 59:44.620
You're okay.

59:44.831 --> 59:46.242
That isn't your sister,

59:46.458 --> 59:48.791
it's someone who's been
consumed by Equestrian magic.

59:50.921 --> 59:53.755
Whoever you are, you
have to let my sister go.

59:53.965 --> 59:56.002
Please, Gloriosa, come back.

59:56.218 --> 59:57.334
I need you.

01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:01.546
Gloriosa!

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:04.849
(dark sinister music)

01:00:05.477 --> 01:00:06.684
(explosion)

01:00:13.735 --> 01:00:15.101
Rarity!

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.991
I can't keep this up forever.

01:00:22.202 --> 01:00:23.443
It's up to you.

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:26.279
You can use your magic to
pull the brambles apart.

01:00:26.498 --> 01:00:28.364
No, there's too many of them.

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:30.950
It would take too
much magic, I can't!

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.455
It's the only way.

01:00:32.671 --> 01:00:35.084
You have to embrace
the magic inside you.

01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.005
But what if she takes over?

01:00:37.217 --> 01:00:39.083
What if, instead
of saving everyone,

01:00:39.302 --> 01:00:41.715
I turn into Midnight Sparkle
and only make things worse?

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:43.341
That won't happen.

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.139
We won't let it.

01:00:45.350 --> 01:00:48.843
(diamond shield cracking)

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:50.803
(heroic music)

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:59.111
Come on, Twilight, you have
to be stronger than she is.

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:08.200
(laughs maniacally)
You will never control me.

01:01:08.415 --> 01:01:10.907
I will always be a part of you.

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.204
No!

01:01:17.382 --> 01:01:21.251
Twilight, listen to
me, you are in charge.

01:01:21.469 --> 01:01:25.463
You are a light,
darling, a force of good.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.891
Yeah, you can kick
the darkness's butt!

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:30.968
We're here for you, Twilight.

01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.601
And we'll be here,
no matter what.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.102
We believe in you.

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:41.821
You are not Midnight Sparkle!

01:01:42.949 --> 01:01:47.410
No, I am Twilight Sparkle

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:50.739
and the magic I
carry inside me is

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.789
the magic of friendship.

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:57.335
(explodes)

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:02.208
No! (yelps)

01:02:03.345 --> 01:02:07.259
(triumphant instrumental music)

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:38.212
(explodes)

01:02:38.546 --> 01:02:40.162
(sparkles twinkling)

01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:42.715
(campers gasp)

01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:51.642
Gloriosa?

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.520
What, what happened?

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:58.313
It's okay.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.107
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:09.276
(campers applaud and cheer)

01:03:10.328 --> 01:03:11.328
You did it!

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.825
Oh, nice bling.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.157
What are these?

01:03:16.376 --> 01:03:17.583
I'm not sure.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:20.662
But clearly we have some
kind of connection to them.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.418
I almost don't
care what they are,

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.420
they are gorgeous!

01:03:25.635 --> 01:03:27.571
(gasp) And will totally go
with the other collection

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:32.181
I was working on for the
camp fashion show. (giggles)

01:03:32.392 --> 01:03:35.976
That's probably
canceled, isn't it?

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.394
I am so sorry.

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.396
I only wanted this
to be the best week

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.352
Camp Everfree has ever had

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:48.690
and instead, I've
made it the worst.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:49.989
Maybe it's for the best

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.318
that I'm losing the
camp to Filthy Rich.

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.449
No, it's not.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:57.281
This camp has meant so
much to so many people.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.742
My sister and me included.

01:03:59.961 --> 01:04:03.170
Why do you think we wanted
our students to come here?

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:06.169
We can't let Filthy
Rich take this place away.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:08.341
<i>If camp meant so
much to you two,</i>

01:04:08.553 --> 01:04:10.233
maybe it meant as much
to the other campers

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.220
who came here in years past.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:15.470
And maybe we can get
them to help save it!

01:04:15.685 --> 01:04:17.392
Oh, like a fundraiser?

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.311
Or a ball?

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:20.763
Our band could play.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:24.146
I could help write a new
song just for the occasion.

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.104
(campers chatter)

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:29.647
Those are all good ideas,

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.402
but where would we hold it?

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.655
We could hold it
in the crystal cave.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:38.160
(gasp) A crystal
ball, I love it!

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:41.584
I admire everyone's
enthusiasm, really I do.

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:43.377
But I just don't know
how we're going to

01:04:43.588 --> 01:04:46.501
plan a ball by tomorrow
and invite everyone.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:49.709
We got this!

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:52.671

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.022
(cheering)

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.901
Thank you all so much for coming

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.160
and for helping us
raise enough money to

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.458
save Camp Everfree!

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:29.126
(cheering)

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.707
Thank you for everything.

01:07:34.926 --> 01:07:37.714
(sigh) If I just asked for
help in the first place.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.716
(chuckles) Don't sweat it!

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.547
It's kinda what we do.

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.598
Not to brag or anything,

01:07:51.818 --> 01:07:54.231
but it's pretty cool how
I saved all those campers

01:07:54.445 --> 01:07:56.107
from those rubus fruticosus.

01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:58.322
Blackberry brambles.

01:07:58.533 --> 01:07:59.865
I'm familiar with the genus.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:02.784
It's just a little weird you
say you saved the campers.

01:08:02.996 --> 01:08:04.453
I thought I saved them.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:07.532
Yeah, but I saved you
from falling on the dock

01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:09.616
so that you could
save the campers.

01:08:09.836 --> 01:08:12.169
So, technically, it was all me.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:16.332
(giggles) I'm
really glad I met you.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.417
Uh-oh.

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:19.636
What?

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:21.799
That sounds like a goodbye

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.349
and here I was hoping we'd
still be able to hang out.

01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:29.395
Maybe get dinner
and catch a movie?

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.107
Yeah, I'd really like that.

01:08:34.736 --> 01:08:37.979
Oh good, I was hoping
that's what this meant.

01:08:38.865 --> 01:08:40.902
(sweet romantic music)

01:08:45.705 --> 01:08:46.705
Oh, uh,

01:08:46.913 --> 01:08:48.576
(chuckles)
sorry.

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.157
I need to borrow Timber.

01:08:50.376 --> 01:08:52.834
There are some donors I
really want him to meet.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:54.787
They were good friends
with mom and dad.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:59.299
Save me a dance, okay?

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:01.377
Uh-huh.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.506
Adorable.

01:09:03.805 --> 01:09:05.843
He does seem like
a pretty cool guy.

01:09:06.059 --> 01:09:07.550
You know what else is cool?

01:09:07.769 --> 01:09:10.477
Our awesome, new superpowers!

01:09:10.688 --> 01:09:11.848
I handed out like 400 flyers,

01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.813
set up the stage,

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.267
and still had time
to pick up pizza.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.193
I love my super speed.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:20.270
About that, I think the crystals

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:22.698
are the source of
the superpowers.

01:09:22.908 --> 01:09:25.242
You're not gonna ask us
to give them up, are you?

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:28.196
No, in fact, I think maybe,

01:09:28.413 --> 01:09:30.576
we were meant to
have them all along.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:31.792
Me too.

01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.541
(cheering)

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.631
(soft tender music)

01:09:43.136 --> 01:09:46.130
There is one thing I'm
still wondering about, though.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:47.349
What's that?

01:09:47.558 --> 01:09:50.767
Where did the magic that
hit this cave come from?

01:09:50.978 --> 01:09:54.813
(mysterious instrumental music)

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.153
(upbeat music)

Or is it fifth?

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:45.517
I've lost track.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.978
All that matters is that
the runway is finished.

01:12:48.197 --> 01:12:50.280
I think you mean, the dock.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.279
Oh, ta-mato, tomato.
