17:57.699 --> 17:58.698
He's not gonna be here.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.834
Hey, read his post.

18:00.902 --> 18:05.071
It's a squirrel with a Santa hat.
Dad, this means nothing.

18:05.173 --> 18:06.640
[Sighs] Jimmy, read the caption.

18:06.708 --> 18:07.874
"I'm over Valentine's Day.

18:07.943 --> 18:09.743
I wish I could go back to Christmas."

18:09.811 --> 18:12.445
Kenny and Brett met in the choir
room during Christmastime.

18:12.514 --> 18:13.647
I promise you he is here.

18:13.715 --> 18:16.116
[Piano playing]

18:16.218 --> 18:17.717
[Sighs]

18:17.819 --> 18:20.966
Hey, buddy. What are you doing?

18:21.082 --> 18:23.723
I took myself on a date
to make myself feel better,

18:23.792 --> 18:25.426
but I'm not Liz, mon.

18:25.496 --> 18:28.695
I can't just book a flight,
enjoy the touch of a local fisherman,

18:28.797 --> 18:30.163
and magically feel better.

18:30.232 --> 18:32.766
This night has made me feel
even more alone.

18:32.868 --> 18:34.167
This is my alone chord.

18:34.269 --> 18:35.635
[Minor chord plays]

18:35.737 --> 18:37.971
It's from "Music Man."

18:38.073 --> 18:39.139
[Dissonant notes play]

18:39.241 --> 18:40.306
[Sighs]

18:40.409 --> 18:42.609
Come on, little buddy.

18:42.711 --> 18:45.378
Let's get you away from this sad piano.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.546
You are so light.

18:46.648 --> 18:48.848
Thank you. I haven't been eating.

18:52.888 --> 18:54.387
[Grunts]

18:54.489 --> 18:56.790
[Clears throat]

18:56.858 --> 18:59.759
Took me 16 years
to get my first boyfriend,

18:59.828 --> 19:02.123
and I lost him in six weeks.

19:02.239 --> 19:04.497
And one of those weeks, he had strep,
so it doesn't even count.

19:04.599 --> 19:08.489
Well, hey, look, it took me 18 years
to have my first Valentine's Day,

19:08.560 --> 19:10.503
and it didn't work out so well, either.

19:10.572 --> 19:15.408
But you are gonna have many,
many more boyfriends in your life.

19:15.477 --> 19:17.711
And some will last weeks.
Some will last months.

19:17.779 --> 19:20.346
Some will last a night!

19:22.317 --> 19:23.750
I was going to say

19:23.785 --> 19:27.120
was that hopefully one
will last a lifetime.

19:27.155 --> 19:30.523
But for now you go through
as much heartache as you need.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.325
Do you mean it?

19:32.394 --> 19:34.427
Yes, of course.

19:34.529 --> 19:37.497
Look...

19:37.599 --> 19:40.734
If you want to cry or talk,

19:40.802 --> 19:43.970
even if you want to play
that song again,

19:44.072 --> 19:46.806
then you go right ahead and do it.

19:46.908 --> 19:47.741
Right, Jimmy?

19:47.843 --> 19:49.609
Yep. Yeah.

19:49.711 --> 19:53.546
We're here for you, so you... play it.

19:53.648 --> 19:54.714
Okay.

20:00.255 --> 20:02.689
You know what, I don't need it.

20:02.758 --> 20:03.823
Oh, thank God.

20:03.925 --> 20:06.927
I said it was okay. It wasn't okay.

20:07.099 --> 20:10.911
- Hey, are you sure?
- Yeah.

20:11.098 --> 20:12.685
But I am gonna Instagram you guys

20:12.786 --> 20:14.601
'cause you made my Valentine's Day.

20:14.703 --> 20:17.203
Wait, uh, is it regular feed
or squirrel feed?

20:17.305 --> 20:18.137
Oh, squirrel feed.

20:18.240 --> 20:19.639
That's where all the good stuff goes.

20:19.741 --> 20:21.908
Oh, you know, I noticed that.

20:22.010 --> 20:23.877
You guys kind of look like a couple.

20:23.979 --> 20:25.144
Yeah, a couple of studs.

20:25.247 --> 20:26.045
[Both chuckle]

20:26.147 --> 20:27.113
No, like a couple.

20:27.215 --> 20:29.015
Like, you're even wearing the same coat.

20:32.549 --> 20:35.484
- More wine?
- Of course.

20:43.394 --> 20:44.626
To Valentine's Day.

20:44.728 --> 20:49.064
You know, I get it.
This place is very peaceful.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.718
Does anybody know
where they keep the rakes?

20:52.002 --> 20:54.039
They're having a two-pack special.

20:54.132 --> 20:55.637
Please get me out of here.

20:55.706 --> 20:58.781
You're gonna have to wait 20 minutes.
I'm getting my tires changed.

20:59.305 --> 21:05.919
