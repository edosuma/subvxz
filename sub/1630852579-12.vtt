00:02.000 --> 00:04.000
NARRATOR:
An incredible eyewitness account

00:04.125 --> 00:06.667
of unidentified flying objects.

00:06.833 --> 00:10.458
It wasn't just, uh, one light,
it was a series of lights.

00:10.583 --> 00:15.458
NARRATOR:
A sensational report
of an alien crash.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.583
They had the debris out here
in the hangar area.

00:18.708 --> 00:23.333
NARRATOR:
Ancient depictions
of extraterrestrial visitation.

00:23.458 --> 00:25.125
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
I'm arguing that what

00:25.250 --> 00:29.000
we are looking at here is
someone visiting from the sky.

00:29.167 --> 00:31.292
NARRATOR:
For more than a decade,

00:31.375 --> 00:35.583
<i>Ancient Aliens</i> has followed
investigators across the globe

00:35.708 --> 00:39.167
as they've gone directly
to the sites where unusual,

00:39.292 --> 00:43.958
unexpected and unexplained
incidents have been reported.

00:44.042 --> 00:46.375
Now we take a look back

00:46.500 --> 00:49.792
at the most
extraordinary encounters.

00:49.917 --> 00:53.000
Encounters that, according
to ancient astronaut theorists,

00:53.125 --> 00:56.000
reveal overwhelming evidence

00:56.083 --> 00:59.417
of an extraterrestrial
presence on Earth.

01:00.708 --> 01:02.750
♪ ♪

01:15.667 --> 01:18.625
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we've traveled around the world

01:18.708 --> 01:22.333
investigating extraordinary
encounters with UFOs,

01:22.500 --> 01:26.000
strange beings and other
unexplainable phenomena.

01:26.167 --> 01:29.333
But make no mistake,
alien encounters

01:29.500 --> 01:32.292
are not simply
a modern-day occurrence.

01:32.417 --> 01:35.333
They've been happening
for thousands of years.

01:35.500 --> 01:37.500
And when I visited
the Mediterranean island

01:37.625 --> 01:40.833
of Sardinia, I found some
of the most compelling evidence

01:41.000 --> 01:43.458
that I've ever seen.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.792
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut
theorist Giorgio Tsoukalos

01:51.875 --> 01:54.958
is meeting Oak Island
treasure hunter Marty Lagina

01:55.042 --> 01:57.625
to explore the island's
mysterious legends

01:57.708 --> 01:59.500
of otherworldly visitors.

01:59.625 --> 02:00.917
Giorgio!

02:01.042 --> 02:03.250
-Hey.
-How crazy is this place?

02:03.375 --> 02:05.083
-Isn't this something?
-So great to meet you here

02:05.208 --> 02:06.583
-in Sardinia.
-Great to meet...

02:06.708 --> 02:08.667
NARRATOR:
To begin their investigation,

02:08.792 --> 02:11.167
Giorgio and Marty travel

02:11.250 --> 02:13.667
to the National Archaeological
Museum in Cagliari,

02:13.792 --> 02:16.833
where some of Sardinia's
oldest and strangest artifacts

02:16.958 --> 02:19.417
are on display.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.250
TSOUKALOS:
It's just all weird.

02:21.375 --> 02:24.500
He's got a helmet on,
those weird eyes.

02:24.667 --> 02:26.333
NARRATOR: Featured in
the museum's collection

02:26.458 --> 02:29.167
are a number
of enormous stone statues

02:29.250 --> 02:32.167
known as the Giants
of Mont'e Prama.

02:32.292 --> 02:35.750
They were first
discovered in 1974

02:35.875 --> 02:39.250
when a local farmer stumbled
upon a large carved stone

02:39.375 --> 02:41.125
protruding from the ground.

02:41.208 --> 02:44.500
Archaeologists quickly
took over the site,

02:44.625 --> 02:49.250
recovering more than
5,000 broken remnants.

02:49.375 --> 02:53.292
Mainstream historians suggest
the statues were carved

02:53.417 --> 02:56.458
by the Nuragic people,
a civilization

02:56.583 --> 02:59.000
that is believed
to have inhabited the island

02:59.125 --> 03:03.750
for 2,000 years,
emerging in 1800 BC

03:03.875 --> 03:08.083
and mysteriously disappearing
around 200 AD.

03:08.208 --> 03:12.208
But what also makes
the statues so mysterious

03:12.375 --> 03:16.167
is the strange way
in which the faces are carved.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.500
Not so much resembling humans,

03:18.625 --> 03:21.833
but what some might describe
as robots.

03:23.833 --> 03:26.500
JASON OSEQUEDA:
The giant statues found
at Mont'e Prama

03:26.583 --> 03:29.667
were approximately seven
and a half to eight feet tall.

03:29.792 --> 03:34.167
You have warriors
and boxers and archers.

03:34.292 --> 03:37.667
The statues themselves
are just noted for their size,

03:37.833 --> 03:40.917
and it's thought that they
represent the Nuragic people,

03:41.042 --> 03:46.000
that this is actually what we
might have that looks like them.

03:46.167 --> 03:49.833
LAGINA:
If he's a model of that,
why doesn't he have disc eyes?

03:49.958 --> 03:53.667
Because he doesn't have disc
eyes, and he certainly could.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.500
What I find intriguing is
that the Giants of Mont'e Prama,

03:56.625 --> 03:59.333
although they were
discovered in the 1970s,

03:59.458 --> 04:04.375
were not put on display until
sometime near the year 2000.

04:04.500 --> 04:08.458
And I believe that these
statues simply do not conform

04:08.542 --> 04:10.625
to the conventional
archaeological narrative

04:10.708 --> 04:14.333
on the island,
and instead point to the reality

04:14.417 --> 04:16.833
that there was something
very unusual

04:16.917 --> 04:18.417
happening on this island.

04:18.542 --> 04:22.667
This is very human,
except it has weird eyes...

04:22.792 --> 04:24.958
-TSOUKALOS: And
disproportioned, uh...
-And disproportions.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.333
ANDREW COLLINS: When you look
at these stone figurines,

04:27.500 --> 04:30.792
they are extremely peculiar,
and they give the impression

04:30.875 --> 04:32.542
of actually being giants.

04:32.708 --> 04:35.958
The strange thing
about the statues

04:36.042 --> 04:40.583
is that they have these
very strange circular eyes

04:40.708 --> 04:44.583
that almost give them
an otherworldly feel.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.667
NARRATOR:
After their visit to the museum,

04:47.833 --> 04:50.417
Giorgio and Marty
meet at a nearby restaurant

04:50.542 --> 04:53.417
with archaeological tour guide
Maria Paola Loi...

04:53.542 --> 04:56.167
-TSOUKALOS: Paola?
-...who has offered
to share with them

04:56.292 --> 04:58.333
some of Sardinians'
local legends.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.208
How are you? Ciao.
Pleased to meet you.

05:00.375 --> 05:02.458
-Welcome to Sardinia.
<i>-Piacere. Grazie.</i>

05:02.583 --> 05:05.292
-Fantastic. Okay.
-So-- Yeah.

05:05.417 --> 05:07.542
-Did you go to the museum? Oh.
-MARTY: We did.

05:07.667 --> 05:10.417
Yeah, tell me what you think
about the finds

05:10.542 --> 05:12.583
that are displayed there.

05:12.708 --> 05:14.833
I mean, up until
about six months ago,

05:14.917 --> 05:17.833
-I had no idea
about these statues here.
-No idea, huh?

05:17.958 --> 05:20.333
So now, when I saw

05:20.500 --> 05:22.792
these statues of the Giganti
for the first time,

05:22.917 --> 05:26.667
not only did the eyes
remind me of, uh, C-3PO

05:26.792 --> 05:29.667
-from <i>Star Wars,</i> but also...
-LAGINA: They did, right.

05:29.792 --> 05:34.750
...there are these giant-eyed
statues in Tell Asmar,

05:34.875 --> 05:39.000
from the ancient Sumerian
and Babylonian times.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.458
LOI:
Originally,

05:40.583 --> 05:43.500
the archeologists,
and also scholars,

05:43.625 --> 05:45.792
uh, who mentioned
the Nuragic civilization

05:45.875 --> 05:49.500
said that these people probably
arrived from Mesopotamia.

05:50.292 --> 05:52.917
-So the Anunnakis?
-Right.

05:53.042 --> 05:55.167
NARRATOR:
The Anunnaki?

05:55.292 --> 05:57.500
The race of winged giants
as described

05:57.583 --> 06:01.208
in ancient Sumerian texts,
and frequently depicted

06:01.333 --> 06:04.083
on the temples and icons
of ancient Babylon?

06:04.208 --> 06:06.333
COLLINS:
There are a lot of connections

06:06.458 --> 06:09.500
between the Sardinian language,

06:09.667 --> 06:13.083
uh, and the different languages
of Mesopotamia.

06:13.208 --> 06:17.625
Suggesting that-that Sumerians
did actually come to Sardinia.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.833
They would've brought with them
the traditions

06:20.958 --> 06:25.333
to do with the Anunnaki,
the gods of heaven and Earth,

06:25.458 --> 06:29.000
uh, which many people believe
were celestial beings.

06:32.375 --> 06:35.833
NARRATOR:
Might the mysterious giants of
Mont'e Prama have been inspired

06:35.958 --> 06:40.792
by encounters
with extraterrestrial visitors?

06:40.917 --> 06:44.583
Ancient astronaut theorists
not only say yes,

06:44.708 --> 06:47.458
but they believe that dozens
of carved stones

06:47.583 --> 06:50.833
found scattered across Sardinia
known as menhirs

06:50.958 --> 06:56.417
tell the story of how these
beings arrived on planet Earth.

06:56.542 --> 06:59.708
During their trip, Giorgio
and Marty arranged to meet

06:59.833 --> 07:02.500
with archeological guide
Ivana Malu

07:02.583 --> 07:04.500
-at the Menhir Museum
in Laconi...
-Wow.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.792
...to get an up close look

07:06.917 --> 07:09.625
at some of these strange
standing stones.

07:09.708 --> 07:14.292
IVANA MALU:
Look at the very strange circle
with the spear.

07:14.417 --> 07:16.417
What do you think, Marty?
What is that?

07:16.542 --> 07:18.000
I'm not sure what that is
and I'm not sure

07:18.125 --> 07:19.458
what this is, either.

07:19.583 --> 07:22.833
Now, you tell me, please,
what should I be seeing?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.792
It's a guy going down.

07:26.500 --> 07:28.125
-To go into another dimension.
-Mm.

07:28.208 --> 07:32.167
MALU:
Do not ask me where,
or which other world.

07:32.292 --> 07:34.542
But he's going on a trip,
on a journey,

07:34.667 --> 07:37.000
going from point A to point B.

07:37.083 --> 07:41.833
Whatever it really symbolizes,
it was very important.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.542
This took an enormous
amount of work,

07:43.708 --> 07:45.167
just this-- I mean,
it's very heavy,

07:45.333 --> 07:48.417
it-it's done in relief, which
is the hard way to do a carving.

07:48.542 --> 07:50.167
TSOUKALOS:
I-I think it's, uh...

07:50.250 --> 07:51.917
What do you think
that represents?

07:52.042 --> 07:54.792
TSOUKALOS:
We have people with two wings
on each side.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.333
You know, it's almost like
an early version

07:56.417 --> 07:58.917
of some type of an angel.

07:59.042 --> 08:02.833
I'm arguing that what we
are looking at here

08:03.000 --> 08:06.208
is someone visiting
from the sky.

08:06.375 --> 08:08.875
You know what I find
beyond fascinating

08:09.042 --> 08:11.833
is this shape down here,

08:12.000 --> 08:14.500
which mainstream
archaeology suggests

08:14.667 --> 08:17.667
is some type of a weapon,
some type of a dagger.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.458
Which makes perfect sense.

08:20.583 --> 08:24.500
But in conjunction
with this symbol right here,

08:24.667 --> 08:28.583
and that, one could argue
that this is a representation

08:28.708 --> 08:32.500
of some type
of misunderstood technology

08:32.667 --> 08:36.292
that illustrates
some type of a flying craft.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.208
-Fascinating.

08:38.375 --> 08:40.833
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the imagery

08:41.000 --> 08:43.667
carved onto the menhirs
of Sardinia,

08:43.750 --> 08:46.667
as well as the stone
giants of Mont'e Prama,

08:46.792 --> 08:51.375
tell a story of extraterrestrial
visitation in the distant past,

08:51.542 --> 08:55.375
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

08:55.500 --> 08:58.500
And if so, could these
mysterious figures

08:58.667 --> 09:01.250
be the same beings
that some people believe

09:01.375 --> 09:04.667
are visiting mankind today?

09:04.792 --> 09:06.833
Perhaps further clues
can be found

09:06.958 --> 09:12.833
by examining a modern-day report
of a crashed UFO.

09:17.875 --> 09:18.958
When it comes to extraordinary
encounters,

09:19.042 --> 09:20.667
TSOUKALOS:
When this light appeared,
did it seem to you

09:20.750 --> 09:23.333
we are living in the most
exciting time,

09:23.458 --> 09:25.792
because governments all around
the world are finally admitting

09:25.875 --> 09:28.792
that there are
unidentified aerial phenomena

09:28.875 --> 09:31.833
that simply have
no conventional explanation.

09:31.958 --> 09:34.167
But this hasn't
always been the case.

09:34.292 --> 09:37.667
And when I visited the site
of a UAP report in Wales,

09:37.792 --> 09:39.708
I was completely blown away

09:39.875 --> 09:43.208
by what the government
tried to cover up.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.708
NARRATOR:
Late in the evening,

09:53.833 --> 09:56.583
this quiet rural village
in the Berwyn Mountains

09:56.708 --> 10:00.292
is rocked
by an enormous explosion.

10:01.708 --> 10:05.708
14-year-old Huw Lloyd is
in his home watching television

10:05.875 --> 10:08.208
when he feels the impact,

10:08.375 --> 10:11.333
and then receives call
after call from his neighbors,

10:11.458 --> 10:15.042
most claiming to have seen
an incredibly bright light

10:15.167 --> 10:19.958
falling from the sky and then
glowing on the mountainside.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.500
Today, Huw Lloyd still works

10:25.583 --> 10:27.625
on his father's ranch
in Llandrillo.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.833
-Are you Huw?
-LLOYD: Yep.

10:30.958 --> 10:32.792
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

10:32.917 --> 10:35.833
and Nick Pope,
a former UFO investigator

10:35.958 --> 10:38.750
for the British
Ministry of Defence,

10:38.875 --> 10:40.500
met up with Huw to get his take

10:40.667 --> 10:43.667
on what really happened
that night.

10:43.792 --> 10:45.750
Can you tell us your experience?

11:06.917 --> 11:08.917
Your neighbors called you
to ask you if you're okay.

11:09.042 --> 11:11.875
So, they pretty much
had similar experiences?

11:13.083 --> 11:15.125
So you're not the only one?

11:15.208 --> 11:17.625
And what time
of evening was this?

11:19.667 --> 11:21.833
So, you know,
some people have suggested

11:22.000 --> 11:24.125
that, well, it was nothing else
but an earthquake.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.833
-Yeah.
-Which, I don't
subscribe to this idea,

11:25.958 --> 11:29.000
but have you had
any earthquakes around here?

11:40.292 --> 11:44.208
But you saw that light,
and it was much, much brighter

11:44.333 --> 11:46.625
than people lamping.

11:46.750 --> 11:48.917
I mean, it was something
almost blinding?

11:52.583 --> 11:53.667
Wow.

11:55.208 --> 11:56.708
NARRATOR:
The community of Llandrillo

11:56.875 --> 11:59.167
was shaken
by the mysterious event,

11:59.292 --> 12:03.833
which became known as
the Berwyn Mountains incident.

12:03.958 --> 12:06.375
That night, dozens of residents

12:06.500 --> 12:08.333
called the region's
emergency line

12:08.458 --> 12:11.833
to report a bright light
followed by a mysterious object

12:11.958 --> 12:15.042
seen streaking
across the night sky.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.333
Curiously,
approximately 30 minutes

12:18.458 --> 12:20.500
after the reports were made,

12:20.625 --> 12:25.250
a police officer arrived at the
home of eyewitness Huw Lloyd.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.042
-Right, so a senior officer.
-Yeah.

12:41.208 --> 12:43.708
-Not-not one of the local...
-Mm-mm, no.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.792
NARRATOR:
A plane crash?

12:49.875 --> 12:52.542
For Nick Pope, who worked
at the Ministry of Defence

12:52.708 --> 12:55.333
and has seen the file
on this incident,

12:55.458 --> 12:58.333
this is a surprising new detail.

12:58.417 --> 13:01.458
The official report
only mentions a meteor,

13:01.583 --> 13:04.708
and nothing about a plane.

13:04.833 --> 13:08.667
The theory initially
that this was a plane crash,

13:08.792 --> 13:11.625
and that this police
and military operation

13:11.750 --> 13:13.250
was a search and rescue...

13:13.375 --> 13:15.167
-Yeah.
-...or search and recovery,
that's fine.

13:15.292 --> 13:18.500
But I mean, you know,
we know where our planes are.

13:18.583 --> 13:22.500
There is 24/7 radar coverage,

13:22.583 --> 13:24.500
-civilian aircraft to carry...
-Even back then.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.083
Yeah, a-absolutely.

13:26.208 --> 13:28.667
Planes don't just drop
out of the sky.

13:28.792 --> 13:30.250
And-and if they do,

13:30.375 --> 13:32.708
immediately, everyone knows
which aircraft it is.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.042
So it seems odd.

13:49.167 --> 13:51.125
NARRATOR:
The officer commandeered
the family's truck

13:51.250 --> 13:54.667
and drove with Huw
to the crash site.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.875
Nick and Giorgio were taken

13:57.000 --> 14:00.167
on the exact same journey
that was made that night.

14:00.292 --> 14:02.458
POPE:
How high is the mountain?

14:05.750 --> 14:07.667
You know,
one thing that struck me

14:07.792 --> 14:10.875
is this is a pretty
difficult drive.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.917
So you've got to be
pretty determined

14:13.042 --> 14:15.000
to get a whole bunch
of people up here.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.125
TSOUKALOS:
Yes, and for what purpose?

14:17.208 --> 14:20.458
Unless it's really
something of importance.

14:20.542 --> 14:21.750
POPE:
Yeah, this-this is not

14:21.875 --> 14:24.917
-to be undertaken
lightly, is it?
-No. No.

14:25.042 --> 14:27.792
NARRATOR:
According to Huw,
the police inspector

14:27.875 --> 14:30.000
directed him to stop
at this spot,

14:30.167 --> 14:32.958
although the inspector
was allegedly not familiar

14:33.042 --> 14:36.750
with the area and seemed
to have no reason for doing so.

14:36.875 --> 14:39.958
It was at this location
that he witnessed

14:40.042 --> 14:42.458
an incredibly bright light
in the distance.

14:42.542 --> 14:45.333
So, down there?

14:45.417 --> 14:46.500
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.792
TSOUKALOS:
When this light appeared,

14:57.875 --> 15:01.375
did it seem to you
as if it was an explosion?

15:06.083 --> 15:08.417
POPE:
And how long was it shining for?

15:12.292 --> 15:16.333
NARRATOR:
According to Huw, the inspector
wanted to get a closer look

15:16.458 --> 15:18.292
at the mysterious light,

15:18.417 --> 15:22.167
but then received a curious
command from his superiors.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.292
So, it sounds like
it was a "stand down" call.

15:47.042 --> 15:48.583
POPE:
Yes.

15:52.167 --> 15:54.125
NARRATOR:
In the days
following the incident,

15:54.250 --> 15:58.125
Royal Air Force personnel,
scientists, journalists

15:58.208 --> 16:01.250
and UFO enthusiasts
combed the surrounding land

16:01.375 --> 16:04.042
and interviewed locals
at length.

16:06.042 --> 16:08.833
Curiously, the official
explanation for these events

16:09.000 --> 16:11.167
provided by the Ministry
of Defence

16:11.292 --> 16:14.833
did not include either
fox hunters or a plane crash,

16:14.958 --> 16:17.917
as was told to Huw that night.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.167
And the story they did provide

16:21.250 --> 16:24.625
involves an incredible
coincidence.

16:26.042 --> 16:29.792
The story is apparently
that there was an earthquake

16:29.875 --> 16:31.500
that hit the village.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.875
But at the same time,

16:35.000 --> 16:37.958
there was a bright
fireball meteor

16:38.042 --> 16:41.667
breaking up
in the Earth's atmosphere.

16:41.792 --> 16:44.083
So, not one extraordinary event,

16:44.208 --> 16:47.167
but two at exactly
the same time.

16:47.250 --> 16:51.958
Over the years, the UFO
community has become convinced

16:52.042 --> 16:55.167
that this was indeed
a UFO crash,

16:55.292 --> 16:58.958
that the military launched
a secret operation

16:59.042 --> 17:01.167
to secure the crash site,

17:01.333 --> 17:04.417
to recover
the wreckage and maybe bodies,

17:04.542 --> 17:07.000
and to take it
to a secure facility.

17:10.125 --> 17:13.625
NARRATOR:
More than four decades since
the Berwyn Mountains incident,

17:13.708 --> 17:16.583
the residents of Llandrillo
are still convinced

17:16.708 --> 17:19.250
that the British government
is hiding the truth

17:19.375 --> 17:22.750
about what really happened
that night.

17:22.875 --> 17:27.542
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

17:27.708 --> 17:30.792
it is part of a global effort
to keep the public in the dark

17:30.917 --> 17:33.542
about alien activity on Earth,

17:33.667 --> 17:37.042
and it all started
after the U.S. Army itself

17:37.208 --> 17:40.542
reported the crash
of a flying saucer.

17:45.417 --> 17:47.125
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have covered

17:47.208 --> 17:49.333
some pretty incredible
encounters,

17:49.458 --> 17:51.875
including the most
famous of all,

17:52.000 --> 17:54.417
the Roswell incident
in New Mexico.

17:54.542 --> 17:57.375
And one of the most exciting
places I've ever visited

17:57.500 --> 18:00.000
was the airplane hangar
where some say

18:00.083 --> 18:04.083
the wreckage from
the Roswell crash was taken.

18:04.208 --> 18:09.625
NARRATOR:
Washington, D.C., April 2011.

18:09.750 --> 18:11.792
The FBI releases

18:11.875 --> 18:16.125
thousands of files as part
of its online FBI Vault.

18:16.250 --> 18:19.375
One particular file
draws the attention

18:19.500 --> 18:22.583
of the media
and independent researchers.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.750
The memo, dated March 22, 1950,

18:27.875 --> 18:30.917
is a briefing to FBI Director
J. Edgar Hoover

18:31.042 --> 18:35.500
regarding informant information
about three "flying saucers"

18:35.583 --> 18:38.625
that were recovered
in New Mexico.

18:40.375 --> 18:43.375
Investigators immediately
connect the memo

18:43.542 --> 18:46.167
to the infamous
Roswell incident,

18:46.292 --> 18:49.292
a purported UFO crash
that many people believe

18:49.375 --> 18:52.625
was covered up
by the military in 1947.

18:55.167 --> 18:58.875
But this document is just
the latest in a series

18:59.042 --> 19:02.708
of government files that have
been released in recent years,

19:02.833 --> 19:05.958
suggesting there may be more
to the Roswell crash

19:06.083 --> 19:09.833
than the public was told.

19:09.958 --> 19:14.250
As an investigative reporter,
I think what I am amazed by

19:14.375 --> 19:18.625
is how many leaked documents
from the 1940s

19:18.708 --> 19:22.208
have actually come out
into the world,

19:22.333 --> 19:26.250
and lay out details about
what really happened at Roswell.

19:29.292 --> 19:33.917
On July 4th,
a rancher named Mac Brazel

19:34.042 --> 19:37.750
finds all kinds
of strange silver debris.

19:37.875 --> 19:42.583
He knows he doesn't understand
what he's walking through.

19:42.708 --> 19:46.333
He decides to go into Roswell
and tell the sheriff,

19:46.417 --> 19:48.833
"Something has crashed
on my ranch."

19:50.542 --> 19:53.958
Intel coming out
of Roswell Army Airfield

19:54.042 --> 19:56.750
get assigned to go
to the debris field.

19:56.875 --> 19:59.667
And these men are told
that they are to pick up

19:59.750 --> 20:02.208
every single thing
that is in the debris field

20:02.333 --> 20:04.417
on the Mac Brazel ranch.

20:04.542 --> 20:06.833
Everything is to be picked up.

20:08.917 --> 20:11.958
NARRATOR:
On July 8, 1947,

20:12.042 --> 20:15.875
the headline on the front page
of the <i>Roswell Daily Record</i>

20:16.000 --> 20:19.958
reports that the military had
retrieved a flying saucer.

20:22.208 --> 20:25.000
But the following day,
the official story

20:25.125 --> 20:27.667
is suddenly changed to suggest

20:27.750 --> 20:30.708
it was nothing more
than a failed weather balloon.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.042
POPE:
Roswell was the home

20:34.208 --> 20:36.500
of the 509th Bomb Crew.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.667
This was the only
atomic bomb-capable squadron

20:39.792 --> 20:41.083
anywhere in the world.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.833
These people were
the best of the best.

20:44.667 --> 20:48.292
The idea that intelligence
personnel at this base

20:48.375 --> 20:52.792
would mistake a weather balloon
for something exotic

20:52.875 --> 20:54.917
is preposterous.

20:55.042 --> 21:00.708
So that, arguably, is the start
of the UFO cover-up.

21:00.833 --> 21:03.500
The world was told,
"Nope, just a weather balloon."

21:03.583 --> 21:07.500
And for more than 30 years,
that's where it was left,

21:07.583 --> 21:11.500
until witnesses
started to surface,

21:11.583 --> 21:14.167
saying, "No, it was actually
an extraterrestrial craft."

21:14.292 --> 21:16.750
And people saw alien bodies.

21:21.625 --> 21:24.625
NARRATOR:
In April of 2014,

21:24.708 --> 21:27.708
ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

21:27.875 --> 21:30.083
traveled to the Roswell
International Air Center

21:30.208 --> 21:31.583
in New Mexico

21:31.708 --> 21:34.417
to meet with the city's mayor,
Del Jurney,

21:34.542 --> 21:36.833
and to get a rare look
at the hanger

21:36.958 --> 21:40.000
where the Roswell wreckage
and extraterrestrial bodies

21:40.125 --> 21:42.375
were allegedly first taken.

21:48.208 --> 21:50.375
Wow.

21:50.542 --> 21:51.542
-So...
-This is huge.

21:51.708 --> 21:53.708
JURNEY:
So what do you think?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.917
TSOUKALOS:
Man, I have goose bumps
right now.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.292
I mean,
we're walking on history.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.875
JURNEY:
It's amazing, isn't it?

21:59.000 --> 22:00.625
Are you, are you familiar
with where the spot is?

22:00.708 --> 22:02.167
-Where they actually put them?
-Well, y-you know,

22:02.292 --> 22:03.833
the information that I have

22:03.917 --> 22:05.458
says that it's probably
right over here in the corner.

22:05.583 --> 22:06.708
Uh, they took them over there,

22:06.875 --> 22:08.833
did an examination
of the bodies.

22:11.208 --> 22:12.417
TSOUKALOS:
So this is where it was.

22:12.542 --> 22:13.708
JURNEY:
This is it. Yeah, come on in.

22:18.375 --> 22:19.667
They had the debris
out here in the hangar area

22:19.792 --> 22:22.917
and they bring
the bodies inside this room.

22:25.042 --> 22:26.333
TSOUKALOS:
I-I really don't know
what to say,

22:26.500 --> 22:28.333
'cause, I mean,
if this was it...

22:28.458 --> 22:29.750
-You're standing where...
-Yeah, yeah.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.250
...where extraterrestrial
beings...

22:32.375 --> 22:34.458
-TSOUKALOS: Were.
-...might have been.

22:37.375 --> 22:39.875
Where did the debris go?
Where did it end up?

22:40.000 --> 22:42.292
Well, it ended up
with the government, of course.

22:42.375 --> 22:44.208
My understanding
is that they took the bodies

22:44.333 --> 22:46.250
to Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base,

22:46.375 --> 22:48.167
certainly, probably
took the debris as well,

22:48.292 --> 22:53.083
and have it well-preserved in a
military installation someplace.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.833
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

22:56.958 --> 23:00.542
that an alien craft
really did crash in Roswell,

23:00.708 --> 23:03.458
and was covered up
by the U.S. government,

23:03.542 --> 23:07.833
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

23:07.958 --> 23:10.667
Perhaps such encounters
are harder to ignore

23:10.750 --> 23:15.750
when the witness is running for
president of the United States.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.625
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have examined

23:23.708 --> 23:25.292
the most extraordinary
encounters on record,

23:25.417 --> 23:27.292
and believe it or not,
there are thousands

23:27.417 --> 23:31.167
of new UFO sightings
reported every year.

23:31.292 --> 23:33.417
Of course,
skeptics dismiss these accounts

23:33.542 --> 23:36.833
as misinterpretations
or outright hoaxes,

23:36.958 --> 23:39.500
but on one episode
of <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

23:39.625 --> 23:42.458
Nick Pope investigated
a UFO sighting

23:42.542 --> 23:46.000
made by a witness
who's as credible as it gets,

23:46.125 --> 23:49.000
because this witness went
public with his encounter

23:49.167 --> 23:53.375
while running for president
of the United States.

23:59.542 --> 24:03.750
NARRATOR:
During the Democratic primary
debate at Drexel University,

24:03.875 --> 24:06.167
moderator Tim Russert
turns and addresses

24:06.333 --> 24:09.167
presidential candidate
Dennis Kucinich.

24:09.333 --> 24:11.333
TIM RUSSERT:
Congressman Kucinich,
a serious question.

24:11.458 --> 24:14.542
Shirley MacLaine
writes in her new book

24:14.667 --> 24:19.000
that you sighted a UFO over
her home in Washington state,

24:19.125 --> 24:22.292
that you found the encounter
extremely moving,

24:22.375 --> 24:24.417
that it was a triangular craft.

24:24.542 --> 24:27.875
Now, did you see a UFO?

24:28.000 --> 24:31.125
Uh, I did, and, uh,
the rest of the account...

24:31.208 --> 24:32.583
-(laughter)
-Oh, I-I didn't, I--

24:32.708 --> 24:34.583
It was an unidentified
flying object, okay?

24:34.708 --> 24:36.500
It's like, it's unidentified.
I saw something.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.708
Now... And also,
you have to keep in mind

24:38.875 --> 24:42.375
that more,
that Jimmy Carter saw a UFO,

24:42.542 --> 24:45.042
and also, that more people
in this country,

24:45.167 --> 24:47.458
uh, uh, have seen UFOs

24:47.542 --> 24:50.083
than I think approve
of George Bush's presidency.

24:50.208 --> 24:54.375
NARRATOR:
The debate moment
made national headlines.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.917
While Kucinich
was not a front-runner,

24:57.042 --> 25:00.083
many political commentators
proposed that this admission

25:00.208 --> 25:05.208
undoubtedly had a negative
impact on his campaign.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.958
JOHN PODESTA:
I think, for most people,

25:07.042 --> 25:11.000
it's been the notion that
you are even discussing UFOs

25:11.125 --> 25:13.667
tends to be viewed
as a career ender.

25:13.833 --> 25:16.667
You know, people think
you're a little bit whacky

25:16.792 --> 25:19.708
if you're, uh, taking
the phenomena seriously.

25:19.833 --> 25:23.250
NARRATOR:
But just what did
Dennis Kucinich experience?

25:29.792 --> 25:32.167
Former British Ministry
of Defence

25:32.250 --> 25:34.292
UFO investigator Nick Pope

25:34.417 --> 25:36.833
has arranged to meet
with Dennis Kucinich

25:36.958 --> 25:40.708
at the location
of his 1982 UFO encounter,

25:40.833 --> 25:43.583
the former home
of Academy Award-winning actress

25:43.708 --> 25:45.625
Shirley MacLaine.

25:45.750 --> 25:49.458
The home, which has since been
sold, overlooks Mount Rainier,

25:49.542 --> 25:52.250
the site of the infamous
Kenneth Arnold

25:52.375 --> 25:53.542
flying saucer incident

25:53.667 --> 25:58.000
that ignited
the UFO craze in 1947.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.583
-Hey there, welcome.
-KUCINICH: Hi.
-POPE: Hi.

26:00.708 --> 26:03.375
NARRATOR:
The current owner agreed
to allow Nick and Dennis

26:03.500 --> 26:05.167
to take a look around.

26:05.333 --> 26:07.750
-HOMEOWNER: Come on in.
-Go ahead.
-Thank you.

26:07.875 --> 26:09.333
-Wow.
-Yeah, really.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.542
(both chuckle)

26:11.667 --> 26:13.625
-POPE: What a fabulous view.
-KUCINICH: Oh, look,

26:13.708 --> 26:15.500
-there's nothing like this.
-This is, of course,

26:15.583 --> 26:19.083
the location where
you had your UFO sighting.

26:19.208 --> 26:21.000
Can you tell me about it?

26:21.083 --> 26:23.542
Well, uh, Nick,
I was seated at a dinner table

26:23.667 --> 26:25.750
with myself and two friends,

26:25.875 --> 26:28.542
and I noticed a-a light
in the distance.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.625
Came from a hill
directly over the house.

26:30.708 --> 26:32.792
-Come on, let me show you.
-Okay.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.792
-Wow, fabulous.
-So I was standing out here,

26:34.875 --> 26:37.125
the-the scope was here.

26:37.250 --> 26:39.542
I-I brought it up here...

26:41.458 --> 26:44.625
...so that I could
get a look at the light.

26:44.708 --> 26:46.000
And when I looked at it,
I saw that it wasn't just,

26:46.167 --> 26:48.333
uh, one light,
it was a series of lights,

26:48.458 --> 26:51.958
like a grid,
one stacked on another.

26:52.083 --> 26:54.417
I went back and I looked,
and then I saw something

26:54.542 --> 26:55.917
that was extraordinary.

26:56.042 --> 26:58.792
I-I said,
"The lights were separating."

26:58.917 --> 27:00.500
They were definitely
moving in this direction.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.625
So at that point,
came right to the edge here

27:02.750 --> 27:06.167
and I looked out
into the hills to watch

27:06.292 --> 27:09.625
what proved to be three crafts
moving in this direction.

27:09.750 --> 27:12.667
Just to be clear,
first seen over there,

27:12.792 --> 27:15.667
-to directly over the house.
-Right.

27:15.792 --> 27:18.250
Right in the hills
in the distance,

27:18.375 --> 27:21.125
and then in a straight line.

27:21.208 --> 27:25.458
That straight line would
just go right overhead here.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.708
And then above the house.

27:27.833 --> 27:29.708
And then, and then, quickly...

27:29.875 --> 27:32.417
-POPE: Right, and then "whoosh."
-...accelerating out of sight.

27:32.542 --> 27:34.292
Just like that, gone.

27:34.375 --> 27:36.625
-And that was the last
you saw of them?
-Oh, yeah.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.333
NARRATOR:
The next day, Kucinich
described the experience

27:41.417 --> 27:42.833
to Shirley MacLaine.

27:42.958 --> 27:47.750
He would say nothing more
about it for 26 years.

27:47.875 --> 27:51.375
And then, when running for the
Democratic nomination in 2008,

27:51.542 --> 27:55.167
his private UFO sighting
would become a public event,

27:55.292 --> 28:00.667
affecting presidential politics
in a most unexpected way.

28:00.750 --> 28:02.958
When the question was asked,

28:03.042 --> 28:06.917
I-I think there was mention of,
you know, feeling almost a...

28:07.042 --> 28:10.292
an emotional connection,
that it spoke to you,

28:10.375 --> 28:13.083
I mean, not in a literal sense,
but feelings.

28:13.208 --> 28:15.875
I don't know that I ever
communicated that to anyone,

28:16.000 --> 28:19.542
but I will tell you this: that
it was, it was extraordinary.

28:19.667 --> 28:22.292
It was exciting.
How could it not be?

28:22.375 --> 28:24.625
I mean, anybody who would
see anything like that

28:24.708 --> 28:26.458
would have to be excited,
and was I?

28:26.542 --> 28:28.500
Uh, yeah.

28:28.583 --> 28:33.042
NARRATOR:
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

28:33.167 --> 28:36.292
accounts of UFO sightings
from high-level politicians

28:36.375 --> 28:40.125
like Dennis Kucinich
are particularly intriguing.

28:40.250 --> 28:43.667
Not only is he seen
as a credible witness,

28:43.792 --> 28:46.708
but he was so amazed by
what he saw that he was willing

28:46.833 --> 28:50.292
to risk his political career
to talk about it.

28:50.417 --> 28:53.167
Perhaps the only encounter
more compelling

28:53.292 --> 28:56.292
would be one reported
by multiple witnesses

28:56.375 --> 29:01.083
that involved not a UFO
but an alien entity.

29:06.000 --> 29:08.833
On <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>
we have traveled the globe

29:08.958 --> 29:12.333
investigating reports
of incredible encounters.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.750
And there are some locations
that seem to be hot spots

29:14.875 --> 29:18.042
for strange
and unexplained activity.

29:18.208 --> 29:21.500
In 2020, William Henry
got the rare opportunity

29:21.625 --> 29:25.917
to visit one of these hot spots
where, for hundreds of years,

29:26.042 --> 29:31.208
people have reportedly seen
otherworldly beings.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.875
NARRATOR: Ancient astronaut
theorist William Henry,

29:38.042 --> 29:40.667
along with author
and historian Dustin Naef...

29:40.833 --> 29:44.000
-It's down this path here.
-...set out to explore

29:44.083 --> 29:47.500
a series of underground lava
tubes, known as Pluto's Cave

29:47.667 --> 29:50.583
several miles north
of Mount Shasta.

29:50.708 --> 29:52.333
HENRY:
That is just spectacular.

29:52.500 --> 29:55.583
NARRATOR: It is here
where numerous eyewitnesses

29:55.708 --> 29:58.833
claim to have encountered
mysterious beings,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.875
as well as seen evidence

30:01.000 --> 30:03.542
of possible
interdimensional portals.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.833
Pluto's Cave is one
of several natural wonders,

30:09.000 --> 30:13.083
known as lava tubes,
that crisscross the region.

30:13.208 --> 30:17.500
ROBERT SCHOCH: Mount Shasta
is a volcanic mountain.

30:17.583 --> 30:20.667
So volcanic lava tubes
are formed

30:20.792 --> 30:23.833
when you have fast-flowing lava

30:23.917 --> 30:27.500
and it cools on the surface
of the flow,

30:27.625 --> 30:29.250
so it actually builds a crust,

30:29.375 --> 30:33.125
but the lava continues
to flow in the middle.

30:33.250 --> 30:36.875
And it forms literally a tube.

30:39.583 --> 30:41.292
HENRY:
Check it out, man.

30:42.375 --> 30:44.208
Awesome.

30:45.542 --> 30:48.042
Awesome.

30:50.375 --> 30:52.250
NAEF:
So, almost all
of the mythology and legends

30:52.375 --> 30:54.333
around the place,
it all takes place underground

30:54.458 --> 30:57.958
in the caves and tunnels
which surround the area.

30:58.083 --> 31:00.583
If you were able
to look underground,

31:00.708 --> 31:04.000
you'd just see tunnels radiating
out in every direction.

31:04.125 --> 31:06.958
There are actually
Native-authored stories

31:07.042 --> 31:10.833
that you could travel clear into
Oregon completely underground.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.000
HENRY:
Yeah.

31:13.125 --> 31:15.667
Look at that, Dustin.
That's awesome.

31:15.833 --> 31:17.125
Beautiful skylight.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.500
NAEF:
There's a really big subculture

31:19.625 --> 31:22.625
here in Mount Shasta that has
always believed that these caves

31:22.750 --> 31:26.625
and tunnels
contain a civilization

31:26.750 --> 31:29.792
full of people
just like you and I.

31:29.917 --> 31:32.542
And they come
back and forth through portals

31:32.708 --> 31:34.250
hidden in these caves.

31:34.375 --> 31:37.625
I've had people actually
contact me and tell me

31:37.708 --> 31:40.042
they've seen people
in this very cave

31:40.167 --> 31:42.500
walk right into a wall
and vanish.

31:42.625 --> 31:45.625
What-what were these people
like? What did they look like?

31:45.708 --> 31:47.000
They look just like us.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.375
That's how they're able
to travel back and forth

31:49.500 --> 31:52.583
and mingle with humans.

31:52.708 --> 31:54.250
Wow.

31:56.042 --> 31:57.708
NARRATOR:
One of the most famous reports

31:57.833 --> 32:00.792
of a being emerging
from within Mount Shasta

32:00.875 --> 32:05.000
was made in 1930
by Guy Warren Ballard.

32:05.083 --> 32:08.875
Ballard, a mining engineer
who worked in the area,

32:09.000 --> 32:11.833
claimed he was surveying
the slopes of the mountain

32:11.958 --> 32:16.083
when he encountered
a mysterious glowing figure.

32:16.208 --> 32:20.792
Guy reported that when he was
hiking on Mount Shasta

32:20.875 --> 32:24.333
in the early 1930s,
he encountered

32:24.417 --> 32:27.500
some extraordinary,
mysterious teacher,

32:27.667 --> 32:32.375
which he later identified
as the Ascended Master.

32:32.542 --> 32:36.333
JONATHAN YOUNG:
This is a-a radiant being
dressed in white.

32:36.458 --> 32:39.667
And they get
into a long conversation.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.000
And this teacher, this guru,

32:42.083 --> 32:45.500
this otherworldly
character teaches Ballard

32:45.625 --> 32:47.208
the secrets of enlightenment.

32:47.375 --> 32:50.500
NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

32:50.583 --> 32:53.125
Ballard's description
of a radiant being

32:53.250 --> 32:56.000
is reminiscent of accounts
from ancient times

32:56.167 --> 32:59.500
of similarly luminous figures.

32:59.625 --> 33:02.333
In Irish legend, we learn
of the Tuatha Dé Danann,

33:02.500 --> 33:03.667
or the Tua Dé Dann.

33:03.833 --> 33:06.417
These are luminous
humanoid beings

33:06.542 --> 33:08.833
who are considered
to be beings of immense wisdom

33:09.000 --> 33:11.750
who are also called
the Shining Ones.

33:11.875 --> 33:15.875
NARRATOR:
Similar to the Shining Ones
of the Celtic tradition,

33:16.000 --> 33:19.250
the ancient Sumerian gods
known as the Anunnaki

33:19.375 --> 33:22.250
were also described
as glowing figures.

33:22.375 --> 33:25.958
Might these accounts,
including those made

33:26.042 --> 33:28.708
about Mount Shasta, be true?

33:28.833 --> 33:30.875
If so, can William Henry

33:31.000 --> 33:34.000
find any evidence
to help verify them?

33:34.125 --> 33:36.125
If you look on the USGS charts,

33:36.208 --> 33:38.833
there's an immense
negative magnetic anomaly

33:38.958 --> 33:40.667
that surrounds Mount Shasta.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.583
HENRY:
That's the ley line
they describe here, right?

33:42.708 --> 33:45.208
NAEF:
Yeah, a lot of psychic
and paranormal phenomena

33:45.333 --> 33:48.792
actually occurs in places
that have magnetic anomalies.

33:48.875 --> 33:51.333
And used as a, as a portal

33:51.458 --> 33:55.500
between the inner Earth realm
and the stars?

33:55.583 --> 33:57.167
Yeah, yeah, it...

33:57.292 --> 33:59.125
Anything capable of generating

33:59.208 --> 34:02.042
energy like that
could be a portal.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.458
NARRATOR:
Might the lava tubes found

34:04.583 --> 34:07.333
at the base of Mount Shasta
be the location

34:07.458 --> 34:09.417
where extraterrestrial beings

34:09.542 --> 34:13.125
can travel between planet Earth
and the stars?

34:13.208 --> 34:17.417
And if so, does this explain
the strange sightings

34:17.542 --> 34:21.167
of otherworldly entities
reported in the area?

34:21.292 --> 34:24.250
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

34:24.375 --> 34:26.667
and they believe
that at the site

34:26.792 --> 34:29.083
of another incredible encounter,

34:29.208 --> 34:33.792
undeniable evidence
of alien contact was left behind

34:33.875 --> 34:37.292
by an extraterrestrial
technology.

34:41.833 --> 34:44.875
Of all the unexplained phenomena
we've investigated

34:45.042 --> 34:46.667
on <i>Ancient Aliens,</i>

34:46.833 --> 34:50.333
the formation of crop circles
is simply baffling.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.833
Crop circles have been reported
in over 50 different countries

34:53.000 --> 34:56.917
and on every continent
except Antarctica.

34:57.042 --> 34:58.667
And one night
in Wiltshire, England,

34:58.792 --> 35:01.375
two people believe
they actually witnessed

35:01.500 --> 35:04.958
a strange formation
being created by something

35:05.083 --> 35:08.333
that was not human.

35:13.708 --> 35:18.208
NARRATOR:
Local paralegal and crop circle
researcher Gary King

35:18.333 --> 35:21.250
spends the night
camping out on Knap Hill,

35:21.375 --> 35:24.708
an area known for sightings
of mysterious orbs

35:24.875 --> 35:27.583
and other strange occurrences.

35:28.333 --> 35:30.500
It was the 7th of July 2007,

35:30.625 --> 35:33.833
so because it was kind of
an auspicious date, the 7-7-7,

35:33.958 --> 35:35.458
we decided we'd come here.

35:35.583 --> 35:37.167
I came here with my girlfriend
to do a night watch.

35:37.292 --> 35:39.500
So we arrived here and
about 3:00 in the morning,

35:39.583 --> 35:41.208
we had a big white
flash of light,

35:41.333 --> 35:42.875
which completely
encompassed the sky.

35:43.000 --> 35:46.000
And about 20 minutes after that,
we looked and we could see

35:46.167 --> 35:48.208
this crop circle
laid out in front of us.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.542
The field it appeared in
was this field,

35:52.667 --> 35:54.333
here to the right,
that's yellow now.

35:54.500 --> 35:55.958
It was actually in wheat
the year that it occurred,

35:56.083 --> 35:58.083
but they rotate the crops.

35:58.208 --> 36:00.875
And it started from way back
at near those trees,

36:01.000 --> 36:02.333
and came over the brow
of this hill.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.250
It was absolutely enormous.

36:05.375 --> 36:06.833
NARRATOR:
The crop formation

36:06.958 --> 36:10.292
extended 1,033 feet long

36:10.375 --> 36:14.125
and 490 feet wide.

36:14.208 --> 36:16.333
The over two-acre design

36:16.417 --> 36:19.708
contained
150 individual circles,

36:19.833 --> 36:25.000
the largest: 164 feet across.

36:25.125 --> 36:26.792
I have no idea what made it.

36:26.917 --> 36:28.625
I'm completely open to the fact
that it could be aliens.

36:28.750 --> 36:32.125
What I do know, though,
is that people didn't make this.

36:32.208 --> 36:33.958
NARRATOR:
Gary King's experience

36:34.042 --> 36:36.792
is just one of many
firsthand accounts

36:36.917 --> 36:39.167
of designs
that mysteriously appear

36:39.292 --> 36:41.792
in a short period of time.

36:43.875 --> 36:46.042
And crop circle researchers cite

36:46.208 --> 36:48.000
that many of these
eyewitness accounts

36:48.083 --> 36:50.500
include sightings
of strange lights

36:50.583 --> 36:53.583
in and around the formation.

36:55.500 --> 36:59.792
In 1991, local photographer
Steve Alexander

36:59.875 --> 37:03.917
caught on camera an orb of light
floating above a crop formation

37:04.042 --> 37:05.958
in Wiltshire, England.

37:06.042 --> 37:08.708
-STEVE ALEXANDER: What is it?
-KAREN ALEXANDER: I don't know.

37:08.833 --> 37:11.000
CHARLES MALLETT:
His camera caught sight
of what seemed to be

37:11.083 --> 37:13.792
a white orb of light flying
right across this field

37:13.875 --> 37:17.292
right next to a crop circle.

37:17.375 --> 37:19.333
That orb of light,
whatever it was,

37:19.417 --> 37:22.292
flew directly over a tractor
working in the next field down,

37:22.417 --> 37:25.917
and later on, that farmer
was contacted and he said,

37:26.042 --> 37:28.125
"I saw this weird orb of light

37:28.208 --> 37:30.083
"about the size of a melon
or something

37:30.208 --> 37:31.750
fly over my tractor."

37:34.375 --> 37:36.917
I was so intrigued
by Gary King's story

37:37.042 --> 37:38.542
and the bizarre events

37:38.667 --> 37:40.625
surrounding the crop circle
phenomenon

37:40.708 --> 37:44.333
that I had to go
see it for myself.

37:49.625 --> 37:52.625
NARRATOR:
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos

37:52.750 --> 37:56.833
is meeting with crop circle
researcher Dr. Eltjo Haselhoff,

37:56.917 --> 38:00.750
to discuss a scientific paper
Dr. Haselhoff published

38:00.875 --> 38:05.042
in January of 2000, suggesting
that the crop circle formations

38:05.208 --> 38:09.875
might be created by an unknown
electromagnetic energy source.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.333
By measuring the length
of the growth nodes

38:13.458 --> 38:16.167
found along the plant stems
within a crop circle

38:16.292 --> 38:17.750
and comparing them
with the nodes

38:17.875 --> 38:20.458
on the undisturbed plants
in the field,

38:20.542 --> 38:22.583
Dr. Haselhoff
was able to predict

38:22.708 --> 38:26.333
what he thinks could be
creating this phenomenon.

38:26.500 --> 38:29.208
So, you've actually done
scientific analysis

38:29.333 --> 38:31.042
on some of those formations.

38:31.167 --> 38:34.458
So, what were some
of your conclusions?

38:34.542 --> 38:37.458
The hypothesis is that somehow,
electromagnetic energy

38:37.542 --> 38:39.500
is involved in the creation
of these crop circles,

38:39.625 --> 38:44.333
and that somehow this energy
causes node elongation.

38:44.458 --> 38:46.417
So the nodes in the stems
get longer.

38:46.542 --> 38:49.375
And the more energy,
the longer the nodes are.

38:49.500 --> 38:51.833
And that is very interesting,
because all you need to do

38:51.958 --> 38:54.833
is take a cross section
across a circle, like this,

38:54.917 --> 38:57.417
and measure the node length
in each of these positions.

38:59.167 --> 39:00.542
And actually,
this is what you see.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.042
This is in-- at the perimeter.

39:02.208 --> 39:05.375
See these nodes,
these dark areas?

39:05.500 --> 39:08.500
This is somewhere halfway,
and that's in the center.

39:08.583 --> 39:10.458
So, you see, there is a huge
difference in node length.

39:10.583 --> 39:12.000
TSOUKALOS: I mean, it's a huge--
I mean, this is fascinating.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.625
This is incredible.

39:13.708 --> 39:15.458
HASELHOFF:
It is not just a little bit.

39:15.542 --> 39:18.083
It's a difference in size
between a horse and an elephant.

39:18.208 --> 39:19.625
It's very, very significant.

39:19.708 --> 39:21.708
Yeah, I mean, what, uh,
what would do this?

39:21.833 --> 39:25.667
-That's, uh, quite weird.
-Well, in this case,
it was very interesting,

39:25.792 --> 39:28.333
because this crop circle, uh,
actually had an eyewitness

39:28.500 --> 39:30.292
when it was-- when it formed.

39:30.417 --> 39:33.917
And the eyewitness says,
"I saw a ball of light,"

39:34.042 --> 39:35.917
and it was standing still.

39:36.042 --> 39:38.250
And that is very important,
because when a ball of light

39:38.375 --> 39:40.500
is standing still,
we can very accurately predict

39:40.667 --> 39:44.083
how the energy will be
distributed on the ground,

39:44.208 --> 39:47.542
and we know there that will be
more energy in the center

39:47.708 --> 39:51.000
and the more energy,
the longer the nodes are.

39:51.083 --> 39:53.000
And in this case,
it was a perfect match.

39:53.167 --> 39:55.333
Wow.

39:55.458 --> 39:56.917
Amazing, isn't it?

39:57.042 --> 39:58.375
Now, this is where
I get the goose bumps,

39:58.542 --> 40:02.333
because clearly,
there is something there.

40:02.417 --> 40:07.375
And no one denies
that many of them are man-made,

40:07.500 --> 40:09.500
but then,
there is something bizarre.

40:09.583 --> 40:15.000
Do you have any idea how...

40:15.125 --> 40:19.167
or who might be behind it?

40:19.292 --> 40:21.583
That's a very
difficult question.

40:21.708 --> 40:24.042
What I can say about that is...

40:26.833 --> 40:28.458
...I don't know.

40:28.583 --> 40:33.208
So it is something that remains
a giant question mark.

40:33.375 --> 40:36.042
Absolutely, yes.

40:36.167 --> 40:39.292
NARRATOR:
Does Dr. Haselhoff's
scientific research

40:39.375 --> 40:42.542
provide evidence
that not all crop formations

40:42.667 --> 40:45.667
are the product of hoaxers?

40:45.792 --> 40:50.167
And if so, could there be
an otherworldly origin to them

40:50.333 --> 40:53.542
as ancient astronaut theorists
suggest?

40:55.708 --> 40:58.875
Each and every one
of the extraordinary encounters

40:59.000 --> 41:01.500
we've investigated
on <i>Ancient Aliens</i>

41:01.625 --> 41:04.875
truly defies
conventional explanation.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.125
And when you examine
them together,

41:07.208 --> 41:08.833
it becomes abundantly clear

41:09.000 --> 41:11.917
that we are not alone
in the universe.

41:12.042 --> 41:14.500
These events can
no longer be explained away

41:14.625 --> 41:18.417
as weather balloons or hoaxes.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.667
So, what are we left with?

41:21.792 --> 41:25.667
To me, there is only one answer:
extraterrestrial visitation.
