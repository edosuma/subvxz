as manic-depressive.

kill my sex drive.

-There was someone else.
-There was another man?

00:20.520 --> 00:23.398
Standing in the doorway.
He said, "There’s someone coming."

between you and Andy the last few days.

-It’s okay.
-I have a lump in my breast,

00:47.964 --> 00:50.133
and I’m going in for the biopsy right now.

me through it.

about a few months ago...

this is gonna change things.

-Yeah, this puts you behind a desk.
-I know.

that’s out.

The boss knows about it,
but he doesn’t know about it,

-Of course.

by eight o'clock.

-Crime scene’s still processing.
-Was she shot up with ketamine?

Since there’s no sign of forced entry
at the crime scenes,

06:56.666 --> 06:59.043

by posing as somebody official.

says it’s COD, when they go
for their check book,

07:10.847 --> 07:13.015
he grabs a purse or whatever he can
and runs.

from being a serial killer.

11:21.472 --> 11:23.140
Is that what happens when
you date a doctor?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.976
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, something like that.

11:29.397 --> 11:33.192
(CLEARS THROAT)
So, listen, uh, Connie’s pregnant.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.113
-Get out!
-Two and a half months.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.366
-You stud!
-Yeah, okay.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.910
(LAUGHS) You stud!

11:42.993 --> 11:44.495
All right, you go on,
take as long as you need

11:44.620 --> 11:46.455
-to get this out of your system.
-(LAUGHS) When...

11:46.831 --> 11:48.666
-When did you find out?
-Last night.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.793
And if you’d asked me yesterday,

11:51.001 --> 11:53.295
I’d have said the only way
Connie and me would have a baby

11:53.379 --> 11:56.424
would be with a manger, a virgin,
and three guys in turbans.

11:57.466 --> 11:59.760
-Is it a boy or a girl?
-Don’t know yet.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.888
-Is Connie gonna keep working?
-Yeah, as long as she can.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.808
Which is one reason why we wanna
keep this tight, okay?

12:05.933 --> 12:08.644
Yeah, no. No problem.
Have you told Theo?

12:09.437 --> 12:10.438
(CHUCKLES)

12:10.604 --> 12:13.065
-Yeah, he wants to name it, "Dumbledore."
-(CHUCKLES)

12:14.108 --> 12:15.234
Who else knows?

12:15.484 --> 12:16.610
Nobody, really.

12:16.902 --> 12:19.697
We thought we’d make an announcement
tonight before the ceremony.

12:20.322 --> 12:21.866
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.829
-Your doctor friend coming?
-No, she’s working.

12:28.456 --> 12:30.833
-Everything okay there?
-Yeah, fine.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.256
-ANDY: Is that our guy?
-That’s him.

12:40.301 --> 12:41.594
(CAR DOOR CLOSES)

12:43.220 --> 12:45.097
-Raymond Gerson.
-No, sorry.

12:45.347 --> 12:47.558
All right, hold on. One more time.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.269
-You guys detectives?
-Yeah, real detectives.

12:50.561 --> 12:53.355
-Okay, yeah, I’m Ray Gerson.
-You had to think about it?

12:53.647 --> 12:56.150
I got an ex-girlfriend who took
the breakup kind of hard,

12:56.275 --> 12:57.777
-and her brother’s been trying to...
-Shut up.

12:57.985 --> 13:01.572
Whoa. Whoa. Hey, I got civil rights...
Whoa, I got civil rights here you know.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.366
What’s this?
You passing yourself off as a cop?

13:04.492 --> 13:05.659
Are you kidding me? That’s illegal.

13:05.910 --> 13:07.328
-You got a gun on you?
-No.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.331
-JOHN: Gun!
-Toy gun! Toy gun!

13:10.623 --> 13:11.624
Yeah, it’s fake.

13:12.500 --> 13:13.918
Put your hands on the wall here.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.837
Oh! Oh!

13:17.922 --> 13:19.632
Please! Please, officer, don’t hurt me!

13:19.840 --> 13:21.967
-Get up, you big baby.
-(RAYMOND SCREAMING)

13:22.134 --> 13:24.011
Do you see this? Police brutality!

13:24.136 --> 13:26.305
I’ll show you police brutality
if you don’t get on your feet.

13:26.514 --> 13:28.057
(GROANS, PANTS)

13:28.224 --> 13:30.184
I have an explanation
for the badge and fake gun.

13:30.267 --> 13:31.268
Can’t wait to hear it.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.729
I’m not talking to this man! He’s violent!

13:33.979 --> 13:35.022
Move your ass.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.491
I can assure you we’ve filed...

13:45.574 --> 13:47.576
I’m publicly requesting
a civilian complaint form!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.119
-Shut up.
-I’m not talking to this man.

13:49.203 --> 13:51.413
He physically assaulted me,
and he’s verbally abusive.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.581
What’s going on here?

13:52.998 --> 13:55.167
I’m not trying to start any trouble,
but this guy is...

13:55.251 --> 13:57.461
Ray Gerson, found him with a fake gun
and a shield.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.465
Both easily explained and totally unworthy
of the physical abuse I sustained!

14:01.715 --> 14:03.926
-He fell when we grabbed him.
-This man attacked me!

14:04.009 --> 14:05.511
-Oh, quit playing it up.
-I can’t hear you,

14:05.719 --> 14:06.846
and I’m not talking to you!

14:07.054 --> 14:09.139
-Get him up to the pokey.
-Sure thing, lieutenant.

14:09.390 --> 14:12.768
This is all a smokescreen to avoid
answering about impersonating a cop.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.562
Yeah, fine, but it sounds like
there’s bad blood,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.814
so sit out the interview.
John, you and Diane take it.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.357
What are you talking about?

14:18.440 --> 14:21.277
I was just reassuring the inspector
how we’re going by the book on this case.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.445
Everybody here heard him refuse
to talk to you, so you’re out.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.865
Since when do the perps dictate
who they talk to?

14:25.948 --> 14:28.075
Let it go, Andy. That’s it.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.079
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

14:33.414 --> 14:35.082
-Come on.
-TONY: Let’s talk over here.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.213
Thanks.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.007
I’m telling you if that goon comes
in here...

14:43.215 --> 14:44.842
JOHN: The detective won’t be coming in.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.844
-He assaulted me!
-DIANE: No, he didn’t.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.721
But you don’t want him in here,
so, he’s not.

14:48.971 --> 14:50.347
Oh, I think my neck is stiffening up.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.559
Ray, you know what, quit tap-dancing
and get to the fake badge and gun.

14:55.185 --> 14:58.647
I have a very sick nephew.
I visit him whenever I can.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.357
He loves to play cops and robbers.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.319
I forgot to take off my toy gun
and badge when I left.

15:03.944 --> 15:06.822
You play cops and robbers
with your elderly neighbor, too?

15:07.072 --> 15:08.532
-Mrs. Kuzmenko?
-JOHN: That’s right.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.869
She saw your gun and badge and said
that you were calling yourself detective.

15:12.202 --> 15:16.040
That woman is so pickled in vodka,
she doesn’t know her way from the mailbox.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.752
Now, look, I may have shown her the toys,
but I never called myself that.

15:19.877 --> 15:22.713
-You can’t believe what she says.
-Well, Ray, we believe her.

15:22.880 --> 15:26.008
Add that to your previous collars
for criminal impersonation,

15:26.216 --> 15:28.969
and we’re gonna violate your parole
unless you start telling the truth.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.765
-Okay, the truth, here it is right now.
-Knock us out, Ray.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.768
I’m a pleaser, which comes
from having low self-esteem.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.227
Plus, I’m a frustrated actor.

15:37.519 --> 15:40.314
Now, you put that all together,
and you get a guy who likes to perform.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.984
Perform robberies, like you were doing
in your delivery man outfit?

15:44.109 --> 15:47.112
That was when I was abusing barbiturates
and before I got into therapy,

15:47.196 --> 15:49.281
which is when I cracked open all
this crazy behavior,

15:49.365 --> 15:50.407
and I aired out the poison.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.201
How long you been doing
the fake detective act?

15:52.660 --> 15:53.953
A couple of months.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.413
And only for friends and family.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.165
Quit looking at me all the time, Ray.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.000
I think you’re more full of bullshit
than he does.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.336
Okay.

16:03.379 --> 16:06.924
Couple of months, as a gag.
Now I do skits and improvisations.

16:07.049 --> 16:10.386
Now this may sound strange to you,
but it puts a smile on my nephew’s face,

16:10.469 --> 16:11.804
and that is worth the world to me.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.014
Do you know that little guy was diagnosed
with a very rare...

16:14.098 --> 16:15.140
That’s touching.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.142
Where were you between
eight and ten last night?

16:17.685 --> 16:20.521
(SIGHS) At home,
learning magic card stuff.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.981
Can anybody confirm this?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.149
-Why would they need to?
-DIANE: So that’s a no.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.819
What were you doing at 12th
and Avenue C three nights ago?

16:28.278 --> 16:30.114
-I wasn’t there.
-You got a parking ticket.

16:31.573 --> 16:32.658
Three nights ago?

16:32.950 --> 16:35.703
My car was in the shop,
my fuel pump gave out.

16:35.953 --> 16:38.372
-That explains the ticket how?
-Isn’t it obvious?

16:38.580 --> 16:40.290
After they told me my car wasn’t ready,

16:40.374 --> 16:43.002
those assholes at the garage
must have taken it for a joyride,

16:43.127 --> 16:47.631
which explains the extra 30 miles
on my odometer. Those bandits.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.174
Uh... what garage was this?

16:49.466 --> 16:51.927
Third and Avenue B.
The one with the Arabs.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.558
I don’t know, maybe it was 2nd and B.
I’m not good with addresses.

16:57.891 --> 16:58.892
You got a receipt?

16:59.018 --> 17:01.061
From those people? Are you kidding?
They barely speak English.

17:01.562 --> 17:02.938
Been to Brooklyn recently, Ray?

17:03.063 --> 17:06.025
Brooklyn? Uh, not in the last six months.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.735
No, I got no reason to go there.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.696
Come on, guys, what is this about?

17:11.113 --> 17:13.032
DIANE: Maybe you heard we’re looking
into some killings.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.325
Young women who’ve been raped
and strangled.

17:16.660 --> 17:19.997
That serial killer? (LAUGHS)
You’re looking at me for that?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.457
No, no, no...

17:21.540 --> 17:26.253
I... I don’t know anything about that.
I’m a harmless clown.

17:26.670 --> 17:27.838
JOHN: Mm-hmm.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.966
You’re not gonna mind sticking around
then while we check out your stories,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.177
-will you, Ray?
-I would prefer not to.

17:33.469 --> 17:36.388
We’ll get you a deck of cards.
Practice your tricks.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.780
-What’s your take on this guy?
-Greased pig.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.406
We’ll know more when we check his stories.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.825
-You run his metro card?
-Yeah, MTA's faxing over

17:56.909 --> 17:57.951
where he’s used it.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.369
We got to find out if this guy’s
got a nephew.

17:59.620 --> 18:02.498
I was just on with his parole officer.
I’ll call him back.

18:02.664 --> 18:05.626
I called Lucy Wenner. She’s on her way
in to see if she can ID Gerson.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.753
Did Lucy see a badge
when she was attacked?

18:07.836 --> 18:08.879
She didn’t mention that.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.257
Just got off the phone with the FBI,
they’re sending over guys

18:12.466 --> 18:14.093
from their behavioral sciences unit
in Quantico.

18:14.593 --> 18:17.096
-They’ll be here tomorrow morning.
-Profilers.

18:17.346 --> 18:19.223
Yeah, they’re gonna need copies
of your vouchers,

18:19.348 --> 18:21.433
your files, and lab reports.
So, have them by the end of the day.

18:21.850 --> 18:24.228
We’re gonna be errand boys
for these nitwits, so they can say

18:24.311 --> 18:26.730
we’re looking for a white male,
over 30, with anger issues.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.274
-Just make it happen.
-(JOHN SIGHS)

18:30.734 --> 18:34.113
You can’t let Gerson work you
with his mealy-mouthed "poor me" act.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.198
I’m hip to it. We’re just checking
his stories out.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.158
This guy’s a dog.
He only respects the leash.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.828
Real quick, garden roses or peonies?

18:41.036 --> 18:42.287
I can get both at cost.

18:43.455 --> 18:45.415
We’ll do both. But heavy on the roses.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.751
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

18:51.630 --> 18:54.842
-How’s she doing?
-Putting on a good face.

19:06.603 --> 19:09.314
-Hey. You getting nervous?
-I’m all right, actually.

19:09.439 --> 19:12.568
I mean, it’s not like 500 guests
at St. Patrick’s Cathedral. So...

19:12.693 --> 19:15.445
Yeah, when I got married,
it was City Hall.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.030
Still had butterflies, though.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.993
Oh, I’m sure I will, too.
I hope you’re gonna be there.

19:21.201 --> 19:22.452
I wouldn’t miss it for the world.

19:22.661 --> 19:23.996
We’re sorry for the short notice.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.498
It’s just the marriage license
was about to expire,

19:26.790 --> 19:28.959
and I don’t know, this case
seems like it may never clear.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.003
And you’re pregnant, right?

19:34.756 --> 19:37.092
Did Andy tell you? Was it that obvious?

19:37.384 --> 19:39.094
Just kind of picked up on some signs.

19:39.386 --> 19:41.346
’Cause I wasn’t gonna say anything.

19:41.513 --> 19:42.556
Why wouldn’t you?

19:44.474 --> 19:46.810
Connie, you don’t have to hold back
your good news

19:46.935 --> 19:49.104
because of what I’m going through. Hmm.

-Did you get the biopsy results yet?
-(SIGHS) No, maybe today.

I would have chosen.

The timing’s great.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.200
You and Andy have so much
to look forward to,

20:01.450 --> 20:04.703
and being around that keeps my mind
busy with something good.

I’m so happy for you,
so... don’t hold back around me.

-Okay?
-Okay.

-So Ray, what’s your nephew’s name?
-Uh... Billy.

20:42.991 --> 20:45.577
-Billy. How old’s Billy?
-Five.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.747
So, Billy, the sick little
five-year-old kid?

20:48.830 --> 20:50.457
That’s right. Ow!

20:50.624 --> 20:52.918
The next lie you make, it won’t be a slap.

20:53.126 --> 20:54.586
-It’ll be a fist.
-I’m not lying!

20:54.795 --> 20:56.838
We talked to your PO,
you got no brothers or sisters,

20:56.922 --> 20:58.298
that rules out nephews.

20:58.757 --> 21:02.344
I never said he was my biological nephew.
Look, look, he’s the son of a dear friend.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.763
I call him my nephew.
You ever hear of that before?

21:04.930 --> 21:06.723
We’ve heard of guys lying
through their teeth.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.183
JOHN: We ran your metro card.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.311
We know every subway and bus you’ve taken,
and contrary to you telling us

21:11.436 --> 21:13.188
you haven’t been in Brooklyn
in six months,

21:13.355 --> 21:16.608
we know you got on the subway
at Smith and Ninth in Brooklyn

three weeks ago,
18 hours after the first murder.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.406
Okay, okay, you’re right.
I was in Brooklyn.

The fog clears.

21:24.032 --> 21:26.868
(HESITATES) What happened was,
I was driving through Brooklyn

21:26.952 --> 21:29.121
when that bucket-of-bolts
car of mine broke down,

21:29.246 --> 21:30.706
which is why I got on the subway.

21:30.914 --> 21:35.002
My confusion is I wasn’t going
to Brooklyn, I was coming from there,

21:35.294 --> 21:37.754
which is a perfectly
understandable mistake,

21:37.879 --> 21:40.090
and it doesn’t implicate me
in any of these murders.

21:40.340 --> 21:42.718
Ray, I don’t think you appreciate
the trouble you’re in.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.011
-Ma’am, I...
-DIANE Shut up.

21:44.177 --> 21:47.639
All anybody wants is for these killings
to stop, and they don’t care how we do it.

21:48.056 --> 21:51.560
So, if we carry your body
out of this station house on a slab,

21:51.893 --> 21:53.437
they’ll throw us a parade,
do you get that?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.771
You got the wrong guy!

21:54.855 --> 21:56.773
We have an eyewitness
coming in for a line-up.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.609
You’ve got till then to come clean.
After that, there’s no deal.

21:59.901 --> 22:02.821
-I’ve been totally honest with you.
-You’ve lied about everything.

22:02.946 --> 22:05.198
There’s no little Billy you do skits for.

22:07.242 --> 22:11.038
Do you know how hard it is
to admit you’re a loser?

22:11.872 --> 22:13.040
I have no job.

22:13.206 --> 22:16.209
The only satisfaction I get
is pretending to be other people.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.088
Did you use your badge
to get inside these girls’ apartments?

22:20.339 --> 22:23.759
No. I mean, I’ve shown the badge
in the park to girls,

22:23.842 --> 22:25.302
so that maybe they would go out with me,

22:25.385 --> 22:27.012
but I never abused it,
and I certainly didn’t kill anyone.

22:27.637 --> 22:29.931
What were you doing in Brooklyn
a couple weeks ago?

22:30.474 --> 22:34.561
I... I was looking for a record store,
but my car broke down before I got there.

22:34.686 --> 22:38.398
-Ray, what were you doing there?
-I just told you.

22:40.150 --> 22:42.778
All right. Well, you’re waiting
in there until the line-up.

22:43.612 --> 22:44.696
Let’s go. Come on.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.702
Last chance, anything you want to say?

22:51.244 --> 22:52.788
I think I’ve told you quite a bit,

22:52.871 --> 22:54.456
but you won’t listen to me.
So, there we are!

23:09.262 --> 23:12.349
CONNIE: Lucy, when I lift the shade,
there’ll be six men in the next room.

23:12.557 --> 23:13.934
They can’t see or hear you.

23:14.142 --> 23:16.311
Tell us if any of them is the man
who attacked you.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.855
Take as much time as you need.
There’s no rush.

23:20.440 --> 23:21.775
Okay. (SIGHS)

23:28.490 --> 23:29.908
I don’t recognize any of them.

23:30.325 --> 23:31.368
You sure?

23:31.827 --> 23:32.911
He’s not there.

23:35.163 --> 23:36.248
He’s not there.

23:37.624 --> 23:38.667
Okay.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.254
I don’t understand. I thought you had him.

23:42.379 --> 23:43.713
This may take some time.

23:43.839 --> 23:46.049
So, this maniac is still out there?

23:49.469 --> 23:52.931
Well, that’s... that's great.
Can we please just get out of this room?

23:54.599 --> 23:57.686
Lucy... It’s gonna be all right, Lucy.

23:57.894 --> 23:58.979
Why me?

23:59.396 --> 24:01.940
Just because I went to Time Bar
for five minutes?

24:02.315 --> 24:04.234
I haven’t slept since the attack.

24:04.359 --> 24:07.237
I keep thinking I hear people
breaking into my apartment.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.905
If you’d like, we can get you
in touch with counselors

24:08.989 --> 24:11.741
-who work with crime victims.
-I don’t need counseling.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.994
I need you to find this guy!

24:14.202 --> 24:17.497
We’re doing everything we can to solve
the case, you have to believe that.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.958
Well, is it true what the papers
are saying,

24:20.083 --> 24:24.045
-that this is all related to the Time Bar?
-Possibly. We’re not sure.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.089
Let’s get you back to your apartment.

24:26.173 --> 24:28.675
No, I’m fine. Just spend your time
finding this guy.

24:29.384 --> 24:30.469
Call us when you get home.

24:30.927 --> 24:32.220
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

24:34.681 --> 24:35.682

24:38.602 --> 24:41.104
-(TELEPHONE RINGING)
-(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

24:45.650 --> 24:47.402
Any of the other impersonators
worth looking at?

24:47.736 --> 24:49.154
No, Gerson was the only hit.

24:49.613 --> 24:51.781
What if the guy we’re looking
for is not an impersonator?

24:51.990 --> 24:53.033
Meaning what?

24:53.533 --> 24:56.119
GREG: Maybe he’s not pretending
to be a cop, but he actually is a cop.

24:56.286 --> 24:57.329
Come on, Greg.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.873
It might explain why he’s so elusive.

25:00.165 --> 25:03.251
Yeah, we’ll just check that file
under cops who used to be sex offenders.

25:03.960 --> 25:05.462
I’m just floating an idea.

25:05.921 --> 25:07.255
So, Gerson’s a collar regardless?

25:07.464 --> 25:09.925
Yeah, we’re gonna violate his parole
for impersonating a cop.

25:10.008 --> 25:12.260
Anything comes up about Gerson
working under an alias?

25:12.469 --> 25:14.638
-No. Why?
-I ran a Triple I check on him

25:14.721 --> 25:15.764
for out-of-state collars,

25:15.931 --> 25:18.642
he was busted for burglary in New Jersey
under the name Raymond Shannon.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.353
-(SCOFFS) How long ago?
-RITA: Six years.

25:21.645 --> 25:24.731
The thing is, he was arrested
with another guy named Anthony Powell.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.316
Powell’s got a long sheet for sex crimes.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.735
Two rape arrests.
He lives in Battery Park.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.530
-When did Powell get out?
-RITA: Paroled seven months ago.

25:31.696 --> 25:33.657
-Boss, you got to let me back in there.
-No way.

25:33.907 --> 25:34.908
Don’t worry. I’ll handle it.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.619
-John, you can’t let this guy work you.
-JOHN: Woah!

25:37.869 --> 25:39.996
I’m not! Have you been watching
a different interview?

25:40.163 --> 25:42.165
Yeah, but now that we know
he’s a complete liar,

25:42.249 --> 25:44.668
-when you go back in there...
-Andy, I got it.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.882
We should call Lucy, get her back
in to look at Powell’s picture.

25:51.216 --> 25:52.384
I’ll take care of it.

25:55.845 --> 25:57.097
Don’t worry. He’ll be fine.

26:06.189 --> 26:08.858
-Josh, goodbye.
-Bye.

26:09.442 --> 26:12.070
May I leave now,
because obviously I didn’t get picked out

26:12.153 --> 26:13.196
for anything since I didn’t do anything?

26:13.530 --> 26:14.906
You ever take a collar in New Jersey?

26:15.115 --> 26:16.866
-Never.
-Under the name Ray Shannon?

26:16.950 --> 26:18.577
Okay, again, that was before therapy,

26:18.660 --> 26:20.704
which is the time in my life
I’ve completely blocked out.

26:20.954 --> 26:24.124
If the only thing that will make you
tell the truth is physical pain,

26:24.374 --> 26:25.375
I’ll provide it.

26:25.542 --> 26:28.003
And there’s no witnesses in here,
nobody to squawk to.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.797
-Understand me?
-Yeah.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.049
Anthony Powell. When did you see him last?

26:33.258 --> 26:34.509
RAYMOND:
Not since we got locked up together.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.220
We got a witness says it’s two guys
doing these rape-murders.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.347
I haven’t seen Tony in...
I don’t even know how long!

26:39.598 --> 26:41.349
You got no history of sex crimes,
Tony does,

26:41.558 --> 26:43.018
that tells us you were the lookout.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.936
RAYMOND: Not in a million years would
I do something like that.

26:45.186 --> 26:46.396
Then what was your car doing
near the crime scene

26:46.896 --> 26:48.815
three nights ago, when that girl
was murdered?

26:48.898 --> 26:50.400
I heard about it on my police scanner,

26:50.483 --> 26:52.402
so I went there to rubberneck,
to feel important.

26:52.527 --> 26:53.653
I didn’t go inside.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.531
I just talked to people on the streets,
that’s all I ever do!

26:57.157 --> 26:58.241
What do you know about Powell?

26:59.409 --> 27:01.202
I did a couple of minor jobs with him,
but that’s all.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.621
But he was too mean for my taste.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.956
I swear, I haven’t seen him
since we got popped for that burglary.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.499
You know about him doing rapes back then?

27:06.750 --> 27:08.084
That was the mean part about him.

27:08.209 --> 27:10.712
He kept talking about stepping it up,
maybe hurting a girl,

27:10.920 --> 27:13.298
maybe doing the kinds of things
that you’re talking about.

27:14.633 --> 27:15.675
(GASPS)

27:15.884 --> 27:17.844
If we catch you in one more lie,
you’re done.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.310
-Sir, I am just a harmless...
-Shut up!

27:34.903 --> 27:36.863
-Did you get ahold of Lucy?
-No answer.

27:36.988 --> 27:39.741
And, uh, she never called in
when she got home, like we asked her to.

27:40.158 --> 27:42.160
There could be a couple
of explanations for that.

27:42.243 --> 27:45.330
I sent a radio car to check on her.
Nobody answered when they knocked.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.374
They talked to a neighbor,
they said Lucy didn’t come home.

27:47.582 --> 27:50.752
All right, well tell Medavoy and Jones
to keep trying to find this Tony Powell.

27:50.835 --> 27:52.879
Then we’ll head to Lucy’s,
make sure she’s okay.

27:53.004 --> 27:54.964
Or do you want me to stay here
and push papers?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.091
Just go.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.433
Lucy?

28:08.269 --> 28:09.479
-Open it.
-You got a warrant?

28:09.562 --> 28:10.563
Just open it.

28:14.859 --> 28:17.112
All right, step back. Lucy?

28:19.572 --> 28:20.657
Lucy?

28:25.829 --> 28:26.830
Nothing.

28:28.331 --> 28:31.084
Bedroom’s locked. Lucy! You in there?

28:33.211 --> 28:35.380
-What do you think?
-I’ve got a bad feeling.

28:35.755 --> 28:37.132
Let’s take the door.

28:45.098 --> 28:46.850
(SIGHS) What the hell is this?

28:51.312 --> 28:54.858
This girl here, she’s my DOA
from Brooklyn, first one.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.652
-You sure?
-Pam Riegert.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.195
Her name’s written on the back.

29:06.202 --> 29:07.245
This girl’s from this morning.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.665
-The nurse?
-DIANE: Yeah, Linda Pascal.

29:11.040 --> 29:12.375
This is like a surveillance log.

29:13.001 --> 29:15.003
Dates and times when women
left the Time Bar,

29:15.128 --> 29:16.796
-where they walked to.
-Guys.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.469
-I'll call the squad.
-Yeah.

29:33.938 --> 29:36.232
We found some blue-and-white clothesline
in one of her drawers.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.193
And some pills in the kitchen,
probably ketamine,

29:38.401 --> 29:39.486
but we’ll have to wait
for the lab results.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.612
She has pictures?

29:40.737 --> 29:42.155
Looks like she hung out
in front of the Time Bar,

29:42.280 --> 29:43.448
took photos of the women
leaving the place,

29:43.740 --> 29:44.783
then followed them home.

29:44.908 --> 29:47.035
Why would she stage her own attack?
Attention?

29:47.160 --> 29:49.412
-Don't know.
-So, the rape aspect of the murders.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.747
Was she working with a male accomplice?

29:50.830 --> 29:51.915
We’ll know when we find her.

29:51.998 --> 29:54.793
TONY: There’s a state-wide alert
out for her. We’ll come up with it.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.170
So, she pointed it
to the Time Bar intentionally?

29:57.253 --> 30:00.423
Guys, looks like a hit list here.
All four victims plus, two others.

30:00.882 --> 30:02.258
Does it list the addresses
of the last two?

30:02.509 --> 30:03.510
JOHN: Yeah.

30:03.593 --> 30:05.261
All right, Greg, Baldwin, Rita,
you take one.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.554
You guys, take the other. Let's go.

I’ll get the super.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.742
-Yes?
-Donna Hallenbeck?

30:27.951 --> 30:28.993
That’s right.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.620
Please, can we come in and talk to you
a minute?

30:30.829 --> 30:32.705
-Um... I have company.
-Who?

30:33.122 --> 30:36.292
-A woman from the fireman’s charity.
-Is there a problem?

30:36.376 --> 30:38.086
-ANDY: We need to talk to her.
-DONNA: Excuse me?

-DONNA: What is going on?

30:41.464 --> 30:43.883
-Stay back, Miss Hallenbeck.
-We’re having tea.

Keep your hands where we can see ’em.

30:45.760 --> 30:46.845
-What’s in here?
-Nothing.

30:47.095 --> 30:48.346
Hey, hey, hey, sit back.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.640
What is going on here?

30:58.648 --> 30:59.649
Oh, my God.

31:01.568 --> 31:03.278
-Get on your feet.
-Get up.

31:03.570 --> 31:04.571
-DIANE: Come on.
-Up.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.969
DIANE: Pam Riegert,
three weeks ago in Brooklyn.

31:29.345 --> 31:30.471
Why’d you pick her?

31:33.016 --> 31:34.183
JOHN: Angela Pratt?

31:35.226 --> 31:36.269
Gretchen Dorm.

31:37.228 --> 31:40.064
We know you killed these women.
Help us understand why.

31:41.316 --> 31:42.859
DIANE: They all went to the Time Bar.

31:42.984 --> 31:45.236
You photographed them leaving,
you followed them home.

31:45.904 --> 31:47.655
Lucy, we know all this.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.490
There’s no use keeping quiet.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.868
All that’s gonna do
is make you unsympathetic

31:52.201 --> 31:54.370
to us, to the judge, everybody.

31:54.621 --> 31:57.999
You don’t know what it’s like
to be called a no-tit pig, do you?

32:00.460 --> 32:02.712
-Who called you that?
-James Carlin.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.548
-Jimmy.
-When?

32:06.799 --> 32:09.636
I applied to be a waitress at the Time Bar
six months ago.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.973
I was talking to the manager
when Jimmy came up and said,

32:14.057 --> 32:16.267
like I wasn’t even there,

32:17.393 --> 32:21.272
"Alex, you better not hire
this no-tit pig."

32:22.482 --> 32:26.444
So, all this was about getting back
at Carlin for insulting you?

32:26.819 --> 32:28.571
I have been angry before.

32:29.280 --> 32:30.323
(CHUCKLES)

32:31.240 --> 32:35.578
But when that happened,
I found myself getting so angry.

32:36.621 --> 32:37.872
It didn’t stop.

32:39.582 --> 32:42.210
-Why’d you fake your own attack?
-Because!

32:43.628 --> 32:47.966
The papers weren’t mentioning
James Carlin by name.

32:49.092 --> 32:51.928
There was even an editorial
cautioning the public

32:52.011 --> 32:54.472
against associating the Time Bar
with the murders.

32:55.014 --> 32:57.016
So, you made up that you heard
one of your attackers say,

32:57.141 --> 32:58.476
"Jimmy’s gonna be pissed,"

32:58.768 --> 33:00.853
so that we’d look at Carlin
for being behind this.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.814
That is correct.

33:04.607 --> 33:07.986
-How’d you pick your victims?
-They frequented the Time Bar.

33:09.112 --> 33:13.032
They helped make Jimmy a wealthy man.
They basically gave him the mandate

33:13.116 --> 33:17.286
to act like an insensitive anus.

33:19.414 --> 33:22.834
And these women...
you got inside their apartment each time

33:23.042 --> 33:24.877
by saying you were from a charity?

33:29.716 --> 33:30.758
(SNIFFLES)

33:31.676 --> 33:34.846
I would like it known that the women
didn’t experience the rapes.

33:35.638 --> 33:38.683
I knocked them on the head, sedated them,

33:38.975 --> 33:41.811
then inserted the dildo
with the condom on it,

33:41.894 --> 33:43.229
then strangled them.

33:45.523 --> 33:46.607
No pain.

33:48.234 --> 33:51.571
This was the only way you thought
to get back at James Carlin?

33:51.821 --> 33:55.908
It was the best way. I wanted to ruin him.

33:57.118 --> 33:59.620
Your point was made.
Why’d you keep killing women?

34:09.464 --> 34:12.175
Lucy, I once interviewed a guy
who killed six women.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.178
He said it was because his mother
was a drug addict,

34:15.303 --> 34:18.723
so he killed drug addicts.
But after his first victim,

34:18.890 --> 34:21.851
it stopped being about the fact
that they were addicts,

34:22.310 --> 34:27.940
and it became more about the rush he got,
the sense of power and control.

34:28.024 --> 34:31.486
He said that was the first time
in his life that he felt that way.

34:33.321 --> 34:37.033
Lucy, is that why you killed
Linda Pascal this morning,

34:37.158 --> 34:40.119
and you were planning
on killing Donna Hallenbeck?

34:42.163 --> 34:46.292
You think you are so smart, don’t you?

34:56.886 --> 34:58.096
So, do you think she’ll stand trial?

34:58.387 --> 35:00.431
Honestly, she won’t make
the competency hearing.

35:00.681 --> 35:02.475
So, five years in a mental hospital?

35:02.558 --> 35:04.227
She’ll be there the rest of her life.

35:05.019 --> 35:07.939
That was the mayor’s office.
He sends his congratulations.

35:08.064 --> 35:09.690
Good work, everybody.

35:10.191 --> 35:12.068
Team, did it as a team.

35:12.443 --> 35:13.861
It was good working with you, Diane.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.822
-I appreciate your help.
-Thanks, Lieu.

35:16.364 --> 35:18.574

I’ll buy the first round.

-Yeah.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.708
-Which I don’t know anything about, so...
-It’s just gonna be us.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.377
It’s not like anybody’s gonna rat on you.

35:29.544 --> 35:32.463
No. I appreciate that,
but I need to maintain a certain level

35:32.547 --> 35:33.965
of deniability with the department.

35:34.132 --> 35:36.592
-ANDY: Okay.
-You and Connie have my best wishes.

35:41.055 --> 35:42.890
-Eight o'clock, guys.
-See you there.

35:45.017 --> 35:47.562
I’m gonna stop by the Time Bar,
break the news to Carlin.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.230
Yeah, he deserves that much.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.525
-Want somebody to take a ride with you?
-I’m good. Thanks.

35:53.609 --> 35:56.028
-I’m gonna help John set up.
-I’m right behind you.

35:58.865 --> 35:59.907
Listen, uh...

36:00.825 --> 36:03.035
I know you’re a non-drinker, Andy.
I respect that.

36:03.327 --> 36:05.288
Don’t worry, Medavoy.
There’s gonna be booze.

36:05.454 --> 36:07.790
Well, not only is the marriage
to be celebrated,

36:07.874 --> 36:09.542
but the end of a long case.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.879
-Plus, I’ll be taking a cab.
-Medavoy, quick. What?

36:13.379 --> 36:15.882
-I may get hammered.
-Fine, go nuts.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.597
-See you there.
-Yeah, partner.

36:27.768 --> 36:29.187
Did a great job breaking him in.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.647
-He’s the real deal.
-Yeah, he’ll be all right.

36:32.106 --> 36:33.191
See you at eight.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.249
-Who’s dead now?
-No one.

36:50.708 --> 36:52.627
We got the person who’s behind
the murders.

36:53.753 --> 36:55.588
-Who?
-Her name’s Lucy Wenner.

36:55.963 --> 36:58.049
-A girl rapist?
-She made them look like rapes,

36:58.132 --> 36:59.717
so, we’d think the killer was a man.

36:59.800 --> 37:01.886
She also planted the matchbooks
to point to your bar.

37:02.887 --> 37:04.013
She’s got a beef against me?

37:04.263 --> 37:06.057
You turned her down for a waitress job.

37:06.933 --> 37:08.267
So, you’re telling me my life got ruined

37:08.351 --> 37:10.519
because I wouldn’t hire
some bitch to carry drinks?

37:10.686 --> 37:12.104
She’s pretty imbalanced.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.148
Okay. So... what?

37:15.233 --> 37:16.484
You here for a pat on the back?

37:16.567 --> 37:18.277
I’m just letting you know
the case is closed.

37:18.361 --> 37:22.782
Yeah. You mean like my bar, this hotel,
’cause the bank called my loan,

37:23.199 --> 37:24.408
one of the things I was dealing with

37:24.492 --> 37:26.285
while you were accusing me
of being involved in this.

37:26.577 --> 37:29.330
-We had to throw a wide net.
-That some kind of an apology?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.457
I came here as a courtesy, Mr. Carlin.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.086

-And until then, where does the ring stay?

-In my pocket.
-Good.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.249
Oh! There’s one other thing.
Very important.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.458
Okay.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.670
-You’re in charge of the bachelor party.
-What’s that?

You have to rent a motor home
and drive me and my buddies

38:27.763 --> 38:29.390
All right, save me a spot in front, huh?

38:29.682 --> 38:31.726
It’s about the vows,
there are a lot of options.

38:32.184 --> 38:34.729
Nothing about her obeying me,
’cause I’ll never hear the end of that.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.564
Of course not.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.816
Other than that, let’s keep it
nice and simple,

38:38.899 --> 38:40.026

-"Love, honor, and comfort..."
-John, you’re making me nervous.

-I... It’s just...
-The first one, it’s fine.

And anything about Connie expecting?

38:52.371 --> 38:54.540
We already told everybody, okay?

Okay. Well...

Perhaps I should just say a few words
about Andy and Connie.

40:31.512 --> 40:34.515
When I first met Detective Sipowicz,
many years ago,

40:35.766 --> 40:38.936
I thought if ever two people
wouldn’t get along, it would be us.

40:40.146 --> 40:43.023
But we did, and we have.

40:44.984 --> 40:48.237
And I don’t know if I’ve ever told you
how much your friendship means to me.

40:52.491 --> 40:57.538
And when I met Detective McDowell,
I don’t mean to brag, but...

40:58.289 --> 41:00.916
I knew she and Detective Sipowicz
would be a perfect match.

41:01.459 --> 41:03.294
-GREG: Come on. (LAUGHS)
-(LAUGHS)

41:03.752 --> 41:06.672
It’s true. It’s in my diary
if you want to check.

41:08.716 --> 41:12.470
I could tell they had
the similarities to attract each other,

41:12.553 --> 41:15.264
but... also the different strengths
to complement.

41:16.932 --> 41:19.894
In a way, Andy and Connie
are like all of us here.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.812
We come from very different backgrounds,

41:21.937 --> 41:24.732
and who knows if,
under different circumstances,

41:24.857 --> 41:26.025
we would be in each other’s lives.

41:27.776 --> 41:29.028
But this job we have...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.449
brought us together as a family.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.994
For some of us, it’s our only family.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.456
And it’s something that cannot be broken.
