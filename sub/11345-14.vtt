male announcer:
IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:08.709 --> 00:12.180
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES ARE
CONSIDERED ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:12.213 --> 00:14.748
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:14.782 --> 00:16.617
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:16.650 --> 00:17.818
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.851 --> 00:20.121
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.722
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.762
- WHY AM I STILL HERE
AND YOU'RE HEADING HOME?

00:28.796 --> 00:31.165
- CAN'T WORK
ALL NIGHT LIKE YOU, SUNNY.

00:31.199 --> 00:33.834
- MOST GUYS CAN'T, RIGGS.
- SMARTASS.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.170
- WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE,
WALDEN?

00:36.204 --> 00:38.139
GOING HOME
TO KISS THE BABY?

00:38.172 --> 00:39.673
- YEAH,
AND THEN PASS OUT.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.710
- LIGHTWEIGHT.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.456
WHO GETS THE
RIVERA WITNESS STATEMENTS?

00:55.489 --> 00:58.292
- OVER HERE.

00:58.326 --> 01:01.395
- COFFEE RUN.
MY TREAT.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.298
TRIPLE ESPRESSO.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.834
AND GRAB
ONE FOR PAGE.

01:06.867 --> 01:10.070
- PAGE LEFT.
- REALLY?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.545
- HER PHONE AND GLASSES
ARE STILL HERE.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.581
- I WATCHED HER WALK OUT
THE DOOR HOURS AGO.

01:23.451 --> 01:27.155
- THIS IS SALIYAH QADRI,
12TH FLOOR.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.690
IS PAGE FERGUSON'S CAR
STILL IN HER SPACE?

01:29.723 --> 01:31.892
I'LL WAIT.
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

01:31.925 --> 01:33.527
SHE PROBABLY JUST WENT HOME.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.897
- YEP, I'M HERE.
OKAY, THANKS.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.899
HER CAR'S GONE.

01:38.932 --> 01:42.136
- LIKE I SAID, SHE WENT HOME.

01:44.672 --> 01:47.675
- WITHOUT HER BAG?

01:49.210 --> 01:51.479
DID PAGE GET ANY CALLS
BEFORE SHE LEFT?

01:51.512 --> 01:54.215
- UH...I DON'T KNOW.
- FIND OUT!

01:54.248 --> 01:58.219
- THIS IS THE SERVICE VEHICLE
OPERATING SUPERVISOR.

01:58.252 --> 01:59.287
THERE'S STILL NO RESPONSE

01:59.320 --> 02:01.289
FROM THE VEHICLE'S
EMBEDDED CELL.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.424
WHAT ELSE DO YOU NEED?
- IS PAGE FERGUSON'S CAR

02:03.457 --> 02:05.393
STILL PARKED
IN UPPER MANHATTAN?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.728
- GPS SHOWS IT'S BEEN IDLING
IN THE SAME LOCATION

02:07.761 --> 02:09.297
FOR 30 MINUTES.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.664
IS THE CUSTOMER IN DISTRESS?

02:10.698 --> 02:12.200
- I DON'T KNOW YET.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.601
- THEN I'M VIOLATING
HER PRIVACY

02:13.634 --> 02:15.236
AND NEED VERIFICATION
BEFORE WE--

02:15.269 --> 02:17.171
- I SEE HER CAR.
JUST STAND BY.

02:44.532 --> 02:47.535
- [stifled yell]

02:50.003 --> 02:53.407
- PAGE!
IT'S SUNNY!

02:53.441 --> 02:55.509
- [screams]

02:58.979 --> 03:02.250
- NO!

03:09.022 --> 03:10.791
- MS. FERGUSON,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

03:10.824 --> 03:12.526
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

03:12.560 --> 03:14.495
YOUR VEHICLE
SHOWS SIGNS OF IMPACT.

03:14.528 --> 03:17.765
FIRE AND RESCUE HAVE BEEN
DISPATCHED TO YOUR LOCATION.

03:17.798 --> 03:20.401
MS. FERGUSON?

03:20.434 --> 03:23.404
[dramatic music]

03:23.437 --> 03:29.443
*

04:08.916 --> 04:10.518
- IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THIS.
- LATE NIGHT?

04:10.551 --> 04:13.287
- EMPTY APARTMENT,
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

04:13.321 --> 04:14.855
- BETTER THAN BEING
LAID UP WITH THE FLU,

04:14.888 --> 04:17.358
LIKE YOUR PARTNER.
- HE'LL LIVE.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.792
WHAT DO WE GOT?

04:18.826 --> 04:20.861
- SHREDDED PANTIES,
SIGNS OF PENETRATION,

04:20.894 --> 04:22.963
BUT NO FLUIDS.
- HE RAPES HER,

04:22.996 --> 04:25.299
THEY STRUGGLE...

04:25.333 --> 04:26.634
SHE WAS EITHER PUSHED
OR SHE FELL.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.669
- AFTER HE CUT HER UP.

04:28.702 --> 04:31.305
SLASHES ACROSS
HER THROAT, ARMS, AND GROIN.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.574
NONE OF THEM FATAL.
- PSYCHO-SEXUAL TORTURE?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.843
- KNIFE'S USUALLY BIGGER.
THE KILLER USED A BLADE

04:35.876 --> 04:37.678
MEASURING NO MORE
THAN THREE TO FOUR INCHES.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.547
- WELL, IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
SHE WAS STRANGLED.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.316
BUT SOMETHING WAS CUT OFF.
- I.D., MAYBE?

04:42.350 --> 04:44.352
- IS THIS THE VICTIM'S CAR?
- DON'T KNOW.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.887
TAGS AND REGISTRATION
ARE MISSING TOO.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.889
- WELL, SOMEONE SANITIZED
THE CRIME SCENE.

04:48.922 --> 04:50.891
- MAYBE THE WITNESS SAW WHO.
- WITNESS?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.394
- SAID HER NAME'S
SUNNY QADRI.

04:53.427 --> 04:54.462
- WHERE'S SHE NOW?

04:54.495 --> 04:57.698
- SHOWING CSU WHERE
THE VICTIM TOOK A NOSE DIVE.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.401
- THEY MAY HAVE STRUGGLED
AGAINST THE GLASS HERE.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.902
BUT I THINK
SHE WAS PUSHED FROM THERE.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.805
- ARE YOU THE WITNESS, OR
ARE YOU ON THE JOB, MS. QADRI?

05:04.838 --> 05:06.507
- BOTH, I'M
A DETECTIVE INVESTIGATOR

05:06.540 --> 05:08.976
FOR THE BROOKLYN D.A.
- OKAY, WELL, THIS IS MANHATTAN,

05:09.009 --> 05:10.177
AND YOU'RE TAMPERING WITH
MY CRIME SCENE.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.613
- I DIDN'T REMOVE ANYTHING
THAT WOULD LEAD TO HER KILLER.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.082
- DID YOU SEE HIM?
- NO, I HEARD A NOISE.

05:15.115 --> 05:18.752
THEN SHE SCREAMED,
AND CAME FLYING OVER THE EDGE.

05:21.121 --> 05:22.856
- WHAT WERE YOU DOING HERE?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.393
- I WAS LOOKING FOR HER.
WE WORK TOGETHER.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.728
I DIDN'T WANT HER
NAME GOING OUT OVER THE AIR.

05:27.761 --> 05:30.531
- YOU STRIPPED HER I.D.,
HER TAGS, AND HER REGISTRATION

05:30.564 --> 05:33.467
TO AVOID THE PRESS?
- AND ONE P.P.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.670
- I THINK
YOU BETTER TELL ME WHY.

05:36.704 --> 05:38.806
- PAGE FERGUSON'S
THE UNIT CHIEF

05:38.839 --> 05:40.574
FOR A MAJOR
NARCOTICS BUREAU.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.109
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT SHE WAS IN TROUBLE?

05:42.142 --> 05:44.578
- STUFF ON HER DESK,
PURSE IN HER DRAWER,

05:44.612 --> 05:46.814
GUN STILL INSIDE.
- GUN?

05:46.847 --> 05:48.682
WHO WAS SHE AFRAID OF?

05:48.716 --> 05:50.784
- ANGEL RIVERA.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.986
HE IS A MEMBER
OF THE LATIN KINGS,

05:53.020 --> 05:54.922
AND THREATENED PAGE
IN OPEN COURT.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.157
WE PUT PROTOCOLS IN PLACE,

05:57.190 --> 06:00.528
SHE WOULDN'T GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT TELLING SOMEONE.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.496
- ANYONE ELSE SHE
DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH?

06:02.530 --> 06:04.632
- PAGE DEALT WITH
CONVICTS AND HUMPS.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.167
YOU WANT A SUSPECT?
LOOK IN HER FILES.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.136
- WHAT ABOUT A BOYFRIEND?
SOMEONE IN HER PRIVATE LIFE.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.506
- SHE DIDN'T HAVE ONE.
SHE WORKED 90-HOUR WEEKS.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.742
- WELL, THE VIOLENCE
TO HER BODY

06:14.775 --> 06:16.944
SUGGESTS THAT
THIS ATTACK WAS PERSONAL.

06:20.080 --> 06:24.452
- HER PARENTS ARE DEAD.
NO HUSBAND.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.454
THAT'S WHY IT WAS SO TOUGH

06:26.487 --> 06:29.122
WHEN SHE GOT
BREAST CANCER LAST YEAR.

06:29.156 --> 06:33.961
TO HAVE A MASTECTOMY
AND CHEMO ALMOST KILLED HER.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.998
BUT SHE RALLIED,
REMISSION GAVE HER A PURPOSE--

06:38.031 --> 06:41.168
TO LIVE EVERY MOMENT,
TO SMELL A FLOWER...

06:41.201 --> 06:45.939
TO START AN OFFICE FLING.

06:45.973 --> 06:47.508
- THAT ENDED BADLY?

06:47.541 --> 06:49.810
- WITH VISIBLE
CUTS AND BRUISES.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.812
SHE WAS ASHAMED OF IT.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.915
- DID YOU KNOW THE GUY?

06:54.948 --> 06:56.850
- SHE WOULDN'T TELL ME.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.653
SO I GAVE HER A GUN
AND SHOWED HER HOW TO USE IT.

06:59.687 --> 07:01.822
- HOW MANY MEN
WORK IN YOUR OFFICE?

07:01.855 --> 07:04.157
- AROUND 50.
BUT WHOEVER HE IS,

07:04.191 --> 07:06.226
PAGE WOULDN'T HAVE
GONE ALONE TO MEET HIM.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.728
MY MONEY'S ON RIVERA.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.463
- AND WHERE IS RIVERA NOW?

07:09.497 --> 07:12.232
- RIKERS.
WITH PLENTY OF LATIN KINGS.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.234
ANY ONE OF THEM
COULD'VE PASSED THE MESSAGE

07:14.267 --> 07:15.703
TO A GUNMAN OUTSIDE.

07:15.736 --> 07:19.206
- EXCEPT FOR THE FACT THAT
RIVERA'S A THUG.

07:19.239 --> 07:22.009
IF HE WANTED HER DEAD
HE WOULD'VE USED A BULLET.

07:22.042 --> 07:24.244
- YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

07:24.277 --> 07:27.848
A YEAR AGO,
RIVERA NAIL-GUNNED

07:27.881 --> 07:30.851
THIS FAMILY'S
APARTMENT SHUT.

07:30.884 --> 07:32.820
THEN POURED GASOLINE

07:32.853 --> 07:36.590
UNDER THE DOOR AND
LIT A MATCH.

07:36.624 --> 07:37.991
- THE BASTARD ACTUALLY

07:38.025 --> 07:39.893
SHOWED HIS FACE
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

07:39.927 --> 07:43.063
- THE FAMILY DID EVERYTHING
WE ASK THE PUBLIC TO DO.

07:43.096 --> 07:46.600
THEY CALLED POLICE,
KEPT AN EYE ON THE DRUG TRAFFIC,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.602
AND STEPPED FORWARD
AS WITNESSES.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.203
- SO WHY WEREN'T
THEY IN PROTECTIVE CUSTODY?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.573
- BUDGET.
IT WASN'T A RICO CASE.

07:52.606 --> 07:53.941
- WHEN DID YOU FINALLY
PINCH HIM?

07:53.974 --> 07:55.576
- WE FLIPPED
ONE OF HIS CORNER BOYS.

07:55.609 --> 07:56.577
DAMON MERCED,

07:56.610 --> 07:59.547
WHO IS GOING TO TESTIFY
AGAINST ANGEL RIVERA.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.682
TRIAL STARTS IN TWO DAYS.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.552
RIVERA MUST HAVE FOUND OUT
THAT DAMON IS OUR WITNESS.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.987
SO HE TOLD THE HITTER
TO LURE PAGE OUT

08:07.020 --> 08:10.691
WITH PAGE DEAD, THEY'LL ASK FOR
A CONTINUANCE AND GET IT.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.660
- I'VE PULLED THE LUDS
ON THE VICTIM'S CELL PHONE.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.563
SHE GOT A FORWARDED CALL
FROM A BURN PHONE

08:15.596 --> 08:17.097
TEN MINUTES BEFORE
SHE LEFT THE BUILDING.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.666
- WHERE WAS PAGE
WHEN SHE GOT THE CALL?

08:18.699 --> 08:21.635
- WITH HER BOSS,
DEPUTY D.A. IAN WOFFORD, WHY?

08:21.669 --> 08:26.073
- AN S.O.S. EXPLAINS
WHY PAGE LEFT HER STUFF

08:26.106 --> 08:27.274
AND WENT STRAIGHT
TO THE CAR.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.544
WOFFORD'S OFFICE
IS NEXT TO THE GARAGE.

08:30.578 --> 08:32.613
- SO THE CALLER MUST'VE
BEEN SOMEBODY THAT SHE KNEW

08:32.646 --> 08:34.682
AND DIDN'T
CONSIDER A THREAT.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.884
SO WHERE DID SHE GO
AFTER SHE GOT THE CALL?

08:36.917 --> 08:39.086
- WELL, THE NAVI ROUTING
SHOWS AFTER THEY LEFT BROOKLYN

08:39.119 --> 08:41.655
THEY WENT INTO MANHATTAN,
THEN INTO NEW JERSEY,

08:41.689 --> 08:43.657
THEN THEY ENDED UP AT
KING OF PRUSSIA,

08:43.691 --> 08:46.026
AND WENT RIGHT BACK.
- WHAT THE HELL WAS SHE UP TO?

08:46.059 --> 08:47.861
- MAYBE SOMEBODY ELSE GOT
IN THE CAR WITH HER.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.030
- THERE'S NOTHING ELSE TO SAY.
LIV?

08:50.063 --> 08:52.666
NO. NO, I AM NOT
TALKING OFF THE RECORD.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.134
CALL THE PRESS ROOM
AT ONE P.P.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.169
- PRESS FOUND OUT
THAT PAGE WAS A D.A.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.738
- YEP.

08:57.771 --> 09:00.007
AND I AM TEMPTED TO HAND THEM
RIVERA ON A PLATTER.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.575
[phone ringing]
- HE DIDN'T DO IT.

09:01.609 --> 09:02.643
- THE GUY IS
A CREATIVE KILLER.

09:02.676 --> 09:05.979
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE DIDN'T ORCHESTRATE A HIT?

09:06.013 --> 09:08.015
- THE LATIN KINGS WOULD'VE
DONE HER AND DUMPED HER,

09:08.048 --> 09:10.217
NOT HELD HER FOR HOURS
AND THEN CUT HER UP.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.653
- IT'S PERSONAL.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.255
- PAGE WAS IN AN ABUSIVE
RELATIONSHIP WITH A COWORKER.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.625
SHE SHOWED ALL THE SIGNS
OF A BATTERED WOMAN.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.660
- OKAY, YEAH.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.762
BUT TALK TO RIVERA,
COVER YOUR ASS.

09:21.795 --> 09:22.930
- AND YOURS TOO.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.233
[phone ringing]

09:28.636 --> 09:31.605
[buzzing]

09:31.639 --> 09:33.641
- MY CLIENT HAD NOTHING TO
DO WITH PAGE FERGUSON'S DEATH.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.709
HE'S BEEN SITTING
AT RIKERS WITH OUT BAIL

09:35.743 --> 09:36.777
FOR OVER SIX MONTHS.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.746
- WITH PLENTY OF
ACCESS TO A PHONE.

09:38.779 --> 09:40.681
- CHECK THE LOGS, BITCH.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.616
- MAKING THREATS
AGAINST PAGE IN OPEN COURT

09:42.650 --> 09:43.951
WASN'T SMART.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.620
- UNLESS I WALK THROUGH
WALLS, IT WASN'T ME.

09:46.654 --> 09:49.389
- SOMEONE ELSE
DID IT FOR YOU, ANGEL.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.858
- FOR WHAT REASON?

09:50.891 --> 09:52.325
- MR. RIVERA'S
STILL FACING TRIAL.

09:52.359 --> 09:53.627
AND ANOTHER PROSECUTOR
WILL JUST TAKE HER PLACE.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.695
[cell phone rings]

09:54.728 --> 09:56.363
- WELL, I GET THE FEELING
THAT ANGEL LIKES TO KILL

09:56.396 --> 09:57.798
JUST FOR FUN.

09:57.831 --> 10:00.801
- I FIND OUT
YOU ORDERED THE HIT,

10:00.834 --> 10:03.203
I WILL END YOU.

10:03.236 --> 10:06.273
- ANYBODY CAN GET GOT.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.374
EVEN YOU.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.677
- BRING IT.
SEND A HITTER MY WAY,

10:09.710 --> 10:11.178
HE'S GOING STRAIGHT
TO THE MORGUE.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.347
- OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH.
THIS FISHING TRIP IS OVER.

10:14.381 --> 10:17.384
- WARNER'S GOT SOMETHING.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.188
- THE FALL'S IMPACT
SEVERED HER SPINE

10:21.221 --> 10:23.390
IN THE CERVICAL
AND THORACIC REGIONS.

10:23.423 --> 10:26.426
- DEATH WAS IMMEDIATE.
I WATCHED HER DIE.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.996
- BUT SOMETHING'S
BUGGING YOU.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.764
- HER HANDS.

10:30.798 --> 10:33.834
SHE'S GOT OVER 30 STAB WOUNDS
AND SHALLOW CUTS ON HER BODY.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.669
AND YET, THERE
ARE NO DEFENSIVE SLASHES.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.671
- WAS SHE
RESTRAINED OR DRUGGED?

10:37.705 --> 10:40.407
- THE ONLY DRUGS IN HER SYSTEM
WERE ANTI-DEPRESSANTS.

10:40.440 --> 10:45.679
I ALSO FOUND HEALED SCARS--
SOME SHALLOW, SOME QUITE DEEP

10:45.713 --> 10:48.749
BASED ON THE ANGLE,
THEY WERE SELF-INFLICTED.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.753
- YOU THINK SHE'S A CUTTER?
- YES.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.987
- WELL, PAGE
DIDN'T RAPE HERSELF.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.222
- SHE MIGHT HAVE.

10:55.255 --> 10:58.025
ONE-INCH HEALING CUTS
IN THE VAGINAL CANAL

10:58.058 --> 11:00.093
CONSISTENT
WITH A SMOOTH-SURFACED,

11:00.127 --> 11:01.461
HARD-EDGED INSTRUMENT.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.864
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT SHE
SODOMIZED HERSELF WITH A KNIFE?

11:03.897 --> 11:05.833
- PEOPLE CUT THEMSELVES
TO COPE WITH TRAUMA.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.802
SHE MIGHT'VE SUFFERED
FROM ALGOLAGNIA,

11:08.836 --> 11:11.772
WHERE THE BRAIN INTERPRETS
PAIN SIGNALS AS PLEASURE.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.206
- THAT'S HORRIBLE.

11:13.240 --> 11:16.744
- IT'S WHY THEY SUFFER IN
SILENCE AND HIDE THEIR WOUNDS.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.812
DID THE VICTIM OWN A BLADE?

11:18.846 --> 11:20.814
- A PEN KNIFE.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.882
IT BELONGED TO HER FATHER.

11:21.915 --> 11:24.985
- BUT THERE WAS NO KNIFE
IN THE CAR OR ON HER BODY.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.155
DID YOU TAKE IT
FROM THE CRIME SCENE?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.824
- NO!

11:30.858 --> 11:32.860
PAGE DIDN'T DIE FROM CUTS.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.995
SHE WAS SHOVED OFF
THE BUILDING.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.965
- SUNNY, YOU DIDN'T SEE
ANYBODY FLEEING THE SCENE.

11:41.134 --> 11:44.137
- YOU'RE RULING IT
A SUICIDE?

11:44.171 --> 11:46.206
- THERE'S NO WAY TO TELL.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.343
- SHE WAS WITH HER BOSS
WHEN SHE GOT THE CALL.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.779
LET'S TALK TO HIM

11:51.812 --> 11:53.380
AND FIND OUT IF HE KNEW
WHERE HER HEAD WAS.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.084
- YOU'LL HAVE TO TALK TO
IAN WOFFORD BY YOURSELF.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.418
- WHY?

11:58.451 --> 12:00.353
- HE'S MY BOSS TOO.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.525
- PAGE FERGUSON'S DEATH
IS A REAL LOSS,

12:05.558 --> 12:06.593
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

12:06.626 --> 12:09.429
- PAGE RECEIVED A PHONE CALL
HERE IN YOUR OFFICE

12:09.462 --> 12:11.231
RIGHT BEFORE
SHE LEFT THE BUILDING.

12:11.264 --> 12:12.866
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.

12:12.900 --> 12:15.969
SHE HUNG UP, APOLOGIZED
TO ME, AND RAN OUT.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.437
WAS SHE KILLED
BY THE CALLER?

12:17.470 --> 12:22.209
- NO, RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS
LIKE SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE.

12:24.477 --> 12:26.313
WAS SHE
UPSET ABOUT ANYTHING?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.148
STRESSED, WORRIED?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.117
- YOU JUST DESCRIBED

12:30.150 --> 12:32.485
EVERY PROSECUTOR
IN THE BUILDING.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.754
- AND YOU DIDN'T
ANSWER MY QUESTION.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.960
[door closing]

12:39.993 --> 12:42.262
- I DON'T WANT THIS
GETTING OUT.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.564
PAGE IS DEAD AND
CAN'T DEFEND HERSELF.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.400
- SHE'S BEING INVESTIGATED.

12:47.434 --> 12:50.838
- THE FEDERAL INQUIRY
WAS LOOKING INTO HER UNIT

12:50.871 --> 12:53.240
OVER MISSING DRUG MONEY.
- TAKEN FROM EVIDENCE?

12:53.273 --> 12:56.409
- NEVER LOGGED IN.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.280
WE BUSTED A DEALER WITH
15 KILOS, SEVERAL HANDGUNS,

13:00.313 --> 13:02.382
AND 700 GRAND
IN SMALL BILLS.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.052
HE CLAIMED CASH ON HAND
WAS $1.2 MILLION,

13:05.085 --> 13:06.553
AND THAT
OUR COPS STOLE THE REST.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.088
- WHO GOT THE COLLAR?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.823
- PAGE.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.591
AND THREE DETECTIVE
INVESTIGATORS,

13:11.624 --> 13:13.861
SEAN RIGGS...

13:13.894 --> 13:17.230
MICHAEL WALDEN...

13:17.264 --> 13:18.932
AND SUNNY QADRI.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.100
- THEY TAKE POLYGRAPHS?

13:20.133 --> 13:23.570
- RIGGS AND WALDEN PASSED,
PAGE SHOWED SOME DECEPTION.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.338
ABOUT WHAT,
WE CAN'T BE SURE.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.540
- WHAT ABOUT SUNNY?

13:27.574 --> 13:29.843
- SHE REFUSED TO TAKE ONE.

13:33.613 --> 13:35.215
- YOU THINK
THAT SUNNY AND PAGE

13:35.248 --> 13:37.317
WERE IN ON IT TOGETHER.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.320
- QUACKS LIKE A DUCK,
DETECTIVE.

13:40.353 --> 13:41.889
FOLLOW THE MONEY.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.166
- NOSE DIVE.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.135
- BROOKLYN D.A.'S
CUTTING THEIR LOSSES.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.504
FEDS ARE INVESTIGATING
MAJOR NARCOTICS

13:57.537 --> 13:59.139
FOR A MISSING HALF MIL.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.041
SO THEY LEAKED
PAGE'S DEATH AS A SUICIDE

14:01.074 --> 14:02.943
- BLAME THE DEAD WOMAN.
PROBLEM SOLVED.

14:02.976 --> 14:05.946
- I GOT THE SURVEILLANCE TAPES
FROM BROOKLYN.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.315
PAGE GOT THE CALL,
SHE'S LEAVING WOFFORD'S OFFICE.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.884
WALKING INTO THE HALLWAY.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.587
LEAVING THE BUILDING.

14:14.621 --> 14:16.556
- DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANYBODY'S STALKING HER.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.625
- INTO
THE PARKING STRUCTURE.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.928
LEAVING IN HER CAR.
- WELL, ANY CHANCE

14:20.961 --> 14:22.595
SOMEBODY WAS
IN PAGE'S BACKSEAT?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.031
- WELL, IT LOOKS
LIKE SHE WAS ALONE,

14:24.064 --> 14:26.599
BUT IN A HURRY.
- ANY FLAGS ON HER FINANCIALS?

14:26.633 --> 14:28.301
- OH, PAGE
WAS DROWNING IN DEBT.

14:28.335 --> 14:32.539
FROM STUDENT LOANS,
CREDIT CARDS, AND MEDICAL BILLS.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.374
- CANCER FREE BUT CASH POOR.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.976
I'D BE TEMPTED
BY THE DRUG MONEY TOO.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.244
- IT DOESN'T
MAKE HER A THIEF.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.946
- EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT SHE PAID OFF

14:38.979 --> 14:42.082
HALF OF THOSE BILLS...
WITH MONEY ORDERS PURCHASED

14:42.115 --> 14:44.017
FROM A POST OFFICE BOX
IN RED HOOK,

14:44.051 --> 14:46.519
AND CHECK CASHING PLACES
ALL OVER THE BRONX.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.388
- DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
- FOR SUNNY EITHER.

14:48.421 --> 14:49.957
SHE REFUSED
A LIE DETECTOR.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.358
MAYBE SHE'S DIRTY TOO.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.027
- IT'S TIME WE TALKED TO
THE REST OF THE UNIT ABOUT IT.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.229
- DID YOU TRACE
THE DISPOSABLE CELL

14:56.263 --> 14:58.665
THEY USED TO LURE PAGE OUT?
- SERIAL NUMBER WAS SHIPPED

14:58.698 --> 15:00.433
TO AN ELECTRONIC STORE
IN MIDTOWN.

15:00.467 --> 15:04.504
I CALLED THEM AND TOLD THEM
TO PULL THE SECURITY TAPES.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.140
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA, I CALLED YOU
ABOUT THOSE SURVEILLANCE TAPES.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.675
- DON'T YOU PEOPLE TALK
TO EACH OTHER?

15:08.708 --> 15:10.177
HEY!
I'M WATCHING YOU.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.279
- JUST GIVE ME THE TAPES AND
I'M OUTTA YOUR HAIR.

15:12.312 --> 15:13.613
- I GAVE THEM
TO THE OTHER COP.

15:13.646 --> 15:15.282
REAL HOT NUMBER.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.317
YOU SHOULD TELL HER
TO COME BACK AND SEE ME.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.686
- LET ME GUESS--
TALL, BRUNETTE, ACCENT?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.554
- AND BEDROOM EYES.
JUST MY TYPE.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.090
SET ME UP?
- SHE WOULDN'T LET YOU

15:23.123 --> 15:24.691
TOUCH HER TO WIPE HER ASS.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.326
JUST MAKE ME
A COPY OF THE TAPES.

15:26.359 --> 15:27.460
- SHE TOOK THE ORIGINALS.

15:31.064 --> 15:33.133
- DETECTIVE RIGGS AND WALDEN.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.601
WE GOT THE ORDER
FROM OUR CAPTAIN

15:34.634 --> 15:36.136
THAT YOU WANTED TO SEE US.
- YEAH.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.206
HAVE A SEAT,
I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS.

15:39.239 --> 15:42.042
- FIRST, THE BOSSES TAKE
THE WORD OF A DRUG DEALER.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.677
AND NOW PAGE IS DEAD?
IT STINKS.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.214
- EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT
YOUR PROSECUTOR WAS DIRTY.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.550
- PAGE WOULDN'T RISK
HER CAREER OVER A FEW BUCKS.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.520
- UH, 500K
ISN'T CHUMP CHANGE.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.222
- FEDS ARE ALREADY DIGGING.

15:55.255 --> 15:56.656
IF YOU HAVE PROOF,
WHY TALK TO US?

15:56.689 --> 15:58.391
- 'CAUSE MAYBE
SHE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.692
- HEY, YOU WANT
A WITCH HUNT?

15:59.726 --> 16:01.694
TRANSFER TO I.A.B.,
SWEETHEART.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.130
- OKAY, YOU CAN
HELP ME CLEAR THIS UP

16:03.163 --> 16:04.731
OR THE FEDS CAN
HANG YOU OUT TO DRY.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.666
HONEY.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.635
- I PASSED THE POLY,
SO THEY'RE NOT LOOKING AT ME.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.070
- AND I HAVEN'T MET A COP YET

16:10.103 --> 16:11.338
WHO DOESN'T KNOW
THE TRICKS TO BEAT IT.

16:11.371 --> 16:15.342
- IF YOU'RE TURNING OUR SCREWS,
YOU MUST LIKE SUNNY FOR THIS.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.610
- COULD BE ANY OF YOU.

16:22.682 --> 16:24.317
NOW I UNDERSTAND
THAT PAGE FERGUSON

16:24.351 --> 16:27.454
HAD AN OFFICE ROMANCE.

16:27.487 --> 16:28.688
ANY IDEA WHO?

16:28.721 --> 16:30.590
- NOT A CLUE.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.725
- THOUGHT THIS
WAS A TIGHT UNIT.

16:32.759 --> 16:35.095
- NOT LATELY.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.629
PAGE AND SUNNY
WEREN'T GETTING ALONG.

16:36.663 --> 16:39.432
LOT OF ARGUMENTS,
LOT OF COLD SHOULDERS.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.401
- YOU KNOW WHY?

16:41.434 --> 16:42.535
- ASK SUNNY.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.210
- WALDEN?

16:50.243 --> 16:53.046
DO YOU KNOW WHY THEY
WERE AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS?

16:53.080 --> 16:56.083
- MAYBE ONE OF THEM
HAD A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.351
MAYBE THE OTHER ONE HAD
TO STOP HER FROM SQUAWKING.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.486
- YOU KNOW, MY PARTNER'S NEW.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.090
SUNNY'S A STAND-UP COP.
SHE WOULD NEVER CROSS THE LINE.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.463
[phone ringing]

17:14.101 --> 17:15.502
- WHERE'S
DETECTIVE QADRI NOW?

17:15.535 --> 17:17.270
- SHE'S WITH THE FEDS.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.343
- OLIVIA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:23.376 --> 17:26.179
- SALIYAH QADRI,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

17:26.213 --> 17:28.148
FOR EVIDENCE TAMPERING
AND OBSTRUCTION.

17:28.181 --> 17:29.816
- I WAS GOING
TO HAND OVER THE TAPES--

17:29.849 --> 17:31.851
- YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
TAKEN THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.553
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
YOU CANNOT ARREST HER

17:33.586 --> 17:36.223
IF I DON'T FILE CHARGES.
- IT'S NOT UP TO YOU, CHRIS.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.291
- PAGE FERGUSON'S DEATH
IS TIED TO MY INVESTIGATION

17:38.325 --> 17:40.360
INTO MISSING DRUG MONEY.
I AM TAKING OVER.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.861
- SHE TAMPERED
WITH MY VICTIM'S BODY,

17:41.894 --> 17:43.763
SHE LIED TO THE POLICE,
AND SHE STOLE

17:43.796 --> 17:46.199
SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE OF WHOEVER
LURED PAGE TO HER DEATH.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.567
- TAKING THE TAPES
IS SUGGESTIVE,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.136
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR AN ARREST.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.171
- SHE'S GOING IN, CHRIS,
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.272
- THIS CASE
BELONGS TO THE FBI.

17:52.305 --> 17:55.842
- SEND ME THE PAPERWORK.
LET'S GO.

17:55.875 --> 17:59.179
- [chuckles]
AFTER YOU.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.881
- I TOOK THE FOOTAGE
BECAUSE I WANTED TO KNOW

18:01.914 --> 18:03.683
WHO KILLED
MY COLLEAGUE AND FRIEND.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.285
- THAT'S A NICE SPIN,
BUT I'M NOT BUYING.

18:05.318 --> 18:07.187
- EVEN IF I FOUND OUT WHO?

18:09.656 --> 18:11.191
THE PHONE WAS SOLD

18:11.224 --> 18:14.227
TO A HOOD RAT
NAMED LAKEISHA WATKINS.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.762
THE STORE OWNER
SAYS SHE'S A REGULAR.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.665
I RAN HER NAME
AND GOT A HIT.

18:18.698 --> 18:20.833
- YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME
YOU WERE UNDER INVESTIGATION.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.702
- YOU WOULD'VE
CUT ME OUT OF YOUR CASE.

18:22.735 --> 18:24.337
- SO WHAT
SET YOU OFF, SUNNY?

18:26.373 --> 18:28.275
WAS IT PAGE
FAILING THE POLYGRAPH TEST?

18:28.308 --> 18:30.810
OR DID SHE GET COLD FEET
AND WANNA MAKE A DEAL?

18:30.843 --> 18:32.745
- THERE WAS
NOTHING TO CONFESS.

18:32.779 --> 18:34.247
- BUT SHE WAS
GONNA TURN YOU IN.

18:34.281 --> 18:36.449
YOU WOULD'VE LOST
YOUR JOB,

18:36.483 --> 18:38.485
YOUR PENSION,
YOUR FREEDOM.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.687
- PAGE DIDN'T TAKE THE MONEY,
NEITHER DID I.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.789
- SHE PAID OFF HER DEBTS
WITH THE MONEY ORDERS.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.291
AND THAT'S WHEN YOU SNAPPED.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.326
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU CUT HER UP,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.295
YOU TOSSED HER
OFF THAT BUILDING,

18:48.328 --> 18:49.362
AND YOU STAGED
THE CRIME SCENE.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.763
- IT'S A SET-UP!

18:50.797 --> 18:52.199
ANYONE COULD
BUY MONEY ORDERS

18:52.232 --> 18:54.601
AND MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE SHE STOLE THE CASH.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.803
- BY PAYING HER BILLS?
- A DEALER ONCE TRIED

18:56.836 --> 18:59.306
TO DEPOSIT MONEY
IN MY BANK ACCOUNT.

18:59.339 --> 19:03.410
TO SKIP ON A DRUG CHARGE,
MAKE A COP LOOK BAD.

19:03.443 --> 19:05.812
- SOME COPS ARE CROOKED.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.181
I'M LOOKING AT ONE
RIGHT NOW.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.618
- I DIDN'T TAKE THE MONEY,

19:11.651 --> 19:14.621
AND I DIDN'T KILL PAGE.
- OKAY.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.424
OKAY.

19:17.457 --> 19:19.559
SO WHY NOT
TAKE THE POLYGRAPH?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.961
- IT WAS A SLAP IN THE FACE.

19:21.994 --> 19:27.334
25 YEARS ON THE JOB,
NOT EVEN ONE ACCUSATION.

19:27.367 --> 19:30.203
THEN MY REPUTATION GETS
BLOWN TO HELL

19:30.237 --> 19:32.472
FOR A LOW-LIFE SCUM BAG.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.341
IF THEY THOUGHT
I WAS GUILTY,

19:34.374 --> 19:37.377
THEY WERE
GONNA HAVE TO PROVE IT.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.382
- SO WHY BOTHER
TO TAKE IT NOW?

19:42.415 --> 19:46.286
- IT WAS THE ONLY WAY
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.321
THE UNIT'S UNDER
A CLOUD OF SUSPICION,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.257
THEN PAGE GETS KILLED...

19:50.290 --> 19:53.393
I HAD TO PROVE THAT
NO ONE ON OUR TEAM'S DIRTY.

20:06.306 --> 20:07.674
- SATISFIED?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.609
- NOT TILL I FIND
PAGE FERGUSON'S MURDERER.

20:09.642 --> 20:13.380
- SUNNY SHOWED NO SIGNS
OF HESITATION OR DECEPTION,

20:13.413 --> 20:14.447
SHE PASSED THE POLY.

20:14.481 --> 20:15.548
- SO DID RIGGS AND WALDEN.

20:15.582 --> 20:16.983
- WHICH JUST LEAVES
THE VICTIM.

20:17.016 --> 20:18.351
- [sigh]

20:18.385 --> 20:20.453
IT'S PROBABLY
WHAT GOT PAGE KILLED.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.855
- UNLESS SHE REALLY DID
COMMIT SUICIDE.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.557
- WELL, IF SHE DID,
SHE HAD HELP.

20:24.591 --> 20:25.825
LAKEISHA WATKINS.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.627
THIS GIRL
BOUGHT THE BURN PHONE.

20:27.660 --> 20:30.497
POSSESSION, RESISTING,
AND ILLEGAL WEAPONS CHARGES.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.499
- THE GIRL LIKES KNIVES.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.535
- PICK HER UP.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.043
- WHAT'S LAKEISHA DOING

20:44.076 --> 20:46.379
WITH BROOKLYN SNITCH
DAMON MERCED?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.947
- LET'S ASK
BEFORE THEY TAKE OFF.

20:47.980 --> 20:50.049
- HEY, STOP.
POLICE.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.284
OH!

20:51.318 --> 20:52.519
DROP THE KNIFE!

20:52.552 --> 20:53.653
- LEAVE!
I DON'T KNOW YOU.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.788
- YOU WANT AN
OPEN OR CLOSED CASKET?

20:59.091 --> 21:02.295
- DROP THE GUN!
DROP THE GUN!

21:02.329 --> 21:04.331
NOW!
[sirens blare]

21:04.364 --> 21:07.066
[tires squealing]
- WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

21:07.099 --> 21:08.735
- I'M ON THE JOB,
PUT YOUR PIECE AWAY.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.638
- YOU PUT YOUR PIECE DOWN!
- RELAX!

21:11.671 --> 21:13.306
RELAX, RELAX.
PUT YOUR WEAPON DOWN.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.007
PUT YOUR WEAPON DOWN.

21:19.546 --> 21:20.980
- RIGGS, WHAT GAME
ARE YOU PLAYING?

21:21.013 --> 21:22.048
- I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU.

21:22.081 --> 21:23.850
LOCAL COPS
ARE MOVING MY WITNESS

21:23.883 --> 21:25.552
TO A SAFER LOCATION,
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

21:25.585 --> 21:27.820
- WE CAME TO QUESTION
LAKEISHA ABOUT PAGE'S MURDER.

21:27.854 --> 21:29.322
- WHAT WOULD
SHE KNOW ABOUT IT?

21:29.356 --> 21:30.790
- SHE LURED
PAGE FROM THE OFFICE

21:30.823 --> 21:32.091
AND NOW HERE SHE IS
WITH RIVERA'S RAT.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.460
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

21:33.493 --> 21:34.961
- YOU NEED
TO BRING HIM BACK HERE

21:34.994 --> 21:35.995
OR EITHER DELIVER HIM
TO OUR PRECINCT.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.798
- THE ONLY PLACE I'M
TAKING DAMON IS TO COURT.

21:38.831 --> 21:42.635
YOU GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT,
CALL THE BROOKLYN D.A.

21:48.941 --> 21:51.344
- LATIN KINGS PUT
A PRICE ON DAMON'S HEAD.

21:51.378 --> 21:54.381
YOU CAN TALK TO LAKEISHA...

22:07.727 --> 22:10.730
- IT TOOK HOURS
TO CUT HER UP, RIGGS.

22:18.438 --> 22:21.140
SOMEBODY DROVE PAGE
ACROSS STATE LINES,

22:21.173 --> 22:24.377
TORTURED HER,
THEN THREW HER OFF THE ROOF.

22:29.148 --> 22:32.819
- I READ
THE CORONER'S REPORT, SUNNY.

22:32.852 --> 22:36.489
PAGE DID IT TO HERSELF.
SHE JUMPED.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.991
- THE CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS INCONCLUSIVE.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.927
- DAMON USED HIS GIRLFRIEND

22:40.960 --> 22:43.963
TO LURE PAGE
FROM THIS BUILDING.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.765
DON'T YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

22:45.798 --> 22:48.935
- YOU REALLY
THINK HE DID THIS?

22:48.968 --> 22:52.138
- YOUR SNITCH
HELD A GUN TO MY HEAD.

22:52.171 --> 22:53.673
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

22:53.706 --> 22:55.174
- THAT HE BETTER
HAVE A DAMN GOOD STORY

22:55.207 --> 22:58.044
WHEN I HAND HIM TO YOU.

22:59.546 --> 23:02.515
- WHY DID YOU CALL PAGE FERGUSON
ON THE NIGHT SHE DIED?

23:02.549 --> 23:04.083
- DAMON WAS FREAKING OUT.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.586
SAID HE SAW ONE OF HIS OLD CREW
AND WE WASN'T SAFE.

23:06.619 --> 23:08.921
- WELL, RIGGS IS HIS HANDLER,
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.657
- TRIED HIM FIRST,
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

23:10.690 --> 23:11.924
COULDN'T FIND HIM.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.693
- WHY DIDN'T DAMON
MAKE THE CALL HIMSELF?

23:13.726 --> 23:15.795
- I DON'T TALK ON THE PHONE,
THAT'S HOW YOU GET PINCHED.

23:15.828 --> 23:18.498
- BUT WHY HAVE LAKEISHA
CALL THE VICTIM?

23:18.531 --> 23:20.533
- VICTIM?
THAT BITCH KILLED HERSELF.

23:20.567 --> 23:23.202
- ANSWER THE DAMN QUESTION,
MERCED.

23:23.235 --> 23:25.171
- LAKEISHA
CALLED MY HANDLER FIRST.

23:25.204 --> 23:26.839
WHEN HE DIDN'T PICK UP,

23:26.873 --> 23:29.476
I TOLD HER CALL THE OFFICE
AND TALK TO HIS WOMAN.

23:32.945 --> 23:35.848
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT
RIGGS AND PAGE WERE A COUPLE?

23:35.882 --> 23:36.683
- NOBODY.

23:36.716 --> 23:38.184
I CALLED HIM AT HOME
LATE ONE NIGHT,

23:38.217 --> 23:39.619
AND SHE ANSWERED THE PHONE.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.721
SHE SOUNDED
JUST LIKE LAKEISHA

23:41.754 --> 23:43.456
AFTER I WAS DONE
GIVING HER A GOOD POUNDING.

23:43.490 --> 23:48.895
- I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID THAT
YOU NEVER USE THE PHONE?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.196
- DID PAGE
OFFER TO PICK YOU UP?

23:50.229 --> 23:52.665
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
NEVER SHOWED.

23:52.699 --> 23:54.834
- HOW LONG YOU WAIT?
- COUPLE HOURS.

23:54.867 --> 23:56.803
- WHAT KIND OF CAR WAS
PAGE DRIVING?

23:56.836 --> 23:58.671
- A BLACK SUV.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.907
- HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT
IF SHE NEVER SHOWED?

24:05.545 --> 24:07.547
- SHE TOLD ME
WHAT TO LOOK FOR.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.182
- SO WHERE'D YOU GO
AFTER PAGE STOOD YOU UP?

24:10.216 --> 24:11.818
- WE SPLIT UP.
I TOLD MY GIRL,

24:11.851 --> 24:13.720
"GO HOME AND
JUST STAY OUT OF SIGHT."

24:13.753 --> 24:15.187
- AND YOU DIDN'T
CALL THE OFFICE BACK

24:15.221 --> 24:16.856
HOPING TO GET
SOMEBODY ELSE TO HELP YOU?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.625
- I DON'T
KNOW ANYBODY ELSE.

24:18.658 --> 24:22.128
I KEPT MY HEAD DOWN,
AND I JUST KEPT IT MOVING.

24:22.161 --> 24:25.565
LOOK, I'M A SURVIVOR,
AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.700
- YOU AND THE COCKROACHES.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.939
- COME ON,
BACK TO THE SAFEHOUSE

24:37.009 --> 24:38.678
- I HOPE DAMON'S
MORE CREDIBLE ON THE STAND

24:38.711 --> 24:39.946
THAN HE WAS
IN THAT INTERVIEW.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.814
- HE'S NOT
THE ONLY LYING BASTARD.

24:41.848 --> 24:44.551
RIGGS WAS INVOLVED WITH PAGE
AND SMACKING HER AROUND.

24:44.584 --> 24:45.885
WE NEED TO SIT HIM DOWN.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.787
- NOT ON THE WORD
OF SOME PISSANT INFORMANT.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.622
- WHERE WAS RIGGS
WHEN PAGE WENT MISSING?

24:49.656 --> 24:51.758
- IN THE OFFICE.
I SAW HIM RIGHT BEFORE

24:51.791 --> 24:52.992
I REALIZED PAGE WAS GONE.

24:53.025 --> 24:54.627
HE WAS LEAVING
FOR THE NIGHT.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.596
- LAB CHECK THE KNIFE
LAKEISHA PULLED ON ME.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.164
IT DOESN'T MATCH
THE VICTIM'S WOUNDS.

24:58.197 --> 24:59.632
- IT'S GONNA BE
TOUGH TO PROVE MURDER

24:59.666 --> 25:02.134
WITHOUT MORE EVIDENCE.
- BUT WHY KILL PAGE?

25:02.168 --> 25:04.103
DAMON IS A WITNESS
FOR THE PROSECUTION,

25:04.136 --> 25:05.572
WHAT DOES HE
GAIN BY HER DEATH?

25:05.605 --> 25:07.940
- I RAN
RIGGS' PHONE RECORDS.

25:07.974 --> 25:10.577
NOT ONE INCOMING CALL
TO HIS WORK OR CELL

25:10.610 --> 25:11.878
FROM LAKEISHA'S BURN PHONE.

25:11.911 --> 25:13.713
- PROVES THEY'RE LYING,
BUT DOESN'T PUT THEM

25:13.746 --> 25:15.815
IN THE SAME
ABANDONED BUILDING WITH HER.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.651
- NO HAIR,
NO FIBERS, NO PRINTS.

25:18.685 --> 25:22.789
IT WAS COLD, THEY HAD TO
BE WRAPPED UP IN WINTER GEAR.

25:22.822 --> 25:25.825
- UNLESS THEY WERE
SITTING IN A HEATED CAR.

25:28.661 --> 25:30.162
TELL ME
YOU HAVE SOMETHING, JUDY.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.764
- WE FOUND
A SMALL POOL OF BLOOD

25:31.798 --> 25:32.999
BELONGING TO THE VICTIM

25:33.032 --> 25:37.837
BEHIND THE DRIVER'S SEAT
AND UNDER THE MAT.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.772
- THE KILLER FORCED PAGE
INTO THE BACK SEAT

25:39.806 --> 25:41.641
TO SLASH HER UP.
- BASED ON HER WOUNDS,

25:41.674 --> 25:43.610
THERE SHOULD'VE BEEN
A LOT MORE BLOOD ON THE SEAT.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.844
WE DIDN'T FIND ANY.

25:44.877 --> 25:46.312
- BECAUSE SHE
WAS SITTING ON PLASTIC.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.648
- THAT'S WHAT I'M GUESSING.
NO OFFENSE TO WARNER,

25:48.681 --> 25:52.685
BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE A HOMICIDE TO ME.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.286
- GOT ANYTHING
TO BACK THAT UP?

25:54.320 --> 25:57.624
- THIS TOLL RECEIPT.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.925
- WELL, IT'S FADED.
HOW CAN YOU TELL?

25:58.958 --> 26:00.092
- POINT OF SALE,

26:00.126 --> 26:02.094
THERMAL PAPER
FADES WHEN IT HEATS UP.

26:02.128 --> 26:05.364
SO WE COPIED THE IMAGE,
THEN USED INFRARED AND UV LIGHT.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.333
RECEIPT WAS PRINTED
AT A TOLL BOOTH

26:07.366 --> 26:09.001
HEADING INTO NEW JERSEY
AT 2:00 A.M.

26:09.035 --> 26:10.236
- THERE'S BLOOD ON IT.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.604
- YEAH, BUT
IT'S NOT THE VICTIM'S.

26:11.638 --> 26:13.105
WE RAN IT THROUGH CODIS,
NO HITS.

26:13.139 --> 26:16.709
- THE TICKET IS TIME-STAMPED,
AND THE BOOTHS HAVE CAMERAS.

26:16.743 --> 26:19.045
LET'S PULL THE FOOTAGE
AND FIND THIS KILLER.

26:22.715 --> 26:25.251
- ANY SIGN OF PAGE'S CAR?
- NOTHING YET.

26:25.284 --> 26:26.619
THERE'S A LOT OF TRAFFIC
ON THE ROAD

26:26.653 --> 26:27.920
AT 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.288
- SO WHERE ARE WE?

26:29.321 --> 26:30.890
- WE THOUGHT PAGE
WAS DRIVING THE CAR ALONE,

26:30.923 --> 26:33.225
BUT THE BLOOD ON THE TOLL
RECEIPT ISN'T HERS?

26:33.259 --> 26:34.961
- SO WHO WAS IN THE CAR
WITH HER?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.663
- MAYBE HER BOYFRIEND, RIGGS.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.965
- YOU THINK THAT HE GOT TIRED
OF SLAPPING PAGE AROUND?

26:38.998 --> 26:41.834
DECIDED TO END THEIR
RELATIONSHIP ONCE AND FOR ALL?

26:41.868 --> 26:42.902
- THE GUY SEEMS ON EDGE.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.737
HE'S DEFINITELY
HIDING SOMETHING.

26:44.771 --> 26:47.239
- MY BET'S ON HIM.
- YOU LOST YOUR BET.

26:47.273 --> 26:50.142
LOOK WHO'S DRIVING
PAGE'S CAR.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.378
- THAT'S PAGE'S SNITCH,
DAMON MERCED.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.013
- PAGE'S OFFICE
IS PROTECTING HIM.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.381
WHY WOULD HE KILL HER?

26:55.414 --> 26:59.952
- GO ASK THE RAT BASTARD.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.655
- I ASKED FOR DAMON'S
LOCATION, NOT YOU.

27:02.689 --> 27:04.891
YOU CAN'T COVER UP
FOR YOUR INFORMANT THIS TIME.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.392
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.
YOU DON'T GET TO COLLAR

27:06.425 --> 27:08.427
THE SCUMBAG WHO KILLED PAGE
RIGHT UNDER MY NOSE.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.296
- DON'T EXPECT ME
TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES.

27:10.329 --> 27:11.230
SHE WAS MY FRIEND.

27:11.263 --> 27:13.099
- THAT'S WHY YOU
SHOULDN'T BE HERE, SUNNY.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.801
- FORGET IT.
- BY THE BOOK.

27:14.834 --> 27:17.837
- UH-HUH.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.641
- THIS DOOR'S
BEEN KICKED IN.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.886
SOMEBODY
EMPTIED A CLIP IN THEM,

27:33.920 --> 27:36.022
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THEY'VE BEEN DEAD FOR A WHILE.

27:36.055 --> 27:37.857
- IT WOULD'VE BEEN LOUD.

27:37.890 --> 27:38.958
HAD TO HAVE WITNESSES.

27:38.991 --> 27:40.893
- IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD,

27:40.927 --> 27:42.461
YOU'D BE LUCKY IF
ANYONE ANSWERS THE DOOR.

27:42.494 --> 27:46.065
- BULLETS TRAVEL.
SOME CITIZENS COULD BE HURT.

27:46.098 --> 27:48.868
- ANYONE ELSE KNOW
THEY WERE STASHED HERE

27:48.901 --> 27:50.036
BESIDES YOU?

27:52.805 --> 27:54.206
- WHAT, ARE YOU
ACCUSING ME OF SOMETHING?

27:54.240 --> 27:55.842
- THEY KILLED PAGE.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.844
YOU WERE IN ON IT TOGETHER
AND HAD TO SHUT THEM UP.

27:57.877 --> 28:00.246
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- HEY, KNOCK IT OFF, SUNNY.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.048
- WHAT THE HELL'S
WRONG WITH YOU?

28:02.081 --> 28:03.916
- WHY DID YOU DO IT?
WHY KILL PAGE?

28:03.950 --> 28:05.985
- HEY, I GOT
NO PROBLEM HITTING A WOMAN

28:06.018 --> 28:07.453
SO I SUGGEST
YOU GET OUT OF MY WAY.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.856
- CALM DOWN.
STEP ASIDE.

28:13.492 --> 28:16.695
I WOULDN'T GO TOO FAR.

28:29.475 --> 28:34.146
- FOUND GOD?
- DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS LOST.

28:34.180 --> 28:37.049
A NEIGHBOR TURNED IT IN.
SLUGS IN THE SPINE.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.851
- YOU SHOULDN'T BE
HERE, SUNNY.

28:38.885 --> 28:40.119
- WHAT DIFFERENCE
DOES IT MAKE?

28:40.152 --> 28:41.921
- YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
YOU CAN'T WORK A CASE

28:41.954 --> 28:43.022
OUTSIDE
OF YOUR JURISDICTION.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.156
YOU GOTTA HIT THE BRICKS.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.058
- FINE.
BUT IF I WERE YOU,

28:46.092 --> 28:47.760
I'D CHECK THE DUMPSTER.

28:47.794 --> 28:48.995
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
THE SAME NEIGHBOR?

28:49.028 --> 28:50.897
- HIS TEN-YEAR-OLD SON.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.933
DON'T MAKE THE BOY
A TARGET, FIN.

28:57.336 --> 29:00.339
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME, KID?

29:02.141 --> 29:04.343
DON'T WANNA TALK TO ME?

29:04.376 --> 29:05.511
- NO.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.013
- LOOK, I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE SCARED.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.148
BUT YOU GOTTA
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

29:09.181 --> 29:12.785
- MY DAD'S UPSET.

29:12.819 --> 29:14.020
HE SAYS WE GOTTA MOVE.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.788
- WHY?
'CAUSE YOU SAW WHO DID IT?

29:15.822 --> 29:18.825
- HE SAW ME
WHEN HE DUMPED THE GUN.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.093
- OKAY,
WHAT'D HE LOOK LIKE?

29:21.127 --> 29:22.194
- BORIQUA.

29:22.228 --> 29:26.165
HE HAD A SNAKE ON HIS NECK,
BLACK AND GOLD BEADS.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.067
HE'S GONNA COME BACK
AND KILL ME, ISN'T HE?

29:28.100 --> 29:30.937
- NOT UNLESS
HE HAS A DEATH WISH.

29:30.970 --> 29:34.040
LISTEN, I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYTHING HAPPEN TO YOU, OKAY?

29:34.073 --> 29:35.975
COME ON.

29:38.978 --> 29:41.480
- 26 .9 MILLIMETER
SHELL CASINGS.

29:41.513 --> 29:43.916
- HOW MANY SHOOTERS?
- MY GUESS?

29:43.950 --> 29:44.750
ONE.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.585
PRELIMINARY EXAM
OF LANDS AND GROOVES

29:46.618 --> 29:48.254
SAYS THEY ALL
CAME FROM THE SAME GUN.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.889
- THE SHOOTER HAD TO RELOAD.

29:49.922 --> 29:54.260
- PROBABLY USED
A MAC-10 WITH A FULL MAGAZINE.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.863
- WHERE'D YOU GET THAT?
- THE KID LED ME TO IT.

29:56.896 --> 29:59.131
- IS HE WILLING TO TALK?
- WELL, I TOLD HIM NOT TO.

29:59.165 --> 30:03.435
- FIN, HE HAS TO COME FORWARD
TO GET PROTECTION.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.371
- I GOT THIS COVERED.

30:05.404 --> 30:08.407
- DETECTIVES...

30:11.210 --> 30:13.479
- THIS IS PAGE FERGUSON'S
PEN KNIFE,

30:13.512 --> 30:14.847
WHERE'D YOU GET THIS?

30:14.881 --> 30:16.849
- IN LAKEISHA WATKINS' PURSE.

30:21.220 --> 30:22.922
- WE HAD THEM
AND WE LET THEM GO.

30:27.093 --> 30:29.996
- LAB REPORT, THE BLOOD SAMPLE
AND THE TOLL RECEIPT

30:30.029 --> 30:31.563
BELONGS TO LAKEISHA WATKINS.

30:31.597 --> 30:33.165
- WELL, I GUESS HER DEATH
IS ONE WAY

30:33.199 --> 30:34.500
FOR PAGE TO GET JUSTICE.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.502
- WE STILL GOTTA
FIND THE SHOOTER, LIV.

30:36.535 --> 30:37.569
THE KID I TALKED TO SAID

30:37.603 --> 30:39.305
HE SAW A LATIN KING
DUMP THAT GUN.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.539
BUT I WANNA
KEEP HIM OUT OF IT.

30:40.572 --> 30:42.108
- OH, I'M WITH YOU.
THERE'S NO NEED

30:42.141 --> 30:44.443
FOR HIM TO RISK HIS LIFE
BEFORE IT'S EVEN STARTED.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.378
- OKAY.
LAKEISHA AND DAMON

30:46.412 --> 30:48.080
WERE IN A SECRET LOCATION.

30:48.114 --> 30:49.982
SOMEBODY HAD
TO FEED THEM THE ADDRESS.

30:50.016 --> 30:52.018
- PROBABLY THE SAME PERSON
WHO ARRANGED PAGE'S MURDER.

30:52.051 --> 30:55.054
- SHE WAS SET UP.

30:59.425 --> 31:01.527
- DAMON SLIPPED
HIS ELECTRONIC BRACELET,

31:01.560 --> 31:03.129
SLAP ON THE WRIST.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.564
ARRESTED FOR DRUGS,
VACATED.

31:05.597 --> 31:07.466
PINCHED WITH A GUN,
VACATED.

31:07.499 --> 31:11.103
- SOMEBODY'S
LOOKING OUT FOR HIM.

31:11.137 --> 31:12.571
- HIS HANDLER.

31:12.604 --> 31:15.274
SEAN RIGGS.

31:15.307 --> 31:18.510
SO DAMON LURES PAGE,
DRIVES AROUND FOR HOURS

31:18.544 --> 31:20.612
WHILE THE GIRLFRIEND SITS IN
THE BACK AND CUTS HER UP.

31:20.646 --> 31:22.448
- MOST BANGERS
DON'T GET OFF ON TORTURE,

31:22.481 --> 31:24.050
BUT HE WANTED THAT DRUG MONEY.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.417
- PAGE IS A CUTTER.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.154
SHE HAS A HIGH
THRESHOLD FOR PAIN.

31:28.187 --> 31:30.056
WHEN THE SERVICE OPERATOR
SPOOKS THEM,

31:30.089 --> 31:31.190
THEY HAVE TO
GET OUT OF THE CAR--

31:31.223 --> 31:34.560
- THEN THEY PUSHED HER OFF
A BUILDING TO SHUT HER UP.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.128
YOU THINK RIGGS
MIGHT'VE LET IT SLIP

31:36.162 --> 31:38.064
THAT PAGE
STOLE THAT DRUG MONEY?

31:38.097 --> 31:40.166
- THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

31:40.199 --> 31:43.035
HE NEEDED HER
TO TAKE THE FALL.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.077
- I NEED A UNION REP.

31:51.110 --> 31:54.113
- WE CAN WAIT FOR ONE OR
YOU CAN CLEAR THIS UP RIGHT NOW.

31:57.149 --> 31:58.350
- WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

31:58.384 --> 32:00.286
- HOW THE LATIN KINGS
FOUND YOUR INFORMANT.

32:00.319 --> 32:01.988
- IF YOU THINK
I LEAKED HIS LOCATION,

32:02.021 --> 32:03.089
FORGET IT,
I DON'T OPERATE THAT WAY.

32:03.122 --> 32:06.025
- YOU HAD YOUR INFORMANT
KILL A D.A. FOR DRUG MONEY.

32:06.058 --> 32:07.659
DAMON WAS YOUR WEAKEST LINK,
SO HE HAD TO GO.

32:07.693 --> 32:09.195
- THAT'S A LIE.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.230
OKAY, I HAD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH PAGE.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.198
I LOVED HER.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.266
- YOU HAD SEX WITH HER
AND YOU ABUSED HER,

32:14.300 --> 32:15.134
I WOULDN'T CALL THAT LOVE.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.104
- WE WERE TOGETHER
FOR ALMOST A YEAR.

32:18.137 --> 32:20.106
ALL RIGHT, I HAD
TO SNEAK INTO THE HOSPITAL

32:20.139 --> 32:22.241
WHEN SHE HAD CANCER.

32:22.274 --> 32:24.710
NOW SHE'S GONE,
I CAN'T EVEN GRIEVE.

32:24.743 --> 32:27.046
- WHY THE BIG SECRET?
- SHE WAS THE HEAD OF OUR UNIT,

32:27.079 --> 32:28.347
HOW WOULD IT LOOK
IF WE WENT PUBLIC?

32:28.380 --> 32:29.448
- AND THAT UPSET YOU.

32:29.481 --> 32:32.084
SHE EMASCULATED YOU,
ORDERING YOU AROUND THE OFFICE.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.085
SO YOU SLAPPED HER
AROUND AT HOME.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.254
- I NEVER TOUCHED HER.
- YOU SAID IT YOURSELF,

32:35.287 --> 32:36.288
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM
HITTING WOMEN.

32:36.322 --> 32:38.390
- WHO COME AT ME!
OKAY, YOU WEAR THE UNIFORM,

32:38.424 --> 32:40.692
FEMALES ARE THE FIRST ONES
TO TRY TO TAKE YOU OUT.

32:40.726 --> 32:43.295
SO I WON'T HESITATE
TO PUT A BROAD DOWN HARD.

32:43.329 --> 32:46.265
- OKAY.
SOMEBODY SAW HER BRUISES.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.568
- THAT SHE GAVE TO HERSELF.

32:49.601 --> 32:52.171
I MEAN, SHE'D BEEN
SELF-HARMING FOR YEARS.

32:52.204 --> 32:55.207
- PERFECT WAY TO MAKE
A MURDER LOOK LIKE SUICIDE.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.686
- PAGE WAS
IN AND OUT OF THERAPY.

33:07.719 --> 33:11.190
SHE USED TO
PULL HER EYELASHES,

33:11.223 --> 33:14.226
SLAM HER BODY INTO DOORS.

33:14.260 --> 33:17.596
AND NOBODY COULD EVER
TELL HER WHY.

33:17.629 --> 33:22.668
AT FIRST, THEY SAID
THAT HER BRAIN WAS WIRED WRONG.

33:22.701 --> 33:26.072
AND THEN SHE JUST
WANTED THE ATTENTION.

33:26.105 --> 33:28.540
PERSONALITY DISORDERS.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.577
ANXIETY, DEPRESSION.

33:34.746 --> 33:38.384
I WALKED IN ON HER ONCE,
AND SHE HAD...

33:39.851 --> 33:41.587
SHE CUT HER THIGH TOO DEEP.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.324
AND SHE APOLOGIZED TO ME
ALL THE WAY TO THE E.R.

33:45.357 --> 33:46.592
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY,

33:46.625 --> 33:48.260
TILL THE COPS
SHOWED UP TO TAKE ME IN.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.561
YOU CAN CHECK THE 61s.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.463
- WE DID.

33:51.497 --> 33:55.301
THE COPS DIDN'T CLEAR YOU.

33:55.334 --> 33:58.337
- THEY THOUGHT PAGE
WAS A BATTERED WOMAN.

34:00.372 --> 34:03.375
ARGUMENTS AND STRESS
TRIGGERED HER NEED TO CUT.

34:06.378 --> 34:09.115
SHE SAID IT
RELIEVED THE PRESSURE.

34:09.148 --> 34:11.450
YOU KNOW, SHE SWORE
THAT SHE WOULD RESIGN

34:11.483 --> 34:12.551
AFTER THE RIVERA TRIAL.

34:12.584 --> 34:15.254
THAT SHE WOULD
FOCUS ON HER HEALTH.

34:15.287 --> 34:18.290
- YOU THINK
SHE COMMITTED SUICIDE?

34:18.324 --> 34:20.726
- BETWEEN THE MISSING
DRUG MONEY AND THE RIVERA TRIAL,

34:20.759 --> 34:22.328
WHAT WOULD YOU THINK?

34:22.361 --> 34:24.296
- DID PAGE QUESTION YOU
ABOUT THE MONEY?

34:26.632 --> 34:29.701
- I TOOK THE POLY
SO SHE WOULDN'T HAVE TO.

34:32.671 --> 34:35.674
I GUESS IT DIDN'T MATTER
IN THE END.

34:38.277 --> 34:41.280
[knocking]

34:45.884 --> 34:47.786
- ANGEL RIVERA HAD A VISITOR

34:47.819 --> 34:50.256
THE SAME DAY
DAMON AND LAKEISHA GOT KILLED.

34:50.289 --> 34:53.825
- WHO SIGNED
THE VISITOR'S LOG?

34:53.859 --> 34:57.095
- LET'S GO.

34:59.431 --> 35:01.667
- THIS A CONJUGAL VISIT?

35:01.700 --> 35:03.635
- YOU'RE NEVER
HAVING SEX AGAIN.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.138
AT LEAST
NOT THE CONSENTING KIND.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.539
YOU DON'T WANT YOUR LAWYER?

35:07.573 --> 35:09.275
- I DON'T NEED HIM.

35:09.308 --> 35:10.776
PUNK WITNESS IS DEAD.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.678
CHARGES GOTTA BE DROPPED.

35:12.711 --> 35:14.680
CASE CLOSED.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.282
I'M GONNA BE A FREE MAN.

35:16.315 --> 35:17.916
- IN YOUR DREAMS, ANGEL.

35:17.949 --> 35:20.252
COME TO KISS ME
GOOD-BYE, TOO?

35:20.286 --> 35:22.821
- NO, I CAME
TO THROW AWAY THE KEY.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.623
YOU AND YOUR GIRLFRIEND
ARE GONNA BE IN HERE

35:24.656 --> 35:28.427
FOR A LONG TIME.

35:28.460 --> 35:31.730
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, GINA?

35:31.763 --> 35:33.232
- WHAT SHE DOING HERE?

35:33.265 --> 35:34.466
- SAME THING AS YOU.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.869
CONSPIRACY TO COMMIT MURDER.

35:37.903 --> 35:40.472
- STUPID VACA.
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM?

35:40.506 --> 35:44.176
- SHE TOLD US EVERYTHING.
- THEY MADE ME, ANGEL.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.744
- YOU CALLED HER HERE
YESTERDAY.

35:45.777 --> 35:47.513
YOU GAVE HER THE ADDRESS
WHERE DAMON AND LAKEISHA

35:47.546 --> 35:49.181
WERE HIDING,
AND YOU TOLD HER

35:49.215 --> 35:51.517
WHICH ONE OF YOUR LATIN KINGS
WAS GONNA KILL 'EM.

35:51.550 --> 35:52.818
- I DIDN'T DO NONE OF THAT.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.520
- [sobbing]
THEY KNOW, BABY.

35:54.553 --> 35:58.190
- SHE'S LYING.

35:58.224 --> 35:59.825
- SUCH A TRAGEDY.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.593
- WHAT IS?

36:01.627 --> 36:04.763
- THAT YOUR KID
IS GONNA BE BORN IN PRISON.

36:04.796 --> 36:06.865
BOTH PARENTS DOING TIME.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.500
NO REAL FAMILY,
IN THE SYSTEM,

36:08.534 --> 36:11.937
AND SCREWED FOR LIFE.

36:11.970 --> 36:15.341
- DOESN'T HAVE TO HAPPEN
THAT WAY.

36:15.374 --> 36:17.276
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:17.309 --> 36:20.912
- WELL, THERE IS ONE THING
THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.350
WHO TOLD YOU WHERE DAMON
AND LAKEISHA WERE HIDING?

36:24.383 --> 36:26.652
- TELL US.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.288
AND GINA WALKS.

36:29.321 --> 36:31.257
- PLEASE...BABY.

36:35.827 --> 36:39.331
- COME ON, ANGEL.

36:39.365 --> 36:43.269
PRISON NURSERIES
DON'T HAVE TOYS.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.882
- THAT BITCH SAID
IF I CLEANED UP HER MESS,

36:56.915 --> 36:59.785
SHE'D CLEAN UP MINE.

36:59.818 --> 37:01.253
- WHICH BITCH?

37:01.287 --> 37:04.723
- YOU LIED, SUNNY.
- THIS SHOCKS YOU?

37:04.756 --> 37:07.993
- YOU DID KNOW DAMON.
YOU ARRESTED HIM IN '95.

37:08.026 --> 37:09.995
- I ARRESTED A LOT OF PEOPLE
OVER THE YEARS.

37:10.028 --> 37:12.798
CAN'T REMEMBER THEM ALL.
- BUT HE WAS YOUR SNITCH.

37:12.831 --> 37:14.833
HE GAVE YOU INFORMATION
AND YOU BAILED HIM OUT.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.902
FOR YEARS,
YOU DID IT OVER AND OVER.

37:16.935 --> 37:20.005
- HE WAS ALMOST AS EASY
TO MANIPULATE AS YOU.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.573
- WANTING TO SEARCH
FOR DRUG MONEY,

37:21.607 --> 37:23.008
YOU WILLING TO COOPERATE?

37:23.041 --> 37:24.943
- SURE.

37:24.976 --> 37:28.647
WHAT ARE
WE TALKING ABOUT,

37:28.680 --> 37:30.516
3 1/2 YEARS?

37:30.549 --> 37:32.684
I'LL DO A YEAR, TOPS.

37:32.718 --> 37:33.785
- LOOKS LIKE YOU
GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT.

37:33.819 --> 37:35.921
- I TOOK THE CASH AND
HOPED YOU WOULDN'T CATCH ME.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.289
I WAS WRONG.

37:37.323 --> 37:38.790
- OH, YOU DID
A LOT MORE THAN HOPE.

37:38.824 --> 37:40.426
YOU INSERTED YOURSELF
IN THE MIDDLE

37:40.459 --> 37:41.593
OF MY INVESTIGATION
FROM THE BEGINNING.

37:41.627 --> 37:42.861
- YOU'RE UPSET.

37:42.894 --> 37:44.763
- PAGE FIGURED OUT
THAT YOU STOLE THE MONEY,

37:44.796 --> 37:46.465
AND SHE ORDERED YOU
TO TURN IT IN.

37:46.498 --> 37:48.300
SHE ACTUALLY CARED
ABOUT YOU.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.702
- NO.
I CARED ABOUT PAGE.

37:50.736 --> 37:52.438
UNLIKE HER,
I PROVED IT EVERY DAY.

37:52.471 --> 37:53.805
- YOU DIDN'T
GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HER.

37:53.839 --> 37:55.541
YOU SOLD HER OUT
FOR THE DRUG MONEY.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.776
- YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.
- I CAN SELL IT.

37:57.809 --> 38:00.746
- PAGE OWED ME.
- HER LIFE?

38:00.779 --> 38:03.382
YOU TOLD YOUR SNITCH
THAT SHE LIFTED THE DRUG MONEY

38:03.415 --> 38:05.083
AND HE KILLED HER FOR IT.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.886
- ASK ME WHY.
- I DON'T NEED TO.

38:07.919 --> 38:09.988
YOU'RE LIKE
EVERY OTHER LOWLIFE

38:10.021 --> 38:11.990
LOOKING FOR AN EASY PAYDAY.
[dog barking]

38:12.023 --> 38:13.091
- DETECTIVE.

38:13.124 --> 38:16.328
[dog whimpers]

38:19.431 --> 38:22.968
- WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW?

38:23.001 --> 38:27.072
PAGE AND I STARTED
TOGETHER IN BROOKLYN.

38:27.105 --> 38:31.009
FEW WOMEN MAKE IT THAT
FAR UP THE FOOD CHAIN

38:31.042 --> 38:33.912
WITHOUT STABBING EACH OTHER
IN THE BACK.

38:33.945 --> 38:35.881
WE WATCHED OUT FOR EACH OTHER.

38:35.914 --> 38:37.849
WE HAD A DEAL!

38:37.883 --> 38:40.986
- UNTIL SHE DECIDED TO QUIT.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.755
- PAGE USED ME
TO MAKE UNIT CHIEF.

38:43.789 --> 38:47.459
MY CONTACTS, MY SNITCHES
MADE HER CAREER.

38:47.493 --> 38:50.529
AND WHAT DO I GET FOR IT?
- WHAT DID YOU WANT?

38:50.562 --> 38:52.964
- I WAS SUPPOSED
TO MAKE CAPTAIN!

38:52.998 --> 38:55.000
SHE GETS SICK
AND WANTS TO BAIL

38:55.033 --> 38:57.436
FOR A MAN!

38:57.469 --> 38:59.938
- YOU WERE JEALOUS.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.107
- [tired chuckles]

39:02.140 --> 39:04.042
SHE OWED ME.

39:04.075 --> 39:06.745
SHE DOESN'T WALK
UNTIL HER DEBT'S PAID.

39:06.778 --> 39:09.615
SO WHAT?
I TOOK THE MONEY.

39:09.648 --> 39:12.518
I EARNED IT.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.020
- I WANNA
ASK YOU SOMETHING.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.155
WAS IT WORTH IT?

39:17.188 --> 39:20.859
- TALK TO ME IN TEN YEARS
WHEN YOU HAVE NOTHING--

39:20.892 --> 39:25.063
NO FAMILY, NO FUTURE,
AND A DEAD CAREER.

39:28.099 --> 39:32.604
HOW'S THAT SOUND?

39:32.638 --> 39:35.507
- I'M NOT YOU, SUNNY.

39:35.541 --> 39:36.908
I'M NOTHING LIKE YOU.

39:36.942 --> 39:38.644
- [chuckles]

39:38.677 --> 39:41.580
THEN WHY ARE YOU
SO SCARED?

39:41.613 --> 39:45.150
- YOU HAVE RIGHTS,
DETECTIVE QADRI.

39:45.183 --> 39:46.918
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT

39:46.952 --> 39:48.854
ANYTHING YOU SAY CAN
AND WILL BE USED AGAINST YOU

39:48.887 --> 39:49.955
IN A COURT OF LAW

39:49.988 --> 39:51.990
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
