11:00.427 --> 11:02.029
They are looking
for things to do.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.231
And the problem with this
is always that we're living

11:04.264 --> 11:06.700
in a small country,
and we have nowhere to go

11:06.734 --> 11:08.535
and where to experience
these things.

11:08.568 --> 11:10.904
If you're in New York and you
don't like the city life,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.498
you say, "Shit, I'm..."
You say, "I'm not gonna..."

11:12.505 --> 11:13.807
You can say "shit" on the show.

11:13.841 --> 11:15.308
I'm gonna say this.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.602
I think we have two more
on this hour.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.145
That was one.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.539
"I'm going to get
out of the city."

11:19.546 --> 11:21.148
So you go to Minnesota,
you go to Texas.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.682
- Right.
- You take time to think about.

11:22.716 --> 11:24.610
And even in Malaysia, when you
are in Kuala Lumpur,

11:24.617 --> 11:26.847
and you go to, like... you go to
Terengganu, you go to Kuantan.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.889
We have nowhere to go.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.927
Not only is Singapore
a small city-state

11:33.961 --> 11:37.064
a little more than half
the size of LA,

11:37.097 --> 11:39.199
but there's also a pressure
of a kind

11:39.232 --> 11:41.902
from a Big Brother government
who's always watching,

11:41.935 --> 11:44.637
however benevolently
one might think.

11:48.876 --> 11:50.543
Every day as an entertainer,

11:50.577 --> 11:53.280
as a producer and director,
we are reminded what not to do.

11:53.313 --> 11:55.949
Don't insult other races.
Don't insult other religion.

11:55.983 --> 11:58.752
There are some parameters that
we always need to stick by.

11:58.786 --> 12:00.353
- Right.
- I think, as a creative person,

12:00.387 --> 12:01.714
I think we are always
trying to work out.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.957
And I think that's
challenging for us,

12:03.991 --> 12:06.293
and again, most of the things
that I do on television

12:06.326 --> 12:07.387
is funded by the government.

12:07.394 --> 12:08.796
So, you know, so what...

12:08.829 --> 12:10.630
You're biting the hand
that feeds you.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.401
But our job is basically,
as entertainer,

12:14.434 --> 12:16.403
just to purely entertain.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.372
And we know there a line
that we can't cross.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.609
Religion, our ancestors,
our parents.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.544
You know, things like that.
So it's...

12:24.577 --> 12:25.806
You can't make fun
of your parents?!

12:25.813 --> 12:27.247
In comedy?

12:27.280 --> 12:28.982
Uh, if your own parent,
it's okay.

12:29.016 --> 12:30.650
How about your, I mean,
family member...

12:30.683 --> 12:33.386
Yeah, but I get high marks
when they... you know,

12:33.420 --> 12:35.755
they can give you a twist
to a story of a mother-in-law.

12:35.789 --> 12:37.891
Right. Oh, mother-in-law's
okay.

12:37.925 --> 12:39.426
Yeah, mother-in-law's okay.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.187
Why does a mother-in-law
always get the joke?

12:41.194 --> 12:42.595
I don't know.

12:53.974 --> 12:54.474
♪

13:16.796 --> 13:19.867

Singapore works in so many ways:

13:19.900 --> 13:22.135
security, your family,
education.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.937
- Housing?
- Housing.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.539
So in a way, you're kind of
numbed into thinking that

13:26.573 --> 13:27.875
you know, everything's
wonderful.

13:27.908 --> 13:28.408
♪

13:32.245 --> 13:34.281
And then you start to wonder
after a while,

13:34.314 --> 13:36.016
"Is there another way of life?"

13:36.049 --> 13:37.743
You know, I think that's the big
kind of Singapore dilemma,

13:37.750 --> 13:39.619
in a way.
So is there angst?

13:39.652 --> 13:41.354
- Yeah.
- Is there angst?

13:41.388 --> 13:43.123
- It's angst.
- But I think there's no...

13:43.156 --> 13:44.557
There's no outlet for it.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.726
So everybody's, you know,
like going online,

13:46.759 --> 13:49.062
and everybody likes to be
anonymous about it.

13:49.096 --> 13:52.032
Even online, they have
paid the price for it.

13:52.065 --> 13:54.902
People have been let go
of their jobs,

13:54.935 --> 13:58.571
and that... that's the price
that we have to pay.

13:58.605 --> 14:02.142
The price may seem pretty high
by American standards:

14:02.175 --> 14:05.178
no political dissent,
no right to assembly,

14:05.212 --> 14:06.413
a restricted press,

14:06.446 --> 14:08.748
and limited freedom of speech.

14:08.781 --> 14:13.253
Sadir Varaket, Melanie Chan,
and Tanya Andoor...

14:13.286 --> 14:17.090
All Singaporeans, all navigating
the rules and regs,

14:17.124 --> 14:18.892
both spoken and unspoken,

14:18.926 --> 14:23.230
that go along with prosperity,
security, safety.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.098
Lor 29 in Geylang.

14:25.132 --> 14:28.201

and fried prawns

14:28.235 --> 14:29.436
with chili paste.

14:29.469 --> 14:30.603
Bak chor mee:

14:30.637 --> 14:33.340
fish ball noodle soup

14:33.373 --> 14:34.774
and beef satay.

14:34.807 --> 14:36.944
I think one of the issues
is that

14:36.977 --> 14:39.512
we're kind of a victim of our
own success in many ways.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.715
We've grown so fast,
and I guess expectations

14:42.749 --> 14:45.718
among the liberals
and progressives

14:45.752 --> 14:49.389
have just so far ahead,
including myself,

14:49.422 --> 14:50.958
that sometimes, you know, we...

14:50.991 --> 14:54.194
We need a reality check
about what society...

14:54.227 --> 14:56.296
What pace society can move at.

14:56.329 --> 14:58.131
So I think that's
a tension, is that

14:58.165 --> 15:00.367
economic growth has
happened so quickly.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.469
- Yeah.
- And sometimes social mores,

15:02.502 --> 15:04.972
social customs, might take
a bit more time.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.475
You know, a place where
everything works this well...

15:09.776 --> 15:12.479
And a system so seemingly
different than...

15:12.512 --> 15:15.915
Than we are taught to venerate.

15:15.949 --> 15:19.619
Uh, that's genuinely confusing.

15:19.652 --> 15:21.754
So what's the best thing
about Singapore,

15:21.788 --> 15:23.856
and what's the worst thing
about Singapore?

15:24.992 --> 15:28.962
I think best things
are tolerance

15:28.996 --> 15:30.730
and efficiency.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.333
But you know, if you just
look around us right now, right,

15:33.366 --> 15:34.734
you know, there's like...

15:34.767 --> 15:36.336
There's like a mosque
over there.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.005
There's a Buddhist temple
over there.

15:38.038 --> 15:40.907
There're like a bunch
of brothels over there.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.076
Prostitutes walking the street,
legally.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.744
They're regulated
by the government.

15:44.777 --> 15:47.847
And everybody has
kind of accepted this...

15:47.880 --> 15:50.317
This quid-pro-quo situation.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.851
Um, and it somehow works.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.786
Okay, you were shaking
your head, though,

15:53.820 --> 15:55.522
on something he was saying.

15:55.555 --> 15:59.859
No, I... I agree, but to be
feeling so secure

15:59.892 --> 16:01.528
and the security of it all,

16:01.561 --> 16:02.962
I think that's priceless,
you know?

16:02.996 --> 16:04.864
It's like, I'll do
what I have to do

16:04.897 --> 16:07.034
to be able to afford
to live well here.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.701
I'll work hard, I'll tolerate,

16:08.735 --> 16:10.337
and, you know, and even then,

16:10.370 --> 16:11.871
it's not that bad.

16:11.904 --> 16:16.143
When it comes to me
voicing certain things

16:16.176 --> 16:18.878
which maybe the government
doesn't agree with,

16:18.911 --> 16:23.183
I feel I have outlets that
don't have to be public.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.351
Right?
Okay.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.553
And I'm okay with that.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.388
You... you talk about
feeling safe.

16:28.421 --> 16:30.290
Yeah, security.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.559
Uh, do you feel respected?

16:32.592 --> 16:34.227
Definitely.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.729
I do.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.565
Do you feel that there's
parity for women

16:38.598 --> 16:40.900
and you are paid and treated
as well as men?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.835
- Yes.
- Yes, I think so.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.404
- Yes.
- You know why?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.706
I think that's because of maids.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.242
- What are maids?
- Maids, as in helpers.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.810
- Maids.
- Helpers.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.812
I think you'll find
I actually...

16:52.845 --> 16:55.715
If you look at Singapore, a lot
of women in the workforce.

16:55.748 --> 16:57.584
And the reason why that is so
is because

16:57.617 --> 16:59.086
everybody's got a maid

16:59.119 --> 17:00.920
looking after their
child at home.

17:00.953 --> 17:03.523
So maids are kind of like
the opiate of the masses.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.925
But an opiate gives you

17:05.958 --> 17:07.894
slothful and laying home...
Exactly!

17:07.926 --> 17:10.230
Exactly.
But if you have a maid,

17:10.262 --> 17:12.332
you're saying it frees you up
to join the workforce.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.367
It frees you up,
but it also means that I...

17:14.401 --> 17:17.604
My husband now, he doesn't know
how to serve himself water.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.272
- Yeah.
- He goes, he goes...

17:20.307 --> 17:22.108
"Eh, water."
Like that.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.411
- Laundry?
- Sorry?

17:24.444 --> 17:26.179
- You do laundry?
- No.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.946
- Laun-what?
- Really?

17:27.980 --> 17:29.282
No.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.118
Does anyone here know
how to do laundry?

17:31.151 --> 17:33.586
- We know how to do it.
- We kind of, in theory...

17:33.620 --> 17:35.388
We haven't done it.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.250
The guys do, 'cause we did
two years of military service.

17:37.257 --> 17:40.227
- Right.
- But the girls are pampered.

17:40.260 --> 17:41.694
Oh, mean!

17:41.728 --> 17:42.988
When's the last time
you did laundry?

17:42.995 --> 17:44.431
When's the last time you did...

17:44.464 --> 17:45.632
My maid was [indistinct].

17:45.665 --> 17:47.200
- Four days ago.
- Four days ago?

17:47.234 --> 17:49.436
Really? What, you sent it
to the butler?

17:49.469 --> 17:50.937
No, no.
I enjoy doing laundry.

17:50.970 --> 17:52.972

- I live by myself in New York.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.074
I live by myself in New York.
Yes?

17:55.108 --> 17:56.916
And I have to tell you,
maybe it's a sickness,

17:56.943 --> 17:58.645
maybe it's a weird thing,

17:58.678 --> 18:02.482
I enjoy throwing my clothes
into the washer

18:02.515 --> 18:04.317
and removing them to the dryer.

feel very satisfied with myself.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.958

about Singaporean food culture

32:05.992 --> 32:09.261

passionate about food.

32:09.295 --> 32:12.764

French or Italian meal

32:12.798 --> 32:16.768

a really good chicken rice.

country.
