00:01.359 --> 00:03.226
- Previously on Being Human.

00:03.270 --> 00:05.022
- Cecilia,
this is Aidan.

00:05.070 --> 00:06.890
- I'm a cop.
- You turned her?

00:06.939 --> 00:08.635
You don't know
anything about her.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.399
- When you turned me,
you made it sound like

00:10.440 --> 00:12.078
steak dinners
and chorus girls.

00:12.110 --> 00:13.578
All you had to do
was say yes and

00:13.610 --> 00:15.601
everything would be different.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.608
- I gave you everything.

00:17.650 --> 00:21.439
You never come
back here again.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.016
- It's been 80 years.

00:23.050 --> 00:24.142
- Henry?

00:24.190 --> 00:24.850
- You guys wanna be

00:24.890 --> 00:26.380
wolves all the time!

00:26.420 --> 00:30.630
- Josh, this is
Will, my ex.

00:30.660 --> 00:33.527
It happens almost
every night. I watch him.

00:33.560 --> 00:34.550
- Is anyone here?

00:34.600 --> 00:36.967
- She's clawing
at the surface.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.537
- Oh my god!
- I know that it's my wolf,

00:39.570 --> 00:40.196
- No! Aaah!

00:40.240 --> 00:42.504
- She just wants to run free.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.804
- I've never felt
anything so strong,

00:44.840 --> 00:46.774
But I can't control it.

00:48.740 --> 00:51.675
<i>** I was restless</i>

00:54.680 --> 00:57.240
<i>* I was young...</i>

00:57.290 --> 00:59.349
- (Sally): One of the worst
parts of dying

00:59.390 --> 01:01.688
was that split-second
when it hit me...

01:03.260 --> 01:06.195
"Mom and Dad aren't
gonna save me from this."

01:10.670 --> 01:14.334
I closed my eyes,
hoping that it was a bad dream,

01:14.370 --> 01:16.407
that Mom would wake me up.

01:18.810 --> 01:21.370
(* Man singing, indistinct )

01:21.410 --> 01:24.471
But instead
I woke up into this.

01:24.510 --> 01:27.411
* Into a light...

01:31.250 --> 01:33.355
(Grunting)

01:34.390 --> 01:38.327
- Aidan? Slummin' it
with us orphans?

01:38.360 --> 01:40.658
- I need you to get
a message out

01:40.700 --> 01:42.862
before you're
too drunk.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.299
- Yeah, I'm listening.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.298
- I'm looking
for Henry.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.091
(Chuckling)

01:47.140 --> 01:49.359
- Henry knows better
than to be here.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.366
(Groaning)

01:50.410 --> 01:51.366
- I know, I know.

01:51.410 --> 01:53.037
Just get
the word out.

01:53.080 --> 01:55.469
(Grunting)

01:57.150 --> 01:58.345
* Sit in chairs...

01:58.380 --> 02:00.314
And shut this damn thing
down by morning.

02:00.350 --> 02:02.148
- You don't realize
until it's too late

02:02.190 --> 02:06.582
what your parents did to
protect you from the truth.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.259
- Hi, it's me. Not here.
Leave a message after the beep.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.030
(Beep)

02:11.360 --> 02:12.794
- Hey, it's, um...

02:12.830 --> 02:16.869
Nora, it's me.
I got your message.

02:18.330 --> 02:22.870
I wish I could say
I understand why you left.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.332
But I know you don't
wanna talk right now,

02:24.370 --> 02:26.680
so I'm talking...

02:28.340 --> 02:30.877
to your voicemail.

02:30.910 --> 02:33.618
- Our parents read us
fairy tales

02:33.650 --> 02:35.379
thinking they'll never have

02:35.420 --> 02:37.787
to explain that
they aren't real...

02:37.820 --> 02:41.484
thinking they'll be dead
and gone before reality hits.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.349
But blood is forever.

02:45.390 --> 02:50.089
20, 30, 300 years
down the line...

02:50.130 --> 02:52.064
- Sally's mom.

02:52.100 --> 02:55.559
- ...we still need a hand
to reach for in the dark.

02:55.600 --> 02:57.329
* Here to stay *

03:07.980 --> 03:10.642
- When was the last time
you saw your mom?

03:10.690 --> 03:11.839
- My wake.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.282
- No, but I mean,
when was the last time

03:14.320 --> 03:16.049
you actually
talked to her?

03:17.090 --> 03:18.626
- Do you think
she's gonna die?

03:21.460 --> 03:24.100
- What's the right
answer here?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.794
(Knocking)

03:28.840 --> 03:32.731
Sorry, sir, I'm just gonna
take the sheets, if that's OK.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.739
- Mom?

03:43.050 --> 03:45.610
(Breathing unevenly)

03:45.650 --> 03:46.811
Is she--

03:47.820 --> 03:50.528
You need to get somebody
to change her clothes.

03:50.560 --> 03:54.098
She wouldn't want to be stuck
in a hospital gown for all...

03:54.130 --> 03:55.450
this.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.392
Hey, Dad.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.799
You have
to help him.

04:04.840 --> 04:07.775
He obviously hasn't eaten.
He's gonna get sick.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.574
You have to
get him something.

04:09.610 --> 04:11.169
- What?
- Get him some--some--

04:11.210 --> 04:12.245
I don't know,
some pudding.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.875
- Pudding? Sally, he'll
think I'm a crazy person.

04:15.920 --> 04:16.944
- Did you need something?

04:16.990 --> 04:18.981
- No, I...

04:20.190 --> 04:21.589
Do you need
something?

04:25.230 --> 04:28.097
- You can't ask him.
He's just gonna say no.

04:28.130 --> 04:29.393
Just get him
some pudding.

04:29.430 --> 04:30.864
Butterscotch.

04:32.270 --> 04:33.169
- Sorry, sir.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.294
- No, no!
Chocolate, chocolate!

04:35.340 --> 04:37.001
- OK, then.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.044
- Rena?

04:47.120 --> 04:51.045
- I thought we'd all be so much
older when this happened.

04:53.990 --> 04:55.810
- Sometimes it's just
a pudding day, huh?

04:55.860 --> 04:56.554
- (Chuckling): Yeah.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.354
Yeah, it is.

04:58.390 --> 04:59.892
- Josh Levinson, right?

04:59.930 --> 05:02.570
- Wow, two for two.
Do we know each other?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.694
<i>- Tm Del. Sherwood,
this is Del. Raimes.</i>

05:04.730 --> 05:06.027
Boston PD.

05:06.070 --> 05:07.333
- You have
a minute?

05:08.170 --> 05:10.468
- Yeah, I just
bought some pudding.

05:10.510 --> 05:13.480
It's--it's room temp,
so it should be fine.

05:13.510 --> 05:15.478
Hello.

05:15.510 --> 05:17.069
- Should we walk?

05:17.110 --> 05:20.114
- Yeah, uh, do we have a mission
statement for this walk?

05:20.150 --> 05:22.983
- Your name came up during
the course of an investigation

05:23.020 --> 05:24.181
and we're just here
to clear the slate.

05:24.220 --> 05:25.813
- What kind of
an investigation?

05:25.850 --> 05:29.525
- Do you remember where
you were on the 26th, Josh?

05:31.260 --> 05:33.592
(Banging, growling)

05:33.630 --> 05:35.928
- OK, I'm sorry.
I really need to know

05:35.960 --> 05:36.700
what's going on.

05:36.730 --> 05:38.027
- Were you with Nora that night?

05:38.070 --> 05:40.061
- What?
- Nora Sergeant.

05:40.100 --> 05:41.067
Your girlfriend.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.262
- A man named William Cart
was found dead

05:43.310 --> 05:45.563
and mutilated at
his worksite last week,

05:45.610 --> 05:47.578
and he's an ex of
your girlfriend's.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.135
- Josh right?, what are you--

05:51.050 --> 05:51.801
- See, I--I didn't...

05:51.850 --> 05:52.920
- Not have a
conversation with him

05:52.950 --> 05:55.044
at this hospital
the day he died?

05:56.050 --> 05:58.485
(Groaning)

05:58.520 --> 06:00.352
- I wouldn't call it
a conversation.

06:00.390 --> 06:02.654
- Right. You knew the history
between Will and Nora, right?

06:02.690 --> 06:04.658
- History? As in...
- Restraining order.

06:04.690 --> 06:07.159
Burns on her stomach.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.022
Don't even pretend you
didn't know about that.

06:13.700 --> 06:15.566
- Where's Nora, Josh?

06:16.570 --> 06:18.402
- I don't know.

06:21.480 --> 06:23.778
That is God's honest
truth. I don't know.

06:23.810 --> 06:24.777
- Right.

06:24.810 --> 06:28.110
Think about it,
then give us a call.

06:29.450 --> 06:32.249
- Pudding here
is the bomb.

06:38.460 --> 06:42.294
- Remember that lake we used
to drive up to in Maine?

06:42.330 --> 06:44.389
Mom hated the bugs

06:44.430 --> 06:47.695
and you lit all those
citronella candles

06:47.740 --> 06:49.037
and tried to
make it romantic,

06:50.240 --> 06:55.201
till Robbie knocked one over
and set fire to the campsite

06:55.240 --> 06:58.244
and that ranger
kicked us out.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.272
The car ride home
was the best part.

07:02.350 --> 07:05.081
We drove all night,

07:05.120 --> 07:07.214
Mom singing,

07:07.260 --> 07:10.150
you drumming
at the wheel.

07:10.190 --> 07:13.057
It felt like
home in that car.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.091
(Woman on PA, indistinct)

07:15.130 --> 07:17.428
You made her
happy, Dad.

07:18.430 --> 07:20.364
She had a good life.

07:21.400 --> 07:24.301
And that makes things
better on the other side,

07:24.340 --> 07:25.808
trust me.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.604
- Mr. Malik.

07:48.360 --> 07:49.725
- Mom?
- Sally?

07:50.800 --> 07:51.824
(Giggling)

07:51.870 --> 07:52.860
- Ah!

07:52.900 --> 07:55.096
- How is
this possible?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.131
- We're ghosts, Mom.

07:57.170 --> 07:58.308
- I've missed
you so much.

07:58.340 --> 08:00.604
Your rainy-day sweater.

08:00.640 --> 08:03.246
You always said
it made you feel safe.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.614
- Yeah, well, it didn't
exactly protect me.

08:06.650 --> 08:07.742
You look great, Mom.

08:07.780 --> 08:09.418
I told Josh that
you'd be happy

08:09.450 --> 08:11.316
that they changed
your clothes.

08:11.350 --> 08:13.182
- You told who?

08:13.220 --> 08:15.689
- Oh yeah, well,
it's a long story.

08:15.720 --> 08:18.849
- Well, we have
time now, right?

08:18.890 --> 08:21.791
Oh, I haven't moved in months!
You know, really moved.

08:21.830 --> 08:23.559
Can we-- can we
get out of here?

08:23.600 --> 08:26.194
- Whoa, wait! What about Dad?
- What?

08:26.230 --> 08:28.164
- We should go.
We should check on Dad,

08:28.200 --> 08:30.840
make sure he's OK, even
though he can't see us.

08:30.870 --> 08:33.669
- Uh, of course.
Of course.

08:33.710 --> 08:36.202
So you're saying I can't
change out of these pants?

08:36.240 --> 08:38.277
"Cause I really saw
myself in a dress.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.471
You know, that red one?

08:39.510 --> 08:41.318
- Just pace
yourself, Mom.

08:41.350 --> 08:42.840
Eternity.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.813
** This could be
the end of the line

08:44.850 --> 08:47.182
* In the blink of an eye

08:47.220 --> 08:48.585
(Grunting)

08:48.620 --> 08:51.487
* This could be
the end of the line *

09:01.540 --> 09:03.429
(Laughing)

09:19.020 --> 09:21.717
- You're not going
to stop now, are you,

09:24.890 --> 09:28.394
after you're starting
to be fun again?

09:28.430 --> 09:30.228
(Laughing)

09:34.240 --> 09:36.368
(Screaming)

09:44.310 --> 09:46.176
You are so
blood-drunk right now,

09:46.210 --> 09:49.111
you probably don't even
think I'm really here.

09:49.150 --> 09:50.220
(Exhaling sharply)

09:50.250 --> 09:52.344
Come on, Aidan.

09:52.390 --> 09:54.415
Remember Antietam?

09:54.460 --> 09:56.827
We fed like fiends.
Come on, you remember.

09:56.860 --> 09:59.352
You had visions
then too. Your wife?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.659
(Sighing)

10:04.700 --> 10:06.259
(Whimpering,
sniffling)

10:20.150 --> 10:21.515
- Brynne,
we have a guest.

10:21.550 --> 10:23.609
- Where's Nora?
Where is she?

10:23.650 --> 10:25.311
- Please be cool.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.819
- OK, yeah. Sure.

10:29.020 --> 10:32.354
The, um, the cops cornered me
at my place of work today.

10:32.390 --> 10:34.654
How 'bout you guys?
Did they get you?

10:35.830 --> 10:36.661
Oh, that's right!

10:36.700 --> 10:38.862
You don't work,
you skulk.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.959
Where is she?

10:41.000 --> 10:43.002
- I see you heard
about Will, then?

10:43.040 --> 10:44.439
You wanna pitch in
on some flowers?

10:44.470 --> 10:47.007
Because I'm thinking something
simple, yet elegant.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.304
- I know you had something
to do with this, damn it!

10:49.340 --> 10:53.117
- Of course, we did.
The 3 of us.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.515
- No, she wouldn't.

10:54.550 --> 10:56.712
- She wouldn't?
Do you even know the woman

10:56.750 --> 10:58.718
you're supposedly
in love with?

10:58.750 --> 11:00.058
He burned her!

11:00.090 --> 11:01.580
And that's just
the scar that stuck.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.520
Who knows what
else he did to her.

11:04.760 --> 11:07.821
He deserved to die.
- Like that?

11:07.860 --> 11:09.862
- What? The man who sent your
girlfriend to the hospital

11:09.900 --> 11:11.527
deserves to die
playing shuffleboard?

11:11.570 --> 11:13.231
- I--I just think--

11:13.270 --> 11:14.237
- That's just it!

11:14.270 --> 11:15.863
All right? You think!

11:15.900 --> 11:17.868
We act.
We're a pack.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.834
There was a threat, and look
at that, it's been resolved.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.109
- It's being investigated!

11:22.140 --> 11:23.039
- Trust me.

11:23.080 --> 11:25.708
The way he looked,
no human did that to him.

11:26.850 --> 11:28.045
We took care of her,

11:28.080 --> 11:29.013
in ways that...

11:29.050 --> 11:30.040
(Sighing)

11:30.090 --> 11:31.410
...you clearly can't.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.282
- This is insane.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.788
- Huh! OK.

11:35.890 --> 11:38.279
- Guys, I--I don't know
what you're saying to her,

11:39.900 --> 11:42.096
but she won't
return my phone calls.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.598
I just need to see her.

11:43.630 --> 11:45.098
- She needs to be
alone right now.

11:45.130 --> 11:46.120
- Really?

11:46.170 --> 11:48.264
She doesn't
need her pack?

11:48.300 --> 11:50.132
- I'm really sorry
you're acting this way.

11:51.270 --> 11:53.272
I only have to hope
that you'll come around.

11:53.310 --> 11:57.178
- Or what? You'll viciously
maul me in my sleep?

11:57.210 --> 11:59.508
- Come on, now.
We're all wolves here.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.410
We'll give you
a chance to run.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.512
- He's joking.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.124
(Car honking)

12:12.960 --> 12:14.450
- So, I see you're
drinking again.

12:14.500 --> 12:15.899
(Sighing)

12:15.930 --> 12:17.420
And boffing
the princess.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.098
- No, you know, you leave
her out of this.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.939
- Mr. Holier-Than-Thou
turned out to be

12:22.970 --> 12:26.133
the most ruthless one
of us all, didn't he?

12:26.170 --> 12:28.810
- You have no idea what
you're even talking about.

12:28.840 --> 12:30.205
- Really?

12:30.250 --> 12:33.276
I have a severed head
that says different.

12:33.320 --> 12:36.540
Aidan, you
killed me.

12:37.650 --> 12:39.379
You're probably
gonna kill Henry.

12:39.420 --> 12:40.910
You'll cut yourself

12:40.960 --> 12:43.884
a path straight to
the castle's front door.

12:43.930 --> 12:47.321
Whatever it takes to rule
side by side with Suren.

12:47.360 --> 12:50.466
- It's not who I am.
It's not what I want.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.229
- Yeah, I think it is.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.260
(Sniffling)

12:54.040 --> 12:55.439
Maybe you'll
kill her too.

12:57.270 --> 13:01.207
Let's, you and me,
make no mistake.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.744
You want it more
than I ever did.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.179
Hey, don't
get me wrong.

13:06.210 --> 13:08.178
I am not here
to criticize.

13:08.220 --> 13:11.315
I salute you, my son.

13:11.350 --> 13:14.320
You're a lot closer
than I ever was.

13:16.190 --> 13:18.329
OK, first order
of business.

13:19.430 --> 13:21.125
Kill Henry.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.367
- I can't. I--I--I don't
know where he is.

13:23.400 --> 13:24.367
I--I--

13:24.400 --> 13:25.424
- Aidan?

13:25.470 --> 13:27.996
You wanna knock back
a few pints of live

13:28.040 --> 13:30.964
to get your
strength up, I get it.

13:31.010 --> 13:32.262
But you're his maker.

13:32.310 --> 13:33.209
You know.

13:34.010 --> 13:36.672
So, shirt, cool
leather jacket.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.408
(Claps)

13:39.450 --> 13:41.373
Come on,
let's stake this bitch.

13:49.490 --> 13:51.151
(Whinnying)

13:51.190 --> 13:53.352
(People talking, indistinct)

13:55.000 --> 13:55.922
- The horse?

13:55.960 --> 13:56.927
- Yes.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.369
- It looked
just like that.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.492
- No kidding?
- Yes.

13:59.530 --> 14:00.759
(Chuckling)

14:01.570 --> 14:03.436
- Hey, doughboys!

14:03.470 --> 14:04.460
(Chuckling)

14:05.370 --> 14:06.508
- Bishop.

14:09.480 --> 14:13.417
- Look at you. Yes!
Yankee Doodle do or die.

14:13.450 --> 14:14.679
(Sighing)

14:14.720 --> 14:19.544
- James Bishop, might I present
Private Henry Durham, US Army,

14:19.590 --> 14:21.479
the finest medic
who ever lived?

14:21.520 --> 14:23.284
- Or died.
- Shhh!

14:23.330 --> 14:24.388
(Henry laughing)

14:24.430 --> 14:25.556
- And then
was born again.

14:25.590 --> 14:27.399
- Thanks to your
progeny here

14:27.430 --> 14:30.525
and of course,
to you.

14:30.570 --> 14:34.234
- Yes, uh, Aidan told me quite
a bit about you in his letters.

14:34.270 --> 14:35.590
- You wrote
about me, did you?

14:35.640 --> 14:38.109
- We never take
a turn lightly.

14:38.140 --> 14:40.404
- Yeah, you should
certainly make sure

14:40.440 --> 14:41.635
you're choosing wisely.

14:43.410 --> 14:45.276
- I'll just go say
goodbye to the fellas.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.178
(Car honking)

14:48.220 --> 14:50.314
(Talking, indistinct)

14:52.050 --> 14:53.518
- Well, at least
you hate him.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.211
- No. No, I like him.

14:56.260 --> 14:58.729
It's just, um, how
does that saying go?

14:58.760 --> 15:02.628
"We choose in our children what
we think we see in ourselves."

15:02.660 --> 15:04.264
And Henry has a touch of

15:04.300 --> 15:06.564
the rebellious in him,
wouldn't you say?

15:06.600 --> 15:08.659
- No, Bishop. He practically
bent over backwards

15:08.700 --> 15:09.895
to kiss your rings.

15:09.940 --> 15:13.205
He's a company man.
Trust me.

15:13.240 --> 15:14.674
- As were you.

15:15.810 --> 15:18.507
But I don't wanna ruin

15:18.550 --> 15:21.178
the discoveries of
fatherhood for you.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.040
Let's get a drink.
I know a place.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.952
(Car alarm blaring in distance)

15:29.990 --> 15:32.425
Well, this
brings us back.

15:32.460 --> 15:36.522
What exactly do you think
it is you're gonna find here?

15:36.560 --> 15:38.460
- He showed himself
the other night.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.140
He could've ran.

15:41.170 --> 15:44.708
We used to come here
back in the day to feed.

15:44.740 --> 15:46.230
They came in droves

15:46.270 --> 15:50.104
from the mountains,
the farms, the hollows,

15:50.150 --> 15:53.609
with nothing but the shirts
on their backs and hope.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.539
God, we had a time.

15:55.580 --> 15:58.345
- Look at you, Aidan,

15:58.390 --> 15:59.846
clinging to what?

15:59.890 --> 16:03.451
A memory, a moment in time,

16:03.490 --> 16:06.790
trying to find some beauty that
is the wreckage of your son.

16:06.830 --> 16:10.198
- You found it in me,
- Because you were worth it.

16:10.230 --> 16:11.265
- He's a good man.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.634
- Who stabbed you in the back
to sleep with Suren,

16:14.670 --> 16:18.038
drove her to ground, drove
all of us into the shadows.

16:18.070 --> 16:20.004
You have got to kill him.
- He was young.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.600
How many times did you
take a bullet for me?

16:22.640 --> 16:23.903
- It's not just anybody
he's organizing.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.078
That's my army.
- That's it, isn't it?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.669
- Organized, you got a problem.

16:27.720 --> 16:29.848
This is your freedom we're talking about man.
- Oh my--

16:29.880 --> 16:31.780
- What if the only thing

16:31.820 --> 16:33.686
that stands between
you and it is Henry.

16:33.720 --> 16:34.915
- Now you want me to be free?

16:34.960 --> 16:38.055
You spent centuries chasing
me around with a butterfly net.

16:38.090 --> 16:40.354
- Let's get something
else to eat.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.196
(Scoffing)

16:41.230 --> 16:43.426
I know these things
are never easy.

16:43.470 --> 16:47.100
Drink up. It's best if these
things happen in a blur.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.865
Kids.
Am I right?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.762
(Rena giggling)

17:19.800 --> 17:22.166
- (Woman):
Thank you so much.

17:22.200 --> 17:23.906
(Man laughing)

17:23.940 --> 17:25.738
Uh-uh.

17:27.780 --> 17:29.737
(Rena and man giggling)

17:29.780 --> 17:31.544
(Birds chirping)

17:32.710 --> 17:34.474
(Chuckling)

17:36.150 --> 17:37.242
- Mom?

17:37.290 --> 17:38.940
Mr. Patterson?

17:38.990 --> 17:39.912
- Sally?

17:40.760 --> 17:43.081
Wow, you're--
you're all grown up!

17:43.130 --> 17:45.451
- I'm dead, Mr. Patterson.

17:45.490 --> 17:47.322
- It's OK, Sally.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.692
- Mom, get out of him!

17:50.370 --> 17:53.192
It's your funeral.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.799
- Hey.

18:01.840 --> 18:03.001
- You've done some
work on the place.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.007
- Hey.

18:04.980 --> 18:07.449
- You OK?
- Never better.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.744
- (Bishop): Is that a cat
wearing a catcher's mask?

18:09.780 --> 18:12.090
That's cute.
- Where were you last night?

18:12.120 --> 18:13.610
- Aidan, you're cute.

18:14.790 --> 18:16.588
- Just waiting
on a friend.

18:16.620 --> 18:19.726
- You don't have
any friends.

18:19.760 --> 18:23.264
I mean, like--like fantasy
football or poker buddies.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.825
You don't have, like,
guys like that.

18:24.870 --> 18:26.122
So what friend?

18:26.170 --> 18:28.264
Is it Princess Suren?
- It was an old friend.

18:28.300 --> 18:31.008
- Oh my god! Is your wife
always this much of a nag?

18:31.040 --> 18:33.270
- I'm old, Josh.

18:34.540 --> 18:35.871
- OK.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.644
Well, now that
you're here, listen.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.647
That cop you turned--

18:39.680 --> 18:40.670
- I didn't turn--

18:40.720 --> 18:41.778
- Turning cops now?

18:41.820 --> 18:43.185
- No, I didn't
turn her.

18:43.220 --> 18:47.043
- OK, well,
I need her.

18:47.090 --> 18:49.809
- And what business do
you have with the police?

18:49.860 --> 18:51.680
- Can we be real just
for, like, a minute

18:51.730 --> 18:55.689
and not pretend she's
just the police, Aidan?

18:55.730 --> 18:57.323
(Sighing)

18:57.370 --> 18:58.826
The cops are after Nora,

18:58.870 --> 19:01.134
and I need your
vampire cop, Cecilia,

19:01.170 --> 19:05.209
to help make all this go away
in the way that you do.

19:05.240 --> 19:06.332
- Really?

19:06.370 --> 19:08.634
- You know I don't like
asking you for this, but...

19:09.840 --> 19:12.002
Nora killed her
ex-boyfriend.

19:12.050 --> 19:13.142
- Oh my god!

19:13.180 --> 19:15.911
- Not her, but her wolf.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.647
And still, not really her.

19:18.690 --> 19:19.942
I mean, it was
the, uh, purebreds.

19:19.990 --> 19:20.889
- Josh, really--

19:20.920 --> 19:22.149
- Aidan, listen.

19:22.190 --> 19:24.420
I know you've done this
a thousand times.

19:24.460 --> 19:27.851
You can't make this one thing
go away just for me?

19:27.900 --> 19:29.994
- Oh, I can think
an easy way to make this...

19:30.030 --> 19:31.759
- Please.
- ...Jo away.

19:31.800 --> 19:32.460
(Giggling)

19:32.500 --> 19:33.899
- Yeah, absolutely.

19:33.940 --> 19:37.262
Let's do that. I will appeal to
the newly turned vampire cop.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.938
I'll say: "Cecilia, my friend
Josh-- Oh, maybe you know him!

19:39.970 --> 19:41.938
"He's the werewolf who wanted
to take down Bishop."

19:41.980 --> 19:44.779
- Yeah but we all know how
that turned out!

19:44.810 --> 19:45.641
- Well, his girlfriend, oops!

19:45.680 --> 19:47.842
She killed Hegeman,
so there's that.

19:47.880 --> 19:50.781
- OK, this is...
- She also kind of mauled her--

19:50.820 --> 19:54.552
- It wasn't just her, Aidan!
- That's right, the purebreds!

19:54.590 --> 19:56.809
We gotta tell everyone
about the purebreds!

19:56.860 --> 19:59.079
So, kind of brutally
murdered her ex-boyfriend.

19:59.130 --> 20:01.098
So if you could just sweep
all this under the rug,

20:01.130 --> 20:02.291
that would be great.

20:02.330 --> 20:03.593
- This is cute
what you're doing.

20:03.630 --> 20:05.428
- THAT'S BECAUSE
I'M CUTE!

20:08.700 --> 20:12.102
Look, I'm just--
All I'm saying, Josh,

20:12.140 --> 20:15.178
is that, uh, this
isn't who you are.

20:15.210 --> 20:17.178
- Well, thank you
for thinking that.

20:17.210 --> 20:18.974
But sadly, I think
it's exactly who I am.

20:20.050 --> 20:21.779
I'm the guy with
an antique rifle

20:21.820 --> 20:25.040
loaded with silver, werewolf-
killing bullets under my bed.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.559
- You have Hegeman's rifle?
- Yeah.

20:27.590 --> 20:28.489
- Oh!

20:29.420 --> 20:31.627
- And they will find
all of this and more

20:31.660 --> 20:33.025
when they come after me

20:33.060 --> 20:35.529
with their questions
and their evidence.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.619
Where was I on the
night of the 26th?

20:37.670 --> 20:40.196
Well, I was turning into
a werewolf in my storage unit.

20:40.230 --> 20:43.768
Here's the key and here's
a videotape of the whole thing!

20:46.940 --> 20:48.533
How else may
I be of service?

20:48.580 --> 20:52.073
- You really need
to kill this guy.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.975
Great. So I'll just
see you at work,

20:56.020 --> 20:58.842
barring my
imminent arrest.

20:58.890 --> 21:01.712
Oh! And oh yeah,
Sally's mom died.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.956
But Sally's great.
She's great.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.583
(Door slamming)

21:07.700 --> 21:08.895
- I don't understand.

21:08.930 --> 21:11.160
Mr. Patterson died
when I was 10.

21:11.200 --> 21:13.760
What, did you, like,
have a pact or something?

21:13.800 --> 21:14.699
(Chuckles)

21:14.740 --> 21:16.993
- We never dreamed
it would actually happen.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.566
- Mom, are you aware of
where you are right now?

21:19.610 --> 21:21.931
Your husband is mourning
you, 10 feet away.

21:21.980 --> 21:22.936
(Sighing)

21:22.980 --> 21:25.301
- Sally,
life is long.

21:25.350 --> 21:27.000
- Um, not really, Mom.

21:27.050 --> 21:30.680
- I know this is heavy, Sally,
I mean, your mom and me, death.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.280
- Yeah, Gerry, it's, like,
really far out there.

21:33.320 --> 21:35.049
You were
my neighbour.

21:35.090 --> 21:36.979
You helped my dad
build my tree house.

21:37.020 --> 21:39.079
When you and my mom
were making iced tea,

21:39.130 --> 21:41.292
I had no idea that
you were-- Ugh!

21:41.330 --> 21:44.766
If I could puke right now,
I would, I swear to God.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.792
- Take a deep breath, Sally.
We're beyond it.

21:47.840 --> 21:49.797
We beyond all of it,

21:49.840 --> 21:55.870
you know, our earthly ties,
the restrictions of the flesh.

21:55.910 --> 21:58.208
- Now I know why you sat in the
dark for a week when Gerry died.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.673
- So you understand,
right? It was real?

22:00.720 --> 22:03.815
- No, Mom. I actually don't
understand anything right now.

22:03.850 --> 22:05.147
- Honey, I just died.

22:05.190 --> 22:08.615
Can we take a moment before
we get into all of this?

22:08.660 --> 22:12.085
- Mom, I was more than willing
to take many moments with you.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.656
Do you have any idea
how much I missed you?

22:14.700 --> 22:16.657
And then the first
free second you have,

22:16.700 --> 22:19.192
you're grinding on some
gravestone with Gerry?

22:21.040 --> 22:22.360
- Tell you what.

22:22.400 --> 22:24.937
I would love
to see your place,

22:24.970 --> 22:28.338
you know, curl up,
have some girl time.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.907
- God! Mom, that was so
awkward when I was 13 too.

22:42.720 --> 22:44.358
OK.

22:46.390 --> 22:51.089
So? Should we go
check out the wake?

23:06.780 --> 23:08.077
- Cecilia, right?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.770
- Do I know you?

23:09.820 --> 23:11.185
- I think you do, yeah.

23:11.220 --> 23:13.188
- Can I help you?

23:13.220 --> 23:16.451
- You're investigating
a girl named Nora Sergeant.

23:16.490 --> 23:18.026
I'd like
you to stop.

23:18.060 --> 23:19.949
- I don't even know
what you're talking about.

23:19.990 --> 23:22.721
- Aidan didn't--
- Aidan?

23:24.200 --> 23:26.897
- Nora hasn't done
anything wrong.

23:26.930 --> 23:28.432
I know that,
Aidan knows that,

23:28.470 --> 23:30.666
and I'm sure he's getting
around to telling you that.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.906
- -You're not
doing him any favours

23:32.940 --> 23:35.830
asking me to pull
strings for a werewolf,

23:37.580 --> 23:38.775
- Wait!

23:42.220 --> 23:45.713
- I may be new,
but I'm not stupid.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.718
- But I--

23:47.760 --> 23:49.683
I know about--

23:51.230 --> 23:53.756
What if I can
get you 2 wolves?

23:53.800 --> 23:56.189
- My building
doesn't allow dogs.

23:56.230 --> 23:57.789
- Purebreds.

23:57.830 --> 23:59.992
You said yourself,
you're new.

24:00.030 --> 24:02.692
Wouldn't this be
some kind of prize?

24:03.970 --> 24:05.301
Especially if--

24:05.340 --> 24:09.231
If you knew they were the
wolves that killed Hegeman?

24:11.810 --> 24:13.471
You know who
he was, right?

24:16.420 --> 24:17.888
- Nora who?

24:17.920 --> 24:19.217
- Sergeant.

24:20.350 --> 24:23.012
- She's like you?

24:24.960 --> 24:26.485
That's funny.

24:26.530 --> 24:29.192
This case wasn't
even on my radar.

24:29.230 --> 24:32.723
But now I'll be sure to
give it my full attention.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.892
Thanks so much.

24:48.450 --> 24:50.942
- Oh, hey!
You came.

24:50.990 --> 24:52.549
- Huh? Oh yeah.
Oh my god!

24:52.590 --> 24:55.355
I have so many questions
to ask your mom about you.

24:55.390 --> 24:57.415
- What's up with you?

24:57.460 --> 24:58.985
- What's up with you?

24:59.030 --> 25:01.124
(Doorbell buzzing)

25:01.160 --> 25:03.322
- Why would a ghost
ring a doorbell?

25:03.360 --> 25:06.091
- To instil a sense
of occasion? I don't know.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.292
My mom's brand new.
She has no skills.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.160
Stop.

25:10.200 --> 25:12.407
Josh, you think
you could get it?

25:12.440 --> 25:14.101
- Sure, why don't
I get it?

25:14.140 --> 25:15.130
- Thank you.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.204
- Uh, oh!

25:16.240 --> 25:17.844
(Blowing air
through teeth)

25:17.880 --> 25:19.541
- Oh, and don't mention anything
about being a werewolf,

25:19.580 --> 25:22.311
- Right, 'cause I
usually lead with that.

25:22.350 --> 25:24.182
(Laughing)

25:25.290 --> 25:26.917
- What's up with him?

25:26.950 --> 25:29.954
- Look, um, Mom didn't come
over much when Danny was around.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.583
And it's been years
since we were able

25:31.630 --> 25:33.928
to sit down
and just be us.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.691
I want that.
I miss that.

25:36.730 --> 25:38.198
- OK.

25:38.230 --> 25:40.324
(Moaning)

25:40.370 --> 25:42.338
OK, that is, um...

25:42.370 --> 25:45.931
- Like someone threw up in a
coffee cup and microwaved it?

25:51.480 --> 25:53.039
- Come on in.

25:56.350 --> 25:58.216
- So, these are your friends?

25:58.250 --> 26:00.389
- Otherwise totally
normal friends

26:00.420 --> 26:02.115
that can see
dead people.

26:03.790 --> 26:05.428
- You're not a vampire?

26:05.460 --> 26:06.484
- Yes.

26:06.530 --> 26:10.319
- I'm gonna go check on
the, uh, on the lasagne.

26:11.670 --> 26:15.300
- Gerry is so knowledgeable
about the beyond.

26:15.340 --> 26:16.330
(Chuckling)

26:22.110 --> 26:25.341
- Why am I yet again cooking
dinner for people who don't eat?

26:25.380 --> 26:27.041
(Sighing)

26:29.250 --> 26:31.412
(Rattling, dog barking)

26:37.490 --> 26:40.187
- Stay there!
- Murderer!

26:40.230 --> 26:41.595
- Stay there!
- Turn around!

26:41.630 --> 26:43.257
You didn't think
we'd find it?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.665
- Find what?

26:44.700 --> 26:46.168
- Your stack of dead!

26:46.200 --> 26:47.861
- I don't have
a stack of dead!

26:47.900 --> 26:49.459
- Stop lying!

26:49.500 --> 26:50.262
(Clattering)

26:50.300 --> 26:53.338
- No, please, please, don't!
- Hey.

26:53.370 --> 26:54.804
Are you coming?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.643
Are you crying?

26:59.680 --> 27:01.114
- It was a hot oven...

27:04.020 --> 27:05.340
(Sighing)

27:05.390 --> 27:11.284
I'm gonna go ahead and dial back
the crazy a little bit

27:11.330 --> 27:15.324
and just serve myself if
that's cool with--with you guys.

27:16.700 --> 27:18.361
(Clearing throat)

27:18.400 --> 27:19.299
- The place looks great, honey.

27:19.330 --> 27:21.640
- We burned it.
That helped.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.863
- Well, Danny always
stifled your aesthetic.

27:25.910 --> 27:28.971
- Yeah. I mean, it rocks that
you're free of him, Sally.

27:29.010 --> 27:30.478
- Yeah, it's awesome.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.947
It's funny how things
were with Danny, huh?

27:36.480 --> 27:40.280
I wasn't happy,
but I stayed for years,

27:40.320 --> 27:42.311
lying to myself,
to my family.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.782
- Sally, you don't--
You don't wanna--

27:43.830 --> 27:48.392
- But I do. Was there something
about Dad that I'm missing?

27:48.430 --> 27:51.161
Was he verbally or
physically abusing you

27:51.200 --> 27:52.270
while he wasn't
rubbing your feet

27:52.300 --> 27:54.359
or leaving you poems
on the kitchen counter?

27:54.400 --> 27:55.435
- You're making that up.

27:55.470 --> 27:56.892
- I'm not!
- One poem!

27:56.940 --> 27:58.066
- If he have written you two

27:58.110 --> 28:00.670
would that have stopped you
from boffing the neighbour?

28:00.710 --> 28:02.075
- I don't expect you
to understand.

28:02.110 --> 28:03.999
- Oh good!

28:05.010 --> 28:06.978
- She's still young.
- I know.

28:07.010 --> 28:08.569
It hasn't occurred
to you that your parents

28:08.620 --> 28:11.248
could be individuals,
have a life of their own?

28:11.290 --> 28:13.440
- No, I get that, Mom.
I really do.

28:13.490 --> 28:15.413
Having your own life,
that's fine.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.259
Having an extramarital affair
that leaks into your death,

28:18.290 --> 28:19.826
that's not fine.

28:19.860 --> 28:23.421
I died and you didn't
even know how!

28:23.460 --> 28:26.259
For so long, I've been
waiting for you to hold me,

28:26.300 --> 28:27.768
for you to tell
me what to do.

28:27.800 --> 28:30.497
And you've just
been waiting for him.

28:30.540 --> 28:33.976
- Sally, I love you.

28:34.740 --> 28:36.708
I loved your
father, but...

28:37.750 --> 28:43.348
Yes! Yes, I have a vital
relationship with Gerry

28:43.380 --> 28:44.939
that I have had to mourn
in silence for over a decade

28:44.990 --> 28:49.314
and that is what I want to spend
the rest of my time exploring.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.316
- (Whispering): Wow.

28:52.160 --> 28:53.582
OK.

28:54.460 --> 28:57.555
I appreciate the
honesty, I guess.

28:57.600 --> 28:58.567
(Doorbell buzzing)

28:58.600 --> 29:00.364
- I'll get it.
- I got it.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.164
- Don't get it!
- I got it.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.237
- You better not
invite them in!

29:04.270 --> 29:06.034
Because of the vampires.
"Cause the vampires.

29:06.070 --> 29:07.105
'Cause if you
invite them in,

29:07.140 --> 29:08.972
then they might
p-p-potentially kill us all,

29:09.010 --> 29:11.775
or just me, 'cause I'm
the only one still--

29:11.810 --> 29:14.416
I'm gonna go!
I'm--I'm gonna let myself out.

29:14.450 --> 29:17.476
Uh, Gerry, Rena, it was...

29:23.490 --> 29:24.582
- I'd ask to come in,

29:24.630 --> 29:26.724
but the last time I tread
on your territory,

29:26.760 --> 29:29.024
things didn't go so well.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.594
Can we talk?

30:09.200 --> 30:10.964
- Josh?

30:11.010 --> 30:13.433
Mind if we have
a look at those?

30:16.410 --> 30:17.502
- I moved around a lot.

30:17.540 --> 30:18.974
Pacific Northwest mostly.

30:19.010 --> 30:20.341
Easy to
disappear there.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.575
And you?

30:21.620 --> 30:22.712
Eating's been
good, I see.

30:22.750 --> 30:24.718
- Why did you
come back, Henry?

30:24.750 --> 30:27.185
- I'd heard you
killed Bishop.

30:27.220 --> 30:29.655
I heard you were supposed
to be running Boston.

30:29.690 --> 30:31.328
I came to support you.

30:31.360 --> 30:34.330
- Oh, and instead, you've
fallen in with the orphans.

30:34.360 --> 30:36.226
- I haven't fallen
in with them.

30:36.260 --> 30:38.069
I taught them
a few things.

30:38.100 --> 30:39.625
Survival.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.399
- Blood dens in
plain sight.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.260
- A fighting chance.

30:43.300 --> 30:46.235
Bishop, you, left
them with nothing.

30:46.270 --> 30:48.204
No tools.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.730
I've been out there
for 80 years.

30:49.780 --> 30:52.272
I couldn't just sit
back and watch them die.

30:52.310 --> 30:54.677
I want back in
the family, Aidan.

30:54.720 --> 30:58.486
I didn't come back for her,
if that's what you're scared of.

31:00.050 --> 31:02.018
Aidan, I'm tired
of hiding.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.926
Can you,
with any honesty,

31:03.960 --> 31:07.555
tell me you're the same
vampire I left 80 years ago?

31:07.590 --> 31:11.823
Can you tell me Suren's the same
vampire who exposed us all?

31:11.870 --> 31:16.262
With any God-given grace,
time heals,

31:16.300 --> 31:18.234
time matures.

31:21.040 --> 31:24.044
I think it was you
who tried to teach me that.

31:24.080 --> 31:25.707
(Car honking in distance)

31:27.850 --> 31:30.569
- Funny. Most people who
rent places like this,

31:30.620 --> 31:33.783
they fill them with boxes,
bowling trophies.

31:33.820 --> 31:37.586
Not too many people have
video cameras and cages.

31:37.620 --> 31:42.296
So you can see how this
isn't looking good for you.

31:42.330 --> 31:44.765
- How did you guys
even know to look here?

31:44.800 --> 31:46.120
- We followed you, genius.

31:46.170 --> 31:49.060
We thought you'd lead us
to your girlfriend, but...

31:49.100 --> 31:51.410
How did these get here?

31:51.440 --> 31:53.659
- Yeah, I know...

31:53.710 --> 31:55.200
(Clearing throat)

31:55.240 --> 31:57.231
Those were here when
I rented the place.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.270
It's weird.

31:58.310 --> 31:59.948
- We can always ask
the rental manager,

31:59.980 --> 32:03.018
see if he's seen or
heard anything strange.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.109
- Looks like the ones
at the scene, right?

32:05.150 --> 32:09.610
- Cages, video cameras
claw marks on the walls.

32:09.660 --> 32:11.059
We're cuffing
this guy, right?

32:11.090 --> 32:13.787
- This young man
is a sick bastard,

32:15.100 --> 32:17.819
but he's not our guy.

32:19.900 --> 32:23.291
- No. No, he's
definitely not our guy.

32:24.340 --> 32:26.536
- Hold up, hold up,
hold up! W-W-What?

32:26.570 --> 32:31.303
- We're gonna forget his
dopy little face after this.

32:31.350 --> 32:34.376
I'll be holding on
to that tape.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.570
- Yes, ma'am.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.279
- This is where
you thank me.

32:42.320 --> 32:46.655
- Yes, well, I'm not exactly
sure of our arrangement yet.

32:46.690 --> 32:49.296
- Well, I thought you were
making the purebred thing up.

32:49.330 --> 32:50.456
- Well, you're new.

32:50.500 --> 32:52.389
- You really wanna
be a smart-ass now?

32:52.430 --> 32:55.730
- No. No, ma'am.

32:55.770 --> 32:58.159
- Bring them to me.

33:02.710 --> 33:05.600
- I can't be any
more involved.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.317
- Whatever set up
you've got here

33:09.350 --> 33:11.785
and the one next door
for your girlfriend,

33:11.820 --> 33:14.414
I'm guessing you're already
pretty damn involved.

33:14.460 --> 33:16.781
I want the
purebreds.

33:20.230 --> 33:21.823
(Car honking)

33:21.860 --> 33:24.500
- So, babe, I'm gonna go.

33:24.530 --> 33:25.600
It's OK.

33:25.630 --> 33:29.589
You two need to be alone
together without me.

33:30.740 --> 33:33.937
I'll see you back
at the place?

33:33.970 --> 33:36.439
- Please tell me the place
isn't the cemetery,

33:36.480 --> 33:38.403
"cause that's gross
and weird.

33:38.450 --> 33:41.420
- No, it's this tree
we used to go to--

33:41.450 --> 33:42.849
- OK!

33:42.880 --> 33:44.917
- OK.

33:51.960 --> 33:54.122
I wanted to
come here alone,

33:54.160 --> 33:57.425
you know, walk in
the door, hug you,

33:57.460 --> 34:00.623
talk about
the wallpaper.

34:03.070 --> 34:05.232
But we're dead.

34:05.270 --> 34:07.739
And the way
you died is--

34:08.739 --> 34:10.275
You'll never
understand this

34:10.310 --> 34:13.701
because you'll never
have a daughter.

34:14.750 --> 34:17.139
For that,
I am so sorry.

34:17.179 --> 34:21.788
But for me,
to see you here...

34:21.820 --> 34:24.755
my amazing daughter...

34:24.790 --> 34:27.589
still in this house

34:27.630 --> 34:29.553
where you were with him,

34:30.600 --> 34:35.389
I mean, living, dying,

34:35.440 --> 34:37.898
to see this is
my idea of hell.

34:39.670 --> 34:42.002
- So what? It's just--

34:42.040 --> 34:43.599
It's easier with Gerry?

34:43.639 --> 34:45.505
- I failed you even
when you were alive.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.938
How can I help you now?

34:47.980 --> 34:50.277
- Can't you try?

34:52.190 --> 34:54.487
- How much time
do we have?

34:54.520 --> 34:57.649
- No offense, Mom, but if
someone in your situation

34:57.690 --> 34:59.624
were to get her
door right now,

34:59.660 --> 35:02.595
I am done with
this dimension.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.437
(Siren)

35:12.340 --> 35:16.436
- I haven't taken an easy
breath for most of a century.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.401
How can I come back?

35:21.420 --> 35:25.015
- Henry,
I told you before.

35:25.050 --> 35:26.814
There is no
coming back.

35:26.850 --> 35:32.027
- You can't mean that.
Not aft--

35:32.060 --> 35:34.791
You killed
your maker.

35:34.830 --> 35:35.991
You flouted the
very principals

35:36.030 --> 35:37.327
you're now
standing on.

35:37.360 --> 35:41.069
- It was never about principals.
It was about love, you ant.

35:41.100 --> 35:43.364
- I have to ask
you something.

35:43.400 --> 35:45.300
I've heard things.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.809
You and Suren--

35:47.840 --> 35:49.831
- Henry, choose
your words carefully.

35:51.550 --> 35:55.248
- After all the warnings you
gave me to stay away from her,

35:55.280 --> 35:56.509
really?

35:56.550 --> 35:58.018
- Are you just going
to stand there

35:58.050 --> 36:01.259
and listen to him talk
about your woman that way?

36:01.290 --> 36:03.588
Your woman!

36:03.620 --> 36:05.520
Oh, Aidan,
grow a pair.

36:06.390 --> 36:08.597
- Then you're truly
in love with her.

36:09.930 --> 36:12.797
- I don't know.
I don't know. Maybe.

36:12.830 --> 36:14.332
- Then where does
that leave me?

36:14.370 --> 36:15.929
- Dead.

36:17.340 --> 36:19.206
You think he's going
to choose his wayward son

36:19.240 --> 36:21.675
over the royal you scorned?

36:21.710 --> 36:26.443
My blood, my name will be
on that throne of power.

36:26.480 --> 36:27.845
And I'll use your head
for a footstool.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.075
Take him, Aidan.
Do it.

36:29.120 --> 36:30.269
(Snapping fingers)

36:30.920 --> 36:32.183
- Aidan.
- Destroy him!

36:32.220 --> 36:34.609
- I said where
does that leave me?

36:34.660 --> 36:36.389
- That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.956
- Really?

36:37.990 --> 36:41.551
'Cause I think I know.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.965
(Roaring)

36:49.540 --> 36:50.837
Aidan!

36:50.870 --> 36:52.429
(Roaring)

36:54.440 --> 36:56.033
(Both grunting)

36:58.780 --> 37:00.043
(Both growling)

37:02.880 --> 37:04.382
(Aidan growling)

37:26.110 --> 37:28.477
(Both grunting)

37:35.480 --> 37:40.384
- I've wasted 80 years,
fearing this moment.

37:40.420 --> 37:42.479
Maybe it'll
be a relief.

37:43.520 --> 37:45.079
- Do it, Aidan. Do it.

37:45.130 --> 37:46.825
You're a killer, man.

37:46.860 --> 37:49.795
You always have been.
Embrace it.

37:49.830 --> 37:51.764
This is freedom.
This is power.

37:51.800 --> 37:53.495
- All these years,

37:53.530 --> 37:56.693
wondering if you
were dead or alive,

37:56.740 --> 37:59.334
wishing that
I'd killed you!

38:01.610 --> 38:03.669
And then missing you.

38:05.150 --> 38:07.573
I can't do
this anymore.

38:07.610 --> 38:09.442
(Sobbing)

38:12.420 --> 38:14.787
- What, then,
do you suggest?

38:14.820 --> 38:17.812
If it's the shadows again,
kill me now.

38:17.860 --> 38:21.899
- No, I'm gonna find a way
to make this right for you.

38:21.930 --> 38:24.661
- That's what you said
to our brethren too,

38:24.700 --> 38:25.667
the orphans.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.794
- They weren't mine to save.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.138
You are.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.163
- I hope you give me
reason to believe you.

38:34.210 --> 38:35.803
(Groaning)

38:38.580 --> 38:39.900
- I just couldn't do it.

38:39.950 --> 38:41.748
(Grunting)

38:47.850 --> 38:50.615
- Course you couldn't.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.099
- Where's your mom?

39:00.130 --> 39:02.667
- Comingling
in some tree.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.469
(Sighing)

39:09.510 --> 39:13.469
- Thank you for cooking the
most awkward meal of all time.

39:13.510 --> 39:16.946
- I pretty much have
the market cornered on that.

39:16.980 --> 39:22.282
- When I was a kid, I kind of
just thought my parents were--

39:22.320 --> 39:25.858
I don't know, waiting
around, doing nothing

39:25.890 --> 39:27.881
until I came back
in the room.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.921
- That's what
Aidan and I do.

39:29.960 --> 39:31.621
(Chuckling)

39:33.070 --> 39:34.959
- She had a life.

39:35.900 --> 39:39.200
And I'm sitting here
judging her for it.

39:39.240 --> 39:40.935
(Thunder rumbling)

39:41.810 --> 39:43.278
I'm never gonna
know what it's like

39:43.310 --> 39:48.077
to want to protect
my child and fail.

39:48.110 --> 39:50.716
- I don't think it has
to be your child.

39:51.920 --> 39:56.915
I think if you love
someone, anyone, that much,

39:56.960 --> 40:00.590
you can surprise yourself
about what you do.

40:00.630 --> 40:04.567
** When everything
has turned to black

40:04.600 --> 40:06.796
* You don't know where to go

40:06.830 --> 40:11.609
* You need something
to justify your soul...

40:16.740 --> 40:18.174
- Jeez! Come in, man.

40:18.210 --> 40:20.178
- I don't know how--

40:20.210 --> 40:24.147
I don't know
what you did to her

40:24.180 --> 40:26.842
to make her do that.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.779
But I don't care.

40:28.820 --> 40:29.912
I don't want her back.

40:29.960 --> 40:32.952
When you speak to her...

40:32.990 --> 40:34.185
(Thunder rumbling)

40:34.230 --> 40:37.757
...tell her that she doesn't
have to worry about the police.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.793
It's been taken care of.

40:40.830 --> 40:42.093
(Scoffing)

40:42.140 --> 40:44.165
You think you
can do that?

40:44.200 --> 40:46.862
- My brother, that is
mighty impressive.

40:46.910 --> 40:48.901
I didn't think
you had it in you.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.908
- I told you
he was loyal.

40:50.940 --> 40:52.248
- Yeah.

40:52.280 --> 40:55.045
Yeah, I guess I am.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.174
* All the people
selling truths

40:57.220 --> 41:00.042
* On every corner now

41:00.090 --> 41:04.084
* They wait until the fear
has knocked you down

41:06.290 --> 41:09.897
* All the rules
are changing now

41:09.930 --> 41:12.797
* You're living in sin

41:12.830 --> 41:15.936
* Everything around you
is caving in...

41:15.970 --> 41:17.995
(Woman on CB, indistinct)

41:20.110 --> 41:23.136
Their address
is in there too.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.747
Now I'm done.
Do you understand?

41:26.780 --> 41:28.100
- I understand.

41:28.150 --> 41:31.142
Whatever happened to
wolves running in packs?

41:32.620 --> 41:34.679
- I'm not one of them.

41:37.160 --> 41:42.155
* And you sing
la la la la

41:42.200 --> 41:45.226
* La la la la...

41:45.270 --> 41:49.138
- A father can never
kill the son.

41:49.170 --> 41:52.959
Why work so hard to create
something only to destroy it?

41:53.010 --> 41:54.978
- But you just--
You spent all night

41:55.010 --> 41:57.308
telling me that
I had to kill Henry.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.899
I had to kill him.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.975
- Would that you could.

42:02.380 --> 42:06.214
But the son always kills
the father, you'll see.

42:06.250 --> 42:10.812
I've never been so scared
for you as I am now, Aidan.

42:10.860 --> 42:13.989
This is the proudest
moment in your life,

42:14.030 --> 42:15.657
protecting your own.

42:15.700 --> 42:19.295
But it'll be a moment
that will haunt you forever.

42:21.030 --> 42:24.364
* Opposition all around

42:24.400 --> 42:27.631
* Feeding off your soul

42:27.670 --> 42:29.877
* Trying hard to swallow

42:29.910 --> 42:33.005
* Up your whole

42:33.050 --> 42:36.076
* And the pain is
all around you

42:36.120 --> 42:39.647
* Waiting for you
to sell your soul

42:39.690 --> 42:43.684
* To sing it
La la la la

42:43.720 --> 42:47.088
* La la la la

42:47.130 --> 42:50.998
* La la la la la

42:52.270 --> 42:56.389
* To sing it
Lalalala *
