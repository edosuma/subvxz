00:05.480 --> 00:08.880
Hey. L'Eggo my Eggo.

00:10.240 --> 00:14.480
Hey. L'Eggo my foot
in your ass.

00:17.320 --> 00:19.520
Oh. Good morning.

00:19.560 --> 00:22.240
Oh, here, honey. I brought you something
back from the hospital.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.640
A lollipop.

00:25.680 --> 00:28.200
Mom, I'm 17 years old.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.560
Which is why I also
brought you condoms.

00:36.200 --> 00:40.120
Well, see, we had a teenage mom
come in, and it's just...

00:40.200 --> 00:42.400
Well, you know,
I worry about you.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.320
That I'll get pregnant?
You're not a good nurse.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.880
Now, don't be a porky mouth.
Oh. Here. Sexual health pamphlets.

00:52.680 --> 00:54.760
I just want you to know
that intercourse...

00:54.840 --> 00:57.960
is a responsibility,
not just a right.

00:58.040 --> 01:01.320
Okay, well, this couldn't
be more uncomfortable.

01:01.400 --> 01:03.760
Oh, uh,
don't forget your condoms.

01:03.840 --> 01:05.760
I was wrong!

01:40.880 --> 01:44.160
Hey, man, Red's been
spot-checking my room again.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.120
I can't believe
he still doesn't trust me.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.040
You know,
that really hurts, man.

01:48.120 --> 01:51.400
I'm gonna need you
to hide my stash.

01:51.480 --> 01:55.840
Sure. I'll put it in my dresser
under my Hong Kong Phooey socks.

01:55.920 --> 01:59.320
He can protect anything,
because he's faster than the human eye!

02:01.440 --> 02:03.640
You guys, the funniest thing
just happened to Jackie.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.320
Michael, the most horrible thing
just happened to me.

02:08.160 --> 02:10.000
My father found out
we're back together.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.520
And if we don't break up,
he'll never give me any money ever again.

02:14.560 --> 02:18.200
Wait. If you break up
with Kelso, you'll be rich?

02:18.240 --> 02:20.160
Talk about your win-win.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.000
Hold on.
He didn't know we were dating?

02:24.040 --> 02:26.600
Here comes the best part.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.560
I mean the worst part.

02:29.640 --> 02:34.680
My dad thinks you're a bad influence on me,
so I kept our love a secret.

02:34.760 --> 02:37.400
And now, I have to decide
between you and money.

02:39.320 --> 02:42.560
Gosh. It's like
<i>Sophie's Choice</i> for morons.

02:43.600 --> 02:45.440
Hey, let's take a poll.

02:45.520 --> 02:48.720
Who thinks Sophie
should keep Kelso?

02:48.800 --> 02:51.840
- The money?
- Ooh!

02:51.920 --> 02:56.080
- You guys, this isn't a joke.
- But it's funny like a joke.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.600
How do I choose between something
that makes my whole life complete...

03:00.680 --> 03:03.200
and you?

03:06.240 --> 03:09.880
Well, I don't know, baby,
but I love you.

03:09.960 --> 03:12.600
Oh, Michael,
I love you too.

03:12.680 --> 03:15.520
Okay, I choose love.
I choose love!

03:15.600 --> 03:17.440
Aw!

03:17.480 --> 03:19.840
Yeah, aw!
Okay.

03:19.920 --> 03:22.320
Now get a job, because
I need a ton of money.

03:28.800 --> 03:32.520
Guys, I would like you to meet Point Place's
new foreign exchange student, Thomas.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.840
- Hey.
- What's up?

03:34.880 --> 03:38.440
Hello, pretty lady
with eyes like the sea.

03:40.440 --> 03:44.680
No. Which sea?

03:44.760 --> 03:48.000
Okay, easy there,
Casa-new-guy.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.920
I'm showing Thomas
the ropes.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.720
- Hello.
- What, are you crazy?

03:56.800 --> 03:59.200
That's Nicole Mayzell.
She's way out of our league.

04:00.920 --> 04:03.360
Oh. Then we must be
in different leagues...

04:03.440 --> 04:05.680
because I just had
sex with her last night.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.280
Oh-ho-ho!

04:08.320 --> 04:13.040
New foreign guy: <i>uno.</i>
Old foreign guy: Nada.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.000
This is outrageous!
The closest I have come to sex...

04:16.079 --> 04:19.920
was when the football team pinned me down
in the shower and made me kiss my own ass!

04:23.520 --> 04:25.880
Hey, um, if you think
that's close to sex...

04:25.960 --> 04:28.480
then you're gonna be delighted
with actual sex.

04:28.560 --> 04:32.600
Yeah, Thomas, you should stay away
from the football team for a while.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.040
We wouldn't want a cutie
like you to get hurt.

04:36.520 --> 04:38.400
Oh, the football team loves me.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.440
I'm their new placekicker!

04:40.480 --> 04:42.360
What?

04:42.400 --> 04:46.200
Oh, the room is spinning!
How did you do all this?

04:46.240 --> 04:48.280
I have delightful accent.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.200
So do I.

04:52.360 --> 04:56.880
Yes, but a nerd
with an accent is still a nerd.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.040
Now, good day, sir.

05:04.400 --> 05:09.520
<i>I</i> say "good day."
Now, good day.

05:09.600 --> 05:13.000
- Good day.
- Good day.

05:14.720 --> 05:16.960
- I said, good day!
- I said, good day!

05:23.400 --> 05:26.360
- He stole that from me.
- But, Fez...

05:26.440 --> 05:29.000
I said, from me!

05:39.720 --> 05:42.080
Oh, I'm out.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.480
Out?

05:44.560 --> 05:48.200
I am home one night this week,
and you're out?

05:48.280 --> 05:50.360
Hey, don't look at me.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.760
You had a whole bag of 'em,
and you wasted 'em on Eric!

05:54.840 --> 05:58.120
He's probably down there
making balloon animals.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.240
Well...

06:03.320 --> 06:05.520
I guess we'll just sleep.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.320
Well, couldn't we just, uh...

06:09.400 --> 06:11.600
You know, I mean, really,
what are the chances?

06:11.680 --> 06:16.040
We could have a change-of-life baby!

06:18.680 --> 06:20.600
Oh, crap.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.920
I'll be right back.

06:42.880 --> 06:46.040
It's late.
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

06:48.800 --> 06:50.640
Oh, my God.
My sock drawer.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.560
I'm dead! He found your stash!
Do you know what this means?

06:55.000 --> 06:58.080
Yeah. I get your room,
and you get sent to military school.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.240
Eric caught me stealing his...

07:08.320 --> 07:10.200
things.

07:19.840 --> 07:24.640
That's not funny.
I'm a grown man.

07:24.720 --> 07:28.120
I don't go rummaging around
in teenage boys' drawers...

07:28.200 --> 07:31.160
- looking for... things.
- Condoms.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.880
That word is forbidden!

07:35.120 --> 07:39.000
Okay. Good night.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.320
- Condoms.
- Quit it!

07:51.000 --> 07:54.320
I don't know.
I've just always been good-looking.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.360
Look at that foreign bastard...

08:03.120 --> 08:05.400
cracking up the whores.

08:06.640 --> 08:10.200
Checking the score.
Old foreign guy: Nada.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.800
New foreign guy: <i>dos.</i>

08:12.880 --> 08:16.880
Hey, if I pretend to say something funny,
will you laugh?

08:16.960 --> 08:19.000
No.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.960
That Thomas is shady.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.200
But have you noticed he never says
what country he's from?

08:32.039 --> 08:33.919
What country are you from?

08:34.000 --> 08:36.600
What country are you from?

08:36.679 --> 08:38.360
America.

08:38.440 --> 08:40.320
Fine.
Mystery solved.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.920
Psst. Mom.

08:50.000 --> 08:55.040
- Is Dad around?
- No, I think he's upstairs.

09:00.320 --> 09:03.320
Hot!
Hot, hot, hot, hot!

09:03.360 --> 09:06.240
Love you, Mom. Thanks for breakfast.
See ya tonight. Bye.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.920
Psst!
Kitty, Eric around?

09:15.280 --> 09:17.120
No. He just left.

09:17.200 --> 09:19.360
Perfect!

09:19.440 --> 09:23.080
Red, this is just silly.

09:23.160 --> 09:25.000
You can't avoid
Eric forever.

09:25.080 --> 09:27.240
- I know that.
- Well, good.

09:27.320 --> 09:30.600
I just have to avoid him
till he goes to college.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.520
What's that, like, a year?
I can do that.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.320
Hey.

09:43.360 --> 09:48.120
Michael, I'm broke.
I had to buy generic hair conditioner.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.680
And now, I have split ends.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.920
Oh, no one is gonna
notice that, baby.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.480
They'll all be looking
at that monster zit.

09:57.200 --> 10:00.960
I have to ration my cover-up.
So find a job already!

10:01.040 --> 10:04.600
I'm tryin', okay?
It's tough out there.

10:04.640 --> 10:08.800
I just had an interview at that new store
in the mall, the Cheese Palace.

10:08.880 --> 10:11.480
- Where curd is king?
- The very same.

10:11.520 --> 10:16.280
They're hiring a new cheese maiden,
you know, to hand out the samples.

10:16.320 --> 10:21.000
- But I didn't get the job 'cause they want a girl.
- But you're pretty like a girl.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.000
Thank you!

10:24.920 --> 10:29.240
Man, but the manager wants an actual girl...
you know, with boobs and stuff.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.760
Hey, you know who's an actual girl
with boobs and stuff?

10:31.840 --> 10:36.240
Oh, Donna, you don't have
to get a job just for me.

10:36.320 --> 10:39.680
I was talking about you,
pimple chin.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.760
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.960
I am not getting a job.

10:47.040 --> 10:49.920
A job is for poor people.

10:50.000 --> 10:53.400
I am a rich person
who doesn't have money.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.920
Big diff.

10:58.760 --> 11:00.640
Hey, is that a blackhead?

11:02.000 --> 11:04.040
No!

11:05.200 --> 11:08.920
Cheddar? Cheddar?

11:08.960 --> 11:10.880
Cheddar?

11:15.780 --> 11:19.580
Try the Swiss.
You can't miss.

11:19.620 --> 11:21.820
Try the cheddar!
It's even better!

11:23.780 --> 11:26.500
The floor's real shiny,
and I see your heinie.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.460
- Oh!
- Hey!

11:28.540 --> 11:30.900
The cheese maiden hit me!

11:30.980 --> 11:33.780
Cheese guards, seize her!

11:33.860 --> 11:36.260
My God, this job is awful!

11:36.340 --> 11:39.100
Are you sweating?

11:39.140 --> 11:41.940
I mean,
is work making you sweat?

11:42.020 --> 11:46.180
No. I'm glistening!
It's glisten!

11:46.260 --> 11:49.180
Whatever it is... Yech!

11:49.220 --> 11:51.140
Look, Michael...

11:51.220 --> 11:54.460
the only reason I have this job
is so that you and I can be together.

11:54.500 --> 11:57.780
All you've done for our love
is sit in a basement eating Fritos.

11:57.860 --> 12:00.700
Well, for your information...

12:00.780 --> 12:03.140
if I send in
80 empty Frito bags...

12:03.180 --> 12:05.660
I get a free
remote-control car...

12:07.140 --> 12:08.980
which I was gonna
give to you...

12:09.060 --> 12:11.100
after I played with it
only a little.

12:12.780 --> 12:14.740
Now, that is love!

12:19.420 --> 12:21.820
Thomas!

12:23.940 --> 12:25.820
Thomas!

12:27.660 --> 12:29.580
Thomas!

12:31.420 --> 12:35.180
What I have to do is show everyone
that I am cooler than Thomas.

12:35.260 --> 12:39.140
You know, I once saw the Fonzie
do something on TV...

12:39.220 --> 12:41.500
that just might do the trick.

12:45.020 --> 12:49.620
I am now going to jump over
a shark on water skis...

12:49.700 --> 12:53.220
to prove that I'm the coolest
foreign exchange student in Point Place.

12:53.300 --> 12:56.340
- He'll never make it.
- Shut up. He can do it.

12:56.420 --> 12:58.540
He's the Fez!

12:59.740 --> 13:02.340
Okay, here I go.
Hit it!

13:17.860 --> 13:20.140
- Oh!
- He's crazy, man!

13:20.220 --> 13:23.340
- He's crazy!
- He's at the ramp!

13:23.420 --> 13:26.700
Ay!

13:34.660 --> 13:38.620
- Yes!
- Yeah, man!

13:38.700 --> 13:40.580
You suck, Thomas!

13:43.940 --> 13:47.100
Fez, you jumped that shark,
and you're not even wet.

13:48.340 --> 13:50.900
That's 'cause
I'm cool-a-mundo.

13:50.980 --> 13:52.860
Ay!

13:55.460 --> 13:57.340
So, what do you think?

13:59.140 --> 14:02.540
Not only is that the worst idea
I've ever heard...

14:02.620 --> 14:05.460
it was the worst moment
in television history.

14:07.140 --> 14:09.700
Yeah, you're right.
I stopped watching after that episode.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.700
Thomas!

14:22.500 --> 14:25.500
This is freaky, man.
Red hasn't said anything about the stash...

14:25.540 --> 14:29.340
which can only mean he's gone
to the much-feared stage: Beyond yelling.

14:31.580 --> 14:34.300
He's gone Darth Vader, man.

14:34.340 --> 14:38.020
Or... instead of
Red snagging you...

14:38.100 --> 14:40.420
maybe you snagged Red...

14:40.500 --> 14:42.340
dipping into Hyde's stash!

14:42.420 --> 14:44.620
I'm just sayin',
everyone's tryin' it.

14:46.180 --> 14:49.980
I guess Kelso's right.
Everyone is trying it.

14:53.380 --> 14:56.260
I'm tellin' ya, this stuff
isn't just for cakes.

14:56.340 --> 14:59.180
It's great all by itself.

15:00.740 --> 15:03.500
Mmm!

15:03.580 --> 15:06.300
Wait, wait. Watch this.

15:14.380 --> 15:18.420
Look at me.
I'm Whipped-cream Head!

15:18.500 --> 15:22.700
Fear me!
All fear Whipped-cream Head!

15:26.340 --> 15:28.220
Mmm!

15:31.500 --> 15:33.660
Kelso, that was delightful.

15:33.700 --> 15:38.580
But the only part you left out
is where Red kills me!

15:40.180 --> 15:44.820
Forman, it was my stash.
I don't wanna leave you hangin'.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.500
But I'm gonna.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.700
So good luck
in military school.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.940
How exciting!
My first American road trip.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.500
I can't wait
to see Lake Dill-hole.

16:05.460 --> 16:08.140
Well, the wait is over.
We're here.

16:08.220 --> 16:11.020
Now, hop out,
you crazy son of a gun.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.460
This is the Michigan border.

16:17.980 --> 16:21.860
- Well, what do you know.
- So where is Lake Dill-hole?

16:21.940 --> 16:25.500
Oh, it's right there
behind the Get Bent Memorial.

16:26.860 --> 16:29.180
So get bent, dill-hole!

16:34.420 --> 16:37.700
What's the score now?
Oh, here we go.

16:37.780 --> 16:41.340
Fez: One. Thomas:
Stranded in Michigan!

16:42.900 --> 16:45.060
Oh, I kill me.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.220
Nice job.

16:47.300 --> 16:49.340
Thanks.
I learned from the best.

16:49.420 --> 16:51.300
Thanks.

16:51.340 --> 16:53.540
I would've taken his clothes.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.700
That's why you're the king.

16:57.340 --> 17:00.100
The Gouda's so good-a.

17:00.180 --> 17:02.300
The Havarti's a party!

17:02.380 --> 17:05.020
Hello, milady.

17:05.099 --> 17:09.380
- "Fondue" you love me?
- Stop doing that!

17:09.460 --> 17:12.220
All day with this.
"Hey, 'fondue' me."

17:12.260 --> 17:15.579
"Ooh, I stepped
in 'fon-dog-due.'"

17:15.660 --> 17:17.819
Oh, my God.
This is awful.

17:17.859 --> 17:21.700
Michael, a few minutes ago,
I smelled stinky cheese...

17:21.780 --> 17:23.859
and it was me!

17:26.020 --> 17:28.540
Look, I'm sorry.
I love you, but I can't do this.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.740
You mean,
you can't "fondue" it.

17:31.780 --> 17:35.340
God, will you shut up!
Look, I am not cut out for work.

17:35.420 --> 17:38.260
I'm cut out for having
rich people give me things.

17:38.340 --> 17:42.380
But you got a job for me.
I mean, doesn't that make you satisfied?

17:46.500 --> 17:48.380
Oh, my gosh!

17:48.420 --> 17:51.020
It's a check!

17:51.100 --> 17:53.940
And that's my name!

17:54.020 --> 17:55.860
Mine!

17:55.940 --> 17:57.660
So we can stay together!

17:57.740 --> 18:00.220
- Yeah, and I can still be rich!
- Yeah!

18:00.300 --> 18:02.620
Well, if this isn't gonna go badly,
I'm heading home.

18:02.660 --> 18:05.100
No, wait.
Jackie deserves a celebration.

18:05.180 --> 18:07.820
Hey, let's go buy me
that remote-control car!

18:11.100 --> 18:15.860
No, Michael.
Money doesn't grow on trees.

18:15.940 --> 18:18.860
Money <i>doesn't</i> grow on trees!

18:21.380 --> 18:24.100
You know, I think
having a job is changing me.

18:24.180 --> 18:26.500
Okay, think about it.
A whole new me.

18:26.580 --> 18:29.780
That'd be great.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.580
- I gotta... - I'm gonna...
- Okay, enough!

18:36.660 --> 18:38.780
You, sit.

18:40.180 --> 18:44.220
You can't make me join the army, okay?
I'll cut off a toe!

18:44.300 --> 18:47.740
- What?
- Okay, okay.

18:47.820 --> 18:51.140
We are just gonna
clear the air.

18:51.180 --> 18:53.100
Right now.

18:55.620 --> 18:59.260
Now, Eric, the other night...

18:59.340 --> 19:01.500
your father and I
were getting intimate...

19:08.900 --> 19:12.460
And we realized
we didn't have any protection.

19:12.540 --> 19:14.900
For hugging.
We just...

19:14.980 --> 19:17.180
We hug.

19:21.060 --> 19:25.100
So your dad went to your room looking
for one of those condoms I gave you...

19:25.180 --> 19:30.020
and you caught him, and he has just been
so embarrassed ever since.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.260
Condoms?

19:34.340 --> 19:38.260
Oh! Condoms.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.100
Yeah, condoms.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.020
What did you think it was?

19:51.300 --> 19:53.420
What did <i>you</i> think it was?

19:55.820 --> 19:58.500
What did you do?

19:58.580 --> 20:01.180
What did <i>you</i> do?

20:04.260 --> 20:06.820
I-I didn't do anything.
Okay?

20:06.900 --> 20:09.300
You stole condoms!
Get him, Mom.

20:10.340 --> 20:12.620
- You're grounded.
- For a week.

20:12.700 --> 20:15.220
Hyde too.

20:15.300 --> 20:20.540
Whatever was in that drawer that you
didn't want me to see, I'm sure it was his.

20:22.140 --> 20:24.860
Fine. No complaints here.
Thank you.

20:30.300 --> 20:34.300
You suppose there was actually something
in that drawer he didn't want us to see?

20:36.100 --> 20:38.020
Who cares?

20:40.200 --> 20:43.400
I know in orientation we talked
about theft in the workplace...

20:43.480 --> 20:46.800
so I would like to report
a theft from my check.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.000
Now, I don't know who FICA is...

20:49.080 --> 20:52.320
but that bitch stole,
like, 10% of my money.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.720
Also, now, I don't know if you have
this key in your typewriter...

20:55.800 --> 20:59.280
but when I write "Jackie,"
I like to dot my "I" with a smiley face.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.800
Also, now, I put this
in the suggestion box, but...

21:02.880 --> 21:05.840
You have something
hanging from your nose.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.920
Oh, and I want Saturday off.
Thank you. Bye.
