NOT LET THE RULE OF LAW

STAND IN HIS WAY.

04:11.440 --> 04:13.740
FIRST, HE KIDNAPPED
THE HIGH COUNCIL.

THEN, FEELING I WOULD
LEAD A REVOLT AGAINST HIM,

04:17.470 --> 04:18.710

UNTIL I WAS UNDER HIS CONTROL.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.160
AS I WAS MAKING MY GETAWAY,

04:36.230 --> 04:38.060
HE WAS ACCIDENTALLY CAUGHT

SOMEHOW,

HE SENT A METEOR HURTLING
AT ACMETROPOLIS.

WHO ELSE MIGHT SUFFER.
