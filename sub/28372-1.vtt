01:36.138 --> 01:37.514

01:37.597 --> 01:40.017
<i>He does not know
the definition of "quit."</i>

01:40.100 --> 01:42.894
<i>But if he keeps this up,
he's gonna learn the words "knockout,"</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:45.731
<i>and possibly "concussion" real soon. Oh!</i>

01:45.814 --> 01:48.734
Listen, you cannot box with this guy!
What are you doing?

01:48.817 --> 01:50.611
[sportscaster] <i>Lifted off the mat!
Could've been six inches!</i>

01:50.694 --> 01:52.529
- <i>No way to know!</i>
- Oh, my God, dude.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.239
Oh, my God, oh, my God, what is this?

01:54.323 --> 01:55.532
Get out. Get out!

01:55.616 --> 01:57.242
- You can't!
- [phone vibrating]

01:58.160 --> 01:59.494
Get out!

01:59.578 --> 02:00.579
[sportscaster] <i>What's gonna happen?</i>

02:04.666 --> 02:06.001
Hey, what's goin' on, sir?

02:08.086 --> 02:09.045
Yeah, how you doin'?

02:11.173 --> 02:12.716
OK. Not a problem.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.053
What time do you need to see everybody?

02:16.136 --> 02:18.221
[paper rustling]

02:18.305 --> 02:20.223
1300 tomorrow at the team room?

02:21.433 --> 02:23.018
Not a problem, sir.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.062
I will get everybody together and...

02:27.356 --> 02:28.940
No, I-I haven't talked to Mike.

02:29.608 --> 02:33.403
Probably about, um, eight months or so,
since he was dismissed.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.451
Well, I mean, sir, I can just grab Bailey
or Robinson.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.620
Both those guys are just back out,
and they had...

02:43.747 --> 02:45.832
Uh, sir, actually, as far as I know,

02:45.916 --> 02:47.876
I don't even think Mike has his quals...

02:51.004 --> 02:52.714
Sir, with all due respect,
I think that that will...

02:55.300 --> 02:58.178
Yes, sir... Yes, sir, I understand.

02:58.261 --> 03:01.723
I will have everybody there,
Mike included, at 1300 tomorrow.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.684
- [pen clicks]
- Roger that.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.562
All right.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.575
[goat bleats]

03:40.303 --> 03:43.056
[man] I need you to communicate
with your prime minister.

03:43.140 --> 03:46.768
Explain to him that now...
I am in control.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.022
Prime Minister will not negotiate
with you.

03:52.232 --> 03:55.736
- But if you let my family go...
- [woman crying]

03:55.819 --> 03:57.404
...you can do whatever you want with me.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.670
Shh. It's OK, my sweet.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.589
I am no fool.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.048
You are too important to the government.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.307

[soldier] Good eye.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.438
Freeze, Movladi!

05:13.522 --> 05:15.232
I will kill this man, I swear it!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.484
Sick bastard, I oughta pop you right now.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.404
- No!

05:21.947 --> 05:23.907
- [gunshots]

05:23.990 --> 05:24.991
[Marco] Movladi!

05:26.409 --> 05:27.369
Marco!

05:29.663 --> 05:31.331
His little brother Marco, how about that?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.708
I will kill this man.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.918
I will kill him!

05:35.001 --> 05:37.045
How about I pop him instead of you?
What do you think of that?

05:37.128 --> 05:39.965
- I think we should let him go.
- What?

05:40.799 --> 05:42.342
Movladi.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.802
You know how this is gonna end.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.929
Let's do something else, OK?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.722
There's an exit right behind you.

05:47.806 --> 05:49.558
You give us back the hostages,

05:49.641 --> 05:50.767
we give you back your brother,

05:50.850 --> 05:52.686
you walk out of here, no one dies.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.396
- Deal?
- It's a bullshit deal.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.481
Our mission was to come in here
and rescue the hostages.

05:56.565 --> 05:57.607
We can kill these guys any day.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.401
Let him go off
and kill more innocent people?

05:59.484 --> 06:01.361
The only way you deal with this
is by force.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.279
It's the only thing they understand.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.948
- Stop thinking with your...
- Stand down, that's an order!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.284
Let 'em go, or your little brother dies.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.618
[woman whimpering]

06:14.207 --> 06:16.960
Let Marco go first.

06:36.980 --> 06:37.981
Tag 'em.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.899
- [gunshots]
- [woman screams]

06:47.574 --> 06:49.117
[Mike breathing heavily]

07:03.340 --> 07:04.424
[growls]

07:06.843 --> 07:09.554
- [gun clicking]
- Hey, good job, Meredith.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.806
I think I popped that one
right in the head! [laughs]

07:11.890 --> 07:14.684
Oh, I won't have to worry
about those goddamn punks anymore, right?

07:14.768 --> 07:18.104
I'll be like Charles Bronson,
"Make my day, motherfucker."

07:18.188 --> 07:20.398
I really wish I didn't hear that,
but that's all right.

07:20.482 --> 07:22.400
You're getting a lot better, though.
You hit the paper this time.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.444
[Meredith] Am I ready
to go on to the machine guns now

07:24.527 --> 07:26.988
or, or those AK-47 thingies?

07:27.072 --> 07:28.448
You're hitting the paper,
that's a good start.

07:28.531 --> 07:30.075
- Yeah, right? Right?
- So how about we just, uh,

07:30.158 --> 07:31.785
stick with this guy a little bit longer?

07:31.868 --> 07:33.370
- Oh, OK.
- And then, uh...

07:33.453 --> 07:34.287
- OK.
- Yeah, then we'll talk

07:34.371 --> 07:35.455
about moving up to a chain gun.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.624
All right, OK.
I don't wanna get too cocky.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.584
- Yes. That's good.
- Get it, cocky? [laughs]

07:39.668 --> 07:41.670
- That's a little pun there.
- Yeah.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.107
[man] Mike. You got a walk-in.

08:02.190 --> 08:04.401
Yeah, I'm busy.
Give it to one of the other guys?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.820
He asked for you specifically.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.857
You're gonna need a scope
if you wanna hit that.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.238
Yeah, maybe.

08:50.321 --> 08:52.115
You got one in that desk
you been hiding behind?

08:52.615 --> 08:54.034
[gunshot]

08:54.367 --> 08:56.286
How's Angie and the kids?

08:56.369 --> 08:59.372
[sighs] Carly just lost her first tooth.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.499
Trevor finally got off
his training wheels.

09:01.583 --> 09:03.376
And Angie...

09:04.711 --> 09:06.713
Well, Angie actually just had lunch
with Beth last week.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.841
- [gunshot]
- And how's she doing?

09:09.924 --> 09:11.718
Shit, I don't know, bro.
Why don't you ask her?

09:11.801 --> 09:12.969
She's your wife.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.057
I'm not alienating any person, but...

09:22.187 --> 09:24.147
- Should've listened to me.
- I made a call.

09:24.230 --> 09:26.357
No, Mike. That wasn't a call.

09:26.441 --> 09:29.235
That was a reaction.
You're a hothead, bro.

09:29.319 --> 09:30.904
Always have been. Just like Dad.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.156
- You wanna bring Dad into this?
- Yeah, because just like Dad,

09:33.239 --> 09:34.532
you got a guy killed.

09:39.204 --> 09:41.498
Avery's putting an op together,
and he wants you on my team.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.459
- [scoffs] Yeah, well, I'm out now.
- Yeah, well, they're reinstating you.

09:45.668 --> 09:48.671
Op brief's at 1300.
Make sure you're there.

09:50.632 --> 09:51.883
That's an order.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.039
[upbeat rock music playing]

10:40.098 --> 10:41.266
[voices in head]

10:41.349 --> 10:42.892
[Chris] <i>You're a hothead, bro.</i>

10:42.976 --> 10:45.061
<i>Always have been. Just like Dad.</i>

10:45.145 --> 10:46.187
- [Mike] <i>You wanna bring Dad into this?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

10:46.271 --> 10:47.856
<i>And just like Dad, you got a man killed.</i>

10:48.606 --> 10:49.440
[gunshots]

11:10.795 --> 11:15.758
Look, I understand the phrase
"love at first sight,"

11:15.842 --> 11:20.054
but all I'm saying is,
how you even know this girl is real?

11:20.138 --> 11:23.516
I mean... [grunts] you got one picture.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.895
She's real.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.354
[Jonesy] Hey, LT.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.148
You ever get a look at Thorpe's

11:30.231 --> 11:32.609
alleged Lithuanian girlfriend?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.277
She's Latvian.

11:34.736 --> 11:35.987
She's not my girlfriend.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.408
You're trying to tell me
that you ain't made a move yet?

11:41.117 --> 11:42.535
When the time is right.

11:43.328 --> 11:45.121
So let me get this straight.

11:45.204 --> 11:49.375
You're seeing some commie girl
from bumfuck wherever

11:49.459 --> 11:53.129
that you think is real
based off of one picture,

11:53.212 --> 11:55.715
and you haven't even had the little balls
to make a move yet?

11:56.382 --> 11:57.842
When the time is right.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.636
I feel for you, Thorpe.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.179
I really do.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.472
You know, I think you might be

12:02.555 --> 12:06.267
the first Navy SEAL in history
to die a virgin.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.311
I mean, unless of course
women ain't really your thing,

12:08.394 --> 12:09.812
in which case...

12:10.563 --> 12:12.941
Navy's actually pretty
inclusive nowadays.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.025
That's right.

12:14.108 --> 12:15.693
I mean, you're always checking me out
when I'm working out.

12:15.777 --> 12:16.819
That's all I'm saying.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.613
But, uh...

12:19.155 --> 12:20.657
guess I can't blame you for that.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.326
You know your protein shakes
are loaded with saccharine.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.955
- Ah, sweet Baby Jesus, no.
- Artificial sweeteners are no joke.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.748
I mean, those compounds
are highly addictive.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.959
When rats were given a choice,

12:31.042 --> 12:32.877
they chose artificial sweeteners
over cocaine.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.712
[blender whirring]

12:34.796 --> 12:36.005
[whirring stops]

12:36.089 --> 12:37.298
Actual cocaine.

12:37.382 --> 12:40.093
[whirring continues]

12:40.176 --> 12:41.177
- [whirring stops]
- Also...

12:41.260 --> 12:43.554
[blender rumbling]

12:50.186 --> 12:51.604
That's about right.

12:51.813 --> 12:52.939
As a medical professional,

12:53.022 --> 12:54.273
you should be more mindful of your health.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.526
This stupid blender's all janky.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.319
Bullshit-ass online reviews.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.199
LT, what's this gig about?

13:03.282 --> 13:04.742
What's with all the secrecy?

13:04.826 --> 13:05.660
Need-to-know.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.495
Yeah, well,
that's a bunch of bullshit, man.

13:07.578 --> 13:08.413
I'm getting sick and tired

13:08.496 --> 13:10.581
of all these little CIA stiffs
coming through,

13:10.665 --> 13:12.917
without one ball between them
to hold up a joystick,

13:13.001 --> 13:15.253
trying to tell us what to do,
like we don't know our jobs or...

13:15.336 --> 13:16.671
[Avery clears throat]

13:18.589 --> 13:19.757
[Avery] Chris.

13:21.801 --> 13:22.969
Sir!

13:24.887 --> 13:25.972
We were told 1300.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.266
These gentlemen wanted
to see where you work.

13:29.267 --> 13:32.812
Agent Maddox, this is Lieutenant Marks,
one of our finest.

13:33.521 --> 13:36.357
Gents,
this is Agent Maddox and Agent Reed.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.192
They'll be going over your briefing.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.528
Which agency?

13:40.611 --> 13:41.988
CIA, NSA?

13:43.239 --> 13:44.365
Take a seat, gentlemen.

13:44.449 --> 13:45.366
[Avery] Chris.

13:46.868 --> 13:47.702
[Chris] Excuse me.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.329
Agent, I'd appreciate
if you don't touch that.

13:50.413 --> 13:53.833
[Avery] Chris, this comes from topside,
from POTUS himself.

13:57.754 --> 14:00.548
There's supposed to be four of them.

14:00.631 --> 14:01.966
Chris, where's your brother?

14:02.633 --> 14:05.094
I honestly doubt he'll show, sir.

14:05.178 --> 14:08.848
Why don't I just bring in somebody else,
like, um, Robinson or Bailey?

14:08.931 --> 14:10.141
No.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.684
I know your brother as well as I know you,

14:11.768 --> 14:14.437
and he's not one to sit on the sidelines
when his number's been called.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.272
With all due respect, sir,

14:16.355 --> 14:18.608
Mike's just not the man that you remember.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.068
[Mike] He's right.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.571
- Think I gained a few pounds.
- [SEALS chuckling]

14:23.654 --> 14:25.073
- [Thorpe] Mikey, how you doing?
- [Mike] Hey, Thorpe.

14:25.156 --> 14:26.866
- [Avery] All right, everybody.
- Hey, leave your walker outside, old man?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.493
[Mike] There's that Jonesy charm.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.704
- Commander.
- Good to see you, Mike.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.624
All right, everyone. Settle and listen up.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.667
I'm gonna hand this meeting
over to these gentlemen.

14:36.751 --> 14:40.171
Agents, these men are my finest.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.839
You know their work.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.925
United States Navy SEALs.

14:44.008 --> 14:45.843
The cream of the crop.

14:45.927 --> 14:50.264
I'm expecting they'll be returned to me
in the same condition they were received.

14:50.348 --> 14:51.224
Hmm?

14:52.350 --> 14:53.810
Here's what we know.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.523
What you're looking at
is a top secret U.S. base

14:58.606 --> 15:00.900
that's located in the forests
of the Caucasus.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.902
The base closed after the Cold War.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.530
Three months after that,
our intelligence team moved in

15:05.613 --> 15:08.825
and resumed operations
of a top secret nature.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.911
That region's tiny.
I didn't know we moved back in.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.288
That's why it's top secret.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.083
- Burn.
- Shut up, Jonesy.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.710
- [Maddox] Are we finished?
- Hey, button up, morons.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.797
The base went dark.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.174
There's been no contact
with anyone in the building

15:25.258 --> 15:26.843
for the past 12 hours.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.928
We need to know why.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.721
Couldn't they have just been overtaken

15:30.805 --> 15:32.473
by some sort of hostile force?

15:32.557 --> 15:33.975
[Maddox] Not likely.

15:34.058 --> 15:35.726
This is the feed from our drone.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.771
We had over a hundred scientists,
engineers,

15:38.980 --> 15:41.774
and a security team working
in and around that building.

15:43.151 --> 15:46.779
This image was taken at 1436 minutes.

15:47.864 --> 15:51.075
This image at 1437 minutes.

15:53.744 --> 15:54.787
Where'd they go?

15:56.372 --> 15:59.125
So you're saying that
in just over one minute,

15:59.208 --> 16:02.420
a hundred people... vanished?

16:02.503 --> 16:04.422
[Maddox] That is exactly what I'm saying.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.965
[Jonesy] Maybe they just, like, ran off

16:06.048 --> 16:07.967
for Thirsty Thursday or some shit,
you know?

16:08.050 --> 16:11.512
I mean, I heard that the bar girls
over that way can be real spicy.

16:11.596 --> 16:14.974
Maybe you should take this shit
a little more seriously.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.100
Petty Officer Jones,

16:16.184 --> 16:19.353
or as your meathead friends
like to call you... Jonesy.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.814
Two counts of insubordination.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.358
Negative marks for inappropriate conduct.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.486
Yeah, and also the best patch-up record

16:26.569 --> 16:28.279
in the history of the SEAL teams.

16:28.362 --> 16:30.239
So trust me, when you're out in the field

16:30.323 --> 16:32.200
getting your ass shot off,

16:32.283 --> 16:33.618
you want Jonesy by your side.

16:33.701 --> 16:36.662
I mean, assuming that you actually,
like, go in the field sometimes.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.332
[chuckles] All right, assholes, listen up.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.876
When I spoke
with the President, personally,

16:41.959 --> 16:44.587
he recommended this team for the job.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.423
I told him you beer-guzzling,
dumbbell-pushing,

16:47.507 --> 16:50.176
trash-talking ingrates weren't qualified.

16:51.302 --> 16:52.845
I wanted to send professionals.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.639
But he chose you.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.641
That might have something to do
with the fact

16:56.724 --> 16:59.977
that we saved his daughter's life
just two years ago.

17:00.061 --> 17:02.146
[Reed] I don't give a flying shit!

17:02.230 --> 17:05.191
I just wanna find out
what happened at that base.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.027
What were they working on?

17:09.612 --> 17:12.073
It's a top secret facility
in some obscure location,

17:12.156 --> 17:13.616
so what are they hiding?

17:13.699 --> 17:15.742
Weapons tech, illegal research, what?

17:21.832 --> 17:24.042
It's classified.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.339
- But we want you to secure that, too.
- OK.

17:28.422 --> 17:31.676
So you want us to go
into a classified compound

17:31.759 --> 17:33.594
built for a classified purpose,

17:33.678 --> 17:36.556
obtain your classified little toy,

17:36.639 --> 17:39.976
before it vaporizes more people
into classified thin air?

17:40.643 --> 17:42.770
- That's right.
- Commander, this is bullshit.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.064
So if we don't even know what it is,

17:45.147 --> 17:46.983
how do we know when we find it?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.401
[Maddox] If you find it...

17:49.277 --> 17:50.361
you'll know.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.200
[Chris] Studying the terrain?

18:00.580 --> 18:01.914
Wasn't it you that always used to say

18:01.998 --> 18:03.749
you can't really know a terrain
until you're standing in it?

18:03.833 --> 18:06.711
There's a lot more that's unknown here
than just the terrain.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.629
This whole op's one big blind spot.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.257
There's a lot more
that they're not telling us.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.592
No shit.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.094
But, hey, that's the job, man.

18:15.511 --> 18:18.931
The job is to complete the mission
and get everyone home safe.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.892
It's a lot harder to do that
when you're given partial intel.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.728
Christ, you ought to know that.

18:29.233 --> 18:30.901
OK, listen up, dude.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.528
There's one thing that
we are gonna get straight right now

18:32.612 --> 18:33.946
before we step outside.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.950
This is my team, Michael.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.201
You understand?

18:39.285 --> 18:41.412
I don't give a shit how much history
you have with the guys.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.664
I'm not gonna have you dicking up
this chain of command.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.626
And you're gonna keep
that temper in check.

18:48.711 --> 18:49.587
Copy?

18:50.755 --> 18:52.923
Copy... LT.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.010
Good. Suit up.

19:12.234 --> 19:14.987
[footfalls]

19:38.928 --> 19:40.137
All right, guys.

19:40.221 --> 19:41.555
We're about a half a klick out.

19:42.223 --> 19:43.933
Mike and I are gonna stay on this heading.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.143
I want you two to circle around,
come in from the west,

19:46.227 --> 19:47.436
and hold up on the perimeter.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.604
Copy that.

20:01.951 --> 20:03.202
Yo.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.704
You good?

20:05.996 --> 20:07.790
Yeah, I'm good.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.251
Then pull your head out of your ass.
I need you here, dude.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.435
- [Jonesy] Weird, isn't it?
- [Thorpe] What's that?

20:28.644 --> 20:31.605
Chris being our LT, Mike on our level.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.151
Well, nobody's on my level,

20:35.234 --> 20:36.485
but you know what I mean.

20:37.153 --> 20:38.404
Yeah, I guess.

20:39.405 --> 20:41.574
- [Jonesy] You don't have an opinion?
- I don't know.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.285
I think they both got their points.

20:46.662 --> 20:49.165
I'm more worried about whatever
they got in this facility.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.668
Government's always hiding shit.

20:52.752 --> 20:55.588
You do know that you work
for the government, right?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.881
This is different.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.551
Conspiracy blogs are always talking
about dark science.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.511
Virus engineering.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.972
Particle splitting.

21:05.055 --> 21:08.100
Just being creative here,
gum that never loses its flavor...

21:09.977 --> 21:11.145
Actually,

21:11.228 --> 21:13.647
did you know that people
who used to live here invented gum?

21:13.731 --> 21:15.274
They would collect the resin
produced from the trees.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.901
Thorpe, yo,
please do not do this right now, man.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.068
- And chew on it.
- I don't wanna hear

21:18.152 --> 21:21.530
- your useless trivia facts bullshit!
- That resin, called chicle,

21:21.614 --> 21:23.032
can still be found in gum today.

21:23.115 --> 21:24.492
That's where the name Chiclets comes from.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.161
You need to get laid, man.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.292
[Mike]
It's ridiculous to insert in daylight.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.545
[Chris] Well, when the POTUS says go,
we go.

21:38.506 --> 21:40.382
So I'm thinking we breach
in a two-by pattern,

21:40.466 --> 21:41.967
give those knuckleheads some cover.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.888
I'll decide when we get there.

21:54.188 --> 21:56.065
Sign says it was a perfume factory.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.859
The only thing I smell is bullshit.

22:02.071 --> 22:02.905
Do you hear that?

22:04.406 --> 22:07.451
[wind whistling]

22:07.535 --> 22:08.661
No, I don't hear anything.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.247
Exactly.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.625
That's what had me so spooked earlier.

22:14.708 --> 22:16.710
There's no animals. There's no birds.

22:17.503 --> 22:18.963
Not even a goddamn mosquito.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.133
If there was anything alive
in this jungle, it's gone now.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.722
Save it for your weekly
psych eval, will you?

22:28.806 --> 22:30.558
Jonesy, Thorpe, what's your 20?

22:32.935 --> 22:34.436
Holding at the perimeter, LT.

22:40.609 --> 22:41.860
Give me eyes.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.625
- Yeah, we're alone.
- Copy.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.419
All right, gentlemen.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.587
We're going in the front.

22:59.670 --> 23:02.047
I got eyes on what looks like
some sort of lobby in there.

23:02.131 --> 23:04.300
- Going in the front?
- Yeah, we're going in the front.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.884
That's rookie shit!
Go to the rear entrance.

23:05.968 --> 23:07.803
- Are you shitting me right now?
- I'm not shitting you!

23:07.886 --> 23:08.929
- Knock it off, Mike.
- Knock what off?

23:09.013 --> 23:10.931
[Mike and Chris arguing over radio]

23:11.015 --> 23:12.641
<i>No, Mike,
the constant bitching and arguing...</i>

23:12.725 --> 23:14.268
I hate it when Mommy and Daddy fight.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.645
Michael, this is my mission.
We're running it my way.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.522
You don't like that,
you can take your happy ass home.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.065
I warned you about this shit.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.401
Like I said, gentlemen,

23:22.484 --> 23:25.154
we're going in the front.
I want heads low and frosty.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.907
Come on.

23:28.991 --> 23:30.367
After you, princess.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.235
Jonesy, check the Geiger.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.197
[clicking]

24:08.280 --> 24:09.573
Slightly above normal,

24:09.657 --> 24:12.201
slightly below
"your dick's gonna fall off."

24:12.284 --> 24:13.452
It's safe.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.745
Thorpe, ring the bell.

24:22.670 --> 24:23.921
[door unlocks]

24:24.004 --> 24:24.838
Breach up.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.469
[Chris] Go!

24:30.552 --> 24:31.595
Go, go, go, go, go!

24:35.683 --> 24:36.684
[door closes]

24:38.602 --> 24:41.146
Anybody else see no dead scientists?

24:45.484 --> 24:46.860
Negative.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.612
Those CIA guys weren't kidding.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.782
Yeah.

24:51.865 --> 24:53.659
I'm still not buying it, though.

24:54.368 --> 24:57.246
I mean, a hundred scientists
don't just up and disappear.

24:57.329 --> 24:58.956
There must be a panic room,
hidden basement,

24:59.039 --> 25:01.959
- someplace where they went hiding.
- All in 60 seconds?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.252
[Thorpe] Look at this.

25:04.002 --> 25:05.879
Security doors. Advanced, too.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.299
Looks like magnesium alloy plating.

25:10.551 --> 25:12.594
That would stop an army
from getting in here.

25:12.678 --> 25:13.887
Yep.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.848
Except that whatever happened
happened so fast

25:15.931 --> 25:18.559
they didn't even have a chance
to seal the doors.

25:18.642 --> 25:20.978
Or before they can
get off a single round.

25:21.061 --> 25:23.522
There's absolutely no signs of engagement.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.191
Maybe we're thinking about this all wrong.

25:27.818 --> 25:30.320
Maybe what happened here
didn't spill in from the outside.

25:31.572 --> 25:33.031
Maybe it all went bad from within.

25:41.081 --> 25:44.042
All right, let's continue
the sweep, guys.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.587
Jonesy, Thorpe, you take left.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.255
Mikey and I are gonna go right.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.091
Give me the play-by-play.

25:56.555 --> 25:59.475
[Jonesy] So what do your conspiracy blogs
make of all this shit?

25:59.558 --> 26:02.811
[Thorpe] I don't know.
I ain't never heard of nothin' like this.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.527
[Jonesy] OK, well, I think
those CIA spooks set us up.

26:11.612 --> 26:14.406
I signed on to kill terrorists, man,
not ghosts.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.867
[Thorpe] You can't kill ghosts.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.702
They're already dead.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.245
Twelve o'clock.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.714
[Jonesy] What the hell is that?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.091
Looks like...

26:33.842 --> 26:35.260
ashes.

26:36.637 --> 26:38.639
- Hmm.
- "Hmm"?

26:39.139 --> 26:40.307
What do you mean, "hmm"?

26:42.017 --> 26:43.602
You act like you know what's going on!

26:50.526 --> 26:51.985
[Jonesy over radio]
<i>...unless you're not also seeing</i>

26:52.069 --> 26:54.613
<i>random-ass piles of ash
over in your neighborhood.</i>

26:54.696 --> 26:55.989
Yeah, copy that, Jonesy.

26:56.073 --> 26:57.825
It's a mess over here, too.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.661
Check it out.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.965
Vanished instantaneously, right?

27:18.887 --> 27:20.264
Stay frosty.

27:21.682 --> 27:22.975
Let's go check out the back.

27:32.860 --> 27:33.902
Goddamn.

27:36.446 --> 27:37.948
What the hell is all this?

27:42.744 --> 27:44.371
Looks like some kind of code.

27:45.289 --> 27:48.208
Maybe they were code crackers,
like in that movie.

27:50.294 --> 27:53.005
[chuckles]

27:53.088 --> 27:54.256
Code crackers.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.592
Code? Crackers?

27:58.719 --> 28:00.053
This ain't no code.

28:01.263 --> 28:02.931
It's a language.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.520
- Clear left.
- Clear right.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.273
Do you smell something?

28:11.356 --> 28:13.233
Yeah, it's like...

28:13.317 --> 28:14.651
like bacon?

28:20.741 --> 28:21.575
[clatter]

28:22.784 --> 28:24.453
[Jonesy over radio]
<i>LT, we found something.</i>

28:25.746 --> 28:26.997
Copy that, Jonesy.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.416
I need you guys
in the northeast sector right now.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.751
We are not alone.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.087
[clatter]

28:38.884 --> 28:40.761
[clattering continues]

28:49.811 --> 28:51.230
Hey!

28:51.313 --> 28:52.522
Don't move.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.988
We're U.S. Navy SEALs.

29:00.072 --> 29:01.073
Goddamnit!

29:03.200 --> 29:04.243
We have a tango in the north wing!

29:04.326 --> 29:06.828
I repeat, we have a tango
in the north wing!

29:06.912 --> 29:08.705
Stop! Hey, stop!

29:14.962 --> 29:15.796
[gunshots]

29:20.634 --> 29:21.802
Great teamwork, guys.

29:21.885 --> 29:24.012
Yeah, we'll mark you down
for the assist on this one.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.019
Get the mask.

29:31.561 --> 29:32.521
[Chris] Relax.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.773
There's nothing harmful in the air.
We already checked.

29:34.856 --> 29:36.316
Except for Thorpe's breath.

29:45.534 --> 29:46.868
What's your name?

29:48.537 --> 29:50.163
Isabella.

29:50.247 --> 29:52.833
- [Chris] What?
- Isabella.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.751
- Isabella Ferreira.
- Running it.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.296
What do you do here, Isabella?

29:58.797 --> 30:00.424
[speaking native language]

30:00.507 --> 30:02.676
- English, please.
- Research soil samples,

30:02.759 --> 30:04.219
but that doesn't matter now.

30:09.016 --> 30:09.891
Jonesy.

30:10.851 --> 30:12.060
Isabella, this is Jonesy.

30:13.520 --> 30:15.105
He is an awesome medic.

30:15.188 --> 30:16.106
He's gonna check you out,

30:16.189 --> 30:17.941
make sure you're all healthy
and everything, OK?

30:18.650 --> 30:21.111
All right, Isabella,
I'm gonna need you to look into this.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.490
Why'd you run from us?

30:25.574 --> 30:26.616
You had guns.

30:26.700 --> 30:28.952
You didn't think that
maybe we were actually here to rescue you?

30:29.036 --> 30:31.079
- You want me to stop and ask questions?
- Guys!

30:32.456 --> 30:34.583
Isabella, deep breath.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.668
[breathing deeply]

30:40.047 --> 30:41.798
I thought you were...

30:42.591 --> 30:43.592
something else.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.011
Good, good.

30:47.012 --> 30:48.722
She's all right, LT.

30:49.639 --> 30:51.350
Something else? Like what?

30:52.476 --> 30:53.894
A mop-up crew.

30:55.604 --> 31:00.025
Whatever those people send in
to contain situations.

31:00.108 --> 31:02.569
So exactly what kind of situation
are you containing here?

31:04.071 --> 31:05.781
What do they tell about this place?

31:05.864 --> 31:08.241
Just that the people here
were working on a classified project.

31:08.325 --> 31:11.119
[scoffs]
Classified project, and that's it?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.996
- [speaking native language]
- Hey, you wanna tell me more...

31:13.080 --> 31:14.164
All right, all right.

31:15.457 --> 31:16.375
Isabella.

31:17.626 --> 31:18.752
Hey, look at me.

31:20.379 --> 31:21.546
What happened here?

31:23.090 --> 31:24.716
Where did all your people go?

31:29.930 --> 31:33.016
- You're really not gonna kill me?
- No.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.938
I'll show you.

31:42.692 --> 31:43.735
[elevator dings]

32:00.127 --> 32:03.338
[upbeat elevator music playing]

32:09.761 --> 32:14.057
[Jonesy humming]

32:19.771 --> 32:20.939
What?

32:22.983 --> 32:24.359
[elevator dings]

32:34.161 --> 32:36.872
- How old is this place?
- I don't know.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.374
The team moved into here three months ago.

32:40.584 --> 32:42.252
What happened three months ago?

32:44.421 --> 32:45.964
The discovery.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.641
Damn.

32:56.725 --> 32:57.934
Nice crib.

32:58.852 --> 33:01.730
So... this is the remodeled wing?

33:03.482 --> 33:04.357
<i>Sí.</i>

33:05.233 --> 33:06.735
Three stories underground.

33:07.652 --> 33:09.946
I'm assuming this basement's lead-lined?

33:10.030 --> 33:11.615
Blocking ground-penetrating radar?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.535
Dark lab.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.041
What are you trying so hard
to hide down here?

33:22.834 --> 33:24.419
What the hell kind of place is this?

33:37.849 --> 33:39.392
If I show you this...

33:39.976 --> 33:42.354
I can go to prison
for the rest of my life.

33:43.271 --> 33:45.565
This is a high-security containment vault.

33:45.649 --> 33:47.984
Nothing can get in or out
once locked down.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.950
[mutters in native language]

33:57.702 --> 33:58.703
[beeps]

34:09.922 --> 34:12.592
[Isabella] We call it "the device."

34:22.686 --> 34:24.145
So what is it?

34:24.938 --> 34:26.773
We must always withhold assumption

34:26.856 --> 34:29.067
on the makeup or purpose of the device.

34:29.150 --> 34:30.360
Withhold assumptions?

34:30.443 --> 34:32.987
So, in other words,
you don't fuckin' know?

34:35.156 --> 34:36.324
No.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.826
But you guys built it, right?

34:38.493 --> 34:41.204
We found it.
Two kilometers away, in the dirt.

34:42.289 --> 34:46.293
Dr. Reiser moved it here
to minimize our impact.

34:46.376 --> 34:49.879
OK, so if you moved it here,
then where did it come from?

34:49.963 --> 34:53.174
We must always withhold
assumption on the origin of...

34:54.842 --> 34:55.969
We don't know that either.

34:56.052 --> 34:58.680
OK, so we don't know what it is,
we don't know where it came from,

34:58.763 --> 35:00.682
but you've been sitting here
staring at it for months.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.267
And in all that time,
what'd you figure out?

35:02.350 --> 35:04.811
It has a language, but we can't read it.

35:05.562 --> 35:07.939
And the material composition
is not periodical.

35:09.399 --> 35:11.026
Or even terrestrial.

35:11.109 --> 35:14.070
Can you say that again
in Bill Nye-level science, please?

35:14.154 --> 35:16.906
She's saying it's not from Earth.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.909
She's saying it landed here
from... up there.

35:23.204 --> 35:24.873
That's just a theory.

35:24.956 --> 35:28.460
Wha... So this place is like
some kind of dusty-fuck Area 52?

35:28.543 --> 35:30.420
That's why they had to stabilize
this region months ago.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.880
They wanted exclusive rights to study it.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.381
Right, OK, so let's stay on the things

35:33.465 --> 35:35.175
that we actually know here
for true, huh, Mike?

35:36.384 --> 35:39.387
So you still haven't explained to us
how you survived this whole thing.

35:40.597 --> 35:42.223
I was in the Faraday room.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.850
The fairy what now?

35:43.933 --> 35:46.770
You're kidding. Michael Faraday, 1800s?

35:46.853 --> 35:47.729
I'm sorry, tiger,

35:47.812 --> 35:50.607
but I missed <i>Jeopardy!</i>
with Grandma last week.

35:50.690 --> 35:54.194
A clean room...
it blocks electromagnetic fields.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.905
That's why I survived.

35:57.781 --> 35:58.948
[Mike] Survived what?

36:00.367 --> 36:01.701
[Isabella voiceover]
<i>The CIA was shutting us down.</i>

36:01.785 --> 36:03.078
<i>They never told us why,</i>

36:03.161 --> 36:05.914
<i>but we had only 20 minutes
to vacate the building.</i>

36:19.260 --> 36:22.972
<i>I just wanted to save my soil samples
from the Faraday room.</i>

36:26.309 --> 36:28.395
[laser humming]

36:54.254 --> 36:56.047
I was just lucky.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.174
Oh, this is so above my pay grade!

36:58.258 --> 36:59.342
It makes sense!

36:59.426 --> 37:01.052
Extraterrestrials would engage
in countermeasures!

37:01.136 --> 37:02.345
Countermeasures?

37:02.429 --> 37:04.639
- Man, I'm not ending up in no dust pan!
- Hey!

37:04.723 --> 37:06.474
We are not gonna start talking
all crazy about this thing.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.518
- You get it?
- There's nothing crazy about this, LT.

37:08.601 --> 37:09.602
There have been multiple accounts of...

37:09.686 --> 37:11.062
- Thorpe.
- ...unidentified flying objects

37:11.146 --> 37:12.230
- dating back to Roswell!
- Whoa!

37:12.313 --> 37:14.023
Extraterrestrial theory is just a theory.

37:14.107 --> 37:15.442
- [Thorpe] I'm just saying!
- Thorpe!

37:15.525 --> 37:17.610
I'm just saying,
we might be sitting on living proof

37:17.694 --> 37:19.070
of life in our universe, right here!

37:19.154 --> 37:21.740
That's why those CIA spooks
was acting so spooky!

37:21.823 --> 37:23.950
Man, I knew I had a bad feeling
about this gig

37:24.033 --> 37:25.368
- right from the beginning!
- That's right!

37:25.452 --> 37:26.995
- [Jonesy] I knew it!
- That's right!

37:27.078 --> 37:28.079
Because it's aliens.

37:28.163 --> 37:29.122
Hey!

37:29.205 --> 37:30.707
Everybody, chill!

37:30.790 --> 37:32.542
Jonesy, Thorpe, zip it.

37:32.625 --> 37:33.835
Right now, we need to...

37:38.631 --> 37:40.508
listen to what our LT has to say.

37:45.305 --> 37:47.474
All right, guys, I get it.

37:47.557 --> 37:49.392
Pucker factor's high right now.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.436
But we've got a mission to do, all right?

37:51.519 --> 37:53.688
Thorpe, I want you to get up on that roof

37:53.772 --> 37:55.940
and get some sort of communication
back to HQ.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.358
Tell them that we got her,

37:57.442 --> 37:59.903
and we've got that damn thing,
and we are ready for extract.

37:59.986 --> 38:02.238
You can't get a signal.
There's a jammer on the roof.

38:03.364 --> 38:06.659
Don't worry about it.
He's some sort of damn techno wizard.

38:06.743 --> 38:08.703
Now, the rest of us are going
to get this thing prepped

38:08.787 --> 38:09.662
and ready for evac.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.956
What? You crazy?

38:12.040 --> 38:14.793
- You want us to move it?
- Yeah.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.878
That's our mission.

38:18.171 --> 38:19.756
I'm not ending up no ash pile.

38:19.839 --> 38:20.882
That's all I'm sayin'.

38:20.965 --> 38:22.717
Give it a rest, Jonesy.

38:22.801 --> 38:24.177
You're making us look bad.

38:34.187 --> 38:36.105
[static noise]

38:55.834 --> 38:57.293
What do you make of all this?

38:58.753 --> 39:00.463
Honestly, bro, I don't even know.

39:00.547 --> 39:02.590
I'm still trying to wrap my whole mind
around this thing.

39:02.674 --> 39:03.758
Yeah, it's fine.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.469
Just don't let the guys see you sweat.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.055
I'm not sweating, Mike.

39:09.138 --> 39:11.724
And I sure as shit
don't need you telling me

39:11.808 --> 39:12.767
how to run this team.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.726
- Yeah, you clearly don't.
- I got it.

39:13.810 --> 39:14.978
Yeah, you got this, right?

39:16.104 --> 39:17.313
[Thorpe over radio] <i>LT. Thorpe. Over.</i>

39:19.440 --> 39:20.567
What you got, Thorpe?

39:20.650 --> 39:22.026
<i>Well, she was right.</i>

39:22.110 --> 39:24.028
<i>They blocked any long-range signal
in or out...</i>

39:24.112 --> 39:25.363
<i>radio, sat phone.</i>

39:25.446 --> 39:26.781
It's quiet as the Western Front.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.116
[Chris] <i>OK, so is that good news?</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:30.368
<i>It's a standard GSM.
I can reboot the system from here.</i>

39:30.451 --> 39:32.620
No, wait a minute. What if they jammed
the system for a reason?

39:32.704 --> 39:33.872
No, dude, we gotta get comms back.

39:33.955 --> 39:36.165
I understand that,
but we need to think for a second here.

39:36.249 --> 39:38.459
Did you just tell me to think
for a second? That's fuckin' brilliant.

39:38.543 --> 39:39.711
[Mike] Yeah, I bet it is, you douche bag.

39:39.794 --> 39:42.130
All right, why did they put in
the signal jammer?

39:42.213 --> 39:44.173
- Hey! Hey!
- [Mike] It had to do something.

39:44.257 --> 39:45.258
[Mike] There's gotta be records here
somewhere.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.302
- [indistinct shouting]
- Yo!

39:48.928 --> 39:51.639
It's... doing something.

39:55.310 --> 39:56.728
Thorpe, stand by.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.700
What in the hell is it doing?

40:12.869 --> 40:13.995
I don't know.

40:16.289 --> 40:17.874
Never done this before.

40:17.957 --> 40:20.793
[whirring]

40:21.502 --> 40:23.546
[typing]

40:25.256 --> 40:26.799
Uh, LT...

40:27.550 --> 40:29.719
<i>I don't think that jammer
was meant for us.</i>

40:30.345 --> 40:33.056
<i>There's another signal,
and it's more complex than ours.</i>

40:33.139 --> 40:35.475
<i>And according to the telemetry, it's...</i>

40:35.558 --> 40:37.310
<i>it's coming from the device.</i>

40:37.393 --> 40:39.354
I think something's phoning home.

40:50.865 --> 40:52.951
UAV's picking up a bogey. We got company.

40:53.034 --> 40:54.410
Is it a plane, like one of our guys?

40:54.494 --> 40:55.536
They said no backup.

40:55.620 --> 40:57.121
And this country doesn't even have
an air force.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.498
No, it's not a fighter,
it's something else.

40:58.581 --> 41:00.333
- Something big.
- All right, let's see the feed.

41:00.416 --> 41:01.793

- What do you got, Mike?
- It's nothing, literally nothing.

- Well, it's gotta be somethin', man!
- There's nothing there!

Is it a plane or something, dude?

41:32.782 --> 41:34.117
Jonesy, keep an eye on that thing.

41:34.200 --> 41:35.702
If it does anything weird at all,
I wanna know about it.

41:35.785 --> 41:37.370
Weird? Are you kidding me?

42:26.085 --> 42:28.004
- You see anything?
- Nothing.

42:29.839 --> 42:31.257
All right, let's get the hell out of here.

42:33.301 --> 42:34.385
Shit!

42:36.596 --> 42:37.597
[grunts]

42:38.347 --> 42:39.682
Right now, they're correcting their range.

42:39.766 --> 42:42.310
Hey, Thorpe, do you see
where that indirect is coming from?

42:42.393 --> 42:44.771
[Thorpe] <i>I hear you, LT,
but I don't see shit up here.</i>

42:44.854 --> 42:47.565
Well, they're gonna hit us again,
so be watching for it.

42:47.648 --> 42:48.941
Copy.

42:49.025 --> 42:50.276
Wait, incoming!

42:50.693 --> 42:53.654
[explosions]

42:57.867 --> 42:59.118
They still don't have our range.

42:59.202 --> 43:00.828
<i>I think they got Stevie Wonder
spotting for them.</i>

43:01.496 --> 43:02.538
You'd think they'd get a little better.

43:02.622 --> 43:03.498
Yeah.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.685
What in God's name?

43:25.895 --> 43:27.939
Maybe... Maybe they're paratroopers?

43:28.689 --> 43:30.358
I don't see any parachutes.

43:32.693 --> 43:34.654
- We need rules of engagement.
- I know what we need, Mike.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.281
All right, listen up, guys.

43:37.365 --> 43:40.326
Nobody fires on these people
unless directly fired upon.

43:40.409 --> 43:41.244
You hear me?

43:41.327 --> 43:42.995
We have no idea
if these here are actually hostile.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.997
They took out a drone.
I say let's blast them.

43:45.081 --> 43:47.750
Copy that.
Got them in my sights, waiting on your go.

43:48.709 --> 43:50.044
Chris?

43:50.128 --> 43:51.212
[Chris] Hey!

43:54.966 --> 43:56.551
This is a restricted area!

43:58.052 --> 44:00.054
Take your men and leave now!

44:06.269 --> 44:09.313
[muffled, distorted voice]
<i>This is a restricted area!</i>

44:11.149 --> 44:15.778
<i>Take your men and leave now!</i>

44:18.322 --> 44:19.657
This is your last warning!

44:19.740 --> 44:22.660
Leave now, or we will open fire!

44:26.914 --> 44:28.666
What are we doing, Chris?

44:30.251 --> 44:32.712
Jonesy, nestle up.
I think we're ready for a fight here.

44:37.133 --> 44:38.676
Shit, they're scanning us.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.684
[Chris] Hit 'em!

44:53.858 --> 44:54.775
What the fuck?

44:56.736 --> 44:58.029
Keep firing!

45:09.498 --> 45:10.625
[Chris] Fall back!

45:10.708 --> 45:12.501
Fall back! Fall back!

45:16.923 --> 45:18.090
I'm going up.

45:18.174 --> 45:19.717
Wait, wait, you can't just leave me here!

45:19.800 --> 45:22.011
I'm not gonna leave my boys
up there to die.

45:22.637 --> 45:23.763
[Mike] <i>Jonesy, come in!</i>

45:23.846 --> 45:24.680
Mike!

45:24.764 --> 45:26.849
Sounds like the goddamn
Fourth of July up there.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.184
<i>I don't have time to explain!</i>

45:28.267 --> 45:29.518
We need to initiate a lockdown!

45:29.602 --> 45:30.937
Mike, no! That'll lock us in here!

45:31.020 --> 45:32.313
[Mike] <i>And keep them out there!</i>

45:32.396 --> 45:34.482
Look, I don't know the protocol
for a lockdown, man.

45:34.565 --> 45:37.526
- [thudding]
- I know that, but she does!

45:38.569 --> 45:39.612
Lobby.

45:39.695 --> 45:42.031
Access panel, but you need this.

45:42.114 --> 45:43.240
OK.

45:43.324 --> 45:44.992
Hold down the fort, Jonesy's coming.

45:45.076 --> 45:46.035
Do you know how to use one of these?

45:46.118 --> 45:47.286
[speaking native language]

45:47.370 --> 45:49.080
Safety's off.
Don't put your finger on the trigger

45:49.163 --> 45:49.997
unless you're gonna shoot.

45:50.081 --> 45:51.540
Don't point at anything
unless you're gonna shoot,

45:51.624 --> 45:54.085
and do both if you see
any little green men.

45:55.378 --> 45:58.255
- J-Jonesy! Jonesy!
- Squeeze the trigger, don't pull!

45:59.465 --> 46:01.342
- Hey.
- Yeah.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.846
[Mike] Back up!

46:05.930 --> 46:07.306
[explosion]

46:08.140 --> 46:09.558
These doors aren't
gonna hold for long, man.

46:10.935 --> 46:11.936
Come on, Jonesy.

46:12.019 --> 46:12.937
Where the hell are you?

46:16.023 --> 46:18.234
[panting]

46:18.985 --> 46:20.444
[grunts]

46:25.032 --> 46:25.866
[Jonesy] <i>Mike!</i>

46:26.617 --> 46:27.576
<i>I've got the card!</i>

46:29.286 --> 46:31.080
Chris, I need to tell you something.

46:31.998 --> 46:33.290
Don't be getting all sentimental
on me, bro.

46:33.374 --> 46:34.333
This is important.

46:35.376 --> 46:37.211
I got the card to lock the door!

46:37.294 --> 46:38.587
Jonesy, take cover!

46:38.671 --> 46:39.505
[Jonesy grunts]

46:41.549 --> 46:43.801
[panting]

46:43.884 --> 46:45.386
[Mike] Jonesy, throw the card over!

46:49.181 --> 46:50.016
Here!

46:50.725 --> 46:51.559
[Mike] Chris!

46:57.648 --> 46:59.066
[panting]

46:59.150 --> 47:00.109
Bullshit!

47:02.069 --> 47:03.154
Jonesy, you OK?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.908
[door opens]

47:11.537 --> 47:12.830
[Thorpe] Ohh.

47:14.915 --> 47:16.250
Told you it was aliens.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.631
[upbeat elevator music]

47:30.181 --> 47:32.641
[Jonesy humming]

47:35.311 --> 47:37.688
[beatboxing]

47:45.613 --> 47:46.781
Shit, man, that burns!

47:46.864 --> 47:49.575
Shut up, you big baby. You're alive.

47:49.658 --> 47:51.744
[Chris] All right, guys. I'm at 50% ammo.

47:51.827 --> 47:53.662
I want a count from all of you ASAP.

47:53.746 --> 47:55.915
- You mean the ammo that can disappear?
- Listen.

47:55.998 --> 47:58.250
As far as we're concerned,
we have four hostiles upstairs.

47:58.334 --> 47:59.293
I don't give a shit

47:59.376 --> 48:01.253
if they're from Mars or Missouri
or wherever, all right?

48:01.337 --> 48:03.380
Hey. Can you hack us
into the security feed?

48:03.464 --> 48:04.673
I wanna track these bastards' movements.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.717
- <i>Sí,</i> five minutes.
- Track their movement...

48:06.801 --> 48:08.260
What do you wanna track
their movements for?

48:08.344 --> 48:10.221
We know what they want.
They're after that thing!

48:14.558 --> 48:16.435
Look, look, I say we roll it out to them.

48:16.519 --> 48:18.979
For all we know, that thing's
a goddamn alien atom bomb.

48:19.063 --> 48:20.648
What... [scoffs]

48:20.731 --> 48:23.067
Mike, what do you think we should do?

48:33.828 --> 48:35.663
Hey, when that blast
killed your co-workers,

48:35.746 --> 48:37.414
it killed all the animals
outside too, right?

48:37.498 --> 48:39.458
- Yes.
- But it didn't kill the trees.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.836
- So what's your point, Mike?
- Yeah, my point is that this thing chooses

48:41.919 --> 48:43.420
what it will and will not kill.

48:43.504 --> 48:44.922
OK? I think this whole operation's

48:45.005 --> 48:46.966
a part of a whole worldwide operation.

48:47.049 --> 48:50.344
They drop a bomb three months ago,
but we get lucky, it was a dud,

48:50.427 --> 48:51.846
and now they're back to fix the wiring.

48:53.264 --> 48:55.224
That's why the CIA told you to leave.

48:55.307 --> 48:56.350
They knew the tangos were here,

48:56.433 --> 48:58.310
but the signal jammer
was keeping it hidden...

48:58.394 --> 48:59.395
until we got here.

48:59.478 --> 49:01.272
- [Chris] That is complete speculation.
- It's intelligence.

49:01.355 --> 49:02.982
Why else would they be here?

49:03.065 --> 49:05.568
If they get their tentacles on this thing,

49:05.651 --> 49:08.154
then they can wipe out humanity
with a touch of a button

49:08.237 --> 49:09.572
and stroll on to their new planet.

49:10.823 --> 49:12.533
An invasion.

49:13.826 --> 49:15.119
Exactly.

49:16.162 --> 49:17.329
An invasion.

49:39.351 --> 49:40.603
You gotta be kidding me.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.230
Man, a vessel like this needs sustenance

49:43.314 --> 49:44.398
every three hours.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.025
I'm mellowing out.

49:46.108 --> 49:47.818
We're dealing
with the most existential crisis

49:47.902 --> 49:50.154
of the century,
and you're making protein shakes.

49:50.237 --> 49:53.115
You know, Thorpe, I like you.

49:53.199 --> 49:54.533
I really do.

49:54.617 --> 49:55.910
And that's why...

49:57.494 --> 49:58.787
I'm gonna teach you something.

50:02.541 --> 50:04.710
[keys clacking]

50:07.379 --> 50:08.380
Hey.

50:09.131 --> 50:11.008
Um, <i>oi?</i>

50:11.091 --> 50:14.136
It's a bit hot in here, right?

50:15.095 --> 50:16.388
Am I right?

50:17.056 --> 50:19.433
We actually keep the lab
below room temperature.

50:19.516 --> 50:21.936
That's why we wear lab coats.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.229
Mmm.

50:23.312 --> 50:25.397
I guess I just must be a little more...

50:26.023 --> 50:28.275
insulated than others.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.820
Maybe that's because
you're wearing a T-shirt

50:31.904 --> 50:33.280
from a teenage boy.

50:33.364 --> 50:34.365
What do you think?

50:40.162 --> 50:43.457
I'ma be over... here.

50:45.084 --> 50:46.460
Imbecile.

50:53.259 --> 50:54.260
Hey.

50:55.094 --> 50:55.928
All right, dude, listen.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.972
I know that I was a little bit rattled
there a little while ago.

50:58.055 --> 50:59.932
Yeah, we all gotta pick
each other up, it's all right.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.308
Yeah, but the problem is, Mike,

51:01.392 --> 51:03.435
is that then the guys start
looking to you for orders.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.854
I'm sure it's just muscle memory,
if anything.

51:05.938 --> 51:06.939
No, Mike.

51:07.022 --> 51:09.608
Then you started jumping in there
and giving them pretty damn fast.

51:11.068 --> 51:12.403
Is that muscle memory, too?

51:16.490 --> 51:18.325
Hey, guys, come here!

51:22.288 --> 51:23.247
Is that them?

51:24.623 --> 51:26.375
[Jonesy] What did you expect,
little green men?

51:27.042 --> 51:28.961
No, I expected them to be like us.

51:29.044 --> 51:31.588
Evolution is linear,
moves in straight line.

51:31.672 --> 51:33.799
Yeah, she's right.
It's not surprising they're bipedal.

51:33.882 --> 51:36.719
Theoretical extrabiology suggests
they'd be very similar to us.

51:36.802 --> 51:38.095
Well, there's one thing
that's very similar to us.

51:38.178 --> 51:39.179
Look at the way they're moving.

51:47.313 --> 51:49.940
Tactical. Definitely military...
at least their version of it.

51:51.358 --> 51:52.443
What are they building?

51:53.527 --> 51:55.821
- What is that?
- It looks like a shield,

51:55.904 --> 51:57.990
plasma or just concentrated electricity.

51:59.408 --> 52:01.118
A barricade, to keep us boxed in.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.786
- How you know?
- Because that's what we would do.

52:12.755 --> 52:13.589
OK, guys.

52:14.673 --> 52:18.135
We have four hostiles
with advanced military training,

52:18.218 --> 52:19.678
and the little shitheads
have us boxed in.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.138
And they have their eyes set on a weapon

52:21.221 --> 52:23.599
of mass destruction
that'll wipe out planet Earth.

52:23.682 --> 52:24.683
In theory.

52:26.226 --> 52:27.353
Either way, we need backup.

52:28.437 --> 52:30.814
Dude... is there any way

52:30.898 --> 52:32.399
that you can get some communication
back to HQ?

52:32.483 --> 52:33.984
The CIA might know something
about these guys.

52:34.068 --> 52:35.194
Yeah, I saw a hard line on the roof.

52:35.277 --> 52:37.363
I can use the sat phone,
but someone's gonna have to patch a line

52:37.446 --> 52:39.406
- in their communication.
- Great. Where's that?

52:40.282 --> 52:43.243
Shit. Lobby, where we just came from.

52:43.327 --> 52:45.162
Fantastic.

52:45.245 --> 52:48.165
All right. Thorpe, you're our eyes, dude.

52:48.248 --> 52:49.541
The rest of us,
we're all heading up topside

52:49.625 --> 52:51.710
in case that place turns
into a shooting gallery again.

52:51.794 --> 52:52.753
- Hooyah?
- [team] Hooyah.

52:52.836 --> 52:53.670
[Chris] Let's do it.

52:57.966 --> 53:00.052
Gonna go kick me some alien ass!

53:02.679 --> 53:03.764
What's this?

53:04.431 --> 53:06.475
It's nothing.

53:06.558 --> 53:08.102
Doesn't look like nothing.

53:10.687 --> 53:12.356
It's the code, isn't it?

53:12.439 --> 53:13.315
No.

53:14.358 --> 53:16.110
I mean, yes.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.532
My degree's in biology,

53:22.074 --> 53:24.076
but my hobby's in theoretical language.

53:24.952 --> 53:26.245
[speaks native language]

53:26.328 --> 53:27.913
Cryptography.

53:27.996 --> 53:30.499
I know, it's... boring stuff.

53:31.250 --> 53:32.876
Alphabetic verse pictographic systems?

53:33.710 --> 53:36.046
Yes. I have a theory.

53:37.214 --> 53:39.758
I believe their language
is more than just words.

53:39.842 --> 53:43.720
It's emotions, sensations,
math, science, astronomy.

53:43.804 --> 53:45.431
The perfect language.

53:46.557 --> 53:49.476
I just never found the through line.

53:50.978 --> 53:52.521
It says here there were
more glyphs when it started.

53:52.604 --> 53:55.899
Yeah, it could be
like a power percentage,

53:55.983 --> 53:57.192
like a battery.

54:00.612 --> 54:01.864
Or it could be a countdown.

54:03.365 --> 54:04.908
That's another theory.

54:14.460 --> 54:15.669
[Chris] Clear left.

54:15.752 --> 54:16.587
[Mike] Clear right.

54:16.670 --> 54:17.838
[Chris] All clear.

54:22.217 --> 54:26.430
So you guys said that
they stopped your bullets, right?

54:26.513 --> 54:27.347
[Mike] Right.

54:28.474 --> 54:29.308
So...

54:31.310 --> 54:34.313
why exactly are we bringing our guns?

54:34.396 --> 54:37.232
Well, if you wanna drop your rifle
and continue without it,

54:37.316 --> 54:38.942
be my guest. Sound good to you, LT?

54:39.026 --> 54:39.902
Oh, yeah.

54:43.739 --> 54:46.200
Yeah, we all know how much you corpsmen
hate carrying anything heavy.

54:47.451 --> 54:48.452
[laughs]

54:48.535 --> 54:49.745
[Jonesy]
I'm gonna remember that next time

54:49.828 --> 54:51.705
you two have bullets in your asses.

54:54.875 --> 54:55.959
[Mike] All right.

54:56.502 --> 54:57.711
Coming up on the lobby.

55:02.883 --> 55:04.134
- Clear.
- Clear.

55:04.760 --> 55:05.928
Go!

55:27.741 --> 55:29.660
The steel door's intact.
They're still outside.

55:29.743 --> 55:30.577
Get to it.

55:40.587 --> 55:43.006
[electrical whirring]

55:47.928 --> 55:50.305
Hey, how do you know
what line to plug into anyway?

55:50.389 --> 55:52.391
[Mike] It's a retro system, pre-WiFi.

55:52.474 --> 55:54.309
Should just be one or two telephone wires.

56:00.232 --> 56:01.692
Terrific.

56:08.532 --> 56:10.367
- Shit.
- [Chris] I thought you said,

56:10.450 --> 56:11.785
[mocking] "Oh, there's only
gonna be, like, two wires."

56:11.868 --> 56:14.288
Oh, yeah, ha ha. OK, I'm not the one
who failed out of computer science, bro.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.498
Hey, OK, well, listen up dude, I...
this isn't actually that complicated.

56:16.582 --> 56:18.333
Oh, I bet it is, man!

56:18.417 --> 56:19.251
[Chris] Look inside of this thing.

56:19.334 --> 56:20.961
- Are you seeing this?
- [Mike] Yes, I see what I'm seeing...

56:21.044 --> 56:23.255
- [Chris] But it's not that complicated!
- [Mike] You're a fucking idiot!

56:23.338 --> 56:26.508
[muffled, distorted voice]
<i>I want you to stop what you're doing</i>

56:26.592 --> 56:28.719
<i>and jack into the coax!</i>

56:28.802 --> 56:30.804
Mike! Just jack into the coax!

56:30.887 --> 56:32.472
I know how to read an access panel!

56:32.556 --> 56:33.890
Man, it's the red wire.

56:33.974 --> 56:35.183
It's always the red wire.

56:35.267 --> 56:36.935
[both] Jonesy, shut up!

56:40.606 --> 56:43.400
LT, got a tango
right outside the security door.

56:45.068 --> 56:46.945
- [Mike] Shit.
- Roger that, man.

56:47.404 --> 56:50.157
- We are in a freakin' kill zone right now.
- [Mike] What?

56:50.240 --> 56:51.241
What's he doing?

56:51.325 --> 56:52.868
- Mike.
- Working on it.

56:57.623 --> 56:59.458
Actually, sir, I think this one's a she.

56:59.541 --> 57:02.169
I don't care if it's wearing
high heels and a skirt, OK?

57:02.252 --> 57:03.837
All I wanna know is what it's doing.

57:11.637 --> 57:13.221
LT, she's gone.

57:13.305 --> 57:15.432
What do you mean she's gone?

57:15.515 --> 57:16.683
[Thorpe] <i>I-I don't know.</i>

57:16.767 --> 57:19.561
<i>Maybe the feed's glitching,
but she's not there anymore.</i>

57:19.645 --> 57:20.896
Well, where the hell is she?

57:20.979 --> 57:22.064
[Mike] Got it, patching in!

57:25.943 --> 57:27.945
- Get down!
- [all grunt]

57:37.287 --> 57:38.789
Oh, hell no!

57:39.915 --> 57:40.791
[Jonesy grunts]

57:40.874 --> 57:41.708
[thud]

57:44.628 --> 57:45.712
[muffled, distorted] <i>Get down!</i>

57:57.307 --> 57:58.517
Jonesy, you alive?

57:59.434 --> 58:00.686
Did you kill her?

58:01.687 --> 58:03.271
[Mike] Yeah, I think so.

58:07.192 --> 58:09.319
Easy, Jonesy. Careful with that thing.

58:11.488 --> 58:14.574
Where is she?
Where is she? I'm gonna kill her.

58:14.658 --> 58:16.410
[Mike] I don't know, man.
You see how fast she moves.

58:24.876 --> 58:26.837
Oh, you have gotta be kidding me.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.006
- [Chris] Get down!
- [Mike] Jonesy, get down!

58:32.592 --> 58:35.345
Jonesy, get that thing back to the lab.
Mike and I got this!

58:40.058 --> 58:42.102
- Get the sat phone!
- Got it.

58:42.185 --> 58:44.021
[Mike roars]

58:44.104 --> 58:45.480
[grunting]

58:46.189 --> 58:47.482
Run!

58:47.566 --> 58:48.525
Go, man, go!

58:50.694 --> 58:51.862
[whirring]

58:53.155 --> 58:54.573
[Chris groans]

58:57.826 --> 58:58.869
[grunting]

59:07.085 --> 59:09.504
[static noise]

59:10.255 --> 59:11.757
Come on, let's go, let's go.

59:11.840 --> 59:13.675
Let's go! Run!

59:13.759 --> 59:15.677
[static noise continues]

59:19.723 --> 59:21.391
[Thorpe] Jonesy, talk to me, buddy.

59:21.475 --> 59:24.019
We've been breached.
Those assholes can teleport.

59:24.102 --> 59:26.104
That's some straight up
bullshit right there!

59:26.188 --> 59:27.314
Is that what I think it is?

59:27.397 --> 59:29.983
If you think that it's the alien ray gun
from outer space, then yes.

59:30.067 --> 59:32.319
- Yes, it is.
- It's beautiful.

59:47.626 --> 59:50.796
Jonesy, dude. I said I'm fine.

59:53.924 --> 59:56.635
We got bigger problems than me, man.
Anything at all?

59:56.718 --> 59:59.679
Circuit boards are fused together.
It's toast.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:03.308
So are we.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.644
"So are we"?
What do you mean, "So are we"?

01:00:05.727 --> 01:00:07.729
He means that we're sitting
at less than 10% ammo

01:00:07.813 --> 01:00:10.899
and that that thing was our only way
to call for reinforcements.

01:00:10.982 --> 01:00:12.234
So without doing that,

01:00:12.317 --> 01:00:14.861
they're not even gonna
start looking for us for...

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:16.279
almost seven hours.

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:17.989
Seven hours?

01:00:18.073 --> 01:00:20.867
We can't survive seven more hours
from those things!

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.786
Like the man said...

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:24.037
toast.

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.248
[speaking native language]

01:00:26.331 --> 01:00:28.333
You do know we can
understand that, right?

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.252
What about that gun?

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:33.171
- We hit them with their own medicine.
- [Chris] Nope.

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.881
Doesn't work.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:37.717
It's probably linked to their DNA
or some lame-ass shit.

01:00:39.803 --> 01:00:41.263
We're gonna die.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.514
We're gonna die.

01:00:43.682 --> 01:00:45.142
[Mike] No, we're not.

01:00:48.395 --> 01:00:50.981
We are United States Navy SEALs,

01:00:51.064 --> 01:00:52.607
and we don't quit.

01:00:54.025 --> 01:00:55.527
We never have. We never will.

01:00:57.696 --> 01:00:58.989
What's our sitrep right now?

01:00:59.698 --> 01:01:01.575
Low on ammo, OK.

01:01:02.534 --> 01:01:04.870
Got tangos with superior fire power,
all right.

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:08.832
[Jonesy] But they are down a barrel.

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.083
Exactly.

01:01:12.627 --> 01:01:14.379
They're missing something else, too.

01:01:16.006 --> 01:01:17.090
A leader.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.343
Someone who when your back
is up against the wall

01:01:20.427 --> 01:01:22.387
is gonna see you through that shit.

01:01:24.431 --> 01:01:26.016
And that's our LT.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:28.685
That's my brother.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.690
Well, Chris...

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.693
awaiting orders.

01:01:41.615 --> 01:01:42.866
All right.

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:52.000
Mikey, did you notice
when that laser bolt hit that radio

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.461
how that thing went
absolutely batshit crazy?

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:56.213
Yeah, like it got a migraine from hell.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.964
[Jonesy]
So what, you're trying to tell me that

01:01:58.048 --> 01:02:00.467
they're allergic to phones?

01:02:01.176 --> 01:02:02.427
Yes!

01:02:02.928 --> 01:02:05.388
I mean... no.

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:08.642
[speaking native language]

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.143
Electrolocation.

01:02:10.852 --> 01:02:11.937
What, like bats?

01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.897
No, no, no. Bats use echolocation.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.232
That's through sound.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.776
Electrolocation is reading
electrical stimuli.

01:02:17.859 --> 01:02:19.152
Dolphins use it to track prey.

01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.238
And sharks.

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.823
They can see electricity.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:26.409
They can even see electricity
from inside your body.

01:02:26.493 --> 01:02:27.994
So you're saying
when it tagged that sat phone,

01:02:28.078 --> 01:02:29.621
its vision was disrupted?

01:02:29.704 --> 01:02:31.915
More like overstimulated.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:34.042
Just like when somebody blinds
with a flashlight.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:36.211
Sounds like a chink in the armor.

01:02:36.294 --> 01:02:38.922
So we what, just start
shooting up all the electronics?

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.759
<i>Sí,</i> but that's not enough.

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:45.971
You boys gonna need something
much bigger than that.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:48.181
[Mike] You've got an idea?

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.351
I've got an idea.

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:54.479
This building's running on backup power,

01:02:54.562 --> 01:02:57.357
but the main generator
is big enough to run a city.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.942
So if we fire that thing up,
that'll blind 'em.

01:02:59.025 --> 01:03:00.944
Exactly, but only for a minute.

01:03:01.027 --> 01:03:03.280
That's all the time
I'ma need to pop the little bastards.

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:05.991
- Where's the generator room?
- That's the bad news.

01:03:06.074 --> 01:03:07.784
First floor.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:10.578
So someone's gonna have to slip past
the hall monitors up there.

01:03:11.913 --> 01:03:13.540
Wait. I have an idea.

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.214
Faraday suit. It works like the room.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.424
But it's a suit.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:25.343
That would hide the electrical impulses
in our bodies.

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.512
- We'd be invisible.
- Great.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:28.638
So you wouldn't just happen to have,

01:03:28.722 --> 01:03:30.682
like, four of those lying around,
would you?

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.767
That's a prototype.

01:03:33.643 --> 01:03:34.894
OK.

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:37.063
So let me get this straight then.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:39.482
One of us dons the suit,

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:42.068
slips into the generator room,
fires it up,

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:43.945
and then when they're all blind,
the other guys smoke 'em.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.155
In order for this to work,

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:46.781
we need to get all the bastards
in one spot.

01:03:46.865 --> 01:03:48.283
We're gonna need to bait 'em.

01:04:00.545 --> 01:04:03.173
Start gathering up every piece
of electronic you can find.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.718
Radios, televisions,
toasters, TVs, anything.

01:04:07.969 --> 01:04:10.221
Absolutely anything
with an electronic pulse.

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:16.686
Yo, yo, yo, watch the blender, man!

01:04:16.936 --> 01:04:18.772
Man, that is a NutriGrinder Plus,

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:20.690
and I'm taking it home
when we're through with all this shit.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:21.608
Jonesy.

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:24.694
Look, you can't find
a NutriGrinder Plus no more, Lieutenant!

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:26.488
Man, I done looked all up and down eBay.

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:28.365
More watts than a house of light bulbs.

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.951
That thing makes the best protein shakes
in the world!

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:40.627
Look, I need my protein shakes, OK?

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.046
And I am not gonna be flexible
about this shit!

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:49.427
OK. You can have the blender.

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:50.720
Thank you!

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.070
[low buzzing]

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:15.787
What the hell are you doing?

01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.330
Only room for one, bro.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.873
Yeah, I'm in the suit.

01:05:20.625 --> 01:05:22.127
Then who's gonna lead us?

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.464
I got this. You got this.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.052
You know what?

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:34.472
You wear the suit. That's an order.

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.436
Then the rest of us,
we're gonna get in our positions.

01:05:39.519 --> 01:05:40.603
- Hooyah?
- [team] Hooyah.

01:05:40.687 --> 01:05:41.855
- Hooyah?
- Hooyah!

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:46.234
[upbeat elevator music]

01:05:51.281 --> 01:05:52.657
[elevator dings]

01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:58.663
Guys.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.206
Tango dead ahead.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.250
Don't move!

01:06:02.333 --> 01:06:04.252
<i>He can't see you if you don't move!</i>

01:06:04.335 --> 01:06:05.962
[music continues]

01:06:12.844 --> 01:06:14.846
[music continues]

01:06:34.115 --> 01:06:35.575
[music stops]

01:06:52.884 --> 01:06:55.303
[Mike]
<i>Guys, I have eyes on tango now.</i>

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.393
- All clear.
- [Chris] <i>Roger that.</i>

01:07:02.477 --> 01:07:04.145
Good luck, boys.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.263
Shit.

01:07:40.014 --> 01:07:41.266
Come on, Thorpe.

01:07:45.353 --> 01:07:47.480
[static noise]

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:49.941
Come and get it.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:08.084
[Chris] How long
till they get the message?

01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.544
Not long.

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:14.674
Mike, the trap is set.
I repeat. The trap is set.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:21.848
I'm coming up on the main hallway.

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:23.975
<i>Generator room now in sight.</i>

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:33.984
Isabella, I feel like
this isn't the generator room.

01:08:41.743 --> 01:08:43.620
Isabella...

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.413
big guy's here, and I think he can see me.

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.752
[Isabella]
<i>That's not possible.</i>

01:08:50.835 --> 01:08:53.254
It looks like he's trying
to make me out or somethin'.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:05.642
Isabella, he's looking right at me.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:07.477
[speaks native language]

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:08.685
[Mike] <i>English, please.</i>

01:09:08.770 --> 01:09:09.812
Static.

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:13.399
The suit blocks your electricity,

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:17.362
<i>but it's building up static electricity
when you walk.</i>

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:18.571
You gotta be kiddin' me.

01:09:18.654 --> 01:09:23.283
The more you walk,
more static electricity he can see.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.794
You have to release the static charge.

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:35.630
Bella, I'm losing you.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.633
Gimme somethin' here.

01:09:39.133 --> 01:09:41.719
[Isabella] <i>Whatever you do,
don't touch anything metal.</i>

01:09:45.223 --> 01:09:46.265
Screw it.

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.553
Contact front!

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:31.602
Isabella, where's the generator room?

01:10:31.686 --> 01:10:33.271
Is this thing following me?

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.734
OK, look for door 186.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:43.823
- Right!
- [gunfire]

01:10:43.906 --> 01:10:44.949
Any day now, Mike.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:47.452
[gunfire]

01:10:47.535 --> 01:10:48.369
Cover!

01:10:50.788 --> 01:10:52.206
I'm running low!

01:10:53.416 --> 01:10:54.834
[Chris] Contact left!

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:03.259
[Mike] Isabella, I'm in.
I can hear the big guy coming in.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.470
That door is three inches of steel.

01:11:06.262 --> 01:11:09.098
- [banging on door]
- Uh, I don't think it's gonna hold.

01:11:09.182 --> 01:11:11.058
[Isabella] <i>There's no way he can get in.</i>

01:11:12.810 --> 01:11:14.187
I think I made it.

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:16.898
What do I do now?

01:11:16.981 --> 01:11:18.775
[Isabella] <i>The keys are on the wall.</i>

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:26.073
Oh, come on!

01:11:27.116 --> 01:11:28.618
[Thorpe] Contact front!

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.036
[gunfire]

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.420
Reload! Dude.

01:11:39.504 --> 01:11:42.173
What are they doing?
Why aren't they firing at us?

01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:47.136
Holy shit. They're draining our ammo.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:50.264
Shoot the electronics.

01:11:51.140 --> 01:11:52.558
[gunfire]

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:54.060
[buzzing]

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.814
Not the blender! Do not shoot the blender!

01:12:08.449 --> 01:12:10.868
- No!
- [Thorpe] Jonesy!

01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:13.538
[Jonesy roars]

01:12:15.498 --> 01:12:18.125
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

01:12:22.755 --> 01:12:24.215
I'm sick of this shit!

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.384
Really... liked...

01:12:26.467 --> 01:12:27.969
that... blender!

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:32.765
[zapping]

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:36.477
Shit!

01:12:36.561 --> 01:12:37.436
[Jonesy grunts]

01:12:38.312 --> 01:12:40.481
Shit! [grunts]

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.774
[whooshing]

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:43.109
What?

01:12:44.235 --> 01:12:45.236
[grunts]

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.157
Sick of this shit!

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.577
[Chris] <i>Mike! Come on, man, we need you!</i>

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:53.703
I'm trying!

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:55.913
I'm a Navy SEAL, not a goddamn janitor!

01:12:58.124 --> 01:12:59.542
I'm a Navy fuckin' SEAL.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:02.962
[gunshot]

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:04.213
[Jonesy grunts]

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.381
Shit!

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:06.299
[grunts]

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:08.843
No!

01:13:12.138 --> 01:13:14.390
[gasping]

01:13:19.437 --> 01:13:21.022
[gasping continues]

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.441
It's... it's beautiful.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:25.192
[grunts]

01:13:26.319 --> 01:13:27.737
[Jonesy] Aah!

01:13:37.955 --> 01:13:39.624
Hold, hold...

01:13:39.707 --> 01:13:41.584
- Wakey-wakey.
- Smoke 'em!

01:13:47.298 --> 01:13:49.592
[Chris distorted] <i>Aah! Destroy them!</i>

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.597
[roars] Come on, you shits!

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:59.310
[gunfire]

01:13:59.393 --> 01:14:01.520
[roaring]

01:14:03.689 --> 01:14:05.524
LT! I think we got 'em!

01:14:11.322 --> 01:14:13.741
[Chris]
<i>All clear, Mike, they're gone.</i>

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.878
- [Jonesy panting]
- Jonesy, you good?

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.006
[retches]

01:14:32.093 --> 01:14:33.427
[door opens]

01:14:34.762 --> 01:14:36.055
It's me.

01:14:42.144 --> 01:14:43.604
Did we get 'em?

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.482
Yeah. I think we did.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.071
Chris!

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.115
Goddamnit!

01:14:59.745 --> 01:15:02.081
Come on, Mike, let's go. Let's go!

01:15:15.594 --> 01:15:17.013
What do you guys want?

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.362
Hey. What do you want?

01:15:40.369 --> 01:15:42.788
[muffled, distorted voice]
<i>Hey! What do you want?</i>

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.544
What do you want?
Just tell me what you guys want from me!

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:50.921
Hey! What do you want?

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:52.381
Tell me!

01:15:56.719 --> 01:15:58.554
We're going in and hitting
with everything we got.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:01.557
We'd be walking into an ambush. Besides,
it looks like they wanna negotiate.

01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.935
I don't give a shit about them!
Chris is gone! I'm in command!

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:06.812
I say we hit them with force!
It's the only thing they understand!

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:08.064
Yo, LT, wait.

01:16:08.147 --> 01:16:10.191
I really don't know about that, man.
I saw their home.

01:16:10.983 --> 01:16:12.193
What?

01:16:12.651 --> 01:16:14.779
Wh... When she did
the teleporting thing, man,

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:16.697
I saw a city.

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:18.657
It was... It was shaped like a beach shell.

01:16:18.741 --> 01:16:21.535
It was... it was peaceful.

01:16:21.619 --> 01:16:23.704
- Beach shell?
- Yeah.

01:16:28.209 --> 01:16:30.753
- Does it look like this?
- Exactly like that!

01:16:31.545 --> 01:16:33.047
[Isabella, Thorpe] Fibonacci sequence!

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:36.383
[stammers] I'm sorry, what?

01:16:36.467 --> 01:16:38.094
Fibonacci sequence
is a mathematical pattern!

01:16:38.177 --> 01:16:39.470
It's found everywhere in nature...

01:16:39.553 --> 01:16:42.348
shells, DNA... and that thing!

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:46.769
I always tried to read their language
in a straight line.

01:16:46.852 --> 01:16:48.729
If I read it in a spiral...

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:51.440
- Then that's your through line.
- Exactly.

01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:53.651
What are you doing? That thing is a bomb!

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.027
I don't think it's a bomb.

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:04.411
[device hissing]

01:17:17.091 --> 01:17:18.384

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:23.389
[crackling]

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.024
I think we found our bargaining chip.

01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:55.087
[metallic door slides]

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:28.954

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:31.707
Oh, just chillin'.

01:18:31.790 --> 01:18:32.917
You?

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:36.337
Chillin'.

01:18:38.923 --> 01:18:41.425
Isabella! You're up.

01:18:51.268 --> 01:18:54.230
[static noise]

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:41.777
It wasn't a bomb. It's a life pod.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:45.281
Crashed here,
they've been looking for it ever since.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.162
All right.

01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:54.581
Listen up, you slimy bastards.

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:56.417
You give me my bro...

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:00.796
I'll give you your boy. Deal?

01:20:01.880 --> 01:20:03.382
Mike.

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:10.639
- [Chris] Mike.
- I got this.

01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.902
Drop your weapons.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:27.406
That's an order.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.653
[ethereal whirring]

01:22:33.365 --> 01:22:35.367
[whirring accelerates]

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.377
- [sonic boom]
- The old Irish goodbye.

01:22:48.046 --> 01:22:49.631
Fibonacci sequence.

01:22:58.515 --> 01:22:59.725
Well...

01:23:01.185 --> 01:23:02.561
what's the call, LT?

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:07.608
I'm thinkin' a beer.

01:23:09.359 --> 01:23:10.736
Copy that.

01:23:21.038 --> 01:23:23.290
The more and more that I think about it,
I think that we need to just stay

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:25.584
with the scenario that we planned on,

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:27.377
because every time
I think of tellin' 'em the truth

01:23:27.461 --> 01:23:29.880
and be like, "Hey, guys,
I got abducted," it's like...

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.966
Again, I still don't even remember
what the hell happened there anyway.

01:23:33.050 --> 01:23:35.928
Finding an artifact that ends up
being an alien test tube baby,

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.554
then me putting a suit on
to make me invisible,

01:23:37.638 --> 01:23:39.264
Jonesy walking between worlds,

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:40.933
- just makes us sound like nutjobs.
- Exactly. Exactly.

01:23:41.016 --> 01:23:43.143
Dude, they're gonna
pull us off of duty for sure.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:46.146
No, we'll just say exactly what we got,
exactly what Thorpe said.

01:23:46.230 --> 01:23:48.941
Right. We found evidence of heavy
engagement with explosives,

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.484
and there was
a downed drone there already.

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:51.944
Exactly, we found an empty lab.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.820
One survivor, research scientist

01:23:53.904 --> 01:23:55.614
that was already there in the lab.

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:58.408
We interrogated her, story checks out,
we gave her over for observation.

01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.452
- And she didn't remember shit.
- Right.

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:22.891
