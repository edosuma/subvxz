00:00.001 --> 00:03.102
So, patrick,
are you saying that
you were an angry baby?

00:03.104 --> 00:06.271
No, I think more of
a sardonic baby.

00:06.273 --> 00:08.207
My first word was,

00:08.209 --> 00:10.209
( flatly )
"really?"

00:10.211 --> 00:12.478
What the hell
does sardonic mean?

00:12.480 --> 00:15.080
( flatly )
really?

00:15.082 --> 00:17.683
Well, we're out of time,
so I will see you all next week.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.488
Lacey, can you
hang back for
a minute?

00:22.490 --> 00:25.324
- What's up?
- Look, I think
you and I both know

00:25.326 --> 00:27.226
That there's something
going on between us

00:27.228 --> 00:28.694
And we need
to talk about it.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.329
Oh, my god.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.231
Are we actually, like,
acknowledging this?

00:32.233 --> 00:36.135
It's wrong,
but there's nothing
I can do about it.

00:36.137 --> 00:39.371
- I want you.
- 'kay.

00:52.752 --> 00:55.788
- You are so amazing.
- I know, right?

00:59.459 --> 01:02.294
What the hell?
Charlie?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.163
Okay, that's it.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.299
No more not drinking
before bed.

01:08.468 --> 01:10.536
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

01:12.472 --> 01:15.274
<i>( knocks on door )</i>

01:15.276 --> 01:17.342
Coming.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.783
- Hey.
- What the hell
are you doing with that?

01:24.785 --> 01:29.588
Good evening, miss.
Is there someone less
aggressive I could talk to?

01:31.125 --> 01:35.794
Yeah, she said that
your vacuum cleaner died,
so I brought you one.

01:35.796 --> 01:37.696
Because she's been
vacuuming the house

01:37.698 --> 01:39.832
For the last seven hours
and wore it out.

01:39.834 --> 01:43.135
Aha!
So it didn't die.

01:44.304 --> 01:48.140
- It was murdered.
- I'm serious, charlie.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.742
Her ocd's acting up.
It's her english class.

01:50.744 --> 01:54.146
Sam's a straight-a student,
but no matter how hard
she works,

01:54.148 --> 01:57.683
She can't get an a
out of this teacher
and it's driving her nuts.

01:57.685 --> 02:00.486
God, I hated english.
I always cut that class.

02:00.488 --> 02:03.522
And those english
teachers with their stupid
vocabulary quizzes.

02:03.524 --> 02:06.825
They were also so-- so...

02:06.827 --> 02:08.894
Why can't I ever find
the right words?

02:10.530 --> 02:11.864
My god.
Thank you so much.

02:11.866 --> 02:13.765
I still have the whole
upstairs to do.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.536
- Did you bring
the extension cord?
- Sam, sam, you're obsessing.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.204
What's going on with
your english teacher?

02:19.206 --> 02:21.140
I don't know what
the woman wants.

02:21.142 --> 02:23.242
Look, you're stuck
in a pattern, okay?

02:23.244 --> 02:25.444
So I want you to go upstairs
and do anything but vacuum.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.346
Fine,
I'll just go upstairs

02:27.348 --> 02:29.648
And start a dangerous
relationship with an
internet predator.

02:30.717 --> 02:33.685
Go for it.
As long as he doesn't
bring you a vacuum.

02:33.687 --> 02:36.255
You've gotta go see
that teacher.

02:36.257 --> 02:38.624
- Okay, when do you wanna go?
- Oh, no. I shouldn't go.

02:38.626 --> 02:41.226
You know me,
when it comes to sam,
I'm too defensive.

02:41.228 --> 02:45.364
Remember when she was 12
and I yelled at that jackass
for calling her short?

02:45.366 --> 02:48.700
That was his job.
You had to be this tall
to get on the roller coaster.

02:51.671 --> 02:55.307
- And, ed,
how was your weekend?
- I got into a fender bender.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.442
The other driver
was elderly

02:57.444 --> 02:59.378
And she was a woman

02:59.380 --> 03:03.182
And, surprise, surprise,
she was an asian.

03:04.217 --> 03:06.185
I hit the trifecta.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.353
What happened?
Did you swerve
to avoid hitting

03:08.355 --> 03:11.323
The sneaky arab
or carload of mexicans?

03:11.325 --> 03:14.326
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- Okay, that's true.

03:14.328 --> 03:16.728
You wouldn't swerve.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.731
All right, we're out
of time, folks. I'll see
you all next week.

03:22.635 --> 03:25.904
- Lacey, can I talk
to you for a second?
- Oh, god. It's happening.

03:28.508 --> 03:31.610
Everything okay?
You spent the whole session
staring at me.

03:31.612 --> 03:35.280
If I didn't know better,
I'd think you were
paying attention.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.682
No, that'd be silly,

03:36.684 --> 03:38.850
But I can't really
talk about it.

03:38.852 --> 03:43.822
You can tell me anything.
You told me that you got high
at your grandmother's funeral.

03:43.824 --> 03:47.359
- Is this worse than that?
- That was 2010, charlie.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.295
Attitudes about drugs
were very different back then.

03:51.497 --> 03:53.932
And, uh, I can't talk
to you about it

03:53.934 --> 03:56.301
Because it's--

03:56.303 --> 04:00.239
Would you feel
more comfortable talking
to a female therapist?

04:00.241 --> 04:03.642
- I could ask kate.
- Yeah, kate would be perfect.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.712
She knows me
and she knows you...

04:06.714 --> 04:08.714
â™ª my nature.

04:14.887 --> 04:18.023
- Miss hippert?
- Oh, you must be
samantha's dad.

04:18.025 --> 04:20.425
So sorry I'm late.
I was gonna shoot you
a text,

04:20.427 --> 04:22.728
But my dog ate the phone.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.898
No?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.268
Go ahead and have a seat.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.770
Yeah, the chairs are
a lot bigger now that
obesity is such a problem.

04:34.641 --> 04:37.409
Listen, I know you're
really busy and I really
appreciate you seeing me.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.011
It's just that
my daughter sam

04:39.013 --> 04:41.647
Is having kind of
a hard time in your class.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.983
Really?
Well, she has a b average.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.452
- A b's a very good grade.
- Oh, I know.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.522
I was one of those jocks
who used to make fun of the guys
who got bs.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.591
In fact, the one time I got a b,
I had to stick my own head

04:52.593 --> 04:55.694
In the toilet
and give myself a swirly.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.629
And your daughter's different.

04:57.631 --> 05:01.633
I get it, but the only time
I give as is for truly
outstanding work.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.469
I understand that
grading essays is subjective,

05:04.471 --> 05:07.439
But if I can go home
with a list of criteria
that sam could work towards

05:07.441 --> 05:09.074
To raise her grade,
that would be great.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.476
Absolutely.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.680
- I'd be happy to.
- Thanks.

05:14.682 --> 05:18.083
It's funny, my ex was afraid
that this is gonna be
very confrontational.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.919
Oh, no.
They always go
really well.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.922
Except for the ones
where the single dads
come in and try to hit on me.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.625
I would never do that.

05:26.627 --> 05:28.694
Yeah.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.832
Eh, do you want me
to do that?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.101
Um, well,
believe me,

05:36.103 --> 05:39.071
Normally I would never even
think about dating a parent,

05:39.073 --> 05:41.106
But in two weeks,

05:41.108 --> 05:43.608
I'm moving to portugal
to teach english,

05:43.610 --> 05:46.778
So it's not
really an issue.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.647
- Portugal?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

05:48.649 --> 05:50.615
So, as long as
we're discreet,

05:50.617 --> 05:53.785
I won't get in trouble
and your daughter won't
get embarrassed.

05:53.787 --> 05:57.456
Fine, if anyone asks,
portugal.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.058
That's our story.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.594
No, I mean,
I really am moving
to portugal.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.964
Oh, yes, you are.
That's what makes this okay.

06:05.966 --> 06:07.833
No, seriously.
It's been a dream of mine

06:07.835 --> 06:10.535
Ever since I studied
portuguese history
in college.

06:10.537 --> 06:13.872
Wow, you have a whole backstory.
That is a serious commitment.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.609
( speaks portuguese )

06:17.611 --> 06:19.711
And you learned
that language. How long
were you waiting for me

06:19.713 --> 06:21.646
To come in here and complain
about my daughter?

06:23.416 --> 06:25.417
Okay, you.

06:25.419 --> 06:28.086
- So when are we
getting together?
- How 'bout tonight?

06:28.088 --> 06:30.989
Oh, gosh. I wish,
but I've got a ton
of papers to grade.

06:30.991 --> 06:32.791
Oh.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.765
Okay, 10 more papers

06:39.767 --> 06:43.635
And then I wanna do
that again.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.670
I gotta tell ya,
you have really set
the bar high

06:45.672 --> 06:48.006
For parent-teacher
conferences.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.713
So it's really awkward
because I'm sitting
there in group

06:54.715 --> 06:57.516
And all I can think about
is seeing charlie naked.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.985
Has anything like that
ever happened to you?

06:59.987 --> 07:02.187
Seeing charlie naked?

07:02.189 --> 07:04.956
No, of course not.
I've never seen
charlie naked.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.426
I mean, having a dream
like that.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.728
Oh, right. Dream.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.597
Well, we all have
strange dreams.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.900
Well, can you at least
hypnotize me

07:14.902 --> 07:18.069
Or give me some kind of drug
that might make them stop?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.539
I'm afraid
it's not that easy.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.607
So there's
no drugs at all?

07:24.110 --> 07:27.212
- No.
- Can you at least
look into it?

07:28.981 --> 07:33.051
No. It's very natural
to have dreams

07:33.053 --> 07:35.454
About someone in a position
of power whom we admire.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.823
Oh, so what you're saying

07:37.825 --> 07:39.958
Is I'm not really
in love with charlie.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.960
No.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.463
I'm talking about
idol worship.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.765
Subconsciously,
you're so impressed

07:46.767 --> 07:49.968
With charlie's insights
that you're imbuing him
with the sexual prowess

07:49.970 --> 07:52.671
That matches what you believe
to be his mental acuity.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.773
Wow.

07:54.775 --> 07:57.175
You are, like,
super smart.

07:59.579 --> 08:03.048
And you are
super observant.

08:03.050 --> 08:05.984
- Thank you.
- Now here's what
you're going to do.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.986
- You're going to keep
a dream journal.
- Uh-huh.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.056
- Because once you gain control
of these fantasies,
- yeah.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.959
- They will no longer
control you.
- Wow.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.961
- <i>Do everything I say...</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

08:17.964 --> 08:20.565
- ...And your life
will be better.
- That's awesome.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.536
Are you gonna say something
after everything I say?

08:24.538 --> 08:27.138
I don't think
I can help it.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.880
Hey, charles.
Wanna play some pool?

08:34.882 --> 08:36.882
Sorry, dude.
I threw my back out.

08:36.884 --> 08:40.218
- Aren't you going out
tonight?
- I wish.

08:40.220 --> 08:41.520
You know it's rough
out there

08:41.522 --> 08:42.888
When a millionaire
tech mogul

08:42.890 --> 08:44.990
Like myself
can't get a date.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.960
What, the thousandaire
real estate agent wasn't
working for ya?

08:48.962 --> 08:52.831
No, that only got me
obtainable-age-appropriate
women.

08:54.033 --> 08:56.067
What about you?
You got something
going on?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.702
Well, yeah.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.305
Yeah, I met someone really hot,
but it's complicated.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.641
If she's hot,
what's so complicated?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.809
I met her at sam's school.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.078
Oh, cool.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.947
What grade?

09:08.949 --> 09:11.116
It's her teacher.

09:11.118 --> 09:14.786
Well, that's a more mature
form of terrible judgment.

09:14.788 --> 09:16.888
I know, but no one's
gonna find out

09:16.890 --> 09:18.924
Because she's moving
to portugal in a week.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.959
Thank god because the woman
is wearing me out.

09:20.961 --> 09:23.828
Every session
is a marathon.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.630
How's the medal ceremony?

09:25.632 --> 09:29.067
It's fantastic.
It just takes forever
to get her to the podium.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.870
Who do you pretend to be
to get women like that?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.872
Navy seal,
president, what?

09:33.874 --> 09:35.607
I just told her
I was sam's father.

09:35.609 --> 09:38.143
Oh, I'll try it,
but I don't have
high hopes.

09:39.812 --> 09:42.814
Look, just make sure
that you are good in bed.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.616
Sam's grades
might depend on it.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.618
What the hell
are you talking about?

09:46.620 --> 09:48.653
You know what?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.855
I used to date
my female karate
instructor,

09:50.857 --> 09:52.691
But I never got
my black belt.

09:52.693 --> 09:56.094
You know why?
Because I was
terrible in bed.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.029
In my defense,
she'd spend the
previous half hour

09:58.031 --> 09:59.965
Trying to kick me
in the balls,

09:59.967 --> 10:02.200
So I was
a little flinchy.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.102
That's just stupid.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.938
There's no way that
my performance in bed
is gonna affect sam's grades.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.307
So the teacher hasn't
made any comments?

10:09.309 --> 10:11.042
Well, yeah.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.677
I mean, last night,
she made a joke about me

10:12.679 --> 10:14.379
Doing b-plus work,
but so what?

10:14.381 --> 10:16.648
That wasn't a joke.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.051
- Hey, dad.
- Hey, sweetie.

10:20.053 --> 10:26.057
- What's the matter?
- I worked so hard on this essay
and I only got a b-plus.

10:26.059 --> 10:28.660
Huh, b-plus, eh?

10:31.097 --> 10:34.165
Started out strong,
but left me wanting more.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.937
You were supposed
to talk to her teacher.
Did you go down there?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.239
Yeah, charles.
Did you go down there?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.141
Of course
I went down there.

10:43.143 --> 10:47.078
- How many times?
- Just the once, but I was
very thorough.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.080
So you really
gave it to her?

10:49.082 --> 10:51.983
Oh, yeah.
You should've seen me.
You would've been proud of me.

10:51.985 --> 10:55.820
Look, sam. Miss hippert's
obviously a tough teacher,

10:55.822 --> 10:59.057
But you keep pushing,
I bet she'll finally
give up that a.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.760
Well, I think
that about covers it.

11:03.362 --> 11:06.231
Sam, I need to go over
some stuff with dad.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.366
Can you give us
a minute?

11:08.368 --> 11:11.002
Sam, we love
how driven you are,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.038
But if you ever failed,
you know it's not the end
of the world.

11:13.040 --> 11:15.874
That's the worst advice
you've ever given me, dad.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.275
That's not true.

11:17.277 --> 11:19.310
I told you to take
ballet $5,000 ago.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.384
Man.

11:26.386 --> 11:29.054
Her ocd
is kicking in
big time.

11:29.056 --> 11:31.456
I found a dustbuster
in her backpack.

11:31.458 --> 11:35.093
She says it's not hers,
but every night she locks
her bedroom door

11:35.095 --> 11:37.862
And I know she's in there
vacuuming the rug.

11:37.864 --> 11:40.865
What are you saying,
that our daughter's
doing rugs?

11:42.068 --> 11:44.369
Yeah, charlie.
Your daughter has
a rug problem.

11:45.471 --> 11:48.106
I mean,
I gotta tell you,
she's a mess.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.475
I don't know what
it's gonna take to
get her to get an a.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.045
I don't either.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.385
( panting )
so... Did I...
Do good...

12:00.387 --> 12:03.354
Miss hippert?

12:03.356 --> 12:06.825
"well," charlie.
You did well.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.328
Sorry I took so long.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.063
Are you kidding?
It was great.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.165
As long as the phone call
I had to make in the middle

12:14.167 --> 12:16.000
And cancel an appointment
didn't bother you.

12:16.002 --> 12:19.037
You were like a man
on a mission tonight.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.106
Well, I just wanted
to make sure I aced
that one.

12:23.309 --> 12:26.377
You're really getting off
on this whole student-teacher
thing, aren't you?

12:26.379 --> 12:29.013
Yeah, playing games is fun.

12:29.015 --> 12:31.483
I think I did pretty well
on the test.

12:31.485 --> 12:35.253
There was some stuff in
the middle I was guessing on,
but I think I still got an a.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.289
You're just going to
have to wait for your
report card, young man.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.930
Are you feeling
what I'm feeling?

12:45.932 --> 12:49.100
I don't know. Are you feeling
like you did permanent ligament
damage to one of your fingers?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.971
I mean, about us.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.975
Yeah, it's a shame
that you have to go away
in a few days.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.877
( strained )
I think we really
have something here.

12:58.879 --> 13:02.247
That's what
I was thinking, too.

13:02.249 --> 13:05.016
So I cancelled my plans
for portugal.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.952
- Excuse me?
- I'm staying.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.954
But-- but--
but you can't.

13:09.956 --> 13:13.358
It'll be a disaster...
For the children
of portugal.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.927
They can wait.

13:15.929 --> 13:19.130
Do you know how hard it is
to find a guy as patient
and as generous as you?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.065
Do you know how hard
it is to find someone
who can translate

13:21.067 --> 13:23.434
"oliver twist"
into portuguese?

13:23.436 --> 13:27.405
"please, sir.
May I have some <i>mÃ¡s,</i>
<i>por favor?"</i>

13:27.407 --> 13:30.008
I know this is
kind of a surprise,

13:30.010 --> 13:32.544
But we'll be fine
as long as we're discreet.

13:32.546 --> 13:34.913
You're okay
with this, right?

13:34.915 --> 13:37.115
Okay with you being
sam's teacher for the rest
of the year?

13:37.117 --> 13:39.384
Yeah, and next year, too.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.287
They're moving me
to the 10th grade.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.589
Wouldn't it be crazy
if I was sam's teacher
for all four years?

13:44.591 --> 13:47.125
- ( laughs )
- ( laughs, groans )

13:50.029 --> 13:53.965
So, looking back over
your journal, have you noticed
any patterns in your dreams?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.900
Well, there is one thing.

13:55.902 --> 13:59.003
In all of them,
everything will be
going along super normal,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.972
And then out of nowhere,

14:00.974 --> 14:04.108
Someone will say something
really sexual.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.477
I can see your panties.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.247
Yeah, just like that.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.116
No, really.
I can see your panties.

14:12.118 --> 14:14.252
Oh, I'm so sorry.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.921
Don't apologize.

14:16.923 --> 14:18.990
I like it.

14:18.992 --> 14:21.392
It's happening.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.531
You are so hot.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.900
I know, right?

14:28.902 --> 14:30.935
So, we gonna do this?

14:30.937 --> 14:33.004
Sure, why not?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.609
Okay, seriously?

14:37.611 --> 14:40.311
What the hell
is going on with me?

14:40.313 --> 14:43.081
And where did kate
get those shoes?

14:47.419 --> 14:49.487
Coming.

14:50.522 --> 14:54.158
- Jen, we have to talk.
- What's wrong?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.995
Okay, how do I put this
without freaking you out?

14:56.997 --> 14:59.030
You know that thing

14:59.032 --> 15:01.065
Where you're not supposed to
sleep with your kid's teacher?

15:02.502 --> 15:06.571
She promised she'd have sex
with me and then leave
the country.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.940
I've been looking for
that deal my whole life.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.010
- You're disgusting.
- And I'm exhausted.

15:13.445 --> 15:15.480
Do you have any idea
what it's like to have sex
with this woman?

15:15.482 --> 15:20.118
Who's the greek guy
who kept trying to push
that giant rock up the hill?

15:20.120 --> 15:22.487
Syphilis.

15:22.489 --> 15:25.323
Dear god, I hope not.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.225
Why, charlie?

15:27.227 --> 15:30.194
With sam's teacher?
What were you thinking?

15:30.196 --> 15:33.564
Okay, okay. I know it was a bad
call, but I figured, two weeks,
what could go wrong?

15:33.566 --> 15:37.435
And how was I supposed to know
she'd be linking sam's grades
to my sexual performance?

15:37.437 --> 15:39.570
Oh, there's no way
she's doing that.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.940
I know it sounds crazy,
but she is.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.476
( sighs )
how did you get yourself
into this situation?

15:45.478 --> 15:49.113
- You're such a moron.
- I know.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.215
But don't worry,
I'm gonna break up
with her.

15:51.217 --> 15:53.484
- Oh, no, you're not.
- What?

15:53.486 --> 15:57.055
Sam's ocd's getting worse.
She's driving me crazy.

15:57.057 --> 16:01.025
You're gonna keep sleeping
with this woman until
sam gets an a.

16:01.027 --> 16:02.961
You're not
my wife anymore.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.029
You can't just run around
forcing me to sleep
with people.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.031
I'm serious, charlie.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.733
If she's petty enough
to grade you in bed,

16:08.735 --> 16:11.669
She's petty enough
to take it out on sam
if you break up with her.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.972
All right, fine.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.074
My-- my back
is messed up,

16:16.076 --> 16:18.710
My jaw's killing me,
and I'm pretty sure that
three of my tattoos

16:18.712 --> 16:21.012
Are starting to rub off.

16:21.014 --> 16:23.381
Oh, and by the way,
b-plus?

16:23.383 --> 16:25.750
You're gonna have to
step it up, mister.

16:27.119 --> 16:28.987
For god's sakes, woman.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.356
I don't know what else there
is to do with a penis.

16:31.358 --> 16:34.125
Years ago, I said
the exact same thing to you,

16:34.127 --> 16:36.761
And I'm gonna tell you
what you told me.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.030
"baby, keep trying."

16:43.268 --> 16:45.136
Hey, charlie.

16:45.138 --> 16:48.172
I know your teacher's
coming over, but you got
a couple of eggs?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.608
- I'm making a cake.
- A cake?

16:50.610 --> 16:54.345
- If you wanna see what
she looks like, just say so.
- I'm not that desperate.

16:54.347 --> 16:58.649
All right, fine.
You're making a cake.

17:02.521 --> 17:05.289
( whistles )

17:05.291 --> 17:07.425
- Here you go.
- What are those for?

17:08.627 --> 17:11.729
- The cake.
- Oh, right.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.701
- She's not gonna be here
for another hour.
- Damn it.

17:19.171 --> 17:20.605
<i>( cell phone chimes )</i>

17:20.607 --> 17:22.774
Oh, that's impossible.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.510
- What happened?
- Sam got a d.

17:25.512 --> 17:29.180
That stupid teacher
gave me a d.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.383
I'm screwing my daughter
into a community college.

17:36.688 --> 17:38.756
<i>( knocking on door )</i>

17:42.661 --> 17:44.629
Charlie?

17:44.631 --> 17:46.197
Charlie?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.500
Oh, hey. Come in.
Come in.

17:49.502 --> 17:51.702
Sorry,
I was just vacuuming.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.105
I don't know why.

17:54.107 --> 17:57.442
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.278
Actually, no.
I need to ask you
a question.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.747
Am I satisfying you?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.816
What do you mean?

18:06.418 --> 18:08.853
Look, I understand
that sex is objective,

18:08.855 --> 18:11.122
But if you could give me
a list of criteria to work on

18:11.124 --> 18:14.192
To raise my grade,
that would be awesome.

18:14.194 --> 18:17.361
You're doing great.
Gold star for charlie.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.232
- Then why did sam get a d?
- What?

18:21.234 --> 18:24.335
Oh, come on.
We both know that
you're giving sam bad grades

18:24.337 --> 18:26.270
Based on something--
god knows what--

18:26.272 --> 18:28.172
That I'm not doing
for you in bed.

18:28.174 --> 18:31.509
What kind of twisted person
do you think I am?

18:31.511 --> 18:34.545
Obviously, if I knew,
I'd be getting an a.

18:34.547 --> 18:38.182
- You're insane.
- Am I?

18:38.184 --> 18:41.352
What about the b-plus
you gave sam the morning after
you said I was a b-plus in bed?

18:41.354 --> 18:43.287
Well,
that was a coincidence.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.890
You both did above average,
but not excellent work.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.228
Oh, come on.
My kid's never got a c
in her life, let alone a d.

18:50.230 --> 18:53.164
- Have you read her essay?
- I don't have to. I know
what my kid's capable of.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.199
Well, I brought it with me
to discuss with you

18:55.201 --> 18:57.201
Because I was
concerned about it.

18:57.203 --> 18:59.337
Read it.

18:59.339 --> 19:02.173
"'a long day's journey
into night'

19:02.175 --> 19:04.242
Is a play about a journey,

19:04.244 --> 19:06.210
A very important journey

19:06.212 --> 19:09.447
That goes so long
it eventually turns into...

19:09.449 --> 19:12.316
Night."

19:12.318 --> 19:14.352
That's a d paper, charlie.

19:14.354 --> 19:18.189
I don't understand.
Why would sam write
a paper like this?

19:18.191 --> 19:19.790
Yeah, that's what
I was gonna ask you

19:19.792 --> 19:22.527
Before you started
accusing me of having
absolutely no morals.

19:22.529 --> 19:26.497
Oh, my god.
I feel like
such an idiot.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.433
Of course I didn't get a d.

19:30.769 --> 19:34.672
- Good-bye, charlie.
- I'm-- I'm sorry.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.741
If I did get a grade,
what would it be?

19:38.243 --> 19:39.877
<i>( car starts )</i>

19:39.879 --> 19:42.680
If it's an a,
just ignore me and drive home.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.384
Yes.

19:48.387 --> 19:50.488
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.257
- Can we talk for a minute?
- Sure.

19:53.259 --> 19:57.195
Listen, I spoke to your teacher
yesterday about your essay.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.630
I'm gonna ask you one question
and I want an honest answer.

19:59.632 --> 20:01.499
Okay.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.602
Did you let your mom
write your paper for you?

20:04.604 --> 20:07.305
No. I wrote it.

20:07.307 --> 20:11.676
- Wasn't it horrible?
- Any essay that ends with
"peace out" is horrible.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.280
- Why would you do that?
- I was thinking about
what you said.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.416
That I need to let go
of my need to be perfect,

20:18.418 --> 20:21.519
So I thought for
this one paper,
I would tank it.

20:21.521 --> 20:24.255
Well, that's fantastic.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.823
I'm so proud of you.
Congratulations.

20:25.825 --> 20:28.826
Thank you.
Carter mcgary
got an a on it,

20:28.828 --> 20:32.296
But rumor has it
his dad's sleeping
with miss hippert.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.266
Well, good luck to him.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.239
You see, dreams like this
aren't really about sex.

20:41.241 --> 20:43.741
- They're about power.
- I agree.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.610
It doesn't matter
who the person is.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.378
It's an authority figure--

20:47.380 --> 20:49.981
Your subconscious
is drawn to them.

20:49.983 --> 20:53.251
So what you're saying is
I not only have anger issues

20:53.253 --> 20:56.320
With authority,
I also wanna please.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.489
Exactly.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.791
Okay, so now that
I know about it,

21:00.793 --> 21:03.527
I won't have any more
of these crazy dreams.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.329
Not so fast.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.600
You still got some daddy issues
to work through.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.669
Scoot over.
