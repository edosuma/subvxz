"Brockmire".

00:04.471 --> 00:08.295
New season, Wednesdays
at 10, starts April 3rd on IFC.

00:12.164 --> 00:14.947
Boy, have I had trouble
sleeping lately.

00:14.983 --> 00:17.296
My sober mind,
it just races through

00:17.332 --> 00:19.987
all the clarity
and the silence.

00:22.741 --> 00:24.539
Brockmire,

00:24.575 --> 00:26.734
really finding
his rhythm now.

00:26.770 --> 00:28.854
Masturbation, my best defense

00:28.890 --> 00:31.372
against the seemingly
endless nights.

00:31.408 --> 00:33.534
Bye, bye, birdie.

00:33.570 --> 00:36.474
Carnal knowledge.

00:36.510 --> 00:39.676
Oh, "Newsies"!

00:39.712 --> 00:40.589
When that wore off,

00:40.625 --> 00:43.435
I tried to exhaust myself
with hobbies.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.925
Ah, yeah.

00:51.961 --> 00:54.452
And you can be
right next to Howard.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.794
But that turned tedious,

00:55.830 --> 00:57.643
so I went back
to masturbation.

01:03.538 --> 01:05.890
Oh, Christmas is coming!

01:08.244 --> 01:11.197
Hoo, Merry Christmas,
everybody.

01:11.233 --> 01:13.628
Merry Christmas.

01:15.087 --> 01:17.812
Help.

01:17.848 --> 01:20.250
And that's when I started
hearing the voice.

01:20.286 --> 01:22.455
Help.

01:25.287 --> 01:26.690
- Help.
- It was monotone,

01:26.726 --> 01:28.911
but, God, it was unrelenting.

01:28.947 --> 01:30.348
- Help.
- And then it happened again

01:30.384 --> 01:31.406
the next night.

01:31.442 --> 01:33.777
Help.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.061
- And the night after that.
- Help.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.918
- Help. Help.
- And the night after that.

01:40.954 --> 01:41.933
No matter where I looked,

01:41.969 --> 01:44.459
I just... I couldn't find
the source.

01:44.495 --> 01:47.138
Help.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.256
Help.

01:51.787 --> 01:53.594
Help.

01:53.630 --> 01:56.514
Help. Help.
Help.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.774
There was only
one explanation.

01:58.810 --> 02:02.941
I was chasing a voice inside
my own head.

02:02.977 --> 02:05.801
But what the hell was I
trying to tell myself?

02:05.837 --> 02:07.401
I mean, I didn't know whether
I was supposed to

02:07.437 --> 02:10.607
help the world or my friends
or myself.

02:10.643 --> 02:12.160
So I just got down
on my knees

02:12.196 --> 02:16.635
and I said a prayer
to all three.

02:16.671 --> 02:22.625
And I just sank into serenity
like a warm bath.

02:22.661 --> 02:25.378
Quick footnote to that story,

02:25.414 --> 02:27.756
turns out I wasn't the voice
at all.

02:27.792 --> 02:30.634
That was the voice of my
86-year-old neighbor, Eunice.

02:30.670 --> 02:32.678
See, my super explained to me
that Eunice

02:32.714 --> 02:36.766
has 24-hour in-home care,
except for a 5-minute gap

02:36.802 --> 02:39.518
due to the bus schedules
of both of her nurses.

02:39.554 --> 02:41.501
And she just screams
her head off

02:41.537 --> 02:44.341
throughout that entire
five minutes. Ha.

02:44.377 --> 02:46.957
Yeah, then my super
offered me some Oxy.

02:46.993 --> 02:48.521
Even for Florida,

02:48.557 --> 02:50.546
the whole thing
was extremely Florida.

02:50.582 --> 02:52.818
Any hoodles, that's my share,

02:52.854 --> 02:55.488
so don't forget to tip
that donation box, people.

02:55.524 --> 02:56.852
God bless, you.

02:56.888 --> 02:58.304
So long.

02:59.929 --> 03:02.293
You're supposed to listen
to the other people speak.

03:02.329 --> 03:04.671
I know. I'm running out
to a work thing.

03:04.707 --> 03:06.215
Maybe.

03:06.251 --> 03:09.435
That's not why
you're leaving.

03:09.512 --> 03:10.769
How you doing there?

03:10.805 --> 03:12.768
- My name's Jim Brockmire.
- I know who you are.

03:12.804 --> 03:14.481
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

03:14.517 --> 03:18.694
Is that a positive or a
negative for me in this moment?

03:18.730 --> 03:20.112
It's a lot of both.

03:20.148 --> 03:22.157
Well, that seems to be
the general consensus.

03:22.193 --> 03:23.986
Look, despite what
you might think,

03:24.045 --> 03:26.147
I take my sobriety
very seriously.

03:26.234 --> 03:29.724
I'm looking for a sponsor while
I'm here for spring training.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.350
So...

03:31.386 --> 03:34.093
Are you interested or what?

03:34.173 --> 03:35.313
I'll be your sponsor,

03:35.349 --> 03:38.733
if you tell the truth about
the end of your share.

03:38.769 --> 03:40.995
I did tell you the truth
about the end of my share.

03:41.031 --> 03:45.315
There was a woman crying out
for help, scared and alone.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.859
What did you do about it?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.611
I soundproofed
the townhouse.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.530
Now I'll be your sponsor.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.073
How'd you know that was true?

03:53.109 --> 03:56.661
Truth always sounds awful
when you hear it out loud.

03:56.697 --> 03:58.194
Ah.

03:58.232 --> 04:00.734
Ain't that the truth?

04:01.217 --> 04:03.475
Jesus, this Florida humidity.

04:03.694 --> 04:05.947
Gene Kelly is swinging
an umbrella

04:05.983 --> 04:08.423
all up in my swamp ass.

04:10.000 --> 04:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:20.233 --> 04:21.950
Okay.

04:22.288 --> 04:24.308
As some of you may have
already heard,

04:24.467 --> 04:26.776
I'm about to head on to
the DL for a little while.

04:26.812 --> 04:28.778
- Kick cancer's ass, Bat!
- Yeah!

04:28.814 --> 04:31.157
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
doesn't know what it's in for!

04:31.193 --> 04:34.487
Thanks, fellas.
The, uh, outpouring of support

04:34.523 --> 04:37.580
from everybody,
especially the fans,

04:37.616 --> 04:40.416
has been truly special.
So while I'm laid up,

04:40.452 --> 04:42.371
holding things down
on the radio side

04:42.407 --> 04:44.253
will be these two superstars.

04:44.301 --> 04:46.571
First up, two-time NCAA

04:46.607 --> 04:49.251
champion softball legend,
Gabby Taylor.

04:49.287 --> 04:51.544
Thank you.
It is an honor and a privilege

04:51.580 --> 04:53.296
to be sharing the stage
with you today, Bat.

04:53.332 --> 04:56.780
And joining Gabby in the
booth will be Jim Brockmire.

04:56.816 --> 05:00.129
Jim, you wanna have your public
meltdown now or later?

05:00.180 --> 05:01.588
Oh, well.

05:01.625 --> 05:04.141
Yeah, my... at this point
in my last press conference,

05:04.177 --> 05:06.282
I'd been tazed and stripped
down naked,

05:06.318 --> 05:09.856
so this is already
a tremendous win for me.

05:13.739 --> 05:15.498
But in all seriousness,

05:15.553 --> 05:19.064
I'm so grateful to be back
around the game I love so much.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.928
It's been
a very long road back.

05:20.964 --> 05:24.955
I have been truly humbled both
personally and professionally

05:25.193 --> 05:27.875
and, well, I'm here to tell you
that I arrived here

05:27.911 --> 05:29.210
a very different man.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.589
What kind of a joyless golem
serves soup in a green room?

05:32.728 --> 05:35.415
Are they requesting that we
eat it out of a cup,

05:35.510 --> 05:38.156
out of some kind of failed
attempt at shabby chic?

05:38.192 --> 05:40.939
Nope, helter-skelter,
forgot the bowls. Hey!

05:40.975 --> 05:42.320
Just don't eat the soup.

05:45.911 --> 05:48.142
Jesus. Look at this shit.

05:48.178 --> 05:50.616
It's like a goddamn
public school cafeteria.

05:50.652 --> 05:52.633
- Right?
- Hey, Bat, if you're hungry,

05:52.669 --> 05:53.938
I'd love to
take you out to lunch,

05:53.974 --> 05:56.899
maybe pick your
broadcasting brain?

05:57.177 --> 05:58.851
Yeah, I'm gonna pass
on lunch.

05:58.887 --> 06:01.687
No problem, yeah, you could
probably use the downtime.

06:01.723 --> 06:05.882
Actually, my aunt recently
battled breast cancer.

06:05.918 --> 06:08.509
I look like I have breasts?

06:08.593 --> 06:09.839
No.

06:09.875 --> 06:11.792
No, you look like you're
entirely made out of muscle,

06:11.828 --> 06:15.373
just like a human tendon,
you know?

06:19.860 --> 06:21.959
Uh, don't let the cancer
fool you.

06:21.995 --> 06:22.845
He's an asshole.

06:22.881 --> 06:25.326
Has to make everybody
around him feel small.

06:25.362 --> 06:27.832
It's part of his whole
Matt the Bat shenanigans.

06:27.880 --> 06:28.447
His nickname?

06:28.483 --> 06:29.932
He got that from being
a good hitter.

06:29.968 --> 06:32.059
Oh, no, he was
a "Punch and Judy" infielder

06:32.095 --> 06:33.630
whose glove kept him
in the game.

06:33.666 --> 06:37.563
No, the derivation of
Matt the Bat comes from, uh...

06:37.599 --> 06:40.817
his locker room presence.

06:41.141 --> 06:43.044
He's got the biggest dick
in baseball history.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.986
- Whoa, seriously?
- Oh, yeah.

06:45.022 --> 06:47.340
Matt loves all
that alpha male bullshit.

06:47.376 --> 06:49.731
He likes bump into you
accidentally on purpose

06:49.767 --> 06:50.919
to make an impression.

06:50.955 --> 06:53.751
Literally. Left a dent.

06:53.787 --> 06:55.246
There's a density to it, Gabby.

06:55.282 --> 06:59.333
It's like a wind sock that's
been packed with wet sand.

06:59.369 --> 07:02.435
Any hoodles, that's where the
name Matt the Bat comes from.

07:02.471 --> 07:05.422
Also, he's the worst.
I mean, the worst,

07:05.458 --> 07:07.491
and despite what you might have
heard about me...

07:07.527 --> 07:09.396
No, I'm not.

07:09.432 --> 07:11.601
I wanna assure you,
sobriety has changed me.

07:11.637 --> 07:15.559
Okay, really. I am no longer
that reckless say-anything Jim.

07:15.595 --> 07:16.732
You just spent
the last two minutes

07:16.768 --> 07:20.319
going into aggressive detail
about our coworker's dick.

07:20.601 --> 07:22.061
Oh, shit, I did do that,
didn't I?

07:22.097 --> 07:23.059
God damn it, I am just...

07:23.095 --> 07:26.729
I am not built for
the 21st century workplace.

07:26.906 --> 07:29.910
Are we still on for lunch,
because...

07:34.081 --> 07:34.856
Can we just talk about

07:34.892 --> 07:36.748
the dick thing again
for one moment?

07:36.784 --> 07:38.792
- Oh, my God. Why?
- Well, I want to apologize.

07:38.828 --> 07:41.935
I wanna assure you I am no
Louie C.K. or Charlie Rose.

07:41.982 --> 07:45.467
Although, I did once role play
as John Lasseter

07:45.503 --> 07:47.260
at a Pixar-themed orgy
one time

07:47.296 --> 07:48.378
but, you know,
I've always practiced...

07:48.414 --> 07:50.763
- Hello!
- Oh, hey, friend.

07:50.799 --> 07:53.562
Here you go. This thing's
getting mighty stinky.

07:53.648 --> 07:54.963
Oh, no, no, no.

07:54.999 --> 07:57.799
I'm your producer, Gus Barton.
How are you?

07:57.944 --> 07:59.493
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

07:59.529 --> 08:01.620
- Gus Barton.
- Hi.

08:01.895 --> 08:04.869
Do you mind if I ask you
your qualifications, sir?

08:04.905 --> 08:06.328
I don't mind at all.

08:06.364 --> 08:08.136
Worked for the Montreal Expos.

08:08.172 --> 08:09.991
The Expos left in 2004.

08:10.058 --> 08:10.927
Yup.

08:10.963 --> 08:13.473
So I spent the last 15 years
living in Montreal

08:13.509 --> 08:17.144
raising three kids while
my wife taught at McGill.

08:17.270 --> 08:19.529
The soup foretold
all of this.

08:19.565 --> 08:22.421
So my wife jokes
that I'd be the perfect guy

08:22.457 --> 08:25.186
to produce a career killer
like Jim Brockmire,

08:25.222 --> 08:27.620
because my career
is already dead.

08:27.656 --> 08:28.375
Mmm.

08:28.411 --> 08:30.642
She's got a very dark
sense of humor.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.001
I think that's what
cost her her tenure.

08:33.037 --> 08:35.602
2014 was a tough year.

08:35.639 --> 08:37.631
Nobody thinks that
I'm a career killer.

08:37.667 --> 08:38.793
That's the first thing
my agent said

08:38.828 --> 08:41.207
when he called to tell me
we were paired together.

08:42.067 --> 08:45.492
One, two, three, four,

08:45.759 --> 08:49.561
five, six, count me,
that's seven, eight.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.271
Yeah, no,
that's a lot of careers. Okay.

08:51.307 --> 08:52.772
- Ohh...
- No, no, no, no,

08:52.827 --> 08:55.971
this is when I do
a daily moral inventory.

08:56.007 --> 08:58.557
All right, note to self.

08:58.797 --> 09:05.018
"Stop killing
people's careers."

09:05.340 --> 09:06.869
Boom. Problem solved.

09:06.905 --> 09:09.291
Thank you for inviting me
to the broadcaster's dinner.

09:09.327 --> 09:11.279
- Sure.
- I drove past it twice.

09:11.315 --> 09:12.221
I didn't think
a nice restaurant

09:12.257 --> 09:14.671
would be in such
a run-down strip mall.

09:14.707 --> 09:17.237
All of Central Florida's
a run-down strip mall.

09:17.273 --> 09:19.653
This complex alone
is a Pentecostal church,

09:19.689 --> 09:22.220
a gun shop,
and a Jersey Mike's.

09:22.256 --> 09:24.036
Here they are.

09:24.072 --> 09:25.454
Hey, boys.

09:25.685 --> 09:27.698
Ah, hmm, looks like
we're gonna need

09:27.804 --> 09:29.604
one more chair here,
my friend.

09:29.640 --> 09:30.911
No, no, no,
don't bother with that.

09:30.947 --> 09:33.609
We don't have room.

09:33.645 --> 09:35.899
Right, well,
message received.

09:35.935 --> 09:37.596
Oh, no, no, no,
this is some

09:37.632 --> 09:39.742
industrial-grade bullshit
right here.

09:39.817 --> 09:42.107
Look, I sympathize with you,
I do.

09:42.170 --> 09:44.579
All the things you consider
to be good, clean fun

09:44.615 --> 09:46.546
are now considered to be
mean and sexist,

09:46.582 --> 09:48.766
but, you know, that's just
'cause they are.

09:48.802 --> 09:50.835
The chair is for Gabby.

09:50.871 --> 09:53.967
- Oh.
- She's a ball player.

09:54.003 --> 09:55.674
Well, I don't understand.

09:55.710 --> 09:58.636
Well, we don't like you,
Brockmire.

09:58.672 --> 10:00.880
- Oh.
- At your very best,

10:00.916 --> 10:02.948
you are like a circus bear

10:02.984 --> 10:05.642
who would stumble around
for the crowd to laugh at.

10:05.721 --> 10:08.353
- Ho ho hoo.
- Now, when they trot you out,

10:08.452 --> 10:10.861
it is just sad.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.111
Somebody should have
taken you behind the tent

10:13.147 --> 10:14.878
and shot you years ago.

10:14.914 --> 10:16.546
Well, well, well...

10:19.611 --> 10:21.746
- Jim, are you okay?
- No, please, I'm fine.

10:21.826 --> 10:23.448
Just... I'm a little more
emotional these days

10:23.484 --> 10:25.795
- than I used to be.
- You stay.

10:26.107 --> 10:28.188
I'll grab a bite
at the Jersey Mike's.

10:28.224 --> 10:30.013
Maybe swing by
the Pentecostal church,

10:30.049 --> 10:33.225
watch a little snake handling
to go along with my

10:33.376 --> 10:36.546
aggressively oily sammie.

10:47.925 --> 10:50.386
What the shit!

10:51.048 --> 10:53.040
Well, don't just let that
hang out in my house.

10:53.076 --> 10:54.566
Kill it. Shoot it.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.211
I don't carry a gun.

10:56.247 --> 10:58.172
Isn't that the
whole point of Florida?

10:58.311 --> 11:00.486
Hey,
I didn't get into this job

11:00.522 --> 11:02.613
to kill defenseless animals,
all right?

11:02.649 --> 11:04.173
I did it to kill gators.

11:04.209 --> 11:07.761
But I'm not harming that poor,
defenseless tortoise.

11:07.797 --> 11:09.564
That big guy hibernates
in the winter.

11:09.619 --> 11:11.186
Now, I'm guessing they turned
the heat on a few days early...

11:11.222 --> 11:12.790
I'm sure his life
has all the complexity

11:12.826 --> 11:14.315
of a Russian novel, all right?

11:14.351 --> 11:16.263
Can you please just get it
the hell out of here?

11:16.299 --> 11:18.238
Look, it's coming at us.

11:18.294 --> 11:20.658
It's an elderly animal.
No one's gonna adopt it.

11:20.714 --> 11:21.848
Betty White
is an elderly animal.

11:21.884 --> 11:26.414
That is a boring monster
who smells like dead, wet dog.

11:26.450 --> 11:28.672
If I take him,
it's a death sentence.

11:28.708 --> 11:30.299
Okay.

11:30.625 --> 11:33.127
I'm good with that.

11:34.625 --> 11:38.170
It's probably for the best.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.849
Darwin.

11:42.393 --> 11:45.611
There you go.

11:45.846 --> 11:47.890
Ugh!

11:57.409 --> 11:59.458
- What's in the folder?
- Research.

11:59.494 --> 12:01.419
Fun facts
for the big broadcast.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.254
God, I love the public library.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.129
It's America's greatest
institution.

12:05.165 --> 12:06.958
Yeah, the last time I was
in a public library

12:06.994 --> 12:09.252
I saw three different homeless
people masturbating.

12:09.288 --> 12:11.755
Yeah, not a great time
for American institutions.

12:11.791 --> 12:13.822
- No. I got you something.
- Oh.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.040
In softball, the entire team
always wears something

12:16.076 --> 12:18.457
on opening day
as a sign of unity.

12:18.493 --> 12:20.611
The best team I was ever on
did this tour through China

12:20.647 --> 12:22.850
where I got these pins.

12:22.886 --> 12:24.055
I thought we could wear them.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.520
Oh, that's so sweet
and thoughtful.

12:26.556 --> 12:27.356
Thank you.

12:27.392 --> 12:28.963
So what, you wear one,
I wear one,

12:28.999 --> 12:30.859
and then we put one
on the desk to like

12:30.895 --> 12:32.152
represent the audience?

12:32.188 --> 12:33.643
No, the third pin
is for Gus.

12:33.679 --> 12:35.475
Oh, gross. No.
Come on. No.

12:35.511 --> 12:37.434
He's not part of the team.
We're the talent.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.298
You don't give Gus a gift
for the same reason

12:39.334 --> 12:41.074
you don't feed a dog
from the table.

12:41.153 --> 12:42.997
Very important that he always
knows his place.

12:43.033 --> 12:43.901
What an asshole.

12:43.937 --> 12:45.862
Oh, man, he's just the worst,
isn't he?

12:45.898 --> 12:47.807
- Not him. You.
- Right.

12:47.843 --> 12:50.772
My philosophy
about broadcasting is

12:50.860 --> 12:52.475
you don't sweat
the small stuff.

12:52.525 --> 12:54.192
- And you know what?
- Ooh, don't say it.

12:54.228 --> 12:56.341
It's all small stuff.

12:56.377 --> 12:58.886
And you wanted
to give him a pin.

12:58.922 --> 13:01.764
You see, we are
the part-time radio crew

13:02.028 --> 13:04.539
of the cheapest organization
in baseball.

13:04.575 --> 13:08.389
So enjoy the view from the
bottom of the broadcast barrel.

13:08.425 --> 13:11.463
- Relax, put on your headphones...
- Don't do headphones.

13:11.516 --> 13:13.107
Can't stand the sound
of my own voice.

13:13.143 --> 13:14.813
Really?
Now, see, I assumed you

13:14.849 --> 13:16.366
masturbated to your own voice.

13:16.402 --> 13:18.359
My real voice, sure,
but no headphone

13:18.395 --> 13:20.709
can capture the complex bourbon
and butter flavor

13:20.745 --> 13:22.086
of my actual timbre.

13:22.122 --> 13:24.886
Jim, I get the impression

13:24.980 --> 13:27.489
that you don't respect me
as a producer.

13:27.581 --> 13:28.984
Well, Gus, I'm so sorry.

13:29.020 --> 13:30.819
I did not mean to give you
that impression.

13:30.855 --> 13:32.404
I should have been more clear.

13:32.595 --> 13:36.688
I 100% don't respect you
as a producer or as a man.

13:36.724 --> 13:39.941
Gus, I guess I don't respect
you in totality.

13:39.977 --> 13:42.068
Fine, one man's opinion.

13:42.104 --> 13:43.992
How about you, Gabby, huh?

13:44.028 --> 13:46.411
What do you think?

13:46.501 --> 13:49.099
Really?
How come?

13:49.273 --> 13:50.388
Well, it starts with
the overalls

13:50.463 --> 13:52.262
and then it just kind of
branches out from there.

13:52.298 --> 13:57.795
Overalls allow me to fully
experience the freedom of life

13:57.831 --> 13:59.564
without undergarments.

13:59.610 --> 14:00.942
- Ohh...
- And you guys,

14:00.978 --> 14:05.652
you voluntarily wear
the 100% cotton chastity belts,

14:05.707 --> 14:07.722
and I'm the weirdo, huh?

14:07.865 --> 14:12.018
All right, Jim, you don't wear
headphones, fine.

14:12.054 --> 14:14.089
I'll just poke you with
a big stick

14:14.177 --> 14:15.939
whenever I need to tell you
something.

14:15.975 --> 14:18.567
Okay, headphones.
Let's see.

14:18.603 --> 14:20.069
Testing, one, two.
Testing.

14:20.132 --> 14:24.139
Folks. Folks, that ball is
Maria-Conchita-a-gone-zo.

14:24.175 --> 14:25.241
Well, these thing's are broken

14:25.277 --> 14:28.989
because my voice sounds
ridiculous through them.

14:32.574 --> 14:36.252
All right, we're on
in three, two, one...

14:36.339 --> 14:38.336
Welcome, everybody,
to the inaugural season

14:38.392 --> 14:40.716
at Oaklands's brand-new
spring training facility

14:40.752 --> 14:42.357
here in Seascape, Florida.

14:42.452 --> 14:43.507
I am Jim Brockmire.

14:43.570 --> 14:45.407
I'm joined by my partner,
Gabby Taylor.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.487
Very excited to be joining
you in the booth today, Jim,

14:47.523 --> 14:49.181
in this lovely new stadium.

14:49.217 --> 14:51.522
It is a beautiful spring
afternoon for baseball here

14:51.558 --> 14:53.872
at King Venom Vape Cartridge
Stadium.

14:53.908 --> 14:56.155
Few fun facts
about the city of Seascape,

14:56.191 --> 14:58.145
our home for the next
six weeks...

14:58.181 --> 15:01.221
two years ago, its mostly
elderly and retired citizens

15:01.257 --> 15:02.875
were duped.
They were tricked

15:02.911 --> 15:05.330
into paying for this stadium
by voting yes

15:05.366 --> 15:09.126
on the misleadingly named
Make Grandchildren Visit Act.

15:09.210 --> 15:12.141
So a $200-million-stadium
was built

15:12.177 --> 15:14.755
that nobody wanted and had
no team to occupy it.

15:14.791 --> 15:16.070
In order to lure Oakland

15:16.106 --> 15:18.345
to come all the way
across the country,

15:18.381 --> 15:21.093
the city of Seascape had to
promise them free rent,

15:21.129 --> 15:24.663
so we are party here today
to a civic boondoggle

15:24.699 --> 15:26.396
of just epic proportions.

15:26.432 --> 15:28.392
I mean,
swimming pools drained,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.437
children's educations
thwarted,

15:30.473 --> 15:31.938
shut-in's meals undelivered...

15:31.974 --> 15:36.151
all in the name of King Venom
Vape Cartridge Stadium.

15:36.187 --> 15:37.860
"King Venom Vape Cartridges,

15:37.896 --> 15:40.567
"the best in the biz.
And we're not blowing smoke.

15:40.603 --> 15:44.452
We're blowing flavor infused
vapor, ash-holezzz."

15:44.488 --> 15:46.788
Boy, that seemed needlessly
aggressive.

15:46.824 --> 15:48.205
That's enough, Jim.

15:48.241 --> 15:51.263
Are you kidding, sir?
We are on the air here.

15:51.299 --> 15:52.515
No, we're not.

15:52.551 --> 15:54.771
I knew you were gonna pull this
shit during the first game,

15:54.807 --> 15:57.787
so I lied to you about
starting the broadcast.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.397
We're actually on the air now.

15:59.433 --> 16:02.150
Oh, no, 20 seconds ago.

16:02.219 --> 16:03.525
20 seconds ago?

16:03.561 --> 16:05.098
What the fuck was that?

16:05.134 --> 16:06.348
Everything I said
was public record.

16:06.384 --> 16:07.841
It was all in the newspaper.

16:07.877 --> 16:09.203
What is the big deal?

16:09.258 --> 16:11.481
You make a big show
about how different you are,

16:11.517 --> 16:13.483
but going from drunk asshole
to sober asshole

16:13.519 --> 16:15.401
isn't the dramatic makeover
you think it is.

16:15.437 --> 16:16.980
It's not like I dragged you
into it.

16:17.016 --> 16:18.906
Yes, you did.
We are partners.

16:18.942 --> 16:20.866
My future is handcuffed
to yours,

16:20.902 --> 16:22.576
and as a black woman
in the same game

16:22.612 --> 16:23.869
that protected Art Newlie,

16:23.905 --> 16:26.112
I'm not gonna get
chance after chance like you.

16:26.148 --> 16:28.049
This is it.
I get the one.

16:28.085 --> 16:30.144
If that mic had been live,
you could have ended my career.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.711
Well, no, no,
I could not have,

16:31.747 --> 16:33.387
'cause remember I wrote that
down in the book?

16:33.423 --> 16:34.587
No, 'member?

16:34.623 --> 16:35.700
I did write it.

16:35.736 --> 16:37.300
In, in, in...

16:37.336 --> 16:38.969
- Oh, boy.
- Hey.

16:39.005 --> 16:41.704
Heard you had dead air
on your first broadcast.

16:41.740 --> 16:42.974
Wow!

16:43.090 --> 16:44.664
Seriously, if you want to go
back behind the tent,

16:44.700 --> 16:45.940
I'll make it quick.

16:45.976 --> 16:48.409
No, stay away from me
with the penis bullshit!

16:48.445 --> 16:49.744
Too fast for you!

16:49.969 --> 16:52.304
Two legs are always quicker
than three.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.643
Oh, shit!

16:59.726 --> 17:02.310
Ow.

17:02.346 --> 17:03.858
Oh, gross!

17:03.894 --> 17:06.512
God damn it.

17:06.549 --> 17:08.342
Come here.

17:10.955 --> 17:12.855
There you go.

17:12.891 --> 17:15.519
Have a nice life.

17:20.625 --> 17:23.767
Jim, you wanna have your
public meltdown now or later?

17:23.803 --> 17:25.656
Going from drunk asshole
to sober asshole...

17:25.693 --> 17:27.604
There was a woman crying
out for help,

17:27.640 --> 17:30.641
scared and alone.
What did you do about it?

17:30.677 --> 17:31.899
You can't change.

17:31.935 --> 17:33.669
You were born broken
and made worse.

17:33.705 --> 17:34.767
Little piece of shit.

17:34.803 --> 17:38.358
You are just a miserable
piece of shit!

17:38.394 --> 17:39.998
What's going on?

17:40.061 --> 17:42.651
What's going on is
I haven't slept in a week.

17:42.698 --> 17:43.875
Almost got fired my first day,

17:43.911 --> 17:46.002
everybody at work
hates my guts.

17:46.081 --> 17:49.712
I mean, as insane as this might
sound to say out loud,

17:49.748 --> 17:52.298
it's like nobody
even cares that I am sober.

17:52.460 --> 17:54.983
They don't.
Jesus. What do you expect?

17:55.019 --> 17:56.479
A parade?

17:56.547 --> 17:58.429
Para... A party, maybe.

17:58.799 --> 18:00.802
You know, lots of soda,
and people hugging me,

18:00.838 --> 18:02.804
telling me how proud
they are of me.

18:03.125 --> 18:05.109
Maybe Joe Buck'd give a speech.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.565
Everybody chips in
and buys me a star.

18:07.601 --> 18:10.777
You know, like a constellation.
I'm just spitballing.

18:12.231 --> 18:15.281
God, Earl's gonna love
that one.

18:15.317 --> 18:17.312
I thought this was
supposed to be anonymous.

18:17.348 --> 18:19.010
Oh, yeah, no,
no, it is.

18:19.046 --> 18:21.156
Don't worry, I never mention
you by name.

18:21.192 --> 18:23.791
I just told him you were
a famous sportscaster

18:23.827 --> 18:25.967
known for a string of
public meltdowns.

18:26.003 --> 18:28.220
Well, that narrows it down
to me and Marv Albert,

18:28.256 --> 18:29.846
and Marv ain't in Seascape,
Shirley.

18:29.882 --> 18:32.609
Look, people are just gonna
doubt you

18:32.645 --> 18:35.363
till you can prove you're
making different choices.

18:35.399 --> 18:37.125
But I am making
different choices.

18:37.161 --> 18:39.766
In the old days, I would have
ripped Matt and new one.

18:39.802 --> 18:41.706
Nobody talks to me like that
and gets a pass,

18:41.742 --> 18:44.605
but I held my tongue
on account of the cancer.

18:44.641 --> 18:48.410
You want credit for not
insulting a man with cancer?

18:48.446 --> 18:49.902
Yeah!

18:49.938 --> 18:53.698
I'm gonna guess you started
drinking at, uh, 15.

18:53.734 --> 18:55.659
That's right.
How did you know that?

18:55.695 --> 18:59.900
Well, an alcoholic's maturity
usually freezes in time

19:00.074 --> 19:02.833
right about when they first
pick up the bottle.

19:03.106 --> 19:04.845
Also I have a shitty,
know-it-all

19:04.881 --> 19:06.889
15-year-old at home.

19:06.970 --> 19:08.288
Makes sense.

19:08.324 --> 19:10.110
I do jerk it
like a 15-year-old.

19:10.146 --> 19:13.135
He buys these Costco-sized
tubs of lotion

19:13.171 --> 19:14.846
for his dry hands.

19:14.882 --> 19:16.639
I still don't know why
he needs the candles.

19:16.675 --> 19:19.787
Mm. You know, sometimes
you want to treat yourself.

19:19.823 --> 19:22.290
I often put on Sade...

19:22.480 --> 19:25.989
make a night of it.

19:26.025 --> 19:28.491
Okay, so, look,

19:28.527 --> 19:30.493
the key to relationships

19:30.645 --> 19:32.281
is to learn
how to be in one

19:32.317 --> 19:34.766
without expecting anything
in return.

19:34.877 --> 19:36.389
Well, how's that
a relationship?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.288
Where's the transaction?

19:38.324 --> 19:40.540
Just start out with a plant.

19:40.576 --> 19:42.900
Or, you know, a very
low-maintenance pet

19:42.963 --> 19:46.922
like a lizard, or a snake,

19:46.958 --> 19:51.046
I don't know.
You know? A frog.

19:53.419 --> 19:57.132
I wouldn't even know
where to get one of those.

19:57.461 --> 19:58.629
Hey.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.706
You were right, okay?
I'm an asshole.

20:02.742 --> 20:03.707
I'm a total asshole.

20:03.743 --> 20:06.028
I want to be a good person
like you.

20:06.064 --> 20:06.817
I really do.

20:06.853 --> 20:09.213
I just have no idea
how to go about it.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.684
I know that not littering
figures prominently.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.468
Beyond that,
I'm just winging it.

20:13.504 --> 20:14.886
Please be patient with me,
okay?

20:14.922 --> 20:17.014
I promise you
I'm gonna do better.

20:17.380 --> 20:19.781
Hmm. I see
you're wearing that pin

20:19.817 --> 20:22.449
in a cheap ploy
to win my affection.

20:22.572 --> 20:23.704
Cheap?

20:23.740 --> 20:26.832
Paid a fortune to have these
overnighted from China.

20:26.868 --> 20:29.648
I gave one to Gus,
and I apologized to him.

20:29.684 --> 20:30.327
Hmm.

20:30.363 --> 20:32.597
See, I thought you might be
skeptical,

20:32.633 --> 20:33.897
so I took a picture of us

20:33.933 --> 20:37.317
with today's paper
as proof of pin.

20:37.981 --> 20:39.362
- Huh.
- See?

20:39.398 --> 20:41.241
I really want to be on
your team, Gabby.

20:41.303 --> 20:44.980
And even more than that,
I'd like to be your friend.

20:45.016 --> 20:47.421
Okay, yeah, I mean,

20:47.499 --> 20:48.410
I don't know about friend,

20:48.446 --> 20:50.897
but I could use
a workout partner.

20:50.933 --> 20:51.980
I'll take what I can get.

20:52.016 --> 20:54.381
Now, I've been exercising
a lot since I got sober.

20:54.417 --> 20:56.615
I'm not the fastest runner
in the world,

20:56.651 --> 20:59.386
but are you familiar with
the story of the tortoise and...

20:59.422 --> 21:00.815
- Shit!
- What?

21:00.851 --> 21:01.902
Where are you going?

21:01.938 --> 21:03.599
I just threw away
my one chance

21:03.657 --> 21:06.243
at healthy,
adult relationships.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.210
Turtle!

21:11.203 --> 21:13.522
How far could you get?

21:16.558 --> 21:19.854
Help.

21:20.738 --> 21:22.781
Help...

21:37.391 --> 21:42.391
