01:45.189 --> 01:48.024
Give up, Mr. Simpson! We know
you have the Olympic torch!

01:48.233 --> 01:51.277
For God sakes, Homer!
Give them back their flame!

01:51.361 --> 01:55.072
No! The Olympics have preempted my
favorite shows for the last time.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.617
You can always find your
favorite shows next month.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.453
You wait till next month!
You wait till next month!

02:00.537 --> 02:03.456
Every four years.

02:06.502 --> 02:08.127
We've recovered the flame!

02:08.211 --> 02:11.047
It's beautiful.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.012
Are you okay?

02:18.096 --> 02:19.263
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:20.516 --> 02:26.145
No!

02:28.023 --> 02:30.274
I'm bored.

02:30.692 --> 02:31.901
Hey, a fair!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.988
Springfield Preparatory School?

02:36.073 --> 02:39.367
Dad, you told me there were no
private schools in Springfield.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.953
But knowing about it would
make you want to go here.

02:42.037 --> 02:44.372
Hello and thank you for
coming to our fundraiser.

02:44.456 --> 02:47.250
I'm headmaster St.
John Van Hookstratten.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.877
10-4, Princess. Is that your beer tent?

02:49.962 --> 02:51.712
Monkeys point.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.965
Monkeys cry.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.848
This campus is so lush and verdant.

03:01.932 --> 03:05.935
Yes. You probably recognize it
from the film Calling All Coeds.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.021
Oh! Is that where Boozer drank the pee?

03:09.106 --> 03:11.107
It's one of the places.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.781
Sorry.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.493
This school has everything.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.037
I know. Doesn't it just honk you off?

03:25.205 --> 03:29.584
Their periodic table has 250 elements!

03:29.668 --> 03:32.295
And our school board's
cut us back to 16.

03:32.379 --> 03:34.088
All of them lanthanides.

03:34.172 --> 03:37.383
You know, we could get equipment
like this through a bond issue.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.136
Here's your bond issue!

03:43.181 --> 03:44.223
Quick. Take these.

03:44.308 --> 03:45.850
Principal Skinner, you're just stealing.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.436
Welcome to Dick Cheney's America.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.898
Mmm! All this food is so froufrou.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.649
Ooh!

03:53.942 --> 03:56.068
Faberge egg salad.

03:56.445 --> 03:58.821
Look, Brandine. It's Wolfgang Puck.

03:59.156 --> 04:04.160
Mr. Puck, you make the only grub
what satisfies my gut worm, I swear.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.995
Try my Rice Krispie squares.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.915
They are wasabi-infused
with a portobello glaze.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.167
And you can buy them at the airport.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.877
I make mine with M&M's.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.170
With M&M's?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.589
Now that's what I call fusion.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.507
I could sell them on the Internet.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.177
To the Puck-mobile!

04:22.179 --> 04:24.013
Ha! Go, go, go!

04:34.107 --> 04:38.027
No one's doing any bumping. Time
to ram-a-lam these ding-dongs.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.542
Good show.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.757
Hey, Marge. Watch me burn Flanders.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.551
"Ned Flanders bids $50."

05:04.763 --> 05:07.974
And the winner of the
$100 bill is Ned Flanders!

05:10.227 --> 05:12.311
This is going right to the orphanage.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.317
We have a winner!

05:20.070 --> 05:22.488
These will be great for
advancing our research.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.824
Yes. Our research.

05:32.499 --> 05:35.334
Hey, that's my backpack!

05:35.419 --> 05:36.919
Look at her cry!

05:38.797 --> 05:41.674
New money always cries!

05:44.594 --> 05:46.178
Drop the backpack, Jack.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.264
The name is Jackington.

05:49.850 --> 05:50.891
Retreat!

05:50.976 --> 05:52.018
To the Hamptons!

05:52.102 --> 05:53.728
Tra-la-la,
la-la-la!

05:59.484 --> 06:02.486
You were so brave to
take on all those bullies.

06:02.571 --> 06:05.239
Those weren't bullies. That's a bully.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.034
Hey, butler, stop butling yourself.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.745
Would that I could, sir.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.456
Time to go, Greta.

06:13.540 --> 06:16.792
Your mother's custody
starts at 1800 hours.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.711
Your dad's McBain?

06:18.795 --> 06:21.547
I've played many characters.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.468
McBain, Officer Nick
Vengeance, Sergeant Murder,

06:25.719 --> 06:28.137
and I was a voice on the Frasier.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.930
Would you like to come
to my house sometime?

06:30.015 --> 06:31.307
If it's okay with my dad.

06:31.391 --> 06:35.436
Come. We play Uno. I chase
you with hose. No biggie.

06:35.729 --> 06:39.398
Wow. Cool! I guess we're leaving, too.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.860
No, I belong here! Please!

06:42.944 --> 06:44.070
Don't worry, honey.

06:44.154 --> 06:47.364
We can't afford this now, but
when it's time for college,

06:47.449 --> 06:51.577
I promise my darling daughter can
go to the finest school there is.

06:51.787 --> 06:52.870
In South Carolina.

06:52.954 --> 06:56.082
Oh! I will not be a Gamecock!

06:56.166 --> 06:57.249
You will too!

06:57.334 --> 06:58.375
No!

07:01.129 --> 07:02.421
Go Gamecocks!

07:02.506 --> 07:04.006
No!

07:07.886 --> 07:10.888
It's so cute you're going
to a little girl's house.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.307
Look, boy, here's my advice on women.

07:13.391 --> 07:16.477
Don't give them nicknames
like "Jumbo" or "Boxcar,"

07:16.561 --> 07:20.356
and always get receipts. Makes
you look like a business guy.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.360
What the hell is that?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.244
That car's as big as all outdoors!

07:33.328 --> 07:35.371
Wow. What kind of mileage does it get?

07:35.539 --> 07:38.040
One highway, zero city.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.044
Mmm-hmm.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.134
Bart, your little tie makes me smile.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.679
Excuse me, but you don't sound
as tough as you do in the movies.

07:51.763 --> 07:53.931
If you don't shut your big yap,

07:54.015 --> 07:57.101
I will rip off your face
and use it as a napkin!

08:02.107 --> 08:03.691
Laughing time is over.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.698
These are props from
one of my dad's movies,

08:10.782 --> 08:12.825
The Incredible Shrinking McBain.

08:12.909 --> 08:15.744
Wow! The Q-tip he used
to kill Ross Perot.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.790
Everything in your house is so cool.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.167
What's your house like?

08:21.251 --> 08:24.211
Oh, it's okay. My bed
is stuffed with hay.

08:24.421 --> 08:27.214
Bart, you're so funny.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.300
Yeah.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.679
You haven't seen Itchy & Scratchy
till you've seen it on DVD.

08:33.763 --> 08:37.015
The Itchy & Scratchy Show

08:44.441 --> 08:46.275
Oh, my body!

08:50.155 --> 08:52.156
Check out the audio commentary.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.366
We shot this at 4:00 in the morning,

08:54.451 --> 08:56.535
and the crew was
getting a little cranky.

08:56.620 --> 09:00.623
You can never get enough
takes for Steven Soderbergh.

09:01.291 --> 09:02.708
Always wants more...

09:08.590 --> 09:11.008
I hope you enjoy these German sausages.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.136
I've been grinding all day,
so I'm not sure what organ meat

09:14.221 --> 09:16.430
is in what intestinal casing.

09:16.598 --> 09:20.226
Bratwurst? Sauerbraten? Donderblitzen?

09:20.310 --> 09:22.895
Oh, Mom, isn't there
anything vegetarian?

09:23.021 --> 09:27.024
Homer, I see your daughter
is one of those whale-kissing,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.318
Dukakis-hugging moon maidens.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.237
Yeah, one time she...

09:31.321 --> 09:33.739
She's looking at us. Be cool.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.041
What are you doing?

09:44.501 --> 09:47.419
Oh, I gotcha.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.506
One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war!

09:53.343 --> 09:54.343
One, two, three!

09:54.427 --> 09:56.345
Hey, that was a fast count!

09:57.555 --> 10:01.433
Remember when I said I
would eat you last? I lied.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.273
Hi, Bart.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.942
Whazzup!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.986
Oh! You brought someone.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.112
Yeah, this is Milhouse.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.281
He's my best friend because...

10:15.365 --> 10:17.908
Well, geographical convenience, really.

10:18.243 --> 10:20.869
I'm wearing my bathing
suit under my pants.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.955
Um... You want to go swimming?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.708
Okay, but you have to watch me dive.

10:25.917 --> 10:26.917
Fine.

10:27.002 --> 10:28.627
Do you promise?

10:28.795 --> 10:30.045
Just go!

10:34.384 --> 10:36.927
He'll sleep tonight!

10:37.679 --> 10:41.557
Hello, gentlemen. Would you
care to meet my new best friend?

10:41.891 --> 10:43.976
Rainier Wolfcastle?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.436
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

10:45.520 --> 10:47.604
Hey, I've been using that
ab roller you endorse,

10:47.689 --> 10:49.606
but I haven't gotten any results.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.651
Right, because you've
been using it backward.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.445
Are you really Homer's friend?

10:54.529 --> 10:56.989
After they shoot your movies,
who gets the leftover film?

10:57.073 --> 10:59.658
Is it true that if I
kill you, I become you?

10:59.743 --> 11:04.121
This looks like a job for
my authorized look-alike.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.252
Hi, I'm Chuck. I live in his trunk.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.087
So how much you look-alikes make?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.590
'Cause some say I look
like Macaulay Culkin.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.519
These courtside seats are great.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.063
Thanks for the hookup, Wolfie.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.732
I just want my daughter to be happy.

11:32.067 --> 11:34.610
Plus, you eat the pretzels
I drop on the floor.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.236
That I do, sir.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.990
Bart, my school's having a dance.

11:40.283 --> 11:43.410
It's pretty lame, but
maybe you can make it fun,

11:43.703 --> 11:44.870
if we went together.

11:44.954 --> 11:45.996
Yeah, I guess.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.874
Defense! Defense! Defense!

11:48.958 --> 11:50.042
Defense! Defense! Defense!

11:52.003 --> 11:54.296
Ouch! I sat on something sharp!

11:54.381 --> 11:56.632
Oh, that's just Lara Flynn Boyle.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.469
I have a Boyle on my ass!

12:02.305 --> 12:05.724
Now, Willie, don't tell anyone I'm
trying my stand-up comedy act tonight.

12:05.809 --> 12:08.018
If the students find out
I'm performing at Floppy's,

12:08.103 --> 12:09.436
I'll never live it down.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.563
I won't tell if you put
me on the guest list.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.399
All right. Plus one?

12:13.483 --> 12:14.525
Nay.

12:14.609 --> 12:17.236
Now, I'll give you directions
starting from the Simpsons' house.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.988
We are so there!

12:20.073 --> 12:23.200
Aren't you supposed to take
Greta to the dance tonight?

12:23.284 --> 12:26.412
Oh, yeah. Maybe I
should keep my promise.

12:26.913 --> 12:30.749
I just hope the audience is
kind because my material is weak,

12:31.167 --> 12:32.668
and I have that bladder thing.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.962
That's it! I'm blowing off the dance!

12:35.046 --> 12:37.756
This is the biggest thing that's
happened to me since chocolate milk!

12:37.841 --> 12:39.800
They've got chocolate milk now?

12:44.556 --> 12:47.599
That was the prop comedy
of the sea captain.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.935
More like "thar he blows!"

12:51.938 --> 12:54.356
Yarr, I'm so sorry.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.234
All right. Let's keep
this train wreck moving.

12:57.318 --> 13:01.905
Principal Skinner? I know him.
He's not funny. Well, enjoy.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.621
So, it's standardized
testing time again.

13:09.706 --> 13:13.500
Have you ever noticed how the dumb
kids fill in the wrong circles?

13:13.585 --> 13:16.086
Seymour! Seymour!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.797
Lost my place.

13:20.008 --> 13:24.178
Maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe a little
improv would raise the roof here.

13:24.262 --> 13:25.971
Would someone name a profession?

13:26.055 --> 13:27.598
Loser Principal!

13:27.682 --> 13:28.807
Uh...

13:28.892 --> 13:31.310
I think I heard California surfer.

13:33.730 --> 13:35.522
You suck, Seymour!

13:44.032 --> 13:45.824
Oh, man. What a dork.

13:46.075 --> 13:48.744
Greta called. It seems
you told her you were sick.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.788
Lisa, I only lied because
it was the easiest way

13:51.873 --> 13:52.956
to get what I wanted.

13:53.041 --> 13:56.335
Bart, this girl is in love
with you! Think about it!

14:16.105 --> 14:20.734
Hey, I didn't lead her on. I
always played it light and breezy.

14:20.818 --> 14:22.528
Well, if you don't
feel the way Greta does,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.780
you've got to tell her
before she gets hurt.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.198
All right. I know what to do.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.367
I'll dump her like she's
never been dumped before.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.077
Then we'll go right
back to being friends.

14:30.161 --> 14:33.372
Well, Bart, you really understand women.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.959
Lise, women are easy.
State capitals are hard!

14:38.628 --> 14:40.379
And where were you?

14:40.463 --> 14:41.505
Cockfight.

14:44.801 --> 14:46.218
You're breaking up with me?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.854
Don't worry. We get that a lot here.

14:57.939 --> 15:01.984
Lou, you can't leave
the force! I can change!

15:02.318 --> 15:05.070
I just think there's more
money in private security.

15:05.154 --> 15:07.864
All I'm hearing is I'm too fat.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.455
Aren't I?

15:24.757 --> 15:26.758
I can't believe he dumped me!

15:26.843 --> 15:30.345
In my movies, this is
where I would go berserk.

15:31.556 --> 15:33.974
Dad, this isn't a movie.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.436
No. Let my muscles hug you.

15:42.191 --> 15:45.110
Greta, I'm sorry I didn't
handle the breakup well,

15:45.194 --> 15:48.864
but you're a sweet kid and
someday you'll find someone who...

15:48.948 --> 15:51.742
Whazzup!

15:52.118 --> 15:53.869
Milhouse? Greta?

15:54.579 --> 15:56.663
Well, no one has to draw me a picture!

15:56.748 --> 15:58.040
Oh! But I did.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.877
Greta, is this how it is?

16:01.961 --> 16:03.003
Yes.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.380
Except he kissed me in the eye.

16:08.718 --> 16:14.181
I was an idiot. Now I'll be alone
forever. Why did I break up with her?

16:14.807 --> 16:16.475
Oh, Bart, it's human nature.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.019
You only want her because
someone else has her.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.104
Prove it, using examples from this room.

16:21.189 --> 16:24.441
All right, look. Maggie's not
playing with this ball right now,

16:24.525 --> 16:26.568
but look what happens when I take it.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.280
See? Give me the ball! Give me the ball!

16:32.784 --> 16:36.411
She use ta be She use ta be my girl

16:37.121 --> 16:39.706
She use ta be my girl

16:39.791 --> 16:41.625
I wouldn't lie about a thing like that

16:41.709 --> 16:43.543
She use ta be my girl

16:44.379 --> 16:47.506
Well, well She use ta be my girl

16:49.759 --> 16:51.802
Leave a message at the beep.

16:51.886 --> 16:54.596
But don't be a message
monster hogging all my tape!

16:54.681 --> 16:56.973
Uh, Greta, it's me.

16:57.058 --> 16:59.643
I think you left your pencil
over at my house, and...

16:59.727 --> 17:01.728
He's there now, isn't he?

17:01.813 --> 17:04.021
I knew it. You're
there. Just hear me out.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.441
Bart, forget it. I'm
leaving in 10 minutes.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.193
My dad's shooting a movie in Toronto.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.362
You're going to Spain?

17:10.445 --> 17:11.696
Goodbye, Bart.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.702
So to win Greta back,
I have to go to Toronto.

17:16.953 --> 17:20.789
Canada? Why should we leave
America to visit America Junior?

17:21.040 --> 17:25.210
This is for love, Dad. Someday
you'll feel what I feel.

17:25.336 --> 17:29.297
It's only fair. We went to
Europe when Lisa lost her balloon.

17:29.465 --> 17:31.466
Maggie, what do you think?

17:31.592 --> 17:35.971
All right, Son. We'll
all go! First class!

17:47.817 --> 17:52.404
It's so clean and bland. I'm home!

17:53.614 --> 17:56.908
Wow! This bus station is the
birthplace of Paul Shaffer.

17:57.952 --> 18:00.203
Dad, no! It says, "Don't walk!"

18:00.288 --> 18:02.205
It doesn't matter. They
have free health care.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.332
Whoa! I'm rich!

18:04.625 --> 18:07.711
Take off! To the Great White North!

18:07.795 --> 18:11.006
Take off! It's a beauty way to go!

18:11.090 --> 18:12.257
Take off...

18:12.592 --> 18:14.259
I'm a 10-year-old
boy in Toronto.

18:14.343 --> 18:16.636
I should be the happiest
kid in the world.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.764
But I can't stop thinking about Greta!

18:18.848 --> 18:22.225
You'll win her back, eh. And B,
we're closing in five minutes.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.686
Would a US dollar change your mind?

18:24.771 --> 18:26.021
American currency!

18:26.773 --> 18:28.315
What time would you
like your breakfast, sir?

18:28.399 --> 18:31.276
Take off! To the Great White North!

18:31.360 --> 18:34.863
Over there you can see them
shooting the film Canadian Graffiti.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.827
Oh, I see you drive on the left up here.

18:40.912 --> 18:42.412
No, Ma'am. I'm drunk.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.664
There it is! Wolfcastle's movie set!

18:53.007 --> 18:56.218
Excuse me. Which way to the chess club?

18:56.552 --> 18:58.386
What's your name, nerd?

18:58.471 --> 19:00.722
Melvin Eugene Puny-meyer.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.975
Well, well, a big muscle-bound nerd.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.645
Ha! Just more of you to pick on.

19:06.729 --> 19:09.105
The geek shall inherit the earth.

19:13.361 --> 19:14.653
There she is, boy.

19:14.737 --> 19:15.821
I don't know, Dad.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.197
What if she's still mad at me?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.406
Listen to me, Son.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.825
No one loves a quitter.

19:19.909 --> 19:22.494
So you go over there
and you win her back.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.162
But she might say no.

19:24.247 --> 19:26.957
Oh, I quit. There's no convincing you.

19:27.041 --> 19:29.584
I'm gonna take a nap.

19:35.550 --> 19:39.177
You're not gonna win her back.
She's with the "House" now.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.306
Milhouse, she's only dating
you to get back at me.

19:43.391 --> 19:46.059
My therapist said that's
all I could ever hope for.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.936
So take off, hoser!

19:52.692 --> 19:55.193
I'm gonna knock you
into the next province!

19:58.865 --> 20:02.158
Well, we've seen some
wild sweeping here today.

20:02.410 --> 20:05.871
Yes. The broom handling
has been truly dazzling.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.623
What's this?

20:09.125 --> 20:12.836
Two young Yankee Doodles have
turned this match into a dandy.

20:14.130 --> 20:16.590
Both our viewers must be thrilled.

20:19.594 --> 20:23.138
Greta, I miss you so much.
Please be my girlfriend again.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.432
No. Yes!

20:25.641 --> 20:27.475
The "House" always wins!

20:27.560 --> 20:28.768
Sorry, Milhouse.

20:28.853 --> 20:31.646
I thought Canada would
save our relationship,

20:31.731 --> 20:33.023
but it only made it worse.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.067
You're breaking up with me? Why?

20:36.152 --> 20:40.030
I guess I was just looking
for someone more masculine.

20:40.114 --> 20:43.825
I told you! I don't know how
that scrunchie got in my hair!

20:43.993 --> 20:48.121
Sorry, guys. But you two have put me
off dating for at least four years.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.916
I think I'll just buckle down
and co-produce my dad's movies.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.460
Need a unit production manager?

20:53.544 --> 20:54.711
It's too late, Bart.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.757
Well, I guess we're single again.

20:58.841 --> 21:02.010
I can't believe I have
to give her half my stuff!

21:02.094 --> 21:03.762
But are we still friends?

21:03.846 --> 21:06.514
Till the next one.
So, what do we do now?

21:06.682 --> 21:10.894
Well, we're in Canada.
Let's find something fun!

21:11.354 --> 21:13.772
I've got just the ticket! Come on!

21:16.442 --> 21:19.527
I can't believe we're on the
Canadian Olympic Basketball team.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.696
Yep. It's just that easy.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.118
Wow, that was close.
You can be the center.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.667
How come you always
run out of tardy slips

21:33.751 --> 21:36.378
before you run out of permission slips?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.046
How come you suck?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.130
Uh...

21:39.382 --> 21:40.840
I lack confidence?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.721
Whazzup!
