01:41.231 --> 01:43.886
- Hi.
- Hi. Are you Heather?

01:43.886 --> 01:45.888
- Yeah.
- Hi, Heather.

01:45.888 --> 01:46.932
- Are you Jay?
- I am.

01:46.932 --> 01:48.238
It's nice to meet you.

01:48.238 --> 01:49.848
It's a pleasure
to meet you, too.

01:49.848 --> 01:51.459
- Oh, look--look, we match.
- Oh, we do match. Hey, yeah.

01:51.459 --> 01:52.677
- This is meant to be.
- Got the memo.

01:52.677 --> 01:54.766
- Welcome to the Alliance.
- Thank you.

01:54.766 --> 01:56.768
This is my first time here,
so I'm, like, thrilled

01:56.768 --> 01:58.901
to check it out.
This is, like, beautiful.

01:58.901 --> 02:02.209
So this is kind of what we're
looking at for the choir stuff?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.906
Yeah, so this whole space
is all open to you,

02:03.906 --> 02:06.169
and then this side as well.
- Okay. Awesome.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.476
I have so many stresses
piling up on me,

02:08.476 --> 02:09.955
but at the same time,
I need an outlet.

02:09.955 --> 02:13.742
I need a resource to, like,
renew my soul.

02:13.742 --> 02:17.137
And so I've decided to form...
a choir.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.921
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:18.921 --> 02:20.966
- What's up?
- We're just getting acquainted.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.968
This is Jay. He's the--
runs the Alliance Theater.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.535
- Oh, hi. So nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

02:24.535 --> 02:26.189
This is my business partner, Dre.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.930
- Dre.
- And she's gonna be

02:27.930 --> 02:29.453
doing it with me.
- Yes.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.151
If you have any questions
for me,

02:31.151 --> 02:32.282
I'll just be in the office. I'm
just gonna take a call, so...

02:32.282 --> 02:33.631
- Okay.
- All right? Yeah.

02:33.631 --> 02:34.719
- Thank you so much.
- Nice to meet you both.

02:34.719 --> 02:35.981
- Appreciate it.
- Yeah, all right.

02:35.981 --> 02:37.679
- This will be fabulous.
- Is Cory here yet?

02:37.679 --> 02:39.333
Speak of the devil.
There he is.

02:39.333 --> 02:42.466
- We were just talking about you.
- Hey. Were you talking about me?

02:42.466 --> 02:44.164
- Yes.
- I haven't seen you both in so--

02:44.164 --> 02:47.123
- I know.
- Look how gorgeous.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.473
Cory was raised
Southern Baptist,

02:49.473 --> 02:52.172
and he was a choir director
for 27 years,

02:52.172 --> 02:53.999
and so I know he misses it, too.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.740
One night Cory and I
were playing the piano

02:55.740 --> 02:57.873
and singing together
at my house,

02:57.873 --> 03:02.182
and I remembered how great
it felt to sing with friends.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.967
This is something I want to
create 'cause it doesn't exist.

03:04.967 --> 03:07.230
There's not a place
that I can go right now

03:07.230 --> 03:10.190
and sing spiritual
or non-spiritual songs

03:10.190 --> 03:13.193
with a community that I love.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.890
- Yeah.
- I just feel like

03:14.890 --> 03:17.762
my spiritual community side
is lacking,

03:17.762 --> 03:20.243
and I used to have that
every single week.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.549
Yeah.

03:21.549 --> 03:23.333
And that is the first thing
I'm missing.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.074
I'm missing sitting
with my family,

03:25.074 --> 03:29.861
singing, and feeling, you know,
the presence of God in my life.

03:29.861 --> 03:31.341
Yeah.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.691
Choir to Mormons is community,

03:33.691 --> 03:37.260
it's worship, it's music,
and it's service.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.393
But I can form my own choir

03:39.393 --> 03:42.004
and sing with people
who feel the same as me,

03:42.004 --> 03:44.789
and that feels empowering.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.358
It feels like I'm taking
a little piece of my life back.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.230
I wanna get this going
as soon as possible.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.232
Is there anything we need to do
to prepare for our auditions,

03:52.232 --> 03:53.798
or could we just get together,

03:53.798 --> 03:56.453
come up with some
basic sight reading sheets?

03:56.453 --> 03:57.628
Yeah, I can secure, like,
what the audition process

03:57.628 --> 04:00.718
will look like musically.
- Awesome.

04:00.718 --> 04:02.807
We tell people we're having
a week of auditions

04:02.807 --> 04:05.810
and then a week for us
to cobble together our choir,

04:05.810 --> 04:08.770
and then our first rehearsal
can be in the next few weeks.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.337
- The momentum is starting.
- Yes.

04:10.337 --> 04:12.252
Babe,
Easter's around the corner,

04:12.252 --> 04:14.384
and what is Easter
without a hymn?

04:14.384 --> 04:16.734
I'll have him and him and him.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.710
Well, did a few things
to spruce it up, baby.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.102
Okay.

04:37.102 --> 04:38.756
You know, we about to get crazy.

04:38.756 --> 04:41.411
- We about to get high?
- Well, not like that, but...

04:41.411 --> 04:43.674
- Okay.
- ...a little bit.

04:43.674 --> 04:45.937
- Look.
- This is so awesome.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.765
- It's a little different.
- Hi, guys.

04:47.765 --> 04:48.897
Oh, hi.

04:48.897 --> 04:50.290
Welcome to Altitude
in West Jordan.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.553
- How are y'all?
- Good.

04:52.553 --> 04:53.858
Welcome.
What brings us in tonight?

04:53.858 --> 04:56.339
Just date night.
I wanna do something different

04:56.339 --> 04:57.732
and have her do
something different.

05:03.607 --> 05:05.870
This is one of those times
where you're not supposed

05:05.870 --> 05:10.005
to, like, say what is going
though your mind.

05:10.005 --> 05:12.921
What the [bleep], though?
What is going on?

05:12.921 --> 05:14.575
Why the [bleep]?
Where are we, jungle gyms?

05:14.575 --> 05:16.838
What--What's happening?

05:16.838 --> 05:18.230
- Come on. We gotta go over here.
- Whew.

05:18.230 --> 05:19.884
Let's go in there.
We gotta go through ever one.

05:19.884 --> 05:23.235
Boom, ba-boom, ba-boom.
Go ahead. Get crazy.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.985
Don't hit me.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.291
Yes!

05:38.729 --> 05:41.166
Bunny.

05:41.166 --> 05:43.212
What are you doing?

05:44.648 --> 05:46.650
You did good, honey.
Good job.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.565
I'm gonna go
all the way across.

05:48.565 --> 05:51.133
I don't think you can do it tonight.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.396
We have to work up to that.

05:53.396 --> 05:55.877
- I love you.
- Love you, too.

05:55.877 --> 06:00.838
Mwah. Thank you for continuing
to help me find

06:00.838 --> 06:02.405
the good things every day
and the positive things...

06:02.405 --> 06:04.494
- Every day.
- ...and to keep moving on

06:04.494 --> 06:06.104
and moving forward.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.846
But you know, honey, there's
still the bullsh-- every day.

06:10.718 --> 06:12.981
I think I mentioned to you,
like, I don't know,

06:12.981 --> 06:16.376
six, seven months ago,
there was some account out there

06:16.376 --> 06:17.855
called @shahxposed.

06:17.855 --> 06:19.379
Yeah.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.947
Lisa sent a bunch of stuff
to me, like, last October.

06:22.947 --> 06:26.951
@shahxposed was
an Instagram account

06:26.951 --> 06:29.214
that was commenting
very negatively

06:29.214 --> 06:32.435
about Lisa online, me online.

06:32.435 --> 06:34.568
This is two months before
I'm going to trial.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.004
I have bigger issues
to worry about

06:36.004 --> 06:40.225
than some stupid @shahxposed
account at this time.

06:40.225 --> 06:43.533
And I just wanted to, like,
bury it and not ever discuss it.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.493
So, you know,
seven months go by, whatever,

06:46.493 --> 06:50.322
And then Lisa told me that
Chris Harington,

06:50.322 --> 06:51.933
Angie Harrington's husband,

06:51.933 --> 06:54.326
was the one that set up
this fake account.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.111
- Why would he do that?
- Nev--

06:56.111 --> 06:57.547
We've never done anything
to his family.

06:57.547 --> 06:59.419
never said anything
to his wife, his--

06:59.419 --> 07:00.463
- Never.
- Never.

07:00.463 --> 07:02.465
We've never done anything
to him.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.075
I know what it's like to be

07:04.075 --> 07:05.512
accused of something
that you didn't do.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.862
Even though things look
a certain way...

07:07.862 --> 07:09.298
- Right.
- I didn't know that it would

07:09.298 --> 07:11.126
come to this point where
I ever needed to discuss it

07:11.126 --> 07:12.910
with anybody,
you know what I mean?

07:12.910 --> 07:15.609
But now at this point,
I feel like I need to find out,

07:15.609 --> 07:18.133
because Angie Harrington
is inserting herself

07:18.133 --> 07:22.572
into my life, my friends' lives
where now it does matter.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.661
Listen, I can deal with a lot personally,

07:24.661 --> 07:26.576
but you used @shahxposed.

07:26.576 --> 07:28.099
You didn't say "Jen Exposed."

07:28.099 --> 07:31.494
You didn't say
"Jen Shah Exposed."

07:31.494 --> 07:33.017
So you just humiliated

07:33.017 --> 07:35.890
and disrespected
my entire family.

07:38.109 --> 07:39.676
I'm not here to, like,
save anybody's feelings

07:39.676 --> 07:44.028
from it anymore
if it's at my expense.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.339
<i>Coming up...</i>

07:50.339 --> 07:52.994
There was gonna be
a conflict of interest.

07:52.994 --> 07:56.606
The fact that your wife
has a career and is successful,

07:56.606 --> 07:59.479
you can no longer work here.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.449
Hey.

08:13.449 --> 08:14.885
What's up?

08:14.885 --> 08:19.281
Just working. Everything's been,
like, so crazy lately.

08:19.281 --> 08:21.196
I just feel like I gotta get
on top of everything.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.590
- Hey, what's up, dude?
- What's up, guys?

08:23.590 --> 08:26.201
- Hey. Where have you been?
- Downstairs.

08:26.201 --> 08:28.551
Oh, you've been quiet. I didn't
even know you were home.

08:28.551 --> 08:30.684
Well, cool.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.034
I got an email
from your guidance counselor.

08:33.034 --> 08:35.689
Good or bad?

08:35.689 --> 08:37.038
She was just checking in
to see, like,

08:37.038 --> 08:40.563
what schools you were
interested in going to,

08:40.563 --> 08:42.347
if that's even an option,
where we were

08:42.347 --> 08:44.741
in the conversation with you
so that she could basically

08:44.741 --> 08:49.616
help you out, so...
what are you thinking?

08:49.616 --> 08:51.313
I don't know. I...
I go back and forth.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.357
Come sit over here by me.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.708
Flop down. Um...

08:54.708 --> 08:57.624
Have you been thinking
about it at all?

09:04.848 --> 09:10.593
I feel like Jack has this
literally false sense of reality

09:10.593 --> 09:13.727
on, like, how easy things
actually are.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.555
What are you thinking about
with college?

09:15.555 --> 09:17.731
Fudge college, honestly.

09:17.731 --> 09:21.256
I already own a company.

09:21.256 --> 09:23.606
I think Jack thinks everything
just happens like magic.

09:23.606 --> 09:26.043
Somebody needs a reality check.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.002
When you think about going
to school,

09:28.002 --> 09:30.134
like, what makes you
not wanna go?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.397
I've seen people, like,
all over the internet,

09:32.397 --> 09:34.835
there's, like, a few, like,
really big entrepreneur guys

09:34.835 --> 09:36.358
that are, like,
"Don't go to college.

09:36.358 --> 09:40.101
Just, like, find someone
who you really like and mentor.

09:40.101 --> 09:42.538
Go ask, like, to intern
for someone.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.584
Kinda sounds like you're basing
your decision off of

09:44.584 --> 09:47.456
only people that are saying,
"Don't go to college."

09:47.456 --> 09:49.284
Maybe on the internet,

09:49.284 --> 09:52.287
listen to people
that are enjoying college.

09:52.287 --> 09:56.204
Jack started Fresh Wolf
three years ago

09:56.204 --> 09:59.424
with the help
from John and myself.

09:59.424 --> 10:01.296
And it's going great.
He's doing amazing.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.994
Yeah, do that in from
that shoulder. There you go.

10:03.994 --> 10:07.171
But that doesn't mean that
Jack gets to jump

10:07.171 --> 10:10.000
into Bill Gates mode
and skip college

10:10.000 --> 10:11.959
and go back and get
an honorary degree.

10:11.959 --> 10:14.962
He's not skipping stages
in his life

10:14.962 --> 10:18.487
because John and I
were willing to help him.

10:18.487 --> 10:21.055
I think for me, too, Jack,
college wasn't just about

10:21.055 --> 10:23.274
what I learned
in physical science or math.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.146
It was about figuring out
how to live on my own.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.061
Like, I didn't grow up
with a mom that cooked.

10:27.061 --> 10:31.413
I didn't ever learn how to cook.

10:33.371 --> 10:37.071
Honest question, have I pushed
you too hard into doing stuff

10:37.071 --> 10:39.900
where you're doing it because
you feel like you have to

10:39.900 --> 10:42.163
and not that you want to?
And, like--

10:42.163 --> 10:43.730
Are we forcing to grow up
too fast?

10:43.730 --> 10:46.820
Yeah, did we force you
to grow up too fast?

10:46.820 --> 10:48.430
No, I wanna get working for me

10:48.430 --> 10:50.693
'cause I wanna be successful
on my own...

10:50.693 --> 10:52.564
- Okay.
- ...without people saying, like,

10:52.564 --> 10:53.696
"Daddy's money."
- Okay.

10:53.696 --> 10:55.263
So...

10:57.395 --> 10:59.093
So...

11:05.577 --> 11:09.451
Listen, do I want him to say,
"Yes, I'm going to college"?

11:09.451 --> 11:11.366
and, like, sign
his acceptance letter? 100%.

11:11.366 --> 11:13.716
But am I happy
with the baby steps?

11:13.716 --> 11:17.111
Yeah, because they're good steps
in the right direction.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.765
I'll take what I can get
right now.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.984
- Do you wanna go grab some food?
- Yeah.

11:20.984 --> 11:23.465
Okay. 'Cause you know I'm not
gonna make it for you.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.825
You want to go down?

11:38.393 --> 11:40.830
Hey, babe.

11:40.830 --> 11:43.224
Are you okay?

11:43.224 --> 11:45.095
I, like,
literally have been bombarded

11:45.095 --> 11:49.360
by just text messages and emails

11:49.360 --> 11:51.754
and people wanting to know
what's going on,

11:51.754 --> 11:53.538
and so I'm trying to figure out

11:53.538 --> 11:56.454
how to do some type
of mass communication.

11:56.454 --> 11:59.066
- Like, people you worked with?
- Yeah.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.937
I mean, I think people
were given an answer,

12:00.937 --> 12:03.200
but they didn't get the answer
they wanted,

12:03.200 --> 12:05.507
so why not go to the source?

12:05.507 --> 12:07.248
It was a Monday.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.337
I was actually having
a really hard day.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.034
I had just dropped the kids off
at home,

12:11.034 --> 12:13.080
and I stayed in the car.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.691
Justin pulled up next to me.
He gets out of the car

12:15.691 --> 12:18.172
and comes to my window,
and I say, "I'm so overwhelmed.

12:18.172 --> 12:19.434
I have too much on my plate,

12:19.434 --> 12:22.872
and I need
to just take a break."

12:22.872 --> 12:25.919
He just looked at me, like,
in shock,

12:25.919 --> 12:30.445
and he just said,
"Well, I was just fired."

12:30.445 --> 12:34.797
I'll tell you what I wanna post,
and you can tell me

12:34.797 --> 12:37.147
your true feelings about this.

12:37.147 --> 12:40.150
I'm still in shock.
All I can think about is

12:40.150 --> 12:42.500
what does this mean?
What's gonna happen?

12:42.500 --> 12:45.852
I don't make as much
as Justin does.

12:45.852 --> 12:48.506
We are just barely
catching our breath

12:48.506 --> 12:52.206
from taking a huge risk
last year with Wild Rose Beauty.

12:52.206 --> 12:55.644
What about our house,
our lifestyle, kids' soccer,

12:55.644 --> 12:58.952
food, cars? Like, do I need
to sell all my purses?

12:58.952 --> 13:02.129
Like, what--what--
what does this mean?

13:02.129 --> 13:06.133
So I was just thinking
of doing a post that said,

13:06.133 --> 13:09.179
"In today's world, we are all
very well connected,

13:09.179 --> 13:12.617
and you chose me or I chose you
to be on this platform together,

13:12.617 --> 13:16.317
which means I believe you are
one of the good ones."

13:18.536 --> 13:20.364
Oh, it's real.

13:22.932 --> 13:26.327
"I will truly miss so much

13:26.327 --> 13:28.111
about these past seven years.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.635
They have been some
of the best years of my life.

13:30.635 --> 13:36.163
But have no doubt I will always
support, uplift, edify,

13:36.163 --> 13:40.863
and in the end,
choose my family first,"

13:40.863 --> 13:43.039
with three hearts.

13:43.039 --> 13:45.085
I don't know why
that was so hard.

13:45.085 --> 13:49.654
I think that's the first time
I've cried since...

13:51.700 --> 13:54.007
Since your dad died?

13:54.007 --> 13:56.226
It's been a while.

13:56.226 --> 13:58.272
I'm gonna get a paper towel.

14:01.014 --> 14:02.929
Do you think that gets
the point across?

14:02.929 --> 14:08.021
Like, just so I can stop
trying to handle

14:08.021 --> 14:10.240
these texts one after another
after another?

14:10.240 --> 14:13.548
Yeah, like, you led
the entire salesforce.

14:13.548 --> 14:17.334
Like, you... you were
everyone's everything there,

14:17.334 --> 14:21.034
and these people
are so shocked because

14:21.034 --> 14:22.687
they don't get why you're gone.

14:22.687 --> 14:26.039
Justin pretty much is like
the O.G. in his industry.

14:26.039 --> 14:29.259
He was the Chief Sales
and Marketing Officer

14:29.259 --> 14:30.957
of a publicly traded company

14:30.957 --> 14:33.176
that sold
personal care products.

14:33.176 --> 14:35.048
No one fires Justin.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.354
Like, he is the best
of the best.

14:37.354 --> 14:40.880
I knew that there was rumblings,
and I knew that there was talk,

14:40.880 --> 14:45.232
but the conversation itself
was still a pretty big shock.

14:45.232 --> 14:47.451
How did they position it?

14:47.451 --> 14:51.020
He said how much he appreciated
the work I had done,

14:51.020 --> 14:56.112
"but... with Whitney being
a public figure...

14:57.635 --> 15:00.247
"...I just didn't see how
we were gonna be able

15:00.247 --> 15:02.466
to make this continue to work."

15:05.643 --> 15:07.036
Really?

15:07.036 --> 15:11.040
Yeah, I mean, that was how
the conversation started.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.174
So... the fact that your wife
has a career

15:14.174 --> 15:19.962
and is successful,
you can no longer work here.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.270
This is everything to do
with them shaming me

15:23.270 --> 15:26.273
for what kind of "woman" I am.

15:26.273 --> 15:28.014
There was gonna be
a conflict of interest.

15:32.366 --> 15:35.021
It is normal to want to be
intimate with your husband.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.110
It feels like that final straw
was when

15:37.110 --> 15:38.981
we did the love as art.

15:38.981 --> 15:41.549
Ohh!

15:41.549 --> 15:44.073
Yeah, that could be cringey,
but, like,

15:44.073 --> 15:46.467
I'm freakin' proud of that.

15:46.467 --> 15:49.687
I feel like this is taking me
back to when I was, like, 18,

15:49.687 --> 15:51.951
being told,
"Well, if you're not a man..."

15:51.951 --> 15:54.649
- Right.
-"...you can't have it."

15:54.649 --> 15:57.565
And, like, I feel like you are
literally, like, asked

15:57.565 --> 15:59.828
to suppress your wife
or leave.

15:59.828 --> 16:02.222
It's starting to bring back
all of these reasons

16:02.222 --> 16:04.485
of, like, why I even wanted

16:04.485 --> 16:07.009
to leave the Mormon Church
in the first place,

16:07.009 --> 16:08.358
'cause women are less than,

16:08.358 --> 16:10.491
women should submit
to their husband.

16:10.491 --> 16:12.841
And so I'm really fighting
the feeling

16:12.841 --> 16:14.408
of feeling ashamed and guilty,

16:14.408 --> 16:17.324
'cause I have nothing
to feel guilty for.

16:17.324 --> 16:20.022
Taking a step back, like,
what this means is, like,

16:20.022 --> 16:25.636
we've lost... like, your income.

16:28.117 --> 16:30.163
Sh-- just got real.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.601
<i>Coming up...</i>

16:33.601 --> 16:36.212
Retweeting
Heather's father's obituary?

16:36.212 --> 16:39.085
I have every right
to defend myself.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.402
- Hi. Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

16:52.402 --> 16:57.146
Shelby, Mir, Logan,
time for our meeting.

16:57.146 --> 16:59.453
Hey, we're starting
our meeting.

16:59.453 --> 17:01.846
Grab a stool or a spot.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.066
Yeah, let's fill in that corner.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.285
I'm always astounded,

17:05.285 --> 17:06.764
like, at how many people
we have.

17:06.764 --> 17:09.289
I know. Every time, I'm like,
we only need four spots,

17:09.289 --> 17:10.768
and then we need more
and more and more chairs

17:10.768 --> 17:13.684
'cause we are growing
so rapidly.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.339
Business at Beauty Lab
has never been better.

17:16.339 --> 17:17.949
It's so weird to talk
about being

17:17.949 --> 17:20.343
a successful businessperson
because when I was growing up,

17:20.343 --> 17:23.172
being successful meant
having great kids,

17:23.172 --> 17:25.218
being a great wife,
being a great mother,

17:25.218 --> 17:26.828
and business was what you did

17:26.828 --> 17:28.830
if you couldn't do the other
things. You know?

17:28.830 --> 17:32.051
So I just wanted to address
second location.

17:32.051 --> 17:35.619
Um, we are running behind.
It sucks.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.100
We're looking at end of summer
if we're lucky.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.449
Mm-hmm.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.973
Which puts a lot of pressure
on you guys.

17:41.973 --> 17:44.628
Because we don't have
a second location yet

17:44.628 --> 17:46.195
to take the load off of that,

17:46.195 --> 17:47.718
we are gonna be extending
our hours.

17:47.718 --> 17:49.807
Beauty Lab is all about
immediate gratification,

17:49.807 --> 17:52.506
and if customers can't get in
within the next two weeks,

17:52.506 --> 17:54.247
they will find somewhere else
to get it.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.466
Botox waits for no man.

17:56.466 --> 17:59.034
We have clients starting
in, like, 10 minutes.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.644
- Um, we gotta go change.
- Yeah.

18:00.644 --> 18:02.646
And if I don't build
a second location,

18:02.646 --> 18:04.300
my business model will crumble.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.388
We are literally busting
out of the seams.

18:05.388 --> 18:07.825
I know. I know.

18:07.825 --> 18:09.523
It's so funny to me how
it's pivoted,

18:09.523 --> 18:11.220
'cause I felt like when they
first said there was a delay,

18:11.220 --> 18:13.353
I felt a huge relief

18:13.353 --> 18:15.398
because we have
so many other things going on.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.967
- I know. How are you doing?
- I'm... overwhelmed.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.142
Yeah.

18:20.142 --> 18:22.492
Why did I hope or want
for anything

18:22.492 --> 18:24.929
other than just
my sad existence?

18:26.757 --> 18:28.150
So many good things
have happened,

18:28.150 --> 18:31.110
but now I'm scared that we're
gonna lose it all.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.676
I'm... so stressed
about the book.

18:32.676 --> 18:35.679
What's the latest?
What's going on with that?

18:35.679 --> 18:38.378
Okay, so Steve will call me
probably every day,

18:38.378 --> 18:40.510
saying, "We are waiting.
We are waiting.

18:40.510 --> 18:41.903
We are waiting."
So I got an email last night.

18:41.903 --> 18:44.253
Steve said, "Literally,
you've been escalated,"

18:44.253 --> 18:46.864
because you've been
so unresponsive.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.997
<i>Honestly, we are in
a really critical point here,</i>

18:48.997 --> 18:51.695
<i>because you have missed
every deadline.</i>

18:51.695 --> 18:55.699
<i>I'm having to apologize for you
every day.</i>

18:55.699 --> 18:58.180
<i>They get to the point where they
may just wanna pull the plug.</i>

19:00.182 --> 19:02.837
I wanted this so bad, and I put
all my heart and soul into it,

19:02.837 --> 19:03.707
and now that it's really, like,
around the corner,

19:03.707 --> 19:07.407
I feel paralyzed.

19:07.407 --> 19:09.365
Writing this book
has been so much harder

19:09.365 --> 19:11.106
than I ever anticipated.

19:11.106 --> 19:12.368
Everything will be written,

19:12.368 --> 19:13.891
and I'll be ready to submit it
to my editor,

19:13.891 --> 19:16.242
and then I'll have
a crisis of conscience,

19:16.242 --> 19:17.808
and I'll be like,
"I have to take this out.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.767
I can't put that in. My parents
will never forgive me."

19:19.767 --> 19:22.509
And then I backtrack
and try to soften it.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.727
And then when I read it softened,

19:23.727 --> 19:26.774
it feels like I'm being fake,

19:26.774 --> 19:27.818
and so then I go back
to the drawing board.

19:27.818 --> 19:31.300
It's hard to be
your own advocate

19:31.300 --> 19:34.173
and a traitor
at the same time.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.654
A couple weeks ago,
I was so hopeful

19:37.654 --> 19:40.744
that I could not identify
as Mormon...

19:40.744 --> 19:43.573
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and still have my family.

19:43.573 --> 19:46.750
Having my cousins show up
to ski with me and my friends

19:46.750 --> 19:50.232
felt like they were embracing
my new identity...

19:50.232 --> 19:52.626
- It was a win.
- ...and my new life.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.019
- Hi. Hi, Dre.
- This is my cousin Morgan.

19:55.019 --> 19:58.153
I think you guys have met.
Hi. How are you?

19:58.153 --> 19:59.894
- Good.
- Thanks for coming.

19:59.894 --> 20:05.900
And then last night,
Lisa tweeted my dad's obituary

20:05.900 --> 20:11.253
as a way to, like, prove
how great of a friend she is

20:11.253 --> 20:13.603
because she texted me

20:13.603 --> 20:15.736
when we brought my dad
home from the hospital to die.

20:15.736 --> 20:16.911
Yeah.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.043
While we were gathered
by his bedside,

20:19.043 --> 20:21.872
Lisa texted me, "I hope
your dad's feeling better."

20:21.872 --> 20:23.352
When we were in L.A.,
I made a comment

20:23.352 --> 20:26.486
that Lisa had not been
supportive when my dad passed.

20:26.486 --> 20:28.749
My dad had passed,
and she texted me and said,

20:28.749 --> 20:30.620
"I hope
your dad's feeling better."

20:30.620 --> 20:32.883
- No, I did not say that.
- After he died?

20:32.883 --> 20:33.971
Yeah.

20:33.971 --> 20:35.712
She went back,
looked at her texts,

20:35.712 --> 20:38.149
and realized that her text
was sent before my dad died

20:38.149 --> 20:41.065
and that she was right,
and she wanted to be vindicated.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.372
But what she's missing is that
my dad was on hospice

20:43.372 --> 20:45.635
and was surrounded
by his family,

20:45.635 --> 20:48.943
taking his last breaths
on earth,

20:48.943 --> 20:50.640
and I got a text from her saying,

20:50.640 --> 20:52.512
"Hope your dad's
feeling better."

20:52.512 --> 20:54.296
To have her weaponize that
to hurt me

20:54.296 --> 20:56.733
and to prove
that she's always right--

20:56.733 --> 21:03.000
it... just... made me lose faith
and any hope

21:03.000 --> 21:04.785
for a real friendship
with her.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.004
I get a text from my cousin saying,

21:07.004 --> 21:11.313
"I do not want my life exposed.
I do not wanna be a part

21:11.313 --> 21:14.142
of this kind of, like,
weird ugliness."

21:16.231 --> 21:20.061
I feel like
it ruined any chance I had...

21:20.061 --> 21:21.497
Yeah.

21:21.497 --> 21:23.194
...of my family being supportive
of me being public

21:23.194 --> 21:25.327
about our story in this book.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.851
Not only did it destroy

21:27.851 --> 21:29.810
the progress that you were
making with your family,

21:29.810 --> 21:31.464
but it destroyed
your guys' friendship.

21:31.464 --> 21:34.641
Lisa Barlow only cares
about Lisa Barlow.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.426
You know, Lisa and I have been
taking baby steps

21:37.426 --> 21:38.949
towards forming a friendship,

21:38.949 --> 21:41.082
and I wanted her to be
a part of the choir.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.782
- Do you wanna be in my choir?
- Yeah.

21:45.782 --> 21:48.785
You have to audition.
It's gonna be skill-based.

21:48.785 --> 21:51.048
I think I can sing.

21:51.048 --> 21:55.052
Now I'm like, dreading the fact
that she might show up.

21:55.052 --> 21:59.622
I hope that her being right
in this moment

21:59.622 --> 22:01.755
is worth it to her,

22:01.755 --> 22:06.368
because I feel like
she's lost me forever.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.808
<i>Coming up...</i>

22:11.808 --> 22:14.637
- Oh, here we go!
- She's ready.

22:14.637 --> 22:18.162
I was expecting "American Idol,"
okay?

22:18.162 --> 22:19.729
There's five people,

22:19.729 --> 22:24.081
and four of them
are, like, related to Heather.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.660
Hi. Welcome to Mindful Living.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.358
I'm here
for Erica's private class.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.316
Perfect.
Missy will show you down.

22:41.316 --> 22:43.405
All right. Thank you.

22:46.277 --> 22:47.714
- Hi!
- Are you Erica?

22:47.714 --> 22:49.672
I am, Whitney.
It's so nice to meet you.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.153
- Are you a hugger?
- Yeah, I'm a hugger.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.459
Hey. How's it going?

22:53.459 --> 22:55.286
- Hi, Lisa.
- Good to see you.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.592
You as well. This is Erica.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.594
- Hi, Lisa.
- Hi, Erica. Nice to meet you.

22:58.594 --> 22:59.856
Nice to meet you.
Let me show you...

22:59.856 --> 23:01.118
A mat?

23:01.118 --> 23:02.816
...where you can put you stuff
real quick.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.383
- Okay. Perfect.
- And then we'll get you set up.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.471
- Can I take that?
- Thank you. Yeah.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.515
What about my shoes?
In here, too?

23:06.515 --> 23:07.647
- Yep. Perfect.
- Okay.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.126
Oh, I'm gonna lose
a few inches.

23:09.126 --> 23:10.780
I know nothing about that.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.695
At least I make up for what
God forgot, right?

23:12.695 --> 23:16.264
So, gals, this class is, like,
really chill.

23:16.264 --> 23:19.441
We'll listen to our breath,
certainly move the hips.

23:19.441 --> 23:23.314
- Mine are off. Like, they hurt.
- Let's get into that, then.

23:23.314 --> 23:26.883
Whitney and I have a history
of doing yoga together.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.843
Oh, my gosh. That's amazing.

23:29.843 --> 23:31.366
- Aah!
- Right foot behind.

23:31.366 --> 23:32.715
- Whoa.
- Aah!

23:34.108 --> 23:35.805
Honestly,
I wish she'd say, like,

23:35.805 --> 23:39.287
"Let's go shopping
or fine dining."

23:39.287 --> 23:42.464
I mean, even driving through
Taco Bell would be better.

23:42.464 --> 23:47.643
Go ahead and roll out that hip.
So beautiful, Whitney.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.298
- Is this right?
- Yeah.

23:50.298 --> 23:54.389
And then we'll bring everything
back to tabletop.

23:54.389 --> 23:56.870
Beautiful, Whitney.

23:56.870 --> 24:00.047
Bring your right arm
all the way up.

24:00.047 --> 24:02.789
And then come into
that thread the needle.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.531
Is that right? It feels weird.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.707
Beautiful, Whitney.

24:07.707 --> 24:10.710
Come all the way down.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.408
Exhale. Hands come to heart.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.065
- So lovely.
- Thank you.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.110
- Thank you, Erica.
- You are so welcome.

24:21.938 --> 24:25.028
Absolutely. This is space
is yours, so take your time.

24:25.028 --> 24:28.554
- Thanks for inviting me.
- Yeah. Thanks for coming.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.077
So what's going on with you?

24:30.077 --> 24:36.083
Um, Justin has decided to, like,
he--he left his company.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.172
Was that, like,
was that a choice he made

24:38.172 --> 24:40.217
because you wanted him
to make it?

24:40.217 --> 24:42.176
- Uh, no.
- No?

24:42.176 --> 24:46.659
No. It was a choice
that he was... faced with.

24:46.659 --> 24:48.443
- Oh.
- Um...

24:48.443 --> 24:50.880
Like...

24:50.880 --> 24:53.143
I mean, I can't dive
into the details of it.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.276
Got it.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.583
Justin being fired
is all over social media.

25:01.238 --> 25:02.892
I'm kinda staying mum
in this situation

25:02.892 --> 25:06.069
because Whitney doesn't need
somebody else telling her

25:06.069 --> 25:08.332
what she should
or should not have done.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.379
Whitney needs someone to,
like, encourage her,

25:11.379 --> 25:12.728
to, like, move forward.

25:12.728 --> 25:15.949
I'm not seeing this
as the glass half empty.

25:15.949 --> 25:17.733
I think it's an opportunity
for them.

25:17.733 --> 25:21.563
But it has been a hard week.
It's been very, very hard week.

25:21.563 --> 25:25.393
I mean, he's had a corporate
9-to-5 job his entire life.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.743
Yeah. I'm not living through it
like you guys are,

25:27.743 --> 25:29.397
but I can honestly say, like,

25:29.397 --> 25:31.138
some of the hardest challenges
I've had,

25:31.138 --> 25:33.053
like, a lot of blessings
come from that.

25:33.053 --> 25:37.623
It's been hard, but Justin and I
made a commitment to each other

25:37.623 --> 25:40.147
that we're gonna focus
on the positive,

25:40.147 --> 25:42.018
and the positive here is that

25:42.018 --> 25:46.762
my husband was released
from a company...

25:46.762 --> 25:48.764
that is sh--.

25:48.764 --> 25:50.287
I think you guys are gonna be
just fine.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.506
It is change,
and I'm sure it's gonna be

25:51.506 --> 25:53.334
an emotional roller coaster.

25:53.334 --> 25:54.857
But I think it's gonna be
a good one.

25:54.857 --> 25:58.252
Yeah. So what's new
in your world?

25:58.252 --> 26:01.211
Um... oh, my gosh.
So I've had a crazy week.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.170
I started, like,
getting a lot of,

26:03.170 --> 26:05.041
like, negativity
coming at me,

26:05.041 --> 26:07.522
because Heather lied about me
in L.A.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.611
People say,
"Oh, you're a horrible person,"

26:09.611 --> 26:11.526
and "You're...
how disgusting are you?"

26:11.526 --> 26:14.311
But retweeting
Heather's father's obituary--

26:14.311 --> 26:17.445
I just wanna understand
why you feel like

26:17.445 --> 26:18.838
you gotta prove a lie.
Like, where is the lie?

26:18.838 --> 26:20.187
What's the lie?

26:20.187 --> 26:22.015
Yeah.
That's what I'm confused on.

26:22.015 --> 26:25.540
She lied and said
that after her dad died,

26:25.540 --> 26:27.760
I sent her a message that said,

26:27.760 --> 26:29.849
"I hope your dad's
feeling better."

26:29.849 --> 26:31.938
That's 100% a lie.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.548
I've let a lot of things go.

26:33.548 --> 26:36.856
I just had a little conversation
with Danna and Jen.

26:36.856 --> 26:40.773
They're like, "Why did you
invite Angie H.?"

26:40.773 --> 26:43.297
I didn't even think about you
or consider you,

26:43.297 --> 26:45.299
and I am sorry for that.

26:45.299 --> 26:47.606
I want you to know, like,
I would never do that to you.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.651
This I couldn't let go,
because it was like kinda like

26:49.651 --> 26:52.611
the cherry on the icing on
the topping of the cake for me.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.134
I'm not looking to go backwards
with Heather.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.440
I'm just looking to set
the record straight.

26:56.440 --> 26:59.443
Like, I have every right
to defend myself.

26:59.443 --> 27:03.012
You do. But it's also fair
to say that

27:03.012 --> 27:05.449
to an extent of not going
below the belt.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.495
Did I go about it the wrong way?
100%.

27:07.495 --> 27:10.324
I should've picked up the phone
and called her.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.892
But the intention wasn't
to hurt her back.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.198
The intention was to clear
my name.

27:15.198 --> 27:17.853
You should probably still
pick up the phone and call her.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.726
Well, I think I'm just gonna
show up at her choir auditions.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.556
Lisa showing up could really
only go one or two ways.

27:25.556 --> 27:29.386
It could turn into a sh-- storm
and everything starts on fire

27:29.386 --> 27:31.258
and burns to the ground,

27:31.258 --> 27:34.565
or we could be holding hands,
singing "Kumbaya."

27:34.565 --> 27:37.612
I would bet that we're about
to have a dumpster fire.

27:37.612 --> 27:40.136
At the end of the day, I wanna--
to feel supportive,

27:40.136 --> 27:42.704
and I'm just gonna keep
that mindset.

27:42.704 --> 27:46.665
And she might kick me out,
but I'm still going.

27:46.665 --> 27:48.754
That's why I'm biting my lip.

28:01.375 --> 28:03.638
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

28:06.989 --> 28:08.687
Hey, how are you?

28:08.687 --> 28:09.949
Do you have reservations
tonight?

28:09.949 --> 28:11.864
- We do. It's under Marks.
- Great to see you.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.735
We've got that table
all ready for you.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.476
Just follow me right this way.

28:15.476 --> 28:17.608
Here they are.

28:20.002 --> 28:21.787
Hello! You look gorgeous.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.137
Thank you. So do you.
How are you?

28:24.137 --> 28:27.009
Oh, my goodness. Look at you.
How are you?

28:27.009 --> 28:29.446
I'm good. How are you?

28:29.446 --> 28:31.535
Thank you, dear.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.189
- How's it going?
- Great.

28:33.189 --> 28:34.887
My name's Chase. I'll be taking
care of you this evening.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.889
Is there anything we can get you
started on with at the moment?

28:36.889 --> 28:38.717
Um, I'll have
a Belvedere on the rocks

28:38.717 --> 28:41.023
with a splash of soda.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.156
I've always liked Angie.
I don't know her that well,

28:43.156 --> 28:45.680
but I've always had fun
with her.

28:45.680 --> 28:47.377
What's a great tequila cocktail?

28:47.377 --> 28:49.945
Really, but for Lisa,
I would have probably

28:49.945 --> 28:51.991
already been friends with Angie.

28:51.991 --> 28:54.167
I just gave Lisa the space
that she wanted

28:54.167 --> 28:55.646
in her friendships,

28:55.646 --> 28:57.997
so I'm not worrying
about Lisa Barlow anymore.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.172
She clearly doesn't worry
about me,

28:59.172 --> 29:02.218
so I'm not worrying about her.

29:02.218 --> 29:03.785
Do we all wanna share
a bunch of bites?

29:03.785 --> 29:05.178
- Yeah.
- Sure, yeah.

29:05.178 --> 29:06.745
Then why don't we try
the chicken and dumplings...

29:06.745 --> 29:08.007
- Okay.
- ...since you love that?

29:08.007 --> 29:09.269
The beef tenderloin,
it's Prime grade.

29:09.269 --> 29:10.574
- We can do that sliced to order.
- Sure, yeah.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.011
We're doing shared for
all around?

29:12.011 --> 29:13.490
- Deal.
- Done.

29:13.490 --> 29:15.188
You have a good day?

29:15.188 --> 29:17.668
We ditched the baby.

29:17.668 --> 29:19.366
But it's, like, weird to have
a toddler, and he's 52,

29:19.366 --> 29:22.543
and I'm, like, 40,
and we love it.

29:22.543 --> 29:24.414
It's the best thing
that ever happened.

29:24.414 --> 29:28.201
But the minute we get
a babysitter, we're like...

29:28.201 --> 29:29.637
- Out the door.
- ...we're outta here.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.334
Well, yeah.

29:35.077 --> 29:36.557
Did you have a fun time
at skiing?

29:36.557 --> 29:39.038
- I had such a great day.
- I had a great time with you.

29:39.038 --> 29:40.735
It was good to get to
know you better.

29:40.735 --> 29:41.954
Yeah.

29:41.954 --> 29:43.782
I think the only damper
was with Lisa.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.914
She wants nothing to do with me.

29:45.914 --> 29:47.524
You know, Meredith and I--

29:47.524 --> 29:49.570
I think we're
a little trauma-bonded.

29:49.570 --> 29:52.007
I think we've both been
on the receiving end

29:52.007 --> 29:54.053
of Lisa Barlow's wrath.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.229
Sometimes when you go
through emotional things

29:56.229 --> 29:57.883
or a friendship breakup,
you kind of have common ground,

29:57.883 --> 30:01.408
and it kinda draws you closer.

30:01.408 --> 30:03.236
I'm very willing to hear
what she says

30:03.236 --> 30:05.673
about all the "lies" I've said.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.241
I've never said she's done
sexual favors

30:08.241 --> 30:11.113
for a loan or Jazz tickets.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.941
I'm frustrated
I got dragged into this.

30:12.941 --> 30:18.338
However, Whitney and I have,
in private, discussed rumors.

30:18.338 --> 30:21.297
I think we interpret things
a little bit differently,

30:21.297 --> 30:22.908
and maybe there was a comment
of, like,

30:22.908 --> 30:25.606
"Oh, that person invested
in Vida."

30:25.606 --> 30:29.740
But there was never...
"for sexual favors."

30:29.740 --> 30:32.656
Like... I wouldn't say that.

30:32.656 --> 30:36.573
So the last time I see at John
was at the Jazz game.

30:36.573 --> 30:38.880
When I walk up and he's just--
he's just sitting, and he goes,

30:38.880 --> 30:40.229
"Get the [bleep] away from me."

30:40.229 --> 30:41.883
And I'm like,
"John, are you serious?"

30:41.883 --> 30:44.320
He goes, "Yeah."

30:44.320 --> 30:45.626
I don't know what happened,
so--

30:45.626 --> 30:47.497
- So out of character.
- I just felt so out of--

30:47.497 --> 30:49.325
It's shocking. That doesn't
sound like him at all.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.110
I-I'm at a loss for words.

30:51.110 --> 30:52.807
Do you think
it could've been fueled

30:52.807 --> 30:56.332
by what happened on Instagram?

30:56.332 --> 31:00.119
Chris got really frustrated
because he felt like

31:00.119 --> 31:02.730
I was being attacked
in the media.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.950
A lot of it felt like
it was coming from Lisa.

31:04.950 --> 31:08.692
And we were getting accounts
that were saying things

31:08.692 --> 31:11.695
that only I had talked
to her about.

31:11.695 --> 31:13.480
In a very immature moment...

31:13.480 --> 31:17.092
as a 52-year-old man,

31:17.092 --> 31:18.833
please judge me later, but...

31:18.833 --> 31:20.487
I created a fake account.

31:31.411 --> 31:34.501
Chris got really frustrated
because he felt like

31:34.501 --> 31:37.199
I was being attacked
in the media.

31:37.199 --> 31:40.463
A lot of it felt like
it was coming from Lisa.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.944
In a very immature moment,

31:42.944 --> 31:45.207
as a 52-year-old man,

31:45.207 --> 31:46.948
I created a fake account.

31:49.951 --> 31:52.562
Well, there's no manual
to defending your wife

31:52.562 --> 31:54.521
on social media.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.741
But that's understandable.

31:57.741 --> 32:01.310
Like, trying to defend your wife
whatever way you can.

32:01.310 --> 32:02.964
- And I've matured since then.
- Stand up and...

32:02.964 --> 32:08.927
Okay. So yes... I do think it's--
it's, you know, not great

32:08.927 --> 32:11.364
that you made this account
and whatever else,

32:11.364 --> 32:14.236
but I have been sent
certain things that tells me

32:14.236 --> 32:17.196
that Lisa has been doing
the same thing.

32:17.196 --> 32:20.590
So at the end of the day,
forget it.

32:20.590 --> 32:24.116
- You know? And move on.
- Thank you.

32:24.116 --> 32:26.074
Look, um, it's--
it's embarrassing,

32:26.074 --> 32:27.597
but, uh, you know, I'm--
I own it.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.077
- It's--you're living your truth.
- Exactly.

32:29.077 --> 32:30.383
A least you're owning up
to it...

32:30.383 --> 32:31.558
- I did it.
- ...and moving on.

32:31.558 --> 32:35.692
- Yeah. Yeah.
- And that's that.

32:46.138 --> 32:49.097
Um, I don't know how
to open this.

32:53.319 --> 32:56.278
What kind of bottle is this?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.503
Hello. I come in peace.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.290
- What's up?
- Hey.

33:08.290 --> 33:09.552
- Mwah.
- Mm.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.293
Okay.

33:11.293 --> 33:13.992
So I threw a birthday party
for a 5-year-old,

33:13.992 --> 33:15.732
and the theme was aliens.

33:15.732 --> 33:17.038
Really?

33:17.038 --> 33:19.127
You know, you're one heck
of a party thrower.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.781
Look what I was

33:20.781 --> 33:22.478
just trying to figure out
how to open.

33:22.478 --> 33:24.045
- Is it screw top?
- Yes.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.177
Mama's got you.

33:25.177 --> 33:27.440
- Okay, I'm gonna get us glasses.
- Yeah.

33:27.440 --> 33:30.095
Oh, it's like
a tequila bottle cork. Whoo!

33:32.314 --> 33:34.751
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

33:34.751 --> 33:36.579
Sunny and bright Chanel.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.494
Do you have a, um, butler
on hand?

33:38.494 --> 33:40.801
Mr. Belvedere?

33:40.801 --> 33:43.499
My jacket needs hanging.

33:43.499 --> 33:47.808
This is not even the appropriate
body type of an alien. Okay?

33:47.808 --> 33:49.810
Well, they're
alien light-up balloons.

33:49.810 --> 33:52.073
This is like
alien body positivity.

33:52.073 --> 33:53.335
Wait. Where's my phone?

33:53.335 --> 33:55.642
Your phone is on the table
in there.

33:55.642 --> 33:58.123
- Okay. So...
- Wait. Hand me my alien friend.

33:58.123 --> 34:01.387
I'm gonna see where his, uh,
inflatable... thing is.

34:01.387 --> 34:02.518
'Cause I always think
about that.

34:02.518 --> 34:04.303
The other alien's--

34:04.303 --> 34:05.782
When the manufacturers
make these,

34:05.782 --> 34:07.523
where do they put
the blow-up part?

34:07.523 --> 34:09.308
Because it's for kids.

34:09.308 --> 34:10.961
- Oh, the back of the head.
- Oh, nice.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.703
So that's gotta be the least
inappropriate part of the body.

34:13.703 --> 34:15.096
- The back of the head.
- So... yes.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.576
Just for kids--

34:16.576 --> 34:18.099
So they're not blowing up
down there like a blowjob.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.579
- Well, I mean...
- Yeah.

34:19.579 --> 34:22.625
Well, Lisa would know
more than me.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.366
So anyway,

34:24.366 --> 34:26.542
I know you have auditions tomorrow,

34:26.542 --> 34:27.891
so I probably
need to tell you this.

34:27.891 --> 34:31.330
I kinda just, like,
pushed it to the side.

34:31.330 --> 34:34.376
Chris Harrington...

34:34.376 --> 34:38.250
started an Instagram page
called @shahxposed.

34:42.471 --> 34:46.214
Babe, that's a big----ing deal.

34:47.998 --> 34:51.263
So @shahxposed has been
out there, like,

34:51.263 --> 34:54.004
trolling accounts,
saying sh-- about me.

34:54.004 --> 34:57.791
It said, "Influenced
the cancelation of the caterer,

34:57.791 --> 35:02.230
tried to cancel the charity
from participating through Jen,"

35:02.230 --> 35:04.928
and I'm like, you--
no, I didn't.

35:04.928 --> 35:08.062
So anyway, I never told you.
I never involved you.

35:08.062 --> 35:09.803
I didn't wanna put this
on your brain or your heart

35:09.803 --> 35:12.893
or your head
or worry you about it.

35:12.893 --> 35:15.287
I dealt all--with all this
by myself.

35:15.287 --> 35:18.551
I also--I didn't believe, 'cause
it first came to me from Lisa,

35:18.551 --> 35:20.074
and I didn't believe her.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.641
Yeah, 'cause I can't believe it.

35:21.641 --> 35:24.122
So I brought it up to her,
and I said, "Angie,

35:24.122 --> 35:27.212
I need to let you know
Lisa had said this."

35:27.212 --> 35:30.824
She goes, "Oh, that's not true."
And I said, "Okay."

35:30.824 --> 35:33.479
Next thing I know, I'm getting
a phone call from somebody.

35:33.479 --> 35:35.524
It's Chris Harrington.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.660
And he's like, "I did set up
the account called @shahxposed,

35:40.660 --> 35:42.792
and I'm really sorry."

35:46.013 --> 35:47.797
And I'm like, "Why did you
name it @shahxposed?"

35:47.797 --> 35:49.190
I asked him that.

35:49.190 --> 35:50.409
- I go, "But why--why me?"
- Yeah.

35:50.409 --> 35:51.801
-"What did I do?"
- Yeah, and what'd he say?

35:51.801 --> 35:53.760
"Well, it was available,
so I took the name."

35:57.285 --> 36:00.114
Really? You couldn't do
"Lisa Barlow Exposed"?

36:00.114 --> 36:01.246
Like, what the [bleep] did I do?

36:01.246 --> 36:02.682
- Why are you coming after me?
- Yeah.

36:02.682 --> 36:04.901
When Chris apologized,

36:04.901 --> 36:07.513
it wasn't so much
that I accepted his apology.

36:07.513 --> 36:09.732
I was literally in shock.

36:09.732 --> 36:13.040
This is not just some troll
online that I don't know.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.129
Like, this is somebody
I'm talking to,

36:15.129 --> 36:18.001
and to know that they were
on the other side

36:18.001 --> 36:21.788
doing something to try to harm
me and my family--

36:21.788 --> 36:24.312
I-I have a really hard time
with it.

36:24.312 --> 36:27.010
- I need you to know because...
- I'm glad you're telling me.

36:27.010 --> 36:30.275
...you need to know.
This was super hurtful to me,

36:30.275 --> 36:33.669
'cause this was--thinking of
everything going on, right,

36:33.669 --> 36:35.062
with me and my family...
- Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.803
...and my situation.

36:36.803 --> 36:39.153
I feel like when it comes
to Angie,

36:39.153 --> 36:41.373
you need to also be a little bit
more aware of what's going on.

36:41.373 --> 36:44.158
I do. I absolutely do, obviously.

36:46.595 --> 36:49.946
How are you gonna handle it?

36:49.946 --> 36:52.906
- Like, what are you gonna do?
- What are <i>you</i> gonna do?

36:52.906 --> 36:55.561
I don't wanna be
in this position,

36:55.561 --> 37:01.262
because it's indefensible,
and... at the same time,

37:01.262 --> 37:03.699
I have really developed
a strong friendship

37:03.699 --> 37:06.311
with Chris and Angie,
and I feel devastated.

37:06.311 --> 37:11.881
I do not wanna be in the middle
of a battle between these two.

37:11.881 --> 37:17.191
If it's any... consolation,
she knows how much I love you,

37:17.191 --> 37:19.324
and that's probably made her
afraid to tell me.

37:19.324 --> 37:20.716
Yeah.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.849
Because I don't know
what that's gonna mean.

37:22.849 --> 37:25.939
I-I do not know what
that's gonna mean.

37:42.521 --> 37:45.001
Hey, how's everything looking?

37:45.001 --> 37:47.569
<i>Uh, it looks really good.
Yeah, we got everything set up.</i>

37:47.569 --> 37:49.702
Oh, awesome.
And the theater looks good?

37:49.702 --> 37:51.225
<i>Looks fantastic.</i>

37:51.225 --> 37:53.662
Okay, perfect. I'll see you

Michael McLean.

James is my friend

39:28.975 --> 39:31.717
and a singer/songwriter with
an impeccable ear for talent.

39:31.717 --> 39:33.719
Oh, my gosh.
How are you, Heather?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.677
Paisley was a finalist
for "American Idol."

39:35.677 --> 39:37.723
I mean, this is a panel
of experts

39:37.723 --> 39:40.508

for my choir.

Oh, yeah.

- What's up, girl?
- Well, hello.

39:46.296 --> 39:49.343
What's going on here?

39:49.343 --> 39:50.779
Are you ready to sing?

39:50.779 --> 39:55.175
Oh, I'm not singing.
I'm a judge.

39:55.175 --> 39:57.395
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.571
- Oh, she's gonna judge us.
- Oh, here we go!

39:59.571 --> 40:02.225
She's ready.

40:02.225 --> 40:04.880
I was expecting "American Idol,"
okay?

40:04.880 --> 40:07.448
There's five people,

40:07.448 --> 40:12.410
and four of them are, like,
related to Heather.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.846
Okay?

40:13.846 --> 40:17.240
Somebody looks like
they're in my color.

I need--You're Ryan Seacrest
in this deal. I need you--

40:59.631 --> 41:02.851
Hype control?
I thought I was a judge.

41:02.851 --> 41:04.636
Is Ryan Seacrest a judge,

41:04.636 --> 41:09.379
or is he the star
of "American Idol"?

41:09.379 --> 41:11.556
And does Ryan Seacrest
get anywhere

41:11.556 --> 41:14.820
without a very well-poised,
discreet assistant?

41:14.820 --> 41:16.430
- No, he does not.
- No. No.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.127
And that is why
Ms. Meredith Marks--

41:18.127 --> 41:19.868
Are you telling me
to be the assistant?

41:19.868 --> 41:21.435
No, no, you are--

41:21.435 --> 41:23.568
Now I went from judge
to assistant?!

41:23.568 --> 41:26.484
I mean, demoted already?

41:26.484 --> 41:28.616
Don't disappoint us,
Meredith. You've got this.

41:28.616 --> 41:30.792
I'm doing my best.
Is this working?

41:32.490 --> 41:35.014
The assistant
needs some assistance, please.

41:35.014 --> 41:39.888
Hello, everyone!

41:39.888 --> 41:43.588
Who's ready to audition?!

41:44.545 --> 41:45.720
- Ready!
- Yes.

41:48.854 --> 41:51.160
The last thing I expected today

41:51.160 --> 41:54.207
was to see
Angie Harrington here,

41:54.207 --> 41:56.862
especially after my conversation
with Heather.

41:56.862 --> 42:00.213
You guys, be right back!

42:01.693 --> 42:04.696
Somebody missed the memo, apparently.

42:09.004 --> 42:12.573
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

42:14.140 --> 42:18.144
<i>Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

42:18.144 --> 42:20.755
So Brooksy is coming out
to visit.

42:20.755 --> 42:24.063
Can you not put your foot
near my tank?

42:24.063 --> 42:26.587
I'm here for the audition!

42:26.587 --> 42:28.894
I'm telling you the truth.
I don't----ing lie.

42:28.894 --> 42:30.635
The truth is you have
no friends left.

42:30.635 --> 42:32.288
Whoo!

42:32.288 --> 42:34.769
You wanna know the sh-- I have
been taking for no reason?

42:34.769 --> 42:36.554
Because of @shahxposed?

42:36.554 --> 42:37.816
That's your husband!

42:37.816 --> 42:39.339
The thing
you're being accused of,

42:39.339 --> 42:40.949
is Sharrieff taking sh--
for it?

42:40.949 --> 42:42.472
I'm innocent!

42:43.648 --> 42:45.084
Don't----ing laugh or smile!

42:45.084 --> 42:46.738
Do you know my husband
to be a bad guy?

42:46.738 --> 42:48.827
No. No.

42:48.827 --> 42:50.524
Which straw breaks
the camel's back?

42:50.524 --> 42:52.744
Which insult causes you
to do something

42:52.744 --> 42:54.267
that you can't come back from?

42:54.267 --> 42:56.922
I'm just----ing with Angie
because she thinks

42:56.922 --> 42:58.837
her fat----ing
Elf on the Shelf husband

42:58.837 --> 43:01.448
is gonna put you
on a----ing yacht, bitch.

43:01.448 --> 43:03.493
I am done. Goodbye.
