(static)

00:50.881 --> 00:54.281
(faint dispatch chatter)

00:59.241 --> 01:02.081
(electric static)

01:04.321 --> 01:07.001
(deep growling)

01:10.041 --> 01:12.121
(static)

01:14.161 --> 01:15.561
- It was more than a symbol.

01:15.561 --> 01:18.921
This was actually of our own creation.

01:18.921 --> 01:21.081
(howling)

01:23.601 --> 01:25.881
(beeping)

01:25.881 --> 01:27.961
It is really true that
you can only explore

01:27.961 --> 01:32.081
the solar system for the first time once.

01:32.081 --> 01:33.321
Voyager did that.

01:33.321 --> 01:36.241
(loud screeching)

01:36.241 --> 01:38.441
- How could one be so lucky?

01:38.441 --> 01:40.921
It's a dream and it came true.

01:41.841 --> 01:44.521
(loud instrumental music)

01:44.521 --> 01:45.881
- 50 years from now,

01:45.881 --> 01:49.121
Voyager will be the science project

01:49.121 --> 01:51.001
of the 20th century.

01:51.001 --> 01:51.801
The mission.

01:51.801 --> 01:52.881
The big mission.

01:52.881 --> 01:56.561
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:57.841 --> 01:59.481
- We didn't imagine big enough

01:59.481 --> 02:01.961
and it opened our eyes to worlds,

02:01.961 --> 02:03.081
to real worlds.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.601
(slow instrumental music)

02:09.681 --> 02:13.361
(speaking foreign language)

02:15.081 --> 02:17.841
(monkeys whooping)

02:17.841 --> 02:20.721
- It was an unworldly
experience to fly through that

02:20.721 --> 02:23.081
small little window of space and time.

02:23.081 --> 02:24.641
It was absolutely astonishing that we

02:24.641 --> 02:26.121
were able to pull that off.

02:26.121 --> 02:29.801
(speaking foreign language)

02:31.121 --> 02:32.881
(crying baby)

02:32.881 --> 02:33.921
- [Narrator] Oh come on now.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.921
- We created an artificially
intelligent spacecraft

02:36.921 --> 02:38.881
that we hurled into space.

02:38.881 --> 02:41.881
(loud gusting wind)

02:43.561 --> 02:45.121
- This may in the long run be

02:45.121 --> 02:48.121
the only evidence that we ever existed.

02:48.121 --> 02:49.681
When you know that about something

02:49.681 --> 02:51.281
you're working on,

02:51.281 --> 02:53.921
you treat it with great respect.

02:54.801 --> 02:56.921
- It's taking what you thought you knew

02:56.921 --> 02:59.721
and having it just spun around

02:59.721 --> 03:03.721
and you're in one universe in one moment,

03:03.721 --> 03:06.441
you're in a completely
different universe the next.

03:06.441 --> 03:07.761
(beeping)

03:07.761 --> 03:11.081
♫ I'm wishing on a star

03:12.801 --> 03:16.281
♫ To follow where you are

03:18.081 --> 03:21.481
♫ I'm wishing on a dream

03:23.361 --> 03:26.881
♫ To follow what it means

03:28.721 --> 03:31.761
♫ And I wish on all the rainbows

03:31.761 --> 03:33.801
♫ That I see

03:33.801 --> 03:35.641
- [Narrator] When it was
just recently announced

03:35.641 --> 03:38.201
that Voyager One was interstellar space

03:38.201 --> 03:40.121
it was like humanity had just

03:40.121 --> 03:43.001
become an interstellar species.

03:43.001 --> 03:46.321
It was like knocking on eternity's door.

03:47.281 --> 03:49.001
- [Narrator] Voyager's on the
other side of the solar system

03:49.001 --> 03:50.521
and it's billions and billions

03:50.521 --> 03:53.801
of miles from the nearest
other human made object.

03:53.801 --> 03:57.041
♫ But Darwin knew would be

03:57.041 --> 03:58.161
- [Narrator] Just think about the distance

03:58.161 --> 03:59.641
that Voyager's gone

03:59.641 --> 04:01.841
and the years that it's
travelled to get there

04:01.841 --> 04:03.481
and it's still going.

04:03.481 --> 04:05.841
♫ So far away from me

04:05.841 --> 04:07.121
- [Narrator] Voyager made it.

04:07.121 --> 04:11.001
Accomplished something no
one dreamed it could do.

04:11.001 --> 04:13.681
- [Narrator] Every second
it goes to another place

04:13.681 --> 04:16.521
where we have never been before.

04:16.521 --> 04:18.001
- [Narrator] It's all
an escape trajectory.

04:18.001 --> 04:19.401
It's not coming back.

04:19.401 --> 04:22.121
It's just gonna keep
going forever and ever,

04:22.121 --> 04:24.401
out into empty empty space.

04:25.481 --> 04:26.721
- [Narrator] Voyager takes the cake.

04:26.721 --> 04:28.121
It's the most audacious mission.

04:28.121 --> 04:30.201
Who'd have thought that
we'd actually be able

04:30.201 --> 04:31.761
to do that in 1977?

04:33.161 --> 04:36.481
♫ I'm wishing on a star

04:37.641 --> 04:41.841
(slow paced music)
(faint clanking)

04:48.001 --> 04:49.521
- [Narrator] We knew a little,

04:49.521 --> 04:51.121
because you can't observe from the earth

04:51.121 --> 04:52.441
with telescopes.

04:54.841 --> 04:56.041
- It was big.

04:56.041 --> 04:56.881
No.

04:57.921 --> 04:59.681
Let's see, what did we know?

04:59.681 --> 05:00.801
(clanking)

05:00.801 --> 05:03.281
We knew they were all gas giants.

05:03.281 --> 05:05.521
Mostly made up of hydrogen and helium

05:05.521 --> 05:07.961
and some methane on the outer planets.

05:07.961 --> 05:09.721
- We knew that there
were winds on Jupiter,

05:09.721 --> 05:11.481
we knew about the great
red spot on Jupiter,

05:11.481 --> 05:13.681
we knew that there was trapped radiation,

05:13.681 --> 05:16.321
so we knew there was a magnetic field.

05:16.321 --> 05:17.601
- We knew for example that Jupiter

05:17.601 --> 05:19.601
that there were four moons.

05:19.601 --> 05:21.801
Io, Europa, Ganymede, and
Callisto going around.

05:21.801 --> 05:25.961
That's what convinced Galileo
that Copernicus was right

05:27.201 --> 05:31.561
and that the Sun is the
centre of the solar system.

05:31.561 --> 05:33.401
- Satellites of the outer planets,

05:33.401 --> 05:35.001
we knew that they were there because

05:35.001 --> 05:36.481
we could see them orbiting.

05:36.481 --> 05:38.921
But I think everyone figured they would be

05:38.921 --> 05:40.801
just battered ice balls.

05:40.801 --> 05:42.281
Kind of like the highlands of the moon.

05:42.281 --> 05:44.561
Nothing but impact craters.

05:44.561 --> 05:47.521
That view was so pervasive that they

05:47.521 --> 05:50.881
didn't even think to add any geologists

05:50.881 --> 05:52.681
to the Voyager mission.

05:52.681 --> 05:54.761
- For Saturn we knew about the rings

05:54.761 --> 05:57.361
and we knew about the major satellites.

05:57.361 --> 05:59.801
But hardly anything more than that.

05:59.801 --> 06:01.961
And it was all very fuzzy.

06:03.481 --> 06:06.521
Nobody had ever been to the
outer planets to speak of.

06:06.521 --> 06:09.401
Pioneer had gone past Jupiter and Saturn

06:09.401 --> 06:11.961
but they had elementary camera.

06:13.481 --> 06:16.281
It didn't really show very many images.

06:16.281 --> 06:19.801
And instrumentation was not very advanced.

06:20.921 --> 06:23.201
- The Pioneer spacecraft were mostly"

06:23.201 --> 06:25.441
"Let's see, can we send something through

06:25.441 --> 06:26.961
"the asteroid belt, would it survive?"

06:26.961 --> 06:29.041
There were so many things
that we take for granted now

06:29.041 --> 06:30.761
we knew nothing about.

06:30.761 --> 06:32.881
And the same was true
for Uranus and Neptune.

06:32.881 --> 06:35.081
They're very far away.

06:35.081 --> 06:37.321
- [Narrator] I had been
staring at these planets

06:37.321 --> 06:39.801
through some of the best
telescopes on earth.

06:39.801 --> 06:43.241
And yet, all I could see was fuzzy blobs.

06:44.241 --> 06:48.521
- Uranus was a small bluish
green dot in the telescope

06:48.521 --> 06:51.921
and Neptune was an even
smaller bluish dot.

06:51.921 --> 06:53.641
And that's all.

06:53.641 --> 06:55.361
- Astronomers had worked
pretty hard to know

06:55.361 --> 06:57.201
what physical makeup was.

06:57.201 --> 06:59.481
There was some basic characteristics.

06:59.481 --> 07:01.241
But their real nature

07:01.241 --> 07:04.801
in terms of weather, in
terms of distribution

07:04.801 --> 07:08.521
of mass inside, what
they were really made of,

07:08.521 --> 07:10.961
what the moons were like.

07:10.961 --> 07:12.001
We had none of that.

07:12.001 --> 07:14.601
Just little glimpses.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.201
- [Narrator] There's a
limit to what you can learn

07:16.201 --> 07:18.921
just looking through a
telescope from earth.

07:18.921 --> 07:21.801
There's theory but then there's unknowns.

07:21.801 --> 07:24.721
And we're researching the unknowns.

07:27.801 --> 07:30.561
- [Narrator] Human beings
are a curious bunch.

07:30.561 --> 07:32.921
We wanna know what's around the corner.

07:32.921 --> 07:35.641
We have to go past that
next bend in the road.

07:35.641 --> 07:38.281
So it's some sort of innate drive

07:38.281 --> 07:41.121
I think that we have as a species.

07:42.601 --> 07:45.081
- I think this innate desire to explore

07:45.081 --> 07:49.121
conveys an evolutionary advantage to us.

07:49.121 --> 07:51.641
We look to improve our circumstances.

07:51.641 --> 07:53.401
And I think that there is a feeling

07:53.401 --> 07:56.361
that our survival as a species

07:56.361 --> 07:59.401
is going to depend on our learning

07:59.401 --> 08:02.241
how to live on other worlds.

08:02.241 --> 08:05.121
- It's a very human
thing to ask questions.

08:05.121 --> 08:06.681
It's a very childlike thing

08:06.681 --> 08:08.481
to ask a million questions.

08:08.481 --> 08:09.721
(laughter)

08:09.721 --> 08:12.001
And some of us never grow up.

08:12.001 --> 08:14.881
(perky music)

08:14.881 --> 08:17.121
- One of the key things that
made this mission possible

08:17.121 --> 08:18.321
was gravity assist.

08:18.321 --> 08:20.961
That is when you fly by
Jupiter, you turn the corner,

08:20.961 --> 08:22.841
and you take a little bit of Jupiter's

08:22.841 --> 08:24.561
orbital speed with you.

08:24.561 --> 08:25.961
Like a slingshot.

08:25.961 --> 08:29.361
So you better make sure
Saturn's in the right place.

08:29.361 --> 08:31.561
- We were very fortunate

08:31.561 --> 08:34.321
that we had an alignment.

08:34.321 --> 08:36.521
- Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune

08:36.521 --> 08:37.401
would all line up.

08:37.401 --> 08:40.041
- It would go Jupiter boom, Saturn boom,

08:40.041 --> 08:42.561
Uranus boom, Neptune boom.

08:42.561 --> 08:44.441
- [Narrator] The planets
had to be lined up in

08:44.441 --> 08:47.721
just the right way to allow
one spacecraft to do that.

08:47.721 --> 08:50.801
- And that aligning up only occurs rarely.

08:50.801 --> 08:54.001
- It only happens like once
every more than 100 years.

08:54.001 --> 08:56.121
- 175 years, something like that.

08:56.121 --> 08:58.041
- Once every 176 years.

08:59.321 --> 09:00.801
- [Narrator] The previous time it happened

09:00.801 --> 09:04.161
exploration was wooden sailing ships.

09:04.161 --> 09:07.321
- It was named The Outer
Planets Grand Tour,

09:07.321 --> 09:10.201
and the cost of the
mission was estimated to be

09:10.201 --> 09:13.161
in excess of a billion dollars.

09:13.161 --> 09:16.961
The NASA administrator
went to the President,

09:16.961 --> 09:18.761
and he said "The last time the planets

09:18.761 --> 09:20.961
"were lined up like that,

09:20.961 --> 09:23.801
"President Jefferson was
sitting at your desk,

09:23.801 --> 09:25.241
"and he blew it."

09:26.401 --> 09:30.561
So, Mr. Nixon laughed and
said "All right, just do two."

09:32.361 --> 09:34.121
So, only two planets.

09:34.121 --> 09:36.921
And of course the price tag consequently

09:36.921 --> 09:38.841
was substantially less.

09:39.961 --> 09:43.961
But we all knew that
the launch was in 1977

09:43.961 --> 09:47.881
which would be after
Mr. Nixon's second term.

09:47.881 --> 09:49.601
And of course it turned out

09:49.601 --> 09:54.161
that his term ended a lot
sooner than even he thought.

09:54.161 --> 09:57.081
(slow paced music)

10:02.961 --> 10:04.641
- [Narrator] Voyager started as a project

10:04.641 --> 10:05.961
in July of 1972.

10:06.881 --> 10:08.681
And we had 11 scientific instruments,

10:08.681 --> 10:10.001
11 different teams.

10:10.001 --> 10:14.201
And the mission success was
one spacecraft past Saturn.

10:15.121 --> 10:17.281
- [Narrator] But we knew
right from the get go

10:17.281 --> 10:20.601
that we were going to
try as hard as we could

10:20.601 --> 10:24.081
to extend the mission to
go to Uranus and Neptune.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.401
- [Narrator] We selected
trajectories to pick

10:26.401 --> 10:28.961
a target at Saturn that would give us

10:28.961 --> 10:30.441
an assist to Uranus.

10:30.441 --> 10:33.281
And so we designed that
in from the beginning.

10:33.281 --> 10:36.121
We knew that we were endowing Voyager

10:36.121 --> 10:39.761
with the option if the
chance was there to use it.

10:39.761 --> 10:42.321
(upbeat music)

11:00.681 --> 11:03.121
- We didn't want to build
anything into the design

11:03.121 --> 11:05.601
that would have prevented
us from going further.

11:05.601 --> 11:08.761
So it was a mission within a mission.

11:08.761 --> 11:10.841
(heartbeat)

11:10.841 --> 11:13.601
(loud splashing)

11:15.761 --> 11:18.401
(ominous music)

11:20.241 --> 11:21.721
- The Golden Record really is the kind of

11:21.721 --> 11:24.641
heartbeat of the ship itself.

11:24.641 --> 11:26.921
The reason why it's going
there, it's certainly exploring,

11:26.921 --> 11:30.081
but it's the lifeblood is that record.

11:32.681 --> 11:36.521
- I remember all the publicity
Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft

11:36.521 --> 11:40.641
where they had some line drawings
of a male and female form.

11:40.641 --> 11:42.281
And some people went absolutely bonkers.

11:42.281 --> 11:43.401
I don't know if you've seen it

11:43.401 --> 11:46.001
but it's the most innocent
thing you can imagine.

11:46.001 --> 11:47.961
It caused a lot of commotion.

11:47.961 --> 11:49.601
Well I thought that was great.

11:49.601 --> 11:52.321
- Would you expect someone to
find this record out there?

11:52.321 --> 11:54.001
Is there something out there?

11:54.001 --> 11:54.841
- Well nobody knows.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.921
One of the great unsolved
questions is whether

11:56.921 --> 11:58.321
we're alone or we're.

11:58.321 --> 12:00.401
- Carl Sagan has become probably the best

12:00.401 --> 12:03.681
known scientist of the late 20th century.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.481
He was a working scientist.

12:05.481 --> 12:07.521
He played a key role in many

12:07.521 --> 12:10.241
of the NASA missions to the planets.

12:10.241 --> 12:11.881
Including the Voyager One.

12:11.881 --> 12:14.521
He's one of the scientists
on the Voyager imaging team.

12:14.521 --> 12:16.681
But he also was the astronomer who was

12:16.681 --> 12:18.281
as much as any one person,

12:18.281 --> 12:21.921
made the study of
extraterrestrial life credible.

12:21.921 --> 12:25.561
- The comment by a Thomas Carlisle,

12:25.561 --> 12:27.881
a somewhat crusty old fellow

12:29.121 --> 12:33.281
who upon thinking about
the stars, a sad spectacle.

12:35.441 --> 12:40.241
"If they be inhabited, what
a scope for misery and folly.

12:40.241 --> 12:43.801
"If they be not inhabited,
what a waste of space."

12:43.801 --> 12:44.921
(laughter)

12:44.921 --> 12:46.161
- Carl Sagan was a good friend of mine

12:46.161 --> 12:48.521
and I called him up and
said, "Hey, would you

12:48.521 --> 12:50.841
"be willing to undertake,
to come up with something

12:50.841 --> 12:52.481
"for us to put on the Voyager spacecraft?"

12:52.481 --> 12:54.561
He says "Yes, sure."

12:54.561 --> 12:57.481
And he told me he could
it for 25,000 bucks.

12:57.481 --> 12:59.281
So I authorised him to go ahead and do it

12:59.281 --> 13:02.441
and I sort of was hands off at that point.

13:02.441 --> 13:04.401
The whole creation was his and this group

13:04.401 --> 13:06.521
that he put together.

13:06.521 --> 13:08.241
- They figured don't let
this opportunity pass.

13:08.241 --> 13:11.281
You're gonna throw a message
in a bottle into the ocean,

13:11.281 --> 13:12.601
put a message in it.

13:12.601 --> 13:16.201
And so they decided to put
time capsules in those bottles.

13:16.201 --> 13:18.081
- And at first Carl thought they'd simply

13:18.081 --> 13:20.721
do another plaque, maybe
with some more information.

13:20.721 --> 13:23.081
But Frank Drake, a brilliant man.

13:23.081 --> 13:25.281
Kind of a cross between Albert Einstein

13:25.281 --> 13:26.721
and Thomas Edison.

13:26.721 --> 13:28.961
Brilliant theoretical
physicist, but also a very

13:28.961 --> 13:31.241
hands on kind of guy who can solve

13:31.241 --> 13:33.321
practical kinds of problems.

13:33.321 --> 13:34.961
He came up with the idea that for

13:34.961 --> 13:37.361
the same amount of weight and space,

13:37.361 --> 13:39.681
you could send a phonograph record.

13:39.681 --> 13:42.281
(slow paced music)

13:42.281 --> 13:44.001
- The people who actually did the science

13:44.001 --> 13:45.881
part of Voyager are always jealous and mad

13:45.881 --> 13:48.081
because the Golden Record
gets more attention

13:48.081 --> 13:49.921
than all the wonderful things they did

13:49.921 --> 13:52.361
exploring the outer planets
of the solar system.

13:52.361 --> 13:54.361
Except Pluto and all that.

13:54.361 --> 13:58.121
But the main attention
goes to the Golden Record.

13:58.121 --> 14:00.961
Because of the aura that
surrounds anything to do

14:00.961 --> 14:03.481
with extraterrestrial intelligent life,

14:03.481 --> 14:04.961
any kind of effort to contact

14:04.961 --> 14:07.761
extraterrestrial life is more fascinating

14:07.761 --> 14:09.081
than knowing the chemical makeup

14:09.081 --> 14:11.441
of a mineral on Mars or something.

14:11.441 --> 14:13.201
(laughs)

14:13.201 --> 14:15.761
- [Narrator] The record is
an old-style LP recording.

14:15.761 --> 14:17.841
The only difference is it's on metal,

14:17.841 --> 14:20.441
and that's so it will last a long time.

14:20.441 --> 14:22.081
- And it was recorded at half-speed

14:22.081 --> 14:24.881
so that gave us two hours of total time.

14:24.881 --> 14:26.761
An hour and a half of
it was devoted to music

14:26.761 --> 14:29.161
and the other half hour contains

14:29.161 --> 14:31.121
all of the other data on the record,

14:31.121 --> 14:34.361
the natural sounds of
Earth, the spoken greetings,

14:34.361 --> 14:37.401
and the encoded photographs of Earth.

14:37.401 --> 14:39.161
- [Narrator] One of the first
questions a lot of people ask

14:39.161 --> 14:41.441
is, well, they'll never
figure out how to play it.

14:41.441 --> 14:44.881
And in fact, we included
a cartridge and stylus

14:44.881 --> 14:46.441
in the package with the record,

14:46.441 --> 14:48.481
and the drawing on the cover

14:48.481 --> 14:50.041
of the record shows the method

14:50.041 --> 14:54.361
by which the stylus is to
be placed on the record.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.721
- Maybe what's written on it

14:55.721 --> 14:58.161
will seem like kindergarten
scribbles to them,

14:58.161 --> 15:00.401
but they should be able to figure it out

15:00.401 --> 15:01.841
if they've got some smart minds

15:01.841 --> 15:03.801
or whatever's in their heads,

15:03.801 --> 15:05.561
if they even have heads.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.681
- The Voyager launched
at the 100th anniversary

15:07.681 --> 15:10.601
of the development of the
phonograph record by Edison.

15:10.601 --> 15:12.721
And so it was a natural medium to put

15:12.721 --> 15:14.401
the information on.

15:14.401 --> 15:15.721
But what I find interesting is

15:15.721 --> 15:19.201
to protect it from the
dust and tiny particles

15:19.201 --> 15:22.241
of the journey, they put a cover over it.

15:22.241 --> 15:24.681
And on the cover was engraved

15:26.041 --> 15:30.041
the location of earth, our solar system

15:30.041 --> 15:34.161
in terms of it's direction
from different pulsars.

15:34.161 --> 15:35.441
- A lot of people would say,
"Well why would you do that?"

15:35.441 --> 15:36.281
I said, "What do you mean?"

15:36.281 --> 15:38.241
They said "Well why would
you announce where you are?"

15:38.241 --> 15:39.841
'Cause there are aliens out there that

15:39.841 --> 15:42.241
probably raid planets
and use them for food,

15:42.241 --> 15:44.281
or eat the people, or make them slaves.

15:44.281 --> 15:46.081
If they find it, their
technology is probably

15:46.081 --> 15:47.121
more advanced than ours.

15:47.121 --> 15:48.321
They'll come here and destroy it.

15:48.321 --> 15:49.921
So why would you do something like that?

15:49.921 --> 15:52.561
So if somebody did find it
they would be thinking that way

15:52.561 --> 15:54.841
and they said, "Why would
these people expose themselves

15:54.841 --> 15:58.441
"to our veracious appetites
or whatever it is.

15:58.441 --> 16:01.001
"They must be very altruistic."

16:04.401 --> 16:07.401
- The chance that advanced intelligence

16:07.401 --> 16:10.201
beyond us would detect "Oh, hey,

16:10.201 --> 16:14.561
"there is a radiating
body coming into our area,

16:14.561 --> 16:18.241
"let's go out and find out
what this bottle in the ocean,

16:18.241 --> 16:20.521
"what message it might have."

16:20.521 --> 16:22.881
Now is that a grand mystery?

16:24.441 --> 16:25.281
Whoa!

16:27.161 --> 16:29.081
- Well that brings up the whole question,

16:29.081 --> 16:31.961
is there anybody out there?

16:31.961 --> 16:32.801
Listen,

16:34.161 --> 16:36.721
there are give or take

16:36.721 --> 16:40.041
200 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.721
There are about 200 billion
galaxies in the universe.

16:42.721 --> 16:45.921
Or at least in the universe we know about.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.201
- It's a pretty small spacecraft

16:48.201 --> 16:51.081
and it's a pretty big universe.

16:51.081 --> 16:53.321
If you take a piece of sky

16:53.321 --> 16:56.081
the size of a soda straw up there

16:57.561 --> 16:59.201
in the Big Dipper,

16:59.201 --> 17:02.481
in that tiny piece of what
we thought was blank sky

17:02.481 --> 17:04.961
was thousands of galaxies.

17:04.961 --> 17:06.961
And each one of those galaxies

17:06.961 --> 17:09.721
is filled with billions of stars.

17:10.761 --> 17:11.921
That's just the soda straw,

17:11.921 --> 17:14.001
and now you imagine the whole sky

17:14.001 --> 17:16.121
filled with thousands upon thousands

17:16.121 --> 17:17.561
upon thousands of galaxies.

17:17.561 --> 17:19.641
Each of which is billions
of billions of stars.

17:19.641 --> 17:22.881
There's a lot of possibility out there.

17:26.481 --> 17:29.441
- If you took a grain of
sand and put it on the table,

17:29.441 --> 17:31.681
and if that were the size of the Sun,

17:31.681 --> 17:33.881
then the earth would
be about an inch away.

17:33.881 --> 17:35.281
And it would be microscopic.

17:35.281 --> 17:37.361
And the entire solar
system would fit on a table

17:37.361 --> 17:38.681
six feet across.

17:39.561 --> 17:40.841
Think about the next star.

17:40.841 --> 17:42.881
The next star would be
another grain of sand.

17:42.881 --> 17:44.921
How far away from that solar system

17:44.921 --> 17:46.321
would you have to put that?

17:46.321 --> 17:50.041
And it turns out to be about
seven and a half miles away.

17:50.041 --> 17:52.521
It's absolutely remarkable how much space

17:52.521 --> 17:56.561
there is between the stars
and between the planets.

17:56.561 --> 17:59.561
- The distances are almost unfathomable.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.121
These were the fastest spacecraft

18:01.121 --> 18:04.481
that had ever been built
and launched and flown,

18:04.481 --> 18:05.961
and they're travelling

18:05.961 --> 18:07.881
at 10 miles per second.

18:09.801 --> 18:11.361
You wouldn't even see it, right?

18:11.361 --> 18:12.841
And yet, even at those

18:12.841 --> 18:16.561
unfathomable by Earth standard speeds,

18:16.561 --> 18:18.561
it takes decades,

18:18.561 --> 18:22.721
decades to get out there
into the outer solar system.

18:24.401 --> 18:25.521
- We don't have any problem putting

18:25.521 --> 18:26.881
the spacecraft through the Asteroid Belt

18:26.881 --> 18:28.321
and yet at one time people think god

18:28.321 --> 18:30.441
that you were gonna
crash into an asteroid.

18:30.441 --> 18:34.161
There's not very much chance
of crashing into an asteroid.

18:34.161 --> 18:36.361
It's just a lot of room out there.

18:36.361 --> 18:37.521
A lot of room.

18:39.081 --> 18:40.521
- If you wanna realise
how empty our galaxy is,

18:40.521 --> 18:42.841
the nearest galaxy to
our own is Andromeda,

18:42.841 --> 18:44.081
it's about two million light years away.

18:44.081 --> 18:46.841
It's on a collision
course with us right now.

18:46.841 --> 18:47.881
And in five billion years

18:47.881 --> 18:49.961
that galaxy's going to
collide with our own.

18:49.961 --> 18:51.401
And you might say, oh, no, oh, no,

18:51.401 --> 18:52.801
but it turns out,

18:53.681 --> 18:56.481
space is, even in our galaxy,
it's mostly empty space.

18:56.481 --> 18:58.601
When our two galaxies collide,

18:58.601 --> 19:01.201
almost no stars will hit any other star.

19:01.201 --> 19:03.281
It's mostly empty space.

19:03.281 --> 19:05.321
So Voyager is likely
to continue throughout

19:05.321 --> 19:07.721
our galaxy for potentially millions

19:07.721 --> 19:11.841
or maybe even billions of
years without a collision.

19:11.841 --> 19:16.281
- I have a hard time with really
long geological timeframes.

19:16.281 --> 19:20.041
You just can't get your hands around how

19:20.041 --> 19:22.481
10s of millions of years,
what that really means.

19:22.481 --> 19:25.481
And distances, astronomical distances.

19:25.481 --> 19:28.321
- Yeah, once you start getting
into the astronomical scales,

19:28.321 --> 19:30.201
our solar system is pretty tiny,

19:30.201 --> 19:32.761
and so this adventure of Voyager

19:32.761 --> 19:35.681
which seems so remote and distant

19:35.681 --> 19:38.161
for this little spacecraft to go out

19:38.161 --> 19:41.841
to the giant planets is
really just exploring

19:41.841 --> 19:44.841
the tiniest closest neighbourhood

19:44.841 --> 19:47.681
when you start thinking
about cosmic scales.

19:47.681 --> 19:49.761
(static)

19:58.081 --> 19:59.121
- The spacecraft were built

19:59.121 --> 20:00.801
at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

20:00.801 --> 20:02.441
It's a federal research centre

20:02.441 --> 20:06.601
that's part of Cal-Tech
and they build spacecraft.

20:07.841 --> 20:09.641
One of the things I just admire most

20:09.641 --> 20:11.681
about the engineers who built Voyager

20:11.681 --> 20:13.321
is that they're always thinking about

20:13.321 --> 20:16.321
the most improbable things happening.

20:16.321 --> 20:17.361
You know, you want to take those people

20:17.361 --> 20:18.521
on a camping trip with you

20:18.521 --> 20:19.561
because they will think of.

20:19.561 --> 20:20.881
Well, you've got to bring,

20:20.881 --> 20:22.001
what if these bugs come out,

20:22.001 --> 20:23.241
what if the tent gets flooded,

20:23.241 --> 20:24.881
what if you run out of gas,

20:24.881 --> 20:26.881
what if you can't start
the fire, you know.

20:26.881 --> 20:28.441
They're the what if people.

20:28.441 --> 20:31.521
And when you're sending
something out into space

20:31.521 --> 20:33.241
you can't go do a service call,

20:33.241 --> 20:34.841
you can't bring it back,

20:34.841 --> 20:36.201
so your what if list

20:36.201 --> 20:38.561
had better be like that long

20:38.561 --> 20:41.761
or you're not going to be able to survive.

20:41.761 --> 20:43.841
(static)

20:47.361 --> 20:49.241
- These projects begin

20:49.241 --> 20:52.441
with a conceptualization period.

20:52.441 --> 20:56.881
How feasible is it for
us to do thus and so?

20:56.881 --> 21:00.321
We didn't know what the
spacecraft was gonna look like.

21:00.321 --> 21:01.961
How do we arrange a spacecraft?

21:01.961 --> 21:05.521
How do we take the communications system,

21:05.521 --> 21:09.361
this large 12-foot diameter fixed antenna,

21:09.361 --> 21:13.721
and arrange it relative
to the propulsion system?

21:13.721 --> 21:17.121
The spacecraft took on the
dimension of being a child,

21:17.121 --> 21:20.601
and our design teams, you know,
were like kind of parents.

21:20.601 --> 21:24.361
This was actually a nurturing process.

21:24.361 --> 21:25.961
Bringing that child,

21:25.961 --> 21:28.121
if you will, into reality.

21:31.961 --> 21:34.361
- All spacecraft were made
basically of the same things.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.721
Silicon and aluminium, that's about it.

21:36.721 --> 21:38.481
You know, that's probably 95% of it.

21:38.481 --> 21:40.401
Silicon and aluminium is cheap

21:40.401 --> 21:44.281
until you start making
stuff out if it, you know.

21:44.281 --> 21:46.121
- The spacecraft of
course is quite primitive

21:46.121 --> 21:47.241
by modern day standards.

21:47.241 --> 21:49.681
We have three computers on board.

21:49.681 --> 21:51.881
Their total memory is about,

21:51.881 --> 21:55.721
240,000 times less than
in your smartphone.

21:55.721 --> 21:58.281
- 1972 was when you had
the technology freeze.

21:58.281 --> 22:00.121
Remember we launched in 77.

22:00.121 --> 22:02.441
So you freeze technology
several years earlier,

22:02.441 --> 22:05.201
and at the time the biggest
computers in the world

22:05.201 --> 22:07.041
were comparable to the kinds of things

22:07.041 --> 22:08.801
we have in our pockets today.

22:08.801 --> 22:11.001
And I'm not talking about a cell phone.

22:11.001 --> 22:13.801
I'm actually talking about a key fob.

22:13.801 --> 22:15.401
- What's wrong with 70s technology?

22:15.401 --> 22:20.121
I mean, you're looking at me,
I'm a 30s technology, right?

22:20.121 --> 22:21.681
I don't apologise for the limitations

22:21.681 --> 22:23.961
that we were working with at the time.

22:23.961 --> 22:28.881
We milked the technology for
what we could get from it.

22:28.881 --> 22:31.321
- Voyager is about 800 kilogrammes.

22:31.321 --> 22:34.281
It's main antenna is 12 feet in diameter,

22:34.281 --> 22:36.401
which was the largest we could launch.

22:36.401 --> 22:37.361
- There's this body,

22:37.361 --> 22:40.601
this 10 sided can called the bus,

22:40.601 --> 22:43.481
and that's got all the
electronics and the computers.

22:43.481 --> 22:45.041
And that's got these arms and

22:45.041 --> 22:46.761
these appendages that stick out.

22:46.761 --> 22:49.201
It has these feet that
connected it to the rocket

22:49.201 --> 22:50.881
and then a really long arm

22:50.881 --> 22:53.161
with a magnetic field
sensor on it over here

22:53.161 --> 22:56.201
and another arm over there with
this plutonium power supply

22:56.201 --> 22:57.361
to give it its electricity.

22:57.361 --> 22:58.721
You can't keep that too
close to the spacecraft

22:58.721 --> 23:00.721
because it will radiate the spacecraft.

23:00.721 --> 23:02.481
And another arm with this device

23:02.481 --> 23:04.521
that had the cameras and
other instruments on it

23:04.521 --> 23:06.761
that could point around,
kind of like the eyes,

23:06.761 --> 23:10.241
and the big antenna was the ears.

23:10.241 --> 23:12.041
When everything is fully extended

23:12.041 --> 23:13.841
to its greatest dimensions,

23:13.841 --> 23:18.201
it's comparable in size to
sort of a small school bus.

23:18.201 --> 23:20.521
It really is graceful,

23:20.521 --> 23:23.521
despite the kind of gangly appearance.

23:23.521 --> 23:26.481
A strange-looking being for our planet,

23:26.481 --> 23:28.601
but perfectly happy in space.

23:28.601 --> 23:31.681
(instrumental music)

23:50.601 --> 23:53.201
(tribal music)

23:56.481 --> 23:59.641
- I became the producer of
only one record in my career,

23:59.641 --> 24:01.721
and only two copies of it were made,

24:01.721 --> 24:03.641
and they were both hurled off the earth,

24:03.641 --> 24:05.721
so I don't know if that's
a credential or not.

24:05.721 --> 24:07.081
(record scratching)

24:07.081 --> 24:09.041
The launch window for Voyager was set.

24:09.041 --> 24:11.961
It had to do with an alignment
of the outer planets.

24:11.961 --> 24:13.641
You have to launch in that window.

24:13.641 --> 24:18.241
And they sure as hell weren't
going to wait for the record.

24:18.241 --> 24:20.201
- We had six weeks to do it.

24:20.201 --> 24:21.561
And when I talk about the record

24:21.561 --> 24:24.241
I think that's what always
draws the biggest gasp.

24:24.241 --> 24:25.521
That you had to figure out a way

24:25.521 --> 24:27.081
to explain the world to aliens,

24:27.081 --> 24:29.321
and by the way it has to
be finished in six weeks.

24:29.321 --> 24:32.161
(slow jazz music)

24:34.201 --> 24:36.841
- We had two goals in
making the Voyager record,

24:36.841 --> 24:37.961
in terms of the music.

24:37.961 --> 24:41.281
The first was we wanted
the music to represent

24:41.281 --> 24:43.441
many different cultures around the world

24:43.441 --> 24:45.641
and not just the culture of the society

24:45.641 --> 24:48.721
that had built and
launched the spacecraft.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.081
(deep bass)

24:52.561 --> 24:54.401
The other criterion was we

24:54.401 --> 24:57.041
wanted it to be a good record.

24:57.041 --> 24:59.681
- [Narrator] It's a very
idiosyncratic message.

24:59.681 --> 25:01.961
It doesn't seem like
something made by a committee.

25:01.961 --> 25:03.681
It's too quirky.

25:03.681 --> 25:04.601
(opera music)

25:04.601 --> 25:06.161
- Nowadays you work a lot on the internet

25:06.161 --> 25:08.201
than those days, it was more,

25:08.201 --> 25:10.041
sitting in the dark
listening to pieces of music,

25:10.041 --> 25:11.601
making notes.

25:11.601 --> 25:13.121
(opera music)

25:13.121 --> 25:14.441
It takes a long time to go through

25:14.441 --> 25:17.441
a stack of records that's that high.

25:20.641 --> 25:22.241
If you listen to the Voyager record,

25:22.241 --> 25:23.521
it would be remarkable if you

25:23.521 --> 25:24.761
didn't hear some pieces of music

25:24.761 --> 25:26.201
that were quite unlike anything

25:26.201 --> 25:27.521
you had heard before.

25:27.521 --> 25:29.041
The Japanese shakuhachi piece

25:29.041 --> 25:32.241
or the 16 year-old pygmy girl singing

25:32.241 --> 25:33.681
what's called an initiation song,

25:33.681 --> 25:35.281
a kind of puberty song,

25:35.281 --> 25:37.681
in the Ituri forest of Africa

25:37.681 --> 25:40.281
is just unbelievably beautiful.

25:41.521 --> 25:45.241
The Javanese gamelan
piece is just beautiful.

25:46.121 --> 25:48.401
The Chinese ch'in piece
was the sort of thing

25:48.401 --> 25:50.601
that will never leave you.

25:53.081 --> 25:56.681
It was a terrific mind
expanding adventure.

25:58.361 --> 26:00.281
There was a certain amount of hunting up

26:00.281 --> 26:03.161
rare records here and there.

26:03.161 --> 26:05.361
I remember the back of an Indian

26:05.361 --> 26:07.481
appliance store in New York

26:07.481 --> 26:09.481
where they had some Indian records,

26:09.481 --> 26:11.561
and there was one copy of a raga

26:11.561 --> 26:14.121
that we ended up putting on the record.

26:14.121 --> 26:17.321
(raga music)

26:17.321 --> 26:19.041
- Always the criterion was that we were

26:19.041 --> 26:21.681
trying to describe our culture.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.961
So it would include folk
music, and primitive music

26:23.961 --> 26:28.241
and Bach and Beethoven,
and jazz, and all of that.

26:28.241 --> 26:29.801
And something we wanted very much

26:29.801 --> 26:31.921
was the music of the Beatles.

26:31.921 --> 26:34.281
And they said "No way."

26:34.281 --> 26:36.721
And we said "Well this is
all going in outer space,

26:36.721 --> 26:39.121
"it will never be heard on earth.

26:39.121 --> 26:40.801
"No we don't do it."

26:42.841 --> 26:44.641
They don't licence for outer space.

26:44.641 --> 26:46.881
(laughter)

26:47.801 --> 26:49.601
- I would have loved to
have had a Bob Dylan piece

26:49.601 --> 26:51.521
but really there's only room

26:51.521 --> 26:55.401
for at most one contemporary rock piece.

26:55.401 --> 26:56.681
(electric guitar)

26:56.681 --> 26:57.681
But you know you're up against

26:57.681 --> 26:59.081
Chuck Berry's Johnny B. Goode,

26:59.081 --> 27:00.041
which Bob Dylan himself would

27:00.041 --> 27:02.201
admit is an awfully good single.

27:02.201 --> 27:04.441
- It may be just four simple words

27:04.441 --> 27:06.521
but it is the first positive proof

27:06.521 --> 27:09.321
that other intelligent
beings inhabit the universe.

27:09.321 --> 27:11.561
- What are the four words Cocuwa?

27:11.561 --> 27:13.801
- Send more Chuck Berry.

27:13.801 --> 27:15.641
(laughter)

27:15.641 --> 27:18.121
- The world is full of fantastic music,

27:18.121 --> 27:19.081
and it goes without saying

27:19.081 --> 27:20.281
there's a lot more great music

27:20.281 --> 27:21.841
that's not on the Voyager record

27:21.841 --> 27:24.001
than there is on it.

27:24.001 --> 27:25.281
Which is a good thing, too,

27:25.281 --> 27:27.201
I mean, if you imagine living on a planet

27:27.201 --> 27:29.921
that was so pathetic that
it only had 90 minutes

27:29.921 --> 27:31.881
of decent music.

27:31.881 --> 27:33.921
- [Narrator] Flight
control to launch enable.

27:33.921 --> 27:34.841
- [Narrator] Roger.

27:34.841 --> 27:36.841
- [Narrator] A countdown
will begin in 10 minutes

27:36.841 --> 27:38.281
before midnight tonight.

27:38.281 --> 27:39.521
- [Narrator] A journey about to begin

27:39.521 --> 27:41.321
which will take the technology of earth

27:41.321 --> 27:43.121
out of our solar system.

27:43.121 --> 27:45.281
- When it was launched, it
was of course all folded up,

27:45.281 --> 27:46.921
it was like origami.

27:48.521 --> 27:50.841
- Here was this almost

27:50.841 --> 27:52.921
unexpected encapsulation.

27:54.721 --> 27:56.121
I mean, we knew that we were

27:56.121 --> 27:57.121
going to be encapsulated,

27:57.121 --> 27:58.801
but the emotional effect on that

27:58.801 --> 28:00.521
was kind of surprising.

28:00.521 --> 28:04.441
I noticed that in just looking around me.

28:04.441 --> 28:08.161
I realised that this was
the last time any of us

28:08.161 --> 28:11.721
were going to see the
spacecraft with eyes.

28:18.001 --> 28:20.841
That's a fairly moving experience.

28:23.801 --> 28:24.961
- [Narrator] Environmental control, ready?

28:24.961 --> 28:26.041
- [Narrator] Roger.

28:26.041 --> 28:29.401
- We actually launched Voyager Two first.

28:29.401 --> 28:31.401
And this gave the media,

28:32.961 --> 28:34.361
drove them nuts.

28:34.361 --> 28:36.481
We launched Voyager One later,

28:36.481 --> 28:39.081
but it was launched on
a faster trajectory.

28:39.081 --> 28:43.161
So it overtook Voyager
Two in December of 1977.

28:43.161 --> 28:44.801
From that point on, Voyager One

28:44.801 --> 28:47.361
always got to the planet
before Voyager Two,

28:47.361 --> 28:49.921
and the press was happy,
they understood it.

28:49.921 --> 28:51.921
- Most of the press release drawings

28:51.921 --> 28:53.961
show the other side of the spacecraft

28:53.961 --> 28:56.001
so you can't see the Voyager record.

28:56.001 --> 28:57.721
But when the reporters came to the launch,

28:57.721 --> 29:00.601
they all wanted to know
more about the record.

29:00.601 --> 29:03.401
There was always a lot of
ambiguity in NASA about this.

29:03.401 --> 29:05.881
There's no question that the
Voyager record is useless

29:05.881 --> 29:07.921
from a scientific standpoint,

29:07.921 --> 29:11.121
and the officials reluctantly
arranged a press conference.

29:11.121 --> 29:14.201
(upbeat polka music)

29:15.601 --> 29:17.521
The press conference was a joke really.

29:17.521 --> 29:19.881
It was held in a hotel room

29:19.881 --> 29:21.281
separated by one of those

29:21.281 --> 29:23.561
accordion folding barriers that you pull

29:23.561 --> 29:26.601
across to make one room
into two smaller rooms.

29:26.601 --> 29:28.921
From what was literally,
as memory serves me,

29:28.921 --> 29:31.681
a Polish wedding reception.

29:31.681 --> 29:32.961
We did the whole press conference

29:32.961 --> 29:35.081
with the oompah sound of

29:35.081 --> 29:37.241
a wedding reception next door.

29:37.241 --> 29:38.801
But I think the public seemed to get it.

29:38.801 --> 29:41.321
(polka music)

29:43.161 --> 29:44.321
- [Narrator] We have just had a report

29:44.321 --> 29:47.801
from John Casani, the
Voyager Project Manager

29:47.801 --> 29:51.241
that we'll be able to countdown at 10:25.

29:52.641 --> 29:55.641
- [Narrator] They were launched
on a Titan launch vehicle.

29:55.641 --> 29:57.761
Which were intercontinental
ballistic missiles

29:57.761 --> 29:58.921
for a long time.

29:58.921 --> 30:01.401
And some of them as
they were decommissioned

30:01.401 --> 30:03.761
were turned into rockets
to launch spacecraft

30:03.761 --> 30:05.561
out to the planets.

30:05.561 --> 30:07.001
- [Narrator] Five, four,

30:07.001 --> 30:08.321
three, two, one.

30:10.881 --> 30:14.081
We have ignition, and we have liftoff.

30:14.081 --> 30:16.361
- You see those solids ignite

30:16.361 --> 30:17.681
and you're really not prepared

30:17.681 --> 30:19.641
for what's about to occur.

30:19.641 --> 30:21.801
(gentle guitar music)

30:21.801 --> 30:24.521
(low rumbling)

30:24.521 --> 30:26.961
The sound waves then catch up

30:28.441 --> 30:29.521
and then this

30:31.041 --> 30:35.401
forceful shaking, the
body is actually moved

30:35.401 --> 30:37.921
in resonance with this energy.

30:38.801 --> 30:40.801
Shaking it, right.

30:40.801 --> 30:42.881
(low rumbling)

30:42.881 --> 30:45.521
- We jumped up and down.

30:45.521 --> 30:46.761
Big hugs you know.

30:46.761 --> 30:49.801
We're so happy to have
gotten away with it.

30:49.801 --> 30:50.761
And the rocket worked.

30:50.761 --> 30:53.081
You never know about that either.

30:53.081 --> 30:54.241
- We were sitting in bleachers

30:54.241 --> 30:57.121
and they keep you pretty
far from the launch vehicle

30:57.121 --> 30:58.521
because they can explode, and

30:58.521 --> 31:00.321
it's basically, it's a big bomb.

31:00.321 --> 31:02.281
- So there was a little bit
of holding your breath and

31:02.281 --> 31:03.921
wanting to make sure you see it,

31:03.921 --> 31:06.521
get that first little motion

31:06.521 --> 31:09.401
off the pad starting into space.

31:09.401 --> 31:11.361
- We saw that going off into space,

31:11.361 --> 31:12.681
we were all thinking this thought.

31:12.681 --> 31:14.001
There it goes

31:14.001 --> 31:16.041
and it's gonna be out
there to represent us

31:16.041 --> 31:18.721
for the next five billion years.

31:18.721 --> 31:20.961
- I was a seven year
old child watching it go

31:20.961 --> 31:23.361
and thinking like "Oh
I had some small thing

31:23.361 --> 31:24.521
"to do on that."

31:24.521 --> 31:26.241
Like there's some part of me on that.

31:26.241 --> 31:28.161
But no real significance.

31:28.161 --> 31:30.841
But it was like, yeah okay, bye.

31:31.761 --> 31:35.921
(faint cheering)
(slow paced music)

31:37.681 --> 31:40.201
- There were outbursts of joy.

31:41.081 --> 31:42.681
We were on our way.

31:44.601 --> 31:45.601
- And then we launched it

31:45.601 --> 31:48.361
and then other things went crazy.

31:50.361 --> 31:51.961
The spacecraft began to do things

31:51.961 --> 31:55.441
that we had no expectation
that it would have done.

31:55.441 --> 31:57.241
- Us poor people on Earth,

31:57.241 --> 31:59.921
we're like "What is it doing?"

31:59.921 --> 32:01.841
- And as the launch vehicle
leaves the launchpad,

32:01.841 --> 32:04.241
it has to roll through a certain angle

32:04.241 --> 32:07.081
to get to the right
direction for departure.

32:07.081 --> 32:09.761
And the rate that it rolls
at is a much higher rate

32:09.761 --> 32:12.961
than the spacecraft would ever
normally experience flying.

32:12.961 --> 32:14.761
And so the gyro hits the stops.

32:14.761 --> 32:16.161
It saturates.

32:16.161 --> 32:17.721
- Voyager was not in control of itself.

32:17.721 --> 32:19.481
It's just riding this big rocket,

32:19.481 --> 32:21.241
and that was shaking it in such a way

32:21.241 --> 32:23.361
that it thought it was failing,

32:23.361 --> 32:25.561
and so it started switching
off various boxes,

32:25.561 --> 32:26.761
changing to the back-up this,

32:26.761 --> 32:27.761
to the back-up that.

32:27.761 --> 32:30.321
Trying to figure out why all
this stuff was happening.

32:30.321 --> 32:32.401
- For a couple of days
it was a real nail-biter.

32:32.401 --> 32:33.761
People were asking us,

32:33.761 --> 32:35.001
"Have you lost the spacecraft"

32:35.001 --> 32:37.001
and we would say "We don't know for sure,"

32:37.001 --> 32:39.601
because we didn't know for sure.

32:39.601 --> 32:42.801
- And the headline read "Mutiny in Space".

32:42.801 --> 32:44.721
The Voyager spacecraft had decided

32:44.721 --> 32:47.041
it just didn't want to
follow the instructions

32:47.041 --> 32:49.001
that its human controllers were giving it

32:49.001 --> 32:51.561
and it was going to do
what it wanted to do.

32:51.561 --> 32:54.481
- Fortunately, the person
who had written that code

32:54.481 --> 32:56.761
was able to say "This is okay.

32:56.761 --> 32:58.441
"It's doing this, it tried that,

32:58.441 --> 32:59.801
"it's doing this, it tried that,"

32:59.801 --> 33:02.481
and calm everyone else down.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.961
(bird screeching)

33:04.961 --> 33:06.601
- [Narrator] All the time it
was doing that crazy stuff

33:06.601 --> 33:08.801
it was doing exactly what we had

33:08.801 --> 33:10.401
designed it to do along.

33:10.401 --> 33:11.401
(laughter)

33:11.401 --> 33:13.401
- The limits were set simply too tight.

33:13.401 --> 33:15.241
It needed to be able

33:15.241 --> 33:18.201
to wiggle more and vibrate more.

33:18.201 --> 33:21.281
And the telemetry length wasn't gonna

33:22.241 --> 33:24.801
be a solid as people expected.

33:24.801 --> 33:26.161
So all of those things

33:26.161 --> 33:28.921
that had caused issues with Voyager Two

33:28.921 --> 33:31.681
then were solved for Voyager One.

33:32.681 --> 33:33.801
- [Narrator] Titan Centaur 6

33:33.801 --> 33:35.161
has lifted off at 8:56 from here

33:35.161 --> 33:36.961
at the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.

33:36.961 --> 33:38.881
- [Narrator] When Voyager One lifted off,

33:38.881 --> 33:40.601
we're thinking everything's okay.

33:40.601 --> 33:42.281
And then we begin to hear this,

33:42.281 --> 33:44.321
we call it chatter over
the launch vehicle net

33:44.321 --> 33:46.441
that something wasn't right.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.801
- I looked over at him and he looked like

33:47.801 --> 33:48.841
he was a little worried.

33:48.841 --> 33:50.561
And I said "What's the matter, Charley?"

33:50.561 --> 33:51.841
And he says "I don't know,

33:51.841 --> 33:55.081
"I don't think we're going
to make it, you know."

33:55.081 --> 33:56.961
There was a leak in the propellant line,

33:56.961 --> 33:58.841
and we were losing propellant overboard.

33:58.841 --> 34:00.441
So while it was burning,

34:00.441 --> 34:02.441
propellant was escaping
from the launch vehicle.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.161
And that's why second stage never got

34:04.161 --> 34:05.921
to deliver its full thrust

34:05.921 --> 34:07.601
because it ran out of fuel.

34:07.601 --> 34:09.881
- And so the upper which was a Centaur,

34:09.881 --> 34:12.401
liquid, hydrogen, and oxygen stage

34:12.401 --> 34:14.001
had to make up for that.

34:14.001 --> 34:15.241
- And the Centaur is the stage

34:15.241 --> 34:16.561
that's doing the guidance.

34:16.561 --> 34:18.761
So the Centaur knows
that it's not reaching

34:18.761 --> 34:20.281
the required velocity.

34:20.281 --> 34:23.321
And when it separates
from the second stage

34:23.321 --> 34:25.121
it knows it has to burn longer

34:25.121 --> 34:27.161
to add more velocity.

34:27.161 --> 34:30.161
- The Centaur, to achieve parking orbit,

34:30.161 --> 34:33.921
had to use 1,200 pounds
of extra propellant.

34:33.921 --> 34:35.161
Now we're all thinking,

34:35.161 --> 34:37.241
is it going to have
enough left in the tanks

34:37.241 --> 34:39.201
to make a normal injection?

34:39.201 --> 34:41.321
Or is it going to run out of fuel?

34:41.321 --> 34:43.801
(suspenseful music)

34:43.801 --> 34:47.361
Fortunately, it had
three and a half seconds

34:47.361 --> 34:50.921
of thrusting left before it
had run to fuel depletion.

34:50.921 --> 34:52.921
Three and a half seconds,

34:52.921 --> 34:56.001
so Voyager One just barely made it.

34:56.001 --> 34:57.241
- It wouldn't have gotten enough velocity

34:57.241 --> 34:58.761
to get to Jupiter, you know.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.481
So instead of getting
to Jupiter, you know,

35:00.481 --> 35:02.041
we'd have gotten almost to Jupiter

35:02.041 --> 35:03.961
and then we'd come back toward the Sun,

35:03.961 --> 35:05.121
which would not have been good.

35:05.121 --> 35:07.281
(laughter)

35:07.281 --> 35:11.881
♫ I watch the distant
lights go down a long way

35:11.881 --> 35:16.521
♫ Disappear into the evening sky

35:16.521 --> 35:18.561
♫ Oh you know I'm with you

35:18.561 --> 35:21.561
♫ On your journey

35:21.561 --> 35:24.321
♫ Never could say goodbye

35:24.321 --> 35:26.001
- And then of course, you know,

35:26.001 --> 35:29.801
there's the thought that
it's out of our hands.

35:29.801 --> 35:32.721
Now the major reason for this

35:32.721 --> 35:35.361
mission was about to unfold,

35:35.361 --> 35:37.441
that is the science.

35:37.441 --> 35:38.441
But our role

35:40.401 --> 35:41.321
as keepers,

35:42.681 --> 35:44.001
as progenitors,

35:46.521 --> 35:48.761
our role had been finished.

35:49.841 --> 35:54.041
♫ It's just a phase you're going through

35:54.041 --> 35:55.681
♫ No I won't stop you

35:55.681 --> 35:57.481
That was moving.

35:57.481 --> 36:02.441
(loud explosion)
♫ Break away

36:02.441 --> 36:06.481
♫ Fly across your ocean

36:06.481 --> 36:08.921
♫ Break away

36:11.481 --> 36:15.361
♫ Time has come for you

36:15.361 --> 36:17.801
♫ Break away

36:20.361 --> 36:24.001
♫ Fly across your ocean

36:24.001 --> 36:26.441
♫ Break away

36:29.281 --> 36:31.961
♫ Time has come

36:33.081 --> 36:35.321
- It's what realising
that a human life ago,

36:35.321 --> 36:37.481
less than 100 years ago, 87 years ago,

36:37.481 --> 36:40.481
the universe consisted of one galaxy,

36:40.481 --> 36:42.001
our Milky Way Galaxy.

36:42.001 --> 36:45.801
In a static eternal universe
with eternal empty space.

36:45.801 --> 36:48.001
We didn't know about the
other hundred billion galaxies

36:48.001 --> 36:50.281
a single human lifetime ago.

36:50.281 --> 36:52.081
And we didn't know the
universe was expanding

36:52.081 --> 36:55.921
and it was born in a big
bang 13.7 billion years ago.

36:55.921 --> 36:57.481
But even stranger things like

36:57.481 --> 36:58.921
the things I work on.

36:58.921 --> 37:01.321
The fact that most of the mass
of our galaxies invisible.

37:01.321 --> 37:03.041
It's made of stuff other than you or me.

37:03.041 --> 37:05.041
We think it's made of some
new elementary particle

37:05.041 --> 37:06.881
that is actually going right through you

37:06.881 --> 37:08.681
and me right now and
right through the earth

37:08.681 --> 37:10.201
without even noticing it was there.

37:10.201 --> 37:11.881
Even stranger than that is the fact

37:11.881 --> 37:14.561
that empty space weighs something.

37:14.561 --> 37:16.681
You get rid of all the
particles and the radiation,

37:16.681 --> 37:19.201
you have nothing there
and it weighs something.

37:19.201 --> 37:21.201
And moreover, it's the
dominant energy in the universe

37:21.201 --> 37:23.681
and we don't have the
slightest idea why it's there.

37:23.681 --> 37:27.681
(fast paced instrumental music)

37:39.641 --> 37:41.641
- You can never imagine.

37:42.521 --> 37:44.361
You can try, but you
can never really imagine

37:44.361 --> 37:47.281
what mother nature will actually

37:47.281 --> 37:49.081
have in store

37:49.081 --> 37:50.641
when you get there.

37:50.641 --> 37:54.801
(static)
(fast paced music)

37:57.641 --> 38:00.241
It seems like time really flew.

38:02.881 --> 38:06.121
- I don't think we really
fully understood (laughs)

38:06.121 --> 38:07.881
before the first Jupiter encounter,

38:07.881 --> 38:09.681
just how intense it was going to be.

38:09.681 --> 38:10.841
No, we didn't.

38:12.841 --> 38:13.841
We found out.

38:13.841 --> 38:16.081
(laughter)

38:16.961 --> 38:18.481
- It's an interesting phenomena that you

38:18.481 --> 38:21.281
start working on a mission in 1972,

38:21.281 --> 38:23.481
you launch in 1977.

38:23.481 --> 38:25.921
All of that, there's no science.

38:25.921 --> 38:27.601
It's all getting ready.

38:27.601 --> 38:30.681
And then March 79, the flood.

38:30.681 --> 38:33.281
(solemn music)

38:45.761 --> 38:50.121
- [Narrator] The encounters,
they creep up on you.

38:50.121 --> 38:52.441
We started what we call
the observatory phase

38:52.441 --> 38:54.601
with our long telephoto camera,

38:54.601 --> 38:57.321
and that's when we
started seeing day by day

38:57.321 --> 39:00.081
larger and larger Jupiter.

39:00.081 --> 39:01.961
- [Narrator] When we were
approaching, every picture

39:01.961 --> 39:05.441
was the greatest picture
ever taken of Jupiter.

39:05.441 --> 39:08.161
- [Narrator] In the beginning,
it would be just a little dot

39:08.161 --> 39:10.321
getting bigger on the screen every day.

39:10.321 --> 39:13.241
And as we would get closer and closer,

39:13.241 --> 39:15.921
the images became more dramatic.

39:16.921 --> 39:19.121
- [Narrator] Incredibly
strange, and beautiful,

39:19.121 --> 39:23.281
and now by Voyager revealed
in all of it's splendour.

39:25.961 --> 39:27.641
- [Narrator] We were trying to get as much

39:27.641 --> 39:29.201
detail as possible.

39:29.201 --> 39:32.961
So a narrow angle camera
was 1500 millimetres

39:33.801 --> 39:37.641
and the wide angle camera
was 200 millimetres.

39:38.681 --> 39:40.081
- Would someone care to speculate

39:40.081 --> 39:42.521
what you would say to Galileo Galilei

39:42.521 --> 39:44.641
if he walked into the room today?

39:44.641 --> 39:45.481
(faint laughter)

39:45.481 --> 39:47.961
- How are you able to live so long?

39:47.961 --> 39:50.201
(laughter)

39:54.201 --> 39:55.521
- I think Galileo.

39:55.521 --> 39:57.441
- Jupiter is more than 10
times the diameter of earth.

39:57.441 --> 39:58.681
It's huge!

39:58.681 --> 39:59.961
And it's mainly hydrogen and helium.

39:59.961 --> 40:01.801
There are no solid
surface on these planets.

40:01.801 --> 40:05.521
These planets are liquid
gas and liquid deep inside.

40:05.521 --> 40:08.121
- The gas is compressed
the farther down you go

40:08.121 --> 40:10.441
and it gets very hot indeed.

40:12.281 --> 40:14.641
You would melt, vaporise in fact,

40:14.641 --> 40:17.521
if you tried to fly through Jupiter.

40:17.521 --> 40:19.401
- Let me first modify your statement.

40:19.401 --> 40:20.521
Not that it was wrong.

40:20.521 --> 40:22.521
- The atmospheric scientists

40:22.521 --> 40:25.161
got long-range views
because we weren't looking

40:25.161 --> 40:29.161
at tiny moons, we were
looking at the big planet,

40:29.161 --> 40:31.041
and so we could see things going on

40:31.041 --> 40:34.561
before the other groups could see things.

40:34.561 --> 40:38.441
And we were always the
first to start shouting.

40:39.481 --> 40:43.801
- [Narrator] Even to this day
we don't fly colour detectors.

40:43.801 --> 40:46.001
You get a much higher-resolution

40:46.001 --> 40:47.721
image in black and white.

40:47.721 --> 40:49.521
And so when we want to make colour,

40:49.521 --> 40:51.001
we take them through different filters

40:51.001 --> 40:52.761
and then on the ground you put it together

40:52.761 --> 40:55.601
and make a colour image out of it.

40:55.601 --> 40:57.881
- That acceleration as
you're approaching encounters

40:57.881 --> 41:00.281
is really something that
becomes very, very exciting.

41:00.281 --> 41:02.321
We called it drinking out
of a fire hose, you know,

41:02.321 --> 41:03.601
you're trying to take a little sip,

41:03.601 --> 41:06.041
and this torrent of data is coming out.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.721
(fast paced music)

41:08.721 --> 41:11.201
- You go to Jupiter and you
have a storm that's been

41:11.201 --> 41:13.201
around for more than 300 years,

41:13.201 --> 41:14.881
that's the Great Red Spot.

41:14.881 --> 41:18.161
You could fit two or
three Earth's inside it.

41:18.161 --> 41:19.841
So here's the Great Red
Spot and here's an earth

41:19.841 --> 41:21.561
and here's an earth.

41:21.561 --> 41:23.801
It's always going around.

41:23.801 --> 41:27.401
And I sort of assumed that the flow around

41:27.401 --> 41:29.481
these giant things would be

41:29.481 --> 41:31.641
smooth like honey.

41:31.641 --> 41:35.201
But, when Voyager started
getting close-up images,

41:35.201 --> 41:37.641
we realised that it was very active.

41:37.641 --> 41:39.641
And that deepened the mystery

41:39.641 --> 41:42.561
of how these big storms could even exist

41:42.561 --> 41:43.641
with all this

41:44.961 --> 41:46.681
turbulence going on.

41:46.681 --> 41:50.561
- It was swallowing up clouds
and spitting out others.

41:50.561 --> 41:52.841
We knew that it was a vortex,

41:52.841 --> 41:55.041
but to see it in action...

41:58.441 --> 41:59.441
- [Narrator] Every day you're wondering

41:59.441 --> 42:01.081
"Did we build the spacecraft well enough?

42:01.081 --> 42:03.401
"Did we anticipate all the possible things

42:03.401 --> 42:05.241
"that could go wrong?"

42:07.041 --> 42:09.201
- Pioneer 10 had to measure
the radiation environment

42:09.201 --> 42:11.361
which was much greater than our

42:11.361 --> 42:13.761
earth based interpretation suggested.

42:13.761 --> 42:16.441
(ominous music)

42:19.721 --> 42:22.121
- You're approaching
this monster essentially.

42:22.121 --> 42:23.721
This monster magnetic field,

42:23.721 --> 42:26.641
this monster radiation
environment on purpose,

42:26.641 --> 42:28.161
because you need to get close

42:28.161 --> 42:29.641
because you want to see
all the little moons,

42:29.641 --> 42:31.401
and the clouds, and the storms,

42:31.401 --> 42:33.761
and you want to slingshot on to Saturn.

42:33.761 --> 42:37.041
But you just don't know if
you're going to survive.

42:37.041 --> 42:38.281
Thing gets fried, you lose the mission.

42:38.281 --> 42:40.121
Still out there physically
intact probably,

42:40.121 --> 42:44.001
but unable to communicate
with it, the mission's over.

42:44.001 --> 42:47.601
- Two months before shipping
to the Cape for launch,

42:47.601 --> 42:49.761
the scientists were predicting

42:49.761 --> 42:52.881
that the magnetic fields around Jupiter

42:52.881 --> 42:54.441
were intense enough that they

42:54.441 --> 42:57.361
would accelerate particles.

42:57.361 --> 43:00.881
Whoa, we were hearing
initially 40,000 volts,

43:00.881 --> 43:04.081
that would be the end of our spacecraft.

43:04.081 --> 43:07.121
Cabling on these
appendages were conductors

43:07.121 --> 43:09.201
that would take these destroying pulses

43:09.201 --> 43:12.961
and just feed them right
into our systems and kill us,

43:12.961 --> 43:15.801
so we needed to ground everything.

43:16.681 --> 43:17.601
We didn't have time

43:17.601 --> 43:20.321
to go through the normal design reviews,

43:20.321 --> 43:22.081
so in order to get this

43:22.081 --> 43:24.121
protection done quickly enough,

43:24.121 --> 43:26.761
an ad hoc team was formed

43:26.761 --> 43:29.121
and we did some things that
were out of the ordinary,

43:29.121 --> 43:31.761
very out of the ordinary.

43:31.761 --> 43:34.001
I can remember asking
one of the technicians

43:34.001 --> 43:36.681
to go out and buy aluminium foil.

43:37.561 --> 43:40.161
It was the only material
that was available to us.

43:40.161 --> 43:43.521
Normally our procurement of spacecraft

43:43.521 --> 43:47.281
hardware supplies,
materials, are a much more

43:48.961 --> 43:50.801
sophisticated process.

43:51.721 --> 43:53.641
We're all in bunny suits actually

43:53.641 --> 43:55.921
cutting continuous strips

43:55.921 --> 43:59.401
and then cleaning them
with wipes and alcohol.

43:59.401 --> 44:01.961
And then finally wrapping these on all of

44:01.961 --> 44:04.121
our exterior cabling.

44:04.121 --> 44:08.721
But yeah, same materials
in your Christmas turkey.

44:08.721 --> 44:11.161
I don't think we created
any shortage per se.

44:11.161 --> 44:13.041
It may have been a local shortage

44:13.041 --> 44:15.681
in the local grocery store for a few days

44:15.681 --> 44:17.721
until they reordered right.

44:17.721 --> 44:20.001
Your turkey wrapping
is protecting Voyager,

44:20.001 --> 44:23.041
and now fast forward, you know,

44:23.041 --> 44:26.041
did we know whether we had done enough?

44:26.041 --> 44:29.281
(high pitched beeping)

44:34.481 --> 44:37.201
- Amazingly we hear all kinds of sounds.

44:37.201 --> 44:39.601
It's a very curious phenomenon.

44:39.601 --> 44:41.361
You don't expect the molecules up in the

44:41.361 --> 44:43.561
corner of a room to suddenly get together

44:43.561 --> 44:45.641
and start whistling at you.

44:45.641 --> 44:48.961
But in a plasma, in this radiation belt,

44:50.201 --> 44:52.241
that can happen.

44:52.241 --> 44:53.881
- [Narrator] I'm gonna call
them radio sounds because

44:53.881 --> 44:56.241
we have to detect them with antennas.

44:56.241 --> 44:58.761
- If you had the right kind
of antennas on your ears

44:58.761 --> 45:00.561
you could go out and hear what we record.

45:00.561 --> 45:02.721
(beeping)

45:03.801 --> 45:05.201
- Whistlers.

45:05.201 --> 45:09.201
These things that go,
(imitates whistle) like that.

45:09.201 --> 45:10.921
Yeah, whistlers mean lightning.

45:10.921 --> 45:12.561
That was the first detection of lightning

45:12.561 --> 45:14.841
on a planet other than Earth.

45:14.841 --> 45:15.881
Much more intense.

45:15.881 --> 45:17.881
There are lightning flashes at Jupiter

45:17.881 --> 45:20.201
that would go halfway from the east coast

45:20.201 --> 45:22.841
of the United States to the west coast.

45:22.841 --> 45:26.361
So it's fascinating
what you hear in space.

45:26.361 --> 45:29.281
(fast paced music)

45:30.561 --> 45:32.401
- [Narrator] When you're
on a flyby mission

45:32.401 --> 45:35.161
there ain't no second chance.

45:35.161 --> 45:36.441
- We were getting pictures,

45:36.441 --> 45:37.841
they were getting better and better.

45:37.841 --> 45:39.721
And you could begin to see detail

45:39.721 --> 45:41.761
as these moons got bigger.

45:41.761 --> 45:42.921
You know the dread you have

45:42.921 --> 45:44.521
is that you don't want to see

45:44.521 --> 45:46.521
a lot of worlds that
look like Earth's moon.

45:46.521 --> 45:48.921
Let's face it, it's dull.

45:48.921 --> 45:51.721
- Our mind's eye was oh
yeah, we're gonna see

45:51.721 --> 45:54.361
battered ice balls and so forth.

45:55.401 --> 45:59.081
When we saw Callisto, basically
it's totally hammered right?

45:59.081 --> 46:01.001
Saturated with impact craters.

46:01.001 --> 46:03.201
Ganymede shows a lot of interesting

46:03.201 --> 46:05.121
grooves and ridges.

46:05.121 --> 46:07.841
But it's pretty blasted
with impact craters.

46:07.841 --> 46:11.081
And then as we went into the inner two.

46:12.201 --> 46:15.041
- You could not see craters
on either one of them.

46:15.041 --> 46:16.441
Well this was encouraging,

46:16.441 --> 46:18.721
because now we think maybe this mission

46:18.721 --> 46:22.041
is going to find a lot of diversity.

46:22.041 --> 46:26.841
- Discovering this billiard
ball, smooth, icy crust

46:26.841 --> 46:28.881
of Europa with cracks in it

46:28.881 --> 46:31.081
and what looked like plates of ice

46:31.081 --> 46:33.561
that might be moving
relative to each other,

46:33.561 --> 46:34.801
the best explanation for that

46:34.801 --> 46:36.281
is that there's a thick ocean

46:36.281 --> 46:37.921
of liquid water, salty water

46:37.921 --> 46:40.081
underneath that icy crust.

46:41.321 --> 46:43.721
More ocean water than on the entire Earth,

46:43.721 --> 46:44.961
probably two or three times.

46:44.961 --> 46:46.841
It's the largest ocean in the solar system

46:46.841 --> 46:49.001
in a moon going around Jupiter.

46:49.001 --> 46:51.161
- And then of course, you
know, kind of the showstopper

46:51.161 --> 46:54.041
for Voyager, we get to Io.

46:54.041 --> 46:54.881
- [Narrator] Io, of course,

46:54.881 --> 46:56.361
Io was the star of the show

46:56.361 --> 46:58.121
and we didn't learn that

46:58.121 --> 47:00.281
until after the encounter.

47:01.721 --> 47:03.321
- [Narrator] Everyone had gone home,

47:03.321 --> 47:06.721
and Linda Morabito, an engineer whose job

47:06.721 --> 47:08.881
was to find out the positioning

47:08.881 --> 47:10.561
and the orbit of the spacecraft,

47:10.561 --> 47:13.441
noticed some bumps on images of Io.

47:14.961 --> 47:16.441
- I was on the mission

47:16.441 --> 47:18.681
as a mission navigator,

47:18.681 --> 47:21.641
and our job involved just looking back

47:21.641 --> 47:24.321
over the shoulder of the spacecraft

47:24.321 --> 47:27.801
to say, "Okay, one more picture
of the realm of Jupiter."

47:27.801 --> 47:30.801
So it wasn't high-priority work.

47:30.801 --> 47:33.841
- It was an optical navigation image,

47:33.841 --> 47:37.601
and Linda saw this
strange thing on the limb.

47:38.721 --> 47:42.601
- An enormous object emerged, enormous.

47:42.601 --> 47:45.841
And the first thing I said
to myself, "What is that?!"

47:45.841 --> 47:49.521
And I'm like it looks
like another satellite

47:50.801 --> 47:54.761
in the picture emerging from behind Io.

47:54.761 --> 47:56.801
An object that size,

47:56.801 --> 47:58.561
at that range, at that distance,

47:58.561 --> 47:59.881
would have been seen from Earth,

47:59.881 --> 48:02.361
it was sufficiently large.

48:02.361 --> 48:03.921
I felt with certainty,

48:03.921 --> 48:05.001
it's the only thing I knew,

48:05.001 --> 48:08.641
that I was seeing something
that had never been seen before.

48:08.641 --> 48:11.401
This was an umbrella-shaped plume

48:12.601 --> 48:14.361
rising 250 kilometres

48:16.081 --> 48:18.241
above the surface of Io

48:18.241 --> 48:20.521
with volcanic activity.

48:20.521 --> 48:23.441
(soft piano music)

48:24.401 --> 48:26.881
I found the very first evidence

48:26.881 --> 48:29.201
of active volcanism

48:29.201 --> 48:31.561
on a world beyond the Earth.

48:35.441 --> 48:37.561
- It was so hard to
believe that a little moon

48:37.561 --> 48:39.681
could have 10 times the
volcanic activity of Earth,

48:39.681 --> 48:41.401
which was the only known active volcanoes

48:41.401 --> 48:43.521
in the solar system were here on Earth.

48:43.521 --> 48:44.681
And then there's Io.

48:44.681 --> 48:47.041
Suddenly we had realised

48:47.041 --> 48:49.481
this was a different journey we were on.

48:49.481 --> 48:50.521
- I wanted to say one other thing.

48:50.521 --> 48:51.881
We've been saying that
perhaps there's some

48:51.881 --> 48:53.641
funny way in which Jupiter gobbles up

48:53.641 --> 48:55.121
all the things that are coming in

48:55.121 --> 48:57.121
and it doesn't let Io be hit by any.

48:57.121 --> 49:00.721
Well, we aimed a spacecraft
and went very close.

49:00.721 --> 49:02.321
Had we missed we would have made

49:02.321 --> 49:03.601
the first impact crater.

49:03.601 --> 49:05.361
(laughter)

49:05.361 --> 49:07.361
- The flyby is basically

49:08.401 --> 49:12.281
a week-long affair that's 24 hours a day.

49:12.281 --> 49:13.761
It's intense.

49:13.761 --> 49:16.001
- [Narrator] There will
be a Voyager report

49:16.001 --> 49:17.841
in 30 seconds.

49:17.841 --> 49:20.281
(rock music)

49:26.441 --> 49:28.241
- [Narrator] Instant science
because there's gonna be

49:28.241 --> 49:29.481
a press conference that night.

49:29.481 --> 49:30.641
This picture comes down,

49:30.641 --> 49:32.001
and you've got three hours

49:32.001 --> 49:33.441
to figure out what's going on

49:33.441 --> 49:35.201
and then tell the world about it.

49:35.201 --> 49:37.121
Oh, no pressure there, right?

49:37.121 --> 49:38.481
(heavy guitar music)

49:38.481 --> 49:40.761
- [Narrator] The confines
of being a piece of biology

49:40.761 --> 49:41.681
got in the way of that.

49:41.681 --> 49:42.561
I mean, you got hungry,

49:42.561 --> 49:43.761
you got tired, you know,

49:43.761 --> 49:44.841
you had to go to the bathroom,

49:44.841 --> 49:46.641
I mean, you're going to miss something!

49:46.641 --> 49:48.201
You don't want to miss anything

49:48.201 --> 49:50.641
because every 48 seconds a
new image would come down.

49:50.641 --> 49:53.721
(heavy guitar music)

49:55.241 --> 49:56.481
- [Narrator] No one got any sleep

49:56.481 --> 49:58.081
during one of these flybys

49:58.081 --> 50:01.001
when the spacecraft would go zooming past.

50:01.001 --> 50:04.481
The photo labs were working day and night,

50:04.481 --> 50:07.081
and people were sleeping in their cars.

50:07.081 --> 50:10.161
(heavy guitar music)

50:13.001 --> 50:16.921
- [Narrator] It was just
way too exciting to sleep.

50:16.921 --> 50:20.001
(heavy guitar music)

50:47.161 --> 50:48.441
- [Narrator] This is the first picture

50:48.441 --> 50:50.321
every of Jupiter's ring.

50:50.321 --> 50:53.201
(slow paced music)

50:56.521 --> 50:58.801
- [Narrator] Jupiter was
really just wonderful.

50:58.801 --> 51:01.961
It was just discovery after discovery.

51:03.441 --> 51:05.321
- You don't get something for free.

51:05.321 --> 51:07.561
Energy and momentum have to be conserved.

51:07.561 --> 51:11.801
So when Voyager picked up
35,000 miles an hour of speed,

51:11.801 --> 51:15.161
you actually, during that swingby,

51:15.161 --> 51:17.721
slowed Jupiter in it's orbit

51:17.721 --> 51:20.281
by one foot per trillion years.

51:22.401 --> 51:23.561
- Jupiter was a game-changer.

51:23.561 --> 51:25.561
Jupiter reset all the registers.

51:25.561 --> 51:28.561
Now we're really up for something.

51:28.561 --> 51:30.201
And to know that this was just the very,

51:30.201 --> 51:32.521
very beginning of this journey.

51:32.521 --> 51:34.001
If we're blown away by Jupiter,

51:34.001 --> 51:36.521
just wait until we get to Saturn.

51:36.521 --> 51:40.241
(slow paced music)

51:40.241 --> 51:43.001
- Voyager to me was Homeric.

51:43.001 --> 51:44.921
It was years of passing

51:45.801 --> 51:48.361
across the solar system
from one planet to the other

51:48.361 --> 51:50.081
and then it was a week or two

51:50.081 --> 51:54.281
of frenzied activity, and
discovery, and conquest,

51:54.281 --> 51:56.361
and then it was, well, back in the boats,

51:56.361 --> 52:00.081
oars in the water and then
on to the next conquest.

52:00.081 --> 52:02.881
(faint heartbeat)

52:09.721 --> 52:11.481
- My father was Carl Sagan,

52:11.481 --> 52:14.001
and my mother is Linda Salzman Sagan,

52:14.001 --> 52:16.321
and she's a writer and an
artist and she designed

52:16.321 --> 52:18.241
the iconic Pioneer plaque.

52:18.241 --> 52:19.561
She actually drew it,

52:19.561 --> 52:21.641
and she's the one who
got all the greetings

52:21.641 --> 52:24.161
for the Voyager Golden Record.

52:24.161 --> 52:25.001
I like to think of her,

52:25.001 --> 52:26.161
that she kind of put together

52:26.161 --> 52:30.561
a kind of a choir of voices
of greetings to the stars.

52:30.561 --> 52:32.721
(chatter)

52:38.081 --> 52:39.881
My parents wanted a child

52:39.881 --> 52:42.081
to have a voice of one of the voices.

52:42.081 --> 52:43.521
And they just came to me one day

52:43.521 --> 52:45.401
and said, "Nick, if you'd
like to leave a message

52:45.401 --> 52:47.241
"to aliens if they happen to exist,

52:47.241 --> 52:49.441
"what would you like to say to them?"

52:49.441 --> 52:52.641
(loud thuds)
(clanking)

52:52.641 --> 52:55.801
Hello from the children of planet earth.

52:55.801 --> 52:57.281
"Oh, hello from the
children of planet earth."

52:57.281 --> 53:00.041
That's what I would say to aliens.

53:00.041 --> 53:04.401
They loved that and so they
said, "Great, let's record you."

53:04.401 --> 53:06.441
It's a bit of a blur.

53:06.441 --> 53:07.761
Like the only thing that I know

53:07.761 --> 53:08.961
that I remember from that time

53:08.961 --> 53:11.001
is those knobs and the
little recording level

53:11.001 --> 53:13.201
that goes into the red
if you speak too much.

53:13.201 --> 53:15.441
This 70s, kind of...

53:15.441 --> 53:17.281
So I remember that,
and I remember watching

53:17.281 --> 53:19.961
the needle move as I spoke
and seeing where it got.

53:19.961 --> 53:21.001
Oh, that got close to the red

53:21.001 --> 53:22.001
but actually didn't go into the red,

53:22.001 --> 53:23.441
okay, that's probably good.

53:23.441 --> 53:27.241
And this not so great
handwriting from age six.

53:27.241 --> 53:28.361
Not that it's so much better now.

53:28.361 --> 53:30.641
It says "Hello from the
children of Plan-et Earth."

53:30.641 --> 53:32.081
I think I have a little hyphen because

53:32.081 --> 53:33.921
I ran out of space for planet.

53:33.921 --> 53:35.801
And the I was drawing something that

53:35.801 --> 53:37.681
I think I thought later was a tree

53:37.681 --> 53:39.121
but other people told
me it was a rocket ship.

53:39.121 --> 53:42.001
And I think I was more
focused on my crappy drawing

53:42.001 --> 53:44.201
than I was in whatever performance

53:44.201 --> 53:46.961
of how I was gonna say this line.

53:47.801 --> 53:48.641
And that was that.

53:48.641 --> 53:50.081
And then I, you know,

53:50.081 --> 53:54.121
drank my apple juice and
went back to my books.

53:54.121 --> 53:56.201
It was really not till considerably later

53:56.201 --> 53:57.441
that the kind of enormity of

53:57.441 --> 54:00.041
what that meant actually hit me.

54:00.041 --> 54:03.681
(speaking foreign language)

54:11.121 --> 54:13.121
- The reason I was chosen was that because

54:13.121 --> 54:14.641
I'm something special.

54:14.641 --> 54:16.881
I happen to be there at the right time

54:16.881 --> 54:18.041
at the right place.

54:18.041 --> 54:21.001
And people knew that I speak Arabic.

54:21.001 --> 54:22.921
So I was lucky.

54:22.921 --> 54:23.761
- I said "Why me?"

54:23.761 --> 54:27.241
They said "Because you
speak fluent Portuguese."

54:27.241 --> 54:29.281
- [Narrator] I didn't get any instructions

54:29.281 --> 54:31.201
about what to say.

54:31.201 --> 54:33.281
Except that it needs to be short.

54:33.281 --> 54:35.161
- The greetings to the
universe are almost like

54:35.161 --> 54:37.321
proto tweets, the first tweets.

54:37.321 --> 54:39.281
Keep it short, keep it simple.

54:39.281 --> 54:42.321
And I had about five minutes warning

54:42.321 --> 54:44.161
before I was recorded.

54:45.081 --> 54:47.601
They said, "We're making a record

54:47.601 --> 54:49.641
"to go aboard a spacecraft."

54:49.641 --> 54:52.281
And that was very intimidating.

54:52.281 --> 54:55.921
(speaking foreign language)

54:57.841 --> 54:59.321
It's not like there's a rule book

54:59.321 --> 55:00.561
for what you should say

55:00.561 --> 55:02.801
when you're greeting the universe.

55:02.801 --> 55:06.481
(speaking foreign language)

55:09.561 --> 55:12.641
Which means peace and
happiness to everybody.

55:12.641 --> 55:15.121
It seemed like a safe thing to say

55:15.121 --> 55:17.401
if you ran across some aliens.

55:17.401 --> 55:21.561
Rather than saying take me
to your leader or whatever.

55:22.521 --> 55:26.201
(speaking foreign language)

55:29.521 --> 55:31.961
- Because equipment is cold,

55:31.961 --> 55:34.481
the spaceship is inanimate.

55:34.481 --> 55:37.481
Even the record itself is metal.

55:37.481 --> 55:40.561
I just wanted my voice to convey warmth

55:40.561 --> 55:42.241
and to make contact.

55:49.361 --> 55:53.841
And it means greetings to
our friends in the sky.

55:53.841 --> 55:56.241
We long to meet you some day.

55:59.161 --> 56:02.001
(foreign chatter)

56:05.201 --> 56:07.121
- [Narrator] There is some piece of me

56:07.121 --> 56:09.441
that is a traveller on that ship.

56:09.441 --> 56:11.361
It's just gone, it's just going.

56:11.361 --> 56:12.961
Continues to go, it's gonna keep going.

56:12.961 --> 56:15.921
When I'm long long gone it'll keep going.

56:15.921 --> 56:18.081
And it's like a little piece of magic.

56:18.081 --> 56:21.441
Hello from the children of planet earth.

56:23.121 --> 56:24.401
♫ In your mind

56:24.401 --> 56:28.321
♫ You have capacities you know

56:29.561 --> 56:32.121
♫ To telepath messages

56:32.121 --> 56:35.281
♫ Through the vast unknown

56:35.281 --> 56:36.921
♫ Please close your eyes

56:36.921 --> 56:38.761
♫ And concentrate

56:38.761 --> 56:43.401
♫ With every thought you think

56:43.401 --> 56:45.921
♫ Upon the recitation

56:45.921 --> 56:49.121
♫ We're about to sing

56:52.121 --> 56:54.401
♫ Calling occupants

56:54.401 --> 56:56.641
♫ Of interplanetary craft

56:56.641 --> 56:57.841
- [Narrator] I'd like to know the answer.

56:57.841 --> 56:58.881
Are we alone?

56:58.881 --> 57:01.441
I'd like to know the
answer to that question.

57:01.441 --> 57:03.641
- There has to be other civilizations.

57:03.641 --> 57:06.241
The numbers just compel it.

57:06.241 --> 57:07.961
But it would be almost
statistically impossible

57:07.961 --> 57:09.521
for there not to be

57:10.521 --> 57:12.681
other life forms and other life forms

57:12.681 --> 57:16.841
that have evolved to a state
of intelligence and beyond.

57:18.321 --> 57:19.241
- The bigger you think space is,

57:19.241 --> 57:22.641
the more probability there
is that they're there.

57:22.641 --> 57:24.801
The less probable it is
you're gonna find them

57:24.801 --> 57:29.241
'cause they're needles
in infinite haystacks.

57:29.241 --> 57:31.681
♫ And one night we'll make

57:31.681 --> 57:34.721
♫ A contact with you

57:34.721 --> 57:37.041
- I tell you, I think
that intelligent life,

57:37.041 --> 57:39.641
if we can include ourselves in it.

57:39.641 --> 57:40.841
In that categorization.

57:40.841 --> 57:42.561
Is so prevalent that I'll

57:42.561 --> 57:44.681
bet you at this very instant

57:44.681 --> 57:46.321
there are two people.

57:46.321 --> 57:48.561
Probably one male and one female

57:48.561 --> 57:50.281
having exactly the same conversation

57:50.281 --> 57:52.401
that you and I are having right now.

57:52.401 --> 57:56.561
I think that's how prevalent
life is in the universe.

58:00.001 --> 58:03.801
- They're probably trying to
contact us at this very minute.

58:03.801 --> 58:07.041
I predict passing through
this room right now

58:07.041 --> 58:10.161
radio messages that we could detect

58:10.161 --> 58:11.841
with equipment we could build

58:11.841 --> 58:15.001
if we knew where to aim that detector

58:15.001 --> 58:17.481
and what frequency to tune to.

58:19.081 --> 58:20.521
And it's right here in this room.

58:20.521 --> 58:22.801
And it's mind boggling.

58:22.801 --> 58:25.721
They're here, they're right
in the room right now.

58:25.721 --> 58:29.401
(slow paced music)

58:29.401 --> 58:31.441
- [Narrator] The big division
with extraterrestrial life

58:31.441 --> 58:33.361
is not space it's time.

58:36.041 --> 58:39.041
- [Narrator] It depends
ultimately on how long

58:39.041 --> 58:40.961
our civilization lasts.

58:40.961 --> 58:43.961
And how long civilizations last because

58:43.961 --> 58:45.241
you've got to get them to overlap

58:45.241 --> 58:47.081
for us to communicate.

58:49.121 --> 58:51.921
- In our galaxy, our
Sun is relatively young.

58:51.921 --> 58:53.921
He's about 12 million years old,

58:53.921 --> 58:55.121
our Sun is four and a
half billion years old.

58:55.121 --> 58:56.641
There are many stars that are a lot older.

58:56.641 --> 58:58.001
Therefore you could have imagined some

58:58.001 --> 58:59.801
civilization around such a star that might

58:59.801 --> 59:01.321
have watched our Earth form

59:01.321 --> 59:02.681
over the last four and
a half billion years.

59:02.681 --> 59:04.521
Well, over that last four
and a half billion years,

59:04.521 --> 59:06.921
the only evidence of intelligent life

59:06.921 --> 59:08.521
would have been in the last 50 or 60 years

59:08.521 --> 59:10.241
by watching Star Trek or I Love Lucy

59:10.241 --> 59:12.081
or whatever signals we sent out.

59:12.081 --> 59:13.081
So even if you knew,

59:13.081 --> 59:15.881
even if someone told
you look at that star,

59:15.881 --> 59:17.801
and then look at the
third rock from that star,

59:17.801 --> 59:18.921
and that's where you're
going to find life.

59:18.921 --> 59:21.641
Even if they knew which
object to look for,

59:21.641 --> 59:23.201
there's only a 50-year period

59:23.201 --> 59:25.081
over five billion years almost

59:25.081 --> 59:28.841
where you'd be able to
find intelligent life.

59:30.481 --> 59:32.961
- If we're alone then we're truly unique,

59:32.961 --> 59:35.321
and how did that happen and why us

59:35.321 --> 59:36.881
and how are we so special

59:36.881 --> 59:38.921
and yet in such a kind of far-flung

59:38.921 --> 59:41.041
kind of humdrum part of the universe?

59:41.041 --> 59:43.601
And if we're not alone,
how did we all get here

59:43.601 --> 59:44.921
and can we learn about ourselves

59:44.921 --> 59:46.841
by these other groups out there?

59:46.841 --> 59:49.161
What are they like and
are they the creatures

59:49.161 --> 59:52.561
of our dreams or our nightmares?

59:52.561 --> 59:54.281
- I think what's gonna save us is that

59:54.281 --> 59:57.241
interstellar travel is
much harder than we think.

59:57.241 --> 1:00:00.201
And we're safe for quite a
long time from the aliens

1:00:00.201 --> 1:00:03.801
'cause they don't know how
to travel very far either.

1:00:03.801 --> 1:00:07.321
We're all sort of stuck
on the planets we've got.

1:00:07.321 --> 1:00:10.001
(ominous music)

1:00:17.601 --> 1:00:19.041
- The thing about the Voyager mission

1:00:19.041 --> 1:00:21.441
from Jupiter to Saturn was the short

1:00:21.441 --> 1:00:23.601
space between those.

1:00:23.601 --> 1:00:25.481
Jupiter to Saturn went just like that.

1:00:25.481 --> 1:00:27.001
It was really quick.

1:00:27.001 --> 1:00:29.921
(slow paced music)

1:00:35.121 --> 1:00:37.441
It's easy to think of
Jupiter as the bully,

1:00:37.441 --> 1:00:40.281
it's the alpha male of the solar system.

1:00:40.281 --> 1:00:41.561
No question.

1:00:41.561 --> 1:00:45.001
I think Saturn is majestic with rings

1:00:45.001 --> 1:00:48.841
giving that sense of beauty and serenity.

1:00:48.841 --> 1:00:52.041
And the moon's sort of subservient

1:00:52.041 --> 1:00:54.201
and somewhat pushed aside.

1:00:55.281 --> 1:00:56.921
- [Narrator] We started
off with images that were

1:00:56.921 --> 1:00:59.761
probably no better than what
you can get from the ground.

1:00:59.761 --> 1:01:01.561
And then it keeps getting
better and better and better

1:01:01.561 --> 1:01:03.641
as you get closer and closer.

1:01:03.641 --> 1:01:07.241
What are we going to see
when we get really close?

1:01:07.241 --> 1:01:09.001
- [Narrator] Having seen
Saturn in a telescope

1:01:09.001 --> 1:01:11.201
with the rings just looking
like these little tiny ears

1:01:11.201 --> 1:01:13.761
on either side, to now seeing detail

1:01:13.761 --> 1:01:15.601
and the beauty of Saturn's rings.

1:01:15.601 --> 1:01:17.401
You know, looking like,
almost like the grooves

1:01:17.401 --> 1:01:19.121
on a phonograph record.

1:01:19.121 --> 1:01:21.881
- [Narrator] The rings
of Saturn, what are they?

1:01:21.881 --> 1:01:23.641
Billions of icy particles,

1:01:23.641 --> 1:01:25.881
some the size of a house.

1:01:25.881 --> 1:01:26.961
They're enormous, much wider

1:01:26.961 --> 1:01:29.041
than many Earth's strung together

1:01:29.041 --> 1:01:32.201
but less than a kilometre thick.

1:01:32.201 --> 1:01:34.961
- We get there and we
find that it's a blizzard

1:01:34.961 --> 1:01:37.001
of features throughout the rings,

1:01:37.001 --> 1:01:39.641
and it got very complex.

1:01:39.641 --> 1:01:42.561
(slow paced music)

1:01:52.121 --> 1:01:54.481
We become junkies (laughs).

1:01:54.481 --> 1:01:55.841
Who, this is how you become

1:01:55.841 --> 1:01:58.401
a planetary flyby junkie,

1:01:58.401 --> 1:01:59.601
it's because you've gone through

1:01:59.601 --> 1:02:01.241
one of them and you just know
it's the greatest feeling

1:02:01.241 --> 1:02:04.441
and you want to keep
doing it again and again.

1:02:04.441 --> 1:02:05.761
- At some point,

1:02:06.881 --> 1:02:08.121
perhaps a year or so from now

1:02:08.121 --> 1:02:09.641
it may be possible to put all this

1:02:09.641 --> 1:02:11.081
into perspective.

1:02:12.161 --> 1:02:14.441
But right at the moment,

1:02:14.441 --> 1:02:16.961
I cannot recall being in such a

1:02:16.961 --> 1:02:21.881
state euphoria for any
previous planetary encounter.

1:02:21.881 --> 1:02:24.641
Including our two remarkable

1:02:24.641 --> 1:02:27.361
Voyager encounters at Jupiter.

1:02:27.361 --> 1:02:30.281
(slow paced music)

1:02:57.481 --> 1:02:58.761
- [Narrator] The largest moon of Saturn,

1:02:58.761 --> 1:03:01.161
Titan's the most extraordinary place.

1:03:01.161 --> 1:03:03.841
There's a dense methane atmosphere

1:03:03.841 --> 1:03:06.321
where a complex organic
chemistry has been going on

1:03:06.321 --> 1:03:07.921
for perhaps billions of years,

1:03:07.921 --> 1:03:12.841
and we are in a moment of
extraordinary discovery.

1:03:12.841 --> 1:03:15.121
- We had both spacecraft programmed

1:03:15.121 --> 1:03:17.601
to do identical missions at Saturn,

1:03:17.601 --> 1:03:19.241
and that was the prime mission

1:03:19.241 --> 1:03:21.081
and it involved Titan.

1:03:22.201 --> 1:03:23.601
- There's a huge amount
amount of scientific interest

1:03:23.601 --> 1:03:25.201
in Titan because many people think

1:03:25.201 --> 1:03:26.521
that early in our own history,

1:03:26.521 --> 1:03:28.161
our own planet may have been like that

1:03:28.161 --> 1:03:31.561
with very little oxygen,
lots of hydrocarbons,

1:03:31.561 --> 1:03:34.441
very thick, different, smoggy atmosphere

1:03:34.441 --> 1:03:37.921
that was changed dramatically
on our planet by life.

1:03:37.921 --> 1:03:39.681
So if you want to understand
the starting conditions,

1:03:39.681 --> 1:03:40.921
go study Titan.

1:03:41.881 --> 1:03:44.641
- [Narrator] If Voyager One
was successful at Titan,

1:03:44.641 --> 1:03:47.921
Voyager Two, which is nine
months behind going to Saturn,

1:03:47.921 --> 1:03:49.921
would be free to continue to

1:03:49.921 --> 1:03:51.681
Uranus and to go on to Neptune.

1:03:51.681 --> 1:03:55.761
But it depended upon Voyager
One succeeding at Titan.

1:03:55.761 --> 1:03:59.041
- Because Voyager One had
to be in a certain place

1:03:59.041 --> 1:04:00.801
in order to pass Titan,

1:04:00.801 --> 1:04:03.361
it couldn't go on to Uranus and Neptune.

1:04:03.361 --> 1:04:05.201
There was just no way
to bend its trajectory

1:04:05.201 --> 1:04:06.881
to go anywhere else.

1:04:07.961 --> 1:04:11.761
- Voyager Two would have
done exactly that same thing

1:04:11.761 --> 1:04:13.921
if Voyager One had failed.

1:04:13.921 --> 1:04:16.801
We would have gone like
this, no more planets.

1:04:16.801 --> 1:04:18.401
- That would have been really tough.

1:04:18.401 --> 1:04:20.201
You gonna try for Titan again

1:04:20.201 --> 1:04:24.681
and give up two other
worlds, Uranus and Neptune?

1:04:24.681 --> 1:04:29.601
- [Narrator] So there was a
lot of pressure on Voyager One.

1:04:29.601 --> 1:04:30.761
- Mostly what we looked at

1:04:30.761 --> 1:04:33.841
was a giant ball of brown smog

1:04:33.841 --> 1:04:37.761
with some sort of electric
blue hazes above it.

1:04:38.921 --> 1:04:40.081
- With the Voyager camera,

1:04:40.081 --> 1:04:43.521
you couldn't see through
the clouds and haze.

1:04:43.521 --> 1:04:46.201
(radio Chatter)

1:04:49.401 --> 1:04:52.081
Now the radio signal from the spacecraft

1:04:52.081 --> 1:04:54.761
passed through the
atmosphere of the planet,

1:04:54.761 --> 1:04:56.321
and that gave them a measure

1:04:56.321 --> 1:04:58.441
of the pressure at the surface

1:04:58.441 --> 1:05:00.721
and also the temperature at the surface.

1:05:00.721 --> 1:05:02.321
And so we learned a lot about

1:05:02.321 --> 1:05:05.441
Titan from that radio signal.

1:05:05.441 --> 1:05:07.201
- [Narrator] Titan did not reveal itself

1:05:07.201 --> 1:05:09.001
to the camera's of the Voyager.

1:05:09.001 --> 1:05:11.241
But the spectrometers and radio science

1:05:11.241 --> 1:05:14.001
made major contributions to the chemistry

1:05:14.001 --> 1:05:17.921
and physics of the
atmosphere and the interior.

1:05:23.001 --> 1:05:24.241
- [Narrator] We had gathered what we could

1:05:24.241 --> 1:05:26.321
with Voyager spacecraft.

1:05:26.321 --> 1:05:28.281
- [Narrator] There was little to be gained

1:05:28.281 --> 1:05:31.281
by doing another close flyby of Titan.

1:05:31.281 --> 1:05:32.681
- Shortly after that,

1:05:32.681 --> 1:05:33.961
NASA Headquarters agreed

1:05:33.961 --> 1:05:35.921
that we should continue with Voyager Two

1:05:35.921 --> 1:05:37.721
on it's Uranus trajectory.

1:05:37.721 --> 1:05:40.121
So Voyager One had succeeded.

1:05:41.721 --> 1:05:43.201
- People don't realise
how we almost didn't

1:05:43.201 --> 1:05:45.441
have that mission to Uranus and Neptune.

1:05:45.441 --> 1:05:47.241
We almost didn't have the Grand Tour

1:05:47.241 --> 1:05:50.921
if not for the success
for Voyager One at Titan.

1:05:50.921 --> 1:05:54.201
- Voyager One was done
and was receding from

1:05:54.201 --> 1:05:56.281
the solar system at an angle above the

1:05:56.281 --> 1:05:58.041
plain of the planets.

1:05:59.081 --> 1:06:01.801
- So Voyager One planetary mission almost

1:06:01.801 --> 1:06:03.281
ended right there.

1:06:04.521 --> 1:06:06.281
Come back to that later.

1:06:06.281 --> 1:06:09.361
(instrumental music)

1:06:17.401 --> 1:06:19.001
We're getting pictures and other data

1:06:19.001 --> 1:06:20.361
back from Voyager Two.

1:06:20.361 --> 1:06:21.721
But at some point in time,

1:06:21.721 --> 1:06:23.521
it had to go behind the planet

1:06:23.521 --> 1:06:25.561
and that blocks us from getting

1:06:25.561 --> 1:06:27.361
radio signals to the earth.

1:06:27.361 --> 1:06:29.441
And that happened to be in
the middle of the night.

1:06:29.441 --> 1:06:31.721
It appeared at times several hours

1:06:31.721 --> 1:06:33.001
that everybody knows we're gonna be out

1:06:33.001 --> 1:06:34.801
of contact with the spacecraft.

1:06:34.801 --> 1:06:37.001
Everybody's expecting
to pop champagne corks

1:06:37.001 --> 1:06:38.561
and say "Hey we made it and all the data's

1:06:38.561 --> 1:06:39.721
"on the tape recorder."

1:06:39.721 --> 1:06:41.521
'Cause it could be
transmitted to the earth.

1:06:41.521 --> 1:06:44.321
And instead it pops out of the other side

1:06:44.321 --> 1:06:46.481
and is all these crazy error signals

1:06:46.481 --> 1:06:47.521
coming from the spacecraft.

1:06:47.521 --> 1:06:48.801
Something bad has happened.

1:06:48.801 --> 1:06:51.281
(beeping)

1:06:51.281 --> 1:06:53.881
- Something happened right
around ring-plane crossing,

1:06:53.881 --> 1:06:55.801
and the images that were
coming back were blank.

1:06:55.801 --> 1:06:58.441
(ominous music)

1:07:00.281 --> 1:07:01.641
- People had thought maybe it crashed

1:07:01.641 --> 1:07:02.921
into the rings of Saturn.

1:07:02.921 --> 1:07:05.241
Is this it, is it dead?

1:07:05.241 --> 1:07:07.801
(solemn music)

1:07:10.561 --> 1:07:14.481
- Ladies and gentlemen
we can start debriefing.

1:07:15.441 --> 1:07:17.921
I wanted to make a very brief statement.

1:07:17.921 --> 1:07:20.801
We do have a problem onboard
the Voyager Two spacecraft.

1:07:20.801 --> 1:07:22.361
- The spacecraft has a problem.

1:07:22.361 --> 1:07:24.841
The scan platform operating mechanism

1:07:24.841 --> 1:07:26.521
is not operating properly.

1:07:26.521 --> 1:07:27.881
- [Narrator] And make
sure we understand where

1:07:27.881 --> 1:07:29.361
we're headed if the following instruments

1:07:29.361 --> 1:07:31.201
are mounted on the platform.

1:07:31.201 --> 1:07:33.801
The wide-angle camera,
the narrow-angle camera,

1:07:33.801 --> 1:07:36.881
the infrared instrument,
the ultraviolet instrument,

1:07:36.881 --> 1:07:38.441
and the photopolarimeter.

1:07:38.441 --> 1:07:41.161
- Yeah, that was the darkest,

1:07:41.161 --> 1:07:43.601
the darkest day of the whole mission.

1:07:43.601 --> 1:07:45.601
- [Narrator] There is
circumstantial evidence.

1:07:45.601 --> 1:07:47.841
- [Narrator] I came into the auditorium,

1:07:47.841 --> 1:07:51.881
and there was just gloom
on everybody's face.

1:07:51.881 --> 1:07:53.601
- You're beginning to speculate.

1:07:53.601 --> 1:07:56.521
- I quickly learned what had happened.

1:07:56.521 --> 1:07:58.921
The scan platform had frozen.

1:07:59.841 --> 1:08:01.281
- [Narrator] We were
moving our scan platform

1:08:01.281 --> 1:08:02.761
all over the sky.

1:08:02.761 --> 1:08:05.001
And we're actually going as fast

1:08:05.001 --> 1:08:07.161
as it could possibly go.

1:08:07.161 --> 1:08:09.321
- A frozen scan platform

1:08:09.321 --> 1:08:12.161
could be a fatal, crippling event.

1:08:13.041 --> 1:08:15.601
(solemn music)

1:08:19.481 --> 1:08:21.161
- The rest of the Saturn mission,

1:08:21.161 --> 1:08:23.921
and Uranus and Neptune were dead.

1:08:24.961 --> 1:08:29.161
And seeing everything that
we were planning just gone,

1:08:30.801 --> 1:08:32.441
just suddenly gone.

1:08:32.441 --> 1:08:34.121
- The problem is not with the camera,

1:08:34.121 --> 1:08:36.041
it's with the articulated platform

1:08:36.041 --> 1:08:37.881
that moves all of the instruments.

1:08:37.881 --> 1:08:39.121
Our camera is, as far as we know,

1:08:39.121 --> 1:08:40.201
are working just fine.

1:08:40.201 --> 1:08:41.801
It's just that we're
taking lots of pictures

1:08:41.801 --> 1:08:43.041
of black space.

1:08:44.121 --> 1:08:45.921
- All of the science
that we had hoped to do,

1:08:45.921 --> 1:08:48.641
and Uranus and Neptune, there
were no other spacecraft

1:08:48.641 --> 1:08:49.841
that were going to be going there.

1:08:49.841 --> 1:08:51.361
It was up to Voyager to do it,

1:08:51.361 --> 1:08:53.321
and all of a sudden it
looked as though Voyager

1:08:53.321 --> 1:08:54.841
was not going to do it.

1:08:54.841 --> 1:08:57.081
It was devastating, it was.

1:09:02.201 --> 1:09:04.041
- [Narrator] It took a
couple of days while the

1:09:04.041 --> 1:09:08.001
engineering team went to
work diagnosing the problem.

1:09:08.001 --> 1:09:10.401
- [Narrator] We are going
to command an azimuth slew

1:09:10.401 --> 1:09:12.641
and an elevation slew

1:09:12.641 --> 1:09:14.361
to the Saturn position.

1:09:14.361 --> 1:09:15.961
- It turns out the scan platform

1:09:15.961 --> 1:09:17.841
has small motors to rotate it,

1:09:17.841 --> 1:09:19.441
and we could run it at slow speed.

1:09:19.441 --> 1:09:20.881
Tick, tick, tick, tick.

1:09:20.881 --> 1:09:23.761
Fast medium speed or very fast.

1:09:23.761 --> 1:09:25.881
We were of course wanting
to look at lots of places,

1:09:25.881 --> 1:09:28.321
so we had the thing
looking lots of places,

1:09:28.321 --> 1:09:32.881
and the lubrication wasn't
adequate and it just jammed.

1:09:32.881 --> 1:09:35.761
- It was frozen sort of like a car

1:09:35.761 --> 1:09:37.801
stuck in the snow.

1:09:37.801 --> 1:09:39.681
You try to go forward
or backward little bit

1:09:39.681 --> 1:09:42.881
and keep working on it
and try to get it out,

1:09:42.881 --> 1:09:44.401
and that's what we did
with the scan platform.

1:09:44.401 --> 1:09:47.121
We would try to push it a
little bit in one direction

1:09:47.121 --> 1:09:48.561
and it would yield a little bit,

1:09:48.561 --> 1:09:50.241
and then we'd push it
in the other direction,

1:09:50.241 --> 1:09:51.921
and it would yield a little bit more,

1:09:51.921 --> 1:09:53.121
and then we kept doing that

1:09:53.121 --> 1:09:55.321
back and forth, back and forth.

1:09:55.321 --> 1:09:57.521
And finally that was enough

1:09:57.521 --> 1:10:00.681
to get the lubrication into the gears.

1:10:01.721 --> 1:10:03.361
- It was freed up

1:10:03.361 --> 1:10:04.841
and back came the spacecraft,

1:10:04.841 --> 1:10:07.161
and back came the imaging system,

1:10:07.161 --> 1:10:09.561
and there was Saturn on exit.

1:10:11.121 --> 1:10:12.161
(slow paced music)

1:10:12.161 --> 1:10:14.241
(laughter)

1:10:14.241 --> 1:10:15.041
- Yeah.

1:10:23.161 --> 1:10:25.441
- [Narrator] We were looking
at the shadow of Saturn

1:10:25.441 --> 1:10:26.561
on the rings.

1:10:26.561 --> 1:10:31.241
And it was clearly from
this wild, crazy angle.

1:10:31.241 --> 1:10:32.121
Wow.

1:10:32.121 --> 1:10:35.761
Holy cow, we're on the
other side of Saturn.

1:10:37.161 --> 1:10:38.921
♫ Us

1:10:42.881 --> 1:10:45.121
♫ And them

1:10:51.321 --> 1:10:54.921
♫ And after all we're only

1:10:56.601 --> 1:10:59.161
♫ Ordinary men

1:10:59.161 --> 1:11:01.241
- We felt like we were there.

1:11:01.241 --> 1:11:03.681
Nobody even thought about it.

1:11:05.281 --> 1:11:07.201
Voyager was part of us.

1:11:08.241 --> 1:11:09.481
We.

1:11:09.481 --> 1:11:11.241
♫ Me

1:11:15.281 --> 1:11:17.441
♫ And you

1:11:22.921 --> 1:11:24.721
- All of planetary exploration to me

1:11:24.721 --> 1:11:27.121
is a story about longing.

1:11:27.121 --> 1:11:29.561
It's a longing to know ourselves.

1:11:29.561 --> 1:11:31.321
It's a longing to understand

1:11:31.321 --> 1:11:33.921
the significance of our own existence.

1:11:33.921 --> 1:11:35.481
It's a longing to communicate,

1:11:35.481 --> 1:11:36.441
to say to the universe

1:11:36.441 --> 1:11:38.801
we're here, you know, know us.

1:11:38.801 --> 1:11:40.801
You know, where are you?

1:11:41.801 --> 1:11:44.761
♫ Forward he cried

1:11:44.761 --> 1:11:46.201
♫ From the rear and

1:11:46.201 --> 1:11:49.361
♫ The front rank died

1:11:52.521 --> 1:11:54.321
- [Narrator] How would you go about trying

1:11:54.321 --> 1:11:58.961
to communicate with a
totally alien civilization?

1:11:58.961 --> 1:12:00.201
- [Narrator] The assumption is that we

1:12:00.201 --> 1:12:02.201
share the same physical universe.

1:12:02.201 --> 1:12:04.321
That the laws of physics here on earth

1:12:04.321 --> 1:12:06.761
seem to be applicable everywhere.

1:12:06.761 --> 1:12:08.841
Science and math will be something

1:12:08.841 --> 1:12:12.601
that we can communicate
with them fairly easily.

1:12:12.601 --> 1:12:15.561
- Humans universally love music.

1:12:15.561 --> 1:12:18.401
And so the record says we like this stuff.

1:12:18.401 --> 1:12:21.761
And we sent it out as
a kind of gift for you.

1:12:21.761 --> 1:12:25.361
Beneath that there are
mathematical structure.

1:12:25.361 --> 1:12:27.961
The mathematical structure
of a straight pop song

1:12:27.961 --> 1:12:30.001
is pretty simple, it's like arithmetic.

1:12:30.001 --> 1:12:32.761
The mathematical structure of a Bach Fugue

1:12:32.761 --> 1:12:35.521
is much more complicated
and rewarding to attention.

1:12:35.521 --> 1:12:39.401
Mathematics really is
a universal language.

1:12:39.401 --> 1:12:41.361
So we did make sure that the record

1:12:41.361 --> 1:12:45.521
included music that would
reward mathematical study.

1:12:45.521 --> 1:12:48.601
(instrumental music)

1:12:54.481 --> 1:12:55.521
- I have concerns.

1:12:55.521 --> 1:12:59.121
I mean we have intelligent
life on our own planet.

1:12:59.121 --> 1:13:01.521
Dolphins and whales that we don't

1:13:01.521 --> 1:13:04.761
communicate with, we
cannot communicate with.

1:13:04.761 --> 1:13:07.001
Other than tricks for fish.

1:13:11.321 --> 1:13:13.561
It's a little conceited to think that

1:13:13.561 --> 1:13:14.801
it's gonna be like Star Trek

1:13:14.801 --> 1:13:17.281
and if we find some advance life

1:13:17.281 --> 1:13:19.121
that we'll immediately

1:13:20.081 --> 1:13:22.201
sit down for tea together or something.

1:13:22.201 --> 1:13:25.441
It's not gonna be that simple.

1:13:25.441 --> 1:13:27.321
(perky music)
(camera shudders)

1:13:27.321 --> 1:13:30.601
- So the Voyager record
has a set of pictures on it

1:13:30.601 --> 1:13:32.841
that depicts our civilization.

1:13:32.841 --> 1:13:36.201
But we only had the ability
to do about 100 pictures,

1:13:36.201 --> 1:13:38.441
that was as much data as we could send.

1:13:38.441 --> 1:13:40.481
So that was kind of hard.

1:13:40.481 --> 1:13:42.521
- It was a process of distillation.

1:13:42.521 --> 1:13:46.001
You can't describe the
Earth in 100 pictures.

1:13:46.001 --> 1:13:48.601
You can't describe the Earth
in a thousand pictures.

1:13:48.601 --> 1:13:50.521
But what art is about

1:13:50.521 --> 1:13:53.201
is taking something that's small

1:13:54.081 --> 1:13:56.081
but can represent the whole.

1:13:56.081 --> 1:13:58.601
(perky music)

1:14:07.241 --> 1:14:08.841
- We thought it was very important

1:14:08.841 --> 1:14:11.681
to put some pictures of
humans nude on the record

1:14:11.681 --> 1:14:15.601
to show just what our
anatomy was really like.

1:14:15.601 --> 1:14:19.081
NASA had been seriously criticised

1:14:19.081 --> 1:14:21.041
about the Pioneer plaque.

1:14:21.041 --> 1:14:23.681
There were actually letters
to the editors of newspapers

1:14:23.681 --> 1:14:27.281
saying that NASA was
sending smut to space.

1:14:28.641 --> 1:14:30.041
How are we going to show pictures of

1:14:30.041 --> 1:14:33.561
naked humans without it looking salacious?

1:14:33.561 --> 1:14:35.401
And the answer to that was why don't

1:14:35.401 --> 1:14:38.041
you put a pregnant woman in the picture.

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:41.441
Because pregnant women are
not considered salacious.

1:14:41.441 --> 1:14:44.121
Not appealing sexually.

1:14:44.121 --> 1:14:46.201
So that's what we did.

1:14:46.201 --> 1:14:47.881
- And I figured if this
doesn't get passed NASA

1:14:47.881 --> 1:14:49.361
nothing's getting passed NASA.

1:14:49.361 --> 1:14:51.001
And I guess the answer was nothing's

1:14:51.001 --> 1:14:54.201
getting passed NASA because
it was the only picture

1:14:54.201 --> 1:14:56.441
that they made us take out.

1:14:57.921 --> 1:15:02.241
- [Narrator] Now it's five
years of cruising out to Uranus.

1:15:02.241 --> 1:15:04.121
- Uranus will be the most remote object

1:15:04.121 --> 1:15:06.041
yet visited by a spacecraft.

1:15:06.041 --> 1:15:08.121
And it's so remote it was not even known

1:15:08.121 --> 1:15:09.521
until 200 years ago.

1:15:09.521 --> 1:15:11.041
And it's a great distance out there

1:15:11.041 --> 1:15:12.401
and if we launch directly from earth

1:15:12.401 --> 1:15:14.321
it would have taken 30 years to get there.

1:15:14.321 --> 1:15:15.881
So we're very fortunate that we can swing

1:15:15.881 --> 1:15:18.121
by Jupiter and Saturn on our way.

1:15:18.121 --> 1:15:20.481
- I can always say that as
an observational astronomer

1:15:20.481 --> 1:15:21.881
I've been trying to figure this thing out

1:15:21.881 --> 1:15:23.241
for the past 25 years

1:15:23.241 --> 1:15:26.241
and it's very frustrating in a telescope

1:15:26.241 --> 1:15:27.961
to look at that tiny little disc

1:15:27.961 --> 1:15:30.521
and try to determine anything about it.

1:15:30.521 --> 1:15:32.201
For me the next few days are gonna

1:15:32.201 --> 1:15:33.761
be very exciting.

1:15:33.761 --> 1:15:36.681
(slow paced music)

1:15:38.281 --> 1:15:39.881
(camera shudder)

1:15:39.881 --> 1:15:42.161
- Once we got beyond Saturn,

1:15:42.161 --> 1:15:45.201
essentially the engineers
threw out the rule book

1:15:45.201 --> 1:15:48.641
and said, "How are we
gonna make this work?

1:15:48.641 --> 1:15:52.041
"How are we gonna take pictures of planets

1:15:52.041 --> 1:15:54.681
"this far from the Sun?"

1:15:54.681 --> 1:15:58.081
- Voyager was the first of
a class of NASA spacecraft

1:15:58.081 --> 1:16:00.161
that could be reprogrammed.

1:16:00.161 --> 1:16:01.521
They could take what was on the computer

1:16:01.521 --> 1:16:02.641
and just wipe it away

1:16:02.641 --> 1:16:05.241
and give it a whole new set of software.

1:16:05.241 --> 1:16:07.361
They trained the spacecraft to

1:16:07.361 --> 1:16:09.561
pirouette like a ballet dancer.

1:16:09.561 --> 1:16:11.521
Basically you want to take
a picture of that thing

1:16:11.521 --> 1:16:13.201
and it's going past you really fast,

1:16:13.201 --> 1:16:16.201
so you spin the whole spacecraft

1:16:16.201 --> 1:16:18.601
and follow it like this.

1:16:18.601 --> 1:16:21.041
And so even though it was darker at Uranus

1:16:21.041 --> 1:16:22.601
and really dark at Neptune,

1:16:22.601 --> 1:16:25.361
you could leave the shutter
open without smearing,

1:16:25.361 --> 1:16:27.721
and that was just beautiful.

1:16:28.841 --> 1:16:31.081
- We had all of the rich set of goodies

1:16:31.081 --> 1:16:33.521
from Jupiter and from Saturn,

1:16:33.521 --> 1:16:35.441
but Uranus was unknown.

1:16:39.321 --> 1:16:40.961
- Our going on out to Uranus and Neptune

1:16:40.961 --> 1:16:43.161
that was the first time.

1:16:43.161 --> 1:16:44.721
We just had the one spacecraft so we

1:16:44.721 --> 1:16:46.681
were more or less just flying blind

1:16:46.681 --> 1:16:48.921
and we didn't get a second chance.

1:16:48.921 --> 1:16:50.001
(laughter)

1:16:50.001 --> 1:16:51.841
Nor will there be a second chance.

1:16:51.841 --> 1:16:53.481
And I think for quite some time

1:16:53.481 --> 1:16:55.401
it's very unlikely that

1:16:56.641 --> 1:17:00.001
we'll all be dead and gone before

1:17:00.001 --> 1:17:02.201
anyone goes back out there

1:17:02.201 --> 1:17:04.441
to Uranus and Neptune again.

1:17:04.441 --> 1:17:07.281
(whimsical music)

1:17:22.561 --> 1:17:24.241
- [Narrator] It was like taking something

1:17:24.241 --> 1:17:26.881
that was almost fictional,
almost mythological,

1:17:26.881 --> 1:17:29.881
and then seeing it as a real object.

1:17:31.161 --> 1:17:33.441
- Spacecraft flew through
that system like a bull's eye

1:17:33.441 --> 1:17:35.641
because Uranus is tilted on its side,

1:17:35.641 --> 1:17:38.961
with this beautiful aquamarine
blue methane atmosphere,

1:17:38.961 --> 1:17:39.961
and all these pictures,

1:17:39.961 --> 1:17:41.561
every single one of them is like whoa!

1:17:41.561 --> 1:17:43.721
And you could hear people just "Whoa!"

1:17:43.721 --> 1:17:45.441
And everybody would be doing something

1:17:45.441 --> 1:17:46.401
and somebody would go "Whoa!"

1:17:46.401 --> 1:17:47.601
And everybody would turn and look up.

1:17:47.601 --> 1:17:49.241
"Oh my gosh, look at that!"

1:17:49.241 --> 1:17:50.521
(beeping)

1:17:50.521 --> 1:17:51.361
There was no Internet,

1:17:51.361 --> 1:17:55.201
there was no news stream
going out to live CNN.

1:17:55.201 --> 1:17:57.801
The only way to experience that sensation

1:17:57.801 --> 1:18:00.721
of being one of only a
small group of people

1:18:00.721 --> 1:18:04.041
who saw a point of light become a world,

1:18:05.161 --> 1:18:08.041
the only way to experience
it was to be in that room.

1:18:08.041 --> 1:18:10.201
- [Narrator] Well just
about two minutes ago,

1:18:10.201 --> 1:18:11.681
Voyager Two passed through

1:18:11.681 --> 1:18:13.761
it's closest approach to Uranus.

1:18:13.761 --> 1:18:15.761
(applause)

1:18:15.761 --> 1:18:18.121
- [Narrator] The new ring is

1:18:18.961 --> 1:18:19.881
right here.

1:18:20.961 --> 1:18:22.041
Now, I don't...

1:18:22.041 --> 1:18:23.401
(laughter)

1:18:23.401 --> 1:18:25.281
You're telling me you can't see it.

1:18:25.281 --> 1:18:26.521
I can.

1:18:26.521 --> 1:18:27.561
- Dr. Soderblom,

1:18:27.561 --> 1:18:28.881
as you whizzed through your explanation,

1:18:28.881 --> 1:18:30.041
I couldn't put it all together,

1:18:30.041 --> 1:18:32.921
could you try that again?

1:18:32.921 --> 1:18:33.761
- Slower?

1:18:34.681 --> 1:18:36.241
- Slower and a few more details.

1:18:36.241 --> 1:18:39.001
- I thought that was pretty slow.

1:18:41.721 --> 1:18:43.361
- Every time we arrived at a new planet

1:18:43.361 --> 1:18:44.321
there were always surprises

1:18:44.321 --> 1:18:46.361
even though we had gotten a lot smarter.

1:18:46.361 --> 1:18:47.841
For instance, before Voyager,

1:18:47.841 --> 1:18:49.281
all the magnetic fields

1:18:49.281 --> 1:18:51.361
have the magnetic pole near

1:18:51.361 --> 1:18:53.241
the rotation axis of the planet,

1:18:53.241 --> 1:18:54.361
and that was true for Jupiter,

1:18:54.361 --> 1:18:55.841
it was true for Saturn.

1:18:55.841 --> 1:18:57.681
And then we flew by Uranus and

1:18:57.681 --> 1:19:00.561
the pole was near the equator.

1:19:00.561 --> 1:19:01.801
- There's been a lot of speculation

1:19:01.801 --> 1:19:04.041
about the magnetosphere of Uranus.

1:19:04.041 --> 1:19:04.961
Would there be one,

1:19:04.961 --> 1:19:06.681
what would it be like?

1:19:06.681 --> 1:19:08.121
And the magnetosphere of Uranus

1:19:08.121 --> 1:19:11.081
is far more weird and wonderful.

1:19:11.081 --> 1:19:13.761
We found the planet tipped on it's side,

1:19:13.761 --> 1:19:16.081
but the magnetic field is then tipped

1:19:16.081 --> 1:19:17.761
relative to the spin axis.

1:19:17.761 --> 1:19:21.241
So you have this huge contortion

1:19:21.241 --> 1:19:22.521
in the magnetic field

1:19:22.521 --> 1:19:25.401
as the planet spins around.

1:19:25.401 --> 1:19:26.921
Just bizarre.

1:19:26.921 --> 1:19:29.921
Why on earth the magnetic
field was so messed up,

1:19:29.921 --> 1:19:31.161
we had no idea.

1:19:32.641 --> 1:19:36.161
- At the time the Voyager
Two spacecraft flew by Uranus

1:19:36.161 --> 1:19:39.841
one pole of the planet
was pointing at the Sun.

1:19:39.841 --> 1:19:41.761
At that point in it's orbit,

1:19:41.761 --> 1:19:44.321
it's atmosphere shuts down.

1:19:44.321 --> 1:19:47.801
So the planet itself didn't look exciting.

1:19:50.441 --> 1:19:53.561
And part of that is Uranus itself

1:19:53.561 --> 1:19:56.001
holding it's secrets back.

1:19:56.001 --> 1:19:59.161
- That had to be, I guess, one of the,

1:20:00.601 --> 1:20:03.961
well, disappointments in that Uranus

1:20:03.961 --> 1:20:06.121
was not more photogenic than it was.

1:20:06.121 --> 1:20:08.441
It was actually pretty blah.

1:20:09.361 --> 1:20:10.201
- Poor Uranus.

1:20:10.201 --> 1:20:11.961
(laughter)

1:20:11.961 --> 1:20:13.201
Poor Uranus.

1:20:13.201 --> 1:20:16.121
(slow paced music)

1:20:21.721 --> 1:20:24.641
(fast paced music)

1:20:27.801 --> 1:20:30.161
- Uranus itself was not the character

1:20:30.161 --> 1:20:32.081
that Saturn and Jupiter were.

1:20:32.081 --> 1:20:34.561
It had very very subdued features.

1:20:34.561 --> 1:20:37.521
The big stars of the Uranus encounter

1:20:37.521 --> 1:20:38.961
were actually the moons.

1:20:38.961 --> 1:20:41.561
(upbeat music)

1:20:42.921 --> 1:20:44.081
- If you're going to go to Neptune,

1:20:44.081 --> 1:20:47.241
you still have to use
Uranus for gravity assist.

1:20:47.241 --> 1:20:50.921
The gravity assist aiming point at Uranus

1:20:50.921 --> 1:20:53.281
just happened to be pretty close

1:20:53.281 --> 1:20:55.841
to the orbit of Miranda.

1:20:55.841 --> 1:20:57.161
Now some of the science, Miranda is not

1:20:57.161 --> 1:20:59.401
the largest moon of Uranus.

1:20:59.401 --> 1:21:02.521
If Uranus has been the last stop,

1:21:02.521 --> 1:21:03.521
the scientists might have wanted

1:21:03.521 --> 1:21:05.361
to go to a larger moon,

1:21:05.361 --> 1:21:06.801
which ironically,

1:21:08.281 --> 1:21:09.401
I don't see how anything could have been

1:21:09.401 --> 1:21:11.201
any more interesting than Miranda.

1:21:11.201 --> 1:21:14.201
(suspenseful music)

1:21:15.321 --> 1:21:18.081
It looked like a jumbled-up mess.

1:21:21.281 --> 1:21:23.881
- This moon looked like it
had been ripped to pieces

1:21:23.881 --> 1:21:26.361
and then just sort of
shoved back together again.

1:21:26.361 --> 1:21:27.201
- Whoa!

1:21:27.201 --> 1:21:28.121
Come look at this.

1:21:28.121 --> 1:21:29.441
- Going up to the screen
and pointing and saying,

1:21:29.441 --> 1:21:31.241
"Look at that, look at that."

1:21:31.241 --> 1:21:34.081
- Nobody was ready for Miranda.

1:21:34.081 --> 1:21:37.921
- In parts there were
enormous cliffs and gashes

1:21:37.921 --> 1:21:40.401
in which fault blocks had dropped down.

1:21:40.401 --> 1:21:43.761
And one of them, you can
see the edge of a cliff

1:21:43.761 --> 1:21:44.681
that is so,

1:21:46.281 --> 1:21:49.081
it's gotta be 10 kilometres tall.

1:21:49.081 --> 1:21:51.641
Now the gravity on Miranda is so weak

1:21:51.641 --> 1:21:54.401
that if you jumped off
the edge of that cliff,

1:21:54.401 --> 1:21:56.721
you could read the newspaper

1:21:57.961 --> 1:21:59.321
on the way down.

1:22:00.321 --> 1:22:04.401
You probably would fall for 20 minutes.

1:22:04.401 --> 1:22:05.481
But when you hit the bottom you'd

1:22:05.481 --> 1:22:07.001
still be going 100 miles an hour.

1:22:07.001 --> 1:22:09.641
And so it probably wouldn't,

1:22:09.641 --> 1:22:12.641
it would be the last newspaper you read.

1:22:12.641 --> 1:22:15.561
(slow paced music)

1:22:21.361 --> 1:22:23.241
- One of the things
that we have to remember

1:22:23.241 --> 1:22:27.161
about Uranus is it was a
very sad time for everybody.

1:22:27.161 --> 1:22:30.201
Because we were just about to

1:22:30.201 --> 1:22:32.681
present all our results.

1:22:32.681 --> 1:22:34.121
We were all about to have to the

1:22:34.121 --> 1:22:36.961
big final finale press conference.

1:22:38.921 --> 1:22:40.761
Came back from breakfast

1:22:40.761 --> 1:22:42.601
and I went to go watch

1:22:44.001 --> 1:22:45.561
the shuttle being launched.

1:22:45.561 --> 1:22:47.721
- [Narrator] We have main engine start.

1:22:47.721 --> 1:22:48.841
Four, three,

1:22:48.841 --> 1:22:49.681
two, one.

1:22:51.241 --> 1:22:53.081
And liftoff.

1:22:53.081 --> 1:22:55.721
Liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission

1:22:55.721 --> 1:22:58.121
and it has cleared the tower.

1:22:58.121 --> 1:23:00.081
- And we thought, "Okay
great, we'll watch the shuttle

1:23:00.081 --> 1:23:02.801
"launch and then we'll go
to the press conference."

1:23:02.801 --> 1:23:05.761
But of course that was Challenger.

1:23:05.761 --> 1:23:06.641
- [Narrator] Engine throttling up.

1:23:06.641 --> 1:23:08.321
Three engine now at 104%.

1:23:08.321 --> 1:23:10.561
- [Narrator] Challenger,
go with throttle up.

1:23:10.561 --> 1:23:13.761
- [Narrator] Roger, go with throttle up.

1:23:13.761 --> 1:23:16.601
(faint explosion)

1:23:19.161 --> 1:23:21.281
(solemn music)

1:23:21.281 --> 1:23:23.441
- People were just like
astonished, this gasp like,

1:23:23.441 --> 1:23:24.521
"Oh my.

1:23:24.521 --> 1:23:25.521
"Did you see that?

1:23:25.521 --> 1:23:27.081
"Did it really blow up?"

1:23:27.081 --> 1:23:28.961
Because we had stopped in our meeting

1:23:28.961 --> 1:23:30.401
so everyone could watch it,

1:23:30.401 --> 1:23:33.761
and then there was just
silence, people were crying.

1:23:33.761 --> 1:23:35.361
(soft piano music)

1:23:35.361 --> 1:23:37.841
- [Narrator] Well, what can you say?

1:23:37.841 --> 1:23:39.201
You knew right away that

1:23:39.201 --> 1:23:42.161
a bunch of people were dead.

1:23:42.161 --> 1:23:43.601
- [Narrator] Flight Throttle, go ahead.

1:23:43.601 --> 1:23:47.081
- [Narrator] RSO reports vehicle exploded.

1:23:48.801 --> 1:23:50.241
- [Narrator] Copy.

1:23:50.241 --> 1:23:53.081
- And then of course they
showed replays and replays

1:23:53.081 --> 1:23:57.201
and replays over and over and over again.

1:23:57.201 --> 1:23:59.201
- [Narrator] We have no downlink.

1:23:59.201 --> 1:24:01.961
- [Narrator] Okay, everybody,
just stay off the telephones.

1:24:01.961 --> 1:24:03.641
Make sure you maintain all your data,

1:24:03.641 --> 1:24:05.401
start pulling it together.

1:24:05.401 --> 1:24:06.961
- The Challenger accident happened

1:24:06.961 --> 1:24:08.681
as we were receding from Uranus.

1:24:08.681 --> 1:24:11.721
I have this vivid memory
of picture after picture

1:24:11.721 --> 1:24:13.721
of the crescent Uranus coming back

1:24:13.721 --> 1:24:16.521
and the replay of the
Challenger explosion,

1:24:16.521 --> 1:24:18.921
and it was just devastating.

1:24:18.921 --> 1:24:22.401
- Today is a day for
mourning and remembering.

1:24:22.401 --> 1:24:24.001
Nancy and I are pained to the core

1:24:24.001 --> 1:24:26.401
over the tragedy of
the shuttle Challenger.

1:24:26.401 --> 1:24:27.601
We know we share this pain

1:24:27.601 --> 1:24:30.241
with all of the people of our country.

1:24:30.241 --> 1:24:32.641
This is truly a national loss.

1:24:32.641 --> 1:24:33.881
I know it's hard to understand,

1:24:33.881 --> 1:24:37.281
but sometimes painful
things like this happen.

1:24:37.281 --> 1:24:38.521
It's all part of the process

1:24:38.521 --> 1:24:41.081
of exploration and discovery.

1:24:41.081 --> 1:24:42.961
It's all part of taking a chance

1:24:42.961 --> 1:24:45.761
and expanding man's horizons.

1:24:45.761 --> 1:24:48.961
The future doesn't belong
to the faint hearted,

1:24:48.961 --> 1:24:51.081
it belongs to the brave.

1:24:51.081 --> 1:24:52.481
- [Narrator] Reports
from the flight officer

1:24:52.481 --> 1:24:55.161
indicate impact in the water.

1:24:55.161 --> 1:24:58.121
Approximately 28.64 degrees north.

1:24:58.121 --> 1:24:59.681
80.28 degrees west.

1:25:06.001 --> 1:25:08.081
- During these closest
approach time periods,

1:25:08.081 --> 1:25:11.441
we would have hundreds
of reporters come to JPL,

1:25:11.441 --> 1:25:14.601
and it was great news atmosphere.

1:25:14.601 --> 1:25:17.801
And when the Challenger exploded,

1:25:17.801 --> 1:25:19.361
everybody just left.

1:25:19.361 --> 1:25:20.921
(high pitched screeching)

1:25:20.921 --> 1:25:23.241
- [Narrator] It was
really a very sad time.

1:25:23.241 --> 1:25:26.241
Sad ending to another great mission.

1:25:29.801 --> 1:25:32.721
(slow paced music)

1:25:35.401 --> 1:25:37.121
- Those cosmic questions we hope to learn

1:25:37.121 --> 1:25:38.361
by sending our machines out,

1:25:38.361 --> 1:25:39.321
the very same questions

1:25:39.321 --> 1:25:41.561
that you and I and every
child has asked themselves.

1:25:41.561 --> 1:25:43.281
"Where do we come from, are we alone,

1:25:43.281 --> 1:25:45.801
"what's the universe made
of, how will it end?"

1:25:45.801 --> 1:25:47.001
All of these basic questions

1:25:47.001 --> 1:25:50.121
are the questions that drive science.

1:25:53.641 --> 1:25:55.001
I do cosmology, I study the beginning

1:25:55.001 --> 1:25:56.401
and end of the universe
and sometimes people say,

1:25:56.401 --> 1:25:57.641
"What's that good for?"

1:25:57.641 --> 1:25:59.241
And I always say to them,
"You don't ask what's a

1:25:59.241 --> 1:26:00.921
"Mozart symphony good for?

1:26:00.921 --> 1:26:02.761
"Or a Picasso painting."

1:26:02.761 --> 1:26:04.601
But science somehow seems in order to be

1:26:04.601 --> 1:26:06.761
useful for people it has
to produce technology.

1:26:06.761 --> 1:26:10.881
But the beautiful thing
about science is the ideas.

1:26:10.881 --> 1:26:13.561
From a child you ask your parents why.

1:26:13.561 --> 1:26:14.921
But when you grow up you finally realise

1:26:14.921 --> 1:26:17.681
that what you really mean is how.

1:26:20.001 --> 1:26:21.761
Einstein has told us that
us that space and time

1:26:21.761 --> 1:26:23.441
are tied together.

1:26:23.441 --> 1:26:26.281
Integrally, we live in a space time.

1:26:26.281 --> 1:26:28.281
If our universe came into beings

1:26:28.281 --> 1:26:31.321
and space popped into
existence, then so did time.

1:26:31.321 --> 1:26:34.241
And so time itself may not have existed

1:26:34.241 --> 1:26:35.761
literally before the big bang.

1:26:35.761 --> 1:26:37.481
So there was no before.

1:26:37.481 --> 1:26:39.561
And that seems crazy, because
if there was no before,

1:26:39.561 --> 1:26:41.201
all these ideas of cause and effect

1:26:41.201 --> 1:26:42.481
et cetera go out the window.

1:26:42.481 --> 1:26:44.881
But all it means is that
we'll have to change

1:26:44.881 --> 1:26:46.601
the way we understand things.

1:26:46.601 --> 1:26:49.521
(slow paced music)

1:26:52.121 --> 1:26:53.801
Another possibility is that our Big Bang

1:26:53.801 --> 1:26:55.561
is just one of an infinite
number of Big Bang's

1:26:55.561 --> 1:26:59.561
that are occurring in what
we now call a multiverse.

1:26:59.561 --> 1:27:01.841
It's an amazing change of view

1:27:01.841 --> 1:27:04.121
which makes us yet even
more insignificant.

1:27:04.121 --> 1:27:05.921
We were insignificant enough travelling

1:27:05.921 --> 1:27:07.561
around the Sun in the middle of nowhere

1:27:07.561 --> 1:27:10.241
around a random galaxy
amongst 100 billion galaxies,

1:27:10.241 --> 1:27:12.361
but now we know that
even the whole universe

1:27:12.361 --> 1:27:15.601
that we call home may
just be an insignificant

1:27:15.601 --> 1:27:18.481
something in the midst
of something much bigger.

1:27:18.481 --> 1:27:20.481
The history of science is to remove us

1:27:20.481 --> 1:27:24.121
ever further from the centre
of the universe if you wish.

1:27:24.121 --> 1:27:26.441
Or the centre of the action.

1:27:30.401 --> 1:27:33.201
(static)

1:27:33.201 --> 1:27:36.041
- Finally at Neptune, Voyager's begun

1:27:36.041 --> 1:27:38.161
the last of a decades worth

1:27:38.161 --> 1:27:40.401
of encounters with the outer planets.

1:27:40.401 --> 1:27:42.281
- It was another three and a half years

1:27:42.281 --> 1:27:44.081
to get out to Neptune.

1:27:44.081 --> 1:27:46.281
They had to reprogram
the spacecraft again,

1:27:46.281 --> 1:27:47.561
give it, teach it some new tricks,

1:27:47.561 --> 1:27:49.281
to work in this even darker environment,

1:27:49.281 --> 1:27:51.281
even colder environment.

1:27:52.161 --> 1:27:53.361
- [Narrator] If we take the Earth

1:27:53.361 --> 1:27:55.281
being one astronomical unit

1:27:55.281 --> 1:27:57.881
from the Sun, or AU for short.

1:27:57.881 --> 1:28:00.281
Neptune is 30 times that distance.

1:28:00.281 --> 1:28:01.441
- [Narrator] When we launched Voyager,

1:28:01.441 --> 1:28:03.201
there was no capability to get

1:28:03.201 --> 1:28:05.841
any images back from 30 AU.

1:28:05.841 --> 1:28:08.961
That capability happened all after launch.

1:28:08.961 --> 1:28:12.001
It involved reprogramming the spacecraft,

1:28:12.001 --> 1:28:14.361
taking two 34-meter antennas

1:28:14.361 --> 1:28:16.801
and adding them to a 70-meter antenna.

1:28:16.801 --> 1:28:18.721
- [Narrator] Copy, we're
ready to run that observation.

1:28:18.721 --> 1:28:20.081
- [Narrator] It meant using the entire

1:28:20.081 --> 1:28:21.881
very large array in New Mexico,

1:28:21.881 --> 1:28:25.001
27 antennas to collect
the very weak signal

1:28:25.001 --> 1:28:27.521
that we could get back from 30 AU.

1:28:27.521 --> 1:28:28.761
- The flybys past Jupiter,

1:28:28.761 --> 1:28:31.481
Saturn, and Uranus, had
sped up the spacecraft too,

1:28:31.481 --> 1:28:32.961
so it's going even faster.

1:28:32.961 --> 1:28:37.081
So enormous amounts of
pressure, and one shot.

1:28:37.081 --> 1:28:40.001
(slow paced music)

1:28:47.361 --> 1:28:48.321
- [Narrator] There it was just sitting

1:28:48.321 --> 1:28:49.881
out on the edge of our solar system

1:28:49.881 --> 1:28:51.561
waiting for somebody to come out

1:28:51.561 --> 1:28:53.201
and appreciate its beauty.

1:28:53.201 --> 1:28:54.441
Just waiting for the day

1:28:54.441 --> 1:28:58.241
that humans would get
out there, and go "Wow!"

1:29:00.001 --> 1:29:01.081
- [Narrator] Neptune was photogenic

1:29:01.081 --> 1:29:02.601
right from the beginning.

1:29:02.601 --> 1:29:04.281
- [Narrator] I had been
taking pictures of Neptune

1:29:04.281 --> 1:29:07.481
from the ground where we
couldn't see very much.

1:29:07.481 --> 1:29:10.121
You know, in my head imagining
what it might look like

1:29:10.121 --> 1:29:14.961
and seeing that turned
into reality, it's a rush.

1:29:14.961 --> 1:29:16.881
- Looking at this blue,

1:29:17.921 --> 1:29:19.921
bright blue orb.

1:29:19.921 --> 1:29:22.681
In some ways it was
evocative of the Earth,

1:29:22.681 --> 1:29:25.721
which seemed very bizarre for the last

1:29:25.721 --> 1:29:27.561
planet that we were flying by.

1:29:27.561 --> 1:29:30.481
(slow paced music)

1:29:34.281 --> 1:29:36.961
- I was a meticulous log taker

1:29:36.961 --> 1:29:39.521
and I would make little
notations in these logs

1:29:39.521 --> 1:29:41.521
and I would draw little pictures,

1:29:41.521 --> 1:29:43.761
and you could see what's
this little dark spot,

1:29:43.761 --> 1:29:46.361
bright clouds, I'm like wow!

1:29:46.361 --> 1:29:47.201
Wow!

1:29:47.201 --> 1:29:48.081
Exclamation point!

1:29:48.081 --> 1:29:50.601
And I'd draw pictures and arrows.

1:29:50.601 --> 1:29:52.361
The most surprising thing

1:29:52.361 --> 1:29:54.201
was a giant dark spot.

1:29:55.841 --> 1:29:58.161
Nobody had any idea that would be there.

1:29:58.161 --> 1:29:59.001
It's huge!

1:29:59.001 --> 1:30:01.121
It's like a hole in the planet.

1:30:01.121 --> 1:30:03.681
So we called it The Great Dark Spot

1:30:03.681 --> 1:30:06.361
because we're not very original
when it comes to names.

1:30:06.361 --> 1:30:09.681
(electric guitar music)

1:30:12.961 --> 1:30:15.201
- We had to basically make a forecast

1:30:15.201 --> 1:30:19.041
of the storms on Neptune in
order to point the cameras

1:30:19.041 --> 1:30:20.601
during the last day.

1:30:20.601 --> 1:30:22.121
And at the same time

1:30:22.121 --> 1:30:23.601
there was a hurricane

1:30:23.601 --> 1:30:26.041
off the east coast of the US,

1:30:26.041 --> 1:30:28.601
and the weather forecasters

1:30:28.601 --> 1:30:31.401
were trying to forecast that hurricane.

1:30:31.401 --> 1:30:32.241
(loud thunder)

1:30:32.241 --> 1:30:33.441
But they were trying to forecast

1:30:33.441 --> 1:30:35.321
it 12 hours in advance

1:30:35.321 --> 1:30:36.721
and they were having a lot of trouble

1:30:36.721 --> 1:30:39.081
because the storm kept changing position.

1:30:39.081 --> 1:30:41.041
And we were just calmly plotting

1:30:41.041 --> 1:30:42.561
points on graph paper

1:30:42.561 --> 1:30:44.881
and then say, "Okay, two weeks from now,

1:30:44.881 --> 1:30:49.081
"this storm is going to be
right here" and it usually was.

1:30:49.081 --> 1:30:52.441
(electric guitar music)

1:30:53.521 --> 1:30:56.041
- At Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,

1:30:56.041 --> 1:30:58.681
the goal was to do a flyby

1:30:58.681 --> 1:31:00.361
that would take the spacecraft

1:31:00.361 --> 1:31:02.561
on to the next planet.

1:31:02.561 --> 1:31:04.161
When it came to Neptune

1:31:04.161 --> 1:31:06.161
we knew that that was the last planet

1:31:06.161 --> 1:31:07.641
that we were going to fly by,

1:31:07.641 --> 1:31:09.521
and so we could take

1:31:09.521 --> 1:31:11.321
a different trajectory.

1:31:11.321 --> 1:31:13.321
This allowed us to get a really

1:31:13.321 --> 1:31:15.361
spectacular view of the rings

1:31:15.361 --> 1:31:17.121
and then look back on the system

1:31:17.121 --> 1:31:19.921
in a way that was quite beautiful.

1:31:21.161 --> 1:31:23.801
- Think about imaging
the rings of Neptune.

1:31:23.801 --> 1:31:25.241
They have reflectivity which

1:31:25.241 --> 1:31:27.281
is twice as dark as soot,

1:31:27.281 --> 1:31:29.041
and the light that's falling on them

1:31:29.041 --> 1:31:32.361
is 1,000 times fainter than on Earth.

1:31:32.361 --> 1:31:34.401
So you have one one-thousandth the light

1:31:34.401 --> 1:31:35.841
and you're trying to image something

1:31:35.841 --> 1:31:37.481
which is twice as dark as soot

1:31:37.481 --> 1:31:39.601
against a jet-black background.

1:31:39.601 --> 1:31:41.601
- More than one ring could be

1:31:41.601 --> 1:31:42.801
seen even in the raw images.

1:31:42.801 --> 1:31:44.401
The so-called ring arcs.

1:31:44.401 --> 1:31:48.081
And it seemed reasonable that
this was indeed the lost arc

1:31:48.081 --> 1:31:52.001
that our imaging team
raiders were looking for.

1:31:55.801 --> 1:31:57.281
Now you're going to turn on me, right?

1:31:57.281 --> 1:31:59.121
(laughter)

1:31:59.121 --> 1:32:01.121
- [Narrator] We knew at Neptune

1:32:01.121 --> 1:32:03.681
we wanted a close flyby of Triton,

1:32:03.681 --> 1:32:05.681
which was a huge world and a retrograde

1:32:05.681 --> 1:32:07.961
orbit around Neptune.

1:32:07.961 --> 1:32:09.561
- If you looked at them on the way in,

1:32:09.561 --> 1:32:11.241
they weren't lined up.

1:32:11.241 --> 1:32:14.281
One's up here and one's down here.

1:32:14.281 --> 1:32:15.681
And so, what are you going to do?

1:32:15.681 --> 1:32:17.601
Well, there was a way.

1:32:17.601 --> 1:32:21.321
And the way was to fly
over the north pole,

1:32:21.321 --> 1:32:23.081
very close to Neptune

1:32:23.961 --> 1:32:27.241
to bend the spacecraft
so it would go down.

1:32:27.241 --> 1:32:29.601
And then intersect Triton.

1:32:29.601 --> 1:32:30.681
- But that meant getting to

1:32:30.681 --> 1:32:32.121
within just a few thousand miles

1:32:32.121 --> 1:32:33.401
of the cloud tops.

1:32:33.401 --> 1:32:36.401
Which is like skimming the surface.

1:32:36.401 --> 1:32:37.481
And they had to hit that,

1:32:37.481 --> 1:32:39.481
you know, exactly right.

1:32:40.401 --> 1:32:41.441
- There was a lot of concern

1:32:41.441 --> 1:32:45.201
that we didn't know enough
about Neptune's atmosphere

1:32:45.201 --> 1:32:49.521
to really be sure that the
spacecraft would not tumble.

1:32:49.521 --> 1:32:51.321
It's also possible that
there were particles

1:32:51.321 --> 1:32:53.321
in these ring arcs that we might

1:32:53.321 --> 1:32:55.641
go through a cloud of shrapnel.

1:32:55.641 --> 1:32:57.721
And that would be the
end of the spacecraft

1:32:57.721 --> 1:32:58.961
if we did that.

1:32:59.961 --> 1:33:02.321
- Just a slight error in the calculations

1:33:02.321 --> 1:33:04.641
and instead of skimming
across the cloud tops,

1:33:04.641 --> 1:33:06.121
you're skimming into the clouds

1:33:06.121 --> 1:33:08.121
and the spacecraft burns up.

1:33:08.121 --> 1:33:09.521
Slight error the other way,

1:33:09.521 --> 1:33:11.641
you go a little too far,
you don't bend enough,

1:33:11.641 --> 1:33:13.521
maybe you run right into Triton and crash,

1:33:13.521 --> 1:33:15.441
and that's the end of the mission.

1:33:15.441 --> 1:33:16.281
You don't have enough time,

1:33:16.281 --> 1:33:19.001
you have to make your last best guess,

1:33:19.001 --> 1:33:21.121
hit the send button.

1:33:21.121 --> 1:33:23.521
(suspenseful music)

1:33:23.521 --> 1:33:24.961
It would have been just fascinating

1:33:24.961 --> 1:33:27.561
to be hanging on to
that spacecraft, right?

1:33:27.561 --> 1:33:28.881
Skimming over these beautiful

1:33:28.881 --> 1:33:31.361
blue cloud tops of Neptune.

1:33:31.361 --> 1:33:33.521
And then as you come
over the pole of Neptune

1:33:33.521 --> 1:33:36.761
seeing that big moon Triton rise up...

1:33:36.761 --> 1:33:39.761
(suspenseful music)

1:33:45.481 --> 1:33:47.601
- After several billion miles of journey

1:33:47.601 --> 1:33:49.201
to get us to within a few kilometres

1:33:49.201 --> 1:33:50.201
of where we needed to be,

1:33:50.201 --> 1:33:52.761
it's just absolutely remarkable.

1:33:52.761 --> 1:33:56.281
You know, threading an incredible needle.

1:33:56.281 --> 1:33:58.281
- Southern hemisphere of Triton

1:33:58.281 --> 1:34:01.521
is entirely covered with nitrogen ice.

1:34:01.521 --> 1:34:03.161
And as we flew past,

1:34:04.601 --> 1:34:05.441
here we go again.

1:34:05.441 --> 1:34:06.961
As we flew past,

1:34:06.961 --> 1:34:08.921
we were able to look down

1:34:08.921 --> 1:34:13.241
at markings on the
surface of the polar cap.

1:34:13.241 --> 1:34:14.641
We were putting together

1:34:14.641 --> 1:34:16.881
a mosaic of Triton's globe,

1:34:17.881 --> 1:34:21.601
but we couldn't get things
to line up quite right.

1:34:21.601 --> 1:34:22.761
Some of the dark streaks,

1:34:22.761 --> 1:34:25.401
two in particular would not line up.

1:34:25.401 --> 1:34:26.721
- He's like just scratching his head,

1:34:26.721 --> 1:34:29.041
like I have no idea what's going on here.

1:34:29.041 --> 1:34:31.281
This guy's one of the world's experts

1:34:31.281 --> 1:34:33.321
on anything having to do
with planets and moons,

1:34:33.321 --> 1:34:35.441
and he can't figure this out?

1:34:35.441 --> 1:34:38.161
- The only crazy idea that's left

1:34:38.161 --> 1:34:39.241
is eruptions.

1:34:41.241 --> 1:34:43.561
- I said "Well let's put
it in stereo viewer."

1:34:43.561 --> 1:34:45.321
Red and blue glasses.

1:34:47.801 --> 1:34:50.561
And the images fused into
a three-dimensional model

1:34:50.561 --> 1:34:52.801
and up popped these geysers.

1:34:52.801 --> 1:34:55.481
(faint popping)

1:34:57.001 --> 1:34:59.201
And I said "Holy moly!"

1:34:59.201 --> 1:35:01.521
And so we knew what we had.

1:35:01.521 --> 1:35:04.121
(upbeat music)

1:35:13.241 --> 1:35:14.721
- These plumes.

1:35:14.721 --> 1:35:17.801
Black geysers spewing out this stuff.

1:35:19.841 --> 1:35:21.521
- The plumes

1:35:21.521 --> 1:35:23.881
extending out of the surface

1:35:25.201 --> 1:35:27.521
for like kilometres.

1:35:27.521 --> 1:35:29.361
- We were We were seeing eruptions

1:35:29.361 --> 1:35:31.601
on a world which should have been

1:35:31.601 --> 1:35:33.361
just a frozen cinder.

1:35:35.081 --> 1:35:36.361
The last place we would have expected

1:35:36.361 --> 1:35:39.761
to see further dynamics, further eruptions

1:35:39.761 --> 1:35:42.721
was at a moon this remote
in the solar system.

1:35:42.721 --> 1:35:45.401
- This is at 37 degrees

1:35:45.401 --> 1:35:47.801
above absolute zero.

1:35:47.801 --> 1:35:50.881
So there's solar driven geysers

1:35:50.881 --> 1:35:55.041
on a satellite that's 30
astronomical units from the Sun.

1:35:58.081 --> 1:35:59.601
Who would have thought?

1:35:59.601 --> 1:36:00.681
- Just because in idea is crazy

1:36:00.681 --> 1:36:02.281
it's not necessarily wrong.

1:36:02.281 --> 1:36:03.721
(laughter)

1:36:03.721 --> 1:36:06.121
- We knew this was the last planet,

1:36:06.121 --> 1:36:08.761
Voyager would explore before it headed on

1:36:08.761 --> 1:36:11.241
for the rest of its journey.

1:36:11.241 --> 1:36:14.601
And so I think the times
together as a team,

1:36:14.601 --> 1:36:17.041
the times to look at the pictures, talk,

1:36:17.041 --> 1:36:19.521
meet together, became more precious.

1:36:19.521 --> 1:36:23.481
- I was passing by the secretary's desk

1:36:23.481 --> 1:36:25.721
and she said, "Oh,
Candy, there's a reporter

1:36:25.721 --> 1:36:28.161
"that wants to talk to you."

1:36:28.161 --> 1:36:31.241
And he said, "The countdown clock

1:36:31.241 --> 1:36:33.081
"just went from minus,

1:36:34.281 --> 1:36:36.841
"counting down, to counting up.

1:36:38.681 --> 1:36:41.361
"Voyager's now leaving Neptune."

1:36:42.481 --> 1:36:46.601
And he said "How does that make you feel?"

1:36:46.601 --> 1:36:50.161
And in that moment, I
dissolved into tears.

1:36:51.401 --> 1:36:52.801
- After the spacecraft went past,

1:36:52.801 --> 1:36:54.001
it turned around and looked back,

1:36:54.001 --> 1:36:57.121
and there's this beautiful
crescent Neptune and Triton,

1:36:57.121 --> 1:36:59.841
and people realised that's the end

1:36:59.841 --> 1:37:01.801
of the planetary part of Voyager.

1:37:01.801 --> 1:37:03.721
That's the last port of call,

1:37:03.721 --> 1:37:04.921
the last thing we'll see in our

1:37:04.921 --> 1:37:07.561
solar system is now behind us.

1:37:07.561 --> 1:37:09.601
And it went from the
Voyager planetary mission

1:37:09.601 --> 1:37:12.841
to the Voyager interstellar mission.

1:37:12.841 --> 1:37:14.521
- Of all the images that
was one of the most poignant

1:37:14.521 --> 1:37:17.761
because it was out
goodbye or farewell image.

1:37:17.761 --> 1:37:19.721
- We could have

1:37:19.721 --> 1:37:21.761
enhanced the colour a bit

1:37:21.761 --> 1:37:24.321
to make a somewhat prettier picture but,

1:37:24.321 --> 1:37:26.121
out of respect to the Voyager spacecraft

1:37:26.121 --> 1:37:29.681
we decided to show it
to you just as it is.

1:37:32.961 --> 1:37:35.201
(applause)

1:37:36.081 --> 1:37:39.881
So this was Voyager's farewell to us

1:37:39.881 --> 1:37:43.161
and that's our farewell to you.

1:37:43.161 --> 1:37:45.361
- The way I looked at it was see,

1:37:45.361 --> 1:37:47.841
we did something really great.

1:37:48.801 --> 1:37:51.481
Very, very successful mission.

1:37:51.481 --> 1:37:53.081
- A little weepy.

1:37:53.081 --> 1:37:55.161
I mean there was a lot of

1:37:56.121 --> 1:37:58.441
energy put into this mission.

1:37:58.441 --> 1:38:02.081
- [Narrator] We have ignition
and we have lift-off!

1:38:02.081 --> 1:38:05.001
(soft piano music)

1:38:10.201 --> 1:38:12.401
- Years of intense effort.

1:38:15.921 --> 1:38:19.241
It was the end of a sentimental journey.

1:38:22.761 --> 1:38:23.601
- We did it.

1:38:23.601 --> 1:38:25.081
We pulled it off.

1:38:25.081 --> 1:38:27.081
And that's important.

1:38:27.081 --> 1:38:28.561
It is.

1:38:28.561 --> 1:38:31.161
(upbeat music)

1:38:35.121 --> 1:38:37.241
- [Narrator] We had a big party at JPL,

1:38:37.241 --> 1:38:39.801
so that was a good send off for Voyager.

1:38:39.801 --> 1:38:40.961
- With a little sarcasm I'll say

1:38:40.961 --> 1:38:42.681
that JPL's the greatest moment was when

1:38:42.681 --> 1:38:45.241
Chuck Berry was on the steps of our

1:38:45.241 --> 1:38:47.681
administrative building
doing the duck walk

1:38:47.681 --> 1:38:49.441
to Johnny B. Goode.

1:38:49.441 --> 1:38:51.241
- Chuck Berry, he was present at the

1:38:51.241 --> 1:38:52.801
Neptune encounter celebration

1:38:52.801 --> 1:38:54.801
singing Johnny B. Goode.

1:38:55.801 --> 1:38:58.161
- The star of the party, Chuck Berry

1:38:58.161 --> 1:39:01.121
came out from behind the wall

1:39:01.121 --> 1:39:03.441
of building 180 and played

1:39:03.441 --> 1:39:05.921
Johnny B. Goode live.

1:39:05.921 --> 1:39:09.241
Everybody started dancing
and it was fabulous.

1:39:09.241 --> 1:39:12.321
- Ed Stone was dancing to Johnny B. Goode.

1:39:12.321 --> 1:39:13.281
It was something to see.

1:39:13.281 --> 1:39:14.961
Everybody was dancing.

1:39:14.961 --> 1:39:16.361
- [Narrator] Rockstar moment

1:39:16.361 --> 1:39:18.041
and sail on Voyager.

1:39:19.721 --> 1:39:22.001
♫ Go

1:39:22.001 --> 1:39:24.921
♫ Johnny B. Goode

1:39:24.921 --> 1:39:26.121
- And I'm gonna go get some sleep

1:39:26.121 --> 1:39:28.241
or maybe I'll do a little more dancing.

1:39:28.241 --> 1:39:29.641
Thank you very much, Lou?

1:39:29.641 --> 1:39:31.881
(cheering)

1:39:34.841 --> 1:39:37.641
- Meanwhile Voyager One is still
kind of cruising out there,

1:39:37.641 --> 1:39:39.241
getting farther and farther out,

1:39:39.241 --> 1:39:40.561
and a number of folks on the team,

1:39:40.561 --> 1:39:41.841
including Carl Sagan,

1:39:41.841 --> 1:39:43.961
had this idea that before we

1:39:43.961 --> 1:39:46.041
have to shut the cameras down,

1:39:46.041 --> 1:39:47.361
let's turn around,

1:39:47.361 --> 1:39:48.761
look back towards the Sun

1:39:48.761 --> 1:39:49.881
and let's take a picture

1:39:49.881 --> 1:39:52.241
of our solar system
unlike any that had ever

1:39:52.241 --> 1:39:53.401
been taken before.

1:39:53.401 --> 1:39:55.521
And there was actually opposition to it.

1:39:55.521 --> 1:39:56.641
- They just didn't want to do it.

1:39:56.641 --> 1:39:58.041
They couldn't get their heads around

1:39:58.041 --> 1:40:00.241
what would be the point
of taking a picture

1:40:00.241 --> 1:40:02.361
of the Earth and Jupiter and so on

1:40:02.361 --> 1:40:03.401
because they're just going to be

1:40:03.401 --> 1:40:04.761
little points of light.

1:40:04.761 --> 1:40:06.281
So Carl being Carl

1:40:07.601 --> 1:40:09.041
actually went all the way

1:40:09.041 --> 1:40:10.961
to the NASA administrator

1:40:10.961 --> 1:40:12.841
and got the NASA administrator to direct

1:40:12.841 --> 1:40:14.681
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

1:40:14.681 --> 1:40:17.241
to take this series of pictures.

1:40:17.241 --> 1:40:19.521
- Absolutely zero science in it.

1:40:19.521 --> 1:40:20.761
Absolutely none.

1:40:20.761 --> 1:40:23.681
(slow paced music)

1:40:29.561 --> 1:40:30.761
- [Narrator] People
had been taking selfies

1:40:30.761 --> 1:40:31.921
of our planet for as long as

1:40:31.921 --> 1:40:33.641
the space program's been going on.

1:40:33.641 --> 1:40:35.841
No one had ever taken one like this.

1:40:35.841 --> 1:40:38.521
And they ended up on Valentines Day 1990,

1:40:38.521 --> 1:40:41.721
taking this beautiful family portrait.

1:40:41.721 --> 1:40:43.881
(beeping)

1:40:45.081 --> 1:40:48.321
- When we did our portrait
of each of the planets,

1:40:48.321 --> 1:40:50.281
I was the first person
to look at the pictures

1:40:50.281 --> 1:40:52.161
and I knew every blemish,

1:40:52.161 --> 1:40:53.841
and so I could pretty quickly go

1:40:53.841 --> 1:40:55.281
blemish, blemish, blemish.

1:40:55.281 --> 1:40:58.081
And I thought, "Well, where's the Earth?"

1:40:58.081 --> 1:41:00.001
How could we, you know?

1:41:00.881 --> 1:41:03.721
And then I realised there was a lot of,

1:41:03.721 --> 1:41:08.121
there were a lot of streaks
of light in that image,

1:41:08.121 --> 1:41:10.161
and I realised finally

1:41:10.161 --> 1:41:11.801
that the Earth was sitting

1:41:11.801 --> 1:41:14.281
in one of those rays of light.

1:41:15.721 --> 1:41:17.241
You know, I just sat there for a while

1:41:17.241 --> 1:41:19.401
just kind of realising

1:41:19.401 --> 1:41:22.081
"Wow, that's the Earth, you know,

1:41:22.081 --> 1:41:24.481
"that's Voyager looking
back at the Earth."

1:41:24.481 --> 1:41:26.001
And then once I had sort of recovered,

1:41:26.001 --> 1:41:27.241
I started calling people.

1:41:27.241 --> 1:41:28.401
I called Brad.

1:41:28.401 --> 1:41:29.281
Brad, "We got it."

1:41:29.281 --> 1:41:31.201
Called Carl, "Carl, we got it."

1:41:31.201 --> 1:41:32.121
Called my dad.

1:41:32.121 --> 1:41:33.801
(laughter)

1:41:33.801 --> 1:41:35.761
- And so this is a
different kind of milestone

1:41:35.761 --> 1:41:37.761
than the scientific milestones we've had.

1:41:37.761 --> 1:41:39.681
One that is really symbolic.

1:41:39.681 --> 1:41:40.721
- I'm an imaging scientist,

1:41:40.721 --> 1:41:42.601
so I first realised,
oh, this didn't turn out

1:41:42.601 --> 1:41:44.441
the way we thought it
was going to turn out,

1:41:44.441 --> 1:41:47.281
and my first impulse is to take my hand

1:41:47.281 --> 1:41:49.041
and wipe away the dust,

1:41:49.041 --> 1:41:50.281
because there was some dust on it.

1:41:50.281 --> 1:41:51.921
Well, one of the pieces of dust

1:41:51.921 --> 1:41:55.721
that I wanted to wipe away was the Earth.

1:41:55.721 --> 1:41:58.521
But it didn't matter because
in the hands of Carl,

1:41:58.521 --> 1:42:01.201
he turned it into an allegory

1:42:01.201 --> 1:42:03.481
on the human condition.

1:42:03.481 --> 1:42:05.201
- And the next slide.

1:42:12.361 --> 1:42:13.921
The Earth in a sunbeam.

1:42:13.921 --> 1:42:16.521
(soft slow music)

1:42:16.521 --> 1:42:17.561
And in this colour picture

1:42:17.561 --> 1:42:21.081
you can see that it is in
fact less than a pixel,

1:42:21.081 --> 1:42:23.201
and this is where we live,

1:42:23.201 --> 1:42:25.001
on a blue dot.

1:42:25.001 --> 1:42:26.441
On that blue dot.

1:42:27.921 --> 1:42:30.681
That's where everyone you know

1:42:30.681 --> 1:42:32.001
and everyone you ever heard of

1:42:32.001 --> 1:42:34.801
and every human being who ever lived,

1:42:34.801 --> 1:42:36.641
lived out their lives.

1:42:38.561 --> 1:42:40.241
I think this perspective

1:42:40.241 --> 1:42:43.041
underscores our responsibility

1:42:43.041 --> 1:42:46.201
to preserve and cherish that blue dot,

1:42:47.161 --> 1:42:49.001
the only home we have.

1:42:50.281 --> 1:42:52.361
- My father talks about this little

1:42:52.361 --> 1:42:55.401
tiny speck in this vast cosmic night.

1:42:55.401 --> 1:42:58.161
And that we're part of something bigger.

1:42:58.161 --> 1:43:00.321
And we're also alone.

1:43:00.321 --> 1:43:01.681
There's a great thing where he says like

1:43:01.681 --> 1:43:03.241
"There's no sign that any help is gonna

1:43:03.241 --> 1:43:05.281
"come here to save us from ourselves.

1:43:05.281 --> 1:43:06.801
"It's up to us."

1:43:06.801 --> 1:43:09.561
(loud heartbeat)

1:43:14.761 --> 1:43:17.241
(funky music)

1:43:29.121 --> 1:43:31.081
- After Neptune the project continued

1:43:31.081 --> 1:43:33.841
but it continued in quite a different way.

1:43:33.841 --> 1:43:37.481
The Voyagers didn't
have anymore encounters.

1:43:37.481 --> 1:43:40.481
They were just sailing on
out into interstellar space

1:43:40.481 --> 1:43:42.481
which people didn't really understand

1:43:42.481 --> 1:43:44.641
how far that was gonna be.

1:43:47.401 --> 1:43:50.121
- At the time we were designing Voyager,

1:43:50.121 --> 1:43:54.201
interstellar space,
where the boundary was,

1:43:54.201 --> 1:43:55.881
was totally unknown.

1:43:56.721 --> 1:43:58.001
We had our eyes

1:43:59.001 --> 1:44:00.441
on the interstellar mission.

1:44:00.441 --> 1:44:02.801
Are we going to boost the spacecraft

1:44:02.801 --> 1:44:04.841
to get out of our solar system

1:44:04.841 --> 1:44:07.201
and into the galaxy?

1:44:07.201 --> 1:44:08.441
It was a shot in the dark

1:44:08.441 --> 1:44:10.801
because nobody knew how far.

1:44:13.121 --> 1:44:14.561
Uncharted waters.

1:44:15.761 --> 1:44:17.961
- [Narrator] Goldstone, Voyager race.

1:44:17.961 --> 1:44:19.841
- [Narrator] Voyager race, Goldstone.

1:44:19.841 --> 1:44:22.081
- [Narrator] Please turn
command modulation on

1:44:22.081 --> 1:44:22.921
at 1800.

1:44:24.921 --> 1:44:28.801
- [Narrator] Goldstone
copies 1800 for command.

1:44:28.801 --> 1:44:31.121
- [Narrator] That is affirmed.

1:44:31.121 --> 1:44:34.281
(inspirational music)

1:44:41.441 --> 1:44:43.521
(static)

1:44:53.001 --> 1:44:54.801
- We know the Sun has this
gravitational influence

1:44:54.801 --> 1:44:56.321
that goes way out, almost halfway

1:44:56.321 --> 1:44:57.361
to the nearest star.

1:44:57.361 --> 1:44:59.441
So in terms of gravity, the
edge of the solar system

1:44:59.441 --> 1:45:01.121
is gonna take Voyager 10s of thousands

1:45:01.121 --> 1:45:02.881
of years to get there.

1:45:02.881 --> 1:45:05.041
But, the magnetic field of the Sun

1:45:05.041 --> 1:45:06.441
can only extend so far.

1:45:06.441 --> 1:45:08.241
It's a bubble around our star.

1:45:08.241 --> 1:45:09.161
All the stars have bubbles.

1:45:09.161 --> 1:45:11.761
We can see the bubbles
run other stars out there.

1:45:11.761 --> 1:45:13.041
So we know that they have bubbles.

1:45:13.041 --> 1:45:14.721
Where's our bubble end?

1:45:14.721 --> 1:45:16.881
Where's the influence of the Sun

1:45:16.881 --> 1:45:21.601
and it's magnetic field
give way to the galaxy?

1:45:21.601 --> 1:45:23.041
- [Narrator] We kept
going and years went by

1:45:23.041 --> 1:45:24.761
and years went by and we don't

1:45:24.761 --> 1:45:27.641
detect the interstellar medium.

1:45:27.641 --> 1:45:30.561
(fast paced music)

1:45:32.841 --> 1:45:35.241
- Throughout the 1990s,

1:45:35.241 --> 1:45:37.721
still didn't find the edge of the bubble.

1:45:37.721 --> 1:45:40.201
Throughout the 2000s, still didn't find

1:45:40.201 --> 1:45:41.881
the edge of the bubble,

1:45:41.881 --> 1:45:45.721
and then finally in 2012 Voyager One,

1:45:45.721 --> 1:45:46.761
which is going the fastest,

1:45:46.761 --> 1:45:48.441
which is the farthest,

1:45:48.441 --> 1:45:50.401
started to see these funny things happen

1:45:50.401 --> 1:45:51.521
to the squiggly lines.

1:45:51.521 --> 1:45:54.641
Did the magnetic field of
the Sun change direction?

1:45:54.641 --> 1:45:58.081
Change the kinds of particles
it was trapping dramatically?

1:45:58.081 --> 1:45:59.841
And they see this crazy spike.

1:45:59.841 --> 1:46:01.681
(loud popping)

1:46:01.681 --> 1:46:02.681
Everybody goes, "Oh, is that it?"

1:46:02.681 --> 1:46:04.881
And then it goes back to normal.

1:46:04.881 --> 1:46:05.921
And then it was just literally

1:46:05.921 --> 1:46:07.521
one magical day,

1:46:07.521 --> 1:46:10.201
it was in August of 2012

1:46:10.201 --> 1:46:12.401
that everything changed.

1:46:12.401 --> 1:46:13.841
And it was like pffft,

1:46:13.841 --> 1:46:15.641
just popped out of the bubble.

1:46:15.641 --> 1:46:17.841
Voyager One has left our solar system.

1:46:17.841 --> 1:46:19.361
It's the first thing built by humans

1:46:19.361 --> 1:46:20.801
that has left our solar system

1:46:20.801 --> 1:46:23.081
and now it's in interstellar space.

1:46:23.081 --> 1:46:24.561
- [Narrator] Major historic announcement

1:46:24.561 --> 1:46:26.121
by NASA just a short time ago

1:46:26.121 --> 1:46:28.601
confirming the Voyager spacecraft,

1:46:28.601 --> 1:46:30.281
Voyager, as in the thing that launched

1:46:30.281 --> 1:46:33.201
way back in 1977 exploring the moons,

1:46:33.201 --> 1:46:34.561
exploring the planets.

1:46:34.561 --> 1:46:37.281
Well it has entered interstellar space.

1:46:37.281 --> 1:46:38.681
- [Narrator] NASA says that Voyager One

1:46:38.681 --> 1:46:41.201
has become the first manmade object

1:46:41.201 --> 1:46:43.081
to reach interstellar space.

1:46:43.081 --> 1:46:45.081
The cold dark region between stars.

1:46:45.081 --> 1:46:47.081
- [Obama] And we've
slipped the outermost grasp

1:46:47.081 --> 1:46:49.961
of our solar system with Voyager One.

1:46:49.961 --> 1:46:51.601
The first human-made object

1:46:51.601 --> 1:46:53.601
to venture into interstellar space.

1:46:53.601 --> 1:46:55.201
(applause)

1:46:55.201 --> 1:46:56.241
- It's a wonderful achievement, actually.

1:46:56.241 --> 1:46:57.481
When you think of it, it's historic,

1:46:57.481 --> 1:47:00.081
it's our first step out of our bubble

1:47:00.081 --> 1:47:02.601
which has been around all the planets

1:47:02.601 --> 1:47:04.761
and around the Earth essentially forever.

1:47:04.761 --> 1:47:07.041
And now finally some little

1:47:07.041 --> 1:47:09.441
thing that we have built
has left that bubble

1:47:09.441 --> 1:47:12.641
and is in the space between the stars.

1:47:12.641 --> 1:47:13.921
- I loved it when that happened.

1:47:13.921 --> 1:47:17.041
It was like humanity has
arrived into interstellar space

1:47:17.041 --> 1:47:19.281
and we all feel like Voyager has carried

1:47:19.281 --> 1:47:21.641
a bit of us into the galaxy.

1:47:23.481 --> 1:47:25.641
- It is the little engine that could.

1:47:25.641 --> 1:47:27.121
It's the little spacecraft that keeps on

1:47:27.121 --> 1:47:29.001
going and going and going and nobody

1:47:29.001 --> 1:47:30.721
really knows how it does it.

1:47:30.721 --> 1:47:33.081
But everybody's rooting for it.

1:47:33.081 --> 1:47:35.921
(whimsical music)

1:47:48.281 --> 1:47:51.481
(slow paced music)

1:47:51.481 --> 1:47:54.001
- There's never gonna be
another mission like it.

1:47:54.001 --> 1:47:57.601
It was the first and
last of it's own kind.

1:47:57.601 --> 1:48:00.201
- Voyager is rarely out of my thoughts.

1:48:00.201 --> 1:48:01.441
Always some little part of me

1:48:01.441 --> 1:48:03.881
is wondering where is Voyager tonight?

1:48:03.881 --> 1:48:06.121
Whenever I look up at the night stars,

1:48:06.121 --> 1:48:09.881
I look in the direction
that each of them is going.

1:48:09.881 --> 1:48:13.601
- We're the generation that
sent something out into space

1:48:13.601 --> 1:48:15.801
that's not only going to outlive us,

1:48:15.801 --> 1:48:18.801
it's going to outlive our star.

1:48:18.801 --> 1:48:20.561
Four billion years from now when

1:48:20.561 --> 1:48:23.161
our Sun turns into a red giant,

1:48:24.121 --> 1:48:26.361
Voyager is still going to be trucking

1:48:26.361 --> 1:48:29.001
out there through the stars,

1:48:29.001 --> 1:48:31.241
and the songs of our time

1:48:31.241 --> 1:48:32.241
are going to be out there.

1:48:32.241 --> 1:48:34.441
Chuck Berry is still out there.

1:48:34.441 --> 1:48:36.161
We'll still be out there.

1:48:36.161 --> 1:48:39.761
- When the Voyagers' power sources go dead

1:48:39.761 --> 1:48:43.001
and when the spacecraft
can no longer send back

1:48:43.001 --> 1:48:45.081
any useful information,

1:48:45.081 --> 1:48:48.521
that's really the point
at which the Golden Record

1:48:48.521 --> 1:48:50.881
becomes the primary function

1:48:51.881 --> 1:48:53.121
of those missions.

1:48:53.121 --> 1:48:55.321
That when everything else is turned off,

1:48:55.321 --> 1:48:57.121
those records are still floating

1:48:57.121 --> 1:48:59.721
somewhere in interstellar space,

1:48:59.721 --> 1:49:02.841
completing the last part of the mission.

1:49:02.841 --> 1:49:05.361
(opera music)

1:49:05.361 --> 1:49:08.121
♫ Go daddy go go

1:49:11.681 --> 1:49:14.401
- I think that the spacecraft
itself is the message.

1:49:14.401 --> 1:49:16.601
The technology of the spacecraft,

1:49:16.601 --> 1:49:18.921
the radio isotope power system,

1:49:18.921 --> 1:49:21.921
the communication system, the instruments,

1:49:21.921 --> 1:49:24.161
all of those things are carrying a message

1:49:24.161 --> 1:49:26.361
that says the people who built this

1:49:26.361 --> 1:49:27.801
knew what they were doing.

1:49:27.801 --> 1:49:30.321
- Is the any different or our solar system

1:49:30.321 --> 1:49:32.161
today than it was then?

1:49:32.161 --> 1:49:33.641
No.

1:49:33.641 --> 1:49:35.281
But are we different?

1:49:35.281 --> 1:49:36.161
Absolutely!

1:49:38.201 --> 1:49:41.361
The thrill of the discoveries,

1:49:41.361 --> 1:49:44.161
reaching the heliopause,

1:49:44.161 --> 1:49:46.601
completing the Grand Tour,

1:49:46.601 --> 1:49:49.881
I mean man, our child has just made it.

1:49:52.081 --> 1:49:54.601
- Voyager One and Voyager Two

1:49:54.601 --> 1:49:57.601
will be orbiting the centre
of the Milky Way Galaxy

1:49:57.601 --> 1:49:58.441
with all the stars.

1:49:58.441 --> 1:50:00.881
And every 200 and roughly 50 million years

1:50:00.881 --> 1:50:02.881
it will complete an orbit around

1:50:02.881 --> 1:50:05.601
the centre of the Milky Way Galaxy.

1:50:05.601 --> 1:50:08.841
- There's no wind,
water, rain, weathering.

1:50:08.841 --> 1:50:10.441
There's no planets that
they're going to run into,

1:50:10.441 --> 1:50:12.201
there's no asteroid belts or comets

1:50:12.201 --> 1:50:14.801
that they're gonna run into.

1:50:14.801 --> 1:50:18.001
And over thousands, millions,

1:50:18.001 --> 1:50:19.681
billions of years

1:50:19.681 --> 1:50:23.161
they're predicted to remain pretty intact.

1:50:24.281 --> 1:50:25.761
- From Voyager's standpoint,

1:50:25.761 --> 1:50:28.121
the Sun is just the
brightest star in the sky.

1:50:28.121 --> 1:50:29.241
Not by very much.

1:50:29.241 --> 1:50:31.721
Years to come it will fade into

1:50:31.721 --> 1:50:35.561
being just one of all the
other stars in the galaxy.

1:50:35.561 --> 1:50:38.521
And from time to time over the aeons

1:50:38.521 --> 1:50:40.401
a star will sort of
approach and get brighter

1:50:40.401 --> 1:50:41.561
and then it'll get dimmer again.

1:50:41.561 --> 1:50:44.481
It's like being in a lifeboat
on the Atlantic at night.

1:50:44.481 --> 1:50:46.321
Maybe you see a distant ship pass,

1:50:46.321 --> 1:50:47.881
maybe you don't.

1:50:47.881 --> 1:50:49.641
That's the future of Voyager for

1:50:49.641 --> 1:50:51.481
billions of years to come.

1:50:51.481 --> 1:50:54.401
(slow paced music)

1:50:55.561 --> 1:50:57.041
- All of the human tragedies

1:50:57.041 --> 1:50:58.961
and the worries and concerns that drive

1:50:58.961 --> 1:51:02.361
you and I and everyone
will be long forgotten.

1:51:02.361 --> 1:51:04.401
And our existence as a species

1:51:04.401 --> 1:51:06.441
and the greatest triumphs,

1:51:06.441 --> 1:51:07.721
the things that people think of

1:51:07.721 --> 1:51:09.401
are the most important
things in their life,

1:51:09.401 --> 1:51:11.281
all of that's gonna be forgotten.

1:51:11.281 --> 1:51:14.801
And the universe doesn't care about it.

1:51:14.801 --> 1:51:16.561
But it's possible that at least

1:51:16.561 --> 1:51:19.001
one thing we've created will be out there.

1:51:19.001 --> 1:51:20.921
And who knows, maybe some day

1:51:20.921 --> 1:51:23.001
with an infinite small chance

1:51:23.001 --> 1:51:25.241
another being might find it

1:51:25.241 --> 1:51:27.361
and at least know of our existence.

1:51:27.361 --> 1:51:30.761
It's highly unlikely,
but it's not impossible.

1:51:30.761 --> 1:51:33.241
And that small possibility surely

1:51:33.241 --> 1:51:34.401
gives us hope.

1:51:36.321 --> 1:51:37.841
- We will continue

1:51:39.721 --> 1:51:41.681
to get signals back from Voyager

1:51:41.681 --> 1:51:43.001
and we will continue to try and get

1:51:43.001 --> 1:51:46.041
signals back from Voyager
as long as we can.

1:51:46.041 --> 1:51:48.401
There will be a day

1:51:48.401 --> 1:51:52.281
when the antennas are listening to Voyager

1:51:52.281 --> 1:51:54.521
and we don't hear anything.

1:51:56.521 --> 1:51:58.121
And that will be the day

1:51:58.121 --> 1:52:01.561
that we stop communications with Voyager.

1:52:05.241 --> 1:52:06.521
And that will be very sad.

1:52:06.521 --> 1:52:09.601
'Cause whether it's 45 years,

1:52:09.601 --> 1:52:13.761
or 55 years, or 50 years
from when we launched it,

1:52:15.681 --> 1:52:17.601
it'll be very very sad.

1:52:19.281 --> 1:52:21.921
'Cause it will have gone silent.

1:52:22.921 --> 1:52:26.721
And we really won't have
a chance to say goodbye.

1:52:26.721 --> 1:52:29.281
(loud humming)

1:52:40.321 --> 1:52:43.441
♫ You won the race

1:52:43.441 --> 1:52:46.801
♫ We've claimed our place

1:52:46.801 --> 1:52:50.161
♫ Forever cold

1:52:50.161 --> 1:52:53.201
♫ And lost in space

1:52:53.201 --> 1:52:56.401

♫ And lost in space

1:53:07.361 --> 1:53:09.961
♫ Our mind is in a daze

1:53:09.961 --> 1:53:12.921
♫ My thoughts will start to fray

1:53:15.961 --> 1:53:19.761
♫ And lost in space

1:53:19.761 --> 1:53:22.801
♫ I feel I'm going down

1:53:22.801 --> 1:53:25.801
♫ There's no more solid ground

1:53:25.801 --> 1:53:28.601
♫ Forever cold

1:53:28.601 --> 1:53:31.601
♫ And lost in space

1:53:32.681 --> 1:53:35.481
♫ Nobody ever told me

1:53:35.481 --> 1:53:38.801
♫ I need someone to hold me

1:53:38.801 --> 1:53:41.601
♫ Forever cold

1:53:41.601 --> 1:53:45.161
♫ And lost in space

1:53:45.161 --> 1:53:48.361
♫ I hear an evil sound

1:53:48.361 --> 1:53:51.081
♫ It comes from all around

1:53:51.081 --> 1:53:54.001
♫ Forever cold

1:53:54.001 --> 1:53:57.601
♫ And lost in space

1:54:15.961 --> 1:54:19.081

1:54:19.081 --> 1:54:22.081
♫ And lost in space

1:54:35.721 --> 1:54:37.521
- If an alien was to hear my voice

1:54:37.521 --> 1:54:39.601
and I would know that he heard my voice.

1:54:39.601 --> 1:54:42.401
He or she or it heard my voice,

1:54:42.401 --> 1:54:44.361
I would cheer.

1:54:44.361 --> 1:54:47.441
I would be jumping up and down with

1:54:47.441 --> 1:54:49.001
ecstatic.

1:54:49.001 --> 1:54:49.841
- What did you say?

1:54:49.841 --> 1:54:50.641
How to--

1:54:50.641 --> 1:54:51.481
- [Narrator] Her.

1:54:51.481 --> 1:54:52.321
- Her.

1:54:52.321 --> 1:54:53.161
- [Narrator] I called her a her.

1:54:53.161 --> 1:54:54.001
- I see that.

1:54:54.001 --> 1:54:54.841
I wouldn't do that.

1:54:54.841 --> 1:54:58.681
That's popular nowadays but I personally

1:54:58.681 --> 1:55:02.521
do not like to answer
parmodify spacecraft.

1:55:02.521 --> 1:55:04.081
They don't like it.

1:55:04.081 --> 1:55:06.121
(laughter)

1:55:06.121 --> 1:55:08.321
- Okay, now I've always wanted to do this.

1:55:08.321 --> 1:55:09.481
Are you ready?

1:55:10.601 --> 1:55:11.761
23 take seven.

1:55:15.681 --> 1:55:18.601
(laughter)

1:55:18.601 --> 1:55:19.441
- Voyager.

1:55:23.481 --> 1:55:24.321
Wonderful.

1:55:25.841 --> 1:55:28.361
♫ I saw

1:55:28.361 --> 1:55:30.521
♫ The day

1:55:31.521 --> 1:55:34.481
♫ Where we all walked

1:55:34.481 --> 1:55:36.401
♫ Away

1:55:37.961 --> 1:55:39.961
♫ I saw

1:55:42.481 --> 1:55:45.161
(faint beeping)
