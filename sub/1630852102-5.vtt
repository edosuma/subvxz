05:05.179 --> 05:07.223

05:10.935 --> 05:13.730

He just wanted to keep
the focus on Ken Bianchi.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.700
Essentially, the defense strategy in this

05:25.783 --> 05:29.579
was to establish that
Kenneth Bianchi was unreliable,

05:29.662 --> 05:33.207
<i>that he acted alone, and</i>
<i>Angelo Buono had nothing to do with it.</i>

05:33.291 --> 05:35.376

05:35.460 --> 05:36.753

05:40.340 --> 05:42.133
<i>and I think his credibility is crucial.</i>

05:42.216 --> 05:45.428

05:45.511 --> 05:47.472

11:41.575 --> 11:43.536
<i>As soon as he stopped the car,</i>

11:43.619 --> 11:46.789
<i>I opened up the door,</i>
<i>started to push myself out,</i>

11:46.872 --> 11:48.541

11:48.624 --> 11:49.875

15:30.304 --> 15:32.973
We had another team of serial killers

<i>Lawrence Bittaker and Roy Norris,</i>

15:45.569 --> 15:47.112
The so-called toolbox aspect

15:47.196 --> 15:51.617
came through the use of pliers

use of icepicks, things along these lines.

15:55.245 --> 15:57.581
RENNER: <i>You name it, </i>
<i>this is what they used</i>

15:57.665 --> 16:00.125

<i>And that was where</i>
<i>they did their torturing.</i>

16:10.678 --> 16:14.348
We felt that the freeway killer
had to be highly mobile.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.266
He knew the city basically.

16:17.476 --> 16:20.104
HOLES: <i>They know this offender is</i>

16:20.187 --> 16:22.314

It's the worst of the worst

17:11.864 --> 17:15.159
because they're not just merely
sexually assaulting and killing,

17:15.242 --> 17:16.618
they want to inflict pain.

JAMI FLOYD: <i>Detectives John St. John</i>

said, "I'd like to talk to your guy

I say, "John, fine,
go ahead and talk to him."

34:52.548 --> 34:55.885
And John got a list out
of all the victims.

34:57.178 --> 34:59.180
<i>Bonin for some reason opened right up.</i>

34:59.722 --> 35:02.558
<i>He had told John, he says,</i>
<i>"I'm afraid of your partner."</i>

35:02.642 --> 35:05.103
I mean, maybe he thought I was
gonna strangle him 'cause I felt like it

35:06.729 --> 35:09.482
<i>It wasn't until an arrest was made</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:12.360
that the detectives finally admitted

35:12.443 --> 35:13.903
that all of these things were connected.

35:15.154 --> 35:16.572
<i>There was a news conference</i>

35:16.656 --> 35:18.783
<i>saying that they had made an arrest</i>

35:18.866 --> 35:22.120
<i>and they identified him</i>
<i>as a truck driver from Downey.</i>

35:22.745 --> 35:24.622
<i>And they named him Bill Bonin.</i>

35:25.248 --> 35:27.333
They didn't say how many murders
he was connected with.

35:27.416 --> 35:28.793
They kept that pretty quiet

35:28.876 --> 35:32.130
but they said that he is good
for a number of cases.

35:32.213 --> 35:35.091
BAILIFF: <i>Remain seated. Come to order.</i>
<i>The court is now in session.</i>

35:35.174 --> 35:37.135
When Bonin was first in court,

35:37.218 --> 35:39.053
they didn't charge him
with any murders yet

35:39.137 --> 35:40.805
'cause they had--
they needed blood information

35:40.888 --> 35:42.890
and other stuff
had to come in from the lab.

35:43.349 --> 35:45.852
<i>It was either on a Thursday</i>
<i>or a Friday when he was in court</i>

35:45.935 --> 35:48.437
so they, they really had
until the following Monday

35:48.896 --> 35:52.024
to either, you know,
hammer him with the charges

35:52.108 --> 35:54.110
or they're gonna-- he was gonna make bail.

35:55.361 --> 35:56.779
SOUZA: <i>From then on,</i>

35:56.863 --> 36:00.241
we were scrambling to start
preparing to file our case.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.662
All the different departments
started feeding information.

36:04.745 --> 36:06.747
Everything was going towards
the district attorney's office.

36:07.206 --> 36:09.083
<i>The van was taken directly downtown</i>

36:09.167 --> 36:11.502
<i>to our scientific investigation division.</i>

36:12.420 --> 36:15.047
They're looking inside
and it's very interesting.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.844
<i>The inner handles to</i>
<i>the doors had been removed.</i>

36:20.845 --> 36:23.556
<i>Somebody inside that van</i>
<i>wouldn't be able to get out.</i>

36:24.098 --> 36:27.602
<i>In essence, Bonin had set</i>
<i>this van up to be a deathtrap.</i>

36:29.520 --> 36:31.731
Police recovered nylon cord,

36:31.814 --> 36:33.900
a tire iron, and three knives,

36:33.983 --> 36:37.069
which painted a very disturbing
image of how Bonin

36:37.153 --> 36:39.947
would capture
and then torture his victims.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.407
SOUZA: <i>They take blood samples.</i>

36:41.490 --> 36:43.576
<i>They print the entire van.</i>

36:43.826 --> 36:45.953
<i>We didn't have DNA at the time.</i>

36:46.495 --> 36:49.415
We also had positive
identification of a match

36:49.498 --> 36:51.792
<i>between the fibers in Bonin's van</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:53.628
<i>and the fibers on some of our bodies.</i>

36:55.588 --> 36:57.423
HOLES: <i>As the investigators</i>
<i>are learning more and more</i>

36:57.506 --> 37:00.051
<i>about Bonin and his circle of friends,</i>

37:00.134 --> 37:03.095
<i>not only are they thinking</i>
<i>he's got an accomplice,</i>

37:03.179 --> 37:05.348
he may have more than one accomplice.

37:05.431 --> 37:07.391
Police talk to Bonin's friends

37:07.475 --> 37:10.728
and they head about a man
named Vernon Butts

37:10.811 --> 37:12.355
who spent a lot of time with Bonin.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.901
SOUZA: <i>Vernon Butts worked at the same</i>
<i>trucking outfit with Bonin.</i>

37:16.984 --> 37:18.569
That's where I think
he knew him from there.

37:18.653 --> 37:21.197
HOLES: <i>So an investigator</i>
<i>goes and talks to Vernon Butts</i>

37:21.280 --> 37:23.950
<i>and finds him odd and strange.</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:26.327
And so now the investigators
are wondering,

37:26.410 --> 37:27.620
is he an accomplice?

37:28.537 --> 37:29.997
MURPHY: <i>During this investigation,</i>

37:30.081 --> 37:32.792

names that keep popping up.

37:33.793 --> 37:35.878
<i>Greg Miley and James Munro.</i>

37:37.338 --> 37:40.091
Police believe they now
have three accomplices

37:40.174 --> 37:42.385
but they begin to suspect

37:42.468 --> 37:45.263
that they might actually
have a fourth: William Pugh,

37:45.346 --> 37:48.182
<i>the guy that originally</i>
<i>ratted out William Bonin.</i>

37:48.933 --> 37:52.228
William Pugh, he was definitely

37:52.311 --> 37:54.730
<i>playing like he was an innocent victim</i>

37:54.814 --> 37:57.316
but all along, he had participated.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.446
<i>Four accomplices that we know about.</i>

38:04.323 --> 38:05.992
<i>They all roll over on Bonin</i>

38:06.075 --> 38:08.244
<i>laying everything off on him, of course.</i>

38:08.786 --> 38:11.163
But we know just by comparing statements

38:11.247 --> 38:12.873
that they did participate in the murders.

38:13.582 --> 38:15.334
HOLES: <i>There are serial killers</i>

38:15.418 --> 38:17.336
<i>that of course have used one accomplice</i>

38:17.420 --> 38:21.799
<i>like the Hillside Stranglers</i>
<i>and also the Toolbox Killers.</i>

38:21.882 --> 38:24.635
But to have used multiple accomplices?

38:24.719 --> 38:26.637
That is highly unusual.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.974
<i>This is very shortsighted on Bonin's part.</i>

38:30.099 --> 38:33.936
Any time you have multiple
offenders working together,

38:34.020 --> 38:37.189
<i>that relationship is</i>
<i>going to possibly go bad.</i>

38:39.400 --> 38:41.986
MURPHY: <i>So this raises</i>
<i>a very interesting question.</i>

38:42.069 --> 38:44.613
How did William Bonin
enlist the assistance

38:44.697 --> 38:47.158
of four other men to participate
in these murders

38:47.241 --> 38:49.702

working that she was killed

40:39.603 --> 40:40.938

the Sunset Strip as prostitutes.
