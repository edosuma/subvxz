00:10.243 --> 00:12.177

00:16.783 --> 00:19.377
<i>He awoke to find himself</i>
<i>trapped in the past,</i>

<i>facing mirror images</i>
<i>that were not his own...</i>

Not tonight. We've lost 'em.
No, really. I was harassed by the police,

04:35.975 --> 04:37.909
This is a sad story.

I wasn't, uh, naked.

- Yeah, or else you'd be gone.

- <i>[ Sam ] So, let me ask you</i>

I didn't have a sheep.

<i>But I was just comin'out of those bushes,</i>
<i>right about the corner,</i>

05:04.737 --> 05:06.864
and I was callin' my dog,
when all of a sudden...

05:06.939 --> 05:09.464
this policeman comes up to me,
and he grabs me,

05:09.542 --> 05:12.204
and he arrests me,
and he hauls me in front of the judge.

For steppin' on his act.

Well, it surprised me!

How 'bout a little respect, okay?
Who the hell do you think you are?
Thank you and good night!

a round of applause...

We were dyin' out there.
You don't get this?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.895
And you-You-
Obviously you were dying,
and that is why I went up on stage.

06:03.963 --> 06:06.796
<i>[ Man ]</i>
<i>It was not the right moment.</i>
<i>You have no sense of comedic timing.</i>

06:06.866 --> 06:09.096

to you out there?
Uh-

Well-

06:12.905 --> 06:14.873
I was saving you.
Me?

06:14.941 --> 06:17.239
I don't think you should have
tried to hit that guy.

06:17.310 --> 06:20.143
I wouldn't have had to if you hadn't
have put the broad in the act.
Broad!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.738
I thought she was
pretty funny actually.
I saved your butts.

06:22.815 --> 06:24.749
Yeah, that was 'cause Davey
lost his timing.

06:24.817 --> 06:29.083
Oh, yeah? Well, what was your
excuse for being a " smuck''?
Not even close.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.089
<i>[ Sam ]</i>
<i>Look, look. Uh, guys</i>-

06:31.157 --> 06:33.853
I think that you should just
keep your feathers out of Davey's nose...

06:33.926 --> 06:36.417
and go back where
you belong-waitin' on tables.

06:40.833 --> 06:42.767
[ Snaps Fingers ]

06:45.004 --> 06:46.938
I thought you were funny.

06:47.006 --> 06:50.442
Oh, what difference
does that make? Mack hates me.

06:50.510 --> 06:53.707
Well, from the looks of things,
Mack hates everybody.

06:53.780 --> 06:57.341
I cannot go back to waiting
on tables. I just can't.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.351
Look, I-I tell you what.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.788
As soon as he calms down,
we'll all sit down and we'll talk
this whole thing through.

07:03.856 --> 07:05.790
Oh, come on. You heard him.

07:05.858 --> 07:08.554
I mean, he does not care
whether I am good or what.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.223
I mean, all he cares about
is himself. God!

07:12.298 --> 07:17.861
He is the most selfish, self-centered
egomaniac I've ever had the misfortune
to meet in my life!

07:17.937 --> 07:21.031
<i>Now ask her what she really</i>
<i>thinks of the guy.</i>

07:21.107 --> 07:24.338
- How do you really feel
about him?
- Oh, I'm crazy about him.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.310
I knew it.
You're kidding.

07:26.379 --> 07:31.373
No. I mean, you know Mack.
He can be so sweet.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.887
<i>When we first started going out,</i>
<i>he used to hold my chair...</i>

07:34.954 --> 07:39.516
and help me with my coat
and light my cigarette, and I don't even smoke.

07:39.592 --> 07:42.823
And then you offered to give me a shot,
and he turns into a futz!

07:42.895 --> 07:44.829
Close.

07:44.897 --> 07:47.832
Look, you're
a very funny lady, Frankie,

07:47.900 --> 07:51.063
and I don't think you should let Mack
or-or anybody else tell you different.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.662
You really think so?
Yeah.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.900
You can make me anytime-
Uh, laugh.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.411
Make me laugh, anytime.
So you just dry your eyes...

07:59.479 --> 08:02.175

Tables? All you idiots can go
back to waiting on tables!

No one swings on a patron of mine!

have you got?
The Cocono in the Poconos.

we're gonna open 'em up to the pits
to pull the customers in.

Then, uh, at 4:00 you can get in here
and run light and music cues with Charlie.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.523
Okay, all right. Terrific.

you look like you're starvin'.

Well, I-
No, no, no. I insist.

Tell you what. We got a bunch of new, uh,
sketches that we're gonna break in tonight.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.415
Isn't it gonna be, uh, tough to rehearse
without Mr. MacKay?

Him? Well, see, he-
Yeah, you know-You know, Mack
has never been to Las Vegas before.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.789
I-I saw him earlier. He-He's checkin' out
all these one-armed burglars.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.800
Bandits.
That too.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.302
- Do you, uh, gamble much?
- No, never touch the stuff, really.

22:52.371 --> 22:54.305
I was talkin' to Miss Washarskie.
I'm sorry.

22:54.373 --> 22:59.811
It's Turner. I changed it again.
No, I really haven't done much gambling.
Actually, I never learned how.

23:06.351 --> 23:09.684
Well, I really should-
Have dinner with me tonight.
Good, that's settled.

<i>Why do I get the feeling that I'm</i>
<i>gonna be the main course?</i>

23:37.816 --> 23:41.183
<i>Uh, don't-don't worry about him.</i>
<i>I-I'll think of something.</i>

23:41.253 --> 23:44.245
And what about Mack?
He hasn't spoken two words to us
since last night.

23:44.322 --> 23:47.587
I mean, what are we gonna do?

23:47.659 --> 23:49.991
I-I don't know.
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Well,you go on in less than seven hours.</i>

<i>Mack still dies.</i>
<i>We don't know how or when,</i>

23:52.063 --> 23:55.794
but the why has got
somethin' to do with DeGorio.
Maybe you should talk to him.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.961
<i>[ Al ]</i>
<i>Well, somebody better.</i>
<i>Maybe he's just right about me,</i>

23:59.037 --> 24:02.473
and I should just go back
to the Cocono's in the Poconos,
forget about the whole thing.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.600
I love that cute rhyme.

24:04.676 --> 24:06.974
No.
<i>Well, I'm breaking up the act.</i>

24:07.045 --> 24:10.674
No, you're not. As a matter of fact, you're-
You're making the act much better.

24:10.749 --> 24:13.309
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are. Now listen.

24:13.385 --> 24:17.947
There have been a whole lot of duos,
but there's never been a successful trio.

24:19.024 --> 24:21.356
I don't know-
We could be the first.

24:21.426 --> 24:24.657
We <i>will</i> be the first, if I can just
figure out how to make Mack understand...

24:24.729 --> 24:27.994
that the reason he can't
stand you is... because-

24:28.066 --> 24:29.897
- He's in love with you.
- he's in love with you.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.959
Love?
But with Mack,

24:32.037 --> 24:34.938
arguing is like the adult version
of pulling pigtails.

24:35.006 --> 24:37.873
<i>See, a lot of guys like Mack,</i>
<i>they kind oflike, uh</i>-

24:37.943 --> 24:41.538
Well, they think that loving
and fighting are kind of the same.

24:41.613 --> 24:44.104
Yeah? Well, it's not for me.
Me either.

24:44.182 --> 24:46.548
Look, you said
you were crazy about him.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.644
You... may have to teach him
how to love.

24:50.722 --> 24:53.714
- But he's so angry.
- Yeah, well-

24:53.792 --> 24:55.555
After six years of therapy,
he'll be fine.

24:55.627 --> 24:59.324
Look, you, uh, go back to your room, okay?
Get freshened up.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.331
I'll find Mack.
We'll have a heart-to-heart.

25:01.399 --> 25:04.800
Just make sure you're back here
for the 4:00 rehearsal.
Okay.

25:04.870 --> 25:09.330
Oh, and Davey?
Uh, don't tell Mack that I love him.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.843
Oh, no. I'll-
I'll let you do that.

25:12.911 --> 25:15.072
Okay.

25:18.850 --> 25:22.047
<i>Okay. Okay, Dr.Jung. Huh?</i>

25:22.120 --> 25:25.419
You tell me what's wrong with Mack
since you know so much all of a sudden.

25:25.490 --> 25:29.517
Okay. According to Ziggy,
uh, Mack has a pattern, see?

25:29.594 --> 25:34.224
Whenever he gets close to success,
he changes the act.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.200
Uh, it was Leonard and MacKay
in '5 5,

25:37.269 --> 25:40.534
it was Bonner and MacKay in '56,
and now it's you.

25:40.605 --> 25:43.438
<i>But, um</i>-
But, um?

25:43.508 --> 25:46.272
The bottom line is,
Mack is afraid to get close.

25:46.344 --> 25:48.369
I thought you said he loved her.
<i>Yeah. Oh,yeah.</i>

25:48.446 --> 25:51.415
He does.
It's the Woody Allen theory.

25:51.483 --> 25:55.510
Uh, " I don't like myself, so if you like me,
you must be a horrible person.''

25:55.587 --> 25:58.920
- Or maybe that's the
Groucho Marx theory.
- Am I missing something?

25:58.990 --> 26:01.686
Uh, no. Mack is a little kid.

26:01.760 --> 26:05.491
He needs- He wants attention,
but he can't handle being close,

26:05.564 --> 26:08.761
so does all these crazy things
to get people to pay attention to him.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.893
Which is why
he got into show business.
<i>Yeah.</i>

26:11.970 --> 26:16.998
Then a woman like Frankie comes along-
He wants her. She wants him.
Right, right, right. So he-

26:17.075 --> 26:21.205
He's afraid of her, so he starts
this huge fight to protect himself.
Yeah.

26:21.279 --> 26:24.407
Yeah.
Yeah, that keeps Frankie off balance
and keeps him in control.

26:24.482 --> 26:28.543
Right. And out of a relationship
that could possibly make him happy
for the rest of his life.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.748
Mmm. Go to the head... of the class.
[ Exhales ]

26:31.823 --> 26:35.759
All right. So I'm obviously here to make sure
that Mack and Frankie get together, right?

26:35.827 --> 26:40.594
Well, Ziggy says that there's a 90% chance
that if you play Cupid the act can be a success,

26:40.665 --> 26:43.930
and Mack doesn't end up as plant food,
and you leap outta here.

26:44.002 --> 26:46.163
Okay. I'm gonna go find Mack.
Okay.

<i>brief moments</i>- <i>I liked him.</i>

27:06.091 --> 27:09.993

Yeah. Anybody who doesn't
stab me in the back.

Why don't you just admit it,
all right? You love her.

27:53.838 --> 27:58.104
Take a powder.
You love her
and you're afraid of her.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.440
Why the hell would I
be afraid of a broad?

28:00.512 --> 28:04.915
Because she's beautiful, she's intelligent,
and she's not afraid to stand up to you,

28:04.983 --> 28:06.917
even though you act
like an ogre sometimes.

28:06.985 --> 28:10.477
Just because she's got you
wearin' sheep for glasses
doesn't make her tough or talented.

28:10.555 --> 28:12.489
Or beautiful.
So she looks good.

28:12.557 --> 28:14.821

You're crazy about her, right?
You're nuts.

<i>we always fight every time we're together</i>
<i>for more than five minutes?</i>

28:20.965 --> 28:25.299
Well, as far as I can tell, it's because
that's the only way you know how to relate
to a woman you're attracted to.

28:29.340 --> 28:33.299
Yeah, well- She-You-
Yeah?

28:33.378 --> 28:35.938
Why the hell'd you have to go
and kiss her?
Actually, she kissed me.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.915
- Why'd she have to kiss you?
- Because she was trying
to get your attention.

28:38.983 --> 28:42.419
- Oh, she got my attention.
Now everything's ruined.
- Nothing is ruined.

28:42.487 --> 28:45.718
Look, Frankie is the kind of a person-
<i>Mack</i>- <i>Look, Mack,</i>

28:45.790 --> 28:47.724
she knows how you feel about her.

28:47.792 --> 28:50.556
What she doesn't get
is why you treat her like she's-
<i>Like what?</i>

28:50.628 --> 28:54.655
Like I'm smart? What happens if
she finds out I'm crazy about her, huh?

28:54.733 --> 28:58.100
Then she-she'll go out with me, and then-
Then we're really gonna like each other,

28:58.169 --> 29:00.364
and then we're gonna wanna
see each other all the time,

29:00.438 --> 29:02.406
and then maybe we're gonna
end up gettin' married,

29:02.474 --> 29:04.567
<i>and having kids, and then</i>-

29:04.642 --> 29:08.942
And then we'll buy a house.
That's when the trouble really starts, too,
'cause there'll be fights over the bills,

29:09.013 --> 29:12.005
then the anger and the hatred,
and then, bam, ends up in divorce.

29:12.083 --> 29:15.109

to each other ever again, and the kids-
