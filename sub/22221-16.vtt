WEBVTT

00:14.765 --> 00:16.346
Anything?

00:16.434 --> 00:17.264
Nothing.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.636
Thanks.

00:18.728 --> 00:20.593
There's no sign of her on
any of Moya's sensors.

00:20.688 --> 00:23.270
Course, we can't see more than
300 metras in this stuff.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.643
It's thicker than pea soup.

00:25.735 --> 00:30.855
Pilot:
Crichton, Moya's never traveled
in a stellar mist as compressed as this.

00:30.948 --> 00:33.439
I'm having trouble accelerating
and navigating.

00:33.534 --> 00:38.278
Perhaps Aeryn's experiencing
similar difficulties out there
in the Transport Pod.

00:38.372 --> 00:41.079
D'Argo:
Let's hope that's all it is,
Pilot.

00:42.501 --> 00:44.753
Stark?

00:44.837 --> 00:46.668
Stark, is that you?

00:46.756 --> 00:48.587
I never thought we'd
see you again.

00:48.674 --> 00:50.460
l was meditating.
When did you come aboard?

00:50.551 --> 00:52.132
Almost two solar days ago.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.211
I finally returned the
Transport Pod you lent me

00:54.305 --> 00:57.047
after we escaped from the
Gammak Base.

00:57.141 --> 00:58.756
I'm glad you woke.

00:58.851 --> 01:01.183
I must talk to you privately.
l have something important
to tell you.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.350
Rygel:
Hmm...

01:02.438 --> 01:04.349
What are you doing out
here, Zhaan?

01:04.440 --> 01:06.647
I thought you were locked in
your chamber, meditating.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.943
l was, but I woke early from
my time with the goddess.

01:12.907 --> 01:16.115
Aeryn went out into that and we
haven't heard from her since.

01:16.202 --> 01:19.444
Perhaps you sensed the danger
and that's what woke you.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.869
How Iong's she been gone?

01:20.957 --> 01:23.243
One solar day.

01:23.334 --> 01:26.622
I thought we'd hide in this
fog or whatever it is from
the Peacekeepers.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.875
Aeryn went on long-range recon
and she hasn't come back yet.

01:29.966 --> 01:31.547
No signal from her?

01:31.634 --> 01:32.714
Nothing.

01:32.802 --> 01:33.757
(communications beep)

01:33.844 --> 01:35.550
Aeryn:
Moya, is that you?

01:35.638 --> 01:36.718
Aeryn!
-Aeryn?

01:36.806 --> 01:38.296
Where the hezmana have
you been?

01:38.391 --> 01:41.133
D'Argo, I'll come on board now,
if that's all right.

01:41.227 --> 01:43.934
Yeah, we've been looking
for you.

01:44.021 --> 01:46.398
Aeryn? Aeryn?

01:46.482 --> 01:48.222
Pilot, I've lost the
transmission.

01:48.317 --> 01:53.186
l'm locked on her position but
some kind of opening is
forming in the mist.

01:53.281 --> 01:56.614
I can see a planet
below us now.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.626
Rygel:
What did Aeryn do to it?

02:13.718 --> 02:15.083
Chiana:
Frell.

02:15.177 --> 02:18.214
Rygel:
Looks like she's been in
some kind of battle.

02:18.306 --> 02:19.842
Chiana:
I told you.

02:19.932 --> 02:23.015
I told you she shouldn't have
gone out in the mist.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.638
D'Argo:
Why isn't she coming out?

02:28.733 --> 02:30.098
D'Argo...

02:40.202 --> 02:42.454
Whoa. What the hell?

02:43.456 --> 02:45.287
This is Zaccum leaf.

02:45.374 --> 02:47.080
Yeah, so?

02:47.168 --> 02:51.127
I gave Aeryn a plant before...
before I started my meditation.

02:51.213 --> 02:53.795
She said she was suffering
from head pains.

02:53.883 --> 02:58.126
Uh, chewing Zaccum leaf
provides a potent
neuralgesic effect.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.132
You don't think maybe this is
overkill for a headache?

03:01.223 --> 03:02.429
Well, no.

03:02.516 --> 03:05.303
No, the plant I gave her was
this tiny.

03:07.480 --> 03:09.471
Blue, over here.

03:12.735 --> 03:14.225
Hey.
(gasps )

03:17.239 --> 03:18.695
John.

03:18.783 --> 03:22.071
John, you have to get out of
here. You have to get out now.

03:28.292 --> 03:30.203
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:30.294 --> 03:33.707
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:33.798 --> 03:36.460
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:36.550 --> 03:40.134
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:40.221 --> 03:40.960
Help me.

03:41.055 --> 03:42.295
Listen, please.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.221
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:44.308 --> 03:48.597
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.064
I'm doing everything I can.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.981
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:12.628 --> 04:15.210
How long... how long have
I been here?

04:15.297 --> 04:16.332
Not long, maybe an em.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.960
An am?
-Yes.

04:18.050 --> 04:20.507
The mist. The opening. It goes.
I have to go back to the planet.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.300
My granddaughter's
waiting for me...
-Aeryn, now just sit back down.

04:22.388 --> 04:25.880
Ennixx can't survive without
my Transport Pod.
-Aeryn, shh.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.511
There's no other way
off the planet.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.512
No, I... no!

04:29.603 --> 04:33.937
I only came back to warn you to
get out of the mist as soon as
possible, while you still can.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.275
Aeryn, Aeryn...
-No.

04:35.359 --> 04:39.523
Stop it, stop it. You cannot
have a family. A granddaughter.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.604
You've only been gone
for one solar day.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.529
One day?

04:42.616 --> 04:44.197
Yes.
-Hmm...

04:44.285 --> 04:48.073
Look, you're wearing the
locket, the locket that
Chiana gave you.

04:48.164 --> 04:50.826
The one that says, "sorry I
smashed your Prowler."

04:50.916 --> 04:53.328
The one she stole from the last
Commerce Planet we were on.

04:53.419 --> 04:54.875
She stole it?

04:54.962 --> 04:57.123
Yes.
-She told me she bought it.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.000
Well, that's Chi.

04:59.091 --> 05:03.926
Look, if I've only been gone
one solar day then why
am I so old?

05:04.013 --> 05:07.926
Why-why... why everything I've
lived, my memories,
everything...

05:08.017 --> 05:09.507
Aeryn, we don't know.

05:09.602 --> 05:12.218
We're trying to find that out.

05:12.313 --> 05:16.352
Maybe... maybe your mind
created the memories

05:16.442 --> 05:19.354
to compensate for your
body getting old.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.986
Look at you.

05:25.075 --> 05:29.239
I'd forgotten how beautiful
you were.

05:30.748 --> 05:33.285
You're so young.

05:36.378 --> 05:38.460
I'd also forgotten how
wrong you could be.

05:38.547 --> 05:42.586
If I've only been away for one
solar day how did this locket
here get so old?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.212
Aeryn, it's an antique locket.

05:44.303 --> 05:46.134
I don't care what any
of you say.

05:46.222 --> 05:49.089
l have lived for 165 cycles.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.640
l have had three sons
and watched them die

05:51.727 --> 05:53.263
and l have a granddaughter...

05:53.354 --> 05:55.470
Aeryn, stop.
-who will die if I don't
get to her.

05:55.564 --> 05:56.428
Aeryn, Aeryn.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.855
May |?
-Please.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.227
Stop, stop it.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.274
Stop it, stop it.
-No... please.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.192
No, no.

06:02.279 --> 06:05.066
Get your hands away from me!

06:05.157 --> 06:07.239
(sobbing)

06:07.326 --> 06:08.281
Stark:
There.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.360
(Aeryn sobbing )

06:10.454 --> 06:12.536
Take my thoughts.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.791
There.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.208
Can you feel it?

06:18.295 --> 06:19.751
Mm-hmm.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.379
Shh.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.334
Thank you. Zhaan.

06:30.391 --> 06:33.098
Do you have any idea what's
happened to her?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.686
Not as yet.

06:34.770 --> 06:38.308
I know it is Aeryn. Same DNA,
same blood composition,
same scars.

06:38.399 --> 06:42.483
By my best calculation,
she has aged 160 cycles.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.356
In one day?

06:44.446 --> 06:48.234
I've heard of rapid aging,
but nothing this fast.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.190
Is it reversible?

06:50.661 --> 06:52.447
It's unlikely.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.195
Crichton:
Pilot.

06:55.291 --> 06:56.121
Yes?

06:56.208 --> 06:57.448
Have you got anything yet?

06:57.543 --> 06:59.829
I've been analyzing the
stellar mist.

06:59.920 --> 07:06.257
It seems to be contracting
more, but Moya's sensors don't
find any toxins in it

07:06.343 --> 07:09.301
that might have caused Aeryn
to age like this.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.424
Have you analyzed the planet?
-Yes.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.973
lts atmosphere is acidic and
barely life-sustainable.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.267
Could Aeryn have survived
there for 160 cycles?

07:17.354 --> 07:20.767
No. She wouldn't have
survived one.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.441
Would you look at this
frelling place?

07:28.532 --> 07:29.942
Fascinating.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.570
What are we doing here?

07:31.660 --> 07:33.901
We're just seeing if Aeryn
came back with anything.

07:33.996 --> 07:37.238
But why? She's only been
gone a solar day.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.915
You don't believe that
other yotz, do you?

07:40.002 --> 07:43.586
No, but she still might have
come back with something
interesting.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.208
Are you going to steal it?

07:45.299 --> 07:46.163
Of course not.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.341
( laughs ):
You're worse than me.

07:49.428 --> 07:51.544
I like that.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.675
What are you doing in here?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.256
Nothing.

07:55.351 --> 07:57.057
We're looking for clues,

07:57.144 --> 08:01.638
to see if we can find out how
this terrible, terrible thing
happened to Aeryn.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.106
Chiana.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.309
Yeah?

08:08.781 --> 08:11.898
There's no dignity in what
you are doing.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.983
Zhaan would like someone
to look after Aeryn.

08:14.078 --> 08:15.284
Would you do that, please?

08:15.371 --> 08:18.158
Well, you know Aeryn.
Why don't you watch her?

08:18.248 --> 08:19.237
Chiana...

08:19.333 --> 08:20.948
Oh, frell!

08:21.043 --> 08:22.499
I don't see why it's always
gotta be me.

08:22.586 --> 08:24.622
I mean, why do you always
get the girls...

08:24.713 --> 08:26.954
Just do it!

08:28.342 --> 08:30.378
She may be dying.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.352
( coughing )
-Hey,

08:50.447 --> 08:52.938
ldidn't mean to wake you.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.319
Hi, Chiana.

08:55.411 --> 08:57.823
(coughs)
Would you help me sit up?

08:58.455 --> 08:59.240
Sure.

08:59.331 --> 09:00.992
(coughing)

09:02.876 --> 09:04.662
Is that okay?

09:04.753 --> 09:06.084
Mm-hmm.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.207
Hey.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.334
There's some water over there.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.171
(gasps )

09:14.263 --> 09:16.254
I'm sorry. Don't make
a sound, Chiana.

09:16.348 --> 09:17.588
No, no, no. Shh...

09:17.683 --> 09:20.516
I'm sorry, Chiana.
That's it, that's it.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.138
I'm sorry.

09:22.229 --> 09:25.221
It's just I don't have much
time and neither do you.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.771
Shh.

09:27.359 --> 09:28.599
Aeryn.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.524
What happened to you?

09:33.240 --> 09:35.982
I lived, Pilot.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.159
If you don't believe me, you
still must convince the others

09:39.246 --> 09:41.032
to stay out of the mist.

09:43.250 --> 09:46.458
I'm glad I got a chance to see
you one last time, my friend.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.001
What do you mean?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.329
I'll see you again.

09:50.424 --> 09:52.289
No, you won't.

09:54.303 --> 09:55.964
Good-bye.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.189
Pilot, you let her leave?

10:09.276 --> 10:11.562
She asked me not to alert you.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.939
You're all free to come and go.

10:14.031 --> 10:16.272
Are you certain this mist
is harmless?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.152
It seems to be, yes.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.235
And if I go down to the planet,
I'm not going to age 200
cycles, right?

10:21.330 --> 10:23.446
Moya has not sensed anything
on the planet

10:23.540 --> 10:27.374
to cause the accelerated aging
we observed in Aeryn.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.793
John, we do not know what
made Aeryn grow old.

10:29.880 --> 10:31.711
She will die if I don't go.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.006
I'm going to go get her,
pick her up, bring her back.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.674
I'll be on the surface
30 microts, max.

10:36.762 --> 10:40.129
Worst case scenario,
I age a couple years.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.234
Aeryn!

11:00.118 --> 11:02.029
Aeryn!

11:05.749 --> 11:07.330
Aeryn!

11:08.335 --> 11:10.371
I've come to take you
back to Moya!

11:10.462 --> 11:13.044
Go back before it's too late.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.089
I'm not leaving without you.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.632
Aeryn, look around you.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.756
Is this where you lived for
the last 160 cycles?

11:20.848 --> 11:23.339
You could not have lived here.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.139
ldidn't live here.

11:25.227 --> 11:28.185
I lived on another planet.

11:28.272 --> 11:29.853
Another place.

11:29.940 --> 11:32.431
Aeryn, there's nobody here.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.107
No one. There's nothing.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.651
You don't know what you're
talking about.

11:36.738 --> 11:39.320
Now, please, just go.

11:39.408 --> 11:42.241
Aeryn, no.
Come back with me to Moya.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.316
Oh, stop it. Don't.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.243
Aeryn, whoa.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.912
Put the rifle down, now.

11:52.337 --> 11:56.296
You touch my grandmother again
and I will kill you.

12:00.137 --> 12:02.378
Wait a minute, you're
Aeryn's granddaughter?

12:02.472 --> 12:04.383
Of course.

12:04.474 --> 12:05.850
Who the frell are you?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.845
l'm John Crichton.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.143
You're Crichton?

12:11.440 --> 12:12.304
Yeah.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.559
Huh.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.902
She wasn't making it all up.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.231
You're real.

12:21.450 --> 12:24.942
All her life Grandmother's
talked about you.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.369
About a... a ship.

12:28.248 --> 12:29.658
Moya.

12:29.750 --> 12:31.536
Yeah.

12:31.627 --> 12:37.714
Everyone, my father, her own
son thought she was crazy.

12:37.799 --> 12:42.884
She kept returning to this
Bulla forsaken hellhole
every cycle,

12:42.971 --> 12:45.348
checking to see if you'd come
back.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.549
She's only been gone for
one solar day.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.101
A day?

12:51.188 --> 12:54.351
I'm 24 cycles old.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.272
l'm her granddaughter.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.227
Well, I saw her yesterday.

13:00.155 --> 13:01.144
(Aeryn coughs)

13:01.239 --> 13:02.274
It's all right, Nana.

13:02.366 --> 13:03.276
No.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.823
I'm here.

13:05.535 --> 13:07.947
John? Go. Leave.

13:08.038 --> 13:09.574
No, I came to take you back.

13:09.665 --> 13:12.998
But the opening only lasts for
four arns. It goes away.

13:13.085 --> 13:14.450
You have to go now.

13:14.544 --> 13:15.875
I'm not gonna leave you!

13:15.963 --> 13:17.499
I'm trying to save you.

13:17.589 --> 13:21.298
If you don't go, you'll get
trapped for 55 cycles,
trapped like I was.

13:21.385 --> 13:23.341
Aeryn, what the hell
is going on?

13:23.428 --> 13:25.885
Crichton, go back to Moya.

13:25.973 --> 13:30.262
If you want to, come back
in eight arns when the
opening reappears.

13:30.352 --> 13:35.346
Come back down and you will
find me then, but you must go
now, or you will be trapped.

13:37.401 --> 13:39.141
Eight arns!

13:39.236 --> 13:40.772
Be here!

13:42.447 --> 13:44.028
How's your head?

13:44.116 --> 13:46.573
Like I've been kicked
by a sistik.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.239
Why did Aeryn spike me?

13:50.956 --> 13:53.368
Chiana...

13:53.458 --> 13:57.827
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of Rygel on the
Transport Pod, but...

13:57.921 --> 13:59.331
You could never embarrass me.

13:59.423 --> 14:01.288
Maybe not.

14:01.383 --> 14:04.295
But you're one of us now.

14:04.386 --> 14:07.048
There's no need for you
to act like you're not.

14:07.139 --> 14:10.347
D'Argo, | always do what
I want, okay?

14:10.434 --> 14:12.299
I don't know why.
It's just the way I am.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.383
I understand that, but...

14:13.478 --> 14:16.140
Yeah, but you're not going
to change me.

14:16.231 --> 14:19.394
I'm only just beginning
to realize that.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.601
You're pretty straight, huh?

14:23.447 --> 14:25.529
Yes, lam.

14:27.159 --> 14:29.150
We're not going to make it...

14:30.162 --> 14:31.698
are we?

14:33.331 --> 14:37.290
D'Argo, you'd better get up
here. John's on his way back.

14:48.513 --> 14:51.346
Aeryn was telling the truth,
or part of it.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.095
She had some kind of
life down there.

14:54.186 --> 14:56.051
I met her granddaughter.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.135
Granddaughter?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.891
Yeah. She said that they
had to stay.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.849
She had to get back through the
opening in the mist before it...

15:01.943 --> 15:03.353
Whoa!

15:03.445 --> 15:05.436
Man, you guys feel
that up there?

15:05.530 --> 15:07.816
Pilot:
Crichton, Moya's
sensors indicate

15:07.908 --> 15:10.650
that the opening in the mist
seems to be closing.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.282
Estimated time to the hole,
15 microts.

15:14.372 --> 15:16.533
Man, holding this thing
together is a bitch.

15:16.625 --> 15:18.081
John, you're breaking up.

15:18.168 --> 15:19.408
(transmission static)

15:19.503 --> 15:23.121
Crichton, the planet is
disappearing from
Moya's sensors.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.625
Pilot, what's happening?

15:24.716 --> 15:28.129
I don't think the Transport Pod
will be able to survive entry.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.336
John, you have to break entry.
Break entry now.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.386
No, it's okay. I can hold
this thing together.

15:32.474 --> 15:33.884
John.

15:35.227 --> 15:37.013
John, can you hear me?

15:37.604 --> 15:39.140
Pilot, what's happening?

15:39.231 --> 15:40.346
Pilot!

15:40.440 --> 15:43.182
I can make it, I can make it,
I can make it.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.232
Entering the mist...

15:45.695 --> 15:47.151
now.

15:52.828 --> 15:54.443
Pilot?

15:56.832 --> 15:58.197
Pilot?

16:00.210 --> 16:01.700
D'Argo?

16:14.891 --> 16:17.428
Are you in prayer for Crichton?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.890
Yes.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.642
And Aeryn.

16:35.954 --> 16:38.696
Zhaan...

16:38.790 --> 16:42.829
I've thought of something we
might try to attempt to discover
what's happened to them.

16:43.378 --> 16:44.709
Tell me.

16:44.796 --> 16:48.914
An Ancient named Galik
theorized about what he
called Center Halos.

16:49.009 --> 16:53.628
He believed that scattered
throughout the universe were
mists where all dimensions met,

16:53.722 --> 16:56.304
and where time ceased to exist.

16:56.391 --> 17:01.181
What? Do you think that Moya
is caught in one of these
Center Halos?

17:01.271 --> 17:03.478
I thought...

17:03.565 --> 17:05.851
if you and ljoined spirits...

17:05.942 --> 17:07.273
Joined with you?

17:08.653 --> 17:10.484
What would that do?

17:10.572 --> 17:15.817
I've been told that Delvians,
during a mind link, can sense
the time continuum.

17:15.911 --> 17:20.154
Yes, that is what we strive
for, but... but few have
achieved it.

17:20.248 --> 17:23.411
I thought maybe, together,
we could catch a glimpse

17:23.501 --> 17:26.368
and see if there's a void in
the time continuum around Moya,

17:26.463 --> 17:29.296
see if no time exists
in the mist.

17:29.382 --> 17:33.591
But, if I join spirits with you
your mind might overpower mine.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.928
It is possible.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.350
Like so.

17:46.441 --> 17:48.181
I will lead you.

17:56.910 --> 17:59.242
(energy field crackles )

18:33.697 --> 18:34.686
Pilot:
Zhaan!

18:34.781 --> 18:36.487
What just happened?

18:36.574 --> 18:40.863
Moya's readings just went all
over the scale and then
everything froze.

18:40.954 --> 18:43.320
I couldn't move.
Did you feel it?

18:43.415 --> 18:46.202
Yes, Pilot. We felt it.

18:56.303 --> 18:57.588
What happened to him, Nana?

18:57.679 --> 18:59.294
Oh, Crichton.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.755
He was happy for a few cycles
there, too.

19:01.850 --> 19:06.219
Something must have reminded
him, thank you, of his past.

19:06.313 --> 19:09.225
I still think about it,
sometimes. Moya.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.102
You've never been as sad as him.

19:11.192 --> 19:13.319
Well, perhaps I hide it better.

19:15.613 --> 19:17.569
Will he ever be over it?

19:18.450 --> 19:20.736
I've done all I can.

19:20.827 --> 19:24.445
We took him from the barren
planet, showed him our
favored world.

19:24.539 --> 19:25.995
I know, you've tried.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.744
We've all tried, but Crichton
was always stubborn.

19:30.545 --> 19:34.914
Why are those from the Outside
always so unhappy?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.248
Because we weren't born here.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.130
This is your home, not ours.

19:39.220 --> 19:43.088
Give Crichton a few more
cycles. He'll come around.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.014
You can rack off.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.353
I'm gonna to do what I wanna do.

19:47.437 --> 19:50.429
No, Crichton, no.

19:50.523 --> 19:54.311
I need the wormhole knowledge
that you have locked
in your brain.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.108
That's great, Scorpy.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.606
You ain't never gonna get that.

19:57.697 --> 20:01.155
I'm dying. I'm dying right
here on this planet.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.365
Still talking to those visions?
-Loser.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.037
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

20:08.124 --> 20:10.206
Yeah, he's bitching again.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.584
Oh, he's gone.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.041
Bastard.

20:17.133 --> 20:19.340
I wonder if he's still
looking for me.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.760
Oh, well.

20:23.807 --> 20:25.297
Stark has developed a theory.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.974
He believes it's possible that
Aeryn was telling the truth.

20:28.061 --> 20:31.804
She has, in fact, lived
for 160 cycles.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.684
How?
-Ah, yotz.

20:33.775 --> 20:36.141
Have you been drinking
fellip juice?

20:36.236 --> 20:39.228
Now, when Zhaan and I
joined an em ago,

20:39.322 --> 20:42.359
did any of you experience
anything unusual?

20:42.450 --> 20:43.360
Oh Yeah.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.530
That was you guys?

20:46.621 --> 20:48.907
And Rygel, did you experience
anything?

20:48.998 --> 20:51.159
My throne sled stopped.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.412
l froze in midair for a microt.

20:53.503 --> 20:55.209
And you were still conscious?

20:55.296 --> 20:58.333
Absolutely.

20:58.425 --> 21:02.259
Stark believes that Moya is
trapped in what is known
as a Center Halo,

21:02.345 --> 21:04.961
where time does not
exist at all.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.547
We believe that when we
joined for a moment,

21:07.642 --> 21:10.600
we all experienced this absence
of time in the mist.

21:10.687 --> 21:16.353
You see, it's possible that
Aeryn aged normally down there
on the planet.

21:16.443 --> 21:17.432
So it's us?

21:18.486 --> 21:20.317
It's us who are not
growing old.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.360
Yes.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.029
I don't believe it.

21:23.116 --> 21:24.856
You've got to be frelling
with me.

21:24.951 --> 21:29.365
So this means everyone we know,
Crais, Scorpius, my son,

21:29.456 --> 21:31.242
they're all old now?

21:31.332 --> 21:36.292
Yes. It is believed that
nothing ages in a Halo, and
eventually it hardens.

21:36.379 --> 21:39.621
And everything inside it is
trapped without time, forever.

21:39.716 --> 21:42.173
Pilot says the mist is
hardening now.

21:43.386 --> 21:45.172
Well then, let's go.
Let's get out of here!

21:45.263 --> 21:48.426
Pilot, how long until the
planet is due to reappear?

21:48.516 --> 21:51.223
If what Aeryn outlined
still holds,

21:51.311 --> 21:56.226
the opening will reform in the
mist in less than one am.

21:59.277 --> 22:05.273
(Crichton singing )
I'll go no more a-rovin'
with you fair maid.

22:05.366 --> 22:09.234
A-rovin', a-rovin',

22:09.329 --> 22:12.913
since rovin's been my ru-i-in

22:12.999 --> 22:17.914
I'll go no more a-rovin'

22:18.004 --> 22:19.995
These have grown.

22:20.423 --> 22:21.924
Yes.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.374
It seems like yesterday when
we planted them.

22:24.469 --> 22:25.834
Yeah.

22:25.929 --> 22:27.214
(grunts)

22:27.305 --> 22:28.920
How's your knee?

22:29.015 --> 22:32.428
Oh, it's fine. Just chasing
beautiful women up and
down the hills.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.850
A-huh.

22:33.937 --> 22:37.555
Well, why don't you come and
sit down here old man,

22:37.649 --> 22:39.230
or you'll give yourself
a heart attack.

22:39.317 --> 22:42.275
Don't... don't... don't you
"old man" me, woman.

22:42.362 --> 22:44.398
You're 200 cycles older
than I am.

22:44.489 --> 22:47.572
( chuckles )
( groans )

22:47.659 --> 22:52.028
Ennixx and that sleeping pill
she married have arrived.

22:52.997 --> 22:54.533
He's not that bad.

22:54.624 --> 22:55.955
He's boring.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.408
Just like everything else
around here, bor-ing.

22:58.503 --> 23:02.121
Well, I warned you.
I tried to make you go back.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.706
I know you did.

23:04.801 --> 23:10.091
John, I gave up being who I was,
what I was, 100 cycles ago.

23:10.181 --> 23:11.682
Why haven't you?

23:11.766 --> 23:14.132
Cause I ain't a gardener.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.842
I never wanted to be one.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.848
That's all we do around here.

23:17.939 --> 23:20.601
Garden. Plant things.

23:20.692 --> 23:23.024
l was a pilot, Aeryn.

23:23.111 --> 23:24.817
Astronaut.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.691
l was what I wanted to be.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.649
I ain't gonna forget that,
and I can't accept this.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.279
Do you regret this?

23:32.370 --> 23:33.610
What?

23:35.164 --> 23:38.622
Spending the last 55 cycles
here with me.

23:42.338 --> 23:46.297
Aeryn, you are the one thing
which has kept me

23:46.384 --> 23:49.922
from doing a kamikaze
in the Transporter.

23:50.013 --> 23:54.882
I just have to try to get back
to my old life, just for a day.

23:56.269 --> 23:58.009
That's the hope.

23:58.104 --> 24:01.517
Hope, that's what keeps
me going.

24:02.525 --> 24:05.062
All right.

24:05.153 --> 24:08.771
Just don't be too disappointed
if it doesn't happen.

24:09.240 --> 24:11.617
If you can't...

24:11.701 --> 24:13.657
( groaning )
-You okay?

24:13.745 --> 24:15.030
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm fine, I'm fine.

24:15.121 --> 24:17.407
It's just the same old pain,
same pain.

24:18.416 --> 24:19.952
Okay.

24:20.043 --> 24:23.331
Let's, uh, get you back
to the house.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.207
You can lie down. Come on.

24:25.298 --> 24:27.630
(locketjingling)
Oh, no, no, no.
I got it. I got it. -Give me that.

24:27.717 --> 24:30.424
Give it to me.
-I got your locket.

24:33.264 --> 24:35.300
Whose, uh, image you got
in here anyway?

24:35.391 --> 24:37.382
You know who's in there.

24:38.394 --> 24:39.804
Your husband?

24:39.896 --> 24:41.432
He's been dead 90 cycles.

24:41.522 --> 24:43.353
Why would you have his
image in there?

24:43.441 --> 24:45.853
Oh, just to drive you crazy.

24:47.445 --> 24:50.562
You know what I think?
-What?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.864
ldon't think it's him in there.

24:52.950 --> 24:54.611
I think you've got my picture.

24:54.702 --> 24:56.033
Don't flatter yourself.

24:56.120 --> 24:58.497
Yeah! Yeah, my picture.

24:58.581 --> 25:02.290
Surrounded by roses and
hearts and yotz.

25:02.377 --> 25:04.163
Open it, then.

25:04.712 --> 25:06.327
What?

25:06.422 --> 25:08.834
Take a look inside.
You'll see his image.

25:08.925 --> 25:11.416
The only love of my life.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.306
No.

25:20.812 --> 25:23.554
No, I don't wanna see
his ugly face.

25:25.608 --> 25:26.939
Come on.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.358
Let's get you back to the house.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.444
He wasn't ugly, you know.

25:32.532 --> 25:35.774
Yeah, you keep talking about
him and you can walk down
by yourself.

25:35.868 --> 25:37.324
Hell, you can roll
down the hill.

25:37.412 --> 25:38.902
(chuckling)

26:13.489 --> 26:16.276
Pilot, are you picking up
any transmissions?

26:16.367 --> 26:18.323
There's nothing.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.787
(rattling metal)

26:23.875 --> 26:27.459
50 cycles I've kept this
thing sealed up.

26:28.212 --> 26:29.418
Hope it works.

26:29.505 --> 26:30.915
(electronic beep)

26:31.007 --> 26:33.589
Pilot, can you hear me?

26:33.676 --> 26:36.133
(laughing)

26:36.220 --> 26:39.963
Been waiting to say that for
50 damn years. Feels good.

26:40.057 --> 26:42.844
Pilot! Can you hear me?!

26:42.935 --> 26:44.550
Why are you going?

26:44.645 --> 26:45.509
Pilot?!

26:45.605 --> 26:47.345
Stay with us.
-Pilot!

26:47.440 --> 26:51.729
Look, come back to the favored
planet and I will take
care of you.

26:51.819 --> 26:55.357
The mist is dangerous...
-Ennixx, listen to me.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.734
I grew up a Peacekeeper.

26:57.825 --> 27:01.818
We are born in space, and
we must die in space.

27:01.913 --> 27:04.325
But what about...?
-Now l have spent most
of my life

27:04.415 --> 27:08.658
down here with you, and
it has been glorious.

27:10.087 --> 27:13.579
But when I die,
I belong up there.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.674
Goodbye, Nana.

27:21.766 --> 27:23.631
Good girl. Now, go.

27:23.726 --> 27:25.887
Before I change my mind.

27:27.313 --> 27:28.644
Pilot?!

27:31.818 --> 27:33.354
( device beeps )

27:33.444 --> 27:35.059
Pilot!

27:36.322 --> 27:38.438
( static crackles )

27:41.244 --> 27:43.075
Nothing!

27:43.162 --> 27:45.619
I'm not getting anything!

27:45.706 --> 27:48.038
Wait. Something's happening.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.208
The opening in the mist,
I can see it forming.

27:51.295 --> 27:54.287
(Comms beeping)
John, Aeryn, can you hear us?

27:54.382 --> 27:56.293
( static crackles )

27:56.801 --> 27:58.007
John?

27:58.094 --> 27:59.300
( static crackles )

27:59.387 --> 28:01.127
John?!

28:03.599 --> 28:06.341
Aah, maybe this thing's bust.

28:06.435 --> 28:09.268
Maybe Moya decided not
to wait for us.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.016
No.

28:12.316 --> 28:14.853
Pilot, can you hear me?!

28:14.944 --> 28:16.730
Pilot, anybody?

28:16.821 --> 28:20.109
Pick up the damn phone,
you useless pieces of...
( static crackles )

28:20.199 --> 28:21.154
We hear you.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.652
Ho! Ah!

28:22.743 --> 28:25.325
Ho! Ho! Ah! Hello, D'Argo!

28:25.413 --> 28:27.028
Hey, hey, listen to this!

28:27.123 --> 28:30.286
D'Argo! It's me, John!

28:30.376 --> 28:31.616
John, are you all right?

28:31.711 --> 28:34.168
Can you make it back to Moya
or you want us down there?

28:34.255 --> 28:35.836
Oh, no, no, it's all right!

28:35.923 --> 28:37.459
We can get back up to you.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.836
We will come back up!

28:39.927 --> 28:41.337
Right away!

28:41.429 --> 28:42.919
( laughs )

28:43.014 --> 28:44.174
They waited!

28:44.265 --> 28:46.756
Oh, ho, ho, ho!

28:49.770 --> 28:51.226
They waited.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.929
Yes, they did.

28:53.024 --> 28:54.184
Come on.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.231
( groans )
Aeryn, baby, you all right?

28:56.319 --> 28:58.480
I'm all right. I'm fine.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.820
Let's get back to Moya.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.523
Going home.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.409
Going home.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.392
John?

29:44.283 --> 29:47.571
(faintly):
l... l...

29:47.662 --> 29:51.655
l tri-l tried to get back
here before, uh...

29:52.875 --> 29:55.491
She was old, weak...

29:56.253 --> 29:58.335
You, uh...

30:01.175 --> 30:03.040
She, uh...

30:04.428 --> 30:08.387
She died... on the way.

30:10.851 --> 30:13.012
She's gone.

30:14.188 --> 30:17.100
Aer... Aeryn's gone.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.356
( crying )

30:28.244 --> 30:32.988
The opening is on some kind of
inter-dimensional orbit.

30:33.082 --> 30:37.166
It appears in the mist over the
barren planet every 55 cycles.

30:37.253 --> 30:39.118
Do you know how to get
us out of the mist?

30:39.213 --> 30:42.501
Well, you could go back
down to where l was.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.001
Well, then let's do it.

30:44.093 --> 30:45.333
Let's go down there.

30:45.428 --> 30:46.838
Oh, there ain't nothin'
down there, Chiana.

30:46.929 --> 30:50.092
Just a few planets, a small
colony of people.

30:50.182 --> 30:54.266
I searched it from end to end.
There just isn't anything there.

30:54.353 --> 30:58.892
It still sounds better than
being stuck up here forever.

30:58.983 --> 31:01.725
Yeah, maybe.

31:02.820 --> 31:07.530
But I have had a lot of
time to think.

31:07.616 --> 31:11.450
I believe that if we can
get out of the mist

31:11.537 --> 31:15.746
at the exact point that
we entered it,

31:15.833 --> 31:18.791
I might be able to get
my life back.

31:18.878 --> 31:24.623
It might be an em later, maybe
200 cycles later but I...

31:24.717 --> 31:29.256
But how do we get back to that
exact point where we entered?

31:29.346 --> 31:31.211
Uh...
( clears throat)

31:31.307 --> 31:34.265
I might have an answer for that.

31:34.351 --> 31:38.811
I'm not sure but I think we
just have to go backwards.

31:38.898 --> 31:40.308
What do you mean, Pilot?

31:40.399 --> 31:44.483
Since we've entered it, I
think the mist has been
moving with us.

31:44.570 --> 31:50.361
I think the back of Moya is
still right at the edge
of the mist.

31:50.451 --> 31:53.113
Then go for it. Just back up.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.115
I've been trying to but I can't.

31:55.206 --> 32:01.202
The mist has hardened so much
in the last arn, Moya can
no longer move.

32:01.295 --> 32:03.035
You mean, we're stuck.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.667
I'm afraid so.

32:05.758 --> 32:07.669
Have you tried Starburst?

32:07.760 --> 32:12.049
A Leviathan is not structurally
designed for a reverse
Starburst.

32:12.139 --> 32:13.595
It could destroy us.

32:13.682 --> 32:17.345
Pilot, just do a small jump and
get us back to where
we started.

32:18.270 --> 32:19.180
No.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.227
If we're going to try and
Starburst out,

32:21.315 --> 32:25.604
I think we should go forward
down to the planet,
not backwards.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.436
Is that what you want?

32:29.990 --> 32:34.450
You want that?
You wanna live your life
on that planet?

32:36.789 --> 32:42.705
A place where you'll never see
anyone you know ever again.

32:47.216 --> 32:48.422
(sighs)

32:48.509 --> 32:51.342
l have done that.

32:51.428 --> 32:58.470
And let me assure you, whatever
the risk, it is worth getting
your life back.

33:01.730 --> 33:04.187
I'm with John.

33:04.275 --> 33:07.187
I do not want to live a
life without a past.

33:07.278 --> 33:09.234
I want to see my son again.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.196
Me, too.

33:13.284 --> 33:15.195
I never wanted to go into
the mist anyway.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.698
I guess I'm in agreement
as well.

33:17.788 --> 33:20.165
Goddess be with us all.

33:20.249 --> 33:23.241
Pilot, start initiating the
sequence for reverse Starburst.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.541
John!

33:26.297 --> 33:28.379
Leave him, D'Argo.

33:36.974 --> 33:39.556
Aeryn?

33:39.643 --> 33:41.474
We're gonna try to get
out of this.

33:41.562 --> 33:44.645
I told them our plan, and uh...

33:48.360 --> 33:50.396
Oh...

33:51.697 --> 33:53.983
Oh, baby.

33:55.826 --> 34:02.413
There are so many places that
I wanted you to see. People.

34:03.959 --> 34:07.201
There's this lake in Maine.

34:07.296 --> 34:10.288
Used to spend summers there
when l was a kid.

34:11.717 --> 34:15.130
Had more mosquitoes than
a dog had fleas.

34:16.138 --> 34:19.005
My dad and l, we'd
camp out there.

34:20.601 --> 34:27.222
And one night, the astronauts
landed on the moon.

34:27.316 --> 34:30.149
I remember looking up
at the sky.

34:32.112 --> 34:35.946
I knew right then what I was
gonna do with the rest
of my life.

34:37.868 --> 34:40.826
I couldn't have been more
than four years old.

34:43.249 --> 34:46.366
Yeah, I really wanted you
to see that.

34:47.711 --> 34:50.999
Oh, damn.

34:51.090 --> 34:53.456
Baby,Lu

34:54.551 --> 34:57.793
I miss you already.

34:59.598 --> 35:03.090
Who else am I going to
tell this crap to?

35:13.988 --> 35:15.819
I love you.

35:35.217 --> 35:37.458
Aeryn:
Take a look inside.
You'll see his image.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.720
The only love of my life.

35:52.026 --> 35:56.315
Priming first phase of
reverse Starburst.

35:56.405 --> 35:59.067
Kahaynu, protect Moya.

36:07.958 --> 36:09.619
( loud crash )

36:11.086 --> 36:13.623
What now?

36:13.714 --> 36:15.454
Zhaan, what's going on?

36:15.549 --> 36:17.585
Pilot!

36:17.676 --> 36:19.212
What's happening?

36:19.303 --> 36:23.842
Priming for Starburst is
making everything stop.

36:23.932 --> 36:27.015
We must break free!

36:27.102 --> 36:29.889
My arms, I can't move.

36:29.980 --> 36:35.145
You must initiate manual
Starburst from Command.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.612
Do it!

36:44.370 --> 36:49.080
I can't reach the panel!

36:49.166 --> 36:53.205
Help us!

36:53.295 --> 37:00.167
Stark! Crichton and I once
shared Unity.

37:00.260 --> 37:04.048
So I can help him.

37:04.139 --> 37:12.228
If we join, we can keep
time alive for him.

37:22.908 --> 37:25.399
John? John?

37:25.786 --> 37:27.196
John?

37:27.287 --> 37:30.779
Zhaan, how the hell are
you talking to me?

37:30.874 --> 37:33.331
| fused my spirit with Stark.

37:33.419 --> 37:37.253
You must get to Command
and initiate Starburst.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.921
Why can't Pilot do it?

37:40.008 --> 37:42.044
He can't move.

37:42.136 --> 37:44.548
No one can move except you.

37:44.638 --> 37:48.005
I don't know how long
I can keep time alive.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.260
Hurry, John.

37:49.351 --> 37:54.015
I am too old for this shit.

38:12.040 --> 38:17.034
Hurry John!
This is ripping us apart.

38:19.965 --> 38:25.255
You must... you must keep going!

38:25.345 --> 38:28.212
( echoes )
Keep going!

39:04.593 --> 39:06.299
Crichton:
What the hell is this stuff?

39:06.386 --> 39:10.174
Pilot:
It appears to be some kind
of stellar mist.

39:10.265 --> 39:13.678
I'm running tests on its
chemical properties now.

39:15.687 --> 39:18.099
What do you think?
That we should go in there?

39:18.190 --> 39:21.648
Well, it might be a good place
to hide from Peacekeepers.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.317
No, Scorpius hasn't been
chasing us for a while.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.362
I'm not sure we should
go in there.

39:27.449 --> 39:29.064
Don't worry, Chiana.

39:29.159 --> 39:32.117
l'll fly a long-range recon
in a Transport Pod to make
sure it's safe.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.409
No.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.740
No!

39:40.754 --> 39:42.119
What's that?

39:42.214 --> 39:44.421
Just something Zhaan gave me
for my headaches.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.256
Pilot!

39:50.347 --> 39:51.837
Pilot!

39:51.932 --> 39:53.763
Stark!
-You know what they're
about to do?

39:53.850 --> 39:56.011
Yes, and these frelling
Comms don't work.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.684
Pilot! Pilot!

39:57.771 --> 39:59.887
Pilot, looks like we're
all agreed here.

39:59.982 --> 40:01.267
Except me.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.689
Except for Chiana.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.643
Let's head into the mist.
-Accelerating now.

40:05.737 --> 40:08.444
Stop! Pilot stop the
acceleration!

40:10.409 --> 40:11.569
You're young.

40:12.244 --> 40:13.575
Uh-huh.

40:16.415 --> 40:18.280
Zhaan, you all right?

40:18.375 --> 40:20.161
What are you doing here?

40:20.252 --> 40:23.870
I thought you were locked in
your chamber meditating or
some yotz like that.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.295
Shut up, Rygel.

40:25.382 --> 40:26.713
What's the matter, Zhaan?

40:26.800 --> 40:27.789
Don't you remember?

40:27.884 --> 40:30.626
Remember what?

40:30.721 --> 40:33.554
Just trust us.
Don't go into the mist.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.219
Why not?

40:37.978 --> 40:39.718
We had a vision.

40:39.813 --> 40:41.178
We sense there's danger
in there.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.308
I told them.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.060
I told them we shouldn't
go in there.

40:44.151 --> 40:47.143
I felt something too, Zhaan.

40:47.237 --> 40:49.899
Pilot, uh, change of plan.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.776
Hang a louie.

40:51.867 --> 40:55.405
That's left, away from
the mist.

40:55.495 --> 40:58.362
Pilot:
Hard acceleration. Away.

41:01.376 --> 41:05.289
Stark, how is it that Aeryn and
Crichton are young again?

41:05.380 --> 41:09.919
We seem to have returned to a
time just moments before Moya
went into the mist.

41:10.010 --> 41:13.218
None of them remember anything,
yet... yet we do.

41:13.305 --> 41:16.138
Because we've returned to a
time before any of it happened.

41:16.224 --> 41:18.180
They have nothing to
remember, Zhaan.

41:18.268 --> 41:22.762
I think we only remember
because we were joined when
Moya broke free.

41:22.856 --> 41:26.223
Well, what about Aeryn's life
and the family she had?

41:26.318 --> 41:29.526
Let's theorize that through
every opening in a Center Halo,

41:29.613 --> 41:33.856
our world splits into an
infinite number of universes.

41:33.950 --> 41:36.783
Are you saying that Ennixx
could still be alive?

41:36.870 --> 41:40.829
Yes. And mourning the loss
of her grandmother.

41:40.916 --> 41:42.702
(sighs)

41:42.793 --> 41:47.878
But... it's time to tell
Ka D'Argo why I came aboard.

41:50.133 --> 41:52.044
(computer beeping )

41:56.098 --> 41:57.838
D'Argo,

41:59.142 --> 42:01.554
um, I've been waiting to
show you this.

42:04.648 --> 42:09.483
I found it in a manifest of
slaves being sold to the
Katin mines.

42:12.406 --> 42:13.486
Who is this?

42:13.573 --> 42:16.781
The manifest lists him as...

42:16.868 --> 42:20.486
as Jothee, son of Ka D'Argo.

42:24.960 --> 42:26.916
My son.

42:30.966 --> 42:34.879
My son is being sold
into slavery.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.967
(grunting angrily)

42:40.058 --> 42:41.844
D'Argo!

42:41.935 --> 42:44.551
How long have you known?!
Why didn't you tell me?!

42:44.646 --> 42:46.432
| just found out.

42:46.523 --> 42:49.515
D'Argo, Stark wanted me awake
before he told you!

42:49.609 --> 42:51.565
D'Argo, let him go, please!

42:51.653 --> 42:55.066
There's plenty of time.
The auction isn't for
a few solar days.

42:55.157 --> 42:58.024
We will find a way to
rescue Jothee.

42:58.118 --> 42:59.574
D'Argo...

43:00.579 --> 43:02.365
D'Argo.

43:04.416 --> 43:06.452
(whispering ):
D'Argo.

43:06.543 --> 43:08.454
All right.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.373
I'm sorry, Stark.

43:11.465 --> 43:13.171
l, uh...

43:13.258 --> 43:15.590
(panting)

43:15.677 --> 43:19.135
I've got... I've got to...

43:19.222 --> 43:21.213
save my son, Zhaan.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.730
We've got to find a way.

43:33.987 --> 43:36.319
(sighs)

43:42.037 --> 43:43.652
What?

43:44.456 --> 43:46.447
Nothing. Um...

43:47.918 --> 43:50.125
do you get a feeling?

43:50.587 --> 43:52.919
About what?

43:53.006 --> 43:57.966
I don't know. l-l just have
this... feeling...

43:58.929 --> 44:01.045
something happened.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.675
Between us?

44:02.766 --> 44:04.381
Yeah.

44:05.769 --> 44:10.103
Well, what kind of something
do you think happened?

44:12.400 --> 44:14.686
I don't know.

44:16.363 --> 44:19.730
If something happened, I'm sure
we would have remembered.

44:22.410 --> 44:23.786
Yeah.

44:24.871 --> 44:27.248
Come here. Have a look at this.

44:28.959 --> 44:32.668
It's ah, the locket Chiana
gave me. I found it in
the Transport Pod,

44:32.754 --> 44:36.121
and somehow it's fused shut.
I'm trying to...

44:36.216 --> 44:37.422
Did you put something in there?

44:37.509 --> 44:39.170
No, nothing.

44:40.220 --> 44:42.506
(grunts)

44:42.597 --> 44:44.849
Looks like something
disintegrated in there.

44:54.234 --> 44:55.895
Hmm.
