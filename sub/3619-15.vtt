WEBVTT

00:02.045 --> 00:04.091
So the wizard didn't realize
the weight of the book,

00:04.265 --> 00:06.832
and after he put them
on the shelves,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.660
they blew up everywhere,

00:08.834 --> 00:11.881
and he had to re-conjure
the entire library magically.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.796
But because he
was a wizard,

00:13.970 --> 00:15.145
it only took him
a couple of minutes.

00:15.319 --> 00:16.755
[laughing]

00:16.929 --> 00:18.931
Yeah, it's a cute story.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.324
[sotto voce]:
Yeah, the first couple
thousand times you tell it.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.109
Excuse me?

00:22.283 --> 00:25.329
Nothing. So that's pretty much
the bulk of the tour.

00:25.503 --> 00:27.853
Would you like to know anything
else about the facilities,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.072
the students, teachers...?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.074
[kids laughing]

00:34.034 --> 00:37.211
Boy... [coughs]
that was swinging.

00:38.038 --> 00:39.387
Hi.

00:39.561 --> 00:40.953
Hi. This is

00:41.128 --> 00:42.607
Professor Drake.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.783
Uh, this is April, one
of the students who's applying.

00:44.957 --> 00:46.481
Oh, salutations.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.656
How do you do?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.397
Hello.
Drake is

00:49.571 --> 00:51.486
our visiting lecturer on
advanced magical compositions.

00:51.660 --> 00:52.835
In this case,
magical

00:53.009 --> 00:54.445
musical compositions.

00:54.619 --> 00:55.620
That's the use

00:55.794 --> 00:57.100
of meter and tempo

00:57.274 --> 00:59.363
in spell casting and conjuring.

00:59.537 --> 01:01.409
[growling and banging]

01:01.583 --> 01:02.497
Oh, the troll is here.

01:02.671 --> 01:03.889
[growling and banging continues]

01:04.064 --> 01:05.500
Why don't we see
if he'll dance for us.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.503
[mouths]:
Come on.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.985
Hey, you put them down.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.291
All of them.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.685
Wow, will I get
to take his class?

01:16.859 --> 01:18.121
Sure, why not?

01:18.295 --> 01:19.688
Yeah, actually
Professor Drake

01:19.862 --> 01:21.037
is going to be going
on sabbatical...

01:21.211 --> 01:22.038
Oh.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.518
...in about a week.

01:23.692 --> 01:24.954
That's right.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.912
I forgot about that
little wrinkle.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.000
But with eager minds,

01:28.175 --> 01:29.524
and the power of magic,

01:29.698 --> 01:31.743
it is Midsummer Madness
all the time.

01:31.917 --> 01:34.181
[banging and crashing]Now if you'll excuse me,

01:34.355 --> 01:35.660

They're trapped.[sirens blaring]

03:14.455 --> 03:15.760
We're all trapped.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.807
I don't want to hurt anybody.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.678
They're all trapped!

03:20.852 --> 03:21.853
No, listen!

03:22.027 --> 03:23.203
I don't want
to hurt nobody,

03:23.377 --> 03:24.421
but I need somebody
to listen to me.

03:24.595 --> 03:26.118
We need help.
We need help.

03:30.645 --> 03:32.777
No. You don't understand.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.257
You don't understand the fire.

03:34.431 --> 03:35.954
OFFICER:
Just relax, pal.

03:36.128 --> 03:37.086
You're under arrest.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.306
[groans]

03:40.611 --> 03:41.830
We've got to help Marie.

03:42.004 --> 03:43.048
Just calm down, buddy.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.267
[crying]
Come on.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.790
Everything's
gonna be okay.
No.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.879
No, it won't. You don't
understand the fire.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.838
You have to let me
go so I can get help.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.623
They're gonna burn!
They're gonna burn!

03:55.322 --> 03:57.280
[people screaming]

03:59.761 --> 04:02.329
PIPER:
Uh, rain gear for the kids?

04:02.503 --> 04:05.288
LEO:
Yes.
Camera and film?

04:05.462 --> 04:08.160
Of course.
Extra room

04:08.335 --> 04:11.338
for my... pattini?

04:12.382 --> 04:13.340
Pattini?

04:15.472 --> 04:18.519
Shoes. It's not
a vacation in Italia

04:18.693 --> 04:20.738
if you don't have new shoes.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.653
Right.

04:23.959 --> 04:25.700
What's the matter?I don't know.

04:25.874 --> 04:27.441
I guess I still don't think
that this is such a good idea.

04:27.615 --> 04:30.444
Why not? In Hong Kong,
we'll buy you some suits

04:30.618 --> 04:33.011
or bootleg DVDs or something.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.753
No, it's not the shopping,
it's this whole...

04:35.927 --> 04:37.581
world vacation thing.

04:37.755 --> 04:38.843
I just think

04:39.017 --> 04:40.105
we should stay here and wait

04:40.280 --> 04:41.759
for the Elders decision on me.

04:41.933 --> 04:45.023
Absolutely not. That's precisely
why we should be going.

04:45.197 --> 04:46.416
Look, we're all together,

04:46.590 --> 04:47.939
we deserve a vacation,

04:48.113 --> 04:49.550
and we're not gonna sit around

04:49.724 --> 04:51.160
and wait for the other
pattini to drop.

04:51.334 --> 04:52.727
So that's that, we're going.

04:52.901 --> 04:54.598
Well, what about the travel
and the cost?

04:56.731 --> 04:59.299
Oh, for God's sakes,
Leo, we're orbing.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.431
Okay, well, uh...
what about Phoebe and Paige?

05:01.605 --> 05:02.606
What about them?

05:02.780 --> 05:04.042
Well, they made us this big

05:04.216 --> 05:05.653
sendoff dinner last night...

05:05.827 --> 05:07.959
Oh, please. They ordered pizza.

05:08.133 --> 05:10.353
Right, and we're not helping
with the cleanup.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.224
[sighs]
Wow, if that's the best you got,

05:12.399 --> 05:13.922
you really do need a vacation.

05:14.096 --> 05:16.316
But... Arresto!

05:16.490 --> 05:18.230
Look, Phoebe

05:18.405 --> 05:19.841
and Paige just remade

05:20.015 --> 05:22.017
the world, I think they
can handle the kitchen.

05:22.191 --> 05:23.758
[moans]
Now unless you have

05:23.932 --> 05:26.761
any more objections,

05:26.935 --> 05:30.504
ahh...
Wyatt, veneti qui.

05:30.678 --> 05:32.636
Leaning Tower of Pisa,
here we come.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.903
I know, but Elise, why can't
we just do the interview here?

05:39.077 --> 05:42.124
You know, kind of like
an "Ask Phoebe at Home" thing?

05:42.298 --> 05:44.126
Oh, yeah, the place looks great.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.302
Yeah, call him,
I'll hold on.

05:46.476 --> 05:49.174
Oh.
That sounds exciting.

05:49.349 --> 05:50.437
I guess.

05:50.611 --> 05:51.873
What do you mean?

05:52.047 --> 05:53.962
You have Cosmoprofiling you,

05:54.136 --> 05:56.747
that would be great
at any time, geesh.

05:56.921 --> 05:58.227
I know, but I still want to make
the most out of my day.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.360
Phoebe,

06:00.534 --> 06:03.754
you asked to meet me
here at, um... 8:22.

06:03.928 --> 06:05.539
That's not making
the most of your day,

06:05.713 --> 06:08.150
that's some sort
of weird OCD thing.

06:08.324 --> 06:09.847
What's going on?

06:10.021 --> 06:11.849
I don't know.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.677
Maybe meeting Drake
and realizing

06:13.851 --> 06:15.200
what little time
he has left

06:15.375 --> 06:16.419
has made me want
to make the most

06:16.593 --> 06:17.855
of the time I have left.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.030
You know, time's a-wasting.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.771
Hmm, yeah.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.947
Well, at least
you're not wasting

06:23.121 --> 06:24.384
all your time
at Magic School.

06:24.558 --> 06:25.776
[doorbell rings]

06:27.169 --> 06:29.214
Yeah, Elise, I'm still here.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.955
Oh, they can move it,
that's perfect.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.957
Okay, just as long
as the shoot's over by 3:00

06:33.131 --> 06:35.046
'cause I'm speaking
at City College.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.484
All right, I'll be there
in like 25 minutes.

06:38.528 --> 06:39.790
Geesh, woman,
you're a machine.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.444
Every moment counts.
Can you do me a favor

06:41.618 --> 06:43.011
and help me get this place
cleaned up by 2:00?

06:43.185 --> 06:44.752
Great, thanks!

06:45.796 --> 06:47.102
Hey, Darryl,
how you doing? Gotta go.

06:47.276 --> 06:48.190
Whoa, hold on a second.
I need...

06:48.364 --> 06:49.713
I need your help. Hi, Paige.

06:49.887 --> 06:51.933
Oh, I was afraid you
were gonna say that.

06:52.107 --> 06:53.500
What's the matter?

06:53.674 --> 06:55.327
I'm not sure, but I think
I've been around

06:55.502 --> 06:56.894
you guys long enough to know
when something is not right.

06:57.068 --> 06:58.722
What do you mean,
something magically wrong?

06:58.896 --> 07:00.028
I don't know what else
it could be.

07:00.202 --> 07:01.899
Listen, I'm on
the clock here,

07:02.073 --> 07:03.248
so you gotta speed
this up a little.Okay, look,

07:03.423 --> 07:04.424
my friend Mike,

07:04.598 --> 07:06.034
my mentor actually--
he's the one

07:06.208 --> 07:07.775
that brought me into the
force-- I think that...

07:07.949 --> 07:09.037
he might be,
uh... you know,

07:09.211 --> 07:10.255
possessed, maybe.

07:10.430 --> 07:11.605
He's not crazy.

07:11.779 --> 07:12.997
I don't care what
anybody says.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.695
I mean, Mike would not
hurt a fly.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.524
Well, wait, back up
to the possessed thing, please.

07:17.698 --> 07:19.395
Well, since Mike retired,
he's been working

07:19.569 --> 07:21.745
this jewelry store
security on Market.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.051
And lately he's

07:23.225 --> 07:25.401
been having these, uh...
episodes.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.185
What kind of episodes?

07:27.359 --> 07:29.274
Well, they've been happening
more and more frequently lately,

07:29.449 --> 07:30.928
until yesterday
when he just snapped.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.626
He started waving his gun
around, talking about

07:32.800 --> 07:36.760
he's gonna die at some terrible
fire at Cabaret Fantome.

07:36.934 --> 07:38.762
I haven't heard of that place.

07:38.936 --> 07:41.635
Look, I haven't asked you guys

07:41.809 --> 07:43.201
for help like this before.

07:43.375 --> 07:45.726
Okay, well, if I move

07:45.900 --> 07:47.858
my staff meeting
to 11:00 and my 1:00

07:48.032 --> 07:49.947
to 1:30, I should be able
to help you right now.

07:50.121 --> 07:53.081
So, I will check
the archives for the club.

07:53.255 --> 07:55.910
Paige, you go with Darryl
and check out this Mike guy,

07:56.084 --> 07:58.478
and we'll meet back here
at, like, I don't know, 1:10.

08:02.090 --> 08:04.440
[Mike screams]

08:04.614 --> 08:08.009
I need... I need
somebody to listen to me!

08:08.183 --> 08:10.141
I don't have much time,
you understand?

08:10.315 --> 08:13.318
I don't have much time!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.451
[Mike continues screaming]

08:16.670 --> 08:18.628
You see what I mean?

08:19.673 --> 08:21.501
It doesn't seem demonic.

08:21.675 --> 08:23.285
Not demonic--
I'm telling you,

08:23.459 --> 08:24.808
he doesn't even
know who I am.

08:24.982 --> 08:26.723
He acts like he doesn't
even know who he is.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.246
Help me! Let me
get out of here!

08:28.420 --> 08:32.337
He just mostly seems
afraid and panicky.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.689
All right, here goes.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.821
[sobbing hysterically]

08:41.521 --> 08:43.914
Hi, I, uh... I'm...Marie!

08:46.700 --> 08:48.571
No, I'm Paige.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.531
Who's Marie?
My fiancée.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.142
She's trapped, too.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.491
Trapped where?

08:55.665 --> 08:57.362
At the club, with
everybody else.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.016
Cabaret Fantome?

08:59.190 --> 09:00.627
Yes, yes! You know it?

09:00.801 --> 09:03.064
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You believe me?

09:03.238 --> 09:04.761
Just relax, Mike.

09:04.935 --> 09:06.676
No! My name is George.

09:06.850 --> 09:08.330
I keep telling you that!

09:08.504 --> 09:10.506
We're all gonna die.
Don't you understand that?

09:10.680 --> 09:12.856
Huh?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.729
If that's not possession,
what is it?

09:15.903 --> 09:17.774
[Mike continues sobbing]

09:17.948 --> 09:20.124
PHOEBE:
Cabaret Fantome, deadly fire.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.910
Maybe Darryl's friend
isn't so crazy after all.

09:23.084 --> 09:24.738
It seems that the Count's
club was the biggest,

09:24.912 --> 09:26.522
most corrupt
in the city.

09:26.696 --> 09:29.046
Right until it burned down,
killing everyone inside.

09:29.220 --> 09:30.874
Okay, but why would
the Count set the fire

09:31.048 --> 09:32.223
in the club only
to die in it himself?

09:32.397 --> 09:33.790
I don't know.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.575
Maybe he couldn't
get out fast enough?

09:35.749 --> 09:37.751
Maybe we should talk to George.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.970
George, who's George?

09:40.144 --> 09:43.365
If I'm right, he's somebody
who died in the fire.

09:43.539 --> 09:46.107
I think he's a spirit
that's possessed Mike

09:46.281 --> 09:47.499
and he's crying out for help.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.284
Yeah, but why
would he need help?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.199
The fire happened
over a hundred years ago.

09:51.373 --> 09:52.592
DRAKE:
Help from the pain of being

09:52.766 --> 09:53.854
a lost soul, perhaps.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.682
Paige asked me
to do a little

09:55.856 --> 09:58.598
research in between classes.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.817
Possessions, Confessions,
and Ghostly Obsessions,

10:00.991 --> 10:03.124
a Demon's Guide
to Everything Magical.

10:03.298 --> 10:04.908
Yeah, I used to sell
these things lair to lair.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.301
Talk about a tough item to move.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.259
Badda bump, bump.

10:09.565 --> 10:10.871
"Lost souls

10:11.045 --> 10:13.221
"or spirits of the dead
unable to move on

10:13.395 --> 10:15.571
because of spiritual confusion"?

10:15.745 --> 10:17.442
That's when, uh, souls die

10:17.617 --> 10:19.227
a violent death together.

10:20.620 --> 10:23.666
The fires of Gomorrah,
the flood of Pompeii.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.841
[book rumbles]

10:25.015 --> 10:27.931
I would step back.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.629
The book likes to show off
a little, don't you?

10:32.022 --> 10:33.545
What the hell?

10:33.720 --> 10:35.983
Oh, don't be afraid.
It's simply illustrating a point

10:36.157 --> 10:38.028
that when souls die at once,

10:38.202 --> 10:39.508
the good ones can't move on

10:39.682 --> 10:40.509
because the bad ones
are holding them back

10:40.683 --> 10:41.902
and vice versa.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.599
They're lost, they're stuck

10:43.773 --> 10:45.775
in their respective after lives,

10:45.949 --> 10:47.385
unaware of their tragic fate.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.171
It's very sad actually.

10:52.216 --> 10:53.696
Okay, but if they're unaware,

10:53.870 --> 10:55.742
how are we supposed
to help George?

10:55.916 --> 10:58.048
We can't...
unless we enter his world

10:58.222 --> 10:59.876
and find out which
one of those

11:00.050 --> 11:02.313
bad souls is holding him back.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.098
Excuse me?

11:04.272 --> 11:06.361
Well, this spell
would get us there,

11:06.535 --> 11:08.276
but I'm not gonna tell you
what it is unless you take me.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.452
Wait... us?

11:10.626 --> 11:13.150
Come on, how many chances do we
have to go back to the 1890s?

11:13.324 --> 11:15.675
Yeah, it's not going to the
1890s that's the problem,

11:15.849 --> 11:17.633
it's getting back
from the 1890s.

11:17.807 --> 11:19.722
Well, don't you worry there,
little lady.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.637
The spell will only keep us
with the souls

11:21.811 --> 11:23.117
until the moment
they become lost.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.032
In this case,
it's when the fire begins.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.076
Okay, well, how do we
free George?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.687
I don't know, we wing it.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.602
Uh, okay... I don't know.

11:30.777 --> 11:32.822
I'm gonna go check out
some other things.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.042
All right, you don't have
to go, but you do.

11:35.216 --> 11:36.696
I can't.

11:36.870 --> 11:38.698
I have an interview today.Oh, come on.

11:38.872 --> 11:40.003
Interview-shminterview.
How does an interview

11:40.177 --> 11:41.439
weigh in against the
fate of an innocent?

11:41.613 --> 11:43.224
And if we are to help,

11:43.398 --> 11:45.617
then your premonition skills
could prove essential.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.969
And it is the next logical step
in our whirlwind romance.

11:49.143 --> 11:52.015
What whirlwind romance?

11:52.189 --> 11:54.365
The one we'd be having
if we had time.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.759
Just come on, I don't have long
to live, I'm dying here.

11:56.933 --> 11:58.587
And a soul needs
your help.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.154
So what do you say?

12:00.328 --> 12:01.895
[sighs]

12:14.646 --> 12:15.865
[sighs]

12:16.039 --> 12:17.475
Are you sure this
is the place?

12:17.649 --> 12:19.913
It says here is where
the cabaret used to be.

12:20.087 --> 12:23.481
A vacant lot after 106 years?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.005
It's probably haunted.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.398
Or better yet, cursed.
Cool, let's go.

12:27.572 --> 12:30.358
Is there a special reason
we can't do this from home?

12:30.532 --> 12:32.055
Yeah, the closer
we are to where
the souls were lost,

12:32.229 --> 12:33.230
the better the chances
we are of finding

12:33.404 --> 12:35.319
the exact one we are
looking for.

12:35.493 --> 12:36.886
Excuse me.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.540
Safety first.

12:38.714 --> 12:39.976
Wha...?

12:41.064 --> 12:42.370
[Phoebe laughs]

12:42.544 --> 12:43.675
What are you doing?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.504
Getting comfortable. What else?

12:46.678 --> 12:47.767
You don't want my body

12:47.941 --> 12:49.725
slumped in the
front seat.

12:49.899 --> 12:50.944
It's too conspicuous.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.948
Phoebe, living
isn't about tasks.

12:55.122 --> 12:56.732
It's about living.

12:59.343 --> 13:00.431
All right, so Paige are you
gonna make sure Elise

13:00.605 --> 13:02.259
bumps my interview two hours?

13:02.433 --> 13:03.739
I'm all over it.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.306
And we will be back
before two hours?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.787
Yeah, we'll return
just when the fire begins.

13:07.961 --> 13:10.920
Which, based on what you said
about George, seems imminent.

13:11.094 --> 13:12.922
"Free our souls
from their shells,

13:13.096 --> 13:15.185

"Long enough to find
their pain, quick enough

13:17.622 --> 13:19.407
to return again."

13:28.329 --> 13:29.591
Oh, my!

13:29.765 --> 13:31.419

13:34.509 --> 13:35.902
DRAKE:
Fantastic!

13:36.076 --> 13:38.905
Well, you look stunning.

13:39.079 --> 13:41.168
Why, thank you.

13:41.342 --> 13:42.604
You don't look so bad yourself.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.475
Why, thank you
very much.
Hmm.

13:47.522 --> 13:50.003
So, what do we do now?

13:50.177 --> 13:52.135
We mingle.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.974
Ladies, please.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.500
Toulouse, who
the hell is that?

14:10.501 --> 14:12.068
Um...

14:12.242 --> 14:13.853
never seen him
before, boss.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.202
Nor have I.

14:15.376 --> 14:17.334
Find out who they are.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.260
[cabaret music playing]

14:31.566 --> 14:32.872
Pardon us.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.874
So all of these
people are stuck

14:35.048 --> 14:36.963
in some, like,
ghostly limbo?

14:37.137 --> 14:38.355
As if the fire
never happened?

14:38.529 --> 14:39.966
Well, it happened
all right.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.402
Otherwise they
wouldn't be here.[purrs]

14:41.576 --> 14:42.969
All right, keep your
eyes in your sockets,

14:43.143 --> 14:44.709
buddy, we're here for
George, remember?

14:44.884 --> 14:47.060
Well, that doesn't mean
we can't enjoy ourselves.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.975
Come on, it's 1899.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.541
You may not remember it,
but boy, I do.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.718
What, the Gilded Age?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.590
It's a time
when everyone thought

14:55.764 --> 14:57.897
life couldn't possibly
get any better.

14:59.159 --> 15:00.987
There was science,
there was art.

15:01.161 --> 15:02.292
There was peace, hello.

15:02.466 --> 15:03.903
And romance.

15:04.077 --> 15:05.252
Everything was a celebration.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.515
This is a celebration?

15:07.689 --> 15:08.995
Everyone's dead,

George?

George?

What did you
do to him?

15:14.478 --> 15:15.915
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.829
Don't lie to me. I saw him
over here talking to you

15:18.004 --> 15:19.222
and now he's gone.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.442
What can I say?
He likes my cards.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.487
Still, I don't know
where he is.

15:23.661 --> 15:25.228
Now if you will excuse me.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.664
Please, dear.

15:26.838 --> 15:27.665
[huffing]

15:27.839 --> 15:29.276
Uh, excuse me?

15:29.450 --> 15:30.755
I couldn't help
but overhearing.

15:30.930 --> 15:31.931
Do you know George?

15:32.105 --> 15:33.802
Who are you?

15:33.976 --> 15:35.673
That doesn't matter.
But what does matter

15:35.847 --> 15:38.067
is that George came
to us for help.

15:39.329 --> 15:40.635
About the fire?

15:40.809 --> 15:41.941
What fire? What are
you talking about?

15:43.116 --> 15:45.031
I don't have time for this.

15:45.205 --> 15:47.120
Wait, so she doesn't know
about the fire either?

15:47.294 --> 15:48.860
That's because it
hasn't happened yet.

15:49.035 --> 15:50.253
Not as far as
she's concerned,

15:50.427 --> 15:51.907
not as far as they're
all concerned.

15:52.081 --> 15:54.214
Huh?
Don't you see
that they're doomed

15:54.388 --> 15:56.259
to repeat the last few
hours over and over again.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.348
It's kind of like a
never-ending loop.

15:58.522 --> 16:00.437
Oh, that's just terrible.

16:00.611 --> 16:02.265
What could possibly
cause such a thing?

16:02.439 --> 16:03.658
What or who?

16:09.490 --> 16:10.882
Well?

16:11.057 --> 16:13.015
Well, they're not
the law, but, um...

16:13.189 --> 16:14.625
I don't know where
they came from.

16:14.799 --> 16:16.627
Well, I'm more interested
in how they got in.

16:18.020 --> 16:19.152
And if they're my way out.

16:21.806 --> 16:23.112
What do you mean?

16:23.286 --> 16:25.506
Toulouse, what if
I was to tell you

16:25.680 --> 16:27.334
that everyone in this
room has been reliving

16:27.508 --> 16:29.205
this same night for
over a hundred years?

16:29.379 --> 16:31.207
Like rats on a wheel.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.295
Only nobody knows it

16:32.469 --> 16:34.515
but me.

16:34.689 --> 16:37.170
And what if,
no matter what anybody did,

16:37.344 --> 16:39.041
or how hard they tried,

16:39.215 --> 16:40.825
there's absolutely no way out?

16:41.000 --> 16:43.915
And all the drinking
and gambling

16:44.090 --> 16:45.700
and the girls...

16:45.874 --> 16:48.181
Well, what if they
didn't mean squat?

16:48.355 --> 16:49.312
And what if--

16:49.486 --> 16:51.271
you'll love this-- I told you

16:51.445 --> 16:53.621
that it was going to be
like that forever?

16:55.492 --> 16:56.493
Forever.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.799
What would
you say, then?

16:57.973 --> 16:59.714
Well, um...

16:59.888 --> 17:01.063
would I get to keep my tips?

17:01.237 --> 17:03.239
Mm.

17:04.153 --> 17:05.328
Bring me a scotch.

17:06.590 --> 17:07.765
Champagne for the lady

17:07.939 --> 17:09.854
and a cigar for the gentleman.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.379
I want them to be comfortable
when I meet them.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.511
Yes, sir.

17:19.342 --> 17:21.692
Okay, if you guys are
not back in two minutes,

17:21.866 --> 17:23.477
I'm calling Piper.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.053
[doorbell rings]

17:36.446 --> 17:38.840
Hey, Elise.

17:39.014 --> 17:40.059
What are you doing here?

17:40.233 --> 17:43.062
Well, what do you mean?

17:43.236 --> 17:44.672
I'm here with Cosmo
for the photo shoot.

17:44.846 --> 17:46.065
Where's Phoebe?

17:46.239 --> 17:49.503
Uh... Phoebe...

17:49.677 --> 17:50.982
Didn't you get her message?

17:51.157 --> 17:52.288
Yeah, she said she's gonna
have to reschedule.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.376
What?

17:53.550 --> 17:56.379
Yeah, just for a couple hours.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.516
I never got the message
to push the shoot.

18:02.690 --> 18:03.647
Are you out of your mind?

18:03.821 --> 18:05.127
We're talking

18:05.301 --> 18:06.998
national exposure
here for her column.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.523
The kind you can't
buy and the deadline
is tonight.

18:09.697 --> 18:12.134
And no, I can't just...

18:13.483 --> 18:15.355
Phoebe?

18:15.529 --> 18:17.531
Phoebe, we talked
about this.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.185
You blow it
with Cosmoonce,

18:19.359 --> 18:20.490
you don't get
a second chance.

18:20.664 --> 18:21.578
What is the matter with her?

18:21.752 --> 18:23.014
Well, um...

18:23.189 --> 18:25.495
I'd say that she's got
food poisoning.

18:25.669 --> 18:27.236
Food poisoning?Shh!

18:27.410 --> 18:29.151
I think the more she can sleep,

18:29.325 --> 18:30.326
the quicker she'll get better.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.067
When? When, when
is she gonna

18:32.241 --> 18:34.591
get better?Well, like I was trying to say,

18:34.765 --> 18:37.594
uh... a couple hours.

18:38.465 --> 18:39.379
Have you thought

18:39.553 --> 18:42.512
about doing it
at the office?

18:42.686 --> 18:44.688
Well, that is where I

18:44.862 --> 18:46.690
originally wanted
it, but...

18:46.864 --> 18:48.431
See? You're brilliant.

18:48.605 --> 18:50.259
Really a brilliant woman.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.782
Okay, I promise
I will have her there.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.567
She'd better be.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.926
Hi.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.232
How was the vacation?

19:06.406 --> 19:07.668
PIPER:
This better be
an emergency.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.757
We were just about to go
for a gondola ride.

19:15.850 --> 19:18.157
Per l'amor di Dio.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.290
Huh?Oh, "for the love of God".

19:26.556 --> 19:27.862
[cabaret piano music playing]

19:29.690 --> 19:30.995
Hey, a fan dance.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.519
I love a fan dance.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.955
Wait till you see this.

19:34.129 --> 19:35.435
You'll... Never mind.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.872
Yes, it is
quite a sight.

19:38.046 --> 19:39.308
A beautiful woman
on the stage,

19:39.482 --> 19:40.831
nothing between her
and the audience

19:41.005 --> 19:42.572
except two ostrich plume fans.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.705
The allure of
the dance is

19:44.879 --> 19:46.620
to watch how she moves
with the fans.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.275
Showing only what she wants,
not an inch more.

19:49.449 --> 19:51.625
Is the dance ever
performed by a man?

19:54.018 --> 19:55.759
So tell me, my new friends,

19:55.933 --> 19:57.500
how exactly do you know George?

19:57.674 --> 20:00.024
BOTH:
What makes you think that we do?

20:01.243 --> 20:03.289
Well, I saw you talking
to his fiancée, Marie.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.900
She seems terribly distraught,
doesn't she?

20:06.074 --> 20:07.031
She doesn't know
what happened to him.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.251
Do you?
I've been

20:09.425 --> 20:11.427
concerned about him recently.

20:11.601 --> 20:12.994
Keeping an eye on him, you know.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.693
He is my best barkeep,
after all.

20:16.867 --> 20:17.781
And you don't know
what happened?

20:17.955 --> 20:19.740
I wish I did.

20:22.264 --> 20:24.527
So, how did you come to learn
about the Cabaret Fantome?

20:24.701 --> 20:27.617
Oh... word gets out.

20:27.791 --> 20:28.923
Hard to keep a place

20:29.097 --> 20:30.490
like this hidden forever.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.015
Do you like the cigar?

20:34.189 --> 20:35.538
Quite.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.366
They're hand rolled in Havana

20:37.540 --> 20:39.847
and shipped to my dealer,
Philippe, special.

20:40.021 --> 20:41.588
He's right across
the street actually.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.154
Would you like

20:43.329 --> 20:44.373
to take in the night air,
pay him a visit?

20:44.547 --> 20:46.593
He loves new customers.Sure.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.899
Care to join us?

20:49.073 --> 20:52.555
Sadly, I'm unable
to leave the club.

20:52.729 --> 20:53.774
And why is that?

20:53.948 --> 20:55.819
Because as they say...

20:56.994 --> 20:59.736
...the show must go on, right?

21:01.434 --> 21:02.957
PIANO PLAYER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:03.131 --> 21:04.524
please welcome your host,

21:04.698 --> 21:07.309
Count Roget.[applause]

21:07.483 --> 21:09.920
Feel free to enjoy
the show from here.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.922
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
experience.

21:12.096 --> 21:13.794
We're dying to see it.

21:13.968 --> 21:16.187
["When the Saints Go
Marching In" plays on piano]

21:26.197 --> 21:28.374
[glass breaking, crowd screams]

21:34.031 --> 21:36.425
Right on time.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.035
[screaming in terror]

21:44.955 --> 21:46.479
He could have waited
till after the show.

21:46.653 --> 21:47.871
Come on, we've got to get
to the spot.

22:00.101 --> 22:02.103
[glass breaking, fire roaring,
crowd screaming]

22:08.370 --> 22:11.199
MARIE:
George!

22:11.373 --> 22:12.243
George!

22:12.418 --> 22:13.941
We have to help her.

22:14.115 --> 22:16.422
George, where are you?

22:16.596 --> 22:17.771
Look, we can't,
we stay,

22:17.945 --> 22:19.250
we burn just like
everyone else.

22:19.425 --> 22:19.947
Don't worry, she'll
be back tomorrow.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.037
Ahh... the fire.

22:24.430 --> 22:26.257
What's wrong?
What's going on?

22:26.432 --> 22:27.694
Go... go get some help.Right away.

22:36.746 --> 22:38.313
Marie!

22:42.622 --> 22:44.667
Just hold on.

22:44.841 --> 22:47.714
[clamoring]

23:02.772 --> 23:04.121
All right, well,
there's nothing in the Book

23:04.295 --> 23:05.471
that tells us
how to get them back, so...

23:05.645 --> 23:08.299
Since I can't talk
to the Elders...

23:13.043 --> 23:13.653
Phoebe?

23:15.132 --> 23:15.785
Are you all right?

23:18.135 --> 23:19.354
I don't know.

23:25.447 --> 23:27.318
PHOEBE:  Then that's when the good souls

23:27.493 --> 23:28.885
tried to escape
but couldn't.

23:29.059 --> 23:29.843
Couldn't?

23:30.017 --> 23:31.105
Yeah, all the exits

23:31.279 --> 23:32.323
were magically sealed.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.412
I got a dead leg.

23:33.586 --> 23:35.283
I'll be down
here. Sorry.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.937
Well, at least nobody knows
they're going to re-live it.

23:37.111 --> 23:38.286
Oh, the Count definitely knew.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.418
And he just
stood there,

23:39.592 --> 23:40.462
watching everybody burn.

23:40.636 --> 23:41.942
You think he's a demon?

23:42.116 --> 23:44.074
No, if he was,
he wouldn't be reliving it.

23:44.248 --> 23:46.381
No, but maybe he made
a deal with a demon.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.035
I mean, if he's
the one bad soul

23:48.209 --> 23:49.558
who's trying
to hold everyone back,

23:49.732 --> 23:51.212
I mean, he'd do anything
to keep from moving on.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.606
Doesn't seem like
much of a deal, though.

23:53.780 --> 23:55.216
He's stuck as well.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.522
Yeah, but I mean, it's
better than Purgatory.

23:56.696 --> 23:58.088
Trust me, it's...

23:58.262 --> 24:00.395
Besides, he's probably
trying to buy time.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.092
You know, find another way out.

24:02.266 --> 24:03.746
PHOEBE:
Okay, so how

24:03.920 --> 24:05.705
do we help George
and the other souls move on?

24:05.879 --> 24:07.184
Well, first, you
got to find a way

24:07.358 --> 24:08.229
to separate their souls
from the Count's.

24:08.403 --> 24:09.752
Yeah, but how?

24:09.926 --> 24:11.145
You find whomever
he made the deal with

24:11.319 --> 24:12.625
and get him to break it.

24:12.799 --> 24:13.756
You think
that demon's still around?

24:13.930 --> 24:14.670
Well, this one is.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.542
Yeah, but not for long.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.239
And besides, that's

24:18.413 --> 24:19.414
not really the point.

24:19.588 --> 24:20.328
I mean, enough
about me.

24:20.502 --> 24:21.895
What do you think of me?

24:22.069 --> 24:23.113
Let's

24:23.287 --> 24:25.246
go check the Book. Andiamo!

24:25.420 --> 24:26.769
Ciao, ciao.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.424
So maybe we should
go talk to George

24:29.598 --> 24:31.861
and see if he remembers
what the demon looks like.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.820
Hello. Hello.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.083
Magazine, interview.
Cosmo, canceling twice.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.650
Well, I think this is

24:37.824 --> 24:39.086
a little bit more important
than Cosmo, don't you?

24:39.260 --> 24:40.566
Paige,

24:40.740 --> 24:42.481
there's a lot more
to life than work.

24:42.655 --> 24:44.744
There's adventure.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.397
Really? I wouldn't know.

24:46.572 --> 24:47.747
Hey, I have
an idea.

24:47.921 --> 24:48.748
Why don't you do it?

24:48.922 --> 24:49.749
What?

24:49.923 --> 24:51.402
Be me. You can glamour,

24:51.577 --> 24:52.752
you've done
it before.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.231
Paige, it'll give you
a little taste

24:54.405 --> 24:55.668
of life outside Magic School,

24:55.842 --> 24:57.365
and besides, if
anyone knows me

24:57.539 --> 24:59.715
as well as I know me...
it's you. Just fake it.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.935
Why don't I just
go talk to George?

25:02.109 --> 25:03.806
Because if we
have to go back

25:03.980 --> 25:05.155
to the cabaret
afterwards,

25:05.329 --> 25:06.679
the Count, is
expecting Phoebe.

25:06.853 --> 25:08.681
Feathers and all.

25:08.855 --> 25:09.769
Feathers?

25:09.943 --> 25:11.379
Don't ask.

25:16.689 --> 25:18.168
The doctors are
saying that

25:18.342 --> 25:20.127
he's schizophrenic
or something.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.259
First he's George,
then he's back to
being Mike again

25:22.433 --> 25:23.652
and-and now
he's George.

25:23.826 --> 25:25.262
That must be
who we saw get back

25:25.436 --> 25:26.873
into the club
before we left.

25:27.047 --> 25:28.570
And perhaps the
fire starting

25:28.744 --> 25:29.745
is what pulled
George's soul

25:29.919 --> 25:31.268
back into
the time warp.

25:31.442 --> 25:32.705
Which means he knows
what's really going on.

25:32.879 --> 25:33.793
And can only escape

25:33.967 --> 25:34.881
long enough to
cry for help.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.360
What are you two talking about?

25:36.535 --> 25:37.666
The fire that your friend
is screaming about,

25:37.840 --> 25:39.625
Darryl, is real.
Very real.

25:39.799 --> 25:41.801
Oh, the fire!
Let me get out of here!

25:41.975 --> 25:43.280
That's how poor George died.

25:43.454 --> 25:44.978
Please, somebody, please!
Let me out!

25:45.152 --> 25:46.457
And the only way he knows
how to cry out for help

25:46.632 --> 25:47.502
is to possess your friend.

25:47.676 --> 25:49.112
But why? Why Mike?

25:49.939 --> 25:50.592
Proximity.

25:50.766 --> 25:51.941
Help!

25:52.115 --> 25:54.204
I need to get
out of here!

25:54.378 --> 25:55.597
You ready?
No.

25:55.771 --> 25:56.772
Let's go.
Okay.

25:56.946 --> 25:58.339
Ahhhh!

25:58.513 --> 26:01.255
I got to...
I got to get out of the fire!

26:01.429 --> 26:03.953
It's coming back. Oh...

26:04.127 --> 26:05.825
I need somebody to believe me.

26:05.999 --> 26:08.349
We believe you.
We believe you, George.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.919
George?

26:14.790 --> 26:17.401
Then you do believe me?

26:17.576 --> 26:18.620
Yes.

26:19.534 --> 26:22.711
We also saw Marie
just as we left.

26:22.885 --> 26:25.235
Well, you...

26:25.409 --> 26:27.977
You can go in and out
without getting burned?

26:28.151 --> 26:29.326
How?

26:29.500 --> 26:32.503
Well, you kind of have
to die first...

26:32.678 --> 26:33.853
And we can go back in

26:34.027 --> 26:35.245
to free you and
everybody else.

26:35.419 --> 26:36.682
But we're going
to need your help.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.161
Anything. Any...
anything, anything.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.728
Okay, what can you
tell us about the Count?

26:39.902 --> 26:41.904
He's the one who did this.

26:42.078 --> 26:43.906
He cursed everybody.

26:44.080 --> 26:45.386
To save himself.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.561
Yeah, we know.

26:46.735 --> 26:48.650
Maybe he
was talking

26:48.824 --> 26:49.912
to someone else,
maybe there's...

26:50.086 --> 26:51.914
Did you see him talk
to anybody else,

26:52.088 --> 26:53.176
anyone unusual
that night?

26:53.350 --> 26:54.482
Yes, yes!

26:54.656 --> 26:56.310
Every night before

26:56.484 --> 26:59.269
the show, he sits with this
frightening-looking man...

26:59.443 --> 27:01.054
at the center table.

27:01.228 --> 27:04.753
And then the Count,
he signs something.

27:04.927 --> 27:06.059
That could be the deal.

27:06.233 --> 27:07.016
And they might
still be there.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.452
Let's go. Um...

27:08.627 --> 27:10.846
this may be a
silly question.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.109
Is there anything we can do
to make you more comfortable?

27:13.283 --> 27:15.329
Save Marie.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.735
Kids are down
for the count.

27:29.909 --> 27:31.258
No pun intended.

27:31.432 --> 27:32.389
What are you doing?

27:32.563 --> 27:33.782
Me? Uh, nothing.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.566
Yes, you are.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.743
You're writing
in the Book?

27:37.917 --> 27:39.222
No, I was just
looking for demons.

27:39.396 --> 27:42.573
"Tips for Future
Whitelighters"?

27:42.748 --> 27:45.315
What...?

27:45.489 --> 27:46.969
It's just something

27:47.143 --> 27:48.405
I was working out
for the kids,

27:48.579 --> 27:49.406
you know.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.192
No. I don't know.

27:52.366 --> 27:54.281
Why can't you just
tell them all this

27:54.455 --> 27:55.674
yourself when they're ready?

27:55.848 --> 27:58.285
Oh, because I might
not be around.

27:58.459 --> 28:00.461
Oh come on.
Look, Piper,
I know you want

28:00.635 --> 28:01.941
I know you want
to ignore everything

28:02.115 --> 28:03.159
that's going on
with the Elders,

28:03.333 --> 28:04.683
but I can't.
We don't know

28:04.857 --> 28:06.249
what they're going
to do to me, or when.

28:06.423 --> 28:08.948
Well, they can't just yank
you out of our lives, Leo.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.385
How do you know that?Because they can't.

28:11.559 --> 28:14.431
And if they did,
I'd quit, we'd all quit.

28:15.606 --> 28:17.043
Is that why you didn't want

28:17.217 --> 28:19.045
to go around the world
in 80 orbs?

28:19.219 --> 28:22.091
Yeah, I just wanted to
finish it, just in case.

28:22.265 --> 28:24.703
Okay.

28:24.877 --> 28:27.531
Did you even
look for demons?

28:27.706 --> 28:30.926
Yeah, I found this one.

28:31.100 --> 28:34.930
"Sargon, traders of souls,
preys on the afterlife."

28:35.104 --> 28:37.063
Well, it certainly
looks like our guy.

28:37.237 --> 28:38.847
Except...

28:39.021 --> 28:41.415
we vanquished him already.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.943
I can do this.

28:48.117 --> 28:50.903
I can do this. I can do this.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.166
You owe me.

28:54.689 --> 28:56.082
[sighs]

28:56.256 --> 28:58.954
Hello, sis.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.526
Phoebe.

29:05.700 --> 29:07.006
There you are.
You look great.

29:07.180 --> 29:08.485
You feeling better?

29:08.659 --> 29:09.748
[whispering]:
You are so late.
I know.

29:09.922 --> 29:10.749
Maybe we should
just reschedule.

29:10.923 --> 29:11.837
Oh, not a chance.

29:12.011 --> 29:13.795
Um, come meet
everybody.

29:13.969 --> 29:15.362
Hi, I'm Cameron.

29:15.536 --> 29:16.929
Hi, it's nice
to meet you.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.582
So you're the
photographer?

29:18.757 --> 29:21.281
Uh, I'm interviewing you.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.370
We spoke on the phone?
Twice?

29:23.544 --> 29:25.938
Oh, that's right.
I'm sorry.

29:26.112 --> 29:27.809
I got confused,
I thought you said,

29:27.983 --> 29:29.289
"I'm the camera man."

29:29.463 --> 29:30.681
Get it, "Cameron"?

29:30.856 --> 29:32.379
Okay, so, um, I'm just

29:32.553 --> 29:33.815
going to ask
you questions

29:33.989 --> 29:35.382
while they shoot,
is that all right

29:35.556 --> 29:36.775
with you?
Okay, great.Sure. Shoot away.

29:37.471 --> 29:39.081
Oh!

29:39.255 --> 29:40.430
Are you all right?

29:40.604 --> 29:43.564
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just new contacts.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.435
So, why don't
we start with

29:45.609 --> 29:47.481
what inspired you

29:47.655 --> 29:49.613
to become an
advice columnist?

29:49.788 --> 29:53.226
That's a really good question.

29:53.400 --> 29:54.749
Well,

29:54.923 --> 29:57.273
I guess, uh, growing up
as an only child--

29:57.447 --> 29:59.275
I'm sorry.
Only child?

29:59.449 --> 30:02.844
I meant Paige grew up
as an only child,

30:03.018 --> 30:06.761
I mean that's how she grew up
until she met her sisters--

30:06.935 --> 30:08.284
you know, us... me.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.938
And that had

30:10.112 --> 30:11.461
absolutely nothing to do

30:11.635 --> 30:14.551
with why Phoebe
became an advice columnist.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.379
[chuckling]

30:16.553 --> 30:19.426
She talks about herself in
the third person.
[weak laugh]

30:19.600 --> 30:20.688
Yeah, what I meant to say--

30:20.862 --> 30:22.342
was that, um...

30:22.516 --> 30:26.172
Paige really had a lot to do
with my decision.

30:26.346 --> 30:27.086
Mm-hmm.

30:27.260 --> 30:28.174
Well, she opened up

30:28.348 --> 30:30.350
a whole new world for me and

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
made me see how much
I really have to offer.

30:32.874 --> 30:34.180
And I can

30:34.354 --> 30:35.659
honestly say

30:35.834 --> 30:37.705
that I would not be standing
here today

30:37.879 --> 30:39.576
if it wasn't for Paige.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.665
Oh, great.

30:44.103 --> 30:45.234
Hi!

30:45.408 --> 30:46.409
Okay,

30:46.583 --> 30:47.454
according to Mike...

30:47.628 --> 30:48.585
George.
Whatever,

30:48.759 --> 30:49.935
there was in fact

30:50.109 --> 30:51.066
a demon in the club
that night

30:51.240 --> 30:52.067
who...
We vanquished

30:52.241 --> 30:53.416
five years ago.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.854
What? Are
you serious?
Afraid so.

30:56.028 --> 30:57.420
LEO:
And according to

30:57.594 --> 30:59.031
the book, there
aren't any other

30:59.205 --> 31:00.467
demons who could have
made the deal either.

31:00.641 --> 31:01.729
Well, how do we get
them to unmake it?

31:01.903 --> 31:02.730
We go back.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.601
No. What? No.
No,

31:04.775 --> 31:06.125
I think he's right.
It's the only way

31:06.299 --> 31:07.561
we're going to be able
to find the demon.

31:07.735 --> 31:09.084
But you said yourself,
you'd barely made it out

31:09.258 --> 31:10.520
of there alive
last time; besides,

31:10.694 --> 31:12.131
you don't even know
what he looks like.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.959
Well, George told us
where to find him.

31:14.133 --> 31:15.830
Well, it's simple.

31:16.004 --> 31:18.833
We go back, I talk to him--
demon to demon, talon to talon,

31:19.007 --> 31:20.095
claw to claw--

31:20.269 --> 31:21.749
make him unmake the deal.

31:21.923 --> 31:22.706
And then hopefully the
souls will be released.

31:22.881 --> 31:23.751
Yeah.
Okay.

31:23.925 --> 31:25.666
Let's do it.

31:27.755 --> 31:29.148
But this time
no messing around,

31:29.322 --> 31:30.714
okay? We get in, we
find him, we get out.

31:30.889 --> 31:31.933
Yeah, well, let's stay
for the show this time.

31:32.107 --> 31:33.021
Wait!

31:33.195 --> 31:35.110
What are we
supposed to do?

31:35.284 --> 31:36.895
What you always
do... worry.

31:39.593 --> 31:41.377
[cabaret music playing]

31:41.551 --> 31:43.510
We're late.

31:44.598 --> 31:45.425
Um, no, we're not.

31:45.599 --> 31:46.556
Let's go, let's go.

31:46.730 --> 31:47.993
PHOEBE:
There's nobody

31:48.167 --> 31:49.472
at that center table.

31:49.646 --> 31:51.431
ROGET:
Oh, your demon
is long gone.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.085
In fact, he left

31:53.259 --> 31:55.914
106 years ago,
right after we made the deal,

31:56.088 --> 31:57.089
long before the fire.

31:57.263 --> 31:58.133
[George's voice]:
You know...

31:58.307 --> 31:59.613
the fire!

31:59.787 --> 32:01.310
It's coming back.
You got to believe me!

32:01.484 --> 32:02.921
Sit down.[gun cocking]

32:03.095 --> 32:04.661
Please, you got to
help me and Marie!

32:04.835 --> 32:06.707
[own voice]:
Or something like that.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.363
Oh, my God,

32:10.537 --> 32:11.930
that was you in Mike's body,
you tricked us.

32:12.104 --> 32:13.801
Slow down.

32:13.975 --> 32:15.585
PIANO PLAYER:
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your host

32:15.759 --> 32:18.153
Count Roget.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.589
[dance music playing]

32:19.763 --> 32:21.243
I regret to inform you

32:21.417 --> 32:25.944
that tonight's fan dance
is going to be canceled.

32:26.118 --> 32:27.423
[gun cocking]

32:28.381 --> 32:30.557
[crowd screaming]

32:40.219 --> 32:42.656
[screaming]

32:44.092 --> 32:45.006
You really think
that gun's going to do

32:45.180 --> 32:46.355
anything?
Indeed.

32:46.529 --> 32:48.488
If you can burn...
you can bleed.

32:52.709 --> 32:53.841
You really shouldn't bother.

32:55.538 --> 32:56.887
Both of you
will die soon enough.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.542
Since your friend George

32:59.716 --> 33:01.370
has found a temporary way out,

33:01.544 --> 33:04.983
I now have found
my permanent way out.

33:08.073 --> 33:09.770
[people screaming]

33:09.944 --> 33:12.033
[groaning]

33:14.514 --> 33:16.516
You know, they haven't been gone
that long. Relax.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.997
Oh, no, I can't relax.

33:19.171 --> 33:21.651
I worry, remember?

33:24.567 --> 33:26.091
Drake...

33:27.483 --> 33:28.702
...what happened?

33:29.833 --> 33:32.271
Why isn't Phoebe waking up?

33:32.445 --> 33:35.752
Drake, did you hear me?

33:35.926 --> 33:37.537
What the hell's wrong
with Phoebe?

33:39.843 --> 33:42.107
I-I suppose she didn't make it.

33:53.857 --> 33:56.077
PIPER:
What do you mean
she didn't make it?

33:56.251 --> 33:57.905
How is that
possible?I don't know.

33:58.079 --> 33:59.167
[groans]

33:59.341 --> 34:01.082
Clumsy sod.

34:01.256 --> 34:03.780
What's the
matter with you?

34:03.954 --> 34:05.478
Nothing.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.914
Actually, I'm splendid.

34:07.871 --> 34:09.786
I mean... swell.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.788
Look, you have to go back and
get her before the fire starts.

34:11.962 --> 34:13.964
Oh, it's already begun.[helicopter whirring]

34:14.139 --> 34:16.054
Well, then you need
to go get her. Go!

34:16.228 --> 34:16.837
No!

34:17.011 --> 34:18.447
What do you mean?

34:18.621 --> 34:19.231
Go back there?[helicopter whirring overhead]

34:19.405 --> 34:20.406
Forget it.

34:20.580 --> 34:21.146
Why not?

34:21.320 --> 34:24.453
[loud whirring]

34:24.627 --> 34:25.411
DRAKE:
Perhaps if

34:25.585 --> 34:27.369
I go...

34:28.936 --> 34:30.764
outside...

34:30.938 --> 34:33.506
[chuckles]

34:34.768 --> 34:37.249
...have a smoke,
you know, like, uh...

34:37.423 --> 34:40.252
consider the possibility
of... going back.

34:40.426 --> 34:41.557
I got to...

34:41.731 --> 34:42.776
Excuse me.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.386
Who are you?

34:44.560 --> 34:46.258
Count Roget.

34:50.436 --> 34:51.698
Oh, not bad.

34:51.872 --> 34:53.395
I guess I did choose
the right body.

34:53.569 --> 34:54.527
[chuckles]

34:54.701 --> 34:56.181
No.

34:56.355 --> 34:58.313
Don't. You're in enough trouble
already with the...

34:58.487 --> 35:00.881
the Elders.

35:01.055 --> 35:03.840
[people screaming]

35:04.014 --> 35:05.625
[glass shattering]

35:10.543 --> 35:11.848
Phoebe, go. Go on.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.502
I'm gonna die anyway.
Get out of here!

35:13.676 --> 35:15.025
Not like this.

35:15.200 --> 35:16.505
Look, if George can get out,
we can, too.

35:16.679 --> 35:17.941
We just... We just have
to think about this.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.378
We have to
think about it...

35:21.554 --> 35:24.339
Fortune-teller.
Okay.

35:24.513 --> 35:27.299
[people clamoring,
glass breaking]

35:27.473 --> 35:29.736
Perfect, perfect.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.522
Uh, five card spread. One...

35:36.221 --> 35:37.613
Listen, the odds are,
the Count--

35:37.787 --> 35:39.137
he's possessed my body, right?

35:39.311 --> 35:41.269
And until he's evicted,
I got nowhere to go.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.402
Only you can get out
into your body.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.839
Even though I'm into your
body, I still can't get out.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.493
I'll come back for you.

35:47.667 --> 35:49.103
And listen, if he puts up
too big of a fight,

35:49.277 --> 35:50.670
all right,
you just vanquish my sorry ass!

35:50.844 --> 35:52.193
I don't care.
Okay.

But only as
a last resort.Okay.

[coughing]

35:58.939 --> 36:00.593
Can I get a water?

36:03.509 --> 36:05.250
This should dispossess him if

36:05.424 --> 36:06.599
we can find him.

36:06.773 --> 36:08.340
Well, he's off the radar,

36:08.514 --> 36:10.777
and there's nothing in The Book
to help locate him.

36:10.951 --> 36:13.258
You were onto something
a minute ago.

36:13.432 --> 36:14.389
[loud gasp]

36:14.563 --> 36:15.608
Phoebe?

36:15.782 --> 36:17.349
Where's the Count?

36:17.523 --> 36:19.481
Wait a minute.

36:19.655 --> 36:21.091
What's my
middle name?

36:21.266 --> 36:23.093
Uh... Surly?

36:23.268 --> 36:25.052
Ha! That's my girl.

36:25.226 --> 36:26.445
Whatever. Where's Drake's body?

36:26.619 --> 36:28.664
We don't know.

36:28.838 --> 36:29.970

We

36:30.144 --> 36:31.363
can't scry for him.

36:31.537 --> 36:33.234
But we're thinking
maybe he's in a pub,

36:33.408 --> 36:34.409
or a restaurant.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.802
Or a tobacco shop.

36:36.759 --> 36:38.979
I think I know
where to find him.

38:08.242 --> 38:09.417
Thank you.

38:09.591 --> 38:10.679
[slight grunt]

38:10.853 --> 38:12.899
[grunting]

38:13.073 --> 38:14.335
Thank you so much.

38:14.509 --> 38:15.771
[laughs]
Thank you
for bringing me back.

38:15.945 --> 38:17.207
Thank you.
[sighs]

38:17.382 --> 38:18.774
This boy was getting hot.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.776
I'll bet.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.362
[loud, indistinct
chatter and shouting]

38:41.536 --> 38:42.842
MAN:
...over here!

38:43.016 --> 38:44.365
[Piper laughing]

38:44.539 --> 38:49.936
"Spiacente il mio amore non e a Roma."

38:50.110 --> 38:53.243
Leonardo, it's bene.

38:53.418 --> 38:55.333
[laughs]

38:55.507 --> 38:57.378
Vacation was a great idea.

38:57.552 --> 39:00.381
Just not great timing.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.818
Yeah, well,
life is short, bella.

39:02.992 --> 39:04.603
Are you quoting Drake now?

39:04.777 --> 39:06.169
He's got a point.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.954
Thanks for trying
to distract me from the Elders.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.131
I just wish it'd worked
out the way I planned.

39:11.305 --> 39:12.611
Could be worse.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.830
I think from now on,

39:15.004 --> 39:18.268
I'm gonna stop trying
to control every little moment.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.360
The best ones kind of
sneak up on you anyhow.

39:31.847 --> 39:33.806
Excuse me,
have you seen Phoebe?

39:33.980 --> 39:35.373
Very funny.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.331
Wow. Just saying,

39:37.505 --> 39:39.899
I haven't seen you
this relaxed in, uh,
quite a long time.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.467
After having been you,
I kind of see why.

39:42.641 --> 39:44.730
Well, I'm trying
to take a step back

39:44.904 --> 39:46.427
and enjoy every moment.

39:46.601 --> 39:47.863
Hey, thank you.

39:48.037 --> 39:49.343
You did a great job.

39:49.517 --> 39:50.605
Nobody ever knew.

39:50.779 --> 39:52.520
Well, you're welcome.

39:52.694 --> 39:55.958
Uh, and I think
after reading the
article, you'll find

39:56.132 --> 39:58.439
that your little sister
got praised quite a bit.

39:58.613 --> 40:00.267
Deservedly so.

40:00.441 --> 40:03.009
I actually think I got more out
of it than you did.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.142
Yeah.I kind of miss being out there
in the real world, you know?

40:06.316 --> 40:08.406
Well, maybe you should
do something about that.

40:08.580 --> 40:10.625
Maybe I will.

40:10.799 --> 40:13.498
MAN [over microphone]:

40:13.672 --> 40:16.762

What's going on?

40:18.851 --> 40:20.113
...Drake Demond.

40:20.287 --> 40:21.897
[applause]Oh, my God.

40:22.071 --> 40:24.639
This is what happens when
you have one week to live?

40:24.813 --> 40:26.772
What is he up to?

40:26.946 --> 40:29.339
Just be grateful
it's not a fan dance.
