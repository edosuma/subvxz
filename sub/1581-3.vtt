So, we're not
selling the droids,

13:59.209 --> 14:01.576
But we're selling the t-7s?

14:01.578 --> 14:03.911
We don't even know
who vizago's buyer is.

14:03.913 --> 14:07.582
We know it's not the empire,
and i already made
a deal with vizago.

14:07.584 --> 14:10.284
So let's get these crates
off the boat.

14:14.391 --> 14:19.293
Sir, a distress call
to governor pryce has been
rerouted to your attention.

14:22.932 --> 14:27.201
<i>This is c-3po,</i>
<i>human-cyborg relations.</i>

14:27.203 --> 14:30.672
My counterpart and i
were abducted from the spaceport
on garel by criminals.

14:30.674 --> 14:32.707
Thieves! Outlaws!

14:32.709 --> 14:37.612
<i>[ kallus ]</i>
<i>remain calm, my friend.</i>
<i>All i need is your location.</i>

14:37.614 --> 14:40.581
<i>Sending our coordinates now.</i>

14:40.583 --> 14:43.451
Have no fear.
Help is on the way.

14:50.927 --> 14:55.730
Oh. I can make
some beautiful music
with these.

14:55.732 --> 14:58.366
They're not
that kind of instruments!

14:58.368 --> 15:01.636
Ah. You just have to know
how to play them.

15:01.638 --> 15:03.971
And how to play
those who want to buy them.

15:03.973 --> 15:06.741
You have to buy them
from us first.

15:06.743 --> 15:11.312
Finally. Someone on your crew
who understands business.

15:12.315 --> 15:14.382
Let's just get this
over with.

15:14.384 --> 15:16.284
[ starship approaches ]

15:19.556 --> 15:20.988
What is this?

15:20.990 --> 15:23.725
You were followed!
That's not possible.

15:23.727 --> 15:25.493
Tell it to the empire!

15:26.596 --> 15:28.429
Leave the rest.
We're gone!

15:28.965 --> 15:30.732
You haven't paid us.

15:30.734 --> 15:33.501
Cikatro vizago
doesn't pay for half a shipment.

15:33.503 --> 15:36.604
And he doesn't pay
for trouble with imperials.

15:36.606 --> 15:40.508
My friends, i hope you live
to bargain another day.

15:40.944 --> 15:43.478
And if you don't-- eh.

15:52.288 --> 15:53.654
Shouldn't
we be going too?

15:53.656 --> 15:56.390
We can't let these disruptors
fall into imperial hands.

15:56.392 --> 15:57.992
Sabine, destroy the guns.

15:57.994 --> 16:01.362
Ha. Now you're
speaking my language.
I'll go get my gear.

16:01.364 --> 16:03.898
R2-d2, stop!
What are you doing?

16:03.900 --> 16:06.901
[ beeping ]
joining the crew?

16:06.903 --> 16:09.003
[ beeping continues ]

16:10.840 --> 16:14.542
Of course.
Overload the disruptors,
and boom!

16:14.544 --> 16:17.645
Good call, little guy.
You can join our crew anytime.

16:17.647 --> 16:19.647
Well, short my circuits.

16:19.649 --> 16:21.616
Hera, help sabine
open the crates.

16:21.618 --> 16:23.050
Zeb, ezra, line 'em up.

16:23.052 --> 16:25.720
Meanwhile,
i'll deal with the walkers.

17:05.829 --> 17:08.061
Advance and fire.

17:09.531 --> 17:11.566
Thank you. Thank you.

17:11.568 --> 17:13.667
I knew some form
of rescue would arrive.

17:13.670 --> 17:16.369
I told r2, but he thinks
so ill of stormtroopers.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.807
Wait! Don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

17:20.810 --> 17:23.344
You're here
to rescue me!

17:23.346 --> 17:25.646
[ hera ]
chopper, ready the ship
for takeoff!

17:31.688 --> 17:33.821
You! Lasat!

17:35.625 --> 17:36.791
Face me!

17:41.564 --> 17:42.630
Wait!
Zeb!

17:42.632 --> 17:45.366
[ both shouting ]

17:50.673 --> 17:54.442
Only the honor guard of lasan
may carry a bo-rifle!

17:54.444 --> 17:55.877
I know.
[ cackles ]

17:55.879 --> 17:58.746
I removed it
from a guardsman myself.

18:00.783 --> 18:03.017
I was there
when lasan fell.

18:03.019 --> 18:05.820
I know why
you fear those disruptors.

18:05.822 --> 18:08.556
I gave the order
to use them.

18:20.703 --> 18:22.503
[ groans ]

18:27.477 --> 18:30.111
That fool lasat's
gonna get himself killed.

18:34.751 --> 18:36.417
Okay. We're ready.

18:41.624 --> 18:43.424
Everyone, push!

18:48.998 --> 18:50.698
[ rapid beeping ]

18:51.768 --> 18:53.701
[ beeping rising in pitch ]

19:08.751 --> 19:09.951
No!

19:21.764 --> 19:24.231
Spectre-2,
get the kid aboard.

19:24.233 --> 19:25.933
Right.

19:28.805 --> 19:30.871
Move, all of you, now!

19:31.541 --> 19:33.174
Zeb! Come on, big guy.

19:33.176 --> 19:35.242
We gotta get out of here.
Zeb?

19:40.249 --> 19:42.616
Will our torment
never end?

19:44.787 --> 19:46.754
Chopper, get us out of here.

19:56.065 --> 19:57.665
Will he be okay?

19:57.667 --> 19:59.734
[ groaning ]

20:00.670 --> 20:01.836
Yeah.

20:04.273 --> 20:06.040
Thanks, mate.

20:06.042 --> 20:07.942
Appreciate the save.

20:07.944 --> 20:09.710
Wasn't me.

20:10.713 --> 20:12.179
It was ezra.

20:19.822 --> 20:23.824
And, ezra,
your formal jedi training
starts tomorrow.

20:28.631 --> 20:30.131
[ whistles, beeps ]

20:44.113 --> 20:47.615
That's very generous, sir.
Well, i'm very fond
of these droids.

20:47.617 --> 20:48.983
Then i'm glad
we could return them.

20:48.985 --> 20:51.218
The simplest
gesture of kindness...

20:51.220 --> 20:53.020
Can fill a galaxy
with hope.

20:53.022 --> 20:55.756
Isn't that... A jedi saying?

20:55.758 --> 20:57.558
Safe travels, my friend.

20:59.662 --> 21:01.095
Safe travels.

21:03.666 --> 21:05.766
You didn't tell them my name.

21:05.768 --> 21:07.868
Of course i didn't,
senator organa.

21:07.870 --> 21:12.840
But this entire ordeal
has rather stressed
every one of my circuits.

21:12.842 --> 21:14.875
Permission to shut down?

21:14.877 --> 21:16.677
Granted.

21:16.679 --> 21:18.279
You recorded everything,
old friend?

21:18.281 --> 21:20.047
[ beeps, whistles ]

21:20.049 --> 21:22.850
Good. We'll focus
on the imperials later.

21:22.852 --> 21:27.254
For now, show me
what you have
on your rebels.
