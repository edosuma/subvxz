<i>NARRATOR:</i> <i>Kids, one morning in
2010,</i> <i>I opened the newspaper</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:05.638
<i>only to discover an op-ed</i>
<i>written by Zoey Pierson.</i>

00:06.483 --> 00:07.750
<i>You remember Zoey.</i>

00:07.751 --> 00:10.286
Key Ted Mosby's car.

00:10.287 --> 00:12.355
<i>In those four column inches,</i>
<i>she railed against me</i>

00:12.356 --> 00:13.706
<i>and my company, GNB,</i>

00:13.707 --> 00:16.692
<i>for wanting to tear down</i>
<i>a beautiful old building:</i>

00:16.693 --> 00:17.793
<i>The Arcadian.</i>

00:17.794 --> 00:19.262
<i>And as if that</i>
<i>wasn't bad enough,</i>

00:19.263 --> 00:22.231
<i>the piece ran on a Saturday,</i>
<i>which as you both know,</i>

00:22.232 --> 00:24.333
<i>is Dad's crossword day.</i>

00:24.334 --> 00:26.569
She ruined crossword day!

00:26.570 --> 00:27.904
I can't believe this.

00:27.905 --> 00:29.705
She singles me out by name.

00:29.706 --> 00:33.176
Calls me a "fat cat."
Me and my "fat-cat friends."

00:33.177 --> 00:34.577
We're not fat cats.

00:34.578 --> 00:35.845
Exactly.

00:35.846 --> 00:37.597
I say, Marshall, my good
man, how's my bow tie?

00:37.598 --> 00:38.881
Impeccable, old bean.

00:38.882 --> 00:41.234
To industry!
Ah, bully!

00:41.235 --> 00:44.754
<i>Okay, that night we
weren't</i> <i>entirely un-fat-catty.</i>

00:44.755 --> 00:47.073
<i>You see, every year</i>
<i>the Natural History Museum</i>

00:47.074 --> 00:48.941
<i>holds its Autumn Spectacular.</i>

00:48.942 --> 00:50.393
<i>It's attended</i>
<i>by some of the most powerful</i>

00:50.394 --> 00:52.662
<i>and important people</i>
<i>in New York.</i>

00:52.663 --> 00:55.031
<i>And, thanks to</i>
<i>Goliath National Bank...</i>

00:55.032 --> 00:56.232
<i>us.</i>

00:56.233 --> 00:57.767
Look at us, huh?

00:57.768 --> 00:58.968
In tuxedos?

00:58.969 --> 01:02.305
Can you imagine if our college
selves saw us like this?

01:02.306 --> 01:03.873
They'd pelt us
with their Phish bootlegs.

01:03.874 --> 01:07.910
Yeah, we were pretty
anti-establishment back then.

01:07.911 --> 01:09.545
Oh, God, remember Russell?

01:09.546 --> 01:10.880
Oh.

01:11.615 --> 01:14.217
Nice monkey suit, Russell.
Yeah.

01:14.218 --> 01:15.618
Come on, guys.

01:15.619 --> 01:17.553
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't hear you

01:17.554 --> 01:19.222
with that corporate noose
around your neck.

01:19.223 --> 01:22.024
And don't even try showing up
to the drum circle this weekend.

01:22.025 --> 01:23.226
Yeah.

01:25.028 --> 01:27.230
Oh, hey. You guys
seen Russell?

01:27.231 --> 01:28.931
I'm supposed to drive him
to his mom's funeral.

01:30.767 --> 01:32.668
I wish I knew
you guys back then.

01:32.669 --> 01:35.104
You know why? Because you
can't kick a story in the nuts.

01:35.105 --> 01:37.373
Hey, we're still those people.

01:37.374 --> 01:39.675
One of these days, Marshall's
going to quit his job

01:39.676 --> 01:41.210
and go to work for the NRDC,

01:41.211 --> 01:43.613
and save the world,
right, baby?

01:43.614 --> 01:45.381
Absotively.

01:45.382 --> 01:46.616
But let's just
remember, I mean,

01:46.617 --> 01:48.251
nobody's the same
as they were in college.

01:48.252 --> 01:50.653
You know, it's like, I wear
a suit to work every day.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.588
Well, yeah, but you
wear it ironically,

01:52.589 --> 01:54.323
like Ted's fanny pack.

01:54.324 --> 01:56.325
Next time we go
to Great Adventure,

01:56.326 --> 02:00.129
you're carrying
your own sunblock.

02:04.901 --> 02:07.103
Ooh! I love this exhibit.

02:07.104 --> 02:09.805
One time when I was a kid, this
room was closed for cleaning,

02:09.806 --> 02:11.374
so I snuck under the rope.

02:11.375 --> 02:12.408
Ooh.

02:12.409 --> 02:13.643
Wow, that's pretty cool.

02:13.644 --> 02:15.378
When I was a kid,
I knocked down the blue whale.

02:15.379 --> 02:18.314
Okay, the giant blue whale
hanging from the ceiling?

02:18.315 --> 02:20.666
I was six. My uncle Jerry
brought me here for the day.

02:20.667 --> 02:22.318
He said, "Don't touch anything""

02:22.319 --> 02:23.552
To a kid.

02:23.553 --> 02:25.388
That's like someone telling us,

02:25.389 --> 02:26.706
"Don't look at that girl's perky

02:26.707 --> 02:28.708
and impossibly symmetrical
knockers."

02:28.709 --> 02:29.825
Ooh.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.260
Not bad.

02:31.261 --> 02:34.864
So, naturally, I snapped
the rib off a triceratops,

02:34.865 --> 02:37.400
blahbity-blahbity-blue,
I knocked down the whale.

02:37.401 --> 02:39.502
I'm surprised security
didn't stop me on the way in.

02:39.503 --> 02:41.220
Well, I'm sure
they don't remember.

02:41.221 --> 02:43.055
I mean, it's been like 30 years

02:43.056 --> 02:45.174
since that completely
made-up story didn't happen.

02:45.175 --> 02:46.909
It happened.

02:46.910 --> 02:48.444
And these people don't forget.

02:48.445 --> 02:50.846
This is not the
Natural Stuff That Happened

02:50.847 --> 02:53.115
No More Than Five Minutes Ago
Museum. Huh?

02:53.116 --> 02:54.950
Marshall, Barney,
there you are.

02:54.951 --> 02:57.353
I want you to meet an old friend
of mine from Exeter,

02:57.354 --> 02:59.238
George Van Smoot.

02:59.239 --> 03:02.024
But you can, and should,
call me The Captain.

03:02.025 --> 03:03.959
The Captain?
The Captain?

03:03.960 --> 03:06.862
Back in school we met during
a production of <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

03:06.863 --> 03:12.034
The Captain was Nathan Detroit
to my assistant stage manager.

03:12.035 --> 03:14.036
Marshall and Barney here,

03:14.037 --> 03:16.205
are the future
of Goliath National Bank.

03:16.206 --> 03:17.640
Well, ahoy.

03:17.641 --> 03:19.942
Ahoy.
Ahoy, The Captain.

03:19.943 --> 03:21.677
The Captain pretty much paid
for this entire shindig.

03:21.678 --> 03:22.878
Please, enjoy yourselves,

03:22.879 --> 03:25.848
have fun,
but don't touch anything.

03:25.849 --> 03:27.950
Thank you, The Captain.
Challenge accepted.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.270
Wow.

03:31.271 --> 03:33.606
"The future of
Goliath National Bank"?

03:33.607 --> 03:35.825
I know, it's so, uh...

03:35.826 --> 03:38.194
You know, I totally forgot
to tell you, but, um,

03:38.195 --> 03:41.497
the other day, Arthur offered
me a five-year contract.

03:41.498 --> 03:44.784
Oh, well, don't turn him down
here in public.

03:44.785 --> 03:47.570
I broke up with Scooter
at the prom.

03:47.571 --> 03:49.622
Right before the picture, too.

03:52.442 --> 03:55.511
So whatever you do, don't tell
him here tonight, 'cause...

03:55.512 --> 03:57.146
I think I'm going to say yes.

04:01.184 --> 04:03.619
Ah, that's the stuff.

04:03.620 --> 04:13.690
Sync for <font color="#ffff00">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:16.632 --> 04:18.801
I didn't realize you
were small potatoes.

04:18.802 --> 04:22.071
And to be clear, I am
referring to your testicles.

04:29.079 --> 04:30.312
Impressive.

04:31.181 --> 04:33.382
Try this on for size.

04:35.000 --> 04:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:42.292 --> 04:43.625
You want to dance?

04:44.127 --> 04:45.428
Let's dance.

04:48.732 --> 04:50.332
I live for the dance.

04:50.333 --> 04:54.336
Get... your other hand...

04:54.337 --> 04:56.305
off my ass.

04:56.306 --> 04:58.474
Sorry, sorry.

04:59.809 --> 05:02.144
What do you mean,
you're going to say yes?

05:02.145 --> 05:04.497
I-I want to keep
working at GNB.

05:04.498 --> 05:05.781
But I thought that you...

05:05.782 --> 05:06.832
Guys, guys, guys?

05:06.833 --> 05:08.501
Architecture fun fact:

05:08.502 --> 05:11.170
If you stand right here,
and you whisper,

05:11.171 --> 05:12.988
a person all the way across
the other end of the room

05:12.989 --> 05:15.124
hears it like you're standing
right next to them.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.959
It's one of the most
sophisticated pieces

05:16.960 --> 05:19.261
of acoustical design
in the world. Watch.

05:19.262 --> 05:21.030
Diarrhea.

05:22.833 --> 05:25.634
Right? Right?

05:25.635 --> 05:28.220
But a five-year
contract.

05:28.221 --> 05:29.805
I thought you hated GNB.

05:29.806 --> 05:31.307
Look, I don't hate all of it.

05:31.308 --> 05:32.508
Tonight's fun.

05:32.509 --> 05:33.809
Take a look around.

05:33.810 --> 05:35.194
I mean, this is
pretty high-class.

05:35.195 --> 05:36.879
Poo-poo.

05:38.415 --> 05:40.199
Poo-poo platter.

05:42.986 --> 05:44.553
Zoey?

05:52.596 --> 05:53.730
Well, well, well.

05:54.359 --> 05:56.660
You have got to be kidding me.

05:56.661 --> 05:57.928
So, what are we protesting
tonight?

05:57.929 --> 05:59.864
Rising cost of jet fuel?

05:59.865 --> 06:03.100
The government's oppressive
top hat and monocle tax?

06:03.101 --> 06:04.535
And what are you doing here?

06:04.536 --> 06:06.170
Oh, right.

06:06.171 --> 06:08.739
Beautiful old building...
you're here to knock it down.

06:09.541 --> 06:10.908
Can I finish my drink first?

06:10.909 --> 06:12.176
Darling, there you are.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.344
Hi.
Hi.

06:13.345 --> 06:15.379
Ted, this is my husband.

06:16.348 --> 06:19.083
Yeah, old stuff's great.

06:28.093 --> 06:31.529
Mmm. Ah, this Scotch
is good. How's your drink?

06:31.530 --> 06:34.598
This is ridiculous.

06:34.599 --> 06:38.235
We are two grown adults standing
among the greatest collection

06:38.236 --> 06:40.237
of natural artifacts
in the Western hemisphere,

06:40.238 --> 06:41.472
and look at what we're doing.

06:41.473 --> 06:44.275
You're right.

06:47.712 --> 06:49.980
Want to go touch
a bunch of stuff?

06:49.981 --> 06:51.816
Yeah, I do.

07:07.799 --> 07:09.400
So, Captain.

07:09.401 --> 07:10.734
How'd you get that name, anyway?

07:10.735 --> 07:12.203
Gave it to myself.

07:12.204 --> 07:14.405
A real man chooses
his own name.

07:14.406 --> 07:16.140
Well, pleased to meet you,
Captain.

07:16.141 --> 07:19.176
I'm Galactic President
Superstar McAwesomeville.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.878
This is Ted.
Capital.

07:20.879 --> 07:22.079
Honey, I may cut out early.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.914
I have to go check up
on the boat.

07:23.915 --> 07:25.699
The boat?
There's a boat?

07:25.700 --> 07:27.485
You must tell me about
this boat, Captain.

07:27.486 --> 07:29.653
Well, she's an 85-foot sloop.

07:29.654 --> 07:31.355
She!
Do you like boats?

07:31.356 --> 07:34.158
Does the sea call to you
like it calls to me?

07:34.159 --> 07:38.129
Yes. The sea is all like,
"Ted, come hang out."

07:38.130 --> 07:42.032
I like Galactic President
Superstar McAwesomeville.

07:42.033 --> 07:43.901
You're coming on
the boat sometime.

07:43.902 --> 07:45.219
Stepping off.

07:46.605 --> 07:50.107
Man, I wish me and my dad
were as close as you guys are.

07:50.108 --> 07:52.109
Oh. You want
to make this personal?

07:52.110 --> 07:53.561
Okay.

07:53.562 --> 07:56.580
Destroy Ted Mosby.

07:56.581 --> 07:57.781
Now it's personal.

07:57.782 --> 07:59.550
No, if I wanted
to make it personal,

07:59.551 --> 08:01.952
I'd call you
a bored little trophy wife

08:01.953 --> 08:03.420
who likes to play activist

08:03.421 --> 08:05.823
when the shops
on 5th Avenue are closed.

08:05.824 --> 08:07.224
You're going down.

08:07.225 --> 08:09.693
Down where?
To the yacht club?

08:09.694 --> 08:11.228
Oh! I would love to.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.830
W-w-wait.

08:12.831 --> 08:15.366
I'm half Jewish,
will that be a problem?

08:15.367 --> 08:18.068
So what about becoming
an environmental lawyer?

08:18.069 --> 08:20.037
What about saving the world?

08:20.038 --> 08:21.238
Wieners.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.840
That was a great dream.

08:22.841 --> 08:25.726
But we have a mortgage,
and we're trying to have kids.

08:25.727 --> 08:26.810
We're grown-ups now, Lily.

08:26.811 --> 08:28.512
Wieners and gonads.

08:28.513 --> 08:29.780
What would College You say

08:29.781 --> 08:31.682
if he heard what
you were saying right now?

08:31.683 --> 08:33.918
Honestly? Probably
something pretentious,

08:33.919 --> 08:35.152
and pseudo-intellectual, like...

08:35.153 --> 08:36.520
Boogers.

08:37.923 --> 08:39.289
We all change, Lily.

08:39.291 --> 08:42.092
You know, you don't spell
"women" with a "Y" anymore.

08:42.092 --> 08:44.361
And I'm okay with that.

08:44.362 --> 08:46.230
And you need to be okay
with the fact

08:46.231 --> 08:48.699
that I may never become
an environmental lawyer.

08:50.502 --> 08:52.603
So how long have
you felt this way?

08:52.604 --> 08:54.805
Honestly?

08:55.941 --> 08:58.042
Since my first day at GNB.

08:58.877 --> 09:01.045
Hershey squirts.

09:07.385 --> 09:10.554
Hey. How do you
like my date's tux?

09:10.555 --> 09:11.722
Ooh!

09:11.723 --> 09:13.307
Uh, a-thank you!

09:13.308 --> 09:16.060
Oh, none for him.
He's stuffed.

09:18.230 --> 09:20.397
Stuffed.

09:21.266 --> 09:23.767
Oh! Zoey! There you are.

09:23.768 --> 09:25.269
Oh, my God.

09:25.270 --> 09:27.271
You have a monocle.

09:27.272 --> 09:28.639
Is this real?

09:28.640 --> 09:29.873
Is this really happening?
Can you excuse us for a moment?

09:29.874 --> 09:31.659
Let's go for a walk.

09:31.660 --> 09:33.744
Good luck killing James Bond.

09:36.548 --> 09:38.132
Are we allowed in here?

09:38.133 --> 09:39.149
What do you want from me?

09:39.150 --> 09:40.851
I want my crossword day back.

09:40.852 --> 09:43.254
Okay? Go live your perfect
little life,

09:43.255 --> 09:44.521
and leave me the hell alone.

09:44.522 --> 09:45.889
My life isn't perfect.

09:45.890 --> 09:47.791
Oh, please,
what's your biggest problem?

09:47.792 --> 09:49.226
Having to sail
back to the marina

09:49.227 --> 09:51.161
because the Captain's
all out of white Zin?

09:53.064 --> 09:54.965
Oh. Great.
Now you're crying.

09:54.966 --> 09:57.067
Like that's going
to get my sympathy.

09:57.068 --> 10:00.304
<i>It did.</i>

10:00.305 --> 10:03.240
You've known about this
for two and a half years?

10:03.241 --> 10:04.642
So every time you've

10:04.643 --> 10:07.478
talked about wanting to be an
environmental lawyer since then,

10:07.479 --> 10:08.612
that was a lie.

10:08.613 --> 10:11.181
Technically, I never lied.

10:11.816 --> 10:13.617
You asked me questions,

10:13.618 --> 10:16.787
and I responded
with made-up words.

10:16.788 --> 10:18.055
What?

10:18.056 --> 10:20.958
So, you'll probably quit GNB
in a couple years, right?

10:20.959 --> 10:22.793
Affirmatootly.

10:22.794 --> 10:24.495
And become
an environmental lawyer?

10:24.496 --> 10:25.829
Yepskerdoodles.

10:25.830 --> 10:27.865
Hey, by the way,
do you like this scarf?

10:27.866 --> 10:32.002
Posititochadochmecochepopocha.

10:32.003 --> 10:33.270
Lawyered.

10:33.271 --> 10:35.472
Okay, that's also
a made-up word.

10:35.473 --> 10:38.475
Okay. Lily,
what do you want from me?

10:38.476 --> 10:42.413
I want you to be the person
I fell in love with.

10:54.626 --> 10:56.794
Niled it!

10:56.795 --> 10:58.829
Excuse me.

10:59.530 --> 11:01.298
Thank God you're here.

11:01.299 --> 11:04.902
She's been messing
with the exhibits.

11:04.903 --> 11:07.371
I got married when I was 22

11:07.372 --> 11:10.541
to a man who calls himself
The Captain.

11:10.542 --> 11:13.477
He seems like a good guy.

11:13.478 --> 11:16.447
He wears those red pants.

11:16.448 --> 11:18.182
I hate boats, Ted.

11:18.817 --> 11:20.250
I do, I hate 'em.

11:20.251 --> 11:21.585
I can't be on them.

11:21.586 --> 11:22.920
I can't be near them.

11:22.921 --> 11:25.589
I can't even think about them
without getting seasick.

11:26.725 --> 11:30.894
You want to know why I want
to save that building?

11:30.895 --> 11:33.030
Because when I look up
at The Arcadian,

11:33.031 --> 11:36.600
I see something big and solid,

11:36.601 --> 11:39.069
and right now everything else
in my life

11:39.070 --> 11:41.205
just feels like I'm on a boat.

11:42.340 --> 11:45.743
I know it's crazy to care
that much about a building.

11:45.744 --> 11:47.244
It's not crazy at all.

11:47.245 --> 11:48.479
I'm the same way.

11:48.480 --> 11:50.130
Look, Zoey,

11:50.131 --> 11:54.451
The Arcadian should be
a landmark, it should.

11:54.452 --> 11:57.821
The lion head stonework
is iconic.

11:58.857 --> 12:00.724
I hate that we have
to tear it down.

12:00.725 --> 12:02.526
I hate working for GNB.

12:02.527 --> 12:06.864
They're a bunch of wieners
and gonads.

12:06.865 --> 12:09.800
Ted, that was...

12:09.801 --> 12:12.069
really easy.

12:12.070 --> 12:13.737
What?

12:15.807 --> 12:19.710
They're a
bunch of wieners and gonads.

12:19.711 --> 12:22.079
This should be useful.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.447
<i>And in that moment,</i>

12:23.448 --> 12:25.816
<i>another headline appeared</i>
<i>before my eyes.</i>

12:31.723 --> 12:33.190
You tricked me.

12:33.191 --> 12:35.058
Well, it the bug room, Ted.

12:35.059 --> 12:37.261
Your ass just got bugged.

12:39.431 --> 12:41.682
Oh, the offer still stands.

12:41.683 --> 12:44.668
We simply must have you out
on the boat sometime.

12:53.221 --> 12:54.821
Well, aren't you two clever.

12:55.328 --> 12:56.729
Well, guess what,
this museum has seen

12:56.730 --> 12:58.414
every kind of prank
you can think of.

12:58.415 --> 12:59.448
Mummies playing poker,

12:59.449 --> 13:01.700
penguins sticking
out of volcanoes,

13:01.701 --> 13:03.636
dinosaurs from
the Cretaceous period

13:03.637 --> 13:05.905
hanging out with dinosaurs
from the Jurassic period.

13:05.906 --> 13:07.973
One time a kid knocked down
the blue whale.

13:07.974 --> 13:09.408
You name it...

13:09.409 --> 13:11.744
I'm sorry. Did you say someone
knocked down the blue whale?

13:11.745 --> 13:13.045
Oh no, not just someone.

13:13.046 --> 13:14.079
A six-year-old.

13:14.080 --> 13:15.214
Oh, yeah, that
story is legend...

13:15.215 --> 13:17.449
Hold on.

13:17.450 --> 13:19.134
...dary.

13:19.135 --> 13:21.620
And, um, would you
happen to know

13:21.621 --> 13:23.556
what that young man's name was?

13:23.557 --> 13:25.891
No.

13:25.892 --> 13:29.562
But I could,
uh, check the files.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.500
Thank you.

13:34.501 --> 13:36.702
Now, Arthur, your turn.

13:36.703 --> 13:38.404
I just sang three songs.

13:38.405 --> 13:41.240
Now you-you do your part
from <i>Guys and Dolls.</i>

13:44.578 --> 13:46.812
Take your seats, everyone.

13:46.813 --> 13:48.747
The show's about to start.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.083
Douche.

13:55.622 --> 13:58.957
So I hear my wife
got you pretty good.

14:00.760 --> 14:03.796
She caught me on
tape trashing GNB.

14:03.797 --> 14:05.831
Oh, that damn recorder.

14:05.832 --> 14:07.533
Try being married to that.

14:07.534 --> 14:11.737
"But you said you'd get the
corgis neutered this weekend."

14:11.738 --> 14:13.405
"I said no such thing."

14:13.406 --> 14:15.608
"Oh, yeah?" Click.

14:16.977 --> 14:18.410
You're a good guy,

14:18.411 --> 14:21.013
Galactic President
Superstar McAwesomeville.

14:22.048 --> 14:23.716
Tell you what,
when Zoey goes to sleep,

14:23.717 --> 14:25.784
I'll find that tape
and erase it for you.

14:25.785 --> 14:26.919
No hard feelings.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.020
Really?

14:28.021 --> 14:29.822
You'd do that to your own wife?

14:29.823 --> 14:31.123
Sure. Why not?

14:31.124 --> 14:34.226
I mean, I'm glad she has
these little causes,

14:34.227 --> 14:35.828
they keep her out of trouble,

14:35.829 --> 14:37.997
but when she throws
a temper tantrum

14:37.998 --> 14:39.398
and it gets in the way
of someone doing their job,

14:39.399 --> 14:41.066
that's a problem.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.968
No, you know what?

14:42.969 --> 14:44.837
Don't erase the tape.

14:44.838 --> 14:46.672
And for what it's worth,

14:46.673 --> 14:48.707
I don't think
she's throwing temper tantrums.

14:48.708 --> 14:50.009
I just think she's, you know,

14:50.010 --> 14:52.044
standing up
for what she believes in.

14:52.746 --> 14:54.480
I respect that.

14:55.715 --> 14:57.883
Hey, what about this?

14:57.884 --> 15:00.419
I'll take you out
on the boat sometime.

15:01.087 --> 15:03.689
You've got to see this boat.

15:03.690 --> 15:05.324
She's breathtaking.

15:05.325 --> 15:08.027
<i>Kids, there's an amazing</i>
<i>architectural phenomenon</i>

15:08.028 --> 15:09.962
in the Natural History Museum.

15:09.963 --> 15:11.664
If you stand in the right spot,

15:11.665 --> 15:14.523
<i>you can hear</i>
<i>an entire conversation</i>

15:16.180 --> 15:17.483
<i>all the way across the room.</i>

15:20.206 --> 15:21.974
July 23, 1981,

15:21.975 --> 15:23.075
incident report.

15:23.076 --> 15:25.778
At approximately 1000 hours,

15:25.779 --> 15:26.779
No.
...vandal dislodged

15:26.780 --> 15:30.549
rib from triceratops skeleton...
No...

15:30.550 --> 15:32.384
...and flung said rib
at giant whale.

15:32.385 --> 15:33.986
No.

15:33.987 --> 15:37.189
Causing said giant whale to fall
in a downward trajectory.

15:37.190 --> 15:38.557
No.
And the vandal's name...

15:38.558 --> 15:40.492
No.

15:40.493 --> 15:43.429
Well, I'll be damned...
Barney Stinson.

15:43.430 --> 15:45.230
No! No!

15:45.231 --> 15:47.366
Who's the master, Leroy?

15:47.367 --> 15:48.834
Stinson was reprimanded

15:48.835 --> 15:52.604
and returned to the custody
of his father, Jerome Whittaker.

15:52.605 --> 15:55.207
Uh, no, uncle.
Jerome Whittaker is my uncle.

15:55.208 --> 15:57.209
Uncle Jerry. Says father.
Even signed it

15:57.210 --> 16:00.045
and checked the box
for father and everything.

16:01.915 --> 16:05.617
Jerry's my uncle.

16:15.695 --> 16:17.930
Lily?

16:20.934 --> 16:22.634
Honey, what's wrong?

16:22.635 --> 16:24.103
You okay?

16:24.104 --> 16:26.338
Do you want a hit
of this sandwich?

16:26.339 --> 16:28.407
I want you.

16:28.408 --> 16:31.960
Awesome. Let me just put
a sock on the doorknob.

16:31.961 --> 16:33.979
No. I mean, I want you

16:33.980 --> 16:36.648
as opposed to who you've become.

16:36.649 --> 16:39.284
You've changed so much.

16:39.285 --> 16:41.186
What? How have I changed?

16:41.187 --> 16:43.922
Did I cheat on you?

16:43.923 --> 16:44.857
No.

16:44.858 --> 16:46.425
Did I stop writing poems
for you?

16:46.426 --> 16:48.761
Yes, but I'm okay with that.

16:48.762 --> 16:53.465
Am I not as good at making
the sweet, sweet love to you?

16:53.466 --> 16:55.667
Actually, you're way better now.

16:55.668 --> 16:58.570
You last, like, two,
three times as long.

16:58.571 --> 17:01.273
You said that any longer
would be too much.

17:01.274 --> 17:04.943
It's okay. College Lily thinks
those are orgasms.

17:04.944 --> 17:06.612
No, it's...

17:06.613 --> 17:08.047
it's none of that.

17:08.048 --> 17:11.717
It's just this new Marshall...
Corporate Marshall...

17:11.718 --> 17:13.117
he wears suits

17:13.118 --> 17:14.619
all the time.

17:14.621 --> 17:17.021
He doesn't care about
saving the world.

17:17.022 --> 17:19.525
He's not you.

17:19.526 --> 17:21.492
I want you back.

17:21.493 --> 17:24.829
Well, you can't have me.

17:24.830 --> 17:28.700
Look at the sign.

17:28.701 --> 17:30.269
I'm extinct.

17:30.270 --> 17:32.571
I've gone the way
of Jane's Addiction.

17:32.572 --> 17:34.973
Actually, Jane's Addiction
got back together.

17:34.974 --> 17:36.442
They did?

17:36.443 --> 17:39.178
Yeah, they've done a few tours,
they put out a new album.

17:39.179 --> 17:41.080
Are you serious?!
That is awesome!

17:41.081 --> 17:42.347
Are they just as good?

17:42.348 --> 17:43.849
Sure.

17:43.850 --> 17:47.619
Look, I know that
Corporate Marshall

17:47.620 --> 17:51.356
wears a tie and everything,
but it sounds like

17:51.357 --> 17:54.326
he hasn't changed
where it counts.

17:59.999 --> 18:01.032
Hey.

18:01.033 --> 18:02.167
Hi.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.269
Look, Lily,

18:04.270 --> 18:06.438
I know that you
would have been okay

18:06.439 --> 18:09.308
if we were poor and I was
trying to save the world,

18:09.309 --> 18:11.443
but will you still be okay

18:11.444 --> 18:13.512
if I make a lot of money

18:13.513 --> 18:17.616
and I spend all of it
spoiling you and our kids?

18:18.952 --> 18:21.353
We'll make it work.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.930
There he goes.

18:31.931 --> 18:34.099
The Marathon Man.

18:34.100 --> 18:36.535
Mr. Stamina himself.

18:36.536 --> 18:41.373
I can kiss better
than that old man.

18:41.374 --> 18:44.409
So when was the last
time you saw him?

18:44.410 --> 18:47.146
It was that day...

18:47.147 --> 18:49.948
July 23, 1981.

18:49.949 --> 18:52.518
My mom got pretty mad
that he let me destroy

18:52.519 --> 18:54.052
a New York City landmark.

18:54.053 --> 18:55.988
Moms.

18:55.989 --> 18:58.790
He never came around
anymore after that.

18:59.592 --> 19:02.327
Think he moved away.

19:02.328 --> 19:04.796
Well, maybe the security guy
had it wrong.

19:04.797 --> 19:06.565
You never know...

19:06.566 --> 19:09.735
But you do know, you do know.
That's the thing. You know.

19:11.738 --> 19:14.273
He's my dad.

19:14.274 --> 19:16.241
Barney, do you want...?

19:16.242 --> 19:17.793
I don't want to do anything.

19:17.794 --> 19:20.279
Don't tell anyone
about this, okay?

19:21.714 --> 19:23.415
I'm serious.
It's a great look.

19:23.416 --> 19:25.334
I think it could come
back, but one question.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.469
Does it cost half
as much as glasses?

19:27.470 --> 19:29.287
Can I steal you for a second?

19:33.843 --> 19:35.460
You don't need
to worry. I...

19:35.461 --> 19:36.962
What are you doing?

19:36.963 --> 19:39.765
Oh, I thought we were...

19:39.766 --> 19:42.034
Fine.

19:42.802 --> 19:44.469
I erased the tape.

19:44.470 --> 19:46.071
What?

19:46.072 --> 19:47.506
I don't need it.

19:47.507 --> 19:49.241
I'm going to beat
you fair and square.

19:49.242 --> 19:51.777
Thanks.

19:51.778 --> 19:52.995
But it's good to know

19:52.996 --> 19:56.949
how easily you can be
manipulated by a woman.

19:56.950 --> 19:59.651
You look gross when
you cry, you know that?

19:59.652 --> 20:01.453
Some women look cute.

20:01.454 --> 20:03.388
You look like a basset hound.

20:03.389 --> 20:05.457
Oh, laugh it up now.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.426
Because starting Monday,

20:07.427 --> 20:09.327
I got you in my crosshairs.

20:09.328 --> 20:11.763
Bring it on, Princess.

20:34.192 --> 20:35.326
Eriksen...

20:35.405 --> 20:37.640
It's, uh, 3:00 a.m.

20:37.641 --> 20:41.844
You know what, you might
as well not even go home.

20:49.019 --> 20:51.887
And so Marshall stayed right on
<i>at Goliath National Bank.</i>

20:51.888 --> 20:55.925
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it wouldn't last forever.</i>

20:55.926 --> 20:59.127
<i>But that's another story.</i>
