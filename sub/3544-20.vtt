00:02.160 --> 00:03.880
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.920 --> 00:07.129
Travelers are about to make their move.
Their leader, Markos, is here.

00:07.280 --> 00:10.124
The blood of the doppelgangers
can undo the witch's curse...

00:10.320 --> 00:13.927
that prevents us from finding a home.
We can break that curse.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.407
- Where the hell am I?
- Welcome back, Julian.

00:17.320 --> 00:18.890
You passengered into a hybrid.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.840
Something's wrong over here, Bonnie.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.764
Whatever the Travelers did,
whoever managed to get through...

00:23.960 --> 00:25.769
it's got the witches scared.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.525
What about you? Any pretty girls?

00:27.720 --> 00:29.768
Actually, there was one.
Her name was Maggie.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.083
Seventy years of captivity
and she was the face that I clung onto.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.169
I didn't know she was your Maggie.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.241
You won't stop until you kill Damon.

00:40.440 --> 00:44.684
It'll be a sweet piece of revenge when Damon
finds out you killed his best friend.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.768
Damon thinks that Enzo left town.

00:49.960 --> 00:52.042
We need to keep it that way.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.009
Wake up, babe.

01:12.720 --> 01:14.131
Missed you.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.691
Julian. Is it still you?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.131
Yeah.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.807
Bad dream.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.485
What were you saying?

01:30.240 --> 01:31.685
Mm.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.245
Oh.

01:35.680 --> 01:37.921
Look, I'm always up
for a little bit of kink but...

01:38.120 --> 01:41.920
Heh. Markos' orders. I put them on
you as soon as you fell asleep.

01:42.160 --> 01:43.844
You passengered in a hybrid.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.650
Can't risk him popping out.

01:46.680 --> 01:48.921
Pecs are a plus.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.003
- But excess security is a minus.
- Maria.

01:55.200 --> 01:56.406
We're on the move.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.046
Looks like this is gonna have to wait.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.281
- Where are we going?
- To the next camp.

02:09.520 --> 02:11.488
Which will hopefully be our last camp.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.364
Markos is ready to do the spell.

02:13.560 --> 02:15.483
- He's taken the doppelgangers.
- Today?

02:15.680 --> 02:17.603
As soon as we're out of here.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.368
Soon we can actually have a home.

02:20.560 --> 02:22.369
And I can finally have a closet.

02:22.560 --> 02:25.928
Better yet two closets.
One for clothes and one for shoes.

02:29.040 --> 02:30.087
Julian.

02:31.080 --> 02:32.286
Julian.

02:33.080 --> 02:34.127
Babe, what's wrong?

02:36.160 --> 02:37.207
Open your eyes.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.406
Oh, my God. You're not...

02:55.600 --> 02:57.443
I need help! Somebody!

03:46.280 --> 03:47.520
That's not helping.

03:47.680 --> 03:49.842
You've been failing for an hour,
wonder twin...

03:50.080 --> 03:52.651
so at this point I can't
imagine it's hurting.

03:53.120 --> 03:57.444
Damon, I know you're out a friend but, uh, I'm
not sure this guy's the best replacement.

03:57.640 --> 04:02.521
I don't think this guy's the best anything if
his locator-spell skills are any indication.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.047
Yo. Where's your sister?

04:05.680 --> 04:07.603
She's tired of being almost murdered.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.406
Look, I can find any person
anywhere on the planet.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.804
Okay? There's just something weird
with your friend Enzo. I can't get a read.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.161
Enzo.

04:17.519 --> 04:20.204
- Didn't he, uh, go to Cape Horn?
- He flipped his humanity switch.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.880
There should have been a body count
all the way to the airport.

04:23.000 --> 04:24.365
Ah.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.330
- Why are you looking for him?
- Gee, I don't know, Stefan.

04:27.520 --> 04:32.686
A vampire with no humanity who wants
me dead for killing his girl. Hmm.

04:32.880 --> 04:36.248
Well, maybe he hired a witch to block
whatever Luke's doing.

04:36.440 --> 04:39.046
- Is that possible?
- A cloaking spell?

04:39.920 --> 04:42.764
- I guess.
- Would mean that he doesn't wanna be found.

04:42.960 --> 04:45.361
So, uh, why don't you just drop it?

04:49.800 --> 04:51.086
We have a problem.

04:53.120 --> 04:56.442
Markos turned Sloan into a vampire,
had her drink doppelganger blood...

04:56.640 --> 04:59.610
and after some chanty ritual thing,
she turned human again.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.003
- He cured her?
- He cured her to death.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.727
Blood took her vampirism. Left her in
the state she was before she turned.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.730
- That state being dead. Got it.
- So it kills vampires.

05:08.880 --> 05:11.963
- What's the spell mean for the witches?
- No one cares. Keep going.

05:12.200 --> 05:15.886
They feel if they get rid of all magic,
they'll break some lame-ass witch curse.

05:16.120 --> 05:19.408
Markos said they can't settle
without evoking earthquakes or hellfire.

05:19.560 --> 05:22.086
They break that curse,
they move on in to Mystic Falls.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.681
And come after Elena and me today.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.524
- As in now.
- Oh, well.

05:26.760 --> 05:29.161
Markos had a good week
in the land of the living.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.489
- Now, where is he so I can kill him?
- No idea.

05:32.720 --> 05:35.200
- They were moving camp.
- Our friend Luke here...

05:35.400 --> 05:37.323
is an alleged genius
at locator spells.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.166
Travelers are always moving.
They're impossible to track.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.880
They'll find Stefan and Elena
before we can find them.

05:43.080 --> 05:45.686
What about one of those
locator spell blocker deals?

05:45.880 --> 05:47.609
Is that simple enough for you?

05:47.800 --> 05:50.451
If both doppelgangers
are in the same place, yeah.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.161
Perfect. You avoid the entire Czech
language, figure out how to finds Markos.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.283
How am I supposed to do that?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.929
Well, you have a Traveler inside of you.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.964
I have probably misplaced faith
that you'll figure it out.

06:02.120 --> 06:05.329
You and I and our ex-girlfriend
are gonna go on a little secret trip.

06:06.800 --> 06:08.529
Sounds great.

06:09.280 --> 06:10.770
<i>This is</i> a <i>terrible idea.</i>

06:11.640 --> 06:13.290
Well, what did you want me to say?

06:13.480 --> 06:18.805
"No, Damon, it'll be awkward to have the three
of us confined to Caroline's dad's cabin...

06:19.000 --> 06:22.846
because I killed your best friend
and Elena is keeping it a secret for me"?

06:24.400 --> 06:25.526
We should have told him.

06:25.720 --> 06:28.610
Look, I don't trust
that he'd be able to hold it together.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.882
Because Enzo's dead
or because you killed him?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.481
Either. Both. I don't know. Either way.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.170
Good news.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.601
So we don't have to be invited in. Heh.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.521
Which is actually super sad
if you think about it.

06:41.680 --> 06:43.330
Mm.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.769
- Am I interrupting something?
- No, no, we're just, um...

06:47.920 --> 06:51.163
Uh, unpacking. We're unpacking.

06:51.320 --> 06:53.448
Uh, there you go.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.681
Okay.

07:05.360 --> 07:07.886
So where's Damon now?

07:08.080 --> 07:10.447
- Helping Luke set up.
- Helping Luke or avoiding me?

07:10.640 --> 07:13.689
- Really don't think he wants to be around you?
- Well, he said:

07:13.880 --> 07:16.884
"I don't wanna hear your voice
and I don't wanna see your face."

07:17.080 --> 07:18.491
Because it's too hard for him.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.286
Who do you think
brought you home last night?

07:21.720 --> 07:22.767
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.401
- Tucked you in.
- That was an extreme circumstance.

07:25.600 --> 07:26.681
Enzo almost killed me.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.127
Probably read you a nice
little bedtime story.

07:30.720 --> 07:33.963
Stop it. Heh. You're the
least-helpful person I know.

07:34.160 --> 07:37.403
For a couple of targets,
you two seem to be taking this in stride.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.881
Yeah, well, you know...

07:40.040 --> 07:43.249
a tribe of, uh, ancient wanna-be witches
wanna drain of us our blood...

07:43.480 --> 07:46.484
and, uh, eliminate supernatural beings.
I've had worse.

08:18.680 --> 08:21.251
For some reason,
I thought that would feel better.

08:34.640 --> 08:35.687
Cozy.

08:39.080 --> 08:43.164
Yeah, Caroline used to invite me here
before her parents split.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.682
Her dad could tell a
pretty good ghost story.

08:46.840 --> 08:50.526
I hope that dickwad's spirit
isn't floating around anywhere.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.400
- Have a little respect for the dead.
- I respect that he's dead.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.085
How about that?

09:04.320 --> 09:05.845
I'm supposed to be avoiding you.

09:12.360 --> 09:16.126
- Is that still what you want?
- Yes.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.570
No.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.081
I don't know.

09:24.840 --> 09:29.641
Well, Luke did the cloaking spell. Stefan
and Caroline are here so we should be good.

09:30.440 --> 09:33.046
- But if it's too hard for you...
- Are you kicking me out?

09:34.680 --> 09:38.002
Yes. No. I don't know.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.360
I'm really sorry Enzo came after you.

09:47.600 --> 09:49.602
That was my fault. He was hurt.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.366
It's not a big deal.

09:53.560 --> 09:56.530
It is a big deal. He
almost killed you, Elena.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.849
I'm gonna hunt his ass down,
I'm gonna whip some sense into him.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.884
I'm gonna make him apologize
in person, okay?

10:08.320 --> 10:11.369
- What?
- Hmm? No, nothing. I just, uh...

10:11.560 --> 10:14.530
I remembered Stefan asked me
to help him bring some firewood in.

10:14.720 --> 10:16.882
So I'll be right back.

10:31.440 --> 10:32.851
What?

10:33.040 --> 10:38.001
What are we gonna do about the Other Side
slipping off into oblivion and you with it?

10:38.240 --> 10:43.485
We have the dorm to ourselves for an entire
weekend and you wanna talk logistics?

10:45.120 --> 10:49.728
I would enjoy this weekend a whole lot more
if I knew we were able to keep doing it.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.964
I told you Liv is working on a spell
to keep me here.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.483
- Oh. Another secret bro meeting?
- No more secrets, remember?

11:09.280 --> 11:10.486
Tyler's back.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.929
We should get over there.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.963
Let me grab my stuff.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.650
Please.

11:37.880 --> 11:42.010
Tell me more about this special spell
that your friend Liv has concocted.

11:43.680 --> 11:45.409
I know I shouldn't lie.

11:45.640 --> 11:49.804
He deserves the truth, Bonnie.
It's not getting any better over here.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.209
People are getting swept away.

11:53.440 --> 11:57.081
And when this place goes,
you are going with it.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.841
I know I have to tell him. I just need
a few more days with him before...

12:13.640 --> 12:15.688
How did you do that?

12:15.920 --> 12:20.164
How did you move that?
You can't move things from the Other Side.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.409
- That doesn't happen.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

12:24.320 --> 12:29.042
This place is falling apart.
Tell him. Soon.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.531
False hope doesn't protect him.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.202
It protects you.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.287
- I lied to his face.
- Yeah, I know.

12:46.440 --> 12:48.966
You know what?
Think of all the times he's lied to you.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.328
Call it a freebie.

12:55.080 --> 12:57.048
Glad you two find my death so amusing.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.083
Sorry that you have to go through this.

12:59.280 --> 13:02.204
You're sorry for that?
Glad we've got our priorities straight.

13:02.400 --> 13:05.529
I know that we're doing this for Damon
but it still just sucks.

13:05.760 --> 13:09.526
Elena, this is exactly what Enzo wanted.
He wanted the blood to be on my hands.

13:09.760 --> 13:12.570
I refuse to give him the satisfaction
of feeling guilty.

13:12.760 --> 13:15.889
You think Damon is just gonna forget
and move on?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.923
He's done it before.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.730
Let's get out of here.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.410
Now, there's an interesting development.

13:52.080 --> 13:53.969
Hey. Munchy, that's enough for you.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.083
Shh. I'm thinking.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.850
<i>Hey-</i>

13:59.080 --> 14:01.287
- "Area 51
- Stop.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.761
"JFK assassination." What the hell is that?

14:04.400 --> 14:05.765
You're ruining the game.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.850
- What game?
- Charades.

14:09.080 --> 14:12.880
Our theme is secrets that people think
that they're getting away with.

14:13.120 --> 14:17.489
Well, Meryl Streep, I'd love to know
how we're gonna act out "Watergate."

14:17.680 --> 14:22.402
- Well, I'm sure Team Stelena will figure it out.
- A, you just implied that I was on your team.

14:22.600 --> 14:25.649
Two, you just gave me
that judgey little hinty voice.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.967
So, what am I missing?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.485
It's probably nothing.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.127
Uh...

14:34.560 --> 14:36.050
Speak.

14:38.720 --> 14:43.647
Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena
have been a little... you know.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.929
- No, clearly, I don't.
- Secretive?

14:47.120 --> 14:49.885
I caught them being all hushed
and whispery at the car.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.521
Now they're getting wood
out of the shed together...

14:52.720 --> 14:54.722
which apparently takes 20 minutes.

14:54.920 --> 14:56.649
You know, now that you mention it...

14:56.800 --> 14:58.928
Elena got all cagey
when I brought up Enzo.

14:59.480 --> 15:05.044
No, no, I'm not talking about Enzo.
I'm talking about Stefan and Elena.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.927
- How much have you had to drink?
- Come on.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.401
She's single now, you two are on the outs.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.047
- Cocktails. Good call.
- I'll, uh, make a fire.

15:20.280 --> 15:21.441
I'll help. Ahem.

15:23.040 --> 15:25.520
Let the games begin.

15:38.680 --> 15:43.049
When we planned our romantic day together, I
wasn't picturing you, me and two other guys.

15:44.480 --> 15:47.689
Trust me, neither was I.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.009
One part wolfsbane, one part vervain.

16:04.200 --> 16:05.690
Altogether the dumbest idea...

16:05.840 --> 16:08.889
- ...either of you have ever had.
- Don't look at me. This is all Ty.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.650
These should hold.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.491
- Let's do this.
- Not to be the only girl here...

16:16.720 --> 16:18.245
but I can't watch this.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.241
I'm gonna go upstairs.

16:28.160 --> 16:31.482
Ty, once this guy pops out, we have no idea
when you'll come back again.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.127
Some freak is inside my body.
He took over my life.

16:34.320 --> 16:38.609
God only knows what he's got planned for me.
So unless you've got any better ideas...

16:38.760 --> 16:40.091
this is what we're doing.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.245
Okay, let's do this.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.567
Who are you? Where am I?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.125
Where's Markos?

17:08.319 --> 17:10.003
Go to hell.

17:10.520 --> 17:14.569
To answer your question, my name is Matt, and
you, Julian, are inside my best friend...

17:14.800 --> 17:17.451
a. k.a., your own personal hell.

17:38.360 --> 17:39.646
Maria.

17:40.320 --> 17:44.325
Julian's your husband. Why didn't you
realize he wasn't in control of the body?

17:44.480 --> 17:48.166
He'd only been called out for a few hours.
I've never seen a host re-emerge so quickly.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.968
You've never seen a hybrid before either.
Find him.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.322
And make him permanent.

17:56.600 --> 17:57.965
As for the rest of you...

17:58.160 --> 18:01.482
I see a lot of walking
when I should be hearing chanting.

18:01.720 --> 18:03.722
Find me the doppelgangers.

18:28.200 --> 18:31.522
Uh, okay, uh, think. Uh, ponder.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.889
Uh, brain.

18:34.040 --> 18:35.804
Uh, I don't know. Um...

18:35.960 --> 18:39.806
- Uh, skull. All right. Skull. Skull.
- Yes.

18:40.000 --> 18:43.368
Okay, uh, limb. Joints. Uh, bones.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.045
Bone. Bone. Skull and bones.

18:45.240 --> 18:46.366
- Yeah.
- Skull and bones.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.046
You got it.

18:48.240 --> 18:50.163
- Five-zero. Five-zero.
- Ha, ha.

18:50.360 --> 18:52.044
- Five-zip.
- Ha, ha.

18:54.560 --> 18:58.246
Okay, let's play a game
called Never Have I Ever, hmm?

19:00.240 --> 19:03.483
- Ah. I don't think I'm drunk enough.
- Oh, come on, it'll be fun.

19:03.680 --> 19:05.569
- Come on, it'll be fun.
<i>- I'll</i> go first.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.646
Never have I ever died.

19:08.800 --> 19:10.882
Pfft. Cheers to that one.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.409
- Cheers.
- Oh, okay, um...

19:13.600 --> 19:17.446
Never have I ever been, um, possessed
by my evil doppelganger.

19:17.600 --> 19:20.001
Pfft. Mean.

19:22.400 --> 19:25.927
Never have I ever been fooled
by my evil doppelganger...

19:26.120 --> 19:28.407
- while she was pretending to be me.
- Ah.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.608
- Low blow.
- Tough, but fair.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.441
- Never have I ever kissed a
Salvatore brother. STEFAN: Hmm.

19:34.600 --> 19:35.931
Mm-hm.

19:36.600 --> 19:38.443
Today.

19:43.960 --> 19:48.090
- So are you gonna drink or...?
- Are you implying something?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.442
Well, I'm gonna get another round.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.484
- Um, does anybody...?
- Never have I ever lied about where Enzo is.

20:06.600 --> 20:08.762
- Okay, what is going on?
- Nothing, obviously.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.487
- Nobody is drinking.
- Clearly, you know the rules of the game, right?

20:12.640 --> 20:13.766
If you lied, you drink.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.088
Oh, no, I understand the rules.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.609
This just got weird.

20:18.800 --> 20:23.328
I'm officially buzzed, so I'm gonna,
ahem, go and get ready for bed.

20:25.480 --> 20:28.802
Well, I could certainly use another round.

20:30.400 --> 20:32.164
Ah.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.843
Avoiding, are we?

21:05.280 --> 21:08.124
Nothing a hot bath won't fix.

21:08.320 --> 21:12.609
Wash the guilt straight down the drain.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.209
Damon!

22:06.080 --> 22:07.764
Elena!

22:10.040 --> 22:12.805
Come here. Hold on. What happened?

22:13.000 --> 22:14.843
- There was someone in here.
- Who?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.929
I don't know. I didn't see anyone.

22:18.120 --> 22:20.771
But I could feel someone pushing me
under the water.

22:21.800 --> 22:26.044
Okay. I'd blame it on the spirit of Bill
Forbes, but I don't think you're his type.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.726
Besides, why would a ghost
be targeting you?

22:29.640 --> 22:31.005
<i>Hey-</i>

22:32.640 --> 22:33.687
Elena.

22:34.880 --> 22:38.441
- Damon.
- What? Hey.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.803
There's plenty more where that came from.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.206
Where's Markos?

22:46.760 --> 22:48.603
What does it matter to you?

22:48.840 --> 22:51.650
He wants to kill my sister.
I wanna stop him.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.845
You're a fool.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.884
Markos destroyed your only weapon
against passengers like me.

22:58.080 --> 23:00.447
And there's no way
you'd kill your best friend.

23:14.400 --> 23:19.122
You're right. I don't plan on killing you.
But I do plan on getting my answers.

23:19.320 --> 23:20.481
Where is Markos?

23:30.560 --> 23:31.971
Stop!

23:32.720 --> 23:35.405
I can't tell you where Markos is
because I don't know.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.731
- But I can tell you where my body is.
- Why do we care?

23:39.920 --> 23:41.684
Because Markos doesn't like problems.

23:41.880 --> 23:45.009
And your boy escaping camp
means he's Markos' problem.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.521
- So?
- So knowing Markos...

23:47.720 --> 23:52.806
he's gonna wanna get rid of Tyler
for good by making this my body.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.971
Permanently.

24:00.600 --> 24:05.208
Stefan, hey. Remind me why I passed
on the cloaking spell party again?

24:05.400 --> 24:07.767
Well, it's not exactly a relaxing getaway.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.002
Are things getting worse on the Other Side?

24:10.480 --> 24:12.562
<i>- Why?
- Because something attacked Elena.</i>

24:12.800 --> 24:16.202
Is it possible that someone over there
could physically affect this plane?

24:17.040 --> 24:19.884
Actually, yeah.

24:20.080 --> 24:22.686
My grams knocked a lamp
right off my desk today.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.407
I doubt it's easy,
but if someone were emotional enough...

24:27.240 --> 24:30.608
- Enzo.
- Enzo's dead?

24:33.000 --> 24:35.685
Yeah. I, um...

24:36.080 --> 24:37.730
I killed him.

24:40.320 --> 24:42.891
So my powers of deduction really suck.

24:44.720 --> 24:48.611
- Why didn't you say anything?
- Because it's complicated.

24:48.840 --> 24:50.410
Enter the complication.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.126
Enzo's dead. You killed him. Elena told me.

24:53.320 --> 24:55.971
- So you didn't know, either?
- Nope.

24:56.760 --> 25:00.810
- And their secret really was about Enzo.
- Yep.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.970
You guys think we could, urn,
talk about this some other time?

25:04.160 --> 25:06.925
By all means, brother, at your convenience.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.761
Listen, the Other Side is falling apart.
It's allowing Enzo to mess with us.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.728
Enzo.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.331
You in here?

25:16.520 --> 25:19.205
- I don't reckon I'd miss this.
- Because knock it off.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.723
It doesn't make any sense.

25:21.920 --> 25:24.890
If Enzo wanted to kill Elena,
drowning her wouldn't have worked.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.691
Smart girl. I see why you like her so much.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.888
- Maybe he's trying to scare us.
- Warmer.

25:31.040 --> 25:35.364
Come on. You've almost got it.
What is Enzo up to?

25:37.240 --> 25:39.242
Drowning Elena was just a distraction.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.771
He figured out a way to kill us all
in one fell swoop.

25:45.560 --> 25:48.131
Did I mention that I missed you?

25:51.600 --> 25:54.331
Ugh. Crap.

25:54.520 --> 25:56.040
- Where's Luke?
- Who knows?

25:56.240 --> 25:59.961
We better find him
before the Travelers find us.

26:17.400 --> 26:18.925
Stop.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.090
I found them.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.769
- Luke!
- Luke! Where are you?

26:38.080 --> 26:39.923
Maybe Luke...

26:40.760 --> 26:44.446
- You're upset.
- I'm not upset. Just looking for Luke.

26:44.640 --> 26:47.769
You know, Luke who was here
to protect you and Stefan.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.368
Luke who's now missing because you
and Stefan lied about where Enzo was.

26:51.560 --> 26:55.246
And now the Travelers can find you
and wipe us all off the face of the earth.

26:55.440 --> 26:57.886
- I worried that if Damon found out...
- He'd flip out?

26:58.520 --> 27:01.763
And spiral, and kill a bunch
of innocent people? Yeah, I get that.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.402
I, however, am not Damon.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.730
So the fact that you lied to me about it
makes less sense.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.962
I didn't wanna put you
in an awkward position.

27:11.160 --> 27:15.324
Because it wasn't awkward when I accused you
and Stefan of being makeout buddies again?

27:15.880 --> 27:18.884
Actually, yes, it was.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.728
Where did that even come from?

27:24.720 --> 27:27.405
I have no idea.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.089
- Well, are you over it?
- Yes.

27:31.280 --> 27:34.921
Good. Now let's go find Luke.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.090
- You need to know why I lied to you.
- Nope, I don't.

27:41.280 --> 27:43.521
- Damon, come on.
- Just cut to the chase, Stefan.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.922
I'm not in a
"hash-out-our-differences" mood.

27:46.120 --> 27:49.966
Yes, I'm pissed you killed Enzo. I'm even
more pissed that you two lied about it.

27:50.160 --> 27:54.210
If I was in your shoes, I would've done it
too, except I would've done it months ago.

27:54.440 --> 27:58.365
- So the fact that you took this long...
- He was your friend.

28:02.480 --> 28:06.246
Yes, Stefan, he was my friend.

28:06.440 --> 28:11.367
Which is why I, above anyone else,
should've known that he was dead.

28:15.680 --> 28:18.160
Let's just find the stupid witch.

28:24.200 --> 28:28.603
Of course the creepy Travelers
are hiding their bodies in creepy caves.

28:28.800 --> 28:32.088
Try to think of them as romantic Travelers
in romantic caves...

28:32.280 --> 28:36.126
since we're technically still
on our date weekend.

28:37.160 --> 28:38.924
Right.

28:52.080 --> 28:53.445
Oh, my God.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.961
All these Travelers are passengered
inside people in Mystic Falls?

29:03.160 --> 29:06.130
I take it back. This is creepy.

29:06.320 --> 29:07.881
<i>DAMON'.
What'd you think I was gonna do?</i>

29:08.040 --> 29:09.326
What are you talking about?

29:09.520 --> 29:12.091
When I found out Enzo was dead.
Go on a rampage?

29:12.280 --> 29:15.762
Slaughter a bunch of innocent people?
What'd you think I was gonna do?

29:16.640 --> 29:18.404
Hate me.

29:20.400 --> 29:23.051
I thought you would, uh, hate me.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.924
You hear that?

29:31.320 --> 29:32.606
Yeah. Come on.

29:42.880 --> 29:46.248
- He's barely breathing.
- Why the hell would Enzo dump him here?

29:46.440 --> 29:48.090
I don't know.

29:50.960 --> 29:52.246
Smell that?

30:12.480 --> 30:14.528
Grab him. Let's go.

30:18.920 --> 30:20.251
Dick move, Enzo.

30:30.760 --> 30:35.163
- If only this wasn't totally avoidable.
- Really? Now you're doing I-told-you-so's?

30:35.360 --> 30:38.603
This isn't gonna stop, Stefan.
I killed his girl. You killed him.

30:38.800 --> 30:40.882
He's right. I like poetic justice.

30:41.080 --> 30:44.801
Damon Salvatore and his murderous brother
die a fiery death.

30:45.160 --> 30:46.605
Are you listening to me, Enzo?

30:47.920 --> 30:49.001
Is that a yes or a no?

30:49.600 --> 30:50.647
I can bring you back.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.881
Bonnie came back. Markos came back.
I'll find a way.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.770
But this has to stop.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.287
How do you think
you're able to do all this stuff?

30:59.480 --> 31:01.369
The Other Side's falling apart, Enzo.

31:01.560 --> 31:05.849
So you could either help me,
or you could blink out of existence.

31:07.440 --> 31:08.646
It's your choice.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.729
Go, Stefan. Get Luke out of here.

31:17.440 --> 31:19.363
He's the only one
that could hide you and Elena.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.650
<i>Ste'? an .</i>

31:25.720 --> 31:27.404
Go, now!

31:29.480 --> 31:31.005
Come on.

31:32.160 --> 31:33.730
Come on.

31:34.480 --> 31:35.527
Go on.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.928
Don't let me down again.

32:02.560 --> 32:05.928
- You sure Julian has an eagle tattoo?
- That's what he said.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.328
I'm pretty sure that's a dove.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.371
Or a really cute eagle.

32:21.720 --> 32:22.767
Moving on.

32:25.280 --> 32:29.080
I'm sorry. This is the worst date ever.

32:29.880 --> 32:34.010
We're together. In a cave of semi-conscious
Travelers who wanna take over our town.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.851
But it could be worse, right?

32:37.040 --> 32:39.361
Right. It could be.

32:45.280 --> 32:47.851
Jeremy? Jeremy!

32:48.040 --> 32:52.568
He may be a Hunter, but you'd be surprised at
how easy it is to restrict a man's airways.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.205
Please stop.

32:56.040 --> 32:57.565
Stop!

32:58.280 --> 33:01.409
Jeremy. Jeremy.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.165
Stop!

33:12.920 --> 33:13.967
Feeling okay?

33:15.360 --> 33:17.442
Liv and I should've killed you.

33:18.360 --> 33:23.241
Yeah, well, you didn't, and, uh,
I don't understand why, but thank you.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.122
Yeah, let's just say...

33:27.920 --> 33:30.241
my family's pretty screwed up.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.084
Not a whole lot of compassion.

33:32.320 --> 33:35.051
You guys are different.
You protect each other.

33:35.280 --> 33:37.931
We still need you to protect us,
so why don't you get your stuff...

33:38.080 --> 33:41.641
- ...and, uh, we can get the hell out of here.
- Yeah.

33:50.360 --> 33:51.850
I guess Enzo bought it.

33:52.600 --> 33:54.887
Bought what?

33:55.080 --> 33:57.208
Bring him back.
How do you plan on doing that?

33:57.400 --> 34:00.210
Markos found his way back.
It's not impossible.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.210
Unless you want him terrorizing us
for the rest of eternity.

34:04.280 --> 34:06.203
Not particularly.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.964
Mm-mm.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.402
Uh, look, I know that...

34:13.000 --> 34:16.163
I had to do that. For Enzo.

34:17.120 --> 34:19.440
It's the last time you'll hear about it
from me.

34:19.639 --> 34:20.880
Damon.

34:41.520 --> 34:45.241
- What do you mean, you lost Julian's body?
You-slash-he was right.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.168
The Travelers wanted it.

34:47.320 --> 34:50.324
But we'll find it.
We just need to figure out where they went.

34:50.520 --> 34:52.887
Hold on. What do they need his body for?

34:56.960 --> 35:00.362
Guys, talk to me. Why did they take it?

35:02.120 --> 35:05.522
What are they doing here? This is our home.
We can't let them take over.

35:05.760 --> 35:08.331
They won't. I got it handled. I promise.

35:08.480 --> 35:10.767
- Unh!
- Ty, what's wrong?

35:12.520 --> 35:13.567
I'm seeing things.

35:16.680 --> 35:18.967
- This body's incredible.
- Don't get used to it.

35:30.720 --> 35:33.041
- Tyler, talk to us.
- I don't know what's happening.

35:33.280 --> 35:36.329
It's like I'm seeing his life.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.330
Oh, my God.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.125
They started the spell
to make Julian permanent.

36:01.920 --> 36:04.082
Make it stop. Make it stop!

36:15.760 --> 36:17.649
Tyler.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.444
I take it you didn't find my body.

36:49.400 --> 36:52.131
Never have I ever...

36:52.840 --> 36:54.842
had a ghost try to burn me alive.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.690
Drink.

36:59.840 --> 37:02.047
Come on. Car's packed.
We gotta get out of here.

37:02.840 --> 37:04.365
We're friends, right?

37:07.280 --> 37:10.443
We tell each other things,
trust each other.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.769
Caroline, it's not because
I didn't trust you.

37:14.000 --> 37:17.368
It's just that you trust Elena more.
I get it. Of course you would.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.569
Still sucks to be left out of the loop,
you know?

37:24.240 --> 37:28.211
If it makes you feel any better, there are
things I tell you that I don't tell her.

37:28.880 --> 37:32.441
- Like what?
- Like, you have dirt on your cheek.

37:38.000 --> 37:43.291
And, look, maybe I didn't want you to know
that I killed Enzo.

37:44.320 --> 37:45.890
- Why?
- Because I know you...

37:46.080 --> 37:49.880
and I know you guys had that weird
little chemistry thing going on.

37:50.120 --> 37:53.488
Oh, please. You're delusional.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.564
I didn't want you to think any less of me.

38:07.040 --> 38:11.170
I'll, uh, meet you over by the car
when you're done.

38:37.400 --> 38:40.449
- Hey.
- Hey, we're leaving. Pack your stuff.

38:41.120 --> 38:44.124
I will. I just came out
to see how you were doing.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.847
I'm in a hurry. You should be too.
The Travelers can find us.

38:49.360 --> 38:53.684
- So that's it? We're not gonna talk about this?
- What's there to talk about?

38:54.480 --> 38:58.963
- I'm sorry that I lied to you.
- I don't care that you lied. Really.

39:01.040 --> 39:04.328
Okay, I'm confused.
Why are you being like this?

39:04.520 --> 39:07.091
Because you were right, Elena.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.527
You wanted to protect me
so I wouldn't spiral.

39:09.720 --> 39:13.566
Because if I spiraled, then it would prove
that we shouldn't be together.

39:15.360 --> 39:16.805
But I didn't spiral.

39:17.040 --> 39:20.522
Despite every nerve in my body wanting
to break something or hurt someone...

39:20.720 --> 39:23.041
or do all the wrong things
for all the right reasons...

39:23.240 --> 39:25.561
I'm holding it together
the best I can...

39:27.160 --> 39:29.162
for you.

39:33.840 --> 39:36.844
- But you're still mad at me.
- Of course I'm still mad at you.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.691
Because being around you drives me nuts.

39:42.880 --> 39:47.204
And not being around you drives me nuts.

39:49.840 --> 39:51.888
Okay, now I'm really confused.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.963
What was that for?

40:17.320 --> 40:21.644
Because I've had a really crappy day.

40:22.360 --> 40:23.885
And I needed it.
