One's talking to those freaks who tried
to push us their personality tests.

02:40.287 --> 02:42.847
Look at that bloody
New Wellness loony.

02:42.887 --> 02:45.765
You know what would be
fucking funny? Us in there.

02:45.807 --> 02:49.322
We should do their test. Take a weirdo
for a ride round the paddock.

02:49.367 --> 02:50.482
Freak out the freaks.

02:52.847 --> 02:54.803

a few questions to determine

how you're being prevented from
unlocking your true potential.

03:09.047 --> 03:10.799
Oh, OK.

'I'll tell you what's unlocking
your true potential, mate. That tie! '

03:14.287 --> 03:16.437
Right, question one.

03:16.487 --> 03:21.163
Do you often make efforts to make people
you're not fond of laugh or smile?

03:21.207 --> 03:23.243
'I'll fuck with him. ' No.

03:23.287 --> 03:25.517
'Actually, it's more of a yes. '

crack wise to help yourself fit in?

03:29.007 --> 03:31.043
No. I mean yes.

03:31.087 --> 03:35.239
But... No, no.
It's a no. The answer's no.

03:35.287 --> 03:36.720
'What was my plan again? '

03:36.767 --> 03:41.477
Great! You know, a lot of
different people come and do the test,

03:41.527 --> 03:44.166

is that they're not

03:44.207 --> 03:46.596

03:53.487 --> 03:55.159

their roots in childhood.

his dad if he'd had the courage?

04:10.007 --> 04:12.157
Dunno. Just...

04:14.727 --> 04:16.125
Don't go?

04:17.607 --> 04:19.120

05:04.607 --> 05:08.156
Well, I used to have a Paladin Vardor
in Dungeons and Dragons.

05:08.207 --> 05:10.118
- What level?
- 14.

05:10.167 --> 05:12.203
- Nice.
- But I've never done Warquest,

05:12.247 --> 05:14.442

I'm sorry to bother you at work.
I wanted to apologise.

05:30.087 --> 05:32.442
I take and take
and never give anything back.

05:32.487 --> 05:34.603
Yes, that's right. Are you OK, Jez?

05:34.647 --> 05:38.162
Yes, I'm fine. I just need you to know
that I'm selfish and irresponsible.

05:38.207 --> 05:41.199
- I need to take ownership of that fact.
- 'OK, agreed. '

05:41.247 --> 05:44.364
- Are you sure you're OK?
- Yep, doing good.

or watched a whole Jeremy Kyle. '

05:50.767 --> 05:54.203

Warquest together some time.

role-play down Chislehurst, boss?

06:40.167 --> 06:43.477
Well, I'm up for it
if Dobby's up for it.

06:43.527 --> 06:47.406

Go to the fair and
buy some... gooseberries.

07:01.287 --> 07:05.439

07:27.327 --> 07:28.806
The kitchen. See you later.

07:28.847 --> 07:31.680

Are you OK? Is everything all right?

07:43.007 --> 07:44.884
Yeah, it's for personal
and career development.

07:44.927 --> 07:46.406
Did the first day yesterday.

07:46.447 --> 07:48.358
Best 400 quid I've ever spent.

07:48.407 --> 07:50.557
Plus, you get a free book.

07:52.287 --> 07:54.801
The New Wellness Centre.

07:54.847 --> 07:57.407
Jez, I think I've
heard about these people.

07:57.447 --> 07:59.483
There's stuff all over the internet
about them.

07:59.527 --> 08:01.802
That's right.
There's a conspiracy about them.

08:01.847 --> 08:05.635
There's a lot of stuff
about an asteroid in here.

08:05.687 --> 08:08.485
It's based on the seven sacred truths
from the golden tablets

08:08.527 --> 08:11.405
found in the asteroid
which crashed in Siberia in 1911.

08:11.447 --> 08:14.519
It's a really great book.
You'd love the chapter on orgones.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.285
Orgones?

08:16.327 --> 08:19.125
Orgones are the invisible molecules
of universal life energy

08:19.167 --> 08:22.239
which govern our moods and our actions.
Negatives orgones are the source

08:22.287 --> 08:25.085
- of all the problems in the world.
- And you believe that?

08:25.127 --> 08:28.483
Well, how do you explain
all the problems in the world?

08:28.527 --> 08:30.199
I mean, I couldn't just...

08:30.247 --> 08:33.842
There are so many historical
and economic factors...

08:33.886 --> 08:35.878
Exactly! You haven't got a clue.

08:37.447 --> 08:39.278
Come on, Jez. Asteroids?

08:39.327 --> 08:44.526
Orgones? What would you say if I came
home talking about that kind of stuff?

08:44.567 --> 08:49.083
I'd say, "That sounds fascinating,
please tell me more. " See you later.

08:49.127 --> 08:51.163
'Jeremy's in a cult.

08:51.207 --> 08:54.961
'Jeremy in a cult...
It does have a certain ring to it. '

08:57.767 --> 08:59.723
So, Sue's off.

08:59.767 --> 09:03.396
Yep. Some redundancies
are more voluntary than others, eh?

09:03.447 --> 09:04.675
She's taking it well.

and I'll show you a loser.

09:06.967 --> 09:12.678
So, listen, that new office of yours,
I think it's time we busted its virginity.

09:12.727 --> 09:15.400
'He's not gonna hump me
in my office, is he? '

09:15.447 --> 09:17.165
Marketing's a petrified forest.

09:17.207 --> 09:19.926
I need you to swing your chopper.
Is that OK, Corrigan?

09:19.967 --> 09:21.639
Sure thing, Alan.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.565
'Oh, God, firing people.

- Hey, husband.

09:30.087 --> 09:31.759
Hi, Soph, how are you doing?

09:31.807 --> 09:34.446
Pretty terrible.
This wine is so disgusting.

09:34.487 --> 09:36.842
Yep, it's very horrible.

09:36.887 --> 09:39.162
So, how's Jez?

09:39.207 --> 09:41.562
He's joined a cult,
is changing his name, but fine.

09:41.607 --> 09:43.359
Wow! What's his new name?

09:43.407 --> 09:44.237
Jared.

09:44.287 --> 09:46.881
- Ooh, that's not good.
- I know.

09:46.927 --> 09:49.760
So, you had a look
at the annulment stuff?

09:49.807 --> 09:52.196
Wanna go to your new office in a bit

09:52.247 --> 09:54.283
and annul the hell
out of our marriage?

09:54.327 --> 09:56.602
'Quick divorce, back for nibbles. '

09:58.407 --> 10:02.241
So... how are things?
What happened to whatshisname? Tolly?

10:02.287 --> 10:04.596
Oh, no good.

10:04.647 --> 10:06.763
I waited until about the fifth weekend

10:06.807 --> 10:11.039
and then I said, "Look, I want a baby,
like, pretty fucking soon."

10:11.087 --> 10:14.159
Then he said, "Oh, that's interesting."
And then, boom! Gone.

10:14.207 --> 10:18.086
Men don't like babies as much as women.
That's my analysis.

10:18.127 --> 10:21.961
How are things for you?
Missing me? Got anything going?

10:22.007 --> 10:25.636
Well, you know, I have got...
someone in the crosshairs.

10:25.687 --> 10:30.124
But I might let her live a bit longer
before I pull the trigger, though.

10:30.167 --> 10:33.125
Are you, though? Missing me?

10:33.167 --> 10:36.364
Yeah, well, I... I probably do miss you.

10:37.407 --> 10:40.080
A bit. 'She's playing me like a tuba. '

10:40.127 --> 10:42.038
I mean, I miss you a bit. So...

10:42.087 --> 10:43.998
'Should I?

10:44.047 --> 10:48.916
'I could. I haven't made my move

'Yeah, I'm Trump,
in my dirty wiggy tower. '

10:58.647 --> 11:02.560
'Look at me. Drunken one-night stand.

11:02.607 --> 11:04.802
'I mean, she is my wife.

11:04.847 --> 11:08.556
'Still, finally got to use my
Bachelor's Emergency Condom.

11:08.607 --> 11:11.041
'Oh, shit! Oh, bollocks! '

11:12.527 --> 11:16.440
Soph... I think there might be
a bit of a problem.

11:16.487 --> 11:18.478
It's not...

11:18.527 --> 11:22.122
It's been in my wallet so long
I think the rubber may have perished.

11:22.167 --> 11:26.240
Old Meg has broken.
Oh, God, Soph, I'm sorry.

11:26.287 --> 11:27.800
It's broken?

11:27.847 --> 11:29.200
Oh dear.

11:29.247 --> 11:31.317
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

11:31.367 --> 11:37.522
I suppose, just to be on the safe side,
the morning-after pill. You could...

11:37.567 --> 11:42.277
Maybe. There's powerful hormones
in those things, so I might just...

11:42.327 --> 11:43.806
What?

11:43.847 --> 11:47.556
Let nature take its course. The chances
are, on a one-off, nothing's...

11:47.607 --> 11:49.723
Soph,
why are you sitting like that?

11:49.767 --> 11:51.644
- Like what?
- Like that.

11:51.687 --> 11:52.836
It's comfy.

11:52.887 --> 11:55.720
It's just...
Sitting like that, it might...

11:55.767 --> 11:57.405
I like sitting like this.

11:57.447 --> 11:58.880
Stop sitting like that.

11:58.927 --> 12:00.406
No.

12:00.447 --> 12:01.846
Please. Sit up.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.959
Just relax. OK?
I'm not going to sit up. I'm just comfy.

12:05.007 --> 12:07.680
'That is low. That is really low.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.002
'She's taken my sperm

12:10.047 --> 12:12.720
'and sperm is like lending someone
less than a fiver.

12:12.767 --> 12:14.644
'You can't really ask for it back. '

12:14.687 --> 12:19.715
The good news is that in my
last personality chart I was 30% up,

12:19.767 --> 12:21.485
which was pretty wicked.

12:21.527 --> 12:24.405
Your wellness levels must
be through the fucking roof.

12:24.447 --> 12:26.961
You're right on schedule,
according to the book.

12:27.007 --> 12:30.204
Hardback book, based on tablets
brought by an asteroid.

12:30.247 --> 12:31.600
Something you can rely on.

12:31.647 --> 12:36.596
Yeah. What do you think about
the asteroids stuff?

12:36.647 --> 12:38.399
Are you having a few doubts?

12:38.447 --> 12:43.123
- No. God no. More sort of... thoughts.
- Thoughts?

12:43.167 --> 12:45.203
You want to give that shit a rest.

12:45.247 --> 12:48.239
You've been thinking thoughts your
whole life. Look where that got you.

12:48.287 --> 12:49.686
True enough.

12:49.727 --> 12:54.881
I was talking to Pascoe and a couple
of rooms have come up at the centre.

12:54.927 --> 12:57.316
The cool thing is, if you live in,

12:57.367 --> 13:01.918
you can pay for classes by making
new recruits. It's a good system, innit?

13:01.967 --> 13:03.685
<i>That is a good system.</i>

13:03.727 --> 13:06.685
So? You up for it?

13:06.727 --> 13:09.924
'Move into the compound?
Mark'll say I'm joining a cult.

13:09.967 --> 13:13.755
'But he won't have a Nectar card because
he thinks it means they've got him! '

13:13.807 --> 13:17.800
Dude, crank up the orgonometer
and bring on module two!

13:21.367 --> 13:23.358
'Hope she's not pregnant.

13:23.407 --> 13:25.398
'It's been ages.
She hasn't mentioned it.

13:25.447 --> 13:29.645
'She won't be pregnant. It's not like
I'm a Royal Marine with super sperm. '

13:29.687 --> 13:32.042
Oh! Hi, Alan.

13:32.087 --> 13:34.317
Looking good in here.

13:34.367 --> 13:36.642
I've got a 32-inch plasma in mine.

13:36.687 --> 13:38.757
You get a document up on that baby

13:38.807 --> 13:41.958
and you are
seriously looking at that document.

13:42.007 --> 13:45.443
These are the figures from human
resources. The droid for the chop.

13:45.487 --> 13:47.796
Sophie is the lowest-ranked by far, so...

13:47.847 --> 13:49.678
Sophie?

13:49.727 --> 13:51.877
You want me to fire Sophie?

13:51.927 --> 13:55.522
She's a liability. She came in late this
morning, stinking of booze and fags.

13:55.567 --> 13:57.797
<i>'She's so unpregnated. '</i>

13:57.847 --> 14:01.123
I'm not running a rehab clinic. This is
a maximum-security business institution

14:01.167 --> 14:04.318
and if you can't break rocks,
you get shot in the head.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.164
Do your duty, Corrigan.

14:06.207 --> 14:07.799
Chapman! Corrigan.

14:11.967 --> 14:13.958
You wanted to see me?

14:14.007 --> 14:17.522
Um, yes, take... take a seat.

14:17.567 --> 14:20.525
'Oh fuck! Oh fuck! Oh fuck! '

14:20.567 --> 14:23.365
Um... Yes, there's...
There's something I want...

14:23.407 --> 14:27.161
<i>Well, I don't want,
but I've got to tell you.</i>

14:27.207 --> 14:30.677
Yes. And I've actually...
I've got some news. Big news.

14:30.727 --> 14:33.321
Oh, yes?
'Please don't say you're pregnant. '

14:33.367 --> 14:35.085
I'm pregnant.

14:35.127 --> 14:37.197
'Fu-u-u-uck! '

14:37.247 --> 14:39.363
Right. You're pregnant.

14:39.407 --> 14:41.125
Of course.

14:41.167 --> 14:44.204
I did three home tests last night
and they were all positive.

14:44.247 --> 14:45.726
Right. Only three?

14:45.767 --> 14:49.203
Look, I know neither of us planned this.
But it's happened.

14:49.247 --> 14:51.397
And I want a baby.

14:55.887 --> 14:58.560
- So, what was your news?
- Well, um...

14:59.687 --> 15:04.602
Have you ever considered, you know,
redundancy? Voluntary redundancy?

15:04.647 --> 15:05.875
No.

15:05.927 --> 15:09.681
Have you ever considered
involuntary redundancy?

15:11.487 --> 15:12.681
You're firing me?

15:12.727 --> 15:17.243
Well, no, I mean...
I've been asked to fire you,

15:17.287 --> 15:18.640
but that doesn't necessarily mean...

15:18.687 --> 15:20.439
That's perfect.
That's just what I needed.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.763
I've just found out I'm pregnant
and now I'm losing my fucking job.

15:23.807 --> 15:27.197
Mark! I don't think I'm going to
be able to cope with this.

15:27.247 --> 15:30.159
'Oh, fiddlesticks.
Of course, I'm having a baby.

15:30.207 --> 15:31.925
'Great. I'll probably drop it

15:31.967 --> 15:35.004
'or it'll write a bitter memoir about
how distant I was. '

15:35.047 --> 15:36.241
Sorry!

15:36.287 --> 15:39.518
Look. Sophie, I'm...
I'm not going to fire you.

15:39.567 --> 15:44.004
We'll sort something out.
I'll fire someone else.

15:44.047 --> 15:46.038
Paul, he's a pain in the arse.

15:46.087 --> 15:48.521
That would be nice.

15:48.567 --> 15:50.239
'Please stop crying. '

15:50.287 --> 15:54.644
And... and... I just want to say that
I'll be there for you.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.325
I'm going to look after you

15:56.367 --> 16:00.963
and I'll cook you meals
and wash your clothes and...

16:01.007 --> 16:02.406
'Still crying! '

16:02.447 --> 16:06.804
If you want, I'll be there for you 24/7.

16:06.847 --> 16:09.486
Really? Would you do that?

16:09.527 --> 16:11.722
Absolutely.

16:11.767 --> 16:13.678
'Just got to say the right words.

16:13.727 --> 16:15.638
'Can think about what they mean later. '

16:17.247 --> 16:20.239
Broadsword plus two.
Broadsword plus two!

16:20.287 --> 16:22.084
Reviving potion, reviving potion.

16:22.127 --> 16:25.119
- You're down! You're fucking down.
- I revived, all right, I revived.

16:25.167 --> 16:30.366
'What they fuck am I doing? I'm in
a wood in Kent with a plastic sword.

16:30.407 --> 16:33.683
'I've crossed a line.
I'm an executive and a father-to-be.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.287
'This isn't me. These aren't my people. '

16:36.327 --> 16:39.399
Barbarians! Move out. Prepare a feast.

16:41.127 --> 16:45.598
Coming to the pub, Mark? Cheap lager,
expensive crisps and self-loathing?

16:45.647 --> 16:47.763
'She's The One, definitely. '

16:47.807 --> 16:51.083
I could give you a lift home?

16:51.127 --> 16:55.723
I... I think I'll jump in the van.
I need to get home.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.997
- Sophie asked me to come over.
- Right.

16:58.047 --> 16:59.765
Pub, Gerard?

16:59.807 --> 17:01.365
Sure.

17:01.407 --> 17:04.637
'There she goes. Goodbye, Dobby,

17:04.686 --> 17:07.838
'because I'm having a baby with a woman
who secretly hates me.

17:07.887 --> 17:10.799
'Don't want to mess up
that sweet little deal. '

17:10.847 --> 17:14.237
So, listen, Mark. Something
I wanted to mention... about Dobby.

17:14.287 --> 17:19.759
Cos I know you two had a bit of a thing,
but I'm thinking about asking her out.

17:19.807 --> 17:23.720
Actually, Gerard, there's been something
I've been meaning to mention, too.

17:23.767 --> 17:25.325
Yeah?

17:25.367 --> 17:27.243
You're fired.

17:27.287 --> 17:28.481
What?

17:28.527 --> 17:32.566
- From JLB. You're fired from your job.
- This is about Dobby, isn't it?

17:32.607 --> 17:35.599
Absolutely not.
You're just not pulling your weight.

17:35.647 --> 17:38.605
You're scared to make a move
and want me out of the way!

17:38.647 --> 17:40.285
That is simply not true.

17:40.327 --> 17:43.444
If you fire me, I'll tell everyone
it's because of Dobby.

17:43.487 --> 17:46.604
I'll take you to a tribunal.
I will go all the way.

17:46.647 --> 17:50.799
OK, well, maybe I have been
a bit... hasty.

17:50.847 --> 17:54.999
Your work is showing signs
of improvement in some areas so...

17:55.047 --> 17:57.686
Very well, after this talk,

17:57.727 --> 17:59.604
you're not fired.

18:01.087 --> 18:02.281
Satisfied?

18:02.327 --> 18:04.557
'Oh, my God! I can't fire anyone.

18:04.607 --> 18:07.075
'I'm like British Leyland in 1976.'

18:08.887 --> 18:13.961
'Hmm. A new TV and it's HD ready.

18:14.007 --> 18:16.601
I am so ready for HD.

18:16.647 --> 18:18.877
'HD will make everything better.

18:18.927 --> 18:22.715
Hello. Do you want any of this stuff
before I drive it down the incinerator?

18:22.767 --> 18:24.325
What is it?

18:24.367 --> 18:26.278
Jared's old shit.

18:26.327 --> 18:29.876
Photos, songs, diaries,
love letters, that sort of crap.

18:29.927 --> 18:32.805
Oh, yeah, sure,

18:32.847 --> 18:34.405
I'll... I'll hang onto that.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.286
So...

18:38.327 --> 18:43.765
Is he really actually going?
To the centre?

18:43.807 --> 18:46.401
Yep. Sophie's in there now
saying goodbye.

18:46.447 --> 18:50.725
'She's nice.
Maybe it'll be OK with me and Soph.

18:50.767 --> 18:52.041
'A quick game of Warquest.

18:52.087 --> 18:56.558
'When you have a baby, probably any
relationship issues just melt away. '

18:56.607 --> 18:58.086
So, yeah, Jez.

18:58.127 --> 18:59.480
Jared.

18:59.527 --> 19:01.245
I wanted a quick chat.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.926
- You're not trying to de-programme me? -
No, not at all.

19:03.967 --> 19:08.279
You remember that time
when I came over last month

19:08.327 --> 19:10.557
to give Mark the annulment papers?

19:10.607 --> 19:12.120
What? When we...

19:13.327 --> 19:15.887
did the thing
that we shouldn't have done

19:15.927 --> 19:19.317
but which, at the time,
we really, really wanted to do?

19:19.367 --> 19:20.641
Yeah.

19:20.687 --> 19:24.646
Yeah. I don't feel great about that.
I don't really want to do that again.

19:24.687 --> 19:27.884
No, nor me! Um, no, it's just, um...

19:28.807 --> 19:31.196
You know I went to the clinic and I'm...

19:31.247 --> 19:34.205
- Knocked up with Mark's kid?
- Pregnant, yeah.

19:34.247 --> 19:36.363
Well, it turns out the dates...

19:36.407 --> 19:39.843
the dates might be a bit wrong
for what I thought, so...

19:39.887 --> 19:41.400
So, what?

19:41.447 --> 19:44.757
It's not going to get born... old?

19:46.207 --> 19:48.767
Or young?
But they come young anyway, so...

19:48.807 --> 19:50.001
No.

19:50.047 --> 19:53.164
I got the dates a bit wrong, so...

19:55.607 --> 19:57.359
Oh, you're fucking kidding.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.005
Oh, no!

20:00.047 --> 20:01.605
No!

20:01.647 --> 20:03.922
So I don't know. It's all up in the air.

20:03.967 --> 20:08.995
Yeah... It's exciting.
I'm glad you told me.

20:09.047 --> 20:12.198
'I so wish you hadn't told me.
Everything was brilliant before I knew

20:12.247 --> 20:14.841
<i>'and I was joining the cult...
Not cult. '</i>

20:14.887 --> 20:17.685
So, with everything we've been through,

20:17.727 --> 20:20.924
I just don't think I can tell Mark.
Will you tell him?

20:20.967 --> 20:23.481
Of course I will, Soph.

20:23.527 --> 20:24.880
I'll keep in touch.

20:24.927 --> 20:30.684
'I'll send Mark a note. A nice card with
a stork and a love rat. And a fiver. '

20:30.727 --> 20:33.924
Bye, Mark. See you soon, I hope.

20:33.967 --> 20:35.798
Um, yeah. See you.

20:35.847 --> 20:40.318
'Could text him.
A friendly, anonymous text. '

20:40.367 --> 20:42.562
So... this is exciting.

20:42.607 --> 20:44.563
I'm moving into the centre

20:44.607 --> 20:48.236
and you're going to have
your wife and your family.

20:48.287 --> 20:49.640
Yeah.

20:49.687 --> 20:52.804
The Dobby door is definitely closed.

20:52.847 --> 20:55.281
I waited too long.
Her and Gerard are an item.

20:55.327 --> 21:00.003
Uh-huh. 'Should tell him.
God, I feel terrible.

21:00.047 --> 21:03.164
'Where they heck did all these
negative orgones come from? '

21:03.207 --> 21:04.765
OK, well, um...

21:06.007 --> 21:07.326
Bye.

21:09.807 --> 21:11.286
Ey-ey!

21:12.367 --> 21:14.403
Uhhh-uhhh!

21:21.727 --> 21:24.525
There was just one thing.

21:24.567 --> 21:27.684
I don't think you should go,
you do know that, don't you?

21:27.727 --> 21:32.323
I'll come and get you if you like.
I'll happily de-programme you.

21:32.367 --> 21:34.198
Yeah, thanks, man.

21:34.247 --> 21:37.205
Um... No, the thing is... It's just...

21:37.247 --> 21:40.000
Um... Pfff-fff...

21:40.047 --> 21:42.800
Me and Sophie
might be having a baby.

21:42.847 --> 21:46.601
No, Jez, me and Sophie
might be having a baby.

21:46.647 --> 21:51.437
No, Mark. Me and Sophie
might be having a baby.

21:51.487 --> 21:54.399
About a month ago,
when she came round,

21:54.447 --> 21:56.244
we ended up...

21:56.287 --> 21:58.721
Oh, my God! I knew it!

21:58.767 --> 22:02.362
<i>Everyone is secretly
fucking behind my back!</i>

22:02.407 --> 22:03.522
I'm so sorry.

22:03.567 --> 22:06.604
But it's not for certain.
It might still be yours.

22:06.647 --> 22:10.117
Brilliant! I won't throw away
my ticket in the baby raffle just yet!

22:10.167 --> 22:13.477
- Are you angry?
- You had sex with my wife, Jeremy!

22:13.527 --> 22:15.995
That's quite a number, even for you!

22:16.047 --> 22:20.837
But, then, on the other hand,
I was definitely having a baby which,

22:20.887 --> 22:24.436
to be honest, wasn't really on
my to-do list for the year.

22:24.487 --> 22:26.796
So, in a way, things are looking up.

22:26.847 --> 22:28.678
Right.

22:28.727 --> 22:30.604
It's such a relief to tell you.

22:30.647 --> 22:33.366
God, it's been ever so weird,
ever since it happened.

22:33.407 --> 22:38.481
I've had this really bad feeling,
like, in my brain, and...

22:38.527 --> 22:42.281
It's guilt, Jeremy. Most people feel it
when they've done something wrong.

22:42.327 --> 22:45.444
This is why you've become a cult-head,
isn't it?

22:45.487 --> 22:47.079
What? Oh, God, no.

22:47.127 --> 22:50.836
No, it's a much bigger journey
than that.

22:50.887 --> 22:53.720
Although, I did join up
the day after it happened.

22:53.767 --> 22:55.883
'Do the maths, Jeremy. '

22:55.927 --> 23:01.047
Oh, Jared, what's the hold-up, dude?
The incinerator closes at six.

23:01.087 --> 23:05.399
Um, sure. It's just...
I've been having a talk with Mark

23:05.447 --> 23:09.838
and, um, basically I might have
a big think about the move.

23:09.887 --> 23:13.004
You having thoughts again?
I've told you about that shit.

23:13.047 --> 23:17.199
He's not moving into the compound.
We don't need any of your orgones here,

23:17.247 --> 23:20.444
Super Hans.
He's staying where he belongs.

23:20.487 --> 23:24.162
You're gonna stay in the Death Star with
Captain Haddock? He doesn't value you.

23:24.207 --> 23:26.926
- He thinks you're a dickhead.
- Just because he's a dickhead

23:26.967 --> 23:29.037
doesn't mean I'm not his friend.

23:29.087 --> 23:32.284
He may be a dickhead but I'm
showing him how to stop being one.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.637
Could you please stop agreeing that
I'm a dickhead! I'm not a dickhead.

23:35.687 --> 23:39.236
Look, dickhead or not,
he belongs here, in the real world.

23:39.287 --> 23:41.243
You think this is the real world?

23:41.287 --> 23:44.438
The elves and the pixies
and fucking Merlin?

23:44.487 --> 23:49.163
Well, it's better than asteroids
and tablets and orgones.

23:49.207 --> 23:50.925
Whoops!

23:50.967 --> 23:52.844
Right, you fucker.

23:54.567 --> 23:56.444
No! Stop!

23:57.047 --> 24:00.244
No, Super Hans, not the new TV.

24:00.287 --> 24:03.518
It's bullshit. It's just a meaningless
object of attachment.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.046
Yeah, but it's HD ready!

24:05.087 --> 24:06.645
It's HD ready!

24:06.687 --> 24:07.403
Hans! No!

24:12.967 --> 24:14.161
Whoops!

24:14.207 --> 24:17.677
Right! That is it, Hans!
Fuck off, just fuck off, all right?

24:17.727 --> 24:19.718
All right...

24:19.767 --> 24:23.680
Stay and watch your negative orgone level
hit the fucking roof if you want.

24:23.727 --> 24:25.479
I'm going clear.

24:25.527 --> 24:27.995
'Oh, God, he's broken a TV.

24:28.047 --> 24:31.403
'I might be a father...
He's broken a TV! '

24:31.447 --> 24:34.405
Jesus, man, I am so sorry.

24:34.447 --> 24:37.883
Don't worry, Home insurance, my friend.

24:37.927 --> 24:40.805
Finally, it's payback time.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.883
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:42.927 --> 24:45.964
We'll get a new telly,
even bigger than this one.

24:46.007 --> 24:49.920
And... what about the... issue?

24:49.967 --> 24:53.243
Well, if Sophie continues
down her path towards self destruction,

24:53.287 --> 24:56.597
we'll end up adopting
like a couple of gay dads, anyway.

24:56.647 --> 24:59.719
- We won't need to find out whose it is.
- Right.

24:59.767 --> 25:03.203
Who knows? Who the fuck even cares?

25:03.247 --> 25:04.600
Exactly.

25:04.647 --> 25:05.762
'Oh, Jesus. '

25:05.807 --> 25:07.559
'Oh, Jesus. '

25:15.447 --> 25:17.085
<i>Paranoia, paranoia</i>

25:17.127 --> 25:20.278
<i>Everybody's coming to get me</i>

25:20.327 --> 25:23.319
<i>Just say you never met me</i>

25:23.367 --> 25:26.359
<i>I'm runnin' underground with the moles</i>

25:26.407 --> 25:28.204
<i>Diggin' holes</i>
