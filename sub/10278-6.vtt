E. R.

00:06.897 --> 00:08.412
Previously on E. R.

00:08.413 --> 00:10.936
...take a look here,
you'll see numerous fractures...

00:10.971 --> 00:12.959
...consistent with
repetitive blunt trauma.

00:12.960 --> 00:14.177
I know how he died.

00:14.178 --> 00:17.013
- He's a teenager. It's normal stuff.
- No, he's changed.

00:17.014 --> 00:19.048
You're just not around enough
to notice anymore.

00:19.049 --> 00:20.954
I'm not doing anything, all right?

00:21.638 --> 00:24.668
It's just...
I'm a man, you know?

00:25.187 --> 00:26.891
And my folks just can't get
used to it.

00:26.892 --> 00:29.196
Sometimes you gotta do
what you don't wanna do.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.414
That's part of being a man.

00:32.131 --> 00:36.475
- Luka, this is grounds for dismissal.
- Fine, Kerry. Fire me.

01:02.837 --> 01:05.458
Dr. Kovac.

01:08.007 --> 01:09.631
We couldn't find the left arm.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.255
- BP's 100/60.
- Pulse 120.

01:12.427 --> 01:16.922
Sir, you're gonna have to settle down!
Settle down!

01:17.097 --> 01:18.176
Fluids in the field?

01:18.348 --> 01:20.838
Bolused a liter of saline
and gave him 10 of morphine.

01:21.016 --> 01:24.017
Okay, now.
Get another IV going.

01:24.185 --> 01:28.348
Pre-op labs, serial crits, type and cross
times four. Who's on for Trauma?

01:28.522 --> 01:30.929
- Benton's on at 7.
- Okay, see if he is here yet.

01:31.107 --> 01:33.064
I don't have a hand!
Where's my hand?!

01:33.233 --> 01:35.439
- Titrate another 10 of morphine.
- Can't get a line.

01:35.610 --> 01:38.527
- Sir, you've gotta calm down!
- Man, that's gotta hurt.

01:38.988 --> 01:41.656
- I don't have a hand!
- Somebody won't be playing flute.

01:41.823 --> 01:43.945
- That bastard shot me!
- With what? A howitzer?

01:44.116 --> 01:47.152
- Shotgun, point-blank range.
- Let's page Ortho. Let's get an O.R.

01:47.327 --> 01:48.406
I need my hand!

01:48.578 --> 01:51.150
I found it, but I don't know
what you're gonna sew it to.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.322
- Settle down.
- Get some restraints.

01:53.498 --> 01:56.581
Out on the corner of Madison
and Pulaski, 6:30 a. m., selling rock.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.075
You've got a regular pharmacy
down here, don't you?

01:59.252 --> 02:00.911
- My hand!
- And a gun.

02:01.086 --> 02:04.371
- Selling drugs is dangerous.
- Malucci, get over here.

02:04.547 --> 02:07.382
- Do you have this now?
- Yeah, go.

02:07.549 --> 02:10.882
All right. Deflate the BP cuff.

02:13.470 --> 02:16.174
I had a tough week with my kid.

02:16.347 --> 02:19.431
He's 14 and he's been getting high.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.888
It's tough for me to lecture him.

02:22.060 --> 02:24.431
He knows I'm sober now...

02:24.603 --> 02:27.936
...but it was only two years ago
I was high all the time.

02:28.106 --> 02:31.189
Now when I try to talk to him,
he just walks away...

02:31.358 --> 02:37.229
...or he screams at me. Tells me
I have no right to talk to him about it.

02:37.404 --> 02:42.693
I think he's probably right, you know,
after all I put them through.

02:42.866 --> 02:45.356
Hey, I got the perfect plan
for killing off Romano.

02:45.534 --> 02:47.989
We wrap the hand around the gun,
pull the trigger...

02:48.161 --> 02:49.869
...it's got this guy's prints on it.

02:50.038 --> 02:51.318
Put down the hand, Malucci.

02:51.497 --> 02:53.536
When do we get another
opportunity like this?

02:53.707 --> 02:55.533
Put down the damn hand.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.159
When there's a patient on the table,
I want respect, all right?

02:59.336 --> 03:03.035
- Respect for the patient and for me.
- Respect for a drug-dealing banger?

03:03.214 --> 03:05.786
The only thing I want to hear
from you is the medicine.

03:05.966 --> 03:08.254
You say so, Pete.

03:08.801 --> 03:12.133
When you're addressing me, it's:
"Yes, Dr. Benton. No, Dr. Benton. "

03:12.303 --> 03:14.177
Are we clear?

03:20.643 --> 03:23.394
- Hey, Brian. Sign my card?
- Yeah.

03:23.895 --> 03:26.219
- There you go.
- Thanks.

03:26.397 --> 03:29.681
- You were doing a crossword.
- I was listening.

03:29.857 --> 03:31.849
You know, this isn't my first meeting.

03:32.026 --> 03:35.061
- I had months of this in rehab.
- When's the last time you shared?

03:35.236 --> 03:37.809
- I'll get up tomorrow.
- There are other meetings.

03:37.988 --> 03:39.565
You're right. I'll share tomorrow.

03:39.739 --> 03:42.739
I used to go to one at Saint Michael's.
It had more addicts.

03:42.908 --> 03:45.031
I like this one. It's convenient.

03:45.202 --> 03:47.906
I thought you might feel more
comfortable around NA people.

03:48.079 --> 03:51.114
I go to meetings, I take my meds,
I pee in cups when they ask.

03:51.289 --> 03:53.614
If you want me to get up and share,
I'll do that.

03:53.791 --> 03:55.949
I'll do it tomorrow.

03:58.878 --> 04:00.787
E. R.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.585
- Hey.
- Hi.

05:02.756 --> 05:05.875
- Busy night?
- Not bad.

05:06.217 --> 05:07.877
Any messy leftovers?

05:08.385 --> 05:11.718
There's a hypersexual dementia guy
in Curtain 3. He's fast.

05:11.888 --> 05:14.176
Thanks for the warning.

05:15.223 --> 05:19.054
Hey, you and Kovac still going out?

05:22.062 --> 05:24.469
Not many secrets down here, huh?

05:24.772 --> 05:26.978
No.

05:27.149 --> 05:29.306
Is he doing okay?

05:29.525 --> 05:32.893
It's just he seems a little off.

05:33.653 --> 05:35.645
I'm sure he's fine.

05:35.821 --> 05:37.564
Good. See you later.

05:37.739 --> 05:38.902
Bye.

05:40.199 --> 05:42.238
I always hate mornings like this.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.236
Good and slow.
Just the way I like them.

05:44.411 --> 05:45.739
Calm before the storm?

05:45.912 --> 05:48.698
Always means it'll get crazy
before the end of your shift.

05:48.872 --> 05:51.113
Hey, Frank. Call Security.

05:51.291 --> 05:54.326
- Mike passed out in the linen room again.
- Mad Mike? He's back?

05:54.501 --> 05:56.292
Back and unbelievably stinky.

05:56.461 --> 05:59.710
No need for Security. I threw him
out of there twice yesterday.

05:59.880 --> 06:04.457
And tell Housekeeping
to keep that damn door locked.

06:04.633 --> 06:05.796
Frank, what do you got?

06:05.968 --> 06:08.256
A little homeless helper.
It speeds things along.

06:08.428 --> 06:10.301
- Give me that.
- I'm not gonna hit him.

06:10.471 --> 06:12.379
Give me it.

06:13.390 --> 06:15.014
Kerry, remember I'm off today at 6.

06:15.182 --> 06:17.507
How could I forget?
You mentioned it three times.

06:17.684 --> 06:19.925
Well, actually just two, counting now.

06:20.103 --> 06:23.138
- Cutting school early today, Dr. Greene?
- It's on the schedule.

06:23.313 --> 06:25.352
Going to a professional conference,
I hope.

06:25.523 --> 06:27.266
No, a personal one.

06:27.441 --> 06:29.848
You and Lizzie going off
somewhere romantic again?

06:30.026 --> 06:32.861
- I put in the request weeks ago.
- No doubt.

06:33.028 --> 06:36.610
Frank, those films back
on my elbow lac? Where's Frank?

06:36.781 --> 06:38.856
- Out harassing the homeless.
- What?

06:39.033 --> 06:42.365
Old cop habits are hard to break.

06:43.619 --> 06:46.536
- Good morning.
- Hi.

06:46.705 --> 06:47.949
You wanna get some lunch?

06:48.122 --> 06:51.455
Kerry, paramedics have a 13-year-old.
Fell on her way to school.

06:51.625 --> 06:53.866
Okay. Luka, you take it.
Chuny, go with him.

06:54.043 --> 06:55.916
- Sure.
- Lunch?

06:56.086 --> 06:59.869
Yeah, sure. If there's time.

07:00.047 --> 07:03.297
Abby, page Corday. She might
have a herniated disk in 3.

07:03.467 --> 07:05.624
- Kerry...?
- Yeah, I know. 6.

07:05.802 --> 07:08.837
I should have grabbed a coat.
It'll be snowing again soon.

07:09.012 --> 07:13.472
Excuse me. Hi. Is this the way
to the ER? I'm just a little lost.

07:13.640 --> 07:16.095
This is the ambulance entrance.
Walk-ins are in front.

07:16.267 --> 07:19.386
A 13-year-old girl, ground-level fall,
oriented times three, no LOC.

07:19.561 --> 07:21.269
- I'm okay.
- The school called me.

07:21.438 --> 07:23.809
They wouldn't let her in class
until she got checked.

07:23.981 --> 07:26.056
- I'm fine, Dad. Really.
- What's her name?

07:26.233 --> 07:28.438
- Teresa.
- Did you pass out when you fell?

07:28.609 --> 07:30.566
- No.
- Around front, through the doors.

07:30.736 --> 07:32.775
- It's all right.
- Authorized personnel only.

07:32.946 --> 07:35.068
My daughter works here.

07:35.239 --> 07:37.030
- Excuse me. Hi.
- Hi.

07:37.199 --> 07:38.776
I'm Maggie. You are?

07:38.950 --> 07:40.741
Chuny. Your daughter works
in the ER?

07:40.910 --> 07:43.364
- Yes, she's a doctor.
- Frank, can you help this lady?

07:43.536 --> 07:45.825
- Just a minute.
- Come back later. I've got bagels.

07:45.997 --> 07:48.154
- Okay.
- I've got lots of them.

07:48.332 --> 07:51.166
Catch you sleeping there again,
I'll chain blocks to you...

07:51.334 --> 07:54.120
...and toss your worthless carcass
off Navy Pier!

07:54.294 --> 07:57.294
- Do you have any pain?
- No. I just wanna go back to school.

07:57.463 --> 08:00.167
Let the doctor check you out.
She loves school.

08:00.340 --> 08:03.340
- What grade are you in?
- Seventh. I'm missing a test.

08:03.717 --> 08:07.548
- Yeah. CBC, Chem-7 and UA.
- Something wrong with her neck?

08:07.720 --> 08:13.009
Just a precaution. She has some pain,
but it's probably nothing.

08:14.892 --> 08:16.765
Okay. This is gonna take
a few minutes.

08:16.935 --> 08:19.508
Mr. Ruiz, why don't you get
a cup of coffee?

08:19.687 --> 08:22.012
- I wanna stay with her.
- You can come right back.

08:22.189 --> 08:25.023
Deborah, will you show Mr. Ruiz
where the coffee machines are?

08:25.191 --> 08:28.606
- This way, sir.
- Honey, I'll be back in a minute.

08:28.818 --> 08:30.609
Sir.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.855
Any chance you're pregnant
before I get an x-ray?

08:37.198 --> 08:39.073
No.

08:39.868 --> 08:43.532
Do you have anyone you'd like
to designate as the adoptive parents?

08:43.703 --> 08:45.910
I need to find someone
to adopt my child?

08:46.081 --> 08:48.701
No. But a lot of women
already have someone in mind.

08:48.874 --> 08:51.032
A family member, an acquaintance.

08:51.209 --> 08:53.036
No. No one.

08:53.211 --> 08:55.452
Can I be candid?

08:56.880 --> 09:00.212
In my experience, it's very unusual
for a woman of Asian descent...

09:00.382 --> 09:03.418
...to offer a child up for adoption.

09:03.968 --> 09:07.502
We've found that most Asian women
end up changing their minds.

09:07.679 --> 09:10.632
Oftentimes at the last minute.

09:14.476 --> 09:18.009
Did you bring me out here just to make
sure I wouldn't change my mind?

09:18.187 --> 09:21.352
Lots of women never make it
past this bench.

09:21.522 --> 09:23.182
I can't keep this child.

09:23.565 --> 09:26.269
Have you discussed adoption
with your family?

09:26.442 --> 09:29.063
- No.
- You really should.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.027
And what about the father?

09:31.196 --> 09:34.730
Is he prepared to sign away
his parental rights?

09:35.407 --> 09:37.897
Does he know you're pregnant?

09:39.035 --> 09:42.070
Well, he may want to keep the baby.

09:42.370 --> 09:43.698
What if I don't want him to?

09:43.871 --> 09:47.405
He's the father. He has rights.

09:51.210 --> 09:52.289
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:52.461 --> 09:54.868
- Can I-?
- I'm making a fresh pot. Be ready in a sec.

09:55.046 --> 09:57.038
It's Kenyan, fresh-ground. Smell that.

09:57.214 --> 10:00.001
- Excuse me. Excuse me, who are you?
- Lord!

10:00.175 --> 10:03.128
Maggie Wyczenski. You want a bagel?
I've got lots of bagels.

10:03.302 --> 10:05.258
What kind would you like here?
Any kind.

10:05.428 --> 10:07.255
It's not ready yet. In a minute.

10:07.430 --> 10:09.054
- This area's for ER staff.
- Bagel?

10:09.223 --> 10:10.551
- Yeah.
- The area is for staff.

10:10.724 --> 10:14.507
- No. Raisin. You got raisin?
- Malik, go. Get out of here.

10:14.685 --> 10:18.551
- You are not supposed to be in here.
- Now, it's fine. Really.

10:18.729 --> 10:21.729
My daughter's a doctor here.
Abby Wyczenski-

10:21.898 --> 10:25.942
No. Lockhart, actually.
Abby Lockhart.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.066
I just heard this loud pop.

10:28.236 --> 10:30.358
How would you describe
the pain, Mr. Patterson?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.237
Al, please.

10:32.406 --> 10:35.192
Is the pain sharp or dull, Al?

10:35.366 --> 10:39.114
It's a bit of a bastard, really.
It's like a burning down my right leg.

10:39.286 --> 10:41.990
- Any numbness?
- Yeah, a bit.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.404
What were you doing
when you heard the pop?

10:44.581 --> 10:49.158
Surfing. I know I'm a bit old for it,
but I've been surfing all my life.

10:49.334 --> 10:52.667
- Is this tender?
- Oh, yes. Very.

10:53.462 --> 10:57.625
It's hard to give it up.
Have you ever paddled out yourself?

10:57.799 --> 10:59.174
Can't say I have.

10:59.341 --> 11:01.298
You were surfing Lake Michigan?

11:01.468 --> 11:05.251
No. Kauai. That's where I live.

11:06.680 --> 11:11.803
I'm in town
for the sportswear convention.

11:12.642 --> 11:15.097
Plane trip nearly killed me
with this back.

11:15.269 --> 11:17.806
Will you get me a safety pin, Abby?

11:18.730 --> 11:21.647
That's London, is it?
Just trying to pick the accent.

11:21.816 --> 11:25.100
Sussex. I went to London
for university. Yours?

11:25.276 --> 11:28.810
Zambia. Born and raised.
My father was a doctor.

11:29.029 --> 11:32.397
You're gonna feel a couple of pinpricks.
Tell me if they feel the same.

11:32.573 --> 11:33.818
- Abby.
- Yeah?

11:33.991 --> 11:35.105
Your mother's here.

11:35.283 --> 11:37.192
Duller on the right than on the left.

11:37.368 --> 11:40.072
- She's out front.
- Pull on my hand with your right foot.

11:40.245 --> 11:44.028
- No, she's not.
- Nice lady. Kind of a looker.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.285
- My mom's in Florida.
- Maybe she was.

11:49.460 --> 11:51.582
Now she's serving breakfast
out of Admit.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.627
Doesn't know you're back
to nursing.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.670
You two don't stay in touch, I guess.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.796
You know, he's flying in the air...

11:57.966 --> 12:00.172
That's not my mother.

12:00.343 --> 12:03.378
- Yeah.
- Like, 65 miles an hour. And the...

12:03.553 --> 12:06.388
I have no idea who that woman is.

12:07.848 --> 12:09.970
So I'm walking down
the aisle like this...

12:11.559 --> 12:14.725
Looks clear. Okay, Teresa.

12:14.895 --> 12:17.895
Now this terrible thing can come off.

12:18.689 --> 12:20.646
So she's okay. Can we go?

12:20.816 --> 12:24.266
Her neck is fine, but I need to do
a complete neurological exam.

12:24.443 --> 12:27.443
Well, how long is that gonna take?
I gotta get back to work.

12:27.612 --> 12:29.734
It may take a few hours.

12:30.155 --> 12:32.361
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- Forget about it.

12:32.532 --> 12:34.275
I gotta call them. Is there a phone?

12:34.450 --> 12:37.119
Pay phone in the waiting area.

12:38.578 --> 12:41.412
I need to examine your face.

12:43.081 --> 12:45.406
- Any pain here?
- No.

12:45.583 --> 12:48.453
- Here?
- It doesn't hurt anymore.

12:48.627 --> 12:51.247
You worried about your father?

12:53.130 --> 12:56.165
I'm sure he wants us to be certain
that you're all right.

12:56.341 --> 12:58.498
Will you stand up, please?

13:02.261 --> 13:06.388
Okay, now lift your arms up,
keeping your eyes shut.

13:07.932 --> 13:11.181
- Higher?
- No, that's fine.

13:16.688 --> 13:19.392
Keep your eyes closed
for a little longer.

13:20.775 --> 13:24.641
All right, final call. Is everybody
finished with these bagels here?

13:24.819 --> 13:27.440
Wait. There's still some
fresh-squeezed orange juice.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.770
- Fresh-squeezed?
- Yes, fresh-squeezed.

13:29.948 --> 13:31.987
Think I'd use concentrate?
There you go.

13:32.158 --> 13:33.402
- Try that.
- Thank you.

13:33.575 --> 13:34.773
Frank?

13:34.951 --> 13:37.109
Frank?

13:37.620 --> 13:39.861
How much longer do you
think my daughter will be?

13:40.038 --> 13:42.991
I don't know.
I think she's still with a patient.

13:43.165 --> 13:45.288
- All right.
- She'll be out as soon as she can.

13:45.459 --> 13:46.621
I'll be over here.

13:46.793 --> 13:48.417
- May I?
- Yes. Eat up.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.412
Thank you.

13:50.587 --> 13:51.785
Who's that?

13:51.963 --> 13:55.876
Some nut job who claims she's
Abby's mom. Weaver called Psych.

13:56.049 --> 13:58.622
- No kidding?
- Nice legs, huh?

13:58.801 --> 14:00.628
Mother-daughter fantasies
come to mind.

14:00.803 --> 14:05.131
Dr. Malucci, I think we have
patients needing your attention.

14:05.306 --> 14:06.385
Actually, we don't.

14:06.557 --> 14:08.881
Rescue 54 is two minutes out.
GSW to the chest.

14:09.059 --> 14:11.727
- There. Now you're busy.
- Gunshot wound. Yes!

14:11.894 --> 14:13.008
- Not alone.
- I can do it.

14:13.187 --> 14:15.179
- Where's Benton?
- Surgery. Corday's around-

14:15.355 --> 14:16.434
Okay, find her. Go.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.178
I'm ordering a CT on a girl
while I call the police.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.729
- Head trauma?
- No. I'm just stalling for time.

14:21.901 --> 14:24.901
I think her father's abusing her,
and he wants to take her home.

14:25.070 --> 14:27.560
Send her up. When the cops show,
cancel the procedure.

14:27.738 --> 14:29.529
- Okay.
- Still no Psych?

14:29.698 --> 14:31.073
I could page them again.

14:31.241 --> 14:35.403
- Abby has no idea who she is?
- Said she'd never seen her before.

14:40.206 --> 14:41.699
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:41.873 --> 14:43.332
I think the bagels were a hit.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.954
- Everybody loved them.
- I put everything in bags.

14:46.126 --> 14:48.035
- I put it in the refrigerator.
- Great.

14:48.211 --> 14:50.666
- Go in there whenever.
- Can you stop for one minute?

14:50.838 --> 14:54.040
There was a lot of leftovers in there.
I threw them away.

14:54.215 --> 14:57.548
- You can't leave that...
- Can I talk to you for just a minute?

14:57.718 --> 15:01.761
Oh, my God. Look how pretty you are.

15:01.929 --> 15:05.593
You have a beautiful face. You just
pick your hair back a little bit.

15:05.765 --> 15:09.429
- I need you to stay in our waiting area.
- Could I work on you?

15:09.601 --> 15:14.096
- That's what I do...
- I can't have you back here by yourself.

15:14.271 --> 15:17.520
I'm an artist. I do collages and things.
I do makeovers to make money.

15:17.690 --> 15:20.809
- I could make you over.
- I can't have you back here by yourself.

15:20.984 --> 15:23.854
- I'm waiting for Abby.
- Okay. It's just right across the hall.

15:24.028 --> 15:26.435
- You won't miss her.
- There are sick people there.

15:26.613 --> 15:30.610
Maggie, the thing is, Abby says
that you are not her mother.

15:31.117 --> 15:33.523
Of course I'm her mother.

15:33.702 --> 15:36.737
- Why don't we gather up your things-
- Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

15:36.912 --> 15:38.703
So she...

15:38.955 --> 15:41.624
She said she's not my daughter?

15:42.541 --> 15:45.032
- Please, let's go.
- No.

15:45.210 --> 15:46.953
Where is she? Abby!

15:47.128 --> 15:48.586
- Damn it! Damn it!
- Maggie?

15:48.962 --> 15:51.797
Abby! Abby, where are you?!

15:51.965 --> 15:54.122
- Maggie, take it easy.
- Abby, it's your mother!

15:54.300 --> 15:55.959
- Maggie, it's all right.
- Abby!

15:56.134 --> 15:58.422
- Maggie, you cannot go back there!
- Abby!

15:58.594 --> 16:01.464
Frank, call Security!
Get Psych down here now!

16:01.638 --> 16:02.800
Abby!

16:02.972 --> 16:05.297
God, please pick up.
Please pick up.

16:05.474 --> 16:08.474
This is Eric. Leave a message
after the beep.

16:09.394 --> 16:13.639
Eric, if you' re there, pick up
the phone. It's Abby. Eric?

16:13.813 --> 16:17.312
Hello? Hello?

16:17.483 --> 16:19.475
Okay. Eric, Mom is in Chicago.

16:19.651 --> 16:24.062
What the hell is she doing in Chicago?
Because I can't take her now.

16:24.237 --> 16:27.321
Okay? She can't be here. I-

16:28.657 --> 16:34.409
- Al, I'm afraid you've herniated a disk.
- That doesn't sound too good.

16:34.578 --> 16:36.451
With the weakness in your foot...

16:36.621 --> 16:39.989
...you'll need surgery to eliminate
the pressure on your nerve.

16:40.165 --> 16:45.040
- Can it wait till I get home?
- I wouldn't suggest it.

16:45.336 --> 16:48.371
I don't want back surgery.

16:49.422 --> 16:51.746
Then I'd recommend
an outpatient procedure.

16:51.924 --> 16:54.081
Endoscopic surgery.

16:54.259 --> 16:56.713
- How long will that take?
- An hour.

16:56.885 --> 16:59.672
I'd insert a small endoscope
into your spinal column...

16:59.846 --> 17:05.680
...and remove fragments of the disk.
Couple of stitches and a Band-Aid.

17:05.849 --> 17:09.183
Dr. Corday, got a GSW to the chest.
Benton's still upstairs.

17:09.519 --> 17:12.852
- Okay.
- Will I be able to surf again?

17:13.521 --> 17:18.515
I don't see why not.
If you'll excuse me...

17:20.861 --> 17:23.351
Call the O.R. Book a room
for an endoscopic discectomy.

17:23.529 --> 17:27.526
Abby! Abby!
Abby Lockhart! Abby!

17:27.699 --> 17:30.865
Maggie! Maggie, calm down.

17:31.034 --> 17:33.785
- What the hell is all that about?
- Abby! Abby! Abby!

17:33.953 --> 17:35.862
- You need to calm down.
- Abby!

17:36.038 --> 17:37.200
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Abby!

17:37.372 --> 17:41.285
- Somebody. No, there's...
- Hey, I think someone's calling you.

17:41.459 --> 17:43.415
- Is there someone we can call-?
- Abby!

17:43.585 --> 17:46.953
Maggie! Maggie!
You need to calm down.

17:47.129 --> 17:49.002
- Have a seat, ma'am.
- Calm down.

17:49.172 --> 17:50.547
- Have a seat.
- All right.

17:50.715 --> 17:54.462
- Take a breath.
- Okay. All right. All right. I'm fine.

17:54.634 --> 17:57.718
Abby! Abby.

17:57.887 --> 18:01.136
There she is. That's my daughter.

18:02.432 --> 18:04.720
Hi, Mom.

18:07.227 --> 18:11.223
- Abdomen's soft. No rebound.
- Please! I don't wanna die!

18:11.396 --> 18:14.065
Hey, partner, pipe down.
I can barely hear anything.

18:14.232 --> 18:16.722
Decreased breath sounds on the left.
Trachea midline.

18:16.900 --> 18:19.272
Trauma panel, O-neg, cross times 10.

18:19.444 --> 18:23.357
- He needs a chest tube.
- Mother, may I? Huh? Chest tube?

18:23.530 --> 18:25.072
Step in.

18:25.239 --> 18:29.402
Look at you. Look at you.
You're still so pretty.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.484
- Why are you here?
- I came to see you.

18:31.661 --> 18:33.902
- How'd you get here?
- I came on the bus.

18:34.079 --> 18:38.740
- Does Eric know where you are?
- You know how busy your brother is.

18:38.916 --> 18:41.750
So you just left?
And you didn't call.

18:41.918 --> 18:44.373
Why didn't you call me
and tell me you were coming?

18:44.545 --> 18:48.078
I was worried about you. I heard
about you and Richard separating.

18:48.256 --> 18:50.129
A year ago.

18:51.675 --> 18:54.212
Yeah. I'm divorced.

18:56.595 --> 18:59.263
- Oh, my God.
- What about your job?

18:59.430 --> 19:01.837
The department store.

19:02.182 --> 19:06.131
My daughter is more important
than any stupid job.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.931
You know what? I left all my stuff
in the coffee room.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.772
I'm gonna go get it.
And you and I are gonna talk.

19:11.939 --> 19:13.516
I'm working.

19:13.690 --> 19:16.394
I know. I know. I know. I know.

19:16.567 --> 19:21.940
But I'm gonna wait for you.
And we're gonna talk. I'll be back.

19:28.951 --> 19:32.485
Frank said that you said
you didn't know her.

19:41.043 --> 19:44.043
How long has she been bipolar?

19:44.212 --> 19:46.619
Since I was a kid.

19:48.340 --> 19:52.171
- And she's off her meds?
- Apparently.

19:52.343 --> 19:54.584
I called the inn.
They said the weather's great.

19:54.761 --> 19:58.592
- Getting away for the weekend?
- Pending any last-minute complications.

19:58.764 --> 20:01.219
He means me. And there won't be.

20:01.391 --> 20:04.889
- Hemoglobin's 11.
- How much you get out?

20:06.061 --> 20:07.602
Only 700 cc's.

20:07.770 --> 20:11.019
- He's losing blood somewhere.
- Pressure's dropping, 60 palp.

20:11.189 --> 20:15.649
- No breath sounds on the right.
- Bullet must have tumbled to the right.

20:15.817 --> 20:18.604
- Intubate and put in a second chest tube.
- Right you are.

20:18.778 --> 20:21.482
- Okay, we need a chest tube tray.
- Tension hemopneumo?

20:21.655 --> 20:23.861
Yeah. Let's find out.

20:24.574 --> 20:27.693
- So where you guys going?
- Wisconsin. Lake Hatteras.

20:27.868 --> 20:30.572
- Heard you had a kid.
- GSW. It's surgical.

20:30.745 --> 20:34.693
- So you've got it?
- Three docs, no waiting.

20:36.749 --> 20:40.283
- He's bleeding into his right chest.
- Lost his pressure.

20:40.460 --> 20:45.167
I love this guy. He's an entire medical
education in one convenient package.

20:48.382 --> 20:49.792
Jackie?

20:49.967 --> 20:53.251
Oh, God. Cleo, do you know
where Peter is?

20:53.427 --> 20:55.419
He's up in the O.R.
Why are you down here?

20:55.596 --> 20:58.002
I'm trying to reach him.
I told the man at the desk.

20:58.181 --> 20:59.722
What happened? What's the matter?

20:59.890 --> 21:03.424
Well, they called me at work
and I came right away. It's Jesse.

21:03.601 --> 21:06.352
- They said that he was brought here.
- Jesse? Your son?

21:06.520 --> 21:09.805
The man over there said that he was
brought in a few minutes ago.

21:09.981 --> 21:12.186
That he was shot.

21:12.858 --> 21:15.609
Somebody shot my boy.

21:22.691 --> 21:25.062
Where's Dr. Benton?

21:25.234 --> 21:27.985
Two, with Spencer on a hernia.

21:31.615 --> 21:35.991
AUTHORIZED
PERSONNEL ONLY

21:49.295 --> 21:52.330
- What the hell are you doing?
- Found a hole in the right ventricle.

21:52.506 --> 21:55.210
Let's cross-clamp the aorta.

21:55.508 --> 21:57.915
Thank God for bangers, huh?
Better than a good war.

21:58.093 --> 22:01.675
- Come on. Get out of my way.
- Hey! Hey, that's my patient.

22:01.846 --> 22:03.339
Peter, we've got it.

22:03.513 --> 22:05.470
I'll oversew it. 2-0 silk. Move!

22:05.640 --> 22:08.641
- Dr. Malucci's assisting.
- The guy's not even gonna make it.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.644
- It's his nephew.
- What?

22:11.812 --> 22:15.227
- It's Jackie's son, Jesse.
- Oh, my God.

22:17.774 --> 22:20.347
Where the hell's the 2-0 silk?!

22:21.235 --> 22:23.904
- Hey, Frank.
- Half day?

22:24.072 --> 22:26.064
Twelve to twelve. Much going on?

22:26.240 --> 22:27.734
Pretty slow.

22:27.908 --> 22:29.900
My mother's here.

22:30.076 --> 22:34.950
- You weren't expecting her?
- No. Do you have a few minutes?

22:35.121 --> 22:36.152
Sure.

22:36.330 --> 22:39.330
Pregnancy test on that Ruiz girl.

22:39.499 --> 22:43.117
Damn it.
Where the hell are the police?

22:44.337 --> 22:46.708
I'm a few minutes early.
You want to grab coffee?

22:46.880 --> 22:48.754
- Yeah. That'd be great.
- Okay.

22:48.923 --> 22:50.999
- Still not filling.
- There's another hole.

22:51.175 --> 22:54.590
Left ventricle is macerated on the
posterior surface. More 2-0 silk!

22:54.761 --> 22:57.631
Blood's pouring out of the right chest!
Open his other side.

22:57.805 --> 22:59.050
- Hold on.
- Peter.

22:59.223 --> 23:01.927
I can get it! Somebody cut off
that damn alarm.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.673
- There's no time, Peter.
- Another thoracotomy tray?

23:04.852 --> 23:07.805
Lizzie, you ordered a percutaneous
discectomy on a 50-year-old?

23:07.980 --> 23:09.010
Robert, I'm busy.

23:09.189 --> 23:11.761
It looks like Doctors
Greene and Benton have this.

23:11.941 --> 23:14.645
Why don't you step out, please?

23:21.699 --> 23:24.652
That's Peter's nephew in there.

23:24.826 --> 23:28.905
And you've opened up both sides of
his chest, huh? Well, anyway...

23:29.079 --> 23:31.699
Patterson is a candidate
for open lumbar disk surgery.

23:31.872 --> 23:35.206
- Endoscopic surgery's the best treatment.
- And it's faster too.

23:35.376 --> 23:38.376
Yes, it is. No dramatic muscle
dissection, no bone removal.

23:38.545 --> 23:42.837
And you can still ditch out of here
in time for your romantic weekend.

23:43.006 --> 23:44.833
What the hell are you insinuating?

23:45.008 --> 23:48.589
That I'd choose an inappropriate course
of surgery to accommodate my plans?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.418
You said it, not me.

23:51.597 --> 23:53.055
I've got to get back.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.882
Gloves!

23:55.057 --> 23:57.299
- The bullet tore up the hilum.
- Foley catheter.

23:57.476 --> 24:00.429
- I'll throw in a purse string.
- No. I'll do it.

24:00.603 --> 24:02.761
- What was going on out there?
- Nothing.

24:02.938 --> 24:05.179
Heart's not filling.

24:05.356 --> 24:09.484
All right. We're gonna bypass. I'll take
the aorta. You take the femoral vein.

24:09.652 --> 24:10.731
We need ice!

24:11.237 --> 24:13.857
- Malucci, get four basins full.
- What for?

24:14.030 --> 24:16.022
We'll pack the head
to preserve his brain.

24:16.198 --> 24:19.115
- That'll work?
- Just get it!

24:25.080 --> 24:26.824
She sold cosmetics.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.406
But she used to get fired all the time.

24:29.584 --> 24:31.243
What about your dad?

24:31.418 --> 24:36.209
He split when I was 7.
Couldn't take it.

24:36.964 --> 24:39.419
She's an artist.

24:39.966 --> 24:43.215
And when I was little and she
was manic, it was fun, actually.

24:43.385 --> 24:47.632
Because we would do stuff like
camp out in the living room.

24:47.806 --> 24:50.759
Actually really camp out
with tents and stuff.

24:50.933 --> 24:53.305
We painted the walls
of the living room once.

24:53.477 --> 24:56.346
This whole landscape. It was...

24:57.313 --> 25:00.763
Then suddenly everything would change.
She'd start screaming and crying.

25:00.940 --> 25:03.977
Eric took the brunt of that.
He was more of a rebel than I was.

25:04.527 --> 25:06.934
- Eric is your brother.
- Yeah.

25:07.112 --> 25:09.318
She was living near him in Florida.

25:09.489 --> 25:12.524
He's in the Air Force.
He's an air traffic controller.

25:13.033 --> 25:15.405
- Really?
- Yes.

25:19.079 --> 25:22.780
And then she would get depressed
and just go to bed for weeks.

25:22.958 --> 25:26.077
So by the age of 10 I had
figured out how to scam meals...

25:26.252 --> 25:29.999
...off the neighbors
so Eric and I could eat.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.463
Could get her some help. You could
get her on lithium or Depakote.

25:34.633 --> 25:38.962
No. She won't take the drugs.
She likes it when she's manic.

25:42.473 --> 25:45.805
But I can't do this again.

25:50.270 --> 25:52.974
I'm not strong enough.

25:59.986 --> 26:03.603
Jackie? Jackie.

26:03.780 --> 26:04.978
Did you find Peter?

26:05.156 --> 26:07.611
He's in with the trauma team
working on Jesse now.

26:07.992 --> 26:11.324
Oh, thank God. How is he?

26:11.494 --> 26:14.068
He was shot in the chest.

26:14.247 --> 26:18.493
We found some bleeding around his heart
and Peter's trying to repair it now.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.659
His heart?

26:20.835 --> 26:23.123
His condition is very grave.

26:23.295 --> 26:27.457
They're working to stabilize him
so they can move him to the O.R.

26:28.674 --> 26:32.458
Oh, Lord. I...

26:32.636 --> 26:35.209
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

26:35.388 --> 26:38.838
No. I should try Walt again.
He's out on a parts run...

26:39.015 --> 26:42.597
- ... and I don't know what's keeping him.
- Mrs. Robbins?

26:43.310 --> 26:45.635
Is Jesse okay?

26:45.812 --> 26:47.888
Get out.

26:48.148 --> 26:50.187
Is he all right?

26:51.609 --> 26:54.277
- You don't get to be here.
- Please...

26:54.444 --> 26:58.772
Get out. Get out!
I don't want you here!

26:58.947 --> 27:03.407
You get away from him.
You stay away from my son!

27:13.709 --> 27:16.281
All right. The aortic clamp is released.

27:16.461 --> 27:20.539
- Stop the bypass.
- Sponge stick. Still has oozing.

27:23.216 --> 27:24.710
I can't see.

27:24.884 --> 27:27.553
- I'll suction.
- All right.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.925
Move the light!

27:31.389 --> 27:33.381
He's bleeding out everywhere.

27:33.557 --> 27:35.964
All right. Let's get a...

27:36.142 --> 27:41.302
Give him a... Give him...
Give him two units of FFP...

27:41.480 --> 27:45.347
...and a 10-pack of platelets.

27:45.525 --> 27:48.893
- He's not clotting.
- We can reverse it. More suction.

27:49.069 --> 27:51.144
Pump's running dry.

27:51.321 --> 27:55.566
- We're not keeping up with blood loss.
- Well, squeeze it in faster!

28:01.454 --> 28:05.035
Finally. Where you been?
I've waited here for hours.

28:05.206 --> 28:08.491
You said you were gonna run
a few tests and then you disappear.

28:08.667 --> 28:11.371
My eye is just a little sore.
Otherwise, I feel okay.

28:11.544 --> 28:15.791
I'm gonna lose my job and
we've been sitting here for hours.

28:15.965 --> 28:18.087
Mr. Ruiz, would you
step out in the hall?

28:18.592 --> 28:23.252
- Who the hell is this?
- Please, sir. Out in the hall.

28:23.554 --> 28:26.304
Teresa, you wait here.

28:26.848 --> 28:30.512
I'm Detective Tancredi, Chicago P.D.

28:30.684 --> 28:33.436
Dr. Kovac here is concerned
about the extensive bruising...

28:33.603 --> 28:37.386
...he discovered on your daughter's
body when he examined her.

28:37.564 --> 28:38.595
What?

28:38.774 --> 28:41.394
She has bruises all over
her back and stomach.

28:41.567 --> 28:45.149
- From her fall.
- They're at least a week old.

28:45.779 --> 28:48.613
You think I beat my little girl?

28:49.741 --> 28:53.156
Oh, my God.

28:54.828 --> 28:59.702
I love my daughter.
I would never...

29:00.665 --> 29:02.953
No.

29:03.876 --> 29:08.253
You're wrong. You are very wrong.

29:11.674 --> 29:14.294
More lap pads. I can't see.

29:16.219 --> 29:21.128
If I can put one more suture in,
I can stop the ventricular bleeding.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.676
Cut.

29:28.979 --> 29:32.062
Chest cavity is filling with blood.

29:33.440 --> 29:36.109
He's oozing everywhere.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.766
Come on, Jesse. Come on, man.

29:38.944 --> 29:41.269
Don't give up on me.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.315
Jesse...

29:45.491 --> 29:47.483
Come on, man.

29:47.910 --> 29:50.910
Don't give up, please.

29:56.583 --> 29:58.076
Come on, Jesse.

29:58.250 --> 30:00.290
Peter...

30:06.090 --> 30:08.082
Peter.

30:43.202 --> 30:46.255
No!

31:01.982 --> 31:06.144
If I work Christmas Day, I get
Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve off.

31:06.318 --> 31:07.729
New Year's Day too.

31:07.903 --> 31:09.776
Yeah, right.

31:09.946 --> 31:11.902
Hi.

31:13.824 --> 31:15.566
Hey.

31:15.742 --> 31:17.401
D., can you guys give us a minute?

31:17.576 --> 31:19.983
- Yeah.
- You bet.

31:32.462 --> 31:34.703
So...?

31:34.880 --> 31:36.789
Yeah.

31:37.549 --> 31:43.217
I'm sorry. I guess I should
have told you sooner.

31:44.637 --> 31:47.839
Well, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to say.

31:49.849 --> 31:54.260
I want to give him up for adoption,
but I need your permission to do it.

31:54.436 --> 31:56.262
Him?

31:59.689 --> 32:02.393
Will you sign the paperwork?

32:02.566 --> 32:04.475
Please?

32:12.573 --> 32:14.197
Where's Peter?

32:14.366 --> 32:17.450
- Still talking to his sister.
- God, what a tragedy.

32:17.619 --> 32:21.698
- You didn't recognize him?
- I only met him once. You all right?

32:21.872 --> 32:23.116
Headache.

32:23.289 --> 32:25.862
Your neck's still sore from hockey.

32:26.041 --> 32:29.374
Next time I'm gonna go early
and warm up.

32:29.544 --> 32:30.919
My O.R.'s free.

32:31.378 --> 32:32.409
You still want to go?

32:32.588 --> 32:35.588
I have an outpatient procedure.
Should take less than an hour.

32:35.756 --> 32:37.832
It's Friday. If we leave before 6-

32:38.008 --> 32:41.127
One hour, I promise.

32:42.303 --> 32:44.544
- Dr. Greene?
- Yep?

32:44.721 --> 32:46.215
What should we do with the body?

32:46.389 --> 32:48.013
I don't know where Benton went.

32:48.182 --> 32:50.055
- Police been here?
- Not that I've seen.

32:50.225 --> 32:52.466
You can't do anything
until they sign off on it.

32:52.643 --> 32:56.391
- It's a real freak show, though.
- Why don't you pull a sheet over it?

32:56.563 --> 32:57.973
- You think he heard me?
- Who?

32:58.147 --> 33:02.891
Benton. You know, all that stuff I was
saying about his nephew before I knew.

33:03.359 --> 33:05.316
I don't know.

33:06.236 --> 33:08.312
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

33:08.488 --> 33:11.025
- Is Teresa Ruiz here?
- Who are you?

33:11.198 --> 33:13.356
A friend. They brought
her here from school.

33:13.533 --> 33:15.821
She never went back. I got worried.

33:15.993 --> 33:17.451
Radiology. You can't miss it.

33:17.619 --> 33:20.489
Just look for a long line
of pissed-off people.

33:20.663 --> 33:23.865
- Could you tell her Vinnie stopped by?
- Yeah, Vinnie. Right.

33:24.040 --> 33:28.251
So where's the best surfing spot
for a beginner like me?

33:29.419 --> 33:32.918
Waikiki. But you've got
to get out there early.

33:33.089 --> 33:36.955
Damn. It's bleeding. Cautery.

33:37.133 --> 33:38.924
- It's 10 to 6.
- I know.

33:39.093 --> 33:41.251
Pressure's dropping, 100/80.

33:41.428 --> 33:44.760
Okay. Let's run in another liter.

33:44.930 --> 33:47.634
I can see the disk.

33:49.725 --> 33:52.678
Can't get a good hold of it.

33:52.852 --> 33:55.722
There we go. Got it.

34:01.942 --> 34:06.519
- We got some leaking fluid.
- It's just irrigation solution.

34:06.696 --> 34:10.609
It's looking good.
Let's get ready with 4-0 Vicryl.

34:10.782 --> 34:12.406
We're almost there, Mr. Patterson.

34:12.574 --> 34:15.360
You'll be hanging 10 again
before you know it.

34:15.534 --> 34:19.447
Hanging 10. So you do know
something about surfing.

34:19.621 --> 34:23.452
Only what I've picked up watching
old Frankie Avalon movies.

34:29.378 --> 34:32.960
- What are you doing?
- Waiting for you.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.253
Can I see?

34:38.176 --> 34:40.962
- They're beautiful.
- Yeah.

34:42.971 --> 34:45.094
May I see?

34:47.141 --> 34:49.891
This is Dr. Legaspi.

34:50.310 --> 34:53.594
- Psychiatrist?
- Yes.

34:54.228 --> 34:56.268
I don't need you.

34:56.938 --> 34:59.264
Abby tells me
you have bipolar disorder.

34:59.441 --> 35:02.192
- How long have you been off your meds?
- Am I off my meds?

35:02.652 --> 35:04.478
Why'd you stop?

35:04.653 --> 35:07.060
I don't like lithium, all right?
It makes me tired.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.815
It makes me sick to my stomach.

35:08.990 --> 35:12.571
I can't do these on drugs.
I can't do anything.

35:12.826 --> 35:15.446
What medication are you on now?

35:15.619 --> 35:17.611
Prozac.

35:18.746 --> 35:22.114
I was depressed. A doctor at my HMO,
he gave them to me.

35:22.291 --> 35:25.077
Stay away from antidepressants.
They trigger manic episodes.

35:25.251 --> 35:26.282
She knows.

35:26.460 --> 35:29.164
I'll write you a
prescription for Depakote...

35:29.337 --> 35:31.460
...if you promise me you'll
stay away from Prozac.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.421
Sure.

35:33.590 --> 35:36.793
Great. I will go get you the scrip.

35:36.968 --> 35:40.418
- You okay?
- Thank you.

35:49.018 --> 35:52.516
- So are you gonna take it?
- You bet.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.732
What's this?

36:03.486 --> 36:07.234
I called. That's enough for
a bus ticket back to Tampa.

36:07.906 --> 36:10.692
Oh, don't. Really, don't.
Don't start.

36:10.867 --> 36:14.484
Mom, I can't have you here. I told you
that last time. I can't do it anymore.

36:14.661 --> 36:17.661
I came here to be with you
after what happened with Richard.

36:18.038 --> 36:20.493
I'm fine! Just please go home.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.079
Why do you want to hurt me?
Why do you want-?

36:23.250 --> 36:26.950
I didn't ask you to come here.
You just showed up.

36:27.128 --> 36:30.959
Off your meds, in a dress that would be
ridiculous on a woman half your age...

36:31.131 --> 36:34.166
...running around the hospital screaming,
humiliating me.

36:34.341 --> 36:35.504
Why, why, why...?

36:35.676 --> 36:38.248
Oh, now the crying
and the depression.

36:38.428 --> 36:39.590
You know what comes next?

36:39.762 --> 36:42.881
Weeks of worrying that I'll come home
and find you dead in my tub!

36:43.056 --> 36:44.882
Or with your head stuck in my oven.

36:45.057 --> 36:48.556
All right! All right!

36:48.727 --> 36:52.426
All right! Fine!

36:53.105 --> 36:55.595
I'm out.

37:08.449 --> 37:10.488
Dr. Benton?

37:15.871 --> 37:18.954
Listen, I'm sorry.

37:19.623 --> 37:21.283
I didn't know he was your nephew.

37:21.458 --> 37:23.664
Get away from me.

37:24.502 --> 37:27.751
Look, I just thought
he was some banger.

37:29.088 --> 37:30.333
Six o'clock, on the dot.

37:30.506 --> 37:33.459
- You're ready to go?
- I'm waiting for you.

37:33.633 --> 37:34.878
What is that?

37:35.051 --> 37:39.297
Hey, stop it! Stop it!
Peter! Hey!

37:39.471 --> 37:42.043
Kerry, you okay?
You all right?

37:42.223 --> 37:43.764
Peter!

37:43.974 --> 37:46.678
- Hey! Hey, easy!
- What the hell's going on?!

37:46.893 --> 37:49.727
- Malucci!
- Stop.

37:53.898 --> 37:56.814
I was just trying to apologize.

38:20.166 --> 38:23.451
She says her father never touched her.
Says she falls down a lot.

38:23.627 --> 38:26.746
- And you believe her?
- Doesn't matter what I believe.

38:26.921 --> 38:29.458
Court's not gonna remove her
when he denies it...

38:29.631 --> 38:30.959
...and she says it's not him.

38:31.132 --> 38:34.999
- Can I talk to her?
- Sure.

38:48.061 --> 38:50.432
What happened this morning?

38:52.606 --> 38:54.977
I fell down.

38:55.775 --> 38:58.561
What about the other bruises?

39:00.528 --> 39:03.528
My father wouldn't hurt me.

39:04.197 --> 39:09.237
Sometimes people who love us
hurt us anyway.

39:09.409 --> 39:12.362
Sometimes they can't
control their anger.

39:12.536 --> 39:18.158
No, they don't mean to,
but they do hurt us. It's a sickness.

39:18.332 --> 39:21.831
And something they need help with.

39:25.379 --> 39:28.083
Do you know you're pregnant?

39:30.257 --> 39:32.830
We ran a test.

39:37.888 --> 39:40.923
I told him this would happen.

39:41.307 --> 39:44.924
- He wouldn't listen to me.
- Listen to you about what?

39:45.101 --> 39:47.971
He won't wear a condom. He won't.

39:48.437 --> 39:51.639
That's what we fight about
all the time.

39:52.565 --> 39:55.684
That's when he hits me.
But he doesn't mean to.

39:55.859 --> 39:57.898
Your father?

39:58.069 --> 40:02.480
- No! Not my dad.
- Then who?

40:02.655 --> 40:04.647
- Vinnie.
- Vinnie?

40:04.823 --> 40:08.737
My boyfriend.
We're in homeroom together.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.409
He's in the seventh grade?

40:13.580 --> 40:17.706
He'd never hurt me on purpose.
He just gets upset.

40:17.874 --> 40:20.162
He loves me.

40:22.794 --> 40:26.209
- What is it? I was halfway to my car.
- Patient's complaining of backache.

40:26.380 --> 40:28.503
- What patient?
- Patterson, lumbar discectomy.

40:28.674 --> 40:29.788
- Dr. Corday's case.
- Yes.

40:29.966 --> 40:31.626
She signed him out to me. Great.

40:31.801 --> 40:34.754
Mr. Patterson, I understand
you're having a bit of a headache.

40:34.928 --> 40:37.169
You want a couple of Tylenol?

40:37.346 --> 40:38.923
My back, it's killing me.

40:39.098 --> 40:41.504
Okay. Roll over on your side.

40:43.809 --> 40:45.766
I can't move my legs.

40:45.936 --> 40:47.928
- Can you feel this?
- No.

40:48.104 --> 40:50.143
You, help me roll him.

40:53.524 --> 40:55.563
Mr. Patterson, you're leaking spinal fluid.

40:55.734 --> 40:58.106
It's probably a cord compression.
Get him to O.R.

40:58.445 --> 40:59.855
And find me Elizabeth Corday.

41:03.365 --> 41:07.693
- Mark, it's lovely.
- Nice big bed.

41:07.993 --> 41:10.364
Let's see the bathroom.

41:10.703 --> 41:13.538
Hey, the tub. It's huge!

41:13.705 --> 41:15.116
We can both fit in it!

41:15.290 --> 41:19.203
Hello? Yeah. Elizabeth.

41:19.376 --> 41:22.127
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

41:22.712 --> 41:25.546
Hello. This is Elizabeth Corday.

41:27.548 --> 41:29.754
Elizabeth...?

43:07.285 --> 43:12.409
Where's your coat? You look
like you're freezing to death.

43:13.540 --> 43:17.868
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

43:18.752 --> 43:22.416
I've ruined everything.
I know. I've ruined everything.

43:22.588 --> 43:25.956
And I've hurt you
and your brother so much.

43:26.132 --> 43:30.508
I'm sorry. You have every right
to hate me. Of course you hate me.

43:30.677 --> 43:32.052
- I don't hate you.
- I'm sorry.

43:32.220 --> 43:33.963
- I don't hate you, Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

43:34.138 --> 43:36.806
- It's okay.
- I love you. I love you so much.

43:36.973 --> 43:39.807
You're my angel. My angel.

43:39.975 --> 43:43.141
I never meant to hurt you.
I never meant to hurt you.

43:43.311 --> 43:45.433
Please forgive me.
Oh, please forgive me.

43:45.604 --> 43:48.095
I forgive you, Mom.

43:53.360 --> 43:56.313
When you were born,
you were this little baby.

43:56.487 --> 43:58.645
It was like you were
the answer to my prayers.

43:58.822 --> 44:01.146
You were the answer
to all my prayers.

44:01.324 --> 44:03.363
And I thought to myself,
I'll be okay now.

44:03.534 --> 44:07.779
I'll be okay because you're here.
I'll be okay.

44:07.953 --> 44:10.657
And I held your little hands.

44:10.830 --> 44:12.573
I loved you. God, how I loved you.

44:12.748 --> 44:14.408
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

44:14.583 --> 44:18.117
- I know.
- I'm so sorry.
