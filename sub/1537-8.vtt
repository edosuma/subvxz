08:44.619 --> 08:45.752
Yes!

08:45.753 --> 08:48.822
You have served your country
proud, little lady.

08:51.659 --> 08:53.627
Stop!

08:53.661 --> 08:54.828
Whoa!

08:54.829 --> 08:56.363
Ow, ow, ow, help me up!

08:56.364 --> 08:58.332
Peralta, help!
Help me up.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.499
Don't ditch me!

08:59.500 --> 09:03.003
[Groans] He's gone.

09:03.004 --> 09:04.004
You okay?

09:04.005 --> 09:06.540
No, I'm rattled.

09:08.943 --> 09:09.977
- Hey.
- Hmm?

09:09.978 --> 09:11.178
Where you going, Amy?

09:11.179 --> 09:13.347
Oh, I was just going outside to...

09:13.348 --> 09:16.183
See this pigeon I've been training.

09:16.184 --> 09:17.284
It does the can-can.

09:17.285 --> 09:20.520
That I gotta see!

09:20.521 --> 09:22.689
Damn it.
I made my lie too enticing.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.358
Fine, I was going out to smoke.

09:24.359 --> 09:27.861
Your lame system-reboot thing
didn't work.

09:27.862 --> 09:29.262
You know, I don't like
to talk about this,

09:29.263 --> 09:32.199
but many years ago,
I myself overcame an addiction.

09:32.200 --> 09:35.669
I could not get enough of the ponies.

09:35.670 --> 09:38.138
Go, Razzmataz.

09:38.139 --> 09:42.209
Go, Razzmataz.
Go, Razzmataz.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.745
(Sports announcer) It's Bugle Boy,
winning by a head.

09:44.746 --> 09:46.013
I lost everything.

09:46.014 --> 09:48.949
What worked for me
was replacing my bad addiction

09:48.950 --> 09:50.884
with a good addiction...

09:50.885 --> 09:52.686
Exercise.

09:52.687 --> 09:54.321
Grab your sneakers, Santiago.

09:54.322 --> 09:56.356
You're going me on a lunchtime jog.

09:56.357 --> 09:58.492
Great!
We can talk a little,

09:58.493 --> 10:01.295
chat about the job,
do some mentor-mentee bonding.

10:01.296 --> 10:03.497
We will exercise in silence.

10:03.498 --> 10:04.898
No headphones either.

10:04.899 --> 10:07.601
Music is a crutch.

10:07.602 --> 10:08.869
[Siren wails in distance]

10:08.870 --> 10:10.070
I'm sorry, let me get this straight.

10:10.071 --> 10:13.440
You had a giggle pig supplier
20 yards from you,

10:13.441 --> 10:14.908
and he got away?

10:14.909 --> 10:16.009
<i>What happened?</i>

10:16.010 --> 10:17.678
Your man here failed to follow

10:17.679 --> 10:20.714
proper law-enforcement procedure
is what happened.

10:20.715 --> 10:21.748
What?

10:21.749 --> 10:24.251
Always check
for ground-level obstructions

10:24.252 --> 10:26.053
before initiating a foot pursuit.

10:26.054 --> 10:27.621
(Jake)
The ground-level obstruction

10:27.622 --> 10:29.323
was your hand clutching my leg.

10:29.324 --> 10:31.224
I have claw marks all over my calf.

10:31.225 --> 10:34.027
I'm sorry, Rosa, can I talk
to you in private for a second?

10:34.028 --> 10:35.362
- Yeah.
- We'll be right back.

10:35.363 --> 10:37.631
Boyle, why don't you show Donger
what a fax machine is?

10:37.632 --> 10:39.499
Okay.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.804
Okay, imagine a letter had
unprotected sex with a phone.

10:43.805 --> 10:45.806
Look, it's not just
that Donger's annoying.

10:45.807 --> 10:47.607
He ruined the whole operation.

10:47.608 --> 10:50.077
The perp got away because
he's the world's biggest tool.

10:50.078 --> 10:52.512
No, tools can be useful.
He's the world's smallest tool.

10:52.513 --> 10:53.814
I'm the world's biggest tool.

10:53.815 --> 10:54.919
God! Do you see
what he's doing to me?

10:54.949 --> 10:57.117
Look, these dealers
didn't just randomly start

10:57.118 --> 10:58.118
using mailbox keys.

10:58.119 --> 10:59.653
There's clearly a postal connection.

10:59.654 --> 11:01.722
Sorry, dude,
you gotta keep working with him.

11:01.723 --> 11:02.990
Okay, wait, wait.

11:02.991 --> 11:04.324
Let's just put this
in perspective for a second.

11:04.325 --> 11:06.393
Is this whole war on drugs really worth

11:06.394 --> 11:08.028
the human cost of me
spending another minute

11:08.029 --> 11:09.162
with this behonkus?

11:09.163 --> 11:10.964
I don't know what
"behonkus" means, but yes.

11:10.965 --> 11:12.132
"Behonkus" means butt,

11:12.133 --> 11:14.034
and I think you could have
guessed that from context.

11:14.068 --> 11:17.971
Seriously, Jake, I'm asking you
to see this through.

11:17.972 --> 11:19.473
All right, fine.

11:19.474 --> 11:22.309
I will do it for you as a favor
because you're my friend.

11:22.310 --> 11:23.744
But if he tells me one more time

11:23.745 --> 11:26.446
about how USPIS "mailed down"
the Berlin wall,

11:26.447 --> 11:27.881
I'm gonna give him your home address,

11:27.882 --> 11:29.883
and you will receive
holiday cards from him forever.

11:29.884 --> 11:31.818
My own relatives
don't have that address.

11:31.819 --> 11:35.422
Oh, I know.
I know.

11:37.025 --> 11:38.025
[Watch beeps]

11:38.026 --> 11:41.161
And completion.

11:41.162 --> 11:43.497
[Sighs]

11:43.498 --> 11:44.531
So how do you feel?

11:44.532 --> 11:47.334
Really good.
No nicotine cravings at all.

11:47.335 --> 11:49.569
The magic of endorphins.

11:49.570 --> 11:51.705
I'm in a state of total euphoria.

11:51.706 --> 11:52.873
Clearly.

11:52.874 --> 11:54.174
Listen, I gotta jump in there, so...

11:54.175 --> 11:56.410
[Phone rings]

11:58.212 --> 11:59.212
Hello, Kevin.

11:59.213 --> 12:01.882
No, I haven't seen it.

12:01.883 --> 12:02.883
I very much doubt that.

12:02.884 --> 12:06.286
Why would the housekeeper
steal your belt?

12:06.287 --> 12:08.522
What husband?
She's a widow.

12:08.523 --> 12:13.393
I... uh-oh, I have to go.

12:13.394 --> 12:14.861
Santiago, are you smoking in there?

12:14.862 --> 12:16.163
<i>No.</i>

12:16.164 --> 12:17.431
Why do I see smoke?

12:17.432 --> 12:20.400
<i>That's steam.
I'm in the shower.</i>

12:20.401 --> 12:22.636
So what are a bunch of drug dealers

12:22.637 --> 12:24.571
doing with old postal keys?

12:24.572 --> 12:26.340
Maybe you guys forgot
to collect them all.

12:26.341 --> 12:28.275
Mm, barking up the wrong tree, McGruff.

12:28.276 --> 12:30.010
Postal service doesn't make mistakes.

12:30.011 --> 12:32.346
- You lose millions of letters every year.
- Really?

12:32.347 --> 12:35.048
Then explain to me why none
of these missing letters

12:35.049 --> 12:37.250
have ever been found.

12:37.251 --> 12:41.054
Okay, if it wasn't a mistake,
maybe it was an inside job.

12:41.055 --> 12:43.023
Who collected the keys?

12:46.060 --> 12:47.194
There are five people responsible

12:47.195 --> 12:48.328
for key collection in the city.

12:48.329 --> 12:50.530
Boom!
That's our list of suspects.

12:50.531 --> 12:53.767
We shall call them
"The Fellowship of the Key."

12:53.768 --> 12:55.202
I honestly think you are
the greatest man who ever lived.

12:55.203 --> 12:56.370
Oh.

12:56.371 --> 12:58.572
That's a no-go.

12:58.573 --> 12:59.840
Tracking these people down
is a waste of time.

12:59.841 --> 13:01.908
I say we keep surveilling
the mailboxes.

13:01.909 --> 13:05.145
Look, I have worked a ton
of these drug cases, all right?

13:05.146 --> 13:07.414
Once they know we're onto them,
they burn the whole system.

13:07.415 --> 13:09.616
Trust me, they're done with the boxes.

13:09.617 --> 13:12.953
Trust me.
I'm a federal agent.

13:12.954 --> 13:14.788
You're not FBI.
You're not ATF.

13:14.789 --> 13:16.290
<i>You work for the post office.</i>

13:16.291 --> 13:19.192
Your motto is
"surprisingly, we exist."

13:19.193 --> 13:20.394
Incorrect.

13:20.395 --> 13:23.530
Our motto is
<i>"nos custodimus quod lingus."</i>

13:23.531 --> 13:25.198
"We guard what you lick."

13:25.199 --> 13:26.300
That's worse!

13:26.301 --> 13:27.434
No, forget it.

13:27.435 --> 13:29.436
I'm not giving you the list of names.

13:29.437 --> 13:31.405
We're gonna keep surveilling
those mailboxes,

13:31.406 --> 13:33.307
and if nothing turns up
after a couple of days,

13:33.308 --> 13:35.609
then we'll go on your wild goose chase.

13:35.610 --> 13:38.211
Hey, if you're hungry,
Maury went postal

13:38.212 --> 13:39.646
and brought in muffins for everyone.

13:39.647 --> 13:41.081
Sweet.

13:41.082 --> 13:42.516
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go

13:42.517 --> 13:45.218
grab a muff with some bluebs,
and when I get back,

13:45.219 --> 13:47.421
we will discuss strategy
for the stakeouts.

13:50.959 --> 13:52.926
All right, guard the door.

13:52.927 --> 13:55.195
I'm gonna print out
this list of suspects,

13:55.196 --> 13:56.830
and then we are ditching Donger.

13:56.831 --> 13:58.098
It's kind of risky, Jake.

13:58.099 --> 14:00.133
If this ends up being
a dead end, Rosa's gonna be mad.

14:00.168 --> 14:02.603
You know, robo-partner would
not question this for a moment.

14:02.604 --> 14:06.006
Fine, I'll be lookout.

14:06.007 --> 14:07.741
- <i>Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!</i>
- What? Is he coming?

14:07.742 --> 14:09.343
No, but there's more than muffins.

14:09.344 --> 14:10.577
[Sniffs]
There's banana bread too!

14:10.578 --> 14:11.812
What?

14:11.813 --> 14:13.614
This printer is so slow!

14:13.615 --> 14:15.182
Come on.

14:15.183 --> 14:16.984
Ugh, this place is the worst!

14:19.551 --> 14:20.551
All right, two down, three to go.

14:20.552 --> 14:21.752
Next on the list, Kent Delroy.

14:21.887 --> 14:23.821
Worked at the post office for 12 years.

14:23.822 --> 14:26.457
Quit two years ago.

14:28.326 --> 14:30.294
That's the guy from this morning.

14:30.295 --> 14:31.929
NYPD, open up!

14:31.930 --> 14:32.897
All right, I'm gonna
break down the door.

14:32.931 --> 14:34.265
No, let me do it.

14:34.266 --> 14:36.000
Charles, that's never gone well.

14:36.001 --> 14:37.334
Yes, but I've been practicing.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.502
All right, fine.
You get one try.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.238
Thank you.

14:41.239 --> 14:42.807
Police!
Hands in the air!

14:42.808 --> 14:45.075
I did it!
Yes!

14:45.076 --> 14:46.577
Boyle, that's the bad guy.

14:46.578 --> 14:48.512
Yup, yup.
Turn around.

14:50.048 --> 14:51.248
This way, Santiago.

14:51.249 --> 14:52.349
<i>(Amy) What's going on?</i>

14:52.350 --> 14:53.918
Is this a dream?

14:53.919 --> 14:55.486
No, I'm not holding a label maker.

14:55.487 --> 14:58.322
Silence before the shaman.

14:58.323 --> 15:01.692
Amy, I'm taking charge of your
journey away from addiction.

15:01.726 --> 15:04.361
Gina is leading you
on a guided mediation.

15:04.362 --> 15:08.165
Terry and I agreed to participate
as a show of support.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.968
<i>Okay.</i>

15:10.969 --> 15:12.403
And, Amy, you don't know this

15:12.404 --> 15:15.039
'cause I don't necessarily
enjoy talking to you,

15:15.040 --> 15:19.176
but in my early 20s,
I too battled an addiction.

15:19.177 --> 15:21.245
I was a compulsive shopper.

15:21.246 --> 15:24.248
Anyway, meditation helped
me past that addiction.

15:24.249 --> 15:26.250
And it's gonna do the same for you.

15:26.251 --> 15:28.819
Close your eyes and repeat:

15:28.820 --> 15:31.288
I am in a vast hallway.

15:31.323 --> 15:33.991
(All) I am in a vast hallway.

15:34.025 --> 15:38.062
I walk into the light
of self-actualization.

15:38.063 --> 15:42.166
(All) I walk into the light
of self-actualization.

15:42.167 --> 15:45.002
For I am a powerful woman.

15:45.003 --> 15:47.972
For I am a powerful woman.

15:47.973 --> 15:50.508
I'm not hearing everyone.

15:50.509 --> 15:53.444
(Terry and Holt)
For I am a powerful woman.

15:53.445 --> 15:57.515
You feel the cool breeze
of enlightenment

15:57.516 --> 16:00.785
gently caressing your face.

16:00.786 --> 16:02.019
I feel it!

16:02.020 --> 16:03.087
I feel the breeze.

16:03.088 --> 16:04.255
Amy!

16:04.289 --> 16:06.423
What? I'm not
the one with my eyes open.

16:06.424 --> 16:07.424
Cheater!

16:07.425 --> 16:08.349
Captain Holt is cheating.

16:08.360 --> 16:10.227
Santiago, we're trying to help you.

16:10.228 --> 16:11.662
I can't do it.

16:11.663 --> 16:12.853
I quit quitting.

16:13.799 --> 16:14.932
Hey, hey, people.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.567
Task force, officially
on the scoreboard

16:16.568 --> 16:19.203
with our first major
giggle pig dealer busted.

16:19.204 --> 16:21.505
[Cheering]

16:21.506 --> 16:22.440
Treat him well.

16:22.441 --> 16:24.008
This guy is sort of the Mitch Globmun

16:24.009 --> 16:25.709
of getting put in jail for this.

16:25.710 --> 16:28.546
Globmun was the first kid
in my grade to get a pube.

16:28.547 --> 16:30.245
Rosa, great news, my friend!

16:30.248 --> 16:31.482
What the hell?

16:31.483 --> 16:32.917
Donger just called
and said you abandoned him,

16:32.918 --> 16:35.352
took information
from a classified computer,

16:35.353 --> 16:37.555
and licked a roll of antique stamps.

16:37.556 --> 16:38.522
The stamps were on me.

16:38.523 --> 16:41.091
I was curious
about how old glue tasted.

16:41.092 --> 16:43.561
Answer: Like a horse lollipop.

16:43.562 --> 16:45.095
Mm.

16:45.096 --> 16:46.864
Look, it's not a big deal.

16:46.865 --> 16:48.999
Donger wanted us to waste
a week staring at mailboxes.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.535
If I'd listened to him, I never
would have caught Delroy.

16:51.536 --> 16:52.643
Or found his books, which tell us

16:52.671 --> 16:55.840
there's a huge giggle pig
shipment coming in tonight.

16:55.841 --> 16:58.075
I told you to work with USPIS.

16:58.076 --> 16:59.076
Okay, I know I didn't do it

16:59.077 --> 17:00.678
exactly the way you asked me to...

17:00.679 --> 17:03.781
The way I ordered you to
as leader of the task force.

17:03.782 --> 17:04.848
Do you think just because we're friends

17:04.849 --> 17:06.250
you can do whatever you want?

17:06.251 --> 17:07.952
Donger's furious.
He's on his way over here now

17:07.953 --> 17:08.953
because they're taking over the case.

17:08.954 --> 17:10.554
What!
He can't do that.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.589
Yeah, he can.

17:11.589 --> 17:12.990
They're a federal agency.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.358
From now on,
any bust that comes from this,

17:14.358 --> 17:16.861
including Delroy, goes to USPIS.

17:16.862 --> 17:19.063
My task force gets nothing.
So thanks, friend.

17:21.503 --> 17:24.769
This table tastes like
Scully's elbow blisters.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.904
It's horrible and I deserve it.

17:26.905 --> 17:29.140
I hate seeing you like this.

17:29.141 --> 17:31.041
Rosa has every right
to be pissed at me.

17:31.076 --> 17:34.812
I didn't follow her orders
and I messed up the task force.

17:34.813 --> 17:36.013
The only way to make things right

17:36.014 --> 17:38.616
is to do the worst,
most awful thing imaginable.

17:38.617 --> 17:40.317
Dip your penis in vinegar.

17:40.318 --> 17:41.385
What?
No!

17:41.386 --> 17:42.653
Why would you say that?

17:42.654 --> 17:43.754
In Sunday school, they told us

17:43.755 --> 17:46.190
the Babylonians did that
to their enemies.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.892
I've been terrified ever since.

17:47.893 --> 17:53.030
Okay, well, what I have to do
is far, far worse.

17:53.064 --> 17:55.299
I'm sorry I was a jerk.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.402
I'm sorry I said
<i>the postman</i> was a flop.

17:58.403 --> 18:01.105
I'm sorry I said
"forever" stamps are a lie

18:01.106 --> 18:04.241
because the earth will eventually
be swallowed by the sun.

18:04.242 --> 18:05.810
I know what you're trying to do

18:05.811 --> 18:08.245
and I'm not buying it for a second.

18:08.246 --> 18:10.981
I don't think you're sorry and
I don't think you respect USPIS.

18:10.982 --> 18:14.051
Maybe at first,
but that was before I read,

18:14.052 --> 18:16.220
"stamping out crime:
A history of the USPIS."

18:16.221 --> 18:17.811
Oh, great read!

18:17.823 --> 18:19.056
Yeah.

18:19.057 --> 18:20.257
But it actually just scratches
the surface.

18:20.258 --> 18:21.859
The real story begins
in the 16th century

18:21.860 --> 18:25.096
with <i>la poste Francaise.</i>

18:25.097 --> 18:26.263
Do you wanna hear about it?

18:26.264 --> 18:29.066
Absolutely.
Please tell us that story.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.568
And spare no detail.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.569
The vinegar dip.

18:33.618 --> 18:37.072
But this is when USPIS history
gets really good.

18:37.107 --> 18:38.574
They actually moved the headquarters

18:38.575 --> 18:41.376
back to Boston
from Washington D.C.

18:41.378 --> 18:43.045
Let's jump ahead to 1820...

18:43.046 --> 18:45.347
Wait, you're just gonna jump
a whole decade?

18:45.348 --> 18:46.548
I mean, I'm dying to know

18:46.549 --> 18:48.450
how the chief postal
inspector's sickly wife

18:48.451 --> 18:51.954
adjusted to the cold
new England winters.

18:51.955 --> 18:53.756
Okay, Peralta, I accept your apology.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.024
You can have the case back.

18:55.025 --> 18:56.025
Oh, thank you.

18:56.026 --> 18:57.459
Truth is, I need some help.

18:57.460 --> 18:59.194
Delroy won't tell us where
the shipment's going tonight

18:59.195 --> 19:01.563
and his notebooks are all in code.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.732
Have a look.

19:03.733 --> 19:05.501
Have you checked out this phone number?

19:05.502 --> 19:06.535
It doesn't exist.

19:06.536 --> 19:09.004
Ten digits, what else could it be?

19:09.005 --> 19:10.439
Two zip codes back-to-back.

19:10.440 --> 19:11.740
But they're nowhere near here.

19:11.741 --> 19:15.611
27889, that's Washington,
North Carolina.

19:15.612 --> 19:20.182
80751, that's Sterling, Colorado.

19:20.183 --> 19:22.418
Sterling Place and Washington Avenue.

19:22.419 --> 19:25.821
Wait a minute, Mr. Postman!

19:25.822 --> 19:28.023
That's where the giggle pig
delivery's gonna be?

19:28.024 --> 19:31.960
Yup.
We gotta go, right now.

19:31.961 --> 19:34.096
Could you please knock it off?

19:34.097 --> 19:39.435
It's like working inside a beaver dam.

19:39.436 --> 19:41.937
Oh no, a next-to-desk-sit-down.

19:41.938 --> 19:44.640
Santiago, you're putting yourself
under too much pressure.

19:44.641 --> 19:47.142
And that stress is making it
even harder for you to quit.

19:47.143 --> 19:48.577
Some things might come easier to you

19:48.578 --> 19:50.746
if you stop being such a perfectionist.

19:50.747 --> 19:55.284
A concept you should become
familiar with.

19:55.285 --> 19:56.452
"Familiar with?"

19:56.453 --> 19:57.419
Mm.

19:57.420 --> 19:58.420
A dangling preposition?

19:58.421 --> 20:00.456
I'm setting an example.

20:00.457 --> 20:03.625
I made an error and I'm not
going to correct it.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.528
I'm just gonna let it dangle...

20:06.529 --> 20:07.963
Dangle...

20:07.964 --> 20:11.934
Dangle.

20:11.935 --> 20:13.702
Thank you, Captain.

20:13.703 --> 20:15.170
Okay, get ready, it's going down.

20:15.171 --> 20:16.839
Wait, before we go in there...

20:16.840 --> 20:18.007
Apology accepted.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.842
No, I actually want to do it.

20:19.843 --> 20:20.909
Ugh, so I have to suffer?

20:20.944 --> 20:22.578
I'll make it quick.

20:22.579 --> 20:23.679
I didn't follow your orders,

20:23.680 --> 20:26.982
I took advantage of our friendship,
I'm a jerk, I'm sorry.

20:26.983 --> 20:28.383
So that's what eternity feels like.

20:28.385 --> 20:30.419
I could not have made that any shorter.

20:30.420 --> 20:32.621
All right, what's the plan?
This dong is ready to ding.

20:32.622 --> 20:33.789
What?

20:33.790 --> 20:35.257
TAC team one will take
the north entrance.

20:35.258 --> 20:36.692
TAC team two will take the east door.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.227
Jake, you stay out here
and man the radio.

20:38.228 --> 20:40.562
Oh, sure, whatever you need.
On it.

20:40.563 --> 20:42.698
No, I'm just kidding,
you're coming in with us.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.624
Jerk.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.267
(Rosa) Ready?
On my count.

20:45.268 --> 20:49.471
Three, two, one.

20:49.472 --> 20:50.606
(Rosa) Freeze, police!

20:50.607 --> 20:53.008
(Danger) Also USPIS.
And USPIS.

20:53.009 --> 20:54.710
Down, down, down!

20:54.711 --> 20:56.178
Go out the back door!

20:56.179 --> 20:57.780
(Rosa) Down, down, get down!

20:57.814 --> 20:59.348
Unh!

20:59.349 --> 21:01.417
Hands on your head!

21:05.422 --> 21:07.890
Unh.
What happened?

21:07.891 --> 21:08.991
You hit your head
on the doorway coming in.

21:08.992 --> 21:10.125
Got knocked out cold.

21:10.126 --> 21:11.260
Do I have a bruise?

21:11.261 --> 21:12.494
A little one.

21:12.495 --> 21:15.064
Yes! I'm going on the wall
of heroes.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.332
Did we catch all the bad guys?

21:16.333 --> 21:17.666
Yup, we got 'em.

21:17.667 --> 21:19.902
All right, another win for USPIS.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.437
You're lying in rat turds.

21:21.438 --> 21:22.504
It's all part of the job,
little brother.

21:22.505 --> 21:24.473
It's all part of the job.
