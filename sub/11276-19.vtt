All right, Cliff, seeing    
  as how I'm your best friend,

00:21.821 --> 00:24.188
I guess you better tell me      
      what the problem is.

00:24.256 --> 00:26.925
Ah, you're only asking me   
    'cause you lost the toss.

00:26.993 --> 00:30.195
No, he's only your best friend 
because he lost the toss.

00:31.564 --> 00:33.264
Eh, fine, here,
             go ahead and laugh.

00:33.332 --> 00:34.499

                      and laugh.

Oh, as you you may
                have guessed,

this is a hybrid cross between
          a rutabaga and a beet.

00:46.846 --> 00:48.880

poke holes in this thing,

00:53.820 --> 00:56.822
or even touch it,               
actually,

00:56.889 --> 00:59.291
but really, I mean,             
how useful do you think

00:59.358 --> 01:00.959
this is going to be?

01:01.027 --> 01:02.110
Are you kidding, Norm?

01:02.178 --> 01:03.611
This is a perfect   
                    vegetable

    rutabagas but love beets.

dozens of those, right?

That's why those faceless   
    bureaucrats in Washington

01:14.857 --> 01:16.691
are trying to steal it
                away from me.

    I'd like you all to sign

    of the beetabaga.

                  You got a pen?

Cliff.                  
                     Yeah?

01:29.104 --> 01:30.972
Remember when, uh,              
you asked me to tell you

01:31.040 --> 01:33.041
if you were going off

01:33.108 --> 01:34.708
Yeah.

to come all the way down here  
     and tell me in person.

04:29.084 --> 04:31.886

spend more time together,

04:31.954 --> 04:33.654
see each other face to face,

04:33.722 --> 04:37.391
I'll learn what the attraction 
      is for my daughter.

Nope.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.050

05:00.482 --> 05:02.116
and nobody even notices me.

05:02.184 --> 05:04.285
As usual, I am just ignored.

05:04.353 --> 05:07.088
But I finally figured out why.

05:07.156 --> 05:09.874
I am just too   
              darned attractive.

05:11.309 --> 05:13.962
Guys really hate that.

05:14.029 --> 05:15.763
You know, the problem   
            is that everybody

05:15.831 --> 05:18.532
just sees me            
        as a sex kitten.

05:18.600 --> 05:19.917
I hate that.

05:19.985 --> 05:23.754
I think I need to find          
a new role model.

05:23.822 --> 05:26.091
If only I knew one              
successful career woman

05:26.158 --> 05:30.861

no sexual appeal whatsoever.

05:45.277 --> 05:46.677
or the 20 pounds of water

05:46.745 --> 05:51.332
I'm retaining          
in my fingers and ankles?

05:51.400 --> 05:53.868
Lilith, Lilith,         
I love the way you dress.

05:53.935 --> 05:56.104
I admire your style.

05:56.171 --> 05:57.539
Do you
                      think that

05:57.606 --> 06:01.976
um, you could help me develop  
a more business-like appearance?

06:02.044 --> 06:03.711
I'd love to, Rebecca.

06:03.779 --> 06:06.947
And may I say          
it's about time you asked.

06:07.015 --> 06:08.299
There are two

06:08.367 --> 06:09.650
approaches a woman can take

06:09.718 --> 06:11.535
in turning her look       
    to her advantage.

06:11.603 --> 06:14.238
The first is to play upon       
     the male sexual drive

06:14.339 --> 06:16.607
and turn yourself           
into an object of desire.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.759
I have opted for the second.

06:18.827 --> 06:19.493
What's that?

06:19.561 --> 06:22.763
Scaring them stupid.

06:22.831 --> 06:25.099

06:25.166 --> 06:27.368
So, Woods, what did Mr. Big
     want to talk to you about?

06:27.436 --> 06:29.103
He still sweating you out 
      about seeing his daughter?

06:29.170 --> 06:31.189
I bet he offered you      
        a couple of thou

06:31.257 --> 06:33.524
to keep your mitts off     
the airhead to the throne.

                do it, Woody.

Money is no substitute for
      the love of a good woman.

06:38.380 --> 06:41.849
Now real estate, especially
            in today's market...

06:41.916 --> 06:43.917
No, no, no.           
You guys are way off base.

06:43.985 --> 06:45.753
I didn't think Mr. Gaines       
        liked me either,

06:45.820 --> 06:48.389

to Kelly's birthday party.

going to have

06:50.976 --> 06:52.176
to get her a present, Wood.

06:52.244 --> 06:54.012
I know, Carla.
          I'm prepared for this.

06:54.079 --> 06:56.280
And I'm not just giving
                her any present,

06:56.348 --> 06:57.982
but the gift
            that makes us all

06:58.050 --> 06:59.784
a little bit happier    
            to be alive.

I'm giving her <i>The Really Big</i>  
      <i>Book of Dutch Humor.</i>

07:11.196 --> 07:12.563
( <i>laughing</i> )

07:12.631 --> 07:15.332
See, it works.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.135
Woody, you know,                
everybody at the party

07:17.202 --> 07:19.203
is going to be richer than God.

07:19.271 --> 07:22.040
If you walk in there and        
show them a stupid book

07:22.107 --> 07:23.641
full of tulip jokes,

07:23.709 --> 07:26.410
they're going to laugh          
in your face.

07:26.478 --> 07:29.180
That's kind of 
                the idea, Carla.

07:34.319 --> 07:36.353
Woody, I think Kelly might      
be used to gifts

07:36.421 --> 07:37.922
a little bit more expensive.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.074
Well, then why did          
     the father invite me?

07:40.142 --> 07:42.076
He knows I can't        
     afford anything ritzy.

07:42.144 --> 07:44.078
Well, maybe that's              
his plan, Woody.

07:44.146 --> 07:47.715
Maybe he wants to humiliate you 
in front of Kelly's friends,

07:47.783 --> 07:50.718
so she'll be too embarrassed    
to date you anymore.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.788
Maybe I won't even go.

07:53.856 --> 07:56.791
Maybe I'll just stay home this
weekend and work on my hair.

07:56.859 --> 07:58.526
Sam?

07:58.593 --> 08:00.762
Yeah.

08:00.829 --> 08:03.397
I could help you out.

08:03.465 --> 08:10.371
You know, you got a wave there 
  that's just going to waste.

08:10.438 --> 08:11.772

Before Mr. Jacques
            combs you out...

08:15.677 --> 08:16.894
...could you come here?

08:21.166 --> 08:23.534
Woody, you're giving up     
          too easily.

          plenty to offer Kelly.

no rich man can obtain,

08:31.276 --> 08:33.744
upon which no price
                     can be set.

08:33.812 --> 08:36.580
Great idea, Dr. Crane.

08:36.648 --> 08:39.216
I can't tell you actually   
        what to do of course,

08:39.284 --> 08:41.717
but I can relate a story
        from my own experience.

08:41.785 --> 08:44.288
I remember when I was   
      courting a certain beauty,

08:44.356 --> 08:46.390
I wrote her a poem.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.759
Of course, it was no great
            piece of literature,

08:48.827 --> 08:50.761
but it did express
        my feelings honestly.

08:50.829 --> 08:53.130
I recall reciting the last
             lines while we were

08:53.198 --> 08:56.033
sitting in front of the fire,   
            basking in our love.

08:56.101 --> 08:59.103
"Your lips are the flame    
        that consumes me

08:59.171 --> 09:01.538
and the candle
            that lights my way."

09:01.606 --> 09:02.639
Frasier, love.

09:02.707 --> 09:03.907
Yes, dearest?

09:03.976 --> 09:06.277
I've never heard that           
drivel before in my life.

09:12.951 --> 09:15.619
I wonder whose lips those were.

09:20.792 --> 09:24.512
( <i>indistinct conversations</i> )

09:28.617 --> 09:31.819
Wow, Kelly,
            that's beautiful.

09:31.887 --> 09:34.555
Come on, Uncle Val, I know you. 
        What's the gag?

09:34.623 --> 09:35.673
Look inside.

09:36.958 --> 09:40.161
Yeah, a new Mercedes!

09:40.228 --> 09:43.230
Thank you.

09:43.298 --> 09:44.649
Well, that looks
                like that's it.

09:44.716 --> 09:47.084
What say we all go outside

09:47.152 --> 09:49.520
and have a look         
  at some of Kelly's new cars?

09:52.157 --> 09:53.524
Wait, everybody.

09:53.591 --> 09:55.893
Woody hasn't given me           
his present yet.

09:55.961 --> 09:56.994
Oh.

09:57.062 --> 09:58.796
That's right, Kelly.

09:58.864 --> 10:01.032
Uh, could you          
     come stand over here?

10:01.950 --> 10:03.234
I'd like to sing you

10:03.302 --> 10:04.935
a little song  
                I wrote for you.

10:08.273 --> 10:10.274
Now I should tell 
             you right up front,

10:10.342 --> 10:12.510
that I'm not really     
          a professional singer.

10:12.577 --> 10:14.345
I'm more of a vocal stylist.

10:14.413 --> 10:15.813
The song, Woody.

10:15.881 --> 10:16.697
Oh, right.

10:22.387 --> 10:28.392
( <i>plays sweetly</i> )

10:28.460 --> 10:33.564
¶ Kelly, my darling,       
     you are my sunshine ¶

10:36.184 --> 10:40.338
¶ When we're together      
         I feel fine ¶

10:43.224 --> 10:46.877
¶ Your smile is so lovely,      
    your hair is so clean ¶

10:46.945 --> 10:53.651
¶ You make me feel that     
the whole world is mine ¶

10:56.154 --> 10:58.322
¶ Kelly, Kelly,         
     Kelly, Kelly, Kelly ¶

10:58.390 --> 11:01.592
¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,  
     Kelly, Kelly, Kelly ¶

11:01.660 --> 11:03.428
¶ K-E-L-L-Y

11:03.495 --> 11:07.131
¶ Why? Because you're      
     Kelly, Kelly, Kelly ¶

11:07.198 --> 11:09.483
¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

11:09.551 --> 11:15.739
¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly,  
 Kelly, Kelly, Kelly of mine ¶

11:15.807 --> 11:18.742
( <i>soft applause </i> )

11:18.810 --> 11:21.845
¶ Mine, mine, mine, mine,       
mine, mine, mine, mine ¶

11:21.914 --> 11:29.086
¶ Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine, 
mine, mine, mine, mine. ¶

11:29.154 --> 11:32.656
( <i>song ends</i> )

11:38.896 --> 11:40.681
Oh, Woody, that was beautiful.

11:40.749 --> 11:41.782
You really liked it?

11:41.850 --> 11:43.650
Oh, I liked it         
      more than anything.

11:43.719 --> 11:44.484
Thanks.

11:44.552 --> 11:46.854
So, where's my gift?

11:57.048 --> 11:59.500
Woody, I think you ought    
          to lay off.

11:59.568 --> 12:01.469
How many have you had?

12:01.537 --> 12:04.222
Eleven.

12:04.289 --> 12:06.290
11 beers?

12:06.358 --> 12:07.741
11 sips.

12:10.028 --> 12:12.195
Well, that's...

12:12.263 --> 12:13.647
that's plenty, Woody.

12:13.715 --> 12:16.183
You know, booze is no way   
        to handle any problems.

12:16.251 --> 12:19.286
I just can't get over that Kelly
     made a fool out of me

12:19.354 --> 12:20.654
in front of all         
         those people.

12:20.722 --> 12:22.122
So you just left, huh?

12:22.190 --> 12:23.674
What else could I do?

12:23.742 --> 12:27.711
I told her my present           
was out front and ran off.

12:27.780 --> 12:29.546
Don't worry about it, Wood.

12:29.614 --> 12:31.515
It happens to all of us.

12:31.583 --> 12:32.866
Really?

12:32.934 --> 12:34.935
Did Mrs. Peterson ever     
     make a fool out of you

12:35.003 --> 12:36.470
in front of other people?

12:36.538 --> 12:40.007
Yeah, there was that time she  
pulled the old "I do" gag.

12:43.712 --> 12:47.081
I just never expected      
        this from Kelly.

12:47.148 --> 12:48.816
I'm really mad at her.

12:48.883 --> 12:51.118
She's just a rich...

12:51.186 --> 12:52.820
a rich...

12:52.887 --> 12:55.339
I'd like to call her      
         a nasty name,

12:55.406 --> 12:59.143
but I can't think of anything  
     that rhymes with rich.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.112
You know, Woody, you're better 
        off dumping her.

13:02.180 --> 13:04.148
Rich people stink.

13:04.216 --> 13:05.916
I hate them.

13:05.984 --> 13:07.684
I hate their soft shoes...

13:07.752 --> 13:10.988
the way they're too relaxed   
        to sweat.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.824
You know what I hate most about 
          rich people?

13:13.892 --> 13:16.160
I'm not one of them.

13:16.228 --> 13:19.330
Yeah, Carla, you sweat
        like a longshoreman.

13:27.072 --> 13:29.740
Woody, I think you ought        
to give her a second chance.

13:29.807 --> 13:31.909
I mean, Kelly doesn't know      
what she's doing here.

13:31.976 --> 13:33.344
She was born rich.

13:33.412 --> 13:35.746
All her school friends
                    are rich.

13:35.813 --> 13:37.798
You know, maybe she just        
can't imagine someone

13:37.865 --> 13:40.267
who can't afford                
something expensive.

13:40.335 --> 13:41.868
Did you explain it to her?

13:41.936 --> 13:44.405
What's the use?         
     I don't care anymore.

13:44.472 --> 13:45.739
Don't be bitter.

13:45.807 --> 13:47.375
I'm not bitter, Sam.

13:47.442 --> 13:49.943
I'm just consumed           
    by a gnawing hate

13:50.011 --> 13:51.562
that's eating away at my gut

13:51.629 --> 13:53.931
until I can taste the bile      
          in my mouth.

13:55.850 --> 13:59.186
Well, I guess I am a little   
            bitter.

13:59.254 --> 14:01.621
Either that or I'm coming down 
        with something.

14:01.689 --> 14:04.207
Does anybody have a Tic Tac?

14:11.132 --> 14:12.733
( <i>knocking</i> )

14:14.669 --> 14:15.970
Where's Rebecca?

14:16.037 --> 14:17.070
In changing.

14:17.138 --> 14:18.806
I'm helping her         
    remake her image.

14:18.874 --> 14:20.508
We're planning to crash
                 the power lunch

14:20.575 --> 14:22.075
going on right now
                  at Melville's,

14:22.143 --> 14:23.511
to show those executives

14:23.578 --> 14:25.913
what a real, no-nonsense    
    businesswoman looks like.

14:25.981 --> 14:27.280
What does she look like?

14:27.348 --> 14:29.383
Miss Howe?

14:34.672 --> 14:35.956
Oh, a man.

14:37.075 --> 14:38.492
Carla, stop 
                interrupting.

14:38.526 --> 14:42.129
Lilith is trying to teach me how
to be a hard-ass businesswoman.

14:42.196 --> 14:43.831
The pretzel man wants      
          to see you.

14:43.899 --> 14:45.265
You talk to him.

14:45.333 --> 14:46.634
He scares me.

14:47.935 --> 14:49.837
You look wonderful, Rebecca.
                    Thank you.

14:49.905 --> 14:51.372
Can you breathe in that thing?

14:51.439 --> 14:53.107
I'm a little constricted.

14:53.174 --> 14:54.808
Perhaps it's the tight collar.

14:54.876 --> 14:58.462
Or the ace bandage strapped   
    around my breasts.

14:58.529 --> 15:01.214
Well, they interfered with      
    the line of your jacket.

15:01.282 --> 15:03.567
What do you think, Carla?

15:03.635 --> 15:04.969
Well, turn around.

15:06.471 --> 15:08.905
Bind her butt, too.

15:11.376 --> 15:13.494
Are you ready

15:13.561 --> 15:15.362
to sock it              
to the old boy's network?

15:15.430 --> 15:16.163
I am!

15:16.231 --> 15:17.597
Too much inflection.

15:17.665 --> 15:18.265
I am.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.283
I am proud of you.

15:25.123 --> 15:28.993
Geez, two Liliths.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.595
This is like a nightmare    
          I had once.

15:31.662 --> 15:32.963
You, too?

15:36.568 --> 15:38.502
Well, that cuts it.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.770
The whole world's against me.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.738
What's the problem, Cliffie?

15:41.806 --> 15:43.441
Oh, those boneheads down    
         at McDonald's

15:43.508 --> 15:45.242
refuse to consider the obvious 
        commercial value

15:45.310 --> 15:48.763
of Mcbeetabaga burgers.

15:50.598 --> 15:52.199
For God's sake, are you
            still going on about

15:52.267 --> 15:53.934
your stupid vegetable?

15:54.001 --> 15:55.603
It's not my vegetable, Norm.

15:55.670 --> 15:56.903
It belongs to the whole world.

15:56.971 --> 15:59.440
Aren't you vegetable enough   
         for the world?

15:59.507 --> 16:00.624
Now you are going               
to be doubting

16:00.692 --> 16:02.293
on the other side               
of your mouth pretty soon.

16:02.361 --> 16:04.628
You know, I went
                home last night

16:04.696 --> 16:06.447
and fooled around in            
the kitchen a little bit,

16:06.514 --> 16:08.848
and I came up with some         
mouthwatering morsels here.

16:08.916 --> 16:10.817
Come on, who's going      
        to be the first

16:10.885 --> 16:12.186
to try some of these goodies?

16:12.253 --> 16:13.520
We have beetabaga brittle,

16:13.588 --> 16:16.390
beetabaga burritos and that     
little taste of Cairo,

16:16.458 --> 16:18.392
beetabaga fajita in a pita.

16:21.563 --> 16:23.530
How about a beetabaga   
                    barf bag?

16:27.318 --> 16:29.052
I'd like to try one.      
             May I?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.572
Sure, you certainly may.

16:31.640 --> 16:33.440
You certainly may.

16:33.508 --> 16:35.108
A man with a sense of adventure.

16:35.176 --> 16:37.711
Here you go, sir.

16:39.347 --> 16:40.914
Mm.

16:40.982 --> 16:43.016
Oh, this is delicious.

16:43.084 --> 16:45.286
Yeah, yeah?                     
Not too chalky?

16:45.353 --> 16:46.553
No,

16:46.621 --> 16:48.955
I really like the unusual   
                     aftertaste.

16:49.023 --> 16:51.625
Yeah, that'll stay with         
you for a couple of days.

16:51.693 --> 16:53.594
Now listen up down there.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.796
This fine gentleman can         
teach you something.

16:55.863 --> 16:57.164
You know, I plan    
              to tell the people

16:57.231 --> 16:58.299
back where
             I work about these.

16:58.366 --> 16:59.633
Oh, hey, hear that?

16:59.701 --> 17:01.368
And I should know   
    something on the subject,

17:01.436 --> 17:04.069
as I not only have a degree
                 in agriculture,

17:04.137 --> 17:06.071
but I'm also a graduate
             of the Cordon Bleu.

17:06.140 --> 17:08.275
The man is an expert.

17:08.343 --> 17:10.042
I'm also an astronaut.

17:10.111 --> 17:12.112
Wow.

17:12.180 --> 17:15.683
Next week I'm going to be   
             the Queen of Spain.

17:23.223 --> 17:26.259
Hey, uh, Fras, could you use    
another patient?

17:26.327 --> 17:28.178
Oh, Cliff, you're harmless.

17:29.764 --> 17:31.865
Yeah, there's only              
one thing left to do.

17:31.933 --> 17:33.367
I'll just take this             
to the public.

17:34.869 --> 17:37.838
Beetabaga fajita on a pita?

17:37.905 --> 17:40.273
<i>No habla espanol, senor.</i>

17:45.847 --> 17:47.548
Woody, are you okay?

17:47.615 --> 17:50.083
I was afraid something awful    
had happened to you.

17:50.151 --> 17:51.685
Yeah, well, maybe it did.

17:51.753 --> 17:54.054
I kept waiting for you to come 
    back to the party,

17:54.121 --> 17:56.256
and at first I just figured   
         you'd gone out

17:56.324 --> 17:58.859
on to the front lawn and got  
     lost, like last week.

17:58.926 --> 18:01.027
But now I know something's      
             wrong.

18:01.095 --> 18:02.462
I'll tell you what's wrong.

18:02.530 --> 18:04.364
I don't have a gift for you.

18:04.432 --> 18:05.799
So why don't you just leave?

18:05.867 --> 18:08.635
Okay, Woody, if that's     
         what you want.

18:09.821 --> 18:11.454
No, wait, Kelly.

18:11.522 --> 18:15.058
It's not what I want, but you   
have to understand something.

18:15.126 --> 18:17.194
I'm just a poor working guy.

18:17.262 --> 18:19.997
Could we go someplace and talk?

18:20.064 --> 18:22.099
I can't leave now.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.133
Why not?

18:23.201 --> 18:24.902
I have a job.

18:24.969 --> 18:27.905
I know, I think                 
that's so cute.

18:27.972 --> 18:29.606
I don't work to be cute.

18:29.674 --> 18:31.141
I work to make money to live.

18:31.209 --> 18:32.342
The cute part just happens.

18:34.045 --> 18:35.245
Don't you understand?

18:35.313 --> 18:37.615
I'm trying, Woody.

18:37.682 --> 18:40.050
There are some gifts you
              can't put in a box

18:40.118 --> 18:42.520
or hold in your hand.

18:42.587 --> 18:45.022
Kelly, the song was my gift.

18:45.089 --> 18:48.292
Oh, I get it, the song is       
        a riddle, right?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.760
And if I can figure it out

18:49.827 --> 18:51.828
it'll tell me where you've      
        hidden my gift.

18:52.997 --> 18:56.099
I think we're just
                  too different.

18:56.167 --> 18:58.702
I don't think we should see
             each other anymore.

18:58.769 --> 18:59.903
Really?

18:59.971 --> 19:01.221
Really.

19:01.289 --> 19:05.025
I guess there isn't anything  
          else to say.

19:10.615 --> 19:12.749
Well, I'm sorry, man.

19:12.817 --> 19:14.618
But what were you           
        supposed to do?

19:14.686 --> 19:17.354
You know, run out   
         and empty your savings,

19:17.422 --> 19:20.390
hock everything you own, spend
every penny you ever earned

19:20.458 --> 19:22.859
just to buy her a silly 
        little piece of jewelry?

19:22.927 --> 19:25.328
Sam, that's a great idea.

19:25.397 --> 19:26.797
No, Woody.

19:26.865 --> 19:28.832
And I always thought      
      I was the smart one.

19:32.353 --> 19:34.154
( <i>grunting</i> )

19:42.897 --> 19:44.497
How'd it go?

19:44.565 --> 19:45.933
Well, not bad.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.101
If I choose to accept      
          their offer,

19:48.169 --> 19:49.669
you're looking at           
     the new vice president

19:49.737 --> 19:52.105
in charge of          
     the Eastern Seaboard.

19:52.173 --> 19:53.306
She's lying.

19:53.374 --> 19:55.475
I'm the vice president          
of the Eastern Seaboard.

19:55.543 --> 19:57.778
Now I am the Eastern Seaboard.

19:57.845 --> 19:59.312
What a view!

20:10.191 --> 20:12.275
( <i>playing note on piano</i> )       
 ¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly

20:12.343 --> 20:15.529
¶ Kelly, Kelly, Kelly...

20:18.333 --> 20:19.366
Hi, Kelly.

20:20.434 --> 20:22.035
Happy birthday.

20:22.103 --> 20:25.638
I thought you never wanted      
        to see me again.

20:25.706 --> 20:28.024
Oh, that was just a joke.

20:28.092 --> 20:30.394
You know my crazy Dutch humor.

20:33.264 --> 20:35.265
Here.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.535
Oh, Woody, you didn't have to.

20:41.839 --> 20:44.674
Oh, it's a pendant.

20:44.742 --> 20:47.744
It's a little opal        
      surrounded by sand.

20:47.812 --> 20:49.379
Those are crushed diamonds.

20:51.516 --> 20:52.750
I like it.

20:52.817 --> 20:54.484
Where's the chain?

20:54.552 --> 20:59.123
Well, I'll have that for you  
  in another 18 easy payments.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.925
Well, let's go
                get it now.

21:01.993 --> 21:03.593
We'll take my new Lamborghini.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.996
It only has                     
three miles on it.

21:06.064 --> 21:07.464
We can't go get it now.

21:07.532 --> 21:08.999
I don't have any money.

21:09.067 --> 21:11.802
Oh, we can just stop by your  
  automatic teller on the way.

21:11.870 --> 21:14.321
Kelly, when I say I don't   
                 have any money,

21:14.388 --> 21:15.689
I don't have any money.

21:15.757 --> 21:19.193
Nothing in my shoe,
      nothing under my mattress.

21:19.260 --> 21:20.360
Nothing.

21:20.428 --> 21:22.262
You take all the money
                in all the world

21:22.330 --> 21:23.430
and get rid of it

21:23.497 --> 21:25.365
and that's how much
                money I have.

21:26.884 --> 21:29.553
Wait a minute.

21:31.322 --> 21:33.990
You can't afford this, can you?

21:35.426 --> 21:38.728
That's why you've               
been so upset.

21:38.796 --> 21:40.464
Now I understand.

21:40.531 --> 21:45.202
It's like when Daddy wanted   
 to buy Shell Oil and couldn't.

21:47.354 --> 21:50.924
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

21:50.992 --> 21:54.061
You know,                       
this is really sweet,           
but I can't accept it

21:54.128 --> 21:55.596
if it's going to hurt you.

21:55.663 --> 21:58.398
Thanks, Kelly.

21:58.466 --> 22:01.151
I feel really bad about this.

22:01.218 --> 22:02.886
No, I'm the one.

22:05.189 --> 22:08.224
You see, I just wanted          
to give you something

22:08.292 --> 22:09.492
that nobody else could,

22:09.561 --> 22:11.662
and I know I couldn't compete   
with your friends

22:11.729 --> 22:15.465
when it came to expensive stuff,
so I tried that dorky song.

22:15.533 --> 22:17.200
It was pretty.

22:17.268 --> 22:19.002
The tune or the words?

22:19.070 --> 22:20.837
The words especially.

22:20.905 --> 22:24.074
Good, 'cause I sort       
    of ripped off the tune.

22:24.141 --> 22:27.110
I liked it.

22:27.178 --> 22:29.896
Well, gee, there is one other  
  thing I wanted to give you,

22:29.964 --> 22:32.032
and maybe it's even       
     better than the song.

22:32.099 --> 22:33.667
No one else in the world has it.

22:33.734 --> 22:35.835
What's that?

22:35.903 --> 22:38.605
Just...

22:38.673 --> 22:40.840
I love you.

22:50.518 --> 22:54.504
You're not going to say         
"where's my gift," are you?

22:54.572 --> 22:58.842
Oh, Woody, you make me
                feel so ashamed.

23:00.745 --> 23:04.247
Your gift makes all those   
        others seem so cheap.

23:04.315 --> 23:06.266
Look, Kelly, you're the best    
girl in the whole world.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.035
And to think that           
    for your birthday

23:08.102 --> 23:10.003
I was going to get          
         you a Porsche.

23:15.042 --> 23:19.613
Talk about shallow.

23:19.680 --> 23:24.668
All you really need is to hear 
  me say that I love you, too.

23:29.256 --> 23:30.991
Woody?

23:32.977 --> 23:34.895
Woody?

23:36.330 --> 23:39.632
I'm sorry, did you say          
something after Porsche?
