WEBVTT

00:26.860 --> 00:28.320
It's just right up these stairs.

00:48.340 --> 00:50.217
A little different than your place, huh?

00:53.971 --> 00:56.098
What made you start to suspect my husband?

00:59.560 --> 01:02.729
Anything to do with the fact
that you were sleeping with his wife?

01:16.159 --> 01:18.161
James bought a plane ticket to Portland.

01:18.245 --> 01:20.247
February 11, day before your accident.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.042
The plane manifest
doesn't find his name hereâ€¦

01:26.253 --> 01:27.421
or here.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.007
GPS records from his car,
day of the accident.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.843
James was a half a mile
from the pier that day.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.346
So why don't you arrest him?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.683
Well, that's just the start
of building a case.

01:40.434 --> 01:44.354
He lied about his alibi, red flag.
The rest's just circumstantial.

01:44.938 --> 01:48.066
There's no cameras on the ferries,
so no footage from that day.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.359
No hard proof.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.029
Yet.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.656
What about the motive?

01:54.740 --> 02:00.078
Usually, homicide involving spouses,
motive is money or jealousy.

02:00.913 --> 02:01.914
Us.

02:06.126 --> 02:10.172
And what was "us"?

02:16.094 --> 02:20.182
So, I've been here before?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.477
Yeah.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.355
A lot?

02:27.439 --> 02:28.440
A few times.

02:31.443 --> 02:32.694
What about Marin?

02:33.612 --> 02:35.030
How often did you come?

02:36.865 --> 02:38.575
We were seeing each other a couple months,

02:38.659 --> 02:43.622
and toward the end,
you weren't as careful.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.003
So he knew about us.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.007
I'm doing everything I can
to keep you safe.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.769
I should go.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.065
Look, if he starts to suspect something
or you get a weird feeling,

03:10.148 --> 03:11.942
just get out of there
and call me right away.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.235
Use your burner phone.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.071
Burner phone?

03:54.860 --> 03:55.861
Hey.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.821
Hey.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.657
What are you up to?

04:02.409 --> 04:06.121
You know, just finishing some work.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
You okay?

04:12.503 --> 04:15.631
Yeah, just done in.

04:17.423 --> 04:18.800
Gonna run a bath.

04:18.884 --> 04:20.052
Okay.

05:56.106 --> 05:57.900
Can I bring you a glass of wine?

05:57.983 --> 05:59.359
I'm fine, thanks.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.505
Too late.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.298
I already poured it.

06:22.841 --> 06:23.842
Thanks.

06:33.268 --> 06:35.270
I'm glad that you're relaxing.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.148
You seemed off when you got home.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.445
I was a bit out of sorts.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.532
Yeah.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.204
Saw an accident on the way home.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.374
Motorcycle.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.210
Young guy.

06:59.878 --> 07:05.342
There was a crowd around him,
and I could tell he wasn't moving.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.219
Jesus.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.013
I'm sorry.

07:14.560 --> 07:16.103
Just leave it.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.198
Wait, it's Caroline.
Do you want me to get it?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.243
I'll call her back later.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.291
You know, I--

07:42.588 --> 07:44.756
I talked to her today.

07:45.966 --> 07:49.970
Yeah, I thanked her for going with you
on your little getaway.

07:51.221 --> 07:55.267
She said that you're starting
to remember some things.

07:57.102 --> 07:58.103
Did she?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.064
Yeah.

08:04.818 --> 08:07.362
I mean, that must be really scary.

08:08.071 --> 08:10.782
You know, if things are coming back
around the accident.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.663
I did mention one thing.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.166
A flash I had.

08:20.542 --> 08:21.835
Not sure what it was.

08:22.878 --> 08:26.089
I was younger. A teenager, maybe.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.636
I was riding a horse.

08:32.346 --> 08:33.722
In England?

08:34.806 --> 08:35.890
No idea.

08:44.942 --> 08:49.863
Well, they say that
the oldest memories come back first.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.621
I will leave you to it.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.780
Hey, you want me to drop you
at the hospital?

10:13.864 --> 10:15.240
It's on my way.

10:15.324 --> 10:18.285
I think I'll stroll. It's such a nice day.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.369
Yeah?

10:21.163 --> 10:22.539
- Love you.
- You too.

10:39.640 --> 10:41.558
<i>Leave a message.</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:02.788
Hey, buddy. We got that meeting.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.872
Hey.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.292
What you working on?

11:09.628 --> 11:11.755
It's personal.

11:11.839 --> 11:12.840
I can tell.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.972
Okay. I can't believe Miranda's making
such a big deal out of this whole thing.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.141
It's a healthy number
of zeros we're off here.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.518
Yeah.

11:24.601 --> 11:28.272
- I'll bet you drinks it's Todd's fuckup.
- Fucking Todd.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.649
A hundo says he's let go
by the end of the meeting.

11:30.732 --> 11:32.985
- All right. I'll see you in there.
- Yeah.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.489
Fuck.

11:42.703 --> 11:43.704
Hey.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.290
You must be James Ellis.

11:47.082 --> 11:48.125
And you are?

11:48.208 --> 11:52.129
MacKenzie Isen. Brought on
to conduct the internal investigation.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.964
There's an investigation?

11:54.047 --> 11:56.967
You must have heard
about the money that's unaccounted for.

11:57.050 --> 12:00.762
Yeah, but-- I mean,
I didn't realize it was so unusual.

12:00.846 --> 12:05.058
I mean, you know,
we move so much capital in and out.

12:05.976 --> 12:07.811
It was probably just late reporting.

12:07.895 --> 12:11.690
I mean, some start-up run by a 25-year-old
living on Mountain Dew

12:11.773 --> 12:13.066
forgot to update their paperwork.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.610
Could be.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.820
Or it's a data entry mistake on our end.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.864
Or maybe it's embezzlement.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.408
Haven't had one of those in a while.

12:21.950 --> 12:25.078
I'm talking to all the employees.
Partners on down.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.207
I have you down for this afternoon.
5:00 p.m.

12:30.834 --> 12:33.879
You know what? Tonight's not great.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.506
My--

12:36.340 --> 12:39.718
My wife, she was in an accident
not so long ago.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.387
So I have only been back
at work full-time for a little while now.

12:42.471 --> 12:43.472
So maybe another time.

12:43.555 --> 12:44.932
Sure, no problem.

12:45.516 --> 12:49.520
We'll do first thing in the morning.
How's 8:00 a.m.?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.773
- Yeah.
- Great.

12:59.154 --> 13:01.823
- Good morning, James.
- Hey.

13:32.062 --> 13:33.230
When Big D rolling through?

13:34.857 --> 13:37.442
- Why? Is there a problem?
- Yeah, I'm ready to scale up.

13:38.277 --> 13:40.654
Not if I got to wait around
all day for my supply.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.737
Can I help you?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.698
I was wondering if I could speak
with an officer who was assigned

14:24.781 --> 14:27.701
- to an incident I was involved in.
- What kind of incident?

14:28.911 --> 14:31.663
It was a suicide attempt.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.585
His name is Thomas Baden.
May I speak with him, please?

14:36.668 --> 14:37.669
What's your name?

14:38.170 --> 14:39.588
Sophie Ellis.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.758
Date of the incident?

14:43.509 --> 14:44.676
February 12th.

14:50.724 --> 14:53.810
Well, the officer listed
on the report is Linda Johnson.

14:53.894 --> 14:57.189
Do you want to speak with her?
There's no Officer Baden at this precinct.

14:58.232 --> 15:02.236
Well, can you tell me what precinct
Thomas Baden works at then? It's urgent.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.454
There's no one by that name in the SFPD.

15:13.789 --> 15:14.998
Excuse me?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.334
You must be mistaken.

15:17.417 --> 15:21.046
Whoever Thomas Baden is, ma'am,
he's not a police officer.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.084
Sophie. Sophie, slow down.
Let me talk to you.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.502
I know you're not a cop.

16:01.253 --> 16:03.005
I'm undercover. Narcotics.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.756
That's convenient.

16:05.424 --> 16:06.592
Roger called me.

16:07.092 --> 16:08.468
Guy at the front desk.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.388
Smug look on his face,
uniform a little too tight.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.892
Was he drinking out
of the Sunset Elementary School mug?

16:16.101 --> 16:19.855
His kids go there.
They're cute. You'd like them.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.860
- Were you the officer assigned to my case?
- There is no case.

16:24.943 --> 16:28.447
I'm the case. No one knows
about this except me and you.

16:28.947 --> 16:30.240
So you lied to me.

16:32.367 --> 16:34.328
You should've told me you were undercover.

16:34.411 --> 16:37.789
Actually, an essential element
of being undercover is not telling anyone.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.584
You shouldn't have gone
into a police station asking for me.

16:41.543 --> 16:43.504
Why were you trying to find me?

16:43.587 --> 16:45.172
James do something?

16:47.090 --> 16:50.219
He started asking weird questions.

16:51.053 --> 16:54.598
Wanted to know if I remember things
about the accident.

16:55.349 --> 16:58.018
We were right. He's hiding something.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.187
What else?

17:03.815 --> 17:06.568
I saw the texts between us.

17:09.695 --> 17:13.700
Why didn't you tell me how serious it was?

17:15.702 --> 17:17.204
I didn't think you were ready.

17:18.747 --> 17:22.501
You're right. I wasn't ready before.

17:24.169 --> 17:27.589
It all just seemed like a story
about someone else.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.719
I am ready now.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.227
You want to get something to eat?

17:43.063 --> 17:46.441
So we came here a lot?

17:47.943 --> 17:51.113
Not exactly gonna run into your friends
on this side of town, right?

17:51.196 --> 17:52.197
Right.

17:53.073 --> 17:54.908
You'll like this place. Trust me.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.745
I guess that's a hard thing to do,

17:58.829 --> 18:01.248
considering I know next to nothing
about you.

18:02.958 --> 18:04.209
What do you want to know?

18:05.961 --> 18:08.964
Okay. For starters,
why were you seeing a married woman?

18:11.842 --> 18:13.760
It's a little more complicated than that.

18:14.887 --> 18:17.973
So tell me. No one else can.

18:18.974 --> 18:22.186
You weren't happy with him.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.646
Not for a while.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.191
Why?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.234
Maybe you resented him?

18:30.485 --> 18:32.946
The person he turned you into.
Some rich guy's wife.

18:34.072 --> 18:35.449
Didn't feel like you.

18:36.867 --> 18:37.951
I said that?

18:40.746 --> 18:43.582
Yeah. Pretty much. Why?

18:46.460 --> 18:48.795
It just makes sense.

18:51.548 --> 18:55.969
Everyone's acting like I'm supposed
to be happy with a walk-in closet

18:56.053 --> 19:01.558
and a calendar full of lunches,
but the whole thing feels hollow.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.606
Thank you for telling me the truth.

19:09.149 --> 19:12.277
I didn't realize how many secrets
my marriage was hiding.

19:13.904 --> 19:17.407
Look, I don't have all the answers,
and I don't know the full story. So--

19:17.491 --> 19:20.744
- Of course. I didn't mean to--
- I just want to keep you safe, all right?

19:21.286 --> 19:23.121
All that other stuff, me, youâ€¦

19:23.914 --> 19:25.666
I'm not trying to get back to that.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.003
You know what?

19:31.672 --> 19:34.007
I'm not really hungry after all.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.512
How about we just get a drink?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.226
Yeah. Come on.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.607
Hi, this is James Ellis.

19:50.691 --> 19:53.068
I'm calling to follow up
on my loan application.

19:53.151 --> 19:55.279
I was expecting a phone call
from you guys.

19:55.821 --> 19:58.574
<i>Hi. Yes, I was just about to call you.</i>

19:58.657 --> 20:01.410
<i>Unfortunately,
your application was denied.</i>

20:01.994 --> 20:03.370
<i>Sorry it didn't work out.</i>

20:03.996 --> 20:07.916
Did you get all the--
of the paperwork I sent over?

20:08.000 --> 20:12.212
The assets, investments--

20:12.296 --> 20:13.338
<i>We did.</i>

20:13.422 --> 20:16.425
<i>And our underwriting team also found
you have second mortgages taken out</i>

20:16.508 --> 20:17.759
<i>on both your homes.</i>

20:17.843 --> 20:20.637
<i>In their estimation,
you're too leveraged at this time.</i>

20:20.721 --> 20:24.057
<i>Listen, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Have a good night, Mr. Ellis.</i>

20:26.935 --> 20:28.061
Fuck!

20:30.772 --> 20:31.773
What the fuck?

20:34.193 --> 20:35.360
You all right?

20:35.444 --> 20:36.445
Yeah.

20:38.155 --> 20:39.364
Yeah.

20:40.782 --> 20:42.159
I'm just annoyed, you know?

20:42.242 --> 20:45.078
I've got these two deals
hanging over my head.

20:45.162 --> 20:46.705
Sophie waiting at home.

20:49.708 --> 20:52.461
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

20:54.046 --> 20:55.672
I just need some sleep, that's all.

20:56.632 --> 20:59.259
Okay. See you tomorrow.

20:59.343 --> 21:00.385
Yeah.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.588
What?

21:37.089 --> 21:39.174
How did we even meet?

21:41.718 --> 21:44.263
Members-only club. Lennox House.

21:45.806 --> 21:46.932
Sounds posh.

21:47.891 --> 21:49.351
What were you doing there?

21:50.435 --> 21:53.605
I wasn't.
I was at the pizza joint up the block.

21:54.147 --> 21:57.568
But I had got caught in the rain,

21:57.651 --> 22:01.280
and there I was, just standing outside,
minding my own business,

22:02.239 --> 22:03.907
and out you came in a huff.

22:11.248 --> 22:14.710
I want to thank you all
for everything you do. All of youâ€¦

22:17.087 --> 22:18.338
Yeah. Let's go, you guys.

22:18.422 --> 22:19.423
You okay?

22:22.384 --> 22:24.136
Sorry, you just seem a little upset.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.517
Okay.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.202
I hate this place.

22:51.872 --> 22:52.873
Yeah.

22:54.458 --> 22:55.459
Me too.

23:00.255 --> 23:02.633
Apparently something
had really pissed you off.

23:04.301 --> 23:05.427
What?

23:05.511 --> 23:07.429
You didn't say. I didn't ask.

23:08.055 --> 23:10.057
I said the drinks
in there looked pretty good,

23:10.140 --> 23:12.684
and you told me you knew a spot
where there were better ones.

23:12.768 --> 23:13.810
Really?

23:15.562 --> 23:18.774
That sounds so impulsive.

23:18.857 --> 23:21.360
Yeah, well, that's how it happened.

23:26.323 --> 23:28.075
So, where'd we go?

23:29.284 --> 23:30.285
Here.

23:37.960 --> 23:39.419
What happened after that?

23:40.295 --> 23:43.340
We had a couple of drinks, andâ€¦

23:43.423 --> 23:45.592
Oh, no. I mean, um--

23:47.010 --> 23:53.684
How did one night turn into all this?

23:56.103 --> 23:58.105
I'm not sure I know how to answer that.

24:00.232 --> 24:01.859
We had a lot in common.

24:03.151 --> 24:07.155
Not, like, hobbies and shit.
More like intuition.

24:08.574 --> 24:11.034
Intuition? About what?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.328
There was just a connection.

24:15.247 --> 24:17.332
You didn't have to explain yourself to me.

24:18.625 --> 24:22.754
Other people in your life,
they ask a lot of questions.

24:24.715 --> 24:28.594
Other people, like my husband?

24:36.560 --> 24:37.853
What sort of questions?

24:38.353 --> 24:41.565
Sometimes when you go
through certain things in your past,

24:42.608 --> 24:44.818
the last thing you wanna do
is talk about them.

24:45.819 --> 24:46.820
And so we didn't.

24:52.951 --> 24:54.286
Maybe you're right.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.665
Maybe it is just a story
about someone else.

25:04.213 --> 25:07.007
We don't have to be who we were
to each other before, okay?

25:09.218 --> 25:10.677
Let's just be who we are now.

25:18.685 --> 25:20.479
Play me another song.

25:23.190 --> 25:25.859
Something the old me liked.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.886
Sophie, is that you?

26:37.514 --> 26:38.932
What are you doing here?

26:39.516 --> 26:42.811
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.
I have a spare key.

26:43.770 --> 26:46.857
You gave me a key in case of an emergency.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.567
So, what's the emergency?

26:50.027 --> 26:51.570
I saw you leave the gallery.

26:53.113 --> 26:55.240
I know you heard me
and James on the phone.

26:57.284 --> 26:58.285
And,

26:59.578 --> 27:02.748
Look, I just need you to know
that this was his idea.

27:03.457 --> 27:06.418
To cover it up.
At the time, it made sense.

27:07.169 --> 27:10.380
- Caroline--
- There's a part of the storyâ€¦

27:10.464 --> 27:11.882
I've left out.

27:14.468 --> 27:15.552
Which part?

27:18.347 --> 27:21.266
You and James
were going through a hard time.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.019
Andâ€¦

27:25.812 --> 27:30.734
something happened between me and him.

27:31.777 --> 27:35.280
And it was a stupid fucking mistake.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.117
You stopped talking to me.

27:39.660 --> 27:43.872
You know, we didn't speak
for months before the accident.

27:44.915 --> 27:49.127
And, maybe, if I had been there--

27:49.211 --> 27:52.548
If I had been in your life,
then it wouldn't have happened.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.299
I don't know.

28:00.514 --> 28:01.598
Why did you lie?

28:03.433 --> 28:05.060
I guessâ€¦

28:08.438 --> 28:11.358
because it felt like a second chance.

28:13.443 --> 28:16.864
You'd already erased all our mistakes.

28:18.740 --> 28:20.117
Why relive them?

28:22.452 --> 28:25.873
Only, I realize now
it doesn't work like that.

28:26.623 --> 28:31.170
We can't just pretend we're new people,

28:31.253 --> 28:33.380
and that the past doesn't exist.

28:34.298 --> 28:36.466
'Cause maybe it doesn't for you,

28:36.550 --> 28:41.180
but for the rest of us, it's everywhere.

28:42.848 --> 28:44.725
You mustn't blame yourself.

28:46.643 --> 28:47.936
You're not the reason I--

28:48.020 --> 28:52.024
No, you called meâ€¦ that morning.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.234
What do you mean "that morning"?

28:54.318 --> 28:56.778
From the pier. I didn't answer.

28:58.197 --> 29:02.117
You left a message.
And I am so fucking sorry, Sophie.

29:03.285 --> 29:06.288
I'm so fucking sorry

29:06.371 --> 29:09.124
that I wasn't there for you
when you reached out.

29:09.208 --> 29:11.793
But I never, in a million years, thought--

29:11.877 --> 29:13.003
Do you still have it?

29:13.086 --> 29:14.129
What?

29:14.630 --> 29:16.381
The message. Do you still have it?

29:17.799 --> 29:18.967
Yeah.

29:19.051 --> 29:20.177
Can I hear it?

29:22.304 --> 29:23.680
Do you really wanna do that?

29:27.893 --> 29:29.144
It's there.

29:32.105 --> 29:36.026
<i>Hey, I--
I know we haven't spoken in a while.</i>

29:37.319 --> 29:39.821
<i>I just-- I was with James.</i>

29:40.989 --> 29:43.450
<i>He walked off just now, butâ€¦</i>

29:46.328 --> 29:49.081
<i>I don't know. I feel like I'm going crazy.</i>

29:49.831 --> 29:52.584
<i>Call me if you can. I need your help.</i>

29:58.507 --> 29:59.633
Are you okay?

30:02.052 --> 30:03.178
Yeah.

30:04.137 --> 30:05.973
It's just a lot to process.

30:10.185 --> 30:12.563
Maybe, can you send it to me?

30:13.605 --> 30:16.149
Yeah, I can text it to you, if you want.

30:18.318 --> 30:21.196
Don't tell James about this, all right?

30:22.489 --> 30:26.243
He needs to tell me, but on his own terms.

30:26.326 --> 30:27.494
Of course.

30:28.537 --> 30:30.205
I am so sorry.

30:43.844 --> 30:47.514
<i>Hey, I--
I know we haven't spoken in a while.</i>

30:48.932 --> 30:51.476
<i>I just-- I was with James.</i>

30:52.603 --> 30:54.688
<i>He walked off just now, butâ€¦</i>

30:57.983 --> 31:00.819
<i>I don't know. I feel like I'm going crazy.</i>

31:01.486 --> 31:04.531
<i>Call me if you can. I need your help.</i>

31:04.615 --> 31:05.616
Babe?

31:09.286 --> 31:10.954
You just back from a run?

31:12.206 --> 31:15.125
Yeah, I think I pushed too hard.

31:15.209 --> 31:16.877
Still feel a bit shaky.

31:18.670 --> 31:23.217
Well, look, we've got that mixer tonight.
Miranda's thing.

31:24.218 --> 31:26.178
But we-- Hey, look,
we can cancel if you want.

31:27.638 --> 31:28.764
I'll be okay.

31:31.183 --> 31:34.853
Why don't we-- I don't know.

31:34.937 --> 31:38.899
Why don't we just stay here and cook?

31:40.901 --> 31:41.902
Just the two of us.

31:44.655 --> 31:48.367
It's a work thing.
We should show our faces, right?

31:49.284 --> 31:51.453
- You're right.
- I should get ready, then.

32:03.423 --> 32:04.883
Thanks for coming.

32:04.967 --> 32:07.803
I know it isn't our usual time,
but something came up.

32:08.387 --> 32:10.180
Attempted homicide I need you
to follow up on.

32:12.307 --> 32:15.727
His wife went overboard on a ferry.
It was ruled an attempted suicide,

32:15.811 --> 32:18.397
but I have reason to believe
the husband lied about his alibi.

32:18.480 --> 32:21.650
It doesn't sound like it has anything
to do with the case you're working on.

32:21.733 --> 32:23.986
So, okay. Yeah, it's not my jurisdiction.

32:24.069 --> 32:26.572
What do you expect me to do,
just look the other way?

32:26.655 --> 32:29.074
It was an attempted homicide.
She's still in danger.

32:30.325 --> 32:34.913
Is this the same woman who showed up
at the station, asking for you?

32:36.999 --> 32:38.292
You got a thing with her?

32:39.793 --> 32:41.545
Jesus, fuck.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.507
Nah. There's nothing here
puts him at the scene.

32:45.591 --> 32:46.717
GPS records.

32:46.800 --> 32:48.552
Oh, yeah. And where'd you get those?

32:49.178 --> 32:50.929
You gonna tell me they're admissible
in court?

32:54.183 --> 32:56.977
All right, listen to me.
I get the job's tough.

32:58.562 --> 33:02.733
I've been there.
I know how welcome distractions can be,

33:02.816 --> 33:05.527
but not the kind that are gonna
blow your fucking cover,

33:05.611 --> 33:06.987
that can get you killed.

33:07.988 --> 33:11.200
All right, forget about this shit.
End it with her.

33:12.367 --> 33:15.871
And if she's in danger, she can call 911.

33:15.954 --> 33:19.374
Get the full protection of the SFPD
at her service.

33:19.458 --> 33:20.584
But not you.

33:21.460 --> 33:22.461
Okay?

33:25.797 --> 33:28.175
Or I'm gonna go to the captain
and have you pulled. Do you understand me?

33:28.258 --> 33:31.011
I got it. I got it.

33:45.567 --> 33:47.110
What is this place?

33:48.862 --> 33:51.573
Lennox House. It's a private club.

33:53.408 --> 33:54.493
You remember it?

33:57.621 --> 33:58.622
No.

34:09.842 --> 34:14.471
Oh, my God. Sophie, you look great.

34:14.554 --> 34:15.931
- Hi.
- Hey.

34:16.806 --> 34:19.351
- Elliot, it's good to see you.
- You too.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.728
Holy shit, Shawn Pareksh is here.

34:21.812 --> 34:23.730
Twelve o'clock, Buddy Holly glasses.
Let's go.

34:25.148 --> 34:27.234
Wha-- Are you serious? We just got here.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.152
Oh, my God.
What the fuck's with you lately?

34:30.237 --> 34:31.280
Gotta go.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.159
Okay, be right back.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.496
Always so much work at these work parties.

34:41.706 --> 34:43.625
I'm just gonna find the ladies' room.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.128
- Grab me a drink?
- Of course.

34:50.799 --> 34:54.386
The way that we operate
as a company is very, very different. Soâ€¦

35:25.292 --> 35:26.502
I can't talk right now.

35:26.585 --> 35:28.587
<i>Where are you? With him?</i>

35:28.670 --> 35:31.131
In public. At a work party.

35:31.215 --> 35:33.634
The Lennox House.
I'll call you back later.

35:41.266 --> 35:43.393
Hey, can I get one more?

35:46.230 --> 35:47.314
Ellis.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.358
Miranda.

35:49.441 --> 35:52.611
Hey, I know
the investigator's picking on you.

35:54.154 --> 35:55.197
Is she?

35:55.280 --> 35:57.199
Think she sees something that isn't there.

35:57.282 --> 35:59.660
But I know this whole thing
has nothing to do with you.

36:02.996 --> 36:05.832
Well, I'm sure
she'll get to the bottom of it. She seemsâ€¦

36:06.792 --> 36:08.001
more than capable.

36:09.002 --> 36:11.213
Have a drink. Relax.

36:15.968 --> 36:17.636
It's shitting everywhere.

36:17.719 --> 36:19.388
Will you just take her back to theâ€¦

36:20.848 --> 36:22.474
Sorry. I got caught up.

36:23.517 --> 36:25.936
I got a good feeling about this deal.

36:26.019 --> 36:27.771
Are you kidding? You nailed it.

36:27.855 --> 36:30.065
I mean, I'm always too aggressive,
but this guy,

36:30.148 --> 36:32.860
he's just got this way
of making everyone trust him.

36:33.527 --> 36:34.862
Right, Sophie?

36:35.863 --> 36:37.030
Absolutely.

36:37.614 --> 36:38.740
I need another drink.

36:39.241 --> 36:40.492
Yeah, I'll take another scotch.

36:40.576 --> 36:42.160
- Jesus, slow down.
- I'm good.

36:42.244 --> 36:43.912
- You sure?
- I'm fine.

36:45.998 --> 36:47.958
I'll get this one. You got the last one.

36:48.959 --> 36:50.377
Get him a water.

36:57.301 --> 36:58.844
- What are you doing here?
- Let's go.

36:58.927 --> 37:00.596
You have proof James was at the pier.

37:00.679 --> 37:02.472
That makes him a threat
right here, right now.

37:02.556 --> 37:05.601
I can't just leave with you.
You don't get it.

37:05.684 --> 37:08.937
Look, I know you just want to pretend
the past didn't happen.

37:09.021 --> 37:12.399
Just be who we are now.
But that past is real.

37:13.108 --> 37:14.109
I'm married.

37:14.776 --> 37:17.654
I had a brain injury, and I got put
under a fucking conservatorship.

37:17.738 --> 37:19.823
I can't just disappear.
We have to do this right.

37:19.907 --> 37:21.158
Staying here is gonna get you killed.

37:21.241 --> 37:23.660
No, you being here
is what's gonna get me killed.

37:23.744 --> 37:24.786
Sophie?

37:31.126 --> 37:32.419
Hey.

37:32.503 --> 37:34.546
I'm James Ellis.
You're with Cyprus, right?

37:35.172 --> 37:38.383
Yeah. Yeah. John Carillo.
Pleasure to meet you.

37:38.467 --> 37:39.760
Nice to meet you.

37:39.843 --> 37:41.428
We're heading downstairs.

37:41.512 --> 37:43.430
You want to grab your drink
and come meet us?

37:43.514 --> 37:44.890
- Yeah. Course.
- Yeah?

37:44.973 --> 37:45.974
You too, John.

37:50.229 --> 37:51.396
Can I get you anything?

37:54.733 --> 37:56.485
A glass of water, please.

38:02.074 --> 38:03.742
He doesn't even know who you are.

38:03.825 --> 38:05.160
Okay, but that doesn't mean that--

38:05.244 --> 38:08.664
So we were wrong about the motive.

38:10.624 --> 38:12.668
- Maybe we were wrong about everything.
- No.

38:13.377 --> 38:15.045
You think you know what's going on.

38:15.128 --> 38:16.672
- You think you know me.
- Sophie, listen--

38:16.755 --> 38:17.840
Maybe you don't.

38:47.286 --> 38:48.912
You look like you're having zero fun.

38:54.835 --> 38:55.919
You okay?

38:58.505 --> 39:02.050
It's been a tricky transition
back to normal life.

39:02.134 --> 39:04.428
- Whatever that is.
- Right?

39:06.054 --> 39:09.266
If I'm being honest,
it's been really difficult lately.

39:10.100 --> 39:13.103
And the investigation at the firm,
I'm sure that's not helping.

39:15.606 --> 39:18.317
No, it isn't.

39:21.195 --> 39:23.447
Is it affecting Harrison as well?

39:24.031 --> 39:26.617
He tends to let things slide off his back.

39:26.700 --> 39:31.705
I don't know how when there are
millions of dollars missing.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.875
Sometimes I think he's a sociopath.

39:36.919 --> 39:40.088
Well, it's great that
he takes things in his stride.

39:41.632 --> 39:43.091
I wish James could do that.

39:43.675 --> 39:44.968
I mean, I get it.

39:45.469 --> 39:48.639
Now that the investigation
is focusing on his department,

39:48.722 --> 39:50.933
I understand if James is stressed.

39:52.935 --> 39:54.019
Right.

39:59.900 --> 40:03.529
To be honest, the financial lingo
goes over my head a little.

40:04.696 --> 40:08.492
How much trouble
could someone be getting in here?

40:09.034 --> 40:15.707
Well, I mean, if it ends up that somebody
actually stole this money from the firm,

40:15.791 --> 40:18.502
which I am sure is not the case,

40:18.585 --> 40:20.504
but if it is?

40:21.338 --> 40:25.217
Embezzlement is serious jail time.
I mean, right?

40:30.764 --> 40:31.932
Yeah.

40:32.641 --> 40:34.142
It could bring the whole company down.

40:37.312 --> 40:39.314
It looks like things are going well
over there.

40:39.398 --> 40:41.859
We're actually gonna join him
for a late dinner. Seal the deal.

40:41.942 --> 40:42.943
Okay.

40:44.027 --> 40:45.737
I'll send the car to pick you up, okay?

40:45.821 --> 40:46.989
I'll be fine.

41:07.634 --> 41:08.927
Right, James?

41:09.011 --> 41:10.053
Yeah.

41:11.221 --> 41:13.515
I'm gonna--
Wait, I'm gonna grab another drink.

41:13.599 --> 41:15.350
- You sure, buddy?
- Yeah.

41:16.143 --> 41:19.354
- Okay. Just take it easy.
- I'm good.

41:25.485 --> 41:27.446
I'm just gonna go check on him.

41:27.529 --> 41:29.948
Stacey, make sure Shawn has a good time.

41:30.032 --> 41:31.033
Sure.

41:38.874 --> 41:40.792
Dude, you okay?

41:40.876 --> 41:41.919
Shit.

41:43.462 --> 41:45.964
You gonna be sick? That's not a good look.

41:49.343 --> 41:51.720
Hey. Bro, what--

41:51.803 --> 41:54.097
What the fuck's going on, man?
Are you all right?

41:56.183 --> 41:57.601
No.

41:58.810 --> 42:02.064
- Is it Sophie?
- Fuck.

42:02.689 --> 42:03.690
What?

42:04.608 --> 42:05.734
I fucked up, man.

42:07.194 --> 42:08.904
I fuck-- I fucked up.

42:08.987 --> 42:12.157
And I don't know how to come out
the other side on this one. And--

42:12.241 --> 42:13.408
What happened?

42:13.492 --> 42:15.577
I can't, I can'tâ€¦

42:16.119 --> 42:17.162
I can't say.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.500
Is this about the investigation?

42:26.129 --> 42:27.130
No.

42:28.841 --> 42:30.133
I'm fine now.

42:30.217 --> 42:31.885
- So let's go talk to Shawn.
- Hey, no, no.

42:31.969 --> 42:33.804
I've known you too long.
Don't do that shit.

42:33.887 --> 42:36.181
- I meant-- Let me just--
- Dude, just look-- No, dude--

42:36.265 --> 42:38.183
Hey, hey, look at me. Look at me.

42:40.853 --> 42:43.063
Whatever it is, I got you, okay?

42:44.731 --> 42:45.732
You're my brother.

42:46.358 --> 42:49.278
But you just gotta tell me
what the fuck is going on.

42:52.489 --> 42:57.035
Okay. I took some unnecessary risks.

42:57.119 --> 42:58.453
- And it--
- Fuck.

42:58.537 --> 43:02.291
No, there was an opportunity,
and I trusted the wrong person.

43:02.374 --> 43:04.251
Okay? And I got fucked.

43:04.334 --> 43:07.462
But I thought I could
make it right before anyone found out.

43:07.546 --> 43:11.341
Look, it was an honest mistake.

43:11.425 --> 43:14.928
You know me, I would--
I wouldn't steal money from the firm.

43:17.306 --> 43:18.348
You kn--

43:19.558 --> 43:23.312
You believe me, right? I wouldn't do that.

43:23.395 --> 43:26.106
I wouldn't--

43:27.482 --> 43:28.859
Fuck.

43:29.776 --> 43:32.738
Okay, just come here. Come here.

43:49.796 --> 43:53.467
You shouldn't have shown up like that.
It's not safe to talk just anywhere.

43:53.550 --> 43:55.511
Sophie, what the hell is going on?

43:57.638 --> 44:00.307
There's an investigation going on
at James's firm.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.309
Millions of dollars missing.

44:02.392 --> 44:03.727
So, you think it's on him?

44:04.311 --> 44:07.481
He's been drinking too much,
staying late at work.

44:07.564 --> 44:10.067
He has cameras everywhere.
He's paranoid about something.

44:10.150 --> 44:11.235
What if it's this?

44:11.318 --> 44:13.153
So he steals a couple million,
you find out--

44:13.237 --> 44:16.240
And he had to get rid of the one person
who knew what he did.

44:23.830 --> 44:25.374
Do you think this is possible?

44:26.917 --> 44:29.294
That he could really try
to kill me for this?

44:29.378 --> 44:32.297
Look, I've seen people
do a lot worse for a lot less.

44:38.387 --> 44:43.475
You know, my whole life
made sense until you walked into it.

44:45.227 --> 44:46.270
Did it?

44:47.729 --> 44:50.691
Did you just believe
the story people have been selling you?

44:52.192 --> 44:53.318
That you just jumped?

44:57.364 --> 44:58.365
No.

44:58.448 --> 45:00.367
Who do you believe, Sophie? Me or him?
