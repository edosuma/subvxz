00:00.160 --> 00:04.080
'The following programme contains
strong language from the outset.'

00:10.000 --> 00:12.960
'All I can think about
is Neve!'

00:13.000 --> 00:15.360
'Whatever's happened,
don't push them away.'

00:15.400 --> 00:16.000
You're drunk, Tom.
Get the fuck...!

00:16.000 --> 00:18.400
You're drunk, Tom.
Get the fuck...!

00:24.160 --> 00:26.440
I want you to tell me about Neve.

00:28.440 --> 00:31.520
Has anything bad
ever happened at Keaton Hall?

00:35.240 --> 00:38.440
You can see me. Get off!
Stop struggling!

00:49.640 --> 00:52.240
there's no better days

00:56.040 --> 00:58.720
until I'm scared of day

02:55.840 --> 02:56.000
Oh, for fuck's sake!

02:56.000 --> 02:58.120
Oh, for fuck's sake!

03:00.440 --> 03:02.840
I thought you were a burglar.

03:04.280 --> 03:05.760
What are you doing?

03:05.800 --> 03:07.920
If I find the belt,
it might trigger something.

03:07.960 --> 03:09.880
I might remember more
about what happened.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.000
What belt?

03:12.000 --> 03:12.120
What belt?

03:12.160 --> 03:13.880
Shit.

03:13.920 --> 03:16.160
He wouldn't just leave it
in a drawer.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.480
We have to get out of here.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.000
It's not safe for you either.

03:20.000 --> 03:21.480
It's not safe for you either.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.600
What are you talking about?

03:23.640 --> 03:26.360
Neve? What happened at the hotel?

03:29.440 --> 03:31.600
That's where I died.
Are you sure?

03:33.680 --> 03:35.840
I felt him strangling me...

03:37.120 --> 03:39.160
..then he was there.
Who?

03:44.680 --> 03:46.160
No.
I'm so sorry.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.880
You're wrong.

03:47.920 --> 03:49.520
I wish I was.

03:51.840 --> 03:52.000
We can't talk here. If he finds -
My dad...

03:52.000 --> 03:54.120
We can't talk here. If he finds -
My dad...

03:57.520 --> 04:00.000
You're telling me that my dad...
He killed me.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.560
You're telling me that my dad...
He killed me.

04:03.680 --> 04:05.080
No way.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.800
Please. We have to go.

04:09.280 --> 04:11.040
No, stop! Stop!

04:13.360 --> 04:16.000
Why do you think it was him?
I could see it in his face.

04:16.000 --> 04:16.240
Why do you think it was him?
I could see it in his face.

04:16.280 --> 04:18.840
He tried to stop me but I got away.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.440
Wait. He can't even see you.
He can now.

04:21.480 --> 04:23.960
I don't know what's going on.
Maybe he's always seen me.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.200
But he would have
said something or reacted -

04:26.240 --> 04:28.600
Help me open the door.
This doesn't make any sense.

04:28.640 --> 04:30.280
Let me out!

04:34.280 --> 04:37.240
Whatever's in those woods,
it's messing with your head

04:37.280 --> 04:39.400
and showing you things
that aren't real.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.000
Dad's not violent!
He killed me!

04:40.000 --> 04:41.600
Dad's not violent!
He killed me!

04:41.640 --> 04:44.120
I remember what it felt like,
his belt around my neck.

04:44.160 --> 04:46.480
It was thick leather.
But do you remember HIM?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.000
No, because he fucking drugged me!

04:48.000 --> 04:48.800
No, because he fucking drugged me!

04:48.840 --> 04:50.840
You can't keep doing this, Neve.

04:50.880 --> 04:54.440
Picking someone and deciding
they're guilty based on a feeling.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.000
A few days ago,
you were sure it was Joe!

04:56.000 --> 04:56.720
A few days ago,
you were sure it was Joe!

04:57.640 --> 04:59.520
This is different.
Joe didn't do it

04:59.560 --> 05:02.480
and neither did Dad.
He attacked me. The room went crazy.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.000
We fought and he tried
to stop me from leaving.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.680
We fought and he tried
to stop me from leaving.

05:04.720 --> 05:07.480
Neve, calm down.
I need you to go to the police.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.080
And say what?

05:20.760 --> 05:22.400
After you.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Sorry I'm late.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Sorry I'm late.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.960
I've been busy, anyway.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.840
Is everything OK?

05:34.800 --> 05:36.000
What's happened?

05:36.000 --> 05:36.880
What's happened?

05:41.320 --> 05:43.560
Dad?

05:44.280 --> 05:45.640
Dad!

05:52.960 --> 05:54.640
Fuck.

05:56.720 --> 05:59.320
So...where is she now?

05:59.360 --> 06:00.000
Don't know. Could be anywhere.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.880
Don't know. Could be anywhere.

06:01.920 --> 06:03.920
She... She comes and goes.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.040
Same as ever.

06:08.040 --> 06:13.120
But...if she walked in here
right now, you'd see her?

06:17.640 --> 06:19.320
What does she look like?

06:21.680 --> 06:23.320
Same.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.040
So, not...

06:27.000 --> 06:28.520
What?

06:28.560 --> 06:30.440
I dunno, like a ghost or...

06:30.480 --> 06:32.000
Oh, she's...she's as solid
as you and me.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.480
Oh, she's...she's as solid
as you and me.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.720
She's not a ghost.
Then what is she?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.800
I don't understand it either.

06:40.600 --> 06:42.320
It's like she's...

06:43.680 --> 06:46.240
..she's not gone...

06:46.280 --> 06:48.000
but...she's not alive.

06:48.000 --> 06:48.280
but...she's not alive.

06:48.320 --> 06:53.240
She's...somewhere in between
and wherever that is...

06:55.120 --> 06:56.000
..I can see her.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.160
..I can see her.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.240
What makes YOU so special?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.200
Wish I knew.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.200
I've so wanted
to share this with you.

07:15.280 --> 07:17.080
I worry about her.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.000
She's seen things that nobody
should have to deal with.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.920
She's seen things that nobody
should have to deal with.

07:23.480 --> 07:27.560
Like, she was there at the lake
when...when we found her.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.880
She was in the room
when they did the post-mortem.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.720
Jesus Christ.

07:39.680 --> 07:41.480
Can she remember what happened?

07:41.520 --> 07:44.000
No. She... She thinks
it's because she was drugged, but...

07:44.000 --> 07:45.240
No. She... She thinks
it's because she was drugged, but...

07:48.560 --> 07:51.080
..I think there's
something else going on.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.160
What does she do when she's here?

07:56.200 --> 07:59.560
She's trying to understand, like us.

08:02.880 --> 08:05.200
You do know how insane
this all sounds?

08:06.520 --> 08:08.000
Yeah.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.160
I'm a regular nutcase.

08:15.880 --> 08:16.000
Welcome to the club.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.880
Welcome to the club.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.680
Maria didn't come home?

08:29.720 --> 08:31.640
No, she texted.

08:31.680 --> 08:32.000
She's staying
somewhere else tonight.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.840
She's staying
somewhere else tonight.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.480
Cooling off.

08:36.280 --> 08:38.240
OK.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.000
Cos of me.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.480
Cos of me.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.160
Uh, made the mistake
of checking my emails.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
First time in days.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.000
I'll let you get back to it.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.760
I'll let you get back to it.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.000
OK.

09:15.760 --> 09:17.760
I'm scared.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.040
Don't know where else to go.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.400
I'm glad you're up.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.000
Night.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.320
Night.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.600
I was about to come looking for you.

11:00.640 --> 11:03.480
Your mum and I have been talking.
It's William Wyatt.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.120
What?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.080
William Wyatt killed me,
with his belt.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.640
I swear it's true.

11:10.680 --> 11:12.000
He found me at the hotel last night.
He attacked me.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.400
He found me at the hotel last night.
He attacked me.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.240
William?

11:17.280 --> 11:18.680
Why?

11:19.680 --> 11:20.000
I knew he didn't like me.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.840
I knew he didn't like me.

11:21.880 --> 11:24.560
Joe always said it
was cos I stood up to him, but...

11:24.600 --> 11:27.280
I think he knew how good I was,
and he hated it.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.000
He can't have done this
for fucking motocross.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.320
He can't have done this
for fucking motocross.

11:29.360 --> 11:32.560
Joe and those races are all
he cares about. He's obsessed.

11:32.600 --> 11:34.640
All right.
Well, we need to go to the police.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.000
We haven't got proof.
You'll just look crazy.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.840
We haven't got proof.
You'll just look crazy.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.600
What, then?

11:39.640 --> 11:42.120
Joe and Michael
might know something.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.000
Neve, I'm not a cop.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.360
Neve, I'm not a cop.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.760
Get your keys.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.920
Come on, come on.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.000
Hey.
Hi.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.360
Hey.
Hi.

12:22.360 --> 12:24.000
I just needed some clothes.
Maria...

12:24.000 --> 12:25.080
I just needed some clothes.
Maria...

12:25.880 --> 12:27.600
Where did you stay?

12:28.520 --> 12:31.080
Tom's.
You're fucking kidding me.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.000
In the spare room.
We were just talking.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.200
In the spare room.
We were just talking.

12:33.240 --> 12:35.520
Well, why HIS spare room?
I dunno.

12:36.240 --> 12:39.480
Just...he's the only one
who knows how it feels.

12:41.280 --> 12:44.120
Look, there's nothing going on.
I just need a few days to -

12:44.160 --> 12:46.400
Neve was mine, too.

12:47.920 --> 12:48.000
Maybe not by blood, but I was
the one picking her up from school,

12:48.000 --> 12:50.800
Maybe not by blood, but I was
the one picking her up from school,

12:50.840 --> 12:54.240
going to parents' evenings, patching
her up when she fell off her bike.

12:54.280 --> 12:56.000
How dare you say
I don't know how it feels?

12:56.000 --> 12:56.200
How dare you say
I don't know how it feels?

12:56.240 --> 12:58.440
I didn't mean that you -
And where was he?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.640
In the fucking pub.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.000
Daniel...
I have tried so hard to support you.

13:04.000 --> 13:04.560
Daniel...
I have tried so hard to support you.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.960
I have done everything you asked.

13:08.000 --> 13:12.000
I am sick of you acting like I am
some sort of bystander in all this.

13:12.000 --> 13:12.200
I am sick of you acting like I am
some sort of bystander in all this.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.360
Like I didn't love her.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.960
Like I don't miss her every day.

13:27.960 --> 13:28.000
I need you to be straight with me,
cos I've been here before.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.440
I need you to be straight with me,
cos I've been here before.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.000
If you're not coming back to us,
I need to know.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.400
If you're not coming back to us,
I need to know.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.400
I can't see the kids
go through that again.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.320
I know.

13:55.560 --> 13:58.280
How are they?

13:59.800 --> 14:00.000
You don't get it both ways.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.120
You don't get it both ways.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.920
Just sort this out.

14:07.360 --> 14:08.000
Come home.

14:08.000 --> 14:09.280
Come home.

14:25.680 --> 14:27.560
What's that?

14:27.600 --> 14:30.040
Nothing you need to worry about.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.760
Morning.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.720
Alex, can you sit down, please?

14:39.760 --> 14:40.000
Why?
We just want to chat.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.320
Why?
We just want to chat.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.200
Your dad told me about last night.

14:55.640 --> 14:56.000
What about it?
You were drinking...

14:56.000 --> 14:57.640
What about it?
You were drinking...

14:57.680 --> 14:59.800
acting erratically,
not being yourself.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.000
Look, we think it would be good
if you saw someone...

15:04.000 --> 15:04.520
Look, we think it would be good
if you saw someone...

15:05.320 --> 15:08.040
..a professional.
I don't need an intervention.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.000
Just someone to speak to.

15:12.000 --> 15:12.760
Just someone to speak to.

15:12.800 --> 15:15.200
I had a few drinks at the club.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.880
So what? I'm not 12.

15:17.920 --> 15:19.960
It's not just the drinking.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.040
I don't even know
where this is coming from.

15:22.080 --> 15:25.000
I barely saw you last night.

15:25.040 --> 15:28.000
You left right after
I spoke to you about the hotel.

15:28.000 --> 15:28.160
You left right after
I spoke to you about the hotel.

15:36.160 --> 15:40.040
You're never home.
What are you doing all day?

15:40.720 --> 15:42.440
Nothing. Just walking.

15:42.480 --> 15:44.000
I've spent enough time
staring at walls.

15:44.000 --> 15:44.320
I've spent enough time
staring at walls.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.280
Where?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.400
The woods, mostly.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.280
Why does it matter?

15:53.280 --> 15:56.760
We've seen you talking to yourself.
It's not normal.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.840
Everyone does that sometimes.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.000
Not full-blown conversations.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.320
Not full-blown conversations.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.000
Whatever's going on here...

16:08.000 --> 16:08.240
Whatever's going on here...

16:09.400 --> 16:11.640
..I don't need professional help.

16:27.680 --> 16:30.840
We can't make her see someone
if she doesn't want to.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.000
Maybe being here is the problem.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.040
Maybe being here is the problem.

16:33.080 --> 16:36.160
You should speak to your sister,
see if she'll take her for a bit.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.760
Send her away?
We only just got her back.

16:38.800 --> 16:40.000
Look, I don't like it either,

16:40.000 --> 16:40.560
Look, I don't like it either,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.880
but we can't let this
get out of control.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.480
What are you doing?

17:15.080 --> 17:17.920
Looking for a screwdriver.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.000
A hinge on the rabbit hutch
is loose.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.120
A hinge on the rabbit hutch
is loose.

17:22.360 --> 17:25.400
The screwdrivers are right there.

17:29.240 --> 17:32.200
Oh... Yeah.

17:35.800 --> 17:36.000
What did you do to your hand?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.800
What did you do to your hand?

17:38.480 --> 17:41.040
I scratched myself.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.720
It's nothing.

17:44.960 --> 17:49.080
Where'd you go last night...
after the club?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.000
I went to pick up your mum.

17:52.000 --> 17:52.720
I went to pick up your mum.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.080
You got any other questions?

18:00.520 --> 18:02.320
I'll sort it for you.

18:05.280 --> 18:08.000
I guess you think I'm too unstable
to handle sharp objects.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.040
I guess you think I'm too unstable
to handle sharp objects.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.000
All right, Tom?

18:32.000 --> 18:32.680
All right, Tom?

18:32.720 --> 18:35.400
The noise from the renovation
got a bit much.

18:35.440 --> 18:39.520
One perk of living in a caravan -
new view whenever you feel like it.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.400
Everything OK?

18:42.440 --> 18:44.200
Yeah, yeah. Just, um...

18:45.120 --> 18:48.000
Yeah, just...just wanted
to say thanks for yesterday.

18:48.000 --> 18:48.160
Yeah, just...just wanted
to say thanks for yesterday.

18:49.040 --> 18:51.920
I've not had a drink since, so...

18:51.960 --> 18:53.520
That's great.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.000
Bet you feel a bit rough, though.
Yeah.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.000
Bet you feel a bit rough, though.
Yeah.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.040
Uh, William's not about, is he?
No.

19:03.080 --> 19:04.000
Why? Do you need him for something?

19:04.000 --> 19:05.640
Why? Do you need him for something?

19:05.680 --> 19:07.400
No, just, uh...

19:07.440 --> 19:11.040
just want to talk about him...
between us.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.160
Start with Joe.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.240
Hey, Joe...

19:23.000 --> 19:28.000
Um... He wasn't at the party,
the other night Neve, um...?

19:28.000 --> 19:28.840
Um... He wasn't at the party,
the other night Neve, um...?

19:30.040 --> 19:31.200
No.

19:32.480 --> 19:34.720
And did YOU see him that night?

19:34.760 --> 19:36.000
I was in Hayeswood.

19:36.000 --> 19:36.360
I was in Hayeswood.

19:36.400 --> 19:40.320
Had a meeting about the Hall.
Didn't get back till morning. Why?

19:41.400 --> 19:42.960
Uh...

19:44.040 --> 19:47.120
You're just trying to remember.
I'm just trying to remember.

19:47.160 --> 19:49.880
My memory's not...great.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.120
Um...

19:54.160 --> 19:56.680
So where was he, then, that night?

19:59.080 --> 20:00.000
At home, I guess.
Tom, what are you trying to say?

20:00.000 --> 20:02.840
At home, I guess.
Tom, what are you trying to say?

20:04.320 --> 20:07.680
Um...
I reckon you should go home, mate.

20:08.520 --> 20:11.480
It's the best place to be
when you're withdrawing.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.440
Yeah.
Get some rest.

20:19.280 --> 20:21.560
What the fuck's he playing at?

20:21.600 --> 20:24.000
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've got a splitting headache.

20:24.000 --> 20:24.080
Oh, I'm sorry.
I've got a splitting headache.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.680
I can't think straight.

20:26.720 --> 20:29.360
You stopped drinking?
Yeah.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.360
Go home and sleep it off.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.600
I believe you.

21:08.960 --> 21:12.000
My whole life,
all I ever wanted was his approval.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.960
My whole life,
all I ever wanted was his approval.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.480
And now it's like...

21:17.280 --> 21:19.720
..I can't bear to look at him.

21:22.600 --> 21:24.480
I'm sorry.

21:26.680 --> 21:28.000
I want to help finish this.

21:28.000 --> 21:28.720
I want to help finish this.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.280
Neve!

21:37.720 --> 21:39.960
You don't need to hide!

21:44.760 --> 21:46.760
I just want to talk!

21:57.680 --> 22:00.000
All right, Joe?
Have you spoken to Tom today?

22:00.040 --> 22:01.760
No. Why?

22:09.960 --> 22:13.440
You all right? Some bastard
stole the tools out of my van.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.760
If you hear anything...
Yeah, no problem, sir.

22:15.800 --> 22:16.000
I will fill out a report.
All right.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.720
I will fill out a report.
All right.

22:25.240 --> 22:26.560
Hello, Tom.

22:27.440 --> 22:29.680
Hi.
You wanted to see me?

22:30.760 --> 22:32.000
Um...yeah.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.240
Um...yeah.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.520
The thing is...

22:39.840 --> 22:40.000
I remembered something
about the night of the party.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.440
I remembered something
about the night of the party.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.960
Do you want to come through?
No, no. I'll be quick.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.200
It's William Wyatt.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.400
Sorry?

22:49.440 --> 22:51.760
That's who you need to look at.

22:51.800 --> 22:54.680
William had an alibi for that night.
He was at home.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.000
No, he wasn't.

22:56.000 --> 22:56.520
No, he wasn't.

22:56.560 --> 23:02.040
He couldn't have been because...
he was there with Neve.

23:02.080 --> 23:04.000
You saw them together?
Yeah.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.320
You saw them together?
Yeah.

23:04.360 --> 23:06.080
Well, where? What time?

23:06.120 --> 23:09.880
Um... Uh, just before midnight.
By the fire.

23:11.840 --> 23:12.000
That's all I remember. I just...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.880
That's all I remember. I just...

23:14.920 --> 23:17.240
He was definitely with Neve.
Definitely.

23:18.920 --> 23:20.000
Tom, are you feeling OK?

23:20.000 --> 23:20.880
Tom, are you feeling OK?

23:20.920 --> 23:23.080
Just check out that alibi.

23:26.200 --> 23:28.000
..a brief description
of what it is.

23:28.000 --> 23:28.800
..a brief description
of what it is.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.520
Don't worry about that bit.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.560
So, what sort of questions
was he asking?

23:32.600 --> 23:35.520
Uh, just stuff about Neve.

23:35.560 --> 23:36.000
He wasn't making much sense, though.
I think the poor bloke's losing it.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.880
He wasn't making much sense, though.
I think the poor bloke's losing it.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.720
I found him passed out
on a park bench the other night.

23:42.760 --> 23:44.000
He was saying he still sees her.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.760
He was saying he still sees her.

23:45.800 --> 23:47.040
Neve.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.080
Reckons she speaks to him.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.000
Jesus.

23:52.000 --> 23:52.520
Jesus.

23:53.640 --> 23:56.360
I think it's the guilt, you know?

23:57.400 --> 24:00.000
He'd be the first to say
he wasn't much of a dad.

24:00.000 --> 24:00.480
He'd be the first to say
he wasn't much of a dad.

24:01.200 --> 24:03.360
God knows what else he's capable of.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.840
Just, like, stay clear of him,
all right?

24:06.880 --> 24:08.000
Good lad.

24:08.000 --> 24:08.840
Good lad.

24:23.000 --> 24:24.000
Sit down for a sec.

24:24.000 --> 24:24.760
Sit down for a sec.

24:24.800 --> 24:28.200
I was gonna go and do some work -
Just sit, please.

24:40.840 --> 24:43.160
So what's Alex said now?

24:43.920 --> 24:48.000
I want to talk about that night,
after the championship.

24:48.000 --> 24:48.920
I want to talk about that night,
after the championship.

24:50.360 --> 24:52.400
You mean when Neve was...

24:54.960 --> 24:56.000
And what about it?

24:56.000 --> 24:56.760
And what about it?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.800
What do you remember?

25:01.000 --> 25:04.000
Uh, we had dinner...

25:04.000 --> 25:04.040
Uh, we had dinner...

25:04.080 --> 25:06.840
watched a crap film
and uh...went to bed.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.800
And then what?

25:08.840 --> 25:11.400
Then morning came
and all hell broke loose.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.800
You see, the thing is -

25:16.840 --> 25:19.480
I really don't think
we should be raking this up.

25:20.520 --> 25:25.760
It was a...shit day and I would
rather just forget about it.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.000
And it's, like...
it's not good for you...

25:28.000 --> 25:29.680
And it's, like...
it's not good for you...

25:31.560 --> 25:36.000
..living with this case...24/7.

25:36.000 --> 25:36.600
..living with this case...24/7.

25:36.640 --> 25:38.920
You know, bringing it home.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.520
It's not good for us.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.000
No.

25:44.000 --> 25:44.440
No.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.840
I worry about you.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.000
No.

25:52.000 --> 25:52.360
No.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.040
Sorry, what?

25:54.080 --> 25:55.760
We're not doing this here.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.480
Oh, yes, we are.

25:58.200 --> 26:00.000
I want to hear it all.
Alex?

26:00.000 --> 26:00.320
I want to hear it all.
Alex?

26:00.360 --> 26:02.000
I want Alex to hear it.

26:02.880 --> 26:05.560
Every detail.
Explain it to me, Dad.

26:05.600 --> 26:08.000
What the hell
is going on with you two?

26:08.000 --> 26:08.240
What the hell
is going on with you two?

26:12.800 --> 26:15.040
Alex!

26:21.480 --> 26:23.280
I know you can see her.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.000
I thought you needed therapy
but maybe you need sectioning.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.040
I thought you needed therapy
but maybe you need sectioning.

26:26.080 --> 26:27.440
He's scared.

26:27.480 --> 26:30.040
William Wyatt, the big man
around town is fucking terrified.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.000
I want the truth.
Tell me what happened that night.

26:32.000 --> 26:32.760
I want the truth.
Tell me what happened that night.

26:32.800 --> 26:34.400
Dad!

26:34.440 --> 26:37.360
I am not gonna tolerate
this bullshit, Alex.

26:37.400 --> 26:39.000
You've put your mother
through enough.

26:39.040 --> 26:40.000
You're a murderer.

26:40.000 --> 26:40.640
You're a murderer.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.800
I'll never let you forget that.

26:43.560 --> 26:46.200
You can't kill me twice.
Just shut up!

26:48.760 --> 26:50.400
Tell me the truth, Dad!
Get off the key.

26:50.440 --> 26:52.680
Tell me what happened!
Get off the key!
Just tell her!

26:52.720 --> 26:56.000
Just get away from me!
Just get the fuck away from me!

26:56.000 --> 26:56.160
Just get away from me!
Just get the fuck away from me!

26:56.200 --> 27:00.120
William!
You need to calm down right now!

27:00.160 --> 27:02.120
I won't have it.

27:04.400 --> 27:06.000
Thanks.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.520
I just needed them to see that.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.000
I think he had something to do
with what happened with Neve.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.320
I think he had something to do
with what happened with Neve.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.240
He's lied before, Mum.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.000
And he made me lie to you...
and the police.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.160
And he made me lie to you...
and the police.

27:54.400 --> 27:55.880
About Neve?

27:58.240 --> 28:00.000
You don't have to do this.

28:00.000 --> 28:00.400
You don't have to do this.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.400
About the accident.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.800
It wasn't just my fault.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.000
What are you talking about?

28:16.000 --> 28:17.560
What are you talking about?

28:17.600 --> 28:19.520
Joe was messing about...

28:20.400 --> 28:22.400
..telling me to go faster,

28:22.440 --> 28:24.000
and he covered my eyes.

28:24.000 --> 28:24.440
and he covered my eyes.

28:26.200 --> 28:27.840
I couldn't see.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.000
That's why I lost control.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.760
That's why I lost control.

28:34.920 --> 28:38.000
He said there was no point
both of us getting in trouble,

28:38.040 --> 28:40.000
that Joe had too much potential
to throw it away.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.080
that Joe had too much potential
to throw it away.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.440
Why didn't you tell me?

28:48.160 --> 28:50.920
Cos he always taught me
to keep my head down,

28:50.960 --> 28:54.480
to do whatever I could to fit in.

28:59.040 --> 29:04.000
And that when I didn't...
I'd cause trouble...

29:04.000 --> 29:04.080
And that when I didn't...
I'd cause trouble...

29:04.920 --> 29:06.920
..for him...

29:07.880 --> 29:09.960
..for us.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.000
You should never
have to feel that way.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.040
You should never
have to feel that way.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.840
But I did.

29:21.720 --> 29:24.440
You can't trust him, Mum.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.600
He's hiding something.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.000
Mum?

29:36.000 --> 29:36.280
Mum?

29:39.440 --> 29:41.200
Mum, what do you know?

29:45.960 --> 29:49.600
That night...when Neve was killed...

29:52.600 --> 29:54.480
..I woke up...

29:54.520 --> 29:57.120
and your dad wasn't next to me.

30:15.120 --> 30:16.000
You know, don't you?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.480
You know, don't you?

30:19.400 --> 30:22.040
In your gut, you know.

30:27.360 --> 30:28.760
Oh, hi.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.960
Everything all right?

30:32.000 --> 30:35.840
Yeah, I just wanted to talk to you
about something. In private.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.640
I want her to stay.

30:38.680 --> 30:40.000
I've had a witness come forward.

30:40.000 --> 30:40.880
I've had a witness come forward.

30:40.920 --> 30:43.920
Um, I just wanted to chat to you
about their story.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.560
What story?

30:47.000 --> 30:48.000
Tom Rees has claimed
he saw William...

30:48.000 --> 30:49.960
Tom Rees has claimed
he saw William...

30:50.000 --> 30:52.960
at the party
the night Neve Kelly was murdered.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Um, William said
he was here all night so...

30:56.000 --> 30:56.080
Um, William said
he was here all night so...

30:56.120 --> 30:59.120
I mean, I know Tom's unreliable
at the best of times...

31:00.040 --> 31:03.280
..but, um, I thought
I should check it out, anyway.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.000
Tick the box, you know.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.320
Tick the box, you know.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.920
There's something
I need to tell you.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.000
Is she here?

32:16.000 --> 32:16.240
Is she here?

32:17.360 --> 32:18.880
No.

32:19.880 --> 32:22.680
I swear to God, Tom,
if you're just stringing me along...

32:22.720 --> 32:24.000
I'm not.

32:24.000 --> 32:24.520
I'm not.

32:34.560 --> 32:36.600
What's happened?

32:39.600 --> 32:40.000
William Wyatt killed Neve.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.360
William Wyatt killed Neve.

32:45.360 --> 32:47.400
What?

32:47.440 --> 32:48.000
The police are looking into it -
whatever that means.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.720
The police are looking into it -
whatever that means.

32:53.040 --> 32:55.480
I want to go round there
and kill him myself.

32:55.520 --> 32:56.000
Is this your way of keeping me here?
No, no, no. I swear I-I'm not.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.520
Is this your way of keeping me here?
No, no, no. I swear I-I'm not.

33:02.440 --> 33:04.000
We know you weren't at home
with Christine.

33:04.000 --> 33:04.520
We know you weren't at home
with Christine.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.840
She's confirmed to us
she woke at around00am

33:06.880 --> 33:08.400
and you weren't in the house.

33:08.440 --> 33:11.440
I was in the bathroom.
She doesn't think so.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.000
And we have an eyewitness who says

33:12.000 --> 33:13.560
And we have an eyewitness who says

33:13.600 --> 33:16.520
they saw you at the rave that night
with Neve Kelly.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.640
Diana, this is bloody ridiculous.

33:19.680 --> 33:20.000
Were you with Neve that night?
Nope.

33:20.000 --> 33:21.720
Were you with Neve that night?
Nope.

33:21.760 --> 33:24.720
So, where were you
when your wife woke up?

33:24.760 --> 33:28.000
This makes you look stupid.
Did you know that?

33:28.000 --> 33:28.160
This makes you look stupid.
Did you know that?

33:28.200 --> 33:30.480
I have to take every lead seriously.

33:30.520 --> 33:31.800
This isn't a lead.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.040
This is someone taking a piss
in the middle of the night.

33:35.080 --> 33:36.000
You're embarrassing yourself...
and you're embarrassing Christine.

33:36.000 --> 33:40.360
You're embarrassing yourself...
and you're embarrassing Christine.

33:40.400 --> 33:42.400
I thought you were
supposed to be a friend.

33:42.440 --> 33:43.960
I am.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.880
And, as her friend, I've never
understood what she saw in you...

33:49.600 --> 33:52.000
..cos I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

33:52.000 --> 33:52.680
..cos I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

34:00.000 --> 34:03.040
Are you sure it was Tom Rees?
100%.

34:03.080 --> 34:05.600
He was whispering to that cop.
I saw them.

34:05.640 --> 34:08.000
This is bullshit.
I'd better get down to the station.

34:08.000 --> 34:08.320
This is bullshit.
I'd better get down to the station.

34:08.360 --> 34:11.160
I'll come with you.
No, mate. I'll handle it.

34:14.280 --> 34:16.000
Tom turned up earlier, talking shit,

34:16.000 --> 34:16.160
Tom turned up earlier, talking shit,

34:16.200 --> 34:18.520
asking where Uncle William was
the night it happened.

34:18.560 --> 34:20.760
He wasn't even there
that night, was he?

34:20.800 --> 34:22.560
I didn't see him.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.000
He reckons Tom's losing it

34:24.000 --> 34:24.040
He reckons Tom's losing it

34:24.080 --> 34:26.400
because he feels guilty
about being a shit dad.

34:26.440 --> 34:29.280
What if that's not
what he's feeling guilty about?

34:30.000 --> 34:32.000
What if he killed Neve?
Don't be fucking stupid.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.480
What if he killed Neve?
Don't be fucking stupid.

34:33.520 --> 34:36.440
Asking weird questions,
trying to point the finger...

34:36.480 --> 34:38.680
running off to the cops
to tell tales.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.000
Sounds pretty fucking suspicious
to me.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.000
Sounds pretty fucking suspicious
to me.

34:41.040 --> 34:43.520
I say we find Tom Rees
and get some answers.

34:43.560 --> 34:46.000
Burns. Come on, mate. I dunno.

34:46.040 --> 34:48.000
Remember what he said to us?
About loyalty and trust?

34:48.000 --> 34:49.880
Remember what he said to us?
About loyalty and trust?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.800
About having each other's backs?

34:51.840 --> 34:53.720
That's what he needs from us
right now.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.000
That's what he needs from you.

34:56.040 --> 34:58.880
Yeah, and what if we just
make things worse?

34:58.920 --> 35:01.200
Don't be a pussy. Let's go.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.000
Hey, hey, hey.
We should stay out of this.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.400
Hey, hey, hey.
We should stay out of this.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.280
I know what it's like
to be dragged in by the cops.

35:09.320 --> 35:11.400
Someone's gotta do something.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.520
No.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.000
No-one's telling me anything,
Daniel.

35:20.000 --> 35:20.480
No-one's telling me anything,
Daniel.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.000
It does sound like
he's being questioned.

35:28.280 --> 35:30.680
Right,
so you haven't heard anything?

35:52.200 --> 35:54.160
What's going on, lads?

35:54.200 --> 35:57.600
You tell us. You shopped
William to the cops, didn't you?

35:57.640 --> 36:00.000
You need to ask HIM about that.
We're asking you cos you're
stitching up our mate.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.800
You need to ask HIM about that.
We're asking you cos you're
stitching up our mate.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.240
Now why would that be?
Joe, tell these idiots to piss off.

36:05.280 --> 36:07.320
Why were you
asking questions before?

36:07.360 --> 36:08.000
You know Uncle Will
wasn't at the party.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.360
You know Uncle Will
wasn't at the party.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.000
Yes, he was. He killed Neve.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.240
No, he didn't.
You did, you sick fuck.

36:15.280 --> 36:16.000
I'm sorry, that's the truth.
He had no reason to kill her.

36:16.000 --> 36:17.840
I'm sorry, that's the truth.
He had no reason to kill her.

36:17.880 --> 36:21.440
But he did. I dunno, all he cares
about is that bloody club. And you.

36:21.480 --> 36:23.560
Maybe Neve was a threat
to the championship

36:23.600 --> 36:24.000
All right, so it's MY fault?!
Calm down.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.400
All right, so it's MY fault?!
Calm down.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.480
That's not what I'm saying.
Yeah, you are.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.120
Don't do this. Go home, you idiot!
You're a fucking liar!

36:30.160 --> 36:32.000
Tell it to the police!

36:32.000 --> 36:32.440
Tell it to the police!

36:34.800 --> 36:36.440
Get off me!
Joe, no! No. No.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.040
Get off him!
Come on.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.000
Get the fuck off him!

36:40.000 --> 36:40.440
Get the fuck off him!

36:41.400 --> 36:44.000
What the hell are you doing, Joseph?

36:48.960 --> 36:53.440
Get off this property
before I call the police. Go on!

36:55.600 --> 36:56.000
You heard.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.640
You heard.

37:01.800 --> 37:03.440
Thanks.

37:08.720 --> 37:12.000
I don't deserve any sympathy,
especially not from you.

37:12.000 --> 37:12.880
I don't deserve any sympathy,
especially not from you.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.360
None of this is your fault.

37:19.120 --> 37:20.000
Why are we still talking about him?

37:20.000 --> 37:21.600
Why are we still talking about him?

37:22.840 --> 37:24.160
It's done.

37:24.880 --> 37:27.080
You're free.

37:27.120 --> 37:28.000
So am I.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.200
So am I.

37:29.240 --> 37:30.400
Yeah.

37:30.440 --> 37:32.880
I thought that's how I'd feel,
but...

37:34.680 --> 37:36.000
I don't know.

37:36.000 --> 37:36.320
I don't know.

37:37.160 --> 37:39.360
I don't feel anything.

37:43.760 --> 37:44.000
I know what we should do.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.880
I know what we should do.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.000
You sure about this?

38:00.000 --> 38:00.760
You sure about this?

38:11.320 --> 38:13.760
Habit.

38:16.480 --> 38:18.080
OK?

38:20.360 --> 38:22.080
Yeah.

38:58.080 --> 38:59.720
Wooh!

39:17.840 --> 39:20.000
Come on.
What?

39:20.000 --> 39:20.080
Come on.
What?

39:36.520 --> 39:38.080
What was that for?

39:38.120 --> 39:39.720
Try it!

39:41.480 --> 39:44.000
No!
You wanted to feel something. Do it!

39:44.000 --> 39:45.520
No!
You wanted to feel something. Do it!

40:03.200 --> 40:04.960
From here.

40:06.200 --> 40:08.000
Commit to it.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.080
Commit to it.

40:45.960 --> 40:47.920
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

40:47.960 --> 40:48.000
It's OK.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.960
It's OK.

41:27.520 --> 41:28.000
I'm sorry. What is going on?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.200
I'm sorry. What is going on?

41:32.560 --> 41:34.440
Ohh.

42:34.520 --> 42:36.560
We've done that before.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.120
Just the once. Yeah.

42:49.240 --> 42:51.400
Oh, my God.

43:05.720 --> 43:07.920
You gave me GHB.

43:09.240 --> 43:12.000
I didn't want to,
but you kept asking.

43:12.000 --> 43:12.240
I didn't want to,
but you kept asking.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.760
You wouldn't drop it.

43:13.800 --> 43:15.680
You gave me so much
I can't remember anything!

43:15.720 --> 43:19.440
We took the same amount. I'm sorry -
That's why I couldn't fight him off!

43:21.920 --> 43:26.360
Why didn't you tell me?
Cos I knew you'd feel like this.

43:29.960 --> 43:34.240
Oh, you were the one...
You were the one person I trusted.

43:34.960 --> 43:36.000
You CAN trust me.

43:36.000 --> 43:36.760
You CAN trust me.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.360
I chose you over my dad!

43:42.400 --> 43:44.000
Neve, I didn't know how to tell you!

43:44.000 --> 43:44.480
Neve, I didn't know how to tell you!

43:45.800 --> 43:47.720
Neve!
Just don't!

43:49.200 --> 43:50.680
Neve!

44:07.360 --> 44:08.000
Oh, my God.

44:08.000 --> 44:09.160
Oh, my God.
