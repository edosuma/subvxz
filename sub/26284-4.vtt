00:03.629 --> 00:05.506
<i>For most students, the weekend</i>

00:05.589 --> 00:07.133
<i>represented two days of fun,</i>

00:07.216 --> 00:09.677
<i>freedom, and in the case
of my brother,</i>

00:09.760 --> 00:12.596
<i>a chance to ignore
all forms of hygiene.</i>

00:15.725 --> 00:17.518
Come on, come on.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.395
<i>To me, however, it represented</i>

00:19.478 --> 00:21.439
<i>an unwelcome break
from education.</i>

00:25.401 --> 00:27.778
Whoo! Thank the Lord!

00:27.862 --> 00:30.156
<i>But this wasn't
a typical weekend,</i>

00:30.239 --> 00:32.241
<i>because this was the weekend</i>

00:32.323 --> 00:34.285
<i>I got to do my parents' taxes.</i>

00:34.368 --> 00:37.788
Howdy do, W-2.

00:37.872 --> 00:40.833
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

00:40.916 --> 00:43.586
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

00:43.669 --> 00:46.255
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

00:46.338 --> 00:49.216
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

00:49.300 --> 00:52.386
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man. ♪</i>

00:59.060 --> 01:01.395
"If you were not covered
by a retirement plan,

01:01.479 --> 01:05.816
but your spouse was,
see the worksheet on page 14."

01:05.900 --> 01:07.860
Try and stop me.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.613
Mom, I was going through
our expenditures

01:10.696 --> 01:13.032
and noticed our grocery bills
are up 12 percent compared

01:13.115 --> 01:15.201
to last quarter.
Any idea why?

01:15.785 --> 01:18.579
There's a person at the end of
the table that eats for free.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.748
There's a person at
the other end of the table

01:20.831 --> 01:22.333
that eats for three.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.836
I've been buying groceries
for the church food drive.

01:25.920 --> 01:27.254
I think that's it.

01:27.338 --> 01:29.215
Ooh, I bet I could
write that off,

01:29.298 --> 01:32.093
including the gas it took to
drive to the grocery store

01:32.176 --> 01:33.594
and then to the church.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.905
With all that driving,
maybe she can count

01:34.929 --> 01:36.097
her car as a home office.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.308
Sounds aggressive, but I like
how you're thinking.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.228
None of that is necessary,
it's for charity.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.897
What's the point of charity
if there are no tax benefits?

01:45.397 --> 01:46.524
Eat your peas.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.817
I like how he's thinking.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.527
You eat your peas, too.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.574
Dad, banking question.

01:55.658 --> 01:56.659
What's that, buddy?

01:56.742 --> 01:58.202
I noticed there's a check missing.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.246
I have a copy of check 128

02:00.329 --> 02:02.957
and a copy of check 130,
but 129 isn't there.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.876
Yeah,
don't worry about it.

02:05.960 --> 02:08.628
But I enjoy worrying;
I find it very relaxing.

02:09.213 --> 02:10.214
'Course you do.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.566
I balanced the rest
of the account,

02:11.590 --> 02:14.385
and it appears to be
a check for $300.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.762
All right, well,
let's just put it down

02:16.846 --> 02:18.848
for $300 for miscellaneous.

02:19.431 --> 02:22.059
I've never labeled anything
miscellaneous in my life.

02:22.143 --> 02:23.227
I'll go ask Mom.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.979
Wait.

02:25.855 --> 02:27.565
I just remembered.

02:29.567 --> 02:31.235
I gave the money to a friend.

02:31.318 --> 02:33.154
- Who?
- It doesn't matter who.

02:33.237 --> 02:34.572
Why'd you give it to them?

02:34.655 --> 02:37.241
They needed it.
It... it's like charity.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.743
Ooh, another write-off.
Excellent.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.287
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.876
What do you say
we keep this quiet?

02:46.959 --> 02:48.711
You mean like a secret?

02:48.794 --> 02:51.630
No, no, just, you know,
something between you and me.

02:51.714 --> 02:52.756
What about Mom?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.633
Mom is on a need-to-know basis.

02:54.717 --> 02:55.801
What if Mom needs to know?

02:55.885 --> 02:57.553
Okay, it's a secret.

02:58.095 --> 02:59.221
Just trust me.

02:59.305 --> 03:01.849
It is better for everyone
if she doesn't know about this.

03:01.932 --> 03:03.767
But I'm not good
at keeping secrets.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.853
It's not hard.
Just keep your mouth shut.

03:05.936 --> 03:07.605
But I'm not good
at keeping my mouth shut.

03:07.688 --> 03:11.692
Sheldon, all you got to do
is be cool.

03:14.028 --> 03:15.196
<i>"Be cool."</i>

03:15.279 --> 03:18.616
<i>He might as well have asked me
to fly around the backyard.</i>

03:20.701 --> 03:22.494
- Good night, baby.
- Night, Mama.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.122
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.584
Oh, hello.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.046
I was just brushing my teeth
like I do every night.

03:32.129 --> 03:34.173
Nothing new there.

03:34.256 --> 03:35.257
You all right?

03:35.341 --> 03:37.718
Yes. I'm cool.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.220
I'm very cool.

03:39.303 --> 03:41.013
Tell Sheldon what cool means.

03:41.096 --> 03:42.765
Hush.

03:42.848 --> 03:44.183
Sweet dreams.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.935
Love you.

03:46.018 --> 03:49.104
Love you, too,
'cause you're my mom.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.280
You're so weird.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.324
More than usual?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.327
No, I guess not.

04:03.869 --> 04:04.912
Perfect.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.165
<i>To avoid looking suspicious,</i>

04:08.249 --> 04:11.627
<i>I tried to interact with my mom
as little as possible.</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:14.797
<i>Thankfully, it's rude to speak
with your mouth full.</i>

04:14.880 --> 04:17.298
You look tired, baby.
Sleep okay?

04:17.382 --> 04:18.634
Mm-hmm.

04:21.095 --> 04:23.847
So how big a tax refund
you think we're gonna get?

04:24.848 --> 04:25.933
Mm.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.227
- Mornin'.
- Mornin'.

04:28.310 --> 04:29.937
I slept in the nude last night.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.981
Felt every little breeze.

04:32.690 --> 04:34.358
Thank you for sharing that.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.485
You're welcome.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.071
<i>Fight, you cowards, fight!</i>

04:39.154 --> 04:41.865
<i>You fight, Skeletor.</i>

04:42.700 --> 04:45.286
Mare, we got any batteries?!

04:45.369 --> 04:49.373
<i>Look in the drawer
by the refrigerator.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:51.625
<i>There was only
so much food I could eat,</i>

04:51.709 --> 04:54.753
<i>so I started avoiding my mother
whenever possible.</i>

04:58.132 --> 04:59.550
What are you doing in there?

04:59.633 --> 05:01.135
Keeping your secret.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.845
You got to pull it together.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.888
This is me pulling it together.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.682
- Pull harder.
<i>- Find 'em?</i>

05:06.765 --> 05:09.518
Yeah.
Got 'em. Thanks.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.021
You're very welcome.
Hey, have you noticed

05:12.104 --> 05:13.355
anything off with Sheldon?

05:13.439 --> 05:16.692
Uh, no, no, no.
Can't say that I have. Why?

05:16.775 --> 05:20.404
He's been awful quiet,
and at the risk of being indelicate,

05:20.487 --> 05:23.282
he's gone several days
without a bowel movement.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.742
How do you know that?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.744
Well, I was worried about him,

05:26.827 --> 05:28.370
so I took a look
in his potty journal.

05:28.454 --> 05:29.764
He's still keeping
that thing, huh?

05:29.788 --> 05:32.458
Oh, yeah, that's why he wanted
the Polaroid camera.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.669
Uh, well,
I'm sure he's gonna be fine,

05:35.753 --> 05:38.130
uh, but I'll keep an eye on him.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.799
- Thank you.
- You got it.

05:43.761 --> 05:46.680
- She's gone.
- Thank you.

05:46.764 --> 05:49.433
Batteries are in this drawer.

05:57.358 --> 05:58.817
We got a problem.

06:02.321 --> 06:04.090
I don't know how much longer
Sheldon can hold out.

06:04.114 --> 06:06.450
This is why I did not want you
to write a check.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.853
Well, I'm sorry,
but I didn't have

06:07.910 --> 06:09.328
that kind of cash
lying around.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.622
I do not want Mary to find out
about this.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.082
Well, what about Sheldon?

06:13.165 --> 06:15.751
The kid hasn't pooped in days.
He might pop.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.504
Slip a little Metamucil into
his apple juice, he'll be fine.

06:18.587 --> 06:20.172
Why don't we just come clean?

06:23.133 --> 06:24.593
All right, sure,
we could do that.

06:25.719 --> 06:28.180
You could rat me out
to Mary and...

06:28.764 --> 06:31.683
I could tell her what you did
at the church picnic.

06:31.767 --> 06:33.394
Come on.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.937
Now you're just playing dirty.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.523
We sink or swim together,
George.

06:37.606 --> 06:40.484
We sink or swim together.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.908
Grandmas are supposed
to be nice.

06:48.367 --> 06:50.119
What went wrong with you?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.583
<i>Avoiding my mother
in our own house</i>

06:56.667 --> 06:58.252
<i>was proving to be difficult,</i>

06:58.335 --> 07:00.921
<i>so it was time
to get creative.</i>

07:01.004 --> 07:04.758
Hello. I'd like to book a room
in your hotel.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.428
I'd be arriving tonight.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.681
No, it's just me.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.809
Ooh, a queen bed.
That sounds fancy.

07:13.892 --> 07:16.395
And how much
would this room cost?

07:17.688 --> 07:20.399
Wow. Is that per month?

07:21.150 --> 07:23.193
Per day?

07:24.027 --> 07:26.447
By any chance, do you have
a children's rate?

07:28.157 --> 07:30.659
We've been friends
for a while now, haven't we?

07:31.452 --> 07:32.828
I suppose so.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.414
Given that, how would you
feel about a sleepover?

07:35.497 --> 07:37.666
Sure. Your mom
lets you watch TV.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.168
<i>Jake and the Fatman</i>
is on tonight.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.628
I meant we could sleep
at your house.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.422
But you'll miss
<i>Jake and the Fatman.</i>

07:43.964 --> 07:45.799
Even better.
So what do you say?

07:47.134 --> 07:48.385
I'll have to ask my mom.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.221
Well, be sure to tell her
I'm clean, I'm well-behaved,

07:51.305 --> 07:52.574
and if you don't have
a lot of room,

07:52.598 --> 07:55.184
I can fit
in really tight spaces.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.023
So, your first sleepover.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.483
Pretty exciting, huh?

08:02.566 --> 08:05.402
No. It's not exciting,
it's constipating,

08:05.486 --> 08:07.571
and I'm only doing it
to avoid Mom.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.449
But still,
it's your first sleepover.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.242
It's fun stuff.

08:13.577 --> 08:15.579
Okay, I know you're having
a tough time with this,

08:15.662 --> 08:17.998
but... you're doing great.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.834
You spend some time
at Tam's house,

08:20.918 --> 08:23.837
you know, clear your head,
and come back home refreshed.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.339
And then I can tell Mom?

08:25.422 --> 08:26.798
Oh, no, you can
never tell Mom.

08:27.591 --> 08:29.801
Wouldn't it be easier
to just be honest?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.679
Usually, it would be, but...

08:32.763 --> 08:35.140
sometimes the truth
can hurt people.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.893
We wouldn't want
to hurt Mom, right?

08:37.976 --> 08:38.977
Of course not.

08:39.061 --> 08:40.479
Attaboy.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.361
Hey, here's a funny prank
you can try tonight.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.030
When Tam falls asleep, put some
shaving cream in his hand

08:50.113 --> 08:51.448
and then tickle his nose.

08:51.532 --> 08:52.950
Why?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.660
'Cause then he'll go to,

08:54.743 --> 08:55.803
you know, scratch his nose,

08:55.827 --> 08:57.829
and he'll get shaving cream
on his face.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.331
And then what?

08:59.414 --> 09:02.876
Well... that... that's it.

09:02.960 --> 09:04.586
But I'm a guest
in their home,

09:04.670 --> 09:06.338
and that doesn't seem
like a very good way

09:06.421 --> 09:07.756
to repay their kindness.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.008
Never mind.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.903
And what if the shaving cream
gets in his eyes?

09:11.927 --> 09:13.178
That would sting.

09:13.262 --> 09:14.513
Sorry I mentioned it.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.236
Also, I didn't bring
my own shaving cream.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.450
I'd have to use his dad's,
and that...

09:17.474 --> 09:19.268
Forget it!

09:25.607 --> 09:28.527
- Hello.
- Hi. You must be Mrs...

09:28.610 --> 09:29.778
Tam's mom.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.947
I'm Sheldon's dad,
George Cooper.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.030
Nice to meet you.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.741
Thanks for letting him
spend the night.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.368
It's his first sleepover.
He's excited.

09:36.451 --> 09:38.287
Actually, I'm quite apprehens...

09:38.370 --> 09:39.955
He's really looking forward
to it.

09:40.038 --> 09:41.373
Uh, in case something

09:41.456 --> 09:43.500
comes up,
just give us a holler.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.704
I mean, a call. If you hollered,
we wouldn't hear you.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.506
That-that was a joke.

09:51.842 --> 09:53.510
Okay, buddy, have fun.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.723
<i>Visiting Tam's house</i>

09:57.806 --> 10:00.434
<i>for the first time was
an emotional roller coaster.</i>

10:00.517 --> 10:03.520
<i>For example, it's traditional
in Vietnamese homes</i>

10:03.604 --> 10:06.607
<i>to have gruesome religious
iconography near the entrance.</i>

10:06.690 --> 10:08.442
<i>I did not like that.</i>

10:08.525 --> 10:10.694
<i>However, it's also customary</i>

10:10.777 --> 10:12.112
<i>to not wear shoes
around the house</i>

10:12.195 --> 10:14.239
<i>for sanitary reasons.</i>

10:14.865 --> 10:16.074
<i>I did like that.</i>

10:16.158 --> 10:17.909
<i>Interestingly,</i>

10:17.993 --> 10:20.287
<i>one of the main ingredients
in Vietnamese cooking</i>

10:20.370 --> 10:23.999
<i>is an extremely pungent
condiment known as fish sauce.</i>

10:24.082 --> 10:25.834
<i>I did not like that.</i>

10:25.917 --> 10:27.878
<i>But before every meal,</i>

10:27.961 --> 10:31.173
<i>it's common for everyone
to wash their hands and face.</i>

10:31.256 --> 10:32.924
<i>I did like that.</i>

10:33.008 --> 10:36.637
<i>Forks are not customary
in a Vietnamese household.</i>

10:38.930 --> 10:41.058
<i>I did not like that.</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:43.935
<i>And instead of napkins,
there was one towel</i>

10:44.019 --> 10:45.646
<i>for everyone
to share at the table.</i>

10:47.105 --> 10:49.900
<i>Seriously,
what are they thinking?</i>

10:51.193 --> 10:52.653
I can't help thinking
how odd it is

10:52.736 --> 10:55.364
that Shelly volunteered
to go on a sleepover.

10:55.447 --> 10:56.448
Oh, I don't know.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.325
- Hmm?
- He's growing up.

10:58.408 --> 11:00.786
It's natural for a young boy
to want to spread his wings

11:00.869 --> 11:02.621
a little bit,
try something new.

11:02.704 --> 11:03.955
That's nonsense.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.374
Last week,
I brought home

11:05.457 --> 11:07.226
the Raisin Bran
with the sugar on the raisins.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.211
He almost lost his mind.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.046
If you ask me,

11:11.129 --> 11:12.547
you're worried
about nothing.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.716
Maybe it's me.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.427
Maybe I did something
to upset him.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.304
What are you talking about?

11:19.388 --> 11:21.473
He loves you like crazy.

11:21.556 --> 11:23.517
Much more
than he loves this one.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.477
- It's true.
- I don't know.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.479
I just feel
like something isn't right.

11:28.730 --> 11:29.940
<i>Mom!</i>

11:30.023 --> 11:31.775
<i>I got my hair stuck
in my zipper!</i>

11:31.858 --> 11:34.027
That's the kid you need
to be worried about.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.408
Okay, Connie,
why don't we just come clean?

11:39.491 --> 11:41.576
- No.
- You heard her.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.537
Now she's blaming herself.

11:43.620 --> 11:44.705
And Sheldon's so upset

11:44.788 --> 11:47.082
he's... he's acting
like a regular kid.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.251
- All right, let's tell her.
- Thank you.

11:49.334 --> 11:51.437
But first I'm gonna tell her
what you did at the picnic.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.338
- Oh, Mary!
- Okay, okay, shh.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.154
I don't know how much longer
we can keep this going.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.597
I'm willing to find out.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.524
So, this game is called
<i>Mystic Warlords of Ka'a.</i>

12:12.607 --> 12:13.608
It's pretty fun.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.736
There are six kinds
of secret warlords...

12:15.819 --> 12:19.072
<i>- Secret warlords.
- It's a secret.</i>

12:19.156 --> 12:20.240
It's a secret.

12:20.323 --> 12:22.003
Have you noticed anything off
with Sheldon?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.285
Something between me
and you.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.995
Mom is on a
need-to-know basis.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.830
I took a little look
in his potty journal.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.166
- It's a secret.
- Several days without a bowel movement.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.001
- Sheldon.
- Secret. A secret.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.836
- A secret.
<i>- Sheldon.</i>

12:32.919 --> 12:34.421
Did you hear
anything I said?

12:35.255 --> 12:38.800
Sorry, I was reliving
a traumatic experience.

12:38.884 --> 12:39.884
What do you mean?

12:42.804 --> 12:45.140
Tam, I have a secret
that's weighing on me,

12:45.223 --> 12:46.892
and I need to tell someone.

12:46.975 --> 12:48.185
Okay. Tell me.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.187
But I promised I wouldn't.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.063
Okay. Then don't.

12:52.147 --> 12:54.065
But it's driving me crazy.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.442
Too bad you're not Catholic.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.902
You could confess
it to a priest.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.738
That's a great idea.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.656
You're Catholic.
I'll confess it to you.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.033
I'm not a priest.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.117
I'm not a Catholic.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.702
It makes perfect sense.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.747
Okay, whenever
you're ready.

13:09.956 --> 13:11.208
What are you doing?

13:11.291 --> 13:13.418
I'm assuming the position.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.961
Okay.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.839
Forgive me, Tam,
for I have sinned.

13:17.923 --> 13:19.716
This is my first confession.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.052
I forgive you, my son.

13:23.011 --> 13:26.640
I was doing my parents' taxes
and noticed a check was missing.

13:26.723 --> 13:28.493
- I asked my father about it...
<i>- As I walked Tam</i>

13:28.517 --> 13:30.227
<i>through the whole
sordid affair,</i>

13:30.310 --> 13:32.938
<i>I could feel a weight
lifting off my shoulders.</i>

13:33.021 --> 13:35.482
<i>It was a relief
to finally unburden myself</i>

13:35.565 --> 13:37.067
<i>of this deception.</i>

13:37.150 --> 13:38.735
<i>By the time I reached the end,</i>

13:38.819 --> 13:41.029
<i>I felt like a new person.</i>

13:41.112 --> 13:43.073
That's the whole story.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.534
Cool. Can we play now?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.494
<i>And now that my conscience
had been cleared,</i>

13:47.577 --> 13:50.205
<i>my colon was ready
to do the same.</i>

13:50.288 --> 13:53.458
Excuse me. I need
to use your bathroom!

14:01.758 --> 14:04.636
Thank you for letting me sleep
in your bed.

14:04.719 --> 14:07.472
My father taught me that
we must always honor our guests

14:07.556 --> 14:09.391
and treat them
with the utmost courtesy.

14:09.474 --> 14:12.310
The Vietnamese
are a very welcoming people.

14:12.394 --> 14:15.397
Yeah, that hasn't
always worked out for us.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.571
Do you think
your dad would ever ask you

14:22.654 --> 14:24.531
to keep a secret from your mom?

14:24.614 --> 14:25.699
Oh, no.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.909
He's so honest, it's annoying.

14:28.743 --> 14:29.870
Enough talking.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.204
Sleep now.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.458
She's just annoying.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.718
Well, you did it.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.638
How was your first sleepover?

14:51.766 --> 14:53.602
They feed you any weird food?

14:53.685 --> 14:55.770
When I was in 'Nam,
we ate fish soup for breakfast.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.608
Sheldon, I'm
talking to you.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.776
Well, I'm not talking to you.

15:02.360 --> 15:03.653
Okay, what's going on?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.031
After having my first
good night's sleep in a week,

15:06.114 --> 15:08.408
I woke up
with a fresh perspective.

15:08.491 --> 15:10.076
And that is...?

15:10.160 --> 15:11.745
It was irresponsible of you

15:11.828 --> 15:13.371
to burden me with that secret.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.166
Sheldon, we've been
through this.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.001
It's complicated.

15:18.084 --> 15:21.171
While I may not look up to you
from an intellectual standpoint,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.256
I've always looked up
to you as a role model.

15:27.010 --> 15:29.054
I can't do that anymore.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.559
And don't worry...
we made a deal.

15:34.643 --> 15:37.062
I'll continue
to keep your secret.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.532
Hey.

15:49.616 --> 15:50.825
What's up?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.994
Um, I need to tell
you something.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.204
What did you do?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.290
When Sheldon
was doing our taxes,

15:57.374 --> 15:58.959
he noticed a missing check.

15:59.042 --> 16:00.168
What did you do?

16:00.251 --> 16:01.729
Before I answer,
do you trust me enough

16:01.753 --> 16:03.713
to understand
it was for a good reason

16:03.797 --> 16:05.298
and j-just leave it at that?

16:09.970 --> 16:11.763
What did you do?

16:11.846 --> 16:13.658
It's all your mother's fault.
She is a bad person.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.433
I've been telling you for years.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.310
What did you do?

16:17.394 --> 16:19.312
Okay, now,
before I answer that...

16:19.396 --> 16:20.689
Just tell me
what you did.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.065
I got a DWI.

16:22.732 --> 16:23.858
Mom!

16:23.942 --> 16:25.485
It's not as bad as it sounds.

16:25.568 --> 16:27.904
How is driving drunk not bad?

16:27.988 --> 16:29.364
I wasn't exactly driving.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.700
I don't follow.

16:32.325 --> 16:33.952
I was at the dog track
with Georgie,

16:34.035 --> 16:35.412
and I had a few...

16:35.495 --> 16:36.746
<i>Georgie?</i>

16:36.830 --> 16:38.456
With God as my witness,

16:38.540 --> 16:40.792
I've never been to the dog track
in my life.

16:41.376 --> 16:42.794
She knows.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.337
Oh, I've been
there a bunch.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.673
Will someone please tell me
what happened?

16:46.756 --> 16:50.176
Okay, me and Meemaw were
in the bar at the track...

16:50.260 --> 16:52.137
You took him to a bar?

16:52.220 --> 16:53.763
He wasn't drinking.

16:53.847 --> 16:55.348
She had a few
too many margaritas,

16:55.432 --> 16:56.683
so I drove us home.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.393
But you don't have a license.

16:58.476 --> 17:01.312
That's why we swapped places
after the cop pulled us over.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.689
Oh, dear Lord.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.040
I had nothing to do
with this part.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.858
- Shut up.
- Will do.

17:05.942 --> 17:07.277
I didn't want Georgie

17:07.359 --> 17:08.528
to get into trouble,

17:08.611 --> 17:10.238
so I got behind the wheel

17:10.320 --> 17:12.073
before the cop
walked up.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.409
And then I got arrested,
and, uh,

17:14.492 --> 17:16.202
he bailed me out.

17:16.286 --> 17:18.621
So you all thought
you should keep this from me?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.080
- Absolutely.
- 100 percent.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.208
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen:

17:22.291 --> 17:23.877
You and you
are staying at her house

17:23.960 --> 17:25.920
until I say otherwise.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.964
One could argue I was
the hero in this story.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.967
You went gambling and you drove
without a license

17:31.051 --> 17:32.594
and you lied to my face.

17:32.677 --> 17:33.970
Heroically.

17:34.054 --> 17:35.680
Go.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.021
I love everything about this.

17:48.318 --> 17:49.819
I'm guessing you're mad at me.

17:49.903 --> 17:51.279
Aw, forget about it.

17:51.362 --> 17:53.073
I appreciate you not...

17:53.156 --> 17:55.700
ratting me out about the picnic.

17:55.784 --> 17:58.912
Well, we had a deal.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.123
Besides, your marriage
is already hanging by a thread.

18:02.207 --> 18:03.708
It is dangling there.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.378
All right, well,
I'm gonna turn in.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.880
Mmm.

18:08.963 --> 18:09.964
Good night.

18:11.549 --> 18:13.301
Night!

18:19.224 --> 18:20.225
Hello?

18:20.308 --> 18:21.601
So, get a load of this.

18:21.684 --> 18:23.937
Last church picnic,
your husband

18:24.020 --> 18:26.064
snuck in a six-pack,

18:26.147 --> 18:27.357
polished off the whole thing,

18:27.440 --> 18:29.818
then went to wait in line
for the bathroom...

18:29.901 --> 18:30.944
Hey.

18:31.027 --> 18:32.654
You got an extra toothbrush?

18:32.737 --> 18:34.405
Under the sink, darlin'.

18:34.489 --> 18:35.573
Thanks.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.076
You got it.

18:38.159 --> 18:42.038
So then the big gorilla decides
he doesn't want to wait in line,

18:42.122 --> 18:45.208
so he stumbles over
to the church vegetable garden

18:45.291 --> 18:49.546
and proceeds to irrigate
the whole damn thing.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.006
I've eaten those vegetables.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.801
Sweet dreams.
