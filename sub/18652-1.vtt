00:24.657 --> 00:30.254
The Whisperer in Darkness

02:03.756 --> 02:06.122
The whole matter began,
so far as I am concerned,

02:06.893 --> 02:09.520
with the unprecedented
Vermont floods of 1927.

02:24.477 --> 02:28.777
The rain poured down for days
and the flooding was extensive.

02:31.451 --> 02:33.043
It washed all kinds of things into the rivers,

02:33.586 --> 02:36.953
and people reported seeing
strange things floating in the water.

02:43.229 --> 02:46.528
As the flood waters receded,
there was a widespread tendency

02:46.599 --> 02:50.899
to connect these sights with a primitive,
half-forgotten cycle of whispered legend

02:51.171 --> 02:53.196
which old people resurrected forthe occasion.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.773
Many of my friends appealed to me to
shed what light I could on the subject.

04:39.245 --> 04:41.008
I thought all copies had been lost.

04:41.314 --> 04:43.214
Didn't Armitage have the last known one?

04:43.683 --> 04:46.675
I thought it was ruined in that business last year...

04:46.786 --> 04:48.083
Yes, that was the last known printed copy.

04:48.154 --> 04:51.783
This is Davenport's original manuscript.
And all his notes!

04:51.858 --> 04:52.825
The original?

04:53.059 --> 04:55.721
There's knowledge in those
pages that's recorded nowhere else.

04:57.697 --> 04:58.891
It's quite a find.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.791
What will you do with it? Another book?

05:02.001 --> 05:05.129
Sure, eventually. But right now I
have a more immediate use for it.

05:06.072 --> 05:10.133
I've been going over the notes in
preparation for this absurd "debate."

05:10.276 --> 05:14.076
That radio program? Albert,
you shouldn't do it.

05:14.180 --> 05:15.738
Dean Hayes insists!

05:15.948 --> 05:18.815
After all the back-and-forth
in the newspaper columns

05:18.918 --> 05:20.977
about the "bodies" washed
up in the recent flooding...

05:21.054 --> 05:22.612
You should have left it alone, Albert.

05:22.722 --> 05:23.746
I'm a folklorist, Nate!

05:24.023 --> 05:30.258
Nobody, nobody in this world knows more
about this particular area of folklore than I.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.628
And you think that with Davenport's notes...

05:32.699 --> 05:37.830
Exactly! Even a hundred years ago,
Eli Davenport was hearing the same stories.

05:38.771 --> 05:42.002
"A hidden race of monstrous
beings is said to lurk

05:42.075 --> 05:44.270
somewhere among the remoter hills -

05:45.645 --> 05:47.840
in the deep woods of the highest peaks.

05:48.281 --> 05:52.785
Evidence of their existence was seen
by those who ventured far up the slopes

05:52.785 --> 05:59.623
of certain mountains or in the deep,
steep-sided gorges

05:59.992 --> 06:03.325
that even the wolves shunned."

06:05.798 --> 06:10.167
Davenport collected countless
tales detailing their supposed origins.

06:10.803 --> 06:16.105
Here, look at this - illustrations
that have never been seen!

06:17.110 --> 06:21.945
Tales of settlers who vanished and
others who collaborated with the things.

06:22.448 --> 06:29.183
I'm familiar with... these legends.
And I'm sure you're right. But you can't debate it.

06:29.989 --> 06:33.359
I have to be there in less than an hour.
It's being aired on the N.B.C. Network

06:33.359 --> 06:34.326
Cancel it.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.890
You know who you're going up against?

06:38.998 --> 06:40.056
Charles Fort.

06:40.266 --> 06:45.761
And you think you can go on the radio and
debate a best-selling author with countless fans,

06:46.205 --> 06:48.867
the world's most prominent
expert on unexplained phenomena?

06:49.108 --> 06:50.410
How is this going to help your cause?

06:50.410 --> 06:51.809
Look, I can convince people...

06:51.911 --> 06:54.880
With the minutiae of
obscure New England folklore?

06:55.214 --> 06:56.806
You only stand to lose here.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.178
Nate, this is my life's work.

06:59.385 --> 07:04.023
The whole reason to study folklore is to
help us understand how and why we create myths.

07:04.023 --> 07:09.086
People can't keep believing that each
bolt of lightning is a spear thrown by Zeus!

07:09.195 --> 07:10.457
It isn't Zeus I'm worried about.

07:10.730 --> 07:14.300
OKnow, you're making this sound like one
of those nameless cults you investigate!

07:14.300 --> 07:17.235
I know you've had some rough experiences...

07:18.938 --> 07:22.305
I'm telling you, you have
nothing to gain from this debate.

07:22.742 --> 07:26.200
C'mon, your pal Charlie Tower will be there.

07:26.312 --> 07:28.007
He's footing the bill for the whole thing.

07:28.214 --> 07:32.742
Albert, I've met Fort. His style
may be strange, but he's smart.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.711
Be careful what you say.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.390
Perhaps I should have taken Nate Ward's advice.

07:51.337 --> 07:53.473
Charles Fort was popular
among the students

07:53.473 --> 07:56.840
for his open contempt for science
and his extravagant books.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.870
Charlie Tower, a friend and
wealthy Miskatonic alumnus,

08:00.012 --> 08:02.742
paid to bring him to campus for the debate.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.314
Tower had funded a number
of university expeditions,

08:05.952 --> 08:07.920
flew airplanes, travelled the world.

08:07.920 --> 08:12.118
He enjoyed stirring things up,
and had Dean Hayes wrapped around his finger.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.453
The host of the program was
some sort of toothpaste salesman

08:15.862 --> 08:17.887
not a moderator or journalist of any kind.

08:18.231 --> 08:23.794
I've collected books full of evidence in support
of the idea that there are worlds beyond our own,

08:24.103 --> 08:26.939
and people, creatures... call them what you will,

08:26.939 --> 08:28.839
that have come here from somewhere else.

08:29.275 --> 08:32.472
So you believe these creatures
are alien beings of some kind?

08:33.111 --> 08:36.548
I don't believe or
disbelieve anything, Mr. Bradbury.

08:36.816 --> 08:40.513
I merely note the long history
of remarkably consistent reports.

08:41.153 --> 08:45.556
The Pennacook Indians described similar things,
did they not, Professor Wilmarth, ages ago?

08:45.825 --> 08:48.191
Yes, they did, Mr. Fort. In fact...

08:48.327 --> 08:51.230
They said that the beings
were not native to this earth,

08:51.230 --> 08:53.255
that they had flown here from the stars.

08:53.833 --> 08:55.902
The later Puritan settlers described them too,

08:55.902 --> 08:57.570
as creatures in league with Satan,

08:57.570 --> 09:01.173
only too happy to lead
mankind down the path to sin.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.275
The folklore is abundant.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.938
My point is that it's the folklore
that lies behind the recent reports.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.449
Frightened people have
doubtless seen broken tree branches

09:10.449 --> 09:12.151
and other suggestive shapes in the water,

09:12.151 --> 09:15.985
and under the nervous strain of the moment have
let their imaginations get the better of them.

09:16.055 --> 09:17.989
But what lies behind the folklore?

09:18.391 --> 09:19.415
What do you say, Professor?

09:19.559 --> 09:22.962
Are you suggesting that
these legends are literally true?

09:22.962 --> 09:27.466
The descriptions of countless people,
across cultures and unconnected with each other,

09:27.466 --> 09:29.093
have been amazingly consistent.

09:29.535 --> 09:34.640
They're also consistent with
Nepalese tall tales of the dreaded Mi-Go

09:34.640 --> 09:37.507
or "Abominable Snow Man" of the Himalaya.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.367
I suppose you think
those are connected as well?

09:39.579 --> 09:42.070
Well, now that you mention it...

09:44.617 --> 09:50.385
So you're actually saying that people have
been seeing large, winged, crab-like beings

09:50.523 --> 09:51.547
in the rivers of Vermont?

09:51.891 --> 09:53.449
That's what I read in the papers.

09:55.194 --> 09:57.025
Forgive me, Mr. Fort, but that's preposterous!

09:57.463 --> 09:59.055
Compared to what?
Your explanation?

09:59.265 --> 10:02.068
You'd have us believe
that the farmers of Vermont

10:02.068 --> 10:04.637
can't tell a tree branch from a rock lobster!

10:04.637 --> 10:08.437
Your point of view has only one advantage:
It keeps everyone calm.

10:08.975 --> 10:12.645
Once a thing is explained away by"science",
it can be dismissed.

10:12.645 --> 10:15.047
Science doesn't strive to explain things away.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.413
Science is a method of arriving at the truth!

10:17.483 --> 10:20.519
And while it may have its faults,
it's better than relying on newspaper accounts!

10:20.519 --> 10:21.508
TouchÃ©, Professor.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.457
If the Arkham Advertiser had been in
publication two hundred and forty years ago,

10:24.457 --> 10:27.693
when the witch trials were under way,
we would no doubt have read reports

10:27.693 --> 10:31.527
that our town was beset by
witchcraft and dealings with Satan, right?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.424
From what I've heard of Arkham,
I'm sure we would!

10:34.567 --> 10:39.197
And even if each and every one of us
took such newspaper accounts at face value,

10:39.605 --> 10:43.302
and believed there were witches among us,
would that have made it true?

10:44.410 --> 10:48.642
It seemed to people in that time
and place that witchcraft was real.

10:48.714 --> 10:52.351
But a heritage of legend and
popular belief in a phenomenon

10:52.351 --> 10:55.218
isn't enough to make it true, is it, Mr. Bradbury?

10:55.621 --> 11:01.253
Cultural traditions and beliefs,
even superstitions, shape our view of the world.

11:01.327 --> 11:08.426
But the world is what the world is,
and if we are to progress beyond witch trials

11:09.068 --> 11:11.298
and superstition we must cultivate the discipline

11:11.537 --> 11:14.267
to separate objective fact from myth and fancy.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.475
The science of today is the witchcraft of yesterday.

11:17.576 --> 11:20.136
Today's superstition is tomorrow's science.

11:20.246 --> 11:23.181
Tell me, Mr. Fort, have you seen
one of these hill creatures yourself?

11:24.216 --> 11:25.410
Not personally, no.

11:25.718 --> 11:28.186
Is there any material evidence of their existence?

11:28.387 --> 11:31.254
Has one ever been photographed or recovered?

11:31.424 --> 11:33.551
Sent to a museum? Studied scientifically?

11:34.060 --> 11:38.764
Scientists seek only to prove or disprove
something that they have conceived of in advance.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.635
They may look, but they never see
anything more than they want to see.

11:42.635 --> 11:46.002
This from a man who sees little
green men from Mars everywhere he turns!

11:50.342 --> 11:54.039
I don't know what these
things in Vermont are, Professor.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.013
But, unlike you, I don't
pretend to know what they're not.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.448
I know they're not flying
crab-men from outer space!

12:00.653 --> 12:02.211
Gentlemen...
How do you know?

12:02.388 --> 12:05.221
Because you've "investigated"?
Have you even been to Vermont?

12:05.324 --> 12:07.690
Well, actually, no.

12:07.793 --> 12:10.159
Then how can you claim to know what they're not?

12:10.229 --> 12:11.597
Well, I...

12:11.597 --> 12:12.732
He's got you there, professor!

12:12.732 --> 12:14.500
No, no, I mean, they're not...

12:14.500 --> 12:19.597
The professor hasn't even been there.
So much for "scientific investigation"!

12:19.705 --> 12:22.299
Look, I don't have to see
them to know they're not real...

12:27.413 --> 12:32.180
I rest my case, Mr. Bradbury. It's all witchcraft!

12:35.688 --> 12:39.089
It was just the type of disaster Ward had foreseen.

12:39.525 --> 12:43.427
Worse still, it was to be followed by a
reception with Fort at the Faculty Club.

12:59.712 --> 13:01.202
Excuse me, professor?

13:01.647 --> 13:02.614
Yes?

13:03.282 --> 13:05.217
Hi, I was wondering if I
might have a moment of your time.

13:05.217 --> 13:06.852
I'd be glad to, but just now...

13:06.852 --> 13:11.619
My name is George Akeley. My father,
Henry Akeley, he's been writing to you.

13:12.324 --> 13:16.226
Yes, yes, I've exchanged
several letters with yourfather.

13:16.695 --> 13:22.395
He's a very bright fellow. His are some of
the most vivid letters I get from Vermont.

13:24.236 --> 13:27.473
He sent me here to see you. In person. I have...

13:27.473 --> 13:30.374
I'm afraid I have an engagement, I'm expected...

13:31.177 --> 13:32.838
My father needs your help!

13:33.879 --> 13:37.645
Yes, so he said. He said the hill
creatures are all around your farm.

13:38.417 --> 13:42.121
Yes. They are. And now everyone in the region

13:42.121 --> 13:44.790
thinks he's a lunatic thanks to
your letters to the newspapers.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.193
Well now, George, your father's
clearly a sensible and educated man

13:47.193 --> 13:49.428
and I have tremendous respect for him,

13:49.428 --> 13:52.731
but that doesn't mean I believe
every letter that comes to my desk...

13:52.731 --> 13:54.198
You mean you don't want to believe!

13:55.601 --> 13:57.159
I think Mr. Fort was right about you.

13:57.536 --> 14:00.699
Look, it's my job to study old legends,
not to believe in them!

14:00.873 --> 14:03.273
Wilmarth, everyone's waiting...

14:04.510 --> 14:05.499
Is there a problem here?

14:05.611 --> 14:11.106
No. Mr. Akeley here was just
attempting to continue tonight's debate.

14:12.318 --> 14:13.842
I'll be right there, Professor Ward.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.379
Good night.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.448
I have photos.

14:21.894 --> 14:23.122
Photos?

14:25.831 --> 14:28.200
My father made me promise to
show them to you. He also...

14:28.200 --> 14:29.292
Let's see them.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.300
No, not here.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.666
You have them with you now?

14:36.475 --> 14:38.568
We should get inside. Come with us.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.231
What is this, coffin varnish?

15:06.805 --> 15:10.434
Where's Wilmarth? You don't think he's
going to skip out on this blow, do you?

15:11.443 --> 15:12.467
He will if he's smart.

15:13.612 --> 15:14.806
He wasn't that bad...

15:18.250 --> 15:22.448
Well, I suppose I should get back in there.
After all, I am the host of this soirÃ©e.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.352
Ah, Albert! There he is!

15:25.824 --> 15:28.761
Albert, a good effort back there.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.785
Thank you, Lowell.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.593
I suppose I have you to thank for this,
Charlie. How have you been?

15:33.666 --> 15:37.500
I'm swell! Off to Peru next month,
surveying some new ruins.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.838
Say, you should come along!

15:39.838 --> 15:41.203
Oh, I don't know...

15:41.607 --> 15:43.642
Yes, yes! We need to get
you up in my aeroplane again.

15:43.642 --> 15:47.446
I didn't quite get the hang of it last time.
I think my shoulder's still sore.

15:47.446 --> 15:49.548
Nonsense! Sure, your landing was a bit rocky

15:49.548 --> 15:51.641
but once you were up in the
air you were fine, just fine!

15:52.418 --> 15:56.718
Besides, I don't know if a fellow
could crash any worse than you did tonight!

15:59.725 --> 16:00.851
And who's our young friend?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.859
Yes, this is George Akeley.

16:03.028 --> 16:04.461
Professor Jordan Lowell, astronomy.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.527
He's... from Vermont.

16:07.933 --> 16:10.766
Really? Wild country up there.

16:12.705 --> 16:16.801
Mr. Akeley here has something
to share with us. All of us.

16:18.377 --> 16:19.401
You don't say.

16:20.346 --> 16:21.438
What is it?

16:23.515 --> 16:24.573
Photographs.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.051
Of the...

16:26.051 --> 16:27.746
Well, let's see them.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.320
In the study. Fort should see them too.

16:31.457 --> 16:33.322
Good luck prying him away from Dean Hayes.

16:33.759 --> 16:37.525
Don't you worry about that.
I'll take care of him. Gentlemen...

16:54.313 --> 16:56.304
Mr. Akeley, after you.

17:02.588 --> 17:05.352
Thank you, Tower. That man's insufferable.

17:05.790 --> 17:11.559
Think nothing of it. Besides,
we have something you just might want to see.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.491
Gentlemen, I believe you already know Mr. Fort.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.398
What's all this about?

17:17.435 --> 17:20.030
My father has a farm in Townshend, Vermont.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.566
He's seen the creatures.
They're all around ourfarm.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.676
He's been corresponding with
Professor Wilmarth about it.

17:29.548 --> 17:32.915
He knew the professor didn't believe him,
so he asked me to bring these photos.

17:33.786 --> 17:38.382
He can't trust the post office;
his mail has been... interfered with.

17:38.557 --> 17:43.324
Well, this is exciting! Let's see them.
Photos might finally convince Wilmarth here.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.502
What is it?

17:50.502 --> 17:51.526
It's a footprint.

17:52.104 --> 17:55.107
We've seen these tracks all around the house,
the the river banks...

17:55.107 --> 17:56.734
You've seen the footprints yourself?

17:56.809 --> 17:57.798
Sure. Hundreds of them.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.543
Why didn't you say so before?

17:59.845 --> 18:01.005
You wouldn't have believed me.

18:01.647 --> 18:03.774
Akeley's handwriting is
nearly as bad as yours, Nate.

18:04.716 --> 18:08.846
It doesn't really look like a hoof or paw.
It looks like pincers or claws of some kind.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.955
Yes. Of course it could be
nearly anything. Deer most likely.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.682
What's this one?

18:14.660 --> 18:18.391
More tracks there. Akeley said
they live inside caves like this.

18:18.630 --> 18:19.688
They do.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.093
Lots of cave-dwelling deer in Vermont,
Professor Wilmarth?

18:25.771 --> 18:31.038
You can't really see the footprints on this one,
but the creatures dance around those stones.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.970
It's a shame the carvings are so hard to make out.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.572
There are stone circles of
this type throughout New England.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.119
There's no way to date the formation.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.848
It might have been erected
last month for all we know.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.055
You can make out the
carvings on this one pretty well.

18:47.192 --> 18:48.489
Look familiar?

18:58.937 --> 19:00.495
Where did he get that stone?

19:01.140 --> 19:05.076
He found it in the woods near
that cave and he brought it home.

19:05.878 --> 19:08.142
He thinks that's why the creatures
have been coming around the house.

19:08.847 --> 19:14.046
They'll do anything to get it back.
That's why he got the dogs. And the rifle.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.149
That your father, George?

19:19.191 --> 19:20.818
What's he doing with the gun?

19:21.593 --> 19:23.424
The creatures were trying to get into the house,

19:24.062 --> 19:26.792
so he shot one and I took this photo of the carcass.

19:27.566 --> 19:29.001
I don't see any carcass.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.969
I know. They don't...

19:33.572 --> 19:37.975
My father said they're made
of a different type of matter

19:38.076 --> 19:41.705
and their "molecules vibrate
at a different rate" from ours,

19:42.614 --> 19:44.673
so they don't register on ordinary film.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.515
How convenient.
What a shame.

19:46.785 --> 19:47.752
May I?

19:51.023 --> 19:54.660
There's never anything conclusive.
There's never real proof.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.861
Maybe it's better that way.

19:55.861 --> 19:57.522
Better? For who?

19:57.629 --> 20:00.826
Seems there's never a smoking
gun when you need one, eh Wilmarth?

20:02.000 --> 20:05.936
You said your father had seen the things,
but you never said whether you saw them.

20:12.778 --> 20:16.612
I've never actually seen a live
one up close, but they're there.

20:18.517 --> 20:22.817
We see the footprints! They're
real and they're all around our farm.

20:23.722 --> 20:28.750
I've seen them flying at night.
And... I've heard them talking.

20:29.728 --> 20:30.762
Talking?

20:30.762 --> 20:31.729
Yeah.

20:33.765 --> 20:34.857
What do they say?

20:35.300 --> 20:40.636
Sometimes they just sort of buzz and hum,

20:41.807 --> 20:46.141
but other times you can sort of
make out real words in your head.

20:48.146 --> 20:52.674
I don't understand it most of the time. "Shob Nig..."

20:52.751 --> 20:53.911
Look at this!

20:55.821 --> 21:00.190
These old viewers were used to study
stereo photographs of stars, to check parallax.

21:00.826 --> 21:02.760
They separate one eye from the other.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.231
They're normally useless on an ordinary photo,
but I thought it just might...

21:06.231 --> 21:07.630
I don't see anything.

21:08.066 --> 21:09.033
Here, let me...

21:24.950 --> 21:26.747
What the devil is going on in here?

21:27.886 --> 21:30.616
Members of your faculty and I were
just discussing matters of science

21:30.789 --> 21:34.623
with the esteemed Mr. Fort.
Surely, that's not a problem?

21:34.760 --> 21:39.131
Well, no, it's just... The Arkham
Advertiser would like a few photos

21:39.131 --> 21:43.158
of Mr. Fort and me.
And Wilmarth. They're waiting.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.067
Well, I assure you we won't keep them waiting.

21:48.006 --> 21:49.098
Run along now.

21:55.881 --> 22:00.118
Well, Wilmarth? Have you seen enough?
Are you a believer now?

22:00.118 --> 22:01.153
This could be proof!

22:01.153 --> 22:06.325
But it's not! It's... well, it's vague. It's all just...

22:06.325 --> 22:12.286
Open your eyes, Wilmarth. You'll never find proof,
but you might learn something.

22:12.731 --> 22:18.033
You should go to Vermont: Unless,
of course, you prefer to keep pretending.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.265
A pleasure to make your
acquaintance, young man.

22:21.406 --> 22:24.898
Thank you. They really are real...

22:25.944 --> 22:27.104
I'm sure they are.

22:27.946 --> 22:32.906
I can't take it any more. I told my dad, I'm leaving.
I'm going to go to San Diego.

22:34.119 --> 22:37.213
I've begged him to come with me,
but he he can't bear to leave the old family farm.

22:37.322 --> 22:42.385
I hear San Diego's nice. Although
it has rained shrimp once or twice.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.053
Good luck to you, son.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.124
We'd better go before Hayes blows a gasket.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.801
Wilmarth? Are you coming?

22:55.974 --> 22:59.740
Yes, Wilmarth, don't you want your
picture in the paper? Commemorate this evening?

23:00.178 --> 23:03.045
I'll be along. Let me see Mr. Akeley out.

23:12.090 --> 23:16.228
Listen, George, I'd like to
examine these more closely.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.195
Could I borrow them for a...

23:17.262 --> 23:20.823
Professor, I have something else.

23:20.966 --> 23:24.834
A phonograph recording. Of them.

23:25.971 --> 23:29.998
Them? You recorded the hill creatures?

23:30.142 --> 23:33.669
My father did. There's a
person's voice on it with them.

23:34.846 --> 23:41.684
There are people, a sort of cult,
that work in collusion with the creatures.

23:43.288 --> 23:48.920
I'll bring it to you. You can decide for yourself.

24:01.406 --> 24:05.900
Less than an hour later, George met me at
my office and left me with a wax cylinder.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.338
He begged me to go to
Vermont and help his father.

24:09.881 --> 24:10.982
Whatever was going on,

24:10.982 --> 24:15.817
it was clear that Henry Akeley believed he
was under attack, and his son was terrified.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.328
...so let the voices of the faithful ring out.

24:27.966 --> 24:33.268
So from the wells of night to the gulfs of space
and from the gulfs of space to the wells of night,

24:33.505 --> 24:35.941
everthe praises of Great Cthulhu

24:35.941 --> 24:39.809
of Tsathoggua and of Him
Who Is Not to Be Named.

24:40.145 --> 24:45.947
Ever the praises and abundance to the
Black Goat of the Woods. IÃ¤ Shub Niggurath!

24:46.151 --> 24:51.987
IÃ¤ Shub Niggurath! The Black Goat
of the Woods with a Thousand Young!

24:52.824 --> 24:58.456
Down the onyx steps he comes, hearing our call
bourne on the wings of night, out beyond space,

24:58.964 --> 25:03.901
out beyond the final gate to That
whereof Yuggoth is the youngest child,

25:04.102 --> 25:07.799
rolling alone in the black aether
at the rim to bring us tidings...

25:12.344 --> 25:14.107
Akeley recorded the things?

25:14.279 --> 25:19.376
Yes. It's labelled first of May, 1928.

25:19.584 --> 25:20.852
May Eve...

25:20.852 --> 25:23.480
Yes. Sounds like some kind
of a ritual, don't you think?

25:24.289 --> 25:28.089
Of course it's a ritual.
It's a wonder Akeley's still alive.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.525
He's a tenacious man, I must admit.

25:31.162 --> 25:35.189
You should read some of his letters, Nate.
They're... extraordinary.

25:36.468 --> 25:39.562
OK, now that one voice, now that
sounds to me like someone from Boston,

25:39.871 --> 25:45.207
but that other one, it hardly sounds human at all.
No matter how many times I listen to it...

25:47.145 --> 25:53.550
Don't play it again, Albert.
Stop answering Akeley's letters.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.321
And don't let Fort goad you
into doing something stupid.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.551
You're hell-bent on trying to
scare me off this thing, aren't you?

25:58.924 --> 26:03.884
You got Davenport's manuscript.
Let that be enough. Go write a book.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.928
And stop working my side of the street!

26:07.098 --> 26:09.999
You're an academic:
Stay indoors where you belong.

26:10.101 --> 26:13.537
Nate, maybe I was wrong about this...
I think there may really be something there.

26:15.006 --> 26:17.236
Akeley is living folklore!

26:19.244 --> 26:21.508
It's worth a look, in the name of science.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.381
Take it from me.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.383
You don't want to know.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.619
I took Ward's warning seriously.

26:38.229 --> 26:39.497
I planned to abandon the matter

26:39.497 --> 26:43.331
until Akeley wrote offering to
send me the mysterious black stone.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.331
I was eager to compare it to the
illustrations in Davenport's manuscript,

26:49.641 --> 26:53.907
so it was agreed that George would
bring it to Boston on his way to California.

26:54.145 --> 26:58.946
Akeley mistrusted the post, so I was to
meet George at North Station in Boston

26:59.284 --> 27:00.945
and he would give
it to me directly.

27:04.022 --> 27:08.982
Remember, Professor Albert Wilmarth.
Give it straight to him and no one else.

27:30.548 --> 27:35.008
George never met me in Boston.
Weeks went by without a word from him.

27:35.453 --> 27:38.547
The black stone was gone, and so was George.

28:03.148 --> 28:05.173
Henry and I had been corresponding for months.

28:05.750 --> 28:08.344
Recently, his letters grew increasingly fearful.

28:08.520 --> 28:13.583
Even his handwriting showed the strain as he
told of unknown things closing in around him,

28:13.725 --> 28:16.717
so his next letter came as a complete surprise.

28:18.263 --> 28:19.992
My dear Wilmarth,

28:20.198 --> 28:24.032
pardon this typed letter,
but my handwriting has grown shaky of late

28:24.436 --> 28:27.166
and I don't
feel equal to long stretches of script.

28:28.039 --> 28:32.635
Allow me to set you at rest regarding all the
silly things I've been writing you.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.379
I say "silly", although by
that I mean my frightened attitude

28:37.449 --> 28:40.316
rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena.

28:40.418 --> 28:43.615
My mistake had been in establishing
a hostile attitude toward them.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.219
What I thought morbid and frightful

28:46.291 --> 28:50.318
is in reality awesome and
mind-expanding and even glorious.

28:51.262 --> 28:54.766
I chalk up my previous
attitude to man's eternal tendency

28:54.766 --> 28:58.258
to hate and fear and shrink
from the utterly different.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.431
Now that all is safe, I'd like
you to share in my discoveries.

29:03.641 --> 29:05.609
Please come soon so we can discuss them.

29:06.211 --> 29:10.443
Bring along the recordings and all my
letters to you and the Kodak prints too.

29:11.116 --> 29:15.052
We shall need them in piecing
together the whole tremendous story.

29:16.087 --> 29:17.349
Please come immediately.

29:17.622 --> 29:21.183
Send me a wire and my car will
meet you at the Brattleboro station.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.292
What do you think, Theobald?

29:36.141 --> 29:40.100
It was such a relief,
that letter, and yet distrubing too.

29:40.478 --> 29:44.107
The complete change of mood was peculiar.

29:45.450 --> 29:48.214
In the end, I decided to go
to Vermont and see for myself.

29:51.156 --> 29:53.358
I neglected to tell anyone where I was going.

29:53.358 --> 29:57.192
I suppose I didn't want Ward to
attempt to thwart my burning curiosity.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.745
Mr. Wilmarth, I presume?

30:26.391 --> 30:28.086
Yes. I'm Albert Wilmarth.

30:28.293 --> 30:30.557
P.F. Noyes, at your service.

30:30.695 --> 30:34.324
Henry Akeley asked if I'd do him the
favor of giving you a lift up to the farm.

30:34.499 --> 30:35.557
I thought he'd come himself.

30:36.668 --> 30:37.828
He has not been well.

30:39.604 --> 30:40.628
Is that all your belongings?

30:41.739 --> 30:43.441
Allow me.
No thanks, I'll take that.

30:43.441 --> 30:46.376
No, no, I insist.
Follow me.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.485
Is Henry all right? His last
letter didn't say anything...

30:54.485 --> 30:57.511
It's a sudden attack of some kind of asthma.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.192
He said he was not up for the trip
in this weather but not to worry,

31:01.192 --> 31:02.819
he'd be his old self again before long.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.329
Right this way...

31:09.667 --> 31:10.827
Get in the car.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.466
I don't bite, Mr. Wilmarth. Get in.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.217
You're from Miskatonic University?

31:33.958 --> 31:35.926
Yes, that's right.

31:37.595 --> 31:40.325
I'm in the English Department. I'm a folklorist.

31:42.267 --> 31:45.259
And what brings you to our folksy back woods?

31:46.471 --> 31:50.840
Henry asked me... to pay him a visit.

31:52.877 --> 31:55.471
Well, hopefully you won't regret the trip.

31:57.448 --> 31:58.437
Why would I?

31:58.917 --> 32:01.408
Beastly weather like this can spoil anything.

32:02.687 --> 32:10.560
Do you... have you ever been on the wireless?
Your voice sounds so familiar.

32:11.596 --> 32:12.790
I get that a lot.

32:13.431 --> 32:17.629
No, no, just a frustrating brush
with amateur dramatics in my youth.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.529
I played Brutus in Julius Caesar once.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.203
"Brutus is an honourable man."

32:24.976 --> 32:26.500
Quite.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.475
Have you set your watch back?

32:34.585 --> 32:41.286
We're in Vermont now: We'll have none of these
new-fangled daylight-saving schemes, good sir!

32:47.899 --> 32:51.858
I think you'll find time runs differently here.

33:09.387 --> 33:11.480
Wild country, eh, Mr. Wilmarth?

33:11.923 --> 33:12.890
Indeed.

33:13.524 --> 33:17.620
Not like the big cities on the coast,
or your academic towns.

33:18.830 --> 33:26.362
Our storied hills and legend-haunted
mountains of any professional interest for you?

33:26.671 --> 33:30.539
Oh, I don't know.

33:36.481 --> 33:40.645
It's altogether older and more primitive here.

33:42.387 --> 33:43.411
Unspoiled.

33:45.923 --> 33:47.481
Ancestral, really.

33:49.827 --> 33:56.790
You can almost feel that continuous
native life that keeps alive ancient memories, and

33:57.769 --> 34:00.431
shadowy, strange beliefs.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.001
I'd have thought Henry would
have told you plenty about that.

34:05.643 --> 34:06.837
He hasn't said too much.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.402
Good. We wouldn't want
him scaring you off now, eh?

34:19.824 --> 34:20.984
Now what's this?

34:36.440 --> 34:37.635
What's the trouble, Walter?

34:39.476 --> 34:42.105
Flood's damaged the bridge.
You'll have to turn round.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.648
I'm trying to take Mr.
Wilmarth here up to Akeley's place.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.552
You can't take a car across, she may not hold.

34:49.687 --> 34:50.847
Can you still walk across?

34:51.489 --> 34:56.051
Aye-yep. Laid down planks.
Ye can cross a-foot. For the present.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.691
It's quite a frightful detour if we go around.

35:02.133 --> 35:05.500
Could take us four or five hours in this weather.

35:06.504 --> 35:08.438
On foot you'll be there in less than an hour.

35:08.706 --> 35:09.673
I see.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.742
Probably best if you cross a-foot.

35:12.777 --> 35:14.642
Walter, do you think this rain is going to let up?

35:15.780 --> 35:18.578
I don't reckon. Looks like a bad night.

35:19.150 --> 35:21.880
Might want to get a move on, get up to Akeley's.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.589
Don't want to dilly-dally. A man could get...

35:24.589 --> 35:26.921
Now then, Walter, we don't want to scare the man.

35:28.659 --> 35:30.718
I'm the last thing he should be afraid of.

35:32.463 --> 35:35.557
Of course I don't mind taking you on the detour.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.598
No, no, I'll manage.

35:47.912 --> 35:51.643
Here, take my umbrella. I insist.

35:52.617 --> 35:54.050
Thank you. I'll leave it with Akeley.

35:54.585 --> 35:58.783
Now Henry might be resting when you get there,
and with this weather he mightn't hear you knock.

35:58.890 --> 36:01.085
But he's expecting you,
so you can just let yourself in.

36:02.627 --> 36:03.628
Are you sure?

36:03.628 --> 36:04.925
Oh sure, he won't mind.

36:05.563 --> 36:06.757
Well, thank you.

36:07.198 --> 36:08.460
Not at all.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.027
I'll be seeing you, Mr. Wilmarth.

37:03.187 --> 37:05.519
Excuse me, hello? Hello?

37:09.160 --> 37:11.253
Sorry to trouble you, can you tell me the way to...

37:11.796 --> 37:12.763
The Akeley place?

37:13.097 --> 37:15.725
Yes. How did you...

37:16.667 --> 37:18.066
We don't get many visitors around here.

37:18.703 --> 37:19.692
What's your business?

37:20.671 --> 37:21.638
My business?

37:23.174 --> 37:24.198
Henry invited me.

37:25.943 --> 37:26.967
As his guest.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.544
Invited, eh?
Yes, that's right.

37:31.782 --> 37:32.806
You come alone?

37:32.917 --> 37:38.287
I did. A Mr. Noyes brought me in
from Brattleboro, but the bridge is...

37:40.091 --> 37:42.218
Noyes? You know him too?

37:43.027 --> 37:45.894
No. Honestly I was surprised
Henry didn't pick me up himself.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.095
Mr. Noyes said he'd been unwell.

37:55.172 --> 37:58.801
Rain's going to keep coming
down all night. Best stay indoors.

38:00.645 --> 38:03.637
You'll find the Akeley's place
back up on the road, overthe rise.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.814
You can cut through the field, past the barn.

38:10.821 --> 38:12.755
Thank you, mister...

38:14.792 --> 38:16.123
Masterson. Will Masterson.

38:16.294 --> 38:17.852
Hannah! Get back! Hannah!

38:21.632 --> 38:23.293
Not much of a day for hunting, is it?

38:25.169 --> 38:26.693
'Pends on what you're hunting for.

40:26.223 --> 40:29.989
Mr. Akeley? It's Albert Wilmarth. I'm here.

41:33.157 --> 41:36.524
Mr. Wilmarth, at last.

41:38.863 --> 41:42.162
Pardon my not rising, but I've been taken ill,

41:42.867 --> 41:46.030
as I'm sure Mr. Noyes must have told you,

41:47.171 --> 41:50.538
but I could not resist
having you come just the same.

41:52.943 --> 41:56.208
Yes. How are you feeling?
Can I get you anything?

41:56.313 --> 42:00.079
No, no. I know these old spells.

42:01.252 --> 42:02.514
I just need some rest.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.313
Here, let me open up the curtains...

42:05.456 --> 42:07.083
Just a little, if you please.

42:09.093 --> 42:12.096
When I'm ill like this my eyes
are quite sensitive to the light.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.929
Oh, of course. I'm sorry.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.102
I'm so pleased you're here in person.

42:21.305 --> 42:23.034
There's so much to discuss.

42:24.475 --> 42:28.411
You have the Kodak prints and
the phonograph record? The letters?

42:28.512 --> 42:34.917
Sure I do. And a manuscript of old
folklore which I'm sure you'll find of interest.

42:35.119 --> 42:37.417
Unexpected. And wonderful.

42:38.622 --> 42:41.250
Set them on the table there
and we'll discuss them tonight.

42:42.560 --> 42:43.527
Will you be up to it?

42:44.395 --> 42:49.594
Oh, yes. I'm just a little
weak right now but I'll be fine.

42:51.468 --> 42:54.130
Your room is upstairs, above this one.

42:54.572 --> 42:59.339
And there's a meal laid out for you in
the dining room, through that door there.

43:01.145 --> 43:02.544
I'll be a better host tomorrow;

43:03.414 --> 43:05.075
these spells leave me spent.

43:05.616 --> 43:06.583
It's quite alright.

43:07.318 --> 43:09.878
I'm tired myself. The bridge was out.
I had to walk up here.

43:10.321 --> 43:11.481
How unfortunate.

43:13.090 --> 43:16.389
Please, dry off and make yourself at home.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.989
I'll rest until after dusk
and then we will talk some more.

43:22.967 --> 43:25.435
We have so very much to discuss!

43:29.974 --> 43:32.499
Henry, I don't suppose you've had
any further word from George, have you?

43:38.148 --> 43:39.206
Yes, your...

43:39.283 --> 43:41.444
Ah yes, George.

43:43.420 --> 43:47.481
Yes, he sent a telegram from
California. He was delayed.

43:48.592 --> 43:50.492
That's wonderful news! What a relief.

43:50.694 --> 43:51.695
Yes.

43:51.695 --> 43:54.129
And the black stone? Does he still have it?

43:56.467 --> 43:58.196
That's of no importance now.

44:01.972 --> 44:06.306
Do you realise the stupendous
nature of what lies before us?

44:12.282 --> 44:13.408
Henry, you...

44:13.550 --> 44:14.574
Forgive me.

44:19.623 --> 44:21.591
My enthusiasm runs ahead of me,

44:23.027 --> 44:24.289
and I should rest.

44:25.529 --> 44:26.655
We will talk later.

44:28.966 --> 44:32.663
Set out the items from your bag, take a bite,

44:34.171 --> 44:38.267
make yourself comfortable and we
shall have our chat.

44:43.714 --> 44:44.942
I'll stay here.

44:46.684 --> 44:47.651
Rest.

46:35.092 --> 46:36.184
I thought you might like some Ovaltine.

46:40.497 --> 46:42.089
Did you find the meal laid out for you?

46:42.699 --> 46:46.135
Yes, thank you. Very kind of you.

46:49.606 --> 46:50.664
I'lljust set this right here.

46:56.380 --> 47:00.817
So, Henry, are you feeling up to our conversation?

47:03.487 --> 47:08.151
Wilmarth. Yes. Conversation.

47:10.227 --> 47:12.161
Do we have all your evidence at hand?

47:13.297 --> 47:14.662
It's all right here on the table.

47:15.799 --> 47:16.788
Good.

47:18.168 --> 47:20.500
I never should have sent you
any of those things, you know.

47:21.138 --> 47:22.867
Such a lot of bother, and all for nothing.

47:24.608 --> 47:25.734
What do you mean?

47:25.876 --> 47:27.810
There was never any reason to fear them.

47:29.646 --> 47:32.206
It was foolish to interfere with their doings.

47:33.383 --> 47:36.648
Men simply can't understand their great purpose.

47:36.787 --> 47:37.754
Hold on, Henry.

47:38.455 --> 47:42.721
I came here prepared to accept there were
undiscovered creatures living in these hills, but

47:44.328 --> 47:46.125
a "purpose"? Really now...

47:46.496 --> 47:48.430
I've spoken to them, Wilmarth.

47:50.334 --> 47:51.401
You've what?

47:51.401 --> 47:57.601
Oh, yes. They've told me things that
neither you nor I had ever begun to guess.

47:59.309 --> 48:02.574
We misjudged the purpose of
their secret colony on this planet.

48:03.313 --> 48:05.144
You saw and spoke to them?

48:05.582 --> 48:09.382
They are not unwilling to share
their great secrets with mankind.

48:10.554 --> 48:12.419
Secrets of the universe itself.

48:12.856 --> 48:17.520
OK, Henry, so they choose humans to talk to,
just like in the folklore.

48:23.867 --> 48:29.567
The folklore... All your legends
about what they've offered to men,

48:30.407 --> 48:32.398
and what they wish in connection with the earth,

48:32.976 --> 48:37.436
are based on man's misconceptions
of allegorical speech.

48:38.415 --> 48:45.753
Your most educated experts understand them no
betterthan illiterate farmers or savage natives.

48:46.256 --> 48:47.450
Alright Henry,

48:48.592 --> 48:49.581
what is it they want?

48:52.329 --> 48:53.523
Shall I tell you?

48:57.467 --> 48:58.559
Are you ready?

49:01.004 --> 49:02.266
Come closer.

49:03.907 --> 49:06.705
Let me whisper it to you.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.688
Even now I could not repeat
the terrible things I heard whispered

49:17.688 --> 49:21.488
that evening in the
darkened room among the lonely hills.

49:23.593 --> 49:28.621
What he had learned from the Outside
Things was almost too much for sanity to bear.

49:29.566 --> 49:31.268
It was shocking to have the foulest nightmares

49:31.268 --> 49:34.362
of secret myth revealed in concrete terms,

49:34.805 --> 49:35.829
and yet

49:36.440 --> 49:40.501
Akeley now seemed reconciled to the
whole fiendish system he had stumbled upon.

49:52.556 --> 49:54.786
I'm going with them, Wilmarth.

49:58.862 --> 50:00.329
Going with them?

50:01.398 --> 50:02.365
Where?

50:04.368 --> 50:05.960
Their main immediate abode

50:06.970 --> 50:09.302
is a still undiscovered, almost

50:09.973 --> 50:13.500
lightless planet at the
very edge of our solar system.

50:15.479 --> 50:19.848
It is referred to as "Yuggoth"
in some of your precious folklore.

50:21.818 --> 50:26.551
When the time is right, they'll
permit human observers to detect it.

50:29.459 --> 50:31.689
But Yuggoth is just a stepping stone.

50:33.563 --> 50:37.727
Later, I'll cross incalculable gulfs of space,

50:38.535 --> 50:41.402
bending time to allow for temporal journeys.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.666
The things can carry you through space?

50:45.509 --> 50:48.842
Human bodies are not suited
forthe journey like theirs are.

50:49.813 --> 50:52.338
But they've solved the
challenge with their surgical,

50:52.449 --> 50:54.383
mechanical, and chemical skills.

50:54.484 --> 50:56.975
Surgical? Henry, you don't mean...

50:59.823 --> 51:00.812
This is madness!

51:00.891 --> 51:03.553
No, it's true.

51:05.996 --> 51:11.525
The human body cannot make the journey,
but in their care, the human mind

51:12.135 --> 51:15.366
can venture to the most
distant corners of the universe.

51:17.474 --> 51:22.673
They surgically extract the brain and
suspend it in a fluid-filled cylinder

51:22.946 --> 51:24.846
they have ingeniously engineered.

51:26.917 --> 51:32.651
Freed from the constraints of your
biological frailty, the mind lives on

51:33.757 --> 51:38.462
in an experience far beyond
anything accessible to mere man.

51:38.462 --> 51:42.091
No, Henry. I can't believe this.

51:45.802 --> 51:46.860
Of course not.

51:49.539 --> 51:50.767
Go over to the hutch there

51:53.543 --> 51:54.703
and remove the cloth.

52:24.908 --> 52:26.398
What are these?

52:26.843 --> 52:29.607
Not "what,"Albert, but "who."

52:34.684 --> 52:35.742
These contain?

52:35.852 --> 52:39.754
Yes, Albert. Three are human.

52:40.490 --> 52:46.019
The rest are, well... in the cave in
Round Hill there are beings of all sorts,

52:46.930 --> 52:48.921
from more interesting places.

52:50.800 --> 52:55.134
We can connect them to sensory
apparatus you literally cannot imagine.

52:56.873 --> 53:01.901
Place the one marked B-67 onto the table.

53:12.722 --> 53:13.689
Good.

53:15.158 --> 53:18.127
Now, connect the tube into the recess.

53:19.796 --> 53:21.195
There on the side.

53:24.668 --> 53:25.635
Excellent.

53:27.137 --> 53:30.470
Please, connect the other devices as well.

53:36.880 --> 53:40.043
Excellent. That will engage the device...

53:50.794 --> 53:54.753
Look, Akeley, I'm not falling for some
spectacular parlour trick with a radio...

53:54.831 --> 53:57.664
Nor do we expect you to, Mr. Wilmarth.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.732
I don't mean to alarm you.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.635
I am a human being, like yourself.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.172
My brain is in the cylinder and I see,

54:12.015 --> 54:14.506
speak and hear through these ingenious vibrators.

54:15.185 --> 54:18.722
My body is being properly vitalised
and cared for in a storage facility

54:18.722 --> 54:19.689
not far from here.

54:20.690 --> 54:21.748
Do you understand?

54:24.227 --> 54:25.194
Excellent.

54:26.062 --> 54:29.589
Soon Mr. Akeley and I will
leave here on an incredible journey.

54:30.200 --> 54:31.258
We hope you will join us.

54:32.936 --> 54:35.666
Do you mean to say that your brain, that this...

54:36.139 --> 54:37.106
That's right.

54:37.674 --> 54:41.735
I met them years ago in the
Himalaya and helped them in various ways.

54:42.178 --> 54:46.672
In return, they rewarded me with
experiences few men have ever had.

54:47.951 --> 54:49.213
You... wanted this?

54:49.853 --> 54:51.218
Think about it, Mr. Wilmarth.

54:51.755 --> 54:54.324
Do you understand what it
means when I say I have been

54:54.324 --> 54:56.315
on thirty
seven celestial bodies

54:57.093 --> 54:59.061
- planets, dark stars,

54:59.296 --> 55:03.665
even objects purely outside
the curved cosmos of space and time?

55:04.367 --> 55:05.561
Of course you do.

55:06.269 --> 55:07.668
And of course, you cannot.

55:09.172 --> 55:11.374
You travel in space and survive?

55:11.374 --> 55:13.706
The cylinders are made for such a purpose.

55:13.910 --> 55:17.573
Further, My brain is immune
from disease here, and even age.

55:17.714 --> 55:20.911
And my body is perfectly
preserved if I ever wanted it again.

55:21.318 --> 55:22.580
But I doubt that I will.

55:23.653 --> 55:27.783
We will talk some more
tomorrow about you coming with us.

55:28.224 --> 55:29.316
I hope you will.

55:30.160 --> 55:33.152
The visitors are eager to
know men of knowledge, like you.

55:33.730 --> 55:36.665
It may seem strange at first to meet them,

55:37.267 --> 55:39.292
but I know you'll be above minding that.

55:40.270 --> 55:44.104
I think Mr. Noyes, the man who brought
you up in his automobile, he'll come too.

55:44.741 --> 55:47.904
No doubt you recognised his voice
from the recordings Henry sent you.

55:48.912 --> 55:50.777
That was Noyes, on the recordings!

55:51.848 --> 55:53.611
It is completely painless.

55:54.084 --> 55:58.077
When the devices are disconnected,
one merely drops off into a deep sleep

55:58.388 --> 56:00.379
with vivid and fantastic dreams.

56:01.257 --> 56:02.690
Of course, it's up to you,

56:03.760 --> 56:04.954
but I hope you'll consider it.

56:05.929 --> 56:08.227
But for the moment, would you be
so good as to disconnect me?

56:10.233 --> 56:14.033
Mr. Akeley, I expect you to treat our guest well.

56:16.172 --> 56:17.969
Good night, Mr. Wilmarth.

56:32.222 --> 56:37.751
I'm afraid all this excitement has taken
its toll on me and I should like to rest.

56:40.263 --> 56:41.753
Take the lamp with you.

56:43.433 --> 56:45.230
Just leave the machines where they are.

56:53.843 --> 56:54.969
A bit shocking, isn't it?

56:56.813 --> 56:59.338
Never mind. Sleep on it.

57:01.317 --> 57:02.909
Good night, Albert.

57:03.186 --> 57:04.153
Yes,

57:06.022 --> 57:06.989
good night, Henry

59:24.961 --> 59:28.453
He lacks imagination, and his spirit is weak.

59:29.933 --> 59:31.924
He is not worthy of N'gah-Kthun.

59:32.902 --> 59:36.429
To us he's no more interesting
than your goldfish in a bowl.

59:37.006 --> 59:40.510
But this is an outrage! This is not
how it was presented to me. I demand-

59:40.510 --> 59:42.111
You're in no position to make demands.

59:42.111 --> 59:45.012
You wouldn't be here at all
if it weren't for Davenport!

59:47.317 --> 59:49.410
We can eliminate him for you, if you wish.

59:52.322 --> 59:56.383
He may still be of use to you
in this night's great business.

59:56.459 --> 01:00:01.362
The opening of the passage may yet
be smoothed by the use of a sacrifice.

01:00:14.077 --> 01:00:15.339
Go.

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:11.566
Long have we waited for
the opening of the passage.

01:01:12.969 --> 01:01:16.496
That most sacred duty falls to
me and I will not give it up.

01:01:18.241 --> 01:01:22.302
I know the cost, and it is
my honour to serve the Mi-Go.

01:01:24.147 --> 01:01:27.116
And if this Wilmarth stands in my way,

01:01:29.085 --> 01:01:30.074
I will eliminate him.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:32.617
Never have I heard such a misguided speech.

01:01:32.755 --> 01:01:36.156
We work with the Mi-Go for the
betterment of the human race.

01:01:36.659 --> 01:01:40.356
You would presume to travel to Yuggoth only
for your own gain of knowledge from beyond!

01:01:40.596 --> 01:01:45.533
Insignificant fool! Have you truly
learned nothing from your masters?

01:01:46.169 --> 01:01:49.036
By their will alone you are kept alive,

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:53.169
and by my continued patient indulgence.

01:01:53.609 --> 01:01:58.103
I am the opener of the gate
and you will not dictate to me!

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.625
It would be no difficulty to eliminate him.

01:02:19.368 --> 01:02:21.097
I can do it tonight if you command it.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:27.199
This discussion itself distracts us
from greater matters that cannot wait.

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:28.610
I won't listen to any...

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.220
Do you really dare to defy us?

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.255
Please! I never meant to offend...

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.014
Mr. Noyes, please stop!

01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:45.586
He's right: Eliminating
Wilmarth was never part of the bargain.

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:50.262
I don't mean to question your authority,
but never did anyone tell me...

01:02:55.772 --> 01:02:57.706
You don't know what devotion means.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:04.074
Clearly neither of you has
faith in our great purpose.

01:03:07.216 --> 01:03:10.379
But not to worry, my dear, dear friend,

01:03:10.686 --> 01:03:13.382
I shall show you the meaning of faith now!

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.316
Go upstairs and get Wilmarth.

01:04:33.236 --> 01:04:35.363
Don't let them see you. Run.

01:04:36.939 --> 01:04:38.531
I can't just leave Mr. Akeley in there...

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:41.601
I... can't.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:46.871
I can't.

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:50.352
Wait...

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:55.913
Mr. Noyes,

01:04:58.261 --> 01:04:59.751
Wilmarth's gone! He must have jumped from

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.964
the upstairs window and fled!
I couldn't see him nowhere...

01:05:01.964 --> 01:05:05.491
I told you to make sure he stayed here.
Imbecile!

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:12.235
Daddy, I just saw a strange
man running towards the bridge.

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:15.839
Hannah, what are you doing here?
I told you to stay inside at home.

01:05:16.312 --> 01:05:17.643
That's Wilmarth. Let's go.

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:19.778
Right.
Hannah, stay here.

01:05:49.478 --> 01:05:50.945
The girl said he was heading for the bridge.

01:05:51.013 --> 01:05:52.503
Maybe we can cut him off...

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.345
We have more important matters to attend to.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.285
The time is now.

01:05:59.889 --> 01:06:01.880
You, bring him to the ritual.

01:06:02.758 --> 01:06:04.419
If he resists, kill him.

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:18.727
Henry?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:21.654
Henry Akeley? Is it you?

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:24.490
Can you hear me?

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:26.527
Who the devil are you?

01:08:34.643 --> 01:08:35.939
Oh God, no!

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:39.403
I wired you not to come here.
I warned you.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:41.380
But earlier tonight

01:08:42.885 --> 01:08:44.147
you said that we should join them.

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.076
Earlier tonight?

01:08:47.089 --> 01:08:48.613
What do you mean?
We've never spoken.

01:08:50.091 --> 01:08:51.059
But we...

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.562
Something's wrong. I don't feel well.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.098
I can't feel my legs.

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.933
Why are you looking at me like that?

01:09:03.072 --> 01:09:04.437
Henry, they've...

01:09:06.675 --> 01:09:08.165
Good god, no!!!

01:09:09.211 --> 01:09:10.439
I'm so sorry.

01:09:10.779 --> 01:09:11.768
They've really done it?

01:09:13.448 --> 01:09:15.144
My brain, my mind?

01:09:15.718 --> 01:09:16.707
Yes.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:18.911
What about my body?

01:09:19.587 --> 01:09:20.714
I... I don't know.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:24.484
He said they store them somewhere...

01:09:24.627 --> 01:09:28.426
Wilmarth, don't believe anything they've told you.

01:09:28.697 --> 01:09:30.528
They want to get to you, like they got to me.

01:09:30.599 --> 01:09:34.057
We know too much. Masterson
warned me not to interfere.

01:09:35.136 --> 01:09:37.002
They're going to do something terrible.

01:09:37.072 --> 01:09:38.038
What will they do?

01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.540
Masterson said they were "digging a tunnel".

01:09:40.809 --> 01:09:44.145
But I can't remember...
My God, Wilmarth, what have they done?!

01:09:44.145 --> 01:09:46.549
Digging a tunnel? What kind of tunnel? To where?

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.617
George! Why didn't I listen to him?

01:09:48.617 --> 01:09:50.812
Think, Akeley! Try to remember!

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.749
At least he's safely away from here!

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.658
Akeley! What tunnel?

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:59.025
Masterson warned me. My god,
Wilmarth, you never should have come here!

01:09:59.161 --> 01:10:01.959
Akeley, what tunnel? You've got to remember!

01:10:02.031 --> 01:10:03.555
You can't believe them!

01:10:12.141 --> 01:10:13.631
It's not a literal tunnel.

01:10:14.843 --> 01:10:15.969
They're going to open the spirit-door!

01:10:16.812 --> 01:10:17.779
What do you mean?

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:20.613
There's a legend, in the Davenport book.

01:10:22.017 --> 01:10:23.644
The Pennacook said the Outer Ones

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:28.724
will take sacred stones to make a
kind of a doorwayto their world.

01:10:28.724 --> 01:10:30.157
Maybe that's what he meant by a "tunnel"...

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.618
The black stone!

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.262
What?

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.861
The black stone that George brought to you.

01:10:37.199 --> 01:10:39.099
I found it in a ring of stones.

01:10:39.201 --> 01:10:43.137
It must be part of the door,
that's why they were so keen to get it back.

01:10:44.139 --> 01:10:46.073
Henry, George never brought me the stone.

01:10:46.909 --> 01:10:49.639
How can that be? I saw
him onto the train myself.

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.239
I put it in his hands.

01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:53.238
Yes, but he never...

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:56.713
My god, Henry, that was weeks ago.

01:10:57.553 --> 01:10:58.850
How long have you been like this?

01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:00.155
What?

01:11:00.322 --> 01:11:03.849
George never met me in Boston.
He never got off the train.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.787
Earlier tonight you said...

01:11:08.230 --> 01:11:10.221
that thing said that George...

01:11:13.202 --> 01:11:14.601
My god.

01:11:15.971 --> 01:11:17.063
It was a lie.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:19.933
Where is my son?

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.142
Henry, they wanted to get the
stone back. They must have...

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.680
No!

01:11:29.184 --> 01:11:30.151
I'm so sorry.

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:33.011
I sent him right into their hands!

01:11:36.358 --> 01:11:37.791
What have I done?

01:11:38.794 --> 01:11:41.888
Henry, listen to me. I overheard them,

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:45.225
they're going to try to open the doorway tonight.

01:11:46.602 --> 01:11:47.591
I have to go.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:50.830
Wilmarth! You can't leave me like this!

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.071
Put an end to it. I beg you.

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.135
Henry, I don't... I can't...

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.645
They took my son.

01:11:59.715 --> 01:12:00.716
They took my body.

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:03.879
In the name of all that's holy,
don't leave me like this.

01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:12.190
Thank you, Albert.

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.756
I can't live like this.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:17.890
Do it!

01:12:19.635 --> 01:12:21.125
Please!

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.637
Henry, I'm so sorry.

01:12:39.421 --> 01:12:40.615
You should have done it.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.824
You'd have been doing him a favour.

01:12:44.226 --> 01:12:45.284
I couldn't.

01:12:46.895 --> 01:12:47.862
Pity.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.127
Please put the gun down.
Look, I don't know anything.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.167
I'm not trying to stop them.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.301
You're too late.

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:55.694
Too late?

01:12:55.938 --> 01:12:58.406
To stop them, even if there was a way.

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:01.134
Akeley said you know what they're
trying to do, about the tunnel...

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.177
I said you're too late!

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:03.879
Can't stop 'em now.

01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:07.940
No, their tunnel, it's a spirit door...
a kind of passage...

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:11.315
I know. I know all about it.
I'm supposed to be there with them now to open it.

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:13.755
I couldn't go.

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.779
It's too late for all of us.

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.358
No, Akeley said if we...

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:20.889
They played Akeley perfectly.
He believed what they told him.

01:13:20.996 --> 01:13:24.432
They manipulated him. Fear,
greed, they know how to work us over.

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:29.071
No, the Davenport book,
it says the same things that Akeley...

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:30.834
Of course it does. Those things wrote the book!

01:13:30.939 --> 01:13:34.238
No, Davenport just collected folklore.
Legends from settlers and Indians.

01:13:34.376 --> 01:13:36.367
Who do you think told the Indians the legends?

01:13:36.478 --> 01:13:37.445
They did.

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:40.113
But this thing they're making,
it leads back to where they come from.

01:13:40.282 --> 01:13:42.716
No, no, no. It's not a door to lead there.

01:13:42.785 --> 01:13:44.218
Nobody's going to use it to go there.

01:13:45.154 --> 01:13:46.382
It's a door that leads here!

01:13:48.457 --> 01:13:49.458
Here?

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:51.085
Most of them can't fly through space.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.151
They make machinery to help
some others make the trip.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:54.695
Most of'em can never come here.

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:57.798
But once they have the tunnel,
their door, they'll come.

01:13:58.934 --> 01:14:02.426
They're coming now. Coming here.
Straight to Round Mountain.

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:04.162
More of them?

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.165
How many?

01:14:06.341 --> 01:14:07.740
How many stars are there?

01:14:09.011 --> 01:14:10.035
Oh my God!

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.108
So this tunnel,

01:14:16.018 --> 01:14:16.985
is it in their cave?

01:14:17.152 --> 01:14:18.915
No, no. It's on the mountain top.

01:14:19.354 --> 01:14:21.879
They got a ritual, a religious thing,

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:24.891
they have to do in front of the
standing stones up on Round Mountain.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:29.788
In the cave there's a staircase sort
of a thing that leads to the mountain top.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:31.065
What will they do?

01:14:31.166 --> 01:14:33.293
Noyes has to lead the Mi-Go in a ritual.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:37.863
I know it has to do with the series
of stones they brought from Yuggoth.

01:14:37.940 --> 01:14:39.202
He's probably already started.

01:14:39.508 --> 01:14:40.475
We have to stop him.

01:14:40.909 --> 01:14:42.467
We can't! Don't you get it?

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:45.045
There are things that cannot be stopped.

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:47.741
You can't stop him. You can't stop them.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.245
Mankind is done. They're what's next.

01:14:50.352 --> 01:14:51.979
No, no you're wrong.

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:55.748
Wrong? Wrong? Have you seen one? Up close?

01:14:56.091 --> 01:14:57.888
They can put thoughts right into your head.

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.520
We're no match for them.

01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:00.955
We can't just surrender.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:04.121
They won't let us surrender; we've already lost.

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:06.233
No, no there's got to be something we can do.

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:09.234
End it now. End it now.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.065
Don't give them the pleasure of destroying us.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:17.175
No, no, the book... there's a
passage in there about the spirit-door.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.947
It's in Davenport's notes...

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.414
That book? Lies!

01:15:20.549 --> 01:15:24.280
No, the Indians told
Davenport that only a high priest

01:15:24.386 --> 01:15:26.445
of our world can open the spirit-door to their world.

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:30.153
It has to be a shaman who goes
through first or it wont work.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.959
There's something about who goes through first...

01:15:33.595 --> 01:15:34.596
Here, let me show you...

01:15:34.596 --> 01:15:35.563
Leave it alone!

01:15:35.831 --> 01:15:38.901
Masterson, it's right there.
I think there is something we can do...

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:43.998
Don't open it. It's a trick, it's full of their lies.
The Mi-Go deceive us at every turn.

01:15:44.072 --> 01:15:45.130
Now hold on,

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:47.464
let me just show you...

01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:49.099
No!

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:51.409
It's all their lies!

01:15:52.014 --> 01:15:53.572
It's just what they want us to think.

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.176
Don't you see?
There's nothing we can do.

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.378
No, there is a way,

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.577
it's in the book!

01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:06.288
Here. Just let me show you.

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:08.863
No!

01:16:19.007 --> 01:16:20.099
Are you out of your mind?

01:16:24.313 --> 01:16:25.974
We can't stop them.

01:16:28.183 --> 01:16:29.275
They're coming.

01:16:30.452 --> 01:16:31.885
We're doomed.

01:16:34.222 --> 01:16:35.951
We're all doomed.

01:16:39.294 --> 01:16:41.057
Only one thing left...

01:16:43.165 --> 01:16:44.132
No!

01:17:26.608 --> 01:17:28.098
We have to go.

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:29.599
Somewhere safe.

01:17:30.512 --> 01:17:31.479
The barn.

01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.409
The barn... your barn?

01:18:19.394 --> 01:18:21.021
Sit down.

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.158
It's Hannah, isn't it?

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.407
You'll be all right Hannah.

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:49.989
Such a pretty name.

01:18:52.194 --> 01:18:55.561
My name is Albert.
It's not very pretty, is it?

01:19:01.703 --> 01:19:07.699
You know, I... had a little
girl of my own once. Years ago.

01:19:09.111 --> 01:19:11.079
She was just a bit younger than you are now.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:22.619
Right after the war...
a lot of people got terribly sick.

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:30.088
My Sonia got the sickness.
My wife, too. Both my girls.

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:36.201
The doctors couldn't help her-
so many people had the influenza...

01:19:37.672 --> 01:19:40.505
You know what I did when my
little girl didn't feel well?

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:45.470
I sang her a song and that made her feel better.

01:19:47.149 --> 01:19:48.707
Would you like me to sing that song for you?

01:19:52.521 --> 01:19:53.510
No.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:03.727
That's all right, Hannah.
That's all right.

01:20:08.804 --> 01:20:10.704
Now listen to me, Hannah.
There's something I have to do.

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:14.299
These things...

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.813
They've made a kind of a door

01:20:19.881 --> 01:20:22.179
to where they come from and
they're going to try to open it.

01:20:22.717 --> 01:20:26.551
Someone special, Mr. Noyes, I think,
is going to do that. If I can stop him...

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:29.714
No more of the things will come. It will all be over.

01:20:31.226 --> 01:20:34.457
But I have to go, right now.

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:40.299
I promise you, no matter what,
I will come back for you.

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:50.808
Hannah, I have to go. To keep us safe.
If I don't stop them...

01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.370
They'll come.

01:20:53.815 --> 01:20:55.646
They will.

01:20:58.186 --> 01:21:01.178
I have to go to Round Mountain.
There's a cave there.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.280
I can take you.

01:21:03.925 --> 01:21:08.225
No. No, it's too dangerous.
I have to go alone.

01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:09.755
I can help you.

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.531
You've already helped me, Hannah.

01:21:20.308 --> 01:21:24.176
If you follow the main path,
you'll get to where there's two stumps.

01:21:25.280 --> 01:21:29.239
If you go to the left, the path goes uphill,
right up by their cave.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.914
There's a big boulder in front of it.

01:21:34.256 --> 01:21:39.455
So, up the path to the two stumps,
to the left, to the boulder.

01:21:45.433 --> 01:21:46.900
You'll need this.

01:21:51.606 --> 01:21:52.937
I need to leave now.

01:21:54.876 --> 01:21:56.468
I know.

01:21:59.714 --> 01:22:00.942
You wait here for me.

01:22:01.449 --> 01:22:02.541
This place is safe.

01:22:03.218 --> 01:22:04.947
My daddy painted hexes over the door.

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:07.312
They can't come in here.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:10.357
Good girl, Hannah.

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:14.724
You stay here. I'll be
back for you, no matter what.

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.867
Thank you, Hannah, for helping me.

01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.496
Goodbye, Albert.

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:10.012
...for such a passage
provideth the Black Goat of the Woods.

01:28:19.894 --> 01:28:21.885
...and lo the seventh and final,

01:28:23.064 --> 01:28:28.593
carried from lightless Yuggoth
through the black seas of infinity,

01:28:28.770 --> 01:28:34.902
for it is the stone that carries the name
of its messenger Who Is Not to Be Named.

01:29:20.688 --> 01:29:23.316
And in the name of the Black Goat
of the Wood with a Thousand Young...

01:29:39.307 --> 01:29:45.303
For great has the journey to black
Yuggoth been, now it be conjoined,

01:29:45.847 --> 01:29:54.016
and thither shall mankind go to share in the
nameless and unspoken rites of Shub-Niggurath.

01:29:56.891 --> 01:29:59.689
Thus in the name of the
Name Which Must Not Be Spoken,

01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:06.059
do I this passage consecrate
with my person.

01:30:17.912 --> 01:30:21.939
Open shall the passage
be rendered in the

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:24.745
name of the Black Goat of the
Woods with a Thousand Young!

01:32:02.950 --> 01:32:05.817
Open the door, sweetheart!
It's me, it's Albert!

01:32:07.855 --> 01:32:09.015
Can you hear me?

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:13.390
Unlock the door sweetheart!
It's all right!

01:32:18.966 --> 01:32:20.558
Thank you, sweetheart.

01:32:25.072 --> 01:32:26.073
Are you all right?

01:32:26.073 --> 01:32:27.040
Yes.

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:29.440
Get in the airplane.
We're getting out of here.

01:32:30.011 --> 01:32:31.569
You couldn't stop them.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:42.523
Get in the plane.

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:52.093
You've flown in it before, haven't you?

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.188
Yes.

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:54.461
Do you know how to turn the magneto on?

01:32:54.869 --> 01:32:58.168
How to open the throttle?
Did your father ever show you any of that?

01:32:58.439 --> 01:32:59.406
Yes.

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:01.597
Good girl.

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:08.115
Open up the throttle, Hannah.
Don't touch any of the switches.

01:33:11.652 --> 01:33:13.415
No, the otherway.

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:16.321
You have to turn it the other way.

01:33:18.893 --> 01:33:20.451
Oh, right. Good girl.

01:33:26.968 --> 01:33:28.026
Oh god.

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:34.268
There is no need for you to suffer.
You can live forever among us.

01:33:36.077 --> 01:33:37.601
Turn on the magneto now, Hannah!

01:33:38.379 --> 01:33:39.403
Ignition on!

01:33:45.419 --> 01:33:48.320
Wilmarth. Come with us.

01:33:57.198 --> 01:33:58.324
Are you sure the magneto's on, honey?

01:33:58.466 --> 01:33:59.433
Yes.

01:34:00.301 --> 01:34:03.566
Wilmarth. You cannot escape us.

01:34:09.377 --> 01:34:10.969
Albert, can you hear them too?

01:34:31.399 --> 01:34:32.400
Are you ready?

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:33.401
Yes.

01:34:33.401 --> 01:34:34.698
Don't be afraid.

01:35:56.317 --> 01:35:57.306
It's coming!

01:35:57.418 --> 01:35:58.385
Hang on!

01:36:40.828 --> 01:36:43.464
I got him, Albert! I got him!

01:36:43.464 --> 01:36:44.453
Good girl!

01:37:23.838 --> 01:37:26.238
You cannot escape us.

01:37:41.155 --> 01:37:43.783
You cannot succeed.

01:38:13.354 --> 01:38:15.288
And that was all.

01:38:15.890 --> 01:38:18.859
You know the rest, of course,
betterthan I myself, I would dare to say.

01:38:39.513 --> 01:38:44.746
It all seems so normal and easy now.
I feel foolish when I think how I resisted it.

01:38:45.286 --> 01:38:49.382
The experience has been so far beyond
anything I could possibly have imagined.

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:52.723
I suppose I hardly need to explain that to you.

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:58.322
The Akeleys paid a price for their involvement,

01:38:58.432 --> 01:39:02.596
though it's hardly significant when
compared to the scope of the matters at hand.

01:39:04.004 --> 01:39:09.567
I now regret the harm I inflicted and
am so grateful that they hold no grudge.

01:39:11.845 --> 01:39:14.712
I'm so looking forward to
my first trip to the outside,

01:39:15.716 --> 01:39:17.946
to joining the ranks of those few privileged mortals

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:20.452
to share in the glory of their understanding.

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.957
I have been given a rich boon of knowledge

01:39:22.957 --> 01:39:26.449
and intellectual adventure which
few other men have ever shared.

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.605
Wilmarth? Are you in there?

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:42.875
It's me, Ward. Open up!

01:40:26.053 --> 01:40:28.886
And now, if you don't mind,
we might adjourn our session until tomorrow.

01:40:29.890 --> 01:40:35.419
When disconnected, I find I drop off into a
sleep of the most vivid, fantastic dreams.

01:40:36.697 --> 01:40:38.562
I've rather come to enjoy it.

01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:40.557
If you'd be so kind...

01:40:42.036 --> 01:40:43.003
Good night.
