WEBVTT

00:01.367 --> 00:05.471
So, again, your alibi is
a mysterious stranger

00:05.473 --> 00:08.207
handed you the gun,
made you put your prints on it,

00:08.209 --> 00:10.309
robbed the store,
and then hid the gun

00:10.311 --> 00:11.510
in your underpants.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.711
Well, yeah, if you say it
like that,

00:12.713 --> 00:14.113
it don't sound believable.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.447
Oh, hey, captain.

00:15.449 --> 00:17.016
Did you get my report
on the Finley murder?

00:17.018 --> 00:18.384
Yeah, I looked it over.
Nice work.

00:18.386 --> 00:22.254
Good. Thanks, dad.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.189
Why is everyone
staring at me?

00:24.191 --> 00:26.125
You just called
captain Holt "dad."

00:26.127 --> 00:29.028
What? No, I didn't.
I said, "thanks, man."

00:29.030 --> 00:30.729
Do you see me as
a father figure, Peralta?

00:30.731 --> 00:32.631
No. If anything, I see you

00:32.633 --> 00:33.732
as a "bother" figure,

00:33.734 --> 00:35.267
'cause you're always
bothering me.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.403
Hey, show your father
some respect.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.071
I didn't call him dad.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.639
<i>No, no, no, no, Jacob.</i>

00:40.641 --> 00:42.041
I take it as a compliment.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.677
I called Vivian "mom" once,
and she's my fiancee.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.246
Guys, jump on that!

00:47.248 --> 00:48.781
Boyle has
psycho-sexual issues.

00:48.783 --> 00:50.182
Old news.

00:50.184 --> 00:52.151
But you calling Holt "daddy"--

00:52.153 --> 00:54.286
hey, "daddy" is not
on the table here.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.355
But you did call him
"dad," dude.

00:56.357 --> 01:00.225
All right, all right,
I was lying about the holdup.

01:00.227 --> 01:01.727
But the dad thing,
that happened.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.429
Aha!

01:03.431 --> 01:04.763
He admitted that his alibi
was a lie.

01:04.765 --> 01:09.268
It was a trap, all part
of my crazy, devious plan.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.702
I believe you.
Thank you.

01:10.704 --> 01:12.271
Son.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.505
Do you want to talk
about it later

01:13.507 --> 01:16.575
over a game of catch?

01:16.577 --> 01:17.543
I'd like that.

01:19.000 --> 01:25.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:38.465 --> 01:40.299
<i>Thank you for coming in</i>
<i>on your day off.</i>

01:40.301 --> 01:41.433
I know you'd all rather be
at home,

01:41.435 --> 01:43.235
binge watching media content.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.304
Oh! I just started
the second season

01:45.306 --> 01:46.371
of media content.

01:46.373 --> 01:47.573
No spoilers.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.775
But these evaluations
are important.

01:49.777 --> 01:52.244
Sir, I think I speak
for all of us...

01:52.246 --> 01:53.445
She doesn't.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.481
When I say that we can't wait

01:55.483 --> 01:57.282
for you to sit
in judgment of us.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.818
Oh, these will be
self-evaluations, Santiago.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.321
Why...Se.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.323
Very wise, sir.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.324
Nice save.

02:05.326 --> 02:06.425
Also, please stay
out of the way

02:06.427 --> 02:07.659
of the weekend squad.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.128
They are on duty,
and the bullpen is theirs.

02:10.131 --> 02:12.164
I hate the weekend squad.

02:12.166 --> 02:13.699
Detective lohank
shaves at my desk

02:13.701 --> 02:14.867
and gets hair
all over my computer.

02:14.869 --> 02:16.735
My "r" key
is jammed with stubble.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.370
Well, that explains
the email you sent

02:18.372 --> 02:20.672
about the "guesome mude."

02:20.674 --> 02:22.341
Dismissed.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.510
<i>I'm pumped for these</i>
<i>evaluations, sir.</i>

02:24.512 --> 02:26.812
I can't wait to hear what you
have to say about my squad.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.547
<i>I think they've had</i>
<i>a great year.</i>

02:28.549 --> 02:30.482
I feel like
a proud mama hen

02:30.484 --> 02:32.684
whose baby chicks
have learned to fly.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.219
Interesting analogy,
sergeant.

02:34.221 --> 02:36.755
Chickens are famously bad
at flying.

02:36.757 --> 02:37.789
<i>Yo.</i>

02:37.791 --> 02:39.424
Peralta asked to be first,

02:39.426 --> 02:41.860
which shows how seriously
he's begun taking his job.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.462
Nope, I just want to get
this over with.

02:43.464 --> 02:44.796
So I have 72 arrests,

02:44.798 --> 02:47.232
an 80% clearance rate,

02:47.234 --> 02:49.535
but most importantly,

02:49.537 --> 02:51.303
I wore a tie sometimes.

02:51.305 --> 02:53.505
<i>Now, I have a question</i>
<i>for you:</i>

02:53.507 --> 02:55.941
Is there any way
I can borrow $430,000?

02:55.943 --> 02:57.943
Why on earth do you need
that much money?

02:57.945 --> 02:59.478
I need to buy my apartment.

02:59.480 --> 03:00.879
I've been living
at my Nana's place

03:00.881 --> 03:02.781
since she passed away
'cause it's rent-controlled,

03:02.783 --> 03:04.416
but now the building's
going co-op,

03:04.418 --> 03:05.751
so I have to buy it.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.554
I need to secure a loan
by the end of the day.

03:08.556 --> 03:10.622
Uh, so should we do
a wire transfer,

03:10.624 --> 03:11.890
or do you think cash
is easier?

03:11.892 --> 03:13.225
Let's just do cash.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.293
Shouldn't you be asking
somebody else

03:14.295 --> 03:15.427
for that kind of money?

03:15.429 --> 03:16.428
Like a bank?

03:16.430 --> 03:18.597
Yeah, I tried that.

03:24.370 --> 03:25.737
Jake, I cannot believe

03:25.739 --> 03:27.606
you're gonna lose
Nana's apartment.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.274
We grew up together.
We used to hang out there

03:29.276 --> 03:30.709
every day after school.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.545
That's right, because there was
no one to look after us,

03:33.547 --> 03:36.248
because our moms
both worked, and...

03:36.250 --> 03:38.383
We didn't have fathers

03:38.385 --> 03:42.221
Peralta, I will not give you
a cool half mil

03:42.223 --> 03:44.256
because you had
a slightly sad childhood.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.525
Go solve
your housing crisis.

03:46.527 --> 03:52.297
Nana made me the intelligent,
sensuous woman I am today.

03:52.299 --> 03:54.466
Weird way to describe
a grandma's influence on you.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.534
I'm sorry, Gina.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.002
I don't know
that we can spare you.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.238
Um, these are her notes
so far.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.340
"Empanadas, Atlantic city,
birth control."

04:01.342 --> 04:02.774
No, that's my travel journal.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.643
I haven't started
on the notes yet.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.578
You may go with Peralta.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.547
Both: Thank you.

04:08.549 --> 04:10.782
I want to take Vivian
somewhere romantic tonight.

04:10.784 --> 04:11.984
How about this?

04:11.986 --> 04:13.352
Graziolo's,

04:13.354 --> 04:15.554
for the <i>porco digestivo</i> meal.

04:15.556 --> 04:19.391
It's a culinary tour
of a pig's digestive track.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.993
Pig bung gelato for two,
anyone?

04:20.995 --> 04:22.527
<i>Uh-oh, heads up.</i>

04:22.529 --> 04:23.528
Weekend crew.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.735
<i>I feel sad for you.</i>

04:29.737 --> 04:31.270
<i>I love my desk buddy.</i>

04:31.272 --> 04:32.771
Sometimes detective kearns
and I leave presents

04:32.773 --> 04:35.374
for each other.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.643
Well, lohank's
a stubble monkey.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.478
I hate him
and his face garbage.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.380
<i>Why don't you just tell him</i>
<i>to stop shaving at his desk?</i>

04:41.382 --> 04:43.882
He denies even doing it.
I don't know why.

04:43.884 --> 04:45.284
Next time I catch him shaving,

04:45.286 --> 04:46.285
I'm gonna punch him
so hard in the mouth

04:46.287 --> 04:48.854
he bites his own heart.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.722
Could that be why
he denies doing it?

04:50.724 --> 04:53.759
Oh, yeah, you could be right.
Yeah.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.594
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

04:55.596 --> 04:58.730
It is always so crazy
coming back here.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.299
Remember when Nana got cable?

05:00.301 --> 05:03.402
We watched <i>house party 2</i>
<i>so many times.</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:05.504
It was a pajama-jamma-jam.
We had no choice.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.005
Our hands were tied.
I gotta say,

05:07.007 --> 05:09.041
I'm psyched to be hanging
like this, old-school stylez.

05:09.043 --> 05:10.475
"Stylez" with a "z".

05:10.477 --> 05:12.377
Oh, I could tell.

05:12.379 --> 05:13.945
Okay, well, maybe we can
figure out a way for you

05:13.947 --> 05:15.347
to afford this place.

05:15.349 --> 05:18.817
Hup, hup, before we get
all financial,

05:18.819 --> 05:21.520
can I interest you
in an ice-cold foh-dy?

05:21.522 --> 05:24.356
A'ight.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.325
So talk to me, goose.
How we lookin'?

05:26.327 --> 05:28.493
Sexy, but not like
we're trying too hard.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.594
Like, sure, we're trying,

05:29.596 --> 05:31.463
but it's almost effortless.

05:31.465 --> 05:32.497
Yeah, no,
I knew all of that.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.498
I meant the money thing.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.400
Oh. My first impression

05:35.402 --> 05:38.704
is that you have a debilitating
spending problem.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.406
Jake, you have
six massage chairs.

05:41.408 --> 05:42.908
Well, they don't make
a massage couch.

05:42.910 --> 05:45.711
Okay, but you also have
three turntables.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.347
Ooh, yeah!
I'm learning how to spin.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.815
<i>Check it out.</i>

05:53.120 --> 05:55.520
All I have are my grandma's
old klezmer records,

05:55.522 --> 05:56.955
and I still haven't
quite figured out

05:56.957 --> 05:59.024
how to sync up the beats,
but it's not bad, right?

05:59.026 --> 06:03.395
It sounds like joy behar
falling down some stairs.

06:03.397 --> 06:05.097
Okay, you also purchased

06:05.099 --> 06:08.800
<i>Olympus has fallen</i>
<i>on demand 12 times.</i>

06:08.802 --> 06:11.403
Was it a difficult movie
for you to follow?

06:11.405 --> 06:12.738
<i>No, just watched it a lot.</i>

06:12.740 --> 06:16.508
How much do I have to cut back
in order to keep this place?

06:16.510 --> 06:19.378
Infinity percent.

06:19.380 --> 06:21.713
Technically speaking,
you're bankrupt, kiddo.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.048
That sounds bad.

06:23.050 --> 06:26.685
I only said "kiddo"
to soften the blow, kiddo.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.723
This is so unfair.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.793
And then all of the sudden,
they decide they're going co-op

06:34.795 --> 06:35.761
with zero warning?

06:35.763 --> 06:36.928
It seems illegal

06:36.930 --> 06:38.663
they didn't tell you
this was happening.

06:38.665 --> 06:39.998
Well, it's possible
I missed a letter,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.032
but I doubt it.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.734
Ooh, let's check
the mail tub.

06:42.736 --> 06:43.902
Mail tub?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.404
Nope. No.

06:45.406 --> 06:46.738
No.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.441
See? It's impossible
to find anything in here.

06:49.443 --> 06:50.675
It's not my fault.

06:50.677 --> 06:51.877
This is actually
a cool little bathroom.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.645
Nice claw-foot tub.

06:53.647 --> 06:56.014
Which I will never throw
my mail into again.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.816
Unless...

06:57.818 --> 06:59.618
I didn't want to do this,
but I do know one way

06:59.620 --> 07:00.619
we could get the money.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.187
You'd make
a decent prostitute.

07:02.189 --> 07:04.022
I'd make an amazing prostitute.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.725
But I was actually talking
about this guy I know, Frank.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.694
He's kinda skeevy, but he will
loan money to anybody.

07:09.696 --> 07:11.163
So he's a loan shark.

07:11.165 --> 07:12.798
Maybe you're not
thinking this through.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.133
Says the woman who's been
engaged eight times.

07:15.135 --> 07:17.002
Uh, but never married once.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.804
Game, set, match--linetti.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.806
<i>Well, it's the only choice</i>
<i>i have.</i>

07:20.808 --> 07:22.908
So let's go.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.877
<i>Sir, I know we got off</i>
<i>to a weird start,</i>

07:25.879 --> 07:27.646
so to get things
back on track,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.915
I'd like to bring in
Santiago next.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.116
She's had a great year.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.551
You wanted
to see me, sirs?

07:32.553 --> 07:33.718
<i>I was reading</i>
<i>the sergeant's lips</i>

07:33.720 --> 07:34.820
through the window,
and he either said,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.655
"bring in Santiago next,"

07:36.657 --> 07:39.057
or something
about a San Diego nest.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.992
Are you ready
for your self-evaluation?

07:40.994 --> 07:43.628
I am.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.531
I understand from a lip-reading
session last week

07:46.533 --> 07:49.701
that you intend to ask us
each ten questions.

07:49.703 --> 07:54.940
But for you, I have
just one question.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.808
What is your biggest...

07:56.810 --> 07:59.244
Flaw?

07:59.246 --> 08:01.646
My biggest flaw?

08:01.648 --> 08:05.484
Working too hard?

08:05.486 --> 08:07.953
Being too thorough?

08:07.955 --> 08:11.089
Caring too much?

08:11.091 --> 08:12.491
Got it.

08:12.493 --> 08:14.626
Something entirely different.

08:16.729 --> 08:18.096
Rosa, look!

08:18.098 --> 08:19.498
Lohank is shaving
right now.

08:31.778 --> 08:37.282
Both, in slow-motion: Noooo!

08:37.284 --> 08:38.783
Boyle, call an ambulance.

08:38.784 --> 08:39.951
I'm gonna do
some stuff to him.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.787
Or we give him a taste
of his own medicine.

08:42.789 --> 08:43.922
We fill his locker
with shaving cream

08:43.924 --> 08:45.957
and loose hair.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.259
I like it.

08:47.261 --> 08:49.160
I cannot believe
I am considering

08:49.162 --> 08:50.695
a non-violent option.

08:50.697 --> 08:53.698
And I know just where to get
a bundle of loose hair.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.101
<i>How much interest</i>
<i>do you charge?</i>

08:56.103 --> 08:57.736
Look, I'm not a bank.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.004
It's my own personal money.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.306
So I take a larger vig.

09:01.308 --> 09:02.541
20 points.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.909
A "vig." So cool.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.577
Well, I don't need much.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.846
Just, like, $430,000.

09:07.848 --> 09:09.047
Nah, too much.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.817
I make small loans
to desperate losers.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.819
And friends, like you.

09:14.821 --> 09:16.187
Well, I'm happy
this went terribly.

09:16.189 --> 09:18.790
Uh, we do have to go now,
so please excuse us.

09:18.792 --> 09:21.259
Wait, I just need enough
to show the co-op board

09:21.261 --> 09:22.861
I can make a down payment
at the bank.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.563
How about $20,000?

09:24.565 --> 09:26.131
Two bags of ziti?

09:26.133 --> 09:27.699
That I can do.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.568
"Bags of ziti?"

09:29.570 --> 09:31.269
Come on, Gina,
how awesome is that?

09:31.271 --> 09:32.571
Get on board.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.573
Come on, Gina.
Get on board.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.741
Jake, he is a sea witch
in disguise.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.577
Do not sing into his shell.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.979
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.681
Oh, little mermaid.

09:42.683 --> 09:44.616
What have you done?

09:45.886 --> 09:47.319
Oh, yeah.

09:47.321 --> 09:48.853
Wow.

09:48.855 --> 09:51.056
Nothing gets you smiling
like cold-blooded vengeance.

09:52.859 --> 09:57.028
And now,
the piece de resistance.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.930
Emilio's giant bag of hair.

10:00.233 --> 10:03.068
Oh, this is disgusting.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.102
It's perfect.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.236
Ugh.
Ugh.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.106
Ooh, check--check this out.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.144
I'm tom Selleck.
Park my chopper on the beach.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.749
I'm a Billy goat.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.953
Oh!

10:21.955 --> 10:24.723
Oh, I think I swallowed
a bunch of stranger hair.

10:24.725 --> 10:25.924
Ugh!

10:25.926 --> 10:27.325
<i>Hey.</i>

10:27.327 --> 10:29.294
Mr. henders,
the king of the lobby.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.197
Jake, the co-op board meeting
was an hour ago.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.032
I know.
I am so sorry.

10:34.034 --> 10:37.068
It's just I've been pretty busy
with police work, you know,

10:37.070 --> 10:38.837
with my police friends,

10:38.839 --> 10:41.640
helping out non-police folk
such as yourself,

10:41.642 --> 10:43.642
keeping you safe police.

10:43.644 --> 10:44.643
We appreciate your service.

10:44.645 --> 10:47.712
Look, I know there's been
a lot of misconceptions

10:47.714 --> 10:49.047
about my financial situation,

10:49.049 --> 10:51.816
but I am ready to put that
to rest right now.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.652
Boom goes the dynamite.
Oh, my God.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.320
That's $20,000 right there,

10:55.322 --> 10:57.789
and I intend to use it
as a down payment on a mortgage.

10:57.791 --> 10:58.957
Where did you get this money?

10:58.959 --> 11:00.025
Just had it lying around.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.693
You've been
an adequate tenant.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.395
Adequate.
But we needed
a completed application

11:03.397 --> 11:04.963
with a bank loan by today.

11:04.965 --> 11:07.098
With all due respect, sir,
that's not fair.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.366
I mean, I didn't even know
that the building

11:08.368 --> 11:09.834
was going co-op
until last week.

11:09.836 --> 11:10.869
I got one letter.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.771
We left you 15 voicemails
as well.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.372
Ah, voicemails.
Well, that explains it.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.775
My generation mostly texts.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.410
I'm only 33, so--

11:18.412 --> 11:19.944
we're in the same generation.
I'm 31.

11:19.946 --> 11:21.346
31?
Mm-hmm.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.814
But I call you "mister."

11:22.816 --> 11:25.784
And you wear a suit, and...

11:25.786 --> 11:27.152
That.

11:27.154 --> 11:28.887
Did you just point
at my bald spot?

11:28.889 --> 11:30.155
No.
Look.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.823
We're putting the apartment
on the market.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.758
We need to get it ready
for brokers to show.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.360
We need you out
by next Friday.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.696
Ohhh, next Friday's
a little tough for me.

11:37.698 --> 11:39.097
Is there any way
we could move it

11:39.099 --> 11:41.366
to the Sunday after
eight years from next Friday?

11:42.935 --> 11:44.235
Based on your judge-y eyes,

11:44.237 --> 11:47.105
I am going to take back
my dynamite.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.873
Un-boom.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.910
You got a full head--
head of hair.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.845
Nope.
Okay.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.151
Aw, that bad?

12:00.153 --> 12:01.753
I'm gonna be homeless.

12:01.755 --> 12:03.188
A homeless cop.

12:03.190 --> 12:04.322
It's like a made-for-TV movie

12:04.324 --> 12:05.490
that I will not be able
to watch

12:05.492 --> 12:06.958
because I won't have
a television

12:06.960 --> 12:08.126
because I'll be homeless.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.828
Chin up, lil' pup.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.296
First of all, you could
watch it on your phone.

12:11.298 --> 12:14.432
Second, this isn't the only
apartment in the city.

12:14.434 --> 12:15.800
We'll find you a new one.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.969
You're right.

12:17.971 --> 12:19.204
You're right.
This could be good.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.872
I mean, maybe we'll find
a great place.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.907
Atta girl.
In a cooler neighborhood.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.008
That's right, girl.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.343
Maybe I'll even have
a cute neighbor.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.845
Get it, girl.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.113
You gotta stop
calling me girl.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.381
Sorry, girl.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.916
<i>Okay, sirs.</i>

12:31.918 --> 12:34.385
I know why you weren't happy
with my self-evaluation.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.754
You didn't want me
to say a flaw

12:35.756 --> 12:37.155
that was actually positive,

12:37.157 --> 12:38.990
like how the sergeant
always says it's bad

12:38.992 --> 12:40.325
that he works out too much.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.227
Whoa. Why the drive-by?

12:42.229 --> 12:43.228
Sorry.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.929
But that's not right,

12:44.931 --> 12:48.466
because you value honesty
and humility above all else.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.368
So what's your biggest flaw?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.203
My biggest flaw.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.038
I'm too competitive,
prone to jealousy,

12:54.040 --> 12:55.507
"bit of a killjoy,

12:55.509 --> 12:56.908
"follow rules to a fault,

12:56.910 --> 13:02.213
and every now and then,
I smoke a cigarette."

13:02.215 --> 13:03.548
Is that what
you're looking for?

13:03.550 --> 13:05.216
Because I can keep going.

13:05.218 --> 13:06.317
I am deeply flawed.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.453
Santiago--
oh, no.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.221
"Santiago" in "b" flat.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.122
You're disappointed.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.791
Okay, well,

13:12.793 --> 13:14.526
I'm going to go
to a secret location

13:14.528 --> 13:16.094
and make sure that nobody
is smoking there.

13:16.096 --> 13:17.495
I'll be right back.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.231
<i>Is this a pre-war?</i>

13:20.233 --> 13:21.399
Ah, very good eye.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.401
And you should know
it's also pet-friendly.

13:23.403 --> 13:26.204
Really?
Do they allow cats?

13:26.206 --> 13:28.239
I can't tell if you're
being sarcastic.

13:28.241 --> 13:33.812
How would you even
get a bed in here?

13:33.814 --> 13:35.980
Oh, Murphy bed.

13:35.982 --> 13:36.981
Voila.

13:36.983 --> 13:38.183
Nope.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.884
This is kinda cool.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.486
<i>High ceilings,</i>
<i>so many windows.</i>

13:41.488 --> 13:43.087
Gina, the toilet is

13:43.089 --> 13:45.924
in the middle
of the living room.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.091
I think it's sexy.

13:48.461 --> 13:50.829
Aah!

13:50.831 --> 13:52.230
<i>So when's this going down?</i>

13:52.232 --> 13:53.898
Well, normally, Lohan hits
the locker room

13:53.900 --> 13:55.166
when he goes to the gym,

13:55.168 --> 13:57.969
so let's see when he plans
on working out.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.571
So, Lohan,
I was reading an article

13:59.573 --> 14:01.239
about the benefits
of exercise--

14:01.241 --> 14:02.540
you going to the gym today?

14:02.542 --> 14:04.142
Not today. Been spending
all my breaks on the phone

14:04.144 --> 14:05.977
<i>with my wife, Nancy.</i>

14:05.979 --> 14:07.579
We've been having
marital problems.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.147
Right, 'cause of your hygiene?

14:09.149 --> 14:12.016
What? No, I wish.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.918
No, about a year ago,
she fell down the stairs

14:13.920 --> 14:15.220
and broke her back.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.956
Now she's addicted
to painkillers.

14:17.958 --> 14:19.290
We've been fighting a lot.
Mm.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.559
'Cause I want to help her,
you know?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.229
I guess I just love her
so much.

14:24.231 --> 14:25.897
But she's refusing treatment.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.165
Ohhh.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.366
We got into it again
last night.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.602
I went out
for some fresh air,

14:30.604 --> 14:32.203
but I forgot
to close the door,

14:32.205 --> 14:33.605
and our dog cinnamon
got out.

14:33.607 --> 14:34.973
Oh, no.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.075
Cinnamon got hit
by a drunk driver.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.309
<i>I wish I could say</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:40.111
she was put out of her misery
instantly,

14:40.113 --> 14:42.380
but the vet assured us
that her suffering

14:42.382 --> 14:45.183
was unending and terrible.

14:45.185 --> 14:48.186
Just venting a little.
I-I appreciate--

14:48.188 --> 14:50.355
of course.

14:50.357 --> 14:51.956
Anything for a good friend
like you.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.291
Charles, can I see you
for a minute?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.893
Yep.

14:54.895 --> 14:56.527
My first question is,

14:56.529 --> 15:00.131
why are the two of you doing
this self-evaluation together?

15:00.133 --> 15:02.233
Scully doesn't handle
pressure well.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.135
Um...

15:04.137 --> 15:05.336
Um...
Not to brag,

15:05.338 --> 15:07.205
but Scully and I have
a combined total

15:07.207 --> 15:10.308
of 14 arrests.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.277
Would've been 20,
but we only got 14.

15:12.279 --> 15:13.344
That's not enough arrests.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.246
Well, no one asked you.

15:15.248 --> 15:16.514
It's a self-evaluation.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.617
<i>Come on, Scully.</i>

15:22.321 --> 15:23.588
I'm trying to hurry,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.223
but when you grab the hair,
it breaks apart.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.558
The key is you use your hands
like scoopers.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.527
Just go--

15:29.529 --> 15:34.399
I'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for this, sir.

15:34.401 --> 15:37.268
Uh, we accidentally dropped
all our loose hair

15:37.270 --> 15:38.469
and shaving cream
in this locker,

15:38.471 --> 15:39.637
so we're cleaning it out.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.439
Hasn't detective Lohan
been through enough?

15:41.441 --> 15:44.075
He just got diagnosed
with prostate cancer.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.076
Course he did.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.211
Clean this up. Now.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.315
Yes, sir.

15:52.418 --> 15:54.085
What's wrong with you guys?

15:54.087 --> 15:56.955
I've lost control
of my squad.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.423
<i>Should we turn some lights on?</i>

15:58.425 --> 16:00.191
Trying to save
electricity, Gina.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.093
Your massage chair is on.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.295
Yeah, I'm poor.
I'm not a savage.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.997
Man, what am I gonna do?

16:05.999 --> 16:07.966
Well, what if I bought
the apartment?

16:07.968 --> 16:09.200
What are you talking about?

16:09.202 --> 16:11.169
And then I could rent it
to you till you find

16:11.171 --> 16:12.236
a new place.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.305
How could you afford
this place?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.573
Have you been
dealing drugs?

16:15.575 --> 16:17.241
No, I'm thrifty.

16:17.243 --> 16:19.344
I cut my own hair.
I walk to work.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.079
I eat Scully's lunch
every day.

16:21.081 --> 16:24.248
I've rented the same
crap box since I was 20

16:24.250 --> 16:25.616
'cause it's so cheap.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.085
I've saved up money,

16:27.087 --> 16:29.120
and I'm looking for
a real estate opportunity.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.222
Ew. A real estate
opportunity?

16:31.224 --> 16:32.490
Are you being serious?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.192
We were drinking 40's
this morning.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.094
I'm saying I could
give you a fair rent

16:36.096 --> 16:37.562
because I would be
your landlady.

16:37.564 --> 16:40.231
Whoa, whoa,
you be my landlady?

16:40.233 --> 16:41.099
<i>You're Gina.</i>

16:41.101 --> 16:42.166
Your lifelong dream

16:42.168 --> 16:43.434
is to be on <i>wife swap.</i>

16:43.436 --> 16:45.136
You call gum "the dentist."

16:45.138 --> 16:47.071
You think ray j
is a national treasure.

16:47.073 --> 16:49.173
Yeah, so what?
I'm eclectic.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.476
You're not better
than me, okay?

16:51.478 --> 16:53.544
And I'm glad
that I still own this place

16:53.546 --> 16:56.214
because I can happily
invite you to leave.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.649
Grow up, Jake.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.151
"Grow up, Jake."

17:00.153 --> 17:01.152
Oh, my goodness.

17:01.154 --> 17:03.388
Yeah, thanks for your help.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.189
Old-school styles.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.025
I take back the "z"!

17:11.164 --> 17:12.163
Whoa, you okay?

17:12.165 --> 17:13.263
Yep.

17:13.266 --> 17:16.534
Just checking out
my new bedroom.

17:16.536 --> 17:17.468
Oh, good.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.803
It feels like scoliosis

17:18.805 --> 17:20.738
and smells like
10 million butts.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.740
I take it your apartment thing
didn't work out.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.709
When did everyone decide
to become an adult?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.344
I mean, I know you were born
in your fifties,

17:26.346 --> 17:27.345
but come on.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.346
Thanks?

17:28.348 --> 17:29.580
Get this.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.282
Gina just offered
to buy Nana's apartment

17:31.284 --> 17:32.817
as a real estate opportunity

17:32.819 --> 17:34.485
and become my "landlady."

17:34.487 --> 17:35.653
Jake--
I know.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.188
She was just trying
to help,

17:37.190 --> 17:38.356
but we've known each other
since we were kids,

17:38.358 --> 17:39.357
you know?

17:39.359 --> 17:42.660
Which an ice cream cone
could do, by the way.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.695
And now I find out she's been
saving all these years?

17:44.697 --> 17:46.431
Jake--
I know.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.732
The person that I'm
really mad at is myself

17:47.734 --> 17:49.767
for screwing
this whole thing up.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.403
I gotta talk to Gina.
Thanks for your help, Amy.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.471
Didn't say anything,
don't want credit

17:53.473 --> 17:56.441
yeah, that's smart,
given my track record.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.242
Hey, wait.

17:58.244 --> 18:00.478
What would you say Holt
thinks my biggest flaw is?

18:00.480 --> 18:01.546
Who care what Holt thinks?

18:01.548 --> 18:03.247
What's most important

18:03.249 --> 18:05.083
is what I think
your biggest flaw is.

18:05.085 --> 18:06.551
And there are so many
to choose from--

18:06.553 --> 18:08.820
too competitive,
prone to jealousy,

18:08.822 --> 18:10.288
bit of a killjoy,

18:10.290 --> 18:11.622
your shame cigarettes.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.659
Oh, my God.
But your biggest flaw is...

18:14.661 --> 18:16.694
You suck at throwing away
your secret lists.

18:20.200 --> 18:23.801
Although I'm pretty sure
I caught some form of face lice

18:23.803 --> 18:25.103
from that bag of hair.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.571
Being a cop is dangerous.

18:26.573 --> 18:30.241
Yeah, it was fun.
Hey, you wanna grab a drink?

18:30.243 --> 18:31.542
Oh, shoot, I would,
but I'm meeting Vivian

18:31.544 --> 18:33.177
for that romantic
pig colon dinner.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.812
Hey, rosa.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.347
I want to apologize.

18:36.349 --> 18:37.748
I haven't been much fun
to hang out with

18:37.750 --> 18:38.850
over the last year or so

18:38.852 --> 18:40.651
on account of all
the asking you out

18:40.653 --> 18:43.521
and staring at you
from point-blank range.

18:43.523 --> 18:45.623
Yeah, you were a real weirdo.
Mm-hmm.

18:45.625 --> 18:46.791
But you're pretty cool

18:46.793 --> 18:48.593
now that you're in love
with someone else.

18:48.595 --> 18:49.494
Have a nice dinner.

18:49.496 --> 18:51.162
Oh, we will.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.563
They make a sorbet
out of the tail.

18:52.565 --> 18:55.600
See ya.

18:55.602 --> 18:58.569
Excuse me, captain.

18:58.571 --> 18:59.570
What are you doing, sergeant?

18:59.572 --> 19:01.172
I'm going to yell at you,

19:01.174 --> 19:02.907
and I don't want Santiago
to read my lips.

19:02.909 --> 19:03.908
Excuse me?

19:03.910 --> 19:06.244
You were completely unfair

19:06.246 --> 19:07.245
to my squad today.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.379
Santiago is one

19:08.381 --> 19:09.914
of your best detectives.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.251
And all you wanted to do was
play mind games with her.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.586
Scully and Hitchcock
only arrested 14 people,

19:15.588 --> 19:17.388
but that's 8 more
than last year.

19:17.390 --> 19:19.223
They only arrested
6 people last year?

19:19.225 --> 19:20.691
And I know Peralta
can be childish,

19:20.693 --> 19:22.660
but he leads the precinct
in collars,

19:22.662 --> 19:25.163
and he's grown up a heck
of a lot since you got here.

19:25.165 --> 19:26.664
Okay, sit down, sergeant.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.799
I'm going to do
your evaluation now.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.172
Sergeant Jeffords,

19:34.174 --> 19:35.339
you're right.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.508
I have been hard
on the squad.

19:37.510 --> 19:40.411
And just the fact
that you're willing

19:40.413 --> 19:42.547
to stand up for them
is one of the reasons

19:42.549 --> 19:43.814
they respect you so much.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.284
I could learn something
from you.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.554
You have every right
to feel like, um,

19:49.556 --> 19:51.389
um, what was it
you said this morning?

19:51.391 --> 19:52.657
Proud mama hen, sir.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.492
A proud...

19:54.494 --> 19:57.662
Mama hen.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.200
What do you want, Jake?

20:02.202 --> 20:03.634
I'm watching Oprah's
legends ball,

20:03.636 --> 20:05.503
which is what I do
every time a close friend

20:05.505 --> 20:06.704
hurts my feelings.

20:06.706 --> 20:10.408
I came here to apologize.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.376
Look, I was mad at you

20:12.378 --> 20:14.378
for being more together than me,
and that's not fair.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.546
I felt stupid,
so I acted out.

20:15.548 --> 20:16.581
I'm sorry.

20:16.583 --> 20:18.282
Yeah, you were stupid,

20:18.284 --> 20:20.318
and you should be sorry, Jake.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.587
But watching Oprah
have brunch

20:22.589 --> 20:25.323
with her strong woman friends

20:25.325 --> 20:27.258
has taught me that
it's okay to forgive.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.392
Great.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.894
Also, you should buy
Nana's place.

20:29.896 --> 20:30.995
Not for me.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.563
You should live there.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.298
You love that apartment,
and you said so yourself.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.333
It's a great investment.

20:35.335 --> 20:36.434
Where are you gonna live?

20:36.436 --> 20:37.668
Here.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.636
I'll sublet from you.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.971
I actually ran the numbers.

20:39.973 --> 20:41.505
I'd keep paying
the same amount of rent,

20:41.507 --> 20:42.873
and you would turn
a small profit.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.575
It's a starter apartment,
and it's my fault

20:44.577 --> 20:46.577
for starting when I'm 33.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.714
You have a deal.
All right.

20:49.716 --> 20:50.982
Shake, shake.

20:50.984 --> 20:52.617
Yes!

20:53.620 --> 20:54.685
Hello, detective.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.720
<i>Is there a reason</i>

20:55.722 --> 20:57.622
you're interrupting me
mid-soup?

20:57.624 --> 20:58.623
Yes.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.726
I'm ready for my
self-evaluation.

21:01.728 --> 21:02.827
So I asked Peralta

21:02.829 --> 21:04.528
what you thought
my biggest flaw was,

21:04.530 --> 21:07.732
and he said, "who cares
what Holt thinks?"

21:07.734 --> 21:08.733
That's not surprising.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.568
He's very disrespectful.

21:10.570 --> 21:13.504
My biggest flaw
is that I care too much

21:13.506 --> 21:14.839
what you think of me.

21:14.841 --> 21:16.874
I should be more confident
in my own judgment,

21:16.876 --> 21:19.343
and I am so sure of that,

21:19.345 --> 21:20.711
I don't even care
if you think I'm right.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.747
Evaluation over.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.516
Enjoy your soup.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.658
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
