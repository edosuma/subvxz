Well, it was a pleasure
traveling with you, Mr. Smith.

00:20.292 --> 00:21.750
It's not everyday you meet a man

00:21.833 --> 00:23.750
with such an interesting
calling.

00:23.833 --> 00:25.375

Red 6, this is Garibaldi.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.833
I know. I saw all your fights.

Man, you were something!

you were on your way

01:33.500 --> 01:34.833
You believe
what they said about me?

No. But I'd still like
to hear it from you.

It's a long story
and a wet one.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.125
I need to get a berth

01:41.542 --> 01:42.583
I'd say we'd hook up

02:03.083 --> 02:04.417
The Babylon Project

02:04.500 --> 02:06.542

02:06.625 --> 02:08.583
Its goal,
to prevent another war

02:08.667 --> 02:11.208

02:11.292 --> 02:13.875

Nothing but. Gave up
the rocket fuel a while ago.

04:06.875 --> 04:08.417
Oh, right. You always
were a lousy drunk.

04:08.500 --> 04:10.458
Me? As I recall
our first meeting

04:10.542 --> 04:12.208
you were about nine sheets
to the wind and taking apart

04:12.292 --> 04:13.667
a holeopeep in Fortune City.

04:13.750 --> 04:16.167

over my brainpan.

04:16.250 --> 04:17.542

04:17.625 --> 04:18.875

04:52.875 --> 04:54.833
You used to call me
Uncle Yossel.

04:57.708 --> 04:59.083
I can't believe you're here.

04:59.167 --> 05:00.875
Neither can I.

05:00.958 --> 05:03.333
This is my first time
among the stars, you know.

05:03.417 --> 05:07.500
Such vastness seen so close
makes one feel very small.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.750
You must be tired.
Please, sit down.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.875
- Can I get you anything?
- No. The seat, I'll take.

05:18.042 --> 05:20.208
- You're here about papa.
- Yes.

after his funeral

05:34.125 --> 05:35.583
but you weren't there.

05:35.667 --> 05:38.250
The station was in a crisis
at that time.

05:38.333 --> 05:39.667
I couldn't get away.

05:39.750 --> 05:41.750
Of course,
you're a military officer

05:41.833 --> 05:43.375
in an important position.

05:43.458 --> 05:45.250
Duty must come first.

05:46.417 --> 05:47.958
I understand

05:48.042 --> 05:49.542
and so would Andrei.

05:50.542 --> 05:52.292
'It's the way he raised you.'

05:53.500 --> 05:55.958
So...you sat Shiva here?

05:57.458 --> 06:00.917
- I haven't sat Shiva.
- It can still be done.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.167
I'll sit with you.
I'll arrange everything.

06:03.250 --> 06:05.250
I'm afraid I can't.

06:05.333 --> 06:06.750
My duties here
are very extensive.

06:06.833 --> 06:08.917
I just don't have the time.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.875
Besides,
it's been several months.

06:11.958 --> 06:14.000
There's no point.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.667
I see.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.458
Well, I think
I'll get some rest.

06:18.542 --> 06:21.000
I'm staying over
in the sanctuary area

06:21.083 --> 06:23.375

06:23.458 --> 06:25.292

06:25.375 --> 06:28.750
No, no, no, no. I'll find my own
way back. You have duties.

06:28.833 --> 06:31.458
But, uh, you will have dinner
with me tonight.

06:31.542 --> 06:34.958
Of course.
I'll come by at 20:00.

06:35.042 --> 06:36.792
- Huh?
- 8 o'clock.

06:38.375 --> 06:40.875
Blue 3. 20:00.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.583

06:46.792 --> 06:49.667

06:49.750 --> 06:51.667

(Walker Smith)
'So, after I beat Atagi'

07:01.667 --> 07:03.625
I was the number one
contender for the Title.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.417
That's when it came down.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.750
SportCorp had invested
abundantly in Vizaro.

07:08.833 --> 07:10.375
They were not about
to let him be beat.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.833
So, they told me
it wasn't my time yet.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.375
They said they would make it
worth my while

07:14.458 --> 07:16.167
to retire for a few years.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.125
So you told them to stuff it?

07:18.208 --> 07:19.750
And I wasn't that polite
about it.

07:19.833 --> 07:21.542
I worked long and hard
for that type of shot.

07:21.625 --> 07:23.875
And I didn't think there was
anything they could do.

07:23.958 --> 07:25.417
That's when they framed you?

07:25.500 --> 07:26.542
Like a picture.

07:26.625 --> 07:27.792
Doctored my blood test

07:27.875 --> 07:30.167
to make it look like
I was popping adrenals.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.667
Spread the word that
I was a stooge for the Syndi.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.000
The Nets ate it up
and me along with it.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.833
I haven't been able to get
a legitimate fight

07:36.917 --> 07:38.208
in two years.

07:38.292 --> 07:39.833
I earned that shot, Mike.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.625
I sweated for it, I bled for it

07:41.708 --> 07:43.042
I dreamed of it.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.375
They took it away from me
like it was nothing.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.083
Like I was nothing.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.917
So why did you come
to Babylon 5?

07:50.000 --> 07:52.333
To make history.

07:52.417 --> 07:54.708
To be the first human
to fight in the Mutai.

07:54.792 --> 07:56.458
Mutai? Are you
out of your skull?

07:56.542 --> 07:58.625
You know that Mutai means
"Trial of Blood."

07:58.708 --> 08:01.875
[laughs]
Snappy. They called my fight
with Atagi "World War IV."

08:01.958 --> 08:03.375
No, no, no. You don't get it.

08:03.458 --> 08:06.333
The Mutai isn't a prizefight,
it's a meat grinder.

08:06.417 --> 08:08.292
No rounds, no rules, no gloves.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.833
Just take your opponent out.

08:09.917 --> 08:11.292
Five aliens have been killed
in there.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.208
And ten times that number
have been crippled.

08:13.292 --> 08:15.167
I was dead when they took
my title shot away.

08:15.250 --> 08:17.583
So, I figure, I come up here
bust a few snakehead

08:17.667 --> 08:19.042
make a big splash in the Nets

08:19.125 --> 08:21.333
the Corp will be begging me
to fight the champ.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.333
It's the real deal, Mike.

08:27.375 --> 08:29.000
[intense music]

08:29.083 --> 08:31.417
I am Rabbi Yossel Koslov.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.125
What can I do for you, rabbi?

08:33.208 --> 08:35.917
I'm an old friend
of the Ivanov family.

08:36.000 --> 08:38.500
And I wish to speak
to you about Susan.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.292
Please, have a seat.

08:44.333 --> 08:47.875
You are aware of the recent
death of Susan's father?

08:47.958 --> 08:50.375
No. When did this happen?

08:50.458 --> 08:52.583
A few months ago.

08:52.667 --> 08:55.833
He was very ill.
It was not unexpected.

08:55.917 --> 08:57.750
I understand
she was speaking to him

08:57.833 --> 09:00.250
from here the moment he died.

09:00.333 --> 09:02.208
She never said
anything about it.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.167
[laughs]
I'm not surprised.

09:05.250 --> 09:09.542
Susan has always been very
private about such matters.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.375
And there was bad blood
between them.

09:12.458 --> 09:14.167
You know about her mother?

09:14.250 --> 09:17.500
I know she was a telepath
and that she took her own life.

09:17.583 --> 09:19.292
A great tragedy.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.708
And one for which I believe

09:20.792 --> 09:23.208
Susan always blamed her father.

09:23.292 --> 09:24.917
A year later, when her brother

09:25.000 --> 09:27.875
Ganya, was killed
in the Minbari Wars

09:27.958 --> 09:29.417
and Susan chose to join

09:29.500 --> 09:31.917
Earth force against
Andrei's wishes..

09:33.208 --> 09:36.208
...the rift between them
became greater still.

09:37.458 --> 09:39.000
I see.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.625
Susan has traveled
a hard road, commander.

09:41.708 --> 09:45.292
Now that her family is gone
that road is harder still.

09:46.250 --> 09:47.792
I'm worried about her.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.083
How can I help?

09:50.167 --> 09:52.708
It is Jewish tradition
to mourn the dead

09:52.792 --> 09:55.875
by sitting Shiva
so that family, friends

09:55.958 --> 09:58.000
members of the Jewish community

09:58.083 --> 10:00.667
can gather at the home
of the bereaved

10:00.750 --> 10:04.458
to offer comfort
and also help fulfill

10:04.542 --> 10:07.375
the obligation of prayer
for the departed.

10:07.458 --> 10:09.833
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

10:09.917 --> 10:14.167
Well..
Susan has not done this.

10:14.250 --> 10:17.875
And I believe it would help her
accept her father's death..

10:19.083 --> 10:21.500
...and his life.

10:21.583 --> 10:25.667
Now, if you could possibly
grant her a few days' leave.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.625
Certainly, she can take
as much time as she needs.

10:30.167 --> 10:31.417
Thank you, commander.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.917
I will tell Susan
at dinner tonight.

10:37.042 --> 10:38.917
By the way..

10:39.000 --> 10:41.625
'...this Babylon 5 of yours!'

10:41.708 --> 10:43.125
Phew!

10:43.208 --> 10:44.708
Ness gadol.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.792
A great miracle.

10:46.875 --> 10:48.375

11:15.500 --> 11:17.833
Treel?
It's kosher?

11:17.917 --> 11:19.125
[laughs]

11:19.208 --> 11:21.375
That, I can't say.

11:21.458 --> 11:24.500
Oh! I don't recall
Treel being mentioned

11:24.583 --> 11:26.625
in the Torah, so..

11:32.500 --> 11:35.250
Mmm. It's wonderful.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.625
So how are things back home?

11:37.708 --> 11:40.292
They change,
they stay the same.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.167
Russia is Russia.

11:42.250 --> 11:46.292
Your father used to say,
"If regret could be harvested

11:46.375 --> 11:49.375
Russia would be the world's
fruit basket."

11:49.458 --> 11:51.083
I remember.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.583
You know..

11:55.667 --> 11:57.833
...he would have
liked this place.

11:59.167 --> 12:02.000
I invited him,
but he always refused.

12:02.083 --> 12:04.125
He said humanity
had no business in space

12:04.208 --> 12:06.500
until we could learn to live
in peace on Earth.

12:07.833 --> 12:09.792
And you know how he felt
about Earth force.

12:09.875 --> 12:14.167
I know. But he didn't mean
Suzotchka.

12:14.250 --> 12:17.958
It was just that he was so
terribly afraid of losing you

12:18.042 --> 12:21.167
as he lost Sofie and Ganya.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.375
He lost me long before that.

12:26.333 --> 12:28.833
Is that why you won't sit Shiva?

12:30.875 --> 12:32.708
No. I told you
my duties won't allow it.

12:32.792 --> 12:35.375
We've got three trade convoys
due by Saturday and--

12:35.458 --> 12:39.250
Commander Sinclair
seems to think he can handle it.

12:39.333 --> 12:43.042
And he said you could have
as much time as you need.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.250
You spoke to the commander
about this?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.542
Yes. A fine man.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.958
You should not have done that.

12:51.042 --> 12:52.333
I'm a rabbi.

12:52.417 --> 12:54.000
When I see a Jew denying

12:54.083 --> 12:56.083
one of our most basic traditions

12:56.167 --> 12:57.333
I meddle.

12:57.417 --> 12:59.083
My father always
tried to control my life

12:59.167 --> 13:01.375
when he was alive I don't need
anyone to take his place

13:01.458 --> 13:03.167
now that he's gone.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.625
Please, excuse me.

13:05.833 --> 13:08.375
please, I didn't..

13:09.583 --> 13:11.833
[instrumental music]

13:26.125 --> 13:28.875
[grunting]

13:36.958 --> 13:39.500
You know, you are demented.
You can still call this off.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.083
Relax, all I have to do is find

13:41.167 --> 13:44.708
this Muta-Do character
who runs the show and I'm in.

13:44.792 --> 13:47.875
This place is only for Mutari.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.542
- Go.
- Relax, E.T.

13:49.625 --> 13:51.167
I'm looking for the Muta-Do.

13:51.250 --> 13:53.333
I'm Walker Smith from Earth.

13:53.417 --> 13:56.167
I'm here to fight in the Mutai.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.500
Humans..

13:57.583 --> 13:59.833
...do not fight in the Mutai.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.583
Go back to Earth..

14:02.667 --> 14:04.292
...Walker Smith.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.958
Who the hell are you?

14:07.042 --> 14:08.208
[grunting]

14:08.292 --> 14:09.750
[intense music]

14:11.708 --> 14:13.417
I am the Muta-Do.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.542
The Sayer.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.583
And I say..

14:17.667 --> 14:19.417
...go back to Earth.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.708
The Mutai..

14:23.792 --> 14:26.167
...is not for you.

14:26.250 --> 14:27.958
You heard him, Earthling.

14:28.042 --> 14:30.958
You've worn out
your welcome, ace.

14:31.042 --> 14:32.667
Come on.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.667
[grunting]

14:39.542 --> 14:42.083
Damn snakehead
caught me by surprise.

14:42.167 --> 14:44.250
That snakehead
is over 90 years old

14:44.333 --> 14:45.792
and fought in over 1000 Mutai.

14:45.875 --> 14:47.417
You knew who he was
all the time?

14:47.500 --> 14:49.000
Hey, look. Look, you wanna
get your head handed to you

14:49.083 --> 14:51.000
and I think it's a lousy idea.
So, sue me.

14:51.083 --> 14:53.417
But I had nothing to do with
what went down with Muta-Do.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.917
You did that
all by yourself.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.833
'These aliens may be
just snakeheads to you'

14:57.917 --> 14:59.292
But the Mutai means
something to them.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.375
You treat it like a tank fight.
Oh, come on, man.

15:01.458 --> 15:03.583
- Don't be like that.
- Stroke off.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.042
- Earther.
- Who in the hell are you?

15:17.208 --> 15:18.833
I am Caliban.

15:19.917 --> 15:21.875
You wish to fight in the Mutai?

15:21.958 --> 15:24.375
What if I do?
I've already been turned down.

15:24.458 --> 15:25.917
There is another way.

15:26.917 --> 15:29.125
But it must be done properly.

15:29.208 --> 15:30.833
With respect.

15:30.917 --> 15:34.250
And it will require
great courage.

15:35.625 --> 15:37.042
Keep talking.

15:46.292 --> 15:48.750
You wish to see me, commander?

15:48.833 --> 15:50.833
Yes.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.792
I wanted to offer my condolences
on the death of your father.

15:55.250 --> 15:56.667
Thank you.

15:56.750 --> 16:00.125
Why didn't you request leave
to attend the funeral?

16:00.208 --> 16:03.208
You were negotiating the
Euphrates Treaty at the time.

16:03.292 --> 16:05.375
I was needed here.

16:05.458 --> 16:08.000
That's commendable,
but since B-5 is quiet now

16:08.083 --> 16:09.583
I'm granting you
indefinite leave

16:09.667 --> 16:11.583
to sit Shiva for your father.

16:13.958 --> 16:16.208
That won't be necessary.

16:16.292 --> 16:17.750
May I return to my post?

16:17.833 --> 16:19.083
No, you may not.

16:20.625 --> 16:22.208
Have a chair.

16:22.292 --> 16:23.750
I prefer to stand.

16:23.833 --> 16:25.500
That's an order.

16:27.958 --> 16:30.500
[instrumental music]

16:33.583 --> 16:37.125
You're the best officer
I've ever served with, Ivanova.

16:37.208 --> 16:40.458
I couldn't run this station
without you.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.750
'But I also consider
you a friend.'

16:44.167 --> 16:46.333
As your friend I'm telling you

16:46.417 --> 16:48.917
it does no good
to bottle up your feelings.

16:50.875 --> 16:53.083
Your father's dead.

16:53.167 --> 16:56.000
'You need to express your grief
or it'll eat you up.'

16:57.792 --> 16:59.875
I appreciate your concern,
commander.

17:01.667 --> 17:03.250
And your friendship.

17:04.333 --> 17:08.083
But...my feelings are my own.

17:08.167 --> 17:09.917
And how I display them..

17:10.000 --> 17:12.750
...or not...is my choice.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.750
Now..

17:16.833 --> 17:18.708
...if I may return to my duty?

17:23.375 --> 17:24.625
Susan.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.583
Before you make that choice

17:27.667 --> 17:30.125
make sure you know what it is
you're really feeling.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.167
[music continues]

17:46.500 --> 17:48.083
Mike?

17:48.167 --> 17:49.167
Yeah?

17:49.250 --> 17:50.250
About last night

17:50.333 --> 17:51.958
I thought it over,
you were right.

17:52.042 --> 17:54.042
It was my screw-up.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.292
I always did have
too much mouth.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.917
I'm sorry.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.750
'Can I sit?'

18:03.708 --> 18:05.375
So, what are you gonna do now?

18:05.458 --> 18:07.125
I really don't know.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.792
Maybe I'll catch some bouts
in the Off-World Circuit.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.250
Or maybe I'll hang up
the gloves for good.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.500
- You're kidding.
- It's been a long haul, Mike.

18:15.583 --> 18:19.000
A lot of blood, a lot of pain.
I don't know if it was worth it.

18:20.958 --> 18:23.125
The Sho-rin fights tonight.

18:23.208 --> 18:25.375
That's what they call
the champ of Mutai.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.875
I have a couple of ducks.
What do you say?

18:31.750 --> 18:33.667
At least I get a chance
to see what I missed.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.542
These ducks cost me a bundle.

18:38.417 --> 18:39.750
Garibaldi.

18:39.833 --> 18:41.917
(female #1)
'Chief, we got a 2-45 on Red 3.'

18:42.000 --> 18:43.500
'It looks like
the perp's zoned.'

18:43.583 --> 18:44.875
On the way.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.042
See you tonight.

18:48.125 --> 18:50.667
Alright, but if this is
some kind of hose job..

18:54.792 --> 18:57.792
[crowd cheering]

19:27.125 --> 19:30.208
[crowd cheering]

19:32.167 --> 19:34.958
The guy was a bum.
I could have taken him.

19:35.042 --> 19:36.667
[grumbles]

19:42.292 --> 19:43.750
This is good. What is it?

19:43.833 --> 19:45.833
Yokdri. Fried tree worm.

19:48.583 --> 19:50.917
Into the Sands of Blood

19:51.000 --> 19:53.792
comes Luh-Kar of the Drazi

19:53.875 --> 19:56.750
the bravest of his race.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.875
[crowd cheering]

20:02.417 --> 20:04.458
And now comes

20:04.542 --> 20:06.167
the Sho-rin.

20:06.250 --> 20:08.500
Master of the Mutai.

20:08.583 --> 20:11.250
Bravest of the brave.

20:11.333 --> 20:12.542
Gyor!

20:12.625 --> 20:16.333
[crowd cheering]
Gyor! Gyor!

20:19.500 --> 20:22.042
Fight with respect

20:22.125 --> 20:23.917
and courage.

20:25.500 --> 20:27.250
The Mutai begins!

20:31.958 --> 20:34.500
[crowd cheering]

20:58.833 --> 21:01.417
[cheering continues]

21:07.667 --> 21:11.708
The Sho-rin triumphs
and remains.

21:18.250 --> 21:20.833
Who is brave enough

21:20.917 --> 21:22.667
to challenge

21:22.750 --> 21:25.000
such a one?

21:25.083 --> 21:26.583
I am!

21:26.667 --> 21:29.125
[indistinct chatter]

21:29.208 --> 21:30.417
Are you nuts?

21:30.500 --> 21:32.917
Didn't you see what just
happened in there?

21:33.042 --> 21:34.542
It's my only shot, Mike.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.833
'By their rules'

21:35.917 --> 21:38.375
if the Sho-rin accepts
a direct challenge

21:38.458 --> 21:39.750
I get to fight.

21:39.833 --> 21:42.208
No matter what anyone else says.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.542
[intense music]

21:56.375 --> 22:00.792
Your people do not walk
in the Sands of Blood.

22:00.875 --> 22:03.083
They fear the Sho-rin.

22:03.167 --> 22:06.042
But I am the bravest of my race.

22:06.125 --> 22:08.167
And when I face him in the Mutai

22:08.250 --> 22:09.708
'their fear will be gone.'

22:09.792 --> 22:12.042
Look, he doesn't know what
he's saying. This is a mistake.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.542
Do not interfere.

22:17.667 --> 22:20.375
'The challenge is worthy.'

22:23.417 --> 22:25.833
What says the Sho-rin?

22:25.917 --> 22:28.458
[dramatic music]

22:32.875 --> 22:35.042
The challenge is accepted.

22:36.167 --> 22:38.625
'In three cycles'

22:38.708 --> 22:41.542
'the Mutai will take place.'

22:43.000 --> 22:46.625
[all cheering]
Gyor! Gyor!

22:56.500 --> 22:57.958
Sorry, Mike.

22:58.042 --> 23:00.542
You're gonna be a lot sorrier
when you step in there.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.500
Why do you do this, human?
You are not Mutari.

23:03.583 --> 23:07.000
- What's your problem, pal?
- You. All of you.

23:07.083 --> 23:10.750
You intrude upon our worlds.
Make mockery of our customs.

23:10.833 --> 23:13.458
Meddle in matters
you do not understand.

23:13.542 --> 23:17.708
But humans have no place
in the Mutai. It is ours.

23:17.792 --> 23:20.333
And we will not
let you dishonor it.

23:20.417 --> 23:23.000
Not now...not ever.

23:31.917 --> 23:34.500
[instrumental music]

23:36.792 --> 23:38.250
[doorbell beeps]

23:38.333 --> 23:39.833
Open.

23:42.583 --> 23:44.625
Rabbi.

23:44.708 --> 23:46.167
Susan.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.542
I owe you an apology.

23:47.625 --> 23:49.542
My behavior the other night
was inexcusable.

23:49.625 --> 23:52.333
- You came all this way for me--
- No, no, no, no.

23:52.417 --> 23:54.500
It is I who must apologize.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.958
I handled things badly.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.833
I brought your legacy.

24:01.375 --> 24:03.083
[gasps]

24:03.167 --> 24:04.500
The samovar.

24:04.583 --> 24:06.500
It was passed
through your family

24:06.583 --> 24:09.000
since the days of the tzars.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.458
Andrei prized it beyond all his
other possessions.

24:12.542 --> 24:14.042
I know.

24:14.125 --> 24:17.042
Well, I will be leaving
in the morning.

24:17.125 --> 24:19.750
There is nothing more
here for me to do.

24:19.833 --> 24:23.167
Unless you changed your mind
about the Shiva?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.625
It's not because
I've ceased being a Jew.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.333
Then why?

24:33.125 --> 24:37.000
My father was not
...a loving man.

24:37.083 --> 24:40.708
But in his own way
I always felt he loved me.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.208
Until my mother began
her Psi Corps treatment.

24:43.292 --> 24:46.542
It was the law.
There was nothing he could do.

24:47.458 --> 24:49.625
You cannot blame him for it.

24:49.708 --> 24:51.375
I don't.

24:51.458 --> 24:54.208
I blame him
for denying me his love.

24:54.292 --> 24:57.125
Even as mama became incapable
of giving me hers.

24:58.417 --> 25:00.917
I needed him, Yossel.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.458
And he wasn't there.

25:03.542 --> 25:05.417
My father wasn't there for me.

25:06.833 --> 25:09.125
And when mother took her life
and Ganya died

25:09.208 --> 25:12.083
still he couldn't find a shred
of love for me.

25:14.000 --> 25:16.125
So I left.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.917
And he never forgave me for it.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.292
As if I were the one
who'd abandoned him.

25:22.750 --> 25:25.917
And now
that he has left for good

25:26.000 --> 25:27.917
you cannot forgive him?

25:30.250 --> 25:32.042
No, I can't.

25:34.375 --> 25:37.875
Then the tragedy
is greater than I thought.

25:37.958 --> 25:40.917
Without forgiveness,
you cannot mourn.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.958
And without mourning

25:43.042 --> 25:45.583
you can never let go
of the pain.

25:49.708 --> 25:51.500
I have to go on duty.

25:51.583 --> 25:55.250
You cannot run away
from your own heart, Susan.

25:56.333 --> 25:58.208
Not even in space.

25:59.792 --> 26:02.042
Thank you for
bringing the samovar.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.083
I'll see you before you leave.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.542
[instrumental music]

26:13.250 --> 26:14.750
(woman on PA)
'We are sorry to announce..'

26:14.833 --> 26:16.375
Got any ideas
on how I should fight this guy?

26:16.458 --> 26:18.458
From inside a mean battle tank
would be good.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.167
I knew I could count on you.

26:21.417 --> 26:23.250
[grunting]

26:31.083 --> 26:33.083
You did well last night,
Earther.

26:33.167 --> 26:35.083
- Garibaldi.
- Caliban.

26:35.167 --> 26:38.167
He's the one who told me
about challenging the Sho-rin.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.458
- And what's your angle, pal?
- Angle?

26:40.542 --> 26:43.042
He wants to know
why you're helping me.

26:43.125 --> 26:44.708
Mmm.

26:44.792 --> 26:47.750
I too once challenged
the Sho-rin Gyor.

26:47.833 --> 26:49.750
It was my last Mutai.

26:49.833 --> 26:51.542
Now I will stand Ka-Tow

26:51.625 --> 26:53.333
to your friend.

26:53.417 --> 26:55.875
Garibaldi will also
stand Ka-Tow to me.

26:56.833 --> 26:58.125
As you wish.

26:58.208 --> 26:59.917
You must honor the Muta-Do

27:00.000 --> 27:02.250
before you begin.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.167
Listen very carefully.

27:05.167 --> 27:07.792
[indistinct chatter]

27:10.792 --> 27:13.917
[speaking in foreign language]

27:15.792 --> 27:17.000
(Susan)
'Uncle Yossel?'

27:17.083 --> 27:19.750
Ah! Susan.
I was afraid I'd miss you.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.042
[automated]
'Earth registered liner
White Star'

27:22.125 --> 27:25.375
'is now in final boarding
for departure to Earth.'

27:25.458 --> 27:26.667
My starship.

27:26.750 --> 27:30.167
- Thanks again for coming.
- My pleasure.

27:30.250 --> 27:33.667
Where else could I dine on Treel
with my favorite Ivanova?

27:35.833 --> 27:39.208
So...you'll take care
of yourself?

27:39.292 --> 27:40.708
Yes.

27:40.792 --> 27:43.125
You're very dear to me,
Suzotchka

27:43.208 --> 27:44.667
as you were to Andrei.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.875
Even if he never said it.

27:50.583 --> 27:53.000
Shalom, Suzotchka.

27:53.083 --> 27:55.208
May God keep you
in his thoughts.

27:56.625 --> 27:58.208
You too.

28:02.500 --> 28:05.083
[indistinct chatter]

28:07.333 --> 28:09.917
[instrumental music]

28:12.667 --> 28:14.917
(Andrei)
'I want you to know..'

28:16.958 --> 28:18.167
'...how proud'

28:18.250 --> 28:20.500
'I am of you, Susan.'

28:21.833 --> 28:23.750
I always have been.

28:25.208 --> 28:29.417
B-but a father should give
his daughter love..

28:29.500 --> 28:31.375
...as well as respect.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.208
And in that, I failed you.

28:37.250 --> 28:38.542
I'm sorry.

28:40.167 --> 28:42.542
And I'm ashamed.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.833
Forgive me.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.542
'Forgive me.'

28:53.583 --> 28:55.125
Uncle Yossel?

28:58.125 --> 28:59.750
Stay.

28:59.833 --> 29:01.625
Help me sit Shiva.

29:08.875 --> 29:11.375
[grunting]

29:18.792 --> 29:20.583
[groans]

29:22.583 --> 29:24.167
Oh, my God!

29:26.125 --> 29:27.833
- Nice punch.
- Glass jaw.

29:27.917 --> 29:29.792
But he kicks like a mule.

29:29.875 --> 29:32.958
- What is a mule?
- You're training one.

29:33.042 --> 29:34.833
You did well out there.

29:34.917 --> 29:36.042
Rest now.

29:36.125 --> 29:37.750
Buy you some dinner?

29:37.833 --> 29:39.625
Sounds good. Give me a minute.

29:42.208 --> 29:44.208
Has he got a chance?

29:44.292 --> 29:45.958
He will fight bravely.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.333
In sports, Babylon 5

29:49.417 --> 29:51.875
is about to be the site
of a history-making event

29:51.958 --> 29:53.625
as ex-sports Corp boxing star

29:53.708 --> 29:56.000
Walker Smith prepares
to be the first human

29:56.083 --> 29:57.458
'to fight in the Mutai.'

29:57.542 --> 29:59.417
What did I tell you, Mike?
History.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.750
Yeah, let's hope
you don't wind up history.

30:01.833 --> 30:03.708
You're my backup, remember?
My Ka-Tow.

30:03.792 --> 30:05.667
- Have some faith.
- What do you want me to do?

30:05.750 --> 30:06.708
Hire some cheerleaders?

30:06.792 --> 30:08.292
Walker, you're a great fighter

30:08.375 --> 30:10.375
but Gyor isn't some
Sport Corp media star.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.875
He's going in there
to take you apart.

30:11.958 --> 30:13.708
- And he can do it.
- I know.

30:13.792 --> 30:15.833
That's son of a spaceman's
the best I've ever seen.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.375
And you're still going
through with this?

30:17.458 --> 30:19.750
'You have always been thick,
Garibaldi.'

30:19.833 --> 30:21.542
That's what
the game's all about.

30:21.625 --> 30:24.458
To be the best,
you have to face the best.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.000
'I could take Vizaro
on crutches'

30:26.083 --> 30:30.542
but Gyor...he's gonna show me
where my heart is.

30:30.625 --> 30:31.708
And maybe..

30:31.792 --> 30:33.542
...I'll show him
a little something too.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.833
I'm gonna turn in.
See you tomorrow, buddy.

30:40.125 --> 30:41.375
Walker.

30:42.500 --> 30:44.542
You're the best I've ever seen.

30:44.625 --> 30:47.167
[dramatic music]

30:55.000 --> 30:57.417
Commander?
May I have a word?

30:57.500 --> 30:58.625
Of course.

30:58.708 --> 31:01.250
I'd like to take
your offer of leave.

31:01.333 --> 31:02.917
Granted.

31:03.000 --> 31:04.417
Thank you.

31:04.500 --> 31:05.958
'Lieutenant commander?'

31:06.042 --> 31:07.167
Yes, sir?

31:07.250 --> 31:08.333
It believe it's customary

31:08.417 --> 31:09.708
for friends to pay
their respects

31:09.792 --> 31:11.458
during Shiva.

31:11.542 --> 31:13.000
'I'll see you there.'

31:14.250 --> 31:15.917
I'd like that.

31:18.875 --> 31:21.417
[instrumental music]

31:27.667 --> 31:30.750
[speaking in foreign language]

31:35.208 --> 31:36.792
(all)
Amen.

31:38.542 --> 31:40.542
As you know,
we're all gathered here

31:40.625 --> 31:42.458
to help Susan sit Shiva

31:42.542 --> 31:44.667
for Andrei Ivanov..

31:44.750 --> 31:46.625
'...beloved husband of Sofie'

31:46.708 --> 31:48.083
'of blessed memory'

31:48.167 --> 31:49.958
'father of Ganya'

31:50.042 --> 31:51.375
'of blessed memory'

31:51.458 --> 31:54.792
and...of Susan.

31:54.875 --> 31:56.292
Most of you did not know

31:56.375 --> 31:57.875
Andrei Ivanova, so let me say

31:57.958 --> 31:59.917
a few words about him.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.958
He was..

32:02.042 --> 32:04.000
...a Russian Jew.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.750
And a scholar.

32:05.833 --> 32:08.333
A man devoted to logic

32:08.417 --> 32:10.500
and to reason.

32:10.583 --> 32:11.833
'And above all..'

32:13.375 --> 32:15.250
'...to peace.'

32:17.750 --> 32:18.958
Hmm, yeah, alright.

32:19.042 --> 32:20.333
He's got reach on you.
So, get inside.

32:20.417 --> 32:21.667
Watch his knees when you do.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.333
And keep moving.
Don't let him trap you.

32:24.417 --> 32:25.958
It is time.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.667
Let's do it.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.167
(Susan)
'When I was 13,
I had developed a passion for..'

32:34.250 --> 32:35.542
'...uh, Kasharev'

32:35.625 --> 32:37.542
'one of the radical,
neo-communist authors.'

32:37.625 --> 32:38.708
(Rabi)
'Oi.'

32:38.792 --> 32:40.375
'Your father felt that Kasharev'

32:40.458 --> 32:42.208
'would be personally
responsible'

32:42.292 --> 32:44.458
for the destruction
of Russian culture.

32:44.542 --> 32:46.000
[laughs]
Exactly.

32:46.083 --> 32:47.208
But he was invited to a reading

32:47.292 --> 32:49.542
by Kasharev, and I begged him
to take me.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.083
Of course, he had
no intention of going

32:51.167 --> 32:54.167
but I whined and pouted
as only a 13-year-old can.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.708
And eventually, he was forced
to surrender.

32:56.792 --> 32:59.667
So, after the reading, there was
a question-and-answer session.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.833
And for days,
I had been formulating

33:01.917 --> 33:03.500
the perfect question

33:03.583 --> 33:05.458
with which to impress my idol.

33:05.542 --> 33:06.542
So, you know, the time comes

33:06.625 --> 33:08.542
and I stand up, I'm trembling

33:08.625 --> 33:11.042
and I ask my question.

33:11.125 --> 33:12.375
And?

33:12.458 --> 33:14.708
Uh, he promptly said that
it was the most foolish thing

33:14.792 --> 33:17.250
that he ever heard and he had
no...intention of bending

33:17.333 --> 33:20.083
words of a bourgeois little twit
who was barely out of diapers.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.708
[all laughing]

33:21.792 --> 33:23.417
I was crushed.

33:23.500 --> 33:25.542
But then papa stood up.

33:25.625 --> 33:26.833
And he said that his daughter

33:26.917 --> 33:28.083
was neither bourgeois

33:28.167 --> 33:29.333
nor a little twit...

33:29.417 --> 33:30.542
and had been out of diapers

33:30.625 --> 33:32.083
for many, many years.

33:32.167 --> 33:33.250
while Kasharev's writing

33:33.333 --> 33:35.542
had yet to rise
above the contents

33:35.625 --> 33:36.917
of those garments.

33:37.000 --> 33:41.000
That sounds
exactly like Andrei.

33:41.083 --> 33:44.625
He then added that
were he not a man of peace..

33:44.708 --> 33:46.417
...he would have
horsewhipped Kasharev

33:46.500 --> 33:48.083
through the streets
of St. Petersburg

33:48.167 --> 33:51.333
as his own father should
have done many years ago.

33:51.417 --> 33:52.917
Bravo, bravo.

33:56.583 --> 33:59.000
Well, of course,
I was mortified.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.375
But then..

34:00.458 --> 34:03.667
...papa took my hand,
and he turned

34:03.750 --> 34:07.208
and as we walked out
he said to me..

34:07.292 --> 34:10.083
"...It was a good question,
dushenka."

34:13.917 --> 34:17.000
[indistinct chatter]

34:18.542 --> 34:20.125
[dramatic music]

34:20.208 --> 34:22.625
Into the Sands of Blood

34:22.708 --> 34:23.833
comes

34:23.917 --> 34:26.708
Walker Smith of Earth

34:26.792 --> 34:29.833
the bravest of his race.

34:29.917 --> 34:32.958
[crowd cheering]

34:42.375 --> 34:44.333
And now comes

34:44.417 --> 34:47.500
the Sho-rin.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.500
Master of the Mutai.

34:50.583 --> 34:52.792
Bravest of the brave.

34:53.792 --> 34:54.833
Gyor.

34:54.917 --> 34:58.083
[all cheering]
Gyor! Gyor! Gyor!

35:12.583 --> 35:15.958
Fight with courage
and respect.

35:17.542 --> 35:19.917
The Mutai begins.

35:21.083 --> 35:23.625
[intense music]

35:34.375 --> 35:37.542
[crowd cheering]
Gyor! Gyor! Gyor!

35:47.333 --> 35:49.167
Inside! Work inside!

35:53.792 --> 35:55.667
Yeah!

35:55.750 --> 35:58.917
[crowd cheering]
Gyor! Gyor! Gyor!

36:00.958 --> 36:03.708
(Garibaldi)
'Come on, back up!
Stay clear! Stay clear!'

36:03.792 --> 36:06.375
[music continues]

36:21.333 --> 36:22.958
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

36:25.000 --> 36:26.917
'Work inside! Work inside!'

36:29.667 --> 36:32.125
'Oh, yeah! Yeah! Yeah!'

36:33.333 --> 36:35.667
Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby! Go!

36:35.750 --> 36:37.000
Whoo!

36:37.083 --> 36:39.667
[indistinct shouting]

36:42.958 --> 36:44.583
The mule! The mule!

36:47.958 --> 36:49.917
(Garibaldi)
Watch the kick!
Watch the kick!

36:51.542 --> 36:54.125
[music continues]

37:03.458 --> 37:05.292
Back up! Stay clear!

37:05.375 --> 37:06.667
- Stay clear!
- No!

37:11.625 --> 37:14.458
This is Garibaldi. I have
a pickup for you in the Mutai.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.375
[music continues]

37:19.458 --> 37:21.083
- Come on!
- Yah!

37:23.667 --> 37:27.542
(Garibaldi)
'Yeah! Yeah! Whoo-hoo!'

37:31.375 --> 37:33.333
I want to thank all of you

37:33.417 --> 37:35.833
for sharing this time of..

37:35.917 --> 37:38.000
...sorrow with me.

37:38.083 --> 37:40.792
You've helped me
to find somebody..

37:40.875 --> 37:42.750
...long lost

37:42.833 --> 37:45.542
and...very precious to me.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.542
The father I loved.

37:51.458 --> 37:53.292
Though it's traditional
to recite

37:53.375 --> 37:56.167
the Mourning Prayer in Hebrew..

37:56.250 --> 37:59.250
...I would like to read it
in English tonight..

37:59.333 --> 38:01.417
...so that my good friend,
Jeffrey Sinclair..

38:02.583 --> 38:04.917
...may share it with us.

38:05.000 --> 38:07.542
[mellow music]

38:09.083 --> 38:11.750
"Oh, God, full of compassion..

38:11.833 --> 38:14.375
"...who dwell'est on high

38:14.458 --> 38:16.667
"...grant perfect rest
beneath the sheltering winds

38:16.750 --> 38:19.208
"of thy divine presence..

to Andrei, my father..

38:29.667 --> 38:32.000
...who has gone
to his eternal home.

38:33.917 --> 38:36.708
- Amen.
- Amen.

39:11.333 --> 39:13.375
[grunting]

39:20.292 --> 39:22.917
[crowd cheering

39:23.000 --> 39:24.375
(Garibaldi)
'What are they saying?'

39:24.458 --> 39:26.000
They call him "The Great Heart."

39:32.708 --> 39:35.292
[music continues]

39:44.333 --> 39:47.375
[intense music]

40:07.667 --> 40:09.833
It is done!

40:09.917 --> 40:12.500
[crowd cheering]

40:12.583 --> 40:14.958
Take it easy. It's over.

40:15.042 --> 40:17.250
- How'd I do?
- Uh, it's a draw.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.458
[indistinct chatter]

40:32.750 --> 40:35.875
[all cheering]
Gyor! Gyor! Gyor!

40:40.542 --> 40:42.250
Smith!

40:42.333 --> 40:45.500
[all cheering]
Smith! Smith! Smith!

40:47.125 --> 40:49.333

41:09.500 --> 41:10.958
(Susan)
'Thank you, Uncle Yossel.'

41:11.042 --> 41:15.000
You'll write or, uh
or com-link or whatever.

41:15.083 --> 41:16.458
I will.

41:16.542 --> 41:18.458
Commander?

41:18.542 --> 41:21.208
Ness gadol.
Take good care of it.

41:21.292 --> 41:23.417
[speaking in foreign language]

41:23.500 --> 41:24.750
Ooh!

41:24.833 --> 41:26.125
[laughing]

41:31.042 --> 41:33.375
I'm ready to go
back on duty, sir.

41:33.458 --> 41:37.125
Good. I've had my fill
of double shifts.

41:37.208 --> 41:38.708
Well, perhaps you'll
remember that next time

41:38.792 --> 41:40.875
Ms. Sakai visits the station.

41:46.667 --> 41:48.417
You're sure you can't
stick around for a while?

41:48.500 --> 41:50.250
And now that you're not
in training, I know some spots

41:50.333 --> 41:52.042
in Brown 6 we could haunt.

41:52.125 --> 41:54.667
I heal better in real air.

41:54.750 --> 41:56.333
Walker Smith!

42:01.417 --> 42:04.583
You fought well in the Mutai.

42:04.667 --> 42:07.792
From now on
humans may enter the ring

42:07.875 --> 42:11.458
as brothers
to all Mutari.

42:22.667 --> 42:25.292
[indistinct chatter on PA]

42:28.708 --> 42:32.833
If you ever return to the Mutai
I will stand Ka-Tow for you.

42:32.917 --> 42:36.167
- I wouldn't want anyone else.
- I'm honored, Smith.

42:36.250 --> 42:37.667
Safe voyage.

42:41.208 --> 42:42.750
Garibaldi, thanks.

42:44.375 --> 42:45.708
See you when I come back
for the rematch.

42:45.792 --> 42:47.708
Oh, give me a break.

42:50.333 --> 42:51.833
Watch your back.

42:53.583 --> 42:55.333
He fought bravely.

42:56.875 --> 42:59.125
The best I've ever seen.

42:59.208 --> 43:01.750
