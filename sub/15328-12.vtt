WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:03.002
- Hey, babe?

00:03.086 --> 00:05.880
Guess what I scored
from a grateful patient?

00:05.964 --> 00:07.841
A nice bottle of champagne.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.342
- Did somebody say champagne?

00:12.011 --> 00:13.596
Oh.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.849
[unintelligible] from 1995.

00:15.932 --> 00:18.935
This is
a $700 bottle of champagne.

00:19.018 --> 00:20.520
You better pop that sucka open.

00:20.603 --> 00:23.398
Don't bother dirtying a glass.

00:23.481 --> 00:24.607
- If it's that nice
of a bottle,

00:24.691 --> 00:26.526
maybe we should save it
for a special occasion.

00:26.609 --> 00:28.653
- Your loving mother is here.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.530
What could be
more of an occasion?

00:30.613 --> 00:33.616
- Her loving mother not here.

00:33.700 --> 00:37.120
- Charlie Phillips...that
hurt my heart.

00:37.203 --> 00:41.207
And nothing will mend it
like that bottle of champagne.

00:41.291 --> 00:42.208
Thank you.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.711
- Uh, no, no, no.
Oh, no.

00:44.794 --> 00:46.588
We are saving this for when--

00:46.671 --> 00:49.549
Ebnetter has a huge boat
in our backyard.

00:49.632 --> 00:51.259
- That's awfully specific.

00:51.342 --> 00:52.886
- No, no, no, seriously.

00:52.969 --> 00:54.804
He's got a big boat
parked out there.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.639
- Hallelujah!

00:56.723 --> 00:58.099
Crack that baby open.

00:58.183 --> 00:59.142
I get the first sip.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.602
- Uh!

01:03.104 --> 01:05.272
Why is there a boat in my yard?

01:05.355 --> 01:06.816
- How cool is this?

01:06.900 --> 01:07.984
- See, dad?

01:08.067 --> 01:09.319
Wishing wells do work.

01:09.402 --> 01:12.030
And you said I was
just throwing money away.

01:12.113 --> 01:16.743
I just bought a boat
for a penny.

01:16.826 --> 01:19.829
- Ahoy, neighbors!

01:19.913 --> 01:24.292
You may look at the SS Man Cave,
but do not touch.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.919
- Excuse me?

01:26.002 --> 01:29.255
Part of that hunk of junk
is in our yard.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.216
- Part of it isn't.

02:10.295 --> 02:10.839
{\an8}onto our property a little.

02:10.922 --> 02:13.258
{\an8}Huh.
Where's my phone?

02:13.341 --> 02:14.968
{\an8}I'm gonna call the coast guard.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.135
{\an8}- Really?

02:16.219 --> 02:17.345
{\an8}The coast guard?

02:17.428 --> 02:18.513
{\an8}- You don't know.

02:18.596 --> 02:20.682
{\an8}They might have a backyard unit.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.561
{\an8}- What's up with Dad?

02:24.644 --> 02:25.895
{\an8}- Take a look out there.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.315
{\an8}- Wow, that is quite the sight.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.358
{\an8}- I know, right?

02:30.441 --> 02:32.360
{\an8}That boat is practically
in our kitchen.

02:32.443 --> 02:34.195
{\an8}- Who's looking at a boat?

02:34.279 --> 02:35.989
{\an8}I'm looking at
that gorgeous Kyle Ebnetter.

02:36.072 --> 02:37.866
{\an8}When did he get home
from college?

02:37.949 --> 02:40.743
{\an8}And when did he grow muscles?

02:40.827 --> 02:43.329
{\an8}Ooh, I need lip gloss.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.373
{\an8}- So you're not gonna help me
with my homework?

02:45.456 --> 02:47.417
{\an8}- Listen you, I asked you
to help take out the trash,

02:47.500 --> 02:48.751
{\an8}and you didn't.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.379
{\an8}- That's because I asked you
to help me fix my bicycle,

02:51.462 --> 02:56.342
{\an8}and you said take a hike,
which I ended up doing.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.011
{\an8}- That's because
the day before that

02:58.094 --> 02:59.721
{\an8}I asked if I could borrow
your fingerprints,

02:59.804 --> 03:02.098
{\an8}and you were like,
"I don't think that's legal."

03:02.181 --> 03:03.850
{\an8}- All right, all right, enough!

03:03.933 --> 03:06.644
{\an8}You boys are always going on
about who did what for who.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.272
You don't help people
just to get something back.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.233
You do it because a good deed
is its own reward.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.735
If you see somebody
who needs help,

03:13.818 --> 03:15.862
you just help them.

03:15.945 --> 03:19.073
- Wow, look at Mr. Ebnetter

03:19.157 --> 03:21.534
struggling
with that big toolbox.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.454
- Yeah, he really shouldn't
be carrying that by himself.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.664
He looks really sweating
and huffy puffy,

03:26.748 --> 03:28.166
like he's gonna pass out.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.209
Makes me wanna cool off
with a Popsicle.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.294
- Yeah, me, too.

03:31.377 --> 03:32.670
Get me a purple one
to match his face.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.173
- Okay, that's it.

03:35.256 --> 03:38.551
Boys, this is the perfect chance
to help a neighbor in need.

03:38.635 --> 03:41.679
Even if what he really needs is
a good kick in the--

03:41.763 --> 03:43.556
Anyway.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.141
- What do we get out it?
- Nothing.

03:45.224 --> 03:45.516
- And $20?

03:45.600 --> 03:47.810
- No!

03:47.894 --> 03:50.229
We're doing it because
it's the right thing to do.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.522
Follow me.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.316
- Coast guard laughed at me,

03:53.399 --> 03:55.485
but I'm on hold
with the U.S. Navy.

03:55.568 --> 03:56.319
Where are you guys headed?

03:56.402 --> 03:57.320
- Over to the Ebnetter's.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.488
- Good. With any luck,

03:58.571 --> 04:00.073
I'll have a team of SEALS
coming right behind you.

04:00.156 --> 04:04.285
- One big walrus
would be better, Dad.

04:04.369 --> 04:05.453
- Honey, hang up the phone.

04:05.536 --> 04:06.079
His crazy is cute.

04:06.162 --> 04:08.164
But you're a grown man.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.417
- [groaning]

04:11.501 --> 04:14.671
- All right, boys, watch
and learn about generosity.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.755
Hey, Mr. Ebnetter.
- Yeah.

04:15.838 --> 04:18.048
- I happened to notice
you were having trouble

04:18.132 --> 04:19.050
carrying that big toolbox.

04:19.132 --> 04:21.219
And I'd like to offer you
my help.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.387
- What's in it for you?

04:22.470 --> 04:25.348
- I opened at 20,
but she wasn't having it.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.808
- There's nothing in it for me.

04:26.891 --> 04:28.559
I'm just being a good neighbor.

04:28.643 --> 04:30.812
- Seems foolish on your part,
but why not?

04:30.895 --> 04:32.355
I already threw out
a disk in my back.

04:32.438 --> 04:37.527
- Oh, well, if you're in pain,
even more reason to help.

04:37.610 --> 04:40.071
[groans]

04:40.154 --> 04:42.657
That's a lot of tools.

04:42.740 --> 04:45.118
- Well, there's my Mr. Fix-It.

04:45.201 --> 04:46.619
I made you some lemonade.

04:46.703 --> 04:48.371
Oh, and we have visitors.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.707
- Phwwww!

04:50.790 --> 04:52.375
How 'bout adding some sugar?

04:52.458 --> 04:56.713
Every aperture in my body
is slamming shut.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.131
- So interesting, Hoyt.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.882
The last time you spit it out
was because it was too sweet.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.885
- [groaning] Very heavy here.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.387
- Well, there's gotta be
something on the spectrum

05:04.470 --> 05:07.849
between sugar coma
and your mother's face.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.727
- My mother earned that face.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.562
- [groaning]
I hate to interrupt.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.731
- From now on, store-bought.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.190
- Store-bought lemonade?

05:16.274 --> 05:20.111
Why don't you just set my money
on fire, woman?

05:20.194 --> 05:21.529
- [groaning] So...toolbox.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.573
- Huh?

05:23.656 --> 05:24.490
Oh, just set it down
where I had it.

05:24.574 --> 05:25.825
I put it there for a reason.

05:25.908 --> 05:29.245
I thought you were
trying to be helpful.

05:29.328 --> 05:30.705
- My mistake.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.582
- [crash]

05:32.665 --> 05:35.668
- So...what'd
we learn just now?

05:35.752 --> 05:41.507
- That lemonade is a delicate
dance of sweet and tart.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.800
- No.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.927
We learned that good people
help each other

05:45.011 --> 05:46.262
without expecting
anything in return.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.765
- Hey, if you really wanna be
a good person,

05:48.848 --> 05:51.893
I could use some help with that
little patch on the hull there.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.519
I'd have my son Kyle do it,

05:53.603 --> 05:56.898
but I wouldn't trust
that disappointment with paint.

05:56.981 --> 05:58.399
- She already
picked up your box, greedy.

05:58.483 --> 05:59.734
Quit taking advantage.

05:59.817 --> 06:01.819
- Yeah!
You only help a person once

06:01.903 --> 06:03.488
without getting something
in return.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.947
Right, Steph?

06:05.031 --> 06:07.533
Even if what he really needs
is a good kick in the--

06:07.617 --> 06:11.204
- Oh, well, aren't you
a little tape recorder?

06:11.287 --> 06:13.289
- What's a tape recorder?

06:13.372 --> 06:15.041
- Never mind that.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.544
You help people--any people--
as long as they need help.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.755
So you just want me to touch-up
that little patch?

06:20.838 --> 06:22.590
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, fine.

06:22.673 --> 06:24.050
- And then make
the rest of the boat match it.

06:26.010 --> 06:28.012
- ♪

06:30.556 --> 06:34.018
- Steph, how long
do we have to be good people?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.603
- Until you understand
how good it feels.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.355
Ow! A splinter!

06:42.693 --> 06:43.694
- How's it going?

06:43.778 --> 06:46.197
- Uh, it's taking longer
than I thought.

06:46.280 --> 06:48.366
Apparently, you have to sand
before you paint.

06:48.449 --> 06:51.911
I learned that fun fact
after we painted.

06:51.994 --> 06:54.163
- Would've been easier
if you'd used my power sander.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.666
- Would have been easier
if you told me you had one.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.711
- I borrowed it from your
husband a couple of years ago.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.755
It's in my garage.

07:02.839 --> 07:03.923
I'll get it for you.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.175
Ohh!
There goes the other disk.

07:06.259 --> 07:09.804
Oh, my back
is like a CD changer.

07:09.887 --> 07:10.847
- What's a CD changer?

07:10.930 --> 07:11.889
- Never mind that.

07:11.973 --> 07:14.267
I'll get the sander.

07:14.350 --> 07:16.018
- Yeah, it's behind all those
heavy boxes and cinderblocks.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.566
- Let's get out
while we have the chance.

07:21.649 --> 07:22.191
- If our stepmom
is looking for us,

07:22.275 --> 07:24.026
we're being good people.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.778
- Good people
watching cartoons.

07:25.862 --> 07:26.946
- Say!

07:27.029 --> 07:29.282
You boys, uh,
ever been out on a boat?

07:29.365 --> 07:29.866
- Does the log ride count?

07:29.949 --> 07:34.162
- No, that's a log.

07:34.245 --> 07:35.163
Well, I love boats.

07:35.246 --> 07:37.123
In fact, I'm planning
to live on this one.

07:37.206 --> 07:40.418
And I'll be looking for a couple
of crew members to help me out.

07:40.501 --> 07:43.546
Even take the helm,
occasionally.

07:43.629 --> 07:44.422
Of course,
that won't be you two,

07:44.505 --> 07:45.798
because you're walking
off the job.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.717
- Who's walking?

07:47.800 --> 07:48.718
I'm taking the helm.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.094
Let's get back to sanding.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.220
- Nope.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.432
I'm not helping unless
he lets us drive the boat.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.475
- Taking the helm
is driving the boat.

07:56.559 --> 08:01.230
- I told you not to correct me
in front of other people, James.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.441
- So, Mr. Ebnetter.

08:03.524 --> 08:04.609
[giggles] A boat.

08:04.692 --> 08:06.485
Where's Kyle?

08:06.569 --> 08:07.486
- Oh, him.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.571
He'll be back.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.906
He's breaking up
with his girlfriend

08:09.989 --> 08:12.700
because she didn't enjoy
working on the boat with him.

08:12.783 --> 08:13.743
What he's really looking for

08:13.826 --> 08:16.204
is a girl who knows
how to swab a deck.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.079
- [giggles] I know how
to swab a deck.

08:17.163 --> 08:20.791
- What a lucky twist of fate.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.628
Of course, we're gonna need
to finish the deck first.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.546
- I'm on it.
Make sure you tell Kyle.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.548
- [laughing]
Good.

08:27.632 --> 08:29.592
While you do that, I'll
work--ow!

08:29.675 --> 08:32.094
Oh, there goes
my sailor's elbow.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.346
Don't look that up
on the Internet.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.597
It's a real thing.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.475
Well, since I can't work,
I guess I'll go check

08:37.558 --> 08:45.066
the marine, uh, tide,
nautical thingy, whatever.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.277
- Listen, Aaron, we can't tell
Stephanie we're only doing this

08:48.361 --> 08:50.321
because we're getting
something awesome out of it.

08:50.404 --> 08:51.614
- Duh, James.

08:51.697 --> 08:56.494
I'm 10, not a goldfish.

08:56.577 --> 08:58.412
- Why are you all working
on the boat of my sworn enemy?

08:58.496 --> 09:01.666
- Stephanie's teaching us
to be good people.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.876
- Uh, I heard about that.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.170
Why are you really doing it?

09:06.254 --> 09:07.338
- I want to date Kyle.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.465
- And Mr. Ebnetter said he's
gonna live on the boat,

09:09.548 --> 09:11.133
and we can drive the helm.

09:11.217 --> 09:12.635
- You had me at
"he's gonna live on the boat."

09:12.718 --> 09:14.470
Let's get that man out to sea!

09:16.097 --> 09:17.974
- Charlie, I just realized!

09:18.057 --> 09:22.562
Today is the anniversary
of my glorious divorce!

09:22.645 --> 09:25.314
- I'm not opening my champagne
to celebrate your divorce.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.482
- Then how 'bout Flag Day?

09:26.565 --> 09:27.358
- It's not Flag Day.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.234
- It is in East Germany.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.361
- There is no East Germany.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.570
It was liberated.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.155
- [in German accent] Vander-bal!

Then let's crack open

You help us get this boat
on the water.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.959
And as soon as it is,
we'll open the champagne.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.460
- Make room on the deck.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.878
Mama's thirsty.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.588
- Whoa!
What about Stephanie?

09:49.672 --> 09:51.048
- No, don't give her any.

09:51.132 --> 09:54.802
She's just gonna ruin it
with orange juice.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.554
- Not the champagne.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.140
I'm talking about the lesson
she's trying to teach the kids.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.559
If she finds out we're doing
this for the wrong reasons,

10:01.642 --> 10:03.269
she'll shut
the whole thing down.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.021
And nobody will get
what they want.

10:05.104 --> 10:07.231
- Okay, I don't say this often.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.692
But we're gonna
have to lie to my baby.

10:09.775 --> 10:10.776

10:10.860 --> 10:13.029
- I say it every week,
what's your point?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.822
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.264
- I haven't seen her.

17:37.347 --> 17:40.142
Boy, she's never been as mad
as she was at Mr. Ebnetter.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.435
- No kidding.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.979
She just kept slamming things
around and muttering.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.647
I finally put in earplugs.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.440
- Is that why
she kicked you out

17:46.523 --> 17:48.650
and made you sleep in our room?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.195
- Thanks for taking the floor,
buddy.

17:51.278 --> 17:51.820
- [sighs]

17:51.904 --> 17:54.323
Good morning, everyone.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.825
- Honey, you seem
less screechy, slammy

17:56.909 --> 18:01.497
than you were last night when
you pushed me into the hallway.

18:01.580 --> 18:05.209
- [sings] I don't trust it.

18:05.292 --> 18:06.627
- Obviously, I was really mad
at Mr. Ebnetter,

18:06.710 --> 18:08.670
but it's a new day.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.380
And I found a way
to get over it.

18:10.464 --> 18:13.467
- [sings] I still
don't trust it.

18:13.550 --> 18:15.010
- [doorbell rings]

18:17.888 --> 18:21.183
- Well, there you are...hiding
in plain sight.

18:21.266 --> 18:21.642
- Shame on you.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.435
- Excuse me?

18:23.519 --> 18:25.187
- Don't play coy with us.

18:25.270 --> 18:30.067
Last night, someone ran a hose
from this house into my boat

18:30.150 --> 18:31.652
and flooded the whole thing,

18:31.735 --> 18:34.363
which was both ironic
and very effective.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.490
The SS Man Cave has been ruined.

18:36.573 --> 18:38.242
- Now wait just a minute,
buster.

18:38.325 --> 18:40.160
You're nuts if you think
anyone in this family

18:40.244 --> 18:41.203
did something like that.

18:41.286 --> 18:41.662
- I don't think anyone.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.997
I think you.

18:44.081 --> 18:44.790
- [laughs]

18:44.873 --> 18:46.375
That's absurd.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.876
Charlie,
can you believe this?

18:47.960 --> 18:48.877
- That you would do it?

18:48.961 --> 18:52.005
Or that you did do it?

18:52.089 --> 18:52.965
- Charlie!

18:53.048 --> 18:54.466
- Oh, of course not,
she wouldn't do it.

18:54.550 --> 18:55.634
No, she would never do it.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.011
- Way to cover for her, Dad.

18:58.095 --> 18:59.054
- Cover for me?

18:59.137 --> 19:00.639
You were all mad at him.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.975
- Yeah, but you were the one
who said you found a way

19:03.058 --> 19:04.059
to get over it.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.979
- I took a long bath
and lit a scented candle.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.021
French vanilla.

19:08.105 --> 19:10.065
Then, I ate a pint of ice cream.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.150
Also French vanilla.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.612
- Then, you flooded my boat!

19:15.696 --> 19:17.698
- What is
all the ruckus in here?

19:17.781 --> 19:19.658
It--ooooh.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.535
- What about her?

19:21.618 --> 19:23.620
- Could be.

19:23.704 --> 19:24.079
- What?

19:24.163 --> 19:25.622
- Did you do it?

19:25.706 --> 19:27.916
- Yeah, I did it!

19:28.000 --> 19:31.753
I let the air
out of Ebnetter's tires,

19:31.837 --> 19:35.591
and I make no apologies.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.594
- What about my boat?

19:38.677 --> 19:39.845
- What about your boat?

19:39.928 --> 19:42.890
Don't know how to let
no air out of no boat.

19:42.973 --> 19:44.600
- No, someone ran a hose
into the Ebnetter's boat.

19:44.683 --> 19:45.726
Did you do it?

19:45.809 --> 19:47.603
- Absolutely not.

19:47.686 --> 19:48.729
Was it you?

19:48.812 --> 19:52.024
Because you were mad.

19:52.107 --> 19:55.277
- [scoffs] I didn't flood
Mr. Ebnetter's boat!

19:55.360 --> 19:57.821
I just wanted
a stinking thank you.

19:57.905 --> 19:58.488
- Well, you're not
gonna get one now

19:58.572 --> 20:00.449
after you flooded my boat.

20:00.532 --> 20:01.408
- Don't agitate her, Hoyt.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.911
She'll come after our house.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.454
- You haven't heard
the last from me.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.873
Or the good people
at Atlantic Quickie Insurance,

20:07.956 --> 20:09.374
where their slogan is
"Come in for insurance"!

20:14.254 --> 20:15.589
- One little thing.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.132
I flooded the boat.

20:17.215 --> 20:17.633
I didn't want Hoyt living on it.

20:17.716 --> 20:19.635
You understand.

20:19.718 --> 20:20.802
Bye.

20:23.388 --> 20:24.640
Thanks for taking the blame.

20:24.723 --> 20:29.645
I know how touchy you are
about thank yous.
