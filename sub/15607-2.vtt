00:15.693 --> 00:22.334
_

00:32.430 --> 00:35.558
- You are anxious.
- No, I'm not. I'm not anxious.

00:37.012 --> 00:40.076
This work I am set to, my
research in Whitechapel,

00:40.102 --> 00:43.148
- you do not wish me to undertake it.
- That I do not. No.

00:43.369 --> 00:46.597
You think I'll be set
upon by wolves and demons.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.908
But I told you before, I'm equal to them.

00:48.934 --> 00:51.832
We are, none of us, equal to Whitechapel.

00:52.605 --> 00:54.802
Then you are not only anxious for me,

00:54.828 --> 00:57.384
for today, you return to
your duties at Lehman Street.

00:57.410 --> 01:00.320
I am not anxious for that, Mathilda.

01:00.346 --> 01:01.851
I am not anxious at all.

01:01.877 --> 01:05.081
- Then I may go about my work alone.
- You know you may not.

01:05.107 --> 01:08.448
It is your first day at it, and
you will go with me or not at all.

01:08.990 --> 01:12.319
And so you win yourself
and hour or two's delay

01:12.320 --> 01:16.049
before you walk through those
doors and become a policeman again.

01:23.849 --> 01:26.099
Idle drinking violent.

01:26.100 --> 01:30.698
I shall mark these houses
lowest class, loafer, vicious.

01:32.178 --> 01:34.979
I have my doubts that these
categories of Mr. Booth's.

01:34.980 --> 01:37.139
They do not do justice
to the human reality.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.971
These people are not
vicious or idle or violent.

01:39.997 --> 01:41.662
They do not choose this existence.

01:41.688 --> 01:43.766
And yet in but three
words they are condemned.

01:43.792 --> 01:46.261
Mr. Booth's categories
are none of your concern.

01:46.287 --> 01:48.575
This is not your work. It is mine.

01:49.410 --> 01:52.692
I shall see to this house myself, alone.

02:36.940 --> 02:38.354
I die.

02:38.380 --> 02:42.726
Father, Father!

02:47.187 --> 02:48.979
Father, he's dying.

02:49.005 --> 02:50.449
There, boy.

02:50.552 --> 02:51.942
Open your chest.

02:52.210 --> 02:53.901
What's your name? Where's your mother?

02:54.709 --> 02:56.485
I'm dying. I die.

02:56.511 --> 02:57.741
I am here. You are not alone.

02:57.767 --> 02:58.967
What is your name?

03:02.958 --> 03:05.819
- Tommy.
- Tommy, there, Tommy.

03:06.388 --> 03:10.190
Do not be afraid. I am here. I'm here.

04:33.399 --> 04:35.198
Where is it, my love? I shall be late.

04:35.480 --> 04:38.663
Well, I'm quite sure I washed
at least one of your shirts.

04:38.689 --> 04:41.649
- And then there's so much linen.
- All right. It's all right. Here it is.

04:42.046 --> 04:44.122
Yeah, a little damp, but, ah...

04:44.148 --> 04:46.281
Here you go, Connor. Here.

04:46.307 --> 04:47.993
- No.
- Come on, Connor.

04:48.019 --> 04:49.579
- No.
- All right, all right, all right.

04:49.605 --> 04:51.062
- Connor.
- Give us a go.

04:51.390 --> 04:54.551
Now, little fella, how are you
gonna grow up big and strong

04:54.577 --> 04:56.309
unless you drink your milk?

05:04.950 --> 05:07.988
Connor Drake, I hereby arrest you

05:08.014 --> 05:10.724
for the criminal waste of
milk and the destruction

05:10.750 --> 05:12.283
of police property.

05:12.804 --> 05:14.004
Eh?

05:14.162 --> 05:16.038
Now what do you think about that?

05:16.064 --> 05:19.481
What you gonna do about
that, young sir? Eh?

05:19.875 --> 05:21.460
He is safe.

05:22.111 --> 05:24.514
He is loved, our boy.

05:28.980 --> 05:31.621
Even now, your Rose holds him in her arms.

05:31.647 --> 05:33.464
Do you find no comfort in that?

05:38.570 --> 05:39.999
You're free.

05:42.240 --> 05:43.833
You're alive.

05:44.332 --> 05:45.826
And we're together.

05:46.958 --> 05:48.158
Yeah...

05:49.167 --> 05:50.976
We are. We are safe.

05:52.285 --> 05:54.041
Let us delight in that.

05:55.910 --> 05:58.859
900 days we were apart.

05:59.880 --> 06:05.305
And I counted them, every one,
and I bled each and every hour.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.160
You can't leave.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.701
900 days.

06:21.839 --> 06:24.328
All the hours we have lost.

06:26.997 --> 06:29.289
We must make amends.

06:45.093 --> 06:47.643
Captain Jackson will be along
shortly. I have no doubt, sir.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.311
It's a workhouse boy.

06:49.695 --> 06:51.325
This red scalp is iodine.

06:51.351 --> 06:53.267
Workhouse practise against ringworm.

06:53.293 --> 06:55.406
Sergeant, Get on to the
workhouses between here and

06:55.432 --> 06:57.519
Poplar. See who's gone
missing. Find out who he is.

06:57.545 --> 07:00.458
His name is Tommy, and he has a
birth mark here behind his left ear.

07:00.484 --> 07:03.183
And how shall I mark the
case, sir? It is murder?

07:03.209 --> 07:06.738
It is not a case as such.
I mean to find his family,

07:06.764 --> 07:08.399
- give him a proper burial.
- But...

07:08.425 --> 07:12.094
but I must log the action,
sir. It's how it is done now.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.475
And what is your name, lad?

07:14.501 --> 07:16.699
Drummond, sir, Samuel Drummond.

07:17.008 --> 07:19.169
Do not worry yourself, Samuel Drummond.

07:19.195 --> 07:20.982
It is a matter only for me.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.633
Very good, sir.

07:23.850 --> 07:27.125
And if you'll come with me now,
Mr. Drake is expecting you, sir.

07:41.517 --> 07:45.634
I, Edmund John James Reid,
being appointed a constable

07:45.660 --> 07:48.659
of the police force of the
Metropolitan Police district,

07:48.660 --> 07:51.191
do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare

07:51.217 --> 07:53.631
that I will serve our
sovereign lady Queen Victoria

07:53.657 --> 07:56.042
and in all respects to the best of my skill

07:56.068 --> 07:59.337
and knowledge discharge
the said office faithfully

07:59.363 --> 08:00.941
and according to law.

08:05.102 --> 08:06.636
Who'd have thought, eh?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.058
Welcome back, Inspector.

08:17.315 --> 08:19.864
You have heard me speak often
enough of this gentleman,

08:19.890 --> 08:21.181
Mr. Edmund Reid.

08:21.182 --> 08:23.934
We are lucky indeed to
have him back with us.

08:23.935 --> 08:27.026
I see this wall soon
empty now he has returned.

08:33.725 --> 08:36.956
And if I may, a little something
to east you back to work.

08:37.924 --> 08:42.200
A curious case, a spate of
attacks, the victims separated

08:42.226 --> 08:43.683
from their right hands.

08:43.684 --> 08:45.549
I have other business I must attend to,

08:45.575 --> 08:48.111
but Sergeant Drummond will see you fitted

08:48.137 --> 08:49.934
with all the particulars of the case

08:49.935 --> 08:51.675
and show you to the suspect.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.074
Give this silent fellow a stir.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.636
See if you can't make him whistle.

09:08.974 --> 09:11.004
Witness statements are
included herein, sir.

09:11.005 --> 09:12.630
You'll find 'em in dates order.

09:12.955 --> 09:15.734
- None of the witnesses could identify...
- Riot, riot!

09:15.735 --> 09:18.294
Salvation Army, the
show is on Buckle Street.

09:18.295 --> 09:19.609
They are set upon!

09:27.715 --> 09:29.111
We'll see to this, Mr. Reid.

09:48.910 --> 09:50.616
I am Inspector Reid.

09:51.065 --> 09:52.709
Your name and business, sir.

09:52.915 --> 09:54.734
I told them slops before.

09:54.735 --> 09:56.414
I don't talk to the police.

09:56.415 --> 09:57.849
- Slops?
- Hmm.

09:58.814 --> 10:01.704
You've been accused of
severing the hands of four men.

10:01.755 --> 10:03.207
It's a most particular crime,

10:03.233 --> 10:05.613
in some cultures, the
punishment for thieving.

10:06.245 --> 10:09.491
Slops, coster speak for police.

10:09.517 --> 10:12.355
You're a costermonger, a market trader.

10:12.735 --> 10:14.568
And you serve your own justice on those

10:14.594 --> 10:16.054
who would thieve from you.

10:16.055 --> 10:18.024
You part them from their
light-fingered hands.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.877
It's old coster practise, this.

10:20.906 --> 10:22.158
What's your stall?

10:26.139 --> 10:31.156
These scars, you must
need knives for your trade.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.382
You are a butcher.

10:34.110 --> 10:36.958
But the scars on the
underside of your palm.

10:40.075 --> 10:43.830
So you hold your work in your
left, your knife in your right.

10:46.795 --> 10:48.333
You are an oyster-shucker.

10:51.515 --> 10:54.087
Mr. Reid, you are asked for, sir.

10:54.245 --> 10:55.807
The boy's mother is found.

11:13.835 --> 11:16.304
You have my boy. Where is he, sir?

11:16.305 --> 11:18.200
I was at my interviews down Durwood Street,

11:18.226 --> 11:21.334
and along comes this lady, knocking
on all the doors just as I was.

11:21.335 --> 11:23.234
Looking for her boy, she says.

11:23.402 --> 11:25.504
Who but two streets from my Tommy,

11:25.505 --> 11:27.884
I thought perhaps he
might be the boy she seeks.

11:27.885 --> 11:30.314
Sir, I beg you. Take
me to him if he be here.

11:30.315 --> 11:33.304
- Oh, dear God, sir, let me see him.
- Madame, be advised.

11:33.305 --> 11:36.000
The boy that we hold is dead.

11:52.452 --> 11:54.453
O God, save us.

11:58.650 --> 12:00.188
O God, forgive me.

12:00.214 --> 12:02.141
I lost my boy.

12:02.913 --> 12:05.020
I couldn't keep him no more.

12:06.607 --> 12:08.898
I must have put him in the workhouse.

12:08.924 --> 12:10.791
I couldn't feed him.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.853
I... I thought he would be safest there.

12:15.545 --> 12:16.857
Look at him.

12:19.309 --> 12:22.009
O God, look what they did to him.

12:27.729 --> 12:29.498
Poor boy.

12:30.475 --> 12:35.302
The boy, sir, is Tommy Riggs, missing
from Whitechapel Union Workhouse.

12:36.318 --> 12:38.398
Go to the mother. See
she wants for nothing.

12:38.803 --> 12:41.067
I have questions that must
be answered at the workhouse.

12:41.093 --> 12:44.513
I wish to know how a boy in its
care may die in such abjection.

12:46.565 --> 12:50.792
Sergeant, our suspect,
he is a costermonger.

12:50.818 --> 12:52.447
Oysters are his trade.

12:52.473 --> 12:55.324
Seek out every seller in this
square mile, for he's one of them.

12:55.325 --> 12:58.215
We may know his identity and
shuck his confession from him.

13:18.383 --> 13:22.204
Mr. Wilde, I have in my morgue in
Lehman Street a young boy, Tommy Riggs.

13:22.230 --> 13:25.830
I am concerned, sir, at the state in
which I found him... underfed, neglected.

13:25.856 --> 13:28.393
- Mortally, sir.
- Tommy Riggs?

13:28.815 --> 13:32.825
Yes, a runaway missing this week past.

13:33.395 --> 13:36.344
I'm afraid I can not account for
what became of him beyond these walls.

13:36.345 --> 13:39.702
These poor souls whose parents
have neglected them, so many

13:39.728 --> 13:41.380
feel compelled to run away.

13:41.915 --> 13:44.647
They do not see that the
workhouse is for their own safety.

13:45.545 --> 13:47.485
It's our... our greatest sorrow.

13:47.511 --> 13:49.583
Nevertheless, sir, I should
like to see for myself

13:49.609 --> 13:52.131
the conditions in which
the children are kept.

13:53.395 --> 13:56.044
Yes. Let me show you, Inspector Reid,

13:56.070 --> 13:57.977
how we treat our children here.

13:58.318 --> 14:01.726
Arthur here is one of our boys,
trained now in clerical work.

14:01.752 --> 14:04.529
Next year, he will leave the workhouse
with all the skills needed to...

14:04.555 --> 14:06.053
to build a life for himself.

14:06.055 --> 14:09.352
This is our great purpose. Come.

14:14.695 --> 14:17.424
We mean to turn these
destitute young people

14:17.425 --> 14:22.254
into viable members of society,
self-sufficient, productive.

14:22.405 --> 14:24.552
Here, you see we teach literacy.

14:27.805 --> 14:30.603
Along here, domestic skills.

14:30.973 --> 14:35.257
For too long, the workhouse has been
a form of incarceration for the poor...

14:35.283 --> 14:38.494
no hope of release, no hope of, er, future.

14:39.910 --> 14:43.986
We must let go of this notion
of deterrent, of threat,

14:44.012 --> 14:46.904
and instead give the
poor hope and possibility.

14:46.905 --> 14:49.493
I will not consign these
people to despair, sir,

14:50.158 --> 14:52.268
nor to sickness.

14:58.615 --> 15:01.215
We have separated the children's infirmary

15:01.241 --> 15:06.964
from the rest of the workhouse,
er, a kind of cordon sanitaire.

15:06.965 --> 15:10.798
We must take the spread of disease
very seriously, even ringworm.

15:18.503 --> 15:20.962
And this, what is this place?

15:20.988 --> 15:24.572
The casual ward for tramps and vagrants,

15:24.598 --> 15:26.359
those who stay only one night.

15:26.385 --> 15:29.265
We're obliged to feed and water them
and let them return to the streets.

15:29.291 --> 15:31.218
We are, as you see, in the
process of fumigating it,

15:31.244 --> 15:33.659
for they bring the filth
of the world with them.

15:33.975 --> 15:37.206
Salus populi suprema est Lex.

15:37.535 --> 15:40.376
The health of the people
is the highest law. Indeed.

15:40.995 --> 15:44.106
But I believe you are no
stranger to this place, Mr. Reid.

15:44.132 --> 15:45.834
For was it not in a mortuary here to which

15:45.835 --> 15:47.511
Mary Ann Nichols was brought?

15:48.125 --> 15:49.664
The Ripper's first?

15:50.495 --> 15:51.902
Yes, it was.

15:52.335 --> 15:54.455
Evil place, old Montague Street.

15:54.795 --> 15:57.884
I hope you'll agree that the workhouse
has much changed since you knew it.

15:57.885 --> 15:59.997
It is indeed a marvel of
order and hygiene, which

16:00.023 --> 16:02.486
leads me to wonder, sir,
why Tommy Riggs should wish

16:02.512 --> 16:04.198
to run away from such a place.

16:04.905 --> 16:07.584
Pauper spirit, Inspector Reid.

16:07.982 --> 16:11.497
The spirit of the streets, it
is... it is too strong in some.

16:11.965 --> 16:14.034
They insist upon their freedom.

16:14.344 --> 16:16.875
His mother blames the
workhouse for his demise.

16:17.043 --> 16:18.436
What say you to that?

16:18.785 --> 16:20.205
His mother?

16:21.535 --> 16:22.744
Why, sir, that cannot be.

16:22.745 --> 16:25.774
- How so?
- His mother is dead.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.064
It is braided from my
hair for remembrance of me.

16:48.705 --> 16:50.676
And they had us make
them for our loved ones

16:50.702 --> 16:52.357
that they might share their mourning.

16:54.987 --> 16:57.805
Jesus, he's English.

17:08.805 --> 17:11.715
And I'll grieve for you
every hour, on the hour.

17:13.226 --> 17:18.442
And you, oh my Caitlin,

17:20.517 --> 17:22.580
you will be watchful.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.281
You will be vigilant.

17:24.807 --> 17:26.994
You will stay within
the bounds of this place,

17:27.021 --> 17:30.761
within these walls, and you will
show yourself to none but Croker.

17:31.488 --> 17:32.981
Promise me.

17:33.384 --> 17:34.882
I promise.

17:36.255 --> 17:41.774
I shall be close, and
silent, and invisible.

17:43.565 --> 17:48.051
And for that, Matthew, you
must stay away from our boy.

17:48.975 --> 17:50.644
You made a promise to Drake.

17:50.645 --> 17:54.671
You must keep that promise,
lest you ruffle his feathers.

17:56.215 --> 17:57.786
For they'll not trouble us here.

18:09.085 --> 18:11.150
I see you, American.

18:12.355 --> 18:14.994
Heart heavy to part with her, eh?

18:15.615 --> 18:17.154
Do not fear, sir.

18:17.155 --> 18:19.636
She will not want for company here.

18:28.472 --> 18:29.672
Sergeant.

18:29.941 --> 18:32.158
Ah, Mr. Reid, sir, I've been
seeking word of the coster.

18:32.184 --> 18:34.104
Yes, yes, yes, the
woman, the grieving woman.

18:34.105 --> 18:35.905
- She's gone, sir.
- She's gone?

18:35.931 --> 18:37.504
She packed up suddenly, lit out.

18:37.968 --> 18:39.228
Should I have held her, sir?

18:39.254 --> 18:41.668
No, no, you couldn't have known.
She's not the boy's mother.

18:41.694 --> 18:43.124
Boy's mother is dead.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.925
She left no word, she gave no
sign, no clue to her identity?

18:46.951 --> 18:48.356
Indeed, sir.

18:49.245 --> 18:50.686
It was found in the waiting room.

18:54.335 --> 18:57.056
Bromide of potassium. Grease paint.

18:57.082 --> 18:59.835
She treads the boards. I
know how she may be found.

18:59.861 --> 19:01.341
Sir, about the oyster seller.

19:01.477 --> 19:04.379
I found three stalls on Hanberry Street,
Midas Square, and Middlesex Street.

19:04.381 --> 19:06.503
Middlesex Street, trader there some years

19:06.529 --> 19:09.351
ago charged with several
accounts of violent fray. Ah...

19:10.402 --> 19:12.666
Orton, Orton, his name.
This may be his son.

19:12.692 --> 19:14.609
Seek him in the archives.
Learn what you can of him.

19:14.635 --> 19:17.184
And I would have an autopsy
done on this boy, Tommy,

19:17.185 --> 19:19.994
though I do not imagine Captain
Jackson is of a mind to work.

19:19.995 --> 19:22.047
On the contrary, Mr. Reid.

19:23.433 --> 19:25.992
Work is my mind's only refuge,

19:26.801 --> 19:29.151
after the old oak smoke, that is.

19:32.745 --> 19:34.108
Captain.

19:37.671 --> 19:38.871
Captain.

19:41.959 --> 19:43.693
You are not expected here.

19:44.505 --> 19:45.744
Go home, man.

19:45.745 --> 19:48.311
Riot victim, straight to the morgue, boys.

19:49.065 --> 19:50.576
But it would seem I am needed.

19:55.940 --> 19:57.271
Blessed murder.

20:03.344 --> 20:05.776
What's the case, Sergeant Drummond?

20:06.175 --> 20:08.247
This riot we've had the
Salvation Army shelters.

20:08.273 --> 20:09.791
The Salvations are again set upon,

20:09.817 --> 20:12.755
and the captain is now dead,
murdered, and strung up.

20:20.095 --> 20:23.834
Captain Solomon Shaw, stabbed
in the guts multiple times,

20:23.835 --> 20:27.194
head sheared, strung up like
a piece of meat for all to see.

20:27.401 --> 20:28.604
A statement.

20:28.605 --> 20:30.572
This is the work of the Skeleton Army.

20:32.075 --> 20:33.944
It's a ragtag army of the poor.

20:33.945 --> 20:37.264
They've risen against the Salvationists
and their so-called charity.

20:38.287 --> 20:40.536
Jesus, that's some kind of frenzy, huh?

20:41.529 --> 20:42.729
Nuts.

20:42.755 --> 20:45.821
Mr. Reid, who's this boy in our morgue?

20:46.355 --> 20:48.843
Tommy Riggs, workhouse runway.

20:49.145 --> 20:51.029
I would request an autopsy.

20:51.225 --> 20:53.464
I'm concerned it is
negligence caused his death.

20:53.490 --> 20:55.834
Well, you can see the work
waiting to be done here.

20:55.835 --> 20:57.827
You will get your autopsy, Inspector Reid,

20:57.853 --> 20:59.799
but we have a murder must be solved first.

21:06.885 --> 21:08.212
Thank you, Mr. Reid.

21:11.165 --> 21:12.813
These are double wounds.

21:13.325 --> 21:15.977
My guess is blades of some kind of shears.

21:16.495 --> 21:18.384
See the lateral splits in the wound,

21:18.410 --> 21:21.500
most likely the impact of the
hinge as the shears hit the flesh.

21:43.755 --> 21:46.113
Mrs. Drake, I wonder if you
might be able to help me.

21:46.545 --> 21:48.780
Ah, I seek to discover
the identity of a woman

21:48.806 --> 21:50.457
who came to me and has since disappeared.

21:50.483 --> 21:52.839
She is, er, I believe a fellow performer,

21:52.865 --> 21:54.389
an actress or a singer.

21:54.415 --> 21:55.995
She's dark, perhaps your height.

21:56.021 --> 21:57.639
She left this.

21:58.185 --> 21:59.385
Recognise it?

21:59.535 --> 22:02.365
There is a handkerchief.

22:02.793 --> 22:05.139
- It's embroidered with a swan.
- Um...

22:05.165 --> 22:08.134
She wears a cluster of flowers in her hair.

22:09.085 --> 22:10.698
Leda Starling.

22:11.405 --> 22:14.725
She had a spot at Blewett's for
a while, but they let her go.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.023
Last I heard, she was
singing for her supper

22:17.049 --> 22:18.436
at the Four Knives.

22:19.808 --> 22:21.274
Come on, Connor.

22:25.325 --> 22:27.613
He will eat for Bennet, but not for me.

22:28.445 --> 22:31.389
Smile for Bennet, sleep for Bennet.

22:33.625 --> 22:35.138
What am I to do with him?

22:35.164 --> 22:37.344
Well, you are grieving, both,

22:38.235 --> 22:40.033
it is only to be expected.

22:42.145 --> 22:44.453
It's good to see you again, Mr. Reid.

22:46.245 --> 22:47.670
Who is that now?

22:53.522 --> 22:55.066
Augustus.

22:55.645 --> 22:57.044
Hello, old friend.

23:03.349 --> 23:04.549
Oh.

23:04.575 --> 23:06.112
Commissioner Dove.

23:06.245 --> 23:09.074
Er, Augustus and I were at
the ragged school together.

23:09.075 --> 23:11.224
He taught me to write the perfect R.

23:11.626 --> 23:15.001
But Augustus, I don't doubt
you've met Inspector Edmund Reid.

23:15.027 --> 23:17.194
- Indeed, I have not.
- Sir.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.924
The honour is mine, Mr. Reid.

23:18.925 --> 23:20.958
White Chapel rejoices at your return.

23:20.984 --> 23:22.184
Hmm.

23:26.076 --> 23:31.916
♪ Shall we never meet again, luv, ♪

23:32.210 --> 23:37.152
♪ As we used to in the past? ♪

23:37.815 --> 23:43.596

24:22.807 --> 24:24.187
Ah, thank you.

24:29.132 --> 24:30.676
- Thank you.
- Madame.

24:31.895 --> 24:33.483
You do not remember me?

24:34.647 --> 24:37.444
I'm Inspector Reid from the
police station at Lehman Street.

24:37.445 --> 24:39.187
You are Leda Starling.

24:39.198 --> 24:40.654
This is yours, is it not?

24:41.165 --> 24:44.170
Oh, er, you must excuse me, sir.

24:44.181 --> 24:47.031
I am, as you can see, a
little mops and brooms.

24:47.042 --> 24:49.542
There was a boy. You came to see him.

24:49.675 --> 24:51.794
No, he was not my boy.

24:51.795 --> 24:53.192
Madame, you must explain yourself.

24:53.203 --> 24:56.624
You had me believe that you were
the mother of the boy in my morgue.

24:56.625 --> 24:59.724
No, I am the mother of a boy who is lost.

24:59.935 --> 25:01.443
How is he lost?

25:04.225 --> 25:05.812
I gave him up.

25:05.986 --> 25:07.193
God bless him.

25:07.204 --> 25:10.289
Er, I would have kept him, but
you see what I'm reduced to.

25:11.348 --> 25:14.287
So I put him in the workhouse.

25:14.995 --> 25:17.384
Oh God, what has become of him?

25:18.038 --> 25:20.154
Do you believe some harm has come to him?

25:20.155 --> 25:22.984
- Sir, I do fear it.
- In the workhouse?

25:23.095 --> 25:24.943
It's a fearful dark place.

25:24.954 --> 25:28.744
But they say he's not there, but if he
were not there, he would be here with me.

25:28.895 --> 25:30.574
Where else in the world could he be?

25:30.575 --> 25:33.567
Shall we not go there, get
to the heart of this matter?

25:35.115 --> 25:36.501
And find my boy?

26:08.733 --> 26:11.047
The master is not in his
office, sir, at present.

26:11.285 --> 26:12.694
Then find him.

26:12.695 --> 26:14.458
I'm here for a boy, Starling.

26:14.469 --> 26:15.861
What's his Christian name?

26:24.710 --> 26:25.910
Um...

26:37.435 --> 26:38.914
My boy.

26:38.915 --> 26:40.394
My boy.

26:40.395 --> 26:41.623
Ma?

26:42.865 --> 26:43.855
Yes.

26:43.856 --> 26:45.834
Yes, your ma's here.

26:45.835 --> 26:47.921
- Come to me. My boy.
- Ma!

26:54.255 --> 26:56.207
No, you're... you're not my boy.

27:00.885 --> 27:02.777
This... this is my boy.

27:02.788 --> 27:04.334
Come to your ma now.

27:04.335 --> 27:05.664
Are you my ma?

27:07.936 --> 27:09.868
Ms. Starling, you must come away now.

27:12.995 --> 27:15.276
What is this now? Please remove her.

27:15.287 --> 27:16.844
She is disturbing the children.

27:17.632 --> 27:19.101
I know I left him.

27:19.112 --> 27:20.605
I know I left him.

27:20.606 --> 27:21.806
My office, if you please.

27:25.005 --> 27:26.682
She seeks her son.

27:26.693 --> 27:28.069
She is much distressed.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.634
Inspector Reid, is this woman the
origin and cause of your earlier visit?

27:31.953 --> 27:34.294
For you must understand,
sir, she is deranged.

27:34.295 --> 27:35.677
Do you not see?

27:36.035 --> 27:37.497
She has lost her wits.

27:37.804 --> 27:40.101
I do not doubt that it was she claiming
to be the mother of Tommy Riggs.

27:40.112 --> 27:41.527
She is distracted. I own.

27:41.538 --> 27:43.529
But she is driven to it
by the absence of her son.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.147
And I grieve for her, but she comes

27:45.158 --> 27:48.066
here twice, often three times
in a week, to ask after him.

27:48.285 --> 27:50.749
And every time, I must tell
her that she is mistaken.

27:51.025 --> 27:52.793
We have no knowledge of her son.

27:52.804 --> 27:55.041
He has never been an inmate here.

27:55.421 --> 27:57.674
I cannot help her.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.645
It is a harsh truth, I understand.

27:59.845 --> 28:04.129
But these incursions into my
children's peace must stop.

28:04.645 --> 28:06.503
She is unwell, sir.

28:07.445 --> 28:09.408
Provision must be made for her.

28:11.845 --> 28:14.524
- I will call the Marland Asylum.
- No, no.

28:14.789 --> 28:17.732
No, do not trouble yourself. I
will see that she's taken care of.

28:18.390 --> 28:19.590
Very well.

28:27.637 --> 28:30.831
- Will you take me away from this place?
- Yes.

28:31.356 --> 28:32.867
- Come.
- Please.

28:33.855 --> 28:36.739
I see now, Inspector Reid, how it
is that you take such an interest.

28:39.283 --> 28:41.009
You insinuate, sir?

28:41.145 --> 28:44.530
I merely remark that it is not a
criminal case you pursue here, is it?

28:45.541 --> 28:48.707
I do not doubt you have more
pressing police matters to attend to.

28:54.845 --> 28:57.531
I have something for it. Take one more.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.502
Loss of short term memory,
neurasthenia, insomnia.

29:18.513 --> 29:20.796
She's taken bromide of potassium.

29:22.164 --> 29:23.963
Tertiary syphilis.

29:25.435 --> 29:26.944
It's in her brain.

29:27.357 --> 29:29.426
At one moment, she'll be lucid, rational.

29:29.437 --> 29:33.138
The next, she'll be scattered,
maniacal, bewildered.

29:33.445 --> 29:35.451
The asylum's her only future now.

29:35.462 --> 29:37.362
Dear God. What a road.

29:37.373 --> 29:38.856
What sanctuary is that?

29:40.801 --> 29:43.482
I will take her home for tonight. Ah...

29:43.769 --> 29:45.769
She needs rest, and I would
know more of this story

29:45.780 --> 29:47.171
of her boy and how he is missing.

29:47.182 --> 29:48.934
And perhaps she will be
calmer when she has rested.

29:48.946 --> 29:51.321
- Perhaps she will remember more.
- You cannot take her home, Reid.

29:51.332 --> 29:54.466
She is suffering the general
paresis of the insane.

29:54.477 --> 29:57.561
For that I will find
someplace for her tomorrow,

29:57.572 --> 29:58.879
somewhere better.

30:00.745 --> 30:02.583
She's not your concern.

30:15.434 --> 30:16.957
Morning, ladies.

30:16.968 --> 30:19.466
Drake Carter, otherwise
known as Redskin Jake,

30:19.477 --> 30:22.710
chief of the Skeleton Army, and
soon to be convicted of the murder

30:22.721 --> 30:23.977
of Captain Solomon Shaw.

30:23.988 --> 30:27.177
Caught him trying to shear a Salvation
Army lad with these little beauties.

30:27.313 --> 30:29.204
It's the black cap for
you, my friend. Come on.

30:29.205 --> 30:32.885
Hallelujah. Look at him now. He's a proper
little workhouse boy, ain't you, lad?

30:32.896 --> 30:34.346
Come here to my sergeant.

30:34.777 --> 30:36.902
- Can you tell me what happened?
- Wilfred Higgins...

30:37.721 --> 30:39.304
That man, he grabbed me...

30:39.315 --> 30:41.057
You sheared this boy.

30:42.315 --> 30:44.730
I have two other such
assaults, or am I wrong?

30:44.855 --> 30:46.758
This is your practise, is it not?

30:47.295 --> 30:49.048
Explain yourself.

30:50.259 --> 30:52.162
Ah, I was teaching him a lesson.

30:54.037 --> 30:56.640
You ever had a Salvation Army breakfast?

30:56.845 --> 30:58.484
'Cause they make you beg for it.

30:58.485 --> 31:00.524
I've had many a Salvation breakfast.

31:00.525 --> 31:02.313
Never once was I made to beg.

31:02.655 --> 31:05.839
Good people, merciful, who filled my belly,

31:05.850 --> 31:08.124
and I was glad of it, grateful.

31:08.135 --> 31:10.854
They want your soul in return.

31:12.853 --> 31:14.703
'Cause that ain't charity.

31:15.195 --> 31:18.179
A bone to the dog is not charity.

31:18.525 --> 31:22.625
Charity is a bone shared with a dog when

31:22.636 --> 31:25.034
you are as hungry as the dog.

31:25.525 --> 31:31.430
I sheared the boy just to
show he's one of us, human.

31:31.765 --> 31:34.395
And for that, you sheared
Solomon Shaw and all.

31:35.745 --> 31:37.615
It was not for this you killed him.

31:38.295 --> 31:40.931
He came upon your territory, threatened

31:40.942 --> 31:43.624
your criminal dominion, and
you made him answer for it.

31:43.625 --> 31:45.758
Stabbed him in the guts and strung him up.

31:45.769 --> 31:47.768
Do you think me stupid?

31:48.588 --> 31:52.590
I began my days in a prison, a workhouse?

31:53.018 --> 31:55.653
What? Do you think I meant to
end them, locked up and all?

31:55.825 --> 32:01.803
We, the Skeleton Army, are
the army of the free poor.

32:02.295 --> 32:05.698
We've known the pauper's punishments.

32:05.736 --> 32:09.244
You may leave, but if you're worthy,

32:09.245 --> 32:12.680
you may live, if you're deserving.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.019
We defy 'em.

32:15.030 --> 32:17.697
We will live as we choose,

32:17.698 --> 32:19.990
- without shame of our poverty,
- _

32:20.001 --> 32:21.565
- without apology!
- _

32:21.975 --> 32:25.104
Beef, good beef!

32:25.105 --> 32:28.333
Beer, good beer!

32:28.344 --> 32:30.918
- Banger!
- Shut your noise!

32:33.406 --> 32:34.606
Yes, miss?

32:34.617 --> 32:36.594
I'm here to help Mrs. Starling home.

32:37.393 --> 32:40.945
Ms. Reid, oh, good evening.

32:43.255 --> 32:45.745
Ms. Reid, how do you do?

32:45.756 --> 32:47.521
Good evening, Captain Jackson.

32:52.935 --> 32:54.458
Oh, erm...

32:56.156 --> 32:58.724
young Mr. Drummond,
you... you wanted some more

32:58.735 --> 33:00.786
of my miraculous beard serum.

33:00.797 --> 33:03.644
I do believe, though, I must say you, ah...

33:03.876 --> 33:08.131
you do me credit with
that, er, fine animal.

33:14.585 --> 33:16.364
Don't you drink that all at once.

33:16.365 --> 33:17.980
Mathilda, come.

33:35.695 --> 33:38.319
There is soup, should you be hungry later.

33:39.215 --> 33:41.635
Thank you for this care of
her. It's only for tonight.

33:42.136 --> 33:44.451
Tomorrow, we'll find the
right and proper place for her.

34:01.645 --> 34:04.200
Inspector Drake, given the late hour,

34:04.211 --> 34:06.159
I assume this is not a social call.

34:06.745 --> 34:08.011
It is not.

34:12.371 --> 34:13.873
Oh, I think you know it.

34:14.445 --> 34:15.975
You overstepped the mark.

34:17.025 --> 34:19.623
And I cannot help but
wonder why this is so.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.172
When I ask you to pursue one task for me,

34:22.184 --> 34:24.289
this amputating costermonger,

34:25.088 --> 34:27.915
yet I must find you
inventing quite another,

34:28.502 --> 34:31.784
a bewildered actress and
her imaginary lost son.

34:32.995 --> 34:34.907
The coster, I have him.

34:35.815 --> 34:37.393
His name... Percy Orton.

34:37.395 --> 34:39.481
Sells oysters from a
stall on Middlesex Street,

34:39.492 --> 34:41.504
as his father did before him, his father

34:41.505 --> 34:45.083
convicted of the severing of
a hand some 20 years since.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.324
The son continues the tradition.

34:49.505 --> 34:53.928
Ah, now, you see, that is why I need you.

34:53.938 --> 34:57.217
Inspector Drake, I do not
act in opposition to you.

34:57.543 --> 34:59.009
I mean no disrespect.

34:59.020 --> 35:02.225
It is... it is only my
doggedness that drives me.

35:02.236 --> 35:04.057
I think you know that well enough.

35:04.593 --> 35:08.273
Oh, I know that, Edmund Reid.

35:11.015 --> 35:13.618
What of this lady, hmm?

35:13.629 --> 35:15.259
This Leda Starling?

35:15.505 --> 35:17.576
Jackson tells me you've brought her home.

35:17.587 --> 35:20.374
And no doubt that I've lost
my judgement in this matter.

35:20.951 --> 35:24.743
But she is ill, And she
will be given proper care,

35:24.754 --> 35:27.010
but first she must rest so that I might

35:27.021 --> 35:29.029
pursue my inquiries of her.

35:30.341 --> 35:32.286
And these inquiries are?

35:33.035 --> 35:34.606
She's lost her son.

35:34.975 --> 35:36.887
She says that in dire straits, she

35:36.898 --> 35:39.534
gave him up to the union workhouse,
but he has since gone missing.

35:39.535 --> 35:41.277
She haunts the union for news of him,

35:41.288 --> 35:43.570
but the master there claims
no knowledge of the boy.

35:44.286 --> 35:47.452
But she is, is she not, in the
grip of some kind of dementia?

35:47.463 --> 35:49.235
There is some unravelling of the mind, yes,

35:49.246 --> 35:51.988
but why make up this story of the workhouse

35:51.999 --> 35:54.037
if it were not so? Why haunt the place?

35:54.175 --> 35:56.061
Some instinct drives her there.

35:56.072 --> 35:59.115
This and the boy Tommy,
the workhouse runaway,

35:59.126 --> 36:02.802
I have some sense, a sickening thrum

36:02.813 --> 36:04.820
that there is some kind
of malice at work here.

36:04.831 --> 36:08.899
The master, this Cornelius
Wilde, he has a needling,

36:08.910 --> 36:11.843
deflecting way about him
that resists all inquiry.

36:12.355 --> 36:13.774
I wish to talk to the Redskin.

36:13.775 --> 36:17.008
He was a workhouse boy. I should like
to hear what he has to say of the place.

36:19.227 --> 36:22.468
I, ah, must say, Mr. Reid,
I have my doubts for this.

36:23.512 --> 36:27.399
Well, I fear this case is food
for the pigs with that many scraps.

36:27.925 --> 36:31.583
You are working on a say-so
of... forgive me... a lunatic.

36:32.375 --> 36:33.685
Workhouse boys?

36:33.696 --> 36:35.394
I mean, they run away every day.

36:35.405 --> 36:37.314
What is there to see in this?

36:37.315 --> 36:39.604
Your boy Tommy is dead.

36:39.903 --> 36:43.879
I grieve for him, but you
forget, this is Whitechapel.

36:44.487 --> 36:46.119
For all that we have done here, she

36:46.130 --> 36:48.345
is still the merciless bitch of the east.

36:48.465 --> 36:52.583
And it gives me to ask, what
possessed you to come back here?

36:59.635 --> 37:01.295
You've seen Hampton,

37:04.040 --> 37:05.630
the promenade,

37:06.620 --> 37:09.564
the Paris halls, the polite conversation

37:09.575 --> 37:11.502
amidst the tea cups.

37:11.735 --> 37:14.102
There is nothing of it that breathes.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.606
There is nothing of it
that is alive, and quick,

37:17.617 --> 37:19.514
and stinking, and bright.

37:19.515 --> 37:24.401
Whitechapel is life, in all
its wild and rotten splendour.

37:25.065 --> 37:27.920
Beside it, the rest of
the world seems a tomb.

37:29.645 --> 37:32.003
It is rotten and wild.

37:32.462 --> 37:35.179
It is heaving, and pitiless, and ignorant.

37:35.740 --> 37:38.150
And I have yet seen nowhere to match it.

37:40.335 --> 37:44.237
It is our heartland, Bennet Drake.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.583
It is our life's work, Edmund Reid.

38:04.004 --> 38:05.516
No. no!

38:06.738 --> 38:08.711
W... William.

38:09.464 --> 38:12.414
William? William, William.

38:12.415 --> 38:13.730
Leda.

38:14.395 --> 38:15.869
Where's William?

38:16.425 --> 38:17.943
William is your boy?

38:18.015 --> 38:20.405
Where's Barnabas? Where's William?

38:20.406 --> 38:22.631
Where's Barnabas? Where's William?

38:25.195 --> 38:27.574
Are they missing? Now
you must listen to me.

38:27.575 --> 38:30.512
My mind is so often clouded,
but it is clear now for a moment.

38:30.523 --> 38:31.724
Hear it, please.

38:31.725 --> 38:33.763
M-my little boy was afraid.

38:33.774 --> 38:36.616
His friend William and his
friend Barnabas, they disappeared.

38:36.627 --> 38:38.882
- Disappeared?
- From the house, from the workhouse.

38:38.893 --> 38:40.355
He was afraid for 'em.

38:40.545 --> 38:41.974
Well, I'm afraid.

38:41.975 --> 38:43.943
You do believe me, do you?

38:43.954 --> 38:45.297
Yes. Yes.

38:45.308 --> 38:47.613
O God, and now my boy's such another.

38:52.165 --> 38:55.087
You will find him for me, hmm?

38:55.098 --> 38:56.754
Say you will find him.

38:57.845 --> 39:01.669
If he be dead,

39:02.275 --> 39:05.855
I do not care who, or, why, or how.

39:06.155 --> 39:08.515
I do not even ask for justice.

39:08.685 --> 39:11.827
Only that my boy be not alone in the world,

39:12.035 --> 39:15.159
and forgotten, and unknown.

39:15.170 --> 39:18.076
I will find him. I vow it.

39:18.087 --> 39:19.690
I will find your child.

39:40.979 --> 39:42.578
Is she mad?

39:43.479 --> 39:46.018
She is on that path, yes.

39:47.185 --> 39:51.017
My mother, was she so?

39:57.115 --> 39:58.667
She was very like.

40:02.455 --> 40:04.248
I should not have brought her here.

40:04.259 --> 40:05.785
Leda, forgive me.

40:08.548 --> 40:11.816
I have wondered at it so
often, my mother's madness.

40:14.485 --> 40:16.994
I could not imagine it. I dared not.

40:19.858 --> 40:21.782
But I know it now.

40:21.915 --> 40:23.610
I have seen it.

40:26.335 --> 40:28.819
I am no longer so so afraid.

40:34.965 --> 40:38.578
And to have her here...

40:41.641 --> 40:43.960
It's almost to be near her again.

41:08.031 --> 41:10.429
You brought Lady Luck with you, sir.

41:11.127 --> 41:13.361
Ah, this winning is too easy.

41:14.690 --> 41:16.496
You mean to make me generous?

41:16.788 --> 41:19.086
You think me some feeble-headed girl

41:19.327 --> 41:23.123
- with her brains in her tits.
- No, sir. No, indeed.

41:24.345 --> 41:28.189
I will give the job, the man
who offers me the best price.

41:28.278 --> 41:31.577
For three, four... we'll
do it for half your fee.

41:36.950 --> 41:39.450
Well, then make yourself
useful, luv. I am dry.

41:39.709 --> 41:41.090
Not cripple, I think.

41:41.680 --> 41:43.477
There is the wine, and there are your legs.

41:48.711 --> 41:50.715
Now, forgive me, my dear.

41:51.424 --> 41:53.564
You have not been introduced.

42:15.344 --> 42:18.873
This is... Jenny.

42:19.590 --> 42:22.345
I bought her to pretty things up.

42:28.330 --> 42:29.599
How much?

42:35.107 --> 42:36.921
How long have you been waiting in dock,

42:36.932 --> 42:38.971
while you float around
for this cheap price?

42:39.867 --> 42:43.374
And all the while paying
in port fees and interest?

42:45.778 --> 42:47.529
What is interest on your cargo?

42:49.389 --> 42:51.745
It is not for this that
you are yet unloaded.

42:52.246 --> 42:55.239
It is not the best price that you seek.

42:55.477 --> 42:57.022
It is discretion.

42:59.230 --> 43:00.889
Clever, little whore.

43:01.949 --> 43:05.363
If you mean to do business with us,
you will learn to keep a civil tongue.

43:05.374 --> 43:07.276
Bo Nystrom?

43:07.806 --> 43:09.870
Yeah, you have a memorable name.

43:10.440 --> 43:13.684
You have not traded in the port
of London for many years, sir.

43:14.282 --> 43:17.396
Not since the steamship Gustovas
went down with all hands.

43:17.397 --> 43:21.131
An unwarranted wreck in a calm sea.

43:22.538 --> 43:28.045
Nevertheless, the insurance was
paid handsomely, fraudulently.

43:29.236 --> 43:34.664
Our friends at Lloyds would be interested
to know of your return to the London docks.

43:41.384 --> 43:42.999
These are our terms.

43:43.209 --> 43:46.126
The job is ours and no others.

43:46.248 --> 43:47.451
The price is double.

43:47.462 --> 43:51.375
And there is a premium
to pay for my silence.

43:56.530 --> 43:58.917
One minute and the offer is closed.

44:18.563 --> 44:23.661
If you betray me, I will
carve you like scrimshaw.

44:30.407 --> 44:32.534
Jenny's a wild cat.

44:53.715 --> 44:56.031
Inspector Reid, is it not?

44:56.777 --> 45:01.170
Ah, we've never met, but I feel I know you.

45:01.284 --> 45:03.457
Your name travels ahead, sir.

45:04.075 --> 45:05.516
My name is Castello.

45:05.517 --> 45:07.466
Castello of the Star.

45:08.067 --> 45:09.681
Yours travels too, miss.

45:09.692 --> 45:12.545
And who is this wonderful girl, this hair?

45:12.556 --> 45:13.883
I am Matilda Reid.

45:13.894 --> 45:16.690
Miss Castello, you have
some business with me?

45:16.846 --> 45:20.787
Er... your marvellous return to
us here, it is owed to the fate

45:20.798 --> 45:22.523
of Isaac Bloom, I understand.

45:22.524 --> 45:23.817
You understand how?

45:24.184 --> 45:25.443
We have a mutual friend.

45:25.444 --> 45:26.683
And who that?

45:26.684 --> 45:29.498
Deborah Gorn, of the
orphanage on Worcester Street.

45:29.751 --> 45:31.398
- Come, Matilda. We'll be late.
- She asks

45:31.409 --> 45:33.338
herself why it is you
have not sought her out

45:33.349 --> 45:36.599
since your return, wonders
if that return is motivated

45:36.610 --> 45:38.763
by the execution of
your other mutual friend

45:38.764 --> 45:42.201
Mr. Bloom, if the murder
of the rabbi Ratovski

45:42.212 --> 45:44.475
still occupies that restless mind of yours.

45:45.104 --> 45:47.413
As you know, that case is now closed.

45:47.424 --> 45:49.460
And yet so much of its detail still

45:49.471 --> 45:52.059
stands injuncted, withheld from the public

45:52.070 --> 45:54.555
by the unseen hand of police officialdom.

45:55.214 --> 45:56.492
Why is that, sir?

45:56.503 --> 45:58.938
If indeed that case is closed?

45:59.624 --> 46:01.923
Will you now leave us, Miss Castello?

46:01.924 --> 46:03.471
Or allow us to leave you?

46:04.574 --> 46:06.149
Be my guest, Mr. Reid.

46:07.754 --> 46:10.349
And a good day to you, Miss Matilda Reid.

46:24.510 --> 46:27.327
_

47:01.244 --> 47:03.253
Cornelius Wilde told me this boy

47:03.254 --> 47:04.843
had been missing for a week.

47:04.844 --> 47:08.117
Can a mere week out of the
workhouse reduce a child to this?

47:11.764 --> 47:13.515
Fingernails missing,

47:14.985 --> 47:17.433
sores in the mouth and the tongue.

47:17.974 --> 47:21.573
And this cracking about the
lips, that's severe dehydration.

47:21.574 --> 47:25.673
I'd say that's chronic in
nature, a matter of months.

47:25.674 --> 47:28.473
Then no more delay. An autopsy
must be done on this boy.

47:28.904 --> 47:31.251
Well, my work's done here anyway, so.

47:39.822 --> 47:43.084
Got a, er, fragment of
steel lodged in the vertebra.

47:45.034 --> 47:48.684
Broken blade. Redskin's your man.

47:55.784 --> 47:58.254
You wished to have
words with him, Mr. Reid.

47:58.945 --> 48:00.183
Do you come, then?

48:11.504 --> 48:13.812
Redskin Jake, murderer.

48:14.048 --> 48:15.361
These your shears.

48:15.372 --> 48:18.483
The missing piece found in
the backbone of Solomon Shaw.

48:18.484 --> 48:19.978
What say you now?

48:20.417 --> 48:21.637
We have you, boy.

48:21.648 --> 48:24.098
Your motive, sir, what
drove you to this act?

48:24.623 --> 48:31.507
My protest, my defiance against
the disposing of the poor.

48:32.154 --> 48:34.884
I charge you with the murder
of Captain Solomon Shaw.

48:34.895 --> 48:36.419
Inspector Drake, if I may.

48:40.484 --> 48:42.969
You were a workhouse boy, sir.

48:43.123 --> 48:45.502
Here is another fine institution.

48:48.059 --> 48:49.991
I should have killed him.

48:50.674 --> 48:54.234
The master, should have killed him first.

48:54.874 --> 48:57.996
For it is he that started
this pretty business,

48:58.824 --> 49:00.829
peddling the lives of the poor.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.833
This pretty business, expound it.

49:02.834 --> 49:06.886
Well, he shut down the casual
ward, pays the Salvation Army

49:06.897 --> 49:09.973
a penny a man for the
vagrants he now turns away.

49:09.984 --> 49:11.665
Shut down the casual ward when?

49:11.805 --> 49:14.121
- Two months since.
- There is a lie told.

49:14.141 --> 49:16.745
This Cornelius Wilde. He claims
he shut it for disinfection.

49:16.756 --> 49:21.085
It's cheaper to pay of these souls
at a penny a go, than to keep 'em.

49:22.989 --> 49:25.277
And he is managing his costs.

49:27.964 --> 49:30.524
Here are boys, one dead, three missing,

49:30.535 --> 49:33.433
and here is a man obsessed with his books,

49:33.444 --> 49:35.760
his accounts, disposing
of the casual wards.

49:35.771 --> 49:37.429
What else is he disposing of.

49:39.340 --> 49:41.793
Your name, these... these markings?

49:41.804 --> 49:43.223
I'm a Redskin and proud.

49:43.234 --> 49:46.866
A Redskin, these are the
infirmary boys shaved and painted.

49:46.877 --> 49:48.716
This is iodine.

49:48.924 --> 49:50.619
My badge of honour.

49:53.103 --> 49:57.196
You think the workhouse is
the lowest of the low, hmm?

49:58.004 --> 49:59.337
Wrong.

49:59.454 --> 50:02.288
It's the workhouse infirmary.

50:02.299 --> 50:03.553
That's the lowest.

50:03.564 --> 50:05.793
The sick and the weak.

50:06.016 --> 50:07.838
You're just a burden, ain't you,

50:08.769 --> 50:15.395
left to rot or better yet,

50:16.667 --> 50:19.300
they give you the old black potion.

50:19.644 --> 50:21.295
What is the black potion?

50:22.124 --> 50:23.514
Poison.

50:24.084 --> 50:26.352
This old black potion it is folklore.

50:26.363 --> 50:28.991
You ask at any workhouse,
you'll hear them talk of it.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.962
It is a pauper's myth.

50:42.815 --> 50:44.942
Scarring in the intestinal tract,

50:44.953 --> 50:46.824
severe bleeding in the lower intestine,

50:46.836 --> 50:49.643
dehydration, blood in the faeces.

50:49.644 --> 50:50.844
Caused by?

50:51.394 --> 50:53.787
Well, it's many possible causes, erm...

50:54.434 --> 50:58.564
excessive ingestion of iron or lead,
but equally it could be hog's cowhage.

50:58.575 --> 51:00.063
It's a savage son of a bitch.

51:00.064 --> 51:02.124
It's found in dust heaps and bad meat.

51:02.135 --> 51:04.950
You do not rule out that
Tommy Riggs was poisoned?

51:07.643 --> 51:09.641
- I do not.
- That's reason enough for me.

51:09.652 --> 51:11.635
Bring him in. Bring in Cornelius Wilde.

51:13.794 --> 51:16.867
We will not bring him in. We do
not have enough to justify it.

51:16.878 --> 51:19.553
We will go there. We will make
a full and thorough search.

51:19.564 --> 51:21.953
Then, I may at least take your reigns.

51:54.344 --> 51:56.743
Find Cornelius Wilde. Detain him here.

51:56.744 --> 51:59.607
Scour this place. Seek out any
hidden place, any locked cupboard.

51:59.618 --> 52:01.227
Bring me whatsoever you may find there.

52:03.484 --> 52:04.684
Do you see it?

52:04.976 --> 52:07.037
There's something inhuman here.

52:07.182 --> 52:09.922
All is neat and correct, orderly.

52:09.933 --> 52:11.932
This order, this marvellous efficiency,

52:11.943 --> 52:14.373
this systematisation,
I believe that here yet

52:14.374 --> 52:17.719
attends some unforeseen evil,
some coldness to humankind,

52:17.730 --> 52:19.481
some conscience lost.

52:29.177 --> 52:30.377
This way.

52:34.634 --> 52:36.026
What is this you give them?

52:36.171 --> 52:37.727
Cod liver oil, sir.

52:47.784 --> 52:50.600
- This?
- An outbreak of Scarlet Fever.

52:51.254 --> 52:52.625
You may not go in, sir.

52:52.636 --> 52:54.353
It's quarantined.

52:54.953 --> 52:57.976
Mr. Reid, it's quarantined.
You cannot go in there.

52:58.304 --> 53:00.934
Mr. Reid, you are going beyond here.

53:17.249 --> 53:18.750
Where to now?

53:18.761 --> 53:20.004
The casual ward.

53:20.015 --> 53:21.651
It was recently fumigated.

53:35.582 --> 53:37.286
Some poor kind of building work.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.899
Ceilings in the wrong place.

53:40.058 --> 53:41.696
Stinks of carbolic.

53:45.874 --> 53:49.438
Mr. Drake, sir, Cornelius Wilde is found.

53:53.283 --> 53:56.883
You see me here, Inspector
Drake, an innocent man shackled.

53:57.364 --> 53:58.935
You will not hear the end of this.

54:03.294 --> 54:04.943
Here is a man with a vision.

54:05.237 --> 54:08.647
He means to invest in his young inmates,

54:08.658 --> 54:10.643
teach them skills, build
them up ready for life.

54:10.654 --> 54:13.327
It's a worthy vision, but it costs money,

54:13.338 --> 54:16.418
a great deal of money, and
he has only limited resources.

54:17.098 --> 54:20.118
And we see here busy accounts indeed,

54:20.129 --> 54:22.897
money moved from here to there,
robbing Peter to pay Paul.

54:22.908 --> 54:25.015
You pay a small fee to the Salvation Army

54:25.026 --> 54:27.253
to rid yourself of the great
cost of the casual ward.

54:27.264 --> 54:28.793
There's nothing illegal in that.

54:28.794 --> 54:32.128
The casual ward was a drain on
my resources. I freely own it.

54:32.204 --> 54:35.563
These men, the-these loafer
paupers, they are the lazy,

54:35.574 --> 54:38.243
the indolent, the residual.

54:38.244 --> 54:39.616
They are irredeemable.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.876
Undeserving of sympathy, of
kindness, undeserving of life.

54:43.887 --> 54:46.209
Tommy Riggs, a boy in your care, and yet he

54:46.220 --> 54:48.863
died in abjection in my arms.

54:48.874 --> 54:50.377
Tommy Riggs ran away.

54:50.388 --> 54:52.099
Tommy Riggs escaped from you.

54:52.110 --> 54:54.066
He... he fled for his life!

54:54.077 --> 54:57.150
Mr. Reid, here is something you must see...

54:58.004 --> 55:00.054
the boy, Starling, marked here.

55:03.173 --> 55:04.629
Jabas Starling,

55:06.061 --> 55:07.463
lost to his mother.

55:08.264 --> 55:11.965
She dying of grief, and you
denied all knowledge of him.

55:13.394 --> 55:14.923
You denied her her boy.

55:14.924 --> 55:16.572
You told her she was mad.

55:16.724 --> 55:20.732
That woman... that woman, she...
she gave him up to the house.

55:20.743 --> 55:23.660
- She is a prostitute, a lunatic!
- You bluster, sir.

55:23.671 --> 55:25.022
You could not acknowledge him for you could

55:25.033 --> 55:26.623
not produce him. What
have you done with him?

55:26.634 --> 55:28.072
What have you done with him? How have you

55:28.083 --> 55:30.071
- disposed of him?
- Mr. Reid, Mr. Reid.

55:31.355 --> 55:33.609
I will find you out, sir.

55:34.764 --> 55:36.883
You've taken leave of
your senses, Mr. Reid.

55:36.884 --> 55:39.903
You accuse me of killing
the boys in my care!

55:39.904 --> 55:43.069
Inspector Drake, will you allow
this obsession, this... this mania?

55:43.081 --> 55:45.602
You stop your yapping now and be silent!

55:46.124 --> 55:48.333
The money from the casual ward then.

55:48.743 --> 55:51.594
Yes, here. You pay the salaries
of three school teachers,

55:51.605 --> 55:53.233
and yet you are still in the red!

55:53.234 --> 55:56.311
Now let me see. Where is the
greatest expenditure made?

55:56.322 --> 55:58.856
I will warrant it is in the infirmary,

56:00.445 --> 56:02.338
the children's infirmary.

56:05.704 --> 56:09.372
Costs full month-on-month
this last quarter.

56:09.442 --> 56:11.163
Says the children are dispatched.

56:11.164 --> 56:13.649
How much does a sick child cost, Mr. Wilde?

56:13.660 --> 56:15.892
How many do you need to be rid
of before you balance your books?

56:15.903 --> 56:19.462
Why would I want to kill my
boys when my only purpose is

56:19.473 --> 56:21.082
to give them life?

56:22.171 --> 56:24.203
A locked cabinet, Mr. Reid.

56:24.204 --> 56:26.667
Inside, these.

56:26.974 --> 56:30.458
Blaud pills, treatment of
anaemia, sulphate of iron.

56:30.469 --> 56:33.553
Huge cupboard, full of
them. Hundreds of bottles.

56:33.564 --> 56:36.672
Tommy Riggs died from scarring
of the intestinal tract

56:36.683 --> 56:41.162
and dehydration caused by the
excessive ingestion of iron.

56:43.955 --> 56:45.484
He's killing the sick.

56:46.138 --> 56:48.033
For it's cheaper than keeping 'em.

56:48.896 --> 56:50.992
Dear God, he is killing children.

56:52.976 --> 56:55.855
Tommy Riggs ran away.

56:56.905 --> 56:59.970
Jabas Starling ran away.

57:01.164 --> 57:03.504
Inspector Reid has
taken leave of his senses

57:03.515 --> 57:04.894
not for the first time.

57:13.548 --> 57:14.748
Deaths.

57:22.314 --> 57:23.514
They are not marked here.

57:23.525 --> 57:26.120
He is not taking them to the
pits, or he must document them.

57:26.131 --> 57:27.331
Where's he putting them?

57:29.614 --> 57:31.035
The casual ward.

57:32.684 --> 57:34.813
It was not the ceiling there was too low.

57:34.814 --> 57:36.712
It was the floor. It was too high.

58:26.717 --> 58:28.078
Sweet Jesus.

58:36.924 --> 58:40.652
You will dig up every
single one of these boys

58:40.663 --> 58:43.062
that you have buried, and
you will identify them!

58:43.244 --> 58:47.850
You will identify this boy, or
you will join him in the earth!

58:48.989 --> 58:51.398
This, Jabas Starling,

58:52.798 --> 58:55.563
you... you... you do not understand.

58:55.564 --> 58:57.563
You cannot.

58:57.564 --> 59:04.153
This place, the waste of life,
it is... it is intolerable.

59:04.154 --> 59:08.322
This... this... this boy... this Jabas,

59:08.994 --> 59:13.583
himself blighted with syphilis, his mother

59:13.584 --> 59:17.546
deranged, his... his father absent.

59:17.557 --> 59:20.273
There... there is no hope for him,

59:20.274 --> 59:24.885
only poverty and degradation.

59:25.324 --> 59:30.363
These... these... these
others, polio, rickets.

59:30.904 --> 59:34.040
I only hasten the inevitable.

59:34.854 --> 59:37.503
And there is... there is a kindness in it.

59:37.504 --> 59:39.833
There is a kindness in it for them.

59:39.834 --> 59:47.169
Their sufferings, their
pitiful lives are shortened.

59:47.794 --> 59:51.000
These useless boys,

59:53.032 --> 59:55.999
I have given a hundred children,

59:56.010 --> 01:00:00.898
a hundred children, the
start in life they deserve.

01:00:04.404 --> 01:00:07.152
At what cost, hmm?

01:00:08.334 --> 01:00:13.073
Deserving poor, the undeserving
poor, who are you to judge?

01:00:38.794 --> 01:00:39.994
Connor.

01:00:43.274 --> 01:00:44.474
Come.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.684
Come.

01:00:54.073 --> 01:00:56.265
Connor, calm yourself.

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:58.636
Rose.

01:01:03.244 --> 01:01:04.979
All day it is like this.

01:01:05.419 --> 01:01:07.317
He will have nothing of me.

01:01:08.624 --> 01:01:11.093
Why don't you quit your
fooling, little man?

01:01:11.104 --> 01:01:12.304
Huh?

01:01:14.684 --> 01:01:16.558
You gotta behave...

01:01:17.522 --> 01:01:18.994
for your mum.

01:01:30.835 --> 01:01:37.833
♪ Little girl, little
girl, don't you lie to me. ♪

01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:43.660
♪ Tell me where did you sleep last night? ♪

01:01:45.014 --> 01:01:51.350
♪ In the pines, in the pines,
where the sun never shines, ♪

01:01:52.138 --> 01:01:54.229
♪ Shiver. ♪

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.211
The only kind of song I know.

01:02:01.141 --> 01:02:02.341
W...

01:02:03.204 --> 01:02:05.156
You will come see him again.

01:02:06.740 --> 01:02:08.796
You have him under your spell.

01:02:10.212 --> 01:02:12.274
Say you'll come again, Jackson.

01:02:14.525 --> 01:02:17.220
I don't think Mr. Drake
will care for that very much.

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.320
Well,

01:02:21.278 --> 01:02:23.060
he need never know.

01:02:29.317 --> 01:02:31.741
Well, we won't tell him,
now will we, little man?

01:02:48.919 --> 01:02:51.726
Never let it be said
Abel Croker does not deal.

01:02:53.822 --> 01:02:55.942
Ah, forgive me, Madame.

01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:58.450
There are no ladies in my life down here,

01:02:58.461 --> 01:03:00.519
and my manners are rough. Huh?

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.700
There.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:08.815
Your share of the Viking
loot you won for me.

01:03:09.166 --> 01:03:11.213
- And this?
- Ha...

01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:15.183
Some graft for you, if you would.

01:03:15.764 --> 01:03:19.619
Tell me how my business stands,
for I confess it, I have lost count.

01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:21.812
There is every barrel, every spice,

01:03:21.823 --> 01:03:23.953
every last cotton bale of the Empire

01:03:23.954 --> 01:03:26.347
forgotten somewhere in here.

01:03:28.832 --> 01:03:30.032
Yeah?

01:03:42.784 --> 01:03:46.210
10 years past, my blood
would have roared for you.

01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:49.388
Proud, old lion you are now, though.

01:03:49.605 --> 01:03:52.983
Aye, but blunted claws.

01:04:17.707 --> 01:04:19.579
I lost my boy.

01:04:24.625 --> 01:04:26.980
I know where he lies.

01:04:28.204 --> 01:04:33.808
It's a bright spot beside
the trees, where birds sing.

01:04:39.516 --> 01:04:41.372
I know where he lies.

01:04:51.685 --> 01:04:53.838
Why do you weep, sir?

01:05:05.106 --> 01:05:07.344
The comfort you have for your son,

01:05:08.245 --> 01:05:10.643
I could not give to my wife.

01:05:11.697 --> 01:05:13.852
Our girl was lost to her forever.

01:05:15.684 --> 01:05:18.527
You're a good man, Mr. Reid.

01:05:18.538 --> 01:05:20.083
Do you not know it?

01:05:21.002 --> 01:05:23.141
You're a mighty heart.

01:05:32.979 --> 01:05:35.034
I lost my boy.

01:05:39.954 --> 01:05:42.263
But I know where he lies.

01:05:43.954 --> 01:05:46.211
Beside the trees,

01:05:46.827 --> 01:05:48.741
among the birds.

01:06:00.274 --> 01:06:01.863
Edmund Reid,
