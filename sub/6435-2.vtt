09:35.676 --> 09:37.576
MS. TUDI: 'Cause I don't
want to, that's why!
Yeah. Well...

09:37.578 --> 09:39.744
Hey. Hey, you hear that?
Hear what?

09:39.746 --> 09:43.882
That's why!
You're going too far.
That sound like Ms. Tudi.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.952
MS. TUDI: 'Cause I don't want
to, that's why!
JESUS: Shh!

09:46.954 --> 09:48.587
Ms. Tudi, keep your voice down.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.455
Why you acting all bougie
and shit, like you some kind

09:50.457 --> 09:52.924
of angel or something? How many
times I looked away with my holy

09:52.926 --> 09:55.460
and infinite gaze when you
was doing janky shit yourself?
Because it's wrong,

09:55.462 --> 09:58.096
that's why!
It's going too far.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.264
JESUS:
You don't do this for me,

09:59.266 --> 10:00.265
then I think you don't need

10:00.267 --> 10:01.633
Jesus in your life no more.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.568
MS. TUDI: Okay, I'll do it.
But don't you

10:03.570 --> 10:07.706
<i>ever</i> ask me to do anything
like this again. I mean it.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.275
JESUS:
Ms. Tudi, come back. Why you got
to be like that? Come here.

10:10.277 --> 10:13.078
(organ playing)
VIC:
<i>Yes, welcome, welcome.</i>

10:13.080 --> 10:15.880
Welcome. Welcome.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.550
Welcome. Welcome.
Welcome.

10:18.552 --> 10:21.786
Ah.
Well, well. What a
pleasant surprise.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.556
To what do I owe
the pleasure?
Good morning, Vic.

10:24.558 --> 10:27.559
I, um, just had a need
to hear the Word.

10:27.561 --> 10:30.261
A different word,
if you know what I mean.
Mm-hmm.

10:30.263 --> 10:34.132
That is, if a sinner
like me is welcome.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.067
Well, all are
welcome here.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.336
Especially you.
Oh.

10:38.338 --> 10:41.339
Let me escort you
to our VIP area.
Oh.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.575
Thank you, Vic.

10:43.577 --> 10:46.444
And then Jesus-- ugh, whatever
that nigga's real name is--

10:46.446 --> 10:48.346
he asked me
to do something, Vic,

10:48.348 --> 10:51.583
that I know Jesus would not ask
a person to do.

10:51.585 --> 10:54.352
Have a seat, Ms. Tudi.
Oh, thank you.

10:54.354 --> 10:57.422
<i>I heard that the pastor</i>

10:57.424 --> 10:59.124
will hold a private meeting

10:59.126 --> 11:01.259
with a potential donor.
Do you think

11:01.261 --> 11:05.296
that he might see me today
before the service starts?

11:05.298 --> 11:07.432
The pastor's kind of busy.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.201
I know, Vic, but, um...

11:10.203 --> 11:12.303
I need help from the real Jesus.

11:12.305 --> 11:14.773
And I brought my checkbook.

11:33.793 --> 11:37.062
Do they have activities here,
like, for, uh, singles?

11:37.064 --> 11:38.863
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.398
The reverend will see you now.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.567
Oh. All right.
Well, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.402
Hey, you know,
Ms. Tudi, uh,

11:44.404 --> 11:48.206
my uncle's kind of
old, okay, so he may

11:48.208 --> 11:50.308
say something that's
inappropriate,

11:50.310 --> 11:51.743
but don't take it personal.

11:51.745 --> 11:53.578
I'm a big girl, Vic.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.281
But thank you
for your concern.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.863
Ms. Tudi!

12:11.865 --> 12:15.400
My nephew tells me
that you were well-endowed

12:15.402 --> 12:17.435
with gifts from the Lord.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.672
But I see the Lord has
endowed you well, too.

12:20.674 --> 12:22.273
(laughing):
Oh.
(laughing)

12:22.275 --> 12:23.675
Stop it some more, Reverend.

12:23.677 --> 12:25.844
Oh, please
have a seat.
Okay.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.547
Uh,

12:29.549 --> 12:32.350
Vic, will you excuse us, please?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.586
Please.
Oh... yeah.

12:36.288 --> 12:38.223
So, I understand
you're looking

12:38.225 --> 12:40.759
to make a sizable donation
to the church.

12:40.761 --> 12:43.695
Oh, yes. Yes, Reverend,
and I was, um...

12:43.697 --> 12:45.964
Well, I was hoping
that you and I could also

12:45.966 --> 12:48.032
spend some personal time.

12:48.034 --> 12:52.804
You see, Reverend, I need some
private, spiritual counseling.

12:52.806 --> 12:55.073
Well, this can be arranged.
(laughing)

12:55.075 --> 12:56.775
Good.
(laughing)

12:56.777 --> 12:58.476
But, you know,

12:58.478 --> 13:03.047
Jesus would want you
to be relaxed.
Oh.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.482
♪ Hallelujah ♪

13:04.484 --> 13:06.918
Damn!
♪ Hallelujah ♪

13:06.920 --> 13:08.720
Uh, judge not
lest you be judged.

13:08.722 --> 13:10.555
♪ Hallelujah, hallelujah... ♪
(both laugh)

13:10.557 --> 13:13.324
I'll take this one. Well...
(loud knocking)

13:13.326 --> 13:15.226
Can't you wait for
a "Come in," nigga?!

13:15.228 --> 13:18.463
Uh, sorry, Rev. It's just that
it's five minutes to showtime.

13:18.465 --> 13:19.731
Nigga, I got a watch!
Uh-huh.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.633
Ms. Tudi, excuse me, will you?

13:21.635 --> 13:23.601
(laughing)

13:23.603 --> 13:26.004
I will be back...
after the show.

13:26.006 --> 13:29.474
But you, uh, feel free to
mix yourself another drink.

13:29.476 --> 13:31.342
Oh. Thank you, Reverend.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.011
Have a good service.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.579
Thank<i> you.</i>
(laughs)

13:34.581 --> 13:37.482
(clears her throat, laughs)

13:40.252 --> 13:44.756
Hey, Ms. Tudi, I don't think
that you should, uh, wait.

13:44.758 --> 13:47.492
You getting jealous, huh, Vic?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.928
No, no, I'm not jealous. I'm-I'm
just looking out for you.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.763
That's so sweet.<i> Oh!</i>
Oh, see?

13:51.765 --> 13:53.798
Oh!
See? That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.366
See? Put that drink down,
Ms. Tudi.

13:55.368 --> 13:56.968
You had enough. Yeah.
Yeah.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.938
Let me take you home, all right?
Okay, okay.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.105
(touch tone sounds)

14:01.107 --> 14:03.708
Hello. Hey, hey, listen, man,
I got something to do.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.443
I'm gonna be back
in time for the count.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.045
Thank you for taking care of me.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.513
Oh, think nothing of it.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.382
(organ plays)

14:14.987 --> 14:16.187
Yeah?
Oh.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.122
Oh.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.892
Whew! Mm-hmm.
(sighs)

14:20.894 --> 14:22.827
(groans)
Ooh!

14:22.829 --> 14:25.463
You mind if we just
sit here for a little bit?

14:25.465 --> 14:28.900
Okay.
Mmm. Mmm!

14:28.902 --> 14:30.468
(applause)

14:30.470 --> 14:31.870
MAN: Amen!
MAN 2:
Preacher! Preacher!

14:31.872 --> 14:33.705
REV. CLEVELAND:
A little boy came to me.

14:33.707 --> 14:38.176
He said, "Reverend, what does
God do with all that money?"

14:38.178 --> 14:39.644
I beat that little boy's ass,

14:39.646 --> 14:41.346
and I told him
to mind his business.

14:41.348 --> 14:43.147
(applause)
That's what I did.

14:43.149 --> 14:46.084
MAN: Yeah!
REV. CLEVELAND:
Dig in your pockets

14:46.086 --> 14:47.585
and give Jesus
what he deserves!

14:47.587 --> 14:49.654
He's your Lord and Savior.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.189
That's worth at least 90%.

14:51.191 --> 14:52.523
Jesus paid for your sins,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.893
and now he's come to collect.
Amen.

14:54.895 --> 14:57.195
And God has a warm
place for you niggas

14:57.197 --> 14:59.898
who try to hold out
on him in church.
(applause)

14:59.900 --> 15:01.666
Help!

15:01.668 --> 15:04.535
(coughing)
(people groaning,
cell cameras beep)

15:04.537 --> 15:05.904
(people groaning)

15:05.906 --> 15:07.906
What are you guys doing?
This man's having

15:07.908 --> 15:11.042
a heart attack. Somebody help!
(cell cameras clicking)

15:11.044 --> 15:12.844
Hey, man, y'all
some cold (bleep)!

15:12.846 --> 15:14.679
Man, don't you see
I'm having a heart attack!?

15:14.681 --> 15:16.714
Well, what?
(Boonie grunting)

15:16.716 --> 15:18.182
Yes, my uncle--
he's having a heart attack!

15:18.184 --> 15:20.418
Please send somebody.
(coughs)

15:20.420 --> 15:22.520
Okay, great!
Guys, listen, don't panic.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.355
<i>Help is on the way.</i>
<i>Paramedics are coming.</i>

15:24.357 --> 15:26.457
All right, guys, let's go.
We've got an emergency.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.693
Obviously, we
have a bit of a

15:28.695 --> 15:32.563
medical emergency, so, uh,
let-let us all pray, I guess...

15:32.565 --> 15:35.099
(audience murmuring loudly)
...for the... for the
fat brother on the floor.

15:35.101 --> 15:38.069
Everybody, move...
Obviously, this brother

15:38.071 --> 15:40.138
has never passed a
ham hock he didn't like.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.539
(Boonie groans)
Over here.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.942
BOONIE: Oh. (coughs)
BPs are dropping.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.144
We got to fill him
with phenobarbital.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.447
Pull back on the retractors.
Three, two, one.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.382
(Boonie groaning)
Whoa!

15:51.384 --> 15:52.483
MAN:
He's heavy.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.652
(overlapping chatter)

15:54.654 --> 15:56.654
(people gasp, groan, yell)

15:56.656 --> 15:57.989
For crying out loud!

15:57.991 --> 15:59.157
Okay, everybody look.

15:59.159 --> 16:01.125
We need to stabilize him first.

16:01.127 --> 16:03.828
Okay, everybody move.
We need to make room here.
Move.

16:03.830 --> 16:05.563
JASON:
Come on, everybody back up.

16:05.565 --> 16:06.965
We need room here.
We need room.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.967
'Cause we got to get
this guy to the back.

16:08.969 --> 16:11.102
Back up, everyone!
Wait! That area is off limits!

16:11.104 --> 16:14.205
James! James, go, go
in the back with them!

16:16.842 --> 16:20.812
Coming through, people.
Coming through!

16:20.814 --> 16:22.647
All right. Sir, we
have an emergency.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.449
This man is having
a heart attack!

16:24.451 --> 16:26.084
We need a room with
a big, flat table.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.419
What about this room? Is there
a flat table in this room?

16:28.421 --> 16:30.355
Ain't nobody allowed
in that room.
Sir, if he dies,

16:30.357 --> 16:32.023
you're gonna face
criminal charges--
are you willing

16:32.025 --> 16:33.758
to do that?
Hell, no.
I'm on parole.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.593
Then I suggest you
open that door quick.

16:35.595 --> 16:36.928
Give me the key.
Come on.

16:36.930 --> 16:39.330
Just hang in
there, sir.
(mumbling)

16:39.332 --> 16:41.032
Stay with us.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.369
Come this way.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.770
Medical personnel only.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.840
Pray for him, people.
(sobbing)

16:48.842 --> 16:51.609
You can't lock the door.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.312
(sobbing):
My, my uncle!

16:54.314 --> 16:56.881
(whispers):
Hurry up.

16:56.883 --> 16:58.116
(engine starts)

16:58.118 --> 16:59.584
(phone rings)

17:00.452 --> 17:01.819
Hello.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.322
I told you I had
something to...

17:04.324 --> 17:06.190
Emergency paramedics?

17:06.192 --> 17:09.560
Look... I told you
I had something to do.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.397
I will be back
in five minutes!

17:12.399 --> 17:14.232
Later.

17:14.234 --> 17:15.800
Is everything okay?

17:15.802 --> 17:17.702
Sound like some real
crazy shit is going on

17:17.704 --> 17:19.470
over there-- I don't
know what, you know...

17:19.472 --> 17:20.838
Vic, just...
(groans)

17:20.840 --> 17:23.307
Listen, I got something
I got to tell you.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.644
What's that?
But you got to promise you're
not gonna call the police.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.212
Come on, man.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.882
You got to know that's
something I would never do.

17:30.884 --> 17:33.251
Child, Jesus is
robbing the church.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.154
That goddamn con man!

17:36.156 --> 17:38.823
So I know even in church
sometimes shit hap...

17:38.825 --> 17:40.191
Wha...?

17:40.193 --> 17:41.926
(whispers inaudibly)

17:41.928 --> 17:44.262
Uh... pray!

17:49.034 --> 17:50.601
Hey!
Whoa!

17:50.603 --> 17:52.336
Hey! Hey!

17:52.338 --> 17:54.338
Nobody in the
money room!

17:54.340 --> 17:56.074
You can't be in there.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.709
(low grunting)
Go save that fat
nigga somewhere else!

17:58.711 --> 18:00.178
Open up this door!

18:00.180 --> 18:03.281
Hey, listen, go get the spare
key inside my, inside my office.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.550
Okay.
My uncle.
Please, please, pray...

18:05.552 --> 18:07.285
pray for my uncle! Please!

18:07.287 --> 18:09.120
Oh, get this nigga
off of me!

18:09.122 --> 18:10.922
Clear the way!
He's gonna be okay.

18:10.924 --> 18:13.191
I need 10cc's diazepam,
X-Y-Z right now.

18:13.193 --> 18:16.194
TRAYVON:
Thank you! Thank you so much!
Don't disturb him.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.596
We got to get
this man out of here.
Yeah, wait, wait, wait! Hey.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.100
Count that money.

18:22.102 --> 18:26.037
MAGGIE:
We got to defibrillate him the
moment we pull him off the wire.

18:26.039 --> 18:27.038
Aha! Caught!

18:27.040 --> 18:30.108
VIC: See, those ain't
no paramedics.

18:30.110 --> 18:32.310
That's the con man and
his cult of followers.

18:32.312 --> 18:33.878
What the hell?

18:33.880 --> 18:35.713
Yeah, Ms. Tudi told me
the whole plan.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.881
They just robbed
the collection.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.884
Yeah, she was supposed
to distract me

18:39.886 --> 18:40.885
so I didn't notice
these clowns.

18:40.887 --> 18:42.753
Ms. Tudi, you told Vic?!

18:42.755 --> 18:44.722
Bitch!
MS. TUDI:
Listen,

18:44.724 --> 18:47.225
I know I'm not always
the best influence--

18:47.227 --> 18:48.426
I know that--

18:48.428 --> 18:49.927
but this right here,

18:49.929 --> 18:51.629
robbing a church?
Come on, Jesus,

18:51.631 --> 18:53.231
this is crossing the line.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.265
Okay, look, look,

18:54.267 --> 18:55.399
we planned to rob
a church,

18:55.401 --> 18:56.400
I ain't gonna lie.

18:56.402 --> 18:57.502
But at the last minute,

18:57.504 --> 18:59.337
we couldn't do it.
I mean,

18:59.339 --> 19:00.671
Fish was right.
Hey, even though

19:00.673 --> 19:02.573
I don't like you
collecting money in my name,

19:02.575 --> 19:05.343
what could I say, man,
stealing is stealing.

19:05.345 --> 19:06.410
Ms. Tudi,

19:06.412 --> 19:07.912
Vic, Reverend,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.480
two wrongs
don't make a right.

19:09.482 --> 19:10.848
We didn't steal your money.

19:10.850 --> 19:13.184
It's all there--
go ahead and count it.

19:13.186 --> 19:13.951
Jesus...

19:13.953 --> 19:15.286
I'm proud of you.

19:15.288 --> 19:17.855
REV. CLEVELAND:
Come on. Come in here.

19:17.857 --> 19:19.624
Search 'em.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.592
Get up in their ass
like the airport.

19:21.594 --> 19:24.195
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

19:24.197 --> 19:26.664
Go check that
camera footage.
Okay.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.001
Five thousand

19:30.003 --> 19:31.802
four hundred
and thirty-two dollars

19:31.804 --> 19:34.172
and forty-three cents.
That's all?

19:34.174 --> 19:36.174
That's actually the best
week we had all year.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.877
But there could've been more.
I bet there was more.

19:39.879 --> 19:42.146
Wow. Would there be more,
Reverend?

19:42.148 --> 19:43.447
Hmm.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.716
Uh, listen, why don't you
let the boys go, huh?

19:45.718 --> 19:47.485
I mean, we don't want
to call the police

19:47.487 --> 19:50.354
and have them snooping
in little places.
REV. CLEVELAND: No, no, no,

19:50.356 --> 19:53.157
no, no, we don't want no police.
MS. TUDI: Yeah.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.693
(sighs)
All right, let 'em go.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.796
But Jesus is gonna get his.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.398
Oh, yeah.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.300
I think Jesus already did.

20:02.302 --> 20:05.303
(Jesus chuckling)

20:05.305 --> 20:06.837
Nigga, you need
to go wash your feet.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.040
And don't come back
here no more.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.842
We got nothing on the cam.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.212
The Wi-Fi went out
same time as usual.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.479
(exhales, mumbles)

20:15.481 --> 20:17.882
What happened to that skinny
little crying nigga?

20:17.884 --> 20:19.550
Get this nigga off of me!

20:19.552 --> 20:21.152
Open the door!
Out of the way!

20:21.154 --> 20:23.487
Clear the way!
He's gonna be okay!
Thank you so much!
