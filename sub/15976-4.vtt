WEBVTT

00:05.207 --> 00:06.891
Wait, you're going on vacation?

00:06.893 --> 00:08.326
Why is that so shocking?

00:08.328 --> 00:10.695
Well, because you've never
done it for as long

00:10.697 --> 00:12.147
as I've known you, and...

00:12.149 --> 00:14.228
last Labor Day,
you spent the entire time

00:14.263 --> 00:15.900
in the office
replenishing the staplers.

00:15.902 --> 00:17.769
It's Labor Day.
Why does nobody ever get that?

00:17.771 --> 00:20.038
Okay, truth?

00:20.040 --> 00:21.740
My dad's forcing me
to take a week off.

00:21.742 --> 00:24.909
He said if I show up at the office,
he's authorized security to tase.

00:24.911 --> 00:26.060
There you go.

00:26.062 --> 00:27.228
But I can't hang out tonight.

00:27.230 --> 00:28.463
I'm hanging with a buddy.

00:28.465 --> 00:30.215
You don't have "buddies."

00:30.217 --> 00:31.366
Nobody has "buddies."

00:31.368 --> 00:34.119
I have buddies. I went to college.
I was on the tetherball squad.

00:34.121 --> 00:35.236
So where is it?

00:35.238 --> 00:36.538
Where is it that you're going,
anyway?

00:36.540 --> 00:38.239
Hawaii.

00:38.241 --> 00:39.891
It's this women's group thing.

00:39.893 --> 00:41.359
Women's group?

00:41.361 --> 00:43.294
For, you know,
busy professionals on the go.

00:43.296 --> 00:45.313
Sweetie, are you excited about
your lesbian adventure?

00:45.315 --> 00:47.265
- It is a women's adventure group, okay?
- Okay.

00:47.267 --> 00:48.416
It's called Victory Tours,

00:48.418 --> 00:49.901
and it's been around
for a really long time.

00:49.903 --> 00:51.736
Victory Tours.
And their motto again is...?

00:51.738 --> 00:54.105
"We put the 'V' in adventure."

00:54.107 --> 00:55.640
They said all orientations welcome.

00:55.642 --> 00:56.924
You'll be very welcome.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.759
You have a good time.
Next stop, Hawaii.

00:58.761 --> 01:00.195
Bring me back some macadamia nuts.

01:00.197 --> 01:01.196
And a plastic lei?

01:01.198 --> 01:02.781
I thought your mother was in Europe.

01:02.783 --> 01:04.983
Fine. But I'm coming straight to work
on Saturday from the airport.

01:04.985 --> 01:07.252
With a brand-new Subaru.

01:07.254 --> 01:09.204
Why are you wearing a cardigan?

01:09.206 --> 01:11.823
There was a briskness in the air.

01:11.825 --> 01:13.875
Oh, my God, there is no "buddy."

01:13.877 --> 01:14.993
You're dating her again.

01:14.995 --> 01:16.277
You're back with Nancy Cardigan!

01:16.279 --> 01:17.962
Her name is Nancy Norris.

01:17.964 --> 01:19.247
Andrew, I thought
we were done with her.

01:19.249 --> 01:20.982
I mean, she's so bossy
and controlling and shrill!

01:20.984 --> 01:22.801
Well, so are you, and I like you.

01:22.803 --> 01:24.002
And I like cardigans, too.

01:24.004 --> 01:25.103
Woo-woo.

01:25.105 --> 01:27.405
The devil takes such cozy forms.

01:31.260 --> 01:32.744
God, she sounds like the worst.

01:32.746 --> 01:35.230
Yeah, I can't wait to
see you either... buddy.

01:35.232 --> 01:37.131
I'll pick one up on the way back.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.266
No gluten, no cheese.

01:38.268 --> 01:40.552
Who wants those things
junking up our pizza?

01:40.554 --> 01:41.569
The worst.

01:41.571 --> 01:44.176
So what are you doing tonight?

01:44.211 --> 01:47.519
Uh, I, uh, have a date
with, uh, this girl.

01:47.554 --> 01:49.727
- Girl have a name?
- They usually do.

01:49.729 --> 01:51.179
Sydney, bon voyage.

01:51.181 --> 01:52.831
Godspeed, cheerio,
now get out of here.

01:52.833 --> 01:54.449
You know what?
I still have some filing.

01:54.451 --> 01:55.783
Actually, I think I'm just
gonna hang back...

01:55.785 --> 01:57.285
Nope, end of the business day.

01:57.287 --> 01:58.303
Your vacation starts immediately.

01:58.305 --> 02:00.371
You should be doing poi shooters
by the pool by now.

02:00.373 --> 02:01.589
- Simon?
- Hmm?

02:01.591 --> 02:03.074
We just got a call
from the burrito people.

02:03.076 --> 02:05.009
They need to move the pitch up
to tomorrow morning.

02:05.011 --> 02:06.327
Tomorrow?
That wasn't supposed to be

02:06.329 --> 02:08.213
- till next week.
- We're not ready.

02:08.215 --> 02:09.163
We don't even have the idea yet.

02:09.164 --> 02:10.465
Look, this is a really big account.

02:10.467 --> 02:12.016
- I'm canceling my trip.
- No, you're not.

02:12.018 --> 02:14.233
I'm the 11th hour guy.
I live for this.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.303
We're cutting to the good part
of the movie.

02:15.305 --> 02:16.688
No fall from glory,

02:16.690 --> 02:18.690
no montage of me
punching a locker full of meat.

02:18.692 --> 02:20.391
It's me leading a group
of inner-city kids

02:20.393 --> 02:22.594
to spelling bee glory,
in a clown nose.

02:22.596 --> 02:24.295
What is this movie?

02:24.297 --> 02:25.613
Come on, kids, we can do
this in a couple of hours.

02:25.615 --> 02:26.781
You'll still have your nights.

02:26.783 --> 02:27.999
And, Lauren, you can still make
your poetry slam.

02:28.001 --> 02:29.234
Why does she get to stay?

02:29.236 --> 02:30.201
Poetry slam?

02:30.203 --> 02:32.654
I started writing to get over
the break-up with my ex, Charlie.

02:32.656 --> 02:34.038
A lot of people don't know this,

02:34.040 --> 02:36.241
but you can channel
hurt and pain into art.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.024
So true.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.025
Dad, please...

02:38.027 --> 02:39.327
Sydney, no, go, go.
Enjoy your trip.

02:39.329 --> 02:41.362
Come on now, when have
I ever let you down?

02:42.064 --> 02:43.531
Oh, look, there's your mom.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.901
Fine, everybody gets to stay and work,
and I have to go to Hawaii.

02:46.903 --> 02:48.219
Are you even hearing yourself?

02:48.221 --> 02:49.754
This is so unfair.

02:52.180 --> 02:54.780
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

02:54.915 --> 02:57.476
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

02:57.611 --> 03:00.274

03:15.923 --> 03:17.540
Do you know what this is?

03:17.542 --> 03:20.527
The most expensive coffee bean
in the world.

03:20.529 --> 03:22.896
- Do you know where it comes from?
- The break room?

03:22.898 --> 03:23.830
Poop.

03:23.832 --> 03:26.332
The civet cat of Indonesia
eats these coffee beans.

03:26.334 --> 03:28.651
It then passes into its intestinal tract,

03:28.653 --> 03:30.570
where fermentation takes place.

03:30.572 --> 03:32.155
Its essential flavors are condensed...

03:32.157 --> 03:33.323
kind of a fecal fusion...

03:33.325 --> 03:36.125
and then the cat poops out
the beans and voilà!

03:36.127 --> 03:37.226
Pure gold.

03:37.228 --> 03:38.411
Right. Right, right, right.

03:38.413 --> 03:39.746
So how does this relate
to the burrito campaign?

03:39.748 --> 03:41.364
I don't have a clue.
I was just hoping

03:41.366 --> 03:42.866
you'd make the connection,
you know, and...

03:42.868 --> 03:44.417
Are you giving the
"you never know what gem

03:44.419 --> 03:45.752
is gonna come from cat poop"
speech again?

03:45.754 --> 03:47.587
I knew I had a point to this.
What are you doing here?

03:47.589 --> 03:48.655
I changed my flight.

03:48.657 --> 03:50.974
I booked a puddle jumper
that arrives right on time

03:50.976 --> 03:52.592
for the "Exploration of the Flower"
seminar.

03:52.594 --> 03:54.444
Are you sure they mean flower flowers?

03:54.446 --> 03:56.913
What else would it...

03:56.915 --> 03:58.114
Oh.

03:58.116 --> 03:59.749
I guess I can miss that one.

03:59.751 --> 04:01.301
I'm okay with you missing that, too.

04:01.303 --> 04:02.518
Besides, it's your vacation.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.554
You should be passed out
in a kiddie pool somewhere.

04:04.556 --> 04:05.471
Nope. It's all good.

04:05.473 --> 04:06.723
You guys have me.

04:06.725 --> 04:08.224
I'm here. I'll just, uh, sit down,

04:08.226 --> 04:09.726
and I'll jump in
when I have something.

04:09.728 --> 04:11.461
- Okay.
- Burrito.

04:11.463 --> 04:13.479
- Burri-to.
- Gotcha.

04:13.481 --> 04:14.847
Burrito.

04:14.849 --> 04:15.932
So, Lauren,
you getting all these gems?

04:15.934 --> 04:17.000
Yep.

04:17.002 --> 04:18.117
Cat poop coffee,

04:18.119 --> 04:20.153
Sydney realized her flower
is her vagina,

04:20.154 --> 04:23.456
Simon doesn't like talking
about Sydney's flower-slash-vagina,

04:23.458 --> 04:25.107
and burrito, burrito, burrito.

04:25.109 --> 04:26.459
We've got some good stuff there.

04:26.461 --> 04:28.728
Okay, people, time to roll up
our sleeves and really dig in.

04:28.730 --> 04:30.797
- Lauren?
- Yeah?

04:30.799 --> 04:32.065
Time for one of your poems.

04:32.067 --> 04:33.800
Wait... right now?
We' just getting to work.

04:33.802 --> 04:35.001
This is the work.

04:35.003 --> 04:36.469
Sometimes, honey,
the best ideas come from life.

04:36.471 --> 04:38.120
And nothing celebrates life
more than poetry.

04:38.122 --> 04:39.222
Except haikus.
They're just lazy

04:39.224 --> 04:41.808
and sometimes very stimulating,
but please, go on.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.677
"Light" by Anonymous.

04:44.679 --> 04:46.079
I'm Anonymous.

04:46.081 --> 04:49.732
"I tie the rope with a careful touch.

04:49.734 --> 04:51.551
"A simple noose that kills and such.

04:51.553 --> 04:54.687
"The kicks and moans
till half past noon.

04:54.689 --> 04:56.739
"It's okay, I say, it's all over soon.

04:56.741 --> 04:59.659
"A timeless love, an affair so bright.

04:59.661 --> 05:02.362
Goodnight, sweet Charlie,
head toward the light."

05:05.382 --> 05:06.988
That inspire anyone?

05:07.023 --> 05:09.285
It inspired me to renew
my concealed weapons permit.

05:09.287 --> 05:10.703
But we can work with this.

05:10.705 --> 05:12.005
How about this?
"Murder your breakfast."

05:12.007 --> 05:13.473
- Breakfast of death.
- Your last meal.

05:13.475 --> 05:14.674
- Choking the cheese.
- Yes.

05:14.676 --> 05:16.158
- Guac-a-murder.
- Torture-tilla.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.711
I guess it is beneficial
to know which road not to go down.

05:18.713 --> 05:19.929
I'm gonna change my flight
to Monday.

05:19.931 --> 05:21.381
Honey, sweetie, please.
We've only been at this

05:21.383 --> 05:22.982
for 45 minutes.
We're almost there.

05:22.984 --> 05:24.801
We're gonna find this idea
in no time.

05:24.803 --> 05:26.803
How about this one?
Uh, carne con carnage, huh?

05:26.805 --> 05:28.838
Sal-sassinate your appetite.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.940
Sal-sassination.

05:35.112 --> 05:36.529
Finally. It's been driving me nuts.

05:36.531 --> 05:38.347
It's been two weeks
since the power outage.

05:38.349 --> 05:39.732
Six more clocks to go!

05:39.734 --> 05:41.617
Dad, no more clocks.
We've need to land on an idea.

05:41.619 --> 05:42.902
Honey, you're gonna miss your flight.

05:42.904 --> 05:44.854
I always try and get there
an hour and a half early,

05:44.856 --> 05:46.489
especially when I'm keistering hash,
but that's just me.

05:46.491 --> 05:48.341
Time to hunker down, people.

05:48.343 --> 05:49.792
We have to get creative from life.

05:49.794 --> 05:51.694
Now, who has a personal memory
involving a burrito?

05:51.696 --> 05:53.029
- I have one.
- Hmm?

05:53.031 --> 05:54.380
Um, well, actually, this...

05:54.382 --> 05:56.132
this girl Natalie I'm-I'm seeing

05:56.134 --> 05:58.034
has a... has a funny story
about a burrito.

05:58.036 --> 05:59.302
Um, she was six

05:59.304 --> 06:01.371
and staying with her
Aunt Bunny in Margate.

06:01.373 --> 06:03.589
- Oh, Margate.
- Her parents were splitting up.

06:03.591 --> 06:06.259
Super, super tough summer
for her, and, you know...

06:06.261 --> 06:08.878
But Aunt Bunny, um, took her
to a Mexican restaurant

06:08.880 --> 06:10.096
for the first time.

06:10.098 --> 06:12.482
And... oh!
She was so excited

06:12.484 --> 06:15.568
that she, uh,
she asked for a "boweeto."

06:15.570 --> 06:17.403
"Boweeto." It's...

06:17.405 --> 06:20.690
I mean, you got to hear her say it,
'cause it's so adorable.

06:22.059 --> 06:25.278
Anyway, that's just a story I heard
from this girl Natalie.

06:25.280 --> 06:26.646
I think that's her name.
Whatever.

06:26.648 --> 06:28.664
Oh...

06:28.666 --> 06:30.533
That's something.

06:30.535 --> 06:33.669
Oh, my God, you were gushing.

06:33.671 --> 06:34.737
You like her.

06:34.739 --> 06:35.788
I do not like her.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.256
You better be in love with her

06:37.258 --> 06:39.075
after that pointless story
you made us listen to.

06:39.077 --> 06:40.910
Zach, don't lie to us.

06:41.745 --> 06:43.245
Fine.

06:43.247 --> 06:44.514
Yeah, yeah, I like her.

06:44.516 --> 06:45.681
But you think I'm proud of myself?

06:45.683 --> 06:47.750
This is sick!
I hate what I've become!

06:47.752 --> 06:49.802
- Aw...
- This is beautiful.

06:49.804 --> 06:51.020
This is your first crush.

06:51.022 --> 06:52.271
Sydney's was a homely neighbor boy,

06:52.273 --> 06:54.524
but this one... this is something
I can be proud of.

06:54.526 --> 06:56.192
Zach, tell us more. Inspire us.

06:56.194 --> 06:58.394
Can we just talk about something...
What about the Congo?

06:58.396 --> 07:00.063
We've all got our problems.
How about the conflict here?

07:00.065 --> 07:01.647
- Sydney...
- We need a campaign!

07:01.649 --> 07:02.982
Do you not trust me?

07:02.984 --> 07:04.784
Look, I-I know

07:04.786 --> 07:07.703
that your process involves art
and music and, I don't know,

07:07.705 --> 07:09.655
living with monks in Tibet
for a month...

07:09.657 --> 07:11.491
Even with a vow of silence,
those guys can be catty bitches.

07:11.493 --> 07:13.910
- But we don't have that kind of time.
- Mm...

07:14.962 --> 07:16.329
Dad?

07:16.331 --> 07:18.280
Sorry, my mind wandered.

07:18.282 --> 07:20.883
I was thinking about
my nemesis at the monastery.

07:20.885 --> 07:23.336
Brother Wu.
He said my chanting was pitchy.

07:23.338 --> 07:24.954
It may have been.

07:24.956 --> 07:27.456
- I trust you. I promise.
- Okay. Really?

07:27.458 --> 07:28.674
And I'm gonna go on my trip, okay?

07:28.676 --> 07:30.093
Just let me help out a little more,
okay?

07:30.095 --> 07:31.511
Give me 20 minutes.

07:31.513 --> 07:33.913
I think I have a super fun way
to move things forward.

07:34.681 --> 07:37.800
Not the creativity binder!

07:37.802 --> 07:39.135
<i>El binder de los muertos!</i>

07:40.238 --> 07:43.256
We should come up with a more
universal standard for the word "fun."

07:43.258 --> 07:45.741
Make all the jokes that you want,
but my system,

07:45.743 --> 07:46.959
or "Sydstem"...

07:46.961 --> 07:49.328
You see what I did there?

07:49.330 --> 07:50.680
...works.

07:50.682 --> 07:53.116
Look, these are tried-and-true methods
to help me with my ideas, okay?

07:53.118 --> 07:54.867
The first thing that we do
is we draw

07:54.869 --> 07:56.536
a discovery circle.

07:59.874 --> 08:02.074
- Whoa...
- Amazing.

08:02.076 --> 08:03.025
What?

08:03.027 --> 08:04.844
Your circle... it's flawless.

08:04.846 --> 08:06.212
Do it again.

08:08.382 --> 08:09.665
- Come on!
- Whoa!

08:09.667 --> 08:11.017
Now do it with your eyes closed.

08:11.019 --> 08:13.052
- Draw a hexagon, just for fun.
- She's not human.

08:13.054 --> 08:14.637
It's like a portal
into a bland dimension.

08:14.639 --> 08:16.105
As much as I'm enjoying this...

08:16.107 --> 08:17.473
and trust me,
I'm flying right now...

08:17.475 --> 08:19.442
we need to fill those bad boys
with ideas.

08:19.444 --> 08:21.060
See you soon. You, too.

08:22.646 --> 08:24.564
Sorry. That was a, uh, buddy.

08:24.566 --> 08:25.948
Oh.

08:25.950 --> 08:27.133
So why'd you say "you, too"?

08:27.135 --> 08:29.185
Because we have a fun relationship.

08:29.187 --> 08:31.187
For example, one fun thing we do

08:31.189 --> 08:33.573
is end each phone conversation
with a trivia question.

08:33.575 --> 08:35.041
Tonight's was...
"What's your favorite band?"

08:35.043 --> 08:36.759
My answer, naturally, was "U2."

08:36.760 --> 08:39.028
You're wearing a cardigan.
Why?

08:39.030 --> 08:40.712
No reason. No reason at all.

08:40.715 --> 08:41.831
Of course there's a reason!

08:41.832 --> 08:43.499
Only insane people and gypsies
wear cardigans.

08:43.501 --> 08:44.667
He's back with Nancy Cardigan.

08:44.669 --> 08:45.968
I knew it!

08:45.970 --> 08:47.369
Shouldn't you be shaming yourself
at a hula class?

08:47.371 --> 08:49.205
Excuse me.
Who's Nancy Cardigan?

08:49.207 --> 08:50.506
Andrew's on-again, off-again,

08:50.508 --> 08:52.391
horribly annoying ex-girlfriend
that he swore he would

08:52.393 --> 08:54.227
- never get back together with.
- She's not that bad.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.012
She takes the light out of your soul.

08:56.014 --> 08:57.096
And makes you use big words.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.564
That's patently fallacious!

08:58.566 --> 09:00.066
She also "doesn't own a TV"...

09:00.068 --> 09:02.401
as if that's even a thing...
and then she makes him act like

09:02.403 --> 09:04.904
- he doesn't watch Atlanta Housewives.
- Ugh! She sounds like a monster.

09:04.906 --> 09:07.223
Well, I don't watch that show.
It's beneath me.

09:07.225 --> 09:09.225
Oh, suddenly you're too good
for Nene and Phaedra

09:09.227 --> 09:10.993
and... what's her name,
the one that twirls?

09:10.995 --> 09:12.612
- Kenya.
- Oh! I guess you do watch it, huh?

09:12.614 --> 09:14.230
Damn it! Okay, fine.

09:14.232 --> 09:16.666
But you know what?
Nancy elevates me as a person.

09:16.668 --> 09:18.400
And besides,
you guys don't even know her.

09:18.402 --> 09:20.369
How can you hate someone
you don't even know?

09:20.371 --> 09:21.537
Don't know Hitler, don't like him.

09:21.539 --> 09:23.206
All right, can we get back to work?

09:23.208 --> 09:25.174
Yes. As soon as you agree
to break up with her

09:25.176 --> 09:26.592
before she makes you layer
your polos again.

09:26.594 --> 09:27.527
It was not a good look.

09:27.529 --> 09:29.679
- Tell me, son...
- Yeah?

09:29.681 --> 09:31.180
What do you really feel
about Nancy putting you

09:31.182 --> 09:33.382
in this cardigan?
Do you like it?

09:33.384 --> 09:35.718
Well, I don't... It's soft.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.087
I mean, keeps my arms warm,
lets my middle breathe...

09:38.089 --> 09:40.756
- But do you like it?
- It's got these tan buttons...

09:41.475 --> 09:42.942
Do you like it?

09:42.944 --> 09:44.277
No! Okay? I hate it!

09:44.279 --> 09:45.594
I hate everything about it!

09:45.596 --> 09:46.812
I knew there was a reason

09:46.814 --> 09:47.930
why the inspiration
wasn't coming to us!

09:47.932 --> 09:50.249
Your spirit is blocked,
and you've blocked us all!

09:50.251 --> 09:52.368
Burn it!

09:52.370 --> 09:53.703
Wait, Dad, I don't think
that's really a good idea.

09:53.705 --> 09:55.288
Oh, no, we have to burn it, honey.
Listen to me.

09:55.290 --> 09:56.289
The creative gods are angry.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.907
They need blood.
They want sweater blood.

09:57.909 --> 10:00.159
In the name of Mr. Rogers,
I command you!

10:00.161 --> 10:02.078
- I don't know if this is a good idea.
- Oh, come on now, Andrew.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.412
You've become a slave to wool,

10:03.414 --> 10:04.997
and you're trying to pull
the wool over our eyes.

10:04.999 --> 10:08.718
And these fibers are as unnatural
as this ruse of a relationship.

10:08.720 --> 10:10.636
Burn the demon fiber
and set yourself free!

10:10.638 --> 10:12.588
Set us all free!

10:14.175 --> 10:16.475
Yes! Be gone, demon lint!

10:16.477 --> 10:17.977
Don't!

10:17.979 --> 10:19.428
Be gone!

10:23.568 --> 10:25.034
Oh, yes!

10:27.654 --> 10:29.338
We need more water!

10:34.662 --> 10:36.662
My binder!

10:36.664 --> 10:37.980
Leave the binder!

10:37.982 --> 10:39.865
- Andrew, my binder!
- Save yourself!

10:39.867 --> 10:42.201
- God!
- No!

10:42.203 --> 10:43.202
They shut the door!

10:43.204 --> 10:45.171
- My binder!
- Save us!

10:45.173 --> 10:46.455
My binder!

10:52.675 --> 10:55.761
I can't help but feel a tiny wisp
of responsibility for this.

10:55.763 --> 10:56.879
- A tiny wisp?
- Mm.

10:56.881 --> 10:58.414
You were literally playing
with matches.

10:58.416 --> 11:00.116
- Honey, it's all part of my...
- Process?

11:00.118 --> 11:02.118
What's next,
teasing dogs we don't know?

11:02.120 --> 11:04.356
Well, to crack an idea, occasionally I have
to break a few metaphorical eggs.

11:04.394 --> 11:06.398
You know, sometimes in life,
you have to start some fires.

11:07.559 --> 11:09.008
- Sir?
- Mm?

11:09.010 --> 11:12.295
I'm now legally required to ask you if
you're sexually aroused by starting fires.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.280
It depends. Every fire's different.

11:17.517 --> 11:18.868
- I'm canceling my vacation.
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.870 --> 11:20.987
I mean, clearly,
I cannot leave you unsupervised.

11:20.989 --> 11:23.522
Well, this all happened
under your supervision.

11:23.524 --> 11:25.575
I wonder if they have a Dalmatian.

11:25.577 --> 11:27.043
I'm not going!

11:27.045 --> 11:29.328
Okay, Andrew,
you and I are gonna get

11:29.330 --> 11:31.581
out of these wet clothes,
and then when we get back,

11:31.583 --> 11:33.549
we are gonna nail this pitch.

11:33.551 --> 11:36.302
Safe to say nobody will be
making their plans tonight.

11:37.254 --> 11:38.387
Maybe it's for the best.

11:38.389 --> 11:41.040
I mean, if I like Natalie,
I could love her.

11:41.042 --> 11:43.208
And we all know what that leads to.

11:43.210 --> 11:45.377
Suburban murder/suicide.

11:46.263 --> 11:48.669
Or what-what were you thinking?

11:48.704 --> 11:50.016
That Charlie got out
in the nick of time.

11:51.052 --> 11:52.134
And how are you totally dry?

11:52.136 --> 11:55.588
I learned to take cover under tables
during my summer in Juarez.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.490
What about you?

11:57.492 --> 11:59.909
Oh, don't even start with me.
I'm soaked.

11:59.911 --> 12:02.044
I must look terrible.

12:05.231 --> 12:06.582
Oh.

12:08.234 --> 12:09.935
"Grab a Can"?

12:09.937 --> 12:11.070
From the Pringles campaign.

12:11.072 --> 12:12.722
Yeah, I know where it's from,

12:12.724 --> 12:14.840
I just don't like
drawing attention to my...

12:14.842 --> 12:17.043
You'll be fine. You know,
you almost have an ass.

12:17.045 --> 12:19.178
Or a place where your back
and your legs meet.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.964
Are you bringing a blazer
to the beach?

12:21.966 --> 12:24.634
What possible use
could you have for that there?

12:24.636 --> 12:28.638
Maybe, you know, over
a bathing suit or to a luau.

12:28.640 --> 12:31.256
Or while tandem parasailing
with Nancy Pelosi?

12:33.611 --> 12:39.264
Okay, so maybe I might have
this recurring fantasy or something.

12:39.266 --> 12:41.617
Oh. Well, you could share.

12:41.619 --> 12:44.070
Okay! Um, so I'm in Hawaii.

12:44.072 --> 12:45.604
- I'm listening.
- And there's a tsunami.

12:45.606 --> 12:46.772
- Of course.
- And I'm on the beach,

12:46.774 --> 12:48.440
and everyone is washed away.

12:48.442 --> 12:51.777
But then I look up,
and there's one half-naked man.

12:53.113 --> 12:54.463
And that's when I realize

12:54.465 --> 12:57.115
it's the Dole executive
I've been trying to meet.

12:57.150 --> 12:59.835
So I put on my blazer and I
give him the pitch of my life.

12:59.837 --> 13:02.838
That's the single stupidest
sexual fantasy I've ever heard.

13:02.840 --> 13:03.906
It's a recurring fantasy.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.124
- It's about work.
- So what?

13:05.126 --> 13:06.959
- It's incredibly sad.
- So are you.

13:06.961 --> 13:08.477
What's sad about me?

13:08.479 --> 13:10.629
You're whipped by a girl
who hates gluten

13:10.631 --> 13:12.848
- but likes everything else that sucks.
- What?

13:12.850 --> 13:15.317
Andrew, she's pretentious.
She says "Budapesht."

13:15.319 --> 13:16.519
That's the correct pronunciation.

13:16.521 --> 13:18.971
She puts artisanal jam
on something called a cronut.

13:18.973 --> 13:22.074
It's a donut-slash-croissant,
and it's delicious!

13:23.727 --> 13:26.162
The only reason
you're criticizing... her

13:26.164 --> 13:27.913
is because you don't
even know her.

13:27.915 --> 13:30.199
It's because I know you.

13:30.201 --> 13:31.367
And-and look at you.

13:31.369 --> 13:33.786
You're smart and handsome
and funny and tall,

13:33.788 --> 13:36.122
and you're none of those things
when you're dating her.

13:36.124 --> 13:39.514
- She makes me less tall?
- You know what I mean.

13:39.793 --> 13:42.128
I just don't want you to settle.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.829
What would you
have me do instead?

13:45.665 --> 13:47.383
Go with your heart, you know?

13:47.385 --> 13:49.334
Find someone that loves you
for you,

13:49.336 --> 13:51.957
who doesn't want to change you.

13:56.876 --> 13:58.166
Wait, what are you doing?!

13:58.201 --> 13:59.862
- I was just reading the signs.
- What signs?

13:59.864 --> 14:01.397
There were no signs.
I signaled nothing!

14:01.399 --> 14:02.898
You signaled.
You were signaling a lot.

14:02.900 --> 14:04.984
You said that I should
break up with my girlfriend,

14:04.986 --> 14:06.335
you told me a sexual fantasy...

14:06.337 --> 14:07.870
No, a business fantasy!

14:07.872 --> 14:10.906
You said that I was wonderful
and that I should follow my heart.

14:10.908 --> 14:13.676
And then you did a little
striptease number. My God!

14:13.678 --> 14:15.360
None of that was intentional.

14:15.362 --> 14:16.528
So you weren't...?

14:16.530 --> 14:19.081
No! You and I are, you know, buddies.

14:19.083 --> 14:22.384
Buddies who don't kiss,
who see no need to improve on a donut.

14:22.386 --> 14:25.337
I've destroyed everything.

14:25.339 --> 14:28.007
No! No, you haven't.
It's fine.

14:28.009 --> 14:29.308
You know, we'll just forget
it ever happened.

14:29.310 --> 14:31.677
No, no, I'm just gonna have
to call HR on myself.

14:31.679 --> 14:32.895
It's gonna be an awkward call.

14:32.897 --> 14:34.897
I'm the HR watchdog
for this entire floor.

14:34.899 --> 14:37.216
No, we'll-we'll just forget it.

14:37.218 --> 14:38.517
I mean, distant memory.

14:38.519 --> 14:40.736
Everything is so weird now.

14:42.000 --> 14:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:52.544 --> 14:54.275
I'm sorry,
but I can't stop talking about it.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.365
I can.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.951
Well, I'm one of seven sisters.
We communicate, marinate,

14:56.953 --> 14:58.453
we discuss our feelings
while we quilt.

14:58.455 --> 15:00.821
Okay, well, I'm from a family of addicts,
and we shove things down.

15:00.826 --> 15:02.835
You know, pills, food,
feelings, anything we can,

15:02.926 --> 15:04.876
so when the EMTs arrive,
they're not disappointed.

15:04.878 --> 15:06.077
- Hey.
- What's going on?

15:06.079 --> 15:07.829
Why are you dressed for
a rousing game of Parcheesi?

15:07.831 --> 15:08.830
Where is my father?

15:08.832 --> 15:10.781
Well, he left this note.

15:10.783 --> 15:13.617
"It's clear the idea isn't here.

15:13.619 --> 15:16.137
"Went out to find it and grab a bite.

15:16.139 --> 15:18.890
Andrew, you're wrong about Housewives.
It's an allegory for our times."

15:18.892 --> 15:20.008
Where do you think he went?

15:20.010 --> 15:21.476
Oh, I have an uncle
who finds people.

15:21.478 --> 15:22.610
Just say the word.

15:22.612 --> 15:24.812
I know where he is.

15:31.020 --> 15:33.104
That makes absolutely no sense.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.356
It makes perfect sense.
This is what he did for a living

15:35.358 --> 15:36.908
before he got his start
in the ad world.

15:36.910 --> 15:40.061
Whenever he gets really blocked,
he comes here to work.

15:40.063 --> 15:41.913
He says putting himself
in the middle of life

15:41.915 --> 15:43.114
gets his creativity flowing.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.750
Um, can we go inside?
My butt says, "Grab a Can,"

15:45.752 --> 15:48.002
and that right there
is a leather bar.

15:48.187 --> 15:51.489
Okay, I got a cat in the hat!
86 the coleslaw!

15:51.491 --> 15:53.374
I got two tuna melts
and a herd of burgers!

15:53.376 --> 15:54.759
Steak up, still mooing!

15:54.761 --> 15:57.795
Betty, come on! I got shrimp
dying in the window here, huh?

15:57.797 --> 15:59.497
- Dad.
- Hi, baby.

15:59.499 --> 16:01.382
This help you
come up with a campaign?

16:01.384 --> 16:03.851
Not yet, but I'm circling it.

16:03.853 --> 16:06.670
"Not your typical breakfast."

16:06.672 --> 16:09.307
"We do know beans from potatoes."

16:09.309 --> 16:11.025
"DVR DanceMoms"?

16:11.027 --> 16:14.479
Well, you know
I like 'em mean and hefty.

16:14.481 --> 16:17.198
I'm sorry. I didn't find an idea.

16:17.200 --> 16:19.067
Maybe you were right
not to trust me.

16:19.069 --> 16:21.869
The next time I ask you,
"When have I ever let you down?"

16:21.871 --> 16:23.988
remember this date,
which you should know anyway,

16:23.990 --> 16:26.491
because it's the same date
in 1979 that I peed

16:26.493 --> 16:29.744
on Andy Warhol's shoe in
the ladies' room at Studio 54.

16:29.746 --> 16:31.496
I did not know that.

16:31.498 --> 16:32.413
Okay, people,

16:32.415 --> 16:33.864
I'm pulling the plug.

16:33.866 --> 16:37.034
I'd rather no pitch at all than
present some half-assed idea.

16:37.036 --> 16:40.037
This is a first. How can we
not come up with anything?

16:40.039 --> 16:41.756
So weird.
Maybe there's something in the air.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.040
I'll tell you what's weird.

16:43.042 --> 16:44.308
When Sydney and I were changing in...

16:44.310 --> 16:45.893
Oh, my God, we're going there? Fine.

16:45.895 --> 16:47.762
We kissed, okay?
But he kissed me

16:47.764 --> 16:50.047
for, like, a millisecond,
and it was not a big deal.

16:50.049 --> 16:52.567
That's funny, because neither of you seem
good enough for the other.

16:52.569 --> 16:54.602
That closes the lesbian chapter.

16:54.604 --> 16:57.572
As I was saying,
when Sydney and I were changing,

16:57.574 --> 16:59.857
we discovered she'd invented
the beach blazer.

16:59.859 --> 17:01.409
But thank you for spilling that

17:01.411 --> 17:04.060
horribly private moment we were
never gonna speak of again.

17:04.063 --> 17:07.248
I should be under a palm tree
with ladies wearing chain wallets.

17:07.250 --> 17:08.415
I feel terrible.

17:08.417 --> 17:10.667
I ruined your vacation
you never wanted to go on.

17:10.670 --> 17:12.619
And you guys had plans for the night.

17:12.622 --> 17:15.289
Maybe there's a way to make
this night not a total loss,

17:15.290 --> 17:16.790
still have a little fun.

17:17.709 --> 17:21.194
"The ocean so blue and oh, so deep.

17:21.196 --> 17:23.414
Just three more steps
till eternal sleep..."

17:23.415 --> 17:26.050
And it wasn't so much
that we were stranded in Munich,

17:26.051 --> 17:28.752
but it's like they expect you
to speak German.

17:28.754 --> 17:30.921
So we're at this kiosk,
and we're ordering a pretzel, right?

17:30.923 --> 17:33.107
I thought was, like,
a thing there, you know?

17:33.109 --> 17:35.092
I guess it's not.
We had trouble communicating.

17:35.094 --> 17:37.145
So, looks like
she's really into you, huh?

17:37.147 --> 17:39.263
Yeah, yeah,
I never want to see her again.

17:39.265 --> 17:40.815
So maybe she's not "the one."

17:40.817 --> 17:42.617
But at least you had your first like.

17:42.619 --> 17:44.569
How do I make her stop talking?

17:44.571 --> 17:45.620
Marry her.

17:46.356 --> 17:50.441
"Though Charlie ripped out my heart,
laying bare a fragile soul.

17:50.443 --> 17:55.163
"Her touch still makes me shiver,
her warmth still makes me whole."

17:55.165 --> 17:57.465
Huh, Charlie's a her.

17:57.467 --> 18:00.784
Maybe Lauren should have
taken your vacation.

18:00.786 --> 18:02.786
I don't think we should label her.

18:02.788 --> 18:05.072
She's probably more advanced than us.

18:06.959 --> 18:08.226
Oh, it's Nancy.

18:08.228 --> 18:11.128
Hey, what are you doing up so late?

18:11.130 --> 18:12.814
Well, of course your tummy hurts.

18:12.816 --> 18:15.466
You know you can't have
cinnamon at this hour.

18:20.189 --> 18:22.156
I'm not jealous.

18:22.158 --> 18:23.157
Uh-huh.

18:23.159 --> 18:25.276
You could have fooled me.

18:25.278 --> 18:26.994
That's the same look
you gave April Westerfield

18:26.996 --> 18:29.280
in third grade when she held
hands with Brice McFadden.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.799
I don't know anyone by those names.

18:31.801 --> 18:34.585
Whoa.
That was Rhonda's daughter.

18:35.504 --> 18:37.988
Ever meet Rhonda?
Short hair, Gulf War vet.

18:37.990 --> 18:40.458
We were only married for six days,
you know?

18:40.460 --> 18:42.009
Doesn't matter, she wasn't "the one."

18:42.011 --> 18:45.713
All I'm saying is, you know,
Andrew, Zach, Lauren...

18:45.715 --> 18:47.831
They all have lives outside of work.

18:47.833 --> 18:49.584
Don't be afraid to have one, too.

18:49.586 --> 18:52.854
Just hard for me to let go sometimes.

18:52.856 --> 18:55.640
But you got to learn, or else
you end up like me at your age,

18:55.642 --> 18:58.226
spending all my time at the office,
not experiencing life.

18:58.228 --> 18:59.843
I want more for you.

18:59.845 --> 19:01.979
Thanks, Dad.

19:01.981 --> 19:03.698
Right.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.918
I don't even know what
happened with Andrew. It just...

19:10.188 --> 19:11.589
Am I a cheat?

19:11.591 --> 19:13.241
Say that again.

19:13.243 --> 19:14.358
Am I a cheat?

19:14.360 --> 19:15.860
Whoa.

19:15.862 --> 19:18.079
Wait, why do you have that look?

19:18.081 --> 19:20.214
'Cause I think my half-assed
idea just went whole.

19:20.216 --> 19:22.516
Bless you.

19:26.855 --> 19:28.706
You've been good all week.

19:28.708 --> 19:29.974
You deserve a splurge.

19:29.976 --> 19:32.894
So forget the fiber and
do what you really want to do.

19:32.896 --> 19:35.313
Cheat on your breakfast.

19:35.315 --> 19:37.848
Ah, yes! You killed it, boss.

19:37.850 --> 19:40.101
Adultery and breakfast together at last.

19:40.103 --> 19:42.103
Client's gonna be here in, like,
a half an hour.

19:42.105 --> 19:43.604
Maybe we should squeegee
the conference room.

19:43.606 --> 19:45.406
Yeah, I'm gonna go see
if my clothes are dried.

19:45.408 --> 19:47.057
This looks a little intimidating.

19:47.943 --> 19:50.411
You know, I have to admit,
last night was

19:50.413 --> 19:51.696
- kind of fun.
- Right?

19:51.698 --> 19:53.698
- And technically, I was your muse.
- You were.

19:53.700 --> 19:55.583
- The messier my life...
- The better the idea.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.901
- Let's never do it that way again.
- Agreed.

19:58.855 --> 20:00.988
Uh, still a little dank.

20:00.990 --> 20:03.073
You gonna call me
as soon as you get back?

20:03.075 --> 20:06.510
Will do... buddy.

20:06.512 --> 20:09.246
And don't be offended,
but I, uh, feel compelled

20:09.248 --> 20:11.265
to, uh, grab your can.

20:11.267 --> 20:13.968
I am not a toy!

20:13.970 --> 20:16.934
Do it again!
Give me a chance to clench!

20:24.664 --> 20:26.731
♪ This fun guy, and caliente guy ♪

20:26.733 --> 20:27.765
♪ Boom-boom! ♪

20:27.767 --> 20:29.066
♪ Come on, con carne, con carnage ♪

20:29.068 --> 20:30.151
♪ Boom! ♪

20:30.153 --> 20:31.652
What about you?

20:33.840 --> 20:36.874
Back up! Back up!
Back up! Back up! Yeah!

20:36.876 --> 20:38.609
Rice and beans! Ah!

20:38.611 --> 20:40.294
Burrito in the hole! Yeah!

20:40.296 --> 20:41.996
Bagel. Bagel.

20:41.998 --> 20:43.297
What, just bagel?

20:43.299 --> 20:44.432
What about you?

20:44.434 --> 20:45.833
Oh, don't even start with me.

20:45.835 --> 20:47.117
I'm soaking wet.
