01:22.281 --> 01:23.448
Next.

01:23.482 --> 01:29.220
Okay, to the
                    N-E-G-A-T-E.

01:29.222 --> 01:31.656
"Negate" for,
                uh, nine points.

01:31.690 --> 01:34.192
Uh, mind if
        I play?

01:34.227 --> 01:35.293
Huh?

01:35.327 --> 01:36.894
No, be my guest.

01:36.929 --> 01:39.531
I can't make anything
    out of those letters anyway.

01:43.769 --> 01:45.336
(sighs)

01:45.370 --> 01:46.404
(scoffs)

01:50.910 --> 01:55.679
B... L...

01:55.714 --> 02:02.553
O... R... F.

02:02.587 --> 02:04.289
Blorf.

02:06.325 --> 02:08.627
How many points?

02:08.661 --> 02:10.794
That isn't a word.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.930
Is it?

02:11.964 --> 02:13.898
No! I'm sorry, Jim,

02:13.932 --> 02:17.268
but that's not
                 a word-- blorf.

02:17.302 --> 02:18.303
Yes?

02:18.337 --> 02:20.472
Did someone call me?

02:20.506 --> 02:21.939
No.

02:21.974 --> 02:25.610
Oh, I thought I heard
       someone say Blorf.

02:25.644 --> 02:28.947
Blorf was my nickname
      in the old country.

02:28.981 --> 02:31.316
Kids can be cruel.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.285
Thanks a lot, Jim.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.919
Thanks very much.
               Sure.

02:34.953 --> 02:37.389
Ooh, what are these tickets
            in your pocket, huh?

02:37.423 --> 02:39.191
Oh, yeah,
                     yeah, yeah.

02:39.225 --> 02:43.528
Instead of a tip,
       some fare gave me

02:43.562 --> 02:46.898
tickets to see Itzhak Perlman.

02:46.932 --> 02:50.401
Jim... Itzhak Perlman is

02:50.435 --> 02:52.571
the greatest violinist
in the world.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.772
Oh-oh-oh.

02:54.806 --> 02:59.277
I-I thought it was
      a religious service.

02:59.311 --> 03:03.314
Uh, um, who wants to go with me?

03:03.348 --> 03:04.181
Oh, I'd love to go.

03:04.216 --> 03:06.517
That sounds great to me.

03:06.551 --> 03:10.588
Well, I guess I'm gonna
     have to choose between

03:10.623 --> 03:13.358
Elaine and Alex.

03:13.392 --> 03:15.426
Oh!

03:15.460 --> 03:19.698
This is gonna be
        a tough choice.

03:19.732 --> 03:21.700
They're both good friends.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.268
(sighs)

03:23.302 --> 03:26.904
Elaine is a beautiful girl.

03:26.938 --> 03:27.905
(giggles)

03:27.939 --> 03:29.340
Huh?

03:29.375 --> 03:30.441
And Alex...

03:32.878 --> 03:36.447
is not a beautiful girl.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.315
No contest.

03:38.350 --> 03:39.851
I choose Elaine.

03:39.885 --> 03:42.821
Oh, boy, that was
     a piece of cake!

03:45.924 --> 03:48.192
(knocking)

03:48.226 --> 03:49.293
Who is it?

03:49.327 --> 03:51.262
Jim Ignatowski.

03:55.534 --> 03:57.167
Hi.

03:57.202 --> 03:59.337
(gasps)

03:59.371 --> 04:01.205
My God.

04:01.239 --> 04:03.508
What, what, what?

04:03.542 --> 04:05.910
No, no, no, no, nothing bad.

04:05.944 --> 04:06.911
It's just that

04:06.945 --> 04:08.479
you're gorgeous.

04:08.514 --> 04:10.114
Oh, that?

04:10.148 --> 04:12.583
Uh, thank you.

04:12.618 --> 04:15.753
I-I... I never tire
  of hearing that.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.724
(chuckles):
            My gosh.

04:19.757 --> 04:24.095
Flowers for a beautiful woman.

04:24.129 --> 04:26.531
Oh, thank you.

04:26.565 --> 04:27.599
(clears throat)

04:27.633 --> 04:31.169
A... corsage

04:31.203 --> 04:33.871
for a beautiful woman.

04:33.906 --> 04:35.372
Oh, Jim.

04:35.407 --> 04:36.507
Oh.

04:36.541 --> 04:38.243
A box of chocolates...

04:40.412 --> 04:43.715
for a b-beautiful woman.

04:43.749 --> 04:45.617
(clears throat)
              Oh.

04:45.651 --> 04:48.753
A-a pen and pencil set...

04:50.722 --> 04:53.158
for a beautiful woman.

04:53.192 --> 04:55.226
Thank you.

04:55.261 --> 04:56.461
(chuckles)

04:56.495 --> 04:59.564
A dozen lamb chops--

04:59.598 --> 05:01.966
or navel oranges.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.934
I forget which.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.206
And...

05:08.240 --> 05:10.908
a Yoda doll

05:10.942 --> 05:13.478
for a beautiful woman.

05:13.512 --> 05:16.715
Jim, you shouldn't have.

05:16.749 --> 05:20.785
Oh, it was nothing.

05:20.819 --> 05:22.487
(clears throat)

05:22.521 --> 05:25.790
So, uh...

05:25.824 --> 05:27.391
you all set to go?

05:30.563 --> 05:32.096
Jim, I-I'm in
                    my bathrobe.

05:32.130 --> 05:33.297
Oh.

05:33.331 --> 05:34.198
Phew.

05:34.232 --> 05:36.367
Boy, I thought
     that was an ugly gown.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.739
What are you
                 doing here now?

05:41.773 --> 05:44.208
Well, I gue--
    I was a little anxious,

05:44.242 --> 05:47.244
so I guess I got here early.

05:47.279 --> 05:51.115
Listen, you take your time
         and get ready,

05:51.149 --> 05:53.017
and I'll wait
      out in the hallway.

05:53.051 --> 05:56.154
The concert is tomorrow.

05:58.623 --> 06:00.058
Oh.

06:02.127 --> 06:04.028
No problem.

06:04.063 --> 06:05.296
I brought a book.

06:07.199 --> 06:10.401
Jim, don't you think it
         would be better for you

06:10.435 --> 06:13.504
if you went home and
         then came back tomorrow

06:13.539 --> 06:15.606
instead of waiting
            out there all night?

06:15.640 --> 06:17.308
Nope.

06:17.342 --> 06:21.612
But, uh, I could,
if you want.

06:21.646 --> 06:24.249
If you want to race the clock.

06:24.283 --> 06:25.282
Let's do that.

06:25.317 --> 06:26.918
Okey-doke.
                   Okay.

06:26.952 --> 06:27.719
(laughs)

06:30.789 --> 06:33.691
I don't want to show up tomorrow
         empty-handed.

06:36.695 --> 06:37.895
The vest matches.

06:37.930 --> 06:39.463
(laughs)

06:39.497 --> 06:41.432
I know, I know.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.148
Oh, my God,
that's Mrs. Weber.

06:57.182 --> 07:00.585
She's one of my art gallery's
biggest clients.

07:00.619 --> 07:03.788
Well, she could lose
           a pound or two.

07:03.822 --> 07:05.757
Shh.

07:08.327 --> 07:09.727
Let's say hello.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.229
No, no, no, no. I-I don't
want her to see me with...

07:12.264 --> 07:14.932
Uh, I-I don't want
to see her right now.

07:14.966 --> 07:17.468
Why-why don't we just
face this way, okay?

07:24.944 --> 07:25.944
Elaine?

07:25.978 --> 07:27.945
Elaine Nardo,
                    is that you?

07:27.979 --> 07:28.813
Mrs. Weber.

07:28.847 --> 07:30.047
Well, how nice
                to see you here.

07:30.081 --> 07:31.315
How are you?
Oh, fine.

07:31.349 --> 07:32.316
And-and you?

07:32.350 --> 07:33.884
Fine, thank you.

07:33.919 --> 07:35.386
I loved
                    Mr. Perlman.

07:35.421 --> 07:36.621
Oh, he was wonderful.

07:36.655 --> 07:38.523
Mm.

07:38.557 --> 07:41.125
Oh, Mrs. Weber,
this is Jim Ignatowski.

07:41.159 --> 07:42.760
How do you do,
                 Mr. Ignatowski?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.662
Hello.

07:44.696 --> 07:46.697
He's an attractive man, Elaine.

07:46.731 --> 07:49.801
If I were ten years younger,
  I'd steal him away from you.

07:49.835 --> 07:50.901
(Mrs. Weber giggles)

07:50.936 --> 07:52.870
(chuckles)

07:56.474 --> 08:00.344
It was nice meeting
            you, Mr. Ignatowski.

08:00.378 --> 08:02.446
Oh, I just
                  had a thought.

08:02.480 --> 08:04.482
I'm having a
             musicale on Sunday.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.717
Many of the creative community
     will be there, Elaine.

08:06.752 --> 08:08.018
I think you'd enjoy
         knowing them,

08:08.052 --> 08:10.054
and it'll give us
       a chance to talk.

08:10.088 --> 08:11.388
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Weber.

08:11.423 --> 08:12.623
I'd love to.

08:12.657 --> 08:14.158
Good. I'll expect both of you.

08:14.192 --> 08:16.294
Can I count on it?

08:16.328 --> 08:17.495
Well, I don't...

08:17.529 --> 08:20.331
You bet.

08:20.365 --> 08:23.067
It'll be 6:00, uh, formal.

08:23.101 --> 08:25.270
Call my secretary for
     directions, will you?

08:25.304 --> 08:28.640
I'm going home now to talk
   with cook about the menu.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.641
How does squab sound?

08:30.675 --> 08:33.344
Something like this.

08:33.379 --> 08:36.714
(cooing)

08:36.748 --> 08:38.683
(whispers):
Jim, please.

08:46.725 --> 08:48.158
What are you doing, Alex?

08:48.193 --> 08:50.895
I'm rapid reading.

08:50.929 --> 08:53.230
It's a new power reading method
I'm learning.

08:53.265 --> 08:54.265
Pretty impressive, isn't it?

08:54.299 --> 08:55.667
I'll say.

08:55.701 --> 08:56.934
Wow. What are
                    you reading?

08:56.969 --> 08:59.637
I have no idea.

08:59.671 --> 09:01.305
You don't know
       what you're reading?

09:01.340 --> 09:03.841
Not a word.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.075
Alex, I have a terrible problem.

09:05.110 --> 09:07.144
I have to talk to you.
ALEX: Yeah, just a minute,

09:07.178 --> 09:09.080
just a minute.
      I'm almost finished.

09:09.114 --> 09:10.481
I'll help.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.483
Anything need rubbing?

09:17.055 --> 09:18.355
Well, would you come on?

09:18.390 --> 09:20.325
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
   just a second, just a second.

09:20.359 --> 09:22.527
Okay, what?
      What's the problem?

09:22.561 --> 09:25.796
Last night at the concert,
     I ran into Elizabeth Weber.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.899
She's one of the most
  influential people in society,

09:28.933 --> 09:31.702
and she invited me to a party
     at her house where everyone

09:31.736 --> 09:34.339
who's anyone in the New York
        art world will be there.

09:34.373 --> 09:35.573
Get to the point, Elaine.

09:35.607 --> 09:37.841
Can't you see that I'm
in the middle of-- <i>Moby Dick?</i>

09:37.876 --> 09:39.110
Hey.

09:39.144 --> 09:42.246
Alex, the contacts I
       could make at this party,

09:42.280 --> 09:44.715
well, I'd need 20 years
       of working in the gallery

09:44.749 --> 09:46.183
to do something
                like that.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.453
I mean, my entire career could
be determined in this one night.

09:49.488 --> 09:50.888
My bosses aren't even invited.

09:50.922 --> 09:52.357
They would kill to be there.

09:52.391 --> 09:53.725
The point, Elaine,
get to the point.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.959
Shut up, Reiger, and
        she'll get to the point.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.928
Thank you.

10:01.600 --> 10:05.536
The point is, it's the most
important night of my life,

10:05.571 --> 10:08.573
and Jim has been invited
as my date.

10:08.607 --> 10:09.940
(laughs)

10:12.243 --> 10:14.511
I'm sorry, Elaine.

10:14.546 --> 10:16.814
I mean, I-I understand
your situation,

10:16.848 --> 10:17.915
because I can just realize

10:17.949 --> 10:20.651
what Jim might do
at an affair like that.

10:20.685 --> 10:22.052
Alex.
(chuckles):
I'm sorry.

10:22.087 --> 10:24.088
Come on, can't you see
the humor in this?

10:24.122 --> 10:25.889
There is no humor in this.

10:25.924 --> 10:28.058
Alex, you weren't there
 last night when the conductor

10:28.092 --> 10:31.763
walked down to the podium
and Jim yelled, "Down in front!"

10:31.797 --> 10:32.963
(Alex and Louie laughing)

10:32.997 --> 10:34.599
Stop it!

10:34.633 --> 10:35.833
Stop laughing at me,
          both of you!

10:35.868 --> 10:37.802
This is a problem
    and you're not helping!

10:37.836 --> 10:40.538
Okay, okay, Reiger,
       Reiger, enough is enough.

10:40.572 --> 10:41.639
Okay, okay.

10:41.673 --> 10:43.441
I'm sorry, Elaine,
I'm sorry.

10:43.475 --> 10:45.175
I don't mean
to sound unsympathetic,

10:45.210 --> 10:47.445
but, uh, all right,
  you do have a real problem.

10:47.479 --> 10:49.080
Yes.
Well, what are you
gonna do?

10:49.114 --> 10:50.414
I mean, all you can do is just

10:50.448 --> 10:52.183
go with him
     and hope for the best.

10:52.217 --> 10:53.283
Oh, the best?

10:53.318 --> 10:56.119
Alex, this is a man who,
       during the slow passages,

10:56.154 --> 10:58.889
rolled up his program and blew
      salted nuts into the tuba.

10:58.923 --> 11:00.191
(laughing)

11:02.360 --> 11:03.727
Aw, come on.

11:03.762 --> 11:05.830
Reiger, Reiger!

11:05.864 --> 11:07.498
Cut it out, huh?!

11:07.532 --> 11:09.300
Can't you see she's
             reaching out to us?

11:09.334 --> 11:10.601
I'm sorry, Elaine.

11:10.635 --> 11:12.804
LOUIE:
Come on, she's asking
our advice...

11:12.838 --> 11:15.106
Okay.
     ...because she doesn't want
        to hurt Iggy's feelings.

11:15.140 --> 11:16.173
Exactly.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.509
She cannot take him
to this party,

11:18.543 --> 11:21.378
because he'll obviously blow
       this opportunity for her.

11:21.412 --> 11:22.713
Yeah.
                      And she'll
                       regret it

11:22.747 --> 11:24.648
for the rest
                    of her life.

11:26.618 --> 11:29.921
God, look who understands me.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.595
You know the difference
    between people like you

11:38.630 --> 11:40.331
and people like me, Nardo?

11:40.365 --> 11:42.333
Yeah, two million years
of evolution.

11:42.367 --> 11:44.168
(laughing)

11:45.070 --> 11:48.839
Will you shut
                     up, Reiger?

11:48.873 --> 11:49.907
Go on, Louie.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.442
The difference is...

11:51.476 --> 11:54.512
that I... would dump him

11:54.546 --> 11:57.148
(snaps fingers)
without a second thought.

11:57.182 --> 11:59.350
You'd dump him,
but only after

11:59.352 --> 12:02.386
you tortured yourself
with guilt.
                        Oh, yes!

12:02.420 --> 12:06.357
Either way, it's
heartbreak hotel for Iggy.

12:06.391 --> 12:09.660
So, make it easy on yourself.

12:09.694 --> 12:11.963
Do what you have to do,

12:11.997 --> 12:13.965
but do it gentle...

12:13.999 --> 12:15.699
and quick.
(snaps fingers)

12:18.336 --> 12:20.471
Well, what do you know.

12:20.505 --> 12:21.973
Yeah.
                          Hmm.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.241
Not bad, huh?

12:24.242 --> 12:26.443
(quietly:
               Mm-hmm!

12:26.477 --> 12:29.013
Think you could've
        handled that any better?

12:29.047 --> 12:29.613
No.

12:29.648 --> 12:31.014
Oh, yes, I could have!

12:31.049 --> 12:32.216
Ha!

12:32.250 --> 12:33.551
Elaine...

12:33.585 --> 12:36.454
come on, y-you're getting
all worked up over nothing.

12:36.488 --> 12:37.755
I mean, you know Jim.

12:37.789 --> 12:39.490
If the invitation
was made yesterday,

12:39.524 --> 12:42.226
there's a good chance
he won't even remember
being invited.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.595
I'm sure he doesn't
care about this party.

12:44.629 --> 12:48.199
I-I'm sure that the whole thing
is completely forgotten by now.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.100
(laughs):
                  Yeah.

12:49.134 --> 12:52.436
JIM:
     ¶ Da-la-la, dum, dum

12:52.470 --> 12:54.238
¶ Puttin' on my ¶

12:54.272 --> 12:55.939
¶ Top hat

12:55.974 --> 12:58.776
¶ Tying up
my white tie ¶

12:58.810 --> 13:01.311
¶ Brushing up my tails...

13:01.346 --> 13:02.279
(snapping fingers)

13:02.313 --> 13:03.881
(chuckles)

13:03.915 --> 13:06.550
(big sigh)

13:07.452 --> 13:09.387
(quietly):
Gentle and quick.

13:09.421 --> 13:11.389
Oh, come on, will ya?

13:11.423 --> 13:14.292
Listen, Elaine,
just listen to me.

13:14.326 --> 13:16.561
What do you think?

13:16.595 --> 13:18.528
Gentle and quick.

13:20.932 --> 13:22.666
Did you rent
                    that outfit?

13:22.701 --> 13:24.802
Rent it? Nothing!
I bought it!

13:24.836 --> 13:28.105
The clerk told me that
it would pay for itself

13:28.140 --> 13:29.706
in six months

13:29.741 --> 13:34.779
if I became the Ambassador
to the Court of St. James.

13:34.813 --> 13:37.081
Well, it looks
                very nice on you

13:37.115 --> 13:40.084
and sort of gives you
       that devil-may-care look.

13:40.118 --> 13:41.919
How much did it cost?

13:41.953 --> 13:43.621
Well, who cares?

13:43.655 --> 13:47.124
¶ Da la da-da...

13:47.158 --> 13:51.361
Can I talk to you a minute?
               ¶ Da, da, da...
                   You bet.

13:51.396 --> 13:52.863
¶ Da-la-la, dum dum...

13:52.898 --> 13:54.665
Well...

13:54.699 --> 13:57.001
¶ Ba-la-la, dee,
                   dee, dee... ¶

13:57.035 --> 13:59.503
This would be a lot easier
without the humming.

13:59.537 --> 14:02.106
It sure would.
                    Where's that
                    coming from?

14:03.574 --> 14:05.542
(humming melody)

14:05.576 --> 14:07.611
From you.

14:07.645 --> 14:09.213
Oh.
(uneasy chuckle)

14:09.247 --> 14:10.948
Huh.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.483
Um...

14:13.852 --> 14:16.520
I want to thank you
again for last night.

14:16.554 --> 14:18.522
I-I really did
have a lovely time.

14:18.556 --> 14:20.324
So did I.

14:21.793 --> 14:24.395
A concert, right?

14:24.429 --> 14:26.130
Yeah, the concert.

14:26.164 --> 14:28.132
Good.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.634
Jim, how would you feel

14:30.668 --> 14:33.137
if I asked you...

14:33.171 --> 14:37.541
if... I could go
to the party by myself?

14:37.575 --> 14:40.311
Why, sure, we can
                  meet up there.

14:42.514 --> 14:43.981
No. I mean...

14:44.015 --> 14:46.684
what if I asked you
not to go at all?

14:46.718 --> 14:47.919
Oh, oh, oh.

14:47.953 --> 14:50.053
It would kill me.

14:53.091 --> 14:54.625
Well, um...

14:54.659 --> 14:56.794
I could make it up to you.

14:56.828 --> 14:59.964
W-We could go
to a movie sometime.

14:59.998 --> 15:01.565
A movie?

15:01.599 --> 15:04.335
Yeah, we could
dress up for it, too.

15:04.369 --> 15:06.136
For a movie?

15:06.171 --> 15:07.437
Yeah.

15:08.539 --> 15:10.307
Oh, yeah. Oh.

15:11.709 --> 15:13.077
Yeah, I-I understand.

15:13.111 --> 15:14.879
Uh...

15:14.913 --> 15:16.047
it's okay.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.115
You go ahead. Uh...

15:18.149 --> 15:20.418
Yeah.

15:20.452 --> 15:24.021
We'll go to a movie sometime.

15:24.055 --> 15:26.424
I promise you.
                      All right.

15:32.697 --> 15:35.633
Tell me all
                about the party.

15:37.669 --> 15:39.603
I will.

15:50.014 --> 15:53.283
Jim, how about going
to that party with me?

15:54.786 --> 15:56.120
Oh.

15:56.154 --> 15:58.622
Uh, what'll I wear?

16:07.165 --> 16:10.133
Now, Jim,
                  just remember,

16:10.168 --> 16:12.570
with these people,
            it's best to listen.

16:12.604 --> 16:14.538
They love to talk.

16:14.572 --> 16:17.274
A-a good listener
              will be a big hit.

16:18.276 --> 16:21.111
Don't worry, Elaine,
I'll make you proud.

16:21.145 --> 16:23.814
Aw. Just be
                  careful, okay?
         Uh-huh.

16:23.848 --> 16:25.716
I mean, with these
                kinds of people,

16:25.750 --> 16:28.419
even I don't know
           how to act sometimes.

16:28.453 --> 16:32.422
Well, then let me
give you a little advice.

16:33.658 --> 16:36.426
When you're talking
to these highbrows,

16:36.461 --> 16:38.829
and they get you confused,

16:38.863 --> 16:42.299
the best thing to do
is to stay calm

16:42.333 --> 16:44.467
and make small talk.

16:44.502 --> 16:48.205
But... if someone
says something

16:48.239 --> 16:50.573
really baffling to you,

16:50.608 --> 16:54.577
simply laugh knowingly
and walk away.

16:55.680 --> 16:56.980
Oh, Mrs.
                   Weber, hello.

16:57.014 --> 16:59.316
And, Mr. Ignatowski,
how are you this evening?

16:59.350 --> 17:01.318
Uh...
           (clears throat)

17:01.352 --> 17:03.287
Nice weather we're having.

17:03.321 --> 17:06.924
Ah. Wouldn't it be wonderful
if it could always be this nice?

17:06.958 --> 17:09.626
(mumbling):
    Oh... yeah.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.601
Come, Elaine,

17:17.635 --> 17:19.502
there's some people
I want to introduce you to.

17:21.939 --> 17:23.941
Maybe I've become
                   too cautious,

17:23.974 --> 17:26.944
or even jaded,

17:26.978 --> 17:29.279
but then every
                heartbreak seems

17:29.313 --> 17:30.948
to take a little
                 more out of me,

17:30.982 --> 17:33.617
and I-I never
                  fully recover.

17:33.651 --> 17:36.220
Well, who does?
                      Oh.

17:36.254 --> 17:38.155
Isn't that the truth?

17:38.189 --> 17:41.158
I suppose no one
                    really does.

17:41.192 --> 17:43.160
So, why risk the pain?

17:43.194 --> 17:44.662
I mean, is it worth it?

17:44.696 --> 17:46.163
Is anything worth it?

17:46.197 --> 17:47.998
Who knows?

17:48.032 --> 17:49.133
(chuckles)

17:49.167 --> 17:52.136
So why worry about
               it at all, right?

17:52.170 --> 17:54.104
Right.

17:58.610 --> 18:01.378
Oh, you have a very
                  sensitive man.

18:01.412 --> 18:03.881
Don't lose him.

18:03.915 --> 18:07.717
Thank you so much for letting me
  unburden myself on you, Jim.

18:07.752 --> 18:10.854
Do you mind if I give him
           a little kiss?

18:10.888 --> 18:12.790
No, I don't mind.

18:15.927 --> 18:19.563
(whispering):
             Baby, why don't you
             and I get together?

18:19.597 --> 18:21.198
What?

18:22.166 --> 18:24.135
What?

18:30.808 --> 18:32.843
What were you two
talking about?

18:32.877 --> 18:34.811
(dry chuckle)

18:34.846 --> 18:36.813
(clears throat)

18:36.847 --> 18:39.816
Beats me.

18:39.850 --> 18:42.786
It's getting so I can
             listen to anything.

18:44.288 --> 18:46.524
You're doing a fine job
tonight.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.626
Thank you.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.694
WEBER:
        Oh, my dearest,

18:50.728 --> 18:52.028
I'm so embarrassed,

18:52.063 --> 18:53.563
I don't know
                     what to do.

18:53.598 --> 18:54.898
The pianist
                hasn't shown up,

18:54.933 --> 18:56.900
and I promised these
           people entertainment.

18:56.935 --> 18:58.435
Where could I go

18:58.469 --> 19:00.604
to substitute for someone
              at this late hour?

19:00.638 --> 19:02.405
You're looking at him.

19:02.440 --> 19:03.507
WEBER:
              Oh!

19:03.541 --> 19:04.942
Jim...

19:04.976 --> 19:07.744
Oh, Mr. Ignatowski, you?

19:07.778 --> 19:10.047
I'd be delighted

19:10.081 --> 19:12.383
to help you out
                of a tight spot.

19:12.417 --> 19:13.917
Oh, no, no, no,
no, Jim.

19:13.951 --> 19:15.953
He's just kidding, really.

19:15.987 --> 19:17.421
ELAINE:
He-he loves to kid.

19:17.455 --> 19:19.423
(chuckling):
Oh, she...

19:19.457 --> 19:21.425
Oh, she's right.

19:21.459 --> 19:24.328
But I am dead serious.

19:24.362 --> 19:26.630
Oh, oh, thank you, thank you.

19:26.664 --> 19:29.466
Uh, my friends, will you
        take your seats, please?

19:29.500 --> 19:30.334
Jim, you really
                don't mean this.

19:30.368 --> 19:31.602
I mean, come on, we....
                         Elaine,

19:31.636 --> 19:33.337
please, dear, will you
sit right over here?

19:33.371 --> 19:34.672
Thank you, dear.

19:36.841 --> 19:38.275
(Weber clears throat)

19:38.309 --> 19:41.712
WEBER:
    Although this evening's
    performer is indisposed,

19:41.746 --> 19:45.149
one of our guests has agreed
     to act as substitute--

19:45.183 --> 19:48.452
Mr. James Ignatowski.

19:48.486 --> 19:50.187
(applause)

19:50.221 --> 19:52.556
And we have Miss Elaine Nardo,

19:52.590 --> 19:55.926
as our sponsor and for our
     good fortune to thank.

19:55.960 --> 19:56.860
Hear, hear.

19:56.894 --> 19:59.563
Uh, stand up,
Elaine.

20:02.433 --> 20:04.368
Thank you.

20:04.402 --> 20:06.337
(sotto voce):
          I wish I were dead.

20:08.206 --> 20:11.241
My impression

20:11.275 --> 20:13.343
of a water cooler.

20:16.414 --> 20:18.749
(gurgling)

20:25.323 --> 20:26.624
(belches loudly)

20:31.529 --> 20:34.231
You ain't seen nothing yet.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.167
He's a veteran!
        Oh.

20:43.507 --> 20:47.945
And now,
  for you mime enthusiasts...

20:49.848 --> 20:53.317
...here's one that never fails
          to delight.

20:53.351 --> 20:54.250
These people--

20:54.285 --> 20:55.418
this is not what
             they wanted to see.

20:55.452 --> 20:56.586
They wanted
                  to hear music.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.388
Well, why didn't
they say so?

20:58.422 --> 20:59.590
Jim, why don't
                  we just leave?
I'll give it...

20:59.624 --> 21:00.991
I'll give it a shot.

21:01.025 --> 21:03.160
Please, can't we...
(mumbles)

21:07.666 --> 21:09.700
(Jim inhales deeply)

21:09.734 --> 21:10.467
(exhaling)

21:10.501 --> 21:13.437
Here goes.

21:13.471 --> 21:17.774
(playing "London Bridge
   Is Falling Down" off-key)
