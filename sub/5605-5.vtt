00:41.567 --> 00:43.300
How did you pay for this?

00:43.302 --> 00:46.069
I used the money Aunt Doris
left me when she died.

00:46.071 --> 00:50.339
Well, now I feel bad for
napping during that funeral.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.174
Well, I wanted
to get you a bazooka,

00:52.176 --> 00:54.843
but, apparently,
there are laws.

00:54.845 --> 00:57.011
So, you had the same car,
right?

00:57.013 --> 01:00.347
So you were an old man
even when you were young.

01:00.349 --> 01:02.816
Yeah, your dad had a hard time
giving that up.

01:02.818 --> 01:04.818
But once we got pregnant
with Kristin,

01:04.820 --> 01:07.187
he sold it so we could get
a bigger apartment.

Wow, so that explains

01:08.557 --> 01:11.190
that look you give me
from time to time.

01:11.192 --> 01:14.026
And I'm still not sure
I made the right decision.

we bought it from

to outdoor man.

it might need a little work.

hanging out with me.

12:03.547 --> 12:05.046
Don't deny it.

reminded me of your mother.

Yeah, it turns out
this was just a misunderstanding

19:02.955 --> 19:04.120
between friends.

19:04.122 --> 19:07.490
Joe had the misunderstanding
that we were friends.

19:07.492 --> 19:09.825
So, no more Joe?

19:09.827 --> 19:11.993
Geez, I was afraid that
once you saw his garage,

19:11.995 --> 19:13.861
it would be no more Vanessa.
[ Chuckles ]

19:13.863 --> 19:16.296
Yeah, but that pit --
that pit is just dangerous.

19:16.298 --> 19:18.464
Someone's gonna fall in that pit
and hurt themselves.

19:18.466 --> 19:21.333
Damn, I wish I had a pit.

19:21.335 --> 19:24.336
You know, Mike, we could fix up
our garage if you want.

19:24.338 --> 19:26.171
We could
take the kids' bikes

19:26.173 --> 19:28.573
and the Christmas decorations
out of there

19:28.575 --> 19:31.509
and move the washer
and the dryer into the basement.

19:31.511 --> 19:34.178
Might be the perfect place
for Mike time.

19:34.180 --> 19:35.245
You'd do that for me?

19:35.247 --> 19:36.412
Yeah, yeah. If you like.

19:36.414 --> 19:38.714
Um, sure.

19:38.716 --> 19:41.149
Just think about it.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.750
I did think about it.

19:42.752 --> 19:44.184
[ Laughs ] Okay.

19:44.186 --> 19:47.520
That was a little longer
than I expected.

19:47.522 --> 19:48.754
I will call the plumber

19:48.756 --> 19:50.922
and have him move the laundry
to the basement.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.189
Nah, I don't want to do it.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.324
I thought about it, and I like
the garage the way it is.

19:54.326 --> 19:55.992
I like having all that
family stuff there.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.793
Okay.

20:00.030 --> 20:01.996
Uh, what?

20:01.998 --> 20:04.732
I'm probably
going to regret this.

20:04.734 --> 20:06.533
But why don't you
get us some beers,

20:06.535 --> 20:07.700
come on out the garage.

20:07.702 --> 20:11.837
I'll work on the car
and we can talk.

20:11.839 --> 20:13.038
That'd be great.

20:13.040 --> 20:15.607
Good.

20:15.609 --> 20:21.212
You, uh, sure there's enough
"vroom" for me out there?

20:21.214 --> 20:24.481
Yes, honey, there's plenty of
"vroom" out there.

20:33.124 --> 20:35.090
Hey, Mike Baxter
here for outdoor man.

20:35.092 --> 20:36.391
The invention of the wheel

20:36.393 --> 20:38.192
dates back
to the neolithic period,

20:38.194 --> 20:40.227
about 6500 b.C.

20:40.229 --> 20:42.462
Over 8,000 years
of accidents later,

20:42.464 --> 20:44.864
Fred Lanchester invented
the disc brake

20:44.866 --> 20:45.898
and put a stop to that.

20:45.900 --> 20:46.899
[ Chuckles ]

20:46.901 --> 20:48.567
It wasn't long
before automobiles

20:48.569 --> 20:51.970
fulfilled their true purpose --
impressing Monica Kendall

20:51.972 --> 20:55.139
doing donuts
in the 7-Eleven parking lot.

20:55.141 --> 20:57.741
There was a time when I couldn't
imagine anything better

20:57.743 --> 21:00.110
than cruising around
with my high-school sweetheart.

21:00.112 --> 21:03.379
But then you drive your first
daughter home from the hospital,

21:03.381 --> 21:06.382
you drive your middle daughter
home from her first school play,

21:06.384 --> 21:09.418
and you drive your youngest
to a soccer practice.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.319
And your beautiful wife
gets in the car,

21:11.321 --> 21:15.922
and you think, "really,
you couldn't give me one son?"

21:15.924 --> 21:18.591
A man might be a 427 big block.

21:18.593 --> 21:19.725
Yowzer.

21:19.727 --> 21:21.593
But his family is the wheels.

21:21.595 --> 21:24.762
And he's not going anywhere
without his family.

21:24.764 --> 21:26.697
Believe me. I've tried.
