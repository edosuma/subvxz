00:32.537 --> 00:33.574
Thank you, darling.

00:34.675 --> 00:35.641
When can we get out of here?

00:35.643 --> 00:36.642
I'm almost done.

00:36.644 --> 00:40.911
Oh my god, this isn't
even due until next week.

00:40.913 --> 00:42.821
I'll kill you. I will kill you!
It's my first

00:42.831 --> 00:44.749
solo gig. I've got
to impress everyone.

00:44.751 --> 00:46.677
Just wear some low-cut
tops next week, that

00:46.687 --> 00:48.623
should do the trick for
"Brian the Brainless".

00:52.893 --> 00:55.893
So, where's Matt?

00:55.895 --> 00:59.798
Yes, where is Matt? The 99
million dollar question.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.800
Oh, speak of the Devil.

01:02.769 --> 01:05.006
No. It literally is the Devil.

01:09.009 --> 01:13.578
One of the rare times you may
have spoken too soon - He's here!

01:13.580 --> 01:15.814
- What's up Jack?
- Hi Matt! - How are you?

01:15.816 --> 01:18.708
Better now that you're here
and we can get away from the

01:18.718 --> 01:21.620
army of trust fund interns.
Have you been working out?

01:21.622 --> 01:22.853
No more than usual?

01:22.855 --> 01:24.823
So, none at all. None at all.

01:24.825 --> 01:26.058
He's being facetious - Hi.

01:26.060 --> 01:27.060
Hi.

01:27.961 --> 01:28.927
Let me get you a drink.

01:28.929 --> 01:29.929
You're gonna hate me.

01:31.331 --> 01:33.601
One of our ad execs
just got into town.

01:34.968 --> 01:37.338
I envy how much make-up
sex you two must have.

01:38.405 --> 01:39.438
He's a big client, Bon.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.606
Bigger than the one who
was in town last week?

01:41.608 --> 01:43.966
Yeah, that was - It's not going
to be that late, though.

01:43.976 --> 01:46.344
I might be able to link up
with you guys later on?

01:46.346 --> 01:48.548
Oh fun! I won't hold my breath.

01:53.486 --> 01:58.022
Hey, you know, sometimes you're here
until like 9:00PM on a weekend.

01:58.024 --> 02:04.495
Yeah, well, at least you know where I am
and not snorting blow off a hooker's butt.

02:04.497 --> 02:06.764
Yeah, is that really what
you think we're doing?

02:06.766 --> 02:08.633
I watch "Madmen".

02:08.636 --> 02:10.810
Babe, it's not the 60's. It's
- Trust me, it's

02:10.820 --> 02:13.003
not that fun, it ends
up being bunch of dudes

02:13.005 --> 02:15.799
watching football
highlights and playing

02:15.809 --> 02:18.612
Beer Pong till they pass out.
It's pathetic.

02:21.447 --> 02:22.546
You ok?

02:22.548 --> 02:26.485
- Yeah...
- You just - you just miss me? - Yeah.

02:26.487 --> 02:28.728
I can tell. I know, I miss you too!
And I'm

02:28.738 --> 02:30.989
also exhausted, do we
have plans tomorrow?

02:30.991 --> 02:31.990
No, nothing on the books.

02:31.992 --> 02:34.526
Good, good. Let's just
do nothing except be

02:34.528 --> 02:36.660
with each other. We can
even like, turn off our

02:36.662 --> 02:38.864
phones, you know,
kick it 90's style?

02:38.866 --> 02:40.632
For the entire day?

02:40.634 --> 02:41.800
Yep, the whole day.

02:41.802 --> 02:43.602
Oh my God, that's
so romantic of you.

02:43.604 --> 02:44.971
It's just how I was raised.

02:46.874 --> 02:47.973
Forgive me?

02:47.975 --> 02:48.975
Maybe.

02:49.308 --> 02:50.709
Well I can make it up to you.

02:50.711 --> 02:51.779
Get out of here.

02:53.147 --> 02:53.812
I love you.

02:53.814 --> 02:54.712
I love you, too.

02:54.714 --> 02:55.546
Don't drink too much!

02:55.548 --> 02:56.583
I will!

04:39.052 --> 04:40.218
You okay?

04:40.220 --> 04:43.053
Some guy just tried to creep
on me on the dance floor.

04:43.055 --> 04:46.992
This place is getting so gross. I
even got an ass grab in the bathroom.

04:46.994 --> 04:48.994
And you're complaining?

04:48.996 --> 04:54.766
No, I'll take whatever I can get right now.
And apparently, so will she.

04:54.768 --> 04:56.571
Oh wow!

05:05.011 --> 05:07.678
I'm the best friend.
I'm the greatest.

05:07.680 --> 05:08.613
You are. You're the
reason we all get laid.

05:08.615 --> 05:12.182
Oh, that's so sweet!
I love you so much!

05:12.184 --> 05:12.917
I love you so -

05:12.919 --> 05:15.690
I love you more,
I love you more.

05:23.196 --> 05:24.028
I love you.

05:24.030 --> 05:24.495
Bye.

05:24.497 --> 05:26.131
Bye. Watch her.

05:26.133 --> 05:28.300
You're the prettiest girl
that I've ever seen.

05:28.302 --> 05:29.367
Shut up!

05:29.369 --> 05:31.870
Bye. I'm just kidding.
You're the prettiest. Bye!

05:31.872 --> 05:33.939
Ugh. Let's go get one more?

05:33.941 --> 05:37.367
No, I think I'm gonna go
home and lie on the floor,

05:37.377 --> 05:40.812
and listen to Tina Turner's
'77 Australian Tour.

05:40.814 --> 05:43.314
Oh, I take it there's
been no word from Brad?

05:43.316 --> 05:46.685
Radio silence since Monday. I
think it's officially over.

05:46.687 --> 05:48.019
Sorry.

05:48.021 --> 05:52.257
It's ok. Honestly, Tina, "what
does love have to do with it?"

05:52.259 --> 05:55.726
No! No. Don't torture yourself.

05:55.728 --> 05:57.008
Why? It's my favorite past time.

05:58.598 --> 05:59.730
Are you gonna grab a cab?

05:59.732 --> 06:01.298
Yeah, you wanna splitsies?

06:01.300 --> 06:04.134
Mm, no. I think I'm gonna walk.

06:04.136 --> 06:06.271
Ok, well, I'll see you Monday.
Love you.

06:06.273 --> 06:07.004
Love you more.

06:07.006 --> 06:10.011
Bye. I love you more, bitch!

06:28.996 --> 06:36.067
Mi vida! Hi, hey listen, Jimmy managed
to get us a table at Marquee. So, yeah -

06:36.069 --> 06:40.805
It's gonna be a late one. Sorry. I swear
there's no butts, there's no coke.

06:40.807 --> 06:44.145
Um. Ok baby, I love you.
Have a fun night.

07:46.138 --> 07:48.175
I will fucking kill you.
You got it?

07:53.814 --> 07:55.947
No, please. Take
whatever you want - my

07:55.949 --> 07:57.848
phone. Just please,
don't do that.

07:57.850 --> 07:58.716
Please. Please.

07:58.718 --> 07:59.718
Please.

11:57.089 --> 12:00.059
"Getting off the subway now."

13:45.732 --> 13:46.732
Hey.

13:47.601 --> 13:53.171
What's up? What's wrong?
Hey? Whoa. Whoa! Hey!

13:53.173 --> 13:55.673
You ok? What happened?

13:55.675 --> 14:00.577
Baby? Baby, look at me.
What happened?

14:00.579 --> 14:08.251
Let me see your face. Let me see - Oh
my God. What the fuck? Who did that?

14:08.253 --> 14:13.157
What happened? What fucking happened, baby?
Did someone fucking hit you?

14:13.159 --> 14:15.362
Talk to me, please.
Baby, talk to me?

14:18.098 --> 14:20.630
I don't know what to do -
just fucking talk to me.

14:20.632 --> 14:21.365
I got mugged.

14:21.367 --> 14:24.668
When? Just now? Are you serious?

14:24.670 --> 14:28.239
They fucking hit you?!
What the fuck!

14:28.241 --> 14:34.778
What a fucking piece of shit.
Fuck, I'm so sorry. Baby.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.516
I think I need to
go to the hospital.

14:37.684 --> 14:38.684
Really?

14:39.251 --> 14:40.118
Did you call the cops?

14:40.120 --> 14:43.520
No. Please don't get
mad, let's just go.

14:43.522 --> 14:47.658
Ok. No no no, yeah yeah yeah.
I'm so sorry. Ok, alright?

14:47.660 --> 14:48.660
Yeah.

14:53.699 --> 14:56.533
Can you describe the person
who attacked you for us?

14:56.535 --> 14:58.405
I didn't - I didn't get
a good look at him.

15:00.339 --> 15:01.339
Was he tall?

15:02.074 --> 15:06.443
Yeah. Maybe 6 feet?
He was strong.

15:06.445 --> 15:09.749
He had - sharp stubble.

15:12.151 --> 15:13.417
Black, white, hispanic?

15:13.419 --> 15:16.254
He was white. Maybe a mix?

15:16.256 --> 15:17.256
When did he do that?

15:17.689 --> 15:18.689
When I bit his hand.

15:20.693 --> 15:25.332
What did he take from you? What
are you missing? Your phone?

15:26.900 --> 15:28.367
No, I have my phone.

15:29.202 --> 15:30.604
Money? Credit Cards?

15:34.607 --> 15:38.312
Bonnie, did he sexually
assault you in any way?

15:45.584 --> 15:48.619
Why don't you sit down? It's
best if you just sit down.

15:48.621 --> 15:51.422
Alright - Alright.

15:51.424 --> 15:53.857
Can I have a glass
of water, please?

15:53.859 --> 15:57.530
We can't give you water until after
the exam, to preserve the evidence.

16:05.872 --> 16:09.472
I wiped myself with the tissues.
My underwear is in there, too.

16:09.474 --> 16:11.177
That's really helpful, Bonnie.

16:13.813 --> 16:15.947
How much did you have to drink?

16:15.949 --> 16:19.749
Um, I dunno - like four
drinks or something.

16:19.751 --> 16:20.751
Four?

16:24.390 --> 16:29.427
It was... maybe 7. But like - over
the course of - like, 5 hours.

16:29.429 --> 16:31.328
Beer? Cocktails?

16:31.330 --> 16:32.598
Shots and mixed drinks.

16:33.699 --> 16:35.268
So it's more like -
12 drinks, right?

16:37.237 --> 16:39.537
Did you willingly
take any drugs?

16:39.539 --> 16:40.539
What is this -?

16:41.306 --> 16:42.907
You won't get in any trouble.

16:42.909 --> 16:45.879
Um, I had a little - a
little bump of cocaine.

16:48.514 --> 16:52.504
Listen, these guys, they
prey on drunk girls. It's

16:52.514 --> 16:56.514
their number one M.O.
Makes it easier for them.

16:56.521 --> 17:00.857
Can you remember anybody at the bar
that was suspicious? Anything?

17:00.859 --> 17:05.296
Um, there was one guy who
kept trying to dance with me?

17:05.298 --> 17:07.030
Could this have been the
man who attacked you?

17:07.031 --> 17:10.300
I don't know. I didn't
really look at him.

17:10.301 --> 17:14.305
That's absolutely fine. That's why
we collect all the other evidence.

17:14.307 --> 17:17.339
Where was your boyfriend
at the time of the attack?

17:17.342 --> 17:19.744
He was out with some
- work colleagues.

17:22.647 --> 17:27.351
The guy took my license. He
took - he took my license.

17:27.353 --> 17:28.752
He won't come - he's just
trying to frighten you.

17:28.754 --> 17:30.454
But he could, right?

17:30.456 --> 17:35.992
He won't. We'll put some patrol cars in
your neighborhood. You'll - you'll be fine.

17:35.994 --> 17:37.231
Excuse us, please.

17:38.464 --> 17:42.432
Sorry, but we have to ask Matt
to leave the room, as well.

17:42.434 --> 17:45.504
Ok. I'll just be outside.

18:52.704 --> 18:56.710
[MUFFLED] I have to get all the way up to
the cervix. So It's going to hurt a bit.

19:02.948 --> 19:05.048
Did he penetrate you anally?

19:05.050 --> 19:06.050
No.

19:16.162 --> 19:18.632
Ok, we're all done.
You can sit up now.

19:41.921 --> 19:43.957
Alright, we can get
you some x-rays now.

19:57.203 --> 19:57.867
Hey.

19:57.869 --> 19:58.869
Hey.

20:17.656 --> 20:20.314
I'm sorry - I'm sorry that
I wasn't with you, you

20:20.324 --> 20:22.992
know. If I had been there
- if I had been with you.

20:22.994 --> 20:24.127
Matt, please please
please, not now.

20:24.129 --> 20:26.999
Ok, sorry. What did they say?

20:28.033 --> 20:30.134
- It's not broken.
- That's good.

20:30.136 --> 20:35.005
Yeah. They gave my stitches in my mouth.
Where I bit my cheek.

20:35.007 --> 20:36.207
I have your discharge papers.

20:36.209 --> 20:37.209
Great.

20:38.911 --> 20:42.149
So first I have your
pregnancy prophylaxis.

20:43.683 --> 20:44.882
I'm sorry - what is that?

20:44.884 --> 20:47.053
This is your morning after pill.
Just in case.

20:49.222 --> 20:52.130
These are all
precautionary, Bonnie. The

20:52.140 --> 20:55.058
chances of anything
happening are really slim.

20:55.060 --> 20:58.828
This is your HIV prophylaxis -
you have to take this once a

20:58.830 --> 21:00.029
day, for 28 days

21:00.031 --> 21:02.532
straight, for it to
be most effective.

21:02.534 --> 21:05.134
Now, I've also called you in
some anti-nausea medication,

21:05.136 --> 21:06.636
'cause this tend to make people
feel a little sick, it could

21:06.638 --> 21:08.638
induce vomiting.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.333
But I'm going to give you
your Tetanus and Hepatitis

21:11.343 --> 21:14.046
B vaccinations right
now, before you leave.

21:16.781 --> 21:20.150
The police have also asked if you
could take them to the crime scene.

21:20.152 --> 21:21.050
When, now?

21:21.052 --> 21:22.786
That's ridiculous, I mean -

21:22.788 --> 21:24.996
I - I understand, but
the scene could become

21:25.006 --> 21:27.223
contaminated or
disturbed if they wait.

21:27.225 --> 21:30.294
No, I'm not going back there.
I'll draw them a fucking map.

21:30.296 --> 21:31.095
That's fine. It's up to her.

21:31.097 --> 21:32.665
Ok, ok good.

21:35.967 --> 21:39.545
Bonnie, my card's in there,
you can call me anytime. And

21:39.555 --> 21:43.142
there's some numbers for some
free therapy services, too.

21:46.646 --> 21:47.646
Just one more quick jab.

21:52.184 --> 21:53.487
Ok. All done.

21:54.185 --> 21:55.185
Let's get out of here.

22:25.216 --> 22:27.651
Oh, you're awake.

22:27.653 --> 22:28.786
Yeah, I just woke up.

22:28.788 --> 22:29.990
Ok. Hold on.

22:38.364 --> 22:40.364
What is all this?

22:40.366 --> 22:43.792
I got you blueberry
pancakes and granola from

22:43.802 --> 22:47.237
Lighthouse. And there's coffee, too.
You want coffee?

22:47.239 --> 22:50.242
I didn't realize this was a
"breakfast in bed" situation.

22:52.011 --> 22:57.181
I'm kidding, relax. Can you
go get my painkillers?

22:57.183 --> 22:59.083
Yeah, which ones do you need?

22:59.085 --> 23:00.654
All of them.

23:14.966 --> 23:18.935
Alright, here's coffee. And here's.
I brought everything.

23:18.937 --> 23:19.937
OK.

23:26.044 --> 23:27.044
Here.

23:28.914 --> 23:29.914
Thank you.

23:43.896 --> 23:45.929
How's your - How's it
- How's it feel?

23:45.931 --> 23:47.371
I feel like I've
been hit by a truck.

23:52.672 --> 23:55.673
I don't - I don't think I can
get through granola today.

23:55.675 --> 23:56.842
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

24:03.415 --> 24:04.415
What?

24:05.350 --> 24:06.350
What?

24:08.020 --> 24:12.855
Are you just going to sit here and watch me
eat? The show's not about to start, Matt.

24:12.857 --> 24:16.000
Sorry. They just told me at
the hospital that I need to

24:16.010 --> 24:19.163
reinforce, like, a positive
male influence in your life.

24:19.165 --> 24:21.365
I don't think you're
supposed to tell me that.

24:21.367 --> 24:22.402
Yeah. Probably not.

24:23.402 --> 24:25.939
It's okay. It's okay, sit down.

24:29.308 --> 24:32.133
Look I know this is
really weird and

24:32.143 --> 24:34.978
uncomfortable, and I don't
know what to say, but -

24:34.980 --> 24:36.980
just try and be yourself, okay?

24:36.982 --> 24:38.182
Sure. Sorry.

24:38.184 --> 24:39.719
And stop apologizing.

24:45.023 --> 24:46.423
Are you ever going
to kiss me again?

24:46.425 --> 24:48.858
I'm dying to kiss you. I
just don't want to hurt you.

24:48.860 --> 24:49.860
I can handle it.

25:00.338 --> 25:06.175
You're, uh, you're mom called
while you were asleep.

25:06.177 --> 25:09.683
I think that she has, like, a
sixth sense for this stuff.

25:11.916 --> 25:14.116
I don't think I'm going to
tell her about what happened.

25:15.921 --> 25:16.921
Really?

25:18.223 --> 25:21.761
Just with all the stuff with my
Dad and everything and - I dunno.

25:24.329 --> 25:25.329
They're your parents.

25:28.166 --> 25:31.067
I mean, don't you think that they would
want to know something like this?

25:31.069 --> 25:34.195
I just know my mother will go crazy.
She'll say all the

25:34.205 --> 25:37.340
wrong things, and probably
just use it as ammunition.

25:37.342 --> 25:39.244
Yeah. That's - your call.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.183
Here, I'll get it.

25:44.149 --> 25:46.118
Not - not so hungry? Okay.

27:16.541 --> 27:17.810
Are you ok?

27:18.978 --> 27:19.978
What?

27:20.412 --> 27:21.944
Do you need help?

27:21.946 --> 27:22.946
I'm fine.

27:23.948 --> 27:25.788
Look, if you need me to
call the cops, I can...

27:29.421 --> 27:30.421
Let's go.

27:30.556 --> 27:31.716
Yeah, it'll just be a minute.

27:42.033 --> 27:43.168
Hey, what's wrong?

27:44.069 --> 27:45.469
Everyone is looking at my face.

27:45.471 --> 27:47.070
Come on. No they're not.

27:47.072 --> 27:50.507
The waitress in there asked if I needed
help. She thinks you did this to me.

27:50.509 --> 27:51.509
What?

27:55.547 --> 27:57.114
Who cares what they think?

27:57.116 --> 27:58.116
I do!

28:03.422 --> 28:04.924
Let's just go home.

28:06.125 --> 28:11.327
Hey, no. Here, here. Just put this on.
There you go.

28:11.329 --> 28:13.262
I look stupid in hats.

28:13.264 --> 28:15.033
It's Brooklyn,
nobody gives a shit.

28:16.568 --> 28:19.469
You look like the last kid
picked for the softball team.

28:19.471 --> 28:20.569
Shut up.

28:20.571 --> 28:24.209
"I'm just out here in leftfield,
waiting for the ball."

28:28.313 --> 28:31.516
Hey, you know what? Why don't we go to the
movies? No one can see us in the dark.

28:56.508 --> 28:57.508
You're going to work?

28:58.342 --> 29:01.278
I have to. The Speakeasy
job is due Friday.

29:01.280 --> 29:04.448
No. Don't you think you
should take another day off?

29:04.450 --> 29:06.843
No. It's too big of a job.
And I don't want

29:06.853 --> 29:09.255
to just mope around the
house another day.

29:12.491 --> 29:19.628
We don't have to mope. We could - we could
go to the park, we could have a picnic.

29:19.630 --> 29:22.699
I already emailed the team last
night and said I'm not coming in.

29:22.701 --> 29:24.002
What did you tell them?

29:25.404 --> 29:28.040
That you're sick and I
have to take care of you?

29:32.144 --> 29:36.134
Look, I know you're itching
to get back to it,

29:36.144 --> 29:40.144
but I don't think, you
know, you should rush it.

29:40.551 --> 29:43.119
Just one more day. That
won't hurt, would it?

29:43.121 --> 29:44.223
Mentally? Yes.

29:48.059 --> 29:50.495
Well, do the people at work
even know what happened?

29:55.166 --> 29:57.046
Let's just tell everyone
it was a mugging, okay?

30:00.438 --> 30:02.105
You're not even
going to tell Jack?

30:02.107 --> 30:02.905
And have him ask me for all the details?
No, thank you.

30:02.907 --> 30:04.840
Oh, come on. He
wouldn't do that.

30:04.842 --> 30:06.692
I just can't even fathom
telling people something

30:06.702 --> 30:08.562
like that. I wouldn't
even know what to say.

30:32.738 --> 30:37.307
Mate, how you doin'? That's
crazy, what happened to ya.

30:37.309 --> 30:38.442
I know.

30:38.444 --> 30:39.444
Where'd it happen?

30:40.178 --> 30:41.845
Just three blocks
away from my place.

30:41.847 --> 30:43.380
Look at that shiner!

30:43.382 --> 30:46.115
Oh, you should see
the other guy.

30:46.117 --> 30:47.317
So what did he take?

30:47.319 --> 30:49.352
Just some cash and credit cards.

30:49.354 --> 30:50.619
What a fucking prick.

30:50.621 --> 30:51.621
Yeah.

30:52.723 --> 30:56.125
Oh my God, Bonnie,
you look awful.

30:56.127 --> 30:58.694
I think what she means
is: "you look bad ass."

30:58.696 --> 31:01.698
Yeah, that's - that's what I meant.
Where did it happen?

31:01.700 --> 31:03.767
Just three blocks
from my apartment.

31:03.769 --> 31:05.335
Were you wearing
your headphones?

31:05.337 --> 31:06.236
I always walk without my
headphones at night for

31:06.238 --> 31:08.038
this exact reason.

31:08.040 --> 31:11.874
Well, you know what they say, you're not a
real New Yorker till you've been mugged.

31:11.876 --> 31:12.709
Is that what they say?

31:12.711 --> 31:14.614
Yeah. That or ten
years, I think?

31:15.646 --> 31:16.880
It was a full moon, that's why.

31:16.882 --> 31:18.582
And Mercury's in retrograde.

31:18.584 --> 31:20.486
I thought that only
affected phones?

31:22.654 --> 31:26.490
Yeah. Well, I suppose we
should let you get back to it?

31:26.492 --> 31:27.492
Yeah.

31:28.260 --> 31:29.291
Let me know if you
need anything, mate.

31:29.293 --> 31:30.559
Will do, thanks.

31:30.561 --> 31:31.731
You look great.

31:36.734 --> 31:37.867
It doesn't look that bad.

31:37.869 --> 31:39.769
Not according to Mikaela.

31:39.771 --> 31:42.313
Oh my god, that girl
wouldn't know tact if it

31:42.323 --> 31:44.874
punched her in the face
- sorry, too soon.

31:44.876 --> 31:47.611
- Oh my god.
- Foot in mouth.

31:47.613 --> 31:49.348
So are you going to
show me your stitches?

31:51.349 --> 31:52.684
Oh my God, that's disgusting.

31:55.887 --> 31:58.424
Hey, um, I'm sorry.

31:58.723 --> 32:00.324
Jack...

32:00.326 --> 32:03.425
If I just made you get in the cab with
me, none of this would have happened.

32:03.427 --> 32:04.696
Stop. It was my choice.

32:07.499 --> 32:08.699
You scared the shit out of me.

32:09.835 --> 32:10.870
Yeah, you and me, both.

32:12.171 --> 32:13.706
Fucking scumbag.

32:19.444 --> 32:24.647
Bonnie, I can't believe it. I'm
so sorry that happened to you.

32:24.649 --> 32:26.348
How are you feeling?

32:26.350 --> 32:28.919
It actually looks way
worse than it is.

32:28.921 --> 32:31.755
Mmm you poor thing. Anyway,
just so you know, I've

32:31.757 --> 32:33.490
freed up Guy's calendar so
he can help you out on the.

32:33.492 --> 32:34.223
Speakeasy job.

32:34.225 --> 32:36.292
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

32:36.294 --> 32:39.286
No, he already started on it yesterday.
And I moved

32:39.296 --> 32:42.298
all of your client presentations
to next week, too.

32:42.300 --> 32:43.767
Oh, I should be fine for Friday.

32:43.769 --> 32:46.769
I just, I - I thought it
might be for the best.

32:46.771 --> 32:47.771
Right. Of course.

32:49.340 --> 32:50.906
Wouldn't want anyone to think we're slave
drivers around here, now, would we?

32:50.908 --> 32:51.908
No.

32:53.712 --> 32:57.106
Alright. Well, you just
take your time settling

32:57.116 --> 33:00.520
back in, ok? And just ask
Guy where he got to.

34:19.597 --> 34:23.400
Hey! Como estas?

34:23.935 --> 34:25.333
You're cooking?

34:25.335 --> 34:31.841
Yeah, I thought I'd take a shot
at poisoning us for the evening.

34:31.842 --> 34:34.409
And you've got multiple
processes going!

34:34.411 --> 34:38.580
If you're gonna do something, might
as well go all the way, right?

34:38.581 --> 34:39.581
Yeah.

34:45.022 --> 34:50.359
I should, like, write a blog about this
or do an infomercial or something.

34:50.360 --> 34:52.328
Oh yeah?

34:52.330 --> 34:55.455
Yeah! "Do you want your
man to cook for you?

34:55.465 --> 34:58.600
Clean? Pick up his dirty
laundry off the floor?"

34:58.602 --> 35:01.973
"Well it's easy!
Step 1: Get raped."

35:10.816 --> 35:12.385
Whoa, tough room.

35:16.655 --> 35:19.656
Ok, well - I'm gonna
go take a shower.

35:19.658 --> 35:20.660
Ok.

36:18.082 --> 36:19.082
I'm sorry.

36:20.952 --> 36:21.952
It's okay.

36:22.086 --> 36:23.086
Is it?

36:30.961 --> 36:32.162
You know, I'm really trying...

36:32.164 --> 36:35.564
I know, I know. It's
just, like, a lot.

36:35.566 --> 36:40.870
Well, isn't this what I'm supposed to do?
Take care of you?

36:40.872 --> 36:43.439
You never wanted to do
that for me before?

36:43.441 --> 36:45.140
Well, you didn't need it.

36:45.142 --> 36:46.544
Didn't I?

36:52.450 --> 36:55.987
It's just - It's just
- It's sad.

36:58.055 --> 37:00.723
Well, yeah, of course, I mean
- it's going to be tough -

37:00.725 --> 37:04.201
No, I mean, that it
took this to get you to

37:04.211 --> 37:07.696
make me something that
isn't out of a can.

37:07.698 --> 37:10.033
Ok, I know that it
- seems bad but -

37:10.035 --> 37:11.000
Yeah, that's because it is.

37:11.002 --> 37:12.505
Well, I can't change the past.

37:13.805 --> 37:18.808
Look, I'm sorry, you're
right, it's - it's shitty.

37:18.810 --> 37:21.719
It shouldn't have taken this
for me to get my act together,

37:21.729 --> 37:24.647
but would you rather that
I just don't try at all?

37:24.649 --> 37:28.639
No, that's not what I'm -
I'm just saying that it's,

37:28.649 --> 37:32.649
like, all this effort all
at once - it's like, ugh.

37:32.756 --> 37:35.427
I just want - I just
want the old Matt back.

37:38.597 --> 37:40.830
I don't know if I can
just snap back to that.

37:40.832 --> 37:45.133
Well can you just, please try?
Just for a little while,

37:45.135 --> 37:46.135
just try.

37:48.173 --> 37:49.475
Please?

37:53.812 --> 37:55.078
Yum.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.046
I saw the, um - pamphlets from
the hospital in the recycling.

37:57.048 --> 37:58.513
Oh my god.

37:58.515 --> 38:01.783
I just - don't you think that some
kind of therapy might be helpful?

38:01.785 --> 38:05.020
Oh my god, ok - So because you
can't "fix me" with breakfast in

38:05.022 --> 38:07.256
bed or whatever this is, I
have to go see a therapist?

38:07.258 --> 38:07.823
No, I can't fix - I
can't fix anything!

38:07.825 --> 38:09.692
I'm not asking you to!

38:09.694 --> 38:11.953
Well, you kind of are,
because if you don't tell

38:11.963 --> 38:14.232
anybody else, then you're
putting it all on me.

38:16.935 --> 38:18.968
Fine. I'll stop talking
to you about it then.

38:18.970 --> 38:21.506
Fuck, no, that's not I'm not...

38:23.240 --> 38:29.078
Look, it's... I don't expect
you to get better right away.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.178
Oh my God. "Get better?"

38:30.180 --> 38:35.017
You know what I mean. You've
been through, like...

38:35.019 --> 38:37.185
If this happened to anybody,
they'd need help getting -

38:37.187 --> 38:38.053
Well, I'm not anybody!

38:38.055 --> 38:41.092
Yeah, I've - I... I know.

38:42.660 --> 38:43.896
I know you're not.

38:48.098 --> 38:50.836
If I go to therapy, it's like...

38:56.006 --> 38:59.778
It's like he's - It's
like he's all the way in.

39:03.847 --> 39:07.917
Well maybe you could, just,
talk to Jack or your parents -

39:07.919 --> 39:09.651
I told you -

39:09.653 --> 39:11.728
Well, I don't think that he's gonna
- I don't

39:11.738 --> 39:13.823
think that they're
going to freak out -

39:13.825 --> 39:16.359
Ok. Alright. They are not - They
are not like your parents, ok?

39:16.361 --> 39:18.294
They're not.

39:18.296 --> 39:22.106
My mom is still mad that
we moved in together.

39:22.116 --> 39:25.935
She'll probably say this
was God's punishment.

39:25.937 --> 39:27.640
So, just trust me on that, ok?

39:45.289 --> 39:47.625
Ok, I will try to go
to a support group.

39:49.727 --> 39:50.727
Really?

39:51.963 --> 39:54.964
Yes, but you have to promise me
that you're not going to ask me

39:54.966 --> 39:57.767
about - talking to my
parents about this again.

39:57.769 --> 40:00.973
Nope. Ok.

40:07.946 --> 40:11.714
Your bartering skills
are very impressive.

40:11.716 --> 40:15.817
Thank you. Much more than I can
say for your cooking skills.

40:15.819 --> 40:16.986
This is bad, isn't it?

40:16.988 --> 40:18.087
What's this little guy?

40:18.089 --> 40:19.055
That's a carrot!

40:19.057 --> 40:21.126
Ok, wow.

40:22.727 --> 40:25.030
Why did you add
anchovies to this?

40:27.765 --> 40:30.133
I really thought I had
a chance at Top Chef.

40:30.135 --> 40:33.669
Oh, that's so sweet.

40:33.671 --> 40:37.272
Should I just call Thai Palace? Should I
just - We don't have to eat it right?

40:37.274 --> 40:41.743
No, call Thai Palace, please.
It was very nice.

40:41.745 --> 40:42.211
Thank you.

40:42.213 --> 40:43.213
Mm-hmm.

40:45.783 --> 40:48.052
But this Pad That's
gonna be better.

41:52.216 --> 41:54.750
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.

41:54.752 --> 41:57.453
No, it's quite alright,
please come join us.

41:57.455 --> 42:01.760
Um. We're just getting started, so...
have a seat if you like.

42:08.232 --> 42:09.799
Welcome. I'm Ariel.

42:09.801 --> 42:11.234
Hi. I'm Bonnie.

42:11.236 --> 42:12.271
Hi.

42:14.305 --> 42:17.242
Um, would anyone
care to share next?

42:19.077 --> 42:20.779
Go ahead, Joanna.

42:22.781 --> 42:25.284
Hi, I'm Joanna.

42:27.218 --> 42:32.357
Um... My ex-husband keeps
showing up lately.

42:34.959 --> 42:38.453
I try to stand my ground
but, he always finds a

42:38.463 --> 42:41.966
way to talk me into letting
him inside the house.

42:46.870 --> 42:50.196
I don't understand how
I can be so confident

42:50.206 --> 42:53.542
in other areas of my
life, but with him

42:53.544 --> 42:54.747
I feel like nothing.

42:58.482 --> 43:01.917
I don't want to tell the
kids what he's done.

43:01.919 --> 43:04.490
I still want them to
know their father.

43:06.191 --> 43:09.194
They should, shouldn't they? That...
that's their right.

43:12.830 --> 43:15.834
But he still - he scares me.

43:18.368 --> 43:22.374
I think he'd even hurt the
kids just to get at me.

44:01.011 --> 44:02.011
You okay?

44:02.513 --> 44:04.145
Fuck - Matt!

44:04.147 --> 44:04.979
Woah, sorry!

44:04.981 --> 44:06.350
What are you doing
home so early?

44:10.521 --> 44:11.990
How was it?

44:17.227 --> 44:19.263
I'm not going to one of
those things ever again.

44:20.964 --> 44:23.165
Look, maybe it just takes
some time, you know? It...

44:23.167 --> 44:26.269
Don't school me on this, ok?
I acquiesced, I tried and it

44:26.271 --> 44:29.004
made me feel like utter
shit - so can we drop it?

44:29.006 --> 44:30.006
Ok?

44:43.153 --> 44:44.153
Ow! F...

44:59.169 --> 45:01.337
Mi hija. I haven't
heard from you in

45:01.339 --> 45:04.540
forever... [Spanish] You're
probably working too hard,

45:04.542 --> 45:05.542
as usual.

45:06.810 --> 45:11.379
Ahora, listen to me, your Papi wants
to see you. Give him a call, okay?

45:11.381 --> 45:15.051
And we need to talk about the 4th of
July, okay? Your brothers are coming.

45:15.053 --> 45:18.154
[Spanish] If you want I suppose
you can bring Matthew, if he

45:18.156 --> 45:19.358
doesn't have any plans.

45:21.258 --> 45:24.326
Bonnie, um... Hi, this is
Detective Lambert from the NYPD.

45:24.328 --> 45:27.263
I'm calling to let you know
there was another assault

45:27.265 --> 45:30.533
in your area last night and the
man was caught leaving the

45:30.535 --> 45:32.067
scene. So we are hopeful that it

45:32.069 --> 45:33.336
is the same man

45:33.338 --> 45:37.006
that attacked you last week. So
we need you to come into the

45:37.008 --> 45:41.209
precinct tomorrow, to see if you
can identify him in a lineup.

45:41.211 --> 45:44.615
You'll be safe, he won't see you.
Ah, it shouldn't take more than -

46:06.671 --> 46:09.138
We should leave in 30 minutes.

46:09.140 --> 46:11.143
Yep, I'm just looking
up directions.

46:15.078 --> 46:20.649
I think if we take the J we can...
the J will take us straight there.

46:20.651 --> 46:23.488
Yep. Yep, that's right.

47:08.598 --> 47:09.598
Hey.

47:10.133 --> 47:11.133
I couldn't I.D. him.

47:11.602 --> 47:13.435
What does that mean?

47:13.437 --> 47:15.745
I stared at these six
guys right in the face,

47:15.755 --> 47:18.073
and and I didn't know
which one it was.

47:18.075 --> 47:20.609
No, I mean - so, so now what?

47:20.611 --> 47:22.444
I'm so fucking
annoyed with myself.

47:22.446 --> 47:24.212
I should have just
looked at him.

47:24.214 --> 47:26.649
I just thought if I saw him again...
it would just

47:26.651 --> 47:27.616
come back or...

47:27.618 --> 47:30.618
Hey, it was dark, you were scared.
It's okay.

47:30.620 --> 47:35.424
It's not okay. It's stupid, that's
what it is. Really fucking stupid.

47:35.426 --> 47:36.426
Hey!

47:39.830 --> 47:42.098
Are you the other girl?

47:42.100 --> 47:43.100
Sorry?

47:43.702 --> 47:46.171
I'm so sorry you had
to go through that.

47:54.278 --> 47:58.314
I'm sorry... no... I... I don't
know what you're talking about.

47:58.316 --> 47:59.316
What?

48:00.385 --> 48:03.451
I'm sorry about whatever
happened to you but I'm not -

48:03.453 --> 48:04.589
Where'd you get that then?

48:10.127 --> 48:12.229
Sorry. She's upset, you know?

48:18.368 --> 48:20.669
Bonnie, whoa, okay...
Bonnie, slow down.

48:20.671 --> 48:22.872
I don't want to be a part of
this sisterhood of rape victims.

48:22.874 --> 48:24.374
Ok, I get it.

48:24.376 --> 48:28.343
I'm not like that girl. That girl's
a fucking mess! I'm not like that.

48:28.345 --> 48:29.812
Hey, she was just upset -

48:29.814 --> 48:33.348
So am I, but I'm not going to make
a big scene in front of everybody.

48:33.350 --> 48:37.520
Every? Who's everybody? Look, she
was just trying to comfort you.

48:37.522 --> 48:38.455
More like comfort herself.

48:38.457 --> 48:41.624
Ok. Is that such a...
such a bad thing?

48:41.626 --> 48:46.395
Do you hear yourself? Ok, so we were
raped by the same asshole of a guy?

48:46.397 --> 48:49.798
Yeah, okay, so now we have some sacred bond
and we're supposed to heal each other?

48:49.800 --> 48:51.066
I don't know. Would you
say the same thing

48:51.068 --> 48:53.569
about cancer patients who go to
support groups, stuff like that?

48:53.571 --> 48:54.803
I'm not dying, Matt!

48:54.805 --> 48:57.238
I know you're... come on, I...

48:57.240 --> 48:58.841
It's not... It's a
stupid argument.

48:58.843 --> 49:00.642
It's not even in
the same universe.

49:00.644 --> 49:02.745
I just don't think
that crying about it

49:02.747 --> 49:05.915
and then rehashing it over and over
again, is going to help anyone.

49:05.917 --> 49:07.319
You don't know that.

50:44.682 --> 50:45.682
Are you sure?

52:12.669 --> 52:13.704
Are you using a condom?

52:15.071 --> 52:18.707
I... Yea... The doctor said I...

52:18.709 --> 52:20.444
Oh, right. Yeah.

52:21.946 --> 52:23.912
Yeah? I mean,
better safe, right?

52:23.914 --> 52:24.914
Right

52:42.700 --> 52:43.702
(laughs) Sorry!

52:44.702 --> 52:45.702
Okay.

52:57.981 --> 52:58.980
It's ok?

52:58.982 --> 53:00.182
- Mhm.
- You sure?

53:00.184 --> 53:02.850
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

53:02.852 --> 53:03.852
Okay.

53:24.140 --> 53:25.676
Come on, baby, fuck me.

53:32.982 --> 53:33.982
Come on baby.

53:37.854 --> 53:40.824
Come on, Matt! Fuck me for real.

53:45.463 --> 53:46.463
Ok.

53:57.006 --> 53:58.073
Just give me a second,
just give me a second.

53:58.075 --> 53:59.075
Ok.

54:00.944 --> 54:02.044
Sorry, I - - It's ok.

54:02.046 --> 54:03.145
Yeah. I dunno.

54:03.147 --> 54:06.551
It's fine. I was tired anyway.

54:48.091 --> 54:49.760
I'm going to start squatting.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.060
You mean like a
30-day challenge?

54:52.062 --> 54:53.962
No, squatting in
vacant apartments.

54:53.964 --> 54:56.932
I swear to God, it's almost
impossible to find an

54:56.934 --> 54:58.200
apartment...

54:58.202 --> 55:00.301
an affordable apartment in New
York City and I just read this

55:00.303 --> 55:02.970
article about all these
internationals that are like

55:02.972 --> 55:05.380
buying up vacant apartments
in Manhattan and

55:05.390 --> 55:07.808
leaving them empty for
years and years until

55:07.810 --> 55:11.145
little Johnny comes along and
claims his piece of the pie.

55:11.147 --> 55:13.281
Ew!

55:13.283 --> 55:15.441
Yeah, it should be illegal
to take up space in

55:15.451 --> 55:17.618
Manhattan. I swear to God, I'm
going to start squatting.

55:17.620 --> 55:20.055
I'm going to be the best damn
squatter New York City has ever seen.

55:20.057 --> 55:24.660
Mm, ok, yes. But you think it's illegal
when your Uber rating drops below 5 stars?

55:24.662 --> 55:28.964
Ok, that is actually a crime. And
this is for the good of America.

55:28.966 --> 55:31.232
Mhm. I don't think that argument
is going to fly in court.

55:31.234 --> 55:32.767
Yeah. You're probably right.

55:32.769 --> 55:34.303
I just have to get
out of my apartment.

55:34.305 --> 55:37.238
There's too many good memories.
I guess they're not

55:37.240 --> 55:38.640
good anymore.

55:38.642 --> 55:39.908
Are you ok?

55:39.910 --> 55:40.910
Huh?

55:40.977 --> 55:41.977
You're like acting weird.

55:42.912 --> 55:47.915
Oh... I'm just... I'm
worried about Matt.

55:47.917 --> 55:49.116
Why?

55:49.118 --> 55:53.321
I dunno, he's just not handling
all of this very well.

55:53.323 --> 55:55.256
Define "handling it well."

55:55.258 --> 55:58.259
He's become so over- protective.
It's like...

55:58.261 --> 56:00.861
- Suffocating?
- Yes! Exactly!

56:00.863 --> 56:03.765
Yeah, but that's normal, right? I feel like
I've become more protective of you, too.

56:03.767 --> 56:05.834
Yeah, but you're not
overbearing about it.

56:05.836 --> 56:07.935
He is literally doing
all the right things.

56:07.937 --> 56:09.039
Check, check, check.

56:11.274 --> 56:13.741
I know, I know. It's a stupid
thing to complain about.

56:13.743 --> 56:17.078
Yeah, yeah, a little bit.
But, I'm sure he understands.

56:17.080 --> 56:20.182
Oh no, no - he understands. Oh,
he understands everything.

56:20.184 --> 56:23.118
He understands everything.
I could spit in his face

56:23.120 --> 56:27.990
and he'd just wipe it off and then rub my
back and say "it's okay, babe. It's ok..."

56:27.992 --> 56:28.991
Bonnie!

56:28.993 --> 56:31.727
I know, I know! I'm a
horrible human being.

56:31.729 --> 56:34.997
I'm a garbage human being.
And I say, I say the

56:34.999 --> 56:36.198
most awful stuff

56:36.200 --> 56:37.899
to him. And I feel
it rising up in my

56:37.901 --> 56:40.334
throat and I'm trying to like
choke it down but I can't.

56:40.336 --> 56:42.069
It's just too... I
can't handle it.

56:42.071 --> 56:44.406
That is so weird... I would have
thought that you'd want him to

56:44.408 --> 56:45.973
be closer after what happened?

56:45.975 --> 56:49.044
Well, I dunno. Maybe I'm
the exception to the rule.

56:49.046 --> 56:52.555
(chuckles) Shocking. Ok,
maybe I'm not allowed to

56:52.565 --> 56:56.084
say this, but - can you
imagine how he must feel?

56:56.086 --> 56:59.720
The fact he didn't come out with us that
night. The guilt must be killing him.

56:59.722 --> 57:04.091
Why do people do that? It's not like I'm
holding it against him or something.

57:04.093 --> 57:06.861
Hmmm... Maybe just,
like, a little bit?

57:06.863 --> 57:07.863
No.

57:08.899 --> 57:11.966
Ok, if that's what you want
me to believe, that's fine.

57:11.968 --> 57:14.336
But, you know... Inner
demons are always the

57:14.338 --> 57:15.772
hardest to overcome.

57:17.207 --> 57:18.327
Did you read that in a book?

57:19.676 --> 57:20.676
I saw it on OWN.

57:21.377 --> 57:23.678
OWN? You're watching OWN now?

57:23.680 --> 57:24.479
The Oprah Winfrey Network.

57:24.481 --> 57:26.247
The Oprah Winfrey... Okay. Okay.

57:26.249 --> 57:27.749
Yes. Hashtag Grateful.

57:27.751 --> 57:28.250
No. No!

57:28.252 --> 57:29.253
Alright.

57:57.046 --> 57:58.314
Excuse me. Sorry.

58:02.185 --> 58:03.787
Sorry. The train was late.

58:19.435 --> 58:21.470
Are you still working
those long hours?

58:21.472 --> 58:22.472
Yea.

58:24.073 --> 58:25.473
You'll make yourself sick.

58:25.475 --> 58:28.178
I'm the lead on a big job.
I have to impress them.

58:36.419 --> 58:38.754
Do you really think
I don't know?

58:38.756 --> 58:42.823
Your friends are writing about
it all over your Facebook.

58:42.825 --> 58:44.058
I thought you didn't know
how to use Facebook?

58:44.060 --> 58:45.160
Your cousin taught me.

58:45.162 --> 58:45.926
Great.

58:45.928 --> 58:47.798
- So?
- So?

58:47.997 --> 58:50.866
So do you think this is how I deserve
to find out something like this?

58:50.868 --> 58:52.868
Mom, I cannot control what
people put on Facebook.

58:52.870 --> 58:55.328
And you've forgotten how
to use the phone, Bonita?

58:55.338 --> 58:57.805
Especially, with your
father the way he is -

58:57.807 --> 58:58.741
Did you tell him?

58:58.743 --> 59:01.008
No. Never. He's in
enough pain without

59:01.010 --> 59:04.111
having to worry about his
daughter running around in the

59:04.113 --> 59:05.379
middle of the night.

59:05.381 --> 59:07.883
Mom, please. It's fine, I'm fine.
Everything

59:07.885 --> 59:09.484
is fine. These things happen.

59:09.486 --> 59:12.187
It's that neighborhood - I
told you, it's not safe.

59:12.189 --> 59:14.355
It's New York City.
Nowhere is safe.

59:14.357 --> 59:16.390
Then you should be extra careful.
Not running around

59:16.392 --> 59:19.093
- sola por la noche!
- Por favor!

59:19.095 --> 59:22.204
I know Matthew was not there with you.
What kind

59:22.214 --> 59:25.332
of friends let you go
out sola por la noche?

59:25.334 --> 59:26.801
You need to move.

59:26.803 --> 59:29.937
To Queens? You just told me last
month your neighbors got robbed.

59:29.939 --> 59:35.410
That's different. My own daughter
can't even find the time to call me.

59:35.412 --> 59:39.346
I just didn't want to worry you. Okay,
you have enough on your plate as it is.

59:39.348 --> 59:43.321
Do you ever think tha it worries me
more when I don't hear from you?

59:45.354 --> 59:47.357
Did you cancel
your credit cards?

59:48.357 --> 59:50.357
Uh, yeah. Yeah I did.

59:50.359 --> 59:52.493
Brooklyn is where all of
the drug dealers live.

59:52.495 --> 59:55.296
My God. Mom, it's not the 80s!

59:55.298 --> 59:59.533
Listen to me. You tell
me next time, you hear?

59:59.535 --> 01:00:04.075
Not the stupid computer. You
call me and you tell me.

01:00:24.394 --> 01:00:26.328
Hey. Bonnie, right?

01:00:26.330 --> 01:00:27.365
Yeah, Bonnie Gonzalez.

01:00:28.865 --> 01:00:31.933
You got my number from Vernon? At
the station? Ah - what's his name.

01:00:31.935 --> 01:00:33.234
Oh, ah... Detective Lambert?

01:00:33.236 --> 01:00:39.441
Right. Right! He's a good guy. I
know he can be a bit abrasive

01:00:39.443 --> 01:00:42.936
[laughs] at first... He's
gotta work on his people

01:00:42.946 --> 01:00:46.448
skills but I keep telling him that.
Vernon! "Come on!"

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.183
You know, today already.
You want some water?

01:00:49.185 --> 01:00:52.455
I'm hopeless that way. Here,
let me get you some water.

01:00:56.459 --> 01:00:57.459
Thank you

01:00:58.261 --> 01:01:00.895
I'm, I'm Kirra, by the way.
Kirra Williams.

01:01:00.897 --> 01:01:02.566
Nice to meet you.

01:01:04.635 --> 01:01:07.960
So, I had a chance to look
over your file quickly and

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:11.305
we got to decide what angle
to take here, honey.

01:01:11.307 --> 01:01:13.308
You're a smart girl, right?
You went to college?

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:14.575
Yeah, I went to Syracuse.

01:01:14.577 --> 01:01:16.278
That's great! The
judge will love that.

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.046
And you're pretty,
that - that helps too.

01:01:18.048 --> 01:01:20.482
I mean, obviously, you were just
born that way, but trust me,

01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:22.350
it's good for our case.

01:01:22.352 --> 01:01:23.352
Oh.

01:01:29.693 --> 01:01:34.194
So, we are just waiting on the
results of your rape kit?

01:01:34.196 --> 01:01:36.131
Um, yeah. I believe so.

01:01:36.133 --> 01:01:39.842
Ok, that way we can see
if the DNA matches the

01:01:39.852 --> 01:01:43.571
guy who raped the other girl, right?
Ok. Good.

01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:47.015
Well, hopefully we'll
have two matching sets of

01:01:47.025 --> 01:01:50.477
DNA. We'll put this guy
away for a long time.

01:01:50.479 --> 01:01:55.183
Um, what if the DNA isn't a match
and it was some other guy.

01:01:55.185 --> 01:01:59.156
Well, that's gonna
be a harder battle.

01:02:01.490 --> 01:02:04.382
Hopefully we can still
find him - but if he's

01:02:04.392 --> 01:02:07.294
a first time offender,
that could be tough.

01:02:07.296 --> 01:02:09.196
Wait, even with the DNA?

01:02:09.198 --> 01:02:11.031
He'll argue it was consensual.

01:02:11.033 --> 01:02:12.633
He practically broke
my cheekbone.

01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:19.406
That's neither here nor there. Plus,
you were intoxicated. And, uh,

01:02:19.408 --> 01:02:20.528
you can't remember anything.

01:02:21.410 --> 01:02:25.513
I can remember some things.
Very clearly.

01:02:25.515 --> 01:02:28.450
The problem is is that he'll
remember everything, perfectly

01:02:28.452 --> 01:02:30.417
clearly. You know,
he's going to say you

01:02:30.419 --> 01:02:32.520
came onto him, that
you were flirting

01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:34.522
and dancing with him
all night at the bar.

01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:37.125
That it was your idea. And
you blatantly asked him t

01:02:37.127 --> 01:02:37.959
have sex with you.

01:02:37.961 --> 01:02:40.028
I would never in a
million years...

01:02:40.030 --> 01:02:44.399
Yeah, but you can't remember?
And just to help him even more,

01:02:44.401 --> 01:02:48.002
he has your toxicology
report at this point.

01:02:48.004 --> 01:02:50.604
I am not the one who is
supposed on trial here.

01:02:50.606 --> 01:02:53.310
But to the defense, you are.

01:02:55.778 --> 01:02:56.981
What district are you in?

01:02:58.448 --> 01:03:00.647
Bushwick.

01:03:00.649 --> 01:03:04.443
Great, you'll probably going
to get Mahoney - he is a

01:03:04.453 --> 01:03:08.256
downright creep and has
made it his mission in life

01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:09.591
to get every rapist
off the hook.

01:03:09.593 --> 01:03:13.194
God knows why, ah... his mother
didn't hug him enough as a kid,

01:03:13.196 --> 01:03:14.196
who knows...

01:03:16.133 --> 01:03:18.566
but he'll break you down and
you need to be prepared.

01:03:18.568 --> 01:03:21.403
His aim is to get the judge to
question your character and

01:03:21.405 --> 01:03:22.605
lighten this creep's sentence.

01:03:24.673 --> 01:03:27.999
Of course, I'll "object"
every time, but he'll

01:03:28.009 --> 01:03:31.345
plant the seed. Now
don't get me wrong,

01:03:31.347 --> 01:03:34.456
I agree with you. All
that shit doesn't matter.

01:03:34.466 --> 01:03:37.584
Rape is rape. That's all
it should come down to.

01:03:37.586 --> 01:03:40.687
But we're not saving the world
today, we're not single-handedly

01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:43.591
changing the criminal
justice system - not today.

01:03:43.593 --> 01:03:48.595
Our aim is to put this guy behind
bars for as long as possible.

01:03:48.597 --> 01:03:53.468
And then he'll just get out and do
it again, right? What is the point?

01:03:53.470 --> 01:03:56.370
Well, I figure, it's better than
sitting around here and doing

01:03:56.372 --> 01:03:58.540
nothin' all day. And he'll
get out, he'll do it

01:03:58.542 --> 01:03:59.822
again - they always do it again.

01:04:01.211 --> 01:04:05.149
And then - then we'll put
him behind bars for life.

01:04:07.484 --> 01:04:12.620
And honey, if you were Black
or he was your husband?

01:04:12.622 --> 01:04:19.263
Don't even think about it.
You're one of my easy cases.

01:05:05.475 --> 01:05:09.209
Oh, do you want to -
do you want to go?

01:05:09.211 --> 01:05:09.877
You can go. You can go.

01:05:09.879 --> 01:05:16.584
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:05:16.586 --> 01:05:18.589
- It's ok? Yeah?
- Aha. Yeah.

01:07:18.274 --> 01:07:23.678
Did you think about it?
What happened to me?

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:26.314
Hey... Let's just...

01:07:26.316 --> 01:07:27.350
I want to know.

01:07:30.886 --> 01:07:37.825
I did. I didn't
want to, but I did.

01:07:37.827 --> 01:07:41.232
I'm sure that's
completely normal.

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:44.734
Did you?

01:07:51.841 --> 01:07:52.973
This feels like a trap.

01:07:52.975 --> 01:07:54.841
It's not. I promise.

01:07:54.843 --> 01:07:59.383
Yes. I thought about it, ok? And I
fucking hate that I thought about it.

01:08:09.725 --> 01:08:11.392
Did the thought of
it turn you on?

01:08:11.394 --> 01:08:15.863
- Bonnie. Come on.
- It's ok if it did.

01:08:15.865 --> 01:08:17.756
The thought of that fucking
piece of shit doing

01:08:17.767 --> 01:08:19.669
that to you? No, that
doesn't turn me on.

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:35.417
Does it turn you on?

01:08:40.356 --> 01:08:46.562
Well, I just couldn't stop
thinking about it. So...

01:08:50.033 --> 01:08:52.770
I just changed his
face to your face.

01:08:55.770 --> 01:09:00.042
Ok, yeah. Yeah, that's...
That's fine.

01:09:05.613 --> 01:09:07.582
Do you look at me
differently now?

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:10.484
- No.
- You must.

01:09:10.486 --> 01:09:17.625
If you mean, do I love you any less?
No. If anything, I love you more.

01:09:17.627 --> 01:09:18.629
Out of pity.

01:09:24.633 --> 01:09:25.867
Do I still turn you on?

01:09:25.868 --> 01:09:28.469
Babe. Baby, we just had sex!

01:09:28.470 --> 01:09:29.804
I know, but was it as good?

01:09:29.805 --> 01:09:32.974
Was it - was it... I don't even
know what you want me to say.

01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:34.608
So that's a no.

01:09:34.609 --> 01:09:37.613
It was good. It was good, baby?

01:09:39.615 --> 01:09:43.618
Can we please just, like,
try to enjoy this moment?

01:09:47.055 --> 01:09:52.729
I want to just enjoy this, you know?
Te amo.

01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:56.633
I love you, too.

01:10:37.806 --> 01:10:42.812
Bonnie. Bonnie? Can we have a
chat in the conference room?

01:10:54.923 --> 01:10:59.926
Bonnie, we love your work
here, you know that.

01:10:59.928 --> 01:11:02.996
Um... And, I know you're going
through a tough time right now,

01:11:02.998 --> 01:11:06.901
and I want you to know that we've
got your back, 100 percent.

01:11:06.903 --> 01:11:10.505
But we've decided it's just not
working having you as the lead

01:11:10.507 --> 01:11:12.740
on The Speakeasy job.
It's just, it's such

01:11:12.742 --> 01:11:13.640
a big account.

01:11:13.642 --> 01:11:16.010
You know, we can't
have a misstep here.

01:11:16.012 --> 01:11:19.279
I'm sure you understand that?
But, we'll put you on one of

01:11:19.281 --> 01:11:20.480
the smaller jobs.

01:11:20.482 --> 01:11:26.987
Maybe, maybe the Martha's Vineyard Shop?
[muffled]

01:11:26.989 --> 01:11:29.059
Great. Ok.

01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:47.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey
girl, hold your horses.

01:11:47.877 --> 01:11:50.611
Oh my God, that last one
went right to my head.

01:11:50.613 --> 01:11:51.653
And the three before that?

01:11:52.548 --> 01:11:54.782
Ok, so I might see you
kids over the weekend?

01:11:54.784 --> 01:11:55.950
I'll walk home with you.

01:11:55.952 --> 01:11:57.151
Why? Where are you going?

01:11:57.153 --> 01:11:59.886
I dunno, I just want to go for a walk.
It's a nice night.

01:11:59.888 --> 01:12:00.888
Yeah, I'll go too.

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:02.255
- Let's all go!
- C'mon!

01:12:02.257 --> 01:12:04.325
Since when do we walk
each other home?

01:12:04.327 --> 01:12:07.795
I was thinking about it and I feel like
we should make it a habit from now on.

01:12:07.797 --> 01:12:08.797
Really?

01:12:08.998 --> 01:12:09.964
Yeah, we can all take turns.

01:12:09.966 --> 01:12:12.633
And I'll go last, cause
I'm the manliest.

01:12:12.635 --> 01:12:13.768
Okay. Guys, come on.

01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:14.770
What?

01:12:16.405 --> 01:12:19.139
Are you going to be there every single time
I have to be walked home late at night?

01:12:19.141 --> 01:12:22.242
No, but we're here now. So...

01:12:22.244 --> 01:12:26.714
Look. It's very nice and all,
but you can just go on home.

01:12:26.716 --> 01:12:28.049
Then I'm paying for you cab.

01:12:28.051 --> 01:12:30.818
Pree! You were just saying 20
minutes ago that you're broke.

01:12:30.820 --> 01:12:31.818
Then I'll pay for it.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.888
It's a 10 minute walk!

01:12:33.890 --> 01:12:37.124
So, what's the big deal? We just
want to make sure you get home okay.

01:12:37.126 --> 01:12:41.828
It just... It makes me feel some wounded
dog that you guys need to rescue.

01:12:41.830 --> 01:12:43.029
Bonnie, we're just
trying to help.

01:12:43.031 --> 01:12:45.869
Because I'm a walking billboard
that says: "help me"?

01:12:50.772 --> 01:12:51.892
Did Matt put you up to this?

01:12:52.107 --> 01:12:54.242
What? No.

01:12:54.244 --> 01:12:57.936
You are a terrible liar.
Ok, it's not that I don't

01:12:57.946 --> 01:13:01.648
appreciate it or anything,
it's just there's no point.

01:13:01.650 --> 01:13:03.050
It's only been a few weeks.

01:13:03.052 --> 01:13:05.987
Yeah, but I wish everyone
would just get over it!

01:13:05.989 --> 01:13:07.057
The way that you are?

01:13:08.624 --> 01:13:15.763
Matt totally put you guys up to this.
He's the worst offender! I swear.

01:13:15.765 --> 01:13:20.867
Okay, I'm just going to say the thing
that I'm probably not supposed to say

01:13:20.869 --> 01:13:27.207
I'm so sick of the way everyone is looking
at me, and the half-assed shoulder rubs

01:13:27.209 --> 01:13:31.911
and the random box of chocolates
on my desk from some fucking guy

01:13:31.913 --> 01:13:34.113
in accounting who
I don't even...

01:13:34.115 --> 01:13:36.907
I've never even said "hello" to
- I'm sick of it! It

01:13:36.917 --> 01:13:39.719
sucks, ok. What happened
to me, it's shit, but...

01:13:39.721 --> 01:13:41.724
this "pity party" is
just making it worse!

01:13:44.726 --> 01:13:47.863
I didn't... I didn't
mean you guys.

01:13:56.071 --> 01:14:00.077
Ok, you can walk me home.

01:14:15.290 --> 01:14:16.627
Hey.

01:14:17.060 --> 01:14:22.231
Hey. It's 1AM.

01:14:24.066 --> 01:14:27.404
Yeah, no, I was just
about to go to bed.

01:14:30.405 --> 01:14:31.772
How were drinks?

01:14:31.774 --> 01:14:32.774
Good.

01:14:35.477 --> 01:14:36.477
Ok.

01:14:51.994 --> 01:14:53.997
So now I have a neighborhood
watch, just for me?

01:14:58.133 --> 01:15:03.871
You know, I saw you walking home the
other day from work. You were terrified.

01:15:03.873 --> 01:15:06.005
Oh you're spying on me now, too?

01:15:06.007 --> 01:15:07.087
- Oh come on.
- You come on.

01:15:11.314 --> 01:15:12.314
I think we should move.

01:15:15.851 --> 01:15:17.452
I love our apartment.

01:15:17.454 --> 01:15:21.188
Yeah, me too. But I think it's time we get
a fresh start. You know, someplace new.

01:15:21.190 --> 01:15:23.023
You mean run away?

01:15:23.025 --> 01:15:25.700
No. It's not running away, okay.
I think it's

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:28.394
for the best. Even if
it's just temporary.

01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:34.870
I can get over this, okay? I can
walk home without being all weird...

01:15:37.839 --> 01:15:39.305
I just, I don't think
it's that simple.

01:15:39.307 --> 01:15:41.541
I mean... look... you're walking
past the place where it

01:15:41.543 --> 01:15:43.309
happened, every day. I
mean, come on, who could

01:15:43.311 --> 01:15:44.143
cope with that?

01:15:44.145 --> 01:15:46.412
You are the one
that's not coping.

01:15:46.414 --> 01:15:48.515
You're waiting up
at night for me?

01:15:48.517 --> 01:15:51.117
And now you're home
at 6pm on the dot

01:15:51.119 --> 01:15:54.388
every single day. I have
been trying to get you to

01:15:54.390 --> 01:15:58.128
come home early for months,
and this is what it takes?

01:15:58.961 --> 01:16:00.294
It's bullshit.

01:16:00.296 --> 01:16:03.229
Ok, I admit: Maybe I haven't
handled this the best way, but...

01:16:03.231 --> 01:16:06.133
You have made me so aware of
my every single movement.

01:16:06.135 --> 01:16:09.103
And every time you do something
that is so "un-Matt"

01:16:09.105 --> 01:16:12.505
it just reminds me that you look
at me completely differently now.

01:16:12.507 --> 01:16:13.808
- That's not fair.
- It's true.

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:14.375
No it isn't!

01:16:14.377 --> 01:16:15.377
Bullshit.

01:16:16.878 --> 01:16:18.481
Ok, I... What do
you want from me?

01:16:20.016 --> 01:16:22.349
I told you, I just want
everything to go back to the way

01:16:22.351 --> 01:16:24.285
it was before. I don't
understand why that is

01:16:24.287 --> 01:16:25.819
so goddamn hard to understand.

01:16:25.821 --> 01:16:29.825
I, I don't know if it
can be like that again.

01:16:33.829 --> 01:16:36.964
But look, maybe we're meant to
create a new-kind-of-normal.

01:16:36.966 --> 01:16:38.502
Maybe that's how we
get through this?

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:45.171
And maybe, just maybe we end up some
place better than where we started?

01:16:45.173 --> 01:16:47.474
Ok, so maybe I'll just be
thankful that I was raped?

01:16:47.476 --> 01:16:49.475
Fuck. Stop misconstruing
my words.

01:16:49.477 --> 01:16:52.912
How about this, okay? How
about you let me decide how

01:16:52.914 --> 01:16:56.183
I feel and how I feel and
how I want to handle this.

01:16:56.185 --> 01:16:58.888
Your way of handling
it isn't working, Bon.

01:17:00.455 --> 01:17:02.555
Fuck you. It's been four weeks.

01:17:02.557 --> 01:17:05.351
Exactly! It's been four weeks!
That's it. So maybe

01:17:05.361 --> 01:17:08.164
it's not all meant to
snap back in four weeks.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.166
You haven't even told
anybody the truth yet.

01:17:13.168 --> 01:17:15.036
That has nothing to do with it!

01:17:15.038 --> 01:17:17.730
Yes it does! Because it
puts it all on me. And

01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.441
I don't - I don't know
if I can handle it!

01:17:20.443 --> 01:17:21.845
I shouldn't have even told you.

01:17:24.413 --> 01:17:28.385
Really, Bonnie? Like that was
even an option? Jesus Christ.

01:17:35.123 --> 01:17:37.331
Look, it doesn't have to
be these two extremes,

01:17:37.341 --> 01:17:39.559
you know? Maybe we're
supposed to find...

01:17:39.561 --> 01:17:43.496
Oh please, please, stop
with the "we" bullshit.

01:17:43.498 --> 01:17:44.498
This happened to us.

01:17:47.436 --> 01:17:54.174
You have no... you have,
you really have no idea.

01:17:54.176 --> 01:17:57.510
Alright. I'm just saying
that I lost something too.

01:17:57.512 --> 01:17:59.078
What? Your girlfriend's purity?

01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:00.581
Fucking stop it. I'm not...
You're not going to

01:18:00.583 --> 01:18:02.349
do that to me, okay? You
are not going to make me

01:18:02.351 --> 01:18:03.351
into "that guy."

01:18:04.486 --> 01:18:06.420
I get that you're angry, ok? I
get that you're angry at him.

01:18:06.422 --> 01:18:08.288
You're angry at all men.
Yeah, I'm angry too.

01:18:08.290 --> 01:18:10.090
You don't think I want
to fucking kill that guy

01:18:10.092 --> 01:18:11.157
for what he did?!

01:18:11.159 --> 01:18:12.992
Well, maybe if you had
been there you could have.

01:18:12.994 --> 01:18:15.064
And maybe if you could fucking
stop at three drinks.

01:18:21.537 --> 01:18:25.527
I didn't mean that. I
didn't mean that. Hey,

01:18:25.537 --> 01:18:29.537
c'mon. You know I didn't mean that.
I'm sorry.

01:18:30.413 --> 01:18:33.514
Nothing you did was wrong -
Ok, he's the asshole, I'm the

01:18:33.516 --> 01:18:36.317
fucking asshole. Everything
that you're doing...

01:18:36.319 --> 01:18:39.289
Everything that you've done - it's good.
It's all good.

01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:52.168
I think it too, you know. I
think that all the time.

01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:58.162
If I just hadn't had that
last drink, or maybe if I

01:18:58.172 --> 01:19:01.675
wasn't so cheap and took a
fucking cab home for once

01:19:01.677 --> 01:19:03.680
or if I didn't have
my headphones on...

01:19:08.684 --> 01:19:15.292
And then I think - why? He would have
just done it to somebody else, right?

01:19:18.694 --> 01:19:22.665
And I would not - I would
not wish this on anybody.

01:19:41.016 --> 01:19:43.736
I've been thinking about this a lot...
And I think I should move out.

01:19:46.221 --> 01:19:47.221
Don't.

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:51.090
I don't think this relationship is
working anymore, for either one of us.

01:19:51.092 --> 01:19:52.158
Don't do this.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:53.160
I'm sorry.

01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:06.309
I know you're really
trying, Matt.

01:20:12.181 --> 01:20:17.617
But I just don't. I don't see...
I don't see...

01:20:17.619 --> 01:20:20.622
how we can survive this.

01:21:14.376 --> 01:21:19.645
Bonnie, honey, it's Kirra Williams.
I got some bad news.

01:21:19.647 --> 01:21:22.515
The man they caught - who
attacked the other girl?

01:21:22.517 --> 01:21:27.653
Well, the DNA tests came back and he
wasn't the same man that attacked you.

01:21:27.655 --> 01:21:32.259
I'm sorry, honey. Also, the
swabs they took from you?

01:21:32.261 --> 01:21:38.568
They were inconclusive - the DNA doesn't
match any of our records. I'm sorry-

01:23:59.807 --> 01:24:02.876
Excuse me. Do you realize how
reckless you were just being?

01:24:02.878 --> 01:24:04.111
Excuse me?

01:24:04.113 --> 01:24:06.712
I don't know if you heard, but
two women were just raped

01:24:06.714 --> 01:24:09.316
recently in this area and you're
just walking around with your

01:24:09.318 --> 01:24:11.818
headphones on, not really paying
any attention to the world.

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:12.885
Ok, what the hell?

01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:15.054
Anybody could have been
following you just now.

01:24:15.056 --> 01:24:16.490
Right. Like you just were?

01:24:16.492 --> 01:24:21.361
Yes, exactly. I was like two feet
behind you and you didn't even notice.

01:24:21.363 --> 01:24:23.063
Are you trying to
sell me something?

01:24:23.065 --> 01:24:24.997
I don't want whatever
it is, lady -

01:24:24.999 --> 01:24:29.001
Look, I'm just trying to get you to
be more aware of your surroundings.

01:24:29.003 --> 01:24:30.739
Thank you for the P.S.A.

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:33.040
I'm serious.

01:24:33.508 --> 01:24:35.675
What on earth is your problem?

01:24:35.677 --> 01:24:36.943
I'm not the one with
the problem here.

01:24:36.945 --> 01:24:39.379
Oh trust me, you
have a huge problem.

01:24:39.381 --> 01:24:41.314
Do you realize you are
practically asking for it?

01:24:41.316 --> 01:24:42.250
Who the hell are you?

01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:44.417
Oh my god, take out your
goddamn headphones.

01:24:44.419 --> 01:24:46.652
Get your fucking
hands off of me!

01:24:46.654 --> 01:24:48.354
Look around you. Listen to me.

01:24:48.356 --> 01:24:49.855
The world does not
stop for you, okay?

01:24:49.857 --> 01:24:51.825
It keeps spinning,
no matter what.

01:24:51.827 --> 01:24:54.201
And you think you're safe
because you're right

01:24:54.211 --> 01:24:56.595
outside your building?
You're fucking delusional!

01:24:56.597 --> 01:25:02.035
Lady, I don't know what happened to you.
But it's not my fucking problem.

01:25:02.037 --> 01:25:04.606
Now leave me the fuck alone.

01:25:41.409 --> 01:25:42.409
What up?

01:25:42.644 --> 01:25:48.482
Hey? Hey, hey -

01:25:48.484 --> 01:25:50.887
Hey, come here. Come.

01:26:10.939 --> 01:26:12.642
I don't know what I'm doing.

01:26:15.811 --> 01:26:16.846
It's ok.

01:26:19.815 --> 01:26:21.055
It's going to be ok, I promise.

01:27:03.659 --> 01:27:05.157
I'm sorry, I really
need to get this.

01:27:05.159 --> 01:27:05.858
Yeah, sure.

01:27:05.860 --> 01:27:08.730
No, no - will you please stay?

01:27:11.800 --> 01:27:12.800
Hi, Mom.

01:27:15.604 --> 01:27:18.408
Yeah, no, I've just been really busy
- I'm sorry.

01:27:20.976 --> 01:27:26.645
Mom, can we talk about the holidays a
different time, please? I just can't -

01:27:26.647 --> 01:27:29.785
Mom? Mom.

01:27:31.253 --> 01:27:36.022
Mom - please, stop - ok?
Listen to me, please.

01:27:36.024 --> 01:27:38.794
I need to tell you something.
It's really important.

01:27:41.663 --> 01:27:44.930
No - everything's gonna be fine. It's just
- I just need to tell

01:27:44.932 --> 01:27:47.267
you something and I really
need you to listen.

01:27:47.269 --> 01:27:48.805
Okay? Don't interrupt me.

01:27:52.074 --> 01:27:56.843
I'm sorry... I'm sorry
that I didn't say anything

01:27:56.845 --> 01:27:58.580
about it before.

01:28:02.217 --> 01:28:04.053
But I really need to
tell you something.

01:28:38.954 --> 01:28:42.621
Hey, you were here a
few weeks ago, right?

01:28:42.623 --> 01:28:43.689
Ah, yeah.

01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:44.691
Not coming in?

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:48.594
I was toying with the idea.

01:28:48.596 --> 01:28:51.697
It took me months to come back.
And even then, I thought: "if

01:28:51.699 --> 01:28:55.635
they pull out the crystals
and start burning incense -

01:28:55.637 --> 01:28:59.673
I'm getting outta here". I promise
you, they don't. I'm Mina, by the way.

01:28:59.675 --> 01:29:00.273
Bonnie.

01:29:00.275 --> 01:29:00.740
Nice to meet you.

01:29:00.742 --> 01:29:01.942
Nice to meet you.

01:29:01.944 --> 01:29:05.644
Well. I'm going to go in,
but honestly - no pressure.

01:29:05.646 --> 01:29:06.649
Thanks.
