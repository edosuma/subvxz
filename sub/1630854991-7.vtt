00:00.680 --> 00:01.680
Paula

00:02.720 --> 00:03.999
No comment.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.439
The gardai look at someone like
Nikita

00:05.440 --> 00:07.439
and all they see is weakness and
opportunity.

00:07.440 --> 00:09.799
Nikki's not a fucking rat!

00:09.800 --> 00:12.159
Why did you do it?

00:12.160 --> 00:14.599
Kem, was it you
who pulled the trigger?

00:14.600 --> 00:16.799
No, Viking did.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.839
Want to know a secret?

00:27.840 --> 00:29.999
I don't give a fuck
about any of this.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.959
I want out.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.799
You know, someplace sunny
by a beach

00:33.800 --> 00:35.079
where I can just chill all day.

00:35.080 --> 00:36.239
Yeah.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.199
I don't want you here.
Are you serious?

00:38.200 --> 00:42.559
I'm kicking you out, because I
can't trust you anymore.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.119
You need to keep Anna
far away from him.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.519
Aww.

00:52.520 --> 00:54.239
You alright?
It's Bren.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.719
He's doing it again.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.799
This time it's Anna.

01:53.400 --> 01:55.960
Nuray.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.560
Nuray!

03:08.160 --> 03:10.359
Michael?
Michael, wait!

03:10.360 --> 03:11.999
I fucking said.
Listen to me.

03:12.000 --> 03:16.039
Michael!
Just stop for a minute.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.399
You want to end up back inside?

03:17.400 --> 03:18.599
Well, this is the way
to go about it.

03:18.600 --> 03:19.799
Think I give a fuck about that?

03:19.800 --> 03:20.959
Birdy is right, Michael.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.239
This isn't the way to do it.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.439
He's getting exactly
what he deserves.

03:23.440 --> 03:24.959
Anna is fine.
She's safe.

03:24.960 --> 03:26.839
I dropped her
at her dance class.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.919
Nobody's saying don't do it.

03:27.920 --> 03:28.959
Get the fuck out of my way,
Birdy.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.199
Get out of my way, Birdy.
Not like this. Not like this.

03:30.200 --> 03:31.639
You'll fuck it up
and you'll get caught!

03:31.640 --> 03:33.919
You think I fucking care?! I do.

03:33.920 --> 03:35.399
We'll -- We'll plan it properly.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.919
We'll help you, won't we, Amanda?
Yeah, yeah.

03:36.920 --> 03:39.119
We will get Bren, I promise you.

03:39.120 --> 03:41.119
We'll kill him.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.120
But we'll do it together.

03:45.280 --> 03:46.519
Was two of them, I think.

03:46.520 --> 03:50.239
Fucking dopes.
Amateur hour.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.639
Look, we don't know if they
followed me from here or whatever,

03:52.640 --> 03:53.919
but it was the middle
of the night

03:53.920 --> 03:54.999
and there was no lights
behind me.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.559
Would have seen someone.

03:56.560 --> 03:58.799
I just got out of the car,
and they were there.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.919
He was obviously waiting for me.

04:00.920 --> 04:01.959
And did you get a look at him?

04:01.960 --> 04:03.439
You're joking.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.999
Soon as the gun jammed,
I was fucking gone.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.999
What do you reckon?

04:08.000 --> 04:09.919
Could be anyone.

04:09.920 --> 04:11.919
Probably one
of Ged Delaney's lot.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.559
They're still gunning for blood.

04:17.040 --> 04:18.439
What's the story?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.919
Door opens

04:20.920 --> 04:22.919
You want me to ask around?

04:22.920 --> 04:25.079
See if anybody's heard anything
about what happened last night?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.559
Yeah. Yeah, do that.

04:27.560 --> 04:30.199
Alright.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.479
I'm gonna be relying on you
more and more now, Jimmy.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.839
Yeah, sure.
Anything.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.479
Viking's too hot-headed.

04:37.480 --> 04:39.559
And you're my son,

04:39.560 --> 04:41.400
so I know I can count on you.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.879
Do you want me to wait for you?
No, I'm alright.

04:57.880 --> 04:59.239
Look...

04:59.240 --> 05:02.159
I know you probably
don't want my advice,

05:02.160 --> 05:04.759
but fighting with teenagers
gets you nowhere.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.479
Alright.
Thanks for the lift.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.639
Hey, uh, is Anna inside?

05:19.720 --> 05:21.720
Hey.
Have a word?

05:23.200 --> 05:25.559
Um, I'll see you guys later.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.919
I suppose you're here
to give out to me.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.759
And why would you think that?
I don't know.

05:35.760 --> 05:38.719
Only reason I ever really
see you these days.

05:38.720 --> 05:41.199
Is that necklace new?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.680
Here we go.

05:43.920 --> 05:47.519
Why did you go see him
when I asked you not to?

05:47.520 --> 05:49.279
- Is it 'cause of the money and the presents that he gives you?
- No!

05:49.280 --> 05:51.119
'Cause if you need money,
you come to me.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.279
- I told you it's not about the money.
- I'll give it to you.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.479
Then why?

05:53.480 --> 05:54.999
Why go see him?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.680
Because he's nice to me.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.399
How -- How exactly
is he nice to you?

06:02.400 --> 06:05.159
I really don't know
why this -- It just is.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.439
It's important.

06:06.440 --> 06:09.440
I need to know exactly
how he's nice to you.

06:10.680 --> 06:12.919
He wants me.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.879
He wants me
to be part of his life.

06:14.880 --> 06:16.279
So do I!
No, you don't.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.919
Of course I do.
Of course I do!

06:17.920 --> 06:20.599
You disappear for months at a
time and you don't even call me.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.319
You know why I couldn't
call you. I wanted to.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.519
Except for Anthony, I hardly
know anyone in this family

06:24.520 --> 06:26.359
because you hide me away
like you're ashamed of me.

06:26.360 --> 06:28.439
I am not ashamed of you.
Well, that's how it feels.

06:28.440 --> 06:30.439
Ugh! Granddad
wants me in this family.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.919
He tells me all the time.

06:31.920 --> 06:33.039
I don't fucking care
what he tells you!

06:33.040 --> 06:35.039
You stay away from him.
He is not safe.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.239
Do you understand?

06:36.240 --> 06:38.879
I-I can't talk to you right now.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.959
Where is she?

06:59.960 --> 07:01.800
They're discharging her now.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.679
No charges?

07:04.680 --> 07:07.079
That's a result.
No charges yet.

07:07.080 --> 07:10.119
They're only releasing her while
they prepare a file for the DPP.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.639
Why do you always have to be
so fucking miserable?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.079
Someone has to maintain
a grip on reality.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.159
Yeah, well, I want you keeping
it positive for Nikki today.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.440
Yeah? None of your
fucking gloomy shit.

07:25.160 --> 07:26.599
You took my phone, too.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.679
That's to be held as evidence.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.239
You okay?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.719
Thank you.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.279
I'll let you know
if there's any developments.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.999
They treat you okay in there?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.240
Look, let's just go.

08:04.240 --> 08:06.159
Look, I know you're pissed off.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.239
Just take me home.
Nikki, relax, yeah?

08:09.240 --> 08:12.960
Eric, don't tell me
to fucking relax.

08:15.800 --> 08:18.999
You know, I bet you haven't even
checked what the sentence is

08:19.000 --> 08:21.919
for conspiracy to commit murder.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.679
It's life, Eric.

08:26.680 --> 08:29.599
Look, if they had
enough evidence,

08:29.600 --> 08:32.039
they'd have charged you
for that already.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.360
They have Jess's statement,
and they have my phone, too!

08:37.200 --> 08:39.479
Kem messaged me
right after the shooting

08:39.480 --> 08:41.519
to say that it was done.

08:41.520 --> 08:42.959
But you deleted that.

08:42.960 --> 08:45.439
Oh, and you think they can't
find something on it?

08:50.200 --> 08:51.719
They haven't charged me yet

08:51.720 --> 08:53.879
'cause they're taking
their time.

08:59.160 --> 09:03.319
I begged you to leave Kem alone,

09:03.320 --> 09:05.959
but you wouldn't fucking listen.

09:16.680 --> 09:18.519
Hey.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.800
Don't, Eric.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.879
Hi, it's Molly.
Leave a message at the beep.

09:32.880 --> 09:34.040
Bye.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.039
Hi, it's Molly.
Leave a message at the beep.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.720
Bye.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.359
Hi. Um, is Molly here,
please?

09:56.360 --> 09:58.799
Uh, no, but is there anything
I can do for you?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.119
No, I'll come back tomorrow.

10:00.120 --> 10:03.199
Uh, she's off until
the 14th of next month.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.479
What? On holidays?

10:06.480 --> 10:08.919
Yeah, she's getting married
and going on her honeymoon.

10:08.920 --> 10:13.359
Wh-- Mo-- Molly with the,
um, blond hair?

10:13.360 --> 10:15.479
Yes.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.999
Y-You sure about that?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.519
Yes, I'm sure.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.959
I...

10:22.960 --> 10:25.120
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

10:28.120 --> 10:30.320
No.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.159
Nikki, can we not
fucking talk about this?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.639
Nikki!

10:40.640 --> 10:43.399
Nikki.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.399
What, I don't deserve
an explanation?

10:45.400 --> 10:47.839
Do I really have to tell you
why this is fucking happening?

10:47.840 --> 10:50.079
But you don't have to make
this decision now.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.919
Here, you're not
walking out of here

10:52.920 --> 10:54.279
till you give me a chance
to talk about this.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.319
Eric, what are you
gonna do, huh?

10:56.320 --> 10:57.839
You're just gonna lock me up?

10:57.840 --> 11:00.559
You're gonna stop me
from leaving?

11:00.560 --> 11:02.239
No.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.640
'Course not.

11:05.600 --> 11:07.079
Nikki, I'll find Jess.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.799
Those charges will be dropped.

11:08.800 --> 11:11.119
Eric, if anything happens
to that girl,

11:11.120 --> 11:13.239
I'll go to
the Garda station myself

11:13.240 --> 11:15.040
and I'll tell them
fucking everything.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.719
Don't even
fucking joke about that.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.639
Who's joking?

11:29.640 --> 11:31.039
On screen
You got lucky, Eric.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.999
But we're on your fucking case.

11:34.800 --> 11:36.599
It won't be long now.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.799
Huh, boys?

11:38.800 --> 11:40.279
Bang, bang!

12:03.480 --> 12:06.079
Oh, hi.
Alright, then.

12:06.080 --> 12:07.879
Your da's not here.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.999
I wanted to see you.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.719
Oh.
Do you want a pint?

12:12.720 --> 12:15.439
No. I need to
show you something.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.240
In private.

12:18.880 --> 12:20.239
John.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.799
I'll be out the back
if you need me.

12:21.800 --> 12:23.559
Yeah.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.919
You got lucky, Eric.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.319
But we're on your fucking case.

12:27.440 --> 12:28.959
It won't be long now.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.879
Huh, boys?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.919
Bang, bang!

12:38.880 --> 12:41.159
Right, I want you to keep this

12:41.160 --> 12:43.559
just between you and me, okay?

12:43.560 --> 12:45.559
Yeah.
And don't you worry,

12:45.560 --> 12:47.359
'cause I'll sort everything.

12:47.360 --> 12:49.159
We'll get these cunts.

12:49.160 --> 12:52.879
You done right coming to me,
alright?

12:52.880 --> 12:54.599
Good boy.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.919
What's this?
Suicide watch?

13:12.920 --> 13:15.080
Don't even joke about that.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.719
Fancy a coffee or something?

13:22.720 --> 13:24.840
Yeah.
Tea would be nice.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.759
Come here.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.840
I was thinking about
what you were saying last night.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.519
I want to go with you
when you go.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.359
What about Bren?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.639
I'm gonna sort that.

13:41.640 --> 13:44.519
He's never gonna let us go.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.280
I have a plan.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.079
Yeah?

13:50.080 --> 13:52.359
What plan?

13:52.360 --> 13:54.560
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

13:56.240 --> 14:00.040
But it's gonna be fine.
I promise.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.479
Fucking hell.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.399
52 years old, and you're still

14:06.400 --> 14:08.239
fighting my Bren battles for me.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.280
That's just what big sisters do.

14:16.120 --> 14:19.159
He was always a cunt.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.640
Even when we were kids.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.039
You know...

14:25.040 --> 14:28.000
I don't have one single
happy memory of him.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.600
Not fucking one.

14:37.520 --> 14:39.799
What about you?

14:49.720 --> 14:52.040
Some of the prison visits
were alright.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.119
That's 'cause he was locked up,

14:58.120 --> 15:01.319
and you knew he wasn't gonna
be able to get to you.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.919
Nikki's gone.

15:38.920 --> 15:40.279
She's moved out.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.079
Why?

15:42.080 --> 15:43.359
Why do you think?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.919
'Cause of Kem
and getting arrested.

15:45.920 --> 15:48.479
We should have left him be.
He was no danger to us.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.479
Where's she gone?

15:50.480 --> 15:51.719
I don't know.

15:51.720 --> 15:55.399
One of her mates' gaffs,
I suppose.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.439
Well, you need to go
and fucking find her

15:57.440 --> 15:59.159
and drag her home.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.359
No, I fucking don't.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.719
What did you fucking say?

16:02.720 --> 16:04.199
I'm not doing that to her.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.399
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm not fucking doing.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.919
I'm not going back inside

16:07.920 --> 16:10.599
because your mot can't
keep her fucking trap shut.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.759
So you need to go and get her
and bring her back into line,

16:13.760 --> 16:15.559
because I fucking
tell you what --

16:15.560 --> 16:17.959
if I get as much
as a fucking whisper

16:17.960 --> 16:19.799
that she's been
blabbing her mouth off,

16:19.800 --> 16:21.880
you'll be digging her up
in the Dublin Mountains.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.919
Yeah?

16:26.920 --> 16:29.079
There's a million
young ones out there

16:29.080 --> 16:31.639
to keep your cock warm.

16:31.640 --> 16:35.439
That doesn't mean you
involve them in your business.

16:35.440 --> 16:38.199
Go and clean
your fucking mess up.

17:28.960 --> 17:31.199
- Rory.
- Hey.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.039
Just thought you should know,
the word is out

17:33.040 --> 17:34.919
that Bren is hiring.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.519
What for?
Don't know,

17:36.520 --> 17:38.119
but he's looking
for lots of lads,

17:38.120 --> 17:40.279
so it must be something big
he's planning.

17:40.280 --> 17:43.919
I'd watch your back
if I was you.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.879
Thanks, Rory.
I appreciate it.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.479
Michael, it's me.

20:21.480 --> 20:25.999
It's open.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.039
Rifat Batuk died this morning.

20:36.040 --> 20:38.519
If Hamza's gonna make a move,
it'll be soon.

20:38.520 --> 20:41.199
We need to push ahead
with Wayne Madigan,

20:41.200 --> 20:44.879
so I set up a meeting
for tomorrow.

20:44.880 --> 20:46.640
Yeah, okay.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.519
I take it, it didn't go well
with Anna, then?

20:53.520 --> 20:56.319
No.

20:56.320 --> 20:59.919
Lost my temper.

20:59.920 --> 21:02.759
Well, teenagers will
do that to you.

21:10.040 --> 21:12.000
Give me one of those.

21:56.480 --> 21:58.920
Is Donal here?
I want to see him.

22:03.160 --> 22:05.759
Donal, Eric Kinsella
is here to see you.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.159
Okay.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.599
Donal will be out in a moment.

22:09.600 --> 22:12.839
Mm.

22:17.280 --> 22:18.559
Everything okay, Eric?

22:18.560 --> 22:23.799
No, everything
isn't fucking okay.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.880
Let's talk about this
in the office.

22:33.480 --> 22:34.799
What's the problem?

22:34.800 --> 22:36.719
The problem is,
I'm sick of you being

22:36.720 --> 22:38.719
Mr. Fucking Doom and Gloom
with Nikki.

22:38.720 --> 22:40.399
Excuse me?
You fucking heard me!

22:40.400 --> 22:42.479
All you're doing
is upsetting her.

22:42.480 --> 22:44.399
She's my client. It's my duty
to be honest with her.

22:44.400 --> 22:48.399
Yeah, I don't give a fuck.
Yeah?

22:48.400 --> 22:50.079
All you've done is upset her,

22:50.080 --> 22:53.599
so you're gonna call her now,
and you're gonna tell her

22:53.600 --> 22:56.319
that things aren't as bad
as you're saying they are.

22:56.320 --> 22:57.559
I can't do that.

22:57.560 --> 23:00.399
Yes, you fucking can,
and you will.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.559
Okay.
I'd like you to leave now.

23:03.560 --> 23:06.799
Yeah?

23:06.800 --> 23:08.720
Not until you've called her.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.399
I'm ringing Bren.

23:12.400 --> 23:15.519
Don't you fucking
walk away from me.

23:16.800 --> 23:19.519
I said, don't you
fucking walk away.

23:23.560 --> 23:24.959
Aah!

23:24.960 --> 23:27.639
Aah! Aah! Aah!

23:32.600 --> 23:34.119
Yeah, Donal?

23:34.120 --> 23:35.799
She better fucking come back.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.799
Donal?
For your sake.

23:37.800 --> 23:40.399
What the fuck is going on there?

24:09.338 --> 24:12.057
We have
all mod cons in the kitchen,

24:12.058 --> 24:13.817
state-of-the-art sauna.

24:13.818 --> 24:16.777
And this room --
there's lots of light.

24:16.778 --> 24:18.738
The views are
really spectacular.

24:21.578 --> 24:22.777
Everything okay?

24:22.778 --> 24:25.617
Yeah.

24:25.618 --> 24:27.937
There's also a gym downstairs

24:27.938 --> 24:30.217
and a roof terrace
for residents.

24:30.218 --> 24:32.497
What do you think, Da?

24:32.498 --> 24:34.897
Should I take it?

24:34.898 --> 24:39.057
Uh, can you give me
a minute here with my son?

24:39.058 --> 24:43.138
Sure.
Thanks.

24:43.938 --> 24:45.497
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

24:45.498 --> 24:49.497
No, I do.
I do like it.

24:49.498 --> 24:51.457
But I just don't want you
forgetting

24:51.458 --> 24:53.977
that this place
is only temporary, Jimmy.

24:53.978 --> 24:56.817
That other house
with your son in it --

24:56.818 --> 24:59.377
you still own that,

24:59.378 --> 25:02.057
and don't let her fucking tell you
otherwise. Okay.

25:02.058 --> 25:03.617
No, I mean it, Jimmy.

25:03.618 --> 25:05.657
Look what she's done.

25:05.658 --> 25:09.457
She's taken all you gave her
and just fucked you out.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.177
It's not as simple as that, Da.

25:11.178 --> 25:13.537
Fucking is as simple as that.

25:13.538 --> 25:16.897
But don't you worry, son,
because you'll be

25:16.898 --> 25:19.497
ruling the roost there
again before long.

25:19.498 --> 25:21.777
That I promise you.

25:21.778 --> 25:23.937
And I tell you what --

25:23.938 --> 25:26.857
you'll get some amount
of fucking hole with this place,

25:26.858 --> 25:29.657
that's for fucking sure, huh?

25:37.418 --> 25:39.457
So what's the story
with you and that girl

25:39.458 --> 25:41.257
I saw sneaking out?

25:41.258 --> 25:43.098
Oh, I don't want
to talk about it.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.657
Sometimes opening up helps.

25:48.658 --> 25:51.177
Mm.
Is that what you do?

25:52.898 --> 25:54.817
Absolutely not.

25:58.978 --> 26:02.537
Anna likes Bren.

26:02.538 --> 26:04.458
That's what she told me.

26:06.498 --> 26:11.098
Thinks he's a -- a nice old man
who buys her presents.

26:14.938 --> 26:17.338
Oh, fuck.

26:19.658 --> 26:21.937
And she thinks that
I deliberately try

26:21.938 --> 26:24.418
to keep her away
from the family.

26:33.738 --> 26:35.577
Do you?

26:35.578 --> 26:37.217
Probably.
I don't know.

26:37.218 --> 26:39.058
Just trying to protect her.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.737
What, from us?

26:44.738 --> 26:46.617
Well, I don't know.

26:46.618 --> 26:49.018
From this.
From this life, you know?

26:54.698 --> 26:56.697
After what happened to Jamie...

26:56.698 --> 26:59.058
You know, I can't lose
another child to this.

27:03.218 --> 27:05.498
Sorry.

27:08.178 --> 27:10.977
I don't know.

28:04.938 --> 28:07.657
Fuck.

28:39.698 --> 28:41.657
Alright, Derek?

28:41.658 --> 28:43.617
Yeah, listen,
gonna need that yoke

28:43.618 --> 28:45.457
I was asking you about.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.258
Yeah, tomorrow.

28:49.138 --> 28:52.297
Sound.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.977
Yeah, yeah.
See you then.

28:59.258 --> 29:02.057
Bren.
You wanted to see me?

29:02.058 --> 29:05.377
Yeah.
Come here.

29:10.378 --> 29:13.457
Do you want to earn yourself
20 grand?

29:13.458 --> 29:15.377
What have I got to do, Bren?

29:15.378 --> 29:17.577
"What have I got to do,
Bren?"

29:17.578 --> 29:19.137
You're either in or you're not,

29:19.138 --> 29:21.497
'cause I've no time
for windy cunts.

29:21.498 --> 29:24.377
So do you want to earn 20 grand
or don't you?

29:24.378 --> 29:26.697
Okay.
Okay what?

29:26.698 --> 29:28.297
I want to make 20 grand.

29:28.298 --> 29:31.377
Good lad.
Here's what I want you to do.

29:54.018 --> 29:57.257
Frank. Frank.
Stand up.

29:57.258 --> 29:59.337
Up.
Come on. Up.

29:59.338 --> 30:02.417
Up, up, up, up.

30:02.418 --> 30:07.497
Up, up you get.
Go on.

30:07.498 --> 30:10.257
- Dan the man!
- Yep, yep, yep.

30:10.258 --> 30:11.977
Alright, let's go.

30:45.258 --> 30:47.338
Thanks for getting me.

30:50.178 --> 30:52.178
No bother.

30:53.818 --> 30:57.137
I won't forget this.

30:57.138 --> 31:01.817
You're a good boy, Dan.

31:01.818 --> 31:06.497
Tell you what, I'll set you up
with something before I go.

31:06.498 --> 31:09.337
What do you mean?

31:09.338 --> 31:11.977
Something cushy.

31:11.978 --> 31:15.337
What do you mean, "go"?

31:15.338 --> 31:17.697
Go where?

31:17.698 --> 31:19.617
Somewhere nice.

31:19.618 --> 31:23.057
Where?

31:23.058 --> 31:26.057
You don't have to know
about that.

31:26.058 --> 31:29.737
You don't have
to worry about it.

31:29.738 --> 31:32.017
All you need to know is that

31:32.018 --> 31:34.817
I'll look after you.

32:20.698 --> 32:23.338
You're up early.

32:24.858 --> 32:27.297
I'm going to training.

32:27.298 --> 32:30.017
Sorry I wasn't here last night.

32:30.018 --> 32:31.937
I had to go out for work.

32:31.938 --> 32:33.738
Without your car?

32:37.698 --> 32:40.337
Yeah.

33:27.378 --> 33:30.337
Just thought
I'd bring this back.

33:30.338 --> 33:32.257
How have you been?

33:32.258 --> 33:33.857
Haven't seen you at mass.

33:33.858 --> 33:35.337
I'm great, you know.

33:35.338 --> 33:41.017
Really, really good.

33:41.018 --> 33:43.138
Thank you.

33:48.418 --> 33:50.057
This is for the window
that I broke.

33:50.058 --> 33:51.617
You don't owe us anything.

33:51.618 --> 33:53.658
Well, take it.
I w-- I want you to have it.

33:57.538 --> 34:00.097
Mm.

34:00.098 --> 34:03.338
And, uh, this is just
for the collection, okay?

34:08.058 --> 34:11.297
Money can't bring you
peace of mind.

34:11.298 --> 34:14.618
Spoken like someone
who's never had any.

34:16.658 --> 34:20.537
You'll never truly be happy.

34:20.538 --> 34:23.098
Not with the life you live.

34:26.178 --> 34:29.857
What about the life
that you live?

34:29.858 --> 34:32.658
Will you ever be happy?

34:36.618 --> 34:39.777
I mean, look at this place.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.497
It's dying on its fucking arse.

34:42.498 --> 34:43.937
You know, when I was a kid,

34:43.938 --> 34:45.817
there used to be four masses
here every Sunday.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.497
They'd be packed out the door.

34:47.498 --> 34:49.817
Now you couldn't even
fucking pay people to come.

34:49.818 --> 34:51.617
We've plenty of parishioners.

34:51.618 --> 34:55.057
Plenty of parishioners.

34:55.058 --> 34:57.017
Come on.

34:57.018 --> 34:59.857
You're fucking deluded.

34:59.858 --> 35:02.257
You're like one of them,
um, soldiers

35:02.258 --> 35:04.857
that they find living
all alone on an island,

35:04.858 --> 35:06.337
still got the uniform
and the gun,

35:06.338 --> 35:09.178
but no one's told you
that the war ended decades ago.

35:12.698 --> 35:14.537
You need to know when it's time
to get out, Father.

35:14.538 --> 35:17.017
You see, that's the trick.

35:17.018 --> 35:19.657
I'll pray for you.

35:19.658 --> 35:21.417
I'll pray for you, Frank.

35:26.938 --> 35:31.337
Here.
Why don't you take it all.

36:01.423 --> 36:03.023
Hey.

36:05.183 --> 36:07.223
Hey.
Hey.

36:16.663 --> 36:18.542
Can I, uh, get you anything?

36:18.543 --> 36:20.703
No, I'm grand, thanks.

36:24.263 --> 36:27.143
I felt like a teenager
coming in this morning.

36:29.943 --> 36:32.903
I feel like we should talk
about what happened last night.

36:36.943 --> 36:39.263
Depends on what
you're gonna say.

36:40.423 --> 36:43.742
'Cause I don't feel bad
about what we did,

36:43.743 --> 36:46.183
and I don't want to feel bad.

36:48.343 --> 36:51.662
It's dangerous.

36:51.663 --> 36:53.582
Do you regret it?

36:53.583 --> 36:56.502
No.

36:56.503 --> 36:59.462
No, I don't regret it.
I just --

36:59.463 --> 37:01.302
I'm not saying that.
I'm just saying, like,

37:01.303 --> 37:03.583
I don't see how it can work.

37:07.743 --> 37:10.863
What we do is our own business.

37:15.783 --> 37:17.983
We'll hurt people.

37:22.623 --> 37:25.622
Well...

37:25.623 --> 37:28.303
nobody knows about it.

37:30.223 --> 37:32.743
And nobody needs to.

37:49.983 --> 37:54.142
- Hiya.
- Hiya.

37:56.743 --> 37:58.502
You alright?

37:58.503 --> 38:00.463
Yeah.

38:02.623 --> 38:04.982
Okay, so...

38:04.983 --> 38:07.303
how are we gonna do this?

38:18.583 --> 38:20.342
This better fucking work.

38:20.343 --> 38:22.823
'Course it works.
It's brand fucking new.

38:25.743 --> 38:28.102
Here.
Put that away somewhere.

38:28.103 --> 38:29.782
You know where
you're meeting, yeah?

38:29.783 --> 38:31.262
Yeah.

38:31.263 --> 38:33.062
The car's already there.

38:33.063 --> 38:35.222
Here.

38:35.223 --> 38:38.502
Grand.
Don't fuck this up.

38:38.503 --> 38:40.103
I won't.

38:41.423 --> 38:43.383
I won't.

38:44.343 --> 38:47.022
Go on, then.
Get a fucking move on.

38:52.223 --> 38:54.382
I know you don't want
to hear this, Mikey,

38:54.383 --> 38:58.623
but simplest thing would be
to pay someone else to do it.

39:01.143 --> 39:03.302
No.

39:03.303 --> 39:05.342
Birdy's right.
No.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.142
I'm doing this one.

39:07.143 --> 39:09.662
We're gonna need
help with this.

39:09.663 --> 39:11.942
You can't do this on your own.

39:11.943 --> 39:14.662
What about Frank?

39:14.663 --> 39:19.342
No, I don't think
he has it in him.

39:19.343 --> 39:20.942
Jimmy?

39:20.943 --> 39:22.782
He's tight with Bren.

39:22.783 --> 39:25.902
Who then?

39:25.903 --> 39:28.383
We still need someone to drive.

39:30.343 --> 39:31.822
How's the hiring going?

39:31.823 --> 39:34.982
Good. Got some sound lads
lined up for you.

39:34.983 --> 39:38.622
Sit down there a minute.

39:38.623 --> 39:41.182
Do you still do
designer clothes and shit?

39:41.183 --> 39:43.782
Yeah, clothes, shoes,
watches, jewelry.

39:43.783 --> 39:45.982
Whatever you want,
we can get it,

39:45.983 --> 39:47.862
just like the real thing.

39:49.823 --> 39:53.382
I'm looking for
something like this,

39:53.383 --> 39:55.142
for my granddaughter.

39:55.143 --> 39:57.742
I don't give a fuck
what it costs.

39:57.743 --> 40:00.702
I want a dress
that looks classy like that.

40:00.703 --> 40:03.622
Yeah.

40:03.623 --> 40:05.543
Can get you something like this.

41:08.943 --> 41:10.742
It's me.

41:10.743 --> 41:13.462
We're moving
against the Kinsellas.

41:13.463 --> 41:15.422
Money, men,

41:15.423 --> 41:18.902
guns, anything you need,
we'll provide.

41:18.903 --> 41:20.982
Okay.

41:20.983 --> 41:23.302
How long do you need
to get everything prepared?

41:23.303 --> 41:25.462
Couple weeks.
That's too long.

41:25.463 --> 41:27.462
One week.

41:27.463 --> 41:28.982
And then we move.

41:28.983 --> 41:31.622
I want the Kinsellas
wiped out as soon as possible.

41:31.623 --> 41:33.502
Fine.

41:42.623 --> 41:44.462
Zehab answer all your questions?

41:44.463 --> 41:46.502
Pretty much.

41:46.503 --> 41:49.422
I told him you can get cheap
shit fenethylline anywhere,

41:49.423 --> 41:52.062
but all you're buying
is fucking caffeine and sugar.

41:52.063 --> 41:54.702
This stuff is top quality.

41:54.703 --> 41:57.742
You see us shipping it ourselves
or leaving that to him?

41:57.743 --> 41:59.622
We'd rather not worry
about that.

41:59.623 --> 42:01.502
What size order
are you thinking?

42:01.503 --> 42:03.502
Nothing too big to start with.

42:03.503 --> 42:05.782
We each put in half a million.

42:05.783 --> 42:07.822
Test the market.
See how it goes down.

42:07.823 --> 42:10.102
You don't have to worry.
These sell everywhere.

42:10.103 --> 42:12.742
Big profits, too.
You put in one million,

42:12.743 --> 42:14.102
you make at least
three and a half back.

42:14.103 --> 42:15.662
How long does it take
to get here?

42:15.663 --> 42:19.142
From Syria? A few weeks.

42:19.143 --> 42:21.502
Has to be quicker than that,
or I'm not interested.

42:21.503 --> 42:25.582
Well, how quick?
Next few days.

42:25.583 --> 42:27.622
This is a good deal.

42:27.623 --> 42:29.742
There's a lot of money
to be made.

42:29.743 --> 42:32.902
It's only good for me
if it's here when I need it.

42:32.903 --> 42:35.302
For this size order,
I probably could get it quickly

42:35.303 --> 42:36.902
from my colleagues in UK,

42:36.903 --> 42:39.382
but for bigger orders,
will take longer.

42:47.783 --> 42:49.702
Okay.

42:49.703 --> 42:52.862
Lodge your half
into that account.

42:52.863 --> 42:54.702
We'll transfer it on.

42:54.703 --> 42:58.062
Sooner we get it,
sooner it gets done.

42:58.063 --> 43:00.142
You'll have it
by the end of the day.

43:14.743 --> 43:18.022
That's our half there, in cash.

43:27.463 --> 43:30.262
Da, you know Gary Mahon?

43:30.263 --> 43:33.502
Gary from Snaketown?

43:33.503 --> 43:37.182
Wait till you see
what he fucking sent me.

43:37.183 --> 43:38.862
On screen
You got lucky, Eric.

43:38.863 --> 43:40.542
But we're on your fucking case.

43:42.463 --> 43:43.862
It won't be long now.

43:43.863 --> 43:45.862
Know who that
little ginger cunt is?

43:45.863 --> 43:47.342
Bang, bang!

43:47.343 --> 43:49.542
He's the lad who killed Jamie.

43:49.543 --> 43:51.942
He's the lad who took
a shot at Viking.

43:51.943 --> 43:55.703
We have to fucking get him, Da.

43:58.703 --> 44:02.862
I want to do this, for Jamie.

44:02.863 --> 44:05.103
Let me have a think about it.

44:06.983 --> 44:09.702
What's there to fucking
think about? We owe him.

44:09.703 --> 44:11.742
I don't want us rushing
into something stupid.

44:11.743 --> 44:15.542
Wha--

44:15.543 --> 44:19.462
Yeah?

44:19.463 --> 44:23.062
Yeah, send him in.

44:23.063 --> 44:27.422
I said I'd fucking
think about it, didn't I?

44:28.983 --> 44:30.982
Yeah, come in.

44:36.823 --> 44:39.383
What the fuck is so important?

44:40.983 --> 44:43.543
Well?

44:44.023 --> 44:46.462
It's about Frank.

44:46.463 --> 44:48.302
What about him?

45:06.943 --> 45:09.982
Everything okay?

45:09.983 --> 45:12.462
No.

45:12.463 --> 45:13.663
What's happened?

45:16.063 --> 45:18.502
Nikki's gone.

45:18.503 --> 45:20.982
What do you mean, gone?

45:27.423 --> 45:30.342
I've already been around
all her mates' gaffs.

45:30.343 --> 45:33.982
They say they don't know
where she is.

45:33.983 --> 45:36.103
She's not answering
any of my calls.

45:38.463 --> 45:41.502
What are they charging her with?

45:41.503 --> 45:44.183
Conspiracy to murder.

45:47.663 --> 45:49.742
What have they got on her?

45:51.543 --> 45:53.862
A statement.

45:53.863 --> 45:57.782
From Kem's mott, Jess,

45:57.783 --> 46:00.143
Saying that she saw
Nikki pay him for the killing.

46:04.703 --> 46:10.102
And...

46:10.103 --> 46:13.542
maybe a text from Kem

46:13.543 --> 46:16.702
saying it was done.

46:16.703 --> 46:19.022
You never should have

46:19.023 --> 46:20.662
let Nikki handle
all that money herself.

46:20.663 --> 46:24.222
I know.
I know that.

46:24.223 --> 46:31.622
I know I fucked up.
Just...

46:31.623 --> 46:33.102
What was I supposed to do?

46:33.103 --> 46:35.062
Come to me.

46:35.063 --> 46:38.582
That's what you were supposed
to fucking do, Eric.

46:38.583 --> 46:40.903
I would have arranged
everything.

46:43.223 --> 46:45.982
I'm coming to you now.

46:56.343 --> 46:58.942
I am gonna help you fix this,

46:58.943 --> 47:02.862
but you're gonna have to
help me with something.

47:17.103 --> 47:19.142
He's parked outside
his aunt's house.

47:19.143 --> 47:21.502
We should be going now
before he moves.

47:21.503 --> 47:22.942
No panic.
We'll get him.

47:22.943 --> 47:24.582
Just keep an eye on
where he's going.

47:29.463 --> 47:31.062
Sure you don't want one?

47:31.063 --> 47:33.942
No, bro, they rot your teeth.

47:33.943 --> 47:35.422
And that doesn't?

47:35.423 --> 47:37.502
What, my frozen water?

47:40.223 --> 47:41.782
Just don't spill it
in my car, yeah?

47:41.783 --> 47:43.342
Shut your mouth, will you?

47:46.703 --> 47:48.663
Fuck.

47:58.583 --> 48:01.102
Did you get them?
Yeah. Go, go. Come on.

48:12.023 --> 48:13.662
Watch, watch, watch!

48:13.663 --> 48:15.662
Fuck!

48:24.743 --> 48:26.622
Drive.
Just fucking drive!
