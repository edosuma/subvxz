you into a young queen.

23:10.476 --> 23:12.216
She really got you worked over.

23:12.260 --> 23:13.522

personalities.

She's passive aggressive
and manipulative.

23:30.496 --> 23:33.020
Did you ask her to marry you

23:33.063 --> 23:37.285
or did she drop a dash
of hints and ultimatums?

23:37.328 --> 23:39.679

of the Lord, mister,

tone it down.

26:08.349 --> 26:10.220

26:10.264 --> 26:11.744
but you better get the
hell out of my face.

26:11.787 --> 26:12.527
- Or what?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.398

26:14.442 --> 26:15.922
I see how you look at me.

26:15.965 --> 26:18.402
I don't care much
for you either.

26:20.361 --> 26:22.624
and I don't want you around Q.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.278
- Really?
- Really.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.107
- And I'm not gonna go anywhere.

26:28.499 --> 26:32.547
If anybody's gonna go
somewhere, that would be you.

- [Erica] Hey, what are you
two talking about over here?

26:35.594 --> 26:40.555
- Oh nothing, just trying to
get to know my new family.

26:42.078 --> 26:44.298
- Okay, well you have plenty
of time to do all that.

26:44.341 --> 26:45.691
- Yeah!

26:45.734 --> 26:46.474
- Now we just need to see
if you can do the Nene

26:46.517 --> 26:47.954
in your wedding dress.

26:47.997 --> 26:49.695
Exactly.
- Right!

26:49.738 --> 26:52.480
- Before the wedding
planner gets here.

26:52.523 --> 26:54.308
- Okay, see you later.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.095
- Man, I'm just happy to
finally meet this family

26:59.139 --> 27:00.836
I heard so much about.

27:02.142 --> 27:04.187
- Guilty as charged,
I told him everything.

27:04.231 --> 27:08.191
- We're happy to finally
meet you too, Blaine.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.280
And who's this beautiful
woman you have with you?

27:10.324 --> 27:12.239
- Thank you, I'm Naomi.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.284
- [Woman] She is gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

27:14.328 --> 27:15.416
- [Woman] How long
have you been dating?

27:15.459 --> 27:17.418
- [Brian] About two years.

27:19.202 --> 27:20.856
- [Woman] Okay, this is a first.

27:20.900 --> 27:24.512
I have never seen him
give public affection.

27:24.555 --> 27:26.427
- How was your
trip from Atlanta?

27:26.470 --> 27:28.211
- You know what, it was good.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.910
Except I had to sit next
to this public speaker.

27:30.953 --> 27:32.215
- [Woman] What was
wrong with that?

27:32.259 --> 27:33.390
I'm sure you had a
great conversation.

27:33.434 --> 27:34.696
- Oh we had a
wonderful conversation

27:34.740 --> 27:37.351
for about the first
20 or 30 minutes.

27:37.394 --> 27:38.482
But after that I'm
not trying to hear

27:38.526 --> 27:40.441
how you prepare to
talk for a living, bro.

27:40.484 --> 27:42.443
I mean, that's crazy.

27:42.486 --> 27:44.097
- It couldn't have
been all that bad.

27:44.140 --> 27:45.707
- I wish I could agree with you

27:45.751 --> 27:49.058
but for those two
hours I was miserable.

27:49.102 --> 27:51.321
- Well welcome to Houston

27:51.365 --> 27:54.498
where there's a restaurant
on almost every corner

27:54.542 --> 27:58.415
and for the most part the
people will leave you alone.

27:58.459 --> 27:59.590
- That's good to hear.

27:59.634 --> 28:02.681
- Now back to the
bride and the groom.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.729
I am a very, very firm believer

28:07.773 --> 28:10.384
that marriage is
about, is about,

28:12.691 --> 28:14.475
what is the the word--

28:15.650 --> 28:18.261
- Compromise?
- Ah, compromise!

28:18.305 --> 28:19.872
Yes, ain't that right, baby?

28:19.915 --> 28:21.874
- Yes.
- Yes, indeed.

28:21.917 --> 28:24.354
- Some compromise
more than others.

28:24.398 --> 28:25.181
- Hey!

28:26.835 --> 28:28.402
What is it you say?

28:28.445 --> 28:30.099
Uh-uh, now you know, you know--

28:30.143 --> 28:31.492
- Pop.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.842
Pop, you digging yourself
in a hole, chill out.

28:33.886 --> 28:37.106
- Ah, nonsense, listen,
listen, nonsense.

28:37.150 --> 28:40.196
Oh everybody knows
that in a marriage

28:41.502 --> 28:43.852
there's only one who's right.

28:43.896 --> 28:45.985
The other is the husband.

28:47.290 --> 28:48.727
- Oh okay, I'm taking notes.

28:48.770 --> 28:51.294
So as long as we get that right

28:51.338 --> 28:54.167
then everything else
works out, right Florence?

28:54.210 --> 28:55.559
- You said it, girl.

28:55.603 --> 28:57.605
- Mm, very smart girl.

28:57.648 --> 28:58.998
I like her.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.303
- I like you too.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.177
- Hey brother I think you
might want to hit that barber

29:04.220 --> 29:06.092
before you end up on the couch.

29:06.135 --> 29:09.660
- I'm way ahead of
you, way ahead of you.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.881
- So Q.
- What's up, man?

29:12.925 --> 29:14.361
- How you feeling, man?

29:14.404 --> 29:15.449
- I'm feeling good, really good.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.406
- Aww.

29:16.450 --> 29:19.366
- I'm glad you said that.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.454
Because you know
it's over, right?

29:20.497 --> 29:22.282
[laughing]

29:22.325 --> 29:24.240
- Blaine.
- Just messing with you.

29:24.284 --> 29:26.634
Listen brother, you
have the total package

29:26.677 --> 29:28.505
sitting right next to you.
- [Claudia] Thank you.

29:28.549 --> 29:29.724
- The perfect wife.

29:30.681 --> 29:33.206
- If anything comes across us,

29:33.249 --> 29:35.469
we'll most definitely
take care of it.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.427
Ain't that right, baby?

29:37.471 --> 29:39.038
- Yes.

29:39.081 --> 29:42.563
- Yeah, Q, sis told me that
you was a photographer.

29:42.606 --> 29:43.694
- [Q] Yes, sir.

29:43.738 --> 29:45.218
- Man, how you get into that?

29:45.261 --> 29:46.915
- Well, when I
was in high school

29:46.959 --> 29:49.091
I was on the yearbook committee

29:49.135 --> 29:51.485
and one day we were taking
photos of the debate team

29:51.528 --> 29:53.487
and the photographer got sick,

29:53.530 --> 29:57.491
so they asked me to take
his place and figure it out.

29:57.534 --> 29:59.101
- [Blaine] Oh okay.

29:59.145 --> 30:01.756
- I guess I did a good
job 'cause word got around

30:01.800 --> 30:03.758
that I was a good photographer.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.369
- So what kind of
photography do you do?

30:06.413 --> 30:10.243
- Oh, birthdays, weddings,
quinceaneras mostly,

30:10.286 --> 30:12.114
stuff like that, you know.

30:12.158 --> 30:14.029
- My words exactly.

30:14.073 --> 30:15.248
- Your words exactly,

30:15.291 --> 30:17.990
then why is she talking
for you now, huh?

30:18.033 --> 30:19.252
- Pop!

30:19.295 --> 30:21.080
- Come on now, see
how he speaks to you,

30:21.123 --> 30:22.168
she takes the words
out of your mouth.

30:22.211 --> 30:22.777
That is not the Ugandan way.

30:23.734 --> 30:25.345
- Pops, this is my wedding.

30:25.388 --> 30:27.651
- You need to put some
respect on my name!

30:27.695 --> 30:29.131
Respect on my name!

30:32.482 --> 30:33.875
[shouting]

30:33.919 --> 30:35.746
- What's that about?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.488
- Excuse me, mister.

30:38.532 --> 30:39.750
It's time for the toast.

30:39.794 --> 30:40.577
- Great.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.363
- Be nice.
- Okay.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.675
Can I have everyone's attention?

30:51.719 --> 30:53.547
I'd like to make a toast.

30:53.590 --> 30:57.594
I've known Q for more than
20 years now, right bud?

30:59.292 --> 31:02.817
He's been there for me
when no one else was.

31:02.861 --> 31:04.558
He's the most honest person

31:04.601 --> 31:07.561
and all around great
guy that I know.

31:07.604 --> 31:10.564
And I know for certain that
he'll be such a great husband,

31:10.607 --> 31:13.654
that whenever I
decide to get married,

31:13.697 --> 31:15.569
he'll put me to shame.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.614
I just know it.

31:17.658 --> 31:19.790
And it's been an honor
to have met Claudia.

31:19.834 --> 31:22.054
She's been more
than an inspiration

31:22.097 --> 31:25.971
than I could ever,
ever, ever imagined.

31:26.014 --> 31:29.975
Q is definitely a lucky
guy to have met her

31:30.018 --> 31:32.716
and I wish them a
lifetime of happiness

31:32.760 --> 31:36.459
and I know that she'll
be the perfect wife.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.071
To happiness.

31:39.114 --> 31:40.811
- [All] To happiness.

care of my husband.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.111
- Is that right?

32:19.154 --> 32:20.242
- No problem.

32:21.504 --> 32:22.766
So what do you have
planned for today?

32:22.810 --> 32:24.899
- [Q] I have a couple
of photo shoots.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.857
- Here at the studio?

32:26.901 --> 32:28.685
- Yeah, I got one
here and another one

32:28.729 --> 32:31.862
on another location in midtown.

32:31.906 --> 32:32.733
- Not of half naked women.

32:33.864 --> 32:34.909
- Oh yeah, Uncle
Luke and his dancers

32:35.866 --> 32:37.607
should be here any minute.

32:37.651 --> 32:39.348
- That's not funny.

32:40.915 --> 32:42.177
It's not funny.

32:43.265 --> 32:45.224
- Baby, do you trust me?

32:47.313 --> 32:48.096
Baby.

32:49.576 --> 32:50.359
- Yes.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.798
- Baby, if you trust me
then there should be nothing

32:54.842 --> 32:56.539
to worry about, okay?

32:57.932 --> 32:59.716
- Okay, if you say so.

33:00.891 --> 33:02.981
- [Q] Thank you.

33:03.024 --> 33:05.157
[kissing]

33:12.773 --> 33:15.384
[scary music]

33:18.474 --> 33:19.258
[punching]

33:19.301 --> 33:21.564
[grunting]

33:31.792 --> 33:32.836
Okay.

33:35.752 --> 33:39.756
- Class, we've been going
over this material all week

33:39.800 --> 33:42.846
and I expect you all to know it.

33:42.890 --> 33:45.849
There's going to
be a test tomorrow.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.726
- Um, excuse me,

33:52.769 --> 33:54.380
why are we going over the
eighth amendment anyway?

33:54.423 --> 33:55.598
It's not like I'm
gonna need to know

33:55.642 --> 33:56.817
anything about that next year

33:56.860 --> 33:59.733
when I'm working as a
plumber with my old man.

33:59.776 --> 34:02.127
- Zachary, Zachary, Zachary,

34:03.737 --> 34:07.262
you have to be more well
rounded as an individual.

34:07.306 --> 34:10.744
And knowing your history will
help you in the long run,

34:10.786 --> 34:11.571
trust me.

34:12.833 --> 34:15.661
- Yeah, whatever,
let you tell it.

34:15.705 --> 34:19.882
- Oh boy, you're gonna
have to learn the hard way.

34:22.799 --> 34:24.322
[bell ringing]

34:24.366 --> 34:25.802
Class is dismissed.

34:29.806 --> 34:30.590
Not you.

34:33.940 --> 34:36.639
If you don't pass
that test tomorrow,

34:36.683 --> 34:39.902
guess who I'm going
to call this weekend?

34:42.949 --> 34:44.952
Zachary, study page 105.

34:47.650 --> 34:48.434
Go on.

34:49.826 --> 34:52.481
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, excuse you.

35:12.066 --> 35:13.589
Well, well, well.

35:19.639 --> 35:20.814
Shouldn't you be

35:23.033 --> 35:23.904
eating lunch?

35:41.835 --> 35:43.924
I'm looking for a camera.

35:45.534 --> 35:48.929
- Do you know what kind of
camera you're looking for?

35:48.972 --> 35:52.541
- A kind of camera you can
hide in a secretive place.

35:52.585 --> 35:53.934
- This bear has a camera inside.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.719
Some people use
it as a nanny cam.

36:04.249 --> 36:06.686
- That's exactly what I want.

36:06.729 --> 36:07.600
How much?

36:07.643 --> 36:09.036
- [Clerk] 79.99.

36:13.736 --> 36:15.260
- Come on boy, come on.

36:15.303 --> 36:16.696
- Hurry up, man.

36:17.566 --> 36:18.132
[door slamming]

36:19.089 --> 36:20.003
Hey baby, how was work?

36:20.047 --> 36:21.570
- Up, up, up man.

36:27.663 --> 36:28.925
Just do it, dude!

36:28.969 --> 36:32.538
- Kids at school, two
grown ass kids at home.

36:52.340 --> 36:54.386
- Hey, what is wrong with you?

36:54.429 --> 36:55.778
You can't be talking
to me like that,

36:55.822 --> 36:57.563
especially not in
front of my homeboy.

36:57.606 --> 36:58.912
- Who, Anthony?

36:58.955 --> 37:02.263
He ain't shit and I can
talk to you any way I want.

37:02.307 --> 37:04.047
You ain't gonna do shit,

37:04.091 --> 37:07.137
taking pictures of half
naked women in the day

37:07.181 --> 37:09.792
and hanging with
fucking bums at night.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.054
- You need to check yourself.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.013
- Get your hands off of me!

37:13.056 --> 37:14.971
- You are way out of line!
- Me?

37:15.015 --> 37:16.625
- Just because you
had a bad day at work

37:16.669 --> 37:18.410
don't mean you can
bring that shit here.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.891
- Oh, I see someone wants
to put me in my place.

37:21.935 --> 37:24.111
- Well somebody has to.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.985
- Just give me a minute

37:30.117 --> 37:32.641
and I'll go
apologize to Anthony.

37:36.863 --> 37:37.646
That hurt.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.746
[remote banging]

37:50.790 --> 37:51.965
- What the hell?

37:53.619 --> 37:54.968
Fucking crazy ass.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.145
Yo Q, I'm out!

38:06.153 --> 38:09.025
[Claudia mumbling]

38:10.375 --> 38:13.160
- Hey bro, see you later.
- Alright man.

38:18.992 --> 38:21.342
- Hey babe, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.084
- Okay, I'm gonna grab
myself a bite to eat

38:24.127 --> 38:26.391
from the kitchen and
then I'll be right there

38:26.434 --> 38:28.218
in just a few minutes.

38:58.161 --> 39:01.426
[train engine humming]

39:08.258 --> 39:11.087
[phone ringing]

39:11.131 --> 39:13.220
- Hello?
- Hello, Blaine?

39:13.263 --> 39:16.005
Hey, I hope I'm
not disturbing you.

39:16.049 --> 39:17.659
- Oh no, you good, Q.

39:17.703 --> 39:18.573
How you doing, brother?

39:18.617 --> 39:19.835
- I'm fine.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.142
I'm just concerned
about Claudia.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.797
- Wait hold on, is she alright?

39:24.840 --> 39:25.928
- She's fine.

39:27.234 --> 39:29.105
- Okay well what's
the problem then?

39:29.149 --> 39:31.194
- Man, we argue a lot and--

39:31.238 --> 39:32.326
- Oh wait, hold on Q.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.197
Listen, that's my
baby sister, man,

39:34.241 --> 39:36.156
and I don't get involved
in her personal business.

39:36.199 --> 39:37.766
- I understand, man,

39:37.810 --> 39:40.073
but she lashes out
seemingly out of nowhere.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.249
And then she gets
angry all the time.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.511
- Okay, well is she
taking her meds?

39:43.555 --> 39:44.338
- Meds?

39:46.079 --> 39:47.254
What meds?

39:47.297 --> 39:49.256
- She's bipolar, bro.

39:49.299 --> 39:54.261
She been diagnosed with it since
she was about 12 years old.

39:55.175 --> 39:56.176
Hello, you still there?

39:56.219 --> 39:58.744
- Yeah, yeah man, I'm here.

39:58.787 --> 40:01.181
- Oh you didn't know.

40:01.224 --> 40:02.443
Man, did I say too much?

40:02.487 --> 40:04.184
- No, everything's okay man.

40:04.227 --> 40:07.883
Let me just call you
back later, alright, bye.

40:07.927 --> 40:08.710
- Alright.

40:28.382 --> 40:31.167
[drawers banging]

40:47.401 --> 40:52.145
- Where do crazy bitches put
their fucking medicines at?

42:08.003 --> 42:08.743
Fuck.

42:20.450 --> 42:21.190
Bitch.

42:22.496 --> 42:26.282
- Babe, what are you
doing sitting in the dark?

42:27.675 --> 42:29.329
- Baby, sit down.

42:29.372 --> 42:31.897
- Ooh, someone's being dramatic.

42:33.246 --> 42:33.986
What's up?

42:35.248 --> 42:36.379
- Is there something
that you need to tell me

42:36.423 --> 42:39.208
about yourself that
I don't know about?

42:39.252 --> 42:41.471
- Is this what this is about?

42:42.777 --> 42:45.040
- Just answer the question.

42:46.259 --> 42:49.392
- No, you pretty
much know everything.

42:49.436 --> 42:51.394
- Are you sure about that?

43:03.450 --> 43:06.453
- You've been going
through my stuff.

43:09.369 --> 43:10.413
You had no right.

43:10.457 --> 43:12.372
- I had a lot of fucking rights.

43:12.415 --> 43:14.592
Why have you been
hiding this from me?

43:14.635 --> 43:16.419
- This is my business.

43:18.334 --> 43:20.032
Not yours.

43:20.075 --> 43:21.773
- This is our business.

43:21.816 --> 43:23.035
And it looks like
you should be taking

43:23.078 --> 43:25.124
our business twice a day.

43:26.342 --> 43:28.344
- Okay, I couldn't tell you

43:29.955 --> 43:33.436
because I didn't want you
to look at me differently.

43:33.480 --> 43:38.441
- We can't be hiding anything
else from each other, okay?

43:39.007 --> 43:39.486
- Okay.

43:41.967 --> 43:43.708
- What about the
teddy bear camera?

43:43.751 --> 43:45.710
- Oh!
- You spying on me?

43:47.494 --> 43:50.453
- No, that's just
for protection.

43:50.497 --> 43:53.239
We had one of those in
the house in Atlanta

43:53.282 --> 43:54.980
when I was growing up.

43:56.372 --> 43:59.506
- You're making this so
hard for me to trust you.

43:59.549 --> 44:00.855
Is there anything that
you need to tell me

44:00.899 --> 44:03.379
about yourself
that I don't know?

44:03.423 --> 44:07.209
- Honestly, there's
nothing else, I promise.

44:11.561 --> 44:12.345
- Okay.

44:14.608 --> 44:15.391
Come here.

44:16.915 --> 44:17.655
Come here.

44:18.830 --> 44:21.702
[electronic music]

44:38.458 --> 44:39.720
[knocking]

44:39.764 --> 44:42.462
So this is where
the magic happens?

44:44.159 --> 44:45.900
- Hey babe.
- Hey baby.

44:47.162 --> 44:48.903
- I didn't know you
were coming here.

44:48.947 --> 44:50.165
It's good to see you.

44:50.209 --> 44:51.514
- Hey, good to see you too.

44:51.558 --> 44:54.343
I just decided to
bring some lunch

44:54.387 --> 44:55.301
so we can eat together.

44:55.344 --> 44:56.432
- Oh awesome.

44:56.476 --> 44:58.870
- And you also forgot these.

45:00.349 --> 45:01.742
- Oh thanks for coming.

45:01.786 --> 45:06.225
- Yeah, you were supposed to
take these at 12 with food.

45:07.530 --> 45:09.576
- That's right, honey.

45:09.619 --> 45:12.405
- Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't
know you had company.

45:12.448 --> 45:14.842
- Oh it's okay, Miss
Chambers, come in.

45:14.886 --> 45:17.323
This is my husband A-cu-ru.

45:17.366 --> 45:19.978
- Hi.
- A-cu-ru, Miss Chambers.

45:20.021 --> 45:23.590
- Hey, it's nice to
meet you, Miss Chambers.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.462
- Yeah, likewise.
- Yeah.

45:27.507 --> 45:28.551
- [Claudia] You hungry?

45:28.595 --> 45:30.553
You look a little bit famished.

45:30.597 --> 45:31.685
- No.

45:31.729 --> 45:33.252
- [Claudia] Uneasy or something.

45:33.295 --> 45:33.687
- No, no, no, none
of those things.

45:34.644 --> 45:35.515
Thank you for offering.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.344
I actually just
came in to tell you

45:38.387 --> 45:41.173
that we have a staff
meeting after school.

45:41.216 --> 45:44.089
- Oh, how nice of
you, thank you.

45:44.132 --> 45:46.482
- Yeah, it was nice
to meet you, A-cu-ru .

45:46.526 --> 45:48.136
- Likewise.
- Yeah.

46:12.944 --> 46:15.511
[phone ringing]

46:16.469 --> 46:17.513
- Hello?

46:18.514 --> 46:20.560
Hey Q, how are you doing?

46:20.603 --> 46:24.520
- Woman, don't ever answer
a man's phone, okay?

46:24.564 --> 46:25.478
- [Erica] Well I
guess I still have

46:25.521 --> 46:27.088
some learning to do then, huh?

46:27.132 --> 46:28.742
- Hey, I didn't mean to
start a fight over there.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.092
- Oh trust me, you're fine.

46:31.136 --> 46:32.833
Look, I'm not worried
about Anthony.

46:32.877 --> 46:35.662
See, he thinks he's
the one schooling me

46:35.705 --> 46:38.186
but I'm the one
that's teaching him.

46:38.230 --> 46:39.492
- Give me my phone.

46:39.535 --> 46:41.537
Give me my phone.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.452
What's up, Young King?

46:43.496 --> 46:45.498
Man, you know who's
running things around here.

46:45.541 --> 46:47.805
- Hey, I'm not in that door.

46:47.848 --> 46:49.894
But I do have something I
need to talk to you about.

46:49.937 --> 46:50.677
- [Anthony] What's up, man?

46:50.720 --> 46:51.896
Sounds serious.

46:51.939 --> 46:53.636
- Yeah, it is,
it's about Claudia.

46:53.680 --> 46:54.724
- Claudia?

46:55.638 --> 46:56.814
Hold on a second.

46:58.076 --> 46:59.555
Hey baby, I need to
take this real quick.

46:59.599 --> 47:03.081
- Okay, I'll let you two have
your little man time, alright?

47:03.124 --> 47:04.169
- Okay.

47:04.212 --> 47:05.344
- I'll see you in a little bit.

47:05.387 --> 47:06.258
- Alright, bye.

47:06.301 --> 47:07.737
Go on, girl.

47:07.781 --> 47:12.090
- [Erica] Boy, don't start
nothing you can't finish now.

47:13.569 --> 47:15.571
- What's up, man, what'd you do?

47:15.615 --> 47:17.443
Did she cut you yet?

47:17.486 --> 47:19.749
- No, but I'm afraid she
will if she finds out.

47:19.793 --> 47:21.273
- Finds out what?

47:22.404 --> 47:23.536
What did you do?

47:23.579 --> 47:25.668
- Nothing, nothing
out of the ordinary.

47:25.712 --> 47:27.670
Just had a photo
shoot the other day

47:27.714 --> 47:30.586
and it was a partially
nude photo shoot.

47:30.630 --> 47:34.460
- Okay, okay, so you
do those all the time.

47:34.503 --> 47:39.421
- I know, but the last one
was with Claudia's coworker

47:40.683 --> 47:43.556
and I saw her at Claudia's
job the other day.

47:44.949 --> 47:47.342
- Wow, did she say anything?

47:48.909 --> 47:51.607
- No, she acted like
she didn't even know me.

47:51.651 --> 47:54.697
- Okay, good, well I
suggest you do the same.

47:54.741 --> 47:57.352
There's no sense in you making
a big deal out of nothing.

47:57.396 --> 47:58.788
- [Q] Man, but what
if she finds out?

47:58.832 --> 48:00.268
- Man, she's not gonna find out

48:00.312 --> 48:02.401
'cause you're not
gonna say anything

48:02.444 --> 48:03.968
and I'm sure the
coworker's too embarrassed

48:04.011 --> 48:05.621
to say anything either.

48:05.665 --> 48:09.016
- I hope you're right bro,
I don't need anymore drama.

48:09.060 --> 48:10.670
- I hope I'm right too.

48:10.713 --> 48:13.934
I don't want to see you on
the five o'clock news, man.

48:13.978 --> 48:16.067
- Alright bro, I'll
talk to you later.

48:16.110 --> 48:18.504
- [Anthony] Peace.
- Alright.

48:41.266 --> 48:42.876
[sighing]

48:42.920 --> 48:45.531
- You never beat me.
- I know, right.

48:45.574 --> 48:47.054
Girl, Anthony has
me running with him

48:47.098 --> 48:49.752
at least three times a week now.

48:49.796 --> 48:51.232
- That explains it.

48:52.364 --> 48:55.236
So, how's everything
in paradise?

48:55.280 --> 48:57.456
- Actually things
are pretty good.

48:57.499 --> 48:59.675
Couldn't be any better.

48:59.719 --> 49:01.808
- You don't fight or argue?

49:01.851 --> 49:04.680
- Of course we do, but
it's never anything major.

49:04.724 --> 49:07.248
And plus, the sex is to die for.

49:09.076 --> 49:11.165
- Oh really?
- Yeah, buddy.

49:12.297 --> 49:13.646
How are you and Q?

49:16.866 --> 49:17.737
- We're okay.

49:18.651 --> 49:20.087
But we could be better.

49:20.131 --> 49:21.741
- Oh girl, all you need to do is

49:21.784 --> 49:24.135
throw on something sexy
and cook him a nice steak.

49:24.178 --> 49:27.790
- You always say that
and I always try it.

49:29.792 --> 49:31.229
And I'll try it again.

49:31.272 --> 49:33.753
- Thank you, now
practice makes perfect.

49:33.796 --> 49:36.799
Oh yeah, you know speaking of Q

49:36.843 --> 49:38.453
he did call Anthony
the other day.

49:38.497 --> 49:42.283
- Oh yeah, what are
they talking about?

49:42.327 --> 49:43.937
- That I'm not exactly too sure,

49:44.894 --> 49:46.809
but he did seem kind of nervous

49:46.853 --> 49:49.595
and he did mention your name.

49:49.638 --> 49:50.900
- It's probably nothing.

49:50.944 --> 49:52.728
You know, thanks spy.

49:52.772 --> 49:55.470
- You're welcome, girl,
you know I got your back.

49:55.514 --> 49:58.691
Now we could either
choose to sit here

49:58.734 --> 50:01.128
or we can continue our run.

50:01.172 --> 50:02.869
- Okay.
- Alright.

50:02.912 --> 50:06.699
Come on, girl, and try
to keep up this time.

50:09.006 --> 50:11.573
- Hey baby, what are
you doing up so early?

50:11.617 --> 50:12.792
You look nice.

50:12.835 --> 50:14.663
What are you watching?

50:14.707 --> 50:16.796
- Hey, it's a real
good movie on.

50:16.839 --> 50:19.668
It's about a psycho
foreign exchange student.

50:19.712 --> 50:21.061
- What's the name of it?

50:21.105 --> 50:23.672
- The Foreign Exchange Student.

50:23.716 --> 50:25.370
- Figures.

50:25.413 --> 50:28.764
Oh hey, don't forget I have
a photo shoot later on today

50:28.808 --> 50:31.028
at the house, okay?

50:31.071 --> 50:31.854

- Anything could happen.

52:29.885 --> 52:32.018

Look, if you want
this marriage to last

52:42.463 --> 52:45.814
we're gonna have to
get some counseling.

53:16.541 --> 53:19.848
some very important rough
patches in our marriage.

53:19.892 --> 53:21.372
- Okay, well in your own words

53:21.415 --> 53:23.374
can you tell me what you
guys are going through?

53:23.417 --> 53:26.507
- Um, she's having
some trust issues.

53:28.074 --> 53:31.469
She's uncomfortable with
the line of work that I do.

53:31.512 --> 53:32.948
- And may I ask, what
is your line of work?

53:32.992 --> 53:33.906
- [Claudia] He's a photographer.

53:33.949 --> 53:36.213
- Yeah, I'm a photographer.

53:37.431 --> 53:41.087
- His line of work makes
you a little uneasy?

53:44.090 --> 53:47.615
- It's very hard
and nerve wracking

53:47.659 --> 53:49.791
for me to be here right now.

you to be nervous, okay.

to be embarrassed.

Even the best marriages
sometimes need help.

- It's not that I have
a problem with him being

54:03.501 --> 54:03.936
a photographer necessarily.

54:05.154 --> 54:08.897
It's just that sometimes
he's taking pictures

54:08.941 --> 54:10.551
of beautiful women.

54:14.599 --> 54:15.643
- [Doctor] And those
beautiful women

54:15.687 --> 54:19.125
make you feel a little insecure?

54:19.168 --> 54:20.213
- Correct.

54:20.257 --> 54:23.172
Sometimes I get a
little insecure.

54:25.218 --> 54:27.873
- That's okay,
that's natural, okay.

54:27.916 --> 54:30.136
Everybody gets
insecure now and again.

Mr. Ala-way-a, how
does it make you feel

54:32.965 --> 54:34.967
to know that your wife is a
little insecure and uneasy

54:35.010 --> 54:36.795
about your profession?

- Please call me Q.
- Call you Q.

we're here right now.

Do you see a ring?

54:50.025 --> 54:51.244
- I told you where it was.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.986
- So you gonna hit on
her in front of me?

54:54.029 --> 54:56.336
- Trying to work things
out, he's not hitting on me.

54:56.380 --> 54:57.816

gotta go through?

54:57.859 --> 54:59.861

familiar with each other, okay?

I will call you Claudia,
I will call him Q.

55:03.212 --> 55:04.126
- Q, how does it make you feel?

55:04.170 --> 55:06.912
- I've tried to cater to her

55:06.955 --> 55:10.176
and not take those
jobs all the time

55:10.219 --> 55:14.702
but sometimes a job comes
up and I have to take it.

55:14.746 --> 55:16.225
- The next question
I'll ask you guys

55:16.269 --> 55:18.576
I need for you two to
be honest with me, okay?

55:18.619 --> 55:19.011
- [Q] Okay.

55:20.229 --> 55:21.666
- [Doctor] Has either
one of you stepped

55:21.709 --> 55:24.146
outside your marriage
and been unfaithful?

55:24.190 --> 55:25.713
I'm just asking this
because sometimes

55:25.757 --> 55:29.108
when somebody has cheated
it causes trust issues.

55:29.151 --> 55:32.590
- No, I would never,
ever cheat on my baby.

- Shit!

- Claudia?

55:46.125 --> 55:48.736
- I have never
cheated, I have Q.

55:50.303 --> 55:54.133
- Okay you two, that's enough
for today, we're building.

55:54.176 --> 55:57.354
Are you guys available at
the same time next week?

55:57.397 --> 55:59.268
- Yes, we are.

55:59.312 --> 56:01.183
- Good, then I'm gonna
give you homework.

56:01.227 --> 56:02.620
The first thing I need
for you guys to do

56:02.663 --> 56:04.752
is to go on a date.

56:04.796 --> 56:08.582
It's not about the expense,
just be thoughtful.

56:08.626 --> 56:11.193
And then I need for you
guys to make a list.

56:11.237 --> 56:13.631
A list of things that you
don't like about each other,

56:13.674 --> 56:15.763
things that need to change

56:15.807 --> 56:17.199
and put that list in an envelope

56:17.243 --> 56:18.592
and put it on the
counter at home.

56:18.636 --> 56:20.812
But you can not open
each other's list,

56:20.855 --> 56:23.467
that's a perfect
way to build trust.

56:23.510 --> 56:25.860

hard to do, right baby?

56:25.904 --> 56:27.427

seeing you next week.

you mean to tell me

the counselor gave
you homework, girl?

56:50.276 --> 56:53.410
- Yep, can't blame her though.

56:53.453 --> 56:55.368
- I guess you're right

56:55.412 --> 56:57.805
but you do need to
watch that temper, girl.

56:57.849 --> 56:59.372
- Yeah, I know.
- Mm-hmm.

56:59.416 --> 57:01.809

she was hitting on Q.

57:01.853 --> 57:04.725
- Uh-uh, look Claudia,
have you ever considered

57:04.769 --> 57:06.466
taking medication for that?

57:06.510 --> 57:07.554
- Medication?

57:08.512 --> 57:09.687
- Well not like that--

57:09.730 --> 57:11.166
- Good afternoon, ladies.

57:11.210 --> 57:14.996
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, sir.

57:15.040 --> 57:17.172
- You hear about
them two last year?

57:17.216 --> 57:18.783
- I couldn't help
but hear about it,

57:18.826 --> 57:20.741
she kept telling me
every chance she got.

57:20.785 --> 57:22.395
- Girl, what did she say?

57:22.439 --> 57:24.919
- About how he was doing it

57:24.963 --> 57:26.312
and he was doing it good.

- Yes?

57:31.056 --> 57:32.666
- Would you mind
helping Miss Chambers

57:32.710 --> 57:34.146
log back into her email?

57:34.189 --> 57:36.714
For some reason it
keeps logging her out.

57:36.757 --> 57:38.542
- I'll assist you right
after sixth period.

57:38.585 --> 57:40.195
We'll take care of it for you.

57:40.239 --> 57:42.023

if you need anything else.

57:42.067 --> 57:42.850
- Gotcha.

57:46.027 --> 57:48.900
- So why couldn't he help her?

57:48.943 --> 57:51.685
Why couldn't he help her?

57:51.729 --> 57:54.166
Obviously he must be helping
her out in other ways.

57:55.384 --> 57:58.257
- I don't think so, she
has a boyfriend now.

Caribbean beau getting along?

I can't complain.

58:12.314 --> 58:15.187
- Mm, you left early the other
day for his birthday, right?

58:15.230 --> 58:17.494
- Yeah, yeah, I left early.

58:18.973 --> 58:22.020
- So what did you
end up getting him?

58:23.369 --> 58:24.936
- Just a portrait.

58:26.198 --> 58:28.853
- Oh a portrait, was
the photographer a guy?

58:28.896 --> 58:30.724
- Uh no, she was a she.

58:30.768 --> 58:31.595
- Oh, okay.

58:32.596 --> 58:35.424
Am I going to see this portrait?

58:36.425 --> 58:39.733
- Well, it's a little private.

58:39.777 --> 58:42.780
- Huh, I bet you're
probably saying to yourself,

58:42.823 --> 58:45.043

58:45.086 --> 58:47.045
- No, nothing like that.

- Well okay, it's done,

to log in now.

- And this is your new
user name and password.

58:55.444 --> 58:56.881
- Okay.

58:56.924 --> 58:59.579
- Okay, so what
you want to do is

59:01.320 --> 59:02.713
if you need to
change the password

59:02.756 --> 59:05.367
you're gonna call the number
on the back of the computer

59:05.411 --> 59:07.108
and you're all set here.

59:07.152 --> 59:09.589
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

59:10.459 --> 59:12.244
There you go.

59:12.287 --> 59:14.202
- Yeah, I think I like this one.

quick, my wife is just here,

59:20.339 --> 59:21.993
- Oh nothing, just work baby.

59:22.036 --> 59:24.822
Actually I'm on an
important phone call.

59:24.865 --> 59:27.302
I'll go into the other room
and finish it up, okay?

59:27.346 --> 59:28.086
- Okay.

59:28.129 --> 59:30.044
[kissing]

59:30.088 --> 59:31.002
- Hello?

59:31.045 --> 59:33.482
Sorry about that, yeah, uh-huh.

01:00:28.189 --> 01:00:29.190
- Oh my God.

01:00:31.628 --> 01:00:32.933
Take your test.

01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:38.330
[phone beeping]

01:00:39.679 --> 01:00:40.549
- The hell?

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:42.943
Angela!

01:00:45.859 --> 01:00:47.469
- Yes sir, Mr. James?

01:00:47.513 --> 01:00:49.820
- Schedule an emergency
meeting today after school.

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.082
- Yes sir.

01:00:51.125 --> 01:00:53.693
- And do it now please.
- Yes sir.

01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:00.352
- No, no, no.

01:01:00.395 --> 01:01:01.875
- How did you get
that on your phone?

01:01:01.919 --> 01:01:03.094
- Everybody got the email.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.922
- Alright, settle down.

01:01:06.619 --> 01:01:08.055
I called this emergency meeting

01:01:08.099 --> 01:01:10.057
because there's some
inappropriate behavior

01:01:10.101 --> 01:01:12.364
going on at my
school, Mr. Brown.

01:01:12.407 --> 01:01:14.148
Mr. Brown, you need a moment?

01:01:14.192 --> 01:01:15.628
- I'm sorry, I didn't
mean all of that.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.326
- For those of you
who don't know,

01:01:18.370 --> 01:01:21.155
there are some inappropriate
photos of Miss Chambers

01:01:21.199 --> 01:01:22.722
floating around the school

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:25.638
and some of the
students have seen it.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.640
[chattering]

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:30.338
- So has this picture,
has it gone viral yet?

01:01:30.382 --> 01:01:31.688
- Not to my knowledge.

01:01:31.731 --> 01:01:33.341
The police left
about an hour ago.

01:01:33.385 --> 01:01:34.908
They're doing their own
investigation and so am I.

01:01:34.952 --> 01:01:37.389
- Do we know or have any idea

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:38.607
as to which student did this?

01:01:38.651 --> 01:01:40.653
- How do we know it's a student.

01:01:40.697 --> 01:01:44.048
- Surely you can't think
one of us did this, sir.

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:45.876
- I'm not ruling out
anyone or anything.

01:01:45.919 --> 01:01:48.443
I truly hope that no
one at this meeting

01:01:48.487 --> 01:01:50.228
has anything to do with this.

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.752
I want you to turn
in all work laptops

01:01:52.796 --> 01:01:55.102
with Secretary Davis
on your way out.

01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:57.104
We're gonna go
through everything.

01:01:57.148 --> 01:01:58.758
That'll be all.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:02.631
You guys have a good
day, see you tomorrow.

01:02:02.675 --> 01:02:04.459
Go get them laptops.

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:13.730
- Baby, you don't have to
do this right now, okay?

01:02:13.773 --> 01:02:15.427
I can come back tomorrow,

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:18.212
I can pick all this stuff
up for you, alright?

01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:20.475
- No it's okay, I
actually want to.

01:02:20.519 --> 01:02:22.913
- No baby, I need you to think.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:26.873
Do you know anybody that
would want to hurt you?

01:02:28.919 --> 01:02:30.877
- [Miss Chambers] Miss Franklin.

01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:33.967
- I'm sorry, the door was
open, I let myself in.

01:02:34.011 --> 01:02:37.971
Gosh, I heard about the
big mess that's going on

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:44.195
around campus, I'm
so sorry about that.

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:46.588
Are you okay?

01:02:46.632 --> 01:02:47.894
- I'm good, thank you.

01:02:47.938 --> 01:02:50.505
Miss Franklin, this
is my boyfriend Jacob

01:02:50.549 --> 01:02:53.508
and Jacob this is my
coworker Miss Franklin.

01:02:53.552 --> 01:02:55.336
- Nice to meet
you, Miss Franklin.

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.860
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:58.557 --> 01:02:59.645
- [Miss Chambers] So I
take it the meeting's over?

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:02.822
- Yeah, Principal
James is very upset.

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:06.521
To put it lightly.

01:03:07.696 --> 01:03:09.960
He's conducting a
huge investigation.

01:03:10.003 --> 01:03:12.484
He's gonna get to
the bottom of this.

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:14.573
Hey, it's gonna be alright.

01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:18.838
He collected all of the laptops

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:22.799
which by the way, you know I
personally work on all of them.

01:03:22.842 --> 01:03:25.279
I didn't detect any threat.

01:03:25.323 --> 01:03:26.411
No foul play.

01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:29.893
You're packing?

01:03:32.547 --> 01:03:34.680
Don't tell me you're
quitting, are you?

01:03:34.723 --> 01:03:36.943
- No, I'm definitely
not quitting.

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:41.905
I just want to take a few days
off, let things blow over.

01:03:43.428 --> 01:03:44.559
- Hopefully they understand,
I'd do the same thing.

01:03:44.603 --> 01:03:46.344
- You see, but what
I don't understand

01:03:46.387 --> 01:03:48.302
is how could someone
do something like this?

01:03:48.346 --> 01:03:52.698
Baby, do you know anybody
that would want to harm you?

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:57.050
- I don't know, I feel
like I get along great

01:03:57.094 --> 01:03:59.444
with everybody here at the job.

01:03:59.487 --> 01:04:03.100
- You do, you're nice
to all of the teachers.

01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:09.584
I don't think you have a
dishonest bone in your body.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:11.108
You're good to everyone.

01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:11.891
Even me.

01:04:23.424 --> 01:04:25.862
It was nice meeting you, Jacob.

01:04:38.265 --> 01:04:39.701
- That's your coworker?
- Yeah.

01:04:39.745 --> 01:04:40.920
- Is she always like that?

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.269
- I don't know.

01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:45.098
No.
- Baby, come on.

01:04:56.370 --> 01:04:58.764
- Hey Miss Chambers,
how are you?

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.548
- Not so good.

01:05:00.592 --> 01:05:01.636
- What's going on?

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.986
- Did you happen
to tell your wife

01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:04.726
about the photos that we took?

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.511
- [Q] No, of course not.

01:05:06.554 --> 01:05:07.904
- Okay well somebody
got a hold of them

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:09.644
and leaked them all
over the school.

01:05:09.688 --> 01:05:10.907
- [Q] What?

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:13.344
- Yeah, my students
saw those photos

01:05:13.387 --> 01:05:14.867
and I don't know if
I'm going to be able

01:05:15.824 --> 01:05:17.565
to look them in the eye again.

01:05:17.609 --> 01:05:18.827
- Well I can assure
you I didn't tell her.

01:05:18.871 --> 01:05:20.612
- [Miss Chambers] But it
was something she said.

01:05:20.655 --> 01:05:22.092
- What did she say?

01:05:24.224 --> 01:05:28.446
- She just spoke to me like
she may know something.

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:30.274
Does she have access
to your computer?

01:05:30.317 --> 01:05:31.101
- No.

01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:36.628
But I did leave my tablet
out the other night.

01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:38.804
Let me talk to her and
I'll call you back.

01:05:38.847 --> 01:05:39.848
- Okay, bye.

01:05:51.773 --> 01:05:54.254
- Hey babe, what's
wrong with you?

01:05:54.298 --> 01:05:56.300
[kissing]

01:05:57.779 --> 01:06:01.870
I'm about to go in the kitchen
and make you a sandwich.

01:06:01.914 --> 01:06:03.785
- Nothing's wrong,
just dead tired.

01:06:03.829 --> 01:06:05.483
I had a long photo shoot today.

01:06:05.526 --> 01:06:06.310
- Okay.

01:06:10.444 --> 01:06:11.532
- So how was your day?

01:06:11.576 --> 01:06:12.794
- Well, it was alright.

01:06:12.838 --> 01:06:15.667
But do you remember that teacher

01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.149
I introduced you to
when you brought me

01:06:19.192 --> 01:06:20.977
that really delicious
lunch, Miss Chambers?

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.804
- Yeah, what about her?

01:06:22.848 --> 01:06:25.633
- She took some really
sexy photos of herself

01:06:25.677 --> 01:06:29.420
and somehow they got
leaked all over the campus.

01:06:29.463 --> 01:06:30.682
- Wow, really?

01:06:32.249 --> 01:06:32.989
- Yeah.

01:06:34.903 --> 01:06:39.647
- [Q] So you do you know who
may have leaked these photos?

01:06:41.388 --> 01:06:42.172
- Nope.

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:45.784
I have no idea.

01:06:45.827 --> 01:06:48.439
- Are you sure about that?

01:06:48.482 --> 01:06:49.831
- Why do you care?

01:06:52.965 --> 01:06:54.749
Showing a lot of
emotions right now

01:06:54.793 --> 01:06:58.753
for someone who claims
he never met the woman.

01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:00.799
- She just seems
like a good person.

01:07:00.842 --> 01:07:03.802
- She just seems
like a good person.

01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:07.980
- So have you been on my tablet?

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:09.329
- Maybe I have.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:11.549
Maybe I haven't.

01:07:12.550 --> 01:07:13.768
- You better tell me right now!

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:14.813
[screaming]

01:07:14.856 --> 01:07:15.596
[slapping]

01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:16.771
- You fucker.

01:07:19.992 --> 01:07:23.082
- Baby, I'm sorry.
- Don't touch me.

01:07:23.126 --> 01:07:24.910
- I'm sorry, you okay?

01:07:28.131 --> 01:07:29.219
Are you okay?

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:33.701
- I'm sorry, it's my fault.

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:36.704
I'm always yapping.

01:07:38.619 --> 01:07:40.708
Just go take your shower.

01:07:43.798 --> 01:07:48.629
When you're done, I'll tell you
everything you want to know.

01:07:49.108 --> 01:07:49.674
- Okay.

01:07:58.552 --> 01:07:59.945
- Oh my God!

01:07:59.988 --> 01:08:02.600
My husband's been
trying to kill me.

01:08:02.643 --> 01:08:05.472
Hurry, I'm at 817 Summer Lane,

01:08:05.516 --> 01:08:07.344
please send someone fast.

01:08:07.387 --> 01:08:09.694
He's at the door right now.

01:08:27.189 --> 01:08:29.408
[punching]

01:08:29.453 --> 01:08:32.673
[heavy breathing]

01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:33.500
Shit.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:43.728
- One of those
domestic disturbances.

01:08:45.947 --> 01:08:47.862
You ready?
- I guess so.

01:08:55.087 --> 01:08:56.957
- Third eye turner
call this week.

01:08:57.002 --> 01:08:58.698
- What's up with these fuckers?

01:08:58.743 --> 01:08:59.917
- Shit, I don't know, man.

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:02.790
This dude give me shit
like that last dude,

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:05.837
I will not hesitate to
put two in his chest.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.273
You feel me?

01:09:07.317 --> 01:09:10.711
- Go in calm, whoop his ass
then put two in his chest.

01:09:10.755 --> 01:09:11.886
- Roger that.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:17.892
[knocking]

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.285
- Police, open up.

01:09:22.287 --> 01:09:23.898
Police, open up.

01:09:23.942 --> 01:09:26.988
Hey babe, the police
are at the door.

01:09:28.076 --> 01:09:29.077
The hell?

01:09:29.121 --> 01:09:30.688
Yes?
- [Cop] Are you Mr. Ala-way-a.

01:09:30.731 --> 01:09:31.819
- Yes, I am.

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:33.169
- Hands up.
- For what?

01:09:33.212 --> 01:09:34.300
- Hands up, turn around.

01:09:34.344 --> 01:09:35.127
- I didn't do anything!
- Turn around!

01:09:36.084 --> 01:09:36.823
- I ain't do nothing, man.

01:09:36.868 --> 01:09:37.782
- Walk forward.

01:09:37.825 --> 01:09:39.087
- Man, I didn't do nothing.

01:09:39.131 --> 01:09:39.783
- Place your fingers
behind your head.

01:09:39.827 --> 01:09:40.741
- For what?

01:09:40.785 --> 01:09:41.481
- I said interlace your fingers.

01:09:41.524 --> 01:09:42.743
Get down on your knees.

01:09:42.787 --> 01:09:43.743
- I ain't getting
down on nothing, man!

01:09:43.787 --> 01:09:45.006
- Get down on your knees!

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.835
- Man, I didn't do
anything, I'm telling you.

01:09:47.879 --> 01:09:49.446
- [Cop] You got him?
- Got him.

01:09:49.488 --> 01:09:50.663
- Mr. Ala-way-a, we are here

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:51.926
for a domestic disturbance call.

01:09:51.970 --> 01:09:53.276
- What?

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:54.494
- Is there anyone
else in the house?

01:09:54.538 --> 01:09:56.104
- Yeah, my wife,
she's in the bedroom.

01:09:56.148 --> 01:09:57.758
- Go check.
- [Cop] Roger.

01:09:57.802 --> 01:09:59.499
- Did you hit your
wife, Mr. Ala-way-a.

01:09:59.543 --> 01:10:00.892
- Hell no, man, I
didn't hit my wife.

01:10:00.935 --> 01:10:04.112
- [Cop] Good, that's
the right answer.

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:14.906
[sobbing]

01:10:17.169 --> 01:10:17.952
- Shit.

01:10:20.999 --> 01:10:22.218
This is Officer Morris.

01:10:22.261 --> 01:10:24.959
I need a bus at 817 Summer Lane,

01:10:25.003 --> 01:10:28.572

01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:40.192

Was this your husband,
Mr. Ala-way-a?

Worked her over
pretty good, huh?

01:11:18.448 --> 01:11:21.102
- Man, I didn't do that to her.

01:11:21.146 --> 01:11:22.713
All I did was just pushed
her against the wall,

01:11:22.756 --> 01:11:23.975
that's it man.

01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:24.758

you didn't touch her,

which one is it?

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.152
- Man, I--

01:11:27.195 --> 01:11:28.458

push her into a fucking wall.

01:11:28.501 --> 01:11:29.676
Alright, you like
hitting on women?

- [Cop] You think she's
a fucking punching bag?

- No man, I didn't
do that to her!

01:11:33.332 --> 01:11:34.812
- [Cop] Then who did?

01:11:34.855 --> 01:11:36.204

probably did it to herself.

Bro, why are you
calling me from jail?

- Man, it's Claudia,
she put me in here.

01:12:01.578 --> 01:12:04.972
She lied to the cops and
told them that I hit her.

01:12:05.016 --> 01:12:06.452
- Well did you hit the bitch?

01:12:06.496 --> 01:12:09.281
- No man, I just shoved her
against the wall, that's it.

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:10.587
You know I wouldn't hit her.

01:12:10.630 --> 01:12:12.545

about that chick.

come bail you out?

I'm on my way right now.

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:21.032

bail in a couple of days.

01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:22.163
I'm gonna stay here until then.

to head over there

- No, hey dude, don't do that.

01:12:26.254 --> 01:12:28.126
She might throw herself
against the wall or something

01:12:28.169 --> 01:12:29.562
and say that you did it.

01:12:29.606 --> 01:12:30.868
I don't trust her.

01:12:30.911 --> 01:12:33.566

as soon as you get out.

For a very long

would do this to you.

you anywhere near me.

you he came by last night?

Anthony not to talk to you.
