WEBVTT

00:01.293 --> 00:02.960
We have
multiple victims.

00:03.128 --> 00:04.087
I got one!

00:04.254 --> 00:05.630
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:05.798 --> 00:07.131
I just heard from
the state's attorney.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.341
Voight's out.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.469
He was promoted to Sergeant,
and he's running the
Intelligence Unit.

00:11.637 --> 00:13.471
You're in
the Intelligence Unit.
Don't I know it.

00:13.639 --> 00:14.639
There's been
a lot of bad blood

00:14.807 --> 00:16.974
between cops and firemen
in this district.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.644
I want to be the first
to put it all behind us.

00:19.812 --> 00:21.479
What are your names?

00:21.647 --> 00:23.356
Barnes.
Sermons.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.191
Hey, listen, Shay!
I'm sorry.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.236
A baby isn't
an afterthought, Kelly.
I know that.

00:28.404 --> 00:30.905
I still haven't come
clean with him about
Boden and his mom.

00:31.073 --> 00:33.574
And it just feels
like this dark cloud
hanging over us.

00:33.742 --> 00:34.867
You knew about
this how long?

00:35.035 --> 00:36.369
I know I should've
told you sooner,

00:36.537 --> 00:37.704
but you have to see it
from my point-of-view.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.706
Do I? Is that what
I need to do, Dawson?

00:39.873 --> 00:42.458
That's weird.
Oh, yeah. I know about this.
I'll take care of it.

00:42.626 --> 00:43.876
Okay.
Everything good?

00:45.671 --> 00:47.463
- That's Hallie's clinic.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.883
Come on! Breathe!

00:56.849 --> 00:59.642
We were scheduled to open
our bar after next shift

01:00.936 --> 01:03.396
and in light
of what happened,

01:03.564 --> 01:04.856
we were
going to push it,

01:06.358 --> 01:07.859
but...

01:08.986 --> 01:11.320
Me and Dawson
and Otis,

01:12.239 --> 01:14.949
we talked about it,
and instead

01:16.493 --> 01:19.078
we're going to
make it a celebration
of Hallie's life.

01:22.124 --> 01:26.461
All the proceeds for the night
will be donated in her name
to Children's Memorial.

01:29.047 --> 01:30.381
Thanks.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.602
Not an easy day.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.772
Not for any of us.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.110
Lieutenant Casey
is meeting with
detectives from CPD.

01:53.155 --> 01:55.698
Arson investigators are
at the clinic right now.

01:58.911 --> 02:01.621
All we can do
for Matt is be there
the best we can.

02:18.514 --> 02:19.889
Hey.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.767
Lieutenant Casey.
I'm here to see
Detective Dawson.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.353
We got a fireman
in the house!

02:25.521 --> 02:27.522
Look at him,
well rested and fed.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.148
Must be nice
being a fireman.

02:29.316 --> 02:30.942
Wash the fire truck
and the dog...
Sarge. Sarge!

02:32.444 --> 02:33.778
The DOA from
the clinic fire.

02:33.946 --> 02:35.696
Lieutenant Casey
was her boyfriend.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.615
Oh...

02:37.783 --> 02:38.783
My bad.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.995
Detective Julie Willhite.
Intelligence.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.997
I'll take
you upstairs.
Yeah.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.296
Two guys we flipped
and scrips all over.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.384
I'm so sorry, man.

02:56.552 --> 02:57.593
Thanks.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.722
So where we at?

03:02.766 --> 03:04.559
I just got
off the phone...
I don't deal with you.

03:04.726 --> 03:06.018
I deal with Antonio.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.651
ME report came in.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.237
Hallie was struck
in the back of
the head and killed

03:16.405 --> 03:17.905
before the fire started.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.127
Units in 21, foot man
on Taylor Street

03:31.295 --> 03:33.421
just confirmed sighting
of your silver Magnum.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.006
1400 block of West Taylor.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.550
That's the car
that fled the clinic fire.

03:37.718 --> 03:41.262
This is 2121.
Silver Magnum has been
located going east on Taylor.

03:42.472 --> 03:43.890
We're not
on Taylor.
I know.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.696
Blocked on Racine!
They bailed out!
We're in pursuit!

04:39.071 --> 04:40.363
Seriously?

04:56.088 --> 04:57.546
Stay down!

05:03.470 --> 05:05.012
Oh, please.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.896
You good?

05:22.489 --> 05:25.241
What have we got?
A couple
of Oxyheads.

05:25.409 --> 05:28.786
Handful of priors
for armed robbery,
mostly around UIC.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.663
They're saying they knew
the car was hot,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.707
but they bought it
from a black male
for 500

05:32.874 --> 05:36.210
and were going to use it for
a couple of days to do some
stickups and then dump it.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.965
He resisted.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.758
She kicked me
in the balls!

05:42.926 --> 05:44.427
Cry me a river.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.637
They're denying any
involvement in the clinic.

05:46.805 --> 05:49.432
There's no arson
or bodily harm in
either of their records.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.892
Who's the brains
of the outfit?

05:52.060 --> 05:53.185
That guy.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.770
Bring him over here.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.693
Who'd you buy
the car from?

06:00.861 --> 06:03.696
Black dude
named Shorty.
Oh, Shorty.

06:04.781 --> 06:05.823
Shorty.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.201
- Get him out of here.
- Come on.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.883
Looks like a lot of cars
we'd find in Narcotics.

06:24.801 --> 06:26.886
Generic,
dummy plates.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.891
A lot of them have traps
built in to move
the dope and cash.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.479
Okay.

06:50.744 --> 06:51.911
There we go.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.004
So what does this mean?
Who are you looking for?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.924
Someone who was
moving major dope.

07:18.522 --> 07:20.481
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.774
Um...

07:21.942 --> 07:24.193
On the heels of all this,
I was thinking that,

07:24.361 --> 07:27.571
you know, God forbid
something were to happen
to either one of us,

07:27.739 --> 07:30.783
that maybe we should have
something written up,
legally, in terms of

07:30.951 --> 07:32.785
who would take care
of the baby.
Absolutely.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.995
And speaking of,
we go in tomorrow.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.790
Casey's heading back
down to the fire scene
with the detectives.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.375
I'm coming.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.544
And I'll...

07:42.963 --> 07:44.505
I'll be there.

07:45.674 --> 07:46.966
Yeah.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.971
That's so nice of you.
Thank you.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.722
Bye.

07:53.890 --> 07:56.725
The optical shop on the corner
is going to donate a couple
pairs of sunglasses

07:56.893 --> 07:58.602
to raffle off.
Great.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.772
As soon as Zoya starts,
she can help go
collect all this stuff.

08:01.940 --> 08:05.276
Who?
Uh, my cousin
from Russia, Zoya.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.195
We talked
about this.
When?

08:08.363 --> 08:09.405
At the soft opening.

08:09.573 --> 08:12.908
What, when I got, like,
six beers in me?
Hey, you signed off, dude.

08:14.202 --> 08:17.079
Do you know
anything about this?
First I've heard of it.

08:17.247 --> 08:19.748
Okay, she's here on a
6-month work visa,

08:19.916 --> 08:22.168
but apparently the
nanny job is killing her.

08:22.335 --> 08:26.755
She's nice, she's cute, she's
got restaurant experience,
and you agreed to it.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.592
What kind of restaurant?
Who cares?
It's fine. She's in.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.468
We got funds
to raise.

08:31.636 --> 08:34.263
- You guys are killing me.
- Aw, you'll love her.

08:38.935 --> 08:40.644
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.610
How you holding up?

08:51.448 --> 08:52.656
Best I can.

08:56.036 --> 09:00.581
There's no security video.
Two of the cameras are fake
and the other had no database.

09:00.749 --> 09:03.667
Arson is saying
it doesn't look
like a break-in.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.670
Same director
of this clinic runs
another over on Wabash.

09:07.631 --> 09:09.965
Let's take a look.
Thanks, Chief.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.018
This is
the ignition point.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.562
Patient prescription records.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.692
Actually...

09:29.694 --> 09:31.028
Hallie,

09:32.405 --> 09:35.532
right before we went to lunch,
she was standing there
looking at something,

09:35.700 --> 09:37.701
and she said,
"That's weird."

09:37.869 --> 09:40.537
I just figured
it was about billing
or something.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.831
Main to Battalion 25,
Truck 81,

09:42.999 --> 09:44.583
Squad Three
and Ambulance 61...

09:44.751 --> 09:46.543
No, no, no.
Responding to a
civilian in distress.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.712
Your head's not in
the game right now.

09:48.880 --> 09:51.048
I'll cover for you.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.633
He can roll with us.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.595
- Battalion 25. En route.
- Copy that.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.392
Not a problem.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.941
I swear I heard
screaming down there.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.741
Help!

10:18.743 --> 10:19.994
Get your lights!

10:20.829 --> 10:21.870
Here!

10:22.038 --> 10:23.539
The voice came
from over there.
Watch yourself.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.416
Water's moving fast.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.167
Chief, down there!

10:28.003 --> 10:29.837
I don't think
I can hold on much longer!

10:30.005 --> 10:31.255
Hang on!
We're going to get you out!

10:31.423 --> 10:33.632
Get your webbing,
secure it to this rail.

10:35.719 --> 10:37.761
- I'll hold the line.
- Don't let go!

10:39.431 --> 10:41.765
Careful,
watch that current.
I got you.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.810
- I can't move!
- Talk to me, Kelly!

10:44.978 --> 10:48.605
Chief, both her feet
are sucked into a drain.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.607
We've got one
victim pinned in.

10:50.775 --> 10:54.611
I need rescue rope and scuba
gear in the west end of the
tunnel right now.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.822
Coming in!
Something's
cutting my leg!

10:57.907 --> 11:01.201
Chief! Suction's trapping
debris at her feet.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.749
I've got her.
I've got to dive down,
get you clear.

11:10.337 --> 11:14.840
Please! Please don't
let me die down here.
I've got you!

11:16.634 --> 11:17.843
Come on!

11:22.599 --> 11:24.808
They're over here!

11:24.976 --> 11:26.685
I got some of it cleared,
but I need more time.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.479
We don't have it.
Severide!

11:28.646 --> 11:31.065
We need the scuba
gear over here!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.275
I got it! Get my mask!

11:34.652 --> 11:37.821
I'm going to put this mask
over your face. It will help
you breathe underwater.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.952
Just hold still!
Got air?

11:44.120 --> 11:46.789
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
She's going under!
I can't see her!

11:46.956 --> 11:48.582
- You got her, Chief?
- I got her. I got her.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.167
The water
level's rising.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.335
Hey, hey!

11:51.503 --> 11:54.838
I got the debris clear but
the suction's keeping her
down. We need to pull her up.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.882
Get the rope down there!
Get the rope
under her arm.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.760
I need more light!
Severide!
Feed that under her arm!

11:59.928 --> 12:03.222
Watch her mask.
I got her, Chief. Ready? Go.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.224
- Hold on.
- Grab the webbing.

12:05.392 --> 12:08.519
- Hang on!
- Ready? One, two, pull!

12:08.686 --> 12:10.646
Watch her head!

12:14.651 --> 12:16.318
Capp, grab her legs!
We got her!

12:16.486 --> 12:17.986
- Watch the tank!
- I got it, Chief!

12:20.698 --> 12:24.535
You okay, kid? Look at me.
Sucking in that river, huh?

12:25.703 --> 12:27.538
Okay, we got
you, girl.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.123
Let's go.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.084
- Good, Chief?
- We're good!

12:33.711 --> 12:35.129
Nice work!

12:35.296 --> 12:37.548
Good job.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.967
Let's get the hell
out of here.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.224
Do you recognize
either one?
Never seen them before.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.105
Any problems with
anyone at the clinic?

12:53.273 --> 12:57.568
Not with our employees.
Everybody works and
volunteers are here because

12:57.735 --> 13:00.154
they care, they want
to give back.

13:00.321 --> 13:02.114
Patients?

13:02.282 --> 13:04.741
Let's just say a few
bad apples have walked
through that door.

13:06.536 --> 13:09.121
Anyone specifically?
Who might
kill Hallie?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.500
I don't know.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.587
Two of the security
cameras were fake.

13:16.754 --> 13:20.674
I'm just trying to keep
the doors open, you know?

13:20.842 --> 13:23.469
And there's a lot
of things I can't afford
that I'd like to.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.222
Fire was started
near the prescription
records.

13:27.390 --> 13:30.350
Our guess?
Someone tried to cover
up some impropriety.

13:30.518 --> 13:32.644
Those scrips are for a
hell of a lot of oxycontin.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.938
For you, maybe.
Not for someone in pain.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.611
Any problems with
your prescription drugs?

13:40.778 --> 13:42.613
Any missing inventory?
Not that I know of.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.449
We have a drug cage,
and there's never
been a problem.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.202
Mr. Gooding,
we're going to need a list
of employees, patients...

13:48.369 --> 13:50.370
And I'm going to have
to stop you right there.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.040
We are dealing
with protected
health information,

13:53.208 --> 13:56.627
potential HIPAA violations,
insurance liabilities,
blah, blah, blah.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.546
It's going
to have to go through
our legal department.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.638
If your clinic
was a pill mill,

14:07.805 --> 14:09.389
and Hallie found out about it,

14:09.557 --> 14:11.642
and someone killed her
to shut her up,

14:11.809 --> 14:15.479
now, right now,
would be the time
to tell us.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.860
It's not a pill mill.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.285
Okay, look, um...

14:31.412 --> 14:33.830
There's this guy,
Jubal Bartlett.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.626
He was a drug dealer.
His girlfriend came
in with a broken jaw.

14:37.794 --> 14:40.921
We reported it to the police.
He did not take it kindly.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.174
He made threats.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.812
We'll be back.

15:00.066 --> 15:03.151
So, Zoya, this is
Herrmann and Dawson.
Nice to meet you.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.529
Guys, this is Zoya.
Hey, so nice
to meet you.

15:05.697 --> 15:06.905
Hello.

15:07.073 --> 15:10.576
So, Brian said
that you've got some
restaurant experience?

15:10.743 --> 15:11.743
Thank you!

15:17.709 --> 15:18.834
Um...

15:27.969 --> 15:32.848
Anyway, just wanted to make
some quick introductions
and we'll see you at the bar.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.728
We got Yakov Smirnoff
tending bar now?

15:37.895 --> 15:39.187
Who's that?

15:43.693 --> 15:46.737
Um, so, for the opening
and the benefit,

15:46.904 --> 15:49.448
I'm pretty sure she
said she's going to
bring a monkey.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.409
A monkey?
Yep.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.204
Otis.
Look, it's probably some
sort of good luck gesture or,

15:56.372 --> 15:58.123
or, you know, has some sort
of cultural significance.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.458
What's the worst
that could happen?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.752
Did you see the lady on
Oprah who got her face
chewed off by a monkey?

16:01.919 --> 16:03.295
I did see that,

16:04.130 --> 16:05.964
and if it looks
like it could take us,

16:06.132 --> 16:07.382
I'll tell her to
keep it in the car.

16:12.555 --> 16:15.349
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

16:17.935 --> 16:20.812
I've got
the word out to all
my Cls. Nothing yet.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.774
And none of the neighbors
saw or heard anything
prior to the fire.

16:23.941 --> 16:26.693
Subpoena will get us
employee and patient
records in a couple hours.

16:26.861 --> 16:29.780
What about the drug dealer the
clinic director put us onto?

16:29.947 --> 16:31.490
Can't find him.
Can't find him?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.534
Ran him through NCIC
and the FBI to see if he
got pinched anywhere else.

16:34.702 --> 16:35.952
What's this
drug dealer's name?

16:40.208 --> 16:45.962
Yeah, it's probably best we
don't tell you. We don't want
you doing something rash.

16:47.965 --> 16:53.261
I understand that you
and Hallie broke up before
her death. Is that right?

16:53.429 --> 16:56.181
For a few months, yeah.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.517
She see anyone
in that gap?

16:58.685 --> 16:59.810
No one serious.

16:59.977 --> 17:04.815
Did she ever mention anyone
that she felt uncomfortable
around, was afraid of?

17:04.982 --> 17:06.233
Yeah.

17:07.110 --> 17:08.151
You.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.616
Lieutenant, I'm sympathetic
to what you're going through.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.661
I don't believe that
for a second.
Fine.

17:17.829 --> 17:18.829
Don't.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.834
But I've allowed you
to be here as a courtesy.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.878
Courtesy? From you?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.046
I don't need it.

17:30.133 --> 17:33.635
I want you to find out
who killed my girl!
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

17:33.803 --> 17:35.053
All right?

17:39.267 --> 17:40.434
You've got to
chill out, bro.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.061
Voight isn't going to lift
a finger unless someone
pays him under the table.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.105
I got my eye on him.
Okay?

17:45.273 --> 17:46.940
He's working
the case.

17:47.108 --> 17:48.650
Go back to the firehouse.
Cool off.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.278
No. I'm staying here.
You're not.

17:51.446 --> 17:52.571
Wait to hear from me.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.282
Go on.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.625
Okay, there's what would
happen if both of us died.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.670
Who would take care
of the baby?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.089
Yeah, we should
figure that out.
Dawson, right?

18:12.300 --> 18:13.842
Yeah.
Okay.

18:17.930 --> 18:21.141
What is it?
I'm just excited!

18:21.309 --> 18:22.601
Me, too.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.400
But then part of me feels
horrible because of what
Casey's going through.

18:30.568 --> 18:32.027
Here I am with butterflies
in my stomach

18:32.195 --> 18:33.862
because I'm getting
ready to go get pregnant...

18:38.868 --> 18:40.869
Ambulance 61.
Gunshot victim.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.293
Neighbors reported
shots fired.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.006
Thirty-year-old female,
single gunshot
to the stomach.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.509
Actually, that's a guess.
It's hard to tell.
There's a lot of blood.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.552
She was pumping out
pretty good.
I applied pressure,

18:57.720 --> 18:59.721
but I don't know
what's going on.
It's okay. I got it.

19:10.983 --> 19:11.983
I'm not feeling anything.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.034
She's gone.
I'm calling it.

19:21.202 --> 19:22.828
61 to Main,
victim is DOA.

19:22.995 --> 19:25.705
We're delayed on scene
while we document for CPD.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.082
Dawson.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.502
She was a nurse at the
clinic Hallie worked at.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
Hey.

19:45.852 --> 19:46.768
What the hell
is going on?

19:46.936 --> 19:48.478
That's what we're
trying to find out.

19:49.939 --> 19:51.940
- How's he been?
- Busy.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.359
Like everybody
on this case.
I'll get at you later.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.072
Boo.

20:04.120 --> 20:05.704
In on it?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.747
Or she found out
who was.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.708
Neighbor only heard
the gunshot.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.501
No one on either
side saw anyone leave,

20:11.669 --> 20:14.045
but we can keep
knocking on doors.
Willhite.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.049
Do that.
Yes, sir.

20:20.803 --> 20:22.554
The drug dealer?
Jubal Bartlett?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.431
He's been locked up
in Virginia Beach
for the past four days

20:24.599 --> 20:25.724
on a possession charge.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.727
I want that clinic director
in the hot seat. Now.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.645
I told his lawyer
I was going to issue
an arrest warrant

20:30.813 --> 20:31.980
for obstruction
by the end of the week

20:32.148 --> 20:33.607
if he didn't get his client
to honor the meet.

20:33.774 --> 20:36.735
Man, whoever did these two
hits is going to be long gone
by the end of the week.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.446
This ain't
the gang unit, Voight.

20:39.614 --> 20:42.449
Sarge. You can't do
everything with
a battering ram.

20:43.367 --> 20:44.743
The hell I can't.

20:47.914 --> 20:51.124
Don't worry,
I got him handled.
I noticed.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.046
Oh, my God.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.256
What?
I just took this
baby-proofing quiz.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.925
We live in a death trap.

21:00.092 --> 21:03.762
Spiral stair case,
upper floor apartment
with accessible balconies.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.181
I mean...
Are you giving
birth tomorrow?

21:06.349 --> 21:08.600
Listen, we have time
to make any fixes we need.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.644
We need a locked
liquor cabinet.
Remind me.

21:10.811 --> 21:12.437
Okay.

21:12.605 --> 21:13.939
Leslie Shay?

21:14.941 --> 21:17.150
Hi. Here we go.

21:20.947 --> 21:24.699
God, will you rub my
belly for good luck?
Just...

21:24.867 --> 21:26.952
Relax.
All right.

21:29.997 --> 21:31.790
Ready?
Yeah, feeling fertile.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.959
Okay! We'll make
sure of that. Okay.

21:36.587 --> 21:38.254
A monkey?
Why is everybody
acting like

21:38.422 --> 21:39.923
she said she's going
to bring a unicorn?

21:40.091 --> 21:41.800
Yes. A monkey.
Why?

21:41.968 --> 21:44.386
Ask her when
she gets here.
Ask Otis to ask her.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.764
She doesn't
speak English.
Oh! It's serviceable.

21:49.767 --> 21:50.892
Got to go White Sox.

21:51.060 --> 21:54.980
No. I don't want to alienate
half the neighborhood
who're Cubs fans.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.775
We got to go with teams
we can all agree on,
the Bears, the Bulls

21:58.943 --> 22:00.735
and Blackhawks.
And The Fire.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.698
The who?
Soccer team.
Chicago Fire.

22:05.616 --> 22:08.827
Who knew?
Okay. Sure, fine.
Get a banner.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.090
Hey. Thanks for coming.

22:22.258 --> 22:24.300
Of course.

22:24.468 --> 22:25.677
Um...

22:28.014 --> 22:30.015
I've been thinking about
everything, you know?

22:31.225 --> 22:33.601
And waiting for this...

22:36.355 --> 22:38.231
This anger to go away.

22:40.985 --> 22:41.985
And it's not.

22:43.404 --> 22:45.405
And I'm not mad at you.

22:46.490 --> 22:49.409
But I do have to say
I wish you would have
told me when you found out.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.036
I know you do.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.664
All I can say is
I just felt stuck

22:54.832 --> 22:57.042
because I didn't
want to hurt you and...

22:57.918 --> 23:01.254
And it wasn't my business.
But it was your business.
I was your boyfriend.

23:03.424 --> 23:04.466
Was?

23:16.145 --> 23:17.896
I think I need some time.

23:19.982 --> 23:23.526
Look, I respect you
too much to have you
twisting in the wind,

23:23.694 --> 23:25.111
wondering where
my head's at.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.123
Oh, man.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.920
I mean...

23:44.924 --> 23:46.758
I knew this was
a possibility if
I told you. But...

23:46.926 --> 23:48.009
I still love you,

23:49.470 --> 23:50.762
I do.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.431
But this whole thing...

23:57.186 --> 23:59.562
I guess it's just

23:59.730 --> 24:01.815
a little deeper
than I thought.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.859
Well, you need
to figure it out, Pete.

24:05.027 --> 24:06.945
One way
or another.
I know.

24:12.118 --> 24:13.660
I've got to go.

24:28.008 --> 24:30.718
Uh-oh. Voight's here!
Everybody, hide your wallets!

24:30.886 --> 24:33.805
Hey, what's up, Pruitt?
There it is.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.266
You've got to be
the luckiest son
of a bitch I ever met.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.810
How do you walk around
all day with that
horseshoe in your ass?

24:38.978 --> 24:41.020
Just living
the dream.
I guess you are.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.774
Anything from your
man in narcotics?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.317
Nothing yet, man.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.819
They set a bunch of
controlled buys up,

24:47.987 --> 24:49.946
but nothing, man,
not even a vitamin.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.031
Cls had nothing either.
I don't know what
to tell you...

24:52.199 --> 24:53.825
Hmm.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.827
Prints came back
on that Magnum.

24:55.995 --> 24:57.996
Calvin Jackson.
Goes by C.J.

24:58.164 --> 25:00.123
Extensive sheet
for dealing,
including oxy.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.750
We're heading over
to grab him up.
No, no.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.378
I'll take care of it.
Great work.

25:20.978 --> 25:22.687
I heard that.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.232
Yeah, you know it.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.402
Oh, look at this.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.862
What's up, bro?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.739
I knew they couldn't
keep you down.

25:32.907 --> 25:34.949
Hey, man, not
in this lifetime.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.917
We got a little
problem with
your nephew, C.J.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.753
We got his prints
on a car that booked it

25:46.921 --> 25:49.005
from that clinic fire
a few days back.

25:49.924 --> 25:51.382
Was he involved?

25:52.301 --> 25:55.470
What if he was?
I don't like
guessing games.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.683
He was buying prescrips
from some dude

26:00.851 --> 26:04.479
who was working with
a nurse inside and the
guy who ran the clinic.

26:04.647 --> 26:07.148
Next thing I know,
C.J. Comes back
all tweaked.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.152
He was at the clinic
doing a pickup

26:11.320 --> 26:14.113
when the place
caught fire.
So he bounced.

26:14.281 --> 26:18.868
The name of the dude?
C.J. Didn't say
and I didn't ask.

26:19.036 --> 26:22.664
He did say that this guy
ain't right in the head.

26:22.831 --> 26:25.541
Like white boy
serial killer crazy.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.585
Second thing,

26:27.753 --> 26:29.337
he knows about me

26:29.505 --> 26:30.713
and you.

26:31.966 --> 26:34.050
And how would my
name come up, Mo?

26:35.094 --> 26:37.553
C.J. Told him you
gave us protection.

26:38.973 --> 26:42.350
So, if you lock him
up and he starts
running his trap,

26:43.894 --> 26:46.980
that ain't good
for any of us.
Know what I'm saying?

26:48.607 --> 26:51.567
You get C.J. On
the phone and get me
the name of that guy.

26:51.735 --> 26:55.446
No, C.J.'s gone.
I told him to dump his
phone and clear out

26:55.614 --> 26:59.534
for a bit.
You know how I work.
This is your problem now.

27:04.331 --> 27:07.709
Five stacks.
A little welcome
back gift.

27:25.185 --> 27:31.107
So you can start
the college fund when,
um, the baby's born.

27:31.275 --> 27:34.360
And it's only like
five dollars a month.

27:34.528 --> 27:37.363
Even if they don't
go to college, they
still get the money.

27:37.531 --> 27:40.742
So I'm not quite sure
why they call it a
college fund. It's...

27:40.909 --> 27:43.870
Really, it's just a fund
for when they turn 18.

27:44.038 --> 27:45.163
So...

27:47.750 --> 27:49.042
Are you okay?

27:54.381 --> 27:56.090
Mills broke up with me.

27:57.051 --> 27:59.469
Oh, my God.
Over the Boden thing?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.180
Yeah.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.018
What an idiot.
I'm sorry, sweetie.

28:43.305 --> 28:45.681
I was going to
call them, but

28:45.849 --> 28:48.059
then it felt like
that was the easy
way out.

28:48.227 --> 28:49.811
So I drove over.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.106
And her parents were
having a dinner party.

28:54.525 --> 28:59.070
Hallie's sister was there,
her kids, her parents
friends, all of them.

29:02.366 --> 29:04.075
That was the hardest
thing I've ever
done in my life.

29:07.871 --> 29:09.789
I'm so sorry, Matt.

29:15.337 --> 29:17.088
Hey, I appreciate this.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.217
I needed it.

29:27.850 --> 29:29.350
You know, when Andy died,

29:33.856 --> 29:38.609
without even realizing it,
I found myself needing to be
around people acting normal,

29:39.528 --> 29:41.863
just to get my frame
of reference back,

29:42.030 --> 29:43.990
pull myself out of
the hole I was in.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.870
So whenever
you want to

29:49.872 --> 29:52.874
grab a smoke or hit
golf balls or whatever.

29:58.380 --> 30:02.175
Casey? Antonio and
Detective Willhite
are here for you.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.894
We're waiting on
the nurse's cell
phone records,

30:13.061 --> 30:14.520
fingerprints
from her apartment.

30:14.688 --> 30:17.607
But we're not Homicide,
so we can be a little
more aggressive.

30:17.774 --> 30:19.066
Good.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.485
We cooked up something.

30:22.404 --> 30:23.738
You'd go in to
the clinic director.

30:23.906 --> 30:25.656
He knows you were
Hallie's boyfriend, right?

30:25.824 --> 30:27.200
Right.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.743
You tell him you
were going through
her computer at home

30:28.911 --> 30:30.036
and she spelled out
the whole thing.

30:31.288 --> 30:34.457
She also mentioned the
director was a good guy and
probably was forced into this.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.125
And after that you
don't say a word,

30:36.293 --> 30:37.460
because he'll either
take the bait

30:37.628 --> 30:39.462
and give us the name
of his accomplice,
or he won't.

30:40.923 --> 30:42.673
We'll be outside.
So if anything
goes sideways,

30:42.841 --> 30:43.841
we're right there.

30:46.803 --> 30:48.095
He'll be wearing a wire?

30:48.263 --> 30:49.597
That's right.

30:49.765 --> 30:52.350
And how do we know this
director isn't the trigger
man and he pulls a gun?

30:54.102 --> 30:57.271
We wouldn't be here
if we thought that
was a valid scenario,

30:57.439 --> 30:59.190
but can we guarantee
your safety 100%?

30:59.358 --> 31:00.358
No.

31:05.906 --> 31:07.949
I don't care. I'm in.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.427
All right,
here we go.

31:28.595 --> 31:29.971
He's walking
into the clinic.

31:32.975 --> 31:35.101
This is Sermons.
We're tucked away
and standing by.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.530
Prints came back
from the nurse's
apartment.

31:49.074 --> 31:52.410
Timothy Campbell. Whoa.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.704
What?
Armed robbery,
drug possession,

31:54.871 --> 31:56.122
assault with
a deadly weapon.

32:01.003 --> 32:02.253
How you doing?

32:02.421 --> 32:03.838
I'd like to talk
to Steve Gooding?

32:04.006 --> 32:05.298
He's in a meeting.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.217
Do you know
when he'll be out?

32:08.385 --> 32:09.677
I don't.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.183
Do you mind if I wait
until he's done?

32:19.813 --> 32:21.022
Go!

32:34.536 --> 32:36.245
Police! Get down! Move!

32:54.056 --> 32:55.056
Casey!

33:02.606 --> 33:04.523
Casey!

33:09.446 --> 33:10.905
Casey!

33:13.408 --> 33:15.201
El platform!

33:29.216 --> 33:32.134
Police! Get down!
Get down! Police!

33:35.097 --> 33:36.764
Police! Get down!

33:36.932 --> 33:39.225
Casey! Casey!

33:47.150 --> 33:48.359
Clear right!

34:20.475 --> 34:21.559
Stay with it!
Stay with it!

34:59.681 --> 35:00.765
Freeze!

35:01.683 --> 35:03.601
Let him go and
drop the gun,
Campbell!

35:03.769 --> 35:05.770
I swear to God
I'll blow his
head off.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.612
Let him go.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.822
Put the gun on the ground.
That ain't happening.

35:16.990 --> 35:19.158
Put it on the ground!
I'm not dropping my gun!

35:20.786 --> 35:22.620
Here, look.

35:22.788 --> 35:23.788
Okay?

35:24.790 --> 35:26.332
Now you've got to do
the same for me.

35:29.419 --> 35:31.170
Voight.
Wait, you're Voight?

35:33.590 --> 35:34.840
Thank God.
Tell them...

35:49.356 --> 35:51.941
King 80, 4-10, emergency.

35:52.108 --> 35:54.276
King 80, 4-10,
go with your emergency.

35:54.444 --> 35:55.611
Shot fired by the police.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.656
Roll an ambulance
to the El platform on
Kinsey and Wells.

35:58.824 --> 36:01.659
Officer not hit.
Offender down.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.661
Gunshot wound to head.

36:04.746 --> 36:06.831
Copy that, 80, 4-10.
Bus is on the way.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.671
Nice shot.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.852
And yep, he'd be dead.

36:28.687 --> 36:30.855
We'll hand it
over to the ME.
Thanks.

36:38.822 --> 36:39.780
Any way you
can get back
into Vice?

36:39.948 --> 36:41.657
I would if
I wanted to.

36:47.747 --> 36:48.873
You okay?

36:50.667 --> 36:52.543
Yeah, I'm okay.

36:52.711 --> 36:53.711
Thanks.

37:03.638 --> 37:05.931
Hmm. And check out those
names on the sheet, see
if you like any of those.

37:06.099 --> 37:08.058
Yeah.
Oh, I saw online

37:08.226 --> 37:10.394
that recording an agreement
is also beneficial.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.229
That way, if there's
ever a disagreement,

37:12.397 --> 37:15.149
instead of looking
at a bunch of words,
you can see yourself

37:15.317 --> 37:18.944
talking to the present you
and advising yourself to
behave rationally and fairly.

37:19.112 --> 37:20.154
So, what do you think?

37:22.657 --> 37:23.908
Um...

37:25.452 --> 37:27.119
I think Molly's is
opening up tonight.

37:30.916 --> 37:33.584
Have a baby first,
deal with this later?
Sounds good.

37:36.296 --> 37:39.381
Doors open in an hour.
I think we got it all
covered, right?

37:39.549 --> 37:41.759
You're all set, man.
The place looks great.

37:45.305 --> 37:46.639
Monkey's here.

37:46.806 --> 37:48.807
Are we insured for this?
I'm not even joking.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.192
That's the Stanley Cup.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.961
So, I guess,
in Russian,

38:17.128 --> 38:19.630
"Chimpanzee" and
"Hockey championship"

38:19.798 --> 38:22.174
are this close,
phonetically.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.640
That's the
Stanley Cup!

38:54.082 --> 38:55.207
Hank.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.838
Five K.

39:01.756 --> 39:03.966
Guy's name is
Maurice Owens.
Midlevel dealer.

39:04.134 --> 39:05.843
It's all in the report.

39:08.138 --> 39:10.264
Strange bedfellows, huh?

39:13.893 --> 39:15.686
This is a good start.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.067
Keep putting yourself
out there as dirty.

39:22.235 --> 39:24.862
Who knows what
fish we'll catch
in the net, right?

39:25.905 --> 39:29.033
I want a receipt for
the cash when you're
done with your inventory.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.327
You don't trust me, Hank?

39:33.872 --> 39:35.122
I want it by tomorrow.

39:36.583 --> 39:37.958
Keep in touch.

39:49.596 --> 39:51.889
Can I chug a
beer out of it?

39:52.057 --> 39:54.183
No, you know what,
I'm good. Get in here.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.371
Hey!

40:16.539 --> 40:18.707
Hey.
How you doing?

40:18.875 --> 40:20.459
How are you doing?
I'm good.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.422
Hey.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.928
Thanks for coming.
You look great.

40:34.766 --> 40:36.517
Hey.
How are you?

40:36.684 --> 40:37.935
Good.

40:38.103 --> 40:39.436
Good?
Mmm-hmm.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.147
Gary. Good to see you.
Good to see you.

40:42.315 --> 40:43.315
Really.

40:53.326 --> 40:54.868
Really glad
to have you.
How you doing?

40:55.036 --> 40:56.411
Nice to see you.

41:08.091 --> 41:09.424
This the real thing?

41:10.510 --> 41:11.510
Yeah.

41:16.808 --> 41:18.267
I, uh...

41:21.771 --> 41:23.605
One of our first
dates was a...

41:24.816 --> 41:26.817
Blackhawks-Devils game,

41:29.487 --> 41:32.447
and when she told me
she knew what icing was,

41:32.615 --> 41:33.949
I knew I had a keeper.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.458
This means a lot, guys.

41:49.799 --> 41:50.883
And...

41:52.010 --> 41:53.844
It means a lot to her.

41:55.722 --> 41:57.639
Because I'm sure
she's looking down.

42:05.315 --> 42:06.690
To Hallie.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.150
To Hallie.
