WEBVTT

00:09.583 --> 00:11.458
[theme music playing]

01:04.375 --> 01:07.416
[owl hooting]

01:16.166 --> 01:20.000
I saw the fiend!
It had fangs! And claws!

01:20.000 --> 01:22.708
It was horrible! It haunts us!

01:22.708 --> 01:24.708
We must do something!

01:24.708 --> 01:26.833
We shall destroy him!

01:26.833 --> 01:28.833
[crowd clamoring]

01:48.833 --> 01:49.875
[gasps]

01:52.958 --> 01:54.416
[woman 1 screams]

01:54.416 --> 01:56.000
[gasps] The demon!

01:58.500 --> 02:00.708
[speaking in German]

02:01.958 --> 02:04.125
-[man 1 in English] Get him!
-[crowd shouting]

02:09.958 --> 02:12.125
[man 2] Destroy the demon!

02:26.833 --> 02:29.583
[woman 2] Hurry! The thing is
trapped in that dead end!

02:29.583 --> 02:32.333
[crowd shouting]

02:32.333 --> 02:33.416
[man 3] Shoot him!

02:40.000 --> 02:43.250
It's vanished into thin air!

02:46.958 --> 02:50.416
Heartless fools.
They know not what they do.

02:56.166 --> 02:59.875
[Gambit] "I know," she say.
"Let's take a trip," she say.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.416
"It'd be fun."

03:02.583 --> 03:04.625
Huh! Some fun!

03:05.333 --> 03:09.458
After what we've been through
lately, I figured we could
use some time off.

03:09.833 --> 03:12.625
But you didn't tell me
we'd have a chaperon.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.583
Don't whine to me.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.166
This ain't my idea
of a good time.

03:17.166 --> 03:20.458
Hey, hoser,
I thought you like to ski.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.875
This is sitting around
drinking cocoa

03:22.875 --> 03:24.833
and getting funny looks
from rich people.

03:24.833 --> 03:29.333
Yeah? Well, next time,
plan your own darn vacation!

03:29.333 --> 03:32.958
Oh, chere, wait.
Well, I hope you're happy.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.708
Don't know
the meaning of the word.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.500
Come on, a demon?
You must be kidding.

03:38.500 --> 03:40.125
I heard it on the train.

03:40.125 --> 03:42.000
The whole town thinks
they've been under attack

03:42.000 --> 03:44.500
by some dark creature
for months!

03:44.500 --> 03:47.458
Must be some local
yokel superstition. [chuckles]

03:47.458 --> 03:49.000
Tell me more.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.875
I'll make it up to you.
We'll fly to Monte Carlo.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.583
We eat nice,
lie on the beach...

03:56.500 --> 03:57.708
[Rogue] Where're you going?

03:57.708 --> 04:00.000
Demon hunting. Interested?

04:00.000 --> 04:01.708
What hunting?

04:08.625 --> 04:12.208
Exactly how far
is this Neuherzl?

04:12.208 --> 04:14.166
A couple of more miles.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.125
Why? You quitting?

04:16.125 --> 04:18.000
It is getting kind of late.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.875
Maybe I ought to fly us there.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.625
What, and spoil Gumbo's fun?

04:23.083 --> 04:24.458
[shouting]

04:27.458 --> 04:31.375
Okay. So we don't ski much
on the bayou.

04:31.375 --> 04:33.875
[giggling] You sure
you don't want help?

04:33.875 --> 04:37.416
Of course not.
Gambit a natural athlete.

04:37.416 --> 04:39.375
-[shouting]
-Remy!

04:39.375 --> 04:41.833
Hold on! We're coming!

04:41.833 --> 04:43.875
[screaming]

04:45.958 --> 04:47.083
Ah, that better.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Where's Gambit?

05:03.500 --> 05:05.708
Come on, Remy. Say something.

05:05.708 --> 05:07.875
[panting]

05:07.875 --> 05:12.166
Man doesn't break a sweat
against Apocalypse or Magneto.

05:12.166 --> 05:15.416
So... so what nails him?
A pine tree.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.708
-Wait. Uh-oh.
-[rumbling]

05:19.083 --> 05:20.833
Avalanche!

05:23.125 --> 05:26.166
I'm coming! Grab on!

05:32.500 --> 05:34.125
[Wolverine yelling]

05:34.125 --> 05:36.250
[metal clinking]

05:37.000 --> 05:40.000
[grunting]

05:42.416 --> 05:44.708
[panting]

05:51.583 --> 05:52.708
[sighs]

05:52.708 --> 05:55.000
What in tarnation?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.875
Please, do not worry.

05:56.875 --> 06:00.375
This is home
to 20 members of our order.

06:00.375 --> 06:03.458
We minister to many
ski accident victims.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.583
[Rogue] Logan!

06:05.833 --> 06:08.166
-How is he?
-Gambit will hurt a while.

06:08.166 --> 06:11.166
-He'll be okay.
-Praise be to God.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.583
[sniffing]

06:12.583 --> 06:14.000
Who's the snoop?

06:14.500 --> 06:16.375
[Brother Michael]
Ah, Brother Reinhard.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.208
Please show our guests
to the visitor accommodations.

06:20.708 --> 06:24.416
Brother, is it wise
to have strangers around
at this terrible time?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.458
They are not
the usual travelers!

06:26.458 --> 06:30.375
Those in need are always
welcome, Brother Reinhard.

06:30.375 --> 06:32.875
Please have faith
in our mission.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.875
Y'all are monks?

06:36.875 --> 06:39.833
So, I'm the only woman here.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.458
Yeah.

06:41.458 --> 06:43.875
Therefore,
would you be kind enough

06:43.875 --> 06:48.583
to accept something more
appropriate to wear
during your stay?

06:48.583 --> 06:50.583
Don't wanna make
the natives restless.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.625
[Brother Michael] You should
take care where you walk.

06:57.625 --> 07:01.708
Some doors on the upper levels
open into thin air.

07:01.708 --> 07:04.875
The abbey was heavily damaged
during the war.

07:04.875 --> 07:09.708
So, Johann, besides praying
and ministering,

07:10.166 --> 07:12.166
what do you boys do all day?

07:12.166 --> 07:16.250
Our mission is to give shelter
and comfort to all travelers.

07:16.250 --> 07:18.583
And, of course,
to offer a place

07:18.583 --> 07:21.291
to renew one's relationship
with the Lord.

07:22.291 --> 07:25.708
Being close to heaven didn't
help us this afternoon, Father.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.875
Are you sure, sir?

07:27.875 --> 07:29.750
Have you lost your faith?

07:29.750 --> 07:32.000
What is it that you seek?

07:32.000 --> 07:36.208
Action. For instance,
I hear you got a demon
hanging around here.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.708
You mean down in the town,
in Neuherzl.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.958
Yes. Odd rumor, isn't it?

07:45.958 --> 07:49.083
Uh, personally,
I never met a demon.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.166
I better go check on Gambit.

08:18.291 --> 08:20.958
Oh! Pardon, Reverend,
I didn't expect...

08:20.958 --> 08:22.708
Hey! What are you doing?

08:23.708 --> 08:26.291
[coughing]

08:26.708 --> 08:29.250
[groans and coughing]

08:31.958 --> 08:34.166
Can't catch nobody
wearing this thing!

08:36.583 --> 08:40.000
[gasps] Oh, no!
They must serve the demon!

08:41.750 --> 08:44.583
[grunts] Ow! Tight fit!

08:47.625 --> 08:48.625
[screams]

08:50.250 --> 08:51.291
Hey!

08:51.625 --> 08:53.958
[grunting]

08:58.250 --> 09:00.833
There! You are safe now!

09:00.833 --> 09:03.750
-[gasps]
-Please! You do not understand!

09:03.750 --> 09:05.083
[groans]

09:12.208 --> 09:13.625
[growling]

09:13.625 --> 09:15.958
Try hopping over these, pal!

09:18.875 --> 09:20.708
[grunting]

09:28.875 --> 09:30.708
I do not wish to fight.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.416
[groans]

09:35.416 --> 09:39.333
You and me
are through dancing, Mr. Demon!

09:39.333 --> 09:40.958
No! You mustn't!

09:41.375 --> 09:42.458
Why not?

09:42.458 --> 09:45.583
Because he is my brother.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.208
Brother?
I don't see the resemblance.

09:53.208 --> 09:57.000
Brother
in the ecclesiastical sense.

09:57.000 --> 10:00.458
That is,
a member of our monastery.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.833
I am sorry
I startled you, Fraulein.

10:04.166 --> 10:06.000
I did not know you could fly.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.333
It's okay.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.958
I didn't know you could do

10:08.958 --> 10:10.625
whatever that was you did.

10:10.625 --> 10:11.833
Teleportation.

10:12.750 --> 10:16.208
I think of a place
I'd rather be, look to it,
and I am there.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.875
Gambit rather be
in Monte Carlo.

10:19.416 --> 10:20.708
[groans]

10:20.708 --> 10:22.083
Think you can work that out?

10:22.083 --> 10:23.333
Enough small talk!

10:23.708 --> 10:25.875
Are you the guy
who attacked Gambit?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.583
Of course not!

10:27.583 --> 10:31.583
Brother Nightcrawler
is a man of God.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.875
But, you are the demon
we heard tell about?

10:34.875 --> 10:37.625
In a manner of speaking, yes.

10:37.625 --> 10:40.250
Like yourselves, I am a mutant.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.583
But unlike most mutants,

10:42.583 --> 10:45.750
my condition was obvious
from the moment I was born.

10:48.208 --> 10:49.875
[baby crying]

10:49.875 --> 10:51.166
[both gasp]

10:54.833 --> 10:58.583
[Brother Nightcrawler] The
villagers drove my mother away,
for bearing such a freak.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.166
I never even knew her name.

11:04.958 --> 11:07.708
She abandoned me.
But I did not die.

11:09.125 --> 11:13.291
Instead I was found by a family
of traveling performers.

11:13.291 --> 11:15.583
I became Nightcrawler,

11:15.583 --> 11:18.750
the star attraction
of their little circus.

11:18.750 --> 11:22.000
For their freakish world,
I was perfect!

11:34.875 --> 11:36.458
But when the spotlight
went out,

11:37.250 --> 11:39.125
I was still an outcast.

11:39.125 --> 11:40.958
Shunned and hated.

11:41.458 --> 11:43.708
Guess there no peace
for the wicked-looking.

11:43.708 --> 11:46.416
-Gambit!
-No, he's right.

11:47.000 --> 11:50.833
Though all people are flawed
and all struggle
with the capacity for sin,

11:50.833 --> 11:54.000
none likes to be reminded
of our shared human weakness.

11:54.000 --> 11:56.708
My appearance
does not make it easy.

11:56.708 --> 11:58.375
Don't it make you crazy?

11:58.375 --> 12:00.875
It did once.
But then I found peace

12:00.875 --> 12:03.208
by devoting my life to God.

12:03.708 --> 12:05.875
He directed me to this place,

12:05.875 --> 12:09.958
where they value
the character of my heart,
not my appearance.

12:09.958 --> 12:11.375
What are you talking about?

12:11.375 --> 12:12.625
We're mutants!

12:12.625 --> 12:14.875
God gave up on us
a long time ago.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.625
No, my friend,

12:16.625 --> 12:20.208
God does not give up
on his children,
human or mutant.

12:20.208 --> 12:22.583
He is there for us
in our times of joy,

12:22.583 --> 12:25.708
and to help us
when we are in pain.

12:25.708 --> 12:29.208
If... we let him.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.125
Don't give me that
easy answer garbage!

12:32.125 --> 12:35.166
I've tried!
Don't you think I want that?

12:35.875 --> 12:38.583
I don't need a sermon
from some circus-boy preacher.

12:39.375 --> 12:42.208
-Looks like you touched
a nerve.
-I am sorry.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
I did not mean to upset him.

12:45.000 --> 12:46.208
[Gambit] Fine.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.875
Now Gambit got a question.

12:48.875 --> 12:53.500
If you're not the guy
who tried to put me out
for good, who was?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.833
[Brother Reinhard]
People of Neuherzl!

12:55.833 --> 12:58.166
I can no longer allow
such sacrilege!

12:58.166 --> 13:01.208
The beast you seek is there!

13:01.208 --> 13:03.000
In the monastery!

13:03.000 --> 13:05.458
Are you mad?
Those are men of God!

13:05.458 --> 13:09.750
The Evil One
has defiled that holy place!

13:09.750 --> 13:13.875
It must be destroyed!

13:13.875 --> 13:15.875
[crowd shouting]

13:20.208 --> 13:21.708
You are searching for me?

13:22.958 --> 13:25.958
Nah, looking for
a moment alone.

13:25.958 --> 13:30.750
We are alike, you and I,
angry at the world,
and ourselves.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.083
My pain drove me to seek God.

13:33.083 --> 13:34.875
Yours drove you away.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.875
Don't tell me about God!

13:37.375 --> 13:39.750
What kind of God
would let men do this to me?

13:40.208 --> 13:43.708
Our ability to understand
God's purpose is limited,

13:43.708 --> 13:47.958
but we take comfort in the fact
that his love is limitless.

13:47.958 --> 13:51.000
[scoffs] I used to
buy into all that.

13:51.000 --> 13:54.625
But I've lived too long.
And I've done too much.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.875
Life will always be hard.

13:57.875 --> 14:00.083
I understand this
better than most.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.250
Yet despite it all,

14:03.250 --> 14:07.083
people of every faith believe
there is a God who loves them.

14:07.083 --> 14:09.000
Can so many be wrong?

14:10.125 --> 14:12.416
Open your heart, HerrLogan.

14:12.875 --> 14:17.208
Would it hurt so much
to see the world
through different eyes?

14:17.208 --> 14:21.583
Brother! There is a mob headed
up the road from Neuherzl.

14:21.583 --> 14:24.000
They must have discovered
you are here.

14:24.333 --> 14:27.125
And they want to rip you
into little pieces.

14:27.458 --> 14:31.000
Tell me, preacher.
What's God's purpose in that?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.000
Neuherzl is isolated.

14:33.000 --> 14:35.375
The people know nothing
about mutants.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.125
Perhaps I am here
to help open their hearts.

14:38.875 --> 14:41.208
I must leave
so no one will be hurt.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.625
Running away, preacher?

14:43.250 --> 14:46.000
What's wrong?
Lose your faith?

14:50.375 --> 14:53.875
Why? Why must they
always hate me?

14:57.458 --> 15:00.416
[crowd clamoring]

15:03.000 --> 15:05.500
Remember, Logan.
Those people aren't bad.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.708
They're just scared.
Be careful.

15:07.708 --> 15:10.583
Careful? Fifty against two?

15:10.583 --> 15:12.500
[Gambit] Trois, mes amis.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.958
Don't you know
Gambit's ready for anything?

15:14.958 --> 15:16.583
You sure you're up to this?

15:16.583 --> 15:18.625
Course, chere.[groans]

15:18.625 --> 15:21.000
Soon as the room stop spinning.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.166
[crowd shouting]

15:25.458 --> 15:27.166
Welcome Wagon's arrived.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.416
Devil! Out with you!

15:34.416 --> 15:36.083
[man 1] Destroy the demon!

15:36.083 --> 15:37.500
[man 2] Out with him!

15:49.250 --> 15:54.000
Again! Harder!
God is with us!

16:02.583 --> 16:05.291
First, you got to
get past me!

16:07.583 --> 16:09.416
[grunting]

16:11.875 --> 16:14.250
[all] Get him! Get him!

16:21.166 --> 16:23.458
Okay, people, now settle down!

16:24.166 --> 16:25.583
Don't touch me!

16:25.583 --> 16:27.208
[men groaning]

16:27.208 --> 16:30.000
Stop the demons!
Our families!

16:30.000 --> 16:32.458
They want to hurt us!
Destroy them!

16:32.458 --> 16:34.708
[screaming]

16:35.583 --> 16:37.458
Get out of my head!

16:42.458 --> 16:46.083
I'm trying not to turn
you bozos into hamburger.

16:46.083 --> 16:47.708
Now, back off!

16:51.125 --> 16:53.208
[groaning]

16:55.333 --> 16:58.458
Bitte, Frau Kohler!
You know us!

16:58.458 --> 17:00.875
-Please listen!
-Nein!

17:00.875 --> 17:02.958
You are a pawn
of the Evil One!

17:02.958 --> 17:06.000
Tell us where
your monster is hiding!

17:06.750 --> 17:09.166
I am not hiding!

17:10.250 --> 17:13.208
[woman screaming]

17:15.083 --> 17:18.291
The library?
How did we get here?

17:18.291 --> 17:22.166
[groaning] Gambit not enjoying
this vacation one bit.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.833
-Get him downstairs!
-What are you going to do?

17:25.833 --> 17:27.583
I will surrender.

17:27.583 --> 17:30.000
It is the only way to prevent
anyone else getting hurt.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.125
[grunts]

17:42.416 --> 17:44.375
Brother Reinhard! Stop!

17:44.375 --> 17:46.750
This is the end, demon!

17:49.125 --> 17:51.750
Be careful! The whole place
is catching fire!

17:55.583 --> 17:57.708
-Defiler!
-[gasps]

17:57.708 --> 18:00.583
The demon is attacking
Brother Reinhard!

18:00.583 --> 18:02.000
I shall surrender!

18:02.000 --> 18:03.166
No!

18:03.166 --> 18:05.416
You have corrupted this place!

18:05.416 --> 18:08.083
I must purify it!

18:08.083 --> 18:09.708
[shouting]

18:11.000 --> 18:12.583
[all exclaiming]

18:15.458 --> 18:18.166
Go ahead, demon,
do your worst.

18:19.375 --> 18:22.333
Why do you pause?
I have betrayed you!

18:22.333 --> 18:25.166
It is not for me to judge you,
Brother Reinhard.

18:27.875 --> 18:31.208
The question is,
how will God judge you?

18:31.208 --> 18:32.583
Look around you.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.166
This is the fruit
of your labors!

18:35.166 --> 18:36.250
Not mine!

18:36.250 --> 18:37.625
Lord, help me!

18:39.000 --> 18:42.333
I was wrong! I have sinned!

18:43.250 --> 18:44.625
What have I done?

18:54.125 --> 18:55.500
Thank you, my friends.

18:56.083 --> 18:59.000
Your presence here
was a great blessing.

18:59.000 --> 19:02.458
What do you mean, blessing?
Look at this place!

19:02.458 --> 19:04.875
-We blew it!
-I disagree.

19:05.208 --> 19:09.416
Brother Reinhard understands
his tragic mistake
and has repented.

19:09.416 --> 19:13.125
The townspeople no longer
look at me with fear
in their hearts.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.000
There was no loss of life.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.708
All are reasons to be thankful.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.375
What about the monastery?

19:19.375 --> 19:20.833
A great tragedy.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.875
But it was only
stone and mortar.

19:23.875 --> 19:28.291
The foundation
God has built in our hearts
can never be destroyed.

19:28.291 --> 19:30.000
Man, I don't get you.

19:31.083 --> 19:35.250
Here, I've marked
a few passages
you may find rewarding.

19:35.250 --> 19:38.708
Remember, HerrLogan,
"Different eyes."

19:43.208 --> 19:45.125
[Gambit sighs] Paris.

19:46.458 --> 19:49.125
Back in the civilized world.

19:49.125 --> 19:50.375
I don't know.

19:50.375 --> 19:51.583
Those quiet little monks

19:51.583 --> 19:53.166
were starting to grow on me.

19:54.166 --> 19:57.458
Face it, chere,
those monks kid themselves.

19:57.708 --> 20:00.958
We on our own in this world.
Life is random.

20:00.958 --> 20:03.875
Deal you a full house
or a busted flush.

20:06.958 --> 20:08.625
What'd I say?

20:08.625 --> 20:10.125
[sighs]

20:10.458 --> 20:12.250
What if he's right?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.708
What if there is nothing else?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.833
[Wolverine] "I will give
thanks to you, oh, Lord.

20:22.833 --> 20:26.958
For though you were
angry with me,
your anger turned away,

20:26.958 --> 20:31.083
and you comforted me.
I will trust
and will not be afraid."

20:45.583 --> 20:47.458
