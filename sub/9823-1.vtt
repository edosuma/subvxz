Why did something have to happen in Cicero?

19:40.915 --> 19:42.998
Because when I talked to you
about Davis & Main,

19:43.033 --> 19:44.533
you were ready to take the job.

I don't know. I just...

Well, Cicero has nothing to do with it.

It's my whole life.

made me come to Albuquerque.

20:14.615 --> 20:16.031
Ever since I got here,

all I've done is try to make Chuck happy,

that exactly what Chuck wants?

This is for me, okay?

20:31.498 --> 20:34.216
I-I got into the law
for all the wrong reasons.

20:34.251 --> 20:36.134
I'm trusting my instincts.

are better spent elsewhere.

we could quadruple
the whole inheritance, right?

25:41.859 --> 25:43.942
In my opinion?

25:43.994 --> 25:45.911
Fortune favors the bold, man.

25:45.946 --> 25:48.113
Now, if you guys are free
to join me for a drink,

25:48.165 --> 25:49.414
I can give you a quick consult.

25:49.449 --> 25:51.199
That's all right.
We were gonna do it ourselves

25:51.251 --> 25:53.034
through one of those online
brokerage websites.

25:53.086 --> 25:55.954
We're just gonna pick,
uh, a classic, like...

25:56.006 --> 25:57.756
I think they're called blue-chip stocks?

25:57.791 --> 25:59.674
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you can
totally do it yourself.

25:59.710 --> 26:01.459
Shoot for the tried and true.

26:01.511 --> 26:03.178
'Course, you might be putting
your cash in the Hindenburg,

26:03.213 --> 26:06.264
the Andrea Doria, uh..."Corky Romano."

26:06.300 --> 26:07.766
- [Chuckles]
- Right?

26:07.801 --> 26:10.552
They all seemed rock-solid
beforehand, but then...

26:10.604 --> 26:12.137
Yeah, not good.

26:12.189 --> 26:13.471
Not good, yeah.

26:13.523 --> 26:15.056
So, how do you know?

26:15.058 --> 26:18.360
Well, that's where someone
like myself comes in.

26:18.395 --> 26:19.728
Proven track record as a wealth manager.

26:19.730 --> 26:22.530
I take calculated but aggressive risks

26:22.566 --> 26:24.532
'cause I want to catch lightning.

26:24.568 --> 26:25.901
And I do.

26:25.903 --> 26:27.319
Practically a money-printing machine.

26:27.371 --> 26:28.536
[Chuckling] That sounds good.

26:28.572 --> 26:31.623
A money-printing machine.

26:31.658 --> 26:34.326
Listen, there's a little booth over here.

26:34.378 --> 26:37.162
There's some privacy.
We can talk. No obligations.

26:37.214 --> 26:39.414
We can just... just rap
about this a little bit.

26:39.416 --> 26:41.750
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah?

26:41.752 --> 26:44.002
What do you say, sis?

26:44.054 --> 26:46.554
Can we just talk?

26:48.842 --> 26:50.675
Electric slide on in there.

26:50.727 --> 26:52.260
And we'll just rap a little bit. It's no...

26:52.262 --> 26:54.012
My name's Ken, by the way.

26:54.064 --> 26:55.764
Uh, Viktor, with a "K."

26:55.766 --> 26:57.682
Cool. Viktor with a "K."

26:57.734 --> 27:00.769
And this lovely lady is?

27:02.572 --> 27:06.241
It's... Giselle. Giselle Saint Claire.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.492
Ah, lovely.

27:07.527 --> 27:13.281
Please, sit. I won't bite.

27:13.283 --> 27:17.252
So, Viktor with a "K"
and Giselle... exotic names.

27:17.287 --> 27:18.536
JIMMY: They're Dutch.

27:18.588 --> 27:20.672
Well, Boer, to be precise.

27:20.707 --> 27:23.458
Our... father's side of the
family is from South Africa,

27:23.460 --> 27:26.428
which is where uncle Humphrey passed away.

27:26.463 --> 27:27.796
South Africa.

27:27.798 --> 27:29.431
They grow them beautiful down there, right?

27:29.466 --> 27:31.599
Charlize Theron. And you.

27:31.635 --> 27:34.352
Oh. Well...

27:34.388 --> 27:37.105
I've never actually been,
but hope to go someday.

27:37.140 --> 27:38.707
Tell you what, by the time
I'm done with you two,

27:38.742 --> 27:40.709
you might be taking your own private jet.

27:40.744 --> 27:42.143
Nice.

27:42.145 --> 27:44.396
Excuse me. Hi. Uh, we are sitting here now,

27:44.448 --> 27:46.731
so, uh, we could use a wine
list, if you get a chance...

27:46.783 --> 27:48.550
Hey, uh, are a tequila fan?

27:48.585 --> 27:50.318
Yes.

27:50.354 --> 27:51.569
You down for that?

27:51.621 --> 27:54.990
You ever try Zafiro Anejo?

27:54.992 --> 27:56.958
No, I have not, but I'm down for whatever.

27:56.994 --> 27:58.493
Three of whatever she just said.

27:58.495 --> 28:00.879
- You got it.
- All right.

28:00.914 --> 28:03.331
So, stock market. A great investment.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.500
And you're picking
the right time to jump in.

28:05.535 --> 28:07.135
- [ <i> "Goldigger"</i> plays in background]
- Why do you listen to me? I'm an idiot.

28:07.170 --> 28:08.470
[Laughs]

28:08.505 --> 28:10.839
And talks about his cars, talks about...

28:10.841 --> 28:12.474
[Jimmy and Ken laugh]

28:12.509 --> 28:13.892
- How many cars did he have?
- I don't think...

28:13.927 --> 28:17.062
[Laughter]

28:17.097 --> 28:19.647
- It doesn't make sense.
- That's it, Ken.

28:19.683 --> 28:20.932
Oh, yeah.

28:20.984 --> 28:22.317
Compliments of the bartender.

28:22.352 --> 28:23.685
She thought you might want a souvenir.

28:23.687 --> 28:25.820
Oh, my God. Did we drink the entire bottle?

28:25.856 --> 28:26.988
Not yet, we didn't.

28:27.024 --> 28:28.490
- Boom.
- Hey, hey, cheers.

28:28.525 --> 28:30.859
Uh, I think we're ready for the check.

28:32.279 --> 28:34.863
[Laughter]

28:34.865 --> 28:36.614
[Groans]

28:36.666 --> 28:39.751
No, really, it's the smart way to go.

28:39.786 --> 28:42.120
KIM: Okay. But, so, to be clear,

28:42.172 --> 28:45.540
you take the money directly
from our account and invest it.

28:45.542 --> 28:47.876
- Diversify.
- Diversify it.

28:47.878 --> 28:50.595
And then all the dividends
and all the profits

28:50.630 --> 28:53.298
and the...what-have-you
comes back into our account.

28:53.350 --> 28:55.600
Boom. Absolutely.

28:55.635 --> 28:56.935
And you'll get a detailed statement

28:56.970 --> 28:58.686
showing you how much
your money is growing...

28:58.722 --> 29:00.438
biggest bulls of the month, et cetera.

29:00.474 --> 29:04.309
Ken, buddy... let's do this.

29:05.729 --> 29:07.946
Great. Right there, Viktor with a "K,"

29:07.981 --> 29:09.397
and, Giselle, you are next.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.032
- This is so exciting.
- Mm-hmm.

29:11.068 --> 29:12.534
Folks, it's been a pleasure.

29:12.569 --> 29:13.952
- Oops, I got that.
- Can't let you do it, son.

29:13.987 --> 29:16.988
Wait. What? Ken, you are the greatest.

29:17.040 --> 29:18.490
- Thank you.
- No problem-o.

29:18.542 --> 29:19.874
Hey, this will be the best
decision you'll ever make.

29:19.910 --> 29:21.376
Oh, I believe it.

29:21.411 --> 29:22.911
All right, well,
we should get out of your hair.

29:22.913 --> 29:24.412
- Yeah.
- Oh, wait, wait.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.048
This... is for you.

29:27.084 --> 29:28.583
Now, that's got all my contact info.

29:28.585 --> 29:32.470
Call me anytime with questions
or anything at all.

29:32.506 --> 29:33.805
Ken.

29:33.840 --> 29:35.974
Bye. Call me, guys.

29:36.009 --> 29:37.642
- Bye.
- Try and stop us.

29:37.677 --> 29:39.427
[Laughs]

29:39.429 --> 29:41.930
Wow.

29:41.982 --> 29:43.398
[Chuckles]

29:43.433 --> 29:46.768
Just wow.

29:46.770 --> 29:49.104
[Inhales deeply]

[Chuckles]

29:55.495 --> 29:58.947
[Exhales slowly]

29:58.949 --> 30:01.816
Hey.

30:01.852 --> 30:03.785
What I...

30:03.837 --> 30:05.420
Is this right?

30:05.455 --> 30:07.956
Yes, sir, it is.

30:12.129 --> 30:13.344
- [ <i>"Music & Wine"</i> plays in background]
- KIM: Go, go, go, go, go!

30:13.380 --> 30:15.597
[Both laugh]

30:15.632 --> 30:17.966
- Zafiro Anejo!
- Shh!

30:17.968 --> 30:20.135
He's gonna come out. [Laughs]

30:20.137 --> 30:21.636
Oh, no.

30:21.638 --> 30:23.138
I didn't read the fine print.

30:23.140 --> 30:25.473
- Wait.
- Yeah!

30:25.525 --> 30:27.392
[Both laugh]

30:27.444 --> 30:28.810
Holy crap.

30:28.862 --> 30:30.311
I can't b...

30:30.363 --> 30:33.531
[Laughing]

[Laughter, indistinct conversations]

30:58.779 --> 31:00.497
[Water turns on]

31:12.628 --> 31:15.295
Can I borrow that when you're done?

31:15.297 --> 31:17.797
[Chuckles] No, that's gross.

31:17.849 --> 31:19.549
H-how is it gross?

31:19.601 --> 31:21.301
Our germs have already intermingled.

31:21.303 --> 31:24.387
It's my toothbrush. It's different.

31:24.439 --> 31:25.889
Why is it different?

31:25.941 --> 31:27.807
Because.

31:27.859 --> 31:30.026
You know, gums bleed, and there's...

31:30.062 --> 31:34.197
there's cold sores,
all sorts of food and weir...

31:34.232 --> 31:35.231
Let me see that. Come on.

31:35.284 --> 31:36.483
What? No!

31:36.518 --> 31:37.867
Come on! I'll do it right now.

31:37.903 --> 31:39.319
- I don't care.
- I need to brush my teeth.

31:39.371 --> 31:40.870
I don't have an extra. It's not my problem.

31:40.906 --> 31:43.823
That's fine. I got this.

31:48.380 --> 31:49.829
Good. I'm fine with this.

31:49.881 --> 31:51.414
Yeah, me too.

31:51.466 --> 31:52.916
Wait till you see what I floss with.

[Laughing]

32:05.931 --> 32:08.014
[Jewelry clattering]

32:13.855 --> 32:16.239
That's a keeper.

32:16.274 --> 32:19.743
[Chuckles] Thank you, Viktor with a "K."

32:22.164 --> 32:25.198
Hey, wouldn't it be great
if we could do that every night?

32:25.250 --> 32:27.283
Yes, it would.

32:29.921 --> 32:31.921
But...

32:31.957 --> 32:34.958
We can't.

32:35.010 --> 32:37.043
I know, yeah.

32:37.045 --> 32:41.297
But I'm just saying,
if we could, it would be great.

32:41.350 --> 32:43.466
But I know we can't.

32:43.518 --> 32:46.886
Oh, crap. I can't be late today.

32:47.689 --> 32:49.556
Howard is doling out assignments,

32:49.558 --> 32:51.441
and the last one through the door

32:51.476 --> 32:54.728
could get stuck in doc review.

32:58.749 --> 33:00.549
You got somewhere to go?

33:00.585 --> 33:04.536
Yeah. Uh, yeah, I got somewhere.

33:12.380 --> 33:14.179
You good?

33:14.215 --> 33:17.349
[Sighs] Yeah. All good.

I'm Officer Baker. This is Officer Saxton.

33:54.589 --> 33:57.623
Yeah, please. Come on in.

33:57.676 --> 34:00.710
Come in. It's over here.

34:00.762 --> 34:02.462
See what they did?

34:02.514 --> 34:03.796
I mean, all gone.

34:03.848 --> 34:05.181
All of them, just...

34:05.216 --> 34:06.849
Uh, what's all gone?

34:06.885 --> 34:09.936
I have... I <i> had</i>
a baseball-card collection...

34:09.971 --> 34:12.304
a <i>major</i> collection... All stolen.

34:12.357 --> 34:14.107
Oh, sorry to hear that.

34:14.141 --> 34:16.391
Uh, was it common knowledge
that you have baseball cards?

34:16.444 --> 34:18.277
No, not really.

34:18.313 --> 34:20.980
So, nobody in particular
you can think of wanting them?

34:21.032 --> 34:23.983
No. Not that I... No.

34:24.034 --> 34:25.451
How'd they get in?

34:25.487 --> 34:28.321
Uh, the back door over here.

34:28.373 --> 34:30.123
It was open when I came home for lunch.

34:30.158 --> 34:31.708
I mean, it was locked,

34:31.743 --> 34:34.460
but they must have jimmied it
open or something.

34:34.496 --> 34:35.795
Uh-huh.

34:35.830 --> 34:38.380
At what time, uh, you figure this happened?

34:38.416 --> 34:41.551
I left for work at 8:15,
came home for lunch at 12:30,

34:41.585 --> 34:42.719
and called you immediately.

34:42.754 --> 34:44.170
Was anything else taken?

34:44.222 --> 34:46.556
Cash... a fair bit. Uh, um...

34:46.591 --> 34:47.924
How much cash?

34:47.976 --> 34:49.509
Uh, I don't know.

34:49.561 --> 34:52.645
You know, let's focus on
what's important here, you know?

34:52.679 --> 34:55.098
All I really care about
are my baseball cards.

34:55.150 --> 34:57.767
You know, I have a Topps
Mickey Mantle rookie card

34:57.819 --> 34:59.435
that's irreplaceable.

34:59.487 --> 35:02.488
It's a mint, 60/40, 90/10 on the reverse.

35:02.524 --> 35:03.656
I can go on.

35:03.691 --> 35:05.358
All my cards are in top-loaders,

35:05.410 --> 35:08.161
but if they're taken out
and exposed to the elements,

35:08.196 --> 35:10.913
I mean, or creased, God forbid,

35:10.949 --> 35:12.482
I mean, you're looking at
a 9-point downgrade

35:12.517 --> 35:14.717
in a matter of seconds.

35:14.753 --> 35:16.536
I understand the first 48 hours

35:16.588 --> 35:19.288
are the most important
in investigations like this,

35:19.340 --> 35:21.007
so the more time passes,

35:21.042 --> 35:23.876
I mean, the less likely
we are of a recovery.

35:23.928 --> 35:28.431
So...time is of the essence here, guys.

35:28.466 --> 35:30.933
Well, we're gonna help you out
the best we can, Mr. Wormald.

35:30.969 --> 35:32.552
Good.

35:32.604 --> 35:35.438
Well...they really tossed this place.

35:35.473 --> 35:36.856
-[Scoffs]
-I mean, are you sure

35:36.891 --> 35:38.891
they weren't looking for anything else?

35:38.943 --> 35:40.476
Like what?

35:40.478 --> 35:43.446
I don't know.
J-Just wondering your thoughts.

35:43.481 --> 35:46.282
I assume more baseball cards.

35:46.317 --> 35:48.918
Did you have more baseball cards than the
ones you keep locked in that case here?

35:48.953 --> 35:50.987
Yes, in... in back... thousands.

35:50.989 --> 35:53.906
But these were the crown jewels over here.

35:53.958 --> 35:55.908
You know, t-the all-star lineup.

35:55.960 --> 35:58.494
Right.

35:58.496 --> 35:59.962
Hmm.

35:59.998 --> 36:02.999
What?

36:03.001 --> 36:04.550
Just trying to make sense of it.

36:04.586 --> 36:06.636
What's to make sense of?
I mean, isn't it as simple

36:06.671 --> 36:09.472
as the perp was looking
for more baseball cards?

36:09.507 --> 36:11.307
Or hopped up on speed or whatever

36:11.342 --> 36:14.060
and went nuts with the vandalism?

36:14.095 --> 36:16.262
Yeah. I mean, that could be.

36:16.314 --> 36:18.598
Yeah.

36:18.650 --> 36:20.266
Pretty sweet Hummer parked in the driveway.

36:20.318 --> 36:21.684
That yours?

36:21.719 --> 36:22.852
Yeah, that's mine.

36:22.854 --> 36:25.188
Uh, it's a lease.

36:25.190 --> 36:28.407
Got a great deal on it.

36:28.443 --> 36:31.494
It's very sweet.

36:31.529 --> 36:33.196
You know, they say Arnold Schwarzenegger

36:33.198 --> 36:34.697
is the reason that Hummers exist.

36:34.699 --> 36:36.999
I don't know how, but that's what they say.

36:37.035 --> 36:37.667
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

36:37.702 --> 36:39.752
Huh.

36:39.787 --> 36:42.588
What kind of work do you do, Mr. Wormald?

36:42.624 --> 36:44.423
Uh, I work I.T.,

36:44.459 --> 36:47.627
uh, for a pharmaceutical company.

36:47.679 --> 36:49.679
Wow. Computers.

36:49.714 --> 36:52.014
God, I should've gotten into computers.

36:52.050 --> 36:54.350
- I'd have that same Hummer.
- [Chuckles] Yeah, right.

36:54.385 --> 36:56.719
Look, guys, I'm glad you like my car,

36:56.721 --> 36:58.471
but I think we're looking through

36:58.523 --> 37:01.057
the wrong end of the telescope here.

37:01.059 --> 37:03.943
You know, the priority is my baseball cards.

37:03.978 --> 37:05.194
Of course.

37:05.230 --> 37:07.563
Yes, now, I have a detailed manifest

37:07.615 --> 37:09.866
of my entire collection

37:09.901 --> 37:13.236
and asterisks next to the high-ticket items,

37:13.238 --> 37:15.238
so it's clear which ones they're
gonna try to fence first,

37:15.240 --> 37:18.457
'cause they're super, super valuable.

37:18.493 --> 37:21.160
So you're gonna want to get
this list out to pawnshops,

37:21.212 --> 37:24.580
uh, collectors, question anyone who's done

37:24.582 --> 37:26.249
any sort of crime like this in the past.

37:26.301 --> 37:29.218
You know, the... the usual suspects.

37:29.254 --> 37:32.088
Uh, can I get you the list
so you can start investigating?

37:32.090 --> 37:34.173
Yeah, you... Yeah,
if you could get us that list...

37:34.225 --> 37:36.342
Okay, I'll... I'll print it out.

37:36.394 --> 37:40.346
Hank Aaron, mint.
God, my signed Derek Jeter.

37:40.398 --> 37:42.648
Willie Mays, O-Pee-Chee.

37:42.684 --> 37:45.184
Got to breathe. Just keep breathing.

37:45.236 --> 37:46.319
Keep breathing.

37:46.354 --> 37:48.521
- Okay.
- I know, right?

37:48.573 --> 37:50.406
- Left the TV.
- Uh-huh.

37:50.441 --> 37:52.775
- Left the computer.
- Right.

37:54.913 --> 37:56.145
Huh.

38:02.420 --> 38:04.320
There's something wrong with this picture.

38:10.428 --> 38:12.878
[Printer whirring in distance]

38:37.989 --> 38:39.655
[Flashlight clicks]

38:50.501 --> 38:51.834

[Sighs]

39:22.883 --> 39:25.383
[Dialing]

39:29.707 --> 39:31.340
Hey, it's me.

39:31.376 --> 39:33.709
Another perfect day in paradise out here.

39:33.711 --> 39:34.961
I'm in the pool.

39:35.013 --> 39:38.214
Okay, call me.

39:38.216 --> 39:40.716
[Cellphone beeps]

39:53.898 --> 39:56.732
- Hi! How are you?
- Hey, babe. Did you get lunch?

39:56.734 --> 39:58.151
WOMAN: I did.

39:58.203 --> 39:59.986
MAN: You know, I think
I'm burning up back here.

40:00.038 --> 40:01.788
Oh, really? Well, you're just in luck.

40:01.823 --> 40:03.406
- Look what I have.
- Oh, hey, great.

40:07.412 --> 40:09.245
Oh, yeah, you're all red back here.

40:09.247 --> 40:11.631
Yeah. That feels good, babe.

40:11.666 --> 40:13.442
- [Dialing]
- I told you not to

40:13.454 --> 40:15.229
spend so much time in the sun.

40:15.253 --> 40:17.970
You don't listen.

40:18.006 --> 40:19.922
Yeah, it's me again.

40:19.924 --> 40:24.060
Listen, as I speak,
not 25 feet away from me,

40:24.095 --> 40:27.313
I'm looking at <i>the</i> mark.

40:27.348 --> 40:31.100
Think Thurston Howell III
if he shacked up with Ginger.

40:31.102 --> 40:33.169
[Chuckles] He's dripping in Gucci.

40:33.204 --> 40:35.338
It's like I'm at the watering hole,

40:35.373 --> 40:38.357
and I'm watching the fattest,
slowest water buffalo

40:38.409 --> 40:42.778
expose his neck to me, and
I'm the lioness ready to strike.

40:42.780 --> 40:45.114
[Chuckles] Come, Kim.

40:45.116 --> 40:49.368
Join me. Join the pride.

40:51.456 --> 40:53.372
Um, I said "lioness"

40:53.424 --> 40:56.175
because it's the females
who do all the hunting.

40:56.211 --> 40:59.462
Uh, just wanted to be species-accurate,

40:59.464 --> 41:00.963
irrespective of my own sex.

41:00.965 --> 41:03.549
It's a <i>National Geographic</i> thing. Anyway...

41:03.601 --> 41:06.219
Get out here.

41:06.271 --> 41:07.687
Bye.

41:07.722 --> 41:10.223
[Cellphone beeps]

[Chuckles]

41:41.839 --> 41:44.340
[Dialing]

41:50.765 --> 41:52.682
Santa Fe, New Mexico.

41:52.684 --> 41:56.852
I need the number
of a law firm... Davis & Main.

41:56.854 --> 42:00.690
Yeah, you can connect me.

43:28.279 --> 43:31.580
[Indistinct conversations]

43:33.618 --> 43:35.835
[Telephone rings in distance]

43:35.870 --> 43:37.586
WOMAN: Davis & Main.

43:37.622 --> 43:41.340
OMAR: There are a few options
on the company cars.

43:41.376 --> 43:43.426
We can arrange a test-drive
whenever you'd like.

43:43.461 --> 43:45.378
Company car... wow.

43:45.430 --> 43:48.047
And there's a service that will
deliver it right to you,

43:48.099 --> 43:49.515
wherever you want.

43:49.550 --> 43:51.100
And if you find you're not happy with it,

43:51.135 --> 43:53.052
it's not a big deal to change it out.

43:53.104 --> 43:55.354
That sounds really, uh...

43:55.390 --> 43:57.440
[Sighs] Yeah.

44:05.199 --> 44:07.900
This is, uh, interesting.

44:07.952 --> 44:09.318
Oh, if, uh... [Chuckles]

44:09.320 --> 44:11.454
If this isn't to your taste,

44:11.489 --> 44:13.406
we have a collection of art in-house

44:13.458 --> 44:15.041
you can, uh, choose from.

44:15.076 --> 44:16.059
Anytime you're ready,

44:16.133 --> 44:17.432
I can put together some
samples for you to review.

44:17.995 --> 44:20.713
I... I... No, I like this.

44:20.748 --> 44:25.384
Good. Uh, well, any other needs
you have, I'm here to help.

44:25.420 --> 44:27.586
Office supplies, dietary needs...

44:27.638 --> 44:30.556
Anything special you want
stocked in the fridge?

44:30.591 --> 44:34.009
Uh, maybe a humidifier?
Gets kind of dry in here.

44:34.011 --> 44:36.896
Omar, I... I'm pretty low-maintenance.

44:36.931 --> 44:39.849
Sure. Well, if there's anything you need,

44:39.851 --> 44:41.934
I'm right outside the door.

44:41.986 --> 44:43.986
Great.

44:44.021 --> 44:45.738
If I think of anything.

44:45.773 --> 44:48.908
Good.

44:48.943 --> 44:51.327
Hey, do you think, um...

44:51.362 --> 44:52.912
I'm just looking at this.

44:52.947 --> 44:55.798
D-Do we get a choice of desks?

44:55.833 --> 44:57.366
What were you thinking?

44:57.368 --> 45:02.371
Um... is it possible, um...

45:02.373 --> 45:05.758
Can we do... cocobolo?

45:05.793 --> 45:08.427
Cocobolo desk? Absolutely.

45:08.463 --> 45:10.629
I'll get right on that.
