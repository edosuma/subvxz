00:46.025 --> 00:47.461
Hello.

00:49.232 --> 00:52.572
I'm Alan Strauss.

00:53.406 --> 00:55.243
Dr. Strauss.

00:56.412 --> 00:59.719
- Y-You're...?
- Candace.

00:59.819 --> 01:01.590
Sorry.

01:04.262 --> 01:05.698
I'm Sam's mother.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.403
Oh.

01:10.207 --> 01:13.246
Is this... your house?

01:14.415 --> 01:17.756
Sam moved back in with me
when he split up with Mary.

01:17.856 --> 01:21.162
- Ah, I see.
- Did he...

01:22.933 --> 01:24.603
You know about Mary, don't you?

01:24.703 --> 01:27.441
I'm sorry, I can't
really discuss that.

01:27.542 --> 01:29.111
Of course. Yes.

01:29.211 --> 01:33.120
So, you know who I am?

01:33.253 --> 01:35.624
Of course I do.

01:35.725 --> 01:37.528
I loved your book.

01:38.764 --> 01:40.401
When his father left,

01:40.467 --> 01:42.638
I started reading
all these books.

01:42.772 --> 01:45.177
You know, self-help.

01:45.277 --> 01:48.450
The Cactus and the Mirage
was one of my favorites.

01:48.551 --> 01:52.325
I had Sam read it, too,
but it didn't really help him,

01:52.425 --> 01:54.228
so I...

01:54.295 --> 01:56.366
told him he should try
real therapy.

01:56.466 --> 01:58.337
This isn't trying real therapy.

01:58.470 --> 01:59.673
Of course.

01:59.773 --> 02:02.077
I know how terrible this is.

02:02.144 --> 02:04.783
- Believe me, I know.

02:08.123 --> 02:09.692
Unlock me.

02:09.826 --> 02:11.496
I don't have a key.

02:11.630 --> 02:13.601
Well...

02:13.668 --> 02:15.839
call the police.
Then we can help Sam.

02:15.939 --> 02:17.474
Please understand.

02:17.609 --> 02:21.216
I don't support him
in this at all.

02:21.316 --> 02:23.821
I'm not... like him.

02:24.890 --> 02:28.096
But I can't turn in my own son.

02:28.162 --> 02:30.167
You're his mother.
Can't you tell him to stop this?

02:30.300 --> 02:32.606
He's trying to stop.
I know it's-it's...

02:32.706 --> 02:35.276
Candace, please.

02:35.343 --> 02:38.517
I have kids.
A son and a daughter.

02:38.651 --> 02:41.523
They need me,
just like he needs you.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.829
I know this isn't right.

02:46.365 --> 02:48.070
But you have to help him.

02:48.170 --> 02:50.340
He's my baby.

03:29.686 --> 03:31.189
You ever had pho?

03:31.289 --> 03:33.861
- Yes.
- Not like this, you haven't.

03:57.743 --> 03:59.345
I'm gonna get bowls.

03:59.411 --> 04:01.650
Sam, hold on a second.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.754
When you were gone,

04:03.854 --> 04:06.894
I heard someone
moving around upstairs,

04:06.994 --> 04:08.798
and I called up to them

04:08.931 --> 04:11.369
and asked them to come down.

04:11.436 --> 04:12.772
Did they come down?

04:14.943 --> 04:17.347
- So you met my mother.
- Yes.

04:17.447 --> 04:21.524
I was a little surprised.
Y-You said she was dead.

04:21.624 --> 04:24.530
Yeah, my parents aren't dead.

04:24.630 --> 04:26.466
I-I lied about that, too.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.871
Sorry.

04:30.775 --> 04:32.645
One of the reasons
that I didn't want

04:32.779 --> 04:34.550
to go into therapy

04:34.616 --> 04:36.452
was because I know it's all

04:36.553 --> 04:39.425
"mothers, mothers, mothers."
My mother is not my problem.

04:39.526 --> 04:41.863
Let me get the bowls.

04:57.795 --> 04:59.866
I'm going to

05:00.000 --> 05:02.437
need you to take off this chain.

05:03.807 --> 05:06.212
There's no way to do
this work effectively

05:06.312 --> 05:07.815
with the therapist tied up.

05:07.949 --> 05:10.220
The chain's on your leg,
not on your mouth.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.427
Sam, I present
no physical threat to you.

05:13.493 --> 05:16.298
You're young and strong,

05:16.399 --> 05:19.506
and I-I... I sit
in a chair all day.

05:19.639 --> 05:23.446
What do you imagine
would happen if I attacked you?

05:27.020 --> 05:29.792
I... I pictured this
with you chained to the floor.

05:29.859 --> 05:32.464
I understand,
and I am asking you

05:32.532 --> 05:34.067
to adjust that

05:34.201 --> 05:37.474
so I can help you
more effectively.

05:37.575 --> 05:42.284
Sam, there is no way that
this is going to work

05:42.351 --> 05:44.421
unless you take off this chain.

05:48.229 --> 05:50.433
She usually doesn't
come down here.

06:03.460 --> 06:07.267
Before, when we were
in my office...

06:07.367 --> 06:10.373
you told me that your mother
took care of you

06:10.473 --> 06:12.077
when your father
was being violent.

06:12.177 --> 06:13.613
"Mothers, mothers, mothers."

06:13.714 --> 06:16.953
It's just one part of things,
Sam, but we can't ignore it.

06:19.225 --> 06:22.397
Your mother told me
that he left.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.405
Can you tell me about that?

06:26.539 --> 06:27.909
He left us.

06:28.009 --> 06:29.979
How old were you?

06:31.716 --> 06:32.585
Fourteen.

06:33.386 --> 06:35.557
And what do you remember
about that?

06:38.797 --> 06:40.735
He left us.

06:40.835 --> 06:43.306
So, he didn't hit me anymore.

06:43.406 --> 06:45.844
Did you see him after that?

06:49.418 --> 06:51.523
This is the house
you grew up in?

06:52.526 --> 06:55.063
Yup.

06:56.533 --> 07:00.607
Do you have memories,
um, like...

07:02.077 --> 07:05.517
Did he hurt you in this room?

07:07.054 --> 07:08.791
If I was in this room...

07:08.925 --> 07:11.596
- it was in this room.

07:12.999 --> 07:15.571
And you'd be here and...

07:15.671 --> 07:18.009
And he'd say something

07:18.109 --> 07:21.550
that I was supposed to do,
and if I didn't do it

07:21.617 --> 07:23.587
within one second...

07:24.555 --> 07:27.127
I didn't know what he meant
sometimes. I-- He was...

07:27.227 --> 07:29.699
I needed time to think,

07:29.799 --> 07:31.101
but...

07:32.906 --> 07:34.374
Like, one time,

07:34.474 --> 07:35.811
he got a whole load of grout

07:35.912 --> 07:38.483
for the kitchen
and the bathroom, and...

07:38.584 --> 07:40.821
he got a deal, right,

07:40.955 --> 07:44.495
so he ordered a ton of it,
and it came in these boxes.

07:44.596 --> 07:47.769
And he was yelling at me,
"Break 'em down."

07:47.835 --> 07:50.641
Screaming. "Break 'em down."

07:50.774 --> 07:53.313
I didn't know what he meant

07:53.413 --> 07:55.450
because I'd never
heard that before

07:55.551 --> 07:58.991
'cause he... he wasn't
pointing at the boxes.

08:01.563 --> 08:05.504
Then he just,
he just went at me,

08:05.604 --> 08:08.109
like he did.

08:13.185 --> 08:15.691
You said your mom got it, too.

08:16.226 --> 08:19.231
She's a good mother.

08:19.365 --> 08:22.037
She made me sandwiches
every day.

08:22.137 --> 08:23.840
She did the laundry.

08:27.615 --> 08:31.155
It's a terrible situation
for a mother and a son.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.605
Everyone, please.
Everyone, please.

08:55.705 --> 08:58.043
- People!

08:58.176 --> 09:01.082
People. People!

09:01.215 --> 09:02.952
I have something to say.

09:03.053 --> 09:07.060
People, people.
I have something to say.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.533
- I understand that

09:09.633 --> 09:12.204
the mother of the chatan
has some

09:12.271 --> 09:13.974
words she'd like to share

09:14.074 --> 09:16.178
with the new couple.

09:28.704 --> 09:30.742
We don't have women sing.

09:30.842 --> 09:33.747
Rabbi, it's my son's wedding.

09:43.299 --> 09:47.708
Hi. I'm Ezra's mom.

09:48.677 --> 09:51.015
- Where are you going?

09:51.115 --> 09:53.787
I'm also the cantor
at Temple Sinai.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.774
Talk to me, Sam.

10:22.612 --> 10:24.481
I know you're struggling
with your feelings

10:24.583 --> 10:26.753
about the manager
at the restaurant.

10:28.657 --> 10:32.030
Is there anything else
you can tell me about it?

10:35.638 --> 10:36.807
Uh...

10:36.907 --> 10:38.977
You should help me.

10:49.064 --> 10:51.803
Hmm...

10:55.778 --> 10:57.782
I have a thought for us.

10:57.848 --> 11:00.520
- Mm-hmm.
- You know,

11:00.621 --> 11:03.527
your mother
is an impressive woman,

11:03.627 --> 11:06.198
and she would clearly
do anything

11:06.331 --> 11:08.135
to help you feel better,

11:08.202 --> 11:10.775
help you live the life
that you want to live,

11:10.842 --> 11:13.847
and I think that
she can help us now.

11:14.816 --> 11:18.156
We are all part
of family systems.

11:18.223 --> 11:20.226
You, me, everyone.

11:20.359 --> 11:23.132
Changes to those systems

11:23.199 --> 11:25.036
can have a profound effect
on us,

11:25.136 --> 11:27.708
even at your age.

11:27.809 --> 11:28.978
And I was thinking

11:29.044 --> 11:31.582
that it might be beneficial

11:31.683 --> 11:34.321
if we were to do
some family therapy work

11:34.421 --> 11:35.857
with you and your mother.

11:39.098 --> 11:39.966
Mm.

11:40.066 --> 11:41.836
She's been through enough.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.814
She doesn't need to be dragged
into what we're doing here.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.617
I think that's kind of you,

11:48.717 --> 11:50.955
and I can see why
you'd want to protect her.

11:51.055 --> 11:52.290
But I don't think you need

11:52.390 --> 11:55.697
to worry about her feeling
dragged into this.

11:55.797 --> 11:59.137
I think she might
find it helpful, too.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.078
Sam.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.421
You don't have to take
this next step alone.

12:07.522 --> 12:11.997
There is someone
who wants to be there with you.

12:12.097 --> 12:16.238
She doesn't want you struggling
with this by yourself.

12:40.253 --> 12:43.259
He was always
a very physical man,

12:43.392 --> 12:47.234
and it was always
a very intense relationship.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.741
- I think Sam and I...
- He was an asshole.

12:50.841 --> 12:52.745
It's pretty simple.

12:52.879 --> 12:55.917
He was a terrible father,
and Sam and I...

12:56.051 --> 12:57.521
Worse than terrible.

12:57.622 --> 12:59.926
Let's try to slow down
a little bit.

13:00.059 --> 13:03.934
In this space, let everybody
finish what they're saying.

13:04.068 --> 13:06.873
When we go more slowly,

13:06.940 --> 13:10.112
usually, everyone thinks
a little more clearly,

13:10.212 --> 13:13.019
and sometimes, when we wait,

13:13.119 --> 13:16.291
people don't say what we think
they are going to.

13:19.264 --> 13:23.205
Sam and I took refuge
in each other.

13:23.272 --> 13:26.112
I learned that from one
of the books I read.

13:26.245 --> 13:28.082
Not yours.

13:28.149 --> 13:29.952
Hmm.

13:31.322 --> 13:33.425
That it was a refuge.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.129
You were in this together.

13:35.263 --> 13:37.334
Mm-hmm.

13:37.434 --> 13:39.438
You still are.

13:39.506 --> 13:43.913
You are bonded to each other.

13:43.980 --> 13:46.151
It's very moving.

13:48.389 --> 13:51.095
- Sam.
- Yup.

13:51.161 --> 13:53.399
You love your mother,

13:53.499 --> 13:56.939
and I think that can give us
a way to help you.

13:58.944 --> 14:01.415
I want you to think
in a new way of how

14:01.481 --> 14:04.522
you can protect your mother.

14:04.622 --> 14:08.328
As you struggle
with this impulse

14:08.429 --> 14:11.603
to become violent,

14:11.703 --> 14:13.741
I want you
to protect your mother

14:13.841 --> 14:16.478
by not acting on that impulse.

14:17.480 --> 14:21.188
So that she can be free
from this source of pain.

14:21.288 --> 14:23.359
So...

14:23.459 --> 14:25.430
you think to yourself,

14:25.531 --> 14:28.169
"I will not do this,

14:28.269 --> 14:30.974
so that I can
protect my mother."

14:58.563 --> 15:01.502
Will you do that for me, Sam?

15:18.436 --> 15:20.406
Okay.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.435
Pastitsio.

16:11.475 --> 16:13.412
That guy at the--

16:13.513 --> 16:16.084
this restaurant
where I did the inspection.

16:17.588 --> 16:19.592
I went back there tonight.

16:32.952 --> 16:34.088
Mmm.

16:34.154 --> 16:36.959
I figured I'd be okay,

16:37.059 --> 16:38.128
maybe,

16:38.228 --> 16:40.634
you know, with you here.

16:40.701 --> 16:43.305
I was just looking at him.

16:45.476 --> 16:47.080
How did that feel?

16:47.147 --> 16:49.318
I got my food.

16:49.418 --> 16:50.954
There he was.

16:51.054 --> 16:54.629
Mm, I sat in my car
across the street,

16:54.696 --> 16:57.500
and I did the whole thing

16:57.635 --> 17:01.441
in my head, every second.

17:03.179 --> 17:05.316
You said with me here.

17:05.416 --> 17:07.521
Was this a test for yourself?

17:09.024 --> 17:10.192
Yeah, I guess so.

17:13.132 --> 17:14.467
Seems like you did well.

17:16.338 --> 17:19.477
I-I want to show him...

17:20.514 --> 17:23.820
I-I want to teach him
how to behave

17:23.887 --> 17:26.358
to other people
in the world. I...

17:27.561 --> 17:29.464
I still want to do it.

17:35.543 --> 17:37.648
: Okay.

17:40.352 --> 17:44.227
Mmm. Mmm.

17:45.396 --> 17:46.231
Thanks.

17:48.703 --> 17:52.176
Was it like that
with the other ones who you...

17:54.682 --> 17:56.218
Did they do something

17:56.318 --> 17:59.324
that made you want
to teach them a lesson?

17:59.391 --> 18:02.063
Yes.

18:02.163 --> 18:04.736
They were all-- I...

18:04.836 --> 18:06.706
Every one of them deserved it.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.416
Candace?

18:52.363 --> 18:55.402
Candace, we need to talk.

21:16.886 --> 21:19.390
No. No. No. No.

21:19.491 --> 21:21.695
Stop.

23:39.972 --> 23:42.142
