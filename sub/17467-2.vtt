09:48.849 --> 09:51.199
And this is the bullpen.

09:51.242 --> 09:54.028
Wow. All these
people work for you?

09:54.071 --> 09:57.118
Yeah. I like to think
of it as a family, but

09:57.161 --> 10:00.382
if they don't kiss my ass,
they're out.

10:00.425 --> 10:01.252
Nice shot, boss.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.776
Thank you.

10:02.819 --> 10:03.994
So what do you think?

10:04.038 --> 10:05.735
You want to be a
real estate agent?

10:05.779 --> 10:08.129
I don't know.
It's pretty tempting.

10:08.172 --> 10:09.652
But?

10:09.696 --> 10:11.132
I'm just afraid
I'd always wonder

10:11.175 --> 10:12.786
what would have happened
if I had become a lawyer.

10:12.829 --> 10:14.265
Hmm.
I'm a lawyer.

10:14.309 --> 10:17.181
Oh, right.
Alissa, Christy.

10:17.225 --> 10:18.139
Hi.

10:18.182 --> 10:20.271
Hi. You're an attorney?

10:20.315 --> 10:21.838
Why are you
selling real estate?

10:21.882 --> 10:24.188
'Cause I want to live indoors.

10:24.232 --> 10:25.799
But you have a law degree.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.801
How come you're not out there
making the big bucks?

10:27.844 --> 10:30.804
Oh, she's adorable.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.675
I know.What? What'd I miss?

10:32.719 --> 10:35.373
Listen, honey, it's a
tough job market out there.

10:35.417 --> 10:38.855
I've got a lawyer, I've
got an MBA, an architect

10:38.899 --> 10:42.772
and a Dominican shortstop who
couldn't hit a curve ball.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.165
I quit law when I realized

10:44.208 --> 10:45.819
I made more money
waiting tables.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.995
Jeanine, she's scaring me.

10:48.038 --> 10:49.823
That's nothing.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.259
Liss, tell Christy
about that time

10:51.302 --> 10:53.304
that you were a public
defender in Oakland,

10:53.348 --> 10:55.785
and that junkie client
stabbed you with a pencil.

10:55.829 --> 10:57.395
It really hurt.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.310
Oh, God.

10:59.354 --> 11:01.965
Thanks, Liss.
Come here. Listen.

11:02.009 --> 11:05.752
Last year, she brought in
200 K in commissions.

11:05.795 --> 11:07.884
"K" as in thousand?
Yes.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.364
Is it too soon
to start kissing your ass?

11:09.407 --> 11:11.671
Never too soon,
Crackerjack.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.935
[sighs]

11:14.978 --> 11:16.588
Can you pass me a wrench?

11:16.632 --> 11:19.330
Crescent? Socket? Vise grip?

11:19.374 --> 11:20.810
The yellow one.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.769
Girls.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.292
Thank you.

11:24.335 --> 11:25.946
FYI, that's a crescent.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.948
FYI, don't care.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.124
Hey, can I ask you
a question?

11:30.167 --> 11:32.300
Sure.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.954
Were you
and Jeanine lesbians?

11:33.997 --> 11:35.651
[loud metallic thud]Oh!

11:35.695 --> 11:39.176
[sighs]

11:39.220 --> 11:40.569
Where did that come from?

11:40.612 --> 11:41.918
I don't know.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.920
The minute
she walked into the kitchen,

11:43.964 --> 11:47.402
you started acting all twitchy
like I am around my ex-wife.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.014
Um, well,

11:51.058 --> 11:53.930
I don't know if I'm comfortable
talking about this.

11:53.974 --> 11:56.237
I thought you said we shouldn't
keep secrets from each other.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.891
Hey, if you're gonna hold me

11:57.934 --> 11:59.762
to everything I say,
this is never gonna work.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.242
Oh, come on.

12:01.285 --> 12:03.287
Fine.

12:03.331 --> 12:06.551
Jeanine was gay, still is,

12:06.595 --> 12:08.858
and I...

12:10.904 --> 12:13.558
I don't know
what you'd call it. Uh...

12:13.602 --> 12:15.822
I had sex with her
for two years.

12:17.606 --> 12:19.826
Hmm.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.523
Please don't picture it.

12:21.566 --> 12:24.569
[chuckles]:
Oh, too late.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.964
Is this gonna be an issue?

12:28.008 --> 12:30.271
No, but I do have
some follow-up questions.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.663
Oh, man.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.927
All right, shoot.

12:35.711 --> 12:37.539
You guys really do
that scissor thing?

12:37.582 --> 12:39.846
[metallic thud]

12:41.935 --> 12:44.111
So now I don't know
what the hell to do.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.809
What if I spend thousands of
dollars to finish college,

12:46.853 --> 12:48.593
and then thousands
more on law school,

12:48.637 --> 12:50.726
and then when I get out,
there aren't any jobs?

12:50.770 --> 12:51.945
What if there's
a massive earthquake

12:51.988 --> 12:53.903
and the entire state
of California

12:53.947 --> 12:55.949
slides into the ocean?

12:55.992 --> 12:59.256
So, you're saying
don't go into real estate?

12:59.300 --> 13:02.825
No, I'm saying
we don't know the future.

13:02.869 --> 13:05.959
We can only make decisions based
on what's happening right now.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.699
Well, right now,
I'm closing in on 40,

13:07.743 --> 13:09.440
and when I finish law school,
I'll be almost

13:09.484 --> 13:12.400
[whispers]:
45.

13:12.443 --> 13:13.662
Why are you whispering?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.272
'Cause I don't want
anyone else to know.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.363
Oh, honey.

13:19.407 --> 13:22.062
But do I really want
to sell real estate?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.498
Maybe. I don't know.

13:23.541 --> 13:24.934
I do know I'd love

13:24.978 --> 13:27.241
to avoid paying off
student loans until I'm...

13:27.284 --> 13:29.286
[whispers]:
your age.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.594
[sighs]
So you got
a big decision to make.

13:32.637 --> 13:35.379
I know.
What do we think I should do?

13:35.423 --> 13:37.251
I can't make it for you.

13:37.294 --> 13:39.644
Sure you can. Just do it. Do it!

13:39.688 --> 13:42.430
Christy, I can tell you
how to stay sober.

13:42.473 --> 13:44.258
I can't tell you
how to live your life.

13:44.301 --> 13:49.524
Great. So I folded
these stupid chairs for nothing.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.874
I do have one suggestion.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223
What? I'll take anything.

13:53.267 --> 13:54.877
Pray on it.

13:54.921 --> 13:56.792
Ugh.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.881
You used to get loaded
every day.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.622
Now you've been sober
for three years.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.798
The same higher power
who makes that possible

14:02.842 --> 14:04.539
can help you through this.

14:04.582 --> 14:07.934
I don't know. I think my higher
power's kind of sick of me.

14:07.977 --> 14:10.893
Sweetie, God didn't
save you from drowning

14:10.937 --> 14:13.417
just so he could kick
your ass on the beach.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.464
You sure? He was pretty tough
on his own kid.

14:19.989 --> 14:21.773
WOMAN [on TV]:
...till he stopped.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.950
MAN:
You stopped them all right.

14:23.993 --> 14:26.213
WOMAN: How else did you think
this was going to...?

14:26.256 --> 14:27.823
[turns TV off]

14:27.867 --> 14:30.217
You were the lady, right?Oh, for God's sake.

14:30.260 --> 14:31.740
Oh, come on!
I want to know.

14:31.783 --> 14:33.220
[sighs]
I guess.

14:33.263 --> 14:35.962
Mostly... we'd switch off.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.312
How'd you decide?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.836
Coin flip, high card,
game of softball?

14:44.274 --> 14:46.407
[sputtering]

14:46.450 --> 14:48.626
You really need
to stop talking.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.847
But... All right, fine.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.241
WOMAN: You're gonna help me
take care of this,

14:54.284 --> 14:56.547
and then we're going
to get rid of his daughter.

14:56.591 --> 14:57.984
And don't worry...

14:58.027 --> 15:01.074
And picturing!

15:03.380 --> 15:06.035
Damn it.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.342
Sorry. Bad start.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.653
God, I really need your help
on this one.

15:15.697 --> 15:17.917
What do I do?

15:23.139 --> 15:25.489
Any time.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.624
What are you doing?
Praying.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.714
Mind if I join you?

15:32.757 --> 15:35.717
Sure. Adam driving you crazy?

15:35.760 --> 15:37.023
Little bit.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.590
All right, let's pray.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.204
[sighs]

15:46.119 --> 15:47.468
[sighs]

15:47.511 --> 15:49.078
You getting anything?

15:49.122 --> 15:51.124
Not with you
yapping in my ear.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.648
Sor-ry.

15:55.345 --> 15:58.696
[sighs]

15:58.740 --> 16:01.308
Should we try Satan?
I hear he gets things done.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.185
She's not with me.

16:16.540 --> 16:20.022
So anyway, I gave it a lot of
thought, I talked to Marjorie...

16:20.066 --> 16:23.286
Marjorie. Hmm.
What she have to say?

16:23.330 --> 16:25.680
She told me I should pray on it.

16:25.723 --> 16:28.726
Okay. Kind of hard
to poke holes in that.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.380
I know. I tried.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.686
So where'd you come out?

16:31.729 --> 16:34.254
I decided to stay in school.

16:34.297 --> 16:36.299
Really? I'm surprised.

16:36.343 --> 16:38.171
Can't explain why.

16:38.214 --> 16:40.260
Just feels like
the right thing to do.

16:40.303 --> 16:43.219
For once in my life,
finish something I started.

16:43.263 --> 16:44.264
You know what?

16:44.307 --> 16:45.743
I'm proud of you.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.049
I thought you'd be mad.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.311
Why would I be mad?

16:48.355 --> 16:49.921
You're sticking
with your dreams,

16:49.965 --> 16:51.532
and you're doing it
the hard way.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.403
Thanks.

16:53.447 --> 16:56.276
That takes guts,
takes character.

16:56.319 --> 16:59.540
You sure didn't grow up
to be your mother.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.063
I'll tell her you said that.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.717
Oh, please do.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.022
[laughs]

17:06.763 --> 17:08.114
I made you a little snack.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.854
Thanks.

17:09.897 --> 17:11.551
That's so thoughtful.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.119
No biggie. I like
doing things for you.

17:14.163 --> 17:16.209
Well, that's
good to know.

17:16.252 --> 17:18.211
What do you
think of her?

17:18.253 --> 17:19.733
Who's this?

17:19.777 --> 17:21.431
Stuntwoman friend
of mine, Rebecca.

17:21.474 --> 17:23.825
Doubles for Angelina
Jolie sometimes.

17:23.867 --> 17:28.351
Okay.She's gay, but she's always
been kind of flirty with me.

17:31.789 --> 17:34.227
What do you think...?

17:36.620 --> 17:39.058
Maybe...

17:39.101 --> 17:42.365
you know, we could
all grab... dinner?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.196
See what happens.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.286
Are you sure
you want to go down that road?

17:50.330 --> 17:52.506
What do you mean?

17:52.549 --> 17:57.380
If she and I hit it off,
what do we need you for?

17:59.991 --> 18:02.124
Let's just watch TV.

18:02.168 --> 18:05.997
No, no. It's my turn now.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.564
You ever dabble
with your sexuality?

18:07.608 --> 18:09.479
Hey. [laughs]

18:09.523 --> 18:12.134
I'm so straight, the word
"dabble" makes me uncomfortable.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.354
So never?

18:14.397 --> 18:16.486
No.
Not once?
No!

18:18.227 --> 18:20.708
Okay, a couple of times in
high school after gym class,

18:20.751 --> 18:24.015
the guys would have sword
fights in the shower.
Really?

18:24.059 --> 18:26.148
No, don't "really" me.
That's just horseplay.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.454
It's roughhousing.

18:27.497 --> 18:29.456
With wet, naked guys
in the shower.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.284
Shut up.

18:31.327 --> 18:34.025
Stop picturing it!
