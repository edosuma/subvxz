<i>Dear sir,</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:09.532
<i>my name is Catherine Weldon
and I live in New York City.</i>

01:11.822 --> 01:14.166
<i>I studied portrait painting as a young woman,</i>

01:14.825 --> 01:15.913
<i>but when I married,</i>

01:15.993 --> 01:18.667
<i>it was deemed unsuitable for me
to pursue a profession.</i>

01:22.082 --> 01:23.754
<i>Recently, I visited an exhibition</i>

01:23.834 --> 01:26.553
<i>of George Catlin paintings
of American Indians,</i>

01:27.129 --> 01:28.722
<i>and my breath was taken away.</i>

01:31.008 --> 01:32.760
<i>It was the freedom that struck me.</i>

01:34.177 --> 01:37.022
<i>Even inside the paintings,
the people were free.</i>

01:40.309 --> 01:44.900
<i>I discovered that no portrait of you,
the great Chief Sitting Bull, exists</i>

01:44.980 --> 01:47.069
<i>in any of our public galleries,</i>

01:47.149 --> 01:49.573
<i>and I intend to rectify the situation.</i>

01:52.821 --> 01:55.575
<i>Almost one year ago, my husband died,</i>

01:56.742 --> 01:58.710
<i>and I've been in mourning ever since.</i>

02:01.997 --> 02:02.839
No.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.012
Please stop here.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.070
<i>Now my deep grief has finally passed.</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:31.243
<i>And I can find consolation in my work.</i>

02:44.122 --> 02:47.629
<i>I've not sought the permission
of my father or my husband's family,</i>

02:47.709 --> 02:49.336
<i>so you may think
I am something of a renegade.</i>

02:50.128 --> 02:53.473
<i>I assure you, this is not by nature
but by circumstance.</i>

03:01.515 --> 03:03.688
<i>I've written to the Agent
to say I'm on my way.</i>

03:07.479 --> 03:08.856
"Dear Mr. McLaughlin,

03:09.606 --> 03:12.904
I have painted many portraits
of senators, congressmen,

03:12.984 --> 03:14.702
and even a vice president.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.285
But lately I took a decision to head west,

03:18.365 --> 03:21.204
with the intention of painting portraits
of Indians

03:21.284 --> 03:23.287
who've made their own mark on history.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.168
In particular, I'm keen to capture on canvas

03:26.248 --> 03:29.502
the last of the great Sioux war chiefs,
Chief Sitting Bull."

03:30.585 --> 03:31.677
Tell her, "Hell, no."

03:32.671 --> 03:35.469
She's also enclosed a letter
addressed to Sitting Bull

03:35.549 --> 03:37.096
to be delivered in person.

03:48.437 --> 03:51.282
New York liberals stoking the flames.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.534
When she gets here, arrest her.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.125
Hello?

04:45.619 --> 04:47.963
- Fresh linens, ma'am?
- Oh, yes, please.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.380
- How long till we get to Omaha?
- Half a day.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.425
- You're an Indian, aren't you?
- Yes, ma'am.

05:00.050 --> 05:02.223
- Which tribe?
- Presbyterian.

05:06.389 --> 05:10.394
I'm heading to Standing Rock Reservation.
I'm going to paint Sioux Indians.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.780
Have you ever been to Standing Rock?

05:15.941 --> 05:17.988
The Sioux hunted my people like rabbits,

05:18.068 --> 05:20.162
cut out their hearts and fed 'em to the dogs.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.367
You call me if you need any more towels.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.403
Ma'am.

05:52.018 --> 05:52.860
Thank you.

05:59.317 --> 06:00.906
Forgive me, ma'am, but, uh...

06:00.986 --> 06:04.115
very few unaccompanied ladies
travel beyond Omaha.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.495
Then they are missing some rare beauty.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.540
- You're not a soldier's wife?
- No.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.624
Soldiers' wives don't see the beauty
of the prairie, only its hazards.

06:17.752 --> 06:20.722
Well, are you gonna make me guess?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.225
You seem very good at it.

06:26.094 --> 06:27.265
You're a missionary.

06:27.345 --> 06:31.520
Oh. No, unfortunately,
I don't have the certainty.

06:31.600 --> 06:34.228
Well, the only stop left
is Standing Rock Reservation.

06:34.311 --> 06:38.316
If you're not a soldier's wife
and you're not a missionary,

06:39.524 --> 06:41.988
what other business could you possibly have?

06:42.068 --> 06:44.036
- I'm a painter.
- A painter?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.492
Yes, a full-time painter.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.790
I'd guess you came out here
from New York City.

06:51.870 --> 06:52.916
Why?

06:52.996 --> 06:54.793
'Cause New York is the headquarters

06:54.873 --> 06:56.962
of the National Indian Defense Association.

06:57.042 --> 07:00.171
From time to time, they send
their political agitators out west

07:00.253 --> 07:01.800
to stir things up on the reservations.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.301
I guess that's closer to the truth.

07:03.381 --> 07:05.258
I just told you, I'm a painter.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.264
Painters can be agitators, too. Often are.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.766
So, now I'm a spy?

07:09.930 --> 07:11.643
I'd guess you're traveling to Standing Rock

07:11.723 --> 07:14.477
to promote opposition
to the Allotment Act treaty.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.899
Sir, if I knew what the Allotment treaty was,

07:17.979 --> 07:20.944
which I don't, I probably would oppose it.

07:21.024 --> 07:22.237
You sure as hell couldn't paint it.

07:22.317 --> 07:23.613
I met you two minutes ago,

07:23.693 --> 07:25.696
and already you have accused me
of being a spy and a liar.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.242
I work for the War Department, darling.

07:27.322 --> 07:30.326
I didn't mean to be presumptuous,
but you do have that certain look.

07:32.243 --> 07:33.206
What look is that?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.750
The look of someone
filled with good intentions.

07:35.830 --> 07:36.672
Oh!

07:38.249 --> 07:39.296
And that's bad?

07:39.376 --> 07:41.674
West of Missouri, it can be lethal.

07:44.631 --> 07:46.634
Would you mind if I gave you
some practical advice?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.719
I don't really care for practical advice

07:48.802 --> 07:50.640
from someone who's such
a poor judge of character.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.222
May I take your order, ma'am?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.477
No, I'll eat in my compartment. Thank you.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.400
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

08:27.424 --> 08:28.346
Porter!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.683
Hey, not her. I need you here.

08:33.763 --> 08:34.764
Yes, sir.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.227
- I'll give you a hand with that.
- Oh! Thank you.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.197
- Sounds good, Charlie.
- Colonel.

08:44.983 --> 08:48.448
This lady here, she came all the way
from New York to paint Indians.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.825
Is that a fact?

08:52.407 --> 08:54.330
- Oh!
- I hope they fuck you.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.538
Cut the baby out,
like they did the Robinson girls.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.497
Indian-loving bitch.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.467
I'm sorry, Colonel. My blood boils.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.099
If you had any sense at all,
you'd get back on that train,

09:10.925 --> 09:12.427
return east with it today.

10:31.840 --> 10:32.716
Hello.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.520
Do you know somewhere maybe I could...

10:39.639 --> 10:40.857
hire a wagon?

11:24.851 --> 11:25.727
Oh.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.279
This is really very kind of you.

11:43.995 --> 11:47.460
So, is the weather often this bad?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.167
Or is this unusual?

11:55.006 --> 11:58.260
Please be careful.
There are bottles of turpentine in there.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.270
Wait!

12:03.223 --> 12:04.224
Slow down!

12:13.274 --> 12:15.902
Good afternoon. Agent McLaughlin?

12:15.985 --> 12:19.576
Colonel Groves. War Department.
Special Envoy for General Crook.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.657
Where's the rest of it?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.831
Yeah, General Crook's ordered
a 50 percent cut in rations

12:24.911 --> 12:27.625
of flour, bacon and sugar

12:27.705 --> 12:29.378
to take effect immediately.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.382
When a new treaty needs to be ratified,

12:34.462 --> 12:38.387
it's our experience that hunger
concentrates the Indian mind.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.980
This is my wife, Susan. Susan?

12:44.931 --> 12:46.979
Do you find that hunger
concentrates your mind?

12:59.570 --> 13:03.495
We don't encourage the use
of the old language on the reservation.

13:08.162 --> 13:09.414
Thank you, dear.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.091
Hot as hell out there.

13:17.171 --> 13:20.887
You fucking idiots in Washington
want to start another war?

13:20.967 --> 13:22.059
No, sir.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.938
Mr. McLaughlin, did you give permission
to that crazy woman

13:30.018 --> 13:32.146
to come onto the reservation?

13:36.024 --> 13:39.197
Agent McLaughlin.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

13:39.277 --> 13:43.032
Sorry. I look a mess.
It's kind of dusty out here.

13:43.114 --> 13:45.663
Well, we're in the middle
of a three-month drought.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.835
Sorry if it inconvenienced you.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.250
You got my letter?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.003
Didn't wait for a reply?

13:53.082 --> 13:54.834
Why would you refuse?

13:55.293 --> 13:57.840
Mrs. Weldon, I order you to be on the train

13:57.920 --> 13:59.718
when it returns east tomorrow morning.

14:00.340 --> 14:01.341
You order me?

14:02.592 --> 14:04.055
Find her a cabin for the night.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.637
Escort her back to the train in the morning.

14:08.639 --> 14:10.141
Can I help you with your luggage?

14:10.224 --> 14:11.521
Her luggage was stolen.

14:11.601 --> 14:16.232
Mrs. Weldon, I hope you made a sketch
of the thief before he got away.

14:26.157 --> 14:27.500
If I gave you money,

14:28.159 --> 14:30.082
would you get word to Sitting Bull I'm here?

14:39.796 --> 14:43.471
I'll be back tomorrow morning at dawn.
You'll be here, right?

16:06.632 --> 16:08.134
- Who is it?
- It's me.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.349
Go away. I'm writing to my congressman.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.191
You really should lock this door.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.318
Lot of thieves around.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.946
I'll be upcountry in the morning,
so I came to say goodbye.

16:26.194 --> 16:30.535
Maybe arrange to meet for dinner,
next time I'm in New York.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.583
Why would I want to have dinner with you?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.750
I don't know. We might get along.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.051
I paint a little myself.

16:43.878 --> 16:45.050
Landscapes.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.091
You're an admirer of George Catlin.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.310
- You know his work?
- You bet.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.645
I can't look at these
the way most people do, though.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.989
The scalp dance.

17:06.067 --> 17:09.992
Saw my first scalp dance
in the Black Hills back in '75.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.251
But when I saw it,
there were little blonde scalps.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.875
The warriors had stumbled across

17:18.954 --> 17:21.753
some Swedish immigrant children
walking to school.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.849
The little girls had blue ribbons
tied up in their hair.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.181
Mr. Groves, I've no doubt...

17:38.849 --> 17:40.772
terrible things have happened here
in the past.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.358
The past?

17:47.692 --> 17:49.740
You ever wish you were young again,
Mrs. Weldon?

17:50.403 --> 17:52.531
I mean really young. Eighteen.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.332
No mistakes. Still strong, still free.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.789
Well, on this reservation,
there's a whole nation

17:58.869 --> 18:00.462
wants to be young again.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.874
But their youth isn't in the past.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.255
Their youth lives in a log cabin
20 miles west of here down a dirt road.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.674
Their youth is called Sitting Bull.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.526
This is my other reason for dropping by.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.033
- I'm afraid there's a little blood.
- Blood?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.867
That old Indian stole your trunk,
drank the turpentine,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.667
so when the police went to get your stuff,

18:39.744 --> 18:41.747
he was drunk, pulled a gun, so they shot him.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.627
Maybe you want to put that in your letter
to your congressman.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.394
Mrs. Weldon! Time to go.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.021
I'm not leaving.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.822
Oh!

19:25.373 --> 19:27.712
Did Sitting Bull even get the letter
I sent him?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.635
No. Agent burnt it.

19:30.795 --> 19:31.796
He burnt it?

19:33.297 --> 19:36.016
Well, naturally.
He's God Almighty here, right?

19:36.592 --> 19:38.219
I read it, though, before he burnt it.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.222
Is it true you've painted senators?

19:41.305 --> 19:45.026
Before I married, I used to paint
commissions for the Smithsonian.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.772
I wanted Sitting Bull to know
that I've painted important people before.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.612
This isn't the way I came from the station.

19:58.406 --> 19:59.658
Where are we?

20:01.909 --> 20:04.537
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:21.178 --> 20:22.555
He's in the fields, digging potatoes.

20:22.638 --> 20:25.483
- Who is?
- My uncle. Sitting Bull.

20:30.688 --> 20:31.689
There he is.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.039
My name's Catherine Weldon.
I'm deeply honored to meet you.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.607
What happened?

21:15.316 --> 21:16.909
Don't I get an explanation?

21:22.823 --> 21:25.042
I had this stupid idea
you might be able to help us.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.370
Help with what?

21:28.120 --> 21:31.624
I've got friends from Indian school,
Kiowas, Comanches,

21:32.249 --> 21:34.798
and last summer
a new treaty took half their land.

21:35.753 --> 21:39.383
And this winter it's our turn,
but no one here gives a damn.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.264
The young ones just get drunk,
and the old ones,

21:42.718 --> 21:44.311
they dance a ghost dance.

21:46.096 --> 21:49.395
My uncle? He says his day is done.

21:49.475 --> 21:51.443
He'd rather dig damn potatoes.

21:54.271 --> 21:55.818
What good do you think I could do?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.661
I thought you could get a message
to your senators.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.323
Maybe they would listen
if it came from Sitting Bull.

22:03.948 --> 22:04.790
Let's go.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.997
I want to speak to him.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.167
So speak to him.
He speaks English well enough.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.342
When he wants to.

22:27.096 --> 22:27.972
Excuse me.

22:31.433 --> 22:35.563
I have traveled many miles from the east,

22:36.981 --> 22:39.484
across many...

22:40.734 --> 22:42.737
rivers and hills

22:43.821 --> 22:45.573
for the honor of speaking with you.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.289
You got a train from New York, right?

22:50.202 --> 22:51.374
Did you get a Pullman?

22:53.038 --> 22:54.756
- Yes.
- Nice.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.509
They gave me free cigars, too.

22:59.086 --> 23:01.050
I have a proposition.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.677
So, who have you painted before?

23:03.841 --> 23:06.764
Oh, Congressman Tom Ochiltree from Texas

23:06.844 --> 23:09.063
and Senator Eamonn Brooks from Idaho.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.937
- So, how much?
- How much for what?

23:13.017 --> 23:14.855
For painting someone's picture.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.563
Oh, I usually charge $40, but in this case...

23:17.646 --> 23:19.114
I mean how much would you pay me?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.948
I'd be happy to pay you $50.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.202
One hundred dollars.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.251
Five hundred dollars.

23:38.334 --> 23:40.052
One thousand dollars.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.890
That's a lot of money. I...

23:47.968 --> 23:49.845
I don't have that kind of cash with me.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.689
There's a First National Bank in town.

24:01.607 --> 24:03.234
One thousand dollars it is.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.571
Do we have a deal?

24:18.499 --> 24:19.421
What?

24:21.543 --> 24:23.090
It's raining.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.220
How long has it been since it rained?

24:31.595 --> 24:33.642
When Lakota first meet,
we don't speak for a while.

24:33.722 --> 24:34.560
Oh.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.768
Words get in the way
of getting to know each other.

24:38.352 --> 24:39.774
Sorry.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.527
You could throw some wood
on the fire, though.

24:43.607 --> 24:46.156
Lakota like a woman who works hard.

24:54.243 --> 24:56.245
That's not firewood. That's furniture.

25:05.045 --> 25:06.467
Maybe I could make some coffee?

25:06.547 --> 25:08.766
Well, to make coffee, you'd need coffee.

25:21.437 --> 25:23.440
The children want to see the woman
who brought the rain.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.544
- I've cleared this cabin for you.
- Oh!

25:41.957 --> 25:43.754
What will you tell McLaughlin?

25:43.834 --> 25:46.758
That I put you on the train.
You climbed off again.

25:47.588 --> 25:48.680
He trusts you?

25:49.339 --> 25:52.054
He thinks I spy on my uncle for the Agency.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.556
But it's the other way around.

26:31.048 --> 26:32.266
What do you want?

26:47.648 --> 26:51.403
You are dancing with the ghosts now?

26:51.485 --> 26:52.906
I spoke to the spirit of your father,

26:52.986 --> 26:58.618
and your mother, and your brothers,

26:59.409 --> 27:04.711
and your son, and Crazy Horse.

27:07.751 --> 27:11.255
They said the Bull must choose...

27:11.338 --> 27:13.932
between being a warrior or a farmer.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.079
Who was that?

27:46.790 --> 27:48.042
Shell King.

27:52.337 --> 27:56.342
This used to be his cabin,
until I told him to leave.

27:57.968 --> 27:59.265
He looked so...

28:03.765 --> 28:05.017
magnificent.

28:51.813 --> 28:53.235
Do you always walk this fast?

28:54.650 --> 28:55.863
Why?

28:55.943 --> 28:58.071
I'm trying to get ahead of you
before someone sees us.

28:58.946 --> 29:00.949
You don't walk ahead of a chief.

29:01.615 --> 29:02.787
Should I walk behind?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.578
Side by side is fine.

29:08.622 --> 29:09.874
Are you all right?

29:11.667 --> 29:14.091
Walking so fast has loosened my bullets.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.547
What bullets?

29:17.506 --> 29:19.759
I have four bullets still in my body.

29:20.926 --> 29:22.098
They move around.

29:26.974 --> 29:29.352
What does your husband think
about you coming here?

29:29.434 --> 29:30.526
I'm a widow.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.402
- I'm sorry.
- I'm not.

29:47.869 --> 29:50.998
Mrs. Weldon. May I speak with you in private?

30:00.424 --> 30:02.472
- What do you want?
- I'm here to rescue you.

30:03.218 --> 30:05.432
- Rescue me?
- Hear you got yourself kidnapped.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.351
These gentlemen are gonna
escort you to Cannon Ball,

30:07.431 --> 30:09.183
catch the next train heading east.

30:09.266 --> 30:12.270
That's very kind of you, Mr. Groves.
Go to hell.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.566
Mrs. Weldon, Dakota territory is hell.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.985
Since I've been here,
I've seen deplorable conditions,

30:17.065 --> 30:20.739
and I hear the treaty you're here to serve
will only make things worse.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.447
Look here, it's time you get on that train

30:23.530 --> 30:25.994
and report back to your seditionist friends

30:26.074 --> 30:27.542
in Greenwich Village.

30:28.452 --> 30:31.080
Well, If I take the train, I can be
in Washington DC by Thursday.

30:31.913 --> 30:35.417
The editor of <i>The Post</i> is an investor
in my father's shipping business.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.839
From his office,
I will go direct to the Senate,

30:37.919 --> 30:39.841
then to the Bureau of Indian Affairs,

30:39.921 --> 30:42.719
and finally accept
a long-standing dinner invitation

30:42.799 --> 30:45.176
with former Vice President Buckley.

30:45.185 --> 30:49.017
It'd be kind of unfortunate to meet all
those important people without all the facts.

30:49.097 --> 30:52.567
So, the truth is important
to both of us. Good.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.607
Maybe you should stick around
till General Crook gets here

30:55.687 --> 30:57.655
and I have the final draft of the treaty.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.280
Mrs. Weldon, do not give him reason to hope.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.240
No one here's forgotten or forgiven,

31:06.323 --> 31:08.576
least of all General Crook
and the 7th Cavalry.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.541
Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse
massacred the 7th at Little Bighorn.

31:12.621 --> 31:15.625
- I don't need a history lesson.
- It's not history till it's over.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.672
And for the 7th, this isn't over
until Sitting Bull's dead.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.136
And if they kill him, half the Sioux Nation

31:24.216 --> 31:26.093
will throw themselves
against the American Army,

31:26.927 --> 31:29.681
and Little Bighorn will be avenged.
You follow?

31:31.014 --> 31:32.891
I'm just here to paint a painting.

31:45.529 --> 31:46.621
Whoa!

31:53.954 --> 31:56.298
Welcome to Fort Yates, General Crook.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.133
Mr. McLaughlin.

32:00.419 --> 32:03.173
- Where's the Bull?
- A painter came from New York.

32:04.005 --> 32:06.678
Seems to appeal to Sitting Bull's vanity.

32:06.758 --> 32:10.349
He's having his portrait painted
while his people dance with ghosts.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.056
He's not gonna be a problem, sir.

32:12.139 --> 32:14.267
He's shown no interest
in opposing the commission.

32:15.308 --> 32:16.730
Get a message to this painter

32:16.810 --> 32:18.687
and tell him I'd like him
to join me for dinner.

32:19.479 --> 32:20.651
It's a woman, actually.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.944
Man, those New York ladies
love a bad man, don't they?

32:26.319 --> 32:27.946
Invite her to dinner anyway.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.392
This is the suit I wore

32:53.472 --> 32:55.600
to meet the President of the United States.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.480
It's beautiful.

32:58.852 --> 33:02.231
But I was hoping for something
a little more traditional.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.997
The Agent doesn't like us to wear buckskins.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.913
If the white farmers around here
see an Indian in skins,

33:14.993 --> 33:16.085
they get scared.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.709
Well, okay, then. The suit's fine.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.543
The Agent said we should burn
all the old stuff.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.138
Some we burnt.

33:37.098 --> 33:38.145
Some we hid.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.783
For $1,000, you should get what you want.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.446
You're gonna need a horse.

33:51.571 --> 33:52.413
No.

33:53.406 --> 33:56.329
- I don't ride.
- What?

33:56.409 --> 33:58.332
In New York City,
we don't need to ride horses.

34:15.804 --> 34:19.228
This is Rico. Buffalo Bill gave him to me.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.685
He's a circus horse.

34:24.187 --> 34:26.199
It'd be just like sitting on a chair.

34:27.524 --> 34:28.900
When you click your tongue...

34:32.529 --> 34:34.117
he paws the ground.

34:34.197 --> 34:36.416
When he hears a gunshot...

34:37.409 --> 34:38.501
he dances.

34:39.286 --> 34:41.208
Come on, stroke him.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.915
No, I don't want to stroke him.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.505
Wherever it is we're going, I'll walk.

34:48.043 --> 34:50.513
- Your shoes.
- My shoes are walking shoes.

34:51.965 --> 34:55.469
I paid $1,000.
If I want to walk, I will damn well walk.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.655
Does the snow stay
on the mountains all year round?

35:08.648 --> 35:11.322
It's not snow. It's bones.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.536
Buffalo bones.

35:14.154 --> 35:17.283
When the buffalo hear a gunshot,
they don't run. They stand.

35:18.533 --> 35:21.206
So the white hunters
could just shoot and shoot

35:21.286 --> 35:22.538
until they were all dead.

35:24.247 --> 35:27.126
We used to spend our lives
following the buffalo herds.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.592
Now they've all gone,
and we have to live in one place

35:32.213 --> 35:34.386
and ask the earth to grow potatoes.

35:40.472 --> 35:44.477
You'll never be free on the prairie
if you don't ride.

35:45.393 --> 35:46.690
Freedom's in the head.

35:47.979 --> 35:50.043
And in the feet.

35:50.523 --> 35:52.696
My feet are just fine.

35:57.072 --> 35:58.073
Try these.

36:00.909 --> 36:03.537
My old ones, soft buckskin.

36:12.420 --> 36:14.172
You got big feet for a woman.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.425
You got small feet for a man.

36:22.305 --> 36:26.151
It means "big feet."
Maybe that could be your Indian name.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.365
They called George Catlin
"Mystery Spirit Painter."

36:32.774 --> 36:33.992
Think of something like that.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.460
Whoa.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.428
She getting on that damn horse yet?

37:04.973 --> 37:08.193
You walk behind me,
looks like I've taken you prisoner.

37:09.060 --> 37:12.359
Behind. In front.
So many rules about walking.

37:12.439 --> 37:13.566
Can't I just walk?

37:33.251 --> 37:35.675
Rico's taking it pretty badly
you don't like him.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.513
It's okay, Rico. She's from New York.

37:41.593 --> 37:43.186
I thought you liked New York.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.558
Too many people with too much.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.515
Too many people with nothing at all.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.354
Your society values people
by how much you have,

37:54.814 --> 37:56.657
ours by how much we give away.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.926
Soft. Feel.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.267
We used to use the buffalo's brains
to soften the hide.

39:09.264 --> 39:13.645
Every animal has exactly enough brains
to tan its own hide.

39:14.686 --> 39:15.653
Never too much.

39:17.272 --> 39:18.194
Never too little.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.355
You can look now.

40:15.121 --> 40:16.543
You think you could wear your feathers?

40:21.377 --> 40:22.219
Why not?

40:23.713 --> 40:25.590
Same reason you don't wear
your wedding dress.

40:31.471 --> 40:32.893
I need you to come outside, though.

40:33.556 --> 40:34.978
You can paint me in here.

40:36.059 --> 40:37.356
There's no light in here.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.817
You can't see my face?

40:44.275 --> 40:48.530
When you've smoked, you'll come outside, yes?

40:50.281 --> 40:54.002
Mrs. Weldon, don't talk to me
like you don't know who I am.

40:54.661 --> 40:55.583
I'll be outside.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.989
So, Mrs. Weldon,

41:30.488 --> 41:32.240
how come you're scared of horses?

41:40.915 --> 41:42.588
I got locked in a stable.

41:43.793 --> 41:47.717
My dad's best saddle horse, called Sultan.

41:47.797 --> 41:49.299
I was eight years old.

41:51.300 --> 41:52.472
My father...

41:54.012 --> 41:55.639
locked me in there on purpose.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.977
Since then, I haven't ridden horses.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.198
Why would he do that?

42:08.568 --> 42:11.037
Decided I needed to be taught to obey,

42:14.323 --> 42:15.620
broken like a horse,

42:20.496 --> 42:24.296
because I wasn't... behaving like a lady.

42:31.257 --> 42:33.351
It was the way I wiped my mouth...

42:39.432 --> 42:41.856
at the dinner table,
our country place, and some...

42:43.102 --> 42:45.321
some grand people came to dinner.

42:50.026 --> 42:51.323
I was eight years old, and...

42:55.490 --> 42:57.413
I wiped my mouth with my sleeve.

43:03.164 --> 43:05.838
I was traded from father to husband.

43:08.920 --> 43:10.513
I've decided to change.

43:11.422 --> 43:16.519
I'm trying... not to care
what people think of me.

43:21.224 --> 43:24.774
That's why I'm out here on my own in the...

43:27.855 --> 43:29.107
middle of nowhere.

43:36.280 --> 43:37.748
At my age, it's kind of stupid.

43:43.287 --> 43:45.290
It's damned hard being brave.

44:17.405 --> 44:18.327
So, anyway,

44:20.491 --> 44:24.667
I'd really prefer to work outside,
if that's okay with you.

44:35.173 --> 44:37.050
You're not good at keeping still, are you?

44:37.133 --> 44:39.636
Shoot me, then I will be still.

44:39.719 --> 44:41.562
What would be the point of shooting you?

44:42.388 --> 44:44.231
Bullets don't seem to have any effect.

44:51.597 --> 44:53.400
Goddamn. She really is a painter.

45:01.407 --> 45:04.911
The eagle is telling Sitting Bull we're here.

45:13.711 --> 45:14.963
What?

45:26.432 --> 45:28.105
You're gonna paint me now?

45:29.477 --> 45:32.276
In New York,
I draw naked people all the time.

45:33.147 --> 45:34.945
I can see without looking.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.614
So, would you take your clothes off
in front of me?

45:38.694 --> 45:41.618
- You're not a painter.
- No?

45:47.703 --> 45:51.048
I've painted a painting
for every year of my life.

45:56.837 --> 45:59.177
This was the first man
I ever killed in battle,

45:59.257 --> 46:01.430
a Crow on the Powder River.

46:03.010 --> 46:05.933
My name then was Hunkesni. It means "slow".

46:06.013 --> 46:07.014
Slow?

46:07.098 --> 46:09.066
I thought before I spoke.

46:10.893 --> 46:13.396
And on this day I became a man.

46:13.479 --> 46:15.401
You became a man by killing someone?

46:15.481 --> 46:17.950
Someone who would have killed
my mother and sister.

46:19.443 --> 46:21.787
- How old were you?
- Thirteen.

46:24.490 --> 46:26.288
This is the death of my father.

46:28.160 --> 46:30.288
And this is how I killed the man
who killed him.

46:33.165 --> 46:35.634
This is the year when the measles first came.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.338
Half our village died.

46:41.549 --> 46:43.222
Is that General Custer?

46:49.890 --> 46:53.144
I met with Tashunka Witko, Crazy Horse.

46:55.271 --> 46:58.650
We decided we needed to all be together
if we were to survive.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.155
The Hunkpapa, Oglala, Blackfeet,

47:01.235 --> 47:03.863
Minneconjou, Cheyenne, Arapaho.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.660
Crazy Horse was a religious man.

47:09.410 --> 47:13.882
He said the people needed a sign
for them to believe in their own strength.

47:16.959 --> 47:18.552
I went to seek a vision that year.

47:20.963 --> 47:22.181
This was my vision:

47:23.382 --> 47:27.103
White soldiers falling from the sky.

47:30.348 --> 47:35.195
Two days later, Long Hair, Custer,
came with his army.

47:37.646 --> 47:39.819
We didn't leave a single one of them alive.

47:43.361 --> 47:44.488
After that year,

47:46.864 --> 47:49.492
they tracked down every chief
who fought in that battle,

47:50.326 --> 47:51.498
killed them all.

47:53.245 --> 47:54.246
Except for you.

47:57.708 --> 47:58.926
So, you see?

48:00.461 --> 48:01.929
I am a painter, too.

48:04.256 --> 48:07.851
This is one of the most exquisite
pieces of work I've ever seen.

48:10.054 --> 48:11.681
Then why does it make you sad?

48:13.307 --> 48:14.980
Because you've lived all this

48:15.768 --> 48:17.691
and turned it into something beautiful.

48:21.065 --> 48:24.285
The only battle I ever fought against
is insignificance.

48:25.778 --> 48:26.996
So live more.

48:29.698 --> 48:31.075
Live more. Yes.

48:34.036 --> 48:35.413
That's what I want to do.

48:43.379 --> 48:46.349
Must have been hell to be in jail
after living like this.

48:47.550 --> 48:48.677
I was never in jail.

48:49.677 --> 48:51.520
This body full of bullets was in jail.

48:52.638 --> 48:53.730
But I was out there.

48:55.182 --> 48:56.729
The guards thought I was sleeping.

48:57.560 --> 48:59.813
But I'd made myself into an eagle.

49:21.250 --> 49:22.468
Is there something wrong?

49:26.088 --> 49:28.466
It's cold. Why are there no fires?

49:43.022 --> 49:44.945
Where is everyone?

49:45.983 --> 49:48.657
This morning at Fort Yates,
they issued copies of the new treaty.

49:50.154 --> 49:51.781
Then they announced the new winter rations.

49:53.324 --> 49:56.294
Everything's cut in half: beef, flour, sugar.

49:57.620 --> 49:58.917
They're gonna starve us into signing.

50:00.539 --> 50:02.837
When people heard the news,
they came running here asking for you,

50:04.460 --> 50:05.803
even Arapahoes and Cheyennes.

50:08.547 --> 50:09.548
The Shell King came.

50:11.217 --> 50:13.436
He asked where was Sitting Bull
when his people needed him.

50:14.386 --> 50:17.351
He said you were off with the white woman,
a government spy,

50:17.431 --> 50:20.059
who arrived on the same train
as the man who cut the rations.

50:22.686 --> 50:23.904
He said you abandoned them.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.944
When Shell King left,
most of the villagers left with him.

50:30.444 --> 50:32.037
They went off to join the ghost dance.

50:32.821 --> 50:35.449
What's... What's the ghost dance?

50:41.038 --> 50:42.751
An Indian from the south had a vision.

50:42.831 --> 50:46.505
He said if the Lakota wear certain clothes
and dance a certain dance,

50:46.585 --> 50:48.087
then the old ways would return.

50:50.756 --> 50:51.883
The buffalo will come running,

50:51.966 --> 50:54.138
scattered across the prairie,
like they used to.

50:54.218 --> 50:57.643
The Indians who died of hunger
and measles, they will return,

50:59.390 --> 51:00.937
and the white man will leave us alone.

51:02.977 --> 51:04.729
They dance until they fall.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.735
There's nothing left for them but to dance.

51:10.401 --> 51:13.075
Uncle, while you have been digging potatoes,

51:14.113 --> 51:17.288
the people have split into 100 factions.

51:19.827 --> 51:20.874
Enough.

51:22.955 --> 51:24.958
Uncle, we need you to be our leader again.

52:41.200 --> 52:43.077
Grandfather.

52:46.246 --> 52:49.625
How should we behave?

53:30.249 --> 53:33.422
Mrs. Weldon,
last night I asked the spirits for help.

53:33.502 --> 53:34.754
What did they say?

53:36.088 --> 53:40.434
They told me it was time for you
to go into town, do some shopping.

53:42.803 --> 53:44.892
People get scared when Indians dance.

53:44.972 --> 53:46.815
Dancing was scalps and war.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.772
They see dancing, they want soldiers.

53:51.353 --> 53:53.697
By the way, General Crook and McLaughlin
are having a dinner.

53:54.940 --> 53:57.068
They told me to tell you
you're invited to the party.

54:01.071 --> 54:04.995
I can only give you 32 sacks
of white flour, ma'am. That's it.

54:05.075 --> 54:06.747
The rest is earmarked for the Army.

54:06.827 --> 54:09.500
Very well, then. Thirty-two will have to do.

54:09.580 --> 54:13.754
And beans, I've only got black beans
in that quantity.

54:13.834 --> 54:18.135
Black beans is fine.
One hundred large sacks, please.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.557
And 50 barrels of molasses.

54:28.390 --> 54:29.312
All set.

54:31.477 --> 54:33.195
All right, keep 'em coming.

54:42.070 --> 54:43.409
Whoa, whoa.

54:43.489 --> 54:46.083
And this is all for
the Sioux police barracks?

54:47.201 --> 54:49.454
So, how come the white woman's paying cash?

54:52.956 --> 54:54.378
No English. Hup.

55:21.902 --> 55:22.949
Catherine Weldon.

55:49.596 --> 55:52.566
There you go, whore.
Now you're red, just like him.

56:22.796 --> 56:24.890
You'd better go. They're looking for rope.

57:15.223 --> 57:19.604
We give thanks to you for the food.

57:22.147 --> 57:24.775
Woman Walks Ahead.

57:36.036 --> 57:39.334
- Right, we all ready?
- Yeah.

57:39.414 --> 57:40.336
Good morning.

57:42.626 --> 57:44.915
Yeah, we'll see. Right.

57:50.842 --> 57:52.339
Number 21, please.

57:58.475 --> 58:01.148
Yeah, wait, she does understand

58:01.228 --> 58:04.357
that her beef and flour rations
have been cut in half, doesn't she?

58:15.283 --> 58:16.205
What did she say?

58:17.160 --> 58:19.413
She said she already has enough flour.

58:22.082 --> 58:23.528
From where?

58:27.713 --> 58:30.967
She said from the Great Spirit.

58:44.855 --> 58:45.902
General Crook.

58:47.899 --> 58:51.073
We have a problem at Standing Rock.

58:51.153 --> 58:53.116
Mrs. Weldon is buying food for the Indians,

58:53.196 --> 58:56.450
thereby... thereby undermining
the ration system.

58:59.911 --> 59:02.960
I recommend we arrest her,
keep her locked up until after the vote.

59:05.917 --> 59:08.340
Thought you said I didn't need
to worry about Sitting Bull.

59:08.420 --> 59:09.841
I was wrong. She's agitating him.

59:09.921 --> 59:11.510
She has him wearing buckskins and feathers.

59:11.590 --> 59:14.184
You can't arrest someone
for spending their own money.

59:16.011 --> 59:18.935
Sir, with all due respect, our job here

59:19.681 --> 59:21.979
is to deliver a ratification
of the Allotment Act.

59:23.518 --> 59:25.691
I bet my old friend Sitting Bull
feels about potatoes

59:25.771 --> 59:27.609
the way I feel about you, Mr. Groves.

59:27.689 --> 59:30.112
She's agitating the Bull, sir.
She's agitating him to act.

59:30.192 --> 59:32.536
No, she's a painter painting what she sees.

59:33.278 --> 59:35.451
When she sees the Bull, she sees a warrior.

59:36.364 --> 59:40.080
I, too, am a warrior.
Our destinies appear to be entwined.

59:40.160 --> 59:42.332
Sir, I fear that for some
among your regiment,

59:42.412 --> 59:44.540
this return to Dakota is about revenge.

59:44.623 --> 59:46.671
Vengeance is for the Lord to take.

59:48.543 --> 59:52.673
But maybe our good Lord sent us Mrs. Weldon.

59:52.756 --> 59:53.632
Sir...

59:53.715 --> 59:55.934
Permission to issue
an arrest warrant is denied.

01:00:07.562 --> 01:00:09.314
Do you remember who did this?

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:11.317
The whole town.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.961
I guess I really made them mad, huh?

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:34.333
The local paper...

01:00:35.590 --> 01:00:37.558
seems to have gotten the idea that...

01:00:39.427 --> 01:00:42.476
you and me are somehow
romantically connected.

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:47.026
Some joke, huh?

01:00:53.024 --> 01:00:54.401
They also think that...

01:00:57.112 --> 01:00:59.831
you and me are planning
some kind of uprising.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:04.457
Imagine.

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:08.916
A painter of a certain age
and an old potato farmer.

01:01:18.258 --> 01:01:23.060
Once, I would have taken 100 warriors
and finished that whole town.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:27.772
But I've learned to swallow it,
like swallowing rocks.

01:01:33.899 --> 01:01:37.779
If we fight, they'll massacre us all.

01:01:38.653 --> 01:01:40.405
We can fight it in an election.

01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.711
They have to put the treaty to a vote.
There won't be any need for violence.

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.171
Where are you going?

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:59.257
To get someone to saddle Rico.

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.190
Take care of her.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:41.655
Sometimes, the sadness I feel
for the passing of the old days

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:44.033
is such that I find it hard to swallow.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:49.585
The Dakota wind, the smell of buffalo
and churned-up grass,

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:53.543
smoking pine, burning fat, tobacco,

01:03:54.539 --> 01:03:58.510
Indian girls wearing cut sage,
sleeping on soft furs.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:05.134
But, you see, it is time.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:09.266
Time cannot be resisted.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:14.148
Change comes the way the rain comes.
Those days cannot return.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:20.316
But, still,

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:25.115
there are rocks inside a man
that the rain won't wash away.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.909
- Meaning what exactly?
- Meaning debts remain.

01:04:27.989 --> 01:04:29.491
You reckon you're owed something?

01:04:30.241 --> 01:04:32.289
Should we serve the soup?

01:04:32.369 --> 01:04:34.833
General Crook, since the arrival of your men,

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:39.129
I must say there's been an air of sourness
about the place.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:42.507
Yes. Because debts remain.

01:04:42.587 --> 01:04:45.807
Those beautiful days are not quite gone.
Not quite.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:49.807
Yes, Susan, why don't you bring the soup?

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:03.408
I got your invitation. Sorry I'm a bit late.

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:08.992
I have decided to help
with the democratic process.

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:10.199
What happened to you?

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:13.955
I've already written to Senator Fracks
about my presence here at the reservation.

01:05:14.035 --> 01:05:15.912
I posted the letter in Cannon Ball,

01:05:15.995 --> 01:05:20.501
where certain wild rumors about me
led to a very violent reception.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.586
Mrs. Weldon, if you have been assaulted,

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:25.091
I will take the matter up
with the police and the military.

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:27.886
I've decided to help the campaign
against the treaty.

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:32.015
I have a democratic right to do this
as part of the political process.

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:36.601
Any violent move against me
or any of the people I campaign with

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:39.397
will be reported to the Senator by wire.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.274
You really should see a doctor about that.

01:05:41.354 --> 01:05:44.028
I have been to a doctor. Good evening.

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.462
Sitting Bull.

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:10.767
He is...

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:15.230
what he thinks.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.359
This...

01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.271
is what he thinks.

01:06:25.023 --> 01:06:26.696
Sitting Bull.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.952
Maybe you should begin by
explaining what the allotment is

01:06:34.032 --> 01:06:38.003
and show them how much land
will be taken away if they agree.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.251
I can't be seen taking orders from you.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.798
Now we will have to wait.

01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:12.783
This treaty

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:15.368
is completely unjust.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:23.335
Even the Comanche and Shoshone

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:26.380
wouldn't sign it.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:48.277
How's it going?

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:52.360
These elders,
they don't care to be told what to do.

01:07:52.443 --> 01:07:53.911
How do we convince them to vote?

01:07:55.697 --> 01:07:57.916
With food. I hope it's good.

01:08:02.370 --> 01:08:04.498
This white woman cooks well.

01:08:06.124 --> 01:08:10.596
Also she's got a good body.

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:13.843
I heard she is a spy.

01:08:13.923 --> 01:08:16.142
You heard wrong.

01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.180
Can she read?

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.349
Mm-hmm.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:21.305
Has she read the treaty?

01:08:21.598 --> 01:08:27.104
She says it is plain robbery.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.104
You should be with her.

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:31.108
Okay, maybe I will be,

01:08:31.816 --> 01:08:32.987
someday.

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:40.620
Fathers, we must tell all
the people to vote...

01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.538
I say forget the vote.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:45.332
We should meet General Crook in
the red earth valley by the Powder River.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:46.413
We can ambush him

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:48.124
and cut off his...

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.629
Actually, I was hoping

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:50.836
to discuss the vote.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:52.924
What are they saying?

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:57.805
The older ones, the new ways
of resisting may take some time.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:02.514
My relatives,

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:06.397
white people are trying to take our land

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:12.658
and make us live like they do.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:18.830
If we do that we will die like the buffalo.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:24.497
The Great Spirit

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:29.800
owns the land and the sky.

01:09:31.125 --> 01:09:32.671
And that is how it's been

01:09:34.002 --> 01:09:36.926
since the beginning of time.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.939
The crowds are getting bigger every time.

01:11:23.321 --> 01:11:24.743
Getting angrier, too.

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.284
They've been angry for a long time.

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:00.904
Are we here for the night?

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:09.743
You are here for the night.

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:16.048
Where are you going?

01:12:19.043 --> 01:12:19.965
Can't you hear?

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.097
The thunder spirits have returned.

01:12:25.341 --> 01:12:27.765
I read that the thunder spirits bring war.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:34.859
They will vote for us.

01:14:01.479 --> 01:14:02.480
What's happening?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:04.657
My campaign committee.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.559
People of the Sioux Nation,

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:41.356
I declare this commission open
for submission.

01:14:43.187 --> 01:14:46.485
Let me introduce the commission's mediator,

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:48.158
Colonel Silas Groves.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.538
Good afternoon.

01:14:56.701 --> 01:14:59.999
Before I ask the General to give
his own testimony to his commission,

01:15:00.079 --> 01:15:02.126
I have a list of council elders

01:15:02.206 --> 01:15:05.710
who've all agreed to share
their opinions with us.

01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:07.796
And, to begin, I'd like to start

01:15:07.878 --> 01:15:10.506
by calling Sioux Chief Black Bear
of the Sans Arc Sioux.

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:23.653
The white people

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:26.693
have brought something good to us.

01:15:27.398 --> 01:15:31.028
We will not own the land as a group.

01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.534
Instead we will...

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:13.195
Chief Black Bear,
please carry on with your testimony.

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:22.836
He's saying that's all he has to say.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.582
Guess the cat got his tongue.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.419
Next we'll hear from, uh...

01:16:31.002 --> 01:16:33.096
Chief Yellow Hand.

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:39.808
Yellow Hand?

01:16:47.978 --> 01:16:51.232
Then can we hear from John Grass
of the Minneconjou?

01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.778
Come on, John!

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:02.079
Sir, maybe we should call this off.

01:17:02.159 --> 01:17:03.497
I thought you bribed these people.

01:17:03.577 --> 01:17:06.250
I have a list of six more chiefs
who gave me their word

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:08.333
they'd speak here today
in favor of the Allotment Act.

01:17:08.415 --> 01:17:10.212
Are any of them prepared to stand up?

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:13.046
We have a real chance here.
Maybe we should adjourn till tomorrow.

01:17:13.129 --> 01:17:16.427
- I would like to speak.
- No, you won't.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:19.430
He's not a registered member
of any tribal council.

01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:22.104
- We have the power to say no.
- Power?

01:17:26.106 --> 01:17:29.190
- You wanna speak, Bull? You go ahead.
- General.

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.819
Let the man speak, for Christ's sake.
This is a free land.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.945
What do you have to say, my old friend?

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.889
Since the white man came

01:18:01.719 --> 01:18:06.100
and broke up the grassland with his ploughs,

01:18:07.099 --> 01:18:09.313
the earth has turned to dust.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:18.697
In this dust,
there is the body of Crazy Horse...

01:18:20.696 --> 01:18:22.543
American Horse...

01:18:24.533 --> 01:18:26.322
Spotted Tail...

01:18:28.412 --> 01:18:29.750
Black Kettle...

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.753
Sword...

01:18:34.033 --> 01:18:35.547
Two Moons...

01:18:36.427 --> 01:18:38.475
Rain in the Face.

01:18:39.155 --> 01:18:41.009
When the wind blows...

01:18:43.677 --> 01:18:46.355
it blows our heroes in our faces.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.185
Our diplomats.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.933
Our doctors.

01:18:58.067 --> 01:18:59.405
Our priests.

01:19:10.704 --> 01:19:12.251
Our dead children.

01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:30.767
The Great Spirit speaks to us
in clouds of dust.

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:39.595
You cannot sell...

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.598
pieces of the earth...

01:19:46.740 --> 01:19:49.914
because the earth belongs to God.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:56.668
We must tell these people to go home...

01:19:57.710 --> 01:19:59.508
back to Washington,

01:20:00.212 --> 01:20:03.010
and not hurt the earth anymore.

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:10.059
Enough. Enough.

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:34.613
We will give no more of our land away.

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:38.175
Not even this much.

01:21:04.526 --> 01:21:06.073
Anybody else care to speak?

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:08.647
Why are you not helping me, General?

01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:11.124
- We have to adjourn.
- Adjourn?

01:21:11.450 --> 01:21:13.043
Why don't we go straight to a vote?

01:21:14.036 --> 01:21:15.833
Sir, if we vote now, they'll vote against.
You know that.

01:21:15.913 --> 01:21:17.584
It's called democracy, Colonel Groves.

01:21:17.664 --> 01:21:19.462
This is a mistake, General.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:29.805
All those in favor of the Allotment Treaty,

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:32.354
line up at the red circle.

01:21:33.889 --> 01:21:37.563
Those against it, line up at the blue.

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:50.911
What the hell are they doing?
They're handing us a victory.

01:22:03.669 --> 01:22:07.509
You don't get it, do you?
Don't you understand?

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.842
This is what the General wanted all along.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:14.347
If we lose the vote,
they'll have an excuse to go to war.

01:22:15.889 --> 01:22:18.062
And deep down,
that's what the Bull wants, too.

01:22:43.375 --> 01:22:46.299
To find our way on the open prairie,
we stop sometimes

01:22:47.796 --> 01:22:50.800
and look, remember.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:54.061
With people, too.

01:22:58.348 --> 01:23:00.521
You stop sometimes and look and remember.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:05.610
It's called <i>cantognake.</i>

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.738
To place and hold in your heart.

01:23:12.654 --> 01:23:13.655
This moment.

01:23:15.616 --> 01:23:17.038
Our power returning.

01:23:18.785 --> 01:23:19.877
Young again.

01:23:23.457 --> 01:23:24.834
Hold it in your heart.

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:29.053
You are already in my heart.

01:23:33.217 --> 01:23:34.469
So, you should know...

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:39.519
the spirits have told me
that this is the winter

01:23:40.641 --> 01:23:43.019
I'll cross over into the spirit world.

01:23:48.565 --> 01:23:51.068
No. I don't want...

01:23:52.569 --> 01:23:54.037
Don't tell me that.

01:24:01.620 --> 01:24:02.997
<i>Cantognake.</i>

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:28.696
I've finished it.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.281
Come and see.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.274
You've made me look too old.

01:25:46.892 --> 01:25:48.019
Congratulations.

01:25:49.770 --> 01:25:50.862
It's a beautiful painting.

01:25:52.189 --> 01:25:53.657
Get out of my house.

01:25:54.483 --> 01:25:56.986
I came to warn you.

01:25:58.445 --> 01:26:01.290
Tomorrow morning before dawn,

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:07.129
they will be coming to arrest you.

01:26:07.871 --> 01:26:09.168
What did he say?

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:16.389
Sedition. Intimidation of witnesses.

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:22.019
Ghost Dance religion.

01:26:24.429 --> 01:26:26.181
Doesn't really matter a damn.

01:26:30.811 --> 01:26:33.815
I remember your face.

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:41.577
We were hiding in the Killdeer mountains.

01:26:42.906 --> 01:26:44.499
It was snowing

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:50.256
when the soldiers came.

01:26:54.876 --> 01:27:01.305
Half the women and children surrendered.

01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:06.180
You gave the order to open fire.

01:27:08.432 --> 01:27:12.153
You killed them all.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:19.155
That's why I'm here.

01:27:21.445 --> 01:27:26.668
I hoped perhaps there wouldn't be
any more blood on the snow.

01:27:28.785 --> 01:27:31.664
Hoped that for once

01:27:31.747 --> 01:27:37.425
history would go in a straight line,

01:27:38.879 --> 01:27:45.347
not in a circle.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:50.684
You think I forgive you?

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:52.813
No.

01:27:52.893 --> 01:27:59.071
But if it means anything,

01:27:59.983 --> 01:28:04.614
I haven't really slept since that day.

01:28:12.579 --> 01:28:17.381
When they come for you,
they will kill her too.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:21.133
If you care about her,

01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:25.685
send her outside when the moon rises.

01:28:26.384 --> 01:28:27.351
What is it?

01:28:29.679 --> 01:28:33.024
Don't forget about our dinner
in New York City, Mrs. Weldon.

01:29:09.970 --> 01:29:12.143
Jesus, it's so quiet.
I wish a dog would bark.

01:29:18.144 --> 01:29:20.613
They really can't charge you with sedition.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:26.700
And I'm a witness
you never took part in any violence.

01:29:31.700 --> 01:29:33.168
When does the river freeze?

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:36.458
When the geese fly.

01:29:36.538 --> 01:29:39.508
We have to leave before then, or...

01:29:40.625 --> 01:29:42.923
we'll be stuck here all winter.

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:44.671
We'll leave tomorrow.

01:29:48.967 --> 01:29:52.562
And when we go to New York,
we can stay in my apartment.

01:30:16.578 --> 01:30:18.251
My parents will have a fit.

01:30:26.713 --> 01:30:29.307
There's lights in the streets now
since you've been there.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:33.930
It never really gets dark anymore.

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:41.062
Fire needs more logs.

01:30:41.770 --> 01:30:42.862
I'm warm enough.

01:30:59.496 --> 01:31:02.341
Go. The Lakota like a woman who works hard.

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:14.431
Woman Walks Ahead.

01:31:14.511 --> 01:31:16.559
Hold and keep me in your heart.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:41.046
No! No!

01:31:49.295 --> 01:31:50.342
What's happening?

01:31:51.423 --> 01:31:54.302
Corporal? Where are you going?

01:32:10.483 --> 01:32:12.781
We're off the reservation.
You're free to go. You're safe.

01:32:14.904 --> 01:32:18.329
Mrs. Wel... Mrs. Weldon,
you'll never make it!
