00:01.543 --> 00:08.175
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.887
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:14.890
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:14.973 --> 00:18.268
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.352 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.065
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.148 --> 00:24.942
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:30.072
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:39.414
<i>Hey, guys, do you like beer,</i>
<i>but can't get drunk from beer?</i>

00:39.498 --> 00:40.999
<i>Then try new Vodka Beer.</i>

00:41.083 --> 00:42.251
<i>The can says "beer,"</i>

00:42.334 --> 00:45.671
<i>but inside is 12 ounces</i>
<i>of carbonated vodka.</i>

00:45.754 --> 00:48.715
<i>And the best part is,</i>
<i>your wife will never know.</i>

00:48.799 --> 00:52.177
Honey, I'm so proud of you,
cutting down to one beer a night.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.263
Take off your underwear.

00:55.430 --> 00:57.057
She don't know.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.393
I got the mail.

00:59.476 --> 01:01.436
Hey, does an octopus live here?

01:01.520 --> 01:03.021
Peter, that says "occupant."

01:03.105 --> 01:05.440
Oh, that's too bad.
That would've been awesome.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.567
Oh, look, Peter.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.819
Here's something
from your mother's estate.

01:08.902 --> 01:11.280
Oh, looks like
they finally sold her house.

01:11.363 --> 01:14.241
And the last white domino
in that neighborhood falls.

01:14.324 --> 01:15.492
Wow, they sold it?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.537
So that means the house
and everything inside of it is gone?

01:18.620 --> 01:19.663
Oh, sweetheart.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.040
You thinking about
all the good times you had there?

01:22.124 --> 01:24.293
No, I'm thinking about
my teenage porn stash.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.961
It's still hidden in the house.

01:26.044 --> 01:29.548
Oh, okay, but I know
this is really about the memories.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.550
Lactating sluts on box springs.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.178
The-The-The special times growing up...

01:34.261 --> 01:35.721
Bikini black chicks sneezing.

01:35.804 --> 01:37.973
Lois, stop making him
reminisce about stuff.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.433
You don't understand, Lois.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.853
A boy's first collection of nudie books
and girlie movies is a sacred thing.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.981
It can't fall into a stranger's hands.
This is very serious.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.608
I'm taking us to DEFCON 4.

01:49.151 --> 01:51.236
What happens when it hits DEFCON 1?

01:51.320 --> 01:53.155
We see a dog wearing a wig.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.157
Aw, heck, let's see that anyway.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.994
<i>That's not even a lady dog.</i>

02:03.165 --> 02:05.584
Hey, Peter, what's wrong?
You've been real quiet.

02:05.667 --> 02:08.337
I don't know, Quagmire.
I keep thinking of my old pornos.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.506
It's like I'm reminded of them
everywhere I look.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.549
You've been looking at Cleveland a lot.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.760
Plus, you know, when people find that box,

02:14.843 --> 02:17.095
they won't know that, like,
for some of them magazines,

02:17.179 --> 02:18.847
I just had them as, like, a joke.

02:18.931 --> 02:21.642
You know, not 'cause, like,
I was really into it. Just the opposite.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.101
For some of them magazines.

02:23.185 --> 02:24.186
Okay.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.812
I'm going to be arrested for sure.

02:25.896 --> 02:27.773
Peter, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.609
You, Quagmire? You enjoy pornography, too?

02:30.692 --> 02:32.945
Yup, and I know
that a man's porn collection

02:33.028 --> 02:35.155
must be secured
and protected at all costs,

02:35.239 --> 02:36.615
until he gets ashamed of it

02:36.698 --> 02:38.534
and ditches it in an alley
behind a Kroger's.

02:38.617 --> 02:39.618
Hey, I know!

02:39.701 --> 02:43.288
What if we break into my old house
and steal back my big box of pornos?

02:43.372 --> 02:44.873
What do you say? You guys with me?

02:44.957 --> 02:46.208
- You bet.
- Sure thing, Peter.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.753
I mean, come on, we're a team.
Like fish and chips and fat guys.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.713
I want the double cheeseburger,

02:51.797 --> 02:54.383
but I'm gonna go healthy
and get the fish and chips.

02:54.466 --> 02:55.926
<i>Fish and chips!</i>

03:02.182 --> 03:04.017
Okay, you all remember the plan.

03:04.101 --> 03:06.395
We walk up wearing our Bill Cosby masks...

03:06.478 --> 03:08.730
Peter, that's President Obama.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.858
Oh, did I just do a racism?

03:12.025 --> 03:13.986
Hello? Can I help you gentlemen?

03:14.069 --> 03:15.320
Hi.

03:15.404 --> 03:17.197
You guys have been
sitting in front of my house

03:17.281 --> 03:19.575
for the last five hours
trying on Obama masks.

03:19.658 --> 03:21.118
Is there something I can do for you?

03:21.201 --> 03:24.705
We, uh... We-we were just getting ready
to break into your house.

03:24.788 --> 03:25.789
Excuse me?

03:25.873 --> 03:26.874
Oh, hey, cool shirt.

03:26.957 --> 03:28.667
What? Oh, thank you.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.085
Look, what's this all about?

03:30.169 --> 03:31.920
This guy used to live in your house

03:32.004 --> 03:33.755
and a box of his old porn
is still hidden in there.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.215
We were gonna break in and take it.

03:35.299 --> 03:36.800
And I was gonna stay with the rental van

03:36.884 --> 03:39.303
because it's my name
what's on the contract.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.930
Oh. Well, you could've just
knocked on the door and asked.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.433
I don't want that stuff, I've got kids.
Get it out of there!

03:44.516 --> 03:46.018
Really? Awesome!

03:46.101 --> 03:49.021
Oh, well, that was easier
than a game of Pai Gow poker.

03:49.104 --> 03:50.480
Pai gow. You lose again!

03:50.564 --> 03:51.899
That was awesome!

03:51.982 --> 03:54.109
I can't believe
these tables are always empty.

03:54.193 --> 03:55.611
- You play again?
- Nope, out of money.

03:55.694 --> 03:56.862
I'm just gonna wait for my drink.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.947
Who had the full glass of Goldschlager?

03:59.031 --> 04:02.534
Ah. Sorry, can't tip.
I'm gonna take this up to my room.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.455
Uhp, on the wrong floor.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.502
Almost time for lunch.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.086
Ah...

04:13.170 --> 04:14.838
- How was everything?
- Delicious.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.381
The prime rib was mostly fat.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.175
Should I charge it to your room?

04:18.258 --> 04:19.384
No, I had to check out

04:19.468 --> 04:21.595
even though my flight's
not until midnight.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.057
Now, how does one with no money
get to the airport?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.362
Hey, buddy, you're blocking the outlet.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.405
Oh, sorry. There was no chairs.

04:45.244 --> 04:46.703
Hi, Peter. How was Vegas?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.497
Oh, it's the best.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.046
Sweet. Now, which movie
should I start with?

04:56.922 --> 04:59.091
<i>"Back-Door Sluts 4."</i>

04:59.174 --> 05:02.761
Eh, I haven't seen the first three,
I wouldn't know what's going on.

05:02.845 --> 05:04.179
Here we go.

05:05.722 --> 05:08.892
I want to watch
all of these movies, nonstop.

05:10.978 --> 05:13.313
I don't want to watch
any more of these movies, ever.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.317
Hey, Brian, you want to go
for a ride to behind the Kroger's?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.903
- What?
- That's weird. What's that?

05:26.869 --> 05:28.954
<i>- Hello, Future Peter.</i>
- Hi.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.456
<i>By the time you watch this,</i>
<i>you'll be a grown-up,</i>

05:31.540 --> 05:34.960
<i>so I'm sure you're allowed to eat</i>
<i>ice cream and pizza for every meal.</i>

05:35.043 --> 05:36.044
You know it.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.255
<i>Also, I bet you're a big important doctor</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:41.049
<i>like that Doogie Howser kid</i>
<i>who's getting so much ass.</i>

05:41.133 --> 05:42.217
Well, I was partly right.

05:42.301 --> 05:45.137
<i>I just hope to God</i>
<i>you're not stuck in some loser job,</i>

05:45.220 --> 05:47.931
<i>like in a brewery, or a toy factory,</i>
<i>or a fishing boat.</i>

05:48.015 --> 05:49.016
Oh, boy.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.226
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>I don't have to worry</i><i>about none of that.</i>

05:51.310 --> 05:53.687
<i>I'm sure you're a big, successful doctor.</i>

05:53.770 --> 05:55.480
<i>Anyway, here's some Conway Twitty.</i>

05:55.564 --> 06:01.195
<i>I know it's only make believe...</i>

06:01.278 --> 06:03.780
This is annoying.
I don't want to sit through this.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.243
Man, I guess I ain't the big success
I thought I'd be.

06:08.327 --> 06:09.745
I know what you mean, Peter.

06:09.828 --> 06:13.498
When I was young, I thought that someday
I'd produce Upworthy web content.

06:13.582 --> 06:16.543
Am I doing it? Yes.
But not everyone is so lucky.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.378
Damn it, I suck.

06:18.462 --> 06:20.214
I've never done anything important.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.467
Well, except for when I beat
Larry Bird for a Big Mac.

06:23.550 --> 06:27.387
Off the floor, off the scoreboard,
off the backboard, no rim.

06:31.141 --> 06:34.728
Right near the basket, underhanded,
effeminate gasp, over the backboard,

06:34.811 --> 06:38.273
out of bounds, waddle over to get it,
slip on a towel, twist my ankle,

06:38.357 --> 06:39.650
go to the emergency room,

06:39.733 --> 06:42.152
doctors tell me it's not that bad
and I shouldn't have come there,

06:42.236 --> 06:45.155
I make them give me a cast anyway,
never play sports again.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.992
Hey, I won the two-dollar sandwich.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.999
<i>Highway to the danger zone...</i>

06:56.083 --> 06:59.503
Look at me. I was beautiful.

06:59.586 --> 07:01.046
What are you watching?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.298
It's just a teenage loser
who didn't realize

07:03.382 --> 07:04.842
he had no future in front of him.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.593
Well, when you're done with this,

07:06.677 --> 07:09.221
Stewie is trapped between
his crib and the wall.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.265
Help. Somebody help!

07:11.348 --> 07:13.475
He's watching an old video.

07:13.559 --> 07:15.602
Okay, when he's done then.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.646
<i>...danger zone</i>

07:17.729 --> 07:22.985
<i>Gonna take you</i>
<i>Right into the danger zone...</i>

07:23.819 --> 07:25.487
Oh, my God!

07:25.571 --> 07:28.657
He's just rhyming "danger zone"
with "danger zone."

07:29.408 --> 07:31.159
Holy crap!

07:31.243 --> 07:34.121
- Chris, I was just like you!
- What?

07:34.204 --> 07:35.205
Listen to me, Chris.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.416
I'm a failure in life,
and that's all I'll ever be.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.669
But it's not too late for you.
I won't let you go down my path.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.254
What are you saying, Dad?

07:42.337 --> 07:46.675
I'm saying, Chris, I am going to make sure
that you grow up to be a success.

07:46.758 --> 07:49.219
Yeah, I'm going to be a success!

07:49.303 --> 07:51.388
Uh, would you excuse me for a moment?

07:54.349 --> 07:56.852
Computer, what does "success" mean?

07:56.935 --> 07:59.605
Chris, let me know when you're
done with the computer.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.113
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No TV for you, Chris.

08:08.197 --> 08:10.699
TV is how stupid losers spend their time.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.534
Peter, what is this all about?

08:12.618 --> 08:16.038
I'm trying to save our son, Lois.
I don't want him to end up like me,

08:16.121 --> 08:17.497
dead-end job, crappy house,

08:17.581 --> 08:20.250
aging wife who's getting skinny
where fat's supposed to be,

08:20.334 --> 08:21.877
and fat where skinny's supposed to be.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.879
- Ha!
- Meg, go to your room.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.926
Look, Peter, I'm glad you're thinking
about Chris' future, but he's fine.

08:29.009 --> 08:31.887
- He's a perfectly normal kid.
- Are you crazy? Look at him.

08:31.970 --> 08:34.806
He's over there intentionally
giving himself a nosebleed.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.645
Yay! My nose is finally a woman!

08:41.063 --> 08:44.858
Okay, so maybe he's a little rough
around the edges, but...

08:44.942 --> 08:46.985
Oh, boy, a little got in my mouth there.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.695
Yeah, I'm gonna have to wash this shirt.

08:48.779 --> 08:51.949
Anyway, I'm going to help Chris
become a big, important success.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.660
The same way Mumford
turned his son into a success.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.662
Okay, Dad, heading out to the concert.

08:56.745 --> 08:59.581
Now, hold on a minute, son.
Where are your arm garters?

08:59.665 --> 09:01.625
Your string tie? Your woolen vest?

09:01.708 --> 09:05.337
You look nothing like a dry goods clerk
from the Garfield administration.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.923
- But, Dad...
- No buts! You're a Mumford.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.551
Now get upstairs,
put on a jaunty traveling hat,

09:10.634 --> 09:13.220
and write the same song 25 times.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.851
Okay, now, Chris,
if you want to be a success,

09:18.934 --> 09:20.894
you gotta look worldly and sophisticated.

09:20.978 --> 09:23.272
And to do that,
you got to dress like Lenny Kravitz,

09:23.355 --> 09:25.816
with little something from
every part of he world pinned on you.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.318
Leather bracelets! Nipple ring!

09:28.402 --> 09:30.153
Zippers where zippers shouldn't be!

09:30.237 --> 09:31.947
Wilma Flintstone pearl necklaces!

09:32.030 --> 09:34.074
A fur shrug with crocheted sleeves!

09:34.157 --> 09:35.200
A hat on a hat!

09:35.284 --> 09:36.743
A watch on your pinky toe!

09:36.827 --> 09:39.288
And nothing says,
"Look at me, I've been places"

09:39.371 --> 09:42.249
like two lit road flares
hanging from your sunglasses.

09:42.332 --> 09:44.251
Hey, you look like you've been places.

09:44.334 --> 09:46.795
Stop looking at me!
I do not want this attention!

09:46.879 --> 09:49.715
- Come on, Chris, let's get out of here.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.938
Uh, what are you doing?

10:05.022 --> 10:07.316
Well, I been trying to make Chris
less of a fat dummy,

10:07.399 --> 10:08.775
and nothing seems to be working,

10:08.859 --> 10:11.069
so now we're high-stepping around
in giant hats.

10:11.153 --> 10:12.613
Tip of the giant hat, sir.

10:12.696 --> 10:14.072
And to you, sir!

10:14.156 --> 10:16.283
Yes, sir, smart day to you, sir.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.577
And I thank you, sir.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.248
I scraped my knee bad!

10:23.332 --> 10:25.167
Get up, Chris,
you're embarrassing yourself.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.502
You look stupid and fat.

10:26.585 --> 10:27.669
Peter, I have to ask.

10:27.753 --> 10:30.881
Are you pushing Chris so hard
because it's what's best for him?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.217
Or are you trying to make up
for your own disappointment

10:33.300 --> 10:34.635
about how your life turned out?

10:34.718 --> 10:36.595
Brian, these are the biggest hats
I could find,

10:36.678 --> 10:38.931
so if your point is that there's
even larger ones available,

10:39.014 --> 10:40.516
I would greet that with skepticism.

10:40.599 --> 10:43.602
No, no, no, my point is that you need
to let Chris find his own path.

10:43.685 --> 10:46.021
Oh, my God, you're right, Brian.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.732
He needs to be pointed
to a very specific path.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.317
And then forced to go down it.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.486
No, no, that's-that's the opposite
of what I just said.

10:52.569 --> 10:54.363
Chris, your best chance for success

10:54.446 --> 10:56.740
is to be cultured and worldly,
like our dog.

10:56.823 --> 10:57.950
So starting right now,

10:58.033 --> 11:00.577
you gotta follow Brian around
and do everything he does.

11:00.661 --> 11:01.787
- What?
- Come on, Brian.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.081
You gotta show Chris
how to turn out better than me.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.792
I mean, you went to Brown,
you're a published author,

11:06.875 --> 11:09.169
you can hear it first
when Joe falls out of the tub.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.838
That's starting to happen more often.

11:10.921 --> 11:11.922
But I guess you're right.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.092
Maybe I am the guy to make a diamond
out of this lump of coal.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.885
But only if it's what Chris wants.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.846
- I don't care.
- All right, I'll do it.

11:18.929 --> 11:20.305
Just follow my lead, Chris.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.015
'Cause I think you could be
something great.

11:22.099 --> 11:25.102
Who knows? Maybe you'll even become
one of those mission control leaders

11:25.185 --> 11:27.521
who gets all thoughtful
while everybody's celebrating.

11:27.604 --> 11:31.024
Apollo 13, this is Mission Control,
do you copy?

11:32.401 --> 11:35.404
Apollo 13, this is Mission Control,
do you copy?

11:36.572 --> 11:38.574
Do you copy, Apollo 13?

11:40.117 --> 11:43.036
<i>Mission Control,</i><i>this is Apollo 13.</i>

11:43.120 --> 11:45.247
<i>We're all okay. Good to be home.</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:53.463
Sir, you did it!

11:53.547 --> 11:55.257
Sir, is everything okay?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.385
Eh, I bought a Nook e-reader
a couple of years ago

11:58.468 --> 12:00.554
and I'm still pissed about it.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.328
Hey. Hey.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.829
Chew that way.

13:07.913 --> 13:09.915
Eh, dinner's no fun without Chris here.

13:09.998 --> 13:12.417
There's nobody here for me
to wing my biscuit at.

13:12.501 --> 13:15.879
Well, Peter, he's been spending
an awful lot of time with Bri...

13:15.963 --> 13:18.048
Eh, it's not the same.

13:18.131 --> 13:21.385
Anyway, he and Brian have been
spending a lot of time together.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.888
Really? You're going to let that slide?
Guy throws a biscuit at you?

13:24.972 --> 13:28.016
Good evening, all.
Apologies for being so tardy.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.686
Aw, Chris, you're not tardy.
We tested you twice.

13:30.769 --> 13:33.647
There you guys are.
We were wondering about you.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.066
Brian and I have been having a blast.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.568
First we went to a symphony.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.779
Then we saw a small independent play
with real smoking in it.

13:40.863 --> 13:43.949
And then we hit the Quahog Book Festival
and went to a Q and A

13:44.032 --> 13:46.368
to ask questions that
weren't really questions.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.413
Wow, look at my sophisticated young man.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.874
You're certainly taking
to Brian's example.

13:51.957 --> 13:53.917
If anything, he's teaching me.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.961
I mean, not really, but you-you know.

13:56.044 --> 13:59.131
Aw, see, I knew Brian could put Chris
on the path to success.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.426
Hey, Chris, let's celebrate.
There's a new baby panda at the zoo.

14:02.509 --> 14:04.553
How about you and me
go chuck tater tots at it?

14:04.636 --> 14:06.722
Chuck them at Lois.
She'll just sit there and take it.

14:06.805 --> 14:07.848
Oh, Dad.

14:07.931 --> 14:11.768
That would've been fine for the old me,
but Brian and I have to be going.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.396
Oh. Okay.

14:14.479 --> 14:15.856
Yeah, we're off to see an old movie

14:15.939 --> 14:18.483
on temporary screen
in a muddy, freezing park.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.902
That sounds awful.

14:19.985 --> 14:21.320
It is awful.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.822
But at least parking will be impossible.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.032
Bye!

14:26.450 --> 14:30.621
Geez, I... Feel like I just...
Lost my son.

14:30.704 --> 14:35.542
Aw, I got a skin tag in my crack
and it stings when I don't wipe right.

14:35.626 --> 14:37.127
This has been a bad dinner.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.845
There you two are. Sit down and join us.

14:46.929 --> 14:50.474
I can't stay, Mom. Brian's showing me
all of his favorite stuff to do.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.643
Getting spooked when the furnace goes on?

14:52.726 --> 14:54.645
We're participating in an autism walk.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.271
Looks like you're doing it right now.

14:56.355 --> 14:57.731
And we may be gone a while,

14:57.814 --> 14:59.858
'cause after that
we're going down to the Civic Center.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.778
Michael Ian Black
is cocking his eyebrows for four hours.

15:02.861 --> 15:05.906
Ha! He says the things
we don't care to say.

15:05.989 --> 15:07.074
Bye!

15:08.492 --> 15:11.453
Man, I'm sick of how much time
Chris is spending with Brian.

15:11.537 --> 15:12.829
Probably smooching pickles,

15:12.913 --> 15:14.331
'cause they're a couple
of pickle smoochers.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.043
It's like he ain't even my son no more,
doing all that fancy-pants stuff.

15:18.126 --> 15:21.588
Oh, Peter, I know you miss him,
but this is what you wanted, isn't it?

15:21.672 --> 15:24.132
Well, yeah, but I didn't realize
bettering himself

15:24.216 --> 15:25.801
meant blowing off his old man.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.594
You know what? The hell with this.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.846
I want my son back.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.099
Peter, relax.
Chris is just going through a phase.

15:32.182 --> 15:33.600
He'll grow out of it.

15:33.684 --> 15:36.937
Just like you grew out
of your "Walk Like An Egyptian" phase.

15:37.855 --> 15:39.773
Paul was a good man.

15:39.857 --> 15:41.692
A good friend.

15:41.775 --> 15:46.989
I'll... I'll always remember
how supportive he was when...

15:47.072 --> 15:48.615
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

15:48.699 --> 15:50.534
I can't-I can't... I can't do this.

15:58.709 --> 16:02.588
Check it out, Lois. When Chris notices
that "World's Greatest Son" mug I made,

16:02.671 --> 16:05.174
he'll be back on board
with his old man in no time.

16:05.257 --> 16:06.675
Hey, Chris, what's on the mug?

16:06.758 --> 16:09.261
"World's Greatest Sun."

16:09.344 --> 16:11.555
This world only has one sun.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.308
What kind of idiot made this mug?

16:17.936 --> 16:20.230
<i>When everything's made to be broken</i>

16:21.440 --> 16:25.736
<i>I just want you to know who I am.</i>

16:29.031 --> 16:31.742
<i>It might seems crazy</i>
<i>What I'm about to say...</i>

16:34.244 --> 16:36.496
I'm very easily influenced by music.

16:39.625 --> 16:42.544
All right, Chris, now I know
you're all sophisticated now,

16:42.628 --> 16:44.922
but no man can resist the siren call

16:45.005 --> 16:47.633
of mentally impaired supermodel
Kate Upton.

16:47.716 --> 16:51.595
Mm, sorry, Dad.
I'm more of a Catherine Keener man now.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.890
But, Chris, you got to take advantage.
The clock's ticking on Kate Upton.

16:54.973 --> 16:57.267
- She's almost at the end of her window.

16:57.351 --> 16:58.769
- Yup, we missed it.

16:58.852 --> 17:00.229
Come on, get out of here.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.030
Sorry, Lois, I need the TV.

17:10.113 --> 17:11.532
I gotta win my son back.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.325
What are you talking about, Peter?

17:13.408 --> 17:16.954
Well, you know how Brian's got Chris
watching all them fancy foreign films now?

17:17.037 --> 17:21.208
Well, I figure I can lure Chris in
with this French movie... <i>Le Rocqué Trois.</i>

17:25.504 --> 17:28.590
- <i>Rocqué!</i>
- <i>Adrienne!</i>

17:28.674 --> 17:30.843
<i>- Rocqué!</i>
<i>- Adrienne!</i>

17:30.926 --> 17:32.678
<i>J'pité le fool.</i>

17:32.761 --> 17:34.888
<i>Oh, Clubbert Lange!</i>

17:34.972 --> 17:36.557
Peter, this is pointless.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.810
You wanted Chris to be a better person
with a bright future,

17:39.893 --> 17:42.604
and thanks to Brian,
that's what he has now.

17:42.688 --> 17:45.315
Yeah, but, I don't even
recognize Chris these days.

17:45.399 --> 17:47.359
And I never get to spend time with him.

17:47.442 --> 17:49.444
It's like Chris ain't my friend no more.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.954
Thanks for coming
to the book club meeting, everyone.

17:59.037 --> 18:01.999
Well, I gotta say,
I loved this week's book...

18:02.082 --> 18:03.959
Annie Proulx's <i>The Shipping News.</i>

18:04.042 --> 18:05.586
Yes, yes! Yes.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.504
Very <i>Portnoy's Complaint.</i>

18:07.588 --> 18:10.465
Uh, I don't...
What, uh, what do you mean by that?

18:10.549 --> 18:14.469
Oh, you know, just with...
The-the port, and the shipping.

18:14.553 --> 18:16.430
And of course, in <i>Portnoy's Complaint</i>

18:16.513 --> 18:19.016
you've got the guy
who's living near the water...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.893
That doesn't sound right.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.478
...and he hated the noise
from the local port,

18:23.562 --> 18:28.192
so he filed one of the very first
port noise complaints in maritime law.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.902
And for those of us
who read the complaints,

18:29.985 --> 18:31.778
trust me, they were very warranted.

18:31.862 --> 18:33.780
Brian, could I talk to you over here?

18:33.864 --> 18:35.657
Oh, let's dog-ear this for a sec.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.452
This one gets it.

18:39.203 --> 18:41.163
Brian, what the hell
are you talking about?

18:41.246 --> 18:43.457
You clearly haven't read
either of those books.

18:43.540 --> 18:46.126
Whoa, Chris, now you're starting
to sound like Mark Twain,

18:46.210 --> 18:47.961
whose real name was Samuel Clemens.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.005
Oh, that is so your go-to!

18:50.088 --> 18:51.340
I can't believe you.

18:51.423 --> 18:54.092
I thought you were this worldly,
sophisticated guy,

18:54.176 --> 18:56.929
but you're just a fraud... Like Moses.

18:57.012 --> 18:59.139
And the Lord's Eleventh Commandment...

18:59.223 --> 19:01.934
"Moses gets to be first in line
at the buffet."

19:02.017 --> 19:04.019
What? Oh, seriously?

19:04.102 --> 19:07.606
I know, you guys, it's so lame,
but that's what it says.

19:18.617 --> 19:19.952
Why are you doing that?

19:20.035 --> 19:22.412
Why are you hucking tater tots
at a baby panda?

19:22.496 --> 19:25.165
'Cause I'm oddly attracted to him
and it frightens me.

19:25.249 --> 19:27.543
See, this is why you're so great, Dad.

19:27.626 --> 19:29.920
You don't pretend
to be someone you're not.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.965
You do what you want,
and you don't care what anyone thinks.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.967
Well, I-I care what you think.

19:35.050 --> 19:38.512
Look, Chris, you're my kid,
and I want what's best for you,

19:38.595 --> 19:42.724
but I guess I just don't want you
to become too good for your old man.

19:42.808 --> 19:43.809
Don't worry, Dad.

19:43.892 --> 19:46.937
I could never be too good for you
because you're the best.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.398
And I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

19:49.481 --> 19:52.985
Really? Aw, thanks, Chris.

19:53.068 --> 19:54.069
Tater tot?

19:57.072 --> 19:58.657
- It's fun, right?
- Yeah!

19:58.740 --> 20:01.326
And the mama panda
doesn't do anything about it

20:01.410 --> 20:04.079
because she was blinded
to make her more submissive.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.372
Ha-ha! You're right.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.291
You know, Chris, all this started

20:07.374 --> 20:09.751
'cause I was feeling bad
about being a failure.

20:09.835 --> 20:12.421
But you know what? I got you for a son.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.798
So maybe I did something right.

20:14.882 --> 20:16.508
I love you, Dad.

20:20.554 --> 20:21.555
Come on, Chris.

20:21.638 --> 20:25.017
Let's go get an $18 Coke
at the terrible zoo restaurant.

20:25.100 --> 20:28.228
Yay! Sticky tables covered in bees!

20:33.317 --> 20:35.277
<i>Coming up, we'll tell you where to look</i>

20:35.360 --> 20:37.487
<i>when talking to a coworker</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

20:37.571 --> 20:38.906
<i>The answer might surprise you.</i>

20:38.989 --> 20:41.200
Well, I think we all learned
something today.

20:41.283 --> 20:42.951
<i>In other news, TVs still make noise,</i>

20:43.035 --> 20:44.703
<i>even when people</i>
<i>resume their conversations.</i>

20:44.786 --> 20:46.496
<i>- Yes, studies have determined...</i>
- That's right, Peter.

20:46.580 --> 20:49.291
- And it's the most important lesson.

20:49.374 --> 20:52.711
Everyone should be who they are.
Success is being true to yourself.

20:52.794 --> 20:54.588
- Amen, Mom.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.341
But to have the love of your family,
that's true success.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.675
Let's go ahead and turn off the TV.

20:58.759 --> 20:59.885
<i>There we go.</i>
