- Are you okay?

00:15.416 --> 00:16.650

00:18.186 --> 00:19.653
We have, uh,
George Stephanopoulos.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.222
He's gonna be talking
about the election.

00:21.255 --> 00:22.690
We have Mario Batali.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.492
- Ooh.

00:24.525 --> 00:25.793
No wonder she's wearing makeup.

00:25.826 --> 00:28.162
- Okay.
- Why is she wearing makeup?

00:28.196 --> 00:30.131
I don't understand
what's happening.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.166
- Well, she used to have
a thing for Mario Batali

00:32.200 --> 00:33.567
and probably still does.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.636
- Okay, we both enjoy
cured meats, okay?

00:35.669 --> 00:37.538

00:39.607 --> 00:42.476
You guys ever, uh, think about,
you know?

00:42.510 --> 00:45.213
- I've seen her looking.
I'm not interested.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.647
- The feeling is mutual, Grady.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.216
- Great.

00:48.249 --> 00:50.751
- Also, we have
a female comedian.

00:50.784 --> 00:52.653
Yes, Aparna Nancherla
is on tonight.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.322
She's gonna do a set.

Guys, FYI,

00:56.224 --> 00:58.459
I'm expanding
my producing duties,

00:58.492 --> 01:00.494
and I'm gonna be doing
the Aparna Nancherla

01:00.528 --> 01:01.595
segment tonight, so--

01:01.629 --> 01:02.830
- Says who?

01:02.863 --> 01:05.599
- Uh, me,
uh, Jimmy.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.136
I ran the idea by him last night
at the Knicks game.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.404
He's down.
- Uh, what's the idea, Todd?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.573
- Oh, my buddy Nate,
uh, he's dating Aparna,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.542
and he wants to propose to her
live on TV,

01:14.575 --> 01:17.378
and Jimmy's like,
"Whoa, that sweeps gold, baby.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.113
That sweeps gold!"

01:19.147 --> 01:21.649
I was like, "What is that?"

01:21.682 --> 01:24.518
What is that, seriously?
Are you okay?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.854
- I'm fine.
- You got to take a dump.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.422

01:31.292 --> 01:32.860
- No, Todd.
- No, Todd.

become slang for making a poop?

to you for a second?

aspirin from the first aid kit,

02:13.901 --> 02:16.370
but I'm very hungover
right now.

02:16.404 --> 02:20.374
- I think I'm being
recruited by ISIS.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.576
- Oh, not here.
Come in the sound room.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.815
Look, how do you know it's ISIS

02:27.848 --> 02:30.684
and not Al-Qaeda
or the Taliban or Boko Haram?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.220
- How would I know
the difference?

02:32.253 --> 02:34.322
- Did you receive
any weird text messages

02:34.355 --> 02:35.889
with numbers and emojis?

02:35.923 --> 02:37.325
- No.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.260
Somebody from
the Almi Kabeeb Network

02:39.293 --> 02:41.329
called and asked me
to interview for a job.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.597

a private conversation.

- Got it.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.743
What are we talking about?

02:55.776 --> 02:58.512
- I'm being recruited
by ISIS.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.681
- Oh, my God,
that's terrifying.

03:00.714 --> 03:01.982
- Look, this sound fishy.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.451
You don't seem like
the type of person

03:03.484 --> 03:04.885
that anybody would
want to hire.

03:04.918 --> 03:05.886
- Right?
- Right?

03:05.919 --> 03:06.987
Okay.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.756
- But they do prey
on the weak.

03:08.789 --> 03:10.291
- They say they want me

03:10.324 --> 03:12.426
to help out with
their social media efforts.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.696
- I follow a lot of terrorist
groups on social media,

03:15.729 --> 03:17.731
and they're actually
pretty funny,

03:17.765 --> 03:20.334
but they're not as good
as the Fat Jew.

He's hilarious.

want you to end up

on the back of a pickup truck
in a training camp in Yemen.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.942
- I have a 4:00 p.m.
Skype interview.

03:28.976 --> 03:32.280
- If they let you know
about any attacks coming up,

03:32.313 --> 03:33.914

05:58.025 --> 06:00.093
she does just
the right amount of grip.

to do it, though?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.715
On TV,
in front of people?

07:27.748 --> 07:28.782

we can do.

We have to do it now.

07:30.150 --> 07:31.151

on something?

how to proceed.

by ISIS and in the same way.

you're very susceptible

Remember that cult you joined,

you had joined a cult?

my Messianic maiden family.

network

11:11.304 --> 11:14.842
wants to have a Skype interview
with me about a producing job,

11:14.875 --> 11:16.744

seem legit at all.

you have to worry about this.

all that angry or isolated.

- With ISIS.
- I'm sorry?

you work with ISIS.

more like a movement,

11:55.015 --> 11:57.918

an apocalyptic cult.

from the inside.

a lot of work.

16:17.077 --> 16:19.679
- Phil, this is
the ladies' room.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.081
- I know.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.649
I got a call
about a disturbance.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.752
Someone said they could smell
a dead animal.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.655
- Ugh, how are you even
breathing in this room?

16:28.688 --> 16:29.756
[gags]

16:29.789 --> 16:33.060
- Hey, checking on my girl.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.261
Are you empty yet?

16:34.294 --> 16:37.030
- Hi, Mario.
I'm all good.

16:37.064 --> 16:39.066
Are you okay
with your segment?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.534
- Oh, great.
Penny's been fantastic.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.036
- Oh, thank you, Mario.

16:43.070 --> 16:45.105
- Shh.
- What?

16:45.138 --> 16:46.673
- I think I hear scratching.

16:46.706 --> 16:49.442
Mario, you know a lot
about dead animals.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.244
What would you say
this scent is?

16:51.278 --> 16:53.046
- I don't think it's anything
of a dead animal.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.714
I think it's Staci
and her IBS.

16:54.747 --> 16:57.584
- Oh, right.
[laughs]

16:57.617 --> 17:00.620
I can't believe
I forgot you have IBS.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.755
Everybody always talks about it.

17:02.789 --> 17:04.724
Well, don't you worry, Staci.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.393
I'm gonna get on the intercom

17:06.426 --> 17:08.128
and announce
to the entire office

17:08.161 --> 17:09.829
that this is nothing
to worry about,

17:09.862 --> 17:13.366
that this smell is just you
in here on the shitter.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.335
Actually, we don't have
an intercom.

17:15.368 --> 17:16.836
You know what I'll do is I'll
just go around to every desk

17:16.869 --> 17:18.805
and tell everyone face-to-face.

17:18.838 --> 17:20.707
- Okay, get out, get out,
get out, save yourselves.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.709
- Ahh!
- Everyone, come on.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.377
- Didn't you two
used to be an item?

17:24.411 --> 17:26.246
- Yeah,
I dodged that bullet.

17:26.279 --> 17:27.247
- Whew.

17:27.280 --> 17:31.118
[audience laughing]

17:31.151 --> 17:33.153
- Oh, great job, guys.
[laughs]

17:33.186 --> 17:34.287
That was awesome.

17:34.321 --> 17:36.223
- What the hell, man?
- What?

17:36.256 --> 17:37.357
- Did you know
that was gonna happen?

17:37.390 --> 17:38.391
- What, the whole dump thing?

17:38.425 --> 17:39.492
- Yeah, the whole dump thing

17:39.526 --> 17:41.528
where I got dumped
on national TV.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.197
- Yeah, totally, yeah,
but you did a great job, man.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.665
Good acting.
- I wasn't acting.

17:45.698 --> 17:47.434
That actually
was happening to me.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.636
- Wow. Well, you banged
a stripper, bro, so--

17:49.669 --> 17:51.604
- First of all, it doesn't
count as cheating

17:51.638 --> 17:52.639
if you pay for it.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.374
It's a business transaction.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.575
- Oh, yeah, 'cause
there's money involved?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.444
- Yes.
- Well, someone found out.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.778
She wasn't happy about that,
because you put your wingwong

17:58.811 --> 18:00.280
in someone else's toast.

18:00.313 --> 18:01.648
- Wait, wingwong in toast?

18:01.681 --> 18:02.849
You know what? I'm gonna--

18:02.882 --> 18:04.851
I'm gonna go apologize
to Aparna.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.154
- Oh, that's probably not
a good idea, 'cause you know,

18:07.187 --> 18:08.655
newly single,

18:08.688 --> 18:10.523
she's right in
Jimmy's limo,

18:10.557 --> 18:11.791
and they're going
to dinner town.

18:11.824 --> 18:13.426
- Dinner town?

18:13.460 --> 18:15.628
- She's going right to
dinner town eating food.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.497
- Wait, they're gonna
have sex?

18:17.530 --> 18:19.166
- Well, no--
yeah, well,

18:19.199 --> 18:20.233
you know, dinner town.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.834
[moans]
Mm.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.337
- Wait, are they gonna eat
or are they gonna have sex?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.673
- [moans] Mm.
- Are they--

18:26.706 --> 18:28.375
I can't--
you're saying two things.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.243
- Dinner town, bro.
- Dinner town.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.645
- They're going to dinner town.
- Okay, explain to me what you--

18:32.679 --> 18:34.881
say what you just said without
using the word "dinner town."

18:34.914 --> 18:37.484
- Sure. They're gonna go,
"Oh," and then "Uh."

18:37.517 --> 18:39.419
- Okay, no sounds,
no dinner town,

18:39.452 --> 18:41.654
no sounds, just words.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.556
No, I need words,
not silence.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.824
Just give me words.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.559
I need words.
That's how I communicate.

18:46.593 --> 18:49.262
- All right, they're gonna--
eh!

18:49.296 --> 18:51.831
- I don't even know
what's happening right now.

18:56.303 --> 18:58.271
- Well, thank you once again
for reaching out,

18:58.305 --> 19:01.474
and like I said earlier,
we would literally do anything

19:01.508 --> 19:03.643
to have you be the face
of our network.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.478
- Listen, I'm really flattered
by your interest,

19:05.512 --> 19:06.813
but I got to tell you,
I'm under contract.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.915
You'd have to buy me out.

19:08.948 --> 19:13.220
- To be clear, George,
we have oil money.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.388
- I'm listening.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.724
