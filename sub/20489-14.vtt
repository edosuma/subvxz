00:13.572 --> 00:16.378
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS ADAM
GUY IS GOING TO DO WITH ME?

00:16.378 --> 00:18.381
YOU WORRIED HE'S GOING
TO GET RID OF YOU THE SECOND

00:18.381 --> 00:21.188
HE FINDS OUT ALL
YOU CAN DO IS DEFOLIATE?

00:21.188 --> 00:22.792
SEE, RIGHT THERE.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.394
YOU'VE NEVER RESPECTED
MY BOTANICAL THING.

00:24.394 --> 00:27.604
YOU SHOULD...

00:28.004 --> 00:29.608
NEVER MIND.

00:42.838 --> 00:44.041
COME ON, SKEET.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.446
WHAT WAS IT YOU
WERE GOING TO TELL ME?

00:46.446 --> 00:48.051
CHARLOTTE, DON'T.

00:58.473 --> 01:00.079
THIS FRIED RICE SUCKS!

01:03.285 --> 01:05.691
I'M SO SICK OF THIS TAKEOUT!

01:15.312 --> 01:17.718
I HATE IT WHEN
YOU DO THAT TO ME.

01:24.533 --> 01:27.340
LOOK AT THIS MESS.

01:27.340 --> 01:33.755
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THIS IS FINISHED,
THAT'S IT: I'M ON MY OWN.

01:37.363 --> 01:38.966
HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON?

01:38.966 --> 01:40.169
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?

01:47.385 --> 01:48.990
OW!

01:57.008 --> 01:59.814
OW! GET OFF! GET OFF!

02:18.257 --> 02:19.058
COME WITH ME.

02:19.459 --> 02:20.661
ADAM'S WAITING ON THE ROOF.

02:23.468 --> 02:24.670
ARGH, COME ON.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.275
ALL I DO IS KILL PLANTS.

02:26.275 --> 02:27.878
NOT EVEN BIG PLANTS.

03:41.279 --> 03:42.081
THEY GOT THE OTHER ONE.

03:42.481 --> 03:43.283
COULDN'T GET THEM BOTH.

03:43.684 --> 03:44.888
HELLO, ADAM.

03:44.888 --> 03:46.090
CHARLOTTE.

03:46.090 --> 03:47.693
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

03:47.693 --> 03:48.896
WHY?

03:48.896 --> 03:51.303
WERE YOU WORRIED ABOUT ME?

03:51.303 --> 03:52.504
NO.

03:52.504 --> 03:54.509
I'M JUST VERY GLAD THAT
YOU DECIDED TO CONTACT US.

03:54.509 --> 03:56.113
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU.

03:56.514 --> 03:58.118
OH, I KNOW.

03:58.118 --> 04:01.726
IT WAS THAT TIME THAT YOU,
ME, AND DAD WENT TO DINNER.

04:01.726 --> 04:03.731
THIRTEEN YEARS AGO.

04:04.131 --> 04:06.537
YEAH. AND RIGHT AFTER
THAT MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED...

04:06.537 --> 04:08.943
THANKS TO YOU.

04:20.168 --> 04:21.370
WELL, THIS IS IT.

04:21.370 --> 04:22.974
WELCOME.

04:22.974 --> 04:26.182
I WAS HOPING I'D GET TO
SEE WHERE YOU GUYS WORKED.

04:26.182 --> 04:28.587
IT'S JUST POLICY, CHARLOTTE.

04:28.587 --> 04:30.192
THIS IS JESSE.

04:31.393 --> 04:33.398
SO IT'S NOT BECAUSE YOU
THOUGHT I WAS LIKE MY FATHER.

04:33.398 --> 04:35.402
YOUR FATHER AND I WORKED
TOGETHER A LONG TIME

04:35.402 --> 04:37.007
AND I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

04:37.007 --> 04:38.208
YEAH, YEAH.

04:38.610 --> 04:39.813
THAT'S ALRIGHT.

04:39.813 --> 04:41.416
IT'S ALL JUST HISTORY.

04:41.416 --> 04:45.025
I'M MORE
INTERESTED IN NOW.

04:45.025 --> 04:47.831
I CONTACTED YOU BECAUSE I
WANT TO JOIN UP WITH YOU GUYS.

04:47.831 --> 04:49.835
WELL, I'M SORRY.

04:50.237 --> 04:51.839
THAT'S JUST
NOT POSSIBLE.

04:51.839 --> 04:53.843
I COULD
REALLY HELP YOU.

04:53.843 --> 04:55.049
WELL THAT'S
NOT THE ISSUE.

04:55.448 --> 04:57.053
I KNOW YOU'RE
VERY GIFTED

04:57.053 --> 04:59.057
YOU HAVE THE
RARE NUCLEOTIDE SEQUENCING
ON STRAND 17 OF YOUR...

04:59.057 --> 05:00.260
YEAH, I CHANGE PEOPLE.

05:00.260 --> 05:01.864
TURN BAD PEOPLE GOOD.

05:01.864 --> 05:03.467
YEAH, I NOW.

05:03.467 --> 05:05.072
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

05:05.072 --> 05:07.077
WELL WE'VE BEEN FILE ON
ALL THE CHILDREN OF GENOMEX.

05:07.077 --> 05:09.079
SO YOU KNOW
HOW VALUABLE I'D BE.

05:09.079 --> 05:10.284
TELL HIM.

05:10.682 --> 05:12.687
ADAM?

05:12.687 --> 05:15.894
COME ON, ADAM, DON'T YOU
THINK YOU OWE THIS TO ME?

05:21.508 --> 05:24.314
HEY, BRENNAN, HOW WELL
DOES ADAM KNOW CHARLOTTE?

05:24.314 --> 05:26.319
WELL, SHALIMAR SAID THAT
ADAM WORKED FOR THEIR FATHER

05:26.319 --> 05:28.323
AT THE BIOCHEMISTRY
DEPARTMENT AT STANFORD.

05:28.323 --> 05:29.927
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

05:39.950 --> 05:41.955
I THINK THERE'S A
LITTLE MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

05:41.955 --> 05:43.158
WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:43.557 --> 05:45.162
HER FATHER WAS ANTHONY COOKE.

05:45.162 --> 05:47.167
THE GUY THAT WAS CONVICTED
FOR SELLING BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.

05:47.167 --> 05:48.369
YES.

05:48.369 --> 05:49.972
AND IT WAS ADAM
WHO TURNED HIM IN.

05:49.972 --> 05:51.976
WOW, CHARLOTTE CAN'T
BE TOO FOND OF ADAM.

05:51.976 --> 05:53.981
WELL, IT GETS WORSE.

05:53.981 --> 05:55.586
COOKE COMMITTED SUICIDE
RIGHT BEFORE THE TRIAL.

05:55.985 --> 05:57.590
THAT'S ROUGH.

05:57.590 --> 05:59.595
WHAT'S HER NEW MUTANCY?

05:59.595 --> 06:02.000
SHE CAN MANIPULATE
MORAL POLARITY.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.005
BAD TO GOOD,
OR GOOD TO BAD?

06:04.406 --> 06:07.213
MY GUESS IS SHE
COULD GO EITHER WAY.

06:20.442 --> 06:22.447
DEFOLIATION.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.055
IT'S NO BIG DEAL IN
THE CITY, OF COURSE, BUT...

06:26.055 --> 06:28.862
TELL ME
ABOUT CHARLOTTE COOKE.

06:28.862 --> 06:32.470
WE HUNG AROUND
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

06:32.470 --> 06:35.279
SHE WAS PRETTY HOT, BUT...

06:35.279 --> 06:36.479
I WAS THE ONLY ONE...

06:36.479 --> 06:38.484
JUST TELL HIM ABOUT THE GIRL.

06:38.884 --> 06:41.291
SHE WAS ALWAYS KIND OF WEIRD.

06:41.691 --> 06:45.301
IT USED TO BOTHER HER THAT NO
ONE WOULD HANG AROUND WITH HER.

06:45.301 --> 06:47.304
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT STUFF
ABOUT HER FATHER CAME OUT.

06:47.304 --> 06:48.507
THAT WAS... SHOCKING.

06:48.507 --> 06:50.512
WHY DID SHE CONTACT MUTANT X?

06:50.512 --> 06:53.317
SHE HATES THIS ADAM GUY.

06:53.317 --> 06:55.323
SHE... CHARLOTTE
FIGURES THAT IF...

06:55.323 --> 06:58.128
ADAM
WANTS HER TO JOIN MUTANT X,
SHE CAN HE RUIN HIS LIFE...

06:58.128 --> 07:02.539
LIKE HE DID WITH HERS.

07:02.539 --> 07:06.148
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY
THAT MISS COOKE DOES?

07:06.547 --> 07:09.355
WHAT'S IN IT
FOR ME IF I TELL YOU?

07:16.572 --> 07:18.576
IT CAN WAIT.

07:22.986 --> 07:25.792
SHE... SHE...
SHE CAN CHANGE PEOPLE.

07:25.792 --> 07:28.197
SHE... SHE... SHE MAKES THEM...

07:28.598 --> 07:29.802
SHE CAN MAKE THEM BAD.

07:29.802 --> 07:31.806
IT ONLY LASTS A
MINUTE ON NEW MUTANTS...

07:31.806 --> 07:33.009
BUT ON...

07:33.009 --> 07:35.013
YOU KNOW, REAL PEOPLE
IT CAN LAST FOREVER.

07:35.013 --> 07:39.424
A NEW MUTANT
WITH THE ABILITY TO
ADJUST THE MORAL COMPASS.

07:45.838 --> 07:48.644
SHOW THE
YOUNG MAN HIS ROOM.

07:57.064 --> 07:59.870
OKAY, WE'RE READY TO GO.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.474
GOOD.

08:01.474 --> 08:05.483
ALRIGHT, CHARLOTTE, HERE'S
THE TELEPHONE NUMBER WHERE

08:05.483 --> 08:07.086
YOU CAN REACH ME.

08:07.489 --> 08:10.293
NOW YOUR CALL WILL
BE FORWARDED TO ME FROM
ONE OF THE SAFE-HOUSES.

08:10.293 --> 08:16.306
I DIDN'T CONTACT YOU SO YOU
COULD STICK ME IN UNDERGROUND.

08:16.306 --> 08:19.113
CHARLOTTE,
THE GSA KNOW ABOUT YOU.

08:19.113 --> 08:21.118
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.

08:21.520 --> 08:23.122
WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO KEEP YOU SAFE, CHARLOTTE.

08:23.524 --> 08:26.330
I CONTACTED YOU BECAUSE I WANT
TO JOIN MUTANT X.

08:26.330 --> 08:29.939
ALRIGHT. LOOK,
CHARLOTTE, I'M VERY SORRY,

08:30.340 --> 08:32.746
BUT YOU CAN'T
JUST JOIN MUTANT X.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.349
FINE.

08:37.154 --> 08:39.962
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU WANT IT...

08:39.962 --> 08:41.965
THEN THAT'S THE
WAY IT'S GOT TO BE.

08:53.191 --> 08:54.796
ADAM, WHERE DOES IT
SAY THAT YOU GET TO MAKE

08:54.796 --> 08:57.201
THE DECISIONS FOR EVERYBODY?

08:57.201 --> 08:58.806
WHAT?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.409
JESSE, ARE YOU OKAY?

09:00.409 --> 09:02.412
WAS I TALKING TO YOU?

09:02.412 --> 09:03.215
HEY, WOAH...

09:03.616 --> 09:04.819
HEY, DON'T USE
THAT TONE ON ME, ADAM.

09:04.819 --> 09:06.823
I'VE HAD IT!

09:06.823 --> 09:10.030
AND I'VE HAD IT WITH
YOUR ATTITUDE TOO JESSE.

09:10.030 --> 09:11.634
ARGH...

09:11.634 --> 09:12.838
HEY, HEY!

09:23.261 --> 09:24.462
WAIT!

09:34.887 --> 09:37.293
HEY! STOP IT YOU TWO.

09:42.905 --> 09:44.509
SHALIMAR.

09:44.509 --> 09:46.914
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

09:47.315 --> 09:48.517
YEAH.

09:48.517 --> 09:49.722
IT MUST HAVE
BEEN CHARLOTTE.

09:49.722 --> 09:50.522
I'M SORRY.

09:50.522 --> 09:52.127
CHARLOTTE?

09:52.127 --> 09:53.730
CHARLOTTE?!

09:55.333 --> 09:56.937
SHE'S GONE.

10:04.657 --> 10:07.461
OUR SOURCES TELL US CHARLOTTE
COOKE IS BACK ON THE STREETS.

10:07.461 --> 10:08.666
QUELLE SURPRISE.

10:09.065 --> 10:10.269
HER PLAN TO BRING
DOWN ADAM HAS FAILED.

10:10.669 --> 10:12.272
I THINK WE
COULD MAKE USE OF MISS
COOKE'S TALENTS AND

10:12.272 --> 10:13.877
ACHIEVE OUR OWN GOALS.

10:13.877 --> 10:15.480
WELL, FROM WHAT I UNDERSTOOD
FROM OUR LITTLE FRIEND

10:15.881 --> 10:17.483
MR VOSBURG, SHE'S
A TRIFLE UNSTABLE.

10:17.483 --> 10:19.488
SHE'LL NEED PROPER
TRAINING AND GUIDANCE.

10:19.488 --> 10:23.900
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
YOU'D LIKE TO BECOME
HER MENTOR, MR. LYNCH?

10:23.900 --> 10:25.903
I AM.

10:26.305 --> 10:28.309
SHE'S YOUR
RESPONSIBILITY.

10:28.309 --> 10:29.912
IF SHE
FAILS, YOU FAIL.

10:30.314 --> 10:33.923
EXTEND AN IMMEDIATE
INVITATION TO MISS COOKE.

10:34.322 --> 10:36.327
WE'RE TRYING
TO LOCATE HER NOW.

10:36.327 --> 10:40.336
MIGHT I OFFER A PIECE OF MY
OWN ADVICE: MISS COOKE IS A

10:40.336 --> 10:43.544
WOUNDED ANIMAL; YOU MUST TRY
TO CONVINCE HER THAT WE ARE

10:43.946 --> 10:45.950
HER COLLABORATORS,
NOT HER CAPTORS.

10:46.350 --> 10:49.959
IN HER MIND,
ADAM IS RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER FATHER'S DEATH.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.963
SHE WANT REVENGE.

10:51.963 --> 10:53.969
YOU MUST HARNESS THIS ENERGY.

10:53.969 --> 10:55.571
IT'S PRICELESS.

11:02.788 --> 11:05.192
OH GOOD,
THERE'S NO RESIDUAL DAMAGE.

11:05.595 --> 11:08.401
BUT I HAVE TO DO A
MORE COMPLETE TOXIC SCAN.

11:08.401 --> 11:12.410
I WAS COMPLETELY OUT OF CONTROL.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.216
I COULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.024
OR HE COULD HAVE KILLED YOU.

11:18.024 --> 11:20.830
NOT LIKELY.

11:20.830 --> 11:23.635
WELL, LUCKILY FOR BOTH OF YOU
THE TOXIN WORE OFF WHEN IT DID.

11:23.635 --> 11:27.243
SO WHAT ARE WE GOING
TO DO IF WE FIND HER AGAIN?

11:27.243 --> 11:29.249
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:29.249 --> 11:31.253
I MEAN, WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO WITH HER?

11:31.253 --> 11:33.659
ARE YOU GOING
TO PUT HER IN SOME KIND OF
STASIS AND KEEP HER HERE?

11:33.659 --> 11:35.263
NO.

11:35.263 --> 11:36.867
CAN'T DO THAT TO HER.

11:37.267 --> 11:39.271
I'M THE ONE
THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

11:39.271 --> 11:40.474
NO YOU'RE NOT.

11:40.876 --> 11:42.478
IT WAS HER FATHER
WHO RUINED HER LIFE.

11:42.478 --> 11:43.682
NOT YOU.

11:43.682 --> 11:44.885
WELL, THAT'S NOT
THE WAY SHE SEES IT.

11:44.885 --> 11:46.488
EXACTLY.
SHE'S BLAMING YOU FOR THIS.

11:46.488 --> 11:47.690
BUT IF YOU HADN'T
STOPPED HER DAD,

11:47.690 --> 11:49.294
WHO KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPENED.

11:49.294 --> 11:50.497
SHALIMAR, I HAVE TO HELP HER.

11:50.899 --> 11:52.101
THERE'S NO ONE
ELSE WHO CAN DO IT.

11:52.101 --> 11:53.304
OKAY.

11:53.304 --> 11:54.907
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT THE SAME CHARLOTTE?

11:55.309 --> 11:57.313
BECAUSE YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT THE LITTLE
GIRL THAT YOU USED TO KNOW.

11:57.313 --> 11:59.318
I'M THINKING ABOUT THE
WOMAN WHO ALMOST GOT US KILLED.

11:59.717 --> 12:02.124
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO JOIN MUTANT X,

12:02.124 --> 12:04.529
SHE WANTED TO
INFILTRATE MUTANT X...

12:04.529 --> 12:07.737
AND TURN US ALL AGAINST
EACH OTHER, AND AGAINST YOU.

12:07.737 --> 12:10.141
ALRIGHT, SO WHAT
ARE YOU SUGGESTING?

12:10.141 --> 12:11.745
I'M SUGGESTING IF YOU
INSIST ON GOING AFTER HER,

12:11.745 --> 12:13.750
YOU WATCH YOUR BACK.

12:14.953 --> 12:15.754
ADAM?

12:15.754 --> 12:17.359
YEAH, JESSE.

12:17.359 --> 12:18.964
I GOT A LEAD.

12:18.964 --> 12:20.967
CHARLOTTE WAS SEEN A HALF HOUR
AGO IN THE GARMENT DISTRICT.

12:20.967 --> 12:22.170
GOOD, CHECK IT OUT.

12:22.170 --> 12:23.372
GREAT.

12:23.773 --> 12:24.976
SHALIMAR,
ARE YOU OKAY?

12:24.976 --> 12:26.581
ALRIGHT.

12:26.581 --> 12:28.584
BUT I WANT A REMATCH.

12:28.584 --> 12:29.787
WELL, YOU ALREADY KICKED MY ASS.

12:29.787 --> 12:31.392
NO CHANCE YOU'RE
GETTING A SECOND SHOT.

12:42.615 --> 12:45.824
WELL, THERE'S
DEFINITELY NOTHING HERE
CHARLOTTE'LL COME BACK FOR.

12:45.824 --> 12:48.230
WELL, THEY WERE VERY
INTERNATIONAL WITH THEIR TASTES:

12:48.230 --> 12:51.437
THAI,
MIDDLE EASTERN... DELI.

12:51.437 --> 12:55.446
WOO, THAT'S GOING
TO LIMIT THE SEARCH.

13:13.086 --> 13:14.291
WHAT ARE YOU SEEING?

13:14.689 --> 13:17.496
A ROOFTOP.

13:17.496 --> 13:20.303
SOME PLACE SHE
WENT TO FEEL SAFE.

13:20.703 --> 13:22.708
JESSE'S UP IN THE DOUBLE HELIX.

13:23.109 --> 13:24.711
HE CAN SCAN FROM UP THERE.

13:24.711 --> 13:26.718
I THINK HE'LL NEED
A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION.

13:26.718 --> 13:28.320
THEY STOPPED BUILDING IT.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.524
WHAT?

13:29.524 --> 13:31.929
SHE'S LOOKING OUT
ON SOMETHING UNFINISHED:

13:31.929 --> 13:33.132
CONCRETE, STEEL...

13:33.533 --> 13:35.938
A PARKING LOT.

13:35.938 --> 13:37.943
HAPPEN TO CATCH
A STREET SIGN?

13:37.943 --> 13:41.551
LET'S RUN IN WHAT WE'VE GOT TO
ADAM, HE CAN RUN A DATA SEARCH.

13:47.966 --> 13:49.570
SHE LOVES THE
KUNG PAO LUNCH SPECIAL,

13:49.970 --> 13:51.174
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S KEEPING HER.

13:54.381 --> 13:55.983
MAYBE SHE'S IN THE
RESTROOM, WE JUST MISSED HER.

13:55.983 --> 13:57.186
YOU'RE WASTING MY TIME.

13:57.588 --> 13:58.390
OKAY. NO, DON'T.

13:58.390 --> 13:59.992
I... I KNOW
WHERE SHE IS.

13:59.992 --> 14:01.196
IT'S LIKE FIVE
MINUTES FROM HERE.

14:01.196 --> 14:02.799
YOU BETTER BE RIGHT.

14:02.799 --> 14:05.606
OR YOU'LL BE CALL THAT
STASIS POD HOME SWEET HOME.

14:11.620 --> 14:13.625
EVANS CONTRACTING
HAD AN INVESTOR PULL OUT,

14:13.625 --> 14:15.630
SHUT DOWN
CONSTRUCTION A YEAR AGO.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.632
IT'S ON ASH STREET, RIGHT
NEAR CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT.

14:18.034 --> 14:19.638
I'VE GOT IT, ADAM.

14:19.638 --> 14:21.643
BRENNAN AND
EMMA ARE A BLOCK AWAY.

14:29.260 --> 14:30.463
HEY, CHARLOTTE.

14:30.865 --> 14:32.868
WHO ARE YOU?

14:32.868 --> 14:34.873
FRIENDS OF ADAM'S.

14:34.873 --> 14:38.079
YEAH, I'M FINISHED
TALKING TO YOU GUYS.

14:38.481 --> 14:39.683
WATCH OUT.

14:39.683 --> 14:41.688
YOU'RE AFRAID OF ME?

14:41.688 --> 14:44.496
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE
THE BEST ADAM COULD FIND.

14:44.496 --> 14:46.098
YOU KNOW, THE GSA IS
STILL LOOKING FOR YOU.

14:46.098 --> 14:47.701
REALLY?

14:47.701 --> 14:49.307
YOU DON'T WANT TO
GO WITH THEM, CHARLOTTE.

14:49.307 --> 14:51.712
THEY'RE GOING
TO USE YOU UP,

14:51.712 --> 14:53.315
AND THEY'RE GOING
TO THROW YOU AWAY.

14:53.315 --> 14:55.319
AND THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU
GUYS ARE GOING TO DO.

14:55.319 --> 14:56.924
WE KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
WITH YOUR FATHER.

14:56.924 --> 15:00.129
DID ADAM TELL
YOU THE WHOLE STORY?

15:00.129 --> 15:03.738
DID ADAM TELL YOU HOW EVERYONE
AT SCHOOL TREATED ME LIKE I

15:03.738 --> 15:05.743
WAS THE ONE THAT DID IT?

15:05.743 --> 15:07.748
THEY SAID THEY WERE
GLAD MY FATHER WAS DEAD,

15:07.748 --> 15:10.956
AND THAT I SHOULD
KILL MYSELF TOO.

15:10.956 --> 15:14.964
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS
LIKE TO GROW UP HAVING EVERYONE

15:14.964 --> 15:17.771
HATE YOU FOR SOMETHING
THAT YOU NEVER DID?

15:18.171 --> 15:19.775
WE'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOU, CHARLOTTE.

15:19.775 --> 15:20.977
ADAM...

15:20.977 --> 15:22.981
I DON'T CARE WHAT ADAM WANTS.

15:22.981 --> 15:24.587
YOU GUYS ARE TOO LATE.

15:24.587 --> 15:26.591
ALL OF YOU ARE TOO LATE.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.199
SEE, I TOLD YOU SHE'D BE HERE.

15:31.001 --> 15:32.604
CHARLOTTE, COME ON!

16:29.936 --> 16:31.540
THEY GOT CHARLOTTE.

17:03.747 --> 17:04.948
HI.

17:05.351 --> 17:06.551
YOU KNOW,
THE MINUTE I GOT HERE,

17:06.551 --> 17:08.156
I KNEW THIS
WAS THE PLACE FOR YOU.

17:08.156 --> 17:09.760
DO YOU EXPECT
ME TO BELIEVE THAT?

17:09.760 --> 17:11.763
LISTEN, I HAD NO CHOICE.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.769
YOU'RE SUCH A WEASEL.

17:13.769 --> 17:16.976
YOU'D DO ANYTHING
TO SAVE YOUR OWN SKIN.

17:16.976 --> 17:18.179
WOULD YOU LISTEN TO ME?

17:18.579 --> 17:21.787
THE...
THE GSA WANT TO GET RID
OF ADAM, JUST LIKE YOU.

17:21.787 --> 17:23.791
REALLY?

17:24.192 --> 17:25.396
YEAH, THAT'S
WHY THEY WANT YOU:

17:25.797 --> 17:26.999
TO... TO HELP THEM.

17:26.999 --> 17:30.207
THEY WANT ME?

17:30.207 --> 17:31.809
ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:31.809 --> 17:34.217
CHARLOTTE,
YOU BELONG HERE.

17:34.217 --> 17:36.220
I MEAN,
YOU CAN REALLY, REALLY
FIT IN WITH THESE PEOPLE.

17:36.220 --> 17:39.829
MISS COOKE, MR. ECKHART
WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU.

17:39.829 --> 17:41.833
I'M A LITTLE TIED UP RIGHT NOW.

17:41.833 --> 17:44.641
WE DON'T OFTEN COME
ACROSS NEW MUTANTS LIKE YOU.

17:44.641 --> 17:50.252
WE THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
THE RIGHT STUFF FOR THE GSA.

17:50.252 --> 17:52.256
THAT'S JUST WHAT I WAS JUST...

17:52.256 --> 17:54.261
WE KNOW WHAT ADAM
DID TO YOUR FATHER.

17:54.663 --> 17:56.667
HE COULD HAVE HANDLED
THE SITUATION QUIETLY,

17:56.667 --> 17:58.671
BETWEEN COLLEAGUES.

17:58.671 --> 18:01.478
BUT HE HAD TO GO PUBLIC.

18:01.478 --> 18:04.685
HE HAD TO
SATISFY HIS OWN EGO.

18:05.087 --> 18:10.299
WE NEED YOUR
HELP TO STOP ADAM BEFORE HE
RUINS MORE PEOPLE'S LIVES.

18:15.912 --> 18:18.316
DON'T OFFER
TOO MUCH UP FRONT.

18:18.316 --> 18:19.921
I KNOW, I KNOW.

18:20.321 --> 18:21.926
LET HIM
DO THE TALKING.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.529
HE LIKES TO COME
UP WITH THE IDEAS HIMSELF.

18:23.930 --> 18:25.534
SPEAK WHEN YOU'RE SPOKEN TO.

18:25.534 --> 18:27.137
WHO THE HELL DOES
THIS GUY THINK HE IS?

18:27.539 --> 18:29.544
LET'S GET
SOMETHING STRAIGHT
RIGHT NOW, CHARLOTTE:

18:29.544 --> 18:31.146
YOU'VE GOT RAW TALENT,
AND THAT'S ALL YOU'VE GOT.

18:31.547 --> 18:33.952
I CONVINCED ECKHART
TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE.

18:33.952 --> 18:36.359
DON'T MAKE ME LOOK BAD.

18:36.758 --> 18:38.362
AM I UNDERSTOOD?

18:38.362 --> 18:40.768
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN.

19:03.220 --> 19:07.630
MR. LYNCH HERE HAS
THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE IN
YOUR ABILITIES, MISS COOKE.

19:07.630 --> 19:09.232
I'M AFRAID I DO NOT.

19:09.232 --> 19:10.437
SIR?

19:10.837 --> 19:13.242
I REALIZE I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A
BIT HASTY IN AGREEING TO THIS.

19:13.242 --> 19:15.649
PLEASE DON'T UNDERESTIMATE
ME, MR. ECKHART.

19:21.662 --> 19:23.666
BUT I'M WILLING
TO BE CONVINCED.

19:31.283 --> 19:32.886
REMOVE HER RESTRAINTS.

19:32.886 --> 19:34.090
HOLD ON.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.094
THIS SHOULD BE
A CONTROLLED EXPERIMENT.

20:01.753 --> 20:03.757
HOW'RE YOU
FEELING, MR. LYNCH?

20:19.794 --> 20:21.799
DID YOU KNOW HE WAS PRONE
TO THOSE KINDS OF BEHAVIOUR

20:21.799 --> 20:23.403
BEFORE YOU HIRED HIM?

20:23.403 --> 20:25.807
NICELY DONE, MISS COOKE.

20:31.421 --> 20:33.425
THAT'S QUITE ENOUGH. MR. LYNCH.

20:36.633 --> 20:39.439
OH, IT'LL WEAR OFF IN
ABOUT FIVE MORE SECONDS...

20:39.840 --> 20:42.246
ON NEW MUTANTS.

20:42.646 --> 20:47.457
AND ON NORMAL --
EXCUSE ME -- NON-NEW MUTANTS?

20:47.457 --> 20:51.067
I ONLY TESTED IT ONCE BEFORE.

20:51.067 --> 20:53.071
AND?

20:53.071 --> 20:55.477
WELL,
IT SEEMS TO LAST FOREVER.

20:55.477 --> 20:57.481
REALLY?

21:03.494 --> 21:05.499
ALRIGHT, MISS COOKE,
I'M CONVINCED.

21:05.900 --> 21:08.305
WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

21:11.513 --> 21:12.314
ADAM?

21:12.314 --> 21:13.919
ADAM, IT'S CHARLOTTE.

21:13.919 --> 21:17.125
UM, I NEED YOUR HELP,
AND I HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

21:17.125 --> 21:19.130
CHARLOTTE, THIS IS EMMA.

21:19.130 --> 21:21.936
EMMA, I ESCAPED FROM
GENOMEX, IT WAS HORRIBLE.

21:22.338 --> 21:23.540
WHERE IS SHE?

21:23.941 --> 21:25.145
IS THAT ADAM?

21:25.145 --> 21:26.347
CHARLOTTE,
WHERE ARE YOU?

21:26.747 --> 21:28.352
I'M...
I'M AT MY APARTMENT.

21:28.352 --> 21:29.553
ALRIGHT, YOU
STAY RIGHT THERE.

21:29.553 --> 21:30.757
I'M ON MY WAY.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.761
NO ONE ESCAPES FROM GENOMEX.

21:32.761 --> 21:33.964
YOU CAN'T TRUST HER.

21:33.964 --> 21:34.766
EMMA.

21:35.167 --> 21:37.572
LOOK, AT LEAST
LET ME COME WITH YOU.

21:37.572 --> 21:39.175
TOO DANGEROUS,
NOT GOING TO HAVE ANYONE
ELSE EXPOSED TO THAT TOXIN.

21:39.576 --> 21:41.179
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO PROTECT
YOURSELF AGAINST THE TOXIN?

21:41.581 --> 21:42.784
BECAUSE SHE WOULDN'T
DO THAT TO ME.

21:42.784 --> 21:43.987
SHE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY
BEFORE, AND SHE DIDN'T DO IT.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.590
JUST THINK ABOUT
IT FOR A MINUTE.

21:45.590 --> 21:47.195
WHY
WOULD SHE COME RUNNING
BACK TO US FOR HELP?

21:47.195 --> 21:48.797
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S
SEEN WHAT LIFE WOULD
BE LIKE FOR HER THERE.

21:49.199 --> 21:50.402
THAT'S WHAT
SHE WANT YOU TO THINK.

21:50.402 --> 21:51.204
ALRIGHT, LOOK.

21:51.603 --> 21:53.609
IF IT'S A TRAP,
I'LL DEAL WITH IT ALONE.

21:59.622 --> 22:02.430
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT WHAT
I DID BEFORE, TO YOUR FRIENDS.

22:02.430 --> 22:04.434
THAT'S ALRIGHT. I UNDERSTAND.

22:04.434 --> 22:05.636
NO, YOU DON'T.

22:06.038 --> 22:08.042
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW
MUCH I HATED YOU.

22:08.042 --> 22:10.047
I... I JUST...

22:10.447 --> 22:11.649
I NEEDED SOMEONE
ELSE TO BLAME.

22:12.052 --> 22:14.056
SOMEBODY OTHER
THAN MY FATHER.

22:14.056 --> 22:15.659
YOUR FATHER
LOVED YOU VERY MUCH.

22:15.659 --> 22:18.065
YEAH,
HE WAS WEAK, THAT'S ALL.

22:18.065 --> 22:22.074
WELL, IF I KNEW WHAT HE
WAS GETTING HIMSELF INTO...

22:22.074 --> 22:24.078
YOU WOULD
HAVE STOPPED HIM.

22:24.078 --> 22:27.287
I'M SO SORRY
FOR HATING YOU.

22:27.287 --> 22:28.888
PLEASE FORGIVE...

22:31.695 --> 22:33.700
OH MY GOD.

22:34.101 --> 22:36.507
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

22:36.907 --> 22:38.510
YOU'RE JUST LIKE THEM.

22:38.510 --> 22:42.120
CHARLOTTE,
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

22:42.120 --> 22:44.125
I WANT ANOTHER CHANCE.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.327
PUT ME IN
THE UNDERGROUND.

22:45.728 --> 22:47.332
I WANT TO GO IN THE UNDERGROUND.

22:47.732 --> 22:49.336
ALRIGHT.

22:49.336 --> 22:50.939
HOW DID YOU
ESCAPE FROM GENOMEX?

22:50.939 --> 22:52.944
THE WAY I ALWAYS DO.

22:53.346 --> 22:55.350
I USED MY POWERS.

22:55.752 --> 22:58.557
I DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT ANY MORE.

22:58.557 --> 23:01.363
I...
I'M ASKING FOR HELP.

23:01.363 --> 23:03.770
ALL MY LIFE
EVERYBODY JUST...

23:03.770 --> 23:07.378
WON'T EVEN TOUCH ME,
THEY'RE AFRAID OF ME.

23:07.378 --> 23:09.381
AND YOU ARE TOO.

23:09.381 --> 23:10.985
YOU...

23:10.985 --> 23:12.990
I'M SORRY.

23:12.990 --> 23:14.593
NO, NO. NO.

23:14.593 --> 23:15.797
I'M... I'M SO SORRY.

23:15.797 --> 23:16.999
I JUST...

23:16.999 --> 23:18.203
I'M SORRY FOR THE
WAY THINGS TURNED OUT.

23:18.602 --> 23:19.404
I'M SORRY THAT I...

23:19.805 --> 23:21.009
I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE FOR YOU.

23:21.009 --> 23:22.212
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

23:23.415 --> 23:25.017
ADAM.

23:25.017 --> 23:26.219
EMMA?

23:32.234 --> 23:35.441
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO WITH YOU?

23:35.441 --> 23:36.644
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

23:37.045 --> 23:38.248
YEAH, I'M FINE.

23:38.248 --> 23:39.451
OF COURSE HE'S ALRIGHT.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.455
HE CAME TO HELP ME.

23:41.455 --> 23:43.860
SHE'S GOING TO BE FINE.

23:44.262 --> 23:47.470
THANKS FOR COMING BY.

23:52.681 --> 23:55.889
VERY CLEVER OF YOU TO PLAY
ON MY GUILT LIKE THAT.

23:56.290 --> 23:59.497
SO I'LL SEE YOU AT GENOMEX?

24:03.104 --> 24:04.709
SURE.

24:04.709 --> 24:07.113
RIGHT NOW I GOT THINGS
I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF.

24:15.132 --> 24:17.939
SHALIMAR, CHARLOTTE'S
GOTTEN TO EMMA.

24:17.939 --> 24:19.140
THE TWO OF THEM HEADED OUT.

24:19.543 --> 24:20.745
CHARLOTTE TOOK OFF.

24:20.745 --> 24:23.150
WELL WHAT ABOUT
EMMA, IS SHE OKAY?

24:23.150 --> 24:24.755
THE TOXIN SEEMS TO HAVE
DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON PSIONICS.

24:25.154 --> 24:26.759
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:27.159 --> 24:29.565
LISTEN, I NEED
YOU TO PREPARE THE LAB FOR
A NEURAL RESYSTEMIZATION.

24:29.966 --> 24:31.167
IT'S OUR ONLY CHANCE.

24:31.167 --> 24:32.772
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

24:39.187 --> 24:41.592
POOR LITTLE EMMA.

24:41.592 --> 24:44.800
BY THE TIME I'M DONE WITH
YOU, YOU WON'T KNOW YOURSELF.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.962
SHALIMAR, I NEED THE FILES
ON BRAIN RESYSTEMIZATION.

24:56.962 --> 25:00.569
I NEED TO KNOW MY
OPTIONS IN CASE THE CRANIAL
NERVES ARE AFFECTED.

25:00.569 --> 25:02.574
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO HER?

25:02.976 --> 25:04.579
I'M TRYING TO SAVE
WHAT'S LEFT OF HER MIND.

25:04.579 --> 25:06.183
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:06.183 --> 25:08.187
THE TOXIN'S SPREADING
THROUGH HER CEREBRAL CORTEX.

25:08.187 --> 25:10.591
I NEED TO CAUTERIZE IT
BEFORE IT SPREADS ANY FURTHER.

25:10.591 --> 25:11.795
IS SHE GOING TO BE OKAY?

25:12.196 --> 25:15.003
I'M HOPING THAT
THIS PROCEDURE WILL HELP
PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE.

25:15.003 --> 25:19.012
UNTIL I DO THE WORK, I WON'T
KNOW WHAT'S ALREADY BEEN LOST.

25:19.012 --> 25:21.418
AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS HARD
ON US, BUT WE NEED TO PUT OUR

25:21.819 --> 25:23.422
FEELINGS BEHIND US.

25:23.422 --> 25:25.027
I NEED YOU TWO TO
GO OUT AND FIND CHARLOTTE.

25:25.027 --> 25:27.031
WHAT GOOD IS THAT
GOING TO DO NOW?

25:27.031 --> 25:29.436
WELL, MAYBE SHE'LL
KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE
TOXIN THAT WE DON'T KNOW.

25:29.436 --> 25:31.841
AND YOU, I NEED THOSE FILES NOW.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.105
ADAM?

26:00.306 --> 26:01.508
I'M... I'M FINE.

26:01.508 --> 26:03.113
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

26:11.532 --> 26:12.734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

26:13.136 --> 26:15.140
DON'T TELL ME
WHAT I NEED TO DO.

26:15.140 --> 26:16.744
SHE GOT TO
YOU, DIDN'T SHE?

26:16.744 --> 26:18.348
CHARLOTTE DID THIS TO YOU.

26:18.348 --> 26:19.951
ADAM, LOOK AT ME.

26:19.951 --> 26:21.955
ADAM, STOP IT.

26:33.182 --> 26:37.592
IN A LITTLE WHILE, NOTHING
MUCH WILL MATTER ANYMORE.

26:46.813 --> 26:48.817
I WAS THINKING MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

26:48.817 --> 26:50.020
WHAT?

26:50.020 --> 26:51.624
THEY'RE...
THEY'RE MAKING YOU A GSAGENT.

26:52.025 --> 26:53.227
YOU'VE GOT THE
LOOK AND EVERYTHING.

26:53.227 --> 26:54.430
AREN'T YOU PROUD?

26:54.430 --> 26:55.633
I DON'T KNOW.

26:56.033 --> 26:57.237
IT'S WEIRD.

26:57.637 --> 27:01.247
I'VE NEVER CHANGED
ANYONE SO POWERFUL BEFORE.

27:01.247 --> 27:02.848
OH YEAH.

27:02.848 --> 27:06.056
YOU TOOK A REALLY REALLY GOOD
GUY AND YOU TURNED HIM AND...

27:06.056 --> 27:08.061
NOW HE'S EVERYONE'S
WORST NIGHTMARE.

27:08.061 --> 27:10.065
I... I DON'T THINK HE'S
GOING TO BOUNCE BACK FROM IT.

27:12.871 --> 27:15.679
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

27:16.079 --> 27:17.684
OW!

27:17.684 --> 27:19.688
GET OFF!

27:19.688 --> 27:21.692
OW!

27:21.692 --> 27:24.499
WHAT WAS THAT?

27:24.499 --> 27:26.904
THAT WAS A SUBDERMAL GOVERNOR.

27:26.904 --> 27:30.512
TO PREVENT
YOU FROM ACCESSING YOUR
POWERS EXCEPT WHEN I SAY SO.

27:30.512 --> 27:33.719
YOU DON'T FEEL SO POWERFUL
ANYMORE, DO YOU, CHARLOTTE?

27:33.719 --> 27:37.328
THANK YOU
FOR HOLDING CHARLOTTE'S
ATTENTION, MR. VOSBURG.

27:40.133 --> 27:41.338
I'VE CHANGED MY MIND.

27:41.738 --> 27:42.940
I WANT TO LEAVE NOW.

27:42.940 --> 27:44.545
GIVE ME MY STUFF.

27:44.545 --> 27:45.747
GIVE ME MY BOOTS.

27:45.747 --> 27:47.351
I WANT TO LEAVE.

27:47.351 --> 27:50.558
WELL, I'M SORRY MISS COOKE,
BUT THAT'S JUST NOT AN OPTION.

28:03.788 --> 28:06.996
NOW WE'VE ALL
COME FULL CIRCLE.

28:06.996 --> 28:09.802
YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK AT ADAM
FOR WHAT HE DID TO YOUR FATHER,

28:09.802 --> 28:12.207
AND DONE US A GREAT
SERVICE AT THE SAME TIME.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.613
SO HOW DOES IT FEEL?

28:14.613 --> 28:18.623
OKAY, I GUESS.

28:18.623 --> 28:22.632
AND DO I DETECT A CONSCIENCE?

28:22.632 --> 28:26.239
YOUR FATHER EXHIBITED
THE SAME TENDENCIES...

28:26.640 --> 28:30.649
UNTIL I CONVINCED
HIM HE HAD NO CHOICE BUT
TO SELL ME HIS RESEARCH.

28:31.051 --> 28:33.054
MY FATHER?

28:33.457 --> 28:35.461
I WORKED HARD TO CONVINCE HIM.

28:35.862 --> 28:40.673
THE MONEY, IN THE END,
WAS HIS ACHILLES' HEEL.

28:40.673 --> 28:44.281
WELCOME TO THE GSA, MISS COOKE.

28:57.110 --> 28:59.517
WHERE'S THAT
FERAL WITH MY FILES?

29:01.920 --> 29:03.925
THEN AGAIN, MAYBE PRECISION
ISN'T EXACTLY WHAT'S CALLED FOR

29:03.925 --> 29:07.133
RIGHT NOW, IS IT, MY LITTLE
MIND-BENDING FREAK OF NATURE?

29:07.534 --> 29:09.939
ADAM?

29:12.345 --> 29:14.752
I KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

29:20.765 --> 29:22.769
EXCUSE ME A MOMENT.

29:23.972 --> 29:25.174
CHARLOTTE GOT TO ADAM.

29:25.174 --> 29:26.377
I NEED BOTH
OF YOU BACK HERE NOW.

29:26.778 --> 29:27.980
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

29:28.783 --> 29:30.386
SHALIMAR.

29:31.590 --> 29:33.193
SHALIMAR...

29:33.594 --> 29:36.802
IT'S YOU SHE
GOT TO ADAM, NOT EMMA.

29:36.802 --> 29:38.404
NOT LIKELY.

29:52.437 --> 29:54.841
WRONG WAY.

29:58.851 --> 30:00.856
HELLO, SHALIMAR.

30:03.260 --> 30:04.866
YOU CAN'T HIDE FROM ME, ADAM.

30:05.265 --> 30:07.270
I'LL FIND YOU, YOU KNOW I WILL.

30:15.288 --> 30:17.694
CHARLOTTE TURNED YOU, ADAM.

30:17.694 --> 30:19.699
YOU'VE GOT HER
TOXIN INSIDE OF YOU.

30:21.704 --> 30:24.109
LOOK, ADAM, WHAT YOU'RE FEELING
RIGHT NOW, IT ISN'T REAL.

30:32.929 --> 30:35.735
THAT IS JUST A
LITTLE SOMETHING TO SOOTHE
THE SAVAGE BEAST IN YOU.

30:55.381 --> 30:56.582
STAY BACK.

30:56.582 --> 30:57.385
SHAL', ARE YOU OKAY?

30:57.785 --> 30:58.587
SHALIMAR.

30:58.587 --> 31:00.592
DON'T COME IN HERE.

31:10.213 --> 31:12.220
I WOULDN'T DO
THAT IF I WERE YOU.

31:12.220 --> 31:15.024
YOU HIT THE FOR FORCEFIELD
WITH THAT AND IT'LL REBOUND.

31:15.024 --> 31:17.030
AND YOU,
MY FRIEND, WILL FRY.

31:17.432 --> 31:19.436
ADAM... JESSE...

31:19.436 --> 31:21.441
WELL, NOW, YOU JUST SAW WHAT
HAPPENED WHEN YOU TRIED TO

31:21.441 --> 31:23.444
PHASE, BUT GO AHEAD,
MASS OUT IF YOU WANT,

31:23.444 --> 31:25.048
IT'S KIND OF POINTLESS...

31:25.048 --> 31:28.656
I DESIGNED
THIS LITTLE FORCEFIELD
WITH ALL OF YOU IN MIND.

31:30.661 --> 31:33.469
DOWNLOAD NEW MUTANT
DATABASE TO DISK,

31:33.469 --> 31:36.274
INCLUDING ALL CURRENT
ADDRESSES AND ALIASES.

31:36.274 --> 31:37.878
ADAM!

31:37.878 --> 31:39.884
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

31:39.884 --> 31:43.090
WATCH ME.

31:47.901 --> 31:49.906
SHALIMAR... I TOLD
YOU NOT TO COME IN HERE.

31:49.906 --> 31:51.509
COME ON.

31:51.911 --> 31:53.112
WE SAW
YOU LYING THERE.

31:53.514 --> 31:54.716
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS A TRAP.

31:54.716 --> 31:55.918
NO, SHE'S RIGHT.

31:55.918 --> 31:57.522
WE SHOULD
HAVE BEEN WAY
AHEAD OF HIM.

31:57.922 --> 31:59.526
I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN AS SOON AS
HE BROUGHT EMMA IN HERE.

31:59.526 --> 32:01.131
IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

32:01.131 --> 32:02.734
WHAT ABOUT EMMA?

32:02.734 --> 32:04.338
SHE'S STILL IN THE LAB.

32:04.739 --> 32:06.744
HE HASN'T
OPERATED ON HER YET.

32:06.744 --> 32:08.347
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT
OF HERE AND TAKE HIM DOWN.

32:08.347 --> 32:09.951
YEAH, HOW ARE
WE GOING TO DO THAT?

32:09.951 --> 32:11.554
HE KNOWS ALL
OF OUR WEAKNESSES.

32:11.554 --> 32:13.559
HE'S THE ONE WHO TAUGHT
US HOW TO CONTROL OUR POWERS.

32:13.559 --> 32:15.163
HE'S ONLY EVER FOUGHT
US IN TRAINING EXERCISES,

32:15.163 --> 32:16.365
NEVER FOR REAL.

32:16.766 --> 32:18.370
YEAH, WELL WE
CAN'T JUST FIGHT HIM.

32:18.370 --> 32:20.775
WE HAVE TO TURN HIM BACK.

32:21.178 --> 32:23.181
ADAM'S GOT
THE NAMES AND ADDRESSES
OF NEW MUTANTS ON A DISK,

32:23.181 --> 32:25.586
AND I'M PRETTY DAMN SURE THAT
I KNOW WHERE HE'S GOING WITH IT.

32:25.988 --> 32:27.993
SO WE SHOULD BETTER JUST
HOPE THAT WE GET A CHANCE TO GET

32:27.993 --> 32:29.996
OUT THERE AND STOP HIM.

32:29.996 --> 32:31.600
DAMN.

34:14.936 --> 34:16.541
EMMA,
YOU GOT OUT!

34:16.541 --> 34:18.545
EMMA, GET US OUT OF HERE.

34:18.944 --> 34:20.549
ADAM LOCKED US IN.

34:22.954 --> 34:26.161
SANCTUARY,
DEACTIVATE FORCE FIELD.

34:26.161 --> 34:28.969
VALTUUTUS, OKAA HYVA.

34:28.969 --> 34:30.172
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

34:30.572 --> 34:32.176
YOU DON'T THINK
WE TRIED THAT ALREADY?

34:32.176 --> 34:33.378
ADAM REPROGRAMMED IT YOU KNOW,

34:33.378 --> 34:35.384
I CAN MAYBE TRY TO TALK YOU
THROUGH CRACKING THAT, BUT...

34:35.384 --> 34:37.789
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE
THAT LANGUAGE?

34:37.789 --> 34:39.393
IT'S FINNISH.

34:39.393 --> 34:41.397
ADAM DOESN'T REALIZE I
DATED AN EXCHANGE STUDENT FROM

34:41.397 --> 34:44.605
HELSINKI IN HIGH SCHOOL.

34:44.605 --> 34:47.811
TURVAPAIKKA,
PUDOTTA SUOJAKILPIT.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.623
MAYBE ADAM DID KNOW.

34:53.024 --> 34:54.226
IT'S NOT LIKE HIM
TO SCREW UP LIKE THAT.

34:54.627 --> 34:56.231
YOU THINK SOME PART
OF HIM'S FIGHTING WHAT
CHARLOTTE DID TO HIM?

34:56.231 --> 34:57.835
WELL, WE BETTER HOPE
THAT HE SCREWS UP AGAIN,

34:57.835 --> 34:59.037
OR WE'RE ALL HISTORY.

35:05.453 --> 35:07.056
ADAM.

35:07.457 --> 35:09.462
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

35:09.462 --> 35:12.669
YOUR SECURITY PEOPLE DIDN'T
SEEM VERY SURPRISED TO SEE ME.

35:15.875 --> 35:18.281
NICE TO BE BACK?

35:18.281 --> 35:20.688
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

35:20.688 --> 35:23.494
THIS IS A COMPLETE LIST OF
ALL THE CHILDREN OF GENOMEX.

35:23.894 --> 35:27.503
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WAS WONDERING, HOW
WOULD I FIT IN HERE?

35:27.903 --> 35:31.111
I MEAN, I'M A
LEADER, NOT A FOLLOWER.

35:31.111 --> 35:36.322
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
OF MYSELF AS A TEAM PLAYER.

35:36.322 --> 35:38.728
A TEAM PLAYER.

35:38.728 --> 35:39.931
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

35:40.331 --> 35:41.536
NO,
THAT'S VERY GOOD.

35:41.536 --> 35:43.540
BUT, OF COURSE, WE BOTH
KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE.

35:43.540 --> 35:45.545
YOU'D HAVE ME IN STASIS
IN, WHAT, THIRTY SECONDS?

35:45.944 --> 35:47.549
NO.

35:47.549 --> 35:50.354
YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU SHOULD
TRY A LITTLE STASIS YOURSELF.

36:07.994 --> 36:09.999
WELL, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

36:10.400 --> 36:11.603
WHY DON'T YOU SEND
UP A FLARE OR SOMETHING?

36:12.005 --> 36:12.807
ADAM...

36:12.807 --> 36:14.009
NO, NO.

36:14.009 --> 36:14.810
WE HAVE NO TIME TO TALK.

36:15.211 --> 36:16.014
WAIT.

36:16.014 --> 36:17.215
ECKHART PUT A SUBDERMAL
GOVERNOR ON ME.

36:17.617 --> 36:18.418
I KNOW. THAT'S NOT FAIR, IS IT?

36:18.820 --> 36:20.825
HE LIED TO ME ABOUT EVERYTHING.

36:20.825 --> 36:22.427
WELL, SEE,
ALL THE MEN IN YOUR LIFE
HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT

36:22.427 --> 36:24.031
DISAPPOINTMENT,
HAVEN'T THEY?

36:24.031 --> 36:25.234
WELL,
SEE, I'M HERE TO
CHANGE ALL THAT.

36:25.234 --> 36:26.838
I'M GOING TO DEACTIVATE
YOUR SUBDERMAL GOVERNOR,

36:26.838 --> 36:28.441
AND MAKE IT ALL UP TO YOU.

36:28.441 --> 36:29.645
YOU'LL GET ME OUT OF HERE?

36:29.645 --> 36:31.249
WELL, THAT'S A
VERY GOOD PLACE TO START.

36:34.856 --> 36:36.460
NOW YOU AND I ARE
GOING TO MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.465
WE'RE GOING TO SELL
THIS LIST OF NEW MUTANTS

36:38.465 --> 36:39.669
TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.

36:39.669 --> 36:40.870
YOU'RE GOING
TO WORK YOUR MAGIC,

36:41.271 --> 36:42.472
AND WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE MILLIONS.

36:42.472 --> 36:44.076
YOU'RE GOING TO DESTROY
EVERYTHING YOU'VE CREATED?

36:44.478 --> 36:45.681
YEAH.

36:45.681 --> 36:47.284
DON'T DO THIS, ADAM.

36:47.284 --> 36:48.487
WHAT, YOU DON'T WANT
TO MAKE SOME CASH?

36:48.487 --> 36:50.491
NO. ADAM,
I DID THIS TO YOU.

36:50.491 --> 36:52.097
YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF.

36:52.097 --> 36:53.298
RIGHT. I'M BETTER.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.902
NOW GO INSIDE
AND GET WHAT YOU NEED.

36:54.902 --> 36:56.505
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU HERE.

36:56.908 --> 36:58.509
ADAM!

36:58.509 --> 37:00.514
HEY!

37:00.514 --> 37:04.524
I GUESS I
UNDERESTIMATED ALL OF YOU.

37:04.524 --> 37:07.331
YOU FORGOT TO TURN
YOUR COMLINK OFF, ADAM.

37:07.331 --> 37:10.136
YEAH. THANKS FOR MAKING
IT SO EASY FOR US.

37:10.136 --> 37:12.142
THE PLEASURE'S ALL MINE.

37:12.142 --> 37:14.147
HE'S GOING TO SELL THE DATABASE
TO AN INTERNATIONAL GENETICS...

37:14.147 --> 37:16.953
KEEP THAT TO YOURSELF.

37:24.569 --> 37:26.174
HEY.

37:54.638 --> 37:56.243
I CAN'T GO THROUGH THAT.

37:56.243 --> 37:57.846
YEAH,
THAT'S WHY HE DID IT.

38:09.473 --> 38:11.879
WHAT IS IT EXACTLY THAT
HAPPENS TO YOUR ELECTRICITY

38:11.879 --> 38:13.482
WHEN YOU GET WET?

38:13.482 --> 38:15.487
WHEN YOU GET SOAKED
WITH WATER, BRENNAN?

38:15.487 --> 38:17.092
HUH?

38:18.693 --> 38:21.100
I WAS TRYING
TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON
TO CHARLOTTE OVER HERE.

38:21.100 --> 38:23.907
NOW SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
WHY IT MAKES YOU SO WEAK.

39:08.808 --> 39:10.813
WHAT DO WE KNOW ABOUT YOU?

39:10.813 --> 39:12.416
WHAT'S YOUR WEAKEST MOMENT?

39:12.416 --> 39:14.020
WHEN YOU TAKE A BREATH.

39:29.656 --> 39:31.259
ADAM!

39:33.665 --> 39:35.269
LOOK INTO HER EYES.

39:35.269 --> 39:37.274
YOU ARE CHOKING THE
PERSON THAT WOULD DO ANYTHING

39:37.274 --> 39:39.278
IN THE WORLD TO PROTECT YOU.

39:39.278 --> 39:42.485
WHO LOVES YOU MORE
FIERCELY THAN ANYONE ELSE.

39:42.485 --> 39:46.094
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME, ADAM.

39:46.493 --> 39:50.502
SOMEWHERE INSIDE,
I KNOW THAT YOU HEAR ME.

39:54.513 --> 39:56.517
LET ME HELP YOU.

40:13.354 --> 40:15.360
OH GOD, I'M SORRY.

40:15.360 --> 40:17.365
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

40:17.365 --> 40:19.370
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

40:19.370 --> 40:21.774
YEAH.

40:35.806 --> 40:40.218
I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED TO
YOU, ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

40:40.218 --> 40:45.829
I'M SORRY I
HAD TO TURN HIM IN.

40:45.829 --> 40:49.037
BUT... HE IS THE ONE
YOU SHOULD BE ANGRY WITH.

40:49.037 --> 40:53.447
AND HE'S THE ONE
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE.

40:59.862 --> 41:02.668
THANKS FOR
NOT HATING ME.

41:02.668 --> 41:05.074
OF COURSE I
DON'T HATE YOU.

41:07.480 --> 41:10.286
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

41:10.286 --> 41:11.889
OKAY?

41:17.504 --> 41:18.704
IS SHE ALRIGHT?

41:18.704 --> 41:20.308
SHE WILL BE.

41:20.308 --> 41:21.912
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

41:21.912 --> 41:24.719
I'M TRYING NOT TO
THINK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH.

41:24.719 --> 41:25.921
COME ON, ADAM.

41:26.323 --> 41:28.327
THAT DOESN'T
SOUND LIKE YOU AT ALL.

41:28.327 --> 41:30.332
HM, WELL, MAYBE
NOT, BUT IT'S TRUE.

41:30.332 --> 41:33.940
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO ALL OF YOU FOR THE WAY

41:33.940 --> 41:35.945
I TREATED YOU ALL.

41:35.945 --> 41:37.146
NO, FORGET IT.

41:37.549 --> 41:39.554
YOU WEREN'T YOURSELF.

41:39.554 --> 41:40.755
NO, BUT I WAS.

41:40.755 --> 41:42.360
YOU KNOW, ASK SHALIMAR,
ASK JESSE, THEY...

41:42.360 --> 41:43.962
THEY EXPERIENCED IT.

41:44.365 --> 41:45.967
YEAH, WELL YOU COULDN'T
CONTROL YOURSELF, THAT'S ALL.

41:45.967 --> 41:47.169
WELL, MAYBE.

41:47.169 --> 41:48.773
BUT... IT WAS STILL ME.

41:48.773 --> 41:50.777
I KNEW YOUR WEAKNESSES,
AND I USED THEM AGAINST YOU.

41:51.179 --> 41:52.382
IT WAS VERY WEIRD.

41:52.382 --> 41:54.788
IT WAS VERY DARK.

41:54.788 --> 41:56.793
BUT YOU GUYS SAVED ME.

41:56.793 --> 42:00.401
AND...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

42:00.401 --> 42:03.205
THANK YOU.
