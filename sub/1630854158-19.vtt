00:06.398 --> 00:10.067
Hey, bettors, gambling's
now legal in every state,

00:10.069 --> 00:11.326
except the lame ones.

00:11.328 --> 00:13.178
But in the sport
of sports-betting,

00:13.180 --> 00:15.255
you got to sport-bet
responsibly.

00:15.257 --> 00:17.074
So, remember to follow
these three rules.

00:17.076 --> 00:19.092
Stick with the game plan,

00:19.094 --> 00:21.503
unless you're down a lot
at halftime.

00:21.505 --> 00:23.263
<i> ANNOUNCER: If you suffer</i>

00:32.516 --> 00:33.866
Thank you, football.

00:33.868 --> 00:35.609
I almost forgot
to bet on the game.

<i> TV SPORTSCASTER:</i>

00:38.113 --> 00:40.688
<i> we are officially</i>
<i> in garbage time, folks.</i>

00:40.690 --> 00:43.267
<i> Our only viewers left</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.047
HOMER: You got to lose money
to make money.

00:48.049 --> 00:50.532
If either team
scores any points,

00:50.534 --> 00:52.885
we'll be eating
name-brand ramen tonight.

00:52.887 --> 00:56.371
Let's go, either team!
Any points! Any points!

00:56.373 --> 00:57.723
<i>TV SPORTSCASTER: As the seconds</i>

<i> to humiliate the home team.</i>

01:02.897 --> 01:05.138
Yes, yes, humiliate us.

01:05.140 --> 01:06.807
Come on, lucky ring.

01:06.809 --> 01:09.142
You tricked Marge into staying
with me, you can do this.

01:09.144 --> 01:10.310
<i> TV SPORTSCASTER:</i>
<i> And the kick is good.</i>

01:10.312 --> 01:12.963

01:12.965 --> 01:15.491
Woo-hoo! You did it, points.

01:16.893 --> 01:18.494
D'oh!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.155
(grunting)

01:22.157 --> 01:25.709
Okay, my ring's got to be
down here somewhere.

01:28.480 --> 01:30.314
Man, I got to get a handyman.

01:30.316 --> 01:32.574
We used to have the greatest
guy, what was his name?

01:32.576 --> 01:34.301
Dave? Darryl?

01:37.990 --> 01:40.099
(ghostly cackling)

01:40.101 --> 01:42.101
(gasps) Is that a ghost?

01:42.103 --> 01:45.178
If so, that means
the afterlife is real,

01:45.180 --> 01:47.439
which would free me
from my fear of death.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.516
(gasps) Please be a ghost.
(gasps)

01:49.518 --> 01:51.759
The ring.

01:51.761 --> 01:53.094
Huh? Another the ring?

01:53.096 --> 01:54.262
(hisses)

01:54.264 --> 01:55.522
(screams) Polecat!

01:55.524 --> 01:58.558
Okay, little skunk,
everything's cool.

01:58.560 --> 02:02.195
I'll just back away calmly,
leave you alone,

02:02.197 --> 02:04.698
and hire someone to kill you.

02:04.700 --> 02:06.183
(soft footsteps)

02:06.185 --> 02:07.942
-(both hiss)
-(gasps) More.

02:07.944 --> 02:11.688
-(hissing)
-It's a stink of skunks.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.966
(whimpering)

02:13.968 --> 02:16.526
Marge, kids, remember me
how I used to smell,

02:16.528 --> 02:19.045
not as the horrible stench
I'm about to become.

02:19.047 --> 02:22.366
I love you all,
to varying degrees.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.201
(screams)

02:24.203 --> 02:26.794
Ooh, my ring. (screams)

02:26.796 --> 02:29.297
(both laugh)

02:29.299 --> 02:32.542
This is my new
desert island show.

02:32.544 --> 02:35.487
All right, turn around
and spread 'em.

02:37.566 --> 02:40.826
Ow! Oh. (laughs)

02:40.828 --> 02:42.661
Ooh. Ow!

02:42.663 --> 02:43.996
More, please.

02:45.908 --> 02:47.224
Ew,<i> caramba!</i>

02:47.226 --> 02:49.984
Shouldn't you throw
those clothes out?

02:49.986 --> 02:51.395
Rather than clean them?

02:51.397 --> 02:53.230
Don't rob me of the one part

02:53.232 --> 02:55.732
of your dad getting
skunk-sprayed I enjoy.

02:55.734 --> 02:58.760
All I need is this pillowcase
and my secret ingredients.

03:06.261 --> 03:08.912
Wow, that took care
of the skunk smell

03:08.914 --> 03:10.171
and the Homer smell.

03:10.173 --> 03:12.082
That's amazing, Mom.

03:12.084 --> 03:14.084
How did you learn to do that?

03:14.086 --> 03:15.527
Years of practice.

03:15.529 --> 03:19.489
Your father has brought home
so many different smells.

03:26.356 --> 03:29.041
This bag cleans them all.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.210
Wow, an innovation like this

03:31.212 --> 03:33.453
could really better
the lives of people

03:33.455 --> 03:36.197
who don't have access
to washing machines.

03:36.199 --> 03:37.958
Ooh, like the homeless?

03:37.960 --> 03:39.459
You mean unhoused.

03:39.461 --> 03:40.552
I do?

03:44.116 --> 03:46.708
How come all of these
pillowcases are blue?

03:46.710 --> 03:50.454
I think it's from my hair.
Not that I dye my hair.

03:50.456 --> 03:53.565
It's natural. It's just such
a vibrant natural blue that...

03:53.567 --> 03:56.735
It's okay, Mom.
The blue's a nice touch.

03:58.964 --> 04:00.464
It's a cleaning bag.

04:00.466 --> 04:03.224
You shake your dirty clothes
in it, and they come out fresh.

04:03.226 --> 04:05.494
Oh. Oh, you're already doing it.

04:07.397 --> 04:09.139
Ah, hot diggity.

04:09.141 --> 04:11.065
I can finally get
my old job back

04:11.067 --> 04:14.461
as a stock image model
for "man in suit."

04:18.241 --> 04:21.167
Wow, them-there blue bags
are impressive.

04:21.169 --> 04:22.970
Can I give it a try?

04:26.600 --> 04:29.993
That bag of yours finally
cleaned my black hat.

04:29.995 --> 04:31.270
Yee-haw!

04:31.272 --> 04:34.164
Let me contribute $100
to your cause,

04:34.166 --> 04:35.923
a Texas penny.

04:35.925 --> 04:37.834
So, what's the name
of your charity?

04:37.836 --> 04:39.444
Oh, we don't have a charity.

04:39.446 --> 04:42.096
I guess you can
make it out to me.

04:42.098 --> 04:45.358
Uh, you see, this is money
I want to deduct

04:45.360 --> 04:47.677
while avoiding capital gains.

04:47.679 --> 04:51.606
So, I can only contribute
to a charitable foundation.

04:51.608 --> 04:54.034
A 501-C-HAW.

04:54.036 --> 04:56.369
(gasps) We should become
an actual charity.

04:56.371 --> 04:58.538
Think of how many
more people we would help.

04:58.540 --> 05:01.024
Doesn't that involve
a lot of paperwork?

05:01.026 --> 05:02.526
You're in luck, little lady.

05:02.528 --> 05:06.087
I got me my accountant
right here.

05:07.457 --> 05:11.051
Golly. Here's your articles
of incorporation, ma'am.

05:11.053 --> 05:13.294
What do you want to call
that-there charity?

05:13.296 --> 05:16.148
Hmm... Why not call it...

05:16.150 --> 05:18.984
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.652
Really?

05:20.654 --> 05:23.380
It was your passion for change
that got us here.

05:23.382 --> 05:25.398
I just threw some powder
in a bag.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.901
Here's my charitable deduction.

05:27.903 --> 05:30.387
I mean donation. I mean both.

05:30.389 --> 05:32.831
I love anything
that gets me out of taxes.

05:32.833 --> 05:33.999
Texas?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.651
No, taxes. I hate taxes,

05:36.653 --> 05:38.411
but I love Texas

05:38.413 --> 05:42.232
'cause folks in Texas
love Texas and hates taxes.

05:42.234 --> 05:45.344
No taxing's what Texans
stand for.

05:49.016 --> 05:51.074
We're a charity!

05:51.076 --> 05:52.851
BOTH:
Yee-haw!

05:52.853 --> 05:55.604
-Yee-haw.
-Yee-haw, indeed.

06:00.194 --> 06:03.010
I used to ride the rails,
but 'cause of you,

06:03.012 --> 06:06.365
I traded in my bindle
for a briefcase.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.093
We're really making a difference
in people's lives.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.352
Even Crazy Cat Lady.

06:11.354 --> 06:14.689
She's giving walking tours
of Springfield now.

06:14.691 --> 06:17.601
(mumbling)

06:17.603 --> 06:20.194
(cats yowling)

06:20.196 --> 06:22.288
-(cameras clicking)
-(group aahing)

06:23.291 --> 06:25.032
Lisa, can you run over
to the market

06:25.034 --> 06:27.277
and get some more baking soda?

06:27.279 --> 06:30.447
Wait, we're using
Hand & Armor Baking Soda?

06:30.449 --> 06:34.208
That company is the worst.
They support child labor.

06:34.210 --> 06:37.562
Even some of their
top executives are children.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.732
MARGE: But the smiley hand
on the box is so cute.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.235
Our foundation only succeeds
if we're doing good

06:43.237 --> 06:44.477
every step of the way.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.480
We have to make sure that
every ingredient we use

06:47.482 --> 06:50.742
is ethically sourced,
even if it costs a little more.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.302
Well, I can help with that.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.246
I put the "fun mom"

06:54.248 --> 06:57.749
in the
"fundraising thermometer."

06:57.751 --> 06:59.567
(groans) Mom puns?

06:59.569 --> 07:01.995
I got to wash that
out of my ears.

07:01.997 --> 07:04.923
(grunting)

07:04.925 --> 07:06.650
Okay, while you're
raising money,

07:06.652 --> 07:09.928
I'll scour the world
for fair-trade, carbon-negative,

07:09.930 --> 07:12.246
conflict-free ingredients.
Dad can take me.

07:12.248 --> 07:15.992
Oh, that sounds terrible.

07:15.994 --> 07:17.677
Oh, it's even worse.

07:17.679 --> 07:20.272
I've got a good feeling about
the baking soda manufacturer

07:20.274 --> 07:22.666
at the top of this mountain.

07:22.668 --> 07:26.503
Oh, why can't anything good ever
be at the bottom of a mountain?

07:26.505 --> 07:30.190
Our baking soda is actually
generated through meditation.

07:30.192 --> 07:32.342
Every ten boxes we make,

07:32.344 --> 07:34.494
a new monk
reaches enlightenment.

07:38.517 --> 07:42.018
Oh, my God, I finally understand
the plot of<i> Inception.</i>

07:42.020 --> 07:44.463
Now to ponder<i> Tenet.</i>

07:46.191 --> 07:47.966
LISA:
Oh...

07:47.968 --> 07:50.860
(sniffs) This is
the first empty fridge

07:50.862 --> 07:51.953
I've ever liked.

07:51.955 --> 07:53.454
(sniffs)

07:53.456 --> 07:56.716
Oh, I'll take it.
How much is it?

07:56.718 --> 07:58.977
We don't believe
in worldly possessions,

07:58.979 --> 08:02.055
so you won't have any
after you buy it.

08:02.057 --> 08:04.483
(whistles)

08:05.560 --> 08:06.693
(phone whooshes)

08:08.880 --> 08:09.896
(phone whooshes)

08:09.898 --> 08:11.064
Show your support

08:11.066 --> 08:13.975
for the Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation.

08:13.977 --> 08:15.327
Hey, this corner belongs
to the Salvation Army.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.996
Give me that tin
and get out of here.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.831
Unless you'd like
to donate blood.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.375
(bell rings)

08:23.395 --> 08:25.670
Oh, Marge, that was terrible.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.081
Who knew a religious nonprofit

08:28.083 --> 08:30.157
could be so "holier than thou"?

08:30.159 --> 08:33.995
As a pillar of the community,
a doctor's wife,

08:33.997 --> 08:35.830
I know the secret

08:35.832 --> 08:37.957
to running a successful charity.

08:37.959 --> 08:40.334
Ooh, can you tell it to me?

08:40.336 --> 08:43.170
Even better,
I can sing it to you.

Well, it used to be
a WeWork space,

09:44.084 --> 09:47.310
then a Theranos lab,
then production offices

09:47.312 --> 09:49.421
for the WeWork
and Theranos TV shows.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.165
Those businesses must have been
such successes

09:52.167 --> 09:54.984
to have TV shows
made about them.

09:54.986 --> 09:56.344
Mm.

09:58.824 --> 10:00.340
Is it a little strange that

10:00.342 --> 10:03.417
everyone has to walk through my
office to get to the bathroom?

10:03.419 --> 10:05.829
That's your private bathroom.

10:05.831 --> 10:08.255
(gasps) A husbandless bathroom?

10:08.257 --> 10:10.350
I won't need a candle.

10:10.352 --> 10:12.277
Our "Feeling Blue"
awareness campaign

10:12.279 --> 10:14.428
is really hitting its stride.

10:14.430 --> 10:17.098
Look at all these products
supporting our cause

10:17.100 --> 10:19.100
with our copyrighted
shade of blue:

10:19.102 --> 10:21.119
blue shampoo, blue conditioner,

10:21.121 --> 10:23.437
blue shampoo plus conditioner,

10:23.439 --> 10:26.774
and Boo Berry cereal will be
called Blueberry cereal.

10:26.776 --> 10:28.126
LISA:
Mom.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.519
Look at all these people.

10:29.521 --> 10:32.797
Our little charity
has become big.

10:32.799 --> 10:34.357
Check out our official symbol.

10:34.359 --> 10:37.210
It's the same ribbon we use
to tie the blue bags.

10:37.212 --> 10:38.361
They've become so popular

10:38.363 --> 10:41.806
we've completely
run out of ribbons.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.201
So what do you tie
the bags with?

10:45.203 --> 10:47.479
Well, we're a little behind
in our bag making,

10:47.481 --> 10:49.372
but we've been doing something
even more important:

10:49.374 --> 10:52.800
raising awareness
about our bag making.

10:52.802 --> 10:56.412
This is all very impressive,
but do we really need

10:56.414 --> 10:57.471
a headquarters this big?

10:57.473 --> 11:00.884
Oh, this isn't gonna be
our headquarters.

11:00.886 --> 11:02.160
This is.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.979
How on earth are we
paying for that?

11:04.981 --> 11:09.058
With a generous deduction--
I mean, I mean, donation--

11:09.060 --> 11:12.578
from our Royal Blue level donor:
Mr. Burns.

11:12.580 --> 11:16.299
What? He is the biggest
polluter in town.

11:22.757 --> 11:23.923
Excellent.

11:23.925 --> 11:26.500
Honey, if we don't accept
the money,

11:26.502 --> 11:28.094
he'll just give it
to someone else,

11:28.096 --> 11:31.940
like the Salvation Army.
(groans)

11:32.842 --> 11:35.251
We have to return Burns's money.

11:35.253 --> 11:37.253
Return the money?

11:37.255 --> 11:39.847
While you and Dad were tromping
around in the mountains,

11:39.849 --> 11:41.441
I was building an organization

11:41.443 --> 11:43.868
that can make
real change happen.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.445
With what? This?

11:45.447 --> 11:49.449
Mom, you're just allowing
evil companies to appear ethical

11:49.451 --> 11:52.285
by slapping our color
on their product.

11:52.287 --> 11:55.788
It's bluewashing.
That doesn't help the homeless.

11:55.790 --> 11:58.049
We call them the unhoused.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.276
I call them the unhoused!

12:00.278 --> 12:02.445
Ugh! You've lost sight

12:02.447 --> 12:04.948
of my vision for this charity.

12:04.950 --> 12:07.133
I thought it was our charity.

12:07.135 --> 12:09.786
Well, it's my name on the wall.

12:09.788 --> 12:11.304
Well, it's my hair color.

12:11.306 --> 12:14.457
-It's Clairol's color!
-(gasps)

12:14.459 --> 12:17.627
Okay, this clearly
got out of hand.

12:17.629 --> 12:20.363
Why don't we take
a little breather.

12:21.816 --> 12:24.058
Okay, have we both calmed down?

12:24.060 --> 12:25.635
I don't need to calm down.

12:25.637 --> 12:26.578
I'm your mother.

12:26.972 --> 12:29.230
I think I know you better
than you know yourself.

12:29.232 --> 12:30.974
Oh, you're making
my future therapist

12:30.976 --> 12:34.644
so rich right now.

12:34.646 --> 12:35.828
Maybe we should take

12:35.830 --> 12:37.922
a little bit longer of a break.

12:37.924 --> 12:40.008
Same time tomorrow.

12:41.669 --> 12:43.002
Okay, are you better?

12:43.004 --> 12:45.013
(groaning)

12:48.918 --> 12:50.268
Okay, this feels good.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.162
I think that last break
was the clincher.

12:53.164 --> 12:55.774
One more and we get
a free sundae. (chuckles)

12:55.776 --> 12:57.333
I have some good news.

12:57.335 --> 12:59.335
The board has decided
to promote you

12:59.337 --> 13:01.929
to "The Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation

13:01.931 --> 13:04.932
Founder Emeritus."

13:04.934 --> 13:07.677
Wait... emeritus?

13:07.679 --> 13:09.178
I know what that means.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.105
You're firing me?

13:11.107 --> 13:13.792
No, we're just
de-responsibilitizing you.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.960
Congratulations.

13:15.962 --> 13:17.611
Here's your check.

13:17.613 --> 13:20.039
Would you like to round up
with a donation

13:20.041 --> 13:22.041
to the Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation?

13:22.043 --> 13:25.220
No! I never want to hear
that name again.

13:26.455 --> 13:29.957
It's my favorite student,
Lisa M. Simpson.

13:29.959 --> 13:32.126
-(grunts)
-(muffled groan)

13:32.128 --> 13:35.480
There, now you got ice cream.
Let's go.

13:38.560 --> 13:41.319
Yeah, I heard about
what happened.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.546
That I was forced out
by my own mother

13:43.548 --> 13:46.232
from the charity
we created together?

13:46.234 --> 13:48.159
I've never been fired before.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.078
What am I supposed to do?

13:51.480 --> 13:54.073
You don't know how long
I've been waiting for this.

13:54.075 --> 13:55.408
Finally,
I can pass down to my kids

13:55.410 --> 13:59.395
my vast knowledge about
what I'm truly amazing at:

13:59.397 --> 14:02.156
-being canned.
-Really?

14:02.158 --> 14:05.326
Oh, being fired is basically
my job these days.

14:05.328 --> 14:08.012
In fact, I was fired yesterday
because of all the time I took

14:08.014 --> 14:09.514
looking for ingredients
with you.

14:09.516 --> 14:12.016
(scoffs) At least you don't
have to live in the same house

14:12.018 --> 14:14.260
as the jerk who fired you.

14:14.262 --> 14:15.595
Ah, anger.

14:15.597 --> 14:18.931
The first stage in the
five stages of getting fired.

14:18.933 --> 14:21.175
Oh, so there's
a process to this?

14:21.177 --> 14:22.509
What's stage two?

14:22.511 --> 14:24.863
Pretending you still have a job.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.365
MARGE:
Homer, can you
take out the garbage?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.410
Oh, sorry, honey.
I'm late for work. Let's go.

14:32.355 --> 14:35.206
So, how long do we have to sit
in this coffee shop?

14:35.208 --> 14:37.858
Until my boss realizes
he made a huge mistake firing me

14:37.860 --> 14:39.435
and begs me to come back,

14:39.437 --> 14:42.029
but instead
I pour macaroni salad

14:42.031 --> 14:43.773
into his sunroof.

14:43.775 --> 14:45.625
Wasn't anger stage one?

14:45.627 --> 14:47.460
That was righteous anger.

14:47.462 --> 14:49.795
This is misdirected anger!
(grunts)

14:49.797 --> 14:53.349
Ah, stage three.

14:55.228 --> 14:59.397
Hi, Lisa. I see you're
still on the couch.

14:59.399 --> 15:00.714
How you doing?

15:00.716 --> 15:03.717
I'd be doing a lot better
if you moved that body

15:03.719 --> 15:05.461
I "ruined in childbirth."

15:05.463 --> 15:07.647
-I ruined it first. (slurps)
-(sighs)

15:07.649 --> 15:11.984
Lisa and I aren't supposed to
have doomsday fights like this

15:11.986 --> 15:13.560
until she's 14.

15:13.562 --> 15:16.563
She always was precocious.
(sighs) Oh...

15:16.565 --> 15:19.325
Now all she does
is lie around watching TV.

15:19.327 --> 15:22.645
That's stage four:
"glowering without showering."

15:22.647 --> 15:25.815
But don't worry,
we're almost at stage five:

15:25.817 --> 15:27.333
"reluctant acceptance."

15:27.335 --> 15:28.501
You'll have your daughter back,

15:28.503 --> 15:32.004
and I won't have to
keep making up stages.

15:32.006 --> 15:34.265
Hey, Mom, I wanted to say...

15:34.267 --> 15:36.768
you worked so hard
to make our charity

15:36.770 --> 15:38.494
a successful organization.

15:38.496 --> 15:40.513
And then I came in
criticizing it

15:40.515 --> 15:43.590
and making you feel bad.
I'm sorry.

15:43.592 --> 15:45.668
Oh, sweetie.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.094
Mm, mm.

15:47.096 --> 15:48.780
So, I'll see you
at the grand opening

15:48.782 --> 15:53.009
of the Lisa M. Simpson
Foundation Headquarters tonight?

15:53.011 --> 15:55.011
Of course.

15:55.013 --> 15:57.013
I'm proud of you, honey.

15:57.015 --> 15:58.864
You're now ready for stage six:

15:58.866 --> 16:01.200
buy podcasting equipment

16:01.202 --> 16:03.962
but never unbox it.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.965
And we successfully sued
Pabst Blue Ribbon

16:06.967 --> 16:08.633
for using our trademark symbol.

16:08.635 --> 16:12.453
From now on, they'll be known
as Pabst Teal Fabric Bow.

16:12.455 --> 16:15.306
Our awareness is at
an all-time high.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.459
That's great. I guess now
we can put our efforts

16:18.461 --> 16:20.728
into helping people
on the streets.

16:22.798 --> 16:26.225
As the wife of a surgeon,
I'm all about helping people,

16:26.227 --> 16:28.987
but we're a mega-successful
nonprofit,

16:28.989 --> 16:30.563
not some charity.

16:30.565 --> 16:33.232
As the wife of a radiologist,
I agree.

16:33.234 --> 16:35.493
But what about
all the big donations...

16:35.495 --> 16:38.496
I mean deductions
we got from companies

16:38.498 --> 16:41.165
for letting them put our logo
on their products?

16:41.167 --> 16:43.909
Marge, we didn't get money
for that.

16:43.911 --> 16:46.487
The companies paid us
in awareness.

16:46.489 --> 16:49.340
But when do we start
helping people?

16:50.251 --> 16:52.593
My wife's a dermatologist.

17:03.248 --> 17:05.973
Oh, God, Lisa was right.

17:05.975 --> 17:08.359
We have been bluewashing.

17:10.346 --> 17:13.531
I don't deserve to walk
on the blue carpet.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.366
Take me around back.

17:17.019 --> 17:20.279
Mm, all this opulence
is making me queasy.

17:20.281 --> 17:23.374
Oh, Lisa, queasiness
is just hunger in disguise,

17:23.376 --> 17:25.451
like how a hangover
means you should drink more.

17:25.453 --> 17:28.862
Okay, boy, what's your intel
on the passed app situation?

17:28.864 --> 17:30.439
We got mini quiches on our six

17:30.441 --> 17:32.216
and ahi tuna cones
at ten and two.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.369
Fan out, and don't fall
for the bruschetta.

17:35.371 --> 17:37.296
It's a trap to fill you up.

17:37.298 --> 17:40.224
It's an honor to be
your chicken wing man.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.268
♪

17:49.627 --> 17:50.459
(groans softly)

17:50.461 --> 17:53.462
Gil? What are you doing here?

17:53.464 --> 17:56.299
I thought our blue bag
turned your life around.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.651
Ah, well, it did, for a bit,
but then they demolished

17:58.653 --> 18:01.895
the low-income housing
I was living in to build that.

18:01.897 --> 18:04.156
Now ol' Gil is homeless.

18:04.158 --> 18:05.825
You mean unhoused?

18:05.827 --> 18:07.993
I'm living in a tent
on a sidewalk

18:07.995 --> 18:09.921
and people yell at me
for it every day.

18:09.923 --> 18:11.647
I can call it whatever I want.

18:11.649 --> 18:14.467
(grunts)

18:16.337 --> 18:18.245
(orchestra playing
classical music)

18:18.247 --> 18:19.822
-(strings scratch)
-(music stops)

18:19.824 --> 18:24.602
And here's the CEO of
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation,

18:24.604 --> 18:26.162
Marge Simpson.

18:26.164 --> 18:28.013
(cheering)

18:28.015 --> 18:30.666
I would like to thank
all of you for coming.

18:30.668 --> 18:34.112
Actually, I would like to judge
all of you for coming.

18:34.114 --> 18:35.596
-Huh?
-(overlapping chatter)

18:35.598 --> 18:39.175
This charity was supposed
to help the homeless.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.010
Instead,
we evicted people to build

18:41.012 --> 18:42.769
this extravagant headquarters,

18:42.771 --> 18:45.681
creating more homelessness.

18:45.683 --> 18:46.824
More homeless on the street

18:46.826 --> 18:49.109
will help raise awareness.

18:49.111 --> 18:51.187
I'm done with raising awareness

18:51.189 --> 18:52.463
and with raising money

18:52.465 --> 18:55.358
and with razing
low-income housing.

18:55.360 --> 18:58.136
It's time to turn
the Lisa M. Simpson Foundation

18:58.138 --> 18:59.362
over to the one person

18:59.364 --> 19:02.198
who knew how to run it right
all along,

19:02.200 --> 19:04.124
Lisa Simpson.

19:04.126 --> 19:06.126
(overlapping chatter)

19:06.128 --> 19:08.387
Lisa Simpson's a real person?

19:08.389 --> 19:12.057
Thanks, Mom.
As co-head of this organization,

19:12.059 --> 19:15.211
I'm turning this building
into a shelter

19:15.213 --> 19:17.229
-for the unhoused.
-(crowd gasping)

19:17.231 --> 19:18.990
Marge, you have to
shut this down.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.901
No, I have to open this up.

19:21.903 --> 19:24.053
(overlapping chatter)

19:24.055 --> 19:26.222
(gasps) They don't know
which fork to use.

19:26.224 --> 19:28.666
She's wearing a dress
I gave away.

19:28.668 --> 19:33.229
(blubbers) That's the man I had
in my windshield for a night.

19:33.231 --> 19:34.988
Enough of this do-goodery.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.490
Open your eyes, rich people.

19:36.492 --> 19:38.584
We're not here to help
the less fortunate,

19:38.586 --> 19:41.328
we're here to bask
in our fortunateness.

19:41.330 --> 19:43.163
If we really wanted
to make a difference,

19:43.165 --> 19:45.925
we'd do the one thing
we've spent our lives avoiding,

19:45.927 --> 19:47.760
paying our taxes.

19:47.762 --> 19:50.079
(laughter)

19:50.081 --> 19:52.765
Then one organization,
"the government,"

19:52.767 --> 19:54.917
could tackle all
of society's ills,

19:54.919 --> 19:57.436
instead of leaving it
to 1.5 million separate

19:57.438 --> 20:01.532
ego-driven micro-bureaucracies
called "charities,"

20:01.534 --> 20:04.944
including-- get a load
of this scam-- religions.

20:04.946 --> 20:07.279
But no one here wants
the rational way.

20:07.281 --> 20:10.115
We all want the United Way

20:10.117 --> 20:12.435
because that's the American way.

20:12.437 --> 20:15.287
Now, I paid $10,000
for this table.

20:15.289 --> 20:17.465
I'm taking it with me.

20:20.869 --> 20:24.447
Thank you, Mom. You did
something really great tonight.

20:24.449 --> 20:27.391
Now, let's turn this building
over to the homeless.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.436
Yes. We just need
to get this notarized.

20:32.957 --> 20:34.790
