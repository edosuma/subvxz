00:32.080 --> 00:33.400
&lrm;Wow, roar.

00:37.840 --> 00:41.480
&lrm;FYI, Marinette's never gonna
&lrm;fall in love with a statue.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.080
&lrm;You know I'm no good with the ladies,

00:44.200 --> 00:46.320
&lrm;especially this one all of a sudden.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.080
&lrm;Do I go up to her and crack a joke?
&lrm;Shoot her a compliment?

00:50.240 --> 00:52.120
&lrm;Invite her to the zoo? Play it serious?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.560
&lrm;Nino, you're over-thinking this.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.760
&lrm;Invite her to the zoo? Seriously?

00:58.040 --> 01:00.280
&lrm;Well, they have a cool new exhibit.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.680
&lrm;Listen, just be yourself, man.

01:02.840 --> 01:06.200
&lrm;Easy for you to say,
&lrm;Mr. Front-Cover-Teen-Model.

01:06.360 --> 01:07.560
&lrm;I'm not that cool.

01:07.760 --> 01:11.040
&lrm;You're cool too, dude,
&lrm;or you wouldn't be my best bud.

01:11.160 --> 01:14.400
&lrm;Invite her to the zoo.
&lrm;She'll say yes, I promise.

01:21.920 --> 01:23.680
&lrm;What if I act like a moron

01:23.840 --> 01:25.960
&lrm;or she kisses me or thinks I'm lame?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.360
&lrm;OK, I got your back.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.600

&lrm;All the above.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.160
&lrm;-So sorry... right, Nino?
&lrm;-S-Sorry.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.600
&lrm;[together] -Sorry.

01:56.520 --> 01:57.800
&lrm;Sorry about that.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.120
&lrm;How could we make it up to you?

02:00.360 --> 02:02.280
&lrm;Any ideas, Nino?

02:02.400 --> 02:03.760
&lrm;[Nino murmurs]

02:03.880 --> 02:06.880
&lrm;How about we all check out the zoo?

02:07.160 --> 02:08.720
&lrm;They have a new...

02:09.479 --> 02:12.040
&lrm;T-T-They've got a new panther.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.560
&lrm;Awesome idea, right, Marinette?
&lrm;You love animals.

02:15.680 --> 02:19.200
&lrm;Yeah, I'm really into zoonimals.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.960
&lrm;I mean... anizools, I mean zoonimals.

02:23.600 --> 02:26.120
&lrm;Cool, say after school, four o'clock?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.280
&lrm;Nino, sound good?

02:27.600 --> 02:29.160
&lrm;Cool, four o'clock.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.120
&lrm;Four! Four o'clock.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.960
&lrm;[dazed] Yeah.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.720
&lrm;Earth to Marinette.

02:35.840 --> 02:40.040
&lrm;Do you realise the guy
&lrm;you're crazy about asked you out?

02:40.320 --> 02:41.240
&lrm;[dazed] Yeah.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.160
&lrm;Wait... What? No!

02:43.320 --> 02:46.240
&lrm;Not like this. Not today.
&lrm;I haven't washed my hair.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.080
&lrm;I'm not wearing my lucky socks.
&lrm;Help me Alya.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.960
&lrm;I can't do this alone.

02:52.680 --> 02:54.120
&lrm;How did you do that?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.680
&lrm;-Like I said, just be yourself.
&lrm;-Right.

02:56.880 --> 02:59.280
&lrm;Sure... If I could be yourself.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.160
&lrm;Myself don't work that way.

03:01.280 --> 03:03.280
&lrm;Don't be ridiculous, of course you can.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.720
&lrm;When you're alone with Marinette...

03:06.040 --> 03:07.640
&lrm;What? Alone?

03:07.760 --> 03:09.800
&lrm;No, dude, you're coming too.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.520
&lrm;You can't leave me alone, no way.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.480
&lrm;OK, Nino. What are friends for?

03:17.320 --> 03:20.200
&lrm;[crackling] <i>&lrm;One, two, one, two, testing.</i>

03:20.400 --> 03:21.320
<i>&lrm;Do you read me?</i>

03:21.440 --> 03:24.240
&lrm;I can hear you.
&lrm;but I don't think I can do it.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.160
&lrm;Of course you can. Just be yourself.

03:27.280 --> 03:29.360
&lrm;Remember the last time I did that?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.720
&lrm;Just be yourself, Marinette.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.360
&lrm;[nervous giggle]

03:35.840 --> 03:37.800
&lrm;Hey! What are you doing in here?

03:38.040 --> 03:39.360
&lrm;Get out!

03:39.920 --> 03:43.080
&lrm;Fine, just be yourself
&lrm;but look where you're going.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.320
&lrm;Where are you, love of my life?

03:47.880 --> 03:49.680
&lrm;How can he be the love of your life

03:49.800 --> 03:51.320
&lrm;if you can't even talk to him?

03:51.640 --> 03:53.080
&lrm;Tikki, stay hidden.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.560
&lrm;I'm gonna talk to him.
&lrm;You'll see. I will talk to him.

03:56.720 --> 03:58.600
<i>&lrm;That's right, girl, way to be motivated.</i>

03:58.720 --> 03:59.640
&lrm;Yeah.

03:59.760 --> 04:01.120
&lrm;There they are.

04:02.840 --> 04:03.680
&lrm;Hi, Marinette.

04:04.600 --> 04:05.840
&lrm;False alarm.

04:06.760 --> 04:08.600
&lrm;Hi, Kim, Max, what are you doing?

04:08.720 --> 04:12.040
&lrm;We heard the new panther's here.
&lrm;I wanna see who's strongest.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.240
&lrm;Wanna come?

04:13.520 --> 04:15.200
<i>&lrm;-Target at ten o'clock.</i>
&lrm;-No!

04:16.880 --> 04:17.800
&lrm;I mean,

04:18.120 --> 04:19.519
&lrm;thanks but no thanks.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.880
&lrm;I'm waiting for someone. Go ahead.

04:22.160 --> 04:23.800
&lrm;OK. Maybe see you later.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.760
&lrm;Yeah, later.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.080
&lrm;Where's Adrien?

04:31.200 --> 04:32.120
<i>&lrm;I don't know.</i>

04:32.240 --> 04:35.640
&lrm;Hey, Nino. Isn't Adrien with you?

04:37.800 --> 04:38.880
&lrm;Say you'll be better off

04:39.000 --> 04:39.840
<i>&lrm;without me.</i>

04:39.960 --> 04:41.360
&lrm;We'll be better off without me.

04:42.440 --> 04:45.720
&lrm;This is turning out to be
&lrm;more interesting than I thought.

04:45.840 --> 04:47.040
&lrm;Turn up the volume.

04:47.280 --> 04:48.840
&lrm;Without him, I mean.

04:48.960 --> 04:51.800
&lrm;We don't need him to hang out at the zoo.

04:51.920 --> 04:53.520
<i>&lrm;Of course we do, dumbo.</i>

04:53.640 --> 04:55.040
&lrm;Of course we do, dum...

04:55.160 --> 04:58.520
&lrm;I mean, wasn't he meant to come?
&lrm;Do you wanna wait?

04:58.640 --> 05:00.600
<i>&lrm;Tell her you want to be alone with her.</i>

05:00.720 --> 05:02.280
&lrm;-Not yet.
&lrm;-What?

05:02.400 --> 05:03.800
&lrm;You're right. We'll wait.

05:04.080 --> 05:07.560
<i>&lrm;No. What are you talking about?</i>
<i>&lrm;Don't wait, I'm not coming.</i>

05:07.920 --> 05:09.880
&lrm;Look what Daddy's brought you.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.280
&lrm;Only the finest for my baby.

05:14.120 --> 05:17.280
&lrm;Wow! Look at the size
&lrm;of that piece of meat.

05:17.520 --> 05:22.240
&lrm;Typical diet for a feline
&lrm;requiring the strength to run at 60mph.

05:22.560 --> 05:24.680
&lrm;60mph? Is that all?

05:24.840 --> 05:27.000
&lrm;I thought they ran faster than that.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.000
&lrm;I bet I could beat it.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.800
&lrm;Impossible.
&lrm;No human could compete with my panther.

05:33.080 --> 05:37.120
&lrm;Yeah? Where did your cat come
&lrm;at the county athletics?

05:37.400 --> 05:38.680
&lrm;I came first.

05:39.200 --> 05:42.280
&lrm;You can't compare yourself
&lrm;to my panther, kiddo.

05:42.440 --> 05:45.200
&lrm;No need.
&lrm;I'm obviously the better looking one.

05:45.520 --> 05:46.720
&lrm;[growling]

05:47.040 --> 05:50.960
&lrm;Hey, kitty. How about a little race?
&lrm;Last one's a rotten egg.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.480
&lrm;Let's see. With a 6ft per second wind

05:53.640 --> 05:55.840
&lrm;and the sun at 45 degrees...

05:55.960 --> 05:58.840
&lrm;You wouldn't be a rotten egg,
&lrm;you'd be lunch.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.000
&lrm;Your friend's right. Now leave.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.640
&lrm;She needs to eat in peace.
&lrm;You're stressing her out.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.600
&lrm;[growling]

06:04.720 --> 06:06.920
&lrm;Stressed out are we, Miss Panthy?

06:07.040 --> 06:09.240
&lrm;It's a wild animal, dude.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.440
&lrm;[roar]

06:10.560 --> 06:13.560
&lrm;Leave now
&lrm;or I'll have you kicked out of the zoo.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.880
&lrm;[mockingly] Come on, Max.

06:15.000 --> 06:20.160
&lrm;Let's leave that poor kitty alone
&lrm;with its angry babysitter.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.720
&lrm;[chuckling]

06:22.640 --> 06:23.720
&lrm;[growling]

06:23.840 --> 06:25.200
&lrm;[growling]

06:27.160 --> 06:30.000
&lrm;[evil voice]
&lrm;Unleashing the animal in each of us.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.040
&lrm;I like that idea.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.800
&lrm;Go ahead, my little evil Akuma,

06:41.920 --> 06:45.160
&lrm;fly off and take control
&lrm;of that zoo keeper.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.280
&lrm;He's sure taking his time, isn't he?

06:52.760 --> 06:54.520
&lrm;He's not coming, is he?

06:54.640 --> 06:58.720
<i>&lrm;Repeat after me.</i>
<i>&lrm;Yes, he is but first I wanted to...</i>

06:58.840 --> 06:59.760
&lrm;Yes, he is

07:00.040 --> 07:02.160
&lrm;but first I wanted to...

07:02.320 --> 07:04.120
<i>&lrm;tell you that I love you.</i>

07:04.400 --> 07:06.360
&lrm;tell you that I...

07:06.480 --> 07:09.560
&lrm;I... love a girl
&lrm;but don't know how to tell her.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.040
&lrm;What are you doing?

07:11.160 --> 07:14.080
&lrm;You do? Well, I can help you with that.

07:14.280 --> 07:15.200
&lrm;You could?

07:15.320 --> 07:18.240
<i>&lrm;You? Give expert advice on love?</i>

07:18.680 --> 07:20.560
<i>&lrm;Can't wait to hear it.</i>

07:20.680 --> 07:22.240
&lrm;[mockingly] Can't wait to hear it.

07:22.360 --> 07:23.200
&lrm;What?

07:23.480 --> 07:26.720
&lrm;Can't wait to hear...
&lrm;about this lucky girl.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.280
&lrm;[nervously] Yeah.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.360
<i>&lrm;-Tell her, It's you.</i>
&lrm;-It's youuu...

07:30.480 --> 07:32.160
&lrm;[Nino] uuur...

07:32.280 --> 07:33.840
&lrm;...your best friend Alya.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.800
&lrm;What?

07:35.120 --> 07:36.640
&lrm;Alya? Awesome.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.320
&lrm;No! No! It's not awesome.

07:39.480 --> 07:40.960
<i>&lrm;I can fix a date for you.</i>

07:41.080 --> 07:44.240
&lrm;Say what! Seriously?
&lrm;You didn't even ask me!

07:44.360 --> 07:47.320
&lrm;No way. Nino's like a brother to me.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.520
<i>&lrm;No! End of discussion.</i>

07:49.640 --> 07:52.400
&lrm;-He'll be so sad.
&lrm;-What did you say?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.240
&lrm;I said...
&lrm;it'll be sad not to tell her.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.120
&lrm;Animan,

08:05.240 --> 08:06.640
&lrm;I am Hawk Moth.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.520
&lrm;I offer you the power to seek revenge...

08:09.640 --> 08:11.040
&lrm;for a small price.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.760
&lrm;[evil voice] Yes, Hawk Moth.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.200
&lrm;[growling]

08:24.640 --> 08:27.240
&lrm;Hey, kiddo, still up for a race?

08:27.560 --> 08:29.720
&lrm;Go ahead, I'll give you a head start.

08:29.840 --> 08:30.800
&lrm;[roaring]

08:31.160 --> 08:32.080
&lrm;[screaming]

08:32.960 --> 08:34.360
&lrm;He's mine.

08:35.360 --> 08:38.320
<i>&lrm;This whole date thing with Nino</i>
<i>&lrm;is not happening!</i>

08:38.720 --> 08:40.760
&lrm;[screaming] He's coming!

08:42.159 --> 08:43.840
&lrm;[Nino screams]
&lrm;[elephant trumpets]

08:44.480 --> 08:45.480
&lrm;[roaring]

08:45.600 --> 08:47.440
&lrm;We'd better ditch this place.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.160
&lrm;Why didn't you listen to Alya?

08:56.280 --> 08:58.880
&lrm;I couldn't help it.
&lrm;I didn't want Nino to be sad.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.960
&lrm;We'll deal with that later.
&lrm;It's time to transform.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.960
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

09:20.680 --> 09:22.240
&lrm;We've got to do something.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.400
&lrm;[sigh]

09:23.640 --> 09:25.240
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

09:41.440 --> 09:44.960
&lrm;You lost, kiddo.
&lrm;What do you think of panthers now?

09:45.240 --> 09:47.520
&lrm;[whimpering] That panthers are the best.

09:47.640 --> 09:49.800
&lrm;What do you think about ladybugs?

09:49.920 --> 09:51.240
&lrm;And another black cat?

09:51.520 --> 09:53.600
&lrm;I think I'm higher on the food chain.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.640
&lrm;Animan, take their jewels.
&lrm;their Miraculouses.

09:57.080 --> 09:57.920
&lrm;Bring them to me!

09:58.160 --> 10:00.680
&lrm;If you value your life,
&lrm;get out of here now.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.480
&lrm;Cat Noir,
&lrm;the Akuma must be inside his bracelet.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.600
&lrm;You hold him. I'll grab the bracelet.

10:14.800 --> 10:15.680
&lrm;[roaring] Attack!

10:19.560 --> 10:21.600
&lrm;We need to get them back in their cages.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.160
&lrm;Really?
&lrm;I'm sure they won't put up a fight.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.880
&lrm;We'd better split up.

10:32.560 --> 10:33.680
&lrm;What the...?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.320
&lrm;Stay put, you'll be safe.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.320
&lrm;Hey, what's up?

10:46.680 --> 10:48.120
&lrm;[Ladybug] There are too many.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.800
&lrm;We can't capture them all.

10:49.920 --> 10:51.520
&lrm;What are we gonna do?

10:53.040 --> 10:53.880
&lrm;Back to plan A.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.840
&lrm;If we can destroy his bracelet,
&lrm;I can capture the Akuma.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.800
&lrm;-Everything will go back to normal.
&lrm;-Good idea.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.160
&lrm;-But it's unbreakable.
&lrm;-He didn't break it.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.280
&lrm;-How did he get away?
&lrm;-I don't know.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.760
&lrm;We'd better find Kim...
&lrm;I mean that boy, before he does.

11:25.280 --> 11:26.240
&lrm;Over there.

11:27.640 --> 11:28.640
&lrm;[Kim whimpers]

11:28.760 --> 11:30.440
&lrm;[growling]

11:30.600 --> 11:32.640
&lrm;It's down to the two of us, kiddo.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.240
&lrm;[Animan] And then there was one.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.720
&lrm;You're not getting away this time.

11:41.560 --> 11:44.080
&lrm;Quick,
&lrm;hide in the first place you come to.

11:45.920 --> 11:47.680
&lrm;You'll never get me.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
&lrm;[bubbling]

11:54.560 --> 11:56.560
&lrm;[eagle screams]

11:56.760 --> 11:59.680
&lrm;-Now we know how it got away.
&lrm;-Where's Kim?

12:00.200 --> 12:01.280
&lrm;[bleeping]

12:01.760 --> 12:03.080
&lrm;Good job, kitty.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.640
&lrm;[sobbing] Help! Rescue me, please.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.080
&lrm;It's OK. Come this way.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.640
&lrm;[snarling]

12:17.520 --> 12:18.680
&lrm;He's safe here.

12:18.840 --> 12:20.640
&lrm;Panthers can't open doors.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.840
&lrm;But what if he morphs
&lrm;into a smaller animal, like a mouse?

12:25.960 --> 12:29.240
&lrm;Right...
&lrm;but we have an advantage over him.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.320
&lrm;We know where to find his prey.

12:31.680 --> 12:36.120
&lrm;He'll sniff him eventually
&lrm;but it's bought us some time.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.040
&lrm;[bear groans]

12:42.160 --> 12:43.760
&lrm;[he screams]

12:44.080 --> 12:46.840
&lrm;We must stop Animan
&lrm;before Paris becomes a jungle.

12:46.960 --> 12:47.960
&lrm;[Ladybug] Follow me.

12:50.440 --> 12:51.960
&lrm;Hi, mo... madam.

12:52.280 --> 12:53.360
&lrm;But you're...

12:54.480 --> 12:55.440
&lrm;You're Ladybug.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.240
&lrm;Yeah, exactly.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.960
<i>&lrm;This is a special news flash.</i>

13:02.560 --> 13:04.160
<i>&lrm;Animals are invading Paris.</i>

13:04.280 --> 13:07.120
<i>&lrm;The police are hard at work</i>
<i>&lrm;trying to contain the situation.</i>

13:07.240 --> 13:09.760
<i>&lrm;Stay indoors and remain calm.</i>

13:10.000 --> 13:11.560
<i>&lrm;Mayor Bourgeois will...</i>

13:12.320 --> 13:13.160
&lrm;You're safe here.

13:13.760 --> 13:14.600
&lrm;Can I borrow this?

13:14.720 --> 13:15.960
&lrm;Sure.

13:18.920 --> 13:19.760
&lrm;Come on, Cat Noir.

13:20.120 --> 13:21.760
&lrm;Lock the doors and windows.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.720
&lrm;We'll do the rest. You'll be safe.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.240
&lrm;Thanks, da... sir,
&lrm;for all your help.

13:27.520 --> 13:29.120
&lrm;You're welcome, Ladybug.

13:32.760 --> 13:33.600
&lrm;And voilà.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.720
&lrm;What's that stuff?

13:43.040 --> 13:45.800
&lrm;Air freshener. It'll cover our scents.

13:46.160 --> 13:50.160
&lrm;Thanks, I always wanted
&lrm;to smell like an ocean breeze.

13:51.800 --> 13:53.720
&lrm;Could we capture him in this?

13:53.840 --> 13:56.480
&lrm;Only until he turns into something bigger.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.640
&lrm;[she gasps]

13:58.240 --> 14:00.000
&lrm;Would that be big enough?

14:00.480 --> 14:02.480
&lrm;Yes, but how do we get him inside?

14:03.200 --> 14:04.600
&lrm;He's coming.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.800
&lrm;[eagle screams]

14:13.640 --> 14:15.680
&lrm;It's working. He's sniffing out Kim.

14:15.800 --> 14:16.640
&lrm;[sniffing]

14:17.400 --> 14:18.400
&lrm;[he giggles]

14:18.520 --> 14:19.640
&lrm;Follow me.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.680
&lrm;[eagle screams]

14:33.040 --> 14:34.920
&lrm;A ladybug? Smart choice.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.320
&lrm;Couldn't he have chosen a slower animal?

14:42.040 --> 14:43.480
&lrm;[growling]

14:44.040 --> 14:49.040
&lrm;[snarling]

14:57.280 --> 14:59.280
&lrm;Where's the button for the doors?

15:02.200 --> 15:03.400
&lrm;Of course,

15:03.520 --> 15:04.840
&lrm;there's no key.

15:14.920 --> 15:18.320
&lrm;Take his Miraculous, the ring, the ring!

15:31.840 --> 15:34.600
&lrm;The transformations are tiring him out.

15:35.120 --> 15:38.120
&lrm;It'll be easier to get his Akuma.

15:39.600 --> 15:40.840
&lrm;Cataclysm!

15:47.080 --> 15:50.920
&lrm;[bleeping]

15:53.280 --> 15:54.520
&lrm;[explosion]

15:55.240 --> 15:58.040
&lrm;It's not exactly a cage but... it'll do.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.560
&lrm;I don't think he can "bear"
&lrm;to listen to that noise.

16:04.720 --> 16:07.400
&lrm;You're too much to bear.
&lrm;Now we wait.

16:12.200 --> 16:13.360
&lrm;Ready to free the Akuma?

16:18.160 --> 16:19.040
&lrm;It's working.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.840
&lrm;[gasping]

16:24.640 --> 16:25.760
&lrm;[crashing]

16:33.760 --> 16:35.760
&lrm;Since when do extinct animals count?

16:35.880 --> 16:39.760
&lrm;T-Rex might be extinct
&lrm;but it's still an animal.

16:44.600 --> 16:47.760
&lrm;I know some other animals that will soon
&lrm;be extinct, the cat and the ladybug!

17:01.640 --> 17:03.000
&lrm;Lucky charm!

17:09.240 --> 17:10.079
&lrm;A car jack?

17:10.400 --> 17:12.599
&lrm;Too bad he doesn't have a flat tire.

17:13.079 --> 17:15.280
&lrm;Look how small his front arms are.

17:15.480 --> 17:18.119
&lrm;So he can't play basketball.
&lrm;What are you getting at?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.680
&lrm;Climb on top of him
&lrm;where he can't get you.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.319
&lrm;While you're distracting him
&lrm;I'll floor him.

17:23.440 --> 17:24.599
&lrm;Sounds like a plan.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.000
&lrm;I can be very distracting.

17:27.319 --> 17:28.160
&lrm;[she groans]

17:30.160 --> 17:31.880
&lrm;[Cat Noir] It's gonna be tight.

17:34.840 --> 17:37.840
&lrm;[Cat Noir yells]

17:47.800 --> 17:50.880
&lrm;It's weird we didn't need this.
&lrm;What does it mean?

17:51.000 --> 17:53.080
&lrm;I guess it means we rock as a team.

17:54.440 --> 17:55.280
&lrm;Wait!

17:58.080 --> 17:59.120
&lrm;I know what to do.

17:59.240 --> 18:00.560
&lrm;Ladybug!

18:00.680 --> 18:01.920
&lrm;Enjoy your meal!

18:02.600 --> 18:04.880
&lrm;[roaring]

18:09.360 --> 18:10.600
&lrm;No!

18:12.720 --> 18:14.000
&lrm;You'll pay for this!

18:28.840 --> 18:30.960
&lrm;No more evil-doing for you,
&lrm;little Akuma.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.440
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:39.760 --> 18:41.000
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:42.280 --> 18:43.760
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly.

18:44.560 --> 18:46.360
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

18:57.560 --> 18:59.280
&lrm;-Pound it?
&lrm;-Ladybug!

18:59.920 --> 19:01.200
&lrm;That was a wild ride.

19:01.360 --> 19:02.920
&lrm;[they chuckle]

19:03.040 --> 19:04.320
&lrm;[bleeping]
&lrm;Woops.

19:04.720 --> 19:06.160
&lrm;Better take off.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.440
&lrm;See you next time, Cat Noir.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.360
&lrm;-What happened to me?
&lrm;-Everything's OK.

19:14.480 --> 19:16.920
&lrm;Go back to the zoo
&lrm;to check on your animals.

19:17.320 --> 19:19.840
&lrm;You ruined everything, Ladybug.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.280
&lrm;This is not how it was supposed to end!

19:22.560 --> 19:23.800
&lrm;But, I promise you,

19:23.960 --> 19:27.040
&lrm;one day it will be me
&lrm;at the top of the food chain

19:27.160 --> 19:29.240
&lrm;and you'll be nothing!

19:37.880 --> 19:40.760
&lrm;[phone rings]

19:41.280 --> 19:43.520
&lrm;No, I forgot about Alya.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.400
&lrm;She's gonna be so mad.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.680
&lrm;Imagine if she knew

19:46.800 --> 19:49.640
&lrm;you shut her up in the cage with Nino.

19:49.760 --> 19:52.160
&lrm;[phone continues]
&lrm;Yeah, she'd kill me.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.040
&lrm;Guess I'll take mad.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.280
&lrm;Listen Alya, I'm sorry about earlier.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.880
&lrm;I shouldn't have told Nino
&lrm;I'd set up a date.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.440
&lrm;I wasn't thinking.

20:01.560 --> 20:04.840
&lrm;I'll explain everything to him
&lrm;so don't worry.

20:04.960 --> 20:06.160
&lrm;Do you forgive me?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.360
&lrm;[they giggle]

20:10.120 --> 20:11.000
&lrm;Thanks, Nino.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.040
&lrm;Do you want one?

20:13.400 --> 20:15.480
&lrm;What's he doing here?

20:15.600 --> 20:18.440
&lrm;Ladybug shut us
&lrm;in the same cage all afternoon.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.320
&lrm;Turns out, we've tons in common.

20:20.880 --> 20:23.280
&lrm;You know, the girl I've a crush on...

20:23.400 --> 20:24.680
&lrm;Oh, yeah.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.440
&lrm;Actually, it was you.

20:27.720 --> 20:30.440
&lrm;That's what I thought
&lrm;but after being with Alya,

20:30.600 --> 20:33.120
&lrm;We don't have to give her all the details.

20:33.280 --> 20:34.480
&lrm;My bad.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.880
&lrm;The funniest part
&lrm;was that Nino was being coached

20:38.000 --> 20:40.520
&lrm;-by Adrien.
&lrm;-Adrien was there?

20:40.760 --> 20:42.120
&lrm;Yeah, lol.

20:42.240 --> 20:45.120
&lrm;Alya tells me
&lrm;you're crushin' on some dude.

20:46.480 --> 20:49.280
&lrm;He doesn't know who,
&lrm;pinkie swear because...

20:49.920 --> 20:52.200
&lrm;I don't make decisions for other people.

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
&lrm;If you want I can make it happen.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.520
&lrm;-That is if I know the dude.
&lrm;-Nino!

20:58.160 --> 20:59.640
&lrm;Fine, forget I said anything.

20:59.760 --> 21:01.160
&lrm;But if I can help...

21:01.520 --> 21:02.600
&lrm;[Alya] Nino!
