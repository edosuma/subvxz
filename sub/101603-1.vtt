03:42.890 --> 03:46.694
40,000 years ago at the
end of the last ice age,

03:46.728 --> 03:50.263
temperatures climbed and climbed
in the Los Angeles basin,

03:50.297 --> 03:53.568
giving rise to new species
of plants and animals.

03:53.601 --> 03:56.971
New predators attacked new prey.

03:57.004 --> 04:00.141
But something else rose
as the heat swelled.

04:00.174 --> 04:05.179
A hot, sticky and seemingly
endless seepage from the ground.

04:05.947 --> 04:08.248
Tar.

04:11.786 --> 04:15.590
As decades passed, the
tar pit grew and grew.

04:15.623 --> 04:18.860
The animals came but never left.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.663
Slowly sucked into
the steaming hot tar.

04:22.697 --> 04:24.264
Thousands of years later,

04:24.297 --> 04:27.068
early Native Americans
settled in the area.

04:27.101 --> 04:30.805
Villagers nearby used the
tar as sealant for canoes,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.540
baskets and huts.

04:32.573 --> 04:36.210
On one occasion, the villagers
were having a celebration,

04:36.244 --> 04:37.745
but in the morning,

04:37.779 --> 04:42.183
three of the tribesmen who had
ventured off were found dead,

04:42.216 --> 04:46.220
covered and suffocated
by the black substance.

04:46.254 --> 04:49.090
After this incident,
no one was permitted

04:49.123 --> 04:51.692
to go near the pit in the night.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.228
They called it Matchi-Manitou,

04:55.763 --> 04:57.098
the evil spirit.

04:59.700 --> 05:03.303
During the 20th century, a
sprawling urban metropolis

05:03.336 --> 05:07.008
buried the tar pit deep
below its concrete surfaces.

05:07.041 --> 05:10.711
Only a small open pit
remained, allowing excavators

05:10.745 --> 05:13.681
to sift through the trove
of ancient skeletons.

05:13.714 --> 05:16.751
Many new species were
discovered, but one,

05:16.784 --> 05:20.453
the elusive Matchi-Manitou,
was never found.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.891
And the urban
metropolis is the street

05:23.925 --> 05:27.695
you find yourself standing
on right here today.

05:27.728 --> 05:31.165
Right here on the
streets of Los Angeles.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.073
Yo, let's go. Come on.

06:12.106 --> 06:14.609
I've just gotta
hear it one more time.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.548
That's very kind
of you, good sir.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.351
40,000 years ago-

06:23.383 --> 06:25.418
- You really still
believe this shit?

06:25.452 --> 06:27.955
I'm not saying
that I believe it,

06:27.989 --> 06:30.057
but I don't not believe it.

06:30.091 --> 06:31.525
Your dad always talks about it.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.295
Yeah, my dad would always
say, "don't go in the tar pits"

06:34.328 --> 06:35.529
as a kid, but you know why?

06:35.563 --> 06:37.565
'Cause it's bad, it's
gross, it's sticky.

06:37.598 --> 06:39.233
It gets on your foot.

06:39.267 --> 06:40.668
You're such a pussy.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.206
Here's the deal, we
go and finish packing,

06:45.239 --> 06:47.241
and then tomorrow we're
not gonna be here anymore,

06:47.275 --> 06:50.578
so you can come all you want
and listen to this story.

06:50.611 --> 06:52.113
Come on, let's go.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.692
His eyes.

08:18.299 --> 08:21.635
I'll never forget
that look in his eyes.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.345
You know I always
wanna help you, Ben,

08:31.379 --> 08:32.847
but I can't get you her number.

08:32.880 --> 08:36.751
Come on, man! You've known
her for years, she trusts you.

08:36.784 --> 08:37.852
I love
you like a brother

08:37.885 --> 08:39.220
but I don't trust you with her.

08:39.253 --> 08:41.087
Whatever, man.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.959
Oh, hey, hey, hey!

08:44.992 --> 08:46.160
- Come here, come here.
- What's up?

08:46.193 --> 08:47.928
So, I'm sitting here packing,

08:47.962 --> 08:49.430
getting everything ready to go,

08:49.463 --> 08:50.965
and then something told me
"stop everything that you're

08:50.998 --> 08:54.869
doing and open the book" and
I did, right to this page.

08:54.902 --> 08:58.572
"On October 18th, an Aquarius
new moon," this is you,

08:58.606 --> 09:02.410
"lights up your eighth house
of intimacy and shared wealth.

09:02.443 --> 09:05.112
This is the second consecutive
new moon in Aquarius."

09:05.146 --> 09:09.216
The first was on, get
this, September 20th.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.985
Just like I said!

09:11.018 --> 09:12.486
Last week.

09:12.521 --> 09:15.456
I am going to
miss this so much.

09:15.489 --> 09:16.390
I know.

09:16.424 --> 09:18.426
Is my dad in?

09:21.796 --> 09:23.164
- Dad?
- Mm?

09:23.197 --> 09:25.433
I need the keys for
the workshop downstairs.

09:25.466 --> 09:26.367
Please?

09:26.400 --> 09:28.602
Isn't the please implied?

09:31.839 --> 09:34.575
So it's gonna be one
of those days, is it?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.277
What makes you think
because it's the last day here

09:36.310 --> 09:38.979
that it'll be any different
than any other day?

09:39.013 --> 09:39.847
Okay.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.189
Well?

09:48.222 --> 09:49.824
All right, let's do it.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.462
Through the legs.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.434
Again.

10:00.468 --> 10:01.635
Come on.

10:01.669 --> 10:04.738
You're stubborn,
just like your mother.

10:08.242 --> 10:11.278
No, I'm stubborn
just like you, Dad.

10:11.312 --> 10:15.316
Yeah, well, sorry for
giving you a livelihood.

10:17.251 --> 10:20.087
Yeah, you gave me a livelihood.
It just wasn't so lively.

10:20.121 --> 10:23.624
Putting computers back
together, rebuilding laptops,

10:23.657 --> 10:25.560
typewriters every so often.

10:25.594 --> 10:28.095
Tell me all about
all the offers

10:28.129 --> 10:30.097
that you got after
getting your degree.

10:30.131 --> 10:32.800
Tell me again, enlighten
me. Just for once.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.935
Sure, yeah, I'll
enlighten you that

10:34.969 --> 10:36.770
I could use a little
encouragement from my father.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.806
Is that what this
is all about, huh?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.274
Is there some sort
of resentment?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.510
No.

10:41.543 --> 10:43.043
Let me tell you
something, Zachary.

10:43.077 --> 10:47.848
I never resented my dad, who
worked his ass off, by the way,

10:47.882 --> 10:51.520
giving me all the advantages
and privileges that I received.

10:51.553 --> 10:52.720
I know.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.590
I never, ever
resented your mother.

10:55.624 --> 10:58.593
Now you're bringing
Mom into this?

11:08.235 --> 11:10.938
I'll just go get
back to packing.

11:16.076 --> 11:17.912
None of us knew.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.885
Definitely not Ben and Marigold.

11:28.222 --> 11:29.056
So?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.994
What's next after all this?

11:34.028 --> 11:35.429
Fuck if I know.

11:36.631 --> 11:37.532
You?

11:37.566 --> 11:40.167
I'm gonna open up my own shop.

11:40.201 --> 11:42.836
Gonna have candles and
cards and stuff in the front

11:42.870 --> 11:47.374
and people to do tarot and
read palms in the back.

11:47.408 --> 11:49.476
You know, you've
never done one of those

11:49.511 --> 11:51.745
weird handjob things on me.

11:53.147 --> 11:57.184
Really? I've given everybody
in this office a handjob.

11:57.218 --> 11:58.018
Let's see.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.188
Oh, wow.

12:01.222 --> 12:05.426
It looks like you're in for
a really unhappy ending.

12:06.961 --> 12:08.128
L.

12:08.162 --> 12:09.698
O.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.931
L.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.301
Come on, this desk
isn't gonna move itself.

12:14.335 --> 12:17.938
You and your magical
psychic mind-reading abilities

12:17.972 --> 12:19.773
levitate the desk outta here.

12:19.807 --> 12:21.742
Yeah, why didn't
I think of that?

12:21.775 --> 12:25.580
Dear spirits, help me move the
fat ass that's on the desk.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.115
Oh. Oh, wow, it's working.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.619
Dummy.

12:30.652 --> 12:32.353
- Come on.
- All right, you ready?

12:32.386 --> 12:34.355
One, two.

13:04.519 --> 13:09.490
Bobby used to drive me
nuts with that tennis ball.

13:10.391 --> 13:11.626
Hindsight's a funny gift.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.867
Is the 10:30
gonna be on time?

13:53.901 --> 13:55.836
If I can set
up the track in time.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.438
I think you will.

13:58.740 --> 14:00.074
Did you bring the
pick from the car?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.776
- It's on the table.
- Oh, all right.

14:01.810 --> 14:03.477
I see it. Thank you.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.715
10:27, 10:28, 10:29.

14:08.616 --> 14:10.351
10:30, right on time.

14:14.789 --> 14:16.591
Was that an earthquake, Papa?

14:16.624 --> 14:18.125
No, no, no. That was the
building across the way.

14:18.158 --> 14:19.159
Remember I told you?

14:19.193 --> 14:20.027
Barry.

14:21.796 --> 14:23.531
Do you know that building?

14:23.565 --> 14:24.632
That building's
gonna be something

14:24.666 --> 14:26.400
very special for this city.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.936
But I thought it
was just a museum?

14:30.904 --> 14:32.439
Yeah.

14:32.473 --> 14:35.242
To some people, that's special.

14:35.275 --> 14:40.280
I think it'd be special
if it was a train station.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.215
Yeah.

14:54.562 --> 14:55.396
Yeah.

15:23.691 --> 15:28.162
Barry, Sebastian
Sterling's here to see you.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.209
Hey, Barry. How are ya?

15:44.579 --> 15:47.247
You know it doesn't have
to be like this, Barry.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.216
This whole thing
could end amicably.

15:49.249 --> 15:50.718
No.

15:50.752 --> 15:51.920
No, Sebastian.

15:53.253 --> 15:56.423
With this deadline
that you're imposing,

15:56.457 --> 15:59.694
no, I don't think the word
amicable comes to mind.

15:59.727 --> 16:02.362
Right, the whole
two-week eviction notice,

16:02.396 --> 16:07.000
I mean, that was a tad
harsh, and you gotta get out.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.470
You know, but according
to the terms of the lease-

16:09.504 --> 16:12.039
- Yeah, the lease that
was written 65 years ago.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.175
It's a bit dated, but you
know, I've got lawyers, Barry.

16:15.209 --> 16:17.946
You know,
Sebastian, back then,

16:19.446 --> 16:21.916
they didn't need lawyers.

16:21.950 --> 16:24.318
You know what it was?
It was a handshake.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.185
That's it.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.535
My card.

16:40.568 --> 16:42.670
Take it, use it, call me.

16:43.771 --> 16:46.106
If you need me,
anything for you, okay?

16:46.139 --> 16:49.878
Anything, as long as
it's before six a.m.

17:09.061 --> 17:10.364
No way.

17:16.838 --> 17:19.205
"Science fair champ."

18:50.031 --> 18:52.800
Three generations
at that place.

18:55.069 --> 18:56.504
Greenwood Repair.

18:58.205 --> 19:01.042
And Papa and my
dad had that bond.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.813
I just wish that my dad
and I had more of a chance.

19:12.086 --> 19:13.487
Oh, hey, bud.

19:13.521 --> 19:16.156
Oh, that's, that's sad.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.525
It's really sad.

19:19.027 --> 19:20.427
Hey, man, I know.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.730
I know it's sad, but, you
know, I'll be hiring in a year.

19:22.764 --> 19:24.632
You're more than
welcome to apply.

19:26.034 --> 19:27.635
Yeah, I appreciate that.

19:27.669 --> 19:29.537
So what do we have
to do by six a.m.?

19:29.570 --> 19:31.973
What do you have to do by
six a.m.? Uh, everything.

19:32.006 --> 19:34.876
Everything must go.
Everything outta here, okay?

19:34.909 --> 19:38.946
The boxes, the schmudtas,
the mopey old men.

19:38.980 --> 19:40.480
Oh, you mean my dad?

19:40.515 --> 19:42.116
Your dad needs
to get outta here.

19:42.150 --> 19:45.086
The typewriter, gone. The
walls, the walls are filthy.

19:45.119 --> 19:46.888
Look, there is schmutz
all over these walls.

19:46.921 --> 19:49.289
They need to be cleaned,
carpets need to be shampooed.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.659
Paint needs to be
repainted, and the bathroom.

19:51.693 --> 19:53.326
Can we talk about the
bathroom for a second?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.630
I need it to smell
pristine,

19:55.663 --> 19:58.498
and if you don't adhere to all
of those things by six a.m.

19:58.533 --> 20:00.101
I'm gonna have to
refer to the lease.

20:00.134 --> 20:01.602
That's where I have
to take you to court,

20:01.636 --> 20:03.938
then I have to sue you,
then you have to pay me the-

20:03.971 --> 20:06.007
- $100,000. I know.

20:06.040 --> 20:07.542
Yeah, that you know.

20:07.575 --> 20:11.813
But it's getting torn down
in a month. Why do you care?

20:13.748 --> 20:15.215
That's just a rumor.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.584
Are you kidding
me? That's a fact.

20:16.617 --> 20:19.187
- No, that is a rumor.
- Ah, no. That's a fact.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.788
Don't go start
spreading rumors.

20:20.822 --> 20:22.690
This building is getting
torn down in a month.

20:22.724 --> 20:24.391
Hold on, got a call coming in.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.593
Hello?

20:25.626 --> 20:27.061
Hey, babe. Just going
through a tunnel.

20:27.095 --> 20:29.429
Listen, hey, it's just
procedure, young Greenwald.

20:29.463 --> 20:30.798
It's procedure.

20:30.832 --> 20:32.200
Oh, yeah, it's
procedure you wipe my ass.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.668
What was that?

20:33.701 --> 20:36.104
Nothin', I was just
going over the procedure.

20:36.137 --> 20:37.739
I got you covered.

20:37.772 --> 20:39.306
You're a good man, Greenwald.

20:39.339 --> 20:40.775
It's Greenwood.

20:40.808 --> 20:41.642
Greenwood.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.746
Hey, did you get my card?

21:14.108 --> 21:16.811
This isn't the
life I dreamed of.

21:21.883 --> 21:24.786
I wanted more
adventure in my life.

21:42.770 --> 21:45.273
Third year in a row.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.241
Sky's the limit.

21:47.275 --> 21:49.577
Someday this could be you.

21:49.610 --> 21:52.947
Like grandfather,
like father, like son.

21:55.082 --> 21:58.052
But then one year becomes
two and three and four

21:58.085 --> 22:02.824
and family obligations and
loyalty and then you're stuck.

23:50.798 --> 23:52.499
Oh, shit.

24:23.631 --> 24:24.464
Help!

24:26.167 --> 24:27.001
Somebody?

24:59.467 --> 25:00.835
Help me!

25:00.868 --> 25:01.702
Somebody!

25:02.803 --> 25:03.637
Anybody!

25:05.006 --> 25:05.840
Help me!

25:07.875 --> 25:09.377
Help me, somebody!

25:22.990 --> 25:25.426
I'm still not hungry, Ben.

25:25.459 --> 25:27.862
But I have your favorite.

25:27.895 --> 25:29.597
What're you doing here?

25:29.630 --> 25:34.402
Thought you might be hungry
so I brought you some food.

25:37.371 --> 25:39.573
It's so good to see you.

25:39.607 --> 25:41.942
And
look what you did.

25:52.019 --> 25:53.721
- Cucumber martini?
- No.

25:53.754 --> 25:55.189
Yes.

25:55.222 --> 25:57.258
You knew exactly
what I needed today.

25:58.859 --> 26:01.462
Okay, I'll just have one sip.

26:03.664 --> 26:05.733
So needed that.

26:05.766 --> 26:07.935
Look, I know it's been a
rough day for you and your dad.

26:07.968 --> 26:09.603
Yeah, what day is it?

26:09.637 --> 26:11.772
Come on, Zach, you
can't get away with those

26:11.806 --> 26:14.675
throwaway "woe is
me" lines anymore.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.210
Yeah.

26:16.243 --> 26:17.778
But you know what, Rose?
It's more than that.

26:17.812 --> 26:19.280
We never see eye to eye.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.048
I'll be up and he'll be down.

26:21.082 --> 26:23.751
Or he'll be up and I'll be down.

26:25.186 --> 26:27.588
I've been the third wheel in
that situation enough times,

26:27.621 --> 26:29.290
so trust me, I know.

26:30.458 --> 26:33.294
You know what? Tonight,
no third wheels, okay?

26:33.327 --> 26:35.096
Just two wheels.

26:35.129 --> 26:37.298
No third wheels, just...

26:38.199 --> 26:39.834
Two wheels.

26:51.679 --> 26:55.449
In your next life chapter,
you're gonna take center stage.

26:55.483 --> 26:56.984
That's what I've been saying.

26:57.017 --> 26:58.486
- You get me.
- No, I don't get you.

26:58.520 --> 26:59.987
The stars get you.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.456
They tell me what's going
on with you and I relay it.

27:02.490 --> 27:03.324
That's it.

27:04.391 --> 27:05.693
Hey.

27:05.726 --> 27:06.561
Hey.

27:09.663 --> 27:10.831
Sorry to bother you guys.

27:10.865 --> 27:13.434
Oh, no. You could
never be a bother to us.

27:16.137 --> 27:18.105
Oh, god, there must've
been another accident

27:18.139 --> 27:20.641
or something from that subway.

27:24.546 --> 27:26.380
Anyway, what's up?

27:26.413 --> 27:29.316
Yeah, so, I get
a little bit anal

27:30.384 --> 27:32.052
with these types of things,

27:32.086 --> 27:34.255
and I was wondering if
you had any more of that

27:34.288 --> 27:36.625
premium quality bubble wrap?

27:50.437 --> 27:51.272
Thanks.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.442
Really appreciate it.

27:55.476 --> 27:56.310
See ya.

28:00.414 --> 28:02.683
Can you get any creepier?

28:02.716 --> 28:06.487
Did you hear the way
she said "anal" to me?

28:12.627 --> 28:14.028
- Here you go.
- Oh!

28:14.061 --> 28:15.429
You didn't have to do
that. I could've done that.

28:15.462 --> 28:17.498
Oh, it's totally fine.
Don't worry about it.

28:17.532 --> 28:19.934
I'm almost done
packing the back office.

28:19.967 --> 28:22.736
I'll make sure that
it's packed tightly.

28:22.770 --> 28:25.439
- You really are the best.
- You really mean that?

28:25.472 --> 28:26.907
Of course I do.

28:26.941 --> 28:29.611
As soon as we move
and I hire new people,

28:29.644 --> 28:31.478
I'm bumping you up.

28:31.513 --> 28:34.081
Carmenia, I wouldn't be
where I am today without you.

28:34.114 --> 28:36.850
So, let's get going?

28:36.884 --> 28:40.120
Oh, right. Yeah,
I'll get right on that.

30:52.721 --> 30:55.255
Why isn't it working?

30:56.156 --> 30:59.460
Well, I don't know. Let's see.

30:59.493 --> 31:02.831
- You got it connected, yeah?
- Yeah.

31:02.863 --> 31:03.997
Is it tight?

31:05.132 --> 31:06.367
Let's see here.

31:09.470 --> 31:10.437
There we go.

31:17.645 --> 31:18.646
Papa?

31:18.680 --> 31:19.480
What?

31:19.514 --> 31:20.849
What was that?

31:22.851 --> 31:25.252
Just that construction.

31:25.285 --> 31:26.120
Really?

31:27.454 --> 31:30.124
Doesn't sound like construction.

31:41.335 --> 31:43.404
Motherfucking subway!

31:43.437 --> 31:44.938
Guess we can't do any more work.

31:44.972 --> 31:46.974
Hopefully the power
comes back on soon.

31:47.007 --> 31:48.909
Or not. Remember, what
was that, two weeks ago?

31:48.942 --> 31:50.678
It didn't come on
for like 45 minutes.

31:50.712 --> 31:52.079
What if it doesn't
come on again?

31:52.112 --> 31:55.717
You know what? Screw it,
maybe we should just go.

31:55.750 --> 31:57.918
Yeah, so let's
all go have a drink,

31:57.951 --> 32:00.120
because Zach here's gonna
front the 100 grand.

32:00.154 --> 32:02.055
Come on, I was just saying,
you know, even Sebastian.

32:02.089 --> 32:03.625
He probably wouldn't want
us to move in the dark.

32:03.658 --> 32:06.360
Yes, he will.

32:06.393 --> 32:08.095
I'm afraid we have
no choice, okay?

32:08.128 --> 32:09.396
But someone's gonna get hurt.

32:09.430 --> 32:11.031
I don't want Marigold
to move in the dark.

32:11.064 --> 32:15.169
Or Ben, I don't want him
to move in the light.

32:15.202 --> 32:17.705
It was my grandfather, it
was your great-grandfather,

32:17.739 --> 32:19.874
he kinda had to leave
Europe in a hurry.

32:19.908 --> 32:22.577
He was a stowaway in the
belly of a cargo ship.

32:22.610 --> 32:25.412
Two weeks on the
Atlantic, pitch black.

32:25.446 --> 32:26.648
Hey, hey.

32:26.681 --> 32:30.217
So now you are afraid
to lift a few boxes

32:30.250 --> 32:32.085
in the dark, is that right?

32:32.119 --> 32:33.521
Is that how I raised you?

32:33.555 --> 32:34.823
You're right, but you
also didn't raise me

32:34.856 --> 32:36.624
with an extra 100
grand to spare, Dad.

32:36.658 --> 32:37.926
Really?

32:37.958 --> 32:39.894
Is that the way we really want
to spend our last night here?

32:39.928 --> 32:42.062
Arguing with all
this negativity?

32:42.095 --> 32:44.599
Let's just turn around,
be a little positive,

32:44.632 --> 32:46.200
and do what we have to do.

32:46.233 --> 32:48.937
And I can help you
with whatever you need.

32:48.969 --> 32:49.904
I know.

32:49.938 --> 32:50.772
Ben.

32:55.309 --> 32:59.413
Sorry for talking
back, we'll go pack.

32:59.446 --> 33:01.683
It's okay. That's my boy.

33:11.659 --> 33:14.394
If you're gonna do nothing,
at least do it quietly.

33:14.428 --> 33:16.898
I hear words, but I'm
night-blind, so I can't-

33:16.931 --> 33:18.967
- Yeah, huh?

33:28.041 --> 33:32.514
Rose never should've turned
up at the office that night.

33:32.547 --> 33:34.448
Mom got me this.

33:34.481 --> 33:36.183
Dad got me this.

33:36.216 --> 33:39.654
Wait, I remember the
day I got this picture.

33:41.956 --> 33:45.225
She wasn't even
supposed to be in town.

33:52.332 --> 33:53.166
Love you.

33:56.804 --> 33:59.139
Biggest mistake of her life.

34:06.781 --> 34:10.183
I
need to take five.

34:10.217 --> 34:11.385
Why?

34:11.418 --> 34:13.387
Exhaustion.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.221
Really?

34:15.889 --> 34:20.159
I'm not gonna sit
here and do this by myself.

34:24.197 --> 34:25.197
Ah, fuck it.

34:29.971 --> 34:31.940
I didn't say anything earlier
because you were kinda being

34:31.973 --> 34:34.842
a douche when we were moving
the desk, but I won two tickets

34:34.876 --> 34:37.978
to the zoo in the Ralph's
Grocery Store drawing.

34:38.012 --> 34:41.181
And I know that you
like the meerkats.

34:44.552 --> 34:47.353
I love those meerkats.

34:47.387 --> 34:48.590
Anyway, they're only valid

34:48.623 --> 34:50.024
the first Tuesday
of every month.

34:50.058 --> 34:51.859
I'm gonna go Tuesday after next.

34:51.893 --> 34:53.995
Wait, did you see that?

34:56.864 --> 34:58.198
Dude, you're paranoid.

34:58.231 --> 34:59.567
You're paranoid!

34:59.601 --> 35:01.368
I'm not the one who
said I saw anything.

35:01.401 --> 35:04.939
Shh! Now you're being
defensive and paranoid.

35:04.973 --> 35:06.808
It's probably Diana.

35:40.440 --> 35:43.176
I think it was over here, yeah?

36:27.689 --> 36:29.090
It was you two.

36:31.592 --> 36:33.027
I know her shadow.

36:33.061 --> 36:35.563
What we saw definitely
was not that.

36:35.596 --> 36:37.932
Wait, you guys saw something?

36:37.965 --> 36:40.233
I saw something but I
thought it was you guys.

36:40.267 --> 36:43.871
No, we were in
our reception area.

36:43.905 --> 36:46.708
Maybe it's the girl that works
with you, that Carmen girl.

36:46.741 --> 36:47.942
Carmenia?

36:47.975 --> 36:50.912
No, she's in the back, packing.

36:50.945 --> 36:52.212
If it wasn't us
and it wasn't you

36:52.245 --> 36:54.048
then what the hell was it?

36:54.082 --> 36:55.817
Girls, girls. Come
here, come here.

36:55.850 --> 36:58.152
Listen, I know it's scary.

36:58.186 --> 37:00.855
Don't worry, I've got
this all under con...

37:06.761 --> 37:08.096
That was a drill, right?

37:08.129 --> 37:10.164
Yeah, it's like a
bulldozer or something,

37:10.198 --> 37:13.835
but come hang out in
reception with us.

37:37.792 --> 37:38.626
Really?

37:39.660 --> 37:42.329
What the fuck was that?

37:42.362 --> 37:43.831
It felt like the
building burped.

37:43.865 --> 37:46.601
It was probably
just the subway construction.

37:46.634 --> 37:47.969
What happened to that light?

37:48.002 --> 37:49.237
Dude, relax.

37:49.269 --> 37:51.706
You relax! Remember
before it was darker?

37:51.739 --> 37:53.608
And then now it's
flickering and-

37:53.641 --> 37:56.010
- When did you become
such a crazy drama queen?

37:56.043 --> 37:58.613
You're a drama queen! Everyone
here needs to calm down!

37:58.646 --> 38:00.882
Everybody just calm down.

38:00.915 --> 38:03.316
Everything's gonna be okay.

38:04.484 --> 38:05.853
Yeah, no. I know.

38:05.887 --> 38:08.256
Everything's fine.
Everyone's cool, I'm cool.

38:08.321 --> 38:09.824
I'm on top of this.

38:09.857 --> 38:12.093
No offense, babe, but
you don't really seem

38:12.126 --> 38:14.394
like the kind of guy
who's on top of anything.

38:14.427 --> 38:15.530
She has a point.

38:15.563 --> 38:18.633
When I look like
actually into your soul,

38:18.666 --> 38:20.300
I don't see a guy
who's on top of things.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.103
I just see a giant vagina.

38:22.136 --> 38:24.205
That's uncalled for.

38:24.238 --> 38:26.874
I can handle this. Wait,
can you keep doing that?

38:26.908 --> 38:28.276
I mean, if you want.

38:28.308 --> 38:30.278
How about when you
do something manly,

38:30.310 --> 38:32.246
then I'll keep
rubbing your back?

38:32.280 --> 38:33.915
Okay, how about this?

38:33.948 --> 38:35.917
I save your life,
you make out with me.

38:35.950 --> 38:38.485
I think you have a better
shot with the zoo animals.

38:38.519 --> 38:40.588
Like oo-oo, ah-ah.

38:40.621 --> 38:42.489
Seriously, I think
that's a fair exchange.

38:42.523 --> 38:43.858
Your life for...

38:45.626 --> 38:47.628
Your tongue in my mouth.

38:52.300 --> 38:53.868
Statistically speaking,
I feel like there's

38:53.901 --> 38:55.870
a higher chance of me
getting struck by lightning

38:55.903 --> 38:58.739
and winning the lottery in the
same day, than you actually

38:58.773 --> 39:02.844
stepping up to the plate
and saving anyone, so...

39:04.212 --> 39:05.746
Why not?

39:05.780 --> 39:06.948
Shake on it?

39:09.050 --> 39:10.218
Shake on it.

39:12.086 --> 39:14.188
Has anybody seen Zach?

39:22.263 --> 39:24.198
Wait, where is
the drink shaker?

39:24.232 --> 39:25.333
Nervous?

39:25.365 --> 39:26.868
Maybe just a little,
with all that's going on.

39:26.901 --> 39:28.468
You need a drink.

39:30.872 --> 39:32.472
- Better?
- Oh, come here.

39:39.747 --> 39:41.182
Huh? What?

39:41.215 --> 39:45.152
No! Dad!

39:45.186 --> 39:46.187
Seriously?

39:47.588 --> 39:48.990
My dick.

39:53.895 --> 39:55.563
Let's go. Come on, right now.

39:55.596 --> 39:56.731
What's going on?

39:56.764 --> 39:57.965
I've got everything
under control.

39:57.999 --> 39:59.667
We just have a little situation.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.736
But isn't it the
subway or it was-

40:01.769 --> 40:03.436
- No, no, no. Listen.

40:03.470 --> 40:05.840
I will explain
everything in a moment.

40:05.873 --> 40:08.276
Right now we just all
have to work together.

40:08.309 --> 40:11.178
But we are working together.

40:11.212 --> 40:13.748
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

40:13.781 --> 40:15.383
Let's go.

40:21.155 --> 40:22.523
Yo, I saw something.

40:22.556 --> 40:24.992
I saw a shadow, there is
someone or something out there.

40:25.026 --> 40:26.459
I don't know what it is.

40:26.493 --> 40:28.362
Come on, guys, it's
probably just the subway.

40:28.396 --> 40:31.165
At this point it doesn't
even matter what it was, okay?

40:31.198 --> 40:32.767
We all heard what that
guy Sebastian said.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.502
We've really gotta start moving.

40:34.535 --> 40:36.671
I'll tell you exactly
what it is about Sebastian.

40:36.704 --> 40:38.940
He's a dick. That's
all you need to know.

40:38.973 --> 40:41.542
It doesn't matter.
Rules are still rules.

40:41.575 --> 40:43.511
You know what? I hate rules.

40:43.544 --> 40:45.546
Yeah, I know. I'm aware.

40:45.579 --> 40:48.582
Zach, it's kinda key that
you follow a few right now.

40:48.616 --> 40:50.084
Why?

40:50.117 --> 40:52.153
Because we all have to
work together, that's why.

40:52.186 --> 40:53.554
No more distractions.

40:53.587 --> 40:55.556
We didn't do anything.

40:57.258 --> 40:58.960
Now, we're not gonna
get anything accomplished,

40:58.993 --> 41:00.460
unless we have a plan.

41:00.493 --> 41:02.596
Why does it always have
to be your plan, Dad?

41:02.630 --> 41:04.065
I have a plan, okay?

41:04.098 --> 41:06.567
We're gonna take the
flashlights that you brought us,

41:06.600 --> 41:09.036
we pack and we get outta here.

41:09.070 --> 41:11.471
There you go, that's
the plan. Thank you.

41:13.507 --> 41:14.642
- Zach?
- What?

41:15.810 --> 41:17.645
Would you just come out
in the other room with me?

41:17.678 --> 41:18.478
Why?

41:20.480 --> 41:22.316
Because I need to
tell you something.

41:22.350 --> 41:25.485
Everybody else, just
chill. We'll be right back.

41:25.519 --> 41:27.922
Zach, would you come with me?

41:31.092 --> 41:32.693
No.

41:32.727 --> 41:33.561
No.

41:36.964 --> 41:37.865
Sit down.

41:39.066 --> 41:40.935
What now, Dad?

41:40.968 --> 41:41.802
What?

41:43.904 --> 41:45.406
What?

41:45.439 --> 41:49.143
First off, I want
you to calm down.

41:49.176 --> 41:51.946
Listen, there's something
I wanna tell you.

41:51.979 --> 41:56.283
I gotta figure this out just
in case it's something else.

41:56.317 --> 41:57.752
Something else?

41:57.785 --> 42:00.321
Yeah, there's just something
else I gotta check out,

42:00.354 --> 42:03.190
but what I need you to do is
I need you to stay in the room

42:03.224 --> 42:05.292
and keep everything
in order, okay?

42:05.326 --> 42:08.362
Can you do that for me? Can
you do that for your mother?

42:08.396 --> 42:12.099
I've been doing this
for Mom for 10 years, Dad.

42:12.133 --> 42:14.435
Ever since the day she...

42:16.704 --> 42:20.074
Do you, listen,
do you remember...

42:20.107 --> 42:23.010
It was a little league
semi-final game,

42:23.044 --> 42:25.813
and you were really
frustrated with me.

42:25.846 --> 42:27.248
The game where you
were mouthing off

42:27.281 --> 42:28.916
and the ump almost kicked
you out of the game?

42:28.949 --> 42:32.086
Yeah. Yeah, I was,
but you're my son.

42:32.119 --> 42:33.421
- You won the game.
- Yeah.

42:33.454 --> 42:35.990
- You went to the finals.
- Yeah.

42:36.023 --> 42:40.761
Once again, you're upset.
You don't wanna play.

42:40.795 --> 42:42.263
But you pulled it together.

42:42.296 --> 42:45.866
You said "I'm gonna
do this for the team."

42:45.900 --> 42:47.134
Right?

42:47.168 --> 42:48.002
You.

42:49.303 --> 42:51.172
You did for the team.

42:51.205 --> 42:52.039
Yeah.

42:53.407 --> 42:56.444
So you come out the dugout,
you had confidence, man.

42:56.477 --> 42:59.947
You step into the
box and you dig in.

42:59.980 --> 43:00.881
First pitch.

43:00.915 --> 43:02.016
Boom!

43:02.049 --> 43:04.985
- It was a great moment.
- Great moment.

43:06.921 --> 43:08.756
This is another
one of those moments.

43:08.789 --> 43:11.659
Now I really need
you to stay here.

43:11.692 --> 43:15.029
Don't let anybody
leave, can you do that?

43:16.931 --> 43:18.299
Okay.

43:18.332 --> 43:19.733
Yeah, that a boy.

43:25.106 --> 43:25.940
Yeah.

43:45.993 --> 43:48.829
Thought I'd never
see him again.

43:50.565 --> 43:52.133
Just like with Mom.

44:06.847 --> 44:07.681
Miss D?

44:15.122 --> 44:15.990
Miss Diana?

45:22.289 --> 45:24.024
What the...

45:35.402 --> 45:40.307
I got it. You got the tape?

45:49.783 --> 45:50.951
Get in here.

45:50.985 --> 45:53.120
Come here, Barry.

45:53.153 --> 45:55.155
Nobody's here. I want you
to stay right here, okay?

45:55.189 --> 45:56.524
I'm coming back.

45:57.758 --> 46:00.194
Okay? Stay here, you hear me?

46:34.995 --> 46:36.230
Keep it closed.

46:37.197 --> 46:38.700
Everything's fine.

46:39.967 --> 46:41.536
I'll be right back.

47:15.637 --> 47:16.470
Shit!

47:17.338 --> 47:18.172
Damn it!

47:28.282 --> 47:30.250
I will not let fear control me.

47:30.284 --> 47:32.853
I will not let fear control me.

47:39.694 --> 47:41.161
I should really
go check on Carmenia.

47:41.195 --> 47:42.296
Wait. No, Diana.

47:42.329 --> 47:43.330
Diana, stop.

47:45.567 --> 47:46.768
You gotta stay here.

47:46.801 --> 47:48.235
Why?

47:48.268 --> 47:50.371
I told my dad that I'd make
sure everyone stayed here.

47:50.404 --> 47:52.507
So everyone stays here,
nobody goes anywhere.

47:52.540 --> 47:55.342
Okay, I get it and
I respect your dad,

47:55.376 --> 47:57.512
but he also said when he
left that he'd be right back

47:57.545 --> 48:00.013
and it's, it's been
more than half an hour.

48:00.047 --> 48:02.116
- I know, I know, I know.
- I think everybody's fine.

48:02.149 --> 48:03.384
I think they're both fine.

48:03.417 --> 48:07.321
Oh, my god.

48:07.354 --> 48:09.957
Okay, I gotta go have a look.

48:12.159 --> 48:13.360
I'll be right back.

48:13.394 --> 48:14.228
Really?

48:16.029 --> 48:18.566
It was probably just the subway.

48:18.600 --> 48:21.536
That's one fucked up subway.

48:29.878 --> 48:32.881
My dad always had
all the answers.

48:37.451 --> 48:39.621
But now he had no answers.

48:40.755 --> 48:41.589
None.

48:50.230 --> 48:51.064
Dad?

49:01.341 --> 49:02.510
You okay, Dad?

49:14.988 --> 49:15.857
What the...

49:33.340 --> 49:34.509
What the hell?

49:50.658 --> 49:51.492
Dad?

49:54.094 --> 49:55.663
Dad, where are you?

50:38.472 --> 50:40.575
Shit!

51:10.103 --> 51:11.371
Hello.

51:11.405 --> 51:15.009
So, how long have you
and Zach been together?

51:15.043 --> 51:19.981
Um, three years and three
months to the day, actually.

51:21.114 --> 51:22.382
Happy anniversary.

51:22.416 --> 51:24.318
Thank you.

51:24.351 --> 51:25.853
Boom! War!

51:27.055 --> 51:28.288
Yes!

51:28.322 --> 51:30.692
What about you?
Do you have a guy?

51:30.725 --> 51:32.694
I'm married to
my work.

51:32.727 --> 51:33.861
You don't think
that there's like

51:33.895 --> 51:35.563
a Mr. Right out there for you?

51:35.597 --> 51:37.464
You see these?

51:37.497 --> 51:39.499
It's kinda hard
not to.

51:39.534 --> 51:42.269
They're a blessing and
a curse at the same time.

51:42.302 --> 51:44.137
Sometimes I feel like they can

51:44.171 --> 51:47.742
stop people from
seeing the real me.

51:47.775 --> 51:49.476
Boom! War!

51:49.510 --> 51:51.512
- Deal it.
- You deal it.

52:12.900 --> 52:15.503
Fuck.

52:19.239 --> 52:20.074
Oh, shit!

52:23.044 --> 52:24.612
He's not answering.

52:24.646 --> 52:26.948
Don't worry, Rose. He's
probably just dropping a deuce.

52:26.981 --> 52:28.816
Doesn't want you
to know about it.

52:28.850 --> 52:30.718
That's disgusting.

52:38.092 --> 52:39.326
So?

52:39.359 --> 52:41.596
Why are you doing all this?

52:43.097 --> 52:44.398
- Doing what?
- This!

52:44.431 --> 52:46.668
There's black tarry
stuff on the ground,

52:46.701 --> 52:48.803
you've been making all those
noises, the power's out.

52:48.836 --> 52:50.437
Why are you doing all this, huh?

52:50.470 --> 52:51.639
Oh, no, boy.

52:52.874 --> 52:56.911
I wish it was me doing
it, but it ain't.

52:56.944 --> 52:59.446
No, no. It most
definitely ain't.

52:59.479 --> 53:03.417
Well, if it ain't you,
then why are you here?

53:05.419 --> 53:07.955
Well, the sidewalk gets cold.

53:07.989 --> 53:09.824
Man's gotta stay warm at night.

53:09.857 --> 53:11.926
Wait, these are mine.

53:11.959 --> 53:14.095
I looked for these for
two weeks a year ago.

53:14.128 --> 53:17.098
And a most
enjoyable year it was.

53:17.131 --> 53:18.365
Much appreciated.

53:18.398 --> 53:20.101
Oh, you want me to
fluff your pillow too?

53:21.301 --> 53:22.136
Yeah.

53:23.336 --> 53:26.206
What is all this shit anyway?

53:33.815 --> 53:35.083
You see this?

53:47.195 --> 53:48.696
This is the truth.

53:55.503 --> 53:58.305
This is what's
going on out there.

54:11.185 --> 54:15.757
I always thought Papa's
bedtime stories were just that.

54:15.790 --> 54:16.891
Just stories.

54:18.793 --> 54:19.627
But...

54:21.596 --> 54:22.764
There's clues.

54:25.099 --> 54:27.835
'Cause he'd always say that

54:27.869 --> 54:29.737
in every story there's
a kernel of truth.

54:35.510 --> 54:36.343
Shh.

54:39.614 --> 54:42.415
You're mad. You
know that, right?

54:42.449 --> 54:47.287
Well, you can call me what
you will, but I've seen it.

54:47.320 --> 54:48.321
Seen what?

54:51.793 --> 54:52.994
I'm gonna call 911.

54:53.027 --> 54:55.596
Yeah, I know,
it's a good idea.

55:00.902 --> 55:03.738
Oh, shit. My phone just died.

55:03.771 --> 55:05.773
Does anybody
have a phone?

55:05.807 --> 55:07.041
We need to call the cops.

55:07.074 --> 55:08.408
Yeah, I think
mine's in my office.

55:08.441 --> 55:09.844
Do you wanna come
with me to get it?

55:09.877 --> 55:10.812
- Yes.
- Okay.

55:11.411 --> 55:12.513
No!

55:12.547 --> 55:13.748
You guys, I thought we agreed

55:13.781 --> 55:15.716
that we were just
gonna stay here?

55:15.750 --> 55:19.319
Okay, well, do
you have a phone?

55:19.352 --> 55:22.023
Me and modern technology
don't really mix, you know?

55:22.056 --> 55:23.591
Ladies.

55:23.624 --> 55:25.392
Especially Diana.

55:25.425 --> 55:26.994
This is for you.

55:32.300 --> 55:35.203
I was just like
you, 30 years ago.

55:35.236 --> 55:37.638
You're nothing like me.
What're you talking about?

55:37.672 --> 55:40.908
I was just a young
assistant archeologist

55:40.942 --> 55:45.445
with my brother down there
at the tar pits of La Brea.

55:47.582 --> 55:48.883
But then I saw things.

55:50.785 --> 55:53.688
Things that people
don't wanna see.

55:55.122 --> 55:59.627
When it was disturbed under
the ground, it would come up.

56:00.360 --> 56:01.329
And what comes up?

56:05.199 --> 56:07.168
Man of the tar.

56:14.775 --> 56:16.443
This works almost every time.

56:21.716 --> 56:23.416
Oh, my god!

56:23.450 --> 56:25.720
What's the matter with you?

56:25.753 --> 56:30.758
I was going places, boy.
I'm not crazy like you think.

56:38.966 --> 56:41.335
Sometimes things
ain't what they seem.

56:41.369 --> 56:44.538
Down there at the
tar pits of La Brea.

56:45.438 --> 56:47.074
I told them the truth.

56:47.108 --> 56:48.542
I did!

56:48.576 --> 56:52.647
But sometimes people don't
wanna hear the truth.

56:52.680 --> 56:54.982
So they gave me a label.

56:55.016 --> 56:57.450
They called me schizophrenic.

56:59.387 --> 57:01.355
Whoa, whoa.

57:01.389 --> 57:03.824
No, they didn't believe me.

57:06.294 --> 57:09.964
The deaths of all those
people 30 years ago.

57:18.438 --> 57:23.443
Ever since then, I had to be a
man of the street.

57:24.912 --> 57:29.283
A man of this great
office.

57:29.317 --> 57:31.819
Could I just
ask you one thing?

57:31.852 --> 57:33.988
Have you seen my dad?

57:34.021 --> 57:36.624
You're Barry Greenwood's boy?

57:38.192 --> 57:40.795
But you're such a pussy.

57:40.828 --> 57:43.531
So you tap that button
as fast as you can

57:43.564 --> 57:47.134
and as hard as you can and
I'll hold the top button really

57:47.168 --> 57:50.071
really hard while I drag my
knuckles across the screen.

57:50.104 --> 57:51.305
Right, go.

57:51.339 --> 57:52.573
Just breathe.

57:53.473 --> 57:54.909
Breathe.

57:54.942 --> 57:58.646
He just always does
this, it drives me crazy.

58:01.749 --> 58:03.818
What's your name anyway?

58:03.851 --> 58:06.354
After all these years, boy,

58:06.387 --> 58:08.990
you finally wanna know my name?

58:12.193 --> 58:13.527
The name's Carl.

58:15.029 --> 58:16.263
O'Neil.

58:16.297 --> 58:17.131
The third.

58:18.299 --> 58:21.235
But folks round here
just call me Carl.

58:24.271 --> 58:25.106
Carl.

58:27.808 --> 58:30.678
Okay, remember before, I
was talking about my dad?

58:30.711 --> 58:32.947
Have you seen him?

58:32.980 --> 58:35.416
I thought I saw him back
there for a brief little moment.

58:35.449 --> 58:36.817
You did? Okay.

58:36.851 --> 58:39.186
Here's what we have to do.

58:40.988 --> 58:43.224
We gotta work together to
beat the man of the tar

58:43.257 --> 58:46.093
and find Mr. Barry Greenwood.

58:46.127 --> 58:47.294
Okay.

58:47.328 --> 58:49.030
Whatever it takes, I'll buy it.

58:49.063 --> 58:50.231
What do we do?

58:55.536 --> 58:57.471
When noise disturbs the world

58:57.506 --> 59:02.176
where the creature of the
tar rests, he becomes uneasy.

59:02.209 --> 59:04.311
And when man builds down,

59:05.446 --> 59:08.416
he disrupts the
world where he lives.

59:08.449 --> 59:12.319
And his only recourse is
to stop that disruption,

59:12.353 --> 59:14.822
and he used his
world to destroy.

59:14.855 --> 59:17.458
You see, he's
friends with the tar.

59:17.491 --> 59:21.662
Friends with the tar? How
are you friends with tar?

59:21.695 --> 59:26.667
And every time he's disturbed,
his unrest becomes greater.

59:26.700 --> 59:28.369
Okay, let's say I believe you.

59:28.402 --> 59:29.703
Oh, believe.

59:29.737 --> 59:32.840
- So, what do we do?
- It's light.

59:32.873 --> 59:36.444
It's his eyes, young Greenwood,
he can't have the light.

59:36.477 --> 59:39.380
See, his eyes are
his worst enemy.

59:39.413 --> 59:40.981
At least the one he has left.

59:41.015 --> 59:42.450
He only has one eye?

59:42.483 --> 59:44.151
Light and silence.

59:45.019 --> 59:46.555
Light and silence?

59:46.587 --> 59:48.155
That's the answer.

59:48.189 --> 59:49.023
Okay.

59:51.692 --> 59:53.727
So what do we do?

59:53.761 --> 59:58.199
Well, I...

01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:04.472
I'm gonna go find Zach.

01:00:04.506 --> 01:00:05.574
Wait, Rose.

01:00:12.746 --> 01:00:14.982
Silence, young Greenwood.

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:31.065
Zach?

01:00:31.098 --> 01:00:34.335
If you can hear me,
say something back.

01:00:37.805 --> 01:00:41.308
- Zach, where are you?
- Shut the...

01:00:41.342 --> 01:00:42.511
Shh, shh, shh.

01:00:45.547 --> 01:00:46.380
Zach?

01:00:48.182 --> 01:00:50.451
Zach, please say something.

01:00:53.354 --> 01:00:54.155
Zach?

01:00:59.493 --> 01:01:01.795
Zach, you need to answer me.

01:01:05.432 --> 01:01:10.404
Zach, stop being stubborn
for once in your life and...

01:01:11.606 --> 01:01:13.374
The power's gonna
come back on soon.

01:01:13.407 --> 01:01:16.243
That bad premonition
that I have?

01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:18.212
It's gone.

01:01:20.814 --> 01:01:23.317
Certainly somebody's gotta
call the cops, right?

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.687
This is the only time ever
I want the cops to come.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.623
I'm not just saying
this because of the cards,

01:01:28.657 --> 01:01:33.060
I truly think that everything's
gonna be all right.

01:01:40.569 --> 01:01:41.402
Quiet.

01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:47.141
Right, it's gone, it's gone.

01:01:47.174 --> 01:01:48.242
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:49.109
Let's go.

01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:52.279
Shh, shh, shh.

01:01:53.347 --> 01:01:55.617
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:02:12.266 --> 01:02:14.969
Think it's finally toast.

01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:17.805
We are so sorry for your loss.

01:02:17.838 --> 01:02:19.773
Rest in peace, phone.

01:02:19.807 --> 01:02:21.742
You were so good to me.

01:02:26.013 --> 01:02:30.351
You've been so good to
me you make me wanna shout?

01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:34.989
Kick my heels up and shout?

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:40.227
Throw my
hands up and shout.

01:02:40.261 --> 01:02:41.529
No.

01:02:44.566 --> 01:02:46.534
Don't forget to say you will.

01:02:46.568 --> 01:02:48.402
Don't forget to say.

Shh, Rose,
you've gotta be quiet.

01:03:47.995 --> 01:03:52.667
I am really not into being
shushed from you right now.

01:04:04.011 --> 01:04:05.513
I'm sorry, okay?

01:04:07.281 --> 01:04:09.651
It's just that there's...

01:04:09.684 --> 01:04:10.518
What?

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:12.853
Can we talk about this later?

01:04:12.886 --> 01:04:15.255
Why can't you just tell me?

01:04:17.559 --> 01:04:19.493
You're a lot more like
your dad than you think.

01:04:19.527 --> 01:04:20.595
Oh, come on.

01:04:20.628 --> 01:04:22.530
No. God, just stay here.

01:04:22.564 --> 01:04:24.064
What is out there?

01:04:24.098 --> 01:04:28.302
Okay, there's a really,
really bad guy out there.

01:04:28.335 --> 01:04:30.739
Please just stay here,
let me finish this.

01:04:30.772 --> 01:04:32.774
Come on, Rose, trust me.

01:04:34.509 --> 01:04:35.342
Okay?

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:38.946
Okay.

01:05:02.837 --> 01:05:03.738
Stop!

01:05:03.772 --> 01:05:05.774
The hell is your problem?

01:05:27.796 --> 01:05:29.263
I'm sorry.

01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:32.834
God, I just feel like we've
been in here for way too long.

01:05:32.867 --> 01:05:34.334
Completely agreed.

01:05:34.368 --> 01:05:36.470
I should really go
check on Carmenia.

01:05:36.504 --> 01:05:37.938
Yeah, I'll go with
you for protection.

01:05:37.971 --> 01:05:40.073
No, are you guys insane?

01:05:40.107 --> 01:05:42.376
No, neither of you
are going anywhere.

01:05:42.409 --> 01:05:43.545
You just stay here...

01:05:48.115 --> 01:05:50.184
That's really bad energy.

01:05:55.489 --> 01:05:56.323
Get up!

01:06:19.213 --> 01:06:21.148
That is not a subway!

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:23.518
Just remember.

01:06:23.551 --> 01:06:25.820
- Just stay here.
- Just stay here.

01:06:58.653 --> 01:06:59.654
It's gone.

01:07:04.458 --> 01:07:05.660
I think we're alone, you guys.

01:07:05.693 --> 01:07:07.762
Marigold, it's not
the time for this shit.

01:07:07.795 --> 01:07:08.630
Shut up.

01:07:10.297 --> 01:07:13.267
Marigold, seriously.
What are you doing?

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.703
- What're you doing?
- I feel that...

01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:17.639
That was the end of it.

01:07:22.810 --> 01:07:24.812
No, are you out of
your mind? Sit down!

01:07:24.846 --> 01:07:25.914
Voices!

01:07:25.947 --> 01:07:27.447
I think he's right that
we should just sit down

01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:29.017
and wait for help to come.

01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:33.120
I know I said we should
wait, but if it's gone,

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:35.823
we need to make a run for it.

01:07:35.857 --> 01:07:37.057
No, wait.

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:38.593
Stop doing that.

01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.118
Are you nuts?

01:08:05.152 --> 01:08:06.486
Stop doing that!

01:08:09.256 --> 01:08:12.259
Stop it. What're you doing?

01:08:12.292 --> 01:08:13.962
I just gotta look.

01:08:19.934 --> 01:08:22.604
I just know we're gonna be okay.

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:30.109
You guys.

01:08:30.143 --> 01:08:31.645
I think it's gone.

01:08:39.754 --> 01:08:40.854
Oh, my god!

01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:49.564
Oh, shit!

01:08:58.438 --> 01:08:59.473
Come on, work.

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:02.209
Damn it! Work, work, work.

01:09:02.242 --> 01:09:03.077
Come on.

01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:39.680
Zach!

01:09:39.714 --> 01:09:41.649
Oh, my god. It's Zach, Ben!

01:09:41.683 --> 01:09:44.184
Diana, come on, we have to
go. Did you see that thing?

01:09:44.216 --> 01:09:46.154
Diana, where's Marigold?

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:49.122
Everybody's gone.
Marigold, dead.

01:09:50.524 --> 01:09:51.959
Everybody's gone.

01:09:54.662 --> 01:09:55.830
Marigold.

01:09:55.863 --> 01:09:57.565
I can't believe I
just killed that thing.

01:09:57.598 --> 01:09:58.800
Diana, come on.

01:09:58.833 --> 01:10:00.601
No, wait! Wait.

01:10:00.635 --> 01:10:02.136
Didn't I just save your life?

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:05.740
Yes, kind of, okay? But
let's talk about that later.

01:10:05.773 --> 01:10:07.875
No, no, no. Now, now.

01:10:07.909 --> 01:10:09.877
Ben, I don't care what
you did, we just have to-

01:10:09.911 --> 01:10:11.579
- This has nothing
to do with you!

01:10:11.612 --> 01:10:15.683
We had a deal, a saved
life equals a kiss!

01:10:15.717 --> 01:10:16.551
Don't.

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:19.187
We shook on it!

01:10:19.219 --> 01:10:21.956
I'm sick of being walked all
over by you guys all the time!

01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:24.192
I finally did something
meaningful with my life

01:10:24.224 --> 01:10:26.426
and I just wanted to
be acknowledged, okay?

01:10:26.460 --> 01:10:28.428
It doesn't matter who
saved anyone's life.

01:10:28.462 --> 01:10:29.697
We just have to get out of here!

01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:30.932
I'm trying!

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:32.200
Come on!

01:10:32.232 --> 01:10:34.202
This has nothing to
do with you, shut up!

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:36.637
It's dead, what's the
rush? I killed it, okay?

01:10:38.005 --> 01:10:39.107
Ben!

01:10:42.275 --> 01:10:43.578
Ben!

01:10:47.648 --> 01:10:52.352
Ben!

01:10:55.455 --> 01:10:57.257
Come on, Diana, grab my hand!

01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:59.426
Oh, my god.

01:10:59.459 --> 01:11:00.327
Run, Diana!

01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:03.598
- Zach!
- Reach, reach!

01:11:03.631 --> 01:11:05.700
- Reach for my hand.
- Zach, help me.

01:11:05.733 --> 01:11:06.734
Come on. No.

01:11:26.988 --> 01:11:27.989
God damn it!

01:12:01.956 --> 01:12:02.757
Shh, shh.

01:13:14.461 --> 01:13:15.196
Rose!

01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:17.959
- Who is that?
- Barry?

01:14:17.992 --> 01:14:19.492
Oh, Rose.

01:14:19.527 --> 01:14:20.728
Oh, my god!

01:14:20.761 --> 01:14:22.096
Rose, hold me.

01:14:22.129 --> 01:14:23.931
- What happened?
- No, no, no. Look at me.

01:14:23.965 --> 01:14:25.166
Are you okay?

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:27.001
- Yes, are you okay?
- Listen. No, no, no.

01:14:27.034 --> 01:14:28.703
Listen to me, listen to me.

01:14:28.736 --> 01:14:30.104
You've gotta be quiet.

01:14:30.137 --> 01:14:31.772
That's what Zach said too.

01:14:31.806 --> 01:14:33.541
Rose, is Zach okay?

01:14:38.512 --> 01:14:39.347
No.

01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:41.282
Barry, stay awake, okay?

01:14:41.315 --> 01:14:42.817
You gotta stay
awake, you just...

01:14:44.719 --> 01:14:46.120
Oh, god.

01:14:46.153 --> 01:14:47.688
Tell me a story, okay?

01:14:47.722 --> 01:14:48.889
Barry?

01:14:48.923 --> 01:14:50.825
Keep talking, okay?
Tell me a story.

01:14:50.858 --> 01:14:54.328
I thought I was
prepared for this, but...

01:14:54.362 --> 01:14:56.097
Prepared for what?

01:15:08.876 --> 01:15:11.645
Shit, I gotta
go. Where's my dad?

01:15:11.679 --> 01:15:14.348
My dad, that look on his face.

01:15:17.451 --> 01:15:20.788
I'll never forget
that look on his face.

01:15:25.393 --> 01:15:27.461
I was looking for my dad.

01:15:28.329 --> 01:15:29.597
And that sound.

01:15:30.765 --> 01:15:33.034
My god, there was a sound.

01:15:33.067 --> 01:15:34.935
A sound like you've never heard.

01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:43.677
I was scared.

01:15:44.779 --> 01:15:46.113
I ran and I hid.

01:15:47.415 --> 01:15:48.749
I was so afraid.

01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:11.072
Papa!

01:16:13.874 --> 01:16:17.411
Okay, come here.

01:16:26.887 --> 01:16:29.857
Something more dangerous,

01:16:29.890 --> 01:16:32.827
and more terrible than anything.

01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.628
Anything you can
possibly imagine.

01:16:36.263 --> 01:16:37.098
Listen.

01:16:38.199 --> 01:16:41.735
Listen, you hear that?

01:16:41.769 --> 01:16:42.937
Dad?

01:16:42.970 --> 01:16:44.872
Dad, are you down here?

01:16:46.173 --> 01:16:47.007
Rose?

01:16:58.219 --> 01:16:59.653
Dad?

01:16:59.687 --> 01:17:01.622
Dad, are you here?

01:17:13.801 --> 01:17:15.269
What the...

01:17:29.316 --> 01:17:30.484
What the fuck?

01:17:57.077 --> 01:17:59.013
Okay, grab the corner
of that carpet and just-

01:17:59.046 --> 01:18:01.182
- Right here?
- Yeah, just pull it back.

01:18:01.215 --> 01:18:03.017
Pull it up. That a girl.

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:05.686
Okay, lay it down
first. That's it.

01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:07.988
Get behind.

01:18:09.023 --> 01:18:10.991
Get behind but be quiet.

01:18:11.025 --> 01:18:12.326
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

01:18:12.359 --> 01:18:13.562
Shh.

01:18:13.595 --> 01:18:14.529
Don't move.

01:18:15.664 --> 01:18:16.598
Don't move.

01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:25.706
- Zach!
- Rose?

01:18:25.739 --> 01:18:27.241
Rose!

01:18:27.274 --> 01:18:28.108
Dad?

01:18:31.178 --> 01:18:32.547
Dad!

01:18:32.581 --> 01:18:34.014
Calm down.

01:18:34.048 --> 01:18:36.884
Why did you think you could
do this on your own, Dad?

01:18:36.917 --> 01:18:39.053
- Listen to me.
- What?

01:18:39.086 --> 01:18:41.989
This is important,
we gotta work fast.

01:18:42.022 --> 01:18:43.757
I need you to do
something for me.

01:18:43.791 --> 01:18:45.059
This one of your plans?

01:18:45.092 --> 01:18:45.993
Okay, okay.

01:18:49.129 --> 01:18:51.232
I need you to open that box.

01:18:51.265 --> 01:18:52.733
Okay.

01:18:52.766 --> 01:18:56.170
- Come on, quietly, quietly.
- Okay, okay.

01:18:58.806 --> 01:19:03.010
Okay, open it.

01:19:03.043 --> 01:19:04.245
What is this stuff?

01:19:04.278 --> 01:19:07.982
See that handle? Slide
it out of the sheath.

01:19:14.855 --> 01:19:18.392
You know, Zach, sometimes
it takes something like this

01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:20.794
just to realize that all
the battles that we fought

01:19:20.828 --> 01:19:23.163
just weren't worth fighting.

01:19:24.031 --> 01:19:25.299
You're right.

01:19:26.333 --> 01:19:27.334
But this is.

01:19:29.003 --> 01:19:31.872
You're gonna have to do this.

01:19:31.905 --> 01:19:33.240
Can you do this?

01:19:36.243 --> 01:19:37.077
Yeah.

01:19:45.486 --> 01:19:48.822
Hey, Zach.
What is that thing?

01:20:05.607 --> 01:20:06.508
You got it?

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:17.418
Shit.

01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:22.289
You got
it? That a girl.

01:20:22.323 --> 01:20:23.357
Got it, got it?

01:20:23.390 --> 01:20:24.224
Okay.

01:20:29.463 --> 01:20:30.297
Shit!

01:20:34.602 --> 01:20:37.471
Oh, no! The electricity
is not working!

01:20:39.273 --> 01:20:40.874
Get at it.

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:41.743
Got it?

01:20:47.948 --> 01:20:48.783
Sit down.

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:51.285
It's gonna be okay.

01:20:53.220 --> 01:20:56.658
You know
what that smells like?

01:20:56.691 --> 01:20:58.392
Smells like $100,000.

01:21:02.564 --> 01:21:03.364
Hello!

01:21:05.966 --> 01:21:10.938
One hour till everybody's
gotta the hell outta here!

01:21:10.971 --> 01:21:13.040
Actually, 54 minutes!

01:21:13.073 --> 01:21:14.642
54 minutes!

01:21:14.676 --> 01:21:15.442
Shh!

01:21:16.877 --> 01:21:18.580
Don't shush me!

01:21:18.613 --> 01:21:20.347
I can make as much
noise as I want.

01:21:20.381 --> 01:21:21.649
This is my building!

01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:24.885
I can make as much
noise as I want!

01:21:24.918 --> 01:21:26.353
Sebastian!

01:21:26.387 --> 01:21:28.021
Shut the fuck up.

01:21:28.055 --> 01:21:29.657
Will you stop shushing me?

01:21:29.691 --> 01:21:32.627
Don't you understand that there
is a Kentucky Fried Chicken

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:34.194
that is gonna be directly below

01:21:34.228 --> 01:21:36.163
where we're standing very soon?

01:21:36.196 --> 01:21:37.565
That is exciting.

01:21:37.599 --> 01:21:39.667
You've got to be quiet!

01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:42.236
You don't understand.

01:21:42.269 --> 01:21:43.904
I'm so excited right
now, I could dance!

01:21:43.937 --> 01:21:48.710
Shut up, you've got to
be quiet. Shut the fuck up!

01:21:48.743 --> 01:21:49.577
Whoa.

01:21:50.612 --> 01:21:51.945
Hey.

01:21:51.979 --> 01:21:52.881
Relax, man.

01:21:54.047 --> 01:21:56.216
Okay? There's, there's,
don't get crazy, okay?

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.352
You, you, you can have
another 10 minutes.

01:21:58.385 --> 01:21:59.587
You've gotta be quiet.

01:21:59.621 --> 01:22:01.756
You don't understand
what's out there.

01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:03.457
Out where?

01:22:03.490 --> 01:22:04.291
Here.

01:22:09.363 --> 01:22:10.164
Here?

01:22:30.685 --> 01:22:32.252
Oh, shit.

01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:33.086
Go, go.

01:22:36.223 --> 01:22:37.224
It's okay.

01:22:39.928 --> 01:22:41.696
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:41.729 --> 01:22:43.430
He'll go away.

01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:45.199
He's gone, he's gone.

01:22:58.078 --> 01:23:00.214
I've got this.

01:23:00.247 --> 01:23:01.415
I've got this.

01:23:03.350 --> 01:23:05.620
Light and silence.

01:23:06.855 --> 01:23:08.355
That's the answer.

01:23:41.188 --> 01:23:42.489
What the fuck?

01:23:48.830 --> 01:23:49.764
It was you.

01:23:53.233 --> 01:23:54.536
Fucking asshole.

01:24:55.095 --> 01:24:56.096
He's gone.

01:25:00.802 --> 01:25:02.135
I'm so scared.

01:25:15.182 --> 01:25:17.184
Come on, come on.

01:25:18.786 --> 01:25:19.687
Shit.

01:25:21.121 --> 01:25:22.957
No!

01:25:22.991 --> 01:25:26.293
Go back, go back!

01:25:35.103 --> 01:25:36.571
Dad!

01:25:36.604 --> 01:25:37.872
Dad, grab this!

01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:40.942
Below you, grab it!

01:25:40.975 --> 01:25:41.976
I got it!

01:25:42.010 --> 01:25:43.176
What is this thing?

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:45.079
- Turn it on!
- What do I do?

01:25:45.113 --> 01:25:47.347
Push the red button, Dad!

01:25:49.383 --> 01:25:50.885
I've got it!

01:25:52.285 --> 01:25:54.187
Point it in his eyes!

01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:27.648
Don't fuck with my family.

01:27:45.465 --> 01:27:47.068
I don't hear him.

01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:52.974
- Oh, Zach.
- Zach.

01:27:58.746 --> 01:27:59.981
Let's go.

01:28:00.014 --> 01:28:00.848
Let's go.

01:28:04.384 --> 01:28:05.653
Dad.

01:28:05.686 --> 01:28:06.521
Family.

01:28:12.794 --> 01:28:14.195
You did it.

01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:15.029
Dad.

01:28:54.535 --> 01:28:57.038
"Don't fuck with my family."

01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:06.214
You actually said "don't
fuck with my family?"

01:29:08.015 --> 01:29:09.917
Yeah, I actually said that.

01:29:09.951 --> 01:29:11.351
I mean, that's...

01:29:16.324 --> 01:29:20.161
And then you shined
a light on this thing?

01:29:20.194 --> 01:29:22.263
Some sort of super light?

01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.236
I don't know if I'd
call it a super light.

01:29:28.269 --> 01:29:31.772
It was really bright and I was
surprised as you it worked.

01:29:31.806 --> 01:29:33.406
It actually worked.

01:29:39.747 --> 01:29:42.917
And the monster
was eight feet tall?

01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:45.152
Or nine, ten?

01:29:45.186 --> 01:29:46.687
I don't know, it was huge.

01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:47.989
Tall monster.

01:29:49.523 --> 01:29:51.125
Remember I told
you it had the tusk?

01:29:51.158 --> 01:29:52.660
- The tusk?
- The tusks!

01:29:52.693 --> 01:29:53.861
The tusk.

01:29:53.895 --> 01:29:55.897
Right, the tusk.

01:29:57.999 --> 01:29:58.833
Okay?

01:30:00.467 --> 01:30:02.637
Because this is the truth.

01:30:04.437 --> 01:30:07.341
This is what's
going on down there.

01:30:15.049 --> 01:30:17.484
I'm not crazy like you think.

01:30:20.621 --> 01:30:21.722
Whoa.

01:30:21.756 --> 01:30:22.590
Hey.

01:30:23.624 --> 01:30:25.960
We did not use the word crazy.

01:30:25.993 --> 01:30:28.529
Well, the dad needs
medical and then I think

01:30:28.562 --> 01:30:31.132
that we can let him and
the girl in holding go.

01:30:31.165 --> 01:30:32.499
Yep and we
can put out an APB

01:30:32.533 --> 01:30:36.871
for a tall homeless guy
with a thing for tar.

01:31:17.078 --> 01:31:19.313
All right. Let's go, Dad.

01:31:21.315 --> 01:31:23.517
And Dad, I don't
think it's over.

01:31:23.551 --> 01:31:24.785
Yeah.

01:31:25.953 --> 01:31:28.356
We'd have to
do this all on our own.

01:31:28.389 --> 01:31:29.824
Like Papa.

01:31:29.857 --> 01:31:31.092
We have to find the creature

01:31:31.125 --> 01:31:33.427
and we need to go under the pit.

01:31:33.461 --> 01:31:35.229
I'm not sure.

01:31:35.262 --> 01:31:39.233
It's the only
way. Dad, it will be back.

01:31:39.266 --> 01:31:40.634
No.

01:31:40.668 --> 01:31:41.502
They will.

01:31:50.211 --> 01:31:52.513
Story of the man of the tar.

01:31:52.546 --> 01:31:56.117
Some say he still
lives in the tar.

01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:57.752
Under the streets
that were once filled

01:31:57.785 --> 01:32:01.622
with the hustle and
bustle of trollies.

01:32:01.655 --> 01:32:05.626
The man of the tar not
long ago attacked a family.

01:32:09.463 --> 01:32:10.498
So many died.

01:32:12.633 --> 01:32:14.435
I should know.

01:32:14.468 --> 01:32:16.637
My brother was one of them.

01:32:18.272 --> 01:32:22.476
As for the fate of Matchi-Manitou,
the creature of the tar,

01:32:23.077 --> 01:32:24.845
no one knows.

01:32:24.879 --> 01:32:27.948
He may be gone, or
he may be waiting.

01:32:29.383 --> 01:32:31.919
Waiting to be awoken.

01:32:31.952 --> 01:32:33.454
Awoken once again.

01:32:34.989 --> 01:32:37.158
Awoken by the streets
you find yourself

01:32:37.191 --> 01:32:39.693
standing on right here, today.

01:32:42.063 --> 01:32:45.066
The streets of Los Angeles.
