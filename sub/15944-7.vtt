WEBVTT

00:04.300 --> 00:05.733
He was only just adopted.

00:05.767 --> 00:07.833
It might be easier for you
 to get him back

00:07.867 --> 00:09.767
-if you had
 the father's support.
 -It's Claude.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.067
Did you find out their name,
 the couple who have him?

00:14.333 --> 00:17.667
Some scruffy Cinderella 
 playing dress-up 
 in my clothes.

00:17.700 --> 00:21.467
Where is my bag?
 It was hanging on the back
 of this chair!

00:21.500 --> 00:25.233
-Wait! Where's the film?
-Is this what
he's looking for?

00:26.267 --> 00:27.967
Monsieur Rossi,
 what brings you here?

00:28.000 --> 00:31.533
Your boss made
 more than a few trips
 to Berlin and Vienna.

00:31.567 --> 00:33.400
Then publish the story
 and leave him alone.

00:33.433 --> 00:37.600
The papers he bought for us
 kept us from going to a place
 where nobody came back.

00:37.633 --> 00:41.633
A body has been found
on your property, buried
in a shallow grave.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.100
My mother killed that sailor.

00:43.133 --> 00:47.000
You want the world to match
 what's swirling round in
 your head.

00:47.033 --> 00:49.333
Paul, he'll never have 
 what you have.

00:49.367 --> 00:50.533
Scissors!

00:50.567 --> 00:54.200
If I can ever be helpful,
 don't hesitate to ask.

00:54.233 --> 00:57.233
Your brother might be willing
 to live with an arrangement,
 but I am not.

00:57.267 --> 01:00.267
-I want her gone.
 -She's not who you need now.

01:01.133 --> 01:02.567
You need me.

01:02.600 --> 01:04.433
What excuse will you give 
 for your better half?

01:04.467 --> 01:07.067
-Not your wife. Your brother.
 -Cesar Cassatt.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.933
My brother asked him
 to find you a position
 in their company.

01:09.967 --> 01:12.133
Dominique! Stop!

01:19.900 --> 01:22.333
* I love Paris

01:22.367 --> 01:25.067
* In the springtime

01:26.767 --> 01:28.767
* I love Paris

01:28.800 --> 01:32.067
* In the fall

01:33.133 --> 01:35.433
* I love Paris

01:35.467 --> 01:37.700
* In the winter 
 when it drizzles *

01:38.733 --> 01:40.933
* Say, I love Paris

01:40.967 --> 01:43.933
* In the summer 
 when it sizzles *

01:43.967 --> 01:46.533
* I love Paris

01:46.567 --> 01:50.200
* Why, oh, why 
 do I love Paris? *

01:50.233 --> 01:52.533
* Because my love

01:52.567 --> 01:54.400
* Is near

03:01.700 --> 03:03.167
Charlotte.

03:05.833 --> 03:08.067
Why are you here?

03:12.400 --> 03:16.067
-I thought we agreed that it
 would be best if--
 -I have seven fittings today.

03:16.100 --> 03:19.867
Six tomorrow. Nine on
Wednesday. Do you want
to see my book, monsieur?

03:19.900 --> 03:21.467
Please don't make this
 any more difficult--

03:21.500 --> 03:25.833
My job is to comfort
 the clients, not you.

03:25.867 --> 03:29.767
The sales aren't complete
until the outfits are
hanging in their closets.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.467
What do you want, Charlotte?

03:34.633 --> 03:36.367
What I've earned.

03:45.367 --> 03:48.067
HELEN: Poor Dominique.
 Her body will recover.

03:48.067 --> 03:51.933
But apparently there is
a wound that goes
from her ear to her chin.

03:51.967 --> 03:54.433
The right side of her face
 is...

03:55.700 --> 03:57.700
Shit.

03:59.433 --> 04:01.267
Well...

04:01.300 --> 04:03.467
Maybe Paul
 should pass these on.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.667
You left the château early.

04:10.700 --> 04:14.067
And Paul said you were
 driven home by Cesar Cassatt.

04:15.833 --> 04:18.067
Stop fishing, Helen.

04:19.700 --> 04:23.833
Yeah, the playboy likes
 to play with boys
 more than girls.

04:23.867 --> 04:25.533
Big fucking surprise.

04:28.333 --> 04:33.833
Doesn't stop the bastard from
 marrying some poor clueless
 creature this summer.

04:33.867 --> 04:36.633
Considering who
 his family is, he probably
 doesn't have a choice.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.400
We all have a choice.

04:44.367 --> 04:48.867
You might want to send
 Monsieur Trouvier's daughter
 a note.

04:48.900 --> 04:50.900
Cecile was crushed
 that you left.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.933
I'm not good at notes.

04:52.967 --> 04:54.800
She'll figure it out
 on her own.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.267
-Claude?
-Mm.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.333
I think you're wrong.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.600
I'm not telling you to be
two different people,

05:02.633 --> 05:07.800
but try to let strangers
like you before deciding
that they shouldn't.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.367
You might be surprised.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.733
There's no reason
 that you can't be you.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.233
Are you sure about that?

05:30.367 --> 05:34.400
I guess she must have had
 one of her friends grab my
 camera at the bar.

05:34.433 --> 05:38.067
Maybe she wanted that film
 to hold Monsieur to ransom.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.967
I'm just guessing.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.667
One thing that's pretty clear
 is she wanted to be the one
 wearing that wedding gown.

05:48.700 --> 05:50.700
I should go see her.

05:50.733 --> 05:53.400
Wait. You're not...?

05:53.433 --> 05:56.267
I don't think she wants
 to see you right now.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.800
What would you do, if you
 couldn't do this any more?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.567
What?

06:09.433 --> 06:11.233
Take pictures.

06:12.933 --> 06:15.133
What if it wasn't just
 your camera?

06:16.067 --> 06:18.967
What if you lost your eyes?

06:19.067 --> 06:23.100
Hey, it is too early
 in the day
 to start thinking like that.

06:23.133 --> 06:24.800
Right?
 Dominique's gonna be fine.

06:24.833 --> 06:26.533
You don't know that.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.800
She may not have
 a family to turn to.

06:32.833 --> 06:35.500
Don't be fooled by pictures.

06:35.533 --> 06:37.533
That dog,
 it belonged to my neighbour.

06:37.567 --> 06:40.067
So did the car.

06:40.067 --> 06:42.200
It was my father's idea.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.333
Everything was borrowed.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.433
Even my mother's smile
 came from a previous life.

06:51.733 --> 06:53.733
One before children.

06:59.433 --> 07:03.067
PAUL: Helen's already spoken
 with her uncle.

07:03.067 --> 07:05.267
There are top-notch surgeons
 on his staff.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.900
I should have listened
 to your mother's cards.

07:08.933 --> 07:11.567
I think you're in better
hands with Uncle Edgar.

07:11.600 --> 07:15.533
My mother's medical expertise
 begins and ends with leeches.

07:18.867 --> 07:21.667
Is that the magazine spread?

07:21.700 --> 07:23.700
May I see it?

07:31.233 --> 07:33.400
You're on the cover.

07:42.933 --> 07:45.100
I knew I'd hate this angle.

07:46.467 --> 07:49.067
We look like hungry horses.

07:58.333 --> 08:01.067
He was with her when
she stepped off the kerb.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.067
-Juliette...
 -Pardon, monsieur.

08:06.067 --> 08:09.600
Were you able to pick up
more of this?

08:09.633 --> 08:12.600
I didn't, I'm sorry.
 I forgot. I'll get it later.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.433
-Is it true?
 -What?

08:16.267 --> 08:18.267
About Dominique's face?

08:20.367 --> 08:22.367
Er...

08:23.400 --> 08:25.233
I think so.

08:31.067 --> 08:33.400
What's this?

08:35.433 --> 08:37.133
Why is this here?

08:37.167 --> 08:39.200
Charlotte gave it to
 Marianne.

08:39.232 --> 08:42.167
-She said Monsieur wanted it
 made for a specific client.
 -What client?

08:44.700 --> 08:46.367
When did he ask this?

08:51.567 --> 08:53.600
(CLEARS THROAT)

09:03.267 --> 09:06.833
If I had to give up
 the camera, I think I could
 happily drive a cab.

09:06.867 --> 09:10.800
-Without eyes?
 -Ah, you see.
 I forgot that part.

09:10.833 --> 09:12.633
(GASPS)

09:13.667 --> 09:15.733
What's wrong?

09:15.767 --> 09:19.967
Oh, nothing. Er... Hello.

09:20.067 --> 09:24.167
Why don't you go ahead
 and erm, I'll meet you
 at the café?

09:34.067 --> 09:36.200
-What are you doing here?
-Please don't be angry.

09:36.233 --> 09:40.067
-I waited on the corner
 so I could catch you--
 -I waited for you all night.

09:40.100 --> 09:43.367
I got caught
 stealing the records.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.133
I-I-I'm sorry. I...

09:48.167 --> 09:51.167
-I never meant for you to--
 -It's fine.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.267
I've spent my whole life
behind those walls.

09:54.300 --> 09:56.467
Must have been looking
 for a way out, anyway.

09:59.200 --> 10:02.333
Does the Mother Abbess
 know that I was behind this?

10:02.367 --> 10:04.433
Probably.

10:04.467 --> 10:07.200
But what she doesn't know is
 that I remembered what I saw.

10:08.733 --> 10:11.100
Your baby is in Paris, Nina.

10:11.133 --> 10:15.467
The couple who adopted him,
 they live in
 the 8th Arrondissement.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.800
Have you spoken to the father
 since we met?

10:37.667 --> 10:40.833
Glad you got here first.

10:40.867 --> 10:45.433
I just spoke to Marjorie.
 We're about to receive a very
 prestigious commission.

10:45.467 --> 10:47.300
What's her name?

10:47.333 --> 10:50.467
-Don Juan. 
 - How broad are
 her shoulders?

10:50.500 --> 10:53.367
You have been asked to design
 the costumes for
 the next ballet

10:53.400 --> 10:55.567
at the Paris Opera,
 Monsieur Sabine.

10:58.467 --> 11:01.800
You might wanna work on
 your reaction for when
 Marjorie brings it up.

11:01.833 --> 11:04.733
Maybe learn how to smile
when you sigh.

11:04.767 --> 11:08.900
Helen, I'm not sure that
 now is the right time for me
 to take on a job like that.

11:08.933 --> 11:11.867
Maybe not for you,
 but think about Claude.

11:11.900 --> 11:15.300
It might be a nice way to
 smooth some ruffled feathers.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.900
If he's inspired
and busy with designing,

11:17.933 --> 11:20.200
then you can cater
 to clients.

11:21.067 --> 11:22.733
Charlotte hasn't left yet.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.600
She will be gone. It just
can't happen overnight.

11:31.633 --> 11:34.633
Clients rely on her.

11:34.667 --> 11:38.833
Forgive my delay and my suit,
 but not necessarily in
 that order.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.700
Uncle Edgar.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.967
Are you alone?
 Where's Josephine?

11:44.067 --> 11:47.500
Your aunt sends her regrets,
 trapped in meetings at
 the hospital,

11:47.533 --> 11:50.367
but you'll see her tonight
 at the concert.

11:50.400 --> 11:52.800
All this glorious press
 you're getting, young man.

11:52.833 --> 11:57.933
-I don't know if I should
 shake your hand or curtsey.
 -You needn't do either.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.967
-All right.
 -Well, if I'd known that
 Tante Jo couldn't join us,

12:01.067 --> 12:03.733
we could've waited
to have this conversation
this evening.

12:03.767 --> 12:07.367
-Good news shouldn't wait.
 -So you found a doctor
 for Dominique?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.300
The best.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.067
HELEN: Would she have to go 
 there for the surgery?

12:43.100 --> 12:47.600
That's where his team is.
 I've read that the Geneva
 Clinic is state of the art.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.233
He's very much in demand.

12:49.267 --> 12:51.267
But he is willing
to take Dominique's case?

12:51.300 --> 12:52.867
I spoke to him this morning

12:52.900 --> 12:56.200
and he's able to come
 to Paris on Friday
 for a consultation.

12:56.233 --> 13:00.100
-That's terrific.
-Wonderful. We are
so grateful, Uncle Edgar,

13:00.133 --> 13:01.900
and to Tante Jo, of course.

13:01.933 --> 13:05.667
You know, you may not wish
 to raise the subject tonight.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.367
No need to thank your aunt.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.667
Why is that?

13:11.700 --> 13:16.733
Well, we weren't in complete
 agreement about this choice.

13:16.767 --> 13:23.433
-What were her reservations?
 -Some dusty rumours about
 this Swiss doctor.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.400
Who he may have operated
on during the war.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.800
High-ranking
German officers and such.

13:32.667 --> 13:35.067
-They're just rumours.
 -Well, precisely.

13:35.067 --> 13:36.733
You know your aunt.

13:36.767 --> 13:40.533
She still can't forgive
 Mozart for
 being born in Austria.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.600
(WRITING)

13:52.567 --> 13:54.633
Just there. Can you see?

13:54.667 --> 13:56.500
See how it pulls when I walk?

13:56.533 --> 13:58.900
Or is that just
 the way I walk?

13:58.933 --> 14:00.567
Don't answer that.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.800
Maybe we can add to the panel
 in the back.

14:02.833 --> 14:04.267
Over my dead body.

14:04.300 --> 14:06.233
I've got enough bustle
 as it is.

14:06.267 --> 14:08.933
Perhaps you could wear two
 girdles and hold your breath.

14:08.967 --> 14:10.967
I did that at
my first wedding.

14:11.067 --> 14:13.133
Didn't have enough wind
 to say, "I do."

14:13.167 --> 14:15.333
I just nodded
 and collapsed on the cellist.

14:15.367 --> 14:18.200
Lucky for you
it wasn't a tuba.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.767
I was going to show
the Marquise de Lithière
that dress,

14:20.800 --> 14:26.767
but maybe this one is more
 her style, don't you agree?

14:26.800 --> 14:28.200
I'm sorry,
who are we talking about?

14:28.233 --> 14:31.700
The Marquise de Lithière.
You know her, don't you?

14:31.733 --> 14:35.467
We became fast friends at
 Monsieur Trouvier's château
 this weekend.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.100
Her sister is married to
the Baron Roche-Ferois.

14:39.133 --> 14:42.733
No, I never heard of him,
or her for that matter

14:42.767 --> 14:45.067
but, then,
 I am lousy with titles.

14:45.067 --> 14:48.300
We fought a war a long time
 ago so we wouldn't
 have to use them.

14:48.333 --> 14:51.500
And if I'm not mistaken,
we financed that war.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.133
Charlotte,
 you must be feeling better.

14:59.167 --> 15:02.067
Have you recovered
 from the weekend?

15:02.067 --> 15:04.100
Much better,
 thank you, madame.

15:05.367 --> 15:08.600
Maybe I should give the
 Marquise a few more choices.

15:08.633 --> 15:13.267
She's eager to come here
after our tea
and fill her closet.

15:13.300 --> 15:17.133
Is this today? Does the
 Marquise have an appointment?

15:17.167 --> 15:19.433
-Well, I--
-She doesn't need
an appointment.

15:19.467 --> 15:21.467
She has me.

15:59.233 --> 16:03.067
-Is that her,
 the woman who has him?
 -I don't know.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.700
(RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND)

16:18.733 --> 16:20.733
Do you have a moment?

16:23.833 --> 16:26.067
I bought this for Dominique.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.367
A bed jacket.

16:29.400 --> 16:33.267
I was hoping that maybe
you could find something
around here to add,

16:33.300 --> 16:35.300
to make it more special.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.633
Change out the buttons or...?

16:38.667 --> 16:41.067
Y-You know better than me.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.733
I'll do my best.

16:42.767 --> 16:44.767
Leave it there.

16:51.933 --> 16:55.567
Well, if he's not there, I'll
 leave a message. Billy Novak
 wants to see him tonight.

16:56.733 --> 16:59.367
Billy N-O-V-A-K.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.133
Ten o'clock, Café Besan.

17:06.599 --> 17:10.532
Tell him I have
 something significant
 to add to his story.

17:10.567 --> 17:13.233
If we increase
 the volume down here,

17:13.267 --> 17:17.067
we could at least create
the illusion of a waist.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.433
Whose illusion?
 Is it yours or hers?

17:19.467 --> 17:22.433
Cos she's not fooling anyone.
 She's shaped like
 a rolling pin.

17:22.467 --> 17:26.967
I know, but Madame de Seis
 wants this dress.

17:27.067 --> 17:30.700
-So what can we do?
 -Nothing.

17:30.733 --> 17:32.567
This dress wants a waist,
which she doesn't have,

17:32.600 --> 17:36.633
so just get Charlotte to talk
 her into something else.

17:37.833 --> 17:40.067
I'd rather find
another solution.

17:40.933 --> 17:42.500
Oh, I'm sure you will.

17:42.533 --> 17:45.067
You don't give a rat's ass
 what I think, anyway.

17:45.067 --> 17:47.900
-That's not true.
-Really?

17:47.933 --> 17:51.467
Then why would you ask
 Juliette to execute
 a shit design

17:51.500 --> 17:54.333
-that we agreed not to show?
 -What are you talking about?

17:54.367 --> 17:58.100
You went into my drawer.
You took the sketch
without asking me.

17:59.733 --> 18:02.467
The navy feuille.
 The ace of spades neckline.

18:02.500 --> 18:04.733
Charlotte gave it to
 the girls at your request.

18:04.767 --> 18:07.833
-You know the dress.
 -I know the dress, yes,
 but I never requested--

18:07.867 --> 18:09.733
Oh, give it up, Paul.

18:11.933 --> 18:15.633
Well, you may be able to fool
 Madame fucking de Seis...

18:15.667 --> 18:17.800
...but you're gonna have to
 work a lot harder with me.

18:27.533 --> 18:29.967
JULIETTE: I'll meet you
 downstairs for the fitting.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.167
Jeanette needs my help
 with a sleeve.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.167
Did you take this
from my brother's office?

18:52.900 --> 18:55.733
What did you hope to prove
 by giving this to Juliette?

18:55.767 --> 18:59.500
Is this your first attempt to
 humiliate me, or have there
 been others before this?

19:04.300 --> 19:05.967
(SIGHS) Charlotte.

19:06.067 --> 19:09.300
-I don't want this
 to end badly.
 -It already has.

19:09.333 --> 19:12.367
-It doesn't have to.
If you let me make you--
-What?

19:12.400 --> 19:16.233
Send me to a perfume factory
 in another town?

19:16.267 --> 19:19.067
I'm not a chess piece to be
 moved around at your will.

19:20.800 --> 19:24.300
-I didn't realise Monsieur
 Cassatt had already--
 -He hasn't.

19:24.333 --> 19:28.633
But Claude was thoughtful
enough to let me know
your intentions.

19:32.633 --> 19:34.367
(SIGHS)

19:36.767 --> 19:40.067
That was rash of me.
 I didn't think it through.

19:55.067 --> 19:58.167
You're a big part of
 our success, Charlotte.

19:58.200 --> 20:03.667
And you're right. You deserve
 everything you've earned.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.633
I'd like to offer you
 a financial stake
 in the business.

20:07.667 --> 20:11.133
A fair percentage
 that will allow you
 to leave here with dignity

20:11.167 --> 20:13.333
and a certain amount
 of freedom.

20:18.167 --> 20:20.667
I don't think you can ask
for more than that.

20:24.833 --> 20:28.467
I'm not asking for anything,
 I have my own plan.

20:39.833 --> 20:42.567
Hey, Nina.
 Hey, what happened?

20:42.600 --> 20:45.500
-Lunch, you never made it
to the café.
-Sorry.

20:45.533 --> 20:49.200
My friend, she needed my help
 for something important.

20:49.233 --> 20:51.600
Someone around here might
 need your help too, right?

21:00.467 --> 21:03.633
-What are you talking about?
 -Listen.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.700
You told me something last
 weekend about Monsieur Sabine

21:05.733 --> 21:08.067
and now I need you
 to tell someone else.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.067
Rossi is gonna print
 a hatchet job on him.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.100
It could cause
a lot of damage.

21:12.133 --> 21:14.567
Have you told him
 about this article?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.167
I can't.

21:16.200 --> 21:19.333
OK, I'm thinking Rossi may
 have rushed it to print
 because of me.

21:19.367 --> 21:21.933
I challenged him...
 Listen, it doesn't matter.

21:21.967 --> 21:25.467
The fact is his story is
one-sided and it's ugly

21:25.500 --> 21:27.833
and you told me that
this man once saved you.

21:27.867 --> 21:31.767
Right? Well, this could be
 your chance to return
 the favour.

21:31.800 --> 21:35.500
-How?
 -Talk to Rossi.

21:35.533 --> 21:38.133
You let him know
that Paul Sabine
may have made those trips

21:38.167 --> 21:40.633
to Berlin and to Vienna
 in exchange for saving lives.

21:40.667 --> 21:44.100
-Once he hears your story--
 -Why would he care about
 my story?

21:44.133 --> 21:46.600
Nina, you're on
the cover of a magazine.

21:46.633 --> 21:48.967
-You're becoming
 the face of--
 -I can't do this right now.

He doesn't have a future if
 people won't forget his past.
 Nina, I don't know...

21:54.467 --> 21:57.233
-Is Juliette ready for me?
 -Yes, she is.

22:02.533 --> 22:04.367
-Is everything all right?
-Yes, yes.

22:04.400 --> 22:08.967
Erm...Billy had an idea
 for some pictures.

22:09.067 --> 22:10.933
Where's your camera?

22:10.967 --> 22:14.167
He wanted to photograph me
 in the Metro and erm...

22:15.600 --> 22:17.767
...I told him
 it's too dirty down there.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.533
OK.

May I speak with you?

22:52.800 --> 22:54.567
What's this about?

22:56.767 --> 23:00.700
An opportunity
 for both of us.

23:00.733 --> 23:05.667
I found a wealthy banker
who is looking to revive
an old label.

23:05.700 --> 23:07.700
It's practically dead.

23:07.733 --> 23:09.567
They want fresh blood.

23:09.600 --> 23:13.767
A new vision, someone
who's well-connected
to bring it back to life.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.867
They've asked me
 to be that person.

23:16.900 --> 23:22.133
Why? Why would anyone
 want to put new wine
 into old bottles?

23:22.167 --> 23:25.500
Because those bottles carry
 meaningful provenance.

23:26.367 --> 23:30.200
It's an established name,
Claude.

23:30.233 --> 23:33.767
But also a chance for
a new designer to emerge.

23:37.167 --> 23:40.067
Someone like you.

23:40.067 --> 23:42.333
That will never happen
 if you stay here.

23:46.367 --> 23:49.433
So it was you who pinched
 the sketch from my drawer.

23:51.500 --> 23:54.333
How long are you willing
to live in his shadow...

23:55.867 --> 23:58.067
...let him take credit
 for your designs,

23:58.867 --> 24:00.900

24:00.933 --> 24:03.100
You must want something more.

24:03.967 --> 24:05.500
I know I do.

24:05.533 --> 24:09.067
What's going on
 between you and my brother?

24:09.067 --> 24:12.933
The weekend is behind me.
I'm looking forward.

24:12.967 --> 24:16.700
I've spent too many years
dependent on other people
to ensure my future.

 to convince you that

but she's wrong.

I've reinvented myself once
 and I can do it again.

24:42.900 --> 24:46.867
You should be very careful
 about going through other
 people's drawers, Charlotte,

24:46.900 --> 24:49.067
cos you never know
 what you might find.

 too deep.

-Afraid not.

26:11.500 --> 26:13.200
There are seven orders
 to complete by Friday

26:13.233 --> 26:15.300
and you ask me
 to drop everything, for what?

26:15.333 --> 26:18.067
For you to give a gift
 to her?

26:18.100 --> 26:20.400
-I just thought
 you wouldn't mind and--
 -Did you?

26:20.433 --> 26:21.767
Did you think?

26:21.800 --> 26:25.267
There are ten girls
who work in this building
who could do it.

26:25.300 --> 26:26.900
Why did you come to me?

26:26.933 --> 26:31.067
-B-Because you've offered
to help me in the past.
-Is that how you see me?

26:31.067 --> 26:35.200
Someone who's here
 to tie a pretty bow on
 your gift to another girl?

26:35.233 --> 26:36.733
But it's not a Valentine.

 that trip.

 some caution before we enlist

 the maison's reputation.

34:26.933 --> 34:29.266
and occasionally
share my bed.

34:30.533 --> 34:33.533
I think you met my aunt at
 Monsieur Trouvier's château.

34:33.567 --> 34:36.500
The Contessa de Luciano.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.900
So you're how
 he wrangled that invitation?

34:38.933 --> 34:41.667
-Shall we sit?
 -Mm.

34:45.900 --> 34:48.632
-So why did he leave Paris
 this time?
 -He went to Berlin,

34:48.667 --> 34:51.699
to convince a source to let
 him use his name for a story.

34:52.900 --> 34:54.800
Same story he delivered
 to me?

34:54.833 --> 34:59.700
-Did you read it?
 -I did, but I didn't have to.

34:59.733 --> 35:02.067
So how long have you known
 Monsieur Rossi?

35:02.100 --> 35:04.167
For five years.

35:05.367 --> 35:08.067
So you met during the war,
 in Paris?

35:08.067 --> 35:10.733
You look surprised.

35:10.767 --> 35:13.567
He's been stirring this pot
 for a long time.

35:13.600 --> 35:15.467
There aren't too many
 Americans nowadays

35:15.500 --> 35:17.100
hungry to write stories
 about collaborators.

35:17.133 --> 35:18.633
Justice doesn't have
 a nationality.

35:18.667 --> 35:21.333
The man you were going
 after designs pretty dresses.

35:21.367 --> 35:23.367
Seems like
 a strange target to me.

35:23.400 --> 35:26.200
I thought you came here
 with something significant.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.733
I did.

35:27.767 --> 35:30.767
I don't think any story
 should be written until
 you have all the facts.

35:32.067 --> 35:33.767
I'll stop talking when
 my friend arrives.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.400
Your friend?

35:35.433 --> 35:39.067
Look, I don't know
 Paul Sabine that well.

35:39.100 --> 35:42.533
But I do know this:
 people are complicated.

35:42.567 --> 35:45.067
They're capable of doing
 something cowardly at 9:00am,

35:45.100 --> 35:46.933
then something heroic
 an hour later.

35:46.967 --> 35:49.867
Newspapers are
black and white,

35:49.900 --> 35:53.567
but people come in all shades
 of grey, don't they?

35:53.600 --> 35:56.567
Who is this person
you've asked to join us?

35:59.167 --> 36:01.333
She's the new face
 for Paul Sabine.

36:02.500 --> 36:04.333
And you should hear
 what she has to say

36:04.367 --> 36:06.367
before you try him in
 a court of public opinion.

36:06.400 --> 36:08.400
You may end up
looking foolish.

36:08.433 --> 36:11.733
What has your boss offered
 you to make you so loyal?

36:28.933 --> 36:30.800
Sorry I'm late.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.067
May I join you?

36:36.833 --> 36:38.333
Yeah, of course.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.967
This is Marianne Perrault...

36:41.067 --> 36:44.267
the premier d'atelier.

36:44.300 --> 36:48.333
She's worked closely with
 Monsieur Sabine for... What?
 ...seven years now.

36:48.367 --> 36:49.533
Ten.

36:52.300 --> 36:54.367
Longer than
 anyone else there.

37:00.900 --> 37:03.100
Holy fuck! You scared me.

37:04.733 --> 37:08.100
-How is she?
-She fell asleep five
minutes after I got here.

37:08.133 --> 37:10.167
It felt like my third
honeymoon all over again.

37:10.200 --> 37:12.733
I'm sure she was
just honoured
to have you here at all.

37:12.767 --> 37:17.833
No, honey. Nobody should be
 in these places alone.

37:17.867 --> 37:21.067

 Charlotte never left my side.

37:23.600 --> 37:28.333
Well, I'm betting this one
 is out for the night.

37:28.367 --> 37:30.667
I saw a cute little spot
just around the corner

37:30.700 --> 37:33.433
that might stock a vodka
 that won't strip off paint.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.267
What do you say?

37:36.300 --> 37:38.300
Er...no. No. I'm...

37:38.333 --> 37:41.300
I don't think so.
 I'm going to stay here
 tonight, I think.

37:43.067 --> 37:45.367
-She might wake up.
 -Who knew?

37:45.400 --> 37:48.633
The little brother's
 a prince too.

37:48.667 --> 37:51.167
Tell her I was here and...
 I don't know,

37:51.200 --> 37:55.133

a jealous nun and
I shall stop by tomorrow.

 took that away from me.

52:55.467 --> 52:58.067
I need to be alone right now.

52:58.100 --> 53:00.500
You need him!

53:02.400 --> 53:05.067
If you can't give
these clients
something extraordinary,

53:05.067 --> 53:08.067
the invitations
 will disappear.

53:08.067 --> 53:09.900
They'll stop showing up.

53:09.933 --> 53:15.400
You'll be stranded because,
 at the end of the day,
 you're a dressmaker.

53:16.267 --> 53:18.533
You furnish supplies.

53:23.933 --> 53:26.100
I know.

53:36.867 --> 53:38.733
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

53:49.933 --> 53:52.567
-This is Paul Sabine. 
 -Good afternoon, Monsieur.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.767
This is Inspector Bompard. 
 How are you?

53:55.800 --> 53:57.633
Very well, thank you,
 Inspector.

53:57.667 --> 54:00.967
-What can I do for you?
 -Well, I know 
 you're a busy man.

54:01.067 --> 54:04.500
But I wonder if
 you could spare me
 a few minutes tomorrow.

54:04.533 --> 54:07.167
-Tomorrow? 
 -Yes, I'll be in Paris.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.767
And I'd prefer 
 to do this in person.

54:09.800 --> 54:11.367
What's this regarding?

54:11.400 --> 54:14.367
It'll be easier to explain 
 once I'm there, monsieur.

54:14.400 --> 54:17.300
I promise not to take up too
 much of your precious time.

54:17.333 --> 54:20.233
May I look in my book
 and ring you back, Inspector?

54:20.267 --> 54:24.167
Of course. 
 I'll stand by for your call.

54:35.933 --> 54:38.300
What did he want?

54:43.667 --> 54:45.167
Paul?

54:48.633 --> 54:50.233
Paul?
