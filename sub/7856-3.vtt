00:17.028 --> 00:18.064
It wasn't me.

00:20.092 --> 00:23.004
They know who did it.

00:26.032 --> 00:27.064
So who was it, then?

01:23.398 --> 01:26.764
Synced and corrected by VitoSilans
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:28.032 --> 01:32.942
25 years of matrimony.
A most commendable milestone.

01:33.092 --> 01:38.060
I agree, Father. Even if one does
get less for manslaughter!

01:38.210 --> 01:40.566
I thought these two were broke.
They are.

01:40.716 --> 01:43.072
So how come they can afford
all this?

01:43.222 --> 01:45.564
They had a little helping hand.

01:45.714 --> 01:47.906
You mean... you paid for it?

01:48.056 --> 01:50.060
I decided they needed cheering up.

02:07.028 --> 02:11.064
Daphne. Absolutely
parched. Thank you very much indeed.

02:16.056 --> 02:21.004
We can't tell you how grateful we
are. Can we, Henry? No.

02:21.154 --> 02:23.020
I always like to take
care of my tenants.

02:23.170 --> 02:25.530
Besides, any excuse for a party.

02:25.680 --> 02:27.890
You will get your rent, I promise.

02:28.040 --> 02:30.064
You just keep growing your beautiful
flowers, Edie.

02:30.214 --> 02:32.052
Things are bound to turn around.

02:42.048 --> 02:43.914
What a pretty rose.

02:44.064 --> 02:46.024
Not half as pretty as mine.

02:49.096 --> 02:53.076
She still hasn't forgiven you, then,
for last year's flower show?

02:53.226 --> 02:54.882
No.

02:55.032 --> 02:58.072
My choosing Edie's flower
arrangement over Mrs McCarthy's

02:58.222 --> 03:02.032
marked a particular
low point in our relationship.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.004
She'll be gunning for you this year.

03:06.056 --> 03:07.926
Oh, dear.

03:08.076 --> 03:10.088
That's come around quickly.

03:14.004 --> 03:15.922
Here's to you,
you miserable so-and-so.

03:16.072 --> 03:18.072
I spend my days with YOU,
what do you expect?

03:18.222 --> 03:20.910
Ha! Lovely do.

03:21.060 --> 03:23.493
Yeah, Edie deserves it...

03:23.643 --> 03:25.778
for putting up with me.

03:25.928 --> 03:27.914
You're right there.

03:28.064 --> 03:31.000
That glass is looking a bit empty.

03:34.020 --> 03:35.080
Henry, how are you doing?

03:37.056 --> 03:38.874
Yeah, I'm all right.

03:39.024 --> 03:41.036
You're very much missed at St Mary's.

03:42.060 --> 03:44.044
Yeah, well...

03:45.084 --> 03:49.020
If you do want to talk,
the door's always open.

03:51.084 --> 03:52.973
Excuse me.

03:53.123 --> 03:55.012
Mr Lee?

03:57.028 --> 03:59.918
I'm sorry to interrupt this
happy occasion,

04:00.068 --> 04:03.044
but I have been wanting to
speak to you for such a long time.

04:03.194 --> 04:04.874
I'm sorry, do I know you?

04:05.024 --> 04:09.088
No, but I'm hoping that you will
remember my son, Thomas.

04:09.238 --> 04:11.080
You hanged him, you see.

04:15.020 --> 04:19.048
Lady, I hanged 120 men and women,
I don't remember every one.

04:20.079 --> 04:23.513
This is Thomas
and this is his sweetheart, Vera.

04:23.663 --> 04:27.096
They said he murdered her
but he never did, you see?

04:30.068 --> 04:32.854
You do remember him, don't you?

04:33.004 --> 04:36.084
Mr Lee, I have found out that Vera's
killer worked at

04:36.234 --> 04:39.052
the same Crown Court where
she was a secretary.

04:40.092 --> 04:45.020
He was someone important, you see,
and that's why they covered it up.

04:45.170 --> 04:49.044
That's why I had to find you -
I need to clear Thomas's name.

04:49.194 --> 04:53.024
Did he say anything to you?
Did he say anything at all?

04:53.174 --> 04:57.004
He said what all the others said -
nothing. Please, Mr Lee.

04:58.004 --> 05:02.004
Did he mention a man called Max?
He's the one who killed Vera.

05:02.154 --> 05:03.072
Max?

05:06.056 --> 05:08.032
Where did you hear all this?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.866
In prison.

05:12.016 --> 05:14.044
I need you to tell me what he said.

05:16.088 --> 05:17.914
I want you to leave now.

05:18.064 --> 05:21.020
Please, Mr Lee! I'm his mother!
Get out!

05:23.016 --> 05:24.080
You coward!

05:49.008 --> 05:51.451
Mrs McCarthy, what a lovely hat.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.044
It makes you look like royalty.

05:54.194 --> 05:54.930
If only!

05:55.080 --> 05:56.906
Mrs McCarthy...

05:57.056 --> 06:00.016
have you heard of a new
restaurant in Cheltenham called

06:00.166 --> 06:00.938
Gerard's Brasserie?

06:01.088 --> 06:06.080
I was wondering if you'd care to
join me there tomorrow lunchtime.

06:06.230 --> 06:08.902
Well, I have a WI meeting.

06:09.052 --> 06:11.906
The speaker runs
a cattery in Painswick.

06:12.056 --> 06:15.088
Well, surely the WI can do without
you for one day.

06:15.238 --> 06:18.890
No, I don't think I will.

06:19.040 --> 06:22.000
But thank you for the invitation
all the same.

06:22.150 --> 06:24.068
Ladies and Gentlemen.

06:26.020 --> 06:29.080
Henry and I would like to thank you
all very much for coming,

06:29.230 --> 06:33.076
and Lady Felicia, of course,
for all your kindness.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.854
25 years sounds a lot.

06:37.004 --> 06:40.882
Some of you will know it's not
been our easiest year

06:41.032 --> 06:45.874
but we've stuck though it, together,
like we always have.

06:46.024 --> 06:51.052
And, well, I think that's the secret
of a happy marriage, really.

06:52.084 --> 06:55.064
So thank you,
and enjoy your evening.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.024
What about Edie?

07:10.024 --> 07:11.072
Red Lion, anyone?

07:19.024 --> 07:22.040
Ready to sweep all before you
tomorrow, Mrs M?

07:22.190 --> 07:25.052
Tomorrow? Oh, you mean
the flower show.

07:25.202 --> 07:27.080
That's just a bit of fun, isn't it?

07:27.230 --> 07:29.890
Now, what can I do for you?

07:30.040 --> 07:32.475
About George...
You can save your breath.

07:32.625 --> 07:35.060
You clearly put him
up to that little stunt.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.882
Mrs M, you've got it all wrong.

07:37.032 --> 07:40.048
He did come and see me but only
because he was feeling nervous.

07:40.198 --> 07:44.042
He'd wanted to ask you
out for lunch for a very long time.

07:44.192 --> 07:48.036
He seems a jolly decent chap,
and I think he really likes you.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.854
Was there anything else? No.

07:52.004 --> 07:55.036
Only that Gerard's Brasserie is
quite the place to be at the moment

07:55.186 --> 07:57.092
and the Dover sole
is really rather good.

07:57.242 --> 08:00.004
Your Cosmos looks lovely, by the way.

08:24.092 --> 08:25.886
Edie.

08:26.036 --> 08:27.477
Tea's up!

08:27.627 --> 08:28.918
George.

08:29.068 --> 08:31.000
Mrs McCarthy, good morning.

08:31.150 --> 08:31.926
May I have a word?

08:32.076 --> 08:34.087
Yes, yes, of course.
Let me just...

08:37.000 --> 08:38.052
Tea, Henry.

08:43.048 --> 08:45.044
Edie. Thank you.

08:47.040 --> 08:48.854
Right.

08:49.004 --> 08:53.056
You were absolutely right about the
WI being able to cope without me,

08:53.206 --> 08:55.076
so I was just wondering if...

08:55.226 --> 08:57.096
the invitation still stands?

08:59.000 --> 09:00.946
Yes, yes, of course! Wonderful!

09:01.096 --> 09:04.096
May I offer you a celebratory cuppa?

09:04.246 --> 09:06.056
Yes, all right.

09:20.092 --> 09:22.926
A year ago we had Henry's
hanging work

09:23.076 --> 09:27.028
and you were giving us weddings
and funerals at St Mary's.

09:27.178 --> 09:28.854
Now we have nothing.

09:29.004 --> 09:31.431
I was just sharing out the work,
Edie.

09:31.581 --> 09:33.261
You're not the only
florist in the area.

09:33.411 --> 09:35.630
I think we both know
what you're doing

09:35.780 --> 09:38.000
has got nothing to do with fairness.

09:41.072 --> 09:45.096
Look, if you promise to give us
some more business,

09:45.246 --> 09:47.052
I won't enter the flower show.

09:51.060 --> 09:55.020
I think I can win the competition
without your charity.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.092
Thank you, though.

09:58.020 --> 10:02.064
Please, Mrs McCarthy,
we're on our knees here.

10:04.000 --> 10:05.008
Henry?

10:07.028 --> 10:08.469
Henry!

10:08.619 --> 10:10.060
Henry?

10:12.068 --> 10:14.012
Henry!

10:17.028 --> 10:19.008
Father.

10:21.024 --> 10:22.850
Hemlock?

10:23.000 --> 10:27.096
That's what the doctor thinks, going
by Henry's symptoms and the smell.

10:27.246 --> 10:28.934
How extraordinary.

10:29.084 --> 10:34.040
Poor Henry didn't notice the odd
taste and drank the whole cup.

10:34.190 --> 10:37.020
Probably because of his excesses
last night.

10:38.040 --> 10:41.016
How long does the doctor
think he has?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.060
Hours. A day at most.

10:44.076 --> 10:46.080
The Inspector is up with him now.

10:54.056 --> 10:55.934
Father.

10:56.084 --> 10:59.016
What a terrible shock for you both.

11:00.064 --> 11:01.902
Who could have done such a thing?

11:02.052 --> 11:05.052
Edie is quite understandably
wondering whether it was me.

11:05.202 --> 11:07.552
I haven't said a word.
No need to, Edie.

11:07.702 --> 11:09.902
I made the tea
and no-one else touched it.

11:10.052 --> 11:14.028
If I was in your position,
I would think it was me too.

11:14.178 --> 11:16.858
Padre, what a surprise!

11:17.008 --> 11:19.004
Good morning, Inspector Mallory.

11:19.154 --> 11:19.930
Last rites and a murder.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.020
It's Christmas come early for you,
isn't it?

11:23.170 --> 11:24.850
Right, George, with apologies,

11:25.000 --> 11:29.024
I gather you made Henry's tea,
so I'll have to take a statement.

11:29.174 --> 11:30.540
You know the drill.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.906
Yes, of course.

11:32.056 --> 11:33.886
And please search my house.

11:34.036 --> 11:37.064
You don't need a warrant,
I've got nothing to hide.

11:37.214 --> 11:39.096
I don't doubt it. Thank you, though.

11:39.246 --> 11:42.032
Goodfellow. All yours, Padre.

11:54.096 --> 11:57.004
Henry, may I?

12:06.024 --> 12:10.004
I'm here to offer you confession
and absolution. No.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.096
Thank you.

12:15.016 --> 12:16.076
As you wish.

12:18.048 --> 12:20.084
Have you any idea who did
this to you?

12:23.084 --> 12:27.056
May I ask, was that your first cup
of tea of the day?

12:29.004 --> 12:29.926
Yes.

12:30.076 --> 12:33.975
That woman at your party,
Iris Lightman,

12:34.125 --> 12:37.874
and the cover-up
she was talking about.

12:38.024 --> 12:41.870
I never met a mother who
thought their child was guilty.

12:42.020 --> 12:46.040
But do you think she could have
taken her frustration out on you?

12:46.190 --> 12:48.016
It's possible.

12:49.024 --> 12:50.938
Henry, while there is still time,

12:51.088 --> 12:54.048
I will do all that I can
to find out who did this.

12:55.076 --> 12:57.008
I give you my word.

13:06.060 --> 13:09.028
Father. George.

13:10.032 --> 13:11.979
Please don't tell me he's dead.

13:12.129 --> 13:13.926
The Lord in his infinite compassion

13:14.076 --> 13:17.036
has given Henry more time to
say his goodbyes.

13:19.024 --> 13:21.072
I've been praying for some
kind of miracle.

13:23.020 --> 13:25.032
You get on well with Henry,
don't you?

13:27.092 --> 13:32.076
When we met in the Red Lion a year
ago, I was a typical ex-copper.

13:34.032 --> 13:38.060
Drunk, broken marriage, fast
heading for a hole in the ground.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.937
Henry had just given up
the hanging job,

13:42.087 --> 13:44.004
so he wasn't feeling too
great himself.

13:45.040 --> 13:48.862
But he insisted
he wanted to help me.

13:49.012 --> 13:52.064
He put a spade in my hand and
introduced me to the joys of nature.

13:52.214 --> 13:55.060
The Good Samaritan, eh?

13:55.210 --> 13:56.910
George.

13:57.060 --> 14:01.036
Sorry about this but I'm going to
have to bring you in.

14:01.186 --> 14:01.946
Why?

14:02.096 --> 14:06.000
My colleagues found
hemlock in your house.

14:09.096 --> 14:10.918
George is no murderer.

14:11.068 --> 14:12.942
Well, it's not looking good for him.

14:13.092 --> 14:16.020
No, it isn't.
What do you think, Father?

14:20.056 --> 14:23.870
Hemlock. Strange choice of poison.

14:24.020 --> 14:27.946
It paralyses the body slowly
but leaves the mind untouched,

14:28.096 --> 14:32.096
which means it increases the chance
the culprit will be identified.

14:34.016 --> 14:38.008
George would have known that there
are much more clinical toxins.

14:38.158 --> 14:41.000
But if he was the only person to
touch the teacup...

14:41.150 --> 14:43.040
Well, actually we're not
sure that he was.

14:44.048 --> 14:46.064
It was Henry's first tea of the day.

14:48.012 --> 14:51.926
Ground hemlock is brown,
Henry's teacup was brown.

14:52.076 --> 14:56.004
The powder could have been placed
in his cup earlier that morning

14:56.154 --> 14:56.922
and George wouldn't have noticed.

14:57.072 --> 15:00.028
So in theory, anybody
could have done it?

15:00.178 --> 15:01.922
I need to find Iris Lightman.

15:02.072 --> 15:07.052
Her anger when Henry refused to help
her expose the "Max" character was palpable.

15:07.202 --> 15:10.906
What about Edie,
with all her money worries?

15:11.056 --> 15:14.459
She's hasn't exactly been all
sweetness and light, has she?

15:14.609 --> 15:18.012
What did happen to all that cash
that Edie's father had?

15:18.162 --> 15:19.942
Vernon had money? Oh, yeah.

15:20.092 --> 15:23.092
He made an absolute fortune
on the black market during the war.

15:23.242 --> 15:25.890
I had no idea.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.886
Sid, I've got a small job for you.

15:28.036 --> 15:31.032
I want you to find out who
Vernon's solicitor was.

15:33.080 --> 15:35.930
Sidney, your nails are filthy.

15:36.080 --> 15:41.024
You know me, Mrs M, always happy to
get my hands dirty. Ta-ta.

15:43.052 --> 15:45.092
He's helping Edie out in her garden.

15:45.242 --> 15:47.850
Sidney Carter in a garden!

15:48.000 --> 15:49.902
She needs all the help she can get.

15:50.052 --> 15:53.467
Which is why I've decided to enter
best bouquet

15:53.617 --> 15:57.032
in the flower competition on her
behalf. You?

15:58.096 --> 16:00.898
You're serious? Perfectly.

16:01.048 --> 16:04.096
A first prize could be very good
publicity for her right now.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.906
First prize?

16:06.056 --> 16:08.457
I did flower arranging
at finishing school.

16:08.607 --> 16:10.752
I doubt you've ever read
Constance Spry.

16:10.902 --> 16:13.048
No, I have not,
and neither has the Father.

16:13.198 --> 16:16.028
Fortunately, he and I
are of one mind

16:16.178 --> 16:19.008
when it comes to the floral
aesthetic.

16:19.158 --> 16:21.028
Well, we will see about that.

16:23.072 --> 16:26.060
Mrs Lightman! Mrs Lightman!

16:30.076 --> 16:31.983
Father Brown.

16:32.133 --> 16:34.040
From the party.

16:35.064 --> 16:36.894
Did you see Henry?

16:37.044 --> 16:40.068
I didn't get to see him.
The police stopped me.

16:40.218 --> 16:42.890
But you knew he'd been poisoned?

16:43.040 --> 16:45.459
Two policemen woke me up
this morning

16:45.609 --> 16:47.878
asking me if I'd been near his shed.

16:48.028 --> 16:51.020
You must have been very angry with
Henry last night.

16:51.170 --> 16:52.922
Why on earth would
I want to poison him?

16:53.072 --> 16:56.076
He can't help me clear Thomas
if he's dead, can he?

16:58.008 --> 16:59.902
No.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.032
You mentioned being in prison?

17:04.092 --> 17:09.064
On the morning they hanged
Thomas, I attacked a policeman.

17:10.092 --> 17:11.849
Oh. No, well,

17:12.000 --> 17:15.003
I wouldn't have expected someone
like you to understand.

17:15.154 --> 17:17.866
Look, all I know about Henry Lee,
all I care about,

17:18.016 --> 17:21.031
is that he was the last person
to look into my son's eyes.

17:34.044 --> 17:36.076
Morning, Constable. Father.

18:09.012 --> 18:11.060
Shame to throw away such
a handsome volume.

18:14.072 --> 18:15.906
"For Henry,

18:16.056 --> 18:21.096
"the greatest of hangmen,
the greatest of men. Ever, Max."

18:25.016 --> 18:28.088
You didn't know that your friend Max
was Vera Blanchett's killer

18:28.238 --> 18:30.080
until Iris told you last night.

18:32.040 --> 18:35.092
You came home
and threw away his gift in disgust.

18:37.040 --> 18:39.064
Henry, I am only trying to get to
the bottom of this.

18:43.096 --> 18:47.016
Max was a senior judge...

18:51.008 --> 18:54.044
..at the Crown Court where
Vera Blanchett was a secretary.

18:55.060 --> 18:57.024
He took his own life...

18:59.040 --> 19:01.052
..not long after I hanged Thomas.

19:06.056 --> 19:08.056
Now I know why.

19:16.040 --> 19:20.056
George, this was found snagged
on the shed where you made the tea.

19:20.206 --> 19:22.092
Got any ideas?

19:22.242 --> 19:23.902
Yeah.

19:24.052 --> 19:27.020
That woman that Henry had a spat
with at the party last night.

19:27.170 --> 19:30.016
She was wearing a cardigan,
same colour as that.

19:30.166 --> 19:31.874
Iris Lightman?

19:32.024 --> 19:33.886
Is that her name?
Thank you, George.

19:34.036 --> 19:37.008
I'm sure we'll have you
out of here very shortly.

19:43.088 --> 19:44.938
Of all the secretaries I know,

19:45.088 --> 19:48.068
Jean is definitely
one of the most obliging.

19:57.096 --> 19:59.021
Interesting?

19:59.171 --> 20:01.096
I'm afraid so.

20:14.020 --> 20:15.076
All right.

20:16.088 --> 20:19.040
I did go to that flower garden
this morning.

20:21.032 --> 20:25.028
I wanted to punish Henry Lee
for not speaking up.

20:26.032 --> 20:27.890
Punish him how, Iris?

20:28.040 --> 20:30.028
By hitting him with a spade.

20:31.080 --> 20:33.024
A spade? Yes!

20:34.072 --> 20:36.890
But as I stood
there in that garden shed,

20:37.040 --> 20:41.028
I realised it wasn't going to
solve anything, was it? So I left.

20:44.032 --> 20:46.020
That's it? Yes.

20:48.032 --> 20:50.483
OK. So this is what really happened.

20:50.633 --> 20:52.934
You put hemlock in Henry's teacup

20:53.084 --> 20:56.020
and then set up
George Hammond for the crime.

20:56.170 --> 20:57.862
I don't know any George Hammond.

20:58.012 --> 21:00.088
Come on, Iris,
make this easier on yourself.

21:00.238 --> 21:01.930
Where would I get hemlock?

21:02.080 --> 21:05.056
How would I know which
cup to put it in?

21:05.206 --> 21:07.910
It had an "H" on it!

21:08.060 --> 21:11.076
Somebody else's name might have
started with the letter "H", mightn't it?

21:11.226 --> 21:13.082
That was a risk you were
ready to take

21:13.232 --> 21:14.938
because you're that kind of person,
Iris.

21:15.088 --> 21:18.040
You're only two days out of prison
for maiming a policeman,

21:18.190 --> 21:19.056
for heaven's sake!

21:21.040 --> 21:22.918
This is what they did to my Thomas.

21:23.068 --> 21:27.028
You lot,
you forced a confession out of him!

21:28.068 --> 21:32.036
Well, you'll not put any
words in my mouth.

21:36.084 --> 21:39.004
Just looking for a picture
of your father.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.004
There aren't any.

21:43.004 --> 21:45.036
Oh. Why?

21:48.040 --> 21:50.890
I know Vernon was a libertarian.

21:51.040 --> 21:53.084
I know he opposed your marriage
to Henry.

21:56.068 --> 21:58.878
What's this about, Father?

21:59.028 --> 22:02.072
I understand your father left you
a quite substantial sum,

22:02.222 --> 22:04.866
to be withheld until such time

22:05.016 --> 22:08.020
as Henry Lee was no longer your
lawful husband.

22:09.096 --> 22:14.040
My father's money has nothing
whatsoever to do with Henry,

22:14.190 --> 22:16.092
or me, or you!

22:35.040 --> 22:37.048
Mrs McCarthy? Good gracious!

22:38.084 --> 22:41.060
Anyone would think you were
spying on those two.

22:41.210 --> 22:44.000
Why ever would I do that?
I have no idea.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.080
I fear I may have found our culprit.

22:49.044 --> 22:52.088
Upon Henry Lee's death, it turns out
that Edie is entitled to

22:52.238 --> 22:57.040
her father's not insubstantial
inheritance.

22:57.190 --> 23:00.858
Inheritance?
But that makes no sense.

23:01.008 --> 23:03.457
When Henry was about to drink that
cup of tea,

23:03.607 --> 23:06.056
Edie was begging me
to give her some business.

23:06.206 --> 23:07.886
She was almost in tears.

23:08.036 --> 23:11.938
Now, Edie Lee is a proud,
proud woman.

23:12.088 --> 23:17.056
She'd never humiliate herself
like that if what you say is true.

23:17.206 --> 23:19.534
I see.

23:19.684 --> 23:21.862
Oh, dear.

23:22.012 --> 23:23.068
That poor woman.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.910
Father? Yes?

23:28.060 --> 23:29.922
I have to confess that my feelings

23:30.072 --> 23:32.493
were very hurt last year
at the flower show.

23:32.643 --> 23:35.064
Ah, yes.
I am extremely sorry about that.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.020
No. No, not just by you.

23:39.060 --> 23:41.999
When I looked at Edie's flower
arrangement,

23:42.149 --> 23:44.938
I realised mine
would never be as good.

23:45.088 --> 23:50.088
And I think I've been punishing
her for that ever since.

23:50.238 --> 23:53.068
That was very brave of you to say so.

23:53.218 --> 23:56.048
And God, I am sure, will forgive you.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.914
Thank you. Thank you, Father.

24:00.064 --> 24:03.040
Now, I'll see you back at St Mary's.

24:05.064 --> 24:07.084
I just pray to God we're
not too late.

24:07.234 --> 24:09.906
Me too, George.
Father?

24:10.056 --> 24:13.004
Good Afternoon, Lady Felicia!

24:13.154 --> 24:14.052
Good work, Sid!

24:20.068 --> 24:22.040
George! Father.

24:24.072 --> 24:26.036
How are you, Henry?

24:28.008 --> 24:32.080
Mr Lee, the good news is we've got
your man. Well, woman.

24:32.230 --> 24:35.020
It turns out Iris Lightman
did this to you.

24:36.028 --> 24:38.060
Popped into your shed first
thing yesterday

24:38.210 --> 24:40.532
and slipped hemlock in your teacup.

24:40.682 --> 24:42.792
The one thing I don't understand is

24:42.942 --> 24:45.052
why she's tried to fit up
George here.

24:45.202 --> 24:46.858
I've never met the woman, Henry.

24:47.008 --> 24:48.096
Don't have any thoughts on it,
do you?

24:48.246 --> 24:50.036
I saw her at the shed...

24:52.040 --> 24:54.024
..this morning.

24:56.024 --> 24:58.854
She didn't put poison in my cup.

24:59.004 --> 25:01.971
Well, Mrs Lightman didn't
mention meeting you.

25:02.121 --> 25:05.088
How come you've said
nothing about it till now?

25:05.238 --> 25:06.926
It's the truth.

25:07.076 --> 25:08.946
That woman poisoned you,

25:09.096 --> 25:12.048
so why on earth would you want
to cover for her?

25:12.198 --> 25:14.000
She didn't do it.

25:15.068 --> 25:17.060
Right. Fair enough.

25:19.024 --> 25:20.914
I'm done here, George.

25:21.064 --> 25:23.076
I'll stay here with Henry. No!

25:27.084 --> 25:29.064
Just leave me alone...

25:29.214 --> 25:31.012
all of you!

25:33.056 --> 25:35.878
Iris has motive, opportunity,
previous,

25:36.028 --> 25:40.000
and what's more she's lied to us.
We've easily got enough.

25:44.036 --> 25:45.894
You've met her, Father.

25:46.044 --> 25:48.056
Do you think she did it? No.

25:50.024 --> 25:51.080
But I don't know who did.

25:53.008 --> 25:55.076
Why is Henry behaving
so strangely towards me?

25:55.226 --> 25:57.064
I don't know that either.

25:58.080 --> 26:00.024
But let him rest.

26:01.092 --> 26:04.016
Haven't you got an appointment
this lunchtime?

26:10.060 --> 26:14.032
Mrs McCarthy, sorry I'm a bit late.

26:14.182 --> 26:14.918
But I thought you were...

26:15.068 --> 26:18.088
Inspector Mallory has
arrested Iris Lightman.

26:18.238 --> 26:20.942
And as Henry wants to be
left alone...

26:21.092 --> 26:25.040
The inspector's also arranged a car
to drop us off in Cheltenham.

26:25.190 --> 26:26.882
Oh!

26:27.032 --> 26:28.084
Oh, they're beautiful!

26:33.004 --> 26:34.898
That is very...

26:35.048 --> 26:36.938
I'll just go and get myself ready.

26:37.088 --> 26:40.064
There's no need.
You look delightful as you are.

26:41.096 --> 26:43.862
At least let me change my hat.

26:44.012 --> 26:46.060
And I'll just put these in water.
Of course.

26:51.008 --> 26:52.072
Thank you.

26:55.064 --> 27:00.044
I can't remember the last time
I was in such a fancy place.

27:00.194 --> 27:02.560
Neither can I, Mrs McCarthy.

27:02.710 --> 27:05.076
Bridget, please. Thank you.

27:13.024 --> 27:15.040
I'm very glad you changed your mind.

27:17.048 --> 27:21.020
Now, I hear the Dover sole is
particularly nice.

27:30.020 --> 27:32.008
Ah, Sid. Father.

27:36.056 --> 27:36.926
Bon appetit.

27:37.076 --> 27:39.975
Well, I wouldn't want Mrs M's
flan going to waste,

27:40.125 --> 27:43.024
what with her being otherwise
engaged, you know.

27:43.174 --> 27:45.040
Oh! How lovely.

27:48.032 --> 27:51.068
"If I had a flower for every time
I thought of you,

27:51.218 --> 27:54.004
"I could walk through my garden
forever."

27:54.154 --> 27:56.068
Quite the poet, old George. No.

27:58.008 --> 27:59.048
That's Tennyson.

28:02.068 --> 28:04.092
Oh, dear. What?

28:06.032 --> 28:09.012
I fear Mrs McCarthy is having
lunch with a murderer.

28:09.162 --> 28:10.850
You're kidding.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.092
Let's just pray she's careful
what she says.

28:19.056 --> 28:23.044
All I know is, a man named Max
murdered a girl called Vera.

28:24.044 --> 28:28.000
Well, anyway, that's what this Iris
woman told Henry.

28:29.048 --> 28:30.938
George?

28:31.088 --> 28:32.979
Are you all right?

28:33.129 --> 28:35.020
Yes. Yes, I'm fine.

28:37.064 --> 28:42.092
Well, I'll just visit the powder
room. Of course.

28:57.004 --> 28:57.926
You sure Mrs McCarthy's in
danger?

28:58.076 --> 28:59.910
George may well have poisoned
Henry

29:00.060 --> 29:03.012
to stop him revealing that he killed
Vera Blanchett.

29:03.162 --> 29:05.060
And if George did that to Henry...
Exactly.

29:09.044 --> 29:10.886
Oh, that looks lovely.

29:11.036 --> 29:14.000
I've taken the liberty of pouring
you some wine.

29:14.150 --> 29:15.060
Oh! Why not?

29:17.028 --> 29:20.056
Here's to you, Bridget,
and to Henry.

29:20.206 --> 29:22.096
Of course. To poor Henry.

29:28.056 --> 29:31.088
Oh, It's quite sharp.
Maybe even a little bitter.

29:32.088 --> 29:34.096
Try the fish. Yes.

29:40.088 --> 29:41.898
Mrs McCarthy.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.981
What are you... George.

29:44.131 --> 29:45.914
What on earth is going on?!

29:46.064 --> 29:49.001
I'm afraid there has been
a fire at St Mary's. A fire!

29:49.151 --> 29:52.502
Now, the Fire Brigade have it under
control, Mrs McCarthy,

29:52.652 --> 29:56.004
but I need you to go back with Sid
and sort out a few things.

29:56.154 --> 29:57.930
But I haven't even started my
dinner. I'm so sorry.

29:58.080 --> 30:02.032
But all things considered,
I think we've had a lucky escape.

30:02.182 --> 30:04.890
Right. Shall we? The Rolls, Mrs M?

30:05.040 --> 30:08.048
Why didn't you just telephone
the restaurant?

30:08.198 --> 30:10.076
The line was engaged.

30:12.092 --> 30:15.068
There isn't really a fire at
St Mary's, is there?

30:18.076 --> 30:21.012
) George is Max.

30:24.056 --> 30:31.044
Well, I think I had better get back,
just, just in case... Good idea.

30:31.194 --> 30:33.080
I hope we can do this again,
Bridget?

30:33.230 --> 30:35.068
Oh, yes! Of course!

30:47.004 --> 30:50.012
I'd like to eat this fish
but I don't think it would be safe.

30:53.060 --> 30:56.000
I know you killed Vera Blanchett...

30:57.064 --> 31:00.004
..and let an innocent boy
swing for it.

31:03.028 --> 31:06.441
I don't know what you're
talking about, Father.

31:06.591 --> 31:09.854
Your work took you to the
Crown Court regularly.

31:10.004 --> 31:12.060
That's where you met Vera.
She was young, impressionable.

31:12.210 --> 31:14.072
You were a Detective Sergeant.

31:15.084 --> 31:17.036
How could she refuse you?

31:18.056 --> 31:20.854
But she did.

31:21.004 --> 31:24.056
And that's when it went horribly,
horribly wrong.

31:26.084 --> 31:30.032
I presume Max is your middle name?

31:31.048 --> 31:35.064
If you leave this restaurant
I will call the police.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.044
Was it your idea to pin Vera's
murder onto Thomas?

31:46.044 --> 31:49.032
It was my boss's idea,
and his boss's.

31:52.076 --> 31:58.000
To protect their reputation
and the "good name" of the police?

31:58.150 --> 32:00.000
But I did nothing to stop them!

32:09.096 --> 32:11.092
Did you poison Henry too?

32:11.242 --> 32:14.850
What? No!

32:15.000 --> 32:16.088
Surely he needed to be silenced.

32:18.012 --> 32:20.479
Thanks to Iris
he knew that you were Vera's killer.

32:20.629 --> 32:23.096
But I only just found that out
from Mrs McCarthy.

32:32.084 --> 32:35.886
Father, I have done some monstrous
things in my time

32:36.036 --> 32:42.028
but believe me, I would never,
ever harm Henry or Mrs McCarthy.

32:52.048 --> 32:54.024
Mm.

32:55.024 --> 32:56.862
In the time I have known you,

32:57.012 --> 32:59.878
I have always sensed you wanted
to be a good man.

33:00.028 --> 33:03.068
Do you want what happened to Thomas
to ever happen again? Of course not.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.906
Then go to Inspector Mallory,

33:07.056 --> 33:10.479
confess your crime
and expose your superiors

33:10.629 --> 33:13.277
and the corrupt system that
protected you.

33:13.427 --> 33:16.076
Father, I'm not sure that
I'm brave enough.

33:21.016 --> 33:22.076
I think you are.

33:24.016 --> 33:25.854
God has given you the chance

33:26.004 --> 33:29.032
to salvage some greater
good from your acts.

33:30.060 --> 33:35.008
I strongly suggest that you do
the right thing.

33:45.048 --> 33:47.862
Afternoon, sir.
Is the Inspector in?

33:48.012 --> 33:51.032
He is, sir, yes.
Go straight through. Thank you.

33:53.000 --> 33:58.024
Oh, Sergeant, there's a man outside,
he's behaving rather strangely.

33:58.174 --> 34:01.052
I think he must be drunk.
Is there? Right.

34:02.060 --> 34:04.016
Thanks.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.043
I've got nothing more to say.

34:35.047 --> 34:38.080
Mrs Lightman? Who are you?

34:38.230 --> 34:40.024
I'm Max.

34:43.076 --> 34:46.004
I am so very sorry...

34:47.063 --> 34:49.076
..for what I did to Vera
and to your son.

34:54.080 --> 34:56.040
How did you get in here?

34:58.004 --> 35:01.016
I want to confess to the
murder of Vera Blanchett...

35:02.076 --> 35:06.044
..and to my role in a barbaric
police cover-up.

35:08.004 --> 35:10.008
You what?

35:14.032 --> 35:16.088
I should have known it was too
good to be true.

35:18.052 --> 35:19.906
Come now, Mrs McCarthy.

35:20.056 --> 35:24.040
Not every man who invites you out to
lunch will turn out to be a murderer.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.028
And I didn't even get to taste
the Dover sole.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.096
It is the merest of consolation,
but I do believe that George

35:31.246 --> 35:35.050
is repentant about what he did
to Vera and Thomas.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.004
And I suppose that's why
he poisoned Henry as well.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.096
I'm not convinced it was him,
actually.

35:42.246 --> 35:44.554
How can you even question it?

35:44.704 --> 35:47.012
His denial seemed sincere.

35:48.056 --> 35:50.495
And I don't believe
he would have chosen hemlock.

35:50.645 --> 35:53.084
Nobody in their right mind would
choose hemlock.

35:53.234 --> 35:56.910
Plato did.
Or was that the other one?

35:57.060 --> 36:01.068
Socrates. Yes, him, exactly.
Of course. Of course!

36:03.028 --> 36:06.036
And all because you stayed
for a cup of tea.

36:06.186 --> 36:09.004
You are a genius, Mrs McCarthy.

36:16.088 --> 36:21.020
Socrates chose hemlock for his own
execution, and so did you.

36:21.170 --> 36:21.946
What?

36:22.096 --> 36:26.008
Thomas Lightman showed you that
the justice system

36:26.158 --> 36:27.878
you had given your life to
was corrupt.

36:28.028 --> 36:32.060
Made you wonder how many other
innocent people you had hanged.

36:34.028 --> 36:39.032
The shock made you give up your job,
the Church and embrace the bottle.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.068
I suspect you were looking
for life's exit door

36:45.218 --> 36:47.060
before you left your own party.

36:48.096 --> 36:52.479
But when Iris Lightman told you
the name of the monster

36:52.629 --> 36:57.012
who had caused you all this grief,
it was the final straw.

36:59.080 --> 37:04.024
And you had to know George very
well to know that he was Max.

37:05.048 --> 37:08.076
And you did, didn't you, Henry?

37:08.226 --> 37:10.048
What is this?

37:12.032 --> 37:14.028
I'm afraid this is the truth.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.052
But you didn't want your suicide
to be in vain,

37:18.202 --> 37:20.874
you wanted justice
for Vera and Thomas.

37:21.024 --> 37:25.072
But the problem was, you didn't
trust the police

37:25.222 --> 37:27.914
to deal with their own corruption.

37:28.064 --> 37:32.048
So you had to put
George on the scaffold yourself.

37:33.072 --> 37:37.012
So you left traces of hemlock
in George's house

37:37.162 --> 37:38.874
and kept the rest with you.

37:39.024 --> 37:45.092
Then when Mrs McCarthy came to the
garden, you put it in your tea,

37:45.242 --> 37:48.088
knowing that she would confirm
George had made it.

37:48.238 --> 37:51.016
George Hammond did this to me.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.004
That's what you want
the police to believe.

37:57.064 --> 38:00.004
And that's why you protected Iris.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.084
Don't worry, Henry.

38:04.016 --> 38:06.858
As I speak,
George is in the Police Station,

38:07.008 --> 38:10.052
confessing to the murder of Vera.
You will get your justice.

38:16.004 --> 38:17.882
One question.

38:18.032 --> 38:22.032
When you heard the name Max, why
were you certain that was George?

38:25.020 --> 38:29.016
Thomas told me
that Vera was killed by a policeman.

38:35.064 --> 38:37.056
Will I go to hell for this, Father?

38:39.052 --> 38:41.056
Jesus commanded us not to judge.

38:43.076 --> 38:45.072
God will have the final judgment.

38:48.044 --> 38:50.012
But I tell you this...

38:51.040 --> 38:54.080
Not for one second has
He left your side.

39:08.020 --> 39:11.064
I've just been on the phone to the
Chief Constable.

39:11.214 --> 39:14.044
You're free to go. What?

39:15.076 --> 39:18.036
You can't do this.
I'm just following orders.

39:19.036 --> 39:20.088
I'm not going.

39:22.024 --> 39:24.084
You know what I think,
Detective Inspector?

39:26.052 --> 39:28.985
That a bent copper is worse
than any criminal.

39:29.135 --> 39:32.068
That you should swing
and heads should roll.

39:34.020 --> 39:37.445
But it's not me who decides, is it?

39:37.595 --> 39:41.020
It can be, if you want it to be.

39:44.052 --> 39:46.995
Look, I'll get Goodfellow to throw
you out if I have to.

39:47.145 --> 39:49.938
Inspector Mallory, if you do not
charge me with the murder

39:50.088 --> 39:53.999
of Vera Blanchett, then I will add
your name to the list that I give to

39:54.149 --> 39:58.060
the newspapers of all the coppers
involved in this sordid business.

39:58.210 --> 40:02.028
And as the roof of this constabulary
comes crashing down,

40:02.178 --> 40:04.008
you too will be buried forever.

40:11.024 --> 40:12.096
Thank you.

40:19.068 --> 40:23.056
I'm sorry that I've ended up...

40:24.068 --> 40:25.894
..bringing you down with me.

40:26.044 --> 40:30.016
At this moment
I just want to come with you.

40:30.166 --> 40:34.076
No, Edie, you must stay and fight.

40:36.072 --> 40:38.016
Your father's money...

40:39.088 --> 40:42.012
...I want you to take it.

40:43.020 --> 40:46.020
What? No. Don't ask that. Please.

40:47.044 --> 40:48.068
Henry.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.008
Keeping our business alive...

40:55.020 --> 40:59.012
..that will be... keeping us alive.

41:03.048 --> 41:05.016
Thank you.

41:11.024 --> 41:14.044
You are the best thing... that ever
happened...

41:15.088 --> 41:17.040
..in my life.

41:22.028 --> 41:24.024
Oh, Henry.

41:28.056 --> 41:30.004
Edie.

41:46.076 --> 41:48.971
"The stream will cease to flow.

41:49.121 --> 41:52.005
"The wind will cease to blow.

41:52.155 --> 41:54.542
"The clouds will cease to fleet.

41:54.692 --> 41:57.285
"The heart will cease to beat.

41:57.435 --> 42:00.028
"For all things must die."

42:03.056 --> 42:05.866
Henry chose hemlock.

42:06.016 --> 42:08.048
He wanted to say a proper
goodbye to Edie.

42:09.060 --> 42:13.012
Come on, Sid, we've got
a competition to win for Edie.

42:14.064 --> 42:15.882
The flower show!

42:16.032 --> 42:18.453
I forgot all about that.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.874
Lady Felicia? Yes, Mrs M?

42:21.024 --> 42:25.016
I was wondering if you might
like one or two suggestions from me

42:25.166 --> 42:28.012
as to which flowers might catch
Father Brown's eye?

42:28.162 --> 42:31.008
I thought you wanted to win
the trophy for yourself?

42:31.158 --> 42:33.036
Yes, well, I've had a change
of heart.

42:34.068 --> 42:36.032
Thank you.

43:08.004 --> 43:09.060
The winner!

43:14.012 --> 43:14.914
For Edie Lee.

43:15.064 --> 43:18.092
The grower of the best flowers
in the whole of the Cotswolds!

43:20.072 --> 43:21.854
And next Monday,

43:22.004 --> 43:25.036
I will be hiring Edie as the florist
for the Websters' wedding.

43:25.186 --> 43:26.092
Excellent.

43:28.088 --> 43:30.503
You look relieved, Father.

43:30.653 --> 43:33.068
That was the toughest yet.

43:33.218 --> 43:34.862
Thanks for the steer.

43:35.012 --> 43:36.858
Anything for a peaceful life, eh?

43:37.008 --> 43:38.935
Partners in crime.
Who'd have thought it?

43:39.085 --> 43:41.012
You know what,
when those two get together,

43:41.162 --> 43:44.006
they really are a deadly
combination.

43:44.156 --> 43:46.850
Of course the real reason we won is

43:47.000 --> 43:50.036
because I knew exactly which blooms
Father Brown favoured.

43:50.186 --> 43:51.942
What rot! If I hadn't been to
finishing school,

43:52.092 --> 43:56.020
the whole thing would have been
an unmitigated disaster!
