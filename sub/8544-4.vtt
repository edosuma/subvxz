ON "THE MENTALIST"...WHO'S THAT?

00:04.091 --> 00:06.006
BOB KIRKLAND,
HOMELAND SECURITY.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.095
DO I KNOW YOU?NO, BUT I KNOW YOU.

00:09.487 --> 00:10.967
GET ME EVERYTHING.

00:10.967 --> 00:13.100
JANE MADE A LOT OF RED JOHN
CONNECTIONS HERE.

00:13.100 --> 00:15.841
THIS IS GOOD.[Lisbon] WHY IS THIS
A HOMELAND SECURITY ISSUE?

00:15.841 --> 00:17.713
[Kirkland] IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:22.674 --> 00:24.981
AGENT LISBON, JANE,
CBI.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.504
F.B.I. PERSONNEL ONLY.

00:26.504 --> 00:28.158
UH, WE DON'T WANT TO BE HERE,
EITHER,

00:28.158 --> 00:29.681
BUT WE WERE INVITED.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.248
UH, COULD YOU TELL
AGENT REEDE SMITH

00:31.248 --> 00:32.684
THAT WE'RE HERE
AS REQUESTED?

00:32.684 --> 00:35.644
[police radio chatter]

00:35.644 --> 00:37.863
WHAT DO YOU THINK
SMITH WANTS?

00:37.863 --> 00:40.214
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:40.214 --> 00:42.433
EVERY TIME WE GO TO SEE
ONE OF THESE RED JOHN SUSPECTS,

00:42.433 --> 00:43.521
I GET EDGY.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.827
REALLY? CAN'T TELL.

00:44.827 --> 00:46.046
REALLY?

00:46.046 --> 00:47.525
OH.

00:47.525 --> 00:50.354
JANE, LISBON.
THANKS FOR COMING.

00:50.354 --> 00:54.489
MISS THIS?
WHO COULD SAY NO?

00:54.489 --> 00:57.361
HOW CAN WE BE OF HELP,
AGENT SMITH?

00:57.361 --> 00:58.623
WE CAUGHT A BODY.

00:58.623 --> 01:00.364
I THOUGHT IT MIGHT
INTEREST YOU.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.279
AND WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

01:02.279 --> 01:03.933
YOU TELL ME.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.763
[inhales sharply]

01:07.763 --> 01:08.851
[exhales]

01:17.686 --> 01:19.296
THIS IS BENJAMIN MARX.

01:19.296 --> 01:20.689
THE GUY YOU BURIED ALIVE.

01:20.689 --> 01:22.212
EXCUSE ME.

01:22.212 --> 01:25.172
THE KILLERI BURIED ALIVE.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.304
AND I DID LET HIM OUT--
EVENTUALLY.

01:27.304 --> 01:30.307
NOT BAD.
THAT'S A TOUGH I.D.,

01:30.307 --> 01:33.180
CONSIDERING MOST OF HIS
FACE IS BURNT OFF.

01:33.180 --> 01:34.572
WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO HIM?

01:34.572 --> 01:36.400
YOU'RE THE F.B.I.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.315
I-I'M SURE YOU HAVE
THE ANSWERS ALREADY.

01:38.315 --> 01:40.665
OKAY.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.232
TELL ME
WHAT I'VE COME UP WITH.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.278
WELL, THE FIRST THING
YOU'D NOTICE

01:44.278 --> 01:46.193
IS THAT HE WAS TORTURED--

01:46.193 --> 01:47.977
WITH FIRE AND WHATEVER IT IS
PEOPLE USE

01:47.977 --> 01:49.848
TO CUT SOMEONE'S THUMBS OFF.

01:49.848 --> 01:52.068
AND WHAT DO I THINK
HE WAS TORTURED FOR?

01:52.068 --> 01:53.939
WELL, YOUR GUESS WOULD BE
SADISTIC PLEASURE,

01:53.939 --> 01:55.463
BUT YOU'D BE WRONG.

01:55.463 --> 01:57.117
MORE LIKELY HE WAS TORTURED
FOR INFORMATION--

01:57.117 --> 01:58.944
INFORMATION
THAT HE DIDN'T HAVE.

01:58.944 --> 02:00.946
HOW DO YOU KNOW
HE DIDN'T HAVE IT?BECAUSE IF HE HAD IT,

02:00.946 --> 02:03.297
THE KILLER WOULD ONLY HAVE HAD
TO BURN OFF HALF HIS FACE.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.300
WHAT ELSE DO I THINK?

02:06.300 --> 02:08.824
WELL, WHOEVER DID THE TORTURING
TOOK THEIR TIME,

02:08.824 --> 02:12.219
SO YOU WOULD REASON THAT THEY
HAD SOMEWHERE PRIVATE TO DO IT.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.308
RIGHT.AND I'M SURE YOU SAW

02:14.308 --> 02:17.441
THE, UH, STICKY STUFF
ON THE LEG OF THE VICTIM,

02:17.441 --> 02:18.964
PROBABLY SENT IT OFF
TO THE LAB.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.618
[sniffs] AND IN THREE DAYS
THEY'LL TELL YOU

02:20.618 --> 02:22.229
THAT IT'S PINE SAP,
WHICH MAKES SENSE,

02:22.229 --> 02:23.447
BECAUSE THERE'S A BROKEN
PINE NEEDLE

02:23.447 --> 02:25.319
WEDGED INTO THE SOLE
OF HIS SHOE.

02:25.319 --> 02:27.625
YEAH, I SEE.EVENTUALLY YOU'D
COME TO THE CONCLUSION

02:27.625 --> 02:30.324
THAT HE WAS KEPT
IN THE WOODS SOMEPLACE

02:30.324 --> 02:32.891
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED
AND DUMPED HERE.

02:32.891 --> 02:35.067
NICE.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.592
UH, WHY ARE WE HERE,
AGENT SMITH?

02:37.592 --> 02:40.986
MARX WAS OUT ON BAIL
WHILE HE STOOD TRIAL.

02:40.986 --> 02:43.337
THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD
FOR HIM, TOO.

02:43.337 --> 02:45.643
I MEAN, YOU TORTURED HIM
INTO A CONFESSION,

02:45.643 --> 02:47.297
SO A LITTLE GOOD LAWYERING,

02:47.297 --> 02:49.169
A LITTLE LUCK,
AND HE COULD WALK.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.693
BET THAT REALLY CHAPPED
YOUR HIDE, HUH, JANE?

02:51.693 --> 02:53.434
NOT AT ALL.

02:53.434 --> 02:56.480
THAT'S THE BEST THEORY
THE F.B.I. CAN COME UP WITH?

02:56.480 --> 03:00.136
THAT JANE KILLED BENJAMIN MARX
AND BURNED HIS FACE OFF?

03:00.136 --> 03:02.399
WE'RE EXPLORING EVERY ANGLE.

03:02.399 --> 03:04.271
HE'S AN ANGLE.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.187
LISTEN. IF I WANTED
TO KILL BENJAMIN MARX,

03:07.187 --> 03:09.014
I WOULD HAVE DONE IT
THE FIRST TIME.

03:09.014 --> 03:12.235
HE WAS A SOCIOPATH THAT STOLE
FROM WIDOWS AND ORPHANS,

03:12.235 --> 03:14.498
AND HE GOT WHAT HE DESERVED.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.674
BUT I DIDN'T DO IT.

03:16.674 --> 03:18.415
WE'LL SEE.

03:18.415 --> 03:20.896
YES, WE WILL.

03:20.896 --> 03:24.334
THANKS FOR COMING.

03:24.334 --> 03:25.466
[police radio chatter]

03:25.466 --> 03:27.119
WHAT'S GOING ON, JANE?NOTHING.

03:27.119 --> 03:29.209
TELL ME.I SAID IT'S NOTHING.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.428
IT'S NEVER NOTHING WITH YOU.

03:31.428 --> 03:33.300
DO YOU THINK SMITH
IS RED JOHN?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.823
POSSIBLY.

03:34.823 --> 03:36.346
WELL, IF HE ISN'T RED JOHN,
HE'S AN IDIOT

03:36.346 --> 03:37.826
FOR THINKING YOU COULD HAVE
ANYTHING TO DO

03:37.826 --> 03:39.001
WITH MARX'S DEATH.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.394
HE'S NOT COMPLETELY WRONG.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.657
I MEAN, I-I DIDN'T KILL
BENJAMIN MARX,

03:42.657 --> 03:44.485
BUT I MIGHT HAVE
GOTTEN HIM KILLED.

03:46.443 --> 03:49.446
♪♪♪

03:49.446 --> 03:53.363
--Captions by VITAC--

03:57.498 --> 04:00.109
OKAY, NO MORE SECRETS.
SPILL IT NOW.

04:00.109 --> 04:01.893
I WAS CONCERNED
WITH SECURITY

04:01.893 --> 04:03.939
WHEN I WAS WORKING MY LIST
OF RED JOHN SUSPECTS.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.332
OBSESSIVELY SECRETIVE.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.116
YEAH, WELL,
YOU SAY "TOMATO,"

04:07.116 --> 04:09.727
BUT I KNEW THERE WERE PEOPLE
THAT NEEDED THAT INFORMATION.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.556
SO I PLANTED
WHAT YOU WOULD CALL

04:12.556 --> 04:14.776
MISINFORMATION
ON MY CRIME BOARD.

04:14.776 --> 04:16.299
SO WHOEVER SAW YOUR CRIME BOARD

04:16.299 --> 04:18.083
GOT THE LIST
OF THE SEVEN RED JOHN SUSPECTS.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.563
BUT THEY WOULD BE
THE WRONG SUSPECTS.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.912
EXACTLY. AND IT WORKED.

04:20.912 --> 04:22.523
SOMEONE BROKE INTO
MY OFFICE.

04:22.523 --> 04:23.915
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

04:23.915 --> 04:25.830
WELL, I SET A TRAP,
AND IT WAS SPRUNG.

04:25.830 --> 04:29.007
NOW THIS PERSON HAS A FAKE LIST
OF RED JOHN SUSPECTS,

04:29.007 --> 04:31.619
AND BENJAMIN MARX
WAS ON THAT LIST.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.404
SO SOMEBODY IS TORTURING
AND KILLING

04:34.404 --> 04:36.276
THE PEOPLE ON YOUR FAKE LIST.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.973
WHOA, WHOA.
N-NOT NECESSARILY.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.932
SOMEONE TORTURED AND KILLED
ONE PERSON FROM MY LIST.

04:40.932 --> 04:44.414
BUT THEORETICALLY, HIS DEATH
COULD BE ABOUT ANYTHING.

04:44.414 --> 04:45.720
HE WASN'T A NICE MAN.

04:47.374 --> 04:50.202
I AM TRYING TO WRAP
MY MIND AROUND THIS.

04:50.202 --> 04:53.162
YOU PUT THE LIVES OF SEVEN
INNOCENT PEOPLE IN DANGER.

04:53.162 --> 04:55.033
NO. NONE OF THEM
ARE INNOCENT.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.818
MARX DEFRAUDED
HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE...[lock clatters]

04:56.818 --> 04:58.602
THEN HE BRUTALLY MURDERED
SOMEONE TO COVER IT UP.

I ASSURE YOU, LISBON...[lock clicks]

05:00.822 --> 05:03.041
ALL OF THESE MEN
ARE VERY BAD.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.783
THEY JUST DON'T HAPPEN
TO BE RED JOHN.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.050
[lock clicks]DO YOU THINK THE REAL RED JOHN
COULD HAVE BROKEN IN HERE

05:12.050 --> 05:13.661
AND KILLED MARX?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.619
WELL, RED JOHN IS THE ONLY
PERSON BESIDES US

05:15.619 --> 05:17.534
THAT KNOWS
THE REAL LIST OF SUSPECTS,

05:17.534 --> 05:20.842
SO HE IS THE ONLY PERSON THAT
HAS NO MOTIVE TO DO THIS.

05:20.842 --> 05:22.496
THEN WHO BROKE IN HERE?

05:22.496 --> 05:24.367
I DON'T KNOW.

05:24.367 --> 05:27.675
SOMEONE WITH EASY ACCESS,
A LOT OF RESOURCES AND POWER.

05:27.675 --> 05:29.720

THEY'VE BEEN WANTING

05:29.720 --> 05:31.896
TO GET THEIR HANDS ON
THE RED JOHN CASE FOR A WHILE.

05:31.896 --> 05:34.159
THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WHEN
HOMELAND SECURITY TOOK OVER.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.292
TRUE.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.947
YOU KNOW, I'VE ALWAYS SUSPECTED
THE F.B.I. ARE WATCHING ME.

05:38.947 --> 05:40.209
PERSONALLY.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.385
AS PARANOID AS IT SOUNDS,

05:42.385 --> 05:44.866
IT WOULD EXPLAIN HOW THEY
GOT THE MARX CASE.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.520
BUT WHY WOULD THEY
DO THIS TO HIM?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.043
AND HOW DO WE PROCEED?

05:48.043 --> 05:49.523
I CAN'T JUST GO TO THE F.B.I.
AND ASK THEM

05:49.523 --> 05:51.220
IF THEY KILLED MARX.

05:51.220 --> 05:53.396
IF THE F.B.I. HAS BEEN
WATCHING ME,

05:53.396 --> 05:55.703
I'LL BET THAT SOMEONE VERY
HIGH UP IN THE CBI

05:55.703 --> 05:58.140
AUTHORIZED IT,
OR AT LEAST WENT ALONG WITH IT.

05:58.140 --> 05:59.663
I NEED TO TALK TO THEM.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.710
BERTRAM. BUT YOU OBVIOUSLY
CAN'T ASK HIM.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.320
MADELEINE HIGHTOWER THEN.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.713
HIGHTOWER?

06:05.713 --> 06:07.628
SHE HASN'T RUN THE CBI
IN THREE YEARS.

06:07.628 --> 06:10.457
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION DO YOU
THINK SHE STILL HAS ACCESS TO?

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
AND IF SO, WHY WOULD SHE
SHARE IT WITH YOU?

06:12.415 --> 06:14.112
WELL, RED JOHN
TRIED TO KILL HER.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.636
SHE'S GONNA WANT TO HELP ME.

06:15.636 --> 06:17.246
UNLESS SHE BLAMES YOU.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.858
EH. I'M GONNA CALL HER.

06:20.858 --> 06:22.469

PLANNED FOR THE DAY?

06:24.514 --> 06:26.429

HAVE A CASE, DO YOU?

YOU CAN RELAX.

WITH HIM ONCE BEFORE,

08:32.555 --> 08:34.165
THEN WE HAD TO WORK
THE NEXT DAY.

08:34.165 --> 08:35.993
AND SINCE THEN, SARA'S
AT A CONFERENCE IN L.A.,

08:35.993 --> 08:37.995
SO WE'VE HAD BEN EVERY DAY,
MORNING AND NIGHT.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.388
YOU KNOW, I READ
A STUDY ON THE INTERNET.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.694
IT SAID WOMEN LOSE INTEREST
IN SEX

08:40.694 --> 08:41.564
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY
AFTER MARRIAGE.

08:41.564 --> 08:43.000
IT'S DARWINIAN.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.569
NAH, NOT GRACE.
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN SUPER INTO...

08:46.569 --> 08:49.006
M-MY POINT IS, I DON'T
BELIEVE IT. IT'S NOT TRUE.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.443
I'M JUST TELLING YOU
WHAT THE INTERNET SAID.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.498
RICK DORT? CBI.
OPEN UP.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.413
ANYONE CAN SAY ANYTHING
ON THE INTERNET.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.849
DOESN'T MEAN IT'S TRUE.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.068
[TV playing indistinctly]

09:07.068 --> 09:08.765
YEAH?

09:08.765 --> 09:11.246
MR. DORT? AGENTS RIGSBY AND CHO
FROM THE CBI.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.682
WE WANT TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT--[grunts]

09:12.682 --> 09:15.598
[grunting]

09:20.908 --> 09:22.779
[grunts]

09:24.128 --> 09:26.827
[gasping]

09:28.829 --> 09:30.700
[gasps]

09:30.700 --> 09:32.397
HANDS IN THE AIR,
OR I'LL SHOOT YOU IN THE HEAD.

09:32.397 --> 09:34.574
HEY, MAN, DON'T SHOOT.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.445
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
YOUR LIFE'S IN DANGER.

09:36.445 --> 09:37.881
WE CAME TO OFFER
POLICE PROTECTION.

09:37.881 --> 09:39.404
WHAT?

09:39.404 --> 09:41.319
YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.364
IT IS?

09:44.105 --> 09:46.934
YOU'RE NOT HERE ABOUT
THE METH... OTHER THING?

09:46.934 --> 09:48.457
THE MEH... OTHER THING?

09:50.024 --> 09:51.895
THERE IS NO OTHER THING.

09:51.895 --> 09:53.070
SLIP OF THE TONGUE.

09:53.070 --> 09:55.377
GET OUT OF THE POOL.

09:57.118 --> 09:59.120
[phone ringing in distance]

09:59.120 --> 10:01.862
HEY, GRACE.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE PEAKED.

10:01.862 --> 10:03.472
I FOUND OUT
WHY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

10:03.472 --> 10:04.778
TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH HIGHTOWER.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.475
WHAT IS IT? TELL ME.

10:06.475 --> 10:08.129
I SPOKE TO HER AUNT,
AND SHE SAID

10:08.129 --> 10:10.522
HIGHTOWER AND THE KIDS
HAD AN ACCIDENT.

10:10.522 --> 10:11.785
THEY'RE DEAD.

10:11.785 --> 10:14.788
WHAT? WHEN?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.877
TWO WEEKS AGO ON VACATION
IN MEXICO.

10:16.877 --> 10:18.226
THEY DROWNED.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.445
HOW COME WE DIDN'T
HEAR ABOUT IT SOONER?

10:20.445 --> 10:21.882
IT'S VERY STRANGE.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.188
APPARENTLY, THEY NEVER
FOUND THE BODIES,

10:24.188 --> 10:26.887
AND AUTHORITIES HAVE CALLED OFF
THE SEARCH AND RESCUE.

10:26.887 --> 10:29.280
HMM.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.631
WH-WHAT DID YOU SAY
HER AUNT'S NAME WAS?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.111
RUBY. RUBY HIGHTOWER.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.636
YEAH, WELL, I-I'M GONNA
NEED AN ADDRESS.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.943
I NEED TO SEND HER SOME FLOWERS.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.945
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

10:41.945 --> 10:44.469
[line ringing]This is Bob Kirkland.

10:44.469 --> 10:47.995
KIRKLAND. THIS IS
AGENT REEDE SMITH, F.B.I.

10:47.995 --> 10:49.561
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
SMITH?

10:49.561 --> 10:51.346
I think it's what I can do
for you.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.914
MY SUPERIORS ASKED
THAT I FILL YOU IN

10:53.914 --> 10:55.480
ON A CASE I'M WORKING.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.395
IT INVOLVES PATRICK JANE.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.310
I'M LISTENING.

10:59.310 --> 11:00.964
It's a murder/kidnapping thing.

11:00.964 --> 11:02.618
Vic's a guy named
Benjamin Marx.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.098
Jane dealt with him before.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.448
USED SOME...
SHALL WE SAY,

11:06.448 --> 11:09.625
OVER-THE-TOP TECHNIQUES
TO GET MARX TO CONFESS?

11:09.625 --> 11:11.409
THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

11:11.409 --> 11:13.934
Marx was on trial,
could have gone free.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.414
FRANKLY, I LIKE JANE FOR IT.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.199
HE'S GOT A VIGILANTE BEEF
WITH RED JOHN.

11:18.199 --> 11:19.896
MAYBE THIS IS HIS THING.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.551
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE
ON TO SOMETHING.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.205
NICE WORK.Thanks.

11:24.205 --> 11:26.947
AND, SMITH?
KEEP ME IN THE LOOP.

11:26.947 --> 11:28.470
YES, SIR.

11:31.516 --> 11:34.955
[doorbell rings]

11:34.955 --> 11:36.913
[door opens]

11:36.913 --> 11:38.219
YES?

11:38.219 --> 11:40.090
MRS. HIGHTOWER?

11:40.090 --> 11:42.005
I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.094
I USED TO WORK WITH
YOUR NIECE MADELEINE,

11:44.094 --> 11:47.881
AND, UH, WELL, I WAS HOPING
THAT MAYBE WE COULD TALK.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.317
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.580
OH, PLEASE COME IN.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.675
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW YOUR NIECE?

11:59.675 --> 12:03.070
A FEW WEEKS AGO, RIGHT BEFORE
THEY WENT ON VACATION.

12:03.070 --> 12:06.682
THEY MADE A POINT
TO COME AND SEE ME.

12:06.682 --> 12:09.903
AT LEAST I GOT A CHANCE
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.906
YEAH, WELL, THERE--
THERE'S THAT.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.910
[inhales and exhales sharply]

12:16.910 --> 12:18.259
WHAT IS IT?

12:18.259 --> 12:21.305
OH, IT'S JUST, UH...

12:21.305 --> 12:24.918
[inhales and exhales]

12:24.918 --> 12:28.182
I JUST WISH THAT THERE WAS
SOME WAY I COULD...

12:28.182 --> 12:31.359
[sighs] LET HER KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

12:31.359 --> 12:33.187
THERE IS.

12:33.187 --> 12:35.624
MY NEIGHBOR IS VERY GOOD
WITH THE COMPUTER.

12:35.624 --> 12:38.105
HE SET UP A PRIVATE
MEMORIAL SITE

12:38.105 --> 12:39.628
ON THE INTERNET

12:39.628 --> 12:41.456
JUST FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

12:41.456 --> 12:43.501
I'D LOVE TO SEE THAT.

12:43.501 --> 12:46.374
[clicking mouse]

12:46.374 --> 12:47.854
OKAY, HERE YOU GO.

12:47.854 --> 12:49.638
OH, D-DO YOU MIND?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.466
I'M NOT VERY GOOD
WITH COMPUTERS.

12:51.466 --> 12:54.512
SURE. JUST SAY
WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY.

12:54.512 --> 12:57.211
WRITE THIS.

12:57.211 --> 12:59.909
IN DEATH...

12:59.909 --> 13:02.085
YOU HAVE FOUND NEW LIFE...

13:03.783 --> 13:06.089
AND I WANT TO SHOUT IT
FROM THE MOUNTAINTOPS.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.396
[continues typing]

13:08.396 --> 13:12.617
[voice breaking]
I KNOW IN MY HEART,

13:12.617 --> 13:15.490
DEAREST MADELEINE...

13:15.490 --> 13:18.406
THAT WHEN SUNSET COMES,

13:18.406 --> 13:20.408
I WILL FIND YOU
WAITING FOR ME...

13:20.408 --> 13:23.367
[typing continues]IN THE HEAVENLY GARDENS.

13:25.326 --> 13:26.457
LOVE, PATRICK.

13:26.457 --> 13:28.982
[sighs]

13:28.982 --> 13:31.636
OH... THAT WAS, UM...

13:31.636 --> 13:33.160
THAT'S LOVELY.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.465
[hits key]

13:34.465 --> 13:36.467
VERY POETICAL.

13:36.467 --> 13:40.210
THANK YOU.
FEELS A LOT BETTER.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.995
[breathes deeply]
I SHOULD--I SHOULD GO.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.345
OR, YOU POOR LAMB.

13:44.345 --> 13:47.043
YOU WERE A LITTLE SWEET
ON HER, WEREN'T YOU?

14:03.016 --> 14:06.497
[lullaby music playing]

14:06.497 --> 14:07.977
OH...

14:10.458 --> 14:12.416
[knock on door]

14:14.157 --> 14:15.767
[sighs]

14:18.205 --> 14:19.989
[knock on door]

14:25.212 --> 14:26.996
[knock on door]

14:31.044 --> 14:32.306
NO.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.656
I REMEMBER YOU.
TALK TO MY LAWYER.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.266
MR. HAIBACH.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.268
[sighs]IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
JUST HEAR ME OUT.

14:40.183 --> 14:42.620
I THINK YOU'VE WANTED TO PIN
SOMETHING ON ME FOR A LONG TIME.

14:42.620 --> 14:44.579
I WON'T BE YOUR PATSY,
MS. LISBON.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.407
IT'S AGENT LISBON.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.539
AND WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
THAT YOUR LIFE IS IN DANGER.

14:48.539 --> 14:50.585
I AM HERE TO OFFER YOU
POLICE PROTECTION.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.283
SO IF I GO WITH YOU,
NOTHING BAD WILL HAPPEN TO ME?

14:53.283 --> 14:56.591
SOUNDS LIKE POLICE STATE
TRICKERY, AGENTLISBON.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.245
THE STASI WOULD BE PROUD.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.465
I AM LEGALLY AND MORALLY
BOUND TO INFORM YOU THAT--

15:01.465 --> 15:03.598
PLEASE DON'T TRY TO STAKE OUT
THE MORAL HIGH GROUND HERE.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.295
IF YOU HAD YOUR WAY,
I'D BE IN JAIL

15:05.295 --> 15:06.601
FOR A CRIME I DIDN'T COMMIT.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.604
I THINK I'LL TAKE
MY CHANCES.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.388
[Lisbon] How's it going, Jane?

15:11.388 --> 15:13.608
I JUST VISITED
WITH HIGHTOWER'S AUNT.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.175
That's so sad.

15:15.175 --> 15:17.003
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT?

15:17.003 --> 15:18.395
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK RED JOHN
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.529
I DON'T THINK SO.
NOT HIS M.O.

15:21.529 --> 15:23.139
SO YOU THINK IT'S JUST
AN ACCIDENT?

15:23.139 --> 15:25.794
LOOKS LIKE IT.
HOW'S THE ROUNDUP GOING?

15:25.794 --> 15:29.972
HAIBACH WOULDN'T COME WITH ME.
I THINK HE'S HIDING SOMETHING.

15:29.972 --> 15:31.713
WELL, A GUY LIKE THAT
PROBABLY TAKES ISSUE

15:31.713 --> 15:33.280
WITH LADY POLICE.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.151
Ladies in general.

15:35.151 --> 15:37.849
UH, YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'LL SEND CHO AND RIGSBY.

15:37.849 --> 15:39.634
OR NOT.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.723
WOULD THE WORLD REALLY MISS HIM
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED?

15:41.723 --> 15:43.855
AND THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

15:43.855 --> 15:45.553
And good-bye.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.687
[knock on door]

15:52.255 --> 15:53.778
IF YOU ARE FROM CBI,
I'M--

15:53.778 --> 15:55.084
[crackles]UHH!

15:56.912 --> 15:58.131
[head thuds]

16:00.437 --> 16:01.786
[door creaks]

16:17.019 --> 16:19.108
[engine stops]

16:19.108 --> 16:20.762
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:20.762 --> 16:22.155
WE FOUND THE DOOR OPEN,

16:22.155 --> 16:23.634
BLOOD AND BEER BOTTLE
ON THE FLOOR.

16:23.634 --> 16:25.636
NO HAIBACH. RIGSBY'S
CANVASSING THE NEIGHBORS.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.381
THIS IS BAD.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.864
NOT REALLY.

16:35.864 --> 16:38.040
CONFIRMS THE THEORY THAT SOMEONE
IS GOING THROUGH MY LIST

16:38.040 --> 16:39.476
TRYING TO FIND RED JOHN.

16:39.476 --> 16:40.912
HAIBACH HAS BEEN ABDUCTED,

16:40.912 --> 16:42.479
AND HE'S PROBABLY GONNA BE
TORTURED TO DEATH.

16:42.479 --> 16:44.264
YEAH, HE'S
IN FOR A ROUGH NIGHT.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.309
AND WE HAVE TO TELL SMITH
AND THE F.B.I.

16:46.309 --> 16:49.312
THAT HE'S BEEN TAKEN AND THAT
IT'S CONNECTED TO THE MARX CASE.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.488
NO, WE DON'T.WE CAN'T LIE.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.621
WE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

16:53.621 --> 16:54.926
HE'S GONNA PUT IT TOGETHER
EVENTUALLY,

16:54.926 --> 16:56.406
AND IT'LL BE WORSE.

16:56.406 --> 16:58.104
OKAY, FINE. TELL HIM.

16:58.104 --> 16:59.583
BUT DO NOT MENTION
THE LIST.

16:59.583 --> 17:01.237
JUST TELL HIM
THAT SOMEONE ELSE

17:01.237 --> 17:02.717
CONNECTED TO AN OLD CASE
OF OURS HAS GONE MISSING.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.327
AGREED.

17:04.327 --> 17:05.633
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?

17:07.113 --> 17:09.115
I WILL HAVE THE ANSWER
FOR THAT VERY SOON.

17:17.253 --> 17:19.864
I HAVE BLACK, MILK...

17:19.864 --> 17:21.605
AND MILK AND SUGAR.

17:21.605 --> 17:23.520
I'LL TAKE WHATEVER
YOU DON'T WANT.

17:23.520 --> 17:24.826
YOU ALWAYS THIS THOROUGH?

17:24.826 --> 17:26.784
I LIKE TO COVER
ALL MY BASES.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.830
[chuckles] MILK AND SUGAR.

17:30.832 --> 17:32.312
THANKS.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.665
SO YOU SAID YOU GOT
SOMETHING FOR ME?

17:37.665 --> 17:39.101
[clears throat]

17:39.101 --> 17:40.929
THERE'S BEEN AN INTERESTING
DEVELOPMENT

17:40.929 --> 17:43.714
IN THAT CASE I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

17:43.714 --> 17:46.152
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER MAN'S
GONE MISSING

17:46.152 --> 17:47.631
THAT'S CONNECTED WITH JANE.

17:47.631 --> 17:50.243
A, UH, RICHARD HAIBACH.

17:50.243 --> 17:52.375
THAT IS INTERESTING.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.334
THANK YOU.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.728
LOOK, IT'S NONE
OF MY BUSINESS, BUT, UH...

17:57.728 --> 17:59.687
CAN I ASK WHAT THE DEAL IS
WITH YOU AND JANE?

17:59.687 --> 18:02.124
LONG STORY.

18:02.124 --> 18:03.734
WHATEVER.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.867
I'M NOT LOOKING TO PRY.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.566
I LIKE THAT.

18:09.566 --> 18:13.396
[clicks tongue] I'VE DONE
SOME RESEARCH ON YOU.

18:13.396 --> 18:14.571
ON ME?

18:14.571 --> 18:16.573
YEAH. YOU'RE A GOOD AGENT.

18:16.573 --> 18:18.184
REAL STRAIGHT SHOOTER.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.838
WHY WOULD YOU RESEARCH ME?

18:23.493 --> 18:27.758
I HAVE SOME OTHER BUSINESS
I WANT TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.412
DELICATE BUSINESS.

18:31.240 --> 18:34.156
OKAY. SHOOT.

18:34.156 --> 18:36.506
TIGER TIGER.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.424
HUH?

18:41.424 --> 18:43.600
TIGER TIGER.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.385
WHAT, ARE YOU MESSING
WITH ME?

18:45.385 --> 18:46.908
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?
"TIGER TIGER"?

18:46.908 --> 18:50.216
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.869
KNOW WHAT?

18:53.654 --> 18:56.222
NOTHING. THAT'S A TEST.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.659
OKAY.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.009

WELL, I GUESS THERE'S
NO REASON NOT TO TELL YOU NOW.

HEAR THIS FROM ME.

22:12.940 --> 22:16.160
[indistinct conversations]

22:17.640 --> 22:20.556
WHEN MINNELLI WAS CHIEF
OF THE CBI,

22:20.556 --> 22:22.993
HE STRUCK A DEAL WITH F.B.I.
DIRECTOR SCHULTZ.

22:22.993 --> 22:24.125
WHAT DID SCHULTZ WANT?

22:24.125 --> 22:26.475
SHE WANTED REPORTS.

ON YOU.

22:27.911 --> 22:31.001
MINNELLI PROVIDED THEM.

WHEN MINNELLI RETIRED,
THAT BECAME A PART OF MY JOB.

GOING TO THE F.B.I.

I DID WHAT I THOUGHT
WAS BEST AT THE TIME.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.346
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.609
OKAY, SO WE--WE BOTH HAVE
DIFFERENT APPROACHES,

30:28.609 --> 30:31.873
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING HERE
IS THAT WE SHARE A COMMON GOAL.

30:31.873 --> 30:33.570
WE CAN HELP EACH OTHER
IF WE WORK TOGETHER.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.921
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN WORKING TOGETHER,

30:35.921 --> 30:39.620
AND I DOUBT YOU ARE,
EITHER.

30:39.620 --> 30:41.535
WE BOTH WANT OUR REVENGE,

30:41.535 --> 30:44.451
AND ONLY ONE OF US
IS GOING TO GET IT.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.457
ROBERT KIRKLAND.

30:50.457 --> 30:53.199
[exhales]I KNOW I SHOULD BE
SURPRISED, BUT--

30:53.199 --> 30:55.157
BUT HE'S A CREEPY GUY,
THAT'S WHY.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.593
WHERE WOULD HE TAKE JANE?

30:56.593 --> 30:59.248
PROBABLY THE SAME PLACE
HE TOOK BENJAMIN MARX.

30:59.248 --> 31:01.990
JANE SAW A PINE NEEDLE
IN MARX'S SHOE.

31:01.990 --> 31:03.426
IT WAS LIKE HE'D WALKED
THROUGH A PINE FOREST

31:03.426 --> 31:04.950
BEFORE HE WAS KILLED.

31:04.950 --> 31:07.300
LOTS OF PINE NEEDLES
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.997
KIRKLAND WOULD BE
KEEPING UP APPEARANCES.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.608
HE'D BE GOING TO THE OFFICE
EVERY DAY, SO...

31:11.608 --> 31:13.088
PINE FOREST WITHIN
A HUNDRED-MILE RADIUS

31:13.088 --> 31:14.307
OF SACRAMENTO?

31:14.307 --> 31:16.439
SURE, SURE.
IF THAT'S ALL WE GOT.

31:16.439 --> 31:19.399
[dials, line rings]

31:19.399 --> 31:20.835
[Van Pelt] Hey, boss.

31:20.835 --> 31:23.055
VAN PELT, I NEED YOU
TO RUN SOMETHING FOR ME.

31:23.055 --> 31:25.492
PROPERTIES OR BUSINESSES
OWNED BY ROBERT KIRKLAND

31:25.492 --> 31:27.276
within 100 miles
of the Capitol...[typing]

31:27.276 --> 31:28.930
in close proximity
to a pine forest.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.105
ROBERT KIRKLAND?

31:30.105 --> 31:32.281
IT'S A LONG STORY.

31:32.281 --> 31:35.067
NOTHING FOR ROBERT KIRKLAND
WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES.

31:35.067 --> 31:37.330
[typing]Ah, crap.

31:37.330 --> 31:39.245
BUT THERE'S
A MICHAEL KIRKLAND.

31:39.245 --> 31:42.117
OWNS A CABIN UP NEAR
EL DORADO STATE PARK.

31:42.117 --> 31:43.336
OH, IS HE A RELATIVE?

31:43.336 --> 31:44.772
I DON'T KNOW.
I CAN CHECK.

31:44.772 --> 31:46.295
ALL RIGHT, TEXT ME
THE ADDRESS.

31:46.295 --> 31:47.731
Sure.

31:47.731 --> 31:48.994
WE SHOULD CALL LOCAL
AUTHORITIES FOR BACKUP.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.039
NO. NO. NO COPS.

31:51.039 --> 31:52.649
NOBODY CAN KNOW ABOUT ME.
PLEASE.

31:52.649 --> 31:55.174
OKAY.

31:55.174 --> 31:56.653
HOW DO WE DO THIS?

31:56.653 --> 31:58.917
[exhales]

31:58.917 --> 31:59.918
[clicks]

32:06.098 --> 32:07.795
THAT'S HOW.

32:09.840 --> 32:12.278
DO YOU HAVE SIBLINGS, JANE?

32:12.278 --> 32:14.889
NO.

32:16.238 --> 32:19.415
I HAD A TWIN BROTHER--
MICHAEL.

32:19.415 --> 32:21.287
WE WERE VERY CLOSE
GROWING UP.

32:21.287 --> 32:23.332
I HEAR
THAT'S A STRONG BOND.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.684
AND OUR FATHER WAS
A SADISTIC DRUNK.

32:27.684 --> 32:29.208
HE BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF US

32:29.208 --> 32:31.514
AND OUR MOTHER.

32:31.514 --> 32:33.516
BEAT HER TILL SHE COULDN'T
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

32:33.516 --> 32:36.041
SHE LEFT?WITH A RAZOR BLADE.

32:37.477 --> 32:39.653
AFTER THAT,

32:39.653 --> 32:41.872
IT WAS JUST ME AND MICHAEL.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.831
I WAS ALL HE HAD.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.354
YOU WERE THE STRONGER ONE.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.877
YEAH.

32:46.877 --> 32:48.749
UH, I GREW UP.
I GOT AWAY.

32:48.749 --> 32:50.098
BUT MICHAEL COULDN'T DO IT.

32:50.098 --> 32:53.319
[inhales] HE STAYED
IN THIS HOUSE

32:53.319 --> 32:56.844
AND WATCHED OUR FATHER
DRINK HIMSELF TO DEATH.

32:56.844 --> 32:59.368
THE APPLE DOESN'T FALL
FAR FROM THE TREE.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.066
YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:01.066 --> 33:02.719
MICHAEL TURNED TO THE BOTTLE,

33:02.719 --> 33:06.723
DRANK LIKE HIS LIFE
DEPENDED ON IT.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.595
I PAID FOR TREATMENTS.

33:08.595 --> 33:10.945
I TOOK HIM TO MEETINGS.

33:10.945 --> 33:12.425
NOTHING WORKED.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.209
UNTIL?

33:14.209 --> 33:16.646
UNTIL ONE DAY HE MET SOMEONE,

33:16.646 --> 33:18.431
A MAN WHO COULD HELP HIM.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.433
MORE THAN A MAN.
A SAVIOR.

33:20.433 --> 33:24.219
YEAH. RED JOHN.

33:24.219 --> 33:27.570
HE ONLY ASKED FOR A FEW
SIMPLE THINGS IN RETURN.

33:27.570 --> 33:30.878
DEVOTION AND SACRIFICE.

33:30.878 --> 33:33.402
MICHAEL DRIFTED
FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY

33:33.402 --> 33:35.448
UNTIL ONE DAY
HE WAS GONE.

33:35.448 --> 33:37.624
I NEVER SAW HIM AGAIN.

33:37.624 --> 33:40.018
YOU THINK RED JOHN
KILLED YOUR BROTHER.

33:41.367 --> 33:43.108
YES.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.023
I NEVER FOUND HIM,

33:45.023 --> 33:48.635
BUT IN MY HEART,
I KNOW.

33:50.115 --> 33:53.161
[inhales and exhales]

33:53.161 --> 33:55.207
LOOK AT ME BLAB.

33:55.207 --> 33:57.644
I-I... YOU'RE NOT
MY THERAPIST.

33:57.644 --> 34:01.126
I DIDN'T BRING YOU HERE
TO TALK.

34:01.126 --> 34:03.780
PLEASE TELL ME
WHO THE SUSPECTS ARE.

34:05.217 --> 34:08.307
NO.

34:08.307 --> 34:10.309
[sighs]

34:10.309 --> 34:12.050
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

34:18.665 --> 34:21.320
YOU UNDERSTAND, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO TORTURE YOU.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.378
YOU DON'T SEEM LIKE SOMEONE

34:36.378 --> 34:38.467
WHO DEALS WELL
WITH PHYSICAL PAIN.

34:38.467 --> 34:40.382
UH, NOT PARTICULARLY.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.645
A NAME THEN.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.517
I CAN'T DO IT.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.128
FINE.

34:52.002 --> 34:55.484
[whimpering and panting]

34:55.484 --> 34:56.746

[muffled sobbing]

35:02.491 --> 35:03.797
[muffled screaming]OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.060
[muffled sobbing]

35:06.060 --> 35:08.628
YOU... YOU--YOU HAVE
TO UNDERSTAND,

35:08.628 --> 35:10.630
THIS IS HARD FOR ME...

35:10.630 --> 35:12.980
EMOTIONALLY.

35:12.980 --> 35:16.288
I'VE NEVER SAID ANY OF THESE
NAMES OUT LOUD TO ANYONE.

35:16.288 --> 35:18.942
A NAME.

35:18.942 --> 35:20.683

35:20.683 --> 35:23.512

35:33.653 --> 35:35.089

35:38.832 --> 35:39.963
JANE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

35:39.963 --> 35:42.662
OH, NEVER BETTER.

35:42.662 --> 35:43.880
I'M JUST FINE. DANDY.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.491
OOH! THANKS TO US.

35:45.491 --> 35:48.363

36:00.984 --> 36:02.856
YOU ARE A PAIN IN THE ASS.

36:02.856 --> 36:04.727
WELL, THANK YOU.

36:04.727 --> 36:06.729
BUT I WOULDN'T WANT ANYTHING
BAD TO HAPPEN TO YOU,

36:06.729 --> 36:10.255
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WOULD BE
MY FAULT.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.387
WELL, I'M SURE YOUR CONSCIENCE
IS CLEAR NOW.

36:12.387 --> 36:15.085
IT IS. NOW LEAVE ME ALONE.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.565
NEXT TIME I HEAR FROM YOU,

36:16.565 --> 36:18.480
YOU BETTER BE TELLING ME
RED JOHN IS DEAD.

36:18.480 --> 36:21.004

37:07.007 --> 37:09.401
THAT IS
A VERY MANAGEABLE NUMBER.

37:09.401 --> 37:11.707
SOMEHOW THAT DOESN'T
REASSURE ME.

37:13.492 --> 37:16.190
WE'RE IN THE HOME STRETCH,
