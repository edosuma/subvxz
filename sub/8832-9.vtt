06:45.900 --> 06:46.733
>> YEAH.

06:46.733 --> 06:49.167
JOE, GO KISS THE GIRL IN PURPLE.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.200
>> OH, BOY.

06:50.200 --> 06:51.067
>> OHH.

06:51.067 --> 06:51.800
>> JOE.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.967
>> LOOK HOW RED HIS FACE IS.

06:53.967 --> 06:56.133
>> WHY IS YOUR LIP SWEATING?

06:57.233 --> 06:58.433
>> BECAUSE...

06:58.433 --> 07:00.267
>> LOOK HOW RED HE IS!

07:00.267 --> 07:01.100
>> All: OH, MY GOD!

07:01.100 --> 07:02.233
>> IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR HEAD'S

07:02.233 --> 07:03.233
GONNA POP OFF YOUR BODY.

07:03.233 --> 07:04.367
>> I'VE NEVER SEEN JOE LIKE

07:04.367 --> 07:04.700
THIS.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.967
>> OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW THIS IS A

07:05.967 --> 07:06.267
GAME.

07:06.267 --> 07:07.100
I HAVE TO KISS HER.

07:07.100 --> 07:07.867
IT MEANS NOTHING.

07:07.867 --> 07:09.100
>> YOU CAN KISS HER IF YOU WANT

07:09.100 --> 07:10.300
TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH TONIGHT.

07:11.367 --> 07:12.400
>> MAN!

07:12.400 --> 07:14.933
>> OHH, DON'T DO IT, JOE.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.300
>> THIS IS JUST A GAME.

07:16.300 --> 07:17.900
IT'S JUST A -- IT'S A QUICK

07:17.900 --> 07:18.533
SMOOCH.

07:18.533 --> 07:20.367
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO LOSE WITH

07:20.367 --> 07:21.067
THIS ONE.

07:21.067 --> 07:22.600
>> YOU'RE GONNA LOSE EVEN

07:22.600 --> 07:23.167
BIGGER.

07:28.400 --> 07:30.067
>> HERE COMES THE PLANE FOR THE

07:30.067 --> 07:32.633
LANDING.

07:32.633 --> 07:33.467
>> MWAH! NO!

07:33.467 --> 07:35.233
I CAN'T DO IT! I CAN'T DO IT!

07:35.233 --> 07:36.933
I CAN'T DO IT! I CAN'T DO IT!

07:37.967 --> 07:40.167
>>  YOU GUYS.

07:41.633 --> 07:42.867
>> Narrator: SAL AND JOE

07:42.867 --> 07:44.300
COULDN'T SEAL THIS CHALLENGE

07:44.300 --> 07:45.833
WITH A KISS, SO THEY'LL HAVE TO

07:45.833 --> 07:47.300
PUCKER UP ON THE LOSER BOARD.

07:47.300 --> 07:47.867
>> ACTION.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.067
>> All: ONE MISSISSIPPI.

07:49.067 --> 07:50.433
>> TODAY WE'LL BE ATTEMPTING TO

07:50.433 --> 07:51.867
GET OUR LIFE STORIES MADE INTO A

07:51.867 --> 07:52.267
MOVIE.

07:52.267 --> 07:53.600
>> SO WE'LL BE PRESENTING THE

07:53.600 --> 07:54.967
DETAILS OF OUR LIVES TO PEOPLE

07:54.967 --> 07:55.600
FOR REVIEW.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.933
>> BUT THESE DETAILS HAVE BEEN

07:56.933 --> 07:58.133
CREATED BY THE OTHER GUYS.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.133
>> AT THEN END OF THE

07:59.133 --> 08:00.533
PRESENTATION, WE'LL ASK ON A

08:00.533 --> 08:01.900
SCALE FROM ONE TO 10 HOW LIKELY

08:01.900 --> 08:03.133
THEY'D BE TO SEE THE FILM.

08:03.133 --> 08:04.533
>> WHOEVER GETS THE LOWEST SCORE

08:04.533 --> 08:04.967
LOSES.

08:04.967 --> 08:06.100
>> All: ONE MISSISSIPPI.

08:06.100 --> 08:07.467
CUT!

08:11.233 --> 08:12.767
>> I AM MAKING A BIOPIC PICTURE

08:12.767 --> 08:13.800
ABOUT MY LIFE STORY.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.067
SO WE'RE BASICALLY FOCUS

08:15.067 --> 08:15.733
GROUPING IT.

08:15.733 --> 08:17.233
AT THE END OF IT, I'LL ASK YOUR

08:17.233 --> 08:18.233
OPINION.

08:18.267 --> 08:18.633
OKAY?

08:18.633 --> 08:19.233
>> TERRIFIC.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.067
>> HERE WE GO --

08:20.067 --> 08:21.067
"THE LIFE OF JOE GATTO."

08:21.067 --> 08:21.533
THAT'S ME.

08:21.533 --> 08:22.700
LET'S DIVE IN.

08:28.067 --> 08:31.833
THAT WAS, UH...

08:31.833 --> 08:33.733
I WAS OF COURSE A C-SECTION.

08:33.733 --> 08:34.533
>> YEAH.

08:34.533 --> 08:36.100
>> THAT'S A D-SECTION!

08:37.100 --> 08:40.400
>> NEXT, I WAS BORN 13 MONTHS

08:40.400 --> 08:41.967
LATE, SO...

08:41.967 --> 08:44.633
>> WHAT?

08:46.800 --> 08:48.433
>> THE GESTATION PERIOD FOR MY

08:48.433 --> 08:50.167
MOTHER WAS A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

08:52.767 --> 08:53.433
22 MONTH, YEAH.

08:53.433 --> 08:54.500
THAT'S THE MATH ON THAT --

08:54.500 --> 08:56.533
22 MONTHS.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.300
IT'S A MEDICAL ANOMALY.

09:01.300 --> 09:02.567
IT'S GOOD. IT'S GOOD TO HAVE A

09:02.567 --> 09:03.900
HUMOR ABOUT IT.

09:03.933 --> 09:05.133
BUT THERE ARE THINGS I'M

09:05.133 --> 09:06.067
SENSITIVE ABOUT.

09:06.067 --> 09:07.167
>> HERE WE GO. HERE WE GO.

09:07.167 --> 09:07.833
HERE WE GO.

09:09.767 --> 09:11.833
>> MY GIANT FORESKIN.

09:20.233 --> 09:23.067
THIS IS ME.

09:26.367 --> 09:27.433
I LOVE TO SWIM.

09:27.433 --> 09:28.800
THIS IS MY SWIMMING.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.767
IT'S A PARTY.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.500
I'M THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.

09:33.267 --> 09:36.733
IT'S THE ONLY SPORT I ENJOY.

09:36.733 --> 09:38.667
SO, THAT IS THE STORY OF ME AND

09:38.667 --> 09:39.333
MY LIFE.

09:39.333 --> 09:41.100
ON A SCALE OF ONE TO 10, HOW

09:41.100 --> 09:42.867
LIKELY WOULD YOU BE TO BUY A

09:42.867 --> 09:44.600
MOVIE TICKET TO THIS MOVIE.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.467
>> I SAY ONE.

09:45.467 --> 09:46.433
>> YOU SAY ONE?

09:46.433 --> 09:48.400
>> YEAH.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.667
>> ONE AND 7, SO WHAT IS THAT?

09:49.667 --> 09:50.800
WHAT'S THAT BOIL DOWN TO?

09:50.800 --> 09:51.567
>> 4. SO IT'S 4.

09:51.567 --> 09:52.200
>> SO IT'S 4.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.300
>> SO, THANK YOU SO MUCH,

09:53.300 --> 09:53.733
LADIES.

09:54.633 --> 09:55.600
>> OH, MY GOD.

09:55.633 --> 09:56.667
>> ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

09:56.667 --> 09:58.067
SO, WHY DON'T WE JUST GET

09:58.067 --> 10:00.200
STARTED?

10:00.200 --> 10:02.267
SINCE I WAS A TEEN, MY SENSE OF

10:02.267 --> 10:04.400
HUMOR HAS ALWAYS BE "OUT OF THIS

10:04.400 --> 10:05.100
WORLD."

10:05.100 --> 10:06.733
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

10:06.733 --> 10:07.933
FOR INSTANCE.

10:07.933 --> 10:09.700
HELLO,

10:09.700 --> 10:10.467
EARTHLINGS.

10:10.467 --> 10:12.000
I'M HERE INVADING YOUR EARTH

10:12.000 --> 10:12.600
CAMERA.

10:12.600 --> 10:14.367
PREPARE TO DIE AS WE ATTACK YOUR

10:14.367 --> 10:15.867
PLANET FROM MOON X, AND THE

10:15.867 --> 10:16.967
MUSIC HAS STOPPED.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.533
WHAT IS GOING ON OVER THERE?

10:18.533 --> 10:19.433
>> OH, MY GOD.

10:19.433 --> 10:20.067
>> WHAT?

10:23.167 --> 10:26.500
>> YOU DORK!

10:26.500 --> 10:27.800
>> I STILL WEAR THAT FEDORA.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.633
AND THEN...

10:31.667 --> 10:33.200
ALL RIGHT, MY TROUBLED TEEN

10:33.200 --> 10:36.900
YEARS.

10:36.900 --> 10:38.533
>> WHAT'S THAT MEAN

10:38.533 --> 10:39.833
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

10:40.633 --> 10:42.200
>> WHAT DOES CLUNT BABY MEAN?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.767
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I CAME HOME

10:43.767 --> 10:45.267
ONE DAY, AND MY MOM WAS LIKE,

10:45.267 --> 10:46.567
"WHAT'S UP, CLUNT BABY?"

10:46.567 --> 10:47.600
AND IT JUST STUCK.

10:47.600 --> 10:50.700
>>

10:54.133 --> 10:55.667
>> EXPLAIN IT, Q. EXPLAIN IT.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.233
>> THIS IS WHAT A SLUMP BUSTER

10:57.233 --> 10:57.567
IS.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.967
UM, DO YOU KNOW HOW, LIKE,

10:58.967 --> 11:00.500
SOMETIMES YOU GO THROUGH DRY

11:00.500 --> 11:02.133
SPELLS IN YOUR PERSONAL LIFE AND

11:02.133 --> 11:03.700
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN INTIMATE IN A

11:03.700 --> 11:04.233
WHILE?

11:04.233 --> 11:04.733
>> OOH.

11:04.733 --> 11:06.400
>> AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, I GOT

11:06.400 --> 11:07.900

11:07.900 --> 11:09.200
JUST GO OUT AND YOU FIND

11:09.200 --> 11:09.733
ANYBODY.

11:09.733 --> 11:11.367
YOU LOWER YOUR STANDARDS TO THE

11:11.367 --> 11:13.067
BOTTOM AND YOU GET SOMEONE THAT

11:13.067 --> 11:14.267
YOU CALL A SLUMP BUSTER.

11:14.267 --> 11:15.167
THAT'S MY ZONE.

11:15.167 --> 11:16.333
I'M THE SLUMP BUSTER.

11:18.767 --> 11:20.067
CLUNT BABY BUSTS SLUMPS.

11:20.067 --> 11:21.500
>> CLUNT BABY BUSTS SLUMPS.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.533
>> OH, I SPENT A SUMMER IN

11:48.767 --> 11:51.367

11:53.100 --> 11:55.233
ON A SCALE FROM ONE TO 10, HOW

11:55.233 --> 11:57.467
LIKELY DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE

11:57.467 --> 11:59.067

11:59.067 --> 11:59.833

11:59.833 --> 12:01.433

>> SO, HERE'S MY SISTER.

12:12.067 --> 12:14.067
SHE WAS A BIG INFLUENCE ON ME

12:14.067 --> 12:14.967
GROWING UP.

12:14.967 --> 12:16.133
AND THEN, UM...

12:20.733 --> 12:22.633
THAT'S MY SISTA.

12:25.433 --> 12:27.100
SHE'S MY HOME GIRL.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.367
>> OH, MAN. THAT IS ROUGH.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.533

12:32.533 --> 12:34.433
LEAKED, AND THIS IS THE INTRO TO

12:58.767 --> 13:00.067
THAT'S RIGHT BEFORE THE

13:00.067 --> 13:00.633
FOREPLAY.

13:00.633 --> 13:02.133
ALTHOUGH ONE COULD ARGUE THAT

13:02.133 --> 13:03.600
THAT WAS PART OF THE FOREPLAY.

13:06.367 --> 13:07.667
UH, THE LOVE INTEREST.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.500
THIS IS WHAT I CONSIDER THE REAL

13:09.500 --> 13:11.400
CRUX, THE MEAT OF MY LIFE STORY.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.267
>> YEAH.

13:37.367 --> 13:38.800

13:38.800 --> 13:41.233
>> I WOULD PROBABLY SAY ONE OR A

13:41.233 --> 13:41.733
2.

13:41.733 --> 13:42.533
>> OHH!

13:42.533 --> 13:44.167
>> SO, THE AVERAGE IS 5.

13:44.167 --> 13:45.133
>>

13:45.167 --> 13:46.733
>> SO, IT'S JUST SOME STUFF

13:46.733 --> 13:48.467
ABOUT MY LIFE STORY THAT MAYBE

13:48.467 --> 13:50.067
PART OF AN UPCOMING BIOPIC.

THIS IS BEFORE SHE MOVED TO THIS

14:01.733 --> 14:02.567
COUNTRY.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.900
MY MOM WAS STILL LIVING IN HER

14:04.900 --> 14:06.800
NATIVE LAND, YUGOSLAVIA.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.233
OKAY.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.967
MY DAD WAS AN ASTRONAUT.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.300
IT'S HOW THEY MET.

14:19.767 --> 14:20.900
