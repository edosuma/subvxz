WEBVTT

00:02.350 --> 00:04.221
Ah.

00:04.308 --> 00:06.180
Am I moving your stuff
to my place

00:06.267 --> 00:07.659
all alone
or are you gonna help me?

00:07.746 --> 00:09.966
I'm helpin'.
I'm packin' memories.

00:12.186 --> 00:13.361
You know I'm actually
five pounds lighter

00:13.448 --> 00:15.102
than I was in high school?

00:15.189 --> 00:17.408
Do you know that none
of your glasses actually match?

00:17.495 --> 00:20.281
I don't even know
how a person does that.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.500
Hey, same haircut, you ask?

00:22.587 --> 00:24.763
Same barber, I say.

00:26.983 --> 00:28.941
Well, I have plenty
of glassware at my place

00:29.029 --> 00:31.857
so we'll just donate
this stuff to goodwill.

00:31.944 --> 00:34.773
Whoa-whoa, hang on. You realize
some of those are collectables.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.037
Really? And which
is the higher ticket item?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.474
Bam-Bam or Mayor McCheese?

00:41.606 --> 00:42.564
McCheese, of course.

00:42.651 --> 00:43.695
I think that one's still good

00:43.782 --> 00:46.481
for one free refill.

00:46.568 --> 00:49.875
Alright, we'll keep this one
and the Sammy Sosa travel mug.

00:49.962 --> 00:50.920
And my cereal bowl.

00:51.007 --> 00:52.922
Holds the perfect serving size.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.576
Plus, you can wash a baby in it.

00:54.663 --> 00:55.620
Yeah.

00:57.274 --> 01:00.103
Don't worry, I already
packed your cereal bowl.

01:00.190 --> 01:02.279
Now what are we gonna do
with your TV?

01:02.366 --> 01:05.021
Well, you don't
have a TV in your bedroom.

01:05.108 --> 01:07.197
Nah, I don't really like
having a TV in the bedroom.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.242
You know who says that?

01:08.329 --> 01:09.417
People who have never had a TV

01:09.504 --> 01:11.897
in their bedroom.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.248
Or people who like
to read or talk.

01:14.335 --> 01:16.119
Fine, but while
you're reading or talking

01:16.206 --> 01:19.079
what am I supposed to do?

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
I don't know, diggin'
through your belly button

01:20.645 --> 01:23.953
seems to take up
a lot of your time.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.999
So, the only place to watch TV
will be downstairs in the lobby?

01:29.089 --> 01:31.961
In my house, we call
that the living room.

01:32.048 --> 01:33.615
Yeah, but your mom and your
sister are down there

01:33.702 --> 01:34.746
so I'll have to put on pants.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.052
If I'm gonna put on pants

01:36.139 --> 01:38.576
I might as well
go to the movies.

01:38.663 --> 01:41.579
Alright, you can put
the TV in the bedroom.

01:41.666 --> 01:43.320
But if I ever walk in
wearing a sexy nightie

01:43.407 --> 01:46.062
and you give me one of these
I'm snapping that finger off

01:46.149 --> 01:48.282
and any other body part
that looks like it.

01:51.459 --> 01:54.636
That means I can
screw up 11 times.

01:54.723 --> 01:56.681
♪ For the first time ♪

01:56.768 --> 02:00.207
♪ In my life ♪

02:00.294 --> 02:03.297
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:12.915 --> 02:14.786
[instrumental music]

02:17.528 --> 02:19.922
So, Molly's belongings
are precious gold

02:20.009 --> 02:23.186
but you gotta hide your
worthless crap in my garage?

02:23.273 --> 02:24.492
I'm not hiding it.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.494
I'll just wait
until we get a bigger place.

02:26.581 --> 02:29.845
Then I'll sneak it in
one box at a time.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.239
Wonderful.
Lies and deception.

02:32.326 --> 02:35.851
The mortar that holds
the bricks of love together.

02:35.938 --> 02:36.982
It worked for you and dad.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.028
Those were simpler times.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.858
What happened
to my air hockey game?

02:42.945 --> 02:45.252
You know, Mikey,
I'm not one to cast judgment

02:45.339 --> 02:47.689
on how other people choose
to live their lives--

02:47.776 --> 02:50.170
Here we go.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.260
But rushing to move in with this
woman is a horrible mistake

02:53.347 --> 02:55.305
that you'll regret
the rest of your life.

02:55.392 --> 02:59.135
Well, don't sugarcoat it, mom.
How do you really feel?

02:59.222 --> 03:01.268
Hey, what happened
to all my GI Joe stuff?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.444
In my day, we didn't
shack up with somebody

03:03.531 --> 03:06.229
until we had rings on our
fingers and rice in our hair.

03:07.709 --> 03:08.884
Listen, Molly
and I love each other

03:08.971 --> 03:10.233
and getting rid
of my apartment

03:10.320 --> 03:11.539
is a good way
for us to save money.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.584
Well, if you really
wanted to save money

03:13.671 --> 03:15.586
you never should have moved out
of this house.

03:15.673 --> 03:19.808
Yeah, but that would have ended
in a murder-suicide.

03:19.895 --> 03:20.896
Fine.

03:20.983 --> 03:21.984
But when she gets tired

03:22.071 --> 03:23.420
of peeling your dirty drawers

03:23.507 --> 03:25.857
off the floor,
you always got three hots

03:25.944 --> 03:28.773
and a cot here with me and Jim.

03:28.860 --> 03:32.081
And that's all the incentive
I need to make it work.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.126
Seriously, I can't find
my stretch Armstrong

03:34.214 --> 03:35.780
my baseball cards, nothing.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.479
Hey, I had a garage sale, okay?

03:38.566 --> 03:39.958
And you sold my stuff?

03:40.045 --> 03:42.396
Well, if you don't
sprinkle in a few toys

03:42.483 --> 03:45.007
it just looks like
a sad, old shut-in

03:45.094 --> 03:47.618
having a pre-death estate sale.

03:47.705 --> 03:48.706
Oh, man.

03:48.793 --> 03:49.751
And if the guy across

03:49.838 --> 03:51.187
the street ever asks

03:51.274 --> 03:54.234
you never wore
that orange swimsuit.

03:54.321 --> 03:56.975
I promised him,
no plums in the basket.

04:00.631 --> 04:03.939
Okay, I made room for some of
Mike's stuff in the hall closet.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.071
I'm gonna take these things
over to goodwill.

04:06.158 --> 04:08.422
Don't you dare.
Those are your dad's clothes.

04:08.509 --> 04:09.945
You can't give those away.

04:10.032 --> 04:13.557
Mom, he died 25 years ago
and this leisure suit

04:13.644 --> 04:16.604
passed away
ten years before that.

04:16.691 --> 04:18.823
I don't care.
You're not giving them away.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.871
Oh, it still smells like daddy.

04:22.958 --> 04:25.003
Hai Karate and hot sauce.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.357
It'll be so weird
having another man living here.

04:30.444 --> 04:31.793
By the way, I was wondering
if you guys could clear

04:31.880 --> 04:33.838
a little space
for him in the bathroom.

04:33.925 --> 04:37.277
Ooh, that big man
in our little bathroom?

04:37.364 --> 04:38.626
Yipes.

04:40.541 --> 04:42.673
Don't worry. All he's got
is a razor and a toothbrush

04:42.760 --> 04:45.154
and for some mysterious reason,
a shower cap.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.592
It's not about counter space.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.681
We're worried about the beating
that toilet's gonna take.

04:50.768 --> 04:53.031
Oh, mom.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.077
Why don't we make him use
the downstairs bathroom

04:55.164 --> 04:56.121
like we did with dad?

04:56.208 --> 04:57.427
Ah, there you go.

04:57.514 --> 04:58.472
Just throw in a good

04:58.559 --> 04:59.951
industrial-strength plunger

05:00.038 --> 05:01.605
and a big scented candle.

05:01.692 --> 05:04.129
Citronella, like they
use at campsites.

05:05.696 --> 05:07.437
Or we could just rent one
of those porta potties

05:07.524 --> 05:09.961
and put it in the backyard.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.529
Good idea, then it becomes
the neighbor's problem.

05:18.535 --> 05:20.145
Alright, this is the last of it.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.800
We got a dreamsicle
and what is either

05:22.887 --> 05:25.673
a frozen tamale
or a pair of yellow dress socks.

05:27.718 --> 05:30.547
I will have the dreamsicle.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.289
I'll spin the wheel
on that tamale.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.552
Good luck, 'cause
it was here when I moved in.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.687
So, what are you doing
with this sofa?

05:39.774 --> 05:40.992
I tried to give it
to goodwill, but apparently

05:41.079 --> 05:42.994
they have a too many
stains policy.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.868
I'm surprised
they took your shirts.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.173
Samuel, it's yours
if you want it.

05:48.260 --> 05:49.610
Uh, thank you

05:49.697 --> 05:51.394
but my roommates and I have more

05:51.481 --> 05:53.875
of a southwestern motif.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.835
You know, now that you're moving
in with Molly

05:57.922 --> 05:59.663
we won't be able to hang out
like this anymore.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.665
What are you talking about?
You guys can come over there.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.972
It's gonna be my place
as much as it is hers.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.843
Hmm, yeah, that's what
those Indians thought

06:05.930 --> 06:07.932
when they waved at that first
boatload of pilgrims.

06:11.196 --> 06:15.723
Exactly. No more spearing fish
and peeing in the woods.

06:15.810 --> 06:19.204
It's tea cakes
and Bible lessons for you.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.597
What the hell
are you talking about?

06:20.684 --> 06:22.382
Those women
are gonna civilize you.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.471
No more fingers up your nose,
no hands down your pants

06:24.558 --> 06:25.863
and forget about sitting
on the couch

06:25.950 --> 06:28.126
drinking from a can
of pork and beans.

06:28.213 --> 06:29.824
Please, Carl, I'm not an animal.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.348
- I've lived indoors before.
- 'Really?'

06:32.435 --> 06:33.871
You-you want to lift
these couch cushions

06:33.958 --> 06:35.873
and play food, filth or fungi?

06:38.006 --> 06:40.225
[microwave dings]

06:40.312 --> 06:43.098
- 'Tamale?'
- Frozen plantain.

06:43.185 --> 06:45.143
I'll eat that.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.584
See? Doesn't take
up a lot of space.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.499
And it fits in
with all your Asian decor.

06:52.586 --> 06:53.935
Samsung.

06:55.676 --> 06:58.896
Hilarious.
What are we gonna do with this?

06:58.983 --> 07:01.159
Good question, where do you
keep your bobbleheads?

07:01.246 --> 07:03.205
Well, I only have the one
and right now

07:03.292 --> 07:04.859
he's putting a TV in my bedroom.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.559
That's cute. At my place,
he sat next to my computer.

07:09.646 --> 07:12.780
Oh, well, here he'll live
in the garage.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.391
Do you like that?
Oh, he does like that.

07:16.653 --> 07:17.698
The garage?

07:17.785 --> 07:18.829
This guy is a hall of famer

07:18.916 --> 07:19.917
and won 20 games

07:20.004 --> 07:21.092
six years in a row.

07:21.179 --> 07:23.312
This is not the actual guy.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.142
Fine, sure seems like a lot
of my stuff's being

07:27.229 --> 07:28.839
relegated to the garage.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.929
Alright, I'll find
a place for this little fella.

07:32.016 --> 07:33.583
Great, and since
you're loosening the reins

07:33.670 --> 07:35.280
on the sports memorabilia

07:35.367 --> 07:38.022
let's find a spot
for this eBay treasure.

07:41.199 --> 07:43.898
Gosh, we're running tight
on wall space.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.422
Uh, what
about downstairs bathroom?

07:46.509 --> 07:48.293
Fergie Jenkins in the garage?

07:48.380 --> 07:49.817
Gale Sayers in the crapper?

07:51.558 --> 07:54.865
I don't think you're really
from Chicago, lady.

07:54.952 --> 07:57.694
Well, I know that this is tough,
but come here.

07:59.217 --> 08:01.045
But it's just temporary.

08:01.132 --> 08:03.091
Soon we'll have our own place
that's not mine

08:03.178 --> 08:05.093
not yours, but ours.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.181
I guess.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.574
And we'll have so much room

08:07.661 --> 08:09.314
you'll be able
to have your own den.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.533
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.013
You can put
all your stuff in there.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.841
- That'll be cool, right?
- Like a man cave.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.234
Exactly.

08:16.321 --> 08:18.149
Can I smoke cigars
in my man cave?

08:18.236 --> 08:20.282
I don't really see it
having a window.

08:24.025 --> 08:26.418
Wait, it's not gonna be
an actual cave, is it?

08:43.784 --> 08:45.699
Molly?

08:53.620 --> 08:55.273
Molly, I'm hungry.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.841
Well, go downstairs and fill up
your big cereal bowl.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.324
- By myself?
- Take your bobblehead.

09:05.806 --> 09:07.372
Mike, come on.

09:07.459 --> 09:09.897
Sunday's my only day
to sleep in.

09:09.984 --> 09:11.899
What if your mom and sister
are down there?

09:11.986 --> 09:14.162
You have eaten meals
with my family before.

09:14.249 --> 09:15.859
Yeah, but you're
always there with me.

09:15.946 --> 09:17.513
Sweetheart,
this is your house now.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.036
You can go do whatever you want.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.823
Well, what I want is for you
to come downstairs

09:22.910 --> 09:23.867
with me and have breakfast.

09:23.954 --> 09:26.696
- Go!
- Fine.

09:29.003 --> 09:31.005
You know, you're meaner now
that we live together.

09:35.183 --> 09:37.664
Whoa, there he is.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.668
Morning, Victoria.
You just getting home?

09:41.755 --> 09:43.931
Yeah, I had
a little car trouble.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.891
Maybe I can help,
I'm not a mechanic

09:47.978 --> 09:49.806
but I know
what's what under the hood.

09:49.893 --> 09:52.287
This is actually more
of a too stoned to remember

09:52.374 --> 09:53.984
where I parked problem.

09:56.465 --> 09:58.336
Well, as a sworn police officer

09:58.423 --> 10:00.556
I cannot comment,
but I commend you

10:00.643 --> 10:02.166
for not driving a motor vehicle

10:02.253 --> 10:03.428
while under the influence.

10:03.515 --> 10:05.648
Wasn't really my choice.

10:08.216 --> 10:12.742
But thank you
for not harshing my mellow.

10:12.829 --> 10:13.787
No problem.

10:13.874 --> 10:17.529
And for the record, Johnny Law.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.621
Pow, pow, pow.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.319
And I'm walking the line.

10:32.980 --> 10:34.198
Molly, you up yet? Aw!

10:34.285 --> 10:36.287
[Molly]
'Out!'

10:41.945 --> 10:45.079
Oh, look who's coming to
the kitchen in his jammie pants.

10:47.037 --> 10:47.995
Morning.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.039
Cop a squat

10:49.126 --> 10:50.824
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.869
Thank you.

10:52.956 --> 10:55.219
Listen, uh, Mrs. Flynn,
I really appreciate

10:55.306 --> 10:57.047
you letting me move in here.

10:57.134 --> 10:59.310
Oh, please, call me Joyce.

10:59.397 --> 11:00.660
And it really
wasn't my decision.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.620
- Cream and sugar?
- Black, please.

11:04.707 --> 11:05.882
You'll love it
with cream and sugar.

11:08.189 --> 11:10.060
That's the way
Molly's dad drank it.

11:10.147 --> 11:12.106
I don't really process
dairy well, but okay.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.068
And listen, if there's
anything you ever need done

11:18.155 --> 11:21.115
just let me know.
I wanna earn my keep.

11:21.202 --> 11:23.465
We're talking chores, right?

11:23.552 --> 11:26.468
Not some sort of
plus-sized gigolo action?

11:30.690 --> 11:32.692
No.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.432
I'm pulling your leg, hoss.

11:34.519 --> 11:36.652
Oh.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.262
If you're serious
about helping out

11:38.349 --> 11:39.524
a couple
of those kitchen cabinets

11:39.611 --> 11:41.048
could use new hinges.

11:41.135 --> 11:42.658
I'll take care of that today.

11:42.745 --> 11:44.878
We could also use a new screen
for the back door.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.184
Victoria walks through
at least one a year.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.538
Consider it done.

11:53.625 --> 11:54.931
And a new exhaust hose

11:55.018 --> 11:56.411
for the dryer.

11:56.498 --> 11:57.629
Easy to do.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.805
Oh, and the pulsating

11:58.892 --> 12:00.154
shower wand upstairs

12:00.241 --> 12:02.852
has seen better days.

12:02.939 --> 12:05.028
Three women in the house.
Don't ask.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.338
Wasn't planning on it.

12:12.340 --> 12:13.428
[thudding]

12:13.515 --> 12:15.343
What's that pounding?

12:15.430 --> 12:17.345
Oh, it's your boyfriend
is up on the roof

12:17.432 --> 12:20.043
replacing the loose shingles.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.306
Okay, so it wasn't Santa Claus.

12:24.091 --> 12:27.616
But you can understand
what got me there, right?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.009
The poor guy's
only been here one night

12:29.096 --> 12:30.053
and you're putting him to work?

12:30.140 --> 12:31.707
He volunteered.

12:31.794 --> 12:33.883
Mike Biggs volunteered
to climb up on the roof

12:33.970 --> 12:35.624
and start relaying shingles?

12:35.711 --> 12:38.975
He was reluctant at first, but
I promised him a pan of brownies

12:39.062 --> 12:41.325
and he shimmied up that ladder
like his ass was on fire.

12:43.414 --> 12:45.982
Mom, we shouldn't take advantage
of Mike's good nature.

12:46.069 --> 12:48.550
Some might say his jolly nature.

12:51.074 --> 12:53.685
You know,
he's been working hard.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.645
We should make him
a nice dinner tonight.

12:56.732 --> 12:58.516
That's a great idea.

12:58.603 --> 13:02.042
Remember our Sunday night
dinners with daddy?

13:02.129 --> 13:04.174
We'll make pot roast,
mashed potatoes

13:04.261 --> 13:05.262
and banana cream pie.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.524
Daddy's favorite.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.223
Oh, it-it's not Mike's favorite.

13:09.310 --> 13:11.791
Who the hell's
talking about Mike?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.446
I'm telling you, Carl,
all I did was put

13:15.533 --> 13:16.970
a couple screws
in a cabinet door

13:17.057 --> 13:20.016
and her mom made me
French toast.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.889
I know, I feel like King Midas.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.761
Not the muffler guy.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.677
You gotta get a library card.

13:28.764 --> 13:31.201
Hang on, I gotta earn
myself some brownies.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.251
[Joyce]
'Hey, how you doing up there?'

13:37.338 --> 13:40.732
- 'You working hard?'
- Oh, yeah.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.822
'Seeing you up there
blocking the sun'

13:42.909 --> 13:46.347
'reminds me of when
my husband was alive.'

13:46.434 --> 13:48.262
'He was always
working on the roof.'

13:48.349 --> 13:51.091
Well, Chicago winters,
lots of wear and tear.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.484
- I may be up here for a while.
- 'You hungry?'

13:53.571 --> 13:54.790
'You want a sandwich?'

13:54.877 --> 13:56.705
Ooh, I'd love
a salami and cheese.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.099
'Too bad, he loved
peppers and meatballs.'

13:59.186 --> 14:01.101
'Incoming!'

14:03.233 --> 14:05.322
That'll work!

14:05.409 --> 14:07.716
Can't talk now, Carl,
this is a two-hand job.

14:14.244 --> 14:16.116
Anything look familiar?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.335
The stop signs do.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.947
But I think they use
the same ones all over town.

14:22.949 --> 14:25.821
Alright, where is the last
place you remember parking it?

14:25.908 --> 14:28.606
I had a dentist appointment
on Wednesday.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.870
I've driven it since then,
but that's the last place

14:30.957 --> 14:32.262
I remember parking it.

14:34.177 --> 14:37.833
Okay, any idea what clubs
you went to last night?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.662
Goth, gay?

14:40.749 --> 14:43.143
Elks?

14:43.230 --> 14:44.753
There's a couple
of stamps on my hand.

14:44.840 --> 14:46.320
You don't have
a black light, do you?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.931
No, I don't.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.803
For crying out loud,
Victoria, think.

14:51.891 --> 14:53.980
Hey, if you're gonna bark at me

14:54.067 --> 14:57.200
you can take me home and I will
get Mike to help me look.

14:57.287 --> 15:00.247
My fiance is not
your personal lo jack.

15:00.334 --> 15:04.555
Besides, mom probably
has him planting corn by now.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.296
All I know is,
he's a lot more patient

15:06.383 --> 15:07.863
and understanding than you.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
That's because he hasn't
played car-and-seek

15:09.952 --> 15:12.955
every Sunday since you got
your learner's permit.

15:13.042 --> 15:15.610
Can we at least assume
it's still in Illinois?

15:17.351 --> 15:19.744
You know, when I told Mike
about misplacing my car

15:19.831 --> 15:21.790
he was not mean or judgmental.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.793
Mm-mm, no, he was firm but fair.

15:24.880 --> 15:28.318
- Just like daddy.
- Victoria, focus.

15:28.405 --> 15:30.625
Like, anything
around here ring a bell?

15:30.712 --> 15:32.496
Bars, restaurants?

15:32.583 --> 15:35.412
Maybe one of your shoes
laying in the road?

15:35.499 --> 15:37.327
Both shoes are accounted for.

15:37.414 --> 15:39.721
But keep your eyes peeled
for a hair scrunchie

15:39.808 --> 15:42.680
and a black laced bra.

15:42.767 --> 15:44.465
Alright, I'm done.

15:44.552 --> 15:46.293
Okay, we'll just
wait for your car

15:46.380 --> 15:48.121
to get booted
and towed like last time.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.253
No, last time we drove around

15:50.340 --> 15:53.387
I eventually remembered
I parked it in the garage.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.476
- Oh, wait.
- No.

15:55.563 --> 15:57.565
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
- No!

16:01.525 --> 16:04.441
You have got yourself a real
prize there, young lady.

16:04.528 --> 16:06.139
I know, mom, he's a great guy.

16:06.226 --> 16:07.662
Wait, he's more
than a great guy.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.490
He does whatever
I ask him to do

16:09.577 --> 16:12.797
and eats whatever
I toss up on the roof.

16:12.884 --> 16:15.670
It's like having a big pet
raccoon that can fix stuff.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.630
Oh.

16:22.198 --> 16:25.549
There's my hard-working man.

16:25.636 --> 16:28.291
Nice fit, huh? Two more
pockets and I'm a pool table.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.906
Mike, why-why are you wearing
my dad's clothes?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.908
Oh, I gave him a bunch
of daddy's stuff.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.172
You know, the last time
he wore this suit

16:39.259 --> 16:42.479
we were sharing a J
at a Doobie Brothers concert.

16:42.566 --> 16:46.440
Or sharing a doobie
at an O-Jay's concert, I forget.

16:46.527 --> 16:47.528
It was the Doobie Brothers.

16:47.615 --> 16:48.616
I found the ticket stubs

16:48.703 --> 16:49.834
and an ancient tootsie roll.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.184
Oh, daddy loved

16:51.271 --> 16:52.750
his tootsie rolls.

16:52.837 --> 16:55.101
Can I see it?

16:55.188 --> 16:57.277
Well, the real memory
is the ticket stubs, right?

16:59.975 --> 17:01.629
I'm kinda freaking out here.

17:01.716 --> 17:03.935
Mike, you don't
have to wear that.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.937
Why? I think I look
pretty good in it.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.591
You look like you
should be standing in a field

17:07.678 --> 17:09.158
selling green beans.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.423
Never mind her,
you look great.

17:13.510 --> 17:14.816
Now, why don't you sit
right down here

17:14.903 --> 17:16.165
at the head of the table?

17:16.252 --> 17:18.428
We're having pot roast,
mashed potatoes

17:18.515 --> 17:20.909
and your favorite dessert,
banana cream pie.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.519
- Oh.
- That's not his favorite.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.608
Mike, tell 'em,
German chocolate.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.567
That's cake,
we're talking pie now.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.397
Isn't he adorable?

17:30.484 --> 17:33.226
Mike, before we go to bed,
will you read me a story?

17:33.313 --> 17:36.577
Oh, come on, this has gone
from weird to creepy.

17:36.664 --> 17:40.233
Victoria, he is not your father.
Mom, he is not your husband.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.670
Uh, hang on, Moll, they're just
trying to make me feel welcome.

17:42.757 --> 17:43.932
Which is more than you're doing.

17:44.019 --> 17:44.976
You won't even let the poor

17:45.064 --> 17:46.282
bastard hang up a picture.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.198
I didn't say anything.

17:51.635 --> 17:54.073
Plus, you're the one who told us
to make him feel at home.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.118
I meant be friendly,
make small talk.

17:56.205 --> 17:58.512
Not dress him up
like my dead father.

17:58.599 --> 18:00.035
Hey, it fits him.

18:00.122 --> 18:01.297
There's three guys in Chicago

18:01.384 --> 18:03.299
that can wear that suit.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.649
Then get one of the other guys
'cause this one's mine.

18:05.736 --> 18:08.435
You're so selfish, Molly,
you never share anything.

18:08.522 --> 18:10.132
'Remember how she never
let me ride her bike?'

18:10.219 --> 18:12.308
[Molly]
'Oh, hey-hey, if I had lent you
the ten-speed'

18:12.395 --> 18:15.572
'we'd still be driving around
right now looking for it!'

18:15.659 --> 18:17.096
[Joyce]
'The two of you
are giving me a headache.'

18:17.183 --> 18:19.185
[Molly]
'She started it.'

18:23.319 --> 18:24.668
'So how come you get to
dress him up, but I can't?'

18:24.755 --> 18:26.496
'Because I'm the one
that's marrying him.'

18:26.583 --> 18:28.498
'Is that a shot at me because
I haven't found a man yet?'

18:28.585 --> 18:30.718
[Molly]
'Have you looked in the garage?'

18:30.805 --> 18:33.112
I'm telling you, Carl,
it's like paradise.

18:35.331 --> 18:37.594
Guess what I'm doing right now.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.248
How'd you know?

18:39.335 --> 18:40.815
No, I mean,
how'd you know it was pie?

18:42.599 --> 18:45.776
You cannot hear it in my voice.

18:45.863 --> 18:48.301
Fine, if you're so smart,
what am I wearing?

18:48.388 --> 18:52.348
Wrong, green leisure suit.

18:52.435 --> 18:53.915
Yeah, Molly's mom gave it to me.

18:54.002 --> 18:57.397
I know, it's a sweet deal.
Sure, come on over.

18:57.484 --> 18:59.877
Ladder's around back and I'll
try and save you some pie.

19:02.097 --> 19:03.403
[Joyce]
'It's your squabbling
that kept me'

19:03.490 --> 19:04.795
'a single mother
all those years.'

19:04.882 --> 19:06.319
[Molly]
'Oh, don't play that card.'

19:06.406 --> 19:08.103
'You've had more boyfriends
than she's had.'

19:08.190 --> 19:09.409
[Victoria]
'Are you callin' me a slut?'

19:09.496 --> 19:11.280
[Joyce]
'Are you calling me a slut?'

19:11.367 --> 19:12.977
[Molly]
'Just stay away from my fiance.'

19:13.064 --> 19:15.589
'And yes, I am!'

19:22.378 --> 19:23.553
[theme music]
