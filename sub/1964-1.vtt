WEBVTT

01:51.960 --> 01:55.567
I'm dying of thirst over here.
Come on! Come on!

01:56.440 --> 01:58.124
- Here you are.
- Thank you kindly.

02:02.160 --> 02:04.561
- Oh, watch it!
- Sorry, darling.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.161
- There you are.
- Thank you.

02:15.360 --> 02:16.850
Master Stadle.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.370
Mind if I join you?

02:48.760 --> 02:50.330
I'll have the same.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.691
I should introduce myself.
My name is Gandalf.

03:00.280 --> 03:01.406
Gandalf the Grey.

03:01.960 --> 03:03.644
I know who you are.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.163
Well, now. This is a fine chance.

03:09.360 --> 03:13.046
What brings Thorin Oakenshield to Bree?

03:15.920 --> 03:17.570
I received word that my father...

03:18.360 --> 03:19.575
...had been seen wandering...

03:19.600 --> 03:21.568
...the Wilds near Dunland.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.485
I went looking.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.731
I found no sign of him.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.329
Thrain.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.202
You're like the others.

03:34.480 --> 03:35.811
You think he is dead.

03:36.360 --> 03:38.567
I was not at the Battle of Moria.

03:38.800 --> 03:40.404
No...

03:41.440 --> 03:43.408
...but I was.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.325
<i>My grandfather...</i>

03:48.560 --> 03:49.447
<i>Thror...</i>

03:49.680 --> 03:50.522
<i>...was slain.</i>

03:50.920 --> 03:51.842
No!

03:57.320 --> 03:57.969
Father.

03:58.200 --> 03:58.803
Stay back.

03:59.040 --> 04:00.530
No. I will fight with you.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.167
Azog means to kill us all.

04:03.880 --> 04:07.646
One by one, he will destroy the line of Durin.

04:07.880 --> 04:11.441
But by mine's life, he shall not take my son.

04:11.720 --> 04:12.960
You will stay here.

04:16.959 --> 04:20.964
<i>My father led a charge
towards the Dimrill Gate.</i>

04:21.200 --> 04:21.962
<i>He never returned.</i>

04:22.240 --> 04:23.002
Father!

04:33.600 --> 04:36.968
<i>"Thrain is gone," they told me.</i>

04:37.200 --> 04:39.646
<i>"He is one of the fallen."</i>

04:40.360 --> 04:44.001
<i>But at the end of that battle,
I searched amongst the slain.</i>

04:44.240 --> 04:46.402
<i>To the last body.</i>

04:46.680 --> 04:48.887
My father was not among the dead.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.929
Thorin, it's been a long time...

04:51.160 --> 04:53.049
...since anything but rumor was heard...

04:53.280 --> 04:54.167
...of Thrain.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.003
He still lives.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.765
I am sure of it.

05:01.800 --> 05:05.441
The ring your grandfather wore,
one of the seven...

05:05.680 --> 05:07.250
...given the Dwarf-lords...

05:07.480 --> 05:09.130
...many years ago...

05:09.560 --> 05:11.403
...what became of it?

05:13.640 --> 05:16.962
He gave it to my father
before they went into battle.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.044
So Thrain was wearing it when he...

05:20.600 --> 05:21.681
When he went missing.

05:21.960 --> 05:23.007
Mm.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.120
- That's that, then.
- There you are.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.050
My father came to see you...

05:31.760 --> 05:32.960
...before the Battle of Moria.

05:33.240 --> 05:34.651
What did you say to him?

05:34.880 --> 05:38.282
I urged him to march upon Erebor,
to rally...

05:38.560 --> 05:40.403
...the seven armies of the Dwarves...

05:40.640 --> 05:42.563
...to destroy the dragon and take back...

05:42.800 --> 05:44.450
...the Lonely Mountain.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.603
And I would say the same to you.

05:47.320 --> 05:49.846
Take back your homeland.

05:53.640 --> 05:56.849
This is no chance meeting,
is it, Gandalf?

05:57.960 --> 05:59.041
No.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.331
It is not.

06:01.800 --> 06:03.290
The Lonely Mountain troubles me...

06:03.520 --> 06:07.206
...Thorin. That dragon
has sat there long enough.

06:07.440 --> 06:08.487
Sooner or later...

06:08.760 --> 06:11.764
...darker minds will turn towards Erebor.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.766
I ran into some unsavory characters...

06:15.000 --> 06:17.287
...whilst traveling on the Greenway.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.291
They mistook me for a Vagabond.

06:20.560 --> 06:21.766
I imagine they regretted that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.446
One of them was carrying a message.

06:26.760 --> 06:28.250
It is Black Speech.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.170
A promise of payment.

06:33.600 --> 06:34.601
For what?

06:36.440 --> 06:37.487
Your head.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.643
Someone wants you dead.

06:42.960 --> 06:46.123
Thorin, you can wait no longer.
You are...

06:46.360 --> 06:48.044
...the heir to the Throne of Durin.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.729
Unite the armies of the Dwarves.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.088
Together, you have the might and power...

06:53.320 --> 06:55.243
...to retake Erebor.

06:55.760 --> 06:57.762
Summon a meeting
of the seven Dwarf families.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.729
Demand they stand by their oath.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.891
The seven armies swore that oath
to the one who wields the King's Jewel.

07:04.120 --> 07:05.167
The Arkenstone.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.160
It is the only thing that will...

07:07.280 --> 07:08.805
...unite them,
and in case you have forgotten...

07:09.040 --> 07:11.327
...that jewel was stolen by Smaug.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.245
What if I were to help you reclaim it?

07:20.000 --> 07:21.047
How?

07:22.320 --> 07:24.322
The Arkenstone lies half a world away...

07:24.560 --> 07:27.086
...buried beneath the feet
of a fire-breathing dragon.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.481
Yes, it does.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.406
Which is why we're going to need a burglar.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.440
How close is the pack?

08:34.559 --> 08:38.121
Too close. A couple of leagues, no more.
But that's not the worst of it.

08:38.360 --> 08:40.840
- Have the Wargs picked up our scent?
- Not yet. But they will do.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.441
- We have another problem.
- Did they see you?

08:43.679 --> 08:44.283
They saw you.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.240
No, that's not it.

08:45.760 --> 08:46.560
What did I tell you?

08:46.760 --> 08:48.091
Quiet as a mouse.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.366
Excellent burglar material.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.920
Will you listen? Will you just...

08:52.080 --> 08:53.241
...listen?

08:53.480 --> 08:55.720
I'm trying to tell you
there is something else out there.

08:57.920 --> 09:00.161
What form did it take?

09:00.720 --> 09:01.881
Like a bear?

09:03.320 --> 09:04.810
Ye... Yes, but bigger.

09:05.040 --> 09:06.121
Much bigger.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.206
You knew about this beast?

09:10.120 --> 09:11.246
I say we double back.

09:11.520 --> 09:13.602
And be run down by a pack of Orcs?

09:13.920 --> 09:15.570
There is a house...

09:17.400 --> 09:21.291
...it's not far from here,
where we might take refuge.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.760
Whose house?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.246
Are they friend or foe?

09:25.440 --> 09:26.771
Neither.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.728
He will help us or...

09:30.520 --> 09:31.885
...he will kill us.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.364
What choice do we have?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.081
None.

09:45.360 --> 09:46.850
Come on!

09:57.120 --> 09:58.929
This way! Quickly!

09:59.200 --> 09:59.803
Run!

10:02.240 --> 10:03.765
Bombur, come on!

10:08.560 --> 10:10.050
To the house!

10:11.640 --> 10:12.641
Run!

10:21.120 --> 10:22.485
Come on, get inside.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.201
Open the door!

10:37.480 --> 10:38.606
Quickly!

10:47.800 --> 10:49.643
- Push!
- Push!

10:53.560 --> 10:54.163
Dwalin!

10:54.400 --> 10:55.280
Come on, lads!

11:00.280 --> 11:00.883
What is...

11:01.120 --> 11:01.882
...that?

11:02.840 --> 11:04.444
That is our host.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.202
His name is Beorn.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.607
And he's a skin-changer.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.248
Sometimes he's a huge black bear.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.001
Sometimes he's a great strong man.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.362
The bear is unpredictable...

11:24.600 --> 11:26.807
...but the man can be reasoned with.
However...

11:27.080 --> 11:30.289
...he is not overfond of Dwarves.

11:33.200 --> 11:34.440
He's leaving.

11:34.680 --> 11:36.648
Come away from there.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.366
It's not natural. None of it.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.568
It's obvious. He's under some...

11:41.840 --> 11:42.762
...dark spell.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.001
Don't be a fool.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.641
He's under no enchantment but his own.

11:47.200 --> 11:50.090
All right, now get some sleep. All of you.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.687
You'll be safe here tonight.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.529
I hope.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.001
Don't blame me!

16:17.280 --> 16:18.691
Come on, Dori!

16:28.080 --> 16:30.606
Well, I say we should leg it.
Slip out the back way.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.850
I'm not running from anyone, beast or no.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.411
There is no point in arguing.

16:35.960 --> 16:36.722
We cannot pass...

16:36.960 --> 16:38.800
...through the Wilderland
without Beorn's help.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.889
We'll be hunted down
before we ever get to the forest.

16:43.120 --> 16:44.326
Ah, Bilbo.

16:44.600 --> 16:45.362
There you are.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.243
Now...

16:46.520 --> 16:49.490
...this will require some delicate handling.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.768
We must tread very carefully.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.005
The last person to have startled him
was torn to shreds.

16:58.320 --> 16:59.200
I will go first and...

16:59.400 --> 17:00.640
Uh, Bilbo?

17:00.880 --> 17:02.609
You come with me.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.486
- Is this a good idea?
- Yes.

17:06.720 --> 17:09.007
Now, the rest of you, you just wait here...

17:09.240 --> 17:11.810
- ...and don't come out until I give the signal.
- Right.

17:12.040 --> 17:13.280
Wait for the signal.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.842
And no sudden moves or loud noises,
and don't overcrowd him.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.401
And only come out in pairs. Right.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.204
No, actually, Bombur...

17:22.760 --> 17:24.842
...um, you count as two
so you should come out alone.

17:25.079 --> 17:26.127
Mm.

17:27.319 --> 17:29.926
Remember, wait for the signal.

17:30.160 --> 17:32.845
The signal. Right.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.120
What signal would that be?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.400
- Ahem.
- You're nervous.

17:55.680 --> 17:58.889
Nervous? What nonsense.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.282
Good morning.

18:06.880 --> 18:08.689
Good morning!

18:11.520 --> 18:12.965
Who are you?

18:13.200 --> 18:17.000
I'm Gandalf. Gandalf the Grey.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.729
Never heard of him.

18:26.880 --> 18:28.041
I'm a Wizard.

18:28.480 --> 18:31.165
Perhaps you've heard of my colleague
Radagast the Brown.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.404
He resides in the southern borders
of Mirkwood.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.768
What do you want?

18:37.000 --> 18:40.561
Well, simply to thank you
for your hospitality.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.560
You may have noticed that we took refuge...

18:42.720 --> 18:44.484
...in your lodgings here last night.

18:46.160 --> 18:46.763
Who is this...

18:47.000 --> 18:47.680
...little fellow?

18:48.400 --> 18:50.607
Well, this would be Mr. Baggins...

18:50.840 --> 18:51.887
...from the Shire.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.281
He's not a Dwarf, is he?

18:56.760 --> 18:59.650
Why, no. No, he's a Hobbit.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.801
A good family
and unimpeachable reputation.

19:04.040 --> 19:07.442
A Halfling and a Wizard.

19:08.360 --> 19:09.600
How come you here?

19:09.840 --> 19:10.523
Oh, well, the fact is...

19:10.760 --> 19:13.001
...that we've had a bad time of it...

19:13.240 --> 19:16.084
...from Goblins in the mountains.

19:16.320 --> 19:17.685
What did you go near Goblins for?

19:17.960 --> 19:19.450
Stupid thing to do.

19:19.720 --> 19:20.926
You are absolutely...

19:21.160 --> 19:22.241
- ...right. No, it...
- There it is. Go.

19:22.480 --> 19:24.767
- Go.
- ...was terrible.

19:33.760 --> 19:34.522
Dwalin...

19:34.760 --> 19:35.727
...and Balin.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.166
And I must...

19:37.440 --> 19:39.408
...confess that, uh, several...

19:39.640 --> 19:42.928
...of our group are, in fact, Dwarves.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.567
Do you call two...

19:45.800 --> 19:48.041
..."several"?

19:48.280 --> 19:50.851
Well, uh, now you put it that way...

19:53.320 --> 19:54.400
Yes, there could be more...

19:54.600 --> 19:55.647
...than two.

19:56.400 --> 19:57.083
Go, go.

19:57.520 --> 19:58.440
Wait, that's us.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.287
Oh, and here are some more...

20:03.520 --> 20:05.284
...of our, uh, happy troop.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.727
And do you call six a "troop"?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.201
What are you, a traveling circus?

20:12.320 --> 20:13.048
Go.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.361
Go. Go, go.

20:17.640 --> 20:21.087
Dori and Ori at your service.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.040
I don't...

20:22.160 --> 20:23.000
...want your service.

20:23.240 --> 20:24.480
Absolutely understandable.

20:24.720 --> 20:25.403
Go.

20:25.640 --> 20:26.607
Go.

20:29.240 --> 20:32.084
Oh, Fili and Kili. I'd quite forgotten. Yes.

20:33.320 --> 20:35.561
Oh, yes, and Nori, Bofur...

20:35.800 --> 20:37.529
...Bifur...

20:39.000 --> 20:40.650
...and Bombur.

20:41.800 --> 20:43.404
Is that it?

20:46.200 --> 20:47.725
Are there any more?

20:55.040 --> 20:56.087
Ah.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.766
So you are the one they call Oakenshield.

21:04.440 --> 21:05.771
Tell me...

21:06.440 --> 21:07.362
...why is Azog...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.568
...the Defiler hunting you?

21:10.080 --> 21:11.605
You know of Azog?

21:12.600 --> 21:13.408
How?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.644
My people were the first to live
in the mountains...

21:18.080 --> 21:20.606
...before the Orcs came down
from the North.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.963
The Defiler killed most of my family.

21:24.640 --> 21:25.448
But some he...

21:25.720 --> 21:26.801
...enslaved.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.965
Not for work, you understand...

21:30.200 --> 21:31.645
...but for sport.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.047
Caging skin-changers...

21:34.280 --> 21:38.080
...and torturing them
seemed to amuse him.

21:39.600 --> 21:41.125
There are others like you?

21:42.680 --> 21:44.205
Once there were many.

21:45.160 --> 21:46.002
And now?

21:47.720 --> 21:49.529
Now there is only one.

21:52.160 --> 21:53.286
You need to reach...

21:53.520 --> 21:57.206
...the mountain before
the last days of autumn.

21:57.440 --> 21:58.566
Before Durin's Day falls.

21:58.800 --> 21:59.767
Yes.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.890
You are running out of time.

22:02.120 --> 22:04.327
Which is why we must
go through Mirkwood.

22:04.560 --> 22:07.370
A darkness lies upon that forest.

22:07.600 --> 22:10.649
Fell things creep beneath those trees.

22:11.160 --> 22:13.083
I would not venture there...

22:13.320 --> 22:15.163
...except in great need.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.402
We will take the Elven Road.

22:17.680 --> 22:18.647
That path is still safe.

22:18.880 --> 22:19.961
"Safe"?

22:20.480 --> 22:21.811
The Wood Elves of Mirkwood...

22:22.040 --> 22:23.080
...are not like their kin.

22:23.640 --> 22:25.085
They're less wise...

22:25.360 --> 22:27.249
...and more dangerous.

22:28.680 --> 22:30.284
But it matters not.

22:32.200 --> 22:33.281
What do you mean?

22:33.520 --> 22:36.285
These lands are crawling with Orcs.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.725
Their numbers are growing.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.445
And you are on foot.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.327
You will never reach...

22:43.560 --> 22:45.608
...the forest alive.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.401
I don't like Dwarves.

22:53.400 --> 22:55.084
They're greedy...

22:55.800 --> 22:56.801
...and blind.

22:58.280 --> 23:00.169
Blind to the lives of those they deem...

23:00.440 --> 23:02.886
...lesser than their own.

23:09.520 --> 23:11.761
But Orcs I hate more.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.250
What do you need?

23:23.400 --> 23:24.049
You will leave my...

23:24.280 --> 23:25.884
...ponies before you enter the forest.

23:26.120 --> 23:27.849
Oh, you have my word.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.206
We're being watched.

23:31.440 --> 23:32.566
Yes.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.047
The Orcs will not give up.

23:35.280 --> 23:38.250
They will hunt the Dwarves
until they see them destroyed.

23:38.520 --> 23:41.251
Why now? What has made
the Defiler crawl from his hole?

23:41.520 --> 23:44.205
There is an alliance
between the Orcs of Moria...

23:44.480 --> 23:46.482
...and the sorcerer in Dol Guldur.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.642
Are you sure of this?

23:47.880 --> 23:48.927
Packs have been seen...

23:49.160 --> 23:50.844
...gathering there.

23:51.080 --> 23:53.481
Each day, more and more come.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.288
What do you know of this sorcerer?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.807
The one they call the Necromancer.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.966
I know he is not what he seems.

24:03.200 --> 24:06.124
Fell things are drawn to his power.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.566
Azog pays...

24:07.840 --> 24:09.285
...homage to him.

24:09.520 --> 24:10.806
Gandalf.

24:11.560 --> 24:12.607
Time is wasting.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.848
There is more.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.287
Not long past, word spread...

24:18.560 --> 24:22.565
...the dead had been seen
walking near the High Fells of Rhudaur.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.647
The dead?

24:24.880 --> 24:26.450
Is it true?

24:26.680 --> 24:29.490
Are there tombs in those mountains?

24:33.120 --> 24:35.088
<i>When Angmar fell...</i>

24:35.360 --> 24:38.682
<i>...the Men of the North took his body
and all that he possessed...</i>

24:38.920 --> 24:40.880
<i>...and sealed it within
the High Fells of Rhudaur.</i>

24:43.080 --> 24:44.730
<i>Deep within the rock, they buried him.</i>

24:46.280 --> 24:47.520
<i>In a tomb so dark...</i>

24:48.280 --> 24:49.135
<i>...it would never...</i>

24:49.160 --> 24:50.207
<i>...come to light.</i>

24:52.880 --> 24:53.529
Yes.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.167
Yes, there are tombs up there.

24:59.040 --> 25:02.840
I remember a time when a great evil...

25:03.080 --> 25:05.287
...ruled these lands.

25:05.840 --> 25:06.682
One powerful...

25:06.920 --> 25:09.048
...enough to raise the dead.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.969
If that enemy has returned to Middle-earth...

25:13.240 --> 25:15.607
...I would have you tell me.

25:15.840 --> 25:19.481
Saruman the White says it's not possible.

25:19.720 --> 25:23.566
The enemy was destroyed
and will never return.

25:24.840 --> 25:25.568
And what does...

25:25.800 --> 25:27.325
...Gandalf the Grey say?

25:33.520 --> 25:35.010
Go now.

25:35.760 --> 25:37.888
While you have the light.

25:40.400 --> 25:43.529
Your hunters are not far behind.

26:13.720 --> 26:16.041
The Elven Gate.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.525
Here lies our path...

26:18.800 --> 26:20.290
...through Mirkwood.

26:20.640 --> 26:23.689
No sign of the Orcs.
We have luck on our side.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.048
Set the ponies loose.

26:33.520 --> 26:36.126
Let them return to their master.

26:38.040 --> 26:38.962
This forest...

26:39.240 --> 26:40.651
...feels...

26:41.280 --> 26:42.361
...sick.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.047
As if a disease lies upon it.

26:47.560 --> 26:49.164
Is there no way around?

26:49.400 --> 26:51.880
Not unless we go 200 miles north.

26:52.120 --> 26:54.202
Or twice that distance...

26:55.160 --> 26:56.446
...south.

27:22.560 --> 27:25.723
<i>Something moves in the shadows unseen...</i>

27:27.080 --> 27:29.560
<i>...hidden from our sight.</i>

27:30.600 --> 27:33.604
<i>Every day it grows in strength.</i>

27:34.760 --> 27:37.206
<i>Beware the Necromancer.</i>

27:37.840 --> 27:39.842
<i>He is not what he seems.</i>

27:44.240 --> 27:47.847
<i>If our Enemy has returned,
we must know.</i>

27:49.040 --> 27:51.964
<i>Go to the tombs in the mountains.</i>

27:52.720 --> 27:54.882
The High Fells.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.325
So be it.

28:04.520 --> 28:05.248
Not my horse!

28:05.480 --> 28:06.049
I need it!

28:08.480 --> 28:09.686
You're not leaving us?

28:09.920 --> 28:11.684
I would not do this unless I had to.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.606
You've changed...

28:19.880 --> 28:21.609
...Bilbo Baggins.

28:23.000 --> 28:26.049
You're not the same Hobbit
as the one who left the Shire.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.530
I was going to tell you.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.246
I...

28:38.120 --> 28:40.202
...found something in the Goblin tunnels.

28:40.480 --> 28:41.811
Found what?

28:46.560 --> 28:48.403
What did you find?

28:51.880 --> 28:53.120
My courage.

28:55.920 --> 28:57.968
Good. Well, that's good.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.609
You'll need it.

29:02.920 --> 29:05.491
I'll be waiting for you
at the overlook, before...

29:05.760 --> 29:06.886
...the slopes of Erebor.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.487
Keep the map and key safe.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.730
Do not enter that mountain without me.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.883
This is not the Greenwood of old.

29:22.160 --> 29:25.448
There is a stream in the woods
that carries a dark enchantment.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.603
Do not touch the water.

29:27.840 --> 29:30.241
Cross only by the stone bridge.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.086
The very air of the forest
is heavy with illusion.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.051
It'll seek to enter your mind
and lead you astray.

29:36.480 --> 29:38.209
"Lead us astray"?

29:38.640 --> 29:40.005
What does that mean?

29:40.360 --> 29:43.489
You must stay on the path.
Do not leave it.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.962
If you do, you'll never...

29:46.200 --> 29:47.486
...find it again.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.730
No matter what may come, stay on...

29:50.960 --> 29:51.643
...the path!

29:51.880 --> 29:55.043
Come on. We must reach the mountain
before the sun sets on Durin's Day.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.281
- Durin's Day?
- Let's go.

29:56.560 --> 29:59.040
It is our one chance
to find the hidden door.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.450
The path turns this way.

30:37.480 --> 30:38.686
This way.

30:47.280 --> 30:50.443
Air. I need air.

30:50.680 --> 30:52.728
My head, it's swimming!

31:00.120 --> 31:02.930
- We found the bridge.
- Bridge.

31:06.720 --> 31:07.801
Oh.

31:12.360 --> 31:14.283
We could try and swim it.

31:14.520 --> 31:16.807
Didn't you hear what Gandalf said?

31:17.040 --> 31:20.089
A dark magic lies upon this forest.

31:20.960 --> 31:22.769
The waters of this stream are enchanted.

31:23.280 --> 31:25.851
Doesn't look very enchanting to me.

31:26.080 --> 31:28.845
We must find another way across.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.289
These vines look strong enough.

31:39.520 --> 31:41.204
Kili!

31:42.440 --> 31:44.329
We send the lightest first.

31:58.920 --> 32:00.604
It's all right.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.210
Can't see any problem.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.726
There's one.

32:05.960 --> 32:06.563
Everything's...

32:06.800 --> 32:08.404
...fine.

32:39.120 --> 32:41.691
Something is not right.

32:41.920 --> 32:43.490
This is not right at all.

32:43.720 --> 32:46.007
Stay where you are! Oh.

32:47.960 --> 32:49.610
I can't get a grip.

33:30.040 --> 33:31.804
What are you doing?

33:46.600 --> 33:48.807
You shouldn't have done that.

33:49.720 --> 33:50.642
It's bad luck.

33:50.920 --> 33:52.365
I don't believe in luck.

33:53.040 --> 33:54.690
We make our own luck.

34:20.600 --> 34:21.681
We need...

34:21.920 --> 34:23.842
...to take a rest.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.719
What is that?

34:48.040 --> 34:51.089
Those voices.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.926
Can you hear them?

34:55.360 --> 34:56.850
I hear nothing.

34:59.560 --> 35:02.006
No wind...

35:03.200 --> 35:05.441
...no birds.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.884
What hour is it?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.805
I do not know.

35:12.080 --> 35:12.888
I do not even...

35:13.120 --> 35:15.600
...know what day it is.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.403
This is taking too long.

35:23.120 --> 35:24.406
Is there no end to this...

35:24.680 --> 35:27.081
...accursed forest?

35:27.320 --> 35:28.606
None that I can see.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.486
Only trees and more trees.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.570
This way.

35:46.520 --> 35:49.763
- Gandalf said...
- Do as I say. Follow me.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.327
Attercop.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.723
No, no, wait.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.163
Wait.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.564
Stop.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.804
We can't leave the pa...

36:23.440 --> 36:25.442
We must stay on the path.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.447
I don't remember this bit.

36:45.720 --> 36:47.324
None of it's familiar.

36:47.600 --> 36:49.329
It's got to be here.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.930
It can't have just disappeared.

36:53.160 --> 36:55.561
Unless someone's moved it.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.167
It's not over here neither.

37:26.080 --> 37:27.047
Look.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.930
A tobacco pouch.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.606
There's Dwarves in these woods.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.491
Dwarves from the Blue Mountains,
no less.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.370
This is exactly the same as mine.

37:36.640 --> 37:39.291
Because it is yours. Do you understand?

37:39.560 --> 37:41.369
We're going around in circles.
We are lost.

37:41.600 --> 37:43.648
We are not lost. We keep heading east.

37:43.880 --> 37:46.531
But which way is east? We've lost the sun.

37:46.760 --> 37:48.280
I thought you were the expert.

37:49.280 --> 37:50.281
The sun.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.764
We have to find...

37:53.040 --> 37:54.280
...the sun.

37:56.120 --> 37:57.281
Up there.

37:57.520 --> 37:58.362
We need to...

37:58.600 --> 38:00.125
...get above the canopy.

38:04.120 --> 38:06.043
What was that?

38:07.240 --> 38:10.130
Enough! Quiet! All of you!

38:12.080 --> 38:13.844
We're being watched.

39:02.240 --> 39:04.004
I can see a lake!

39:04.840 --> 39:07.002
And a river.

39:08.720 --> 39:10.370
And the Lonely Mountain.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.609
We're almost there!

39:14.520 --> 39:15.851
Can you hear me?

39:17.120 --> 39:19.282
I know which way to go!

39:22.600 --> 39:23.726
Hello?

39:33.080 --> 39:34.286
Hello.

39:46.360 --> 39:47.327
Oh, no.

39:47.560 --> 39:48.402
Oh, come on.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.251
Kill them! Kill them.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.528
Eat them now,
while their blood is running.

41:32.800 --> 41:36.282
Their hide is tough,
but there's good juice inside.

41:36.520 --> 41:37.169
Stick it again.

41:37.400 --> 41:39.448
Stick it again. Finish it off.

41:40.600 --> 41:42.329
The meat's alive and kicking!

41:42.600 --> 41:43.375
Kill him.

41:43.400 --> 41:44.162
Kill him now.

41:44.400 --> 41:46.004
Let us feast.

41:46.240 --> 41:47.480
Feast! Feast!

41:47.720 --> 41:49.802
Feast! Feast!

41:51.160 --> 41:52.605
Eat them alive!

41:52.840 --> 41:54.888
Feast!

42:01.280 --> 42:03.123
- What is it?
- What is it?

42:05.000 --> 42:07.207
Eat them alive!

42:10.440 --> 42:12.568
Fat and juicy.

42:15.640 --> 42:17.051
Just a...

42:17.280 --> 42:18.361
...little taste.

42:29.040 --> 42:31.407
Curse it! Where is it?! Where is it?!

42:32.760 --> 42:33.886
Here.

42:34.840 --> 42:36.763
Ah! It stings!

42:37.000 --> 42:37.887
It stings!

42:43.840 --> 42:45.171
Sting.

42:46.120 --> 42:47.406
That's a good name.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.326
Sting.

43:08.760 --> 43:10.444
You all right there, Bofur?

43:10.800 --> 43:12.006
- I'm all right!
- Get it off me!

43:12.240 --> 43:13.366
Where's Bilbo?

43:13.600 --> 43:14.567
I'm up here!

43:46.920 --> 43:47.680
Grab the legs!

43:48.760 --> 43:49.727
Pull!

43:51.720 --> 43:52.721
Pull!

43:55.800 --> 43:58.087
Where is it? Where is it? Come on.

43:58.800 --> 43:59.961
Where is it?

44:22.120 --> 44:22.882
No!

44:23.600 --> 44:24.806
No! No!

44:25.040 --> 44:27.008
Thorin! Get them!

44:27.240 --> 44:28.162
Come on!

44:31.840 --> 44:33.444
Look out, brother!

44:36.200 --> 44:36.849
Fili!

45:00.560 --> 45:01.971
Mine.

45:37.360 --> 45:38.080
Come on...

45:38.200 --> 45:39.361
...keep up!

45:39.960 --> 45:41.246
We're clear!

46:02.240 --> 46:04.561
Do not think I won't kill you, Dwarf.

46:04.800 --> 46:06.484
It would be my pleasure.

46:11.200 --> 46:12.770
- Help!
- Kili!

46:30.960 --> 46:31.961
Throw me a dagger!

46:32.880 --> 46:33.881
Quick!

46:34.520 --> 46:35.203
If you think I'm giving you...

46:35.440 --> 46:36.521
...a weapon, Dwarf...

46:36.760 --> 46:37.841
...you're mistaken!

46:44.000 --> 46:45.365
Search them.

46:50.840 --> 46:52.968
B'ey! Give it back! That's private!

46:53.240 --> 46:54.401
Who is this?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.165
- Your brother?
- That is...

46:56.400 --> 46:57.686
...my wife!

46:57.960 --> 47:00.042
And what is this horrid creature?

47:00.320 --> 47:01.446
A Goblin-mutant?

47:01.680 --> 47:03.603
That's my wee lad, Gimli.

47:35.520 --> 47:36.920
Where did you get this?

47:37.280 --> 47:38.486
It was given to me.

47:42.040 --> 47:45.328
Not just a thief, but a liar as well.

47:50.080 --> 47:51.605
Thorin, where's Bilbo?

48:55.240 --> 48:57.322
Unh! This is not the end of it!

48:58.160 --> 49:00.845
- Do you hear me?!
- Hey, let us out of here!

49:01.120 --> 49:02.645
Get off me!

49:09.520 --> 49:11.045
Aren't you going to search me?

49:12.680 --> 49:14.887
I could have anything down my trousers.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.284
Or nothing.

49:52.880 --> 49:54.040
- Again!
- Leave it!

49:54.720 --> 49:56.131
There's no way out!

49:56.360 --> 49:58.362
This is no Orc dungeon.

49:58.640 --> 50:01.120
These are the Halls
of the Woodland Realm.

50:01.400 --> 50:05.200
No one leaves here
but by the king's consent.

50:09.880 --> 50:13.441
Some may imagine
that a noble quest is at hand.

50:14.080 --> 50:16.924
A quest to reclaim a homeland...

50:17.200 --> 50:18.929
...and slay a dragon.

50:20.320 --> 50:24.325
I myself suspect a more prosaic motive.

50:25.200 --> 50:26.850
Attempted burglary.

50:27.600 --> 50:29.887
Or something of that ilk.

50:33.040 --> 50:33.802
You have found...

50:34.040 --> 50:35.041
...a way in.

50:35.280 --> 50:36.455
You seek that which would...

50:36.480 --> 50:39.484
...bestow upon you the right to rule.

50:40.160 --> 50:42.049
The King's Jewel.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.450
The Arkenstone.

50:46.720 --> 50:50.042
It is precious to you beyond measure.

50:51.040 --> 50:52.769
I understand that.

50:53.720 --> 50:57.361
There are gems in the mountain
that I too desire.

50:58.680 --> 50:59.681
White gems...

50:59.920 --> 51:01.968
...of pure starlight.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.287
I offer you my help.

51:08.480 --> 51:09.845
I am listening.

51:10.120 --> 51:11.724
I will let you go...

51:12.720 --> 51:15.405
...if you but return what is mine.

51:18.600 --> 51:19.931
A favor for a favor.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.280
You have my word.

51:22.520 --> 51:25.046
One king to another.

51:29.200 --> 51:32.443
I would not trust Thranduil...

51:33.480 --> 51:34.447
...the great king...

51:34.680 --> 51:35.841
...to honor his word...

51:36.080 --> 51:38.606
...should the end of all days
be upon us!

51:39.240 --> 51:39.809
You...

51:40.320 --> 51:41.287
...who lack all...

51:41.520 --> 51:42.521
...honor!

51:43.600 --> 51:45.648
I have seen how you treat your friends.

51:46.320 --> 51:49.961
We came to you once,
starving, homeless...

51:50.200 --> 51:51.645
...seeking your help.

51:52.200 --> 51:54.567
But you turned your back!

51:54.880 --> 51:58.487
You turned away from
the suffering of my people...

51:58.760 --> 52:00.728
...and the inferno that destroyed us.

52:03.240 --> 52:05.402
Do not talk to me of dragon fire.

52:05.880 --> 52:06.449
I know...

52:06.720 --> 52:08.961
...its wrath and ruin.

52:13.120 --> 52:14.326
I have faced...

52:14.600 --> 52:17.365
...the great serpents of the North.

52:19.600 --> 52:20.240
I warned your...

52:20.440 --> 52:23.728
...grandfather of what his greed
would summon.

52:25.280 --> 52:27.203
But he would not listen.

52:31.760 --> 52:33.808
You are just like him.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.044
Stay here if you will...

52:38.280 --> 52:39.850
...and rot.

52:40.080 --> 52:42.003
A hundred years is a mere blink...

52:42.240 --> 52:44.242
...in the life of an Elf.

52:44.480 --> 52:46.164
I'm patient.

52:47.200 --> 52:49.202
I can wait.

52:56.680 --> 52:57.761
Did he offer you a deal?

52:58.000 --> 52:59.161
He did.

53:00.880 --> 53:03.247
I told him he could go
<i>Ã®sh kakhfÃª ai-'d dÃ»r-rugnu!</i>

53:05.000 --> 53:05.808
Him and all his kin!

53:07.840 --> 53:09.604
Well, that's that, then.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.800
A deal was our only hope.

53:17.280 --> 53:19.009
Not our only hope.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.291
I know you're there.

53:29.080 --> 53:32.084
Why do you linger in the shadows?

53:33.240 --> 53:35.481
I was coming to report to you.

53:36.640 --> 53:40.008
I thought I ordered that nest
to be destroyed not two moons past.

53:40.240 --> 53:40.923
We cleared...

53:41.160 --> 53:43.640
...the forest as ordered, my lord.
But more spiders keep...

53:43.880 --> 53:45.000
...coming up from the South.

53:45.240 --> 53:45.843
They are spawning in...

53:46.080 --> 53:48.367
...the ruins of Dol Guldur.
If we could kill them at their source...

53:48.760 --> 53:50.808
That fortress lies beyond our borders.

53:51.080 --> 53:53.845
Keep our lands clear of those
foul creatures. That is your task.

53:54.120 --> 53:56.726
And when we drive them off, what then?

53:57.000 --> 53:58.570
Will they not spread to other lands?

53:58.920 --> 54:00.684
Other lands are not my concern.

54:02.480 --> 54:03.766
The fortunes of the world...

54:04.000 --> 54:05.081
...will rise and fall.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.242
But here in this...

54:06.480 --> 54:07.560
...kingdom, we will endure.

54:13.120 --> 54:14.520
Legolas said you fought well today.

54:19.680 --> 54:21.569
He has grown very fond of you.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.244
I assure you, my lord...

54:26.480 --> 54:29.450
...Legolas thinks of me as
no more than a captain of the guard.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.523
Perhaps he did once.

54:32.560 --> 54:35.086
Now I am not so sure.

54:38.640 --> 54:40.961
I do not think you would allow your son...

54:41.200 --> 54:43.646
...to pledge himself to a lowly Silvan Elf.

54:43.920 --> 54:46.491
No, you are right. I would not.

54:47.320 --> 54:49.527
Still, he cares about you.

54:50.360 --> 54:52.886
Do not give him hope where there is none.

55:31.240 --> 55:34.323
The stone in your hand, what is it?

55:36.760 --> 55:38.285
It is a talisman.

55:41.600 --> 55:43.125
A powerful spell lies upon it.

55:43.400 --> 55:46.085
If any but a Dwarf
reads the runes on this stone...

55:46.920 --> 55:48.160
...they will be forever cursed.

55:54.520 --> 55:55.203
Or not.

55:57.200 --> 56:00.120
Depending on whether you believe
in that kind of thing. It's just a token.

56:03.040 --> 56:04.326
A rune stone.

56:06.480 --> 56:07.083
My mother...

56:07.320 --> 56:09.243
...gave it to me
so I'd remember my promise.

56:11.080 --> 56:12.366
What promise?

56:12.880 --> 56:14.245
That I would come back to her.

56:17.160 --> 56:18.400
She worries.

56:19.840 --> 56:21.410
She thinks I'm reckless.

56:22.120 --> 56:23.246
Are you?

56:25.080 --> 56:25.922
Nah.

56:37.120 --> 56:38.770
Sounds like quite a party...

56:39.040 --> 56:40.405
...you're having up there.

56:41.120 --> 56:43.088
It is <i>Mereth e-nGilith...</i>

56:44.000 --> 56:45.525
...the Feast of Starlight.

56:46.760 --> 56:49.161
All light is sacred to the Eldar.

56:49.840 --> 56:53.208
But Wood Elves love best
the light of the stars.

56:53.880 --> 56:55.370
I always thought it is a cold light.

56:57.520 --> 56:59.761
Remote and far away.

57:01.080 --> 57:02.844
It is memory...

57:03.880 --> 57:05.769
...precious and pure.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.771
Like your promise.

57:21.280 --> 57:23.089
I have walked there sometimes.

57:24.200 --> 57:25.008
Beyond the forest...

57:25.240 --> 57:26.765
...and up into the night.

57:28.360 --> 57:31.364
I have seen the world fall away...

57:32.600 --> 57:35.410
...and the white light of forever fill the air.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.689
I saw a fire moon once.

57:42.600 --> 57:45.251
It rose over the pass near Dunland. Huge.

57:45.640 --> 57:48.086
Red and gold, it was. It filled the sky.

57:49.920 --> 57:52.890
We were an escort for some merchants
from Ered Luin. They were...

57:53.120 --> 57:56.283
...trading in silverwork for furs.
We took the Greenway south...

57:56.840 --> 57:58.808
...keeping the mountain to our left.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.770
And then it appeared.

58:01.320 --> 58:03.049
This huge fire moon...

58:03.560 --> 58:05.130
...lighting our path.

58:05.360 --> 58:07.647
I wish I could show you the caverns.

58:08.880 --> 58:11.565
Galion, you old rogue,
we're running out of drink.

58:12.160 --> 58:15.209
These empty barrels should have been
sent back to Esgaroth hours ago.

58:15.440 --> 58:17.488
The bargeman will be waiting for them.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.841
Say what you like about our...

58:19.080 --> 58:22.402
...ill-tempered king.
He has excellent taste in wine.

58:23.400 --> 58:24.925
Come, Elros, try it.

58:25.640 --> 58:26.482
I have the Dwarves...

58:26.720 --> 58:27.721
...in my charge.

58:28.120 --> 58:31.044
They're locked up. Where can they go? Ha, ha.

58:34.120 --> 58:36.691
I'll wager the sun is on the rise.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.649
Must be nearly dawn.

58:38.880 --> 58:41.201
We're never gonna reach
the mountain, are we?

58:44.160 --> 58:46.242
Not stuck in here, you're not.

58:52.200 --> 58:52.849
Bilbo!

58:53.080 --> 58:53.967
What?

58:55.880 --> 58:58.451
Shh! There are guards nearby!

59:04.200 --> 59:05.122
- Ha, ha, ha.
- Close the doors.

59:05.360 --> 59:07.567
- It'll buy us more time.
- All right, Nori.

59:18.360 --> 59:19.960
- Up the stairs.
- You first.

59:20.080 --> 59:20.683
Ori.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.600
Not that way. Down here. Follow me.

59:23.760 --> 59:24.602
Go.

59:24.840 --> 59:26.365
Easy, now.

59:41.440 --> 59:42.521
This way.

59:45.360 --> 59:46.407
Come on.

59:46.680 --> 59:48.250
I don't believe it. We're in the cellars!

59:48.520 --> 59:50.249
You were supposed to be leading us out,
not further in!

59:50.520 --> 59:51.455
I know what I'm doing!

59:51.480 --> 59:52.288
Shh!

59:52.840 --> 59:54.444
This way! This way!

59:59.440 --> 01:00:00.160
Everyone...

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.640
- ...climb into the barrels quickly.
- Are you mad?

01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:04.443
- They'll find us.
- No, no.

01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.727
They won't, I promise you.

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.487
Please, please. You must trust me.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.441
Do as he says.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:16.920
Move your big ginger head.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:19.640
Bifur, get in...

01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:21.763
...the barrel! Move!

01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:30.130
Everyone's in.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.169
What do we do now?

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.921
Hold your breath.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.760
Hold my breath? What do you mean?

01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:06.365
Where is the Keeper of the Keys?

01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:34.726
Well done, Master Baggins.

01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.441
Go! Come on, let's go!

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:49.090
Hold on!

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.651
Bilbo!

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.480
Hang on!

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.407
- Help!
- Ori!

01:02:38.120 --> 01:02:38.723
No!

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.244
Watch out! There's Orcs!

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.280
Get under the bridge!

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.483
Kili!

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:54.449
Kili!

01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:02.129
Kili.

01:04:56.240 --> 01:04:56.889
Kili!

01:06:21.160 --> 01:06:22.286
Nori!

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:36.161
Cut the log!

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:45.127
Bombur!

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.562
Tauriel.

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:20.601
Oh, it's you!

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.451
Why am I here, Gandalf?

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:23.886
Trust me, Radagast.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.090
I would not have called you here
without good reason.

01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:34.211
This is not a nice place to meet.

01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:35.566
No.

01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:38.010
It is not.

01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:41.606
These are dark spells, Gandalf.

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:44.565
Old and full of hate.

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.171
Who's buried here?

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.888
If he had a name,
it's long since been lost.

01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:52.202
He would have been known only...

01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.761
...as a servant of evil.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:59.288
One of a number.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:05.363
One of nine.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.522
Why now, Gandalf? I don't understand.

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:11.363
The Ringwraiths...

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.409
...have been summoned to Dol Guldur.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:15.608
But it cannot be the Necromancer.

01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.367
A human sorcerer
could not summon such evil.

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:21.568
Who said it was human?

01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:26.881
The Nine only answer to one master.

01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:29.726
We've been blind, Radagast.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.042
And in our blindness...

01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.408
...the Enemy has returned.

01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:39.042
He is summoning his servants.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:41.444
Azog the Defiler...

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:43.683
...is no ordinary hunter.

01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.251
He is a commander.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.042
A commander of legions.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.491
The Enemy is preparing for war.

01:11:53.200 --> 01:11:54.850
It will begin in the East.

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:57.891
His mind is set upon that mountain.

01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:00.003
- Where are you going?
- To rejoin the others.

01:12:00.240 --> 01:12:01.207
Gandalf.

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.125
I started this. I cannot forsake them.

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:07.283
They are in grave danger.

01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.806
If what you say is true...

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.771
...the world is in grave danger.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.441
The power in that fortress
will only grow stronger.

01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.889
You want me to cast my friends aside?

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.201
- Anything behind us?
- Not that I can see.

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.680
- I think we've outrun the Orcs.
- Not for long. We've lost the current.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.649
Bombur's half drowned.

01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:38.969
- Make for the shore!
- Aye.

01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.280
Come on, let's go!

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.209
Gloin, help me, my brother.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.409
Come on, lift yourself.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:48.001
Come on!

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.686
Come on, you big lump, you!

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.529
I'm fine. It's nothing.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:03.682
On your feet.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:05.968
Kili's wounded. His leg needs binding.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.601
There's an Orc pack on our tail.
We keep moving.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:09.762
To where?

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:11.923
To the mountain. We're so close.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.410
A lake lies between us and that mountain.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.927
- We have no way to cross it.
- So then we go around.

01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:21.170
The Orcs will run us down,
as sure as daylight.

01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:23.482
We've no weapons to defend ourselves.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.404
Bind his leg, quickly.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:27.490
You have two minutes.

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:48.722
Do it again...

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.601
...and you're dead.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.526
Excuse me...

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.889
...but you're from Lake-town,
if I'm not mistaken.

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.366
That barge over there...

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.888
...it wouldn't be available for hire,
by any chance?

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.642
What makes you think I would help you?

01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.729
Those boots have seen better days.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.890
As has that coat.

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.928
No doubt you have
some hungry mouths to feed.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.451
How many bairns?

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.010
A boy and two girls.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.571
And your wife, I imagine she's a beauty.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:26.921
Aye.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.441
She was.

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.170
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.283
Oh, come on, come on.
Enough of the niceties.

01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.086
What's your hurry?

01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.566
What's it to you?

01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.484
I would like to know who you are...

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.360
...and what you are doing in these lands.

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:47.006
We are simple merchants
from the Blue Mountains...

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.805
...journeying to see our kin...

01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.650
...in the Iron Hills.

01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:54.008
Simple merchants, you say?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.571
We need food...

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.808
...supplies, weapons.

01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.201
Can you help us?

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.369
I know where these...

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.005
...barrels came from.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.000
What of it?

01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.686
I don't know what business you had
with the Elves...

01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:12.929
...but I don't think it ended well.

01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.283
No one enters Lake-town...

01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:17.488
...but by leave of the Master.

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:20.885
All his wealth comes from trade
with the Woodland Realm.

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:23.925
He would see you in irons before
risking the wrath of King Thranduil.

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:26.807
Offer him more.

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.403
I'll wager there are...

01:15:30.640 --> 01:15:32.563
...ways to enter that town unseen.

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:34.521
Aye.

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.120
But for that...

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:39.731
...you would need a smuggler.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.883
For which we would pay double.

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:54.047
<i>Such is the nature of evil.
Out there in...</i>

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.884
...the vast ignorance of the world...

01:15:56.120 --> 01:15:58.441
...it festers and spreads.

01:15:58.680 --> 01:16:01.411
A shadow that grows in the dark.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:03.729
A sleepless malice as black...

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.884
...as the oncoming wall of night.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:09.770
So it ever was.

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:12.568
So will it always be.

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:17.521
In time, all foul things come forth.

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.730
You were tracking a company of 13 Dwarves.

01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:21.927
Why?

01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:23.491
Not 13.

01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.285
Not anymore.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:26.922
The young one...

01:16:27.600 --> 01:16:29.523
...the black-haired archer...

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.962
...we stuck him with a Morgul shaft.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.769
The poison's in his blood. He'll be...

01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:38.047
...choking on it soon.

01:16:38.840 --> 01:16:40.649
Answer the question, filth.

01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:47.769
I would not antagonize her.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.169
You like killing things, Orc?

01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:52.845
You like death?

01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:55.280
Then let me give it to you.

01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:12.760
I do not care about one...

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:15.645
...dead Dwarf. Answer the question.

01:17:16.160 --> 01:17:19.209
You have nothing to fear. Tell us...

01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:21.960
...what you know
and I will set you free.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.921
You had orders to kill them. Why?

01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:27.362
What is Thorin Oakenshield to you?

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:30.490
The Dwarf runt will never be king.

01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:31.642
King?

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:34.963
There is no King Under the Mountain,
nor will there ever be.

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:37.487
None would dare enter Erebor...

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:38.800
...whilst the dragon lives.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.650
You know nothing.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.526
Your world will burn.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:45.404
What are you talking about?

01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:47.126
Speak!

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.370
Our time has come again.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.288
My master serves the One.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:58.206
Do you understand now, Elfling?

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.323
Death is upon you.

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:02.767
The flames of war...

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.650
...are upon you.

01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:08.767
Why did you do that?

01:18:09.280 --> 01:18:11.123
You promised to set him free.

01:18:11.360 --> 01:18:12.486
And I did.

01:18:13.520 --> 01:18:16.763
I freed his wretched head
from his miserable shoulders.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:18.963
There was more...

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.964
...the Orc could tell us.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:23.647
There was nothing more he could tell me.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:27.080
What did he mean by "the flames of war"?

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.047
It means they intend to
unleash a weapon so great...

01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.442
...it will destroy all before it.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:36.522
I want the watch doubled at our borders.
All roads, all rivers.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.524
Nothing moves, but I hear of it.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.285
No one enters this kingdom.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:42.965
And no one leaves it.

01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:09.009
Watch out!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:18.803
What are you trying...

01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.730
...to do, drown us?

01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:23.571
I was born and bred on these waters,
Master Dwarf.

01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:25.211
If I wanted to drown you...

01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:27.044
...I would not do it here.

01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:31.521
Oh, I've had enough of this lippy Lakeman.

01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:34.531
I say we throw him over the side
and be done with it.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.246
- Bard, his name's Bard.
- How do you know?

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:39.251
Uh, I asked him.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.091
I don't care what he calls himself.
I don't like him.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.890
We do not have to like him.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.770
We simply have to pay him.

01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:47.809
Come on now, lads. Turn out...

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:49.007
...your pockets.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.850
How do we know he won't betray us?

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:53.320
We don't.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:54.960
There's...

01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:56.367
...just a wee problem.

01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.045
We're 10 coins short.

01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:01.849
Gloin.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.083
Come on.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:06.448
- Give us what you have.
- Don't look to me.

01:21:07.520 --> 01:21:09.887
I have been bled dry...

01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.201
...by this venture.

01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:12.487
What have I seen...

01:21:12.760 --> 01:21:14.046
...for my investment?

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:16.644
Naught but misery and...

01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:17.767
...grief and...

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.088
Bless my beard.

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.081
Take it.

01:21:31.200 --> 01:21:32.611
- Take all of it.
- Ahem.

01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:37.775
The money, quick. Give it to me.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:38.528
We will pay you when we...

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.489
...get our provisions but not before.

01:21:40.720 --> 01:21:43.200
If you value your freedom,
you'll do as I say.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.926
There are guards ahead.

01:22:03.480 --> 01:22:04.845
What's he doing?

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.440
He's talking to someone.

01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:10.121
He's pointing right at us.

01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.089
Now they're...

01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.040
...shaking hands.

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.645
- What?
- The villain.

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:18.211
He's selling us out.

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.122
Quiet.

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:46.649
We're approaching the tollgate.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:58.842
Halt!

01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.491
Goods inspection!

01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:03.083
Papers, please!

01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.080
Oh, it's you, Bard.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.367
Morning, Percy.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.806
Anything to declare?

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.811
Nothing, but that I am cold and tired...

01:23:11.080 --> 01:23:12.127
...and ready for home.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.600
You and me both.

01:23:17.720 --> 01:23:19.131
There we are.

01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:20.202
All in order.

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:23.284
Not so fast.

01:23:24.480 --> 01:23:27.768
"Consignment of empty barrels
from the Woodland Realm."

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:29.968
Only...

01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.770
...they're not empty...

01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.806
...are they, Bard?

01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.007
If I recall correctly...

01:23:37.280 --> 01:23:39.567
...you're licensed as a bargeman.

01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:41.442
Not...

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:44.200
...a fisherman.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.925
That's none of your business.

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.607
Wrong.

01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:51.287
It's the Master's business,
which makes it my business.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:54.091
Oh, come on, Alfrid, have a heart.
People need to eat.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.561
These fish are illegal.

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.175
Empty the barrels...

01:23:58.200 --> 01:24:00.407
...over the side.
- You heard him. In the canal.

01:24:02.480 --> 01:24:04.448
Come on. Get a move on.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:06.484
Folk in this town are struggling.

01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:08.246
Times are hard.

01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:09.487
Food is scarce.

01:24:09.720 --> 01:24:10.846
That's not my problem.

01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:13.128
And when the people hear
the Master is dumping fish...

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.970
...back in the lake...

01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:17.090
...when the rioting starts...

01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.285
...will it be your problem then?

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:27.361
Stop.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:31.960
Ever the people's champion...

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.202
...eh, Bard? Protector of...

01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:35.248
...the common folk.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:37.175
You might have their favor now,
bargeman...

01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:38.167
...but it won't last.

01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.486
Raise the gate!

01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:48.529
The Master has his eye on you.

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.250
You'd do well to remember:

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.045
We know where you live.

01:24:52.280 --> 01:24:53.964
It's a small town, Alfrid.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:56.728
Everyone knows where everyone lives.

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.201
All this talk of civil unrest.

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.124
Someone's been stirring the pot, sire.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:21.761
Gout playing up, sire?

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:22.967
It's the damp.

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:24.600
It's the only possible explanation.

01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.041
Get me a brandy.

01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:29.730
The mood of the people, sire,
it's turning ugly.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:32.930
They're commoners, Alfrid.
They've always been ugly.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.800
It's not my fault they live in a place...

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.691
...that stinks of fish oil and tar.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.370
Jobs, shelter, food.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:43.250
It's all they ever bleat about.

01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.121
It's my belief, sire, they are
being led on by troublemakers.

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:49.805
Then we must find these...

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.003
...troublemakers and arrest them.

01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:54.163
My thoughts exactly, sire.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:57.244
And all this talk of change
must be suppressed.

01:25:57.480 --> 01:25:59.767
Can't afford to let the rabble
band together...

01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.800
...and start making noises.
The next thing...

01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:04.884
...you know, they'll start
asking questions...

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.724
...forming committees...

01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:09.125
...launching inquiries.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.840
Out with the old, in with the new?

01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.527
What?

01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.808
That's what they've been saying, sire.

01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.007
There is even talk...

01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:18.480
...of an election.

01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:19.926
An election? Heh.

01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:21.491
That's absurd.

01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:23.722
I won't stand for it. Ha!

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:26.761
I don't think they'd ask you to stand, sire.

01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:30.210
Shirkers.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:31.362
Ingrates.

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:32.647
Rabble-rousers.

01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:35.611
Who would have the nerve
to question my authority?

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:37.525
Who would dare?

01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:38.761
Who...?

01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:45.045
Bard.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.450
You mark my words:

01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.324
That trouble-making bargeman...

01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:51.164
...is behind all this.

01:26:51.400 --> 01:26:52.208
No one else would have the...

01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:53.089
Bollocks...

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.048
...sire.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:58.640
Ram and goat,
sautÃ©ed in a lovely little mushroom gravy.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:03.240
In an ideal world, sire, we'd arrest him.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.690
But Bard has the favor of the people.

01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:09.446
They see him as a leader.

01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:13.361
Someone they can truly admire.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.840
Modest...

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:16.645
...intelligent...

01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.006
...handsome...

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:19.605
...athletic...

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:23.447
Yes, he's clearly modeling himself on me.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:25.762
That's no crime.

01:27:27.240 --> 01:27:28.526
I wonder...

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:34.246
I wonder if some ancient law might exist...

01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.530
...that forbids bargemen
from asking questions.

01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:44.125
You think such a venerable statute
might exist?

01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:48.531
Almost certainly, sire.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:53.565
I'll write one immediately.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:00.407
You picked the wrong man...

01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:03.450
...to tangle with, Master Bard.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:05.689
I hope you're watching yourself...

01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.564
<i>...because I'll be watching you.</i>

01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:17.761
Get your hands off me.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.120
You didn't see them.
They were never here.

01:28:28.800 --> 01:28:30.404
The fish you can have for nothing.

01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:34.883
Stay close.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.606
Follow me.

01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:40.762
What is this place?

01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:43.884
This, Mr. Baggins, is the world of Men.

01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.406
Get it over here now.

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:47.642
Grab the other end. That's it.

01:28:48.680 --> 01:28:50.091
Keep your head's down, keep moving.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:51.287
Quickly, now.

01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:54.444
God, how many more are there?

01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.483
Halt.

01:28:57.560 --> 01:28:58.288
Oi!

01:28:58.560 --> 01:28:59.129
Come on. Move.

01:28:59.360 --> 01:28:59.963
In the name...

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:00.849
...of the Master of Lake-town...

01:29:01.080 --> 01:29:01.683
...I said halt.

01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:03.289
Halt!

01:29:04.600 --> 01:29:05.283
Stop them!

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:07.848
- Get back.
- Come here.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.565
What's going on here?

01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:37.167
Stay where you are. Nobody leaves.

01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:46.568
Braga.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:47.847
- Sorry?
- You.

01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:51.086
What are you up to, Bard?

01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:52.088
Me?

01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:53.367
Nothing.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.965
I'm looking for nothing.

01:29:58.480 --> 01:29:59.163
Yeah.

01:30:05.680 --> 01:30:07.444
Hey, Braga.

01:30:09.040 --> 01:30:10.690
Your wife would look lovely in this.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:14.131
What do you know of my wife?

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:17.324
I know her as well
as any man in this town.

01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.361
Da!

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.649
Our house, it's being watched.

01:31:12.080 --> 01:31:13.411
You can tell the Master
I'm done...

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:14.289
...for the day.

01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:18.087
Da! Where have you been?

01:31:18.360 --> 01:31:21.330
Father! There you are! I was worried.

01:31:21.680 --> 01:31:23.091
Here, Sigrid.

01:31:23.640 --> 01:31:24.607
Bain, get them in.

01:31:32.360 --> 01:31:34.966
If you speak of this to anyone...

01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.645
...I'll rip your arms off.

01:31:39.520 --> 01:31:41.010
Get off.

01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.521
Up there.

01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.088
Da...

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.601
...why are there Dwarves
climbing out of our toilet?

01:31:54.840 --> 01:31:56.171
Will they bring us luck?

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:01.602
They may not be the best fit...

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.604
...but they'll keep you warm.

01:32:04.280 --> 01:32:05.327
Thank you very much.

01:32:15.520 --> 01:32:17.602
A Dwarvish windlance.

01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.489
You look like...

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.046
...you've seen a ghost.

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:21.961
He has.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:23.761
The last time we saw...

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.684
...such a weapon...

01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:27.607
...a city was on fire.

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.881
It was the day the dragon came.

01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:36.610
<i>The day that Smaug...</i>

01:32:36.840 --> 01:32:37.966
<i>...destroyed Dale.</i>

01:32:40.440 --> 01:32:42.647
<i>Girion, the Lord of the City...</i>

01:32:42.880 --> 01:32:43.855
<i>...rallied his bowmen...</i>

01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.006
<i>...to fire upon the beast.</i>

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.889
But a dragon's hide is tough.

01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:50.642
Tougher than the strongest armor.

01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:54.089
Only a Black Arrow fired from a windlance...

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.924
...could have pierced the dragon's hide.

01:32:56.880 --> 01:32:57.927
<i>And few of those...</i>

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.969
<i>...arrows were ever made.</i>

01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:06.406
<i>The store was running low...</i>

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:07.600
<i>...when Girion...</i>

01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:08.680
<i>...made his last stand.</i>

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.122
Had the aim of Men been true that day...

01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.563
...much would have been different.

01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.603
You speak as if you were there.

01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:32.088
All Dwarves know the tale.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.607
Then you would know
that Girion hit the dragon.

01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.729
He loosened a scale under the left wing.

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.240
One more shot and
he would have killed the beast.

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.089
That's a fairy story, lad.

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:43.731
Nothing more.

01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:46.085
You took our money.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.446
Where are the weapons?

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:52.246
Wait here.

01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:07.448
Tomorrow begins...

01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.760
...the last days of autumn.

01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.207
Durin's Day falls the mom after next.

01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:13.363
We must reach the mountain before then.

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:14.965
And if we do not?

01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.521
If we fail to find the hidden door
before that time?

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.295
Then this quest has been for nothing.

01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:32.806
What is this?

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.646
Pike hook.

01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:36.041
Made from an old harpoon.

01:34:36.640 --> 01:34:38.802
- And this?
- A crowbill, we call it.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:40.610
Fashioned from a smithy's hammer.

01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:42.365
It's heavy in hand, I grant...

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:45.365
...but in defense of your life,
these will serve you better than none.

01:34:45.600 --> 01:34:46.362
We paid...

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.329
...you for weapons.

01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:50.130
Iron-forged swords...

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:51.361
...and axes!

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:52.567
It's a joke!

01:34:54.680 --> 01:34:55.575
You won't find...

01:34:55.600 --> 01:34:57.250
...better outside the city armory.

01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:58.845
All iron-forged weapons are held there...

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.326
...under lock and key.

01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:01.607
Thorin...

01:35:02.240 --> 01:35:02.968
...why not take what's...

01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.122
...on offer and go?

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:05.566
I've made do with less.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:06.602
So have you.

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.122
- I say we leave now.
- You're not going anywhere.

01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.282
What did you say?

01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:13.800
There are spies watching this house...

01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.725
...and probably every dock
and wharf in the town.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:17.969
You must wait...

01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.122
...till nightfall.

01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:36.761
Thorin.

01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:50.926
Da?

01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.565
Don't let them leave.

01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:28.681
Tauriel...

01:36:29.480 --> 01:36:31.528
...you cannot hunt 30 Orcs...

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:32.687
...on your own.

01:36:32.920 --> 01:36:34.809
But I'm not on my own.

01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:36.926
You knew I would come.

01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:40.368
The king is angry...

01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.449
...Tauriel. For 600 years...

01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:44.409
...my father has protected you,
favored you.

01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:46.885
You defied his orders.

01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.531
You betrayed his trust.

01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:00.090
The king has never let Orc filth...

01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:01.287
...roam our lands.

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:04.808
Yet he would let this Orc pack cross
our borders and kill our prisoners.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.366
It is not our fight.

01:37:06.600 --> 01:37:08.125
It is our fight.

01:37:08.640 --> 01:37:10.369
It will not end here.

01:37:10.600 --> 01:37:13.490
With every victory, this evil will grow.

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:16.491
If your father has his way,
we will do nothing.

01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.842
We will hide within our walls...

01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:21.401
...live our lives away from the light...

01:37:21.680 --> 01:37:23.205
...and let darkness descend.

01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.969
Are we not part of this world?

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.366
Tell me, mellon.

01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:33.082
When did we let evil
become stronger than us?

01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:40.691
Hello, Bard. What you after?

01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:43.290
There was a tapestry!

01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.128
An old one! Where's it gone?

01:37:46.360 --> 01:37:47.640
What tapestry you talking about?

01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:48.489
This one.

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.084
They were Dwarves, I tell you.
Appeared...

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.162
...out of nowhere.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.562
Full beards. Fierce eyes.

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.444
I've never seen the like.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:58.802
What are Dwarves doing in these parts?

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.720
- It's the prophecy.
- The prophecy?

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.689
The Prophecy of Durin's Folk.

01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:13.525
Prophecy.

01:38:17.280 --> 01:38:18.361
Prophecy.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:19.886
The old tales will come true.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:22.401
Vast halls of treasure!

01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.802
Silver and gold and jewels beyond measure.

01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:26.047
Can you imagine?

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.441
Can it really be true?

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:30.411
Has the lord of silver fountains returned?

01:38:30.720 --> 01:38:33.291
<i>The lord of the silver fountains</i>

01:38:33.520 --> 01:38:35.807
<i>The King of carven stone</i>

01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:39.644
<i>The King beneath the mountain</i>

01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:42.763
<i>Shall come into his own!</i>

01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.969
<i>And the bell shall ring in gladness</i>

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:46.803
<i>At the Mountain</i>

01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.565
<i>King's return</i>

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:51.531
<i>But all shall fail in sadness</i>

01:38:52.200 --> 01:38:54.851
<i>And the lake will shine and burn</i>

01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:58.840
Da, I tried to stop them.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:00.485
How long have they been gone?

01:39:04.600 --> 01:39:06.284
- Can you see anything?
- Shh! Keep it down.

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:07.681
As soon as we have the weapons...

01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:09.485
...we make straight for the mountain.

01:39:09.720 --> 01:39:10.926
Go, go!

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.481
Go, Nori.

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:16.601
Next.

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:22.888
<i>Prophecy?</i>

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.528
Who dragged up that old nonsense?

01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:27.489
People, sire.

01:39:27.720 --> 01:39:28.721
They're gathering in the streets.

01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:32.043
They're saying that a king will return
to the Lonely Mountain...

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:36.001
...and that the rivers will once more
run with gold.

01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:38.567
Rivers of gold? Poppycock.

01:39:40.600 --> 01:39:41.601
As you say, sire.

01:39:42.720 --> 01:39:44.680
But people will believe
what they want to believe.

01:39:45.680 --> 01:39:48.286
It's been a long time
since they've seen any riches.

01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.922
The old tales offer them hope.

01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:02.881
You all right?

01:40:03.120 --> 01:40:04.406
I can manage.

01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.764
Let's just get out of here.

01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:21.647
Run!

01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.006
Quickly! Move now!

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.366
Get off me! Get off!

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.204
Move them along here.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:42.321
Move on!

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.450
What is the meaning of this?

01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:55.807
We caught them stealing weapons, sire.

01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:58.321
Ah. Enemies of the state, eh?

01:40:58.560 --> 01:40:59.368
A desperate bunch of...

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.762
...mercenaries, if ever there was, sire.

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.240
Hold your tongue!

01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.922
You do not know to whom you speak.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.409
This is no common criminal.

01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.045
This is Thorin...

01:41:12.280 --> 01:41:15.409
...son of Thrain, son of Thror!

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:20.642
We are the Dwarves of Erebor.

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:26.523
We have come to reclaim our homeland.

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.244
I remember this town
in the great days of old.

01:41:35.560 --> 01:41:37.608
Fleets of boats lay at harbor...

01:41:37.840 --> 01:41:39.251
...filled with silks and fine gems.

01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:42.847
This was no forsaken town on a lake.

01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:46.565
This was the center of all trade
in the North!

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:48.969
I would...

01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:50.446
...see those days return.

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:53.206
I would relight the great forges
of the Dwarves...

01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:54.407
...and send wealth and riches...

01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:57.120
...flowing once more
from the Halls of Erebor!

01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:00.689
Death!

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:02.921
That is what you will...

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.446
...bring upon us!

01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:07.004
Dragon fire and ruin.

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.369
If you waken that beast...

01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:13.604
...it will destroy us all.

01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:15.683
You can listen to this naysayer...

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:17.570
...but I promise you this:

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.405
If we succeed...

01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.286
...all will share in the wealth
of the mountain.

01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:32.729
You will have enough gold
to rebuild Esgaroth...

01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:34.206
...10 times over!

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.842
Why should we take you at your word?

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.730
We know nothing about you.

01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.160
Who here can vouch for your character?

01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.682
Me.

01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:03.962
I'll vouch for him.

01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:07.126
I have traveled far...

01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:09.482
...with these Dwarves
through great danger...

01:43:09.720 --> 01:43:12.963
...and if Thorin Oakenshield...

01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:14.366
...gives his word...

01:43:15.320 --> 01:43:17.482
...then he will keep it.

01:43:20.280 --> 01:43:21.441
All of you!

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.921
Listen to me!

01:43:23.160 --> 01:43:24.207
You must listen!

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:26.169
Have you forgotten
what happened to Dale?

01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:29.135
Have you forgotten those...

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:31.208
...who died in the firestorm?!

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:34.402
And for what purpose?

01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.729
The blind ambition of a Mountain King...

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.602
...so riven by greed, he could not...

01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:42.365
...see beyond his own desire!

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.204
Now, now!

01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:47.488
We must not, any of us...

01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.087
...be too quick to lay blame.

01:43:51.240 --> 01:43:51.809
Let us...

01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.769
...not forget that it was...

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:55.809
...Girion, Lord of Dale...

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:57.730
...your ancestor...

01:43:58.000 --> 01:44:00.480
...who failed to kill the beast!

01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.008
It's true, sire.

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.446
We all know the story.

01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:09.724
Arrow after arrow, he shot.

01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:12.531
Each one missing its mark.

01:44:19.280 --> 01:44:20.566
You have no right.

01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:24.163
No right to enter that mountain.

01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:28.008
I have the only right.

01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:35.725
I speak to the Master...

01:44:35.960 --> 01:44:37.450
...of the Men of the Lake.

01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:40.001
Will you see the prophecy fulfilled?

01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:41.927
Will you...

01:44:42.280 --> 01:44:46.046
...share in the great wealth
of our people?

01:44:51.040 --> 01:44:52.485
What say you?

01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:59.409
I say unto you...

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.681
Welcome!

01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:02.883
Welcome!

01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:04.207
And thrice...

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:05.481
...welcome...

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.370
...King Under the Mountain!

01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:21.966
You do know we're one short.
Where's Bofur?

01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.806
- If he's not here, we leave him behind.
- We'll have to.

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:26.047
If we're to find the door before...

01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.851
...nightfall, we can risk no more delays.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:34.002
Not you.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.047
We must travel at speed.
You will slow us down.

01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:40.200
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you.

01:45:40.360 --> 01:45:41.282
Not now.

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:48.895
I'm going to be there
when that door is opened.

01:45:48.920 --> 01:45:51.160
When we first look upon
the Halls of our Fathers, Thorin.

01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:53.521
Kili, stay here.

01:45:54.120 --> 01:45:55.281
Rest.

01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.525
Join us when you're healed.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.451
I'll stay with the lad.

01:46:04.680 --> 01:46:06.489
My duty lies with the wounded.

01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.687
Uncle.

01:46:08.560 --> 01:46:10.289
We grew up on tales of the mountain.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:11.806
Tales you told us.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:13.175
You cannot take that away...

01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:14.201
...from him!
- Fili.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:15.520
I will carry him if I must!

01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:18.161
One day you will be king
and you will understand.

01:46:18.920 --> 01:46:22.208
I cannot risk the fate of this quest
for the sake of one Dwarf.

01:46:23.520 --> 01:46:25.284
Not even my own kin.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:29.840
Fili, don't be a fool.

01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:31.920
You belong with the company.

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.690
I belong with my brother.

01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.046
By my beard, is that the time?! Ah!

01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.169
Go now with our goodwill...

01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:54.811
...and good wishes.

01:46:56.120 --> 01:46:58.930
- And may your return bring good fortune...
- Wait!

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.286
...to all!

01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:05.767
Good bye.

01:47:12.240 --> 01:47:12.843
Out of the way!

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.445
No! No!

01:47:21.040 --> 01:47:23.088
Ha. So you missed the boat as well?

01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.881
Kili? Kili!

01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.725
Hey.

01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.889
Get out of there. Go on.

01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.324
Masterfully handled, sire.

01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:35.528
Your popularity has never been so high.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.723
The entire town twittering your name.

01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:39.803
Yes, it was rather clever.

01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:42.202
Either our little friends return triumphant...

01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:45.410
...in which case,
I stand to make a pretty penny...

01:47:45.680 --> 01:47:48.763
...or old Smaug dines on Dwarf
for a day or two.

01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.649
The important thing is,
they're off our hands.

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.642
Please, wait.

01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:55.286
Please. We need your help.

01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:57.090
- My brother is sick.
- Sick?

01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.600
Is it infectious?

01:47:58.840 --> 01:47:59.568
Get back.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:01.370
Alfrid, Alfrid...

01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:02.647
- ...don't let them come any closer.
- Please.

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.124
We need medicine.

01:48:06.480 --> 01:48:08.164
Do I look like an apothecary?

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.006
Haven't we given you enough?

01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:11.401
The master's a busy man.

01:48:11.640 --> 01:48:14.484
He hasn't got time to worry
about sick Dwarves.

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:16.127
Be gone with you. Go on.

01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:17.646
Clear off.

01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:21.003
What this town needs,
Alfrid, is a good purge.

01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:25.165
Starting with a certain troublemaker
who saw fit to question my authority.

01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:28.131
- A certain bargeman, sire?
- Precisely.

01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:31.721
No.

01:48:31.960 --> 01:48:33.610
I'm done with Dwarves. Go away.

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:34.443
No, no...

01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.488
...no! Please!

01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:38.286
No one will help us. Kili's sick.

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:41.961
He's very sick.

01:49:21.320 --> 01:49:23.482
So quiet.

01:49:23.720 --> 01:49:26.724
Wasn't always like this.

01:49:26.960 --> 01:49:32.126
Once, these slopes
were lined with woodlands.

01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:33.566
The trees...

01:49:33.800 --> 01:49:36.121
...were filled with birdsong.

01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:41.406
Relax, Master Baggins.

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:46.280
We have food, we have tools,
and we're making good time.

01:49:59.640 --> 01:50:01.290
What is this place?

01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:02.960
It was once the city of Dale.

01:50:04.800 --> 01:50:06.484
Now it is a ruin.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:09.447
The desolation of Smaug.

01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:11.603
The sun will soon reach midday.

01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:14.335
We must find the hidden door
into the mountain before it sets.

01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:15.202
This way.

01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:17.488
Wait. Is this the overlook?

01:50:17.800 --> 01:50:19.165
Gandalf said to meet him here.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.240
- On no account were we to...
- Do you see him?

01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:22.400
We have no time...

01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:24.011
...to wait upon the Wizard.

01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:26.044
We're on our own. Come!

01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:44.924
Dol Guldur.

01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:47.362
The Hill of Sorcery.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.841
It looks completely abandoned.

01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.565
As it is meant to.

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.045
A spell of concealment...

01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:57.363
...lies over this place, which means...

01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:00.683
...our Enemy is not yet ready
to reveal himself.

01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:06.008
He has not regained his full strength.

01:51:06.440 --> 01:51:09.808
Radagast, I need you to carry
a message to the Lady Galadriel.

01:51:10.040 --> 01:51:12.247
Tell her we must force his hand.

01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:13.561
What do you mean?

01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.370
I'm going in alone.

01:51:15.720 --> 01:51:18.121
On no account come after me.

01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.566
Do I have your word?

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:27.802
Yes, yes, yes!

01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:41.010
Wait, Gandalf!

01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.083
What if it's a trap?!

01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:48.925
Turn around and do not come back.

01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:56.644
It's undoubtedly a trap.

01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:40.728
Anything?

01:52:40.960 --> 01:52:42.883
Nothing.

01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:47.601
If the map is true...

01:52:48.560 --> 01:52:51.325
...the hidden door lies directly above us.

01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:57.489
Up here!

01:53:05.640 --> 01:53:08.291
You have keen eyes, Mr. Baggins.

01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:10.882
Thrain?

01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:14.360
Son of Thror?

01:56:16.840 --> 01:56:18.490
My old friend.

01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:22.808
Gandalf?

01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.767
A lifetime.

01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:37.246
I have been here a lifetime.

01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:38.925
I'm so sorry...

01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:41.049
...I gave you up for dead.

01:56:43.360 --> 01:56:45.931
I had a son.

01:56:47.720 --> 01:56:49.404
I will fight with you.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.527
Thorin.

01:56:56.760 --> 01:56:59.969
And you will see him again, my friend.

01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:02.288
Come, we must leave.

01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:04.921
The Orcs had taken Moria.

01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:07.362
War. We were at war.

01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:12.087
I was surrounded.

01:57:14.360 --> 01:57:15.725
The Defiler.

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:20.403
Azog the Defiler...

01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.802
...had come.

01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:12.682
They took it.

01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:15.127
The last of the seven.

01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:20.360
Come on, let's get you out of here.

01:58:22.480 --> 01:58:23.402
There is no way out.

01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:26.648
They will stop you.

01:58:26.880 --> 01:58:27.722
The serpents...

01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:30.327
...will stop you.

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:34.721
It's an illusion.

01:58:37.600 --> 01:58:39.489
Just an illusion.

01:58:42.800 --> 01:58:44.643
What have they done to you?

01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:45.921
I never told them.

01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:49.164
They tried to make me,
but I never said a word.

01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:55.805
Have you kept them safe, Gandalf?
The map and the key?

01:58:56.760 --> 01:58:57.921
I gave them to Thorin.

01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.280
You'd be proud of him.

01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:01.887
He's taken up the quest to reclaim Erebor.

01:59:02.120 --> 01:59:02.803
Erebor.

01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:05.285
He will retrieve the Arkenstone.

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:06.880
The seven armies of the Dwarves...

01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:07.887
...will answer...

01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.525
...to a new king.
- No. No.

01:59:09.760 --> 01:59:11.922
Thorin must not go near Erebor.

01:59:13.400 --> 01:59:16.210
No one must enter that mountain.

01:59:47.720 --> 01:59:48.801
This must be it.

01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:52.525
The hidden door.

01:59:56.760 --> 01:59:58.524
Let all those who doubted us...

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:01.045
...rue this day!

02:00:06.760 --> 02:00:09.206
Right, then. We have a key.

02:00:10.920 --> 02:00:12.410
Which means that somewhere...

02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:14.931
...there is a key-hole.

02:00:15.640 --> 02:00:18.530
"The last light of Durin's Day...

02:00:20.520 --> 02:00:21.360
...will shine upon...

02:00:21.600 --> 02:00:23.011
...the key-hole."

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:33.241
Nori.

02:00:39.840 --> 02:00:41.808
We're losing the light. Come on.

02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.926
Be quiet! I can't hear when you're thumping.

02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:51.968
I can't find it.

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:54.765
It's not here!

02:00:55.000 --> 02:00:56.081
It's not here!

02:00:57.840 --> 02:00:59.200
- Break it down!
- Aye.

02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:01.728
Come on!

02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:04.642
Break!

02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.881
It has to break.

02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.171
It's no good.

02:01:08.440 --> 02:01:10.920
The door's sealed. Can't be opened by force.

02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:13.800
There's a powerful magic on it.

02:01:23.320 --> 02:01:24.446
No!

02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:32.087
"The last light of Durin's Day...

02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:35.530
...will shine upon the key-hole."

02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:41.564
That is what it says.

02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:47.485
What did we miss?

02:01:51.440 --> 02:01:52.885
What did we miss?

02:01:53.920 --> 02:01:54.887
Balin?

02:01:55.520 --> 02:01:57.249
We've lost the light.

02:01:59.760 --> 02:02:01.603
There's no more to be done.

02:02:03.160 --> 02:02:03.729
We had but...

02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:05.240
...one chance.

02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:08.926
Come away, lads.

02:02:09.160 --> 02:02:10.969
It's over.

02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:14.168
- Wait a minute.
- We're too late.

02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.091
Where are they going?

02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.769
You can't give up now!

02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:37.841
Thorin.

02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:41.564
You can't give up now.

02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.487
"Stand by the gray stone...

02:02:57.360 --> 02:02:59.442
...when the thrush knocks."

02:03:00.200 --> 02:03:01.611
The setting sun.

02:03:02.640 --> 02:03:05.530
And "the last light of Durin's Day
will shine..."

02:03:07.000 --> 02:03:08.490
The last light.

02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:12.411
Last light.

02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:50.320
The last light!

02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.686
The key-hole!

02:04:02.200 --> 02:04:02.769
Come back!

02:04:03.560 --> 02:04:04.891
Come back!

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:07.322
It's the light of the moon! The last...

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:10.643
...moon of autumn! Ha, ha, ha!

02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:14.961
Where's the key? Where's the key?
Where's the...?

02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:16.929
It was here.

02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:18.969
Come on, it was... It was here.

02:04:19.680 --> 02:04:20.488
It was just...

02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:19.965
Erebor.

02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:21.806
Thorin.

02:05:35.200 --> 02:05:37.089
I know these walls.

02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:42.365
These halls.

02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:46.771
This stone.

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:51.400
You remember it...

02:05:51.560 --> 02:05:52.686
...Balin.

02:05:56.280 --> 02:05:58.806
Chambers filled with golden light.

02:06:00.680 --> 02:06:02.170
I remember.

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:16.771
"Herein lies...

02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:18.929
...the Seventh Kingdom of...

02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:20.321
...Durin's Folk.

02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:25.363
May the Heart of the Mountain
unite all...

02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:29.207
...Dwarves in defense of this home."

02:06:30.920 --> 02:06:32.763
The Throne of the King.

02:06:33.400 --> 02:06:34.765
Ah.

02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:39.802
And what's that above it?

02:06:43.360 --> 02:06:45.089
The Arkenstone.

02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:47.811
Arkenstone.

02:06:51.720 --> 02:06:53.085
And what's that?

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:56.370
That, Master Burglar...

02:06:57.400 --> 02:06:59.448
...is why you are here.

02:07:18.320 --> 02:07:20.049
Can you not do something?

02:07:20.280 --> 02:07:22.521
I need herbs.
Something to bring down his fever.

02:07:22.760 --> 02:07:25.127
I have nightshade. I have feverfew.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.210
They're no use to me.
Do you have any kingsfoil?

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:30.442
No, it's a weed. We feed it to the pigs.

02:07:30.880 --> 02:07:32.006
Pigs?

02:07:32.280 --> 02:07:33.406
Weed.

02:07:34.160 --> 02:07:35.286
Right.

02:07:36.240 --> 02:07:37.401
Don't move.

02:07:40.200 --> 02:07:43.727
You want me to find a jewel?

02:07:45.280 --> 02:07:47.009
A large, white jewel.

02:07:47.440 --> 02:07:48.566
Yes.

02:07:49.960 --> 02:07:52.531
That's it? Only, I imagine
there's quite a few down there.

02:07:52.880 --> 02:07:56.089
There is only one Arkenstone...

02:07:56.840 --> 02:07:58.922
...and you'll know it when you see it.

02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.166
Right.

02:08:04.920 --> 02:08:05.523
In truth...

02:08:05.760 --> 02:08:06.647
...lad...

02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:09.488
...I do not know...

02:08:09.720 --> 02:08:11.802
...what you will find down there.

02:08:13.920 --> 02:08:17.083
You needn't go if you don't want to.
There's no dishonor in turning back.

02:08:17.320 --> 02:08:18.287
No, Balin.

02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.568
I promised I would do this...

02:08:22.240 --> 02:08:23.969
...and I think I must try.

02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:30.369
It never ceases to amaze me.

02:08:30.600 --> 02:08:31.408
What's that?

02:08:31.680 --> 02:08:33.364
The courage of Hobbits.

02:08:35.760 --> 02:08:37.000
Go now...

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:41.525
...with as much luck as you can muster.

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:50.006
Oh, Bilbo?

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:54.727
If there is, in fact...

02:08:56.240 --> 02:08:57.082
...a live dragon...

02:08:57.320 --> 02:08:58.367
...down there...

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:02.811
...don't waken it.

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:25.081
He is waiting for them.

02:09:25.360 --> 02:09:26.600
They are in league.

02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:29.923
The dragon and the One.

02:09:30.160 --> 02:09:31.571
Hurry. We must hurry.

02:09:54.040 --> 02:09:55.485
Where is your master?

02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:58.361
Where is he?!

02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:55.250
He is here.

02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:00.087
Tell Thorin...

02:11:01.320 --> 02:11:03.402
...that I loved him.

02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:04.801
Will you do that?

02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:08.721
Will you tell my son that I loved him?

02:11:09.000 --> 02:11:11.128
You will tell him yourself.

02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:14.570
It is too late.

02:12:38.160 --> 02:12:40.970
Sauron!

02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:04.641
Hello?

02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:25.091
He's not at home.

02:13:26.040 --> 02:13:27.724
Not at home. Ahem.

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:29.641
Good.

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.169
Good, good, good.

02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:27.929
What's that?

02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.008
Shush. Shush.

02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:36.606
Arkenstone.

02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:39.051
Arkenstone.

02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:41.928
A large, white jewel.

02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:45.485
Very helpful.

02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:12.491
Well...

02:17:14.160 --> 02:17:15.446
...thief.

02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:21.081
I smell you.

02:17:21.440 --> 02:17:24.648
I hear your breath.

02:17:25.959 --> 02:17:27.564
I feel...

02:17:27.840 --> 02:17:28.762
...your air.

02:17:32.680 --> 02:17:35.206
Where are you?

02:17:36.680 --> 02:17:37.761
Where are you?

02:17:57.879 --> 02:17:58.880
Come, now...

02:17:59.639 --> 02:18:01.768
...don't be shy.

02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:04.246
Step into the light.

02:18:08.440 --> 02:18:09.043
Hmm.

02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:14.369
There is something about you.

02:18:17.760 --> 02:18:18.567
Something you...

02:18:18.799 --> 02:18:19.642
...carry.

02:18:20.799 --> 02:18:23.690
Something made of gold.

02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:27.364
But far more...

02:18:27.600 --> 02:18:29.409
...precious.

02:18:29.639 --> 02:18:31.960
<i>Precious! Precious!</i>

02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:35.921
There you are...

02:18:36.200 --> 02:18:37.725
...Thief in the...

02:18:37.959 --> 02:18:39.803
...Shadows.

02:18:41.639 --> 02:18:44.245
I did not come to steal from you...

02:18:44.480 --> 02:18:45.288
...O Smaug...

02:18:45.520 --> 02:18:48.763
...the Unassessably Wealthy.
I merely wanted...

02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:50.644
...to gaze upon your magnificence.

02:18:51.000 --> 02:18:51.842
To see...

02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:55.049
...if you really were as great
as the old tales say.

02:18:55.760 --> 02:18:57.489
I did not believe them.

02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:10.245
And do you now?!

02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:12.840
Truly...

02:19:14.160 --> 02:19:16.367
...the tales and songs...

02:19:17.480 --> 02:19:20.210
...fall utterly short of your enormity...

02:19:20.440 --> 02:19:23.410
...O Smaug the Stupendous.

02:19:23.639 --> 02:19:26.530
Do you think flattery will keep you alive?

02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:28.007
No, no.

02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:29.730
No, indeed.

02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:35.243
You seem familiar with my name...

02:19:35.480 --> 02:19:38.370
...but I don't remember smelling
your kind before.

02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:41.084
Who are you...

02:19:41.320 --> 02:19:43.846
...and where do you come from...

02:19:44.080 --> 02:19:46.401
...may I ask?

02:19:55.960 --> 02:19:57.644
I come from under the hill.

02:19:58.000 --> 02:19:59.411
Underhill?

02:20:03.120 --> 02:20:04.120
And under hills...

02:20:04.240 --> 02:20:06.242
...and over hills my path has led.

02:20:07.120 --> 02:20:07.962
And... And...

02:20:08.720 --> 02:20:11.087
...through the air.
I am he who walks unseen.

02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:13.049
Impressive.

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:15.328
What else do you claim to be?

02:20:16.280 --> 02:20:17.088
I am...

02:20:20.320 --> 02:20:21.810
Luck-wearer.

02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:24.401
Riddle-maker.

02:20:24.680 --> 02:20:26.330
Lovely titles.

02:20:27.040 --> 02:20:28.201
Go on.

02:20:28.480 --> 02:20:29.561
Barrel-rider.

02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:33.202
Barrels? Now that is interesting.

02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:35.408
And what about...

02:20:35.640 --> 02:20:38.610
...your little Dwarf friends?

02:20:39.720 --> 02:20:40.960
Where are they hiding?

02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:45.410
Dwarves?

02:20:46.240 --> 02:20:47.321
No.

02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:49.525
No, no. No Dwarves here.

02:20:49.760 --> 02:20:50.841
You've got that all wrong.

02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:54.886
Oh, I don't think so, Barrel-rider!

02:20:55.440 --> 02:20:56.680
They sent you in here...

02:20:56.960 --> 02:20:58.928
...to do their dirty work while they...

02:20:59.160 --> 02:21:01.128
...skulk about outside.

02:21:02.360 --> 02:21:03.521
Truly...

02:21:04.320 --> 02:21:05.481
...you are mistaken...

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:08.764
...O Smaug, Chiefest
and Greatest of Calamities.

02:21:09.000 --> 02:21:12.402
You have nice manners...

02:21:12.640 --> 02:21:14.608
...for a thief and...

02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:15.762
...a liar!

02:21:17.120 --> 02:21:20.522
I know the smell and taste of Dwarf.

02:21:20.960 --> 02:21:22.166
No one better!

02:21:23.880 --> 02:21:25.291
It is the gold!

02:21:25.520 --> 02:21:26.282
They are drawn...

02:21:26.520 --> 02:21:27.567
...to treasure like...

02:21:27.800 --> 02:21:29.370
...flies to dead flesh.

02:21:32.920 --> 02:21:34.160
Did you think I did not know...

02:21:34.600 --> 02:21:36.090
...this day would come?!

02:21:37.960 --> 02:21:39.246
That a pack of...

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.811
...canting Dwarves...

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:43.361
...would come crawling back...

02:21:43.920 --> 02:21:45.160
...to the mountain?!

02:21:49.720 --> 02:21:50.926
Was that an earthquake?

02:21:51.160 --> 02:21:53.288
That, my lad...

02:21:56.520 --> 02:21:57.965
...was a dragon.

02:22:06.280 --> 02:22:06.849
Da?

02:22:07.360 --> 02:22:08.964
It's coming from the mountain.

02:22:13.040 --> 02:22:14.280
You should leave us.

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:15.320
Take your children.

02:22:15.440 --> 02:22:16.327
Get out of here.

02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.286
And go where?

02:22:19.360 --> 02:22:20.771
There is nowhere to go.

02:22:22.720 --> 02:22:24.245
Are we going to die, Da?

02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:27.441
No, darling.

02:22:27.720 --> 02:22:28.440
The dragon.

02:22:28.560 --> 02:22:30.005
It's going to kill us.

02:22:40.680 --> 02:22:42.489
Not if I kill it first.

02:22:43.920 --> 02:22:47.606
The King Under the Mountain is dead.

02:22:47.840 --> 02:22:49.524
I took his throne.

02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:50.802
I ate his...

02:22:51.080 --> 02:22:53.845
...people like a wolf among sheep.

02:22:57.600 --> 02:22:58.761
I kill where...

02:22:59.040 --> 02:23:00.644
...I wish, when...

02:23:00.920 --> 02:23:02.365
...I wish.

02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:05.922
My armor is iron.

02:23:15.080 --> 02:23:17.526
No blade can pierce me.

02:23:20.680 --> 02:23:21.920
All right.

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:24.527
A Black Arrow? Why did you never tell me?

02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:26.410
Because you did not need to know.

02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:35.525
Listen to me carefully.

02:23:35.880 --> 02:23:38.042
I need you to distract the guards.

02:23:38.600 --> 02:23:39.203
Once I'm at the top of...

02:23:39.440 --> 02:23:41.727
...the tower, I'll set the arrow to the bow.

02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:42.760
There he is!

02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:43.409
Bard!

02:23:43.640 --> 02:23:45.847
- After him!
- Quickly! Down there. Go!

02:23:46.080 --> 02:23:46.720
Stop him!

02:23:54.120 --> 02:23:54.962
Stop him!

02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:56.409
Stop!

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:02.250
Bain! Bain.

02:24:03.080 --> 02:24:06.766
Keep it safe. Don't let anyone find it.
I'll deal with them.

02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.729
- I'm not leaving you.
- Now go!

02:24:12.680 --> 02:24:13.329
Braga.

02:24:13.560 --> 02:24:14.415
You're under arrest.

02:24:14.440 --> 02:24:17.330
- On what charge?
- Any charge the Master chooses.

02:24:47.320 --> 02:24:48.731
Where's he gone?

02:25:00.000 --> 02:25:01.081
What about Bilbo?

02:25:01.320 --> 02:25:02.321
Give him more time.

02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:04.722
Time to do what? To be killed?

02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:08.440
You're afraid.

02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:12.407
Yes, I'm afraid.

02:25:13.560 --> 02:25:14.925
I fear for you.

02:25:16.280 --> 02:25:18.442
A sickness lies upon that treasure hoard.

02:25:18.880 --> 02:25:19.895
A sickness which drove...

02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:21.206
...your grandfather mad.

02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:23.050
I am not my grandfather.

02:25:23.280 --> 02:25:25.044
You're not yourself.

02:25:25.920 --> 02:25:28.048
The Thorin I know would not hesitate
to go in there...

02:25:28.320 --> 02:25:28.889
I will not risk...

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:32.920
...this quest for the life of one burglar.

02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:36.245
Bilbo.

02:25:36.600 --> 02:25:38.523
His name is Bilbo.

02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:44.089
It's Oakenshield...

02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:47.330
...that filthy Dwarvish usurper.

02:25:49.560 --> 02:25:51.722
He sent you in here...

02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:54.725
...for the Arkenstone, didn't he?

02:25:54.960 --> 02:25:55.609
No. No...

02:25:55.840 --> 02:25:58.730
...no. I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:25:58.960 --> 02:26:00.086
Don't bother denying it.

02:26:01.480 --> 02:26:03.289
I guessed his foul purpose
some time ago.

02:26:05.880 --> 02:26:07.484
But it matters not.

02:26:08.640 --> 02:26:11.007
Oakenshield's quest will fail.

02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:14.764
The darkness is coming.

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.605
<i>It will spread to every corner of the land.</i>

02:27:02.200 --> 02:27:04.168
You are being used, Thief...

02:27:04.400 --> 02:27:06.528
...in the Shadows.
You were only...

02:27:06.760 --> 02:27:09.366
...ever a means to an end.

02:27:10.200 --> 02:27:10.803
The coward...

02:27:11.040 --> 02:27:13.611
...Oakenshield has weighed...

02:27:13.880 --> 02:27:15.450
...the value of your life...

02:27:15.720 --> 02:27:17.882
...and found it worth nothing.

02:27:18.480 --> 02:27:19.686
No.

02:27:20.400 --> 02:27:21.083
No.

02:27:22.360 --> 02:27:23.327
No, you're lying.

02:27:23.600 --> 02:27:24.761
What did he promise you?

02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:27.282
A share of the treasure?

02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:29.441
As if it was his...

02:27:29.680 --> 02:27:30.761
...to give.

02:27:31.600 --> 02:27:33.364
I will not part with...

02:27:33.600 --> 02:27:34.601
...a single coin.

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.806
Not one piece of it.

02:27:41.680 --> 02:27:42.567
My teeth...

02:27:42.800 --> 02:27:44.006
...are swords.

02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:48.202
My claws are spears.

02:27:50.320 --> 02:27:51.481
My Wings...

02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:54.646
...are a hurricane.

02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:02.123
So it is true.

02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:04.642
The Black Arrow found its mark.

02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:05.802
What did you say?

02:28:06.640 --> 02:28:10.531
I was just saying your reputation
precedes you, O Smaug...

02:28:10.760 --> 02:28:11.966
...the Tyrannical.

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:13.641
Truly.

02:28:13.880 --> 02:28:15.848
You have no equal on this earth.

02:28:20.280 --> 02:28:20.929
I am...

02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:24.443
...almost tempted to let you take it.

02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:26.882
If only to see Oakenshield...

02:28:27.160 --> 02:28:28.127
...suffer.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.281
Watch it...

02:28:30.520 --> 02:28:32.045
...destroy him.

02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:35.649
Watch it corrupt his heart...

02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:38.721
...and drive him mad.

02:28:41.920 --> 02:28:43.490
But I think not.

02:28:44.080 --> 02:28:46.321
I think our little game ends here.

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.400
So tell me...

02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:49.567
...thief...

02:28:50.440 --> 02:28:52.568
...how do you choose to die?

02:29:36.000 --> 02:29:36.842
Nah.

02:30:05.200 --> 02:30:07.248
Da? Is that you, Da?

02:30:40.360 --> 02:30:41.691
- Aah!
- Stay down!

02:31:42.520 --> 02:31:43.169
Get down!

02:32:19.720 --> 02:32:20.881
You killed them all.

02:32:21.120 --> 02:32:22.201
There are others.

02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:23.721
Tauriel.

02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:25.326
Come.

02:32:29.360 --> 02:32:30.327
We're losing him.

02:32:34.240 --> 02:32:35.446
Tauriel.

02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:00.361
Athelas.

02:33:03.200 --> 02:33:04.645
Athelas.

02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:06.721
What are you doing?

02:33:09.720 --> 02:33:11.449
I'm going to save him.

02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:33.735
- You're alive!
- Not for much longer.

02:33:33.760 --> 02:33:36.730
- Did you find the Arkenstone? The Arkenstone.
- The dragon's coming.

02:33:39.680 --> 02:33:41.250
Did you find it?

02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:47.841
We have to get out.

02:33:51.560 --> 02:33:52.561
Thorin.

02:33:56.280 --> 02:33:57.406
Thorin.

02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:29.968
You will burn!

02:34:31.120 --> 02:34:31.962
- Run!
- Ah!

02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:40.201
Come on, Bilbo!

02:34:53.080 --> 02:34:54.127
Come on.

02:35:11.280 --> 02:35:12.486
Hold him down.

02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:30.609
Unh! Tilda.

02:36:23.480 --> 02:36:24.686
Shh, Shh, Shh!

02:36:32.520 --> 02:36:33.965
We've given him the slip.

02:36:34.200 --> 02:36:35.201
No.

02:36:35.680 --> 02:36:37.887
He's too cunning for that.

02:36:39.640 --> 02:36:40.766
So where to now?

02:36:41.360 --> 02:36:42.691
The western guardroom.

02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:44.925
There may be a way out.

02:36:45.200 --> 02:36:47.202
It's too high. There's no chance...

02:36:47.440 --> 02:36:49.522
...that way.
- It's our only chance.

02:36:50.840 --> 02:36:52.330
We have to try.

02:37:08.880 --> 02:37:10.041
Come on.

02:37:57.560 --> 02:38:01.326
I've heard tell of
the wonders of Elvish medicine.

02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:04.291
That was a privilege to witness.

02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:07.921
Tauriel.

02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:13.446
Lie still.

02:38:20.640 --> 02:38:22.768
You cannot be her.

02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.402
She is far away.

02:38:32.600 --> 02:38:34.011
She is far...

02:38:34.240 --> 02:38:35.844
...far away from me.

02:38:37.480 --> 02:38:39.608
She walks...

02:38:39.840 --> 02:38:42.525
...in starlight in another world.

02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.808
It was just a dream.

02:39:01.480 --> 02:39:03.721
Do you think she could've loved me?

02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:11.800
Stay close.

02:39:22.440 --> 02:39:23.400
That's it, then.

02:39:24.480 --> 02:39:26.323
There's no way out.

02:39:32.720 --> 02:39:34.961
The last of our kin.

02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:40.722
They must have come here...

02:39:41.400 --> 02:39:42.447
...hoping...

02:39:42.680 --> 02:39:43.841
...beyond hope.

02:39:53.600 --> 02:39:55.921
We could try to reach the mines.

02:39:56.760 --> 02:39:59.001
We might last a few days.

02:40:01.160 --> 02:40:02.207
No.

02:40:05.160 --> 02:40:07.401
I will not die like this.

02:40:08.760 --> 02:40:09.921
Cowering.

02:40:10.800 --> 02:40:12.609
Clawing for breath.

02:40:17.520 --> 02:40:18.646
We make for the forges.

02:40:18.920 --> 02:40:20.888
He'll see us, sure as death.

02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:22.360
Not if we split up.

02:40:22.600 --> 02:40:23.240
Thorin...

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:25.330
...we'll never make it.

02:40:25.560 --> 02:40:27.085
Some of us might.

02:40:27.480 --> 02:40:29.721
Lead him to the forges.

02:40:30.480 --> 02:40:32.482
We kill the dragon.

02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:36.487
If this is to end in fire...

02:40:36.920 --> 02:40:39.321
...then we will all burn together.

02:40:40.640 --> 02:40:41.801
This way.

02:40:46.280 --> 02:40:46.849
Flee.

02:40:47.960 --> 02:40:48.882
Flee.

02:40:49.880 --> 02:40:51.848
Run for your lives.

02:40:52.600 --> 02:40:53.487
There is...

02:40:54.120 --> 02:40:56.327
...nowhere to hide.

02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:57.527
Behind you!

02:40:57.760 --> 02:40:58.647
Worm!

02:40:59.760 --> 02:41:00.443
Come on!

02:41:02.800 --> 02:41:03.847
Run!

02:41:05.800 --> 02:41:07.086
Hey, you!

02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:08.123
Here!

02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:08.128
This way. It's this way!

02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:09.526
Come on!

02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:10.363
Thorin!

02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:17.246
Follow Balin!

02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:19.680
- Thorin.
- Come on!

02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:36.885
Thorin!

02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:47.007
Hold on!

02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:22.171
Thorin!

02:45:25.040 --> 02:45:26.610
Go. Go!

02:45:30.320 --> 02:45:34.006
The plan's not gonna work.
These furnaces are stone cold.

02:45:34.240 --> 02:45:35.605
He's right. We've no...

02:45:35.840 --> 02:45:38.161
...fire hot enough to set them ablaze.

02:45:40.720 --> 02:45:42.085
Have we not?

02:45:43.640 --> 02:45:46.564
I did not look to see you so easily outwitted.

02:45:50.520 --> 02:45:51.200
You have grown...

02:45:51.400 --> 02:45:53.368
...slow and fat...

02:45:54.200 --> 02:45:55.087
...in your dotage...

02:45:57.520 --> 02:45:58.681
...slug!

02:46:00.080 --> 02:46:01.764
Take cover. Go!

02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:29.883
Bombur!

02:46:30.200 --> 02:46:31.611
Get those bellows working.

02:46:31.840 --> 02:46:32.966
Go!

02:46:46.760 --> 02:46:47.329
Bilbo!

02:46:47.600 --> 02:46:49.329
Up there. On my mark...

02:46:49.600 --> 02:46:50.886
...pull that lever.

02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:03.721
Balin! Can you still mix a flash-flame?

02:47:03.960 --> 02:47:06.361
Aye. It'll only take a jiffy. Come on!

02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:09.565
We don't have a jiffy.

02:47:21.520 --> 02:47:22.646
Where's the sulfur?

02:47:23.040 --> 02:47:23.882
You sure you know what...

02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:24.803
...you're doing?

02:47:36.560 --> 02:47:37.322
Come on!

02:47:59.640 --> 02:48:00.323
Now!

02:49:57.080 --> 02:49:59.162
Lead him to the Gallery of the Kings.

02:50:47.240 --> 02:50:48.241
Keep going, Bilbo!

02:50:48.800 --> 02:50:49.881
Run!

02:51:35.200 --> 02:51:36.201
You think you...

02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:38.408
...can deceive me, Barrel-rider?

02:51:41.960 --> 02:51:44.964
You have come from Lake-town.

02:51:46.680 --> 02:51:47.966
This is some...

02:51:48.200 --> 02:51:51.488
...sordid scheme hatched between
these filthy Dwarves...

02:51:51.720 --> 02:51:54.883
...and those miserable
tub-trading Lakemen.

02:51:55.880 --> 02:51:57.803
Those sniveling cowards...

02:51:58.040 --> 02:51:59.530
...with their long bows...

02:51:59.760 --> 02:52:02.604
...and Black Arrows.

02:52:02.960 --> 02:52:04.849
Perhaps it is time...

02:52:05.120 --> 02:52:07.009
...I paid them a visit.

02:52:07.520 --> 02:52:08.760
Oh, no.

02:52:10.640 --> 02:52:12.130
This isn't their fault!

02:52:12.360 --> 02:52:13.168
Wait!

02:52:13.400 --> 02:52:15.004
You cannot go to Lake-town!

02:52:16.920 --> 02:52:19.082
You care about them...

02:52:19.800 --> 02:52:21.040
you?

02:52:21.280 --> 02:52:22.247
Good.

02:52:22.960 --> 02:52:23.563
Then you can...

02:52:23.800 --> 02:52:25.370
...watch them die.

02:52:30.920 --> 02:52:32.046
Here!

02:52:32.960 --> 02:52:33.882
You witless worm.

02:52:40.800 --> 02:52:42.211
You.

02:52:42.600 --> 02:52:45.080
I am taking back what you stole.

02:52:49.120 --> 02:52:49.769
You...

02:52:50.040 --> 02:52:51.610
...will take nothing...

02:52:51.880 --> 02:52:53.530
...from me...

02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:54.961
...Dwarf.

02:52:55.440 --> 02:52:58.728
I laid low your warriors...

02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:00.564
...of old.

02:53:00.840 --> 02:53:03.207
I instilled terror in...

02:53:03.440 --> 02:53:05.124
...the hearts of Men.

02:53:06.280 --> 02:53:07.725
I am...

02:53:07.960 --> 02:53:09.325
...King Under...

02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:11.649
...the Mountain.

02:53:12.080 --> 02:53:14.367
This is not your kingdom.

02:53:14.600 --> 02:53:16.602
These are Dwarf lands.

02:53:17.360 --> 02:53:18.247
This is Dwarf gold.

02:53:20.680 --> 02:53:21.408
And we will...

02:53:21.640 --> 02:53:23.802
...have our revenge.

02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:46.168
Revenge?!

02:54:48.000 --> 02:54:49.650
Revenge?!

02:54:50.440 --> 02:54:54.365
I will show you revenge!

02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:32.887
Listen to me!

02:55:33.440 --> 02:55:35.727
Do you not know what is coming?

02:55:38.160 --> 02:55:41.881
I am fire.

02:55:43.080 --> 02:55:45.560
I am...

02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:49.131
...death.

02:55:57.840 --> 02:56:00.047
What have we done?
