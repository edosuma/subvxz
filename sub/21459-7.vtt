I moved to Siesta Key

00:08.258 --> 00:09.134
{\an8}hoping for the summer
of a lifetime.

00:09.217 --> 00:11.761
{\an8}And I finally felt
like I was fitting in

00:11.845 --> 00:13.930
{\an5}with a new group of friends...

00:11.845 --> 00:13.930
{\an3}Yeah!

00:14.013 --> 00:15.056
Whoo!

00:15.140 --> 00:16.683
...but Garrett and I
took a break...

00:16.766 --> 00:18.476
I'm not gonna tell you,
like, what to do.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.812
...just when Alex invited us all
on a trip to Bimini.

00:20.895 --> 00:23.773
And Garrett decided
not to go.

00:23.857 --> 00:24.607
If something did happen,

00:24.691 --> 00:25.942
{\an1}I'm not gonna be
the boyfriend anymore.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.486
(Kelsey)
As soon as we got to Bimini,

00:28.570 --> 00:30.822
the trip got off
on the wrong foot.

00:30.905 --> 00:32.115
{\an1}I think we should do
something special.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.992
{\an1}Like a big dinner
or something.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.410
A big dinner?

00:36.870 --> 00:40.039
{\an5}(Kelsey)
For some reason, Alex and Paul
were being really mean to Chloe.

00:40.123 --> 00:43.001
Why can't you guys just
be like, ha-ha?

00:43.084 --> 00:44.169
Like, it's funny.

00:44.252 --> 00:45.462
(Kelsey)
Teasing her about her weight...

00:45.545 --> 00:47.046
I'm here for you
not matter what.

00:47.130 --> 00:47.964
...and leaving the rest of us
to pick up the pieces.

00:48.047 --> 00:51.301
Just shows me that maybe
him and I aren't

00:51.384 --> 00:53.303
as good as friends anymore
as we used to be.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.554
What a shame.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.805
(Kelsey)
In the Bahamas,

00:55.889 --> 00:57.307
I was doing my best
to be good...

00:57.390 --> 00:59.476
{\an1}If you want to go to dinner,
I'm totally open.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.895
...but it seemed like Juliette
was super jealous

01:01.978 --> 01:03.354
that Alex was
spending time with me...

01:03.438 --> 01:05.857
{\an1}(Juliette)
Look at Kelsey all over Alex.

01:05.940 --> 01:09.194
...and she was willing to do
anything to make me look bad.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.488
I'll tell her boyfriend.

01:11.571 --> 01:13.323
{\an5}(Kelsey)
At least I had Madisson
by my side.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.824
We were new friends,

01:14.908 --> 01:17.327
and I loved that she and Brandon
were getting serious.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
{\an8}Absolutely.

01:18.578 --> 01:20.246
{\an9}With me?

01:20.330 --> 01:21.331
(both laughing)

01:21.414 --> 01:22.791
(Kelsey)
Despite all the drama,

01:22.874 --> 01:25.126
it was definitely fun
being away for a week.

01:25.210 --> 01:26.669
{\an1}(Madisson)
Are you nervous to go back?

01:26.753 --> 01:29.047
I am, 'cause, like,
I feel like I might have

01:29.130 --> 01:30.298
blown it with Garrett now.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.549
(Kelsey)
But once we got home,

02:54.799 --> 02:56.259
we were all at the pool.

03:19.282 --> 03:20.909
{\an5}No, and I know...

03:19.282 --> 03:20.909
...kinda falling
into his trap.

03:20.992 --> 03:22.535
{\an1}I think I'll talk to her
about that, obviously, too.

{\an1}Like, the whole reason,
like, with her and me

03:25.038 --> 03:27.624
{\an1}like, having those problems
was, like, flirting with Alex.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.000
{\an1}I'm sure you know
all about that.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.835
{\an1}And, like, obviously
we were dating at the time.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.462

05:08.391 --> 05:10.601
{\an8}Did you all sleep

05:10.685 --> 05:12.854
{\an8}I slept with Chloe

05:12.937 --> 05:14.647

got that, though.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.237

05:21.320 --> 05:23.281
{\an1}Vacation was kinda odd,
you know, just being trapped

05:23.364 --> 05:26.617
{\an1}in that, you know,
Kelsey-Juliette web.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.536
I wouldn't describe it
as much as a web.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.829
{\an1}Yeah, more like
a seesaw.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.831
{\an5}You were, like, bouncing...

05:29.912 --> 05:31.831
No, I wasn't.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.332
{\an1}(laughing)

05:33.416 --> 05:35.585

out on a dinner date.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.587
{\an1}Wait, is she not
dating Garrett at all?

05:37.670 --> 05:39.630
{\an5}I think they broke up.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.630
Like, for good?

05:39.714 --> 05:41.340
{\an6}I guess.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.340
What's he doing?

05:41.424 --> 05:43.176
{\an5}I haven't really talked
to her about that.

05:41.424 --> 05:43.176
{\an1}Swap.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.261
I hope she didn't break up
with him for Alex.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.596
{\an7}Yeah.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.596
{\an9}Yeah.

05:45.344 --> 05:46.596
{\an7}Yeah.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.097
{\an8}(Alex)
We were all under one roof

05:48.181 --> 05:49.432
and obviously, like, when
you're around someone

05:49.515 --> 05:53.603
{\an1}that you used to have, like,
a relationship with,

05:53.686 --> 05:55.605
it's, like, easy to fall
back in that hole.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.565
I mean, I don't even
want Kelsey

05:57.648 --> 05:58.024
to find out what happened.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.400
{\an4}Yeah.

05:58.107 --> 05:59.400
{\an3}But...

05:59.484 --> 06:03.029
{\an1}No offense, he's kinda just
maybe not using you,

06:03.112 --> 06:05.948
{\an1}but you're just available
whenever he wants you.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.659
{\an1}And that's not
what you deserve.

06:10.495 --> 06:13.289
I mean, we're, like,
using each other.

06:13.372 --> 06:14.665
(laughter)

06:14.749 --> 06:17.752
{\an1}Yeah, you are, but, like,
don't you want more than that?

06:20.046 --> 06:21.839
{\an1}So, like, why do you keep
going back to him?

06:21.923 --> 06:24.634
'Cause I, like, I like
spending time with him.

06:24.717 --> 06:25.968
{\an3}He's funny.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.471
Because everyone wants
what they can't have?

06:28.554 --> 06:30.139
You're so smart.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.725
{\an7}Alex has just been, like,
an ongoing thing for so long.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.477
{\an8}Like, do you want to date him?

06:35.728 --> 06:37.897
I would, but then
I just would, like,

06:37.980 --> 06:40.149
{\an5}never trust him.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.149
Yeah, exactly.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.485
{\an5}That's why you leave him.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.485
Yeah, no, I know.

06:42.568 --> 06:43.611
I know, okay!

06:44.946 --> 06:46.697
{\an1}I think it's, like,
pretty, you know, obvious

06:46.781 --> 06:48.950
{\an1}that you're leaning towards one
over the other.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.910
It's hard to say.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.620
You can't control the weather.

06:52.703 --> 06:53.996
{\an3}No, I know.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.832
{\an1}All right, let's hit the pool
or do something.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.916
{\an5}Let's do it.

06:55.915 --> 06:56.916
I'm hungry as well.

06:56.999 --> 06:58.626
{\an1}I need to, like,
figure it out.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.962
{\an5}Make a decision.

06:58.709 --> 07:00.962
I'll have to make a decision.

07:01.045 --> 07:02.296
If I'm gonna cut it off,

I was, like, the beach girl.

{\an1}that are pushing
and poking my buttons.

31:01.818 --> 31:02.860
{\an1}It just...
maybe I need to, like,

31:02.944 --> 31:04.779

from you guys.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.824

{\an4}Yeah.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.889
But, like...

34:59.972 --> 35:01.516
he seems like he has
a sense of humor,

35:01.599 --> 35:02.391
he's very confident and...

35:02.475 --> 35:04.435
but he's not, like,
cocky at all.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.355
{\an4}Yeah.

35:04.519 --> 35:07.355
And, like, comfortable

35:07.438 --> 35:09.982
{\an5}Yeah.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.982

35:11.943 --> 35:13.152

did you date her for?

About a year.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.240

35:17.323 --> 35:19.158
that we were going
different ways,

35:19.242 --> 35:21.118
so it'd be easier just to let
things go off for a little bit.

35:21.202 --> 35:23.037

you're, uh...

{\an1}Well, really, obviously
they're more... they're deeper

35:41.514 --> 35:42.265
{\an5}for Grant because...

35:41.514 --> 35:42.265
