WEBVTT

00:04.658 --> 00:08.873
They need me at the branch office
to help handle the holiday deluge.

00:10.417 --> 00:14.214
Terrific, and now this.
My coat's underneath this mess.

00:14.382 --> 00:19.139
Come on up here and get your jackets.
This is officiaI government business.

00:20.974 --> 00:23.353
Got it, Sam.

00:23.521 --> 00:25.899
Stand back. I'm going in.

00:30.573 --> 00:34.078
I'll find you...

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:45.888 --> 00:50.644
- This is obviously not my...
- Put it on or I tear off your clothes.

00:50.811 --> 00:53.398
Yes, ma'am. Yes, God bless you, Carla.

00:56.570 --> 00:59.450
At least dogs won't attack their own.

02:15.399 --> 02:17.443
Allow me.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.905
Thank you.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.786
Watch this.

02:24.872 --> 02:29.043
- How do you not burn your hand?
- I don't.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.345
Show her some of the other tricks.

02:35.512 --> 02:39.644
- You know a lot of tricks, do you?
- Yeah, I know my share.

02:39.811 --> 02:44.025
Show her the one about
the disappearing girlfriend.

02:44.193 --> 02:47.113
You'II like this one. Watch this.

02:57.421 --> 03:00.217
Welcome to Cheers.
What can I get you?

03:00.384 --> 03:04.807
- What's your bartender's specialty?
- He's got hot buttered rum going.

03:04.974 --> 03:10.023
Sounds good. Make it a double.
I've just had the worst day of my life.

03:10.190 --> 03:14.656
You know what I always say?
Life is like a Chinese banquet.

03:14.823 --> 03:17.868
Between the Peking duck
and the sweet and sour fish,

03:18.035 --> 03:20.373
you have to expect chicken feet soup.

03:20.540 --> 03:22.417
So laugh.

03:23.461 --> 03:27.591
I've just been told
I have six months to live.

03:32.849 --> 03:35.395
I'm sorry.

03:35.603 --> 03:38.650
I didn't mean to be facetious.
I'm terribly sorry.

03:38.817 --> 03:43.116
- I went on and on like a ninny.
- Hey, can I get you something?

03:45.869 --> 03:49.208
Sammy, how do you do this trick?
That one.

03:49.375 --> 03:53.339
It's all in your mind. Think about
the most pleasant thing in your life.

03:54.466 --> 03:59.015
Being burned by this would be
the most pleasant thing in my life.

04:04.773 --> 04:08.069
- You have to talk to that man there.
- Why?

04:08.237 --> 04:13.536
He came in here because he just
found out he's got six months to live.

04:13.703 --> 04:16.541
That's not just an opening line?

04:18.209 --> 04:23.260
What kind of a reptile
would say that as a sexuaI overture?

04:24.637 --> 04:28.017
Nobody. I mean, not me, that's for sure.

04:31.229 --> 04:35.362
- He seems to want to talk about it.
- I'll talk to him.

04:35.528 --> 04:39.659
How do you cheer someone up
who's got six months to live?

04:39.826 --> 04:42.622
I'll tell him I have five.

04:42.789 --> 04:45.627
- What's he drinking?
- Hot buttered rum.

04:45.794 --> 04:48.757
Hey, everybody, now watch this.

04:51.302 --> 04:56.227
Hey, way to go, Coach. You did it.
You must have a high threshold of pain.

04:56.394 --> 04:59.731
- I don't know the meaning of the word.
- Pretty tough guy.

04:59.898 --> 05:02.945
No, he doesn't know
what "threshold" means.

05:06.617 --> 05:08.537
Thanks, Normie.

05:08.703 --> 05:12.877
Hi, can I join you? My name's Sam
Malone. I'm the owner of the bar.

05:13.044 --> 05:15.089
- Malcolm Kramer.
- How do you do?

05:15.256 --> 05:19.053
Before I retired I owned a chemicaI plant
outside of Chicago.

05:20.304 --> 05:25.229
This may be none of my business
but have you got a second opinion?

05:25.396 --> 05:29.402
- Doctors make mistakes.
- Every doctor says the same thing

05:29.569 --> 05:33.116
and I've been to twelve
leading specialists.

05:33.283 --> 05:37.873
Maybe you'd get better news
if you went to a quack.

05:38.583 --> 05:42.505
- How's your drink?
- Excellent. You're a good bartender.

05:45.468 --> 05:48.347
They sound as if
they're having a good time.

05:48.515 --> 05:53.021
I worked my way through Harvard
tending bar. The best years of my life.

05:53.188 --> 05:56.234
Do you think you've still got the touch?

05:57.278 --> 05:59.990
- You mean it?
- Why not? Come on.

06:00.158 --> 06:03.662
We've only got two rules -
no empty glasses on the bar

06:03.829 --> 06:07.960
and if somebody belches,
blame a waitress.

06:28.993 --> 06:32.581
He did it! What am I yelling about?
I bet against him.

06:32.748 --> 06:36.420
- Thank you very much.
- You never lose it.

06:39.801 --> 06:42.137
This guy's terrific.

06:42.304 --> 06:45.726
He's a great storyteller
and he knows what he's doing.

06:45.893 --> 06:49.608
We should have an older guy behind
the bar. The customers like it.

06:49.775 --> 06:53.238
- What about you, Coach?
- I'd like it, too.

06:53.405 --> 06:56.033
- I'll think about it.
- Thanks, Sam.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.497
We're low on beer mugs.
Can someone wash these?

06:59.664 --> 07:02.293
- I'd love to.
- You like washing glasses?

07:02.460 --> 07:05.506
You bet. I feeI like
an 18-year-old college boy.

07:05.673 --> 07:08.845
Me, too. See one around?

07:09.011 --> 07:11.641
You're on, cutie.

07:14.145 --> 07:17.525
- About time you got back.
- What's the big deaI?

07:17.692 --> 07:20.697
The wind shot right through that old thing.

07:21.906 --> 07:25.537
And those Lifesavers had to be
at least a year old.

07:26.998 --> 07:32.298
If Boston ever knew how close it came
to a catastrophe, there'd be panic.

07:32.465 --> 07:35.678
Kramer, that's Cliff. Give him a beer.

07:35.845 --> 07:39.057
That's Mr Kramer. He's a customer.

07:39.225 --> 07:43.522
I'd rather have my potables prepared
by a competent mixologist.

07:43.689 --> 07:47.738
Be a little sensitive.
Sam's letting him do this as a favour.

07:47.905 --> 07:51.701
Doc says he's going belly-up
in a few months.

07:53.455 --> 07:57.126
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Those are the breaks, huh?

07:58.629 --> 08:01.842
Mr Kramer, you wanted me to tell you
when it was 11:00.

08:02.009 --> 08:05.597
- I've got a plane to catch.
- You're really gonna leave?

08:05.765 --> 08:12.191
Yes. I don't want them to call me "the
late Malcolm Kramer" before it's officiaI.

08:14.070 --> 08:17.658
- Thank you, Sam.
- Anytime, Malcolm.

08:17.824 --> 08:21.372
- Listen, you come back before...
- Soon.

08:21.539 --> 08:24.000
Come back reaI soon.

08:25.086 --> 08:27.590
Goodnight, everybody. And thank you.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.012
I've had a wonderfuI time
just when I needed it.

08:31.179 --> 08:36.602
Someday I hope you'll appreciate
how much I really did enjoy it.

08:39.607 --> 08:42.571
- Goodbye, Mr Kramer.
- Now that's a nice guy.

08:42.738 --> 08:46.952
Thanks, Norm. My pop always told me
to say goodbye.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.005
Excuse me.

08:54.172 --> 08:57.969
What you people did this evening
was magnificent.

08:58.136 --> 09:04.396
It strengthened in me a faith in humanity
that gets a little shaky at times.

09:04.563 --> 09:08.694
I want you all to know that there's
nothing that I wouldn't do for any of you.

09:08.861 --> 09:12.950
- Hot dog!
- Drop the skivvies and dance!

09:15.245 --> 09:17.291
Maggots!

09:20.546 --> 09:26.472
Who's the wise guy who shoved
the I.O.U. in the tip glass?

09:26.638 --> 09:30.101
Let me see this. It's not an I.O.U.

09:30.268 --> 09:34.609
This is... a bunch of writing
I don't understand.

09:34.776 --> 09:37.613
- Is it in a foreign tongue?
- No, it's English.

09:37.780 --> 09:41.077
In your case, that qualifies.

09:46.376 --> 09:48.713
"To Whom It May Concern.

09:48.880 --> 09:54.514
"Please be advised that herewith
I amend my will to provide the following...

09:54.680 --> 09:59.437
"As a token for their kindness,
I leave the sum of...

09:59.604 --> 10:03.903
"$100,000 to the gang at Cheers,
signed Malcolm Kramer. "

10:05.279 --> 10:07.367
Is this a joke?

10:07.533 --> 10:10.913
Cliff, check that out. See if it's valid.

10:16.338 --> 10:19.385
I don't want to pronounce judgment
too hastily,

10:19.552 --> 10:24.601
but I think there is a precedent
in the case of Penoyer versus Neff,

10:24.768 --> 10:29.567
when it was found that jurisprudence
is the better part of diction.

10:31.736 --> 10:35.952
- Tom, you're a lawyer, aren't you?
- I work for Singer and Fleckman.

10:36.119 --> 10:39.291
Take a look at this.
Tell me what it means.

10:41.252 --> 10:44.590
His intent here
was to have everybody at Cheers

10:44.757 --> 10:46.801
split up $100,000 when he dies.

10:46.969 --> 10:51.017
I heard him say he was rich,
but I thought it was a line.

10:51.182 --> 10:55.022
- Sam, who would use a line like that?
- Not me.

10:55.982 --> 10:58.987
100 grand.
What does that come out to each?

10:59.154 --> 11:02.534
Looks like approximately $2,500.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.622
Minus my accounting fee,
that's a 100 bucks.

11:05.788 --> 11:09.628
- We each get a 100 bucks?
- No, you split a 100 bucks.

11:09.794 --> 11:14.384
Wait a minute. It doesn't say anything
about dividing it equally.

11:14.551 --> 11:18.850
A lot of these people
didn't give the guy the time of day.

11:20.603 --> 11:23.983
Wait a minute!
It doesn't matter anyway.

11:24.150 --> 11:26.445
This paper is worthless.

11:26.612 --> 11:30.451
In order for a will to be valid
according to Massachusetts law,

11:30.618 --> 11:33.206
the stipulations must be precise

11:33.373 --> 11:37.544
and the document signed by
three witnesses, which this isn't.

11:37.712 --> 11:43.763
Come on. It's a beautifuI souvenir of
an evening of generosity and goodwill.

11:43.930 --> 11:46.893
To hell with that! I want my money!
Money!

11:50.357 --> 11:54.780
Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea here.

11:54.947 --> 11:58.702
If we can bring him back,
we could get him to write a valid will

11:58.869 --> 12:02.458
and then he can stipulate
who he wants to get how much.

12:02.625 --> 12:05.505
Sure. He's on his way to the airport.

12:05.672 --> 12:08.551
- Catch him at the hoteI.
- I'll go get him.

12:08.717 --> 12:10.804
- Why you?
- He liked me best.

12:10.971 --> 12:14.727
- Yeah? What makes you think so?
- He embraced me.

12:14.894 --> 12:16.939
We never saw that.

12:17.106 --> 12:19.484
It wasn't an overt embrace.

12:19.651 --> 12:23.115
It was more like we hugged
with our eyes.

12:25.702 --> 12:30.625
Whoever goes is gonna have
an opportunity at sweet-talking the guy,

12:30.793 --> 12:34.591
so we better
send somebody that we all trust.

12:34.757 --> 12:36.802
Absolutely. OK, I'll go.

12:36.969 --> 12:40.433
You'd shoot your mother
in the back for two bits.

12:40.600 --> 12:46.150
- My mother's a saint!
- Send Coach. You all trust Coach.

12:46.317 --> 12:48.820
OK, here I go.

12:48.987 --> 12:51.742
I'm with it.

12:55.289 --> 12:59.377
Play it cooI. We don't want to
appear too eager and scare the guy off.

12:59.545 --> 13:03.468
Tell him his adopted son Norm
sends his love.

13:04.220 --> 13:06.973
I want all you guys to know

13:07.140 --> 13:10.728
that it's a privilege
that you picked me for this job

13:10.895 --> 13:14.985
and I hope I can answer
your expectations.

13:20.117 --> 13:23.039
What were your expectations?

13:32.275 --> 13:35.906
Coach has been gone an hour.
I wonder what he's up to.

13:36.072 --> 13:41.998
OK, Sammy, this is it! This will satisfy
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts

13:42.166 --> 13:47.006
and all we need is Kramer's signature
and three witnesses and we got it.

13:47.173 --> 13:50.845
Don't think you're gonna get a bigger cut.

13:51.429 --> 13:55.810
Listen. On behalf of the federaI
government, I'd better take a look at this.

13:58.273 --> 14:01.319
You misspelled Massachusetts,
first of all.

14:01.486 --> 14:05.825
On the face of it, this is all prima facie
non corpus interruptus anyhow.

14:07.036 --> 14:09.999
You're wasting our time. This guy!

14:10.166 --> 14:13.380
- What kind of lawyer are you?
- You wouldn't know.

14:13.546 --> 14:15.591
Try me, Raymond Burr-brain.

14:16.718 --> 14:22.017
I'm not actually an attorney yet. I'm
gonna take my bar exam next month.

14:22.184 --> 14:27.234
- The guy's here on false pretences.
- Let's boot him out in the snow!

14:30.739 --> 14:33.243
Hey, come on! Whoa! Take it easy!

14:33.410 --> 14:35.538
This is getting crazy. Settle down.

14:35.705 --> 14:39.127
- They're back!
- Hooray for Mr Kramer!

14:50.059 --> 14:52.564
What took you so long, Coach?

14:52.731 --> 14:55.068
I had to dig the car out...

14:55.234 --> 14:58.740
- Why didn't you just take a cab?
- It wasn't worth it.

14:58.906 --> 15:01.745
The hoteI's only a block away.

15:01.911 --> 15:05.292
I want you to say hello
to my best friend, Mr Kramer.

15:05.459 --> 15:07.670
There's some problem about my will?

15:07.837 --> 15:11.759
Mr Kramer, you made a wonderfuI
gesture to these people

15:11.926 --> 15:13.971
and now they're asking you to repeat it.

15:14.138 --> 15:16.976
You do that to me every night.

15:19.062 --> 15:22.358
I'm waiting for you to get it right.

15:24.738 --> 15:27.617
Mr Kramer, it was a wonderfuI gesture

15:27.783 --> 15:31.624
but you didn't tell us
how you wanted us to split it up.

15:31.790 --> 15:35.505
You see, what we got here
is a reaI problem.

15:35.671 --> 15:42.097
Who gets what? These bozos
or my five precious children.

15:43.642 --> 15:48.232
Posing for this picture is the longest
they've ever stood without crutches.

15:50.236 --> 15:54.574
Peddle those monsters somewhere else.
It's tonight that counts.

15:54.742 --> 15:57.996
Remember those times we had
standing over there?

15:58.164 --> 16:03.797
How can you ever forget that delightfuI
walk you and I took over to the jukebox?

16:03.965 --> 16:07.219
You turned to me
when you wanted to know the time.

16:07.387 --> 16:11.225
- You didn't tell me.
- What am I, Big Ben?

16:12.811 --> 16:17.651
Why don't you just give
all your money to your relatives?

16:19.196 --> 16:21.408
I don't have any close relatives.

16:21.574 --> 16:24.788
- You do now, Mervyn.
- My name is Malcolm.

16:24.955 --> 16:30.296
May I call you Mervyn?
That was my father's name.

16:31.965 --> 16:35.470
Mr Kramer, you could
give this money to charity.

16:35.637 --> 16:38.308
Hey, I am charity. Beat it!

16:41.229 --> 16:45.944
I don't have time to deaI with this.
Life's too short. I have a plane to catch.

16:46.111 --> 16:50.994
I'm gonna sign the money all over to you.
You can divide it as you see fit.

16:51.162 --> 16:53.205
- No...
- Sorry. I've got to run.

16:53.372 --> 16:57.295
Goodbye, everybody. Goodnight.
And thanks again.

16:57.462 --> 17:01.969
- Goodnight, Mr Kramer.
- Yeah, don't be a stranger.

17:04.431 --> 17:07.185
Come on, would you? Stop it.

17:07.352 --> 17:10.900
Now I'm gonna try to divide this up
fair and square,

17:11.067 --> 17:13.819
but no appeals
to friendship and sentiment

17:13.987 --> 17:16.031
and none of that kissy-kissy stuff.

17:16.199 --> 17:20.872
How much evidence do you need?
Does there have to be blood shed?

17:21.039 --> 17:23.417
- Destroy the will.
- Let's kill her!

17:29.761 --> 17:32.933
- What's it gonna be?
- Yeah, walk like a man.

17:34.602 --> 17:39.400
Everybody in this room right now
gets an equaI share and that's it.

17:46.161 --> 17:48.248
What are you doing?

17:53.046 --> 17:55.216
Now it's over. It's done.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.679
Everybody get back to normaI.

18:05.274 --> 18:09.113
We should have killed her
when we had the chance.

18:09.280 --> 18:14.121
- I hope it taught you a lesson.
- About not being greedy about money?

18:14.288 --> 18:18.085
No, always dispose
of flaming materials properly.

18:20.130 --> 18:23.927
We should have known. Guys like us
don't get that kind of money.

18:24.094 --> 18:29.311
Well, we're no poorer now than we were
when we came in here tonight.

18:29.477 --> 18:32.106
You can talk. You're gonna be a lawyer.

18:32.273 --> 18:36.195
- But a bad one.
- Wanna give me a break?

18:36.362 --> 18:40.201
Cheers is Cheers again
and I'm relieved.

18:40.368 --> 18:44.916
I'm going to go thank Sam
and all of you should, too.

18:46.169 --> 18:49.633
And, by the way,
with all the insanity about the will,

18:49.799 --> 18:51.969
no-one said a word about my hairdo.

18:52.137 --> 18:57.227
- It stinks.
- There. Now was that so hard?

19:02.068 --> 19:07.369
What you did out there was fine
and noble and I'm very proud of you.

19:09.455 --> 19:13.044
And I can tell by that look
you're proud of yourself.

19:13.211 --> 19:17.509
Yes, Diane, I am. I'm proud and...

19:17.676 --> 19:20.179
rich.

19:25.771 --> 19:29.944
- What's that?
- This baby is my ticket to happiness.

19:30.111 --> 19:32.865
This is the will. I burned the phoney one.

19:33.032 --> 19:35.077
What? How?

19:35.244 --> 19:38.624
Are you kidding me?
I do magic, remember?

19:38.791 --> 19:41.294
Watch this.

19:48.764 --> 19:50.893
Oh, lookee here!

19:51.893 --> 19:53.939
That is the most avaricious,

19:54.106 --> 19:58.320
unregenerate, rapacious thing
you have ever done!

19:58.487 --> 20:03.202
Wait. A couple of those words
didn't sound very nice.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.790
How's this? You have sunk so low

20:05.957 --> 20:09.588
you would need a ladder
to kiss a snake's hinie.

20:10.965 --> 20:14.970
That's clear, but why?
I thought it was pretty good.

20:15.138 --> 20:18.643
I saw those people
going at each other's throats.

20:18.810 --> 20:21.522
This was the best possible solution.

20:21.689 --> 20:24.777
Come on, look at it logically.

20:24.944 --> 20:28.491
How are you going to explain
your new-found riches to them?

20:28.658 --> 20:32.789
Give me a little credit here. I won't
change my lifestyle all of a sudden.

20:32.956 --> 20:36.212
My purchases will be simple.

20:36.378 --> 20:41.427
Television, maybe. A pair of shoes.
A couple pairs of pants.

20:41.594 --> 20:45.267
Trip to the Canaries
in my brand new 60-foot yacht.

20:49.398 --> 20:54.113
I know what you're worried about.
Hey, come on. You're my sweetie.

20:54.281 --> 20:59.372
I'll split the money with you. Think about
all the good you can do with it.

20:59.538 --> 21:02.251
What good could come of this?

21:03.461 --> 21:05.924
Charities.

21:06.758 --> 21:10.179
I suppose one could do wonders

21:10.346 --> 21:13.810
with a lot of money,
if one were so inclined.

21:13.978 --> 21:16.940
I could donate
to environmentaI charities.

21:17.107 --> 21:20.822
Fight world hunger,
save endangered species,

21:20.989 --> 21:24.327
and grab up that fabulous silk dress
at Claudine's.

21:24.493 --> 21:28.749
- Yes!
- Oh, no! Now I'm doing it!

21:28.917 --> 21:33.048
- I won't let you do this to your friends!
- What are you gonna do? Rat on me?

21:36.177 --> 21:39.766
Wait a second!
This is what we're talking about here.

21:39.933 --> 21:44.149
- You're crazy.
- I may be crazy but I'm not stupid.

21:44.315 --> 21:47.236
- You're very stupid.
- I'll tell you how stupid I am.

21:47.404 --> 21:50.116
I see through you like a book.

21:50.283 --> 21:52.661
Ah, that stupid.

21:52.828 --> 21:55.123
You want my money.

21:55.290 --> 21:59.172
What are you gonna do?
You gonna blackmaiI me for it?

22:00.298 --> 22:03.678
You just lost your boat ride, baby.

22:05.346 --> 22:08.226
You can't slap me. I'm a rich guy.

22:09.979 --> 22:12.441
How long are you
gonna keep doing this?

22:12.608 --> 22:16.364
I don't know you. I've never seen you
like this and I don't like it.

22:16.531 --> 22:21.789
Don't let this come between us.
I want you to help me spend the money.

22:21.956 --> 22:25.002
- It will make us happy.
- It's making me miserable.

22:25.169 --> 22:28.132
Wait till you see the fun we have
on that boat!

22:28.298 --> 22:32.806
If that guy would kick off in four months,
we could have that baby by spring!

22:32.972 --> 22:38.105
- Did you hear what you just said?
- Oh, my... God.

22:38.272 --> 22:41.486
That was a horrible thing to say,
wasn't it?

22:41.653 --> 22:46.368
Six months would be fine.
We could catch the Gulf Stream.

22:46.535 --> 22:50.792
What's happening to me?
I'm turning into a horrible person.

22:50.959 --> 22:53.170
Yes, you are.

22:56.216 --> 23:00.014
I'm gonna do what I should have done
when I set eyes on this.

23:00.181 --> 23:03.602
I'm gonna destroy it
before it destroys me.

23:10.070 --> 23:12.282
That was the right thing to do.

23:12.448 --> 23:15.579
Now let's forget
that any of this ever happened.

23:15.745 --> 23:18.040
Yes, let's.

23:29.308 --> 23:32.730
I hate myself for what I just thought.

23:34.942 --> 23:37.738
No, I won't even say it.

23:40.284 --> 23:43.830
I know you didn't...
but let me know better.

23:43.997 --> 23:47.794
Come on. Do you think
I would do something like that again

23:47.961 --> 23:50.799
after what I just went through?

23:50.966 --> 23:54.722
I'm sorry. Of course not.

23:54.889 --> 23:57.267
Any person who would do that

23:57.434 --> 24:02.484
would have guilt eating away
at his guts for the rest of his life.

24:03.193 --> 24:05.196
Thank you.

24:17.215 --> 24:19.968
I hate her.

24:20.135 --> 24:23.516
I really, really do.
I hate her so much.

24:55.898 --> 24:56.899
