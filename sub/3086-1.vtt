00:14.000 --> 00:20.189
When it's coming apart, you had it all

00:21.360 --> 00:24.875
It wasn't enough

00:25.720 --> 00:29.429
No, it's not enough

00:31.000 --> 00:34.197
They tell you it's not worth the price

00:34.400 --> 00:37.676
So just let it go

00:38.600 --> 00:42.354
But you know you can't

00:43.040 --> 00:46.953
You know you won't

00:48.680 --> 00:56.268
It's not easy, no, finding the words to say

00:57.080 --> 01:03.918
When you're feeling lost, you'll find your way

01:05.720 --> 01:11.590
The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold

01:14.240 --> 01:20.349
At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home

01:23.000 --> 01:28.836
The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know

01:31.200 --> 01:33.555
But the angels, they brought you

01:33.760 --> 01:37.958
And they're gonna hold you up

01:38.200 --> 01:41.397
They're gonna hold you up

01:44.680 --> 01:47.433
They see the fear in your eyes

01:47.640 --> 01:50.677
Heart sinks like a stone

01:52.160 --> 01:59.669
'Cause when you're afraid, it weighs on your soul

02:02.040 --> 02:07.990
When the timing is right, somehow you'll know

02:09.520 --> 02:17.154
When nobody stands, stand on your own

02:19.320 --> 02:27.079
It's not easy, no, finding the words to say

02:28.000 --> 02:34.189
When you're feeling lost, you'll find your way

02:36.480 --> 02:42.237
The world is so broken and sometimes it leaves you cold

02:45.160 --> 02:51.190
At nighttimes you can't feel the fire to guide you home

02:53.840 --> 02:59.039
The demons will harm you and try to steal what you know

03:01.960 --> 03:04.315
But the angels, they brought you

03:04.520 --> 03:08.752
And they're gonna hold you up

03:09.000 --> 03:11.594
They're gonna hold you up

03:17.640 --> 03:20.518
They're gonna hold you up

03:26.280 --> 03:29.158
They're gonna hold you up

03:34.800 --> 03:37.792
They're gonna hold you up

03:39.440 --> 03:41.908
- Name?
- Wheaton. Josh Wheaton.

03:42.120 --> 03:43.553
You got your
pre-registration sheet?

03:43.760 --> 03:45.398
Yeah.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.639
All core requirements are here.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.229
What is your humanities elective?

03:51.440 --> 03:52.839
Philosophy 150.

03:53.080 --> 03:56.277
Radisson, 11:00 on Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.

03:57.680 --> 03:59.875
You might want to think about a different instructor.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.479
Because?

04:01.680 --> 04:03.380
Let's just say you're wandering into the snake pit.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.399
I'd recommend Patel or maybe Mueller.

04:07.640 --> 04:10.313
Come on, man.
It can't be that bad.

04:10.560 --> 04:15.839
Think Roman Colosseum, lions,
people cheering for your death.

04:16.040 --> 04:17.940
Yeah, but I'd have to rearrange my whole schedule.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.473
I don't think
I can really--

04:19.680 --> 04:21.317
It's your funeral.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.474
Last drop date is the 22nd.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.592
You might want to keep that in mind.

04:28.800 --> 04:30.279
You're done.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.471
- Thanks.
- Yeah, have a good semester.

04:34.120 --> 04:36.111
- Hi.
- Martin Yip.

04:38.680 --> 04:40.716
What does
P.R.C. stand for?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.632
People's Republic of China.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.711
Oh. Seriously?

04:44.920 --> 04:47.309
Oh yes, always serious.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.272
Okay.

05:04.240 --> 05:07.198
You've gotta be kidding me!

05:16.760 --> 05:18.910
White & Wolfe, how can I help you?

05:19.120 --> 05:20.519
Yes, please hold.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.153
White & Wolfe.

05:22.360 --> 05:23.918
Mm-hmm, I will let 'em know
you called.

05:24.120 --> 05:25.519
Thank you, bye-bye.

05:25.668 --> 05:27.335
Buy as much Tochigi Heavy Industries

05:27.360 --> 05:28.918
as you can on-margin.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.519
We've gotten wind of a merger

05:30.760 --> 05:34.548
and the Japanese could care less about insider trading.

05:34.760 --> 05:39.470
You're gonna thank me for this one, I guarantee it.

05:41.520 --> 05:42.919
You're on with Marc.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.553
Hey, I need you to give me directions.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.159
You're kidding, right?

05:46.400 --> 05:47.799
No, somebody stole my GPS

05:48.000 --> 05:50.070
and my phone has decided that
it is spinning propeller time.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.721
Can't do it.
The Nikkei just opened

05:51.920 --> 05:53.592
and there's a massive
sell-off going on.

05:53.800 --> 05:56.155
Oh, and by the way, I made reservations for us Friday

05:56.360 --> 05:57.759
at La Rive Gauche.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.433
Wait, you'll take me to La Rive Gauche

05:59.640 --> 06:03.155
but you won't take the time to give me directions?

06:03.360 --> 06:05.954
What's in it for me?

06:06.160 --> 06:08.230
You're kidding, right?

06:08.440 --> 06:09.873
You're serious.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.310
Okay, well, I'm on my way to an ambush interview

06:12.520 --> 06:14.954
of Duck Commander Willie Robertson,

06:15.160 --> 06:16.673
and I am going to crash that party

06:16.880 --> 06:18.711
and hold his feet to the fire.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.480
And yesterday's discrete web hits were over 32,000,

06:21.680 --> 06:24.672
which means I am on pace for
over a million views this month

06:24.880 --> 06:26.359
and my--

06:26.560 --> 06:28.790
--own advertisers.

06:29.000 --> 06:30.479
That's my girl!

06:30.680 --> 06:32.796
Not just another pretty face.

06:37.200 --> 06:42.115
Miss Shelley, I've got something special for you today.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.639
Think you're gonna like it.

06:45.880 --> 06:48.633
Oh my, chicken!

06:48.880 --> 06:53.317
I don't know when was the last time I had chicken.

06:53.840 --> 06:58.118
That would be yesterday, for lunch and dinner.

06:58.320 --> 07:00.709
Are you serious?

07:00.920 --> 07:04.549
I don't think that she should
have the same thing every--

07:05.080 --> 07:08.755
You think of anything else gonna make her that happy?

07:19.560 --> 07:22.358
Is it okay if I help?

07:22.560 --> 07:26.394
Oh, alright, alright.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.433
You're new here, aren't you?

07:31.640 --> 07:33.073
It's me, Mom.

07:33.280 --> 07:36.078
Mina, your daughter.

07:39.760 --> 07:43.036
I'm sorry, I don't--

07:43.240 --> 07:46.869
It's okay, it's okay.

07:49.920 --> 07:54.869
I don't see a ring.

07:55.080 --> 07:57.799
It's complicated.

08:24.920 --> 08:28.276
I am Professor Radisson and this is Philosophy 150,

08:28.520 --> 08:31.193
Introduction to Philosophical Thought.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.874
If either of those facts is news to you,

08:34.080 --> 08:38.517
then now would be your turn to leave.

08:42.039 --> 08:43.438
I understand some of you are here

08:43.640 --> 08:47.918
to satisfy your Liberal Arts elective requirements.

08:48.120 --> 08:50.111
If you're looking for an easy grade without much work,

08:50.320 --> 08:53.312
well, then now would be your turn to leave.

08:53.520 --> 08:55.272
See, you've now enrolled at a university.

08:55.480 --> 08:58.916
You'll be expected to produce
university-level work.

08:59.120 --> 09:02.317
Pfft, I'm out.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.755
There's always one.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.679
Michel Foucault, Bertrand Russel,

09:12.880 --> 09:15.713
Ludwig Feuerbach, Bertolt Brecht,

09:15.920 --> 09:18.229
Friedrich Nietzsche, Ayn Rand, George Santayana,

09:18.440 --> 09:20.795
Democritus, Denis Diderot, David Hume,

09:21.000 --> 09:23.673
John Stuart Mill, Albert Camus, Richard Dawkins,

09:23.880 --> 09:26.599
Sigmund Freud, Noam Chomsky.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.756
The list goes on.

09:29.000 --> 09:33.073
Philosophers, poets, scientists, authors,

09:33.280 --> 09:37.353
towering intellects, all of them.

09:37.560 --> 09:43.715
But what do they all have in common?

09:44.800 --> 09:46.199
Yes?

09:46.400 --> 09:48.277
They're all dead.

09:48.520 --> 09:51.080
Well, that would be incorrect.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.955
Mr. Dawkins and Mr. Chomsky are
still very much alive, Mister--

09:55.160 --> 09:58.789
G-dog Gerard Trigga.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.831
G-dog.

10:01.040 --> 10:03.508
Anyone else?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.359
No one?

10:06.560 --> 10:13.193
Well, they are,
or were... atheists.

10:14.320 --> 10:18.279
Based on the 16th-century
French "athÃ©isme,"

10:18.480 --> 10:20.198
from the Greek "theos," meaning "God,"

10:20.400 --> 10:21.833
and from the prefix "a,"

10:22.040 --> 10:23.758
meaning, as it always
does in Greek, "without."

10:23.960 --> 10:26.030
In short, each of the thinkers I named

10:26.240 --> 10:28.834
took the strong position that there is no God,

10:29.040 --> 10:31.634
as opposed to the weak position of agnosticism.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.832
"Gnostic," from the Greek "gnosos," to know,

10:35.040 --> 10:36.837
and again, with the prefix "a" meaning to not know,

10:37.040 --> 10:44.071
or more accurately, to doubt the
existence of a supreme being.

10:45.640 --> 10:49.189
This semester, I propose that we refuse

10:49.400 --> 10:52.392
to waste our limited time together debating the existence

10:52.600 --> 10:56.354
of the big man in the sky, the myth of a benevolent,

10:56.560 --> 10:59.996
all-powerful,
supernatural being.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.873
- Hey!
- How was your flight?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.672
- Wonderful.
- Wonderful?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.279
It's like
a 30-hour flight.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.238
Thirty-six.

11:15.480 --> 11:16.879
Great to see you.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.718
Nice to see you.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.914
Dakar to Zurich, Zurich to Frankfurt,

11:22.120 --> 11:23.678
an 8-hour layover,

11:23.880 --> 11:25.996
and direct to Carter International.

11:26.240 --> 11:31.633
Ugh, how does that translate as wonderful?

11:31.840 --> 11:37.278
I'm happy, I'm safe, and now I'm here because God is good.

11:37.480 --> 11:38.913
All the time.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.519
And all the time?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.352
God is good.

11:43.120 --> 11:46.112
God is dead.

11:46.320 --> 11:48.390
This is, of course, a metaphor,

11:48.640 --> 11:54.078
but an illustrative one meaning
not that God has somehow died,

11:54.280 --> 11:57.590
but rather that he never existed in the first place,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.439
other than in the depths of our forebears' imaginations.

12:00.640 --> 12:04.349
He was a useful fairy tale in ages gone by,

12:04.560 --> 12:08.439
when his fiery anger was used to explain away plagues

12:08.640 --> 12:10.437
and crop failures, diseases and disasters,

12:10.640 --> 12:13.996
which we now ascribe to bacteria and viruses,

12:14.200 --> 12:15.679
chromosomal disorders, and plate tectonics.

12:15.920 --> 12:22.359
In short, science and reason have supplanted superstition,

12:22.560 --> 12:25.358
and we are all the better for it.

12:25.560 --> 12:26.993
And with your permission,

12:27.200 --> 12:29.270
I would like to bypass this senseless debate all together

12:29.480 --> 12:30.959
and jump to the conclusion

12:31.160 --> 12:33.390
of which every sophomore is already aware of:

12:33.640 --> 12:35.949
there is no God.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.355
All that I require from each of you

12:38.560 --> 12:40.551
is that you fill in the papers I've just given you

12:40.760 --> 12:45.834
with three little words:
"God is dead,"

12:46.040 --> 12:47.473
along with your signature.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.193
The sooner we reach a unanimous consensus,

12:49.400 --> 12:50.799
which I expect we will,

12:51.040 --> 12:53.156
I will be spared the tedious duty

12:53.360 --> 12:54.873
of slogging through dry and dusty arguments,

12:55.120 --> 12:57.429
and you will bypass the section of the course

12:57.640 --> 12:59.471
in which students have traditionally received

12:59.680 --> 13:05.198
their lowest grades of the semester.

13:05.400 --> 13:10.599
And when you finish, please pass your papers to the right.

13:26.320 --> 13:27.912
Thank you.

13:41.880 --> 13:43.472
Thank you.

13:44.520 --> 13:47.990
Oh, a lower case "g."

13:48.200 --> 13:51.636
Maybe this one ought to get extra credit.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.876
Thank you.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.672
Excuse me, Mister--

14:00.880 --> 14:04.350
Wheaton.
Josh Wheaton.

14:04.560 --> 14:07.836
Mr. Wheaton,
is something wrong?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.837
Yeah, I can't.

14:10.040 --> 14:11.473
I can't do what you want.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.113
I'm a Christian.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.719
Oh, don't worry.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.558
You can still go back to your dorm room

14:16.760 --> 14:18.193
and sink to your knees

14:18.400 --> 14:19.799
and pray to your bedside if you'd like.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.792
What you do in your personal life is your business,

14:22.040 --> 14:24.190
but what you do in this class is mine.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.038
I can't.

14:29.400 --> 14:31.675
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.156
Allow me to explain the alternative.

14:35.360 --> 14:37.715
If you cannot bring yourself to admit that God is dead

14:37.920 --> 14:39.319
for the purposes of this class,

14:39.560 --> 14:41.949
then you will need to defend the antithesis

14:42.160 --> 14:43.593
that God is not dead.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.791
And you'll need to do it in front of this class

14:46.000 --> 14:48.036
from the podium.

14:48.280 --> 14:52.751
And if you fail, as you shall, you will fail this section

14:52.960 --> 14:55.713
and lose 30% of your final grade right off the bat.

14:55.920 --> 14:58.832
Are you ready to accept that?

14:59.080 --> 15:00.479
Well, who would decide whether I won

15:00.680 --> 15:02.636
or lost the argument?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.359
Well, I would.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.039
It's my class, my rules.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.673
Grading's my prerogative.

15:07.920 --> 15:13.153
No disrespect, but I'm not sure you can be objective.

15:13.360 --> 15:15.715
What would you propose?

15:17.640 --> 15:22.031
Well, what about them?

15:22.240 --> 15:23.673
Well, that's interesting,

15:23.880 --> 15:26.394
but why would I want to empower them?

15:26.600 --> 15:27.999
Well, you've already won them over.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.077
I mean, I'd have to unconvince them,

15:30.320 --> 15:34.677
get them to admit they were wrong.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.240
Alright, Mr. Wheaton.

15:43.440 --> 15:44.873
You'll get 3 sessions,

15:45.080 --> 15:47.833
the last 20 minutes of each of the next 3 classes,

15:48.040 --> 15:50.952
to make your case.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.233
I promise to keep my interruptions to a minimum.

15:55.440 --> 15:57.510
You may take whatever questions you'd like from the class,

15:57.760 --> 16:00.194
but I will not increase your allotted time.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.879
Of course, you'll be responsible

16:02.080 --> 16:04.469
for all the other class assignments.

16:04.680 --> 16:06.352
But, you know, you could change your mind

16:06.560 --> 16:09.393
and bring in your signed statement at our next class,

16:09.600 --> 16:15.232
and we'll go forward as though none of this ever happened.

16:15.440 --> 16:19.274
The rest of us, having dispensed
with primitive superstition,

16:19.480 --> 16:22.358
will turn our focus to the issue of being in reality.

16:22.560 --> 16:24.391
For our next class,

16:24.600 --> 16:27.239
please have read David Hume's "The Problems of Induction"

16:27.440 --> 16:31.877
and Renee Descartes' "Discourse on Method,"

16:32.080 --> 16:35.038
to which you may add Bertrand Russell's

16:35.240 --> 16:37.117
"Why I Am Not a Christian"

16:37.320 --> 16:41.518
in preparation
for Mr. Wheaton's lecture

16:41.720 --> 16:45.269
and in thanks for his failure to help us reach

16:45.520 --> 16:48.671
a unanimous consensus.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.190
You don't want to deny your faith, I get it.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.630
So, the answer's simple:
drop the class.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.512
Yeah, but I'm not sure I can do that.

17:08.720 --> 17:12.315
I feel like God wants someone to defend him.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.353
Don't be ridiculous.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.878
I don't know, I just keep thinking

17:19.079 --> 17:20.911
of that C.S. Lewis line,

17:21.119 --> 17:25.477
"Only a real risk can
test the reality of a belief."

17:25.680 --> 17:28.247
So, you're gonna risk our future over your yearbook quote?

17:28.440 --> 17:31.796
Josh, why am I here?

17:32.000 --> 17:34.434
Hello, earth to Josh.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.915
Why am I, Salutatorian of our graduating class,

17:37.120 --> 17:38.917
here at my
third-choice school?

17:39.160 --> 17:40.559
I'm sorry for having the next 50 years

17:40.760 --> 17:42.193
of our life planned out.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.799
That's just who I am.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.439
I don't know, Kara,
it's just--

17:45.640 --> 17:47.774
Josh, I love you, but I absolutely forbid you

17:47.840 --> 17:49.637
to go up against this professor in his own classroom.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.359
We have too much at stake.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.551
The whole thing's rigged to make you look like an idiot,

17:53.800 --> 17:55.392
and if you want to get into law school,

17:55.600 --> 17:57.033
you can't afford to flunk this class.

17:57.240 --> 18:00.277
Even a "C" could be disastrous.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.912
I don't know why you wear those heels.

18:18.120 --> 18:19.553
What's wrong with 'em?

18:19.760 --> 18:21.193
You're too tall.
You're taller than me.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.799
You're man enough to handle it.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.594
I'm just saying, I don't want
to be the short guy at the prom.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.233
Mr. Robertson!

18:27.440 --> 18:28.873
Hi, or should I call you Willie?

18:29.120 --> 18:30.519
You can call me Willie.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.312
Amy Ryan,
I blog "The New Left."

18:32.520 --> 18:33.953
Can I ask you a few questions?

18:34.160 --> 18:35.559
Yeah, sure, fire away.
This is my wife--

18:35.800 --> 18:37.153
Korie, I know.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.157
I'm actually surprised to see you here.

18:39.360 --> 18:45.276
I thought you'd be home, barefoot and pregnant.

18:45.480 --> 18:48.199
I haven't been barefoot and
pregnant in a really long time.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.833
I do kinda miss those days, huh?

18:50.040 --> 18:51.678
Yeah, you want to start
again? We can try.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.359
No.

18:53.560 --> 18:54.994
You've made a fortune selling devices

18:55.200 --> 18:58.078
that are designed to lure water fowl to their deaths.

18:58.320 --> 19:00.117
Oh, I guess when you say "you,"

19:00.360 --> 19:02.999
you're referring to the whole group of my family,

19:03.240 --> 19:04.673
which would be "y'all."

19:04.880 --> 19:06.393
You can just
change it to "y'all."

19:06.600 --> 19:08.033
That'd be an easier expression,

19:08.240 --> 19:09.639
that way it'll get everybody in there.

19:09.840 --> 19:11.671
So, y'all have made a fortune, isn't that right?

19:11.920 --> 19:13.319
We're doing alright.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.954
We can certainly buy bigger tires on our trucks

19:16.160 --> 19:17.832
and four-wheelers
to get out in the mud with,

19:18.040 --> 19:19.439
so life is good.

19:19.640 --> 19:21.278
What makes you think you have the moral right

19:21.480 --> 19:24.472
to go around maiming and killing innocent animals?

19:24.720 --> 19:26.631
Hey, look, let's just get one thing straight.

19:26.840 --> 19:28.273
I ain't maiming nothing.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.750
Whatever I see and I aim at, I shoot.

19:30.960 --> 19:33.394
When I shoot it, I kill it and then I eat it.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.999
So, you do kill those ducks?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.031
Of course I do.
What am I gonna do,

19:37.240 --> 19:38.674
cook 'em while they're still moving around?

19:38.880 --> 19:40.313
That would be cruel.

19:40.520 --> 19:41.919
That'd be bad.

19:42.120 --> 19:44.350
So, this isn't an act? You're
actually proud of what you do?

19:44.560 --> 19:47.393
Of course I am. Why would I
do it if I'm not proud of it?

19:47.600 --> 19:49.033
And you go along with everything he says?

19:49.240 --> 19:50.639
We've been married for 20 years.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.637
I don't go along with everything he says,

19:52.840 --> 19:55.035
but on the things that matter, yeah,

19:55.240 --> 19:57.151
I agree wholeheartedly.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.511
So, what do you say to people
who are offended by your show,

20:00.760 --> 20:02.239
not just because of the hunting,

20:02.440 --> 20:05.671
but because you openly pray to Jesus in every episode?

20:05.880 --> 20:08.348
Hey, we're not trying to offend anybody, alright?

20:08.600 --> 20:10.989
If they don't want to watch the
show, they can turn the channel.

20:11.200 --> 20:12.713
As far as my praying to Jesus,

20:12.920 --> 20:16.071
my life and my whole eternity belongs to God.

20:16.280 --> 20:20.956
All this stuff is temporary:
the money, fame, success.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.593
Temporary.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.279
Even life is temporary.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.232
Jesus, that's eternal.

20:26.440 --> 20:27.839
Jesus said this:

20:28.080 --> 20:29.957
"Whoever acknowledges me before men,"

20:30.200 --> 20:32.760
he will acknowledge before the Father in heaven.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.549
"Whoever disowns me,
I'll disown him to the Father."

20:36.760 --> 20:39.354
Now, those words are written in red so they're important.

20:39.560 --> 20:40.993
And that's it?

20:41.200 --> 20:42.599
That's it.
That's what we're going with.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.239
Pretty simple, isn't it?

20:44.440 --> 20:45.873
Thanks for your time.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.479
Come on, let's go do some acknowledging.

20:47.720 --> 20:49.119
You're welcome to join us.

20:49.320 --> 20:51.675
No thanks, I'm good.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.279
You're good?

20:53.520 --> 20:54.919
Alright.

20:55.120 --> 20:56.872
Who was that lady?

21:23.960 --> 21:27.350
You're beautiful.

21:27.560 --> 21:30.791
I wish you didn't have to do that.

21:31.000 --> 21:33.070
It's for my father.
He's very traditional.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.916
Who were you talking to?

21:54.160 --> 21:56.958
No one.

22:00.320 --> 22:06.953
Ayisha, I know it's hard living in their world

22:07.160 --> 22:09.674
and being apart from it,

22:09.880 --> 22:14.908
a world you can see but can't touch.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.595
I know they seem happy,

22:21.800 --> 22:27.432
but know that when you look around at all those people,

22:27.640 --> 22:32.953
there is no one who worships God,

22:33.200 --> 22:38.991
not the way he deserves and demands to be worshipped.

22:41.440 --> 22:48.039
We must never forget who and what we are.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.552
That is the most important thing.

22:52.800 --> 22:54.631
Yes, Baba.

22:57.320 --> 23:05.159
I only insist on this because I love you.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.391
You know that, don't you?

23:07.600 --> 23:09.636
That I love you?

23:09.840 --> 23:12.991
Of course, Baba.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.315
Can I help you?

23:59.520 --> 24:06.312
You waiting for someone?

24:06.520 --> 24:08.954
Yeah, you could say that.

24:09.160 --> 24:13.312
It looks like he's out at the moment.

24:16.600 --> 24:20.718
Well, maybe that's why he sent me.

24:23.640 --> 24:27.758
We are the ones and zeros

24:27.960 --> 24:31.714
The beautiful incomplete

24:36.160 --> 24:40.358
We are the future heroes

24:40.560 --> 24:45.270
A colorful symphony

24:45.480 --> 24:48.074
We are the ones

24:48.280 --> 24:49.679
I could drop the class, run away,

24:49.920 --> 24:51.319
pretend like it never happened,

24:51.520 --> 24:53.829
which is what my girlfriend wants.

24:54.040 --> 24:58.192
I could sign the paper saying something I don't believe.

24:58.400 --> 25:01.039
Or I commit academic suicide in front of a live audience

25:01.240 --> 25:04.710
by trying to prove that God exists.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.832
How many people in that class?

25:08.040 --> 25:10.429
Eighty maybe.

25:10.640 --> 25:12.596
And how many of them do you think

25:12.800 --> 25:14.233
would ever step foot in here,

25:14.440 --> 25:16.795
or any other church for that matter?

25:17.000 --> 25:19.116
Well, none probably.

25:19.320 --> 25:21.231
So, your acceptance of this challenge,

25:21.440 --> 25:23.635
if you decide to accept it,

25:23.840 --> 25:25.671
may be the only meaningful exposure to God and Jesus

25:25.880 --> 25:29.395
they'll ever have.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.079
Yeah.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.713
Yeah, I suppose so.

25:32.960 --> 25:37.238
Check out
Matthew 10:32-33.

25:38.120 --> 25:40.076
What, that's it?
That's all?

25:40.280 --> 25:41.918
Yeah.

25:44.760 --> 25:47.274
Just a Scriptural citation?

25:47.520 --> 25:48.919
If you're still undecided after that one,

25:49.120 --> 25:51.554
Look at Luke 12:48.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.557
It can't be that simple.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.159
Sure it can.

25:55.400 --> 25:58.119
You're here because that still small voice inside you

25:58.360 --> 26:02.069
isn't happy with the choices
everyone else wants you to make.

26:02.280 --> 26:04.147
Personally, I think it's the Holy Spirit talking to you.

26:04.280 --> 26:06.999
That's how he interacts with us if we allow him to.

26:07.200 --> 26:08.599
All you have to do is decide

26:08.800 --> 26:10.552
whether or not you're willing to listen.

26:10.760 --> 26:14.992
It's not easy, but it's simple.

26:51.000 --> 26:54.072
"So everyone who acknowledges me before men,

26:54.280 --> 26:58.193
"I also will acknowledge before
my Father who is in heaven,

26:58.400 --> 27:01.198
"but whoever denies me before men,

27:01.400 --> 27:06.713
I also will deny before
my Father who is in heaven."

27:09.880 --> 27:11.791
"Everyone to whom much was given,

27:12.000 --> 27:14.639
"of him much will be required,

27:14.840 --> 27:18.116
"and from him to whom they entrusted much,

27:18.360 --> 27:21.830
they will demand the more."

28:07.840 --> 28:09.273
Sorry I'm late.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.869
I had to move a ton of stuff around just to get here.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.519
That's alright.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.278
Please, go and have a seat
Ms. Ryan.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.918
Oh, excuse me a second.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.431
We've gotten your results back
from your test the last week.

28:30.440 --> 28:31.873
Okay, as I was saying--

28:33.720 --> 28:35.836
I'm so sorry.
I have got to take this call.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.678
Amy.

28:38.680 --> 28:41.194
Your results came back positive.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.113
You have cancer.

28:47.160 --> 28:49.310
I don't have time for cancer.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.919
I'm too busy.

28:51.160 --> 28:53.879
Listen, it's already grown into the surrounding tissue.

28:54.095 --> 28:56.095
Your lymph nodes are involved
and your blood markers indicate

28:56.120 --> 28:58.350
evidence of distant metastasis.

28:58.560 --> 29:00.551
Now, I've already scheduled you for an MRI.

29:00.800 --> 29:03.075
We need to determine the extent of it.

29:03.280 --> 29:05.077
I know you're very important

29:05.280 --> 29:07.669
and the world can't get along without you,

29:07.880 --> 29:09.279
but it's my job to let you know

29:09.480 --> 29:11.835
that it may be preparing to do exactly that,

29:12.040 --> 29:16.431
and it certainly will unless
you begin immediate treatment.

29:16.640 --> 29:19.438
Do you understand?

29:43.120 --> 29:44.792
Hey babe.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.436
Babe, where have you been?
Did you turn your phone off?

29:50.680 --> 29:53.399
More like I forgot to turn my phone on.

29:53.640 --> 29:55.756
Do you know what day it is?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.552
Thursday?

29:57.760 --> 29:59.432
Anything else?

29:59.640 --> 30:02.791
The 13th?

30:04.520 --> 30:07.318
Happy anniversary.

30:08.600 --> 30:12.593
Six years ago, your youth group collided with mine.

30:12.800 --> 30:14.233
You remembered.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.998
Mm-hmm, and
we're gonna celebrate.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.599
You remember how we met?

30:17.800 --> 30:20.189
The Newsboys.

30:21.720 --> 30:24.439
They're gonna be in town next Friday.

30:24.640 --> 30:29.350
You are amazing, which is why I love you.

30:29.560 --> 30:33.951
Look, I know I came off probably way too strong yesterday.

30:34.160 --> 30:35.593
You know, I just--

30:35.800 --> 30:39.110
I get concerned when outside
things start coming between us.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.117
You get that, can't you?

30:41.320 --> 30:44.232
- Sure.
- Forgive me?
- Always.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.072
Come on.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.398
I just need--

30:48.680 --> 30:50.318
Whoa!

30:51.920 --> 30:56.198
Well, that can't all be Statistics.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.038
Josh, please tell me you haven't been spending

30:58.240 --> 31:00.708
all your time on that philosophy thing.

31:00.960 --> 31:04.236
Not all of it.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.476
Okay, most of it.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.159
Josh, that's not funny.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.839
Okay, it's really not.

31:10.040 --> 31:11.678
Look, this is something I want to do, okay?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.314
I don't understand how it comes between us.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.198
Josh, everything you do is about us.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.277
Okay, we're a team.

31:17.520 --> 31:20.796
I mean, we're what, 6 years going on forever, right?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.958
That means your grades, your whole future,

31:24.160 --> 31:25.639
I'm a part of that.

31:25.840 --> 31:29.150
I don't see how this is contributing to our future.

31:29.400 --> 31:30.879
Yeah, well, neither do my parents

31:31.080 --> 31:33.878
or anyone else in my life.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.519
What should that tell you

31:35.720 --> 31:37.153
if every single person that loves you

31:37.360 --> 31:40.477
is saying the exact same thing?

31:40.680 --> 31:43.194
Josh, I'm letting you know now for your own good,

31:43.400 --> 31:46.233
this experiment is over.

31:46.440 --> 31:48.635
You need to prioritize and decide

31:48.880 --> 31:51.235
who's the most important person in your life,

31:51.440 --> 31:54.989
me or Professor Radisson?

31:55.200 --> 31:57.350
What if it's God?

31:57.600 --> 32:01.593
God wants you with me, so it's the same answer.

32:01.800 --> 32:05.156
Return the books to the library, sign the stupid paper,

32:05.400 --> 32:06.958
and move on.

32:07.160 --> 32:11.836
A year from now, we'll look back on this and laugh.

32:16.880 --> 32:19.314
We're not in high school anymore.

32:19.520 --> 32:23.479
The decisions you make now can have real consequences.

32:25.400 --> 32:26.799
Josh!

32:27.040 --> 32:28.439
Josh, this is serious.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.198
I know.

32:30.400 --> 32:32.391
You know.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.719
I can't believe I'm making a 12-hour drive to Florida

32:39.920 --> 32:43.549
to do things that seemed corny when I was 12.

32:43.760 --> 32:47.469
David, I promised my mother a picture of me in mouse ears

32:47.680 --> 32:50.478
standing in front of the fairy tale castle.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.274
The mouse ears are for me, picture is for her.

32:53.480 --> 32:58.190
To you, it's old-hat, but to me,
it's a lifelong dream come true.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.231
Can you not understand that?

33:00.440 --> 33:04.149
Then we'll go for the undersea submarine ride.

33:04.360 --> 33:07.113
Actually, I think they closed that ride like 20 years ago.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.959
And then we'll ride the world's biggest roller coaster.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.798
Sixteenth biggest.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.797
In my mind, when I'm screaming as we descend,

33:15.000 --> 33:16.718
it will be the world's biggest

33:16.920 --> 33:19.593
and I'll be glad that it's not taller than it is.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.313
That doesn't sound good.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.199
Maybe the battery--

33:34.040 --> 33:35.598
Or the starter.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.678
Either way, we're not going anywhere right now.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.636
I'll call and arrange for a rental car.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.717
But how will we get to the rental car?

33:45.960 --> 33:47.359
They'll deliver it to us.

33:47.560 --> 33:48.993
Are you serious?

33:49.200 --> 33:50.599
Yeah, absolutely.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.432
They'll deliver us the car we are to drive?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.073
Yeah.

33:54.280 --> 33:55.713
Hello?

33:55.920 --> 33:57.319
Amazing.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.158
But there are some flat-earthers out there

33:59.360 --> 34:01.112
who still consider the existence of a supreme deity

34:01.320 --> 34:05.393
to be either necessary,
or self-evident, or both.

34:05.640 --> 34:07.756
And with that, as previously announced,

34:07.960 --> 34:11.032
I will be turning the podium
over to Mr. Wheaton,

34:11.239 --> 34:12.753
who will be presenting his case in favor

34:12.960 --> 34:15.632
of a supreme celestial dictator,

34:15.840 --> 34:19.036
otherwise known as God.

34:19.280 --> 34:24.070
Mr. Wheaton,
are you ready?

34:24.280 --> 34:26.668
Podium is yours.

34:54.719 --> 34:59.077
Atheists say that no one can prove the existence of God,

34:59.320 --> 35:02.471
and well, they're right.

35:02.680 --> 35:07.629
But I say no one can disprove that God exists.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.512
But the only way to debate this issue

35:15.720 --> 35:17.153
is to look at the available evidence,

35:17.360 --> 35:19.191
and that's what we're going to do.

35:19.400 --> 35:23.518
We're going to put God on trial,

35:23.760 --> 35:26.149
with Professor Radisson as the prosecutor,

35:26.360 --> 35:28.078
and me as the defense attorney,

35:28.280 --> 35:33.035
and you as the jury.

35:33.240 --> 35:34.958
Most cosmologists now agree

35:35.160 --> 35:38.436
that the universe began
some 13.7 billion years ago

35:38.640 --> 35:40.995
in an event known as the Big Bang.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.515
So, let's look at theoretical physicist

35:43.720 --> 35:46.712
and Nobel Prize winner Steven Weinberg's description

35:46.920 --> 35:48.990
of what the Big Bang would have looked like.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.953
And since he's an atheist,

35:52.160 --> 35:55.072
we can be sure
there isn't any believer-bias

35:55.280 --> 35:56.713
in his description.

35:56.960 --> 35:58.632
In the beginning, there was an explosion,

35:58.880 --> 36:01.758
and in 3 minutes, 98% of the matter there is

36:01.960 --> 36:04.076
or ever will be, was produced.

36:04.280 --> 36:06.430
We had a universe.

36:06.680 --> 36:08.079
For 2,500 years,

36:08.280 --> 36:10.589
most scientists agreed with Aristotle on the idea

36:10.800 --> 36:12.279
of a steady-state universe,

36:12.520 --> 36:14.988
that the universe has always existed

36:15.200 --> 36:17.839
with no beginning and no end, but the Bible disagreed.

36:18.040 --> 36:21.396
In the 1920s, Belgian astronomer
Georges Lematre, a theist,

36:21.600 --> 36:22.999
who was actually also--

36:23.240 --> 36:24.798
What's a theist?

36:25.000 --> 36:28.879
A theist is someone who believes in the existence of God.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.556
He said that the entire universe jumping into existence

36:32.760 --> 36:35.433
in a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,

36:35.640 --> 36:37.119
out of nothingness,

36:37.320 --> 36:40.153
in an unimaginably intense flash of light

36:40.360 --> 36:42.749
is how he would expect the universe to respond

36:42.960 --> 36:46.873
if God were to actually utter
the command in Genesis 1:3,

36:47.080 --> 36:50.356
"Let there be light."

36:50.600 --> 36:52.795
In other words, the origin of the universe unfolded

36:53.000 --> 36:55.275
exactly how one would expect after reading Genesis,

36:55.520 --> 36:58.114
and for 2,500 years,

36:58.360 --> 37:05.311
the Bible had it right and science had it wrong.

37:06.000 --> 37:09.197
So, the earliest you can get here is 5?

37:09.400 --> 37:12.039
Okay, we'll be waiting.

37:12.240 --> 37:15.312
Wait, it has air conditioning, right?

37:15.520 --> 37:17.476
Okay, thanks.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.628
Well, looks like we won't get there 'til late tonight.

37:22.880 --> 37:26.190
Sorry, I think you're gonna
miss an entire day at the park.

37:26.400 --> 37:27.833
It's okay, David.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.508
I'm sure we can make good use of our time here today.

37:30.760 --> 37:32.193
Sure.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.879
We can meet the choir director,

37:34.080 --> 37:36.753
talk about song choices for the upcoming concert.

37:36.960 --> 37:39.758
Or we could meet the women's club

37:39.960 --> 37:42.713
about the details for the next craft bazaar.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.433
Lots of important stuff.

37:44.640 --> 37:46.119
And since you're not leaving,

37:46.360 --> 37:48.316
you'll have time to meet Mina for lunch.

37:48.520 --> 37:51.080
Right, I can meet Mina for lunch.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.614
Sounds like you need this vacation more than I do.

37:53.680 --> 37:57.036
No, I just need to do some meaningful work

37:57.240 --> 38:00.038
so that I can have something to take a vacation from.

38:00.240 --> 38:02.640
You know, some of the most important work that we do

38:02.880 --> 38:04.313
may seem meaningless to us.

38:04.520 --> 38:05.999
This coming from the missionary

38:06.200 --> 38:07.758
who literally is in the trenches,

38:07.960 --> 38:10.235
winning hearts for the Lord on a daily basis.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.989
David, God has you exactly where he wants you.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.839
He who is faithful in a very little thing

38:17.040 --> 38:19.076
is also faithful in much.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.032
God knows you're doing the work.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.879
It's all part of his grand design.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.116
All of which points to a God that created it.

38:26.360 --> 38:29.477
You see, in the real world, we never see things

38:29.680 --> 38:31.830
jumping into existence out of nothingness,

38:32.040 --> 38:36.591
but atheists want to make one
small exception to this rule,

38:36.800 --> 38:38.472
namely, the universe and everything in it.

38:38.680 --> 38:40.557
But in his book, "The God Delusion,"

38:40.760 --> 38:42.193
Richard Dawkins says

38:42.400 --> 38:44.436
that, "If you tell me God created the universe,

38:44.640 --> 38:50.317
then I have the right
to ask you who created God."

38:50.520 --> 38:52.351
Dawkins' question only makes sense

38:52.600 --> 38:55.114
in terms of a God who has been created.

38:55.320 --> 38:57.788
It doesn't make sense in terms of an uncreated God,

38:58.000 --> 39:00.036
which is the kind of God that Christians believe in.

39:00.240 --> 39:01.673
And even leaving God out of the equation,

39:01.880 --> 39:03.871
I then have a right to turn
Mr. Dawkins's own question

39:04.080 --> 39:06.275
back around on him and ask,

39:06.480 --> 39:10.712
"If the universe created you,
then who created the universe?."

39:10.920 --> 39:14.469
You see, both the theist and the atheist are both burdened

39:14.680 --> 39:16.477
with answering this same question

39:16.680 --> 39:19.558
of how did things start.

39:19.760 --> 39:21.432
What I'm hoping you'll pick up from all this

39:21.640 --> 39:24.154
is that you don't have to commit intellectual suicide

39:24.360 --> 39:26.794
to believe in a Creator behind the creation.

39:27.000 --> 39:29.514
And to the extent that you don't allow for God,

39:29.760 --> 39:31.910
you'd be pretty hard-pressed
to find an incredible

39:32.120 --> 39:36.716
alternative explanation for how things came to be.

39:40.880 --> 39:45.396
Well, I imagine you're quite pleased with yourself.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.909
I see you've carefully avoided
the fact that Stephen Hawking,

39:48.120 --> 39:49.599
the world's most famous scientist,

39:49.800 --> 39:51.756
and who is not a theist,

39:51.960 --> 39:57.318
has recently come out in favor
of a self-designing universe.

39:57.520 --> 39:58.919
I haven't avoided it,
I just didn't--

39:59.160 --> 40:01.355
You just didn't know about it.

40:01.560 --> 40:04.028
Alright, well let's see what Professor Hawking,

40:04.240 --> 40:06.356
Lucasian Professor of physics at Cambridge,

40:06.560 --> 40:09.836
who occupies a teaching chair
once held by Sir Isaac Newton,

40:10.040 --> 40:12.600
has to say about the origin of the universe.

40:12.840 --> 40:16.958
And I quote, "Because there's a law such as gravity,

40:17.160 --> 40:21.199
"the universe can and will create itself from nothing.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.231
"Spontaneous creation is the reason

40:23.480 --> 40:25.675
"there is something instead of nothing.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.599
"It's why the universe exists, why we exist.

40:28.800 --> 40:31.155
"lt is not necessary to invoke God

40:31.400 --> 40:34.836
to set the universe
in motion."

40:35.040 --> 40:36.553
End of quote.

40:36.760 --> 40:39.399
So, you may have never come across his comment,

40:39.600 --> 40:43.991
but his point remains.

40:44.200 --> 40:46.953
How do you answer?

40:53.040 --> 40:55.110
I don't know.

40:55.320 --> 40:57.390
You don't know?

40:57.640 --> 41:00.313
I prick the balloon of your entire argument

41:00.560 --> 41:05.270
with a single pin, and you don't know?

41:05.520 --> 41:07.272
Huh.

41:07.520 --> 41:09.909
Well, I mean, I'd like to tell
you I have the perfect answer,

41:10.120 --> 41:13.271
but it doesn't shake my underlying faith.

41:13.480 --> 41:18.110
Okay, so the greatest scientific mind in all of history says

41:18.320 --> 41:21.312
that God is not necessary, but
a first-semester freshman says,

41:21.520 --> 41:24.512
"Oh, yes he is."

41:24.720 --> 41:31.068
Wow, you know, that's gonna be a really tough choice.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.554
Well, I look forward to next week's lecture.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.189
Class is dismissed.

41:48.760 --> 41:50.273
Do you think you're smarter than me, Wheaton?

41:50.520 --> 41:52.112
Do you think there's any argument you can make

41:52.360 --> 41:54.316
that I won't have an answer for?

41:54.520 --> 41:55.919
I never said I was smarter.

41:56.120 --> 41:58.793
That's the first intelligent thing you've said.

41:59.000 --> 42:01.116
Now, I want to make this clear.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.276
In that classroom, there is a god,

42:03.480 --> 42:06.119
and yep, I'm him.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.515
I'm also a jealous god, so do not try to humiliate me

42:08.720 --> 42:10.676
in front of my students.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.717
You know, I also checked up on your declared major.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.393
Pre-law?

42:14.600 --> 42:16.113
What exactly is pre-law?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.753
We don't award degrees in that.

42:17.960 --> 42:21.953
Don't bother answering, but know this,

42:22.160 --> 42:25.232
if you truly feel a need to continue with the charade,

42:25.440 --> 42:28.591
I will make it my personal mission to destroy any hope

42:28.800 --> 42:32.679
of a law degree in your future.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.758
Have a nice day.

42:57.800 --> 42:59.552
- You did it, didn't you?
- What?

42:59.800 --> 43:01.199
You know what I'm talking about.

43:01.400 --> 43:02.992
You went and did your argument, didn't you?

43:03.200 --> 43:04.997
Yeah, yeah I did.

43:05.200 --> 43:06.679
What were you trying to prove?

43:06.880 --> 43:08.518
I'm not even sure there are words to describe

43:08.720 --> 43:10.153
what I'm feeling right now.

43:10.360 --> 43:14.956
I'm sorry Josh, but it's over between us.

43:15.160 --> 43:17.276
That's it?
It's just--it's over?

43:17.480 --> 43:19.436
It's over, Josh.

43:19.640 --> 43:21.474
If you're going to do something this stupid and selfish

43:21.680 --> 43:23.114
after I already told you
what would happen--

43:23.320 --> 43:26.596
Yeah, but that's sort of the point, isn't it?

43:26.800 --> 43:28.756
This is something that's important to me, right,

43:29.000 --> 43:30.433
but since it's not important to you,

43:30.640 --> 43:33.712
you made it a make-it-
or-break-it-thing for us.

43:33.960 --> 43:36.554
You didn't ask me, you told me.

43:36.800 --> 43:38.358
It wasn't a decision that we made,

43:38.560 --> 43:40.994
it was a decision that you made for the both of us.

43:41.200 --> 43:44.033
Well, somebody had to.

43:46.400 --> 43:47.833
Okay.

43:48.040 --> 43:50.156
That's it? "Okay"?

43:50.360 --> 43:52.032
It's not what I want.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.754
Honestly, I'm still hoping you'll change your mind, right,

43:54.960 --> 43:56.552
but I have to do this thing.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.796
I feel like it's something that God wants me to do.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.833
I can't just turn away from it, especially not now,

44:02.040 --> 44:03.996
now that I've started.

44:04.240 --> 44:07.277
My mother was so right about you.

44:07.480 --> 44:10.233
I just wish I'd had the sense to listen.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.799
Oh picture it, a little girl,
just a beautiful 8-year-old

44:38.000 --> 44:41.117
Trying to live through this life in a crazy world

44:41.360 --> 44:42.759
Hey, Fahid.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.157
She finds herself as a teen
and her life in ruins--

44:47.960 --> 44:50.394
Showed that girl she had meaning and a purpose to life

44:50.600 --> 44:52.079
Maybe avoid that downward slide

44:52.280 --> 44:55.078
Would you tell her the truth or let her live in a lie?

44:55.280 --> 44:58.716
It all just seems to change

44:58.960 --> 45:02.077
When you see it
as a life to save--

45:03.080 --> 45:05.435
1 Corinthians says you're saved,

45:05.680 --> 45:08.911
and Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,

45:09.120 --> 45:11.714
that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day

45:11.920 --> 45:13.558
according to the Scriptures.

45:13.760 --> 45:16.035
If you believe this in your heart,

45:16.240 --> 45:17.719
if you accept this by faith,

45:17.920 --> 45:19.558
you see, God will forgive you, he'll cleanse you,

45:19.760 --> 45:21.398
and he'll set you free.

45:58.440 --> 46:00.032
Give me that!

46:03.280 --> 46:04.872
Give me that!

46:05.480 --> 46:07.072
You must never tell Baba.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.356
Swear to me you will never say anything.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.312
Swear it!

46:23.600 --> 46:26.194
Bottle of Cristal, my table.

46:26.400 --> 46:28.038
Yes, Mr. Shelley.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.875
I have some news.

46:42.080 --> 46:43.513
Me too.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.711
Okay, but me first.

46:45.920 --> 46:49.276
I've just been named partner.

46:51.560 --> 46:56.270
I think I have cancer.

47:01.720 --> 47:04.837
Did you hear me?

47:05.040 --> 47:07.793
Did you hear what I just said?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.195
I have cancer.

47:12.800 --> 47:14.199
This couldn't wait until tomorrow?

47:14.400 --> 47:16.038
What?

47:18.640 --> 47:21.677
How can you say that to me?

47:21.880 --> 47:24.440
I thought you loved me.

47:24.640 --> 47:29.111
I do, but you're changing our agreement,

47:29.360 --> 47:30.952
you're breaking our deal.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.760
You make it sound like a contract negotiation.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.393
Well, what did you think this was?

47:35.600 --> 47:37.079
I thought it was love.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.157
Grow up, Amy.

47:39.360 --> 47:43.319
Love is the most overused word in the English language.

47:43.520 --> 47:45.875
It's what we say when we want something,

47:46.080 --> 47:47.479
when we need something,

47:47.680 --> 47:51.070
and you're as guilty of it as anybody.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.992
We had fun.

47:58.200 --> 48:00.839
You were my hot, young girlfriend with the chic job.

48:01.040 --> 48:06.194
I was your upwardly mobile,
charming, successful boyfriend.

48:06.440 --> 48:09.557
And we were together because we each got something

48:09.760 --> 48:12.558
out of the relationship that we wanted,

48:12.760 --> 48:14.432
and it was good.

48:14.640 --> 48:17.313
It was--
actually, it was great.

48:17.520 --> 48:21.877
But now it's over.

48:22.120 --> 48:25.351
How did I not see this in you?

48:25.560 --> 48:28.791
Because you saw what you wanted.

48:29.000 --> 48:32.629
You understand that I might die?

48:32.880 --> 48:35.917
And I'm sorry about that.

49:01.320 --> 49:03.880
Hey, you're in my philosophy class.

49:04.120 --> 49:05.599
Martin, right?

49:05.800 --> 49:08.951
Correct,
and you're Mr. Josh.

49:09.160 --> 49:10.593
Yeah.

49:10.840 --> 49:15.038
Yeah, that's me,
Mr. Josh.

49:15.240 --> 49:16.878
Hey, is that on our reading list?

49:17.760 --> 49:19.352
No.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.275
Can I ask you a question?

49:26.520 --> 49:29.114
Yeah, sure.

49:29.360 --> 49:34.275
Why are you doing what you are doing?

49:36.640 --> 49:38.392
Everyone else thinks I'm crazy.

49:38.600 --> 49:41.637
My girlfriend--
ex-girlfriend left me over it.

49:41.840 --> 49:44.115
My parents don't want me to risk it.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.719
At the end of it all,

49:45.960 --> 49:47.359
I'm gonna have to work like a dog

49:47.560 --> 49:48.993
for the rest of the semester

49:49.200 --> 49:51.350
just to catch up on my other classes.

49:51.560 --> 49:54.199
You have described your difficulties,

49:54.400 --> 50:00.191
but you haven't answered my question of why.

50:00.400 --> 50:01.833
I don't know.

50:02.040 --> 50:05.953
I just--I think of Jesus
as my friend.

50:06.160 --> 50:10.392
So, you think Jesus is God?

50:10.600 --> 50:12.795
Yeah, and the Son of God.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.433
I don't want to disappoint him,

50:14.640 --> 50:17.996
even if everyone thinks I should.

50:18.240 --> 50:22.313
See, to me, he's not dead.

50:22.520 --> 50:25.512
He's alive.

50:25.720 --> 50:27.950
I don't want anyone to get talked out of believing in him

50:28.160 --> 50:32.756
just because some professor thinks they should.

50:38.240 --> 50:40.356
See you around, Martin.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.994
Bye.

50:55.280 --> 50:58.033
Hiya, Tom Blanchard, Metro City Auto.

50:58.280 --> 50:59.679
Here's your keys.

50:59.880 --> 51:02.314
- Thank you.
- Satisfaction is guaranteed.

51:02.520 --> 51:04.590
Do I need to sign something?

51:04.800 --> 51:07.394
Absolutely.
I'm giving you a car.

51:07.600 --> 51:09.192
Sign here,

51:09.400 --> 51:12.915
and then one more right there, and one more there.

51:13.120 --> 51:16.476
And if you could just initial there, there, and there.

51:16.680 --> 51:18.113
Thank you.

51:18.320 --> 51:20.311
Call us when you're back.
You have it for the weekend.

51:20.520 --> 51:21.953
We'll come pick you up.

51:22.160 --> 51:23.798
Thanks.

51:31.840 --> 51:33.239
You're kidding.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.719
What did you do?
Did you break it?

51:38.920 --> 51:40.353
What?

51:40.560 --> 51:42.676
Check and see if it's still in gear.

51:42.880 --> 51:44.313
No, it's in park.

51:44.520 --> 51:47.717
I don't understand.
It worked 5 minutes ago.

51:47.920 --> 51:51.117
Alright, well, now it's not.

51:51.320 --> 51:52.833
How soon can you get us another car?

51:53.080 --> 51:54.479
Well, not tonight.

51:54.680 --> 51:56.193
It's already after 5:30.

51:56.400 --> 51:57.833
Everyone's gone home

51:58.040 --> 52:02.158
and I'm already kind of late for an audition.

52:02.360 --> 52:03.793
An audition?

52:04.000 --> 52:07.197
Yeah, the gang and I are doing "Death of a Salesman"

52:07.400 --> 52:11.313
and it's kind of a dinner theatre thing.

52:11.560 --> 52:13.835
What happened to satisfaction guaranteed?

52:14.040 --> 52:17.077
It's alright, David.
We can leave tomorrow.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.550
You want to make this drive and miss half the day?

52:19.760 --> 52:21.591
Perhaps it's gonna rain anyway.

52:21.800 --> 52:25.839
Forecast for tomorrow
is 82 and sunny at 9 a.m.

52:26.040 --> 52:27.871
Sometimes you don't make any sense.

52:28.120 --> 52:30.111
Sometimes you make too much.

52:30.320 --> 52:33.392
Just remember, God is good.

52:33.600 --> 52:35.033
All the time.

52:35.240 --> 52:36.639
And all the time?

52:36.880 --> 52:39.348
God is good.

52:39.560 --> 52:42.916
Will you sign this saying you reject the car?

53:01.800 --> 53:03.677
You're on with Marc.

53:03.880 --> 53:06.075
It's me, dork, your sister.

53:06.320 --> 53:08.276
Oh, and this is about?

53:08.480 --> 53:09.879
You really should go see Mom.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.519
She's not doing well.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.153
She hasn't been doing well for years.

53:13.360 --> 53:14.759
That's why they call it dementia.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.399
Still, you should go see her.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.318
Claire said you haven't been there in awhile.

53:18.520 --> 53:19.953
Like it matters?

53:20.160 --> 53:23.197
Besides, I just bought her a new TV.

53:23.400 --> 53:24.958
Look, I'll make you a deal.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.196
You go and you ask her what 3 + 3 equals.

53:27.400 --> 53:29.960
If she gives you the right answer, I'll visit.

53:30.160 --> 53:31.593
That's not fair.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.199
Life's not fair.
I gotta go.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.833
Say hi to Amy.

53:35.040 --> 53:36.473
No, that's over.

53:36.680 --> 53:38.079
What'd you do?

53:38.280 --> 53:39.918
Unresolved personal issues.

53:40.120 --> 53:42.190
She's got some stuff she's gotta work through.

53:42.440 --> 53:43.953
I'm sorry to hear that.

53:44.160 --> 53:46.310
Well, that's the way it goes.

53:47.280 --> 53:49.157
Okay, ready to get this started?

54:02.960 --> 54:04.473
Seriously, you have got to get a life.

54:04.680 --> 54:07.148
Yeah, tell me about it.

54:11.120 --> 54:12.553
Hey honey.

54:12.760 --> 54:14.318
Oh, sorry, the door was open.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.516
I just let myself in.

54:16.720 --> 54:18.312
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:20.600 --> 54:24.195
Oh hey, did you pick up the bottle of wine I wanted?

54:26.640 --> 54:28.119
I did.

54:28.360 --> 54:31.397
I left it in the car.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.999
It's in the car.

54:33.240 --> 54:34.832
Don't worry about it.

54:35.080 --> 54:36.479
You have a lot on your plate.

54:36.680 --> 54:38.113
So, you know, just--

54:38.320 --> 54:41.835
thank you for helping set up our dinner party.

54:42.040 --> 54:44.952
Well, unless I'm wrong,

54:45.160 --> 54:47.071
all the guests are from the philosophy department?

54:47.280 --> 54:50.397
That's not true.
Vivian's a sociologist.

54:50.640 --> 54:51.993
You're proving my point.

54:52.200 --> 54:54.077
Look, I can't help it.

54:54.280 --> 54:57.397
See, my intellectual rigor falls to pieces

54:57.640 --> 54:59.471
the instant I get around you.

54:59.680 --> 55:01.079
Really?

55:01.280 --> 55:02.759
You could have fooled me.

55:02.960 --> 55:05.315
The first time I walked into your classroom,

55:05.520 --> 55:08.318
you were all blood and thunder.

55:08.520 --> 55:14.311
That was a performance, staged largely for your benefit.

55:14.520 --> 55:19.594
In the mean time, I kept trying to keep my eyes off you

55:19.800 --> 55:22.712
and hoping that there was a brain inside that pretty head.

55:22.960 --> 55:24.359
Why?

55:24.560 --> 55:27.279
Well, because if there wasn't, then, you know,

55:27.480 --> 55:31.439
there's no way I could have made myself go out with you.

55:31.680 --> 55:34.911
Look, as it was, I waited until you aced the midterm.

55:35.120 --> 55:36.553
It was an A-minus.

55:36.760 --> 55:39.228
Close enough.

55:43.480 --> 55:46.756
Come on, where is she?

55:46.960 --> 55:48.393
Huh?

55:48.600 --> 55:49.999
Who?

55:50.240 --> 55:51.992
That carefree,
free-spirited girl

55:52.240 --> 55:58.509
who forced me to almost risk my career by dating her.

55:58.720 --> 56:01.188
You know, the one who quoted Emily Dickinson, and Shelley,

56:01.400 --> 56:04.312
and Spongebob Squarepants
with equal self-confidence.

56:04.520 --> 56:07.956
I mean, what ever happened to the old Mina?

56:08.160 --> 56:11.357
'Cause I miss her.

56:11.560 --> 56:14.757
She has got a mom who's failing,

56:14.960 --> 56:17.997
she's sensing time is passing by,

56:18.200 --> 56:24.912
and she's starting to wonder if she's unequally yoked.

56:25.120 --> 56:29.432
Alright, you've been reading again, haven't you?

56:29.640 --> 56:34.794
Reading, listening, thinking.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.592
You can hardly call this thinking.

56:36.800 --> 56:40.554
As a matter of fact, it's the opposite of thinking.

56:40.760 --> 56:42.990
You know I'm a Christian.

56:43.200 --> 56:44.838
You knew that when you first started seeing me.

56:45.080 --> 56:47.992
Yes, and you know that I'm not.

56:48.200 --> 56:49.599
Yeah, I know,

56:49.840 --> 56:51.239
and I know there's a lot of things

56:51.440 --> 56:52.873
you don't want to talk about,

56:53.080 --> 56:54.479
so we don't talk about them.

56:54.720 --> 56:58.554
Yeah, except the not talking is starting to get louder

56:58.760 --> 57:00.910
and louder, and soon it will be deafening,

57:01.120 --> 57:06.638
and I don't know if I can put up with that.

57:06.840 --> 57:10.913
- I know.
- Do you?
- Yeah.

57:11.120 --> 57:13.509
Because we need to be clear on this.

57:13.720 --> 57:15.995
There's only room in this relationship for two,

57:16.240 --> 57:17.639
which means I don't get a mistress

57:17.840 --> 57:20.673
and you don't get to drag a
2,000-year-old dead carpenter

57:20.880 --> 57:23.713
turned itinerant rabbi into our lives.

57:23.960 --> 57:26.758
Look, I'm gonna go freshen up.

57:40.120 --> 57:41.553
Is this the same car?

57:41.760 --> 57:43.273
Oh, no sir.
No, sir.

57:43.520 --> 57:45.033
Same model, different color.

57:45.240 --> 57:46.673
The other one was a cabernet.

57:46.880 --> 57:50.475
This is more of a merlot.

57:50.680 --> 57:52.557
You know, lying's not good.

57:52.760 --> 57:55.479
Lying to an ordained minister
is flat-out bad.

57:55.680 --> 57:57.079
You know that, right?

57:57.320 --> 57:59.436
Sir, I assure you this is a different automobile.

57:59.640 --> 58:02.393
Here, try it out.

58:05.800 --> 58:07.313
How'd your audition go?

58:07.520 --> 58:08.953
Oh, pretty good.

58:09.160 --> 58:14.154
I'm up for the role of Biff,
so--thanks for asking.

58:33.240 --> 58:36.312
You guys going somewhere?

58:37.600 --> 58:39.500
How's it look for you with the department chair position?

58:39.640 --> 58:41.631
I'm up for review
mid-semester.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.831
Dean Powell assures me it's a slam dunk.

58:44.080 --> 58:46.799
Well, congratulations Jeffrey.

58:47.040 --> 58:50.112
Anything else on your plate?

58:50.320 --> 58:52.197
Not really.

58:52.400 --> 58:57.076
Feel like sharing?

58:57.280 --> 59:01.876
I've got this student in my
introductory class this semester

59:02.080 --> 59:04.594
who's--well,
he's taken a challenge

59:04.800 --> 59:07.553
to prove the existence of God.

59:07.760 --> 59:09.159
In your classroom?

59:09.360 --> 59:12.113
- Yes.
- Silly boy.

59:12.360 --> 59:14.430
- Freshman?
- Oh yeah.

59:14.640 --> 59:16.551
Doesn't seem quite fair to me.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.159
Well, how's that?

59:18.400 --> 59:20.436
He's inexperienced in front of a room,

59:20.640 --> 59:22.107
and you're expecting him to compete with you

59:22.280 --> 59:23.838
in your own field of expertise.

59:24.080 --> 59:26.310
Come on, Mina.
This is fun for me.

59:26.520 --> 59:29.193
I can't help it if a boy wants to make a fool of himself

59:29.400 --> 59:31.311
and commit academic suicide.

59:31.520 --> 59:32.953
Look, I tried to stop him.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.752
I gave him an out, but no, no, no,

59:35.000 --> 59:37.560
he wants to prove that God isn't dead.

59:39.840 --> 59:43.753
Look, I know I am in the minority here,

59:43.960 --> 59:46.713
but I actually believe in God.

59:52.320 --> 59:55.915
Yes, yes, well, she is--
she's a work in progress.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.910
So, darling, I think it's best we just change the subject.

01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.553
But I'm just saying--

01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.719
Mina, I've asked politely, okay?

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.438
Okay.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.799
The coq au vin is almost done.

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.712
Excellent.

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.632
To the dining room.

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.594
Nothing like a nice merlot to take the edge off.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.514
Cheers, everyone.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.478
Mina, this wine is awful.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.119
It's been cooked.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:13.153
It tastes like it was sunning in a moldy basement.

01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:15.112
Talk about your
"Grapes of Wrath."

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.878
I bought it before I went shopping the other day.

01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:26.958
I locked it in the trunk

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.873
and when I got home I forgot about it.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:33.590
Well, I think this dinner serves as a valuable lesson.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:36.189
As Socrates put it over 2,000 years ago,

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:39.153
"Gnothi seauton."

01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:44.514
Looks like it's Greek to her.

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.718
Oh, it's "Know thyself," darling, know thyself.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.199
Which I suggest means knowing your own limitations.

01:02:01.160 --> 01:02:06.075
You know, if you'll all excuse me,

01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:09.232
it's time for the help to depart.

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:11.271
Sweetheart--

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:43.952
No pacemaker?

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:47.357
No other piercings, right?

01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:48.959
No.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:51.589
I know it sounds crazy, but I have to ask.

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.634
If there's any ferrous metal anywhere inside your body,

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.235
the magnetic field will put it out, and forcibly.

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.557
In our last class, I was asked a question

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.360
that I couldn't answer.

01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:13.949
As Professor Radisson pointed out,

01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:16.071
Stephen Hawking is an atheist.

01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:17.918
He also wrote a book called "The Grand Design"

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:22.750
in which he says the following:

01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.076
"Because there is a law such as gravity,

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.677
the universe can and will
create itself from nothing."

01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:33.395
And to be honest, I didn't know how to refute that.

01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:40.392
I mean, after all, Hawking is clearly a genius.

01:03:40.600 --> 01:03:43.068
But, Professor John Lennox,

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:44.679
who teaches mathematics and philosophy

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.639
has demonstrated that there are not one, even two,

01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:50.030
but three errors of logic contained

01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.719
in that one simple sentence,

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:55.549
and it all boils down to circular reasoning.

01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.320
Hawking is basically saying that the universe exists

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.710
because the universe needed to exist,

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.319
and because the universe needed to exist,

01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:05.438
it therefore created itself.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:07.039
It's like this.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.872
If I say to you that I can prove

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:10.991
that Spam is the best-tasting
food that's ever existed

01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:14.596
because in all of history, no food has ever tasted better,

01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.233
you'd probably look at me strange

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:17.839
and say I haven't proven anything.

01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:19.479
And you'd be right,

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:21.796
all I've done is restate my original claim.

01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.907
But when Hawking claims that the universe created itself

01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.190
because it needed to create itself,

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.231
and then offers that as an explanation

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:30.510
as to how and why it was created,

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.911
we don't immediately recognize
that he's doing the same thing.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:37.271
But he is, prompting Lennox to further comment,

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.959
"Nonsense remains nonsense,

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.879
"even when spoken by famous scientists

01:04:42.080 --> 01:04:43.559
"even though the general public

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.159
assumes they are
statements of science."

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.879
This is the height of hubris.

01:04:47.080 --> 01:04:48.513
Are you telling me that you, a freshman,

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:50.597
are saying that Stephen Hawking is wrong?

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.917
No, what I'm saying is that John Lennox,

01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:55.561
a professor of mathematics and philosophy,

01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.716
has found Professor Hawking's reasoning to be faulty,

01:04:57.920 --> 01:04:59.512
and I agree with his logic.

01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.188
But if you can't bear to disagree

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.799
with Hawking's thinking,

01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.270
then I suggest that you turn to page five of his book,

01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:10.314
where he insists philosophy is dead.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:12.838
And if you're so sure

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.439
of Professor Hawking's infallibility,

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.079
and philosophy really is dead,

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:22.116
then well, there's really no need for this class.

01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:29.559
It's like I'm a convenience to him,

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.320
except for when my faith comes up,

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:34.476
then he becomes verbally abusive.

01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:36.716
I'm guessing he's bright.

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:38.353
Brilliant.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:40.073
Handsome.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:41.679
Yes.

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.348
And his attention makes you feel special,

01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:46.835
gives you a sense of completeness.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:49.435
Have you been reading my diary?

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:52.074
Psychologists call it the Cinderella complex.

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.033
It's not my name for it, so don't get upset with me.

01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.514
Guys are capable of the same thing.

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.796
It's just they don't have a name for it.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.567
But in essence, you're looking for his approval

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.073
to give you
a sense of self-worth

01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:04.316
instead of generating it internally.

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.152
Don't most people do that?

01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.749
Yeah, a lot of people do, sure.

01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.598
But, using romance
to shore up self-image

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.473
is an unstable foundation.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.911
Do you believe God's capable
of error, bias, or bad judgment?

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.553
No.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.479
So, if he's incapable of mistakes,

01:06:21.680 --> 01:06:25.673
and he made you in his likeness and image,

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:28.394
then it follows that he cares about you, right?

01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:30.318
Right.

01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:31.999
To the point where God's only Son

01:06:32.200 --> 01:06:36.557
would willingly be crucified again for you, just you,

01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:38.597
if that's what was necessary.

01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:41.308
Well, if he loves you that much,

01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:45.832
who cares what your boyfriend thinks?

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:51.717
To the wrong person, you'll never have any worth.

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:58.632
But to the right person, you'll mean everything.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.468
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.752
for the last 150 years, Darwinists have been saying

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.594
that God is unnecessary to explain man's existence

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:14.189
and that evolution replaces God,

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.277
but evolution only tells you what happens

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.198
once you have life.

01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.550
So, where did that something that's alive come from?

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.870
Well, Darwin never really addressed it.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.230
He assumed maybe some lightning hit a stagnant pool

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:26.873
full of the right kind of chemicals

01:07:27.080 --> 01:07:29.514
and bingo, a living something.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:32.154
But it's just not that simple.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.472
You see, Darwin claimed that the
ancestry of all living things

01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:38.877
came from that one single, simple organism

01:07:39.080 --> 01:07:41.435
which reproduced and was slowly modified over time

01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.790
into the complex life forms we view today.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.753
Which is why, after contemplating his own theory,

01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.315
Darwin uttered his famous statement,

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.272
"Natura non facit saltum,"

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:56.713
meaning,
"Nature does not jump."

01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.951
Well, as noted author Lee Strobel pointed out,

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:02.197
that if you can picture
the entire 3.8 billion years

01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.436
that scientists say life has been around

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.113
as one 24-hour day,

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.788
in the space of just about 90 seconds,

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.991
most major animal groups suddenly appear

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.633
in the forms in which they currently hold.

01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:15.149
Not slowly and steadily as Darein predicted,

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:19.791
but in evolutionary terms, almost instantly.

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.992
So, "nature does not jump" becomes

01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:26.915
"nature makes
a giant leap."

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.196
So, how do theists explain this sudden outburst

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.755
of new biological information?

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.594
"And God said, 'Let the water teem with living creatures

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:36.233
"'and let birds fly above the earth

01:08:36.439 --> 01:08:37.997
across the expanse
of the sky.'

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:39.837
"So God created the great creatures of the sea

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.439
"and every living and moving thing

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.118
"with which the water teems,

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.752
"according to its kind.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.830
And God saw that it
was good," Genesis 1:20.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.598
In other words, creation happened

01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:54.518
because God said it should happen.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.233
And even what looks, to our eyes,

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.995
to be a blind, unguided process

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:05.558
could really be divinely controlled from start to finish.

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:17.758
Isn't there anyone you'd like
to have here with you for this?

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:23.596
No, there's nobody.

01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:05.116
Lies, lies, and more lies.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:07.276
It's easy to dismiss what you don't understand

01:10:07.480 --> 01:10:09.232
or what you don't want to understand.

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:15.072
There it is, the default setting of the Bible-thumper.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:19.398
"If only you would open the Scripture and read,

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.478
then you would understand."

01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:27.470
So says the brave young freshman.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.630
"For thou art wise, and with thou, all wisdom shall die,"

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.673
Job 12, verse 2.

01:10:36.880 --> 01:10:38.711
What else does Job tell us?

01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.430
"For man who is born of woman is few of days,

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:44.073
"and full of trouble.

01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.919
"He comes forth like a shadow and does not continue.

01:10:47.120 --> 01:10:51.033
"So man lies down, and does not rise

01:10:51.240 --> 01:10:54.391
'til the heavens
are no more."

01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.317
Well, at least he got that part right.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:03.791
What happened to you?

01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:16.638
When a 12-year-old watches
his mother dying of cancer,

01:11:16.840 --> 01:11:20.753
it's only natural to beg God for her life.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.911
He'll promise anything

01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:25.554
to his make-believe
grandfather in the sky,

01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.711
including to love and worship him forever,

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:33.870
if only he will spare her.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:36.435
Sometimes the answer is no.

01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.195
Tell that to me the day you lose someone you love.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.237
She died believing a lie.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:44.436
She died believing that someone out there loved her

01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:48.952
even while he was strangling her to death.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.358
A God who would allow that is not worth believing in.

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:58.111
That is why, Wheaton, you will find

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:03.394
the most committed atheists were once Christians,

01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:05.352
but we took the blinders off.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.599
We saw the world for what it truly is.

01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:13.435
You see, Shakespeare had it right.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:17.753
Life is really a tale told by an idiot,

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:23.637
full of sound and fury, and signifying nothing.

01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.911
Ayisha!

01:12:56.120 --> 01:13:00.352
"He's the one god
who has not begotten."

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:02.636
Say it!

01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:04.717
I command you to say it!

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.353
No, Baba.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.757
Jesus is my Lord and Savior and
he died to save me from my sins.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.393
No!

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.594
Carry on, carry on

01:13:21.280 --> 01:13:26.513
What I know is you, my God, are real

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:33.751
No matter how I feel, you've never let me go

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:40.631
And what I know is there will never be a day

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:43.877
You aren't just a breath away

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:52.080
And through it all I've gotta hold to what I know

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:59.598
Gonna hold to what I know

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:08.150
What I know

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.555
What I know

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:58.868
Sorry for the delay in posting my interview.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.119
It's been a rough week.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:09.475
When I finally caught up to--

01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.272
New post.

01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:27.076
I have cancer.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:34.152
Amy is going to die.

01:15:51.720 --> 01:15:54.234
No!

01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:33.311
Jeffrey, I need to talk to you.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.993
You know how I feel about that.

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.556
On campus, I'm Professor Radisson, okay?

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:42.435
So, then he claims that Dawkins
is the one who was in error,

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.518
as if Dawkins thought--

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:49.269
Jeffrey, I'm leaving you.

01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:54.198
Excuse me.

01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.072
What?

01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.430
What are you saying?

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:01.438
I'm leaving you.

01:17:01.640 --> 01:17:03.232
You can't do that.

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.715
I won't accept it.

01:17:05.920 --> 01:17:09.913
I'm sorry.

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.721
I said I don't accept that.

01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:14.672
I won't allow it.

01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:23.029
I know, I heard you, but it's not your choice.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:27.359
Good bye, Jeffrey.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:47.471
How long has she been hiding her faith?

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.234
About a year.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.194
I can't even imagine what she must be feeling.

01:17:56.800 --> 01:18:01.476
You asked to be in the trenches, David.

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.834
What have I done, Pastor Dave?

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.632
I've lost everything.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:31.832
What if I made a mistake?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.670
Ayisha, you've displayed an amazing amount of courage

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:42.633
by standing up for your faith.

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:47.914
God knows the risks you've taken and he will honor that.

01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.550
I don't think I can do this.

01:18:53.760 --> 01:19:00.108
We're here for you, Ayisha.

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:06.395
Are you--have you read of the Apostle Paul?

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.955
He said, "I know what it is to have little,

01:19:09.160 --> 01:19:12.118
"and I know what it is to have plenty.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.880
"ln any and all circumstances,

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.071
"I have learned the secret
of being well-fed

01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:18.952
"and of being hungry,

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:24.359
"of having plenty and of being in need.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.959
I can do all things--"

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:31.075
"Through Christ
who strengthens me."

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:35.108
Right.

01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.517
You're not alone, Ayisha.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:42.110
You're gonna be okay.

01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:30.837
I made a mistake with you,

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.678
Letting you speak in front of my classroom

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:35.519
and spew your propaganda.

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.278
But today, we're gonna change things up a bit.

01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.599
Evil.

01:20:51.800 --> 01:20:55.998
Now, it's been said that evil
is atheism's most potent weapon

01:20:56.240 --> 01:20:58.470
against the Christian faith, and it is.

01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:01.478
After all, the very existence of evil begs the question,

01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:05.753
"If God is all-good
and God is all-powerful,

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.151
why does he allow
evil to exist?."

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:16.869
The answer at its core is
remarkably simple: free will.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:19.640
God allows evil to exist because of free will.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:22.354
From the Christian standpoint,
God tolerates evil in this world

01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:24.192
on a temporary basis so that one day,

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.476
those who choose to love him freely

01:21:26.680 --> 01:21:28.875
will dwell with him in heaven,
free from the influence of evil,

01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:31.799
but with their free will in tact.

01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.028
In other words, God's intention concerning evil

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.872
is to one day destroy it.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.680
Well, how convenient.

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.555
"One day, I will get rid of all the evil in the world.

01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:48.718
"But until then, you just have to deal with all the wars,

01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.589
"and Holocausts, tsunamis, poverty, starvation, and AIDS.

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:54.717
Have a nice life."

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.639
Next, he'll be lecturing us on moral absolutes.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:21:59.319
But why not?

01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:02.512
Professor Radisson, who's clearly an atheist,

01:22:02.720 --> 01:22:04.119
doesn't believe in moral absolutes,

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.880
but his core syllabus says he plans to give us an exam

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.513
during finals week.

01:22:08.720 --> 01:22:10.711
Now, I'm betting that if I manage to get an "A"

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.353
on the exam by cheating,

01:22:12.560 --> 01:22:14.127
he'll suddenly start sounding like a Christian,

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:15.593
insisting it's wrong to cheat,

01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.233
that I should have known that.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.000
And yet, what basis does he have?

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:23.152
If my actions are calculated to help me succeed,

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.316
then why shouldn't I perform them?

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.796
For Christians, the fixed point of morality,

01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.678
what constitutes right and wrong,

01:22:30.920 --> 01:22:34.595
is a straight line that leads directly back to God.

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.718
Oh, so you're saying that we need a God to be moral,

01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:40.275
that a moral atheist is an impossibility.

01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:42.948
No, but with no God, there's no real reason to be moral.

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.593
I mean, there's not even a standard

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:46.279
of what moral behavior is.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.318
For Christians,
lying, cheating, stealing--

01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.357
in my example, stealing
a grade I didn't earn--

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:52.959
are forbidden.

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.593
It's a form of theft.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:56.233
But if God does not exist,

01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:58.874
as Dostoyevsky famously pointed out,

01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:06.111
"If God does not exist,
then everything is permissible."

01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:09.550
And not only permissible, but pointless.

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:12.115
If Professor Radisson is right, then all of this,

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:16.472
all of our struggle, our debate,

01:23:16.720 --> 01:23:19.553
whatever we decide here is meaningless.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:21.358
I mean, our lives and ultimately our deaths

01:23:21.560 --> 01:23:23.755
have no more consequence than that of a goldfish.

01:23:23.960 --> 01:23:25.359
This is ridiculous.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.999
So, after all your talk,

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.111
you're saying that it all comes down to choice:

01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:30.753
believe or don't believe.

01:23:30.960 --> 01:23:33.554
That's right, that's all there is.

01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.159
That's all there's ever been.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:36.992
The only difference between your position and my position

01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:39.470
is that you take away their choice.

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.558
You demand that they choose the
box marked, "I don't believe."

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:45.115
Yes, because I want to free them.

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.833
Because religion
is like a--

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:50.959
it's like a mind virus that parents have passed on

01:23:51.160 --> 01:23:52.798
down to their children,

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:54.951
and Christianity is the worst virus of all.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.559
It slowly creeps into our lives

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:59.030
when we're weak or sick or helpless.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.673
So, religion is like a disease?

01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.269
Yes. Yes, it infects everything.

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.198
It's the enemy of reason.

01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:06.833
Reason?

01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:08.474
Professor, you left reason a long time ago.

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.318
What you're teaching here isn't philosophy.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.039
It's not even atheism anymore.

01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:14.196
What you're teaching is antitheism.

01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.032
It's not enough that you don't believe.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:19.915
You need all of us to not believe with you.

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:21.820
Why don't you admit the truth?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.389
You just want to ensnare them
in your primitive superstition.

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:26.591
What I want is for them to make their own choice.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.233
That's what God wants.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:30.431
You have no idea how much I'm gonna enjoy failing you.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.949
Yeah, but who are you really looking to fail, Professor?

01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:37.312
Me or God?

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:48.113
Do you hate God?

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:49.753
That's not even a question.

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:52.918
Okay, why do you hate God?

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.553
This is ridiculous.

01:24:54.760 --> 01:24:57.194
Why do you hate God?
Answer the question.

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:58.873
You've seen the science and the arguments.

01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:00.513
Science supports his existence.

01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:02.915
You know the truth.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.792
So, why do you hate him?

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.434
Why?.!

01:25:07.640 --> 01:25:09.471
It's a very simple question, Professor.

01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:12.194
Why do you hate God?

01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.676
Because he took everything away from me.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:18.832
Yes, I hate God.

01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:22.874
All I have for him is hate.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:33.916
How can you hate someone if they don't exist?

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:45.553
You've proven nothing.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.830
Maybe not.

01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:53.839
They get to choose.

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.232
Is God dead?

01:26:26.240 --> 01:26:29.789
God is not dead.

01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.439
God's not dead.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.993
God's not dead.
God's not dead.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:35.235
God's not dead. God's not dead. God's not dead.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.350
God's not dead. God's not dead. God's not dead.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.278
Josh!

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:26.033
Josh. Josh!

01:27:29.120 --> 01:27:31.031
Your decision to prove God is not dead

01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:33.993
has affected me greatly.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.633
I'm glad.

01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:39.276
Yes, and it has changed everything.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.479
I've decided to follow Jesus.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:46.513
That's great, Martin.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.153
Hey, you know what?

01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:50.072
You've gotta check this out.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.311
- Okay.
- Come on.

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:55.595
Why did I have to bring my suitcase?

01:27:55.800 --> 01:27:59.679
Not bringing it would show a lack of faith.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:07.514
Oh merciful Father, please allow this car to start.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.260
Amen.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:13.559
That's it?

01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:16.758
Why, do you have a better "Lord, please make my car run"

01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:19.520
blessing that you know?

01:28:19.720 --> 01:28:21.119
No.

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:25.359
So then, let's give it a try.

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.835
Okay.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.473
No, no, no, no.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:33.434
Put our bags in the trunk first.

01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:38.760
David, we spend our entire lives talking about faith.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.959
Now I'm asking you to show faith.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.398
Okay.

01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:07.310
- Unbelievable.
- No. Faith.

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.437
- God is good.
- All the time.

01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:19.191
- And all the time?
- God is good.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:36.712
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:41.675
I mean, it's not like you even know who I am.

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:57.914
You prayed and believed

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.675
your whole life,

01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:07.000
never done anything wrong,

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:10.078
and here you are.

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:16.719
You're the nicest person I know, I am the meanest.

01:30:16.920 --> 01:30:23.393
You have dementia, my life is perfect.

01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:26.916
Explain that to me.

01:30:29.480 --> 01:30:31.914
Sometimes the devil allows people

01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:36.079
to live a life free of trouble

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:42.236
'cause he doesn't want them turning to God.

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:49.073
Your sin is like a jail cell,
except it's all nice and comfy,

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:53.239
and there doesn't seem to be any need to leave.

01:30:53.440 --> 01:30:58.753
The door's wide open

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:04.910
'til one day, time runs out,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:10.959
and the cell door slams shut

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:17.395
and suddenly...
it's too late.

01:31:26.480 --> 01:31:29.313
Who did you say you were?

01:31:38.800 --> 01:31:40.199
I can't believe this.

01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:41.913
The car actually starts

01:31:42.120 --> 01:31:44.680
and now we're being
done-in by believers.

01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.359
I think it's beautiful.

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:48.079
Please, no more words of wisdom.

01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.713
But I'm just happy to see

01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:51.433
all these people going to sing about Jesus.

01:31:51.640 --> 01:31:54.108
Move!

01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:08.516
Hello, gentlemen.

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:10.153
Can I help you?

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:11.759
I'm Amy Ryan.
I write "The New Left."

01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.433
Michael Tait.
How are you?

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:15.073
Did we schedule this?

01:32:15.280 --> 01:32:18.795
No, I actually find that the
best interviews are unscripted.

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.355
So, in a few minutes, you guys are gonna go out there

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:24.199
and you're gonna sing about God and Jesus

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:26.595
as if they're as real as you and me.

01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:28.518
How can you do that?

01:32:28.720 --> 01:32:31.439
Well, to us, they are as real.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.551
As a matter of fact, even more so.

01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.752
I mean, we exist in the here and now.

01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.315
They've existed forever.
Think about that.

01:32:39.520 --> 01:32:42.398
Yeah, you know, in the beginning was the Word.

01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:45.751
The Word was with God and the Word was God.

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.033
So, I see.
So when you're pressed,

01:32:49.240 --> 01:32:50.874
you quote a bunch of ancient scribblings and say,

01:32:51.080 --> 01:32:53.230
"Don't worry,
it's all in there."

01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:56.034
Well, they may be ancient, but they're not scribblings.

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:59.357
I mean, we believe God gave us an instruction manual,

01:32:59.560 --> 01:33:01.312
and it's where we draw our strength

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:04.637
and it's where we find our hope.

01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:07.832
So, where do you find your hope?

01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.680
I'm dying.

01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:29.276
Hey Amy, you're not here to trash us, are you?

01:33:29.480 --> 01:33:31.072
I think that's what you might have done,

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:34.397
but I think you're here kinda wondering,

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:40.596
kinda hoping that this stuff is for real, aren't you?

01:33:42.160 --> 01:33:43.559
How do you know that?

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.834
I just felt that that's what God was saying,

01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.028
and he just wanted you to know it.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:54.949
That's--I can't--

01:33:55.160 --> 01:33:58.596
Yeah, and he's just the drummer.

01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.388
And we never really did what we're told

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:08.310
And we'll say we were dumb and all alone

01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:11.318
But we're still chasing the sun

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:15.638
We'll say we were young and full of hope

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:18.752
And we never really did what we're told

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:23.516
And we'll say we were dumb and all alone

01:34:23.760 --> 01:34:26.479
But we're still chasing the sun

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:30.793
One day, we'll fade
but we'll never forget--

01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:17.317
"My dearest son,

01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:20.279
"words cannot express the love I have for you

01:35:20.520 --> 01:35:21.919
"or the sorrow in my heart

01:35:22.120 --> 01:35:24.350
"knowing that I will never be able to see you grow up

01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.632
"and fulfill God's plan for your life.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:30.479
"My heart is broken at the thought of leaving you.

01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:32.477
"I know God is in control.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:34.193
"His ways are higher than our ways

01:35:34.400 --> 01:35:37.039
"and his thoughts are higher than our thoughts.

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:41.756
"Live life to the fullest and
remain in the joy of the Lord.

01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:44.275
"You will forever be in my heart.

01:35:44.480 --> 01:35:47.119
I love you.
Mom."

01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.393
Hey, it's Mina.

01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:09.989
Sorry I missed your call.
Leave a message.

01:36:10.240 --> 01:36:13.994
Mina, it's Jeffrey.

01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:16.754
Please call me.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:38.039
Hey guys, we're a-go for the show.

01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:39.673
Hey Steve, give us a minute, buddy.

01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.279
This is kinda important.

01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:42.953
- Thanks guys.
- Thanks.

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.993
Can we pray for you real quick?

01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.633
Do you mind?

01:36:47.840 --> 01:36:49.478
Cool.

01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:55.996
Dear God, we don't know your plan for Amy, Lord,

01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.153
but we're asking you would save her tonight, Lord.

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:05.354
Change her, cleanse her, give her a fresh start, Lord.

01:37:05.560 --> 01:37:08.199
Let her know that she's loved, and more importantly,

01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.157
that she is loved by you, the Master of the universe.

01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.954
Give her strength for the journey ahead, Lord,

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.833
and let her know in her heart, God, speak to her,

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:22.998
that you're gonna be with her every step of the way.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.431
We pray this, Jesus, in your holy name.

01:37:26.640 --> 01:37:28.232
Amen.

01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.233
Yeah.

01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:35.670
Hey guys, we gotta roll.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.313
Cool, you gonna be okay, Amy?

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:38.999
You good?

01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:51.873
Make a way for

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:59.110
Make a way for

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:05.832
Make a way for the King

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:13.228
The King is coming

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.709
Empty hearts are filling up

01:38:34.920 --> 01:38:38.469
Wicked ways are coming undone

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:43.714
Every eye is looking out for you

01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:49.749
City lights are burning out

01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:53.555
Freedom's song is ringing loud

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.709
Dead men waking up to the sound of you

01:38:58.920 --> 01:39:02.515
And all our hearts can sing

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:05.678
All our hearts can sing

01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.236
Make a way for

01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.309
Make a way for

01:39:13.560 --> 01:39:17.553
Make a way for the King

01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.712
The King is coming

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:24.754
So, make a way for

01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:28.555
Make a way for

01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.792
Make a way for the King

01:39:36.960 --> 01:39:39.235
Oh, that's perfect.

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.120
So much for sunny and clear skies.

01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:05.671
Call an ambulance!

01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:08.717
Call an ambulance!

01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.518
Don't move.

01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.792
His ribs are crushed.

01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:16.911
His lungs are filling with blood.

01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.758
He doesn't have long.

01:40:18.960 --> 01:40:20.393
Are you sure?

01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.999
Yeah.

01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:23.639
Don't move.

01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:25.273
I can't die.

01:40:25.480 --> 01:40:27.994
I'm not ready.

01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.237
Do you know Jesus?

01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.637
I'm an atheist.

01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.872
I believe it's God's mercy that brought me here right now.

01:40:40.080 --> 01:40:42.355
I'm dying.

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.993
How can you call that mercy?

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.555
Because that car could have killed you instantly.

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:49.399
And I'm sure right now you probably wish that it did,

01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:51.631
but I'm here to tell you that it's a gift

01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.273
'cause the God that you don't believe in

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:55.511
has given you another chance,

01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:58.951
another chance to change your final answer.

01:40:59.160 --> 01:41:04.553
I don't want to die, but I'm so scared.

01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.955
If it's any consolation, so was Jesus.

01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.670
He was so scared, he sweat blood.

01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:13.394
He asked the Father if it could be removed from him,

01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:16.558
but the answer was no.

01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:20.998
He says no a lot.

01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:22.997
He gives us the answers we'd ask for

01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:27.079
if we knew what he knows.

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:30.317
"'For as the heavens are higher than the earth,

01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:33.632
"so are my ways higher than your ways,

01:41:33.840 --> 01:41:38.755
and my thoughts are higher than
your thoughts, ' says the Lord."

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:40.632
Exactly.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.434
So, the question is--
stay with me.

01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:45.153
Stay with me.

01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:47.999
Are you willing to put your faith in Jesus Christ?

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:51.755
Are you willing to take that chance?

01:41:54.400 --> 01:41:56.789
Yes.

01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:01.511
God is willing to forgive you of your sins, all of them,

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:05.594
if you accept his Son and ask him into your life.

01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:09.594
That's all you have to do is just accept his Son.

01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:13.554
Accept his love and receive his forgiveness right now.

01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:19.278
Do you accept him as Lord and Savior?

01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:25.197
Yes, I accept.

01:42:30.960 --> 01:42:32.393
It's alright.

01:42:32.600 --> 01:42:35.034
In a few minutes, you're gonna
know more about God than I do,

01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:36.958
or anybody else here does.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:41.153
It's okay, it's okay.

01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:11.596
If you check out the screens behind me,

01:43:11.800 --> 01:43:15.713
we have a very special message from a very good friend.

01:43:17.920 --> 01:43:19.399
Hey, I'm Willie Robertson,

01:43:19.600 --> 01:43:22.160
speaking on behalf of the Robertson family.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.191
Me and the gang wanted to let you know

01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:25.833
we've heard in the news

01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:29.112
that there's been a bit of
a squabble down there on campus.

01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:35.634
One of your professors insisted that God is dead.

01:43:35.840 --> 01:43:39.116
Well, I'm happy to announce
that the reports of God's death

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:41.754
were greatly exaggerated.

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.996
Now, let me ask you a question.

01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:46.395
Have you got your cell phones on you?

01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:47.999
Good.

01:43:48.240 --> 01:43:49.878
Alright, now while this next song is playing,

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:52.355
I want everyone to go to their contacts

01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:54.312
and click on everybody you know

01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:58.115
and text them three simple words:

01:43:58.320 --> 01:44:00.834
"God's not dead."

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:03.594
And there's 10,000 of you out there,

01:44:03.840 --> 01:44:07.037
and everyone knows about 100 people.

01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.356
That's a million messages right there.

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:12.916
A million times we're gonna tell Jesus that we love him

01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.315
in the next 3 minutes.

01:44:15.560 --> 01:44:18.393
And for the young man who took up the gauntlet

01:44:18.640 --> 01:44:22.474
to defend God's honor, and you know who you are,

01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.151
I can only imagine the smile you put on God's face.

01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:29.994
This one goes out to you.

01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:34.757
It was you, wasn't it?

01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.077
The one who defended God?

01:44:38.280 --> 01:44:39.759
Yeah.

01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:41.399
How did you know?

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:43.033
I heard you talking in the cafeteria.

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.596
Only a real risk tests the quality of a belief, right?

01:44:54.960 --> 01:45:00.830
Let love explode and bring the dead to life

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:09.077
A love so bold to see a revolution somehow

01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.830
Let love explode and bring the dead to life

01:45:24.600 --> 01:45:31.358
A love so bold to see a revolution somehow

01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:37.758
Now I'm lost in your freedom

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:44.994
And this world I'll overcome

01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:48.795
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.993
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.198
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:45:56.400 --> 01:46:00.439
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:46:00.640 --> 01:46:07.273
Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion

01:46:08.720 --> 01:46:14.955
Let hope arise and make the darkness hide

01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:17.872
My faith is dead

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:23.837
I need a resurrection somehow

01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:29.592
Now I'm lost in your freedom

01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:36.708
And this world I'll overcome

01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:40.469
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:44.719
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:47.793
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:52.113
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:58.839
Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:02.555
He's roaring, he's roaring

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:09.552
Let heaven roar and fire fall

01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:16.757
Come shake the ground with the sound of revival

01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:23.957
Let Heaven roar and fire fall

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:31.557
Come shake the ground with the sound of revival

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:38.399
What happened here tonight is a cause for celebration.

01:47:38.600 --> 01:47:44.038
Pain, yes, for just a few moments, but now,

01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.596
think about the joy in heaven.

01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:50.600
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:47:50.800 --> 01:47:54.873
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:47:55.080 --> 01:47:57.958
My God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:02.273
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:48:02.480 --> 01:48:05.392
God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:09.639
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.718
God's not dead, he's surely alive

01:48:12.960 --> 01:48:16.999
He's living on the inside, roaring like a lion

01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:23.753
Roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:29.717
He's roaring, he's roaring, roaring like a lion

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:33.754
Roaring like a lion

01:48:33.960 --> 01:48:39.557
Our God is alive

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.155
This is a story of your life, a movie starring you

01:48:55.360 --> 01:49:00.115
What's the next scene have for you to do?

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:05.110
Leave the dishes in the sink, leave your fear there too

01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:09.632
Live the story you would write for you

01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:12.229
Say, hey, hey, wake your heart

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.710
And break, break, break apart

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:19.710
The walls that keep you from being you

01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:22.229
And walk, walk towards the light

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:25.830
And don't stop 'til you live your life

01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:28.634
Like someone died for you

01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:33.550
This is the time to try

01:49:33.760 --> 01:49:38.834
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:46.037
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.551
This is the time to try

01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:58.754
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:05.957
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:15.116
You can find a million words to build a wall of fear

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:20.235
Safe behind that wall, imprisoned here

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:25.070
Take that someday step today to who you're meant to be

01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:29.592
And turn your dreams to plans so you can breathe

01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:31.916
Say, hey, hey, wake your heart

01:50:32.120 --> 01:50:34.509
And break, break, break apart

01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:39.430
The walls that keep you from being you

01:50:39.640 --> 01:50:41.995
And walk, walk towards the light

01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:45.829
And don't stop 'til you live your life

01:50:46.040 --> 01:50:48.554
Like someone died for you

01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:53.436
This is the time to try

01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:59.078
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:50:59.280 --> 01:51:06.277
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:17.912
Ask anyone whose time is up

01:51:18.120 --> 01:51:20.998
What they'd give for what you've got

01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:24.749
And how they'd live your life

01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:27.713
Live like your life's worth dying for

01:51:27.920 --> 01:51:30.434
You just walked out that prison door

01:51:30.640 --> 01:51:33.598
And you'll know how to live your life

01:51:33.800 --> 01:51:38.510
This is the time to try

01:51:38.720 --> 01:51:44.192
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:51.397
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:58.471
This is the time to try

01:51:58.680 --> 01:52:03.959
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:11.191
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:52:13.920 --> 01:52:18.471
This is the time to try

01:52:18.680 --> 01:52:23.959
Just step out, your life is waiting

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:31.157
And as you fall, you'll find that you can fly

01:52:32.305 --> 01:52:38.880
