00:01.802 --> 00:03.637
Jeff: Previously on

00:03.671 --> 00:09.610
"survivor," at the yawa tribe,
Cole broke a healers' trust.

00:09.643 --> 00:13.347
Jessica's got an advantage
for the next tribal.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.182
Jeff: And got caught.

00:14.215 --> 00:16.784
It's my prerogative on who I
tell.

00:16.817 --> 00:21.189
Kid... did I chew to form a
relationship with someone I

00:21.222 --> 00:22.390
shouldn't have?

00:22.423 --> 00:24.458
Jeff: At the soko tribe,
Ryan had an old alliance with a

00:24.492 --> 00:25.993
hustler and built a new bond
with a healer.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.496
So you andry going to have to
be friends.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.563
Yeah.

00:29.597 --> 00:39.039
Jeff: At the levu tribe,
Desi held all the power.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.542
At tribal council, the game
turned upside down.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.312
This is being used against
you to block your vote.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.013
Jeff: And Joe seized the
opportunity.

00:46.046 --> 00:49.250
I got something for you,
Jeff.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.653
Making a big move.

00:52.686 --> 00:56.924
This is a hidden immunity idol.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.193
And sending a hero home.

00:59.227 --> 01:01.429
Alan, the tribe has spoken.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.996
I read your face.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.132
Thank you, baby girl.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.566
Jeff: 14 are left.

01:05.599 --> 01:13.507
Who will be voted out tonight?

01:13.541 --> 01:14.808
That was wild.

01:14.842 --> 01:17.845
All I have to say is well
played.

01:17.878 --> 01:21.849
At tribal council when Joe
decided to play the idol for

01:21.882 --> 01:23.484
himself, my entire jaw dropped.

01:23.517 --> 01:25.786
Everything in my whole world
just stopped.

01:25.819 --> 01:29.790
I wouldn't say they was like
100% team Alan, but he was the

01:29.823 --> 01:31.925
one hero on my tribe.

01:31.959 --> 01:34.395
What did you say to me at the
end?

01:34.428 --> 01:36.830
I read your face.

01:36.864 --> 01:37.331
That's all it was.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.232
I caught myself.

01:38.266 --> 01:40.468
It's too late at that.

01:40.501 --> 01:43.003
Jeff: Joe made himself
target on purpose.

01:43.036 --> 01:43.937
He tricked us all.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.373
Joe is a scary one.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.942
He's getting crazier and
crazier, but right now it's 2-2.

01:48.976 --> 01:55.749
So who knows what is going to
happen.

01:55.783 --> 01:59.253
I knew you were crazy, but I
didn't know you were crazy and
smart

01:59.287 --> 02:00.454
I'm crazy and smart.

02:00.488 --> 02:04.925
I have completely blindsided the
entire tribe with the idol.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.227
I had to play the nervous route.

02:06.260 --> 02:11.131
I didn't want anyone thinking I
was overconfident.

02:11.165 --> 02:11.799
I put my head down.

02:11.832 --> 02:13.467
That was all an act.

02:13.501 --> 02:13.967
I had the idol.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.569
I'm not going home.

02:15.603 --> 02:25.646
Every single tribal is so scary.

02:25.646 --> 02:32.620
Every single tribal is so scary.

02:45.499 --> 02:45.933
Dammit.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.235
Oh, my lord.

02:47.268 --> 02:49.303
Oh, man.

02:49.337 --> 02:50.938
My become hurts.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.940
Are you okay?

02:52.973 --> 02:54.141
You all right, Ben?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.075
Good.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.377
What was it that popped like
that?

02:56.410 --> 03:01.014
Just the bamboo.

03:01.048 --> 03:03.183
[Popping]
Oh, you got to be kidding.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.184
Sorry, Ben.

03:04.218 --> 03:05.286
What was that?

03:05.319 --> 03:09.089
I don't know.

03:09.122 --> 03:10.224
You all right, man?

03:10.258 --> 03:13.361
I'm good.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.896
I think just the leaves.

03:15.929 --> 03:18.932
I think it has a little heat.

03:18.966 --> 03:23.937
If you're a marine, you hear
a bang like, that you think my

03:23.971 --> 03:24.605
friends are dying.

03:24.638 --> 03:29.076
I feel bad for him.

03:29.109 --> 03:30.311
Yeah, that is bad.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.714
There was a bamboo explosion
in the fire, and I don't like

03:33.747 --> 03:35.716
loud noises like that.

03:35.749 --> 03:39.219
Like when they're unexpected, it
kind of put me in a bad spot.

03:39.253 --> 03:41.355
I was in the marines for three
and a half years.

03:41.389 --> 03:44.625
When you go through combat and
you come back, there is no way

03:44.658 --> 03:47.595
to adjust fully.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.363
There's things that are there
forever.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.866
Coming back with that stuff,
it's hard, and you feel lonely,

03:52.900 --> 03:56.670
and you feel that nobody
understands.

03:56.704 --> 04:01.809
You sure you're all right?

04:01.842 --> 04:02.976
All right.

04:03.010 --> 04:07.415
Other people, civilians or
whatever have no idea what it's

04:07.448 --> 04:12.620
like to be shot at or have
people try to kill you.

04:12.653 --> 04:15.356
You can't comprehend that
without being there and going

04:15.389 --> 04:16.624
through it.

04:16.656 --> 04:20.661
And so those reactions are 100%
real for men and women that have

04:20.694 --> 04:22.896
fought for our country.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.466
And it's hard to be around other
people that don't understand

04:25.499 --> 04:26.967
that.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.704
Before I met my wife, that was a
monkey on my back.

04:30.738 --> 04:36.577
My wife and kids have definitely
saved me from my demons, my

04:36.610 --> 04:37.945
nightmares, and the past.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.647
I used to live in the past.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.549
That's in the a good thing for
anyone.

04:41.582 --> 04:44.352
You have the look forward to the
future, because the past will

04:44.385 --> 04:47.187
eat you alive, but the future
will save you.

04:47.220 --> 04:51.859
You know, winning the $1 million
for my family is my goal, but

04:51.892 --> 04:57.531
there's a bigger picture, and
it's bigger than me, my family,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.933
the game of "survivor."

04:59.967 --> 05:05.005
It's about just being able to
show vets who have gone through

05:05.038 --> 05:10.210
battle and war and depression
and p.T.S.D., there's a way to

05:10.243 --> 05:15.783
life outside of all that hell.

05:15.816 --> 05:27.628
That's what I'm doing.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.831
Captioning funded by CBS
and Ford.

05:30.864 --> 05:36.069
We go further, so you can.

05:36.604 --> 05:40.408
( Theme song playing )

05:56.657 --> 06:07.701
Jeff: Come on in, guys.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.804
Yawa, soko, getting your first
look at the new levu tribe.

06:10.838 --> 06:14.708
Alan voted out at the last
tribal council.

06:14.742 --> 06:15.743
All right.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.545
You guys ready to get to today's
reward challenge?

06:17.578 --> 06:17.945
Yes, sir.

06:17.978 --> 06:18.946
Yes.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.314
Jeff: For today's
challenge, your feet will be

06:21.348 --> 06:22.916
tied together.

06:22.950 --> 06:26.720
Your arm will be bound to your
side.

06:26.754 --> 06:30.958
On my go you will slither
through the sand while pushing a

06:30.991 --> 06:32.793
ball relay style through the
course.

06:32.826 --> 06:36.497
When you reach the finish, the
remaining tribe member will

06:36.530 --> 06:39.900
shoot five balls into a very
high basket.

06:39.933 --> 06:44.204
First two tribes to finish win
reward.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.873
Want to know what you're playing
for?

06:45.906 --> 06:46.940
Yeah.

06:46.974 --> 06:49.042
Jeff: It's at hot day in
Fiji.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.545
It would be nice to cool down
with some iced coffee.

06:51.579 --> 06:53.180
Oh, my god.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.548
Oh.

06:54.582 --> 06:58.486
Jeff: Iced coffee, huge
array of pastries, plus coffee

06:58.519 --> 07:01.288
and tea to take back to camp.

07:01.321 --> 07:03.190
Fill you up and pick you up.

07:03.223 --> 07:06.059
It's gun to run right through
us.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.194
I don't even care.

07:07.227 --> 07:12.265
Jeff: Second tribe to
finish, one jug of iced coffee.

07:12.299 --> 07:13.834
Losers, nothing.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.869
Soko, you have one extra person.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.037
Sitting somebody out.

07:17.070 --> 07:19.372
Cannot sit out the same person
in back-to-back challenges.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.875
Whoever sits out here must
compete in the immunity

07:21.909 --> 07:22.476
challenge.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.377
Who you going to sit out?

07:24.411 --> 07:26.814
Chris, you're going to sit this
one out.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.215
Yawa, who you going to sit out?

07:28.248 --> 07:29.950
Me, I guess.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.621
Jeff: Chrissy, Lauren, take
a spot on the bench.

07:33.654 --> 07:36.790
Everybody else take a minute to
strategize, and we'll get

07:36.824 --> 07:39.727
started.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.260
All right.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.128
Here we go.

07:41.161 --> 07:47.601
For reward, survivors ready?

07:47.635 --> 07:50.203
Go!

07:50.237 --> 07:52.272
Come on, guys.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.677
Jeff: Jessica, roark, and
Desi out of the gate.

07:56.710 --> 07:59.179
Desi is ripping it up.

07:59.212 --> 08:00.781
Desi with an early lead.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.449
Got to get there with her head,
too.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.450
You're good.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.654
Go, Ashley.

08:06.687 --> 08:09.256
Blue out the a fast lead thanks
to Desi.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.490
Come on, roark.

08:10.524 --> 08:12.225
Get in there, baby.

08:12.259 --> 08:13.861
Jeff: Roark struggling.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.428
Come on, roark.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.297
You got it.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.532
Push it.

08:18.566 --> 08:21.735
Jeff: And it is Jessica now
getting very close to Dr. Mike.

08:21.769 --> 08:23.170
Good job, good job.

08:23.203 --> 08:24.538
Get your head over here.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.639
Jeff: Get your head.

08:25.673 --> 08:27.107
There you're good.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.141
Go, Dr. Mike.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.110
Come on, Mike.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.579
Nice job, ash.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.614
Jeff: Ashley has that ball
over the hill.

08:33.647 --> 08:37.851
Now she's got to get herself
over it.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.386
Great, ash.

08:40.419 --> 08:41.989
Jeff: Ashley slithering
down.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.091
Come on, roark.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.458
Jeff: You're there.

08:45.492 --> 08:45.926
Go, Alan.

08:45.959 --> 08:46.694
Come on, guys.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.528
You got it, girl.

08:48.562 --> 08:49.196
You're doing great.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.798
Jeff: Ashley, you're good.

08:50.831 --> 08:51.498
Go, Joe.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.666
Levu is ripping this course up.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.734
Go, Joe.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.236
You got it.

08:56.269 --> 08:57.971
Jeff: Levu with a huge lead
right now.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.007
Use your knees, Mike.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.611
Jeff: Dr. Mike struggling
to get any kind of a rhythm.

09:03.644 --> 09:07.414
Alan is moving quickly now.

09:07.447 --> 09:07.881
Soko back in this.

09:07.915 --> 09:09.349
Use that body.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.183
Roll it.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.384
Jeff: Joe is already up the
course.

09:11.418 --> 09:11.885
You're good.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.587
Go, blue, go!

09:13.621 --> 09:14.287
Wow.

09:14.321 --> 09:17.424
Levu with a huge lead right now.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.293
I got you, ash.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.328
Come on, Mike.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.796
Jeff: Mike face first.

09:22.830 --> 09:26.767
Come on, Mike, you got it.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.636
Jeff: You're good, Ali.

09:28.669 --> 09:29.236
Go, Ryan.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.471
Nice, Ryan!

09:31.504 --> 09:32.072
Go, Ryan.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.707
You got it
>>.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.610
Jeff: Devon already
shooting for leefer leaf.

09:36.644 --> 09:40.247
The other two teams will have to
move very fast to have a shot at

09:40.280 --> 09:41.314
this reward.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.817
Mike is now in last place but
continues to work.

09:43.851 --> 09:49.556
You are only as fast as your
slowest.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.960
Ryan digging in now.

09:52.993 --> 09:56.563
Ryan loses the ball for soko.

09:56.596 --> 10:00.367
A giant setback.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.869
Let's go.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.270
Pick it up.

10:03.303 --> 10:04.905
You're there, Mike.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.040
Jeff: Opens the door for
soko.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.909
Devon with another shot.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.645
You got it, Dev.

10:11.679 --> 10:14.614
Jeff: First one drops for
levu.

10:14.648 --> 10:15.816
Good job, good job.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.352
Jeff: It is now Ben who is
tearing it up.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.288
That is how you do it right
here.

10:21.321 --> 10:22.690
You're good.

10:22.723 --> 10:22.990
Yawa.

10:23.023 --> 10:23.891
Go.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.525
K078 on, Cole.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.626
Good job.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.230
Drew: The door is still open
for yawa to win this.

10:30.263 --> 10:33.633
Deferred action for childhood
arrivals... Devon misses again.

10:33.667 --> 10:37.604
It is now Ryan trying after
losing his ball.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.373
Ryan, you can do this.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.675
Control, Ryan, control.

10:41.709 --> 10:46.980
Jeff: Ryan loses the ball
again.

10:47.014 --> 10:48.949
Ryan, don't give up.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.986
Jeff: Come on, Cole.

10:53.020 --> 10:55.355
Cole is shooting for soko.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.389
Devon shooting for levu.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.025
This challenge is wide open
right now.

10:58.058 --> 11:01.762
Def within the second for levu.

11:01.795 --> 11:06.299
Ryan's tribe is still in it.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.300
Trying for a third time.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.936
Come on, Ryan.

11:08.969 --> 11:09.469
You're strong.

11:09.502 --> 11:13.273
You can do this.

11:13.306 --> 11:16.309
And Ryan loses the ball again.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.377
There you go.

11:17.410 --> 11:20.280
You're doing great, Dev.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.250
Jeff: Devon with the third
for levu.

11:23.283 --> 11:29.522
Come on, Cole.

11:29.556 --> 11:32.893
Jeff: Cole with first for
yawa.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.729
Devon with the fourth for levu.

11:35.763 --> 11:41.034
Devon could win it right here,
and he does!

11:41.068 --> 11:43.570
Devon wins reward, iced coffee
and pastries.

11:43.603 --> 11:44.571
Looking for second place.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.473
We can still come back, Ryan.

11:46.506 --> 11:49.642
There you go, come on, Ryan.

11:49.676 --> 11:52.312
Jeff: Ryan the closest he's
been to getting it over the

11:52.345 --> 11:53.680
hill.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.985
Cole misses again.

11:58.018 --> 12:00.053
Ryan working his way up, using
that face.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.521
Let's go, man.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.858
There you go, there you go.

12:04.892 --> 12:06.626
Ryan, you got this.

12:06.659 --> 12:10.898
We are definitely still in
this, Ryan.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.766
Jeff: You're good, soko,
go.

12:12.800 --> 12:16.136
Everybody got to get on the
Matt.

12:16.169 --> 12:17.237
Cole with the third.

12:17.270 --> 12:20.207
Cole, I need my coffee!

12:20.240 --> 12:21.875
Jeff: Cole scores the
fourth.

12:21.909 --> 12:28.681
J.P. Has to get everybody to
that mat before he can shoot.

12:28.715 --> 12:33.854
Won't matter, yawa wins reward,
sending soko back the camp with

12:33.887 --> 12:34.421
absolutely nothing.

12:34.454 --> 12:39.659
I'm sorry, guys.

12:39.692 --> 12:42.830
Jeff: Levu, new tribe, new
result, nice win.

12:42.863 --> 12:43.196
Dominating.

12:43.230 --> 12:44.397
Big reward.

12:44.431 --> 12:50.838
Iced coffee, pastries, and
coffee and tea to take back the

12:50.871 --> 12:51.404
camp.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.239
Come get it.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.707
Enjoy the afternoon.

12:54.741 --> 12:59.813
Good job, guys.

12:59.847 --> 13:00.914
[Applause]
Jeff: Yawa, not as big a

13:00.948 --> 13:03.050
reward, but on "survivor" any
win is a win.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.585
Come grab your jug of iced
coffee.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.686
Enjoy it.

13:06.719 --> 13:08.155
Head back to camp.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.222
Soko, got nothing for you.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.991
Gab your stuff.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.459
Head back to camp.

13:12.492 --> 13:15.662
Brian didn't this well in the
reward challenge, but challenges

13:15.695 --> 13:16.930
are only part of the game.

13:16.964 --> 13:20.700
I've been are Ryan the whole
time, so my trust is there.

13:20.733 --> 13:30.777
I need to do everything I can to
have his back.

13:30.777 --> 13:45.325
I need to do everything I can to
have his back.

13:45.358 --> 13:46.159
We got goodies.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.361
This is the happiest I've
ever been.

13:48.395 --> 13:52.332
We won the sweetest reward so
far, literally and figuratively.

13:52.365 --> 13:56.103
Not only did we have this huge
tray full of pastries, but a

13:56.136 --> 13:58.405
coffee brewing, tea brewing kind
of setup.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.707
Oh, my god.

14:00.740 --> 14:01.741
Mmm.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.376
We got this.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.677
Cheers, cheers.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.279
To the first and best win
ever.

14:06.313 --> 14:07.447
First of many.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.817
After tribal council last
night, we were clearly divide,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.921
but with this reward, it's time
for us to come together as a

14:13.954 --> 14:14.621
team.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.688
So I think we can do it.

14:15.722 --> 14:21.861
What an amazing day to have
after last night.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.966
Winning that reward, it was
just so nice.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.301
Spiritually, physically,
mentally, all of it.

14:28.335 --> 14:32.039
But it makes me realize more and
more how important it is to keep

14:32.072 --> 14:35.808
my mind in the game.

14:35.842 --> 14:39.612
Thank you guys for letting me
step up.

14:39.646 --> 14:40.813
Thank you for trusting me.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.715
No egos, bro.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.518
I think the best thing for my
game in the end would be to get

14:45.552 --> 14:46.753
rid of Joe.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.390
He's the strongest player I've
met here as far as knowledge of

14:50.423 --> 14:52.659
the game, strategy.

14:52.692 --> 14:53.560
He's a good player.

14:53.593 --> 14:54.327
He scares me.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.563
I'm going to go bathe.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.931
Ash, you good?

14:57.965 --> 15:00.500
On water, yeah.

15:00.533 --> 15:04.137
So ash, the situation now.

15:04.171 --> 15:05.338
I know.

15:05.372 --> 15:07.574
Just know I'm with you.

15:07.607 --> 15:12.479
I want us go to stay together.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.547
Two versus two.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.783
I'm sticking with you because
I trust you.

15:16.816 --> 15:20.087
After a night like last
night, I'm feeling incredibly

15:20.120 --> 15:20.988
nervous.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.722
The only good thing is that I
have Devon.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.124
We are in this together.

15:24.157 --> 15:26.493
I'm not voting with them,
that's for sure.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.360
All right.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.028
Cool.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.162
I don't trust either of them.

15:29.196 --> 15:32.699
I'd rather have it be a tie
than go with them two.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.567
Yeah.

15:34.601 --> 15:35.702
Same.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.937
Right now Joe thinks he's
finally in control, but me and

15:37.971 --> 15:39.139
Devon are still in this.

15:39.172 --> 15:41.774
It's still 50/50.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.076
There's just no middle man.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.645
How do we get Desi.

15:45.678 --> 15:47.680
I don't know, but Joe is
coming.

15:47.714 --> 15:51.451
Devon and I are really going
to work on Desi.

15:51.484 --> 15:54.887
With a tie vote to keep herself
safe, I think she'd flip on

15:54.921 --> 15:55.755
show.

15:55.788 --> 16:09.202
If not, the next vote is going
to rocks.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.338
I'm so fricking sorry, guys.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.206
It's a-ok, dude.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.408
It's just a reward.

16:15.442 --> 16:19.712
Thanks for cheering me on,
guys, I kept hearing you.

16:19.746 --> 16:24.184
I did nothing in, in this
challenge, so you did way more

16:24.217 --> 16:25.052
for me.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.919
An argument can be made I did
nothing.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.055
That's so funny.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.657
The reward challenge was an
absolute disaster.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.459
I lost the challenge for my
tribe.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.626
Let's open a coconut.

16:33.660 --> 16:34.861
Want a small one?

16:34.894 --> 16:36.463
Want me to try and do it?

16:36.496 --> 16:40.333
But at the same time, I just
have to continue to cater to my

16:40.367 --> 16:44.437
specific skill set, which is my
social game, and my social game

16:44.471 --> 16:47.774
is everything.

16:47.807 --> 16:51.111
It is built upon making people
laugh.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.313
I'm a coconut opener watcher.

16:53.346 --> 16:56.216
If I can help people get through
the day and laugh, then it's

16:56.249 --> 16:58.551
easier for them to crack open
that coconut for me.

16:58.585 --> 16:59.786
Oh, that was good.

16:59.819 --> 17:03.356
And pick me up after I lose a
challenge.

17:03.390 --> 17:04.757
Everybody has failure in the
game.

17:04.790 --> 17:05.892
Everybody.

17:05.925 --> 17:09.262
You just don't want that failure
to be getting voted out.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.198
I haven't grabbed water.

17:11.231 --> 17:13.266
Want a couple of us to do a
refill.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.434
I can go.

17:14.467 --> 17:18.204
I'm objectively on the
outside, as I am the lone healer

17:18.238 --> 17:19.472
at soko beach.

17:19.506 --> 17:24.777
I love a 2-2-1 split, and I want
to start developing friendships

17:24.810 --> 17:28.715
with these people where they
feel safe with me to talk game

17:28.748 --> 17:31.984
with me.

17:32.018 --> 17:35.021
How are you feeling, the fact
that you had sick people and new

17:35.054 --> 17:36.256
it's you?

17:36.289 --> 17:39.826
Obviously I have faith that I
can return with them for sure.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.196
I feel like I've always
gotten very good vibes from all

17:43.230 --> 17:44.331
of you girls.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.234
It's definitely good to
receive some support from Ali,

17:47.267 --> 17:51.138
some interest in working
together, and when we merge, if

17:51.171 --> 17:56.243
she is looking for numbers, I
can bring some numbers.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.346
It would be girls and then
what, Cole?

17:59.379 --> 18:02.282
Cole and I believe I have
Mike.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.416
Really?

18:03.450 --> 18:06.519
I think I have Ryan, but the
thing is it's hard because I

18:06.553 --> 18:10.923
feel like whatever happens next,
like we need strong.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.059
I know.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.028
But Ryan definitely plays the
best social game out there.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.097
He's a total sweetheart.

18:18.131 --> 18:23.436
I want to keep him because
you have to be... the hustlers

18:23.470 --> 18:26.706
were just a group of losers, but
being here I can build these

18:26.739 --> 18:28.675
personal relationships that I
know will further my game.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.745
So if I can build this rapport
with roark, hopefully when the

18:32.779 --> 18:36.383
merge does come, she will take
me in as part of their six,

18:36.416 --> 18:38.585
seven, because at the beginning
you need a lot of numbers.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.587
Let's be cautious with
Chrissy and j.P.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.423
I agree.

18:43.456 --> 18:46.125
It's very difficult to know to
make the right decision, but I

18:46.159 --> 18:48.728
think going with roark is best
for our game.

18:48.761 --> 18:52.532
The next two tribals if we have
to go, we can vote out Chrissy

18:52.565 --> 18:53.500
and j.P.

18:53.533 --> 18:55.302
If this works out, we can go far
in this game.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.437
I had a good talk with roark.

18:57.470 --> 18:58.104
Roark?

18:58.137 --> 18:59.005
Yeah.

18:59.038 --> 19:01.441
She's like, I really want to
work with you.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.043
I was like, if we lose
Chrissy, er think we'll be fine.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.345
I like it.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.147
So tell roark that we're on
board with her.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.617
The good news is I continue to
be in positions where people

19:10.650 --> 19:11.818
want to work with me.

19:11.851 --> 19:14.554
I'm going to still Chrissy
that we're on board with her.

19:14.587 --> 19:15.655
For sure.

19:15.688 --> 19:18.691
But unfortunately my two
closest alliance members,

19:18.725 --> 19:22.595
Chrissy and Ali, will never work
with each other.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.663
So I'm in the middle.

19:23.696 --> 19:33.740
And I need to tread very lightly
not to mess this up.

19:33.740 --> 19:43.750
And I need to tread very lightly
not to mess this up.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.991
Cole's eating habits are very
bad.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.226
He's very inconsiderate.

19:53.260 --> 19:56.463
He's like a pig.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.063
He licks everything.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.565
He is licking the spoon.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.033
Then he scratches between high
legs.

20:01.067 --> 20:01.901
It's very gross.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.603
Anybody else want the rest of
my rice?

20:03.636 --> 20:04.971
I'll eat it.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.607
Ben notices it.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.742
He's rolling his eyes.

20:09.776 --> 20:10.943
He's getting ticked.

20:10.977 --> 20:17.450
I hope Cole keeps digging his
hole deeper and deeper and

20:17.484 --> 20:19.352
deeper, and maybe his lips will
stick together.

20:19.386 --> 20:21.053
I'm going to get water.

20:21.087 --> 20:21.854
Anyone else need water.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.155
Yeah.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.524
Adam?

20:24.557 --> 20:28.160
When we first got here after
the split, I felt like Cole,

20:28.194 --> 20:32.965
Mike, and I were in control, but
after seeing Cole tell secrets,

20:32.999 --> 20:37.136
I do believe that Mike is
paranoid about Cole as a number.

20:37.169 --> 20:38.538
We have to win today.

20:38.571 --> 20:39.939
Yeah, we do.

20:39.972 --> 20:44.243
On the flip side of that,
Mike can keep a secret, so right

20:44.277 --> 20:48.781
now it would be to the benefit
of my game to form more of a

20:48.815 --> 20:51.017
bond with Mike.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.219
Do you want the dig while I
fill?

20:53.252 --> 20:54.487
Okay.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.590
On our last island, Joe and Cole
found an item near the well, so

20:57.624 --> 21:00.259
this morning I go to the well
with Jess cash she says, Mike,

21:00.293 --> 21:01.894
why don't you dig some more.

21:01.928 --> 21:02.929
So I start digging again.

21:02.962 --> 21:09.201
I'm going to start right
here.

21:09.235 --> 21:11.904
Cole would tell us if he
found it, wouldn't he?

21:11.938 --> 21:15.207
I'm just digging and digging
and hoping I find something.

21:15.241 --> 21:25.284
If there is an idol, I'm going
the find that idol.

21:25.284 --> 21:35.928
If there is an idol, I'm going
the find that idol.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.296
Oh, my god.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.365
Oh, my god.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.198
Oh, my god.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.299
Oh, my god.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.335
Oh, my god.

21:42.369 --> 21:47.740
I have been looking for this
idol non-stop.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.810
There's always a danger in
somebody else knowing about the

21:50.843 --> 21:52.011
idol.

21:52.044 --> 21:54.581
Congratulation, you have
found the hidden immunity idol.

21:54.614 --> 21:57.083
I'm okay with Jessica knowing
I have the idol.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.218
So at this point I'm trusting
her.

21:59.251 --> 22:01.253
Cha-ching, baby.

22:01.287 --> 22:04.090
This is for us.

22:04.123 --> 22:07.059
In reality, this idol is mine.

22:07.093 --> 22:08.260
"Survivor" is only one-third
over.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.464
But things have changed in going
from the bottom to the top.

22:11.498 --> 22:14.200
This has been the story of my
life, but you can never

22:14.233 --> 22:18.738
underestimate Dr. Mike.

22:30.850 --> 22:40.893
Jeff: Come on in, guys.

22:40.893 --> 22:46.866
Jeff: Come on in, guys.

22:46.899 --> 22:47.934
All right.

22:47.967 --> 22:50.369
You guys ready to get to today's
immunity challenge?

22:50.403 --> 22:51.370
Sure.

22:51.404 --> 22:53.606
Jeff: First things first,
take back the idols.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.608
Thank you, Chrissy.

22:55.642 --> 23:00.747
Thank you, Jessica.

23:00.780 --> 23:03.583
Once again immunity is become up
for grabs.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.786
For today's challenge, we're
going to swim out the a boat and

23:06.819 --> 23:09.188
retrieve three bags of rice.

23:09.221 --> 23:12.925
You must then push the rice
through a hole, get it across

23:12.959 --> 23:16.763
the balance beam to sure, where
you will tear open the bag

23:16.796 --> 23:18.030
searching for three balls.

23:18.064 --> 23:21.233
Finally you'll maneuver those
balls through a maze of holes to

23:21.267 --> 23:25.938
the top.

23:25.972 --> 23:30.409
First two tribes to finish win
immunity, safe from the vote.

23:30.443 --> 23:33.045
Losers tribal council where
somebody will be the fifth

23:33.079 --> 23:35.682
person voted out of this game.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.049
Soko, you have one extra person.

23:37.083 --> 23:38.718
Who you going to sit out?

23:38.751 --> 23:40.252
Chrissy sat out the reward
challenge.

23:40.286 --> 23:40.953
She must participate.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.021
Who is it going to be?

23:42.054 --> 23:42.655
Me.

23:42.689 --> 23:46.092
Ryan going to sit out.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.460
Yawa, one extra person.

23:47.494 --> 23:49.762
Lauren sat out at the reward
challenge, must participate.

23:49.796 --> 23:50.530
Mike.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.734
Mike going to sit out for
yawa.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.102
Sitouts take a seat on the
bench.

23:56.135 --> 23:59.539
Everybody else take a minute to
strategize, and we'll get

23:59.572 --> 24:01.173
started.

24:01.207 --> 24:01.841
All right.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.109
Here we go.

24:03.142 --> 24:06.679
For immunity, survivors ready?

24:06.713 --> 24:15.187
Go!

24:15.221 --> 24:20.326
Your first step is get somebody
on your boat and get those bags

24:20.359 --> 24:25.865
of rice off.

24:25.898 --> 24:27.299
Yawa doing a nice job.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.235
Roark doing a nice job for soko.

24:29.268 --> 24:32.438
Ashley is doing a nice job.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.607
Everybody has their bags of
rice.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.442
Now comes the fun part.

24:36.475 --> 24:41.581
You've got to squeeze a
rectangular bag of rice through

24:41.614 --> 24:43.550
a very small round hole.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.283
Ashley going over.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.518
Desi is over.

24:45.552 --> 24:47.253
Ali going over.

24:47.286 --> 24:47.920
Chrissy going over.

24:47.954 --> 24:49.421
Lauren is over.

24:49.455 --> 24:53.960
And very quickly yawa has their
first bag through.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.663
Soko has their first bag
through.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.298
Levu still working on that first
bag.

24:59.331 --> 25:02.101
Yawa has their second bag
through.

25:02.134 --> 25:05.337
Soko has their second bag.

25:05.371 --> 25:07.574
Levu has their first bag.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.842
Trying the stay in it.

25:09.876 --> 25:11.578
Soko with that third bag.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.278
You're good.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.412
Head on.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.014
Yawa has their third bag.

25:15.047 --> 25:15.715
You're good.

25:15.748 --> 25:16.883
Head on.

25:16.916 --> 25:20.587
It is now levu, who dominated in
the reward challenge, now

25:20.620 --> 25:22.388
struggling in the immunity
challenge.

25:22.421 --> 25:26.292
They cannot get that second bag
through.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.127
Next phase is the balance beam.

25:28.160 --> 25:34.466
You got to get those heavy bags
of rice across that beam.

25:34.500 --> 25:36.669
Levu finally has their second
bag.

25:36.703 --> 25:39.405
J.P. Heading across that beam.

25:39.438 --> 25:41.574
Slow and steady.

25:41.608 --> 25:45.244
Jeff: He's through the
first third.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.679
Lauren gives it a go.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.947
She drops.

25:47.980 --> 25:49.448
Devon has their third bag.

25:49.481 --> 25:52.585
Start moving, guys.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.452
J.P. Is across.

25:53.485 --> 25:57.189
That aboy, j.P.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.859
Jeff: Devon making it look
easy.

25:59.892 --> 26:01.460
Levu is right back in this.

26:01.493 --> 26:03.529
Cole now heading across for
yawa.

26:03.562 --> 26:07.333
Ali trying to carry a bag of
rice on her head.

26:07.366 --> 26:08.500
Desi doing the same thing.

26:08.534 --> 26:11.971
Once again Desi is making a
challenge look easy.

26:12.004 --> 26:16.042
J.P. Now trying again with
another bag for soko.

26:16.075 --> 26:20.546
You can go as often of the as yo
want.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.650
Levu got off to a terrible
start, but they have now taken

26:23.683 --> 26:24.651
the lead.

26:24.684 --> 26:27.286
J.P. Across with the second bag.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.588
Ben very close with the second
bag.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.157
And he's got it.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.959
Devon has the third bag.

26:32.992 --> 26:33.993
Go, levu.

26:34.026 --> 26:35.795
Cole has the third bag for yawa.

26:35.828 --> 26:40.933
It is now Joe working on
recovering those balls.

26:40.967 --> 26:43.302
They've got a big lead.

26:43.335 --> 26:45.037
Lauren is across.

26:45.071 --> 26:45.905
Go, yawa!

26:45.938 --> 26:47.006
Go, guys.

26:47.039 --> 26:47.807
You got this.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.909
Jeff: It is now soko in
dead last.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.679
The lead is opening now for levu
and for yawa.

26:52.712 --> 26:59.819
It is now Ben ripping through
that bag trying to find those

26:59.852 --> 27:00.586
balls.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.089
J.P. With that third bag for
soko.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.192
Joe has that third and final
ball.

27:06.225 --> 27:08.928
J.P. Has carried all three bags
if he can make it.

27:08.961 --> 27:10.562
And he does.

27:10.596 --> 27:12.799
Ben has the second ball.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.401
Ashley is first on the maze.

27:15.434 --> 27:20.807
Here comes soko with that first
bag.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.741
Ben has the third ball.

27:21.774 --> 27:24.376
They can start on the maze.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.046
J.P. Trying to make up some lost
time.

27:27.079 --> 27:29.448
Soko had a rough go of it on the
balance beam.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.649
Slow it down.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.219
Jeff: Ashley's had a lot of
time to learn this challenge.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.386
There you go.

27:34.420 --> 27:37.356
Jeff: Head starts matter in
this game because there is a

27:37.389 --> 27:38.590
learning curve.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.993
J.P. Trying to get that third
ball free and he's got it.

27:41.027 --> 27:43.429
They can start working now on
this maze.

27:43.462 --> 27:44.563
It's going to be Chrissy going
first.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.798
Come on, Chrissy.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.767
Jeff: Ben is doing a nice
job.

27:47.800 --> 27:52.604
Ben gets very close to the top,
and Ben has the first one for

27:52.638 --> 27:53.305
yawa.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.174
It's going to be Jessica now in.

27:55.207 --> 27:57.710
Do I have enough balance beam
behind me?

27:57.744 --> 27:59.245
Jeff: Chrissy drops.

27:59.278 --> 28:01.113
Got to drop it and start again.

28:01.147 --> 28:04.250
Ashley is one big move away from
dropping that first ball for

28:04.283 --> 28:04.751
levu.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.085
And they tie it up.

28:06.118 --> 28:07.519
Levu has one.

28:07.553 --> 28:10.056
I got to take my sneakers
off.

28:10.089 --> 28:12.024
Jeff: Chrissy drops again.

28:12.058 --> 28:14.226
It's now Ali in for soko.

28:14.260 --> 28:15.862
Devon on the maze for levu.

28:15.895 --> 28:19.498
As Jessica inches closer and
closer with that second ball for

28:19.531 --> 28:19.899
yawa.

28:19.932 --> 28:20.532
All right.

28:20.566 --> 28:21.267
You're good.

28:21.300 --> 28:22.368
Take a breath.

28:22.401 --> 28:24.403
Up, up, Jess.

28:24.436 --> 28:25.604
Jeff: There it is!

28:25.637 --> 28:26.638
That's two for yawa.

28:26.672 --> 28:28.741
They take the lead.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.709
It's going to be Cole.

28:30.743 --> 28:32.078
You're through, you're
through.

28:32.111 --> 28:35.181
Jeff: Ali very close now to
landing that first ball for

28:35.214 --> 28:36.015
soko.

28:36.048 --> 28:40.586
Devon close with the second for
levu.

28:40.619 --> 28:41.220
Ali has it.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.089
That's one for soko.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.091
Chrissy going to come back in.

28:45.124 --> 28:48.460
Devon very close with that
second.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.830
Devon is there with the second.

28:50.863 --> 28:51.463
Tied again.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.765
Cole, you got it, buddy.

28:52.799 --> 28:56.702
Jeff: Cole two-thirds of
the way up for yawa for the win.

28:56.735 --> 28:58.104
Very close to the top.

28:58.137 --> 29:01.841
Chrissy is halfway through for
soko, who is trying to get back

29:01.874 --> 29:02.875
in this.

29:02.909 --> 29:06.178
And Desi now on the course for
levu.

29:06.212 --> 29:08.747
Cole has passed the last spot of
danger.

29:08.781 --> 29:14.186
He can just get that ball to
drop, it is immunity for yawa,

29:14.220 --> 29:16.122
in tribal council.

29:16.155 --> 29:19.491
Cole closer, closer.

29:19.525 --> 29:22.294
For the win, yawa has it.

29:22.328 --> 29:23.930
Yawa wins immunity.

29:23.963 --> 29:24.931
We're looking for one more.

29:24.964 --> 29:27.333
This is it.

29:27.366 --> 29:28.267
Chrissy feels the pressure now.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.570
Got to drop that second ball to
stay in it.

29:31.603 --> 29:33.205
Chrissy falls again.

29:33.239 --> 29:35.607
Cannot figure out the beam.

29:35.641 --> 29:37.643
Does one of you guys want the
try?

29:37.676 --> 29:38.878
Do you want me the try?

29:38.911 --> 29:39.979
It's up to you.

29:40.012 --> 29:40.579
I can try.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.148
Do you want Ali to try?

29:42.181 --> 29:45.151
Chrissy not going to give up
her spot.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.586
Desi threading the needle
nicely.

29:47.619 --> 29:48.955
Chrissy is trying to catch up.

29:48.988 --> 29:51.390
I can't stay on the balance
beam.

29:51.423 --> 29:53.392
Jeff: Chrissy drops again.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.460
Another huge setback.

29:54.493 --> 29:58.730
Dead very close for the win with
levu.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.166
She can do it right here.

30:00.199 --> 30:02.768
It's over.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.437
Desi wins immunity, sending soko
to tribal council.

30:05.471 --> 30:07.173
Nice job, guys.

30:07.206 --> 30:14.246
Sorry, guys.

30:14.280 --> 30:15.982
Jeff: Yawa,
congratulations.

30:16.015 --> 30:16.949
In tribal council tonight.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.650
Thank you, sir.

30:18.684 --> 30:20.319
Jeff: Levu, nice job.

30:20.352 --> 30:25.157
No tribal council.

30:25.191 --> 30:26.292
All right.

30:26.325 --> 30:28.928
Yawa, levu, grab your stuff,
head back to camp, enjoy the

30:28.961 --> 30:29.962
night off.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.898
All right, soko, grab jury stuff
head back to camp.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.266
See you tonight at tribal where
somebody will be the fifth

30:34.300 --> 30:38.337
person voted out of "survivor:
Heroes v. Healers v. Hustlers."

30:38.370 --> 30:40.339
Tonight is my first tribal
council.

30:40.372 --> 30:43.876
I am nervous, but Chrissy
definitely struggled in this

30:43.910 --> 30:44.343
challenge.

30:44.376 --> 30:48.347
She needs to go.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.330
I do not feel safe going into
tonight's tribal.

31:04.363 --> 31:08.034
And I am having a hard time
trusting anyone, but I think

31:08.067 --> 31:15.174
that I'm going to have to go
there in order to move forward

31:15.207 --> 31:17.343
in this game.

31:17.376 --> 31:18.277
You guys good?

31:18.310 --> 31:19.979
I don't know if I want the
get wet again.

31:20.012 --> 31:20.812
I agree.

31:20.846 --> 31:22.314
I'm probably pretty good.

31:22.348 --> 31:25.751
You always are nervous in
this game, and I feel like if

31:25.784 --> 31:27.386
I'm going to play, I want the
play big.

31:27.419 --> 31:28.887
Do you want to go down?

31:28.921 --> 31:31.023
Okay.

31:31.057 --> 31:34.493
See that big log that washed
up, I wanted to grab that before

31:34.526 --> 31:35.194
the tide came back.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.463
Can we just sit for a second?

31:37.496 --> 31:39.398
I want the have a thoughtful
conversation.

31:39.431 --> 31:40.566
Of course.

31:40.599 --> 31:45.271
I believe that roark is in t
next most dangerous player

31:45.304 --> 31:46.205
behind me.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.208
I haven't been able to put my
finger on it.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.611
You to me are the most
strategic player in this game,

31:52.644 --> 31:56.148
and I really thought you and I
together could sit down here and

31:56.182 --> 31:57.349
talk out options.

31:57.383 --> 31:59.451
If we send a by home...

31:59.485 --> 32:00.652
I completely agree.

32:00.686 --> 32:04.290
We're headed to tribal and
today is the first day Chrissy

32:04.323 --> 32:06.425
ever feels the need to talk game
with me.

32:06.458 --> 32:08.927
In my head, I'm like, are you
kidding me?

32:08.961 --> 32:10.162
I want Chrissy to go home.

32:10.196 --> 32:16.035
That allow, you, Ali and me
to keep open an all-girl option.

32:16.068 --> 32:21.307
I personally don't have an
objection.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.475
Is that potentially a
workable plan?

32:23.509 --> 32:24.610
Of course.

32:24.643 --> 32:28.414
I was really hoping that
roark wanted to work with me

32:28.447 --> 32:31.450
going forward, but I don't
believe anything she says and I

32:31.483 --> 32:34.186
wish I could stop and say to
her, you are not the smartest

32:34.220 --> 32:38.157
person here, but I don't want
the ruin my game, so my plan is

32:38.190 --> 32:40.359
to create this imaginary girl's
alliance.

32:40.392 --> 32:43.395
If there is a girl's alliance,
then clearly I would not be the

32:43.429 --> 32:49.601
one voted out, and j.P. Might
think he were the next to go.

32:49.635 --> 32:50.769
What are you thinking?

32:50.802 --> 32:53.205
The four of us get together
and vote out roark.

32:53.239 --> 32:56.108
I think she's good in
challenges, though, too.

32:56.142 --> 32:58.944
Roark wants to do an
all-girls alliance.

32:58.977 --> 32:59.678
Oh, really?

32:59.711 --> 33:02.414
Oh, she's got to go.

33:02.448 --> 33:03.315
Simple as that.

33:03.349 --> 33:06.852
J.P. And I are two, so now I
need Ryan.

33:06.885 --> 33:09.621
I want to believe that Ryan has
my back.

33:09.655 --> 33:13.092
I think roark is trying to
get Ali and me.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.994
So they would vote for me,
because they need the keep j.P.

33:16.028 --> 33:16.928
Right.

33:16.962 --> 33:21.767
So we would need to make you,
me, and j.P.

33:21.800 --> 33:23.001
Right.

33:23.035 --> 33:26.838
I brought it up with j.P., he
really likes roark, and then I

33:26.872 --> 33:30.142
said to him, I heard she might
be doing an all-girl alliance,

33:30.176 --> 33:32.244
and then he's like, I'm down
with that.

33:32.278 --> 33:34.713
So you, me, and j.P. At least?

33:34.746 --> 33:35.881
Perfect.

33:35.914 --> 33:40.786
The plan right now is that
j.P., Ryan, and myself will

33:40.819 --> 33:44.590
blindside roark and send her
home.

33:44.623 --> 33:47.926
Chrissy should have just
backed out after she tried so

33:47.959 --> 33:48.227
many times.

33:48.260 --> 33:51.330
Yeah.

33:51.363 --> 33:52.164
Yeah.

33:52.198 --> 33:55.201
Chrissy's probably going to
say you.

33:55.234 --> 33:58.036
Let's keep whittling the
heroes down.

33:58.070 --> 34:01.073
The main reason for taking
out Chrissy tonight is she could

34:01.107 --> 34:03.742
not balance on that beam.

34:03.775 --> 34:06.878
And with her, we're not going to
be as strong in challenges.

34:06.912 --> 34:09.315
And so I want Chrissy to go home
tonight.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.150
What did roark say?

34:11.183 --> 34:16.188
Roark said we get rid of
Chrissy.

34:16.222 --> 34:17.789
Chrissy?

34:17.822 --> 34:18.690
All right.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.458
You know I trust you and I
trust roark.

34:20.492 --> 34:23.027
I trust you the most.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.763
I'm in the swing vote
position.

34:24.795 --> 34:30.101
I seemingly have the choice
tonight on who to send home.

34:30.136 --> 34:33.205
Me and Chrissy are so tight
because that first day I went to

34:33.239 --> 34:34.473
her with the advantage.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.409
On the other hand, Ali has only
played the game with one person,

34:37.443 --> 34:39.010
and that person is me.

34:39.043 --> 34:42.080
And whoever I go with, there's
going to be one person who is

34:42.114 --> 34:43.581
going to hate me.

34:43.614 --> 34:47.686
This is a huge decision, but I'm
here to try and win this game to

34:47.719 --> 34:50.621
build the best social game I
can, and unfortunately I'm

34:50.656 --> 34:54.460
breaking that social bond with
somebody tonight, but I still

34:54.493 --> 35:03.302
think it best advances my game.

35:13.679 --> 35:18.350
Jeff: Roark, grab the unlit
torch, dip it in, and get fire.

35:18.384 --> 35:21.387
This is part of the ritual at
tribal council, because in this

35:21.420 --> 35:23.522
game, fire represents your life.

35:23.555 --> 35:28.093
When your fire is gone, so are
you.

35:28.126 --> 35:32.097
So Ali, one of the things about
"survivor" is everybody brings a

35:32.130 --> 35:33.365
different approach to the game.

35:33.399 --> 35:37.536
Have you noticed any difference
in how the hustlers or the

35:37.569 --> 35:39.805
heroes or the healers are
playing the game?

35:39.838 --> 35:40.939
Yeah.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.009
I mean, I think today's loss
kind of showed a little bit,

35:44.042 --> 35:47.613
where if I was unable to
complete the task at hand, I

35:47.646 --> 35:50.716
would say, we have three other
people the make it happen and

35:50.749 --> 35:51.383
move out of the way.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.218
Wait.

35:52.251 --> 35:52.818
I did that.

35:52.851 --> 35:53.585
Are you talking about me?

35:53.619 --> 35:55.387
I felt that you started it...

35:55.421 --> 35:58.557
I turned around so many times
and said, does anybody want the

35:58.590 --> 36:01.493
take over, and you guys were
like, no, keep going, keep

36:01.527 --> 36:02.728
going.

36:02.761 --> 36:05.431
I but I would have said, you
guys tree, we need someone to

36:05.464 --> 36:06.632
get us on the board.

36:06.665 --> 36:09.000
I remember turning several
times and saying, who wants to

36:09.034 --> 36:10.001
take this?

36:10.035 --> 36:14.640
And they all stood there and
said, you go again.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.641
Jeff: Wow.

36:15.674 --> 36:18.877
It's her side, my side, and
the truth, right?

36:18.910 --> 36:23.282
Jeff: And there is a voting
booth 20 yards from here about

36:23.315 --> 36:25.651
to get used.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.620
Ryan, these are the things that
ultimately can decide a vote.

36:28.654 --> 36:32.658
A lot of the times the truth
is what you made of it.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.994
I didn't see anybody give up or
anybody controlling.

36:36.027 --> 36:40.799
I saw us trying to complete the
task in the best way to catch us

36:40.832 --> 36:42.568
up an complete the challenge.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.636
What happened when you got
back from camp?

36:44.670 --> 36:47.873
I hadn't talked any strategy
at all with roark and I didn't

36:47.906 --> 36:50.842
want to come the tribal council
and never have had a

36:50.876 --> 36:53.111
conversation with her about what
we were going to do next.

36:53.144 --> 36:56.815
And I hope we can speak more
consistently about it, because

36:56.848 --> 36:59.818
on the day when you needed me is
the day when you called, instead

36:59.851 --> 37:03.121
of sounding board with me as we
were going.

37:03.154 --> 37:07.393
So that would just be a
preference moving forward.

37:07.426 --> 37:09.895
Jeff: Chrissy, that's two
strikes, Chris similar from Ali

37:09.928 --> 37:13.098
on the challenge, criticism from
roark, yeah, you're my friend

37:13.131 --> 37:13.799
now.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.100
She didn't talk to me either.

37:15.133 --> 37:17.403
This is a two-way street here a
little bit.

37:17.436 --> 37:20.272
I specifically talked to Ali,
Ryan came to me.

37:20.306 --> 37:21.473
I was talking to j.P.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.042
We were all talking to each
other, so I don't know why this

37:24.075 --> 37:26.778
has to be a Chrissy has to
approach roark situation where

37:26.812 --> 37:30.382
she could have come to me, as
well.

37:30.416 --> 37:33.685
She just said she
specifically talked to Ali.

37:33.719 --> 37:38.524
She never specifically talked to
me.

37:38.557 --> 37:44.029
I have no comment.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.564
Jeff: Ryan, what did you
see?

37:45.597 --> 37:48.400
Chrissy took roark down to
the beach.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.502
I had no idea what they were
talking about.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.704
You start running everything
through your head because it

37:52.738 --> 37:54.139
only takes three tonight.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.374
J.P. What was your take?

37:55.407 --> 37:59.645
All of a sudden two girls
walk away, you start running

37:59.678 --> 38:01.580
those scenarios through your
head.

38:01.613 --> 38:04.249
There's two guys and three girl,
so that could be another way to

38:04.282 --> 38:07.753
go with it, and that makes me
uneasy sitting here.

38:07.786 --> 38:11.289
Jeff: So Chrissy, if it's
true that maybe these original

38:11.323 --> 38:16.395
lines are blurred, are you more,
less, or the same in terms of

38:16.428 --> 38:18.163
uncomfortable about the vote
tonight?

38:18.196 --> 38:19.431
I don't know.

38:19.465 --> 38:22.468
I mean, I think I came here
tonight expecting that it could

38:22.501 --> 38:23.802
be me tonight.

38:23.835 --> 38:27.839
So hearing all of this from all
of them, it's surprising and

38:27.873 --> 38:28.574
it's not surprising.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.575
I don't know.

38:29.608 --> 38:32.077
I mean, I'm not going to beat
myself up over it.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.745
I'm doing the best I can.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.814
Jeff: Roark, how about for
you?

38:35.847 --> 38:39.250
Are you now more comfortable or
less comfortable since she sat

38:39.284 --> 38:40.018
down?

38:40.051 --> 38:43.221
Can I feel the same
comfortable?

38:43.254 --> 38:43.922
Jeff: Yeah.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.824
I feel the same comfortable.

38:45.857 --> 38:48.293
I've made bonds I believe in
that I can vote based upon.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.896
Jeff: So Ali, that sounds
like somebody who believes they

38:50.929 --> 38:53.865
have bonded with at least two
people.

38:53.899 --> 38:56.968
I think that you can't really
ever earn trust until you get

38:57.002 --> 38:58.169
here.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.372
Roark had a great tribe with the
healers, but did they really

39:00.406 --> 39:05.477
know and understand the trust
that say me and Ryan know

39:05.511 --> 39:08.046
because we voted together or
Chrissy and j.P. Know because

39:08.079 --> 39:09.280
they vote together?

39:09.314 --> 39:11.983
Once we get here, that's when
you find out who you can trust.

39:12.017 --> 39:15.320
Jeff: So roark, two
hustler, two healers, you in the

39:15.353 --> 39:16.254
middle.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.990
Are you the swing, or are you
the easy vote?

39:19.024 --> 39:22.127
I think tonight I'm the
swing.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.996
Nothing I heard tonight has
changed my vote for what I think

39:25.030 --> 39:28.033
will make us a stronger tribe
moving forward.

39:28.066 --> 39:30.769
Jeff: Chrissy, if this is
true, one of the twosomes is

39:30.802 --> 39:31.937
about to be broken up.

39:31.970 --> 39:35.373
I don't see it as a two, a
one and a two at this point.

39:35.407 --> 39:38.444
I think the relationships have
formed over the last five days

39:38.477 --> 39:43.582
that it could be any three
people.

39:43.615 --> 39:44.382
Jeff: All right.

39:44.416 --> 39:45.717
Let's find out where the three
goes.

39:45.751 --> 39:46.818
Time to vote.

39:46.852 --> 39:52.390
Roark, you're up.

39:52.424 --> 40:02.233
Next time don't come for me.

40:02.267 --> 40:12.310
I'm outsmarting miss smarty
pants.

40:12.310 --> 40:23.221
I'm outsmarting miss smarty
pants.

40:23.254 --> 40:31.497
Jeff: I'll go tally the
votes.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.865
If anybody has a hidden immunity
idol and you want the play it,

40:33.899 --> 40:40.071
now would be the time to do so.

40:40.105 --> 40:41.039
Okay.

40:41.072 --> 40:42.474
Once the votes are read, the
decision is final.

40:42.508 --> 40:44.843
The person voted out will be
asked to leave the tribal

40:44.876 --> 40:46.044
council area immediately.

40:46.077 --> 40:50.582
I'll read the votes.

40:50.616 --> 40:55.521
First vote Chrissy.

40:55.554 --> 41:00.458
Roark.

41:00.492 --> 41:01.126
Chrissy.

41:01.159 --> 41:07.065
Two votes Chrissy.

41:07.098 --> 41:07.633
Roark.

41:07.666 --> 41:08.667
We're tied.

41:08.700 --> 41:14.940
Two votes roark, two votes
Chrissy, one vote left.

41:14.973 --> 41:20.311
Fifth person voted out of
"survivor: Heroes v. Healers v.

41:20.345 --> 41:22.948
Hustlers", roark.

41:22.981 --> 41:34.793
You need to bring me your torch.

41:34.826 --> 41:37.529
Roark, the tribe has spoken.

41:37.563 --> 41:39.497
Good luck, guys.

41:39.531 --> 41:48.173
Jeff: It's time for you to
go.

41:48.206 --> 41:50.642
Well, the stated goal of
tonight's tribal was a stronger

41:50.676 --> 41:54.212
tribe, but with a divided vote,
clearly the first step will be

41:54.245 --> 41:55.847
repair.

41:55.881 --> 41:56.715
Good luck with that.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.216
Grab your torches and head back
to camp.

41:58.249 --> 42:00.451
Good night.

42:00.919 --> 42:02.954
Captioning funded by CBS
and Ford.

42:02.988 --> 42:04.590
We go further, so you can.

42:05.023 --> 42:16.602
Captioned by
media access group at wgbh

42:16.635 --> 42:21.039
Jeff: Text time on
"survivor," texs are high.

42:21.072 --> 42:21.973
Why didn't you tell me?

42:22.007 --> 42:23.374
You just wrote Chrissy's name
down.

42:23.408 --> 42:25.577
Because that's what I thought
you wanted.

42:25.611 --> 42:28.346
I said I wasn't going to cry,
but it's rough.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.148
Jeff: And it all comes
crashing down.

42:30.181 --> 42:32.050
Oh, my god.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.051
Cole, are you okay?

42:33.084 --> 42:36.021
I'm not ready the play this
game without Cole.

42:36.054 --> 42:37.522
It was a great experience.

42:37.555 --> 42:40.759
I would tell any super fan to do
it, but I'm bummed.

42:40.792 --> 42:44.295
I felt like I had a lot more in
me, and I suppose I trusted the

42:44.329 --> 42:45.463
wrong people.

42:45.496 --> 42:48.133
The problem is it was my first
tribal, so I can't tell who

42:48.166 --> 42:51.469
voted with me.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.972
