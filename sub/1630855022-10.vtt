01:51.445 --> 01:54.740
So, Dad, is that like a new puffin thing?
You gonna get Mom one of those every year?

01:55.324 --> 01:57.242
Do you know how long
it took him to win me this?

01:57.242 --> 01:59.536
The kid said my form was excellent.

01:59.536 --> 02:00.996
Sorry, what's the puffin thing?

02:00.996 --> 02:05.083
Okay. It was a cool October night
23 years ago,

02:05.083 --> 02:08.711
and a young Miss Cassandra Hubbard
was on her very first date

02:08.711 --> 02:11.798
with the one such Dustard John Hubbard--

02:11.798 --> 02:13.509
Wait, your name is Dustard Hubbard?

02:13.509 --> 02:14.927
Mr. Hubbard's fine.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.095
And Dustard wanted
to play the Bust-a-Balloon

02:17.095 --> 02:19.431
because he wanted
to win a stuffed puffin because...

02:19.431 --> 02:20.682
Well, 'cause Cass said it was cute.

02:20.682 --> 02:24.353
Yes, and so he stepped right up.
And he threw dart after dart,

02:24.353 --> 02:26.480
and he failed to puncture
even a single balloon.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.148
Those games are basically rigged.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.692
However, my dad returned later that night

02:30.692 --> 02:33.028
and paid off the kid who was working
at the Bust-a-Balloon

02:33.028 --> 02:34.905
for every single puffin he had,

02:34.905 --> 02:37.950
so that he could give one to my mom
every single year for her birthday.

02:37.950 --> 02:40.702
And that's how sure he was
that they'd be together forever.

02:40.702 --> 02:44.164
That is so sweet.
But you left out the best part, Trina.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.875
I was operating the Ferris wheel
that night,

02:46.875 --> 02:50.504
and your dad paid me 20 bucks
to stop it at the top

02:50.504 --> 02:52.714
so he could get a little extra time
with your mom.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.842
So just, like, a light kidnapping?

02:54.842 --> 02:56.426
That's what it sounds like.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.262
At the time it was known as romance.

02:58.262 --> 03:00.639
I had totally forgotten
that was you that I paid off.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.809
Well, guess I don't leave
much of an impression.

03:05.853 --> 03:08.397
Hey, you kids wanna try
the mechanical bull?

03:08.397 --> 03:10.107
Looks like there isn't a big line
right now.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.775
Do you wanna try it again?

03:11.775 --> 03:17.239
No. Man. I mean,
I could go again just to mess with people.

03:17.239 --> 03:19.700
How's that messing with people?

03:19.700 --> 03:23.537
Just because, you know, everyone thinks
I'm so obsessed with this cowboy shit,

03:23.537 --> 03:25.080
I could lean into it.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.375
- As a goof. Yeah.
- Hey, well, I'll go with you, Mr. Kovac.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.335
- All right, partner.
- Howdy.

03:30.335 --> 03:31.545
- Let's do it.
- Giddyap.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.589
- Yeehaw.
- Let's go goof 'em.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.426
Have a good one, old buddy.

03:39.261 --> 03:42.097
I cannot remember a single thing
about that guy from high school.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.265
Apart from the time

03:43.265 --> 03:44.892
that he barfed at the botanical gardens.

03:44.892 --> 03:47.352
You know,
I remember that story very differently.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.938
- Why? Where do you think he barfed?
- No, the puffin story.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.649
I never actually said
that I thought puffins were cute.

03:52.649 --> 03:54.234
I think you did, Cass.

03:54.234 --> 03:58.739
No, you said, "Aren't these puffins cute?"
And I said, "Yes."

03:58.739 --> 04:00.991
Because, you know,
I wanted you to like me.

04:07.581 --> 04:12.169
Well, there was really no need to do that.
I liked you from the start.

04:16.130 --> 04:20.761
Yeah. Keep stirring, boys.
I don't want my noodles congealing.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.598
Remember, it's <i>mi famiglia</i>,
not <i>mi "congealia."</i>

04:24.598 --> 04:28.894
- Giorgio! How's it going?
- Hey, what's up, Nat?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.855
It's going pretty great, thanks.
Yeah, it's no biggie.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.190
I'm just kinda worried about the storm.

04:33.190 --> 04:35.817
You know? I'm trying to make
this pasta pit for the kids.

04:35.817 --> 04:39.238
And the spaghetti gets very heavy
when it's wet,

04:39.238 --> 04:41.406
and I don't wanna crush a child to death.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.284
- Yeah.
- You know? How you guys doing?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.453
We're fabulous.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.623
You remember my daughter Savannah,
from my ex-husband Mike?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.584
Of course. I've actually been meaning
to talk to you, Savannah.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.669
Why?

04:53.669 --> 04:55.587
Well, at the gala, I heard you saying

04:55.587 --> 04:58.340
that you didn't wanna go to France
just because you got "French."

04:58.340 --> 05:00.843
And I want you to listen to me, okay?

05:00.843 --> 05:04.388
France could screw off. Okay?

05:04.388 --> 05:05.931
I apologize for the salty language.

05:05.931 --> 05:08.350
But as a man who was pressurized
as a little boy

05:08.350 --> 05:10.018
to become a superstar hockey player,

05:10.018 --> 05:16.692
I as Giorgio would like to know
what you as Savannah would like to do.

05:17.860 --> 05:19.736
Well, I've actually
been getting into chess.

05:19.736 --> 05:21.947
Chess! Yes, I love it.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.574
Rooks and bishops
and following your heart.

05:23.574 --> 05:27.119
That, Savannah, is the stuff
that superstars are made of.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.748
Well, there you have it,
from one superstar to another.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.334
Giorgio.

05:34.334 --> 05:38.839
I just wanted to say that I heard
that Cass spurned your advances,

05:38.839 --> 05:41.216
and for what it's worth,

05:42.050 --> 05:46.096
she is probably the only woman
in the whole world

05:46.096 --> 05:47.472
who would say no to you.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.726
Maybe the only woman
in the history of civilization.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.145
If you wanna go back that far.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.273
- I'm gonna go somewhere else, Mom.
- Okay, call me.

05:56.773 --> 06:01.778
Sorry, Savannah still gets uncomfortable
when I flirt with handsome men

06:01.778 --> 06:04.031
who aren't her father in front of her.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.700
I guess she doesn't really want a stepdad.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.952
Whatever happened with you and Mikey?

06:10.078 --> 06:11.246
He was kind of a jerk.

06:12.289 --> 06:17.419
He was also very hairy,
and I'm just not into that.

06:17.419 --> 06:22.049
You know, I like to see a man's skin,

06:22.049 --> 06:26.136
like even skull skin.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.682
A bald man is very sexy to me.

06:33.185 --> 06:36.688
Well, that is a very interesting
perspective that you have there, Natalie.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.774
I am sure you're gonna make

06:38.774 --> 06:43.987
a lucky bald man very happy one day.

06:45.614 --> 06:48.742
- We'll see. Bye.
- Bye.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.001
Okay, just to warn you,

06:58.001 --> 07:00.003
- I am exceptionally good at this.
- Okay.

07:00.003 --> 07:02.631
Like, I practice on the bottles
at Johnson's all the time.

07:04.174 --> 07:07.261
- Yes! Did you see that? You saw that.
- You actually got that. Yeah, totally!

07:14.643 --> 07:15.686
Well, now I feel bad.

07:15.686 --> 07:18.564
No, we've had
enough feeling bad, and-- Thank you.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.984
And look, you can't feel bad
because now you have this.

07:21.984 --> 07:23.277
Sick. So how does this work?

07:23.277 --> 07:26.113
I just come back here later and buy
enough of these for, like, 30 years?

07:26.113 --> 07:28.323
Yeah, because you know
what I'm looking for in a guy?

07:28.323 --> 07:30.117
Someone who's exactly like my dad.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.286
I thought you were looking
for someone like my brother?

07:32.286 --> 07:35.581
Oh, shit.
Okay, so we're joking about that already?

07:35.581 --> 07:36.874
Jokes are for always.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.502
Okay, but seriously, like,
no offense to my parents,

07:41.003 --> 07:43.005
but if I'm still with someone
who I met in high school,

07:43.005 --> 07:44.631
like, 30 years from now,

07:44.631 --> 07:47.509
I will literally throw myself
right off a cliff.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.972
So you won't be with me then?

07:55.350 --> 07:57.227
Like, 30 years from now?

07:58.604 --> 08:01.940
I don't know.
Do you plan on being with me in 30 years?

08:01.940 --> 08:04.484
Like, this is our first real date, so...

08:04.484 --> 08:06.945
I know. It's just kind of
an intense thing to say on a first date.

08:06.945 --> 08:09.781
Like, you know definitively that
you don't wanna be with me.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.577
It's not definitive. Nothing's definitive.

08:13.577 --> 08:19.291
But yeah, I'm, like, pretty sure
I don't wanna be with only one person

08:19.291 --> 08:22.044
- for the rest of my life.
- Yeah. I totally get that.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.630
It's just funny that
after everything we've been through,

08:26.048 --> 08:27.966
to put that out there
right out of the gate,

08:27.966 --> 08:29.927
to know
that you're already breaking up with me,

08:29.927 --> 08:31.803
it's like,
"Great. This doesn't feel pointless."

08:34.347 --> 08:35.599
So--

08:35.599 --> 08:38.809
So something's pointless
because it ends one day?

08:59.414 --> 09:00.249
- What?
- I'm sorry.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.168
Do you mind if we just take it slow?

09:05.045 --> 09:08.173
Hana, this is already the most action
I've had in years.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.760
- We can take it as slow as you want.
- Okay, perfect.

09:12.803 --> 09:14.680
Maybe next time we do this at my place?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.933
Okay, sir,
you let yourself into my bedroom.

09:18.517 --> 09:19.977
I didn't know it was your bedroom,

09:19.977 --> 09:21.061
okay?

09:21.061 --> 09:23.397
I just hope we can find the guys
who robbed you.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.440
Okay,
this is actually a lot of stuff for me.

09:25.941 --> 09:29.778
- Really? You don't want more stuff?
- No, I hate stuff.

09:29.778 --> 09:32.155
It's like a hangover
from boarding school days.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.367
They don't allow you
to have a lot of personal items, so...

09:35.367 --> 09:36.952
I didn't know you went to boarding school.

09:36.952 --> 09:40.080
Really? It's usually
the first thing that I tell people.

09:40.914 --> 09:45.169
'Cause I just love when people look at me
the way that you're looking at me now.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.712
What? Well, how am I looking at you?

09:47.296 --> 09:50.257
Like I'm some privileged
little rich bitch snob or something.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.342
I don't think you're privileged.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.596
Okay, there were
a few other words in there.

09:57.681 --> 10:02.436
Well, maybe being a boarding
school girl was just your arrow.

10:03.187 --> 10:04.438
What do you mean "arrow"?

10:05.772 --> 10:09.985
Well, the thing you needed to be told
about yourself to get to something else.

10:10.694 --> 10:13.280
That's what Dusty Hubbard
thinks the MORPHO's all about.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.616
You're listening to Dusty Hubbard now?

10:15.616 --> 10:18.202
I mean, look at me.

10:19.286 --> 10:24.666
Even if that "Priest" card I found
wasn't meant for me, it saved my life.

10:24.666 --> 10:26.585
It gave me a sense of purpose.

10:26.585 --> 10:30.631
It brought me out of myself
and allowed me to move on

10:30.631 --> 10:34.426
in a way
that some random potential never would.

10:34.927 --> 10:39.389
I was alone, and I had no one,
and that card brought me here.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.685
It led me...

10:46.063 --> 10:47.314
to you.

10:50.234 --> 10:51.235
Right.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.654
What?

10:56.198 --> 10:57.407
Nothing.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.578
- I don't know. It's just--
- What did I say?

11:01.578 --> 11:04.998
I don't really like the way you're,
like, rewriting your narrative here.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.834
What do you mean?

11:06.834 --> 11:09.044
You're, like, making me a part
of your sad story

11:09.044 --> 11:10.963
- and expecting me to pity you.
- No.

11:10.963 --> 11:13.757
And it's, like, you're talking to someone
who's actually alone

11:13.757 --> 11:15.008
and has always been alone.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.262
And you saying that you have no one
when it's just not true.

11:18.262 --> 11:19.888
You had friends. You had family.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.849
And even when you found
your card that night,

11:21.849 --> 11:23.642
your father-in-law was there
supporting you.

11:23.642 --> 11:24.726
So please, don't--

11:24.726 --> 11:26.812
- I never told you that.
- What?

11:28.272 --> 11:30.482
I never told you
I was with my father-in-law.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.570
Yes, you did. How else would I know that?

11:38.407 --> 11:40.784
Okay, well, this is so dumb.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.744
I mean, why are we fighting about this?

11:43.579 --> 11:46.373
I'm going to get a bucket because I--

11:46.373 --> 11:48.959
I actually don't really trust
that whole duct tape thing.

11:48.959 --> 11:50.919
And you and I are gonna get drunk,

11:50.919 --> 11:53.881
and we're gonna keep making out
like we're in middle school. Okay?

11:54.464 --> 11:55.549
Okay.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.227
All right. So, shall we get
a roll of 50 tickets or--

12:07.227 --> 12:08.312
That's probably too much?

12:08.312 --> 12:11.607
Hi. So how much for just one ride
on the Ferris wheel?

12:11.607 --> 12:13.317
- How much is that?
- Just get the 50,

12:13.317 --> 12:14.943
in case I wanna kidnap you again.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.905
I mean, why not? You can afford it.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.826
I'm sorry what? I can afford it?

12:23.619 --> 12:25.746
You know what,
I wasn't gonna say anything,

12:26.246 --> 12:29.875
but I went to your gala,
and $100 is a lot for most people.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.752
I mean, I guess not for "Royalty,"

12:31.752 --> 12:34.171
but I am making
eight dollars an hour right now.

12:34.171 --> 12:36.840
And if what your mom said is true,
and you're running a scam--

12:36.840 --> 12:38.509
Okay, hold on there now--

12:38.509 --> 12:40.177
- No. This is good.
- What?

12:40.177 --> 12:43.055
I'm actually--
I'm happy you said something.

12:43.055 --> 12:45.599
Now, is your potential "Detective"?

12:45.599 --> 12:48.101
No, it's "Tattoo Artist." I did Dusty's.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.728
And you did a wonderful job, Liz.

12:50.521 --> 12:53.649
Okay, 'cause it feels like
you have it all figured out.

12:53.649 --> 12:57.819
Yeah, 'cause my master plan
was to defraud this entire town

12:57.819 --> 12:59.655
out of a few thousand dollars,

12:59.655 --> 13:01.490
and then trick people
into thinking I was special

13:01.490 --> 13:05.369
by building a machine
that says that I'm royalty,

13:05.369 --> 13:08.247
which is a potential
both very fucking confusing--

13:08.247 --> 13:10.791
- And how did you put it, Dusty?
- Completely unattainable.

13:10.791 --> 13:11.959
Yeah, completely unattainable.

13:11.959 --> 13:15.420
And all I had to do
to get everyone to go along with it

13:15.420 --> 13:18.340
is to use
all of my computer engineering skills

13:18.340 --> 13:22.886
to somehow manipulate this machine
into giving you and only you

13:22.886 --> 13:26.348
a card that reads, "Tattoo Artist,"

13:26.348 --> 13:31.353
which I'm guessing is a lifelong dream
that you've never shared with anyone else?

13:31.979 --> 13:32.980
Yeah.

13:32.980 --> 13:35.065
Cass, maybe we should just get the tickets
and go?

13:35.649 --> 13:40.279
Okay. Attention! Attention, everyone!
It is I, the evil genius

13:40.988 --> 13:46.577
who figured out the secret hopes
and dreams of everyone in this town,

13:46.577 --> 13:48.078
and I used it against you.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.538
And why?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.624
To gain two dollars' worth of quarters

13:52.624 --> 13:55.836
and to sell some fucking sweatshirts,
of course. Duh!

13:55.836 --> 13:57.087
You guys should bow.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.923
- Cass!
- 'Cause I'm your queen. Yeah, I'm the--

13:59.923 --> 14:01.341
- What?
- Please don't do this here.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.552
- Not at Deerfest.
- Okay, yeah,

14:03.552 --> 14:06.930
because maybe we don't want witnesses
to what I'm about to do to you.

14:06.930 --> 14:09.641
No witnesses. Excuse us.
Royal court coming through!

14:09.641 --> 14:10.976
Good luck, honey.

14:10.976 --> 14:14.396
I'm just gonna give
the mechanical bull a try.

14:18.233 --> 14:21.028
Cass. Let's just get this over with.

14:21.528 --> 14:25.699
Just tell me what an awful human being
I am and how much I've wronged you

14:25.699 --> 14:28.535
and make yourself the victim,
like you always do.

14:33.332 --> 14:34.750
What in God's name is this?

14:34.750 --> 14:38.128
- It's a hug. It's called a hug.
- I don't need a hug.

14:38.128 --> 14:42.257
I know. You don't need a hug.
You don't need me.

14:42.257 --> 14:43.759
Oh, Cass, don't be so dramatic.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.469
I'm not being dramatic.

14:45.469 --> 14:49.848
I'm just letting you know
that you hurt me too many times.

14:49.848 --> 14:54.019
Oh, please. We've both said things.
That's what mothers and daughters do.

14:54.728 --> 14:58.065
You know good and well that
anything I say, I'm just protecting you.

15:00.234 --> 15:01.652
You can let me go now.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.408
Cass.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.038
Okay.

15:54.371 --> 15:55.372
You were there.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.376
The night I found my card in the gutter,
you were there.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.546
Why didn't you say something
when I met you here?

16:03.839 --> 16:05.424
I didn't remember you at first.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.303
I don't remember every drunk asshole
I kick out of a bar.

16:10.762 --> 16:12.097
And the collar was new.

16:17.352 --> 16:18.562
You were the bartender.

16:19.062 --> 16:20.564
And you were the asshole.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.902
Getting wasted and picking a fight
with anyone who looked at you.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.446
Hence the kicking out.

16:28.989 --> 16:31.825
Then your father-in-law,
he came over and apologized to me,

16:31.825 --> 16:36.205
and he said that you were just passing
through town and wouldn't be back.

16:37.164 --> 16:41.418
That you had just spread your wife's ashes
and you weren't yourself.

16:41.418 --> 16:42.794
His daughter.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.256
- What?
- It was his daughter too.

16:46.757 --> 16:47.758
Yeah. So, I mean,

16:47.758 --> 16:51.053
didn't really feel like something
I should just bring up, you know?

16:51.053 --> 16:54.515
Like, "Hey, small world, but I was there
on the worst night of your life."

16:54.515 --> 16:57.267
- But you were working there.
- So?

16:57.267 --> 17:00.312
So I was just passing through,
but you were working there,

17:01.355 --> 17:04.107
which means you were in another town
where the MORPHO existed.

17:05.108 --> 17:06.484
And you never brought it up.

17:06.484 --> 17:09.238
So all this talk about,
"I don't need that thing,"

17:09.238 --> 17:12.156
or "a couple of months from now,
no one's gonna be talking about this--"

17:12.156 --> 17:14.660
Okay, well, you never told anyone
about your card.

17:14.660 --> 17:15.993
You kept that to yourself.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.663
I had my reasons.

17:17.663 --> 17:19.289
Yeah, well, I have my reasons too.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.919
It's like-- I'm a person, you know?

17:25.628 --> 17:29.341
It's like you wanna believe
that this card, like, led you to me.

17:29.341 --> 17:31.844
And it's, like,
you don't even know me, dude.

17:31.844 --> 17:34.179
I don't think anyone here knows you, Hana.

17:41.478 --> 17:45.023
Look, I don't have any answers for you.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.236
You need to stop looking for signs.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.004
- Yes! I got it.
- Stop it.

18:07.004 --> 18:09.882
- No. You're so small.
- I'm not-- Whatever.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.134
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

18:15.721 --> 18:17.139
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:17.806 --> 18:21.101
What happened in there?
Did you murder your mother?

18:21.685 --> 18:23.270
I think I've got a shovel in the car.

18:23.854 --> 18:25.856
I just gave her a hug.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.902
Wow. That is badass.

18:33.363 --> 18:37.701
- Do you even wanna go on the Ferris wheel?
- Yes. Yes, let's do it.

18:38.327 --> 18:41.205
You know, you don't have to say yes
just because I wanna do it.

18:41.705 --> 18:45.083
It's cold. It might rain.
Our bums might get wet.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.169
I don't know. I think we'll survive.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.974
Hey. How the hell do you get out of here?
I'm going in circles.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.226
Isn't that the point?

19:04.061 --> 19:06.563
Useless. Useless generation.

19:09.983 --> 19:12.569
- Hello?
- <i>Is this Isabelle Fontaine?</i>

19:12.569 --> 19:14.863
This is Mayor Fontaine. Who's this?

19:14.863 --> 19:17.324
<i>This is Dr. Woods.
Am I catching you at a bad time?</i>

19:17.324 --> 19:19.451
I don't even know
how to answer that question.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.577
What do you want?

19:20.577 --> 19:22.621
<i>I'm here with Mr. Johnson--
Walter Johnson,</i>

19:22.621 --> 19:24.373
<i>and he's had a cardiac event.</i>

19:25.207 --> 19:27.417
What is a cardiac event?
What does that mean?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.586
<i>He had a heart attack.</i>

19:31.839 --> 19:33.090
Well, is he okay?

19:33.090 --> 19:36.510
<i>He is. He's a little confused,
but I spoke with him a few minutes ago.</i>

19:38.136 --> 19:39.388
Well, why are you telling me this?

19:39.388 --> 19:42.516
Are you just calling everybody in town
and telling them the news?

19:42.516 --> 19:43.809
<i>No. I'm so sorry.</i>

19:43.809 --> 19:45.978
<i>It's been hard
to get clear communication with him,</i>

19:45.978 --> 19:47.563
<i>but I thought you might be his wife.</i>

19:47.563 --> 19:51.358
You thought I might be his wife?
Honey, I'm gay.

19:51.358 --> 19:53.193
What on earth would make you think that?

19:53.193 --> 19:56.196
<i>Well, he has you listed
as his emergency contact.</i>

19:56.196 --> 19:58.782
<i>That's how I got your number.</i>

20:00.951 --> 20:02.369
He doesn't have anyone else?

20:03.287 --> 20:04.454
<i>I guess not.</i>

20:18.594 --> 20:20.012
<i>Are you still there?</i>

20:26.476 --> 20:27.561
Can I speak to him?

20:28.353 --> 20:29.771
<i>He's resting right now.</i>

20:31.565 --> 20:35.736
Where is he? Where--
He's in w-- He's in the hospital?

20:37.112 --> 20:38.572
<i>Yes,
but he's just been admitted, so--</i>

20:38.572 --> 20:39.907
Tell him I'm coming.

20:40.991 --> 20:41.992
<i>Okay.</i>

21:03.138 --> 21:04.431
Oh, shit!

21:14.566 --> 21:16.944
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

21:34.044 --> 21:36.338
Shit, kid. What was that?

21:37.881 --> 21:39.550
Dusty, did you do that?

21:39.550 --> 21:42.678
Did I turn off the power
in the whole town,

21:42.678 --> 21:46.181
so I could get a few minutes alone
with my wife on the top of a Ferris wheel?

21:46.181 --> 21:48.308
No. Wish I'd thought of it though.

21:48.308 --> 21:51.854
Okay. Are we good up here?

21:51.854 --> 21:53.856
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine. We're fine.

21:53.856 --> 21:57.901
I mean, we're just sitting
in a metal box suspended in the sky

21:57.901 --> 22:01.488
in the middle of a potential
lightning storm.

22:01.488 --> 22:02.573
- Hello?
- Hon.

22:04.533 --> 22:07.119
- Okay.
- That wasn't ideal, was it? Okay.

22:07.119 --> 22:09.538
- Dusty, be careful.
- I'm all right. Hey. Is--

22:09.538 --> 22:12.791
Can anybody move this thing?
Is there a lever or something?

22:13.500 --> 22:14.626
Hey, Dusty.

22:15.210 --> 22:16.211
Hello, you.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.214
- Who is that?
- Nobody.

22:19.214 --> 22:20.924
Just a friend.

22:20.924 --> 22:24.178
Did the power go out? We were having sex.

22:24.178 --> 22:26.013
In a moving Ferris wheel?

22:26.013 --> 22:27.639
Jesus Christ, Hawaii.

22:28.140 --> 22:30.142
Can somebody help us, please?

22:30.142 --> 22:32.102
Dusty, is that you?

22:32.102 --> 22:33.353
Giorgio.

22:33.353 --> 22:37.316
- Oh, D, I'm gonna climb up there!
- Giorgio, no! It's too dangerous!

22:37.316 --> 22:39.151
D, I'm coming for you right now.

22:39.151 --> 22:41.653
I just gotta find--
I gotta find something tall.

22:42.154 --> 22:44.615
- You could use my bucket truck.
- Okay, thank you, sir.

22:44.615 --> 22:47.117
But I don't think
a truck full of buckets is gonna help.

22:47.117 --> 22:48.952
No, I work for the power company,

22:48.952 --> 22:51.830
and my truck--
It has a bucket. It's a crane.

22:51.830 --> 22:53.582
Like a cherry picker.

22:54.082 --> 22:56.126
Bro, are you gonna tell me
you have a cherry picker?

22:56.126 --> 22:57.878
- I call that a cherry picker.
- Cherry picker.

22:57.878 --> 22:59.713
Here, take my keys.

23:02.174 --> 23:05.886
Okay. Well, that was a bad throw, dawg.
That was a bad throw. Plus, it's dark.

23:05.886 --> 23:08.180
- Or else I never would have missed.
- Giorgio, can you just go?

23:08.180 --> 23:09.848
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

23:16.522 --> 23:19.858
- You okay?
- I just hope Trina's okay.

23:20.359 --> 23:22.861
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
I saw her with Jacob earlier.

23:22.861 --> 23:26.281
God, she looked so happy. They both did.
And they look so fucking young.

23:26.281 --> 23:27.741
- Oh my God.
- They're babies.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.661
I mean, literal sweet-faced,
baby-faced babies.

23:31.662 --> 23:33.664
I don't remember ever feeling that young.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.708
I mean not even when we were that young.

23:37.626 --> 23:40.087
Making choices
that would affect the rest of our lives.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.798
Yeah, well, we were.

23:48.554 --> 23:50.597
I don't know, Cass,

23:51.098 --> 23:54.810
what it means if our arrows
are pointing in different directions.

23:54.810 --> 23:55.894
I don't know.

23:55.894 --> 24:00.148
And if my potential has something to do
with the last time we were apart,

24:00.148 --> 24:01.233
maybe...

24:04.111 --> 24:08.907
maybe we should see what it feels like
being apart for a bit.

24:10.742 --> 24:14.830
I mean, maybe your potential
is only completely unattainable

24:14.830 --> 24:16.164
while you're with me.

24:17.958 --> 24:21.336
But doesn't it feel
like we're supposed to find out?

24:31.346 --> 24:33.348
Did you know that puffins are monogamous?

24:34.808 --> 24:36.852
Did you know that puffins were monogamous?

24:37.728 --> 24:39.563
Well, it was in some book that you gave me

24:39.563 --> 24:41.398
as, like, a stocking stuffer or something.

24:41.398 --> 24:44.318
And it said that the male puffin
and the female puffin

24:44.318 --> 24:47.821
will go on separate journeys
for about eight months out of the year.

24:48.363 --> 24:49.364
Just apart.

24:50.324 --> 24:54.286
But somehow, they always find their way
back to each other.

24:58.999 --> 25:00.459
But we're not puffins.

25:10.511 --> 25:12.679
- I'm not scared.
- Oh, yeah?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.264
At all. Yeah.

25:15.057 --> 25:19.728
'Cause this is wood.
And lightning hates wood, so...

25:20.687 --> 25:21.855
Also, now that the power's out,

25:21.855 --> 25:24.900
we can fully make out in public,
and no one can give us dirty looks.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.363
Or I can use this as an opportunity
to sneak off and leave you

25:29.363 --> 25:31.031
since we're gonna break up.

25:31.031 --> 25:33.992
Wow.
Okay, so we're joking about that now?

25:33.992 --> 25:35.911
Jokes are for always.

25:36.703 --> 25:41.250
Yeah. Well, this is already more moments
than I ever thought I'd get with you.

25:42.125 --> 25:45.838
So, I would say
it's a pretty big win for me.

25:45.838 --> 25:47.172
Overall.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.467
So when are we making out?

25:51.802 --> 25:53.053
Right now.

26:02.104 --> 26:03.313
Jacob!

26:06.024 --> 26:07.025
Trina!

26:08.068 --> 26:09.069
Jacob!

26:09.069 --> 26:11.738
Hello? Help me!

26:12.739 --> 26:15.868
- Who's that? Is there someone in there?
- It's Mayor Fontaine!

26:15.868 --> 26:17.244
Mayor Fontaine, are you all right?

26:17.244 --> 26:20.080
No! I can barely see my hands
in front of my damn face,

26:20.080 --> 26:23.208
and my darn knee is acting up again.

26:23.208 --> 26:24.877
Okay. Don't panic.

26:24.877 --> 26:26.587
- Who is this?
- It's Beau.

26:27.296 --> 26:28.422
Who is Beau?

26:31.341 --> 26:33.510
He's the guy
who's gonna get you out of there.

26:45.647 --> 26:46.940
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:46.940 --> 26:50.652
Okay, I'm gonna take D first
'cause he seems more scared.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.905
I am not more scared.

26:53.906 --> 26:55.616
Just take Cass. Take Cass.

26:55.616 --> 26:58.577
- Okay, Cassie. I got you. I got you, Cass.
- Okay.

26:58.577 --> 27:00.454
- I've got you.
- Keep steady.

27:00.454 --> 27:03.373
- We've both got you. There you go.
- That's nice, Cassie. Nice.

27:06.001 --> 27:07.628
- Dusty, you got me?
- I got you.

27:07.628 --> 27:09.213
- Yep. Okay, sweetheart.
- Okay.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.464
I'm bringing you down.

27:50.879 --> 27:55.175
Oh, my God, Giorgio!
That was amazing. We saved the town.

27:55.175 --> 27:58.971
Hey, Nat. You know how you said
that Savannah doesn't want a stepdad?

27:58.971 --> 27:59.930
Yeah.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.561
How about a step-Giorgio?

28:16.405 --> 28:18.156
- Izzy, are you still there?
- Yeah?

28:18.156 --> 28:20.033
Yes! What took you so long?

28:20.033 --> 28:22.536
I'm sorry. They made me leave this thing
at bag check.

28:22.536 --> 28:24.454
- What thing?
- This thing.

28:39.511 --> 28:40.762
Oh, my God.

28:43.223 --> 28:44.224
Thank you.

28:53.400 --> 28:54.651
You're safe now, Izzy.

28:58.989 --> 29:03.076
What are you doing? I can walk on my own.

29:03.702 --> 29:05.162
I'd prefer to carry you, ma'am.

29:06.580 --> 29:07.664
Come on then.

29:13.045 --> 29:14.546
It's starting to rain.

30:00.050 --> 30:04.555
Hey, where are you guys?
We're passing Dear Izzy.

30:05.722 --> 30:06.849
<i>Wait, I see you.</i>

30:06.849 --> 30:09.726
- I don't see you guys.
- Mom! Dad!

30:09.726 --> 30:11.478
There she is. There she-- Hey!

30:12.062 --> 30:12.896
- You all right?
- Yeah.

30:12.896 --> 30:13.981
Yeah?

30:13.981 --> 30:15.357
What happened to Beau?

30:15.357 --> 30:18.735
I don't know. We got separated.
Are you guys okay?

30:20.320 --> 30:21.947
- Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.
- Yeah.

30:21.947 --> 30:23.282
We nearly got electrocuted,

30:23.282 --> 30:24.950
- but we're fine.
- Yeah.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.034
What's that?

31:36.480 --> 31:37.814
What does it say?

31:41.860 --> 31:44.029
"Are you ready for the next stage?"

32:02.840 --> 32:04.466
It's never done that before.
