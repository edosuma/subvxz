why you're having such

About your new beau?

11:34.920 --> 11:35.880
About you.

11:35.880 --> 11:37.880
Your excommunication.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.790
I told you, Isabelle.
I'm OK.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.170
Why don't I believe you?

11:48.250 --> 11:50.250
Mama, we said no more secrets.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.880
Remember?

11:51.880 --> 11:53.880
You don't have
to hide how you feel.

11:56.670 --> 11:58.670
I feel so lost.

As a family.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.330
All right.

13:16.330 --> 13:17.330
I'll go.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.580
If I get to meet him.

13:19.580 --> 13:21.540

Anyone who makes you
smile like that...

13:28.040 --> 13:30.000
...must be someone special.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.830
Bring him tonight.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.710
So this Owl is just a puppet,

13:37.710 --> 13:40.880
possessing mundanes on behalf
of some super scary demon?

13:40.880 --> 13:41.830
Something like that.

All of the Owl's targets

13:44.670 --> 13:47.540

after killing their loved ones.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.000
If we can find even one of them,

13:49.000 --> 13:50.620
they might lead us to the Owl.

17:45.380 --> 17:47.460
You know, when we

17:49.040 --> 17:52.330

19:06.290 --> 19:08.120
OK.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.500

a better look at it.

in my day, but...

19:27.120 --> 19:28.960
never this.

19:31.580 --> 19:33.080
The last thing I remember,

19:33.080 --> 19:35.580
it touched its claw to my chest.

19:37.620 --> 19:40.210
I still don't know
why it didn't kill me.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.250
Powerful demons
often leave an imprint,

19:42.250 --> 19:44.330
traces of their unique energy.

19:44.330 --> 19:47.380
If I can tap into the spot
where it made contact with you,

19:47.380 --> 19:48.580
perhaps we can get
a better sense

19:48.580 --> 19:49.830
of what we're dealing with.

20:03.210 --> 20:04.420
What is it?

20:04.420 --> 20:06.670
This energy signature, it's...

20:06.670 --> 20:09.170
the same as the one
that corrupted the ley lines.

20:09.170 --> 20:12.420
It seems that we're
chasing the same demon.

20:21.420 --> 20:22.380
Wha...

20:22.380 --> 20:23.290
What are you doing?

20:23.290 --> 20:25.420

to an old contact.

20:25.420 --> 20:28.330

far beyond my resources.

20:28.330 --> 20:30.040
Hopefully, he's willing
to help us...

20:30.040 --> 20:31.460
identify the beast.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.500
I should tell Jace.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.880
Biscuit?

20:38.880 --> 20:40.420
Is everything OK?

20:40.420 --> 20:43.040
I tried to tell Jace
about all of this earlier,

20:43.040 --> 20:46.880
but he was acting... strange.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.290
Strange how?

20:49.540 --> 20:50.960
Maybe I'm being paranoid,

20:50.960 --> 20:55.040
but he didn't exactly
seem happy to see me.

20:56.330 --> 20:59.040
I tried to hug him
and it just, it felt... odd.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.830
Relationships...

21:00.830 --> 21:03.710
They can be exasperating,
can't they?

21:03.710 --> 21:05.710
Yeah.

21:05.710 --> 21:08.790
Sometimes, it's best...
just to be patient.

21:08.790 --> 21:10.830
Jace has been through a lot.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.830
He probably just
needs some time.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.380
Ah. We're in luck.

21:19.380 --> 21:21.670
Brother Zachariah says
he's willing to meet.

21:21.670 --> 21:23.540

21:26.380 --> 21:27.920

21:27.920 --> 21:29.290

21:29.290 --> 21:31.420

to leave the apartment.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.080
And find somewhere we can
lay low 'til he gets back.

21:33.080 --> 21:35.420
No, I can't. You know
I have work tonight.

21:35.420 --> 21:37.460
Can't you get
your shift covered?

21:37.460 --> 21:38.880
No.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.580
And you can tell
that Praetor of yours

21:40.580 --> 21:42.460
I'm not going into hiding
just ¢cause some vamp chick

21:42.460 --> 21:43.460
can't take a hint.

21:43.460 --> 21:45.380
You didn't...

21:45.380 --> 21:47.040
You didn't see
the look on her face.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.420
When I was at her place, I...

21:49.880 --> 21:51.460
I smelled fresh blood.

21:51.460 --> 21:52.500
A lot of it.

21:52.500 --> 21:54.500
You think she killed a mundane?

21:54.500 --> 21:56.290
I don't know. But...

21:56.290 --> 21:58.040
I was stupid enough to tell her
I have a girlfriend.

21:58.040 --> 21:59.500
What if she comes after you?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.290
Let her.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.210
She'll be sorry she did.

22:09.500 --> 22:11.790
MARYSE: The fact that you
had the courage to get help...

22:11.790 --> 22:13.750
I am so proud of you.

22:13.750 --> 22:16.500
I'm just glad
I'm back to normal.

22:16.500 --> 22:19.170
Yeah. How about we
order some food?

22:19.170 --> 22:21.120
That is a great idea.
I'm starving.

22:35.580 --> 22:37.170
I hope I'm not embarrassing you.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.540
What are you talking about?

22:39.540 --> 22:41.620
You're our mother.
We stand by you.

22:41.620 --> 22:42.750
Always.

22:44.380 --> 22:45.540
Thank you.

22:45.540 --> 22:48.000
If there is a silver lining
in all of this,

22:48.000 --> 22:50.080
it's getting to be
with the three of you again.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.210

gonna do now?

22:54.210 --> 22:57.420

22:57.420 --> 22:59.380

22:59.380 --> 23:01.500

he's not here yet.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.880

23:02.880 --> 23:04.460

23:07.460 --> 23:08.620

23:08.620 --> 23:09.790
What friend?

23:09.790 --> 23:11.670
Friend? Wait, you have
a new boyfriend?

23:11.670 --> 23:13.250
Why am I the last one
to hear about this?

23:13.250 --> 23:15.000
Oh, no. Alec, I haven't
heard about this one either.

23:16.000 --> 23:18.710
OK. He's not my boyfriend.
We've only been on one date.

23:18.710 --> 23:20.080

Is he a werewolf?

A warlock?

23:23.080 --> 23:24.500
He's a mundane.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.540
Seriously?

23:25.540 --> 23:26.880
Well, that's new.

23:26.880 --> 23:28.960
I'm practically a mundane
at this point.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.580
You all have to promise

23:30.580 --> 23:31.580
to behave yourselves.

23:36.460 --> 23:38.670
MARYSE: Oh, Isabelle.
He is handsome.

23:38.670 --> 23:39.670
Mom...

23:46.120 --> 23:47.880
Can't wait to meet him.

23:53.210 --> 23:55.380
So what kind of doctor are you?

23:55.380 --> 23:56.500
Pediatric surgeon.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.170
You work with children.
Yeah, well,

23:58.170 --> 24:00.670
kids love to break their arms,
run into coffee tables.

24:00.670 --> 24:01.790
And...

24:01.790 --> 24:04.040
Not everybody heals
as fast as Isabelle.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.460
Yeah...

24:05.460 --> 24:07.540
The magic of makeup.

24:08.710 --> 24:11.250
Anyway, Isabelle has told me
about the family business.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.040
What exactly did she tell you?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.460
Is the jewelry thing a secret?

24:15.460 --> 24:18.420
Oh... jewelry. She told you
we're jewelers?

24:18.420 --> 24:22.210
We prefer to think
of ourselves as artists.

24:26.500 --> 24:27.710
What is it?

24:27.710 --> 24:29.710
Uh... nothing.

24:29.710 --> 24:32.420
I just need a refill. Excuse me.

24:38.420 --> 24:39.920
Can I get a refill?
Make it a double.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.080
Tough day at the office?

24:46.620 --> 24:47.790
You could say that.

24:50.460 --> 24:52.380
I don't usually...

24:52.380 --> 24:53.380
Oh, hey, hey.

24:53.380 --> 24:54.620
No judgement here.

24:54.620 --> 24:55.960
I mean...

24:55.960 --> 24:57.380
If anyone deserves a drink,

24:57.380 --> 24:59.000
it's gotta be the head
of the Institute, right?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.120
I can't even
begin to imagine

25:01.120 --> 25:03.080
the kind of stress
that would bring.

25:05.710 --> 25:07.170
Yeah.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.040
So, uh...

25:10.040 --> 25:11.170
Where's your better half?

25:12.620 --> 25:14.120
Busy.

25:14.120 --> 25:15.290
Oh.

25:15.290 --> 25:17.120
That's too bad.

25:17.120 --> 25:18.540
You know what? I'll just, uh...

25:18.540 --> 25:20.500
I'll leave you to you
and your drink.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.380
You have a... you have a good
rest of your night, OK?

25:25.330 --> 25:26.540
You too.

25:33.210 --> 25:34.790
At ease, soldier.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.790
Don't you want to say hi
to your friends?

25:36.790 --> 25:38.420
Heidi caught me off guard twice.

25:38.420 --> 25:39.880
I'm not letting
that happen again.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.750
Simon... I told you,

25:41.750 --> 25:43.120
I can handle it.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.120
I don't doubt that,

25:44.120 --> 25:45.830
but I'm not leaving your side.

25:45.830 --> 25:47.000
OK.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.790
Well, you should try blinking
every once in a while.

25:49.790 --> 25:51.420
You're starting
to freak people out.

25:52.790 --> 25:54.330
Thank you.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.960
Who's up for some dessert?

25:55.960 --> 25:57.500
Oh, I am!
Sure, yeah.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.670
Maryse Lightwood
at the Hunter's Moon.

25:59.670 --> 26:00.670
Lucian...

26:03.960 --> 26:05.580
We should get another round.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.670
Obviously, you heard
what happened.

26:14.670 --> 26:16.670
I did.

26:16.670 --> 26:18.830
I'm sorry.

26:18.830 --> 26:20.830
Poetic justice, isn't it?

26:20.830 --> 26:23.080
Considering how shamefully
I acted

26:23.080 --> 26:24.830
when you were excommunicated.

26:24.830 --> 26:26.750
I didn't come here to rub it in.

26:27.710 --> 26:30.920
Believe me, I know firsthand
how hard it is.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.170
Reaching for your stele,

26:33.170 --> 26:34.830
and realizing it's not there.

26:34.830 --> 26:36.250
I know it's daunting,

26:36.250 --> 26:37.710
but I promise,

26:37.710 --> 26:39.170
it's not all bad.

26:39.170 --> 26:41.250
And if you need help adjusting,

26:41.250 --> 26:43.920
I'm around.

26:45.710 --> 26:47.460
I appreciate that.

26:49.710 --> 26:51.830
It is a new beginning.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.830
A chance for me
to be a better person.

26:56.830 --> 26:57.880
There you go.

27:00.790 --> 27:02.080
What?

27:02.080 --> 27:03.830
Nothing. I just...

27:03.830 --> 27:05.500
What?

27:05.500 --> 27:07.420
I just haven't seen you
let your hair down,

27:07.420 --> 27:10.880
literally, since
the Accords Ball in Idris.

27:12.670 --> 27:15.120
That was 20 years ago.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.830
Was that 20 years ago?

27:16.830 --> 27:18.210
Yeah.

27:18.210 --> 27:20.750
Well, you look just as lovely
now as you did then.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.670
So... where is your friend?

27:26.670 --> 27:27.880
He should be here.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.750
Magnus...

27:33.750 --> 27:34.920
Are you OK?

27:36.080 --> 27:37.500
Yeah.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.620
I've been so focused
on my own problems

27:39.620 --> 27:41.330
but... I can tell

27:41.330 --> 27:43.540
something's going on.

27:43.540 --> 27:45.830
Alec and I had a fight.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.920
A bad one.

27:48.920 --> 27:51.790
We both said some things
we didn't actually mean.

27:52.790 --> 27:54.080
I'm sorry.

27:55.710 --> 27:58.210
But there's nothing
you two can't work out.

28:02.250 --> 28:03.830
I hope that's true.

28:07.960 --> 28:09.750
Magnus Bane...

28:13.580 --> 28:14.960
It has been too long.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.120
Indeed, it has.

28:17.120 --> 28:18.830
I'm sorry to call
on you like this.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.500
Clary...

28:20.500 --> 28:22.080
this is Brother Zachariah.

28:23.920 --> 28:24.960
You're a Silent Brother?

28:24.960 --> 28:27.920
I know I appear
unlike the others...

28:29.080 --> 28:30.750
But that is a tale
for another day.

28:32.920 --> 28:34.790
These texts
contain information

28:34.790 --> 28:36.750
on long forgotten demon forms.

28:36.750 --> 28:39.540
They may hold a clue
to your creature's identity.

28:39.540 --> 28:41.170
You understand,

28:41.170 --> 28:43.710
if the Brotherhood discovers
I helped you with this...

28:43.710 --> 28:45.710
No one will know
you were here today.

28:46.880 --> 28:48.420
Thank you for your assistance.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.580
Any friend of Will Herondale
is a friend of mine.

28:51.580 --> 28:52.710
Herondale?

28:53.920 --> 28:56.790
We both were close
with Jace's ancestor.

28:59.710 --> 29:01.250
I know I shouldn't ask this,

29:01.250 --> 29:04.420
but... did you help
with Jace's treatment?

29:04.420 --> 29:05.830
He's been...

29:05.830 --> 29:09.000
acting differently
since he got back.

29:09.000 --> 29:10.960
We received
his treatment request.

29:10.960 --> 29:13.210
I would have been
happy to oversee it.

29:13.210 --> 29:15.710
"Would have been"?
What do you mean?

29:17.170 --> 29:20.540
Jace Herondale never came
to the Silent City.

Stressed? No. No. I'm fine.

29:37.080 --> 29:39.000
I'm totally relaxed.
Wanna talk about it?

29:39.000 --> 29:41.080
Not really. But how are you?

29:41.080 --> 29:42.880
I heard about your mom.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.040
Must be tough.

You know, I wish there
was something more useful

29:46.080 --> 29:48.330
I can do...
being a Shadowhunter...

29:49.710 --> 29:51.420
...it meant everything to her.

29:53.080 --> 29:54.750
When my mom was going through

29:54.750 --> 29:56.960
her issues...

29:56.960 --> 29:58.170
I felt powerless too.

29:58.170 --> 30:00.000
But I realized that sometimes,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.170
a parent just needs to know
that you're there for them.

30:02.170 --> 30:04.210
And you are, 'cause you're
an awesome daughter.

30:10.380 --> 30:11.830

this is your fault

How about I help you
through the back?

31:21.080 --> 31:23.170
I'll hail you a cab.

You know this vampire?
Her name's Heidi.

32:30.080 --> 32:31.880
I'm her sire.

32:31.880 --> 32:33.210
It's a complicated story,

32:33.210 --> 32:34.920
but she's not in her right mind.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.080
Raphael tortured her.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.080
He thought because
she had my blood,

32:39.080 --> 32:40.460
she might be a Daylighter too.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.170
So...
Wait.

32:42.170 --> 32:44.540
You're the one
he experimented on?

32:44.540 --> 32:45.790
Yes.

32:45.790 --> 32:46.790
You knew about that?

32:46.790 --> 32:48.790
I'm the one who made
Raphael leave town.

32:52.500 --> 32:54.790
Attacked a blood truck,
killed a mundane.

32:54.790 --> 32:56.540
She even tried to kill me.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.380
She needs to be turned
in to the Clave.

32:58.380 --> 33:00.080
And the Clave will do what?
Execute her?

33:00.080 --> 33:03.000
Toss her into the Gard forever?
She doesn't deserve that.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.170
Look, everyone knows
how hard it is

33:05.170 --> 33:07.210
for fledglings
to control their urges,

33:07.210 --> 33:09.880
and she didn't have anyone
looking out for her.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.670
But now she does.

33:11.670 --> 33:13.210
So please, Isabelle?

33:13.210 --> 33:16.210

hurts anyone again.

33:31.040 --> 33:32.290
I'm good. You?

33:32.290 --> 33:34.040
Do you wanna step outside?

33:34.040 --> 33:35.120
Maybe grab some fresh air?

33:35.120 --> 33:37.290
No problem.

33:37.290 --> 33:38.880
Isabelle?

33:38.880 --> 33:40.670
Is that blood?

33:42.250 --> 33:43.580
Oh, this?

33:45.420 --> 33:47.540
You know, I tend
to get nosebleeds.

33:47.540 --> 33:50.040
It's... it's something
that kind of like, you know...

33:50.040 --> 33:52.710
I'm not stupid.
What's going on with you?

33:54.250 --> 33:56.210
Nothing. Really, I'm fine.

33:56.210 --> 33:58.210
Come on. Let's get dessert.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.670
There's usually cabs here.

34:10.170 --> 34:12.250
Magnus and I had
our first date here.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.960

we were too different

34:16.960 --> 34:18.670
to be together.

34:22.330 --> 34:24.380
We never really got around
to answering that question.

34:25.920 --> 34:27.380
And now...

34:29.170 --> 34:31.710
Now, it's come around
to bite me in the ass.

34:33.040 --> 34:34.290

Just...

Look...

34:45.500 --> 34:47.500
I may not know all the details,

34:47.500 --> 34:49.920
but I think I can
guess what you mean

34:49.920 --> 34:52.620
when you talk about
your "differences."

34:52.620 --> 34:55.330
Magnus isn't a Shadowhunter.

34:55.330 --> 34:57.170
He may not understand our ways.

34:59.290 --> 35:01.920
Nephilim love once, fiercely.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.790
Whatever you're feeling...

35:04.960 --> 35:06.670
...it's OK.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.250
Don't be so hard on yourself.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.380
Right.

35:15.210 --> 35:17.040
I gotta go.

35:17.040 --> 35:19.330
Oh, here. Let me get that.

35:19.330 --> 35:20.330
I got it.

Hang on. I'll be right back.

35:44.170 --> 35:45.250
OK.

35:45.250 --> 35:48.290
Sorry to pop up like this,

35:48.290 --> 35:49.790
but you weren't
answering your phone.

35:49.790 --> 35:51.380
What's going on? I thought
you were headed home.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.880
I am...

35:52.880 --> 35:55.380
but I wanted to let you
know I found a lead.

35:55.380 --> 35:58.460
Transit surveillance footage
of two of our Owl victims

35:58.460 --> 36:01.460
coming up from the subway
at 125th Street.

36:01.460 --> 36:02.670
125th...

36:02.670 --> 36:04.540
So you think they're gathering
somewhere up in Harlem?

36:04.540 --> 36:07.380
Could be. Well, it's
a start at least.

36:07.380 --> 36:08.830
Nice work.

36:08.830 --> 36:10.620
We'll check it out
first thing in the morning.

36:10.620 --> 36:12.580
It'll be safer to sniff around
during the daylight.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.290
Now get out of here.

36:14.290 --> 36:15.460
Go spend time
with your lady.

36:15.460 --> 36:17.380
You go back to yours.

36:28.250 --> 36:30.120
Simon...

36:30.120 --> 36:31.290
What you did back there?

36:31.290 --> 36:33.540
Choosing me...

36:33.540 --> 36:35.460
you won't regret it.

36:38.620 --> 36:40.330
I know that you don't love me.

36:41.540 --> 36:42.880
But, um...

36:42.880 --> 36:44.540
when you're ready,

36:44.540 --> 36:46.790
we'll start a clan of our own.

36:51.120 --> 36:53.080
I'm sorry.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.080
What?

36:54.080 --> 36:56.380
I'm sorry.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.170
Simon... what's going on?

37:00.170 --> 37:01.500
They're from the Praetor Lupus.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.580
It's an organization
that helps Downworlders.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.080
They're here to...

37:05.080 --> 37:07.080
help rehabilitate you.

37:07.080 --> 37:09.000
If you cooperate,
you won't be harmed.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.210
You son of a bitch.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.290
Hey.

37:27.290 --> 37:28.960
You did the right thing.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.210
Well, why doesn't
it feel like it?

37:38.750 --> 37:40.500
If he wasn't
in the City of Bones,

37:40.500 --> 37:41.620
then where the hell was he?

37:41.620 --> 37:43.290
I'm sure there's an explanation,

37:43.290 --> 37:44.500
maybe even a good one.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.500
We're supposed
to be in this together!

37:46.500 --> 37:48.790
You don't lie
to someone you love.

37:48.790 --> 37:50.330
Wait.

37:50.330 --> 37:51.750
You said Jace

37:51.750 --> 37:53.330
was acting cold
towards you earlier?

37:53.330 --> 37:54.710
Detached?

37:54.710 --> 37:56.500
As if he didn't have
any feelings for you anymore?

37:56.500 --> 37:58.710
I don't know... I guess.

37:58.710 --> 37:59.920
Around the time that Jace

37:59.920 --> 38:02.250
was preparing to go
to the Silent City,

38:02.250 --> 38:04.040
a woman came to see me.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.580
She requested an elixir
that would make

38:06.580 --> 38:08.210
a person fall out of love.

38:08.210 --> 38:10.540
There was something
off about her.

38:10.540 --> 38:14.000
I couldn't put my finger
on it right away, but...

38:14.000 --> 38:17.420
what if she was simply...
masking her power?

38:20.460 --> 38:22.420
What if she was the demon
that attacked you,

38:22.420 --> 38:24.380
disguised in human form?

38:24.380 --> 38:25.880
You really think
that's possible?

38:25.880 --> 38:28.120
To complete the potion,
a sliver of soul

38:28.120 --> 38:29.920
was required from
the object of affection.

38:29.920 --> 38:32.500
And you wondered why
that demon only touched you,

38:32.500 --> 38:34.670
instead of just... killing you.

38:34.670 --> 38:37.500
But why? Why would this woman
give this elixir to Jace?

38:38.620 --> 38:40.420
We need to find him.

38:46.080 --> 38:47.420
Hey, kiddo.

38:47.420 --> 38:49.080
Luke, you at Hunter's Moon?

38:49.080 --> 38:50.080
Yeah.

38:50.080 --> 38:51.120
Is Jace there?

38:51.120 --> 38:52.670
Yeah. He just left
a couple of minutes ago.

38:52.670 --> 38:55.080
Why

No!

39:45.170 --> 39:46.250
STOP!

I've got him.

40:18.670 --> 40:20.330
Oh, my God...

40:20.330 --> 40:22.380
Jace... it's you?

40:43.830 --> 40:45.580
It was him... all along.
