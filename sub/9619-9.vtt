00:28.486 --> 00:28.945
{\an1}ABOUT ANTS.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.196
{\an1}YOU SAID, "NO LIZARDS,

00:44.753 --> 00:45.587
{\an1}WANT ANTS?

00:45.670 --> 00:46.171
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HE WOULDN'T.

00:46.254 --> 00:50.175
{\an1}NO ONE IN THE RIGHT MIND WOULD.

00:50.258 --> 00:51.009
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I BET IT'S A BOXFUL OF MONEY

00:51.092 --> 00:53.553
{\an1}OR GOLD BARS.

00:53.636 --> 00:54.095
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW HOW HEAVY

00:54.179 --> 00:58.349
{\an1}GOLD BARS ARE?

00:58.433 --> 01:00.143
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT THAT HEAVY.

01:00.226 --> 01:01.603
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN YOU TAKE THIS

01:01.686 --> 01:03.188
{\an1}TO MR. MADIGAN'S OFFICE, PLEASE?

01:03.271 --> 01:04.105
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I GOT A BETTER PLAN.

01:04.188 --> 01:05.022
{\an1}SOMEONE ELSE DO IT.

01:05.105 --> 01:05.607
{\an1}I GOT A BELLYFUL OF CARROTS

01:05.690 --> 01:10.653
{\an1}AND I NEED TO NAP.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.698
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MR. MADIGAN,

01:13.782 --> 01:14.115
{\an1}THEY BROUGHT THIS

01:14.199 --> 01:14.616

01:14.699 --> 01:16.534
{\an1}BUT IT'S FOR YOU.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.411
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S EITHER ANTS OR MONEY.

01:18.495 --> 01:19.996

01:40.600 --> 01:42.101
{\an1}THESE SPECIAL GUESTS ARE DONUTS.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.187
{\an1}WAIT UNTIL THE MEETING.

{\an1}I'D WISH FOR A TALKING PONY

10:56.072 --> 10:57.990

{\an1}YOUR MATCHMAKING SKILLS ON MR. M

11:15.800 --> 11:18.928
{\an1}WHEN I AM STILL IN THE MARKET.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.179
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU DO NOT WANT A GIRLFRIEND.

11:20.262 --> 11:20.888
{\an1}ALL YOU CARE ABOUT

11:20.971 --> 11:21.889
{\an1}IS PLAYING VIDEO GAMES

11:21.972 --> 11:24.517
{\an1}AND NOT GETTING YELLED AT.

11:24.600 --> 11:25.017

11:25.101 --> 11:26.102
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YEAH.

11:34.443 --> 11:35.444
{\an1}DON'T EVER MENTION HER NAME

11:35.528 --> 11:36.737
{\an1}IN THIS OFFICE EVER AGAIN,

11:36.821 --> 11:38.197
{\an1}EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.703
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I WILL SAY THIS ONLY ONCE.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.415
{\an1}FIVE YEARS AGO, MAX MET SOPHIE

11:47.498 --> 11:47.957
{\an1}WHILE TOURING A SILK FACTORY

11:48.040 --> 11:50.167
{\an1}IN FRANCE.

11:50.251 --> 11:50.376
{\an1}YEAH.

11:50.459 --> 11:51.168
{\an1}A LONG STORY, SHORT,

11:51.252 --> 11:51.752
{\an1}THEY SPENT 19 HOURS

11:51.836 --> 11:52.711
{\an1}TRAPPED IN AN ELEVATOR.

11:52.795 --> 11:53.421
{\an1}WHEN THEY CAME OUT,

11:53.504 --> 11:54.630
{\an1}THEY WERE ENGAGED.

11:54.713 --> 11:55.631
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS BEAUTIFUL.

11:55.714 --> 11:56.424
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT WAS,

11:56.507 --> 11:56.924
{\an1}UNTIL SHE BROKE IT OFF

11:57.007 --> 11:58.467
{\an1}WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.718
{\an1}MAX IS STILL HOLDING OUT HOPE

11:59.802 --> 12:01.095
{\an1}THAT SHE'LL COME BACK.

12:01.178 --> 12:01.762
{\an1}HE SENDS HER A CHARM

12:01.846 --> 12:02.596
{\an1}FOR HER CHARM BRACELET

12:02.680 --> 12:03.848
{\an1}EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

12:03.931 --> 12:04.807
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHY A CHARM BRACELET?

12:04.890 --> 12:05.433
{\an1}&gt;&gt; MAX BELIEVES

12:05.516 --> 12:06.475
{\an1}IT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC PIECE

12:06.559 --> 12:07.935
{\an1}OF JEWELRY ON EARTH.

12:08.018 --> 12:10.646
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.032
{\an1}BUT FORGET IT

12:22.116 --> 12:24.743
{\an1}BECAUSE ROMANCE IS LAME.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.496
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NEWSFLASH.

12:27.580 --> 12:27.997
{\an1}IF MAX HEARS YOU TALKING

12:30.791 --> 12:32.293
{\an1}WHO'S NAME RHYMES

12:32.376 --> 12:34.044
{\an1}WITH LOFFI PAPARD,

12:34.128 --> 12:37.089
{\an1}HE'LL FIRE YOU ON THE SPOT.

12:37.173 --> 12:37.506
{\an1}ON SECOND THOUGHT,

12:37.590 --> 12:38.424
{\an1}MAYBE YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM

12:38.507 --> 12:39.175
{\an1}ABOUT IT.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.176
{\an1}THEN I CAN TURN YOUR OFFICE

12:40.259 --> 12:43.762
{\an1}INTO AN EXTRA CLOSET.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.514
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.348
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'VE GOT A PLAN.

12:46.432 --> 12:46.765
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T TELL ME

12:46.849 --> 12:47.558
{\an1}YOU'RE GONNA FIX HIM UP

12:47.641 --> 12:48.392
{\an1}WITH SOMEONE ELSE?

12:48.476 --> 12:48.934
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I'M GONNA FIX HIM UP

12:49.018 --> 12:51.228
{\an1}WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

12:51.312 --> 12:51.520
{\an1}MY MOM SAYS

12:51.604 --> 12:52.062
{\an1}YOU NEVER GET OVER A CRUSH

12:52.146 --> 12:55.900
{\an1}UNTIL YOU FIND A NEW ONE.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.694
{\an1}WHAT?

12:58.777 --> 13:02.406
{\an1}EVERYONE DESERVES LOVE.

13:02.490 --> 13:05.493
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT OLD PEOPLE.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.577
{\an1}&gt;&gt; BUT YOU HEARD AMANDA.

13:06.660 --> 13:07.161
{\an1}IF YOU GET INVOLVED,

13:07.244 --> 13:08.537
{\an1}MR. MADIGAN WILL FIRE YOU.

13:08.621 --> 13:09.788
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF HE FIRES ME.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.164
{\an1}I JUST WANNA SEE

13:10.247 --> 13:12.833
{\an1}MR. MADIGAN HAPPY.

13:12.917 --> 13:17.838
{\an1}WE'RE FINDING HIM A GIRLFRIEND.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.841
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LEAVE ME ALONE.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.762
{\an1}I MEAN, COME IN.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.680
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HI, MR. MADIGAN.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.015
{\an1}GOT A SECOND?

13:28.098 --> 13:29.058
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SURE, TRUE.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.184
{\an1}ALTHOUGH I MUST ADMIT I'M NOT

13:30.267 --> 13:32.520
{\an1}IN THE BEST MOOD RIGHT NOW.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.521
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, THAT'S OKAY.

13:33.604 --> 13:36.482
{\an1}WE'RE DOING A SURVEY

13:36.565 --> 13:37.149
{\an1}AND WE'RE WONDERING

13:37.233 --> 13:37.566
{\an1}IF YOU COULD ANSWER

13:37.650 --> 13:38.776
{\an1}A FEW QUESTIONS

13:38.859 --> 13:39.276
{\an1}ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE THINK

13:39.360 --> 13:41.111
{\an1}ABOUT THINGS.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.197
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW REFRESHINGLY VAGUE.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.950
{\an1}GO AHEAD.

13:46.033 --> 13:46.825
{\an1}&gt;&gt; GENERALLY, DO YOU LIKE

13:46.909 --> 13:48.953
{\an1}SHORT PEOPLE OR TALL PEOPLE?

13:49.036 --> 13:49.787
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHORT PEOPLE,

13:49.870 --> 13:50.996
{\an1}THEY'RE FANTASTIC.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.164
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO YOU LIKE SERIOUS PEOPLE

13:52.248 --> 13:53.123
{\an1}OR KIND OF FUNNY?

13:53.207 --> 13:54.583
{\an1}&gt;&gt; FUNNY, BUT NOT BLUE.

13:54.667 --> 13:54.959
{\an1}THERE'S NO CALL

13:55.042 --> 13:56.043
{\an1}FOR THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE.

13:56.126 --> 13:56.710
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW DO YOU FEEL

13:56.794 --> 13:57.253
{\an1}ABOUT POTATOES?

13:57.336 --> 13:57.878
{\an1}&gt;&gt; NOT A FAN,

13:57.962 --> 13:58.963
{\an1}UNLESS THEY'RE MASHED

13:59.046 --> 14:00.798
{\an1}THEN I LOVE THEM.

14:00.881 --> 14:01.632
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IF YOU WERE STUCK

14:01.715 --> 14:02.049
{\an1}ON A DESERT ISLAND

14:02.132 --> 14:04.093
{\an1}WITH ONE BOOK,

14:04.176 --> 14:04.927
{\an1}WHAT WOULD IT BE?

14:05.010 --> 14:06.720
{\an1}&gt;&gt; PROBABLY SOME SORT OF MANUAL

14:06.804 --> 14:08.472
{\an1}ON HOW TO GET OFF AN ISLAND.

14:08.556 --> 14:08.889
{\an1}&gt;&gt; CAN WE GET BACK

14:08.973 --> 14:09.723
{\an1}TO THE POTATO QUESTION

14:09.807 --> 14:10.224
{\an1}FOR A SECOND?

14:10.307 --> 14:10.849
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LADIES, LOOK.

14:10.933 --> 14:11.267
{\an1}I'M A LITTLE BUSY.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.434
{\an1}HOW MANY MORE QUESTIONS

14:12.518 --> 14:12.935
{\an1}DO YOU HAVE?

14:13.018 --> 14:18.399
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SIX HUNDRED.

14:18.482 --> 14:18.732
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT

14:18.816 --> 14:19.942
{\an1}MY GREAT AUNT MUSHKE?

14:20.025 --> 14:20.317
{\an1}SHE'S REALLY SHORT

14:20.401 --> 14:23.028
{\an1}AND SHE LOVES MASHED POTATOES.

14:23.112 --> 14:23.988
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ISN'T SHE LIKE 80?

14:24.071 --> 14:24.863
{\an1}&gt;&gt; HOW OLD IS MR. MADIGAN?

14:24.947 --> 14:27.783
{\an1}&gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW BUT NOT 80.

14:27.866 --> 14:29.827
{\an1}&gt;&gt; ANYONE OVER 17

14:29.910 --> 14:31.745
{\an1}MIGHT AS WELL BE 80.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.915
{\an1}THAT'S RIGHT, I SAID IT.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.001
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT ABOUT MRS. MORA?

14:37.084 --> 14:37.751

{\an1}&gt;&gt; DO YOU EVEN KNOW

14:40.379 --> 14:41.797
{\an1}WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE?

14:41.880 --> 14:42.214
{\an1}WE'RE TRYING TO FIND

14:42.298 --> 14:44.633
{\an1}A SINGLE WOMAN FOR MR. MADIGAN

14:44.717 --> 14:48.887
{\an1}TO FALL IN LOVE WITH.

14:48.971 --> 14:51.265
{\an1}WAIT, HE LIKES READING.

14:51.348 --> 14:52.933

{\an1}NOT ME.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.537
{\an1}I'M SO HAPPY I COULD SING.

{\an1}I KNOW ABOUT SOPHIE GIRARD.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.059
{\an1}&gt;&gt; YOU'RE FIRED.

15:35.142 --> 15:36.060
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, I KIND OF THOUGHT

15:36.143 --> 15:37.936
{\an1}AMANDA WAS EXAGGERATING

15:38.020 --> 15:39.605
{\an1}BUT OKAY.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.106

15:51.200 --> 15:51.575
{\an1}YOU'D FORGET ALL ABOUT

15:51.659 --> 15:52.660
{\an1}SOPHIE GIRARD.

{\an1}WHAT IF PEOPLE FROM WORK SEE ME?

16:45.295 --> 16:47.297
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.048

16:48.132 --> 16:51.677
{\an1}EVER GOES THERE.

17:50.110 --> 17:50.527
{\an1}&gt;&gt; IT'S A FREE COUNTRY.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.446

{\an1}BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT

17:54.531 --> 17:56.784
{\an1}ANYONE HE KNOWS TO SEE HIM HERE.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.743
{\an1}&gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY,

17:57.826 --> 18:01.830
{\an1}WE'RE PRACTICALLY INVISIBLE.

18:02.039 --> 18:08.086
{\an1}&gt;&gt; LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.046
{\an1}OH, HI, AMANDA.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.904
{\an1}I LOVE MOVING.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.197
{\an1}I'VE HAD 18 DIFFERENT APARTMENTS

18:35.280 --> 18:36.156
{\an1}IN THE LAST THREE YEARS.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.408
{\an1}IF I STAY IN ONE PLACE TOO LONG,

18:38.492 --> 18:39.993
{\an1}IT'S LIKE I CAN'T BREATHE.

18:40.077 --> 18:40.536
{\an1}OH LOOK, SHE'S GETTING UP.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.037
{\an1}LET'S SIT OVER HERE.

{\an1}&gt;&gt; ACTUALLY, WHAT DO YOU SAY

18:44.498 --> 18:45.999
{\an1}I BUY YOU A YOGURT?

{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.002

19:37.885 --> 19:39.011
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WELL, NOT UNTIL SHE THREW

19:39.094 --> 19:42.180
{\an1}A STOOL AT THE YOGURT MACHINE.

19:42.264 --> 19:45.726
{\an1}&gt;&gt; OH, HI, MR. MADIGAN.

19:45.809 --> 19:46.977

19:53.817 --> 19:55.527
{\an1}AND I LOVED IT.

19:55.611 --> 19:56.570
{\an1}&gt;&gt; WHAT?

19:56.653 --> 19:57.779
{\an1}&gt;&gt; SHE'S THE MOST EXCITING

19:57.863 --> 19:59.907
{\an1}BALL OF CRAZY I'VE EVER MET.

{\an1}CAN YOU BACK UP?

20:05.203 --> 20:05.871
{\an1}IT DOESN'T SEEM

20:05.954 --> 20:06.705
{\an1}THE WAY SHE ACTED

20:06.788 --> 20:07.706
{\an1}IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAD

20:07.789 --> 20:09.041
{\an1}ON YOUR LIST.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.626
{\an1}&gt;&gt; THAT'S JUST IT, TRUE.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.294
{\an1}LOVE ISN'T ABOUT LISTS.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.296
{\an1}LOVE IS ABOUT A FEELING YOU GET

20:14.379 --> 20:15.422
{\an1}IN YOUR STOMACH

20:15.505 --> 20:15.797
{\an1}LIKE WHEN YOU SEE
