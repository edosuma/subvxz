00:16.018 --> 00:17.348
Hello

00:17.368 --> 00:19.988
Oh, yes, this is Ima Sher.

00:20.088 --> 00:21.568
Ima Sher who?

00:21.568 --> 00:24.458
I-m-a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama!

00:27.538 --> 00:31.368
You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!

00:31.458 --> 00:34.648
The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet,

00:34.648 --> 00:35.748
right, Mordecai?

00:35.748 --> 00:38.568
Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny.

00:38.708 --> 00:42.388
But you know what is even funnier than watching prank phone calls?

00:50.548 --> 00:51.688
Hello?

00:51.738 --> 00:53.808
- Hello, Pops? - Yes?

00:55.808 --> 00:58.168
Please hold for a collect call from...

00:58.288 --> 00:59.718
Joe Mama!

01:04.897 --> 01:05.718
Hello?

01:05.728 --> 01:09.418
Hey, Skips, do you have a son named Joe Mama?

01:09.458 --> 01:10.518
Excuse me?

01:15.958 --> 01:16.678
Hello?

01:16.748 --> 01:20.888
Hey, Benson, you got any books by Joe Mama?

01:20.908 --> 01:22.018
Who is this!?

01:23.738 --> 01:25.088
Whenever this is coming from,

01:25.088 --> 01:28.068
I will track you down and I will find you if it...

01:28.068 --> 01:29.188
Dude, he's still on the phone!

01:29.188 --> 01:31.788
- He's still on the phone?! - He's still on the phone!!!

01:37.688 --> 01:42.478
Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?

01:42.688 --> 01:45.128
Yeah, second best.

01:45.198 --> 01:47.458
What!? Uh! Did you not hear what we just did?

01:47.458 --> 01:48.898
We were hilarious!

01:48.898 --> 01:53.198
Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this.

01:54.618 --> 01:55.628
Who you calling?

01:55.728 --> 01:57.808
The Master Prank Caller.

01:57.808 --> 01:59.608
Holy crap!

01:59.608 --> 02:00.918
Hang up that phone!

02:01.068 --> 02:03.018
You think your little pranks are funny, huh?

02:03.018 --> 02:04.008
You think they're funny?

02:04.008 --> 02:06.088
Well, what do you guys think of my prank?

02:06.098 --> 02:08.967
Ring, ring. Hello, what's that?

02:08.997 --> 02:12.238
Mordecai and Rigby are banned from using the house phone?

02:12.258 --> 02:13.158
Okay.

02:17.298 --> 02:19.818
Good luck making your prank calls now!

02:23.848 --> 02:26.228
Dude, let's go use Pops' phone.

02:27.588 --> 02:29.498
Pops, can we borrow your phone?

02:29.788 --> 02:34.158
Oh, I would, but I'm holding to talk to Joe Mama!

02:37.118 --> 02:40.258
But you're welcome to use the phones under my bed.

02:40.598 --> 02:42.778
Aww, cool! What kind are they?

02:44.588 --> 02:46.848
Aw! 80's cellphones!

02:46.978 --> 02:49.338
Cool. Thanks, Pops.

02:49.338 --> 02:52.228
Oh, and boys... do be careful.

02:52.278 --> 02:54.718
I think they might cause brain tumors.

03:03.288 --> 03:06.488
All right. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.

03:06.598 --> 03:08.488
Okay, here I go.

03:12.198 --> 03:15.498
- Hello? - Yeah, this is, uh, pizza delivery guy?

03:15.698 --> 03:17.778
I have 50 pizzas here you ordered.

03:19.428 --> 03:21.038
Sounds great. Bring em' over.

03:21.698 --> 03:24.268
Uh, you ordered 50 pizzas?

03:24.318 --> 03:25.958
Yeah, and hot wings.

03:25.968 --> 03:27.268
Get here quick, okay?

03:27.268 --> 03:29.178
Your mom's like totally starving.

03:29.328 --> 03:31.548
Yeah, uh, okay. I got to go.

03:32.018 --> 03:33.528
Let me take a crack at it.

03:34.618 --> 03:35.338
Hello?

03:35.378 --> 03:37.898
- Hi, this is Stan. - Stan who?

03:39.978 --> 03:42.588
Stan... Stanminson.

03:42.658 --> 03:44.738
Your name is Stan Stanminson?

03:45.788 --> 03:46.218
Uh... yep.

03:46.258 --> 03:49.438
Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.678
And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?

03:51.808 --> 03:52.658
I don't know.

03:52.758 --> 03:56.048
Now listen up, stop calling here or I'm going to make you sorry!

03:56.968 --> 03:58.648
Woah, this guy's good.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.648
I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

04:00.648 --> 04:02.068
What, you givin' up?

04:02.158 --> 04:03.988
Dude, we can prank this guy.

04:04.088 --> 04:05.508
Do you want to be this guy's son,

04:05.508 --> 04:07.178
or do you want to be number one?

04:08.928 --> 04:09.808
Let's do it.

04:11.648 --> 04:14.048
- Hello, Master Prank Caller, this is... - Heard it.

04:16.618 --> 04:18.708
- Yeah buddy, its Joe Ma.. - Heard it.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.748
- Yeah, hello... - You got anything original?

04:23.748 --> 04:24.918
"Yeah hello?"

04:24.948 --> 04:26.768
Dude, that was the worst try yet!

04:26.768 --> 04:28.818
Time to put an end to this junk fest.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.798
Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.

04:33.808 --> 04:36.588
Yeah right, like your 50 pizzas thing was way better!

04:36.908 --> 04:39.858
Whatever Stan Manastan, man.

04:42.618 --> 04:44.688
Nice try, dude. I know it's you.

04:45.208 --> 04:47.038
Uh... not me, dude.

04:48.798 --> 04:49.658
Hello?

04:49.798 --> 04:52.478
Is this the pizza guy or Stan Stanminson?

04:52.938 --> 04:54.278
Uh... both.

04:54.328 --> 04:56.078
I thought i told you to leave me alone.

04:56.198 --> 04:58.078
Now I'm going to prank you so hard,

04:58.078 --> 04:59.798
your both going to poop a duke.

04:59.798 --> 05:04.428
they want their cell phones back!

05:20.888 --> 05:22.488
Where are we?

05:22.488 --> 05:24.488
Dude, I think we're back at the park.

05:24.488 --> 05:25.378
Are we?

05:25.378 --> 05:26.188
What do you mean?

05:26.258 --> 05:27.908
Dude, all the trees are small,

05:27.908 --> 05:30.258
and look at that park bench, it's so new looking.

05:30.318 --> 05:32.198
I'm telling you, something weird's going on.

05:32.608 --> 05:34.708
Look there's Pops. Let's go ask him.

05:34.838 --> 05:36.418
Pops! Hey Pops,

05:36.538 --> 05:38.628
can you tell Rigby here that everything is fine?

05:38.848 --> 05:39.808
What now?

05:40.828 --> 05:42.988
Why does Pops look so young?

05:43.298 --> 05:45.428
Now then, who are you gentlemen?

05:45.478 --> 05:46.858
How do you know my name?

05:46.928 --> 05:49.178
Pops! It's us, Mordecai and Rigby.

05:49.268 --> 05:52.298
But I've never met either of you gentlemen in my entire life.

05:52.458 --> 05:53.318
What?

05:53.318 --> 05:55.798
I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on here.

05:58.988 --> 06:00.778
- Hey, guys! - What?

06:00.878 --> 06:03.448
Do you notice anything strange going on around here?

06:03.448 --> 06:05.448
Is he getting fresh with us?

06:05.528 --> 06:08.158
Yo, I think he's up in our threads, homefry.

06:08.238 --> 06:10.468
That dillweed just barfed me out.

06:11.558 --> 06:14.558
Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries?

06:14.618 --> 06:16.518
We're in the 80s, dude!

06:16.508 --> 06:17.848
Pops, what year is this?

06:17.848 --> 06:20.048
Well, it's 1982, of course.

06:20.138 --> 06:20.968
See?

06:21.078 --> 06:22.308
Dude, this is bad.

06:22.308 --> 06:24.838
I know. I don't even like the 80s that much!

06:24.838 --> 06:26.368
The only way were going to get back is that

06:26.368 --> 06:28.658
we prank him harder than he pranked us.

06:28.698 --> 06:29.948
Let's do it.

06:31.188 --> 06:31.858
Hello?

06:31.928 --> 06:33.738
The 60s called, they want their..

06:33.738 --> 06:35.288
What did I tell you about calling me?!

06:35.288 --> 06:36.998
- Hang up! Hang up! - I can't!

06:43.888 --> 06:45.728
You couldn't leave me alone.

06:45.968 --> 06:47.608
Now you're gonna pay!

06:48.818 --> 06:50.338
We should get out of here.

06:51.288 --> 06:52.178
The cart!

06:57.068 --> 06:57.828
Hello?

06:57.828 --> 07:00.578
The 80s called. They still want ya!

07:05.728 --> 07:08.738
Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the 80s!

07:09.398 --> 07:11.668
Listen, just leave us alone, will ya?!

07:11.668 --> 07:13.468
Don't ever hang up on me!

07:18.038 --> 07:20.458
Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!

07:20.508 --> 07:21.298

07:30.438 --> 07:31.778
Who are you talking to?

07:31.778 --> 07:33.638
Why it's Mordecai and Rigby.

07:33.628 --> 07:35.668
They're stuck in the 1980s.

07:35.668 --> 07:37.018
Oh, really?

07:37.208 --> 07:38.578
Hello?

07:38.578 --> 07:41.758
Benson, you got to help us! We're stuck in 1982!

07:43.788 --> 07:46.178
That's really something, Mordecai.

07:46.178 --> 07:47.928
Crap, he thinks we're pranking him!

07:47.928 --> 07:49.158
What?! Give me that!

07:49.188 --> 07:51.338
The 80s called, they want their cell phones back!

07:56.238 --> 07:57.308
What just happened?!

07:57.308 --> 07:59.458
We need your help to prank the Master Prank Caller.

07:59.498 --> 08:00.098
Who?

08:00.198 --> 08:01.718
Why did you prank him?

08:02.508 --> 08:03.898
I'll take care of this.

08:03.938 --> 08:04.848
Hello?

08:04.848 --> 08:07.008
Nice ride... but I like mine better.

08:15.838 --> 08:18.518
Forget the phone, hold the wheel steady!

08:34.488 --> 08:36.118
Don't answer it, don't answer!

08:36.118 --> 08:37.727
Mordecai! Look out!

08:42.058 --> 08:44.448
Dude, we just hit past Pops!

09:00.368 --> 09:02.048
Can I help you with anything?

09:02.778 --> 09:04.188
Dude. I got an idea.

09:05.318 --> 09:07.788
Quick, get to the field! Everybody hide!

09:09.558 --> 09:10.348
Over there!

09:11.428 --> 09:13.608
Man, I hope this works.

09:13.638 --> 09:14.878
It will, Mordecai.

09:14.998 --> 09:15.898
It has to.

09:19.568 --> 09:20.138
Hello?

09:20.438 --> 09:22.428
This is The Master Prank Caller telling you--

09:22.428 --> 09:22.918
Hello?

09:22.978 --> 09:25.038
- I said this is The Master Prank-- - Hello?

09:25.038 --> 09:26.748
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

09:26.748 --> 09:28.798
I said this is The Master Prank Caller!

09:28.798 --> 09:30.278
Hello, hello, are you there?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.518
I SAID--

09:33.198 --> 09:36.258
Just kidding. You just got pranked, loser!

09:36.898 --> 09:39.018
NOOOOOOO--!!!

09:39.018 --> 09:39.758
Now!

09:44.218 --> 09:46.658
Now, Rigby, hit the power button!

09:46.658 --> 09:49.448
Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?!

09:49.448 --> 09:51.448
No! NO! NOOOOO--!!!

09:55.018 --> 09:56.368
In your face!

09:56.428 --> 09:59.218
Who's the master prank caller now, you loser?!

10:03.298 --> 10:04.448
Guys, this is it,

10:04.548 --> 10:06.408
Guys, this is it, it's the way back! Come on!

10:11.608 --> 10:13.828
One of these doors leads us back to the present.

10:20.628 --> 10:21.548
There it is.

10:25.498 --> 10:26.188
Wait.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.818
You guys were better than me today,

10:31.138 --> 10:32.958
but you can't leave me here.

10:34.338 --> 10:38.398
All I ever wanted to do was make prank calls like you.

10:39.068 --> 10:41.578
Was that so wrong?

10:49.348 --> 10:50.478
Hello?

10:50.478 --> 10:52.598
1, 2, 3!

10:52.598 --> 10:55.448
The 70s called: they want their chair back!
