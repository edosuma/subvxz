00:04.588 --> 00:05.965
Hey, Bert.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.174
What are you doing?

00:07.258 --> 00:08.676
These two people went through
a terrible divorce,

00:08.759 --> 00:10.386
they haven't talked
to each other for a year.

00:10.469 --> 00:12.471
I just want them to be happy. That's it.

00:12.555 --> 00:14.056
Sharon?
Bert?

00:15.599 --> 00:17.476
Toddler in Treatment Six.
Parents just got here.

00:17.560 --> 00:20.104
If there are natural options
without side effects,

00:20.187 --> 00:21.313
we try those first.

00:21.397 --> 00:23.107
Perhaps a more immediate treatment...

00:23.190 --> 00:24.817
You mean antibiotics? No.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.862
On the outside, he may look normal,
but on the inside,

00:27.945 --> 00:30.656
pneumonia is notorious
for its slow progression.

00:30.740 --> 00:32.450
You scare people with diagnoses

00:32.533 --> 00:34.326
and then you sell them
on treatments they don't need.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.245
WILL: This is the second time this month

00:36.328 --> 00:38.122
that parents have lost faith
in your judgment.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.665
No more. We're going home.

00:39.749 --> 00:42.334
He needs these antibiotics. Now!
No!

00:42.418 --> 00:44.378
NOAH: Hey!
JANET: Security!

00:44.462 --> 00:46.505
Are you out of your mind?
Security!

00:46.589 --> 00:49.133
It's okay, buddy.
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:49.216 --> 00:50.426
NOAH: Open this door!

00:52.219 --> 00:53.888
SHARON: Well? Where are we?

00:53.971 --> 00:57.224
In a better position
than we were four hours ago, but barely.

00:57.308 --> 01:00.019
Lucky for you, Kalmick
did some quick maneuvering

01:00.102 --> 01:02.021
and wrangled up a court order
to treat Lucas.

01:02.104 --> 01:03.773
Well, that's a relief.

01:03.856 --> 01:08.235
Still, there's no excuse
for your extremely reckless behavior.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.946
I made every effort to keep
Dr. Manning on a short leash.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.740
I understand my actions appear rash...

01:12.823 --> 01:14.950
You locked that boy in a room!
I didn't have a choice.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.036
Kidnapped him from his guardians.

01:17.119 --> 01:18.496
They were risking his life!

01:18.579 --> 01:23.083
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why don't we all
just bring it down a few notches, okay?

01:24.376 --> 01:27.755
Dr. Manning, you understand
administering antibiotics

01:27.838 --> 01:31.675
against the parents' wishes
and before securing a court order

01:31.759 --> 01:34.637
left this hospital open
for a major lawsuit.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.847
Lucas' parents gave me no other options.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.766
Okay? They were unwilling
to accept the diagnosis

01:38.849 --> 01:39.850
and wanted to leave the hospital.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.228
Well, she's right about that.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.898
I want that boy discharged
as soon as possible.

01:51.821 --> 01:52.988
Not so fast.

01:55.991 --> 01:58.077
If you are in any way compromised,

01:58.953 --> 02:01.747
you need to recuse yourself
from this case immediately.

02:01.831 --> 02:05.042
I assure you,
my medical judgment is sound.

02:06.460 --> 02:10.798
I hope for Lucas' sake,
and your own, that that's true.

02:17.555 --> 02:18.806
Hey, I heard what happened.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.058
I don't need another
lecture right now. (SIGHS)

02:21.934 --> 02:23.352
I wasn't gonna lecture you.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.770
I was gonna offer to talk...
I don't need to be supervised,

02:24.854 --> 02:26.647
and I don't need your help.

02:29.233 --> 02:30.234
(BIRD SCREECHING)

02:31.694 --> 02:33.904
Hey. Just cleared
two more shelves for you.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.825
Can you just give me
the guest room closet? His and hers.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.285
All yours, have at it.

02:39.368 --> 02:40.578
And after we're married,

02:40.661 --> 02:44.206
you know we're getting a bigger place,
right? With a lot of closets.

02:44.290 --> 02:45.666
Ah, yes, ma'am.

02:46.458 --> 02:49.420
Good news. I got out of pulling
a double tomorrow. Dinner and a movie?

02:49.503 --> 02:51.839
I can't. Training a new nurse.

02:52.631 --> 02:53.966
How about Saturday?

02:54.758 --> 02:56.635
I got that Navy recruiting event.

02:56.719 --> 02:58.470
I do have a lunch break from 1:00 to 1:30.

02:58.554 --> 03:01.223
What are we gonna do with half an hour?

03:01.974 --> 03:05.686
Oh... I have some ideas.

No. No. I can't be here.

05:09.101 --> 05:10.936
It's okay.
We didn't call the police.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.688
But you shouldn't move right now.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.649
You suffered a small pneumothorax.
A collapsed lung.

05:15.733 --> 05:16.859

We gave you some morphine for the pain.

Your lung should re–expand on its own,

to stay in bed for a while.

what happened this morning?

before you walked in the door.

Literally, a minute.

her actions or saying I agree, I just...

is in the right place.

Not exactly a name
that you hear every day.

No, it isn't. Grew up
down the street from me.

on other areas of my life.

I hope I didn't pull you
away from anything?

07:53.140 --> 07:55.642
It's just, I find doctors
can be a bit intrusive.

07:56.393 --> 07:59.062
And I remember you as being
so sweet and respectful.

how today's gonna pan out.

isn't even discharged yet,

He's got a "No Blood" card in his wallet.
He's a Jehovah's Witness.

Doris, let me see that.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.513
Okay, card's almost a decade old.

10:39.723 --> 10:41.350
It was signed by his parents
when he was still a minor.

10:41.433 --> 10:44.061
All right, well let's get them down here
and ask 'em about it then.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.606

Yeah?

10:58.367 --> 10:59.785
Lucas' latest labs.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.079
How's he looking?
His temp just spiked again

11:02.162 --> 11:03.914
to 102.2. Higher than before.

11:04.706 --> 11:06.875
His sputum gram stain came back negative.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.336
It's not pneumonia.

11:10.128 --> 11:11.296
I can double–check with the lab.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.382
No. No, that's okay. Just...

11:15.217 --> 11:20.055
Okay. If it's not pneumonia,
but... Let me think.

Keep his fluids at 100
and add vancomycin to his antibiotics.

under that assumption. For now.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.750
I thought she was terrified of hospitals.

12:30.834 --> 12:34.629
Yeah. And get this, she listed
a social security number.

12:34.713 --> 12:35.922
Was it real?
Yeah.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.341
Turns out she was born in Indiana.

about being undocumented?

Yes. We're ready to go.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.936
Natalie, wait!

23:15.019 --> 23:17.313
Lucas' parents had their lawyer
look into the court order.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.441
They just found out that you started
treating him prior to having it.

23:20.525 --> 23:21.526

24:16.289 --> 24:19.625
Claire's been taking feminizing
hormone therapy for a little over a year.

24:21.586 --> 24:24.589
And coronary artery disease
is a possible contraindication.

24:24.672 --> 24:27.550
And cardiology is advising
that she go off the hormones.

I don't think David's a practicing
Jehovah's Witness.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.529
Because there's booze in his system?
That's a big reach.

24:48.613 --> 24:51.157
His blood alcohol level's
three times the legal limit.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.408
And he tested positive for marijuana.

24:52.491 --> 24:55.828
So, he isn't winning Witness of the Year.
Doesn't mean he left the faith.

24:56.537 --> 25:00.249
And his tattoo? You know what it is?
A symbol for the Holy Trinity.

25:00.333 --> 25:02.627
Witnesses don't believe
in the Trinity doctrine.

25:03.211 --> 25:04.378
Someone's been studying up.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.549
What if he converted
and didn't tell his parents?

25:08.633 --> 25:10.384
Speculation, at best.

25:10.468 --> 25:12.553
A tattoo is not an advanced directive.

25:13.179 --> 25:17.642
Look, fact is, David was in the ED
less than a year ago with strep throat,

25:17.725 --> 25:20.645
and put his parents down
as his emergency contact.

25:20.728 --> 25:21.812
That was strep throat.

25:21.896 --> 25:24.273
I doubt he imagined they'd be choosing
whether he lives or dies.

Sharon. You came.

37:20.656 --> 37:22.699
Well, I wasn't sure I was going to.

37:24.910 --> 37:25.911
Please.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.332
You still take your whisky neat?

37:31.375 --> 37:32.709
Better make it a double.

37:33.460 --> 37:34.461
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

37:35.170 --> 37:39.257
Excuse me, miss? Whiskey, double?
WAITRESS: Whiskey double.

37:49.142 --> 37:51.770
Oh, good. I hate to drink alone.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.480
No, thanks.

37:54.481 --> 37:55.816
We're off duty.

37:57.442 --> 37:58.443
It'll be all right.

38:09.079 --> 38:10.122
Oh.

38:11.248 --> 38:12.624
Well, come on, you can say it.

38:12.708 --> 38:14.501
Oh, I don't like to kick a man
when he's down.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.337
Especially when it looks like
he's beaten me to it.

38:18.797 --> 38:20.882
Besides, you did save that boy's life.

38:20.966 --> 38:23.135
Yeah, but he thinks it's cost him
his eternal life.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.680
I was convinced David
was no longer a Witness.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.726
I couldn't accept the choice
his parents were making.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.394
Yeah, you weren't altogether wrong.

38:33.186 --> 38:35.564
You heard the kid, you know,
he was questioning his faith.

38:36.481 --> 38:38.400
I did the same thing to Natalie.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.735
What's that?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.862
I wanted to believe, because of her TBI,

38:41.945 --> 38:44.322
that she didn't remember
she still loved me.

38:44.406 --> 38:45.532
(SCOFFS)

38:45.615 --> 38:47.200
The truth is, she chose Phillip.

38:47.284 --> 38:49.578
Right, that night in my car,
she was coming to tell me she was engaged,

38:49.661 --> 38:53.248
show me her ring.
I didn't wanna accept it.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.750
I don't know
what she was gonna say to you,

38:54.833 --> 38:57.169
but I do know she wasn't gonna
show you any ring.

39:00.839 --> 39:01.840
What are you talking about?

39:08.472 --> 39:11.433
Hey! Do you need a second to change?

39:11.516 --> 39:12.726
We can always go back to your place.

39:12.809 --> 39:15.812
I think the reservations will be held for,
like, 15 minutes or something.

39:15.896 --> 39:17.606
No. I'm not going to dinner.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.649
Oh!

39:20.692 --> 39:23.278
Is everything okay with your patient?
Yeah. My patient's fine.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.489
It's about us.

39:27.616 --> 39:28.617
What about us?

39:30.827 --> 39:31.828
(SIGHS)

39:32.454 --> 39:35.791
On the surface, everything seems perfect,

39:35.874 --> 39:39.211
but in my gut, it just doesn't feel right.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.964
I'm sorry, Phillip,
but I have to trust my instincts.

39:44.841 --> 39:45.926
I can't marry you.

39:47.594 --> 39:48.595
Natalie, can...

39:48.678 --> 39:50.764
Please just leave it at that. I'm sorry.

39:51.473 --> 39:52.474
Natalie!

39:55.143 --> 39:57.312
He's been lying to you. What?

39:58.313 --> 40:00.273
He slipped the ring on your finger
when you were unconscious.

40:01.775 --> 40:05.112
I don't... Wait, I don't understand.
What does he mean?

40:06.029 --> 40:09.908
You never said you'd marry him.
He made you think that.

40:09.991 --> 40:10.992
Is that true?

40:11.952 --> 40:14.204
No. Of course not.

40:14.287 --> 40:16.832
Natalie, look at him, he's jealous.

40:16.915 --> 40:19.000
He's looking at you right now
and lying to you.

40:19.084 --> 40:23.255
You know what? It doesn't matter.
Because it's over.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.967
Hey! Natalie.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.885
Hey, you stay away from her.

40:32.806 --> 40:36.101
From the moment I met him...
Just stop.

40:36.184 --> 40:38.061
Look, I'm sorry. I just...
I should've done something.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.354
No!
Said something.

40:39.437 --> 40:42.482
Here you are again trying to save me!

40:42.566 --> 40:45.152
I can take care of myself.

40:45.235 --> 40:48.446
I don't need your help.
I don't want your help.

40:52.117 --> 40:56.413
Please. Just get out of my life.

41:13.346 --> 41:15.348
