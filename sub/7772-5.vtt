00:12.100 --> 00:13.600
*

00:18.333 --> 00:21.300
- If you're watching
this VHS--yes, VHS.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.667
I bought thousands of 'em.
I've got to use 'em somehow.

00:23.767 --> 00:26.133
Anyway,
if you're watching this,

00:26.233 --> 00:28.467
it means--

00:28.567 --> 00:31.633
well, it means I'm dead.

00:31.733 --> 00:33.567
- Oh, my God.

00:35.733 --> 00:37.533
I'm joshing you, Billie.
I'm not dead.

00:37.633 --> 00:40.967
However, the same cannot be
said of the wood in this house.

00:41.067 --> 00:44.300
It is--it is infested
with termites,

00:44.400 --> 00:46.133
so Tanzy and I,

00:46.233 --> 00:48.467
we're headed off to Mexico
for the weekend to,

00:48.567 --> 00:50.000
you know, avoid the fumes.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.967
I'm sure
you can handle everything.

00:52.067 --> 00:53.500
I've already called
the exterminator.

00:53.600 --> 00:56.000
You're welcome.
- Thank you.

00:56.100 --> 00:59.200
- Uh, well, that's it.
End communication.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.533
- Hi.

01:01.733 --> 01:03.700
- I'm Fran,
the exterminator.

01:03.800 --> 01:06.567
I let myself in,
like the bugs.

01:15.067 --> 01:16.300
Ahh.

01:16.400 --> 01:18.300
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:18.400 --> 01:19.967
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:20.067 --> 01:21.667
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:21.767 --> 01:24.200
Ha ha!

01:24.300 --> 01:25.967
- So this is
our most ecofriendly option,

01:26.067 --> 01:28.667
kind of gets rid of the termites
without getting rid of the bees,

01:28.767 --> 01:30.200
which apparently we need.

01:30.300 --> 01:31.667
It takes a week,

01:31.767 --> 01:35.600
and it works
approximately 20% of the time.

01:35.700 --> 01:36.767
- Don't love those odds.

01:36.867 --> 01:38.433
- We also have
this option here.

01:38.533 --> 01:40.067
It's our most popular.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.133
It does leave
a residual smell,

01:42.233 --> 01:43.167
kind of like
a really old coffee.

01:43.267 --> 01:44.633
I enjoy it personally,

01:44.733 --> 01:47.067
and that one works, eh,
a solid 35% of the time.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.067
- Do you have anything
that works all the time?

01:49.100 --> 01:51.067
Or...

01:53.800 --> 01:55.367
- I mean...
- Oh.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.633
- Can you trust--yes.

01:59.733 --> 02:01.500
- I can trust you.
- Yes.

02:01.600 --> 02:03.533
- Okay.

02:03.633 --> 02:06.067
I mean, you can't tell
anybody this, okay?

02:06.100 --> 02:09.333
I've been working on
a solution, a mixture...

02:09.433 --> 02:10.600
- Uh-huh.

02:10.700 --> 02:11.600
- In a little shed
outside in the back--

02:13.367 --> 02:16.933
- It's--it's actually my ticket
out of this uniform.

02:17.067 --> 02:17.967
- Okay.

02:18.067 --> 02:19.400
- I named it
after my sick kid.

02:19.500 --> 02:20.600
Did I tell you
I have a sick kid?

02:20.700 --> 02:22.067
- No, I just met you.
- Yeah.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.500
His name's Rico.
- Okay.

02:23.600 --> 02:25.067
That's a nice name.

02:25.100 --> 02:26.667
Anyway, the formula?

02:26.767 --> 02:31.133
- It's just, you can't
tell anybody about it, okay?

02:31.233 --> 02:32.500
I mean, I swear.
- Okay.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.267
- I swear on my sick kid.
- Oh, okay.

02:35.367 --> 02:37.067
You don't have to do that.

02:37.100 --> 02:40.400
- So that main--

02:40.500 --> 02:42.167
what do you call that
little guest house out there?

02:42.267 --> 02:43.267
That's clear.
- Guest house.

02:43.367 --> 02:44.800
- Yeah, this main house,

02:44.900 --> 02:46.267
you're gonna have to tent
the whole thing.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.900
- You know what that means,
don't you?

02:48.067 --> 02:48.967
- Oh, my God, have you
been there the whole time?

02:49.067 --> 02:51.800
- Slumber party!
Right?

02:51.900 --> 02:55.067
- I'm in. I mean,
I don't know about Rico, but...

02:55.100 --> 02:56.833
I'm in.

02:56.933 --> 02:58.100
- I think she just means us.

02:58.200 --> 03:01.067
- Oh, no, he can come.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.167
I didn't do it.

03:03.267 --> 03:04.900
- 100% termites.

03:05.067 --> 03:07.333
- We'll do the weird
top-secret formula. Not weird.

03:07.433 --> 03:09.433
We'll do the--we'll do Rico.

03:09.533 --> 03:11.100
*

03:12.967 --> 03:16.467
It's ringing.
Shh.

03:18.300 --> 03:19.633
You do it.
No, you.

03:19.733 --> 03:20.900
Joy?

03:21.067 --> 03:23.267
This is the policia.

03:23.367 --> 03:27.567
Your parents,
they--they died.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.967
- Yeah, they died
two years ago.

03:31.067 --> 03:32.600
- Hang up before she knows
who it is.

03:32.700 --> 03:34.467
- Okay. Sorry, Joy.
It's Gene and Billie.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.467
- Oh, I don't know.

03:38.567 --> 03:40.467
This is fun,
though, right?

03:40.567 --> 03:42.700
Slumber party
was a good call, huh?

03:42.800 --> 03:45.433
- Thank you.
I've actually never been to one.

03:45.533 --> 03:46.967
Moms used to always say
that I was, like,

03:47.067 --> 03:48.733
too loud or something.
- Yeah.

03:48.833 --> 03:50.733
- I never knew
what they were talking about.

03:50.833 --> 03:52.467
- I can see that.

03:52.567 --> 03:53.900
- The too loud thing.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.800
- Like personality
or just vocally?

03:55.900 --> 03:58.600
- Vocally.
- Yeah.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.700
- Well, you--obviously,
you know my whole history

04:01.800 --> 04:02.700
with slumber parties.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.067
- No.

04:04.133 --> 04:06.300
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Cool.

04:06.400 --> 04:09.100
- I mean,
I was invited to one once.

04:09.200 --> 04:10.267
- W--
- I--

04:10.367 --> 04:11.900
But I choose
not to discuss it.

04:12.067 --> 04:14.067
- All right, yeah,
I mean, if it's a bummer,

04:14.167 --> 04:15.567
I don't care
about hearing it.

04:15.667 --> 04:17.433
- I said I don't want
to talk about it.

04:17.533 --> 04:18.567
- Yeah.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.700
- All right.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.833
The elephant's
already in the room, you know?

04:22.933 --> 04:25.067
Might as well
give it a peanut.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.733
- The--give the elephant--

04:26.833 --> 04:28.367
- Give the elephant
a peanut?

04:28.467 --> 04:30.733
- Tell my story,
my tale of woe.

04:30.833 --> 04:32.733
- Is your story about
an elephant getting a peanut?

04:32.833 --> 04:34.533
- No, it's about
a slumber party.

04:34.633 --> 04:36.400
- Oh, I don't want
to hear that then.

04:39.867 --> 04:40.767
- Oh.

04:40.867 --> 04:41.767
That's her.

04:41.867 --> 04:43.433
Deborah Denise.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.500
- Ooh, two first names.
What a bitch.

04:45.600 --> 04:47.267
Which one are you?

04:47.367 --> 04:49.200
Oh, Jesus,
you look like a western ghost.

04:49.300 --> 04:51.367
- Yeah, I started high school
two years early,

04:51.467 --> 04:52.700
so I hadn't developed yet.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.733
Plus, I dressed like
Temple Grandin.

04:54.833 --> 04:57.100
- Oh, well, at least you got
invited to a slumber party.

04:57.200 --> 04:58.533
That's cool.
- Yeah, but that's it.

04:58.633 --> 05:00.133
It was a joke.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.133
When I got there,
they all threw flour at me.

05:03.867 --> 05:05.500
- Yeah, and they used to call me
"Grandma Billie"

05:05.600 --> 05:07.933
because they thought...
Sorry.

05:08.067 --> 05:10.833
- I was, like, buttoned-up
and boring, which is,

05:10.933 --> 05:13.567
like, totes cray, right?

05:13.667 --> 05:15.667
- Don't say that.

05:15.767 --> 05:17.867
- Plus, it didn't help that I
had foot surgery freshman year,

05:17.967 --> 05:19.967
so I had to walk with a cane.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.700
- Well, I wouldn't go to Deborah
Denise's stupid slumber party

05:22.800 --> 05:23.800
if she paid me to.

05:23.900 --> 05:25.700
- I would.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.867
- I mean only if she paid me.

05:27.967 --> 05:32.200
I don't have a lot of money
right now.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.200
Hey!

05:33.300 --> 05:35.967
- Knock it off, girl.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.467
- Stop!

05:37.567 --> 05:39.500
- Stop saying stupid stuff,
and I will, girl.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.300
- Stop saying "girl."

05:42.967 --> 05:44.300
That was a good one.

05:44.400 --> 05:45.967
Get it, Grandma.

05:46.067 --> 05:47.700
You got it, Grandma.

05:47.800 --> 05:50.233
- I'm not a grandma,
Deborah Denise!

05:50.333 --> 05:54.300
I hope you never have children
and they don't have children,

05:54.400 --> 05:56.633
so you will never be
a grandma!

05:56.733 --> 06:00.567
You  bitch!

06:03.200 --> 06:04.233
- Should we just
do something else?

06:04.333 --> 06:05.633
- Sorry.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.633
- Smokin'!

06:09.300 --> 06:12.967
I will reveal my croissant.

06:13.067 --> 06:15.333
From "The Mask,"
the movie.

06:15.433 --> 06:17.700
- Oh, God.
I love Cher.

06:19.067 --> 06:21.533
Never have I ever made out
with your dad.

06:21.633 --> 06:23.800
- Something you
think I have done.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.267
- Oh.
Okay, sorry about that.

06:25.367 --> 06:27.833
I dare you to eat
a tube of toothpaste.

06:27.933 --> 06:29.433
- I'd eat a little bite.

06:29.533 --> 06:31.700
- Burn your closet.
Cut yourself. Cut yourself.

06:31.800 --> 06:34.067
- Truth. Truth.
- Sweet bong.

06:34.133 --> 06:36.200
- That's not a bong.
That's my sleep apnea mask.

06:36.300 --> 06:38.600
- I don't want to talk about it.

06:38.700 --> 06:41.133
- Then we're not going to.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.433
Name a movie star you'd like
to have as your big brother.

06:44.533 --> 06:46.767
- That is tough one.
Ira Glass.

06:46.867 --> 06:48.067
No, that's too sexy.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.800
Never have I ever made out
with my dad.

06:53.633 --> 06:54.833
- Oh, my God.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.667
You made out with my dad?

06:56.767 --> 06:58.200
- No, I was just choking.

07:00.067 --> 07:00.900
- Gross.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.733
When your first kiss was.

07:04.833 --> 07:05.900
- 22.

07:08.433 --> 07:09.967
- Ed Begley, Jr.

07:10.067 --> 07:13.067
Ed Begley, Jr.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.833
- Oops.
I guess we're done.

07:16.933 --> 07:17.900
What are we gonna do next?

07:18.067 --> 07:20.833
Play hide

07:20.933 --> 07:23.733
- 58, 59, 60.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.900
Ready or not, here I come!

07:26.067 --> 07:28.267
I'm actually pretty good
at this, Gene.

07:28.367 --> 07:32.667
I was hide-and-seek champion
in my middle school.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.067
They had to close down
the school

07:35.167 --> 07:38.400
and bring in scent dogs to..

07:38.500 --> 07:41.633
find me.

07:41.733 --> 07:43.633
Oh, no.

07:43.733 --> 07:45.067
Gene!

07:45.100 --> 07:46.833
Gene?

07:48.267 --> 07:50.633
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

07:50.733 --> 07:52.900
Gene!

07:53.067 --> 07:54.367
Gene?

07:55.700 --> 07:56.867
Gene?

07:57.933 --> 07:58.933
Gene?

08:05.167 --> 08:06.067
Oh, yeah.

08:09.233 --> 08:11.567
*

08:11.667 --> 08:14.067
Gene!

08:14.133 --> 08:17.100
This isn't funny.

08:17.200 --> 08:21.867
The toxicity levels are high.

08:21.967 --> 08:23.900
Gene.

08:32.367 --> 08:33.867
- Elephant in the room!
Elephant in the room!

08:33.967 --> 08:35.567
Elephant in the room!

08:39.267 --> 08:40.533
- J.C. Christ,
what were you doing?

08:40.633 --> 08:41.833
You scared me.
I thought you were Bane.

08:41.933 --> 08:43.733
- It's my sleep apnea mask,

08:43.833 --> 08:46.500
and it's not even working,
so can we go, like, now?

08:46.600 --> 08:48.167
- No!

08:48.267 --> 08:49.833
- No!

08:49.933 --> 08:51.533
- Gene,
you cannot be in here, okay?

08:51.633 --> 08:52.933
It is dangerous.

08:53.067 --> 08:55.900
- You know what my response
is to that?

08:56.067 --> 08:58.333
Fine. Stay in here.

08:58.433 --> 09:00.133
Great slumber party,
by the way.

09:00.233 --> 09:01.467
It worked out really well.

09:01.567 --> 09:03.167
You'll probably die,
but enjoy.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.567
- Well, it would've
turned out well-er

09:04.667 --> 09:06.800
if you weren't
such a killjoy.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
It's like
you murdered the maid.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.100
You get it? 'Cause Joy's--
- Yeah.

09:10.200 --> 09:11.400
both: The maid.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.500
- Killjoy.

09:12.600 --> 09:14.833
God, do you ever
have any fun?

09:14.933 --> 09:16.400
- Getting out of here.
- Go ahead.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.967
Walk away, Grandma.

09:21.567 --> 09:22.967
- Grand...ma.

09:23.067 --> 09:25.067
Or is your hearing going?

09:25.167 --> 09:26.267
And that's your name,
isn't it?

09:26.367 --> 09:28.100
- You know my name
is just Billie.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.767
- "Oh, hi, I'm Billie.

09:29.867 --> 09:32.633
"I like to do
my Asian newspaper puzzles

09:32.733 --> 09:35.667
and complain about
how good music used to be."

09:35.767 --> 09:36.667
- Stop it.
That's not me.

09:36.767 --> 09:37.967
- "Oh, hi, I'm Billie.

09:38.067 --> 09:39.600
"Ooh, I get the shivers
every time

09:39.700 --> 09:42.333
"someone takes my blanket
off of my wheelchaired legs.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.067
Oh, hi, I'm Billie!"

09:44.100 --> 09:45.267
- Stop introducing me!

09:45.367 --> 09:46.733
- "Hi, I'm Billie,

09:46.833 --> 09:48.133
"or you could just call me
Drew Barrymore,

09:48.233 --> 09:51.067
'cause I ain't never
been kissed."

09:54.567 --> 09:58.100
That was so good
and so mean.

10:01.233 --> 10:02.733
That was my mid back,

10:02.833 --> 10:05.100
which is one
of my most sensitive spots,

10:05.200 --> 10:07.733
and you know that.

10:07.833 --> 10:09.767
- What are you gonna
do with that?

10:09.867 --> 10:12.767
- Take this, you piece of S.

10:12.867 --> 10:14.733
- Stay there.

10:14.833 --> 10:17.033
- You've been coned.

10:19.100 --> 10:20.800
- Grandma!

10:24.867 --> 10:26.900
- Get off of me!

10:27.000 --> 10:28.833
- I don't have a key
for the lock!

10:32.900 --> 10:35.633
My ankle monitor's off.

10:35.733 --> 10:38.167
O.M. gosh, you know what that
means, right? We're going out.

10:38.267 --> 10:39.433
- We have to call
your caseworker.

10:39.533 --> 10:40.567
- We're not going out.

10:40.667 --> 10:42.000
- Billie, please.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.000
I've been stuck in the house
for 20 days now.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.033
- Way longer than that.

10:45.133 --> 10:46.400
- 20 days!

10:46.500 --> 10:48.967
We're going out.

10:49.067 --> 10:50.233
- I'll tell.

10:51.567 --> 10:53.400
- If you leave,
I'll tell.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.233
- Aren't you tired
of killing the fun, Billie?

10:56.333 --> 10:57.533
You're tired of it.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.200
It's Friday night.
- Sunday.

10:59.300 --> 11:01.600
- It's Sunday night,
Billie.

11:01.700 --> 11:05.367
And I may not
be a religious person,

11:05.467 --> 11:09.200
but I believe it was God
who turned my ankle monitor off.

11:09.300 --> 11:10.767
- You're not
from the South.

11:10.867 --> 11:13.100
- There's a reason.

11:13.200 --> 11:18.067
"The reason is you,"
to quote Hoobastank.

11:18.167 --> 11:20.133
This is your chance.

11:20.233 --> 11:23.733
Your chance, Billie,
to prove to everyone

11:23.833 --> 11:25.933
that you're not
that lame little grandma

11:26.067 --> 11:28.200
that Deborah Denise
said that you were.

11:28.300 --> 11:32.233
And to quote someone
in class yesterday,

11:32.333 --> 11:36.267
"She who commands the future
conquers the past."

11:36.367 --> 11:37.733
- I-I didn't say that.

11:37.833 --> 11:39.433
- I don't think so.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.967
- Mm, nope.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.633
- Nope.
You know what?

11:43.733 --> 11:45.767
I ordered Chinese food.
It was on a fortune cookie.

11:45.867 --> 11:47.633
Cookie makes sense though,
right?

11:47.733 --> 11:48.667
- Mm-mm.

11:48.767 --> 11:50.133
- * We're going out

11:50.233 --> 11:52.867
* Yeah, we're going out
to a nightclub *

11:52.967 --> 11:55.700
* You've got
the invite ticket *

11:55.800 --> 11:59.533
- * The one that says RSVP
for the discotheque *

11:59.633 --> 12:01.933
- * That's the one,
that's the very one *

12:02.067 --> 12:05.067
- * With boys and booze
and dance floor styles *

12:05.100 --> 12:08.433
- * Boys get boners
due to your moves *

12:08.533 --> 12:09.667
Let's go to the nightclub.

12:09.767 --> 12:10.900
- Okay. Okay.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.233
- You look like Moira Kelly
from "The Cutting Edge."

12:16.333 --> 12:18.433
- You sure this isn't too,
like, "I'm an ice skater"?

12:18.533 --> 12:20.900
- It is
but in the best way.

12:21.067 --> 12:22.067
Are you crying?

12:22.167 --> 12:23.433
- No, it's the fumes.

12:23.533 --> 12:24.600
They're, like,
really getting to my eyes.

12:24.700 --> 12:25.600
I think we should get
out of here.

12:25.700 --> 12:27.267
- Yeah.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.700
[Weekend Money's
"Pussy Gold" playing]

12:28.800 --> 12:30.700
- * Pretty face,
full figure *

12:30.800 --> 12:32.900
* She stay but go get it,
she ain't a gold-digger *

12:33.067 --> 12:34.767
* But yet she think
her pussy gold *

12:34.867 --> 12:36.267
* Gold

12:36.367 --> 12:39.533
* Her pussy gold, gold

12:41.400 --> 12:43.833
- I ordered an Uber,
like, five minutes ago.

12:43.933 --> 12:45.067
I don't know
where this thing is.

12:45.167 --> 12:46.667
It's, like, a stretch.

12:46.767 --> 12:50.267
Blaine is driving.

12:50.367 --> 12:52.133
So where are you from?

12:52.233 --> 12:53.933
- You know where I'm from.

12:54.067 --> 12:55.067
- I know.
I'm just bored.

12:55.167 --> 12:56.067
- Yeah, me too.

12:56.167 --> 12:57.567
- Excuse me.
- Oh.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.733
- Club girls coming through.

12:59.833 --> 13:04.533
Hello, four shots of literally
whatever...alcoholic.

13:04.633 --> 13:06.133
- Yeah.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.900
What are you having, Billie?

13:08.067 --> 13:09.567
- Brandy Alexander.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.900
- Billie.

13:12.067 --> 13:15.167
I thought we were leaving...

13:15.267 --> 13:17.800
your AARP discount card...

13:17.900 --> 13:18.867
at home tonight.

13:18.967 --> 13:20.567
- That's a lot of alcohol.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.333
- Order a real drink, Billie.
- Okay.

13:22.433 --> 13:25.900
I'll have a vodka cosmopolitan
with an orange slice.

13:26.067 --> 13:27.167
- Come on.
- Okay.

13:27.267 --> 13:30.233
Hold the orange slice.

13:30.333 --> 13:31.900
Okay, fine. I'll just have
what she's having.

13:32.067 --> 13:33.633
- Yes!

13:33.733 --> 13:36.067
- Shots of alcohol.
Cheers.

13:36.100 --> 13:40.567
Let's party.

13:43.933 --> 13:46.067
- This music is super fresh.

13:46.100 --> 13:48.467
- Yeah, it's DJ Doghead.
He's my favorite.

13:53.267 --> 13:55.133
'Cause his head
is a dog head.

13:55.233 --> 13:57.300
- And he's a DJ, so the DJ
and then the dog head.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.967
- I get it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:59.067 --> 14:00.367
Time for a club pic!

14:00.467 --> 14:02.300
- Oh, picture of us
at a nightclub!

14:02.400 --> 14:03.367
- Whoo-hoo!

14:03.467 --> 14:04.800
- Let's do it.

14:04.900 --> 14:05.800
- I'll take it.
- Cool, cool, cool, cool.

14:08.067 --> 14:09.400
Oh, God.
Is that really--

14:09.500 --> 14:11.933
- Oh, my gosh,
is that what we look like?

14:12.067 --> 14:14.067
- We are two fat bitches.

14:14.133 --> 14:15.167
- It's not great.

14:15.267 --> 14:16.267
- Jesus.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.067
I'll get someone to take it.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.467
Hey, pretty boy
with the tail, dovetails.

14:20.567 --> 14:22.700
Can you take this picture?

14:22.800 --> 14:24.700
- Go--can you go a little
further back, so we look good?

14:24.800 --> 14:26.733
- Yeah.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.067
- What the--

14:30.100 --> 14:32.100
- Oh, my God,
he-he just took my phone! Hey!

14:33.633 --> 14:35.600
It's okay.
Look, let me--drink this.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.067
- I know.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.833
But drink it,
and you'll feel better.

14:39.933 --> 14:41.200
Yeah?

14:41.300 --> 14:42.467
- You're right. I feel better.

14:42.567 --> 14:44.267
- Did I always have gum
in my mouth?

14:44.367 --> 14:46.800
*

14:46.900 --> 14:49.300
- DJ Doghead,
I love you.

14:49.400 --> 14:51.300
He pointed at me.
Totally pointed at me.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.933
- Yeah.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.300
What's he doing?

14:55.400 --> 14:57.267
- I think he wants us
to go with him.

14:57.367 --> 14:58.967
, son!

14:59.067 --> 15:00.833
We just got invited
to the dog pound!

15:00.933 --> 15:02.167
- Randy Jackson style.

15:02.267 --> 15:03.400
- Yeah.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.667
It's cool if we have these?

15:05.767 --> 15:06.933
That's awesome.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.833
I'm Gene,
and this is Billie.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.400
- Why don't you
take your head off?

15:10.500 --> 15:12.567
- No, Billie,
he doesn't take his head off.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.400
He's DJ Doghead, okay?

15:14.500 --> 15:15.933
He never takes his head off.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.767
- Ah.
- It's a thing.

15:17.867 --> 15:18.900
- I take it off.

15:19.067 --> 15:19.967
I take it off all the time.

15:20.067 --> 15:21.500
It gets hot in there.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.067
both: Chris Klein?

15:24.167 --> 15:26.600
- Yeah, I've been DJing for,
like, deuce years now.

15:26.700 --> 15:28.567
There's just something
about loud music

15:28.667 --> 15:29.900
and tight spaces,
you know.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.800
I just love it
when the beat drops

15:31.900 --> 15:34.900
and everybody's face is like,
"Whoa, the beat just dropped."

15:35.067 --> 15:36.833
- That is what it's like.
- Yeah, that's what I do.

15:36.933 --> 15:39.800
I'm like, "Whoa!"
Right?

15:39.900 --> 15:41.467
- That must be so fresh.

15:41.567 --> 15:45.667
- Oh, on a fresh level,
it is the froshest.

15:45.767 --> 15:48.233
- You should be New Chet.
- Gene.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.233
- Oh,
Chet's my dead best friend.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.833
You don't look
like him or anything,

15:54.933 --> 15:57.133
but he was cool,
and you're cool too.

15:57.233 --> 15:58.933
So you're New Chet.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.367
Don't die.

16:01.467 --> 16:05.367
- What you said made zero sense,
but I love a nickname.

16:05.467 --> 16:07.133
I'll totally be New Chet!

16:07.233 --> 16:08.667
- Yes!
- Yeah!

16:08.767 --> 16:09.967
- DJ Dog Chet.

16:10.067 --> 16:12.633
both: DJ Dog Chet.
- Whoo!

16:12.733 --> 16:14.233
- It's the same syllables.

16:14.333 --> 16:15.467
- * We rock and rollers

16:15.567 --> 16:17.633
all: Whoo!

16:17.733 --> 16:19.267
- * Them Lamborghini doors up

16:19.367 --> 16:22.467
*

16:22.567 --> 16:26.100
* We be at the party with
them Lamborghini doors up *

16:26.200 --> 16:29.467
* Hopping up and down,
what you know about that? *

16:29.567 --> 16:31.267
* Ha ha

16:31.367 --> 16:33.233
- Yeah!

16:33.333 --> 16:36.367
- Ghost pussy.

16:36.467 --> 16:38.133
- That's what God looks like
when he eats clouds.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.133
- Hey, God,
what you doing in a nightclub?

16:42.233 --> 16:44.233
- He's having a good time.
- God, you in the nightclub.

16:44.333 --> 16:45.733
- Just having a good time,
Billie.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.433
- Whoo!

16:47.533 --> 16:49.600
Take that.
We got to go.

16:49.700 --> 16:50.733
No!

16:50.833 --> 16:52.400
Chris Klein
is getting us drinks.

16:52.500 --> 16:54.600
- I said we have to go, Gene.
- No.

16:54.700 --> 16:56.633
This is, like,
the best night of my life!

16:56.733 --> 16:59.567
I was even thinking
about chanting that later.

16:59.667 --> 17:01.167
- Deborah Denise is here.

17:01.267 --> 17:02.433
I can't hear you.

17:02.533 --> 17:04.467
It's too loud.
- I said...

17:04.567 --> 17:08.700
Deborah Denise is here!

17:08.800 --> 17:12.667
- I think she heard you.

17:12.767 --> 17:13.833
- We can still
get out of here.

17:13.933 --> 17:14.833
- No, Billie,
you have to face this.

17:14.933 --> 17:16.433
- I can't feel my feet!

17:16.533 --> 17:18.133
- That's 'cause
you have really high shoes on.

17:18.233 --> 17:20.233
- You just want to stay here
because you're having fun!

17:20.333 --> 17:22.500
- No, that is not it.
- It is so it.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.667
- Okay, it's, like, 80% of it,
okay, but the other 30% is that

17:25.767 --> 17:27.167
I want you to deal with this.
I think she just walked up.

17:27.267 --> 17:28.400
- She's right here.
She's looking at me.

17:28.500 --> 17:29.933
- I think
she's just right there.

17:30.067 --> 17:32.967
Walk up to her, and just say
something cool and bitchy.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.467
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:34.567 --> 17:35.467
- She can hear everything
we're saying.

17:35.567 --> 17:37.467
- Get it.
- Got it.

17:37.567 --> 17:40.233
Hey, there.
- Nope.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.367
- Grandma Billie,
is that you?

17:43.467 --> 17:45.500
What are you doing here?

17:45.600 --> 17:48.367
Shouldn't a nurse be lowering
you into an Epsom salt bath?

17:48.467 --> 17:53.233
- Yeah. Yes, if by "a nurse,"
you mean a hot dude,

17:53.333 --> 17:54.733
and by "Epsom salt bath,"

17:54.833 --> 17:57.500
you mean a really big
Epsom salt bath.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.967
Oh!

17:59.067 --> 18:01.067
- Nice comeback,
Betty White.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.533
- Oh, more like
Betty What?

18:03.633 --> 18:06.200
'Cause you're not even
cool to me anymore.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.967
- Pfft.
Got her.

18:08.067 --> 18:09.700
Got her in the club.

18:09.800 --> 18:12.067
Nailed her.
Not in the good way.

18:13.333 --> 18:14.700
- She's--what she's saying

18:14.800 --> 18:16.767
is you look like old Barbie doll
doo

18:18.733 --> 18:21.700
- Okay, well,
you look like ice-capade puke.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.767
- Ladies, brought us
some Klein coolers.

18:24.867 --> 18:26.533
Well,
they're just wine coolers,

18:26.633 --> 18:28.533
but I bought 'em,
so technically, that's right.

18:28.633 --> 18:31.567
- No, this is not the time,
New Chet, okay?

18:31.667 --> 18:33.400
We're in the middle
of a catfight.

18:33.500 --> 18:38.133
- Well,
then let the dog handle it.

18:38.233 --> 18:42.133
Dance off!

18:42.233 --> 18:46.133
In this corner...

18:46.233 --> 18:48.967
Oh.

18:49.067 --> 18:52.067
- Yeah!

18:52.133 --> 18:54.133
- Oh, my God, Billie.

18:54.233 --> 18:56.200
That was so fresh,
it was unreal.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.533
- She fell like John Travolta
in "Saturday Night Fever."

18:59.633 --> 19:01.200
- To John Travolta!

19:01.300 --> 19:02.867
- Travolta!

19:04.600 --> 19:06.833
- Whoo!

19:06.933 --> 19:08.467
- Whoo!

19:08.567 --> 19:10.267
Whoo!

19:10.367 --> 19:15.067
*

19:15.133 --> 19:17.167
Ahh...

19:17.267 --> 19:18.700
- Klein,
you look like Maleficent.

19:20.233 --> 19:22.433
- You do.
- From the movie "Maleficent."

19:22.533 --> 19:24.433
- Ohh!

19:24.533 --> 19:28.200
*

19:28.300 --> 19:30.233
- Ooh!

19:33.767 --> 19:35.067
That's my phone.

19:35.133 --> 19:37.833
*

19:37.933 --> 19:38.867
Not even looking.

19:38.967 --> 19:39.867
- Oh!

19:39.967 --> 19:41.133
- Ah!

19:41.233 --> 19:42.333
Got it.

19:42.433 --> 19:45.700
Up, up!

19:45.800 --> 19:47.533
- Ahh!

19:47.633 --> 19:49.367
*

19:49.467 --> 19:52.700
Best night of my life!
Best night of my life!

19:52.800 --> 19:56.400
Oh! Oh!

19:56.500 --> 19:58.700
Yeah.

19:58.800 --> 20:06.700
*

20:10.500 --> 20:14.167
- Shoe.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.867
- Yeah, I'm up
by the Russell house.

20:16.967 --> 20:18.667
- Ahh!

20:18.767 --> 20:20.600
- Yeah, you're gonna want
to send an ambulance this time.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.733
They look really bath-salty.

20:23.833 --> 20:25.867
- Ta-ta-gow-tow-tow.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.833
- Hush, Muffins.

20:27.933 --> 20:28.900
Hush.

20:30.967 --> 20:35.200
- Dr. Kravitz,
a visitor in the main lobby.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.700
- Well, we're sharing a room.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.933
It's kind of
like a slumber party.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.000
- This isn't funny, Gene.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.167
We could've died.

20:48.533 --> 20:49.600
- Dare.

20:49.700 --> 20:52.967
- Dare you to...
burn your closet.

20:53.067 --> 20:54.567
Or cut yourself.
Cut yourself.

20:54.667 --> 20:57.433
Or eat a tube of toothpaste.

20:57.533 --> 20:58.800
- I'd eat a little bite.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.467
- Nurse,
can we get a toothpaste?

21:00.567 --> 21:02.367
- Yeah,
that actually sounds good.

21:03.600 --> 21:04.800
- Original mint.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.500
- Original mint!

21:17.800 --> 21:20.200
*

21:20.300 --> 21:22.067
- Up, up, up!

21:24.933 --> 21:26.800
- Hit it. Hit it.
- Ah!

21:26.900 --> 21:27.400
- Hit it. Hit it.
