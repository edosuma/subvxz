WEBVTT

00:52.009 --> 00:54.387
You'll like this. I guarantee it.

00:54.512 --> 00:56.347
Yes!

00:56.472 --> 00:58.307
Oh, Abe, I love this.

00:58.432 --> 01:01.310
Well, you loved it
when you picked it out.

01:01.435 --> 01:04.480
- OK, open yours.
- I will.

01:22.832 --> 01:24.709
- Did you know?
- No.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.712
- He didn't tell you?
- No! I swear to God.

01:27.837 --> 01:33.009
Like father, like son.
The two of you are from the same mould.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.598
Happy anniversary.

01:38.848 --> 01:41.017
Happy anniversary.

01:44.103 --> 01:46.647
Are you OK?

01:46.772 --> 01:53.070
- You were tossing and turning all night.
- I know. I don't know what this is.

01:53.196 --> 01:56.407
Come on. Let's go get some breakfast.

01:57.450 --> 02:00.620
- Danny, are you hungry?
- Yeah, sure.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.372
Come on. Let's get something to eat.

02:39.283 --> 02:43.287
Danny, if you're gonna
play with your food,

02:43.913 --> 02:47.375
at least you've gotta have fun doing it.

02:48.751 --> 02:51.212
There. How's that?

02:55.716 --> 02:59.053
- Are you OK, buddy?
- I don't feel so good.

03:07.019 --> 03:09.981
Honey, are you all right?

03:17.363 --> 03:20.074
Come on, let's get out of here.

03:32.253 --> 03:35.089
Can I get some help over here?
Just relax. Sit down.

03:35.214 --> 03:37.008
Here, let me help.

04:26.682 --> 04:29.143
I'm so sorry.

05:59.358 --> 06:01.569
It's the whys that are killing me.

06:01.694 --> 06:07.325
Why were we in that restaurant
on that day at that hour?

06:07.867 --> 06:12.747
Why did that lunatic get it into his
head to kill my wife and my son?

06:13.873 --> 06:17.668
Why not kill me, too?
I mean, he leaves me behind?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.963
Why?

06:25.051 --> 06:27.512
It's just so...

06:27.637 --> 06:29.222
random.

06:48.824 --> 06:51.202
Nice job.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.704
I'm the king.

06:55.414 --> 06:57.959
- Here, Dad's gonna catch you.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.045
- You better throw far.
- Don't kill me.

07:01.170 --> 07:03.214
What could go wrong?

07:03.339 --> 07:05.007
Careful.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.135
I see you.

07:10.471 --> 07:11.806
My dad taught me to swim.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.892
Would you consider Dad
tall or short? Very short?

07:15.017 --> 07:19.522
We short people have thick skin cos it
doesn't get stretched over a tall frame.

07:23.484 --> 07:27.029
The reason my wife and son
were murdered...

07:28.114 --> 07:31.033
was because of me.

07:33.369 --> 07:37.707
Because I wasn't able to help them
when they needed me most.

07:40.918 --> 07:43.421
Happy anniversary.

07:43.546 --> 07:45.590
I should've saved them.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.468
I should've saved them.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.637
Slow motion.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.266
Yes!

07:55.391 --> 07:57.727
The winner. The winner!

08:27.381 --> 08:30.092
I know this is upsetting,

08:30.218 --> 08:33.679
but I have to be with my wife and son.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.431
Goodbye.

08:37.265 --> 08:42.355
Christ, Abe, don't do anything foolish,
all right? I'm coming right over.

08:45.816 --> 08:48.402
- Is this our OD?
- Yeah.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.447
- You know how many of these he took?
- I don't know, man.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.534
Get him on an IV.
Start him on normal saline.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.286
Pulse rate 47 and dropping.

08:57.411 --> 08:59.580
- Putting a line in.
- He's crashing.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.667
Give him atropine. Saline wide open.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.294
- Give him the full amp.
- We're losing him.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.463
- Asystole.
- Checking respirations.

09:07.588 --> 09:10.299
Starting CPR. Come on.

09:10.424 --> 09:13.594
- He's dying.
- Come on.

09:13.719 --> 09:17.223
- He's still in V-fib.
- No pulse.

09:19.475 --> 09:25.690
- Did you give him the full amp?
- Yes. He's not responding.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.530
Come back to us. Continue compressions.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.866
No response. Do you wanna call it?

10:16.991 --> 10:19.577
Could be fine V-fib.
Give me the paddles.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.623
Charge to 200.

10:23.748 --> 10:25.708
Charged to 200.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.376
Clear.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.224
- 300.
- 300.

10:41.349 --> 10:43.559
Clear.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.110
360. Clear.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.913
- 360.
- 360.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.373
Clear.

11:24.851 --> 11:30.106
- We've got a sinus rhythm.
- Pressure's climbing.

11:30.231 --> 11:32.441
We're getting a response.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.738
It's OK. We brought you back.

11:38.406 --> 11:41.325
Check his oxygen saturation.

11:41.450 --> 11:44.912
Oxygen saturation is good.

11:45.037 --> 11:48.082
Blood pressure is 140 over 60.

12:04.932 --> 12:07.351
Hi. You're awake.

12:09.312 --> 12:13.065
I'm Sherry Clarke.
You're in Saint Elizabeth's ICU.

12:13.191 --> 12:16.986
- Are you my doctor?
- Better. I'm your nurse.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.575
The light hurts my eyes.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.754
- How long have I been here?
- A couple of days.

12:34.879 --> 12:40.885
Dr Karras has been keeping an eye
on you. You're his latest project.

12:41.469 --> 12:44.180
Do you wanna watch some TV?

12:46.766 --> 12:49.352
- Anything in particular?
- No.

12:50.770 --> 12:55.733
Oh, dude, you lucked out.
This is my favourite movie of all time.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.993
We belong dead.

13:47.201 --> 13:52.707
Hello, Abe. I'm Dr Karras.
I'm just gonna have a little look.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.793
- Are you OK?
- I've been better.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.045
Remember why you're here?

13:58.171 --> 14:02.550
You were legally dead, but, lucky for
you, modern medicine knows no limits.

14:02.675 --> 14:07.430
- I died?
- Technically speaking. You had an NDE.

14:07.555 --> 14:10.808
- I don't know what that is.
- Near-death experience.

14:10.933 --> 14:15.897
It's my field of expertise. I fought to make
sure you were my patient. Let me guess.

14:16.022 --> 14:21.694
You saw a white light that engulfed you,
almost seemed to beckon you to stay.

14:21.819 --> 14:24.739
Yeah, that's exact...
How did you know that?

14:24.864 --> 14:30.161
As many as eight out of ten people who've
had an NDE report seeing a white light.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.247
- Freaky, huh?
- What about the light I'm seeing now?

14:33.372 --> 14:38.377
- It's probably an aura, a type
of residue. - So it's normal?

14:38.503 --> 14:42.381
I'd say we're well beyond
the bounds of normal here, but yes.

14:42.507 --> 14:48.721
You'll see 'em less frequently as time
passes and eventually they'll disappear.

16:44.253 --> 16:47.298
She's with us.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.384
She's with us.

16:50.635 --> 16:53.763
She's with us.

16:58.643 --> 17:00.937
So everything looks fine.

17:02.188 --> 17:05.650
No masses, no deviations
in your intracranial space.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.653
But I've seen it three times
in the past few days.

17:08.778 --> 17:10.946
- Seen what?
- The white light.

17:11.071 --> 17:16.243
And there's something else. You're
gonna think I'm crazy, but, um...

17:17.036 --> 17:20.832
I'm seeing and hearing
all kinds of electrical stuff.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.420
EVP stands for
electronic voice phenomena.

17:26.546 --> 17:31.801
Precognition, the light you're seeing, all
that is part of supernatural white noise.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.638
- I've got a grant to study these
things. - So EVP, what exactly is it?

17:35.763 --> 17:41.269
It's the recording of the deceased using
a detuned apparatus like a TV or radio.

17:41.394 --> 17:45.231
Some people believe that EVP is the
afterlife manifest all around us.

17:45.356 --> 17:48.609
Others think it's a charge
or electromagnetic fields,

17:48.734 --> 17:53.531
still others that it's a means through
which the dead can communicate with us.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.201
Frankly, who knows? As long as
we're not exactly sure what it is,

17:57.326 --> 18:00.329
they'll keep funding my grant.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.967
What are you doing down here?

18:14.802 --> 18:18.097
This... is my EVP room.

18:18.598 --> 18:23.895
These have been detuned and I record 'em
to see if I've captured any transmissions.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.982
I suppose that's an important part
of your work, then?

18:28.107 --> 18:31.277
That? Oh.
No, I didn't want to detune that one.

18:31.402 --> 18:36.616
That's Change of Habit.
I'm recording it for research purposes.

18:36.741 --> 18:41.370
I thought I might learn something
from Dr Presley.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.624
- You're not a fan of this one?
- No, it's just...

18:44.749 --> 18:48.002
I just saw one of those things
on the screen.

18:49.128 --> 18:52.632
Transmissions are only visible
after they've been recorded.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.051
On the last close-up of Elvis,

18:55.176 --> 19:00.723
I saw a blast of static with
what looked like an unformed person.

19:07.355 --> 19:12.276
- So what are you doing now?
- I've rewound the feed, I'll detune it.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.446
Let's see if you really saw something.

19:24.080 --> 19:27.333
There. There, that's it. That's it.

19:27.458 --> 19:30.837
That was it. That's what I saw.

19:36.050 --> 19:39.637
- I'll be damned.
- So what does that mean?

19:39.762 --> 19:44.767
Maybe when you had your NDE,
you yourself became a detuned receiver.

19:44.892 --> 19:51.107
You see white-noise transmissions, EVP,
communications with the dead, all that,

19:51.232 --> 19:53.276
without any of this.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.904
You're in uncharted territory.

19:57.029 --> 20:01.284
There's a very good chance you're
going to be seeing some wacky stuff.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.706
I've got to go.
I've got a doctor's appointment.

20:06.831 --> 20:10.877
Sure. Take all the time you need.
Hey, I'm still saving all the clippings

20:11.002 --> 20:13.546
and articles about
the shooting and stuff.

20:13.671 --> 20:17.884
I don't want to hear about the day my
wife and son were brutally murdered, OK?

20:18.009 --> 20:21.053
I just can't handle that right now. I...

20:22.680 --> 20:23.764
I refuse.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.688
Hi. Dr Karras asked...

20:31.480 --> 20:33.524
What's wrong?

20:33.649 --> 20:36.194
Dr Karras is dead.

20:37.153 --> 20:40.615
- What? - He had a heart
attack early this morning.

20:48.289 --> 20:50.166
I'm sorry.

21:10.061 --> 21:12.980
- OK, so this...
- EVP.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.691
EVP.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.528
It draws your attention
to the white light.

21:18.653 --> 21:22.657
When you see the light, you think
it means... What do you think it means?

21:22.782 --> 21:27.453
That somebody's gonna die. Like with
Dr Karras, it could be a couple of days.

21:27.578 --> 21:33.334
With the woman, it could be hours, just
depending on how strong the light is.

21:33.459 --> 21:38.422
I don't know, but I'm seeing it more and
it's driving me nuts. It's like being God.

21:38.548 --> 21:42.844
- I'm worried about you, Abe.
- Well, how would you explain it, then?

21:42.969 --> 21:45.638
How about, "I don't know"?

21:45.763 --> 21:50.017
In a city, we probably cross paths with
people who are about to die all the time.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.854
- We just don't know it.
- But what if I do, Marty?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.189
What if I do know
when somebody will die?

21:55.314 --> 21:59.777
- And now you've got this superpower?
- It's not a superpower.

22:00.403 --> 22:06.242
Call it what you want, but that sure as
hell sounds like superhero bullshit to me.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.661
Stop talking all this nonsense.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.433
Come on, you stupid thing.

23:55.852 --> 23:57.895
Get over the track.

24:03.234 --> 24:07.405
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
- Come on!

24:07.530 --> 24:09.782
Hey!

24:09.907 --> 24:12.034
You've gotta move!

24:14.120 --> 24:16.080
Come on!

24:16.205 --> 24:18.457
Get out of there!

24:27.216 --> 24:28.426
Move!

24:33.639 --> 24:34.724
Hey!

24:36.142 --> 24:40.771
- Get outta there!
- I can't! My foot's caught! Help me!

24:42.815 --> 24:44.859
Help me!

24:44.984 --> 24:47.403
Get off the track!

24:51.199 --> 24:53.075
Move!

25:31.572 --> 25:34.200
I'm so sorry.

28:45.766 --> 28:50.021
- Yeah?
- How'd you feel about me dropping by?

28:50.146 --> 28:53.441
Abe, uh...
Yeah, sure. When?

28:53.566 --> 28:56.235
How does right freaking now grab you?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.404
Thanks.

29:06.204 --> 29:08.289
What the?

29:10.500 --> 29:12.710
No way.

29:16.631 --> 29:18.799
Son of a bitch.

29:33.523 --> 29:35.691
Excuse me, sir

29:36.526 --> 29:38.444
- Dammit.
- You should get out.

29:38.569 --> 29:43.241
Beat it, kid. I've dropped a couple
of lug nuts. I think I can handle it.

29:47.912 --> 29:50.164
I don't think that bumper is gonna hold.

29:50.289 --> 29:54.335
Look, I don't need some dipshit kid
telling me what to do, OK?

29:54.460 --> 30:00.132
So you can take your metrosexual ass
back to your yuppie car and...

30:01.259 --> 30:02.885
- Whoa!
- What are you doing?

30:03.010 --> 30:06.305
- The bumper was gonna...
- Get away from me.

30:25.283 --> 30:28.286
I owe you my life.

30:44.635 --> 30:47.847
No, Marty, I swear to God, I am fine.

30:47.972 --> 30:50.683
All right. All right,
but maybe you should...

30:50.808 --> 30:54.103
I don't know, take a little time off
or something, you know.

30:54.228 --> 30:59.150
- I don't want you overdoing it.
- All right. I'll think about it. Thanks.

31:21.130 --> 31:24.050
You saved somebody's life tonight.

31:38.606 --> 31:42.193
- Would you consider Dad tall?
- No, no, short.

31:42.318 --> 31:44.028
Very short?

31:44.153 --> 31:47.323
- No offence.
- We short people have thick skin

31:47.448 --> 31:49.992
cos it doesn't get stretched
over a tall frame.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.911
Yeah. True.

31:52.036 --> 31:58.251
There's the Austrian coach. Looks like
she's trying to throw him. Ha! Nice job!

32:44.964 --> 32:46.632
Shit!

32:51.512 --> 32:55.516
- Two weeks? That's so far.
- I know.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.311
- I'll have to come.
- Yeah.

33:01.105 --> 33:04.775
Ugh! OK. Three-martini lunches,
here I come.

33:06.277 --> 33:09.489
I'll be right there
to put the easy into listening.

33:11.616 --> 33:16.662
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

33:18.998 --> 33:22.710
- Don't worry. You can make it
up to me. - Just take it easy.

33:22.835 --> 33:26.881
I might even let you pick up overtime
in my hotel room, you know what I mean?

33:27.006 --> 33:29.842
- Hey, come on.
- Just leave it.

33:29.967 --> 33:32.470
All right, that's enough.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.640
- Stop it!
- Get him!

33:35.765 --> 33:39.977
Stop it, you're hurting him!
Stop it, you're hurting him!

33:47.026 --> 33:48.903
Hey! Hey!

33:49.987 --> 33:52.949
- Hey!
- Shit! Guys, guys!

33:53.074 --> 33:55.076
Hey!

33:59.497 --> 34:02.917
- Help! Help!
- Let's go.

34:03.042 --> 34:05.127
I'm slipping!

34:05.253 --> 34:07.755
Please, pull me up.

34:07.880 --> 34:10.299
Pull me up!

34:19.976 --> 34:22.186
Are you OK?

34:28.609 --> 34:30.777
Yeah, he's gonna be fine.

34:31.821 --> 34:34.157
Me, I'm not so sure about.

34:49.088 --> 34:53.759
Abe, I missed you at work today. I
guess you decided to take that time off.

34:53.885 --> 34:57.180
Give me a call when you get a chance,
all right? Later.

34:57.305 --> 35:00.349
Playing God for another day.

35:13.821 --> 35:15.531
- Hello?
- Hey, Marty.

35:15.656 --> 35:19.202
I'm on my way to the hospital
to check on that kid I helped earlier.

35:19.327 --> 35:21.996
- Would you meet me there?
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

35:22.121 --> 35:24.373
Great. And...

35:25.875 --> 35:28.711
that stuff you're holding for me,

35:28.836 --> 35:31.172
will you bring it?

35:31.297 --> 35:33.257
I'm ready.

35:33.382 --> 35:35.927
- OK, sure.
- Thanks.

35:42.558 --> 35:45.019
Hey.

35:45.144 --> 35:46.354
Hey.

35:46.479 --> 35:51.150
- Thank you very much for meeting me.
- No problem, man.

35:51.275 --> 35:54.320
There are things in here
that are gonna reopen wounds.

35:54.445 --> 35:56.864
- Are you sure you're ready?
- I'm positive.

35:56.989 --> 35:59.575
- OK.
- Thanks.

35:59.700 --> 36:03.412
- Hey, call me if you need anything.
- I will.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.128
Hey there.

36:11.254 --> 36:15.132
- Oh, hey. Mr Dale. - I was
checking to see how Kurt's doing.

36:15.258 --> 36:17.593
Needed stitches, a few scrapes, bruises,

36:17.718 --> 36:22.014
and we're doing a keep overnight
to make sure there's no concussion...

36:22.139 --> 36:24.976
...but he should be fine.

36:27.562 --> 36:29.564
Thanks.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.967
Oh, come on.

38:47.493 --> 38:49.871
Not a word.

39:10.057 --> 39:12.310
You bitch!

39:52.183 --> 39:55.520
Hey. Hey, are you OK?

39:55.645 --> 39:57.313
Yeah.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.774
Yeah.

39:59.899 --> 40:03.069
I think you just saved my life.

40:05.029 --> 40:10.868
Well, it's beginning to be a fucking
habit. Trust me, it's no big deal.

40:10.993 --> 40:15.706
- Dude, it was my life.
- Well, I didn't mean it like that.

40:16.999 --> 40:19.585
It's you.

40:19.710 --> 40:22.672
Yeah. Yeah, you were my nurse.

40:33.808 --> 40:36.519
It's busted.

40:38.229 --> 40:40.731
I'm so sorry.

40:43.151 --> 40:45.403
That's OK.

40:45.528 --> 40:47.613
- You're hurt. Let me look.
- It's fine.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.782
Hey.

40:51.284 --> 40:55.163
Let me fix you up.
It's the least I can do. Come on.

40:56.831 --> 41:02.545
It's a superficial laceration. Nothing a few
stitches and antibiotics can't take care of.

41:02.670 --> 41:07.842
You are either staring at my ring
or admiring my rack. Which is it?

41:07.967 --> 41:11.596
- The ring. I was...
- I'm just kidding.

41:12.555 --> 41:15.892
It's my old wedding ring.
My husband died a couple of years ago

41:16.017 --> 41:19.437
so I like to keep it close to my heart.

41:20.605 --> 41:23.441
You must have loved him very much.

41:24.525 --> 41:25.860
Yeah.

41:26.986 --> 41:31.616
He was a music teacher
at Sacred Heart Elementary,

41:31.741 --> 41:34.202
and those kids adored him.

41:34.327 --> 41:38.998
He had a unique approach. No doh-ray-mi
crap. He'd organise this recital every year,

41:39.123 --> 41:43.377
have the kids sing Bowie, Pink Floyd,
Rush, The Beach Boys, Jane's Addiction.

41:43.503 --> 41:47.757
- You name it.
- Sounds amazing.

41:47.882 --> 41:51.469
Yeah. It was incredible.

41:51.594 --> 41:55.848
But the end just... It came so quick.

41:57.350 --> 42:00.770
One day we're just living, you know?

42:01.437 --> 42:05.233
Then, boom, he's dead.

42:06.275 --> 42:08.736
That's terrible.

42:08.861 --> 42:10.696
Yeah.

42:11.739 --> 42:13.950
But...

42:14.075 --> 42:16.494
I wake up

42:16.619 --> 42:18.704
and it just hit me.

42:18.830 --> 42:22.500
I had to let Tommy go.

42:23.417 --> 42:27.046
I'll see him again someday. Until then,

42:27.171 --> 42:30.466
you have to accept
what it's supposed to be about.

42:35.263 --> 42:38.391
- Did you two have any kids?
- No.

42:38.516 --> 42:42.228
No. But I still put on the recital
every year in his honour.

42:42.353 --> 42:44.814
The next one's in a couple of days.

42:46.440 --> 42:50.111
- And you should totally come.
- Maybe.

42:53.114 --> 42:55.950
Here.

42:57.660 --> 43:00.329
Take this. Think it over.

43:00.454 --> 43:03.332
Call me if you're interested.

43:03.833 --> 43:06.419
Hey, the cops are here.

43:06.544 --> 43:09.589
Yeah. Tell them their timing sucks.

43:32.987 --> 43:37.366
Is this the present you got Dad for
your anniversary? Can I see it? Can I?

43:37.492 --> 43:40.244
I don't suppose your dad
put you up to this, did he?

43:40.369 --> 43:44.749
No way. Just wondering is all.
I bet it's that watch he wanted, right?

43:44.874 --> 43:47.627
You tell your dad
that he's just gonna have to wait.

43:47.752 --> 43:50.171
Besides, it's just a few days away.

43:55.927 --> 43:59.931
- Are you all right? - I'm OK,
Mom. That man saved our lives.

44:00.056 --> 44:02.850
Thank you!

44:02.975 --> 44:05.811
That's all right.

44:21.369 --> 44:23.704
That's all right.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.294
Henry Caine.

45:58.966 --> 46:03.179
Should not have saved.
Should not have saved.

46:03.304 --> 46:07.600
Should not have saved.
Should not have saved.

46:07.725 --> 46:11.187
Should not...

46:11.312 --> 46:14.982
have saved.

47:01.279 --> 47:05.700
- Julia Caine? My name is Abraham...
- Abraham Dale.

47:05.825 --> 47:09.078
I always knew you'd come.
Please, come on in.

47:09.203 --> 47:12.248
Excuse the mess. We're moving.

47:34.562 --> 47:38.399
I am so sorry for what my husband did
to your wife and son.

47:38.524 --> 47:44.113
Henry was the most down-to-earth, don't-
question-things guy you could ever meet.

47:44.238 --> 47:46.365
So, uh...

47:48.242 --> 47:50.786
so what happened, then?

47:50.912 --> 47:53.539
He, uh...

47:53.664 --> 47:56.125
he had a near-death experience.

47:57.376 --> 47:59.712
He was hit by a drunk driver head-on.

47:59.837 --> 48:04.425
He must have died three times that night.
They finally revived him in the early hours

48:04.550 --> 48:08.054
and then we brought him home
a week later.

48:08.179 --> 48:10.223
That's when it all began -

48:10.348 --> 48:15.436
the strange behaviour, the weird
ideas about life, about death.

48:15.561 --> 48:18.314
He just got so obsessed
with the paranormal.

48:18.439 --> 48:23.903
EVP, the white light,
precognition, all that kind of stuff.

48:24.028 --> 48:27.281
He even thought he could save people.

48:28.407 --> 48:31.994
At first I thought it was
understandable. This man almost died.

48:32.119 --> 48:36.249
But then it just got to be too much.

48:36.374 --> 48:38.459
What do you mean by too much?

48:42.964 --> 48:45.716
I'll show you.

49:08.906 --> 49:11.784
You see? I'll leave you to it.

52:11.380 --> 52:14.217
Oh, shit!

52:41.744 --> 52:44.664
Henry was always blowing fuses in here.

52:44.789 --> 52:47.750
Really? Hm.

52:47.875 --> 52:49.794
Um...

52:51.003 --> 52:54.465
Do you have any idea
what the e stands for?

52:54.590 --> 52:55.758
No.

52:57.260 --> 53:00.429
Would you mind if I took
some of this stuff to look over?

53:00.555 --> 53:03.015
Sure. I don't want any of it.

53:04.433 --> 53:08.563
Look, I am sorry again
for what my husband did.

53:08.688 --> 53:11.607
I can't believe how far gone he is.

53:11.732 --> 53:15.236
- "Is"? What are you talking about?
- What do you mean?

53:15.361 --> 53:18.489
- You said "is".
- And?

53:18.614 --> 53:22.160
Don't you mean "was"?
"How far gone he was"?

53:22.285 --> 53:24.328
You don't know?

53:28.583 --> 53:33.713
- Henry's still alive.
- I saw him pull the trigger.

53:33.838 --> 53:36.841
He survived.
He's over at Belmont County.

53:36.966 --> 53:39.010
The asylum.

53:49.604 --> 53:52.607
We keep him up here.
He's been with us a couple of months,

53:52.732 --> 53:55.234
since he slipped out of coma land.

53:55.359 --> 53:58.446
If you ask me,
he ain't never gonna see a courtroom.

53:58.571 --> 53:59.864
Why?

53:59.989 --> 54:02.783
Old Henry...

54:02.909 --> 54:05.536
he sees dead people.

54:15.963 --> 54:22.178
Don't mind me. I'm just gonna stick
around and make sure you boys play nice.

54:26.766 --> 54:29.227
My wife and my son.

54:31.562 --> 54:33.898
Why did you do it?

54:34.023 --> 54:36.984
Why did you kill them?

54:39.195 --> 54:42.532
If save, must kill.

54:43.825 --> 54:46.828
Jesus, you're even crazier
than I thought you'd be.

54:46.953 --> 54:48.996
If save,

54:50.081 --> 54:52.792
responsible.

54:52.917 --> 54:55.628
Responsible for what?

54:56.671 --> 54:59.215
Consequences.

54:59.340 --> 55:01.676
Horrific consequences.

55:02.176 --> 55:04.262
What consequences?

55:26.159 --> 55:30.037
It will never end if you let him in.

55:33.416 --> 55:37.044
You cannot shut the dead out.

55:37.170 --> 55:41.507
The dead will haunt you
until you put right what you've done.

55:42.175 --> 55:45.011
If you save, you must...

55:45.136 --> 55:47.763
you must kill.

55:48.973 --> 55:51.475
Tria Mera.

55:53.936 --> 55:55.730
Tria Mera.

55:56.981 --> 55:59.775
- Trio what?
- Tria Mera!

56:14.957 --> 56:17.084
If save, must kill.

56:35.061 --> 56:38.022
If save, must kill.

56:38.272 --> 56:43.069
If save, must kill. If save, must kill!

57:48.217 --> 57:51.095
It's a three.

57:51.220 --> 57:55.516
What does a three
have to do with the devil's signature?

58:06.736 --> 58:09.155
- Hi, Abe.
- Hi.

58:09.280 --> 58:14.076
So I just finished the rehearsals for that
recital thingy I was telling you about,

58:14.202 --> 58:17.663
so I was basically in the neighbourhood,

58:17.788 --> 58:19.081
and, uh...

58:19.207 --> 58:21.501
Hi.

58:21.626 --> 58:25.379
- I hope you don't mind that
I stopped by. - No, no. I don't...

58:25.505 --> 58:27.548
I don't mind. Um...

58:28.633 --> 58:31.177
But why?

58:31.302 --> 58:33.346
When...

58:34.555 --> 58:37.141
is the last time you drank
a cheap bottle of wine?

58:37.266 --> 58:40.520
That's very kind,
but you really don't have to do that.

58:40.645 --> 58:42.897
I know I don't have to.

58:43.022 --> 58:45.024
I want to.

58:45.149 --> 58:47.068
I'm married.

58:49.111 --> 58:51.656
But thank you.

58:53.366 --> 58:56.494
Abe, I read your file.

58:57.203 --> 58:59.789
I know why you were in the ICU
when we first met.

58:59.914 --> 59:03.543
I know what happened
to Rebecca and Danny.

59:04.460 --> 59:07.463
You saved my life the other night.

59:08.047 --> 59:10.842
I'd love to return the favour.

59:55.386 --> 59:58.890
- I like the hair colour.
- Purple was good, but...

59:59.015 --> 01:00:02.393
- It goes with the wine.
- Right.

01:00:02.518 --> 01:00:04.937
This is great. It really is.

01:00:05.062 --> 01:00:07.356
Thank you very much.

01:00:08.441 --> 01:00:11.569
- To bad wine and good company.
- Oh, it's bad.

01:00:16.991 --> 01:00:19.535
You gotta get out
and do stuff like this, though.

01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:22.747
It's the only way
you'll make it through.

01:00:27.376 --> 01:00:30.505
Danny and Rebecca were my everything.

01:00:32.089 --> 01:00:34.467
And Tommy was mine.

01:00:35.718 --> 01:00:38.513
But you can't just throw
in the towel, Abe.

01:00:50.858 --> 01:00:53.277
- Come on.
- Where are we going?

01:00:53.402 --> 01:00:54.904
O'Malley's.

01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:59.826
I gotta kick your ass in a game of pool
to get back the 2.50 I spent on the wine.

01:00:59.951 --> 01:01:02.161
2.50?

01:01:03.079 --> 01:01:04.163
You got ripped off.

01:01:08.376 --> 01:01:10.753
Eight ball, corner pocket.

01:01:16.926 --> 01:01:18.177
OK.

01:01:18.302 --> 01:01:20.763
How about double or nothing?

01:01:21.848 --> 01:01:23.891
All right.

01:01:26.352 --> 01:01:28.896
Rack 'em up, big boy.

01:01:50.543 --> 01:01:52.253
- Sorry.
- No, it's OK.

01:01:52.378 --> 01:01:55.089
No, I, uh... I shouldn't have done that.

01:01:55.214 --> 01:01:59.427
- Not tonight, anyway.
- No, it's OK. It's crazy, but it's OK.

01:02:02.471 --> 01:02:05.766
Breaking news.
A tragic accident downtown

01:02:05.892 --> 01:02:08.478
has left six people dead
and several injured.

01:02:08.603 --> 01:02:11.230
An elderly man driving an orange van...

01:02:14.192 --> 01:02:17.153
...crashed into a crowded
bus shelter. So far...

01:02:19.113 --> 01:02:20.615
Are you OK, Abe?

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.994
Witnesses say the van appeared to
deliberately swerve for the commuters...

01:02:25.119 --> 01:02:26.579
Yeah. Um...

01:02:27.079 --> 01:02:29.207
Sherry, I gotta go.

01:02:29.332 --> 01:02:32.376
- Is it someone you know?
- Yeah.

01:02:32.502 --> 01:02:34.545
I'll call you, OK?

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:40.718
If save, must kill.
If save, must kill.

01:02:57.193 --> 01:02:59.737
"The third day"?

01:03:06.911 --> 01:03:11.833
Authorities found George Sutter in his
kitchen, no attempt to cover up his spree.

01:03:11.958 --> 01:03:16.963
The bodies of his wife and children were
found in their beds, butchered so severely

01:03:17.088 --> 01:03:20.091
that dental records
will be necessary for an ID.

01:03:20.216 --> 01:03:22.677
Sutter has no history
of domestic violence

01:03:22.802 --> 01:03:25.763
and, when pressed,
could offer no explanation as to...

01:03:25.888 --> 01:03:30.017
Beverly Ann Cloy, a registered
nurse for the past 27 years,

01:03:30.143 --> 01:03:35.231
smothered 14 of her patients this morning.
She then clocked out and calmly...

01:03:35.356 --> 01:03:39.777
There's no explanation why Dickson
lost control of the plane...

01:03:39.902 --> 01:03:45.032
...absolutely no reason...
... offer no explanation...

01:03:45.158 --> 01:03:47.702
Always on the third day...

01:03:48.786 --> 01:03:51.414
after Caine saved them.

01:04:02.967 --> 01:04:08.055
Authorities are confounded as to why
the man drove into the bus stop,

01:04:08.181 --> 01:04:12.143
and we are told that there is
no obvious ulterior motive.

01:04:12.268 --> 01:04:16.814
"On the third day,
Christ shall rise again. "

01:04:19.484 --> 01:04:21.944
But what about the devil?

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:26.616
What about the devil?
What does he do on the third day?

01:04:28.951 --> 01:04:31.078
What's the thing with the third day?

01:04:36.250 --> 01:04:38.544
"Revelation 13:18."

01:04:42.965 --> 01:04:49.263
"Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast. "

01:04:49.388 --> 01:04:53.768
"Let him that hath understanding
count the number of the beast:

01:04:53.893 --> 01:04:59.607
For it is the number of a man; and his
number is Six hundred and sixty six. "

01:05:04.487 --> 01:05:10.701
"The Bible written in Roman times
for Ancient Greek-speaking audiences. "

01:05:11.285 --> 01:05:14.247
"All Greek and Ancient Greek... "

01:05:14.372 --> 01:05:17.416
"... letters have
numerical counterparts. "

01:05:18.626 --> 01:05:21.254
Always on the third day.

01:05:22.338 --> 01:05:24.882
But what about the devil?

01:05:25.007 --> 01:05:28.553
What about the devil?
What does he do on the third day?

01:05:28.678 --> 01:05:30.763
Third day...

01:05:31.305 --> 01:05:34.058
after Caine saved them.

01:05:34.183 --> 01:05:39.230
"The Bible written in Roman times
for Ancient reek-speaking audiences. "

01:05:39.355 --> 01:05:44.318
"All Greek and Ancient Greek letters
have numerical counterparts. "

01:06:15.892 --> 01:06:19.103
Tria Mera.

01:06:26.944 --> 01:06:29.238
T- t-tria...

01:06:29.363 --> 01:06:31.949
M- m-m-m-mer...

01:07:39.934 --> 01:07:43.604
"Lucifer - from the Latin
meaning giver of light. "

01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:46.357
"The archangel
who was thrown out of heaven

01:07:46.482 --> 01:07:50.820
for trying to usurp God's power
for his own purposes. "

01:07:50.945 --> 01:07:54.407
"The one once named Lucifer in heaven

01:07:54.532 --> 01:07:59.412
is now known as the devil

01:07:59.537 --> 01:08:02.623
on Earth. "

01:08:13.885 --> 01:08:16.761
The third day is the devil's signature.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.349
That kid I saved on the bridge.

01:08:21.517 --> 01:08:23.185
Today's the third day.

01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:17.573
I brought him into the hospital the
day I helped you. I need to find him.

01:09:17.698 --> 01:09:19.908
I really shouldn't be doing this, Abe.

01:09:20.033 --> 01:09:22.870
Seems to be par for the course
with us, Sherry.

01:09:22.995 --> 01:09:25.038
Yeah.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.335
OK, Kurt Green.

01:09:29.460 --> 01:09:32.921
- Sir Alfred Hotel. - Sir Alfred.
Of course. Thank you, Sherry.

01:09:33.046 --> 01:09:35.633
- Abe.
- Yeah.

01:09:35.758 --> 01:09:38.426
Are we OK?

01:09:38.553 --> 01:09:40.054
I hope so.

01:09:41.973 --> 01:09:43.850
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:10:33.065 --> 01:10:35.067
- Yeah.
- Abe, jeez.

01:10:35.193 --> 01:10:38.446
Marty, listen,
I think I understand why Caine did it.

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:42.074
He thought he had to. He did it
because he thought he had no choice.

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:45.244
- Did what? - I save the man,
he takes out a bus stop.

01:10:45.369 --> 01:10:48.372
I saved that kid.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

01:10:48.498 --> 01:10:53.044
Terrible things happen on the third day
after using the light to save somebody.

01:10:53.169 --> 01:10:56.130
- Are you listening to yourself, man?
- No, you listen.

01:10:56.255 --> 01:10:59.300
Maybe it's Lucifer
or the devil or these ghosts.

01:10:59.425 --> 01:11:02.178
Whatever it is, I know
I can stop it, Marty,

01:11:02.303 --> 01:11:05.014
before anyone else gets hurt.

01:11:05.139 --> 01:11:08.476
You know you're my boy, right?
And I love you. I really do.

01:11:08.601 --> 01:11:14.190
I'm not gonna stand by and watch you
do this to yourself. I can't. I won't.

01:11:14.315 --> 01:11:18.611
We've got a business. I can't do this
by myself, man. We've got things to do.

01:11:18.736 --> 01:11:21.155
This is the bus stop.

01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:26.160
Marty. Marty, I...

01:11:26.285 --> 01:11:29.205
- Say that again. I can't hear you.

01:11:35.169 --> 01:11:37.797
If save, must kill.

01:11:37.922 --> 01:11:41.008
Must kill. Must kill. Must kill.

01:12:12.623 --> 01:12:14.667
Kurt. Kurt.

01:12:14.792 --> 01:12:16.836
Kurt!

01:12:31.726 --> 01:12:33.936
I'm terribly sorry.

01:12:36.439 --> 01:12:38.232
I sincerely apologise.

01:12:50.411 --> 01:12:52.622
I'm sorry. I apologise.

01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:03.382
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Get down.

01:13:05.927 --> 01:13:08.805
He's got a gun!

01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:11.015
- Let's go!

01:13:13.142 --> 01:13:17.522
- Just put the gun down.
- Other side. Other side.

01:13:18.773 --> 01:13:21.400
- Easy.
- Kurt!

01:13:30.159 --> 01:13:33.287
Go, go, go! Now!
I got him. I got him.

01:13:35.373 --> 01:13:40.628
- Keep calm. Slowly exit the building.
- This way, please.

01:13:47.051 --> 01:13:50.179
Hold on. Kurt!

01:13:50.304 --> 01:13:52.932
Kurt, what's wrong? Kurt!

01:13:54.934 --> 01:13:57.311
Kurt!

01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:09.907
Tria Mera.

01:14:47.236 --> 01:14:49.947
I need you to go downstairs
right away. Call 911.

01:15:19.227 --> 01:15:21.354
Why?

01:15:23.147 --> 01:15:25.441
I don't think you should've saved me.

01:16:33.009 --> 01:16:35.511
7:30.

01:16:45.730 --> 01:16:47.190
Sherry.

01:18:46.267 --> 01:18:49.729
Must kill.
If save, must kill.

01:18:49.854 --> 01:18:54.609
- If save, must kill. If save,
must kill. - Kill. Kill.

01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:51.958
You made it.

01:19:54.794 --> 01:19:58.631
- I've been worried sick about you.
- What for?

01:19:58.756 --> 01:20:01.050
I heard what happened at the hotel.

01:20:01.175 --> 01:20:04.262
First you save that kid's life, and...

01:20:04.387 --> 01:20:06.681
You must feel awful, Abe.

01:20:07.557 --> 01:20:10.101
Sherry, I need to talk to you.

01:20:11.561 --> 01:20:13.688
About what?

01:20:14.438 --> 01:20:18.067
- Outside. I'll tell you outside.
- You can tell me right here.

01:20:18.192 --> 01:20:22.655
- I can't explain in front of
all these people. - Why not?

01:20:23.573 --> 01:20:27.410
If save, must kill.

01:20:30.538 --> 01:20:33.583
- What is it, Abe?
- Must kill.

01:20:34.917 --> 01:20:38.838
- You have to come with me. - What
are you doing? You're hurting me.

01:20:38.963 --> 01:20:41.007
- I have to do this.
- Do what?

01:20:41.132 --> 01:20:44.218
Sherry, I shouldn't have saved you.

01:20:45.845 --> 01:20:47.638
- Calm down.
- You don't...

01:20:47.763 --> 01:20:50.099
- Calm down.
- You don't understand.

01:20:50.224 --> 01:20:53.019
- Get away from her.
- It doesn't involve you!

01:20:53.144 --> 01:20:56.230
Listen to me. Sherry!

01:20:57.148 --> 01:20:59.358
Sherry!

01:21:22.965 --> 01:21:26.219
Many will die.
Many will die.

01:21:34.602 --> 01:21:38.356
Many will die. Many will die.

01:22:33.119 --> 01:22:37.623
No, no, no. Not here. Anywhere but here.

01:23:50.238 --> 01:23:54.200
Here's the menu.
I'll be right back to take your order.

01:24:56.345 --> 01:25:01.601
The old man who killed all
those people, you saved him.

01:25:01.726 --> 01:25:05.354
And the kid from the hotel,
you saved him too.

01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:15.156
And then you saved me.

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.244
I'm so sorry, Sherry.

01:25:28.461 --> 01:25:30.963
Don't be.

01:25:50.942 --> 01:25:53.361
That man, he has a gun.

01:25:53.486 --> 01:25:56.239
Police. Put the gun down.

01:25:56.364 --> 01:26:00.952
Listen to him, sir.
No one wants to get hurt, right?

01:26:02.453 --> 01:26:05.498
Put it down.

01:26:48.207 --> 01:26:51.961
Please, just make it stop.

01:26:52.795 --> 01:26:54.797
You...

01:26:55.882 --> 01:26:58.217
you have to die.

01:27:40.843 --> 01:27:42.678
Ma'am.

01:27:43.763 --> 01:27:46.224
Please, leave him.

01:28:08.287 --> 01:28:10.665
If save, must kill.

01:28:10.790 --> 01:28:14.043
Kill. Kill. Kill.

01:28:16.254 --> 01:28:17.922
I got her.

01:28:20.633 --> 01:28:24.178
Kill. Kill. Kill.

01:28:24.303 --> 01:28:27.223
She's going into shock.
Let's get her out of here.

01:28:27.348 --> 01:28:29.433
Kill. Kill.

01:28:29.559 --> 01:28:31.602
Come on.

01:29:31.162 --> 01:29:33.372
Shit!

01:29:38.044 --> 01:29:41.088
- I've never seen this before.
- Note the time and sedate.

01:29:41.214 --> 01:29:43.591
7:29pm.

01:29:46.636 --> 01:29:49.680
- 2ccs Versed.
- Shut her up.

01:29:51.557 --> 01:29:53.184
What the hell?

01:29:55.728 --> 01:29:57.605
Tria Mera.

01:30:59.625 --> 01:31:00.918
Tommy.

01:31:55.014 --> 01:31:57.433
Are you all right? Come here.
