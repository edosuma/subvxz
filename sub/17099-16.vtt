00:51.786 --> 00:54.153
Oh...

00:54.155 --> 00:56.688
- I presume this is it.
- Oh yes, we're coming

00:56.690 --> 01:00.359
under her now. I got
my floors all mixed up is all.

01:00.361 --> 01:04.063
- When did you discover her?
- Uh, this morning.

01:04.065 --> 01:06.899
She's been in here
quite some time, Mr. Grandy.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.601
Do you know
how many buildings

01:09.603 --> 01:11.737
I look in on,
son? You expect me

01:11.739 --> 01:13.806
to scour every
floor every day?

01:15.743 --> 01:18.811
I'll take it from here. If
I need you, I'll come find you.

01:18.813 --> 01:22.481
Ah! All these stairs...

01:41.502 --> 01:44.336
Who's there?

01:50.778 --> 01:52.945
That is mine.

01:52.947 --> 01:55.047
Detective William Murdoch,
Toronto Constabulary.

01:55.049 --> 01:58.117
- Identify yourself.
- Howard Philips Lovecraft.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.119
What are you doing here?

02:01.889 --> 02:04.923
Visiting her, of course.

02:04.925 --> 02:07.926
Hello, my dear.

02:11.499 --> 02:15.100
Do not touch...

02:23.477 --> 02:27.246
- I enjoy drawing.
- I see that.

02:27.248 --> 02:29.948
Reading as well.
Gothic stories especially.

02:29.950 --> 02:33.051
Hm. Did you know her?

02:33.053 --> 02:35.687
Do you enjoy reading?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.557
Yes. The girl,
Mr. Lovecraft--

02:38.559 --> 02:40.759
What do you
enjoy reading?

02:40.761 --> 02:43.662
Anything from
science periodicals

02:43.664 --> 02:47.166
to Shakespeare. Now young man,
did you know the deceased?

02:47.168 --> 02:49.835
- Yes.
- What is her name?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.104
I don't know.

02:52.106 --> 02:54.173
Then how is it
that you know her?

02:54.175 --> 02:56.775
From drawing her!

02:56.777 --> 02:59.411
Once she was
already dead?

03:02.283 --> 03:04.616
You never met her
prior to her death?

03:04.618 --> 03:07.452
No. We became
close since.

03:07.454 --> 03:10.189
And I believe that
we will meet again.

03:17.331 --> 03:19.398
How long have you
been drawing her?

03:19.400 --> 03:22.868
I couldn't say. Time
is not of consequence.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.803
In this instance,
I'm afraid it is.

03:24.805 --> 03:27.439
A few weeks,
I suppose.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.877
And how did you
come to find her?

03:31.879 --> 03:34.546
A boy told me
of her.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.249
- What is <i>his</i> name?
- Clinton Hartley.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.084
I can tell you where
to find him if you'd like.

03:39.086 --> 03:41.186
Yes, please.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.390
May I continue
to draw her?

03:50.631 --> 03:53.265
<i>Decomposition</i> was
helped along by rats,

03:53.267 --> 03:55.601
making identification
impossible.

03:55.603 --> 03:57.636
But I can say with some
certainty that she was young,

03:57.638 --> 04:00.339
fifteen or
sixteen perhaps.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.908
And the
cause of death?

04:02.910 --> 04:04.910
Asphyxiation.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.112
I believe she was smothered
with the handkerchief you found

04:07.114 --> 04:10.482
at the scene. I found
matching particles in her lungs.

04:10.484 --> 04:13.452
- So, no wounds then?
- No!

04:13.454 --> 04:16.755
I can't explain the blood on the
handkerchief or on her clothes.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.625
Only to say
that it wasn't hers.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.959
It belonged to her assailant?

04:21.962 --> 04:24.663
Also, the handkerchief
was doused with chloroform.

04:24.665 --> 04:27.165
She would have
gone painlessly.

04:27.167 --> 04:30.502
A compassionate killing. So,
she could have known her killer.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.440
She didn't arrive with
this pendant, did she?

04:35.442 --> 04:37.342
No,

04:37.344 --> 04:39.344
only the clothes that remained.

04:39.346 --> 04:41.613
And now the pendant's gone.

04:41.615 --> 04:45.217
It could have been a figment
of Mr. Lovecraft's imagination.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.953
Yet why include it
in the early drawings

04:47.955 --> 04:50.055
and not on later ones?

04:50.057 --> 04:52.124
Unless the killer
returned to retrieve it.

04:52.126 --> 04:55.694
Mr. Hartley,

04:55.696 --> 04:57.729
how do you know Mr. Lovecraft?

04:57.731 --> 05:00.399
He sought me out after
discovering I'd borrowed

05:00.401 --> 05:02.534
his favourite book
from the library.

05:02.536 --> 05:05.003
Edgar Allen Poe's
<i>The Masque of the Red Death.</i>

05:05.005 --> 05:08.073
- Have you read it?
- No.

05:08.075 --> 05:12.411
- And when was this?
- Perhaps a month ago.

05:14.615 --> 05:17.082
So, the two of you
became friends.

05:17.084 --> 05:21.253
Yes, we are rather like-
minded. Don't you think?

05:21.255 --> 05:25.057
Although I admit I am not quite
as drawn to death as Howard.

05:25.059 --> 05:27.726
And yet you informed
him of the body

05:27.728 --> 05:29.795
you found in the
abandoned building.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.399
When did you
do that?

05:34.401 --> 05:37.936
Shortly after we met.
Four weeks ago.

05:37.938 --> 05:41.206
And how is it that
you... found this body?

05:41.208 --> 05:44.609
I was scouring
for valuables.

05:44.611 --> 05:47.112
Yes.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.617
Is this one of
the valuables that you found?

05:55.456 --> 05:59.024
No, I've never
seen that before.

06:01.395 --> 06:04.162
Describe for me what the body
looked like when you found it.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.631
I can't.

06:06.633 --> 06:09.167
I only got close enough
to make out that it was a girl

06:09.169 --> 06:11.870
at the dress.

06:11.872 --> 06:15.440
The stench kept me
at a distance.

06:15.442 --> 06:19.244
Surely your parents
taught you to inform the police

06:19.246 --> 06:22.080
when you found
such a thing?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.082
I don't speak
with my parents.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.134
What an odd-looking
group of youths, George.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.886
Hm...

07:05.993 --> 07:08.627
Margaret, what are you doing

07:08.629 --> 07:10.629
- here?
- Verna Jones is making me lead

07:10.631 --> 07:13.131
the discussion on
this dreadful Dracula book

07:13.133 --> 07:15.100
- for our reading club.
- So what?

07:15.102 --> 07:17.869
Thomas, this book is
grotesque! It is positively

07:17.871 --> 07:20.705
nightmare-inducing! Verna
is just doing it to spite me.

07:20.707 --> 07:23.375
Who cares about Verna Jones?
Pick a different book then!

07:23.377 --> 07:25.310
Wh-- And let Verna win?

07:25.312 --> 07:27.112
What do you want me
to do about it?

07:27.114 --> 07:28.847
I would like you
to escort me to the morgue

07:28.849 --> 07:31.416
to speak to Dr. Ogden.
She's a learned woman after all,

07:31.418 --> 07:33.185
and deals in the macabre.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.954
Talk to her yourself,
Margaret. I'm working.

07:35.956 --> 07:38.557
Work? You're just
sitting there like a lump!

07:38.559 --> 07:41.026
Yes, at work.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.368
Why do you live with
your aunt, Mr. Lovecraft?

07:50.370 --> 07:53.004
My father died
from mental exhaustion

07:53.006 --> 07:55.373
after years
in an insane asylum.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.343
I'm sorry
to hear that.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.579
And your mother?

08:00.581 --> 08:03.915
She now resides in
the same asylum in Providence.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.984
Good lord.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.420
And that's not
to say that...

08:08.422 --> 08:11.256
your... destiny
is determined.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.658
Or perhaps it is.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.294
Oh, hello.

08:16.296 --> 08:18.897
- Hello, Mrs. Brackenreid.
- Hello.

08:18.899 --> 08:21.500
The Inspector's wife.
Lovely lady.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.005
We have
a common interest.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.940
Oh? What's that?

08:28.942 --> 08:31.943
Blood. Salvation.

08:31.945 --> 08:35.547
I really must
be going, young man.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.751
Your hands...

08:40.754 --> 08:43.121
These fingers...

08:43.123 --> 08:46.291
Mr. Lovecraft,
your aunt

08:46.293 --> 08:48.793
will be here very soon. Thank
you, Mrs. Brackenreid.

08:48.795 --> 08:51.596
Mrs. Brackenreid...

08:51.598 --> 08:53.498
No one but a woman
can help a man

08:53.500 --> 08:56.101
when he is in trouble
of the heart.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.672
What was this Clinton
Hartley lad doing

09:00.674 --> 09:03.141
- in an abandoned building?
- Scavenging for valuables,

09:03.143 --> 09:05.176
- he claims.
- I thought he was rich!

09:05.178 --> 09:06.912
Rebelling against
his father's wealth.

09:06.914 --> 09:08.914
Rebelling against wealth.
What's the matter with--

09:08.916 --> 09:11.883
Well...

09:13.954 --> 09:17.656
I don't want the others
to know I'm speaking with you.

09:17.658 --> 09:21.793
Alright. Have a seat.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.566
How did you get
in here, young lady?

09:31.939 --> 09:35.574
I know the pendant,
from the newspaper.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.742
What was her name?

09:37.744 --> 09:41.346
Ellen Woods.
How did she die?

09:41.348 --> 09:44.115
- And your name?
- Sarah Glass.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.151
Miss Glass,

09:46.153 --> 09:48.486
is this Ellen Woods?

09:48.488 --> 09:50.956
Looks like
Howard's drawings.

09:50.958 --> 09:54.359
- You know Mr. Lovecraft?
- He's the newest member

09:54.361 --> 09:57.762
in our group. He draws
such... loving portraits.

09:57.764 --> 10:01.700
Was Miss Woods
a member of this group?

10:01.702 --> 10:04.736
For a short while.
But nobody cared for her.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.973
- Why is that?
- No reason exactly,

10:07.975 --> 10:10.742
just that everyone
seemed to start fighting

10:10.744 --> 10:13.211
- when Ian brought her in.
- Ian?

10:13.213 --> 10:17.549
Ian Blair. Ellen was
a cousin of his from Oshawa.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.051
New to Toronto.
He felt...

10:20.053 --> 10:22.587
obliged to welcome her,
I suppose.

10:22.589 --> 10:25.056
- But she didn't fit in.
- Our interests

10:25.058 --> 10:28.460
- aren't shared by most.
- What interests are those?

10:28.462 --> 10:31.830
- Death.
- Making your parents proud, are you?

10:31.832 --> 10:35.033
We don't care what our parents
or anyone else thinks of us.

10:35.035 --> 10:37.469
Surely you found it strange

10:37.471 --> 10:39.537
when Miss Woods
suddenly disappeared?

10:39.539 --> 10:42.540
We thought she went
back to Oshawa,

10:42.542 --> 10:45.810
as she had often threatened
whenever anyone was hard on her.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.246
Clinton especially.

10:48.248 --> 10:51.516
Thank you, Miss Glass.

10:51.518 --> 10:54.919
If we have further
questions we'll contact you.

11:02.929 --> 11:05.697
If Miss Woods was
a member of their group

11:05.699 --> 11:08.099
and Miss Glass recognized
her from the pendants

11:08.101 --> 11:09.968
- and drawings...
- Surely Clinton Hartley

11:09.970 --> 11:12.470
- did as well.
- And he lied to us.

11:12.472 --> 11:15.807
- Bring him back in.
- Yes, sir.

11:26.086 --> 11:28.853
Hello?

12:06.426 --> 12:09.694
Is anybody there?!

12:11.631 --> 12:13.732
Hello?

12:15.268 --> 12:17.936
Julia? AH!!

12:17.938 --> 12:20.371
Margaret,
what are you doing here?

12:20.373 --> 12:23.475
Oh, I, uh... I want
to discuss something with you.

12:23.477 --> 12:26.044
- What is it?
- Dracula.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.646
The book!
For my reading club.

12:28.648 --> 12:31.783
You're shaking
like a leaf. Is that...

12:31.785 --> 12:34.219
- my scalpel?
- I thought

12:34.221 --> 12:36.287
I heard something
behind that door.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.957
That's
the cold storage.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.025
Unless the dead
have come back to life,

12:41.027 --> 12:42.994
I assure you there's
no one back there.

12:42.996 --> 12:44.963
Oh, I was certain
I heard something.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.599
Look.

12:47.601 --> 12:50.034
You see?

12:50.036 --> 12:51.936
- AAH!!
- What on earth are you doing

12:51.938 --> 12:54.339
- in here!? Get out!
- I wanted to see her again.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.442
Agh! Stay put! I'm
calling the constables.

12:57.444 --> 13:00.411
You're bleeding.

13:00.413 --> 13:04.215
"Do you believe
in destiny?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.484
"That even the powers of time

13:06.486 --> 13:09.320
"can be altered
for a single purpose?

13:09.322 --> 13:12.791
"That the luckiest man
who walks this earth

13:12.793 --> 13:15.226
is the one
who finds true love?"

13:19.833 --> 13:23.134
Young man,
get... get up!

13:23.136 --> 13:25.670
Get up!

13:25.672 --> 13:28.840
Out. Keep moving!

13:28.842 --> 13:31.676
Get OUT!

13:43.156 --> 13:45.023
Lurking around the bloody
morgue like a lunatic.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.958
- What's wrong with him?
- He doesn't seem to see

13:46.960 --> 13:48.626
anything wrong
with his behavior,

13:48.628 --> 13:51.229
- no matter how misguided.
- Someone needs to instill

13:51.231 --> 13:53.231
some principles. A spell
in the army would sort him out

13:53.233 --> 13:55.767
- quickly enough.
- Or perhaps, sirs,

13:55.769 --> 13:58.736
a more gentle form of guidance
might benefit the young man.

13:58.738 --> 14:01.806
- What do you know about children?
- Well I was one.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.008
Still bloody are,
half the time.

14:04.010 --> 14:07.212
So what do we do with him? We
don't have enough to arrest him

14:07.214 --> 14:09.747
and I don't feel
comfortable letting him go.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.684
Well, we can't trust his aunt
to keep him under lock and key.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.086
- Keep him here?
- No,

14:15.088 --> 14:18.256
I've got a better idea.
Crabtree can take care of him.

14:18.258 --> 14:21.292
He seems to know everything
about child-rearing.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.595
Sir, I'd be happy to.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.763
I believe this young man
and myself might have more

14:25.765 --> 14:27.765
in common than you think.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.869
I have been through
my own spells of melancholy.

14:30.871 --> 14:33.838
Well, that's settled then. No
doubt Mr. Lovecraft will leave

14:33.840 --> 14:37.141
a boy and return a man courtesy
of George Crabtree, esquire.

14:37.143 --> 14:39.878
And sir, I may be no
miracle worker, but I believe

14:39.880 --> 14:42.947
I can help lift the dark
cloud that hovers over him.

14:42.949 --> 14:46.017
Well, very good!
Thank you, George.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.019
And when that dark cloud
lifts, sir, not only will

14:48.021 --> 14:50.255
the sun warm Mr. Lovecraft,
it may also shed

14:50.257 --> 14:52.390
- some light on our case.
- Or it'll rain buckets

14:52.392 --> 14:54.492
like a November Monday in
Yorkshire on both of you.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.128
The sun shines sir,
even in Yorkshire.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.731
Not on November
Mondays, it doesn't.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.673
That's meant
to be Ellen?

15:08.675 --> 15:11.209
It's a rendering
by Mr. Lovecraft, yes.

15:11.211 --> 15:14.746
Surely you recognized
that pendant

15:14.748 --> 15:17.315
as being hers when I
showed it to you the first time.

15:17.317 --> 15:21.352
No, I don't pay attention
to pendants and dresses.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.321
Your friend Sarah did.

15:23.323 --> 15:26.658
Well, I suppose girls notice
things that boys do not.

15:26.660 --> 15:29.360
Or, there's another
explanation. You lied to me.

15:29.362 --> 15:32.764
Because you had something
to do with her death.

15:32.766 --> 15:35.366
I did not.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.568
Could one of the other
members of your group, then?

15:37.570 --> 15:40.104
- No.
- You were the first one

15:40.106 --> 15:42.040
to discover her body
by your own admission,

15:42.042 --> 15:43.942
and yet you never
reported it to the police?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.344
As I told you before,

15:46.346 --> 15:48.579
Howard said he would
inform the police.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.218
Did Mr. Lovecraft
and Ellen

15:54.220 --> 15:56.387
ever meet,
to your knowledge?

15:56.389 --> 15:59.891
I don't think so.

15:59.893 --> 16:03.061
What was
Mr. Lovecraft's reaction

16:03.063 --> 16:05.930
when you first
told him about the body?

16:05.932 --> 16:08.099
Somehow he didn't
seem surprised.

16:08.101 --> 16:11.369
As if he knew
about it already?

16:16.810 --> 16:19.811
I don't need to see it.

16:19.813 --> 16:21.746
I already heard
everything from Clinton.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.748
Heh...

16:23.750 --> 16:27.385
I understand you
and Ellen Woods were cousins.

16:27.387 --> 16:31.622
Yes, when she arrived from
Oshawa I tried to include her.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.325
But your friends...
didn't take to her?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.728
Perhaps if they
gave her a chance...

16:39.332 --> 16:42.734
Where did you imagine
she disappeared to?

16:42.736 --> 16:45.136
Back to Oshawa.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.705
When she failed to arrive,
did your family not alert you?

16:47.707 --> 16:50.808
I don't talk
to my family.

16:50.810 --> 16:54.278
Well, who do you
live with then?

16:54.280 --> 16:57.615
I live with
the others. At Logan's.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.018
Is this Logan also
a member of your group?

17:00.020 --> 17:03.421
Yes, we all keep
a room at his house.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.823
Ian, come on!

17:05.825 --> 17:08.092
I finally secured
the Balloon Lung Tester!

17:08.094 --> 17:11.194
- May I go?
- This Logan's surname

17:11.196 --> 17:14.732
and address, first.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.137
Logan Smiley.
912 Wellington.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.873
Come on, Ian.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.112
Isn't this nice?

17:28.114 --> 17:31.716
There's beauty all
around us, Mr. Lovecraft.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.452
One need only open
their eyes to see it.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.621
My eyes are wide open.

17:36.623 --> 17:39.824
Then surely you can
appreciate the, the...

17:39.826 --> 17:42.293
changing colours
of the autumn leaves.

17:42.295 --> 17:45.229
As their veins choke off
the nutrition they require

17:45.231 --> 17:48.232
to remain green.
Their last gasp

17:48.234 --> 17:50.101
as they desperately
cling to their lifeline

17:50.103 --> 17:52.804
before their inevitable
death and descent.

17:55.241 --> 17:58.576
Eh...

17:58.578 --> 18:02.713
Then the leaves are
absorbed into the ground,

18:02.715 --> 18:05.550
which provides the soil
with the nutrition it needs

18:05.552 --> 18:08.453
to feed the trees which fostered
the leaves to begin with.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.422
It's a, uh...
beautiful circle of life!

18:11.424 --> 18:15.193
Decay begets
more death and decay.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.261
Look,

18:17.263 --> 18:19.430
Mr. Lovecraft.
That squirrel.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.999
Surely you can't
deny his industry,

18:22.001 --> 18:24.836
his preparation for winter.

18:24.838 --> 18:28.339
No sooner than I can deny
the likelihood of its death.

18:28.341 --> 18:30.708
The ground
will freeze over,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.578
his own kind as likely
to steal his cache as he is

18:33.580 --> 18:36.380
to rediscover it in his
struggle to endure the winter.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.827
I understand the others spend
quite a bit of their time here,

18:49.829 --> 18:52.530
Mr. Smiley? Your
father doesn't mind?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.398
He's dead.

18:54.400 --> 18:56.467
And mother's glad I have
friends to keep me occupied

18:56.469 --> 18:59.036
while she travels
with her latest paramour.

18:59.038 --> 19:02.874
Is it true that you and
Ellen Woods did not get along?

19:02.876 --> 19:06.077
- None of us did.
- Not even her cousin?

19:06.079 --> 19:10.081
Ian got along with her fine.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.550
What was the problem exactly?

19:12.552 --> 19:15.453
She and Clinton
fought frequently.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.089
It created a sense
of unease amongst the group.

19:18.091 --> 19:22.260
- I was happy when she left.
- Is that so?

19:22.262 --> 19:25.496
Well, I mean before
I found out she was murdered.

19:25.498 --> 19:29.167
I assume she kept
a room here as well?

19:29.169 --> 19:33.070
Yes. It's Howard's now.
Nothing of Ellen's remains.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.374
Even so.

19:38.244 --> 19:40.845
Do you really think
that squirrel will die?

19:40.847 --> 19:44.015
We all will. The
only question is when.

19:44.017 --> 19:47.251
I suppose you're
right, you know.

19:47.253 --> 19:51.455
It's enough to make you wonder
what the point of it all is.

19:51.457 --> 19:55.059
I mean, we all spend our lives
just as this squirrel

19:55.061 --> 19:59.030
clawing, scratching,
trying to get by.

19:59.032 --> 20:02.700
In the end we all end up
in the same place anyway.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.769
But surely

20:04.771 --> 20:08.239
there's beauty to be found
in our daily struggles.

20:08.241 --> 20:11.842
I think that's what gives
life it's depth, Mr.--

20:11.844 --> 20:15.680
...Lovecraft!?

20:20.186 --> 20:22.553
These are all
Mr. Lovecraft's belongings?

20:22.555 --> 20:24.855
Yes, I threw out
all of Ellen's things

20:24.857 --> 20:27.525
after she disappeared.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.976
<i>- It's a love letter, sir.</i>
- "For never was there a story

20:44.978 --> 20:48.012
of more woe than ours."
Quoting the Bard!

20:48.014 --> 20:50.481
- Bloody pretentious.
- Indeed. It's filled

20:50.483 --> 20:53.985
with youthful angst and the
language is melodramatic

20:53.987 --> 20:56.921
and dense, but the
sentiment is unmistakable.

20:56.923 --> 20:59.757
It's signed by Miss Woods,
but not directly addressed

20:59.759 --> 21:03.060
- to anyone, nor is it dated.
- No, sir.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.229
I found it in
Mr. Lovecraft's room

21:05.231 --> 21:07.999
amongst his personal effects.

21:08.001 --> 21:11.068
"To my Love," although generic,
could have been Miss Woods'

21:11.070 --> 21:14.138
- pet name for Mr. Lovecraft.
- Well, if you're right,

21:14.140 --> 21:16.040
this establishes a relationship
between the two of them

21:16.042 --> 21:17.875
while Miss Woods
was still alive.

21:17.877 --> 21:21.279
And Mr. Lovecraft's perverted
fascination with death alone

21:21.281 --> 21:24.215
- could provide motive.
- He prefers the dead

21:24.217 --> 21:26.117
to the living, maybe
that extended to his most

21:26.119 --> 21:28.319
intimate relationships.

21:28.321 --> 21:30.354
- Julia.
- Doctor.

21:30.356 --> 21:33.024
- Burning the midnight oil?
- I was taking a final look

21:33.026 --> 21:35.526
at Miss Wood's body
when I discovered something

21:35.528 --> 21:37.194
- rather disturbing.
- What is it?

21:37.196 --> 21:39.797
Her left ring finger
has been severed.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.832
It happened
since she arrived.

21:41.834 --> 21:44.068
Mr. Lovecraft.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.437
- Crabtree!
- Sir.

21:46.439 --> 21:48.906
- Bring me Lovecraft.
- I can't, sir.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.676
- I lost him.
- You lost him?

21:51.678 --> 21:54.378
Sir, I've looked
all over Toronto.

21:54.380 --> 21:57.214
<i>"Do you believe in destiny?</i>

21:57.216 --> 21:59.817
<i>"That even the powers
of time can be altered</i>

21:59.819 --> 22:02.053
<i>"for a single purpose?</i>

22:02.055 --> 22:05.289
<i>"That the luckiest man
who walks this earth</i>

22:05.291 --> 22:07.358
<i>is the one who finds True Love?"</i>

22:10.630 --> 22:14.298
Oh dear.

22:27.480 --> 22:31.248
Stop talking to him,
Mina, you foolish woman.

22:31.250 --> 22:33.784
Walk away.

22:42.762 --> 22:45.429
Hello?

22:49.168 --> 22:51.669
John, is that you?

22:51.671 --> 22:54.071
Thomas? Hello?

23:08.388 --> 23:10.654
Do you like it,
Mrs. Brackenreid?

23:20.199 --> 23:22.032
I should knock his block off.
Margaret didn't get a wink

23:22.034 --> 23:23.868
of sleep last night,
which means I didn't either!

23:23.870 --> 23:27.938
Sir, he's just a boy.
No older than your son, John.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.207
John doesn't go around
spooking housewives

23:30.209 --> 23:33.277
- with severed body parts!
- I understand your frustration,

23:33.279 --> 23:35.279
but should you do anything
rash, it could compromise

23:35.281 --> 23:37.882
- our investigation.
- Get a confession

23:37.884 --> 23:40.985
- and be done with him.
- Sir.

23:45.224 --> 23:49.126
I do not like this room!

23:49.128 --> 23:53.431
No one does. Please
have a seat, Mr. Lovecraft.

23:57.537 --> 24:00.704
Miss Woods is now
missing a finger

24:00.706 --> 24:02.973
and Mrs. Brackenreid
has an extra.

24:02.975 --> 24:05.943
- Yes, I gave it to her.
- After trespassing

24:05.945 --> 24:08.412
into the city morgue
and severing it.

24:08.414 --> 24:11.982
Do you not see how completely
inappropriate that is?

24:11.984 --> 24:14.385
No.

24:19.592 --> 24:22.426
I found this in your
room at Mr. Smiley's.

24:22.428 --> 24:25.396
- What is it?
- It's a correspondence,

24:25.398 --> 24:28.566
from Miss Woods to you.
Despite the fact that you said

24:28.568 --> 24:31.335
- you didn't know her.
- I never said that.

24:31.337 --> 24:34.705
Correction, that you
knew her only in death.

24:34.707 --> 24:37.374
This proves otherwise.

24:40.580 --> 24:43.180
It was found in
your room, Mr. Lovecraft.

24:43.182 --> 24:46.851
- May I keep it then?
- No you may not

24:46.853 --> 24:49.687
keep it, it's evidence.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.889
Evidence that,
along with other factors,

24:51.891 --> 24:54.692
strongly suggests that
you killed Miss Woods.

24:54.694 --> 24:59.096
- You.
- To me she is not dead,

24:59.098 --> 25:01.632
- but eternal.
- Did you kill her?

25:01.634 --> 25:03.801
- No!
- Did you know her

25:03.803 --> 25:05.936
- prior to her death?
- No!

25:05.938 --> 25:08.072
Did you sever
her finger postmortem?

25:08.074 --> 25:10.975
Yes.

25:10.977 --> 25:13.143
But you didn't
kill her to begin with?

25:13.145 --> 25:16.647
No, but... I surely
wish I was there

25:16.649 --> 25:18.816
when she passed from
this dimension to the next.

25:18.818 --> 25:22.720
<i>"Denn die todten
reiten schnell."</i>

25:22.722 --> 25:24.722
I do not speak German.

25:24.724 --> 25:26.724
"For the dead
travel fast."

25:26.726 --> 25:28.959
I know all of Dracula.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.898
There is someone else
I'd like you to speak with.

25:33.900 --> 25:38.035
In a setting that you
may find more agreeable.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.242
Do you know the difference
between right and wrong,

25:45.244 --> 25:47.244
Mr. Lovecraft?

25:47.246 --> 25:49.647
That cannot be
answered without context.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.852
Is it wrong
to mutilate a dead body?

25:54.854 --> 25:57.288
I could ask <i>you</i>
the same question.

25:57.290 --> 26:00.824
I conduct post-mortems
as a means to an end.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.661
You severed...
a finger

26:03.663 --> 26:06.363
from a corpse
for no apparent reason.

26:06.365 --> 26:09.300
She did not mind.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.538
Do you believe it's
wrong to kill someone?

26:14.540 --> 26:18.275
Many killings are
justified. <i>You</i> should know.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.813
Would you have been justified
in killing Miss Woods?

26:22.815 --> 26:25.316
If it pleased her.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.685
Why would it please her?

26:30.723 --> 26:33.257
May I speak with
Mrs. Brackenreid instead?

26:33.259 --> 26:36.293
I'm afraid you will
have to make do with me.

26:36.295 --> 26:39.330
You were in a relationship
with Miss Woods. You knew her,

26:39.332 --> 26:41.899
- did you not?
- I've always known her,

26:41.901 --> 26:43.901
through eternity.

26:48.274 --> 26:51.308
Your diagnosis, Julia?

26:51.310 --> 26:54.678
It would be
premature to make one, William.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.748
He's certainly
disturbed, but...

26:57.750 --> 26:59.950
I don't believe
him to be insane.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.820
All I'm prepared to say
is that he has trouble

27:02.822 --> 27:05.956
delineating between
reality and imagination.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.626
But is he
capable of murder?

27:08.628 --> 27:11.295
It wouldn't surprise me.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.031
But why?

27:14.033 --> 27:18.002
The love letter
was one of devotion.

27:18.004 --> 27:21.005
Trying to apply logic
to the circumstances

27:21.007 --> 27:23.707
may not be helpful
in this instance, William.

27:23.709 --> 27:27.311
Frankly, I don't know
<i>what</i> to do with him.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.080
He seems to be
more at ease

27:30.082 --> 27:32.449
expressing
himself creatively.

27:32.451 --> 27:35.285
If you continue
to hold him,

27:35.287 --> 27:37.888
perhaps you should provide
him with a new notebook.

27:40.793 --> 27:43.694
Do you believe
he's a murderer?

27:43.696 --> 27:46.463
I don't yet know.

27:46.465 --> 27:49.600
It has been

27:49.602 --> 27:52.036
a difficult time
since he arrived.

27:52.038 --> 27:56.173
- Since he arrived?
- Yes!

27:56.175 --> 28:00.477
Since Howard joined us from
Providence five weeks ago.

28:00.479 --> 28:05.482
Mr. Lovecraft has only
been in Toronto five weeks?

28:08.554 --> 28:10.554
Mr. Lovecraft,
I have your supper.

28:10.556 --> 28:13.857
Though you hardly deserve it
after abandoning me in the park.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.060
Can you not see
that I am preoccupied?

28:16.062 --> 28:20.431
- What are you writing?
- An account of recent events.

28:20.433 --> 28:23.901
You know, I myself
am a writer,

28:23.903 --> 28:26.637
an experienced
one at that.

28:26.639 --> 28:29.740
And I can personally
attest that one should never

28:29.742 --> 28:33.210
try to write...
on an empty stomach.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.581
You're worse
than my aunt.

28:37.583 --> 28:39.316
Well, you're worse than
most of the guests we have

28:39.318 --> 28:41.318
in this place. And
that's saying something.

28:54.567 --> 28:57.101
I am sorry about
the park, Constable.

28:57.103 --> 28:59.937
I highly doubt that.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.610
Something isn't quite
lining up here, Julia.

29:06.612 --> 29:08.712
Neither are these
buttons, I'm afraid.

29:10.649 --> 29:13.784
As best you could tell,
Ellen Woods was killed

29:13.786 --> 29:16.086
approximately six weeks ago.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.388
And I've just learned
from Mr. Lovecraft's aunt

29:18.390 --> 29:21.759
that he only arrived
in Toronto five weeks ago.

29:21.761 --> 29:24.728
So, if you are right,

29:24.730 --> 29:27.297
which you usually are,
and Mr. Lovecraft's aunt

29:27.299 --> 29:29.600
is telling the truth,
then it's impossible

29:29.602 --> 29:33.003
- that the two ever even met.
- Indeed!

29:33.005 --> 29:35.005
One thing is certain:

29:35.007 --> 29:37.274
Ellen Woods did write this
letter. But perhaps it was

29:37.276 --> 29:40.744
- intended for someone else.
- And planted in Mr. Lovecraft's room?

29:40.746 --> 29:43.480
Yes. And if that's the case,
then perhaps someone else

29:43.482 --> 29:45.649
was in a relationship
with Ellen Woods,

29:45.651 --> 29:47.985
and they could very
likely be the killer.

29:49.789 --> 29:53.123
There. That
should hold.

29:53.125 --> 29:55.292
Thank you, Julia!

30:06.472 --> 30:09.039
Hello!

30:09.041 --> 30:12.276
Ladies and gentlemen,
I believe one of you

30:12.278 --> 30:15.078
was romantically involved
with the deceased.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.881
Now who was it?

30:17.883 --> 30:21.218
If any of you know anything,

30:21.220 --> 30:24.288
you should speak up.

30:24.290 --> 30:26.089
The letter from
Miss Woods that I found

30:26.091 --> 30:29.526
in Mr. Lovecraft's room, it
was intended for someone else.

30:29.528 --> 30:32.262
I believe that person
deliberately placed the letter

30:32.264 --> 30:34.665
in Mr. Lovecraft's
room to incriminate him.

30:34.667 --> 30:39.536
Now who was it?

30:44.577 --> 30:47.311
Let's go, George.

31:08.500 --> 31:10.500
- Thomas.
- Hm...

31:10.502 --> 31:13.036
I believe I will come in
to work with you tomorrow.

31:13.038 --> 31:15.572
<i>- Why?</i>
- I can't stay home alone.

31:15.574 --> 31:18.041
He's everywhere.

31:28.053 --> 31:31.255
Ah, Murdoch. Where are we at?

31:31.257 --> 31:34.191
Well sir, I--
Oh! Mrs. Brackenreid!

31:34.193 --> 31:36.793
Margaret insisted on
coming in with me today,

31:36.795 --> 31:39.963
despite Mr. Lovecraft no longer
posing any threat to her.

31:39.965 --> 31:42.466
Murdoch, I can't stress

31:42.468 --> 31:44.234
how vital it is
that you wrap this case up.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.305
Yes, sir. In fact, I--

31:48.307 --> 31:52.075
Excuse me.
Inspector Thomas Brackenreid...

31:52.077 --> 31:54.611
Could you speak up?

31:54.613 --> 31:57.681
- I can't hear you.
<i>- Is the detective there?</i>

32:02.321 --> 32:04.955
- Detective Murdoch.
<i>- It's Sarah Glass.</i>

32:04.957 --> 32:07.724
<i>I think I know
something important.</i>

32:07.726 --> 32:09.893
<i>That letter you were
asking about...</i>

32:09.895 --> 32:12.462
Yes, Miss Glass?

32:12.464 --> 32:15.632
<i>You are back already!
No! Wait!</i>

32:15.634 --> 32:17.834
Miss Glass, are you there?

32:19.939 --> 32:23.407
Miss Glass, are you alright?

32:23.409 --> 32:25.842
Hello? HELLO?!

32:25.844 --> 32:28.612
Who is there?

32:34.653 --> 32:37.354
W-- What just happened?

32:46.198 --> 32:48.131
- Explain yourselves.
- We just got home,

32:48.133 --> 32:49.900
we found her
like this. I swear it.

32:49.902 --> 32:52.736
We were buying tobacco.

32:52.738 --> 32:56.073
- Where is Logan Smiley?
- I don't know,

32:56.075 --> 32:58.742
he was still here
with her when we left.

32:58.744 --> 33:00.911
She was trying to tell us
something over the telephone.

33:00.913 --> 33:04.481
- What was it?
- I don't know, sir. Honest.

33:09.955 --> 33:13.390
What happened? Sarah...

33:13.392 --> 33:15.592
Where have you
been, Mr. Smiley?

33:15.594 --> 33:17.427
I w-- I was
at the cemetery.

33:17.429 --> 33:20.130
- Doing what?
- Worshipping the dead.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.933
Can anyone
corroborate this?

33:22.935 --> 33:25.936
- And don't say the bloody dead.
- Perhaps the gravedigger.

33:25.938 --> 33:28.105
- Are you trying to be funny?
- No.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.440
What happened to her?

33:30.442 --> 33:33.577
One of you lot
killed her.

33:36.949 --> 33:39.549
Sir, Logan Smiley was indeed

33:39.551 --> 33:41.451
wandering the cemetery
grounds at the time

33:41.453 --> 33:44.254
- of Miss Glass' murder.
- And Mr. Lovecraft

33:44.256 --> 33:46.490
was here in our cells.
What of the other two?

33:46.492 --> 33:49.226
Well, that's where it gets
interesting, sir. The shopkeeper

33:49.228 --> 33:52.162
confirmed that Ian Blair did
indeed buy tobacco off him.

33:52.164 --> 33:54.765
He even noted the time as he
was about to close for lunch.

33:54.767 --> 33:57.100
But he said Mr. Hartley
wasn't with him.

33:57.102 --> 34:00.337
So, the two of them
left Mr. Smiley's together,

34:00.339 --> 34:03.507
leaving Miss Glass behind,
but then Mr. Hartley

34:03.509 --> 34:06.009
turned back to prevent her
from speaking with us.

34:06.011 --> 34:08.277
Right, then. I'll
pick up Clinton Hartley.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.580
Thank you, George.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.983
<i>Tell me again:</i>
Where were you

34:12.985 --> 34:15.485
at twelve-forty PM,
Mr. Hartley?

34:15.487 --> 34:18.989
That's around when Ian
and I went for tobacco.

34:18.991 --> 34:21.324
You were never
with Mr. Blair

34:21.326 --> 34:25.062
at the tobacco shop
as you initially claimed.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.764
I was.

34:32.971 --> 34:35.472
I can even show you...

34:35.474 --> 34:37.940
the purchase receipt.

34:46.784 --> 34:50.053
Surely given to you
by your best friend.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.621
You see,
the shopkeep confirmed

34:52.623 --> 34:54.824
that Mr. Blair did
indeed come in and purchase

34:54.827 --> 34:58.495
tobacco from him.
But not you.

35:00.432 --> 35:02.732
I waited outside.

35:02.734 --> 35:04.568
The shopkeep also said

35:04.570 --> 35:07.104
that this was
the last transaction

35:07.106 --> 35:09.773
before closing for lunch.
He stepped outside,

35:09.775 --> 35:12.342
locked the door and saw
Mr. Blair walking away...

35:12.344 --> 35:15.378
alone.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.581
No.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.584
You returned to the house
shortly after leaving

35:20.586 --> 35:24.087
and found Miss Glass
on the telephone.

35:24.089 --> 35:26.456
There was something

35:26.458 --> 35:28.758
Miss Glass needed
to say to me.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.528
Very likely that it was you

35:31.530 --> 35:35.465
she saw planting the love
letter in Mr. Lovecraft's room.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.767
I didn't.

35:37.769 --> 35:40.504
So, you murdered her...

35:40.506 --> 35:42.706
with the nearest
implement at hand.

35:42.708 --> 35:46.076
The telephone.

35:46.078 --> 35:49.246
My father's
going to kill me.

35:52.851 --> 35:56.453
It was you that was in a
relationship with Miss Woods.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.724
And you murdered Miss Glass
to conceal the fact

36:00.726 --> 36:03.927
that you had murdered
your own sweetheart.

36:03.929 --> 36:06.596
Why?

36:06.598 --> 36:09.432
Why kill your own sweetheart?

36:11.436 --> 36:13.904
I don't know.

36:13.906 --> 36:15.906
You loved her,

36:15.908 --> 36:19.876
but I am told
that you fought frequently?

36:21.613 --> 36:23.613
Yes.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.550
I know you smothered her...

36:26.552 --> 36:28.985
but, uh...

36:28.987 --> 36:31.221
where did the blood come from

36:31.223 --> 36:33.056
that covered her dress
and the handkerchief

36:33.058 --> 36:36.860
that was found at the scene?
Because it wasn't <i>her</i> blood.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.864
I can't recall.

36:40.866 --> 36:44.434
Not something
one would easily forget.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.577
While I was smothering her,

36:53.579 --> 36:57.080
she threw her head back,
and it struck my nose.

36:57.082 --> 37:00.150
I used the same handkerchief
to stop the bleeding.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.388
A confession isn't
good enough for you?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.457
The one for
Miss Glass's murder is.

37:07.459 --> 37:10.894
- What about Miss Woods?
- Clinton Hartley claims

37:10.896 --> 37:13.129
that he used the handkerchief
that was found at the scene

37:13.131 --> 37:15.532
- to stop his bleeding nose.
- So?

37:15.534 --> 37:18.068
That handkerchief
was doused in chloroform.

37:18.070 --> 37:20.904
It would have knocked him out
as surely as it did Miss Woods.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.340
He couldn't possibly
have held it to his nose.

37:23.342 --> 37:25.709
- Only the killer would know it.
- Therefore,

37:25.711 --> 37:27.877
her sweetheart could not
have been Clinton Hartley.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.780
William, I found
something interesting.

37:30.782 --> 37:33.750
I checked in on Mr. Lovecraft,
and he shared his new notebook

37:33.752 --> 37:36.019
- with me.
- More bloody drawings?

37:36.021 --> 37:37.887
No, Inspector, he wrote
a detailed account

37:37.889 --> 37:41.758
of his experience of late. Quite
a fine writer it turns out.

37:41.760 --> 37:44.494
Does it have any
bearing on our case?

37:44.496 --> 37:47.063
Well, the letter you found
in his room? What we perceived

37:47.065 --> 37:49.733
simply as a love letter,
he perceived as something

37:49.735 --> 37:54.271
much more. Mr. Lovecraft
believes it was written to Ian.

37:54.273 --> 37:57.574
Yes,

37:57.576 --> 37:59.776
they were in love.

37:59.778 --> 38:02.679
But they also planned
to meet on the other side.

38:02.681 --> 38:06.216
- The other side?
- The other side of life.

38:06.218 --> 38:10.120
- Death.
- Yes.

38:12.524 --> 38:16.493
- "Together we shall go."
- "For never was there a story

38:16.495 --> 38:19.929
of more woe than ours."
You recognize the passage?

38:19.931 --> 38:22.599
Yes. I love when you
read Shakespeare to me.

38:22.601 --> 38:25.101
- It's <i>Romeo and Juliet!</i>
- And what did Romeo

38:25.103 --> 38:27.103
and Juliet do?

38:27.105 --> 38:30.307
They both committed
suicide in the name of love.

38:30.309 --> 38:32.842
Precisely.
Not only is this

38:32.844 --> 38:35.045
a veiled suicide note,

38:35.047 --> 38:37.047
but it's a suicide pact

38:37.049 --> 38:39.149
between two
star-crossed lovers.

38:39.151 --> 38:41.651
How I envy them.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.791
Yet only one body
was found at the scene.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.993
But what of all that blood?

39:04.609 --> 39:08.678
I will be with you
soon, my love.

39:20.992 --> 39:24.561
Ian! Ian! No! Please!

39:28.367 --> 39:31.134
Don't leave me.

39:36.007 --> 39:39.743
You're under arrest for the
murder of Miss Ellen Woods.

39:43.915 --> 39:47.417
- I miss her so.
- Don't say anything, Ian!

39:51.156 --> 39:53.723
I cannot stand
to be without her.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.860
The pendant.

39:56.862 --> 39:59.896
May I take it
with me to the gallows

39:59.898 --> 40:02.332
so that I may give it to her
again once we are reunited

40:02.334 --> 40:04.701
on the other side?

40:16.314 --> 40:19.682
I suppose being a youth isn't
as simple as it used to be.

40:23.188 --> 40:25.155
Was it ever
simple, William?

40:25.157 --> 40:27.390
Think about our friends
Romeo and Juliet.

40:27.392 --> 40:30.260
Indeed.

40:35.167 --> 40:38.768
Hmm. It's really about salvation.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.938
Ha! Take that,
Verna Jones!

41:11.937 --> 41:14.404
"How blessed are some,

41:14.406 --> 41:17.740
"whose lives have
no fears, no dreads.

41:17.742 --> 41:20.410
"To whom sleep comes
nightly and brings nothing

41:20.412 --> 41:24.347
- but sweet dreams."
- What do you want?

41:26.284 --> 41:28.818
You look
beautiful, my dear.

41:45.203 --> 41:48.638
- SHUSH, SHUSH! BLOODY HELL!
- I had a horrible nightmare,

41:48.640 --> 41:51.274
Thomas. I had blood
coming down my eyes!

41:51.276 --> 41:53.643
- I had tentacles in my hair!
- Shh!

41:53.645 --> 41:56.012
It's that bloody book
you're reading before bedtime!

41:56.014 --> 41:58.147
- Stop reading it!
- It wasn't the book,

41:58.149 --> 42:00.383
- it was Mr. Lovecraft.
- Don't you worry

42:00.385 --> 42:03.653
about Mr. Lovecraft. He's going
back to Providence tomorrow.

42:03.655 --> 42:07.624
Even so, he's in
my mind. He's in my soul!

42:07.626 --> 42:09.893
He's not in your mind,
and he's not in your soul.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.762
Just go back
to sleep, yeah? Go on.

42:23.308 --> 42:26.709
Best of luck in
Providence, Mr. Lovecraft!

42:26.711 --> 42:30.179
- You are missing a button.
- Keep your nose clean, son.

42:30.181 --> 42:32.882
I plan to concentrate
on my writing upon my return.

42:32.884 --> 42:36.252
Mr. Crabtree offered
some useful encouragement.

42:36.254 --> 42:38.655
I do wonder what it would
be like to look at the world

42:38.657 --> 42:40.757
through his eyes
instead of mine.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.559
But I fear
that will never be.

42:42.561 --> 42:44.561
Well, don't let that
discourage you.

42:44.563 --> 42:47.630
You keep at it.
Take care, Mr. Lovecraft.

42:56.641 --> 42:58.975
Would you give
this to her?

43:05.450 --> 43:08.184
Everything alright, sir?

43:11.022 --> 43:13.256
Margaret can never
know of this.
