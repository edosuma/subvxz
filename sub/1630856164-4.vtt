Man! (chuckles)

This kind of action
makes me feel alive.

00:10.301 --> 00:12.178
This kind of action makes
me feel nauseous.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.347
Oh, come on,
at the end of the day,

00:14.431 --> 00:16.474
we're all gamblers, am I right?

00:16.516 --> 00:18.184
No, you're not right.
We're the house.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.020
House doesn't gamble.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.230
That's why we're called "the
house," not "the soup kitchen."

00:22.313 --> 00:23.648
I can't shake
the feeling that this guy

00:23.732 --> 00:25.525
knows more about this
than we do.

00:25.608 --> 00:27.652
Why else would he make a stupid
fuckin' bet like that?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.279
Because he's on tilt.

00:29.320 --> 00:31.364
We've all seen this
a thousand times.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.533
It just happens
to be a higher number.

00:33.616 --> 00:35.618
Yeah, 1.4 million.

Okay, so the first thing you see

00:52.886 --> 00:54.846

00:56.806 --> 00:59.184
"Board-certified" is a keeper.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.685
I'm not sure about "shaman."

01:00.727 --> 01:02.187
You're the one
who pitched "shaman."

01:02.270 --> 01:03.563
I know.
We'll find a place for it.

Okay, let's take a crack at
some Frequently Asked Questions.

01:42.394 --> 01:44.479
Number one you got to figure is,

01:44.562 --> 01:48.525
"How much does
microdosing therapy cost?"

01:48.566 --> 01:50.527
Answer.

"How can you put a price
on freedom?"

-Right. (grunts)

Chiefs, Tampa, quick.

01:58.283 --> 02:00.578
Got it. 917, go.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.414
I can't, they're already
kicked off already.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.624
I'm looking right at it.
Turn on your fucking TV.

02:04.708 --> 02:07.085
Green Bay? Nah, man,
Green Bay already played.

02:07.168 --> 02:09.253
Oh, okay, got you, Tampa Bay.

02:09.294 --> 02:11.715
No, motherfucker,
you said Green Bay.

Yes, you did.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.898
Well, if it's not there,
then you skipped a step.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.984
What's your operating system?

02:31.067 --> 02:33.528
AT&T is your phone, numbnuts.

02:33.611 --> 02:35.822

Camp Lejeune water.

Heat and Grizzlies over,
220 and a half. You're down.

03:11.649 --> 03:13.276
Spurs plus five. You're down.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.903
Capitals minus 115,

03:14.986 --> 03:17.197

03:24.829 --> 03:26.289
How's the online action?

03:26.331 --> 03:27.707
We're way up on the early games.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.501
You could make the Raiders
minus a thousand,

03:29.584 --> 03:31.503
every cholo would still bet 'em.

03:31.544 --> 03:32.796
Yo, brother,
you seeing these numbers?

03:32.837 --> 03:35.256
-I see it. Terrific.
-That's it?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.091
-What? I'm happy.
-Tell your fuckin' face.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.177
-Don't start with me, please.
-Sorry. I'll just tell you

03:39.260 --> 03:40.512
when we're losing.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.348
Sisters, huh?

03:43.390 --> 03:44.974
I grew up with four of 'em.

03:45.016 --> 03:47.477
When my mom was at work,
they'd dress me up like a girl,

03:47.519 --> 03:49.938
and make me dance for cookies.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.858
-Lorraine,
can you do me a favor?
-Hmm?

03:53.942 --> 03:56.444
-Mm.
-Check out a guy named Jack Han?

03:56.528 --> 03:58.238
-Hand?
-No, no D, just Han.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.739
-Han.
-Right, Han.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.157
Hang on.

04:01.199 --> 04:02.951
Tell me again
we're gonna be okay.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.203
-I never told you that.
-Well, lie to me.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.580
You know just as well as I do,
it's any given Sunday.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.583
Yeah, but the Texans are
a nine-point dog.

04:10.667 --> 04:13.003
He bet 'em to win outright.

04:13.044 --> 04:14.462
Can I tell you a story?

04:14.546 --> 04:16.297
-Can I hear it?
-No.

04:17.548 --> 04:18.966
When I was with the Chargers,

04:19.050 --> 04:21.553
we were huge favorites
against the Titans.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.304
Knocked their starting
quarterback out,

04:23.388 --> 04:25.682
destroyed the backup, by the
time the fourth quarter rolled

04:25.724 --> 04:27.475
around, the damn punter
was throwing passes.

04:27.559 --> 04:29.310
Could that be the end
of the story, please?

04:29.394 --> 04:30.979
-We lost.
-LORRAINE: Jack Han.

04:31.062 --> 04:33.773
-Genghis Han sneakers?
-What you got?

04:33.857 --> 04:37.068
Company trades
on the Hong Kong exchange.

04:37.152 --> 04:38.445
Produced a couple
of slasher films.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.863
None of 'em made any money.

04:39.904 --> 04:41.156
Okay. Thanks for looking.

04:41.239 --> 04:42.824
-Oh.
-What?

04:42.907 --> 04:44.534
Director on the last one,
he fell off a boat and drowned.

04:44.576 --> 04:46.494
Never found the body.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.914
Okay, thank you.

04:50.957 --> 04:53.710
-Hector, check it out.
-DANNY: Can you swim?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.380
We got our first customer.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.799
Dr. Colavito, I presume.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.260
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Where you going?

05:02.344 --> 05:04.929
I'm gonna take my wife out to
dinner and tell her I love her.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.848
(laughing)

05:06.931 --> 05:08.308
I'm serious.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.359
-(entry bell chimes)
-Hey.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.818
Hey.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.945
-(soft music playing)
-Place looks good.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.280
Thanks.

05:22.322 --> 05:24.824
The music is a nice touch.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.580
$195. Not exactly
priced to move.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.791
That's blown glass
from Murano, Italy

05:32.874 --> 05:34.501
and they're flying
off the shelf.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.960
Maybe in an earthquake.

05:36.044 --> 05:37.962
Did you just come down here
to bust my balls?

05:38.046 --> 05:40.090
Yeah.

05:40.131 --> 05:43.426
Miss Ellaneous made
$42,000 this week.

05:43.468 --> 05:46.554
Oh, look at that.
Good for me.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.931
Yeah, and I thought
maybe I could take

05:47.972 --> 05:49.432
my wife and stepson
out for dinner.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.893
What about
the Sunday night game?

05:51.976 --> 05:53.311
I got it covered.

05:53.353 --> 05:55.480
-(chuckles softly)
-What do you say?

05:56.398 --> 05:59.109
Sounds great,
except for you-know-who.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.820
It's just a phase,
he'll come around.

06:01.861 --> 06:04.322
If it wasn't for Frosted Flakes
and peanut butter and jelly,

06:04.406 --> 06:06.199
I'm afraid he'd starve to death.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.200
(sighs)
Call him.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.536
Anthony!

06:10.829 --> 06:12.330
What?

06:12.414 --> 06:14.290
We're gonna go out for dinner.
What do you feel like eating?

06:14.332 --> 06:16.042
I'm not hungry.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.253
I know, your mom and I are.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.921
Pick something.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.506
PB and J.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.466
Pick again.
And don't say cereal.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.219
Maybe spaghetti.

06:26.302 --> 06:27.429
Great.

06:27.512 --> 06:29.222
-(chuckles)
-Plain spaghetti.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.516
-Fine.
-With ketchup.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.561
-Sold.
-(chuckling)

06:34.644 --> 06:36.855
-Let's roll.
-Oh, right now?

06:36.896 --> 06:39.941
Unless you're waiting
for a late rush.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.655
Grandma!

06:46.406 --> 06:47.991
(keys jingle)

06:49.200 --> 06:50.534
Hello?

06:50.618 --> 06:52.829
GRANDMA:
In the kitchen, little boy.

06:52.871 --> 06:53.872
Little boy?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.623
When did I become "little boy"?

06:55.707 --> 06:56.624
(laughter nearby)

06:56.707 --> 06:58.460
MAN:
Glory be.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.627
Oh. Hey.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.339
Rayfield, meet John Franklin,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.549
an old dear friend of mine.

07:04.632 --> 07:07.135
-Call me Frank.
-How you doing, Frank?

07:07.218 --> 07:08.553
(sighs)

07:08.636 --> 07:10.555
You did good, Marion.

07:11.473 --> 07:13.558
-He did not make it easy.
-(chuckles)

07:13.600 --> 07:17.979
I hope you understand what kind
of special lady you got here.

07:18.063 --> 07:19.397
Oh. (chuckles)

07:19.439 --> 07:22.609
It's true.
You are one of a kind.

07:22.692 --> 07:25.695
Frank and I used to be neighbors
when you were a baby.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.740
Long, long time ago.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.784
He and his wife
often watched after you

07:30.867 --> 07:32.327
when I worked a double shift.

07:32.409 --> 07:34.371
Francine couldn't conceive,

07:34.412 --> 07:36.206
so you filled
a big hole in our lives.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.499
Francine was his wife.

07:37.582 --> 07:40.085
God rest her soul.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.169
She passed.

07:41.252 --> 07:42.462
49 years we were together.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.590
Frank and Francine. Glory be.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.050
I'm so sorry.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.552
-When did she pass?
-Week ago Thursday.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.222
Glory be.

07:52.263 --> 07:53.848
JOHN:
Mm-hmm.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.937
(phone buzzing)

08:05.318 --> 08:06.444
What's wrong?

08:06.528 --> 08:09.114
I know what Jack's edge is.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.949
Hang on.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.952
-SANDRA: What's going on?
-Go back to sleep.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.495
Okay.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.957
-Go.
-I did a little digging

08:18.998 --> 08:21.626
to see why Jack would pick
the Texans to win outright.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.504
GRANDMA:
You're so bad. (laughing)

08:24.587 --> 08:26.464
Oh, for fuck's sake.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.174
Sorry.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.303
So I called an old buddy of mine
from Brigham Young,

08:32.345 --> 08:34.014
who's currently on
the New York coaching staff.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.140
-DANNY: Yeah.
-He's a bit of a gossip.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.308
-Nice.
-Particularly
when he's drinking.

08:38.393 --> 08:39.477
Loving it.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.479
Oh, Mormons and alcohol.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.565
Turns out
a large unattractive man

08:43.648 --> 08:44.858
who plays on the offensive line

08:44.941 --> 08:47.485
has a personal issue

08:47.527 --> 08:50.447
with a handsome player who plays
a more glamorous position.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.990
What kind of issue?

08:52.032 --> 08:53.533
The "you shouldn't be
fucking my wife" kind.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.660
Jesus Christ.

08:55.744 --> 08:57.996
So the big ugly
is looking for payback.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.498
-Wouldn't you?
-It's gonna be like a turnstile.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.334
"Right this way, sir."

09:02.375 --> 09:03.668
They'll need a spatula

09:03.752 --> 09:05.378
to scrape the New York QB
off the field.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.671
Well, what about the backup?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.465
Rookie. Played at Kutztown.

09:08.506 --> 09:09.549
What's Kutztown?

09:09.632 --> 09:10.800
Exactly.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.886
All right, so what's our move?

09:12.969 --> 09:16.139
I guess we got to deal Walt in,
tell him what we know.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.141
Sounds right.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.559
GRANDMA:
Damn it, Frank, slow down.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.353
Yeah, Frank, slow down!

09:21.394 --> 09:23.188
What? What's going on?
Who the hell's Frank?

09:23.271 --> 09:25.023
My old babysitter.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.107
What?

09:26.149 --> 09:27.192
WALT:
Still.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.818
Doesn't mean
it's not a good bet.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.862
I mean, the guy's
a professional athlete.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.530
His teammate schtupped his wife.

09:32.614 --> 09:36.368
So ergo,
he's not gonna do his job?

09:36.409 --> 09:37.911
Ray, back me up.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.538
These guys get evaluated on film
every Monday, right?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.749
People miss blocks all the time,
even when they're trying.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.292
You'd know.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.003
Fuck. This is on me.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.421
What're you talking about?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.923
I jinxed us.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.508
I went and looked
at an Aston Martin yesterday.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.801
-(both groaning)
-Oh, fuck.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.010
I put the whammy
on this whole deal.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.720
I'm sorry.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.309
(sighs)
So...

10:01.393 --> 10:02.936
what's our play?

10:06.481 --> 10:10.068
I say we go to Jack
and tell him we're out.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.153
(ragged groan)

10:12.237 --> 10:13.530
Yeah, I suppose.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.948
I mean, what's he gonna do?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.616
Report us to
the Better Business Bureau?

10:16.700 --> 10:19.494
No way.
No fucking way, Jose!

10:19.577 --> 10:22.789
You don't get to cancel my bet
just because you feel like it.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.749
There's still eight hours
before kickoff.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.584
That's plenty of time
to find another book.

10:26.668 --> 10:27.961
We'll even cover your vig.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.922
No vig!
I don't pay no fucking vig!

10:32.298 --> 10:34.801
You're just chickenshit 'cause
you know I have a sure thing.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.302
Come on, Jack.

10:36.386 --> 10:37.929
You know there are
no sure things in the NFL.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.097
I'm sure.

10:39.180 --> 10:40.432
You give football players
free sneakers,

10:40.515 --> 10:42.434
and they will tell you things.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.935
I know.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.937
What about you, huh?
Why are you so quiet?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.230
No--

10:47.272 --> 10:50.066
Oh, I'm just as disappointed
as you are, Jack,

10:50.108 --> 10:52.360
but I have to respect
my chickenshit partners.

10:54.696 --> 10:56.614
Okay, okay, let's...

10:56.698 --> 10:59.784
Let's all put on
our thinking caps.

11:06.624 --> 11:07.709
I got it.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.879
Oh, great. He's got it.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.299
You keep your word,
and you take my bet,

11:14.341 --> 11:18.428
and I don't take all of you
fishing on my boat.

11:20.805 --> 11:23.767
What does fishing have to do
with anything?

11:24.642 --> 11:26.311
(whispering)

11:26.353 --> 11:27.979
Oh.

11:29.647 --> 11:31.066
You're threatening us?

11:31.858 --> 11:33.902
Yes. Are you stupid?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.406
What? (stammers)

11:38.490 --> 11:40.158
I don't understand.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.993
Fishing sounds kind of fun.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.252
So, um,

11:51.336 --> 11:54.172
have you formed an intention
for your psychedelic journey?

11:54.214 --> 11:57.842
Oh, an intention?
Uh, I don't understand.

11:57.884 --> 12:00.345
People come to Dr. Colavito

12:00.428 --> 12:01.846
for a variety of reasons.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.308
They want to overcome
anxiety, depression...

12:05.350 --> 12:09.062
Of course, there's career
problems, relationship problems.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.814
It's nothing like that.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.066
Oh. Then what?

12:13.149 --> 12:15.485
I...

12:15.527 --> 12:17.529
I have six months to live.

12:18.738 --> 12:19.906
They say six.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.367
I think that's optimistic.

12:23.368 --> 12:24.536
I'm so sorry.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.204
It's okay, sweetie.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.416
You do understand there's no
pain relief with shrooms, right?

12:29.499 --> 12:31.626
-I know.
-Okay.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.545
And I'm okay with the pain.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.714
I mean, I'm taking
more pills than Elvis.

12:35.797 --> 12:37.841
(laughs)

12:37.882 --> 12:40.260
What I want is to find
some comfort

12:40.343 --> 12:41.761
in...

12:43.304 --> 12:44.681
...not existing.

12:44.723 --> 12:47.434
-Not existing?
-You know.

12:47.517 --> 12:49.060
Fade to black.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.564
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.065
You get it.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.776
Well, you came to
the right place.

12:56.860 --> 12:58.737
Yeah.
(chuckles)

12:58.820 --> 13:00.488
(sighs)

13:00.572 --> 13:02.907
Slide! Slide!

13:02.991 --> 13:07.120
Don't be a hero.
Don't be a hero.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.581
That son of a bitch's
got wheels.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.583
Son of a bitch shouldn't have
fucked his left tackle's wife.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.918
You guys got a minute to talk
about the deep fryers?

13:14.002 --> 13:16.796
-Not right now, Petey.
-Excuse me,

13:16.880 --> 13:18.423
when I gave you
a piece of this place,

13:18.506 --> 13:19.758
I didn't just give you

13:19.799 --> 13:21.176
a piece of the glitz
and the glamour.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.969
There happens to be
ongoing maintenance.

13:23.053 --> 13:24.804
You didn't give us a piece.
You lost a piece.

13:24.888 --> 13:26.890
Potato, potato.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.183
When'd you start smoking?

13:28.266 --> 13:30.769
-20 minutes ago.
-Well, don't get cancer.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.812
Your dirty money is the only
thing keeping this joint going.

13:32.896 --> 13:34.064
Nice to know you care.

13:34.105 --> 13:35.482
While I have you both,

13:35.565 --> 13:37.567
the walk-in cooler is also
on its last legs.

13:37.609 --> 13:40.570
Can we please not deal
with this right now, man?

13:40.612 --> 13:42.447
Oh!
(chuckles)

13:42.489 --> 13:44.866
Got your ass hanging out
on tonight's game?

13:44.949 --> 13:47.452
-Little bit.
-PETEY: Oh, yeah.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.537
Your heart's beating
a mile a minute.

13:49.621 --> 13:51.956
Not enough spit in your mouth
to lick an envelope.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.833
Drive stalled out at the 30.
Settled for three.

13:53.917 --> 13:55.460
BOTH:
Yes!

13:56.920 --> 13:58.797
Now can we talk about
the deep fryers?

13:58.838 --> 13:59.881
BOTH:
No!

13:59.964 --> 14:02.467
Ah, fuck youse both.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.845
(exhales)
Oh, my God.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.640
What's happening?

14:08.682 --> 14:11.601
I just had an orgasm.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.438
Oh, well... good for you.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.649
I'll say.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.360
Would either of you
happen to have a Camel Filter?

14:21.403 --> 14:22.487
What's that?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.156
Oh, it's before your time.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.325
It's the brand my hu...

14:29.202 --> 14:32.205
...my husband smoked.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.000
(crying)

14:35.083 --> 14:37.293
Buckle up.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.378
(sniffles)

14:38.461 --> 14:41.798
35 years
I was married to that man.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.466
(exhales)

14:43.508 --> 14:44.968
Right before he died,

14:45.010 --> 14:48.054
he turned to me and said,
"I love you, Sharon."

14:48.138 --> 14:49.681
(smacks lips)
Aw...

14:49.764 --> 14:51.850
My name's Eileen.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.601
Oh.

14:53.685 --> 14:54.728
It happened.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.855
Quarterback went down hard.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.148
They cut away to a commercial.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.441
They didn't even want to
show the replay.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.693
-He's out?
-He's a grease stain.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.861
So, Kutztown is in?

15:02.902 --> 15:04.779
Kutztown is in.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.573
Light a candle.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.285
Do you think we could work out

15:10.368 --> 15:11.786
some kind of installment plan
with Jack?

15:11.828 --> 15:12.912
Something to discuss
on the boat.

15:12.996 --> 15:14.330
-(scoffs)
-Oh...

15:14.372 --> 15:16.958
-Well, well.
-Fuck. Go away.

15:17.042 --> 15:18.877
Oh, would that I could.

15:18.918 --> 15:23.131
You guys know an avid sports
enthusiast named Jack Han?

15:23.214 --> 15:24.966
-Hand?
-Han. No D.

15:25.050 --> 15:26.843
-Han.
-Han.
-Yeah, Han.

15:26.885 --> 15:28.303
-No.
-Sorry.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.971
Interesting. You're both
wearing his sneakers.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.142
Oh, that's embarrassing.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.186
Jesus, Danny.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.187
Why won't you let me help you?

15:37.228 --> 15:38.605
Why do I need your help?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.148
For reasons that are
above my pay grade,

15:40.231 --> 15:42.859
Mr. Han-- no D--
has diplomatic immunity.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.027
Which means what to us?

15:44.069 --> 15:46.237
Assuming we know him?

15:46.279 --> 15:48.490
Which means he can
kill a bookie in the afternoon

15:48.573 --> 15:50.909
and still sit courtside
at a Lakers game that night.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.578
-Thanks for clearing that up.
-CARL: Mm-hmm. Point being,

15:53.661 --> 15:57.415
if you should cross paths,
walk the other way.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.167
Kutztown's got his head up his--

16:00.585 --> 16:02.420
Hi, how are you?

16:02.504 --> 16:03.922
Great.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.590
Good, good, good, good,
good, good.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.677
Good. Good, good, good.
See ya.

16:10.804 --> 16:13.056
(sobbing)

16:14.224 --> 16:16.101
How much did you give her?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.686
What it said
on the YouTube video,

16:17.769 --> 16:19.104
one-tenth a full dose.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.897
-You sure?
-Yeah.

16:20.939 --> 16:24.234
I mean, I don't know
what a full dose is, but yeah.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.528
(Eileen crying)

16:27.320 --> 16:30.198
Maybe it's mixing
with something else?

16:30.281 --> 16:34.452
Eileen, what other drugs
are you taking?

16:34.536 --> 16:36.663
Oh...

16:39.499 --> 16:41.376
Okay, every drug.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.629
Oh, my God.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.922
Another orgasm?

16:45.964 --> 16:47.549
Better.

16:49.134 --> 16:51.594
It all makes sense now.
(chuckles softly)

16:51.636 --> 16:53.638
-It does?
-Yes.

16:53.722 --> 16:55.807
I-I-I've had a good life.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.809
My children are good people.

16:57.892 --> 17:01.146
My marriage... Ah.

17:01.980 --> 17:02.981
My time is done.

17:03.064 --> 17:04.983
I've, I've fulfilled my purpose.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.984
There's no reason to be afraid.

17:07.068 --> 17:10.195
That's wonderful.
I'm so happy for you.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.781
Thank you both so much.

17:11.823 --> 17:14.075
This is more
than I could've hoped for.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.493
-You're welcome.
-That's why we do it.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.665
Do you mind
if I use your restroom,

17:21.750 --> 17:22.876
just to freshen up?

17:22.959 --> 17:24.377
Of course.

17:28.506 --> 17:29.507
We did it.

17:30.342 --> 17:32.302
-We changed that woman's life.
-I know.

17:32.344 --> 17:34.012
I've never felt this good
about myself. Ever.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.056
(laughs)

17:36.139 --> 17:37.599
(thud nearby)

17:39.059 --> 17:40.018
Oh, God.

17:40.101 --> 17:42.187
Stay in the hug.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.691
You don't think Jack's
gonna kill us, right?

17:46.775 --> 17:48.651
Just wants his money.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.987
Somehow we'll pay it.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.864
It will just clean us out.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.366
Starting over.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.993
I've done it before,
I'll do it again.

17:57.994 --> 18:01.706
(scoffs) Just got to figure out
how I'm gonna tell Sharise.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.751
And Janelle.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.252
And Brook.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.547
What do I tell Sandra?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.842
Probably have to give up
that dumb gift shop,

18:12.884 --> 18:15.387
which she loves more than me.

18:15.470 --> 18:17.472
Have to send Anthony
to public school.

18:17.555 --> 18:19.391
Like he's not
fucked up enough now.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.893
Grandma's never going
back to Brentwood.

18:21.976 --> 18:26.147
We dared to dream, Ray.
We dared to dream.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.526
(cheering and whooping inside)

18:29.567 --> 18:31.277
There it is.

18:31.361 --> 18:33.238
It's been a pleasure.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.240
WALT:
Holy Al Michaels!

18:35.281 --> 18:37.575
Do you believe in miracles?

18:37.659 --> 18:39.119
We won?

18:39.202 --> 18:42.914
Kutztown threw a Hail Mary,
and Mary fucking caught it!

18:42.956 --> 18:45.250
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

18:45.333 --> 18:47.419
We won? We fucking won!

18:47.460 --> 18:49.129
-(shouting)
-Yes! Yes!

18:49.212 --> 18:51.172
I'm so hard right now!

18:51.256 --> 18:54.259
(laughing, whooping)

18:54.300 --> 18:55.969
(cheering over TV)

18:56.052 --> 18:57.262
(TV turns off)

18:59.014 --> 19:00.348
(sighs)

19:00.432 --> 19:03.059
I'm going to need
ice cream and a blow job.

19:03.101 --> 19:05.145
(ragged exhale)

19:14.863 --> 19:16.531
Thank you.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.791
You ever tried one of these
with a little red wine?

19:30.920 --> 19:32.464
Ring the bell
when you're finished.

19:32.547 --> 19:35.300
-Thank you, Greg.
-It's Gregory.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.344
Sorry. Gregory.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.434
You're right.

19:44.476 --> 19:45.477
He's definitely
fucking with kids.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.563
Oh, yeah, he's a diddler.

19:48.646 --> 19:50.106
You gonna tell your sister
about this money?

19:50.148 --> 19:51.441
Nope. You gonna tell her?

19:51.483 --> 19:53.485
-Wasn't planning on it.
-Good man.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.612
What about Sandra?

19:55.653 --> 19:58.406
Our relationship's
complicated enough.

20:01.826 --> 20:04.162
You do realize this is our
chance to run away together.

20:04.245 --> 20:06.998
I thought you'd never ask.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.958
We're gonna need a bigger box.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.380
Oh, Gregory!
