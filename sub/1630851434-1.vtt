00:06.000 --> 00:07.916
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:14.250 --> 00:15.875
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

00:43.833 --> 00:45.916
Mom, what is that? A drawing?

00:46.000 --> 00:47.333
Come here, honey.

00:47.416 --> 00:49.625
We could at least go watch a movie.

00:49.708 --> 00:52.625
I saw a great one.
But I'd watch it again with you.

00:52.708 --> 00:55.250
-What movie is that?
-Samson Against--

00:55.333 --> 00:57.750
No. I prefer comedies.

00:57.833 --> 01:01.791
But there's no violence.
Maybe a couple of brawls at the most.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.708
If you're afraid, you can put
your head on my shoulder.

01:04.791 --> 01:06.583
Why don't you ask my friend there?

01:06.666 --> 01:09.541
She even liked Samson against the Sheik.

01:09.625 --> 01:12.291
Yes, but I want
to go out with you, not her.

01:12.375 --> 01:14.500
-Tomorrow?
-I'm busy.

01:14.583 --> 01:15.416
The day after?

01:16.416 --> 01:17.833
-A rat!
-Where?

01:17.916 --> 01:20.375
-Oh my God! Gross!
-It's under the towel.

01:20.458 --> 01:21.291
-Here?
-Yes.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.250
-There's nothing there.
-I saw it!

01:23.333 --> 01:25.416
-Where did you see it?
-Earlier.

01:25.500 --> 01:26.791
-Here?
-Yes.

01:28.708 --> 01:30.916
-Are you sure it was a rat?
-Yes.

01:35.291 --> 01:37.291
Where is that damn rat?

01:37.375 --> 01:39.666
Considering what you charge for a soda,

01:39.750 --> 01:42.125
you could pay more attention to hygiene!

02:04.000 --> 02:05.458
This is the last one.

02:05.541 --> 02:07.750
2,000 lire for this lump of plastic?

02:07.833 --> 02:09.083
This won't scare anyone.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.833
What else can I do, ma'am?

02:10.916 --> 02:12.583
-Just go.
-Goodbye.

02:13.291 --> 02:15.125
Where are you going? Come here.

02:15.708 --> 02:16.541
Here.

02:18.125 --> 02:19.875
Your dad has his head in the clouds.

02:19.958 --> 02:22.958
If you don't take care of business,
we'll close up shop.

02:23.041 --> 02:25.291
-Got it?
-But I work all night!

02:25.375 --> 02:26.375
Can't I sleep?

02:26.458 --> 02:29.291
-But why on the Tiber? It's filthy.
-And you smell great?

02:29.375 --> 02:31.583
Don't talk to your grandma like that!

02:31.666 --> 02:33.708
I do better business than you do here.

02:33.791 --> 02:34.791
Oh yeah?

02:36.166 --> 02:38.041
You call this business?

02:38.125 --> 02:40.416
Carnies don't steal. We're decent people.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.250
-I'm sorry.
-That's right.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.958
We need to set up the haunted house.

02:52.250 --> 02:53.166
You know what?

02:54.208 --> 02:56.041
Tonight you can read my tarots.

02:56.583 --> 02:57.458
Really?

02:58.416 --> 03:00.833
God, Granny, are you getting old or what?

03:00.916 --> 03:03.666
When you were little,
you used to pester me and your mom

03:03.750 --> 03:05.500
to read them and now you insult me?

03:05.583 --> 03:08.458
I'm kidding. It means a lot.
Thanks, Grandma!

03:09.333 --> 03:10.458
It's not a game.

03:14.791 --> 03:16.583
Don't mess around with people.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.750
Not so much for the people,

03:20.833 --> 03:22.166
but for the tarots.

03:23.833 --> 03:25.333
You have to respect them

03:25.833 --> 03:27.541
or they'll get their revenge.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.125
Promise me.

03:30.875 --> 03:31.958
I promise.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.333
Yeah, right!
You're such a silly little girl!

03:39.625 --> 03:42.791
-Here it is! Were you looking for this?
-Good job! You found it.

03:48.833 --> 03:49.666
Dad!

03:51.000 --> 03:53.791
-Grandma will let me read the tarots.
-It's about time.

03:53.875 --> 03:54.708
Yes.

03:56.291 --> 03:59.125
-Okay, this isn't finished yet.
-What is it?

04:00.791 --> 04:01.666
Cool.

04:09.166 --> 04:10.750
Try it. Here.

04:12.750 --> 04:15.333
Here you go. So rest this here.

04:16.291 --> 04:17.208
Aim here.

04:18.583 --> 04:19.750
There, at the ring.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.750
There. You see?

04:30.375 --> 04:31.375
It's called Polaroid.

04:32.791 --> 04:34.583
It's a magic camera.

04:34.666 --> 04:37.416
-I think they ripped you off though.
-Wait.

04:37.500 --> 04:40.375
Grandma says the skeletons
were a rip-off too.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.250
She's just a pain in the ass.

04:42.333 --> 04:45.416
Anyway, she has fun with that,
I have fun with this.

04:45.500 --> 04:48.583
Since we have a full house every night,
it means we're well-matched.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.000
There you go. Look.

05:00.916 --> 05:02.500
You look just like your mother.

05:03.416 --> 05:04.791
The same sly smile.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.333
What if Grandma was right?

05:10.583 --> 05:13.291
If Mom is watching over us,
she'd be happy about the tarots.

05:13.375 --> 05:14.583
Of course she would.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.666
You're the queen of the carnival now.

05:43.375 --> 05:45.833
Ready. Get ready.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.750
Oh, a free seat! Excuse me, miss.

05:48.833 --> 05:51.166
Don't worry. He's always like that.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.291
-Can I sit on the outside?
-Yes.

05:56.625 --> 05:58.375
Thanks for waiting, huh?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.583
-Giggi is in a hurry.
-C'est la vie.

06:03.458 --> 06:04.916
We don't have to do this.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.916
No! This is a test of courage.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.458
Tests of courage are stupid.

06:08.541 --> 06:11.125
The Spartans used to send
their children into the woods.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.916
Let's go, Spartacus!

06:16.458 --> 06:17.666
Up we go!

06:23.583 --> 06:26.291
-Oh God, I'm sorry. Does it bother you?
-No.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.250
I may sweat a little.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.083
It is a little damp.

06:33.833 --> 06:35.458
-See?
-No, it's okay.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.833
They go pretty high, huh?

06:50.458 --> 06:52.916
-I'm not afraid at all.
-Yes, you are!

06:53.000 --> 06:54.208
Not at all!

07:00.083 --> 07:02.333
If this is the last time
we see each other--

07:02.416 --> 07:03.250
What?

07:12.375 --> 07:13.375
Another one!

07:22.000 --> 07:23.083
-Yes!
-Nice!

07:33.083 --> 07:35.708
-Hurry up!
-You're super strong!

07:36.291 --> 07:37.625
-Bravo!
-Primo Carnera.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.541
See? You'll never get that score.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.666
Come on. Are you stupid or what?

07:48.125 --> 07:52.041
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

07:52.666 --> 07:54.416
Can you play tennis?

07:54.500 --> 07:56.666
Again? Enough! Leave them alone.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.000
They were reconsidering.

07:58.083 --> 08:00.333
-Forgive him.
-No, they weren't.

08:00.416 --> 08:02.250
Look! Take me to the bumper cars!

08:02.333 --> 08:04.125
-But you can't drive.
-I'm a driver.

08:04.208 --> 08:05.583
-Yeah, right!
-I'm a pro.

08:05.666 --> 08:07.291
It's beautiful, isn't it?

08:09.875 --> 08:11.000
What's he doing?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.458
Did you take the photo?

08:30.500 --> 08:32.916
One second. Wait!

08:33.000 --> 08:35.625
Hey, beautiful. Want to know your future?

08:36.125 --> 08:37.833
It's the oldest scam in the world.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.416
Maybe it is, or maybe not.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.833
You could discover things
you don't know about.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.250
-Really?
-Really.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.500
Well, I'm not scared.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.000
-I'll give you a discount.
-Yes.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.000
Come on.

08:51.916 --> 08:53.208
And there goes Rosa.

08:53.291 --> 08:54.541
Bumper cars!

08:57.375 --> 08:59.916
-What is it? Let's go.
-What? Yeah.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.625
So?

09:07.708 --> 09:08.958
What do you want to know?

09:09.041 --> 09:10.125
Yeah…

09:10.208 --> 09:13.125
So I'd like to know…

09:15.458 --> 09:18.041
if I'll ever finish
writing my first novel.

09:18.958 --> 09:20.333
First, 500 lire.

09:20.916 --> 09:21.750
Yes.

09:28.625 --> 09:30.333
What is this novel about?

09:30.416 --> 09:31.916
It's fiction.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.166
It's about this young seamstress

09:34.250 --> 09:36.833
who wakes up one day and,
instead of going to work,

09:36.916 --> 09:40.958
she decides to move to Paris
with her cat to design clothes.

09:41.041 --> 09:43.708
-But then--
-Don't tell me the whole story.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.000
I may want to read it.

09:45.083 --> 09:47.041
Oh really? You can read?

09:57.791 --> 09:59.458
See? The Old Woman.

09:59.541 --> 10:03.208
This means you have to grow,
you have to seriously commit to writing.

10:03.291 --> 10:05.541
But I write and read all the time.

10:05.625 --> 10:07.791
It's not enough. Come out of your shell.

10:07.875 --> 10:10.666
Otherwise,
you'll always be the girl who reads…

10:10.750 --> 10:11.708
What do you read?

10:11.791 --> 10:14.125
Comic strips with your bedroom light on?

10:17.000 --> 10:19.583
Listen, can I ask you another question?

10:19.666 --> 10:21.333
I'll save you the money on this one.

10:21.416 --> 10:22.750
-He's smitten.
-Who?

10:23.333 --> 10:25.625
The goofy guy. The one with the scarf.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.708
No…

10:30.500 --> 10:32.291
Actually, it's something else.

10:33.041 --> 10:33.875
What?

10:51.083 --> 10:52.583
Will I ever find my sister?

10:53.458 --> 10:54.708
What happened to her?

10:55.208 --> 10:57.041
-Did she leave?
-She went missing.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.916
When we were one and a half.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.333
We're twins, you know.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.166
We're different, but we're twins.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.416
Was she kidnapped?

11:08.500 --> 11:10.083
Maybe. Who knows?

11:10.916 --> 11:12.666
The police looked all over for her.

11:13.250 --> 11:16.291
My father even hired
a private investigator.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.416
He's still paying him, 20 years later.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.166
It's just that,

11:21.916 --> 11:23.250
sometimes,

11:24.791 --> 11:26.166
I think I've found her.

11:27.416 --> 11:30.666
If I walk down the street
and see a girl that looks familiar,

11:30.750 --> 11:31.625
I follow her.

11:31.708 --> 11:35.875
I'm not crazy. It's just that
I can feel she's still alive.

11:35.958 --> 11:38.750
Also, Adele wouldn't even
be hard to recognize,

11:38.833 --> 11:40.875
she has a butterfly here, on her back.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.083
A what?

11:44.583 --> 11:47.958
It's a pink birthmark
shaped like a butterfly. Here.

11:50.750 --> 11:51.750
What is it?

11:53.666 --> 11:54.750
Nothing.

12:07.208 --> 12:09.291
Your sister should still be alive.

12:19.333 --> 12:22.250
And the tarots say
that she's very close to you now.

12:23.916 --> 12:26.166
They say she's close to me? How close?

12:26.250 --> 12:28.083
What does that mean? Where--

12:29.791 --> 12:31.083
Let's see.

12:48.875 --> 12:49.708
What is it?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.208
What are you doing?

12:54.291 --> 12:56.458
I'm sorry, I can't go any further.

12:56.541 --> 13:00.000
What do you mean?
You told me that my sister is very close--

13:00.083 --> 13:02.500
My mother was good at this,
so was my grandma.

13:02.583 --> 13:04.458
-I only get it sometimes.
-Well, finish--

13:04.541 --> 13:05.833
You have to leave!

13:10.875 --> 13:11.791
Okay.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.375
So? Will you be a famous writer?

13:22.458 --> 13:25.666
I asked her about Adele.
And the tarots say that she's close to me.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.208
Could be the girl
from the restaurant by your house.

13:28.291 --> 13:29.958
Do you remember the vibe I felt?

13:30.041 --> 13:32.083
Here we go again. She's obsessed.

13:32.166 --> 13:34.291
Giggi, how can you be so insensitive?

13:34.375 --> 13:36.000
We're talking about our sister.

13:36.083 --> 13:38.333
What if it really is
the girl from the restaurant?

13:38.416 --> 13:39.916
And what if I'm Elvis Presley?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.333
Please. I spent all my money.
Can I borrow some from you?

13:43.416 --> 13:46.458
-I'm craving cotton candy.
-You're all monsters.

13:46.541 --> 13:47.750
That is very true.

13:48.666 --> 13:50.791
Oh God. I've lost my wallet.

13:50.875 --> 13:52.833
Ouch. The fortune teller strikes again!

13:52.916 --> 13:54.541
How do you know it was her?

13:54.625 --> 13:57.416
Of course it was.
You could tell she was a thief!

13:58.041 --> 13:59.458
Fine. I'll take care of it.

14:06.416 --> 14:08.416
-What happened to knocking?
-On a tent?

14:08.500 --> 14:10.000
We're closed.

14:11.083 --> 14:12.750
Give me back the wallet.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.416
What wallet?

14:15.500 --> 14:17.458
My friend's, hand it over.

14:18.333 --> 14:21.083
I'm not a thief. I'm a fortune teller.

14:23.958 --> 14:25.208
What's that on your back?

14:25.291 --> 14:27.083
It's a tattoo? Why?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.250
Nothing. I've never seen one before.

14:29.333 --> 14:31.000
It's a rare thing, in fact.

14:31.708 --> 14:33.333
Mildred Wallace did it for me.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.708
She's a great circus artist
in Coney Island.

14:37.791 --> 14:39.958
-You've been to America?
-Yes.

14:40.625 --> 14:41.916
I've been everywhere.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.208
When I was little,
my parents had a traveling show.

14:45.291 --> 14:48.791
-What a wonderful life you must lead.
-Yes, in some ways.

14:49.291 --> 14:51.750
But try washing yourself
in a fountain in January.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.166
Your ears freeze.

14:54.500 --> 14:56.750
Maybe it's better to live a simpler life.

14:56.833 --> 14:57.666
Really?

14:58.166 --> 15:00.583
Stuck in this city,
always doing the same things?

15:00.666 --> 15:03.583
No. I'd rather freeze my ears off
for the rest of my life.

15:05.250 --> 15:06.250
What's this?

15:06.333 --> 15:07.541
I'm a photojournalist.

15:08.791 --> 15:11.541
You're rich. Why don't you travel?

15:12.291 --> 15:15.250
My parents want me to make it on my own.
They're communists.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.333
That's nice.

15:17.416 --> 15:20.250
I don't think
anyone has ever called them that.

15:25.125 --> 15:26.166
Will you help me?

15:28.708 --> 15:30.250
-Yes.
-Thanks.

15:42.291 --> 15:43.666
It's a nice tattoo.

15:44.250 --> 15:45.208
Anyway…

15:46.208 --> 15:49.750
Being a free spirit with Mommy
and Daddy's money isn't cool.

15:49.833 --> 15:52.958
Sure. It's better to do it
with someone else's wallet.

15:53.500 --> 15:56.125
Listen, pal.
I work here 15 hours a day. And you?

15:56.791 --> 15:58.250
I sell photos to the newspapers.

15:58.333 --> 16:00.500
When they're willing to buy them, that is.

16:03.541 --> 16:04.625
What's going on?

16:04.708 --> 16:06.208
The sorceress stole you too?

16:06.291 --> 16:08.250
Nobody stole me. Don't worry.

16:08.333 --> 16:10.916
-Well, shall we go?
-Let's go.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.875
My respects, madam clairvoyant.

16:14.375 --> 16:17.041
-Who's that moron?
-Giggi, my best friend.

16:17.125 --> 16:18.416
Of course.

16:18.500 --> 16:19.666
Now, go.

16:26.875 --> 16:28.083
You're still here?

16:28.166 --> 16:29.208
Go!

16:29.291 --> 16:31.875
-Let me know if you find the wallet.
-Sure.

16:39.083 --> 16:39.958
Yes?

16:41.083 --> 16:42.583
That's great news!

16:42.666 --> 16:44.250
That was fast.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.458
Good, great. So you'll keep me informed?

16:48.416 --> 16:49.791
Great job, Fausto.

16:52.458 --> 16:55.625
Thanks. We'll talk soon. Thank you.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.208
So it's all set.

16:58.291 --> 17:01.166
Minnella spoke with a friend of his,
a movie star agent.

17:01.666 --> 17:03.500
-You got the audition.
-Really, Dad?

17:03.583 --> 17:04.583
Why would I lie?

17:05.458 --> 17:07.083
-I got the audition!
-Yes.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.166
Tullio,
you shouldn't pull strings for him.

17:09.250 --> 17:11.500
I didn't. It's just a little nudge.

17:11.583 --> 17:14.125
He's too lazy.
He needs a kick in the butt!

17:14.208 --> 17:16.250
You said it, Dad! Right, Esther?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.791
You could study like your sister.

17:18.875 --> 17:21.541
I've heard of certain places
called "schools."

17:21.625 --> 17:23.875
Study? He wants to be an actor,
not a surgeon.

17:24.708 --> 17:27.083
Besides, Minnella owes me.
He's happy to help.

17:27.166 --> 17:28.791
Why not try to make it on your own?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.000
-Like your friend, Simone.
-Yeah, right.

17:31.083 --> 17:33.583
His parents never give him
or Matteo anything for free.

17:33.666 --> 17:36.875
Let's not talk about communists
at the table or I'll choke on my food.

17:36.958 --> 17:38.208
Never mind, sorry.

17:39.791 --> 17:41.791
The menu for tomorrow's dinner is ready.

17:42.916 --> 17:45.041
-God, the dinner. What a nightmare!
-Nightmare?

17:45.125 --> 17:46.916
Dad, please. Do we have to go?

17:47.000 --> 17:48.500
-What do you mean?
-What?

17:49.333 --> 17:51.583
You don't want to come
to your father's party?

17:51.666 --> 17:54.250
Mom, last year was tragic.
You all got drunk.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.791
That's not true. Come on.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.583
"Not true"? You fell off the boat!

17:58.375 --> 18:00.458
No, honey. Mommy doesn't drink.

18:00.541 --> 18:01.916
Mommy sips at the most,

18:02.000 --> 18:04.250
every now and then on social occasions.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.833
Mommy sipped quite a bit
on that social occasion.

18:06.916 --> 18:10.041
If you'd rather not come
to your father's birthday party, don't.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.583
-I'm getting old.
-No!

18:11.666 --> 18:14.041
-Up to you.
-No, Dad, we're coming. Okay.

18:14.125 --> 18:17.166
How come kids these days
don't know how to have fun, huh, honey?

18:17.250 --> 18:18.833
You don't appreciate being happy.

18:19.416 --> 18:20.958
-And you know why?
-Why?

18:21.041 --> 18:23.958
Because you haven't fought.
You haven't been through war.

18:24.041 --> 18:26.958
Unlike our valiant general here, right?

18:27.041 --> 18:30.375
I would have gladly fought in the war,
but I had a heart murmur.

18:30.458 --> 18:33.958
A murmur? Come on, Dad.
Nobody believes that story anymore.

18:34.041 --> 18:36.541
-Sweetie, Dad really had a heart murmur.
-Yes.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.375
-I'm going to study.
-What a good girl.

18:39.458 --> 18:42.166
Don't be an idiot,
or I'll call Minnella back.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.541
-No!
-Stop it.

18:58.541 --> 19:00.000
Listen to me, please!

19:00.083 --> 19:03.291
You know the part.
We've gone over it a hundred times!

19:04.041 --> 19:05.875
-Some friend you are!
-Really?

19:05.958 --> 19:07.500
-Seriously, thank you!
-Whatever.

19:07.583 --> 19:08.583
Are you scared?

19:10.166 --> 19:11.000
I am.

19:11.791 --> 19:12.625
No.

19:13.125 --> 19:15.541
No, this is not my first audition,
you know?

19:15.625 --> 19:17.875
No. It's not his first audition.
It's his last!

19:18.375 --> 19:21.333
-I've only been in Rome for two days.
-Two days? Unbelievable.

19:21.416 --> 19:22.833
Where are you from, miss?

19:22.916 --> 19:25.666
-Sardinia.
-Really? I would have never guessed!

19:25.750 --> 19:27.708
I want to take elocution lessons.

19:27.791 --> 19:30.541
No, you know what you need? Friends.

19:30.625 --> 19:32.916
And I, for one,
have the right connections.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.791
His dad
has the right connections, not him.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.208
-Shut up.
-Are you an actor too?

19:38.291 --> 19:39.666
No. I'm a photojournalist.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.583
-And I'm Adriano Celentano. See my swing?
-Yeah, sure.

19:54.291 --> 19:55.416
Stop.

20:10.250 --> 20:13.083
Is that Sandro Ralli? Simone?

20:14.125 --> 20:15.916
-Is that really him?
-It is.

20:21.250 --> 20:22.541
Here's my number.

20:27.708 --> 20:29.958
-What happened?
-Oh my God, guys.

20:31.708 --> 20:35.333
I can't believe it! He asked me
to dinner. Friday at the Mocambo.

20:35.416 --> 20:37.625
Sandro Ralli asked me out to dinner!

20:37.708 --> 20:39.625
-He invited her to dinner.
-I feel…

20:39.708 --> 20:42.500
-Can you hold me up?
-Yes, of course. Just breathe.

20:52.750 --> 20:55.458
-There. Marie Antoinette is ready too.
-Good job, Tina.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.125
-You think the wig will hold, Antonio?
-It will.

21:12.083 --> 21:14.083
-Hi.
-Hi, Antonio.

21:15.833 --> 21:18.750
I am the ghost of the countess!

21:18.833 --> 21:22.541
What countess? It's Beatrice Cenci,
Rome's most famous ghost.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.541
Please forgive our ignorance!

21:24.625 --> 21:28.291
I mean, this is a tribute
to the most famous ghosts in the world.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.791
Look how well Marilyn turned out!

21:35.875 --> 21:37.708
Poor girl. She just died.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.208
Oh, come on.

21:40.208 --> 21:43.000
-You're a true artist, Dad.
-We're closed.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.875
Is he deaf? We're closed.

21:47.625 --> 21:48.541
No…

21:50.250 --> 21:51.541
I can't believe it!

21:55.000 --> 21:55.958
Ettore.

22:00.958 --> 22:01.791
Well?

22:02.291 --> 22:03.250
How do I look?

22:05.375 --> 22:07.083
-Good.
-Yeah?

22:07.166 --> 22:09.083
All right? The mustache?

22:09.166 --> 22:10.291
-It's good.
-Too much?

22:10.375 --> 22:11.583
-No.
-A bit frivolous?

22:14.041 --> 22:14.916
So,

22:16.333 --> 22:18.583
let's start by handing out the goods.

22:19.625 --> 22:20.500
Madam.

22:26.250 --> 22:28.958
Ettore, so luxurious.

22:31.916 --> 22:34.458
Yes, put a little more on,
I can't smell it.

22:34.541 --> 22:35.375
Well…

22:35.458 --> 22:38.333
Don't listen to her.
In Paris, they put on a bottle per day.

22:38.416 --> 22:39.250
See?

22:39.333 --> 22:42.541
Where have you been all this time?
I was worried. You never called.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.750
I wanted to surprise
my big brother. Can't I?

22:45.375 --> 22:47.500
In fact, I wanted to surprise you twice.

22:55.833 --> 22:57.958
-No.
-No way!

22:59.083 --> 23:00.375
"The Flight."

23:01.416 --> 23:02.291
But…

23:02.375 --> 23:05.083
I remember it. It was the first ride
you and Mom designed.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.666
I thought it was lost forever.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.875
It was behind the sink in the old trailer.

23:08.958 --> 23:11.333
I won't tell you how I found it, because…

23:11.416 --> 23:12.666
This is wonderful!

23:14.166 --> 23:17.500
And I should have something for you too.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.625
Or maybe not.

23:20.416 --> 23:21.375
No peeping.

23:22.833 --> 23:23.875
No peeping.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.666
Close your eyes.

23:32.000 --> 23:33.000
And voilà.

23:33.583 --> 23:34.583
Time travel.

23:38.708 --> 23:39.833
What is this?

23:40.416 --> 23:42.791
In there, you and your mom
are still together.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.083
Can we watch it?

24:34.333 --> 24:36.041
My daughter was so beautiful!

24:37.958 --> 24:39.666
She looked like a movie star.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.541
Where was that?

24:47.625 --> 24:49.208
In America. Yes.

24:49.291 --> 24:52.750
I remember. She was little
and always chasing cows. Remember?

24:54.125 --> 24:54.958
Yes.

25:21.625 --> 25:23.625
Look! I cooked for you!

25:23.708 --> 25:27.166
Rigatoni carbonara.
If this isn't love, I don't know what is.

25:28.750 --> 25:30.125
Who let this guy loose?

25:30.208 --> 25:33.000
He's a friend of Minnella.
You're the one who recommended him.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.000
I don't think so.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.750
I'd like to try a more dramatic tone now.

25:36.833 --> 25:39.416
Look! I cooked for you!

25:39.500 --> 25:41.583
Rigatoni carbonara!

25:41.666 --> 25:45.291
If this isn't-- if this--
If this isn't love, I don't know what is.

25:45.375 --> 25:48.375
Listen, try to be a little more natural.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.250
-I could make it my own.
-How? It's just a simple line.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.541
-I could improvise the sauce?
-Christ.

25:55.375 --> 25:58.500
Amatriciana? Cacio e pepe?
Oxtail sauce? You know what?

25:58.583 --> 26:01.916
I'm a very physical actor and I need
to move my hands around a bit.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.458
Use them to hold the plate.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.916
I already am. You're not paying attention!

26:06.000 --> 26:09.541
Maybe I could use it as a headdress.
I'm also a talented dancer.

26:10.541 --> 26:11.625
He's funny.

26:12.500 --> 26:14.000
Quite the joker.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.166
You know what he may be good for?

26:16.250 --> 26:17.791
Yes. For nothing.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.958
Okay. I think that's enough.

26:20.041 --> 26:21.958
-We'll let you know.
-You'll let me know?

26:24.041 --> 26:25.041
Yeah, I bet.

26:25.833 --> 26:26.875
Wait.

26:27.541 --> 26:29.750
Maybe it's the heat going to my head,

26:29.833 --> 26:32.250
but I must admit,
you have some kind of raw talent.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.000
Would you be interested in doing TV?

26:37.083 --> 26:38.333
Are you kidding?

26:40.250 --> 26:42.583
Italian television, get ready!

26:42.666 --> 26:44.333
Giggi Gabrielli is coming!

26:55.791 --> 26:56.750
No!

26:57.916 --> 26:59.791
Enough. Let me catch my breath.

26:59.875 --> 27:03.166
-You don't want to play anymore?
-No. I want a lemonade.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.000
Just like that?

27:10.083 --> 27:11.916
Yes. It's a big house.

27:12.000 --> 27:13.791
But since we're working out,

27:13.875 --> 27:16.958
we could walk to the kitchen
without disturbing the help.

27:17.041 --> 27:20.625
You don't know Esther. If she sees me
in the kitchen, she'll go nuts.

27:20.708 --> 27:22.125
Plus, I'm thirsty.

27:24.333 --> 27:27.500
"You are my thirst
and what must quench it."

27:28.375 --> 27:29.291
It's beautiful.

27:29.375 --> 27:31.833
Yes, but it's not mine. It's Neruda.

27:32.416 --> 27:34.250
-Love poems.
-Can I borrow them?

27:35.041 --> 27:36.666
They may be a little too strong.

27:36.750 --> 27:39.833
So? Matteo, don't be so protective, okay?

27:39.916 --> 27:43.333
She's right. If it were up to you,
I'd only read comic strips.

27:43.416 --> 27:45.708
-Who's right?
-The girl from the carnival.

27:46.625 --> 27:47.750
-She said that?
-Yes.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.000
And also that Adele is very close to me.

27:50.083 --> 27:52.250
Which is why I made a list
of all the girls

27:52.333 --> 27:53.583
who might be her.

27:53.666 --> 27:57.458
Because the fortune teller said so?
Come on, Rosa. You're better than that.

27:57.541 --> 27:59.833
Why? I have nothing against magic.

28:01.208 --> 28:02.708
You never give up, huh?

28:04.333 --> 28:05.291
And you like that?

28:05.375 --> 28:06.291
Unfortunately.

28:12.125 --> 28:14.666
You won't believe
what happened to us in Cinecittà!

28:14.750 --> 28:15.875
It was crazy!

28:15.958 --> 28:17.458
Sandro Ralli is short.

28:17.541 --> 28:19.000
Like you're a giant!

28:19.083 --> 28:21.041
I'll be auditioning for TV, while you--

28:21.125 --> 28:22.833
Giggi, I'm so proud of you!

28:22.916 --> 28:26.500
Do you know how much my paper would pay
for a photo of Ralli with that girl?

28:26.583 --> 28:27.666
How much?

28:27.750 --> 28:29.750
Up to 30,000 lire
if you catch them kissing.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.875
His paper. He's been there two months
and thinks he owns it.

28:32.958 --> 28:35.166
-Yes, but he's already very good.
-So good!

28:35.250 --> 28:38.416
For 30,000 lire,
I will sleep outside the Mocambo!

28:39.041 --> 28:41.458
-I'm going.
-Doesn't sound like your kind of scoop.

28:41.541 --> 28:42.541
Oh, but it is.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.750
In fact, you can call me "paparazzo."

28:46.500 --> 28:47.791
Paparazzo.

29:07.500 --> 29:09.541
Why did we come here?

29:09.625 --> 29:10.666
-What?
-Why?

29:10.750 --> 29:12.666
I've been away from Rome for 20 years!

29:12.750 --> 29:15.791
Oh, please! This isn't Rome.

29:16.416 --> 29:17.875
-What is it, then?
-It's fake.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.875
-It's not, it's electric.
-And it will short circuit.

29:20.958 --> 29:23.791
Go have a look around Mandrione.
Just a bunch of shacks.

29:23.875 --> 29:27.125
People from the countryside aren't allowed
to sleep in the city center.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.916
It takes time.

29:29.416 --> 29:32.083
Money brings more money.
Listen to your brother.

29:32.166 --> 29:33.583
I must confess something.

29:34.833 --> 29:35.666
Nora.

29:37.791 --> 29:39.125
I didn't recognize her.

29:39.208 --> 29:41.000
-She's great, huh?
-She's grown.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.083
I'm so happy she grew up in the carnival.

29:46.416 --> 29:47.625
Why are you laughing?

29:49.208 --> 29:50.666
You've become sedentary.

29:50.750 --> 29:53.125
At least Nora has a place
she can call home.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.541
A trailer is not a home, old sport.
It's just a trailer.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.958
-Do you realize what you have done?
-Of course.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.791
Do you realize that you're sitting
on a pot of gold?

30:07.416 --> 30:10.291
Yes. I'm just happy
that we've become a community.

30:10.375 --> 30:11.583
-A community?
-It's enough.

30:11.666 --> 30:13.583
-It's enough for you?
-It is, yes.

30:13.666 --> 30:16.333
Ettore, you need to put your roots down.
Stay in Rome.

30:16.416 --> 30:18.291
-You're not so young anymore.
-Fuck you.

30:18.375 --> 30:21.041
-The years are passing for you too.
-Still younger than you.

30:21.125 --> 30:22.500
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

30:25.666 --> 30:27.791
Step right up!

30:31.583 --> 30:33.416
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:33.500 --> 30:35.791
come inside the haunted house

30:35.875 --> 30:37.875
and you will lose your head,

30:38.708 --> 30:39.625
just like me.

30:40.125 --> 30:42.000
I am the executioner of Rome!

30:42.083 --> 30:45.583
Run away while you can
before Mastro Titta catches you!

30:46.458 --> 30:47.625
Run away!

30:48.333 --> 30:49.541
Run away!

30:55.208 --> 30:57.583
It was nice watching Mom's videos.

30:57.666 --> 30:58.666
Yes, it was.

31:01.375 --> 31:03.291
What was that thing on my back?

31:03.375 --> 31:04.583
Nothing. What thing?

31:06.291 --> 31:07.666
It looked like a birthmark.

31:07.750 --> 31:09.041
Really? Maybe.

31:10.833 --> 31:12.166
I didn't remember having one.

31:12.250 --> 31:15.208
Because your mom got you the tattoo
when you were little.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.583
Why?

31:17.125 --> 31:17.958
Why, what?

31:18.041 --> 31:19.000
I mean,

31:20.583 --> 31:23.708
she didn't have any tattoos,
neither does Dad. Why me?

31:25.416 --> 31:27.375
They must've had the opportunity to do it.

31:29.083 --> 31:30.291
Listen, Grandma.

31:30.833 --> 31:32.666
Since you always keep everything,

31:32.750 --> 31:35.500
do have a photo of my mom
when she was pregnant with me?

31:36.916 --> 31:39.041
I'd have to dig through the mess.

31:40.125 --> 31:42.291
Then dig. It would be nice.

31:44.666 --> 31:45.541
Back to work.

31:48.333 --> 31:50.625
Gather around!

31:59.000 --> 32:00.083
Excuse me.

32:02.083 --> 32:03.083
Hold this.

32:07.916 --> 32:10.750
-What happened?
-Nothing. I'm just in a bad mood.

32:11.416 --> 32:13.416
After all, they cut my head off.

32:13.500 --> 32:16.416
Don't bullshit me!
I've known you since we were kids.

32:16.500 --> 32:17.416
What happened?

32:18.708 --> 32:21.291
-Do you want to know the truth?
-Yes.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.500
The truth is I'm not who I thought I was.

32:26.583 --> 32:29.333
I'm someone else.
Someone I don't even know.

32:29.416 --> 32:31.500
You've always been who you are.

32:35.166 --> 32:37.416
You don't want to talk about it. I get it.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.375
-Should I grab two beers?
-Good idea.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.333
Hey. Thank you, Celeste.

32:59.708 --> 33:01.875
Professor, can I take this one?

33:03.416 --> 33:05.166
Enough with this "professor," okay?

33:05.250 --> 33:07.000
You've already passed my courses.

33:09.041 --> 33:09.916
Henry Miller.

33:10.500 --> 33:13.083
I must warn you.
It's a bit of a bold read.

33:14.541 --> 33:17.500
Essential though.
A must-read for a modern girl.

33:17.583 --> 33:20.625
But if your father finds out,
I had nothing to do with it.

33:20.708 --> 33:21.916
Deal.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.416
I'll go back to studying, then. Thank you.

33:25.500 --> 33:27.791
Enough.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.291
Even the greatest scholars take a break.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.291
-Thank you so much, Doriana.
-Milk?

33:32.375 --> 33:33.541
-Yes.
-Good.

33:35.166 --> 33:36.041
Here you go.

33:39.458 --> 33:40.291
Thank you.

33:40.375 --> 33:45.458
I've heard that you and Dad
are bidding for the same piece of land.

33:46.625 --> 33:47.583
I'm sorry.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.291
No, honey. Nothing to do with you.

33:50.375 --> 33:53.625
The truth is,
I would like you to win the bid.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.791
So many people come from the countryside.

33:56.875 --> 33:59.875
A place for them to stay
sounds like a great idea.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.625
She is an angel, isn't she?

34:12.291 --> 34:13.125
Who?

34:14.500 --> 34:15.958
What do you mean, who? Rosa.

34:18.125 --> 34:20.125
That's it. I've decided.
I'll do it tonight.

34:20.208 --> 34:21.625
Will you give me a hand?

34:22.166 --> 34:23.958
Don't you think it's a little reckless?

34:24.041 --> 34:26.875
You've only had that ring
in your pocket for, what? Two months?

34:26.958 --> 34:29.208
Well, it was never the right time. I--

34:29.291 --> 34:30.750
Sure, the "right time."

34:30.833 --> 34:32.125
What?

34:32.208 --> 34:34.291
Nothing. I'm just saying,

34:34.375 --> 34:35.791
you haven't even kissed yet.

34:35.875 --> 34:39.208
No, I was going to,
but then you two got in the way.

34:39.916 --> 34:41.916
So? Aren't you going to try again?

34:42.916 --> 34:46.250
I don't know,
I feel a little stuck right now.

34:48.291 --> 34:49.708
What's the problem?

34:52.166 --> 34:53.708
She's the love of my life.

34:54.291 --> 34:55.958
I want to do things properly.

34:59.208 --> 35:01.583
-Here you are.
-Mom, get out!

35:01.666 --> 35:03.916
-I'm developing my photos.
-You'll take Rosa home?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.541
-We will.
-Don't worry.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.041
-I like that one!
-Yes, it's beautiful. Go!

35:09.458 --> 35:10.583
And the curtain goes up!

35:11.291 --> 35:12.375
-No.
-Here it is.

35:22.875 --> 35:24.500
Is it just how you remember it?

35:25.000 --> 35:28.708
THE AMAZING MARINI BROTHERS

35:34.250 --> 35:35.625
"The Amazing Brothers."

35:37.791 --> 35:39.125
This can be your home.

35:40.458 --> 35:42.083
You just need to fix it up.

35:45.125 --> 35:45.958
I don't know.

35:46.041 --> 35:47.541
-There he is.
-Our little cousin.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.541
-We'll talk about it later.
-So?

35:49.625 --> 35:51.791
Hey, guys! How's it going?

35:52.291 --> 35:53.875
All good? Do you remember them?

35:53.958 --> 35:56.500
I met them the other night,
after we parted.

35:56.583 --> 35:57.875
We played a little poker.

35:58.916 --> 35:59.916
They're stuntmen.

36:00.000 --> 36:02.875
-Really?
-What are these two assholes doing here?

36:02.958 --> 36:05.125
-We stopped by to say hi.
-Hi, Miranda.

36:05.208 --> 36:06.208
Hi.

36:09.291 --> 36:10.916
Let's go for a walk. Come on.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.000
Yes. You better go.

36:14.000 --> 36:15.083
Let's go.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.083
You take care, Celeste.

36:21.166 --> 36:24.041
Listen, we wanted to talk to you,
away from Antonio.

36:24.125 --> 36:26.583
What have you done to my brother?
Why is he so pissed?

36:26.666 --> 36:29.125
He thought we were into
some shady business.

36:29.708 --> 36:31.041
I mean, maybe we were.

36:31.125 --> 36:33.375
A little bit.
But we're all cleaned up now.

36:33.458 --> 36:36.375
Yes. We've even learned sword fighting.

36:36.458 --> 36:37.500
You don't say?

36:38.125 --> 36:40.041
-Why don't you join us?
-Where?

36:40.125 --> 36:41.250
In Cinecittà.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.416
They pay acrobats twice as much there.

36:47.250 --> 36:49.208
-Why not?
-Why not?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.708
It's young people stuff.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.708
What are you gonna do, then?

36:54.666 --> 36:55.833
Are you staying or not?

36:55.916 --> 36:57.708
I've just arrived. I'll think about it.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.416
Okay. Let us know, cousin.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.541
We've got some interesting ideas.

37:01.625 --> 37:04.250
Profitable stuff, real profitable.

37:35.208 --> 37:37.791
THE MARVELOUS MIRANDA

38:40.250 --> 38:41.500
Look, sweetheart.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.583
These are Mommy's magic cards.

38:43.666 --> 38:46.333
They tell you about your future,
your dreams,

38:46.416 --> 38:48.083
and your hopes. Okay?

38:48.958 --> 38:51.000
This one here, what card is this?

38:51.083 --> 38:53.208
-The Queen.
-Good!

38:53.291 --> 38:54.625
It's the Empress.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.541
What about this one?

38:57.291 --> 39:00.250
-A bicycle.
-More or less. It's a wheel.

39:00.333 --> 39:02.916
A big, big, big, big wheel.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.708
It represents luck, my love.

39:05.208 --> 39:06.041
And this one?

39:07.500 --> 39:08.333
It broke.

39:08.416 --> 39:10.208
-What a shame!
-No, why?

39:10.291 --> 39:13.000
When a card rips,
it's because it's carrying

39:13.083 --> 39:15.500
a message that's so strong
and revolutionary

39:15.583 --> 39:17.958
that it just can't hold it inside.

39:18.041 --> 39:20.166
-Good or bad?
-It depends.

39:20.250 --> 39:23.125
But I think what this card
is trying to tell us

39:23.666 --> 39:26.166
is that my love for you is so immense,

39:26.250 --> 39:28.833
so big, so huge, so gigantic, that…

39:30.083 --> 39:32.500
-And what is this, Nora?
-It's a sun.

39:32.583 --> 39:34.333
Good! Very good!

39:34.416 --> 39:36.958
You really know them all!

39:37.041 --> 39:38.125
Very good!

39:39.625 --> 39:41.041
You're so smart!

39:53.500 --> 39:57.208
THE GABRIELLIS OFFER REWARD
WORTH MILLIONS:

39:57.291 --> 39:59.791
GIVE US OUR BABY BACK

40:05.625 --> 40:09.708
THE GABRIELLIS EXPAND
THEIR MANOR ON VIA APPIA

40:17.791 --> 40:19.333
Who's in my trailer?

40:21.000 --> 40:24.125
What are you doing in my home,
sneaking in like a mouse?

40:25.333 --> 40:26.583
Who are the Gabriellis?

40:28.083 --> 40:29.791
Have you talked to someone?

40:30.291 --> 40:31.916
Huh, Grandma? Who are they?

40:34.250 --> 40:35.125
Answer me!

40:35.708 --> 40:36.541
No one.

40:37.083 --> 40:40.041
Some people who wanted to buy
a tiger from the circus, I think.

40:40.125 --> 40:41.458
Don't bullshit me!

40:43.958 --> 40:45.000
Listen carefully.

40:47.166 --> 40:50.583
When she got sick,
your mother wasn't afraid of dying.

40:52.458 --> 40:54.166
She was only afraid of one thing.

40:55.708 --> 40:56.875
Leaving you

40:57.500 --> 40:59.208
when you were still a little girl.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.541
Stella was the best mother ever.

41:06.958 --> 41:08.166
Move.

41:16.916 --> 41:18.916
What an exaggeration!

41:19.000 --> 41:20.583
My friends, let me be frank,

41:20.666 --> 41:23.125
you don't know shit about architecture!

41:23.625 --> 41:26.458
Those buildings are my masterpiece!

41:26.541 --> 41:29.666
They're so tall that the neighborhood
doesn't get any wind.

41:29.750 --> 41:31.208
Aren't you happy, councilor?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.041
The wind messes up your hair.

41:33.125 --> 41:35.375
-What do you think, Your Eminence?
-Yes, Tullio.

41:35.458 --> 41:37.000
See, my dear Ersilia?

41:37.083 --> 41:39.208
Even the Holy Church agrees with me.

41:39.708 --> 41:40.625
Thank God.

41:41.291 --> 41:43.250
This one is for you, my love.

41:43.333 --> 41:45.958
For you and all the ladies.

41:46.041 --> 41:47.708
"Ladies" so to speak, right?

41:48.833 --> 41:52.250
I care for you…

41:52.333 --> 41:54.000
What's he doing? Help.

41:54.791 --> 41:57.083
No! Help!

42:02.666 --> 42:04.791
What are you doing, Dad? No!

42:04.875 --> 42:06.500
Your dad is nuts!

42:08.583 --> 42:10.500
Spare us. Please!

42:10.583 --> 42:12.708
No! What are you doing?

42:16.958 --> 42:18.208
Has he gone mad?

42:18.958 --> 42:20.875
God, I can't watch.

42:21.500 --> 42:22.666
Let's go outside.

43:32.833 --> 43:34.458
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

43:38.125 --> 43:40.333
Do you want me to get you
something to drink?

43:42.125 --> 43:43.125
Oh, right.

43:44.166 --> 43:46.583
It's a bit cold. Should we go back inside?

43:56.083 --> 43:57.916
Matteo, I've had enough.

43:58.541 --> 44:01.000
I'm losing my patience.
I can't take it anymore.

44:01.083 --> 44:02.875
I don't know if you like me or not.

44:02.958 --> 44:04.791
-What?
-Actually, I'm sure you don't.

44:04.875 --> 44:06.291
-You find me disgusting.
-How?

44:06.375 --> 44:09.250
If you really liked me,
you would have made a move by now.

44:09.333 --> 44:12.125
A gesture, a word, an attempt…

44:16.083 --> 44:18.375
The problem may be
that I like you too much.

44:20.625 --> 44:21.750
What's that?

44:22.958 --> 44:25.208
I know it's small,
but you should be able to tell.

44:25.291 --> 44:27.416
I know what it is, but what's it for?

44:30.958 --> 44:31.833
Rosa,

44:33.333 --> 44:34.458
will you marry me?

44:35.208 --> 44:36.166
Now?

44:37.083 --> 44:39.833
No, you'll probably prefer
to wait until spring.

44:39.916 --> 44:43.250
Everyone gets married in spring,
but winter is your favorite season.

44:43.333 --> 44:45.125
-So it'd be fine for me.
-No.

44:45.916 --> 44:46.958
-No?
-No.

44:48.500 --> 44:50.000
-No.
-No, I mean…

44:51.416 --> 44:55.500
Sorry, Matteo, but don't you think
that it would make sense

44:55.583 --> 44:58.458
to at least, I don't know,
kiss before we get married?

45:01.000 --> 45:01.875
A kiss.

45:02.833 --> 45:04.125
The kiss.

45:04.208 --> 45:06.416
There's nothing wrong with you, is there?

45:06.916 --> 45:07.750
-No.
-No.

45:07.833 --> 45:09.625
-No, I'm perfectly fine.
-Good.

45:09.708 --> 45:11.583
I just want to do things properly.

45:12.250 --> 45:15.416
Yes, in a Jane Austen novel.
But this is 1962.

45:15.500 --> 45:17.750
-And I'm not made of glass.
-I know.

45:19.041 --> 45:19.875
So?

45:26.166 --> 45:29.666
It's just that I've dreamed
of kissing you so many times

45:30.458 --> 45:31.458
that…

45:33.166 --> 45:35.583
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

45:41.041 --> 45:41.875
All right.

45:42.583 --> 45:43.458
Let's…

45:45.083 --> 45:46.250
disappoint each other.

46:06.291 --> 46:08.041
Finally!

46:08.125 --> 46:09.875
-But…
-Come on!

46:09.958 --> 46:10.916
Good job, Matteo!

46:11.000 --> 46:12.583
-Are you crazy?
-Stop it.

46:12.666 --> 46:14.750
Idiots! You ruined a beautiful moment.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.166
The glasses!

46:18.833 --> 46:21.666
-For you, ma'am.
-Thank you. This is too much!

46:34.500 --> 46:37.750
Let's try and summon the spirits.

46:37.833 --> 46:39.750
We need to form a circle.

46:40.583 --> 46:41.500
There we go.

46:58.250 --> 47:00.666
Why does your wonderful daughter Rosa

47:02.083 --> 47:04.000
go out with that communist asshole?

47:04.083 --> 47:07.083
She's naive.
At that age, you like everyone.

47:09.333 --> 47:10.750
You could take advantage of it.

47:11.541 --> 47:13.875
Our friends wouldn't mind having an eye

47:14.833 --> 47:16.208
on the boy's parents.

47:17.041 --> 47:18.708
You mean Lando and Doriana?

47:19.333 --> 47:21.250
They're just parlor communists.

47:21.333 --> 47:24.041
I don't see them
handing documents to the Soviets.

47:25.166 --> 47:26.333
Keep an eye out.

47:30.083 --> 47:30.916
I'm off.

47:31.666 --> 47:32.666
Are you going back in?

47:33.333 --> 47:34.166
No.

47:36.625 --> 47:38.750
What, are you afraid of ghosts?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.375
I don't believe in ghosts.

47:42.625 --> 47:44.250
But you never know.

47:44.333 --> 47:45.416
What do you mean?

47:46.125 --> 47:47.208
Adele.

47:51.041 --> 47:52.500
Your daughter, Adele?

47:53.125 --> 47:54.458
What would I tell her?

47:56.291 --> 47:58.291
"I'm sorry I couldn't save you"?

48:00.125 --> 48:01.375
It's been 20 years.

48:03.208 --> 48:05.625
You can tell your family
that the child is dead!

48:06.291 --> 48:07.791
Absolutely not.

48:10.625 --> 48:14.208
The only thing that keeps my wife going
is the hope of finding her.

48:15.333 --> 48:16.500
And Rosa too.

48:18.666 --> 48:21.416
Only you and I know that she's dead.

48:22.916 --> 48:24.250
Understand, Minnella?

48:52.958 --> 48:55.041
GABRIELLI MANOR
