WEBVTT

02:09.781 --> 02:12.349
- What's going on?
You're late.
- I'm here.

02:15.700 --> 02:20.444
Don't worry too much.
It's gonna be okay.

02:20.488 --> 02:22.620
Okay... okay...

03:46.617 --> 03:47.662
I'll tell you
what's wrong with this.

03:47.705 --> 03:49.141
It doesn't work.

03:49.185 --> 03:52.014
So I hold down the FN,
I hit the F5...

03:52.057 --> 03:54.016
Computers.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.844
I thought they'd get me rich.

03:55.887 --> 03:59.064
Thought I'd create a killer app and retire before I was 20.

03:59.108 --> 04:01.371
Then get paid 200K a year
giving bullshit talks

04:01.415 --> 04:04.287
about what it takes
to be a success.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.507
Yeah, right.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.160
You know what I learned?

04:08.204 --> 04:11.120
No one truly succeds
without friends on top.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.209
And you know who's on top
of any business?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.385
Fuckin' thieves.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.867
The point is, you don't get
rich by following the rules.

04:18.910 --> 04:20.303
You gotta take what's yours.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.523
...the user mode,'cause I'm a user,

04:22.566 --> 04:26.048
and that's why I thinkit's the graphics card,

04:26.091 --> 04:27.615
and I still havewarranty on it.

04:27.658 --> 04:30.574
So you guys
gotta fix it.

04:32.359 --> 04:34.317
Tsk. I'm just gonna
go to the back

04:34.361 --> 04:35.884
and see if we have
another one.

04:47.156 --> 04:49.680
Your rideis so sick, bro.

04:49.724 --> 04:52.988
It's so... sexy and shit,you know what I mean?

04:54.946 --> 04:56.948
I wish I had that.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.341
No, man.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.521
You shouldn't.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.828
I mean, what is that?

05:06.871 --> 05:09.744
That's nothing.
What are we doing here?

05:09.787 --> 05:12.703
You should be fucking striving
for something more, you know?

05:12.747 --> 05:15.445
Reaching for the fucking stars
and not...

05:15.489 --> 05:18.143
not settling for what I have
or what anybody else has.

05:18.187 --> 05:20.276
It's a simple life.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.973
No.

05:26.978 --> 05:28.240
You don't get it, man.

05:33.942 --> 05:37.337
- It was that one.
-  I see.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.861
- Thank you for your patience
again. Sorry again.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:39.904 --> 05:42.733
Have a great one.
Cheers.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.213
What the heck,Mikey? Where'd you go?

05:44.256 --> 05:46.258
Smoke break.

05:46.302 --> 05:49.392
You lefta customer waiting?What's wrong with you?

05:49.436 --> 05:51.960
That's the thirdcustomer complaint this week.

05:52.003 --> 05:53.396
D'you even wantto be here?

05:56.834 --> 05:58.314
Mikey, hello!

05:58.358 --> 06:01.186
Hold on.
I'm thinking.

06:03.624 --> 06:05.365
Get out.

06:13.198 --> 06:15.766
You know that moment
in your life when everything
is coming together,

06:15.810 --> 06:19.640
everything is clicking,
it's all going
according to plan?

06:19.683 --> 06:22.033
That's exactly the opposite
of how I felt.

06:23.731 --> 06:27.038
Anyway, fuck it.
I had a new plan.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.489
Rick. Maserati Rick,
as we call him,

07:26.533 --> 07:28.709
is the first guy
I ever stole a car for.

07:28.752 --> 07:30.014
Hey, Mikey.

07:32.495 --> 07:35.150
He runs Good Guys Motor Sports
in the worst part of the city.

07:35.193 --> 07:39.067
If you want something done
fast and cheap,
Rick's your guy.

07:39.110 --> 07:41.765
If you want quality,
you better look elsewhere.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.245
Look what happened.

07:43.288 --> 07:46.640
The fucking shift knob
came off again.

07:46.683 --> 07:49.381
I must've threaded itthree times and it keepscoming off.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.688
Listen, can I talk
to you for a minute?

07:51.732 --> 07:54.430
Yeah, sure.
What's up, kid?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.214
I need cash.

07:56.258 --> 07:58.695
How come every timeI see you, you're broke?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.436
I got expensive tastes.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.655
You shouldn'toverextend yourself.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.178
Look, I was hoping

08:03.221 --> 08:05.876
that maybe I could help you
cop a few cars.

08:05.920 --> 08:07.791
Sure. I like when youhelp me out, kid.

08:07.835 --> 08:11.142
No, look. I mean,
like, a lot of cars.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.796
Like a lot, a lot.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.842
Okay, what are wetalking about?One a week?

08:14.885 --> 08:16.278
How about one a day?

08:16.321 --> 08:17.932
Oh,come on, kid!I wish I could.

08:17.975 --> 08:20.500
- I can't move
that many cars.
- Why not?

08:20.543 --> 08:21.892
You know how it is.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.807
You need a fence,need a network.

08:23.851 --> 08:26.854
I just don't havethose kinds of connections.

08:26.897 --> 08:28.682
Besides, I just makemoney from parts.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.775
Okay, look,why don't we try this?

08:34.818 --> 08:36.951
Let's do...two a week,

08:36.994 --> 08:39.388
and we'll take itfrom there. All right?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.697
Yeah. Okay.
All right.

08:45.568 --> 08:48.223
I was 15 years old
when I stole my first car.

08:48.266 --> 08:50.007
Me and my friend Donnie
skipped school

08:50.051 --> 08:52.880
and spent the entire day
looking for cars to steal.

08:52.923 --> 08:54.969
We'd just watched
Gone in 60 Seconds.

08:56.579 --> 08:59.060
I got one message
for society:

08:59.103 --> 09:00.540
If you don't want
to encourage crime,

09:00.583 --> 09:02.542
stop making movies about it.

09:05.370 --> 09:08.983
The moment I saw that ugly,
grey Toyota Corolla...

09:10.593 --> 09:12.377
I knew it was the one.

09:19.776 --> 09:21.082
Yo!

09:25.347 --> 09:28.916
I don't know why,
but somehow,

09:28.959 --> 09:31.179
I knew that the keys
would be in the glove box.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.409
But that wasn't
the craziest thing
I'd ever done.

09:51.155 --> 09:53.549
What are you doing?
Stop!

09:56.030 --> 09:57.553
Can you believe
I got away with it?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.685
What are you gonna do?!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.733
Well, you shouldn't.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.910
That was the first time
I ever stole a police car.

10:06.954 --> 10:08.390
But it wouldn't be my last.

10:16.833 --> 10:19.575
Rick was in the market
for certain types of cars.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.839
Evos, Subarus, Acuras,
that type of thing.

10:27.278 --> 10:30.151
Or perhaps
something like this.

10:34.677 --> 10:36.113
Forged rims? Check.

10:36.157 --> 10:38.246
Upgraded exhaust? Check.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.988
Boost gauges. Probably means
there's a supercharger

10:41.031 --> 10:43.468
or a turbo installed.
That's the ticket.

10:43.512 --> 10:45.819
Step one: Buy a slide hammer.

10:47.690 --> 10:51.172
Step two: blow the ignition and get the hell out of there.

10:57.091 --> 10:58.919
Step three: profit.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.924
How long have you been
working on this thing?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.752
I'm still working outthe kinks.

11:08.842 --> 11:10.365
Guess what I saw
the other day?

11:10.408 --> 11:14.325
- What?
- A 1965 Shelby GT Cobra.

11:23.726 --> 11:25.728
What? Not an original.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.078
Yeah. An original.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.515
Let me tell you,Mikey. You get mesomething like that,

11:30.559 --> 11:32.909
we can makesome real money.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.044
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

11:37.087 --> 11:38.219
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, you interrupted me.

11:38.262 --> 11:39.394
I didn't countproperly.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.143
One of the easiest ways
to steal someone's car...

11:50.971 --> 11:53.495
is to simply take their keys
while they're asleep.

12:04.288 --> 12:08.858
-  What is it?
- That is a 1965
Shelby GT Cobra.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.078
Just like in Bad Boys.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.820
-  One or two?
- What do you mean?

12:14.995 --> 12:16.823
Is the carfrom Bad Boys I or II?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.740
There's no Bad Boys I.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.132
There's a Bad Boys
and a Bad Boys II.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.743
Look, we don't enumerate
the first one, right?

12:23.786 --> 12:26.354
Whatever.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.921
It's probablya replica.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.010
No. I do my homework.

12:31.098 --> 12:32.839
So what do you wantfrom me?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.972
What do you mean?

12:36.016 --> 12:37.844
You're gonna help me
break into the place.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.892
No. No, no, no.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.634
Fuck that! I'm on--I'm on probation, man.

12:45.677 --> 12:47.897
- I'm not helping you
break into shit--
- Skittles, man.

12:47.941 --> 12:49.812
Do you know how much
that car is worth?

12:51.031 --> 12:53.120
- I'll give you 10%.
- No.

12:53.163 --> 12:54.774
Fifteen percent.

12:57.341 --> 12:58.690
Why are you gonna dothis here, man?

12:58.734 --> 13:00.736
Why don't you just waituntil he takes it out?

13:00.780 --> 13:05.001
Are you sh-- That car hasn't
moved from that spot
in two weeks

13:05.045 --> 13:07.787
You don't just take
a million dollar car
and drive it around the city

13:07.830 --> 13:10.615
- and park it
at a fuckin' grocery--
- A million dollars?

13:10.659 --> 13:12.792
-  Oh, shit.
- More like 500 G's.

13:12.835 --> 13:15.359
You know what I mean,
though, right?

13:15.403 --> 13:17.840
I'll retirein Miami.

13:17.884 --> 13:20.451
Just like in Bad Boys I.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.845
Fine. Here,
this is for you.

13:24.673 --> 13:27.328
Wait... wait, wait,why don't I getthe same one as yours?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.373
Man, that's all
they had.

13:29.417 --> 13:32.115
Oh, my G--Have you ever brokeninto a house before?

13:32.159 --> 13:33.595
No, that's why
I brought you along.

13:33.638 --> 13:35.379
This fuckin'stands out.

13:35.423 --> 13:37.381
- Well, do you have
your own mask?
- No.

13:37.425 --> 13:39.731
It's gonna look
fine on you.
You'll look great.

13:39.775 --> 13:41.690
Okay? Let's
fucking go, man.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.474
Fuck, man.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.825
This is why I don't likedoing work with fuckingwhite people.

13:45.868 --> 13:46.826
- Fuck this.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.177
-  Come on. Let's go.
- I can do it.

13:50.220 --> 13:52.788
- Okay. Got it.

14:05.627 --> 14:08.586
I'll never understand why people leave their car keys near the front door.

14:10.066 --> 14:11.285
Might as well leave them
in the car.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.028
All right.
I'm out.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.336
- What?
- That's it.

14:19.380 --> 14:20.903
I helped you
get in.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.992
No, no, no, no,
that's not it.
I need you.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.602
For what?!

14:25.952 --> 14:28.215
- Push!
- I'm fucking pushing.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.607
- Push harder!
- Fuck you!

14:29.651 --> 14:31.044
All right?
I'm pushing.

14:34.438 --> 14:35.962
Fuck.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.757
When you steal
a high-end car,
what you want to do

15:32.801 --> 15:34.846
is let it cool off
in a public space

15:34.890 --> 15:36.674
and come back to it
a week later.

15:36.718 --> 15:39.112
That way, if the car
is being tracked,

15:39.155 --> 15:41.201
they won't be waiting
for you when you return.

16:19.848 --> 16:22.416
- Don't fucking move!
- Get your hands in the air!

16:22.459 --> 16:24.896
- Get out of the car!
- Put your hands
in the fucking air!

16:49.878 --> 16:51.836
So I guess the car
was being tracked
after all.

16:51.880 --> 16:55.666
You've got some nerve,stealing from meon Shabbat.

16:57.059 --> 16:58.365
Oh.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.628
That was yours?

17:00.671 --> 17:03.065
See, I didn't know,
but, um... shalom,
by the way.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.285
You want me to believethis was a coincidence?

17:05.328 --> 17:07.374
With your historyof stealing cop cars?

17:07.417 --> 17:08.940
Who would have
thought that a cop

17:08.984 --> 17:11.639
could afford an authentic
Shelby Cobra, right?

17:11.682 --> 17:15.208
What do you guys make?
Fuck, get me a job here.

17:15.251 --> 17:18.950
That was an inheritancefrom my father-in-law,you prick.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.517
He passed awaylast year.

17:20.561 --> 17:23.085
My condolences.

17:23.129 --> 17:26.784
- Honestly.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.960
Evening, Mikey.

17:29.004 --> 17:33.356
I'm Detective Reid,
from the Toronto Police
auto squad.

17:33.400 --> 17:36.751
And it looks like
you're being charged
with grand theft auto

17:36.794 --> 17:40.450
of a 1965 Shelby
GT Cobra,

17:40.494 --> 17:44.280
with a value well over
$200,000.

17:44.324 --> 17:47.457
- Ooh! Nice car!
- Thank you.

17:47.501 --> 17:51.592
Uh... let's see
what else we've got.

17:51.635 --> 17:55.900
Ah... You're also
being charged
with home invasion.

17:55.944 --> 18:00.035
An indictable offense,
which carries a maximum
life sentence.

18:00.079 --> 18:03.734
Now, this sentence
is rarely, if ever,
enforced.

18:03.778 --> 18:06.955
But for you, Mikey?
We're gonna make
an exception.

18:10.393 --> 18:12.526
That was bullshit.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.354
This is no bullshit,
Mikey.

18:14.397 --> 18:18.271
We're talking
some serious,
real time in prison.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.012
Yes, you can
fight it.

18:21.056 --> 18:23.841
And we'll appeal.
We can go back
and forth,

18:23.885 --> 18:27.715
but trust me, we're going
to do everything we can

18:27.758 --> 18:30.326
to make your life
a living hell.

18:30.370 --> 18:33.851
And given your history?
It shouldn't be
that difficult.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.766
- Right?
- Absolutely.

18:37.464 --> 18:39.030
All right, why do you guys
have such a hard-on for me?

18:39.074 --> 18:40.467
'Cause I stole
from Moses over here?

18:40.510 --> 18:42.991
Listen, I didn't know,
I swear to God.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.127
Maybe you didn't know.

18:48.170 --> 18:51.173
Maybe it was
an honest mistake.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.654
What do you think,
Officer Kovitz?

18:53.697 --> 18:57.223
Is there some kind
of way that we can
work something out?

18:59.790 --> 19:01.966
I might havesome ideas.

19:17.591 --> 19:20.028
Their idea was
for me to become an agent

19:20.071 --> 19:22.987
and infiltrate one
of the biggest car theft
rings in the city.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.990
They wanted me to steal
a Lamborghini,

19:26.034 --> 19:27.644
which belonged
to the ring leader,

19:27.688 --> 19:30.169
and bring it to a chop shop
on 44th Street.

20:27.487 --> 20:29.837
Okay, bring it up,
come on.

20:29.880 --> 20:32.622
Okay, okay.
Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

20:37.453 --> 20:40.239
Okay, look,just leave it there.

20:44.460 --> 20:46.854
- You Mikey?
- Who else would I be?

20:48.856 --> 20:53.252
Look, I called him.
He's gonna be here
in about 30 minutes.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.123
You know the plan,
right?

20:55.166 --> 20:57.125
- Yeah, they told me.
- Okay, good.

20:57.168 --> 20:59.823
So...

20:59.867 --> 21:02.739
- How long have you
known me for?
- I don't know, two years?

21:02.783 --> 21:04.741
No, three. It says here
three years.

21:04.785 --> 21:05.829
- Three years.
- All right, three.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.309
- Fuck.
- Yeah, three.

21:07.353 --> 21:10.225
What kind of carsdo you steal from me?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.227
S-Class Mercedes,
mostly.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.316
Uh, high-end
luxury cars.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.450
Okay. Good, good,good, good.

21:17.493 --> 21:20.757
- Are you nervous?
Don't be nervous.
- I'm good, man.

21:20.801 --> 21:23.978
Okay, look, I seeyou've got a bitof an attitude.

21:24.021 --> 21:27.590
All right? Don't getcocky with Charlie.He doesn't like that.

21:27.634 --> 21:29.462
I just need thisto go smooth, okay?

21:29.505 --> 21:32.116
- Just... be cool.
- "Smoothly."

21:32.160 --> 21:34.858
- Huh?
- You want this
to go smoothly.

21:34.902 --> 21:37.121
Ok... uh, fuck.

21:40.037 --> 21:42.083
Hey, Charlie.

21:42.126 --> 21:44.694
Yeah, he's here,it's here...

21:44.738 --> 21:46.522
You out front? Okay. I'll come get you.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.524
Just hang on a minute.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.657
- Okay, okay.
Be there in five.

21:50.700 --> 21:52.572
Shit. I really need
to go to the bathroom.

21:52.615 --> 21:54.313
- You might wanna
put that away.
- Huh?

21:55.662 --> 21:57.054
Oh, shit!

22:04.627 --> 22:07.717
Hi. See?

22:07.761 --> 22:09.371
I went over it,
I gave it
a full inspection.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.242
Everything is
in tip-top shape.

22:11.286 --> 22:12.940
It's dirty.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.768
We'll wash it.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.465
-  You better.
- Everything.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.512
All right.
So this is the guy.

22:19.555 --> 22:21.470
Yeah, this is Mikey.

22:21.514 --> 22:25.169
I told him it belonged
to you. He-he--
he didn't know.

22:26.257 --> 22:28.434
Is that true?

22:28.477 --> 22:29.913
Yeah.

22:31.393 --> 22:33.177
So how'd you do it?

22:33.221 --> 22:35.484
Roy told me you even
disabled the LoJack.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.573
Basic, really.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.359
I used a radio hackto catch the wave signal whenyou were locking your car,

22:40.402 --> 22:42.361
and then just played it back
to unlock the doors.

22:42.404 --> 22:44.014
A code grabber?

22:44.058 --> 22:46.452
Yeah, a RollJam.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.717
Go on.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.459
I plugged ina custom ECUin the diagnostic port,

22:53.502 --> 22:55.852
disabled the anti-theft,and then all I hadto do after that

22:55.896 --> 22:57.201
was uploada pirate sofware.

22:59.203 --> 23:01.031
Who programmed
the software?

23:01.075 --> 23:02.903
I did.

23:02.946 --> 23:06.080
You?

23:06.123 --> 23:08.691
What are you,
some kind of engineer?

23:08.735 --> 23:11.215
Yeah, I know some code.
Look, are we done here?

23:11.259 --> 23:13.392
I said I was sorry,
I gave you back your car.
Can I go now?

23:14.871 --> 23:16.656
You didn't say
you were sorry.

23:16.699 --> 23:19.267
All right, well,
I'm sorry.

23:20.355 --> 23:22.313
Roy!

23:22.357 --> 23:24.751
- Where'd you find this guy?
- Oh, he...

23:24.794 --> 23:27.406
He stole my car
two years ago.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.408
Three years ago.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.413
Keep in touch.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.371
-  We good? Okay, good.
-  Yeah,
we're happy.

23:36.415 --> 23:39.679
And just like that,
I was in.

23:43.204 --> 23:45.598
You gotta admire
a guy like Charlie.

23:45.641 --> 23:49.123
He was a hustler,
a dreamer, a go-getter.

23:49.166 --> 23:51.168
Not even 30 yet,
he had his own shop,

23:51.212 --> 23:53.780
warehouse
and distribution network.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.747
Charlie had
a small team of thieves.

24:04.791 --> 24:07.141
They were notorious
for stealing high-end
luxury vehicles

24:07.184 --> 24:09.056
throughout the GTA.

24:13.321 --> 24:15.715
Charlie's operation
was like nothing
I'd ever seen before.

24:15.758 --> 24:18.326
It was organized,
proper, meticulous.

24:18.369 --> 24:20.371
During the day,
it was the usual--

24:20.415 --> 24:23.287
Insurance claims,
body repair,
that kind of thing.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.686
But at night, that's when
the real work began.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.447
All right,
strip it down, boys.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.669
His crew could strip
an entire X5

24:56.712 --> 24:58.061
in under two hours.

24:59.323 --> 25:00.716
Fucking brilliant!

25:06.592 --> 25:09.551
Are you serious?That's-that's two guysthis week.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.162
He wasn't doing
a good job, Charlie.

25:12.206 --> 25:14.904
- Oh, God! You know
he's suicidal.
- Charlie?

25:14.948 --> 25:17.080
- What?
- Sorry, Charlie.

25:17.124 --> 25:18.734
Um, the S-Class is here.
Do you want me
to bring it around?

25:18.778 --> 25:19.953
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, of course.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.477
- S-Class.
- Hey, Mikey.

25:22.521 --> 25:24.218
Get over here
for a second.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.703
Have you met Ava?

25:31.965 --> 25:34.010
- Hi.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.317
Ava, Mikey.
Mikey, Ava.

25:36.360 --> 25:37.710
Yeah, I've seen
him around.

25:37.753 --> 25:41.104
Look, I want you
to be nice to Mikey.

25:41.148 --> 25:43.324
He's a smart kid.

25:43.367 --> 25:45.761
- But I'm nice
to everyone.

25:45.805 --> 25:48.764
Seriously. I wanna
keep him around a while.

25:48.808 --> 25:50.679
Okay.

25:51.811 --> 25:53.943
Well...

25:53.987 --> 25:56.293
If you like himso much, Charlie,

25:56.337 --> 26:00.820
then why don't youinvite him to your partytonight?

26:00.863 --> 26:01.864
Yeah?

26:06.782 --> 26:08.218
What party?

26:30.458 --> 26:32.068
Mikey!

26:33.504 --> 26:34.810
We're over here.

26:41.121 --> 26:42.296
Hi, Mikey.

26:43.384 --> 26:45.168
Is that for me?

26:45.212 --> 26:48.911
Uh, yeah, uh...
I thought I should
get you something.

26:48.955 --> 26:50.043
Happy birthday, man.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.308
Oh, my God!

26:54.351 --> 26:55.657
Look at this, huh?

26:55.701 --> 26:59.095
You see this?
You see this?!

26:59.139 --> 27:01.184
It's character.

27:04.579 --> 27:05.798
Thank you.

27:07.408 --> 27:10.193
All right, let's get
this party started!

27:10.237 --> 27:11.891
Have you got somethingfor us, darling?

27:11.934 --> 27:13.327
I do!

27:19.594 --> 27:21.074
Come on, Mikey.

28:01.897 --> 28:03.769
What the fuck?

28:03.812 --> 28:05.509
Come here.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.860
You fucking monkey,
come here!

28:08.948 --> 28:10.123
What do you see?

28:12.299 --> 28:14.127
- A great fucking job.
- "A great fucking job."

28:14.170 --> 28:15.868
Fucking look
at that panel!

28:15.911 --> 28:17.696
There's a massive gap.

28:17.739 --> 28:19.959
- Who's that?

28:20.002 --> 28:21.569
It's my business
partner, Sammy.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.919
Hey, Charlie!

28:23.963 --> 28:27.053
Sammy, you can't yell
at them like that, man.
We've talked about this.

28:27.096 --> 28:29.185
Oh, don't be
such a pussy! Come here.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.189
- People take
advantage of you.
- Yeah, I know.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.452
- Who's this?
- This is Mikey.

28:35.496 --> 28:37.193
Hi, nice to meet you.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.630
Customs pulled me over.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.154
I missed my connecting flight.
Can you believe that?

28:41.197 --> 28:42.764
Why didn't you
call me?

28:42.808 --> 28:45.027
What are you,
my Mother?

28:45.071 --> 28:46.594
I was taking care
of something.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.162
Sammy just got back
from West Africa.

28:49.205 --> 28:52.034
Where did you go again?
Zimbawe?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.777
Ghana, Charlie.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.866
Zimbabwe is
in Southern Africa.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.477
Why don't you
open a book sometime,

29:00.521 --> 29:02.392
- you illiterate fucker?

29:02.436 --> 29:03.742
Sammy was
a piece of shit thug

29:03.785 --> 29:05.744
who hated me from day one.

29:05.787 --> 29:07.484
He was the type of guy
who wouldn't even
piss on you

29:07.528 --> 29:08.703
if you were on fire.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.107
Move it!
You can't park there!

29:24.675 --> 29:25.894
Hey! Can youmove your car?

29:28.462 --> 29:30.507
- What?
- Motherfucker!

29:31.726 --> 29:33.815
- Fuck!

29:39.647 --> 29:41.649
This is it.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.086
- This is massive, Sammy.
- Mm. Yeah.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.654
What do you expect?
Guy's a fuckin'
millionaire.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.094
I'm gonna take
a piss.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.885
What's the deal
with him?

29:59.928 --> 30:01.408
He's cool, man.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.194
How long have youknown him for?

30:05.238 --> 30:07.022
Don't worry about Mikey.

30:07.066 --> 30:08.458
I trust him, just...

30:08.502 --> 30:09.851
Tell me about the deal.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.335
You know, not all thievescan be trusted, Charlie.

30:17.641 --> 30:19.469
How is it gonna work?

30:19.513 --> 30:21.689
We get a listevery week.

30:21.732 --> 30:24.300
We steal the cars,
we get them
through Customs,

30:24.344 --> 30:26.389
they handle the shippingand delivery,

30:26.433 --> 30:28.391
we get paid.Simple as that.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.742
Okay, what's his name?

30:36.269 --> 30:38.271
No. We'll talk
about it later.

30:38.314 --> 30:41.448
No, no, no, no.
I wanna talk
about it now.

30:41.491 --> 30:44.320
Who is he?

30:44.364 --> 30:47.976
I don't fuckingknow this guy.

30:48.020 --> 30:51.023
I'm vouching for Mikey.
Tell me his fucking name!

30:52.241 --> 30:55.201
His nameis Koflex.

30:55.244 --> 30:57.986
And let me tell you,Charlie, this isgonna change everything.

30:58.030 --> 31:01.337
He's got multiple buyersand they're all flush.

31:01.381 --> 31:05.037
Ministers, politicians,warlords.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.126
They all havevery exotic tastes.

31:08.127 --> 31:10.085
Like what?

31:10.129 --> 31:12.131
Lamborghinis,
Ferraris,

31:12.174 --> 31:14.698
McLarens, Jags.
Everything,
anything.

31:16.439 --> 31:18.572
It's not just a country,
Charlie.

31:18.615 --> 31:20.966
It's an entire
fucking region.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.099
All of West Africa.

31:24.143 --> 31:25.622
It's gonna be ours.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.712
How much are we
talking about here?

31:30.366 --> 31:33.239
Fuckin' millions!

32:03.965 --> 32:06.446
You tell me
you've never been
in a threesome?

32:06.489 --> 32:08.752
- No, it's not really my--
- What are you,
some fucking Victorian nun?

32:08.796 --> 32:10.929
- Ugh.

32:13.322 --> 32:15.107
Hey. Mikey.

32:18.501 --> 32:20.590
Boys...

32:20.634 --> 32:23.724
We're gonna be
every insurance company's
worst fucking nightmare!

32:23.767 --> 32:25.552
Fucking right!

32:25.595 --> 32:27.249
- Fuck 'em!
Fuck 'em!

32:31.340 --> 32:35.518
Mikey, I want you to know
that you're part
of something big.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.173
We're expanding
the business.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.914
And I want you to be
my right hand guy.

32:43.048 --> 32:45.006
Charlie, I don't knowwhat to say, man, that's--

32:45.050 --> 32:46.616
- Don't say anything, man--
-  Charlie!

32:49.402 --> 32:50.664
What's up, Dutch?

32:52.840 --> 32:55.756
- Is that how you treat
a friend?
- What do you mean?

32:55.799 --> 32:58.498
- What do I mean?
- Why don't you
fuck off, Dutch, huh?

32:58.541 --> 33:01.849
- Koflex works with us now.
- Shut the fuck up, Sammy!

33:01.892 --> 33:03.459
I expect this shit
from you.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.071
But you?

33:08.203 --> 33:11.119
You go behind my back
after all the fucking money
that I made you?

33:11.163 --> 33:12.816
It's just business,
Dutch. Come on.

33:12.860 --> 33:14.427
- Koflex was my contact.
- Yeah?

33:14.470 --> 33:16.690
Well, he's ours now.

33:16.733 --> 33:18.779
So why don't you take
your janky-ass chain

33:18.822 --> 33:20.607
- and get the fuck
out of here?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

33:20.650 --> 33:23.392
Sammy, Sammy, Sammy.
Relax, okay?

33:23.436 --> 33:25.612
Hey, maybe we can
work something out.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.092
Ain't shit
to work out, bro.

33:27.135 --> 33:29.746
- Come on.
- Look.

33:29.790 --> 33:33.794
Africa is mine.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.945
Don't worry about it,
Sammy. We're gonna
work it out, okay?

33:54.989 --> 33:56.599
I'm not worried.

33:56.643 --> 33:59.907
And you're goddamn right
we're gonna work it out.

34:09.308 --> 34:11.092
I didn't sweat my balls off

34:11.136 --> 34:13.964
in that malaria-infested
hellhole for nothing!

34:14.008 --> 34:15.575
Charlie?

34:35.508 --> 34:36.944
You see?

34:38.163 --> 34:40.078
That's what happens.

34:46.736 --> 34:48.564
That was the thing
about Charlie.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.872
He loved that girl to death.

34:54.309 --> 34:57.269
Sammy.
Sammy what?

34:58.835 --> 35:01.664
I don't know,
I never got
a last name.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.753
Tell me
about this deal again.

35:03.797 --> 35:06.408
They wanna move50 cars a month.

35:06.452 --> 35:08.062
Charlie put me in chargeof exotic cars.

35:09.542 --> 35:11.152
Where? Africa?

35:12.762 --> 35:15.635
Yeah. Ghana.

35:15.678 --> 35:18.116
Okay.
So who's the fence?

35:21.162 --> 35:23.686
His name is Koflex.

35:26.472 --> 35:30.954
A fence is a person
who buys stolen goods
and resells them.

35:30.998 --> 35:34.001
He's basically a sales rep,
a middleman,

35:34.044 --> 35:36.960
a way for Charlie to get
his stolen cars
off the streets

35:37.004 --> 35:38.962
and onto the shores
of Africa.

35:43.924 --> 35:46.927
- Yes.
-  Koflex.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.885
- Dutch.
- Brother.

35:48.929 --> 35:51.366
Why are you workingwith them white boys?

35:51.410 --> 35:54.239
I need product,
Dutch.

35:54.282 --> 35:56.719
My buyers don't care
where it comes from.

35:56.763 --> 35:58.112
Yeah, but whywouldn't you ask me?

35:58.156 --> 36:00.810
Because I didn't think
you can deliver.

36:00.854 --> 36:03.030
And who said that?Sammy?

36:03.073 --> 36:04.901
Those guys are fucking crooks!

36:04.945 --> 36:07.991
Look, you just tell mewhat you need, Koflex.

36:08.035 --> 36:11.299
All right.
I need Ferraris.

36:11.343 --> 36:12.474
No problem.

36:12.518 --> 36:14.824
- Ten of them.
- Sure.

36:14.868 --> 36:16.043
A month.

36:19.089 --> 36:22.005
Okay.

36:22.049 --> 36:25.618
My clients are not
the kind of people
you want to cross, Dutch.

36:25.661 --> 36:29.622
If you don't deliver,
they'll give your wife
to the soldiers.

36:31.014 --> 36:32.190
Just break your dealwith those crackers, man.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.148
I'll get youthe fucking cars.

36:34.192 --> 36:36.063
- I can't fucking
believe this!
-  I told you.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.804
I told you that bastard
was gonna fuck up
our deal.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.067
- Sammy, we're gonna
go talk to him.
- No.

36:40.110 --> 36:42.896
I'm fucking done talking,
Charlie. You can't reason
with these roaches.

36:42.939 --> 36:44.376
They gotta learn to stay
out of our business.

36:45.942 --> 36:47.727
Jesus, Sammy! We're not
gonna kill the fuck.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.208
- Intimidation, Charlie.
Here.

36:53.646 --> 36:55.038
Are you part of this
or not?

37:17.844 --> 37:19.106
Dutch!

37:21.326 --> 37:22.805
Get out here,you cunt!

37:29.159 --> 37:31.118
Back off.

37:34.600 --> 37:36.863
Dutch!

37:36.906 --> 37:38.560
Have a seat.

37:41.476 --> 37:44.827
Couldn't keep your nose
out of my fucking business,
could you, Dutch?

37:44.871 --> 37:48.309
It was my businessto begin with.

37:49.528 --> 37:50.790
Yeah.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.141
- Hey, Charlie...
- Hmm?

37:54.184 --> 37:55.229
See that drill
over there?

37:56.839 --> 38:00.103
Be a dear and hand it
to me, please.

38:08.677 --> 38:10.288
The fuck's he gonna do
with that shit?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.724
You can't fuck with us.

38:27.566 --> 38:29.132
Yes, Dutch.

38:29.176 --> 38:32.571
Koflex, I can't get you
the cars anymore.

38:33.963 --> 38:35.008
Why not?

38:36.792 --> 38:40.666
It turns out I have
a bit of a...
health problem.

38:42.842 --> 38:46.585
- I'm sorry to hear that, Dutch.- I've thought about it and...

38:46.628 --> 38:48.978
I think you're better offwith Charlie and Sammy.

38:52.591 --> 38:56.029
Okay. Feel better.

39:08.389 --> 39:11.392
In Sub-Saharan countries like Nigeria, Ghana,

39:11.436 --> 39:13.916
Guinea, Sierra Leone
and Gambia,

39:13.960 --> 39:16.266
the demand for high-end cars
was booming...

39:18.007 --> 39:19.792
driven by cash-rich
drug dealers,

39:19.835 --> 39:22.838
corrupt politicians
and egotistical warlords.

39:22.882 --> 39:27.582
A brand new McLaren
was the ultimate
status symbol.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.542
Most companies don't even
set up shop in this part
of the world.

39:30.585 --> 39:34.589
So if you want the latest
Porsche GT3 or Benz,
you have to import it.

39:34.633 --> 39:36.199
That's where we come in.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.811
Why spend 400K
on a brand new Hurricane

39:38.854 --> 39:41.379
when you can get the same car
for half the price?

39:44.599 --> 39:47.080
Charlie's operation
ran like clockwork.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.125
Koflex sent us a list
of in-demand cars

39:49.169 --> 39:51.693
and we stole
every single one of them.

39:51.737 --> 39:53.956
There are many ways
to steal a car.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.306
The simplest being
a good, old-fashioned
carjacking...

39:57.656 --> 39:58.874
which I was never
a fan of.

39:58.918 --> 40:00.223
I'll fucking shoot you!

40:00.267 --> 40:02.138
Get the fuck out!

40:13.149 --> 40:14.716
There were
dealership scams,

40:14.760 --> 40:16.457
where we would ask
for a test drive,

40:16.501 --> 40:18.416
snap a photo
of the keys,

40:18.459 --> 40:20.330
and create a replica later.

40:31.167 --> 40:34.475
Then another one of us
would come back,
pretending to be a customer,

40:34.519 --> 40:36.434
and swap the keys.

40:36.477 --> 40:39.785
By the time the dealer
realized they now had
a fake set,

40:39.828 --> 40:41.874
the car was already
in Charlie's warehouse.

40:47.357 --> 40:50.099
We even had people in the MTO, who got us duplicate plates

40:50.143 --> 40:53.712
that matched the exact make,
model and color
of the cars we stole.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.629
So if a cop ever spotted
a runner and ran the plates,

40:57.672 --> 40:59.326
everything checked out.

40:59.369 --> 41:00.588
Here you go, sir.

41:01.807 --> 41:02.938
Have a great day.

41:10.250 --> 41:12.687
And then,
there was my specialty.

41:20.826 --> 41:23.481
Hacking the car's
anti-theft system,

41:23.524 --> 41:26.353
driving it underground,
where it became
invisible to satellites,

41:26.396 --> 41:29.182
and taking my time to disable the tracking device.

42:03.564 --> 42:04.957
Next came retagging.

42:06.872 --> 42:10.919
We'd forge new VIN numbers,
vehicle history and titles.

42:10.963 --> 42:13.356
We had folders full
of fake customs documents,

42:13.400 --> 42:16.577
manifests, everything
you'd need to make
a car disappear.

42:48.609 --> 42:50.393
Koflex couldn't be happier.

42:50.437 --> 42:53.440
Anything he wanted,
Charlie delivered.

43:19.031 --> 43:22.948
We were moving nearly
$1 million's worth
of cars a month.

43:22.991 --> 43:26.516
If you're wondering
what kind of lifestyle
that affords...

43:26.560 --> 43:27.866
it's a great one.

43:51.280 --> 43:54.153
Hey, Mikey.
Pass me the towel?

44:25.271 --> 44:27.882
- Sammy.
- Hey.

44:27.926 --> 44:30.015
I'd like to talk to youfor a moment.

44:31.103 --> 44:32.931
Right now?

44:32.974 --> 44:34.802
Right now.

44:36.891 --> 44:38.066
All right.

44:52.559 --> 44:54.213
Oh, Sammy...

44:55.693 --> 44:57.782
Did you look
into it yet?

44:57.825 --> 45:00.393
Not yet, not yet.

45:00.436 --> 45:03.570
I need to know
soon, Sammy.

45:03.613 --> 45:06.051
I can't waste
any more time.

45:06.094 --> 45:09.924
I know. I know.
I'm working on it.

45:09.968 --> 45:13.449
My buyers want to move
on this as soon
as possible.

45:14.799 --> 45:17.758
If you can't deliver,
let me know now.

45:17.802 --> 45:20.369
Don't drag this out.

45:20.413 --> 45:21.675
I can deliver.

45:23.677 --> 45:26.288
I just need
a little time.

45:26.332 --> 45:27.725
Give me
until next week.

45:27.768 --> 45:28.987
Hmm.

45:31.641 --> 45:33.252
Next week.

45:48.049 --> 45:49.834
You know...

45:49.877 --> 45:53.881
Charlie really
likes you, Mikey.

45:55.927 --> 45:57.319
Yeah, I like him too.

45:57.363 --> 45:59.234
As a friend, of course.
He's all yours.

46:02.629 --> 46:04.152
But...

46:04.196 --> 46:05.675
seriously.

46:07.634 --> 46:09.505
He really trusts you.

46:09.549 --> 46:11.029
Yeah, I know.

46:19.777 --> 46:21.822
We'll have to be careful.

46:24.869 --> 46:26.305
Boo!

46:28.176 --> 46:30.483
Hey, have you guys
seen Sammy?

46:30.526 --> 46:33.312
- Uh, no.
- Tsk.

46:33.355 --> 46:34.835
He's always running off,
that Sammy.

46:34.879 --> 46:36.619
He's like the fucking
Road Runner, you know?

46:37.795 --> 46:39.666
Can you pass methat magazine, love?

46:45.585 --> 46:46.847
Can you believe this?

46:46.891 --> 46:50.068
This is what she reads.
Drifting.

46:50.111 --> 46:52.984
Honestly, you see
a girl like this...

46:53.027 --> 46:54.768
A car magazine
is the last thing

46:54.812 --> 46:56.509
you expect her
to be reading, right?

46:56.552 --> 46:59.077
Why don't you just
be honest with yourself,
Charlie,

46:59.120 --> 47:01.644
and admit that you
hate drifting and you
hate drift cars?

47:03.559 --> 47:06.084
- I do. I do,
I hate them!
- Why?

47:06.127 --> 47:09.000
Sliding around,burning tires.

47:09.043 --> 47:10.349
It's a stupid waste of money.

47:10.392 --> 47:13.831
No, I disagree.
No, drifting is...

47:13.874 --> 47:15.702
It's graceful.
It's like dancing.

47:15.745 --> 47:18.444
You know, you have to improviseevery single timeyou miss a step.

47:18.487 --> 47:20.620
It's... chaotic,
but precise.

47:20.663 --> 47:23.318
It's... it's poetry
in motion.

47:23.362 --> 47:24.624
Thank you.

47:27.932 --> 47:30.935
I actually run laps
at the track sometimes.
You guys should come.

47:30.978 --> 47:33.285
I'm not gonna watch you
waste a nice set of tires.

47:33.328 --> 47:34.764
I'll come.

47:36.462 --> 47:40.031
Mikey...
I'm telling you.

47:40.074 --> 47:43.861
She can come watch,
but don't let her
get behind the wheel.

47:43.904 --> 47:44.992
She sucks.

47:54.959 --> 47:56.003
Boost gauge.

47:57.048 --> 47:59.398
Oil temperature.
Speed.

47:59.441 --> 48:01.661
Start off
with the clutch kick
like we talked about.

48:01.704 --> 48:04.838
You can come into the turn
at any speed that way.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.927
It'll help you
build our confidence.

48:06.971 --> 48:09.582
Nice and slow,
okay?

49:04.202 --> 49:06.595
She's fucking incredible!

49:06.639 --> 49:07.640
Yeah.

49:09.381 --> 49:11.035
Is she your girl?

49:15.778 --> 49:17.171
Yeah.

50:04.436 --> 50:06.351
There's nothing to eat in here.

50:06.394 --> 50:08.092
Well, I've been busy.

50:09.963 --> 50:12.618
I'd been busy all right.
Between talking to the cops,

50:12.661 --> 50:15.708
keeping Sammy off my back
and stealing for Charlie,

50:15.751 --> 50:18.189
I had a lot on my plate.

50:18.232 --> 50:20.234
This was the last thing
I neeeded.

50:23.237 --> 50:24.630
But that ass, though...

50:27.502 --> 50:29.374
I'm hungry.

50:34.422 --> 50:36.033
Are you ready to go?

50:52.701 --> 50:54.442
- Fuck.
- What?

50:54.486 --> 50:55.878
It's Sammy.

50:55.922 --> 50:57.402
One second.

50:58.664 --> 51:01.754
Relax. We-we just
had breakfast.

51:03.669 --> 51:06.280
Well, well. What are
you two doing here?

51:06.324 --> 51:07.934
We just had breakfast.

51:07.977 --> 51:10.502
We were actually just
on our way to the scrapyard,

51:10.545 --> 51:12.678
- to get the new VIN numbers.
- Is that a fact?

51:12.721 --> 51:15.028
Hmm. What are you
doing here, Sammy?

51:16.508 --> 51:17.857
Are you working
with Dutch again?

51:19.511 --> 51:21.556
Dutch?

51:21.600 --> 51:24.385
No. We're just
having breakfast.

51:24.429 --> 51:27.736
Well, enjoy.
We will see you
later, Sammy.

51:31.958 --> 51:34.526
You know, Charlie...

51:34.569 --> 51:36.136
He's not really
a breakfast guy.

51:36.180 --> 51:40.097
Why don't we keep
this place our little secret?

51:40.140 --> 51:43.012
We wouldn't want him
to feel left out.

51:49.802 --> 51:52.152
Where were we?

51:52.196 --> 51:54.198
I'm not helping you,
Sammy.

51:54.241 --> 51:56.069
And I'm not asking
for your help.

51:56.113 --> 51:57.766
I'm asking
for your collaboration.

51:57.810 --> 51:59.942
Those aretwo different things.

52:03.163 --> 52:05.383
There's good money
to be made here.

52:05.426 --> 52:08.255
Can you do itor not, huh?

52:08.299 --> 52:10.562
- Can I do it?
- Yeah.

52:11.780 --> 52:14.740
The cars?
That's your thing.

52:15.741 --> 52:17.003
I admit that.

52:18.918 --> 52:20.093
But this is my territory.

52:22.182 --> 52:23.836
How do I know
you won't fuck me?

52:23.879 --> 52:26.621
You get your money
upfront.

52:26.665 --> 52:28.145
No funny business.

52:28.188 --> 52:29.320
You know the drill.

52:34.977 --> 52:39.678
You better know what you're
fucking doing, man.

52:39.721 --> 52:43.334
These guys know
all the tricks.
They know where to look.

52:43.377 --> 52:45.118
You can't just ship
the product like that.

52:45.162 --> 52:47.207
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Fuck, he whines
like a woman.

52:47.251 --> 52:49.253
Just get back to me
when you have a number, okay?

52:49.296 --> 52:51.211
And what about your partner?

52:51.255 --> 52:52.734
Charlie?

52:55.955 --> 52:57.391
He'll come around.

53:13.015 --> 53:14.930
- Hello?
- Where the fuck are you?

53:14.974 --> 53:18.499
I'm taking the Jag
to the yard,
just like you said.

53:18.543 --> 53:21.110
Oh, like I said. You were
supposed to be there
two fucking hours ago!

53:21.154 --> 53:22.808
You missed the shipment!

53:22.851 --> 53:25.114
Now I gotta pay for an extra week of storage.

53:25.158 --> 53:26.681
- I'm so sorry, Charlie--
- You're sorry,

53:26.725 --> 53:28.901
I'm sorry,
everybody's sorry.

53:28.944 --> 53:30.990
First, Ava takes the day off out of the fucking blue,

53:31.033 --> 53:33.122
then Sammy disappears, like he always does,

53:33.166 --> 53:35.081
and now you!

53:35.124 --> 53:37.039
- I got tied up.
- Oh, you're tied up?!

53:37.083 --> 53:39.477
I feel like I'm running
this entire operation
by myself!

53:39.520 --> 53:41.783
Well, what can I do?

53:41.827 --> 53:44.351
Just get the car over there

53:44.395 --> 53:47.224
and tell Gordie to store it for the next shipment.

53:47.267 --> 53:49.574
Whatever you want.
Whatever you want, Charlie.

53:51.315 --> 53:54.056
Sometimes I wonder
if I made the right choice,

53:54.100 --> 53:56.494
if I was better off
keeping my day job.

53:56.537 --> 54:00.193
I'd be home right now,
playing videogames
instead of living in one.

54:00.237 --> 54:03.283
At least then,
I'd be able to turn it off.

54:53.464 --> 54:55.204
What else did you see?

54:56.510 --> 54:57.772
Nothing, all right?
That's it.

54:57.816 --> 54:59.296
Just Sammy, Koflex
and the drugs.

54:59.339 --> 55:00.558
And Dutch
was there too.

55:01.863 --> 55:03.691
No! What would he
be doing there?

55:03.735 --> 55:06.215
But you didsee him earlier.

55:06.259 --> 55:08.566
Yeah, I did.
At breakfast,
with Sammy.

55:08.609 --> 55:11.220
- Are you guys
following me?
- Of course!

55:11.264 --> 55:12.352
Tell us more
about the drugs.

55:12.396 --> 55:13.832
What was it?
Meth? Coke?

55:13.875 --> 55:16.182
- Heroin?
- Man, I don't know.

55:16.225 --> 55:18.053
All right? I don't know
anything about drugs.

55:18.097 --> 55:19.925
Listen, I am donewith this shit.

55:19.968 --> 55:22.319
- This is not what I
signed up for.
- No, you're not.

55:22.362 --> 55:24.059
Look at me.

55:24.103 --> 55:26.714
You are an agent.
You work for us.

55:26.758 --> 55:28.760
But I gave you everything
that you wanted,
all right?

55:28.803 --> 55:31.110
I don't know anything else.
This is it, this is
the operation.

55:31.153 --> 55:32.416
Just go in there
and bust them already.

55:32.459 --> 55:35.419
What you saw today
was the operation.

55:37.290 --> 55:38.813
That's what wehave been waiting for.

55:38.857 --> 55:42.121
You think we give a fuck
about a car theft ring?

55:42.164 --> 55:43.905
Your buddies Charlie
and Sammy

55:43.949 --> 55:46.517
are working
with an international
drug smuggler.

55:46.560 --> 55:48.475
No. Not Charlie.

55:48.519 --> 55:50.259
- Yes. Charlie.
- No.

55:50.303 --> 55:52.218
All right?
I know him.

55:52.261 --> 55:54.481
He wouldn't get involved
with something like this.

55:54.525 --> 55:56.440
You just keep
your eyes open.

55:57.658 --> 55:59.399
Are you crazy?

55:59.443 --> 56:01.923
I can't go back
in there, all right?
Sammy saw me!

56:01.967 --> 56:03.403
That guy is
a fucking psychopath!

56:03.447 --> 56:05.362
He drills people's dicks,
for Christ's sake!

56:05.405 --> 56:08.060
So? You saw him
with a little bit of coke.

56:08.103 --> 56:11.716
So what? You're
Charlie's boy,
aren't you?

56:11.759 --> 56:14.458
He won't let anythinghappen to you.

56:14.501 --> 56:15.981
I want out.

56:16.024 --> 56:17.504
All right?
I want out.

56:17.548 --> 56:18.984
I've had enough.

56:19.027 --> 56:21.116
All I did was steal
a fucking car.

56:24.598 --> 56:26.295
I want to show you
something.

56:27.601 --> 56:30.648
I got this thing
off of eBay,

56:30.691 --> 56:33.259
- and it is amazing!

56:33.302 --> 56:35.479
The pictures, so clear.

56:35.522 --> 56:38.177
Now, I'm not a professional
and I barely know
how to use it,

56:38.220 --> 56:39.744
but I am learning.

56:39.787 --> 56:41.963
- Oh...

56:42.007 --> 56:45.358
See? That's my cat,
Callie.

56:45.402 --> 56:47.534
Oh, so cute!

56:47.578 --> 56:50.232
And that,
that one's a bird.

56:50.276 --> 56:52.365
Don't know how I took it.

56:52.409 --> 56:55.063
Oh, but these...

56:55.107 --> 56:57.065
I'm so proud of these.

56:57.109 --> 57:00.286
It's a sunset.
So beautiful...

57:01.461 --> 57:02.810
Check these out.

57:08.555 --> 57:11.384
Mm. Heh.

57:39.368 --> 57:41.240
Why are you following me?

57:47.376 --> 57:49.204
Yes, you are.Don't fucking lie to me.

57:50.641 --> 57:52.599
I saw youat the container yard.

57:52.643 --> 57:55.515
Yeah, I was delivering
a car for Charlie.

57:57.822 --> 57:59.563
What did you see?

57:59.606 --> 58:02.566
Nothing. Just you
and Koflex in the office.

58:04.872 --> 58:06.308
What else?

58:11.139 --> 58:14.186
You know, I don'tlike you, Mikey.

58:15.579 --> 58:18.190
Not one little bit.

58:20.932 --> 58:22.629
But Charlie does.

58:22.673 --> 58:24.718
It'd be a shame if somethingwere to change his mind.

58:24.762 --> 58:26.198
You know what I mean?

58:32.465 --> 58:34.423
I found these on my way in.

58:36.034 --> 58:37.949
You might want to givethese back to Ava.

58:58.665 --> 59:00.275
I'm coming!

59:03.278 --> 59:04.541
What?

59:06.891 --> 59:08.849
Hey. What's up,
Charlie?

59:08.893 --> 59:10.547
Get your shit.
Let's go.

59:11.548 --> 59:12.897
Where are we going?

59:12.940 --> 59:15.116
Don't ask questions.
Just hurry the fuck up.

59:16.117 --> 59:17.554
Yeah.

59:53.807 --> 59:56.984
So what are we
doing here, Charlie?
What's going on?

59:59.204 --> 1:00:02.381
You know, Sammy
always told me
I was...

1:00:02.424 --> 1:00:04.470
too soft,

1:00:04.513 --> 1:00:07.299
that I trust
a little too easily.

1:00:08.909 --> 1:00:10.389
And you know what?

1:00:11.825 --> 1:00:13.000
Maybe...

1:00:14.523 --> 1:00:16.525
Maybe he was rightall along.

1:00:18.223 --> 1:00:19.964
So what's happening?
What's the problem?

1:00:20.007 --> 1:00:22.923
Why don't you tell uswhat the problem is,Michael?

1:00:24.708 --> 1:00:26.231
I don't know
what you mean.

1:00:26.274 --> 1:00:29.277
Yes, you do.Sammy told meeverything.

1:00:33.978 --> 1:00:35.588
I just wantto hear it from you.

1:00:37.721 --> 1:00:41.159
- What do you want me to say?
- I want you
to tell me the truth.

1:00:41.202 --> 1:00:44.162
You've been goingbehind my back.

1:00:45.554 --> 1:00:47.644
What?

1:00:47.687 --> 1:00:49.123
Think I wasn't gonna
find out, huh?

1:00:49.167 --> 1:00:51.212
Charlie, man,
I am so sorry, okay?

1:00:51.256 --> 1:00:53.867
- I mean--
- What are you
sorry for, Mikey?

1:00:56.174 --> 1:00:58.785
I'll show you
what he's sorry for.

1:01:12.756 --> 1:01:16.455
- What the fuck is that?
- Oh, that?

1:01:16.498 --> 1:01:20.372
That is Sammy and Mikey's
new business.

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:22.853
At least Sammy had the ballsto come clean.

1:01:24.724 --> 1:01:27.858
How long were you
gonna keep this
a secret from me?

1:01:27.901 --> 1:01:29.294
Charlie, look,
I don't know...

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:32.732
I don't think I can ever
trust you again, Mikey.

1:01:32.776 --> 1:01:35.996
Whatever it is you guysgot going on with Koflex,

1:01:36.040 --> 1:01:37.215
count me out.

1:01:37.258 --> 1:01:39.696
Ava, let's getthe fuck out of here.

1:01:43.134 --> 1:01:44.570
You can't do that,
Charlie.

1:01:51.446 --> 1:01:53.187
What?

1:01:53.231 --> 1:01:54.623
I said you
can't do that.

1:01:56.190 --> 1:01:57.757
You threatening me,
Sammy?

1:01:58.802 --> 1:02:00.368
No.

1:02:00.412 --> 1:02:01.935
It's not me
you should be
worried about.

1:02:01.979 --> 1:02:03.328
- No?
- No.

1:02:04.808 --> 1:02:06.505
Who should I be
worried about, then?

1:02:06.548 --> 1:02:08.768
Well...

1:02:08.812 --> 1:02:11.118
the African
fucking warlords, brother.

1:02:11.162 --> 1:02:13.251
Who do you think
we're dealing with
here, huh?

1:02:14.774 --> 1:02:17.777
What the fuck have yougotten us into, Sammy?

1:02:17.821 --> 1:02:19.474
You wanted to expand.

1:02:19.518 --> 1:02:22.086
Remember? We were gonna
take over the world,
you and me.

1:02:22.129 --> 1:02:23.827
Not like this.

1:02:23.870 --> 1:02:25.176
Listen...

1:02:26.830 --> 1:02:29.876
If we don't give
Koflex what he wants,

1:02:29.920 --> 1:02:33.184
it's gonna cost us
a lot more than money.
You feel me?

1:02:35.926 --> 1:02:38.624
You've been planning this
since Africa, haven't you?

1:02:39.843 --> 1:02:41.148
Yeah.

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.890
Motherfuckers.

1:02:43.934 --> 1:02:45.805
Both of you.

1:02:45.849 --> 1:02:49.678
- Charlie, come on!
- Shut the fuck up,
okay, Sammy?

1:02:49.722 --> 1:02:51.637
You're acting soft again!

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.296
We're gonna
figure this out.

1:03:46.866 --> 1:03:49.347
I should haveseen this coming.

1:03:49.390 --> 1:03:52.350
That deal?Too good to be true.

1:03:56.354 --> 1:03:57.616
It's not your fault.

1:03:59.923 --> 1:04:01.925
You only see
the best in people.

1:04:08.018 --> 1:04:12.022
I'm gonna go to the store.
You need anything?

1:04:12.065 --> 1:04:14.024
- No, I'm okay. Thanks.
- Okay.

1:04:42.139 --> 1:04:43.705
I can't believe you,Mikey.

1:04:45.229 --> 1:04:47.796
- Who do you think you are?
- Are you serious?

1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:49.407
I can't believe
that you actually...

1:04:49.450 --> 1:04:51.626
- You fucking lied to us!
- You don't understand.

1:04:51.670 --> 1:04:53.846
I had nothing to do
with this. Sammy
is setting me up.

1:04:53.890 --> 1:04:55.935
That's bullshit! You knewabout the fuckin' drugs!

1:04:55.979 --> 1:04:58.938
Yeah, I did. I knew
about the drugs.
But I'm not involved.

1:04:58.982 --> 1:05:00.722
- I caught Sammy
and Koflax making plans.
- Okay...

1:05:00.766 --> 1:05:01.898
I caught them making plans,
all right?

1:05:01.941 --> 1:05:03.290
Then why didn't yousay something?

1:05:03.334 --> 1:05:05.031
- Because!
- Why didn't you tell Charlie?

1:05:09.775 --> 1:05:12.517
'Cause Sammy knows
about us.

1:05:12.560 --> 1:05:14.519
What?

1:05:14.562 --> 1:05:16.608
After I caught him,
he broke in
and he found these.

1:05:19.089 --> 1:05:20.655
Fuck.

1:05:21.743 --> 1:05:22.962
What are we
gonna do?

1:05:24.007 --> 1:05:25.269
I don't know.

1:05:27.358 --> 1:05:29.316
All right, okay.
I'll think of something.

1:05:30.317 --> 1:05:32.189
Yeah, you better.

1:05:34.147 --> 1:05:36.193
But there wasn't much
to think about.

1:05:36.236 --> 1:05:39.196
Sammy had us all cornered.
I was walking a tightrope.

1:05:39.239 --> 1:05:42.982
Drug smuggling,
African warlords,
federal fucking agents...

1:05:43.026 --> 1:05:45.245
What the fuck was I thinking?

1:05:45.289 --> 1:05:46.943
I wish I had gone to prison.

1:05:49.989 --> 1:05:51.425
What is all this?

1:05:54.385 --> 1:05:59.042
This is the mess you
and Pablo fucking Junior
over there got me into.

1:06:41.258 --> 1:06:42.824
Hey, partner.

1:06:45.871 --> 1:06:48.395
So... what do you think?

1:06:50.528 --> 1:06:52.486
Where are you gonna
put all this, Sammy?

1:06:52.530 --> 1:06:55.402
Where? Everywhere!

1:06:55.446 --> 1:06:59.363
I'll put it in the seats,the floors, the panels,the roof. Fuck it!

1:06:59.406 --> 1:07:01.539
We'll put it
in the goddamn
engine block.

1:07:01.582 --> 1:07:03.149
- Jesus Christ.

1:07:08.198 --> 1:07:09.851
Be honest with me.

1:07:11.897 --> 1:07:13.681
She's a freakin the bedroom,isn't she?

1:07:18.251 --> 1:07:19.687
Good for you.

1:07:24.997 --> 1:07:28.174
I wish I was a polygamist so
I could marry each and every
one of you ladies.

1:07:44.930 --> 1:07:46.801
Welcome, Michael.

1:07:46.845 --> 1:07:50.805
This is Michael Braley,our man inside,everyone.

1:07:50.849 --> 1:07:52.068
Have a seat.

1:07:53.156 --> 1:07:54.940
Get the lights,please.

1:07:58.726 --> 1:08:00.772
This is Koflex Odemene.

1:08:00.815 --> 1:08:04.167
A Nigerian-born refugee,and former member of LRA,

1:08:04.210 --> 1:08:06.517
Lord's Resistance Armyof Uganda.

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.128
He's a reputed
drug smuggler,

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:12.088
and internationalarms dealer.

1:08:12.131 --> 1:08:14.220
- Koflex is working
with this man.

1:08:16.135 --> 1:08:17.528
Sammy Olinsky,

1:08:17.571 --> 1:08:21.488
one of the partnersof a global car theft ring,

1:08:21.532 --> 1:08:26.232
involved in hundredsof stolen exoticand high-end luxury vehicles

1:08:26.276 --> 1:08:29.279
being shipped to severalcountries in West Africa.

1:08:29.322 --> 1:08:32.630
- This is Charlie Rivera.

1:08:32.673 --> 1:08:35.459
Any luxury car stolen
in the GTA

1:08:35.502 --> 1:08:37.113
can be traced backto this man.

1:08:38.549 --> 1:08:41.291
We have intel that these menare set to make

1:08:41.334 --> 1:08:43.380
the largest shipmentof narcotics

1:08:43.423 --> 1:08:46.165
that this departmenthas ever seen.

1:08:46.209 --> 1:08:50.169
We believe the group will use
several high-end vehicles
to conceal the shipment.

1:08:50.213 --> 1:08:53.041
The cars will be loadedinto shipping containers

1:08:53.085 --> 1:08:56.523
and will await transportat this location.

1:08:58.873 --> 1:09:02.138
Now I will hand it overto Squad Leader Sgt. Davidson

1:09:02.181 --> 1:09:04.227
who will walk usthrough the sting operation.

1:09:04.270 --> 1:09:06.490
Sgt. Davidson.

1:09:06.533 --> 1:09:08.144
Thank you, Detective.

1:09:10.058 --> 1:09:12.452
A week from now,
we'll be executing
a search warrant

1:09:12.496 --> 1:09:15.934
for Det. Reid at Koflex'sshipping yard.

1:09:15.977 --> 1:09:19.546
It will be a night raid
set for 0100 hours.

1:09:19.590 --> 1:09:22.549
We'll be entering
onto the property
in three teams--

1:09:22.593 --> 1:09:25.204
one from the north,
one from the west

1:09:25.248 --> 1:09:27.424
and one from the east.

1:09:27.467 --> 1:09:29.861
Uniformed officers
will stage here,

1:09:29.904 --> 1:09:33.038
while K-9 and Air 2
will be on stand-by

1:09:33.081 --> 1:09:35.171
in case we have a runner.

1:09:35.214 --> 1:09:37.912
Detective Reidwill provide usthe green light

1:09:37.956 --> 1:09:40.959
as soon as the shipmentand the targets areverified on scene.

1:09:41.002 --> 1:09:43.657
If you have any questions,
please refer to your handouts.

1:09:44.658 --> 1:09:46.399
- Officer Diaz.
- Yeah.

1:09:46.443 --> 1:09:48.227
What's with the south wing?

1:09:48.271 --> 1:09:50.098
South wing is
a dead zone.

1:09:50.142 --> 1:09:52.013
Containers here
are about 40 ft. high,

1:09:52.057 --> 1:09:53.798
there's no chanceof escape.

1:09:53.841 --> 1:09:55.452
We've verified there isno contraband

1:09:55.495 --> 1:09:57.976
and those containersare not movingany time soon.

1:09:58.019 --> 1:09:59.586
Trust me, these guys
are smart.

1:09:59.630 --> 1:10:02.676
They're not gonna
get caught in this area.

1:10:02.720 --> 1:10:06.419
Got it? All right.
Let's talk tactics.

1:10:35.318 --> 1:10:36.841
Scared now, Mikey?

1:10:39.278 --> 1:10:40.801
I can explain.

1:10:47.112 --> 1:10:50.594
You turn us all in,
you save your own ass?

1:10:50.637 --> 1:10:54.119
- Is that the idea?
- You're gonna have
to trust me, okay, Ava?

1:10:54.162 --> 1:10:56.164
- It's a little late
for that.

1:10:56.208 --> 1:10:58.123
- What are you doing?
- What do you think
I'm doing?

1:10:58.166 --> 1:11:00.256
- I'm calling Charlie.
- No, no, wait a second.

1:11:00.299 --> 1:11:01.561
Wait a second.

1:11:02.997 --> 1:11:05.739
Charlie might havegiven you a second chance.

1:11:05.783 --> 1:11:07.088
But I won't.

1:11:12.877 --> 1:11:15.096
- I'm a cop.

1:11:15.140 --> 1:11:17.273
- Hello?
- Charlie.

1:11:18.317 --> 1:11:19.840
Yeah?

1:11:19.884 --> 1:11:22.147
I need to tell yousomething.

1:11:22.190 --> 1:11:25.411
- What's up?
- We're out of milk.

1:11:25.455 --> 1:11:28.284
- Uh... okay.
- Can you get some
on your way home?

1:11:30.024 --> 1:11:31.548
Sure, I guess.

1:11:34.594 --> 1:11:35.987
They forced me to do it.

1:11:36.030 --> 1:11:37.858
- You bastard.
- I didn't have a choice.

1:11:37.902 --> 1:11:39.469
There's alwaysa choice, Mikey.

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.081
I'm not gonna let
anything happen
to you or Charlie.

1:11:43.124 --> 1:11:45.518
- Okay?
- I don't believe you.

1:11:45.562 --> 1:11:49.000
Well, you're gonna
have to. All right?

1:11:49.043 --> 1:11:52.133
If any of this gets out,
then we're all fucked.

1:11:52.177 --> 1:11:53.744
Just give me
some time, please.

1:11:54.875 --> 1:11:56.224
Just a little bit
of time.

1:11:57.225 --> 1:11:58.270
I'll figure this out.

1:12:01.186 --> 1:12:03.101
You better fucking knowwhat you're doing.

1:13:03.030 --> 1:13:04.380
Fuck!

1:14:07.747 --> 1:14:09.314
What is this?

1:14:09.357 --> 1:14:11.751
That is our way out.

1:14:11.795 --> 1:14:14.928
It's a dead end.Police aren't covering it.

1:14:14.972 --> 1:14:17.322
Wait, if it's a dead end,
where's the fucking way out?

1:14:18.323 --> 1:14:20.107
That's where you come in.

1:14:20.151 --> 1:14:21.282
You're gonna goto the container yard

1:14:21.326 --> 1:14:22.849
and you're gonna talkto Gordie.

1:14:22.893 --> 1:14:24.677
- Who?
- Gordie.

1:14:24.721 --> 1:14:26.505
He's one of the loadersCharlie deals with.

1:14:26.549 --> 1:14:28.594
- Gordie!
- You'll recognize him
right away.

1:14:28.638 --> 1:14:30.596
He's kind of slow, he has these huge bifocals,

1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:32.511
- and he's always asking...
-  What's that?

1:14:32.555 --> 1:14:34.557
I need you to remove
all the contents

1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.515
from container 30994.

1:14:40.519 --> 1:14:43.043
Thank you very much!

1:14:43.087 --> 1:14:46.482
After that, you're gonna get himto empty the entire container.

1:14:46.525 --> 1:14:49.659
When he's done, you go in and you get to work.

1:14:49.702 --> 1:14:51.704
You're gonna cut every single lock on both sides.

1:14:56.492 --> 1:14:57.928
And that's it?

1:14:57.971 --> 1:14:59.712
No.

1:14:59.756 --> 1:15:00.974
Before you do
any of that,

1:15:01.018 --> 1:15:02.889
you have to go
to this address.

1:15:02.933 --> 1:15:04.891
It's a costume shop. You're gonna ask for Laszlo.

1:15:04.935 --> 1:15:07.241
He's gonna give you a uniform for Gordie.

1:15:16.076 --> 1:15:17.382
- Why me?

1:15:17.425 --> 1:15:19.036
Why aren't you
doing this?

1:15:19.079 --> 1:15:20.516
'Cause I'm workinga 12-hour day.

1:15:20.559 --> 1:15:21.995
I can't get awayfrom Sammy and Charlie,

1:15:22.039 --> 1:15:24.041
and even if I could,the cops are watching me.

1:15:24.084 --> 1:15:25.912
If I'm spotted even oncein that container yard,

1:15:25.956 --> 1:15:27.392
then it's game over.

1:15:33.398 --> 1:15:35.400
I'm only doing this
for Charlie.

1:15:36.967 --> 1:15:38.534
If he gets hurt...

1:15:46.498 --> 1:15:48.326
- Isaiah.
- Detective.

1:15:48.369 --> 1:15:50.589
See if you can get me
some background
on that suspect.

1:15:50.633 --> 1:15:51.851
Will do.
Let me find him.

1:15:51.895 --> 1:15:54.375
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:15:54.419 --> 1:15:56.987
One of Koflex's guys
was just arrested in a DUI.

1:15:57.030 --> 1:15:59.859
- That's good for us, right?
- No.

1:15:59.903 --> 1:16:03.123
We've got a problem.
They found these
in his car.

1:16:08.651 --> 1:16:10.609
- Damn!
- I know.

1:16:16.136 --> 1:16:18.356
All right. Take it.

1:16:21.315 --> 1:16:23.535
That's it, boys
That's the last of it.

1:16:23.579 --> 1:16:25.842
-  What now?

1:16:25.885 --> 1:16:28.496
Now? Now we get paid.

1:16:28.540 --> 1:16:30.324
Let me call Koflex,
tell him we're on our way.

1:16:32.413 --> 1:16:34.285
Koflex? Sammy here.

1:16:34.328 --> 1:16:35.982
We're all done.

1:16:36.026 --> 1:16:37.941
When do you want to meet us
at the container yards?

1:16:39.464 --> 1:16:41.118
There's still
lots of time, Sammy.

1:16:42.467 --> 1:16:44.164
Let's meet
at the club first.

1:16:46.645 --> 1:16:49.256
- The club?
- Yeah.

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:50.475
Oh, and Sammy?

1:16:51.824 --> 1:16:54.000
Bring the entire
crew as well.

1:16:55.393 --> 1:16:57.308
Ahem. All right.

1:17:01.181 --> 1:17:02.879
So what did he say?

1:17:05.490 --> 1:17:07.710
He wants to meet us
at the club.

1:17:07.753 --> 1:17:10.669
- At the club?
- It's fun. It's fine.

1:17:25.423 --> 1:17:27.860
How comeyou're not dancing?

1:17:27.904 --> 1:17:30.384
I don't feel
like it, Charlie.

1:17:30.428 --> 1:17:32.299
What the fuck are we
even doing here?

1:17:32.343 --> 1:17:35.825
That's a good question!

1:17:35.868 --> 1:17:37.522
What are we doing
here, Sammy?

1:17:42.527 --> 1:17:44.529
There's nothing
to worry about.

1:17:47.532 --> 1:17:51.144
He's a businessman.
I'm sure he's got
a reason.

1:17:58.978 --> 1:18:00.153
I gotta go
to the washroom.

1:18:01.720 --> 1:18:02.939
I'll be back.

1:18:09.075 --> 1:18:13.253
Come on... Come on...
Damn it, where are you?

1:18:20.565 --> 1:18:22.654
- What?
- Mikey!

1:18:22.698 --> 1:18:25.875
Where the hell have you been?
I've been trying to reach you.

1:18:25.918 --> 1:18:27.746
We're at the club.
Koflex wants to meet us here.

1:18:27.790 --> 1:18:29.095
What the hell
is going on?

1:18:29.139 --> 1:18:30.662
Mikey, get the fuck
out of there.

1:18:30.706 --> 1:18:32.882
I can't, everyone's here.
What--

1:18:32.925 --> 1:18:35.667
- What about the shipment?
- Forget about the shipment.

1:18:35.711 --> 1:18:37.756
Koflex knows.

1:18:37.800 --> 1:18:39.627
What?

1:18:39.671 --> 1:18:41.978
Koflex knows
that you're an agent.
Get out of there.

1:18:42.021 --> 1:18:43.196
Now!

1:18:55.295 --> 1:18:57.123
You shouldn't drinkso much, bro.

1:18:58.342 --> 1:18:59.647
You gotta paceyourself.

1:19:00.910 --> 1:19:03.477
That-- that'sfucking gross, man.

1:19:12.748 --> 1:19:14.401
Hey! Hey, hey, hey,
buddy, hey!

1:19:14.445 --> 1:19:16.055
Uh, look-- Look,
there's been
a change of plans.

1:19:16.099 --> 1:19:18.231
-  What plans?
- What-- what plan?

1:19:18.275 --> 1:19:20.059
The plan that we
talked about.

1:19:20.103 --> 1:19:22.366
- Huh?
- Okay, listen to me.

1:19:22.409 --> 1:19:24.150
I need you to write
down this address, okay?

1:19:24.194 --> 1:19:26.544
87 Darcy Street.

1:19:26.587 --> 1:19:28.198
Okay.

1:19:29.199 --> 1:19:30.330
Back home,

1:19:31.331 --> 1:19:32.680
when I was in the war...

1:19:34.160 --> 1:19:35.988
I had a commander.

1:19:37.424 --> 1:19:39.122
He loved Shakespeare.

1:19:41.385 --> 1:19:43.387
Julius Caesarwas his favorite.

1:19:47.826 --> 1:19:50.089
"For let the gods
so speed me

1:19:50.133 --> 1:19:53.266
as I lovethe name of honor

1:19:53.310 --> 1:19:56.356
- more than I fear death."
- Cheers!

1:20:00.665 --> 1:20:04.408
Samuel, do you rememberwhen we met in Ghana?

1:20:04.451 --> 1:20:06.497
What I told youwhen you askedto work with me?

1:20:10.849 --> 1:20:12.155
Ah, Mikey, Mikey.

1:20:12.198 --> 1:20:14.505
Perfect timing.

1:20:14.548 --> 1:20:18.117
Sit down. You don't want
to miss this story.

1:20:19.858 --> 1:20:22.121
I was just telling your friendsthe first time I met Sammy.

1:20:23.862 --> 1:20:25.429
So...

1:20:25.472 --> 1:20:27.170
Do you rememberwhat I told you?

1:20:27.213 --> 1:20:29.955
No.

1:20:31.914 --> 1:20:34.003
You're kind
of freaking me out, man.

1:20:37.963 --> 1:20:40.270
Ah, there's no reason
to be freaked out now.

1:20:40.313 --> 1:20:43.664
Come on! I'm
just fucking with you.

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:46.363
We're here to celebrate,are we not?

1:20:51.150 --> 1:20:52.151
To Sammy.

1:20:54.284 --> 1:20:55.807
- May you rot in hell.

1:20:57.069 --> 1:20:58.810
- What the fuck?!

1:21:01.334 --> 1:21:03.162
- I know you're working
with the police.

1:21:03.206 --> 1:21:04.729
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1:21:04.772 --> 1:21:06.774
We caught Mikeyand your whore of a girlfriend

1:21:06.818 --> 1:21:08.907
- outside the police station.
- No, no, no, no, no!

1:21:08.951 --> 1:21:10.866
No, Charlie had nothingto do with it, all right?It was just me.

1:21:10.909 --> 1:21:12.041
Charlie, it's not
what you think.

1:21:12.084 --> 1:21:13.172
He was trying to save you.

1:21:15.871 --> 1:21:17.002
SWAT!

1:22:02.047 --> 1:22:03.788
Drop it!

1:22:22.894 --> 1:22:26.115
Michael Braley.
Identify yourself.

1:22:27.116 --> 1:22:28.378
I'm here.

1:22:34.645 --> 1:22:36.342
I'm here.

1:22:37.996 --> 1:22:39.345
I'm here!

1:23:03.717 --> 1:23:05.719
Folks, this way,
please.

1:23:05.763 --> 1:23:07.112
Keep it moving.

1:23:22.736 --> 1:23:24.477
Fuck!

1:23:39.927 --> 1:23:42.495
You think this is
a fucking joke?

1:23:42.539 --> 1:23:44.802
- What?
- Where the hell
is he, Mikey?

1:23:44.845 --> 1:23:48.110
- Who?
- Your pal, Charlie.

1:23:48.153 --> 1:23:51.243
We know that you were
trying to help him
escape.

1:23:51.287 --> 1:23:54.072
Wow.

1:23:54.116 --> 1:23:57.858
- He escaped?
- Yeah. He escaped.

1:23:57.902 --> 1:24:00.209
Where'd he go?

1:24:00.252 --> 1:24:02.254
- You fucking...
-  Jesus Christ,
Jennie!

1:24:06.780 --> 1:24:08.652
I was reaching
for the stars.

1:24:09.653 --> 1:24:12.003
What the fuck happened?

1:24:14.527 --> 1:24:17.226
I really thoughthe was gonna save us.

1:24:18.488 --> 1:24:19.967
Us?

1:24:23.232 --> 1:24:25.277
Come on,
Mikey.

1:24:25.321 --> 1:24:27.584
We know you snuck back
into the yard,

1:24:27.627 --> 1:24:30.108
we know you had plans
to help Charlie.

1:24:30.152 --> 1:24:32.763
Just tell us
where they went.

1:24:32.806 --> 1:24:35.113
We also knowabout your lover, Ava,

1:24:35.157 --> 1:24:37.898
cutting locks
in the container.

1:24:37.942 --> 1:24:40.597
So stop fucking around
and tell us
where they went!

1:24:40.640 --> 1:24:42.164
What the fuckdo you want from me?

1:24:42.207 --> 1:24:43.817
Huh? I almostdied today.

1:24:45.515 --> 1:24:48.909
And how the helldid Koflex knowthat I was an agent, huh?

1:24:48.953 --> 1:24:50.781
And if I had died,

1:24:50.824 --> 1:24:52.870
who'd have beenresponsible? You?

1:24:52.913 --> 1:24:54.176
You?

1:24:56.308 --> 1:24:59.268
Who cares about the punkcar thief as longas we get what we want, huh?

1:25:01.226 --> 1:25:02.793
Shit!

1:25:16.720 --> 1:25:18.722
Finally! We're
freezing back here!

1:25:18.765 --> 1:25:20.724
Officer, you think
we could get some heat?

1:25:22.682 --> 1:25:24.815
Yo!
Turn on the heat!

1:25:24.858 --> 1:25:26.773
What's that?

1:25:26.817 --> 1:25:29.385
- Gordie?!
- Buckle up, Charlie!

1:25:29.428 --> 1:25:32.344
- Fuck. Okay.

1:25:50.406 --> 1:25:53.626
- Mikey?
- What?

1:25:54.714 --> 1:25:56.455
Don't leave town.

1:25:59.023 --> 1:26:00.285
I won't.

1:26:38.628 --> 1:26:40.847
You know we're gonna have
to start all over, right?

1:26:49.508 --> 1:26:51.293
Where are we going?

1:26:54.339 --> 1:26:56.515
Why don't you ask
the captain?

1:27:16.883 --> 1:27:19.756
So where are we
going, Mikey?

1:27:19.799 --> 1:27:21.758
It's a surprise.

1:27:21.801 --> 1:27:23.890
Somewhere warm,
I hope.

1:27:25.805 --> 1:27:27.198
You ever seen Bad Boys?

1:27:30.114 --> 1:27:31.246
One or two?
