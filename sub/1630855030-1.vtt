15:45.980 --> 15:48.890
You told me that he was

close.

on the trigger,

controlling that finger.

16:23.670 --> 16:26.620
This is Adrian Delorio,
the fixer'’s fixer.

16:26.820 --> 16:29.190
He can smuggle
the Obamas into China

16:29.390 --> 16:33.020
and an entire cartel
into Texas completely unnoticed.

16:33.220 --> 16:36.460
This is Adrian'’s crypto guy,

something.

into the brain stem.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.670
[Alexa] So what happened
to Sebastian?

17:50.280 --> 17:52.310
What happens when
it gets pulled out like that?

17:52.510 --> 17:56.240
It'’s like a file transfer
that crashes mid-download.
Gets corrupted.

17:57.460 --> 17:58.670
So will he ever wake up?

17:58.870 --> 18:02.160
If you can get
that spider back, yes.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.290
The brain is just
an electrical system,
and any system can be hacked.

18:43.770 --> 18:44.810
Sorry.

18:49.990 --> 18:52.000
That is your drone.

18:52.780 --> 18:54.650
And this is your target.

18:59.130 --> 19:00.310
How do I come home?

19:01.000 --> 19:02.860
You close your eyes.

19:03.060 --> 19:05.080
You feel yourself,
your real self.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.260
It'’s been there all along.

19:07.460 --> 19:09.840

49:34.490 --> 49:36.580
when it got like this?

49:42.370 --> 49:43.370
Sebastian?

49:50.290 --> 49:52.200
He would go home to you.

49:54.200 --> 49:55.450
[boss] It'’s time to go.

49:55.650 --> 49:57.210
You got two hours
to come home,

49:58.030 --> 49:59.430
or I'’ll pull the fucking plug.

50:18.180 --> 50:20.220
[line ringing]

50:20.420 --> 50:22.520
[Mali]
<i>Hey, you'’ve reached Mali.</i>

50:22.720 --> 50:25.020
<i>Leave a message.[beeps]</i>

50:53.130 --> 50:54.130
[gun clicks]

51:01.400 --> 51:03.400
[gasps, panting]

51:08.150 --> 51:10.320
Let'’s go for a drive.

51:14.760 --> 51:17.460
[sighs][phone vibrating]

51:27.210 --> 51:28.560
[scoffs]

51:31.130 --> 51:32.420
[phone beeps]

51:32.620 --> 51:33.590
[Mr. Bubblegum] <i>Hello.</i>

51:33.790 --> 51:36.990
Hey, did we party
last night?

51:37.190 --> 51:39.610
<i>No. You said you</i>
<i>were staying in.</i>

51:41.270 --> 51:42.920
Well, I don'’t
remember anything.

52:14.040 --> 52:15.720
[Alexa] <i>Where are you right now?</i>

52:15.920 --> 52:17.740
[Sebastian] <i>I don'’t know.</i>

52:20.650 --> 52:21.960
[Alexa] <i>Come back to me.</i>

52:24.700 --> 52:26.180
[Sebastian]
<i>What if I don'’t know how?</i>

52:28.970 --> 52:30.710
[Alexa] <i>Then I'’ll</i>
<i>have to come find you.</i>

52:40.720 --> 52:41.710
What can I get you?

52:41.910 --> 52:44.490
Grilled cheese with tomato.

52:44.690 --> 52:47.800
Do you know what
they call that?A happy waitress?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.540
[chuckles] A happy waitress.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.080
And for the lady?

52:51.860 --> 52:52.860
I'’m not hungry.

52:54.170 --> 52:56.600
Your husband
always ordered lobster.

52:57.390 --> 52:59.110
At the diner.

52:59.310 --> 53:00.480
Like an amateur.

53:03.610 --> 53:07.040
He wasn'’t an amateur.
You just didn'’t know him.

53:07.240 --> 53:09.520
I spent months in
the safe house with him.

53:09.720 --> 53:11.840
Oh, yeah?
So why did he order
lobster then?

53:15.970 --> 53:17.520
We were in Baghdad.

53:17.720 --> 53:21.400
We got pinned down in
this bombed-out apartment,

53:21.600 --> 53:25.070
and I was shaking in
my boots, and he was calm,
talking about...

53:26.020 --> 53:27.660
[sighs]

53:27.860 --> 53:30.200
..."If we had to go out
to dinner tonight...

53:32.600 --> 53:35.210
where would you wanna go?
What would you wanna eat?"

53:37.470 --> 53:38.780
And I just said,
"Lobster."

53:41.000 --> 53:42.130
And that was it.

53:43.560 --> 53:45.990
For the rest of our
lives, he was always,

53:46.190 --> 53:49.660
"Someday, I'’m gonna
take you out for lobster."

53:50.700 --> 53:51.750
Why someday?

53:54.050 --> 53:56.530
Because he was allergic
to shellfish.

53:57.660 --> 54:00.230
Said he had to work up
tolerance.Amateur.

54:01.280 --> 54:03.100
And he always
fights for me.

54:04.500 --> 54:05.760
For us.

54:07.670 --> 54:09.500
And that'’s why
this is really hard,

54:11.290 --> 54:13.160
because I just
feel like he'’s...

54:16.860 --> 54:18.160
gone.

54:19.560 --> 54:20.900
Keep that connection.

54:21.820 --> 54:23.340
These other bodies,

54:24.260 --> 54:25.740
these other lives,

54:27.170 --> 54:28.250
it'’s just noise.

54:28.450 --> 54:29.960
Tune it out.

54:31.090 --> 54:32.180
You'’ll make it.

54:36.920 --> 54:38.660
Need the bathroom.

54:46.450 --> 54:48.760
A happy waitress, sunshine.

54:54.980 --> 54:56.200
[sighs]

55:01.820 --> 55:04.640
[agent] Hey, I'’ve been
looking all over for you.

55:06.470 --> 55:10.420
Grilled cheese and tomato.
A happy waitress.

55:10.620 --> 55:14.000
I'’m happy, Mr. Valmora.
Are you happy too?

55:16.180 --> 55:17.910
[sighs]

55:18.110 --> 55:21.530
[agent]
You enjoying the weather?
Get any bug bites lately?

55:27.840 --> 55:30.000
It'’s so nice
to see you again.

55:30.200 --> 55:33.460
You'’re dead,
you son of a bitch.Only if you find me first.

55:34.980 --> 55:36.150
[patrons gasp, scream]

55:44.160 --> 55:45.900
Adrian got him.

55:47.600 --> 55:48.810
Got me too.

55:49.010 --> 55:52.780
He'’s gonna use me now
to kill you.

55:56.300 --> 55:57.520
You finish this.

56:02.180 --> 56:05.400
I can already feel him
in my head.

56:07.660 --> 56:08.750
Come on!

56:09.840 --> 56:11.360
You'’ve always wanted this.

56:27.160 --> 56:28.600
I'’d do it.

56:40.300 --> 56:42.050
[gasps]

57:06.850 --> 57:08.250
[gasps]

57:11.070 --> 57:12.900
How do I know you'’re you?

57:14.430 --> 57:16.070
You don'’t.

57:16.270 --> 57:19.430
Well, they'’re both dead,
and I'’m going home.

57:20.610 --> 57:23.770
You go home,
Adrian wins.

57:23.970 --> 57:26.510
Someone, some day,
is gonna put a knife
in your throat,

57:26.710 --> 57:28.660
and you'’re never
gonna see him coming.

57:34.790 --> 57:36.750
[screams]

59:12.890 --> 59:15.110
[gasping][switch clicks]

59:19.040 --> 59:22.240
[panting, cries]

59:22.440 --> 59:27.520
Alexa, tomorrow, you see Adrian.
Tomorrow, you finish this.

59:29.470 --> 59:30.610
Okay.

59:33.700 --> 59:35.700
[panting]

1:00:49.900 --> 1:00:51.640
Come back to me.

1:00:55.170 --> 1:00:56.210
Please.

1:01:11.050 --> 1:01:13.400
I'’m gonna do something
really hard now,

1:01:14.400 --> 1:01:15.840
but...

1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:21.590
I need you to hold me.

1:01:52.400 --> 1:01:53.750
Who are you?

1:01:54.880 --> 1:01:56.580
I'’m--Get out!

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:18.280
Oh, Hi, Mali.
Was he expecting you?

1:02:18.480 --> 1:02:21.080
[grunts, coughing]

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:53.550
[water lapping]

1:03:13.480 --> 1:03:14.660
What are you doing here?

1:03:19.490 --> 1:03:20.700
I wanted to see you.

1:03:24.490 --> 1:03:25.710
It'’s not a good time.

1:03:28.630 --> 1:03:31.240
What happened?Leave me alone!

1:03:45.210 --> 1:03:49.340
What if I don'’t
wanna leave you alone?

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.050
Look, talk to me.

1:04:05.840 --> 1:04:08.140
Just tell me
where you are.

1:04:11.490 --> 1:04:13.760
I ran into an old friend.

1:04:15.020 --> 1:04:16.150
Didn'’t go so well.

1:04:20.420 --> 1:04:21.640
Me too.

1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:28.560
What do you need right now?

1:04:33.870 --> 1:04:36.040
If you want me to leave,
I can leave,

1:04:36.870 --> 1:04:39.870
but I was hoping I could stay.

1:05:01.110 --> 1:05:04.900
Sometimes, the only thing
that makes sense...

1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:13.030
the only thing that
makes me feel like me

1:05:14.690 --> 1:05:17.730
is... touch.

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:05.910

What happened?I don'’t remember.

1:08:22.400 --> 1:08:25.170
Why am I here?I pulled you out
when you lost consciousness.

1:08:25.370 --> 1:08:26.950
Here.I don'’t need this.

1:08:27.150 --> 1:08:28.870
You should change
out of your wet suit.

1:08:29.070 --> 1:08:30.540
What are you talking about?

1:08:31.890 --> 1:08:33.150
What the fuck?

I didn'’t wanna get
you undressed.Who am I right now?

What happened in there?
Just tell me and we'’ll fix it.

1:08:57.450 --> 1:08:58.770
You can'’t fix it!

1:08:58.970 --> 1:09:01.730
I can try.
Just come back.

Fuck.What the fuck happened in there?

1:09:52.460 --> 1:09:54.870
I found the tech.
I found Sebastian'’s spider!

as Adrian,
chasing another woman!

1:17:54.070 --> 1:17:56.780
I was grooming her for you,
so she could be your host!

So we could take
the tech and disappear!I don'’t want that.

1:18:00.070 --> 1:18:01.960
Nobody could come
looking for us.

you wanna be.

1:18:18.040 --> 1:18:19.210
That'’s the whole point.

1:18:21.130 --> 1:18:22.650
[door opens]

1:18:23.430 --> 1:18:24.940
No, no. No!

1:18:25.140 --> 1:18:27.250
Hey! Hey, hey, hey. No!

1:18:27.450 --> 1:18:29.160
They used me.[Alexa] Don'’t do this.

1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:30.860
I did all the dirty work...Don'’t do this!

1:18:31.060 --> 1:18:33.260
...and they got to
walk away clean!Don'’t do this!

1:18:33.460 --> 1:18:35.650
Hey!So we'’re gonna walk away clean,

1:18:35.850 --> 1:18:37.260
and you'’re gonna be the one
that'’s gonna suffer.

1:18:37.460 --> 1:18:39.570
Please, don'’t do this!
Don'’t do this, please!

1:18:39.770 --> 1:18:41.000
Sebastian!Sebastian is gone!

1:18:41.200 --> 1:18:43.800
[gunshot][casing clatters on floor]

1:18:47.500 --> 1:18:50.290
[no audio]

1:19:25.230 --> 1:19:28.350
[Sebastian]
<i>"I promise you, I'’ll never die,</i>

1:19:28.550 --> 1:19:30.330
<i>unless I'’m looking</i>
<i>in your eyes."</i>

1:19:52.480 --> 1:19:53.830
Been months.

1:19:56.530 --> 1:19:57.880
How are you holding up?

1:20:02.310 --> 1:20:03.450
I, uh...

1:20:05.060 --> 1:20:07.840
I don'’t know.
I'’m-- I'’m fine.

1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:11.270
It'’s normal to have feelings.

1:20:11.470 --> 1:20:17.020
You were her and now you'’re--
you'’re just you again.

1:20:18.900 --> 1:20:22.320
Anyway, you hadn'’t
checked in, so I--

1:20:22.520 --> 1:20:24.290
I just wanted to make
sure you were okay.

1:20:27.770 --> 1:20:29.040
I'’m okay.

1:20:34.560 --> 1:20:36.090
She'’s gone missing.

1:20:37.040 --> 1:20:38.520
You haven'’t seen her,
have you?

1:20:42.530 --> 1:20:43.570
No.

1:20:45.840 --> 1:20:47.100
Not a sight.

1:20:59.330 --> 1:21:00.980
[cooing, giggling]

1:21:05.030 --> 1:21:06.060
You hungry?

1:21:06.260 --> 1:21:08.500
Hello, we all good in here?

1:21:08.700 --> 1:21:10.330
I am drowning in here.

1:21:10.530 --> 1:21:11.890
Can you take over?

1:21:12.090 --> 1:21:12.980
Of course.

1:21:13.180 --> 1:21:17.220
No, I mean take over.

1:21:18.260 --> 1:21:19.390
I got you.

1:21:36.230 --> 1:21:37.710
[breathes deeply]

1:21:41.850 --> 1:21:43.280
[exhales]

1:21:47.030 --> 1:21:48.900
[sighs]

1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:55.690
[inhales sharply]

1:21:56.820 --> 1:21:58.300
[baby cooing]

1:22:16.140 --> 1:22:18.320
You have a beautiful family.

1:22:22.930 --> 1:22:23.930
Me.

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:32.510
Your auntie.

1:22:37.250 --> 1:22:42.040
And one day,
I'’ll tell you all about...

1:22:49.570 --> 1:22:51.140
your father.
