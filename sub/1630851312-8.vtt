09:57.727 --> 09:59.860
See,
what-what ha-happened was...

10:00.034 --> 10:01.644
Well, you know,
it was a mix-up.

10:01.818 --> 10:03.472
[chuckles]
Well, it's...

10:03.646 --> 10:05.213
It's pretty,
though, huh? Right.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.737
Tina, this is a pretty
damn expensive mistake.

10:07.868 --> 10:10.697
You know what?
I hate to do this.

10:10.871 --> 10:14.135
I might regret doing this,
but I got to do this.

10:14.265 --> 10:15.397
You're fired.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.409
[jazz music playing][Tina scatting along]

10:29.977 --> 10:32.022
[groans]

10:33.720 --> 10:35.025
Oh.

10:35.199 --> 10:37.245
Oh, well,
look who finally made it home.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.856
Not funny, Ella.

10:40.030 --> 10:41.031
[music turns off]

10:41.205 --> 10:42.772
You know I had to take the bus.

10:42.903 --> 10:44.861
Next time
you fire your wife,

10:45.035 --> 10:46.733
be sure you drive.

10:49.083 --> 10:51.781
Know what?
Tina, that was business.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.914
It wasn't personal. Uh...

10:54.088 --> 10:57.265
Hold up. Is that my
18-year-old single malt Scotch

10:57.439 --> 10:58.919
that I've been saving

10:59.093 --> 11:00.181
for when the Clippers
win the championship?

11:00.311 --> 11:02.096
Oh, it is.

11:02.270 --> 11:03.706
And it's totally personal.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.666
[chuckles]

11:06.796 --> 11:08.493
Oh, that's cold-blooded, Tina.

11:08.668 --> 11:11.496
I-I... What is that
I smell burning?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.673
Oh, it's just your last

11:13.847 --> 11:16.023
overpriced Cuban cigar.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.155
You know, I don't know
why you like these things.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.809
It smells horrible.[sputters]

11:21.071 --> 11:23.639
Have you lost your damn mind?

11:23.770 --> 11:26.555
No. Just my damn job.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.210
[knock on door]

11:30.472 --> 11:32.692
How can I help you?Oh, hey, guys.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.955
We still on for Yahtzee?Um,

11:35.129 --> 11:37.522
is everything okay?Everything is fine.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.655
Oh! I got fired today.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.571
Wait, what?
Calvin, how could you?

11:42.745 --> 11:43.746
Your own wife?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.400
Oh, Dave!

11:45.574 --> 11:47.881
Welcome to Team Tina.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.405
Wait, Tina, what happened?No, go ahead.
Go ahead, Tina.

11:50.579 --> 11:51.928
Tell 'em the whole story.

11:52.102 --> 11:53.756
How you made a
gang of mistakes.

11:53.930 --> 11:56.541
First, she didn't
pay the light bill.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.066
She ordered the wrong
parts for certain cars.

11:59.196 --> 12:02.678
And then she put in that
perfumy soap that I hate

12:02.809 --> 12:04.811
in the bathroom. Smell it.Oh.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.856
No, thank you. I already
smelled it when I walked in.

12:08.640 --> 12:11.600
And, by the way, I washed
your drawers in it, too.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.299
To be fair, you did say

12:15.430 --> 12:17.824
Tina-licious Cakes
was taking up all of your time.

12:17.998 --> 12:21.088
The devil doesn't need
any advocates, Gemma.

12:21.218 --> 12:24.091
I'm just saying, Calvin
does have a business to run.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.701
TINA:
Oh.Exactly.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.747
Okay, hold on, Gemma. So, if you

12:27.877 --> 12:29.183
hired me to mediate
at your school

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
and I made amistake...

12:31.576 --> 12:32.752
A gang of mistakes.DAVE:
Okay.

12:33.796 --> 12:35.885
You would fire
me on the spot?

12:36.016 --> 12:36.886
Hell yeah.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.409
[grunts]Wow.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.107
Who are you?

12:42.239 --> 12:45.373
Welcome to Team Calvin,
all right? [chuckles][chuckles]

12:45.547 --> 12:48.245
Well, thanks to one of you
for stopping by.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.943
And I was talking about Dave.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.990
Yeah, I-I got it.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.949
You know what? I need a drink.
Give me this, Dave.What?

12:56.123 --> 12:57.559
Yeah.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.518
Mm. Mm! What the hell?

13:00.649 --> 13:01.998
You know, it was too Scotch-y,

13:02.172 --> 13:04.914
so I added Mountain Dew
to the bottle.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.965
[whoops][chuckles] Yo, that was
our best practice yet.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.489
But I still didn't hit the ball.Yeah,

13:14.663 --> 13:16.447
but you know what?
Every time you swung,

13:16.621 --> 13:18.798
you stayed on your feet.

13:18.928 --> 13:21.583
Oh, my God,
I'm gonna go tell Mom.

13:21.757 --> 13:22.976
I'm an athlete!

13:23.150 --> 13:25.021
Yeah.

13:26.283 --> 13:28.372
Team is looking pretty good.
We should celebrate.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.505
Yeah. Well,
looks like we got some...

13:30.679 --> 13:32.594
hard seltzer
and some vegan jerky.

13:32.724 --> 13:35.292
Ooh, yes and, uh, yes again.

13:35.466 --> 13:39.862
Well, Ariel brought this
nasty stuff over, but, uh...

13:40.036 --> 13:42.430
I guess one man's trash
is another man's trash.[chuckles]

13:42.604 --> 13:45.607
Hey, how's it going with her?
And you better say great,

13:45.737 --> 13:47.696
because her kid
is the key to us winning.

13:47.870 --> 13:49.872
Well, to be honest, fellas,
Ariel and I

13:50.046 --> 13:53.702
have a ton of physical chemistry
but, uh, not much else.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.225
I think I might have
to break up with her.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.097
N-No, no.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.447
Uh...

13:59.621 --> 14:01.014
Malcolm, y-you need
to make that work.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.842
At least until playoffs.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.236
Uh, Dave, that
is months away.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.760
I-I'm not sure this relationship
is gonna last that long.Well, look,

14:08.935 --> 14:10.110
you're gonna have
to suck it up,

14:10.284 --> 14:12.939
because if you
break up with her,

14:13.113 --> 14:14.331
she is gonna pull her son
from the team,

14:14.505 --> 14:17.291
and, Malcolm,
Grover needs a win.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.250
Whoa, Dave,

14:20.424 --> 14:21.686
it sounds like youneed a win.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.037
Well, can't it be both?

14:25.299 --> 14:28.389
Okay, man, I...
I guess I can make it work.

14:28.519 --> 14:30.260
What?

14:30.434 --> 14:32.959
Malcolm, you're not seriously
considering using a woman

14:33.133 --> 14:35.309
so that a youth baseball team
can win a trophy?

14:35.483 --> 14:38.268
Okay. You know, look,
I'm just trying to save Grover

14:38.442 --> 14:39.704
from a lifetime of therapy.

14:39.879 --> 14:43.621
And "using"
is such an ugly word.

14:43.752 --> 14:45.319
Okay. Well, as someone

14:45.493 --> 14:46.276
who has been to therapy...
Mind your business.

14:48.148 --> 14:49.889
I got some other words
for what's happening here.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.455
How about manipulating?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.283
Deceiving?

14:53.457 --> 14:54.763
Exploiting!

14:54.937 --> 14:56.069
All right.
You know what, Marty?

14:56.243 --> 14:57.331
I've got a couple words
for you, too.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.462
How about "stay out of it"?!

15:02.075 --> 15:04.860
All right. Let's see
what you got next.Okay.

15:04.991 --> 15:07.167
Mm, mm. Mmm.

15:07.341 --> 15:09.082
Okay.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.953
Mm-hmm.Mm-hmm?

15:11.127 --> 15:12.955
Chocolate-covered strawberries.[laughs]

15:14.000 --> 15:15.827
Wow.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.786
You are killing this
blindfold fruit challenge.[chuckles]

15:17.960 --> 15:20.180
Mmm.Now let's see

15:20.354 --> 15:22.225
if you know what this is.Okay.

15:24.401 --> 15:27.317
Mmm. Mmm, yeah, that-that...
That tastes like round two.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.319
[laughs]Yeah. Uh...

15:29.493 --> 15:31.321
Maybe this time

15:31.495 --> 15:32.714
we can take it to the bedroom.Oh.

15:32.844 --> 15:33.976
I like that.
[chuckles][chuckles]

15:34.150 --> 15:36.587
Aah.Oh. Uh, let me
get those for you.

15:36.761 --> 15:38.111
Yeah.
[chuckles][chuckles]

15:38.285 --> 15:39.939
You know, I got to say,

15:40.113 --> 15:41.505
this is a lot more fun

15:41.636 --> 15:43.594
than the last time
I was in handcuffs.

15:43.768 --> 15:46.293
I thought you said
this was your first time.

15:46.423 --> 15:47.947
Oh.
[chuckles]

15:48.121 --> 15:50.775
Yeah, I, uh,
got arrested at a protest.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.734
Oh.[chuckles]:
Yeah.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.562
I've been to one of those.
[chuckles]

15:54.736 --> 15:56.738
Wait. Oh, really?
Which one did you go to?Mm-hmm.

15:56.868 --> 16:01.134
W-Was it BLM, climate change
or, uh, universal health care?

16:02.135 --> 16:03.614
I can't remember,

16:03.788 --> 16:05.573
but it was lit!

16:05.747 --> 16:07.749
[laughs]I mean,

16:07.879 --> 16:09.577
I get the best pictures

16:09.751 --> 16:12.145
just walking through
the tear gas.

16:13.755 --> 16:16.323
It's like the police gave us
the perfect filter. [chuckles]

16:16.453 --> 16:18.542
I even got 5,000
more followers

16:18.716 --> 16:20.196
after that photo shoot.

16:21.415 --> 16:22.851
Do you mean "protest"?

16:23.025 --> 16:24.984
Yeah, sure. Whatever.
[scoffs]

16:27.334 --> 16:29.162
Uh...
[chuckles]

16:29.336 --> 16:31.816
Damn it,
I can't do this no more.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.644
[chuckles]
Relax, honey.

16:33.818 --> 16:35.995
I found the key.

16:36.169 --> 16:37.997
No. No. Ariel, I'm...

16:38.171 --> 16:39.824
I'm talking about us.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.391
I, uh...

16:41.565 --> 16:43.350
Look, I appreciate you
in so many ways.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.006
[chuckles]:
You know? I mean, so many ways.[chuckles]

16:47.136 --> 16:49.182
In ways I didn't even think
was possible.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.618
Oh. [laughs][laughs]:
You know? 'Cause we...

16:50.792 --> 16:53.925
And... Damn it. We...

16:54.100 --> 16:56.580
[sighs] We just don't have
enough in common.

16:56.754 --> 16:58.365
You know?

16:58.495 --> 17:00.019
I mean, I'm much more
of a private person,

17:00.149 --> 17:03.022
and you... you live your life
on social media.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.024
We just...

17:05.198 --> 17:07.548
We on a different vibe.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.638
To be honest...

17:10.812 --> 17:13.119
[sighs]
I feel the same way.

17:13.293 --> 17:16.687
It's just that you're
so great with Eli,

17:16.861 --> 17:19.168
and I didn't want
to ruin it for him.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.865
Wait, seriously?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.867
You know, I was worried
that if we broke up,

17:23.042 --> 17:24.434
you would pull him off the team.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.045
No way.

17:26.219 --> 17:29.439
You and baseball
have been so amazing for him.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.877
I was only hanging in there
because I thought you'd cut him.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.838
Well, looks like we finally
found something in common.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.057
[chuckles]

17:39.536 --> 17:40.407
Friends?

17:40.537 --> 17:41.843
Oh.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.063
Friends.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.113
Tina? What are
you doing here?

17:51.287 --> 17:53.072
[sighs] All right,
Calvin, you were right.

17:53.246 --> 17:55.291
I couldn't handle both jobs.

17:55.465 --> 17:57.250
I just didn't want to admit it.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.643
So, I'm-a give up
Tina-licious Cakes

17:59.774 --> 18:01.123
and come back to the shop.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.212
And I promise to be
fully committed this time.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.127
Wait.

18:05.301 --> 18:08.130
You gonna give up after all
that you put into your business?

18:08.304 --> 18:11.090
Well, when it was
just you and the boys,

18:11.220 --> 18:12.787
baking brought me
so much happiness,

18:12.961 --> 18:15.659
but with Tina-licious Cakes,
there's just too much pressure.

18:15.833 --> 18:17.444
Hmm.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.794
So, you just punking out?

18:19.968 --> 18:21.448
Who you calling a punk?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.060
Don't make me
go Compton up in here.

18:26.975 --> 18:29.543
Come on, Tina. Just admit that
you're afraid you're gonna fail.

18:29.717 --> 18:31.327
I'm not afraid of anything.

18:31.501 --> 18:34.896
It's just terrifying
to think about that.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.811
[exhales]
Look,

18:36.985 --> 18:40.771
Calvin, 50% of new businesses
fail after five years.

18:40.945 --> 18:42.164
That's true.

18:42.338 --> 18:44.340
But you helped
launch this one,

18:44.514 --> 18:46.342
and look at us now.

18:46.516 --> 18:48.736
With your smarts
and talent,

18:48.910 --> 18:51.130
any business
that you focus on

18:51.260 --> 18:53.784
and put your all into
is gonna be great.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.177
You really think so?

18:55.351 --> 18:56.874
I know so.

18:58.615 --> 19:00.487
You know what? I'll
hire a shop manager.

19:00.617 --> 19:04.143
And you just keep focusing
on building your empire.

19:04.317 --> 19:06.057
And soon, one day,

19:06.232 --> 19:08.147
you can buy yourself
that damn Birkin bag.

19:08.321 --> 19:10.018
[exhales][scoffs]

19:10.192 --> 19:11.498
Lord knows I'm
not buying it.[laughs]

19:11.628 --> 19:13.239
[chuckles]Stop.

19:13.413 --> 19:14.457
I mean, you can
get me a new bottle

19:14.588 --> 19:15.850
of Scotch, though.Oh, I'm not buying.

19:16.024 --> 19:18.157
[Tina and Calvin chuckle]Oh, my God.

19:18.287 --> 19:20.159
What have you
done to my car?Uh,

19:20.289 --> 19:21.856
look, ma'am, I'm sorry.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.336
I didn't get a chance
to call you,

19:23.510 --> 19:26.382
but this is our mistake,
and we'll take care of it.

19:26.556 --> 19:27.818
A mistake?

19:27.992 --> 19:30.430
It's like you put wheels
on a rainbow!

19:30.604 --> 19:32.736
So, you like it?

19:32.867 --> 19:35.435
Wouldn't you want
to drive a rainbow?

19:35.609 --> 19:38.351
Okay. Uh, well, my pleasure.

19:38.525 --> 19:39.917
Yeah.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.833
I hate to say this.

19:43.007 --> 19:44.835
I might regret saying this.

19:46.359 --> 19:50.014
[imitates Calvin]:
But I have to say this.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.755
You're welcome.[chuckles]

19:58.197 --> 20:01.722
Hey, Tina? I got
a surprise for you.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.028
I'm too tired to check
under your hood tonight, Calvin.[chuckles]

20:05.291 --> 20:07.423
Look, I promise
you're gonna love it.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.556
Now, it's no Birkin bag,

20:09.686 --> 20:10.948
but...

20:12.211 --> 20:15.779
TINA:
[gasps] Oh! Oh! Oh, my God!

20:15.910 --> 20:19.479
A car with my face on it?!

20:19.653 --> 20:22.046
Oh!

20:22.221 --> 20:24.353
A Birkin could never!

20:24.484 --> 20:25.833
Oh!

20:26.007 --> 20:27.182
Thank you, Calvin.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.228
I just wanted to show you

20:29.358 --> 20:31.578
that I believe in you
and your business.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.188
You are the sweetest.

20:33.319 --> 20:37.627
Now, why don't you lock up

20:37.801 --> 20:41.240
so I can unwrap you.

20:41.414 --> 20:43.459
Mm.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.463
Uh, Joe?

20:47.637 --> 20:49.073
Time to get on up
out of here, man.
