09:05.878 --> 09:07.129
{\an7}Yeah,
I asked around,

09:07.213 --> 09:09.006
{\an8}and there's a bar
not too far from here

09:09.090 --> 09:10.258
{\an8}where the local paniolos

09:10.341 --> 09:11.759
{\an8}like to hang out.

09:10.341 --> 09:11.759
{\an8}Oh, right.

09:11.842 --> 09:13.177
{\an8}Yeah, the Cattle Prod.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.305
{\an8}What, you know it?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.305
{\an7}I do,

09:16.389 --> 09:18.808
{\an9}I do.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.808
{\an8}When did you go there?

09:18.891 --> 09:20.851
{\an9}Oh, you think I had
no life before I met you?

09:22.353 --> 09:24.146
{\an8}All right, why don't you,
uh, why don't you two

09:24.230 --> 09:26.023
{\an8}go down, check this bar out,

09:26.107 --> 09:28.317
{\an8}see if, uh, anybody saw
our victim last night.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.194
{\an8}This guy was so drunk,
it's possible he found

09:30.278 --> 09:31.320
{\an8}some trouble that
followed him home.

09:31.404 --> 09:32.280
{\an9}TANI:
Come on, cowboy.

09:35.283 --> 09:37.201
{\an8}♪ Livin' in ♪

09:37.285 --> 09:41.372
{\an8}♪ 'Cause I got friends
in low places... ♪

09:41.455 --> 09:43.249
{\an8}Oh, makes sense.

09:43.332 --> 09:45.626
{\an7}You were, uh,
in a biker gang.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.044
{\an9}Uh, no.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.504
{\an8}You dated a ranch hand?

09:48.587 --> 09:50.256
{\an8}Joons, there's
no big mystery.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.674
{\an8}It's just a bar.

09:51.757 --> 09:53.384
{\an8}Sure, it's just a bar

09:53.467 --> 09:55.636
{\an8}that's an hour away from your
house that you're suspiciously

09:55.720 --> 09:58.139
{\an8}familiar with.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.682
{\an8}Can I get you guys anything?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.142
{\an9}Five-O.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.351
{\an8}We just need to ask
you some questions.

10:02.435 --> 10:03.853
{\an8}Shoot.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.354
{\an8}Have I seen you in here before?

10:05.438 --> 10:08.357
{\an8}Oh, maybe once or twice,
long time ago.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.900
{\an3}Okay.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.902
{\an8}Do you know this guy?

10:11.986 --> 10:13.863
Not really, no.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.866
But he was in here last night,

10:16.949 --> 10:18.868
if that's what you're asking.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.162
Guy was in a real partying mood,
buying up drinks for everybody.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.330
Not just any old liquor.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.249
{\an5}Demolished all
my top-shelf tequila.

10:22.413 --> 10:25.249
You know why?

10:25.333 --> 10:26.709
When a customer's
flashing cash like that,

10:26.792 --> 10:27.918
{\an3}I don't ask
questions.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.378
{\an5}I just serve the drinks.

10:28.002 --> 10:29.378
So, basically,

10:29.462 --> 10:31.547
he was wearing a giant
flashing sign that said,

10:31.630 --> 10:32.673
"Rob me now."

10:31.630 --> 10:32.673
{\an1}Yeah.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.384
Hey, uh,
did you notice if anyone

10:35.468 --> 10:37.011
{\an4}followed him out
when he left?

10:35.468 --> 10:37.011
{\an3}Sorry.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.555
{\an3}It was real busy. I didn't
even see him leave.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.725
This guy
get in some kind of trouble?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.894
Yeah, you could say that.
We're gonna need to see

10:44.977 --> 10:46.687
all the receipts
for the credit card transactions

10:46.771 --> 10:47.730
from last night.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.565
Also, if you have
any security cam footage...

10:49.649 --> 10:51.484
Yeah.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.197
{\an3}Hey, now I remember.
Tani, right?

10:56.280 --> 10:58.407
{\an3}You used to come in for
the Sunday Night Roundup.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.241
The Sunday Night what now?

10:59.325 --> 11:00.743
{\an3}The Sunday Night
Roundup. That's our

11:00.826 --> 11:02.286
weekly line dancing competition.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.080
{\an3}Tani here won three
weeks in a row.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.706
Four. But who's counting?

11:05.790 --> 11:08.584
{\an3}So, did you hang up your
dancing boots or something?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.253
No. No, I was just...
You know, I figured it was time

11:11.337 --> 11:12.588
to give someone else
a chance to win.

11:12.671 --> 11:13.631
Also, things ended

11:13.714 --> 11:15.466
{\an3}with the cowboy who
introduced me to this place.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.384
Oh, yeah? Don't tell me.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.219
{\an5}He broke your achy breaky heart?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.219
Uh, no.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.428
{\an3}He didn't. It was
the other way around.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.389
{\an4}Okay.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.389
{\an3}Hey, you ought to come
back, reclaim your crown.

11:21.472 --> 11:24.433
{\an3}Although I got to warn you, the
competition's gotten stiffer.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.435
Oh, really? Well,
if they're coming for the Queen,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.270
they best not miss.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.689
Who are you?

11:30.773 --> 11:32.441
How's softball?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.860
Coach ever move you to left
like you wanted?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.781
{\an1}(chuckles):
He did, actually.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.658
{\an5}Oh. Cool.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.658
{\an1}(chuckles)

11:42.576 --> 11:46.872
Maybe you could come
see me play sometime?

11:47.873 --> 11:50.167
I would love to.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.754
But it's complicated.

11:53.838 --> 11:54.964
It's okay.

11:55.047 --> 11:56.966
No, I-I understand.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.635
(engine shuts off)

12:01.595 --> 12:03.431
{\an3}Here.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.807
For lunch.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.933
{\an5}(chuckles):
No.

12:04.890 --> 12:05.933
No, take it.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.936
{\an1}(chuckles)

12:09.019 --> 12:11.313
Thanks.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.817
Okay, yeah. And I will pick you
up after school, too.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.319
So, what time
is cheer practice done?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.446
Actually, I-I decided

12:18.529 --> 12:21.157
{\an4}I didn't want to go out
for cheer this year.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.157
{\an3}What?

12:21.240 --> 12:23.826
You were captain last year.
What happened?

12:23.909 --> 12:26.287
I don't know. Just...

12:26.370 --> 12:29.331
{\an1}The other girls, um,
aren't very nice.

12:30.541 --> 12:32.835
The money I gave you
for cheer uniform.

12:32.918 --> 12:35.546
Did he take it?

12:35.629 --> 12:37.631
(sighs)

12:40.426 --> 12:41.385
{\an3}It's okay.

12:41.469 --> 12:43.137
Hey. It's okay.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.513
(school bell rings)

12:45.556 --> 12:47.600
Come on. Off to school.

12:49.393 --> 12:51.604
I'm gonna find him.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.571
(car door closes)

13:02.615 --> 13:04.533
TANI:
<i>These are all the people</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:06.076
{\an1}who were at the bar
last night when Kekaula

13:06.160 --> 13:08.078
{\an5}was flashing his cash around.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.078
{\an1}JUNIOR:
And none of them

13:08.162 --> 13:11.040
{\an1}have any priors except for the
occasional drunk and disorderly.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.208
We thought at first

13:12.291 --> 13:14.418
{\an3}that someone might've followed
him out, but according to

13:14.502 --> 13:15.836
{\an3}the security cam footage
in the parking lot,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
that was not the case.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.757
Kekaula left the bar last night
at 10:00 p.m. by himself.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.383
The next person to leave,

13:21.467 --> 13:23.552
uh, didn't leave
until 25 minutes later.

13:23.636 --> 13:25.221
{\an1}All right, well,
we need to get phone records

13:25.304 --> 13:26.597
{\an1}from all these people.
It's possible one of them

13:26.680 --> 13:27.765
{\an1}called the killer
and tipped them off.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.725
Okay, hold on.
Uh, we're-we're...

13:29.808 --> 13:31.894
we're thinking that this guy
got drug behind a horse

13:31.977 --> 13:33.604
{\an3}because he was flashing
some cash around

13:33.687 --> 13:34.605
at a bar?
That doesn't make sense to me.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.689
Number one. Number two,

13:35.773 --> 13:37.399
uh, if he was in debt,

13:37.483 --> 13:38.776
what is he celebrating?

13:38.859 --> 13:40.110
{\an6}GROVER:
All right, everybody.
Spread out.

13:40.194 --> 13:41.820
I got a little something
for you.

13:41.904 --> 13:45.449
So, I dug a little deeper
into the finances of our vic.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.034
It turns out

13:47.117 --> 13:49.411
he actually did get somebody

13:49.495 --> 13:50.955
{\an1}to finally loan him
some money.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.206
{\an3}Took out a small
business loan

13:52.289 --> 13:53.415
from a local credit union,

13:53.499 --> 13:56.627
{\an3}and he bought himself some
digging and trenching equipment.

13:56.710 --> 13:57.586
{\an1}DANNY:
For what?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.587
{\an5}Irrigation?

13:57.670 --> 13:58.587
{\an3}Well,

13:58.671 --> 13:59.588
that's part of it.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.965
According to the loan officer,

14:01.048 --> 14:02.550
Kekaula got the bright idea

14:02.633 --> 14:05.469
of turning his ranch
into a macadamia nut farm.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.222
He even hired some hands to
help him turn over the soil.

14:08.305 --> 14:09.598
Well, that makes sense.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.433
{\an1}I hear there's good money
in macadamia farms.

14:11.517 --> 14:13.435
{\an1}Yes, sir. But here's
where the story

14:13.519 --> 14:14.478
{\an5}gets a little...

14:13.519 --> 14:14.478
Don't do it.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.230
...nutty.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.107
{\an3}Nice one.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.107
There it is.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.484
{\an1}I caught up
with one of the ranch hands

14:20.568 --> 14:22.111
that Kekaula had hired.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.280
{\an3}The guy tells me
that three days ago,

14:24.363 --> 14:26.240
{\an3}him and his fellow ranch
hands were sitting around,

14:26.323 --> 14:27.783
having a smoke break,

14:27.866 --> 14:30.286
{\an3}when he notices
Kekaula with a shovel,

14:30.369 --> 14:31.787
just digging a hole by himself.

14:31.870 --> 14:33.455
All of a sudden,
out of the blue,

14:33.539 --> 14:35.791
{\an3}he turns to 'em,
sends 'em all home

14:35.874 --> 14:37.626
for the afternoon.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.460
And then he tells them,

14:38.544 --> 14:40.671
{\an1}"You don't have
to come back, either."

14:40.754 --> 14:42.464
{\an3}This guy just
took out a loan

14:42.548 --> 14:45.134
{\an1}for all of this brand-new
digging and trenching equipment,

14:45.217 --> 14:46.468
{\an1}and then you let go
of the guys

14:46.552 --> 14:48.137
who were supposed
to run it for you?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.306
What do you think? He found
something on his property,

14:50.389 --> 14:51.807
{\an1}started this whole thing
in motion?

14:51.890 --> 14:53.350
{\an1}That's exactly what
I'm thinking.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.643
{\an1}As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna go out

14:54.727 --> 14:57.146
to the site right now
and see what this...

14:57.229 --> 14:59.231
would-be nut farmer
was trying to dig up.

14:59.315 --> 15:00.983
All right. Keep us posted.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.991
What do you say, Duke?

15:09.074 --> 15:10.659
Hey, Cap.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.828
{\an1}You guys
found human remains

15:12.911 --> 15:14.496
way out here?

15:12.911 --> 15:14.496
{\an3}Two sets.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.624
{\an3}Looks like your vic
found this burial site

15:16.707 --> 15:19.001
{\an3}when he was planting
all his macadamia trees.

15:19.084 --> 15:21.545
Would explain
why he stopped digging.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.839
That'll do it.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.341
{\an3}(sighs)

15:25.424 --> 15:27.509
{\an1}What it doesn't explain,
though, is why finding

15:27.593 --> 15:29.511
{\an1}these two old skeletons
would...

15:29.595 --> 15:31.096
got a guy tortured and killed.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.192
Hey. Didn't expect
to see you again today.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.318
(chuckles softly)

15:44.401 --> 15:46.195
I need a favor.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.197
Would this have

15:48.280 --> 15:50.366
{\an3}anything to do with that phone
call you received earlier?

15:50.449 --> 15:52.701
I need to track someone down.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.162
{\an5}But if you have
other plans...

15:52.785 --> 15:55.162
Oh, no, I...

15:55.245 --> 15:57.373
{\an3}It's okay. My dry cleaning
isn't going anywhere.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.832
{\an5}(chuckles softly)

15:57.456 --> 15:58.832
{\an3}Course, uh,

15:58.916 --> 16:01.210
{\an3}might help if I knew
who we're looking for.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.295
(sighs)

16:07.299 --> 16:09.301
My ex-husband.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.553
{\an1}Yeah.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.137
{\an1}I know.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.097
I will explain everything,

16:13.180 --> 16:14.765
{\an1}but right now
I just really need to find him.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.100
Jake,

16:16.183 --> 16:17.726
{\an1}my ex,

16:17.810 --> 16:19.520
he used to play in a lot
of the local card rooms.

16:19.603 --> 16:20.771
{\an1}I was hoping
you might know some people

16:20.854 --> 16:22.106
who are connected to that scene.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.734
{\an3}Yeah. Let me
make some calls.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.195
{\an1}GROVER:
Lady and gentleman,

16:28.278 --> 16:30.698
here's what we know.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.241
Now, according to Noelani,

16:32.324 --> 16:36.036
these bones are between 130
and 140 years old.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.454
One male, one female.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.456
Now, these fractures

16:39.540 --> 16:41.917
{\an1}in the bones in the breastplate,
that would indicate

16:42.000 --> 16:44.211
{\an3}that the female was
shot twice in the chest.

16:44.294 --> 16:46.255
And the gentleman
has one exit wound

16:46.338 --> 16:47.423
through the top of his skull.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.258
{\an3}Which would suggest
that he was shot

16:49.341 --> 16:51.135
{\an5}from under the chin, right?

16:49.341 --> 16:51.135
{\an1}TANI:
So we're looking

16:51.218 --> 16:52.302
{\an5}at a murder-suicide.

16:51.218 --> 16:52.302
{\an3}GROVER:
Yeah.

16:52.386 --> 16:53.429
I thought so, too,

16:53.512 --> 16:55.097
{\an3}but these two
were both killed

16:55.180 --> 16:56.181
{\an3}with two different
caliber weapons.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.183
{\an6}STEVE:
Well, at least we
know how they died.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.394
{\an5}Where are we at on
IDing the remains?

16:58.267 --> 17:00.394
Well, the lab

17:00.477 --> 17:03.897
{\an3}is running DNA sample
through various databases.

17:03.981 --> 17:05.566
But, thanks to property records,

17:05.648 --> 17:07.608
I'm able to tell you who owned

17:07.693 --> 17:08.777
that ranch at the time

17:08.861 --> 17:10.112
{\an1}those bodies
were both buried there.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.238
It was a man by the name

17:11.320 --> 17:13.449
of Abel Ho'okano.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.284
{\an1}I did a search
on his name and found it

17:15.367 --> 17:18.704
{\an1}in an old article in the
<i>Pacific Commercial Advertiser.</i>

17:18.787 --> 17:20.414
Real feel-good story, too.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.832
Here we have a paniolo

17:21.915 --> 17:24.460
who was working as
a local ranch hand.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.462
Decided to travel over
to the mainland to ply

17:26.545 --> 17:27.588
{\an1}his trade.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.631
{\an1}And plying
actually went pretty good,

17:29.715 --> 17:31.258
{\an1}because when
he returned to Oahu,

17:31.341 --> 17:33.677
{\an1}he was flush enough
to buy that homestead

17:33.761 --> 17:35.596
{\an1}and settle down there
with his missus.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.639
All right, so, we're thinking
the bones we found

17:37.723 --> 17:40.184
{\an5}belong to Ho'okano and his wife.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.184
{\an1}TANI:
Right.

17:40.267 --> 17:43.103
But if this is what
our vic discovered,

17:43.187 --> 17:45.022
why was he out celebrating?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.482
Finding human remains

17:46.565 --> 17:48.692
{\an1}on your property means
you have to call in the state,

17:48.776 --> 17:50.027
and then they shut down
all activity

17:50.110 --> 17:51.320
{\an5}to investigate.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.320
{\an3}STEVE:
In the meantime,

17:51.403 --> 17:53.197
you can't build. You
can't ranch or farm.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.823
{\an6}It makes the
land worthless.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.823
Hmm.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.493
{\an5}Yo.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.493
Yo. So, the lab just called,
and they got

17:57.576 --> 17:59.745
a DNA hit
on our 130-year-old man.

17:59.828 --> 18:03.332
It was a familial match in one
of those genealogy services.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.166
Guy's name is

18:04.249 --> 18:06.168
{\an3}Kip Ho'okano. He
lives here on island.

18:06.251 --> 18:09.338
Well, let's hope that Kip can
shed some light on why finding

18:09.421 --> 18:10.881
his ancestor's bones

18:10.964 --> 18:12.966
{\an5}is causing all this ruckus.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.966
Yeah, let's hope so.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.426
He's on his way in now.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.478
{\an1}You're gonna make a left
at the light here.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.689
I'm sorry
to pull you into all this.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.983
I mean, last thing
I wanted to do was have all this

18:30.067 --> 18:32.319
{\an5}follow me into my new job.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.319
{\an1}Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, listen,

18:32.402 --> 18:33.695
{\an1}you don't have
to be sorry, okay?

18:33.779 --> 18:34.738
If there's one thing

18:34.822 --> 18:36.198
I understand, it's wanting

18:36.281 --> 18:37.741
to keep your past in the past.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.204
All right. Right up here.

18:47.584 --> 18:50.671
I never thought I'd fall
for a guy like him.

18:50.754 --> 18:53.715
{\an3}Older. Divorced.
With a kid.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.802
(sighs)
But he was charming.

18:58.178 --> 18:59.930
And Olivia.

19:02.140 --> 19:05.060
The little family we made.

19:05.144 --> 19:08.063
{\an1}When did you realize
he had a problem?

19:09.147 --> 19:11.275
About four months
into our marriage.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.318
I had blinders on.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.071
{\an3}I missed some pretty
obvious red flags.

19:16.154 --> 19:17.573
And then one day, I discovered

19:17.656 --> 19:19.449
that he emptied out
our joint bank accounts.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.701
{\an5}Hmm.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.701
{\an3}He promised

19:20.784 --> 19:21.910
that he would pay it back,
of course,

19:21.994 --> 19:24.079
but it's not about that.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.832
{\an3}I mean, how-how do you
trust somebody after that?

19:26.915 --> 19:28.417
But even then,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.252
I ended up staying longer
than I should have.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.753
Because of Olivia.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.214
Yeah.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.967
Leaving her was the hardest
part about that whole thing.

19:38.176 --> 19:40.262
You know, we still
keep in touch, of course.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.098
And I see her often enough
to make sure

19:43.182 --> 19:45.934
that her dad's staying out
of trouble, which he has been.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.811
{\an3}Until now.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.479
He stole money
from his own daughter.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.441
{\an3}All right?
That's a new low.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.068
{\an6}If he's willing
to do that...

19:52.524 --> 19:55.068
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.570
You'll see.

19:56.653 --> 19:58.322
We're gonna find him.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.909
Really, thank you.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.786
{\an3}(chuckles):
I'm so sorry to dump

20:04.870 --> 20:05.913
all of this on you.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.706
I mean, I haven't told anybody
that I was married,

20:07.789 --> 20:09.166
not even Steve.

20:11.376 --> 20:13.295
{\an3}In case you haven't noticed,
I'm not really a sharer.

20:13.378 --> 20:14.963
Oh, yeah.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.590
(chuckles)

20:16.673 --> 20:19.801
Nearly impossible to make it
here as a rancher these days.

20:19.885 --> 20:22.095
Land's too expensive.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.806
{\an1}Cheap meat from China's priced
everyone out of the market.

20:24.890 --> 20:25.849
{\an1}That's why
I went into accounting.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.517
I wrangle

20:27.601 --> 20:29.019
{\an1}numbers.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.313
This is just to remind me
where I come from.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.940
So, how exactly are you

20:33.023 --> 20:34.942
related to Abel Ho'okano?

20:35.025 --> 20:36.276
Oh.

20:36.360 --> 20:40.364
Abel was my great-great-uncle.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.159
If you don't mind me asking,

20:44.242 --> 20:46.036
{\an1}what's this case
you're investigating?

20:46.119 --> 20:47.955
{\an3}TANI: The person
who now owns

20:48.038 --> 20:50.123
Abel's land was killed,
so we're just

20:50.207 --> 20:51.792
trying to get to the bottom
of what happened.

20:51.875 --> 20:53.669
Hmm.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.337
Well,

20:55.420 --> 20:56.964
{\an1}as you probably know,
that ranch

20:57.047 --> 20:58.840
hasn't been in my family
for over a hundred years,

20:58.924 --> 21:01.343
so I'm not sure
how I can help.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.303
That being said,

21:03.387 --> 21:05.389
{\an1}I can't say
I'm too surprised.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.391
Why's that?

21:07.474 --> 21:09.518
Well,
because that land's cursed.

21:09.601 --> 21:12.521
Uh, at least, that's what
my father always told me.

21:12.604 --> 21:16.274
{\an1}Oh, yeah. No, that's why
my family sold it.

21:16.358 --> 21:18.360
{\an1}You know, I typically don't buy
into stuff like that,

21:18.443 --> 21:19.861
{\an1}but that ranch
has brought

21:19.945 --> 21:22.322
{\an1}nothing but heartache
to anyone who's ever owned it,

21:22.406 --> 21:26.076
{\an1}starting
with Great-Uncle Abel himself.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.037
So, this...

21:29.121 --> 21:30.455
so-called curse--

21:30.539 --> 21:32.082
walk us through
that, would you?

21:32.165 --> 21:34.584
Well, let's see.

21:34.668 --> 21:38.213
Around 1870 or so,

21:38.296 --> 21:41.717
Abel sets off to the mainland
with his friend, Buddy Makoi,

21:41.800 --> 21:43.760
to seek out their fortunes.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.387
Now, they made it to Colorado,

21:45.470 --> 21:47.180
where legend has it

21:47.264 --> 21:51.018
they came into a small fortune
of Civil War-era gold coins.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.353
<i>Now, the story</i>
<i>that's been passed down</i>

21:53.437 --> 21:55.022
<i>is that they won it</i>
<i>through gambling,</i>

21:55.105 --> 21:57.065
<i>although some say</i>
<i>violence was involved.</i>

21:57.149 --> 21:58.775
<i>Now, whatever happened,</i>

21:58.859 --> 22:00.569
<i>it's a matter of fact</i>
<i>that the two of 'em</i>

22:00.652 --> 22:02.404
<i>brought the money home</i>
<i>and used it</i>

22:02.487 --> 22:04.781
<i>to buy adjoining ranches</i>
<i>in Kaneohe.</i>

22:04.865 --> 22:06.533
<i>Now, see, the problems started</i>

22:06.616 --> 22:07.909
<i>when they couldn't agree</i>
<i>on what to do</i>

22:07.993 --> 22:09.786
with the rest of the gold.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.914
{\an1}And that disagreement
eventually turned violent.

22:12.998 --> 22:13.790
<i>Abel's wife was killed</i>

22:13.874 --> 22:15.876
<i>by a member</i>
<i>of the Makoi family.</i>

22:15.959 --> 22:18.420
<i>So my great-uncle grabs</i>
<i>the rest of the coins</i>

22:18.503 --> 22:20.380
<i>and takes off</i>
<i>for the mainland.</i>

22:20.464 --> 22:22.090
He was never seen again.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.092
You know, to this day,
there's still bad blood

22:24.176 --> 22:26.928
{\an1}between the two families
over what happened.

22:27.012 --> 22:29.890
{\an1}That story's lived on
for over a century.

22:29.973 --> 22:32.809
{\an1}At least amongst
the Ho'okanos

22:32.893 --> 22:34.978
and the Makois.

22:36.021 --> 22:37.647
Well, Mr. Ho'okano,

22:37.731 --> 22:39.816
I'm afraid that, um,
it turns out

22:39.900 --> 22:43.403
your great-uncle never did
make it to the mainland.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.781
STEVE:
<i>All right. So,</i>

22:45.864 --> 22:47.407
{\an1}the family legend
got one thing wrong:

22:47.491 --> 22:49.785
{\an1}Abel Ho'okano didn't flee
with the gold.

22:49.868 --> 22:51.119
There's no way
he could have.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.288
{\an3}I mean, his bones reveal
that he shot himself

22:53.371 --> 22:55.624
{\an3}standing in the same grave
he dug for his wife.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.084
{\an5}(gunshot)

22:55.707 --> 22:57.084
TANI:
<i>So if Abel</i>

22:57.167 --> 22:59.586
{\an3}actually did take this gold
to the grave with him,

22:59.669 --> 23:01.963
{\an3}that would be what
our vic stumbled across

23:02.047 --> 23:03.090
{\an3}when he was
tilling the soil,

23:03.173 --> 23:05.258
a bag of coins that, today,
would be worth millions.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.134
{\an3}Well, it certainly
would explain

23:06.218 --> 23:07.052
{\an3}why he was out
celebrating that night.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.137
The guy was
up to his eyeballs in debt

23:09.221 --> 23:10.138
and literally just

23:10.222 --> 23:11.681
struck gold.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.681
{\an1}All right.

23:11.765 --> 23:14.267
{\an1}Maybe he let slip his discovery
to the wrong person,

23:14.351 --> 23:15.310
{\an1}which explains
why he was dragged

23:15.394 --> 23:17.979
<i>around his property</i>
<i>until he was murdered.</i>

23:18.063 --> 23:19.940
{\an1}Somebody was clearly trying
to get out of him

23:20.023 --> 23:21.149
where he'd stashed those coins.

23:21.233 --> 23:22.484
{\an3}Hold on.

23:22.567 --> 23:25.320
{\an3}Abel Ho'okano's partner
from back in the day,

23:25.403 --> 23:26.154
Buddy Makoi...

23:26.238 --> 23:27.280
What about him?

23:27.364 --> 23:30.283
I've-I've seen that name before.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.327
When we ran the names
of everyone who was at the bar

23:32.410 --> 23:33.703
that night with the vic.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.835
Raymond Makoi.
Maybe he's a descendant.

23:39.918 --> 23:40.836
{\an3}GROVER:
Well, he certainly

23:40.919 --> 23:42.838
{\an3}would understand the
significance of our vic

23:42.921 --> 23:44.423
finding that gold
on that particular property.

23:45.423 --> 23:47.008
{\an3}The Makoi
family ranch--

23:47.092 --> 23:48.718
it's under three miles

23:48.802 --> 23:50.554
{\an1}from our vic's
property.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.556
{\an1}It's accessible
by road

23:52.639 --> 23:54.057
or horseback.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.934
All right. I think it's time
we paid the Makois a visit.

24:00.772 --> 24:04.317
{\an8}♪ ♪

24:13.118 --> 24:14.870
{\an3}Clear!

24:14.953 --> 24:16.329
{\an1}Clear!

24:19.291 --> 24:20.333
{\an3}Clear.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.377
Okay, they're gone.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.173
{\an3}Yeah, but wherever
they went, it looks like

24:26.256 --> 24:28.550
{\an3}they took enough firepower
to arm a small country.

24:28.633 --> 24:31.511
{\an1}GROVER:
Steve! Danny!

24:31.595 --> 24:34.890
{\an1}Look halfway up
that second ridge there.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.308
{\an3}See where
I'm pointing?

24:36.391 --> 24:37.392
{\an1}Ducking behind
the tree line now.

24:37.475 --> 24:38.727
{\an5}STEVE: Yeah.

24:37.475 --> 24:38.727
I made out three,

24:38.810 --> 24:40.770
maybe four guys. On horseback.

24:40.854 --> 24:42.230
{\an1}They probably got
a few ahead of 'em.

24:42.314 --> 24:43.231

bringing someone with you.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.762
{\an1}Listen, the sooner you tell us
what we need to know,

25:13.845 --> 25:16.097

coming around here

25:27.901 --> 25:29.819
{\an3}quite a bit lately,
until a few days ago.

25:29.903 --> 25:31.112
And then what happened?

25:31.196 --> 25:32.739
He hit a bad streak.

25:32.822 --> 25:35.116
Or, rather, it hit him.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.619
{\an3}Haven't seen him

25:57.389 --> 25:58.306
He gets desperate,

25:58.390 --> 26:00.475
{\an1}and there's nothing
he won't do to keep playing.

26:01.518 --> 26:02.435

26:07.732 --> 26:08.775
Hey.

26:08.858 --> 26:11.069

able to help us. Come on.

All right,

26:15.031 --> 26:17.325
{\an3}since McGarrett's gonna ride
up the trail after these guys,

26:17.409 --> 26:19.160

to cover this route

26:19.244 --> 26:20.954
that goes all the way behind
the Kualoa mountain.

26:21.037 --> 26:21.955

26:22.038 --> 26:23.331
The road ends here.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.000

a roadblock here.

26:27.585 --> 26:29.212
{\an3}All right, someone should
stay back here at the ranch,

back around this way.

34:54.382 --> 34:55.510
{\an5}Am I gonna hate it?

34:54.382 --> 34:55.510
{\an1}Well...

34:55.592 --> 34:57.178
{\an5}(loud gunfire)

34:55.592 --> 34:57.178
Aah!

34:57.261 --> 34:58.638
{\an3}All right,
what's the plan?

34:58.721 --> 35:00.848
{\an1}Take this.

35:00.932 --> 35:04.018
{\an1}You can use the three bullets
and lay down some cover.

35:04.101 --> 35:06.020
{\an3}Oh, okay. What
are you gonna do?

35:06.103 --> 35:08.523
{\an5}I'm gonna improvise.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.523
{\an3}Whoa, whoa. You're
gonna improvise?

35:08.606 --> 35:09.774
That's not a plan!

35:09.857 --> 35:11.234
{\an3}That's the opposite
of a plan, you...

35:11.317 --> 35:12.610
nincompoop!

35:14.529 --> 35:16.572
(rapid gunfire continues)

35:26.207 --> 35:27.208
(groans)

35:28.251 --> 35:30.378
(grunts)

35:30.461 --> 35:33.256
(grunting)

35:37.301 --> 35:38.344
(whistles sharply)

35:41.472 --> 35:42.431
(bullets ricocheting)

35:42.515 --> 35:43.766
{\an4}MAN:
On your right!
Look out!

35:51.440 --> 35:52.859
(gunfire continues)

35:58.489 --> 36:00.241
(grunts)

36:09.292 --> 36:11.419
(both grunting)

36:11.502 --> 36:13.421
{\an3}(groaning)

36:17.133 --> 36:19.886
(both grunting)

36:22.346 --> 36:24.098
{\an6}(groaning)

36:22.346 --> 36:24.098
{\an1}(grunting)

36:34.358 --> 36:35.651
(gun chamber clicks)

36:37.528 --> 36:39.572
(grunting)

36:48.372 --> 36:50.958
(high-pitched ringing)

36:51.042 --> 36:53.377
{\an1}(groans)

36:55.755 --> 36:57.465
{\an3}(yelling)

36:57.548 --> 37:00.217
(gunshot, groans)

37:03.221 --> 37:04.513
{\an3}Hi.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.307
Why'd you leave the cabin?

37:06.390 --> 37:08.476
{\an5}That wasn't part of the plan.

37:06.390 --> 37:08.476
{\an3}Oh.

37:08.559 --> 37:12.146
{\an3}Uh, no, you told me to
improvise, so I improvised.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.106
Fine.

37:16.609 --> 37:18.611
{\an1}Uh...

37:18.694 --> 37:20.321
I want an apology

37:20.404 --> 37:22.281
for calling me a nincompoop.

37:22.365 --> 37:24.575
You're a nincompoop.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.620
You're welcome.

37:28.579 --> 37:29.997
{\an1}(groans)

37:30.081 --> 37:31.999
{\an3}You okay?

37:32.083 --> 37:34.126
{\an5}Yes.

37:32.083 --> 37:34.126
{\an3}Good. Good.

37:36.462 --> 37:38.673
(garbled radio transmission)

37:38.756 --> 37:40.341
Can I ask you a question?

37:40.424 --> 37:41.509
{\an1}Yeah.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.387
How in <i> the</i> hell did the two
of you do all of this?

37:44.470 --> 37:46.013
We improvised.

37:46.097 --> 37:47.348
{\an5}The two of you?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.348
{\an3}DANNY:
Yeah, it's a-a...

37:47.431 --> 37:49.517
long story.
Um, we ran out of bullets,

37:49.600 --> 37:51.352
{\an1}and Steve did something
with a rope.

37:51.435 --> 37:53.604
{\an3}What about what
started all this?

37:53.688 --> 37:55.523
{\an5}The gold-- what
happened to it?

37:53.688 --> 37:55.523
We got our hands

37:55.606 --> 37:57.358
on one of their scouts
at one point.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.026
He, uh, told us
they came up here

37:59.110 --> 38:00.111
to stash the gold.
Of course,

38:00.194 --> 38:02.571
everything they went through
to get it, they weren't

38:02.655 --> 38:05.116
gonna give it back, so, uh, he
never told us where they put it.

38:05.199 --> 38:06.701
{\an3}So you're saying
that there's millions

38:06.784 --> 38:08.494
of dollars worth
of coins up here,

38:08.577 --> 38:10.329
{\an6}you don't know
where it is?

38:08.577 --> 38:10.329
DANNY: Well,

38:10.413 --> 38:12.039
{\an4}Steve killed everybody,
so there's no one really to ask.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.039
{\an3}Yeah.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.208
'Cause I was kind of focused on
saving our asses, not getting us

38:14.291 --> 38:16.419
booked on <i> Antiques Roadshow,</i>
but, you know.

38:16.502 --> 38:18.421
{\an3}Well, I guess that gold is
just gonna stay lost for maybe

38:18.504 --> 38:19.839
another 130 years.

38:19.922 --> 38:21.215
{\an3}Assuming word doesn't
get out that it's here,

38:21.298 --> 38:23.009
{\an3}in which case, these
hills are gonna be

38:23.092 --> 38:25.386
{\an3}crawling with wannabe
Indiana Joneses.

38:25.469 --> 38:28.055
{\an3}Well, it sounds like a problem
for tomorrow. For right now,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.724
{\an3}we need to get you guys
down this mountain

38:29.807 --> 38:33.144
{\an3}so that, uh, we get out of
here before dark, all right?

38:33.227 --> 38:35.229
(horse sputters)

38:35.312 --> 38:37.064
{\an5}(horse neighs)

38:35.312 --> 38:37.064
Oh, hey, uh,

38:37.148 --> 38:40.693
do you think the horses'll fit
on the ATVs or...? No.

38:40.776 --> 38:42.236
(horse neighing)

38:42.319 --> 38:44.071
{\an5}(horse sputters)

38:42.319 --> 38:44.071
Uh...

38:49.326 --> 38:50.703
(poker chips clink)

38:50.786 --> 38:52.288
(indistinct conversation)

39:04.884 --> 39:06.927
It's 200 to buy in.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.138
Actually, I'm here for him.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.266
Quinn.

39:14.310 --> 39:17.396
Oh, uh, hey, hey, I, um...

39:17.480 --> 39:19.315
I can explain this.

39:19.398 --> 39:21.484
Quinn, um...

39:21.567 --> 39:23.194
{\an1}Get up.

39:23.277 --> 39:26.113
{\an3}Yeah, I... I don't
know how the time...

39:26.197 --> 39:28.657
{\an1}Get. Up.

39:28.741 --> 39:29.658
Oh, Quinn, I am so sorry.

39:29.742 --> 39:31.952
{\an1}I was on a <i> run,</i>
and I lost track of time.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.121
{\an3}And I gave Olivia money,
and she's bigger now,

39:34.205 --> 39:35.122
so she's-she's fine.

39:35.206 --> 39:39.251
{\an1}Three days. You left her alone
for three days!

39:41.212 --> 39:43.172
{\an5}Turn around.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.172
Cops?

39:43.255 --> 39:44.799
Turn around!

39:44.882 --> 39:46.801
{\an4}JAKE:
Come on, Q, hey.
Hey, just relax.

39:46.884 --> 39:47.802
{\an1}You don't have
to do this.

39:47.885 --> 39:48.844
{\an1}We-we don't need
to get anybody else involved.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.680
{\an1}You're being booked on
a misdemeanor gambling charge.

39:51.764 --> 39:54.308
{\an1}I will post your bond,
make sure you just get probation

39:54.391 --> 39:55.810
{\an1}on the condition
that you enter a program

39:55.893 --> 39:57.895
and stick to it this time.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.273
Okay, then.

40:02.274 --> 40:04.151
I-I need help.

40:04.235 --> 40:06.195
I know it. I know it.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.823
{\an3}I can admit it,
okay? I need help.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.158
But you don't need
to do this, Quinn.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.326
You're right.

40:12.409 --> 40:14.829
It doesn't have to be this way,

40:14.912 --> 40:17.623
{\an1}but I am doing this
for Olivia, and

40:17.706 --> 40:19.166
{\an1}you are lucky
that I am not charging you

40:19.250 --> 40:20.543
with child endangerment.

40:20.626 --> 40:24.463
{\an1}But make no mistake--
next time, I will. Move.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.676
You mess up again,
you will go to jail,

40:28.759 --> 40:30.344
and you will lose your daughter.

40:30.427 --> 40:32.638
You will have custody
of your daughter revoked!

40:32.721 --> 40:34.974
{\an1}Quinn, I'm sorry.
Hey, I'm sorry, Quinn.

40:35.057 --> 40:36.684
I'm sorry, okay?

40:36.767 --> 40:38.227
Don't do this.

40:38.310 --> 40:40.604
Quinn?! Q?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.566
Here, just talk to me.

40:43.649 --> 40:45.317
Hey, just... Don't leave!

40:45.401 --> 40:46.610
Quinn, just talk to me!

40:58.455 --> 41:00.708
You okay?

41:07.464 --> 41:09.466
(crying)

41:11.469 --> 41:13.554
(quietly):
Hey.

41:13.637 --> 41:17.183
(inhales sharply, pants)

41:23.439 --> 41:25.608
(insects trilling)

41:37.286 --> 41:38.245
Whoa.

41:38.329 --> 41:39.663
(horse sputters)

41:45.794 --> 41:49.298
You know, I've always
taken sunsets for granted.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.386
{\an3}Probably 'cause I figured
I'd see a million more.

41:59.350 --> 42:01.769
But just 'cause

42:01.852 --> 42:03.103
you see something every day

42:03.187 --> 42:04.897
doesn't make it
any less special, huh?

42:04.980 --> 42:06.774
{\an3}In fact,

42:06.857 --> 42:09.777
{\an3}I think those are the things
that you're gonna miss the most

42:09.860 --> 42:11.278
in the end, you know?

42:11.362 --> 42:13.405
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.616
You know,
I-I think about sunsets,

42:15.699 --> 42:19.787
I think about, um,
the sun setting,

42:19.870 --> 42:22.289
{\an1}which means
it's gonna go down,

42:22.373 --> 42:24.124
which means
it's gonna be dark, and then,

42:24.208 --> 42:26.502
we'd have to sleep in the...
in the woods here, which...

42:26.585 --> 42:28.629
{\an6}Can I... can I
savor this moment?

42:26.585 --> 42:28.629
You-you can have the moment.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.506
{\an5}Just for a second.

42:28.712 --> 42:30.506
Yeah, take the moment.

42:30.589 --> 42:31.799
You have the moment,
I'll go find

42:31.882 --> 42:33.634
{\an1}a squirrel
to grill for dinner.

42:33.717 --> 42:35.594
{\an5}Does that sound appetizing?

42:33.717 --> 42:35.594
{\an3}A squirrel.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.597
Ten years.
You've been here ten years?

42:38.681 --> 42:39.932
Mm-hmm.

42:40.015 --> 42:41.600
You ever once seen a squirrel,
Danny?

42:41.684 --> 42:43.686
Hmm-mm.

42:43.769 --> 42:46.605
{\an3}No, 'cause
there are none.

42:46.689 --> 42:48.107
How have you not learned that?

42:48.190 --> 42:49.483
{\an5}I-I guess I'm a slow learner.

42:48.190 --> 42:49.483
{\an3}Uh-huh.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.693
{\an1}If I wasn't,
I probably would have gotten

42:50.776 --> 42:52.027
{\an1}a new partner
a long time ago, you know?

42:52.111 --> 42:53.529
{\an3}(clicks tongue)
Yeah.

42:54.571 --> 42:56.949
Admit it, Danny.

42:57.032 --> 42:58.993
{\an1}You're gonna miss
this when it's done.

42:59.076 --> 43:01.537
{\an3}Yeah, maybe, but I would
never say it out loud.
