Everything okay? Oh, you
haven't touched your bacon.

00:08.114 --> 00:10.670
That's bacon? [ chuckling ] Who knew?

00:10.705 --> 00:13.254
Well, it's turkey bacon.
It's got a lot less fat in it.

00:13.296 --> 00:15.845
- Try it. It's good.
- You got any ketchup?

00:15.880 --> 00:18.367

Sorry.

He made me throw mine away, too.

Would you like a
cappuccino on the house?

00:25.617 --> 00:27.930
No, thanks.
I had enough coffee.

Where's the big tub of cream cheese?

00:30.816 --> 00:32.493

- All you had to do was open the café.

00:46.574 --> 00:48.918
- What did you do to him?
- Nothing! Call 911!

00:48.952 --> 00:52.434
- Sergeant! Get in here and help!
- Korsak: What going on?

00:52.472 --> 00:53.610
He just fell over. I
don't know what to do.

Newborns need a lot of human
contact to properly attach.

01:55.266 --> 01:57.975
- Take him out of the car seat.
- No, he was almost falling asleep.

01:58.009 --> 02:00.985
Okay.
Come here.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.859
Hello. How good.

02:02.893 --> 02:05.936
- His name's Mario.
- No, you can't name him Mario!

02:05.971 --> 02:08.043
Why not? It's latin.
It means "manly."

02:08.077 --> 02:11.086
- Yeah. So there.
- Hey, Maura, you ready to swab me?

02:11.120 --> 02:12.759
What ... do you two
want some privacy?

02:12.793 --> 02:15.802
I'm gonna find out if he's
my kid today. Let's do this.

Okay.
Okay, now it's Mario's turn.

02:32.017 --> 02:35.792
You're not a Mario.
He looks just like you, Tommy.

02:35.828 --> 02:38.133
We should name him T.J., for "Tommy Jr."

It's weird that
she's so good with babies.

02:43.349 --> 02:47.493
Yeah. It is a little surprising.
Wasn't it wonderful

Don't repeat this 'cause I'll deny it,

02:58.859 --> 03:01.498

so we could keep him.

03:01.532 --> 03:05.442
- Maybe me and Lydia could share him.
- No, Lydia abandoned him.

03:05.476 --> 03:07.514
Well, technically,
she didn't abandon him.

03:07.548 --> 03:10.622
- She left him with family.
- Which is why I can't arrest her.

is leave him with family.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.397
They lay their eggs
in a host bird's nest,

08:43.432 --> 08:45.866
and then they let that
bird raise the babies.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.301
However, they first destroy
the host bird's eggs.

08:48.336 --> 08:52.172
So, all we'll need to do is sneak
into some nice family's home,

08:52.206 --> 08:55.341
drop off T.J., and get
rid of the other kids.

- Maybe from a milkshake?

But Ma doesn't serve frozen,

09:37.445 --> 09:41.681
"Frappuccino" is a portmanteau
of "frappé" and "cappuccino."

you'll sound pretentious?

levels of warfarin in his blood.

10:09.872 --> 10:12.306
- What's warfarin?
- An anticoagulant.

10:12.341 --> 10:15.175
Which Mr. Taylor's medical records
indicate that he wasn't taking.

10:15.210 --> 10:19.045
- Warfarin is also used in rat poison.
- When's the last time

10:19.079 --> 10:21.380
We had someone commit
suicide by rat poison?

10:21.415 --> 10:23.048
Never.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.383
Well, I think we have
ourselves a homicide.

10:27.987 --> 10:30.722
- Maura: Start in the kitchen firSt.
- Susie: Okay.

10:30.756 --> 10:32.256
Oh. Where do you think you're going?

10:32.290 --> 10:33.257
So, you weren't actually
having a heart attack, huh?

10:33.291 --> 10:36.392
- It was gas pains.
- Sorry to disappoint you.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.278
Okay, this is now a crime
scene, so I need the both

10:39.279 --> 10:42.130
of you out of the café so we
can collect evidence, please.

10:42.164 --> 10:44.732
- Was he murdered?
- He was poisoned.

10:44.767 --> 10:45.967
Ohh, how awful!

10:46.001 --> 10:48.934
I found this on a food-prep counter.

10:48.969 --> 10:52.746
So? Where
there's food, there's rats!

10:52.780 --> 10:53.880
It contains warfarin.

10:53.915 --> 10:57.749
Okay, that's rat poison, Stanley,
and that's what killed your customer.

10:57.784 --> 10:59.952
So if any of that ended up in his food,

10:59.986 --> 11:01.153
you'll be charged with
negligent homicide.

11:01.187 --> 11:02.387
Let's go.

11:02.422 --> 11:04.857
No, I'm an innocent
man, unjustly accused!

11:04.891 --> 11:06.392
And I need a statement.
One from you, too, Ma.

11:06.426 --> 11:09.227
You're not under arrest, so
sergeant Korsak will take yours.

11:09.262 --> 11:12.030
- Let's go.
- I have the right to remain silent!

11:12.097 --> 11:14.298
Anything I say can and
will be used against me.

11:14.332 --> 11:17.268
<i>Yeah, keep talking, Stanley.
I love a reason to arrest you.</i>

11:21.422 --> 11:25.124
- You'll be hearing from my lawyer!
- Okay. Nice talking to you, too.

11:25.159 --> 11:27.993
<i>You think this is the end
of this abusive use of power,</i>

11:28.028 --> 11:30.061
<i>you got another think coming, Rizzoli!</i>

11:30.095 --> 11:31.431
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:31.465 --> 11:33.466
I thought he was gonna
start shouting "Attica!"

11:33.501 --> 11:35.201
[ chuckles ]
Sure does a lot of protesting

11:35.269 --> 11:37.938
for a guy who knows nothing
about a missing breakfaSt.

11:37.972 --> 11:40.473
Mm-hmm. Okay, so, what do
we know about our victim?

11:40.507 --> 11:43.709
- He was single, he lived alone.
- But he had a son?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.211
No. According to his
family, that's not his kid.

11:46.246 --> 11:48.947
They don't know who it is or why
his photo was in Phil's wallet.

11:48.981 --> 11:50.315
Well, that's weird.

11:50.349 --> 11:52.216
Victim was a big
pharmaceutical executive.

11:52.251 --> 11:53.985
Lost his job five years ago.

11:54.019 --> 11:56.354
Was doing temp work for
a pharmaceutical distributor.

11:56.388 --> 11:58.689
And you have no idea why
he had your number, Korsak?

11:58.723 --> 11:59.990
Nope.

12:00.024 --> 12:01.525
Notepaper was from St. Avitus.

12:01.559 --> 12:03.559
They have an A.A.
meeting almost every day.

12:03.594 --> 12:05.528
There was one at 6:00 A.M.
this morning.

12:05.562 --> 12:08.263
Well, that's right nearby.
Maybe he came in early

12:08.298 --> 12:09.597
and had breakfast
while he waited for you.

12:09.632 --> 12:13.198
- Jane, can I talk to you?
- Yeah.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.966
Hey, Frost, come on.
Let's go check out St. Avitus.

12:16.000 --> 12:20.236
- What's the matter?
- [ sighs ] Lydia took the baby.

12:21.472 --> 12:23.172
<i>Hi. My name's Larry.
I'm an alcoholic.</i>

12:23.206 --> 12:24.507
<i>Hi, Larry. Hi, Larry.</i>

12:24.541 --> 12:26.375
<i>I spent so many nights
in the drunk tank,</i>

12:26.409 --> 12:29.511
<i>I thought I'd save some
money and get my law degree.</i>

12:29.545 --> 12:33.348
<i>It turned my life around.
Now I'm "Larry the cadillac lawyer."</i>

12:33.382 --> 12:34.982
[ laughter ]

12:35.017 --> 12:37.118
<i>Got my office in the trunk of my car.</i>

12:37.152 --> 12:39.519
<i>So, if you slip and fall,
you can come and find me ... </i>

12:39.554 --> 12:42.722
<i>and my caddie.
Thanks for letting me share.</i>

12:44.358 --> 12:47.626
- Five-minute coffee break, okay?
- Recognize anyone?

12:47.660 --> 12:50.628
She looks familiar, but...
I can't place her.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.531
Vince!

12:57.034 --> 12:58.234
Great seeing you, too.

12:58.269 --> 13:02.272
Oh, come on, Vinnie.
You really don't recognize me?

13:02.306 --> 13:05.508
- I... know we know each other.
- We did.

13:07.778 --> 13:10.345
Oh, god.
[ chuckles ]

13:10.380 --> 13:12.247
Oh.

13:14.283 --> 13:17.418
Detective Frost,
this is my first wife, Dana.

13:17.452 --> 13:20.021
- How do you do?
- Oh, hi. Wow.

13:20.055 --> 13:21.555
Uh, how do you forget your wife?

13:21.589 --> 13:24.091
Oh, it's okay. It's been a while.

13:24.125 --> 13:25.358
40 years.

13:25.393 --> 13:27.026
And we were only
married for three weeks.

13:27.060 --> 13:29.761
Well, it was a year, actually,
but I spent most of it in Vietnam.

13:29.795 --> 13:31.295
I still owe you an apology.

13:31.330 --> 13:32.730
Pfft.

13:32.764 --> 13:35.699
No need. It was so long ago.

13:35.733 --> 13:38.602
Dana, we need your help.

13:39.670 --> 13:42.705
Phil.
Is he in trouble?

13:42.740 --> 13:44.273
He's dead.

13:49.446 --> 13:52.383
- How?
- We don't know yet.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.451
He was just here this morning.

13:54.485 --> 13:56.586
He comes here almost every day.

13:56.621 --> 13:58.219
My name and number were in his wallet.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.689
- Did you give them to him?
- Yes.

14:01.624 --> 14:03.358
I talk about you sometimes.

14:05.495 --> 14:07.062
Let it go, Dana. I have.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.730
Why did you give him my number?

14:08.764 --> 14:12.533
He said he needed a cop he could
trust. But he didn't say why.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.701
Do you know who this is?

14:16.337 --> 14:21.708
- I have no idea. No.
- Was Phil close with anyone here?

14:21.742 --> 14:25.611
No. Not really.
Oh, wait. Wait.

14:25.645 --> 14:27.446
He had just started
hanging out with a woman.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.448
- I don't know her name.
- Can you give us a description?

14:30.483 --> 14:35.187
Mm, 40s, blond...
tall, thin, unhappy.

14:35.221 --> 14:40.492
- That's really all I know.
- Thanks.

14:42.628 --> 14:46.165
- Good to see you.
- You too.

14:46.200 --> 14:51.237
Oh, yeah, really good.
Hey, what was your name, again?

14:54.408 --> 14:58.110
No, I understand.
Thanks for your help, Dan.

14:58.145 --> 15:01.647
Okay. That was the A.D.A.
It's what I thought ...

15:01.681 --> 15:03.648
As his mother, Lydia has a legal claim.

15:03.682 --> 15:06.216
- She holds all the cards.
- What about Tommy?

15:06.251 --> 15:07.818
We didn't get the
paternity test back yet.

15:07.852 --> 15:10.119
A relative can file a motion
for temporary guardianship.

15:10.154 --> 15:11.387
Okay.

15:11.455 --> 15:13.656
But it's a three-month
wait for a hearing.

15:13.690 --> 15:16.825
- Which means T.J. goes into foster care.
- We can't do that to him.

15:16.860 --> 15:19.461
Lydia does seem a bit hapless,
but she doesn't seem evil.

15:19.495 --> 15:21.930
I mean, I don't like her,
but T.J.'s definitely better

15:21.931 --> 15:24.365
off with her than being
bounced around in the system.

15:24.399 --> 15:25.733
[ sighs ]

15:25.801 --> 15:27.468
Frankie, you don't think
she'd hurt him, do you?

15:27.502 --> 15:28.902
No way ... I wouldn't
have let her take him

15:28.937 --> 15:30.304
if I thought something
was gonna happen to him.

15:30.338 --> 15:33.374
Well, what about Lydia's mother?
Lydia said that she doesn't like babies.

15:33.408 --> 15:34.675
Maybe we should try to get him.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.411
What?
You would like to raise T.J.?

15:37.445 --> 15:38.779
Sort of, yeah.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.482
I mean, not full time.
Just... some of the time.

15:43.284 --> 15:44.817
I don't know! We should tell Ma.

15:44.852 --> 15:46.352
Well, Tommy wants to tell her

15:46.387 --> 15:47.454
once he gets the
paternity-test results.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.222
Susie: Stomach-contents results

15:49.256 --> 15:51.391
came back positive for
high levels of warfarin.

15:51.425 --> 15:56.294
Which means that the portal of
entry is the food that he ate.

15:56.329 --> 15:59.164
Okay, so we need to get that food.

15:59.198 --> 16:01.666
Frankie, will you get the CSRU
techs, go through the garbage?

16:01.700 --> 16:04.267
Ma said the victim had
a breakfast special.

16:04.302 --> 16:06.436
You want me to look for his scrambled
eggs and half-eaten pancakes?

16:06.470 --> 16:07.770
Are you kidding me?

16:07.805 --> 16:11.409
- It doesn't look like she is.
- Please?!

16:11.444 --> 16:13.245
[ sighs ]

16:13.280 --> 16:15.280
The culprit could also be the coffee,

16:15.348 --> 16:17.816
although the café doesn't
serve chocolate-mint coffee.

16:17.850 --> 16:20.318
Okay, so put a disposable coffee cup

16:20.352 --> 16:23.687
on your treasure-hunt list.
Thank you!

16:23.721 --> 16:25.789
[ door opens ]

16:25.823 --> 16:27.757
[ door closes ]

16:27.792 --> 16:29.425
Okay, is that why you
moved the bookshelf?

16:29.460 --> 16:31.294
So you could see all
the dead bodies come in?

16:31.328 --> 16:33.761
Yes. Isn't it convenient?

16:36.299 --> 16:38.433
Oh, yes.
I'm forgetting all my troubles.

16:45.871 --> 16:47.872
I'm sorry.
I don't recall your name. 

16:47.906 --> 16:49.473
Alex. Alex Simmons.

16:49.507 --> 16:51.976
I haven't been doing
many shifts lately ...

16:52.010 --> 16:54.378
not since I started medical school.

16:54.412 --> 16:56.079
Wonderful. Congratulations.

16:56.114 --> 16:58.748
Thank you. It's a lot of work, but
it's what I always wanted to do.

17:00.817 --> 17:04.520
Dr. Isles, is that
a Casandra Strickenberg?

17:06.827 --> 17:09.465
Uh, why, yes, it is.
[ chuckles ]

17:09.500 --> 17:11.166
How did you know?

17:11.201 --> 17:13.035
Her giveaway is the trapunto
effect in the appliqués.

17:13.069 --> 17:16.505
Love the hand-stitching.
Such gorgeous fabric.

17:16.539 --> 17:18.440
[ clears throat ]
With an eye like that,

17:18.473 --> 17:20.675
maybe you should've considered
[ chuckling ] fashion design.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.143
Actually, I love to sew.

17:22.178 --> 17:24.512
I'm lucky ...
great fine motor skills.

17:24.546 --> 17:26.446
I also knit, crotchet, and bead.

17:26.481 --> 17:28.449
- Bead?
- Yeah.

17:28.483 --> 17:29.483
Cool.

17:30.985 --> 17:32.619
So, Alex, why don't you
tell us about the victim?

17:32.653 --> 17:35.155
Lucy Cox, 32. Found dead in
her apartment in Dorchester.

17:35.189 --> 17:37.090
No signs of visible trauma.

17:39.026 --> 17:42.161
Bloody mucus. I'll have to do
a gram stain for the sputum.

17:42.195 --> 17:44.096
The paramedics note
how long she was ill?

17:44.130 --> 17:48.032
A week? Neighbor said she was at
home from work with a bad cough.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.867
Significant pleural effusion.

17:52.603 --> 17:56.840
Splinter hemorrhages.
Oh, no.

17:56.874 --> 17:58.908
I'm gonna tell you both
something very frightening,

17:58.943 --> 18:01.177
but I don't want either
of you to panic, all right?

18:01.211 --> 18:03.012
Maura, what is it?

18:03.046 --> 18:04.480
Hold your breath and move as
fast as you can to the crime lab.

18:04.514 --> 18:05.614
We have a code red.

18:05.648 --> 18:07.115
Go now!

18:07.149 --> 18:09.250
[ alarm blaring ]

18:19.826 --> 18:21.794
Come on. I'm asking you
to list the possibilities.

18:21.828 --> 18:24.529
- All right? That's not guessing.
- Jane, try to stay calm.

18:24.563 --> 18:27.231
I am calm.
It's my imagination that's hysterical.

18:27.265 --> 18:30.734
Is it Ebola or Leprosy or
die-before-lunch syndrome?

18:30.768 --> 18:35.805
Ebola is a possibility.
So is Sars, Anthrax, Dengue fever,

18:35.840 --> 18:39.008
west Nile virus,
drug-resistant tuberculosis...

18:41.178 --> 18:43.745
<i>[ muffled ] I'm Captain
Green, incident commander.</i>

18:43.780 --> 18:45.247
<i>I need to know your level
of exposure.</i>

18:45.281 --> 18:47.483
Limited physical contact,
possible aspiration.

<i>Remove your clothing.
Place it in these bags.</i>

18:49.986 --> 18:52.955
<i>Shower with the decontamination soap.</i>

18:52.989 --> 18:55.157
<i>Change into the Tyvek suit.</i>

18:55.191 --> 18:57.625
Ohh. I've only worn this
Casandra Strickenberg once.

18:57.659 --> 19:00.159
- Oh, how awful.
- Yeah, it's a real tragedy.

19:00.194 --> 19:01.761
You need to take
a decontamination shower.

19:01.795 --> 19:02.795
Wh...

19:05.265 --> 19:06.765
Where's the stall?

19:06.799 --> 19:08.967
Well, now is no time to be modest, Jane.

19:09.001 --> 19:12.170
The longer you delay, the more
chance you have of becoming infected.

19:15.173 --> 19:16.773
Well, this is awkward.

19:16.808 --> 19:17.941
[ yawns ]

19:18.943 --> 19:21.510
Sorry. Medical school.

19:21.545 --> 19:23.212
I'm exhausted. It's killing me.

19:26.015 --> 19:28.016
But ...

19:36.959 --> 19:38.159
What?!

19:43.231 --> 19:44.665
[ yawns ]

19:49.905 --> 19:53.007
- You want your Tyvek now?
- Yeah. I can't wait to wear it.

19:53.041 --> 19:55.042
I would also like about a
hundred more of these tiny towels.

19:55.076 --> 19:56.076
[ yawning ] Mm.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.546
Okay.
I am officially offended.

- This is interesting.
- Wha...

<i>What? That Alex fell
asleep while I was naked?</i>

20:11.725 --> 20:13.158
He's obviously not into women.

20:14.728 --> 20:16.161
No, I'm talking to an
official from the CDC.

20:16.195 --> 20:19.831
No reports of any hemorrhagic
viruses anywhere in Massachusetts.

20:19.865 --> 20:21.666
That's great news.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.168
But there's an outbreak of
bacterial meningitis in Boston.

20:24.202 --> 20:25.769
- Is that treatable?
- Yes.

20:25.804 --> 20:28.039
There's a gram stain
test coming back soon.

20:28.073 --> 20:31.008
- Alex! Are you okay?
- I'm fine, babe.

20:31.944 --> 20:33.678
Oh. So he's not into women?

20:33.712 --> 20:35.813
<i>Hello? I'm the one that
has to supervise him.</i>

20:35.848 --> 20:37.982
I did a striptease in
front of my morgue tech.

20:38.016 --> 20:39.817
Oh, no worries.
He wasn't watching.

20:40.886 --> 20:41.986
I didn't know you two were together.

20:42.020 --> 20:45.622
<i>We've been keeping it a secret.
I hope that's okay.</i>

20:45.656 --> 20:47.190
<i>There's no policy in place
about dating coworkers.</i>

20:47.258 --> 20:49.858
[ chuckling ] Oh, yeah, no.
You can shower in front of them.

20:49.893 --> 20:51.126
Frost: You guys okay?

20:51.160 --> 20:55.363
- Maura: We're fine. Thank you.
- Yes, we're fine. Just peachy.

20:55.397 --> 20:57.164
I love being Jane the bubble girl.

20:57.198 --> 20:58.999
Frankie, you didn't tell Ma
about me or the baby, right?

20:59.033 --> 20:59.999
You kidding me?

21:00.034 --> 21:03.002
- Did you find the food?
- No. I'm sorry.

21:03.037 --> 21:04.937
[ sighs ]

21:04.972 --> 21:07.740
Bring me up to speed on the case.

21:07.774 --> 21:09.174
Jane, it can wait.

21:10.310 --> 21:15.380
- Susie, is that the gram stain test?
- It's bacterial meningitis, Dr. Isles.

21:15.414 --> 21:17.048
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Yay?

21:18.917 --> 21:22.184
- You are free to go.
- Yes! Whoo!

21:22.218 --> 21:25.687
Thank you. That's...
far enough.

21:26.722 --> 21:28.189
Thank you.

21:28.223 --> 21:29.890
Captain Green, you didn't
by any chance happen to keep

21:29.958 --> 21:31.858
the Casandra Strickenberg, did you?

21:32.793 --> 21:34.093
My skirt.

21:34.128 --> 21:38.030
Ah. It was just about to be autoclaved.
I stopped them.

21:38.065 --> 21:40.032
Oh, thank you.
[ chuckles ]

21:40.067 --> 21:43.002
- Good job.
- Yes. What a relief.

21:46.239 --> 21:49.240
[ chuckles ]

21:49.275 --> 21:50.975
Welcome back.

21:51.009 --> 21:53.744
You think it's weird for a guy
not to recognize his ex-wife?

21:53.812 --> 21:56.980
- Not if he's had a head injury.
- That explains so many things.

21:57.014 --> 21:59.415
Stop, would you? It's
almost 40 years ago.

21:59.450 --> 22:00.783
She looked different.

22:00.817 --> 22:03.319
Oh! Okay. I get it now.

22:03.353 --> 22:04.653
She doubled in size.

22:04.688 --> 22:07.321
- Where's Detective Cooper?
- The drug unit borrowed her back.

22:07.356 --> 22:11.024
- For how long?
- Mm. A while.

22:11.059 --> 22:12.726
Riley must be bummed.

22:12.760 --> 22:13.760
<i>Angela: Jane!</i>

22:14.695 --> 22:17.330
- I found it.
- You found what?

22:17.365 --> 22:21.666
Okay, you know how Mr. Stanley
has a "no outside drinks" policy?

22:21.701 --> 22:23.735
I have not memorized the
café's penal code, no.

22:23.770 --> 22:26.238
Well, I remembered
the dead man told me

22:26.272 --> 22:29.073
Mr. Stanley made him
throw out his coffee.

22:29.108 --> 22:34.277
And I found his mint-chocolate
fro-cap in the lobby garbage.

22:34.312 --> 22:35.678
Ma, this ... this is great.

22:35.713 --> 22:37.113
[ cellphone vibrates ]
Um...

22:37.147 --> 22:38.180
[ cellphone beeps ]

22:38.214 --> 22:41.081
- Okay, Maura's got something.
- What the heck?

22:43.084 --> 22:44.952
It's Dana. She wants to
talk about Phil's murder.

22:53.156 --> 22:55.257
<i>Dana: I've really been
wrestling with myself. </i>

22:55.292 --> 22:58.795
A.A. works because
everything you say is safe.

22:58.829 --> 23:02.032
- It can't be repeated.
- Dana, Phil Taylor was murdered.

23:02.066 --> 23:04.067
It's possible the killer was someone
he met at one of those meetings.

23:05.536 --> 23:08.738
- Phil said he ruined a life.
- Whose life? Did he say?

23:08.772 --> 23:11.474
A little boy's.
When he shared last night,

23:11.508 --> 23:14.743
he said he was finally ready
for justice to take its course.

23:14.777 --> 23:17.812
Do you think maybe he was coming
here to turn himself in to me?

23:17.846 --> 23:21.883
I don't know.
He was scared.

23:21.917 --> 23:24.152
Dana, exactly what did he say?

23:26.188 --> 23:28.890
He said he had blood on his hands,

23:28.924 --> 23:32.293
that he made another terrible
mistake ... worse than the boy.

23:32.327 --> 23:35.930
He said he couldn't live with
himself until he made it right.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.166
That's all he said.

23:39.201 --> 23:42.136
Any idea how long he'd
been coming to meetings?

23:42.170 --> 23:46.072
- We just gave him his five-year chip.
- Thanks. That helps a lot.

23:47.308 --> 23:48.308
Vince.

23:49.343 --> 23:54.045
I'm really sorry I didn't wait for you.
It's my biggest regret.

23:54.080 --> 23:58.382
A lot of guys got "Dear John" letters.
It's okay, Dana.

23:58.416 --> 23:59.883
I'm glad you got help,
straightened your life out.

24:07.191 --> 24:09.425
It's safe.

24:09.459 --> 24:12.461
It is so clean in here,
you can eat off the tables.

24:12.495 --> 24:14.162
Let's not, Maura.

24:14.196 --> 24:17.164
Bacterial meningitis doesn't
survive its host's death.

24:17.199 --> 24:18.799
Results on the contents
of the coffee cup.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.066
It tested positive for
high levels of warfarin.

24:21.101 --> 24:22.335
Thank you.

24:22.369 --> 24:26.305
- Alex is very nice.
- Yeah, he said the same about you.

24:26.339 --> 24:29.340
He couldn't believe how comfortable
you were being naked around him.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.008
Really? He noticed?

24:31.043 --> 24:33.343
This might be a little too
much information for my boss,

24:33.378 --> 24:35.345
but we met at a nudist retreat.

24:35.380 --> 24:36.880
Oh!

24:36.914 --> 24:38.414
If you want to join us
sometime, that would be...

24:39.349 --> 24:42.318
Well, many illnesses can
be improved with nudity

24:42.353 --> 24:45.154
and some vitamin "D."
Psoriasis, for instance.

24:45.189 --> 24:46.956
- Is there hiking?
- Hiking?

24:46.990 --> 24:48.257
Well, less likely to
contract Lyme disease

24:48.291 --> 24:49.391
if you're not wearing any clothing.

24:50.393 --> 24:52.260
Thank you.
That sounds heavenly, Susie.

24:52.294 --> 24:53.461
We'll let you know.

24:55.196 --> 24:58.199
Really?
Aren't you the one that was worried

24:58.233 --> 25:00.201
about stripping in front
of your morgue tech?

25:00.235 --> 25:03.537
- Well, now that I know he's a nudist...
- Results, please.

25:04.972 --> 25:07.507
The cup tested positive for warfarin.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.943
That is how our victim was poisoned.

25:09.977 --> 25:11.611
Too bad. I was really
hoping to arrest Stanley.

25:11.645 --> 25:13.513
[ chuckles ]
Not today.

25:13.548 --> 25:16.856
Okay, so, Phil guzzles
rat poison in his fro-cap.

25:16.891 --> 25:18.959
I'm guessing he didn't taste it

25:18.994 --> 25:20.461
because of all the
chocolate and the mint?

25:20.495 --> 25:23.396
1,500 calories in a mint fro-cap?

25:23.430 --> 25:25.531
No wonder he has so much adipose tissue.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.399
[ computer beeps ]

25:27.433 --> 25:33.471
50 Boston Joes in the city.
Which one sold him his fro-cap?

25:33.505 --> 25:35.406
Phil must have been talking about this boy.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.308
Why else would he have
this photo in his wallet?

25:38.376 --> 25:41.144
Well, he started going
to A.A. five years ago.

25:41.178 --> 25:43.412
Right about the time he lost
that big pharmaceutical gig.

25:43.447 --> 25:45.014
Maybe his company knew something.

25:45.048 --> 25:46.882
Frost, did you check
Phil's driving record?

25:46.916 --> 25:48.984
Yeah. It was clean.

25:49.018 --> 25:51.352
Rizzoli: Looks about 8 years old.
Maybe we try

25:51.353 --> 25:53.588
running hit-and-runs
over the last five years.

25:53.622 --> 25:55.222
Look for one that involves a young boy.

25:55.257 --> 26:01.028
Okay.
So, Vince, how'd it go with Dana?

26:01.062 --> 26:02.562
What's that supposed to mean?

26:02.597 --> 26:05.965
- It means, did you remember her?
- Oh. Yeah.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.500
We made love on the
interview-room table.

26:07.534 --> 26:11.170
Why would you put that
image inside my head?

26:11.204 --> 26:13.138
Okay, here we go ...

26:13.173 --> 26:16.443
Hit-and-run five years
ago on Phil's block.

26:16.477 --> 26:19.579
The victim was an 8-year-old
boy ... Jimmy Flores.

26:19.614 --> 26:22.315
- Look at the newspaper photo.
- Mm-hmm.

26:22.350 --> 26:25.151
- What happened to Jimmy?
- He was paralyzed.

26:25.186 --> 26:28.052
Was Phil ever a person of
interest in the hit-and-run?

26:28.087 --> 26:30.055
Pulling up the police report.

26:30.089 --> 26:33.525
Police interviewed Phil once.
Says his lawyer was with him.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.427
Lawyer told police
Phil's car was stolen.

your apartment after work.

Frankie, we're in the
middle of a homicide.

26:46.304 --> 26:49.206
Fine.
Then don't blame me

26:49.241 --> 26:51.409
when you're investigating
Tommys homicide tomorrow.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.543
You probably should go.

26:52.577 --> 26:56.947
Okay. I will be there.
Thank you.

26:56.981 --> 26:59.616
So, Phil confesses to
having blood on his hands

26:59.650 --> 27:02.018
and needing to make something right.

27:02.052 --> 27:05.253
And the next day, he's dead.
So, what did he mean?

27:06.656 --> 27:09.690
Let's start with his fro-cap.

27:09.725 --> 27:10.991
[ keyboard clacking ]

right next to St. Avitus.

27:14.629 --> 27:17.964
Go. I'll keep digging.
Take Korsak.

27:17.998 --> 27:21.466
He needs a minty fro-cap
after working up a sweat

27:21.501 --> 27:23.067
with that wife
he couldn't remember.

you were in Vietnam?</i>

27:31.207 --> 27:34.575
- She met somebody.
- Okay, that's terrible.

27:34.643 --> 27:37.377
And I'm glad she doubled in size.
[ chuckles ]

27:37.411 --> 27:39.111
Hi. Can I help you?

27:39.145 --> 27:41.379
Hi. Boston homicide.
Do you recognize this man?

27:41.414 --> 27:43.481
Oh, sure. That's
"five-pump minty extra."

27:44.516 --> 27:46.250
Five pumps with extra chocolate.

27:46.284 --> 27:49.419
- Was he in here early this morning?
- He's here early every day.

27:49.454 --> 27:50.754
Did you see "five-pump" with anyone?

27:50.788 --> 27:53.056
Yeah ... "double-tall,
non-fat, no-foam latte."

27:53.091 --> 27:55.659
[ sighs ] And what does
"double-tall, nonfat" look like?

27:55.694 --> 27:58.062
Tall, skinny blonde.
Sourpuss.

27:58.096 --> 27:59.430
Dana mentioned a woman

27:59.464 --> 28:01.331
that Phil hung out with
at A.A. meetings ...

28:01.366 --> 28:03.000
blond, tall, thin, unhappy.

28:03.034 --> 28:06.202
Yeah, she's always complaining.
Says she can taste caramel in her latte,

28:06.237 --> 28:08.337
so she has me make it again
'cause she doesn't do sugar.

28:08.372 --> 28:10.405
So explain to me why she was
pouring all that sugar in today.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.141
Did she take "five-pump
minty's" drink, too?

28:13.176 --> 28:15.610
I think so.
Excuse me.

28:21.216 --> 28:23.367
I'm guessing that wasn't
sugar that "double-tall"

was pouring into
"five-pump minty's" fro-cap.

28:32.456 --> 28:36.125
- Jane: Ma, I'm so sorry.
- I just don't understand. 

28:36.159 --> 28:39.194
We just can't walk away
from that baby.

28:39.228 --> 28:44.065
- I talked to Lydia.
- Is she gonna share custody?

28:44.099 --> 28:47.500
No, she says she can't forgive
herself for abandoning Mario.

28:47.535 --> 28:49.469
"Mario"?
You named him Mario?

28:49.504 --> 28:53.372
- Ma!
- Lydia named him Thomas Sparks Jr.

28:53.407 --> 28:55.040
"T.J."

28:56.443 --> 29:00.846
- The paternity test came back.
- And?

[ voice breaking ]
He's mine.

29:05.149 --> 29:06.383
[ laughter ]

29:06.417 --> 29:09.819
- Tommy's a baby daddy.
- I-I told you what I did.

29:09.854 --> 29:13.155
I mean, I can't be a father
to him. He almost got killed.

29:13.189 --> 29:16.958
Oh, Tommy.
He rolled off your chest.

29:16.992 --> 29:19.761
- I dropped you once.
- Oh, my god!

29:19.795 --> 29:22.362
- Is that what happened to him?
- What's that supposed to mean?

29:22.397 --> 29:28.433
I was rocking him, and I fell asleep.
You were fine.

29:28.467 --> 29:32.436
You, uh... bumped your lip.
I cried. You cried.

29:32.471 --> 29:34.039
And look ... it's all okay.

29:34.073 --> 29:37.849
Tommy, it's all right, okay?
[ smooches ] We'll all help you.

29:37.884 --> 29:39.284
Yeah. Come on, Tommy.
Man up.

29:39.318 --> 29:40.885
Lydia's mom says
they're coming after you

29:40.919 --> 29:42.120
for child support, anyway.

29:42.154 --> 29:44.189
Well, I'm gonna pay child support.
I'm no deadbeat Dad.

29:44.223 --> 29:45.390
Okay, good.

29:45.424 --> 29:48.159
But I don't have a steady job,
and Lydia and I aren't a couple.

29:48.193 --> 29:52.830
Tommy, we want T.J. in our lives.

29:53.932 --> 29:56.232
- So do I.
- All right.

29:57.167 --> 29:59.168
So you fight for joint custody.

30:01.337 --> 30:06.174
Tommy...
there's another way to do this.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.346
Well, if she says she has
a plan, she has a plan.

30:12.381 --> 30:15.049
Yeah, but I think we all know
about my mother's planning.

30:15.084 --> 30:17.285
That's where Tommy got
his "planning" abilities.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.819
Oh, if it doesn't work out,

30:18.854 --> 30:21.221
you can always use
defense condition one.

30:21.255 --> 30:23.890
Um, I-it's much cooler
if you say "Defcon one."

30:23.924 --> 30:26.626
- Def... Con... One.
- Much cooler.

- Morning, Ma.

- Arrest me.
- What's the charge ...

Felony or misdemeanor
asshole-ish-ness?

30:41.541 --> 30:43.376
- Jane!
- Stay out of this, Rizzoli.

30:43.410 --> 30:46.378
- Felony.
- I need to confess,

30:46.412 --> 30:48.446
and I'd prefer to do it
in the proper surroundings.

30:48.481 --> 30:51.382
Oh, I can't wait to hear
what you have to say.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.118
Yeah, let's go ... upstairs.

30:59.624 --> 31:00.891
That camera better be on,

31:00.925 --> 31:02.626
because I don't want
you twisting my words.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.761
I'm old enough to remember
the Watergate tapes.

31:04.795 --> 31:07.263
Talk. We're in the middle
of a murder investigation.

31:07.297 --> 31:10.433
- I did it!
- You killed Phil Taylor?

31:10.467 --> 31:12.268
I hid key evidence in
a homicide investigation.

31:12.302 --> 31:14.470
I should be punished to
the full extent of the law.

31:14.504 --> 31:17.540
You took the food?
Where is it?

31:17.574 --> 31:18.941
[ sighs ]

31:22.312 --> 31:25.280
- Why did you take it?
- I panicked!

31:25.314 --> 31:26.548
I didn't want the café to
be blamed, so I grabbed it.

31:26.582 --> 31:28.449
And then,
when it became a murder ...

31:28.483 --> 31:30.284
No, this is very serious, Stanley.

31:30.319 --> 31:32.620
I hope you have a very,
very good legal team.

31:32.654 --> 31:33.921
[ sighs ]

31:34.923 --> 31:38.825
Division 1 café was my life's work.
You people are...

31:39.960 --> 31:41.494
You're family.

31:42.362 --> 31:45.929
- No kidding? Family?
- Just like in a real family,

31:45.964 --> 31:47.933
you don't always like
all your relatives.

31:47.967 --> 31:50.002
Yeah, I know exactly what you mean.

31:50.036 --> 31:51.536
God, I wish there was something
we could charge him with.

31:51.571 --> 31:53.905
- What?
- [ sighs ] You're free to go.

31:53.939 --> 31:55.206
- I am?
- Yeah.

31:55.241 --> 31:58.143
Yeah, on one condition.
Two conditions.

31:58.177 --> 32:01.412
You give Mrs. Rizzoli a raise

32:01.446 --> 32:04.747
and you stop calling her
[ as Stanley ] "Rizzoli!"

32:07.119 --> 32:09.487
[ normal voice ]
Hmm? [ sighs ]

32:09.521 --> 32:12.489
<i>Frost: This is from the
doorway into the Boston Joe's.</i>

32:12.524 --> 32:13.557
Okay, that's Phil.

32:13.592 --> 32:17.093
- Yeah, and see the woman?
- Yeah. Who's she?

32:17.128 --> 32:20.029
I'll see what I can do
with facial recognition.

32:20.064 --> 32:21.831
[ computer beeping ]

32:21.865 --> 32:24.067
Okay, I'd like to know what
they're arguing about, too.

32:24.101 --> 32:25.968
No help there. No audio.

32:26.003 --> 32:28.304
[ sighs ]

32:28.338 --> 32:29.939
- Hey, Frankie?
- Yeah?

32:30.007 --> 32:31.006
Come in here.

32:31.041 --> 32:33.842
- Frankie can read lips.
- Really?

32:33.877 --> 32:35.343
Yeah, he spent a lot
of time on the bench

32:35.378 --> 32:37.045
when he started little league...
reading coaches' lips.

32:37.079 --> 32:38.246
I got really good at it.

32:38.280 --> 32:39.480
Got good at benchwarming, too, huh?

32:39.514 --> 32:40.580
[ clears throat ]

32:40.615 --> 32:42.949
- Tell him.
- Tell me what?

32:43.017 --> 32:44.250
- Aw, doesn't matter.
- Yes, it does!

32:44.284 --> 32:46.018
He was an amazing ballplayer,

32:46.052 --> 32:47.520
and he was on his way
to the professionals.

32:47.554 --> 32:50.122
Wow. I'm sorry.

32:50.156 --> 32:51.957
Blew out my arm.
Thrower's elbow.

32:52.025 --> 32:56.528
- So, what do you need?
- Tell us what he's saying.

32:56.562 --> 33:01.198
Uh, okay. He's saying...
"I didn't sign up for this."

33:01.232 --> 33:03.935
- Didn't sign up for what?
- Looks like he's saying...

33:03.969 --> 33:06.170
"I didn't know men in
tights would kill people."

33:06.905 --> 33:10.406
A-mazing.
How does he do it?

33:10.441 --> 33:11.307
Wait. No.

33:13.910 --> 33:16.944
"I didn't know mennonites
would kill people."

33:17.045 --> 33:18.479
Well, there's a mennonite
killer out there.

33:18.513 --> 33:20.113
Not helping, Frost.

33:20.148 --> 33:21.281
[ monitor beeps ]

33:21.315 --> 33:24.517
Whoa. This is.
Got a hit on facial recognition.

33:24.552 --> 33:27.521
Alice Vanderbilt.
Let's go pick her up.

33:30.326 --> 33:34.061
- Frost: Alice has a nice house.
- Korsak: It's in foreclosure.

33:38.300 --> 33:41.536
Jane: Hey, guys.
That's car exhaust.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.306
[ coughing ]

33:46.340 --> 33:48.640
Frost: Engine's running.

33:50.676 --> 33:54.279
I need an ambulance at
1429 Pinecrest Drive.

33:55.281 --> 33:59.150
She's dead.
She's dead.

34:05.219 --> 34:07.386
Cause of death is carbon
monoxide poisoning. 

34:07.420 --> 34:11.554
Okay, Alice's fingerprints were on
the car keys, the hose, the doors.

34:11.590 --> 34:13.857
- It's a suicide, isn't it?
- Yes.

34:13.891 --> 34:15.592
All right, so maybe we're
looking at a murder-suicide.

34:15.627 --> 34:18.295
Phil and Alice, they hook up at A.A.

34:18.329 --> 34:20.563
Phil dumps her.
She kills him.

34:22.599 --> 34:24.199
- Hello, Alex.
- Alex: Dr. Isles.

34:24.234 --> 34:26.568
Hey, Susie said you
mighbe joining us camping.

34:26.603 --> 34:30.938
Huh? No. I can't.
My skin burns so easily.

34:31.007 --> 34:34.509
It does not.
So, Alex, what do we have here?

34:34.543 --> 34:37.245
Victim ... Brian Radcliff, 31.

34:37.279 --> 34:40.181
I think it might be another
case of bacterial meningitis.

34:41.483 --> 34:43.117
I think you might be right.

34:43.152 --> 34:45.918
The CDC is reporting more
cases of meningitis in Boston.

34:45.954 --> 34:47.554
Meningitis. Oh, my god.

34:47.588 --> 34:51.223
<i>Frankie wasn't saying
"men in tights" or "mennonites."</i>

34:51.257 --> 34:54.192
Jane?
Jane?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.263
Jane: Right there.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.331
He's saying, "I didn't know
meningitis would kill people."

35:00.365 --> 35:02.266
That's why he wanted to talk to me.

35:02.300 --> 35:05.435
I'm still not getting how
the mennonites in tights

35:05.469 --> 35:07.069
killed the people with meningitis ...

35:07.104 --> 35:08.604
Or what that has to do
with you, Korsak.

35:08.638 --> 35:11.936
- Yeah, me either.
- You got me. Let's go through it again.

35:11.971 --> 35:14.272
Phil Taylor was a big
pharmaceutical executive,

35:14.306 --> 35:17.175
gets fired, takes a crap job
distributing pharmaceuticals.

35:17.209 --> 35:19.544
Alice Vanderbilt was
a quality-control lab tech

35:19.578 --> 35:21.512
at Rampvex pharmaceutical industries.

35:21.546 --> 35:23.413
Alice had an M.D.?

35:23.448 --> 35:24.882
May that's how she was able
to afford that nice house.

35:24.916 --> 35:26.383
That's in foreclosure.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.552
Her bio says she was
a successful anesthesiologist

35:28.586 --> 35:31.955
- before she closed her practice.
- To become a lab tech?

35:31.989 --> 35:35.556
What did Alice do?
Is her medical license still current?

35:35.591 --> 35:37.124
[ keyboard clacking ]

35:40.361 --> 35:42.428
No. She hasn't
renewed it since 2009.

35:42.463 --> 35:45.531
But she keeps an open
application on file.

35:45.566 --> 35:49.201
Okay. Did our two
victims with meningitis

35:49.235 --> 35:51.002
have any connection to each other?

35:51.036 --> 35:54.171
Both were young professionals
who worked in the financial district.

35:55.206 --> 35:57.507
I found a needle-puncture
wound with a contusion

35:57.575 --> 36:00.542
on the right bicep of the
man who died of meningitis.

36:00.577 --> 36:03.044
So you're saying he
was injected? With what?

36:03.079 --> 36:04.946
A flu vaccine.

36:06.648 --> 36:08.915
Okay, wait a minute.
This is starting to make sense.

36:08.950 --> 36:11.451
Does Rampvex manufacture
flu vaccines?

36:11.485 --> 36:12.952
Yeah.

36:12.986 --> 36:15.155
So, maybe Alice contaminated
the flu vaccines.

36:15.190 --> 36:16.994
And Phil distributed them.

36:17.029 --> 36:19.930
But why would you infect people with
bacterial meningitis? It's treatable.

36:19.965 --> 36:22.566
Same reason somebody tainted
tylenol ... create fear?

36:22.600 --> 36:24.267
No, I don't think so.

36:24.301 --> 36:26.202
Maura, why would two healthy,
young professionals die

36:26.237 --> 36:27.937
if it's a treatable illness?

36:27.972 --> 36:30.240
Well, they only died because
they had underlying problems ...

36:30.274 --> 36:31.541
compromised immune systems.

36:31.575 --> 36:33.576
Otherwise, it would've
just made them very ill.

36:33.610 --> 36:36.011
Pain and suffering ...
plus, they can't work,

36:36.045 --> 36:37.479
all because of a bad flu vaccine?

36:37.513 --> 36:40.281
And Rampvex, the
manufacturer, has deep pockets?

36:40.315 --> 36:41.649
But who's gonna sue?

36:41.683 --> 36:43.417
Neither of our two dead
victims were married.

36:43.452 --> 36:47.521
Oh, you're worth a lot more ill or gravely
injured than dead when you're single.

36:47.555 --> 36:50.190
So, Phil and Alice created
their own class-action lawsuit.

36:50.225 --> 36:53.010
But they were the bad guys.
They couldn't file the lawsuit.

36:53.327 --> 36:56.963
They could if they had one
more partner ... a lawyer.

36:56.997 --> 36:59.465
Hey, Frost, is Phil's lawyer's
name in the hit-and-run report?

36:59.499 --> 37:01.233
[ keyboard clacking ]

37:01.268 --> 37:02.335
No.

37:03.670 --> 37:06.705
But Alice's medical-license
application lists her lawyer.

them the truth, Larry?

37:24.155 --> 37:27.224
- You came here to troll for clients.
- Hey, I'm in the middle of my share.

37:27.258 --> 37:28.558
What is going on?

37:28.593 --> 37:30.160
Larry here isn't actually an alcoholic.

37:30.194 --> 37:31.527
He just likes taking
advantage of people who are

37:31.562 --> 37:34.464
- trying to maketheir lives better.
- What the hell?

37:34.498 --> 37:36.532
You met Phil and Alice here
and came up with a great scheme.

37:36.566 --> 37:38.534
Hand over the keys to
that big cadillac outside.

37:38.569 --> 37:40.269
We need to have a look at your "office."

- Let me see a warrant.
- Let me see the keys.

- Hey, those are private mementos.

37:55.184 --> 37:58.486
Yeah. Helped two young, innocent
people into an early grave.

37:58.520 --> 38:00.421
Let's see what's in Phil's file.

38:00.455 --> 38:02.189
Huh.

38:02.223 --> 38:05.225
You think that's from the
night he ran over Jimmy Flores?

38:05.259 --> 38:07.027
Oh, you are sentimental.

38:07.061 --> 38:09.562
You kept the license plate
from Phil's "stolen" car.

38:09.596 --> 38:12.265
What mementos
did you save from Alice?

38:12.299 --> 38:14.066
No, he handled Alice's malpractice suit

38:14.100 --> 38:16.134
after her drinking killed
a few of her patients.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.436
Hey, I was trying to help my
clients. They were desperate.

38:18.470 --> 38:20.404
Yeah, desperate to get
their livelihoods back.

38:20.438 --> 38:22.172
Too bad your scheme
went a little haywire

38:22.207 --> 38:24.308
when you and Alice realized
Phil had a conscience.

38:24.342 --> 38:26.343
Yeah, Alice had one, too...
she killed herself

38:26.377 --> 38:28.812
when people started dying
from your tainted vaccine.

38:28.846 --> 38:31.381
This looks like the lot
number for the bad vaccine.

38:31.415 --> 38:36.286

lawyers keep such tidy records.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.421

make sure they seize them.

bad with Lydia, did I?

This baby provides us an
opportunity to, uh... start new.

- Can we get you something to drink?

you a prescription.

Can you believe it?
All because of this little guy.

go to the bathroom or anything,

at Thanksgiving and
Christmas and New Year's.

T.J.'s gonna be a Red Sox fan.

Oh, I'd like to teach him how to fence.

41:24.668 --> 41:27.269
If you do, I will teach him
how to sew and knit and bead.

41:27.303 --> 41:28.603
Really? 
I want to take classes with you.

41:28.638 --> 41:30.905
- Stop.
- What? It'd be so fun.

41:30.940 --> 41:32.540
Can we please just
get through this meal?

41:35.643 --> 41:37.210
Who's hungry?

41:37.245 --> 41:39.479
<i>Rene: I don't like spicy.</i>
