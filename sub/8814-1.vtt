WEBVTT

00:38.329 --> 00:42.750
I'll tell you, Carol, it's quite a sight
up here. All those stars, the blue water.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.002
Reminds me of that night in Cabo.
Remember?

00:45.170 --> 00:46.336
Hal, stay on the flight.

00:46.504 --> 00:47.963
A lot of sangria that night.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.299
- Boy, could you put it away.
- Hal.

00:50.467 --> 00:54.470
- I don't know how we made it to the hotel...
- Hal, you're at 91,400 feet.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.473
Ten feet higher, the window cracks
and you're tapioca.

00:57.640 --> 01:00.642
Just pushing it a little.
Maybe we'll set a record for the company.

01:00.810 --> 01:05.313
Please, Hal. For once in your life,
no stunts, no surprises.

01:07.150 --> 01:09.526
No surprises.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.116
Find him.

01:58.952 --> 02:01.870
Make this landing and we'll have
a perfect flight, Mr. Jordan.

02:02.038 --> 02:05.707
So does this mean I get a gold star,
or just an incredible simulation?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.312
What happened to the power?

02:27.689 --> 02:29.231
Hello?

02:29.440 --> 02:31.900
Carol? Anybody?

02:32.235 --> 02:34.903
If I have to fly
this freaking park ride again....

02:44.247 --> 02:46.248
Okay.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.888
My God.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.393
No.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.520
It's all right.

03:08.855 --> 03:10.522
My time has come.

03:10.690 --> 03:11.773
You speak English.

03:11.941 --> 03:13.650
No.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.028
It's the ring.

03:17.947 --> 03:21.033
It has chosen you. Take it.

03:52.941 --> 03:56.944
You are now a Green Lantern...

03:57.111 --> 04:00.239
one of the protectors of the universe.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.992
The Guardians will send for you.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.286
Use...

04:06.454 --> 04:08.288
the ring...

04:08.498 --> 04:10.666
wisely.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.529
What the hell?

06:50.493 --> 06:53.745
And when that weird
glow cleared, the simulator was...

07:24.569 --> 07:26.194
Was there an earthquake?

07:31.200 --> 07:34.369
I guess it's okay,
but a whole week?

07:34.537 --> 07:35.662
Where are you going?

07:35.830 --> 07:39.040
I don't know. I thought I'd do
some exploring. See some new sights.

07:39.208 --> 07:41.793
Not much else to do
until we get word on the prototype.

07:41.961 --> 07:45.046
Well, at least the simulator
wasn't damaged too badly.

07:45.214 --> 07:47.382
Hey, Carol, gotta run.
I'll call you from...

07:47.550 --> 07:49.092
wherever.

08:04.484 --> 08:05.734
So it's true.

08:05.902 --> 08:08.236
Abin Sur really is dead.

08:09.572 --> 08:10.739
Where is his body?

08:12.408 --> 08:15.535
- I said, where is...?
- It was blown up with the spacecraft.

08:16.662 --> 08:17.746
I want it off.

08:18.414 --> 08:19.748
Hey!

08:20.208 --> 08:22.042
The poozer's not even trained.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.846
Someone's been practicing.

08:35.722 --> 08:37.432
And without a manual.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.559
Let's all power down for a moment,
shall we?

08:41.479 --> 08:44.773
I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.108
My name is Sinestro.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.444
This is Boodikka, Tomar Re...

08:49.612 --> 08:53.198
- and you've met our charming Kilowog.
- Heh.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.118
- And you?
- Hal Jordan.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.954
Well, Hal Jordan...

08:59.121 --> 09:01.623
we are members
of the Green Lantern Corps...

09:01.791 --> 09:04.960
an elite, intergalactic force
from the planet Oa.

09:05.127 --> 09:08.922
Our superiors are a group of immortals
known as the Guardians.

09:09.090 --> 09:12.008
- Yeah. They're supposed to send for me.
- That's right.

09:12.176 --> 09:14.427
We're to bring you back for a little chat.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.304
And in case you're wondering...

09:16.472 --> 09:18.557
this is not a request.

09:18.933 --> 09:21.560
The ring isn't yours
until the Guardians have decided.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.020
- Okay.
- Very good.

09:24.188 --> 09:26.565
Tomar, would you do the honors?

09:48.879 --> 09:52.841
We thought the trip might be easier for you
in a more earthly construct.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.137
Uh, thanks.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.795
You must understand, earthling...

10:30.963 --> 10:34.382
the Green Lantern Corps
is a privileged organization.

10:34.550 --> 10:36.509
Not just anyone can join.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.678
There are tremendous commitments.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.889
Each Lantern is responsible...

10:41.057 --> 10:45.393
for patrolling one of 3600 sectors
of the universe.

10:45.561 --> 10:47.479
- But...
- Sort of like one cop per precinct.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.398
Uh, yes. I... I suppose.

10:50.566 --> 10:52.484
My uncle was a cop.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.362
- Yes, but...
- Thirty years on the Coast City police force.

10:55.529 --> 10:58.031
He used to let me
turn on the siren. Nice guy.

10:59.116 --> 11:04.120
But more than that,
the Green Lantern ring is a complex tool.

11:04.288 --> 11:07.374
It takes someone
with fierce concentration.

11:07.541 --> 11:08.917
I think I got the hang of it.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.336
He's got the hang of it.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.545
Ranakar.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.840
Why are we even entertaining this?
He's a human.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.426
Yes, hard to get past that.

11:19.512 --> 11:23.598
I'm afraid the human race of Earth
does not have the most stellar reputation.

11:25.685 --> 11:31.356
The fact is humans are crude,
base, fearful and untrustworthy.

11:31.524 --> 11:32.691
Then there's the smell.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.778
You can't condemn an entire species.

11:36.946 --> 11:38.530
You've said it yourself, Ganthet.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.907
It's a wonder they've lasted this long.

11:41.075 --> 11:43.618
Maybe you'd like me
to list their atrocities.

11:43.786 --> 11:45.453
Maybe our human can help us.

11:45.621 --> 11:47.622
Maybe he has a few of his own.

11:49.792 --> 11:51.835
Listen, buddy, I didn't ask for this ring.

11:52.002 --> 11:55.463
You want it back, take it,
because I've had enough of this crap.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.969
Well, it appears we can add impertinence
to their many qualities.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.637
The human has a point.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.056
If he were as unworthy
as everyone says...

12:05.224 --> 12:08.685
no power in the galaxy
could have forced that ring on his finger.

12:08.853 --> 12:12.480
Yet there it is, at one with him.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.818
Guardian Council, if I may speak.

12:17.361 --> 12:18.820
Please, Sinestro.

12:18.988 --> 12:22.657
The Lantern of Sector 1417
is recognized.

12:22.825 --> 12:24.451
Thank you, Appa Ali Apsa.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.161
I'd like to make a proposal.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.789
Allow me to take the human
under my wing, test him out...

12:29.957 --> 12:31.332
see what he's made of.

12:31.959 --> 12:33.126
That's my job.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.212
People can surprise you
if you give them a little incentive.

12:36.380 --> 12:39.215
You have more important things
on your agenda, Sinestro.

12:39.383 --> 12:42.010
We have a deepening crisis at hand.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.847
I understand, sir, but I thought
the human could be of assistance.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.891
It's a bit out of the ordinary...

12:48.058 --> 12:50.518
but I'd be interested
in Sinestro's evaluation.

12:50.686 --> 12:52.687
Shall we put it to a vote?

12:52.855 --> 12:55.023
All in favor.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.122
So be it. The human falls
under your command, Sinestro.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.041
Good luck.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.085
I'm the trainer around here.

13:16.253 --> 13:17.962
I know, I know.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.217
- So, what now?
- Now, I own your ass.

13:23.385 --> 13:24.552
Come on.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.312
What's the crisis they were talking about?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.815
A small matter
of who's gonna control the universe.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.484
Not that it's in the best hands as it is.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.739
But first things first.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.408
You are on sacred ground, Earth boy.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.410
We're at the center of the universe.

13:49.578 --> 13:52.914
This lantern contains the battery
that powers all the rings.

13:53.082 --> 13:56.251
It also contains
all the known information of the cosmos.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.799
A sort of atlas
and who's who of space.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.593
We're going to be playing
in Sector 1215.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.428
You need to be brought up to speed.

14:10.933 --> 14:15.770
Stick your ring in the light, think
1215 and the battery will do the rest.

14:38.502 --> 14:40.503
Unbelievable.

14:41.088 --> 14:42.380
This isn't a travelogue.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.992
Not bad.
The last rookie fried his antennas off.

15:11.994 --> 15:13.620
Glad I could impress you.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.288
But you do.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.999
Unlike the others, I like humans.

15:18.167 --> 15:22.128
I admire their spirit
and their natural contempt for authority.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.297
It's well-founded here.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.673
You mean the Guardians?

15:25.841 --> 15:29.510
They were a power at one time,
but now they've grown soft.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.930
They've no idea
what it's like on the front line.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.349
But don't you worry, Earth boy.

15:34.516 --> 15:38.019
They'll be taking notice of you.
I need to know if you've got the stuff...

15:38.187 --> 15:40.021
- for what's ahead.
- What's that?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.775
We're going to get the butcher
who killed Abin Sur.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.536
Cadmendoh is a pustule of a planet.

15:55.704 --> 15:57.830
A breeding ground of criminal scum.

15:58.165 --> 16:01.209
One time I suggested we clean it out
with a meteor shower.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.086
The Guardians thought I was kidding.

16:03.253 --> 16:05.797
- Who we after?
- A squidman named Cuch.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.215
He killed Abin Sur?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.384
With a smile.

16:15.724 --> 16:17.642
I don't have this place in my files.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.102
It's called Labella's.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.396
It changes addresses frequently.

16:27.069 --> 16:28.236
Is he Labella?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.238
He's the bouncer.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.241
Watch my back
and keep your mouth shut.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.413
Aah!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.084
Boolywatt.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.419
Sinestro.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.962
Looks like a busy night.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.755
Any chance Cuch has shown up?

16:47.923 --> 16:49.257
Don't know no Cuch.

16:49.425 --> 16:53.094
Booly, Booly, Booly. Look at you.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.763
Like a big rubber Booly ball.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.266
Bet I could bounce you off the wall.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.687
I... I haven't seen him. I swear!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.939
You know who to come to when you do.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.898
Yeah.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.479
Maybe we should have come undercover.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.731
What's the fun in that?

17:53.489 --> 17:54.822
Labella.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.491
S-man.

17:56.658 --> 17:59.160
You should've let me know
you were coming, baby.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.995
Always surprising me.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.330
Why you do that?

18:02.498 --> 18:04.665
Could've made some cozy time.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.085
I'm in a bit of a hurry, my dear.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.836
I'm looking for Cuch.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.171
Cuch?

18:10.339 --> 18:11.631
Don't ask me.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.091
I'm not his mother.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.509
I heard he was in town.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.011
Cuch left with the bug man, baby.

18:17.304 --> 18:19.305
Long time ago.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.182
Never come back to old Labella.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.434
How come I don't believe you?

18:24.144 --> 18:26.854
How come these suits got no zippers?

18:31.026 --> 18:34.946
Aw, honey, you're not gonna slam Labella
for a little moon ball.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.740
I can't control all the shank
that gets in here.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.367
- Take it.
- What?

18:39.535 --> 18:40.701
A little incentive.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.578
Maybe it will jog your memory.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.413
Go ahead.

18:57.427 --> 18:59.971
You're a bad boy, S-man.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.389
What about Cuch?

19:01.557 --> 19:02.723
I told you.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.894
No.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.813
One more.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.405
Sinestro, come on.

19:17.573 --> 19:20.032
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.037
Honey, I beg you.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.414
Where's Cuch?

19:27.124 --> 19:29.000
I don't know.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.217
End this.

19:38.385 --> 19:40.428
I know what I'm doing.

19:40.762 --> 19:42.930
He always comes back to you after a job.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.265
Please....

19:44.433 --> 19:46.392
And he's here. He's close, isn't he?

19:54.234 --> 19:56.652
Just tell me, Labella.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.453
What do you mean? Where is she?

20:05.621 --> 20:07.622
Labella!

20:09.374 --> 20:11.042
Shoot.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.350
I'm going up.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.626
- It's a fragger!
- Aah!

21:48.223 --> 21:49.557
Aah!

23:23.819 --> 23:25.486
I got lucky.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.987
Unh!

23:27.406 --> 23:28.656
You defied me.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.783
You could've killed her.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.576
Let me tell you, friend.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.954
The only way to operate out here
is by fear.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.580
They hit, I hit harder.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.791
They attack, I annihilate.

23:38.959 --> 23:42.461
I am the one constant, unassailable force
against their chaos...

23:42.629 --> 23:44.463
and you made them forget that.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.007
You think I enjoy this?

23:47.175 --> 23:49.427
Look at the universe
the Guardians have created.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.763
We have the greatest power in the cosmos
and what have they made us?

23:52.931 --> 23:54.390
Garbage collectors!

23:54.558 --> 23:56.308
We pick up the trash.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.477
A thief here, a killer there.

23:58.645 --> 24:01.147
Scum, dirt, filth!

24:01.314 --> 24:04.442
There's no end to it,
but there could be.

24:04.609 --> 24:08.362
It's my dream that one day
all this rot will be wiped away.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.866
A new order will prevail,
one that will end the chaos...

24:12.033 --> 24:14.160
but it won't be built
by the faint of heart.

24:14.327 --> 24:20.499
You got soft on me back there, Earth boy,
and that I will not tolerate.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.712
Everything okay?
We heard there was a disturbance.

24:25.338 --> 24:26.672
We're fine.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.549
Hey, you got Cuchie.

24:28.717 --> 24:30.217
Don't he look peaceful.

24:30.385 --> 24:34.346
I'm taking him to the nearest substation.
I want everyone with me.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.395
- You all right?
- Yeah.

24:41.563 --> 24:42.730
Swell.

24:59.206 --> 25:00.623
Ugh.

25:02.250 --> 25:03.792
Mind if I join you?

25:03.960 --> 25:06.253
Might hurt your reputation.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.424
Give them time.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.092
You have to understand...

25:12.260 --> 25:14.970
Abin Sur, everyone loved him.

25:15.138 --> 25:16.931
He had family, friends.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.350
He was irreplaceable.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.352
Any news on Cuch?

25:21.520 --> 25:24.355
- They took him to interrogation.
- Who's asking the questions?

25:24.523 --> 25:25.731
Who do you think?

25:31.279 --> 25:34.198
- Ouch.
- I know. Sinestro can be difficult.

25:37.077 --> 25:39.411
All right, he can be pretty damn arrogant.

25:39.579 --> 25:43.123
Some of us are starting to worry about him,
but he's under a lot of pressure.

25:43.291 --> 25:46.085
- Yeah, saving the universe or something.
- That's right.

25:46.419 --> 25:47.795
Cuch is just a bit player.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.798
The one we're really after
is his boss, Kanjar Ro.

25:51.299 --> 25:52.466
He's just a warlord.

25:52.634 --> 25:53.676
Not anymore.

25:53.843 --> 25:57.471
- Not since he found the yellow element.
- Should I be taking notes?

25:58.139 --> 26:00.724
This story goes back as far
as time itself...

26:00.892 --> 26:03.310
when the only sentient beings
were the Guardians.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.565
They built the lantern battery...

26:07.732 --> 26:09.817
long before the creation
of the Corps.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.905
The battery would power all the rings
with the green element...

26:15.073 --> 26:17.324
the greatest energy source
in the universe.

26:17.492 --> 26:19.952
Where it comes from
only the Guardians know.

26:20.120 --> 26:23.163
But once it was installed,
the Guardians had the ultimate weapon...

26:23.331 --> 26:26.333
to maintain peace and promote justice
in the galaxies.

26:26.501 --> 26:30.504
Unfortunately, the battery
had one vulnerability, the color yellow.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.632
It's one part of the light spectrum
that can resist the green...

26:33.800 --> 26:36.343
and the most concentrated source
of yellow energy...

26:36.511 --> 26:37.678
is the yellow element.

26:37.846 --> 26:41.974
For eons, the Guardians had it hidden
underground in another dimension...

26:42.934 --> 26:45.436
until Kanjar Ro found out.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.771
When the Guardians
discovered the theft...

26:47.939 --> 26:51.191
they called for an emergency meeting
with the senior Lanterns.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.193
Abin Sur offered to go undercover.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.989
Within days, he had infiltrated
Ro's ship...

26:57.157 --> 26:59.283
but there was no sign
of the yellow element.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.702
Kanjar Ro had taken it somewhere.

27:02.412 --> 27:07.082
Abin Sur was about to report back
to the Guardians when he was found out.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.749
That's the way I heard it.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.043
From there,
Abin Sur made his way to Earth.

27:51.211 --> 27:54.588
- And now you're here.
- Jeez.

27:55.548 --> 27:58.717
- You captured Cuch by yourself.
- He tell you that?

27:58.885 --> 28:01.261
No. I was in your head.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.597
Interesting.

28:04.057 --> 28:06.934
As you know,
Kanjar Ro was forced to abandon his ship...

28:07.102 --> 28:08.894
after Abin Sur's escape.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.312
Now he's on the move again.

28:10.480 --> 28:11.855
I just found out from Cuch...

28:12.023 --> 28:15.984
that Ro and his men are meeting at
the Kadian Space Terminal at 1700 hours.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.778
That's it? That's all you got?

28:20.782 --> 28:22.157
Not that it isn't significant.

28:22.325 --> 28:26.078
No. It's good to know.
Needed. Necessary even.

28:27.247 --> 28:30.124
I want everyone back here
at 1600 hours.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.626
We'll leave together.
Are there any questions?

28:32.794 --> 28:33.794
If not, then...

28:40.218 --> 28:42.302
Excuse me.

28:45.515 --> 28:49.601
This is not the first time
we've had to reprimand you, Sinestro.

28:49.769 --> 28:52.438
This cruelty is hardly the Guardian way.

28:52.605 --> 28:53.647
He was resistant.

28:53.815 --> 28:55.274
It made the process difficult.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.818
- I did my best.
- We should have been called.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.779
We might have been able
to use our telepathy to draw him out.

29:00.947 --> 29:02.239
Time is running out.

29:02.407 --> 29:05.325
And we're facing a foe
who is hell-bent on destroying us.

29:05.493 --> 29:08.120
The Green Lantern Corps
is an ideal, Sinestro.

29:08.288 --> 29:11.415
You don't save it
by ignoring what it stands for.

29:11.583 --> 29:14.334
This must not happen to Kanjar Ro.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.588
The moment he is captured,
he is to be brought to us.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.256
We'll do the questioning.

29:19.424 --> 29:21.133
Is that understood?

29:21.301 --> 29:22.801
Yes, sir.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.309
They will doom us all.

29:52.123 --> 29:54.792
I'll need someone
to watch this outer perimeter. Ch'p?

29:54.959 --> 29:56.251
I always get the stink jobs.

29:56.419 --> 29:58.378
- Let the new guy do it.
- Whatever.

29:58.546 --> 30:00.464
Fine. Let's go.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.718
Don't trip over the luggage.

30:17.899 --> 30:19.399
Attention, travelers.

30:19.567 --> 30:22.069
We apologize
for this interruption in service.

30:22.237 --> 30:26.114
The Green Lantern Corps has requested
a routine scan of the spaceport.

30:26.282 --> 30:31.245
There is nothing to be concerned about.
Operations will resume momentarily.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.923
That red-faced swine
wants to flush me out.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.967
What should we do?

30:46.302 --> 30:47.928
Leave.

30:50.014 --> 30:51.598
The room. Get out.

30:53.726 --> 30:55.978
I'll let you know when I'm done.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.119
I am here.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.288
Make yourself present.

31:15.164 --> 31:17.583
Sinestro, I'm calling.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.043
Make your presence known.

31:27.302 --> 31:28.427
I'm here.

31:28.928 --> 31:32.389
- What kind of stunt are you trying to pull?
- You're a hard man to reach.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.266
What do you want, a daily briefing?

31:34.434 --> 31:37.936
It's dangerous to talk, even like this,
especially with Abin Sur dead.

31:38.104 --> 31:41.106
Communication, Ro. It goes two ways.

31:41.274 --> 31:43.150
I swear I'm not squeezing you out.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.652
- Where's the yellow element?
- With the Weaponers.

31:45.820 --> 31:48.280
The weapon is ready for pickup.
We don't have long.

31:48.448 --> 31:49.990
- Where?
- I'm gonna tell you...

31:50.158 --> 31:51.658
surrounded by your pack dogs?

31:51.826 --> 31:53.493
Don't try me, Ro.

31:53.661 --> 31:57.831
I've put everything on the line for this:
the Corps, the future, my life.

31:57.999 --> 32:00.083
I am not going
to be given the runaround.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.420
Tell you what, we go to the Weaponers
together, just you and me.

32:03.588 --> 32:05.923
You get rid of your boys,
I'll get rid of mine.

32:06.090 --> 32:08.133
- Where are you?
- In a waiting room.

32:08.301 --> 32:12.012
I'll meet you at Station 50 in half an
hour. But if I see one ring anywhere...

32:12.180 --> 32:13.805
Just be there.

32:17.518 --> 32:20.520
Tomar, we have a change of plans.

32:23.024 --> 32:24.191
Come on. We're leaving.

32:24.609 --> 32:25.651
But the rings...

32:25.818 --> 32:27.861
Use your faders.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.166
Jordan?

32:41.334 --> 32:43.877
- Tell me you got him.
- Not yet. How are you doing?

32:44.045 --> 32:47.714
So far I've seen 10 shooting stars,
one supernova and a baggage handler.

32:47.882 --> 32:51.218
Tomar says Sinestro wants
to re-deploy most of us to the next port.

32:52.804 --> 32:56.390
Get over to the south perimeter.
Tomar is meeting us there.

32:56.724 --> 32:58.183
Uh-huh.

33:01.688 --> 33:03.188
You okay?

33:03.398 --> 33:06.149
Yeah. Something hit me.

33:09.404 --> 33:11.154
Stay here.

33:46.274 --> 33:47.524
Hold it, bug boy.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.476
- Aah!
- Aah!

34:43.831 --> 34:46.291
Jordan, where are you?

34:46.458 --> 34:48.335
Got a little pest-control problem.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.109
Where is Kanjar Ro?

35:13.069 --> 35:15.445
Sinestro. He's heading for the west gates.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.781
Do whatever it takes. I need him alive.

35:27.416 --> 35:29.084
Rings!

36:48.456 --> 36:50.457
- Nice move.
- Hm.

36:55.630 --> 36:57.714
All right, one at a time.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.052
What are you doing? Where's Ro?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.971
- Sinestro, these people...
- These people are irrelevant.

37:05.139 --> 37:07.641
The Corps is on the line.
Get that through your heads.

37:07.808 --> 37:10.310
None of us,
and therefore none of them are safe...

37:10.478 --> 37:11.811
until we get Kanjar Ro.

37:11.979 --> 37:15.815
I don't care if we have to tear
this place apart girder by girder.

37:22.156 --> 37:23.448
It's him.

37:24.659 --> 37:27.035
- Unh. Ooh!
- Ugh!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.293
Push it.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.880
- Huh? Yeah.
- You all right?

38:32.393 --> 38:34.019
Good shot.

38:34.186 --> 38:37.897
- They're going to reach us.
- Time to lighten the load.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.871
Holy crap!

38:56.250 --> 38:58.001
We have to get through.

39:05.926 --> 39:08.553
There's a rift ahead.
We can get out home free.

39:28.699 --> 39:30.116
It's that guy from the port.

39:30.284 --> 39:33.244
So why are you sitting here?

40:54.994 --> 40:56.161
Unh!

41:18.517 --> 41:19.517
Ugh.

41:21.770 --> 41:23.813
One bug left.

41:54.261 --> 41:56.429
I'd power down if I were you.

41:58.516 --> 42:01.100
I'm the only one who knows
where the Weaponers are.

42:01.268 --> 42:03.436
Without me, you'll never find them.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.360
Take me in, and I'll implicate you,
I swear.

42:13.197 --> 42:17.534
Come on, Sinestro. Put the ring down.
We can still work this out.

42:21.247 --> 42:23.748
- Sinestro?
- I'm thinking.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.416
What's there to think about?

42:25.584 --> 42:27.377
Plan B. It could work.

42:34.802 --> 42:35.969
Sinestro.

42:36.136 --> 42:37.929
Yes.

42:49.441 --> 42:50.942
Down here.

43:01.745 --> 43:04.664
You entered the pilot's cabin on your own.

43:04.832 --> 43:05.832
Yes, sir.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.168
- And you did not see Kanjar Ro?
- No, sir.

43:09.336 --> 43:11.796
And you have no recollection
of killing him?

43:11.964 --> 43:13.172
I did not kill him.

43:13.340 --> 43:15.842
Someone did,
and he wore a Green Lantern ring.

43:16.635 --> 43:18.219
You were the first ones there.

43:18.387 --> 43:21.598
Actually, Tomar Re and Boodikka
arrived on the scene first...

43:21.765 --> 43:23.349
but I was there soon after.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.643
We followed the ship's
vapor trail separately.

43:25.811 --> 43:27.979
- And no one else was on the ship?
- No.

43:28.147 --> 43:30.690
But I think it's perfectly understandable
what happened.

43:30.858 --> 43:33.151
The human was attacked by Kanjar Ro...

43:33.319 --> 43:36.696
and in his last moments of
consciousness, he struck back.

43:36.864 --> 43:38.990
A clear case of self-defense.

43:39.158 --> 43:41.618
He should never have put himself
in that situation.

43:41.785 --> 43:43.328
If he hadn't played hero...

43:43.495 --> 43:46.831
you might have caught up with the ship
and taken Kanjar Ro alive.

43:46.999 --> 43:50.418
Now there's no telling into whose hands
the yellow element might fall.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.337
Perhaps you'd like to say something?

43:52.504 --> 43:54.339
I didn't kill him.

43:54.506 --> 43:55.715
Then who did?

43:55.883 --> 43:58.801
Whoever took his Energi-Rod.
I sure as hell don't have it.

43:58.969 --> 44:00.428
By your brash actions...

44:00.596 --> 44:03.598
you have placed the universe
in absolute turmoil.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.933
Excuse me, but the turmoil began...

44:06.101 --> 44:09.228
when the yellow element was stolen
under your watch.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.065
- We've heard enough.
- Indeed.

44:12.232 --> 44:17.278
Hal Jordan, it greatly disappoints me
that in the judgment of this tribunal...

44:17.446 --> 44:20.239
you have been found
of insufficient discipline...

44:20.407 --> 44:23.076
to carry on the duties
of a Green Lantern.

44:23.243 --> 44:25.745
Will the sergeant-at-arms
please come forth?

44:28.374 --> 44:31.876
You shall hand your ring over
to Commander Kilowog.

44:45.265 --> 44:50.728
Kilowog, you will keep the ring
until the Guardians choose its successor.

44:50.896 --> 44:52.397
And what of the yellow element?

44:52.564 --> 44:56.025
I suggest we call a special session
with our honor guard...

44:56.193 --> 44:58.277
to devise our next strategy.

44:58.445 --> 44:59.779
I can arrange that, sir.

44:59.947 --> 45:04.450
If there is nothing more,
this tribunal is over.

45:31.645 --> 45:32.729
Are you my ride home?

45:32.896 --> 45:37.150
We both volunteered.
Kilowog has something to say to you.

45:37.484 --> 45:40.069
I'm sorry I said the things
I said about you.

45:40.237 --> 45:43.823
You saved my life.
You are a brave and bold Green Lantern.

45:43.991 --> 45:45.158
Thanks, Kilowog.

45:47.786 --> 45:50.705
- You gonna eat that?
- Go for it.

45:59.423 --> 46:01.883
- Quite a day, huh?
- I'm sorry.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.510
- Did you notice how calm he was?
- Who?

46:04.678 --> 46:08.014
Sinestro. He even defended me,
in a half-assed way.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.432
He's always been political.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.518
Would he have known where
the Guardians hid the yellow element?

46:12.686 --> 46:14.771
- They trust him.
- He hates them, you know.

46:15.355 --> 46:16.856
He's critical.

46:17.191 --> 46:20.193
Uh-uh. No, no. He can't stand them.

46:20.944 --> 46:24.530
What did the Guardian mean when he said
the Energi-Rod might be helpful?

46:24.698 --> 46:28.951
Kanjar Ro controlled it through his thoughts.
It might contain some psionic information.

46:29.119 --> 46:30.912
Like where he put the yellow element?

46:31.079 --> 46:33.831
Ranakar doesn't know his butt
from his poozer.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.001
Even if you had the rod...

46:37.169 --> 46:39.879
you can't use it
without Kanjar Ro's brainwaves...

46:40.047 --> 46:43.174
and that transmitter has been shut off
for good.

46:44.927 --> 46:48.679
- Are you ready?
- Are we in a hurry?

47:06.365 --> 47:07.907
This is him.

47:30.347 --> 47:32.431
I know it's cold, Kanjar Ro.

47:32.599 --> 47:34.892
I'm sorry about that.

47:35.227 --> 47:36.352
Where...?

47:36.520 --> 47:38.563
You're in the morgue. You're dead.

47:38.730 --> 47:41.065
- Dead?
- I killed you.

47:41.233 --> 47:45.570
I'm reconnecting synapses for some
information. This shouldn't take long.

47:45.737 --> 47:47.905
You remember the yellow element, right?

47:48.073 --> 47:49.240
Yellow.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.285
You left it with the Weaponers.
Where are they?

47:53.287 --> 47:54.579
Qwar...

47:55.247 --> 47:56.581
One more time.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.458
Qwar...

47:59.626 --> 48:03.588
Perhaps you can show me.
Let's sit up, shall we?

48:08.510 --> 48:12.638
All right, now. Where are the Weaponers?
Where is the yellow element?

48:22.733 --> 48:26.193
Sector 324. Very good.

48:26.361 --> 48:28.070
Can you be more specific?

48:36.038 --> 48:38.414
- Qward.
- Wow.

48:38.582 --> 48:40.499
Can you find the nearest pizza joint too?

48:44.338 --> 48:46.756
Well, well, this is a surprise.

48:47.674 --> 48:49.675
What's going on, Sinestro?

48:49.843 --> 48:51.344
It's fairly evident, Kilowog.

48:51.511 --> 48:54.430
I've been working behind the scenes
to find the yellow element.

48:54.598 --> 48:56.349
You killed Kanjar Ro.

48:56.516 --> 48:58.184
To save his hide.

49:01.271 --> 49:04.023
Careful now.
You don't want to damage the Energi-Rod.

49:04.191 --> 49:07.109
The core is quite unstable,
I've been told.

49:07.277 --> 49:08.694
You lied to the Guardians.

49:08.862 --> 49:10.613
I've lied to everyone. I've had to.

49:10.781 --> 49:12.239
- Why?
- Think about it.

49:12.407 --> 49:15.785
How did Kanjar Ro know exactly
where to find the yellow element?

49:15.953 --> 49:18.371
How was Abin Sur killed so quickly?

49:19.706 --> 49:22.041
- Are you saying there's a traitor?
- Of course.

49:22.209 --> 49:24.710
Why do you think
I wanted to work with Earth boy?

49:24.878 --> 49:26.879
At least I could be sure he was clean.

49:27.047 --> 49:28.881
You should've told the Guardians.

49:29.049 --> 49:30.216
In due time.

49:30.384 --> 49:33.135
Let's get the yellow
element first, Kilowog.

49:33.303 --> 49:34.804
Then we'll all be heroes.

49:36.932 --> 49:39.141
Take off your ring.

49:40.727 --> 49:43.145
Don't be ridiculous. Boodikka?

49:43.313 --> 49:47.149
Sorry, Sinestro. I don't think
you can talk your way out of this one.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.069
- Ugh!
- Jeez.

50:03.834 --> 50:04.875
He's still alive.

50:05.043 --> 50:08.337
If she had killed him, his ring
would have flown to the Guardians.

50:08.505 --> 50:11.173
And we'd rather not have that happen
just yet.

50:11.341 --> 50:14.802
It was Jordan's idea to come here.
I was hoping you'd be gone by now.

50:14.970 --> 50:16.345
I told you he was bright.

50:17.681 --> 50:18.848
You played me.

50:19.016 --> 50:22.101
I needed to get inside your head,
see if you should join our club.

50:22.269 --> 50:23.602
But you're not easy to read.

50:23.770 --> 50:26.105
We really need to talk
about personal space.

50:26.773 --> 50:28.441
It's not too late, Jordan.

50:28.608 --> 50:31.861
Boodikka believes in my vision.
Others will too.

50:32.029 --> 50:36.115
But I could use someone like you
who has the stones to get things done.

50:36.283 --> 50:38.117
While the gnomes banish you...

50:38.285 --> 50:42.705
I offer you power,
more power than you can imagine.

50:42.873 --> 50:45.541
All I ask is for is your loyalty.

50:46.460 --> 50:49.628
Now, you see, you had me.
Right up until that last part.

50:50.964 --> 50:53.340
And I thought humans were different.

50:53.508 --> 50:55.134
Take care of him.

50:59.139 --> 51:02.683
You can hide his body with Ro's.
I shouldn't be long.

51:26.666 --> 51:29.335
Knock me out, will you?

52:28.562 --> 52:30.563
Humans.

53:04.431 --> 53:06.265
Good God.

53:38.381 --> 53:39.423
You're a Weaponer.

53:41.259 --> 53:42.760
I'm here for the yellow element.

53:44.054 --> 53:48.265
You are not the one.

53:48.433 --> 53:50.976
Kanjar Ro is dead. I was his partner.

53:51.311 --> 53:54.438
He told me to come to Qward
to pick the weapon up here.

53:54.606 --> 53:56.982
He paid for it and now it's mine.

54:03.990 --> 54:06.992
Listen, I don't have time for this. I...

54:20.507 --> 54:22.007
Your friend...

54:22.175 --> 54:23.259
is late.

54:23.426 --> 54:27.429
The weapon is now in forfeiture.

54:27.597 --> 54:31.350
It is yours to take.

55:03.008 --> 55:07.052
This is your control.

55:45.550 --> 55:48.761
Our work is done.

55:48.928 --> 55:55.267
We leave this world to return to our own.

55:55.435 --> 55:58.937
The weapon is a mighty force.

55:59.105 --> 56:05.819
The most powerful and absolute
in your universe.

56:05.987 --> 56:08.197
With one exception.

56:08.365 --> 56:09.531
One...

56:09.699 --> 56:10.824
slight...

56:10.992 --> 56:14.036
imperfection.

56:14.204 --> 56:15.287
What?

56:15.455 --> 56:18.290
The imperfection...

56:18.458 --> 56:22.378
every weapon has.

56:23.129 --> 56:26.298
Its user.

56:47.445 --> 56:49.488
So they got Boodikka.

56:49.656 --> 56:52.449
I start alone, I end alone.

56:56.246 --> 56:57.830
The Guardians want to see you.

56:57.997 --> 56:59.164
And I them.

56:59.666 --> 57:01.333
What are you doing, Sinestro?

57:01.501 --> 57:03.335
Only what's necessary, Tomar.

57:05.004 --> 57:10.426
Oh, don't look so glum. The universe
has become too big for the gnomes.

57:20.270 --> 57:22.855
There's a new day dawning.

57:23.022 --> 57:24.940
A new sun rising.

57:33.491 --> 57:38.203
He was our most brilliant Lantern.
A paragon of duty and service.

57:38.371 --> 57:40.164
The cleverest of them all.

57:40.331 --> 57:43.876
Perhaps too clever, Ranakar.
We should have seen the signs.

57:44.043 --> 57:49.006
Until Sinestro gets an opportunity
to explain himself, I remain skeptical.

57:49.174 --> 57:52.342
One thing's for sure,
you took the ring off the wrong guy.

57:52.510 --> 57:55.304
You ask me, you should give it back.

57:57.849 --> 57:59.308
When you're ready.

58:13.573 --> 58:15.616
It's lost its power.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.410
Tomar.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.830
He killed them all.

58:55.448 --> 58:57.533
So it is true.

58:57.700 --> 59:00.786
Yes, Ganthet.
A new command is at hand.

59:00.954 --> 59:03.956
- A new authority.
- How dare you?

59:04.123 --> 59:08.126
- It's an affront to...
- Shut your mouth, you stupid little troll!

59:08.503 --> 59:13.048
You're nothing but a clutch of bickering old
biddies, ineffectual and obstructionist.

59:13.216 --> 59:16.969
In a galaxy screaming for order,
you have cast a deaf ear...

59:17.136 --> 59:19.972
but all that ends now.

59:20.139 --> 59:22.474
As demigods bound by your word...

59:22.642 --> 59:27.145
all of you are going to pledge
your undying allegiance to me.

59:27.897 --> 59:29.064
Like hell!

59:29.232 --> 59:30.899
For once, Ranakar, we agree.

59:43.329 --> 59:45.831
Give this up, Sinestro.

59:55.383 --> 59:56.717
Unh!

59:58.845 --> 01:00:01.513
It must be difficult to relinquish power.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:04.308
Let me give you some incentive.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:28.957
You will have nothing.
Not even your lives, in the end.

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:40.052
Gotta go, guy.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.059
Stand back.

01:02:09.475 --> 01:02:11.143
Good man.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:32.831
What the hell?

01:02:36.461 --> 01:02:38.336
Happy landings.

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.970
It's dead.

01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:06.925
The Lanterns.

01:04:07.927 --> 01:04:12.180
Yes, all the ones in space,
with no power and no protection.

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:16.142
You are generals without an army,
in a war you cannot win.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:18.061
How many more have to die?

01:04:18.229 --> 01:04:20.730
Enough, Sinestro. Please.

01:04:21.232 --> 01:04:23.900
We will accede to your demands.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:39.124
Come on, get green!

01:04:42.962 --> 01:04:45.088
Oh, son of a....

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:16.328
The rings. Now.

01:05:44.398 --> 01:05:48.109
Frankly, Kilowog,
you weren't going to survive this anyway.

01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.280
Huh?

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.490
I'll be damned.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:41.830
And you thought I was green before.

01:06:42.581 --> 01:06:44.165
Jordan.

01:07:50.941 --> 01:07:52.692
- Do you see him?
- I...

01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.069
I can't tell.

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:03.179
The bastard's here somewhere.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.286
It's over, Sinestro.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:14.250
I still have plenty of juice left in this
ring. Enough to take yours for insurance.

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.303
You're not strong enough.

01:10:25.471 --> 01:10:28.640
Just takes a little incentive.

01:12:00.399 --> 01:12:02.400
Excuse me, poozer.

01:12:10.659 --> 01:12:11.909
Jordan, can you hear me?

01:12:12.077 --> 01:12:13.202
Come in, Jordan.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:16.164
Where are you?

01:12:16.749 --> 01:12:19.167
Falling. I forgot my chute.

01:12:40.731 --> 01:12:41.939
Very creative.

01:12:42.107 --> 01:12:43.775
Hey, I got a few tricks too.

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.702
Though we continue to mourn
those who have fallen...

01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:57.872
during the tragic betrayal
of recent days...

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.959
we also celebrate our resiliency.

01:13:02.127 --> 01:13:05.963
Our battery is repaired,
our rings replenished...

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:09.425
and our battle
against the dark forces continues.

01:13:09.593 --> 01:13:12.804
If we have learned anything
from our last battle...

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:17.934
it is that great evil can arise
from the most unexpected sources...

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:22.730
but, most thankfully,
so can great heroism.

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:27.443
I've asked Ganthet
to lead us in our pledge.

01:13:27.611 --> 01:13:29.821
If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:34.242
I'd like to give that privilege
to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.

01:13:36.161 --> 01:13:37.954
Hear, hear.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:40.498
What's the matter?

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.000
I just learned the thing this morning.

01:13:48.048 --> 01:13:49.841
In brightest day...

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:55.179
In blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

01:13:55.347 --> 01:13:58.307
Let those who worship evil's might...

01:13:58.475 --> 01:14:03.312
beware my power,
Green Lantern's light!

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:11.487
I'm off.

01:14:11.655 --> 01:14:12.989
Where are you going?

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.658
I've gotta go punch a clock
with my other boss.

01:14:16.368 --> 01:14:19.036
I can see where this is gonna be
a long commute.
