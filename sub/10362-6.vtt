00:19.000 --> 00:21.520
[Frank]
It ain't safe around here no more.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.160
[gunshots]

00:23.240 --> 00:26.840
I'm gonna give you the cocksucker,
but I got some demands.

00:26.920 --> 00:28.960
I'm thinking Lilyhammer.

00:29.040 --> 00:30.600
[agent]
Here's the file to your new identity.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.880
From now on,
you're Giovanni Henriksen.

00:32.960 --> 00:35.640
I had a very successful bar
in New York, you know.

00:35.720 --> 00:37.280
Is this blackmail?

00:37.360 --> 00:39.840
I just need you to make a few moves
so I can get a local license.

00:39.920 --> 00:44.240
[Anderson]  Yeah, it seems like Tagliano is
maybe not so "disappeared" after all.

00:44.320 --> 00:47.680
- Here we are.
- That place?

00:50.920 --> 00:54.000
Where's that piece of shit
Frank Tagliano hiding, huh?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.240
[gunshot echoes]

00:57.320 --> 01:01.960
Pack your lederhosen, boys.
You're going to Norway.

01:02.040 --> 01:04.440
[theme music playing]

01:45.680 --> 01:48.000
I can't believe they booked us
on economy fucking class.

01:48.080 --> 01:51.040
- We're here now. Get over it.
- Couldn't even stretch my legs out.

01:51.120 --> 01:52.440
My pants are all creased for fuck's sake.

01:52.520 --> 01:55.400
- Walk around like everybody else does.
- Sign there.

01:55.480 --> 01:59.800
- Is this your first time in Norway, or?
- Yep, first and last.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.840
You're on holiday?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.520
Yeah, you could say that.
We're visiting an old friend

02:03.600 --> 02:05.760
who doesn't even know we're coming.

02:05.840 --> 02:07.120
Won't he be surprised?

02:07.200 --> 02:09.800
Yeah, he'll be surprised all right.
Thanks.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.880
- Let's go, let's get out of here.
- Take it easy.

02:23.080 --> 02:25.040
- Shit.
- What are you doing?

02:25.120 --> 02:26.520
How the fuck do you get heat
out of this thing?

02:26.600 --> 02:27.800
What, you're cold?

02:27.880 --> 02:29.600
Yeah, I thought it was supposed
to be spring here.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.160
Well, why don't you put on a sweater,
like I did?

02:32.240 --> 02:33.280
They itch.

02:33.360 --> 02:35.640
- They itch?
- Yeah, they fucking itch.

02:44.120 --> 02:48.320
[in Norwegian]
So all you have to do is sign here,

02:48.400 --> 02:50.560
and the place is yours.

02:51.560 --> 02:52.840
[man] Hello?

02:52.920 --> 02:55.000
- Hello. Hi, sir.
- Hi.

02:55.080 --> 02:58.920
Hi, there. Thought I'd just remind you
about the resident clean-up tomorrow.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.880
Well, now, it's like this:
Henriksen here is taking over today.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.480
Oh? Then you're just in time
for the  dugnad.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.560
[in English]
Now you got me.  "Dugnad"?

03:09.640 --> 03:12.480
It's when the neighbors,
they come together

03:12.560 --> 03:17.120
and they clean the yard
and wash the stairs and stuff like that.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.360
We have no cleaning people?

03:19.440 --> 03:22.200
[in Norwegian] In this co-ownership,
we do it all ourselves.

03:24.120 --> 03:26.040
[in English]
Great.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.760
[bell tolling]

03:32.040 --> 03:34.360
[man in Norwegian]
The world is a place full of danger,

03:34.440 --> 03:37.440
and that is something Geir knew
better than anyone.

03:37.520 --> 03:40.320
He chose to dedicate his life to making
Lillehammer

03:40.400 --> 03:42.720
a safe place to live in,

03:42.800 --> 03:48.880
and it is therefore especially tragic that
he should be a victim of blind violence

03:48.960 --> 03:52.720
while he was on holiday
in his beloved USA.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.480
May peace be with the memory
of Geir Tvedt.

04:11.560 --> 04:15.000
My condolences, Laila.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.400
Good to see you, Hans.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.760
Let me know if you need some extra help
down at the station.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.840
I'll let you know.

04:26.040 --> 04:27.680
Excuse me. Østli?

04:29.200 --> 04:31.960
I'm sorry to disturb you, Østli, but...

04:32.040 --> 04:34.840
Did you contact the American police?

04:34.920 --> 04:36.840
Oh, yes, sort of...

04:36.920 --> 04:40.080
There's something that's not right.

04:40.160 --> 04:43.960
I'm wondering whether Geir was conducting
some kind of investigation over there.

04:44.040 --> 04:46.760
Call it what you like.
Detective Anderson,

04:46.840 --> 04:51.040
with whom I spoke,
said it was a "drug-related incident."

04:51.120 --> 04:53.280
- Drug-related?
- Yeah.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.840
But Geir hadn't anything to do with drugs?

04:54.920 --> 04:59.520
Geir was located in a known trouble-spot,
accompanied by a prostitute.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.960
A lady-boy, to boot.

05:02.040 --> 05:07.880
Everything indicates that he was trying
to buy drugs and things went wrong.

05:07.960 --> 05:09.760
- I know...
- So,

05:09.840 --> 05:11.560
out of consideration to Geir's standing

05:11.640 --> 05:16.840
and not least the reputation of the force,
I think we should let this lie.

05:16.920 --> 05:20.560
I knew the lad had problems,
but not that it was this bad.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.720
It'll only be worse
if you start digging, Laila.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.640
[in English]
You sure this is the house?

05:36.720 --> 05:40.200
[in Norwegian]
Yeah, this should be the right address.

05:40.280 --> 05:41.920
[in English]
Yeah. Well, it better be.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.000
We need Arnie's muscle
to get this thing up to the apartment.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.440
So why couldn't your brother help us out?

05:48.520 --> 05:50.280
[in Norwegian] He's gonna drive
some liquor over the border

05:50.360 --> 05:52.200
for Aass and the guys.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.840
[in English]
You sure that's a good idea?

05:57.920 --> 06:00.320
[in Norwegian]
What is it with you and my brother?

06:00.400 --> 06:04.240
[in English] Not for nothing, everything
your brother touches turns to shit.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.840
And it flows down on me.

06:05.920 --> 06:10.640
Relax. My brother ain't no idiot.
He's okay.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.160
Hey, hey, hey, look at this.

06:16.920 --> 06:20.040
Jesus, that's a foxy lady.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.160
- Geez, that's not bad.
- She's hot.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.960
Hey, what do you say, kid?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.680
Hey, that's some wife you got there.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.280
- Wife?
- Yeah.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.120
[in Norwegian]
That there was Mom.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.800
- [in English] That's your mother?
- Yeah.

06:37.880 --> 06:40.440
[in Norwegian]
So you're still living with your mom?

06:40.520 --> 06:41.680
We don't...

06:41.760 --> 06:43.880
I've got my own ground-floor apartment
with its own entrance.

06:43.960 --> 06:47.400
- [in English] Can you believe this kid?
- [in Norwegian] Fucking hell.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.360
[Norwegian]
Look, do you want help or don't you?

06:49.440 --> 06:51.280
[in English]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.280
Please don't tell mommy
we were making fun of you.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.120
Paying for number one.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.920
Yeah, that's 570 kroners, please.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.480
To fill up that tiny thing?
That's like a hundred fucking bucks!

07:17.560 --> 07:18.880
Yes.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.840
Kid, I'm from New York, all right?

07:20.920 --> 07:24.720
I'm used to punks like you trying to rip
me off. Come on, what's the real price?

07:24.800 --> 07:27.160
That's what it costs, 570 kroners.

07:27.240 --> 07:30.840
All right, kid. I'm not paying at all.
How do you like that, huh, smart-ass?

07:30.920 --> 07:33.720
You like that? Yeah?
Go fuck yourself, all right?

07:34.400 --> 07:37.640
Hey! Hey!

08:00.520 --> 08:02.440
[engine racing]

08:04.480 --> 08:09.640
[in Norwegian]
There! Put it there. Nice. Thanks.

08:09.720 --> 08:12.240
Well, if you're here for the clean-up,
then you're too late.

08:12.320 --> 08:14.240
[in English] Aw, geez,
I'm sorry I missed all the action.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.640
Let me contribute to the cause, all right?

08:20.520 --> 08:23.800
[in Norwegian]
Hey, hey! What is that?

08:23.880 --> 08:25.600
[in English]
A real '50s Wurlitzer.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.200
[in Norwegian]
The walls are pretty thin here.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.960
[in English]
The walls, very thin.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.440
[in English]
Don't worry about a thing.

08:31.520 --> 08:34.960
It's gonna be like milk and honey
in your ears. Come on, boys.

08:45.920 --> 08:48.000
Better get those bags there.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.920
My legs are still sore, man.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.480
[mutters] Fucking carry...

08:53.480 --> 08:54.640
Hi.

08:56.800 --> 08:58.400
We have a reservation.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.160
Somewhere here.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.080
Thank you.

09:13.640 --> 09:17.720
- That will be your room, 216.
- 216.

09:17.800 --> 09:18.840
Good.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.600
Where's my room?

09:20.680 --> 09:24.160
You booked a double room, so...

09:24.240 --> 09:26.760
- [Jerry] What... What the...
- This must be a misunderstanding.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.840
- Could you check the book again, please?
- Yeah, sure. No.

09:29.920 --> 09:31.840
- How's he think I'm gonna sleep?
- Relax.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.840
No, no, you booked a double room

09:34.920 --> 09:38.800
and because of a conference,
we're completely full. Sorry.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.240
You're sorry. You're fucking
pissing me off, is what you're doing.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.840
Jerry, relax.
We'll straighten it out.

09:43.920 --> 09:45.840
- 216.
- Yeah.

09:45.920 --> 09:49.200
Thank you.
You can sleep on the sofa.

09:50.920 --> 09:52.080
Come on.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.640
[in Norwegian]
That's a big fucking oven.

09:58.720 --> 10:00.000
Yeah, it's huge.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.120
[in English]
Your oven is huge.

10:03.280 --> 10:07.360
- To new beginnings.
- [Torgeir] Cheers.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.960
[in Norwegian]
Cheers.

10:10.480 --> 10:12.760
Better be getting off home now.

10:12.840 --> 10:14.840
[in English] What's the matter,
Mommy got you on a leash?

10:14.920 --> 10:17.960
[in Norwegian]   I'd happily buy my own pad,
too, if I had the dough.

10:18.040 --> 10:19.000
Talk to you later.

10:19.080 --> 10:19.920
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.480
Gotta get home and fix some stuff.

10:21.560 --> 10:24.360
[in English] Hang on a minute, Arne.
What about my place?

10:24.440 --> 10:26.120
[in Norwegian]
What do you mean?

10:26.200 --> 10:29.840
[in English] The row house. It's leased
for a long time. I'm not using it.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.000
[in Norwegian]
But how much rent are you asking?

10:33.080 --> 10:36.840
[in English]
Rent? What rent? We're friends.

10:39.480 --> 10:41.400
[in Norwegian]
Are you serious?

10:41.480 --> 10:44.520
Fuck, are you the man, or what?

10:44.600 --> 10:48.680
Torgeir, he's lending me his place! Yeah!

[Rufus Thomas' "Can Your Monkey
Do the Dog" playing on jukebox]

10:56.160 --> 10:57.920

It's catchy.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.480
Let's party!

11:08.400 --> 11:11.760
- [muffled music playing]
- [cheering and stomping]

11:37.120 --> 11:39.400
[in Norwegian]
It was an American, you said?

11:39.480 --> 11:41.280
No. Two.

11:41.360 --> 11:43.520
There was one waiting in the car, too.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.440
- Two Americans now?
- Yeah.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.600
[in English] You're gonna have to start
looking without me, all right?

12:00.680 --> 12:02.840
What do you mean
start looking without you?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.840
My body's fucked.

12:04.920 --> 12:08.040
You don't call in sick
in this line of work, Jerry.

12:08.120 --> 12:11.840
Sorry.
Look at me, for fuck's sake.

12:11.920 --> 12:15.160
Just call me or something
if you find anything, all right?

12:22.840 --> 12:24.040
Fuck it.

12:25.320 --> 12:28.120
[knocking on door]

12:31.440 --> 12:34.600
[knocking continues]

12:41.640 --> 12:45.600
[in Norwegian]
Hi! Did I wake you up?

12:45.680 --> 12:48.080
[in English] Yeah, it's the middle
of the fucking night for me.

12:48.160 --> 12:52.320
[in Norwegian] It's just I found these
in the paper trash container.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.000
[in English] So?

12:54.080 --> 12:57.120
[in Norwegian] We need to get it sorted
out before the garbage collectors turn up.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.880
Come on.

13:00.160 --> 13:03.160
- [in English] That one.
- That one?

13:08.640 --> 13:10.640
[in Norwegian]
There, that wasn't so hard, was it?

13:10.720 --> 13:12.880
I brought the house rules with me, too.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.760
[in English] The house rules.

13:14.840 --> 13:17.520
[in Norwegian] We don't play music
after 11 o'clock in this building.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.520

Where's the paper bin?

13:21.600 --> 13:23.880
[in Norwegian]
The paper bin? There. Why?

13:23.960 --> 13:25.240
[in English]
Right there?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.280
That's what I think of your fucking rules.

[Jan in Norwegian]
Thank you, everyone.

13:56.160 --> 14:00.200
Are immigrants a resource,
we may ask.

14:03.040 --> 14:06.720
Yes, is my answer.

14:08.800 --> 14:12.240
This is Johnny Henriksen.

14:12.320 --> 14:16.280
Johnny came to me
with two empty hands.

14:16.360 --> 14:19.080
Two empty hands and a lot of vitality.

14:19.160 --> 14:24.040
I gave him some advice,
put him through the Fresh Start scheme.

14:25.600 --> 14:28.520
And very shortly after,

14:28.600 --> 14:33.840
he was running
the most popular place in town.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.480
Don't change it until I...

14:36.880 --> 14:39.800
Now you can change.

14:39.880 --> 14:43.760
Stories like this don't grow on trees.

14:43.840 --> 14:46.520
They don't.
But they are out there.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.200
They are out there,
and that's why we do this.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.840

[Johnny in English]
Oh, yeah, check this out.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.560
It's even got one of those PlayBox things.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.040
You know, for the kids.

15:09.120 --> 15:12.160
Yeah, and look at this.

15:14.480 --> 15:17.400
- What do you think?
- [rapid gunfire on video game]

15:17.480 --> 15:20.840
[in Norwegian]
Is that a violent game?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.880
[in English] No, that's
just the normal healthy boy stuff.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.600
[gunfire and screaming]

15:26.680 --> 15:30.520
- I haven't shown you the best thing, yet.
- Okay, and what's that?

15:30.600 --> 15:32.320
Jacuzzi?

15:32.400 --> 15:34.720
The perfect bathtub for the kids.

15:34.800 --> 15:39.040
[in Norwegian] You can't put small babies
into such a big bathtub.

15:39.120 --> 15:42.040
[in English] What? The whirlpool is
good for the circulation, no?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.880
[in Norwegian] Jesus.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.120
[sighs]

15:47.200 --> 15:52.760
[in English] Look. How about you and Jonas
stay tonight, help me the break place in?

15:56.080 --> 16:00.320
- Okay.
- That's my girl.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.640
[in Norwegian]
Cheers.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.880
What's "orange marmalade"?

16:07.960 --> 16:10.280
[both speaking Spanish]

16:15.520 --> 16:16.840
[laughs]

16:16.920 --> 16:19.000
- No, it isn't...
- Come on, try.

16:19.080 --> 16:21.120
[speaking Spanish]

16:21.200 --> 16:25.400
[in English] Excuse me. I got to tell you,
I was really intrigued by your speech.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.880
- Thank you.
- Look, can I ask you a few questions?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.600
- Sure, sure.
- Yeah, thanks.

16:30.680 --> 16:35.120
Hey, do you mind if you just give me
a moment? Thanks?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.720
[in Norwegian]
I'll be there soon.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.160
[in English]
Look, that Johnny guy,

16:41.240 --> 16:44.320
that story about that Johnny
is very intriguing.

16:44.400 --> 16:48.520
The nightclub you were talking about,
now, is it around here somewhere?

16:48.600 --> 16:52.920
Yes, it's just downtown in Elvegata.

16:53.000 --> 16:56.320
- Elve...
- Elvegata.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.720
- Elvegata.
- The Flamingo bar.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.560
I answered your questions,
maybe I could...

17:02.640 --> 17:05.160
Yeah. No problem.
You've been more than helpful.

17:05.240 --> 17:07.120
- Good-bye.
- Take care of yourself.

17:08.480 --> 17:09.720
[TV playing indistinctly]

17:09.800 --> 17:12.280
[door opens, closes]

17:12.360 --> 17:14.320
[laughing]

17:16.480 --> 17:18.840
Hey, rough day?

17:18.920 --> 17:22.240
- So how you doing with the search?
- No leads on our guy.

17:22.320 --> 17:25.640
Here, take a look at this.

17:25.720 --> 17:29.120
- What's this?
- Directions to the Flamingo.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.840
It's run by one Johnny Henriksen,

17:30.920 --> 17:33.840
some Italian-American dude
who just got here.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.040
You're shitting me.
How the fuck did you find out about this?

17:37.120 --> 17:39.520
It's no biggie. Just did some research
at the bar, that's all.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.680
So I'm busting my ass, breaking my balls
and you stumble into this over drinks?

17:42.760 --> 17:46.280
What can I say, I'm a class act.
Can't help myself.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.440
[alarm ringing]

17:50.520 --> 17:52.960
- [in Norwegian] What's that?
- [smoke alarm beeping]

17:53.040 --> 17:56.000
- [in English] Fire. Jonas.
- [in Norwegian] Oh, my God!

17:58.640 --> 18:01.240
[alarm ringing]

18:03.880 --> 18:06.480
So, that's the last lot accounted for.
What did it come to?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.640
Seven minutes and 43 seconds.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.280
It's just the loft unit
that wasn't up to scratch.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.840
[in English]
What the fuck is going on?

18:12.920 --> 18:14.600
[in Norwegian]
As you've been notified in the mailbox,

18:14.680 --> 18:17.000
we're having our twice-yearly
fire drill here tonight.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.160
[in English] What about the smoke?
The kid was scared half to death.

18:19.240 --> 18:21.680
[in Norwegian] Smoke makes it
much more realistic, don't you think?

18:21.760 --> 18:24.040
You can go and turn off
the smoke machine now.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.240
Jesus.

18:25.320 --> 18:29.680
Well, thanks for taking part, folks.
And to most of you, well done!

18:35.240 --> 18:38.000
[in English] There was no letter.
I'd remember.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.760
[in Norwegian] Maybe I overlooked
one of the mailboxes.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.600
[in English]
Maybe you're a slimy fuck.

18:44.680 --> 18:48.600
[in Norwegian] If it had been a real fire,
you would have all been dead.

18:48.680 --> 18:50.560
You should be thanking me.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.800
[in English] Get that condescending finger
out of my face.

18:53.880 --> 18:55.360
Ow! [gasps]

19:11.560 --> 19:14.640
[The Len Price 3's
"Viva Viva" playing on truck's radio]

19:24.920 --> 19:27.400
[Roar humming along to song on radio]

19:33.400 --> 19:36.000
[in Norwegian]
What do you think you're doing?

19:36.080 --> 19:38.360
Well, I...

19:38.440 --> 19:40.920
I'm just the driver.
I don't...

19:41.000 --> 19:45.840
I'm just driving this for a friend
of mine. I've no idea what's in the back.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.760
I think we're actually talking about
urinating in a public area.

19:49.840 --> 19:52.320
Oh, right, that.
That's not good.

19:52.400 --> 19:55.400
But maybe we should take a look
in the back, too?

19:55.480 --> 19:58.840
- Do you have to do that? You do.
- I'm afraid we do.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.120
[indistinct police radio chatter]

20:31.280 --> 20:34.760
So, here we are then, Roar Lien.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.320
Yes.

20:37.400 --> 20:40.920
Just a short question.
Are you...

20:41.000 --> 20:42.840
I mean, who are...

20:42.920 --> 20:44.680
Terje and I work for Catch.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.840
Special unit against organized crime.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.800
I'm not...

20:52.880 --> 20:55.840
I'm not very organized,
let's just say that. It's... I don't...

20:55.920 --> 21:00.400
But I don't know anything
about anything, you know.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.000
Really?

21:05.920 --> 21:08.760
Your truck was full of illegal alcohol.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.600
It says on some of the pallets
that they're to be delivered

21:11.680 --> 21:14.880
to a bar in Lillehammer called...

21:15.560 --> 21:16.960
Flamingo.

21:17.040 --> 21:19.400
It said that, did it? Um...

21:21.600 --> 21:23.080
Um...

21:25.080 --> 21:28.400
I was just wondering, how is it...

21:28.480 --> 21:32.960
If I say something here,
will others know of it?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.760
People won't have to know?

21:35.840 --> 21:37.360
- No, they don't.
- No.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.240
[in English]
I was checking the inventory in the back.

21:51.320 --> 21:52.840
Seemed a little light.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.480
Anything missing?

21:55.560 --> 22:01.480
[in Norwegian]   Seems it got confiscated.
My brother had an unlucky trip.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.160
[in English]
The police took it.

22:06.760 --> 22:10.920
- Did they get him?
- No, he got away.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.600
But the car was...

22:12.680 --> 22:14.920
[in Norwegian]
It was left there.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.560
[in English] That's nice.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.720
- The stupid fuck.
- Yeah.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.840
[cell phone ringing]

22:24.640 --> 22:25.840
Yeah, Arne.

22:25.920 --> 22:28.360
[in Norwegian]  Hey, it's me.
You wouldn't happen to have an extra key?

22:28.440 --> 22:31.640
[in English]
Okay, I'll play. Why?

22:31.720 --> 22:33.840
[in Norwegian]   I've locked myself out,
with a pizza in the oven.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.800
[sighs]

22:35.880 --> 22:37.280
[in English]
I'll be right there.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.680
[in Norwegian]
Thanks. Bye.

22:49.560 --> 22:53.440
You should have let me just whack him
in front of his stupid club.

22:53.520 --> 22:55.200
Your uncle told us not to make any fuss.

22:55.280 --> 22:58.480
You think blowing his brains out here
on the main street is what he had in mind?

22:58.560 --> 22:59.720
No.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.920
It's just those fucking snitches,
you know?

23:03.000 --> 23:04.840
Make my index finger twitch.

23:06.240 --> 23:08.280
Jerry, now stay with him,
stay with him.

23:08.360 --> 23:09.760
[in Norwegian]
Laila Hovland?

23:09.840 --> 23:10.800
Terje Hansen.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.840
It concerns a liquor-smuggling outfit
we're in the process of clearing up.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.920
Here in Lillehammer?

23:18.000 --> 23:20.240
Do you know a Giovanni Henriksen?

23:22.840 --> 23:25.280
[in English] You're a fucking putz,
you know that?

23:26.120 --> 23:28.120
You're unbelievable.

23:32.840 --> 23:33.960
Get in here.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.560
[Jerry] This is where Tagliano lives?

23:43.640 --> 23:45.640
He should be grateful we're putting him
out of his misery.

23:45.720 --> 23:46.960
[sneezes]

24:01.640 --> 24:03.200
Shit. The cops.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.720
- They've been following us?
- Come on, let's go.

24:18.000 --> 24:19.680
Giovanni Henriksen?

24:21.320 --> 24:22.800
Yeah.

24:22.880 --> 24:24.920
[in Norwegian] I must ask you
to come down to the station with us.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.160
Oh...

24:28.640 --> 24:32.840
Call Julius. Have him meet me
down at the station right now.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.720
Let's go, Don Johnson.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.760
First I'm Al Qaeda, and now I'm some kind
of prohibition rum runner?

24:41.840 --> 24:44.240
What are you guys smoking over here?

24:44.320 --> 24:46.240
Al Qaeda?

24:46.320 --> 24:48.600
[in Norwegian]
Long story.

24:49.440 --> 24:50.880
Good day.

24:50.960 --> 24:52.840
[in English]
About time.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.400
[in Norwegian]   We've made
a substantial liquor seizure

24:55.480 --> 24:57.760
that implicates your client.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.320
[in English]
How do you explain this marking?

25:01.880 --> 25:03.920
You don't have to answer this.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.320
[in Norwegian]   If you don't have anything
more conclusive,

25:06.400 --> 25:08.920
then this interrogation is over.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.880
Well, we also have a witness

25:10.960 --> 25:14.280
who has indicated your client
as being one of the people behind this.

25:14.360 --> 25:16.000
A witness?

25:17.040 --> 25:18.440
[in English]
Who?

25:18.520 --> 25:20.840
[in Norwegian]
The witness testimony is confidential.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.360
[in English]
Bullshit.

25:24.760 --> 25:28.440
[in Norwegian]   With both physical evidence
and a witness testimony,

25:28.520 --> 25:31.480
the judge will probably assent to custody.

25:31.560 --> 25:32.840
Uh-huh.

25:32.920 --> 25:36.520
I'll have a word with Aass and the guys
and come up with a solution.

25:36.600 --> 25:40.400
[in English] A day or two,
and then you're out again.

25:40.480 --> 25:44.400
I can handle a couple days in a can,
but you got to fix this.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.960
[Sigrid in Norwegian]
Hi, hi.

26:07.760 --> 26:10.480
- Hi.
- Hi.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.080
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

26:12.160 --> 26:16.040
Have you seen Johnny? I tried to call,
but I can't get a hold of him.

26:16.120 --> 26:19.240
He had to go on a business trip.

26:19.320 --> 26:22.440
But surely he's got his phone with him?

26:24.280 --> 26:28.480
There's probably not a signal.
He's gone abroad.

26:28.560 --> 26:29.880
Abroad? Where?

26:29.960 --> 26:34.960
He had to go to...
the Baltics.

26:36.040 --> 26:39.840
- Okay?
- There were some equipment suppliers

26:39.920 --> 26:45.280
for the pub who wanted to talk to him,
so he just had to go.

26:45.360 --> 26:49.560
There are tons of e-mails,
so I'll have to get back to...

26:49.640 --> 26:52.280
But could you tell him to call me
if you hear from him?

26:52.360 --> 26:54.040
- Will do.
- Good.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.600
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

27:06.280 --> 27:08.200
[man in English]
Here are the toiletries.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.480
- This is my cell?
- Yes.

27:15.560 --> 27:18.800
- What? No minibar?
- [laughs] No.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.600
[in Norwegian]
Our philosophy here is that

27:21.680 --> 27:24.520
if people have nice surroundings,
they'll feel nicer inside, too.

27:24.600 --> 27:26.160
[in English]
You understand this?

27:26.240 --> 27:28.560
I understand I should have
been arrested a lot sooner.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.000
Yeah.

27:30.920 --> 27:32.840
[in Norwegian] That's right.
Tomorrow I've put you up

27:32.920 --> 27:35.760
for both music and the carpentry group.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.000
[in English]
Music and...

27:37.080 --> 27:39.600
- And carpentry.
- Carpentry.

27:39.680 --> 27:42.160
- Yeah? Okay.
- Yeah.

27:42.240 --> 27:46.560
[in Norwegian]   I'm afraid
I shall have to lock up now. Good night.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.360
Okay.

27:51.080 --> 27:55.680
[in Norwegian] Music is one of the things
we can use to counter negative feelings

27:55.760 --> 27:58.440
that may arise during
the imprisonment experience.

27:58.520 --> 28:03.640
Today we're going to explore
a useful tool we can use for this,

28:03.720 --> 28:05.440
playing the recorder.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.840
We're going to start with

28:08.920 --> 28:12.680
"Lisa Went to School"
and we all know that one.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.560
[playing simple melody]

28:49.360 --> 28:50.760
Didn't turn out too bad, eh?

28:50.840 --> 28:53.160
[in English]
Not bad kid. You are an artist.

28:53.240 --> 28:54.560
[in Norwegian]
Thanks.

28:58.160 --> 29:02.080
Look. Help yourself if you want.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.080
[in English]
I'd thought you'd never ask.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.360
[in Norwegian]   Now, have you been
pilfering in the kitchen again?

29:12.440 --> 29:14.720
The protein cold cuts are
for us bodybuilders.

29:14.800 --> 29:18.000
[in English] Excuse me,
that was my sandwich.

29:18.080 --> 29:22.080
[in Norwegian] You need an introduction
to how things work around here.

29:26.280 --> 29:27.840
[screaming]

29:27.920 --> 29:30.280
[in English] Anybody else wanna tell me
how things work around here?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.160
- Huh?
- [groaning]

29:32.240 --> 29:33.680
[Vidar in Norwegian]
What's going on?

29:33.760 --> 29:35.560
[in English]
Terrible accident.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.280
Place is unsafe.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.400
[in Norwegian]
It's not such a good idea with this...

29:39.480 --> 29:42.040
[in English] Don't touch it.
Don't touch it. You'll hurt yourself.

29:42.120 --> 29:43.880
There, call somebody.

29:50.640 --> 29:54.000
[in Norwegian] You have, do you?
Two American chaps?

29:54.080 --> 29:56.160
They've been here since Thursday.

29:56.240 --> 30:01.120
Then I think I'd better come over
and say hello.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.640
I feel so claustrophobic.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.840
He'll be here soon.

30:10.720 --> 30:13.640
Hello. There you go.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.720
You have 30 minutes.

30:18.560 --> 30:21.040
[in English]
They let you in?

30:21.120 --> 30:23.400
I said he was a legal assistant.

30:23.480 --> 30:25.200
You're a lawyer now?

30:25.280 --> 30:27.800
Who was your last client?
Joan of Arc?

30:27.880 --> 30:29.600
[laughing]

30:33.880 --> 30:36.560
So, uh, how's prison?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.760
It's great. It's like,
fucking, Christian summer camp.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.440
You gotta get me out of here.

30:41.520 --> 30:44.640
[in Norwegian]
We're working on it. Let me see.

30:44.720 --> 30:49.040
We've got some help
from a wine importer

30:49.120 --> 30:53.560
with receipts that explain
the liquor turnover.

30:53.640 --> 30:59.280
And the cops didn't find a thing
when they came to the Flamingo.

30:59.360 --> 31:03.400
As I see it, there's only one problem
that remains...

31:03.480 --> 31:04.560
[in English]
Uh-huh.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.480
The witness, huh?

31:10.920 --> 31:14.000
Well, uh, I hate to think it...

31:15.280 --> 31:17.120
and I hate to say it.

31:18.160 --> 31:19.880
But it's gotta be your brother.

31:22.520 --> 31:24.360
[in Norwegian]
My brother?

31:24.440 --> 31:26.520
[in English]
He was the only one there.

31:26.600 --> 31:30.080
[in Norwegian]
I've discussed it with Roy Aass.

31:31.840 --> 31:33.800
There's no other possibility.

31:33.880 --> 31:37.320
You can't let Aass loose on my brother.

31:37.400 --> 31:38.520
Please?

31:38.600 --> 31:41.720
[in English] That's why it was
important you came in today.

31:41.800 --> 31:47.440
You know, we're hoping you can fix this
before it gets ugly.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.960
- [knocking]
- [door opening]

31:49.040 --> 31:51.360
[in Norwegian]
We're sitting with our client here.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.360
Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you.

31:53.440 --> 31:56.600
Just had some roll cake left over
from the baking group.

31:56.680 --> 31:58.000
[in English]
Okay. Thanks.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.840
- Thanks there, Vidar.
- You are welcome.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.640
Let's have a go, eh?

32:08.680 --> 32:12.560
- This shit's good. Yeah.
- Mmm. It's very good.

32:42.080 --> 32:45.680
[in Norwegian] What gave you this idea?
It's been years since we went fishing.

32:56.920 --> 33:00.280
When you lost that load of booze,
did you talk to the cops?

33:00.360 --> 33:03.360
Give it a rest, Torgeir.
I've already told you.

33:03.440 --> 33:07.360
I've told you I got away
before the cops made their move.

33:07.440 --> 33:10.160
- You know this.
- You did, didn't you?

33:10.240 --> 33:12.680
[engines rumbling]

33:21.360 --> 33:23.200
What the fuck are they doing here?

33:26.280 --> 33:28.840
You went and called the biker guys?

33:28.920 --> 33:30.760
Everybody knows it's you.

33:32.440 --> 33:36.200
If you don't come clean with me,
I can't protect you anymore.

33:36.280 --> 33:40.120
But they said I'd have to do
eight years inside.

33:40.200 --> 33:43.480
That's the sort of crap they always say.

33:43.560 --> 33:45.680
You won't be inside for a year even.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.560
Yeah, but that's still
a long time, ain't it?

33:47.640 --> 33:50.960
You remember in eighth grade
when you set fire to the girls' washroom.

33:51.040 --> 33:55.480
I got expelled because everyone thought
it was me? I never let on who it was.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.880
No matter how much Dad thrashed me,

33:57.960 --> 34:00.080
I said nothing.

34:01.920 --> 34:04.000
Do you know why?
Why I didn't tell?

34:08.640 --> 34:10.720
'Cause we Lien boys, we don't snitch.

34:10.800 --> 34:12.240
No.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.960
No, we don't do that.

34:18.920 --> 34:20.200
[sighs]

34:20.280 --> 34:22.000
[barking]

34:22.080 --> 34:23.880
[TV audience laughs]

34:29.240 --> 34:30.920
[in English]
Fucking love this program.

34:32.040 --> 34:34.440
You got to see this.
You got to see this shit.

34:36.160 --> 34:37.880
Next time we're gonna plan it better.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.960
- Damn right, we're gonna plan--
- [knocking on door]

34:48.920 --> 34:52.680
[in Norwegian]
Hello? Could you open up?

34:53.800 --> 34:55.280
[whispering in English]
It's the cops.

34:56.520 --> 34:57.520
Shh.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.960
[in Norwegian]
Thank you.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.560
Halt!

35:20.520 --> 35:21.760
[grunts]

35:24.240 --> 35:26.000
[groans]

35:32.400 --> 35:33.960
[in English]
So, we're in the clear, huh?

35:34.040 --> 35:37.160
[in Norwegian] Sure thing. The whole case
collapsed when Lien changed his story.

35:37.240 --> 35:39.560
- Hey.
- [in English] There he is.

35:39.640 --> 35:41.760
Man of the hour.
Good job.

35:41.840 --> 35:42.800
Yeah.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.880
[in Norwegian]
My brother realized that he'd fucked up.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.720
He ain't like that really.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.360
- Here's the last horse.
- [in English] Thanks, Vidar.

35:54.440 --> 35:59.080
Hey, listen. I'll be seeing you again...
hopefully, never.

35:59.160 --> 36:02.400
- Okay. Thank you, sir.
- All right.

36:02.480 --> 36:05.000
[in Norwegian] You clear
the whole place out or what?

36:05.080 --> 36:08.280
[in English] You don't think I'd leave
Disneyland without some souvenirs, do you?

36:08.360 --> 36:09.360
Come on.

36:09.440 --> 36:10.560
[Julius in Norwegian]
Come on, Torgeir.

36:14.400 --> 36:16.000
[in English]
It's a real good one.

36:31.160 --> 36:35.200
- What the fuck?
- Bad news?

36:35.280 --> 36:38.200
It's got to be from my lunatic neighbor.

36:38.280 --> 36:39.760
- What?
- Take a look.

36:45.960 --> 36:48.560
[in Norwegian]
That you have behaved...

36:48.640 --> 36:51.840
[in English]
Threatening and violent in the fire drill.

36:51.920 --> 36:56.840
What? That's bullshit.
It was a little heated discussion.

36:56.920 --> 36:59.360
[in Norwegian]
Well, he's threatening to throw you out.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.760
[in English]
Can he do that?

37:02.840 --> 37:06.320
[in Norwegian]
I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

37:11.920 --> 37:14.080
[in English]
Better give this to Juli.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.760
It's time to make some moves
on this fat fuck.

37:16.840 --> 37:18.040
Okay.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.520
- Go ahead.
- Geez.

37:19.600 --> 37:22.040
I didn't know wood was so heavy.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.440
Hello.

37:26.680 --> 37:28.840
- Hey, babe.
- Hi.

37:28.920 --> 37:30.520
- How you doing?
- Hello.

37:32.920 --> 37:34.840
- So?
- So, listen,

37:34.920 --> 37:39.520
I'm sorry I didn't return
your call sooner. I got slightly detained.

37:39.600 --> 37:42.680
Yeah, I heard, but how was Baltikum?

37:42.760 --> 37:45.160
- Baltikum?
- Yeah.

37:45.240 --> 37:49.960
Torgeir told me that you were
going to Baltikum,   or did I misunderstand?

37:50.040 --> 37:51.200
- Oh Baltikum!
- Yeah.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.920
It was great. Terrific.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.480
- Yeah, I brought back some souvenirs.
- You did?

37:55.560 --> 37:57.240
- Wanna see 'em?
- Yeah.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.200
- Wow!
- Huh?

38:00.480 --> 38:03.200
[in Norwegian]
Oh, my God, they're so lovely.

38:03.280 --> 38:07.000
[in English] They're handmade,
by... Baltic craftspeople.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.200
[in Norwegian]
Yes, I can see that.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.240
[in English]
I've been thinking,

38:12.320 --> 38:16.960
what do you say we stick up
some bunny-type wallpaper?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.440
You think this would make
a good nursery?

38:21.520 --> 38:22.720
[in Norwegian] Absolutely.

38:25.000 --> 38:26.000
[in English] Come here.

38:41.600 --> 38:45.840
[Johnny] What's, uh,
"sameie video detector" mean?

38:45.920 --> 38:46.960
What?

38:48.720 --> 38:51.720
[sounding out words]
Sam-ei-e ved-te--

38:51.800 --> 38:53.280
[in Norwegian]
Co-ownership bylaws?

38:53.360 --> 38:55.760
[in English]
Yeah, that's what I said.

38:55.840 --> 38:58.760
It's laws for the building.

38:58.840 --> 39:03.520
[in Norwegian] When did you take
an interest in co-owner matters?

39:03.600 --> 39:07.200
[in English] It's a little disagreement
with that dickhead from the fire drill.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.760
Juli gave me a tip
on how to deal with the fuck.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.400
[door closes]

39:24.840 --> 39:27.840
[in Norwegian]
Extraordinary general meeting?

39:27.920 --> 39:30.360
Flamingo?

39:31.600 --> 39:36.240
What in God's name were you thinking?

39:36.320 --> 39:38.960
Jumping out of a window at your age?

39:41.240 --> 39:42.480
You doing all right?

39:42.560 --> 39:45.640
This is nothing.
I'll be back in a few days.

39:45.720 --> 39:47.880
We've already lost one,
we can't afford to lose anymore.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.840
There, there, Laila.

39:49.920 --> 39:52.160
What about the Americans?

39:52.240 --> 39:54.840
Had any more reports in about them?

39:54.920 --> 39:56.440
You know what.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.040
I think for now we should
let crooks be crooks. Close your eyes.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.280
- Smell.
- No...

40:05.360 --> 40:07.560
- Is it?
- Yes.

40:08.680 --> 40:10.760
- There you go.
- Oh.

40:10.840 --> 40:14.360
- Just a little bite.
- Take a big bite, Hans.

40:15.840 --> 40:16.880
Ooh...

40:16.960 --> 40:19.480
They're better than ever, Laila.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.560
[laughs]

40:34.240 --> 40:35.560
[in English]
Let's go.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.120
[singing "Start the Show"]

41:44.040 --> 41:46.600
Let's go to the back!
It's a little loud here!

41:46.680 --> 41:48.480
What?

41:48.560 --> 41:50.760
Back! Back!

42:11.160 --> 42:15.320
[in Norwegian] Who's paying for this then?
That'll be us, no doubt.

42:15.400 --> 42:17.680
[in English]
Relax. They're on the house.

42:20.880 --> 42:23.360
The reason I called the meeting today,

42:23.440 --> 42:26.480
is I'm worried about something
in our  sameie.

42:27.360 --> 42:30.800
I'd like to know if you folks
all feel the same way.

42:30.880 --> 42:33.280
According to my calculations,

42:33.360 --> 42:36.000
we have a problem
with the gardening expenses.

42:37.480 --> 42:40.640
Forty percent of our rent goes to this.

42:40.720 --> 42:44.040
[in Norwegian]   We've signed up
for Norway's Nicest Yard.

42:44.120 --> 42:45.960
There are obligations.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.280
It is a lot, now, isn't it, Einar?

42:51.720 --> 42:57.320
We spend that money more wisely,
hire help, get rid of the  dugnads.

42:57.400 --> 42:59.480
[in Norwegian]
That sounds rather nice.

42:59.560 --> 43:01.920
Cancel the clean-up?

43:02.000 --> 43:04.880
It'll be without me
on the board if that's the case.

43:05.840 --> 43:09.960
Maybe it would be a good idea to get
in some fresh blood?

43:10.040 --> 43:14.160
[man 2] Henriksen, here, seems like
a natural leader type.

43:41.960 --> 43:44.640
[in English]
Wakey wakey, Frankie boy.

43:45.800 --> 43:47.720
Shit! It's not him.

43:47.800 --> 43:49.040
[in Norwegian] Wait!

43:51.920 --> 43:53.080
Hey!

43:53.160 --> 43:54.880
- Hey, hey! Calm down!
- Cocksucker!

43:54.960 --> 43:58.240
- Fuck off.
- Calm down, calm down, you fuck!

44:00.600 --> 44:05.320
Fucking asshole!
Fucking cocksucking son of a bitch!

44:05.400 --> 44:08.600
- I'm gonna fucking kill him!
- Come on! Come on!

44:14.520 --> 44:17.640
[in Norwegian]
So, a toast to the new chairman.

44:17.720 --> 44:20.760
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Henriksen.

44:21.880 --> 44:24.680
[The Breakers' "Start the Show" playing]
