00:02.003 --> 00:04.003
(grinding)

00:12.146 --> 00:14.146
¶¶

00:34.301 --> 00:36.335
¶¶

00:46.447 --> 00:49.381
(children laugh, scream)

01:03.798 --> 01:05.831
(lights buzzing)

01:28.756 --> 01:32.858
Why are you always mixing
with the outsiders?

01:32.860 --> 01:36.395
She was a fan of the show.
She liked the act.

01:36.397 --> 01:40.099
Wanted to see
my grand finale.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.633
(laughs)

01:41.635 --> 01:45.170
Eh, he's a drunk.
He won't remember
anything in the morning.

01:45.172 --> 01:47.873
Oh, I'll remember,
you dried-up cunt.

01:47.875 --> 01:51.643
I remember everything.
I still use my head.

01:51.645 --> 01:53.378
That's the problem.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.581
You keep using the wrong
goddamn head!

01:55.583 --> 01:57.449
Bah!

01:57.451 --> 02:00.719
Baby, it's okay.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.655
A man has to release
his manhood sometimes.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.492
He's just doing
what he's built to do.

02:06.494 --> 02:09.261
He's feeding
his ancestors.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.697
I don't mind if he goes out
and plays with 'em.

02:11.699 --> 02:15.901
But why does he have to bring
these whores back here?!

02:15.903 --> 02:19.638
We got rules for a reason.
And, you know what?

02:19.640 --> 02:21.607
If we're gonna influence
the others,

02:21.609 --> 02:24.443
we need to
keep them here with us.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.445
We got to keep
this all quiet.

02:29.750 --> 02:34.453
Baby, am I sensing a little
of the green-eyed monster?

02:34.455 --> 02:36.488
-Don't you start with me.
-(laughing)

02:36.490 --> 02:38.690
-Don't you start with me.
-Is mommy getting jealous?

02:38.692 --> 02:40.926
-Stop that now! You stop that!
-Mama's getting jealous.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.928
-Mama's getting jealous.
-I'm not one of those whores!

02:42.930 --> 02:45.664
-Now knock it off!
-Whore?!

02:45.666 --> 02:48.500
-Where's there a whore?
Let me at her.
-(girl giggles)

02:48.502 --> 02:51.737
I think we have
a little visitor.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.374
-Uncle Joey.
-Hey.

02:55.376 --> 02:58.610
I'm sorry.
I had a bad dream.

02:58.612 --> 03:01.180
And then I heard
someone screaming.

03:01.182 --> 03:03.715
So I came downstairs.

03:03.717 --> 03:08.187
Kat, what did we tell you
about coming down here?

03:08.189 --> 03:10.222
Oh, leave her alone.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.257
She ain't hurting no one.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.194
Look at her.
She's just a little kid.

03:15.196 --> 03:17.729
You kinky little man.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.598
Who's that?

03:19.600 --> 03:21.967
Uh...

03:21.969 --> 03:26.438
This, Kat,
this is an outsider.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.240
(screams)

03:28.242 --> 03:30.842
What the fuck, baby, Joey?
Un-fucking-tie me!

03:30.844 --> 03:33.245
Uh...

03:34.415 --> 03:37.316
And this, Kat...

03:37.318 --> 03:39.251
-(screaming)
-...this... (laughs)

03:41.655 --> 03:45.257
This is what we do
to outsiders.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.658
Hey, no, no!
Not in front of Kat!

03:46.660 --> 03:48.327
-No, no!
-(grunts)

03:48.329 --> 03:50.762
Give her to me.
Give her to me. Watch.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.931
(hammer thudding)

04:10.684 --> 04:13.552
(sinister laughter)

04:44.018 --> 04:47.352
Woman:
Well, I almost died.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.288
How the hell should I know?

04:49.290 --> 04:50.789
Of course I'm okay.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.492
How the fuck would I be
calling if I wasn't okay?

04:53.494 --> 04:56.662
No, I'm not gonna
fucking calm down, okay?!

04:56.664 --> 04:58.730
I'm stranded in
the middle of nowhere.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.465
I practically almost died.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.502
This guy came out of nowhere
and I didn't hit him.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.504
That's why I'm in
this predicament.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.839
It's raining and it's
fucking pitch-black out.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.474
(crying)

05:09.476 --> 05:12.411
No, I'm gonna stay
strapped in until help comes.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.647
What happened to the guy?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.449
How the hell should I know?

05:17.451 --> 05:19.451
He was here one second
and gone the next.

05:19.453 --> 05:21.553
(groans)

05:21.555 --> 05:24.056
I can't see a goddamn thing
in this weather.

05:24.058 --> 05:27.826
-(crunching)
-Shh. Did you hear that?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.636
(grunts, panting)

05:39.073 --> 05:41.606
(screams)
Oh, my-- No!

05:41.608 --> 05:43.675
I'm okay. I'm just wet.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.744
Hello?
Oh, god damn it!

05:45.746 --> 05:47.879
Fuck! Oh, my God!

05:47.881 --> 05:49.348
Is someone there?

05:56.590 --> 05:58.690
(screams)

06:04.631 --> 06:06.631
(sighs)

06:29.923 --> 06:31.923
Creepy.

06:38.665 --> 06:41.032
(sighs)

07:24.711 --> 07:26.845
Not a scratch.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.216
I'm a fucking rock star.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.831
¶¶

07:59.580 --> 08:01.780
Did you move on me?

08:05.953 --> 08:07.752
-(beeps)
-(line ringing)

08:07.754 --> 08:09.788
(sighs)

08:19.867 --> 08:21.900
Typical.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.503
God, I could
really use a drink.

08:24.505 --> 08:26.972
And, of course, there's
no minibar in the funhouse.

08:38.919 --> 08:41.119
God, I love me!

08:46.293 --> 08:48.293
Oh, yes.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.894
Now that I've had
this life-changing event,

09:22.896 --> 09:25.664
I'm so over you, Ryan.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.301
But you're still buying me
that brand-new car.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.064
-(gasps)
-(sinister laughter)

10:00.934 --> 10:02.000
(grunts)

10:04.938 --> 10:06.838
That's what you get,
you little perv!

10:09.676 --> 10:12.177
(chuckling)

10:16.149 --> 10:18.083
(screams)

10:19.186 --> 10:21.186
(spluttering)

10:51.218 --> 10:53.218
(piano playing)

11:00.360 --> 11:03.194
Always a bridesmaid,
never a bride.

11:07.434 --> 11:10.235
Oh, my gosh!
There she is,
our princess!

11:11.838 --> 11:13.805
And you're
just in time.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.408
Actually, you're like
three chapters too late,

11:16.410 --> 11:18.343
-but you do look
like a princess.
-Mm-hmm.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.045
Sorry.

11:20.047 --> 11:23.048
That dress looks
perfect on all of you.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.917
-You're so beautiful.
-Yes, she is.

11:25.919 --> 11:28.353
She's the future
Mrs. Ferguson.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.789
-Aw!
-Hey, baby.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.226
You look just like
James Bond in that suit.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.961
(British accent)
Why thank you, my darling.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.763
(both laugh)

11:38.765 --> 11:40.432
I thought you
ran off on me.

11:40.434 --> 11:42.767
Not in a million years,
Tommy bear.

11:42.769 --> 11:44.235
(squeals)

11:44.237 --> 11:45.737
Okay.

11:48.141 --> 11:52.143
We are reunited
and it feels so good.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.013
But the thrill of flirting with
old minister is wearing thin,

11:55.015 --> 11:58.750
and unless Tommy bear over here
forks over another 50,

11:58.752 --> 12:00.351
let's get the show
on the road.

12:00.353 --> 12:03.354
-Mia, it is
her wedding day, okay?
-Ow.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.790
I'm saying, be a little
more sacred, that's all.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.193
There is a drive-thru at
the back of the building.

12:08.195 --> 12:10.128
See? That's why
I don't understand.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.396
Why'd you make her
the maid of honor?
I'm just saying.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.897
-Oh, my God!
-I'm just saying.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.165
Here we go.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.267
Oh, my God.
What, Nicole?

12:16.269 --> 12:19.404
Nothing.
I'm Switzerland.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.840
-What does that even mean?
-It means she's neutral.

12:21.842 --> 12:23.241
That doesn't even
make any sense.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.410
You either agree
or you disagree.
Can you shut up?

12:25.412 --> 12:28.947
Remember we said that
we weren't going to do this?

12:28.949 --> 12:30.849
Babe?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.951
-What?
-Thomas: Yeah, uh, hey.

12:32.953 --> 12:36.755
Well, I actually told
Carlee that she shouldn't
even have invited you guys.

12:36.757 --> 12:37.756
-Thomas.
-Mia: Wow.

12:37.758 --> 12:39.457
What?
No, no, no, no.

12:39.459 --> 12:43.294
I mean, okay, so here
we have the slutty one.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.764
-Wow.
-And over there

12:45.766 --> 12:48.433
we have the nerdy
kinda bangable girl
with the glasses,

12:48.435 --> 12:50.034
which I kinda like.

12:50.036 --> 12:53.805
But, you, oh, you...
No, no, no.

12:53.807 --> 12:58.977
-You are the needy,
desperate girl.
-Stop.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.012
-Hey, but you're
all equally annoying.
-Oh, my God.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.948
And after today,
we're going to be married,

13:03.950 --> 13:06.384
and we don't need
you bitches.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.386
-Whoa.
-Damn.

13:08.388 --> 13:12.357
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Unless one of you beautiful,

13:12.359 --> 13:15.260
fine ladies would like
to have dinner with me
this evening.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.428
Have you both
lost your mind?

13:17.430 --> 13:19.998
And could you quit
calling them "bitches"?

13:20.000 --> 13:22.133
-Jesus. Sorry.
-What?

13:22.135 --> 13:25.203
You said we're not
gonna do this anymore.

13:25.205 --> 13:28.840
Okay, what I meant was,
we're not going to
keep fighting--

13:28.842 --> 13:30.875
the girls aren't, and--

13:30.877 --> 13:32.577
Okay!

13:32.579 --> 13:34.379
The slutty one
thinks it's cool.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.914
Let's just
get you two married.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.081
-Great.
-Well, I have an idea.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.249
No, shut up.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.485
Hello? Remember me?

13:40.487 --> 13:42.587
(chuckles awkwardly)

13:42.589 --> 13:45.089
-Sorry.
-Thanks.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.860
(organ playing)

13:48.862 --> 13:52.230
This reminds me
of the proverb:

13:52.232 --> 13:55.533
"A slip of the foot,
you may recover,

13:55.535 --> 13:58.069
but a slip of the tongue,

13:58.071 --> 14:00.839
never, never."

14:00.841 --> 14:04.375
Okay, that's not the Bible.
That's Benjamin Franklin.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.277
Honey,
I'm trying, okay?

14:06.279 --> 14:08.413
And, you, ID?

14:08.415 --> 14:11.950
-Shit.
-No ID, no certificate.

14:11.952 --> 14:15.253
I left it in the car, babe.
I'm sorry.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.590
I'll go get it, okay?
Just relax, babe.

14:18.592 --> 14:22.093
Okay, we're fine, right, girls?
I'm sorry.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.063
It's okay, I'll get it.
Just relax. I'll be back.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.531
-Relax, huh.
-Okay.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.366
-We're good, right, girls?
-Yeah.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.368
Okay, I love you.
We're getting married.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.871
Okay, Miles,
can you just go get your--

14:32.873 --> 14:34.973
Thanks, babe.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.275
Sorry.

14:37.277 --> 14:40.411
You're getting married!

14:49.890 --> 14:52.056
(cell phone chimes)

14:54.127 --> 14:56.194
(chimes)

14:58.265 --> 14:59.898
(text message pings)

15:02.302 --> 15:04.369
Son of a bitch.

15:13.980 --> 15:18.082
<i> Priest:</i>
<i> Friends, we are gathered here</i>
<i> on this serious occasion</i>

15:18.084 --> 15:22.120
<i> to celebrate the union of two</i>
<i> souls coming together</i>

15:22.122 --> 15:26.024
<i> forever as one</i>
<i> for all of eternity.</i>

15:26.026 --> 15:29.560
The scriptures tell us
that love come forth

15:29.562 --> 15:32.931
like sunshine
after the rain.

15:32.933 --> 15:34.632
Not the Bible.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.001
That's Shakespeare.
Hello?

15:37.003 --> 15:40.238
Let's just get to it, okay?

15:40.240 --> 15:43.975
Do you, Carlee,
take Thomas to be
your husband,

15:43.977 --> 15:47.979
to love and cherish for
as long as you both shall live?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.416
I do.

15:51.418 --> 15:54.218
And how about you, Thomas,
do you take Carlee

15:54.220 --> 15:58.056
to be your wife for as long
as you both shall live?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.394
No.

16:03.396 --> 16:06.097
Not today.
Not ever.

16:06.099 --> 16:08.399
Come on, man.
Stop playing.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.301
Stop playing.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.104
Did you fucking cheat
on me last night?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.440
No. I--

16:15.442 --> 16:19.544
Well, yeah, but--
you said we had a pass.

16:19.546 --> 16:21.279
A fucking pass?!

16:23.416 --> 16:26.117
I should've known you're just
like your slutty friends.

16:26.119 --> 16:29.654
Stop calling them that.
I mean, you're gonna laugh
when I tell you.

16:29.656 --> 16:33.124
-It's--
-Really, Carlee,
I'm gonna laugh?

16:33.126 --> 16:35.326
You're hurtful.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.996
After everything
I have done for you,

16:37.998 --> 16:40.498
you are ungrateful.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.668
No, baby,
it's not like that.

16:43.670 --> 16:48.106
-I've put up with
this shit long enough.
-You don't mean that.

16:48.108 --> 16:50.141
You don't mean that.

16:50.143 --> 16:53.144
Yes, yes I do.

16:53.146 --> 16:55.546
We're done.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.516
This is it forever.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.020
I never want to
see you again.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.189
And when you get back,
all your shit will
be on the street.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.158
No, baby.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.561
What was I thinking
getting married to you?

17:10.563 --> 17:12.630
I have this dress
and all my friends--

17:13.767 --> 17:16.501
Just fucking leave.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.069
No.

17:18.071 --> 17:19.737
Just fucking leave.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.606
Hey, you know what? Come here.
You don't deserve this.

17:21.608 --> 17:24.609
Let's go. Come on. Come on.
It's okay. It's okay.

17:24.611 --> 17:27.045
You know what?
Super grateful this
is fucking over!

17:27.047 --> 17:29.313
-And take your slutty friend
with you, please.
-Fuck you.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.216
That's mean.

17:36.056 --> 17:38.056
¶¶

17:58.678 --> 18:01.579
That didn't go
very well.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.250
Look, I'm sorry.

18:06.252 --> 18:09.487
I'm not trying to be judgy,
but, I mean just wondering,

18:09.489 --> 18:12.356
like, why would you cheat
the night before your wedding?

18:12.358 --> 18:14.358
-Come on.
-Seriously?

18:14.360 --> 18:17.261
Yeah, I'm gonna
stay out of this.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.530
Yeah,
of course you would.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.301
I didn't cheat, okay?

18:24.704 --> 18:26.838
Okay, well,
not technically.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.241
¶¶

18:42.455 --> 18:45.223
Sorry it didn't work out.

18:47.127 --> 18:52.363
If you guys make up,
I'll do it next time
for half price.

18:52.365 --> 18:54.232
(scoffs)
Yeah.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.200
I just don't think
that's gonna happen.

18:56.202 --> 18:59.370
Look, man, there's a lot of
hot bitches out here.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.639
Let's just hit up
a strip club and get drunk.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.775
-We're in Sin City, baby.
-(cell phone chimes)

19:04.777 --> 19:06.844
Shit.
I still have her phone.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.714
Yo, don't look at it.
He's gonna send a dick pic.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.749
What? No, no.
Here, you take it.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.553
-(text message pings)
-Mm.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.722
Not bad. I like it.

19:19.592 --> 19:23.394
Hey, I got no problem.
My uncle's that way.

19:23.396 --> 19:28.399
You guys should see this.
Fantastic.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.568
I got a question.

19:30.570 --> 19:34.172
Uh, do you think it
looks like he would be...

19:34.174 --> 19:36.307
bigger than me?

19:36.309 --> 19:39.343
Not that I'm worried
or anything.

19:39.345 --> 19:41.445
Bigger than these?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.881
Oh, shit.

19:43.883 --> 19:46.817
Question number two, then,
and let's be honest.

19:46.819 --> 19:50.188
Why was I the only
one not invited to
the bachelorette, then?

19:50.190 --> 19:53.324
Because, Amber,
we knew how you'd be.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.426
Oh, and how is that?

19:56.796 --> 19:58.696
All right,
I love you, Amber,

19:58.698 --> 20:01.199
but if Mia would've told you
that we invited a stripper

20:01.201 --> 20:03.634
to the bachelorette party,
you would've freaked.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.470
-Fair?
-No.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.273
I think I would've
been cool with it.

20:09.275 --> 20:11.342
(laughing)
What?

20:11.344 --> 20:13.211
No, I can't even
stay quiet on that one.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.879
Really?

20:14.881 --> 20:17.281
(mutters)

20:17.283 --> 20:18.916
You know what?
You guys are bitches.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.952
Fine, okay?

20:20.954 --> 20:22.920
Yes, I think
it's a little weird

20:22.922 --> 20:25.456
that you had a stripper
at your bachelorette party.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.525
I mean, I've never
even met a stripper.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.761
-Oh, my God.
-What?

20:30.763 --> 20:32.697
I actually love you.

20:32.699 --> 20:35.633
You know what?
Shut up.

20:35.635 --> 20:38.669
Fine, okay, tell me.
Like, what's she even like?

20:39.639 --> 20:40.838
(camera shutter clicks)

20:40.840 --> 20:42.473
It's a girl.

20:42.475 --> 20:44.709
She was with
a girl last night.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.712
Wow.
Your girl just got hotter.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.947
-Right?
-Damn.

20:49.949 --> 20:52.984
Hey, that's my fiancée
you're talking about.

20:52.986 --> 20:54.819
God, I'm so stupid.

20:54.821 --> 20:57.355
Mia told me she was gonna
hire a stripper last night.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.556
(sighs)

20:58.558 --> 21:00.424
Big cans,
just like I like 'em.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.959
-Mm-hmm.
-Big titties.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.294
(laughter)

21:03.296 --> 21:04.262
Oh, my God, you guys.

21:04.264 --> 21:06.364
Okay. All right.

21:06.366 --> 21:08.933
So you're telling me,
just so I got this straight,

21:08.935 --> 21:13.771
that you weren't cheating--
you were having a fun romp

21:13.773 --> 21:15.773
with a stripper the night
before the wedding.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.644
Okay, first of all, one,
she wasn't exactly a stripper.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.712
I would call her
an adult entertainer.

21:21.714 --> 21:23.914
-Oh, please.
-What?

21:23.916 --> 21:25.783
That's what
the business card said.

21:25.785 --> 21:29.053
Two, Thomas and I
have an agreement

21:29.055 --> 21:32.690
that it's not considered
cheating if it's with a chick.

21:32.692 --> 21:36.594
Wow.
What planet is this?

21:36.596 --> 21:38.529
To quote the scriptures,

21:38.531 --> 21:40.398
you win some,
you lose some.

21:40.400 --> 21:43.067
Obviously you never read
a Bible before.

21:43.069 --> 21:46.070
All right, you got me.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.839
I just wanted
to stay in character.

21:48.841 --> 21:51.475
And, you know, you got
your money's worth.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.678
That's Vegas.

21:53.680 --> 21:56.480
We gotta go
get her back.

21:56.482 --> 21:58.416
We don't even know
where they went.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.584
I don't care.
We gotta get her back.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.486
There's only one road
out of Vegas, okay?

22:02.488 --> 22:04.088
It can't
be that difficult.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.456
Road trip.

22:05.458 --> 22:06.791
Yes!

22:06.793 --> 22:09.593
Oh, no. Not you.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.406
Okay, so if you and Thomas
have this great setup,

22:22.408 --> 22:23.941
you've been together
for seven years,

22:23.943 --> 22:25.509
why do you even
need to get married?

22:26.879 --> 22:29.880
I don't know.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.116
'Cause I can't imagine
a future without him.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.351
-Ugh.
-See?

22:33.353 --> 22:35.753
Because
he's Tommy bear.

22:36.756 --> 22:40.091
God,
he was such a dick.

22:40.093 --> 22:42.660
I can't even imagine
talking to him.

22:42.662 --> 22:45.529
That's good, because
you don't have your phone.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.833
Fuck.

22:48.835 --> 22:50.801
Well, it doesn't matter
anyway, because we don't
have any service.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.404
I've been checking
since we've left.
Trust me.

22:53.406 --> 22:56.474
And now we're gonna be stuck
in these ridiculous dresses.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.876
Hey, I love these dresses.

22:58.878 --> 23:02.446
-Thank you, Amber.
-Mm-hmm.

23:02.448 --> 23:05.649
You know what?
Let's just get out of Vegas
for a couple hours.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.485
It'll give me time to think,

23:07.487 --> 23:10.588
and there's a great spa
a couple hours

23:10.590 --> 23:12.156
in the middle
of the desert.

23:12.158 --> 23:15.659
They'll give us robes.
We won't need our cell phones.

23:15.661 --> 23:17.695
And, um...

23:20.800 --> 23:24.902
Thomas says that he is
really, really sorry.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.570
Well, then shit.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.905
All is forgiven then.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.173
-Yes.
-Yes.

23:29.175 --> 23:31.842
Okay.

23:58.137 --> 24:00.070
Where the fuck are we?

24:01.908 --> 24:03.941
I think I passed it.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.777
Why didn't you wake me up
and ask for directions?

24:10.516 --> 24:11.982
(growls)

24:11.984 --> 24:14.919
I just-- I thought I would
see it along the road.

24:17.523 --> 24:18.756
(growls)

24:18.758 --> 24:20.491
What the hell was that?

24:24.063 --> 24:25.496
I think
I'm seeing things.

24:25.498 --> 24:28.132
What is it?

24:28.134 --> 24:32.636
A-- A clown
in the middle of the desert
flipping us the bird.

24:32.638 --> 24:35.573
Oh, my God.
Honey, you really need
to lay off the shrooms.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.677
Are we there yet, guys?

24:39.679 --> 24:44.081
Uh, no.
Mia almost hit a clown,
and we're lost.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.050
Wait, what?
What time is it?

24:46.052 --> 24:47.852
It's dark o'clock.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.688
We are not lost.

24:50.690 --> 24:54.658
And my quick reflexes
saved wildlife from
crossing the road.

24:54.660 --> 24:57.161
Yeah. Wildlife.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.662
And we're lost.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.197
Okay,
but how can we be lost?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.867
It's literally
a one-way highway.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.835
Morning, sunshine.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.137
Just in time
to start bitching at me.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.873
I can't imagine
why you're single.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.608
(scoffs)
Fuck off, Mia.

25:10.610 --> 25:12.576
I'm literally pointing out
that if you used GPS

25:12.578 --> 25:15.112
-like a normal person...
-There's no signal out here.

25:15.114 --> 25:17.781
-(loud thud)
-(all scream)

25:17.783 --> 25:20.084
(car crashes)

25:28.794 --> 25:30.094
Well,
that's no frickin' bueno.

25:30.096 --> 25:33.764
Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.933
Well, we still don't
have service.

25:35.935 --> 25:38.269
Wait. Guys, look.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.205
Okay, it's a motel.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.640
So we could use their phone.

25:42.642 --> 25:45.910
I am not walking over there
in these heels.

25:45.912 --> 25:49.580
Then stay here
if you want to.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.583
Okay, I'm coming.

25:52.585 --> 25:55.185
Hey, I thought
we were on a truce.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.321
I'm sorry.
How's your head?

25:57.323 --> 25:59.056
It hurts.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.292
Of all the motels
in all the world,

26:01.294 --> 26:03.827
we just happen to break down
in front of the creepiest
motel ever.

26:03.829 --> 26:05.629
Mm-hmm.

26:05.631 --> 26:08.165
I mean, who even
builds a creepy motel
in the middle of nowhere

26:08.167 --> 26:12.336
besides a deranged lunatic?

26:12.338 --> 26:14.204
Guys,
it's not creepy.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.740
It's kinda kitschy.

26:16.742 --> 26:18.208
I'm pretty terrified.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.277
Gonna be okay.

26:20.279 --> 26:22.580
It's just a weird motel
in the middle of nowhere.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.882
Oh, thanks.
That helps.

26:29.121 --> 26:31.855
We all float down here.

26:31.857 --> 26:33.324
(laughter)

26:33.326 --> 26:35.993
-Stop!
-(laughter continues)

26:35.995 --> 26:37.728
Shh.

26:37.730 --> 26:40.197
(all chattering)

26:42.001 --> 26:43.701
-Oh, careful.
-Can't believe we're going

26:43.703 --> 26:45.169
in the clown motel...

26:53.913 --> 26:55.746
Okay, wow.

26:56.749 --> 26:58.882
Wow.

26:58.884 --> 27:01.051
Holy shit.

27:01.053 --> 27:04.021
This is so cool.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.025
Um, I'm scared.

27:08.027 --> 27:12.096
What do you ladies expect
from a Clown Inn?

27:12.098 --> 27:14.865
(circus music playing)

27:17.703 --> 27:19.403
(rings bell)

27:24.744 --> 27:27.311
Hello.

27:27.313 --> 27:29.146
Hello!

27:29.148 --> 27:31.115
Great, that's exactly
what you'd say

27:31.117 --> 27:33.317
before someone comes in
and brutally murders us all.

27:33.319 --> 27:37.087
-I heard you the first time!
-Okay.

27:37.089 --> 27:40.057
-Oh, my God.
-No need to get
your panties in a bunch.

27:40.059 --> 27:43.127
Now, what can I do for you?

27:43.129 --> 27:45.896
Just, uh, we'd, uh,
love to check into

27:45.898 --> 27:48.766
your love-- lovely inn.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.774
Fine.

27:56.776 --> 27:58.742
(whispers) Great.
What the fuck was that?

28:00.780 --> 28:02.913
I know, right?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.449
Where'd she go?

28:05.451 --> 28:07.251
I don't know.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.086
Okay.
(rings bell)

28:09.088 --> 28:10.721
Quit it. Stop it.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.475
Another dead soldier.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.179
I got you, homie.

28:38.951 --> 28:42.152
Yo, how far
are we gonna drive, man?

28:42.154 --> 28:44.455
They probably already
headed back to Vegas

28:44.457 --> 28:47.357
where we should be finding
new bitches.

28:47.359 --> 28:50.360
No. We would have
passed them

28:50.362 --> 28:51.962
if they were going
the opposite direction.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.300
Look, I gotta find her, okay?

28:56.302 --> 28:57.868
I gotta find her.

28:57.870 --> 29:01.371
I would never forgive myself
if I didn't.

29:01.373 --> 29:04.975
All right, chill out.
We'll find 'em.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.790
(sighs)

29:19.792 --> 29:23.193
Hey. Thanks.

29:25.898 --> 29:29.466
Thanks for being there.

29:29.468 --> 29:33.470
God, I just don't know how
things got so fucked up, man.

29:33.472 --> 29:38.242
Because bitches are crazy.

29:38.244 --> 29:42.513
For real. I mean, I'm down with
the hashtag "me too" and all,

29:42.515 --> 29:46.283
but bitches
are really fucking crazy.

29:48.554 --> 29:50.254
What do you know
about "me too"?

29:50.256 --> 29:52.523
Oh, I know.

29:52.525 --> 29:55.159
(scoffs)
I bet you know.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.261
(laughs)

30:03.068 --> 30:05.135
What the fuck?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.270
Oh, my...

30:06.272 --> 30:10.440
(faint calliope music)

30:10.442 --> 30:12.576
-What is that?
-Shit, man.

30:12.578 --> 30:14.144
Who is that?

30:14.146 --> 30:16.380
I'm sorry about
the "me too" comment.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.417
Fuck.

30:20.419 --> 30:22.920
¶¶

30:25.357 --> 30:28.125
Where the fuck is that
music coming from?

30:29.361 --> 30:31.195
That's the question
you're asking me?

30:31.197 --> 30:34.231
Yeah. That shit's creepy.

30:34.233 --> 30:38.902
Thomas:
How about, why there is
a big fucking clown there

30:38.904 --> 30:41.505
with a motherfucking rabbit?

30:43.175 --> 30:46.310
What is he about to do
with that bunny?

30:46.312 --> 30:49.913
Something tells me
we are about to find out.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.549
I don't fuck with clowns, man.
They scare the shit out of me.

30:54.553 --> 30:57.254
Let's get the fuck out of here.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.057
Okay...

31:02.228 --> 31:04.528
That's just some
creepy guy, okay?

31:04.530 --> 31:07.631
With fucking makeup
on his face.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.366
Relax.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.168
I don't think so.

31:11.170 --> 31:14.504
(maniacal laughter)

31:14.506 --> 31:16.506
Miles:
Oh, my fucking goodness.
Go, man.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.475
Get the fuck out of here.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.879
(engine sputtering)

31:21.881 --> 31:24.047
Stop playing, man!
That shit ain't funny.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.250
The car won't start, okay?

31:26.252 --> 31:27.484
(sputtering continues)

31:29.388 --> 31:31.922
Shit. Go! Go!

31:31.924 --> 31:34.491
Come on, man, stop playing!
This shit for real!

31:34.493 --> 31:37.027
Get out of here!
What the fuck, man!

31:37.029 --> 31:39.162
Let's go, let's go!

31:39.164 --> 31:42.633
-Shit!
-What the fuck? Let's go!

31:42.635 --> 31:44.434
Relax.

31:44.436 --> 31:47.004
(engine sputtering)

31:47.006 --> 31:49.539
-Hee hee hee!
-Oh, Jesus Christ!

31:49.541 --> 31:51.108
Just go!

31:52.544 --> 31:55.012
The car won't
fucking start!

31:55.014 --> 31:56.914
He wants me to roll
the window down.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.649
Let's get out of here!

32:00.619 --> 32:02.920
Come on! Come on!

32:05.424 --> 32:07.557
Where'd he go?

32:07.559 --> 32:10.694
Shit, man, this is just like
one of them horror movies.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.663
And guess who's
the first one to die?

32:12.665 --> 32:14.598
Me!

32:14.600 --> 32:17.267
This ain't a movie, and
you're not gonna die.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.539
Where did he go?

32:23.976 --> 32:26.543
(distant laughter)

32:26.545 --> 32:29.112
-What is that?
-I don't know.

32:29.114 --> 32:31.048
It's all around us.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.319
(Miles screams)

32:35.321 --> 32:37.387
(glass breaks)

32:41.460 --> 32:42.993
(clown grunts)

32:42.995 --> 32:44.628
(thuds on ground)

32:46.398 --> 32:49.333
You just knocked him out.

32:49.335 --> 32:52.069
Go check! Check!
Is he still down?

32:52.071 --> 32:53.270
Is he still there?!

32:53.272 --> 32:55.605
Fuck, all right. Shit.

33:00.379 --> 33:03.213
-Do you see him?
-I hear something.

33:03.215 --> 33:05.682
(flesh squelches)

33:05.684 --> 33:08.552
Miles, do you hear that? Miles!

33:08.554 --> 33:10.220
(distant laughter)

33:10.222 --> 33:13.156
Miles? Miles!

33:13.158 --> 33:16.226
Fuck! What the fuck!

33:16.228 --> 33:17.561
Fuck!

33:17.563 --> 33:20.097
We gonna go after him, Tiny?

33:20.099 --> 33:23.300
Nah, let the vultures
get him.

33:23.302 --> 33:26.436
(both laughing)

33:26.438 --> 33:28.739
Hey, Carlee,
I still don't have service.

33:28.741 --> 33:30.240
Will you see
if they have any Wi-Fi?

33:32.077 --> 33:35.112
Okay, but I highly doubt it.

33:36.582 --> 33:40.317
Excuse me,
do you have any Wi-Fi?

33:41.620 --> 33:44.187
Excuse me,
do you have any Wi-Fi?

33:44.189 --> 33:46.790
Why yes, yes we do.

33:46.792 --> 33:50.027
I have to get my daughter
to turn it on, she's a wiz

33:50.029 --> 33:52.429
at that um-- um, um--

33:52.431 --> 33:54.431
that computer stuff.

33:54.433 --> 33:58.168
You kids these days, you just
think you know everything.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.272
Mia:
So, um...

34:02.274 --> 34:05.575
Um, so, what do you girls
think of this place?

34:05.577 --> 34:08.678
I think it's kind of creepy.

34:08.680 --> 34:12.182
And Myrtle over there
is one taco short
of a combination plate.

34:12.184 --> 34:13.717
But I think we should
stay the night.

34:13.719 --> 34:15.786
Yeah, she's been
hitting the sauce,

34:15.788 --> 34:17.287
I can smell it
on her breath.

34:17.289 --> 34:19.122
Of course.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.424
-I'd be drunk every day
if I was living here.
-True.

34:20.426 --> 34:22.759
Um, hello?
I vote we don't stay.

34:22.761 --> 34:24.494
I think it's really scary.

34:24.496 --> 34:27.064
I think we should
call an Uber
and get out of here.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.266
Babe, this place
is harmless.

34:29.268 --> 34:32.369
I'll protect you from
anything that tries to get
near your panties tonight.

34:32.371 --> 34:35.705
But FYI,
Uber's not gonna drive
all the way out here

34:35.707 --> 34:38.308
-just to pick us up.
-True.

34:38.310 --> 34:41.545
Oh, but Carlee,
you could call Thomas.

34:41.547 --> 34:43.346
Just saying.

34:43.348 --> 34:46.716
Okay, new plan.
We stay here...

34:46.718 --> 34:48.785
for the night,

34:48.787 --> 34:51.488
and then we get the car
fixed in the morning,

34:51.490 --> 34:54.691
and we let everything
kind of blow over.

34:54.693 --> 34:57.828
Besides, you guys will get
your money out of your dresses.

34:57.830 --> 35:00.297
Yeah, 'cause
they're so comfy.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.732
Yeah, well, it's dark.
It's the logical thing to do.

35:02.734 --> 35:05.669
Yeah. Think of it
as an adventure.

35:05.671 --> 35:08.338
Okay.

35:08.340 --> 35:10.640
We're gonna laugh about this
when we're older.

35:10.642 --> 35:13.477
We are older.

35:13.479 --> 35:18.315
Hi, I'm Kat. My mom tells me
you want to use the Wi-Fi.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.384
-Oh, good.
-I just turned it back on.

35:21.386 --> 35:25.122
We don't like to keep it on
at night 'cause some customers

35:25.124 --> 35:27.624
like to surf porn.

35:27.626 --> 35:30.627
Porn is a sin!

35:30.629 --> 35:34.464
People fornicatin'
so others can watch.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.199
It's punishable.

35:36.201 --> 35:37.901
Punishable!

35:39.304 --> 35:41.838
-Oh.
-Wow.

35:44.176 --> 35:46.443
I hear you want two rooms?

35:46.445 --> 35:49.379
Yeah. Two rooms, two beds.

35:49.381 --> 35:52.582
Sure. I'll put you
right next to each other.

35:55.888 --> 35:58.622
(keyboard keys clacking)

36:08.367 --> 36:09.733
Thanks.

36:11.937 --> 36:14.204
Uh...

36:18.177 --> 36:20.944
Uh, okay. Let's go.

36:20.946 --> 36:24.247
-Your rooms are upstairs
and around the corner.
-All right.

36:24.249 --> 36:26.449
Sleep tight.

36:26.451 --> 36:28.318
Thanks, Kat.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.595
Oh, my God.

36:38.597 --> 36:44.434
These beds are made
for small people.

36:44.436 --> 36:47.938
Oh. There must be
a mix-up in the room.

36:47.940 --> 36:51.308
These beds
are for little kids.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.610
(sighs)

36:56.582 --> 36:58.715
(Mia laughing)
This is ridiculous!

36:58.717 --> 37:01.284
They gave us clown beds.

37:01.286 --> 37:03.887
-(door opens)
-Oh, my God. They gave
you guys the same thing.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.722
-(laughs)
-Gross.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.224
Gross.

37:08.627 --> 37:10.860
-This is bullshit.
-Yeah!

37:10.862 --> 37:13.763
I am going to smoke.
You in?

37:13.765 --> 37:16.233
No, no, no, no, no.

37:16.235 --> 37:20.470
Guys, I'm really tired.
Honesty, today's been
really scary.

37:20.472 --> 37:22.806
I'm gonna go to bed,
and I'm really hoping
when I wake up,

37:22.808 --> 37:25.542
this whole nightmare's over.
This is scary.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.378
-Goodnight!
-Goodnight.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.314
(British accent)
Well, I'm going to
take a bath

37:31.316 --> 37:33.617
because we missed the spa.

37:33.619 --> 37:36.686
Just to have a little
sex session, if you
know what I mean.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.257
Oh, yeah.
You, you're up.

37:40.259 --> 37:43.560
Yeah, yeah, I'll be down
in a bit. I'm just trying
to find service.

37:43.562 --> 37:45.829
I just haven't got it yet.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.897
Don't go on any porn.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.966
You don't want Myrtle
the turtle to see.

37:49.968 --> 37:53.536
(laughs)
Myrtle the turtle.

37:53.538 --> 37:55.505
Bye!

37:55.507 --> 37:59.943
Ah. This is actually
super comfortable.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.979
(crickets chirping)

38:31.810 --> 38:34.344
Mm.

38:34.346 --> 38:36.546
Thomas would love this.

39:01.373 --> 39:03.973
(owl hooting)

39:14.820 --> 39:16.386
(leaves crunch)

39:16.388 --> 39:18.088
(faint giggling)

39:21.793 --> 39:23.693
(footsteps)

39:23.695 --> 39:25.695
Mia?

39:36.508 --> 39:38.608
Mia Pia?

39:47.519 --> 39:49.853
Amber?

40:00.031 --> 40:01.965
Amber?

40:06.938 --> 40:08.738
(screams)

40:08.740 --> 40:10.440
(laughs)
Oh, my God.

40:10.442 --> 40:12.675
(screaming)

40:12.677 --> 40:14.844
Dude, your face!
I'm so sorry.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.946
Not funny.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.616
I was looking for reception
in the room and I still
couldn't find it.

40:19.618 --> 40:21.951
You scared the shit
out of me.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.754
I was trying to have a nice
moment out here. Fuck.

40:24.756 --> 40:27.123
Oh, yeah,
I love cemeteries too.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.993
I'm talking about
the stars, dumbass.

40:29.995 --> 40:31.528
Fucking stars.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.966
Well, we all
gotta go sometime.

40:36.968 --> 40:39.969
Yeah, that's what
freaks me out.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.941
Aren't you just
like a little curious

40:44.943 --> 40:48.011
about what goes on
on the other side?

40:48.013 --> 40:51.681
No, Nicole I'm not.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.983
Fuck.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.134
Thanks, girl.

41:20.078 --> 41:21.211
Hey!

41:23.148 --> 41:24.981
There's something out there.

41:44.870 --> 41:46.970
Hello?

41:53.078 --> 41:54.944
What are you
doing out here?

41:54.946 --> 41:57.514
Oh, I'm just
having a smoke.

41:57.516 --> 41:59.582
Is that what I think it is?

41:59.584 --> 42:01.284
Uh, yeah.
Is that okay?

42:01.286 --> 42:04.654
Yes. Can I?

42:04.656 --> 42:06.856
Yeah! Here,
take the whole thing.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.825
Oh, I just want a drag.

42:08.827 --> 42:12.262
No, trust me,
there's plenty
where that came from.

42:18.136 --> 42:21.271
Are you one of those
runaway brides?

42:21.273 --> 42:24.541
Yeah-- How--

42:24.543 --> 42:27.777
The dress. Yeah.

42:27.779 --> 42:30.046
No, I'm just an idiot.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.181
He was gonna marry you?

42:32.183 --> 42:33.917
Yeah.

42:33.919 --> 42:36.619
So it was serious?

42:36.621 --> 42:39.155
You know, I was late
for my own wedding.

42:40.659 --> 42:44.827
I just left him standing
there at the altar.

42:44.829 --> 42:47.730
I should have stayed
and like, fought for him.

42:50.201 --> 42:53.336
Well, you're gonna need
a new dress now, though.

42:53.338 --> 42:56.272
It's still the prettiest
dress I've ever seen.

42:56.274 --> 43:00.143
Thanks. I got it for
50 bucks at Goodwill.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.078
You're kidding.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.581
Yeah, I'm like
a bargain shopper.

43:04.583 --> 43:07.183
Just like my momma.
She's a coupon cutter

43:07.185 --> 43:08.952
and a bargain bin picker.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.720
Yeah, my mom too.

43:10.722 --> 43:12.655
That must have been
where I got it from.

43:12.657 --> 43:15.325
She died
when I was a kid though.

43:15.327 --> 43:18.027
Oh, that's--
that's too bad.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.296
Yeah. Fuckin' life.

43:25.670 --> 43:27.670
Must be pretty boring
for you out here.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.974
You're so pretty.

43:30.976 --> 43:32.742
You got a boyfriend?

43:32.744 --> 43:34.978
Well, no.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.914
I'm not allowed
to talk to them.

43:37.916 --> 43:40.383
My parents say boys are bad.

43:40.385 --> 43:43.119
I like them though.

43:43.121 --> 43:45.321
You're kidding?

43:47.692 --> 43:50.293
Shit, so...

43:50.295 --> 43:52.228
you're telling me you've
never been with a boy?

43:52.230 --> 43:55.298
Have you... been...
with your boy?

43:55.300 --> 43:58.234
(laughs)

43:58.236 --> 44:00.637
Yeah, I've been with him

44:00.639 --> 44:01.938
and a couple other boys,

44:01.940 --> 44:04.240
and some girls, too.

44:06.311 --> 44:08.411
I wish I was more like you.

44:09.314 --> 44:11.314
Yeah?

44:11.316 --> 44:13.149
How so?

44:13.151 --> 44:16.352
You just seem so strong
and confident.

44:18.790 --> 44:21.190
Thanks, Kat.

44:21.192 --> 44:24.761
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

44:24.763 --> 44:26.729
God, I don't
feel like that lately.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.866
I'll take the compliment.

44:29.868 --> 44:32.935
There is one boy
in this town I like,

44:32.937 --> 44:35.004
but he's too immature.

44:35.006 --> 44:36.673
Oh, yeah?

44:36.675 --> 44:39.809
Well, most boys are.

44:39.811 --> 44:41.310
And you know what?

44:41.312 --> 44:44.013
They don't ever
grow up, anyway.

44:44.015 --> 44:45.782
His name is Matthew.

44:45.784 --> 44:48.117
He's been trying
to get with me, but...

44:48.119 --> 44:50.053
I have to keep him
from my parents.

44:54.259 --> 44:56.125
How old are you?

44:56.127 --> 44:57.393
Twenty-four.

44:57.395 --> 44:59.295
Just had my birthday
last month.

44:59.297 --> 45:03.032
You're 24 and you've
never been laid?

45:03.034 --> 45:07.303
You're quite the enigma.
You're so innocent.

45:07.305 --> 45:09.839
You wanna do something
fun tomorrow?

45:09.841 --> 45:12.809
-There's a hot springs
close by.
-Yeah?

45:12.811 --> 45:15.378
Yeah, you know what?
That's perfect.

45:15.380 --> 45:17.814
Actually, you know,

45:17.816 --> 45:19.382
that's what the girls
and I were gonna do,

45:19.384 --> 45:21.451
is go to a spa before
we ended up in this dump.

45:22.921 --> 45:26.089
Okay, no offense, but...

45:26.091 --> 45:27.990
Yeah, that'd be cool.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.992
-I'll tell 'em.
-I can take you guys.

45:29.994 --> 45:31.861
Matthew's
gonna be there, too.

45:31.863 --> 45:35.231
Ah-ha. All right,
I can see why you'd be there.

45:35.233 --> 45:38.101
You know...
you're smart.

45:39.337 --> 45:42.138
You know,
I gotta hit the hay.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.240
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Good night.

45:44.242 --> 45:46.776
-Here.
-Thanks again for this.

45:46.778 --> 45:49.345
Yeah, no problem.

45:49.347 --> 45:51.848
-Night!
-Good night.

46:17.008 --> 46:18.441
(door closes)

46:18.443 --> 46:20.810
Car?

46:20.812 --> 46:23.012
Is that you, babe?

46:24.415 --> 46:28.017
Mm. Sure was
a long smoke break.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.027
What the fuck?

46:38.029 --> 46:39.362
(screams)

46:39.364 --> 46:41.030
(laughing)

46:41.032 --> 46:43.032
(screams)

46:48.873 --> 46:50.907
(screams)

46:51.843 --> 46:55.144
Hey, Mia!
Wake up!

46:55.146 --> 46:57.580
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

46:57.582 --> 46:59.549
Here, I got you.

46:59.551 --> 47:01.551
Oh, my God,
you almost drowned.

47:01.553 --> 47:04.053
Oh, fuck.
Oh, my God.

47:05.557 --> 47:07.523
Wow, I just had
the worst nightmare.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.325
Yeah.

47:09.327 --> 47:13.029
These clowns were
trying to drown me.

47:15.466 --> 47:18.134
Wow, okay.

47:18.136 --> 47:20.303
Yeah. Holy shit.

47:21.873 --> 47:23.940
That was so real.

47:26.411 --> 47:30.580
I think it's just all these
clown pictures in this place.

47:30.582 --> 47:32.481
God, get me out of this tub.

47:38.523 --> 47:43.359
¶¶

48:04.215 --> 48:06.182
(groaning)

48:10.521 --> 48:12.488
Okay.

48:12.490 --> 48:16.058
I know what you'd say, Miles,
I know what you'd say:

48:16.060 --> 48:18.194
"You're gonna get those
motherfuckers, right?"

48:18.196 --> 48:20.396
(laughing)

48:28.673 --> 48:30.406
I'm supposed to--

48:30.408 --> 48:32.508
I'm supposed to
be getting married.

48:32.510 --> 48:34.543
The fucking clowns!

48:37.649 --> 48:40.416
I'm sorry, Miles.
I'm sorry, buddy.

48:40.418 --> 48:43.052
I'm fucking sorry.

48:43.054 --> 48:45.121
How the fuck am I here?

48:47.025 --> 48:48.524
Fuck.

48:49.694 --> 48:51.928
You wanna fuck with me?!

48:57.201 --> 48:59.502
All right, all right.

48:59.504 --> 49:02.338
All right, Miles.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.507
I'm gonna do this for you,
buddy.

49:05.977 --> 49:08.611
This is for you.
This is for you.

49:12.016 --> 49:13.382
(shouts)

49:13.384 --> 49:15.551
You fuckers!

49:17.455 --> 49:23.025
(maniacal laughter)

49:31.336 --> 49:34.503
Clown:
Come on, do it!

49:36.975 --> 49:39.709
(laughter)

49:43.982 --> 49:45.715
Yeah...

50:00.298 --> 50:02.398
You must be
willing to sacrifice

50:02.400 --> 50:04.433
for the brotherhood.

50:04.435 --> 50:06.502
-Through it, hey?
-Yeah.

50:06.504 --> 50:08.437
Hey, hey!

50:12.443 --> 50:14.443
(laughter)

50:18.516 --> 50:20.182
Fucking liar!

50:20.184 --> 50:22.184
I seen you, man.

50:22.186 --> 50:25.087
-I was--
-I'd do it all
for the brotherhood.

50:25.089 --> 50:27.089
-Let's spin.
-Uh-huh.

50:30.528 --> 50:33.629
Whoa-ho.

50:33.631 --> 50:36.298
(laughing)

50:36.300 --> 50:38.200
You shut up!

50:38.202 --> 50:40.703
I ain't afraid.

50:44.308 --> 50:46.575
Come on!

50:46.577 --> 50:48.778
Fucker's gonna
shoot himself. Fuck!

50:51.549 --> 50:54.450
(laughing)

50:56.454 --> 50:58.187
This is for you, Miles.

51:06.230 --> 51:07.530
Stupid clowns!

51:07.532 --> 51:09.298
(grunts)

51:15.273 --> 51:18.074
You guys are... crazy.

51:35.393 --> 51:37.159
This is for Miles!

51:41.532 --> 51:44.100
He didn't deserve to die!

51:47.572 --> 51:49.638
And this is just
for that rabbit!

51:53.311 --> 51:55.878
(grunting)

52:07.725 --> 52:09.425
Whoa! Oh!

52:09.427 --> 52:11.227
-(bones crack)
-Ahh!

52:22.907 --> 52:25.241
So, who are you?

52:25.243 --> 52:26.909
I take it you're
the big stupid clown?

52:27.612 --> 52:28.911
Oh!

52:30.548 --> 52:32.281
(chuckling)

52:32.283 --> 52:34.450
Shit!

52:34.452 --> 52:37.286
(groaning)

52:41.492 --> 52:44.426
You got spunk, kid,

52:44.428 --> 52:46.695
got to give you that.

52:46.697 --> 52:49.765
Don't you worry about
that little bunny.

52:49.767 --> 52:52.701
I got another bunny
in mind for you.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.637
(sighs)

52:54.639 --> 52:57.773
You boys. You fuckers!

52:57.775 --> 53:00.843
You're as useless
as tits on a bull!

53:00.845 --> 53:02.811
Now, get him inside!

53:05.850 --> 53:07.349
Now!

¶¶

53:42.653 --> 53:45.888
(car alarm blaring)

53:48.359 --> 53:50.292
Fuck.

53:51.729 --> 53:55.397
God, for a population
of fucking 5,

53:55.399 --> 53:57.766
there sure is a lot of
noise in the morning.

53:57.768 --> 54:02.004
(alarm blaring)

54:10.982 --> 54:12.681
Fuck.

54:14.285 --> 54:16.318
-What is wrong?
-My purse!

54:16.320 --> 54:18.921
-What?
-Oh, fuck.

54:18.923 --> 54:21.924
Where's my fucking keys?

54:21.926 --> 54:24.360
(muttering)

54:27.531 --> 54:29.665
(jangling)

54:29.667 --> 54:31.967
Did you forget that
I drove last night?

54:31.969 --> 54:33.702
Apparently.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.371
(alarm stops)

54:35.373 --> 54:37.039
Nice ass.

54:37.041 --> 54:38.674
Thanks.

54:57.061 --> 54:59.561
Hey, what are you doing?
That's my car!

54:59.563 --> 55:01.664
-Found it on the side
of the road.
-Yeah!

55:01.666 --> 55:03.832
Thought the owner
might be here.

55:03.834 --> 55:05.668
Yeah, well, we gotta
get back on the road.

55:05.670 --> 55:07.469
We gotta go.

55:07.471 --> 55:09.738
-Hello?
-If you lookie here,
your rim's all beat up,

55:09.740 --> 55:11.307
and you ain't got a spare,

55:11.309 --> 55:13.375
so I got to get you
another one.

55:13.377 --> 55:15.911
Yeah! Hey...

55:17.682 --> 55:19.982
Yeah, that makes sense.
Sorry. I'm just...

55:21.786 --> 55:24.920
Yeah, um, what did you say
your name was?

55:24.922 --> 55:27.523
Jebediah. But my friends
call me Jeb.

55:27.525 --> 55:29.792
(laughs)

55:29.794 --> 55:32.594
So does that make us
friends now, Jeb?

55:32.596 --> 55:33.929
Well, sure.

55:36.100 --> 55:39.601
So, uh, how long do you
think it's gonna take

55:39.603 --> 55:41.103
to get the car going?

55:41.105 --> 55:43.605
Out here, no telling.

55:43.607 --> 55:46.041
I gotta go to the junkyard,
find you a matching wheel.

55:47.545 --> 55:49.645
So, where's your shop, Jeb?

55:49.647 --> 55:51.780
Shop is just over yonder.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.515
Right over there.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.517
-Cool.
-That's a nice dress
you have there.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.586
Oh, thanks... Jeb.

55:57.588 --> 55:59.988
You wait at the hotel,
I'll let you know
when it's ready.

55:59.990 --> 56:01.957
All right.

56:01.959 --> 56:03.492
Bye.

56:17.108 --> 56:18.974
Ooh!

56:18.976 --> 56:21.377
You ready for spa day?

56:21.379 --> 56:23.679
Jeez, can't you wait,
Tits McGee?

56:23.681 --> 56:26.415
Whatever, it covers
the same as a bikini.

56:26.417 --> 56:28.150
-I told her, I did.
-She did.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.719
Okay, what is going on
with the car?

56:30.721 --> 56:34.022
Bad news, it needs a rim.

56:34.024 --> 56:36.024
Good news is,

56:36.026 --> 56:38.927
I found out who's gonna
give me my next rim job.

56:38.929 --> 56:42.131
-Oh, my God.
-Um, ew.

56:42.133 --> 56:44.466
-Oh, my God...
-Of course you did.

56:44.468 --> 56:46.568
Does this mean you're gonna
bail on us for our spa day?

56:46.570 --> 56:48.804
-Yeah.
-No.

56:50.007 --> 56:53.575
Whoa... Hello! Whoa.

56:53.577 --> 56:56.111
What do they say?

56:56.113 --> 56:58.814
¶ These boots are made
for walking ¶

56:58.816 --> 57:02.017
Oh, and I have these.

57:02.019 --> 57:04.686
You're like the cutest
little human ever.

57:04.688 --> 57:07.523
-Thank you, darling.
-Yeah, thank you.

57:09.660 --> 57:11.627
Now you almost look
like you belong.

57:11.629 --> 57:13.896
Except for the clown noses.

57:13.898 --> 57:16.865
-Shut up.
-Thank you, Kat.

57:16.867 --> 57:18.901
Thanks, Kat.

57:18.903 --> 57:21.537
Are we ready to party?

57:21.539 --> 57:22.971
In the spa?

57:22.973 --> 57:25.441
-Let's go!
-Yeah.

57:25.443 --> 57:29.812
¶¶

58:09.753 --> 58:13.555
(chattering, laughing)

58:13.557 --> 58:15.824
-You know what, guys?
-What?

58:15.826 --> 58:17.726
This is, like,
really fun.

58:17.728 --> 58:22.064
Oh, my God, Ambular
is actually having fun?

58:22.066 --> 58:24.633
Alert the media!

58:24.635 --> 58:27.135
You know,
I'm gonna take your fun
and I'm gonna one-up you,

58:27.137 --> 58:29.271
because I've been wearing
this dress for so long,

58:29.273 --> 58:31.540
I'm actually
starting to like it.

58:31.542 --> 58:34.643
Yeah, that's Kat's fault,
because she gave us these
cowboy boots

58:34.645 --> 58:36.879
and they make all
the dresses look perfect.

58:36.881 --> 58:38.113
True!

58:38.115 --> 58:40.549
This is my favorite
day ever, guys.

58:40.551 --> 58:43.252
I want you to keep
the boots as a present.

58:43.254 --> 58:46.054
No, we can't do that.

58:46.056 --> 58:48.524
Yes, you can, shoes are my
thing, I collect 'em.

58:48.526 --> 58:50.792
I have, like, 50 pairs.

58:50.794 --> 58:53.762
I love you so much.
You know what?
I love you so much

58:53.764 --> 58:56.565
that in fact, we are
going to wear these boots

58:56.567 --> 58:59.134
when I marry my new crush.

58:59.136 --> 59:01.169
And you're gonna be
in the wedding.

59:01.171 --> 59:03.539
Okay, no, no, no.

59:03.541 --> 59:06.241
I'm not gonna let you marry
a tow truck driver.

59:06.243 --> 59:08.744
Have you seen how
fucking hot he is, though?

59:08.746 --> 59:10.078
I agree with you,
actually.

59:10.080 --> 59:12.247
I know!

59:12.249 --> 59:16.018
Amber:
You know what, guys?

59:16.020 --> 59:17.920
-What is she doing?
-My name is Amber.

59:17.922 --> 59:19.955
(laughs)

59:24.061 --> 59:27.796
And from this day forward,
I will no longer be

59:27.798 --> 59:29.665
so uptight.

59:29.667 --> 59:32.000
I mean, you're not even
gonna recognize me...

59:32.002 --> 59:33.268
-Amber?
-Amber!

59:33.270 --> 59:34.636
Shh! I'm feeling myself
right now.

59:34.638 --> 59:37.005
I'm gonna be so crazy,
in fact...

59:38.776 --> 59:41.009
Whoo!

59:44.248 --> 59:46.815
Old Amber's dead!

59:50.087 --> 59:52.254
(siren blips)

59:52.256 --> 59:54.690
(clears throat)

59:54.692 --> 59:56.825
You girls aren't
from around here.

59:56.827 --> 59:58.694
It's kind of obvious,
isn't it?

59:58.696 --> 1:00:02.331
It's obvious we have
a situation of public indecency.

1:00:11.709 --> 1:00:12.975
Jesus.

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:19.214
-Hi, Officer O'M--
-(deputy laughing)

1:00:22.052 --> 1:00:24.186
Mia:
Is there something we can
help you with, Officer?

1:00:29.059 --> 1:00:31.159
Deputy:
You can.

1:00:32.997 --> 1:00:35.063
Your friend's gonna need
some toilet paper.

1:00:35.065 --> 1:00:37.065
Huh, Captain?

1:00:37.067 --> 1:00:39.768
Ain't that right?
(laughs)

1:00:41.138 --> 1:00:43.138
Pissing all over the street.
(laughing)

1:00:43.140 --> 1:00:45.340
Enough, Goodspeed.

1:00:50.681 --> 1:00:52.781
Surprised to
see you here.

1:00:54.752 --> 1:00:56.952
Sorry, Officer O'Malley.

1:00:56.954 --> 1:00:59.988
Just showing 'em Salt's Creek,
that's all.

1:00:59.990 --> 1:01:02.658
Just us silly girls
having some fun.

1:01:02.660 --> 1:01:04.426
No harm intended.

1:01:06.797 --> 1:01:08.930
(whispers)
This is bullshit.

1:01:08.932 --> 1:01:13.201
Well, Katie, if you
hang around with clowns,

1:01:13.203 --> 1:01:16.071
don't be surprised
if your life becomes a circus.

1:01:19.076 --> 1:01:21.309
Sorry to scare you girls,

1:01:21.311 --> 1:01:25.213
but we have a duty
to serve and protect.

1:01:25.215 --> 1:01:28.016
There's a lot of
unsavory people around here.

1:01:28.018 --> 1:01:30.952
(Goodspeed laughing)

1:01:30.954 --> 1:01:33.388
So keep your panties on.

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:35.691
(Goodspeed laughing continues)

1:01:35.693 --> 1:01:38.126
Don't mind him.
He's got a sick sense of humor.

1:01:41.231 --> 1:01:43.131
Come on, Goodspeed.

1:01:44.835 --> 1:01:46.802
Boys will be boys.

1:01:48.072 --> 1:01:50.305
Ladies.

1:01:50.307 --> 1:01:51.807
(car door opens)

1:01:53.744 --> 1:01:55.310
-(car door opens)
-I'm sorry.

1:01:56.980 --> 1:01:59.181
(engine starts)

1:02:09.760 --> 1:02:12.194
Fucking cops.
Pigs.

1:02:12.196 --> 1:02:15.230
Screw them.
We'll run around naked
if we want to!

1:02:15.232 --> 1:02:17.866
Tell us how to live?
What to do with these?

1:02:17.868 --> 1:02:20.001
You know what?
I'm gonna write a review.

1:02:20.003 --> 1:02:22.504
¶¶

1:03:18.395 --> 1:03:22.097
Ah, this is
amazing, Kat.

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:25.300
Best-kept secret in Tonopah.

1:03:27.938 --> 1:03:31.239
Yeah, this is way better
than a real spa.

1:03:31.241 --> 1:03:33.041
Yeah,
who needs Botox anyway

1:03:33.043 --> 1:03:35.043
when you have
a natural mud bath?

1:03:35.045 --> 1:03:37.279
(laughter)

1:03:37.281 --> 1:03:39.047
Okay, guys,
I need a hug.

1:03:39.049 --> 1:03:40.148
-No. No.
-No.

1:03:40.150 --> 1:03:42.050
-Carlee?
-Screw off.

1:03:42.052 --> 1:03:44.052
-Come on. Give me a hug.
Give me a hug.
-No!

1:03:44.054 --> 1:03:46.288
(laughing)

1:03:46.290 --> 1:03:49.024
-(shushing)
-What?

1:03:49.026 --> 1:03:51.159
(screams)

1:03:52.930 --> 1:03:55.130
Show your face!
Get out here, pervert!

1:03:57.434 --> 1:04:00.202
Ew! Why are you
staring at us?

1:04:00.204 --> 1:04:02.237
Oh, no, ma'am.

1:04:02.239 --> 1:04:05.040
I-I just didn't know what to do
when I saw y'all naked.

1:04:05.042 --> 1:04:08.009
First of all,
not all of us are naked.

1:04:08.011 --> 1:04:09.578
Kat:
It's okay, it's okay.
He's my friend.

1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:11.913
-I invited him here.
-Hi, Kat.

1:04:11.915 --> 1:04:13.381
Hi.

1:04:15.052 --> 1:04:18.086
-That's Matthew.
-Oh, this is her boyfriend.

1:04:18.088 --> 1:04:20.422
Okay.

1:04:29.933 --> 1:04:32.100
I wasn't expecting you
for another few hours.

1:04:32.102 --> 1:04:33.501
I'm sorry.

1:04:33.503 --> 1:04:36.872
I finished my chores early
and came right over.

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:38.974
That's okay.
I'm glad you're early.

1:04:38.976 --> 1:04:40.876
These are my friends.

1:04:40.878 --> 1:04:42.043
-They're staying at
the Clown Inn.
-Hi.

1:04:42.045 --> 1:04:44.446
Kat:
I'm just showing them around.

1:04:44.448 --> 1:04:47.983
Y'all, uh,
y'all like it there?

1:04:47.985 --> 1:04:50.485
Where?

1:04:50.487 --> 1:04:54.522
Oh, the Clown Inn. You know,
with all the smoking and stuff?

1:04:54.524 --> 1:04:58.493
Yeah, you sure do like
your clowns around here.

1:04:58.495 --> 1:05:01.496
-(laughter)
-What's with that stuff anyway?

1:05:01.498 --> 1:05:04.032
Oh, it's just all
urban legends and stuff.

1:05:04.034 --> 1:05:07.369
Your mom was always saying
it's more than just that.

1:05:07.371 --> 1:05:10.238
Well, she's always
saying a lot.

1:05:10.240 --> 1:05:14.609
-For God's sake, just spill.
-Yeah.

1:05:16.213 --> 1:05:21.049
That motel was built
on a cemetery.

1:05:21.051 --> 1:05:23.285
Which was the final
resting place

1:05:23.287 --> 1:05:26.221
of the Loretta
coalminer's plague.

1:05:26.223 --> 1:05:28.924
200 souls.

1:05:28.926 --> 1:05:32.027
All of the buried in
that there cemetery.

1:05:32.029 --> 1:05:37.499
The carnies came in and there
were these circus clowns, right?

1:05:37.501 --> 1:05:41.403
<i> And they were marrying</i>
<i> all the women of the dead,</i>
<i> you know, coalminers.</i>

1:05:41.405 --> 1:05:44.372
(crying)

1:05:50.580 --> 1:05:52.347
It's okay.

1:05:58.055 --> 1:06:00.155
What are we gonna do?

1:06:00.157 --> 1:06:02.657
He was everything to us.

1:06:05.062 --> 1:06:07.195
So many men have died.

1:06:08.565 --> 1:06:11.633
-We are cursed.
-No, we're not. It's okay.

1:06:11.635 --> 1:06:14.035
We have each other.

1:06:24.314 --> 1:06:27.749
-Betsy, who are those men?
-I don't know.

1:06:33.090 --> 1:06:36.157
(chuckles)

1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:53.174
-Stop it. Who are you?
-No. Stop.

1:06:53.176 --> 1:06:55.276
Stop.
Stay away from my sister.

1:06:55.278 --> 1:06:57.612
Hey! You better leave
those women alone.

1:06:58.615 --> 1:07:01.082
-No! No!
-(screaming)

1:07:01.084 --> 1:07:02.717
-(bone cracks)
-No!

1:07:02.719 --> 1:07:06.187
Betsy, run! No!

1:07:06.189 --> 1:07:08.089
Get off of her!

1:07:08.091 --> 1:07:10.125
(screaming continues)

1:07:14.031 --> 1:07:16.264
Betsy, run!

1:07:18.201 --> 1:07:20.368
No! (crying continues)

1:07:27.377 --> 1:07:31.379
Some people believe
if you stop catering

1:07:31.381 --> 1:07:33.581
to their ancestors,

1:07:33.583 --> 1:07:36.051
the clowns,

1:07:36.053 --> 1:07:39.654
boy, they say they sure did
love their booze,

1:07:39.656 --> 1:07:42.724
cigarettes,
and all the clown nonsense.

1:07:42.726 --> 1:07:44.659
Oh, oh, and the women.

1:07:44.661 --> 1:07:48.129
Ooh.
Lots and lots of women.

1:07:48.131 --> 1:07:52.834
And if you ever broke
the code of the clown,

1:07:52.836 --> 1:07:56.271
you'll come down
with a painful death.

1:07:57.507 --> 1:08:00.742
(chuckles)
If you haven't noticed,

1:08:00.744 --> 1:08:04.312
a lot of smokers
and drinkers in this town.

1:08:04.314 --> 1:08:06.381
Ain't much else to do.

1:08:06.383 --> 1:08:09.284
It became almost like

1:08:09.286 --> 1:08:11.619
some weird religion.

1:08:15.859 --> 1:08:20.562
Then the whole thing
got real cult like.

1:08:20.564 --> 1:08:24.566
And now since that outsider
killed Tiny Clown's twin,

1:08:24.568 --> 1:08:28.803
he and Big Clown ain't ever

1:08:28.805 --> 1:08:32.440
-remove their clown make-up.
-Okay, Matthew, that's enough.

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:35.343
They don't need
to hear any more.

1:08:35.345 --> 1:08:38.346
I thought you said
they were your friends,

1:08:38.348 --> 1:08:40.315
not outsiders.

1:08:42.652 --> 1:08:45.453
On that note,
I'm out of here.

1:08:45.455 --> 1:08:47.889
Good to meet you, Matthew.

1:08:47.891 --> 1:08:51.726
Yeah, um, I'm gonna, too.

1:08:51.728 --> 1:08:54.896
Sorry. Bye.

1:08:54.898 --> 1:08:56.731
Where are they going?

1:08:58.268 --> 1:09:00.368
(chatter)

1:09:02.139 --> 1:09:04.539
Okay, yeah, let's split, too,
'cause I'm starving.

1:09:04.541 --> 1:09:07.242
No, no, no, no, no.
I wanna stay in the grotto.

1:09:07.244 --> 1:09:09.911
There's no way I'm going back
to that clown motel

1:09:09.913 --> 1:09:13.181
slash cemetery
slash 200 dead coalminers.

1:09:13.183 --> 1:09:15.316
Amber, get out.

1:09:15.318 --> 1:09:17.785
So nice to meet you.
Come on.

1:09:17.787 --> 1:09:22.157
-Nice to meet you, too.
-Thanks for this
lovely spa time.

1:09:22.159 --> 1:09:23.658
See you guys later.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:26.261
Well, scared them off.

1:09:28.698 --> 1:09:30.498
Well...

1:09:30.500 --> 1:09:32.734
Don't you feel like Kat
could do way better?

1:09:32.736 --> 1:09:34.602
Well, it's slim pickings
out here.

1:09:34.604 --> 1:09:36.437
You just take
what you can get.

1:09:36.439 --> 1:09:39.274
Yeah, it's slim pickings
in a clown town

1:09:39.276 --> 1:09:41.809
where they smoke
to keep the spirits away

1:09:41.811 --> 1:09:44.612
and there's one tiny
pissed off clown?

1:09:44.614 --> 1:09:47.182
It kinda reminds me of
that weird story, right,

1:09:47.184 --> 1:09:49.417
where that lady has to keep
rebuilding her mansion

1:09:49.419 --> 1:09:51.786
to keep that
weird spirit happy.

1:09:51.788 --> 1:09:54.556
Oh, yeah, yeah. What's--
Winchester Mystery House.

1:09:54.558 --> 1:09:57.725
-Ding-ding.
-Thank you, Alex Trebek.

1:09:57.727 --> 1:10:01.496
(sighs) By the way,
I'm fucking hating this dress.

1:10:03.333 --> 1:10:05.967
Yeah, I'm gonna cut mine
into like 6,000 pieces.

1:10:05.969 --> 1:10:08.436
Hell no. I'm giving mine
to Carlee for her birthday.

1:10:08.438 --> 1:10:10.939
That's a good idea.
Wait.

1:10:24.221 --> 1:10:26.955
Did you guys just see
what I saw?

1:10:26.957 --> 1:10:29.724
Weird rapey cop
who made Amber pee

1:10:29.726 --> 1:10:33.428
and Baby Huey both
wearing clown noses?

1:10:33.430 --> 1:10:35.463
That would be a "yep."

1:10:35.465 --> 1:10:37.398
Yeah, so I think now
we should get Carlee

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:39.334
-and get the fuck out of here.
-Great. Let's do that.

1:10:39.336 --> 1:10:41.936
-Yeah.
-And I only tinkled,
by the way.

1:10:42.872 --> 1:10:44.973
Okay.

1:10:46.576 --> 1:10:49.010
Oh, Matthew,
you're so aggressive.

1:10:49.012 --> 1:10:51.613
-What's gotten into you?
-Oh, sorry.

1:10:51.615 --> 1:10:55.450
Seeing everybody naked
got me kind of excited.

1:10:58.321 --> 1:11:00.655
(Matthew exclaiming)

1:11:07.831 --> 1:11:09.864
It's okay, baby,
I've heard about this before.

1:11:09.866 --> 1:11:11.666
-No!
-Sometimes it just happens.

1:11:11.668 --> 1:11:14.269
-Oh, no! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
-We can try again later--

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:16.638
(Kat screaming)

1:11:16.640 --> 1:11:18.640
-Matthew: No! No!
-No, Daddy, please!

1:11:18.642 --> 1:11:21.442
-Please don't hurt him!
I love him!
-He's not part of the clan.

1:11:21.444 --> 1:11:23.311
-You know that, Kat.
-No, baby!

1:11:23.313 --> 1:11:24.812
Matthew:
It's not her fault, sir.

1:11:24.814 --> 1:11:26.681
Kat:
No! Get off!

1:11:26.683 --> 1:11:28.516
You're right, Matthew.

1:11:28.518 --> 1:11:30.351
It's not her fault.

1:11:31.821 --> 1:11:33.921
-It's yours.
-No!

1:11:44.768 --> 1:11:46.567
Kat:
No, Daddy!

1:11:46.569 --> 1:11:48.836
All these rules!

1:11:48.838 --> 1:11:50.872
All these traditions!

1:11:50.874 --> 1:11:52.607
I hate it!

1:11:52.609 --> 1:11:55.877
Family knows best.

1:11:57.681 --> 1:12:00.415
Daddy's got you, sweetie.

1:12:00.417 --> 1:12:02.383
It's gonna be
all right, sis.

1:12:02.385 --> 1:12:04.485
(laughs)

1:12:10.927 --> 1:12:12.994
Jeb?

1:12:15.398 --> 1:12:17.065
Jeb?

1:12:23.973 --> 1:12:25.773
Hello?

1:12:32.582 --> 1:12:34.716
-(honk honk)
-(giggles)

1:12:39.856 --> 1:12:41.589
Hello?

1:12:53.370 --> 1:12:56.003
(gasping, screaming)

1:12:56.005 --> 1:12:58.373
Whoa there, lady.

1:12:58.375 --> 1:13:00.842
-Where you going?
-There's something--
there's--

1:13:00.844 --> 1:13:03.144
-there's something in there.
-No, no.

1:13:03.146 --> 1:13:05.980
That's, uh,
that's just Hank.

1:13:05.982 --> 1:13:09.450
It's a doll, you know?

1:13:09.452 --> 1:13:11.119
-Keep the bad spirits away.
-Yeah.

1:13:11.121 --> 1:13:13.154
(chuckles)

1:13:13.156 --> 1:13:16.891
-I thought that, um...
-I could tell what you thought.

1:13:16.893 --> 1:13:19.660
Get that dirt off
your pretty face.

1:13:19.662 --> 1:13:22.563
You know, the shop is
no place for a lady.

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:28.503
Yeah, what's with this town
and clowns and superstitions?

1:13:28.505 --> 1:13:33.508
Well, you ever say "bless you"
when someone sneezes?

1:13:33.510 --> 1:13:35.576
Yes, I do.

1:13:35.578 --> 1:13:38.079
-Why?
-Um...

1:13:39.816 --> 1:13:43.418
(laughs)
Actually, I don't know.

1:13:43.420 --> 1:13:47.188
Well, it originated from
an ancient superstition.

1:13:47.190 --> 1:13:50.425
People thought that evil spirits
would use a sneeze

1:13:50.427 --> 1:13:52.960
as an opportunity
to enter a person's body.

1:13:54.697 --> 1:13:56.864
"Bless you" to stop it.

1:13:58.468 --> 1:14:00.935
Okay, so you're telling me
that the clowns

1:14:00.937 --> 1:14:04.071
are part of
a superstition?

1:14:04.073 --> 1:14:07.442
Yeah.
Really more of a religion here.

1:14:07.444 --> 1:14:10.845
It's a way for us to honor
the men that came to
this town before us.

1:14:10.847 --> 1:14:14.081
They, uh, saved this town
and our grandmothers.

1:14:15.552 --> 1:14:18.019
They had the bravery
to take what they want

1:14:18.021 --> 1:14:21.489
and save the woman
from herself.

1:14:21.491 --> 1:14:22.957
(both chuckle)

1:14:22.959 --> 1:14:25.927
So, um, Jeb...

1:14:25.929 --> 1:14:28.863
are you telling me
that these clown shoes

1:14:28.865 --> 1:14:32.200
that you're wearing
are a part of a religion?

1:14:36.139 --> 1:14:39.073
I have one more
question for you.

1:14:39.075 --> 1:14:41.843
Do the shoes match
the merchandise?

1:14:45.849 --> 1:14:48.649
Only one way to find out.

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:51.219
Ah! (giggles)

1:14:51.221 --> 1:14:54.188
Is it weird that I'm craving
a cigarette right now?

1:14:54.190 --> 1:14:56.524
Well, when in Rome...

1:14:56.526 --> 1:14:58.226
Uh, yeah,
it is actually weird

1:14:58.228 --> 1:15:00.261
because nothing
about this is funny.

1:15:00.263 --> 1:15:02.930
It's actually scary,
so I don't know how you want
a cigarette right now.

1:15:02.932 --> 1:15:05.533
I still
can't get service.

1:15:05.535 --> 1:15:09.637
Can you just-- this one time--
just this one fucking time--

1:15:09.639 --> 1:15:12.006
Could you two
just put a lid on it?

1:15:12.008 --> 1:15:14.575
-(car approaching)
-Wait, wait, wait.

1:15:20.617 --> 1:15:23.184
Oh, my God. Come here, guys.
Do you see this?

1:15:23.186 --> 1:15:26.020
Like a really weird car.

1:15:26.022 --> 1:15:29.757
Like, it would be cute
if it didn't look like it
actually belonged to a circus.

1:15:29.759 --> 1:15:31.859
Yeah, it would be cute
if you were ten

1:15:31.861 --> 1:15:35.129
and it was your birthday with
a surprise clown theme.

1:15:35.131 --> 1:15:39.166
Wait a second.
Whose blood is all over the bat?

1:15:49.812 --> 1:15:53.548
How about the fact
that they actually look
like clowns right now?

1:15:53.550 --> 1:15:55.616
I'm really starting
to hate clowns.

1:16:07.597 --> 1:16:09.697
Nobody likes clowns.

1:16:16.039 --> 1:16:17.805
Okay, we gotta go.
Let's go.

1:16:17.807 --> 1:16:19.173
-Come on you guys.
-Shit.

1:16:19.175 --> 1:16:21.576
(Carlee moaning)

1:16:22.645 --> 1:16:24.712
Oh, Jeb.

1:16:46.169 --> 1:16:50.037
You know, Kitty Kat,
we forbid you to be
with any boy.

1:16:50.039 --> 1:16:52.907
You're the only girl
we have left.

1:16:52.909 --> 1:16:56.744
But, Mama, I loved him.

1:16:56.746 --> 1:16:59.013
He wasn't evil.

1:16:59.015 --> 1:17:01.782
All men are evil.

1:17:01.784 --> 1:17:04.285
And they can't be trusted.

1:17:04.287 --> 1:17:07.755
That's why we have clowns,
to protect us.

1:17:07.757 --> 1:17:10.091
Mama...

1:17:10.093 --> 1:17:13.294
he cracked his head
like an egg.

1:17:13.296 --> 1:17:15.896
-(laughs)
-It ain't right.

1:17:15.898 --> 1:17:19.767
Just because he was
an outsider.

1:17:19.769 --> 1:17:21.869
He was lovable.

1:17:21.871 --> 1:17:23.838
Daddy ain't lovable.

1:17:23.840 --> 1:17:25.272
(grunts)

1:17:25.274 --> 1:17:27.675
Heed your tongue,
young lady!

1:17:27.677 --> 1:17:31.412
Those girls are
putting worldly thoughts

1:17:31.414 --> 1:17:34.081
into that pretty
little head of yours.

1:17:34.083 --> 1:17:36.751
No, Mama.
Please don't hurt them.

1:17:36.753 --> 1:17:38.319
I'll be good.
I promise.

1:17:38.321 --> 1:17:40.755
I won't do
anything bad anymore.

1:17:42.659 --> 1:17:44.191
(panting)

1:17:45.728 --> 1:17:47.795
Is that-- is that--

1:17:50.033 --> 1:17:53.167
Kat, sweetie.

1:17:53.169 --> 1:17:55.803
Now you want to take
your turn?

1:17:57.073 --> 1:18:00.775
Oh, maybe not this time,
baby, but you will.

1:18:00.777 --> 1:18:04.311
And when you do,
you'll be one of us.

1:18:07.383 --> 1:18:10.317
It's okay, Kitty Kat.
She ain't one of us.

1:18:10.319 --> 1:18:12.953
Now you go to bed.
Go on. Git.

1:18:14.257 --> 1:18:16.824
And clean this shit up!

1:18:16.826 --> 1:18:18.325
It's a perfectly good
piece of ass.

1:18:18.327 --> 1:18:22.063
-It's your job.
-Yeah, I'll clean it up,
all right.

1:18:24.734 --> 1:18:26.434
Myrtle, baby, no.

1:18:26.436 --> 1:18:29.303
-Cigarettes,
they're bad for your health.
-(groans, laughs)

1:18:31.441 --> 1:18:35.042
My little cupcake.
You still care about me?

1:18:40.416 --> 1:18:45.953
(groaning)
Wa-- wa-- water.

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:48.322
Water.

1:18:48.324 --> 1:18:50.925
Can I get some water, please?

1:18:56.966 --> 1:19:00.501
See, baby, a good clown
is hard to find,

1:19:00.503 --> 1:19:03.437
but they're trainable.

1:19:06.309 --> 1:19:08.776
You'll find
yours someday.

1:19:28.965 --> 1:19:31.999
-On three,
you guys, you ready?
-I couldn't see anything.

1:19:32.001 --> 1:19:35.536
Guys, I'm sorry, but this
whole Scooby-Doo-mystery-gang
thing is over.

1:19:35.538 --> 1:19:38.205
We need to be hiding
or getting out of here.

1:19:38.207 --> 1:19:40.374
We need to get Carlee.

1:19:40.376 --> 1:19:43.144
Are you even
listening to me?

1:19:43.146 --> 1:19:46.847
Okay, on the count of three,
we're gonna--

1:19:46.849 --> 1:19:48.849
run to that
motel office thing, okay?

1:19:48.851 --> 1:19:50.851
We're gonna stall
'em there, all right?

1:19:51.954 --> 1:19:54.121
-One, two...
-Shit.

1:20:00.830 --> 1:20:03.464
All right, hurry.
Go, go, go.

1:20:05.034 --> 1:20:07.802
-What do we do?
-The door doesn't lock.

1:20:07.804 --> 1:20:09.436
Move. I got it.

1:20:17.113 --> 1:20:19.280
Holy shit.
That was amazing.

1:20:20.550 --> 1:20:22.449
-Good job.
-Good job.

1:20:22.451 --> 1:20:24.451
-Good job.
-Total hero status.

1:20:24.453 --> 1:20:27.254
-Let's get out of here.
-Take that, you fucking
clown fuck!

1:20:28.291 --> 1:20:31.158
-Yes! Yes!
-We did it.

1:20:31.160 --> 1:20:33.127
-Let's go get Carlee, okay?
-Oh, yeah.

1:20:33.129 --> 1:20:35.329
-Yeah.
-(screaming)

1:20:36.866 --> 1:20:38.199
Oh, my God!
Let go!

1:20:41.504 --> 1:20:44.371
Let her go!
Let her go!

1:20:44.373 --> 1:20:47.107
No! Let her go!

1:20:47.109 --> 1:20:49.076
-No! Stop!
-Bitch!

1:20:49.078 --> 1:20:51.245
Are you okay?

1:20:51.247 --> 1:20:53.280
Guys, we've gotta go!
We've gotta go!

1:20:57.954 --> 1:21:00.154
(owl hooting)

1:21:01.591 --> 1:21:04.458
How much do I owe you
for the wheel?

1:21:04.460 --> 1:21:06.861
Let's just say
we call it even.

1:21:06.863 --> 1:21:08.863
Hardly fair.

1:21:08.865 --> 1:21:11.031
But thank you.

1:21:12.401 --> 1:21:14.401
You're adorable.

1:21:21.310 --> 1:21:24.178
Thanks for the ride,

1:21:24.180 --> 1:21:26.013
and the souvenir.

1:21:26.015 --> 1:21:27.948
(engine starts)

1:21:33.222 --> 1:21:35.155
(grunts)

1:21:35.157 --> 1:21:37.424
-Ah, shit!
-No.

1:21:37.426 --> 1:21:39.994
(groans)
Fuck!

1:21:39.996 --> 1:21:42.062
Shh. I don't see them.

1:21:42.064 --> 1:21:44.298
-Okay. (groaning)
-(bone cracking)

1:21:44.300 --> 1:21:46.967
-Yeah, I think we lost them.
-I think I broke my leg!

1:21:46.969 --> 1:21:49.036
-What the--
-I think I broke my leg!

1:21:49.038 --> 1:21:50.671
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1:21:50.673 --> 1:21:52.473
Are you okay?
What the fuck? Here.

1:21:53.976 --> 1:21:56.377
-Oh, God.
-Nicole, go, please--

1:21:56.379 --> 1:21:58.445
-Just go--
Go get some help, please, now.
-What the fuck?

1:21:58.447 --> 1:22:00.381
-Go get help. I'm gonna be fine.
-I don't wanna leave you.

1:22:00.383 --> 1:22:02.149
-I'm not gonna
leave you with this.
-I will be fine.

1:22:02.151 --> 1:22:03.250
-Go get help now.
-I'm not gonna fucking
leave you like this.

1:22:03.252 --> 1:22:05.152
-Oh, God.
-I got it.

1:22:16.198 --> 1:22:19.533
-Go get the rest
of the outsiders.
-Yeah.

1:22:27.143 --> 1:22:29.376
Kat?

1:22:29.378 --> 1:22:32.046
Man:
It's judgement time!

1:22:32.048 --> 1:22:35.215
Hear-ye! Hear-ye!

1:22:35.217 --> 1:22:40.587
The Great One will decide
if she is guilty or innocent.

1:22:40.589 --> 1:22:43.691
Bring one, bring all!

1:22:43.693 --> 1:22:48.062
It'll be a night
of entertainment
for the whole family!

1:22:48.064 --> 1:22:51.598
(laughs)
Never a dull moment!

1:22:51.600 --> 1:22:53.534
Ha ha!

1:22:59.241 --> 1:23:01.575
Cigars! Cigarettes!

1:23:01.577 --> 1:23:03.644
Cigars!
Cigarettes!

1:23:03.646 --> 1:23:06.246
(chatter)

1:23:08.617 --> 1:23:11.251
(circus music playing)

1:23:34.510 --> 1:23:36.677
Cigars! Cigarettes!

1:23:36.679 --> 1:23:39.013
(laughter)

1:23:39.015 --> 1:23:41.248
Cigars! Cigarettes!

1:23:44.286 --> 1:23:47.254
(shouts)

1:23:47.256 --> 1:23:49.423
Yeah!

1:23:49.425 --> 1:23:52.226
(groans)

1:23:52.228 --> 1:23:55.662
Order!
Order in this court!

1:23:55.664 --> 1:23:57.731
(laughs)

1:23:57.733 --> 1:24:01.635
So let's get
this party started!

1:24:01.637 --> 1:24:04.204
(cheering)

1:24:11.047 --> 1:24:13.447
Burn, baby!

1:24:29.832 --> 1:24:34.101
Tonight,
we come in judgment

1:24:34.103 --> 1:24:36.303
of this outsider.

1:24:36.305 --> 1:24:38.572
This outsider!

1:24:38.574 --> 1:24:42.076
-(laughs) Burn, baby, burn!
-(jeering)

1:24:44.113 --> 1:24:48.282
-(whimpering)
-If-- if she's
found guilty,

1:24:48.284 --> 1:24:50.684
-she drops....
-(crowd cheering)

1:24:50.686 --> 1:24:54.755
...in this vat of acid.

1:24:54.757 --> 1:24:56.590
(laughs)

1:24:56.592 --> 1:24:59.093
(cheering)

1:25:02.098 --> 1:25:03.597
But...

1:25:05.501 --> 1:25:07.801
if she's found innocent,

1:25:07.803 --> 1:25:10.270
-she's set free.
-(booing)

1:25:16.112 --> 1:25:19.279
Come one and come all,

1:25:19.281 --> 1:25:24.551
and let the Great One make
the judge of the decision.

1:25:24.553 --> 1:25:27.454
-(laughing)
-(cheering)

1:25:27.456 --> 1:25:30.491
Now, Kat...

1:25:30.493 --> 1:25:34.862
I would like you to get
these proceedings started.

1:25:34.864 --> 1:25:36.630
Kat! Kat!

1:25:36.632 --> 1:25:39.766
(chanting "Kat")

1:25:43.305 --> 1:25:48.375
I don't wanna be
the first one.

1:25:48.377 --> 1:25:50.544
-(chanting stops)
-That's the beauty
about it, Kitty Kat.

1:25:50.546 --> 1:25:53.547
You ain't need to be
making no decisions.

1:25:53.549 --> 1:25:55.349
That's up the Great One
before us.

1:25:55.351 --> 1:25:57.484
(cheers)

1:25:57.486 --> 1:26:02.556
Only he can decide whether
she's innocent and spare her.

1:26:02.558 --> 1:26:05.759
-You're right, Mom.
-Little: Kat, let's see it.

1:26:05.761 --> 1:26:07.794
Make your daddy proud, Kat.

1:26:07.796 --> 1:26:10.364
(crowd chanting "Kat")

1:26:15.237 --> 1:26:17.671
Silence!

1:26:17.673 --> 1:26:20.274
Ah, yes.

1:26:20.276 --> 1:26:22.476
Now, make Daddy
proud, Kat.

1:26:23.646 --> 1:26:25.512
Keep your eye
on the prize.

1:26:25.514 --> 1:26:27.714
-(Amber whimpering)
-Silence her!

1:26:34.323 --> 1:26:36.323
(crowd jeering)

1:26:42.498 --> 1:26:44.965
-Kat!
-Yes, Daddy?

1:26:44.967 --> 1:26:47.601
That better not
have been on purpose.

1:26:47.603 --> 1:26:52.773
-Mm-mm.
-The Great One will be
very upset with you.

1:26:52.775 --> 1:26:55.475
No, Daddy,
I-I really tried.

1:26:55.477 --> 1:26:57.311
(groans)

1:26:59.682 --> 1:27:04.418
Okay, jury, let's line up
for the judgment.

1:27:04.420 --> 1:27:07.721
And in the meantime...

1:27:08.924 --> 1:27:11.858
for your entertainment,

1:27:11.860 --> 1:27:14.695
yes... (laughing)

1:27:19.568 --> 1:27:23.237
(circus music playing)

1:27:36.318 --> 1:27:38.318
I'll deal with you later.

1:27:51.033 --> 1:27:53.867
(jeering)

1:27:55.971 --> 1:27:58.038
-(laughing)
-Yeah!

1:27:59.008 --> 1:28:00.874
You can do it!

1:28:00.876 --> 1:28:02.776
Come on!

1:28:02.778 --> 1:28:04.511
(jeering)

1:28:11.287 --> 1:28:14.021
(jeering)

1:28:16.625 --> 1:28:19.393
Little:
Yes, get a pitch.

1:28:19.395 --> 1:28:21.528
Come on, Ace.

1:28:22.665 --> 1:28:24.931
(jeering)

1:28:29.805 --> 1:28:33.473
-She might be innocent.
-(jeering)

1:28:33.475 --> 1:28:36.076
Crowd: No!

1:28:36.078 --> 1:28:40.047
I hear your anger.
I feel your anger.

1:28:42.384 --> 1:28:47.554
The outsiders, they come to
our town and they laugh at us.

1:28:47.556 --> 1:28:51.925
They come to our town
and they pretend they
have an accident,

1:28:51.927 --> 1:28:54.528
and they take what's ours.

1:28:54.530 --> 1:28:57.097
And they take
our loved ones.

1:28:59.001 --> 1:29:01.835
We just want to be
left alone, right?

1:29:01.837 --> 1:29:03.837
-We want to be left alone!
-(cheering)

1:29:03.839 --> 1:29:06.740
We want to keep
what is ours!

1:29:06.742 --> 1:29:09.643
We want to keep
our loved ones!

1:29:11.013 --> 1:29:15.615
I want no part of
the outsider's world!

1:29:15.617 --> 1:29:18.385
-No part!
-That's right!

1:29:18.387 --> 1:29:22.756
And I ask you!
I ask you...

1:29:22.758 --> 1:29:28.462
why do you outsiders impose
yourself on our world?

1:29:29.565 --> 1:29:31.598
Why?! Why?!

1:29:31.600 --> 1:29:33.967
Why?! Why?!

1:29:33.969 --> 1:29:36.370
-Burn her!
-(booing)

1:29:36.372 --> 1:29:38.772
Silence!

1:29:41.777 --> 1:29:45.746
I am very,
very pleased

1:29:45.748 --> 1:29:49.983
to be the one to cast
the final stone

1:29:49.985 --> 1:29:54.521
that will decide
the outsider's fate.

1:29:54.523 --> 1:29:57.524
-Yes! Yes!
-Yes!

1:29:57.526 --> 1:29:59.960
I make no decisions.

1:29:59.962 --> 1:30:02.562
It is fate's mighty hand

1:30:02.564 --> 1:30:04.598
that shall work through me

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:08.168
to decide
the outsider's fate.

1:30:08.170 --> 1:30:10.470
-Do you agree?
-(cheering)

1:30:14.510 --> 1:30:16.410
(crowd chanting "Judge")

1:30:22.751 --> 1:30:25.619
(growls)

1:30:25.621 --> 1:30:28.655
-(cheering)
-(chanting "Judge her")

1:30:39.968 --> 1:30:42.169
-(shouts)
-(cheering)

1:30:44.940 --> 1:30:47.908
One... two...

1:30:47.910 --> 1:30:50.644
-Baby, it's on you.
-Three!

1:30:52.915 --> 1:30:55.182
(cheering)

1:30:59.488 --> 1:31:00.987
(screaming)

1:31:13.202 --> 1:31:15.502
Burn!

1:31:24.213 --> 1:31:26.246
Burn!

1:31:26.248 --> 1:31:28.248
Burn, baby, burn!

1:31:38.961 --> 1:31:41.061
(whispers)
Nicole.

1:31:41.063 --> 1:31:43.230
Nicole, are you there?

1:31:51.940 --> 1:31:54.741
Mia, Nicole,
you guys here?

1:32:03.519 --> 1:32:05.051
(gasps)

1:32:05.053 --> 1:32:07.721
Holy shit.

1:32:07.723 --> 1:32:10.290
What do I do?
Okay.

1:32:10.292 --> 1:32:12.759
(muffled) No--

1:32:12.761 --> 1:32:14.194
Sorry.

1:32:14.196 --> 1:32:16.630
-Put it back!
Put it back!
-What?

1:32:16.632 --> 1:32:19.065
If they come back and find me
untied, it'll be worse for me.

1:32:19.067 --> 1:32:20.600
It'll be worse for you.

1:32:20.602 --> 1:32:22.168
-What are you talking about?
-No, stop! Stop!

1:32:22.170 --> 1:32:24.804
-I've gotta get you out of here.
-No, I tried already!

1:32:24.806 --> 1:32:26.306
No! Stop!

1:32:26.308 --> 1:32:28.909
-This is my home.
I'm one of them.
-What?

1:32:28.911 --> 1:32:31.845
Stop. You're an outsider.
I'm inside.

1:32:31.847 --> 1:32:33.613
(screams) Stop it!

1:32:33.615 --> 1:32:36.182
-I'm one of them!
I'm one of them!
-Shh!

1:32:36.184 --> 1:32:38.885
Okay, okay,
I like being tied up, too.

1:32:38.887 --> 1:32:41.321
Okay? (shushes)
Just relax.

1:32:41.323 --> 1:32:43.924
Okay.

1:32:45.561 --> 1:32:48.094
-Don't try to save him either.
-Who?

1:32:48.096 --> 1:32:49.963
Thomas.

1:32:49.965 --> 1:32:51.932
The guy looking
for his fiancée.

1:32:51.934 --> 1:32:53.700
Where?

1:32:53.702 --> 1:32:56.603
He never shuts up.
He's over there blubbering.

1:32:56.605 --> 1:32:58.772
-What?
-"Carlee. Carlee..."

1:32:58.774 --> 1:33:00.206
-What?
-"Come back."

1:33:00.208 --> 1:33:02.576
Thomas!

1:33:03.979 --> 1:33:05.345
(shouts)

1:33:05.347 --> 1:33:07.747
(gasps)

1:33:07.749 --> 1:33:10.083
-Carlee.
-Tommy.

1:33:12.354 --> 1:33:14.721
I am so sorry, baby.

1:33:14.723 --> 1:33:16.890
-Look what they did to you.
-I'm so sorry.

1:33:16.892 --> 1:33:19.092
I'm sorry.
I love you.

1:33:19.094 --> 1:33:21.695
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:33:23.365 --> 1:33:26.099
I'm so sorry.

1:33:26.101 --> 1:33:29.002
-I love you.
-I love you.

1:33:29.004 --> 1:33:31.371
I want to marry you.

1:33:31.373 --> 1:33:34.674
We gotta get you
out of here first.

1:33:34.676 --> 1:33:37.143
-Where's the key?
-I don't know.

1:33:37.145 --> 1:33:38.912
The key...

1:33:38.914 --> 1:33:40.847
I'm gonna go upstairs

1:33:40.849 --> 1:33:43.016
and I'm gonna look
for the keys, baby.

1:33:43.018 --> 1:33:45.352
Please be careful.

1:33:45.354 --> 1:33:47.787
I don't want to
lose you again.

1:33:47.789 --> 1:33:49.956
I don't want you leaving,
Carlee, please.

1:33:49.958 --> 1:33:52.892
I'll be back.
I promise, okay?

1:33:52.894 --> 1:33:55.061
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.033
I'll be right back.
I promise.

1:34:04.940 --> 1:34:06.740
(muffled)
Thank you.

1:34:13.882 --> 1:34:16.650
If I was a key,
where would I be?

1:34:20.789 --> 1:34:22.656
Man:
Look inside.

1:34:27.229 --> 1:34:29.796
(whispers)
This isn't happening.

1:35:14.810 --> 1:35:16.976
-(groans)
-(door closes)

1:35:31.460 --> 1:35:33.860
-Mia: Carlee!
-(vehicle approaching)

1:35:33.862 --> 1:35:35.195
Mia?

1:35:39.401 --> 1:35:42.102
-(vehicle stops)
-Can you believe this shit?

1:35:42.104 --> 1:35:44.104
Fuck!

1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:46.973
My God, get down!

1:35:49.511 --> 1:35:51.111
Shit.

1:36:19.374 --> 1:36:22.108
Hey, freak show!

1:36:22.110 --> 1:36:24.377
You looking for me?
Come on!

1:36:31.987 --> 1:36:33.520
(grunts)

1:36:36.124 --> 1:36:38.825
-What the fuck are these clowns?
-(laughing)

1:36:45.033 --> 1:36:47.200
(seething)

1:37:11.326 --> 1:37:13.426
There you are.

1:37:22.170 --> 1:37:24.904
-(engine stalling)
-Fucking car!

1:37:24.906 --> 1:37:27.407
(groaning)

1:37:27.409 --> 1:37:30.143
(laughing)

1:37:30.145 --> 1:37:33.079
Where do you think
you're going?

1:37:33.081 --> 1:37:36.282
My name is Chuckles
and I love jokes.

1:37:36.284 --> 1:37:39.385
I got so many
funny ones for you.

1:37:39.387 --> 1:37:42.121
I've got a joke for you.

1:37:42.123 --> 1:37:44.924
-(screams)
-I'll stab you in the neck!

1:37:46.094 --> 1:37:48.094
(gurgling)

1:37:50.866 --> 1:37:52.565
(body thuds)

1:37:52.567 --> 1:37:55.235
That made him very sad.

1:37:55.237 --> 1:37:58.304
-(engine stalling)
-Come on, you fucker!

1:37:58.306 --> 1:38:01.040
(groans)
Fuck!

1:38:05.547 --> 1:38:07.413
-(car door closes)
-(whimpering)

1:38:14.289 --> 1:38:16.356
Jeb, are you there?

1:38:16.358 --> 1:38:18.658
Jeb!

1:38:18.660 --> 1:38:20.293
Shit.

1:38:20.295 --> 1:38:22.662
Hey, come back for more?

1:38:22.664 --> 1:38:26.499
No. I'm sorry about that.
I really am.

1:38:26.501 --> 1:38:29.535
I'm still engaged to get
married and I have a fiancé.

1:38:29.537 --> 1:38:32.105
And he's hurt really bad
and I need your help.

1:38:32.107 --> 1:38:34.140
You're the only one
I can trust.

1:38:35.477 --> 1:38:37.243
Yeah, well...

1:38:38.446 --> 1:38:40.313
I'm all yours.

1:38:40.315 --> 1:38:42.949
Oh, shit.

1:38:42.951 --> 1:38:45.618
Oh, God.
This easy for me.

1:38:45.620 --> 1:38:47.654
Perfect.
Thank you.

1:38:49.024 --> 1:38:50.490
Whoo!

1:38:51.660 --> 1:38:53.960
(cheering)

1:39:14.482 --> 1:39:16.649
(screaming)

1:39:16.651 --> 1:39:19.185
-Oh, my God!
-(cheering, laughing)

1:39:20.121 --> 1:39:22.121
Oh, my fucking God!

1:39:22.123 --> 1:39:24.057
Somebody please help me!

1:39:32.734 --> 1:39:35.535
Please stop doing this to me!
Please!

1:39:35.537 --> 1:39:37.537
I beg of you! Please!

1:39:39.040 --> 1:39:42.408
Crowd:
Do it. Do it. Do it.

1:39:42.410 --> 1:39:44.344
Kat.

1:39:44.346 --> 1:39:47.046
I know it's been
a difficult day for you, Kat.

1:39:47.048 --> 1:39:49.682
Don't disappoint us
by missing again.

1:39:49.684 --> 1:39:52.618
Daddy, I don't think
I want a turn.

1:39:52.620 --> 1:39:56.255
Kat, it's time for you
to join the family.

1:39:56.257 --> 1:40:00.526
Daddy, I even let her
borrow my cowboy boots.

1:40:00.528 --> 1:40:02.528
She was my friend.

1:40:02.530 --> 1:40:05.131
Lookie here.

1:40:05.133 --> 1:40:06.666
(gasps)

1:40:08.336 --> 1:40:12.305
Do it, Kat.
Join the family, Kat.

1:40:12.307 --> 1:40:13.673
-Do it.
-Do it.

1:40:13.675 --> 1:40:15.208
Oh, my God, please.

1:40:15.210 --> 1:40:17.543
(crying)

1:40:17.545 --> 1:40:19.746
-Come on, Kitty Kat.
-Come on, baby.

1:40:19.748 --> 1:40:22.181
Make your daddy proud.
Come on, baby.

1:40:22.183 --> 1:40:24.183
-(cheering)
-Do it, Kat.

1:40:26.087 --> 1:40:28.221
(cheering)

1:40:30.692 --> 1:40:32.558
Ah, my little girl.

1:40:34.095 --> 1:40:37.063
Her first steps
to becoming one of us.

1:40:37.065 --> 1:40:39.632
I'm so proud.

1:40:39.634 --> 1:40:42.268
Oh! (kisses)

1:40:43.271 --> 1:40:45.171
I love you,
little girl.

1:40:45.173 --> 1:40:47.140
Daddy's best.

1:40:54.783 --> 1:40:57.483
Sorry, babe.

1:40:57.485 --> 1:40:59.552
You know how us girls are.

1:40:59.554 --> 1:41:02.321
Can't resist
a new pair of shoes.

1:41:07.095 --> 1:41:09.695
I can't!
(labored breathing)

1:41:09.697 --> 1:41:11.330
I can't!

1:41:13.468 --> 1:41:17.203
I can't! I need more--
I need more time.

1:41:17.205 --> 1:41:20.440
You're doing good, baby.
Just bring little Jeb
into this world, okay?

1:41:20.442 --> 1:41:23.309
I know he's gonna be
just like his daddy.

1:41:23.311 --> 1:41:25.144
(panting, crying)

1:41:28.316 --> 1:41:31.250
-Jeb: Doing good.
-(knuckles crack)

1:41:32.353 --> 1:41:34.253
Calm down.

1:41:37.792 --> 1:41:39.792
We need another push.

1:41:41.362 --> 1:41:43.863
We need one more push.

1:41:43.865 --> 1:41:46.532
-One more big push, Carlee.
-Breathe, breathe.

1:41:46.534 --> 1:41:48.568
(chuckles)

1:41:48.570 --> 1:41:52.138
-(baby crying)
-It looks like you have
a beautiful baby girl.

1:41:58.880 --> 1:42:01.380
You did good.
You did good.

1:42:07.689 --> 1:42:10.223
Congratulations.

1:42:10.225 --> 1:42:11.858
She looks just like her daddy.

1:42:11.860 --> 1:42:13.726
-(Carlee gasps)
-(bone cracks)

1:42:16.464 --> 1:42:18.598
Mm.

1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:21.767
Woman!
Bring me another beer.

1:42:21.769 --> 1:42:23.736
(pig grunting)

1:42:25.840 --> 1:42:27.907
Woman: Coming.

1:42:31.346 --> 1:42:33.846
What's taking so long, woman?

1:42:33.848 --> 1:42:36.449
<i> Woman:</i>
<i> A woman's place is</i>
<i> always in the kitchen.</i>

1:42:45.293 --> 1:42:47.360
(grunts)

1:42:47.362 --> 1:42:49.462
Salisbury steak,
my favorite.

1:42:49.464 --> 1:42:51.264
(chuckles)

1:42:54.669 --> 1:42:57.203
(laughing)

1:43:12.787 --> 1:43:15.254
-Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.
-Wow.

1:43:15.256 --> 1:43:17.223
Honey, look.
Oh, my God.

1:43:17.225 --> 1:43:19.525
-Can we go home?
-No.

1:43:19.527 --> 1:43:21.460
-What do you mean "go home"?
We're on vacation.
-Wow.

1:43:21.462 --> 1:43:23.362
-Look at that.
-Hey, Danny, look at this.
Look it.

1:43:23.364 --> 1:43:25.565
-Honk honk. (laughs)
-Woman: It's awesome.

1:43:25.567 --> 1:43:27.500
-I love this place.
-Aren't these funny?

1:43:27.502 --> 1:43:29.402
-Honey, this is awesome.
-I love it. Yeah.

1:43:31.372 --> 1:43:32.738
Good morning.

1:43:32.740 --> 1:43:35.208
Welcome to the world's famous
Clown Inn.

1:43:35.210 --> 1:43:36.876
Thank you.
We're so excited to be here.

1:43:36.878 --> 1:43:38.778
This place is amazing.

1:43:38.780 --> 1:43:41.747
-Yes, we buy everything
that has to do with clowns.
-Yes.

1:43:41.749 --> 1:43:45.384
Man: Good thing we got a flat
tire before we got to this town
or we would've missed it.

1:43:45.386 --> 1:43:47.887
-It's so serendipitous
that we ended up here.
-Yes.

1:43:47.889 --> 1:43:50.690
We love clowns.

1:43:50.692 --> 1:43:53.359
Oh, look.
Look at her shoes.

1:43:53.361 --> 1:43:55.928
Oh, wow. Look at the shoes.
Oh, my God. Oh, wait.

1:43:57.332 --> 1:43:59.732
Wait, wait, wait.

1:44:02.670 --> 1:44:04.403
(whispers)
Here, here, here.

1:44:06.307 --> 1:44:07.907
Ready?
Hold on one second.

1:44:07.909 --> 1:44:09.909
Okay.

1:44:09.911 --> 1:44:12.011
-We brought our own clown noses.
-Ta-da!

1:44:12.013 --> 1:44:14.013
(laughter)

1:44:15.950 --> 1:44:18.651
Come on.
This is so awesome.

1:44:18.653 --> 1:44:20.486
That's so nice.

1:44:20.488 --> 1:44:22.521
You guys are going
to love this place.

1:44:22.523 --> 1:44:25.491
-It's like you've died
and gone to clown heaven.
-Woman: Yes.

1:44:25.493 --> 1:44:27.526
-Awesome.
-I got you a nice room
with a view.

1:44:27.528 --> 1:44:29.262
Oh, Tommy bear.

1:44:32.533 --> 1:44:34.467
Hey, darling.

1:44:34.469 --> 1:44:36.669
Would you show this
lovely couple to their room?

1:44:36.671 --> 1:44:38.437
I gave them suite 13.

1:44:38.439 --> 1:44:40.573
I'd love to.

1:44:41.643 --> 1:44:43.542
Oh, you brought a child.

1:44:43.544 --> 1:44:46.012
Yeah. Chad.

1:44:46.014 --> 1:44:48.281
-He really loves clowns.
-No, I don't.

1:44:48.283 --> 1:44:50.349
(laughs)

1:44:50.351 --> 1:44:52.818
I'd love to help you
with your bags.

1:44:54.856 --> 1:44:57.456
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you so much.

1:44:57.458 --> 1:44:59.458
Everyone is so nice here.

1:44:59.460 --> 1:45:02.061
-Mom, can we go home?
-No, we're gonna have fun.

1:45:02.063 --> 1:45:06.032
My mama always said,
"Any man can be trained."

1:45:06.034 --> 1:45:07.867
Isn't that right, honey?

1:45:07.869 --> 1:45:10.069
Yes, dear.

1:45:18.446 --> 1:45:20.046
Follow me.

1:45:20.048 --> 1:45:21.781
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

1:45:21.783 --> 1:45:23.549
-Come on.
-No, I don't like it here.

1:45:23.551 --> 1:45:25.551
It's good.
It'll be fine. Shh.

1:45:25.553 --> 1:45:27.053
Just follow him.

1:45:28.589 --> 1:45:30.456
We'll have a great time.

1:45:36.030 --> 1:45:38.864
(sinister laughter)

1:45:41.469 --> 1:45:43.469
¶¶

1:45:49.444 --> 1:45:51.944
(humming)

1:46:05.526 --> 1:46:09.028
¶ I love when you
kiss on my neck ¶

1:46:09.030 --> 1:46:13.065
¶ And your fingers
caress my body ¶

1:46:13.067 --> 1:46:16.902
¶ It's so good
I'm scratching your back ¶

1:46:16.904 --> 1:46:21.374
¶ You're so strong
and I feel so slutty ¶

1:46:21.376 --> 1:46:25.010
¶ My heart
beats like a drum ¶

1:46:25.012 --> 1:46:29.048
¶ And my toes
are getting numb ¶

1:46:29.050 --> 1:46:33.586
¶ We are moving like one,
mm-mm ¶

1:46:33.588 --> 1:46:36.489
¶ Moving like one ¶

1:46:37.658 --> 1:46:39.625
¶ Faster ¶

1:46:39.627 --> 1:46:41.660
¶ Mm ¶

1:46:41.662 --> 1:46:43.729
¶ Faster ¶

1:46:45.700 --> 1:46:47.500
¶ Faster ¶

1:46:49.871 --> 1:46:53.806
¶ Oh, it feels so right ¶

1:46:53.808 --> 1:46:57.777
¶ Woman,
you're one of a kind ¶

1:46:57.779 --> 1:47:01.547
¶ Your kisses
are sweeter than honey ¶

1:47:01.549 --> 1:47:05.618
¶ I know they're not
meant for me ¶

1:47:05.620 --> 1:47:09.789
¶ But still a good case
for a study ¶

1:47:09.791 --> 1:47:13.192
¶ The stage for us is set ¶

1:47:13.194 --> 1:47:18.597
¶ And we're getting
soaking wet ¶

1:47:18.599 --> 1:47:21.467
¶ We're still not done yet ¶

1:47:21.469 --> 1:47:23.969
¶ No, not done yet ¶

1:47:26.107 --> 1:47:28.040
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:28.042 --> 1:47:30.109
¶ Mm ¶

1:47:30.111 --> 1:47:32.077
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:33.981 --> 1:47:35.881
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:38.052 --> 1:47:42.121
¶ Oh, it feels so right ¶

1:47:42.123 --> 1:47:44.023
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:44.025 --> 1:47:46.158
¶ I hear you say ¶

1:47:46.160 --> 1:47:48.027
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:48.029 --> 1:47:50.129
¶ Go all the way ¶

1:47:50.131 --> 1:47:51.797
¶ Faster ¶

1:47:51.799 --> 1:47:54.033
¶ Mm ¶

1:47:54.035 --> 1:47:58.604
¶ Oh, it feels so right ¶

1:47:58.606 --> 1:48:03.242
¶ Never had a lover
like this before ¶

1:48:05.847 --> 1:48:09.715
¶ Mm, every time
I think of you ¶

1:48:09.717 --> 1:48:12.017
¶ I want more ¶

1:48:14.021 --> 1:48:19.625
¶ Oh, never had a love
like this before ¶

1:48:22.129 --> 1:48:25.598
¶ Oh, every time
I think of you ¶

1:48:25.600 --> 1:48:28.267
¶ I want more ¶

1:48:30.004 --> 1:48:32.104
-¶ I want more ¶
-¶ Yes ¶

1:48:32.106 --> 1:48:34.006
-¶ I need more ¶
-¶ Mm-hmm ¶

1:48:34.008 --> 1:48:36.108
-¶ Give me more ¶
-¶ Like this? ¶

1:48:36.110 --> 1:48:38.611
¶ I need more ¶

1:48:38.613 --> 1:48:42.014
¶ Every time
I think of you ¶

1:48:42.016 --> 1:48:44.517
¶ I want more ¶

1:48:45.853 --> 1:48:48.153
-¶ Oh, I want more ¶
-¶ Oh ¶

1:48:48.155 --> 1:48:50.089
¶ I need more ¶

1:48:50.091 --> 1:48:52.124
¶ Give me more ¶

1:48:52.126 --> 1:48:54.560
¶ I need more ¶

1:48:54.562 --> 1:48:57.796
¶ Every time
I think of you ¶

1:48:57.798 --> 1:49:00.132
¶ I want more ¶

1:49:02.904 --> 1:49:05.571
