00:05.005 --> 00:07.882
["Toccata and Fugue in D Minor" playing]

00:09.843 --> 00:15.682
Halloween. Fright Night.
Spook-tober 30-cursed!

00:15.765 --> 00:18.643
Oh, there's the light switch.
I'm still getting used to this new house.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.771
I just bought it and it's the '60s!
No, I'm just kidding!

00:21.855 --> 00:23.857
It's 1993, and I'm wearing a costume!

00:23.940 --> 00:27.193
Groovy threads!
But you just got drafted, hippie!

00:27.277 --> 00:29.946
-Hmm?
-Into the cutest husband army!

00:30.030 --> 00:32.073
-[laughs, moans]
-Aw!

00:32.532 --> 00:33.366
Where's your costume?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.493
Can't I just wear a dumb hat
and say I'm Blossom?

00:35.577 --> 00:37.495
In my opinionation... Yes.

00:37.579 --> 00:40.707
I am so excited to go
to a real Hollywood party

00:40.790 --> 00:43.084
with my husband the TV star.

00:43.168 --> 00:45.462
Just do me a favor
and don't leave me alone, okay?

00:45.545 --> 00:48.298
-Okay!
-Now hurry up and finish getting ready.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.591
I'm kidding.

00:49.674 --> 00:51.384
Can you imagine
if I spoke to you like that?

00:51.468 --> 00:52.844
I really can't!

00:52.927 --> 00:55.263
Next time, we're doing
a couples costume, though!

00:55.346 --> 00:59.392
It's the perfect way to tell the world
that you are completely on the same...

00:59.768 --> 01:01.519
- paaaaage?
-What are you wearing?

01:01.603 --> 01:04.189
I thought we were going
as Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling

01:04.272 --> 01:06.483
in the this-year 2004 hit film
The Notebook.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.069
Ooοοοh!  You just said,  "The Notebook."

01:09.152 --> 01:11.279
I thought you were gonna be, like,
a pen or something.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.740
The important thing is
we both look super-cute,

01:13.823 --> 01:15.241
and everyone is gonna be, like,

01:15.325 --> 01:18.411
"Hey, is that Jessica Biel
from the upcoming  Blade: Trinity?''

01:18.495 --> 01:22.749
And I'll say my famous  Blade: Trinity
catchphrase, "Stop goofin' around, Blade!"

01:22.832 --> 01:24.959
Are you sure you're gonna be okay
at this party?

01:25.043 --> 01:27.545
Whenever I went with Katrina,
we'd always end up in a big fight.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.798
Well, I'm not Katrina.
This is gonna be fun.

01:29.881 --> 01:32.008
Okay. I just know you're afraid
of mummies.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.636
And since it's Halloween,
we might see some mummies.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.970
I'm not afraid of mummies.

01:36.054 --> 01:39.724
I just don't like them
because of an incident...

01:40.058 --> 01:41.101
from my past.

01:41.309 --> 01:43.978
Will you stay on the lookout
and keep those creepy corpses away?

01:44.062 --> 01:47.690
I'll be sure to make
a mental  note  of it!

01:47.774 --> 01:48.817
I'm a notebook.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.735
I'm not sure I get our costumes.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.153
You're the guy from  The Hangover.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.240
The first one, which just came out
this year. Why did I say "first one?"

01:55.323 --> 01:58.618
There's only one  Hangover  movie,
and it's 2009.

01:58.827 --> 02:02.997
-And you are...?
-Your Baby Bjorn Borg.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.290
Famous '70s tennis player!

02:04.374 --> 02:07.210
-And what's with the robot stuff?
-Borg. From  Star Trek?

02:07.293 --> 02:08.461
And you're also a baby?

02:08.545 --> 02:12.298
In  The Hangover,  the guy had a Baby Bjorn.
Baby Bjorn Borg.

02:12.924 --> 02:15.009
-Seems like a lot of explaining.
-People will get it.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.887
Anyway, we are going to have fun
at this party!

02:18.012 --> 02:20.306
You said BoJack Horseman
is gonna be there?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.267
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.311
I'm not! Every Halloween party I went to
with one of my ex-wives,

02:25.395 --> 02:27.021
we'd get in a huge blow out.

02:27.230 --> 02:30.400
I am so relieved that you are fun
and easygoing,

02:30.483 --> 02:33.194
-so there's no danger of that happening!
-Mm-hmm...

02:33.361 --> 02:35.905
I love that we both love parties.
But more than that...

02:36.322 --> 02:38.741
-I love you.
-Aw, I love you, too.

02:38.825 --> 02:40.660
And I love these costumes!

02:40.743 --> 02:42.912
But tell me one more time,
what are these costumes?

02:42.996 --> 02:46.082
We're new social media app
sensation Tweed Feed!

02:46.166 --> 02:47.667
It's Insta plus Snapchat...

02:47.750 --> 02:51.754
if they both boinked Friendster,
which I guess was a thing in the '70s?

02:52.547 --> 02:57.427
[chuckles] Believe you me.
This party is going to be dope. Booyah!

02:57.927 --> 02:59.804
It'll be off the heezy fo' sheezy.

03:00.346 --> 03:02.223
OMG, it's gonna be cray-cray!

03:02.765 --> 03:06.561
Turnt! This is going to be
the best Halloween ever!

03:06.728 --> 03:08.229
[theme music playing]

04:04.494 --> 04:08.373
Wow. My first fancy Hollywoo party.
"I'm ready for my close up!"

04:08.456 --> 04:09.332
Nice!

04:09.415 --> 04:11.584
-Sunset Boulevard?
-I usually take  Fountain.

04:12.752 --> 04:16.047
BoJack must really love Halloween
if he has this big bash every year, huh?

04:16.130 --> 04:18.675
Oh, yeah, he's a real fiend for the 'ween.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.468
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

04:20.551 --> 04:23.096
-Who are you and what are you doing here?
-[chuckling] Good one!

04:23.179 --> 04:25.431
Pretending not to know your old friend
Mr. Peanutbutter.

04:25.515 --> 04:26.641
Why are you at my house?

04:26.724 --> 04:29.602
Remember when I invited you
to my Halloween party, and you said,

04:29.686 --> 04:30.937
you'd love to come, but couldn't

04:31.020 --> 04:32.981
because you were having
your own Halloween party?

04:33.064 --> 04:33.898
Oh, right.

04:33.982 --> 04:37.735
Well, I'm sure my guests will show up
any minute, so, you should probably go.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.364
Well, I figured,
"Hey, why not have a crossover party?"

04:41.447 --> 04:45.285
So, I brought my party, wait for it,
to you!

04:45.368 --> 04:48.830
That was the first ever  "Wait for it!"
It's 1993!

04:48.913 --> 04:50.498
-Uh...
-Come on in, guys!

04:50.581 --> 04:51.791
-[cheering]
-[music playing]

04:51.958 --> 04:54.419
-Um...
-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

04:54.544 --> 04:56.087
God damn it, why are you here?

04:56.170 --> 05:00.133
At the end of last year's Halloween party,
you said, "Let's do this again next year,"

05:00.216 --> 05:03.344
like you've said at every Halloween party
for the last 11 years!

05:03.428 --> 05:04.595
[cheering, whooping]

05:04.762 --> 05:06.306
That does not sound like me.

05:07.432 --> 05:11.519
Oh, no. Mr. Peanutbutter?
Partygoers? No. Is it--

05:11.602 --> 05:12.478
Sure is!

05:12.562 --> 05:15.732
Happy "Your 25-Years-Running"
Halloween Party!

05:15.815 --> 05:17.483
-[cheering]
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!

05:17.567 --> 05:20.903
-Hallo-ween! Hallo-ween!
-No. Don't. Please. Don't. No. You see--

05:21.070 --> 05:23.531
So, we're having a party?
Why didn't you say this was happening?

05:23.614 --> 05:26.534
Because I hate that it happens.
I take no action to make it happen.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.829
Every year, I pray that it won't happen,
and it keeps happening anyway!

05:29.912 --> 05:32.623
I feel like an idiot being
at a Halloween party without a costume.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.418
-Who cares? I don't have a costume.
-Uh, you're wearing a costume.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.754
Do you mean, in the sense
that we all wear costumes,

05:37.837 --> 05:40.757
such as we reveal facets of ourselves
to those closest to us,

05:40.840 --> 05:42.383
but our truest selves remain hidden?

05:42.508 --> 05:45.178
No, in the sense
that you are literally wearing a costume

05:45.261 --> 05:47.055
-from the TV show we both work on.
-Oh, yeah!

05:47.138 --> 05:48.890
I'll go to Rite Aid to see
what I can arrange.

05:48.973 --> 05:50.641
Don't let the party end
before I get back.

05:50.808 --> 05:52.560
I definitely will let it die down!

05:54.062 --> 05:56.522
Oh, shit, the Halloween party.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.775
-[guests chattering]
-[music playing]

05:59.275 --> 06:01.694
Oh. Hey, careful with the-- I'm sorry.
Can you put a coaster--

06:01.778 --> 06:03.112
-[doorbell rings]
-Can someone--?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.655
-You! Marv's intern!
-[grunts]

06:04.739 --> 06:06.157
-You're on door duty.
-You got it!

06:06.240 --> 06:08.284
-[glass shatters]
-I'm very good at opening doors.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.078
Do you have any candy
for trick-or-treaters?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.205
No. I don't know.
Just hand out these Emmy screeners.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.247
I'm on it.

06:13.331 --> 06:16.167
Those kids'll be holding out their hands
for Franz.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.836
Why grip a Twix when you can Sip-o-wicz?

06:18.920 --> 06:22.090
What? I don't-- Just keep answering
the door until I tell you to stop.

06:22.173 --> 06:24.133
-You got it, chief!
-[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

06:25.468 --> 06:29.430
-Diane! What are you supposed to be?
-An annoyed writer who hates Halloween.

06:29.514 --> 06:31.224
Well, you are nailing it.

06:31.307 --> 06:34.685
I'm just here to drop off pages
for BoJack. How's the party?

06:34.769 --> 06:37.188
I wouldn't know.
I'm stuck on door duty, like always.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.815
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

06:38.940 --> 06:39.941
Trick or treat!

06:40.024 --> 06:42.318
No. You are way too old
to be trick-or-treating,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.404
and way too young to be a guest
at this party.

06:44.487 --> 06:49.242
Oh, no! Why did I give you the option
of trick or treat? I just wanted treat!

06:49.325 --> 06:52.120
Come back when you're five years older,
or three years younger.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.621
[doorbell rings, horse neighs]

06:53.996 --> 06:54.831
How 'bout now?

06:54.914 --> 06:56.290
Okay. Come on in.

06:56.874 --> 06:59.710
-Whoa! Cool house.
-Oh, thank you.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.046
-It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.
-Really?

07:02.130 --> 07:06.008
-Why does he make you answer the door?
-No, he doesn't make me, he's--

07:06.134 --> 07:10.179
Oh, my God. You're right! What am I doing?
What am I doing with my life?

07:10.263 --> 07:13.766
Uh, well, judging by your outfit,
I'd say you're a pilot of some sort?

07:13.850 --> 07:16.644
I moved to L.A. when I was 18
and now I'm 35!

07:16.727 --> 07:19.897
-Everything's happening so fast!
-Oh, no! I'm 18!

07:20.106 --> 07:23.401
Am I going to be 35 soon?
That's when they make you president!

07:23.484 --> 07:26.362
I don't want that!
That's too much responsibility!

07:26.446 --> 07:29.240
I can't do this anymore.
You! Take my shift!

07:29.323 --> 07:32.160
Oh, no!
The responsibilities are already starting!

07:32.243 --> 07:33.369
I gotta live my life!

07:33.453 --> 07:36.914
I deserve to be adored by a man,
yet here my dreams lie dormant!

07:36.998 --> 07:38.624
I don't mean to get mordantly morbid,

07:38.708 --> 07:42.336
but did I get all adorably adorned
to get bored manning doors? No more!

07:43.421 --> 07:46.424
Okay, this cider has not been
sufficiently alcoholed.

07:46.632 --> 07:49.719
If I'm trapped here with all you losers,
I'm at least getting drunk.

07:50.094 --> 07:51.220
[sips]

07:51.304 --> 07:53.681
Whoa! God! I think
somebody spiked the cider!

07:53.764 --> 07:56.225
[chuckles] Well, I guess
one drink won't hurt.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.768
No, I get that it's the  X-Files.

07:57.852 --> 08:01.063
I'm just saying, what happened to the "A"
through "W" Files?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.232
I wanna see that show. More files!

08:03.316 --> 08:04.775
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, there you are!

08:04.859 --> 08:07.653
Sweetheart, you disappeared
while I was in the bathroom.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.324
Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just
got distracted by the fun party.

08:11.407 --> 08:14.702
But I will not leave your side agai--
Oh, my God, is that Erica?

08:14.785 --> 08:16.287
No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.707
Katrina. Erica doesn't know anybody else
at this party.

08:19.790 --> 08:21.501
It would be rude to leave her
all by herself.

08:21.584 --> 08:23.085
Well, can I at least come with you?

08:23.169 --> 08:25.254
You know Erica can't talk
to two people at once

08:25.338 --> 08:27.131
on account of her split-brain procedure!

08:27.215 --> 08:30.760
Why don't you go talk to, uh...
the teacher from  Ferris Bueller's Day Off?

08:30.843 --> 08:31.677
Ben Stein?

08:31.761 --> 08:35.890
I'll bet that famously boring man
is a blast at parties. I'll be right back.

08:35.973 --> 08:38.309
-No, don't--
-Erica! Love the costume!

08:38.392 --> 08:41.687
Where did you find such a hideous--?
Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.

08:41.771 --> 08:42.813
Ugh!

08:45.191 --> 08:47.527
Are you sure this is a good idea,
13-year-old Todd?

08:47.610 --> 08:50.112
It's part of the Halloween Code.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.491
If you don't give teenagers candy,
they're going to TP your house.

08:53.574 --> 08:54.534
Okay.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.576
[grunts]

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
[grunts]

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
[grunts]

09:00.414 --> 09:03.751
Okay, I've scoped out the party,
and I've yet to see a single mummy.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.003
As Margaret Thatcher's children
often asked,

09:06.087 --> 09:07.880
[imitating child]
"Is Mummy coming to see us?"

09:07.964 --> 09:09.757
[normal]
And as their nanny always replied,

09:09.840 --> 09:11.050
[British accent] "Not tonight."

09:11.217 --> 09:12.802
-Thank god.
-[normal voice] I have to ask,

09:12.885 --> 09:14.345
what is the deal with the mummies?

09:14.428 --> 09:17.306
Okay. I auditioned for  The Mummy  movie.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.100
-The one with Brendan Fraser?
-Ooh!

09:19.183 --> 09:20.768
And I thought everything was going well,

09:20.851 --> 09:23.312
and then something
really traumatic happened.

09:23.479 --> 09:27.525
-Oh, my God, what?
-I, uh... I didn't get the part.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.028
That's it? You just didn't get it?

09:31.195 --> 09:33.698
I really wanted it!
And it still haunts me!

09:33.781 --> 09:36.576
It's my one major career disappointment
as of 2004,

09:36.659 --> 09:38.244
so could you please do me
this one thing

09:38.327 --> 09:39.996
and make sure I don't see any mummies?

09:40.079 --> 09:41.998
I promise. No mummies.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.459
Remember that time that lady
freaked out 'cause she saw a mummy?

09:45.543 --> 09:46.877
[BoJack and Pickles laughing]

09:46.961 --> 09:50.047
-Who was that lady?
-Uh, that was actually Jessica Biel.

09:50.131 --> 09:51.173
Who? [chuckles]

09:51.382 --> 09:53.175
-One of my ex-wives?
-Oh, yeah!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.761
You've brought so many wives
and girlfriends to these parties,

09:55.845 --> 09:59.307
-I cannot keep track.
-Well, don't forget about Pickles, huh?

09:59.390 --> 10:02.602
Uh, what? Why is the waitress here
talking about pickles?

10:02.685 --> 10:03.644
Somebody order pickles?

10:03.728 --> 10:06.230
No, BoJack, this is my girlfriend.
Her name is Pickles.

10:06.314 --> 10:08.065
You can remember
because if you look at me,

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
and don't recall my name, you'll think,

10:10.067 --> 10:12.111
"Who is this person?
I'm in a real pickle!"

10:12.194 --> 10:14.697
And then just know that my name
is like the thing that you're in,

10:14.780 --> 10:16.532
but with an "S" at the end.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.451
-What?
-I'm Pickles!

10:18.534 --> 10:21.329
-My last name is Aplenty!
-Do I need to know this one?

10:21.537 --> 10:23.956
-Is she gonna be around for a while?
-[chuckles]

10:24.040 --> 10:25.625
I like that you're razzing me.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.668
It really makes me feel
like one of the gang.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.129
If he teases you, that means he likes you.

10:30.212 --> 10:32.131
What? Is that what people think
when I tease them?

10:33.716 --> 10:34.800
[gasps]

10:35.134 --> 10:36.552
[sighs] Cool.

10:37.553 --> 10:39.889
Remember the year
that Pinky won the costume contest,

10:39.972 --> 10:42.725
but then it turned out he'd just lost
all his belongings in a fire,

10:42.808 --> 10:44.894
and those clothes were all that he owned?

10:44.977 --> 10:46.812
-[laughing]
-[gulps] That was classic!

10:46.896 --> 10:49.190
Oh, shit, I gotta go run
the costume contest.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.609
Ow! My back! Why'd I do that?

10:51.859 --> 10:54.487
It sounds like
you all have a lot of history.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.615
Yeah. I can't believe
we've been doing this party since '93.

10:57.698 --> 11:02.578
-That's the year I was born!
-I... did not realize that!

11:02.828 --> 11:04.288
[chuckles] Hey, cheers!

11:04.372 --> 11:05.665
-[gulps]
-[Diane sighs]

11:05.831 --> 11:07.375
Are you having fun?

11:07.458 --> 11:11.504
Yeah, I'm having a great time explaining
my costume to people over and over again.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.757
Hey, here's a thought:
if you don't get someone's costume,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.468
you don't need to tell them!
Just live your life!

11:17.677 --> 11:20.388
-Do you wanna leave?
-No, no, no, no! I'm fun!

11:20.471 --> 11:22.598
I don't want to leave! [chuckles]

11:22.890 --> 11:24.100
I wanna leave!

11:24.225 --> 11:27.728
Who has the yellow military
assault vehicle blocking me in?

11:27.812 --> 11:30.731
-Oh, that's me!
-Since when do you drive a Hummer?

11:30.815 --> 11:33.526
Company car.
I just like it 'cause it matches my hat.

11:33.609 --> 11:37.905
Plus, lots of room for the golf clubs,
and, boy, does that kitten purr.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.783
Why don't you take her out for a spin
and see how she handles?

11:41.450 --> 11:42.493
What is his costume?

11:42.660 --> 11:46.872
-Diane! Hi!
-Hey...

11:46.956 --> 11:50.084
Am I on the hit Priscilla Barnes vehicle
Three's Company  right now,

11:50.167 --> 11:51.502
because three's company.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.921
-I'm just trying to get out of here.
-Oh, my gosh, Diane,

11:54.088 --> 11:57.675
I just want you to know that I know
that you and Mister have a history...

11:57.758 --> 11:59.260
-"Mister?"
-And I'm fine with it,

11:59.343 --> 12:03.305
and there's no reason we should be awkward
around each other, or jealous, you know?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.182
-I'm not jealous of you.
-Okay, good.

12:05.266 --> 12:09.603
I'm not jealous of you either,
even though you are really intimidating.

12:09.687 --> 12:13.023
But if we were jealous of each other,
that would be very normal,

12:13.107 --> 12:16.777
so either way, it's totally cool.
Totally cool. [hiccups]

12:17.361 --> 12:18.821
Should we do shots together

12:18.904 --> 12:21.115
to, like, celebrate
how normal we're being?

12:21.657 --> 12:23.951
Yeah, this is a good situation.

12:24.034 --> 12:25.619
Okay, bye, Diane!

12:25.703 --> 12:29.790
-Did I screw up? I'm so stupid.
-No. That's just Diane.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.042
She doesn't like parties
and she hates fun.

12:32.293 --> 12:35.171
-Oh!
-No, that's not fair. She used to be fun.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.090
In fact, when we first started dating,
my favorite thing about her was

12:38.174 --> 12:40.468
that she was so much more fun
than my other ex-wives.

12:40.551 --> 12:43.137
Oh, we're talking about your exes again!
That's great.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.514
Of course, Jessica used to be fun, too.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.850
That's why I started seeing her
after Katrina

12:47.933 --> 12:52.146
because Katrina was so mean and cynical,
and Jessica was sweet and full of life.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.231
Yeah, she sounds awesome.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.400
But, actually, now that I think about it,

12:56.484 --> 12:59.195
when I first met Katrina,
she was also full of life.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.864
Do you want another drink?
I'm going to get another drink.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.533
Oh, my God. What a weird coincidence.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.870
Why do all these idealistic,
vivacious women eventually turn bitter

13:07.953 --> 13:11.457
and cruel after being with me?
What's the common denominator?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.460
-[guests chattering]
-[laughter]

13:15.753 --> 13:16.879
Ugh. [sighs]

13:16.962 --> 13:18.964
-Hey, buddy.
-Ugh.

13:19.548 --> 13:22.718
The conga line leader
accidentally led us right into the pool.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.094
I've never felt so alive!

13:24.178 --> 13:26.138
-You should've been there!
-I want to go home now.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.600
-What? But this party is so fun!
-It's not fun for me.

13:29.683 --> 13:31.435
'Cause I don't know anyone here.

13:31.519 --> 13:35.147
Of course you do. Just-- BoJack!
You remember my wife Katrina.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.316
-Huh? No, I do not.
-This is going great.

13:37.399 --> 13:40.986
-I'm gonna go dry off. You two chat it up.
-No, Mr. Peanutbutter, please.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.154
[exhales]

13:42.655 --> 13:44.532
Thank you for hosting this party.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.408
So fun.

13:47.785 --> 13:50.287
-What's the story on the hat?
-It's a Blossom costume.

13:50.371 --> 13:54.250
Oh, shit, that's right! It's Halloween.
I need a costume! Good call, stranger!

13:54.333 --> 13:55.209
Ugh.

13:56.210 --> 14:01.590
So, I love parties, as you know,
but maybe we should go soon?

14:01.674 --> 14:05.761
There are so many famous people here,
it's actually making me kind of anxious.

14:05.845 --> 14:09.223
Diane! Famous people are just
like you and me.

14:09.306 --> 14:11.225
Well, like me, because I am one.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.395
Mom? No, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you tomorrow?

14:14.478 --> 14:16.772
Or is this the one night a year
you emerge from your crypt?

14:16.897 --> 14:19.358
Go introduce yourself.
I'm sure he'd love to meet you!

14:19.483 --> 14:22.152
-Or we could just go home?
-No, come on.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.655
It's Halloween,
a night to face your fears.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.323
That's why they call it Halloween!

14:26.407 --> 14:29.201
So, you can wean yourself off
of having fears!

14:29.285 --> 14:31.745
Say  "Hallo"  to weaning!

14:31.871 --> 14:32.746
[Diane whimpers]

14:33.539 --> 14:37.126
Okay. Todd's Hummer is now blocked in
by a blue Tesla.

14:37.209 --> 14:40.212
I'm looking for the owner of a blue Tesla.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.715
Studies say buying used is actually better
for the environment,

14:42.798 --> 14:46.135
but, hey, you tried,
and subsequently trapped me at this party!

14:46.218 --> 14:47.052
[both] Oh.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.345
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.391
-So, thanks for the new script pages.
-You got it.

14:52.474 --> 14:55.019
Hey, listen. That submarine scene...

14:56.395 --> 14:57.688
You wanna talk about it?

14:59.023 --> 15:00.065
-No?
-Okay.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.152
We'll just put that in the large bucket
of things we don't talk about.

15:03.235 --> 15:05.863
-What is that supposed to mean?
-That you didn't wanna talk about it.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.281
[groans, grunts]

15:10.200 --> 15:12.328
[gulps] This party sucks.

15:13.662 --> 15:15.164
Hey, doorman! I don't have a costume.

15:15.247 --> 15:17.791
And I don't wanna look stupid
at my own bitchin' Halloween party.

15:17.875 --> 15:19.919
Okay, I've got an idea.

15:21.253 --> 15:24.882
There. You're a one-night stand.
Get it? Nightstand?

15:24.965 --> 15:27.134
Nice! You should be a producer
or something.

15:27.217 --> 15:28.719
-Ha, ha. Yeah, right!
-[doorbell neighs]

15:28.802 --> 15:31.847
-But not yet. Keep manning the door.
-[sighs] Yeah.

15:32.973 --> 15:35.476
Ah! All dry! Sorry,
I got a little distracted on the way back

15:35.559 --> 15:36.977
by some people with a Ouija board.

15:37.186 --> 15:40.856
A dead soul told me to "AERXIXFASP"!

15:40.940 --> 15:43.108
-What could it mean?
-Cool.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.736
While you were gone,
Ben Stein introduced me to Tim Allen,

15:45.819 --> 15:48.572
and the three of us had a long debate
about government spending,

15:48.656 --> 15:50.991
which is exactly
how I wanted to spend my Halloween.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.577
-I am so sorry.
-Although, I have to say,

15:53.661 --> 15:56.622
now that your TV show has put us
into a new tax bracket,

15:56.705 --> 15:58.874
maybe we should start
paying attention more

15:58.958 --> 16:00.542
to how the government is using our money.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.002
-What?
-No, I don't know, ya know,

16:02.086 --> 16:04.546
I'm just saying
that a true capitalist-free market

16:04.630 --> 16:06.298
is actually, if you really think about it,

16:06.382 --> 16:10.052
more fair than an arbitrary redistribution
based on need.

16:10.135 --> 16:13.973
-This is from  Ten Minutes with Tim Allen?
-You left me alone for an hour and a half!

16:14.056 --> 16:15.849
I guess time flies
when you're having fun?

16:15.933 --> 16:19.436
-I am not having fun!
-[all gasping]

16:20.229 --> 16:21.063
[grunts]

16:24.233 --> 16:27.403
Hey, I need a costume.
I can't be costume-less at my own party.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.320
Mm.

16:28.696 --> 16:29.530
Hmm.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.448
-Follow me.
-[gasps]

16:32.324 --> 16:34.118
-Hold that. Now circle around here.
-Oh. What--

16:34.201 --> 16:36.078
-Okay. Just need some tape.
-No. What are-- Hey.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.247
No, I get that there's a smoke monster,

16:38.330 --> 16:40.708
but other than that,
it's just  Gilligan's Island,  right?

16:40.791 --> 16:42.501
-[groaning]
-[Peanutbutter gasps]

16:42.584 --> 16:43.961
Oh, thank you so much.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.130
No!

16:46.213 --> 16:48.132
-[woman gasps]
-[panting] Whoa!

16:48.215 --> 16:50.217
-[glass shatters]
-[grunts]

16:50.300 --> 16:51.635
[groans] Jessica!

16:51.719 --> 16:53.679
Am I written by Albert Hammond
and Diane Warren,

16:53.762 --> 16:56.807
originally recorded by Tina Turner,
but popularized by Ace of Base?

16:56.890 --> 16:58.892
Because "Don't Turn Around."

16:59.518 --> 17:00.477
[slo-mo] Huh?

17:00.561 --> 17:01.770
[groaning]

17:02.146 --> 17:03.981
[screaming]

17:04.064 --> 17:05.941
Mummy!

17:06.066 --> 17:08.068
[gong sound]

17:09.570 --> 17:10.612
What do you mean, a duel?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.032
-You mean like, like a duel, a duel?
-[clears throat]

17:13.115 --> 17:14.116
Hold on, somebody's--

17:14.783 --> 17:17.119
-Baby Bjorn Borg.
-Oh, my God. Yes!

17:17.202 --> 17:18.203
Cute. What do you want?

17:18.287 --> 17:21.457
Oh, um, I actually wanted
to introduce yourself.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.000
I mean myself. [chuckles]

17:23.083 --> 17:26.420
Obviously, you already know yourself,
so... [laughing]

17:26.503 --> 17:31.759
Oh, God. Listen, I just wanted to tell you
how much I loved  Horsin' Around.

17:31.842 --> 17:36.722
It was, like, a very formative part
of my childhood. So... thank you.

17:37.806 --> 17:40.768
I get a warm feeling every time
I think about the song.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.729
♪ Three little orphans,
one, two, three... ♪

17:43.812 --> 17:45.731
-I'm sorry. I'm on the phone right now.
-Oh.

17:45.814 --> 17:47.566
Uh... Sorry.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.986
Yeah, Mom, I'm still here.
No, it was nobody important.

17:51.904 --> 17:53.197
No, I get them to Glee Club.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.949
But why are they singing
when they're not in the Glee Club?

17:56.033 --> 17:58.494
Where's the music coming from?
Doesn't seem realistic.

17:58.577 --> 18:02.164
Why did you make me talk to BoJack?
I made a complete fool of myself.

18:02.247 --> 18:03.582
-No.
-I can't do this.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.000
I'm good in small groups.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.211
I'm great in chat-rooms
and message boards.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.630
-[shouts] But I hate big parties!
-[record scratches]

18:09.713 --> 18:10.881
-What? No!
-Yes!

18:10.964 --> 18:13.884
And I didn't wanna tell you because
I know how much this party means to you.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.345
[shouts] But I can't be more fun
than your ex-wives!

18:16.428 --> 18:17.846
It's too much pressure!

18:18.347 --> 18:19.348
I'm sorry.

18:19.431 --> 18:20.974
-[panting]
-[door slams]

18:21.391 --> 18:22.434
Uh-huh.

18:23.310 --> 18:25.979
-[music playing over stereo]
-Whoo! Uh-huh.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.607
-Hey, Pickles? I'm sorry.
-For what?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.609
I shouldn't talk
about my ex-wives so much.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.362
I don't want you to feel
like you have to be fun.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.780
But I am fun.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.116
It has nothing to do with you,
or your ex-wives,

18:37.199 --> 18:40.619
or your ex-wife Diane,
who is in this room right now.

18:40.702 --> 18:44.081
Okay, now I'm looking for the owner
of a blue Tesla,

18:44.164 --> 18:47.167
a red Maserati, and a gold helicopter.

18:47.709 --> 18:50.754
-Let's just get out of here.
-[crying] I don't wanna get out of here!

18:50.838 --> 18:53.841
-I'm having fun! This is fun for me!
-[record scratches]

18:53.924 --> 18:55.968
[sobbing]

18:57.427 --> 18:58.929
What's up with the waitress?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.057
You left me alone all night long!

19:02.141 --> 19:05.310
I ask so little of you!
And you never listen.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.229
I know, but now I am listening,

19:07.312 --> 19:10.065
and I swear I will stay by your side,
now and forever.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.819
I'll be on you like Urkel on Laura.
"Will I do that?"

19:14.069 --> 19:15.821
-Yes, I will.
-You know what? No.

19:15.904 --> 19:18.198
Because now I  want  to be alone.

19:18.282 --> 19:22.578
So, have fun hanging out with
all your hippie liberal friends, okay?

19:22.661 --> 19:24.830
-'Cause I'm going home.
-Kar-nina! Don't go!

19:24.913 --> 19:25.956
Ugh.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.000
-Party's over.
-All right, fine.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.294
Let's make this an annual thing,
though, okay?

19:30.377 --> 19:33.672
I wanna see all of you, back here,
next year! No matter what!

19:34.882 --> 19:36.717
I asked you to do one thing,

19:36.800 --> 19:39.136
keep me away from mummies.
And you couldn't even do that!

19:39.219 --> 19:40.345
Okay, in my defense,

19:40.429 --> 19:43.140
I am dressed like a giant notebook,
which severely limits my mobility!

19:43.223 --> 19:46.518
How do you think I felt when I had to do
that screen test all wrapped up in gauze?

19:46.602 --> 19:48.812
Wait. You were auditioning
to play the mummy?

19:49.897 --> 19:52.649
Mom, I gotta go. Okay?
I'll call you tomorrow.

19:52.733 --> 19:57.571
Yeah. We will figure out Dad's funeral.
And... I'm... I'm sorry.

19:57.654 --> 19:58.488
[phone beeps]

20:00.324 --> 20:03.785
-You! Boy! What's going on?
-I think the party's over, sir.

20:03.869 --> 20:04.703
[sighs]

20:05.704 --> 20:08.457
I always thought that when this happened,
I would feel something.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.542
I don't know what, but something.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.712
But I don't feel anything.
What's wrong with me?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.715
Nothing's wrong.
Just sometimes parties are over.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.133
[sighs]

20:18.508 --> 20:21.094
But... Hey, it doesn't have to be over.

20:21.178 --> 20:23.597
I mean, I could stick around
for a little bit.

20:23.847 --> 20:27.434
Yeah, sure, good idea.
Stick around for as long as you want.

20:27.517 --> 20:28.560
Yeah?

20:30.646 --> 20:31.897
Okay.

20:37.027 --> 20:39.112
I'm sorry I ruined
another Halloween for you.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.199
-You didn't ruin it.
-I really wanted you to think I was fun.

20:42.282 --> 20:45.535
Diane, you don't need to pretend
to be something you're not.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.371
-I already love you.
-What?

20:47.454 --> 20:50.666
And I'm going to love you,
no matter what version of you you are.

20:50.749 --> 20:52.960
So, you might as well give me
the real version.

20:54.544 --> 20:55.629
This is good.

20:55.921 --> 20:57.422
Now I know you don't like parties.

20:57.506 --> 20:59.758
So, we will never have
that argument again.

21:00.676 --> 21:01.802
Yeah.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.639
I really humiliated myself
in front of BoJack.

21:05.722 --> 21:07.224
-[engine]
-If it makes you feel better,

21:07.307 --> 21:10.435
I guarantee BoJack won't even remember
that he met you.

21:11.103 --> 21:11.937
Huh.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.734
Okay, new strategy.

21:17.818 --> 21:20.570
I'm looking for four
strong construction workers

21:20.654 --> 21:22.906
who can lift my car
and carry it out to the street,

21:22.990 --> 21:25.242
like in the Mentos commercial.
Any takers?

21:25.325 --> 21:26.535
[Peanutbutter] Open the door!

21:26.618 --> 21:28.203
[Pickles] Just leave me alone!

21:28.287 --> 21:30.664
What's going on in there?
Tough SAT prep course?

21:30.747 --> 21:31.957
Fail her learner's permit test?

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
Skirmish with the members
of the  Baby-Sitter's Club?

21:34.126 --> 21:35.836
-Nope.
-Shattered dreams of playing Adelaide

21:35.919 --> 21:37.796
in her high school's production
of  Guys and Dolls

21:37.879 --> 21:40.382
because the musical director sees her
as more of a Rusty Charlie?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.009
I don't know why this keeps happening.

21:42.092 --> 21:44.761
I take these amazing women,
like Pickles, like you,

21:44.845 --> 21:47.389
Katrina, Jessica, and I ruin them.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.598
Uh...

21:48.682 --> 21:49.975
I'm not  ruined.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.687
-No, I just mean... I don't listen.
-Okay, yes.

21:53.770 --> 21:56.315
It is definitely very annoying
how you don't listen.

21:56.398 --> 21:59.526
Thank you, but you don't have to say
nice things just to make me feel better.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.320
Huh? Okay, no.

22:01.403 --> 22:06.158
I was going to say you not listening
and I repeat, you don't listen,

22:06.241 --> 22:09.661
-that's not the only thing going on here.
-There are more things?

22:09.745 --> 22:12.289
-What do all these women have in common?
-They're mean?

22:12.372 --> 22:15.625
-When you first start dating them.
-They're fun?

22:15.709 --> 22:18.712
They're young.
You keep dating women in their 20s.

22:18.962 --> 22:20.547
I do, do that.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.717
They're not fully-formed yet.
Life changes people.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.136
-Well, not me.
-That's kind of my point.

22:26.219 --> 22:28.597
You don't ruin these women,
they just grow up.

22:28.680 --> 22:33.393
So, what you're saying is...
they all grow up, but I stay the same age?

22:33.477 --> 22:37.647
All right. All right. All right.
How do I fix that?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.983
Well, either you date someone older...

22:40.067 --> 22:43.487
-Ooooooor...
-Or, you grow up.

22:43.570 --> 22:46.198
Because otherwise,
they're gonna keep outgrowing you.

22:46.948 --> 22:47.991
Mind if I try?

22:53.246 --> 22:58.585
Okay, first thing we need to do
is sit you up and get you hydrated.

22:58.668 --> 22:59.753
Thanks.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.922
I understand what you're going through.

23:02.005 --> 23:05.509
I've been in your position before,
and this party is hard.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.010
[hiccups] It is!

23:07.094 --> 23:08.970
It's hard to be the new girlfriend.

23:09.054 --> 23:12.974
And to be at a famous person's house,
at an event with 25 years of history,

23:13.058 --> 23:15.936
and all these people
Mr. Peanutbutter has known for years.

23:16.019 --> 23:19.648
-[hiccups] Plus, you're here.
-Plus, I'm here.

23:20.023 --> 23:23.068
-What if I'm just a rebound?
-Mm.

23:23.276 --> 23:27.489
I was a rebound.
And he loved me, so much, for ten years.

23:27.572 --> 23:29.157
If there's one thing I know
about him,

23:29.241 --> 23:33.412
it's that he loves the person he's with
deeply and unconditionally.

23:33.495 --> 23:37.290
So, you don't have to worry about me,
because I'm not that person anymore.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.292
-You are.
-Aw. [chuckles]

23:40.001 --> 23:41.920
-[door opens]
-Oh!

23:43.338 --> 23:45.048
-[Pickles sighs]
-If you guys will excuse me,

23:45.132 --> 23:47.551
I'm just gonna take
this dickhole's helicopter home.

23:47.634 --> 23:49.261
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

23:49.344 --> 23:52.472
I'm actually really glad you went through
all those ex-wives

23:52.556 --> 23:55.183
because it means
I got the best version of you.

23:55.267 --> 23:59.271
-That's right. Version 4.0.
-Oh! I like the sound of that.

23:59.354 --> 24:02.065
Hey, you wanna just go home?
Hang out, just the two of us?

24:02.149 --> 24:05.569
Psh! No way! I just saw on Tweed Feed
that Josephine's ex, Tor,

24:05.652 --> 24:07.863
is throwing a monster shindig up in NoHo.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.239
Who-sephine's ex-what now?

24:09.322 --> 24:11.992
They have a two-story ice luge,
and a huge beer pond tournament.

24:12.075 --> 24:13.118
And I brought new costumes,

24:13.201 --> 24:15.829
so we don't have to look stupid wearing
the same in all our pictures.

24:15.912 --> 24:16.997
[laughs]

24:17.080 --> 24:18.540
I never wanna grow up!

24:18.790 --> 24:19.708
[chuckles]

24:20.459 --> 24:23.295
[sighs] Where's everybody going?
It's Halloween!

24:23.670 --> 24:25.464
[groaning]

24:28.008 --> 24:30.594
[door opens] Happy Hallowee-- What the?

24:31.678 --> 24:34.639
-Where is everyone?
-Hey, let's do this again next year.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.475
I'm going to bed.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.269
I love Halloween.
