WEBVTT

00:02.519 --> 00:03.555
Ohh, yeah!

00:11.356 --> 00:13.047
Who's got the power?

00:13.082 --> 00:14.531
♪ We got the power

00:16.775 --> 00:18.949
Who's got the power?

00:18.984 --> 00:20.572
♪ We got the power

00:20.606 --> 00:23.057
Oh! Yeah!

00:31.100 --> 00:34.965
Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Stealing this chrotaxium crystal

00:35.000 --> 00:38.072
was too easy
for the Bronze Boogie Boarder.

00:38.107 --> 00:39.625
Huh?
Whoaaaa...

00:39.660 --> 00:40.730
I'll take that.

00:40.764 --> 00:43.215
...whoaaaaa!

00:43.250 --> 00:44.734
Sorry.
I got distracted, girls.

00:44.768 --> 00:47.426
Crime-fighting in space
is a full-time job.

00:47.461 --> 00:49.221
This guy was easy.
Last week,

00:49.256 --> 00:52.569
I nearly got swallowed
by a Centaurian planet-eater.

00:52.604 --> 00:54.123
Sounds scary.

00:54.157 --> 00:55.538
It's okay, Bubbles.

00:55.572 --> 00:58.230
Those monsters are way out
in outer space.

00:58.265 --> 00:59.576
They can't come here.

00:59.611 --> 01:00.819
I am here!

01:00.853 --> 01:02.096
Huh?!

01:02.131 --> 01:04.581
Prepare for cleansing!

01:04.616 --> 01:06.100
Oh, sorry, girls.

01:06.135 --> 01:08.447
Didn't mean to scare you
with my new dust mask.

01:08.482 --> 01:13.107
Cleaning day! Cleaning day!
Cleaning day! Cleaning day!

01:13.142 --> 01:14.384
Ohhh.

01:14.419 --> 01:16.006
When you're done
talking to Bliss,

01:16.041 --> 01:17.663
make sure
you do your chores.

01:17.698 --> 01:20.770
Yes, Professor.

01:20.804 --> 01:24.118
Bath mat,
you shall be cleansed.

01:24.153 --> 01:25.430
Ooh! Gotta go.

01:25.464 --> 01:26.948
There's an emergency
in sector seven.

01:26.983 --> 01:28.812
Bye!ALL: Bye!

01:28.847 --> 01:30.297
Bliss goes on
all these awesome

01:30.331 --> 01:32.230
galactic crime-fighting
adventures,

01:32.264 --> 01:34.163
and we're stuck
doing chores?!

01:34.197 --> 01:36.406
I'll admit, crime-fighting
has been slow

01:36.441 --> 01:38.443
since Mojo
went on that cruise.

01:38.477 --> 01:41.446
At least he's sending us
all these postcards.

01:41.480 --> 01:46.796
"This message will self-destruct
in 3, 2, 1"?

01:48.004 --> 01:49.661
You know what?
I should go to space

01:49.695 --> 01:54.148
and fight cool monsters
withBliss inspace!

01:54.183 --> 01:57.600
Ha! You wouldn't last
one week in outer space.

01:57.634 --> 02:00.534
It's too scary for you,
what, with all the asteroids,

02:00.568 --> 02:03.640
and comets, and space monsters,
and black holes.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.160
You'd be running back home
in a minute.

02:06.195 --> 02:08.782
I bet you a bajillion dollars
I could do it.

02:08.818 --> 02:10.060
That's not even
a number.

02:10.095 --> 02:12.166
Hey, if you think
you'd lose...

02:12.201 --> 02:16.481
Fine! You're on.
One bajillion dollars.

02:16.515 --> 02:19.656
If you go, make sure
you send us some postcards.

02:21.693 --> 02:23.004
Well, I'm off.

02:23.039 --> 02:27.181
You know, a Neptunian
face-melter is loose on Pluto.

02:27.216 --> 02:29.666
A Neptunian
f-face-melter?

02:29.701 --> 02:31.323
Last chance
to chicken out.

02:31.358 --> 02:34.395
Just keep that
bajillion dollars warm for me.

02:34.430 --> 02:37.053
I don't want any
cold money.

02:37.087 --> 02:38.675
Later, dudes.

02:38.710 --> 02:40.021
Bye!

02:40.056 --> 02:42.196
I'll give her
two days.

02:42.231 --> 02:45.199
So, anyway, I flew to the
other side of the moon and --

02:45.234 --> 02:47.408
It's been three days
since Buttercup leeeft!

02:47.443 --> 02:49.514
Three days
since Buttercup leeeft!

02:49.548 --> 02:51.585
Agh!

02:51.619 --> 02:54.657
Sorry, Buttercup.
Please go on.

02:54.691 --> 02:57.384
So, I clocked
the evil space alligator,

02:57.418 --> 03:02.216
and I turned to him and said,
"See ya later...guy."

03:02.251 --> 03:04.667
Wow!
Great line.

03:04.701 --> 03:06.186
I have to admit,

03:06.220 --> 03:07.359
I thought
you would've gotten scared

03:07.394 --> 03:08.567
and crawled back home
by now.

03:08.602 --> 03:11.708
Yeah, but you forgot
one thing --

03:11.743 --> 03:13.020
I'm awesome!

03:13.054 --> 03:16.230
A few more days to go,
and I'm a bajillionaire.

03:16.265 --> 03:20.130
That means I win
and you lose!

03:20.165 --> 03:22.132
So, is Bliss around?

03:22.167 --> 03:24.238
I want to tell her
about my math quiz.

03:24.273 --> 03:26.344
Um, you know what?

03:26.378 --> 03:29.485
She's busy.
Um, gotta go. Bye!

03:30.279 --> 03:32.902
Phew!
That was ka-lose!

03:32.936 --> 03:36.077
I can't let Blossom know I
chickened out on going to space,

03:36.112 --> 03:38.528
or I'll be out
a bajillion dollars!

03:38.563 --> 03:42.636
And mama needs
that bajillion dollars.

03:42.670 --> 03:45.811
I just gotta hide out in
the garage a couple more days.

03:45.846 --> 03:47.606
Good thing
I gots plenty of comics

03:47.641 --> 03:51.369
and the professor's
patented meal sodas.

03:51.403 --> 03:55.580
Passghetti and meat-the-balls --
Mah fave.

04:01.793 --> 04:06.315
Ahh. Goes down smoove.

04:10.111 --> 04:13.632
We gotta hoof it, or it's
pinstriped pajamas for us.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.772
Frenchy!Oui, monsieur!

04:15.807 --> 04:18.464
Get me the chompers.

04:19.949 --> 04:21.985
The chompers!

04:22.019 --> 04:24.160
Aaah!

04:31.788 --> 04:35.620
I say, might I suggest
we find a place to lay low?

04:35.654 --> 04:39.658
I know the one place the coppers
won't think to look for us...

04:39.693 --> 04:41.971
the Powerpuff Girls'
house!

04:42.005 --> 04:45.181
Bubbles, I can't believe
you let Pauly in here.

04:45.215 --> 04:48.943
But look how cute
he is in his widdle hat!

04:50.566 --> 04:53.810
Well, you definitely shouldn't
have helped him tie us up.

04:53.845 --> 04:55.674
Do you not see his hat?

04:57.366 --> 04:59.160
Who said that?
Who's talking?

04:59.195 --> 05:01.024
Now, where's that
sister of yours --

05:01.059 --> 05:02.888
the one who's always
wearing gray?

05:02.923 --> 05:05.374
Buttercup?
I think you mean green.

05:05.408 --> 05:08.204
Look, lady, we're dogs.
We're colorblind.

05:08.238 --> 05:10.482
All of youse
wear gray to us.

05:10.517 --> 05:12.657
Now, tell me
Buttercup's whereabouts,

05:12.691 --> 05:14.866
or this'll happen
to youse.

05:16.039 --> 05:19.629
How is Schedulebot
going to vacuum the house nooow?

05:19.664 --> 05:22.080
You'll have to do a lot
worse to Schedulebot

05:22.114 --> 05:24.462
if you want us to talk.Gulp.

05:24.496 --> 05:26.567
We're not gonna
tell you anything.

05:26.602 --> 05:28.569
Buttercup
went to outer space.

05:28.604 --> 05:31.538
She's not gonna be home
for a couple of more days.

05:31.572 --> 05:33.402
Bubbles!I'm sorry,

05:33.436 --> 05:36.370
but am I the only one
who sees his tiny hat?!

05:37.889 --> 05:39.166
Cram it!

05:39.200 --> 05:41.237
Liver and onions?
No.

05:41.271 --> 05:43.550
Onions and liver?
Nope.

05:43.584 --> 05:45.690
Just onions?!
Ugh!

05:45.724 --> 05:47.554
I'm tired of
food in a bottle.

05:47.588 --> 05:49.521
I need some real food.

05:49.556 --> 05:50.867
Guess I'll have to
trick Bubbles

05:50.902 --> 05:52.835
into leaving pizzas
in the garage again.

05:52.869 --> 05:55.907
- Space to Bubbles!
- Space to Bubbles!

05:55.941 --> 05:57.702
Come in, Bubbles!

05:57.736 --> 05:59.842
"Hello,
Boot-er-coop,

05:59.876 --> 06:03.535
It is I,
your sister, Boo-blahs."

06:03.570 --> 06:04.571
Bubbles.

06:04.605 --> 06:06.055
Oh, what he said.

06:06.089 --> 06:08.437
Bubbles?
Are you okay?

06:08.471 --> 06:10.266
Is there someone else
there with you?

06:10.300 --> 06:12.924
Hang on.
He's still writing.

06:12.958 --> 06:16.410
"No. It's just the normal
amount of people in the house.

06:16.445 --> 06:17.791
I have to hang up now

06:17.825 --> 06:19.827
and go digging for bones
in the backyard."

06:20.932 --> 06:24.073
Hmm. Bubbles does like
digging for bones,

06:24.107 --> 06:26.247
but something ain't right here.

06:26.282 --> 06:28.353
I gotta check it out.

06:29.630 --> 06:32.288
They're all tied up!

06:32.322 --> 06:35.153
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!Pug-faced Pauly!

06:35.187 --> 06:37.258
And the vacuum's out!

06:37.293 --> 06:39.985
Buttercup, you gotta
save your family.

06:40.020 --> 06:41.262
But wait!

06:41.297 --> 06:43.092
If they find out
I didn't go to space,

06:43.126 --> 06:45.439
I'm out a bajillion dollars!

06:45.474 --> 06:48.891
And mama needs
that bajillion dollars.

06:53.309 --> 06:55.242
It's go time.

06:56.346 --> 06:58.970
The name of the game
is pinochle.

07:00.109 --> 07:01.731
Hey.
What was that?

07:01.766 --> 07:04.665
Bubbles, did you leave
the garage door open again?

07:04.700 --> 07:06.495
That's how
we get raccoons!

07:06.529 --> 07:08.945
I know.
That's why I did it.

07:08.980 --> 07:10.464
Dapper Dan Doberman,

07:10.499 --> 07:13.156
go find those raccoons
and plug 'em.

07:13.191 --> 07:15.607
With gusto.

07:15.642 --> 07:17.954
Now, see here,
you uncouth raccoons,

07:17.989 --> 07:22.303
come quietly and I'll
deal with you forthwith.

07:22.338 --> 07:24.340
Huh?
Show yourself.

07:24.374 --> 07:26.584
Who -- who goes there?

07:26.618 --> 07:29.310
Your worst nightmare.

07:29.345 --> 07:31.589
Aaaahhh!
No!

07:31.623 --> 07:33.314
Dapper Dan, come in.

07:33.349 --> 07:35.455
H-h-he's just not
answering, Boss.

07:36.801 --> 07:39.631
Oh, so there's
raccoons upstairs, too.

07:39.666 --> 07:42.807
He knows me too well.

07:42.841 --> 07:46.673
Terrier Triplets,
take 'em to the cleaners.

07:46.707 --> 07:48.502
On it, Boss!

07:53.334 --> 07:55.060
Closet's clear.

07:55.095 --> 07:56.614
Nothing's under the desk.

07:56.648 --> 07:58.167
Clear over here.

08:01.998 --> 08:03.517
Huh?

08:05.381 --> 08:07.832
Terrier Triplets?
Terrier Triplets?!

08:07.866 --> 08:10.317
Uh, Boss,
they ain't answerin'.

08:10.351 --> 08:13.838
I thought you said there weren't
nobody else in this house!

08:13.872 --> 08:14.839
We did.

08:14.873 --> 08:17.531
And I can't lie.
You're too adorable.

08:19.706 --> 08:21.846
Oof.
Listen up, gang.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.676
I want youse all
to search this whole potato.

08:24.711 --> 08:27.714
And if youse find anybody,
do this to them.

08:27.748 --> 08:29.854
Wha?

08:29.888 --> 08:33.340
Why was Schedulebot
programmed to feel paaaain?

08:36.481 --> 08:38.621
Huh? Huh?!

08:40.071 --> 08:40.899
Mugsy?

08:40.933 --> 08:44.420
Rocco? Frenchy?!
Aah! Aah.

08:44.454 --> 08:45.904
What happened to
your boys?

08:45.939 --> 08:48.044
I'm sure they're fine!Yeah!

08:48.079 --> 08:51.185
They're probably just having
a tea party with the raccoons.

08:55.604 --> 08:56.915
That's enough
outta youse.

08:56.950 --> 09:00.056
Now stay here
while I plug this problem.

09:01.264 --> 09:03.577
Gerald!

09:03.612 --> 09:05.890
Now to take care
of business.

09:05.924 --> 09:08.409
Huh?
Butt Sniffer, come on.

09:08.444 --> 09:09.963
That's obviously
a trap.

09:09.997 --> 09:12.931
Stay away from that trap,
Butt Sniffer.

09:12.966 --> 09:16.038
No! Don't even look
at that trap, Butt Sniffer.

09:16.072 --> 09:17.591
Ahhhhh...

09:17.626 --> 09:19.731
Boodius T. Sniffer!

09:22.320 --> 09:24.149
Butt Sniffer!

09:24.184 --> 09:27.808
Nooooooooo!

09:27.843 --> 09:31.122
Let the Utonium family go.

09:31.156 --> 09:32.295
Who is that?

09:32.330 --> 09:34.332
That voice
sounds familiar.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.714
It does?Who said that?!

09:36.748 --> 09:39.613
I ain't afraid of you.
I got the chompers!

09:39.648 --> 09:42.271
How about
we discuss this...

09:42.305 --> 09:45.067
over dinner?!

09:46.482 --> 09:50.106
Today is not
Schedulebot's daaaay.

09:50.141 --> 09:53.834
It will take more than that
to stop Pug-faced Pauly!

09:56.319 --> 10:00.496
You may got the bark,
but I got the bite!

10:02.394 --> 10:04.362
Sounds crazy out there.

10:08.884 --> 10:11.990
Ha! Ha...ha.

10:13.164 --> 10:15.545
Ugh! Ugh!

10:17.340 --> 10:18.790
Surprise.

10:18.825 --> 10:22.656
Ah! So it's you --
the gray one.

10:22.691 --> 10:25.659
Time to say,
"good bite!"

10:25.694 --> 10:27.799
Ahhhhh, ahhhh,
ahhh.

10:27.834 --> 10:29.042
Bad dog!

10:31.596 --> 10:33.322
G-g-g-get back!

10:33.356 --> 10:35.807
Bad dog. Bad dog!

10:35.842 --> 10:39.880
Sit. Heel!
Stop!

10:39.915 --> 10:41.675
What?

10:41.710 --> 10:43.297
What is that thing?

10:44.609 --> 10:47.198
G-g-get away!
Get away!

10:47.232 --> 10:48.682
Ahhhh!
Oh!

10:56.414 --> 11:00.038
You owe me
one bajillion dollars.
