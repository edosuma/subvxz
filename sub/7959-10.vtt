00:17.914 --> 00:21.304
"Ms. Windsor of the Board
Chair cum interim CEO

00:21.306 --> 00:26.201
"of the orchestra
has spent over $750,000

00:26.202 --> 00:31.289
on renovations
for her private office."

00:31.291 --> 00:33.912
- Yeah, yeah, not good.

00:33.914 --> 00:37.465
- They neglect to say
that I spent my own money!

00:37.466 --> 00:39.320
- Right, Gloria,
and we're really gonna try

00:39.323 --> 00:40.889
and definitely get
that in there, you know.

00:40.890 --> 00:44.472
- Oh, really? In a retraction
on page 23 of the Metro section?

00:44.475 --> 00:47.768
- I am so sorry, Gloria,
about the "New York Post" thing

00:47.770 --> 00:48.953
and the Biben thing

00:48.954 --> 00:50.584
and the whole
semi-betrayal thing.

00:50.585 --> 00:51.671
- You know what, Craig?

00:51.673 --> 00:52.951
You're gonna have to learn

00:52.954 --> 00:54.392
how to bet
on the right horse, okay?

00:54.393 --> 00:56.119
And I want to know who did this.

00:56.121 --> 00:58.904
- God, I don't know
how he has so much energy.

00:58.905 --> 01:02.009
- It's just so much easier
with a real baby, yes.

01:02.011 --> 01:04.152
Thank you for agreeing.

01:04.153 --> 01:05.334
- Oh, are you kidding?

01:05.337 --> 01:07.289
Virgil, Christophe,
I am so,

01:07.290 --> 01:09.432
so honored to be the godfather,
really, really.

01:09.433 --> 01:11.129
That's why I wanted
to bring this in person.

01:11.131 --> 01:12.953
Pavel, what's going on?

01:12.954 --> 01:15.962
- Almost done.

01:17.049 --> 01:18.745
- Hey.
- Ta-da.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.439
- Hey.
- You want to hold him?

01:20.442 --> 01:21.593
- Oh, please.

01:21.594 --> 01:23.129
Yes.

01:23.131 --> 01:24.600
- [humming]
- Okay, there we go.

01:24.603 --> 01:27.448
[all talking at once]

01:27.450 --> 01:29.816
- [sniffles]
- Hey.

01:29.817 --> 01:33.688
Maybe you're more tired
than you think, sweetie, hm?

01:33.691 --> 01:36.439
- No, no, it's, um--

01:36.442 --> 01:41.304
I love the New York
Symphony, I do.

01:41.305 --> 01:43.128
It's our home.

01:43.129 --> 01:45.367
I don't want anything bad
to happen to it.

01:45.370 --> 01:46.841
- Of course not.

01:46.843 --> 01:49.847
No, no, no, no, no,
we'll do everything, right?

01:49.849 --> 01:54.329
Everything we need to do
to keep the orchestra going.

01:54.331 --> 01:55.769
Look at that.

01:55.771 --> 01:57.593
You know, it's nice
that we're talking again.

01:57.594 --> 02:00.727
I kind of missed you,
eh, Sharon?

02:00.730 --> 02:02.615
- Yes, it seems like
a million years ago

02:02.617 --> 02:04.984
since we were sucking face in
the wings of the symphony hall.

02:04.986 --> 02:08.216
- Sucking face, that's just
such a horrible way to say it.

02:08.217 --> 02:10.745
I mean, what, am I a fish
with no feelings, or what?

02:10.747 --> 02:12.664
Why do you talk
to me like that?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.103
- Edward's this way.

02:14.105 --> 02:16.183
- So how long have you been
working with the Biben?

02:16.186 --> 02:18.039
- The Biben?
- Mm.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.480
- Longer than I worked for you.

02:19.483 --> 02:21.848
He's an incredible man.
- Yeah, incredible.

02:21.849 --> 02:23.161
Incredible at what?

02:23.163 --> 02:25.111
- He's incredible
at being incredible.

02:25.114 --> 02:26.711
- Say it again.
Say it again into my eyes.

02:26.713 --> 02:28.025
Go on.

02:28.026 --> 02:29.944
- He's incredible
at being incredible.

02:29.947 --> 02:31.512
- Where's Mr. Incredible?
Where is he?

02:31.514 --> 02:33.881
Where is he?

02:33.883 --> 02:36.504
- Sharon, how hot's it gonna
be in Beijing Thursday night?

02:36.507 --> 02:38.840
- High of 79,
low of 58 in the evening.

02:38.841 --> 02:40.824
- Am I still on for
the Newfoundland meeting?

02:40.825 --> 02:44.152
- Yes, we leave for
Tetterboro in 15 minutes.

02:44.155 --> 02:45.367
- It's Teterboro.
- Teterboro.

02:45.370 --> 02:46.807
- I've told you
that before, right?

02:46.810 --> 02:48.216
Oh, Rodrigo, good.

02:48.218 --> 02:50.168
Grab a harness, and clip in.
Patrick'll lift you up.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.151
- You have 14 minutes.
You can use his harness.

02:52.153 --> 02:54.487
- Give me 15, Sharon?

02:54.490 --> 02:56.633
Ay.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.264
- I hate doing
meetings up there.

02:58.265 --> 03:00.087
- Yeah, I can tell, yeah.

03:00.090 --> 03:02.906
- Ándale, papi. Ándale.
- Okay, oui, oui.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.754
- You with me?
- Yes.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.487
- Wow, that's not a great idea,
climbing without a harness,

03:10.490 --> 03:13.015
unless you're a master climber,
which I happen to be,

03:13.018 --> 03:14.264
but even I'm wearing
a harness

03:14.265 --> 03:15.865
'cause my potassium
level's low today.

03:15.866 --> 03:17.496
- Well, I'm not
a master climber at all.

03:17.497 --> 03:18.936
- Really?
- Yes.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.984
- Managed to climb
to the top of your profession.

03:20.985 --> 03:22.424
- It's not the top
of my profession,

03:22.425 --> 03:23.864
the New York Symphony, okay?

03:23.865 --> 03:26.264
It's not, but it's
the thing I love most.

03:26.265 --> 03:27.545
- Really?
- Yes.

03:27.546 --> 03:29.048
- You know, you got a funny way
of showing that.

03:29.050 --> 03:30.487
You spit in the face
of the people who pay for it.

03:30.490 --> 03:33.367
- The people-- I never
treated bad the people.

03:33.370 --> 03:35.256
- Oh, right, right,
corporations aren't people.

03:35.258 --> 03:36.536
Well, you know what?

03:36.538 --> 03:37.975
People aren't people.

03:37.978 --> 03:39.543
- Okay, I don't understand,

03:39.545 --> 03:42.008
but I know that the orchestra
is what matters right now most.

03:42.009 --> 03:43.704
So you want me out?
I resign.

03:43.706 --> 03:47.768
I resign only if--
- If?

03:47.770 --> 03:50.456
- If you give the orchestra
what they want:

03:50.457 --> 03:51.575
a new five-year contract.

03:51.578 --> 03:53.591
- And then you'll resign?
- Yes.

03:53.593 --> 03:57.879
You vote for the contract,
I quit, no strike.

03:57.882 --> 03:59.735
- Wow, okay.

03:59.737 --> 04:02.200
Would you be willing to sign
a three-year non-compete clause?

04:02.203 --> 04:04.599
'Cause I don't want you signing
up with another orchestra

04:04.602 --> 04:06.873
and making me look bad.

04:13.114 --> 04:15.127
- Argh.

04:15.129 --> 04:18.935
Okay, two years
and nine months?

04:18.937 --> 04:20.153
- Fine.

04:20.154 --> 04:21.942
- Good.
- Good.

04:21.944 --> 04:23.255
- Yeah, good.

04:23.257 --> 04:25.528
- Yeah, you want to wash my car?
- That's too much.

04:25.529 --> 04:27.447
- I'm just messing
with you, hermano.

04:27.449 --> 04:29.975
You got yourself a deal.
- Yes, Biben, yes.

04:29.978 --> 04:31.160
- Good.
- Good.

04:31.161 --> 04:32.887
Yeah, good.
[high-pitched ringing]

04:32.889 --> 04:34.552
- You all right?
[high-pitched ringing]

04:34.555 --> 04:35.959
[high-pitched ringing]

04:35.961 --> 04:37.625
What are you doing?
[high-pitched ringing]

04:37.627 --> 04:40.569
[high-pitched ringing]

04:44.922 --> 04:46.648
Aah! Whoa!

04:46.649 --> 04:49.144
- Maestro?
- I told you to wear a harness!

04:49.146 --> 04:51.832
Damn it. Gunter, on belay.
- Maestro?

04:51.834 --> 04:52.951
- Ay, Sharon?

04:52.954 --> 04:54.199
- No, Sharon, don't move him.

04:54.201 --> 04:55.161
- Sharon?

04:55.163 --> 04:56.250
- I love you.

04:57.850 --> 05:00.857
- Sharon?
- Yes?

05:00.858 --> 05:03.512
- It is so much easier
to go up than to come down.

05:03.514 --> 05:05.175
- Yes.
Don't move your head.

05:05.177 --> 05:09.815
- [singing in Spanish]

05:09.817 --> 05:12.185
- He's delirious.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.177
- How does that sound?

05:13.178 --> 05:15.447
- Like a children's lullaby?

05:15.449 --> 05:16.793
- But in tune?

05:16.795 --> 05:19.064
- Yes, it's in tune.
Relax your head, relax.

05:19.065 --> 05:21.303
- That was really nice.

05:21.305 --> 05:22.872
We still have a deal?

05:22.874 --> 05:25.911
- Do you know about--
about curses?

05:25.913 --> 05:27.353
No?

05:27.355 --> 05:28.314
You're it.

05:28.315 --> 05:29.560
[cell phone rings]

05:29.562 --> 05:31.351
- Gloria, I'm so glad
you called.

05:31.353 --> 05:32.824
- I called to say one thing,

05:32.826 --> 05:35.447
which is what we talked about
is no longer on the table.

05:35.449 --> 05:37.079
- Gloria, don't be hasty.

05:37.081 --> 05:39.127
This article thing
wasn't my idea, I promise you.

05:39.129 --> 05:41.752
- I don't give a damn
whose idea it was.

05:41.754 --> 05:44.792
I've given the last 20 years
of my life to this orchestra.

05:44.793 --> 05:47.512
You think you musicians
are the only people

05:47.514 --> 05:48.920
who live and breathe music?

05:48.922 --> 05:50.072
You're not!

05:50.074 --> 05:52.055
- Listen, listen,
let's you and I get together.

05:52.057 --> 05:53.911
We'll have a coffee,
and we'll figure this out.

05:53.913 --> 05:55.255
- If I had coffee
with you right now,

05:55.257 --> 05:56.504
I just may
throw it in your face.

05:56.505 --> 05:57.783
Good-bye.

05:57.786 --> 06:00.983
Now I'm gonna start
calling the board members.

06:00.985 --> 06:02.074
- Okay.

06:05.209 --> 06:06.298
- Fuck this.

06:08.377 --> 06:10.745
[flute music]

06:10.747 --> 06:12.055
- This Betty Cragsdale beyotch

06:12.057 --> 06:13.625
sounds like
she's not messing around.

06:13.627 --> 06:15.480
- No, no fucking kidding.

06:15.481 --> 06:17.432
- I think you could pick up
a thing or two from her.

06:17.434 --> 06:19.831
I mean, you know,
be ruthless too.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.136
- Yeah, be like,
"I will fucking kill you."

06:22.137 --> 06:24.375
- Yeah.
- Yeah, right? That was good.

06:24.377 --> 06:26.487
I--fuck it, I'm so
nonthreatening in general.

06:26.490 --> 06:28.793
- Well, maybe you
should threaten someone,

06:28.795 --> 06:30.355
'cause you're not going
to fucking Iowa.

06:31.225 --> 06:32.343
- I know.

06:32.346 --> 06:34.615
There's always Andrew Walsh.

06:34.617 --> 06:36.473
- The cello stud?
- Yeah.

06:36.475 --> 06:38.423
I could be part
of his ensemble.

06:38.425 --> 06:40.504
- Holy shit.

06:40.507 --> 06:43.512
- Maybe I could,
like, become a soloist.

06:43.514 --> 06:45.495
- This could fucking happen.

06:45.497 --> 06:48.696
- But there's only, like,
two oboists with solo careers.

06:48.697 --> 06:50.360
It's not like violinists.

06:50.362 --> 06:52.536
It's--it's different.
- So you'll be the third one.

06:52.538 --> 06:54.168
You'll just be one of them.

06:54.170 --> 06:59.959
- Sign here, here,
and initial here.

06:59.961 --> 07:02.648
- Okay, okay.

07:02.649 --> 07:07.062
Signing papers, that's all
I've been doing recently, right?

07:07.064 --> 07:08.439
Yeah.

07:08.442 --> 07:10.680
The deal is I sign this,

07:10.682 --> 07:12.855
and you give the orchestra
what they want, right?

07:12.858 --> 07:14.040
- That's what it says.

07:14.041 --> 07:17.783
- Okay, okay.
Okay, it is done.

07:17.786 --> 07:19.675
It is done.
Now you. Now you.

07:27.065 --> 07:28.792
- Sorry.

07:28.793 --> 07:30.391
- Right there
beside my name, yes?

07:30.394 --> 07:32.279
And another one

07:32.281 --> 07:36.630
and the third one
with initials, right?

07:36.632 --> 07:39.832
- [sniffling]

07:39.834 --> 07:41.271
- Oh, Jesus Christ,
stop blubbering.

07:41.274 --> 07:43.576
Call an emergency meeting of
the board negotiating committee.

07:43.577 --> 07:45.016
- Will do.

07:45.018 --> 07:47.031
- Cancel Guangzhou, egg
white wild mushroom frittata,

07:47.033 --> 07:48.504
Tabasco, no what?

07:48.505 --> 07:50.071
- No Tapatío.

07:50.072 --> 07:51.863
- No Tapatío.

07:51.865 --> 07:53.369
Good doing business
with you, Rodrigo.

07:53.370 --> 07:54.935
- The same, the Biben,
the same, the same.

07:54.937 --> 07:58.487
I feel very happy
with this negotiation, yes.

07:58.490 --> 08:00.696
So you deliver your part
of the bargain, okay?

08:00.697 --> 08:02.041
If not, the deal is off.

08:03.834 --> 08:05.050
- I always deliver.

08:09.434 --> 08:12.697
- Ay, Dios, ay.

08:14.168 --> 08:15.451
What to do?

08:16.889 --> 08:18.235
I don't know.

08:21.721 --> 08:24.600
I guess I'm no longer
the conductor

08:24.601 --> 08:25.591
of the New York Symphony.

08:25.593 --> 08:26.646
That's it.

08:26.649 --> 08:28.473
[sniffling]

08:31.961 --> 08:33.145
Sharon.

08:35.001 --> 08:36.727
Sharon,
what--what's wrong?

08:36.730 --> 08:38.393
What--why are you crying,
Sharon?

08:38.394 --> 08:39.894
- Because it's--
it's just not fair.

08:39.897 --> 08:41.015
- I know it's not fair!

08:41.018 --> 08:42.232
I know it's not fair!

08:42.235 --> 08:43.735
I--it's not fair,

08:43.736 --> 08:45.846
but is it fair that Mozart
was Mozart and Salieri Salieri?

08:45.849 --> 08:49.368
Huh? Is it fair
that Beethoven lost his ear?

08:49.370 --> 08:51.255
He couldn't hear, Sharon.
He couldn't hear.

08:51.258 --> 08:52.855
He couldn't
hear his "Ninth Symphony."

08:52.857 --> 08:54.486
I mean, how fucked up is that?

08:54.489 --> 08:56.823
Is it fair that Mahler
came to New York to conduct,

08:56.826 --> 08:58.552
and he just died?

08:58.554 --> 09:02.679
He died.
He fell ill, and he just died!

09:02.682 --> 09:04.216
- I know.

09:04.217 --> 09:07.195
I just think you were the best
conductor for our orchestra.

09:09.018 --> 09:10.298
- Thank you, Sharon.

09:13.114 --> 09:14.394
Yeah, me too, me too.

09:16.250 --> 09:18.486
- So thank you all for coming
for this emergency meeting

09:18.489 --> 09:19.673
of the executive
contract committee

09:19.674 --> 09:21.015
of the board
of New York Symphony.

09:21.018 --> 09:22.841
Gloria, thanks for being here.

09:24.345 --> 09:26.200
- I called the meeting.

09:26.201 --> 09:27.927
- Okay, technically.

09:27.929 --> 09:29.879
Come on in, Gloria.
Have a seat.

09:29.881 --> 09:32.249
I'm sorry if the decor in here
isn't quite up to snuff.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.816
We'll get to work
renovating it ASAP.

09:33.817 --> 09:35.418
[quiet laughter]

09:37.274 --> 09:39.767
- I would like to apologize
to my fellow board members

09:39.769 --> 09:41.080
for the article
in the "Times."

09:41.081 --> 09:43.320
It misrepresented the facts.

09:43.322 --> 09:45.080
- I'm sorry, what facts?

09:45.081 --> 09:47.480
There were just
so many facts in there.

09:47.481 --> 09:52.471
- I never used symphony money
to improve my offices.

09:52.474 --> 09:54.870
That was totally
all my own money,

09:54.873 --> 09:58.168
and I've donated substantially
more to the symphony

09:58.171 --> 10:01.111
than I spent decorating
my offices.

10:01.114 --> 10:02.711
- Yeah, you've donated
almost, what,

10:02.712 --> 10:05.559
1/8 of what
I did last year.

10:05.562 --> 10:06.744
- Hi.
- Hey.

10:06.745 --> 10:07.864
- Sorry I'm late.

10:07.865 --> 10:09.431
Flight was delayed
getting out of Cuba.

10:09.432 --> 10:11.480
- No problem, good to see you.
Have a seat, my man.

10:11.481 --> 10:16.120
So, folks,
we need to take a vote.

10:16.121 --> 10:19.511
I believe this recent article
changes everything,

10:19.514 --> 10:22.327
as does the news that I have
to share with the board.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.952
Gloria, I told you that
bringing Rodrigo DeSouza in

10:24.955 --> 10:26.392
was a mistake,
and you didn't listen.

10:26.394 --> 10:30.327
Well, now he's submitted
his resignation as conductor

10:30.330 --> 10:31.480
and musical director.

10:31.481 --> 10:32.727
- Wait, why?

10:32.730 --> 10:34.423
- Rumor is he's entering rehab.

10:34.424 --> 10:36.311
So, Gloria,
this was your big coup,

10:36.312 --> 10:38.711
bringing Rodrigo in,
wasn't it?

10:38.713 --> 10:40.150
It failed,

10:40.153 --> 10:42.456
and I'm also saying we should
bring back Thomas Pembridge

10:42.457 --> 10:44.471
as conductor
and musical director.

10:44.474 --> 10:46.327
- Do you think
the maestro would return?

10:46.330 --> 10:48.216
- Yeah, I've chatted with him.
I think he's amenable to it,

10:48.217 --> 10:49.687
and with Pembridge back,

10:49.688 --> 10:52.120
we can rebuild the bridges
to the corporate sponsors.

10:52.121 --> 10:53.847
Now, given the disastrous press

10:53.850 --> 10:55.735
and the chaos
within the administrative

10:55.738 --> 10:57.303
and the creative ranks,

10:57.306 --> 10:59.255
I move that we vote
to accept the orchestra's

10:59.258 --> 11:01.206
counterproposal,
and then I move

11:01.208 --> 11:02.648
that we vote
to begin a search

11:02.649 --> 11:04.600
for a new chairman
of the board,

11:04.601 --> 11:07.831
a search that
may not take too long.

11:07.832 --> 11:09.207
- Meaning you.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.384
- Well, I--I would be honored
to be considered.

11:11.385 --> 11:13.783
- All right, if there are
no further comments,

11:13.784 --> 11:17.943
then the seven voting members
of the committee may now vote.

11:17.946 --> 11:19.543
- Uh, just one moment, please.

11:19.544 --> 11:23.063
May I say a few brief things?

11:23.066 --> 11:25.174
The first thing is,

11:25.177 --> 11:26.711
Edward, you're a shit.

11:26.713 --> 11:28.951
I should have never
have let you onto the board.

11:28.952 --> 11:31.607
The second thing
is I know you blackmailed

11:31.610 --> 11:34.200
Rodrigo DeSouza into resigning.

11:34.201 --> 11:37.303
- Okay, well, that's not true,
but regardless--

11:37.306 --> 11:40.600
- Regardless, I will say
I've been listening to you

11:40.601 --> 11:42.104
over these last few months,

11:42.105 --> 11:44.407
and you've been saying
that the orchestra should build

11:44.408 --> 11:49.529
and protect its endowment
to secure its financial future.

11:50.298 --> 11:52.344
I've come to agree with you.

11:52.346 --> 11:54.870
I would like to accede
to the orchestra's demands,

11:54.873 --> 12:00.567
but not at the cost
of the orchestra's future.

12:00.570 --> 12:04.408
This--this is bigger
than you and me

12:04.409 --> 12:09.913
or the individual players
or the great...

12:11.577 --> 12:12.792
I repeat,

12:12.793 --> 12:16.312
the great Rodrigo DeSouza,

12:16.313 --> 12:19.320
so we must vote now

12:19.322 --> 12:23.224
to reject
the orchestra's demands,

12:23.225 --> 12:25.559
and as far as chairmanship
of the board,

12:25.562 --> 12:28.855
I'm happy to step down
in three years,

12:28.857 --> 12:31.414
after we have successfully
navigated our way

12:31.417 --> 12:33.847
through this difficult time.

12:33.850 --> 12:38.838
And I do believe the next
board chair is in this room,

12:38.841 --> 12:44.504
but, Edward, it'll be you
over my dead body.

12:47.673 --> 12:51.414
So let's vote.

12:51.417 --> 12:52.504
- Let's.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.486
- All right,
of the seven voting members,

12:54.489 --> 12:57.977
how many vote to accept
the orchestra's counter offer?

13:00.345 --> 13:02.871
One, two, three.

13:02.874 --> 13:05.336
- Hey, Erik,
I don't think you heard.

13:05.337 --> 13:09.177
- How many vote to reject
the orchestra's demands?

13:13.304 --> 13:16.152
- Uh, you're voting
against me?

13:16.153 --> 13:17.847
- Gloria is
very persuasive.

13:17.850 --> 13:20.278
- Uh, wait,
do you think you're gonna be

13:20.280 --> 13:21.879
the next board chairman?

13:21.881 --> 13:26.552
- Well, I'd be honored to be
considered... in three years.

13:26.553 --> 13:28.086
- Erik, what the hell?

13:28.088 --> 13:31.511
I brought you onto
this board, you know.

13:31.514 --> 13:33.366
I mean,
your dad was my best man.

13:33.369 --> 13:34.870
Christ, you're a kid.

13:34.873 --> 13:36.567
- I'm sorry, Ed.

13:36.570 --> 13:39.831
I just think you're a little
too emotional about this.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.847
[classical music]

13:41.850 --> 13:44.056
- Open the damn door, Pavel.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.775
- I am sorry,
but this is a lockout, okay?

13:46.778 --> 13:49.270
This is a lockout, okay?

13:49.273 --> 13:54.006
The reason this is a lockout
is that you are locked out,

13:54.009 --> 13:56.152
but I will join you
in the picket lines

13:56.153 --> 13:57.399
as soon as I can.

13:57.402 --> 13:59.032
- Our stuff is
in our lockers, man.

13:59.033 --> 14:00.663
- It's happening.
Shit.

14:00.666 --> 14:02.488
- Jesus, it really is happening.

14:02.490 --> 14:03.735
- Those sons of bitches.

14:03.736 --> 14:05.176
- Where's Cynthia?
- Where's Nina?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.486
- Yeah, where's Nina?
Where's our ass-kicker?

14:06.489 --> 14:08.344
- This is what the board
wanted from the get-go.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.615
- Does this mean we don't get
paid for this performance?

14:10.618 --> 14:12.535
- Not just this performance,
you idiot.

14:12.538 --> 14:13.912
We may not ever get paid again.

14:13.913 --> 14:15.831
- Hey, cut the defeatist
talk, all right?

14:15.833 --> 14:17.368
- What are you talking about?
- There's no reason to get--

14:17.370 --> 14:18.934
- It's not defeatist.

14:18.937 --> 14:20.152
- We don't have to get--

14:20.153 --> 14:21.113
[all yelling at once]

14:21.115 --> 14:23.258
- Quiet.

14:24.953 --> 14:27.129
I'm as upset about this
as you are...

14:28.953 --> 14:31.000
But we all knew
this was a possibility, right?

14:31.001 --> 14:32.696
- Tell us something
we don't know.

14:32.697 --> 14:33.975
Where the fuck is Nina?

14:33.977 --> 14:35.254
- Hey, leave her alone, Betty.

14:35.256 --> 14:36.600
She's doing the best she can.

14:36.601 --> 14:38.426
Yeah, but where is Nina, though?

14:39.705 --> 14:41.143
- I fired her.
- What?

14:41.144 --> 14:42.711
- Without asking us?

14:42.713 --> 14:46.200
- You know, Nina was
right about a lot of things,

14:46.201 --> 14:48.822
but she was wrong
about one big thing.

14:48.825 --> 14:51.255
She thought we were children,

14:51.258 --> 14:54.297
that we couldn't be trusted
to make our own decisions.

14:55.161 --> 14:58.455
We are world-class musicians.

14:58.456 --> 15:00.918
We have chosen this
to be our lives.

15:00.921 --> 15:05.399
We have chosen a profession
which is hard on relationships,

15:05.402 --> 15:07.672
which is hard on our bodies,

15:07.673 --> 15:10.456
which requires constant practice
and dedication,

15:10.457 --> 15:12.953
which practically no one
else can understand.

15:14.874 --> 15:16.888
This is a difficult vocation,

15:16.889 --> 15:19.414
but I ask you now,

15:19.417 --> 15:22.041
how many of you
would choose a different one?

15:23.898 --> 15:25.687
[all murmuring]

15:25.688 --> 15:27.735
- You know, we're tougher
than they think we are.

15:27.738 --> 15:29.815
In there, they think
we're a bunch of kooky,

15:29.817 --> 15:32.183
eccentric,
weak-kneed musicians,

15:32.186 --> 15:34.934
but we are goddamn warriors,

15:34.937 --> 15:37.783
and we're gonna win this fight
by showing them just

15:37.784 --> 15:39.321
how tough we really are.

15:40.472 --> 15:41.754
Follow me.

15:42.713 --> 15:43.864
- Come on.

15:43.865 --> 15:45.942
You heard her, come on.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.655
- Fuck this. I have shit in
my locker, God damn it.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.577
- I can't--I'm with you!

15:53.337 --> 15:54.519
- Let's go.

15:54.522 --> 15:57.591
[stirring classical music]

16:02.874 --> 16:05.751
- My dear orchestra,

16:05.754 --> 16:09.750
I have wanted
to be your new conductor

16:09.753 --> 16:13.816
ever since the day
I became your old conductor.

16:13.817 --> 16:14.904
Yeah.

16:17.562 --> 16:19.673
What in God's name is going on?

16:30.426 --> 16:32.634
[cell phone buzzing]

16:41.274 --> 16:43.385
[cell phone buzzing]

16:45.561 --> 16:47.032
- Michel.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.176
- Maestro, the board voted
to lock out the orchestra.

16:49.177 --> 16:51.894
- What? The--but the Biben--

16:51.897 --> 16:53.751
- He didn't come through.

16:53.754 --> 16:55.318
The deal's off.

16:55.321 --> 16:56.919
- Wait, wait, wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a second.

16:56.922 --> 16:59.158
Wait a second.
Okay, I'm on my way.

16:59.161 --> 17:00.311
I'm on my way.

17:00.312 --> 17:01.687
- B, check this out.
I edited photos

17:01.688 --> 17:03.158
of the New York Symphony
at three-year increments--

17:03.160 --> 17:04.406
- That's awesome,
but we got to go.

17:04.410 --> 17:05.751
They got locked out,
the orchestra.

17:05.752 --> 17:07.288
- Shit, what?
- They're on the move right now.

17:07.289 --> 17:08.280
Let's go. Come on, come on,
get the camera.

17:08.281 --> 17:09.304
Let's go, it's real.

17:13.785 --> 17:15.832
- Elizabeth, this is epic.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.654
This is epic.
All right, this is epic.

17:17.656 --> 17:19.096
Elizabeth, you got this?
You stay there.

17:19.097 --> 17:21.047
I'm gonna get it on this side,
all right? This is epic.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.423
Oh, my gosh.

17:22.424 --> 17:24.182
- Hailey!
Hailey Rutledge,

17:24.184 --> 17:26.838
star substitute oboist
for the New York Symphony,

17:26.839 --> 17:28.440
how do you feel
about the lockout?

17:28.442 --> 17:29.911
- Pissed.
Please stop filming.

17:29.913 --> 17:31.990
- All right, what are you
doing giving an interview?

17:31.992 --> 17:33.688
Go on, get them.
- Bye.

17:33.690 --> 17:36.151
- Knock 'em dead.
- I need four over there.

17:43.673 --> 17:44.886
- Guess this whole
strike kind of

17:44.888 --> 17:47.607
throws a wrench
in your blackmail plan.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.270
- Does put some
spin on it.

17:49.272 --> 17:50.488
Maybe I'll take
the Iowa job.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.022
That Reg makes
a good omelet.

17:52.025 --> 17:53.335
- Why are you like this?

17:53.336 --> 17:55.926
- You mean, how can I
betray my fellow musicians?

17:55.929 --> 17:58.072
Well, how could you
take my solo?

17:58.074 --> 18:00.406
- It's not your solo.
It's Beethoven's solo,

18:00.409 --> 18:01.943
and you were already injured.

18:01.945 --> 18:03.638
- It's not your
fucking call, dearie,

18:03.641 --> 18:04.694
and don't blame Beethoven.

18:04.696 --> 18:05.751
You knew what you were doing.

18:05.753 --> 18:07.960
Just admit it, all right?

18:07.961 --> 18:11.191
- All right, if you admit
that you were a shit.

18:11.192 --> 18:14.103
- Deal.
I was a shit.

18:14.105 --> 18:16.314
Now get your head in the game.
We have a concert.

18:17.176 --> 18:18.711
- Welcome, everyone.

18:18.713 --> 18:21.174
We're gonna do this,
I guess, without a conductor,

18:21.176 --> 18:23.991
so, uh, Warren,
would you do the honors?

18:23.993 --> 18:25.398
- No one knows
what the future brings,

18:25.401 --> 18:27.030
but the excitement is mounting

18:27.032 --> 18:29.143
as the orchestra gathers
itself like a bull in the ring

18:29.144 --> 18:31.159
with picador swords stuck
in its shoulders--

18:31.161 --> 18:34.072
- Orchestra, hello,
my orchestra.

18:34.074 --> 18:35.830
- It's the maestro.
I think we got the maestro.

18:35.833 --> 18:37.335
The maestro's coming.
- It's the maestro.

18:37.336 --> 18:38.519
- Thank you.

18:38.521 --> 18:40.182
- The maestro is here.
- Maestro, any--

18:40.184 --> 18:42.327
Any comments about the lockout?
Any comments about the lock--

18:42.329 --> 18:43.384
- Yes, only one comment,
only one comment.

18:43.385 --> 18:44.823
- Yes?
- This orchestra lives!

18:44.825 --> 18:46.105
- This orchestra lives.

18:47.608 --> 18:49.079
- Thank you so much.

18:49.082 --> 18:51.222
It's lovely out here, right?
- Yes.

18:51.224 --> 18:52.631
- We should do
this more often.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.199
Sorry, no, okay, well,

18:54.201 --> 18:56.982
there is no wine for sale
in the lobby,

18:56.984 --> 18:59.287
but I'm sure that you guys
can get some if you want some,

18:59.288 --> 19:03.767
but there is a hot dog man
over there if you want, okay?

19:03.769 --> 19:07.481
Friends, family, neighbors,
this is your orchestra.

19:09.560 --> 19:10.560
We're musicians.

19:12.122 --> 19:16.056
This orchestra consists
of fathers and sons

19:16.057 --> 19:20.598
and grandparents,
mothers, brothers, sisters.

19:20.601 --> 19:21.654
I owe you one.

19:21.656 --> 19:25.686
I owe you one, yes,

19:25.689 --> 19:28.346
and you've been there
for me a lot.

19:32.634 --> 19:37.241
At least for me,
I find myself at home with you.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.122
This is my home.

19:42.873 --> 19:46.265
This is our home.
- That's right.

19:49.080 --> 19:51.736
- [speaking Spanish]

19:51.738 --> 19:54.521
Okay, let's--are we ready?

19:59.704 --> 20:02.457
[speaking Spanish]

20:11.353 --> 20:14.423
["Ravel: Daphnis Et Chloe Suite
No. 2: Lever Du Jour" plays]

20:41.977 --> 20:43.288
- He's done it.

20:43.289 --> 20:45.464
He's just fucking well
gone and done it.

20:47.856 --> 20:51.439
- And what have I done?
I jeopardized everything.

20:51.441 --> 20:52.623
- You did the best you could.

20:52.625 --> 20:53.584
We all did.

20:53.586 --> 20:57.807
- What if I killed
the thing I love most?

20:57.809 --> 21:00.976
- You can't kill that, darling.

21:00.978 --> 21:03.823
It was here a long time
before us,

21:03.825 --> 21:07.921
and it'll be here a long time
after we're gone.

21:56.528 --> 21:57.934
- "Hai Lai."
- Hi.

21:57.936 --> 22:00.335
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Of course.

22:00.336 --> 22:02.223
- Are you going somewhere?

22:02.226 --> 22:03.727
- Yeah.
- Where are you going?

22:03.729 --> 22:06.126
- Um...

22:06.128 --> 22:09.393
I'm going on tour
with Andrew Walsh.

22:10.769 --> 22:11.790
- Andrew Walsh?

22:11.792 --> 22:12.880
- Yeah.

22:12.882 --> 22:14.222
- "Hai Lai," no, no.

22:14.224 --> 22:15.982
Andrew Walsh is not
worthy of anything

22:15.984 --> 22:17.967
related to you
at all, at all.

22:17.969 --> 22:20.463
Sexually, definitely not,
but artistically, even less.

22:20.465 --> 22:22.702
- I'm not going to sleep
with him, don't worry.

22:22.704 --> 22:24.208
- He's very persistent,
you know?

22:24.210 --> 22:27.310
- I--I think that
I could kick his ass.

22:27.313 --> 22:29.169
- Yeah, I'm sure
you can, yeah.

22:32.945 --> 22:34.224
You're different, "Hai Lai."

22:37.552 --> 22:40.654
Yeah, like,
there's more thorns,

22:40.656 --> 22:42.702
you know, in the rose,
but it's still--

22:42.704 --> 22:44.432
still very beautiful.

22:46.320 --> 22:48.270
- You're different too.

22:48.272 --> 22:49.585
- Really?

23:03.376 --> 23:04.656
- I have to go now.

23:06.032 --> 23:08.494
- "Hai Lai,"
okay, wait, wait.

23:08.497 --> 23:12.047
- I'm not going to Europe
just yet, so--

23:12.048 --> 23:13.328
- No?

23:16.401 --> 23:18.096
- Hi.
- Hi, Hailey.

23:19.986 --> 23:21.166
- Maestro.
- Yes.

23:21.169 --> 23:22.575
- Surprised
to see you here.

23:22.576 --> 23:23.951
- Yes.
- [speaking Spanish]

23:23.952 --> 23:27.022
- Sí, sí.
[speaking Spanish]

23:27.025 --> 23:28.528
- This all?
- That's all, yeah.

23:28.529 --> 23:29.776
I don't have
that much ski gear.

23:29.778 --> 23:31.086
- Yeah, that's all right,
no problem.

23:31.088 --> 23:32.750
There's plenty of stuff
at the cabin.

23:32.752 --> 23:33.903
- Great.

23:33.904 --> 23:36.464
- Hey, Maestro,
I'm sorry about the lockout.

23:37.266 --> 23:38.926
- Yeah, me too.

23:38.929 --> 23:41.008
Were you there when--
when the voting happened?

23:41.009 --> 23:42.510
- Yes, I was.

23:42.512 --> 23:45.550
You know, obviously, I voted for
what the orchestra asked for,

23:45.552 --> 23:48.080
but unfortunately,
that didn't work out.

23:49.969 --> 23:51.823
You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

23:51.825 --> 23:53.201
- Good to see you.
- Yeah.

23:59.119 --> 24:00.402
- Good-bye, Rodrigo.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.351
How do I get in?
- Okay, you ready for this?

24:06.353 --> 24:07.121
- Yeah.

24:07.123 --> 24:09.807
- Slightly annoying, right?

24:09.809 --> 24:11.441
- No, it's amazing.
