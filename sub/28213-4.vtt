WEBVTT

00:00.336 --> 00:05.540
This place teach me
not always better to survive.

00:05.736 --> 00:07.660
We have never accepted
civilian patients.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.660
When it comes to my son,
I'll accept any advantage.

00:10.660 --> 00:14.460
I'll find out anything. Anyone.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.420
Who asked you,
the family or the police?

00:16.420 --> 00:20.060
What are you working on with Maggie?
The press and the police.

00:20.060 --> 00:21.300
Who's she?

00:21.300 --> 00:24.580
You have an idea about us,
don't you? You'll get hurt.

00:24.580 --> 00:25.860
I'm already hurt.

00:25.860 --> 00:28.460
You want to be the most
powerful person in the country.

00:28.460 --> 00:29.820
Oh, I think it's required of me.

00:29.820 --> 00:31.940
Can she win?
She'd need all our support.

00:31.940 --> 00:33.940
She's dangerous. Dangerous to you.

00:33.940 --> 00:36.060
You're romantically involved
with a homeless man.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.100
His name's Scott.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.060
Stay here alone? It's not about you.

00:40.900 --> 00:42.980
There must be another role
we can find in your business.

00:42.980 --> 00:44.660
If he's not going to run
the business,

00:44.660 --> 00:45.820
he can't be in the business.

00:45.820 --> 00:47.620
He's got nothing else.
He has nothing else!

00:47.620 --> 00:50.060
Then he needs to find
something else.

00:52.460 --> 01:00.460
This programme contains
very strong language

03:00.020 --> 03:01.380
What about medication?

03:01.380 --> 03:02.980
He's refusing antidepressants.

03:02.980 --> 03:04.460
Well, he's not allowed to refuse.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.180
Caden must give his consent.

03:06.180 --> 03:08.980
I'm his mother! I give MY consent.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.940
I'll sign whatever papers.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.620
If he refuses, we'll force him.

03:52.620 --> 03:55.900
He won't train, he won't study,
he won't write. Yeah.

03:55.900 --> 04:00.500
He won't speak. When I speak to him,
he doesn't listen.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.020
His eyes, they're dead.

04:03.780 --> 04:06.140
We're losing him. What do they say?

04:06.140 --> 04:07.420
There's nothing they can do.

04:07.420 --> 04:09.980
Nothing? There's never nothing -
I don't accept that.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.700
But, I mean, it's not their fault.

04:11.700 --> 04:13.700
Patients need something to live for.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.980
They need a reason to get out of bed
in the morning.

04:15.980 --> 04:18.100
An army, a country.

04:18.100 --> 04:19.420
I mean, what does Caden have?

04:19.420 --> 04:20.579
He has us.

04:20.579 --> 04:23.660
But he's not going to get better
for us. I can't motivate him.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.220
I can't fix him.

04:25.220 --> 04:28.140
Nor can you.
He's got to find that from inside.

04:28.140 --> 04:29.540
He doesn't have it.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.180
I made a terrible mistake.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.380
Please.

05:34.980 --> 05:36.220
Please.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.140
OK, he can't run your business.

05:54.140 --> 05:57.820
He's never going to run your
business. He'll accept that. No.

05:57.820 --> 06:01.220
But can't we create him a new role?

06:01.220 --> 06:02.420
I'll think about it.

06:02.420 --> 06:04.860
Your charity work,
or something international.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.300
You know, something in that team?
I mean, that's something good,

06:07.300 --> 06:09.580
it's something different...
You think those jobs are easy,

06:09.580 --> 06:10.860
or softer?

06:10.860 --> 06:12.700
Do you suggest something?

06:12.700 --> 06:14.300
A fake job...

06:14.300 --> 06:16.700
..with a fake title in an office
somewhere where the phone

06:16.700 --> 06:19.660
never rings, with an assistant
he doesn't need?

06:19.660 --> 06:22.300
Would Caden...?
Would he even believe it?

06:22.300 --> 06:23.580
He's fading away.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.860
What can I offer him

06:28.860 --> 06:31.460
after I offered him the world?

06:31.460 --> 06:34.540
He had it right there in his hands,
he could have done anything.

06:34.540 --> 06:35.820
And now he can't.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.820
And he's depressed.

06:38.820 --> 06:41.220
I would be depressed,
you would be depressed.

06:41.220 --> 06:44.060
But he doesn't know how to live
without you.

06:44.060 --> 06:46.140
He's free of me now.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.420
He's got to figure it out.

06:49.820 --> 06:50.900
Save him.

06:56.340 --> 06:57.940
I don't know how.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.740
It's here. Just wait there.

08:38.740 --> 08:40.460
Scott?

08:40.460 --> 08:42.179
We'd like to talk to you.

08:42.179 --> 08:43.620
Fuck off.

08:49.220 --> 08:51.180
Shit. Where is he?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.380
Where the hell is he?

09:19.140 --> 09:20.220
Scott?

09:28.420 --> 09:29.860
OK. It's just here, mate.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.740
Come on. Let's get you inside.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.100
I tried.

10:34.860 --> 10:36.460
It's not your fault.

10:38.340 --> 10:39.780
You did nothing wrong.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.340
I was broken long before you.

10:45.820 --> 10:47.220
Yeah, you were fixed, too.

10:52.620 --> 10:53.900
It's not easy...

10:56.540 --> 10:59.020
..being the best part
of someone's life.

11:00.460 --> 11:03.620
Like you're responsible
for their happiness.

11:08.140 --> 11:11.500
There wasn't a second when
I didn't think it would end.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.420
What if I told you
I needed your help?

11:19.780 --> 11:21.260
What could you need from me?

11:23.260 --> 11:25.980
You put your life back
together from nothing.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.300
You were sober, you'd recovered.

11:30.300 --> 11:31.740
That man has gone.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.340
Well, can you find him?

11:39.460 --> 11:40.820
I can try.

11:41.820 --> 11:45.980
My son's at a rehabilitation centre
near here.

11:45.980 --> 11:47.660
He's given up.

11:47.660 --> 11:51.300
He won't listen to me,
he won't listen to anyone.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.100
You know, what do
I know about despair?

11:53.100 --> 11:55.580
What do I know about having nothing?
But you know.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.460
YOU beat it.

12:00.260 --> 12:02.340
What are you asking me to do?

12:02.340 --> 12:03.740
Talk to him.

12:03.740 --> 12:05.100
Tell him it's possible.

12:06.380 --> 12:07.780
And that's why you found me?

12:10.740 --> 12:14.380
Yes. Not because you were
concerned about me? I was concerned.

12:14.380 --> 12:15.460
But that's not why.

12:18.540 --> 12:19.700
No.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.180
How bad is he?

12:28.820 --> 12:30.340
He's dying.

12:48.540 --> 12:49.580
Caden?

12:55.180 --> 12:56.540
Caden?

12:59.620 --> 13:00.780
Caden?

13:17.780 --> 13:19.420
I'd like you to meet my friend.

13:20.980 --> 13:22.380
His name is Scott.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.780
Hi...Caden.

13:35.460 --> 13:37.900
I'm Scott.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.740
I-I'm a friend of your mum.

13:43.860 --> 13:46.300
I've been homeless for three years.

13:50.340 --> 13:52.020
Not easy to talk about.

13:54.700 --> 13:56.020
I lost everything...

13:57.860 --> 14:00.140
..my job in finance...

14:01.540 --> 14:04.220
..my house, my wife.

14:06.860 --> 14:11.060
I don't even own the clothes
I'm wearing.

14:11.060 --> 14:13.060
Y-Your...

14:13.060 --> 14:15.820
Your mum got them for me.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.140
You fucked Mum.

14:40.980 --> 14:42.780
We were together for a time.

14:42.780 --> 14:45.340
We're friends. No.

14:45.340 --> 14:47.060
It is, i-it's the truth.

14:47.060 --> 14:49.700
No, you fucked...

14:49.700 --> 14:50.980
..YOUR mum.

14:58.740 --> 15:01.260
You fucked your mum.

15:01.260 --> 15:03.740
Caden, cut it out.

15:03.740 --> 15:07.180
Look... Caden. ..he knows.

15:07.180 --> 15:10.900
Scott has come here to talk
to you... He knows.

15:10.900 --> 15:13.340
..about his... He stole her money...

15:15.580 --> 15:19.820
..and spent it on the stock market

15:19.820 --> 15:22.140
to cover his losses.

15:24.140 --> 15:25.740
She is old.

15:28.300 --> 15:31.060
You tricked her,

15:31.060 --> 15:33.500
lost her house.

15:33.500 --> 15:37.300
Now, she lives poor and alone.

15:38.340 --> 15:41.620
You fucked your mum.

15:42.940 --> 15:45.980
And you fucked MY mum.

15:47.140 --> 15:49.660
You are a motherfucker.

15:49.660 --> 15:51.020
OK, let's take a break.

15:52.740 --> 15:55.500
You are a mother...

15:55.500 --> 15:58.220
Stop! You lie! You lie!

15:58.220 --> 16:01.060
You're lying! You're bloody lying!
Calm down!

16:01.060 --> 16:02.820
Get him out of here!

16:02.820 --> 16:04.580
I'll take him out the way.
Just calm down.

16:04.580 --> 16:05.980
You know.

16:05.980 --> 16:09.820
YOU KNOW!
What is wrong with you?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.220
What are you doing?!

16:17.260 --> 16:18.500
Who are you?

16:54.140 --> 16:55.180
I'm sorry.

16:56.420 --> 16:57.460
I lost control.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.220
I have no excuse.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.860
I warned you - he says anything.

17:03.860 --> 17:05.099
He has no filter.

17:07.859 --> 17:08.900
How is he?

17:10.940 --> 17:12.460
He'll be fine.

17:25.859 --> 17:28.099
What I'm about to say
is not an excuse.

17:29.660 --> 17:31.340
There are no excuses.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.860
What he said in there...

17:35.860 --> 17:36.900
..is true.

17:41.340 --> 17:42.860
It's the worst thing about me.

17:45.540 --> 17:49.500
It's one thing I've never been able
to accept about myself.

17:52.220 --> 17:53.340
And how does he know?

17:54.700 --> 17:57.100
Well, I told you over and over -

17:57.100 --> 17:58.780
he says outrageous things.

17:59.820 --> 18:02.340
About us, sleeping together.

18:04.860 --> 18:06.380
About my mum.

18:10.100 --> 18:11.180
No-one knows.

18:13.060 --> 18:16.460
Kathryn, she doesn't even know.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.580
She thinks it was
the run of bad luck.

18:21.340 --> 18:23.660
I hid it from everyone...

18:23.660 --> 18:25.260
..cos I should be in jail.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.980
I should be locked up
for what I did to her.

18:29.980 --> 18:31.860
I stole from my mum.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.340
I can't see her again,
knowing how I cheated her.

18:35.340 --> 18:36.820
And no-one knows.

18:40.220 --> 18:43.940
Kathryn, if no-one knows,
how does your son know?

19:05.060 --> 19:06.820
Who did you annoy?

19:06.820 --> 19:09.500
Well, for a politician, I'm not
always good at the politics.

19:09.500 --> 19:11.380
That could be a problem.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.740
Not for my electorate.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.500
Erm, you sat on a parliamentary
select committee

19:15.500 --> 19:18.220
that looked into the practices
of the press. I did.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.460
And give them a clean bill
of health.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.060
I made some recommendations.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.580
Minor stuff.

19:23.580 --> 19:27.060
I've learned over many years,
you do what you can.

19:28.380 --> 19:30.220
What were your real findings?

19:31.580 --> 19:33.980
Well, why don't you tell me yours?

19:33.980 --> 19:36.860
We're investigating,
among other things,

19:36.860 --> 19:40.300
the illegal acquisition of
confidential information.

19:40.300 --> 19:44.340
Intercepted data, phone calls,
hacked voicemail,

19:44.340 --> 19:47.420
faked e-mails, sabotage, blackmail -

19:47.420 --> 19:50.860
all carried out by
a nationwide network

19:50.860 --> 19:53.980
of private detectives
operating outside of any laws.

19:53.980 --> 19:55.980
Without any oversight.

19:55.980 --> 19:59.140
Working so closely
with the real police

19:59.140 --> 20:01.500
that there's no meaningful
distinction between them.

20:01.500 --> 20:05.300
Providing loyal MPs with damaging
information on their opponent.

20:05.300 --> 20:09.100
While having their own damaging
revelations ghosted away.

20:09.100 --> 20:13.020
A network that protects anyone
on the inside and attacks anyone

20:13.020 --> 20:14.540
on the outside.

20:17.660 --> 20:18.820
Well.

20:20.300 --> 20:22.740
Anyone can tell a story.

20:22.740 --> 20:24.500
Why don't you tell us yours?

20:28.340 --> 20:31.260
A man and a woman walk into a garage

20:31.260 --> 20:34.300
with a wheelbarrow
full of loose parts.

20:34.300 --> 20:37.420
They tell the mechanic
they want to sell him a car.

20:37.420 --> 20:39.780
They just need someone to put
all the parts together.

20:39.780 --> 20:44.620
The mechanic politely points out
that they don't have a car.

20:46.100 --> 20:48.580
They just have
a wheelbarrow full of junk.

20:51.060 --> 20:52.380
Will you help us?

21:02.020 --> 21:03.420
What's in your file?

21:05.260 --> 21:07.100
Craig?

21:07.100 --> 21:08.780
What have they got on you?

21:17.140 --> 21:19.060
A whitewash for a whitewash?

21:19.060 --> 21:21.660
No-one would ever accuse a man
in an office like this

21:21.660 --> 21:23.060
of being corrupt, would they?

21:23.060 --> 21:25.740
Maybe you're better at the politics
than you like to admit.

21:25.740 --> 21:27.460
What are you hoping to achieve?

21:28.820 --> 21:31.460
You might be able to pick off
some low-lying fruit,

21:31.460 --> 21:34.900
a few private detectives,
a few crooked police officers,

21:34.900 --> 21:38.980
they lose their job,
you ruin their lives.

21:38.980 --> 21:42.420
Might even ruin the life
of a politician or two.

21:42.420 --> 21:43.780
So what?

21:45.300 --> 21:49.980
You want change, there's only
one way. And what way is that?

21:49.980 --> 21:53.980
You need someone from the very
top of that organisation to talk.

21:53.980 --> 21:55.980
An insider, whistle-blower.

21:55.980 --> 21:59.940
Someone who can lay it all out,
testify on record.

22:01.140 --> 22:05.660
And why would such a person,
if they existed, ever talk to you?

22:24.620 --> 22:27.260
Oh, er... Which one? That one. OK.

22:32.700 --> 22:33.980
All right.

23:13.900 --> 23:15.180
I was seven years old

23:15.180 --> 23:19.060
when we visited our relatives
in Ghana for the first time.

23:19.060 --> 23:22.620
Outside of Tamale in the north
of the country. Uh-huh?

23:22.620 --> 23:25.100
When we returned to England,
I said to my father,

23:25.100 --> 23:27.780
"Why do we never visit
the English countryside?"

23:27.780 --> 23:29.020
Do you know what he said?

23:30.260 --> 23:32.660
"We wouldn't be welcome."

23:32.660 --> 23:35.900
Mm. I loved my father very much,

23:35.900 --> 23:38.820
but I refuse to say those words
to my children.

23:40.020 --> 23:43.700
Ah, it's a shame he never
saw you become Prime Minister.

23:43.700 --> 23:46.620
He was with me the night
I was elected as an MP.

23:46.620 --> 23:48.820
Came to the Houses of Parliament.
Yeah?

23:48.820 --> 23:53.020
Standing in that chamber, he took
my hand like he were my child

23:53.020 --> 23:54.940
and I was his father. Ah.

23:56.420 --> 24:00.700
Well, if you'll forgive me,
it was a long time ago.

24:00.700 --> 24:02.180
Yes, it was.

24:04.460 --> 24:05.860
You've had ten years.

24:08.060 --> 24:11.420
It's a lot to ask a country
for another five.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.180
15 years of one man.

24:14.780 --> 24:17.580
How many years has the country
had of you, Max?

24:19.220 --> 24:22.580
Angela is already running one
of the most divisive campaigns

24:22.580 --> 24:24.020
this country has ever seen.

24:24.020 --> 24:27.820
She might argue a divisive campaign
for a divided country.

24:27.820 --> 24:32.060
She's telling people, good people,
fair-minded people,

24:32.060 --> 24:34.860
that something has been
taken from them.

24:34.860 --> 24:38.740
That other people's achievements
have come at their expense.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.620
Not that we can rise up together,

24:40.620 --> 24:43.660
but that to rise,
someone else must fall.

24:43.660 --> 24:45.980
When you won your seat
in Parliament,

24:45.980 --> 24:48.740
you made your family part
of your campaign.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.220
I never intended to run
for a third term.

24:51.220 --> 24:53.700
Oh, your sense of duty compels you?

24:53.700 --> 24:58.100
Yes, it does. It actually does, Max.
Can you believe that?

24:58.100 --> 25:00.420
It's not about what you want.

25:00.420 --> 25:01.740
What do the people want?

25:02.820 --> 25:07.220
Tolerance won't put food on the
table, or a roof over their head.

25:07.220 --> 25:10.420
People are hungry, Prime Minister.

25:11.780 --> 25:14.900
And some believe that you are more
concerned

25:14.900 --> 25:16.900
with trying to win
the Nobel Peace Prize.

25:17.940 --> 25:19.620
Max...

25:19.620 --> 25:23.100
..are you actually considering
endorsing her?

25:26.700 --> 25:28.100
Might be just so.

25:31.380 --> 25:32.500
Yeah.

25:36.500 --> 25:37.860
Your kids here?

25:37.860 --> 25:39.940
Thank you.
No, they're not with us today.

25:41.020 --> 25:42.340
No?

25:42.340 --> 25:45.500
Well, I hear that Saif is just
starting at Cambridge,

25:45.500 --> 25:48.380
that's amazing.
Mmm. Congratulations. To everybody.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.540
He's studying to be a doctor. Yeah.

25:51.540 --> 25:53.300
We hardly see him any more.

25:53.300 --> 25:55.380
He prefers it that way,
he's much happier.

25:55.380 --> 25:58.660
Well, he's a remarkable young man.

25:58.660 --> 26:03.060
It can't be easy,
following in his father's footsteps.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.860
Why do you say that?
Well, for the last ten years,

26:05.860 --> 26:09.740
every journalist has been
waiting for you to slip up.

26:09.740 --> 26:11.220
Scandals...

26:12.380 --> 26:16.420
..human failings,
apparently, you have none.

26:16.420 --> 26:18.180
I was allowed none.

26:19.940 --> 26:21.940
Must be hard,

26:21.940 --> 26:23.740
for a son to have a perfect father.

26:23.740 --> 26:28.380
Yes. Being the son of
a prominent father is hard.

26:46.660 --> 26:47.860
You've given up.

26:49.060 --> 26:50.220
Right?

26:51.340 --> 26:52.380
Right?

26:55.340 --> 26:58.180
It's pretty clear you want
the whole world to know...

26:59.660 --> 27:01.780
..you're done.

27:01.780 --> 27:04.100
End of the road, finished.

27:04.100 --> 27:06.140
I can't do this.

27:06.140 --> 27:07.500
I get it.

27:09.060 --> 27:10.580
I understand.

27:15.540 --> 27:16.860
So, let's do it.

27:18.020 --> 27:21.100
Let's fucking do it,
me and you, right now.

27:21.100 --> 27:22.660
Do... Do what?

27:23.660 --> 27:25.140
Die.

27:27.620 --> 27:29.260
Really?

27:29.260 --> 27:31.860
Are you... Are you serious?

27:33.500 --> 27:34.820
Are you?

27:36.580 --> 27:39.580
You... You want to die?

27:43.460 --> 27:45.340
What do YOU want?

27:56.860 --> 27:58.780
What do we do?

28:25.500 --> 28:26.700
That should be enough.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.340
Put it around your head.

28:40.620 --> 28:43.020
You know we won't be able
to surface,

28:43.020 --> 28:44.540
unless we unclip our weights?

28:46.060 --> 28:47.580
What about you?

28:50.980 --> 28:52.420
I want to know too.

28:53.500 --> 28:54.900
Ready?

31:49.500 --> 31:51.620
Will you be here when I wake up?

31:52.700 --> 31:53.820
No.

31:55.340 --> 31:56.700
Then I won't sleep.

31:58.100 --> 31:59.140
You're tired.

32:03.540 --> 32:07.300
I want to...stay up all night.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.420
Talking.

32:11.620 --> 32:12.820
What'll we talk about?

32:19.220 --> 32:21.020
Do you have family?

32:25.740 --> 32:27.180
None that visit.

32:28.740 --> 32:30.460
I joined the army to have a family.

32:32.540 --> 32:34.820
How will you...feel?

32:36.220 --> 32:37.460
About?

32:39.260 --> 32:40.820
Us two, tomorrow.

32:43.940 --> 32:45.580
I don't feel anything.

32:50.580 --> 32:53.420
No, I...don't believe you.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.380
We had sex.

32:57.380 --> 32:58.860
And tried to kill ourselves.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.780
I've done that with a lot of guys.

33:02.780 --> 33:04.740
You were my first.

33:07.100 --> 33:08.500
I warned you.

33:09.580 --> 33:12.100
About? Getting hurt.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.020
I'm already hurt. Not like this.
Like what?

33:15.020 --> 33:16.380
You've never been in love.

33:22.580 --> 33:24.020
No.

33:27.820 --> 33:29.460
No, I've never been in love.

33:33.940 --> 33:35.020
You should.

33:37.420 --> 33:38.980
You'd be great at it.

33:43.660 --> 33:44.860
But not with me.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.500
It's...

33:55.500 --> 33:57.420
It's been a...

33:57.420 --> 33:59.460
..long time since I've...

34:00.660 --> 34:02.740
..looked forward to tomorrow.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.980
You don't have to keep me around.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.540
Do you want to leave?

34:33.540 --> 34:34.659
No.

34:36.380 --> 34:37.699
Well, it's a big house.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.100
Why don't you stay?

34:42.820 --> 34:43.980
Till you're ready.

34:45.980 --> 34:47.420
I could do with the company.

34:58.980 --> 35:00.740
I'd like to talk to Caden again.

35:04.500 --> 35:06.460
Yeah, I don't think
that's a good idea.

35:09.100 --> 35:11.500
I owe him an apology.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.020
He won't give you one.

35:14.540 --> 35:15.980
Been thinking about that.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.660
It was his job.

35:20.740 --> 35:22.980
To find out other people's secrets.

35:22.980 --> 35:26.260
He investigated me when he knew
we were seeing each other.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.460
Yeah.

35:29.860 --> 35:32.140
You asked me here
to help you with your son.

35:33.980 --> 35:36.060
I'm telling you, a-as a friend...

35:37.540 --> 35:39.580
..you don't get it.

35:39.580 --> 35:40.620
Do you?

35:42.580 --> 35:44.060
This isn't about my secrets.

35:45.380 --> 35:46.900
This is about his.

35:49.860 --> 35:53.860
Give it everything. That's it,
that's good. That's really good.

35:53.860 --> 35:55.620
Keep going, it's all you.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.380
Keep going.

36:01.780 --> 36:03.860
OK. Back down. Back down.

36:05.340 --> 36:06.660
That's great.

36:06.660 --> 36:08.020
OK, keep going.

36:10.660 --> 36:12.100
Hi.

36:12.100 --> 36:15.300
He's doing really well.
I'm really pleased.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.060
Hi. Hi!

36:38.740 --> 36:41.700
I never meant to hurt you.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.780
I know that.

36:43.780 --> 36:46.580
I've hurt...so many...people.

36:47.860 --> 36:50.300
B-But now I want to love someone.

36:54.820 --> 36:57.460
H-Her name is...Orla.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.060
It's a nice name.

37:02.460 --> 37:05.380
I know...e-everything

37:05.380 --> 37:07.580
about everyone,

37:07.580 --> 37:09.740
but I know nothing about her.

37:12.740 --> 37:14.580
Does she love you? No.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.460
But you hope?

37:20.220 --> 37:21.420
Yes.

37:23.020 --> 37:24.580
I hope, Mum.

37:26.020 --> 37:27.940
I am...hopeful.

37:30.100 --> 37:32.180
That's good!

37:32.180 --> 37:34.140
I worry, too.

37:34.140 --> 37:35.900
About?

37:35.900 --> 37:37.740
The things I've done.

37:42.860 --> 37:44.220
What things?

37:46.820 --> 37:50.660
If she knew...what I'd done...

37:50.660 --> 37:52.820
What have you done?

37:52.820 --> 37:55.540
..then no-one could love me.

37:57.060 --> 37:58.140
Caden.

38:00.700 --> 38:01.980
What have you done?

38:06.500 --> 38:09.460
I-I have...ruined people.

38:17.140 --> 38:20.500
I-I have
ruined people.

38:22.100 --> 38:23.220
What does that mean?

38:24.940 --> 38:26.620
You've ruined people?

38:26.620 --> 38:28.340
Found out everything.

38:29.740 --> 38:31.740
But that was your job.

38:31.740 --> 38:33.260
Not like this.

38:33.260 --> 38:36.540
No rules, no laws.

38:36.540 --> 38:37.900
Did anything.

38:39.540 --> 38:41.140
He tells her everything.

38:46.820 --> 38:47.980
How does she react?

38:49.340 --> 38:51.100
She's confused.

38:52.780 --> 38:54.620
She thinks HE'S confused. She's...

38:56.660 --> 38:58.260
..not sure what to believe.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.420
She doesn't believe it yet.

39:06.340 --> 39:07.500
She will.

39:09.460 --> 39:10.700
Can I speak freely?

39:12.580 --> 39:14.620
Your son...

39:14.620 --> 39:16.140
..can't be trusted.

39:20.580 --> 39:21.620
No.

39:23.420 --> 39:24.940
He's a threat, Max.

39:28.420 --> 39:31.900
Six weeks ago,
my son suffered a stroke.

39:33.620 --> 39:37.220
It's a parent's duty to look
after their kids.

39:37.220 --> 39:38.620
Protect them.

39:39.700 --> 39:41.300
And I failed.

39:41.300 --> 39:43.700
No...Dad, I failed.

39:45.100 --> 39:46.140
No, you didn't.

39:47.420 --> 39:49.580
Give me that...

39:49.580 --> 39:50.860
There you go.

39:57.220 --> 39:59.540
No...Dad, I failed.

40:02.500 --> 40:04.780
..to look after their kids.

40:04.780 --> 40:06.500
Protect them.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.100
And I failed.

40:08.100 --> 40:10.380
No...Dad, I failed.

40:16.580 --> 40:18.100
Keep going.

40:20.140 --> 40:22.020
Good girl!

40:23.340 --> 40:24.580
Found it!

40:25.780 --> 40:28.540
Yeah! Yeah!

40:31.540 --> 40:35.380
Mummy...! She took it off her
travel bag.

40:35.380 --> 40:36.900
Well, you can have it.

40:36.900 --> 40:37.940
Of course you can.

40:40.340 --> 40:44.260
But...we need to change
the name inside.

40:44.260 --> 40:47.140
Don't we?! Yeah! Yes!

40:47.140 --> 40:48.180
Hmm?

40:50.820 --> 40:52.260
Change your name.

40:53.460 --> 40:56.660
You want to be just like Mummy,
don't you? Yeah!

40:56.660 --> 40:57.700
Yes!

40:59.860 --> 41:03.620
You're going to be someone
different, aren't you? Yep.

41:03.620 --> 41:05.580
Someone better. Yeah!

41:33.660 --> 41:35.300
Why are you so down on yourself?

41:39.300 --> 41:40.700
What if I told you

41:40.700 --> 41:43.260
my papers were considering
endorsing Angela?

41:44.860 --> 41:48.140
I'd tell you a lot of people are
going to vote for her. Like who?

41:48.140 --> 41:49.980
People like me.

41:49.980 --> 41:51.860
If I was still cleaning offices.

41:51.860 --> 41:54.980
Mum, you never would
have voted for her. I don't know.

41:54.980 --> 41:57.300
If I was...still in my 30s,

41:57.300 --> 41:59.580
earning nothing...

41:59.580 --> 42:02.460
..I'd be crying out that things
needed to change.

42:02.460 --> 42:04.060
It can't go on like this.

42:04.060 --> 42:05.780
Living on so little.

42:05.780 --> 42:08.260
And she's the only one listening.

42:08.260 --> 42:11.060
She claims she's not a politician.

42:11.060 --> 42:12.540
Well, people like that about her.

42:12.540 --> 42:16.140
A businesswoman who ended up
in politics by accident. Right?

42:20.100 --> 42:21.820
What if she always wanted power?

42:23.940 --> 42:26.020
What if power was the plan
all along?

42:26.020 --> 42:30.140
Her businesses were never about
profits, they were about ideas?

42:30.140 --> 42:33.220
They were a platform to launch
her political career.

42:33.220 --> 42:35.620
That would make her someone
very determined.

42:42.300 --> 42:44.180
There aren't many men in your
position

42:44.180 --> 42:46.140
who would have made the journey.

42:46.140 --> 42:49.060
Well, I had a feeling that
you'd be showing me

42:49.060 --> 42:51.500
something more than
a spotless factory floor.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.620
I hope you don't a mind short walk.

42:54.620 --> 42:56.980
Oh, we're not going inside?

42:56.980 --> 42:58.620
This is more than just a factory.

43:00.100 --> 43:01.500
It's a place to work, yes.

43:02.860 --> 43:04.460
It's also a place to live.

43:06.100 --> 43:07.980
So you built all these?

43:07.980 --> 43:10.180
On land no-one wanted. Ah.

43:10.180 --> 43:12.700
For people no-one cared about.

43:12.700 --> 43:14.300
It's a home.

43:14.300 --> 43:16.900
A good family home for £80,000.

43:16.900 --> 43:19.100
And all your employees get a house?

43:19.100 --> 43:21.940
Oh, after completing a full year,
all my colleagues can apply to...

43:21.940 --> 43:24.820
Colleagues? Yeah, I call them
colleagues rather than employees.

43:24.820 --> 43:28.820
So this...this application
process involves what?

43:30.900 --> 43:33.340
Well, you have to earn the right
to move into one of these homes.

43:33.340 --> 43:35.060
A-ha. Morning.

43:35.060 --> 43:37.420
Yeah, to prove themselves?

43:37.420 --> 43:39.180
Is that what you mean?

43:39.180 --> 43:41.180
Loyalty, dedication.

43:42.220 --> 43:46.180
These are men and women who can't
get credit, can't get loans.

43:46.180 --> 43:49.140
I'm the only one that's ever
trusted them.

43:49.140 --> 43:50.740
What if it goes wrong?

43:50.740 --> 43:51.980
If they lose their jobs.

43:53.100 --> 43:56.500
People don't lose their jobs
when it's also their livelihoods.

43:56.500 --> 43:58.620
Of course they do!

43:58.620 --> 44:02.420
Things fall apart,
people... People lose everything.

44:02.420 --> 44:04.740
What are you going to do,
evict them?

44:04.740 --> 44:06.140
It's never happened.

44:06.140 --> 44:07.740
No, but could you do it?

44:07.740 --> 44:10.620
Could you tell a family to leave,
make them homeless?

44:12.580 --> 44:16.740
The people I help know exactly what
I'd do if they ever let me down.

44:16.740 --> 44:18.300
Look at our productivity rates -

44:18.300 --> 44:21.100
this country has
some of the worst in Europe.

44:21.100 --> 44:23.020
My companies have some of the best.

44:26.980 --> 44:30.380
You know, you sound a lot more
like a benefactor than a boss.

44:32.180 --> 44:35.140
It's not enough to say to people,
"Here's your money.

44:35.140 --> 44:37.860
"Sorry there's nowhere to live,
sorry there's a housing crisis

44:37.860 --> 44:39.940
"but that's not my problem." Hm.

44:39.940 --> 44:42.820
Their problems ARE my problems...
Mm. ..and I won't sit on

44:42.820 --> 44:45.420
the sidelines and hope someone else
comes up with a solution.

44:47.020 --> 44:49.740
Maybe that's why I got into politics
in the first place.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.580
Maybe.

44:54.580 --> 44:57.340
People often ask me
what my investment philosophy is -

44:57.340 --> 44:59.300
I don't have one. Mm.

44:59.300 --> 45:01.340
I have instincts.

45:01.340 --> 45:05.540
I need to walk around a problem,
I need to pick it up, feel it.

45:05.540 --> 45:09.300
I can't do things from far away,
I don't do theory.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.380
What does that mean,
you don't do theory?!

45:13.020 --> 45:15.660
I can't solve problems
by reading a book.

45:16.860 --> 45:19.460
I don't have any idea how to fix
the Middle East peace process -

45:19.460 --> 45:21.020
I don't live there.

45:21.020 --> 45:24.420
How would I know? I know Britain,
I know my home... Mm.

45:24.420 --> 45:25.700
..I know my people.

45:25.700 --> 45:29.100
Well, countries are connected,
people are, too.

45:29.100 --> 45:30.740
Maybe they don't want to be.

45:38.740 --> 45:40.580
The houses are lovely.

45:40.580 --> 45:41.780
Do any of you live there?

45:41.780 --> 45:44.380
No.
No. Oh.

45:44.380 --> 45:45.860
You don't like them?

45:45.860 --> 45:47.140
We're contractors.

45:47.140 --> 45:49.500
You have to be employed
by the factory to get a house.

45:49.500 --> 45:51.620
You have to be a colleague.

45:51.620 --> 45:53.700
And who else is a contractor?

45:53.700 --> 45:55.460
Uh, cleaners, security.

45:56.460 --> 45:58.260
Is everything OK?

45:58.260 --> 45:59.940
Yeah, everything's fine.

46:08.020 --> 46:11.420
I like my news...to be right.

46:11.420 --> 46:13.020
As in, correct.

46:15.580 --> 46:16.740
Right for who?

46:17.940 --> 46:19.460
The people who buy it.

46:19.460 --> 46:22.380
The people who make it possible,
by watching it,

46:22.380 --> 46:23.580
consuming it.

46:24.700 --> 46:26.900
I work for them,
I don't make them work for me.

46:29.180 --> 46:32.660
A news channel that's always on your
side... Mm-hm. ..always your friend.

46:33.780 --> 46:36.060
News that's never going
to call you stupid

46:36.060 --> 46:37.700
or criticise your faith, or...

46:38.860 --> 46:40.260
..make you feel small.

46:41.500 --> 46:43.100
Except...

46:44.020 --> 46:47.020
..our regulations won't allow it.

46:47.020 --> 46:48.060
Not on TV.

46:51.900 --> 46:53.260
I parted ways...

46:54.380 --> 46:57.460
..with an editor of mine once -
terrific guy, had to let him go.

46:59.100 --> 47:00.700
Under his stewardship,

47:00.700 --> 47:03.660
sometimes the paper criticised
the government,

47:03.660 --> 47:05.980
sometimes it praised
the government, and I said,

47:05.980 --> 47:08.940
"Wait, wait a minute,
this is confusing.

47:08.940 --> 47:10.260
"Which side are you on?"

47:11.500 --> 47:13.420
He says to me, "The side of truth."

47:13.420 --> 47:14.940
Hm.

47:14.940 --> 47:17.540
"And truth is uneven,
unpredictable."

47:17.540 --> 47:19.860
And I went, wait, no, no, no,
wait a minute!

47:19.860 --> 47:21.980
No, that is not THE truth.

47:21.980 --> 47:23.540
It's a brand of truth,

47:23.540 --> 47:27.180
it's a brand elite intellectuals
like to buy.

47:27.180 --> 47:28.940
Now, if we were selling
to those folks,

47:28.940 --> 47:30.820
we'd be perfectly fine,
but we weren't.

47:30.820 --> 47:34.260
We were selling to people who wanted
certainty, who wanted...

47:34.260 --> 47:38.380
..wanted continuity, they wanted
to know who their enemies were.

47:38.380 --> 47:41.220
They want to pick up the paper...and
feel comfortable.

47:43.100 --> 47:45.180
You know, like they were...

47:45.180 --> 47:47.860
..with an extraordinary old friend.

47:50.620 --> 47:51.660
What did he say?

47:53.180 --> 47:55.340
He said it sounded like propaganda.

47:59.660 --> 48:01.620
What do you think it sounds like?

48:04.620 --> 48:06.260
Sounds fine to me.

48:52.740 --> 48:57.220
This general election is the most
important in a generation.

48:57.220 --> 48:58.700
The choice is clear.

48:58.700 --> 49:01.300
Hope or fear?

49:01.300 --> 49:05.660
The opposition party have been
spreading a message of fear.

49:05.660 --> 49:08.700
They seek to divide
rather than include.

49:17.980 --> 49:19.540
Choose hope.

49:44.260 --> 49:46.100
You trusted me...

49:47.580 --> 49:51.540
..to make this a better country.

49:53.820 --> 49:57.900
And it is better, and fairer,

49:57.900 --> 49:59.500
but it's not enough.

50:00.820 --> 50:03.180
It's nowhere near enough.

50:05.220 --> 50:06.860
You want more.

50:08.460 --> 50:11.540
I want more for you.

50:11.540 --> 50:13.420
For all of you.

50:13.420 --> 50:17.420
The people who vote for me
and the people who don't.

50:18.860 --> 50:21.820
We have achieved so much together.

50:24.460 --> 50:28.460
And I still have so much more
work to do.

50:35.740 --> 50:42.180
I will not trade favours
for favourable coverage.

50:42.180 --> 50:45.700
I will not win at any cost.

50:45.700 --> 50:49.500
This country is not for sale.

50:49.500 --> 50:54.740
Our democracy is not for sale.

51:11.620 --> 51:13.820
I'm going to win, Max.

51:13.820 --> 51:18.020
And when I do, I'm going to break
your empire into little pieces.

51:18.020 --> 51:21.860
Not because I'm angry...
No? You sound angry.

51:21.860 --> 51:25.180
..but because she's dangerous.
And you know that, don't you?

51:25.180 --> 51:28.660
Have you ever considered the fact
that you might be out of touch?

51:28.660 --> 51:32.620
That my headlines only have power
when they're true?

51:32.620 --> 51:36.820
That you don't understand the pain
of the people any more?

51:36.820 --> 51:40.900
And while you continue to rip up
your country's favourite newspaper

51:40.900 --> 51:43.580
because your pride is hurt,
their hurt is real.

51:43.580 --> 51:45.820
I don't know what
she's promised you.

51:45.820 --> 51:49.060
But when you lose... I can't lose.
I'm not running.

51:49.060 --> 51:51.260
..and you will lose,

51:51.260 --> 51:53.700
the myth of your influence will die.

51:53.700 --> 51:56.940
Your greatest trick was always
picking the winning side, Max,

51:56.940 --> 51:59.580
and making them believe
that you won it for them.

51:59.580 --> 52:01.380
You're right, you're right.

52:01.380 --> 52:04.780
My readers decide.
I only pick the winner.

52:04.780 --> 52:06.660
And this time, it's not you.

52:26.060 --> 52:27.380
Hi.

52:27.380 --> 52:28.660
Hello.

52:30.140 --> 52:33.820
We were at some of the same parties
once upon a time.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.260
I remember.

52:35.260 --> 52:37.300
I know your work very well.
I'm a great admirer.

52:37.300 --> 52:38.860
That's kind.

52:38.860 --> 52:41.740
They said you've got an interview
arranged with Caden

52:41.740 --> 52:43.660
about recovering from a stroke?

52:43.660 --> 52:47.620
It's called blagging,
and I'm ashamed to admit it.

52:47.620 --> 52:49.660
But the cause is a good one.

52:49.660 --> 52:51.860
And what is that?

52:51.860 --> 52:54.660
Has Caden ever spoken to you
about his work?

52:54.660 --> 52:56.860
You'll have to be less vague.

52:56.860 --> 53:01.220
Well, people say all kinds of things
after a stroke.

53:06.580 --> 53:08.260
What have you heard?

53:08.260 --> 53:10.460
I've spoken to people.

53:10.460 --> 53:13.420
Staff at Caden's first hospital.

53:13.420 --> 53:18.660
A nurse who claims he said,
"I did your phone."

53:18.660 --> 53:21.220
Do you have any idea
what that means?

53:22.820 --> 53:24.140
It's a strange phrase.

53:28.660 --> 53:31.620
If you ever want
to arrange an interview...

53:32.980 --> 53:35.060
..about recovering from a stroke...

53:55.260 --> 53:57.180
Yeah. Max?

53:58.220 --> 54:01.020
We need to talk.
It's not a good time.

54:01.020 --> 54:03.140
The three of us.

54:03.140 --> 54:04.340
He's told me everything.

54:06.140 --> 54:08.060
All right. I'm on my way.

54:08.060 --> 54:09.460
Text me the address.

54:13.020 --> 54:15.020
Keys in the car? They are.

54:16.460 --> 54:18.860
It's all right.
I'm going to take it.

54:18.860 --> 54:20.220
OK, thank you.

54:31.860 --> 54:33.020
I'll have him back tonight.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.700
Family matter.

54:47.340 --> 54:49.020
How was Dad on the phone?

54:51.100 --> 54:52.340
Quiet.

54:54.260 --> 54:55.780
Quiet?

54:59.100 --> 55:02.780
You don't know him, Mum.

55:02.780 --> 55:03.860
I don't know him?

55:05.140 --> 55:08.340
I lived with your father
for 14 years.

55:08.340 --> 55:10.100
Yeah.

55:10.100 --> 55:12.180
But you don't know him.

55:13.660 --> 55:15.460
Not like this.

55:19.340 --> 55:21.180
Not the man who's about to arrive.
