00:17.600 --> 00:22.021
THE OTHERS

01:02.062 --> 01:03.313
Mrs. Evelina!

01:04.481 --> 01:07.150
-Where's Martha?
-Sorry, I couldn't do anything.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.234
Where's Martha?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.236
We were in the restroom,
and they took her.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.780
What do you mean? Who?

01:11.863 --> 01:12.864
The drug dealers.

01:36.721 --> 01:41.184
<i>I feel the warmth</i>
<i>from my boiling blood</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:45.396
<i>I feel the fear,</i>
<i>sweat dripping away</i>

01:45.522 --> 01:49.484
<i>There's a stillness</i>
<i>that nothing transmits</i>

01:50.151 --> 01:56.324
<i>I'm a breeze that grows stronger</i>

01:56.533 --> 01:59.661
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:04.415
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:05.166 --> 02:08.711
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:09.712 --> 02:13.842
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:18.388 --> 02:22.308
<i>I have the dust that protects the road</i>

02:22.559 --> 02:26.688
<i>I have the branches of a leafless tree</i>

02:27.397 --> 02:31.359
<i>I'm the guardian of the tired night</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:37.615
<i>There are silhouettes that</i>
<i>come to meet me</i>

02:38.241 --> 02:42.495
<i>Even when the clouds drift away</i>

02:42.579 --> 02:45.540
<i>Even when my skin dries away</i>

02:46.583 --> 02:50.253
<i>I'll be back someday</i>

02:51.379 --> 02:55.258
<i>To unleash my return</i>

02:56.676 --> 03:00.179
WHERE ARE THEY?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.662
Hey, would you like to make some cash?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.085
What needs to be done?

03:31.794 --> 03:32.629
Come closer.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.387
Run!

04:32.897 --> 04:34.482
Did you think you'd get away?

04:34.565 --> 04:37.443
Please, tell me what I can do?
I'll do any job.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.445
I don't care.
We need people for the war.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.574
STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

04:43.658 --> 04:45.451
When will we have the bodies?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.036
My son isn't on any list.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.497
Neither is my daughter,
she was taken.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.915
Silence, please.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.001
-Please...
-We've been waiting for hours.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.463
Either you shut up, or you leave.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.802
It appears that this was an attack
from Sinaloa's Cartel on Gulf's Cartel.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.680
Are our children responsible?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.307
Tell us who killed them.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.642
Well, that's the information
we have so far.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.311
We'll keep you informed.

05:13.521 --> 05:14.355
Hey...

05:14.981 --> 05:16.441
My daughter isn't dead.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.527
-Please, sir.
-You must find her, please.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.571
She's just a girl.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.907
Please, you must find her, please!

05:26.367 --> 05:27.744
Please help me.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.579
Her name is Martha, they took her.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.625
If the Sinaloa cartel took her,
you'd better forget about her.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.336
Why? Where do they take them?

05:38.463 --> 05:40.465
Girls like your daughter are taken

05:40.590 --> 05:41.966
to Culiacan.

05:59.734 --> 06:03.362
GOLDEN TRIANGLE
NORTHEAST MEXICO

06:10.953 --> 06:12.914
I'm going to get water. Do you want some?

06:28.638 --> 06:29.847
Can I get some water?

06:30.681 --> 06:32.558
You only have two minutes.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.020
Zenaida!

07:18.479 --> 07:19.856
Juan.

07:42.378 --> 07:45.006
EMES SAFE HOUSE

08:23.503 --> 08:24.837
Don't be stupid, it's water.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.890
Be silent, you'll be fine.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.370
I can put you in prison
because you grow this shit.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.832
Who's the field manager?

09:07.505 --> 09:08.839
I don't like to ask twice.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.008
Who is it?

09:12.510 --> 09:13.344
It's me.

09:15.680 --> 09:16.514
Get up.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.729
We only follow orders, man.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.398
We work for the boss.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.526
-We work for Chente.
-You worked for Chente.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.237
Now you work for Sinaloa.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.365
Is that understood?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.201
If you do your job,

09:38.286 --> 09:39.912
you won't even notice the change.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.125
See that they do it.

09:44.959 --> 09:45.793
Yes, boss.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.338
Come on, guys. Back to work.

10:03.060 --> 10:05.438
Yes, we'll be available.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.481
Thanks a lot.

10:19.160 --> 10:20.077
What are you doing?

10:20.828 --> 10:22.580
I'm taking another outfit.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.750
She was wearing heels.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.170
They told us to stay here,
until they had more information.

10:34.717 --> 10:35.968
Nobody's looking for her.

10:39.972 --> 10:41.599
You're going to Culiacan,

10:42.224 --> 10:43.684
they'll kill you, too.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.191
Me too?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.112
Do you think she's dead?

11:02.286 --> 11:05.039
I'll tell my friend to drive
the taxi for a few days,

11:05.122 --> 11:06.123
so I can go with you.

11:09.502 --> 11:10.753
You stay here in case she calls.

11:12.880 --> 11:14.340
I'm going to Culiacan to look for her.

11:36.278 --> 11:38.948
If you do what I say, you'll be fine.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.119
The guys outside are ruthless.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.329
They won't think twice about killing you,

11:45.996 --> 11:46.872
so do as they say.

11:47.331 --> 11:50.084
So you can walk back home,
and not in a plastic bag.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.712
-Do you work here?
-I have no other choice.

11:55.631 --> 11:56.465
Here they come.

11:56.924 --> 11:59.218
Get ready, you'll do things
you've never done.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.678
What things?

12:01.137 --> 12:02.054
Get up, get up!

12:09.603 --> 12:12.148
You work for us now,
and your boss is Cano.

12:15.067 --> 12:16.152
Nobody can drop out.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.863
If you're useless, you're eliminated.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.543
Have you ever grabbed a gun?

12:34.879 --> 12:36.338
Let's see what you're made of.

13:18.130 --> 13:18.964
Sorry...

13:20.257 --> 13:21.091
Your t-shirt.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.763
-Is that your son?
-Yes, have you seen him?

13:26.847 --> 13:27.806
No, I'm sorry.

13:32.603 --> 13:33.938
This is my daughter.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.489
They said I could find her in Culiacan.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.116
You're lucky.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.827
At least you know where to look.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.126
My boy was in the fields.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.420
He was taken several months ago.

14:01.465 --> 14:03.133
I'm sorry for what I'm about to say,

14:04.385 --> 14:06.554
but if I were you,
I would search in the bars.

14:07.263 --> 14:08.722
They put them to work there.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.330
This son of a bitch is Chapo's man.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.084
He has killed our people,
entered our turf,

14:37.209 --> 14:38.794
he has tried to buy our people.

14:39.503 --> 14:40.713
Does he deserve to live?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.177
Answer, does he deserve to live?

14:52.600 --> 14:53.434
Gun...

14:57.938 --> 14:58.981
He's the enemy.

14:59.523 --> 15:00.691
Not us.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.320
We must exterminate them
so we can live in peace.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.909
You only have to pull the trigger.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.250
Fire.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.597
I'll help you. It's either him or you.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.277
Fire.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.447
Fire!

15:52.993 --> 15:54.578
Last chance, five...

15:55.162 --> 15:57.164
four, three...

15:58.207 --> 15:59.124
two...

16:00.084 --> 16:00.918
one.

16:19.019 --> 16:20.062
You'll die.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.400
But first we'll make you suffer
so much, you'll beg to die.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.476
I thought Juarez was the worst cartel.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.645
But these guys make me miss them.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.358
We must hold on, until the end of harvest.

17:51.445 --> 17:53.906
When this one's out,
they'll look for another field.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.657
That can take months.

17:55.783 --> 17:56.909
We don't have options.

18:00.287 --> 18:01.747
I don't know if I can take it.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.625
I prefer jail to continuing on like this.

18:14.093 --> 18:14.927
How much is it?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.096
180 pesos.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.576
Good afternoon.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.746
They told us you're
looking for your daughter.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.834
Yes, sir.

19:29.793 --> 19:30.752
That's her.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.463
They took her from Nuevo Laredo.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.634
Do you recognize her?

19:38.468 --> 19:39.344
Have you seen her?

19:41.471 --> 19:42.306
Yes, ma'am.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.226
A local drug lord
shows her around like a doll.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.478
You don't understand.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.022
Don't worry, ma'am.

19:50.105 --> 19:51.106
At least she's alive.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.609
This drug lord knows how to negotiate.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.860
How can I negotiate?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.530
He'll ask for a lot of money
to let her go.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.658
How much?

20:02.117 --> 20:03.785
70 thousand, at least.

20:06.455 --> 20:07.873
I don't have that money.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.041
Listen, ma'am.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.919
We can help you.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.880
But you need to get that money.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.758
Otherwise the drug lord
won't be interested.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.843
She could have more problems.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.013
I have to talk to my husband.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.057
Wait for me, please.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.558
Don't go.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.273
<i>-Hello?</i>
-It's me.

20:33.398 --> 20:35.359
<i>Evelina, I was worried.</i>

20:35.692 --> 20:37.736
A couple of police men recognized Martha.

20:37.819 --> 20:38.946
They know where she is.

20:39.279 --> 20:40.656
They'll go and get her.

20:41.615 --> 20:44.159
But we must pay the drug lord
to release her.

20:45.035 --> 20:45.869
<i>How much?</i>

20:47.120 --> 20:48.288
We must sell the taxi.

20:48.747 --> 20:50.874
<i>I can sell it to Alfredo.</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:53.502
<i>But, if they know where she is</i>

20:53.585 --> 20:54.920
<i>why don't they ask for help?</i>

20:55.003 --> 20:56.213
Because they'll kill her.

20:57.005 --> 20:58.882
It can't be done with force.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.509
They must negotiate.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.552
<i>-What if it isn't true?</i>
-What if it is?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.221
I won't take that risk.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.056
Send the money.

21:08.141 --> 21:10.060
I'll return with Martha, I promise.

21:20.153 --> 21:20.988
Hey.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.784
You didn't do so bad.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.538
The first time I did it,
I couldn't even lift my hand.

21:38.630 --> 21:41.633
I asked M16 to give you another chance.

21:42.384 --> 21:45.512
But no more, Omar.
You learn how to kill or they'll kill you.

21:47.389 --> 21:48.223
How do I do it?

21:53.353 --> 21:54.187
This helps.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.651
This, and thinking the person
in front of you is not like us.

22:00.444 --> 22:02.029
Have you ever killed a cockroach?

22:02.988 --> 22:06.366
It's the same. If there's a cockroach,
you don't hesitate,

22:06.450 --> 22:08.327
you just kill it, and that's it.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.082
Can I go and get some water?

22:16.960 --> 22:18.712
We've been working for many hours.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.051
Help! Help!

22:24.134 --> 22:24.968
What happened?

22:26.470 --> 22:27.304
What happened?

22:27.971 --> 22:30.557
Homero? Homero?

22:31.141 --> 22:33.143
Pedro, get some water!

22:33.518 --> 22:35.562
Homero? Hurry up!

22:36.772 --> 22:38.315
Give him some water.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.609
Stop that, get back to work!

22:40.692 --> 22:43.487
-Wait for a moment, please.
-Move!

22:53.163 --> 22:54.498
-What happened?
<i>-I sold it.</i>

22:54.581 --> 22:57.167
<i>But with the rush,</i>
<i>I could only get 35 thousand.</i>

22:57.292 --> 23:00.337
That's so little. They said 70 thousand,
at least.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.132
I can pawn the TV and everything I can.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.093
I think I can gather 50 thousand.

23:06.301 --> 23:08.428
I can do the deposit in about two hours.

23:08.929 --> 23:13.058
<i>Don't give them the money</i>
<i>until you're certain it's Martha.</i>

23:13.350 --> 23:15.143
Yes, I'll ask for proof.

23:15.644 --> 23:17.479
But hurry up, Manuel.

23:24.277 --> 23:25.612
I wanted to be a lieutenant.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.449
I was on the right path.
I was the colonel's driver

23:30.117 --> 23:31.785
He had a very hot girlfriend.

23:32.410 --> 23:35.539
She also liked me,
we grew fond of each other.

23:36.873 --> 23:37.707
Until, one day...

23:39.417 --> 23:40.252
he caught us.

23:41.336 --> 23:44.256
That was it, I had to run away naked,

23:44.339 --> 23:46.800
while the colonel shot,
I ran like a baby deer,

23:46.883 --> 23:48.093
dodging the bullets.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.060
I wanted to be a soccer player.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.021
Are you good?

24:02.023 --> 24:04.776
I was about to get in third division,
with the Bravos.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.236
But they killed our coach.

24:07.154 --> 24:10.407
See? That motherfucking Sinaloa Cartel
has ruined our lives.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.326
We have to kill them
to settle things down.

24:19.457 --> 24:22.627
This helps, trust me.

24:32.012 --> 24:33.221
We have to leave.

24:34.389 --> 24:35.724
I don't get you, Juan.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.227
You just told me we should wait,
until the end of harvest.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.937
If we stay...

24:41.938 --> 24:43.148
we'll wind up dead.

24:45.192 --> 24:46.860
It's difficult to escape.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.528
They're everywhere.

24:48.778 --> 24:49.863
Through the Romero's house.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.617
We could go out from there, at night.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.871
If we get caught, we won't live to tell.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.456
We won't go if you don't want.

25:00.749 --> 25:02.083
But this is getting worse.

25:02.918 --> 25:05.712
More will come after,
we don't know what they'll be like.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.303
I'll talk with the Romero's.

26:11.027 --> 26:12.487
How much did you get?

26:12.696 --> 26:14.572
A little more than I told you.

26:15.699 --> 26:17.617
We got 60 thousand.

26:19.286 --> 26:22.122
It will be hard,
but I think he'll agree to it.

26:25.166 --> 26:26.001
Thank you.

26:27.585 --> 26:30.297
Really, thank you for all
you're doing for Martha.

26:33.925 --> 26:34.926
Do you have children?

28:09.979 --> 28:12.190
They'll be fine, trust me.

28:12.357 --> 28:15.276
<i>-He's the enemy.</i>
<i>-We must finish them.</i>

28:15.360 --> 28:17.320
<i>-He's the enemy.</i>
<i>-Run!</i>

28:17.404 --> 28:18.780
<i>You can't escape.</i>

28:18.863 --> 28:20.740
<i>-Trust me.</i>
<i>-Shoot!</i>

28:20.824 --> 28:22.700
<i>-Trust me.</i>
<i>-Shoot!</i>

28:22.784 --> 28:23.910
<i>Last chance.</i>

29:47.452 --> 29:48.536
Who's there?

29:54.501 --> 29:55.794
Who's there?

30:02.133 --> 30:04.636
Juan, take them.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.223
Here, take them, take care of them.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.560
It's me, boss.

30:14.270 --> 30:15.855
It's me, I'm sorry.

30:16.773 --> 30:17.982
You wanted to leave, fucker?

30:19.526 --> 30:22.403
The leader called me here yesterday...

31:04.737 --> 31:07.156
-Is this it?
-Yes.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.660
Give me the money,
and we'll talk with the drug lord.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.372
Can I go with you?

31:15.039 --> 31:16.666
What if it's not my daughter?

31:17.834 --> 31:19.419
That's not how things work.

31:19.794 --> 31:21.713
You give us the cash or there's no deal.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.015
Are you ready?

31:43.902 --> 31:46.946
Over there! Shoot them!
Don't let them escape!

31:50.700 --> 31:52.368
Mommy, mommy!

31:54.370 --> 31:57.248
I need proof that it's my daughter.

31:57.916 --> 32:00.668
I recognized her.
What other proof do you need?

32:01.544 --> 32:05.006
The drug lord loves to say
she's like a souvenir from Laredo.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.717
We're risking ourselves, too, here.

32:07.884 --> 32:11.638
If you don't give us the money,
we go back and you never see her again.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.252
Don't make me look bad,
or we both get killed.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.840
There they go! Don't let them go!

32:50.802 --> 32:51.636
Mommy, mommy!

32:51.761 --> 32:54.055
Hey kid, wait, kid!

32:54.180 --> 32:55.431
Juan, go get him!

32:59.560 --> 33:00.520
No! They killed him!

33:00.603 --> 33:01.437
They'll hear you.

33:07.694 --> 33:08.653
No!

33:09.112 --> 33:10.279
No, wait...

33:31.968 --> 33:34.429
Juan! Where are you going?
Come back... Juan!

33:45.148 --> 33:48.359
You're alive! You're OK!

33:56.576 --> 33:59.495
-You saw her?
-I already told you I did.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.086
What color was her hair?

34:10.089 --> 34:11.466
Brown, like the photo.

34:17.055 --> 34:17.889
Well, that's it.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.268
Ma'am we don't have all night.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.659
You know what to do.

34:49.629 --> 34:50.797
Please don't kill me.

34:51.839 --> 34:53.299
I'll never drop out again.

34:56.219 --> 34:58.262
It's him or you.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.761
Two months ago she dyed her hair blond.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.931
I told her not to, but she dyed it anyway.

35:42.557 --> 35:43.391
Please!

35:57.989 --> 36:00.533
That's all I have to find my daughter.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.287
Please give me back her stuff, please!

36:04.704 --> 36:06.831
Please give me back her stuff!

36:06.914 --> 36:08.666
Give me her stuff!

36:08.749 --> 36:09.792
Go back to Nuevo Laredo.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.296
Don't even think about talking about this,
or I'll shut you up.

37:13.105 --> 37:16.525
<i>I can tell you today,</i>
<i>that we're rebuilding</i>

37:16.609 --> 37:18.611
<i>the social structure of this country,</i>

37:19.237 --> 37:21.322
<i>thanks to the advances we've had</i>

37:21.405 --> 37:23.032
<i>in the war against drugs.</i>

37:25.952 --> 37:28.663
<i>The operations implemented</i>
<i>in conflict areas</i>

37:28.788 --> 37:31.207
<i>have delivered tangible results.</i>

37:31.540 --> 37:34.752
<i>We have dismantled</i>
<i>large criminal organizations.</i>

37:35.169 --> 37:36.837
<i>And we'll continue to do so.</i>

37:45.096 --> 37:49.141
Drug cargoes have been seized
all across the country.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.143
What about the missing people?

37:55.356 --> 37:57.066
I can't welcome you here.

37:58.609 --> 38:02.321
Ever since you declared the war against
drugs, no one can live in peace.

38:04.031 --> 38:05.741
My daughter was kidnapped.

38:07.535 --> 38:09.578
So far nobody's done anything to find her.

38:10.955 --> 38:14.333
We have more dead and missing people
every day!

38:14.917 --> 38:16.836
And you come to talk about achievements?

38:17.336 --> 38:18.170
I understand.

38:18.754 --> 38:21.632
The other night, 50 kids died.

38:22.341 --> 38:24.427
You said all of them were gang members.

38:24.510 --> 38:25.928
Drug dealers.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.390
They were students!

38:30.474 --> 38:32.518
My daughter was also a student.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.396
She worked and studied.

38:38.149 --> 38:39.775
She was a good girl.

38:45.906 --> 38:48.576
You owe all of the parents an apology.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.661
And all of the residents, too.

38:51.287 --> 38:53.914
Because we have to put up with your war.

38:54.040 --> 38:54.874
Of course.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.252
If one of your children
had been kidnapped,

38:58.336 --> 39:00.671
you would have done
the impossible to find them.

39:03.090 --> 39:05.092
If one of your children had been murdered,

39:05.176 --> 39:09.013
you would look for those responsible,
even at your own risk.

39:10.306 --> 39:11.140
Of course.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.142
Don't "of course" me!

39:13.559 --> 39:15.019
Do something!

39:15.644 --> 39:17.813
Stop your war already!

39:28.991 --> 39:32.078
BUS STATION
MEXICO CITY

40:16.163 --> 40:17.331
Thank you.

40:26.257 --> 40:29.093
HAVE YOU SEEN HER?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.449
Hey, man, cheers.

41:33.532 --> 41:34.366
Buddy.

41:39.371 --> 41:40.998
Look at Moreno.

41:47.796 --> 41:49.381
That's my boy!

41:54.303 --> 41:55.804
That's my fucking son.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.990
I'll be right back.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.744
You have a lot of nerve to call me today.

42:18.911 --> 42:21.539
-You know I'm at my wedding.
<i>-I'm not congratulating you.</i>

42:21.705 --> 42:24.542
The President is worried about
the Cano and Chente situation.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.461
The public is questioning him.

42:27.670 --> 42:28.796
<i>The media is after him.</i>

42:28.963 --> 42:29.838
He can suck it up.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.341
Nobody said this would be easy.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.343
He's getting impatient, Joaquín.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.387
If you don't finish this war,

42:36.720 --> 42:38.138
the agreement will end.

42:41.934 --> 42:42.977
<i>What should I tell him?</i>

42:44.770 --> 42:46.438
If war is not working,

42:46.605 --> 42:48.315
we have to try peace.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.090
