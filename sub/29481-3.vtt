- No, who's that?

40:10.495 --> 40:12.671
- He played short stop
for the Brooklyn Cyclones

40:12.714 --> 40:14.150
when I was a kid.

40:14.194 --> 40:16.283
It's a New York Mets
minor league team,

40:16.326 --> 40:18.111
and I was his biggest fan.

40:18.154 --> 40:20.461
And one night
I see him leaving his game,

40:20.505 --> 40:22.724
and I work up all
of my courage,

40:22.768 --> 40:24.465
and tell him what
he means to me,

40:24.509 --> 40:27.294
and tell him how
I want to be just like him.

40:27.337 --> 40:31.516
And he looks me in the eye,

40:31.559 --> 40:33.692
and said, "That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard."

40:33.735 --> 40:35.737
- [laughs]

40:35.781 --> 40:37.826
- And just walked away.

40:41.264 --> 40:43.615
- Well, it's what they say,
you know?

40:43.658 --> 40:45.486
Never meet your heroes.
