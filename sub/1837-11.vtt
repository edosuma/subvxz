00:07.500 --> 00:08.900
Oh, hey, Rae,
how's that cold coming?

00:08.900 --> 00:10.300
Yeah, I'm feeling much better.

00:10.300 --> 00:11.300
Oh, good.
Thanks.

00:11.300 --> 00:12.700
(<i>blows nose loudly </i>)

00:13.600 --> 00:15.567
Ew.

00:15.567 --> 00:17.600
Well, uh,
at least you<i>look </i>good.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.100
(<i>thinking </i>):
<i>Man that hair is tore up.</i>

00:20.100 --> 00:23.500
What'd you just say
about my hair?

00:23.500 --> 00:25.100
Uh, nothing.

00:25.100 --> 00:27.467
<i>Did I say that out loud?</i>

00:27.467 --> 00:28.967
No...

00:28.967 --> 00:30.934
but I... I think I heard it,

00:30.934 --> 00:32.700
like, inside my head
or something.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.233
What? Wha...?

00:34.233 --> 00:36.967
Rae, did you just
read his mind?

00:36.967 --> 00:38.600
I-I-I don't know.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.367
Something weird's going on.

00:40.367 --> 00:41.600
Oh, Rae, Rae, do me, do me.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.500
Read my mind.
Okay.

00:43.500 --> 00:46.367
(<i>crickets chirping </i>)

00:48.033 --> 00:51.033
Yeah, yeah, I'm not really
getting anything, really.

00:51.033 --> 00:52.200
Sorry.

00:52.200 --> 00:54.867
Wow. You are amazing.
Just amazing.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.800
You know what, I don't
know what's going on.

00:56.800 --> 00:58.600
I just got to go home
and get to bed.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.934
You know what?

01:01.934 --> 01:04.600

<i>Denzel is</i>

02:09.200 --> 02:11.834
<i>looking fine. Mm!</i>

02:11.834 --> 02:14.600
Mom, please stop
what you're thinking.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.767
Honey, I'm just reading
my horoscope.

02:17.767 --> 02:19.467
And Denzel is not
in your future.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.600
Huh?

02:20.600 --> 02:23.300
Okay, you're scaring me.
What's going on?

02:23.300 --> 02:25.300
Uh, nothing, it's this cold--
I think there are

02:25.300 --> 02:26.900
some weird side effects
or something.

02:26.900 --> 02:28.467
VICTOR:
Hey, guess what?

02:28.467 --> 02:30.300
My mother's coming
to stay with us this weekend.

02:30.300 --> 02:31.400
Nana's coming?
Mm-hmm.

02:31.400 --> 02:32.734
Oh, honey,
that's wonderful.

02:32.734 --> 02:35.467
<i>Just what I need--</i>
<i>an unexpected visit</i>

02:35.467 --> 02:37.567
<i>from that stuffy old busybody.</i>

02:37.567 --> 02:39.600
(<i>coughing </i>)

02:39.600 --> 02:41.000
Hey, Rae,
is that cold

02:41.000 --> 02:42.300
still bothering you?

02:42.300 --> 02:44.367
Not as much as some other stuff.

02:44.367 --> 02:47.100
So, Tonya, you okay with
my mother staying with us?

02:47.100 --> 02:50.967
<i>She always says fine,</i>
<i>but she never means it.</i>

02:50.967 --> 02:52.834
Fine.

02:53.934 --> 02:57.300
<i>I always say that,</i>
<i>but I never mean it.</i>

02:57.300 --> 02:58.400
VICTOR:
Oh, and, Rae,

02:58.400 --> 03:00.066
remember, when
Nana gets here,

03:00.066 --> 03:01.567
no talk about
being psychic.

03:01.567 --> 03:03.300
TONYA:
Honey, you know,
maybe it's time

03:03.300 --> 03:05.500
that we told your mom
that Raven is psychic.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.233
No way. You remember
how she reacted

03:07.233 --> 03:09.500
when we told her<i>your</i>
mother was psychic.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.667
It's true,
she did have some issues.

03:12.667 --> 03:16.600
<i>She thought my mom was</i>
<i>some kind of freaky... whoo!</i>

03:17.600 --> 03:20.033
Look, look,
I hardly ever see Nana,

03:20.033 --> 03:21.500
and I love her so much.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.100
I wouldn't want to do anything
to hurt her.

03:24.100 --> 03:26.400
<i>At least somebody cares</i>
<i>about my mother.</i>

03:26.400 --> 03:28.800
<i>At least somebody cares</i>
<i>about his mother.</i>

03:30.667 --> 03:33.000
<i>I can't let them know</i>
<i>I'm reading their minds.</i>

03:33.000 --> 03:35.500
<i>They'll think</i>
<i>I'm spying on them.</i>

03:35.500 --> 03:39.567
<i>Oh, snap!</i>
<i>I just read my own mind.</i>

03:39.567 --> 03:41.734
(<i>laughing to herself </i>):
<i>Oh. Wait.</i>

03:41.734 --> 03:43.500
<i>Everybody can do that.</i>

03:43.500 --> 03:46.100
(<i>laughing to herself </i>)

03:46.100 --> 03:48.400
You okay, baby?

03:48.400 --> 03:52.400
Mom... Dad...

03:52.400 --> 03:55.200
I-I don't know how, but...

03:55.200 --> 03:57.233
I can read your minds.

03:57.233 --> 03:59.767
Oh, honey...

03:59.767 --> 04:02.300
watery eyes, runny nose,
reading minds--

04:02.300 --> 04:04.100
you have a psychic cold.

04:04.100 --> 04:05.500
My mother used to get them
all the time.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.567
It only lasts a few days.

04:06.567 --> 04:07.834
You're going to be fine.

04:07.834 --> 04:09.100
Yeah, yeah, fine.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.600
So, what'd you
hear us thinking?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.500
I heard enough.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.300
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)
Okay, Mother's here.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.100
Just be yourselves.

04:21.100 --> 04:23.233
Dad, if I was going
to be myself,

04:23.233 --> 04:26.700
I'd be upstairs playing
video games in my underwear.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
Just behave.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.900
(<i>sighs and clears throat </i>)

04:31.834 --> 04:32.934
Mother.

04:32.934 --> 04:35.500
My baby!

04:35.500 --> 04:38.400
And my grandbabies.

04:38.400 --> 04:39.500
Nana!
Nana!

04:39.500 --> 04:41.834
(<i>laughing </i>)

04:41.834 --> 04:43.400
And Tonya.

04:47.867 --> 04:49.300
Raven!

04:49.300 --> 04:51.700
How are you feeling, sweetheart?

04:51.700 --> 04:52.767
I hear
you have a cold.

04:52.767 --> 04:54.100
NANA (<i>thinking </i>):
<i>No wonder--</i>

04:54.100 --> 04:56.800
<i>Tonya does keep a drafty house.</i>

04:58.000 --> 05:00.200
Actually, Nana,
I'm feeling much better.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.867
My mom just keeps it so warm

05:01.867 --> 05:03.600
and toasty in the house.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.000
(<i>laughing </i>):
Oh...

05:05.000 --> 05:06.667
Well, Cory,

05:06.667 --> 05:09.400
this is for you,
sweetheart.

05:10.367 --> 05:12.467
It's a fishing rod.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.200
Your grandfather
loved to fish.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.467
Man, this thing is
off the heezie!

05:18.467 --> 05:20.567
VICTOR:
Cory.

05:20.567 --> 05:22.734
I mean,

05:22.734 --> 05:25.000
thank you ever so much.

05:26.500 --> 05:30.233
And I have a<i>very </i>special
surprise for you, Raven.

05:30.233 --> 05:32.133
Oh, Nana, you didn't have
to get me anything.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.200
I didn't.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.300
CORY (<i>thinking </i>):
<i>♪ Raven got nothing,</i>
<i>Nana likes me better. ♪</i>

05:39.300 --> 05:42.734
I'm saving your surprise
for later.

05:42.734 --> 05:45.300
Ha!

05:47.200 --> 05:49.233
Nana, I've got
a surprise for you.
Oh.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.467
I'd like you to meet Lionel.

05:51.467 --> 05:54.467
Oh, Cory, I really don't
think that's a good idea.

05:54.467 --> 05:56.300
(<i>squeaking </i>)
Get it away!

05:56.300 --> 05:57.467
Get it away!

05:57.467 --> 05:58.934
M-Mother Baxter...

05:58.934 --> 06:01.100
Oh...!

06:01.100 --> 06:02.700
It's okay.

06:02.700 --> 06:04.200
Lionel is
Cory's pet rat.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.500
VICTOR:
Uh-huh.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.700
A rat that will be going
on a little vacation

06:07.700 --> 06:09.000
for the next few days.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.600
Cory, let's go, now.

06:13.367 --> 06:15.867
I don't know if Lionel's
ready for this.

06:15.867 --> 06:17.667
He's never been away from home.

06:17.667 --> 06:19.900
He's staying at my crib
for a couple of days, okay?

06:19.900 --> 06:21.200
Man up, Cory.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.233
You're right.

06:23.233 --> 06:26.600
I have to be strong...
for Lionel.

06:28.667 --> 06:32.000
You know, I can't believe
our little Lionel's going

06:32.000 --> 06:33.767
(<i>giggles </i>):
on his first sleep-over.

06:33.767 --> 06:35.867
I remember Lionel when he was,
like, this big,

06:35.867 --> 06:37.900
and, aw, his little fingers
were, like, this big,

06:37.900 --> 06:40.734
(<i>high-pitched </i>):
and those itty-bitty
little, teensy-weensy...

06:40.734 --> 06:43.000
Okay, Chelsea,
he was small, we get it.

06:45.734 --> 06:47.700
Here you go, Lionel.

06:47.700 --> 06:49.867
Hope I didn't overpack.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.734
(<i>sniffles and sighs </i>)

06:53.300 --> 06:55.500
I'm going to miss you, buddy!

06:57.233 --> 07:00.800
There is no stronger love
than a boy and his rat.

07:00.800 --> 07:03.934
Yeah, there's also
no stranger love.

07:04.767 --> 07:06.867
TONYA:
<i>Raven...</i>

07:06.867 --> 07:08.667
I need to talk to you.

07:08.667 --> 07:12.367
I know, I read your mind.
Right.

07:12.367 --> 07:16.300
So, um, you probably
heard me thinking some
things about your Nana.

07:16.300 --> 07:18.133
You know, I just
want you to know

07:18.133 --> 07:20.934
that your Nana is
a wonderful person
who loves you a lot.

07:20.934 --> 07:22.200
Just sometimes

07:22.200 --> 07:26.033
she can be a real...
Mother Baxter!

07:26.033 --> 07:28.033
Tonya.

07:28.033 --> 07:32.800
May I borrow my darling
granddaughter for a moment,

07:32.800 --> 07:34.500
<i>s'il vous plaît?</i>

07:34.500 --> 07:36.600
<i>Just say "please"</i>
<i>like everybody else.</i>

07:37.600 --> 07:39.567
<i>Raven, did you hear that?</i>

07:39.567 --> 07:41.567
(<i>high-pitched </i>):
Uh-huh.

07:43.500 --> 07:46.400
It's time for your surprise!

07:46.400 --> 07:47.967
Oh, a tea party!

07:47.967 --> 07:50.467
Just like we used to do
when I was little! Aah!

07:50.467 --> 07:52.934
Well, now you're
a young lady,

07:52.934 --> 07:54.767
and we're not playing.

07:54.767 --> 07:59.100
I nominated you
for membership in
my social club--

07:59.100 --> 08:01.300
the White Glove Society.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.200
Oh, yeah, that<i>is </i>a surprise.

08:03.200 --> 08:06.033
Man, I wasn't expecting
to get signed up for that

08:06.033 --> 08:07.700
for about 50 or 60 years.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.100
Well, this is for
the junior chapter.

08:11.100 --> 08:14.033
The admissions committee
is coming for tea tomorrow,

08:14.033 --> 08:16.300
and we need to practice
our etiquette.

08:16.300 --> 08:19.200
Right. Nana, do you really think

08:19.200 --> 08:21.834
that I'm really, uh,
White Glove material?

08:21.834 --> 08:24.133
Of course you are.

08:24.133 --> 08:25.767
You're a Baxter.

08:25.767 --> 08:29.133
And don't worry,
tomorrow is just
a formality.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.200
You're as good as in.

08:34.300 --> 08:36.200
(<i>all screaming </i>)

08:40.667 --> 08:42.500
Raven,

08:42.500 --> 08:44.400
it's very poor etiquette
to stare blankly

08:44.400 --> 08:47.934
into space with
your mouth full.

08:47.934 --> 08:50.500
I'm-I'm sorry, Nana,
it must be the cold.

08:50.500 --> 08:52.867
Um... maybe tomorrow's not

08:52.867 --> 08:54.967
such a good time
for the committee to come over.

08:54.967 --> 08:56.400
Oh, nonsense.

08:56.400 --> 08:59.500
I've gone to a lot of trouble
to arrange this tea.

08:59.500 --> 09:03.000
It's going to be
a lovely afternoon.

09:04.734 --> 09:06.300
Oh, yeah.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.800
It's gonna be a scream.

09:18.900 --> 09:21.033
<i>Why aren't you getting ready</i>
<i>for the tea party?</i>

09:21.033 --> 09:22.900
Mom, just because I read
your mind

09:22.900 --> 09:24.934
doesn't mean
you should stop talking.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.600
I know, but it's kind of fun.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.867
Rae, what are you
doing in bed?

09:29.867 --> 09:31.834
Dad, can you please
just tell Nana

09:31.834 --> 09:33.033
that my cold came back

09:33.033 --> 09:34.500
'cause I don't want
to go to this tea party?

09:34.500 --> 09:36.000
What? Why not?

09:36.000 --> 09:39.300
Because, Dad, I had a vision
that it's going to get ugly.

09:39.300 --> 09:40.900
People were screaming
and running around

09:40.900 --> 09:42.967
and it's not because
they didn't like their tea.

09:42.967 --> 09:45.500
Okay, Victor,
maybe now is the time

09:45.500 --> 09:48.600
for us to just tell your mom
that Raven is psychic.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.000
Yeah, Dad. If we tell her now,

09:50.000 --> 09:51.600
we can avoid
this whole disaster.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.367
Yeah, maybe you're right.

09:53.367 --> 09:57.367
So, what are we
all talking about?

09:57.367 --> 10:01.500
Um, Mom, the truth is...

10:02.767 --> 10:04.400
your guests are coming
any minute

10:04.400 --> 10:07.133
and I need to put
some sugar on those
lemon bars.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.834
<i>Sorry, Rae,</i>
<i>it's not the right time.</i>

10:13.200 --> 10:14.667
Raven, a lady

10:14.667 --> 10:17.000
never stays in bed past 10:00.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.900
Sorry, Nana,
but I think my cold came back.

10:20.900 --> 10:24.600
Well, if you're really
that ill,

10:24.600 --> 10:27.700
maybe you should skip
the tea party.

10:27.700 --> 10:31.700
<i>I'll never let her know</i>
<i>how she broke my heart.</i>

10:31.700 --> 10:33.667
Nana...

10:34.600 --> 10:36.500
I-I think I'm feeling better.

10:36.500 --> 10:38.567
That's wonderful.

10:38.567 --> 10:40.000
It was probably
just a case

10:40.000 --> 10:41.033
of the nerves.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.867
Yeah.
Oh, Raven,

10:42.867 --> 10:45.700
you don't know
how much this means to me.

10:45.700 --> 10:48.200
I think I do.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.700
(<i>gasps </i>)

10:56.700 --> 10:59.600
Nana, do you actually think
this is a good ensemble?

10:59.600 --> 11:01.867
I mean, I don't feel comfortable
in this.

11:01.867 --> 11:03.000
It's just not right.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.900
Nonsense. You look divine!

11:06.900 --> 11:09.100
Oh, the committee

11:09.100 --> 11:11.600
is going to love you.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.467
Okay.

11:13.467 --> 11:14.600
(<i>doorbell rings </i>)

11:14.600 --> 11:15.800
All right.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.867
Welcome, ladies.

11:20.867 --> 11:22.467
I'd like you
to meet

11:22.467 --> 11:24.967
my darling
granddaughter Raven.

11:24.967 --> 11:27.000
Hey, what's up?
How y'all...?

11:29.000 --> 11:32.233
Um, I-I mean, charmed.

11:32.233 --> 11:36.367
Why don't we
take our seats
and have some tea?

11:36.367 --> 11:37.967
Oh, the table is lovely...

11:43.734 --> 11:45.600
Loretta?
Yes?

11:45.600 --> 11:46.867
Please lead us

11:46.867 --> 11:49.233
in the White Glove Society oath.

11:49.233 --> 11:50.600
Certainly.

11:50.600 --> 11:55.367
ALL:
I promise to always practice
good manners,

11:55.367 --> 11:56.834
good grooming,

11:56.834 --> 12:00.300
and to uphold the standards
of the White Glove Society.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.500
Yeah!

12:06.200 --> 12:07.400
You know, Raven,

12:07.400 --> 12:10.734
every time your grandmother
comes to town,

12:10.734 --> 12:12.767
she never fails to tell us

12:12.767 --> 12:15.133
all about your wonderful
accomplishments.

12:15.900 --> 12:17.834
<i>The old windbag.</i>

12:17.834 --> 12:19.400
<i>My grandson's a brain surgeon.</i>

12:19.400 --> 12:21.734
<i>You don't hear me bragging.</i>

12:25.867 --> 12:30.367
Okay, let's get this
party started then.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.200
(<i>sighs </i>)

12:35.233 --> 12:36.400
CHELSEA:
Cory?

12:36.400 --> 12:39.400
Cory, Cory this isn't
really working out.

12:39.400 --> 12:40.667
Really.

12:40.667 --> 12:41.800
Lionel, you're back!

12:41.800 --> 12:43.800
Hey, man,
we had to bring
him on home.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.734
There was too much
crying going on.

12:45.734 --> 12:47.300
Lionel was crying?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.100
No, brother, I was.

12:50.100 --> 12:52.400
The little rascal kept me up
all night--

12:52.400 --> 12:54.000
squeak, squeak, squeak, squeak.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.567
Change the tune or something.

12:55.567 --> 12:56.734
CHELSEA:
Yeah, it's weird.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.834
I went over this morning,

12:57.834 --> 12:59.200
you know,
to kind of cheer him up?

12:59.200 --> 13:01.133
I put on his little sweater
and his little leash

13:01.133 --> 13:02.233
to take him for a walk,

13:02.233 --> 13:03.600
but I don't know.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.767
He was so depressed.
It was kind of more like a drag.

13:07.734 --> 13:09.400
(<i>squeaking </i>)

13:09.400 --> 13:12.000
Man, I knew he was too young
to be away from home.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.100
Lionel!

13:19.367 --> 13:23.233
So, hasn't Raven set
a lovely table?

13:23.233 --> 13:24.400
Divine.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.000
<i>Raven this, Raven that.</i>

13:27.000 --> 13:30.033
<i>Why doesn't she stuff</i>
<i>a sock in it?</i>

13:30.033 --> 13:31.600
So, Raven,

13:31.600 --> 13:36.300
what are your future goals
and ambitions?

13:38.767 --> 13:40.934
Well, um,

13:40.934 --> 13:44.200
you know, I really, really love
to study fashion design.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.400
Lionel!

13:47.000 --> 13:48.667
Did she say vinyl?

13:48.667 --> 13:51.700
I hope that's not coming back.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.467
Um, yes, ladies, so do I.

13:53.467 --> 13:55.300
So I hope it doesn't come back
either,

13:55.300 --> 13:57.567
because that was just
ridiculous, didn't you think?

13:57.567 --> 13:58.934
But, like I was saying,

13:58.934 --> 14:02.133
I would definitely love
to study fashion design and...

14:02.133 --> 14:03.600
(<i>notes tinkling </i>)

14:03.600 --> 14:05.500
music.

14:05.500 --> 14:06.600
Music!

14:06.600 --> 14:08.367
Music!

14:08.367 --> 14:09.934
(<i>laughs </i>)

14:09.934 --> 14:11.934
Actually, ladies,
I wrote something

14:11.934 --> 14:13.900
for tonight's festivities.

14:13.900 --> 14:15.300
(<i>plays flourish </i>)

14:16.667 --> 14:20.900
Something for the White Glove
Society, I like to call...

14:20.900 --> 14:23.233
(<i>squeaking </i>)

14:23.233 --> 14:24.667
Oh, you know what?

14:24.667 --> 14:26.000
Forget about it 'cause
it's not exactly finished yet.

14:26.000 --> 14:28.567
Why don't you guys enjoy
the lemon bars

14:28.567 --> 14:30.734
that my father made for tonight.

14:30.734 --> 14:33.400
Oh, I am sure you guys
would love them.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.967
One calorie, fabulous.

14:34.967 --> 14:39.100
Um, yeah, enjoy
those lemon bars, ladies,

14:39.100 --> 14:43.000
because it's so soft and lemony.

14:43.000 --> 14:43.967
Got ya!

14:46.867 --> 14:48.467
Uh...

14:50.000 --> 14:51.400
I'm just checking out the floor,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.667
making sure it's sturdy
for the little hat dance.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.133
(<i>humming "Mexican Hat Dance" </i>)

14:58.000 --> 15:01.100
That was the entertainment
for tonight.

15:02.133 --> 15:04.033
I'm just going to retire
to the kitchen

15:04.033 --> 15:07.200
to check on the fudge.

15:07.200 --> 15:08.667
Raven, darling,

15:08.667 --> 15:11.100
we didn't make any fudge.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.500
Then I better
get started.

15:12.500 --> 15:14.300
Are you sure we
didn't make any?

15:14.300 --> 15:17.233
Okay, then I'm going
to make some. Thanks.

15:17.233 --> 15:19.667
Lionel, come out, boy.

15:19.667 --> 15:24.133
Hey, I think I have
what you're looking for.

15:24.133 --> 15:26.033
Get it. Here we go.
Here we go. Ready?

15:26.567 --> 15:29.567
Oh, man!

15:29.567 --> 15:30.734
He's not there!

15:30.734 --> 15:32.600
He must still be in there
with the ladies.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.100
If they see him, they're going
to run and scream

15:35.100 --> 15:36.300
just like in my vision!

15:36.300 --> 15:38.300
NANA:
I'll be back
in a moment.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.700
Just carry on, ladies.

15:39.700 --> 15:42.200
Raven, why are you acting
like this?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.767
Nana, you have
to believe me, okay?

15:43.767 --> 15:45.500
I am trying to
make a good impression.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.667
It's just that, uh,
these people right here,

15:47.667 --> 15:49.967
my friends and Cory,
they're having a crisis.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.100
Are you telling me
the truth?

15:52.100 --> 15:53.233
Because I smell a rat.

15:53.233 --> 15:55.300
Really? Which way did he go?

15:56.767 --> 15:59.033
Nana, everything
is under control, okay?

15:59.033 --> 16:00.100
Just go in there,

16:00.100 --> 16:02.133
sit down, tell the
ladies to flutter.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.367
Tell 'em to flutter.

16:03.367 --> 16:04.934
Yes, flutter. Bye-bye.

16:04.934 --> 16:05.967
I've got to get
in there

16:05.967 --> 16:07.567
and get back to the tea party,

16:07.567 --> 16:09.567
and you guys got to get Lionel
out of the living room!

16:09.567 --> 16:12.033
But you can't go
in there.

16:12.033 --> 16:13.734
What?
Good luck.

16:14.900 --> 16:15.967
What? What?

16:15.967 --> 16:17.600
Well, what are
we going to do?

16:19.867 --> 16:22.900
Okay, this vent goes down
to the living room.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.400
I drop the cheese,
Lionel finds it--

16:25.400 --> 16:27.100
he loves his cheese--

16:27.100 --> 16:31.467
we catch on to his harness,
reel him up, problem solved.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.200
That's the dumbest plan ever.

16:33.200 --> 16:36.200
It just might work.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.400
Raven, the ladies and I
have an announcement.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.500
Okay.

16:45.500 --> 16:46.500
We are very pleased

16:46.500 --> 16:49.033
to admit you as a junior member

16:49.033 --> 16:51.567
into the
White Glove Society.

16:51.567 --> 16:52.934
Oh, yay.

16:52.934 --> 16:55.000
<i>I just hope</i>
<i>she's not a blowhard</i>

16:55.000 --> 16:57.967
<i>like her grandmother.</i>

16:57.967 --> 16:59.033
Hey!

16:59.033 --> 17:00.467
Raven!

17:00.467 --> 17:02.500
I mean,

17:02.500 --> 17:05.700
hoo-ray!

17:05.700 --> 17:07.700
Hooray, everybody.
Thank you so much.

17:07.700 --> 17:10.000
Oh, and I accept.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.467
Wonderful tea party,
drive safe,

17:11.467 --> 17:12.734
buh-bye.

17:12.734 --> 17:15.400
Oh, not so fast, Raven.

17:15.400 --> 17:18.200
I still have the honor
of presenting you

17:18.200 --> 17:20.300
with your first pair
of white gloves.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.100
Oh, wow!

17:23.100 --> 17:26.200
I specifically packed
two gloves.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.200
(<i>rat squeaking </i>)

17:29.834 --> 17:30.900
You know what?

17:30.900 --> 17:33.400
They don't always travel
in pairs.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.400
Cheese?

17:34.400 --> 17:35.767
ALL:
Cheese?

17:35.767 --> 17:37.300
Um...

17:37.300 --> 17:39.600
say cheese for the camera.
Everybody come on.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.734
I just want to
take a picture

17:40.734 --> 17:41.967
to remember this
lovely moment.

17:41.967 --> 17:43.100
Please, everybody
over here.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.867
Stay over here.
Let's go.

17:44.867 --> 17:46.667
New member
of the society.

17:46.667 --> 17:49.000
Oh, fabulous.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.200
Flutter, flutter, flutter.

17:50.200 --> 17:51.233
Ladies,
stay right there.

17:51.233 --> 17:53.200
Don't move.
Let me get
the camera.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.000
Any luck?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.000
They're just not biting today.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.300
Yeah, but you know,

18:02.300 --> 18:04.233
sometimes it's just nice
to get away from it all.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.000
Ladies, don't move, okay?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.467
Everybody, just stay where
you are, seriously.

18:09.467 --> 18:10.800
Don't move.

18:14.100 --> 18:15.200
I got something!

18:15.200 --> 18:17.233
Reel it in!

18:19.200 --> 18:21.767
Uh-oh, the reel got jammed.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.367
What are you doing?

18:25.767 --> 18:28.000
A flying rat!

18:28.000 --> 18:29.500
Flee, ladies, flee!

18:29.500 --> 18:31.500
(<i>all screaming </i>)

18:39.900 --> 18:42.200
Dang, some of them ladies
can move.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.100
Hey, it's loose.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.367
Come to Papa.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.400
Ladies, no, no, wait!

18:56.400 --> 18:57.567
He's not really flying.

18:57.567 --> 19:01.400
Oh, go ahead and flee!

19:01.400 --> 19:02.800
Yeah, Tonya, you're right.

19:02.800 --> 19:05.500
I need to stand up
to my mother once
and for all.

19:05.500 --> 19:06.800
Thank you.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.767
(<i>screaming </i>)

19:17.300 --> 19:19.400
Okay, that hurt.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.100
Welcome home, buddy.

19:22.100 --> 19:23.667
Oh, Lionel.

19:25.100 --> 19:29.467
This is a disaster!

19:29.467 --> 19:32.033
Raven, why did you behave
like this?

19:32.033 --> 19:34.834
Nana, there's something
I wish I could tell you.

19:39.367 --> 19:40.400
Nana....

19:40.400 --> 19:42.800
(<i>clears throat </i>)

19:42.800 --> 19:45.033
I'm psychic.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.400
Oh, that's preposterous.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.000
No, it's posterous.

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
I mean, I had a vision
that this tea party

19:53.000 --> 19:54.900
was going to be a disaster.

19:54.900 --> 19:58.834
<i>Oh, no, another woo-oo</i>
<i>in the family.</i>

19:58.834 --> 20:00.700
Nana, I'm not a woo-oo.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.700
I'm your granddaughter.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.567
How did you know that...?

20:04.567 --> 20:07.200
Oh, yeah, I also have
this psychic cold,

20:07.200 --> 20:10.200
so I can temporarily read minds.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.700
And you kept this from me

20:12.700 --> 20:14.100
all these years?

20:14.100 --> 20:15.367
Mother, it's my fault.

20:15.367 --> 20:17.467
Raven and Tonya wanted
to tell you,

20:17.467 --> 20:18.734
but I didn't think
you'd accept it.

20:18.734 --> 20:20.300
Well, why would you
think that?

20:20.300 --> 20:22.133
Because Tonya's mother
is psychic

20:22.133 --> 20:23.667
and you didn't
accept her.

20:23.667 --> 20:25.100
That's not true.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.700
Mother.

20:26.700 --> 20:27.800
Well, maybe it's a little true.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.967
Mother.

20:28.967 --> 20:30.367
Don't push it, Victor.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.000
Tonya, I'm sorry.

20:34.000 --> 20:38.133
I really did judge your mother
without knowing her.

20:38.133 --> 20:40.367
And if she's anything
like Raven,

20:40.367 --> 20:42.967
I've made a terrible mistake.

20:44.033 --> 20:45.967
You must think I'm awful.

20:45.967 --> 20:47.667
Never, Nana, okay?

20:47.667 --> 20:49.767
We love you. Nana!

20:49.767 --> 20:51.100
Oh!

20:53.300 --> 20:55.033
We're family.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.367
Oh, Nana.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.600
Yeah, you need
to watch your back

21:00.600 --> 21:01.734
with that Ms. Penelope,

21:01.734 --> 21:03.033
because she ain't
playing with you.

21:03.033 --> 21:05.800
I always suspected that.

21:05.800 --> 21:07.767
Well, I think I'm through
with her

21:07.767 --> 21:09.400
and the White Glove Society.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.967
Although, this last meeting
was off the heezy!

21:12.967 --> 21:16.233
Oh, snap!
Break it down, Nana!

21:17.300 --> 21:19.300
(<i>all talking at once </i>)

21:25.100 --> 21:29.033
Cory, I told you
it's dangerous
to pull Lionel

21:29.033 --> 21:30.300
through that vent.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.033
I know.

21:32.033 --> 21:35.300
But, you didn't say anything
about lemon bars.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.100
Baby, baby.

21:40.600 --> 21:41.834
Want a bite?
