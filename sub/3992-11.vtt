WEBVTT

00:02.600 --> 00:03.760
- Can I have Carlo
slaughter you a hog?

00:03.800 --> 00:06.689
A token of my appreciation
for all that you do for Margot.

00:06.740 --> 00:10.232
- (Hannibal): Was Will aware of
your intention to get pregnant?
- I'm all you have.

00:10.270 --> 00:12.670
- Will understands that
Hannibal Lecter can help him.

00:12.710 --> 00:17.272
- What Will understands is
if you can't beat him, join him.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.517
_ Freddie was investigating
a story about

00:19.550 --> 00:22.383
Will and Hannibal
committing murders together.

00:22.420 --> 00:25.389
- She was a slim
and delicate pig.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.217
- You slice the ginger.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.492
(animal bellowing)

00:49.610 --> 00:52.170
(gasping)

01:04.260 --> 01:06.251
(soft classical piano music)

01:08.260 --> 01:11.195
(bird tweeting)

01:38.560 --> 01:41.825
Among gourmands, the ortolan
bunting is considered a rare

01:41.860 --> 01:45.523
but debauched delicacy.

01:45.570 --> 01:48.164
A rite of passage,
if you will.

01:50.910 --> 01:54.573
Preparation calls for the
songbird to be drowned
alive in Armagnac.

01:54.610 --> 01:56.578
It is then roasted

01:56.610 --> 01:58.805
and consumed whole
In a smgle mouthful.

02:02.450 --> 02:04.645
- Ortolans are endangered.

02:06.820 --> 02:09.118
- Who amongst us is not?

02:10.890 --> 02:12.858
- I haven't been
gorged, drowned,

02:12.900 --> 02:14.891
plucked, and roasted.

02:14.930 --> 02:16.727
Not yet.

02:16.770 --> 02:19.193
- Traditionally,
during this meal,

02:19.240 --> 02:22.539
we are to place
shrouds over our heads,

02:22.570 --> 02:25.334
hiding our faces from God.

02:25.370 --> 02:28.203
I don't hide from God.

02:40.990 --> 02:43.220
- Bones and all?

02:43.260 --> 02:45.558
- Bones and all.

03:36.810 --> 03:40.644
After my first ortolan,
I was euphoric.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.342
A stimulating reminder

03:43.390 --> 03:45.415
of our power
over life and death.

03:48.460 --> 03:51.952
- I was euphoric
when I killed Freddie Lounds.

03:54.800 --> 03:57.928
- Tell me, did your heart race
when you murdered her?

04:01.300 --> 04:03.666
- No, it didn't.
- A low heart rate

04:03.710 --> 04:06.338
is a true_indicato_r
of one's capaCIty for Violence.

04:06.380 --> 04:08.974
Your design is evolving.

04:11.450 --> 04:14.339
Your choices affect the physical
structures of your brain.

04:16.320 --> 04:19.380
- Killing is changing
the way I think.

04:19.420 --> 04:21.456
- Yes.

04:29.470 --> 04:32.837
You must understand
that blood and breath

04:32.870 --> 04:34.929
are only elements
undergoing change

04:34.970 --> 04:37.859
to fuel your radiance.

04:37.910 --> 04:40.731
Just as the source of light
is burning.

05:24.050 --> 05:27.588
(theme music)

05:53.980 --> 05:57.108
- Orthodontics confirmed.

05:57.150 --> 05:59.118
It's Freddie Lounds.

05:59.150 --> 06:02.825
A little bit of kerosene,
fwoomp! Incendiary journalism.

06:02.860 --> 06:04.953
- See? no scabrous crust
on her chin.

06:04.990 --> 06:08.699
She was dead
before the match was struck.
- Blood's already pooled

06:08.730 --> 06:10.891
to the lowest parts of her body.
Been dead at least 24 hours.

06:10.930 --> 06:13.797
- Freddie had a longing
to be noticed.

06:15.870 --> 06:18.964
She was noticed.
- Freddie Lounds's

06:19.010 --> 06:20.978
ultimate failing
was her inability

06:21.010 --> 06:23.706
to keep herself out
of her own stories.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.469
- (coroner): There's more
to this story.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.476
Check it out.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.738
- Severely-burned bodies
tend to split along lines

06:30.790 --> 06:33.782
of musculature,
but that looks like an incision.

06:33.820 --> 06:36.118
- That's right.
He cut out her psoas muscles

06:36.160 --> 06:38.526
with, uh, it looks like
a hunting knife.

06:38.560 --> 06:40.448
- A peculiar trophy.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.663
- Why did he burn her?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.031
- Whoever did this
was not striking out

06:49.070 --> 06:51.129
against Miss Lounds's
exploitative brand

06:51.170 --> 06:53.638
of journalism.
This is something else.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.636
This is something sacred.

06:55.680 --> 06:58.046
- Freddie Lounds had to burn.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.547
She was fuel.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.889
Fire destroys and it creates.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.582
It is mythical.

07:10.630 --> 07:13.622
She won't rise from the ashes,

07:13.660 --> 07:16.788
but her killer will.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.529
- He's the one
to be noticed now.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.047
- There's no baby.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.082
It isn't even an embryo yet,

07:37.120 --> 07:39.179
but here I am,

07:39.220 --> 07:41.882
feeling maternal.

07:41.920 --> 07:44.923
- You conspired
with your unborn child

07:44.960 --> 07:47.793
to liberate yourself.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.765
You've_ made Will _
an unknowmg accomplice.

07:50.800 --> 07:54.531
- I got what I wanted
from Will...

07:54.570 --> 07:58.028
but I didn't understand
what I was taking

07:58.070 --> 08:00.106
until the strip turned blue.

08:04.680 --> 08:07.513
I'm not proud of myself.

08:07.550 --> 08:11.646
- Nor should you be.

08:11.690 --> 08:14.579
You said--
- I lied.

08:21.260 --> 08:23.228
- Did you know?

08:23.270 --> 08:26.228
- I was aware of Margot's goal
of having a child.

08:26.270 --> 08:29.489
I was not aware you were
the means to achieving it.

08:33.610 --> 08:35.305
- What do you want from me?

08:35.340 --> 08:38.104
- Nothing...

08:38.150 --> 08:40.118
or as_much _
as you'd like to give.

08:40.150 --> 08:43.779
- As much as_ I would like
to give?

08:43.820 --> 08:46.857
- I always thought men were an
optional extra in childrearing,

08:46.890 --> 08:51.088
so... I'm not opposed
to a male influence.

08:51.130 --> 08:53.155
As long as it's not my brother.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.998
He's not good
with children.

09:02.670 --> 09:04.763
- Come on, children.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.174
- What's your name?

09:10.210 --> 09:12.178
- Franklin.

09:12.210 --> 09:14.314
Do you like
horses, Franklin?

09:19.690 --> 09:21.954
VVhoa!
(horse whinnying)

09:32.330 --> 09:35.128
Where do you stay...

09:35.170 --> 09:38.765
Franklin?
- With Mama and Shirley.

09:38.810 --> 09:41.677
- Mama is not
your real mama, is she?

09:41.710 --> 09:43.849
- She's my foster.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.849
- Do you love Mama and Shirley?

09:46.880 --> 09:48.916
- And Kitty Cat.

09:48.950 --> 09:52.044
- And Kitty Cat, yes.

09:54.990 --> 09:58.027
Franklin...

09:58.060 --> 10:00.927
you can't stay there anymore

10:00.960 --> 10:04.020
with Mama and Shirley
and Kitty Cat.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.766
You have to go away.
- Who says?

10:06.800 --> 10:09.234
- The government says.
Mama lost her job

10:09.270 --> 10:12.637
and her approval
as a foster home.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.636
You can't see her
after this week.

10:14.680 --> 10:17.706
You can't see Kitty Cat after
this week either.
- Why not?

10:17.750 --> 10:20.810
Maybe they just,
they just don't

10:20.850 --> 10:23.239
want you anymore, Franklin.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.787
Is there something wrong
with you?

10:32.190 --> 10:34.920
There is, isn't there?

10:34.960 --> 10:38.327
Oh, here. Here now.

10:38.370 --> 10:41.168
Here we go.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.259
Can, can you put
your head back?

10:43.310 --> 10:45.870
Just like that. Perfect.

10:45.910 --> 10:48.071
Yes.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.078
Perfect.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.757
Have a chocolate.

11:07.260 --> 11:09.296
(Middle Eastern music)

11:38.460 --> 11:40.155
(woman screaming)

11:40.200 --> 11:42.191
(knocking on door)

11:55.810 --> 11:59.143
(dogs barking)

12:03.150 --> 12:05.038
_ - Do _we do
friendly Vi5its anymore?

12:05.090 --> 12:08.309
- This isn't a friendly visit.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.124
- Oh. Uh...

12:11.160 --> 12:13.128
What kind of visit is it?

12:13.160 --> 12:16.891
- I guess I'm trying to convince
myself of something.

12:19.900 --> 12:22.061
- You're worried
I killed Freddie Lounds.

12:22.100 --> 12:25.103
- Did you?

12:27.980 --> 12:30.301
- What do you think?

12:32.210 --> 12:34.474
- I think that's the wrong
answer to tell somebody

12:34.520 --> 12:37.944
who is already wondering
what you're capable of.

12:37.990 --> 12:40.356
- I told everyone

12:40.390 --> 12:42.483
Hannibal was a killer,

12:42.520 --> 12:45.853
and no one believed me.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.199
Just like _no one
would believe you

12:48.230 --> 12:51.119
if you said I was a killer.

12:52.900 --> 12:55.061
- I don't think
Hannibal is good for you

12:55.100 --> 12:57.239
and I think your relationship
is destructive.

12:57.270 --> 12:59.830
- Hannibal's good enough
for you.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.769
You should be afraid.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.554
I want you to have something.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.232
Whoever you are afraid of...

13:36.480 --> 13:39.404
...don't be afraid to use it.

13:39.450 --> 13:42.578
It takes 9mm rounds.

13:42.620 --> 13:45.043
Buy a box...

13:45.090 --> 13:48.912
find a range...

13:52.090 --> 13:54.320
Practice.

14:11.650 --> 14:13.618
- Please.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.982
- I would like
to tell you about camp.

14:18.020 --> 14:20.284
It was a wonderful
childhood experience

14:20.320 --> 14:22.288
that keeps
coming back to me.

14:22.320 --> 14:24.880
Papa paid for the whole thing,
every summer,

14:24.930 --> 14:29.253
all 125 campers
on Lake Michigan.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.598
- Your father
was a generous man.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.565
- I've continued
his charitable work today.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.160
Most of the campers
are unfortunates

14:37.210 --> 14:40.031
who will do anything
for a candy bar.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.332
Ha!Ha!Ha!

14:44.310 --> 14:47.518
Maybe I took advantage.
Maybe I was rough with them.

14:47.550 --> 14:50.189
I'm not holding
anything back.

14:50.220 --> 14:52.188
It's all OK.

14:52.220 --> 14:55.109
I got a walk on the charges.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.049
- What was your penance?
- I got 500 hours

14:58.090 --> 15:00.593
of community service.
I worked at the dog pound

15:00.630 --> 15:04.464
and I received
some court-ordered therapy.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.139
- Was therapy helpful?

15:07.170 --> 15:10.662
- I got the doctor involved
in something unethical,

15:10.710 --> 15:14.168
so he'd cut me some slack.

15:14.210 --> 15:17.008
- That's not helpful.

15:17.050 --> 15:20.315
- Papa called it
"altruistic punishment".

15:20.350 --> 15:22.545
- Mason...

15:22.580 --> 15:24.548
please...

15:24.590 --> 15:26.979
- Oh.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.299
Papa was a prodigy

15:43.340 --> 15:46.366
in the field of meat,
but his real

15:46.410 --> 15:49.937
genius was for human nature.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.310
He could look at a man...

15:54.350 --> 15:56.409
and see his weakness.

15:56.450 --> 15:58.486
- Your father is dead.

16:00.390 --> 16:03.427
A boy's illusions are no basis
for a man's life, Mason.

16:07.160 --> 16:09.697
Margot is the only family
you have left.

16:18.040 --> 16:20.008
- My sister loves me,
Dr. Lecter.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.508
She has to or she's destitute.

16:27.450 --> 16:30.988
- Vergers are
noted expansionists.

16:32.820 --> 16:35.983
- And I am the sole Verger heir.

16:40.100 --> 16:43.592
- Unless biology
provides another.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.802
- "Thou prepares
a table before me

16:53.840 --> 16:56.308
"in the presence
of mine enemies.

16:56.340 --> 16:58.706
"Thou anointest
my head With 0il,

16:58.750 --> 17:00.718
"my cup runneth over.

17:00.750 --> 17:03.480
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

17:03.520 --> 17:05.579
"all the days of my life.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.588
"I will dwell in the house

17:07.620 --> 17:10.157
of the Lord forever."

17:22.170 --> 17:25.537
- I'm here to mourn
Freddie Lounds.

17:25.570 --> 17:28.607
Can't imagine
that's why you're here.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.608
- There's all sorts
of reasons

17:30.650 --> 17:32.606
why I'd go
to Freddie Lounds's funeral.

17:32.650 --> 17:35.619
It's common for a killer

17:35.650 --> 17:37.743
to revisit their victims
after death,

17:37.790 --> 17:39.746
attend funerals,

17:39.790 --> 17:41.781
return to crime scenes.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.621
- Anyone suspicious?
- Besides me?

17:45.660 --> 17:47.799
- That was implied.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.226
- You were expecting me.

17:52.270 --> 17:54.636
- "It's common for a killer

17:54.670 --> 17:57.537
to revisit their victims
after death."

17:57.570 --> 18:00.471
- I'm not here to dance
on Freddie Lounds's grave

18:00.510 --> 18:03.104
if that's what
you're getting at.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.539
- You're not here looking
for her killer, either.

18:05.580 --> 18:09.744
You don't seem particularly
interested in the crowd.

18:09.780 --> 18:14.410
- Are you profiling me,
Dr. Bloom?

18:22.330 --> 18:25.390
I'm here because...

18:27.400 --> 18:29.732
....my psychiatrist suggested

18:29.770 --> 18:31.806
it would be therapeutic.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.715
I've been so preoccupied with

18:48.760 --> 18:51.820
taking a life, I'm, uh...

18:51.860 --> 18:54.727
having trouble wrapping my head
around making one.

18:57.270 --> 19:00.569
- When men become fathers,
they undergo biochemical changes

19:00.600 --> 19:04.309
that affect the way they think.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.173
- You said the same thing
happens when men become killers.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.508
- Fathers can be killers.

19:12.650 --> 19:15.244
What sort of father
would you be?

19:17.350 --> 19:20.353
- I would be a good father.

19:20.390 --> 19:23.188
- How quickly
we form attachments

19:23.230 --> 19:24.925
to something
that does not yet exist.

19:24.960 --> 19:27.656
- I'm not attached. I'm...

19:27.700 --> 19:29.725
I'm only...

19:29.760 --> 19:32.228
anticipating attachment.

19:34.370 --> 19:36.338
- We have
a deep-seated need

19:36.370 --> 19:38.338
to interact
with our children.

19:38.370 --> 19:40.804
It helps us discover
who we are.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.846
- Have you ever been a father?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.713
- I was to my sister.

19:50.720 --> 19:53.416
She was not my child,
but she was my charge.

19:56.560 --> 19:58.881
She taught me so much
about myself.

20:00.900 --> 20:04.267
Her name was... Mischa.

20:05.870 --> 20:07.599
- Was?

20:07.640 --> 20:09.995
- She's dead.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.668
Abigail reminded me
so much of her.

20:19.350 --> 20:21.409
- Why did you kill her?

20:24.290 --> 20:27.418
- What happened to Abigail
had to happen.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.020
There was no other way.

20:30.060 --> 20:33.291
- There was.

20:36.430 --> 20:38.819
But there isn't now.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.796
- Would you protect this child
in the way

20:42.840 --> 20:44.831
you couldn't protect Abigail?

20:49.010 --> 20:51.570
- I still dream about Abigail.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.817
I dream that I'm...

20:57.850 --> 21:00.717
teaching her how to fish.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.423
- I'm sorry...

21:05.460 --> 21:07.599
I took that from you.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.366
Wish I could give it back.

21:17.100 --> 21:19.705
-SodoI.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.969
- Occasionally, I drop a teacup
to shatter on the floor.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.909
On purpose.

21:34.920 --> 21:38.321
I'm not satisfied when it
doesn't gather itself up again.

21:42.830 --> 21:45.321
Someday perhaps,

21:45.370 --> 21:47.998
a cup will come together.

22:22.070 --> 22:24.038
- Extra parts
were harvested on-site.

22:24.070 --> 22:27.369
- Just one night in the ground,
that beats Jesus by 48 hours.

22:27.410 --> 22:29.378
- Never thought Freddie Lounds
would make it to heaven,

22:29.410 --> 22:31.742
much less get deified.

22:43.730 --> 22:46.722
- This killer is trying
to get somebody's attention.

22:48.060 --> 22:51.120
- He has direction.

22:51.170 --> 22:54.492
His chaos is getting
more orderly.

22:54.540 --> 22:57.532
- So first, he burns effigies,
and now he's assembling them.

22:57.570 --> 23:01.802
- Burning Freddie Lounds
wasn't his first effigy.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.071
Whoever killed Freddie
killed Randall Tier,

23:05.110 --> 23:07.613
mutilated him, dismembered him,

23:07.650 --> 23:09.618
and put him on display.

23:09.650 --> 23:11.618
- (James): Randall Tier
and Freddie Lounds

23:11.650 --> 23:15.484
have a connection.
- Will.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.057
Randall Tier was his suspect

23:18.090 --> 23:20.422
and Hannibal's patient,

23:20.460 --> 23:22.451
and Fr_eddie_Lounds
was investigating

23:22.500 --> 23:24.468
his murder when she died.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.968
- Fre_ddie Lounds
was investigating

23:27.000 --> 23:30.538
a lot of things,
when she died.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.908
- This psychopath was incubating
fantasies about killing

23:38.950 --> 23:41.748
and is building himself up.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.943
Or someone's building him up.

23:44.990 --> 23:49.108
- He has a benefactor
who admires his destruction.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.196
Shiva is both destroyer
and benefactor.

23:59.200 --> 24:02.658
- He's being guided.

24:02.700 --> 24:06.466
- Is this some kind
of signpost?

24:09.080 --> 24:13.517
- Maybe Freddie's killer
didn't do this...

24:13.550 --> 24:17.919
maybe his benefactor did.

24:17.950 --> 24:19.713
- Why?

24:22.190 --> 24:24.920
- It's a courtship.

24:33.540 --> 24:35.531
- (Mason): Good morning!

24:43.080 --> 24:45.173
Riding agrees with you.

24:45.210 --> 24:47.178
Puts colour in your cheeks.

24:47.210 --> 24:50.646
You've got a bloom. Really.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.646
- It's chilly.

24:57.690 --> 25:00.181
I was lying in bed...

25:00.230 --> 25:02.858
composing in my mind
like the deaf Beethoven,

25:02.900 --> 25:04.868
and it occurred to me

25:04.900 --> 25:06.959
that for a family

25:07.000 --> 25:10.197
who owns breeding stock,

25:10.240 --> 25:13.061
we don't do
much of it ourselves.

25:13.110 --> 25:15.101
I'm concerned about

25:15.140 --> 25:18.303
the next generation
of Vergers. Aren't you?

25:18.350 --> 25:21.808
- I'm just trying
to survive this generation.

25:21.850 --> 25:23.818
(Mason laughing)

25:23.850 --> 25:26.944
- Meat is, at base,

25:26.990 --> 25:29.049
a people business.

25:29.090 --> 25:32.856
Nobody understood that better
than Papa, except now
for me of course.

25:32.890 --> 25:36.189
Papa would take me out of school
for weeks at a time

25:36.230 --> 25:40.223
while he conducted my, my...
my real education

25:40.270 --> 25:44.138
in livestock, slaughterhouses.

25:44.170 --> 25:47.571
(horse whinnying)

25:47.610 --> 25:51.341
I need to share this wealth

25:51.380 --> 25:53.769
with a little Verger.

25:53.820 --> 25:57.586
- "A little Verger."
- Don't you want an heir,

25:57.620 --> 26:00.111
Margot?

26:00.150 --> 26:02.653
I want a baby Verger,

26:02.690 --> 26:04.658
my own baby.

26:04.690 --> 26:07.124
I have viable sperm.

26:07.160 --> 26:10.129
I think I'd have a son.
It'd be your heir too.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.822
Auntie Margot...

26:17.970 --> 26:20.359
I think a child

26:20.410 --> 26:24.244
may be what we need
to bring us closer together.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.216
- Maybe it is.

26:32.020 --> 26:33.954
- I've said it before,

26:33.990 --> 26:36.049
you've got a bloom.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.919
Rosy.

26:42.660 --> 26:46.619
Positively radiant.

26:46.670 --> 26:49.332
What is your secret?

26:55.740 --> 26:57.708
- Every creative act

26:57.750 --> 27:00.742
has its destructive
consequence, Will.

27:00.780 --> 27:03.078
The Hindu god Shiva

27:03.120 --> 27:06.089
is simultaneous
destroyer and creator.

27:08.090 --> 27:10.411
Who you were yesterday
is laid waste

27:10.460 --> 27:12.951
to give rise
to who you are today.

27:14.900 --> 27:18.996
- How many lies have had
to be... sanctified?

27:21.000 --> 27:25.061
How many consciences...
devastated?

27:25.110 --> 27:28.102
- As many as were necessary.

27:32.210 --> 27:34.747
- You sacrificed Abigail.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.688
You cared about her

27:38.720 --> 27:41.814
as much as I did.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.919
- Maybe more.

27:45.930 --> 27:48.956
But then, how much

27:49.000 --> 27:52.128
has God sacrificed?

27:54.770 --> 27:57.398
- What god do you pray to?

27:57.440 --> 27:59.829
- I don't pray.

27:59.870 --> 28:02.976
I have not been bothered
by any considerations of deity,

28:03.010 --> 28:06.377
other than to recognize
how my own modest actions

28:06.410 --> 28:09.971
pale beside those of God.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.012
- I prayed...

28:15.020 --> 28:17.352
...I would see Abigail again.

28:19.760 --> 28:21.853
- Well, your prayer
did not go entirely unanswered.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.891
You saw part of her.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.936
Will...

28:27.970 --> 28:31.235
should the universe contract,

28:31.270 --> 28:33.830
should time reverse

28:33.880 --> 28:37.748
and teacups come together...

28:37.780 --> 28:41.739
a place could be made
for Abigail in your world.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.886
- What place would that be?

28:47.890 --> 28:51.280
- You've lost a child, Will.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.992
It seems you're likely
to gain one.

28:57.160 --> 29:00.027
God is beyond measure

29:00.070 --> 29:03.039
in wanton malice...

29:03.070 --> 29:06.130
and matchless in his irony.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.164
- No, no, no.
Cancel that one.

29:37.270 --> 29:41.309
I remember

29:41.340 --> 29:44.173
walking the swine fairs

29:44.210 --> 29:46.246
with my father,

29:46.280 --> 29:48.840
looking over the competition.

29:48.880 --> 29:50.882
Papa's little silver knife

29:50.920 --> 29:54.811
ever ready
to slip out of his waistcoat

29:54.860 --> 29:57.556
and stick into the back of a pig

29:57.590 --> 30:00.024
to check the depth of fat.

30:00.060 --> 30:03.427
- Your education was an odd one.

30:03.460 --> 30:06.167
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

30:08.170 --> 30:10.365
Oh, those were good,
funny times.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.937
Papa would stab

30:12.970 --> 30:15.006
4-H show pigs

30:15.040 --> 30:17.008
who thought
everyone was their friend,

30:17.040 --> 30:20.100
scrubbed in milk
and baby powder.

30:20.150 --> 30:22.311
Such coddled little things.

30:26.250 --> 30:30.152
- Part of a show pig's
consideration is its happiness.

30:30.190 --> 30:33.057
- If we were truly considerate

30:33.090 --> 30:35.854
of a pig's happiness...

30:35.900 --> 30:38.061
we wouldn't eat them.

30:38.100 --> 30:41.297
- What about Margot's happiness?

30:41.340 --> 30:43.399
- Papa taught me
how to stick the knife in

30:43.440 --> 30:45.408
only as deep as necessary,

30:45.440 --> 30:48.603
to test the thickness
of her skin.

30:50.610 --> 30:53.647
- You miscalculated...

30:53.680 --> 30:55.944
struck a nerve.

30:55.980 --> 30:59.313
- Margot would love
to stick a knife into me,

30:59.350 --> 31:02.353
and it wouldn't be to test
the thickness of my skin.

31:02.390 --> 31:05.188
- She tried
to kill you once already.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.585
- "To a male heir

31:07.630 --> 31:10.098
confirmed as my descendent..."

31:10.130 --> 31:12.360
It's a very clever loophole

31:12.400 --> 31:14.368
she's found in Papa's will.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.960
Clearly, he did not
take into account

31:17.000 --> 31:20.504
how resourceful she is.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.348
- Neither did you.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.405
- I can be resourceful too.

31:26.450 --> 31:29.419
If she's not pregnant,
she will be.

31:29.450 --> 31:32.886
Margot's very tenacious
that way.

31:34.990 --> 31:38.482
- This child would be a Verger.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.693
You would have an heir
to carry on the family name,

31:41.730 --> 31:44.597
to carry on your name.

31:44.630 --> 31:47.121
- I'd have an heir...

31:47.170 --> 31:49.934
only ifI die.

31:49.970 --> 31:52.006
(He scoffs.)

31:54.380 --> 31:56.632
One observes only things

31:56.680 --> 31:58.671
which are already
on the mind.

32:02.020 --> 32:04.079
What's on your mind?

32:05.750 --> 32:08.082
- I'm feeling pressure to
believe something I don't trust,

32:08.120 --> 32:10.213
and that pressure

32:10.260 --> 32:13.149
is making me paranoid.

32:13.190 --> 32:16.921
- Who's pressuring you?

32:18.700 --> 32:22.090
- Will.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.679
- We'll never really
be alone, will we?

32:29.710 --> 32:33.146
He'll always be in the room.

32:35.150 --> 32:38.381
- Do you feel like you're
helping him? Making progress?

32:38.420 --> 32:41.218
- Will is finally
finding himself.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.285
He's getting better.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.720
- Doesn't seem
to be getting better.

32:48.500 --> 32:51.060
- Are you questioning
my therapy?

32:53.130 --> 32:55.132
- I'm questioning everything.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.700
It's all blurry and subjective.

33:02.740 --> 33:05.277
I feel empty,

33:05.310 --> 33:07.471
like I've given blood.

33:12.390 --> 33:15.211
- Alana, you've given
more than blood.

33:55.400 --> 33:58.597
Have you been firing a gun?

34:00.700 --> 34:03.669
- I told you
I was feeling paranoid.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.252
(machine beeping)

35:35.230 --> 35:37.596
- Poor Margot...

35:37.630 --> 35:40.360
you just can't win.

35:49.910 --> 35:52.606
I have to...

35:52.650 --> 35:55.175
remove this temptation.

35:55.220 --> 35:57.711
(Margot breathing hard)

36:08.700 --> 36:11.624
They're going
to find something wrong

36:11.670 --> 36:14.332
with your lady parts, Margot.

36:14.370 --> 36:16.736
Or so the record will state.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.928
The doctor will advise me

36:20.970 --> 36:23.530
that it's best

36:23.580 --> 36:26.276
if they take...

36:26.310 --> 36:28.278
everything.

36:28.320 --> 36:31.346
I'm afraid the only person

36:31.390 --> 36:33.745
you'll be celebrating
Mother's Day with

36:33.790 --> 36:37.385
is me.

37:09.390 --> 37:11.779
- The most terrifying thing
in the world

37:11.830 --> 37:13.650
can be a lucid moment.

37:17.900 --> 37:19.959
What are you up to?

37:23.300 --> 37:25.632
- I'm not sure I know what
you're talking about, Dr. Bloom.

37:32.750 --> 37:36.015
- I think you know.

37:36.050 --> 37:38.280
You're not fooling me, Jack.

37:38.320 --> 37:41.881
- I'm not trying to fool you.
- You're lying.

37:41.920 --> 37:45.356
You're all lying.

37:45.390 --> 37:48.291
Will. Hannibal.

37:48.330 --> 37:51.367
You're lying to each other,
and they're lying to you.

37:51.400 --> 37:53.891
- Tell me what you believe
is happening.

37:53.930 --> 37:55.898
- What do I believe?

37:55.940 --> 37:58.033
What do you believe?

38:02.040 --> 38:04.474
Do you believe
Will killed Freddie Lounds?

38:04.510 --> 38:06.740
- No, I don't.

38:06.780 --> 38:09.578
- Do you think Dr. Chilton's
the Chesapeake Ripper?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.282
- There was overwhelming--
- STOP LYING, JACK!

38:17.390 --> 38:19.529
(Sigh)

38:19.560 --> 38:23.451
You think you've moved
your pieces around so cleverly.

38:25.830 --> 38:28.560
- What's changed, Alana?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.761
- I have no confidence

38:30.800 --> 38:33.439
that I know
Hannibal Lecter anymore.

38:35.780 --> 38:39.477
Even with as much as you know
or think you know Hannibal,
you don't know him either.

38:41.550 --> 38:43.871
And you don't know Will.

38:43.920 --> 38:47.708
You are going to lose, Jack!

38:51.160 --> 38:53.583
If you haven't lost already.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.361
- I want you to come with me.

39:24.430 --> 39:26.625
- How was my funeral?

39:32.170 --> 39:34.491
(machine beeping)

40:09.800 --> 40:12.530
(strange tribal song)

40:16.710 --> 40:18.803
(Middle Eastern music)

40:36.530 --> 40:38.919
(The music stops abruptly.)
- Carlo?

40:38.970 --> 40:43.088
Carlo, I don't think
they've had enough to...

40:51.240 --> 40:53.447
You must be the baby daddy.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.048
Excuse me if I_don't
offer you a Cigar.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.993
I'm gonna feed you
to my pigs. Carlo!

41:15.040 --> 41:17.736
(Mason laughing crazily)

41:17.770 --> 41:20.466
(both grunting)

41:22.680 --> 41:25.649
- Do you think it was
Margot's idea to have an heir?

41:27.650 --> 41:31.689
You think it was your idea
to take it from her?

41:31.720 --> 41:34.086
My idea

41:34.120 --> 41:37.715
to come here and kill you?

41:37.760 --> 41:41.252
The only thing
that you, your sister,

41:41.290 --> 41:44.020
and I have in common

41:44.060 --> 41:48.121
is the same psychiatrist.

41:56.840 --> 41:59.877
(Mason laughs.)

42:01.950 --> 42:04.885
If Dr. Lecter
had his druthers...

42:04.920 --> 42:09.516
you'd be wrapped
around a bullet right now.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.657
(Will uncocks the gun.)

42:17.860 --> 42:21.023
Dr. Lecter is the one you want
to be feeding to your pigs.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.742
