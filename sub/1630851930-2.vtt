09:11.368 --> 09:12.850
Denny's right.

09:12.852 --> 09:15.737
But let's hope there's a free
shrimp amendment in the works.

09:15.739 --> 09:16.955
[ chuckles ] right bobby?

09:16.957 --> 09:18.456
[ laughs ]

09:18.458 --> 09:20.158
yeah, you think
everything's free

09:20.160 --> 09:21.526
'cause you got
a badge.

09:21.528 --> 09:23.161
Whoa, why am I
catching shrapnel?

09:23.163 --> 09:25.630
And while we're at it,
there's also no freedom

09:25.632 --> 09:28.133
to take tom clancy novels
off the shelf

09:28.135 --> 09:30.969
and read them in the bathroom
one dump at a time.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.388
That's a lie!
I-I would never do that.

09:33.390 --> 09:35.473
Well, these fiesta mix
fingerprints

09:35.475 --> 09:37.559
tell a different story,
don't they?

09:37.561 --> 09:39.477
Lifetime ban!

09:39.479 --> 09:40.929
I hear someone getting
banned over here?

09:40.931 --> 09:42.647
You need some help
from the banisher?

09:42.649 --> 09:45.100
Who invited
the midlife-crisis militia?

09:45.102 --> 09:47.102
You talking smack
about the tuff lads?

09:47.104 --> 09:49.821
You wanna throw hands?
Stay out of this, banisher.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.690
Ellis, give me
my low-t shot.

09:51.692 --> 09:53.224
Yeah.
I don't know, man.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.860
I have my pants down, and now
I look stupid, ellis.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.112
Sorry, bro,
I got to bolt.

09:57.114 --> 09:58.730
Ellis, you took the oath!

09:58.732 --> 10:00.081
I hit you with the cereal!

10:00.083 --> 10:02.534
So you're the one who opened
this frooty puffz.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.752
Lifetime ban!

10:03.754 --> 10:05.870
Uh, you don't ban
the banisher.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.740
The banisher is the one
who bans.

10:09.459 --> 10:11.126
You know this has
happened before?

10:11.128 --> 10:13.261
1942, a little country
called germany.

10:13.263 --> 10:15.647
No, it's nothing
like the holocaust, glenn.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.915
Come on.

10:17.551 --> 10:21.453
Yeah, I guess was radicalized
online after my divorce.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.557
But you have no idea what white
guys go through in this country.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.859
[ sighs ] it just feels good to
be heard, you know?

10:27.861 --> 10:29.427
I do hear you, glenn.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.197
'cause at dan's lucky buck,
we have freedom of speech.

10:32.199 --> 10:34.932
And don't forget, we recently
added the inalienable

10:34.934 --> 10:36.601
right to free shrimp...

10:36.603 --> 10:37.569
...Ish!

10:37.571 --> 10:39.937
We be pimpin'
shrimpish, y'all!

10:39.939 --> 10:41.489
Mmm! Tastes just
like chicken!

10:41.491 --> 10:43.375
Yeah, that's 'cause it's
chicken nuggets

10:43.377 --> 10:45.076
cut out
with a shrimp stencil.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.211
Don't -- don't
eat them all!

10:46.213 --> 10:47.912
One per customer!
One!

10:47.914 --> 10:50.215
Uh, do you guys
sell assault rifles?

10:50.217 --> 10:52.217
For a dollar?
[ chuckles ]

10:52.219 --> 10:53.752
how about a laser pointer?

10:53.754 --> 10:55.420
Red dot!
Get the red dot!

10:55.422 --> 10:56.788
-Get the dot!
-Look at the dot!

10:56.790 --> 10:58.056
Look! It's in
the parking lot now!

10:58.058 --> 10:59.307
It's getting away!

10:59.309 --> 11:01.142
It's hiding in
the sewer drains!

11:01.144 --> 11:03.228
Down, down you go!

11:04.798 --> 11:06.748
It's the only way to get them
out of the store.
