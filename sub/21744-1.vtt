13:58.505 --> 14:01.800

14:02.926 --> 14:05.262

…friends…

…our homes, money…

14:17.357 --> 14:18.692
No.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.696
Above all, humans love fear.

14:23.614 --> 14:29.786
The fear that, over time, we have honed
and polished and built up, brick by brick,

14:29.870 --> 14:35.459
until it stands before us
every day as tall as the Trump Tower.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.921
How do I know we love fear
more than our children?

14:39.004 --> 14:41.423
Because we are willing to ruin their lives

14:41.507 --> 14:44.593

irrational fear of losing them.

that they don't have to think anymore,

15:26.552 --> 15:28.053
that they don't have
to want for anything anymore.

15:28.136 --> 15:31.139
Fear will release them from their desires
and their ambitions

15:31.223 --> 15:32.724

In fifth grade, Marci Ross found

put our education on hold

43:55.594 --> 43:56.970
It was the clowns.

43:59.473 --> 44:01.058
<i>I saw them get out of the ice cream truck.</i>

44:01.141 --> 44:03.393
<i>They just stood there and stared at me.</i>

44:04.228 --> 44:06.730
Winter! Winter!

44:07.397 --> 44:08.982
Dude, slow down.

44:09.274 --> 44:10.817
(WHISPERING)
But you have to see this.

44:16.615 --> 44:17.950
(GROANS)

44:18.325 --> 44:19.535
What is wrong with you?

44:25.832 --> 44:28.460
Can we go back?
We're not supposed to be outside.

44:33.298 --> 44:34.633
(MARYLIN SCREAMING)

44:36.844 --> 44:37.928
Shh.

44:57.614 --> 44:58.699
(GRUNTS)

44:58.782 --> 45:00.117
Come here. I'll lift you up.

45:00.659 --> 45:01.952
Tell me what you see.

45:02.870 --> 45:04.580
-(MARYLIN GRUNTING)
-TOM: Please. (GROANS)

45:05.289 --> 45:06.373
(MUFFLED YELLING)

45:12.713 --> 45:14.756
(MARYLIN CRYING, GROANING)

45:17.593 --> 45:19.011
(MUFFLED SCREAMING)

45:30.314 --> 45:32.816
I tried to tell the police,
but she won't let me.

45:33.317 --> 45:35.777
Oz, why don't you go inside?

45:35.861 --> 45:37.404
Your moms will be in in a second.

45:37.487 --> 45:40.199
Now you want to look after him?
Are you fucking kidding me?

45:41.575 --> 45:43.118
Officer, would you take him
over there for just…

45:43.202 --> 45:44.661
-Ivy, no.
-Just for a second.

45:45.037 --> 45:46.246
Please, honey.

45:47.748 --> 45:48.916
Just for a second.

45:48.999 --> 45:50.042
(WHISPERING) It's okay, baby.

45:54.254 --> 45:57.758
Look, I'm not calling your son a liar.

45:57.841 --> 46:01.178
He's an imaginative kid,
but none of that happened.

46:01.261 --> 46:03.514
We came out here when we saw
a bunch of police cars pull up.

46:03.847 --> 46:05.432
That was after I found this in his room.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.435
Oh. Oh, my God.

46:08.519 --> 46:09.686
Oh, my God.

46:09.770 --> 46:11.230
Should have thrown it away.

46:11.522 --> 46:13.732
-Oh, my God.
-He has night terrors.

46:13.815 --> 46:15.692
He doesn't even know he's asleep.

46:16.610 --> 46:18.028
Oh, my God, Ivy.

46:18.862 --> 46:19.988
Oh, God.

46:20.072 --> 46:21.365
Don't look.

46:21.949 --> 46:23.450
Look, there's that detective.

46:23.534 --> 46:24.952
Detective.

46:25.035 --> 46:26.578
Can you tell us what happened?

46:26.662 --> 46:28.205
I'm sorry, ma'am,
I can't talk about it right now.

46:28.288 --> 46:29.665
ALLY: Oh, that's bullshit.

46:29.748 --> 46:31.917
The Changs were our friends.
We know them.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.503
What happened in there?
Who did this?

46:34.795 --> 46:35.879
Are we even safe here?

46:35.963 --> 46:39.007
You're gonna be fine.
There was nobody else involved.

46:39.174 --> 46:40.968
It looks like a murder suicide.

46:42.010 --> 46:43.345
I'm sorry.

47:29.892 --> 47:31.268
(THUMPING)

47:36.440 --> 47:37.608
(WHISPERING) Ivy?

47:38.901 --> 47:40.694
Ivy, did you hear that?

47:42.154 --> 47:43.405
Ivy?

47:44.156 --> 47:45.282
