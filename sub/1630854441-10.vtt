WEBVTT

00:05.875 --> 00:08.051
Oh, dear.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.907
Car trouble?

00:37.907 --> 00:39.517
And on my way back
from the market

00:39.517 --> 00:42.303
with a pot roast
already in the oven.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.783
I don't suppose you'd mind
giving me a ride to town

00:44.783 --> 00:47.047
so I can find someone
who can fix this?

00:47.047 --> 00:49.136
Wouldn't mind at all,

00:49.136 --> 00:51.225
but let me see
if I can help you first.

00:51.225 --> 00:53.096
You really know about cars?

00:53.096 --> 00:55.142
And my husband's
the Julia Child of the family.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.231
Oh!

00:57.231 --> 00:59.363
Hmm.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.887
I'm guessing you have
a loose drive belt.

01:01.887 --> 01:04.629
It's an easy fix with a wrench
and some sweat.

01:04.629 --> 01:06.849
Oh, my husband keeps
a toolbox in the trunk.

01:06.849 --> 01:08.807
Wait here.

01:08.807 --> 01:11.984
What are the odds, huh?
A gal who's good with cars

01:11.984 --> 01:15.075
happening down this same way.

01:19.427 --> 01:20.689
Hmm.

01:32.135 --> 01:36.487
I sure am lucky.
Wouldn't you agree?

01:36.487 --> 01:37.923
Dorothea.

02:03.514 --> 02:04.907
Okay, you're all set.

02:04.907 --> 02:06.604
Anything breaks
into your hideout,

02:06.604 --> 02:09.955
this box will let you know. Loudly.

02:09.955 --> 02:11.566
How's it work?

02:11.566 --> 02:14.656
A rare and dangerous magic
called technology.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.180
Relays, inverter relays, circuitry

02:17.180 --> 02:18.877
all wired
through the phone lines

02:18.877 --> 02:20.183
to pressure switches

02:20.183 --> 02:22.011
mounted on the clubhouse entrances.

02:22.011 --> 02:24.579
Nice. Thank you.

02:24.579 --> 02:26.972
Just doing my part.
Now, if I could just get

02:26.972 --> 02:28.974
that monster-box of yours
working again.

02:28.974 --> 02:32.021
- Any luck with the Ostium?
- Well, at this point,

02:32.021 --> 02:35.155
I have ruled out
replacing the carburetor.

02:35.155 --> 02:40.072
Later, alligators.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.597
All right, where were we?

02:42.597 --> 02:45.208
Well, your dad and Ada are
still out looking for magic

02:45.208 --> 02:47.428
to defeat the Akrida,
and Carlos and Lata

02:47.428 --> 02:51.954
are searching the Akrida queen,
so that leaves us with...

02:51.954 --> 02:54.652
deep cuts from the
Men of Letters back catalogue.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.350
Hooray.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.047
There has to be
something in here

02:58.047 --> 03:00.484
about taking out the Akrida.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.882
KSU?

03:06.882 --> 03:08.840
You about to trade me in

03:08.840 --> 03:10.538
for a guy with elbow patches
on his jacket?

03:10.538 --> 03:14.716
Don't wig out, soldier boy.
It's close to home.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.632
Well, open it.

03:17.632 --> 03:20.504
- What if I don't get in?
- Well...

03:20.504 --> 03:22.680
KSU is a pretty big
party school,

03:22.680 --> 03:24.334
so that probably rules you out.

03:24.334 --> 03:27.337
Hey!

03:27.337 --> 03:29.600
I don't even know
what I'm gonna study.

03:29.600 --> 03:32.212
I'm pretty sure
that's the point of undergrad.

03:35.345 --> 03:38.261
Here. I'll read it for you.

03:47.923 --> 03:48.967
What?

03:51.840 --> 03:54.277
I got in?

03:54.277 --> 03:56.192
I got in.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.976
A normal life's right around
the corner for you, Campbell.

04:06.550 --> 04:08.073
Think it's a glitch?

04:08.073 --> 04:09.597
With our luck?

04:09.597 --> 04:13.253
Normal life is gonna have
to wait another day.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.648
<i>Hunting and happy endings
don't usually mix,</i>

04:17.648 --> 04:20.042
<i>so when you get your chance,
you got to ask yourself,</i>

04:20.042 --> 04:22.784
<i>"How far will I go to get it?"</i>

04:26.483 --> 04:29.747
Well, this has been
a spectacular failure.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.836
We've scoured every location
Samuel suspected

04:31.836 --> 04:34.709
the Akrida queen could be
and found nothing.

04:34.709 --> 04:36.406
I mean, perhaps
we should circle back,

04:36.406 --> 04:38.321
check our work.

04:38.321 --> 04:41.019
Yeah. I was thinking
the same thing.

04:41.019 --> 04:45.546
Of course, that could be
a colossal waste of time.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.112
Totally agree.

04:49.419 --> 04:52.335
Or I could take a machete
from your collection

04:52.335 --> 04:54.206
and chop you up
into tiny, little bits.

04:54.206 --> 04:56.731
Sounds great.
Wait, what?

04:56.731 --> 05:01.170
You haven't heard
a word I've said, have you?

05:01.170 --> 05:02.954
You've been distracted
this entire trip.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.739
Missing exits,

05:04.739 --> 05:06.480
forgetting your silver blade
at the diner last night.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.698
I didn't forget
my silver blade.

05:07.698 --> 05:09.700
Yes, you did.

05:09.700 --> 05:13.443
Come on. What's on your mind?

05:13.443 --> 05:15.358
Is it the Akrida?

05:15.358 --> 05:17.447
The whole end of the world bit?

05:21.799 --> 05:23.061
It's Anton.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.411
I thought things
were going well.

05:24.411 --> 05:25.760
Yeah, that's the problem.

05:25.760 --> 05:28.415
I can't stop
thinking about him.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.505
I even saw his beautiful,
round, dimpled face

05:31.505 --> 05:33.768
in my blueberry pancakes
I ordered this morning.

05:33.768 --> 05:36.727
So things are getting serious.

05:38.860 --> 05:40.862
I can't believe
I'm actually saying this,

05:40.862 --> 05:43.821
but I'm...

05:45.954 --> 05:47.347
Taking things slow.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.174
And that's a bad thing
because?

05:49.174 --> 05:52.569
Because taking things slow
and seeing faces in pancakes

05:52.569 --> 05:54.963
is for stupid, boring people

05:54.963 --> 05:56.617
who don't have
the fate of the world

05:56.617 --> 05:59.663
on their excellently
proportioned shoulders.

05:59.663 --> 06:02.013
No, but it's fine, all right?
I know what I have to do.

06:02.013 --> 06:05.060
- No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

06:05.060 --> 06:06.366
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.715
Ow.
- Proportioned shoulders.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.412
You are not
breaking up with him.

06:09.412 --> 06:11.806
- What do you expect me to do?
- Oh, I don't know.

06:11.806 --> 06:14.330
Maybe accept your feelings
instead of throwing them away.

06:14.330 --> 06:16.158
I mean, remember Raquel?
Or Beth?

06:16.158 --> 06:19.422
Or sad, sad, little Kevin?
- No, no, no, not really.

06:19.422 --> 06:21.642
And that's kind of
the whole goal.

06:21.642 --> 06:23.470
And just like
all lovers of yore,

06:23.470 --> 06:28.083
alas, it is time to officially
end things with Anton.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.955
And forget
what I need to forget.

06:35.003 --> 06:37.701
Wait a minute.
Maybe that's the answer.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.833
Well, thank you.
I'm glad you see

06:38.833 --> 06:40.312
I make a compelling argument.

06:40.312 --> 06:42.706
Okay, no. Not you. Hush.
You're an idiot.

06:42.706 --> 06:44.752
I'm talking about
finding the Akrida queen.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.841
Every person we freed
from the Akrida's control

06:46.841 --> 06:49.452
had one of those monsters
in their head, right?

06:49.452 --> 06:52.412
If they still have memories
from that time,

06:52.412 --> 06:55.240
perhaps one of them might be
able to help us.

06:57.242 --> 07:01.682
And I might just know
the right person to see

07:01.682 --> 07:02.770
if you are right.

07:08.950 --> 07:10.212
Oh, my God.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.318
That's mildly disturbing.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.060
Are these alphabetized?

07:32.060 --> 07:33.757
You know of any monsters
that like to break in

07:33.757 --> 07:35.977
and clean up in record time?

07:35.977 --> 07:37.152
Mary Poppins.

07:41.373 --> 07:45.029
Wait, is Mary Poppins... no.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.902
Ah, right on schedule.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.078
May I pour you some chamomile?

07:50.078 --> 07:51.862
Who the hell are you
and what are you doing here?

07:51.862 --> 07:54.343
I might ask the same of you.

07:54.343 --> 07:57.128
My name is Porter J. Hobbes,

07:57.128 --> 08:00.523
Men of Letters
identification number 22-8,

08:00.523 --> 08:06.268
and I used my key to come here
to help you.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.096
Help us with what?

08:08.096 --> 08:10.446
Well, with the task at hand,
of course.

08:10.446 --> 08:13.405
Killing the Akrida queen.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.331
Well, his bona fides
check out.

08:26.331 --> 08:28.682
- No Akrida marks.
- Holy water?

08:28.682 --> 08:31.859
Drank the whole glass.
Thanked me for it.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.600
Guy's definitely human.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.516
Think we can trust him?

08:39.301 --> 08:40.824
Hey, Tea Time,
the Men of Letters

08:40.824 --> 08:43.131
got wiped out years ago,
so we're gonna need

08:43.131 --> 08:44.959
the full encyclopedia entry

08:44.959 --> 08:47.265
of who you are
and where the hell you've been.

08:47.265 --> 08:49.703
I must say
I am pleasantly surprised.

08:49.703 --> 08:52.096
It was my experience
Hunters stab first

08:52.096 --> 08:54.708
and ask questions never.

08:56.884 --> 09:01.541
Everything in its place.

09:01.541 --> 09:05.283
I was a neurosurgeon
until a very charming gentleman

09:05.283 --> 09:08.460
named Mr. Glass recruited me
into the Men of Letters.

09:08.460 --> 09:12.073
I was honored to serve
as their master physician.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.683
You stitched up members.

09:13.683 --> 09:15.990
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.906
Men of Letters rarely got
their hands dirty.

09:18.906 --> 09:20.777
No, I was brought in

09:20.777 --> 09:24.085
to experiment
on the minds of monsters.

09:24.085 --> 09:27.044
Wait, so the monster morgue downstairs,

09:27.044 --> 09:28.611
that's your office?
- Yes.

09:28.611 --> 09:32.093
I singlehandedly designed
and built the laboratory

09:32.093 --> 09:34.225
to conduct
my research experiments.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.315
I was mostly tasked with
turning monsters into watchdogs

09:37.315 --> 09:39.274
to guard
our more secure locations.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.929
A lobotomy
to the frontal cortex

09:41.929 --> 09:44.975
makes many a monster subservient.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.673
So where have you been?

09:46.673 --> 09:48.326
I retired to return

09:48.326 --> 09:52.635
to my private practice
about 15 years ago.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.419
When you worked here,
did you know my father?

09:54.419 --> 09:56.030
Henry Winchester.
He was an initiate.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.293
Uh, I apologize,

09:58.293 --> 10:01.035
but that name
doesn't ring any bells.

10:01.035 --> 10:04.821
If your father was a member,
that makes you a legacy then.

10:04.821 --> 10:09.043
Oh, how wonderful
for your family.

10:09.043 --> 10:12.612
I never had time
to have one of my own.

10:16.137 --> 10:18.052
Do you know what happened
to the Men of Letters?

10:18.052 --> 10:21.446
My best guess: the Akrida.

10:21.446 --> 10:24.667
Shortly before my retirement,
they had returned.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.017
We managed to push them back
to their own world.

10:27.017 --> 10:28.802
- With the Ostium?
- Indeed,

10:28.802 --> 10:31.456
but we suffered
severe casualties.

10:31.456 --> 10:35.330
They retreated, but some
of them remained hidden.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.811
Including...
- The queen.

10:37.811 --> 10:40.596
Yes, indeed.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.077
I retired,

10:43.077 --> 10:45.601
but I continued to study them.

10:45.601 --> 10:48.038
And when I found out they were
staging another attack,

10:48.038 --> 10:50.867
I amped up my research,

10:50.867 --> 10:55.350
and I'd like to share with you
what I uncovered.

11:02.052 --> 11:04.576
<i>Hello? Anyone in there?</i>

11:13.585 --> 11:16.458
Lata,

11:16.458 --> 11:18.808
is she dead?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.726
The hell you want?

11:23.726 --> 11:27.338
It's okay.
We just want to talk.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.695
Where I do I know you from?

11:35.695 --> 11:38.045
We've crossed paths
a few times,

11:38.045 --> 11:40.656
although
you might not remember.

11:40.656 --> 11:43.093
Radio station said
we might find you here.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.444
Was that before or after

11:46.444 --> 11:48.751
they told you they took me
off the air?

11:48.751 --> 11:52.581
They did mention
there was a parting of ways.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.322
Yeah, well...

11:54.322 --> 11:55.976
going AWOL for weeks on end

11:55.976 --> 11:58.543
doesn't exactly make you
employee of the month.

12:01.982 --> 12:05.115
So what do you want?

12:05.115 --> 12:06.900
We're here about the Akrida.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.382
That's some...

12:11.382 --> 12:13.645
some band you're hawking?

12:13.645 --> 12:15.212
I never heard of them.

12:15.212 --> 12:17.040
Look, I think it's time
for you guys to go.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.346
We think you know.

12:21.175 --> 12:26.006
You're just afraid
to tell anyone because...

12:26.006 --> 12:27.703
because of
what they did to you.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.358
We're here
because we want to help you.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.631
Who the hell are you and

12:42.631 --> 12:45.721
how can you help me
with my nightmares?

12:45.721 --> 12:49.464
I know this isn't easy, but
the things you're remembering,

12:49.464 --> 12:53.250
they aren't bad dreams.
They're real.

12:57.254 --> 13:01.041
I thought I was going crazy.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.651
That was the only explanation.

13:02.651 --> 13:04.305
No.

13:04.305 --> 13:08.265
No one here
thinks you're crazy.

13:08.265 --> 13:11.791
But we do want to stop this
from happening to anyone else,

13:11.791 --> 13:14.184
but in order to do that,
we need you

13:14.184 --> 13:16.926
to tell us exactly
what you remember.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.583
I can't.

13:21.583 --> 13:25.413
It's all fragments and pieces.

13:25.413 --> 13:28.068
And I don't want
to remember anymore.

13:28.068 --> 13:30.810
All right?
This--this episode,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.855
this break,
whatever you want to call it,

13:32.855 --> 13:37.686
it has taken
everything from me.

13:37.686 --> 13:40.732
My girlfriend.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.691
My job.

13:42.691 --> 13:45.128
My apartment.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.871
Gone.

13:48.871 --> 13:52.744
All I want to do now
is try and forget.

13:52.744 --> 13:54.659
I'm sorry,
but from the look of things,

13:54.659 --> 13:56.226
that doesn't seem
to be working out.

13:56.226 --> 13:59.795
Yeah, well,
I'm not done trying.

13:59.795 --> 14:03.581
What if I told you
there was another way?

14:03.581 --> 14:08.891
If you help us, I can help you
forget all of it.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.026
How?

14:13.026 --> 14:14.766
Yeah, how?

14:17.682 --> 14:20.685
Now, to take out the Akrida,

14:20.685 --> 14:22.687
we must first kill the queen.

14:22.687 --> 14:23.732
Do you have anything
in that bag

14:23.732 --> 14:25.168
that's not of this world?

14:25.168 --> 14:26.604
Ah, so you've
already learned

14:26.604 --> 14:28.693
about that little loophole,
have you?

14:28.693 --> 14:32.262
Hunters, you continue to defy
my prejudices.

14:32.262 --> 14:34.351
So these stingers they use
to control people.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.266
Are not of this world.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.051
Now, by folding

14:38.051 --> 14:39.704
the cellular protein
of an Akrida

14:39.704 --> 14:41.706
into an abnormal protein--

14:41.706 --> 14:45.101
well, that's basically
a misfolded protein--

14:45.101 --> 14:47.799
I can produce a neurotoxin

14:47.799 --> 14:50.759
that will ravage
the queen's DNA.

14:50.759 --> 14:54.458
Oh, she'll suffer greatly
before dying.

14:57.505 --> 14:59.855
Okay.
So for this plan to work,

14:59.855 --> 15:01.857
you need the Akrida stingers.
- Mm-mm.

15:01.857 --> 15:03.815
No, the Akrida stingers
can't be removed

15:03.815 --> 15:05.643
without serious mental magic.

15:05.643 --> 15:09.386
Ah, well now, you see,
that's what I thought at first,

15:09.386 --> 15:12.737
but then I discovered that
if I make an incision

15:12.737 --> 15:16.045
in the basal ganglia,
similar to a craniotomy,

15:16.045 --> 15:21.007
the stingers
can then be safely removed.

15:21.007 --> 15:22.747
And the human host?

15:22.747 --> 15:25.576
Oh, back
to his or her normal life.

15:25.576 --> 15:28.275
Now, I can perform
the procedure,

15:28.275 --> 15:30.277
but I'm afraid I'll be
rather useless

15:30.277 --> 15:31.931
at procuring a subject.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.151
That's more...
- Dirty work.

15:35.151 --> 15:36.892
Hunter work.

15:36.892 --> 15:40.591
Crudely put,
but that's your nature.

15:40.591 --> 15:46.641
Now, what we need is
a human under Akrida control.

15:46.641 --> 15:48.034
We know a guy.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.309
<i>Dispatch for Officer Jones.
A motorist requires</i>

16:02.309 --> 16:05.181
<i>roadside assistance
out on Brookside Road.</i>

16:21.023 --> 16:23.721
What seems to be the problem?

16:23.721 --> 16:25.549
Took you long enough,
Officer Jones.

16:29.597 --> 16:31.033
Breaking into
police frequency

16:31.033 --> 16:32.948
could put you behind bars,
young lady.

16:32.948 --> 16:34.297
Too bad you're gonna die

16:34.297 --> 16:36.299
before I can even get
my cuffs on you.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.439
Hey, you'll thank us later, buddy.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.315
Thank you.

16:52.315 --> 16:54.100
Must they encase
all their foods

16:54.100 --> 16:55.579
in congealed oil?

16:55.579 --> 16:57.625
It's repulsive.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.019
But their ranch dressing...

17:00.019 --> 17:02.673
remind me to slather it
liberally over their corpses

17:02.673 --> 17:05.546
during invasion times.

17:05.546 --> 17:08.418
Which brings us
to the matter at hand.

17:08.418 --> 17:10.551
The Hunters.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.640
They were useful when we needed
them for monster essence,

17:12.640 --> 17:14.816
but now they're a problem.

17:14.816 --> 17:18.689
With that ink on their skin,
we can't even take them over.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.127
So why haven't we cracked
their skulls open?

17:21.127 --> 17:25.566
Because the queen thinks

17:25.566 --> 17:28.786
these pests
may still be useful.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.224
Namely, leading us
to this bastard.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.052
The queen believes
he's a Hunter himself,

17:33.052 --> 17:35.054
and by all accounts
from our spies in the field,

17:35.054 --> 17:38.187
he's the reason the Hunters'
merry band got together.

17:38.187 --> 17:41.190
He needs to be eliminated.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.627
But how?
We don't even know who he is.

17:43.627 --> 17:45.977
I have a plan.

17:45.977 --> 17:49.546
We just need to spill
a little human blood.

18:02.255 --> 18:04.779
No need to worry, my friends.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.912
The phenobarbital mixture
in this IV is my own creation.

18:07.912 --> 18:10.393
Strong enough to keep
a werewolf sleeping

18:10.393 --> 18:13.440
while a bone saw
cuts through its skull.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.224
Although the curveball
is if they start

18:15.224 --> 18:17.879
to transform mid-surgery.
Now, that is...

18:17.879 --> 18:19.141
So we're safe.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.926
Oh, indeed.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.667
It's incredible.

18:23.667 --> 18:27.976
So close to finishing my work
after all these years.

18:27.976 --> 18:33.416
Finally paying back those bugs
for what they took from me.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.592
- What did they take from you?
- Hmm?

18:35.592 --> 18:40.336
Oh, well, from all of us.

18:40.336 --> 18:41.642
If you'll excuse me,

18:41.642 --> 18:42.991
there's just a few last items

18:42.991 --> 18:45.124
I need to fetch
from the atrium.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.651
All right,
what was that about?

18:50.651 --> 18:52.261
I'm getting the impression

18:52.261 --> 18:55.003
this is personal for him
in a way he hasn't shared.

18:55.003 --> 18:57.048
Something is off
about this guy.

18:57.048 --> 18:58.659
Didn't he say
that he didn't have a family?

18:58.659 --> 19:00.226
Yeah, why?

19:00.226 --> 19:03.185
There's an indentation
where the ring should be.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.883
You know, some of the older
married guys in 'Nam,

19:05.883 --> 19:09.060
they used to keep their wedding
rings with their dog tags.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.627
They all had the same mark
on their finger.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.587
So what else
is he lying to us about?

19:15.502 --> 19:17.547
All right.

19:17.547 --> 19:18.766
This is it.

19:21.769 --> 19:25.555
Everything in
my emergency stash.

19:25.555 --> 19:27.688
Now, when are you gonna tell me
what the vein juice is for?

19:27.688 --> 19:30.256
It's for a ceremony
involving blood magic.

19:30.256 --> 19:32.432
It's how we're gonna get
Roxy to remember,

19:32.432 --> 19:34.521
then forget,
her Akrida memories.

19:34.521 --> 19:36.914
Aren't spells
usually Ada's thing?

19:36.914 --> 19:39.439
I mean, did she teach you
how to do any of this?

19:39.439 --> 19:42.137
Close, but no.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.748
Tony did.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.228
Tony?

19:46.228 --> 19:48.752
You mean your crush Tony.
That Tony?

19:48.752 --> 19:51.146
I mean, how? I thought he was
gone and off the grid.

19:51.146 --> 19:54.236
Oh, you dirty, dozing tramp.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.630
Have you been seeing him
in your dreams?

19:56.630 --> 20:00.721
Yes, but it's not
what you think.

20:00.721 --> 20:03.463
Mostly not.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.639
He's been educating me.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.251
Oh, I am sure he has.

20:09.251 --> 20:10.687
Spill.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.907
He's been using
his knowledge as a djinn

20:12.907 --> 20:14.256
to teach me a technique

20:14.256 --> 20:16.954
to induce a type
of meditative state.

20:16.954 --> 20:19.783
Teach me a meditative state.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.046
Like magical hypnosis

20:22.046 --> 20:25.528
allowing a person to access
their buried memories.

20:25.528 --> 20:26.921
It works in two parts.

20:26.921 --> 20:29.750
First, we excavate
Roxy's memories,

20:29.750 --> 20:32.709
then two, we erase them.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.711
At least, that's the hope.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.713
Never actually done this before.

20:39.890 --> 20:43.285
Wiped down my arms
like you asked.

20:43.285 --> 20:46.941
So before I chicken out,
let's do this.

20:46.941 --> 20:50.988
Take a breath.
Deep and slow.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.872
Okay.

21:04.872 --> 21:06.874
Now, I want you
to think back, Roxy,

21:06.874 --> 21:08.179
all the way
to when your memories

21:08.179 --> 21:10.399
first became fractured.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.183
What do you see?

21:12.183 --> 21:15.143
It's late.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.972
After work.

21:17.972 --> 21:21.323
I'm walking to my car.

21:21.323 --> 21:25.893
Wait. There's something moving
in the dark.

21:25.893 --> 21:28.374
It's...

21:28.374 --> 21:30.811
Roxy, what is it?

21:30.811 --> 21:33.814
I won't let you do it again.

21:33.814 --> 21:36.817
- Lata.
- Monster.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.907
All right, stand back.
I'll handle her.

21:39.907 --> 21:43.954
No, don't. It's working.

21:49.873 --> 21:53.834
I feel it... on me.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.489
It's burrowing inside.

22:01.711 --> 22:03.496
It's here.

22:05.628 --> 22:08.457
It's taking my arms.

22:08.457 --> 22:11.330
My body.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.289
My voice.

22:14.289 --> 22:17.814
I tried to scream,
but I'm not here anymore.

22:20.251 --> 22:22.950
I'm not anywhere.

22:22.950 --> 22:26.780
Hey, hey.

22:26.780 --> 22:29.565
Do you feel that?

22:29.565 --> 22:32.481
Yeah? Then you are right here.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.265
You are not trapped
in your memories.

22:34.265 --> 22:38.792
You are choosing to be brave
and fight back.

22:38.792 --> 22:42.491
These monsters we're hunting,
they have a leader.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.972
We need to find out
where she's hiding

22:44.972 --> 22:48.105
in order to defeat them.

22:48.105 --> 22:50.456
Can you tell us where?

22:54.068 --> 22:55.896
The queen...

22:55.896 --> 22:57.811
she's underground.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.596
Where underground?

23:02.990 --> 23:04.644
Wait a second.

23:04.644 --> 23:08.430
Didn't Porter say he built
the laboratory himself?

23:08.430 --> 23:10.824
'Cause here, it says credit
for the lab construction

23:10.824 --> 23:14.131
goes to his assistant,
a guy named Jack Wilcox.

23:14.131 --> 23:17.134
Well, there's got to be
a file on him.

23:17.134 --> 23:21.095
Wilcox. Here we go.

23:21.095 --> 23:24.315
Jack Wilcox, assistant
to a Porter J. Hobbes,

23:24.315 --> 23:26.753
born in Biloxi, Mississippi,
married to a...

23:26.753 --> 23:28.929
Dorothea Wilcox.

23:28.929 --> 23:31.235
Jack oversaw every aspect
of building the medical lab

23:31.235 --> 23:32.672
and received
special recognition

23:32.672 --> 23:34.282
for following through
with his motto.

23:34.282 --> 23:35.892
"Everything in its place."

23:39.418 --> 23:42.246
It said he was kicked out
of the Men of Letters

23:42.246 --> 23:45.336
for experimenting on humans.

23:45.336 --> 23:48.644
And look at the name of the guy
who reported him.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.832
Come in.

24:02.832 --> 24:04.617
Just finishing up
the last piece

24:04.617 --> 24:07.054
I need before the surgery.

24:07.054 --> 24:09.578
It takes a lot to keep
these Akrida subdued.

24:09.578 --> 24:13.234
I'm sure.
You know, Mary and I...

24:13.234 --> 24:15.932
we're really impressed.
- Yeah.

24:15.932 --> 24:18.979
Your photo should be on the
Men of Letters hall of fame.

24:18.979 --> 24:22.069
Clearly Porter J. Hobbes was
the brains of this outfit.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.813
Well, you can rest assured,

24:26.813 --> 24:31.078
it was a team effort
back in the day...

24:31.078 --> 24:34.255
just as it is today.

24:34.255 --> 24:35.952
Who else was on the team?

24:35.952 --> 24:39.826
Oh, I had an assistant.

24:39.826 --> 24:43.351
Charming young man.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.572
Actually, it was he
who came up with a solution

24:46.572 --> 24:49.400
that knocked out
Akrida-controlled humans.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.751
I thought you said you came
up with that concoction.

24:55.276 --> 24:58.714
You are so very like
your father, aren't you, John?

25:13.642 --> 25:16.166
Well...

25:16.166 --> 25:17.559
Guess I can drop

25:17.559 --> 25:20.954
that phony accent now.

25:20.954 --> 25:22.956
Don't you worry.

25:22.956 --> 25:25.393
It'll all be over soon.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.709
Found something.
A location in Kansas

25:36.709 --> 25:39.886
a couple of hours away
matching Roxy's description.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.757
Huh. Nicely done.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.716
I guess research
is just another arrow

25:43.716 --> 25:46.762
in my quiver of talents.

25:46.762 --> 25:49.243
Hey, gently now.

25:49.243 --> 25:52.333
You just relived months
of traumatic memories.

25:52.333 --> 25:55.597
Yeah, about that.

25:55.597 --> 25:58.600
Why do I still
remember everything?

25:58.600 --> 26:02.604
And worse, like it happened
five minutes ago.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.738
Two-step process, I'm afraid.

26:05.738 --> 26:09.568
First is excavation,
then erasure.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.092
It's too dangerous to keep you
down for the whole thing,

26:12.092 --> 26:15.312
but just relax while
I prepare the next step.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.056
In the meantime,

26:20.056 --> 26:22.972
could I offer you
some of my come-down tea?

26:22.972 --> 26:25.279
I've got all the fixings
in my van.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.979
Hey.

26:29.979 --> 26:32.678
It's gonna be okay.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.594
I know it is.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.861
I don't want you
to make me forget.

26:44.951 --> 26:47.693
Wait, you don't want to erase

26:47.693 --> 26:49.608
this hellish ordeal
from your brain?

26:49.608 --> 26:51.218
You guys have a plan
to take down

26:51.218 --> 26:52.828
these Akrida bastards, right?

26:52.828 --> 26:55.135
- We're gonna try.
- They're as sure as dead.

26:57.485 --> 27:00.531
Then I want to remember.

27:00.531 --> 27:04.405
I want to remember
that I helped you.

27:04.405 --> 27:06.712
I want to know
that my memories helped knock

27:06.712 --> 27:09.628
these bugs back to wherever
the hell they're from.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.462
Time to dry out.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.034
Oh, let's not throw
the bourbon out

27:25.034 --> 27:26.949
with the bathwater, shall we?

27:31.171 --> 27:33.739
Roxy?

27:33.739 --> 27:36.611
Thank you for helping us.

27:40.920 --> 27:43.357
Oh, one more thing.

27:43.357 --> 27:45.185
If there's a chance
to sucker-punch

27:45.185 --> 27:48.579
this queen of theirs, call me.

28:10.079 --> 28:12.691
Mary. Mary.

28:14.475 --> 28:17.652
Where is she?
- Prepped for surgery.

28:17.652 --> 28:19.088
The hell are you
talking about?

28:19.088 --> 28:22.178
Well now, you and Mary
have a big part

28:22.178 --> 28:24.920
to play
in tonight's excitement.

28:24.920 --> 28:31.013
But I knew I had to catch
the two of you alone,

28:31.013 --> 28:34.756
and when your friends took off
in the hippie wagon,

28:34.756 --> 28:37.628
I said to myself,
"Well, Jack, old boy,

28:37.628 --> 28:39.152
here's your chance."

28:39.152 --> 28:42.764
So you're plan
with the policeman--

28:42.764 --> 28:44.505
that was just BS
to get us to buy it.

28:44.505 --> 28:47.769
Oh, I yanked all them three

28:47.769 --> 28:51.555
Akrida stingers
from your policeman friend.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.080
Well, sadly, I was wrong

28:54.080 --> 28:56.560
about his ability
to survive the process.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.301
You're insane.

28:58.301 --> 29:00.782
Now, there you go.

29:00.782 --> 29:06.309
Finally, you sound
like a Men of Letters.

29:06.309 --> 29:10.009
Just like how I told
your father all them years ago.

29:10.009 --> 29:12.272
We're in a war, son.

29:12.272 --> 29:14.448
Time is short.

29:14.448 --> 29:18.495
We need to exploit
every option available.

29:24.458 --> 29:27.200
Well, Mary is prepped
for her procedure.

29:27.200 --> 29:30.116
Oh, but hey, if you feel
like you're missing out,

29:30.116 --> 29:32.466
rest easy.

29:32.466 --> 29:34.468
It'll be your turn next.

29:34.468 --> 29:35.774
What procedure?

29:35.774 --> 29:38.167
Hey! Hey, what procedure?

30:08.589 --> 30:10.721
Rise and shine, sweetheart.

30:10.721 --> 30:12.506
What the hell?

30:12.506 --> 30:16.336
Ms. Campbell, I'd like you
to meet my wife, Dorothea.

30:16.336 --> 30:18.338
What did you do to her?

30:18.338 --> 30:21.036
Hmm?
Oh, I did nothing to her.

30:21.036 --> 30:23.865
The Akrida did this.

30:23.865 --> 30:26.955
Now you see,
shortly after I was booted

30:26.955 --> 30:30.219
from the Men of Letters,
the Akrida targeted me.

30:30.219 --> 30:31.786
Didn't take too kindly to me

30:31.786 --> 30:34.223
poking around
in their business.

30:34.223 --> 30:37.618
They couldn't touch me,
you see, as I was warded,

30:37.618 --> 30:40.229
same as y'all, so--

30:40.229 --> 30:43.580
so they came after my Dorothea.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.931
They left her in a coma.

30:45.931 --> 30:51.023
The doctors wanted
to take her off life support.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.764
I brought her home.

30:53.764 --> 30:57.638
Cast a spell on her to keep her
in this suspended state.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.031
Why is she here?

30:59.031 --> 31:01.250
Well, it's time
to wake her up,

31:01.250 --> 31:05.080
finally put these stingers
to their proper use.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.996
You never were gonna help us
defeat the Akrida, were you?

31:07.996 --> 31:11.173
Now, Ms. Campbell,
there is nothing I want more

31:11.173 --> 31:15.351
than the total and utter
destruction of the Akrida.

31:15.351 --> 31:19.660
But there's no world worth
saving without her in it.

31:19.660 --> 31:23.403
Now, these stingers
are capable of transmitting

31:23.403 --> 31:28.582
one being's consciousness
into another's body.

31:28.582 --> 31:31.280
A single stinger
with the right modifications

31:31.280 --> 31:34.980
can help a woman
held prisoner in her own body

31:34.980 --> 31:41.073
to wake up in a new
and healthy host.

31:41.073 --> 31:42.813
Me.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.546
Oh, sounds like young
Winchester has met my golem.

32:19.546 --> 32:21.809
- You have a golem?
- I control it

32:21.809 --> 32:25.160
via a scroll secured
inside its mouth,

32:25.160 --> 32:27.597
but then, hey, I guess
you know about that.

32:27.597 --> 32:29.251
I know John's
gonna beat its ass.

32:29.251 --> 32:33.908
Well, now, I wouldn't be
so sure about that.

32:33.908 --> 32:39.131
That was my spleen.

32:39.131 --> 32:42.177
You must work for Porter, right?

32:44.745 --> 32:46.834
Okay, look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.705
Jack, my mistake.

32:48.705 --> 32:49.968
Look, your boss,
he probably wouldn't want

32:49.968 --> 32:51.621
a big mess, right?

32:51.621 --> 32:54.711
So why don't we just call it
a draw?

33:05.722 --> 33:07.333
Whoa.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.639
My golem is
under strict orders

33:09.639 --> 33:11.076
not to kill John.

33:11.076 --> 33:15.428
No, I need his body intact
for my transfer.

33:18.083 --> 33:21.303
Well, it's not gonna be
a long honeymoon for you kids,

33:21.303 --> 33:22.957
the end of the world
coming and all.

33:22.957 --> 33:26.004
My new body, armed
with decades of research?

33:26.004 --> 33:28.702
Oh, Dorothea and I
will finally get our revenge,

33:28.702 --> 33:32.445
end this war, and then
we'll finally be able to live

33:32.445 --> 33:35.448
the long and healthy life
we were robbed of.

33:35.448 --> 33:38.581
By robbing us of our lives.
How romantic.

33:38.581 --> 33:42.194
Wait. Well, you think
you're gonna die.

33:42.194 --> 33:44.152
Oh, no, no, no.

33:44.152 --> 33:47.503
No, Dorothea and I may be
getting into the driver's seat,

33:47.503 --> 33:51.768
but your consciousness is
coming along for the ride.

33:51.768 --> 33:57.122
Your love will live on in us.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.044
You have to get the scroll
in the golem's mouth.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.002
- The what?
- The scroll.

34:15.444 --> 34:17.272
You have to get the scroll
from its mouth.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.752
It freezes it.
You have to get it out.

34:18.752 --> 34:21.885
It's the only way.

34:21.885 --> 34:23.713
Oh, that's gonna be
a little difficult.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.411
Kill him!

34:32.157 --> 34:33.201
Mary.

34:45.779 --> 34:47.650
Dorothea, no.

34:47.650 --> 34:49.696
Dorothea. Dorothea.

35:06.321 --> 35:07.714
Oh, wait. Wait.

35:27.037 --> 35:28.604
What the--

35:32.652 --> 35:33.914
Wait. Wait.

35:40.050 --> 35:43.837
No, no! No.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.905
All right.

36:08.905 --> 36:11.821
Salted, burned, and buried.

36:11.821 --> 36:14.563
Too bad you couldn't put this
in your essay to KSU, huh?

36:18.263 --> 36:22.049
So Porter, or Jack,

36:22.049 --> 36:24.051
did all that just
to resurrect his wife.

36:24.051 --> 36:29.230
He gave up everything, all
so he wouldn't lose Dorothea.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.927
Things we do for love.

36:33.321 --> 36:36.324
- It's not love.
- What do you mean?

36:36.324 --> 36:39.109
Jack was only thinking
of himself,

36:39.109 --> 36:41.851
of what he wanted.

36:41.851 --> 36:44.724
It didn't matter if it cost him
his humanity to get it.

36:49.076 --> 36:53.211
That'll never be us, right?

36:53.211 --> 36:54.516
Never.

37:10.271 --> 37:11.272
Whoop.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.768
<i>You know, how could you
hold out on me like that?</i>

37:28.768 --> 37:31.553
And not just about
your dream tryst with Tony,

37:31.553 --> 37:34.948
but also this whole thing about
your memory-erasing abilities.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.037
In my hour of need.

37:37.037 --> 37:39.866
Carlos, you're not seriously

37:39.866 --> 37:41.824
asking me to erase Anton,
are you?

37:41.824 --> 37:44.305
You're saying you'd help
Roxy, but not me.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.960
No, because giving
your fear of intimacy

37:46.960 --> 37:49.876
a "get out of jail free" card
does not count as help.

37:52.574 --> 37:55.316
Okay.

37:55.316 --> 37:59.059
Honest truth?

37:59.059 --> 38:03.498
If I'd known you could before,
I probably would've asked.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.066
But seeing Roxy choose

38:06.066 --> 38:07.807
to live with her memories
of the Akrida

38:07.807 --> 38:09.765
and hearing her say

38:09.765 --> 38:14.292
she'd be okay in spite of it
made me realize that

38:14.292 --> 38:17.643
sometimes the things
you want to forget

38:17.643 --> 38:21.211
are probably
the things you shouldn't.

38:21.211 --> 38:25.868
And for me that's Anton.

38:27.566 --> 38:31.439
And his beautiful, round,
dimpled pancake face.

38:49.152 --> 38:53.374
Bricks, construction equipment,
just like Roxy said.

38:53.374 --> 38:56.246
I mean, it looks
like an abandoned warehouse.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.423
Well, obviously.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.600
But how do we know
if the queen is in there?

39:03.384 --> 39:05.038
Wait.

39:21.446 --> 39:26.625
Hold on.
Oh, that tragic haircut.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.496
The woman from the lab.

39:28.496 --> 39:30.368
The Akrida-controlled human

39:30.368 --> 39:32.544
who was collecting
the monster essence.

39:32.544 --> 39:36.852
Roxy was right.
I mean, this is it.

39:36.852 --> 39:40.160
We found the Akrida queen.

39:56.872 --> 40:01.181
- Kyle?
- Late night, Winchester?

40:01.181 --> 40:03.401
How'd you get in here?

40:03.401 --> 40:06.186
Been meaning to talk to you
about this whole Mary thing.

40:06.186 --> 40:08.188
- What do you mean?
- I can see you're not much

40:08.188 --> 40:10.103
of a critical thinker,
so let me lay it out for you.

40:10.103 --> 40:11.757
You don't know it yet,

40:11.757 --> 40:14.324
but we're about to get
in a big fight about Mary.

40:14.324 --> 40:15.761
You may have won the girl,

40:15.761 --> 40:17.240
but it wasn't enough for you,
was it?

40:17.240 --> 40:20.287
You just had to keep
coming after me.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.289
- Have you been drinking?
- No.

40:22.289 --> 40:25.466
Clearheaded enough to have
already called the cops.

40:25.466 --> 40:28.643
"Oh, God. Please come save me.

40:28.643 --> 40:31.646
"John Winchester's
trying to kill me.

40:31.646 --> 40:37.086
Come to his mommy's garage
as soon as you can."

40:37.086 --> 40:39.175
How long have you been
controlling Kyle?

40:39.175 --> 40:42.178
Long enough to leave a bunch
of sad little journal entries

40:42.178 --> 40:46.008
in his diary about
how you've been harassing him.

40:46.008 --> 40:50.360
That angry streak of yours.
That's right.

40:50.360 --> 40:52.014
I've heard the stories,

40:52.014 --> 40:55.583
and I've seen the file
the cops have on you.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.629
What do the Akrida want
with Kyle?

40:57.629 --> 40:58.978
Nothing.

40:58.978 --> 41:03.243
He's just a means
to an end, to you.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.767
Easy.

41:05.767 --> 41:08.857
This pretty little one's
seen a lot of action, huh?

41:08.857 --> 41:10.424
We've been watching.

41:10.424 --> 41:13.166
You're just a killing machine,
aren't you?

41:13.166 --> 41:16.038
No!

41:16.038 --> 41:19.607
Don't worry.
I don't feel a thing.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.740
Please don't do this.

41:21.740 --> 41:23.350
Hey, please.

41:23.350 --> 41:28.050
I'll see you again real soon, Winchester.

41:28.050 --> 41:32.054
No. No, stop.

41:32.054 --> 41:37.625
Come on. Stay with me.
Come on.

41:37.625 --> 41:41.020
Come on, Kyle. Help.
