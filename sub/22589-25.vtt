<i>Four hundred thousand people...</i>

00:52.387 --> 00:55.098
Make one false move...

00:56.099 --> 00:59.018
...you got another mouth
where your nose used to be.

00:59.227 --> 01:02.981
Keep the grubby hands
towards the sky, fellas.

01:09.404 --> 01:13.825
All right, let's burn the breeze
and hightail it out of here.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.211
Who was that man?

01:25.420 --> 01:28.172
I'm not quite sure,
but he left this platinum bullet.

01:28.381 --> 01:32.802
Platinum bullet?
Only one man uses a platinum bullet.

01:33.011 --> 01:34.512
You mean...?

01:34.971 --> 01:36.639
No doubt about it, Chief O'Hara.

01:36.848 --> 01:40.852
Shame has come back to taunt us
with his Western wiliness. Ha.

01:41.060 --> 01:45.356
What a frightening felony, rustling
the most expensive automobile in racing.

01:45.565 --> 01:47.275
You heard about the other robberies?

01:47.483 --> 01:50.028
The hot rod and the go-cart?
Yes, I know about them.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.071
However, they were simple car thefts...

01:52.280 --> 01:55.783
...so handled easy enough
by our department. But this? Ha, ha.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.953
This sheds an entirely new light
on the affair.

01:59.162 --> 02:01.289
You think Shame stole them too?

02:01.497 --> 02:03.291
No doubt about it.

02:03.499 --> 02:07.503
Only one man
would have the unmitigated gall...

02:07.712 --> 02:12.342
...to pilfer an automobile and have it witnessed
by more than 800,000 eyes.

02:12.550 --> 02:16.220
- What do we do now, commissioner?
-What do we do?

02:17.138 --> 02:19.265
What can we do?

02:19.849 --> 02:22.602
You know as well as I
that this can only be handled...

02:22.810 --> 02:25.355
...by one far wiser than we.

02:25.563 --> 02:28.232
<i>And in stately Wayne Manor...</i>

02:38.826 --> 02:41.746
Bruce, that's wonderful, so exciting.

02:41.954 --> 02:46.125
The trick is to make the cars go slow so
they don't fall off the track on the curves.

02:46.334 --> 02:48.753
It's child's play once you get the hang of it.

02:48.961 --> 02:52.590
I guess I still haven't gotten it.
That's three in a row you've beaten me.

02:52.799 --> 02:57.053
Makes no difference if you win or lose.
It's how you play the game.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.013
It's easier to say that when you win.

02:59.639 --> 03:02.225
- Ahem, sir?
- Yes, Alfred.

03:02.433 --> 03:06.312
You have an appointment
with a Mr. Red Amici, sir.

03:06.521 --> 03:09.315
- Man from the phone company?
-One and the same, Master Dick.

03:09.524 --> 03:11.359
- Golly.
-Can't keep him waiting, can we?

03:11.567 --> 03:13.361
- No, sir.
-Why don't you try it, Aunt Harriet?

03:16.197 --> 03:20.326
Now, what was it he said
about not falling off the track?

03:23.746 --> 03:26.124
- Yes, commissioner?
-There were three auto thefts...

03:26.332 --> 03:27.542
...in Gotham City today.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.044
That should be simple enough
for your fine force.

03:30.253 --> 03:34.465
It would be, except that all clues point
to the redoubtable road agent.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.176
The bloodthirsty bushwhacker.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.803
Shame himself.

03:39.345 --> 03:40.596
We'll be right there.

03:40.805 --> 03:42.682
To the Batpoles.

05:17.193 --> 05:22.448
The nerve of some of these criminals
never ceases to astound me, Batman.

05:22.657 --> 05:24.325
Shame never was one for modesty.

05:24.534 --> 05:30.289
All of his crimes have a certain flair,
a certain bravado.

05:30.498 --> 05:33.960
Not unlike the Western criminals
of yesteryear.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.879
And you say those three stray cars
were rounded up?

05:37.088 --> 05:39.131
That's right, Caped Crimebuster...

05:39.340 --> 05:42.885
...but there's something downright devilish
about the whole thing.

05:43.052 --> 05:44.428
What is that, Chief O'Hara?

05:44.637 --> 05:49.517
Well, instead of rustling the entire car,
he took just one item from each of them...

05:49.725 --> 05:51.769
...then abandoned the rest
of the automobile.

05:51.978 --> 05:53.771
Holy jigsaw puzzles.

05:53.980 --> 05:57.233
He purloined the 28-barrel carburetor
from Grimaldi Smith's racer.

05:57.441 --> 06:01.445
Some custom-made alloy pistons
from the engine of the go-cart.

06:01.654 --> 06:03.489
And some milled heads from a hot rod.

06:03.698 --> 06:07.660
Why would anyone just steal bits and pieces
of cars rather than one entire auto?

06:07.869 --> 06:09.203
That is the question.

06:09.412 --> 06:13.207
And he left this platinum bullet behind.

06:13.749 --> 06:16.669
Platinum is not easy to come by these days.

06:16.878 --> 06:19.630
Perhaps we can trace it
on our Precious Metals Bat-Analyzer.

06:19.839 --> 06:22.508
Let's go, Robin. We've nary a second to lose.
Vamonos.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.302
Right, amigo.

06:24.510 --> 06:26.637
- Feel better, O'Hara?
-Much.

06:26.804 --> 06:28.973
Ha-ha-ha. So do I.

06:31.934 --> 06:34.395
<i>NARRATOR".
Meanwhile, in Westernland...</i>

06:34.604 --> 06:39.650
<i>...a deserted and bankrupt movie studio
on the edge of Gotham City...</i>

06:39.817 --> 06:43.029
<i>...Shame has another ax to grind.</i>

06:51.662 --> 06:53.205
Good.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.459
When I lay my paws on Batman and Robin...

06:56.667 --> 06:59.211
...I'm gonna crease their skulls
so hard with this...

06:59.378 --> 07:02.006
...they'll be known
as the Dynamic Foursome.

07:02.214 --> 07:03.424
Good idea.

07:03.633 --> 07:07.970
I'm gonna pour me three fingers
of this here tonsil varnish.

07:13.935 --> 07:17.647
I reckon that's why
they call me Messy James, huh?

07:22.777 --> 07:26.656
Okie Annie, quit pounding your fingers
and get over here.

07:34.205 --> 07:38.209
Shame, how much longer you reckon before
this here truck's ready to roam in the range?

07:38.417 --> 07:39.835
Soon enough, dumpling.

07:40.044 --> 07:43.589
Just as soon as I get the rest of the making
for that there motor.

07:43.923 --> 07:48.761
And when I do, this here truck's
gonna go 300 miles per...

07:49.303 --> 07:50.888
- Day?
-Hour!

07:51.514 --> 07:55.267
Last time I was in Gotham City,
that goldarn Batmobile...

07:55.476 --> 07:59.313
...followed me all over,
finally cut me off at a concrete pass.

07:59.522 --> 08:02.566
Caused me to spend quite
a spell up the river.

08:02.775 --> 08:05.277
Well, I don't aim
to have that happen no more.

08:05.486 --> 08:06.654
Shame, honey...

08:06.862 --> 08:10.700
...it ain't so much the car,
it's the fellas what drive it.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.785
Good.

08:13.285 --> 08:17.415
If all goes well, them two
will be pushing up daisies pretty soon.

08:17.623 --> 08:20.126
But just in case they ain't,
I want that there truck...

08:20.334 --> 08:24.547
...to make that there Batmobile
look like a turtle with arthritis.

08:24.755 --> 08:27.466
When you've got plans as big as mine,
babyâ€œ.

08:27.675 --> 08:30.428
...you gotta cover all the angles.

08:30.636 --> 08:32.596
And the biggest angle of all...

08:32.804 --> 08:35.390
...is a clean, quick getaway.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.351
Hey, someone's a-coming!

08:38.184 --> 08:39.812
Get away.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.252
Howdy, barkeep.

09:03.461 --> 09:05.796
My handle's Andy Stevens.

09:06.005 --> 09:08.758
Perhaps you've heard of me,
the Pecos Kid?

09:08.966 --> 09:11.302
I got 12 notches on my gun...

09:11.719 --> 09:14.221
...and they ain't there
because I like whittling.

09:14.430 --> 09:16.223
If you get what I mean.

09:16.432 --> 09:21.729
Let me have some of your best red eye
and leave the bottle.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.064
Yes, sir.

09:23.272 --> 09:26.108
Mommy!

09:30.112 --> 09:33.449
Just as I suspected, Robin.

09:33.657 --> 09:38.412
An ordinary lead bullet
coated with platinum paint.

09:38.621 --> 09:40.039
It's no help at all.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.458
Let's try another tack.

09:42.666 --> 09:47.171
Shame has stolen a carburetor,
pistons and milled heads.

09:47.379 --> 09:50.591
- Now, what does that suggest to you, Robin?
-He's building an engine.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.636
Why go to all this trouble
when it's less dangerous to buy one?

09:53.803 --> 09:55.930
Why, indeed, Robin.

09:56.138 --> 10:00.017
However, these are not ordinary
automotive components.

10:00.226 --> 10:01.977
They're highly sophisticated...

10:02.186 --> 10:04.980
...not readily available at your local garage.

10:05.189 --> 10:09.527
- No. There's a method to his misdemeanors.
-I've got it.

10:09.735 --> 10:12.613
He wants to enter in the Gotham City
Grand Prix next month...

10:12.822 --> 10:14.740
...for the $100,000 prize.

10:14.949 --> 10:16.242
Good thinking, old chum.

10:16.450 --> 10:20.246
Now, if you were building a super engine,
what else would you need?

10:20.454 --> 10:23.958
- A special camshaft and valve lifters.
-Precisely.

10:24.166 --> 10:27.294
I think this calls for a clever ruse.

10:31.507 --> 10:32.633
Such as?

10:32.842 --> 10:36.053
Hot Rod Harry,
dean of Gotham City's disc jockeys...

10:36.262 --> 10:40.182
...the man who knows all there is to know
about cars.

10:40.474 --> 10:44.728
Please, get me radio station KGC.

10:45.062 --> 10:47.565
Yes, siree, baby.
We play the pick of the pack...

10:47.773 --> 10:49.400
...the best in wax and shellac...

10:49.608 --> 10:52.278
...for all you guys and gals out there
in radioland.

10:52.486 --> 10:55.781
Let's move right along now
with a tune that was written this morning...

10:55.990 --> 10:58.242
...and already it's number three.
Do you hear me?

10:58.450 --> 11:01.537
On the KGC survey here
in Gotham City's ville.

11:01.745 --> 11:06.167
It's "Desert Sands"
by Lawrence and the Arabians.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.423
Hot Rod Harry, your musical maestro.

11:12.631 --> 11:15.342
- Hello, Harry, this is Bruce Wayne.
- Hi, Brucey, <i>baby.</i>

11:15.551 --> 11:18.679
<i>Hey, you're the fellow
that endowed the drag strip in the suburbs.</i>

11:18.888 --> 11:20.264
<i>Keep the kids off the streets.</i>

11:20.472 --> 11:23.475
That's right, Harry.
Could you do me a small favor?

11:23.684 --> 11:24.977
A radio announcement.

11:25.186 --> 11:28.606
Cool daddy. Ha, ha. And that's from the guy
who's saying yes...

11:28.814 --> 11:31.525
...who makes the top decisions
and plays the tops and pops.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.527
And also some of the old-time tunes...

11:33.736 --> 11:36.238
...right here on KGC,
number one radio in Gotham City.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.837
Say, that's right good, Mr. Shame...

11:52.046 --> 11:55.591
...but how come you only use one gun
while the rest of your friends have two?

11:56.008 --> 12:00.012
A fella only needs one gun, Andy,
if he knows how to use it proper.

12:00.221 --> 12:04.183
Golly, you're pretty handy
with that peacemaker, mighty fast.

12:04.558 --> 12:10.481
Well, partner, a fella had to be handy
with a six-gun where I came from.

12:10.689 --> 12:15.194
Boot Hill was filled with fellas
who pull the trigger before they took aim.

12:15.694 --> 12:18.530
Many a buckaroo took the long jump...

12:18.906 --> 12:20.282
...because he had a case of slow.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.785
<i>Hey, all you chicks and chucks out there.</i>

12:22.993 --> 12:26.830
<i>You all remember Brucey Wayne, the cat
came up with the scratch for the drag strip?</i>

12:27.039 --> 12:29.124
<i>Well, he just had his limousine
all revamped.</i>

12:29.333 --> 12:32.169
<i>That's what I said,
had the man put on a hand-made camshaft...</i>

12:32.378 --> 12:35.965
<i>...and some special imported
new valve lifters. Now, that's real class.</i>

12:36.173 --> 12:38.926
<i>He'll be showing the car next week
at the auto show.</i>

12:39.134 --> 12:41.595
So <i>all you Johns and Janes
kind of fall by, huh?</i>

12:41.804 --> 12:47.268
<i>I hear it makes that car go
298 miles an hour. Wow!</i>

12:47.476 --> 12:51.814
Hey, that's what we need
to finish off that there stallion.

12:52.022 --> 12:55.067
- What now, boss?
-Okie Annie...

12:55.276 --> 12:57.903
...you gotta bushwhack
this here Wayne fellow...

12:58.112 --> 12:59.613
...and get his cayuse.
-Do tell.

12:59.822 --> 13:03.075
Little Shorthorn,
we're gonna have to hit the trail now.

13:03.284 --> 13:07.162
I'm gonna borrow that radio from you
because I gotta hear that disc jockey fella...

13:07.371 --> 13:09.540
...and get some more of them hot rod tips.

13:09.748 --> 13:14.169
All right, amigos. Let's go.

13:19.258 --> 13:22.511
Hey, wait a minute! Come back, Shame!

13:22.720 --> 13:24.346
Come back, Shame!

13:24.555 --> 13:26.557
Shame, come back!

13:26.765 --> 13:29.685
Boy, I sure hope Shame bites the bait.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.437
Bait, Master Dick?

13:31.645 --> 13:34.148
I'm hoping the house is being watched
this very moment.

13:34.356 --> 13:36.150
Expect to be held up within the hour.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.485
My word, isn't that rather dangerous, sir?

13:38.694 --> 13:40.779
It's our only hope of catching Shame.

13:40.988 --> 13:44.575
All other clues have been exhausted.
Let's go, Dick.

13:46.410 --> 13:48.537
There they go.

13:49.038 --> 13:52.082
We'll follow and then strike
while the branding iron is still hot.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.335
You gonna kill them, boss?

13:54.543 --> 13:56.795
Only if they give me any backwash.

13:57.004 --> 14:01.216
One millionaire more or less
ain't gonna be missed by nobody.

14:08.932 --> 14:12.978
Gosh, Bruce, uh, I've never been in a place
like this before.

14:14.355 --> 14:18.692
Maybe we should have checked Aunt Harriet's
shopping list closely before we volunteered.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.445
- What do you think we should do?
-Press on.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.116
May I help you?

14:26.325 --> 14:30.204
Yes, we're looking for something in, uh--

14:30.746 --> 14:32.790
Uh, eh-- Uh, something in lingerie.

14:32.998 --> 14:37.002
I see. Exactly what sort of lingerie?

14:37.211 --> 14:41.048
Well, it's, um-- I-- I think one would--
How would you say it, Dick?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.634
Well, it's like-- It's--

14:43.842 --> 14:47.930
He wants a full slip, size 38,
white and washable.

14:49.431 --> 14:50.516
Yes.

14:51.433 --> 14:53.352
Well, thank you, Miss...?

14:53.560 --> 14:56.397
- Okie Annie.
-Miss Annie.

14:57.773 --> 15:00.150
Aren't you millionaire, Bruce Wayne?

15:00.359 --> 15:03.445
And aren't you
his youthful ward, Dick Grayson?

15:03.654 --> 15:04.696
How did you know?

15:04.905 --> 15:08.409
Well, I've seen your picture in the paper
a whole passel of times.

15:08.617 --> 15:10.327
And I could use your help.

15:10.536 --> 15:12.538
Turnabout is fair play. What do you need?

15:12.746 --> 15:15.541
My car is down in the parking lot
just plumb tuckered out...

15:15.749 --> 15:18.293
...and I'm down to my last chip.
-Mm-hm.

15:21.755 --> 15:26.802
- Do you need some money?
- No. No, just a lift over to Pointview Street.

15:27.010 --> 15:31.432
I mean, I couldn't ask just anyone, but
I reckon on account of you're so trustworthy...

15:31.640 --> 15:35.602
...because of the nice things I read in the paper
about what your foundation does.

15:35.811 --> 15:37.521
We can arrange that, can't we, Dick?

15:37.729 --> 15:39.565
- We sure can.
-I could kiss you for that.

15:39.773 --> 15:43.902
Oh, here, hold this. Come on, let's go. Ha!

15:50.701 --> 15:52.286
Good.

16:15.058 --> 16:20.022
So, boss. Come on, bossy. Come on.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.691
What's a nice cow like you doing
in a place like this?

16:22.858 --> 16:25.527
- Unh.
-Reach.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.868
- So this was all a trick.
-You bet your boots.

16:33.076 --> 16:35.704
Now, you keep your hands raised,
don't fuss an inch...

16:35.913 --> 16:38.790
...you might live a while longer, get it?

16:38.999 --> 16:41.877
- Got it.
-Good.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.630
All right, let's split.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.315
Why didn't we try to stop them?

17:03.524 --> 17:04.983
They did exactly as I'd hoped.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.111
- But now we're stuck here.
-Watch.

17:08.362 --> 17:11.448
I had the remote control unit
keep the Batcycle at a safe distance.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.534
It's been following us all the time.

17:21.833 --> 17:24.877
Amazing, but what if someone sees us
on the Batcycle?

17:25.087 --> 17:27.464
We're a mile away
from the entrance to the Batcave.

17:27.673 --> 17:29.591
Allow me, sir. Thank you.

17:29.800 --> 17:34.263
And I know a circuitous route
over a deserted path.

17:36.056 --> 17:39.643
- There you are, Alfred, the Alf-cycle.
-Thank you, sir.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.106
Good bye.

17:47.818 --> 17:50.445
I took the precaution
of coating the limousine's tires...

17:50.654 --> 17:54.032
...with an Infrared Bat Dust
which glows by day as well as by dark.

17:54.241 --> 17:58.328
But you must look at it through the Batmobile's
specially tinted windshield.

17:58.537 --> 18:01.373
Let's go. To the Batcave.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.105
Good.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.275
There. That about does it.

18:28.609 --> 18:33.947
You still think this will haul all that weight
and still outrace the Batmobile?

18:34.448 --> 18:39.411
This thing will be doing 100
while that thing's still in first gear.

18:39.620 --> 18:42.748
Besides, it don't make no difference.

18:42.956 --> 18:46.960
Batman and Robin won't know where we are
or where to find us.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.547
Them two is long gone over the hill.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.678
- Don't that beat all?
-Look out, Batmobile!

18:56.887 --> 18:58.513
Here comes the hay burner!

19:04.269 --> 19:07.898
The best laid plans of mice and men
aft gang agley.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.026
- Who's that?
-You'd better come quietly, Shame.

19:11.234 --> 19:12.986
Let's drill him, boss.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.405
Holster your hardware, fellas.

19:15.614 --> 19:19.826
Wouldn't want no stray bullets
hitting this here truck after all this work.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.912
And all that money facing us.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.831
We ain't got a chance
against the Dynamic Duo.

19:25.040 --> 19:27.542
Leastwise not without guns.

19:27.751 --> 19:31.797
Talking to you is like talking pig latin
to a donkey.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.840
We got them outnumbered.

19:34.049 --> 19:36.927
Three and a half-to-two.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.390
Now, let's hang up their hides.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.725
- Mr. Shame?
-Yeah? What do you want, Andy?

21:48.934 --> 21:52.562
- My radio.
-Well, you beat it, beat it.

21:53.021 --> 21:55.607
Is that Batman and Robin on the floor?

21:55.816 --> 21:56.858
Yeah, what about it?

21:57.067 --> 21:58.109
Did you hurt them?

21:58.318 --> 22:02.739
No, I didn't hurt them.
Now, come on, Mr. Pecos Kid. We--

22:02.948 --> 22:05.659
We're just doing a little show here
for the TV.

22:05.867 --> 22:08.954
We're just doing a little playacting.
Now, come on.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.664
But where are the cameras?

22:10.872 --> 22:13.708
It's hidden, it won't be in the way
like you are. Come on, go.

22:13.917 --> 22:17.170
- Skedaddle. Come on.
-Okay.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.011
Could've fooled me.

22:30.141 --> 22:31.852
Good.

22:32.060 --> 22:34.729
Looks like we got them by the cape,
buckaroos.

22:34.938 --> 22:37.232
Now nothing's gonna stand in our way.

22:37.440 --> 22:40.944
- You gonna shoot them in cold blood, Shame?
-No, that wouldn't be sport.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.864
- So, what you gonna do?
-Got a little plan.

22:53.790 --> 22:57.168
I'll bet you are probably wondering
what all this is for.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.421
That thought did cross my mind.

22:59.796 --> 23:03.717
Pretty soon I'm gonna shoot
this trusty six-shooter of mine...

23:03.925 --> 23:08.388
...and when I do, a herd of cattle
is gonna come stomping this way...

23:08.597 --> 23:10.765
...in a mighty big hurry.

23:10.974 --> 23:12.475
Holy stampede!

23:12.684 --> 23:16.438
Now, those cows don't stop coming
for no man.

23:16.646 --> 23:18.982
Not even you, Bat Fella.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.234
And when they get through stomping...

23:21.443 --> 23:24.654
...there ain't gonna be enough of you left
to put in a thimble.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.781
Shame on you, Shame.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.743
Watch your tongue.

23:30.869 --> 23:32.913
Hasta la vista, partners.

23:33.121 --> 23:37.125
I'll tell everybody you died
with your Bat Boots on.
