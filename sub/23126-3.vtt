WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:02.759
- Previously...

00:02.800 --> 00:03.767
(Screaming)

00:03.800 --> 00:05.461
- There's a better way
to do this.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.491
- Do what?
Be a better monster?

00:07.540 --> 00:08.598
- The apartment?

00:08.640 --> 00:10.836
- We'll invite the neighbours
and eat them.

00:10.870 --> 00:11.940
- I'm Sally! Hi!

00:11.970 --> 00:13.108
- She's a ghost.

00:13.140 --> 00:15.302
- You were marrying
what's-his-face weren't you?

00:15.340 --> 00:16.375
- Danny, yes.

00:16.410 --> 00:19.914
- Right, so why don't
you just go haunt him?

00:19.950 --> 00:21.509
- I would love to leave,

00:21.550 --> 00:22.642
to just open that door

00:22.690 --> 00:24.146
and magically
walk back into

00:24.190 --> 00:26.010
the life that was
ripped from me.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.951
- You're a monster.
And he's not.

00:31.530 --> 00:33.624
- Tell Bishop what happened
last night was a mistake!

00:33.660 --> 00:35.424
- I don't mind
cleaning up your mess.

00:35.460 --> 00:37.428
That's what we do.
We're family.

00:37.470 --> 00:38.790
Who's it gonna be?

00:38.830 --> 00:40.537
Us?

00:41.700 --> 00:43.407
Or them?

00:43.970 --> 00:45.699
- I choose them.

00:47.980 --> 00:49.573
Live forever.

00:49.610 --> 00:52.614
Travel the world in
a million different ways.

00:52.650 --> 00:55.574
Know every lover that
you could possibly want.

00:56.820 --> 00:58.413
Immortality.

01:01.320 --> 01:02.458
What's not to love?

01:04.060 --> 01:08.896
There's just one thing
they leave out of the pitch...

01:08.930 --> 01:10.568
Time...

01:10.600 --> 01:14.036
that endless, sucking time.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.408
No closing bell, no quarter.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.805
No measure...

01:20.610 --> 01:22.078
but memories,

01:22.110 --> 01:24.408
those haunting memories.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.915
Slice 'em, dice 'em, rue 'em.

01:27.950 --> 01:29.679
Do it again.

01:33.690 --> 01:35.715
And realize...

01:35.760 --> 01:38.127
there is only one true thing.

01:40.230 --> 01:44.690
It is impossible to
live forever perfectly.

01:44.730 --> 01:45.800
(Whimpering)

01:55.540 --> 01:57.770
(Car horn honking)

01:59.980 --> 02:02.915
(Chattering)

02:08.490 --> 02:10.378
Tell me you brought
more coffee.

02:10.430 --> 02:11.852
- What?

02:11.890 --> 02:13.426
Wait, wait, wait!

02:13.460 --> 02:15.326
Who are these people?

02:15.360 --> 02:16.725
- Oh yeah, my bad.

02:16.770 --> 02:17.965
Everybody, this is Josh.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.264
Josh, meet the neighbours.

02:20.300 --> 02:22.769
- (AID: Hi, Josh!
- Hi...

02:22.810 --> 02:26.531
- You invited the entire
neighbourhood? Are you insane?

02:26.580 --> 02:29.845
- What are we doing if we can't
say hi to the neighbours?

02:32.680 --> 02:34.569
- No one says hi to
the neighbours anymore.

02:34.620 --> 02:36.179
You know why?
"Cause we're the neighbours!

02:36.220 --> 02:38.780
- Josh, it is a party.
Relax. Now.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.552
I should make
a 7-layer dip, right?

02:42.590 --> 02:44.058
- No.

02:44.090 --> 02:45.728
No, you shouldn't.

02:45.760 --> 02:47.091
- How's it looking out there?

02:47.130 --> 02:50.395
- Hmm, let's see,
we've got Edie, the dry drunk,

02:50.430 --> 02:52.398
Ben, the closet racist,

02:52.440 --> 02:55.239
April, the psychopath masseuse.

02:55.270 --> 02:58.001
You've invited every neighbour
I've ever hated

02:58.040 --> 03:00.179
to be a part of
your neighbourhood watch.

03:00.210 --> 03:02.599
- Neighbourhood what?

03:02.650 --> 03:03.947
- Mingling.

03:06.950 --> 03:08.270
- Just hear me out.

03:08.320 --> 03:09.549
- It makes perfect sense!

03:09.590 --> 03:11.615
Who better to
watch over a neighbourhood

03:11.650 --> 03:12.958
than a couple of monsters?
- Josh!

03:12.990 --> 03:16.483
We need to be a part of
things. This is a part of things.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.689
- I know you've all seen these
around the hood.

03:21.730 --> 03:25.291
Take a good look
at the enemy, people.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.697
- Jesse.
- Josh.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.034
- So, ready to take back
the night or what?

03:32.070 --> 03:35.779
- Some art-school tagger thinks
that our personal property

03:35.810 --> 03:37.539
is his personal artwork?

03:37.580 --> 03:39.344
Uh-uh!

03:39.380 --> 03:41.041
- Excuse me.
- Not anymore.

03:41.080 --> 03:44.050
This joker's left
his exploding mushroom

03:44.090 --> 03:48.152
on our stoops,
our mailboxes, our churches...

03:48.190 --> 03:50.579
- What are you doing?

03:50.630 --> 03:54.123
- Nothing. Waiting for Danny.

03:54.160 --> 03:56.219
- Why?
- I don't know, Josh.

03:56.270 --> 03:57.499
Maybe 'cause last time
he was here,

03:57.530 --> 03:58.964
we had a moment.

03:59.870 --> 04:01.668
We practically touched.

04:01.700 --> 04:04.431
- (Woman): Jim, how many times
have you had to...

04:04.470 --> 04:08.008
- I made Aidan invite him.
- (Jim): Three times!

04:08.040 --> 04:10.407
(Neighbours chattering)

04:10.450 --> 04:12.976
- Welcome Officer
Michael Garrity,

04:13.020 --> 04:15.079
our police liaison
who has so kindly come by

04:15.120 --> 04:16.315
to say a few words
to us tonight.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.839
Thank you, Officer.

04:17.890 --> 04:18.947
(Door opening)

04:18.990 --> 04:19.980
- (Garrity): Thanks.

04:20.019 --> 04:22.751
Well, welcome,
everybody, and...

04:22.790 --> 04:26.249
just a thank you and a quick
reminder: No heroes out there.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.598
Observe and report only.

04:28.630 --> 04:30.325
Leave the hairy stuff
to us cops.

04:30.370 --> 04:32.168
We've got better insurance
than you do.

04:32.200 --> 04:36.603
- Great! OK, so the sign-up
sheet is being passed around.

04:36.640 --> 04:40.804
- Those are mine.
- ...until we catch this guy.

04:40.840 --> 04:43.901
Let's do it.
(Applause)

04:43.950 --> 04:45.349
- All right.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.658
- (Aidan): So, go ahead.

04:54.690 --> 04:58.388
Live forever.
Forget what you've forgotten.

05:04.070 --> 05:06.391
But they won't.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.829
They never do.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.779
- So, vampires
brush their teeth,

05:22.820 --> 05:23.946
but they don't eat?

05:23.990 --> 05:26.118
- Uh, not for sustenance, no,

05:26.150 --> 05:28.687
but maybe for appearances
every now and then.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.484
- And the whole
sunlight thing,

05:30.530 --> 05:33.329
like, shouldn't you explode
when you go outside?

05:34.830 --> 05:36.298
What? I don't know!

05:36.330 --> 05:39.129
Vampires and throw up
scared the crap out of me

05:39.170 --> 05:40.660
as a kid.

05:40.700 --> 05:42.099
(Sighs)

05:42.140 --> 05:43.562
- Um...

05:43.610 --> 05:46.307
Let's just say
that we evolved.

05:46.340 --> 05:48.377
We used to be nocturnal.

05:48.410 --> 05:50.549
Now we're photosensitive.

05:50.580 --> 05:53.948
- Why would he come all the way
over here and then not stay?

05:53.980 --> 05:56.642
Is my energy or whatever
so awful?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.442
- Who?
- Danny.

05:58.490 --> 06:02.654
Is he such pansy ass that he
can't handle a little spookiness?

06:02.690 --> 06:06.900
- Maybe it wasn't you who
creeped him out. Maybe it was Josh.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.989
OK, um...

06:09.030 --> 06:12.091
You want closure, don't
you? You want resolution.

06:12.130 --> 06:15.191
Well, maybe Danny not staying,
maybe that's your closure.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.969
- That doesn't make any sense.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.933
Closure is satisfying,
indefinite.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.631
This is murky and depressing.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.103
- Look, maybe the key
to you moving on

06:23.150 --> 06:24.549
is moving past Danny.

06:24.580 --> 06:26.548
Like, what if you
met someone else?

06:26.580 --> 06:28.070
Someone more like you.

06:28.120 --> 06:29.144
- What does that mean?

06:29.180 --> 06:31.046
- It's...

06:31.890 --> 06:33.016
here.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.516
- What's here?
- Nothing.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.450
But it's downstairs.
You told her, right?

06:37.490 --> 06:38.719
- Well, I was trying to.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.228
- Guys!
- Hey!

06:40.260 --> 06:42.354
(Screaming)

06:42.400 --> 06:45.529
- Why is Axl Rose
standing in my bathtub?

06:45.570 --> 06:47.732
Why aren't you killing him?

06:47.770 --> 06:49.363
- Sally, this is Tony.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.504
- He's a ghost.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.338
- Shut up!

06:54.340 --> 06:55.671
You're a ghost?

06:55.710 --> 06:57.678
- You're a genius.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.111
- When did you die?
- '87.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.415
- Why are you wearing makeup?
- Why aren't you?

07:03.450 --> 07:05.589
Let's start over.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.285
Tony DiPaulo!
Nice to meet you.

07:14.660 --> 07:16.321
(Inaudible)

07:26.040 --> 07:27.576
(Laughing)

07:28.640 --> 07:30.699
- I can't believe it!

07:34.650 --> 07:36.209
- So, we're good here?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.480
- We're just gonna...
- Yeah...

07:46.360 --> 07:47.828
- Tea, please.

07:50.930 --> 07:52.739
So, what's it like
working in a hospital?

07:52.770 --> 07:54.295
- It's OK.

07:54.340 --> 07:56.297
A little sad sometimes.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.078
- Thank you.

08:00.110 --> 08:03.478
What's the saddest thing
you've ever seen?

08:05.550 --> 08:09.043
- Um... the parents
who have children in here.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.479
They're the saddest.

08:10.520 --> 08:14.912
They order coffee, but then they
just sit there and never even touch it.

08:16.460 --> 08:17.450
- Allow me.

08:17.490 --> 08:20.289
- Oh no... it's OK.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.424
- I'll see you soon.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.634
Aidan!

08:26.670 --> 08:29.537
- Compelling the counter girl
into a free drink.

08:29.570 --> 08:32.460
Don't you have
anything better to do?

08:32.510 --> 08:35.035
- Like bailing you out again?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.139
- What now?

08:38.179 --> 08:39.614
- Well...

08:40.880 --> 08:42.347
It's probably nothing.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.984
But when one of my officers

08:44.020 --> 08:46.045
searches a database
for one of us,

08:46.090 --> 08:47.353
it raises a red flag.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.757
- Who searches
a database for me?

08:49.790 --> 08:52.452
- It wouldn't be
the first time.

08:55.330 --> 08:56.456
- Who?

08:57.130 --> 08:59.599
- Michael Garrity.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.768
- Who is Michael Gar--

09:04.270 --> 09:05.908
Officer Garrity.

09:05.940 --> 09:07.704
- Oh, so you do know him?

09:07.740 --> 09:11.005
- Barely. He was in my house
for 10 minutes.

09:11.050 --> 09:12.506
- In your house?

09:13.720 --> 09:15.711
- Look, I'm on it, OK?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.889
I will take care of it.

09:17.920 --> 09:22.653
- Good. Good. He raids a stool
most nights at O'Sheedy's.

09:22.690 --> 09:24.681
Let me know what happens.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.696
- So, you know Aidan
from the hospital?

09:31.730 --> 09:34.529
- Died in the ER. Anyway...

09:34.570 --> 09:35.765
we doing this or what?

09:35.800 --> 09:36.767
- What?

09:36.810 --> 09:38.505
- Blowing this Popsicle stand.

09:38.540 --> 09:40.577
- Yeah, I...

09:40.610 --> 09:43.671
I can't... leave.

09:43.710 --> 09:45.348
- Sure you can.
- I've tried.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.075
It's bad. I get...

09:47.120 --> 09:48.940
I get too close
to the door,

09:48.980 --> 09:52.484
and this rush,
not a good one,

09:52.520 --> 09:55.080
and this roaring
in my ears,

09:55.120 --> 09:58.454
and then the bottom
just drops out.

10:00.160 --> 10:04.859
I'm never going anywhere.
- OK, first of all, you're beyond doors, babe.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.096
That stuff's just
for the breathers.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.438
<i>“You can move
with your thoughts.</i>

10:09.470 --> 10:10.608
- Shut up!

10:10.640 --> 10:11.835
- Yeah!

10:11.870 --> 10:14.077
Door, floors, they don't matter!
We're energy.

10:14.110 --> 10:17.603
But you gotta be centred to
do this stuff, you know?

10:17.650 --> 10:18.879
(Inhaling, exhaling)

10:19.950 --> 10:23.443
Cleansing breath and all that crap? OK?
- Mm-hmm.

10:23.490 --> 10:26.790
- Picture any room
inside the house.

10:29.060 --> 10:30.425
- OK.
- OK.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.428
Take my hand
so I can come with.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.993
(Laughing)
Close your eyes.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.568
Focus.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.640
- I did this?
- You did this.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.057
Well, sort of. I aided.

11:00.090 --> 11:01.580
- Ah!

11:01.620 --> 11:03.827
(Laughing)

11:03.860 --> 11:05.328
Oh!

11:07.360 --> 11:10.193
(* Rock )

11:10.230 --> 11:11.664
- Hey, Aidan, it's Josh.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.362
Hey, I just wanted to
thank you, once again,

11:14.400 --> 11:16.630
for signing us up for
the neighbourhood watch.

11:16.670 --> 11:19.332
Oh, and then ditching
last minute.

11:19.370 --> 11:22.169
That's so cool.

11:26.950 --> 11:30.944
Hi.
I'm late. Sorry.

11:30.990 --> 11:32.139
- Josh!
- Yeah.

11:32.190 --> 11:34.409
- Hey. Jesse.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.758
- Right. That's a great shirt.

11:36.790 --> 11:39.282
- Armband, walkie-talkie.

11:39.330 --> 11:42.652
- Wow! We mean business, huh?

11:42.700 --> 11:45.169
- Yeah. Every 2 minutes,
there's a sexual assault

11:45.200 --> 11:46.270
in this country.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.734
I pray to God
one didn't happen

11:47.770 --> 11:49.260
while we were
waiting for you.

11:51.140 --> 11:52.801
Just kidding.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.774
(Inaudible)

11:59.250 --> 12:01.912
(* Light rock )

12:17.730 --> 12:20.199
- Officer, uh, Garrity!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.129
Right? Aidan.

12:25.740 --> 12:27.333
- Michael.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.870
- Michael, Thanks for
coming by the other night.

12:28.910 --> 12:31.049
Neighbours appreciated it.
One of these.

12:35.120 --> 12:40.388
- And you popped in here
to tell me that?

12:40.420 --> 12:41.512
- I'm sorry?

12:44.790 --> 12:45.928
I just...

12:45.960 --> 12:49.624
I'm a nurse over at SCH.
I'm here all the time.

12:49.660 --> 12:51.094
- Never seen you.

12:51.130 --> 12:52.939
- OK.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.499
- SCH...

12:56.540 --> 13:00.033
You got the full-on psycho stuff
coming through your doors?

13:00.080 --> 13:01.832
- I guess.
You get used to it.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.405
- Hmm...

13:03.450 --> 13:06.943
Well, then you must have
ice water in your veins.

13:06.980 --> 13:10.189
I'm a cop 18 years. And the
stuff we're seeing out there,

13:10.220 --> 13:12.245
what one truly evil
son of a bitch

13:12.290 --> 13:14.759
can do to another
human being...

13:14.790 --> 13:17.521
_ I don't know
a single decent person

13:17.560 --> 13:19.358
who could
get used to that.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.190
- Maybe I misspoke.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.028
- Maybe you didn't.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.722
(Laughing)

13:26.770 --> 13:28.966
Look at you.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.263
Damn!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.732
You think I'm crazy.

13:31.770 --> 13:35.980
- No, I just think you have
the wrong impression of me.

13:36.010 --> 13:37.569
That's all.

13:37.610 --> 13:40.147
- OK. Maybe I do.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.345
(Laughs)

13:45.390 --> 13:46.619
Check this out.

13:54.160 --> 13:56.959
- Who's that?
- Him? He's cancer.

13:58.270 --> 14:02.036
He's been eating at me
since I was 10 years old...

14:02.070 --> 14:03.936
when he murdered my father.

14:10.750 --> 14:14.573
- You know that's not me, right?

14:14.620 --> 14:17.419
I wasn't even born
when you were, what, 10?

14:17.450 --> 14:18.940
- It's impossible, right?

14:19.820 --> 14:21.310
- Yeah.

14:23.160 --> 14:25.720
- So it's gone.

14:25.760 --> 14:26.727
(Laughs)

14:26.760 --> 14:28.558
Forget about it.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.921
Let me buy you one.

14:30.970 --> 14:34.099
- I'm gonna hit the head.
Excuse me.

14:39.940 --> 14:43.808
- This is incredible. You actually
dropped out of MIT med school?

14:43.850 --> 14:49.744
- Well, no. No, I never
actually enrolled.

14:49.780 --> 14:51.885
- So, what, Internet?

14:51.920 --> 14:54.287
You started some
Internet thing. I hate you.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.186
- Me? No, I actually...

14:56.220 --> 14:58.621
I kind of went
the other way.

14:59.760 --> 15:01.353
(Laughs)

15:01.400 --> 15:03.164
- Dude...

15:04.330 --> 15:05.729
- "Dude" what?

15:05.770 --> 15:08.034
- Nothing. It's just...

15:08.070 --> 15:09.731
I respect it.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.169
That's all.

15:11.210 --> 15:12.632
(Laughs)

15:12.670 --> 15:14.570
(Water running)

15:21.450 --> 15:24.317
- Look, I'm sorry, man.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.810
- No worries, really.

15:26.850 --> 15:30.024
- I brought all my personal crap
down on your head, and...

15:30.060 --> 15:31.880
Hey, it was wrong,
professionally.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.557
It was just wrong.
I apologize.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.750
- No, honestly, really,
forget about it.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.029
It's no big deal.

15:37.070 --> 15:39.459
- It's just... it is.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.931
- Are you gonna let me out?

15:42.970 --> 15:45.564
- I don't know.
Let's see.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.169
When I saw you
the other night,

15:49.210 --> 15:53.249
I said to myself; "Garrity,
you have got to let this go."

15:53.280 --> 15:54.247
- Yeah.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.489
- So, just to be sure,
I ran your file.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.318
You know what's in there?

16:00.320 --> 16:01.958
Nothing.

16:01.990 --> 16:04.357
You see, this...

16:06.630 --> 16:09.622
This... doesn't exist.

16:09.660 --> 16:11.162
- You're drunk.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.292
- Yeah.

16:12.330 --> 16:15.994
You're gonna answer me
one more question.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.235
Who's Celine?

16:17.270 --> 16:18.908
- What?

16:18.940 --> 16:21.875
- That man who murdered
my father in front of me

16:21.910 --> 16:25.904
had the name "Celine"
tattooed on his chest.

16:28.280 --> 16:29.611
- You're insane.

16:30.650 --> 16:33.688
- On that, we agree.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.119
Come on. Pick it up.

16:41.830 --> 16:43.366
- Excuse me.

16:49.770 --> 16:51.499
(Chatter on TV)

16:51.540 --> 16:54.032
(Sally and Tony laughing)

16:55.910 --> 16:59.210
- We're moving places
all over the house.

16:59.250 --> 17:00.342
On purpose!

17:01.850 --> 17:05.513
Oh! Look at you!
You made friends!

17:05.550 --> 17:06.983
- Oh, I love this movie!

17:07.020 --> 17:08.657
- Oh, I love this!

17:08.690 --> 17:10.988
- (Woman on TV):
Hi, Andrew.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.419
- Ah!
- You OK?

17:13.460 --> 17:18.000
Throat?
- No. What? No. I had a frog in my throat.

17:18.030 --> 17:19.520
(Chuckling)

17:21.200 --> 17:22.861
- OK, OK, we'll go.

17:22.900 --> 17:24.834
Should we do the bathroom again?

17:24.869 --> 17:27.406
- No. You're ready.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.771
- For what?

17:29.880 --> 17:31.848
No.

17:31.880 --> 17:33.917
- So ready.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.585
- Just focus.

17:38.620 --> 17:40.782
Like we've been doing.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.481
(Sally exhales)

17:42.520 --> 17:45.751
- Wet leaves, chimney smoke...

17:45.790 --> 17:47.394
birds...

17:47.430 --> 17:49.159
the neighbour's dog...

17:53.840 --> 17:56.093
(Chuckles)

17:56.140 --> 17:57.869
- OK?

18:01.780 --> 18:03.976
- Outside?
- Outside.

18:19.860 --> 18:21.021
(Sally laughing)

18:26.500 --> 18:28.332
- Whoa!

18:29.040 --> 18:30.303
Get out of me!

18:30.340 --> 18:33.002
- Hang on!
Our matter got tangled.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.629
Jeez!

18:35.680 --> 18:37.170
That was a beautiful moment!

18:37.210 --> 18:38.803
- Yeah, until you ruined it!

18:38.850 --> 18:40.511
- I don't usually
get complaints,

18:40.550 --> 18:43.042
especially not from
the ones looking for it.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.639
- What?
- You know what?

18:44.690 --> 18:47.250
Way too heavy for my blood.
I'm outski.

18:47.290 --> 18:50.055
- Yeah, go haunt
a Kix concert, perv

18:50.090 --> 18:53.082
- Lazy days
and better lays, sweetheart.

19:04.570 --> 19:07.699
- God, don't do that.
- So, I'm easy?

19:07.740 --> 19:09.879
That's your grand
impression of me?

19:09.910 --> 19:11.344
- What?

19:12.580 --> 19:15.971
Well, Tony's more Aidan's
friend. You know that, right?

19:16.020 --> 19:17.840
- I don't care whose
friend he is, Josh!

19:17.890 --> 19:19.449
I'm engaged!

19:19.490 --> 19:20.685
Was engaged.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.256
- Right, but you're
not now, right?

19:22.290 --> 19:27.160
So, if it's been a while, don't you
think we could all use a rebound ghost?

19:27.200 --> 19:29.453
- Really? And when was
the last time you had sex?

19:29.500 --> 19:31.389
- (Laughing):
I don't know.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.331
If we have to, like,
put a number on this...

19:34.370 --> 19:36.361
- I don't need your help,
dry spell.

19:40.310 --> 19:42.301
- I had a special friend once.

19:42.340 --> 19:43.978
Demekra.

19:45.350 --> 19:47.273
And then OJ got off.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.243
We never spoke again.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.352
(Siren in distance)

19:57.390 --> 19:59.586
(Intense beating)

19:59.630 --> 20:01.724
(Sighs)

20:03.270 --> 20:05.261
(Grunting)

20:10.410 --> 20:11.900
- Pick it up.

20:17.380 --> 20:18.643
- Stop it!

20:18.680 --> 20:21.115
Stop it!
- Let me go!

20:21.150 --> 20:22.618
- There are things
you don't understand,

20:22.650 --> 20:25.244
things we all can't understand,
you hear me?

20:25.290 --> 20:26.780
Now, you forget about me.
You forget we ever met.

20:26.820 --> 20:29.585
That's the only resolution
you are ever gonna get here.

20:29.620 --> 20:31.156
(Coughing)

20:32.530 --> 20:36.421
(Crying)

20:36.460 --> 20:38.064
(Sighing)

20:42.200 --> 20:44.999
(Gasping)

21:08.800 --> 21:10.495
(Screaming)

21:14.570 --> 21:16.368
(Continues screaming)

21:20.740 --> 21:22.731
(Groaning)

21:28.720 --> 21:32.145
- Going to work!
- Wait, wait, wait! Page.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.655
Mmm...

21:44.230 --> 21:45.823
(Giggling): Thank you!

21:47.970 --> 21:51.929
- Hey! Casper,
the handsy ghost!

21:51.970 --> 21:53.904
Not the plan, man.

21:53.940 --> 21:55.203
- I'm sorry.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.401
I'm a jerk.

21:56.440 --> 21:58.249
- You think?

21:58.280 --> 22:01.614
- I've been feeling bad about
the whole grope-and-ditch.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.879
- Wow, that's moving.

22:02.920 --> 22:04.581
Sally, do you need a tissue?

22:04.620 --> 22:05.940
- Hey, no offence, guy,

22:05.990 --> 22:09.051
but this is kind of
a spirit-world situation.

22:16.730 --> 22:20.837
I don't see a lot of ghosts like you.
- Ones with backbones?

22:20.870 --> 22:22.235
- Here's how it goes.

22:22.270 --> 22:27.231
Usually, a ghost is around just
long enough to have a little fun.

22:27.270 --> 22:30.274
But the longer a ghost
circles the drain, crazier it goes.

22:30.310 --> 22:32.449
- Well, that explains you.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.879
- Point is,

22:33.920 --> 22:38.380
a normal ghost that you actually
wanna hang with is rare.

22:39.950 --> 22:41.418
- So, what, you...

22:41.460 --> 22:43.883
you want me to help you
pass the time

22:43.930 --> 22:46.456
until you completely nut out?

23:08.380 --> 23:10.041
(Grunting)

23:26.400 --> 23:30.268
- So, Garrity didn't show
for roll call this morning.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.139
And you look about
4 quarts short of a gallon.

23:34.180 --> 23:35.170
What happened?

23:36.780 --> 23:38.942
- He thinks
I killed his father.

23:38.980 --> 23:40.345
- Did you?
- I don't know.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.247
He... had a police sketch.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.987
It could have been me.

23:46.290 --> 23:50.079
- So apologize.
(Laughing)

23:52.190 --> 23:53.658
- Oh, you're serious.

23:53.700 --> 23:58.467
Just tell him what I am. Declare
myself. Hell, declare us all.

23:58.500 --> 23:59.763
- Or what?

23:59.800 --> 24:00.938
Lie to him?

24:00.970 --> 24:04.338
Deny him his right to know
how the world really is?

24:04.370 --> 24:10.139
I am surprised at you, Aidan. I thought your
new lifestyle made you more compassionate.

24:10.180 --> 24:12.205
- I told you, I've got it.

24:12.250 --> 24:15.811
- Really? Just out
of curiosity, how?

24:17.380 --> 24:19.644
- There are other ways.

24:19.690 --> 24:23.149
- Mmm. What are you gonna do,
brainwash him?

24:23.190 --> 24:26.182
Make him forget
what you did to his dad?

24:26.230 --> 24:28.995
You really trust yourself
inside this guy's head?

24:29.030 --> 24:29.997
- That's funny.

24:30.030 --> 24:32.169
When I do it,
it's brainwashing.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.066
But when you do it
for a cup of tea,

24:34.100 --> 24:36.467
it's, what, seduction.

24:36.500 --> 24:37.865
- When was the last time

24:37.910 --> 24:40.971
you compelled anybody
to do anything?

24:41.010 --> 24:42.000
Decades?

24:42.040 --> 24:45.010
You're too weak, Aidan.

24:45.050 --> 24:47.109
You don't even
drink live blood.

24:47.150 --> 24:49.209
You were never that good
at it to begin with,

24:49.250 --> 24:50.945
but do you really think
you're strong enough

24:50.990 --> 24:54.813
to dip in
and pluck out a memory?

24:54.860 --> 24:57.010
What if you wipe him clean?

24:57.060 --> 24:59.483
What if you drive him mad?

25:01.060 --> 25:03.768
You will not put
this family in jeopardy.

25:07.130 --> 25:12.637
- I will do whatever I want
whenever I want.

25:12.670 --> 25:14.377
This family...

25:16.110 --> 25:18.442
can go screw themselves.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.045
- I love it.

25:27.090 --> 25:28.512
(Birds chirping)

25:28.560 --> 25:29.982
What is this place?

25:30.020 --> 25:31.579
- Turn around.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.692
Beautiful, right?

25:39.730 --> 25:44.270
Most of the ghosts I meet,
they don't get it yet,

25:44.310 --> 25:45.766
the whole "dead" thing.

25:45.810 --> 25:47.699
So I show them their graves.

25:48.740 --> 25:50.401
Let it sink in.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.118
(Exhales)

26:01.320 --> 26:04.824
- I never liked the idea
of taking up space...

26:06.890 --> 26:08.551
rotting away.

26:11.830 --> 26:13.491
But now...

26:15.400 --> 26:16.993
I don't know.

26:17.040 --> 26:18.929
I can see the appeal...

26:19.870 --> 26:22.601
to be in a place
where people can find you.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.144
(Exhales)
OK.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.913
So then what?

26:29.950 --> 26:34.649
- Normally, I'd quote
a little Slayer and we'd mac it.

26:34.690 --> 26:38.649
- And after that?
- A door shows up. We kiss goodbye.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.328
They cry about
having to leave me.

26:40.360 --> 26:41.395
- A door?

26:41.430 --> 26:44.968
- Yeah, a portal that
takes you beyond, whatever.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.866
It pops up when
it's time for you to mosey.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.369
Custom-made just for you.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.563
- So where's yours?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.009
- Don't know. Don't care.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.530
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.275
- You've been dead since '87

26:56.310 --> 26:58.005
and you have no desire
to move on?

26:58.050 --> 26:59.074
- No.

26:59.110 --> 27:01.420
- I've been dead 7 months
and I'm going crazy!

27:01.450 --> 27:03.248
- Your spirit's blocked.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.918
- How do you know?

27:04.950 --> 27:06.418
- Banged a Buddhist once.

27:06.450 --> 27:09.488
The point is,
something's holding you back.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.998
- Can I try something?

27:19.530 --> 27:20.622
(Laughs)

27:20.670 --> 27:22.490
- LT. Hey.
- Hey.

27:22.540 --> 27:24.099
Missed you at the shop today.

27:24.140 --> 27:25.210
- Yeah, I...

27:25.240 --> 27:27.436
I must have
caught something.

27:28.710 --> 27:30.849
- May I come in?

27:30.880 --> 27:32.700
- What?

27:32.750 --> 27:34.946
Yeah, sure.

27:41.790 --> 27:42.780
Uh...

27:44.490 --> 27:46.788
Can I get you a drink?

27:48.660 --> 27:51.300
- How about a coffee instead?

27:52.630 --> 27:55.099
Sit.

28:00.340 --> 28:01.501
(Coughs)

28:01.540 --> 28:03.599
Well, I can't help but notice

28:03.640 --> 28:05.904
you haven't been yourself
the last few days.

28:05.950 --> 28:07.714
- What?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.479
No, I'm good.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.740
- Well, my point is
that guys like us,

28:12.790 --> 28:14.815
work is family.

28:14.860 --> 28:18.387
And it's easy to
get lost in it,

28:18.430 --> 28:21.650
caught up, consumed.

28:23.100 --> 28:26.229
Hell, it can swallow you whole
if you're not careful.

28:26.270 --> 28:28.193
(Coffee pouring)

28:29.500 --> 28:31.867
What's eating at you, Mike?

28:34.240 --> 28:35.901
- Bishop...

28:43.420 --> 28:45.684
you believe in monsters?

28:47.390 --> 28:49.358
- You know what?

28:50.290 --> 28:52.759
I do.

28:56.830 --> 28:58.867
(Exhaling)

29:00.030 --> 29:01.930
- Where are we?

29:01.970 --> 29:04.200
- Danny's old place.

29:04.240 --> 29:06.766
Or new place.
I guess he moved back.

29:06.810 --> 29:08.209
- Danny?

29:09.240 --> 29:10.401
- My fiance.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.507
How do I touch him?

29:13.550 --> 29:15.518
- You can't.
- Really?

29:15.550 --> 29:17.245
- You and me,
we're on the same plane.

29:17.280 --> 29:19.248
But he's a different
story, solid.

29:26.690 --> 29:28.727
- And that doesn't
bother you?

29:30.560 --> 29:33.200
I mean,
don't you miss someone?

29:34.170 --> 29:36.798
Haven't you ever
been in love?

29:36.840 --> 29:38.308
- Come on.

29:40.940 --> 29:42.305
- I don't believe you.

29:44.250 --> 29:47.811
Nobody lives their whole life
without loving someone.

29:47.850 --> 29:50.774
- I didn't live my whole life.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.709
- So there's no one
that you wanna go back to?

29:52.750 --> 29:56.880
- Even if there was,
you can't go back.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.005
You can watch him
sleep all night.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.848
It's not gonna
change anything.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.287
- It changes how I feel.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.921
- Oh, hey, I got an interview
at Suffolk County.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.495
Yeah, residency.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.338
- Oh yeah? That's...

30:44.570 --> 30:46.060
Good for you.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.172
- Yeah, isn't that
where you...

30:49.210 --> 30:52.180
Isn't that where you do
your orderly thing or...

30:52.210 --> 30:53.280
- Uh-huh.

30:54.380 --> 30:56.439
(Inhaling)

30:56.480 --> 30:58.517
(Sniffs)

30:58.550 --> 31:00.188
- What?

31:00.220 --> 31:01.255
- Paint.

31:03.460 --> 31:05.019
- What...

31:05.060 --> 31:06.619
What paint?

31:06.660 --> 31:08.628
(Spraying)

31:12.800 --> 31:15.132
- Neighbourhood watch!

31:21.040 --> 31:24.044
- I called the police. Yeah!

31:24.080 --> 31:26.299
You hear that?
I called the police!

31:28.020 --> 31:29.977
(Grunting)

31:30.020 --> 31:32.341
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Josh!

31:32.390 --> 31:34.813
Josh, they're on the way, man!

31:34.860 --> 31:36.612
Josh!

31:38.490 --> 31:39.685
(Choking)

31:39.730 --> 31:42.722
- Josh! Josh! Chill!

31:42.760 --> 31:44.660
(Gags)

31:48.970 --> 31:50.597
Dude...

31:51.870 --> 31:54.009
(Sirens approaching)

32:01.020 --> 32:03.876
(Man coughing)
OK...

32:03.920 --> 32:06.548
- That kid is a vampire?

32:07.890 --> 32:08.960
How do you know this?

32:10.560 --> 32:13.427
- 'Cause I'm the one
who turned him.

32:25.740 --> 32:28.380
And I wanna make you
an offer, Michael.

32:30.840 --> 32:33.480
This is exactly
what we need.

32:33.510 --> 32:36.116
You're strong.
You're smart.

32:36.150 --> 32:38.118
A soldier.

32:39.290 --> 32:41.452
Let me give you immortality.

32:50.760 --> 32:52.421
(Door slides open)

32:56.770 --> 32:58.238
(Dog barking in distance)

33:16.820 --> 33:18.128
Marcus...

33:36.110 --> 33:37.669
(Garrity breathing heavily)

33:37.710 --> 33:39.075
(Grunting)

33:46.090 --> 33:47.046
(Door closing)

33:47.090 --> 33:48.353
- Where were you?

33:49.990 --> 33:52.459
- Just keeping
the streets of Boston safe

33:52.490 --> 33:54.197
for all the little children.

33:54.230 --> 33:55.789
- You OK?
- Yeah.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.127
Where were you, Ozzfest?

33:59.000 --> 34:01.367
- Danny's.

34:01.400 --> 34:02.890
(Sighs)

34:02.940 --> 34:07.264
- I thought the whole point
of this was to move on.

34:09.739 --> 34:10.969
- Don't worry.

34:11.010 --> 34:13.478
I guess I can live
at Danny's now.

34:13.510 --> 34:16.241
- I don't want you
to live at Danny's.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.282
- What if that's what
I need to do to move on?

34:21.719 --> 34:23.358
- OK.

34:30.530 --> 34:32.862
Maybe you're not
trying to move on.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.639
Maybe you're trying to stay.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.808
- If I leave,
he'll forget me.

34:49.380 --> 34:53.715
- If you stay...
he'll forget you.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.828
(Exhales)

34:58.860 --> 35:00.350
You're not here.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.398
- I'm lonely.

35:09.370 --> 35:10.963
- Me too.

35:19.050 --> 35:21.712
- It's OK. Hey, it's OK!

35:21.750 --> 35:22.945
It'll be over soon.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.641
You'll go back to your life.
It'll be like nothing happened.

35:24.690 --> 35:26.044
You won't remember this.

35:26.090 --> 35:27.717
You won't remember anything.

35:27.750 --> 35:30.310
Don't scream.

35:44.610 --> 35:45.839
(Grunting)

35:54.580 --> 35:56.446
(Exhaling)

36:00.990 --> 36:02.719
No...

36:02.760 --> 36:06.355
No, no, no, no!
Come on! No!

36:07.630 --> 36:09.359
(Muffled screaming)

36:12.930 --> 36:16.730
- I'm not turning into it
in the hospital anymore.

36:16.770 --> 36:19.239
- Why not?
That room is perfect.

36:19.270 --> 36:20.908
- The woods are better.

36:27.550 --> 36:29.814
We're not quite real,
are we?

36:31.720 --> 36:34.883
The closer I bring
that side of me to real people,

36:34.920 --> 36:36.854
the more people
I seem to hurt.

36:39.360 --> 36:41.180
I can't hurt anybody else.

36:44.300 --> 36:47.224
Some things just need
to stay separate.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.724
Didn't you need
to talk to him?

37:13.760 --> 37:15.899
- No, I'm good.

37:16.660 --> 37:18.424
You ready?

37:19.070 --> 37:20.629
- OK...

37:32.710 --> 37:35.418
- So, thanks for
ruining my death.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.109
- What's wrong?

37:39.550 --> 37:42.554
- You know, before you,
I was fine.

37:42.590 --> 37:44.752
Then you get me thinking
about all this stuff

37:44.790 --> 37:46.679
that I don't need
to be thinking about!

37:49.730 --> 37:51.198
I went to Debbie's.

37:51.230 --> 37:52.595
- Debbie?

37:52.630 --> 37:53.597
- Debbie Rinaldi,

37:53.630 --> 37:55.962
the stupid love of
my dumb-ass wasted life.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.037
Didn't think about her
once I bit it.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.799
I mean, what's
the point, right?

37:59.840 --> 38:01.569
- Closure?

38:01.610 --> 38:03.374
- Right.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.242
Twenty-three years.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.749
I finally go
make sure she's happy.

38:09.550 --> 38:10.745
And so?

38:10.780 --> 38:12.384
She's happy.

38:12.420 --> 38:13.683
Great!

38:13.720 --> 38:16.087
Screw closure!

38:27.430 --> 38:28.932
(Exhales)

38:28.970 --> 38:31.064
I guess this is it.

38:32.540 --> 38:34.099
(Exhales)

38:44.620 --> 38:46.110
- Tony...

38:49.760 --> 38:51.114
It's not for me.

38:51.160 --> 38:52.685
- How do you know?

38:52.730 --> 38:54.528
- I can just feel it.

39:14.620 --> 39:18.045
- What the hell
am I supposed to do in there?

39:18.080 --> 39:20.583
- Start a hair band, garden...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.319
Just go.

39:30.760 --> 39:32.023
- You can touch.

39:32.070 --> 39:34.198
- What?
- Humans.

39:34.230 --> 39:36.369
It's tricky, though.
They gotta be open to it.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.390
They have to want it.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.566
- Why didn't you--

39:38.610 --> 39:40.032
- I didn't know...

39:40.070 --> 39:41.777
till last night.

39:41.810 --> 39:43.676
I touched her hand.

39:45.210 --> 39:46.507
- What was it like?

40:15.480 --> 40:19.940
- (Man on PA): Blood
number 3427. Blood 3427. Stat.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.379
- Hey!

40:21.410 --> 40:23.048
- Hey.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.617
- Just did the tour.
- Yeah? Awesome.

40:25.650 --> 40:28.017
- Yeah. So you wanna grab
some lunch or something?

40:28.050 --> 40:30.690
- Uh, damn, I can't.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.484
Work.

40:32.530 --> 40:33.929
- Another time.

40:33.960 --> 40:36.292
- Totally.

40:36.330 --> 40:38.469
- OK.

40:39.500 --> 40:40.695
Hey.

40:40.730 --> 40:42.459
Who am I?

40:42.500 --> 40:44.332
Superstar!

40:54.520 --> 40:56.818
- My apologies.
You were right.

40:56.850 --> 40:58.272
Your way was
definitely better.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.779
Far, far more compassionate.

41:08.360 --> 41:11.125
(Chatter on TV)

41:17.000 --> 41:18.559
- Danny...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.475
(Doorbell ringing)

41:42.230 --> 41:44.119
- Hey!
- (Woman): Hi.

41:44.160 --> 41:46.925
- Come on in.
- Thanks for calling.

41:48.600 --> 41:49.931
- Bridget?

41:51.340 --> 41:53.729
(Bottle opening)

41:59.950 --> 42:01.941
- I miss her, too.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.610
(Sniffs)
