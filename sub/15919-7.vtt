as "Dr. Joy," is back.

09:32.375 --> 09:33.540
Welcome to the show.

09:33.542 --> 09:34.750
- It's lovely being back.
- Nice to see you.

09:34.754 --> 09:36.498
You know, it's funny.

09:36.500 --> 09:39.083
- The last time you were here, you
- talked about your one-year rule,

09:39.086 --> 09:40.313
In which people

09:40.314 --> 09:41.540
who had lost a spouse

09:41.542 --> 09:43.210
due to death or divorce

09:43.211 --> 09:44.874
or even a breakup

09:44.875 --> 09:46.022
should wait

09:46.023 --> 09:47.165
a minimum of one year

09:47.166 --> 09:49.083
- before resuming
- romantic relationships?

09:49.086 --> 09:50.167
Yes, ma'am,

09:50.168 --> 09:51.248
and by my calculations,

09:51.250 --> 09:53.500
- you should be almost ready to
- get back in the swing of things.

09:53.503 --> 09:55.749
[laughs]

09:55.750 --> 09:57.147
Today it's a case of

09:57.148 --> 09:58.540
good news, bad news, good news.

09:58.542 --> 09:59.585
America is pulling out

09:59.586 --> 10:00.624
of its economic slump;

10:00.625 --> 10:01.874
that's the good news.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.458
- The bad news
- is that divorce rates

10:03.462 --> 10:06.041
- Are increasing now that couples
- can afford to divorce

10:06.045 --> 10:08.123
And support two households.

10:08.125 --> 10:09.313
In doing so, the housing

10:09.314 --> 10:10.498
and construction markets

10:10.500 --> 10:11.582
are seeing a boom.

10:11.583 --> 10:13.081
Is that the good news?

10:13.083 --> 10:14.665
If you're in construction.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.418
The problem is that capitalism

10:16.419 --> 10:18.165
is really fueled

10:18.166 --> 10:19.397
by disappointment

10:19.398 --> 10:20.624
and dysfunction.

10:20.625 --> 10:21.834
You feel unhappy, you go

10:21.835 --> 10:23.040
and buy a new pair of shoes.

10:23.041 --> 10:24.167
You buy a new car.

10:24.168 --> 10:25.290
You buy a new house.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.855
Unfortunately, it doesn't deal

10:26.856 --> 10:28.415
with the inner void.

10:28.417 --> 10:29.665
You're still unhappy.

10:29.667 --> 10:31.291
- It doesn't deal
- with the relationship.

10:31.295 --> 10:32.376
So how do you keep

10:32.377 --> 10:33.457
a relationship together?

10:33.458 --> 10:35.166
- Well, kiddo, you're really
- asking, with all due respect,

10:35.170 --> 10:36.665
The wrong question.

10:36.667 --> 10:38.542
- It's not "how do
- we keep relationships together?"

10:38.545 --> 10:39.647
It's "how do we

10:39.648 --> 10:40.749
like ourselves enough,

10:40.750 --> 10:43.125
- respect ourselves enough
- that other people respect us?"

10:43.128 --> 10:44.293
Which is the basis

10:44.294 --> 10:45.457
of a good relationship.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.771
If you don't like you,

10:46.772 --> 10:48.081
nobody else is going to either.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.375
- You know, what I love
- about you, Dr. Joy,

10:49.378 --> 10:50.418
Is that you just

10:50.419 --> 10:51.457
tell it like it is.

10:51.458 --> 10:52.498
Well, thank you.

10:52.500 --> 10:54.081
I thought what we'd try today

10:54.083 --> 10:55.772
is a modification of something

10:55.773 --> 10:57.457
called the Johari window,

10:57.458 --> 10:58.938
and it was evolved

10:58.939 --> 11:00.415
in the '50s by two guys...

11:00.417 --> 11:02.168
one, Joseph Lutz, and the other

11:02.169 --> 11:03.916
is Harrington Ingham.

11:03.917 --> 11:05.522
And what it is

11:05.523 --> 11:07.123
is four quadrants,

11:07.125 --> 11:08.293
and it's a way

11:08.294 --> 11:09.457
of looking at who you are

11:09.458 --> 11:10.707
and who you'd like to be.

11:10.709 --> 11:13.165
The first is an open area

11:13.166 --> 11:14.834
which contains information

11:14.835 --> 11:16.498
about our behavior

11:16.500 --> 11:18.710
and motivation of which both we

11:18.711 --> 11:20.916
and other people are aware.

11:20.917 --> 11:22.500
- (Mary Jane) - I know you told David
- About the sperm.

11:22.503 --> 11:24.123
I thought you were my friend.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.125
(Nichelle)

11:25.126 --> 11:26.125
What are you talking...

11:24.125 --> 11:26.123
I haven't seen David.

11:26.125 --> 11:27.688
That man had you stuck

11:27.689 --> 11:29.248
on stupid then,

11:29.250 --> 11:32.123
and he's got you twisted now.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.542
- (Dr. Joy)
- Conversely, the second quadrant

11:34.545 --> 11:36.582
Is the blind area,

11:36.583 --> 11:38.855
what people say about us that we

11:38.856 --> 11:41.123
refuse to hear or accept.

11:41.125 --> 11:43.333
- No, no, no, no.
- I tried to make it work, Dad.

11:43.337 --> 11:44.957
I cannot raise three children.

11:44.959 --> 11:46.291
- Yeah,
- 'cause you're too busy

11:46.295 --> 11:47.834
- Throwing back
- them tequila shots.

11:47.837 --> 11:49.332
That is a lie.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.397
(Dr. Joy)

11:50.398 --> 11:51.458
The third quadrant

11:49.333 --> 11:51.457
is the hidden area,

11:51.458 --> 11:52.709
the things we're unwilling

11:52.710 --> 11:53.957
to share with others,

11:53.959 --> 11:55.397
perhaps because

11:55.398 --> 11:56.832
we don't trust them

11:56.834 --> 11:58.582
or we think they won't love us.

11:58.583 --> 11:59.938
Finally,

11:59.939 --> 12:01.290
the most fascinating quadrant

12:01.291 --> 12:03.585
is the unknown area,

12:03.586 --> 12:05.874
signified by a question mark.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.418
These are the things that are

12:07.419 --> 12:08.957
unknown to you and others.

12:08.959 --> 12:10.272
And once you journey

12:10.273 --> 12:11.582
through these areas,

12:11.583 --> 12:13.355
we can come closer to answering

12:13.356 --> 12:15.123
the question of who we are

12:15.125 --> 12:17.083
and what we want to be.

12:18.917 --> 12:20.251
Man, I cannot believe

12:20.252 --> 12:21.582
that she did that to me.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.749
I can't believe it.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.123
What are you talking about?

12:24.125 --> 12:25.917
- That's the same thing
- she did last time

12:25.921 --> 12:27.290
And the time before that.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.959
- I mean,
- this is what y'all do.

12:28.962 --> 12:30.125
- I mean, one minute
- she's telling me,

12:30.128 --> 12:32.291
- "Come over.
- Let's try to get pregnant."

12:32.295 --> 12:34.625
- Next thing I know, she's talking
- about signs from God

12:34.629 --> 12:35.916
And telling me to leave.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.083
- Well, at least
- you can credit her

12:37.086 --> 12:38.373
For bringing in an expert.

12:38.375 --> 12:39.415
Yeah, whatever.

12:39.417 --> 12:40.874
This is exactly the reason

12:40.875 --> 12:41.792
- I stopped messing
- with black women.

12:41.795 --> 12:44.373
Okay, I'ma lend you an ear,

12:44.375 --> 12:45.875
- but you're not gonna talk
- out the side of your neck

12:45.879 --> 12:47.415
About black women.

12:47.417 --> 12:49.083
- I'm married
- to a black woman.

12:49.086 --> 12:50.540
My mother's a black woman.

12:50.542 --> 12:51.731
And we're not gonna let

12:51.732 --> 12:52.916
Mary Jane define this moment

12:52.917 --> 12:54.415
for all black women.

12:54.417 --> 12:55.749
Sorry, man. Sorry.

12:55.750 --> 12:57.291
- Besides, what's going on
- with you and Mary Jane

12:57.295 --> 12:59.125
- Has nothing to do
- with her being black.

12:59.128 --> 13:00.168
It's about you

13:00.169 --> 13:01.207
both being too prideful

13:01.208 --> 13:02.751
and too hardheaded about getting

13:02.752 --> 13:04.290
your life together, all right?

13:04.291 --> 13:05.334
Both of you to blame

13:05.335 --> 13:06.373
for games you played

13:06.375 --> 13:07.793
and the times you've wasted,

13:07.794 --> 13:09.207
and just like I told you,

13:09.208 --> 13:10.730
Ana was gonna try to cash in

13:10.731 --> 13:12.248
on that modeling career.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.957
Ah.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.207

13:16.208 --> 13:17.582
Well, don't drink too much

13:17.583 --> 13:19.083
- and forget about what we
- talked about, all right?

13:19.086 --> 13:20.251
'Cause I am tired

13:20.252 --> 13:21.415
of this conversation, D.

13:21.417 --> 13:23.459
You got me and Valerie

13:23.460 --> 13:25.498

13:33.917 --> 13:35.375
- I was no saint in this.
- I know that.

13:35.378 --> 13:37.291
- I wasn't the best
- communicator. Great.

13:37.295 --> 13:38.688
But I never lied to that girl,

13:38.689 --> 13:40.081
not one time, not once.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.166
- Dude,
- just because you didn't lie

13:41.170 --> 13:44.332
Doesn't mean you communicated.

13:44.333 --> 13:46.373
That's what I said.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.709
- (Kara)
- Those are competitive numbers,

17:10.712 --> 17:12.396
So that means

17:12.396 --> 17:14.080
that I need to hear

17:14.083 --> 17:15.334
some great pitches

17:15.335 --> 17:16.582
on the issues that matter

17:16.583 --> 17:17.752
surrounding this election,

17:17.752 --> 17:18.915
all right?

17:18.916 --> 17:23.415
For example, education.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.080
Minimum wage.

17:25.083 --> 17:26.855
- Um, gun control.

17:26.856 --> 17:28.624
- Yup.

17:28.625 --> 17:31.665
"Who's voting now" stories.

17:31.667 --> 17:33.084
All right? The point is,

17:33.085 --> 17:34.498
let's get creative.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.583
Let's think outside the box.

17:39.291 --> 17:41.083
Um...

17:43.583 --> 17:44.834
Same-sex will always be

17:44.835 --> 17:46.083
a hot issue.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.540
Excuse me.

18:01.542 --> 18:02.874
What was that?

18:02.875 --> 18:04.207
What did I do now?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.397
We just keep

18:05.398 --> 18:06.582
doing the same thing

18:06.583 --> 18:08.707
over and over and over again,

18:08.709 --> 18:09.709
and it's not

18:09.710 --> 18:10.708
what we set out to do,

18:10.710 --> 18:12.916
and I can't do it anymore.

18:12.917 --> 18:16.083
What? You can't do your job?

18:21.083 --> 18:22.667
Is your life so good that you

18:22.668 --> 18:24.248
can't do what's expected of you

18:24.250 --> 18:25.501
because it's too much

18:25.502 --> 18:26.749
of a burden?

18:26.750 --> 18:28.498
Please. Kill the melodrama.

18:28.500 --> 18:29.665
Really?

18:29.667 --> 18:31.165
We could be doing better,

18:31.166 --> 18:32.334
but we're just doing

18:32.335 --> 18:33.498
what everyone else is doing.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.792
Talk Back was supposed

18:34.793 --> 18:36.081
to be different, remember?

18:36.083 --> 18:38.125
- Talk Back was supposed to have
- a different perspective,

18:38.128 --> 18:39.334
One that nobody else

18:39.335 --> 18:40.540
was thinking about

18:40.542 --> 18:42.001
or dared to even consider,

18:42.002 --> 18:43.457
let alone air.

18:43.458 --> 18:45.063
Mary Jane, you know that

18:45.064 --> 18:46.665
we've always had to give them

18:46.667 --> 18:48.834
- a little bit of what they want
- to get what we want.

18:48.837 --> 18:50.792
- Except I never got
- what I wanted.

18:50.795 --> 18:52.081
What are you talking about?

18:52.083 --> 18:53.251
You just went rogue

18:53.252 --> 18:54.415
on a suicide piece.

18:54.417 --> 18:56.064
And I also did the modern-day

18:56.065 --> 18:57.707
motherhood story

18:57.709 --> 18:59.396
that got me a focus group

18:59.397 --> 19:01.081
that said I was too arrogant.

19:01.083 --> 19:02.625
- Those two things
- are not connected.

19:02.629 --> 19:04.373
Results are still the same.

19:04.375 --> 19:06.373
Okay.

19:06.375 --> 19:08.208
- You want me to say
- I was wrong about the story?

19:08.212 --> 19:09.624
No.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.081
I was wrong.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.147
If the focus groups

19:12.148 --> 19:13.207
are gonna take me down,

19:13.208 --> 19:15.146
I want to go down

19:15.147 --> 19:17.081
on my own terms, okay?

19:17.083 --> 19:18.332
I've been a good team player,

19:18.333 --> 19:20.582
and where has that gotten me?

19:20.583 --> 19:23.250
- I've given up too much of what
- I want in the Talk Back segment,

19:23.253 --> 19:25.208
- But I've... I've finally
- figured out what direction

19:25.212 --> 19:26.332
I want to take the show.

19:26.333 --> 19:28.397
Great.

19:28.398 --> 19:30.457
Then say it in the meeting.

19:30.458 --> 19:31.959
I was wrong about that.

19:31.960 --> 19:33.457
I'm sorry.

19:33.458 --> 19:34.938
Look, Kara, we are still gonna

19:34.939 --> 19:36.415
be hitting them hard

19:36.417 --> 19:38.248
on our new stories, okay?

19:38.250 --> 19:39.459
We're still gonna be

19:39.460 --> 19:40.665
cultivating new pundits

19:40.667 --> 19:43.290
and... and field reporters.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.332
But the Talk Back segment?

19:45.333 --> 19:47.501
It's got to be stories

19:47.502 --> 19:49.665
that... that matter to me most:

19:49.667 --> 19:50.959
the black community,

19:50.960 --> 19:52.248
black women,

19:52.250 --> 19:54.834
- and shedding light on stories
- that don't get enough attention.

19:54.837 --> 19:56.916
Wait. All black stories?

19:56.917 --> 19:59.248
Yeah, all black everything.

19:59.250 --> 20:00.647
Are you trying to do the news

20:00.648 --> 20:02.040
or build your brand?

20:02.041 --> 20:03.209
'Cause that's

20:03.210 --> 20:04.373
what it sounds like.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.123
Maybe I am.

20:06.125 --> 20:07.916
Oh.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.772
I am tired

20:09.773 --> 20:11.624
of giving my all to something

20:11.625 --> 20:12.625
and winding up with nothing.

20:12.627 --> 20:14.998
So we're talking about...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.208
- [laughs]
- Never mind.

20:16.210 --> 20:17.124
No, no, no, say it.

20:17.126 --> 20:20.208
No. I'll take it to Greg.

20:21.709 --> 20:23.542
Thank you.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.457
Call Nichelle.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.189
(computerized female voice)

20:36.190 --> 20:37.916
Do you mean Michelle Jackson?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.998
No, I mean...

20:40.000 --> 20:42.291
- [sighs]
- What is Nichelle's last name?

20:42.295 --> 20:43.376
(computerized voice)

20:43.377 --> 20:44.457
Sorry. I don't understand.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.540
Michelle, uh...

20:46.542 --> 20:47.957
Would you like me

20:47.959 --> 20:49.043
to search the Internet

20:49.044 --> 20:50.123
for "telenovela"?

20:50.125 --> 20:53.373
No, um...

20:53.375 --> 20:55.290
Call Nichelle Willis.

20:55.291 --> 20:56.832
Dialing Nichelle Willis.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.083
- Leave a brief message
- at the beep.

21:01.086 --> 21:03.290
Oh no, she didn't. Okay.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.540
[beep]

21:04.542 --> 21:07.207
Hey, girl. It's Mary Jane.

21:07.208 --> 21:09.001
I haven't seen you

21:09.002 --> 21:10.790
since the whole sperm fiasco.

21:10.792 --> 21:12.083
- Yes, that is
- what I'm calling it.

21:12.086 --> 21:13.418
But I miss you,

21:13.419 --> 21:14.749
and I miss our friendship,

21:14.750 --> 21:16.709
- and I'm hoping that we can
- put this behind us

21:16.712 --> 21:18.624
With a laugh and a chuckle.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.855
But, uh, meanwhile,

21:20.856 --> 21:23.081
back at the ranch,

21:23.083 --> 21:24.855
I'm calling to talk business,

21:24.856 --> 21:26.624
so, um,

21:26.625 --> 21:28.084
I'm taking your advice

21:28.085 --> 21:29.540
and doing what you suggested,

21:29.542 --> 21:30.916
and I'm branding myself.

21:30.917 --> 21:33.166
- I'm even willing
- to write the book, if necessary.

21:33.170 --> 21:34.938
You know, speaking engagements,

21:34.939 --> 21:36.707
travel, the whole nine yards.

21:36.709 --> 21:38.396
But, um, I really

21:38.397 --> 21:40.081
just want to talk to you

21:40.083 --> 21:42.123
so we can get a plan together

21:42.125 --> 21:44.750
and you can tell me how much it

21:44.751 --> 21:47.373
costs to retain your services.

21:47.375 --> 21:48.918
You know, but they are...

21:48.919 --> 21:50.457
they are trippin' over here,

21:50.458 --> 21:52.168
and I want to make sure

21:52.169 --> 21:53.874
that I have my next option,

21:53.875 --> 21:55.123
as you like to say.

21:55.125 --> 21:56.918
So I look forward

21:56.919 --> 21:58.707
to talking to you,

21:58.709 --> 22:02.290
connecting.

22:02.291 --> 22:04.290

23:14.792 --> 23:16.564

23:16.565 --> 23:18.332
to meet with other people,

23:18.333 --> 23:19.876
and I think I led you to believe

that the job was yours

when it's not.

- I don't even know

23:38.418 --> 23:41.498
the loss of... of me in your life

23:41.500 --> 23:43.355
is any different

than the loss of you in mine.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.001
Me even calling you

23:47.002 --> 23:48.790
is less about reconnecting

Yes. Yes, you did.

Come on in.

24:23.458 --> 24:24.459
And have a seat.

24:27.709 --> 24:29.415
Kara has already briefed me,

24:29.417 --> 24:31.750
says you want to make Talk Back

24:31.751 --> 24:34.081
Talk Black.

24:34.083 --> 24:37.081
Uh, well, wait a minute.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.688
I was a bit more eloquent

24:38.689 --> 24:40.290
than that.

24:40.291 --> 24:41.665
Really, Mary Jane?

24:41.667 --> 24:43.498
Let's be honest, Greg.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.959
- You've already done
- your focus groups,

24:44.962 --> 24:47.583
- And you've come to
- some conclusions about my value.

24:47.587 --> 24:49.022
You've been... you've been

24:49.023 --> 24:50.457
conducting focus groups

24:50.458 --> 24:52.624
about Mary Jane?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.168
We always conduct

24:54.169 --> 24:55.707
focus groups

24:55.709 --> 24:57.916
on all our shows and talent.

24:57.917 --> 25:00.707
Oh, okay.

25:00.709 --> 25:02.647
Well, I know what I have done

25:02.648 --> 25:04.582
for SNC.

25:04.583 --> 25:05.832
I was hired right behind Mark

25:05.834 --> 25:07.542
as a part of the whole influx

25:07.543 --> 25:09.248
of fresh faces.

25:09.250 --> 25:10.498
Do we have a problem here?

25:10.500 --> 25:12.123
Do we?

25:12.125 --> 25:13.290
I don't know.

25:13.291 --> 25:15.332
I'm sensing a problem.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.790
Really?

25:16.792 --> 25:19.373
I thought that you were happy

25:19.375 --> 25:20.897
about the opportunities that SNC

25:20.898 --> 25:22.415
has been providing you,

25:22.417 --> 25:26.665
a platform and a job.

25:26.667 --> 25:27.957
No problem at all.

25:27.959 --> 25:29.707
It's quite the opposite.

25:29.709 --> 25:31.540
I'm happy for the opportunity

25:31.542 --> 25:33.064
to take more control

25:33.065 --> 25:34.582
over Talk Back,

25:34.583 --> 25:35.917
I mean, especially since we

25:35.918 --> 25:37.248
can focus on the audience

25:37.250 --> 25:39.207
that built its success.

25:39.208 --> 25:41.167
You know, for my show

25:41.168 --> 25:43.125
and the network in general.
