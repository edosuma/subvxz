Cut.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.499
- Who the hell yelled cut?
- I did.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.501
And as Selena's producer,
I can yell cut...

01:24.584 --> 01:25.502
-whenever I please.
-Well I'm the director.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.128
-This is my video.
-I don't care.

01:27.212 --> 01:28.671
-This is ridiculous.
-My love, listen, I need more,

01:28.755 --> 01:30.590
okay? I need more hips,

01:30.673 --> 01:31.758
more sex, more everything.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.219
Damn! This latex is riding up my ass,

01:34.302 --> 01:37.305
the smoke machine's killing my lungs
and the song sucks. No.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.265
-I'm out.
-Like hell you are.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.683
Don't touch me.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.103
Get your ass back back on that set
and finish the video

01:43.186 --> 01:45.188
and this time act like
you actually wanna be here.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.148
I'm sorry,
not that good of an actress.

01:47.232 --> 01:50.068
-Listen to me, you little bitch.
-Okay, it's a nice talk.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.945
Can we take this conversation
elsewhere, please?

01:52.028 --> 01:52.987
Stay out of this, Jamil.

01:53.071 --> 01:56.074
I would! Except you've got
an audience.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.914
You better get yourself together
by the time I get back from my trip

02:02.997 --> 02:04.624
or I swear, I'll make you pay.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.754
See what I have to put up with?

02:15.051 --> 02:16.261
The yacht
of missing music mogul

02:16.344 --> 02:18.012
Jeff "El Jefe" Rodriguez,

02:18.096 --> 02:19.264
of El Jefe records,

02:19.347 --> 02:22.517
has been found floating adrift,
40 miles south of the marina.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.019
While "El Jefe" has been missing
for 16 days,

02:25.103 --> 02:27.772
authorities have yet to confirm
if the body found on board

02:27.856 --> 02:29.023
is indeed his.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.659
-Just you guys?
-Um, yes.

02:39.742 --> 02:41.035
Where the hell is Rosie?

02:41.286 --> 02:42.829
-Dentist. There's a cavity...
-Car broke down.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.874
-Helping Donna with her taxes.
-That was not coordinated, guys.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.918
But, yay, listen, it's gonna be fine.
I'm here, so you're not even gonna...

02:49.335 --> 02:51.171
notice the difference, big guy.
Come here.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.466
-All right, get your stuff. Let's go.
-Let's do this.

03:20.658 --> 03:22.243
Is he... Is that real?

03:25.830 --> 03:28.208
- Wow!
- Very much so.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.753
This El Jefe guy was...
what, missing 16 days?

03:31.836 --> 03:34.172
There is no way
this mummified body is his.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.925
You know, actually, boat out to sea
creates the perfect storm

03:37.008 --> 03:39.844
of conditions to make mummification
possible in just couple of weeks.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.598
- High cabin temperatures.
- Low humidities, steady air flow.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.808
High salt content. Low bacteria.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.519
Yeah, so two weeks
to turn El Jefe into King Tut

03:48.603 --> 03:51.064
puts time of death within the first
48 hours of his trip.

03:51.147 --> 03:53.900
Mitchie, we talking about murder here?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.486
Give me the room.

03:59.113 --> 04:01.032
Yeah, works way better
when Rosie does it, right?

04:01.157 --> 04:02.283
Yeah, don't answer that.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.285
I mean,
maybe he died of natural causes

04:04.369 --> 04:06.704
and drifted to sea until
some fisherman found him.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.748
The boat's GPS system
was manually turned off.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.959
I noticed the communication system
was shot.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.752
Okay, so we are talking sabotage then.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.756
No obvious wounds
with the body in this condition.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.883
So, I'm not gonna be able to give you
a cause of death

04:18.967 --> 04:20.677
until I get him back to the lab.

04:21.135 --> 04:24.889
Black light my world,
get into my zone. My zone!

04:24.973 --> 04:26.224
Anybody smell vinegar?

04:26.307 --> 04:29.060
I smell vinegar, rotten eggs and
everything else that's funky in here.

04:29.143 --> 04:31.938
All right! We need CSI to trace
this boat front to back

04:32.021 --> 04:34.315
and let's get that body
to Magic City, ASAP.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.484
Hey, V, where you going? Hey!

04:39.362 --> 04:40.530
Where the hell is she going?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.157
Took you long enough.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.535
Now, did you just flip on the gumballs
and fly through traffic.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.203
-Joo Joo, wait.
-I just didn't know who to call.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.539
And I never ever never call
the po-po for anything, but you--

04:49.622 --> 04:51.416
Joo Joo, stop talking. Where is he?

04:52.083 --> 04:53.501
-What...
-I'm gonna...

04:53.584 --> 04:55.378
Oh, Villa...

04:59.632 --> 05:00.675
Now don't look at me.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.136
I've been trying to dial him back.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.972
Listen, when Rosie
is out-partying Joo Joo,

05:06.806 --> 05:09.642
-something just ain't right.
-Okay, come on. Let's go.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.312
Let's go. Up, get up. Get up, come on.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.481
Move it now, get up before I arrest
you for being high and stupid.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.817
He's probably not gonna remember
your name tomorrow, anyway. Come on.

05:18.067 --> 05:19.694
Oh, wait. I forgot my--

05:19.777 --> 05:22.196
Whatever you forgot, it's not worth
your life, kitty. Just go.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.489
Rosie, come on. Get up.

05:25.366 --> 05:28.244
-Rosie!
-Don't tell me, he's gone.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.999
Damn! You had to hit him that hard?

05:33.082 --> 05:36.169
Annalise Villa. What up?
Give me a hug. Give me a hug.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.755
Ew, oof, you stink.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.132
Make sure he takes a shower
before stepping out in public,

05:41.215 --> 05:43.468
he smells like hookers
and cheap tequila.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.345
Not cheap, broke...

05:45.428 --> 05:46.804
Flat-ass broke.

06:00.151 --> 06:02.070
Okay. You know, I could run tox.

06:02.153 --> 06:04.155
That's my job. I'm already running it.

06:04.238 --> 06:05.531
Look, with Rosie out sick,
Villa thought you guys

06:05.615 --> 06:08.284
could use an extra hand and
it's my day off. So...

06:08.368 --> 06:10.912
-Okay, then. Make yourself useful.
-Thank you.

06:10.995 --> 06:14.040
I cannot believe
the Jeff El Jefe Rodriguez

06:14.123 --> 06:16.042
-is on our table.
-Wait. You know him?

06:16.125 --> 06:17.377
I mean,

06:17.460 --> 06:19.629
not personally, but
that guy right there,

06:19.712 --> 06:21.255
he's the most hated man
in the music biz.

06:21.339 --> 06:23.257
Really? I thought that honor
went to Justin Bieber.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.218
-Bieber.
-Close, but, no.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.804
El Jefe is notorious for
discovering young talent

06:27.887 --> 06:31.015
and then robbing them blind in
the worst music contracts in history.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.350
Crappy but technically legal.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.520
First, we need to confirm that
this is actually El Jefe. So...

06:35.603 --> 06:36.979
-bicarb-ethanol.
-Bicarb-ethanol.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.440
Yeah, should help us retrieve
those dried-up prints.

06:39.524 --> 06:40.775
Good morning, what's happening?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.778
-What do we got?
-Rosie! I thought you were...

06:44.070 --> 06:45.780
Villa said that you were home, sick.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.616
Well, you heard wrong because
I'm firing on all cylinders.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.411
I'm talking all cylinders.

06:51.577 --> 06:52.620
-Hey, my man, good to see you.
-What's up?

06:52.703 --> 06:53.830
Hey, thanks for helping out, man,

06:53.913 --> 06:55.289
but your services are
no longer needed, all right?

06:55.373 --> 06:57.417
-Yeah, okay.
-Thank you very much. Have a good day.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.876
-See you later.
-Bye.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.378
All right, come on. Let's get to work.

07:00.503 --> 07:01.337
Okay.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.381
So, what are we thinking?
Is this murder or not?

07:03.464 --> 07:05.299
The lab's still trying to find
cause of death.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.052
Look, it's possible the deceased
turned the boat's GPS off.

07:08.511 --> 07:10.721
And, the communication system
corroded on its own.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.890
Yeah, but something just
doesn't smell right to us.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.810
Literally. I mean,
the boat reeked worse than the body.

07:15.893 --> 07:17.728
Food rot. Vinegar.

07:18.771 --> 07:21.232
-Vinegar?
-Yeah, maybe from the spilled wine.

07:21.357 --> 07:22.942
You know, when wine ferments...

07:23.025 --> 07:24.777
I know how wine ferments, Ira.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.112
Okay.

07:27.905 --> 07:29.282
Did you know that vinegar was an acid?

07:29.365 --> 07:30.491
I know.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.535
Wait, are you saying
it could have been used

07:32.618 --> 07:34.662
to sabotage the boat's
communication system?

07:34.745 --> 07:35.746
Makes sense.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.498
Why don't you have
forensics test the antenna?

07:37.582 --> 07:38.875
If it's sabotage, then it's murder.

07:38.958 --> 07:42.378
The victim on the boat was definitely
El Jefe, the prints match.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.173
Rosie, I thought you were taking
a couple of more days off.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.674
No. No can do, Villa. See,

07:46.924 --> 07:50.136
one of the side effects of being taken
for everything you got is,

07:50.303 --> 07:51.888
needing a little thing called,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.015
wait for it, cash.

07:54.098 --> 07:55.558
No. Why don't we talk outside
in private?

07:55.641 --> 07:57.518
No, no, no. Wait.
What are we talking in private for?

07:57.602 --> 07:59.103
No need to talk in private, I mean,

07:59.187 --> 08:02.106
everybody knows that
I got robbed blind, right?

08:02.190 --> 08:03.858
Everybody knows,
Rosie got robbed blind.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.985
You know it, yeah, I know.
You got the memo. Uh-huh.

08:06.068 --> 08:07.487
See it in your eyes too.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.572
You know, maybe I could be

08:09.655 --> 08:11.908
a cautionary tale for my two
little friends right here.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.159
Three words for you guys,

08:13.701 --> 08:14.744
hide your wallets.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.954
Hide the wallets!
I like that.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.122
Hide your wallets.

08:18.206 --> 08:20.082
Rosie, we're gonna find Tawnya, okay?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.417
It's just a matter of time.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.753
And her phone's been disconnected
but Kayla's hasn't

08:23.836 --> 08:25.546
and as soon as she turns her
phone back on,

08:25.796 --> 08:27.048
-we will be able to trace them.
-Okay, that's good news, Villa.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.508
But right now, we're investigating

08:28.591 --> 08:30.801
one of the most hated men
in the music business, so...

08:30.885 --> 08:33.012
-where do we start?
-El Jefe had a girlfriend,

08:33.095 --> 08:34.514
Lena Price, she's on her way here.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.307
The dead rich dude's girl
is coming in?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.601
-You have to let me in on that.
-No.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.145
Villa, Hornstock,
you guys take the girlfriend.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.688
Rosie, you wanna work?

08:42.772 --> 08:44.398
Back to lab, focus on the body.

08:45.107 --> 08:47.276
Why don't you give me a cause of
death? Can you do that?

08:55.159 --> 08:56.577
We are very sorry
for your loss.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.996
Lena, we just need you to fill in
the blanks for us.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.915
Was Jeff on his boat alone?

09:00.998 --> 09:03.084
Damn right he was,
who else would be with him?

09:03.167 --> 09:05.586
I'm sorry, it's Keke, right?
You're Lena's friend.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.505
-Ride or die.
-If you don't shut it...

09:07.838 --> 09:10.508
and let her answer these questions
herself, I'll have you ejected.

09:10.591 --> 09:12.218
Jeff was alone, um...

09:12.301 --> 09:14.011
He liked the solitude on his boat.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.556
It was the only time
he could find peace.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.850
Yeah, I mean, when you're gifted like
Jeff, everyone wants a piece of you.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.477
My bad.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.229
You in the music business too?

09:23.312 --> 09:24.438
Well, I used to dance.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.608
It's actually how Jeff and I met,
on one of his music videos.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.193
It was love at first sight.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.237
Lena, we heard Jeff had
a lot of enemies.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.032
Maybe, you could help narrow down the
list of people who wanted him dead.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.284
Oh, no. There's no list.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.160
Lil V did this.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.870
He murdered Jeff. No doubt.

09:39.954 --> 09:42.206
Lil V? The reggaeton artist?

09:42.498 --> 09:44.792
Lil V and Jeff started
in music together.

09:45.001 --> 09:48.087
-They used to be close.
-Yeah, until Jeff's career took off.

09:48.170 --> 09:51.632
Then Lil V got salty because Jeff
wouldn't let him ride his coattails.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.676
It took years for Lil V
to make it on his own.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.136
And, he never forgave Jeff.

09:55.469 --> 09:56.846
You think he killed him over that?

09:56.929 --> 09:59.390
"Your punk-ass wannabe self
better watch your back."

09:59.473 --> 10:00.349
Excuse me!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.101
"That's why yo' peeps fleeing
like roaches,

10:02.184 --> 10:03.561
"tryin' to get on my label.

10:03.644 --> 10:07.106
"Yo, get in my way, I'll put
your culo en la tierra."

10:07.273 --> 10:08.357
Those are tweets

10:08.441 --> 10:11.193
Lil V sent to Jeff a day before
he left on his yacht.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.618
Looks like we won't be getting
much of this thing

10:18.701 --> 10:19.702
formerly known as the heart.

10:21.412 --> 10:25.291
So, we should probably discuss
the, uh, the elephant in the room.

10:27.668 --> 10:28.878
Rosie. You know
I'm talking about Rosie.

10:28.961 --> 10:31.088
Right. No. It's just, technically,
he's not in the room, so...

10:31.339 --> 10:32.173
Right.

10:32.548 --> 10:34.425
Clearly he's not himself right now.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.011
Look, he's just working through things
his way, okay?

10:37.094 --> 10:39.221
Eventually, he'll find his way
back to being Rosie, trust me.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.265
-Hey!
-Is there a problem?

10:41.349 --> 10:45.061
No. We just went through the victim's
medical records, no red flags,

10:45.144 --> 10:46.854
no pre-existing medical conditions. So...

10:47.063 --> 10:48.898
And we also ran full X-rays,

10:48.981 --> 10:51.567
and there's no evidence of
any existing trauma, so...

10:51.859 --> 10:55.404
And, I'm waiting on tox results
but other than that, we have nada.

10:55.529 --> 10:57.531
All right, thank you for the update.
I can take it from here.

10:57.615 --> 10:58.741
You guys can all go home.

10:59.241 --> 11:00.409
-I'm sorry, what?
-Home?

11:00.534 --> 11:01.619
I haven't paid you guys in two weeks,

11:01.702 --> 11:04.705
I don't expect you to work for free,
so... leave. Vamonos!

11:04.955 --> 11:06.499
-No.
-I said leave!

11:07.917 --> 11:09.627
I'm not a charity case. Go.

11:10.044 --> 11:13.422
First of all, I'm gonna need you
to take the bass out your voice.

11:13.506 --> 11:16.008
Okay? Second of all,
get over yourself, bro.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.010
Nobody thinks you are a charity.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.137
In fact, we're not even here
because of you.

11:20.471 --> 11:23.849
Jeff was murdered, doesn't matter that
he was a douche in real life.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.560
The fact is every victim
deserves closure,

11:26.644 --> 11:29.355
that's why we are here, because
of Jeff, not because of you.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.148
Wow.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.734
Please tell me that is not
what I used to sound like.

11:34.318 --> 11:36.070
Actually, I think that
Pippy does it better.

11:36.153 --> 11:37.279
Yeah, she kinda crushed it.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.824
Beaumont Rosewood, Jr..

11:40.533 --> 11:42.368
A word, please. Now.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.289
Aren't you supposed to be on your
Eat, Pray, Love trip with Gerald?

11:47.373 --> 11:50.292
I came back early and that trip is not
what I wanna talk about.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.837
Well, I don't wanna talk about
what you wanna talk about, so...

11:52.920 --> 11:56.757
So, some trifling bitch
took off with all your money.

11:56.841 --> 11:59.427
That is not an excuse for you
to be recklessly

11:59.510 --> 12:01.762
partying your way to an early grave.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.389
Especially with your heart condition.

12:03.597 --> 12:06.058
So, I guess we are talking about
what I didn't wanna talk about?

12:06.475 --> 12:09.061
The bank accounts that
Tawnya emptied, refillable.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.105
Credit cards, replaceable.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.482
Your broken heart, mendable.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.402
But this life, your life,
is a one-time deal

12:16.485 --> 12:18.404
and, baby, you do not get
to throw that away.

12:18.487 --> 12:19.613
Not for some little tramp.

12:19.697 --> 12:22.783
Well with all due respect, if I decided
to throw my life away,

12:22.867 --> 12:24.535
it's mine to throw, so thank you.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.287
With all due respect,

12:26.370 --> 12:29.915
six months in my womb, a near-fatal
C-section, and decades

12:29.999 --> 12:32.585
of sleepless nights says otherwise.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.670
Hey, I hate to interrupt this

12:34.754 --> 12:37.256
not-as-quiet-as-you-think
family argument that's going on.

12:37.339 --> 12:40.760
Rosie, tox results are in.
You need to see this.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.889
Hey, hold up, real quick, um...

12:44.972 --> 12:46.891
I know you asked me to give you space,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.226
but please remember sibling
code number one.

12:50.478 --> 12:53.647
-Always have each other's back.
-I'm here if you need me.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.024
That's all I'm saying.

12:56.233 --> 12:58.444
Uh, apparently, Jeff was on Digitalis.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.573
Yeah, and based on the results,
he's been taking it for a while.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.784
Looks like he's suffering
from atrial fibrillation.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.452
Why wasn't that
in his medical records?

13:06.535 --> 13:07.787
Maybe, he was keeping a secret.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.206
The music industry
can be very cutthroat.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.917
And El Jefe did like
that people were afraid of him.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.419
And a defective heart could make
him vulnerable to his enemies.

13:15.711 --> 13:16.879
Okay, guys, come on.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.131
That is a little bit of a stretch,
this is the music industry,

13:19.215 --> 13:20.049
it's not the mob.

13:20.132 --> 13:23.260
Tara, people will always take
advantage of any sign of weakness.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.013
And the faster you learn that,
the better a life you'll lead.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.264
Okay.

13:27.348 --> 13:30.226
If it, you know, looks like
Rosie and it walks like Rosie,

13:30.309 --> 13:32.645
but it doesn't sound... I'm sorry.

13:33.270 --> 13:35.272
Maybe someone who knew about
Jeff's heart condition

13:35.356 --> 13:37.733
gave him something on that boat
that would trigger a cardiac event,

13:37.817 --> 13:39.819
hoping that it'd make it look
like he died of natural causes.

13:39.902 --> 13:40.778
I need to call Villa.

13:40.861 --> 13:44.782
Villa might be a little too busy
to answer her phone right now.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.908
Breaking news!

13:45.991 --> 13:49.203
Shots have been fired inside
the home of Reggaeton artist, Lil V.

13:49.286 --> 13:52.832
Victor Rivera, you need to stand down.
You're surrounded.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.255
I'm thinking he is in the family room.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.757
I'm glad to see things
are going smoothly without me.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.050
Rosie, you can't be here.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.760
This little punk already
shot at us once.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.012
You need to move back or you
need to put a vest on.

14:07.805 --> 14:08.806
- I'm recording this live...
- Is he...

14:08.889 --> 14:12.142
Yeah, dumb enough to live chat
his standoff with the police?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.561
It seems so.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.729
...know what it is.
They trying to set me up.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.940
A'ight, look, so I ain't
leaving the crib

14:18.232 --> 14:19.859
until my lawyers get here.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.903
Okay? Get here right now!
I'm not playin' with you all...

14:22.987 --> 14:24.572
Okay, Hornstock,
where are we on finding another

14:24.655 --> 14:26.657
-access point to this house?
-Wait a minute, wait, wait.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.076
-So what's his lawyer's name?
-I don't know.

14:29.702 --> 14:34.039
No, no, no, it's that famous guy.
Um, Bernstein? Bender?

14:34.123 --> 14:36.750
All right, listen, Lil V didn't
shoot his gun at you guys.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.210
I'm gonna go inside and prove it.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.962
-Okay, Rosie, just hang on a second.
-Hey, Villa, listen,

14:40.045 --> 14:42.756
I'm not trying to
die on national TV. I got this.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.092
-Let me go inside.
-Wait, okay, here are the rules,

14:45.175 --> 14:48.762
I'll take your six, you talk at
the front door. No entry.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.723
-Got it?
-No entry.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.729
Everybody, he's fine,
just let him through.

14:57.021 --> 14:57.897
Keep him covered.

15:01.817 --> 15:05.112
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.405
Eyes up.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.158
Victor!

15:10.200 --> 15:11.994
Victor, Bender sent me.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.874
Oh, word? Lockstein and Bender
sending brothers now?

15:19.335 --> 15:21.295
Rosie! Don't go inside!

15:21.879 --> 15:23.797
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Hey, whoa, wait.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.300
You just can't be barging up
on my house, man. Who are you?

15:27.343 --> 15:30.137
Beaumont Rosewood, Jr..
I'm a private pathologist.

15:30.638 --> 15:32.932
I don't care what that is?
You need to bounce, man.

15:33.015 --> 15:34.224
The fact that I'm in here is
the only thing

15:34.308 --> 15:35.976
keeping the police from
lighting this place up.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.144
Let that sink in.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.520
I gotta say, I saw that comin'.

15:38.604 --> 15:40.147
Yeah, well, at least
he dialed us in.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.316
Yeah, well, I hope he knows
what he's doin'.

15:42.399 --> 15:44.693
You see anything
that makes us nervous, we go in hard.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.113
I'm trying to save your life, but to
do that I'm gonna need two things.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.450
First, stop live FaceStreaming
your every damn thought.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.077
Yeah, it's stupid and
you look stupid doing it.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.079
Yo, my fans need to know
the truth, man,

15:55.162 --> 15:56.246
'cause everything that
happened to me--

15:56.330 --> 15:58.332
Second, I'm trying to keep
your ass out of jail.

15:58.415 --> 16:00.209
-Yo!
-Where's your gun?

16:01.293 --> 16:03.462
Look, I know you didn't
shoot at the cops.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.131
I noticed this bullet hole
in your gold record

16:06.215 --> 16:07.383
when you were live FaceStreaming.

16:07.466 --> 16:08.759
If you were shooting at the cops,

16:08.842 --> 16:10.594
the bullet hole would've been
much closer to the door.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.596
The gun went off accidentally,
didn't it?

16:14.932 --> 16:17.351
Okay, look, I don't...
I don't have a permit for the gun.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.561
When I heard Five-O,

16:19.645 --> 16:21.355
I tried to hide it before
letting them in.

16:22.064 --> 16:24.024
Look, I dropped it and
it went off when it hit the ground.

16:24.108 --> 16:25.609
Look, I got sweaty palms, man.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.236
I know. You have palmar hyperhidrosis.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.738
I'm already on probation
for couple of DUIs

16:29.822 --> 16:32.616
on a Segway. My lawyers said
keep my nose clean, man.

16:32.700 --> 16:34.910
Well, having an illegal gun
is not keeping your nose clean.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.412
Look, I need it for protection.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.288
You heard what happened to El Jefe.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.125
I did and that's actually what we are
here to talk to you about.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.003
What, you...
You think I killed Jeff?

16:44.086 --> 16:46.296
Well, there was that Twitter beef
over you stealing his artists.

16:46.380 --> 16:49.633
It was one artist and it was
my girlfriend, Selena Monet.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.802
Look, El Jefe was stealing
all her money

16:51.885 --> 16:53.137
and stifling her creativity.

16:53.220 --> 16:55.097
I wouldn't go sit there and
just let that happen.

16:55.180 --> 16:56.140
Well, see, here's the thing.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.183
Saving your girl while
getting back at your rival?

16:58.684 --> 17:00.102
Sounds like a clear motive to me.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.062
You did it, didn't you?

17:02.730 --> 17:03.647
Where's the gun?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.441
Okay, got it, thanks.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.401
Lil V's alibi checked out.

17:07.484 --> 17:08.902
I told you I was innocent.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.321
-Hey, watch the car.
-Watch my chains.

17:11.530 --> 17:12.948
He was giving a private concert

17:13.032 --> 17:15.534
at some Chinese princess'
Sweet 16 in Hong Kong.

17:15.617 --> 17:18.078
So, all we have him on is an illegal
possession of a firearm

17:18.162 --> 17:20.122
-and nothing else?
-What about Selena Monet?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.999
It was her money that
El Jefe was messing with,

17:22.082 --> 17:24.376
so maybe she figured out another
way to get out of her contract.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.212
She was El Jefe's biggest artist and
they did spend a lot of time together,

17:27.296 --> 17:28.172
which means--

17:28.255 --> 17:30.299
She could've figured out,
Jeff had a bad heart.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.009
Found the best way to get rid of him.

17:32.092 --> 17:34.553
Why don't you guys go find this Selena
girl? I'll finish things up here.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.637
Okay.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.931
A'ight, yo, I told y'all, man,
I was innocent.

17:38.515 --> 17:40.184
Wait till my real lawyer get here,

17:40.267 --> 17:42.061
instead of the fake one
that showed up.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.608
Five, six, seven, eight.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.568
One, two, three, four,

17:49.651 --> 17:51.528
five, six, seven, eight.

17:51.612 --> 17:53.280
And two, two, three, four...

17:53.655 --> 17:57.826
♪ Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison ♪

17:58.243 --> 17:59.661
Oh, no, no, no.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.038
This is a private rehearsal,
y'all gotta leave.

18:01.121 --> 18:02.706
Detective Villa, East Miami PD.

18:02.790 --> 18:04.416
We are here about the murder
of Jeff Rodriguez.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.168
We'd like to talk to Selena
for a minute.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.046
-Damon, take five.
-Sure thing.

18:13.258 --> 18:16.095
Come on, girl. If you were grinding on
a guy who looked like him all day,

18:16.178 --> 18:18.680
-you'd be kissing him too.
-I thought you were dating Lil V.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.391
I mean, I wouldn't exactly
call it dating, he serves a purpose.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.435
An equal opportunity user.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.187
Well, that's honest. I like it.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.815
Have you guys found Jeff's killer?

18:27.898 --> 18:28.899
I'm sorry, who are you?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.984
Jamil, Selena's choreographer.

18:31.276 --> 18:32.402
Jeff was also a friend of mine.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.322
Jeff didn't have any friends,
just people that he used.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.241
And you're too damn loyal to see that.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.159
Jeff kept the bullies off my ass
when we were growing up.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.494
It's not easy being the gay kid

18:40.577 --> 18:42.371
who loves to dance
when you live in Biloxi.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.705
I owe him for that.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.582
And Jeff's been playing
on your gratitude

18:45.666 --> 18:48.585
his whole career, by getting you
to choreograph for next to nothing.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.587
You don't seem particularly upset
that Jeff is dead.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.381
Jeff was a manipulative ass.

18:52.714 --> 18:55.134
Where were you January 2nd and 3rd?

18:55.384 --> 18:58.804
Look, I didn't kill him,
would have loved to. But I didn't.

18:59.805 --> 19:02.099
If you have any other questions,
you can call my lawyer.

19:02.224 --> 19:05.102
Jamil, get Damian back. Break's over.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.397
She didn't give us an alibi.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.941
♪ Poison! ♪

19:18.532 --> 19:19.867
You Rosewood?

19:21.201 --> 19:23.078
Leland? Thanks for coming.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.790
In cash, just like you asked.

19:28.167 --> 19:29.084
It's all there.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.712
Can't trust people these days.

19:33.714 --> 19:35.174
Pleasure doing business
with you, brother.

19:35.257 --> 19:36.466
I'm not your brother.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.101
Who was that
serial killer-looking fool?

19:46.185 --> 19:49.271
My wingman is here, Joo Joo's in
the house.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.649
Hey, everybody, time to get
this party started!

19:52.733 --> 19:54.526
Come on, now. Started!

19:54.610 --> 19:57.321
Hey, Marcus. Hey, let me get a glass
for my man right here.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.864
Joo Joo is in the house.

20:00.032 --> 20:02.409
Hey, looks like you've partied enough
for the day,

20:02.492 --> 20:03.493
let me get you home, man.

20:03.785 --> 20:05.412
Okay, so, what,
you calling the shots now?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.164
Negro, please.

20:07.915 --> 20:10.042
Hey, you my boy, so I'm-a let
that slide just once,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.461
-but don't push me.
-Okay, so now I'm your boy, huh?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.006
Come on, man.
Don't act like we both don't know

20:16.089 --> 20:17.382
why you pretend to be my friend.

20:17.674 --> 20:20.093
Just another brother
for Joo Joo to mooch off of.

20:21.428 --> 20:24.139
Just mooching. No, no, no, it's cool,
'cause you know what it's like?

20:24.598 --> 20:25.849
It's kind of like your super power.

20:25.933 --> 20:28.936
You can benefit off of anybody
in any state of mind.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.104
As long as I'm running around town
running up tabs,

20:31.188 --> 20:32.606
keeping the party going,

20:32.689 --> 20:35.567
you willing to hang with me,
be with me, really be my boy, huh?

20:35.651 --> 20:37.027
Negro, please, get up out of here.

20:38.111 --> 20:42.741
Yo, real talk? I'm here...

20:43.700 --> 20:46.036
'cause it's obvious your ass
can't be alone right now.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.498
I was trying to be
a good friend, but...

20:50.207 --> 20:51.750
-my bad.
-Yeah, okay, yeah.

20:51.833 --> 20:55.545
Because clearly, you don't need
no friends, do you?

20:55.629 --> 20:56.838
Your bad.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.054
Marcus, I wanna close out, man.

21:05.222 --> 21:07.557
Appreciate you letting me
run up this tab all week.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.561
There's no tab, man. Your boy
Joo Joo's been paying for everything.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.782
Bro, it's midnight.
What are you doing here?

21:23.865 --> 21:25.200
I couldn't sleep, you?

21:25.617 --> 21:28.787
Well, outside of music,
I don't have a life, so...

21:28.870 --> 21:32.624
-I thought that you and TMI were--
-Just a post-break up slip up,

21:32.708 --> 21:35.419
and I don't feel like dissecting that,
so... What you got there?

21:35.961 --> 21:38.088
Everyone's pay for the last two weeks.
There's yours.

21:39.715 --> 21:40.882
In cash?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.468
Bro, where did you get this money?

21:43.552 --> 21:46.263
And why do you smell like a frat boy
on spring break?

21:46.346 --> 21:49.266
-What do we got here?
-I'm gonna circle back to this cash.

21:49.516 --> 21:52.352
I re-swabbed the mouth because
one of the results was inconclusive.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.937
-So you're retesting?
-Mm-hmm.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.315
-Did you do the--
-Mouth, esophagus, under the tongue,

21:56.398 --> 21:57.399
around the cheeks.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.608
Oh.

22:00.736 --> 22:04.031
Boom. There were two sets of DNA found
in the victim's mouth.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.950
So it turns out El Jefe wasn't
on the boat alone after all.

22:07.367 --> 22:11.079
So our victim was a liar and a cheat.
Say it isn't so.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.540
So who's Jeff's chick on the side?

22:15.250 --> 22:16.877
Well, try man on the side.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.588
Chase Austin. And he has
his very own assault record.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.302
Chase, do you mind if we
tell you a little bit about yourself?

22:25.385 --> 22:28.305
You used to cut hair for a living.
Me? I don't have a hair guy.

22:28.388 --> 22:31.558
You had your own salon
that shut down after only six months?

22:31.641 --> 22:33.894
When times were rough,
and your scissors were on ice,

22:33.977 --> 22:37.105
you got into a few bar brawls,
got arrested a couple of times.

22:38.106 --> 22:39.232
Then you met Jeff.

22:39.316 --> 22:41.151
A rich, powerful celebrity

22:41.234 --> 22:43.070
living the sweet life, yeah?

22:43.153 --> 22:44.529
You were able
to live the sweet life, too.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.698
Once you started
your little secret affair.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.076
-Jeff and I were just--
-Don't say just friends.

22:49.159 --> 22:50.994
Look, we found your DNA
on Jeff's lips.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.038
That's this general area right here.

22:53.121 --> 22:54.331
I know where the lips are.

22:54.664 --> 22:56.750
Jeff had a certain reputation.

22:56.833 --> 22:58.668
And let's just say
that in his industry,

22:58.752 --> 23:01.755
him being gay
wouldn't have helped his empire.

23:01.838 --> 23:03.715
-So--
-So you kept it a secret?

23:04.966 --> 23:07.094
You wanted to tell the whole world
and he didn't?

23:07.177 --> 23:10.263
An argument erupts out at sea,
you kill him,

23:10.347 --> 23:13.141
then take the jet ski,
hitched to the back of the boat.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.395
-And Bob's your uncle.
-No, I never killed Jeffrey.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.979
I loved what we had together.

23:18.063 --> 23:19.606
This dude loved his ass some money.

23:19.689 --> 23:22.317
He loved sliding his ass
into private jets,

23:22.401 --> 23:24.194
loved washing his ass with gold bidets

23:24.277 --> 23:26.613
and right now he is lying his ass off.

23:27.531 --> 23:29.991
Um, what is happening
with you right now?

23:30.075 --> 23:31.910
I know people like Chase.

23:32.285 --> 23:34.913
Okay? What they do is they lock on
to a mark, they enjoy the ride

23:34.996 --> 23:36.706
till it's time to jump to the next.

23:36.915 --> 23:38.417
And who are we talking about here?

23:38.500 --> 23:41.044
Well, we're talking about Chase
not being our killer.

23:41.128 --> 23:42.712
What? What makes you say that?

23:42.796 --> 23:43.713
Look, if I wasn't broke,

23:43.797 --> 23:46.425
I would bet all my money that
it was Jeff that wanted to come out

23:46.508 --> 23:50.053
and this leach is the one that didn't
want that to happen. You know why?

23:51.346 --> 23:53.014
Because it would jeopardize
Jeff's empire?

23:53.098 --> 23:54.516
Which would hurt his bank accounts.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.353
Jeff was the one
who wanted to come out, not me.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.063
It could've ruined his career.

24:00.856 --> 24:03.775
I dug him, but I loved our lifestyle.

24:05.068 --> 24:06.278
Really loved it.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.155
Boom! See. Ha, ha! I told you.

24:08.238 --> 24:11.450
You little greedy bastard, I told you.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.913
Look, we got into a huge argument
that night on the boat.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.374
We cut our vacation short, came back,
I got off the boat,

24:19.458 --> 24:23.962
and I never saw him again. I swear
to you, he was fine when I left.

24:24.045 --> 24:26.798
See? So, I guess, we just gonna let
Chase back out on to the streets

24:26.882 --> 24:28.633
to lock in
on his next meal ticket, huh?

24:29.885 --> 24:30.969
I told you, told you.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.975
Rosie.

24:37.893 --> 24:38.768
How can I help you?

24:39.478 --> 24:41.104
You can't, I don't need help. Donut?

24:41.438 --> 24:42.439
No, I'm good.

24:42.522 --> 24:44.608
Hey, um, just step into my office.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.654
Have a seat.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.829
You wanna know where I've lived
a good chunk of my adult life?

24:58.121 --> 24:58.997
A boat?

25:01.041 --> 25:02.042
Rock-bottom.

25:02.876 --> 25:06.296
'Cause I don't have faith in anything,
especially people.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.549
You see, people have
this natural instinct

25:09.633 --> 25:11.635
to become part of a tribe, right?

25:11.927 --> 25:16.389
Commonly referred to as family or
friends, but it's still just a tribe.

25:17.307 --> 25:18.308
Not me.

25:18.683 --> 25:19.851
You're looking at my tribe.

25:20.685 --> 25:24.606
Me, alone, you know why?

25:26.149 --> 25:27.609
I don't know,
'cause your parents didn't want you,

25:27.692 --> 25:29.027
now you don't want anyone either?

25:29.903 --> 25:33.240
And because I say the same thing you
said to me, every time someone offers,

25:33.782 --> 25:34.616
"I don't need help."

25:35.492 --> 25:36.952
All right, I hear you, okay, but--

25:37.035 --> 25:38.328
You don't wanna be me, Rosie.

25:38.411 --> 25:41.289
No roots. No one to call
when you pick up the phone,

25:41.373 --> 25:43.041
trust me, it's not a life.

25:44.751 --> 25:45.585
Okay.

25:46.711 --> 25:51.132
Well, I'm not one to usually offer,
but if you ever need to vent

25:51.216 --> 25:54.427
or you need money that
you never have to pay back,

25:54.511 --> 25:55.679
you just say the word.

25:56.721 --> 25:59.266
My old man left me plenty
out of guilt,

25:59.349 --> 26:01.518
but I have no intentions of using it.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.897
Hey, I'm good on money now,
but thanks.

26:08.775 --> 26:10.944
Talk to me, Villa.

26:11.152 --> 26:14.447
I'm gonna keep Chase on a 24 hour hold
until I can officially clear him.

26:14.531 --> 26:15.574
And my next stop--

26:15.657 --> 26:17.492
Questioning Lena,
the lying girlfriend.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.160
Because if El Jefe wanted to come out,

26:19.244 --> 26:23.123
he won't need her masquerading as his
fake video ho girlfriend anymore.

26:23.206 --> 26:24.791
Which means
she could be discarded like trash

26:24.874 --> 26:27.002
which sounds like
a clear motive to me.

26:27.085 --> 26:28.461
You know, I don't like
this new look on you.

26:28.545 --> 26:31.006
Well, you better learn to like
the new look on me, okay, Villa?

26:31.089 --> 26:33.258
'Cause I'm gonna be riding shotgun
in your new car for a while.

26:33.341 --> 26:34.175
My car, why?

26:35.635 --> 26:36.636
'Cause I sold the GTO.

26:42.976 --> 26:45.520
Okay, Rosie. Let me ease
our way into this interrogation.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.688
You're burning a bit hot.

26:46.771 --> 26:49.774
Relax, Villa, relax. I'm coming
into this interrogation

26:49.858 --> 26:52.527
with an overly optimistic
Rosie point of view.

26:52.611 --> 26:56.156
I hope Lena has an amazing explanation
that rings true and sincere.

26:56.239 --> 26:58.950
But if I'm right about her being
a money-devouring succubus--

26:59.034 --> 27:00.035
-Succubus?
-Yes, succubus.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.995
A money-devouring succubus.

27:02.078 --> 27:05.498
I want you guys all to step back
and let me grow into my new look.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.876
Lena, sorry to bother you.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.919
I'm Doc Rosewood. This is Cop Villa.

27:10.003 --> 27:10.837
Hi.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.547
I need you to help us
clear some things out.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.341
For sure, sure, anything.

27:14.674 --> 27:17.218
Actually, what we need to know is
are you a loyal lady

27:17.302 --> 27:20.513
who loved Jeff for the man he was
or are you a succ--

27:22.390 --> 27:23.892
Are you an expensive beard

27:23.975 --> 27:25.977
who killed Jeff because
he didn't need you anymore?

27:26.269 --> 27:27.687
And... go.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.399
I'm sorry, maybe she's deaf
in one ear.

27:31.483 --> 27:32.609
Let's try this one more time.

27:32.692 --> 27:33.985
And... go.

27:34.069 --> 27:35.195
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:35.278 --> 27:38.865
Look, we know Jeff was gay
and he was seeing someone else.

27:40.325 --> 27:43.036
You know, Jeff plucked me
out of obscurity.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.705
He gave me a job and a life.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.958
Put my mother in one of the best
retirement homes in the country.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.628
In return, he asked for my word
and I gave it to him.

27:52.128 --> 27:54.798
So everyone sees Jeff
as this ruthless businessman,

27:54.881 --> 27:57.008
but to me, he was a savior.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.719
You wanna drag me down to the station,
then just do it.

27:59.969 --> 28:00.887
But I'll be damned if I stand here

28:00.970 --> 28:03.431
and let you accuse me
of killing someone that I loved.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.934
Good, bad, or ugly,
I was on the ride with him.

28:08.812 --> 28:10.438
-You have a "light bulb" face.
-I do.

28:11.231 --> 28:13.358
Maybe Kayla was feeling that
about Tawnya.

28:13.566 --> 28:16.236
Maybe she's just being loyal.
Maybe she needs someone to save her.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.781
Lena, I'm sorry for your loss.

28:22.784 --> 28:25.078
Hey, it's Kayla.
Guess I'm kind of busy right now.

28:25.161 --> 28:28.456
But leave me a message
and I'll get back to you. Promise.

28:29.958 --> 28:31.876
Hey, it's Rosie.

28:33.753 --> 28:35.463
I'm not sure if you're still
checking this phone,

28:35.547 --> 28:37.507
but I want you to come see me.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.342
Just want to make sure you're okay.

28:40.468 --> 28:43.888
And if you're not, I'm here, okay?

28:43.972 --> 28:46.307
And that's all I care about,

28:46.391 --> 28:48.518
is, uh... is that you're okay. So...

28:48.977 --> 28:50.228
come see me, okay?

28:55.692 --> 28:59.779
You know, I had many meals from
this machine, I don't recommend it.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.532
It's late, what are you
still doing here?

29:02.615 --> 29:05.410
I didn't see Tawnya coming.
I just missed it.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.829
I mean, how did I miss it?

29:08.496 --> 29:10.248
Because you wanted to see Rosie happy.

29:10.623 --> 29:12.542
Because you had
no reason to suspect her.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.169
None of us did.

29:15.211 --> 29:16.254
No, we failed him.

29:16.713 --> 29:18.423
Maybe, I don't know.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.508
But, Villa, he's gonna be okay.

29:26.181 --> 29:27.182
Rosie.

29:29.934 --> 29:32.228
-Kayla.
-I was hoping you'd call.

29:32.312 --> 29:33.605
My name's not really Kayla.

29:33.855 --> 29:37.442
And everything you know
about me is a lie.

29:43.865 --> 29:45.992
-What's your real name?
-Yonce McGill.

29:46.284 --> 29:49.120
I'm 22, and obviously,
I'm not Tawnya's daughter.

29:49.204 --> 29:50.246
Obviously.

29:50.330 --> 29:54.209
-Look, I can't sit here and apologize.
-Well, it's a great start.

29:54.292 --> 29:55.460
Such a great start.

29:55.543 --> 29:56.961
You wanna hear about great starts?

29:57.587 --> 29:59.339
I've been on my own since I was ten.

29:59.422 --> 30:02.383
Every day in these shoes
is a fight to survive.

30:02.467 --> 30:06.137
You were just my next path
to a warm bed, a decent meal,

30:06.846 --> 30:09.390
not having to sell myself
to a stranger.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.643
And am I sorry for that, no.

30:11.726 --> 30:15.480
But what I am sorry for
is... hurting someone like you.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.774
Hurting a family like yours.

30:18.942 --> 30:21.528
Hey, got your text.
I can take it from here.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.573
I know it's crazy, but part of me
wanted to keep going.

30:25.657 --> 30:29.953
Live the lie, because I never felt
so safe, you know?

30:30.036 --> 30:32.539
I never had someone like you
look out for me.

30:32.622 --> 30:33.873
And I didn't want that to end.

30:35.124 --> 30:36.876
So I walked away from Tawnya.

30:37.794 --> 30:38.837
You did what?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.463
I didn't take a dime of your money.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.674
The last time I saw you
outside the police station,

30:42.757 --> 30:44.592
I told Tawnya I was out.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.387
We got into it
and we went our separate ways.

30:47.720 --> 30:49.514
Yeah, you fool me twice, shame on me.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.641
I'm being straight with you.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.518
And I'm gonna change my life.

30:53.977 --> 30:55.895
Now that I know there's another way.

30:55.979 --> 30:56.980
A better way.

31:07.448 --> 31:10.076
Thank you. Thank you so much.

31:12.078 --> 31:12.954
Book her.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.790
-Hey, are you serious?
-Book her.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.835
Rosie! Rosie, wait, please!

31:19.335 --> 31:21.754
Please, Rosie!
Please, don't leave! Please!

31:22.422 --> 31:23.464
Rosie!

31:31.556 --> 31:35.560
I talked to Hornstock, I heard
about the Kayla situation. How is he?

31:36.728 --> 31:40.189
He's gonna be okay, he just needs
some time to clear his head.

31:40.857 --> 31:43.276
Miss D, let me...
Let me take this round.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.613
-Thank you, but I'm--
-I've got this one. I promise.

31:59.208 --> 32:01.336
Wanna hear something
kind of embarrassing?

32:03.963 --> 32:06.215
When I am pissed off at the world,

32:06.716 --> 32:11.512
or I'm upset or it just
hurts to move, I...

32:12.972 --> 32:16.309
I shake my arms and my body,
a little like this.

32:16.726 --> 32:21.189
Like I'm shaking it off, right? And
then I just scream, top of my lungs.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.399
-From here, from my core.
-No, you don't. Don't.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.950
Come on, try it.

32:32.492 --> 32:33.910
I'm not the screaming type, yeah.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.078
-But you could be. Come on, come on.
-No.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.913
Just try it. It just takes
a little bit--

32:37.121 --> 32:37.997
No!

32:39.707 --> 32:42.085
Okay, so what, you're gonna give
me the halftime speech now?

32:42.502 --> 32:45.171
About how I should go back
to being the same old Rosie?

32:46.714 --> 32:48.549
Rosie, I love you no matter what.

32:49.258 --> 32:53.471
But this kind of stress
mixed with no sleep,

32:54.097 --> 32:56.975
and a decent amount of alcohol
means what?

32:58.267 --> 32:59.894
For a guy with two holes in his heart?

33:00.353 --> 33:01.604
Your third stroke?

33:01.688 --> 33:03.856
Organ failure? An aneurysm?

33:03.940 --> 33:06.234
You're not taking care of yourself.

33:07.193 --> 33:09.654
And that... That scares me...

33:10.530 --> 33:11.531
to death.

33:12.865 --> 33:15.785
And what you're doing, it hurts me.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.832
And if that doesn't mean
anything to you, then...

33:22.917 --> 33:24.502
by all means, do whatever you want.

33:32.510 --> 33:33.344
I'm gonna be okay.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.391
Just need a little time.
A little space.

33:40.059 --> 33:40.893
I'll be okay.

33:49.485 --> 33:52.739
And stop taking it out on your plants.
What did they do to you?

33:53.239 --> 33:55.408
-Baking powder and Epsom salt.
-For what?

33:55.491 --> 33:56.659
It's an old wives' tale.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.121
I need both to bring this poor thing
back to life.

34:05.835 --> 34:08.671
I've got a crazy idea.

34:10.298 --> 34:11.591
I'm so angry at you.

34:12.467 --> 34:14.218
Not angry, I'm frustrated.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.013
And you know what?
It's not your fault.

34:17.096 --> 34:18.097
Who are you talking to?

34:18.639 --> 34:20.224
We're rehydrating the body.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.644
Yes? Oh, yes, get down here, Rosie,

34:23.728 --> 34:24.937
if you're the real Rosie.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.106
My bro is back, right? Hopefully.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.233
Wait, did you say rehydrating?

34:29.317 --> 34:30.318
That's what I said.

34:30.401 --> 34:34.280
And our shopping list is glycerin,
sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate

34:34.363 --> 34:37.492
human serum and a lot
of fabric softener. Go!

34:37.575 --> 34:39.285
-I think I remember fabric softener.
-Go!

34:39.368 --> 34:41.871
Roseman, post-mortem rehydration
is theoretical.

34:41.954 --> 34:45.416
It's the musings of a witch doctor
named Horatio Adler in an article

34:45.500 --> 34:48.211
that never ever should've been
written or published.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.046
Pretty sure he's not even
a real doctor.

34:50.129 --> 34:52.381
Really, that's interesting
because I am Horatio Adler.

34:52.632 --> 34:55.009
Yes, it's a pseudonym that I use
for certain medical journals.

34:55.093 --> 34:57.637
That makes so much sense.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.223
That makes no sense.

35:00.306 --> 35:01.557
-Wait, really?
-No.

35:01.641 --> 35:04.143
But since we've exhausted
all our other options,

35:04.227 --> 35:05.520
it's Hail Mary time.

35:05.603 --> 35:09.357
And if we're successful at rehydrating
this body, then guess what we'll see?

35:09.440 --> 35:10.900
-Body marks.
-Body marks!

35:10.983 --> 35:12.777
-Body marks.
-Body marks.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.237
-Let's go! Let's do this! Come on!
-All right!

Unbelievable.

36:09.375 --> 36:11.419
I really didn't think
that was gonna work.

36:13.212 --> 36:14.505
Hey, are those prong marks?

36:15.131 --> 36:16.507
Jeff was tasered.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.134
And that's what stopped his heart.

36:18.217 --> 36:19.760
You know what?
Can we flip the body real quick?

36:19.844 --> 36:22.388
One, two, careful, careful.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.184
Yeah, that looks like
drag marks to me.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.269
-Dragged from where?
-Give me the forceps, please.

36:38.154 --> 36:39.405
Is that wood?

36:41.032 --> 36:42.158
You know what I'm thinking?

36:42.241 --> 36:45.036
I'm thinking El Jefe was tasered
as he got off the boat,

36:45.119 --> 36:48.039
dragged back on board,
then taken off to sea,

36:48.122 --> 36:51.000
and then the killer
took the missing jet ski

36:51.083 --> 36:54.295
and rode it back to shore.
Right, Rosie?

36:55.463 --> 36:56.631
Uh...

36:56.714 --> 36:58.799
Do I need to say what I said again,
so that you actually hear it?

36:58.883 --> 37:00.384
Villa, it's quiet time.

37:00.468 --> 37:05.306
Quiet time. Quiet time? Okay.
Wow. So I'm a child now?

37:05.389 --> 37:07.058
Wow. Should I sit in a time-out,

37:07.141 --> 37:08.768
-so that you could--
-No, I got it.

37:08.851 --> 37:10.144
Right down there.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.439
The marks on Jeff's body
span from his head to his shoulders

37:13.689 --> 37:14.565
to the lower back.

37:14.649 --> 37:17.443
That tells me that he was dragged
more than just a few feet.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.947
-You recognize that?
-Taser confetti.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.740
It's discharged when you fire the gun.

37:22.823 --> 37:23.741
And confetti is...

37:23.824 --> 37:24.909
Traceable, which means...

37:24.992 --> 37:27.453
This little guy is gonna lead us
right to our killer.

37:31.123 --> 37:33.417
Jamil, do you recognize
this little guy here?

37:34.252 --> 37:35.336
-Huh?
-No.

37:35.419 --> 37:36.504
No?

37:37.672 --> 37:38.756
Hmm.

37:39.507 --> 37:40.466
Thank you.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.686
I gotta say, I love confetti.

37:51.894 --> 37:53.813
Jamil, we know you bought
your taser cartridges

37:53.896 --> 37:56.649
from the Big Boy sports store
over in El Dorado street.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.942
Same place I get my tennis rackets.

37:58.025 --> 38:00.987
Rosie is not good at tennis
and you, Jamil,

38:01.070 --> 38:03.030
are not good at
getting away with murder.

38:03.656 --> 38:07.743
Look, someone stole my taser, okay?
So I don't even know why I--

38:07.827 --> 38:09.203
We got the search warrant,

38:09.287 --> 38:11.330
we found the taser gun
in your apartment, sit down.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.792
What?

38:14.875 --> 38:16.919
Look, I had nothing but love for him.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.629
You mean, you were in love with him?

38:18.921 --> 38:19.755
Oh, God.

38:19.839 --> 38:21.590
Jamil, you and Jeff,
you guys go way back, right?

38:22.008 --> 38:23.467
You guys grew up in Biloxi together?

38:23.551 --> 38:26.637
Then after all these years, your best
friend finally decides to come out--

38:26.721 --> 38:29.932
He did, but it wasn't for you.
It was for Chase.

38:30.016 --> 38:33.185
Jeff gets into an argument
with Chase on the boat--

38:33.269 --> 38:36.272
They return to dry land,
Chase gets off the boat, leaves.

38:36.647 --> 38:38.774
Jeff ties the boat up,
then walks down the dock.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.318
Where you confronted him.

38:40.401 --> 38:43.863
Unable to deal with his constant
rejection of your feelings,

38:43.946 --> 38:44.947
you attacked him.

38:45.031 --> 38:47.074
Look, I didn't... I didn't mean
to kill him, okay?

38:47.491 --> 38:48.743
I was defending myself.

38:48.826 --> 38:50.578
Come on, Jamil, you were one of

38:50.661 --> 38:52.580
the only people to know
of Jeff's heart condition.

38:52.747 --> 38:55.082
So you brought the perfect weapon
to trigger an attack.

38:55.166 --> 38:58.753
After all those years of friendship
and loyalty, you felt cheated.

38:59.295 --> 39:00.379
He should've picked me.

39:03.174 --> 39:04.842
I'm the one who would've
made him happy.

39:07.595 --> 39:09.055
I just needed a chance.

39:09.430 --> 39:11.766
Yeah, well, you would've been
a real catch.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.268
Now you can stand.

39:24.653 --> 39:26.364
Hey, you okay?

39:26.781 --> 39:28.491
Uh, yeah.

39:29.617 --> 39:30.868
Actually, I need a favor.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.840
Told them to drop all the charges
against you.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.136
I don't know why, but I believe you.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.681
I think you're ready to live
a better life and I want that for you.

39:53.682 --> 39:56.143
Here's your chance, don't screw it up.

39:57.770 --> 40:01.732
Is there any way that we could
go back to normal?

40:06.237 --> 40:07.405
No, there isn't.

40:09.365 --> 40:10.282
Goodbye.

40:24.672 --> 40:25.965
Okay, I'm just making sure...

40:27.007 --> 40:29.885
-You good?
-Yeah, yeah. It's all good. All good.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.971
-Thanks for that.
-Any time.

40:32.596 --> 40:34.265
Hey, uh... Hey, man, I know
you're on your way home,

40:34.348 --> 40:36.308
so we got two options on the table.

40:36.392 --> 40:37.935
One of us could give you a lift.

40:38.102 --> 40:39.437
Or we give you a loaner.

40:39.854 --> 40:41.772
Loaner? Does it have a siren?

40:43.232 --> 40:45.443
Well, there's one other option.

40:46.652 --> 40:47.987
Maybe you drive yourself home.

40:53.367 --> 40:57.204
Turns out you're the only one
that can drive a stick, so...

40:57.288 --> 40:58.622
You might need a new clutch.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.084
I don't even know what to say.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.586
And I definitely don't want to know

41:03.669 --> 41:05.671
what you guys paid that greedy bastard
I sold it to.

41:05.754 --> 41:07.381
We got him to rethink his price.

41:07.465 --> 41:10.217
And perhaps even renew his faith
in our good Lord.

41:10.301 --> 41:11.844
She belongs with you, son.

41:11.927 --> 41:14.638
And everyone here pitched in
to make sure that happened.

41:14.722 --> 41:17.558
Oh, yeah, almost everyone.
Not quite everybody.

41:18.309 --> 41:19.310
All right, look, y'all,

41:19.393 --> 41:22.188
all my money, it went to
paying this man's bar tabs

41:22.271 --> 41:23.522
all over town.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.774
Y'all don't know, he can drink
like a fish when he wants to.

41:25.858 --> 41:29.028
-I appreciate you. I owe you a big--
-Hey, hey, hey, say no mas.

41:29.361 --> 41:30.529
No pasa nada.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.866
We straight. You already know.

41:36.535 --> 41:38.245
Yellow Queen!

41:38.621 --> 41:40.164
Who wants to go for a ride?

41:40.247 --> 41:41.290
I'd love one.

41:42.249 --> 41:43.626
- Okay now.
- Hello.

41:44.126 --> 41:45.336
Look at that.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.005
-All right.
-Be good.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.215
Love you guys.

41:49.298 --> 41:50.716
-Love you too.
-Love you, son.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.760
Diddy and J.Lo, off in the sunset.

42:01.060 --> 42:02.770
So how did you know
I'm not good at tennis?

42:02.853 --> 42:05.272
-Are you good at tennis?
-Hell, no, I'm not good at tennis.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.984
Oh, I know you, Rosie.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.694
Almost too well.

42:17.243 --> 42:18.994
You know, it's okay to miss her.

42:19.078 --> 42:20.913
-Is it?
-Yeah.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.749
Because you thought...

42:24.416 --> 42:27.044
what you and Tawnya had was special.

42:27.127 --> 42:31.340
And you went all in,
you put yourself out there.

42:33.217 --> 42:35.844
Look, Rosie, you're not mad
at the world.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.180
You're mad at yourself.

42:39.181 --> 42:42.685
Because part of you still wishes
that what you had was real

42:42.768 --> 42:43.936
and you know what, I get it.

42:46.188 --> 42:47.648
I'd feel the same way.

43:04.415 --> 43:05.499
Oh!

43:06.792 --> 43:08.669
You were supposed to shake
before the scream.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.254
No, I shake after my scream.

43:11.714 --> 43:12.881
That's my shake.
