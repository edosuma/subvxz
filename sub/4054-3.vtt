NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago, an invisible dome

00:05.047 --> 00:06.332
crashed down on Chester's Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.413
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.962
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.090
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.890 --> 00:16.380
Rage,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.681
grief,

00:19.686 --> 00:21.642
- fear.
- My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.431
NARRATOR:
Now in order to survive

00:25.609 --> 00:27.520
we must battle
our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.028 --> 00:30.110
The enemy within.

00:31.615 --> 00:34.778
CHRISTINE: I'm Christine Price.
This is my friend Eva.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.574
JULIA: You were together
what felt like a year.

00:36.745 --> 00:39.407
So I understand
if you still have feelings.

00:39.623 --> 00:41.989
You can't possibly understand
any of this.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.574
- You never went anywhere.
JUNIOR: I did.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.954
I moved on, I got rid of you.

00:46.213 --> 00:47.749
JIM:
You should be thanking me.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.206
Yesterday we were together,
but in the matrix,

00:50.425 --> 00:52.165
you moved on without me.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.260
According to the dark flight
calculations of the meteoroid...

00:55.472 --> 00:57.133
Therapist, my ass.

00:58.976 --> 01:00.967
JIM:
You got that, Malick?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.932
- I'm getting out of here.
JULIA: You're leaving town?

01:04.147 --> 01:05.762
Those people, they're not the same.

01:05.941 --> 01:07.181
They've changed.

01:07.776 --> 01:10.984
I'm right about them, just like
I was right about everything else.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.774
What the hell is that?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.318
What is she?

01:44.938 --> 01:47.975
I'm surprised to see you here.
Is this your campsite?

01:48.191 --> 01:50.398
I took your advice.
Dropped the match.

01:50.611 --> 01:52.067
No more house, no more Big Jim.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.024
Oh.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.359
Ijust get so sweaty when I run.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.783
Do you have a clean shirt
I could borrow?

02:00.412 --> 02:01.822
Yeah.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.950
How does that make you feel?

02:08.170 --> 02:11.458
Feel like my dad's
gonna come after me.

02:13.133 --> 02:17.797
Well, letting go of the past
and moving on is a process.

02:19.056 --> 02:21.923
You've taken an important first step.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.511
Hey, what are you doing today?

02:24.728 --> 02:27.390
- I was gonna head into town.
- Perfect.

02:27.606 --> 02:29.142
I could use your help with a project.

02:31.860 --> 02:32.895
I'll see you soon.

02:35.781 --> 02:38.488
Normally, I'd applaud you, kid,

02:39.576 --> 02:41.407
but that woman...

[DOOR OPENS]

03:06.520 --> 03:09.637
Are you okay?
You said you'd be back in an hour.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.184
I didn't sleep all night, worrying.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.141
Yeah, I, uh...

03:14.820 --> 03:16.185
I was just out wandering.

03:16.405 --> 03:19.272
After I buried Melanie and Dad,
I needed some more time.

03:19.491 --> 03:21.072
Sorry.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.820
I understand.

03:23.245 --> 03:26.328
- What's this?
- It's an ID badge.

03:26.540 --> 03:29.657
I found it in the biggest cocoon,
where Melanie put the egg.

03:29.876 --> 03:32.128
I'm guessing whoever was inside
must be important.

03:36.675 --> 03:37.881
Yeah, makes sense.

03:39.261 --> 03:42.173
I think we should talk to Christine.
She knows more than she's telling us.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.050
Well, Christine saved your life.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.097
She killed Melanie to do it.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.391
And I'm grateful.

03:48.603 --> 03:51.345
But how did she show up
at the perfect time?

03:51.565 --> 03:52.896
She said she was out hunting.

03:54.651 --> 03:56.892
- Where are you going?
- Into town.

03:57.112 --> 03:58.648
Why?

03:59.364 --> 04:01.025
Because I think we should.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.822
Barbie, wait.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.957
What the hell?
Where's the camera?

04:14.921 --> 04:16.377
Where's the camera?

04:20.844 --> 04:23.210
CHRISTINE: It's amazing how quickly
they've begun to gather.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.844
Last night they heard my call.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.513
Today more have set up camp.

One by one,
they're completing theirjourneys.

04:30.896 --> 04:32.887
James is farthest along.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.269
He's let go of the fear
that held him back.

04:36.485 --> 04:40.023
Today I'll assess his progress and see
if he's ready to take the next step.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.364
Sam is also doing very well,

04:44.576 --> 04:45.907
putting his shame behind him.

04:46.119 --> 04:50.453
And Norrie has let go
of most of her anger.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.413
But I'm concerned about Joe.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.120
He didn't show up last night.

04:54.336 --> 04:57.169
Perhaps his grief has resurfaced.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.790
His resistance could be contagious
if it's not snuffed out.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.590
I'll pay him a visit.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.343
Well, I'm surprised to see
Barbie with Julia.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.466
He and Eva seemed
so bonded last night.

05:07.682 --> 05:10.469
But the moment he's ready
to move on,

05:11.228 --> 05:13.719
there won't be any reason
for her to exist.

- You said if I did, you would.

05:23.907 --> 05:24.942
Yeah, and you fell for it.

God, I can't believe we
stayed up all night.

05:33.792 --> 05:34.952
I'm not even tired.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.284
Staring at the moon
must be the cure for exhaustion,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.335
because I don't feel
like I'll need sleep again.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.038
Yeah, but what were we doing?

05:41.258 --> 05:42.668

05:43.885 --> 05:46.422
Who cares? It felt good.

Look, I was looking for you all night.

Let's just end this.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.717
The living situation outside
worries me.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.840
There's too many people
and not enough tents.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.047
The houses were destroyed
when the dome contracted,

06:32.267 --> 06:33.757
so there's nowhere else
for them to go.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.092
I'd like to change all that.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.145
So take your dad's office,
for instance.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.849
I'd like to blow out the walls
and fashion one large communal area.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.104
How would you do that?

06:47.032 --> 06:49.899
Remove the trim,
cut through the drywall.

Maybe someone's suspicious of you.

is a sign.

Oh, no, it's not a sign. It's a screw-up.

CHRISTINE: Barbie and Eva
are looking for food.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.177
But Junior could use you
on his dorm-building team.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.888
I'll show you.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.560
Do you mind waiting here for me?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.935
- Of course not.
CHRISTINE: Thanks. Come on.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.709
What are you doing with that?

13:22.135 --> 13:24.251
It looks like my voice recorder.

13:24.721 --> 13:25.801
I was a reporter,

13:26.014 --> 13:27.550
carried it everywhere.

13:27.765 --> 13:31.678
After the dome came down I lost it
in the chaos, so when I saw this...

13:31.894 --> 13:33.885
- In my drawer?
- You've only been here a day.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.562
I didn't think you had time
to furnish an office.

13:36.774 --> 13:37.980
You were snooping.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.102
I don't blame you.
I would have done the same thing.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.855
I'm happy to answer
any questions you have.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.822
What's on the recorder?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.696
Notes about my clients.

13:49.954 --> 13:52.286
What happened in those cocoons
left people reeling.

13:52.498 --> 13:54.363
I'm just trying to help.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.825

13:57.045 --> 13:58.785
It's the truth.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.503
Could I have that?

14:01.716 --> 14:03.798
I don't wanna betray
their confidences.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.092
I found something in the caves.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.640
Maybe you can help me figure out
who it belongs to,

14:12.852 --> 14:15.514
since you seem to know
everybody so well.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.061
Better than me, even.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.853

14:23.488 --> 14:25.479
Found it at the tunnel's exit.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.279
Finally, a question I can answer.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.366
It's my ID badge
from the University of Zenith.

Jack of all trades, huh?

Yeah, I like to keep busy.

14:41.547 --> 14:45.131
What happened between Barbie
and Eva must be very difficult for you.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.172
Well, that wasn't real. This is.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.004
I'm still impressed that you're okay
with them going off together,

Tell me about the egg.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.717
Egg?

15:29.929 --> 15:33.012
Oh, you-- Oh, you mean
the egg that I gave you

15:33.224 --> 15:35.306
after you promised
my family would get out.

15:35.518 --> 15:38.510
Somehow it got back in here,
along with your company.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.855
How did you get in?

15:40.022 --> 15:42.513

- Oh, I bet you'd like to know.

isn't there?

but you never followed through.

is scary as hell.

16:13.347 --> 16:15.804
And it's already been unleashed.

in the middle of a sandstorm, right?

we were gonna make it to the morning.

They're filled with cattle feed.

it was to let Joe see us like that.

He had a right to be pissed.
I would've been.

It's just...

18:43.581 --> 18:45.287
It feels like a year has passed to me.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.876
But for Joe, it seems like
it was just the one day.

18:49.170 --> 18:51.957
That makes no sense.
He was in the alternate reality too.

I didn't think that was possible.

26:49.149 --> 26:50.889
The feed had to be pulverized
and fermented,

26:51.110 --> 26:53.522
and it tastes disgusting,
but it's digestible.

26:58.408 --> 27:00.444
That's a good sign.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.870
All right, there's a window
up top here.

27:21.557 --> 27:23.468
- Anything?
- There's feed.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.265
How much?

27:26.061 --> 27:29.599
It looks like enough to hold us over
till the crops start producing.

A bunch got pulled off
of people's homes

28:01.346 --> 28:02.847
when the dome was magnetized.

We might be able to use them
to get the power running again.

28:13.734 --> 28:17.522
Actually, it was a conversation with her
that made me think of it.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.361
Guess she found you before I did.

28:20.574 --> 28:22.110
It was a good talk.

28:22.326 --> 28:25.443
She thinks my issues with Sam
are holding me back.

Your issues with Sam?

28:30.083 --> 28:33.041
That man murdered your sister
two weeks ago.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.663
Why does she care?

28:34.880 --> 28:36.245
And why do you listen to her?

28:36.965 --> 28:39.957
What she says just makes sense.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.919
We all have to work together now
and get along.

I've never heard you talk like that.

Oh, my God.

29:05.869 --> 29:07.484
Christine works for Aktaion.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.081
No. No way. Christine's a therapist.

That's what she said,
but I found her badge.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.292
She said it was her university ID.

That looks exactly
like the Aktaion logo to me.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.965

You're right.

So Christine's been lying to us?

29:25.222 --> 29:27.884
About that
and who knows what else.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.266
It'll have to be ground down, boiled.
We have to find a fermenting agent.

But it's doable.

29:32.688 --> 29:35.395
