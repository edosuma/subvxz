00:25.560 --> 00:26.696
Listen!

00:26.720 --> 00:27.720
Stop!

00:28.280 --> 00:29.496
You silly fucking twit!

00:29.520 --> 00:30.520
Please!

00:30.600 --> 00:34.434
You are one stupid
fucking bitch, you know that?

00:35.160 --> 00:36.639
Shut the fuck up!

00:36.760 --> 00:38.398
No.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.153
There you are.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.114
No!

00:48.760 --> 00:49.760
No.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.756
You're a little shit.
No!

00:52.160 --> 00:53.160
No!

01:46.240 --> 01:47.798
Anastasia Steele?

01:51.760 --> 01:52.988
Thanks.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.832
Yeah. Got it.
Thank you.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.509
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.750
Ana, please, it's Jack.

02:57.280 --> 02:59.236
Tea, right? Weak, black.

02:59.360 --> 03:02.238
I'm pretty sure
I'm supposed to get this for you,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.356
but thank you, Jack.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.193
Barbados is amazing.

03:21.360 --> 03:25.512
It's all coral
and turtles and booze...

03:25.640 --> 03:28.757
Oh! You should be here.
Why aren't you here?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.616
Yeah, and tell that
douchebag brother of mine

03:30.640 --> 03:32.640
to take a day off for once,
would ya?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.396
All right. Bye, Ana.
Bye!

04:12.400 --> 04:14.152
So, how's the new job?

04:15.400 --> 04:18.790
It's good. My boss has me
weighing in on submissions.

04:19.720 --> 04:21.676
That's exciting. Great.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.032
Have you heard from Christian?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.593
Yeah.

04:27.560 --> 04:29.278
He sent me flowers.

04:30.480 --> 04:32.152
To wish me luck.

04:32.240 --> 04:33.673
Sweetheart,

04:33.760 --> 04:36.593
are you ever gonna tell me
what happened between you?

04:39.640 --> 04:41.870
Fundamental
differences, I guess.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.911
It wasn't gonna last.

04:52.080 --> 04:53.354
Are those for me?

04:54.160 --> 04:55.593
Nah. They can wait.

04:55.760 --> 04:56.829
Okay.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.273
Look nice.
Going out tonight?

04:58.720 --> 05:03.350
Oh, um, a friend of mine has a
photography exhibition opening tonight.

05:03.440 --> 05:04.919
So, gonna go.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.320
Good.

05:07.080 --> 05:08.991
How did you make out
with those manuscripts?

05:09.360 --> 05:12.352
Oh, really great, actually.
This one, um...

05:12.680 --> 05:14.272
Boyce Fox.

05:14.440 --> 05:17.477
I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp.

05:17.640 --> 05:21.110
And relevant. And I think
he's really got something.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.280
You think?
Yeah.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.115
All right. I'll check it out.
Great.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.952
Have fun tonight, Ana.
Thank you.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.269
Thanks for today.

05:31.280 --> 05:32.280
Good night, Hannah.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.235
Bye!

05:47.800 --> 05:49.976
Glass of chardonnay?

05:51.480 --> 05:52.549
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

06:08.520 --> 06:09.873
Oh, my God.

06:11.200 --> 06:12.997
Jesus Christ.

06:21.160 --> 06:22.160
Ana!

06:23.360 --> 06:24.679
You made it.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.160
José...

06:26.680 --> 06:30.229
This is, like, so much
of my face in here.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.790
Well, if I had asked, you would
have been like, "I'm too shy."

06:33.960 --> 06:34.960
Yeah.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.792
But you...

06:38.200 --> 06:39.315
It's my best stuff.

06:39.480 --> 06:40.833
That's so...

06:41.680 --> 06:43.033
Do you like them?

06:43.560 --> 06:47.838
They are super large.

06:49.520 --> 06:50.520
Hold on.

06:50.560 --> 06:53.870
All the portraits
have sold to one man.

06:55.560 --> 06:57.073
You're kidding!
No.

06:59.200 --> 07:02.909
Well, somebody likes them.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.516
They just bought all six.

07:06.560 --> 07:07.595
All six?

07:07.720 --> 07:09.551
Dinner's on me tonight, okay?
Mmm.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.520
I'll be right back.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.589
Anastasia.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.438
It was you, wasn't it?
You just went and bought all of these?

07:53.920 --> 07:56.434
I don't like strangers
gawking at you.

07:57.800 --> 07:59.472
Why are you here?

08:01.400 --> 08:03.118
For you.

08:04.120 --> 08:05.394
Hey.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.790
Can we talk somewhere private?

08:09.960 --> 08:10.960
No.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.432
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...

08:14.600 --> 08:17.114
I've never wanted
to try again.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.719
Christian, I don't...

08:20.800 --> 08:22.631
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.796
Okay? Just talk, please.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.633
Have dinner with me.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.195
Okay, fine. I will have
dinner with you.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.957
Because I'm hungry.

08:40.159 --> 08:43.311
But we are only talking
and that is it.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.188
Hold on.

08:57.080 --> 08:58.752
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.

08:58.840 --> 09:01.638
Already? Your photos
are so stunning, José.

09:01.720 --> 09:04.234
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of you.

09:36.160 --> 09:39.232
Christian, I can't.
I can't do this.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.638
Christ, Ana.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.749
Okay.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.478
I have a proposition.

09:50.640 --> 09:52.995
Just come to dinner.
We can talk.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.376
Would you like
some more time?

09:58.400 --> 10:02.234
No. Two steaks, medium.
Fries. Green vegetables.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.037
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.589
Fine.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.955
And two glasses of
the Barossa Valley Shiraz.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.031
We only sell that
by the bottle, sir.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
A bottle then.

10:14.440 --> 10:15.589
Yes, sir.

10:16.960 --> 10:17.960
Thanks.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.080
So?

10:20.720 --> 10:22.073
Let's talk.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.039
I want you back.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.955
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.397
But I don't see how.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.792
The things you want, you
said that's the way you are.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.073
But what happened last time,
that's not gonna happen again.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.311
How can you say that?

10:49.160 --> 10:54.632
I know that I asked you
to show me how far it can go,

10:57.600 --> 11:00.797
but you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.

11:04.640 --> 11:05.834
That's still in you.

11:06.680 --> 11:08.511
I'm working on it.

11:08.680 --> 11:10.432
Working on what?

11:13.840 --> 11:16.149
I can't do this
if you won't talk to me.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.513
What do you wanna know?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.318
Everything.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.509
Fine.

11:38.800 --> 11:39.869
Yeah. We'll manage.

11:50.800 --> 11:53.030
My birth mother died
when I was four.

11:53.200 --> 11:55.509
She was an addict. Crack.

11:56.720 --> 11:58.119
You can fill in the blanks.

11:59.760 --> 12:00.840
Why didn't you
tell me that?

12:00.880 --> 12:01.880
I did.

12:02.320 --> 12:05.551
But you were asleep
at the time.

12:06.960 --> 12:09.554
Okay. Well, um...

12:10.360 --> 12:11.509
Generally,

12:12.240 --> 12:14.800
a key part
of good communication

12:14.920 --> 12:18.390
is that both parties
be conscious.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.910
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

12:25.920 --> 12:27.399
It's in the past.

12:28.560 --> 12:32.394
Now, I brought you here
to negotiate.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.116
You're open to new terms?

12:37.720 --> 12:39.039
No rules.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.589
No punishments.

12:46.760 --> 12:49.069
No rules, no punishments

12:49.600 --> 12:51.113
and no more secrets.

12:52.760 --> 12:54.398
I can do that.

12:54.560 --> 12:55.788
You want a...

12:56.000 --> 12:57.592
What do you call it?

12:58.080 --> 12:59.957
A vanilla relationship?

13:00.120 --> 13:03.157
I mean, we only do what
you're comfortable with.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.114
But you need all those things.

13:08.440 --> 13:10.396
I need you more.

13:18.640 --> 13:19.640
Miss Steele.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.994
Thanks, Taylor.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.953
No strings attached.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.112
This is spiky.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.188
I like it.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.159
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:04.520 --> 14:05.520
Okay.

14:06.480 --> 14:07.674
Good night.

15:23.680 --> 15:27.150
Ana, I've been hearing a lot
of good things about you.

15:27.440 --> 15:28.839
- Oh...
- Told you, Liz.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.559
This one actually reads.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
Hey, Jack.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.256
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

15:35.640 --> 15:38.029
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.

15:38.520 --> 15:42.513
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lori's would do the trick.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.675
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.313
Who's Lori?

15:47.480 --> 15:49.391
Oh, it's a bar
around the corner.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.910
Oh. Fridays
are a bit of a ritual.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.232
You should come.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.752
Absolutely. Go network.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.708
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.828
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

16:05.720 --> 16:06.914
Hello?

16:07.080 --> 16:08.080
Yeah.

16:10.840 --> 16:12.193
Have fun.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.713
Anastasia.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.916
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

16:26.920 --> 16:28.433
It's okay.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.229
I'm nobody.

16:30.880 --> 16:33.235
Hey. Lori's is this way.

16:33.400 --> 16:35.516
Come on, I'm buying.

16:40.120 --> 16:41.792
All right. Here we go.

16:42.480 --> 16:43.595
Mmm. Thanks.

16:43.760 --> 16:45.079
Where is everyone?

16:45.240 --> 16:46.912
You know, it's still early.

16:47.760 --> 16:51.036
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.

16:51.200 --> 16:52.952
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.391
Yeah, well, I think
the parallels

16:55.480 --> 16:57.596
with Dante's Inferno
are amazing, but...

16:57.760 --> 16:59.830
No. You convinced me.

16:59.920 --> 17:00.920
I'm reading.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.636
Oh. That's great.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.435
Hey.
Hi!

17:06.560 --> 17:07.675
Um, uh...

17:07.760 --> 17:09.557
Christian,
this is Jack Hyde.

17:10.319 --> 17:11.548
I'm the boyfriend.

17:13.079 --> 17:14.593
I'm the boss.

17:14.800 --> 17:16.074
What will you have, Chris?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.549
Thanks, Jack.

17:18.760 --> 17:20.318
Another time.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.319
Thanks.

17:28.600 --> 17:29.999
Another time.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.360
I can't believe you
just talked to him like that.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.358
He wants what's mine.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.112
What's yours?

17:37.320 --> 17:39.197
That's a little presumptuous.

17:39.840 --> 17:42.798
He's my boss, Christian.
You gotta calm down.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.195
Calm isn't really
my forte.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.634
I know something that could help.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.470
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.

17:58.880 --> 18:01.155
When's the last time
you went shopping?

18:01.800 --> 18:04.030
Houston. A week ago.

18:04.200 --> 18:05.599
What'd you buy?

18:05.760 --> 18:07.159
An airline.

18:10.960 --> 18:11.995
Here.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.391
Your new favorite flavor.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.953
Excuse me.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.519
Do you need a hand
with that?

18:43.320 --> 18:44.753
I'll manage.

18:45.560 --> 18:46.675
Okay.

18:50.680 --> 18:51.874
I know what you're doing.

18:52.040 --> 18:54.508
What? I'm being
a culinary mastermind.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.716
You only have to ask.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.950
I think we should
take it slow.

19:03.280 --> 19:04.395
Okay.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.516
Okay.
Okay.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.871
Tell me about SIP.

19:13.040 --> 19:14.439
How's it going?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.599
It's good.

19:17.800 --> 19:21.679
Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.

19:21.760 --> 19:23.239
What's morale like?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.355
Morale?

19:24.440 --> 19:26.040
You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle

19:26.080 --> 19:28.120
and sing the company song
in the morning?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.953
Is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?

19:32.200 --> 19:33.200
Oh, my God.

19:33.280 --> 19:34.508
What?

19:35.240 --> 19:36.468
You're buying SIP?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.274
No! You can't do that.
That's my job.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.237
You can't start
interfering in my career.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.277
It's not about that.

19:44.440 --> 19:48.035
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They're the best fit.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.271
But you're gonna
be my boss.

19:51.760 --> 19:54.069
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.

19:54.240 --> 19:57.073
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my boss's boss's boss.

19:57.240 --> 19:58.673
Right now,
you're arguing with him.

19:58.880 --> 20:00.472
Yeah, because
he's being an ass.

20:00.640 --> 20:02.915
An ass. Really?

20:03.080 --> 20:04.354
Ass.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Ooh...

20:15.000 --> 20:17.195
You know
that's off limits.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.151
I'm gonna need a road map.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.595
I thought you wanted to
take it slow.

20:50.200 --> 20:52.839
What do you want, Anastasia?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.833
If we're to communicate,
you have to tell me.

21:01.360 --> 21:03.157
I want you.

21:19.560 --> 21:21.357
I'm too dressed.

21:33.040 --> 21:34.040
Keep going.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.549
Kiss me.

22:36.360 --> 22:38.271
What do you want, Anastasia?

22:41.960 --> 22:44.030
I want all of you.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.237
Why do you think
you waited?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.388
For sex.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.000
Mmm.

23:32.680 --> 23:33.680
Mmm.

23:36.200 --> 23:40.318
I was reading
Austen and Brontë

23:40.520 --> 23:43.239
and nobody ever
measured up to that.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.675
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.671
And then I met you.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.192
Would Miss Austen

24:00.040 --> 24:01.996
approve of this?

24:04.040 --> 24:05.268
I was being romantic,

24:05.360 --> 24:08.352
and then you just go and distract
me with your kinky fuckery.

24:09.200 --> 24:11.031
"Kinky fuckery"?
Mmm-hmm.

24:11.520 --> 24:14.512
I don't know what that is,
but I like the sound of it.

24:52.520 --> 24:55.239
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't wanna wake you.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.231
There's not much
for breakfast,

24:59.400 --> 25:01.391
unless you want
cold stir-fry.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.393
No.
Mmm.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.958
Here. The check you gave me for
Wanda, you should have it back.

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
Keep it.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.869
Keep it? It's $24,000.

25:14.320 --> 25:15.548
Yeah, I know.

25:16.400 --> 25:19.039
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.

25:42.840 --> 25:44.751
Andrea? Good morning.

25:45.760 --> 25:49.673
Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Miss Anastasia Steele?

25:49.840 --> 25:50.909
No! What are you doing?

25:52.000 --> 25:53.877
That's fine.
Thank you.

25:56.280 --> 25:58.635
Why do you have
my bank account details?

25:59.440 --> 26:00.920
What's good for breakfast
around here?

26:01.000 --> 26:03.912
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

26:08.760 --> 26:10.113
Thank you.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.316
Gotta be quicker
than that, Grey.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.874
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.038
I promised I'd make
an appearance.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.152
Want you
to come with me.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.111
I've never been to a ball.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.871
I don't have
a dress for that.

26:32.280 --> 26:34.350
Also, what am I gonna
do with my hair?

26:34.520 --> 26:35.839
I know a salon.

26:36.360 --> 26:38.430
And you don't need to
worry about a dress.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.079
It's all gonna be
taken care of.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.476
What is it?
Um...

26:45.800 --> 26:47.119
There was just a girl
over there.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.156
And she was outside
my office yesterday.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.952
And she knew my name.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.430
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.871
We should go.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.473
Just now.

27:05.960 --> 27:07.075
Yeah.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.034
Keep me informed.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.798
You know that girl, Christian?

27:14.880 --> 27:16.996
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?

27:17.800 --> 27:20.189
I don't want you to worry about it.
Trust me.

27:28.840 --> 27:29.840
Um...

27:32.480 --> 27:34.391
Hey, how are you doing?

27:34.560 --> 27:37.711
Good, okay. So, uh,
my girlfriend's here...

27:45.880 --> 27:46.880
Oh.

28:19.960 --> 28:20.960
Ana.

28:23.960 --> 28:25.791
Was that Mrs. Robinson?

28:26.640 --> 28:27.709
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.600
I don't care what her
name is, Christian.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.278
Why would you
take me there?

28:31.880 --> 28:34.917
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

28:35.000 --> 28:38.197
Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.515
And business partners.

28:39.880 --> 28:41.836
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?

28:43.480 --> 28:45.357
Would you take
your Subs there?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.551
Oh, my God! For what?
Her approval?

28:50.640 --> 28:51.709
What?
What is this?

28:51.800 --> 28:53.870
No. It's not like that.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.719
That girl that I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

28:57.640 --> 28:59.073
Let's discuss this
back at my place.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.760
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.296
Christian, I don't care
about my hair!

29:02.320 --> 29:03.878
Explain to me what's going on.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.315
I'll explain when
we're there. Come on.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.829
Okay, you can either walk or I
can carry you. Your choice.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.195
You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.515
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll walk.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.150
Her name's
Leila Williams.

29:24.040 --> 29:25.880
She was my Sub for a while
about two years ago.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.512
What happened to her?

29:29.440 --> 29:31.715
She wanted more.
I didn't.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.759
So I ended it.

29:35.360 --> 29:37.590
She left. Got married.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.752
I thought she moved on, but then
her husband died in a car crash.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.598
She had a breakdown.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.519
What does she want now?

29:49.280 --> 29:51.635
When you and I were in Georgia
together, she turned up here

29:51.720 --> 29:54.757
and tried to slit her wrists in front
of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.

29:55.600 --> 29:56.715
Oh, my God.

29:56.880 --> 29:59.997
Gail took her to the hospital,
but by the time I got there,

30:00.080 --> 30:01.399
she'd taken off.

30:01.560 --> 30:04.199
My people have been
trying to find her.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.079
Your people?

30:07.880 --> 30:10.235
Is that who
put this together?

30:14.400 --> 30:15.879
Is there one on me?

30:21.280 --> 30:22.474
Let me see it.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.750
"Subject works part time at
Clayton's Hardware, Richmond Road."

30:54.600 --> 30:57.910
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.

30:59.200 --> 31:01.475
You should probably
get your money back.

31:02.600 --> 31:05.273
I had them drawn up on any
prospective Submissive.

31:05.480 --> 31:08.199
Nice. Jesus.

31:08.360 --> 31:10.430
I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

31:10.600 --> 31:11.880
I didn't know
you'd be different.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.269
Different? Really?

31:16.160 --> 31:18.720
Is that why you brought me
to Mrs. Robinson's,

31:18.880 --> 31:22.111
where you brought all the other women?
Because I'm so different?

31:23.560 --> 31:25.312
That was wrong. I admit.

31:25.480 --> 31:28.472
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.

31:30.800 --> 31:34.634
You put money into my account that...
I don't want it.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.072
You bought the company
I work for.

31:38.720 --> 31:42.030
This isn't a relationship,
Christian. It's ownership.

31:44.480 --> 31:46.198
I'm trying to understand you.

31:47.240 --> 31:51.836
I am just wanting to
get close to you.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.120
But it's really difficult to
do that when you keep doing

31:56.200 --> 31:57.838
bizarre things like this.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.720
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.232
Come to my bedroom.

32:13.720 --> 32:16.598
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?

32:16.680 --> 32:18.796
Ana, please.

32:23.600 --> 32:25.477
You wanted a road map?

32:40.400 --> 32:41.674
Start here.

33:16.760 --> 33:18.512
Those are my boundaries.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.319
I can live with that.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.792
Then I'm all yours.

33:36.240 --> 33:38.549
Mr. Grey,
your appointment's arrived.

33:39.360 --> 33:41.430
Okay. Send him
into Ana's room.

33:43.120 --> 33:44.120
He's here.

33:44.760 --> 33:46.193
Who's here?

33:50.840 --> 33:51.840
Wow.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.078
Hair up, I think. Yes?

33:54.240 --> 33:57.118
Your neck is beautiful.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.349
Christian?

34:04.760 --> 34:05.760
Ciao, bella.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.514
You're just gonna
stand there gawking?

34:56.080 --> 34:57.229
Yeah.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.992
Yeah, I think I might.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.072
So I was thinking

35:21.000 --> 35:23.798
tonight might be
more stimulating

35:23.960 --> 35:25.598
if you wear these.

35:29.240 --> 35:31.754
How am I supposed
to wear those?

35:33.680 --> 35:34.795
Well,

35:35.520 --> 35:37.590
you have to get them
wet first.

35:38.880 --> 35:40.029
Curious?

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
Mmm-hmm.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.869
Okay.

35:47.040 --> 35:48.268
Open your mouth.

35:57.560 --> 35:58.560
Good.

36:01.720 --> 36:04.029
Now turn. Bend over.

36:05.440 --> 36:07.670
No, you're not putting
those in my butt.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.474
They don't
go in your butt.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.234
Stay still.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.195
Stand up straight
and turn around.

36:51.520 --> 36:52.953
How's it feel?

36:53.200 --> 36:54.200
Mmm...

36:55.480 --> 36:56.629
Weird.

36:58.360 --> 36:59.759
But good.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.269
What do they do?

37:05.760 --> 37:07.512
You'll find out.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.795
Wear the silver satin.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.956
It'll go well with these.

37:17.760 --> 37:21.230
Don't worry. They're for your ears.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.440
Did I mention it was
a masked ball?

37:44.680 --> 37:45.680
No.

37:50.160 --> 37:52.879
Your new bodyguards
need to wear these, too?

37:54.000 --> 37:55.149
I'm just being safe.

37:55.320 --> 37:57.436
You won't even notice
they're here.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.998
Come on.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.957
The way you wear your hat

38:21.560 --> 38:24.028
The way you sip your tea

38:25.920 --> 38:29.629
The memory of all that

38:30.440 --> 38:34.479
No, no, they can't take that
away from me

38:34.920 --> 38:38.071
The way your smile just beams

38:39.160 --> 38:42.118
The way you sing off-key

38:43.360 --> 38:45.191
Everybody's looking at us.

38:45.360 --> 38:47.237
Not us. You.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.836
Christian! I'm so glad
you made it. Mother.

38:50.920 --> 38:52.876
"Mother" is so formal.
Honestly.

38:53.040 --> 38:54.109
Ana.
Hi.

38:54.640 --> 38:55.675
How you doing?

38:55.760 --> 38:58.718
These things are beautiful,
and they are mysterious,

38:58.840 --> 39:00.876
but they're a pain
in the ass.

39:01.200 --> 39:03.873
You look spectacular.

39:04.320 --> 39:07.153
Thank you. So do you.
This dress is so beautiful.

39:07.360 --> 39:08.429
Thank you, Ana.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.194
I'm so glad you're back
with Christian.

39:11.360 --> 39:12.475
He was lost without you.

39:12.640 --> 39:14.119
Can I have my date
back, please? Oh.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.840
By all means. Spoilsport.

39:17.320 --> 39:18.753
See you later.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.959
No, no, they can't take that
away from me

39:30.600 --> 39:33.433
Ana! My God!

39:33.640 --> 39:36.950
That dress, it should be illegal.
Monique Lhuillier.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.519
Yeah. Mia.

39:38.880 --> 39:41.189
Mia, you know
I barely recognized you.

39:41.360 --> 39:43.749
Yeah! The new me.
Okay, what do you think?

39:44.680 --> 39:46.955
Well, it's very, uh, blonde.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.713
How do you put up with him?

39:48.880 --> 39:51.758
Do you know he was an even
bigger pain as a teenager?

39:51.920 --> 39:54.957
He got expelled from four
different schools for brawling.

39:55.160 --> 39:57.230
That's enough. Yeah,
totally out of control.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.152
- Mia, enough.
- Mia?

39:59.240 --> 40:00.832
I'll be right back.

40:01.240 --> 40:02.514
Hi! How are you?

40:02.680 --> 40:03.795
Ana?
Hmm?

40:04.000 --> 40:06.833
You will be sitting here, darling.
Right next to Cary.

40:07.000 --> 40:08.000
Christian, you over here.

40:08.160 --> 40:10.993
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen,
to our annual ball.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.472
As you know,
proceeds from this evening

40:13.560 --> 40:17.075
will go to the charity that Grace
and I founded so many years ago...

40:17.240 --> 40:19.151
Coping Together.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.136
Working to make life better
for the children...

40:21.160 --> 40:23.720
...of parents addicted to drugs.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.200
Everything okay?

40:25.400 --> 40:27.072
And now, thankfully,

40:27.160 --> 40:28.878
I will be handing off
my speaking duties

40:29.040 --> 40:32.237
to our master of ceremonies,
Mr. Nomad Paul.

40:33.440 --> 40:36.159
Thank you, Mr. Grey,
and thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

40:36.240 --> 40:37.355
Hungry?

40:37.520 --> 40:39.240
Let's start the bidding
with lot number one.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.360
Ravenous.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.351
- Do I hear $10,000?
- Ten!

40:42.840 --> 40:45.115
Now you know what those
silver balls do.

40:45.280 --> 40:46.280
$15,000.

40:46.600 --> 40:48.113
$15,000.

40:48.560 --> 40:51.358
Going once, going twice...

40:51.520 --> 40:52.520
Sold!

40:54.800 --> 40:58.110
That's a great start, ladies and gentlemen.
Now, lot number two,

40:58.440 --> 41:02.353
a week's vacation at a luxury
chalet in Aspen, Colorado,

41:02.560 --> 41:04.835
donated by
Mr. Christian Grey.

41:04.920 --> 41:05.920
Mmm.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.471
Let's start the bidding off
at $ 10,000.

41:08.960 --> 41:09.960
$ 10,000!

41:10.040 --> 41:11.792
Thank you, ma 'am. $ 10,000.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.872
I didn't know
you had a place in Aspen.

41:14.560 --> 41:16.073
I have a lot of places.

41:16.280 --> 41:18.416
Boy, we have some ski lovers
in the room tonight.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.475
$17,000!

41:19.640 --> 41:22.074
$17, 000. Thank you, sir. 18?

41:22.160 --> 41:24.230
$18,000.
$18,000.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.072
Thank you. Do I hear 19? 19?

41:26.160 --> 41:27.195
19.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.236
$19, 000. Thank you, sir.

41:29.400 --> 41:32.472
A week of luxury in
America's finest ski resort.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.119
$24,000.

41:34.280 --> 41:37.750
New blood! $24,000 I am bid.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.678
Do I hear $25,000?

41:39.760 --> 41:40.909
That money was for you.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.230
And now it'll go to
someone who needs it.

41:43.920 --> 41:48.072
I don't know whether to worship
at your feet or spank you.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.834
$24, 000.
Going once...

41:51.760 --> 41:53.478
I think...
Going twice...

41:53.640 --> 41:54.789
...I'll take option two.

41:55.640 --> 41:58.518
Sold! To the young lady
in silver.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.752
Your generosity really makes a difference,
ladies and gentlemen.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.995
Let's go.

42:34.880 --> 42:35.949
You want this?

42:36.240 --> 42:38.037
I want you to spank me.

42:52.640 --> 42:53.834
Hands.

43:16.400 --> 43:19.358
If it gets too much, you have
to tell me to stop, understood?

43:20.000 --> 43:21.000
Yes.

43:51.880 --> 43:52.915
Hold still.

44:26.960 --> 44:28.109
I want you to come, Ana.

44:28.280 --> 44:29.633
Come for me.

44:48.160 --> 44:50.276
Is this your room?

44:50.760 --> 44:52.113
Once upon a time.

45:11.800 --> 45:12.994
Who's this?

45:17.040 --> 45:18.393
Is that your mother?

45:25.640 --> 45:28.154
You know you can just say you
don't wanna talk about it.

45:28.480 --> 45:31.233
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.230
Let's go.
They'll be missing us.

45:36.640 --> 45:39.552
Uh, I just need a minute.

45:39.640 --> 45:41.517
I'll meet you downstairs.

45:41.880 --> 45:42.880
Okay.

45:44.320 --> 45:45.912
Don't forget your mask.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.830
...under my skin

46:19.200 --> 46:22.795
I'd sacrifice anything
come what might

46:22.880 --> 46:24.757
For the sake of
having you near

46:24.920 --> 46:25.920
What?

46:26.800 --> 46:27.869
Nothing.

46:29.040 --> 46:33.636
...comes in the night And
repeats and repeats in my ear

46:33.800 --> 46:39.079
Don't you know, little fool
You never can win

46:51.240 --> 46:52.878
Christian has a date.

46:53.840 --> 46:55.353
I'm impressed.

46:56.520 --> 46:58.033
I'm sorry?

46:58.960 --> 47:00.109
Elena.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.316
I wanted to meet you.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.677
I can't say the same.
Excuse me.

47:06.880 --> 47:09.348
Hey, I'm not the enemy.

47:11.520 --> 47:14.114
I know what you did
to Christian.

47:14.280 --> 47:17.829
All I did was lead him to the
truth of who he really is.

47:18.000 --> 47:21.629
Without me, he'd be
in jail or dead.

47:21.800 --> 47:23.153
And he would say the same.

47:23.240 --> 47:24.309
I'm not listening to this.

47:24.400 --> 47:28.075
Do you think you're the first
woman he'd hoped would save him?

47:28.720 --> 47:32.190
He needs a Submissive
in life.

47:32.360 --> 47:34.191
Not just in the bedroom.

47:35.400 --> 47:37.630
No, he's changing that.

47:38.200 --> 47:39.758
It's not what
he wants anymore.

47:39.960 --> 47:41.518
But it's what he needs.

47:41.680 --> 47:44.990
And you don't strike me as the type
of woman who wants to be owned.

47:45.840 --> 47:49.310
If you really wanna make him
happy, if you wanna be happy,

47:50.080 --> 47:51.513
you'll let him go.

47:52.280 --> 47:56.796
There's no way that someone like you
could ever understand what we have.

47:56.960 --> 47:58.632
I've been there.

47:58.800 --> 48:00.711
Nothing lasts.

48:01.280 --> 48:02.280
Nothing.

48:03.000 --> 48:05.719
Whatever happens
between me and Christian

48:05.800 --> 48:07.836
is none of your
goddamn business.

48:08.000 --> 48:10.070
So you stay the fuck
away from us.

48:16.840 --> 48:19.434
Hey, we should
think about going soon.

48:19.600 --> 48:21.158
I wanna go now.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.551
What did Elena
say to you?

48:37.920 --> 48:40.559
Nothing I didn't
already know.

48:44.480 --> 48:46.630
Will you just take me
to my house?

48:47.800 --> 48:49.438
Stay with me tonight.

49:01.040 --> 49:03.952
Hey, wake up.
We're home. Hmm.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.160
Sir?

49:13.960 --> 49:15.188
Stay here.

49:42.200 --> 49:43.235
We'll have
the car towed.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.719
What happened?

49:45.320 --> 49:47.709
That's my car!
What happened to my car?

49:47.800 --> 49:49.296
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.

49:49.320 --> 49:50.673
Yes, sir. Right away.
Copy that.

49:50.880 --> 49:52.359
Smith, you stick
with Mr. Grey.

49:54.320 --> 49:56.072
Where are we going?

49:56.720 --> 49:58.119
Christian?

49:59.200 --> 50:00.997
Do you think
it was Leila?

50:01.160 --> 50:03.674
You really think she would
do something like that?

50:07.200 --> 50:09.536
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.

50:09.560 --> 50:11.630
That place
is like a fortress.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.950
There's no way she could
have gotten in there.

50:14.120 --> 50:17.192
She shouldn't have been able to
get into the garage, either.

50:17.360 --> 50:19.191
I'm not taking
any chances.

50:27.200 --> 50:28.679
Good evening, Mr. Grey.

50:28.840 --> 50:29.989
Hey, Ed.

50:31.960 --> 50:34.030
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.

50:40.640 --> 50:43.359
If something were to happen
to you because of me...

50:44.040 --> 50:45.359
It won't.

50:46.120 --> 50:48.031
Nothing's gonna
happen to me.

50:55.960 --> 50:57.632
Can I wash this off?

51:01.160 --> 51:02.957
Don't stray
from the lines.

51:03.160 --> 51:04.275
Okay.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.518
Are these burns?

51:39.680 --> 51:41.671
Who did this to you?

51:43.640 --> 51:45.278
Go on, it's over.

51:52.040 --> 51:57.990
I know how difficult it is
for you to open up to me

52:00.200 --> 52:02.156
and tell me these things.

52:06.040 --> 52:08.270
But it means
the world to me.

52:09.800 --> 52:11.950
It means you love me.

52:13.680 --> 52:16.399
Yes, I do.

52:45.040 --> 52:48.077
So this is where your knot-tying
expertise comes from.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.593
Good morning.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.594
Sleep well?

52:51.760 --> 52:52.875
I did.

52:55.760 --> 52:57.557
This boat
is really beautiful.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.151
This is from my yard
in Seattle.

53:00.600 --> 53:01.874
You built it?

53:02.000 --> 53:04.639
I had some help.

53:04.720 --> 53:06.358
It's called The Grace.

53:08.080 --> 53:09.433
After your mom?

53:10.440 --> 53:12.237
You sound surprised.

53:12.400 --> 53:15.233
Well, you're always
so cool towards her.

53:16.240 --> 53:18.117
I owe everything to Grace.

53:18.280 --> 53:20.794
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.

53:23.600 --> 53:25.795
Do you remember
your birth mom?

53:25.960 --> 53:27.518
I try not to.

53:30.200 --> 53:32.191
What happened to her?

53:33.480 --> 53:34.549
She overdosed.

53:34.640 --> 53:37.234
They found her body
three days later.

53:39.720 --> 53:41.199
Where were you?

53:41.400 --> 53:42.594
I was with her.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.159
Oh, my God.

53:47.880 --> 53:49.632
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.

53:51.240 --> 53:52.639
Grace was there.

53:57.000 --> 53:58.956
Thank you
for telling me.

54:04.080 --> 54:05.832
Look at that house.

54:08.000 --> 54:11.231
That's beautiful.
The view's probably amazing.

54:11.320 --> 54:13.038
I wonder who lives there.

54:13.840 --> 54:15.796
It's an old sea widow.

54:15.960 --> 54:17.996
Lost her husband years ago.

54:18.160 --> 54:21.232
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.

54:22.680 --> 54:24.511
Did you just make that up?

54:24.680 --> 54:25.680
Yeah.

54:28.760 --> 54:30.352
You wanna take the helm?

54:30.440 --> 54:31.440
Me?

54:31.520 --> 54:33.351
Yeah, you. Come on.

54:33.520 --> 54:35.829
I can't do that.

54:57.960 --> 54:59.359
See where I'm looking?
Yeah.

54:59.560 --> 55:00.560
Right there. Just hold.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.114
Okay?
Okay.

55:10.320 --> 55:11.696
No, you're fine, Ana.
I'm still here.

55:11.720 --> 55:12.755
Don't let go.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.068
I have to let go.
Don't.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.389
Oh, my God. Okay.
Okay?

55:15.560 --> 55:17.312
You ready?
Okay.

55:32.200 --> 55:34.589
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm steering it.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.751
I'm doing it.
I'm the captain.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.909
Oh, my God!

55:51.760 --> 55:53.557
Hey.
Hey, Jack.

55:53.720 --> 55:55.995
Personal calls on your
own time, okay?

56:04.960 --> 56:05.995
Yeah?

56:06.080 --> 56:07.638
Um, did you get
my message?

56:08.120 --> 56:12.318
You had a phone call this morning
with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.

56:12.680 --> 56:13.715
Shit.

56:14.440 --> 56:16.351
I can just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.

56:16.560 --> 56:19.279
Did you book our rooms
for New York yet?

56:20.240 --> 56:21.240
Sorry?

56:21.360 --> 56:24.477
New York. Book expo.
This Friday. It's in the diary.

56:24.560 --> 56:27.154
No, yeah, I know. Yeah, I
booked your room. Of course.

56:27.720 --> 56:28.914
And you.

56:29.080 --> 56:31.435
It's expected that
my assistant also attends.

56:33.520 --> 56:35.192
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

56:35.360 --> 56:36.429
Don't apologize.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.591
Just get yourself a room.

56:40.080 --> 56:42.719
Unless you'd rather stay
back with your boyfriend.

56:43.200 --> 56:45.077
I mean, it's not like
you need to work.

56:48.440 --> 56:49.759
I'll sort it out.

56:50.040 --> 56:51.996
Eric, hey. It's Jack.
How was your weekend?

56:54.920 --> 56:56.148
No shit.

56:56.920 --> 56:59.559
Mine was great.
It was fantastic.

57:00.520 --> 57:02.636
Yeah, 'cause I read
your new pages.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.310
No, they're amazing.
Amazing.

57:06.280 --> 57:07.838
No, I couldn't
put it down.

57:08.000 --> 57:10.355
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants of course,

57:10.480 --> 57:12.336
but more than 70% of the funding...

57:12.360 --> 57:15.511
...will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.

57:15.600 --> 57:17.670
We'll be making cutting edge
renewable energy tech

57:17.760 --> 57:19.432
that will more than
repay our investment.

57:42.520 --> 57:44.272
...provides a solid consumer base...

57:44.360 --> 57:45.873
...for our products.

57:46.040 --> 57:48.349
We're aware that
you have other bidders

57:48.440 --> 57:52.035
and some of them may offer what
look like better terms, but...

58:06.080 --> 58:07.149
Hello?

58:11.120 --> 58:12.189
Christian?

58:14.520 --> 58:16.272
Oh, my God!

58:16.440 --> 58:18.680
Oh, excuse me, Miss Steele,
I didn't mean to startle you.

58:18.720 --> 58:20.358
No, no.

58:20.920 --> 58:22.273
You are very quiet.

58:22.760 --> 58:25.479
I'm Mrs. Jones. Mr. Grey's
housekeeper. May I?

58:25.880 --> 58:26.880
Oh, um...

58:27.920 --> 58:29.638
Sure. Thank you.

58:30.960 --> 58:31.995
Um, I'm Ana.

58:32.160 --> 58:36.119
But you knew that already
because you said my last name.

58:36.760 --> 58:39.194
Mr. Grey is in his study,
just finishing up a call.

58:39.640 --> 58:42.074
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me. Okay.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:07.274
See anything you like?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:10.197
Oh, fuck.

01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:14.433
The door was, um, unlocked.

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.276
I'll have to talk to
Mrs. Jones.

01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.710
Does she come in here a lot?

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.318
Does she dust in here?

01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:30.917
Those are nipple clamps.

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:37.598
Come here.
Give me your hand.

01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:51.994
It's even more intense
when you take them off.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.148
Ow.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.239
What's this?

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:11.080
Okay.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.074
That's enough show-and-tell.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.639
What's this?

01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:19.115
Let's learn to walk
before we run.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.755
I kinda like running.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.115
Ana?
Mmm-hmm?

01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:33.197
Last time we did this,
you saw another side of me.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.228
And you left.

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:39.191
Last time was different.

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:47.509
All right. But not here.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.554
Mrs. Jones.

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:54.352
Oh, my God.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:29.829
You're mine.

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:32.874
I'm yours.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.591
You okay?
Yeah.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:44.870
You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.473
We have talked about it.

01:04:46.640 --> 01:04:49.313
You forbidding it is
not us talking about it.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.959
If you wanna go to New York,
don't go with Hyde.

01:04:53.120 --> 01:04:54.838
Let me take you.
I have a place there.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.151
Of course you do.

01:04:57.240 --> 01:04:58.878
This isn't
some sort of vacation.

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.714
It's a work trip with my boss,
who I would like to impress.

01:05:03.840 --> 01:05:06.115
You know he's had three
assistants in the last 18 months,

01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:07.952
all of whom have quit
without notice?

01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:09.473
You don't think
I can handle him?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.392
That's not it.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.717
That's what it feels like.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:18.677
Ana, I know full well
that you can handle anything.

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:22.230
And, uh, if you
really wanna go,

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:23.913
then I can't stop you.

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:26.551
But I'd like to
take you there myself.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:32.680
Okay.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.553
Okay?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200
Yeah.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.397
I mean, of course I would
rather see New York with you.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:43.200
Good.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.394
I hate it when we fight.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:48.238
That wasn't a fight.

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.670
That was a conversation.

01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:55.429
It was, you know, when somebody talks,
and the other person listens,

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:57.192
and you resolve an issue.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.753
That's how it works.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.194
It's crazy, isn't it?

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.029
Night, Ana.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.474
Good night, Hannah.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.629
You leaving?

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:37.119
Um, I was actually just about to come
talk to you. Uh, about New York.

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.433
There a problem?

01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680
Um...

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:44.558
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity, Jack,

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.756
but with such short notice,
I made plans

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:47.909
that I can't change.
Huh.

01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.990
But I will have my phone
on me all weekend.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:53.719
So if you need anything,
I'm available.

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.272
Ana, have a seat.

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.437
I'm really... I'm sorry.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.748
I think you have
tremendous potential here.

01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.234
But I don't wanna
waste my time

01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.959
training someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:14.189
I do.

01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:16.599
This is my dream job.

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.429
Then shouldn't going to New York and
the book expo be part of that dream?

01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.635
It is.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.918
It is.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.195
It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:31.150
Because there are plenty of qualified
people who would kill for this job.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:35.677
I mean, look, I don't wanna brag,
but I'm a pretty great teacher.

01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.795
I'm sure you are.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.794
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:46.240
I've read more than
you've asked me to.

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.229
And I'm on
top of everything...

01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:53.393
I'm talking about
going the extra mile.

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:56.359
Unless you want me

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.754
to compete with
Christian Grey

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.352
for your attention.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:08.194
I apologize that Christian was so
curt with you the other night.

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.918
Is that what
this is about?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.350
Your boyfriend has
a reputation for being

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.877
a little ruthless.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.712
Is that what you like?

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.935
If you have a problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.995
Whoa.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.830
Why are you being
so serious?

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:29.920
What do you think I'm gonna do?
Make you fuck me?

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:31.120
Jack.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.671
I just think...

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:36.756
I just think

01:08:38.080 --> 01:08:40.354
if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence,

01:08:40.439 --> 01:08:45.434
then you should do it with someone
who can at least make you smarter.

01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.712
Not just richer.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:50.080
Right?

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:53.716
Don't...
Don't what? Hmm?

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:59.398
Look, this is a serious,
serious question.

01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.551
Do you wanna be kept

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.716
or taken seriously?
Hmm?

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.870
I would like to leave,
please, Jack.

01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:11.229
Plus...

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:18.554
I can make you come
like nobody else has.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.238
Not him.

01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.398
Not anyone.

01:09:23.479 --> 01:09:24.479
No.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:36.792
Ana?
Ana, what happened?

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.750
Jack Hyde
tried to touch me.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:42.840
I'll kill him.

01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:45.354
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:46.714
Okay. Go.

01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:47.948
It's okay. Hey...

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.111
I left everything.
I don't have any of my stuff.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.837
Taylor will get it.
It's fine, okay?

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.433
I'll take you home,
come on.

01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:57.114
And his pass
has been cancelled?

01:09:57.640 --> 01:09:58.640
Good.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.789
No. Thank you, Jerry.
Good night.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.037
Well, at least
that's dealt with.

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:10.589
Hyde's out.
He's been fired.

01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:11.680
Whoa.

01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:15.633
How? That's...

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.189
But I thought your deal with
SIP hasn't been finished yet.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:23.148
It's not.
But I know the CEO.

01:10:24.360 --> 01:10:25.998
I told him what happened.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.472
You'll never have to
see him again.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:32.194
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.756
Well, if you don't,
you can just...

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.593
Christian, you know
I love working.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.714
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.592
What if I gave you a key?

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.240
I mean,

01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.911
what if you had a key, and you
kept some of your stuff here?

01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:00.234
Keep all of your stuff here
and you slept, you know...

01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:02.237
Not at your place.

01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:07.877
Are you asking me
to move in with you?

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.240
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:14.874
Are you sure?

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:16.235
Yes.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.031
I want you here
all the time.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.518
As soon as possible.

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.957
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?

01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:38.194
That's just one of the many things that
we could talk about over breakfast.

01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.759
Can I think about it?

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.073
Sure.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:49.400
Yeah.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.389
Liz, hi!

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.597
Ana, don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
In kind of a hurry.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:07.316
SIP isn't recruiting
right now, so we're screwed.

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:09.356
So you don't need me
anymore then?

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:11.317
I'm gonna try to find you
something temporary.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.914
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.718
At the senior editors'
meeting?

01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:16.915
Just for today.

01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.960
You're the only one
who knows Jack's entire slate.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:21.116
Well, yeah, but, I...

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.158
You're right.
It's too much.

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:30.269
No, I can do it.

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.916
It's fine. I can do it.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.469
Great.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.433
Call me when you're done.

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:44.998
We need to print
fewer titles.

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.673
Stick with
established authors.

01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:48.632
Focus on our
core readership.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.955
Expand it.

01:12:51.040 --> 01:12:52.040
I'm sorry?

01:12:53.360 --> 01:12:56.193
Um, uh... So, Ana, what do you
think we should be publishing?

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:01.150
Um, newer voices.

01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:03.635
Along with your established authors.
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.679
Boyce Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120
Really?

01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:12.948
Online hits don't automatically
translate to print sales.

01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.475
Well, but they could.

01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:18.359
His online audience
is an 18-to-24 demographic,

01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:22.035
and those are exactly the readers
that we should be chasing.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.519
Um, I mean, I can show you the stats.
I think he's worth taking a risk on.

01:13:28.680 --> 01:13:30.511
Maybe we should take a look.

01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:41.993
Great idea.

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:45.675
Uh, Ana? Ana, just...

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.479
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.

01:13:48.640 --> 01:13:50.676
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.

01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.837
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:59.871
Um, well, Liz mentioned something
temporary. I don't know.

01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:02.713
Okay. So why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.351
Good?
Um...

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.395
Great. Okay.
That's settled.

01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:01.231
To SIP's
new fiction editor.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.231
Acting fiction editor.

01:15:03.960 --> 01:15:05.791
Till they find out
how good you are.

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.996
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?

01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.911
No. Hey, it was all you.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.668
What? You don't
believe me?

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.910
I don't believe it myself.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:26.992
I asked you a question
last night.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.314
About moving in with you?
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.788
I just think that
I'm probably...

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:42.596
I need to get some things
from my apartment.

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.673
That can be arranged.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:49.269
Good.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.350
Now, maybe we could

01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.470
take this celebration home.

01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:00.473
The check, please.

01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.119
Take off your panties.

01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.474
Do it now.

01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:18.235
Right in here?

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.311
Yeah, right here. Now.

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:22.469
Go on.

01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:01.440
Hmm.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.629
Excuse me.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:10.920
Don't come.

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.917
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.233
Two minutes.
Are you kidding?

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:51.958
In the bedroom.
Are you joking?

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.554
Two minutes.

01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:29.999
What are you
doing in here?

01:19:31.960 --> 01:19:33.439
You made me wait,

01:19:34.520 --> 01:19:35.999
so now it's your turn.

01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:43.519
Are you any good?

01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:49.872
Hmm. We'll see.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:53.952
Maybe we should make a bet.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.678
If I win,

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.839
you take me
to the red room.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:03.708
And if I win?

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:06.909
Your choice.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.674
Break.

01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:25.914
Okay.

01:20:43.800 --> 01:20:45.153
Mmm. Solids.

01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:39.674
Oh, dear.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.039
Side pocket.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.711
Red room, here we come.

01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.640
Oof.

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.994
Shit.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:04.518
I hope you're
not a sore loser.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.110
That depends on
how hard you spank me.

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:24.317
I want to be
very rough with you.

01:23:24.400 --> 01:23:26.595
So be rough with me.

01:23:54.960 --> 01:23:57.838
And Jada needs someone
to sign off on the new Carusi.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.109
I kept asking Jack
to do that.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:03.111
Yeah, well, Jack was
kind of lazy.

01:24:03.280 --> 01:24:04.474
Didn't you notice?

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:05.795
Yeah.

01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.269
I believe he called it
"artistic temperament."

01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840
Thank you, Hannah.

01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:14.680
Yep.

01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:19.800
Hey,

01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:22.715
it's great that
you're doing this, but...

01:24:22.800 --> 01:24:25.917
It's totally weird,
I know. I know.

01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:29.193
I mean, am I expected
to call you Miss Steele?

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:31.795
I expect you
to call me Ana.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.195
And I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee

01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:36.794
unless you're getting
some for yourself.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:44.159
And the rest of it, we'll
just make up as we go, okay?

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.634
Okay.

01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:04.275
Miss Steele.

01:25:08.120 --> 01:25:09.235
Damn it.

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:12.595
Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check the mail.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:13.749
I should go up with you.

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.399
No, it's okay.
I'll be two seconds.

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.640
Take it.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.880
Hey, Ros.

01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:02.669
Leila.

01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:09.517
Christian is downstairs.

01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.035
Do you wanna see him?

01:26:15.840 --> 01:26:17.751
I came to see you.

01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.080
Okay.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.392
He told me what happened.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.237
I know you're in
a lot of pain.

01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:36.354
I'm so sorry.

01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:39.635
He lets you call him
by his name.

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:44.272
He talks about you
all the time.

01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.194
He cares about you.

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:51.719
Don't lie.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.151
Tell me what you have
that I don't.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:26:59.719
Nothing.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.679
I'm nothing.

01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:07.714
He'll get tired of me.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:10.477
Master sleeps in your bed.

01:27:11.440 --> 01:27:13.795
How do you know that?
I saw you.

01:27:14.920 --> 01:27:16.194
I watched you.

01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:18.998
I know you love him.

01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:20.759
I do, too.

01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:22.909
We all do.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.480
Why don't you
put the gun down?

01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:28.273
You don't know him
or what he likes.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:30.760
You don't give him what he wants.
He's pretending with you.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.475
No, Christian.

01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:10.000
Kneel.

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.514
Ana...

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.878
Go to Escala.
Wait for me there.

01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.353
For once, just do
as you're told.

01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:47.077
Taylor, get her
out of here.

01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:01.714
Miss Steele.

01:29:08.080 --> 01:29:10.071
Miss Steele. Ana!

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.633
Stop it, Taylor.

01:30:39.920 --> 01:30:41.399
I don't care.

01:30:42.520 --> 01:30:46.752
She's been gone for three hours, and she
doesn't have her cell or her purse.

01:30:50.760 --> 01:30:52.239
Forget it. She's here.

01:30:56.840 --> 01:30:58.717
Where the fuck
have you been?

01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:03.677
I told you to come
straight here.

01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:06.080
I've had people out combing
the streets, looking for you.

01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:08.714
I'm sorry I don't always
do as I'm told.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:13.074
Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.

01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.514
Don't be ridiculous.

01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:16.272
I saw you, Christian.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:18.556
I saw the way
you were with Leila.

01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.551
She had a gun, Ana.

01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.712
I would have done
anything to subdue her.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.238
Where is she now?

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.160
Is she here?

01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.355
What?

01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:30.919
No, of course not.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:33.389
She's in the psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.908
Look, I know
she scared you...

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:40.798
Yeah. She scared me.

01:31:42.280 --> 01:31:44.555
But you scared me more.

01:31:45.440 --> 01:31:47.829
Seeing you like that
with her.

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:53.836
I'll never be able to give you that
kind of submission and obedience.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:55.320
Ana.

01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:58.598
Don't crowd me.
I need space.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.557
No, please don't do this.
Christian.

01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.598
Don't give up on me.
I just need to think a little bit.

01:32:04.200 --> 01:32:05.952
Don't leave me.

01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.038
What are you doing?

01:32:12.400 --> 01:32:13.549
Get up.

01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:18.473
What are you doing?

01:32:19.120 --> 01:32:20.348
Look at me.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.474
Look at me.

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:31.673
I'm scared.

01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:38.869
I know you say
that I'm enough.

01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.833
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting

01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:49.193
that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.

01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:55.069
And it might be fine
for right now,

01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:58.229
but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.320
I won't.

01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:01.118
How do you know that?

01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.315
How can I believe you?

01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:04.516
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

01:33:04.640 --> 01:33:06.437
I'm not a Dominant.

01:33:07.160 --> 01:33:08.354
I'm not.

01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.351
The right term is a sadist.

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.399
I get off on punishing women.
Women who look like you...

01:33:15.480 --> 01:33:17.118
Like your mother.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.760
Yes.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:22.830
And I know
how fucked up that is.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.233
When you left,

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:30.517
I swore that I would stop it if
that's what it took to get you back.

01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:33.677
But I'm done with it.

01:33:34.680 --> 01:33:37.638
You mean more to me
than anything else.

01:33:40.760 --> 01:33:43.797
I wanna
believe you. I do.

01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:45.108
But I can't.

01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:46.758
Ana, give me your hand.

01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:51.999
This is me.

01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:55.108
All of me.

01:33:56.280 --> 01:33:57.280
Christian.

01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.152
And I'm all yours.

01:35:01.560 --> 01:35:02.560
No.

01:35:06.400 --> 01:35:07.400
No!

01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.349
Hey. Hey, hey.
No.

01:35:11.520 --> 01:35:13.476
It's okay.
I'm right here.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:15.799
I'm right here.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:22.109
Marry me.

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.120
What?

01:35:25.160 --> 01:35:26.912
I want you to marry me.

01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:32.429
Christian, I think
you're dreaming.

01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:37.789
Good morning.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.315
Morning.

01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:44.269
Sleep okay?

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:46.996
I did. You?

01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.829
Like a log.
Out all night.

01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:50.920
Hmm.

01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:59.520
You didn't have any
weird dreams or anything?

01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:02.271
Or, like, wake up at all?

01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:03.440
No.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:05.833
I mean,
none that I can think of.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.920
Hmm.

01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:10.394
I mean, there was a little thing
of asking you to marry me,

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:12.357
but aside from that, no.
Nothing.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.510
Don't mess with me
like that.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:17.598
No? How should I
mess with you?

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:20.031
Like this? Huh?

01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.349
Is that better?

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:28.954
I meant it.

01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:32.397
I wanna marry you.

01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:34.469
Why?

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.476
Because I wanna spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.

01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:50.473
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.

01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.993
I know I'm complicated.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.993
Just a little bit.

01:38:01.920 --> 01:38:03.296
You have an assistant?

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.072
I thought you were
an assistant.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.595
It's a long story.
What's going on?

01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.989
What do I get Christian
for his birthday?

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.709
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:15.840
Uh...

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:19.191
His birthday?
When is his birthday?

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.193
Sunday. He didn't tell you?
He is so weird.

01:38:22.520 --> 01:38:24.192
Mom and Dad
are throwing him a party.

01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.588
Didn't they just
have a party?

01:38:25.760 --> 01:38:27.512
Jeez, you're as bad as he is.

01:38:27.680 --> 01:38:28.680
That was a ball.

01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:31.678
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.269
No biggie.
Hey, what about a tie?

01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:36.112
Uh, uh...

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.031
Christian has a lot of ties.

01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:40.555
- Socks, suspenders?
- Throw me a bone here?

01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:41.640
Um, oh...

01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.233
God, Mia, I gotta go.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:47.029
Okay, okay. But Sunday,
or I'll hunt you down myself. Bye.

01:38:49.680 --> 01:38:51.636
Ooh, perfect.

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:00.869
Do you have a gift box?

01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:01.995
One second.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000
Hey.

01:39:14.080 --> 01:39:15.559
Miss Steele.
Hmm.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:16.755
How was your day?

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:19.156
Looking up, Mr. Grey.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.514
Where's Taylor?

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.597
He went to get my bag.

01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.910
Your bag?
Where are you going?

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.913
Ros and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.

01:39:28.080 --> 01:39:29.433
I'll be back tomorrow night.

01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:31.549
Come on.

01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:35.149
When were you going to tell
me about your birthday?

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:40.233
Your parents are
throwing you a party.

01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:42.118
Were we just
gonna stay home?

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:44.757
They do this every year.

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:46.239
Um, yeah. Birthday.

01:39:48.400 --> 01:39:52.598
My, uh, arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.

01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:55.874
Well, I feel like
celebrating it.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:00.276
Can't open it
till the day though.

01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:03.872
Then why give it
to me now?

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:07.635
Call it delayed
gratification.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:15.598
Is that...
Is that Mount St. Helens?

01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:19.794
I changed the flight plan,
get us home sooner.

01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:24.637
Great. You realize
that's a volcano, right?

01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:28.237
Relax, Ros. If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.

01:41:28.320 --> 01:41:29.320
Ah.

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:31.279
Lucky me.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.594
Christian, what is that?

01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:44.795
Don't worry.

01:41:48.880 --> 01:41:50.677
Oh, my God! Christian!

01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.715
Shit.

01:41:57.240 --> 01:41:59.276
Shit. Christian,
what is going on?

01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.590
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
What is happening?

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.509
Damn it.
Oh, my God.

01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:07.394
Oh, my God, Christian!

01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:15.349
Stop it!

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:30.279
Christian!

01:42:41.040 --> 01:42:42.360
There.
There, there, there, there!

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:10.234
Oh, you remember this guy?

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.469
Kate!

01:43:15.400 --> 01:43:16.400
Hi!

01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:20.109
Oh, my God!
You're so tan and glowy.

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.389
You want a beer, Ana?

01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.993
Yes! Please. Please.

01:43:23.480 --> 01:43:24.515
Hi, José.
Hey.

01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:26.716
Hi! How's it going?

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:29.713
So? Congratulations,
Fiction Editor.

01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.836
Right?
She's a big deal now.

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:33.797
And how's, uh,
your hottie?

01:43:34.680 --> 01:43:36.511
Uh, Christian is good.

01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.999
Um, uh...

01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:39.593
He asked me to
move in with him.

01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.795
What?

01:43:41.960 --> 01:43:43.518
Ana's moving in
with Christian.

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:44.715
Oh, that's great.

01:43:44.880 --> 01:43:46.950
You know, we could
use the privacy.

01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:49.909
He's so subtle,
it kills me.

01:43:50.080 --> 01:43:51.149
Stop.

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:54.868
So you're serious. But are you happy?

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.439
'Cause that's
all I care about.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:59.956
I mean, it's complicated,
but I've never been happier.

01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.080
Hey, Mia, what's up?

01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:05.236
Did you hear about José's show?
It was incredible.

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.753
Really. He was amazing.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.560
He got rave reviews.
I gotta check it out.

01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:10.597
Wait, wait, Mia.
Slow down.

01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.479
Shit. Okay. Yeah, yeah,
we're on our way.

01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:19.154
Um, Christian's chopper went missing
on the way back from Portland.

01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.595
They're sending out
search parties right now.

01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.072
Come on, let's go.

01:44:24.480 --> 01:44:26.816
For more on this breaking
story, let's go out to the field

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:28.512
and our reporter,
Rachel Taylor.

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:30.398
Rachel?
Thank you, John.

01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:33.677
I'm speaking to you live from the private
helicopter terminal at Seattle...

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.309
They'll find him. He'll be okay.
It's Christian.

01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:41.352
The helicopter was
an Airbus helicopter H-130...

01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:42.999
Is there anything
we can do?

01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:46.435
And Christian Grey,
although only 27 years old,

01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:47.760
had extensive
flying experience.

01:44:47.800 --> 01:44:48.800
All right, bye.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.438
One of Seattle's youngest
billionaires,

01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:53.796
Grey's the charismatic head
of Grey Enterprises Holdings,

01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:55.518
a multinational
conglomerate...

01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:57.472
Jesus! Will someone
shut them up?

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.319
No, please. Leave it on.

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:01.959
Just turn it down
please, José.

01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:03.959
Thank you.

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.879
You're shivering.
I'll get you a sweater, okay?

01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:14.552
Ana. Tea.

01:45:19.560 --> 01:45:21.039
He's gonna be fine.

01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:23.438
He has to be okay.

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.631
We haven't had any time.

01:45:30.120 --> 01:45:32.429
We need to have more time.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.799
You're going to have
plenty of time.

01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:40.195
We're so glad that
you're here with us

01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:42.232
and in Christian's life.

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:46.872
You've made such
a difference to him.

01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:54.989
He never let anyone get
close until you came along.

01:45:57.520 --> 01:45:59.431
Grace, he adores you.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.589
I know,

01:46:00.680 --> 01:46:05.276
but children grow apart from
their parents, and that's fine,

01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:07.396
as long as they're happy.

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.399
And he is happy
with you.

01:46:15.000 --> 01:46:16.797
And that's all
I ever wanted.

01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.656
Turn it up.

01:46:18.680 --> 01:46:23.595
Christian Grey and his colleague
Ros Bailey have been found safe and well

01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.439
and are, at this moment,
on their way back to Seattle.

01:46:28.280 --> 01:46:29.998
What the hell
are you all doing here?

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.912
Christian?
Oh, my God!

01:46:32.880 --> 01:46:34.871
Christian!
How did you get here?

01:46:35.440 --> 01:46:36.589
Later, Mia.

01:46:37.080 --> 01:46:39.753
What happened? Oh, my God!
Why didn't you call?

01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:41.720
I had an accident.
I lost my phone.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:43.671
We know.
It's been all over the news.

01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:45.591
I'm fine.
Ros is fine.

01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:48.717
Dad, he's here.
He just walked in.

01:46:48.880 --> 01:46:51.075
I'm okay. He looks like shit,
but he's in one piece.

01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:52.957
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.475
Guys, relax. I'm fine.

01:46:54.560 --> 01:46:55.754
Come here, man.

01:46:57.400 --> 01:46:59.072
Need to say hi to my girl.
Okay.

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:00.160
Come on, Mom.

01:47:03.520 --> 01:47:04.936
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.

01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:06.075
Miss me?

01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:18.635
Oh, my God.

01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:24.673
I thought...
Hey, hey, Ana...

01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:27.513
It's all right.
Ana, I'm here.

01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.036
I was so scared.
I was so scared.

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.157
I thought
I lost you forever.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.718
Not a chance.

01:47:40.720 --> 01:47:41.720
I'm here.

01:47:46.680 --> 01:47:48.600
That's when
all my instruments lit up.

01:47:49.320 --> 01:47:52.357
- Had a fire in the tail, lost both engines.
- Both of them?

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.391
Yeah. Thank you.

01:47:57.720 --> 01:48:00.678
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.

01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:04.958
We hit them pretty hard, but luckily we
were both able to crawl out of there.

01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:07.118
Thank goodness.

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.113
Thank God.

01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.557
Sorry, guys, but
I gotta take off.

01:48:15.520 --> 01:48:16.748
Okay.

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:21.839
José, thanks for being here.
Means the world to Ana.

01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:24.070
Of course.
Hey...

01:48:24.600 --> 01:48:27.034
Welcome home, Mr. Grey.
Christian, please.

01:48:28.560 --> 01:48:31.757
Well, it's late, and these
two should get some rest.

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:33.912
Grace, shall we?
Yes.

01:48:34.000 --> 01:48:35.536
Yeah, I think we're gonna
head home too, bro.

01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:36.629
Cool.

01:48:36.720 --> 01:48:38.392
We'll
walk you guys.

01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:44.115
Kinda hate to say this,
but your guy's all right.

01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:47.272
I'm glad he's okay,
and I'm glad you're happy.

01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:51.030
Thank you. Will we be seeing
you tomorrow at his party?

01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:53.076
Don't push it.

01:48:56.480 --> 01:48:57.549
Come here.

01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:00.909
Careful.

01:49:01.080 --> 01:49:02.479
I know.

01:49:02.680 --> 01:49:04.432
Mom.
Okay.

01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:08.440
We'll see you
tomorrow, Ana.

01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.640
Good night.

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.668
It's after midnight.

01:49:18.720 --> 01:49:20.358
I'm not tired.

01:49:20.520 --> 01:49:21.589
No.

01:49:22.480 --> 01:49:23.708
It's your birthday.

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:27.793
Yeah.

01:49:29.720 --> 01:49:30.994
Happy birthday.

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:32.989
Thank you.

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:38.594
Do you still have
that gift I gave you?

01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:41.800
Yes.

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:55.237
You know
you didn't have to.

01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.553
All I want is you.

01:49:57.720 --> 01:49:59.392
Just open it.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.795
Okay.

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.833
Keychain.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.752
Turn it over.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:22.636
Does this mean yes, yes?

01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:23.989
Yes.

01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.994
Yes, yes, yes.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.309
Wait!

01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:37.716
So this whole time I had
the answer in my pocket?

01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.472
Anastasia Steele...

01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:44.916
What am I gonna
do with you?

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:18.551
Take me to the red room.

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:19.835
Take me...

01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:21.399
Take me to the red room.

01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.519
Are you sure?
Yes.

01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:25.600
Yes.

01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:02.833
I love you.

01:54:10.400 --> 01:54:11.879
Well, I love you.

01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:16.158
Hello?
Mom? Hi.

01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:20.269
Ana, sweetheart.
Where have you been?

01:54:21.120 --> 01:54:25.193
I know. I've been... I'm sorry.
Work has been so crazy.

01:54:25.600 --> 01:54:27.477
I hope they're not
overworking you?

01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:31.190
No, no. It's actually...
It's going really well.

01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:37.279
Um, but I was calling because I, um... I
wanted to talk to you about Christian.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:40.155
Christian?
You've heard from him?

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:43.517
Yeah. We got back together.

01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:50.110
Honey, that's wonderful! This time
it's going to last. I know it is.

01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:54.111
I hope you're right,
because, um...

01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:59.238
He asked me to marry him,
and I said yes.

01:55:05.240 --> 01:55:06.309
Mom?

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.158
You're not...
No, no, I'm not pregnant.

01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:12.000
Um...

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.479
I know that we haven't
been together very long,

01:55:20.120 --> 01:55:22.315
but I love him so much.

01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:26.878
He's the one.

01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:30.550
Oh, sweetheart!
I'm so happy for you!

01:55:30.800 --> 01:55:32.916
You are?
Of course.

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:35.560
You've always
known your own mind.

01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.679
If that man is the love of your life,
you grab him with both hands.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:42.873
Thanks, Mama.

01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.356
Have you called Ray?
Um, no, not yet.

01:55:46.760 --> 01:55:50.753
Um... Christian did, though.
He asked for his permission.

01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:55.158
He asked for your hand?
That's so chivalrous.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.640
Hey.

01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:23.480
Hey.

01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.875
Champagne, Mr. Grey?

01:56:25.080 --> 01:56:26.308
Thanks, Gretchen.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.517
And can I just say,
happy birthday?

01:56:30.040 --> 01:56:31.712
Sure. Thank you.

01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:36.832
Christian.
Mom.

01:56:37.560 --> 01:56:38.959
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

01:56:40.320 --> 01:56:41.389
And Ana.
Hi.

01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:43.311
It's so good to
see you again.

01:56:43.480 --> 01:56:45.914
You saw us last night.

01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:47.000
Yes.

01:56:47.160 --> 01:56:48.388
And because of that

01:56:48.600 --> 01:56:52.275
I am never taking anything for granted.
Ever again.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:53.794
Hey!

01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:55.871
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:57.712
I'm fine, Elena.
Thank you.

01:56:57.800 --> 01:56:59.153
Oh!

01:56:59.280 --> 01:57:02.955
Ana, let me introduce to you,
my good friend, Elena Lincoln.

01:57:03.160 --> 01:57:05.071
We met at the masquerade.

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.549
Yes.
Nice to see you again.

01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:10.760
Excuse us.

01:57:10.960 --> 01:57:11.995
Surely.

01:57:12.800 --> 01:57:14.074
She's fantastic.

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:24.118
Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.

01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.637
I wanna thank you all
for coming here this evening.

01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:31.400
I was expecting
a small family gathering.

01:57:31.480 --> 01:57:32.754
Thanks, Mia.

01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:34.520
But I'm happy
that you're all here

01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:36.955
because I have
an announcement to make.

01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.351
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.

01:57:43.520 --> 01:57:47.399
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:49.915
and how important it is
to seize the day.

01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:54.436
We should cherish the people we
care about and who care about us.

01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:01.312
Mom, Dad, I know I haven't
always been the perfect son.

01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:05.716
But I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.

01:58:12.640 --> 01:58:14.198
But that's not
the announcement.

01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:17.672
Ana, come up here
a second, please.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:31.389
So, a while ago, I was lucky enough
to meet this amazing young woman,

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:33.152
Anastasia Steele.

01:58:33.560 --> 01:58:36.393
And very quickly,
I realized that she was the one

01:58:36.480 --> 01:58:37.913
I wanted to
share my life with.

01:58:38.720 --> 01:58:42.759
So I asked her to marry me,
and she said yes.

01:58:43.520 --> 01:58:45.954
Oh! That is so...

01:58:57.120 --> 01:58:58.758
I am thrilled, Ana.

01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:01.736
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

01:59:01.760 --> 01:59:04.957
If I cry any more,
I'm just going to dehydrate.

01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:06.519
Oh, my God!
Don't do that.

01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:07.749
Congratulations.

01:59:07.920 --> 01:59:09.035
Stop crying, Mom.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:10.753
Can't help it.
I love you so much.

01:59:10.920 --> 01:59:12.148
I love you.

01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:15.280
Hi! Well done,
big brother!

01:59:16.480 --> 01:59:18.152
Ring! Show me the ring.

01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.360
Oh, we're gonna
choose it together.

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.159
No rock.
Christian Grey.

01:59:23.600 --> 01:59:25.750
Oh, my God!
I have a sister!

01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.239
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks, and this is what happens?

01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:43.828
I know! I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:45.513
Oh, please. Come here.

01:59:46.160 --> 01:59:48.276
Oh!

01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:52.149
So, how does it feel to bag
Seattle's most eligible bachelor?

01:59:52.320 --> 01:59:54.197
It's a little scary,
but...

01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:56.396
Well, if anyone can
make it work, it's you.

01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.837
Hey, sis-in-law!

01:59:59.680 --> 02:00:02.558
Congratulations.
Christian's a very lucky guy.

02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:06.790
You, however, are certifiably insane.

02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:08.029
I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:10.080
Mia wants to taste one of
your killer cocktails.

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.191
Oh, well, coming right up.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.600
I see you heeded
our little talk.

02:00:22.160 --> 02:00:24.390
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?

02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:26.551
You don't care
about Christian.

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.869
He'll see that.

02:00:28.040 --> 02:00:29.519
I'll make sure of it.

02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.557
He'll see
right through you.

02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:34.597
It's over for you, Elena.

02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.917
You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.

02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.395
He's not capable
of marriage.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.559
Thank you, Christian.

02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:50.798
Why are you
even here, Elena?

02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.233
She's not right for you.

02:00:53.400 --> 02:00:55.231
You don't know
what's right for me.

02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:57.436
You taught me
how to fuck, Elena.

02:00:57.640 --> 02:00:59.073
Ana taught me
how to love.

02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:01.913
She's just
the next one in line.

02:01:02.560 --> 02:01:04.232
Get out of my house.

02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:12.029
Leave my children alone,
and get the hell out of my house.

02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:26.279
Ana, darling...

02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:31.633
Would you give us
a moment alone, please?

02:02:00.840 --> 02:02:01.989
I'm sorry about that.

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.514
Is your mom okay?

02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:10.592
Furious.
Hmm.

02:02:11.440 --> 02:02:12.953
Elena's gone.

02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.119
Like, gone, gone?

02:02:15.280 --> 02:02:16.429
I'm done.

02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:18.876
The business. Everything.

02:02:19.040 --> 02:02:21.554
I'll have my people sort
out the details tomorrow.

02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:26.035
I know she was
important to you.

02:02:26.480 --> 02:02:27.674
I'm sorry.

02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:31.000
Are you?

02:02:31.040 --> 02:02:32.359
No.
No.

02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:37.193
What's that you got there?

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:54.993
Come with me. There's
something I need to show you.

02:02:58.200 --> 02:03:01.317
Last time we came down here,
I was over your shoulder.

02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.109
Oh, yeah.

02:03:20.240 --> 02:03:21.559
After you.

02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:34.918
Oh, my God!

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.988
You wanted
hearts and flowers.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.195
Oh, my God!

02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:40.280
It's okay.

02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:41.988
It's okay.

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.594
Christian...

02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:54.078
This is amazing.

02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:02.759
Be mine.

02:04:04.440 --> 02:04:06.032
Share my life with me.

02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:08.955
Yes.

02:04:09.520 --> 02:04:10.589
Marry me.

02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:15.798
I'll marry you.

02:04:16.120 --> 02:04:18.395
Give me your hand.

02:04:32.880 --> 02:04:34.233
Did you do that?

02:04:48.800 --> 02:04:50.631
Great, isn't it?
That's so pretty.

02:04:51.640 --> 02:04:52.640
Oh!

02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:01.959
I solemnly vow

02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:05.237
to love you faithfully

02:09:06.120 --> 02:09:09.112
and to keep you safe for as
long as we both shall live.
