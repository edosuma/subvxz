00:05.291 --> 00:10.250
Narrator:
<i> Previously on</i>
<i> "The American West"...</i>

00:10.250 --> 00:13.500
<i> The country is rapidly</i>
<i> settling the frontier,</i>

00:13.500 --> 00:15.333
<i> but with</i>
<i> a growing population</i>

00:15.333 --> 00:18.291
<i> comes lawless boomtowns...</i>

00:18.291 --> 00:21.208
-<i> where crime runs rampant. </i>
- Cheater, huh?

00:23.166 --> 00:25.291
Narrator:
<i> In the town of Dodge City,</i>

00:25.291 --> 00:28.208
<i> the new Deputy Marshal</i>
<i> Wyatt Earp</i>

00:28.208 --> 00:30.709
<i> is making use</i>
<i> of his natural ability</i>

00:30.709 --> 00:35.291
<i> to keep the peace</i>
<i> in the chaotic West.</i>

00:35.291 --> 00:38.375
<i> Meanwhile,</i>
<i> in the territory</i>
<i> of New Mexico,</i>

00:38.375 --> 00:41.083
<i> a new breed of outlaw</i>
<i> is on the rise.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:45.500
<i> After years on his own,</i>
<i> Billy the Kid</i>

00:45.500 --> 00:47.792
<i> finally finds a place</i>
<i> to belong</i>

00:47.792 --> 00:52.125
<i> when he's hired by</i>
<i> cattle rancher John Tunstall.</i>

00:52.125 --> 00:55.375
<i> But when Tunstall is murdered</i>
<i> over a business dispute,</i>

00:55.375 --> 00:59.208
<i> Billy loses the only father</i>
<i> figure he's ever known...</i>

01:00.500 --> 01:04.125
<i> and vows to take down</i>
<i> everyone involved,</i>

01:04.125 --> 01:07.375
<i> setting the stage</i>
<i> for a new war in the West.</i>

01:09.291 --> 01:13.041
<i> ( theme music playing )</i>

02:06.500 --> 02:08.792
<i> In Lincoln County,</i>
<i> New Mexico,</i>

02:08.834 --> 02:11.458
<i> Billy the Kid is determined</i>
<i> to avenge the murder</i>

02:11.458 --> 02:15.625
<i> of his friend and mentor,</i>
<i> John Tunstall.</i>

02:22.625 --> 02:25.542
Kathleen Chamberlain:
<i> Billy was devastated when</i>
<i> Tunstall was killed.</i>

02:25.542 --> 02:28.709
<i> He got together</i>
<i> with his friends,</i>

02:28.750 --> 02:31.375
and the more they
talked about it,

02:31.375 --> 02:33.250
the more angry they became.

02:35.291 --> 02:37.291
Narrator:
<i> Tunstall's death</i>
<i> is orchestrated by</i>

02:37.291 --> 02:39.250
<i> a corrupt group</i>
<i> of wealthy businessmen</i>

02:39.291 --> 02:41.625
<i> known as "the House."</i>

02:41.625 --> 02:44.625
<i> The House has a hold on</i>
<i> everything in Lincoln County,</i>

02:44.625 --> 02:46.291
<i> including the law.</i>

02:48.375 --> 02:50.792
<i> With no one to turn to</i>
<i> for justice,</i>

02:50.792 --> 02:54.583
<i> Billy and a gang</i>
<i>of local citizens band together</i>

02:54.583 --> 02:57.458
<i> to take the law</i>
<i> into their own hands,</i>

02:57.458 --> 02:59.375
<i> forming a vigilante group</i>

02:59.375 --> 03:01.500
<i> known as "the Regulators."</i>

03:04.542 --> 03:07.208
Mark Lee Gardner:
<i> Billy and those loyal</i>
<i> to Tunstall</i>

03:07.208 --> 03:10.500
are going after every man
that was in that posse.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.333
Billy is going to fulfill

03:12.333 --> 03:15.709
<i> his vendetta</i>
<i> before he dies.</i>

03:17.834 --> 03:19.667
Narrator:
<i> At the top of</i>
<i> their hit list--</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:22.333
<i> the man responsible</i>
<i> for the murder of Tunstall,</i>

03:22.333 --> 03:24.834
<i> Sheriff William J. Brady.</i>

03:24.834 --> 03:27.333
Gardner:
<i> Sheriff Brady is working</i>
<i> for the House.</i>

03:27.333 --> 03:30.250
Brady, to Billy,
is just as culpable

03:30.250 --> 03:32.917
as any of those men
that murdered his friend.

04:03.917 --> 04:05.792
Here he comes.

04:22.375 --> 04:23.417
( gunshot )

04:25.417 --> 04:27.917
( gunshots )

05:07.625 --> 05:09.625
Billy:
<i> It sure is nice</i>
<i> to see you again...</i>

05:11.458 --> 05:13.375
Sheriff.

05:25.667 --> 05:28.542
Narrator:
<i> On April 1, 1878,</i>

05:28.542 --> 05:30.917
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> kills a member of the House</i>

05:30.917 --> 05:32.375
<i> in cold blood.</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:35.375
Paul Hutton:
<i> He kills...</i>

05:35.375 --> 05:36.959
<i> but he's a killer</i>
<i> for justice--</i>

05:36.959 --> 05:40.083
his sense
of "Gunsmoke" justice,

05:40.083 --> 05:42.083
<i> because the law is corrupt,</i>

05:42.083 --> 05:44.083
<i> and the law was totally,</i>
<i> irrevocably corrupt</i>

05:44.083 --> 05:46.417
<i> in territorial</i>
<i> New Mexico.</i>

05:49.500 --> 05:51.959
Narrator:
<i> For Billy, the killing</i>
<i> of Sheriff Brady</i>

05:51.959 --> 05:55.291
<i> is just the beginning.</i>

05:55.333 --> 05:58.000
Hutton:
<i> Now Billy is an outlaw.</i>

05:58.000 --> 05:59.583
That really is
the point of no return.

06:22.458 --> 06:24.875
Narrator:
<i> Over the span</i>
<i> of a month and a half,</i>

06:24.875 --> 06:27.333
<i> Billy and his gang</i>
<i> kill five more men</i>

06:27.333 --> 06:31.458
<i> involved</i>
<i> in Tunstall's death.</i>

06:31.500 --> 06:33.417
Kiefer Sutherland:
<i> Billy the Kid found the one</i>
<i> thing that he was good at,</i>

06:33.417 --> 06:35.083
<i> which was killing</i>
<i> other people,</i>

06:35.083 --> 06:37.667
and he got a lot
of attention for it
and he embraced it.

06:37.667 --> 06:39.834
<i> There's not a lot</i>
<i> of characters in the West</i>

06:39.834 --> 06:41.834
<i> as aggressive as that.</i>

06:43.709 --> 06:46.041
Narrator:
<i> Word of the violence</i>
<i> spreads quickly</i>

06:46.041 --> 06:48.959
<i> through the surrounding</i>
<i> counties.</i>

06:48.959 --> 06:51.667
<i> Now the small-time</i>
<i> cattle thief</i>

06:51.667 --> 06:55.500
<i> has become a feared,</i>
<i> cold-blooded murderer.</i>

06:55.500 --> 06:58.750
Gardner:
<i> When you kill the man</i>
<i> that represents law and order,</i>

06:58.750 --> 07:01.625
<i> that definitely</i>
<i> makes the newspapers.</i>

07:01.625 --> 07:03.750
Even if Sheriff Brady
is corrupt,

07:03.750 --> 07:05.917
he's still a sheriff.

07:05.917 --> 07:08.709
<i> He's still the elected sheriff</i>
<i> of Lincoln County.</i>

07:17.625 --> 07:21.000
Narrator:
<i> Twelve hundred miles away,</i>
<i> another outlaw</i>

07:21.000 --> 07:24.792
<i> who's become a hero</i>
<i> for the Confederate cause</i>

07:24.792 --> 07:27.001
<i> remains in hiding.</i>

07:37.917 --> 07:40.083
<i> In the years since</i>
<i> their disastrous bank robbery</i>

07:40.083 --> 07:41.750
<i> in Minnesota,</i>

07:41.750 --> 07:44.542
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> and his brother Frank</i>

07:44.542 --> 07:47.125
<i> have been keeping</i>
<i> a low profile.</i>

07:47.125 --> 07:51.458
<i> And now two of America's</i>
<i> most famous outlaws</i>

07:51.458 --> 07:53.834
<i> live under new identities</i>

07:53.834 --> 07:55.542
<i> working as farmers.</i>

07:55.542 --> 07:57.166
Gardner:
<i> Jesse and Frank</i>

07:57.166 --> 07:58.834
hide out in Tennessee
for a while

07:58.834 --> 08:00.667
and, you know,
"Maybe this is the time

08:00.667 --> 08:02.709
that we kinda give up
this crazy stuff

08:02.709 --> 08:04.583
and let's see if we
can make a living,

08:04.583 --> 08:06.625
<i> and maybe they'll</i>
<i> leave us alone."</i>

08:06.625 --> 08:08.542
Wanna see Dada?

08:08.542 --> 08:11.041
Gardner:
<i> They both have wives.</i>
<i> Jesse had two children.</i>

08:11.041 --> 08:13.959
When they're home,
they're good family men,

08:13.959 --> 08:17.583
when they're not at home,
they're not very good citizens.

08:17.583 --> 08:20.917
( baby crying )

08:23.125 --> 08:25.792
Narrator:
<i> But stories of</i>
<i> the new breed of outlaws</i>

08:25.792 --> 08:27.625
<i> wreaking havoc</i>
<i> in the West</i>

08:27.625 --> 08:31.583
<i> are now making news</i>
<i> nationwide.</i>

08:31.583 --> 08:36.000
<i> And Jesse James,</i>
<i> the most notorious criminal</i>
<i> of his time,</i>

08:36.000 --> 08:38.500
<i> is growing restless.</i>

08:43.709 --> 08:47.208
They're gonna be pullin'
all the troops
out of the South.

08:47.208 --> 08:49.125
And Missouri.

08:49.583 --> 08:51.875
It's about damn time.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.709
I wonder what kind of angle
they're working with that.

08:54.709 --> 08:56.834
I don't think
it's an angle.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.500
I think the war
is over.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.208
( chuckles )

09:10.542 --> 09:12.166
So what are we
gonna do now?

09:16.083 --> 09:20.625
We're gonna take care
of the farm, Jesse.

09:28.208 --> 09:30.208
Gardner:
<i> Jesse wasn't doing that well</i>

09:30.208 --> 09:33.208
trying to be
just a normal person,
a normal Joe.

09:42.250 --> 09:44.875
That life was so sedate

09:44.875 --> 09:48.125
compared to the rush
of the wind in your face

09:48.125 --> 09:50.291
<i> and the smell</i>
<i> of gunpowder</i>

09:50.291 --> 09:53.125
<i> and seeing the fear</i>
<i> in people's eyes.</i>

09:57.291 --> 09:59.250
I'll be back.
I promise.

10:02.166 --> 10:06.208
Gardner:
<i> So I think, for him,</i>
<i> the natural place to turn--</i>

10:06.208 --> 10:09.208
"I know how to rob trains,
I know how to rob banks."

10:17.083 --> 10:19.709
Narrator:
<i> After two years in hiding,</i>

10:19.709 --> 10:23.083
<i> Jesse James is going back</i>
<i> to a life of crime.</i>

10:52.333 --> 10:54.625
Narrator:
<i> After years of roaming</i>
<i> the West,</i>

10:54.625 --> 10:56.750
<i> looking to make his fortune,</i>

10:56.750 --> 11:00.083
<i> Wyatt Earp has finally</i>
<i> found himself a home...</i>

11:01.667 --> 11:04.208
<i> as deputy marshal</i>
<i> of Dodge City.</i>

11:08.792 --> 11:12.792
<i> With his imposing figure</i>
<i> and strongarm tactics,</i>

11:12.792 --> 11:14.834
<i> Wyatt's bringing</i>
<i> a new sense of order</i>

11:14.834 --> 11:16.917
<i> to the lawless frontier.</i>

11:19.250 --> 11:21.208
Ann Kirschner:
<i> Rather than use bullets,</i>

11:21.208 --> 11:23.792
<i> he was more likely</i>
<i> to use words.</i>

11:25.875 --> 11:29.208
<i> But if he really needed to,</i>
<i> he would pick up his pistol</i>

11:29.208 --> 11:31.792
and hit the offender
over the head with it.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.250
Very effective.

11:37.250 --> 11:41.917
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt averages nearly</i>
<i> 300 arrests a month.</i>

11:41.959 --> 11:45.375
<i> But soon he gets a case</i>
<i> that will change his outlook</i>

11:45.375 --> 11:47.333
<i> on justice in the West.</i>

11:52.125 --> 11:54.959
<i> In 1878, Dora Hand,</i>

11:55.001 --> 11:58.000
<i> a popular Dodge City</i>
<i> actress and singer,</i>

11:58.000 --> 12:01.959
<i> is murdered...</i>
<i> shocking the town.</i>

12:03.500 --> 12:05.500
<i> But despite Wyatt's</i>
<i> tireless efforts</i>

12:05.500 --> 12:10.291
<i> to seek justice</i>
<i> and overwhelming evidence,</i>

12:10.291 --> 12:13.041
<i> her murderer walks free</i>
<i> without a trial</i>

12:13.041 --> 12:15.917
<i> after his father,</i>
<i> a wealthy businessman,</i>

12:15.917 --> 12:18.500
<i> pays off local officials.</i>

12:35.001 --> 12:37.458
Bill Richardson:
<i> The American West</i>
<i> at the time</i>

12:37.458 --> 12:39.750
<i> was lawlessness.</i>

12:39.750 --> 12:42.375
<i> And there were</i>
<i> many violent acts</i>

12:42.375 --> 12:44.375
<i> that weren't prosecuted.</i>

12:46.875 --> 12:49.125
The court system
was not the best.

12:55.959 --> 12:58.000
Narrator:
<i> The case leaves Wyatt</i>
<i> questioning</i>

12:58.000 --> 13:00.250
<i> why he bothers</i>
<i> enforcing the law...</i>

13:02.041 --> 13:05.208
<i> in a town where</i>
<i> corruption runs so deep.</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:16.250
<i> Miles away</i>
<i> in a remote hideout</i>
<i> in Missouri...</i>

13:19.000 --> 13:22.250
<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> is planning his next heist.</i>

13:28.166 --> 13:32.291
Well, aren't you a sight
for sore eyes, brother?

13:32.291 --> 13:33.542
Looky there.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.583
Jesse, I ain't
comin' back.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.166
<i> I thought long</i>
<i> and hard now.</i>

14:04.250 --> 14:06.375
<i> And it's time.</i>

14:06.375 --> 14:08.208
What do you mean?

14:08.208 --> 14:09.917
What do you mean
you're not coming back?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.542
<i> We've been on the run</i>
<i> half our lives.</i>

14:12.542 --> 14:14.583
I'm tired.

14:17.250 --> 14:20.041
I'm sick and tired
of it, Jesse.

14:24.583 --> 14:26.917
I'm gonna be a husband.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.125
I'm gonna be a father.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.875
It ain't right
kids growing up
without no father.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.917
<i> You and I know that</i>
<i> better than most.</i>

14:46.375 --> 14:48.083
So you rode
all the way out here

14:48.083 --> 14:50.333
to tell me you're
quittin' on me?

14:51.875 --> 14:54.083
You want to be famous,

14:54.083 --> 14:56.041
or you want a family?

14:59.001 --> 15:01.083
<i> Go be with your son.</i>

15:05.583 --> 15:07.917
Well, I appreciate
you coming out.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.166
Gardner:
<i> Frank was just able</i>
<i> to adjust better</i>

15:28.166 --> 15:32.208
<i> to that civilian lifestyle</i>
<i> than Jesse was.</i>

15:32.208 --> 15:34.667
Frank has a son
by this time.

15:34.667 --> 15:38.001
I think he would prefer
to leave that life behind.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.500
Narrator:
<i> Jesse's already lost</i>

15:43.500 --> 15:47.125
<i> every other member</i>
<i> of his gang...</i>

15:47.125 --> 15:49.583
<i> and now with Frank</i>
<i> backing out,</i>

15:49.583 --> 15:53.250
<i> he'll have to rebuild</i>
<i> his life of crime</i>

15:53.250 --> 15:56.000
<i> on his own.</i>

15:59.000 --> 16:02.166
<i> Over 900 miles away...</i>

16:04.001 --> 16:07.667
<i> the murderous rampage</i>
<i> of Billy the Kid...</i>

16:07.667 --> 16:09.667
<i> that left</i>
<i> the Lincoln County sheriff</i>

16:09.667 --> 16:12.291
<i> and five other men dead</i>

16:12.291 --> 16:14.166
<i> is gaining the attention</i>

16:14.166 --> 16:17.250
<i> of New Mexico's</i>
<i> most prominent figures,</i>

16:17.250 --> 16:20.583
<i> including wealthy landowner</i>
<i> Thomas Catron.</i>

16:22.583 --> 16:25.000
David Eisenbach:
<i> Sheriff Brady was owned</i>
<i> by the House.</i>

16:25.000 --> 16:27.083
<i> He was indebted to them,</i>

16:27.083 --> 16:30.417
and he was abusing
his office as sheriff.

16:30.417 --> 16:34.583
<i> But killing a sheriff now</i>
<i> brings on all sorts of heat.</i>

16:34.583 --> 16:37.166
<i> You cannot kill</i>
<i> an officer of the law</i>

16:37.166 --> 16:39.333
<i> without the law</i>
<i> having to crack you.</i>

16:39.333 --> 16:41.291
Not necessarily 'cause
that officer was a good guy,

16:41.291 --> 16:45.250
but because he's a symbol
of the system.

16:52.125 --> 16:54.542
Narrator:
<i> After three months</i>
<i> of hunting,</i>

16:54.542 --> 16:57.333
<i> the House finally</i>
<i> tracks down Billy the Kid</i>

16:57.333 --> 16:59.458
-<i> and his gang... </i>
- Hyah!

17:08.333 --> 17:12.166
<i> ...and forces them to take</i>
<i> refuge in a nearby farmhouse.</i>

17:32.625 --> 17:35.083
Brewer:
<i> How long can we hold out?</i>

17:35.083 --> 17:37.625
Don't worry so much.

17:37.709 --> 17:38.750
This is the fun part.

17:42.375 --> 17:45.625
You know, they say
God created man,

17:45.625 --> 17:48.250
but Samuel Colt
made 'em equal.

17:53.667 --> 17:58.000
I have here a warrant
for the charge of murder

17:58.000 --> 18:00.667
in the death
of Sheriff William Brady!

( clicks )

18:09.542 --> 18:11.333
( clicks )

18:11.333 --> 18:14.542
This is your last chance, Billy.
Come out with your hands up!

18:16.667 --> 18:19.417
I don't believe
in last chances.

18:19.417 --> 18:23.250
So I guess, uh,
you can go to hell.

18:23.250 --> 18:26.417
Maybe I'll meet
you there, Billy!

18:26.417 --> 18:30.291
Billy had never suffered
a personal defeat.

18:30.291 --> 18:32.083
<i> Even if there'd been</i>
<i> a thousand men</i>

18:32.083 --> 18:34.333
<i> surrounding that building,</i>
<i> Billy, in his mind,</i>

18:34.333 --> 18:35.709
"You know,
we could probably do it."

18:50.500 --> 18:52.291
Narrator:
<i> To increase their manpower,</i>

18:52.291 --> 18:54.667
<i> the House calls in</i>
<i> the U.S. Army</i>

18:54.667 --> 18:57.417
<i> to help take down</i>
<i> the notorious outlaw.</i>

18:57.417 --> 18:59.750
It's not only
a column of soldiers,

18:59.750 --> 19:02.667
<i> but they have a very</i>
<i>formidable-looking Gatling gun.</i>

19:07.500 --> 19:10.375
I mean, what are you gonna do
against artillery?

19:14.667 --> 19:16.083
Deputy:
<i> Open fire!</i>

19:29.333 --> 19:33.333
Narrator:
<i> Surrounded by lawmen</i>
<i> and the U.S. Army,</i>

19:33.333 --> 19:36.083
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> and the rest of the Regulators</i>

19:36.083 --> 19:37.875
-<i> are trapped. </i>
- ( gun clicks )

19:42.625 --> 19:45.667
Your last chance, Billy!
Come out with your hands up!

19:47.667 --> 19:50.291
Go to hell, Deputy!

19:50.291 --> 19:51.750
( gun clicks )

19:51.750 --> 19:54.458
<i> Maybe I'll meet you</i>
<i> there, Billy!</i>

19:59.166 --> 20:00.750
( gun clicks )

20:00.750 --> 20:02.291
Billy, uh, had
a violent reputation.

20:06.375 --> 20:09.667
And they figured that he
wasn't gonna be taken easily.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.417
Open fire!

20:32.500 --> 20:35.500
Gardner:
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> is a man of action.</i>

20:38.417 --> 20:40.250
He wants to do something.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.250
<i> He doesn't want to be</i>
<i> holed up in this house</i>

20:42.250 --> 20:43.333
<i> where they're surrounded.</i>

20:54.417 --> 20:56.417
Narrator:
<i> With the odds</i>
<i> stacked against him...</i>

20:59.667 --> 21:02.291
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> does the unthinkable.</i>

21:18.542 --> 21:23.583
Gardner:
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> was well-known for escaping.</i>

21:23.583 --> 21:27.375
<i> And this was his</i>
<i> most sensational escape.</i>

21:27.417 --> 21:30.417
Being surrounded
by soldiers and gunmen

21:30.417 --> 21:32.500
and fleeing through
a hail of bullets...

21:34.542 --> 21:36.375
<i> that's quite an escape.</i>

21:38.834 --> 21:42.959
Narrator:
<i> Miraculously, Billy</i>
<i> gets away without a scratch.</i>

21:42.959 --> 21:46.542
<i> But the showdown</i>
<i> leaves seven people dead</i>

21:46.542 --> 21:49.834
<i> and becomes known</i>
<i> as "The Big Killing."</i>

21:54.709 --> 21:57.583
Chamberlain:
<i> The Big Killing</i>
<i> was seen as the epitome</i>

21:57.583 --> 22:03.500
of western anarchism
and Wild West violence.

22:05.959 --> 22:09.333
<i> It made huge headlines</i>
<i> across the West,</i>

22:09.333 --> 22:11.542
and as far east
as New York City.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.458
<i> It verified to everybody</i>

22:17.458 --> 22:19.959
<i> that the West,</i>
<i> and especially New Mexico,</i>

22:19.959 --> 22:25.667
was a place that
was beyond civilization.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.542
Narrator:
<i> As news spreads</i>
<i> of the disastrous showdown</i>

22:34.542 --> 22:37.709
<i> in Lincoln County,</i>

22:37.709 --> 22:40.375
<i> Billy the Kid knows</i>
<i> he's a hunted man.</i>

22:42.333 --> 22:46.001
<i>So he heads to the most lawless</i>
<i> city in the United States...</i>

22:48.917 --> 22:51.333
<i> Las Vegas, New Mexico.</i>

22:53.583 --> 22:55.625
<i> Like Dodge City before it,</i>

22:55.625 --> 22:58.583
<i> Las Vegas, New Mexico,</i>
<i> is a boomtown,</i>

22:58.583 --> 23:00.959
<i> meant to bring</i>
<i> big business west.</i>

23:03.458 --> 23:05.792
<i> But because</i>
<i> of its remote location</i>

23:05.792 --> 23:09.417
<i> and lack of a police force,</i>
<i> it attracts gunslingers,</i>

23:09.417 --> 23:12.125
<i> murderers,</i>
<i> and outlaws instead.</i>

23:13.750 --> 23:16.500
<i> The killings rage</i>
<i> out of control,</i>

23:16.500 --> 23:19.125
<i> at one point</i>
<i> reaching a murder a day.</i>

23:21.041 --> 23:22.750
<i> And the city becomes known</i>

23:22.750 --> 23:25.375
<i> as the "most dangerous place</i>
<i> in the West."</i>

23:37.500 --> 23:39.792
( patrons chattering )

23:42.125 --> 23:43.875
What'll you have?

23:43.875 --> 23:45.667
Whiskey.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.917
Narrator:
<i> It's the perfect place</i>

23:52.917 --> 23:54.750
<i> for a wanted man like Billy</i>
<i> to hide out.</i>

23:56.750 --> 23:59.001
<i> But what he doesn't realize</i>

23:59.001 --> 24:03.041
<i> is that there's another</i>
<i>infamous outlaw in Las Vegas...</i>

24:03.041 --> 24:05.709
<i> determined</i>
<i> to track him down.</i>

24:27.667 --> 24:30.083
Narrator:
<i> Billy the Kid is hiding out</i>
<i> in the lawless town</i>

24:30.083 --> 24:34.875
<i> of Las Vegas, New Mexico.</i>

24:34.875 --> 24:38.083
<i> But another famous outlaw</i>
<i> is also there...</i>

24:38.083 --> 24:40.001
<i> looking for him.</i>

24:44.250 --> 24:46.583
Thank you.

24:59.792 --> 25:02.250
Mind if I join you?

25:10.625 --> 25:13.709
You're even younger
than I expected.

25:13.709 --> 25:15.875
You got a name, friend,

25:15.875 --> 25:17.667
or just a mouth on you?

25:19.208 --> 25:20.959
I got both.

25:23.500 --> 25:25.083
How do you feel about...

25:26.542 --> 25:28.542
working for Jesse James?

25:31.083 --> 25:32.875
You're Jesse James?

25:37.625 --> 25:40.542
Your name's Jesse James?

25:40.542 --> 25:44.792
You hear that?
I'm sittin' with
Jesse James over here!

25:47.001 --> 25:48.917
Well, if he's right,
I recommend

25:48.917 --> 25:50.959
<i> you put your heads</i>
<i> back to your tables.</i>

25:57.709 --> 26:00.208
I got a proposition for you.

26:11.208 --> 26:13.041
I'm puttin'
something together.

26:14.667 --> 26:18.166
The way you draw
that pistol,

26:18.166 --> 26:20.125
I could use a man
like you.

26:21.542 --> 26:23.625
For what?

26:23.625 --> 26:26.542
I'm about to make
some real money, Billy.

26:26.542 --> 26:29.208
<i> I'm not talking</i>
<i> about the silly little</i>
<i> pony game you play,</i>

26:29.208 --> 26:31.333
<i> picking off</i>
<i> a few head of cattle.</i>

26:33.208 --> 26:35.917
I'm talkin' about
train money.

26:35.917 --> 26:37.125
You think about it.

26:39.041 --> 26:41.208
Jesse James
and Billy the Kid.

26:42.959 --> 26:44.875
Got a ring to it,
doesn't it?

26:47.208 --> 26:49.041
Gardner:
<i> The legend says that</i>
<i> Jesse was trying to recruit</i>

26:49.041 --> 26:50.166
<i> Billy the Kid.</i>

26:51.917 --> 26:55.834
But Jesse is this hardened,
hardened professional

26:55.834 --> 26:57.834
who's had many years'
experience.

26:57.834 --> 27:02.083
<i> Billy the Kid, well, he's</i>
<i> just kind of a cattle rustler.</i>

27:02.083 --> 27:05.583
He didn't rob stagecoaches
or banks or trains.

27:05.583 --> 27:09.834
<i> But they both were</i>
<i> at the height of their infamy.</i>

27:11.166 --> 27:14.250
I only ride
with people I trust.

27:14.250 --> 27:18.750
And all those people...
are dead.

27:25.792 --> 27:27.709
I'm not interested.

27:36.834 --> 27:38.792
But thank you.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.375
Enjoy that whiskey.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.125
Narrator:
<i> Jesse James leaves determined</i>

27:49.125 --> 27:51.792
<i> to reignite</i>
<i> his criminal career,</i>

27:51.792 --> 27:55.709
<i> while Billy the Kid</i>
<i> continues to elude the law.</i>

28:04.166 --> 28:07.166
<i> But what Billy doesn't know</i>
<i> is that Thomas Catron</i>

28:07.166 --> 28:09.792
<i> is determined</i>
<i> to track him down.</i>

28:11.375 --> 28:14.250
<i> And with big business</i>
<i> pushing further west,</i>

28:14.250 --> 28:17.375
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> has become a liability.</i>

28:19.834 --> 28:21.959
Robert Redford:
<i> Well, I think things</i>
<i> changed drastically</i>

28:21.959 --> 28:24.125
<i> in terms of outlaws</i>

28:24.125 --> 28:26.208
<i> when business developed,</i>

28:26.208 --> 28:28.083
like the railroad
and like banks.

28:28.083 --> 28:30.333
In order for those things
to succeed,

28:30.333 --> 28:32.333
you needed law and order
to protect it.

28:38.208 --> 28:40.834
How much time
do you think
you'll need?

28:42.750 --> 28:44.375
About a month.

28:45.709 --> 28:47.959
Maybe less.

28:47.959 --> 28:49.667
But I'm gonna need men,

28:49.667 --> 28:51.417
and those men
are gonna need money.

28:52.667 --> 28:54.750
Money isn't a problem...

28:54.750 --> 28:56.333
time is.

28:59.125 --> 29:01.917
Whatever it takes,
get it done.

29:04.792 --> 29:06.792
Yes, sir.

29:08.959 --> 29:12.291
Narrator:
<i> Catron decides to</i>
<i> throw his political weight</i>

29:12.291 --> 29:14.333
<i> behind the election</i>
<i> of a new sheriff,</i>

29:14.333 --> 29:17.417
<i> a man whose</i>
<i> main responsibility</i>

29:17.417 --> 29:22.000
<i> will be the capture</i>
<i> of Billy the Kid.</i>

29:22.000 --> 29:25.959
<i> His name is Pat Garrett.</i>

29:25.959 --> 29:28.083
Gardner:
<i> There's something</i>
<i> in his character</i>

29:28.083 --> 29:30.166
<i> that people see.</i>

29:30.166 --> 29:32.250
There's some
integrity there.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.709
There's some fortitude.

29:36.001 --> 29:37.417
Narrator:
<i> A former buffalo hunter</i>

29:37.417 --> 29:39.417
<i> with a sharpshooter's eye,</i>

29:39.417 --> 29:43.291
<i> Garrett's known for</i>
<i> his skills as a tracker.</i>

29:43.291 --> 29:45.959
Gardner:
<i> Pat Garrett was</i>
<i> a good choice.</i>

29:45.959 --> 29:48.041
<i> He knew many</i>
<i> of the same people</i>

29:48.041 --> 29:50.000
<i> that Billy the Kid knew,</i>

29:50.000 --> 29:52.333
<i> and he also knew the area.</i>

29:52.333 --> 29:56.083
He knew the places
that an outlaw might hide

29:56.083 --> 29:57.458
or where they might go.

29:59.709 --> 30:02.041
<i> He would be able</i>
<i> to track them better</i>

30:02.041 --> 30:04.375
<i> than somebody that came in</i>
<i> from the outside.</i>

30:04.375 --> 30:05.917
Narrator:
<i> Pat Garrett is facing</i>

30:05.917 --> 30:07.959
<i> the greatest challenge</i>
<i> of his life,</i>

30:07.959 --> 30:10.375
<i> but he knows he's the man</i>
<i> who can take down</i>

30:10.375 --> 30:13.458
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> once and for all.</i>

30:24.125 --> 30:27.458
Narrator:
<i> In Dodge City, Kansas,</i>

30:27.458 --> 30:32.458
<i> lawman Wyatt Earp is fed up</i>
<i> with rampant corruption...</i>

30:32.458 --> 30:34.750
<i> and ready to move on.</i>

30:37.001 --> 30:38.917
Kirschner:
<i> Dodge City, after a while,</i>

30:38.917 --> 30:41.333
according to Wyatt, anyway,
lost its "snap."

30:41.333 --> 30:44.500
And he was hungry
for a new adventure.

30:50.333 --> 30:52.083
Thank you.

31:06.000 --> 31:07.834
Narrator:
<i> When he hears from</i>
<i> his brother Virgil</i>

31:07.834 --> 31:11.083
<i> about silver strikes</i>
<i> in a nearby territory,</i>

31:11.083 --> 31:13.291
<i> he knows it's time</i>
<i> for a change.</i>

31:18.792 --> 31:20.500
<i> Wyatt turns in his badge...</i>

31:22.291 --> 31:24.500
<i> and heads west.</i>

31:35.083 --> 31:38.291
Tom Selleck:
<i> I think part of the appeal</i>
<i> for us of the West</i>

31:38.291 --> 31:41.417
<i> is that this was a place</i>
<i> of limitless opportunity.</i>

31:41.417 --> 31:44.917
And if you were
willing to accept the idea
that risk is the price

31:44.917 --> 31:47.458
and you were going to pay
for that opportunity,

31:47.458 --> 31:49.959
<i> you picked up stakes,</i>
<i> took that risk,</i>

31:49.959 --> 31:52.792
<i> and, in many cases,</i>
<i> changed your life.</i>

31:52.834 --> 31:54.375
<i> It's very American</i>
<i> in spirit.</i>

31:57.834 --> 31:59.875
Narrator:
<i> Wyatt joins thousands</i>
<i> of Americans</i>

31:59.875 --> 32:02.417
<i> pushing deeper</i>
<i> into the frontier,</i>

32:02.417 --> 32:06.208
<i> hoping to cash in</i>
<i> on a new age in America.</i>

32:10.166 --> 32:12.542
H.W. Brands:
<i> By the 1870s,</i>
<i> the United States</i>

32:12.583 --> 32:16.458
is fully into
the Industrial Revolution.

32:16.458 --> 32:19.542
<i> It was a confluence</i>
<i> of changing technology,</i>

32:19.542 --> 32:21.917
<i> so there was a sense</i>
<i> in which</i>

32:21.917 --> 32:25.500
<i> the American experience</i>
<i> was gonna change.</i>

32:25.500 --> 32:29.583
Narrator:
<i> Back East, big cities</i>
<i> are growing like never before,</i>

32:29.583 --> 32:34.500
<i> built by steel and powered</i>
<i> by electricity and kerosene.</i>

32:34.500 --> 32:38.000
<i> And as the country modernizes,</i>
<i> it relies on materials</i>

32:38.000 --> 32:40.500
<i> that can only be found</i>
<i> in the West.</i>

32:46.959 --> 32:49.959
Andrew Isenberg:
<i> The United States</i>
<i> is a rapidly urbanizing</i>

32:49.959 --> 32:52.542
<i> and rapidly industrializing</i>
<i> country.</i>

32:52.583 --> 32:57.041
The gold, silver, copper,
timber, cattle--

32:57.041 --> 32:59.166
a lot of the resources
in the West

32:59.166 --> 33:03.333
are being drawn into
this industrializing nation.

33:07.041 --> 33:09.625
Narrator:
<i> In the Southwest,</i>
<i> massive silver strikes</i>

33:09.625 --> 33:12.667
<i> have given rise to</i>
<i> a new wave of boomtowns.</i>

33:15.166 --> 33:17.001
<i> And Wyatt Earp</i>
<i> is heading to the one</i>

33:17.001 --> 33:19.500
<i> that will be forever linked</i>
<i> to his legacy...</i>

33:22.583 --> 33:25.166
<i> Tombstone, Arizona.</i>

33:27.417 --> 33:30.583
<i> Twelve hundred miles away</i>
<i> in Missouri,</i>

<i> after failing to recruit</i>
<i> Billy the Kid in Las Vegas,</i>

<i> Jesse James</i>
<i> has finally managed</i>

33:36.291 --> 33:40.041
<i> to pull together</i>
<i> a new gang.</i>

33:40.041 --> 33:44.041
<i> And he's ready to make</i>
<i> his first big score in years.</i>

33:44.041 --> 33:47.125
Let's go over this
one more time.

33:47.125 --> 33:49.625
Train's gonna come
around this curve,
slow down.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.291
That's gonna give us
the time we need.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.542
And I'm gonna come out
two days early.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.792
When you boys come in,
I want you to come in
through the north.

33:56.792 --> 33:59.458
Do not go through the town.

33:59.458 --> 34:01.125
<i> Am I clear?</i>

34:01.583 --> 34:03.709
Once we board the train,

34:03.709 --> 34:07.166
I'm gonna go
to the express car,
you boys spread out.

34:07.166 --> 34:11.041
Anybody gives you trouble,
you take care of it quick.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.625
What do you mean,
"take care of 'em"?

34:16.250 --> 34:17.750
What the hell
you think I mean?

34:20.583 --> 34:22.417
Get outta here.

34:27.792 --> 34:29.792
Come on up here.

34:29.792 --> 34:32.667
I'm gonna put you
in the lead, okay?

34:32.667 --> 34:35.083
All right,
one more time.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.291
At this point,
he's just finding somebody

34:37.291 --> 34:39.417
that can hold a gun
and hold a horse

34:39.417 --> 34:42.125
<i> and that, hopefully,</i>
<i> is trustworthy.</i>

34:52.834 --> 34:54.792
<i> ( train whistle blowing )</i>

34:59.583 --> 35:01.667
( screeching )

35:07.542 --> 35:09.500
( low chattering )

35:11.583 --> 35:13.291
- ( gunshot )
- ( woman screams )

35:13.291 --> 35:15.667
Stay in your seats,
do not move.

35:15.667 --> 35:18.250
Yes, this train
is bein' robbed.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.667
And I'm not in the mood
to kill anybody today.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.375
Where the hell
you goin'?

35:32.709 --> 35:35.125
You open that safe.
Come on.

35:35.125 --> 35:36.667
Open the damn safe!

35:39.667 --> 35:41.208
( gun clicks )

35:41.208 --> 35:42.667
You hear that sound?

35:42.667 --> 35:44.417
You know what comes next?

35:45.792 --> 35:47.750
You open that safe.

35:57.166 --> 35:58.792
Jesse.

36:00.166 --> 36:02.333
What are these?

36:02.333 --> 36:03.875
Checks.

36:03.875 --> 36:07.500
Checks.
Where's the money,
where's the cash?

36:07.500 --> 36:09.792
This is it.

36:16.291 --> 36:17.625
You got checks in here?

36:17.625 --> 36:20.333
You got checks
in here?!

36:20.333 --> 36:22.458
Where's the cash?!

36:22.458 --> 36:24.583
<i> We don't carry much cash</i>
<i> anymore, just checks.</i>

36:27.250 --> 36:28.834
- ( gunshot )
-<i> ( woman screams )</i>

36:28.834 --> 36:31.250
I want everybody's attention
and I want it now!

36:32.333 --> 36:34.709
I am no longer
in a good mood!

36:34.709 --> 36:36.834
I want watches,
I want rings,

36:36.834 --> 36:39.166
I want jewelry,
wallets!

36:40.667 --> 36:43.750
You have something of value,
I want it now!

36:46.750 --> 36:48.500
C'mon now!

36:51.542 --> 36:53.709
Narrator:
<i> Without any cash,</i>
<i> Jesse's gang</i>

36:53.709 --> 36:56.333
<i> is only able to gather</i>
<i> a fraction of what he made</i>

36:56.333 --> 36:58.500
<i> on train robberies</i>
<i> years ago.</i>

37:01.333 --> 37:04.166
What you hidin' from me?

37:04.166 --> 37:07.583
Narrator:
<i> Jesse's comeback heist</i>
<i> is a complete failure.</i>

37:07.583 --> 37:10.250
<i>And now that the rail companies</i>
<i> know he's back,</i>

37:10.291 --> 37:12.792
<i> he's once again</i>
<i> one of the most wanted men</i>

37:12.792 --> 37:14.834
<i> in the West.</i>

37:22.834 --> 37:25.875
Narrator:
<i> Pat Garrett is the new sheriff</i>
<i> of Lincoln County,</i>

37:25.875 --> 37:30.834
<i>and his first order of business</i>
<i> is finding Billy the Kid.</i>

37:31.917 --> 37:34.667
<i> Garrett tracks Billy</i>
<i> relentlessly,</i>

37:34.667 --> 37:39.792
<i> covering hundreds of miles</i>
<i> in the New Mexico territory.</i>

37:39.792 --> 37:41.542
Gardner:
<i> There are so many places</i>
<i> to hide out</i>

37:41.542 --> 37:43.500
<i> in this open,</i>
<i> butte-covered country</i>

37:43.500 --> 37:46.250
<i> in New Mexico.</i>

37:46.250 --> 37:49.250
It's kind of like a needle
in a haystack.

37:49.291 --> 37:51.792
<i> So you need someone</i>
<i> who knows the territory,</i>

37:51.792 --> 37:54.458
<i> knows the country.</i>

37:56.625 --> 37:58.667
Narrator:
<i> Finally, after six weeks...</i>

37:59.917 --> 38:02.291
<i> Garrett gets a lead.</i>

38:02.333 --> 38:04.333
<i> Billy and his gang</i>
<i> have been spotted</i>

38:04.333 --> 38:08.625
<i> heading to a hideout</i>
<i> 100 miles outside Lincoln.</i>

38:35.875 --> 38:38.834
Sutherland:
<i> Pat Garrett was a tracker</i>
<i> and a hunter,</i>

38:38.834 --> 38:42.250
and when he was told
to go get Billy the Kid,
he did it.

38:46.041 --> 38:50.875
- Congratulations.
- I gotta take a piss.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.917
( gun clicks )

39:05.917 --> 39:07.417
( gunshot )

39:12.875 --> 39:14.291
Billy:
<i> Who's there?!</i>

39:14.333 --> 39:15.667
It's Pat Garrett!

39:24.001 --> 39:25.959
<i> You're not</i>
<i> gettin' away</i>
<i> this time!</i>

39:45.917 --> 39:49.500
He's gonna try to get
that lead horse.
Shoot it free.

39:54.542 --> 39:55.875
( gunshot )

39:58.375 --> 39:59.500
( gunshot )

40:00.834 --> 40:03.500
Come on, man,
can't you hit
a rope?

40:06.709 --> 40:08.417
( horse whinnies )

40:17.041 --> 40:19.709
All right...

40:19.709 --> 40:22.667
all we have to do now
is wait, boys.

40:26.583 --> 40:30.000
Narrator:
<i> With the hideout</i>
<i> completely isolated,</i>

40:30.000 --> 40:32.625
<i> Pat Garrett knows</i>
<i> that Billy's supplies</i>

40:32.625 --> 40:34.458
<i> will eventually run out.</i>

40:50.041 --> 40:52.542
Gardner:
<i> I always think Billy</i>
<i> thought there was a chance.</i>

40:52.583 --> 40:54.001
He'd already done it before

40:54.001 --> 40:55.375
and, you know,
wasn't even scratched,

40:55.375 --> 40:57.959
so maybe we can do it again.

40:57.959 --> 41:00.500
<i> But the fellow gang members</i>
<i> are starting to get weak</i>

41:00.500 --> 41:03.542
<i> and they're starting to say,</i>
<i> "I think we should surrender."</i>

41:15.750 --> 41:18.834
( horse whinnies )

41:24.041 --> 41:27.542
Drop your weapon!

41:48.667 --> 41:51.792
Chamberlain:
<i> Billy was surrounded.</i>
<i> He was running out of water,</i>

41:51.792 --> 41:54.000
<i> he had very little food,</i>

41:54.000 --> 41:57.542
and he really only
had one choice

41:57.542 --> 41:59.875
and that was to
put his hands up and come out.

42:02.542 --> 42:05.083
Narrator:
<i> On December 23rd, 1880,</i>

42:05.083 --> 42:07.875
<i> Billy the Kid surrenders.</i>

42:19.792 --> 42:24.041
<i> But while he may have</i>
<i> turned himself in...</i>

42:24.041 --> 42:27.083
<i> Billy the Kid</i>
<i> is not about to give up.</i>
