WEBVTT

00:04.000 --> 00:04.709
Okay, Dad.

00:04.792 --> 00:07.250
So, you know how I always want to go
to Super Adventure Land

00:07.375 --> 00:08.709
but you tell me it's too expensive

00:08.792 --> 00:12.000
even though it's totally worth it
'cause it's the funnest place on earth?

00:12.417 --> 00:13.667
Yes.

00:15.250 --> 00:18.041
Well, problem solved.

00:19.792 --> 00:22.458
"This coupon,
good for five dollars off admission price

00:22.542 --> 00:24.125
to Super Adventure Land

00:24.208 --> 00:28.750
upon $100 purchase at Jensen's groceries,

00:28.834 --> 00:31.083
not valid Tuesday through Sunday,

00:31.166 --> 00:33.208
closed Monday."

00:34.750 --> 00:35.750
Nice try.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.542
But, Dad!

00:37.625 --> 00:40.041
They have this new ride called
the Storm Twizzler.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.250
Nine out of ten people barf on it.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.750
They even take your photo.

00:47.875 --> 00:49.500
Gabe, I'll take you
to Super Adventure Land

00:49.583 --> 00:51.083
just as soon as I win the lottery.

00:51.583 --> 00:53.125
Oh! Hey, speaking of which,

00:53.208 --> 00:54.500
maybe today is your lucky day.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.542
Could be. Let's take a look.

00:58.041 --> 00:59.709
Hey, there's a seven, right?

00:59.792 --> 01:01.208
- Yeah.
- That's pretty good.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.000
Hey, look at this! We got another seven.
That's not too bad.

01:04.083 --> 01:05.750
One more seven. We got--

01:05.834 --> 01:07.500
Oh, look at-- Oh, look at--

- Hey, Mom.
- Debbie: Ah!

02:08.750 --> 02:11.083
- Oh!
- Hey, honey! Come meet our new neighbor.

02:11.166 --> 02:12.709
This is my daughter Teddy.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.458
Debbie Dooley. How're you doing?

02:15.250 --> 02:17.250
I'm doing dandy, Debbie Dooley.

02:18.250 --> 02:20.375
Debbie and her husband Doug
just moved here from Iowa.

02:20.458 --> 02:22.125
Doug's our new deputy police chief.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.667
And they have a daughter Charlie's age.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.166
- Deedee Dooley.
- Teddy: Oh.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.959
Debbie needed a babysitter for tomorrow

02:28.041 --> 02:29.709
and I was just telling her
how terrific you are.

02:29.792 --> 02:32.792
Oh! Yeah, no, actually my friend Ivy and I
were gonna take Charlie

02:32.875 --> 02:35.667
to Make a Monkey tomorrow
and we'd be happy to bring Deedee along.

02:35.750 --> 02:37.458
What's Make a Monkey?

02:37.542 --> 02:40.083
Oh, it's kind of complicated.
It's this place where you--

02:40.166 --> 02:41.208
you make...

02:42.625 --> 02:44.000
a monkey. I...

02:45.625 --> 02:47.667
I guess it's not that complicated.

02:50.333 --> 02:51.750
Oh, I meant to ask...

02:52.166 --> 02:53.542
Where is your dog?

02:53.959 --> 02:55.375
Um, we don't have a dog.

02:55.458 --> 02:59.542
But that nice Mrs. Dabney next door
told me to beware of Gabe.

03:03.542 --> 03:04.667
Gabe is my son.

03:06.375 --> 03:08.500
But she said he bit her.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.291
And went to the bathroom on her lawn.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.083
They have a very unique relationship.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.709
Welcome to the neighborhood!

03:24.834 --> 03:26.667
Ah... Oh, I think this one goes...

03:27.959 --> 03:30.375
- No.
- Oh, doesn't this one go...

03:32.333 --> 03:33.333
No.

03:34.875 --> 03:36.709
Eh, forget it.
Charlie can help us with it later.

03:40.709 --> 03:42.667
Oh, my dad's outside. I gotta go.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.709
- He doesn't like to be kept waiting.
- All right.

03:44.792 --> 03:45.792
- See ya.
- Skylar: See ya.

03:50.458 --> 03:53.333
No wonder we couldn't do it.
It's for ages one to three.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.375
You PJ?

04:03.458 --> 04:05.959
Uh, y-yeah yeah. That's me.

04:11.750 --> 04:12.750
So...

04:13.333 --> 04:14.792
You start going out with a girl

04:14.875 --> 04:16.875
and you don't think it's important
to meet the father?

04:17.500 --> 04:19.667
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.792
Makes me wonder what's going on
inside your head.

04:25.208 --> 04:26.417
Trust me, sir,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.166
there's nothing going on in here at all.

04:29.959 --> 04:31.583
I'm gonna be watching you

04:32.542 --> 04:34.291
to make sure you treat Skyler right,

04:34.375 --> 04:35.750
that you're worthy of her.

04:36.375 --> 04:37.417
One more thing.

04:38.333 --> 04:40.417
I don't want her to know
I've been checking up on you.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.792
Well, what does she think
you're doing right now?

04:42.875 --> 04:44.542
Using the bathroom.

04:49.667 --> 04:50.667
Is there anything else?

04:51.208 --> 04:53.458
Usually it takes me a while
to use the bathroom.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.875
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

05:06.583 --> 05:08.709
Oh, Dad, I think you dropped something.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.667
Oh, hey, one of my scratchers.

05:15.291 --> 05:17.542
Oh, hey, let's see. Maybe we've won.

05:22.083 --> 05:23.250
Seven.

05:24.542 --> 05:25.834
Another seven.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.750
Been here before. And the last number.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.333
What?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.417
Look, it's a seven!

05:39.500 --> 05:41.458
It's a seven! I won! I won!

05:41.542 --> 05:42.583
How much did you win?

05:42.667 --> 05:44.583
One million dollars!

05:44.667 --> 05:46.083
Woo-hoo!

05:46.166 --> 05:50.000
Whoo! Whoo! I won, I won, I won!

05:51.417 --> 05:52.959
What is going on with Dad?

05:53.041 --> 05:54.792
He thinks he won the lottery.

05:54.875 --> 05:55.875
Thinks?

05:55.959 --> 05:57.125
Yeah, it's a prank.

05:57.208 --> 06:00.041
I bought one of those fake scratchers
from the joke store.

06:00.125 --> 06:01.875
He fell for that?

06:01.959 --> 06:05.041
Bob: Woo-hoo! I'm king of the world!

06:06.375 --> 06:07.542
He's gonna find out.

06:07.625 --> 06:10.125
Yeah, and I'll be grounded for two weeks.

06:10.208 --> 06:13.000
But, you know,
I'll have been to Super Adventure Land.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.000
It's worth it. I crunched the numbers.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.875
I'm so happy,
I don't know what to do with myself.

06:20.959 --> 06:24.208
Well, yesterday you said
if you ever win the lottery,

06:24.250 --> 06:25.917
you'd take me to Super Adventure Land.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.875
All right, let's go! Get in the car.

06:28.959 --> 06:31.083
Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
We're millionaires.

06:31.166 --> 06:32.875
Forget the car. We're renting a limo!

06:33.750 --> 06:34.750
Wait, Dad.

06:36.166 --> 06:37.041
Okay.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.875
Oh, thank you, Dr. Charlie.

06:46.959 --> 06:48.291
I'm all better now!

06:49.875 --> 06:51.250
Ow. Another shot.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.792
No, I've already had seven shots.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.250
There's no more owies.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.041
Ow. Another shot.

06:58.125 --> 07:00.166
Okay, I think I'm kind of over this.

07:00.917 --> 07:02.500
Ivy, are you ready to go?

07:05.208 --> 07:07.166
Check out what I found in the bathroom.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.542
Diamond earrings.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.208
Watch me work it.

07:12.709 --> 07:14.917
What? Ivy! Hey, take those off.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.417
Don't you know that Deedee's Daddy's
Deputy Doug Dooley?

07:18.375 --> 07:22.250
Ivy Wentz rocking earrings
from the Dooley Collection.

07:23.583 --> 07:25.083
Seriously, take those off.

07:25.500 --> 07:27.959
Yeah, they'll look better on you anyway.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.750
No, we're here to babysit, not try on--

07:30.834 --> 07:32.000
- Ooh.
- Yeah.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.375
Oh, these do look good.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.375
Yep, strut your stuff, girl. It's fun.

07:37.500 --> 07:38.583
- Go ahead, do it.
- Okay.

07:43.291 --> 07:45.667
Ooh, ooh, ooh!

07:45.750 --> 07:48.041
Ow! Hey, who did that?

07:53.041 --> 07:54.709
- Ooh. Uh-oh.
- What?

07:54.792 --> 07:56.667
One of the doctors spilled a juice box.

07:57.333 --> 07:58.917
At least I hope it's juice.

07:59.667 --> 08:01.500
All right,
Ivy, why don't you take them outside?

08:01.583 --> 08:04.250
I'm gonna clean this up
and then we can go to Make a Monkey.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.000
Ivy: Okay. Come on.

08:06.083 --> 08:08.291
Come on, Deedee. Let's go bye-bye.

08:08.375 --> 08:09.208
Teddy: Go with Ivy.

08:09.291 --> 08:11.959
- Let's go to Make a Monkey.
- Teddy: Yay!

08:13.375 --> 08:15.083
And it's not juice.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.458
- Where are you going?
- Whoa!

08:28.083 --> 08:29.083
What are you doing here?

08:29.166 --> 08:31.208
I told you I was gonna be watching you.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.166
- Did you think I was a liar?
- No,

08:34.250 --> 08:36.667
I just-- I thought you'd be watching me
from a distance.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.583
You know, with, like,
a telescope or binoculars or something.

08:39.667 --> 08:42.208
I did that for a while. I got bored.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.542
Now I asked you a question.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.375
Where are you going?

08:48.458 --> 08:51.875
I'm going to the library to meet Skyler.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.834
Looking like that?
You couldn't even comb your hair?

08:54.917 --> 08:57.291
I spent 20 minutes to get it like this.

09:00.667 --> 09:01.667
What are you doing?

09:01.750 --> 09:04.291
Anytime you do something I do not like,

09:04.375 --> 09:06.166
I mark it down in the negative column.

09:07.125 --> 09:08.667
Is there a positive column too?

09:08.750 --> 09:09.875
Not yet.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.125
Okay.

09:13.208 --> 09:15.083
Well, if you'll excuse me,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.458
I'm gonna go back inside and comb my hair,

09:17.542 --> 09:19.625
but not because of anything you said,

09:19.709 --> 09:20.750
because I want to.

09:25.875 --> 09:26.917
Stupid, stupid.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.083
"Bad with doors."

09:37.166 --> 09:39.625
That was four hours of my life
I'll never get back.

09:41.333 --> 09:44.166
I still have that theme song drilled
into my head.

09:44.208 --> 09:47.208
♪ First you pick a color
Brown or green or red ♪

09:47.291 --> 09:50.250
♪ Then you take some stuffing
And put it in its head ♪

09:50.333 --> 09:53.583
♪ Then it goes on for 20 more verses
And you wish you were dead ♪

09:53.667 --> 09:59.083
♪ And that's how you make
A mo-oh-oh-oh-nkey ♪

10:03.000 --> 10:04.500
- Oh, no!
- What?

10:04.583 --> 10:06.417
The earrings. You're still wearing them.

10:06.500 --> 10:07.583
- What?
- Yes.

10:08.458 --> 10:12.834
Oh! Ivy, Ivy, I just have one earring on.
The other one must have fallen off.

10:12.917 --> 10:15.250
- No.
- Yes! Yes.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.041
I lost her diamond earring.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.375
What? Why did you even try them on?

10:19.458 --> 10:21.875
- What? That was your idea!
- You know better than to listen to me.

10:21.959 --> 10:24.834
Okay, okay, okay.
All right, let's not panic.

10:24.917 --> 10:27.542
I'll just, um... Okay, I'll check the car.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.625
You-- you call Make a Monkey
and see if they found it.

10:30.709 --> 10:33.125
The important thing here is...

10:33.208 --> 10:34.333
is not to panic.

10:39.792 --> 10:41.250
- Not in the car.
- Not at the place.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.041
Okay, time to panic.

10:44.125 --> 10:45.834
Calm down. Ivy's got a plan.

10:45.917 --> 10:48.000
Oh, Ivy's got a plan.

10:48.959 --> 10:50.750
Look, I think I know where the earring is.

10:50.834 --> 10:51.750
Where?

10:51.834 --> 10:52.792
- Check it out.
- Okay.

10:52.875 --> 10:54.917
I took some pictures at Make A Monkey.

10:55.000 --> 10:57.208
Here you are at the stuffing machine--
two earrings.

10:57.291 --> 11:01.291
Oh! Oh, here I am
after the stuffing machine-- one earring.

11:01.375 --> 11:04.709
Yes! So the missing earring is...

11:05.583 --> 11:07.625
both: Inside a monkey!

11:11.375 --> 11:13.834
Hi, Charlie. What you got there?

11:13.917 --> 11:15.000
Monkey.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.375
Can I see it?

11:21.208 --> 11:22.500
- Get that monkey!
- Mm-hmm.

11:30.667 --> 11:32.834
Man, that sister of yours

11:33.208 --> 11:34.583
can put up quite a fight.

11:35.375 --> 11:36.333
I know.

11:36.834 --> 11:39.875
Oh, we'd be better off
if we fought an actual monkey.

11:40.583 --> 11:42.000
She sure does love that thing.

11:43.041 --> 11:45.000
Yeah. Yeah, she sure does.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.625
Now let's rip it apart.

11:50.375 --> 11:52.250
It's not in here.

11:53.375 --> 11:57.250
- Oh, this is bad. This is really bad.
- T, calm down!

11:57.333 --> 11:59.667
If the earring isn't in this monkey,

11:59.750 --> 12:02.625
it has to be in the other monkey.

12:02.709 --> 12:06.000
Right! Right, right, right,
Deedee's monkey

12:06.083 --> 12:08.250
that's in the police chief's house.

12:08.834 --> 12:10.166
Is that calm enough for you?

12:18.542 --> 12:21.959
- Man, Super Adventure Land was amazing.
- It sure is. Hey, hey, hey!

12:22.041 --> 12:23.709
Give me the picture of the log ride again.

12:23.792 --> 12:25.959
Ah, look at your face!

12:26.041 --> 12:27.166
Look at your face!

12:27.250 --> 12:29.500
Look at the limo driver's face.

12:32.917 --> 12:34.542
Oh, okay, Dad.

12:34.625 --> 12:35.667
Now that we've had our fun,

12:35.750 --> 12:37.375
there's something I gotta tell you.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.875
Maybe you should sit down.

12:41.834 --> 12:45.041
Hey, kids, how do you like
mama's new ride?

12:45.125 --> 12:46.583
Hey, look at you.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.041
Where did you get that?

12:50.125 --> 12:50.959
At the mall.

12:51.041 --> 12:54.458
Yeah, I did a little shopping
after your dad told me we won the lottery.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.166
You can return that, right?

12:56.250 --> 12:58.959
Nope, forever rich has a no-return policy.

12:59.041 --> 13:00.375
But who cares?

13:00.875 --> 13:03.417
Not me! Nothing bothers a millionaire!

13:03.500 --> 13:05.458
Nothing bothers a millionaire!

13:05.542 --> 13:07.500
- Woo-hoo!
- Whoo!

13:09.291 --> 13:11.667
You guys didn't really win the lottery.

13:12.208 --> 13:15.125
It was just a prank
so I could go to Super Adventure Land.

13:18.208 --> 13:19.583
That's really funny.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.917
So why aren't you laughing?

13:24.000 --> 13:27.250
I'm really sorry.
I never meant for it to go this far.

13:30.333 --> 13:32.333
Now, I know you're probably
gonna ground me

13:32.417 --> 13:33.667
for, like, two weeks,

13:33.792 --> 13:35.834
but under the circumstances,

13:35.917 --> 13:38.041
I'm fine with three.

13:39.375 --> 13:41.291
I quit my job today.

13:42.792 --> 13:43.959
What?

13:44.709 --> 13:46.375
You can get it back, right?

13:47.125 --> 13:48.083
Uh...

13:48.458 --> 13:51.750
What? What? We won? I can't believe it!

13:51.834 --> 13:53.834
I'll tell you
what I can't believe, Duncan,

13:53.959 --> 13:56.500
and it's that you're taking
another personal call.

13:56.583 --> 13:59.625
Now I asked you to do something
with these bags of saline

13:59.709 --> 14:00.875
a half an hour ago.

14:03.166 --> 14:05.834
Uh, gotta go.

14:05.959 --> 14:07.542
You know what, Karen?
You're absolutely right.

14:08.208 --> 14:10.375
I should have done something
with these saline bags

14:10.458 --> 14:12.166
a long time ago.

14:12.250 --> 14:14.166
I mean, this is really overdue.

14:14.250 --> 14:18.291
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

14:18.375 --> 14:19.667
Amy: Yeah!

14:22.917 --> 14:24.041
Hi.

14:24.709 --> 14:25.834
Take me to easy street.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.333
So long, suckers!

14:31.041 --> 14:32.208
How could you do that?

14:32.291 --> 14:34.125
Because I was a millionaire!

14:34.208 --> 14:36.000
Rich people play by different rules!

14:37.375 --> 14:38.750
I'm so sorry.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.125
Dad, are you okay?

14:42.583 --> 14:44.250
He's hugging the kettle corn.

14:45.542 --> 14:47.500
This is all I have left.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.792
Oh, the old orange peel smile
always cracks me up.

15:05.875 --> 15:08.417
I tried it once with a pineapple--
not as fun.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.166
I gotta go rinse.

15:11.250 --> 15:13.166
I can't stand the feel
of pulp on my teeth.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.250
I love learning new things about you.

15:37.166 --> 15:39.083
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's great.

15:40.417 --> 15:41.583
- Really?
- Really, yeah.

15:41.667 --> 15:42.750
Everything couldn't be better.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.709
You're acting kind of weird.

15:45.792 --> 15:48.500
No, I'm not acting weird. No.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.917
If anything, I'm acting not weird.

15:53.083 --> 15:54.709
Why does this always happen?

15:54.792 --> 15:55.625
What?

15:55.709 --> 15:57.041
I date a guy for a while

15:57.125 --> 15:59.667
and then, all of a sudden,
he starts acting all strange.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.083
Then what happens?

16:01.166 --> 16:02.375
Then he just kind of...

16:03.000 --> 16:04.333
disappears.

16:14.750 --> 16:15.959
Hey, Mom. What are you doing?

16:16.041 --> 16:17.792
Hey. A couple things.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.166
Trying to find a new job

16:19.250 --> 16:22.834
and researching military schools for Gabe.

16:22.959 --> 16:24.792
Wow, that sounds stressful.

16:24.875 --> 16:27.333
Hey, you know, you should go to the gym.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.208
Maybe-- maybe with a workout buddy.

16:29.291 --> 16:31.750
Somebody like Debbie Dooley. She's fun.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.458
Teddy, I know what you're trying to do.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.166
Mm-hmm, you want back
into Debbie Dooley's house,

16:38.250 --> 16:39.667
and I know why.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.083
- You do?
- Yep.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.125
You want another babysitting gig.

16:43.208 --> 16:45.959
Am I that transparent?

16:50.375 --> 16:52.125
Charlie, what happened to your monkey?

16:52.208 --> 16:53.458
I don't know.

16:54.375 --> 16:57.208
Well, $62 for this?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.917
The head's not even facing the right way.

17:01.166 --> 17:02.709
That's the way she wanted it.

17:09.959 --> 17:11.750
Excuse me, are you Karen?

17:11.834 --> 17:12.959
Yeah. Why?

17:13.041 --> 17:15.083
I'm Gabe, Amy Duncan's son.

17:20.208 --> 17:23.750
Look, the reason my mom quit
was all my fault.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.792
I played a really mean prank on my parents

17:25.875 --> 17:27.458
and it got way out of hand.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.834
Now that you know the truth,
can you please give her her job back?

17:32.125 --> 17:35.125
Well, if it means that much to you...

17:36.000 --> 17:37.000
no!

17:37.083 --> 17:38.625
Ha! Gotcha!

17:38.709 --> 17:39.959
Oh, you should see your face.

17:40.041 --> 17:42.083
I really had you going there, didn't I?

17:42.166 --> 17:43.667
Oh, good!

17:43.750 --> 17:44.959
Good for you, Karen.

17:48.250 --> 17:49.792
Okay.

17:52.542 --> 17:53.792
Excuse me.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.875
Do you know whose lottery ticket this is?

17:56.959 --> 17:57.875
Yes. It's mine.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.750
I won! I won!

18:06.834 --> 18:10.333
I won! I won! I won!

18:10.417 --> 18:12.542
Hey! Hey! Hey!

18:16.375 --> 18:18.000
I've always loved you.

18:25.125 --> 18:26.125
Hi. May I-- Oh!

18:28.500 --> 18:30.125
How much longer
are you gonna follow me around?

18:30.208 --> 18:33.000
Till I find out the kind of guy you are.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.917
Now I'm a guy
who's about to restock the cups.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.750
"Bad with cups."

18:45.834 --> 18:47.834
Look, I only messed up
'cause you made me nervous.

18:47.917 --> 18:48.917
Thanks!

18:49.583 --> 18:51.417
- Got all I need.
- For what?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.709
To tell Skyler you're not the guy.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.083
See ya.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.875
No! No. Stop!

19:00.208 --> 19:01.500
I am the guy.

19:02.166 --> 19:03.959
Skyler is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

19:04.041 --> 19:06.041
and I'm not going away no matter what.

19:06.125 --> 19:07.834
So put that in your little notebook.

19:09.625 --> 19:11.792
Oh, and number 12, your order's ready.
Number 12.

19:18.583 --> 19:19.583
Uh-oh.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.041
Is this the part
where you make me disappear?

19:23.375 --> 19:24.875
Relax, kid.

19:25.417 --> 19:28.375
You stuck up for yourself!
That's what I wanted to hear.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.959
So it's okay if I date your daughter?

19:31.041 --> 19:33.000
Oh, she's not my daughter.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.083
She's his daughter.

19:39.250 --> 19:42.250
He always hires me
to check out the boyfriends.

19:42.375 --> 19:45.375
With that elfin smile,
people don't take him too seriously.

19:50.834 --> 19:54.083
Deedee was so excited that Teddy was back.

19:54.166 --> 19:56.709
That daughter of yours is quite something.

19:56.792 --> 19:59.291
Yeah, I make some good daughters.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.333
Bob makes the boys.

20:02.792 --> 20:07.125
Yesterday, it was just so good
to watch Deedee have fun with Teddy.

20:07.208 --> 20:08.333
What do you mean watch?

20:08.417 --> 20:11.709
Oh, well, my husband insisted
we put in a nanny-cam.

20:11.792 --> 20:13.875
Oh, a nanny-cam?
I've never seen one of those.

20:13.959 --> 20:16.333
If you have a laptop,
I'll show you right now.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.959
- I do, right behind you. Let's look.
- Oh!

20:19.583 --> 20:21.458
Oh, good.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.500
Oh, there they are.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.208
Your daughter has a real gift.

20:29.250 --> 20:31.458
It takes me forever to put Deedee down.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.458
Well, that's a little peculiar.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.625
This doesn't seem right.

20:53.500 --> 20:54.792
Oh, my goodness.

20:54.875 --> 20:57.333
She's murdering the monkey!

20:58.000 --> 20:59.250
Oh.

21:00.208 --> 21:01.750
Really?

21:02.792 --> 21:04.125
One neighbor!

21:04.208 --> 21:06.709
I just want to be friends
with one neighbor.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.041
Hey, Charlie.

21:13.125 --> 21:16.458
So, um, I learned
a very important life lesson today,

21:16.542 --> 21:19.709
and that is never wear
a pair of accidentally stolen earrings

21:19.792 --> 21:21.667
to Make a Monkey because if you do,

21:21.750 --> 21:23.375
your neighbor might say something like,

21:23.458 --> 21:24.750
"Oh, my goodness,

21:24.834 --> 21:26.834
that girl's just not right in the head."

21:28.375 --> 21:29.458
Hi, Charlie.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.500
Oh, and mom's back at work.

21:31.583 --> 21:34.291
Actually her boss quit
for some unknown reason

21:34.375 --> 21:36.166
and so she got a promotion.

21:36.250 --> 21:39.041
Which is why daddy gets one of these too.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.000
Amy: Bob, watch where you're going!

21:42.583 --> 21:44.250
Oh.

21:44.375 --> 21:45.417
Yeah, in a couple of years,

21:45.500 --> 21:46.959
when all of us kids have left the house,

21:47.041 --> 21:48.333
they'll be all yours.

21:49.041 --> 21:50.125
Good luck, Charlie.

21:56.542 --> 21:58.417
Hey, what happened to you?

21:58.500 --> 22:01.417
Isn't it obvious? My head's on backwards.

22:01.500 --> 22:04.041
Yeah, I didn't want to say anything.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.959
Doctor, the patients are prepped
and ready for surgery.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.834
She look a little young to you?

22:16.917 --> 22:18.834
I'm sure she's highly trained.

22:21.709 --> 22:23.250
You can go first.
