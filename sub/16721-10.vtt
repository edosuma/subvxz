[theme music playing]

01:24.152 --> 01:25.695
[EKG machine flatlining]

01:25.779 --> 01:27.155
[Claire breathes deeply]

01:27.238 --> 01:28.907
- Do you have defib paddles?
- No.

01:28.990 --> 01:30.575
Shit!

01:30.659 --> 01:33.036
- What are you looking for?
- [panting]

01:33.828 --> 01:35.705
Claire, what the hell are you doing?

01:36.956 --> 01:37.957
Stand back!

01:42.045 --> 01:43.713
[Luke groaning]

01:46.174 --> 01:47.300
[machine powering up]

01:50.219 --> 01:52.889
- [panting]
- [EKG machine beeping]

01:54.641 --> 01:56.475
[bubbling]

01:57.644 --> 01:59.103
- That was reckless.
- Yeah.

01:59.187 --> 02:00.313
Sometimes you gotta
throw the science out

02:00.396 --> 02:01.523
and go with what you know.

02:01.606 --> 02:05.985
Okay, let's take this step by step
and think this through.

02:06.069 --> 02:07.571
Once we get the shrapnel removed,

02:07.654 --> 02:10.406
his healing factor and cell regeneration
should take care of everything else.

02:10.489 --> 02:12.992
But what's next? Temperature is right.

02:13.076 --> 02:15.579
Uh, we have to raise the pH levels
so his skin reacts.

02:15.662 --> 02:18.414
So what else will break down
abalone shell?

02:18.497 --> 02:19.498
Salt water!

02:19.583 --> 02:21.500
- Yeah. Yeah. Saline!
- Salt water.

02:21.585 --> 02:23.962
Where do you have it? Is that it?

02:25.755 --> 02:27.423
[bubbling]

02:38.309 --> 02:40.103
[grunts]

02:40.186 --> 02:43.189
Let's get him out.
He has chills. That won't help him.

02:43.272 --> 02:44.733
[Burstein] His temperature's
dropping quickly.

02:46.109 --> 02:47.276
That's it.

02:48.319 --> 02:49.738
It's not the pH mixture
that's the problem.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.364
It's the temperature.

02:51.447 --> 02:53.491
We need to turn it up. All the way up!

02:53.574 --> 02:55.284
[Burstein] No, no!
You don't know what you're doing.

02:55.368 --> 02:57.370
Did you bring him all this way
just to kill him?

02:57.453 --> 02:58.997
Think about what happened last time.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.957
The temperature was the only thing
that you couldn't control.

03:01.040 --> 03:02.041
- That's what you said.
- Yes.

03:02.125 --> 03:04.502
But Albert Rackham was a racist asshole.
He was trying to kill Carl.

03:04.585 --> 03:06.254
Okay. Well, maybe that redneck
was onto something.

03:06.337 --> 03:08.339
Maybe the explosion is what did it.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.675
We don't just need to heat up that soup.
We need to boil it!

03:10.759 --> 03:13.302
You are about to do something
completely stupid.

03:13.386 --> 03:14.888
[breathes deeply]

03:14.971 --> 03:17.390
I wouldn't be a good scientist
if I let you do it alone.

03:17.473 --> 03:19.308
- [valve opening]
- [air hissing]

03:24.230 --> 03:25.356
All right.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.525
More.

03:28.442 --> 03:30.111
All the way up.

03:31.946 --> 03:33.990
- [steam hissing]
- It's really heating up.

03:36.868 --> 03:38.577
It's climbing.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.541
[loud thud]

03:48.212 --> 03:50.006
This is good. This is very good.

03:55.887 --> 03:57.346
- [Burstein] You see?
- [Claire] Yeah.

03:57.430 --> 03:58.431
[steam hissing]

03:59.557 --> 04:00.850
I need a scalpel.

04:00.934 --> 04:03.019
- Scalpel.
- Okay.

04:05.521 --> 04:07.523
I'm seeing something.
This is really deep.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.486
[alarm blaring]

04:14.072 --> 04:15.489
Forceps.

04:15.573 --> 04:16.991
Forceps.

04:26.125 --> 04:27.168
Okay.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.630
- How many more left?
- Two more pieces.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.225
[beeping]

04:43.517 --> 04:45.519
- [Claire] I'm losing him.
- [Luke groaning]

04:45.603 --> 04:48.439
- I'm not going fast enough.
- You're doing great.

04:51.442 --> 04:53.236
- Got it.
- [shrapnel clinks]

04:58.825 --> 05:00.159
Claire.

05:01.119 --> 05:03.079
- [muffled screaming]
- You're okay.

05:04.622 --> 05:06.750
- [Luke breathing heavily]
- [Claire] Hey, got you.

05:06.833 --> 05:09.377
- We got it all.
- [breathing heavily]

05:09.460 --> 05:12.171
We got it all. You're gonna be okay.

05:12.255 --> 05:13.715
[breathing heavily] We did it.

05:13.798 --> 05:16.384
We did it. You're gonna be fine.

05:26.728 --> 05:28.021
[sighs]

05:29.230 --> 05:30.982
Who the hell are you?

05:41.826 --> 05:44.287
You took your sweet time,
Madam Councilwoman.

05:44.370 --> 05:46.539
Why didn't you just come to me?

05:46.622 --> 05:48.707
Power doesn't travel.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.209
First rule of business...

05:50.293 --> 05:51.836
and war.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.339
You have no real power without me.

05:56.340 --> 05:58.092
You could at least let Tony bring me.

05:58.176 --> 06:00.719
I got lost three times
trying to find this damn place.

06:00.804 --> 06:04.390
Sure, but then I would've had
to put a bullet in the back of his head.

06:05.349 --> 06:07.977
No one comes here. Period.

06:20.990 --> 06:22.450
[Mariah] So this is the cure?

06:22.533 --> 06:26.329
[Stryker] That's medicinal-grade,
heavy-duty RX stacked up right there.

06:26.412 --> 06:27.872
Most definitely.

06:27.956 --> 06:31.167
You wouldn't believe
how expensive these things are.

06:31.250 --> 06:35.796
Untraceable, alien metal... explosive.

06:36.714 --> 06:38.883
You hit Luke Cage with one of these.

06:38.967 --> 06:40.844
He's still alive.

06:40.927 --> 06:43.637
If it didn't work, what's the big deal?

06:43.721 --> 06:47.976
Well, you don't need to kill God
with one shot to sell a weapon.

06:48.059 --> 06:49.936
You just need to make him bleed.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.731
That's all well and good,
but who's gonna be able to afford it?

06:53.814 --> 06:56.817
What price can you put on peace of mind?

06:56.901 --> 06:58.236
Don't sweat it.

06:59.237 --> 07:03.366
The same Judas metal
can be broken down for mass production.

07:03.449 --> 07:06.327
Each single bullet is less powerful,

07:06.410 --> 07:11.207
but now you can put 'em in a machine gun
and let off a hundred of those bitches.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.710
Mass production is where it's at.

07:14.793 --> 07:17.964
I'm a politician. I'm not a gun dealer.

07:19.382 --> 07:20.383
Well...

07:21.342 --> 07:23.011
what's the difference?

07:24.553 --> 07:26.055
[blows]

07:27.140 --> 07:28.975
Sell the fear.

07:29.058 --> 07:31.602
Those people need to look
at that dashcam footage

07:31.685 --> 07:34.563
and ask themselves if the world is ready

07:34.647 --> 07:37.691
for bulletproof niggas
that eat cops for breakfast.

07:38.609 --> 07:40.361
Black fear.

07:40.444 --> 07:45.033
After abolition, it's how gun laws
got enacted in the first place.

07:46.075 --> 07:49.578
[Mariah] You talk of laws.
Laws are bureaucracy.

07:49.662 --> 07:53.041
The mayor can't even wipe his ass
without three different committees

07:53.124 --> 07:56.377
to argue about the texture of the paper
and to pick the brand.

07:57.753 --> 08:00.339
I'm gonna need time
to sell the cops on this,

08:00.423 --> 08:01.757
even with the fear.

08:01.840 --> 08:04.718
[chuckles] Ooh.
Well, you're out of time.

08:04.802 --> 08:06.429
This shit starts right now.

08:07.471 --> 08:08.890
What?

08:14.187 --> 08:17.856
I hate to interrupt
your Isotoner moment, but...

08:17.941 --> 08:19.442
this is serious.

08:20.568 --> 08:22.987
I'm out of time and then?

08:23.071 --> 08:25.489
A few illmatic deaths.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.283
Word of mouth spreads like wildfire.

08:27.366 --> 08:28.826
No!

08:28.910 --> 08:31.370
Luke Cage must be the focus.

08:31.454 --> 08:34.039
Oh, he is my focus.

08:34.957 --> 08:36.167
Always.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.800
I've never seen anything like it.

08:45.801 --> 08:47.011
- [Burstein] No one has.
- [sighs]

08:47.929 --> 08:50.889
A man whose cells can regenerate
is a man who doesn't age.

08:52.058 --> 08:53.809
Do you know how valuable that is?

08:55.186 --> 08:56.854
Luke's the only one?

08:57.896 --> 08:58.897
Yes.

08:59.815 --> 09:01.943
All the other subjects failed.

09:03.527 --> 09:05.863
[sighs] There's a lot of work to be done.

09:06.864 --> 09:08.532
A lot of good work.

09:08.616 --> 09:10.618
How many more people will have to die?

09:11.244 --> 09:14.538
They volunteered in exchange
for time off their sentences.

09:15.664 --> 09:17.166
They knew the risks.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.961
[sighs] I... I'm not a monster.

09:20.044 --> 09:21.462
I never said you were.

09:23.006 --> 09:24.340
[Luke sighs]

09:26.300 --> 09:27.593
Hey.

09:28.594 --> 09:29.928
Who are you?

09:34.350 --> 09:35.809
Just kidding, Claire.

09:36.519 --> 09:38.062
[Luke chuckling]

09:40.982 --> 09:42.483
[child] I've got you!

09:42.566 --> 09:44.068
[children playing]

09:46.945 --> 09:49.448
- Hi, Ann. How are you?
- Morning, Officer.

09:54.495 --> 09:57.790
[vendor] Hey, Officer Albini.
Got those socks your wife wanted.

09:57.873 --> 09:58.874
Pink or red?

09:59.875 --> 10:01.419
One set or more?

10:02.378 --> 10:03.671
Yeah.

10:04.588 --> 10:06.132
All right. Okay.

10:08.301 --> 10:10.178
[glove powering up]

10:10.261 --> 10:11.470
I'll be right back.

10:16.809 --> 10:17.810
Can I help you?

10:17.893 --> 10:20.396
My name is Luke Cage.

10:20.479 --> 10:22.023
[grunts]

10:29.988 --> 10:32.158
I'm Luke Cage!

10:32.241 --> 10:33.451
<i>Luke Cage!</i>

10:33.534 --> 10:35.703
[Chang] So that's what you saw?
[vendor] Yeah, that's what I saw.

10:35.786 --> 10:37.413
Exactly like that.

10:38.456 --> 10:40.124
That cat with the hoodie
punched that cop

10:40.208 --> 10:41.875
and he flew back, like, 20 feet,

10:41.959 --> 10:44.628
like he was shot from a cannon
or some shit.

10:44.712 --> 10:47.631
So, uh, this was the guy you saw?

10:47.715 --> 10:50.551
I didn't see his face.
But he laid him out.

10:50.634 --> 10:52.928
- Then he said, "Luke."
- [Chang] Cage?

10:53.011 --> 10:55.181
[vendor] Oh, I just heard "Luke."
Or maybe "Duke" or...

10:55.264 --> 10:57.266
- Hey.
- [Misty] Hey, Bailey.

10:57.350 --> 10:58.351
What do you think?

10:59.227 --> 11:02.396
[sighs] Well, let's eliminate
the other possibilities.

11:02.480 --> 11:05.399
We know Jackie wasn't hit by a car
or anything like that,

11:05.483 --> 11:06.859
and this guy over here talking to Chang

11:06.942 --> 11:08.026
isn't just making stuff up,

11:08.111 --> 11:10.863
'cause that Luke Cage
dashcam video went viral.

11:12.198 --> 11:14.283
Well, there are no impact wounds.

11:14.367 --> 11:15.993
No glass, metal flakes or nothing.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.329
The impact is localized and focused.

11:18.412 --> 11:20.456
- I mean, he was hit...
- Punched.

11:20.539 --> 11:21.665
He was punched...

11:22.583 --> 11:24.418
and he flew back over 20 feet.

11:25.336 --> 11:27.838
And the size of the hole
and the punch is consistent

11:27.921 --> 11:29.465
with that of a human fist.

11:29.548 --> 11:31.842
And the punch was so hard,
it bent back the shock plate

11:31.925 --> 11:33.177
of his Kevlar vest.

11:36.555 --> 11:37.765
Nanny said Cage?

11:37.848 --> 11:41.101
The nanny is saying
she heard the suspect say "Cage."

11:41.185 --> 11:42.978
But let's think about this.

11:43.061 --> 11:47.691
A guy in a hoodie, punching a cop
and then saying his name?

11:47.775 --> 11:50.611
If it was one of the goons
connected to Cottonmouth,

11:50.694 --> 11:53.781
I could halfway see it, but... a cop?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.699
Don't forget, you know, he's on the run.

11:56.867 --> 11:58.994
You saw him fighting with us
on that dashcam vid.

11:59.912 --> 12:02.873
Albini, he must've just spotted him
and he tried to take him down himself.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.669
Jackie was never a hard charger.
I don't see it.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.338
Who else has that kind of strength?

12:11.131 --> 12:13.634
Look, in Harlem, black,
wearing a hoodie...

12:13.717 --> 12:14.718
It's not rocket science.

12:15.219 --> 12:17.471
What about the backpack
they said he was wearing, huh?

12:17.555 --> 12:19.097
What about it? Luke doesn't wear one?

12:19.182 --> 12:20.933
Not usually, no.

12:21.892 --> 12:23.811
So he switched it up that day.
And what's the big deal?

12:23.894 --> 12:25.188
How does that eliminate him?

12:25.271 --> 12:27.815
- The whole thing just doesn't smell right.
- I don't smell anything.

12:27.898 --> 12:30.067
[indistinct arguing]

12:30.150 --> 12:32.736
Right now, I smell rage.

12:32.820 --> 12:35.656
Wait. Smith, Smith, Smith.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Smith.

12:37.157 --> 12:38.826
This is Harlem.

12:38.909 --> 12:42.288
And when a cop gets killed, heads roll.
That's just how we do.

12:42.371 --> 12:44.164
You killed a cop!

12:45.165 --> 12:46.459
I know you did it.

12:46.542 --> 12:49.044
Now kids are getting jacked up
by the police.

12:49.127 --> 12:50.921
What are you doing to my city?

12:51.004 --> 12:53.632
It's not yours. Never was.

12:53.716 --> 12:57.345
Harlem is my birthright. It's mine!

12:57.428 --> 12:58.929
City council or not.

12:59.638 --> 13:02.225
"When justice is done...

13:02.308 --> 13:04.393
it is a joy to the righteous...

13:05.311 --> 13:07.521
but terror to evildoers."

13:08.439 --> 13:11.484
You quote the Bible
like you actually believe in God.

13:11.567 --> 13:12.860
And you speak to me

13:12.943 --> 13:15.738
as if you're not actually
in the presence of death.

13:16.489 --> 13:19.032
Your way was taking too long.

13:19.116 --> 13:24.247
I killed two birds with one stone
by sticking a body on Luke Cage.

13:25.163 --> 13:28.626
He's hiding somewhere
in the blessed aquarium,

13:28.709 --> 13:30.586
so I turned the heat up.

13:32.546 --> 13:33.714
Old Carl...

13:34.673 --> 13:38.093
he's either gonna stand up
and defend his name...

13:39.094 --> 13:41.972
or he's gonna run and hide,
like a bitch.

13:43.098 --> 13:45.434
Either way, it doesn't matter.

13:45.518 --> 13:48.312
I've got the gun to take him out.

13:49.187 --> 13:51.148
You're completely out of control.

13:51.732 --> 13:56.529
And you're not a real politician,
because if you were,

13:56.612 --> 13:58.489
you'd flip this.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.075
Get your Sharpton on.

14:03.118 --> 14:06.372
Make this moment all about you.

14:07.498 --> 14:11.001
- [Smith] I know the job, Inspector.
- Watch your tone, Jake.

14:11.084 --> 14:12.586
That's not what I'm saying.

14:12.670 --> 14:14.087
People are pissed. I'm pissed.

14:14.171 --> 14:16.590
- But we can't let this get out of hand.
- Goddamn right.

14:16.674 --> 14:17.841
One of our own is dead.

14:17.925 --> 14:21.262
<i>Cage is gonna pay for what he did.</i>
<i>We're gonna hit the streets hard.</i>

14:21.345 --> 14:23.055
<i>We're gonna shake the ground.</i>
<i>Smoke him out.</i>

14:23.138 --> 14:24.765
<i>That's how you find a roach.</i>
<i>You fumigate.</i>

14:24.848 --> 14:26.850
[officer 1] Hold up!
[officer 2] Get him down.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.145
[Ridley] <i>You're talking about</i>
<i>a community of people, not pests.</i>

14:30.228 --> 14:33.023
Oh, come on, Inspector.
I'm from the South Bronx.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.608
<i>I'm 28 years on the job.</i>

14:34.692 --> 14:37.653
<i>I'm not some idiot who's afraid</i>
<i>of blacks and Hispanics.</i>

14:38.737 --> 14:41.073
I said "police." Where's Luke Cage?

14:41.156 --> 14:42.658
Who? Wisdom is locked up.

14:42.741 --> 14:44.827
He in C-74.
This is not his corner no more!

14:44.910 --> 14:48.914
Not Wiz, fool! Cage, Luke Cage.
Where is Luke Cage?

14:48.997 --> 14:51.667
- This is all about Luke Cage.
- Look, I want Cage as badly as you do.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.669
He's at the center
of three active investigations.

14:53.752 --> 14:55.504
But we need to be careful
about how we pursue this.

14:55.588 --> 14:57.881
[Smith] <i>Caution is in the wind,</i>
<i>just like he is.</i>

14:57.965 --> 15:00.384
<i>- Our guys need results.</i>
- [Ridley] <i>Remember who you serve.</i>

15:00.468 --> 15:02.135
All right, all right.

15:02.219 --> 15:04.763
- I know one kid who knows Luke Cage.
- Who?

15:04.847 --> 15:06.139
What's his name?

15:06.223 --> 15:07.600
Do not light up Harlem behind this.

15:07.683 --> 15:10.268
The good people in Harlem
have no problem with me.

15:10.353 --> 15:11.520
Just the assholes.

15:11.604 --> 15:13.188
[Ridley] You need to be responsible.

15:13.271 --> 15:15.065
- Methodical.
- [Smith] That, we are.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.485
[Ridley] Okay. Do it right.
No bullshit, no headlines.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.152
You find him, you take him down.

15:21.029 --> 15:22.239
Anything on your boy?

15:22.865 --> 15:24.325
Chang's taking the lead on that one.

15:25.743 --> 15:28.662
I don't care. Luke is your guy.

15:28.746 --> 15:31.624
Look, I'm trying to figure out
who attacked me.

15:31.707 --> 15:33.709
[Lonnie] I know where I'm goin'.
Why you gotta be so tight...

15:33.792 --> 15:36.754
Why is you holding onto me like that?
Get up off me, man.

15:36.837 --> 15:40.508
Until Luke Cage is in cuffs,
he's your priority, not your attacker.

15:40.591 --> 15:41.717
Thanks.

15:50.267 --> 15:51.435
Do you have a lotto winner yet?

15:53.061 --> 15:55.689
We have the majority of the face.

15:55.773 --> 15:59.192
Lot of angles, but not a full composite.

16:00.778 --> 16:03.155
[Bailey] I have a friend down in intel
on the task force.

16:03.238 --> 16:06.324
- Maybe she could help.
- Ooh! "She"?

16:06.409 --> 16:09.828
- I wanna talk to my mother.
- Your mother? [chuckles]

16:09.912 --> 16:12.289
You definitely ain't no hard rock.

16:12.373 --> 16:15.125
She's a lawyer. Or she about to be.

16:15.834 --> 16:20.839
Well, if you haven't done anything wrong,
you don't have any problem.

16:20.923 --> 16:22.466
I don't.

16:22.550 --> 16:25.386
But you've got about five problems,
far as I can tell.

16:25.469 --> 16:27.555
- Like what?
- [scoffs]

16:27.638 --> 16:29.515
I was on my way home from school.

16:29.598 --> 16:31.684
Y'all picked me up with no PC.

16:31.767 --> 16:34.061
I just got back from school. Chess club.

16:34.144 --> 16:36.063
Fifteen people can place me there.

16:36.146 --> 16:38.649
And all I have in my bag
is a half-eaten Snickers bar.

16:38.732 --> 16:42.152
- I want my phone call.
- Sure. After you answer some questions.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.780
[scoffs] About what?
I don't bang and I don't hang.

16:44.863 --> 16:47.157
I'm looking for Luke Cage.

16:47.240 --> 16:48.742
- What about Luke?
- You seen him?

16:49.326 --> 16:50.453
That's my man.

16:50.536 --> 16:52.370
- He's a good dude.
- That "good dude" killed a cop.

16:52.455 --> 16:53.747
There's no way he killed a cop.

16:53.831 --> 16:55.624
- You're lying.
- You calling me a liar?

16:55.708 --> 16:57.543
Luke Cage ain't kill no cop. No way.

16:57.626 --> 16:59.753
Look, unless you charging me
with something...

17:00.337 --> 17:02.840
I ain't gotta say squat. I'm leaving.

17:02.923 --> 17:05.217
You better sit your ass down!

17:05.300 --> 17:08.345
Luke Cage killed my training officer.

17:08.429 --> 17:11.557
He had a wife, twins your age.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.309
- Luke Cage ain't kill no cop.
- Look...

17:14.392 --> 17:16.520
you better start talking.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.276
Your hands are cold.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.325
All you had to do
was take the shrapnel out?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.411
It's like replacing
a burnt-out Christmas bulb.

17:34.329 --> 17:37.833
You repair the circuit,
the whole thing lights up again.

17:37.916 --> 17:39.167
It's miraculous.

17:40.085 --> 17:41.378
[sighs] It's no miracle.

17:42.379 --> 17:43.631
Wouldn't you say so?

17:44.757 --> 17:46.258
Miracles are good things.

17:46.341 --> 17:48.761
What's good about me being here, huh?

17:49.887 --> 17:51.805
All those prisoners who died.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.474
Reva's murder. For what?

17:54.099 --> 17:55.350
Immortality.

17:59.772 --> 18:01.565
What about those people you work for?

18:02.566 --> 18:03.692
Do they know I'm here?

18:04.317 --> 18:06.695
No. They barely keep tabs on me anymore.

18:07.445 --> 18:08.656
I don't believe that.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.700
You're too valuable not to keep tabs on.

18:11.784 --> 18:13.035
And you're not?

18:14.745 --> 18:18.666
Wounds healed instantaneously
on the battlefield.

18:19.583 --> 18:23.086
Concussions, major head trauma,
healed within hours.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.756
You're at the center of that.

18:30.135 --> 18:32.220
Cancer and HIV are next.

18:35.140 --> 18:37.267
[sighs] That's a lot
for me to think about.

18:40.353 --> 18:42.230
Right now, I just want my life back.

18:43.649 --> 18:45.108
Well, take your time.

18:46.401 --> 18:47.986
I'll be back.

18:48.070 --> 18:50.155
Help yourselves
to anything you like in the fridge.

18:52.533 --> 18:53.617
I don't trust him.

18:54.660 --> 18:55.703
Me neither.

18:56.704 --> 18:57.871
Reva's files.

19:00.123 --> 19:02.167
It's unlocked and unencrypted.

19:02.250 --> 19:03.627
What do you wanna know?

19:03.711 --> 19:06.296
[sighs] Reva.

19:07.130 --> 19:08.340
What she wouldn't tell me.

19:10.884 --> 19:13.971
Maybe we should just take the zip drive
and be on our way before he gets back.

19:15.013 --> 19:16.682
It might never be unlocked again.

19:17.891 --> 19:19.142
I gotta know.

19:21.478 --> 19:22.520
Which one?

19:23.521 --> 19:24.815
[Luke] That one.

19:24.898 --> 19:27.234
Tiara? That's a weird name.

19:27.317 --> 19:30.362
It's that thing I took off my head
after I escaped from the tank.

19:32.656 --> 19:34.199
That's my prison number.

19:35.576 --> 19:38.579
<i>Regarding subject Lucas, Carl...</i>

19:39.747 --> 19:41.373
<i>He's interesting.</i>

19:42.082 --> 19:45.210
<i>He's intelligent.</i>
<i>There's a fire that burns within.</i>

19:45.293 --> 19:48.421
<i>Even when he's not engaged,</i>
<i>you can always tell he's thinking.</i>

19:48.505 --> 19:49.882
<i>He's educated.</i>

19:49.965 --> 19:53.719
<i>He's not used to being incarcerated,</i>
<i>but he always carries himself with pride.</i>

19:53.802 --> 19:54.887
<i>I think he's one to watch.</i>

19:55.804 --> 19:56.972
Click seven.

19:58.599 --> 20:02.269
<i>Lucas' increasing loyalty</i>
<i>to Squabbles is an asset.</i>

20:02.352 --> 20:06.690
<i>I think Rackham's assertion</i>
<i>that Carl wanting to protect his friend</i>

20:06.774 --> 20:11.111
<i>will make him more willing to take part</i>
<i>in the fight trials is accurate.</i>

20:11.194 --> 20:12.696
[Luke breathes heavily]

20:12.780 --> 20:15.573
- Click 40.
- You sure, Luke?

20:17.951 --> 20:20.788
<i>Subject Lucas is beginning to unravel.</i>

20:20.871 --> 20:25.167
<i>He doesn't shave, he doesn't groom</i>
<i>and he lives to fight.</i>

20:25.250 --> 20:27.795
<i>He's actually beginning to hurt people.</i>

20:27.878 --> 20:30.297
<i>Physically, by far,</i>
<i>he's the best subject we've had.</i>

20:30.380 --> 20:33.634
<i>But it remains to be seen</i>
<i>if he'll be cleared for stage three.</i>

20:33.717 --> 20:37.805
<i>Every single subject</i>
<i>has died approaching that stage.</i>

20:38.555 --> 20:40.057
<i>If anyone can do it, he can.</i>

20:40.140 --> 20:41.266
[Luke sighs]

20:41.892 --> 20:43.435
[Burstein] You weren't supposed
to see that.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.564
- So what you got?
- They all said the same thing.

20:47.648 --> 20:49.817
Hoodie, Cage,
and they saw Jackie go flying.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.402
No other leads? We need something.

20:52.485 --> 20:56.489
Chief is up my ass.
Social media is blowin' up.

20:56.573 --> 20:57.950
This whole job has gone tactical.

20:58.033 --> 21:00.452
I don't want anyone from the Two-Nine
getting caught up in any bullshit.

21:00.535 --> 21:02.329
Everyone in Harlem has a camera.

21:02.412 --> 21:04.581
- Guess what? I got something.
- What?

21:04.665 --> 21:07.292
Willis Stryker.
Facial recognition just made a match.

21:07.375 --> 21:09.044
There's also a sealed juvenile record.

21:09.712 --> 21:12.005
That's it? Why is it sealed?

21:12.089 --> 21:13.799
[Bailey] It's past
the statute of limitations.

21:14.299 --> 21:15.801
Okay. So how can I get into it?

21:15.884 --> 21:18.095
Well, if you find a date
and a courthouse,

21:18.178 --> 21:20.222
and there was some press,
you might get lucky.

21:20.305 --> 21:22.307
[Lonnie] Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop, stop!

21:22.390 --> 21:23.475
- [man grunting]
- What in the hell is that?

21:23.558 --> 21:25.686
[officer 1] Hands off! Get him off!
[officer 2] Dorsey! Dorsey!

21:25.769 --> 21:27.645
[Dorsey] Where is he, huh?
[officer 2] Get off him, Dorsey!

21:27.730 --> 21:29.147
Where is he, punk? Huh?

21:29.231 --> 21:31.399
Why are you protecting him, huh?
Just tell me where he is.

21:31.483 --> 21:33.318
[Ridley shouting]
What the hell is going on?

21:38.240 --> 21:39.950
What the hell did you just do?

21:40.951 --> 21:42.703
[Luke breathing heavily]

21:44.496 --> 21:46.331
We were trash.

21:46.414 --> 21:48.416
You knew no one would care
if we were gone.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.086
That was the whole point
of Reva's therapy sessions.

21:51.169 --> 21:54.131
To separate the trash from the triumphant.

21:55.048 --> 21:58.635
[stutters] To pick out those subjects
that were most psychologically ready

21:58.719 --> 22:01.471
- to survive the process, Carl.
- Stop calling me that!

22:01.554 --> 22:03.181
I'm Luke.

22:03.265 --> 22:04.850
Carl died at Seagate.

22:05.768 --> 22:07.102
[Burstein scoffs]

22:07.185 --> 22:11.356
What, you're still pining
like a lovesick puppy for Reva?

22:11.439 --> 22:12.440
Please.

22:12.983 --> 22:14.442
She lied to everybody.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.029
That was her job.

22:17.112 --> 22:19.072
She lied to you about her involvement.

22:19.156 --> 22:21.033
I promise I'll explain it all.

22:21.116 --> 22:24.744
She lied again when she erased
both of you from existence.

22:24.828 --> 22:26.955
Thank you for saving my life.

22:27.497 --> 22:29.332
Thank you for changing mine.

22:30.292 --> 22:31.543
She knew the stakes.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.838
[sighs]

22:34.922 --> 22:35.923
You're...

22:37.299 --> 22:39.426
You're the future, Carl.

22:40.343 --> 22:42.345
You're a walking fountain of youth.

22:51.897 --> 22:54.107
My name is not Carl.

22:55.067 --> 22:56.693
I'm Luke Cage!

22:56.776 --> 22:57.986
[grunting]

23:01.990 --> 23:03.450
[yelling]

23:27.599 --> 23:30.518
You're never gonna do this
to anyone else ever again.

23:31.519 --> 23:33.146
How's that for stakes?

23:35.983 --> 23:38.068
- [sighs]
- Claire.

23:38.151 --> 23:40.112
Claire, you're brilliant.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.866
You're not even trained.
Imagine the things I could teach you.

23:44.908 --> 23:48.120
Talk to Luke.
Tell him what he's throwing away.

23:48.203 --> 23:49.872
He's my friend.

23:51.623 --> 23:53.458
And that's why you'll never see him again.

23:54.542 --> 23:55.710
Or this.

23:58.130 --> 24:00.298
You didn't say
I would never see you again.

24:01.884 --> 24:04.761
Be thankful I'm not the one
with the powers...

24:05.803 --> 24:09.807
because I'd kill you if you did
half the shit that you did to him to me.

24:10.976 --> 24:12.394
Not just ruin your barn.

24:14.312 --> 24:15.855
[breathing heavily]

24:49.347 --> 24:52.100
Carl Lucas is Luke Cage.

24:53.851 --> 24:56.479
- Hey. I found out that Willis...
- It's gonna have to wait.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.940
Officers.

24:58.023 --> 25:00.817
I am releasing these to the media

25:00.900 --> 25:04.696
in the next 15 minutes
so they can see the contrast.

25:04.779 --> 25:07.365
Don't make a bad situation even worse,
Councilwoman.

25:07.449 --> 25:09.201
You'd think a sister in charge
would change things.

25:09.284 --> 25:10.327
But you're blue,

25:10.410 --> 25:12.579
which makes you just as white
as anybody else!

25:12.662 --> 25:14.539
Luke Cage is a suspect
at large for murder,

25:14.622 --> 25:15.790
a number of other crimes.

25:15.873 --> 25:18.543
Luke Cage may be bulletproof,
but my boy isn't.

25:18.626 --> 25:20.170
Can't y'all understand that?

25:20.253 --> 25:22.214
Patty, Patty, save your words.

25:22.297 --> 25:24.924
- The only thing they understand is action.
- [Ridley] Mariah.

25:25.592 --> 25:27.719
Detective Dorsey has been arrested,
suspended without pay.

25:27.802 --> 25:29.012
We are taking formal steps to charge...

25:29.096 --> 25:31.889
No! Not enough, Priscilla. Not today.

25:32.975 --> 25:36.436
The death of that officer at the hand
of that super-freak was bad enough.

25:36.519 --> 25:38.521
But to beat down a child?

25:39.439 --> 25:41.899
Means you're not doing your job.
Come on.

25:42.484 --> 25:43.568
Patricia.

25:44.569 --> 25:48.490
- How's Lonnie?
- Keep my son's name out of your mouth.

25:53.828 --> 25:58.500
He's at Frederick Douglass Hospital
right now, getting checked out.

25:59.667 --> 26:00.918
Y'all gonna pay for this shit.

26:01.003 --> 26:03.255
Until you capture Luke Cage,

26:03.338 --> 26:06.383
and apologize to the people of Harlem,
we will...

26:06.466 --> 26:09.761
- bring this city to its knees.
- [crowd agreeing]

26:09.844 --> 26:15.975
All over Harlem, young black and brown men
are being slapped around by an NYPD

26:16.059 --> 26:19.062
too scared to do something
about Luke Cage.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.231
- [crowd agreeing]
- And because young Lonnie Wilson,

26:21.314 --> 26:22.774
our brother...

26:22.857 --> 26:25.402
just had the misfortune of knowing this...

26:25.485 --> 26:28.280
supposed superhero turned super-menace...

26:28.363 --> 26:32.534
[on TV] <i>he was beaten in custody</i>
<i>like it's 1956.</i>

26:32.617 --> 26:37.455
<i>Any time one of Harlem's finest is killed,</i>
<i>we all suffer.</i>

26:37.539 --> 26:41.543
But let's make sure that that outrage
is pointed in the right direction.

26:41.626 --> 26:46.589
I encourage the NYPD
to effectively arm themselves

26:46.673 --> 26:49.509
to protect the public, not to harass

26:49.592 --> 26:52.720
young brothers and sisters,
<i>hermanas y hermanos,</i>

26:52.804 --> 26:55.807
who are the lifeblood and the future
of our community.

26:55.890 --> 27:00.228
And I encourage that community
to rally with me at Harlem's Paradise.

27:00.312 --> 27:03.981
We will discuss our next plan
of non-violent action.

27:04.066 --> 27:05.733
Luke Cage must be found.

27:05.817 --> 27:07.319
- He must be stopped.
- [crowd agreeing]

27:07.402 --> 27:11.614
- This must never happen again.
- [crowd agreeing]

27:13.658 --> 27:15.077
[Ridley] Yes, Chief.

27:19.956 --> 27:21.708
Yes, sir.

27:24.627 --> 27:26.629
- [Ridley sighs]
- Do you have time to talk now?

27:26.713 --> 27:29.299
About what? About Mariah's little
"I Have a Dream" moment outside?

27:29.382 --> 27:32.385
About all the kids getting beaten up
by cops and the videos going viral?

27:32.469 --> 27:34.804
Something's off about this
and you know it.

27:35.763 --> 27:38.850
Why the hell would she hold that rally
at Harlem's Paradise?

27:38.933 --> 27:42.145
Shouldn't she be too spooked to even go
inside after what happened to her cousin?

27:43.563 --> 27:46.899
Cage did not kill Officer Albini.

27:46.983 --> 27:49.694
Nothing settles down until Cage
is in the box. We need to talk to him.

27:49.777 --> 27:52.572
- And I need to talk to Willis Stryker.
- Who is Stryker?

27:52.655 --> 27:56.326
I get the feeling that he is connected
to everything that's been going on.

27:56.409 --> 27:59.579
Cage, Cottonmouth, all of it.

28:00.163 --> 28:01.623
You'll need proof.

28:02.665 --> 28:03.833
I'm on it.

28:11.549 --> 28:14.219
[exhales] You swam that whole way?

28:14.886 --> 28:16.638
Doesn't seem as far away now.

28:18.140 --> 28:19.182
Hmm.

28:20.517 --> 28:22.810
[Luke] You ever hold
someone in your arms,

28:22.894 --> 28:25.147
hear them breathing against your chest,

28:25.230 --> 28:27.106
and you're in one emotional place...

28:28.275 --> 28:29.984
and they're in another?

28:31.110 --> 28:35.407
And you have absolutely no idea
what they're thinking.

28:35.490 --> 28:37.825
It's called having a boyfriend.

28:37.909 --> 28:39.202
[Luke chuckles softly]

28:46.376 --> 28:48.002
Reva lied to me.

28:48.878 --> 28:50.713
She helped you to disappear...

28:51.714 --> 28:53.425
because she was protecting you.

28:54.426 --> 28:57.512
- It couldn't have all been a lie.
- You don't understand.

28:57.595 --> 28:59.306
That woman?

28:59.389 --> 29:00.640
The idea of her...

29:01.683 --> 29:02.767
her smell...

29:02.850 --> 29:05.395
That was the only thing
that kept me sane at Seagate.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.689
That's what's eating me up inside.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.942
I don't think I really knew her at all.

29:12.735 --> 29:14.321
You still love her.

29:14.946 --> 29:16.239
I love...

29:17.324 --> 29:19.617
the idea of Reva.

29:22.329 --> 29:23.830
But not her, specifically.

29:25.540 --> 29:26.666
Not anymore.

29:28.585 --> 29:31.296
[sighs] I should just go, you know?

29:32.589 --> 29:34.966
I should just turn around
and walk away from all this shit.

29:35.049 --> 29:36.551
[scoffs]

29:36.634 --> 29:40.388
I wish you would've told me that,
what, 800 miles and 28 hours ago?

29:42.056 --> 29:43.933
I could have got some sleep.

29:46.811 --> 29:48.396
We've come too far.

29:49.772 --> 29:51.524
We're both in this now.

29:52.567 --> 29:53.568
Together.

29:53.651 --> 29:57.154
Look, it's...
It's a lot for me to take in all at once.

29:58.072 --> 29:59.574
[Claire sighs]

29:59.657 --> 30:01.826
I just need a plan, that's all.

30:03.995 --> 30:07.290
Willis hates me,
and I just need to figure out why.

30:08.916 --> 30:10.460
This was all so long ago.

30:12.670 --> 30:15.006
Savannah's the place
where all those answers are.

30:15.089 --> 30:17.425
The past is present for him.

30:18.593 --> 30:22.514
Whatever wounded him
has not cooled off at all.

30:23.806 --> 30:25.225
I trusted Reva...

30:26.809 --> 30:28.144
and I was wrong.

30:30.021 --> 30:31.689
How can I trust you?

30:32.940 --> 30:34.901
I never back down from a fight.

30:36.319 --> 30:38.112
Even if you don't trust me...

30:39.697 --> 30:41.324
trust the fighter in me.

30:44.536 --> 30:45.995
Fair enough.

31:02.970 --> 31:04.055
I'm driving.

31:10.270 --> 31:11.979
About time.

31:30.748 --> 31:32.834
- [switch clicks]
- Ah.

31:32.917 --> 31:34.126
[whirring]

31:58.234 --> 32:00.362
- [boxers grunting]
- Domingo.

32:02.071 --> 32:06.409
- Do I know you?
- No... but I know you.

32:07.118 --> 32:09.078
I've seen your rap sheet.

32:09.161 --> 32:11.914
How do you have time to commit crimes
and train boxers?

32:11.998 --> 32:15.377
I guess you must have to be
good at multitasking.

32:15.460 --> 32:17.086
- [chuckles]
- Yeah.

32:20.465 --> 32:22.299
I like boxing.

32:22.384 --> 32:23.968
You know what Mike Tyson once said?

32:24.051 --> 32:27.430
Uh, Mike Tyson mumbles too much
to say much of anything.

32:27.514 --> 32:29.098
No, Mike is great.

32:30.683 --> 32:34.354
He said, "Everyone has a plan...

32:34.437 --> 32:35.772
until they get hit."

32:35.855 --> 32:38.400
Well, sometimes you have to take a hit...

32:39.066 --> 32:41.110
before you can punch back.

32:42.529 --> 32:45.197
- And I know how to counterpunch.
- Mmm.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.037
Who's this?

32:52.288 --> 32:53.748
You tell me.

32:53.831 --> 32:56.543
Look, I saw you with Cottonmouth.

32:56.626 --> 32:58.169
I heard about your little beef.

32:58.252 --> 33:00.755
Beef? No beef.

33:00.838 --> 33:03.800
All I know is, Cottonmouth dies,
this guy shows up,

33:03.883 --> 33:06.343
and suddenly everything changes
all over again.

33:07.178 --> 33:08.555
Who is he?

33:11.433 --> 33:12.475
You come alone?

33:13.184 --> 33:14.477
Why are you asking me all this?

33:14.561 --> 33:18.272
Because everybody
is so focused on Luke Cage,

33:18.355 --> 33:22.569
nobody's talking about the fact
that the heads of the Jamaican, Haitian,

33:22.652 --> 33:25.362
and Cuban crime families
have all gone missing.

33:26.573 --> 33:28.282
I'd go to Harlem's Paradise.

33:29.617 --> 33:31.243
It's under new management.

33:35.915 --> 33:38.375
[speaking Spanish]

33:41.087 --> 33:42.129
[boxer grunts]

33:49.178 --> 33:50.597
[Claire] So this is it?

33:50.680 --> 33:52.014
It used to be.

33:53.307 --> 33:55.017
My grandfather built that sign.

33:55.643 --> 33:58.104
He founded this church
after he came home from World War II.

33:59.439 --> 34:00.773
He was a Red Tail.

34:01.691 --> 34:04.569
- Tuskegee Airman.
- Nice.

34:04.652 --> 34:08.781
He wanted a sign that was bold...
just like the tail of his plane.

34:11.576 --> 34:12.952
So what happened here?

34:13.911 --> 34:15.286
Why is everyone gone?

34:16.288 --> 34:17.540
I don't know.

34:35.891 --> 34:37.226
[Etta] James...

34:37.309 --> 34:40.103
Carl needs you now more than ever.

34:40.187 --> 34:41.898
How can you be here for your community

34:41.981 --> 34:44.734
and every other family
in the congregation,

34:44.817 --> 34:46.443
but you're never here for us?

34:47.612 --> 34:50.072
Stay out of grown folks' business.

34:50.156 --> 34:51.491
[young Luke] Yes, ma'am.

34:53.409 --> 34:54.827
Mama?

34:54.911 --> 34:57.329
Carl, come on.
I'm taking you to practice.

34:57.413 --> 34:59.582
[young Luke] All right.
Let me say goodbye to Daddy.

34:59.666 --> 35:01.083
I'll be waiting in the car.

35:02.001 --> 35:04.587
- Mrs. Lucas.
- Ms. Stryker.

35:37.954 --> 35:39.205
[man laughing in distance]

35:41.165 --> 35:42.917
[people conversing in distance]

35:49.131 --> 35:50.633
[books clatter]

35:56.889 --> 35:58.015
Carl.

35:59.058 --> 36:01.853
[Etta] Look, heffa.
You're not fooling nobody.

36:01.936 --> 36:04.021
You're little more than his hoe,
and we both know it.

36:04.105 --> 36:06.566
He lied to me too, Etta.
You think we're the only ones?

36:06.649 --> 36:08.109
You're through. And you're done.

36:08.192 --> 36:11.403
Are you kidding me?
Come at me again, bitch,

36:11.487 --> 36:13.197
and I won't hold my tongue
about Willie anymore.

36:13.280 --> 36:15.992
You say a word,
and the checks stop coming.

36:16.075 --> 36:18.535
He'll get pulled from Lieber Academy
so quick, your head...

36:18.620 --> 36:19.704
[Claire] Luke?

36:26.878 --> 36:28.295
Luke, are you all right?

36:29.255 --> 36:30.506
[breathing heavily]

36:34.093 --> 36:36.137
Willis Stryker...

36:36.220 --> 36:37.429
is my brother.

36:44.979 --> 36:47.148
I never wanted to accept it, but...

36:48.440 --> 36:49.441
it's real.

36:50.359 --> 36:52.569
- They never told you?
- No, no.

36:52.654 --> 36:54.030
No, no one dared.

36:54.113 --> 36:56.365
[breathing heavily]
It was all the little things.

36:56.448 --> 36:58.826
All the sideways glances during service.

36:58.910 --> 37:02.163
My mother hating on Willis,
even after he won the city championship.

37:02.246 --> 37:04.874
All my dad's convention trips with Dana.

37:04.957 --> 37:07.168
He was always so protective of her.

37:08.169 --> 37:09.295
Who's Dana?

37:10.337 --> 37:13.049
His secretary. Willis's mother.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.218
He was two years older than me.

37:16.302 --> 37:19.847
For years, my mother couldn't conceive,
and then one day, I...

37:19.931 --> 37:21.390
I came along.

37:22.474 --> 37:25.019
That's why everybody called me
the miracle baby.

37:26.145 --> 37:27.980
I hated that spotlight.

37:28.898 --> 37:30.316
They should have told you.

37:30.399 --> 37:33.485
Had Willis not framed me,
I wouldn't have gone to Seagate.

37:33.569 --> 37:35.487
No Seagate, no powers.

37:36.447 --> 37:37.865
Reva would still be alive.

37:38.825 --> 37:40.617
How is that your fault?

37:40.702 --> 37:44.330
It's not my fault.
My father started this whole thing.

37:45.206 --> 37:49.711
Willis hates me because
my father hates the idea of him.

37:50.627 --> 37:52.338
[chuckles]

37:52.421 --> 37:55.424
What he doesn't realize is that my father
never really liked me very much either.

37:55.507 --> 37:59.178
So where is this grand Reverend Lucas?
Why does he get a pass?

37:59.261 --> 38:00.596
Doesn't matter.

38:01.638 --> 38:04.851
Diamondback is after everything
and everyone that I've ever cared about.

38:05.893 --> 38:07.103
So it stops with me.

38:09.146 --> 38:10.982
I am my brother's keeper...

38:12.608 --> 38:14.235
whether I like it or not.

38:16.570 --> 38:17.947
It's on me.

38:24.661 --> 38:26.413
[indistinct chatter]

38:29.834 --> 38:32.754
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

38:32.837 --> 38:36.257
This stops now! This stops now!

38:36.340 --> 38:37.800
This stops now!

38:37.884 --> 38:40.928
Yes, it does. Yes, it does.

38:41.012 --> 38:43.973
Oh, it warms my heart
to see you here this evening.

38:44.056 --> 38:45.474
[man] Good to see you, too.

38:46.683 --> 38:49.478
My cousin, Cornell Stokes...

38:50.687 --> 38:53.107
was murdered right where you're standing,

38:53.900 --> 38:55.777
and it pains me to even be here.

38:56.693 --> 38:58.445
- But it's necessary.
- [crowd agreeing]

38:59.739 --> 39:02.909
Luke Cage murdered my cousin,

39:02.992 --> 39:05.787
and I am not afraid to speak out about it.

39:05.870 --> 39:08.831
The man is a liar, he is a menace,

39:08.915 --> 39:14.170
and as long as he is running around loose,
hiding amongst us, no one is safe.

39:14.253 --> 39:15.296
- [crowd murmurs]
- [man] Ain't none of us safe!

39:15.379 --> 39:18.800
Now, I know what brought us
here tonight.

39:18.883 --> 39:23.805
The police putting their hands
on yet another young black man.

39:23.888 --> 39:24.972
It's wrong.

39:25.056 --> 39:27.183
- It is wrong.
- [crowd agreeing]

39:27.266 --> 39:29.936
No doubt about that. But...

39:31.062 --> 39:33.522
we cannot lose focus here.

39:33.605 --> 39:38.820
A cop was killed
by this super-powered menace.

39:38.903 --> 39:43.324
And our young brother was hurt
during their witch-hunt.

39:44.325 --> 39:45.617
Brothers and sisters...

39:46.327 --> 39:48.579
our world has changed.

39:48.662 --> 39:53.835
- We have new threats, new terrorists.
- [man] Yeah.

39:53.918 --> 39:57.046
That woman over in Hell's Kitchen
snapped a man's neck

39:57.129 --> 39:59.673
because he was mind-controlling her.

39:59.756 --> 40:00.757
[crowd murmuring]

40:00.842 --> 40:04.887
We got a bulletproof murderer
on the loose in Harlem

40:04.971 --> 40:09.809
with his own twisted sense of justice,
putting us all in harm's way.

40:09.892 --> 40:11.060
[crowd murmuring]

40:11.143 --> 40:12.478
Do I trust the cops?

40:13.562 --> 40:16.065
- [man] No. Hell no.
- Not blindly.

40:16.148 --> 40:20.820
- [crowd agreeing]
- We need protection from Luke Cage.

40:20.903 --> 40:25.616
We need protection from
the other powered people like Luke Cage.

40:25.699 --> 40:27.784
He is the real threat!

40:27.869 --> 40:29.453
[crowd agreeing]

40:33.040 --> 40:36.710
We need to arm our men and women in blue

40:36.793 --> 40:39.255
so that they can protect us.

40:39.338 --> 40:40.756
Truly protect us

40:40.840 --> 40:45.469
and never confuse us
with those who are the real threat.

40:45.552 --> 40:47.263
- [crowd cheering]
- You stay strong!

40:53.602 --> 40:55.646
I know you will stay strong

40:55.729 --> 40:58.357
and I know you will welcome
to this mike right now,

40:58.440 --> 41:00.860
- Reverend John Pope!
- [crowd cheering]

41:06.615 --> 41:08.784
Emails. Make sure you get emails
and a head count.

41:08.868 --> 41:12.038
- [man] Consider it done, ma'am.
- Oh! I didn't know you got off work.

41:12.121 --> 41:14.331
- Hey. How you doing?
- [laughs]

41:14.415 --> 41:16.292
- [John] Because you are here.
- Excuse me.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.877
[John] That means that you care.

41:17.960 --> 41:19.420
Are you that desperate?

41:20.087 --> 41:21.130
What do you mean?

41:21.213 --> 41:23.590
You're just using that kid
to stay politically viable

41:23.674 --> 41:27.219
even though Brenda's still gonna force
your crooked ass off the city council.

41:27.303 --> 41:29.346
I don't know what you're talking about.

41:29.430 --> 41:32.724
You know damn well Luke Cage
didn't kill that poor cop.

41:32.808 --> 41:35.602
Everyone knows he's the one
who busted up Cottonmouth's...

41:35.686 --> 41:37.813
- Cornell.
- Cottonmouth's operation

41:37.897 --> 41:39.273
at Crispus Attucks

41:39.356 --> 41:43.610
and that $7 million in blood money
that came out of your office.

41:45.112 --> 41:49.158
Cornell dies,
Brenda and the rest of the party back off

41:49.241 --> 41:51.202
and your popularity surges.

41:52.286 --> 41:54.788
But I see right through you, Mariah.

41:56.165 --> 41:57.458
How dare you.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.751
You can't be trusted.

41:59.835 --> 42:03.923
Who needs trust when you have power?

42:04.006 --> 42:05.674
[crowd cheering and applauding]

42:20.064 --> 42:21.190
Yo, Luke.

42:26.070 --> 42:27.696
I won't say nothing.

42:32.868 --> 42:34.578
You're not going, are you?

42:37.414 --> 42:39.041
Why not?

42:39.125 --> 42:42.003
Nothing like a warm welcome
from Mariah Dillard.

42:46.882 --> 42:48.800
[crowd cheering and applauding]

42:48.884 --> 42:52.096
Now, he calls himself a friend.

42:52.179 --> 42:55.141
- [woman] He ain't my friend!
- But by his actions...

42:55.224 --> 42:57.934
we know that this is false.

42:58.019 --> 42:59.895
- [crowd agreeing]
- Now, can you say "false"?

42:59.979 --> 43:01.355
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Say it again.

43:01.438 --> 43:02.939
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Mean it this time!

43:03.024 --> 43:04.316
- [crowd] False!
- [John] Yes!

43:04.400 --> 43:06.652
- False! Yeah.
- [crowd applauding]

43:06.735 --> 43:08.195
Now...

43:08.862 --> 43:12.241
Luke Cage has a lot to prove to us.

43:12.866 --> 43:16.620
What is he? Where does he come from?

43:16.703 --> 43:18.872
And will more come like him?

43:19.956 --> 43:25.171
And does his presence here mean
that we will be endangered? Endangered...

43:25.254 --> 43:26.838
by superhuman threats?

43:27.839 --> 43:29.425
Now, I want you...

43:30.009 --> 43:31.427
to follow me this evenin'.

43:32.344 --> 43:33.679
From the bottom of your heart.

43:33.762 --> 43:35.764
No, no, no, not from the top,
or the middle.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.183
From the bottom of your heart.

43:37.266 --> 43:39.185
- This...
- [crowd] This...

43:39.268 --> 43:40.311
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- [John] Stops!

43:40.394 --> 43:41.978
- [crowd] Stops!
- [John] Now!

43:42.063 --> 43:44.148
- You sure that's a good idea?
- [John] This stops now!

43:44.231 --> 43:45.774
Misty's gonna need backup.

43:46.317 --> 43:47.818
[crowd chanting] This stops now!

43:47.901 --> 43:49.820
This stops now!

43:49.903 --> 43:51.322
Be careful.

43:51.405 --> 43:53.449
[crowd continues chanting]

43:53.532 --> 43:55.159
Always.

43:55.242 --> 43:56.452
You're so corny.

43:56.535 --> 43:59.621
[crowd chanting] This stops now!
This stops now!

43:59.705 --> 44:02.833
This stops now! This stops now!

44:02.916 --> 44:04.501
[chanting continues]

44:19.516 --> 44:22.519
[chanting continues]

44:47.419 --> 44:48.754
[Stryker] Hey, baby.

44:48.837 --> 44:51.047
- You miss me?
- Put your hands where I can see 'em!

44:51.132 --> 44:52.174
You're under arrest.

44:52.258 --> 44:54.635
Nah. Not today.

44:55.594 --> 44:57.179
- [grunts]
- [crowd screaming]

45:01.016 --> 45:02.309
[grunting]

45:04.395 --> 45:06.147
That's Luke Cage! He's here!

45:14.196 --> 45:15.614
[man] There he is. Get him!

45:28.419 --> 45:31.087
- [grunts]
- [Misty breathing heavily]

45:31.172 --> 45:33.131
[crowd screaming]

45:34.800 --> 45:36.802
[rapid gunfire]

46:01.076 --> 46:02.286
[softly] I got you.

46:03.204 --> 46:04.205
You hear me?

46:05.121 --> 46:06.207
I got you.
