WEBVTT

00:09.183 --> 00:10.532
For your safety and security,

00:10.575 --> 00:12.925
and per our regulations,
we ask that you do not

00:12.969 --> 00:15.406
leave your luggage
unattended at any time.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.541
Do you like Munchers?

00:19.584 --> 00:21.021
My daughter does.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.240
I got a free one. Help me out.

00:23.284 --> 00:24.502
Sure, thanks.

00:24.546 --> 00:25.851
Have a good flight.

00:25.895 --> 00:27.505
Hey.

00:29.855 --> 00:30.813
Hey.

00:30.856 --> 00:32.858
Um, so...

00:36.297 --> 00:37.907
Excuse me.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.561
Are you sure
you want to interrupt?

00:39.604 --> 00:41.476
She looks like
she can handle herself.

00:41.519 --> 00:44.392
Fake laugh. She's trying
to get rid of him.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.481
No, no, no, it's fake
'cause she likes him.

00:46.524 --> 00:49.223
You may know women,
but I know my daughter.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.615
The pre-boarding announcement

00:50.659 --> 00:52.095
for Cartier Air Flight 617...

00:54.141 --> 00:55.814
We're now inviting those
passengers requiring...

00:55.838 --> 00:57.231
Munchers?

00:57.274 --> 00:59.276
I hate Munchers.

01:00.756 --> 01:03.846
I found a way to upgrade your
seat so we can sit together.

01:03.889 --> 01:06.675
Do you want me
to do that? I'm fine in economy.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.392
I routed my trip
through Chicago specifically

01:08.416 --> 01:09.373
to accompany you to Vancouver.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.202
Dad, I will be 25 feet away.

01:12.246 --> 01:13.247
Don't worry.

01:13.290 --> 01:15.466
I'll come and check on you.

01:15.510 --> 01:17.512
Okay.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.998
She won't even sit with me.

01:26.042 --> 01:29.611
Why didn't you just
sit her with us to begin with?

01:29.654 --> 01:31.221
Her mother booked her tickets,

01:31.265 --> 01:33.702
but then she got pulled to
Hong Kong at the last minute

01:33.745 --> 01:35.660
since our conference
is in Vancouver.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.445
Anyway, I figured...

01:39.099 --> 01:41.231
We don't let Evie
travel alone anymore.

01:41.275 --> 01:43.451
Why?

01:43.494 --> 01:46.671
Last time she flew alone,
she was kidnapped.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.588
My God. Yeah.

01:50.632 --> 01:52.199
This is the boarding
announcement for.

01:52.242 --> 01:54.810
Cartier Air Flight 617
to Vancouver. That's us.

01:54.853 --> 01:58.292
We're inviting all passengers
to begin boarding at this time.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.818
Welcome to Cartier Flight 617.Thanks.

02:02.861 --> 02:05.037
Here we are.
Welcome to Cartier...

02:05.081 --> 02:06.561
Do you need help
finding your seat?

02:06.604 --> 02:08.737
Yeah, yes. Right down this aisle.

02:08.780 --> 02:12.001
So you're telling me
that she actually said yes?

02:12.044 --> 02:13.263
What?

02:13.307 --> 02:14.830
You're so full of crap.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.851
And she's gonna be in Vancouver
the whole time we're there.

02:16.875 --> 02:18.007
Dude, that's crazy.

02:18.050 --> 02:19.182
Gentlemen.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.184
Not the time, not the place.

02:21.228 --> 02:23.317
Excuse me.

02:23.360 --> 02:24.883
Sure.

02:26.885 --> 02:30.019
So what happened?
Who kidnapped Evie?

02:30.062 --> 02:32.630
It's a story for another day.

02:32.674 --> 02:34.415
Munchers?

02:34.458 --> 02:35.329
No, thanks.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.200
Okay.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.332
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:38.375 --> 02:39.594
this is the captain speaking.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.378
We'll be departing
in a few moments.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.206
Weather report
shows sunny skies...

02:43.250 --> 02:44.294
Hey.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.991
It's Evie, right?

02:46.035 --> 02:48.124
Looks like
we're sitting together.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.083
This isn't 14F.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.389
Okay, yeah.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.826
You caught me.
Switched seats with my teammate.

02:54.870 --> 02:56.524
Well, your transparency
is astounding.

02:56.567 --> 02:58.047
A-And charming?

02:58.090 --> 03:00.136
Little bit.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.836
Tighten your seatbelt.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.751
Bad things happen when I travel.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.164
Flight attendants
prepare for takeoff.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.406
Okay.

03:13.976 --> 03:16.674
Sir, coffee? Something to drink?

03:16.718 --> 03:18.807
Last night, we won,
so we snuck up onto the roof,

03:18.850 --> 03:20.287
and, you know, we were partying,

03:20.330 --> 03:23.464
and, as a joke, um,
some of the guys

03:23.507 --> 03:25.640
locked the three of us
onto the roof all night.

03:25.683 --> 03:28.251
You know,
so we'd missed breakfast,

03:28.295 --> 03:30.360
we missed the bus,
and then we ended up... Having fun, Bower?

03:30.384 --> 03:32.516
No, sir.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.174
He okay?

03:38.218 --> 03:40.176
He's a hard-ass.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.787
But he knows how to coach.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.267
I'm just glad

03:44.311 --> 03:45.964
she's spending
more time in Chicago now.

03:46.008 --> 03:49.968
She was away from her
grandfather for too long.

03:50.012 --> 03:51.361
Away from me, too.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.580
Why?

03:54.799 --> 03:56.584
Bruno?

03:57.802 --> 04:00.588
Bruno, open the door. Come on.

04:00.631 --> 04:01.763
What's going on?

04:01.806 --> 04:03.286
I know you can hear me.
Open the door.

04:03.330 --> 04:04.853
The captain's locked out.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.903
Everything all right?

04:11.947 --> 04:15.603
Yes, sir, everything's fine.
Please, return to your seat.

04:16.647 --> 04:18.649
Captain.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.781
Just returning
from the washroom.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.697
Copilot's not responding. You try the code?

04:22.740 --> 04:24.220
He overrode it.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.875
Listen, I'm a
professional negotiator.

04:26.918 --> 04:28.180
Maybe I can help.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.270
Well, you can help
by returning to your seat.

04:31.836 --> 04:33.490
Sir, the captain is busy.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.251
Please take your seat. I
thought cockpit doors

04:35.275 --> 04:37.277
were impossible to open
from the outside.

04:37.320 --> 04:40.236
We have a code in case the pilot
suffers a medical emergency.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.369
Must just be a
technical issue. All right.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.591
What is going on?

04:47.635 --> 04:50.028
Copilot.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.335
I think he just
hijacked the plane.

04:54.000 --> 05:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.800 --> 05:24.628
We need the captain on our side.

05:24.672 --> 05:28.066
I agree, but he's definitely
the take charge type.

05:28.110 --> 05:29.590
Maybe he'll listen to a woman.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.505
They rarely do.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.072
Right.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.646
That's normal, right?

05:42.690 --> 05:43.691
Captain, I'm sorry.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.867
What-what's going on?

05:45.910 --> 05:47.695
Just some turbulence up ahead.

05:47.738 --> 05:50.306
The copilot's diverting,
that's all.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.656
Perhaps the passengers
should be reassured.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.702
Yeah.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.578
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Tremblay.

06:01.622 --> 06:03.382
Due to some turbulence up ahead,
we are making

06:03.406 --> 06:04.929
a slight course correction.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.061
Please, just enjoy

06:06.104 --> 06:09.325
the rest of the flight.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.327
Okay, Captain,
what's really going on?

06:11.371 --> 06:13.373
Or do you always stand
outside the cockpit door

06:13.416 --> 06:14.461
when there's turbulence?

06:14.504 --> 06:15.897
As Eric said,

06:15.940 --> 06:18.247
we're negotiators.
What have you got to lose?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.471
The copilot's flying us south.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.037
Is he talking? Made any demands?

06:26.081 --> 06:26.908
No.

06:26.951 --> 06:27.972
Nothing but silence so far.

06:27.996 --> 06:29.519
But as long as the Wi-Fi is up,

06:29.563 --> 06:31.956
I can make calls, so I'm
gonna contact flight center

06:32.000 --> 06:33.958
to find out if they have
any idea why my copilot

06:34.002 --> 06:35.482
isn't responding.

06:35.525 --> 06:38.310
Look, his name is Bruno Lessio.

06:40.704 --> 06:44.621
Why would a copilot
divert his own plane? Terrorism?

06:44.665 --> 06:46.449
Or a suicide.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.756
Why not just crash the plane?

06:48.799 --> 06:50.603
Well, jumpers often stand
on a ledge for hours.

06:50.627 --> 06:53.587
I mean, the fact that he's not
sure is to our advantage.

06:53.630 --> 06:56.416
Call Zara. I'm gonna talk to Bruno.
Okay.

07:04.641 --> 07:06.817
It's Cynthia.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.558
Hey.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.082
Hey, Zara.
We have a situation here.

07:11.126 --> 07:15.957
Bruno, my name's Eric Beaumont.
I'm a professional negotiator.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.320
Now, the first rule
of negotiation

07:17.349 --> 07:19.221
is to find out
what the person needs,

07:19.264 --> 07:21.484
and then find a way
to give it to them, so...

07:21.528 --> 07:24.269
how can I help?

07:27.272 --> 07:29.361
You know, if you don't
want to talk to me,

07:29.405 --> 07:32.016
is there anyone out here
that you would like to talk to?

07:34.018 --> 07:35.498
Can I hear your voice?

07:35.542 --> 07:39.154
Just to know that you're okay.

07:39.197 --> 07:41.243
Please?

07:43.550 --> 07:45.813
We need to find out everything
we can about the copilot,

07:45.856 --> 07:47.510
Bruno Lessio.

07:47.554 --> 07:48.642
Okay, I'm on it.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.208
All right, and I'll
contact the FAA.

07:50.252 --> 07:52.341
Let us know if you guys
need anything else.

07:52.384 --> 07:53.647
What about some parachutes?

07:56.780 --> 07:58.105
You know,
if you don't want to talk

07:58.129 --> 07:59.696
through the door,
Bruno, let me in.

07:59.740 --> 08:02.569
Then if you change your mind
and want me to leave, I will go.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.528
Progress?

08:05.572 --> 08:07.530
No.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.532
Becky, do you know him?

08:09.576 --> 08:12.709
Not really. We've crewed a
couple of short hauls together.

08:12.753 --> 08:15.538
He's serious. Quiet.

08:15.582 --> 08:16.757
Depressed?

08:20.195 --> 08:22.502
Bruno, you want
some food or a drink?

08:24.112 --> 08:26.375
You know, if you don't want
to answer my questions,

08:26.418 --> 08:27.858
maybe you'd like
to ask me something?

08:27.898 --> 08:28.943
Yes.

08:28.986 --> 08:30.640
Go ahead.

08:30.684 --> 08:33.774
Do you believe in Hell?

08:33.817 --> 08:36.211
Becky? Becky?

08:36.254 --> 08:38.342
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey. Listen to me.God.

08:38.386 --> 08:40.365
Listen to me. I-I need you
to keep it together, okay?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.825
Yeah?

08:43.827 --> 08:45.699
It sounds like
you're a moral person.

08:45.742 --> 08:47.570
That's, that's great to hear.

08:47.614 --> 08:51.574
Would you like to talk to
a religious or spiritual leader?

08:54.534 --> 08:57.188
Come on, Bruno. What's going on?
Where are we going?

08:57.232 --> 08:58.973
Denver.

08:59.016 --> 09:01.018
Why Denver?

09:03.673 --> 09:06.154
He says we're going to Denver.
How long will that take?

09:06.197 --> 09:09.026
90 minutes.

09:09.070 --> 09:09.940
Captain, what are you doing?

09:09.984 --> 09:11.376
Talking to flight center.

09:11.420 --> 09:13.770
We're finding a way in there.
Is that possible?

09:13.814 --> 09:16.425
Well, we're gonna
make it possible.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.994
The FAA is gonna instruct

09:20.037 --> 09:22.736
the captain to give you and Eric
his full cooperation,

09:22.779 --> 09:25.173
but it's at his discretion.

09:25.216 --> 09:28.045
He's hardly discreet.
Any idea why Denver?

09:28.089 --> 09:30.918
No one has a clue.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.050
There's nothing that connects
the copilot to Denver,

09:33.094 --> 09:35.289
he's never flown there, and
there's nothing going on there.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.314
I'm looking at the guy's

09:36.358 --> 09:37.446
social media page.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.013
He has friends, family.

09:39.056 --> 09:41.493
Bruno Lessio seems
like a pretty happy guy.

09:41.537 --> 09:44.627
Bought an apartment
in Montreal six months ago.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.431
Promising career.
He even made plans this weekend.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.848
Yeah, he doesn't sound suicidal.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.458
What is it, then? OLIVER: I don't know.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.460
We're gonna go
check out Bruno's apartment.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.070
Police are on their
way there now.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.158
We'll be in touch.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.464
Hey.

09:55.507 --> 09:56.659
Bruno, this is Captain Tremblay.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.423
If you do not open this door,

09:58.467 --> 10:00.643
I am gonna take a crash axe
and pry open a panel

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
until I get to the avionics bay.

10:02.471 --> 10:04.821
Then I am gonna start pulling
out hydraulic circuit boards

10:04.865 --> 10:06.649
until you can
no longer fly the plane.

10:06.693 --> 10:07.781
Do you under...

10:07.824 --> 10:10.435
Your threats will not
persuade him, sir.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.916
Well, your talk isn't exactly
persuading him either, is it?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.657
Maybe Bruno will land
the plane in Denver.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.617
No, pilot hijackings
generally mean pilot suicides.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.967
If he attempts to fly us
over downtown Denver,

10:20.010 --> 10:22.665
the Air Force is gonna knock us
out of the sky, do you get that?

10:22.709 --> 10:25.233
If you rip out the electronics,
then who's gonna fly the plane?

10:25.276 --> 10:27.235
I will know which circuits
work and which won't.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.846
I will have ground
operation support, he won't.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.543
But you'd have to get inside.

10:31.587 --> 10:32.806
Yes.

10:32.849 --> 10:34.634
What about autopilot?

10:34.677 --> 10:36.853
Autopilot does not land
a plane like this.

10:36.897 --> 10:40.291
Listen, if we do not open that
door and get inside, we die.

10:40.335 --> 10:41.945
Captain.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.860
Can you tell us what's
happening, please?

10:43.904 --> 10:46.297
Yeah, of-of course I can.
I'm so sorry.

10:46.341 --> 10:48.473
Yo, guys, guys.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.650
Um, did you hear
what's going on up there?

10:50.693 --> 10:52.695
I heard someone said
there's a hijacking.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.175
- No way.
- That's insane.

10:54.218 --> 10:57.831
Would you guys be willing
to give me a hand?

10:57.874 --> 11:01.138
I'm their coach.
What's going on?

11:01.182 --> 11:04.054
Well, we have a situation.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.449
My God, I'm cursed.

11:07.492 --> 11:10.757
Bruno, open the cockpit door, or the
captain's gonna do something rash.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.542
Now, I can come in and broker an
arrangement between the two of you.

11:13.585 --> 11:16.806
Whatever the problem is,
we cansolve it.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.199
Okay.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.375
Captain Tremblay can come in.

11:20.418 --> 11:21.419
But no one else.

11:21.463 --> 11:23.639
Eric.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.555
Listen, he's willing
to let you back in,

11:26.598 --> 11:28.339
but everybody else
has to stand back, okay?

11:28.383 --> 11:29.601
Those are his terms.

11:29.645 --> 11:31.734
Okay. Okay. I can take this.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.823
Why is he letting me back in?

11:33.867 --> 11:37.044
Maybe he changed his mind.
Could be a trick.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.002
Maybe. But, Captain,
no pressure on him, okay?

11:39.046 --> 11:41.222
Don't threaten.
Just... let him talk.

11:41.265 --> 11:42.702
And listen.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.097
If you're calm,
he's calm, all right?

11:53.669 --> 11:55.845
My eyes! My eyes!

11:55.889 --> 11:57.978
Go, go, go!

11:58.021 --> 12:00.328
Guys, no, stop!
The door is impenetrable!

12:00.371 --> 12:01.764
You're only gonna provoke him!

12:01.808 --> 12:03.026
Open the door! Get back.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.767
Get off! Get back!

12:20.827 --> 12:23.046
Enough, Bruno.
We get the message.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.318
Anybody hurt?

12:34.362 --> 12:35.929
Are you okay?

12:35.972 --> 12:38.148
Everybody okay?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.933
Yeah.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.457
Yeah, we're okay. You?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.937
Yeah, I'm fine. Evie?

12:43.980 --> 12:45.895
Yeah, I'm okay, except...

12:45.939 --> 12:47.767
now the only person
who can land the plane

12:47.810 --> 12:49.090
is the guy who's gonna crash it.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.901
Yeah.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.667
I'm okay, Dad. No, it's okay.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.974
If you need me, just tell the flight...
We got it.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.323
Okay. Just stay in your seat

13:22.366 --> 13:24.455
with your seat belt on.

13:24.499 --> 13:25.805
Both of you.

13:25.935 --> 13:27.328
Is Evie okay?

13:27.371 --> 13:29.243
She's a trouper.
What about the captain?

13:29.286 --> 13:31.114
We flushed out as
much as we could.

13:31.158 --> 13:33.421
His vision impairment
is only temporary.

13:33.464 --> 13:35.162
But I'm not an ophthalmologist.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.728
Who are you guys?

13:38.426 --> 13:39.993
We're professional negotiators.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.474
The man in the cockpit can still
land the plane, and he will.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.128
We just need to persuade him.

13:45.172 --> 13:47.217
The key here is not to panic.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.021
Outside this plane,
there are thousands of people

13:49.045 --> 13:51.482
figuring out what to do,
so we're not alone.

13:52.657 --> 13:54.224
Good speech.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.313
I just wish I believed it.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.967
Now what?

13:58.011 --> 14:00.752
I saw Bruno earlier
in the boarding area.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.972
What was his mood? Good.

14:03.016 --> 14:05.366
I spoke to him;
He was pleasant, smiling.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.716
He gave me the Munchers, but...

14:07.759 --> 14:10.675
I sensed only fear and
resignation from the cockpit.

14:10.719 --> 14:12.155
Well, what changed?

14:12.199 --> 14:13.983
Exactly.

14:25.168 --> 14:26.866
Clear to enter.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.695
Police! Police!

14:33.307 --> 14:35.004
Okay, thank you.

14:35.048 --> 14:37.572
Eric. I'm glad you called.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.791
I just had two quick minutes
with Montreal police.

14:39.835 --> 14:42.055
Bruno has no criminal history,
and his doctor says

14:42.098 --> 14:44.405
there's no indication
of drug abuse.

14:44.448 --> 14:46.581
He hasn't been diagnosed
with a mental illness.

14:46.624 --> 14:48.452
He isn't taking antidepressants.

14:48.496 --> 14:49.149
I saw Bruno

14:49.192 --> 14:50.411
before we boarded.

14:50.454 --> 14:52.500
Now, he took a call.
Maybe he got bad news.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.284
Can you check his incoming? We already did.

14:54.328 --> 14:57.592
His last call was from
his ex, a Fiona Stemkowska.

14:57.635 --> 14:59.681
She lives across the street.
That's how they met.

14:59.724 --> 15:00.745
Well, I want to talk to her.

15:00.769 --> 15:01.944
She's on her way.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.641
In fact...

15:05.078 --> 15:07.123
here she is right now.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.737
Eric, we'll call you right back.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.043
Hi.

15:14.087 --> 15:17.003
Hi.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.964
Bruno, it's Eric Beaumont again.

15:22.008 --> 15:24.184
We met earlier.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.273
You gave me the Munchers,
remember?

15:28.188 --> 15:30.146
You got what you wanted, Bruno.

15:30.190 --> 15:31.800
Captain Tremblay
is incapacitated.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.933
You are in full control.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.979
Whatever you think is in Denver,
maybe I can help you find it.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.763
No one can help me.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.940
Why?

15:40.983 --> 15:43.943
Come on, what's gonna happen
if you tell me?

15:45.248 --> 15:47.468
Once we get to Denver

15:47.511 --> 15:48.967
and you've found
what you're looking for,

15:48.991 --> 15:51.124
will you be happy?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.821
I'll never be happy.

15:52.864 --> 15:56.912
But at least it will stop.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.262
What will stop, Bruno?

16:04.789 --> 16:06.139
Oliver.

16:07.357 --> 16:09.620
So, I'm with Fiona Stemkowska.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.709
I've briefed her
on the situation.

16:11.753 --> 16:13.929
She said she broke up with
Bruno three weeks ago.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.062
Why'd you break up
with him, Fiona?

16:16.105 --> 16:19.935
I-I'm a single mom.
Ethan is my life.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.893
I-I could just tell
Bruno would never commit.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.330
Was the breakup bitter?

16:23.373 --> 16:26.115
No. If anything,
he was relieved.

16:26.159 --> 16:27.377
And the call today?

16:27.421 --> 16:29.292
Friendly.
I-I had left some things

16:29.336 --> 16:31.077
at his place,
and I wanted to know

16:31.120 --> 16:33.122
when I could
pick them up. Okay, here's the point.

16:33.166 --> 16:35.733
Fiona said Bruno
would wake up screaming,

16:35.777 --> 16:36.952
shaking, sweating.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.606
I tried to talk to him

16:38.649 --> 16:40.956
about it, but... he clams up.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.827
Classic post-traumatic stress
syndrome.

16:42.871 --> 16:44.960
Do you know why he'd have PTSS?

16:45.004 --> 16:47.049
No. We can't figure it out.

16:47.093 --> 16:50.531
Okay. Fiona, do you think
if you talked to Bruno,

16:50.574 --> 16:52.837
you could persuade him
to land the plane?

16:53.664 --> 16:56.102
I could give it a try.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.147
So the best way

16:58.191 --> 17:00.671
to reach Bruno is
to show him that you care.

17:00.715 --> 17:01.977
So try to find a way

17:02.021 --> 17:04.022
to express it. Okay.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.724
Okay, we're ready.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.944
Bruno, I have someone
who wants to talk to you.

17:13.989 --> 17:15.034
Bruno?

17:15.077 --> 17:17.297
Fiona?

17:19.125 --> 17:21.953
I don't know what's going on.

17:21.997 --> 17:26.088
You're-you're scaring
a lot of people.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.395
That's not like you.

17:28.438 --> 17:30.962
Open the door.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.095
Land the plane.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.706
You won't be alone.
You'll have me and Ethan.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.709
I want to be alone.

17:38.753 --> 17:39.971
No, Bruno...

17:40.015 --> 17:42.104
I care about you, Fi.

17:42.148 --> 17:45.194
I do, I love you, and I...

17:45.238 --> 17:47.240
I love Ethan, too.

17:47.283 --> 17:50.460
But you're better off
without me.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.114
So is the world.

17:52.158 --> 17:53.637
Bruno.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.945
Bruno, please.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.780
You were in a good mood
earlier, Bruno.

18:05.823 --> 18:07.521
What happened?
Did you talk to someone?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.653
Did you see something?

18:14.005 --> 18:15.964
Becky.

18:16.007 --> 18:19.968
Is there a list of
the passengers we can access?

18:20.011 --> 18:22.405
On the airline's Internet.

18:22.449 --> 18:25.843
We can see everything
the flight center sees.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.280
Why?

18:27.323 --> 18:29.195
My colleagues on the ground...

18:29.238 --> 18:30.979
I want them to have full access.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.565
It's possible Bruno recognized
one of the passengers

18:32.589 --> 18:34.156
in the waiting area
when he boarded.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.376
Maybe that's what triggered him.

18:36.419 --> 18:37.638
Here.

18:37.681 --> 18:39.770
I'll see what I can do.

18:39.814 --> 18:41.816
Thank you.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.733
Okay, Becky, I'm in. Thanks.

18:45.776 --> 18:47.169
What are you doing?

18:47.213 --> 18:49.432
Flight manifest.
Seeing who's on board.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.566
Look, Bruno's passport
from when he was a kid.

18:52.609 --> 18:56.439
But the name reads
Bruno Venturi, not Bruno Lessio.

18:56.483 --> 18:58.311
He changed his name.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.748
Looks like it.

19:06.841 --> 19:08.799
He still won't open the door.

19:08.843 --> 19:10.801
God, we're gonna die.

19:10.845 --> 19:14.414
No, we're not, okay? My dad
can talk anyone into anything.

19:14.457 --> 19:15.589
We shouldn't be here, man.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.132
We should be
with the rest of the team.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.461
None of this would be happening.

19:18.505 --> 19:21.464
Yeah, well, we're not. Are we?
I-I'm sorry, guys.

19:21.508 --> 19:23.814
It's not your fault, man.
Don't worry about it.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.052
Yeah, man, don't worry about it.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.513
What are you guys talking about?

19:26.556 --> 19:27.620
Is it about the roof party?

19:27.644 --> 19:28.732
What roof party?

19:31.300 --> 19:32.432
Hey.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.868
Hey!

19:33.911 --> 19:35.696
This is nobody's fault.
We're a team.

19:35.739 --> 19:36.827
We stick together.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.527
Sit down.

19:45.445 --> 19:47.838
Bruno Venturi,
first-round soccer draft pick

19:47.882 --> 19:49.188
and said to be a star.

19:49.231 --> 19:51.842
But then his stats tumbled.

19:51.886 --> 19:54.280
Sports articles trashed him.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.325
Soccer social media
started to harass him.

19:56.369 --> 19:59.110
Is that why he changed his
name and got out of the game?

20:01.417 --> 20:03.419
Wait a second. Gord McDougall.

20:03.463 --> 20:04.942
Who's Gord McDougall?

20:04.986 --> 20:07.162
It can't be a coincidence.

20:07.206 --> 20:08.250
What? What?

20:08.294 --> 20:09.469
Gord McDougall has

20:09.512 --> 20:10.750
one of the best win/loss records

20:10.774 --> 20:12.863
of any Canadian soccer coach
in history.

20:12.907 --> 20:15.170
He's on the flight
with three of his players,

20:15.214 --> 20:17.694
and he was Bruno's old coach.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.566
I got it.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.613
What's going on?

20:24.614 --> 20:27.356
The copilot is Bruno Venturi.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.230
He's flying the plane? Bruno?

20:31.273 --> 20:33.275
Yes. You didn't recognize him?

20:33.319 --> 20:35.799
N-No. I... I haven't seen him
in a dozen years.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.801
He was, like, 16
last time I saw him.

20:37.845 --> 20:38.976
And you cut him?

20:39.020 --> 20:40.543
Yeah.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.242
But I fought to keep him.
He knows that.

20:43.285 --> 20:44.721
But Bruno being cut
from the team

20:44.765 --> 20:46.027
and now seeing the uniforms...

20:46.070 --> 20:47.246
Let me talk to him.

20:47.289 --> 20:49.596
Look, despite how it
ended, Bruno and I,

20:49.639 --> 20:50.901
we share an unbreakable bond.

20:50.945 --> 20:52.575
I wasn't just his coach,
I was his mentor,

20:52.599 --> 20:53.556
his teacher.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.210
I can get that door open

20:55.254 --> 20:57.168
a lot faster than
that negotiator up there,

20:57.212 --> 20:59.301
that's for sure.

20:59.345 --> 21:00.626
Why'd you change
your name, Bruno?

21:00.650 --> 21:01.869
I didn't.

21:01.912 --> 21:03.697
There's a passport
in your apartment.

21:03.740 --> 21:06.308
And you never even told Fiona
you played soccer.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.396
She had no idea.

21:07.440 --> 21:09.137
I never played soccer.

21:10.878 --> 21:12.401
Bruno, I'll be right back.

21:12.445 --> 21:14.621
I'm not going anywhere.

21:14.664 --> 21:16.449
His coach wants
to speak with him.

21:16.492 --> 21:18.407
I agree.

21:18.451 --> 21:20.888
But we're running out
of time and strategies.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.281
All right.

21:22.324 --> 21:24.631
Bruno is denying
he ever even played soccer.

21:24.674 --> 21:27.024
You can't say anything
that might provoke his anger.

21:27.068 --> 21:29.046
No problem. I know what to say.
Okay, w-what's that?

21:29.070 --> 21:30.550
Just watch me.

21:30.593 --> 21:33.683
Listen, I hear
anything I don't like,

21:33.727 --> 21:35.555
I'm gonna end the conversation.

21:35.598 --> 21:37.992
So you know.

21:38.035 --> 21:40.255
Yeah.

21:43.693 --> 21:44.955
Bruno.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.610
Hi. It's Coach McDougall.

21:47.654 --> 21:51.658
I miss you, buddy.

21:51.701 --> 21:54.922
Hey, you know, I still remember
that game against Costa Rica.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.576
You got the rebound
off the crossbar,

21:56.619 --> 21:58.099
headed it into the corner.

21:58.142 --> 22:00.449
Man, that was
a beautiful finish.

22:03.844 --> 22:06.629
Listen, Bruno, I understand
what it must be like

22:06.673 --> 22:09.632
seeing those guys
get on the plane, but...

22:09.676 --> 22:12.156
you got to understand,

22:12.200 --> 22:16.378
not everybody can succeed in
the game, and-and that's okay.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.338
I mean, you're a pilot.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.949
The point is to succeed at life,

22:21.992 --> 22:23.864
and clearly, Bruno,
you've done that.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.431
Now land the plane,

22:25.474 --> 22:26.562
and then we'll talk.

22:26.606 --> 22:28.085
Whatever you need, man, you...

22:28.129 --> 22:30.305
Hey, check it out. It's a fighter.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.264
They gonna shoot us down?

22:33.308 --> 22:34.396
Look out the window.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.398
No, they're here to help us.

22:36.442 --> 22:40.054
There's a second
fighter on the starboard side.

22:40.097 --> 22:41.447
They're gonna provoke him.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.318
This is NORAD Defense Systems.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.667
Please respond with your status

22:44.711 --> 22:47.540
or we will be forced
to take defensive action.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.629
Is he dumping our fuel?

22:51.848 --> 22:53.826
If he doesn't switch it off,
we won't have enough fuel

22:53.850 --> 22:56.505
to land the plane anywhere.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.547
Colonel, we can't negotiate
under the barrel of a gun.

23:18.571 --> 23:20.375
You got to get those
fighter jets away from us.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.575
We cannot allow your plane
to be turned into a weapon.

23:22.618 --> 23:24.794
We're still 30 minutes
from Denver.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.101
Sorry, these orders
come straight from the top.

23:27.144 --> 23:29.538
With all due respect, Colonel,
you're full of crap.

23:29.582 --> 23:30.907
The White House
wouldn't order a shoot down

23:30.931 --> 23:32.541
until the last second.

23:32.585 --> 23:35.152
Your orders are to tag and tail,
but you're following too close.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.198
You're gonna provoke
the copilot into crashing.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.722
How's that gonna affect
your career, Colonel?

23:39.766 --> 23:42.856
I'll pull them back three miles.
That's the best I can do.

23:42.899 --> 23:44.379
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.989
Well played.Yeah.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.873
"Cover your butt"
always works in the military.

23:54.084 --> 23:56.217
Even if we get close
to downtown, they're gonna

23:56.260 --> 23:57.566
execute the shoot order.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.742
We have to get Bruno
heading away from Denver.

23:59.786 --> 24:02.963
If he doesn't turn off that
fuel dump, that won't matter.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.444
Take a look, Bruno.
The F-16s are backing off.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.446
Can we talk now?

24:09.622 --> 24:11.580
Come on, Bruno.
I'm doing everything I can.

24:11.624 --> 24:14.104
You got to,
you got to meet me halfway.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.194
Hey, guys.

24:17.238 --> 24:20.371
Um, Chris and the boys
have been acting kind of weird.

24:20.415 --> 24:22.112
I think there's
something going on.

24:22.156 --> 24:24.114
What do you mean?

24:28.379 --> 24:29.859
Are we on comms?

24:29.903 --> 24:31.426
Loud and clear.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.168
We need to talk. Privately.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.867
Can we talk? Yes.

24:37.911 --> 24:40.479
Please, have a seat.

24:51.402 --> 24:53.709
Hey.

24:53.753 --> 24:56.320
Listen, my name is Eric, okay?

24:56.364 --> 25:00.803
Chris, you have to tell me what
really happened last night.

25:00.847 --> 25:02.805
It might be the difference

25:02.849 --> 25:06.026
between this plane
landing or crashing.

25:06.069 --> 25:08.463
Evie, can you give us five?

25:08.507 --> 25:10.421
Yeah.

25:15.688 --> 25:17.646
This is
just like Bruno's behavior

25:17.690 --> 25:19.953
back in the day. He was,
he was always very impulsive.

25:19.996 --> 25:23.391
You seemed very moved
when you were talking to him.

25:23.434 --> 25:26.525
Of course I was moved.
I love these guys.

25:26.568 --> 25:28.788
And I know that I can
get him to open that door.

25:28.831 --> 25:31.051
You got to give me
another chance.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.314
Okay, Cynthia, I think
I got what you're looking for.

25:33.357 --> 25:35.185
A series of legal
settlements and NDAs

25:35.229 --> 25:36.665
all associated with the team,

25:36.709 --> 25:40.495
Coach Gord McDougall.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.149
Maybe.

25:42.192 --> 25:44.344
But first can you tell me about
the nondisclosure agreements?

25:44.368 --> 25:47.241
I'm sorry.

25:47.284 --> 25:48.610
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.201
NDA dated July 12, 2008.

25:51.245 --> 25:52.507
A second one dated.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.727
May 29, 2010.May 29, 2010.

25:54.770 --> 25:57.033
July 12, 2008.

25:57.077 --> 25:59.340
What's going on, Coach?

25:59.383 --> 26:01.037
What did you do? Nothing.

26:01.081 --> 26:03.126
Then what's in those agreements?

26:03.170 --> 26:05.476
What can't you talk about?

26:05.520 --> 26:07.348
Physical abuse?

26:07.391 --> 26:09.263
Verbal abuse?

26:09.306 --> 26:11.047
Steroids? Okay, look.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.920
These are kids. You know, we
have to protect their privacy.

26:13.963 --> 26:17.097
I was drinking last night.

26:18.664 --> 26:21.580
But...

26:21.623 --> 26:23.625
it wasn't 'cause we won.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.544
Coach, he...

26:29.588 --> 26:32.982
he called me
into his hotel room,

26:33.026 --> 26:36.551
like... like he always does.

26:41.382 --> 26:43.602
You really want to hear this?

26:43.645 --> 26:46.779
Yeah, I need to...
I need to know the truth.

26:46.822 --> 26:49.651
I couldn't take it anymore.

26:51.697 --> 26:56.223
I went out on my balcony and...

26:56.266 --> 26:58.268
I-I thought about jumping.

26:58.312 --> 27:02.533
But then Liam and Sean,
they-they came and...

27:02.577 --> 27:04.100
They-they stopped you.

27:07.669 --> 27:10.672
If I say anything,
no one will believe me.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.806
I-If they say anything,
they'll get kicked off the team.

27:15.808 --> 27:18.027
When you've got
a record like Coach's,

27:18.071 --> 27:19.899
no one wants to hear
about that stuff.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.684
You weren't just
Bruno's coach, were you?

27:22.728 --> 27:24.033
You did other things with him.

27:24.077 --> 27:26.340
You got some nerve... And
when he tried to speak,

27:26.383 --> 27:28.211
you got rid of him. You are way off base.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.039
Let me talk to him. He is dumping fuel.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.694
We don't land
unless you confess.

27:32.738 --> 27:36.437
And then maybe,
maybe we all live.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.614
Well, I'll be at
the front waiting. Think.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.140
Hey, I've been analyzing
Bruno's flight path

27:44.184 --> 27:45.664
with the guy at the FAA.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.230
He isn't headed
for downtown Denver.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.668
His vector takes him straight
towards Dunvegan College,

27:49.711 --> 27:52.018
30 miles southwest of the city.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.715
That's the Nabilio scandal.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.586
Remind me.

27:55.630 --> 27:57.414
Dunvegan was
the sight of a major

27:57.458 --> 27:58.764
football sex abuse scandal.

27:58.807 --> 28:00.809
Lance Nabilio was the head
coach who covered it up.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.178
That's where Bruno's
crashing the plane.

28:02.202 --> 28:03.420
He's making a statement.

28:03.464 --> 28:05.727
But there's a problem, Eric.

28:05.771 --> 28:08.164
If he's dumping fuel,
the plane's not gonna make it.

28:08.208 --> 28:09.426
Bruno.

28:09.470 --> 28:12.778
Dunvegan College, right?

28:12.821 --> 28:14.170
Small problem.

28:14.214 --> 28:16.216
Check your fuel gauge.

28:16.259 --> 28:18.479
There's not enough fuel,
is there?

28:18.522 --> 28:20.655
It's a bold statement, Bruno.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.178
I understand it,
and what's more...

28:22.222 --> 28:25.094
I want to help, so let me.

28:27.096 --> 28:28.619
There is a young man here.

28:28.663 --> 28:32.711
His name is Chris. He's 17.

28:32.754 --> 28:35.409
He wants to talk.

28:37.977 --> 28:40.066
Hold down the button.

28:42.111 --> 28:45.941
Hi. I'm-I'm Chris.

28:45.985 --> 28:49.336
I-I'm a striker with Montreal.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.730
Eric says you used
to play for us.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.864
Keep going.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.475
Look, the coach...

28:58.519 --> 29:00.608
same thing happened to me
that happened to you.

29:00.651 --> 29:04.525
For me, it started
three weeks in.

29:04.568 --> 29:07.702
I-I don't know why
he picked me, but...

29:07.746 --> 29:10.139
but he did.

29:15.144 --> 29:17.756
I'm sorry, Chris.

29:19.888 --> 29:22.978
You can save Chris's future
and bring Coach McDougall

29:23.022 --> 29:26.677
to justice, but first you have
to turn off the fuel dump.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.817
Okay.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.699
That's great, Bruno.

29:48.743 --> 29:50.745
Now let's talk about
finding a runway.

29:50.789 --> 29:52.791
Sure.

30:06.456 --> 30:08.260
Okay. No, there's no way
you're talking to him.

30:08.284 --> 30:09.740
I know him.
I know how to talk to him.

30:09.764 --> 30:11.046
No, he's agreed
to land the plane.

30:11.070 --> 30:12.854
Come on, Bruno.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.769
You know how much
you meant to me.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.423
Don't you remember
how connected we were,

30:16.466 --> 30:17.380
how many great times

30:17.424 --> 30:19.426
we had together? Okay, Coach...

30:19.469 --> 30:21.297
Open that... Open the...

30:21.341 --> 30:23.386
Get off me! Get off!

30:24.910 --> 30:28.304
You're finished. All of you.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.916
You'll never play soccer again.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.835
Bruno, it's over.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.401
Chris has come forward.

30:38.445 --> 30:40.099
His teammates have taken
the coach away.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.188
It doesn't matter!

30:42.231 --> 30:44.886
Arresting the coach
won't make a difference.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.366
It's everywhere.

30:46.409 --> 30:49.543
Chris is part of the problem.
I'm part of the problem.

30:49.586 --> 30:51.240
It needs to stop now.

30:52.807 --> 30:55.854
Danger. Danger. Danger.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.335
Eric.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.991
He's going to crash
into the Rockies.

31:03.035 --> 31:05.994
Danger. Danger.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.343
Danger.

31:07.387 --> 31:10.390
Danger. Danger.

31:10.433 --> 31:11.913
Danger.

31:11.957 --> 31:14.133
Danger. Danger.

31:14.176 --> 31:15.917
What's happening?

31:16.962 --> 31:18.964
He just purged the oxygen.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.967
How much air do we have?12
minutes before we run out.

31:22.010 --> 31:25.144
And if he doesn't repressurize
the cabin, what happens?

31:25.187 --> 31:27.146
We're dead.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.463
No, I got it. Get yours.

31:40.507 --> 31:42.552
All right, all right.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.912
Did you call your mom? I
couldn't get through.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.571
You know, we went
hiking once near Oka.

32:03.530 --> 32:05.271
You disappeared.

32:05.314 --> 32:08.274
You were missing for,
like, 45 minutes.

32:08.317 --> 32:12.887
When the park rangers found you,

32:12.931 --> 32:14.671
you had already
gathered berries to eat.

32:14.715 --> 32:17.283
You found this little shelter
under a fallen tree.

32:17.326 --> 32:19.067
And you were singing.

32:19.111 --> 32:20.590
To keep the witches away.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.636
That's right. That's right.

32:24.638 --> 32:27.684
I was in awe.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.686
I still am.

32:31.210 --> 32:33.777
We tried everything
we could. Nothing worked.

32:33.821 --> 32:37.259
We're gonna run out
of oxygen soon.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.044
Okay, you guys, hang in there.

32:39.087 --> 32:40.436
This is not over.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.352
Can you be more specific?
'Cause that might help.

32:46.747 --> 32:48.618
Dad?

32:51.360 --> 32:54.276
Yeah.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.800
Why did you push me away?

33:01.892 --> 33:03.851
I thought if I kept my distance,

33:03.894 --> 33:06.375
it would keep you safe.

33:08.377 --> 33:10.727
It felt like you abandoned me.

33:10.771 --> 33:12.294
No.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.210
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.389
I wish I could've
been a better dad.

33:20.433 --> 33:22.391
You were a better dad.

33:25.438 --> 33:28.354
This will give
you ten minutes more

33:28.397 --> 33:30.269
than the rest of us.

33:30.312 --> 33:32.923
You're our only chance.

33:32.967 --> 33:35.274
Try again. Please.

33:41.410 --> 33:45.371
I'm staying with you
till the end, okay?

33:45.414 --> 33:49.288
You can't protect me
from everything, Dad.

33:49.331 --> 33:51.551
Go do your job.

33:56.251 --> 34:00.081
I love you so much, Evie.

34:00.125 --> 34:04.607
You are the most important
thing in my life.

34:04.651 --> 34:07.045
And you always will be.

34:09.090 --> 34:10.570
You always will be.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.542
Isn't there anyone
you want to call?

34:31.851 --> 34:34.811
Eric.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.509
Yeah?

34:36.552 --> 34:40.252
Eric, thank you for everything.

34:40.295 --> 34:42.514
Guys...

34:44.603 --> 34:46.606
it ain't over yet.

35:10.847 --> 35:14.329
It's just you and me now, Bruno.

35:20.509 --> 35:23.991
Neither one of us
wants to die alone.

35:24.034 --> 35:26.385
Why not open the door?

36:30.536 --> 36:33.365
Wow.

36:33.408 --> 36:34.801
That's some view.

36:58.955 --> 37:00.957
Munchers?

37:07.747 --> 37:11.098
Something you said before
has been eating at me.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.883
You said,
"I'm part of the problem."

37:13.927 --> 37:16.973
What did you mean by that?

37:17.017 --> 37:18.410
Nothing.

37:18.453 --> 37:21.500
Nothing?

37:21.543 --> 37:23.545
I know this isn't
about vengeance.

37:23.589 --> 37:25.939
You wouldn't kill a plane
full of people for that.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.723
There's something else going on.

37:27.767 --> 37:31.945
What if you've become
the thing you fear the most?

37:31.988 --> 37:36.558
What if the abused
becomes the abuser?

37:36.602 --> 37:38.952
That's why you shied away
from Fiona when she tried

37:38.995 --> 37:42.347
to bring her son
into your life, isn't it?

37:42.390 --> 37:45.350
Why you think you need
to kill yourself.

37:45.393 --> 37:48.440
And the other players
and the coach.

37:48.483 --> 37:51.356
You don't know how else to end
this terrible cycle of abuse,

37:51.399 --> 37:52.748
do you?

37:52.792 --> 37:54.794
The thing about PTSS

37:54.837 --> 37:59.581
is that sometimes it gives rise
to unwanted thoughts.

37:59.625 --> 38:03.063
But thoughts are not
the same as urges.

38:03.106 --> 38:06.632
Have you ever acted
on your thoughts, Bruno?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.506
No.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.813
Of course not.

38:13.856 --> 38:17.860
Coach McDougall had urges,
and he acted on them,

38:17.904 --> 38:19.862
with complete disregard
for his victims.

38:19.906 --> 38:21.603
On the other hand,
I mean, you could've

38:21.647 --> 38:24.650
taken this plane into a nosedive
at any point, but you didn't.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.652
You purged the oxygen

38:26.695 --> 38:29.045
so that the passengers
fell asleep peacefully.

38:29.089 --> 38:31.265
You did that out of compassion.

38:31.309 --> 38:34.529
You and the coach
are not the same,

38:34.573 --> 38:35.748
and you never will be, okay?

38:35.791 --> 38:37.663
You don't know who I am.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.621
Maybe not.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.711
But Fiona does know.

38:42.755 --> 38:44.539
Caution. Terrain.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.934
Go ahead, Fiona.

38:47.977 --> 38:51.067
Bruno? Babe?

38:51.111 --> 38:53.374
Caution. Terrain.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.941
Fiona.

38:54.984 --> 38:58.597
I-I heard everything.
Why didn't you tell me?

38:58.640 --> 39:00.903
I love you.

39:00.947 --> 39:03.123
I'll be there for you.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.777
Caution. Terrain.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.169
We'll be there for you.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.258
This won't keep us
away from you.

39:08.302 --> 39:09.912
Caution. Terrain.

39:09.956 --> 39:11.566
Bruno.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.829
She heard the truth,
and she didn't push you away.

39:13.873 --> 39:16.745
You tell the world,
and they will listen.

39:16.789 --> 39:19.400
Nobody listened 12 years ago.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.533
Yeah, because
Coach McDougall used his power

39:21.576 --> 39:23.404
to shut you up.

39:23.448 --> 39:24.884
Silence was
his weapon of choice,

39:24.927 --> 39:27.713
but there is nothing more silent
than smoldering wreckage

39:27.756 --> 39:29.976
and dead bodies on the
summit of a mountain.

39:30.019 --> 39:31.586
If you crash this plane,
Coach wins.

39:31.630 --> 39:32.631
You understand that?

39:36.069 --> 39:39.768
The only way to stop the cycle
is to speak up.

39:39.812 --> 39:41.030
Bruno!

39:42.031 --> 39:43.032
Bruno, please!

39:43.076 --> 39:44.338
End the silence.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.905
Danger. Pull up.

39:45.948 --> 39:48.429
Danger. Pull up.

39:48.473 --> 39:49.778
Danger. Pull up.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.867
Danger. Pull up.
Danger. Pull up.

40:22.681 --> 40:25.640
Air traffic control,
this is Cartier Flight 617

40:25.684 --> 40:27.816
requesting emergency landing.

40:27.860 --> 40:29.992
We'll need emergency vehicles
on the ground.

40:31.820 --> 40:33.909
And oxygen, if you don't mind.

40:51.971 --> 40:54.930
Coach is being held by the FBI.

40:54.974 --> 40:56.845
And what about Bruno?

40:56.889 --> 40:58.847
I called a criminal
lawyer I know in Denver,

40:58.891 --> 41:01.154
and he's agreed to
represent Bruno pro bono.

41:01.197 --> 41:03.156
So his story will be heard.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.941
That's great news. Amazing.

41:05.985 --> 41:08.161
Bruno's gonna need
some counseling.

41:08.204 --> 41:10.729
We'll see what we can do
about that.

41:10.772 --> 41:14.341
Okay, let's call it a day.

41:14.384 --> 41:15.690
Okay. Later.

41:15.734 --> 41:17.736
Bye.

41:26.092 --> 41:27.963
All right, all right, all right.

41:35.841 --> 41:37.669
Thank you. You saved us all.

41:37.712 --> 41:40.367
Okay.

41:40.410 --> 41:41.716
She's exaggerating.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.723
Evie, I don't know what
you remember from the plane,

41:48.767 --> 41:50.682
but these past few months,
I've been keeping you

41:50.725 --> 41:52.355
at a distance because I
thought it would be...

41:52.379 --> 41:54.381
It's okay, Dad.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.905
I won't let anyone
get between us anymore.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.690
From now on,

41:58.733 --> 42:00.822
together, okay?-

42:00.866 --> 42:03.085
Cool.

42:03.129 --> 42:06.088
I'll still never fly
with you again, though.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.916
Your mother will see to that.

42:12.878 --> 42:14.575
Maybe I should...

42:14.619 --> 42:17.186
Yeah. Go.

42:17.230 --> 42:19.319
And say thanks.

42:28.023 --> 42:29.416
You okay?

42:29.459 --> 42:31.461
Good.

42:33.246 --> 42:35.248
We were gonna die today.

42:37.337 --> 42:39.644
And there wasn't anyone
you wanted to call.

42:39.687 --> 42:43.517
That's a story for another day.
