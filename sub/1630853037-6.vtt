WEBVTT

00:03.545 --> 00:06.840
(chair scraping on floor)

00:18.268 --> 00:20.437
I am the Tallyman,

00:20.478 --> 00:23.940
but I am not the villain.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.067
I'm your wakeup call.

00:27.527 --> 00:31.865
You believed
the Charmed Ones were your...

00:31.906 --> 00:34.576
saviors, your protectors,

00:34.617 --> 00:36.953
but you were wrong.

00:38.246 --> 00:42.667
Look how easy it was
to show you the truth.

00:42.709 --> 00:46.046
They haven't even come close
to stopping me.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.132
And for months,

00:49.174 --> 00:51.509
they didn't even try.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.762
And I'm not the first.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.514
Remember the Source of All Evil,

00:56.556 --> 00:58.808
the Faction?

00:58.850 --> 01:02.312
Tomb of Chaos ring a bell?

01:02.353 --> 01:04.773
With every one
of their mistakes,

01:04.814 --> 01:06.941
guess who pays the price.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.569
You do. You do.

01:11.321 --> 01:13.281
Aren't you tired

01:13.323 --> 01:17.827
of those three Chosen Ones
taking your loyalty for granted?

01:17.869 --> 01:21.998
Choosing humans over us?

01:23.958 --> 01:26.086
(sighs)

01:28.880 --> 01:33.093
The good news is,
help is on the way.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.972
And, well...

01:38.014 --> 01:40.225
it's gonna be a doozy.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.653
(Ghanaian music playing)

01:51.694 --> 01:55.698
Think these slices
are thick enough?

01:55.740 --> 01:57.867
I don't even know how
to pronounce what we're making.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.536
Chi boom?

01:59.577 --> 02:02.330
Chee-boom.
Che-bum.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.750
Ah, the vegetables are supposed
to be chopped, not abused.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.335
I'm-I'm sorry.

02:09.045 --> 02:11.506
I just can't stop thinking

02:11.548 --> 02:14.008
about that guy's ranting
at the Blue Camellia.

02:14.050 --> 02:17.053
That goblin goober is about
to blow up the bar, but yet,

02:17.095 --> 02:18.805
we're the bad guys?

02:18.847 --> 02:21.182
I think that's good.

02:21.224 --> 02:23.017
Look, I'm not defending
Donnie Darko,

02:23.059 --> 02:25.103
but his behavior is classic
psychological deflection.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.814
I mean, he can't handle the
mistakes he's made in his life,

02:27.856 --> 02:30.024
so he uses us as scapegoats.

02:30.066 --> 02:33.194
And we're easy targets, because
of the Tallyman's propaganda.

02:33.236 --> 02:34.654
The problem is

02:34.696 --> 02:36.156
is that some people
are starting to believe it.

02:36.197 --> 02:38.783
I know, and we'll get him,
but right now,

02:38.825 --> 02:40.451
we need to make sure
Kaela doesn't disappear

02:40.493 --> 02:42.162
into the night again
now that she knows

02:42.203 --> 02:44.080
we're not actually related.

02:44.122 --> 02:48.918
So, happy faces,
favorite breakfast,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.628
no drama.
Mm.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.631
(music playing over headphones)

02:56.801 --> 02:58.803
Wait.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.305
Are y'all making chibom?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.348
Trying? (laughs)
Wait.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.434
You did all this for me?

03:04.475 --> 03:06.978
Mm. That's really sweet.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.396
Thanks.
So,

03:08.438 --> 03:09.689
you're okay?

03:09.731 --> 03:11.232
Yeah. No, I'm good.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.234
I mean, seeing those two randos

03:13.276 --> 03:16.404
in the Filiation Frame was
a bit of a needle scratch,

03:16.446 --> 03:18.448
but it's not the end
of the world.

03:18.489 --> 03:20.658
But we some
badass witches. (chuckles)

03:20.700 --> 03:22.911
We're gonna figure out
who they are.

03:24.662 --> 03:27.582
Well, I'm so glad you said that,

03:27.624 --> 03:30.084
because there might be another
way for you to find them.

03:30.126 --> 03:32.212
What?
Another spell.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.379
We would just need something

03:33.421 --> 03:35.006
from before you were adopted,

03:35.048 --> 03:37.300
like a toy
or a piece of clothing.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.219
I'll talk to my mom.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.263
(doorbell rings)

03:42.305 --> 03:44.641
We expecting anyone?
No.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.269
KAELA: Someone drops it
on the porch and splits?

03:48.311 --> 03:49.854
MEL: From the looks
of that spider,

03:49.896 --> 03:51.773
it's got to be
from the Tallyman.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.025
Okay, so, so what are we
supposed to do? Just

03:54.067 --> 03:56.402
leave it in this containment
spell forever?

03:56.444 --> 03:57.904
MEL:
We have to be careful.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.447
What if it's rigged to blow?
MAGGIE: Yeah.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.407
Or mechanical spiders jump out
and attack us?

04:01.449 --> 04:02.700
(sighs)

04:04.619 --> 04:08.665
Any chance you can get
a vision from it?

04:08.706 --> 04:11.793
Figure out what's inside?

04:13.127 --> 04:16.381
I ha-haven't had one since...

04:16.422 --> 04:18.800
Macy.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.843
I'll try.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.525
I can't even conjure that warm,
familiar feeling anymore.

04:36.734 --> 04:39.112
(alarm chimes on phone)

04:42.365 --> 04:44.993
What's that?
Nothing.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.412
That was the reminder for your
anger management, wasn't it?

04:47.453 --> 04:49.414
No.
Maggie!

04:49.455 --> 04:54.043
Okay, fine. I'm not going
to abandon you two.

04:54.085 --> 04:55.920
Not when...
No. You blow this off,

04:55.962 --> 04:57.714
and the court revokes
your plea deal.

04:57.755 --> 05:00.008
Unless you want to be
the only witch on Cell Block D.

05:00.049 --> 05:02.010
Yeah, we got this, boo.
We need you healthy,

05:02.051 --> 05:03.594
and we need you out of the shoe.

05:03.636 --> 05:05.805
(sighs)

05:05.847 --> 05:08.224
Fine. But if things heat up,

05:08.266 --> 05:11.519
text me,
or I'm gonna be so pissed.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.861
Anger management.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.534
Can I help you?

05:26.576 --> 05:27.994
Roxie would like
to see you.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.164
So she sent you two?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.251
Unbelievable.

05:35.293 --> 05:38.671
Can I at least, uh,
finish my coffee?

05:42.759 --> 05:44.510
Okeydokey.

05:47.263 --> 05:50.516
Oh, hey, hey, hey, come on.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.018
Not here.

05:52.935 --> 05:54.020
Come on, guys.

06:00.902 --> 06:02.904
(knocking)

06:02.945 --> 06:04.906
Your guys said
you wanted to see...

06:04.947 --> 06:07.075
Harry. Harry?!

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
Oh.

06:12.038 --> 06:13.164
What happened to him?

06:13.206 --> 06:14.665
Nothing you can't heal.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.003
(panting)

06:21.839 --> 06:23.800
Normally, I can...

06:23.841 --> 06:26.302
I can feel the energy
of whoever I'm healing, but...

06:26.344 --> 06:28.471
oh, his is so faint.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.681
Well, he has been
to hell and back, literally.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.308
I'm gonna fix my friend,

06:32.350 --> 06:35.645
but after I do,
you're gonna tell me everything.

06:37.355 --> 06:39.440
(panting)

06:41.984 --> 06:43.945
Hey, Mr. Borden.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.948
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was crazy.

06:46.989 --> 06:49.200
MAN:
They say being late is
a form of aggression,

06:49.242 --> 06:51.077
albeit passive.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.453
Dad?

06:52.495 --> 06:55.039
Little Bug.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.249
(laughs)

06:56.290 --> 06:58.376
Hi.
Hey.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.462
Hey, how did you know
I'd be here?

07:01.504 --> 07:03.047
Did you talk to Mel?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.550
No, I have not had time
to see my Torito, no.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.885
But she's the only one who...
Hmm.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.555
Explain.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.182
ChooChi-- he's been
keeping an eye on you

07:13.224 --> 07:14.600
and Mel since Macy passed.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.644
You mean spying on us.
Ah, tomayto-tomahto.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.313
Dad!
I'm sorry, I was worried.

07:19.355 --> 07:20.982
Can you blame me?

07:21.023 --> 07:24.193
For invading our
privacy? Yeah, Dad.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.862
We can handle ourselves.

07:25.903 --> 07:28.948
Well, sure, when it comes
to magic, but, you know,

07:28.990 --> 07:32.785
it's the everyday life stuff
that can get to you. Huh?

07:32.827 --> 07:36.622
Flat tires or debt or...

07:36.664 --> 07:40.168
smashing a guy's face in
on a crowded public street.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.676
Admittedly, not my finest hour.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.096
ChooChi pulled some strings
with your counselor.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.475
Apparently, they have
a mutual friend on the force.

07:55.516 --> 07:59.479
They let me come
as an intervention.

08:00.438 --> 08:02.523
Oh.

08:03.774 --> 08:06.402
Honestly, Dad, I'm fine.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.987
I know what
I did was...

08:08.029 --> 08:10.114
completely unacceptable,

08:10.156 --> 08:12.408
and it will never happen again.

08:12.450 --> 08:13.910
So just

08:13.951 --> 08:17.038
tell them that
this intervention was a success,

08:17.079 --> 08:19.207
'cause I really...
I really should be going.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.667
Oh, hey, you're not
going anywhere.
What are you doing?

08:21.709 --> 08:24.212
Not until we talk.
Just... (groans)

08:24.253 --> 08:28.007
Seriously, Dad? Faking
a heart attack's not gonna work.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.675
Oh.
Dad!

08:29.717 --> 08:32.887
(gasps) Dad?
(groans)

08:32.929 --> 08:33.971
Dad?

08:34.013 --> 08:36.766
It was that bartender-- Sunny.

08:36.807 --> 08:39.477
She managed to escape while
we were interrogating her,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.604
got me with one of
her poisonous claws.

08:41.646 --> 08:45.775
Interrogations? Does this mean
you're working for Roxie now?

08:45.816 --> 08:47.902
No one's working
for anyone.

08:47.944 --> 08:51.155
We just happen to share...
common interests.

08:51.197 --> 08:52.698
JORDAN:
Hmm.

08:52.740 --> 08:54.367
And how exactly is it
in your interest

08:54.408 --> 08:56.619
to rot from the inside out?

08:56.661 --> 08:59.038
I was hoping
to get a lead on the Tallyman.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.458
Did you?
Sunny escaped before we
could get anything out of her.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.669
And what about Donnie?
Well...

09:06.837 --> 09:09.257
He's proving difficult to crack.

09:09.298 --> 09:11.300
Uh-huh.
Maybe I can help.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.762
I know it sounds strange, but
the guy kind of opened up to me.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.014
I don't think
that's a good idea.
Look,

09:17.056 --> 09:19.058
I know the dude went off
the deep end, but he told me

09:19.100 --> 09:20.643
he still had a soft spot
for his wife,

09:20.685 --> 09:23.396
so, maybe she knows something.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.569
I still have Donnie's wallet.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.947
His address
is in there.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
See what you
can find out.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.827
Mind if I come with?

09:37.868 --> 09:40.288
Or do I need
to ask her permission now?

09:40.329 --> 09:43.040
Lead the way.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.176
(sighs)
KAELA:
So what is this? Like,

09:54.218 --> 09:56.220
a see-through-stuff
kind of spell?
Yeah.

09:56.262 --> 09:57.888
It's basically a version
of an X-ray machine

09:57.930 --> 10:00.308
when you don't have
an X-ray machine handy.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.772
Mm.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.400
Mystical glow,
grant me sight,

10:09.442 --> 10:12.486
show me what's hidden
under the light.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.658
What is it?
Looks like

10:17.700 --> 10:18.951
a box of some kind.

10:18.993 --> 10:20.453
Doesn't look like

10:20.494 --> 10:22.580
there are explosives
or dark magic. I think

10:22.622 --> 10:23.914
we're good to go.
Let's do it.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.626
(sighs)

10:26.667 --> 10:27.793
Okay.

10:27.835 --> 10:30.212
Dimitte ex carcere.

10:44.727 --> 10:48.105
"You've failed to save lives,
but try not to worry.

10:48.147 --> 10:50.775
You have one more chance,
that is, if you hurry."

10:50.816 --> 10:52.860
Another one of his cruel games.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.571
(sighs)

10:57.573 --> 11:00.493
"Help hundreds of innocents,
save the day.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.745
"Before the Tallyman
makes them pay.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.790
"The box sings a song,
sing back its tune,

11:05.831 --> 11:08.959
and the top will open
before they meet their doom."

11:09.001 --> 11:11.212
Did that say
"hundreds of innocents"?

11:23.557 --> 11:25.559
♪ Tallyman, Tallyman,
he keeps count ♪

11:25.601 --> 11:28.229
♪ Tallyman, Tallyman,
don't step out ♪

11:28.270 --> 11:31.357
♪ If you're good, then he pays ♪

11:31.399 --> 11:34.318
♪ If you're not,
then he slays. ♪

11:36.654 --> 11:38.280
Well, the guy's
a homicidal maniac.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.825
I guess he's not gonna
make it that easy.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.119
We don't have time to sing
every song on the planet.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.205
You know what? How about we just
save ourselves a lot of time

11:46.247 --> 11:48.082
and crack this sucker open?
Right.

11:48.124 --> 11:49.583
Because that went so well

11:49.625 --> 11:51.419
the last time
you broke a magical artifact.

11:52.336 --> 11:54.714
Well, the clock was an accident.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.049
Wait. That's it.
What's it?

11:57.091 --> 11:59.510
Ugh. No. No, no.
It's-it's a dumb idea.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.264
Okay, fine. Maybe I know
this guy at the Blue Camellia

12:03.305 --> 12:05.933
who can help, but it's just...
it's gonna be a whole thing.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.727
What kind of a thing?
Like,

12:07.768 --> 12:09.145
an annoyingly confident,

12:09.186 --> 12:10.563
surprisingly charismatic,
velvet-voiced,

12:10.604 --> 12:12.273
knows-he's-good-looking
kind of thing.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.775
Okay, well, this just got
a whole lot more interesting.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.736
Mel... (clicks tongue)

12:17.695 --> 12:20.030
(sighs)
Okay.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.829
(whooshing)

12:28.247 --> 12:31.041
Hmm.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.461
That's the melodious
thirst trap.

12:33.502 --> 12:36.422
MEL:
You have a thing
with Hot Singer Guy?

12:36.464 --> 12:39.467
There was... a connection.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.469
Like a lip connection?

12:41.510 --> 12:44.221
No, no,
but he's-he's got this thing

12:44.263 --> 12:47.391
with frequency and sounds,
and, um, he really helped me

12:47.433 --> 12:48.684
when you and Maggie went
to Ripples.

12:48.726 --> 12:51.270
So just please
don't embarrass me. Okay.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.147
Okay.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.648
Hey.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.567
Bar's closed,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.778
out of respect for, you know,
what happened with Donnie.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.738
And I've got a gig, so...
Okay, well,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.615
well, this will
only take a second.

13:02.656 --> 13:04.325
(yelling)

13:04.366 --> 13:06.410
Close it! Close the box!

13:06.452 --> 13:10.289
(gasps, panting)

13:10.331 --> 13:11.582
(groans)

13:11.624 --> 13:12.833
RAY:
What are you doing?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.294
Just helping you stay calm.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.506
Okay. That should help.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.050
I'm calling an ambulance.
Oh, no.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.052
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.553
Dad, you're having
a heart attack.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.055
It's not the time
to be Mr. Tough Guy.

13:26.096 --> 13:28.057
It's not a heart attack,
Little Bug.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.558
It's just angina.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.352
What's that?

13:31.393 --> 13:33.395
It's when the heart doesn't
get enough blood and oxygen.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.773
It's the beginnings
of coronary artery disease.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.525
Oh.

13:37.566 --> 13:38.984
Is that it?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.319
(clears throat)

13:40.361 --> 13:41.654
How long have you had this for?

13:41.695 --> 13:43.072
Well, I was diagnosed
four months ago,

13:43.113 --> 13:44.907
but the chest pains
really ramped up

13:44.949 --> 13:46.575
in the last couple
of weeks, you know,

13:46.617 --> 13:49.578
because of all the... stress.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.458
Why didn't you tell us?

13:54.500 --> 13:56.460
Ah.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.212
Saving the world's
a big enough burden for you

13:58.254 --> 14:00.214
to not have to worry
about your sick dad.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.341
You're not a burden, Dad.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.426
Okay, we got to get you
off meat, like, now,

14:04.468 --> 14:06.303
and into a good
exercise program.

14:06.345 --> 14:09.223
Oh. I was afraid
you were gonna say that.

14:10.391 --> 14:13.561
There's some pills in my bag.

14:20.025 --> 14:22.611
(chuckles softly)

14:22.653 --> 14:24.154
Is this... Trunksie?

14:24.196 --> 14:26.156
Hmm.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.784
It's one of the last things
I have left of your childhood.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.828
Maybe he could help
settle you.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.789
No.

14:33.831 --> 14:35.833
No!
Well...

14:35.875 --> 14:37.501
I'm not gonna do
a Trunksie session, Dad.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.087
Well, you'd be surprised
how cathartic it can be.

14:40.129 --> 14:42.047
Yeah, when I was, like, six.

14:42.089 --> 14:44.592
Can't just talk to a doll
to make it all better anymore.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.093
Come on, do it
for your dear old dad.

14:46.135 --> 14:47.803
Hmm?

14:47.845 --> 14:49.054
(high-pitched voice):
I'm Trunksie,

14:49.096 --> 14:54.018
and I'm all... ears.

14:54.059 --> 14:56.103
Just give it a shot.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.068
You still haven't told me where
you've been the last two weeks.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.779
Kaela's training's
a real wakeup call for me.

15:05.821 --> 15:09.074
I needed to get away so I could
choose a path forward.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.744
Did you?
I can't really
talk about it.

15:11.785 --> 15:14.455
Why? Does Roxie have
something over you?
No.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.498
This isn't about her.
Then what the hell is it?

15:16.540 --> 15:18.375
'Cause the Harry I know wouldn't
just disappear for two weeks.

15:18.417 --> 15:19.501
He would have called,
texted, something.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.086
I lost the love of my life.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.255
You have no idea
the kind of pain I feel.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.177
Maggie and I broke up.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.724
Oh, Jordan, I'm so sorry.

15:33.766 --> 15:37.436
I know you said you were getting
frustrated with the fighting,

15:37.478 --> 15:40.606
but I thought you'd find a way
to move past it.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.650
I tried, but it got worse, man.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.443
I couldn't keep enabling her.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.446
Then she goes out and beats
some random guy up in front

15:47.488 --> 15:49.490
of a bar, gets arrested,
and doesn't even call me.

15:49.531 --> 15:51.742
Arrested? Maggie? Is she okay?

15:51.784 --> 15:52.910
No.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.161
Are you okay?

15:54.203 --> 15:55.371
No, man, I'm not okay.

15:55.412 --> 15:56.789
And neither are you, obviously.

15:56.830 --> 15:59.041
Which is why we have
to talk to each other.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.835
They got their sisterhood, but
you and I-- we're a brotherhood.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.631
You're right.

16:05.673 --> 16:10.844
When this is all over, I swear,
I'll tell you everything.

16:10.886 --> 16:13.764
Right now, we need
to go see Donnie's wife.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.271
(rapid beeping, whooshing)

16:23.899 --> 16:25.818
I don't know what that thing is,

16:25.859 --> 16:27.820
but keep it the hell
away from me.

16:27.861 --> 16:30.906
Please! That psychotic
Tallyman terrorist

16:30.948 --> 16:33.534
is gonna hurt a lot of people
unless we crack this code,

16:33.575 --> 16:35.494
and we can't do it
without you.
You know,

16:35.536 --> 16:38.288
I used to think that the Charmed
Ones were these superheroes,

16:38.330 --> 16:40.749
that you could do
anything, beat anyone.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.292
But now, after what I've seen,

16:42.334 --> 16:44.003
I know you guys are just
a bunch of posers.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.963
What have you seen?
The Lamia, the Leprechaun,

16:46.005 --> 16:48.757
the spa. It's all out there.

16:48.799 --> 16:50.426
We are doing the best we can.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.760
Are you? Because when
there's a witch in trouble,

16:51.802 --> 16:53.262
it seems like
you can do no wrong.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.972
But when it comes to
the rest of us, you know,

16:55.014 --> 16:57.766
the lower class, you always
manage to drop the ball,

16:57.808 --> 17:00.102
as if you never gave a damn
about us in the first place.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.521
Oh, Dev, wait!
Good luck saving

17:02.563 --> 17:04.273
or not saving the world.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.909
Thank you.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.663
What I wouldn't give
to see him sitting there

17:19.705 --> 17:23.542
eating that damn cereal again.
(laughs, sniffles)

17:23.584 --> 17:25.419
Sounds like you two
have a very loving home.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.879
We did

17:26.920 --> 17:29.631
until he lost his job
at the spa

17:29.673 --> 17:33.218
and became
a completely different man.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.764
I watched him drift
further and further away

17:36.805 --> 17:39.933
because of those damn GemCast
videos people were posting.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.269
(laughs)

17:42.311 --> 17:44.104
Isn't it funny

17:44.146 --> 17:47.191
how one tragic event
can define your whole life?

17:47.232 --> 17:50.110
If you let it.

17:50.152 --> 17:54.031
Does Donnie ever talk about
someone called "the Tallyman"?

17:54.073 --> 17:55.949
Only to curse his name.

17:55.991 --> 17:59.286
He'd flip if he knew
people were talking about him

17:59.328 --> 18:01.789
in the same breath
as that terrorist.

18:01.830 --> 18:06.210
You met Donnie. You could tell

18:06.251 --> 18:08.420
he has a gentle soul, right?

18:10.380 --> 18:12.341
He seems lost,

18:12.382 --> 18:14.676
manipulated

18:14.718 --> 18:16.720
by someone who doesn't
give a damn about him.

18:16.762 --> 18:19.348
Now we can't clear his name

18:19.389 --> 18:22.267
unless we figure out
who that is.

18:25.312 --> 18:28.482
There's something
I need to show you.

18:49.086 --> 18:53.006
What the hell is "The Unseen"?

18:59.429 --> 19:01.598
(sighs)
MEL:
So, Dev--

19:01.640 --> 19:03.016
he's charming.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.518
Yeah, and different
from when we met.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.478
Something changed.

19:06.520 --> 19:09.565
It's those damn GemCasts videos
spitting out hideous propaganda

19:09.606 --> 19:11.692
created to turn
people against us.

19:11.733 --> 19:14.236
Yeah, well, all the more reason
to figure this out

19:14.278 --> 19:15.696
and stop the lies.

19:15.737 --> 19:17.865
Just...

19:17.906 --> 19:19.783
(high-pitched tone)

19:21.702 --> 19:23.120
(high-pitched tone returns)

19:23.162 --> 19:24.288
What?

19:24.329 --> 19:25.455
Dev's power.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.292
It lets him connect
to all kinds of frequencies.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.836
Hmm. So when he was in pain...
Pretty sure

19:30.878 --> 19:32.963
the box was sending out
a signal, just at a frequency

19:33.005 --> 19:34.047
that you and I can't hear.

19:34.089 --> 19:35.257
Like a dog whistle.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.509
That's apropos.
Yeah, okay.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.887
Dev's a dog, and I have
terrible taste in men.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.638
No, that's not what I meant.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.348
Yeah, I hear you're not
much better on the lady front.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.437
Ah. The Tongue of Babel.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.521
What?!

19:49.563 --> 19:51.815
When I had my Hot Girl Summer,

19:51.857 --> 19:53.859
a lot of the women
that I met didn't speak English

19:53.901 --> 19:56.778
or any human language.

19:56.820 --> 19:59.198
So I found a spell
that could translate

19:59.239 --> 20:01.200
anything, any word, any sound.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.534
Any frequency?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.328
Maybe.

20:06.330 --> 20:09.333
And this is why
you never, ever slut-shame.

20:11.084 --> 20:13.879
Why did you snap on that guy?

20:13.921 --> 20:16.006
I was angry.
Yes, but why?

20:16.048 --> 20:18.425
And don't say
it's because he was catcalling.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.594
You were angry way before
he even opened his mouth.

20:20.636 --> 20:22.471
Don't look at me,
look at Trunksie.

20:22.512 --> 20:24.598
(sighs)

20:26.850 --> 20:29.895
Jordan and I had just
had a fight.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.981
We basically broke up.

20:33.023 --> 20:35.400
So you're mad at Jordan?
No.

20:39.112 --> 20:41.448
(sighs)
He's not wrong.

20:41.490 --> 20:45.661
(sniffles)
I may have been fighting demons

20:45.702 --> 20:47.162
instead of dealing with my own.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.373
Grief is a frigging
ouroboros of emotion.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.874
So you're mad at Macy?

20:50.916 --> 20:53.335
No.

20:54.294 --> 20:57.714
I understand why
she did what she did.

20:57.756 --> 20:59.466
Then what are you mad at?

21:01.385 --> 21:03.345
I don't know.
No.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.931
You do know. You do know. You're
just not willing to go there.

21:05.973 --> 21:09.059
And if you don't, this anger--
it's gonna eat you alive, hon.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.686
It's already cost you
your boyfriend.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.646
It's cost you your humanity.
what's next, huh?

21:12.688 --> 21:15.899
Fine. You want to know
who I'm mad at?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.068
Who I really want
to punch in the face?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.488
Yes.
Me. I'm mad at myself.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.074
I should've known.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.118
Seeing the future--
it's kind of my thing.

21:26.159 --> 21:27.828
It's what makes me me.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.248
So I should've stopped her,
or at least warned her.

21:31.290 --> 21:36.211
But my visions failed,
and my magic failed. I failed.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.299
And Macy is dead because of it.

21:44.469 --> 21:47.681
BOTH:
Two tongues speak,
but neither can hear,

21:47.723 --> 21:51.601
create a tone unique,
and the confusion will clear.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.981
(notes chiming)

22:02.362 --> 22:04.906
(playing
"For He's a Jolly Good Fellow")

22:07.909 --> 22:09.911
♪ Which nobody can deny ♪

22:09.953 --> 22:12.914
BOTH:
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

22:12.956 --> 22:16.001
♪ For he's a jolly good fellow ♪

22:16.043 --> 22:19.212
♪ For he's a jolly
good fellow ♪

22:19.254 --> 22:22.341
♪ Which nobody can deny. ♪

22:24.968 --> 22:26.428
(gasps)
It worked.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.846
Yeah.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.098
Ah.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.352
Three tickets?

22:35.604 --> 22:38.815
There's an address on it
in Albuquerque.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.320
No way I'm going
to this unarmed.

22:43.362 --> 22:46.531
Good idea.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.747
Out of all the weapons
you could've chosen?

22:53.789 --> 22:55.957
I had, like, four seconds
to draw something.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.588
Where are all the people
he talked about?

23:13.058 --> 23:14.434
MEL:
If he thinks that we're going

23:14.476 --> 23:15.852
to sit down
and break bread with him,

23:15.894 --> 23:17.604
he's even crazier
than I thought.

23:17.646 --> 23:19.856
Hello, Charmed Ones.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.733
Took you long enough.

23:21.775 --> 23:26.196
Don't fret. You made it
just in time for the show.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.041
An entire movement
of magical creatures.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.501
Who were all buying into the
Tallyman's brand of crazy.

23:39.543 --> 23:41.503
We were so focused
on stopping him, we were blind

23:41.545 --> 23:43.088
to just how many people
he was affecting.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.714
The problem is, we have no idea

23:44.756 --> 23:46.967
if the Unseen are dozens,
hundreds, maybe thousands?

23:47.008 --> 23:48.468
Boss has been waiting for you.

23:51.805 --> 23:52.889
Not you.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.558
Okay.

23:54.599 --> 23:56.601
Uh,

23:56.643 --> 23:58.228
I'll see you back
at the command center.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.903
I hope you enjoyed
my puzzle box.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.823
I knew you smart cookies
would figure it out.

24:09.865 --> 24:13.410
And I hope
Maggie will be joining us.

24:13.452 --> 24:16.746
It would be a shame if she
missed our little dinner party.

24:16.788 --> 24:18.331
It's gonna be a blast.

24:18.373 --> 24:20.292
Cut the gracious host crap.

24:20.333 --> 24:22.252
Now why are we here?

24:22.294 --> 24:24.880
Someone never learned
the fine art of small talk.

24:24.921 --> 24:27.007
Who are you... really?

24:27.048 --> 24:29.092
I am revolution.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.510
You got us here.

24:30.552 --> 24:31.803
What do you want?

24:31.845 --> 24:33.472
Well, it's not really a matter

24:33.513 --> 24:35.098
of what I want.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.518
It's a matter of what
the magical world needs.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.520
And what is that?
TALLYMAN:
Chaos.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.024
Destruction, rebirth.

24:44.065 --> 24:47.068
And, of course, reformation.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.696
I've got to go.
Enjoy your dinner.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.698
The main event will begin
shortly.

24:51.740 --> 24:53.283
This is a dead end.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.285
He clearly didn't bring us here
to save lives.

24:55.327 --> 24:57.245
We can't just sit here
doing nothing.

24:57.287 --> 24:58.330
We need to figure out

24:58.371 --> 25:00.248
where he is and go get him. Aah!

25:00.290 --> 25:02.501
Something bit me!

25:02.542 --> 25:05.045
Oh, I got it.
Let's get you back

25:05.086 --> 25:06.755
to the command center
and treat that bite.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.885
You have
to forgive yourself.

25:11.927 --> 25:14.137
I wish I could.

25:14.179 --> 25:18.058
I just don't know how.
Yes, you do.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.435
You want to know
how I know that you can?

25:20.477 --> 25:22.312
When you were little,

25:22.354 --> 25:25.565
and I used to promise
to come and pick you up, hmm,

25:25.607 --> 25:27.067
and then I wouldn't show up
because...

25:27.108 --> 25:28.693
well, because I was being
a selfish jerk.

25:28.735 --> 25:32.781
But then, the next time,
there you were,

25:32.822 --> 25:37.160
sitting at the door,
and every time after that.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.371
My little pink suitcase packed.

25:39.412 --> 25:42.332
That's right.

25:42.374 --> 25:46.002
You forgave me,
without even thinking about it.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.339
Now, if you can do that for me,

25:49.381 --> 25:52.342
you can most certainly do that
for yourself.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.762
And lean on
your sister, hon.

25:55.804 --> 25:59.849
'Cause I always thought
that-that your thing,

25:59.891 --> 26:02.852
the-the thing
that makes you you,

26:02.894 --> 26:04.396
is your connection with her.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.232
Hmm?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.900
What did Mom always say?

26:11.987 --> 26:14.281
You're stronger together.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.409
(sniffles)
(phone chirps)

26:20.203 --> 26:21.997
Speaking of which...

26:22.038 --> 26:23.999
Hmm.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.585
Go. Go, go. Go be with her.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.422
I love you, Dad.

26:30.463 --> 26:33.466
Oh, I love you,
too, Little Bug.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.387
ROXIE:
I don't know, Harry.

26:37.429 --> 26:39.389
It's still pretty
touch-and-go in there.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.349
Be careful.

26:41.391 --> 26:43.768
HARRY:
I know. I will.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.229
I have to keep going.

26:46.271 --> 26:48.481
ROXIE:
You sure you're ready for this?

26:48.523 --> 26:50.525
I have to practice,

26:50.567 --> 26:53.236
get better if I'm ever
going to see Macy.

26:53.278 --> 26:54.487
Macy?

26:54.529 --> 26:56.615
(panting)

26:59.534 --> 27:01.661
(panting)

27:01.703 --> 27:03.663
(whooshing)

27:03.705 --> 27:06.875
(groaning)

27:06.916 --> 27:08.835
Harry?! Harry!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.420
Don't get too close!

27:10.462 --> 27:11.963
Not while he's
talking to the dead.

27:12.005 --> 27:14.507
Talking to the dead?

27:14.549 --> 27:16.468
You're telling me that

27:16.509 --> 27:18.178
Donnie's...?

27:18.219 --> 27:20.639
Gone. Sunny killed him
just before she escaped,

27:20.680 --> 27:23.058
probably to keep
his mouth shut.

27:23.099 --> 27:24.225
(yelling)

27:24.267 --> 27:25.894
What did you do to my friend?

27:25.935 --> 27:29.439
I gave him what he's been
missing for months: purpose.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.233
(gasps)
Harry.

27:36.571 --> 27:39.491
There. That should neutralize
any poison

27:39.532 --> 27:41.534
he might have put
in that spider.

27:41.576 --> 27:42.744
Any luck?

27:42.786 --> 27:46.206
(groans)
This is more intricate

27:46.247 --> 27:48.249
than an Alfa Romeo twin turbo.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.501
MAGGIE:
Mel.

27:49.542 --> 27:51.419
Did you get any of my texts?

27:51.461 --> 27:52.921
Where have you been?
Sorry.

27:52.962 --> 27:54.422
I was trapped
in a room with Dad.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.882
What?!
It's a long story.

27:55.924 --> 27:58.510
I'll fill you in later.

27:58.551 --> 28:00.095
(ticking)

28:00.136 --> 28:01.221
Is that ticking?

28:01.262 --> 28:04.432
(ticking)
Maggie, get back!

28:04.474 --> 28:06.184
Alligatum est.

28:09.938 --> 28:12.107
Oh, my God.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.150
He isn't just using these
spiders for surveillance.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.319
He's using them as bombs.
Okay.

28:16.361 --> 28:18.321
We need to find him
before he goes full Unabomber.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.532
Is this the puzzle box
you were texting me about?

28:20.573 --> 28:22.992
Yeah.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.453
(magical chime)

28:26.996 --> 28:28.415
There's a family,

28:28.456 --> 28:31.501
a lot of people,
maybe a convention?

28:31.543 --> 28:34.671
I'm sorry. It's blurry.

28:39.467 --> 28:42.178
(echoing):
What did Mom always say?

28:42.220 --> 28:45.223
Stronger together.

28:45.265 --> 28:49.602
Mel, Kaela,
I need the Power of Three.

28:53.606 --> 28:55.692
(magical chime)

28:55.734 --> 29:00.447
Come on. Come on.
I need something specific.

29:00.488 --> 29:03.742
(coughing)
Oh, God.

29:03.783 --> 29:05.744
Something bad, really bad.
(baby crying)

29:05.785 --> 29:09.581
A lot of people hurt.
(coughing)

29:09.622 --> 29:12.542
He's at the Gnome Is Where
the Hearth Is Hotel.

29:12.584 --> 29:15.378
I've been there.
It's in New York.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.883
(beeping)

29:27.766 --> 29:29.851
(indistinct chatter)

29:49.537 --> 29:54.042
KAELA:
Why are all
these people here?

29:54.083 --> 29:56.878
The one-year anniversary
of the Faction's defeat.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.546
What's the Faction?

29:58.588 --> 30:00.507
A group of
power-hungry humans

30:00.548 --> 30:02.217
who were experimenting on
and killing magical creatures

30:02.258 --> 30:04.219
in an attempt to steal
the magic for themselves.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.929
Okay. So dude's
really gonna come

30:05.970 --> 30:07.722
and blow up a bunch
of people who were here

30:07.764 --> 30:10.391
remembering their lost loved
ones? Could you get any lower?

30:10.433 --> 30:13.478
We have
to get these people out. Now.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.442
Dev? Is this the gig
he was talking about?

30:19.484 --> 30:21.486
Hey.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.239
Hey, I-I know I'm not
your favorite person right now,

30:24.280 --> 30:25.824
but I need you to listen to me.

30:25.865 --> 30:28.201
The Tallyman is here.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.538
He's programmed these
mechanical spiders to be bombs,

30:31.579 --> 30:35.208
and God knows how many are
crawling all over this place.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.502
It could... it could blow
at any second.

30:38.461 --> 30:41.297
Why should I believe you?

30:41.339 --> 30:44.092
Because why would I lie
about something like that?

30:44.133 --> 30:47.554
To save your reputation,
make you seem more like a hero.

30:47.595 --> 30:50.181
No. Uh, this is not
a PR stunt.

30:50.223 --> 30:52.267
Listen to me.
This is real.

30:52.308 --> 30:55.311
Are you real? Is anything
we shared the other day real?

30:55.353 --> 30:58.940
People are saying you're
not even a real witch.

30:58.982 --> 31:02.735
Are they lying, or are you?

31:08.992 --> 31:11.077
Almost showtime.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.162
MEL:
It's him.

31:13.204 --> 31:14.581
We just have to be careful about

31:14.622 --> 31:16.291
how we take him down.

31:16.332 --> 31:17.792
There are families around.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.049
(crowd gasping, chattering)

31:28.136 --> 31:30.638
(panting)

31:31.598 --> 31:33.850
(groaning)

31:37.729 --> 31:40.189
(ticking)

31:40.231 --> 31:41.649
You know what?
You're right.

31:41.691 --> 31:45.194
I'm not. I'm not a real witch.

31:45.236 --> 31:46.696
You know, not too long ago,

31:46.738 --> 31:48.072
I was just a girl
living in Philly.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.283
And then, um, all of a sudden,

31:50.325 --> 31:53.995
I find out that I'm... magical.

31:54.037 --> 31:56.915
I've been thrown
some curveballs in my life.

31:56.956 --> 31:59.042
Adoption, cancer.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.835
I've learned to roll
with the punches,

32:00.877 --> 32:04.088
and not let anyone or anything
affect me too deeply.

32:04.130 --> 32:07.508
But this...
this is affecting me.

32:07.550 --> 32:09.594
It's affecting me deeply.

32:09.636 --> 32:12.847
Okay, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

32:12.889 --> 32:17.602
No idea how to carry this...
this burden.

32:17.644 --> 32:21.648
Maybe a real witch would,
but I'm just me

32:21.689 --> 32:24.359
and I'm asking you to get your
ass off this stage right now

32:24.400 --> 32:26.235
because I like you,

32:26.277 --> 32:29.489
and I could never
forgive myself if I let you die.

32:34.452 --> 32:36.579
You need to get off
the stage.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.587
(pants, grunts)

32:48.633 --> 32:49.801
(banging on doors)

32:49.842 --> 32:51.970
Give up. There's
nowhere to run.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.180
Call off your spiders,
and we'll let you live.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.848
(both panting)

32:57.183 --> 33:00.728
Sorry. The show must go on.

You're not supposed to be here!
What's the matter?

33:37.181 --> 33:39.684
No clever riddles
coming to mind?

33:39.726 --> 33:42.061
This isn't fair!
I planned this whole thing.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.648
You're supposed to be watching

33:45.690 --> 33:48.234

33:49.527 --> 33:51.529
He's gonna blow himself up,

33:51.571 --> 33:53.781
just like the Leprechaun
and the Lamia.

Oh.

34:27.815 --> 34:29.942
JORDAN:
I healed you

34:29.984 --> 34:31.694
after you passed out.

34:31.736 --> 34:35.073
Thank you.

34:35.114 --> 34:37.575
Sunny didn't poison you,

34:37.617 --> 34:40.328
did she?

34:41.287 --> 34:43.372
No.

34:47.085 --> 34:51.881
And that... thing you were
doing with Donnie's corpse?

34:53.841 --> 34:57.136
I was talking to him...

34:57.178 --> 34:59.764
in the Veil.

34:59.806 --> 35:02.225
The Veil?
Yes.

35:02.266 --> 35:05.728
It's a place
where the dead linger

35:05.770 --> 35:07.522
when they have
unfinished business.

35:07.563 --> 35:10.191
Oh.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.444
So you've been
hanging out down there,

35:13.486 --> 35:15.655
just having tea
with a bunch of corpses?

35:15.696 --> 35:17.240
No, it's not that simple.

35:17.281 --> 35:20.159
Then tell me, damn it!

35:20.201 --> 35:21.494
What happened to you?

35:21.536 --> 35:23.746
I...

35:26.624 --> 35:28.876
I gave up my powers

35:28.918 --> 35:32.630
in exchange for the ability
to talk to the dead.

35:37.051 --> 35:39.720
Which I suppose makes me
a Necrolighter.

35:41.639 --> 35:43.432
Ah.

35:45.351 --> 35:47.311
This is about Macy.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.355
Isn't it?

35:49.397 --> 35:51.315
(exhales)

35:52.942 --> 35:55.027
(sighs)

36:08.332 --> 36:10.501
You have
to let her go, man.

36:16.048 --> 36:18.593
I tried.

36:22.054 --> 36:24.307
I really tried.

36:28.436 --> 36:30.104
Hey.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.482
(gasps)
