WEBVTT

01:24.833 --> 01:26.250
[horn wailing]

01:31.208 --> 01:32.041
Up!

01:33.958 --> 01:35.375
Tommy, take it up!

01:37.833 --> 01:40.750
He's big-dealing the fuck
out of every lift, Bob. You put him in.

01:41.958 --> 01:45.083
If every pillar takes four days,
you're looking at a six-month delay.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.291
That's your guy.

01:46.375 --> 01:48.250
[Robert] You need to calm down, brother.

01:48.333 --> 01:51.208
I promised my daughter she'd be
the first one to cross this bridge.

01:51.666 --> 01:53.791
[Robert chuckles] The one
who hasn't even been born yet?

01:53.875 --> 01:55.000
That's the one.

01:55.083 --> 01:56.291
-Go up!
-[Robert laughing]

01:57.000 --> 01:59.958
Why are you coming down again?
Get him out, man.

02:00.041 --> 02:02.666
-How is Martha?
-Martha's fine. She's always fine.

02:02.750 --> 02:04.958
-Hey, what time is it?
-[Robert] Three.

02:05.041 --> 02:06.958
Mark and Wendell are on break.

02:07.041 --> 02:08.041
[Robert] All right.

02:08.125 --> 02:11.083
[Robert] Hey, I need you to sign off
on Jimmy's time card tomorrow!

02:11.166 --> 02:13.125
-Tomorrow!
-[Robert] All right!

02:14.000 --> 02:15.208
[indistinct chatter]

02:32.875 --> 02:34.166
[indistinct chatter]

02:44.083 --> 02:45.916
-[Martha] It's low.
-[woman] She kicking a lot?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.291
[Martha] Is she… Yeah, um…

02:47.375 --> 02:49.708
-Yeah. She's moving around a lot now.
-Top or bottom?

02:49.791 --> 02:51.833
-[Martha] Sorry?
-Is she mostly at the top or bottom?

02:51.916 --> 02:52.958
[Martha] It's late.

02:53.916 --> 02:56.375
-It's not exactly pleasant.
-You're so lucky.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.083
[Martha] Aw, that's really nice.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.125
-Yeah.
-Thank you. We'll see how it goes.

03:06.250 --> 03:08.083
[sighs in frustration] Fuck.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.416
First, need you to…

03:22.375 --> 03:23.333
sign right here.

03:25.916 --> 03:26.958
[Martha] Mm-hmm.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.250
Initial.

03:30.666 --> 03:31.500
[Chris] Date.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.500
You forgot down here.

03:36.166 --> 03:37.541
Initial. Right next to--

03:37.625 --> 03:39.625
If you guys are all set,
I'm gonna take off.

03:39.708 --> 03:40.958
-[Martha] Bye, sis.
-Thank you.

03:41.041 --> 03:42.458
-[Anita] Bye.
-[Chris] See you later.

03:42.541 --> 03:43.958
I love you. See you at home.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.208
-All right.
-[Anita] Good luck.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.750
And then, for you…

03:48.166 --> 03:50.708
I just need one on the bottom.

03:52.333 --> 03:55.000
And then, you're good.
You got yourselves a car.

03:55.083 --> 03:57.583
-Thank you, Chris.
-[Chris] Of course. My pleasure.

03:58.083 --> 04:00.416
You're thanking him
for his getting commission.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.166
-Thank me, I'm buying it.
-Thanks, Mom.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.208
[Chris] Thank you.

04:04.250 --> 04:06.041
Thank you for that.

04:06.125 --> 04:07.625
Congrats. You got a car.

04:07.708 --> 04:10.291
-[Elizabeth] I'm glad you made it.
-Congrats. All set.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.875
[Elizabeth] I've been meaning to ask,

04:11.958 --> 04:15.125
how is it you can build a bridge
when you can't tell time?

04:15.208 --> 04:17.250
[forced laughter]

04:17.333 --> 04:21.166
That's-- that's very good.
Oh, that's very funny.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.916
In the back. I had them move it.
So I'll be there in a second.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.333
-[Martha] Thanks.
-[Elizabeth] Bye.

04:25.416 --> 04:29.083
Just one last thing.
I need your social security right here.

04:29.166 --> 04:32.583
-What do you need my social security for?
-Just like a credit thing.

04:32.666 --> 04:35.125
-She likes you. She just can't show it.
-[Sean] No, she doesn't.

04:35.208 --> 04:37.833
-She did just buy us a car.
-[Sean] She did.

04:37.916 --> 04:41.208
But it was also a statement.
She bought the car knowing I could buy it.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.791
She wanted to minimize me.
It's not here. Next room.

04:44.416 --> 04:46.833
That's why she bought a minivan.
She wants to emasculate me.

04:46.916 --> 04:47.916
[horn honking]

04:48.000 --> 04:49.333
That's a good horn. Whoo!

04:49.416 --> 04:51.208
-[continues honking]
-The power.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.583
-[roars]
-Anita was so jealous.

04:53.666 --> 04:56.333
Oh, my goodness.
Who cares what Anita thinks? Fuck her.

04:56.416 --> 04:59.333
-What does it matter?
-It doesn't matter. It's just…

04:59.416 --> 05:02.666
It doesn't matter at all.
That's what matters. Look at that thing.

05:02.750 --> 05:04.583
[Sean cheering]

05:04.666 --> 05:05.708
[Martha] Oh, my God!

05:06.791 --> 05:09.750
And she got it gray like her soul.
It's wonderful.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.708
-It's her spirit color.
-Whoa. This is us now.

05:12.791 --> 05:13.875
Yeah, it is.

05:14.375 --> 05:16.958
That's what matters right there.
Cloth seats matter.

05:17.041 --> 05:20.000
-Oh!
-Seat heaters matter, airbags matter.

05:20.083 --> 05:23.291
-I think you're gonna look good in this.
-Oh, yeah, this is it for me.

05:23.375 --> 05:24.666
[both chuckling]

05:25.416 --> 05:26.791
-[Sean] Ooh!
-Oh.

05:28.666 --> 05:30.708
-The three of us matter.
-Yeah.

05:30.791 --> 05:33.375
It's the tribe that matters.
Who cares what she thinks?

05:33.458 --> 05:36.375
You know what matters?
This is what matters here.

05:37.041 --> 05:37.916
Yeah.

05:39.500 --> 05:41.833
-Well, I got us something.
-Oh, my God.

05:42.708 --> 05:44.375
That is so cute.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.625
Hey.

05:45.708 --> 05:46.708
Wait, is it…

05:47.958 --> 05:50.833
-Is this the wrong way around?
-It's the right way around.

05:50.916 --> 05:52.250
No, it's upside down. [chuckles]

05:52.333 --> 05:55.083
No, that's how I did it.
It was a choice. That's my daughter.

05:55.166 --> 05:57.875
Wonky, interesting, charming, intelligent.

05:57.958 --> 05:59.833
-Modest.
-Modest, humble.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.958
-[Sean] Should I call her?
-Yeah.

06:47.041 --> 06:49.458
-Do you want some water or something?
-No.

06:52.541 --> 06:55.250
[Sean] We're moving right along.
Why don't you sit down, baby?

06:55.333 --> 06:57.541
-Yeah, I will after a little.
-Huh?

06:59.083 --> 06:59.916
Sit.

07:01.250 --> 07:05.041
-[Martha breathing heavily]
-[line ringing]

07:09.875 --> 07:11.833
Of course,
now she's not picking up the phone.

07:11.916 --> 07:14.041
Hey, Barbara, hi, it's us again.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.500
So we're having
six-minute contractions now.

07:16.583 --> 07:18.583
It's moving-- We're, uh, we're moving.

07:18.666 --> 07:22.083
We're finding our pace, we're getting
a little bit of a rhythm going,

07:22.166 --> 07:23.500
and we feel pretty good.

07:26.458 --> 07:27.291
When?

07:31.958 --> 07:33.083
Oh, really?

07:35.875 --> 07:39.250
Yeah, I mean, it's new,
but, uh… what can you do?

07:39.333 --> 07:42.291
Okay, well, just keep us up to speed.
We're on the phone.

07:43.125 --> 07:44.041
Thank you.

07:45.583 --> 07:48.583
Ah, okay. Remember we went
to the prenatal meetings and they said,

07:48.666 --> 07:52.250
"Listen. We're gonna flip some cards.
Maybe something might not go perfectly,

07:52.333 --> 07:55.000
might not go according to plan,
things might change."

07:55.708 --> 07:58.208
-We're flipping cards.
-In what way?

07:58.291 --> 08:01.833
So, Barbara has…
She's in the middle of a heavy labor.

08:01.916 --> 08:04.166
-[Martha] She's in a labor?
-Do you remember Eva?

08:04.250 --> 08:05.708
I do, but I'm in my labor--

08:05.791 --> 08:07.666
-We liked her very much--
-Can you call her?

08:07.750 --> 08:09.916
-Eva?
-Yes. I want to talk-- No, Barbara.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.625
-I wanna talk to her myself.
-She's in the middle of a labor.

08:12.708 --> 08:14.000
Well, so am I.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.333
[exhales] Yeah.

08:17.375 --> 08:21.583
[line ringing]

08:21.666 --> 08:24.541
-[Sean] It's nothing to freak out about.
-I'm not freaking out.

08:24.625 --> 08:26.708
-I just want her here.
-[Sean] Okay.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.625
Like, how long is it gonna take?
Did she say?

08:29.708 --> 08:32.541
[Sean] Eva's coming now
and Barbara's gonna come when she can.

08:33.208 --> 08:34.333
I'm not in control.

08:34.416 --> 08:36.458
-I'm just relaying information.
-No. Shh.

08:36.541 --> 08:38.375
[Sean]
She'll be here when she can get here.

08:38.458 --> 08:41.250
That's what I'm saying. Just calm down.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.958
Let's do something else.
How about that? Let's dance.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.666
-Come here.
-[Martha] I don't wanna dance.

08:45.750 --> 08:47.125
Distract me with something.

08:47.208 --> 08:50.458
[Sean] Distract you with something?
Like… a joke or something?

08:50.541 --> 08:51.708
Yeah.

08:51.791 --> 08:55.208
[Sean] A joke about something you like.
What's in the fridge?

08:55.291 --> 08:57.708
Broccoli? Broccoli is in the fridge.

08:57.791 --> 08:59.916
Broccoli's favorite music.
You know what it is?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.625
You know what
broccoli's favorite music is?

09:01.708 --> 09:03.500
-What is it?
-Brock and roll.

09:03.583 --> 09:05.333
-[laughing] No, it's not.
-Yes, it fucking is.

09:05.416 --> 09:08.875
-That doesn't go with broccoli at all.
-Where does broccoli go get a drink?

09:08.958 --> 09:10.875
-Where?
-At the salad bar.

09:10.958 --> 09:12.958
Come on, G. Come on!

09:13.041 --> 09:14.208
[Martha] You're so pathetic.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.958
[Sean] Aw, wow.

09:17.041 --> 09:18.666
-[Martha] What's that?
-Okay, okay, okay.

09:18.750 --> 09:19.833
[Martha] Is that my water?

09:21.083 --> 09:23.041
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

09:24.791 --> 09:26.250
[Martha] What does that mean?

09:28.125 --> 09:29.375
Where is she?

09:32.250 --> 09:33.458
-Here we go.
-[Martha] Shit.

09:33.541 --> 09:34.625
Let's get you out.

09:36.833 --> 09:38.875
-Are these wet too?
-[Martha] No, that's fine.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.541
-[Sean] Okay.
-[Martha] Can you call her again?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.083
-Because this is--
-[Sean] I will.

09:47.416 --> 09:50.083
This is actually hurting now. Oh, God.

09:50.833 --> 09:51.958
Whoo!

09:52.750 --> 09:54.791
Whoa! [chuckles]

09:55.833 --> 09:56.958
Whoo…

09:58.666 --> 10:00.666
[groans]

10:01.583 --> 10:03.541
Oh, God. Fuck.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.416
Don't look at me like that.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.916
[Sean] Why don't you come over here?

10:12.541 --> 10:14.666
-Come here, baby.
-Oh, God.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.833
[Sean] Come here.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.291
[Martha] Not on that ball.

10:20.375 --> 10:24.000
You don't wanna sit on the ball?
That's what they gave it to us for.

10:24.083 --> 10:27.791
-Why don't you do the stretch thing?
-Screw the stretch thing.

10:28.541 --> 10:30.791
-Careful.
-Fuck. I don't really wanna do this.

10:31.541 --> 10:33.500
[belches] Why do I feel so sick?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.416
Wanna do it this way?

10:38.041 --> 10:39.083
[exhales]

10:39.791 --> 10:41.666
-What is the move?
-Hmm?

10:42.291 --> 10:43.875
[laughs]

10:44.833 --> 10:46.708
Oh, God. Sorry. [belches]

10:47.666 --> 10:50.083
[panting]

10:50.166 --> 10:51.625
This feels weird.

10:52.625 --> 10:55.083
I need to-- Ugh, I feel so nauseous.

10:58.916 --> 11:00.416
-Can you rub my back?
-Mm-hmm.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.958
-[Martha] Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.083
Oh, shit.

11:07.791 --> 11:08.625
[groans]

11:09.625 --> 11:11.208
I might throw up.

11:11.791 --> 11:14.000
[Sean] You didn't eat enough.
What are you gonna throw up?

11:14.083 --> 11:15.958
[belches] I don't know. Sorry.

11:20.166 --> 11:23.125
-You look very handsome.
-[Sean] Thank you.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.916
[chuckles] You also look super scared.

11:27.000 --> 11:27.916
[Sean] I'm not.

11:28.833 --> 11:30.500
-Really?
-[Sean] Really.

11:30.583 --> 11:32.458
-You freaking out?
-[Sean] Not at all.

11:33.208 --> 11:35.208
Your eyes look super, like

11:36.791 --> 11:37.916
anxious.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.208
-I'm not.
-Give me a kiss, then.

11:40.291 --> 11:41.416
You want kisses?

11:45.458 --> 11:47.333
-[doorbell rings]
-Not too much.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.750
That's her.

11:48.833 --> 11:51.458
Look how quick that was.
Look how fast that happened.

11:52.250 --> 11:53.291
-Hey.
-Hi.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.291
We're six minutes between contractions
and her water just broke.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.500
Oh, wow.

11:58.583 --> 12:00.375
[Martha groaning]

12:00.458 --> 12:03.500
-[Eva] That's great. How you doing?
-[Sean] I'm doing all right. How are you?

12:03.583 --> 12:05.958
-[Eva] Good. Yeah. You talk to Barbara?
-[Sean] Yes.

12:06.041 --> 12:08.208
-[Eva] Okay, great. How are you doing?
-[Sean] I'm good.

12:08.291 --> 12:10.333
[groaning and belching]

12:19.541 --> 12:21.416
-[Sean] You want some water?
-No, I'm good.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.833
-Is Barbara here? Is she coming?
-[Sean] You want water?

12:23.916 --> 12:26.625
-Hi. Hi, Martha.
-Hi. [belches] Hi.

12:27.541 --> 12:30.833
Sorry, I just feel super sick.
Can you get me some water?

12:30.916 --> 12:32.583
-[Sean] Okay.
-Thanks. I need it.

12:32.666 --> 12:34.083
How's it going?

12:34.166 --> 12:38.166
It's fine. It's just the last two
have been really intense.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.291
Mm-hmm.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.666
-[Martha] I know--
-Closer together.

12:41.750 --> 12:43.666
[Martha] They are. Super nauseous.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.333
-That's…
-[Martha] I haven't really…

12:46.708 --> 12:50.041
-Have you been throwing up?
-[Sean] No, she didn't eat anything.

12:50.125 --> 12:52.583
-Okay. You know…
-[Sean and Martha chatting indistinctly]

12:52.666 --> 12:55.958
That's pretty normal, actually.
It's actually kind of a good sign.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.458
-Is it?
-Means it's moving along.

12:57.541 --> 12:59.416
I'm really sweaty. Can you hold me?

13:03.541 --> 13:06.458
[Eva] Hey.
I know you were expecting Barbara,

13:07.250 --> 13:10.583
and I know it's always
a bit weird when things change,

13:10.666 --> 13:12.791
but I'm so happy to be here, okay?

13:12.875 --> 13:16.041
-I'm gonna stay with you.
-Another one's coming.

13:16.125 --> 13:17.208
Oh, God.

13:18.291 --> 13:20.375
[Eva] Okay. Okay.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.791
Do I just breathe or what do…

13:24.583 --> 13:26.041
-Remember this?
-Yeah.

13:26.125 --> 13:29.166
-[Martha chuckling and groaning]
-[Eva] Okay. Yeah.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.708
[Martha whimpering, crying]

13:30.791 --> 13:32.041
[Eva] Sweetheart.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.500
What the… [inhales deeply]

13:35.083 --> 13:38.875
Oh, this is really awful.

13:41.375 --> 13:43.208
[groans]

13:45.041 --> 13:47.458
[Eva] You're doing so great. Breathe.

13:47.541 --> 13:51.083
You're doing so great.
You're doing so great.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.083
-[Martha] You got any painkillers?
-[Eva] Okay.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.625
-See, they come up…
-[mumbling curses]

13:54.708 --> 13:57.125
…and then they go down
and you just ride them.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.291
This is awful.

13:59.375 --> 14:03.500
[Eva] I-- I just want to have
a quick listen to her heartbeat. Okay?

14:03.583 --> 14:06.916
-And just see how she's tolerating labor.
-Have you got the water?

14:07.000 --> 14:10.625
[Eva] Could you maybe
just lie down here for just a second?

14:12.375 --> 14:15.875
-Can you hold my hand or my head?
-[Sean] Yeah, of course.

14:15.958 --> 14:16.833
Just need to…

14:16.916 --> 14:18.708
-[Martha] You got the water?
-[Sean] Yeah.

14:18.791 --> 14:22.125
I'm gonna put this on your belly.
It's a little bit cold, okay?

14:23.208 --> 14:25.208
[Martha] What's this for?
Oh, for the heartbeat?

14:25.291 --> 14:26.375
[Eva] Yeah.

14:26.458 --> 14:29.000
[Martha groaning]

14:30.958 --> 14:33.833
-Why is this not coming out?
-[machine whirring]

14:33.916 --> 14:35.833
-[Sean] You gotta squeeze it here.
-Hey. Listen.

14:35.916 --> 14:37.500
-[baby's heart beating]
-[Sean] Listen.

14:37.583 --> 14:38.541
[Martha] Are you okay?

14:38.625 --> 14:40.000
-[Eva] Can you hear that?
-Wow.

14:40.916 --> 14:43.833
-[Eva] It's really strong. That's great.
-You hear that?

14:43.916 --> 14:46.166
-[Eva] She sounds really good.
-Hi, baby.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.208
-[Eva] Hi, baby.
-[Martha sighs]

14:48.291 --> 14:51.250
[Eva] Aw. Okay, good. Great. You got it!

14:52.291 --> 14:53.958
-I'm gonna do…
-Did you hear that?

14:54.041 --> 14:55.250
-[Sean] Yeah.
-[Eva] Martha.

14:55.875 --> 14:59.125
Martha, I'm gonna get you
to scooch your bum onto this.

14:59.208 --> 15:02.208
I need to do…
Just to see where you're…

15:04.333 --> 15:07.416
Where you're at, okay?
Gonna do a little internal exam.

15:08.458 --> 15:11.041
-To see how dilated you are.
-I like your glasses.

15:11.125 --> 15:12.083
[Eva] Thank you.

15:17.208 --> 15:19.041
Hmm.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.041
-Those are pretty quick together.
-[Martha] Regret not having the epidural.

15:22.125 --> 15:24.791
I think that's a bit
closer than six, right?

15:24.875 --> 15:25.958
-[Sean] Way.
-[Martha] Okay.

15:26.041 --> 15:26.916
What?

15:27.375 --> 15:30.041
[Sean] Talking about the time
between contractions.

15:30.125 --> 15:31.166
[Eva] Okay.

15:31.958 --> 15:33.041
[Sean] Quicker than six.

15:35.291 --> 15:38.833
[Eva] Okay, let's move your legs
right like this. Okay.

15:40.041 --> 15:41.583
Okay. Yeah.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.083
Just gonna put my fingers in
and touch your cervix.

15:45.166 --> 15:47.583
Yeah, it can be
a little bit uncomfortable.

15:47.666 --> 15:49.416
[Martha whimpering]

15:49.500 --> 15:51.625
[Eva] Okay. Wow.

15:52.916 --> 15:55.958
You're, like, six centimeters.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.958
And the baby's really low.

15:59.666 --> 16:00.708
[Martha] She's coming?

16:00.791 --> 16:03.333
-[Eva] She's coming. It's good.
-[Martha] So fast.

16:03.416 --> 16:06.500
-It's great. You're doing great. Okay.
-[Martha] It's just so quick.

16:08.416 --> 16:09.458
[Eva] You're doing great.

16:09.541 --> 16:11.958
-Okay.
-[Eva] Yeah. Totally great.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.000
Hey.

16:15.125 --> 16:16.791
-[Martha] Hi.
-Hmm?

16:17.750 --> 16:19.458
-[Martha] I feel super sick.
-[Eva] Yeah.

16:19.541 --> 16:22.625
Ow, ow. Oh… No, no, no…

16:22.708 --> 16:24.041
[Eva] Okay, listen…

16:24.125 --> 16:26.958
-Just breathe.
-[groaning] Wait, wait, wait…

16:29.208 --> 16:30.875
[howling in pain]

16:31.541 --> 16:32.583
[Eva] Okay.

16:35.916 --> 16:38.041
Oh, my God! Fuck!

16:49.291 --> 16:50.125
[Eva] Yeah.

16:54.541 --> 16:57.500
-[Martha] Oh, God!
-It's really happening now.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.333
-Yeah.
-[Martha] This is so bad.

16:59.416 --> 17:00.916
-Listen.
-[Martha] This is awful.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.041
Hey, Martha. How do you think
it would feel to be in water?

17:04.125 --> 17:06.958
-I think we need to get her in the bath.
-[Martha] What the fuck!

17:07.041 --> 17:08.375
-Run a bath?
-[Sean] Yeah.

17:08.458 --> 17:11.125
-And I'll just stay for a sec.
-[Sean] Baby, you want a bath?

17:11.208 --> 17:13.750
This is awful. This is so terrible.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.791
-[Sean] Wanna take a bath?
-Yes, whatever. Yes.

17:15.875 --> 17:18.833
-[Eva] Okay.
-Oh, God. I'm gonna be sick.

17:18.916 --> 17:19.833
[Eva] Okay.

17:19.916 --> 17:21.000
Ow!

17:21.750 --> 17:23.916
[Eva laughing] Okay! You're too out of it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.375
I can't do this.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.791
Eva, where's Barbara?

17:27.875 --> 17:29.166
[Eva] Yeah, you can.

17:29.250 --> 17:31.291
You're nice, but I can't do this.

17:31.375 --> 17:34.500
-You're already doing it.
-Oh, my God. What the fuck?

17:35.166 --> 17:37.208
-I can't do it.
-Hey, you're doing it.

17:37.291 --> 17:38.708
We're gonna get up now.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.666
We're gonna get up
and we're gonna go into the bathroom.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.208
Come on. Come on.

17:44.583 --> 17:47.375
-Come on, come on, come on…
-[Martha whimpering]

17:50.166 --> 17:51.000
[Eva] There you go.

17:51.083 --> 17:52.458
-[Martha] I can't.
-[Sean] Okay.

17:53.833 --> 17:56.541
Put your hands on here.
We're gonna get you up.

17:56.625 --> 18:00.125
-Just have a little walk into the bath.
-One, two, three.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.958
-There we go.
-[Eva] Okay.

18:02.791 --> 18:04.250
-I can't do this.
-[Eva] Okay.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.458
-Is my ass out?
-[Sean] Just drop your weight, baby.

18:07.541 --> 18:08.708
-Okay.
-[Martha] She's mean.

18:08.791 --> 18:11.083
No, you can walk. Come on. You can walk.

18:11.166 --> 18:13.166
-Let's go.
-I'm sorry. It's embarrassing.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.291
You can walk.

18:15.666 --> 18:18.291
-There you go. [laughing]
-[Martha] Did you ever do this before?

18:18.375 --> 18:20.000
[Eva] I've done this before.

18:20.083 --> 18:23.541
-[Martha belching] Oh, God.
-[Sean] How many kids do you have?

18:23.625 --> 18:25.875
-I have a little girl.
-I'm gonna be sick.

18:25.958 --> 18:28.541
-Little girl?
-I have a girl. I have a daughter.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.416
-Hey.
-God, this hurts.

18:30.500 --> 18:34.208
Have you taken the trash out? 'Cause I can
smell something really strange.

18:34.291 --> 18:37.750
[Sean] I'll take it out.
Let's just get you in the bathroom, yeah?

18:40.166 --> 18:42.041
-Come here.
-Okay.

18:42.125 --> 18:45.458
[Eva] Okay. You guys go on
and get in the bath.

18:45.541 --> 18:49.208
I'm gonna set up in the bedroom, okay?

18:52.000 --> 18:53.041
Okay.

19:00.583 --> 19:02.125
[Martha] It's gonna be all right.

19:02.208 --> 19:03.833
-[Eva] How you doing?
-[Sean] We're good.

19:03.916 --> 19:06.833
-[Eva] Good? Okay.
-[Sean] Yeah. Babe, lift your arms.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.333
[Martha] What? I'm trying.

19:10.208 --> 19:11.125
There we go.

19:11.750 --> 19:13.416
[Martha blows raspberry]

19:14.708 --> 19:17.416
[belches] Oh, this is super awful.

19:17.500 --> 19:20.833
This is really intense.
I can smell myself. Oh, God!

19:23.375 --> 19:25.291
-[Sean] The water's good?
-[Martha] Come on, baby.

19:25.375 --> 19:27.750
Please. Why can't she come out right now?

19:27.833 --> 19:28.958
[softly] Hold my hand.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.708
-[Martha exhales] This is better.
-[Sean] Right?

19:34.791 --> 19:37.083
-[Martha] Can you get some music?
-[Sean] Music?

19:37.166 --> 19:39.375
[Martha] And also maybe just
shut the lights off.

19:39.458 --> 19:40.458
[Sean] Yeah.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.875
-[Sean kisses] I love you.
-[Martha] Can you give me a kiss?

19:45.875 --> 19:47.625
-[Sean kisses]
-[Martha] I love you!

19:47.708 --> 19:50.500
-I love you. Are you okay?
-Yeah. Get the music.

19:50.583 --> 19:51.541
Okay.

20:28.250 --> 20:29.833
[soft music playing]

20:31.166 --> 20:32.375
[inhales deeply]

20:34.833 --> 20:35.875
Breathe, baby.

20:35.958 --> 20:36.958
I'm breathing.

20:37.041 --> 20:37.875
Okay.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.041
This is so bad.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.000
I think I'm gonna shit myself.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.625
[softly] Ow!

21:42.958 --> 21:44.375
[groaning slowly]

21:44.458 --> 21:46.791
[Eva] Hey, that's an interesting noise.

21:47.583 --> 21:48.875
[continues groaning]

21:48.958 --> 21:50.666
-[Sean] Hold still.
-Yeah.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.750
[Martha] God!

21:51.833 --> 21:55.083
It's like a pushing kinda noise.
Are you feeling like you wanna push?

21:55.166 --> 21:58.541
-I need to push.
-Okay. Let's get you out of the bath.

22:00.375 --> 22:01.416
Okay.

22:02.041 --> 22:04.833
-[Martha] Is that blood there?
-[Sean] Okay, come on.

22:04.916 --> 22:08.958
[Eva] It's okay. It's just a little bit.
It's totally okay.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.750
Here we go. Come on.
Let's go into the bedroom.

22:13.833 --> 22:14.958
[Martha] Push now, or…

22:15.041 --> 22:19.625
[Eva] Nope, you can't push now.
You just wait. I need to do a little bit…

22:20.958 --> 22:23.958
I need to check your dilation
before you push, okay?

22:24.875 --> 22:25.708
Just…

22:27.916 --> 22:29.250
Yeah. Yeah.

22:31.500 --> 22:32.958
[Sean] Lift up. There you go.

22:33.500 --> 22:35.583
-[Martha] Ow, ow.
-[Eva] Ooh, okay.

22:36.375 --> 22:37.583
Too fat.

22:40.208 --> 22:41.333
[Eva] Okay.

22:42.083 --> 22:44.375
[Martha crying out]

22:45.916 --> 22:47.541
-[Eva] Okay, Martha?
-Yeah?

22:47.625 --> 22:50.833
[Eva] I'm just gonna check your cervix
and see where you're at, okay?

22:52.875 --> 22:54.291
[Martha] Ow! Ow…

22:54.375 --> 22:58.625
I know, I know. Sorry, babe.
I feel the baby's head.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.250
-[Martha] You do? She's coming!
-I don't feel any cervix.

23:02.333 --> 23:03.500
[Martha] Come on, baby.

23:03.583 --> 23:05.291
I think you're fully dilated.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.333
-I think you're wide open.
-Easy for you, motherfucker.

23:08.416 --> 23:10.916
-[Eva] Hey, Martha.
-Yeah?

23:11.000 --> 23:13.625
[Eva] Now, if you feel like it,
you can push.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.875
When it comes, you can push, okay?

23:15.958 --> 23:18.541
Just give me two secs.

23:20.458 --> 23:21.833
Oh, my God!

23:21.916 --> 23:23.916
[Eva] Yeah. Yeah? Hey.

23:25.250 --> 23:27.041
[groaning loudly]

23:27.125 --> 23:28.333
[Eva] Attagirl.

23:29.416 --> 23:32.083
Attagirl. Attagirl.

23:33.833 --> 23:36.250
Oh, it's so good. Okay.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.750
-Good!
-[Sean] Good. Good.

23:40.916 --> 23:42.125
[Eva] Okay, okay.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.166
Attagirl. That's great.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.625
Just like that. You're a pro!

23:47.708 --> 23:48.833
Doing so great.

23:48.916 --> 23:53.791
I'm just gonna have a quick listen
and see how the baby's tolerating…

23:55.458 --> 23:56.958
the labor, okay?

23:58.333 --> 24:00.125
Yeah. Just rest, honey.

24:00.208 --> 24:02.375
-[Sean] Rest, honey.
-[Martha] I just wanna…

24:02.458 --> 24:04.083
[muffled whirring]

24:06.791 --> 24:09.250
[Martha breathing heavily]

24:10.916 --> 24:15.375
[clears throat] Okay, you know, Martha,
I'm gonna move you onto your side, okay?

24:15.458 --> 24:18.375
'Cause I don't think
the baby likes this position.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.541
-Yeah, just this way, I think.
-[Sean] Move her on her side?

24:22.125 --> 24:24.375
-[Sean] Come on.
-Yeah.

24:24.458 --> 24:28.166
-[Martha] -Oh, God! It's-- It's coming!
-[Eva] So, you do the next one from here.

24:28.250 --> 24:29.208
Okay.

24:29.291 --> 24:31.916
Yeah. Attagirl. You push right into me.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.625
[Martha groaning]

24:33.708 --> 24:34.541
[Eva] Yeah.

24:35.791 --> 24:37.000
Okay.

24:37.083 --> 24:38.833
-[Sean] Okay.
-[Eva] Bear down.

24:39.875 --> 24:44.541
-Good. Good, good, good…
-[Martha groaning in pain]

24:47.416 --> 24:50.000
[Eva] Okay. Okay, okay…

24:50.083 --> 24:53.833
[Martha] Is she here?
Where is she? Where is she?

24:53.916 --> 24:55.375
Okay, let's see.

24:57.250 --> 24:59.250
Now you just rest there a little bit.

24:59.333 --> 25:03.041
[whirring]

25:03.125 --> 25:06.416
Heart rate's not coming
all the way back up like we need it to.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.416
What do you mean?

25:10.375 --> 25:11.458
[Eva] I'm just gonna…

25:12.833 --> 25:16.500
-[Sean] Hold on a second. Wait.
-[Martha] Baby, no. Where are you going?

25:17.958 --> 25:19.583
[Sean] The heart rate's not coming up?

25:19.666 --> 25:22.333
It's fine. We've had
two consecutive contractions

25:22.416 --> 25:25.500
where the heartbeat hasn't come
all the way back up to where I want.

25:25.583 --> 25:28.750
But it's not outside the realm of normal.

25:28.833 --> 25:30.541
-What is the realm of normal?
-[Eva] Just…

25:30.625 --> 25:32.791
-I'm gonna watch over the next few.
-Okay.

25:32.875 --> 25:36.000
[Eva] If it continues like this,
we might have to call in backup.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.208
We might have to transfer.

25:37.291 --> 25:39.083
-To the hospital?
-To the hospital.

25:39.166 --> 25:42.041
But I'm watching, okay?
You can go back in there with her.

25:42.125 --> 25:44.208
-I'll be right there.
-We're okay, though?

25:46.250 --> 25:48.583
Yeah. We're good. Go on.

25:50.041 --> 25:52.791
[Martha groaning loudly]

25:52.875 --> 25:56.333
-Baby? Listen to me.
-Where's my mother?

25:56.416 --> 25:58.125
-Listen to me.
-Yeah, what?

25:58.208 --> 25:59.500
You're doing great.

25:59.583 --> 26:03.083
You're pushing great. You're doing a lot.
You've been pushing for a while.

26:03.166 --> 26:05.791
We've come a long way. It's not a failure
if we go to the hospital.

26:05.875 --> 26:08.375
No, get me the chair.
I'm not going to the hospital.

26:08.458 --> 26:09.708
-If she says--
-You can't decide.

26:09.791 --> 26:12.041
-[Eva] Martha? Hey, Martha.
-I'm gonna do it here.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.833
-She's coming out. Just give me a second.
-Listen. Listen.

26:14.916 --> 26:17.375
You need to get this baby out now.

26:17.458 --> 26:21.208
On this contraction. So you push
with everything you've got, okay?

26:21.291 --> 26:22.291
[Martha groaning]

26:22.375 --> 26:23.958
There you go. Okay.

26:25.041 --> 26:28.458
Okay. Come on, I can see her head.
I can see her head.

26:28.541 --> 26:31.500
Okay. Keep pushing. Push, push, push.

26:31.583 --> 26:32.916
Push!

26:34.208 --> 26:35.291
Push, Martha.

26:36.708 --> 26:39.916
-Wait. Please. Come.
-[Eva] Okay.

26:41.833 --> 26:44.166
Okay. Let's just see how we're doing.

26:46.333 --> 26:47.333
Come on.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.583
Okay, you need to call them. Call 911.

26:52.666 --> 26:56.041
Tell them we have a home delivery
and the baby's in distress.

26:56.125 --> 26:57.791
-Okay.
-[Martha] What do you mean?

26:57.875 --> 27:00.208
[Eva] Martha, we need
to get this baby out now.

27:00.291 --> 27:01.416
Where's the phone at?

27:01.500 --> 27:04.708
[Eva] Okay? We're gonna do it right now.
You get up now.

27:16.333 --> 27:17.791
Hi, I'm at 423 Formosa.

27:17.875 --> 27:21.333
I need somebody to send an ambulance
to a house for a home birth.

27:22.416 --> 27:25.083
I'm in the middle of a home birth.
I'm at 423 Formosa.

27:25.750 --> 27:27.083
Yes, please. Thank you.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.791
-Okay.
-[Martha] I'm trying!

27:29.875 --> 27:33.750
We're gonna push this baby out right now.
Take a deep breath and push.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.083
-Push, baby.
-[Eva] Push.

27:35.166 --> 27:37.083
-[Martha groaning]
-[Eva] Push!

27:39.333 --> 27:41.208
Take another breath and keep pushing!

27:41.875 --> 27:44.041
Come on! Come on, come on.

27:46.875 --> 27:48.416
-Push, Martha!
-[Sean] Push!

27:48.500 --> 27:51.791
Hey, no relaxing! Take a breath.
Push. Push this baby out.

27:51.875 --> 27:53.833
-[Martha] Okay.
-[Eva] Do it now!

27:53.916 --> 27:54.916
Come on!

27:56.875 --> 27:57.708
Come on!

27:58.541 --> 28:01.083
Come on, keep pushing! Okay.

28:02.625 --> 28:04.833
There we go!

28:04.916 --> 28:07.791
[Eva] Okay, here she comes!
Here she comes! Here she comes!

28:07.875 --> 28:09.291
Come on, baby!

28:09.375 --> 28:11.000
Come on! Yeah.

28:11.750 --> 28:14.208
Okay! Okay, okay.

28:14.291 --> 28:15.291
Hi!

28:15.375 --> 28:16.750
[Martha] Hi, baby.

28:17.458 --> 28:19.791
[Eva] Good girl. Come on.
How're you doing?

28:20.583 --> 28:22.666
Come on. Let's hear you.

28:22.750 --> 28:25.166
[Martha] She's so quiet. Oh, my God.

28:25.250 --> 28:27.500
-[Eva] Hold on, you guys. Wait! Wait.
-[baby cries briefly]

28:27.583 --> 28:28.833
[Eva] Wait, wait, wait.

28:28.916 --> 28:31.458
-[baby crying loudly]
-[Eva] Okay. Hey!

28:32.916 --> 28:35.791
Okay, she sounds good.
She does. She sounds really good.

28:35.875 --> 28:38.041
And the color's good.

28:38.125 --> 28:41.833
Hey! Hi, darling,
you're gonna go see your mama?

28:41.916 --> 28:43.875
-[Martha] She's so perfect.
-[Sean laughing]

28:43.958 --> 28:45.416
[Eva] Okay!

28:45.500 --> 28:48.125
[Martha] Hi, sweetie!

28:48.208 --> 28:50.916
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-[baby continues crying]

28:52.166 --> 28:54.000
[Martha laughing]

28:55.250 --> 28:56.916
Your eyes are so pretty.

28:58.083 --> 28:58.958
Hi, baby.

28:59.708 --> 29:00.916
I know.

29:01.916 --> 29:03.958
[Eva] I'm just gonna cover her up a bit.

29:05.208 --> 29:06.708
Hi, beautiful.

29:08.000 --> 29:09.666
-[Eva] You did it.
-[Martha] She's perfect.

29:09.750 --> 29:11.708
Oh, look it! Oh, look it!

29:14.916 --> 29:16.416
[breathing shakily]

29:16.500 --> 29:18.375
-[Sean] She's a beauty.
-Oh, my God.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.291
[Martha] It's all right, sweetie.

29:20.375 --> 29:21.583
[Sean] She's so calm.

29:23.750 --> 29:26.375
[Martha] You're the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

29:26.458 --> 29:27.875
[baby struggling to breathe]

29:28.833 --> 29:31.500
You're the most beautiful thing
in the world.

29:32.500 --> 29:33.333
Hi!

29:34.291 --> 29:37.166
Hello. My daughter.

29:37.833 --> 29:40.208
I need to take her. She's blue.

29:40.291 --> 29:41.500
[Martha and Sean] What?

29:42.083 --> 29:43.708
-[Eva] Come on.
-[Martha] What do you mean?

29:43.791 --> 29:46.000
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.041
No!

29:47.125 --> 29:48.208
Come on.

29:48.291 --> 29:50.375
-Come on, baby.
-What do you mean?

29:50.958 --> 29:52.041
[Eva] Come on.

29:52.916 --> 29:56.625
-Okay. Come on, baby. Come on.
-[ambulance siren wails in distance]

29:56.708 --> 29:59.208
Get them in here.
Get them in here right now.

29:59.291 --> 30:01.166
-Come on, baby!
-[burst of air gusting]

30:01.250 --> 30:03.375
Come on, breathe! Come on.

30:03.958 --> 30:05.083
Come on, little girl.

30:05.166 --> 30:06.833
[sirens wailing]

30:08.375 --> 30:09.791
We're here!

30:09.875 --> 30:10.875
Here!

30:11.541 --> 30:13.416
Stop! Hey!

30:14.958 --> 30:15.958
Come on!

31:30.000 --> 31:32.541
[indistinct chatter]

32:06.291 --> 32:08.083
[indistinct murmurs]

32:34.583 --> 32:36.541
Hi, I'm sorry. This is my desk.

32:37.500 --> 32:38.333
Oh.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.791
Am I that scary?

32:40.875 --> 32:42.791
No, no, not at all.

32:42.875 --> 32:45.541
I just… Just was, uh…

32:46.250 --> 32:48.583
It's just my time off has run out.
So, if you don't mind.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.291
Okay. Oh, God. Gee, yeah.
Leaving right now.

32:51.375 --> 32:53.000
-Don't worry about it.
-Thank you.

32:53.083 --> 32:54.625
I'm really sorry about that.

32:54.708 --> 32:56.875
[chuckling nervously] Just grab my stuff.

32:58.250 --> 32:59.875
Really sorry again about that.

33:06.208 --> 33:08.875
[woman] We don't take the time
to do things anymore.

33:08.958 --> 33:12.708
We don't take the time to eat,
to appreciate life.

33:12.791 --> 33:16.458
I have a rule that there are
no smartphones near me when I eat.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.916
[song playing softly over speakers]

35:19.708 --> 35:20.750
[sniffs]

35:25.583 --> 35:26.708
[Judith] Martha, is that you?

35:26.791 --> 35:29.416
Don't you recognize me?
I'm a friend of your mom's.

35:30.250 --> 35:32.083
-[Martha] Oh, yes.
-We play bridge together.

35:32.166 --> 35:35.291
-Of course, yes.
-Right. And how-- how are you?

35:35.375 --> 35:37.541
-I'm good. Yeah.
-Yeah? Yeah.

35:38.166 --> 35:41.458
You know,
your mom tells me absolutely everything.

35:41.541 --> 35:44.666
I know everything, yeah.

35:45.791 --> 35:47.583
Gosh, it's so horrible.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.333
It's all that swindler's fault.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.375
She will surely rot in prison. I promise.

35:55.208 --> 35:57.333
There will be consequences.

36:01.375 --> 36:03.375
[indistinct]

36:22.000 --> 36:23.166
Nice shirt.

36:24.416 --> 36:25.458
Thank you.

36:26.166 --> 36:27.291
You're welcome.

36:32.708 --> 36:34.000
Put your seat belt on.

36:34.833 --> 36:36.208
[seat belt clicks]

36:38.708 --> 36:40.708
-Want some music?
-No.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.250
Penny for your thoughts.

36:59.291 --> 37:00.208
None.

37:00.916 --> 37:03.708
Martha, there's something.
I know you're worried.

37:06.708 --> 37:09.833
About this.
Worried what they're gonna find.

37:10.833 --> 37:12.500
-What they're gonna find?
-Yeah.

37:13.416 --> 37:15.291
[Martha] A glass of wine
before we fucked?

37:17.291 --> 37:18.583
Or that I had sushi?

37:32.708 --> 37:35.833
Or do you mean, uh… like your stuff?

37:38.708 --> 37:39.708
[Sean] My stuff.

37:40.708 --> 37:43.041
My… Like my sobriety?

37:45.083 --> 37:48.291
Yeah, I mean, well,
it's not even been like, what, like…

37:48.375 --> 37:50.083
-Long time.
-Mm-hmm.

37:50.750 --> 37:52.708
Six years, five months, three days.

37:53.916 --> 37:54.916
Four days.

37:55.916 --> 37:56.916
Four days.

38:02.666 --> 38:04.875
[man] We don't have theories
regarding the cause of death.

38:04.958 --> 38:07.375
During the criminal autopsy,

38:07.458 --> 38:10.041
we ran histology, toxicology
and microbiology screens.

38:10.125 --> 38:12.625
The results of the exam show no signs
of a preexisting infection,

38:12.708 --> 38:15.291
chromosomal abnormality
or irregularity of the placenta.

38:15.375 --> 38:18.875
What we did determine was the little girl
was in a low-oxygen environment.

38:18.958 --> 38:22.958
In 60% to 70% of these cases,
we rarely find a satisfactory explanation.

38:23.041 --> 38:25.666
-You're a doctor, yeah? What's your name?
-Dr. Ron.

38:25.750 --> 38:29.958
Dr. Ron. You're a doctor, Dr. Ron.
[laughing] You're a fucking doctor.

38:30.041 --> 38:33.416
[Dr. Ron] There are certain things,
medically, we just don't have answers for.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.833
There's already proceedings
against the midwife

38:35.916 --> 38:39.250
and there will be a medical expert opinion
very soon to determine--

38:39.333 --> 38:42.666
What about your medical expert opinion?
You're a medical expert.

38:44.500 --> 38:46.625
I mean, what do you--
You don't know anything.

38:46.708 --> 38:49.083
If it could have been prevented,
who's at fault.

38:49.166 --> 38:51.041
You don't know shit is what you're saying.

38:51.125 --> 38:53.125
[Dr. Ron] There are certain questions
I can't answer.

38:53.208 --> 38:55.583
What can you answer at the moment?
Right now?

38:57.416 --> 39:00.458
[Dr. Ron] What is certain is that
the proceedings have begun and there--

39:00.541 --> 39:01.583
Fuck!

39:08.291 --> 39:10.250
Uh, sorry.

39:13.000 --> 39:13.958
[sniffling]

39:15.291 --> 39:17.375
I'm gonna go outside. Sorry.

39:27.625 --> 39:29.125
[Dr. Ron] These things could take time.

39:29.208 --> 39:30.541
[Martha] Where is she now?

39:32.041 --> 39:34.250
-[Dr. Ron] She's in the morgue.
-[Sean sniffling]

39:35.875 --> 39:37.833
Is it possible to donate the organs?

39:39.125 --> 39:43.041
No. The criminal medical expert
has excluded that.

39:44.625 --> 39:46.000
Oh.

39:46.083 --> 39:47.250
Some decide to…

39:48.458 --> 39:49.541
offer the body…

39:50.833 --> 39:53.083
for medical science
and educational purposes.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.541
Very sorry for your loss.

39:59.833 --> 40:00.833
Thank you.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.250
-[Martha] What do I owe you?
-[driver] Twenty-five dollars.

40:38.333 --> 40:40.666
[Martha] Twenty-five.
There you go. Thank you.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.125
-[driver] Thank you.
-[Martha] Bye.

40:52.666 --> 40:55.958
[Elizabeth] You need to pick
which inscription you like, honey.

40:56.041 --> 40:59.500
Your grandmother is resting
in the family grave.

40:59.583 --> 41:01.750
-What's wrong with--
-Did you write that?

41:03.166 --> 41:04.416
[man] Yes.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.041
-You wrote that?
-[man] Yes.

41:06.833 --> 41:09.083
That isn't my daughter's name.
It's Yvette.

41:09.166 --> 41:11.000
Starts with a "Y," ends with an "E."

41:11.750 --> 41:13.000
"Yvette."

41:13.083 --> 41:14.041
[man] I'm sorry.

41:14.125 --> 41:16.916
Don't blame him. Sean dictated it to him.

41:17.000 --> 41:19.208
Yeah, great-grandmother,
Hungarian spelling.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.333
So it's not at the end
of the name list forever.

41:21.416 --> 41:23.083
[Martha] That doesn't make
any sense at all

41:23.166 --> 41:25.000
because name lists are by last name.

41:25.583 --> 41:28.666
And we chose
the American spelling for you.

41:28.750 --> 41:30.791
[Sean] Yeah,
but it's a small detail, Martha.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.166
-Small detail.
-[Sean] Yeah.

41:37.375 --> 41:38.375
Yeah.

41:39.416 --> 41:40.416
Yeah, you're right.

41:41.458 --> 41:43.666
No, it is a small detail.

41:43.750 --> 41:47.833
Small detail. 'Cause there's not…
There's not gonna be a funeral anyway…

41:47.916 --> 41:50.791
-There's not gonna be a funeral.
-[Sean] I didn't mean it like that.

41:50.875 --> 41:54.000
-[Martha] Not gonna be a gravestone.
-[Sean] Martha? I'll change the spelling.

41:54.083 --> 41:57.458
-Can you at least pick which style?
-[Martha] It's all one big waste of time.

41:58.458 --> 41:59.458
What?

42:00.208 --> 42:01.208
[Elizabeth] Martha.

42:02.916 --> 42:03.750
Martha!

42:03.833 --> 42:05.958
-Can you just pick a style today?
-[Anita] Martha!

42:06.041 --> 42:08.208
There's really no point.
I'm gonna donate her body

42:08.291 --> 42:09.750
to the university, so…

42:09.833 --> 42:10.916
This is just like…

42:12.250 --> 42:13.458
[Anita] Martha!

42:13.541 --> 42:15.458
[Martha muttering] Complete waste of time.

42:16.625 --> 42:18.125
Martha! Come on!

42:20.791 --> 42:22.125
Oh.

42:22.208 --> 42:23.458
Can I have one?

42:23.541 --> 42:24.625
Please, go ahead.

42:25.958 --> 42:30.916
Just… keep the order
and we'll make a few small changes

42:31.000 --> 42:32.125
and I'll pay for it.

42:32.208 --> 42:33.708
No, I'd like to pay for it.

42:35.125 --> 42:36.291
I'd like to pay for it.

42:37.708 --> 42:38.750
Thank you.

42:39.291 --> 42:40.958
There's some stuff I can pay for.

42:46.791 --> 42:50.000
[Elizabeth] Sean, don't smoke it.
You'll relapse.

42:51.375 --> 42:53.458
-Sean, where are you going?
-[Sean] Five minutes.

42:54.750 --> 42:55.750
Fuck.

42:58.875 --> 42:59.875
[Elizabeth] Sean.

43:01.833 --> 43:02.833
[Sean clears throat]

43:08.166 --> 43:09.791
[Elizabeth] She needs help.

43:09.875 --> 43:11.833
She doesn't know what she's doing.

43:11.916 --> 43:15.125
I mean, she's just
piling mistake upon mistake.

43:16.125 --> 43:17.125
[Elizabeth sighs]

43:17.208 --> 43:20.541
That's why it's our job
to show her what's right.

43:21.750 --> 43:22.750
What does that mean?

43:24.750 --> 43:26.791
You know Suzanne, right? Her cousin?

43:27.625 --> 43:29.041
-No.
-No?

43:29.125 --> 43:31.166
Well, she's just a remarkable girl.

43:32.208 --> 43:34.666
She has a beautiful office downtown.

43:34.750 --> 43:39.500
She said that she will take on
and handle a civil suit for us,

43:40.500 --> 43:43.291
if I put all
the documentation in her hands.

43:43.375 --> 43:46.208
-You want me to give you the paperwork.
-Exactly.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.125
Mm.

43:50.125 --> 43:52.541
Yeah, I gotta talk
to Martha about that first.

43:54.125 --> 43:55.125
Really?

43:55.750 --> 43:59.125
My-- Don't you want someone
to answer for this monstrosity?

43:59.208 --> 44:02.166
Martha can't sort through all of this now.

44:03.500 --> 44:04.583
That's why I thought

44:05.583 --> 44:08.666
maybe you might take
a little responsibility for a change.

44:08.750 --> 44:09.625
[Sean scoffs]

44:09.708 --> 44:10.875
Well, really.

44:13.458 --> 44:16.458
Yeah, I'd like to hand it
to her myself, if you don't mind.

44:17.625 --> 44:18.625
When?

44:20.333 --> 44:21.333
Soon.

44:22.291 --> 44:23.458
Well, you better.

44:25.625 --> 44:28.833
Let me out at the next corner.
I wanna walk the rest of the way.

44:31.000 --> 44:32.916
You don't want me to take you to the door?

44:33.875 --> 44:36.333
No, I feel like I need a little air.

45:11.541 --> 45:12.833
[door opens]

45:26.916 --> 45:27.916
Hi.

45:29.625 --> 45:30.583
[Sean] Hey.

45:40.791 --> 45:41.875
[Martha] Are you smoking?

45:41.958 --> 45:42.958
Sorry.

46:01.041 --> 46:02.458
-Good day?
-Yeah.

46:03.541 --> 46:05.541
-You?
-Yeah, it was good.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.875
[Sean] We should talk
about a civil case, Martha.

46:17.666 --> 46:18.916
We gotta finish this.

46:19.000 --> 46:22.000
You know, I've come back
from death before. Dark, cold.

46:22.083 --> 46:23.458
Really dark, really cold.

46:23.541 --> 46:27.416
And now she's in the dark and the cold
and I can't do anything about it.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.333
My hands are sort of tied here.

46:30.166 --> 46:31.541
Please, Martha.

46:54.250 --> 46:56.083
I'm not your mother.

46:56.166 --> 46:58.166
I'm your partner, yeah?
It's a team thing.

46:58.250 --> 46:59.875
Can we please talk, Martha?

47:03.625 --> 47:04.625
Martha?

47:06.625 --> 47:07.708
Please come out.

47:19.250 --> 47:20.500
[crying] I miss her.

47:29.500 --> 47:31.958
I miss her. Please, Martha.

47:38.583 --> 47:42.458
I'm sorry. I just need you
to promise me you won't…

47:44.708 --> 47:46.250
You can't send her anywhere.

47:49.833 --> 47:50.833
Please.

47:54.666 --> 47:55.666
Promise me.

47:58.666 --> 47:59.666
I promise.

48:41.333 --> 48:43.000
[indistinct chatter]

49:02.625 --> 49:05.000
[Elizabeth] Sean told me
I might find you here.

49:05.083 --> 49:06.583
He's beside himself.

49:07.375 --> 49:08.875
You two best friends now?

49:09.625 --> 49:12.041
[Elizabeth] Well, there are things
we agree on.

49:12.125 --> 49:13.625
Does he have a choice in that?

49:14.500 --> 49:17.625
Martha, wait a minute. Martha, please.

49:17.708 --> 49:21.083
I'm not trying to change your mind.
I know I can't do that.

49:21.166 --> 49:26.083
I understand that you made up your mind
to give your baby for medical research.

49:27.083 --> 49:31.500
The only thing I'm asking of you
is that when it's all over…

49:31.583 --> 49:34.583
that we get her back so we can bury her.

49:36.291 --> 49:39.041
That's all.
That's the right thing to do, honey.

49:39.125 --> 49:41.875
Because you say it is? Yeah.

49:41.958 --> 49:45.916
Do you really wanna put
your little baby's body on a mass grave

49:46.000 --> 49:47.458
like an animal?

49:47.541 --> 49:49.083
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

49:49.166 --> 49:50.625
[Elizabeth] That's funny to you?

49:50.708 --> 49:52.875
Yeah. So cheap.

49:54.916 --> 49:56.750
-[Elizabeth] Martha.
-Mm-hmm.

50:22.708 --> 50:23.833
Thank you for waiting.

50:25.000 --> 50:25.833
Okay.

50:27.625 --> 50:29.708
There you go. Sign here.

50:34.000 --> 50:34.916
Yep.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.416
And a signature here as well.

50:43.458 --> 50:46.125
There's one more at the bottom as well.

51:19.000 --> 51:20.333
[keypad beeping]

51:20.416 --> 51:21.875
[door buzzes open]

51:25.916 --> 51:28.458
[Sean] Hello. Looking for Suzanne Weiss.

51:28.541 --> 51:30.458
[woman] Yes,
go straight down to your left.

51:30.541 --> 51:31.500
Thank you.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.625
[indistinct chatter]

51:42.833 --> 51:45.083
-[Suzanne] And who's this?
-[receptionist] Your 5:30.

51:45.166 --> 51:46.416
Oh. Hey.

51:46.500 --> 51:47.875
-[Sean] Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

51:47.958 --> 51:48.875
I'm Sean.

51:49.625 --> 51:52.791
-Yeah, Carson, right?
-Carson, yeah. Elizabeth.

51:52.875 --> 51:53.958
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

51:54.500 --> 51:56.416
Uh, you wanna come in?

51:56.500 --> 51:58.000
-Yeah.
-Okay.

51:59.041 --> 52:01.458
-[Sean] Am I catching you at a good time?
-Huh?

52:01.541 --> 52:04.166
Oh. I forgot my paperwork.
I'll be right back.

52:09.583 --> 52:12.791
-Yeah, you know, we're related.
-Yeah, I guess we are.

52:12.875 --> 52:13.958
Strange.

52:20.583 --> 52:22.333
[indistinct chatter]

52:49.791 --> 52:51.416
[children giggling, chattering]

54:03.083 --> 54:05.333
[Sean] Why are you trying
to disappear my kid?

54:07.416 --> 54:09.166
We don't need this room, so…

54:11.958 --> 54:13.416
Because we don't have a kid.

54:15.916 --> 54:18.166
-Why are you being so cold to me?
-Cold?

54:18.250 --> 54:19.125
[Sean] Yeah.

54:19.750 --> 54:20.625
I'm cold?

54:21.750 --> 54:23.125
-[Sean] You're cold.
-Right.

54:23.875 --> 54:25.416
Well… [chuckles]

54:26.166 --> 54:29.333
you're the one teaming up
with my mother behind my back, so…

54:47.291 --> 54:49.000
Can you please leave that alone?

54:49.625 --> 54:53.000
-Martha, I wanna put it back up.
-Mm-hmm.

54:53.083 --> 54:54.583
Can you give me the picture?

54:54.666 --> 54:56.166
[glass shatters]

54:59.666 --> 55:01.125
[Martha sighs] Stop it.

55:05.458 --> 55:06.458
Fuck.

55:21.916 --> 55:23.208
How's your hand?

55:36.833 --> 55:38.041
[footsteps approaching]

55:41.125 --> 55:42.500
You don't want this apple?

55:44.375 --> 55:45.416
Huh?

55:45.500 --> 55:46.541
It's brown.

55:47.416 --> 55:49.750
-Yeah, I don't want it.
-Okay.

55:55.791 --> 55:57.291
What are you thinking about?

55:57.375 --> 55:58.291
[Martha] Huh?

55:59.458 --> 56:01.041
[Sean] Penny for your thoughts.

56:02.958 --> 56:04.583
[Martha] I'm just thinking about my hand.

56:05.166 --> 56:07.083
-[Sean] How is it?
-[Martha] Fine.

56:09.166 --> 56:12.166
Yeah, I'm thinking about going
to Seattle for a little while.

56:13.416 --> 56:14.958
-[Martha] Seattle?
-Yeah.

56:15.875 --> 56:18.625
Like a road trip.
You could come with me. We could--

56:19.541 --> 56:21.500
-We could road trip.
-Mm.

56:23.125 --> 56:26.291
We could get a cheap little--
a little beater on some land,

56:26.375 --> 56:29.375
and I got friends out there
that'd help me renovate.

56:30.083 --> 56:31.750
It'd be good for us, Martha.

56:32.500 --> 56:36.000
It'd be so good for us. Good for you,
good for me, good change of scenery.

56:36.083 --> 56:37.125
I mean…

56:38.125 --> 56:38.958
[Martha] Mm…

56:41.708 --> 56:43.208
[Sean] Come on, let's go.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.125
I think we should go.

56:57.666 --> 56:58.750
I miss you.

57:06.916 --> 57:08.500
-Touch me.
-Come on!

57:09.166 --> 57:11.416
-Touch me.
-Sean. Ow!

57:11.500 --> 57:12.541
I miss you.

57:16.041 --> 57:17.041
It's okay.

57:24.208 --> 57:25.250
[Martha moans]

57:26.291 --> 57:27.541
[Sean whispers] Touch me.

57:35.625 --> 57:38.833
Touch me. Touch me.

57:45.083 --> 57:46.166
[Martha groans] Okay…

57:57.250 --> 57:58.333
[Sean] Take this off.

58:01.958 --> 58:03.708
The clip at the back.

58:10.500 --> 58:11.750
[clattering]

58:11.833 --> 58:14.916
Sean! Don't rip it like that. Just…

58:15.500 --> 58:16.750
-Take it off.
-You're gonna…

58:19.666 --> 58:21.541
[both moaning]

58:27.833 --> 58:30.291
Sean. Would you just let me take them…

58:30.875 --> 58:32.375
Let me take them off!

58:32.458 --> 58:34.208
-[Sean] Come here.
-[Martha] Come on!

58:34.291 --> 58:35.208
Stop it!

58:38.541 --> 58:39.625
Listen to me.

58:40.583 --> 58:42.958
I'll take them off
if you just give me a second.

58:43.833 --> 58:44.958
Fuck, man!

58:47.083 --> 58:49.750
Here. Sorry. Let me just… One second.

58:49.833 --> 58:51.791
Fuck it. I don't want to now.

58:54.458 --> 58:58.083
[pants jangling]

59:08.750 --> 59:09.875
[sobbing]

59:10.958 --> 59:12.750
[muttering indistinctly]

59:29.541 --> 59:31.000
[screams]

1:00:15.583 --> 1:00:17.958
[Sean] Hey, Chris. Hey, man. Um…

1:00:18.041 --> 1:00:19.666
Oh, man, I'm so sorry.

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:21.833
[Sean] Yeah, it's all right… No, wait…

1:00:21.916 --> 1:00:24.583
I literally have no idea.
I can't even imagine what's--

1:00:24.666 --> 1:00:26.458
[Sean] Yeah. Hey, I need you to--

1:00:27.291 --> 1:00:31.000
I need you to switch the car out for me.
And give me the money for the car.

1:00:31.083 --> 1:00:32.708
And then you sell it after.

1:00:33.708 --> 1:00:35.500
-Yeah?
-I can help you sell it.

1:00:35.583 --> 1:00:37.291
It'll take a couple of months, but…

1:00:37.375 --> 1:00:39.666
No, I need it now.
I'm sort of underwater now.

1:00:39.750 --> 1:00:40.916
My hands are tied.

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.250
As soon as that car goes out,
I can't do anything.

1:00:43.333 --> 1:00:47.041
But I haven't driven it for six months.
It's just sort of the same car.

1:00:47.125 --> 1:00:49.333
-I get it…
-Chris, I need it.

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:51.625
My boss totally-- Okay.

1:00:51.708 --> 1:00:53.500
[Sean] I need you to do it now, man.

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:55.000
-[Chris] All right.
-[Sean] Sorry.

1:00:55.791 --> 1:01:00.166
[Chris clears throat] Well, there is--
I could make it if it--

1:01:00.708 --> 1:01:02.500
Is the car dangerous?

1:01:03.041 --> 1:01:05.625
Is there-- Is it-- Is there a problem--

1:01:05.708 --> 1:01:08.083
-[Sean] If the car's dangerous--
-Then I can take it back.

1:01:08.166 --> 1:01:09.500
[Sean] How do we make that happen?

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:12.333
If there was an accident,
I can figure out a way to make it work.

1:01:12.416 --> 1:01:13.666
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

1:01:13.750 --> 1:01:15.458
[jazz music playing softly]

1:01:56.375 --> 1:01:58.375
[man] Looking for something
about sprouting?

1:01:58.458 --> 1:01:59.291
Mm-hmm.

1:01:59.375 --> 1:02:01.083
I've got a better book than that.

1:02:08.083 --> 1:02:09.041
Try this.

1:02:10.541 --> 1:02:12.125
No, this one. Yeah.

1:02:22.125 --> 1:02:24.666
-Thank you.
-[man] You're welcome.

1:02:26.833 --> 1:02:28.583
[jazz music continues]

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.125
[Martha sighs]

1:03:00.333 --> 1:03:02.916
[humming]

1:03:08.125 --> 1:03:08.958

[doorbell rings]

1:03:49.416 --> 1:03:50.875
[doorbell rings]

1:04:08.291 --> 1:04:09.125
Hi.

1:04:10.458 --> 1:04:12.416
[Anita] We've gotta talk
about Mom's condition.

1:04:12.500 --> 1:04:15.708
She's aged five years in three months.
She almost burned the house down.

1:04:15.791 --> 1:04:16.791
Is it my fault?

1:04:17.875 --> 1:04:19.875
It doesn't help
that you don't answer the phone

1:04:19.958 --> 1:04:21.791
when she calls to say
the house is on fire.

1:04:21.875 --> 1:04:23.583
So she sent you to meet me, right?

1:04:24.875 --> 1:04:26.916
I don't know why you guys
do this through me.

1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:28.916
Every time she calls, I'm in a meeting--

1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000
-I thought you quit.
-[Martha] What?

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:33.708
-Chris said you quit.
-I haven't spoken to Chris.

1:04:33.791 --> 1:04:36.208
Sean spoke to Chris
when he returned the car.

1:04:36.291 --> 1:04:37.208
[Martha] What?

1:04:38.083 --> 1:04:38.916
Um…

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:42.708
This is yours. And…

1:04:43.666 --> 1:04:45.833
-[Martha] That's not mine.
-[Anita] It was in the car.

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:48.041
Also found a roll of film.

1:04:49.041 --> 1:04:50.875
-I got these printed for you.
-Oh.

1:04:51.500 --> 1:04:53.916
I've gotta go. I got a work thing. Bye.

1:04:55.416 --> 1:04:57.208
-I love you.
-Love you.

1:05:07.041 --> 1:05:08.083
[Sean clears throat]

1:05:18.916 --> 1:05:20.500
[exhales]

1:05:22.625 --> 1:05:24.708
You know, I wouldn't worry about it.

1:05:27.041 --> 1:05:29.833
People wanna kill this woman.
With the mistake she's made,

1:05:29.916 --> 1:05:32.541
the case is practically won
with two to eight years imprisonment.

1:05:33.333 --> 1:05:37.416
The gross negligence on not calling
an ambulance in time to a dying baby

1:05:37.500 --> 1:05:39.291
should be enough to put her away.

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:40.208
All right.

1:05:41.375 --> 1:05:44.041
[Suzanne] And as your criminal lawyer,
with your testimony,

1:05:44.125 --> 1:05:45.958
we have this case in the bag.

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:49.333
If you guys decide to slap her
with a civil case as well,

1:05:49.416 --> 1:05:52.125
I can get someone to handle that,
someone that I trust.

1:05:52.708 --> 1:05:54.875
I feel like you got
a good shot at winning both.

1:05:54.958 --> 1:05:57.583
And you could win millions.

1:06:02.583 --> 1:06:03.708
You know about this bridge?

1:06:05.208 --> 1:06:06.083
Huh?

1:06:07.250 --> 1:06:08.875
This bridge you got on the wall.

1:06:09.750 --> 1:06:12.250
-No.
-There's a big story behind this bridge.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:13.750
[Suzanne] Uh-huh.

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:17.125
In the '40s, this thing
just disintegrates into the floor.

1:06:17.208 --> 1:06:20.166
It's a big deal.
It's the third biggest bridge in the US.

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:23.291
You got the Golden Gate, George Washington
and then you got the Tacoma.

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:27.333
In the '40s, things collapse
and they can't figure it out

1:06:27.416 --> 1:06:28.791
and they bring in these experts.

1:06:28.875 --> 1:06:31.500
Mathematicians, scientists,
nobody could figure it out.

1:06:31.583 --> 1:06:34.375
Took a look at foundations,
suspension wire, nothing.

1:06:34.458 --> 1:06:35.666
Everything checks out.

1:06:36.375 --> 1:06:39.208
Then finally,
one of these scientists says "resonance."

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:40.375
What?

1:06:40.458 --> 1:06:42.541
-[Sean] Resonance. You know what that is?
-[zips coat]

1:06:42.625 --> 1:06:44.875
-No.
-[Sean] Resonance is, um…

1:06:45.958 --> 1:06:48.333
You know, every solid object
has its own vibration.

1:06:49.875 --> 1:06:53.041
When the outer one matches
the inner one, you get resonance.

1:06:54.041 --> 1:06:58.875
Sometimes, resonance can be so powerful,
it can bring a whole bridge down.

1:06:59.958 --> 1:07:00.875
[sniffs]

1:07:01.625 --> 1:07:03.208
[exhales and sniffles]

1:07:03.291 --> 1:07:06.333
-Does it happen often?
-No, like, um…

1:07:06.416 --> 1:07:09.166
Like when swings move
by themselves at the playground?

1:07:09.250 --> 1:07:11.666
That's resonance. Thank you.

1:07:14.375 --> 1:07:15.333
For everything.

1:07:17.375 --> 1:07:18.875
-Here to help.
-Yeah.

1:17:04.916 --> 1:17:06.000
And I was like, "Yeah."

1:17:07.708 --> 1:17:08.958
"That's pretty good."

1:17:09.041 --> 1:17:11.333
[Sean] What are you doing with your time?
You still playing?

1:17:11.416 --> 1:17:16.750
[Chris] Uh, no, it's been a while.
Uh, I'm just working.

1:17:16.833 --> 1:17:19.875
The only type of playing I do
is if they pay me over there, so…

1:17:19.958 --> 1:17:21.375
-[Sean] At the church?
-[Chris] Yep.

1:17:21.458 --> 1:17:23.625
-Well, that's exciting.
-[Chris chuckles]

1:17:24.125 --> 1:17:26.541
-Different scene, that's for sure.
-Different scene.

1:17:26.625 --> 1:17:27.541
[Chris] Worshipers.

1:17:27.625 --> 1:17:30.833
Yeah. Oh, you get that.
Better than a groupie.

1:17:31.500 --> 1:17:33.333
-Kinda the same thing.
-[Chris] That's true.

1:17:33.416 --> 1:17:35.416
-[Sean] It was a good band, man.
-[Chris] Thank you.

1:17:35.500 --> 1:17:36.833
[Sean] Good time to be in a band.

1:17:36.916 --> 1:17:37.750
[Chris] It was.

1:17:37.833 --> 1:17:40.083
-[Sean] That whole grunge revival scene.
-[Chris] Oh, man.

1:17:40.166 --> 1:17:42.666
It's crazy. When you had
the White Stripes, right?

1:17:42.750 --> 1:17:45.583
-[Sean] Stripes were there. Who else?
-[Chris] Mm-hmm. They had the Hives.

1:17:45.666 --> 1:17:48.000
[Sean] Hives, Strokes, Beck.

1:17:48.083 --> 1:17:51.333
Nah, Beck is different. He's softer.
You guys had a grit. Harder.

1:17:51.416 --> 1:17:52.958
[Chris] Um, what was it the Stripes did?

1:17:53.041 --> 1:17:55.166
-[Sean] You need help?
-[Chris] Stripes were like, um…

1:17:55.250 --> 1:17:56.125
[Anita] Huh?

1:17:56.208 --> 1:17:58.916
-[Sean] Help?
-[Anita] No. I just had another glass.

1:17:59.750 --> 1:18:01.375
What was it? They were brother--

1:18:01.458 --> 1:18:03.666
They were husband-- They were brother--

1:18:03.750 --> 1:18:06.041
They were pretending
to be brother and sister,

1:18:06.125 --> 1:18:07.333
or to be husband and wife.

1:18:07.416 --> 1:18:08.583
-[Sean] Stripes?
-Stripes, yes.

1:18:08.666 --> 1:18:09.750
[Sean] There was this thing.

1:18:09.833 --> 1:18:10.750
-Who are they?
-Smart.

1:18:10.833 --> 1:18:12.750
-[Sean] The White Stripes?
-Are they a band?

1:18:12.833 --> 1:18:13.750
[Chris] You're funny.

1:18:13.833 --> 1:18:16.166
-[Sean] You don't know the White Stripes?
-[Suzanne] No.

1:18:16.250 --> 1:18:17.500
-[Sean] Really?
-[Chris] This is…

1:18:17.583 --> 1:18:19.958
-[Suzanne] No. The White Stripes?
-[Chris] This is insane.

1:18:20.041 --> 1:18:23.000
[Sean] Come on, 2001, 2002,
were you living under a rock?

1:18:23.083 --> 1:18:25.791
[Chris] They did a Coke commercial.
"Seven Nation Army."

1:18:25.875 --> 1:18:27.916
-[Sean] That fucking song, boy.
-[Chris] Yeah.

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:32.166
[Sean and Chris
singing "Seven Nation Army" indistinctly]

1:18:32.250 --> 1:18:34.541
-[Suzanne] Yeah, I know that song.
-[Sean] Yeah.

1:18:34.625 --> 1:18:36.375
-[Suzanne] They play it at the--
-[Chris] Yes.

1:18:36.458 --> 1:18:39.916
[Sean] So, the story with them goes,
there's a two-person band.

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:42.958
-[Chris] Uh-huh.
-Boy and a girl. Boy's name is Jack White.

1:18:43.041 --> 1:18:44.833
-Girl's name is, uh…
-[Martha] Meg.

1:18:44.916 --> 1:18:49.000
Meg. And they're in a band,
but their band is, uh…

1:18:49.083 --> 1:18:50.875
They're in a marriage…

1:18:50.958 --> 1:18:53.833
They're in a marriage, they're telling
people they're brother and sister.

1:18:53.916 --> 1:18:57.125
They're actually married,
falling apart in front of the world.

1:18:57.208 --> 1:18:58.666
[Chris] So, like Sonny and Cher.

1:18:58.750 --> 1:19:02.458
It's like, you look at them,
and everybody's like, "Oh, my God."

1:19:02.541 --> 1:19:05.000
"Are they fighting?"
They're not listening to the music.

1:19:05.083 --> 1:19:06.708
-You're into the gossip.
-[Chris] Exactly.

1:19:06.791 --> 1:19:07.833
Not into the music.

1:19:07.916 --> 1:19:09.625
If you're watching a couple play music,

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:12.750
you're not thinking, "What's up
with the song, this instrumentation?"

1:19:12.833 --> 1:19:16.208
You're thinking, "Are they fucking?
Where'd they meet? Do they got kids?"

1:19:16.291 --> 1:19:17.541
[Chris chuckles] It's terrible.

1:19:17.625 --> 1:19:20.125
You look at Donny and Marie. Opposite.

1:19:20.208 --> 1:19:23.708
[Sean] Yeah, but their music sucked,
so you didn't care either way.

1:19:23.791 --> 1:19:26.125
[Chris] But you didn't wanna think
about anything happening.

1:19:26.208 --> 1:19:28.458
It's true. If they sucked
and they were brother--

1:19:28.541 --> 1:19:30.083
-Yes, so my point.
-[Chris chuckles]

1:19:30.166 --> 1:19:31.666
Hey, so what happened with your band?

1:19:31.750 --> 1:19:33.583
[Chris] Uh, I don't know. So stupid.

1:19:34.125 --> 1:19:35.916
Everybody kind of grew up and moved on.

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:36.833
[soft music playing]

1:19:36.916 --> 1:19:39.583
[Sean] To different bands
or different sounds?

1:19:39.666 --> 1:19:40.791
[Chris] No. It's just…

1:19:40.875 --> 1:19:45.208
It's like, "Okay. Great. You go be a dad.
You don't have time for this."

1:19:45.291 --> 1:19:47.625
-Looking at me like I'm a child.
-[Sean] Rest of the band?

1:19:47.708 --> 1:19:52.041
[Chris] Yeah. I mean, the way
he talked to me, I didn't like that.

1:19:52.125 --> 1:19:53.500
[Sean] Well, he was older than you.

1:19:53.583 --> 1:19:55.750
[Chris] Yeah, but it was
just so condescending.

1:19:55.833 --> 1:20:00.041
Like, "I'm so much better than you
because I have kids."

1:20:00.125 --> 1:20:01.750
Yeah, that wouldn't be right.

1:20:01.833 --> 1:20:03.875
[Chris] Right.
It's like, "What does it matter?"

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:07.375
-It doesn't change your life.
-[Martha] No, to go do that.

1:20:07.458 --> 1:20:10.166
When you're young like that,
on the verge of breaking through.

1:20:10.250 --> 1:20:12.500
-[Martha] No. Makes total sense.
-[Chris] What's that tone?

1:20:12.583 --> 1:20:13.416
I don't understand.

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:14.958
-What's going on?
-[Martha] What tone?

1:20:15.041 --> 1:20:17.875
-Martha, we're just talking.
-[Martha] What? I was agreeing with him.

1:20:17.958 --> 1:20:21.125
[Sean] Yeah, we're agreeing also.
Everybody's agreeing.

1:20:21.208 --> 1:20:23.333
-So what's the problem?
-[Martha] The problem?

1:20:23.416 --> 1:20:25.375
Don't give him a hard time.
We're just talking.

1:20:25.458 --> 1:20:27.458
[Sean] We're just trying to keep it light.

1:20:30.291 --> 1:20:32.416
[Martha] Right. Light.

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:34.000
Yes. I am…

1:20:34.083 --> 1:20:35.666
Okay, okay, okay.

1:20:35.750 --> 1:20:39.000
I am sorry. I did not put that together.

1:20:39.083 --> 1:20:41.666
-"Baby," I didn't know.
-[Martha sighs] Oh, my God.

1:20:41.750 --> 1:20:45.000
What are we even doing here?
This is completely nuts. What the fuck?

1:20:45.083 --> 1:20:47.166
[Elizabeth] Well,
as long as you're asking.

1:20:50.083 --> 1:20:50.916
Um,

1:20:51.833 --> 1:20:56.166
Suzanne-- I've consulted
with her about the--

1:20:56.250 --> 1:20:57.708
-[Martha] About what?
-About the case.

1:20:59.333 --> 1:21:01.166
[Martha] You're the prosecutor
on the case?

1:21:01.250 --> 1:21:05.166
-Yeah.
-Yes. She's an excellent lawyer.

1:21:05.750 --> 1:21:08.000
And she's family, you know?

1:21:08.083 --> 1:21:13.000
She loves us. She's here
to make sure we get the right thing.

1:21:13.083 --> 1:21:16.500
Look, the case is already won.
People hate this woman. So, I'll just…

1:21:16.583 --> 1:21:21.125
Yes, exactly.
And I don't want them to judge you.

1:21:21.208 --> 1:21:23.500
-[Martha] "Them"?
-The people.

1:21:23.583 --> 1:21:27.583
[Martha scoffs] "People."
By "people," you mean Judith?

1:21:27.666 --> 1:21:29.625
-[Chris] I really--
-Fuck off, Chris.

1:21:29.708 --> 1:21:32.375
If you're talking about her,
I went to a store to get an apple.

1:21:32.458 --> 1:21:34.083
Twenty minutes later,
I'm in the same store

1:21:34.166 --> 1:21:35.458
getting the same apple.

1:21:35.541 --> 1:21:39.000
I know because I met him late.
How late, 25 minutes?

1:21:39.083 --> 1:21:41.458
I spent a minute getting an apple.

1:21:41.541 --> 1:21:45.375
The rest of the time, I spent there stuck,
stranded, getting grilled by your friend,

1:21:45.458 --> 1:21:48.083
trying to figure out
what the fuck she wants from me.

1:21:48.750 --> 1:21:51.208
And you're worried about them judging me?

1:21:51.291 --> 1:21:52.166
[Elizabeth] Martha.

1:21:52.250 --> 1:21:54.625
[Martha] It's not even about
them judging me, actually.

1:21:54.708 --> 1:21:57.125
It's about how you want me to be
to fit their opinion.

1:21:57.208 --> 1:21:58.458
You wanna arrange me.

1:21:58.541 --> 1:22:01.333
-[Anita] You need therapy!
-I do not need therapy. Thank you, Anita.

1:22:01.416 --> 1:22:03.041
-[Anita] You do. Asshole.
-All right.

1:22:03.125 --> 1:22:06.416
Who cares about what they think?
This is about me. This is about my body.

1:22:06.500 --> 1:22:08.250
This is me. Do you understand that?

1:22:08.333 --> 1:22:10.166
Yes, I understand that, dear.

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:14.166
But have you decided to go to the trial?

1:22:14.250 --> 1:22:17.250
-I'm not going to your fucking trial.
-[Elizabeth] Why not, honey?

1:22:18.125 --> 1:22:20.708
She has to pay for her incompetence.

1:22:20.791 --> 1:22:22.458
-Is this about money?
-[Elizabeth] No!

1:22:23.375 --> 1:22:25.666
Is it about what people think?

1:22:25.750 --> 1:22:27.041
It's about you.

1:22:28.041 --> 1:22:30.291
It's about you having to face this thing--

1:22:30.375 --> 1:22:34.750
I am facing this!
I am facing it! I am facing this!

1:22:34.833 --> 1:22:36.750
Well, I don't think you are.

1:22:37.375 --> 1:22:40.333
We need-- we need some justice here.

1:22:40.416 --> 1:22:45.291
No, you need. That is what you want.
That is what you need. That is your way!

1:22:45.375 --> 1:22:48.250
[loudly] That is not my way!
That is what you need!

1:22:49.666 --> 1:22:51.875
[Elizabeth] Martha,
if you had done it my way,

1:22:51.958 --> 1:22:56.041
you'd be holding your baby
in your arms right now.

1:23:01.333 --> 1:23:02.458
[gasps]

1:23:06.208 --> 1:23:07.958
You know what? You--

1:23:08.875 --> 1:23:10.083
You're ashamed.

1:23:10.875 --> 1:23:12.958
You're so ashamed of me.

1:23:13.041 --> 1:23:16.166
You're ashamed because I failed.
"Oh, what a disgrace!"

1:23:16.250 --> 1:23:17.916
"What a disgrace!"

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.166
I failed!

1:23:19.250 --> 1:23:21.250
-[Elizabeth] Yes.
-You're fucking ashamed.

1:23:21.333 --> 1:23:23.083
And I'm ashamed of me.

1:23:23.166 --> 1:23:24.875
That I wasn't a good enough mother

1:23:24.958 --> 1:23:30.375
to teach you how to stand up
and speak for yourself, for God's sakes.

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:34.000
And to deal with this.
Like my mother taught me.

1:23:35.083 --> 1:23:41.125
After my father went into the ghetto,
my mother found a shack, an empty shack,

1:23:41.208 --> 1:23:43.833
that she went into and gave birth to me.

1:23:44.500 --> 1:23:46.583
Without any help at all.

1:23:47.250 --> 1:23:54.166
She stashed me under the floorboards
when she had to go out and steal food

1:23:54.250 --> 1:23:57.833
so she could make milk
enough to keep me alive,

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.791
but just alive.

1:23:59.875 --> 1:24:03.666
Not strong enough to cry,
or we'd be caught.

1:24:05.625 --> 1:24:11.916
When she finally got me to a doctor,
he advised her to just let me go.

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:14.000
That I wasn't…

1:24:15.083 --> 1:24:17.291
I wasn't strong enough to survive.

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.750
But when she absolutely insisted,

1:24:21.916 --> 1:24:27.583
he picked me up by my feet
and held me up like a chicken and said,

1:24:27.666 --> 1:24:30.125
"If she tries to lift her head,

1:24:32.166 --> 1:24:33.583
then there's hope."

1:24:35.416 --> 1:24:37.125
And you know what I did, Martha?

1:24:38.750 --> 1:24:40.458
I lifted my head.

1:24:41.333 --> 1:24:43.791
That's what I'm asking you to do now.

1:24:43.875 --> 1:24:47.333
Lift your head and fight for yourself,
for God's sakes!

1:24:47.416 --> 1:24:49.791
Go out there and face that woman.

1:24:49.875 --> 1:24:53.833
Tell her what it's like for you now,
what this feels like.

1:24:55.166 --> 1:24:58.541
You have to do this, Martha.
You have to speak your truth.

1:24:58.625 --> 1:25:01.416
Otherwise, you're never gonna
be able to deal with this.

1:25:02.125 --> 1:25:04.625
You're never gonna be able to move on.

1:25:04.708 --> 1:25:07.416
You've got to move on past this, Martha.

1:25:08.125 --> 1:25:10.041
[Martha whispers] Stop it. Stop it.

1:25:15.083 --> 1:25:15.916
[gasps]

1:25:19.125 --> 1:25:20.000
[hesitates]

1:26:47.750 --> 1:26:51.375
[Sean] Maybe I'll go make some tea.
I know my dad always makes tea when--

1:26:51.458 --> 1:26:53.708
When his daughters loathe him?

1:26:59.458 --> 1:27:01.625
I think Martha's starting over.

1:27:01.708 --> 1:27:04.250
Good. I'm sorry. I--

1:27:05.125 --> 1:27:06.958
I never liked you.

1:27:08.541 --> 1:27:11.583
-And it's not because you're poor.
-No, it's 'cause I'm, um--

1:27:14.791 --> 1:27:19.208
'Cause I'm not an intellectual,
and I'm not-- I don't use big words.

1:27:19.291 --> 1:27:21.958
And 'cause I'm rough and I'm--

1:27:22.041 --> 1:27:25.125
Well, here's a Scrabble word.
'Cause I'm boorish.

1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:27.166
[chuckles] Ooh.

1:27:27.250 --> 1:27:28.125
[laughs]

1:27:33.500 --> 1:27:34.708
What do you want?

1:27:38.125 --> 1:27:39.750
What do I want? I want to…

1:27:42.958 --> 1:27:44.250
I probably want to go home.

1:27:45.291 --> 1:27:47.000
Yeah, that's what I want the most.

1:27:47.458 --> 1:27:48.666
And why don't you?

1:27:50.666 --> 1:27:52.958
We don't all live like this, you know.

1:28:02.375 --> 1:28:03.333
[chuckles softly]

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.208
Take it and…

1:28:09.458 --> 1:28:10.708
don't come back.

1:28:11.666 --> 1:28:13.958
Just tell Martha--
Tell her anything you want.

1:28:14.041 --> 1:28:17.375
Tell her your father's sick
or you fell in love with somebody else.

1:28:17.458 --> 1:28:18.541
I don't care what.

1:28:19.541 --> 1:28:22.958
But just make sure she knows
you are never coming back.

1:28:51.041 --> 1:28:52.125
[chuckles softly]

1:29:09.791 --> 1:29:11.041
[door opens]

1:29:17.625 --> 1:29:19.791
-Found a little party pooper here.
-Huh?

1:29:20.583 --> 1:29:22.125
-Party pooper.
-[chuckles] Oh.

1:29:22.750 --> 1:29:23.625
Right.

1:29:27.375 --> 1:29:28.208
Uh,

1:29:29.166 --> 1:29:31.916
I just wanted to say that I didn't know

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:33.916
that she didn't tell you
I was gonna be here.

1:29:34.000 --> 1:29:35.083
Oh, that's all right.

1:29:43.416 --> 1:29:45.166
You a cat or a dog person?

1:29:46.458 --> 1:29:48.083
-Cat person.
-[Sean] Yeah?

1:29:48.166 --> 1:29:49.000
Mm-hmm.

1:29:50.250 --> 1:29:51.833
I'm a cat person too.

1:29:53.375 --> 1:29:55.208
-Bullshit.
-[Sean laughs]

1:29:58.708 --> 1:30:01.541
You know what
a cat's favorite breakfast food is?

1:30:01.625 --> 1:30:03.958
-[Suzanne] What?
-Mice Krispies.

1:30:04.041 --> 1:30:05.208
[both chuckle]

1:30:07.541 --> 1:30:09.541
You are far too entertained by that.

1:30:16.250 --> 1:30:18.291
I wish we'd met earlier, you know.

1:30:22.166 --> 1:30:23.083
[Sean sighs]

1:30:27.166 --> 1:30:28.291
Yeah, same.

1:30:29.708 --> 1:30:31.083
[Sean] You ever been to Seattle?

1:30:33.041 --> 1:30:35.333
-[Suzanne] No. You?
-Yeah.

1:30:38.375 --> 1:30:40.125
I'm headed up there now.

1:30:41.416 --> 1:30:42.541
It's nice there.

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.125
Yeah, I'll bet.

1:33:28.125 --> 1:33:30.416
[airplane flying overhead]

1:37:08.833 --> 1:37:10.291
[crowd clamoring]

1:37:25.083 --> 1:37:26.416
[reporter] The manslaughter trial

1:37:26.500 --> 1:37:28.750
of former midwife
and passionate home-birth advocate,

1:37:28.833 --> 1:37:31.750
Eva Woodward,
is wrapping up in court today.

1:37:31.833 --> 1:37:34.708
The 45-year-old is charged
with the home-birth death of a baby.

1:37:34.791 --> 1:37:36.041
[security machine beeps]

1:37:36.125 --> 1:37:40.375
[clamoring continues]

1:37:44.958 --> 1:37:47.458
Okay, good. Thank you.

1:37:49.416 --> 1:37:52.583
Well, she could have told--
Just give me one second. Hey, Martha.

1:37:52.666 --> 1:37:54.250
Thank you for agreeing to this.

1:37:54.333 --> 1:37:56.666
I can assure you
she will serve time in prison.

1:37:56.750 --> 1:37:58.833
-It should be a walk in the park.
-I know.

1:38:01.541 --> 1:38:03.125
[indistinct chatter]

1:38:15.250 --> 1:38:16.333
[clerk] All rise.

1:38:17.375 --> 1:38:19.333
Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.

1:38:19.416 --> 1:38:23.250
All persons having anything to do
before the Honorable Judge Spencer,

1:38:23.333 --> 1:38:27.875
now sitting in the County of Suffolk,
the justices of this court, draw near.

1:38:27.958 --> 1:38:30.583
Give your attention,
and you shall be heard.

1:38:30.666 --> 1:38:33.416
God save
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

1:38:33.500 --> 1:38:36.125
The court is open. You may be seated.

1:38:39.250 --> 1:38:41.291
[Judge Spencer] Yesterday,
we heard opening arguments

1:38:41.375 --> 1:38:44.041
on State versus Eva Woodward.

1:38:44.125 --> 1:38:47.875
Prosecution through the district attorney
carries the burden of proof.

1:38:47.958 --> 1:38:50.041
Therefore, the prosecution will go first.

1:38:50.500 --> 1:38:52.250
You may call your first witness.

1:38:52.333 --> 1:38:55.041
[Suzanne] Your Honor,
the Commonwealth calls Martha Weiss.

1:38:55.125 --> 1:38:58.208
[Judge Spencer] Ms. Weiss, please come
forward and be sworn in by the clerk.

1:39:08.416 --> 1:39:09.625
Stand there, please.

1:39:11.208 --> 1:39:12.416
Raise your right hand.

1:39:13.208 --> 1:39:17.041
Do you promise to tell the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

1:39:17.125 --> 1:39:19.125
-[Martha] I do.
-Please state your name.

1:39:19.208 --> 1:39:20.250
Martha Weiss.

1:39:22.250 --> 1:39:24.333
-[Suzanne] May I, Your Honor?
-[Judge Spencer] Please.

1:39:32.333 --> 1:39:33.583
Could you please tell the court

1:39:33.666 --> 1:39:36.625
how the defendant came to be
the midwife for the delivery of your baby?

1:39:36.708 --> 1:39:38.875
She was standing in
for our original midwife

1:39:38.958 --> 1:39:40.791
who couldn't make it to the house in time.

1:39:40.875 --> 1:39:43.916
[Suzanne] But you weren't happy
when you heard she was going to be coming

1:39:44.000 --> 1:39:45.791
instead of your chosen midwife, Barbara.

1:39:45.875 --> 1:39:47.958
I didn't know her,
but I thought it would be fine.

1:39:48.041 --> 1:39:50.083
[Suzanne] You trusted her
to safely deliver your baby.

1:39:50.166 --> 1:39:53.416
-I did, yes.
-[Suzanne] May I ask why you trusted her?

1:39:53.958 --> 1:39:58.541
Because, um, Barbara did
and because she was qualified, I guess.

1:39:59.666 --> 1:40:02.708
[Suzanne] During the labor, Ms. Woodward
was taking the baby's heart rate

1:40:02.791 --> 1:40:05.625
to see if the baby was okay
and that she could handle the labor?

1:40:05.708 --> 1:40:06.541
Yes.

1:40:07.458 --> 1:40:11.333
[Suzanne] The first time she checked
the baby's heart rate, it was strong, yes?

1:40:11.416 --> 1:40:12.333
Yes, it was.

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.208
[Suzanne] How many times
did she check the heart rate?

1:40:18.041 --> 1:40:19.666
About three, I would say.

1:40:19.750 --> 1:40:20.833
-[Suzanne] Three times?
-Yes.

1:40:20.916 --> 1:40:23.041
-[Suzanne] That's all? Only three times?
-Yes.

1:40:23.875 --> 1:40:26.208
[Suzanne] And then
she told you to take a bath.

1:40:26.833 --> 1:40:27.666
Yes.

1:40:27.750 --> 1:40:30.208
[Suzanne] Did she take
the baby's heart rate while in the bath?

1:40:30.291 --> 1:40:32.625
-[Martha] No.
-[Suzanne] So, let me get this straight.

1:40:32.708 --> 1:40:36.041
There's a sustained period of time
while you were in the bath

1:40:36.708 --> 1:40:39.291
where the baby's heart rate
was not being monitored.

1:40:44.583 --> 1:40:45.416
[Martha] Yes.

1:40:45.500 --> 1:40:49.500
[Suzanne] Did she ever communicate to you
explicitly that a lowered heart rate

1:40:49.583 --> 1:40:52.541
could mean that the baby was in distress
and that this could cause her death?

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:56.333
She didn't say that to me.

1:40:56.416 --> 1:40:59.833
If you knew about the risk, would you
have demanded to go to the hospital?

1:40:59.916 --> 1:41:02.708
Of course I would have
wanted to know that.

1:41:02.791 --> 1:41:05.458
-Would you ever willingly harm your baby?
-Of course not.

1:41:05.541 --> 1:41:09.166
[Suzanne] No. So if in one of the most
difficult moments of your life,

1:41:09.250 --> 1:41:10.833
during a difficult labor,

1:41:11.541 --> 1:41:14.166
the woman who you've decided
to put your trust in,

1:41:14.250 --> 1:41:18.708
who's been present at hundreds of births,
has far more experience than you do,

1:41:18.791 --> 1:41:22.083
turns to you and says,
"You must go to the hospital right now,"

1:41:22.166 --> 1:41:23.875
would you have gone in? Yes or no?

1:41:33.750 --> 1:41:34.958
Yes, I would have.

1:41:37.166 --> 1:41:38.916
No further questions, Your Honor.

1:41:42.416 --> 1:41:44.791
Mr. Lane, cross-examine?

1:41:50.125 --> 1:41:51.583
[Lane] Thank you, Your Honor.

1:41:53.500 --> 1:41:57.625
First, may I say
how deeply sorry I am for your loss?

1:41:57.708 --> 1:41:58.708
Thank you.

1:41:59.833 --> 1:42:02.458
[Lane] May I ask you
why you decided on a home birth?

1:42:04.041 --> 1:42:06.791
I wanted the baby to decide
when she wanted to come.

1:42:06.875 --> 1:42:09.541
Would it be fair to say
you were absolutely determined

1:42:09.625 --> 1:42:11.791
to have a home birth,
that you had your heart set on it?

1:42:11.875 --> 1:42:14.208
-[Martha] Yes.
-[Lane] And your partner agreed with you?

1:42:15.125 --> 1:42:17.000
We agreed to do it together. Yes.

1:42:17.083 --> 1:42:19.291
And you both knew if there was a problem,

1:42:19.375 --> 1:42:22.666
you may have to go to the hospital
to deliver the baby. Is that true?

1:42:22.750 --> 1:42:23.750
Of course, yes.

1:42:23.833 --> 1:42:27.958
[Lane] Because at a hospital,
you knew that should a problem arise,

1:42:28.041 --> 1:42:29.833
-that there was equipment--
-Yes, I knew that.

1:42:29.916 --> 1:42:32.083
-There was expertise in a crisis--
-Yes.

1:42:32.166 --> 1:42:35.500
And yet, when complications did arrive,

1:42:35.583 --> 1:42:39.541
and your midwife suggested
you may consider going to the hospital

1:42:39.625 --> 1:42:42.666
because of a heart arrhythmia,
you decided to stay at the house.

1:42:42.750 --> 1:42:45.208
Yes, but she didn't say that to me. No.

1:42:46.583 --> 1:42:49.708
[Lane] Let me ask this. You said earlier
you trust your midwife. Is that right?

1:42:49.791 --> 1:42:50.625
I did.

1:42:50.708 --> 1:42:52.833
[Lane] Yes. And do you trust your husband?

1:42:52.916 --> 1:42:54.375
-My partner?
-[Lane] Yes.

1:42:54.458 --> 1:42:57.333
Yes, I do… did.

1:42:57.416 --> 1:43:00.833
[Lane] Because your partner
has given testimony

1:43:00.916 --> 1:43:05.041
that your midwife strongly advised
you should go to the hospital.

1:43:05.125 --> 1:43:07.541
You say you're working together as a team.

1:43:07.625 --> 1:43:11.625
And when your partner asked you
to go to the hospital, you refused to go.

1:43:11.708 --> 1:43:12.916
Is that correct?

1:43:16.750 --> 1:43:17.958
Is that correct?

1:43:20.791 --> 1:43:22.416
I wanted to stay at home myself.

1:43:22.500 --> 1:43:26.083
[Lane] And you actively and adamantly
stated that to your husband

1:43:26.166 --> 1:43:28.083
that you didn't want
to go to the hospital?

1:43:28.166 --> 1:43:29.041
[Martha] I did. Yes.

1:43:29.125 --> 1:43:32.541
[Lane] The few moments
after your baby was born,

1:43:32.625 --> 1:43:34.000
was her breathing disturbed

1:43:34.083 --> 1:43:36.875
or was there anything
to indicate her condition was poor?

1:43:38.166 --> 1:43:40.375
-No, not at--
-[Lane] Did you hear her cry?

1:43:41.250 --> 1:43:42.791
-Yes, a bit.
-Did you hold her?

1:43:43.958 --> 1:43:46.583
-Yes, I held--
-[Lane] Was her body warm or cold?

1:43:50.666 --> 1:43:51.958
I can't remember that.

1:43:52.041 --> 1:43:54.708
You can't remember that?
Did you notice anything strange?

1:43:54.791 --> 1:43:57.750
Did you notice that her feet
were turning blue and purple?

1:43:59.791 --> 1:44:02.916
-I didn't look at her feet.
-Did you look at her hands?

1:44:04.666 --> 1:44:05.625
No.

1:44:06.291 --> 1:44:10.333
You didn't look at her feet or her hands.
Did you notice the color of her eyes?

1:44:10.416 --> 1:44:12.541
Did you notice
whether she had blonde hair,

1:44:12.625 --> 1:44:15.583
dark hair, lots of hair, no hair?

1:44:17.166 --> 1:44:18.375
Yes, she…

1:44:19.125 --> 1:44:21.208
-[Lane] Pardon me?
-It was dark. Yes.

1:44:21.291 --> 1:44:22.833
[Lane] Her hair was dark. Yes.

1:44:22.916 --> 1:44:24.500
Did you notice anything else?

1:44:24.583 --> 1:44:27.916
That her fingers were long?
Or her toes… Did she have ten fingers--

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:31.000
-I said I looked at her face.
-[Lane] You looked at her face.

1:44:31.083 --> 1:44:32.000
Yes.

1:44:33.750 --> 1:44:36.208
What did you feel
when you were holding your baby?

1:44:39.333 --> 1:44:40.833
How did I feel?

1:44:40.916 --> 1:44:45.041
[Lane] Yes, how did you feel holding
your baby you had just given birth to?

1:45:02.083 --> 1:45:04.375
She smelled like an apple.
[chuckles softly]

1:45:04.458 --> 1:45:07.333
-She smelled like an apple.
-[Martha] Mm-hmm.

1:45:07.416 --> 1:45:11.083
"What did she feel?" was the question.
Did she feel like a healthy baby?

1:45:13.125 --> 1:45:14.333
She did. Yes.

1:45:14.416 --> 1:45:15.625
[Lane softly] Yes.

1:45:15.708 --> 1:45:20.000
[sighs] If your baby had died
because of something like SIDS--

1:45:20.083 --> 1:45:21.625
[Suzanne] Objection, Your Honor.

1:45:21.708 --> 1:45:24.541
SIDS has not been established
as a definite cause of death.

1:45:24.625 --> 1:45:26.833
Let the jury decide, not the witness.

1:45:28.916 --> 1:45:32.958
I would like to hear the witness's
testimony as to her state of mind.

1:45:33.750 --> 1:45:37.125
If you feel you can answer
the question, I would like you to.

1:45:38.041 --> 1:45:40.458
[sniffles] Can I have a break?
Just one minute?

1:45:42.166 --> 1:45:43.041
Mr. Lane?

1:45:44.333 --> 1:45:46.083
I have no further questions, Your Honor.

1:45:46.166 --> 1:45:48.833
[Judge Spencer] Then this court will be
in recess till this afternoon.

1:45:48.916 --> 1:45:51.500
-Thank you.
-The trial will continue after the break.

1:45:51.583 --> 1:45:52.625
[clerk] All rise.

1:46:47.291 --> 1:46:48.291
[man] Can I help you?

1:46:48.375 --> 1:46:52.875
Um, do you have any photos here
under the name of Weiss?

1:46:52.958 --> 1:46:54.750
[man] Weiss.

1:46:55.833 --> 1:46:56.708
Weiss.

1:46:58.416 --> 1:47:00.250
Um-- Oh, yeah.

1:47:01.416 --> 1:47:02.666
We prepared the negatives,

1:47:02.750 --> 1:47:05.333
but we didn't print any
'cause we never heard back.

1:47:05.416 --> 1:47:08.083
-You wanna check them out?
-Yes. Is that okay?

1:47:08.166 --> 1:47:09.000
[man] Sure.

1:47:10.041 --> 1:47:10.958
There you go.

1:47:40.500 --> 1:47:43.041
-Can you print them right now?
-[man] Sure.

1:47:59.708 --> 1:48:01.083
It just takes a second.

1:48:01.833 --> 1:48:03.166
I'll be back in a minute.

1:48:13.125 --> 1:48:14.833
[Martha breathing shakily]

1:48:24.166 --> 1:48:25.041
[sniffles]

1:48:38.125 --> 1:48:38.958
[whimpers]

1:48:40.833 --> 1:48:41.791
[shakily] Oh, God.

1:48:44.708 --> 1:48:45.625
Oh, God.

1:49:14.083 --> 1:49:15.750
[breathing shakily]

1:49:22.750 --> 1:49:27.291
[Lane] Your Honor, I'd like to submit
additional documents indicating

1:49:27.375 --> 1:49:31.750
certain inconsistencies that were
presented earlier by the prosecution.

1:49:34.916 --> 1:49:35.750
[door closes]

1:49:49.666 --> 1:49:51.958
[Martha] Could I just have
a word with the judge?

1:49:52.041 --> 1:49:52.875
[clerk] Directly?

1:49:52.958 --> 1:49:54.916
-[Martha] Yes.
-[clerk] That's not usually allowed.

1:49:55.000 --> 1:49:57.458
-[Martha] I know. But do you mind asking?
-I will ask him.

1:49:57.541 --> 1:49:59.375
-Thank you.
-Please wait here.

1:50:00.458 --> 1:50:03.666
Judge, Miss Weiss
would like to address the court.

1:50:03.750 --> 1:50:06.916
That's highly unusual,
but I'd like to hear what she has to say.

1:50:07.000 --> 1:50:09.458
Miss Weiss, you wish to address the court?

1:50:09.541 --> 1:50:10.625
Yes, thank you.

1:50:30.166 --> 1:50:31.333
This woman…

1:50:34.916 --> 1:50:37.958
did not intentionally harm my girl.

1:50:41.458 --> 1:50:45.416
She only wanted to deliver
a healthy baby that night. [sobs]

1:50:46.500 --> 1:50:48.625
And I do not think it is your fault.

1:50:48.708 --> 1:50:50.541
I do not think it is her fault.

1:50:53.500 --> 1:50:54.583
And thank you.

1:51:04.791 --> 1:51:09.208
There might be a reason for what happened,
but we are not gonna find it in this room.

1:51:13.541 --> 1:51:18.958
And if I stand here
and ask for compensation or money,

1:51:20.500 --> 1:51:21.416
then I am--

1:51:22.125 --> 1:51:25.083
I'm saying that
I can be compensated, and I can't.

1:51:28.041 --> 1:51:29.541
I can't bring her back.

1:51:30.250 --> 1:51:33.000
No money or verdicts or sentences can…

1:51:35.333 --> 1:51:36.833
can bring back what…

1:51:41.333 --> 1:51:44.083
How can I give this pain to someone else?

1:51:44.166 --> 1:51:45.791
Someone who's already suffered?

1:51:47.625 --> 1:51:49.708
And I know she would not want that.

1:51:50.875 --> 1:51:51.708
At all.

1:51:54.416 --> 1:51:57.958
That is not why
my daughter came into this world

1:51:58.541 --> 1:52:00.083
for the time that she did.

1:52:13.208 --> 1:52:14.416
[laughs, gasps]

1:52:18.000 --> 1:52:21.083
And that is all I have to say. Thank you.

1:52:24.125 --> 1:52:25.000
[crying]

1:52:28.125 --> 1:52:30.083
-Thank you, Miss Weiss.
-[clerk] All rise.

1:53:02.250 --> 1:53:03.958
[birds chirping]

1:54:15.416 --> 1:54:16.666
[Anita] Base panel.

1:54:16.750 --> 1:54:20.125
And he looked in and I was like,
"What? It was from a cartoon."

1:54:20.833 --> 1:54:23.333
I remember
'cause it was like a neon green.

1:54:23.416 --> 1:54:26.041
-Yeah, do you remember this, Mom?
-Thank you.

1:54:26.125 --> 1:54:27.750
But we didn't order that.

1:54:28.333 --> 1:54:29.458
Yes, you did, Mom.

1:54:31.250 --> 1:54:32.083
I did?

1:54:32.166 --> 1:54:33.791
[Anita] Mom, it's lemon poppy.
You love it.

1:54:34.541 --> 1:54:37.208
Lemon poppy? I don't love lemon poppy.

1:54:37.291 --> 1:54:38.666
-Oh, my God, um…
-No.

1:54:38.750 --> 1:54:39.666
[Elizabeth] No?

1:54:40.333 --> 1:54:42.208
-Okay.
-Jerry Thompson.

1:54:42.291 --> 1:54:43.416
[Anita] Jerry Thompson.

1:54:43.500 --> 1:54:45.083
-[Martha] That was it.
-[Anita] Yeah.

1:54:45.166 --> 1:54:47.166
-Yes.
-[Anita] One year we went to that party.

1:54:47.250 --> 1:54:50.458
It was like some older guy was
throwing a party, and we snuck out.

1:54:50.541 --> 1:54:52.166
-Sorry, now you know.
-[Elizabeth chuckles]

1:54:52.250 --> 1:54:56.000
And we went as, like, two pieces of candy.

1:54:56.666 --> 1:54:57.500
[Martha] Yes!

1:54:57.583 --> 1:54:59.291
[Anita] No, you know
what you're thinking of,

1:54:59.375 --> 1:55:01.833
'cause you made our Thanksgiving costumes.

1:55:01.916 --> 1:55:02.875
What do you remember?

1:56:29.458 --> 1:56:31.458
[birds chirping]

1:58:17.000 --> 1:58:18.125
[Martha] Lucy!

1:58:23.333 --> 1:58:24.416
Lucy!

1:58:28.916 --> 1:58:29.875
Luce!

1:58:31.875 --> 1:58:33.125
Lucianna!

1:58:39.750 --> 1:58:40.750
Hey, baby.

1:58:41.833 --> 1:58:42.875
It's dinner.

1:58:44.875 --> 1:58:47.250
Come down. Time to eat, bug.

1:58:47.333 --> 1:58:48.291
[Lucianna] Okay.

1:58:49.375 --> 1:58:51.416
[Martha grunts] There you are.

1:58:51.500 --> 1:58:53.458
[Lucianna] I'm hungry. What's for dinner?

1:58:53.541 --> 1:58:54.791
[Martha] It's your favorite.

1:58:54.875 --> 1:58:56.000
[Lucianna] Popsicle?

1:58:56.083 --> 1:58:57.000
[Martha] Mm-mm.

1:58:57.583 --> 1:58:58.708
[Lucianna] Tacos?

1:58:58.791 --> 1:58:59.791
[Martha] No.

1:58:59.875 --> 1:59:01.125
[Lucianna] Jelly sandwich?

1:59:01.791 --> 1:59:02.916
[Martha] Definitely not.

1:59:03.000 --> 1:59:04.458
-[Lucianna] Popcorn?
-Mm-mm.

1:59:05.583 --> 1:59:06.958
[Lucianna] Then I'm not hungry.

1:59:08.291 --> 1:59:09.458
[Martha] You wanna run in?
