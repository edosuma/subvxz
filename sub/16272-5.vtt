WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:03.370
And sweep the mine.
And sweep the...

00:03.400 --> 00:05.340
And...

00:05.370 --> 00:06.770
Sweep the mine.

00:08.610 --> 00:10.410
And...

00:10.440 --> 00:11.380
Sweep...

00:11.410 --> 00:12.340
Damn it!

00:12.380 --> 00:13.850
Uh, excuse me, Todd,
do you mind?

00:13.880 --> 00:14.810
Some of us are actually

00:14.850 --> 00:16.050
trying to work here.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.720
Oh, sorry, my bad.

00:17.750 --> 00:19.580
Wait, you're Zephyrian, right?

00:19.620 --> 00:21.290
You might appreciate this.

00:21.320 --> 00:22.990
Hmm.

00:23.960 --> 00:25.020
Excuse me.

00:25.060 --> 00:26.090
I ordered

00:26.130 --> 00:27.430
the chopped salad.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.930
Chopped salad?!

00:28.960 --> 00:30.200
Oh!

00:34.270 --> 00:35.400
What the hell is this?

00:35.440 --> 00:36.740
It's this idiotic sitcom called

00:36.770 --> 00:38.340
<i>I'll have what he's stabbing.</i>

00:38.370 --> 00:40.210
One of the main
characters is Zephyrian

00:40.240 --> 00:41.910
and he's super violent.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.240
You ruined my salad.

00:45.280 --> 00:46.650
All right,

00:46.680 --> 00:48.410
it's kind of funny.

00:48.450 --> 00:49.380
It's not funny.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.820
It's racist, is what it is.

00:50.850 --> 00:52.020
Is this what you think
Zephyrians are like?

00:52.050 --> 00:53.990
Not just because of the show.

00:54.020 --> 00:56.450
I mean, you're the scariest,
most violent person

00:56.490 --> 00:57.760
I've ever met, Zorn.

00:57.790 --> 00:58.960
That's not true.
I would never do...

00:58.990 --> 01:00.060
So, this wasn't you,

01:00.090 --> 01:01.990
Rom Rom?
Because it looks to me

01:02.030 --> 01:04.500
like this was done
with a giant sword.

01:06.630 --> 01:07.670
He just cut

01:07.700 --> 01:09.030
the table in half!

01:09.070 --> 01:12.270
I've seen you do
that exact move.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074

01:23.620 --> 01:25.450
Split the bill?!

01:25.490 --> 01:27.250
Not a problem!

01:29.060 --> 01:30.060
I don't get it.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.390
I mean, it's 2016.

01:31.430 --> 01:33.560
Are people okay
with this sort of racism?

01:33.590 --> 01:34.960
I blame the Mexicans.

01:35.000 --> 01:36.960
Yeah, sure,
Zephyrians are proud warriors,

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
but we've also got
a rich history of art,

01:39.030 --> 01:40.400
and music and food.

01:40.430 --> 01:42.530
I-I mean, we invented
tiny carrots,

01:42.570 --> 01:44.540
which the rest of the world
is only now discovering.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.400
Alangulon, here, come here.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.510
You won't believe this. There's
a Zephyrian character on TV

01:48.540 --> 01:49.810
who's basically just...
Oh, Rom Rom?

01:49.840 --> 01:51.440
No, he's hilarious.
Hilarious?!

01:51.480 --> 01:53.350
What are y... no, he's
an affront to our culture.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.310
Our culture?

01:54.350 --> 01:56.150
I'm American.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.280
Only from the waist up.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
Yeah, I mean I'm half-Zephyrian

01:58.350 --> 01:59.850
technically, like by blood.

01:59.890 --> 02:01.750
But culturally? I mean,
I wouldn't even kill a spider.

02:01.790 --> 02:03.310
Yeah, I wouldn't
kill a spider, either,

02:03.320 --> 02:04.920
because they're
reincarnated wizards.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.330
But is that what you think
of us, that we're all just

02:07.360 --> 02:09.360
raging, warlike barbarians?

02:09.400 --> 02:10.759
Yeah, that's basically, like,
the definition of a zephie.

02:10.800 --> 02:12.000
"Zephie"?
Oh, my god.

02:12.030 --> 02:13.030
Who taught you that word?

02:13.070 --> 02:14.670
You did.
You say it all the time.

02:14.700 --> 02:15.670
I can say it

02:15.700 --> 02:16.800
'cause I'm from Zephyria

02:16.840 --> 02:18.100
and-and proud of it,

02:18.140 --> 02:19.500
I might add, unlike you.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.010
You never even wear

02:21.040 --> 02:22.240
the warrior's belt I got you.

02:22.280 --> 02:23.740
You think I'm gonna wear that
in public?

02:23.780 --> 02:25.280
Uh, yeah, 'cause it's a symbol

02:25.310 --> 02:26.750
of your Zephyrian heritage.
Okay?

02:26.780 --> 02:28.660
In fact, you know what?
You're wearing it today.

02:28.680 --> 02:30.080
Give me that. Here.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.550
Dad, come on.

02:31.590 --> 02:32.650
You know, he's just gonna

02:32.690 --> 02:33.690
take it off
when he gets to school.

02:33.720 --> 02:34.720
Oh, no, no, no.

02:34.760 --> 02:35.760
Don't do that, Alangulon.

02:35.790 --> 02:36.720
No, uh, t-t-that thing

02:36.760 --> 02:37.790
is enchanted, okay?

02:37.820 --> 02:39.420
If you take it off,
you'll turn to stone.

02:39.430 --> 02:41.270
Should've mentioned that
before I guess, right?

02:41.960 --> 02:43.700
So, I keep a slice
of the free bread,

02:43.730 --> 02:46.200
order the open-face
sandwich, boom.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.330
Regular sandwich.

02:47.370 --> 02:49.670
There's no place like gnome!

02:50.800 --> 02:52.000
Oh, new neighbors moved in.

02:53.670 --> 02:57.140
There's no place like gnome!

03:00.380 --> 03:02.410
Dave Ellis and Wendell Knox

03:02.450 --> 03:04.180
playing hacky sack.

03:04.220 --> 03:06.150
If this doesn't say
sophomore class, 2017,

03:06.190 --> 03:09.020
I really do not know what does.

03:09.060 --> 03:10.390
I got the, uh, perfect
yearbook caption here.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.560
"Just a couple of sack masters

03:12.590 --> 03:14.190
straight blastin' the hack."

03:14.230 --> 03:15.460
Or the sack.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.000
"Two sack masters
hackin' the..."

03:17.030 --> 03:19.000
Uh, yeah...

03:19.030 --> 03:20.130
Never mind.
'Sup, losers?

03:20.170 --> 03:21.670
Yo.
I'm just kidding.

03:21.700 --> 03:22.730
You guys are my only friends.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.070
Oh, my god, diversity students

03:24.100 --> 03:25.140
sitting around each other.

03:25.170 --> 03:26.500
This is what we call

03:26.540 --> 03:27.840
in the yearbook business
the money shot.

03:27.870 --> 03:29.070
If you'll excuse me.

03:30.480 --> 03:31.840
Dude, she's totally into you.

03:31.880 --> 03:32.940
What?!

03:32.980 --> 03:34.350
No, I mean, we're just friends.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.210
Layla?
I mean...

03:36.250 --> 03:38.320
Maybe? I... you think,
you think-think,

03:38.350 --> 03:40.390
like, we could...
Yes, dude, totally.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.590
Now get over there and show her

03:41.620 --> 03:43.020
that awesome Zephyrian belt

03:43.060 --> 03:45.060
your dad gave you. Get it out.
No, no, stop.

03:47.390 --> 03:49.060
Did something just...?
Huh?

03:49.100 --> 03:50.400
What?

03:50.430 --> 03:54.200
There's no place like gnome!

03:55.800 --> 03:59.740
There's no place like gnome!

04:01.480 --> 04:03.480
There's no place like gnome!

04:04.510 --> 04:05.580
Hey, uh, you guys

04:05.610 --> 04:06.610
have any herpes cream

04:06.650 --> 04:07.450
I could borrow?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.950
Uh... for a friend?

04:08.980 --> 04:10.250
Oh, yeah, I think we might.

04:10.280 --> 04:11.450
A friend left some over here.

04:11.490 --> 04:12.450
Nice.

04:12.490 --> 04:14.250
So, knocking,

04:14.290 --> 04:15.750
you're over that?
That's not happening anymore?

04:15.790 --> 04:17.190
Aw, come on, Edie.

04:17.220 --> 04:18.899
I've got sensitive knuckles.
You know that.

04:18.930 --> 04:20.390
Oh, by the way, I just bumped
into your new neighbor.

04:20.430 --> 04:21.829
Really?
Friendly guy.

04:21.860 --> 04:22.830
You know, good sense

04:22.860 --> 04:24.400
of humor, too, which I like.

04:24.430 --> 04:25.960
You know, I mean,
he keeps telling the same joke

04:26.000 --> 04:27.400
over and over,
but it's only getting funnier.

04:27.430 --> 04:29.000
That stupid talking gnome.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.600
I was up all night!

04:30.640 --> 04:32.000
Well, get rid of it then.
You know, you can smash it

04:32.040 --> 04:33.770
or-or you divorce it,
that seems to be

04:33.810 --> 04:35.570
your go to method. No, it's fine.
It's under control.

04:35.610 --> 04:37.280
We're gonna slide a polite,

04:37.310 --> 04:38.990
but sternly-worded letter
under their door.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.010
Letter?

04:40.050 --> 04:41.210
The Edie I used to know

04:41.250 --> 04:42.610
bashed 30 orcs with a war hammer

04:42.650 --> 04:44.450
when they threw a party
that went past midnight.

04:44.480 --> 04:47.020
Well, I'm not gonna get all
zephie-ish on our neighbor.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.950
Whoa, whoa. Easy.
"Get zephie-ish"?

04:48.990 --> 04:50.490
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

04:50.520 --> 04:51.460
Well, you just said I should...

04:51.490 --> 04:52.960
Wow. You know,
I'm curious,

04:52.990 --> 04:54.530
how come people never say
they're "getting zephie-ish"

04:54.560 --> 04:56.160
when they're weaving
a beautiful tapestry,

04:56.200 --> 04:57.530
or reciting an epic poem,

04:57.560 --> 04:58.930
or inventing tiny carrots?

04:58.970 --> 05:00.470
Zorn, I just...

05:00.500 --> 05:01.470
I mean, it's no wonder

05:01.500 --> 05:02.730
Alangulon only knows

05:02.770 --> 05:03.800
about Zephyria
through stereotypes.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.140
You've taught him nothing.

05:05.170 --> 05:07.210
Come on, you can't deny
that Zephyrians

05:07.240 --> 05:08.910
get what they want
through violence.

05:08.940 --> 05:10.340
Zorn, I can relate
to the discrimination

05:10.380 --> 05:12.010
that you're referring to.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.310
Craig, you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

05:13.350 --> 05:15.250
Edie, it's bad enough I have
to deal with this at work,

05:15.280 --> 05:16.480
but my own son?

05:16.520 --> 05:17.750
Well, maybe you
should educate him.

05:17.780 --> 05:18.980
I find the best way

05:19.020 --> 05:19.980
to do that is through

05:20.020 --> 05:21.190
a culture's cuisine.

05:21.220 --> 05:23.620
That's how I learned
all about Ohio.

05:23.660 --> 05:25.790
There's no place like gnome!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.560
I always think
he's gonna say "home,"

05:28.600 --> 05:29.520
and then, uh, you know,

05:29.530 --> 05:31.300
curveball.

05:34.530 --> 05:36.370
"Yearbook photographer

05:36.400 --> 05:37.640
waits for a ride."

05:37.670 --> 05:39.470
Is that the best you got?

05:39.510 --> 05:40.740
I know.
That was pathetic, right? Yeah.

05:40.770 --> 05:42.510
Um...

05:42.540 --> 05:45.280
Hey, you know what, I have that,
uh, spirit day page write-up

05:45.310 --> 05:47.650
to do still,
and you have all the photos.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.980
So, I was just thinking maybe,
uh, we could work on it,

05:51.020 --> 05:53.050
go get a cup of coffee? I don't know.
Together?

05:53.090 --> 05:54.250
No, I... well, I mean...
It's-it's a...

05:54.290 --> 05:55.820
No.
...Bad idea, probably.

05:55.860 --> 05:57.020
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah. I
don't know, it's like...

05:57.060 --> 05:58.290
Coffee sounds...

05:58.330 --> 06:00.290
Yeah, let me just grab my backpack.
Cool.

06:00.330 --> 06:02.160
Go do the backpack.
Yeah.

06:06.370 --> 06:08.370
Oh, my god, oh, my god.
Alangulon, get in the car!

06:08.400 --> 06:09.830
Hurry up, your mom
was in an accident.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.870
What? What kind
of accident? What...

06:15.110 --> 06:17.710
The accident of not raising you

06:17.740 --> 06:19.710
with an appreciation
of Zephyrian culture.

06:19.750 --> 06:20.880
Wait, what?
Are you serious?

06:20.910 --> 06:22.550
What?!
Driver, let's go.

06:22.580 --> 06:24.050
No.

06:29.780 --> 06:30.780
<i>You know, all the reviews say</i>

06:30.820 --> 06:32.450
this is the most authentic

06:32.480 --> 06:33.480
Zephyrian experience
in orange county.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.580
You know, before you made me
picture mom

06:35.620 --> 06:37.450
dead in a car crash,
I was actually supposed

06:37.490 --> 06:40.060
to meet someone and it was...
It's pretty important.

06:40.090 --> 06:41.720
Yeah, well, I mean,
it just seemed like

06:41.760 --> 06:43.160
you weren't that into learning
about Zephyrian culture,

06:43.190 --> 06:44.230
so I was worried
you wouldn't come,

06:44.260 --> 06:45.230
so, you know, I improvised.

06:45.260 --> 06:46.860
Yeah, I was worried
that mom was dead.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.930
Oh, boy, were you ever.

06:48.970 --> 06:50.270
Welcome to taste of Zephyria,

06:50.300 --> 06:51.860
where the enemy to be battled
is hunger.

06:51.870 --> 06:53.740
I'm Eric,
I'll be your server tonight.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.400
Hey, before we get started,
Eric, uh, can I ask you

06:55.440 --> 06:58.710
which Zephyrian battle
that mural is depicting?

06:58.740 --> 07:00.310
Ooh, is it
the battle of orphan's cove?

07:00.340 --> 07:02.710
Oof, we lost a lot of good men
to those orphans.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.050
This place used to be
a Mexican church.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.280
We inherited that mural

07:05.320 --> 07:06.420
and just kind of
made it our own.

07:06.450 --> 07:07.370
Uh, how's the stir-fry?

07:07.380 --> 07:08.950
Delicious.
It comes with a zesty

07:08.990 --> 07:10.320
Zephyrian sauce.

07:10.350 --> 07:12.020
Oh, you mean goat urine.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.120
I, uh, think we use lemon juice?

07:15.060 --> 07:16.930
Anything to drink?
Uh, yeah,

07:16.960 --> 07:18.690
two goat-urine-ades.
It... uh, larges.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.760
I mean, unless
there's free refills,

07:19.800 --> 07:20.900
then we'll just get smalls.

07:20.930 --> 07:22.700
No ice in mine, please.
No, okay, dad,

07:22.730 --> 07:24.000
it's not on the menu.

07:24.030 --> 07:25.000
Sir, while we may have taken

07:25.040 --> 07:26.030
a few tiny liberties,

07:26.070 --> 07:28.540
we are otherwise 100% authentic.

07:39.920 --> 07:41.320
Oh, my god.

07:41.350 --> 07:42.650
What is this?

07:42.690 --> 07:44.650
Come on, come on, let's go.
We're going.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.590
We're out of here.
Come on! But...

07:46.620 --> 07:48.020
Hey. I'm Edie.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.220
I live next-door

07:49.260 --> 07:50.860
and I just wanted

07:50.900 --> 07:52.060
to welcome you,

07:52.100 --> 07:53.860
both of you guys,

07:53.900 --> 07:55.500
to the neighborhood.

07:55.530 --> 07:57.200
Well, hey, right back
at you, Edie.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.700
Uh, I'm Ron Lee.

07:58.740 --> 08:00.370
And I'm April Lee.

08:00.400 --> 08:01.400
Well, great.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.640
I just wanted to say hi.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.940
Hi. Oh, but, hey,
while I'm here,

08:04.980 --> 08:08.240
did you get the letter
that my fiance left for you?

08:08.280 --> 08:10.080
The letter...
Yes, we did.

08:10.110 --> 08:11.180
Indeed, we did.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.310
We did, and you know what,

08:12.350 --> 08:13.780
we appreciate the feedback,

08:13.820 --> 08:14.880
we do.
Mm-hmm.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.620
Yeah.
Feedback.

08:16.650 --> 08:18.320
Yeah.
So...

08:18.360 --> 08:20.190
Does that mean you're not...

08:20.220 --> 08:22.760
Not gonna take down the gnome.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.030
You don't eat Zephyrian food

08:25.060 --> 08:26.860
with a fork!
I should've taken

08:26.900 --> 08:27.830
that fork and scooped out

08:27.870 --> 08:28.830
that dumb waiter's eyes!

08:28.870 --> 08:29.900
Hi, mom.

08:29.930 --> 08:31.370
I'll see you inside, sweetie.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.640
I don't...
Eat Zephyrian...

08:35.870 --> 08:37.210
Is that Craig?

08:37.240 --> 08:38.710
Him?

08:38.740 --> 08:40.240
That's funny because...

08:40.280 --> 08:41.610
Making fun of my culture!

08:42.650 --> 08:43.809
Oh, you must die.

08:43.850 --> 08:46.620
...that is my fiance.
Yes.

08:46.650 --> 08:47.620
That is Craig.

08:47.650 --> 08:48.850
He's Zephyrian?

08:48.890 --> 08:50.720
Yes.
He's Zephyrian.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.220
Wow. Why don't we take
the gnome inside?

08:53.260 --> 08:54.720
I think that's a
good idea, sweetie.

08:54.760 --> 08:55.920
Yeah.

08:55.960 --> 08:57.030
It's right over there.

08:57.060 --> 08:58.030
Yeah, mm-hmm.
So nice meeting you.

08:58.060 --> 08:59.390
Yeah, nice to meet you guys.

08:59.430 --> 09:00.360
Such a pleasure.

09:06.100 --> 09:07.440
Oh, Zorn,

09:07.470 --> 09:09.770
will you open these pickles
for me, please?

09:09.810 --> 09:11.210
Oh, oh, I get it.

09:11.240 --> 09:12.240
Because Zephyrians are
big and strong, right?

09:12.280 --> 09:13.310
That's all we're good for, huh?

09:13.340 --> 09:14.410
Lifting stuff and opening up

09:14.450 --> 09:15.610
your people's pickle jars?

09:15.650 --> 09:17.380
You know, never mind.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.180
I just need to put
a little elbow grease into it.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.550
Oh, wow, elbow grease?

09:20.580 --> 09:21.850
'Cause Zephyrians
have greasy elbows?

09:21.890 --> 09:23.120
Wow. Hey. You went there, huh.

09:23.150 --> 09:25.020
Hey, hey.
Hay?!

09:25.060 --> 09:26.560
Oh, because we love
eating fried hay?

09:26.590 --> 09:27.660
No! I just...

09:27.690 --> 09:28.920
I wasn't trying to offend you.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.290
Todd, you need to learn

09:30.330 --> 09:31.890
that people aren't stereotypes.
For instance,

09:31.930 --> 09:33.660
I'm not gonna have
fried hay right now.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.160
I am gonna have pickle.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.140
Hi, excuse me.

09:42.170 --> 09:44.170
Can you use your karate
to open up this pickle jar?

09:45.180 --> 09:47.010
What's up?

09:48.310 --> 09:50.410
Whoa, who died?
"In memoriam"?

09:50.450 --> 09:51.980
Mr. Henderson got hit

09:52.020 --> 09:53.420
with a poison dart.

09:53.450 --> 09:54.750
Oh, that's weird.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.320
Doctors think he's gonna
pull through, but...

09:56.350 --> 09:58.520
It's my job to be ready
if and when he does not.

09:58.560 --> 09:59.550
Huh.

09:59.590 --> 10:00.960
I mean, comic sans?

10:00.990 --> 10:02.620
Is that really
the appropriate font

10:02.660 --> 10:04.590
to convey a respectful sadness?

10:04.630 --> 10:06.600
Maybe not.

10:06.630 --> 10:09.160
Sounds like the sort of thing
we could discuss over coffee.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.930
Or say we will

10:10.970 --> 10:13.670
and then one of us
can just disappear.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.640
Layla, oh, my god, I'm so sorry.
Okay, my dad, he said

10:15.670 --> 10:16.810
my mom got in an accident

10:16.840 --> 10:17.870
just so he could take me
to a restaurant.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.310
Hey, can I make it

10:19.340 --> 10:20.380
up to you?

10:20.410 --> 10:21.880
My dad's working late on Friday.

10:21.910 --> 10:23.030
Maybe you want to come over?

10:23.050 --> 10:24.650
And do yearbook stuff?

10:24.680 --> 10:27.980
No, I was thinking we could
watch a movie or something.

10:29.290 --> 10:31.390
Yeah, okay.
Yes, yes.

10:31.420 --> 10:32.820
Yeah, cool. Great. Okay, cool.

10:32.860 --> 10:34.120
Movie.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.120
Movie.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.060
Hey, Ron,
just wanted to say thanks

10:37.090 --> 10:39.090
for taking the gnome down.
Yeah.

10:39.130 --> 10:42.030
And I have just a few
other small requests.

10:42.070 --> 10:43.470
So, you know how

10:43.500 --> 10:46.030
your oak tree drops
its leaves in our yard?

10:46.070 --> 10:47.570
Well, it does, yeah.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.810
I mean, I don't have
a problem with it,

10:49.840 --> 10:53.010
but Craig has
a huge problem with it.

10:53.040 --> 10:56.550
He got so angry, he crushed
a rock with his bare hand.

10:56.580 --> 10:58.680
I did what now?

10:58.720 --> 11:01.180
Uh, he would appreciate that.
Take care.

11:01.220 --> 11:03.520
Did you say I crushed a rock?

11:03.550 --> 11:05.920
I was, uh, talking about a dream

11:05.960 --> 11:08.660
in which dream Craig did that.

11:08.690 --> 11:11.630
Ooh, tell me more about
this "dream Craig."

11:11.660 --> 11:12.760
Well, apparently
no one around here

11:12.800 --> 11:14.330
has appreciation
for Zephyrian culture.

11:14.370 --> 11:15.430
Are you kidding?

11:15.470 --> 11:16.800
Oh, oh, sorry,
forgot to knock, right?

11:16.830 --> 11:18.370
Okay.
Ow, ow, my knuckles.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.270
Ouchie.
Ow, ow.

11:20.300 --> 11:23.210
Look, Zorn, I'm sorry,

11:23.240 --> 11:27.180
but you may just need
to be okay with your son

11:27.210 --> 11:29.640
never becoming
a barbaric maniac.

11:29.680 --> 11:31.350
I just know that if he
could see Zephyria in person,

11:31.380 --> 11:32.850
he'd love it.

11:32.880 --> 11:34.950
But there's no way
he's had all his shots.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.280
You know, he hasn't had leprosy,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.190
you got bubonic plague,
wizard's beard,

11:38.220 --> 11:39.390
purple fever, bigpox,

11:39.420 --> 11:40.620
cursed treasure allergies,

11:40.660 --> 11:42.020
irritable Basilisk syndrome.

11:42.060 --> 11:45.490
Well, Zorn, if you can't bring
Alan to Zephyria,

11:45.530 --> 11:49.030
why not bring Zephyria to Alan?

11:49.070 --> 11:51.200
"Bring Zephyria to Alan."
Hey, wait a second.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.600
Yeah... yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.240
So... is that it?

11:56.270 --> 11:57.910
Are we good?

11:57.940 --> 11:59.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
no, no, I'm good. I'm good.

11:59.610 --> 12:02.210
I'm just taking it all in still.

12:02.250 --> 12:03.780
Pretend I'm not here.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.110
Hey so just to warn you,

12:06.150 --> 12:07.950
uh, my dad only has
a laserdisc player,

12:07.990 --> 12:09.920
and a movie called <i> Fletch lives.</i>

12:09.950 --> 12:11.820
Aw, I've seen it,
like, so many times.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.190
Are you serious?

12:13.220 --> 12:15.120
No, I don't know what that is.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.290
That would be...
<i>Fletch lives?</i>

12:17.330 --> 12:19.800
Alangulon!

12:19.830 --> 12:22.060
Welcome to Zephyria!

12:22.100 --> 12:24.670
Do you like it?
If not, it was Craig's idea.

12:27.510 --> 12:30.250
Alangulon.
Alangulon's concubine.

12:30.280 --> 12:33.780
Come with me on a journey
to the beautiful, exotic land

12:33.820 --> 12:36.120
of Zephyria where you will learn

12:36.160 --> 12:38.960
all about...

12:38.990 --> 12:40.990
The greatest
damn culture on earth.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.400
You can go, for real.
Just take off.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.030
Please. No, please,
really, just go. No.

12:46.070 --> 12:47.800
It's cool.
It's-it's interesting.

12:47.830 --> 12:49.170
Now Zephyria is known

12:49.200 --> 12:51.670
war,

12:51.700 --> 12:54.270
bloodshed, tyranny and style.

12:55.470 --> 12:58.540
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

12:58.580 --> 13:00.040
Okay, we're ready, Frank!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.950
Frank is funky and fabulous,

13:02.980 --> 13:04.950
but still playful,
wearing the remains

13:04.980 --> 13:07.620
of several endangered
Zephyrian species.

13:07.650 --> 13:09.620
Dad, is that fur? Have you
killed a bunch of animals

13:09.660 --> 13:11.920
to make a piece of clothing?
Really?

13:11.960 --> 13:13.160
Oh, we're not dead!

13:13.190 --> 13:15.390
We are in terrible agony!

13:17.560 --> 13:18.560
See, Alangulon?

13:18.600 --> 13:19.660
They're alive.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.300
Nobody had to kill anybody.

13:23.900 --> 13:25.500
Except Frank. Frank just killed them.
Okay, uh,

13:25.540 --> 13:26.640
you... seriously you
can go, no problem.

13:26.670 --> 13:28.140
Take a...
No, no, no, no.

13:28.170 --> 13:30.670
But while looking sexy
is obviously important,

13:30.710 --> 13:32.940
many Zephyrians
also appreciate...

13:32.980 --> 13:35.350
The arts.
Wow.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.510
That's so cool.
Who is she?

13:37.550 --> 13:38.750
This is Winona,

13:38.780 --> 13:39.820
one of the most brutal

13:39.850 --> 13:41.420
and feared she-warriors.

13:41.450 --> 13:43.520
She looks so real.

13:43.560 --> 13:45.690
It's kind of...

13:45.730 --> 13:47.360
Mesmerizing.

13:47.390 --> 13:50.660
Uh-oh! Uh-oh! Oh, oh, oh,
cover your eyes, Layla.

13:50.700 --> 13:52.960
She's coming for your soul.
Okay, whoa, whoa, Layla?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.200
Layla's no more. I am Winona.

13:55.230 --> 13:58.500
All who oppose me
will be destroyed!

14:00.710 --> 14:03.040
Yeah, no, forgot to mention,
our paintings

14:03.080 --> 14:04.540
are actually soul prisons.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.450
What just happened?
Huh?

14:10.480 --> 14:12.150
Why are my bones cold?

14:12.180 --> 14:13.520
Uh, because you just had
your soul possessed

14:13.550 --> 14:14.920
by an evil spirit.

14:14.950 --> 14:16.150
Uh, your dad hit that,
by the way.

14:16.190 --> 14:18.320
Before and after
spectral transformation.

14:18.360 --> 14:20.390
Okay, I think we've all
learned a lot about Zephyria.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.130
I know I've got
enough for one day here.

14:22.160 --> 14:24.230
Let's-let's-let's head on out.

14:24.260 --> 14:25.700
You can't leave yet.

14:25.730 --> 14:27.600
The night's about to hit

14:27.630 --> 14:29.030
a "high note."

14:29.070 --> 14:31.270
Is that made of throats?
That?

14:31.300 --> 14:32.770
That's... of course not, not made...
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:32.810 --> 14:34.670
Sure is.
All human throats too.

14:34.710 --> 14:36.210
I mean, you consider
children human, right?

14:36.240 --> 14:37.270
Yeah.
Yeah, of course you do.

14:37.310 --> 14:38.480
No, yup, all human.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.550
Oh, that doesn't sound right.

14:42.720 --> 14:44.620
Oh!
Aw!

14:44.650 --> 14:47.720
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

14:47.750 --> 14:48.720
Dad, you're so embarrassing!

14:48.750 --> 14:50.920
Whoa, whoa, hey,
calm down, buddy.

14:50.960 --> 14:53.260
Calm down? Calm do... you just
hit my friend in the face

14:53.290 --> 14:55.160
with a human tongue!

14:55.190 --> 14:56.560
I hate Zephyria.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.400
I'd rather live in Florida.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.230
Take that back.
So...

15:00.270 --> 15:01.830
I'm gonna go.

15:01.870 --> 15:03.130
Thank you

15:03.170 --> 15:05.170
for all the new
ideas about clothes,

15:05.200 --> 15:09.740
and art and... thanks.

15:12.180 --> 15:15.710
Hey, uh, hey, I'm sorry, but
that was like a total nightmare.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.950
Yeah, three of the things
I saw today

15:17.980 --> 15:19.680
were from actual
nightmares I've had.

15:19.720 --> 15:21.850
But honestly,
I thought it was really sweet

15:21.890 --> 15:24.120
the way your dad put the whole
thing together for you.

15:24.160 --> 15:26.660
That was sweet?
My dad's culture's so weird.

15:26.690 --> 15:28.160
It really only got weird for me

15:28.190 --> 15:29.990
after you started
yelling at him.

15:30.030 --> 15:31.700
Um...

15:38.340 --> 15:39.970
Layla.

15:40.010 --> 15:40.840
Layla!

15:40.870 --> 15:43.540
Layla!
Layla!

15:43.580 --> 15:45.440
So how was your
"Zephyria night"?

15:45.480 --> 15:47.410
Horrible.
No, Alangulon hated it.

15:47.450 --> 15:50.580
Well, I want to say
I'm surprised.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.120
Ah, hell, I guess
I'll just have to accept

15:52.150 --> 15:53.480
that my son hates Zephyria.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.090
Little by little,
he'll assimilate,

15:55.120 --> 15:57.090
and my great-great-grandchildren
will have no idea

15:57.120 --> 15:58.690
that glorious Zephyrian blood

15:58.720 --> 16:00.290
is running through their veins.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.060
Well, let's not get drama...

16:14.370 --> 16:18.710
There's no place like gnome!

16:18.740 --> 16:20.410
Oh, hey, the gnome's back!

16:20.450 --> 16:22.370
Well, I've got to admit,
that cheers me up a bit.

16:22.380 --> 16:23.610
Quite a bit actually.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.880
Shut up Zorn!

16:24.920 --> 16:26.850
Did you see the neighbors' yard?

16:26.890 --> 16:29.050
Lawnapalooza, right?

16:29.090 --> 16:31.790
Which is so weird, since we had
such a nice talk yesterday.

16:31.820 --> 16:35.530
Wait, what? Oh, yeah, I ran into
Ron and April at the mailbox,

16:35.560 --> 16:38.030
and I thanked them for being
so responsive to my letter.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.930
Oh, and get this.

16:39.970 --> 16:42.330
They thought Zorn
was your fiance.

16:42.370 --> 16:44.470
Really?

16:44.500 --> 16:46.900
I know, right?

16:46.940 --> 16:48.640
Anyways, I cleared it all up.

16:54.450 --> 16:55.550
Alan, stop!

16:55.580 --> 16:56.980
What are you doing?

16:57.020 --> 16:58.720
You're gonna turn
yourself to stone!

16:58.750 --> 17:00.120
Edie, that's a myth.

17:00.150 --> 17:02.350
Alan, masturbation
is perfectly normal,

17:02.390 --> 17:03.620
and fun.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.290
What is wrong with Zephyria?

17:05.319 --> 17:07.060
Can't they just make something
that holds your pants up?

17:07.089 --> 17:09.390
Even their belts have
to assassinate people?

17:09.430 --> 17:11.859
Look, all Zephyrian culture
isn't bad.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.660
Did your dad show you
the throat-sicord?

17:13.700 --> 17:15.099
That's cool.

17:15.130 --> 17:17.099
The dead people's throats
tied together?

17:17.140 --> 17:18.339
Well, it's actually
made of throats of men

17:18.369 --> 17:19.440
who died on the battlefield.

17:19.470 --> 17:20.770
It's a great honor.

17:20.810 --> 17:22.310
Uh, what about
the child's throat?

17:22.339 --> 17:24.140
They do need a high C.

17:24.180 --> 17:25.710
See, that's what
I'm talking about, mom.

17:25.740 --> 17:27.240
They're all a bunch
of violent warriors.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.080
Warriors who are
defending their country,

17:30.120 --> 17:32.380
their families,
people they love.

17:32.420 --> 17:35.090
You could call it violent,
or you could call it heroic.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.020
Yeah, your dad
is certainly a hero.

17:37.060 --> 17:39.490
Look, he moved
halfway around the world,

17:39.530 --> 17:41.990
no friends, no job.

17:42.030 --> 17:45.060
Barely a child's understanding
of how the real world works.

17:45.100 --> 17:47.500
All that, just so he
could be closer to you.

17:49.900 --> 17:51.900
Zorn?

17:53.510 --> 17:55.070
Listen, uh,

17:55.110 --> 17:57.940
I feel really bad about
those insensitive things I said.

17:57.980 --> 18:00.940
I mean, "hey, hey, hey?"

18:00.980 --> 18:02.950
I knew what I was doing.
Yeah, so what?

18:02.980 --> 18:05.020
We like fried hay. Big whoop.
But you wouldn't go up

18:05.050 --> 18:06.680
to a Swedish person
and say, you know,

18:06.720 --> 18:08.720
"meatball, meatball, meatball."
Right?

18:08.750 --> 18:10.550
Ah, well, maybe you would.
I know.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.590
And I'm sorry.

18:13.630 --> 18:16.830
Will you let me
make it up to you?

18:16.860 --> 18:20.330
This is supposed to
be the most authentic

18:20.370 --> 18:22.670
Zephyrian restaurant in town.

18:26.470 --> 18:27.770
Oh, my god!

18:27.810 --> 18:29.440
Zorn, where are you g...

18:29.480 --> 18:31.310
Hi, there. Let me start you off
with some

18:31.340 --> 18:32.980
complimentary fried hay.

18:36.050 --> 18:37.780
Where's Alangulon?

18:37.820 --> 18:39.720
Edie said he was in an accident.
Yes, the accident

18:39.750 --> 18:43.490
of not appreciating you teaching
me about your culture.

18:43.520 --> 18:44.720
Dad, I-I'm sorry.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.020
I guess I just, you know,

18:46.060 --> 18:48.990
was embarrassed
and being an idiot.

18:49.030 --> 18:51.530
And, you know,
it's actually really cool

18:51.560 --> 18:53.230
that you spent all that
time and work to teach me

18:53.270 --> 18:54.770
about where I came from.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.170
No, no, no, no, no,
but I was forcing it on you.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.840
I should be apologizing to you.

18:59.870 --> 19:02.240
Well, I guess we've both got
some reconciling to do.

19:02.270 --> 19:03.710
Hey!

19:03.740 --> 19:06.910
Are you doing the
dance of reconciliation!

19:06.950 --> 19:09.480
Oh, no, not quite.

19:09.520 --> 19:12.380
No, that's-that's actually the
dance of perpetual virginity.

19:12.420 --> 19:14.790
But you are nailing it, son!

19:14.820 --> 19:16.220
<i>Okay, now that we've got</i>

19:16.260 --> 19:17.550
all the little rocks

19:17.590 --> 19:19.560
between you and the belt,
it'll think you

19:19.590 --> 19:21.360
have turned to stone,
then we can take it off, okay?

19:21.390 --> 19:23.930
Here we go.
One, two, three!

19:25.830 --> 19:27.330
Wow.

19:27.370 --> 19:28.770
Well, too bad that belt's
enchanted, otherwise, you know,

19:28.800 --> 19:31.070
I might wear it... sometimes.

19:31.100 --> 19:33.270
Wait, you want a Zephyrian belt?
I'll make you one.

19:33.310 --> 19:34.740
Hey Craig, give me your belt.

19:34.770 --> 19:37.340
In your dreams, big boy.
This is woven leather.

19:37.380 --> 19:39.210
Its funny that you think you
have a choice here.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.840
Hi, Ron.

19:40.880 --> 19:42.050
Thanks for calling me back.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.080
Hope you don't mind me

19:43.120 --> 19:44.780
calling you at gnome,

19:44.820 --> 19:46.580
which there is no place like.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.590
Okay, I deserve that.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.890
I'm sorry I lied to you guys.

19:49.920 --> 19:51.820
I just hope
we can move past this.

19:51.860 --> 19:53.360
Hey, I get it.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.460
And I guess we could've behaved

19:55.490 --> 19:57.330
a little better too.

19:57.360 --> 19:59.060
We'll take down all the stuff.

19:59.100 --> 20:02.330
And maybe I'll be willing
to talk about the gnome.

20:02.370 --> 20:04.170
Oh, I'd appreciate that.

20:04.200 --> 20:07.270
Honestly? I'm just happy we
don't live next to a zephie.

20:07.310 --> 20:09.170
Excuse me?

20:09.210 --> 20:11.110
I mean, could you imagine

20:11.140 --> 20:13.680
what would happen
to our property value?

20:13.710 --> 20:16.580
I mean, zephies are
a violent people

20:16.620 --> 20:19.650
with greasy elbows.
So...

20:33.070 --> 20:35.470
Hello, old friend.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.600
There's no place like gno...
