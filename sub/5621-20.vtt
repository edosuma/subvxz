<i>You're watching</i> The Grinder.

This is Edie,
your granddaughter.

00:14.382 --> 00:15.748
<i>Only on Fox.</i>

00:18.619 --> 00:21.487
We are getting killed out there!

00:21.489 --> 00:23.522
That jury is ice-cold.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.364
The board doesn't think
the jury's the problem.

00:25.993 --> 00:27.359
They think it's you.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.777
Excuse me?

00:28.778 --> 00:30.194
They think your defense
is too complicated.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.297
It's confusing the jurors.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.567
And how would the board know
what's in the heads of my jury?

00:35.569 --> 00:37.336
They have research, Mitch!

00:37.338 --> 00:39.405
Fool-proof research.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.306
I don't think I need
to tell you where the board

00:41.308 --> 00:43.208
can stick their research.

00:45.146 --> 00:48.047
DEVIN: Would it kill us
to simplify it a little bit?

00:48.049 --> 00:50.816
Why do you have
to be so stubborn?

00:51.752 --> 00:52.885
Hey.

00:52.887 --> 00:55.254
Give the board
what they want, Mitch.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.523
They're saying you can't
grind on this one.

00:57.525 --> 00:58.590
I always grind!

00:59.427 --> 01:01.093
And it always works.

01:01.095 --> 01:04.229
If I start soft-pedaling
it to this jury,

01:04.231 --> 01:06.432
they will turn on us, like that.

01:06.434 --> 01:07.499
They already have.

01:07.501 --> 01:09.601
The people, too.
They're walking out.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.603
Mitch, it's not working.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.107
We are as desperate
as we've ever been.

01:15.109 --> 01:18.577
We need to present a case
that anyone can understand,

01:18.579 --> 01:20.679
even if they know nothing.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.848
Something so simple, you barely

01:22.850 --> 01:25.517
even have to be awake
to understand it.

01:25.519 --> 01:27.753
Please. Just this once.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.189
For me.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.625
For the firm, Mitch.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.128
So what happens in the next one?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.230
Do you listen to the board
and soft-pedal the jury?

01:38.232 --> 01:39.565
Uh, something tells me
he doesn't.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.632
Why?

01:40.634 --> 01:42.401
Because they don't get it.

01:42.403 --> 01:44.103
They're not looking
into the eyes of the jury.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.572
They're up in their ivory towers
looking down on the people,

01:46.574 --> 01:48.407
and underestimating them.

01:48.409 --> 01:50.709
Yeah, but don't you think the
board might have some insight

01:50.711 --> 01:52.411
into what a jury would want?

01:52.413 --> 01:54.146
Stew, the jury doesn't want
to be spoon-fed.

01:54.148 --> 01:56.148
The jury wants to do
some work on their own.

01:56.150 --> 01:58.050
They don't just want it
to be easy to understand?

01:58.052 --> 01:59.418
Not when they're
in a Mitch Grinder jury box.

01:59.420 --> 02:01.920
Who ended up being right?
Well, I won, so.

02:01.922 --> 02:03.889
You never even tried to make it
just a little less complicated?

02:03.891 --> 02:05.457
You know, one time,
do what the board asks for?

02:05.459 --> 02:07.559
I think it might
be easier for everyone.

02:07.561 --> 02:10.262
Dad, that's not what
The Grinder stands for.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.430
Is it, Uncle Dean?

02:11.432 --> 02:12.798
No, it's not.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.099
And I'm disappointed

02:14.101 --> 02:16.101
in your father
for even suggesting it.

02:16.103 --> 02:17.103
Me, too.

02:18.772 --> 02:20.839
¶ ¶

02:23.277 --> 02:25.777
What a day. What...

02:25.779 --> 02:27.946
a... day.

02:27.948 --> 02:28.614
What?

02:28.616 --> 02:30.616
I remember where I was

02:30.618 --> 02:32.084
when I got the call

02:32.086 --> 02:35.087
that my little brother
was hanging up his cleats

02:35.089 --> 02:36.455
and getting married.

02:36.457 --> 02:37.789
Oh!

02:37.791 --> 02:39.458
Today. That's right.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.792
It's our anniversary. It is.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.461
Happy anniversary, honey.
Happy anniversary.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.863
W-w-wait a... Wait a minute.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.498
You didn't forget, did you?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.534
I didn't. I didn't forget.
No. Well, I didn't.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.335
Because, you were like,
"Oh, today's the day."

02:50.337 --> 02:52.471
And then you kissed like you
were trying to cover something.

02:52.473 --> 02:55.307
I-I forgot the,
um, our phone call.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.375
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Oh, yeah.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.210
'Cause, it was a lot
of years ago.

02:58.212 --> 03:00.646
And I was so excited about getting
married on that day. Yep.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.481
For what it's worth,
it feels like you both forgot.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.949
And you're both lying about it.
Same boat. Same boat.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.384
So you got big plans?

03:05.986 --> 03:09.454
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

03:09.456 --> 03:11.290
I wanted it to be
a surprise, uh,

03:11.292 --> 03:13.659
so I-I-I wasn't going
to say anything,

03:13.661 --> 03:15.327
but now that Dean brought it up,

03:15.329 --> 03:18.163
I have reservations, uh,
for dinner for us,

03:18.165 --> 03:19.531
uh, this weekend. Really?

03:19.533 --> 03:20.532
Mm-hmm. Where?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.900
Thank you, Ethan. Mm-hmm.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.503
Uh, I... the name of the...
it's downtown.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.471
And it's called, um, uh,

03:26.473 --> 03:28.207
Trattoria, uh, Perlagenté.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.508
Ooh.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.542
Trattoria Perlagenté.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.144
Well played, Stew bear.

03:32.146 --> 03:33.545
Yeah. Yeah, that's
pretty impressive.

03:33.547 --> 03:35.214
That place has, like,
a two-month waiting list.

03:35.216 --> 03:36.848
Yeah. Is that... is it...

03:36.850 --> 03:39.351
Months. Mm-hmm.
That makes sense.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.886
That's how long ago
I made the reservation.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.321
It was, uh, two months.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.522
Wow.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.190
All right, so, Mom,
what did you do for Dad?

03:45.192 --> 03:46.892
For him?

03:46.894 --> 03:50.529
I got a crazy present.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.664
I cannot wait to give it to you.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.533
You got me a gift? I did.

03:54.535 --> 03:55.667
I-I look forward to opening it.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.869
I look forward to eating
at a restaurant

03:57.871 --> 04:00.005
where we definitely
have a reservation.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.574
And I can't believe that
I doubted for one second

04:02.576 --> 04:03.909
the power of your love.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.210
(doorbell rings) Mmm.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.878
You expecting somebody? Uh, no.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.146
I'm not. Are you?

04:09.516 --> 04:10.616
Mom.

04:10.618 --> 04:13.352
Stewart.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.687
What a surprise. Hi.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.522
Oh, my gosh. Lenore.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.857
Debbie. Oh. Hi.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.126
Grandma, what are you doing here?
My babies.

04:21.128 --> 04:22.361
(kissing)

04:22.363 --> 04:23.996
(chuckles)

04:24.732 --> 04:26.231
Hello, Dean.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.400
Mother.

04:28.402 --> 04:29.601
Hmm.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.803
Oh, I have so missed

04:31.805 --> 04:33.038
my little angel prince.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.741
I'm still your angel prince.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.142
Uh, we just
weren't expecting you.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.478
Well, I wanted it to be a surprise.
Good job.

04:39.480 --> 04:42.281
We are definitely surprised.

04:42.283 --> 04:43.815
Where's Pop Pop?
LENORE: Sweetie.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.450
Nigel is 45.

04:45.452 --> 04:46.985
He doesn't really
like to be called

04:46.987 --> 04:48.754
Pop Pop. Sorry.

04:48.756 --> 04:50.889
Did you hear about
Grandpa's malpractice case?

04:52.426 --> 04:54.559
Yes, I did.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.994
I did.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.996
That's why I'm here.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.765
You heard about
the case in Paris?

04:59.767 --> 05:01.667
(groans) It's so much bigger
than I thought.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.934
Well,

05:02.936 --> 05:04.770
Mom, you don't have to worry,

05:04.772 --> 05:07.673
because Stew and I
are both handling Dad's defense.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.009
Oh, God, please tell me he's not
still pretending to be a lawyer.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.444
Eh...

05:12.446 --> 05:13.945
That depends
on whether you think

05:13.947 --> 05:15.614
a certified legal intern

05:15.616 --> 05:18.784
with in-court speaking
privileges, is pretending.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.485
I do. Then I guess I am.

05:20.487 --> 05:23.455
So that, uh, show...
It won't take you back?

05:23.457 --> 05:25.757
(sighs)
It was never about that, Mom.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.092
Of course,
there's really no need

05:27.094 --> 05:30.262
since Timothy Olyphant
is so fabulous.

05:30.264 --> 05:31.797
You know, Mom, we should get your bags...
Take your things upstairs.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.599
Okay, everybody just sit down.

05:34.601 --> 05:37.636
You don't think Timothy Olyphant
is that fabulous.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.970
You're just trying
to rub my nose in it,

05:38.972 --> 05:42.441
because you've never approved
of my lifestyle choices.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.510
Because you ran off to Hollywood
to chase some pipe dream,

05:45.512 --> 05:46.812
instead of settling down...

05:46.814 --> 05:47.879
Settling down like my brother.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.181
Well, I'm engaged.

05:50.718 --> 05:51.783
Is this true?

05:52.653 --> 05:54.619
Yeah. Yeah, I mean...

05:54.621 --> 05:55.520
T-tell... yeah.

05:55.522 --> 05:56.655
So engaged. Sure.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.156
Yeah. No, we're still all just

05:58.158 --> 05:59.491
kind of processing it.
That's true.

05:59.493 --> 06:01.693
Oh, Deanie!

06:01.695 --> 06:04.329
Finally. Huh?

06:04.331 --> 06:05.464
Well, who is she?

06:05.466 --> 06:06.732
Tell me everything.

06:09.169 --> 06:10.969
Her name's Claire.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.170
Oh, no. Oh, not that.

06:12.172 --> 06:13.805
Well, I'm excited to meet her.

06:18.312 --> 06:19.978
LENORE:
I always did enjoy this view.

06:21.315 --> 06:24.182
Well, I'll be damned.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.183
Hello, Dean.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.386
Hello, Lenore.

06:27.388 --> 06:28.720
What are you doing here?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.823
I came to visit my family.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.058
How's Nigel?

06:33.060 --> 06:34.826
He's wonderful.

06:36.397 --> 06:37.362
So you seeing anyone?

06:37.364 --> 06:39.431
Uh, yeah.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.333
Here and there. Nothing serious.

06:41.335 --> 06:43.535
I definitely got
some irons in the fire.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.604
Well, good for you.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.707
No, I understand
you have no tables, Alex,

06:48.709 --> 06:50.108
but as I was saying,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.177
this is kind of
a special occasion for me,

06:52.179 --> 06:54.379
and I'm in a bit of a pinch,
so...

06:54.381 --> 06:55.747
(groans) Hung up.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.582
So you did forget.
I totally forgot.

06:57.584 --> 06:58.717
And you lied about it. Yeah.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.018
And now you're scrambling,

07:00.020 --> 07:01.686
'cause that place is booked.
You nailed it.

07:01.688 --> 07:02.721
Do you want me to make a call?

07:02.723 --> 07:03.889
Yes. Would you do that?

07:03.891 --> 07:06.758
Maybe. Depends. On what?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.894
On your willingness
to do something for me.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.797
Well, Dean, I kind of
can't say no to you right now.

07:11.799 --> 07:14.032
Good. Just a couple things.
Pretty easy stuff.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.902
Number one: I need you
to tell Mom I'm a real lawyer.

07:16.904 --> 07:18.770
Went to law school. Whole thing.
She'll never believe that.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.739
Number two: I'm engaged. Yeah,
about the engagement, Dean.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.408
And you need to get Claire
on board, 'cause I can't do it.

07:23.410 --> 07:25.410
I've already harassed her
enough. I agreed I would stop.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.579
Good. No one should be
harassing anybody.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.448
Good. Good. J-just talk to her.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.582
Just tell her
she's got to do this

07:30.584 --> 07:32.451
or she gets fired or something.

07:32.453 --> 07:34.152
Dean, that is
the definition of harassment.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.588
No, it's not.
That's very specific language.

07:36.590 --> 07:40.559
That's, "Have sex with me or
you're fired." No, that's not it.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.160
No, it's a much narrower
definition than people realize.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.862
I mean, you-you can
get away with a lot.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.570
Uh, so Dean
may have told our mother

07:51.572 --> 07:52.838
that he is

07:52.840 --> 07:54.506
engaged, uh, to you.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.074
Oh, come on. I know.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.909
I'm sorry, uh, uh, I panicked.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.511
This is harassment.
You-you know this, right?

07:59.513 --> 08:00.946
Actually... It is. 100%.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.180
You're absolutely right.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.782
Dean, we shouldn't even be here.

08:03.784 --> 08:04.916
Claire, please.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.017
Don't be annoying about this.

08:06.019 --> 08:07.118
It's just until she leaves town.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.820
There's no way
that I'm pretending

08:08.822 --> 08:11.456
to be your fiancée
to fool your mother.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.692
I was afraid you might
take that tact.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.594
Stew, do you want
to tell her what

08:15.596 --> 08:17.095
the repercussions are
of that decision?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.563
You're not fired. You're fired.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.602
Oh, God!

08:23.604 --> 08:28.540
¶ Everybody needs
a little time away... ¶

08:28.542 --> 08:30.041
LIZZIE: Hey, Grandpa,

08:30.043 --> 08:30.842
are you okay?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.143
Guys, not now.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.812
It's Grandma, isn't it?

08:33.814 --> 08:35.480
I thought I said not now.

08:35.482 --> 08:37.282
Seeing her again has you
all torn up inside.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.450
It's written

08:38.452 --> 08:39.551
all over your face.

08:39.553 --> 08:40.819
Yeah? So what?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.821
Go after her.
Give her your heart.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.489
Are you nuts?

08:44.491 --> 08:45.891
I don't want her back.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.158
I just want her to hate herself.

08:47.160 --> 08:50.061
Because she's moved on
and you haven't?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.563
Emotions are still raw, huh?

08:51.565 --> 08:53.832
Yeah, I guess they are.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.634
Grandpa?

08:55.636 --> 08:57.369
Let us help you.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.572
I mean, (scoffs) damn it.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.673
This isn't... (scoffs)

09:01.675 --> 09:03.341
DEAN: Ooh, I know that sound.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.077
That is the sound of frustration
that only shows its face

09:06.079 --> 09:07.879
when you're online shopping.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.147
What are you talking about?

09:09.149 --> 09:11.816
You didn't get him a gift,
did you?

09:11.818 --> 09:13.518
Uh, yeah, I did.
Then show it to me.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.853
What did you get him?
No, I... uh...

09:14.855 --> 09:16.221
Okay, I didn't...
I didn't get him anything.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.589
Because I can't think
of what to get him.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.724
Please don't say anything.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.192
I think he should know.

09:21.194 --> 09:23.428
What do you want?

09:23.430 --> 09:26.064
Okay, so Stew was unable
to convince Claire

09:26.066 --> 09:28.199
to pretend to be my fiancée,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.200
so I need you

09:29.202 --> 09:32.003
to back up the story
with my mom.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.238
How? I mean, if Claire says
you're not engaged,

09:33.240 --> 09:34.606
isn't it over?

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
No. Not if my mom thinks Claire

09:36.043 --> 09:38.076
was intimidated
into hiding the engagement.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.511
By whom? Todd.

09:39.513 --> 09:41.046
Her jealous ex-boyfriend.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.547
Of course.
How did I not see that coming?

09:42.549 --> 09:43.548
He's a danger to himself.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.849
Uh-huh. And others.

09:44.851 --> 09:47.085
Dean, don't you think
that's a little convoluted?

09:47.087 --> 09:49.220
Fine.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.789
Stew! No, no, no, no.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.023
(whispering): No. I'll do it.

09:52.025 --> 09:54.159
STEWART: What? I'm in.

09:55.729 --> 09:57.429
Uh, I just wanted
to say good night.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.698
STEWART: Okay. Good night.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.333
Love you.

10:03.604 --> 10:05.604
Love you!

10:05.606 --> 10:08.540
STEWART: Love you too.

10:08.542 --> 10:10.041
(door opens)

10:10.043 --> 10:12.210
Who's your father dating? What?

10:12.212 --> 10:13.912
He already told me
there's someone.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.080
Who is it?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.247
I have no idea, Mom.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.582
He's not dating anybody.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.618
You don't think I can handle it.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.319
Why wouldn't you be able
to handle it?

10:22.990 --> 10:24.289
Nigel left me.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.590
Oh, Mom.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.925
Really? When?

10:26.927 --> 10:28.760
He found out I cheated on him

10:28.762 --> 10:29.928
about a month ago.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.097
That you... oh. Yeah.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.632
I'm sorry to hear that.

10:33.634 --> 10:34.799
It was a rough week.

10:35.602 --> 10:36.701
But I'm moving on.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.838
Oh, you want to get back
together with Dad.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.740
No, I'm...

10:41.742 --> 10:42.941
I'm not getting involved
with it, Mom.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.109
No way. No way.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.510
Okay.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.145
I'll try not to get involved

10:47.147 --> 10:48.913
in Debbie finding out

10:48.915 --> 10:50.949
that you forgot
your anniversary.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.585
No. I didn't. I didn't forget.

10:53.587 --> 10:55.320
I made a reservation. Okay.

10:56.023 --> 10:57.522
Okay.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.923
Mom, wait.

11:00.027 --> 11:01.793
What do you want?

11:01.795 --> 11:04.295
And we're live.
What is that thing?

11:04.297 --> 11:05.330
Well, it's an app
that let's you meet

11:05.332 --> 11:06.965
other single adults
in your area.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.933
Yeah, and that's what's
called your profile.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.669
Why does that picture
have me in my army uniform?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.803
LIZZIE:
Because you look handsome in it.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.171
ETHAN: Grandpa.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.606
You're selling yourself
to these people.

11:14.608 --> 11:16.608
Everybody fudges
the facts a little bit.

11:16.610 --> 11:18.977
(computer dings)
Let me see that. Ooh.

11:18.979 --> 11:19.978
What did I do?

11:19.980 --> 11:21.613
LIZZIE: Oh, okay,
so what happened there

11:21.615 --> 11:23.148
was you just "liked" Calista.

11:23.150 --> 11:24.816
Isn't she a little young?

11:24.818 --> 11:27.819
LIZZIE: Well, yeah,
if this photo's even accurate.

11:27.821 --> 11:28.787
I mean, she probably looks
nothing like this.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.055
Now what?

11:30.057 --> 11:32.123
Now we just wait.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.492
And pray to God
that she likes you back.

11:34.494 --> 11:35.794
(computer dings)

11:35.796 --> 11:37.662
What does that mean?

11:37.664 --> 11:39.064
That means we're in business.

11:39.066 --> 11:41.700
Really? Todd?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.301
He always seemed so sweet.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.235
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.004
Yep, that's what
we thought, too.

11:46.006 --> 11:48.973
And then we found out that
he has been hiding a dark side.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.975
Like, a very dark side

11:50.977 --> 11:53.211
and sad.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.813
Well, that explains
why Claire denied it

11:54.815 --> 11:56.214
when I congratulated her.

11:56.216 --> 11:56.981
Yes. That is...

11:56.983 --> 11:59.651
that is exactly why.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.086
(thumping)

12:01.088 --> 12:03.054
Toner!

12:03.857 --> 12:05.123
Darn it!

12:07.360 --> 12:07.992
(door slams) Oh, my,

12:07.994 --> 12:09.360
so Todd is a violent,

12:09.362 --> 12:11.863
jealous, maniac.

12:11.865 --> 12:12.831
But he still works here?

12:12.833 --> 12:14.332
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

12:14.334 --> 12:17.035
He's a damn good lawyer.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.003
Oh, sorry.
I just need to grab something.

12:19.005 --> 12:22.240
And I need
to grab something, too. (Sighs)

12:22.242 --> 12:24.509
And it's you.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.877
Wh... why? It's okay.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.012
Deb told me about Todd.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.180
What about Todd?

12:29.182 --> 12:30.448
Oh, you know... just...

12:30.450 --> 12:33.384
how he's your abusive ex,

12:33.386 --> 12:34.619
and that's why
you couldn't tell Lenore

12:34.621 --> 12:36.554
about your engagement to Dean.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.555
Seriously?

12:37.557 --> 12:39.023
I am so relieved

12:39.025 --> 12:40.725
the cat is finally
out of the bag.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.561
Yeah, I'm very uncomfortable
about it all still.

12:43.563 --> 12:46.197
Well, it's okay.
I won't say anything.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.298
And she is a woman of her word.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.100
We should celebrate.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.136
I want to take you both
to dinner.

12:51.138 --> 12:53.419
Oh, that would be great. Nope,
not necessary in the least.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.812
I cannot believe that we are
eating at this restaurant.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.380
Honey, I told you.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.915
I've had this reservaysh
for months,

13:03.917 --> 13:06.551
because our anniversary
is very important to me.

13:06.553 --> 13:08.319
Uh-huh.
And you didn't have any help

13:08.321 --> 13:10.121
getting this reservaysh?

13:10.123 --> 13:13.158
I'm sorry. Are you implying
that I used my older brother

13:13.160 --> 13:14.926
to pull strings
to get us this table,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.161
because I forgot
our anniversary?

13:16.163 --> 13:19.330
Honey, that is exactly
what I'm implying.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.999
Or are you projecting, maybe,

13:21.001 --> 13:22.767
because you forgot? No.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.936
Because I don't see
a gift anywhere.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.471
Uh, yeah,
because I wouldn't bring

13:26.473 --> 13:29.808
your amazing gift
to this restaurant.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.242
I'm telling you, it is...

13:31.244 --> 13:34.279
insane. Oh, I bet. I bet.

13:34.281 --> 13:36.181
Hi, uh, Dean Sanderson
for three.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.415
MANAGER: I'll have a look, sir.

13:37.417 --> 13:38.917
Thanks. What the...?

13:38.919 --> 13:40.285
Uh, Dean.

13:40.287 --> 13:41.853
Hi.

13:41.855 --> 13:44.322
What are you, uh...
what are you doing here?

13:44.324 --> 13:45.590
Uh, we're just having dinner.

13:45.592 --> 13:48.293
My fiancée, Claire,
and-and Mom and I.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.328
I-I told you. You did
tell me, of course.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.996
I just...
I didn't realize it was out.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.464
Yes. What a relief.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.933
Deb told me all about Todd.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.501
He sounds like
a complete lunatic.

13:56.503 --> 13:59.037
Todd is. Yeah, you know,

13:59.039 --> 14:00.471
that's why I couldn't talk
about this About the...

14:00.473 --> 14:03.141
at the office.
Right. Right. Yes.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.977
Crazy Todd.
I forgot... I forgot that piece.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.214
It's kind of an important piece.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.150
ETHAN: <i>I would say, above all,</i>

14:12.152 --> 14:13.484
be yourself.

14:13.486 --> 14:14.853
What if that's not good enough?

14:14.855 --> 14:15.887
That's why we
have this earpiece.

14:15.889 --> 14:17.355
ETHAN: We got you.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.657
We'll talk you through it.
I don't know.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.594
Come on. What could go wrong?

14:27.234 --> 14:28.366
Help yourself to
anything on the menu.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.034
I'm buying.

14:30.036 --> 14:33.004
Yeah, I haven't paid
for a meal in, like, years.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.740
You look a hell of a lot
like your picture.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.509
Yeah, I took it yesterday.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.678
And it looks like yours
was maybe taken...

14:40.680 --> 14:42.046
A couple of years ago. Yeah.

14:42.048 --> 14:44.048
Oh. (Laughs) Okay.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.650
What the...?

14:47.988 --> 14:49.187
Are you okay?

14:49.189 --> 14:50.421
My son's here

14:50.423 --> 14:52.857
with my ex-wife.

14:52.859 --> 14:55.927
So...?

14:55.929 --> 14:57.161
Is that my dad?

14:57.163 --> 14:58.396
He's here, too.

14:58.398 --> 14:59.697
What is going on tonight?
Oh, my God.

14:59.699 --> 15:01.366
That must be that woman
he met online.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.368
Since when does he know
how to get online?

15:03.370 --> 15:05.336
Oh, the kids taught him.
They made like a profile and...

15:05.338 --> 15:06.337
Oh, that's not a woman.

15:06.339 --> 15:07.672
That is a girl.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.274
That is a young, very hot girl.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.441
Really hot.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.377
Like, very hot.
Like, smokin' hot.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.178
Okay. We get it. Thank you.

15:14.180 --> 15:15.847
DEAN:
So, Claire and I were thinking

15:15.849 --> 15:17.448
of a June wedding.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.383
Isn't that right, sweetheart?

15:18.385 --> 15:19.951
Yeah, sure.

15:19.953 --> 15:20.952
Well, that's great, dear.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.186
She wanted to do it earlier,

15:22.188 --> 15:24.522
but I said,
this law profession for me

15:24.524 --> 15:25.890
is-is the real thing.
I can't just up and get married

15:25.892 --> 15:27.392
in the middle of legal season.

15:27.394 --> 15:28.893
Legal season?

15:28.895 --> 15:31.529
Yeah. No, no, no. Absolutely.

15:31.531 --> 15:32.897
Lenore, are you okay?

15:32.899 --> 15:34.232
I don't believe it.

15:34.234 --> 15:35.366
Okay. We lied.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.401
What?

15:36.403 --> 15:37.635
Wh-What?

15:39.439 --> 15:40.905
I'm sorry, what were
you talking about?

15:40.907 --> 15:41.906
Your father.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.142
He's here with that
new girlfriend of his.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.576
What were you talking about?
Nothing.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.644
He has a girlfriend?

15:47.414 --> 15:48.546
Nice pull, Pop.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.214
Pull-pop.

15:50.216 --> 15:52.183
Is that doing anything for you?
Not at all.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.386
Oh, I get it.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.422
You're using me
to make your ex jealous.

15:57.424 --> 15:58.756
What?

15:58.758 --> 15:59.891
No. No, no. I wouldn't...

15:59.893 --> 16:01.592
LIZZIE:
Okay, it's okay, Grandpa.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.428
Calm down. Just tell her
that you didn't know

16:03.430 --> 16:04.462
that she was even...
Give me that.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.830
Just say this, Grandpa:

16:05.832 --> 16:07.598
"Calista, I swear..."

16:07.600 --> 16:09.600
to God, I had no idea.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.935
Is that an earpiece?

16:10.937 --> 16:12.103
LIZZIE: Uh, uh, tell her
it's a hearing aid.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.271
What?

16:13.273 --> 16:15.006
Keep saying "what."
Yeah, and, uh, talk loud.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.391
What?!

16:16.392 --> 16:17.775
Is someone telling you what
to say through that thing?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.411
I think you're talking
about my hearing aid,

16:20.413 --> 16:22.613
but it's acting up a little bit,

16:22.615 --> 16:23.848
and I can't hear you.

16:23.850 --> 16:26.084
Stewart, you need
to do something.

16:26.086 --> 16:27.602
Things are
progressing over there.

16:27.603 --> 16:29.119
Huh?! STEWART: Mom,
they're really not.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.322
Besides, this is
our anniversary dinner.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.957
You know, we do this
one night a year.

16:32.959 --> 16:34.258
I mean,
what do you want him to do?

16:34.260 --> 16:35.393
Oh, he knows.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.533
Okay. I'm going.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.303
Pick up for Todd.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.704
One moment, please.

16:46.706 --> 16:47.972
Oh, my God.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.140
Claire's maniac

16:49.142 --> 16:50.708
ex-boyfriend is here.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.143
He must have followed us.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.112
I cannot believe
this is happening.

16:54.114 --> 16:54.979
Oh, you said it yourself.

16:54.981 --> 16:56.214
He's dangerous.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.116
We have to get Claire
out of here.

16:58.118 --> 16:59.050
Lenore, listen,
I got to tell you...

16:59.052 --> 17:00.785
Yes, yes, yes. Okay. Okay.

17:00.787 --> 17:01.886
Dad. Hi.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.988
Um, what are you doing here?

17:03.990 --> 17:05.390
Well, I'm having dinner
with a lady friend.

17:05.392 --> 17:06.391
This is Calista.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.860
Hi. Hi, Calista.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.295
Uh, I'm not sure
what's going on here,

17:11.297 --> 17:12.497
Oh, yeah. It's weird.

17:12.499 --> 17:13.664
STEWART: It's totally weird.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.734
And maybe it could happen
at not here.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.169
Um, okay, h-how do I say this?

17:18.171 --> 17:19.804
Y-you're doing great.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.239
But I-I feel like
there are moments

17:21.241 --> 17:23.174
where you're
a little see-through.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.510
Oh, no. Please tell me
so that I can fix them.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.678
I love that attitude...
Such a worker bee.

17:27.680 --> 17:29.347
It's in your culture, isn't it?

17:29.349 --> 17:30.648
I'm sorry, what?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.750
Claire, he's here.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.185
Your ex. Who?

17:34.187 --> 17:35.520
You know, your ex.

17:35.522 --> 17:37.255
Your crazy ex, Todd,
who stalks you.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.324
Todd, what are you doing here?

17:40.326 --> 17:42.360
I was just picking up some food.
Small world, huh?

17:42.362 --> 17:44.262
How dare you come here.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.530
I mean, open your eyes.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.198
Claire has moved on.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.267
She's with Dean now. What?

17:49.269 --> 17:50.268
Claire and I have never been...

17:50.270 --> 17:51.502
(groans) Dean!

17:51.504 --> 17:53.504
Oh, my God.

17:53.506 --> 17:55.706
Excuse me, what in the hell
is going on here?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.542
Th-This man is my fiancée's

17:57.544 --> 17:59.544
violent ex-boyfriend,
and he was about to attack her.

17:59.546 --> 18:00.778
What? What happened?

18:00.780 --> 18:01.946
Dean just punched Todd.

18:01.948 --> 18:03.548
Great shot, Deano.

18:03.550 --> 18:04.449
What is happening?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.450
Why are you helping him?

18:05.452 --> 18:06.751
Dean, you want to answer that?

18:08.354 --> 18:09.887
I'm calling the police.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.189
Dean? What?

18:11.191 --> 18:12.824
Don't you think this
has gone far enough?

18:13.893 --> 18:15.093
What is he talking about?

18:16.196 --> 18:17.196
Oh, my face.

18:21.201 --> 18:23.468
Mom,
I have a confession to make.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.572
Todd is not
her jealous ex-fiancé.

18:27.574 --> 18:29.707
He's just a messenger
at the firm.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.741
What? I'm a lawyer.

18:30.743 --> 18:33.377
And Claire is not my fiancée.

18:33.379 --> 18:34.212
Not in the least.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.379
DEAN: I lied,

18:35.381 --> 18:36.414
because I wanted you
to be proud of me.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.050
And for a second, I was.

18:39.052 --> 18:40.151
I know.

18:40.153 --> 18:41.385
It was almost working,

18:41.387 --> 18:43.121
but I got caught up in the lies,

18:43.123 --> 18:44.622
and then-then
I lost myself in it,

18:44.624 --> 18:48.226
and I became someone I'm not.

18:48.228 --> 18:51.796
I am so very disappointed
in you, Dean.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.532
I lied, too.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.769
I did not make the reservation
two months ago.

18:58.771 --> 19:01.606
Honey, I completely
forgot our anniversary.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.342
I know. I lied, too.

19:04.344 --> 19:07.111
I also forgot our anniversary.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.447
I got something. Calista,

19:09.449 --> 19:12.116
that picture of me
was taken quite a while ago.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.618
I'm actually an old man.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.853
Okay.

19:15.855 --> 19:16.954
I was trying

19:16.956 --> 19:17.922
to make you jealous.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.390
Well, it worked.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.660
Mom?

19:25.965 --> 19:27.632
Nigel left me.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.034
I wasn't here for the case.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.536
I was here for you.

19:31.538 --> 19:32.970
Yeah, it's working!

19:32.972 --> 19:35.106
DEAN SR.:
I'm flattered, but look at us.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.874
We both know this doesn't work.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.677
Too complicated.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.313
I like complicated.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.948
I like simple.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.423
Oh, my gosh.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.398
DEBBIE: So, this is happening?

20:00.400 --> 20:02.133
Right-right next to us.

20:02.135 --> 20:03.834
It's... (moaning)

20:03.836 --> 20:05.236
very passionate.

20:11.044 --> 20:12.476
Bye, Grandma. Come back soon.
Bye-bye, sweetie.

20:12.478 --> 20:14.145
Bye, Grandma. Bye, sweetheart.

20:14.147 --> 20:16.847
Mom.

20:16.849 --> 20:17.748
Are you sure you have to go?

20:17.750 --> 20:19.584
I'm afraid so.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.018
Yeah, I'm sorry
about last night, Mom.

20:21.020 --> 20:23.154
That was, uh, unfortunate.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.089
Oh, no, Stew.
I-I think it was good.

20:25.091 --> 20:27.592
I think that the truth brought
us all closer together.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.360
It sure did.

20:29.362 --> 20:30.995
I had sex with your father.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.957
Oh, that's great news.
Right in front of the kids.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.199
Nothing makes me happier.

20:35.201 --> 20:37.335
So you and Grandpa
are getting back together?

20:37.337 --> 20:38.436
LIZZIE: Yeah, because,
I mean, you only have sex

20:38.438 --> 20:40.204
with someone
if you love them, right, Dad?

20:40.206 --> 20:41.706
That's 100% right, honey.

20:41.708 --> 20:42.873
100%.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.041
I feel like they're lying.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.710
Oh, really? I couldn't tell.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.778
Mom, I am so glad
that we did this.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.447
You coming here

20:49.449 --> 20:51.082
was the right move
at the right time.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.217
Yeah. It was just
what we needed.

20:53.219 --> 20:54.952
Your presence this week

20:54.954 --> 20:57.088
completely changed the dynamic,

20:57.090 --> 20:58.889
and it felt really good
to focus on the family.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.191
Well, it makes me proud

21:00.193 --> 21:01.859
to hear you say that.

21:01.861 --> 21:05.062
As proud as you've ever been

21:05.064 --> 21:06.497
of one of your sons?

21:11.437 --> 21:12.536
Sure, Dean.

21:12.538 --> 21:15.539
I knew it.

21:18.478 --> 21:20.511
