00:12.100 --> 00:13.200
Narrator: Coming up...

00:13.200 --> 00:15.133
why is Joe doing
some heavy lifting?

00:15.133 --> 00:16.567
Sal: Oh, my God!

00:16.567 --> 00:18.767
Narrator:
What's got Murr wigging out?

00:18.767 --> 00:20.767
I know --
dude, I'm embarrassed.

00:22.367 --> 00:23.933
Narrator:
And which punished Joker

00:23.933 --> 00:26.233
will wish the genie was never
let out of the bottle?

00:27.767 --> 00:28.867
**

00:28.867 --> 00:31.700
Sal:
Prepare for something amazing.

00:31.700 --> 00:32.767
Q: Hey, mustache, what's up?

00:34.467 --> 00:36.100
Murr:
I want my mommy!

00:37.900 --> 00:40.633
Sal:
I will never forgive you!

00:40.633 --> 00:42.667
Joe: Larry!

00:46.400 --> 00:49.233
Today, we're at the mall
asking people to sign up

00:49.233 --> 00:51.500
for a chance to win
a $100 gift card.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.167
The catch is
they'll have to give us

00:53.167 --> 00:54.900
their cellphone number
to be eligible,

00:54.900 --> 00:57.400
and once we have their number,
that's when the fun begins.

00:57.400 --> 00:59.800
Because the other guys
will be sending the contestant

00:59.800 --> 01:01.067
weird texts on our behalf.

01:01.067 --> 01:03.067
The guy that gets
the fewest responses

01:03.067 --> 01:05.467
back from that person
loses.

01:05.467 --> 01:08.833
**

01:08.833 --> 01:10.067
Murr: What do I look like?

01:10.067 --> 01:12.167
I look so stupid.

01:12.167 --> 01:13.967
He forgot he was gonna be
wearing this hair.

01:13.967 --> 01:15.600
Joe: In case you've been
living under a rock,

01:15.600 --> 01:17.167
this is why Murray's hair
looks like this.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.433
**

01:18.433 --> 01:22.067
Sal: Murr, he will be wearing
Q's hair as a wig.

01:22.067 --> 01:25.867
Sal: Oh, my God!

01:25.867 --> 01:29.133
Oh, my God.
I feel like such an ass

01:30.867 --> 01:34.100
Guys, they're giving
away a $100 gift card
every 15 minutes

01:34.100 --> 01:35.200
if you're
in the food court.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.533
Do you guys
want to sign up for it?

01:36.533 --> 01:37.833
It's super easy.

01:37.833 --> 01:38.767
We're in, we're in!

01:38.767 --> 01:39.967
Ow, that hurt actually,
kind of.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.100
It did, it did, actually,
believe it or not.

01:41.100 --> 01:42.300
You got to --
you got to work out.

01:42.300 --> 01:44.067
Thanks, enjoy.
You got it.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.300
Here's the text, buddy.

01:46.300 --> 01:49.067
Murr can see everything
we're texting.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.500
And he wrote back
"Thank you."

01:51.500 --> 01:52.567
All right, Murr --
you're already at one.

01:52.567 --> 01:54.100
There you go.
I got a response.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.467
What am "I" texting them?

01:58.433 --> 02:00.567
Sal: You guys lift?
You got muscles AF.

02:00.567 --> 02:02.500
I can't even look.

02:07.233 --> 02:08.900
Joe: He's laughing.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.567
Yeah, you're good.

02:10.567 --> 02:12.333
Sal: He's writing back!
He's writing back!

02:12.333 --> 02:13.467
LMAO.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.533
You got a double.
He got a double off of one!

02:16.533 --> 02:17.833
Yeah, he got a two-for-one
on that one, buddy.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.333
So you're up to three already,
Murr.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.133
This is so embarrassing.

02:22.133 --> 02:24.533
All right, Murr --
I just sent one.

02:24.533 --> 02:26.300
Oh, my gosh.

02:26.300 --> 02:28.500
-He sent it. He's got it.
-All right, here we go.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.300
Murr:
Oh, my God.

02:35.833 --> 02:37.600
He wrote back, "Um sure."

02:37.600 --> 02:40.467
He keeps answering.

02:40.467 --> 02:41.567
Sent.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.467
I can't even look.

02:43.467 --> 02:44.933
Is he looking at his phone?

02:51.067 --> 02:54.067
This guy's the best.
I love this guy.

02:54.067 --> 02:56.433
He's writing back,
though!

02:56.433 --> 02:57.667
"Oo word"?

02:58.633 --> 02:59.700
Sal: This is --

02:59.700 --> 03:00.833
Now what are you writing?

03:00.833 --> 03:01.767
What are you writing?

03:03.567 --> 03:06.067
"Just get my pretzel,
fool."

03:09.467 --> 03:12.267
Sal:
Did you see that look?

03:12.267 --> 03:14.733
"Fool" is rough.

03:14.733 --> 03:17.667
-Maybe he's reached --
-Ohh, man.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.467
His whole demeanor changed.
Oh, my God.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.100
Are you serious?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.733
Joe: He's leaving.
He's had enough.

03:22.733 --> 03:24.533
So, the "fool"
was too much.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.567
Come on!

03:25.567 --> 03:27.733
-That's it.
-All right, Murr.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.767
Sal: You look like --
you're beet red, dude.

03:29.767 --> 03:31.400
I know --
dude, I'm embarrassed.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.433
Joe: Five replies.

03:34.467 --> 03:36.667
Hey, so, we're doing
a contest today.

03:36.667 --> 03:38.233
We're giving away
a $100 gift card.

03:38.233 --> 03:40.100
You interested?

03:40.100 --> 03:41.500
All you got to do is write
your name, phone number,

03:41.500 --> 03:43.067
and they'll text you
if you won.
He's ready to go.

03:43.067 --> 03:45.467
Here you go.
Q: Thank you very much.

03:45.467 --> 03:46.500
Text has been sent.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.933
We wrote,
"Hi Vlad, it's Brian.

03:48.933 --> 03:50.067
Good luck on the contest."

03:50.067 --> 03:51.833
So, I'm gonna send this text
to this guy now.

03:55.767 --> 03:57.967
Sal:

04:01.767 --> 04:02.933
He made a "what the f--,"

04:02.933 --> 04:04.133
"what the hell is this guy
talking about."

04:04.133 --> 04:06.267
**

04:10.667 --> 04:11.733
Q: That's one.

04:14.567 --> 04:16.067
Murr: This -- this...
Sal: Three in a row!

04:16.067 --> 04:17.267
Joe:
This guy is a texter.

04:17.267 --> 04:18.833
Every thought
is a separate text.

04:18.833 --> 04:20.133
He's like my mother.
Yeah.

04:22.367 --> 04:23.400
Send it. Send it,
send it, send it.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.933
Horse emoji?

04:28.933 --> 04:31.567
Joe:
"Deliver that yum yums."

04:38.067 --> 04:39.633
"Enough talk, bucko.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.233
Give me dem leftovers."

04:41.233 --> 04:43.067
Sal:

04:43.067 --> 04:45.333
He has a face of disgust!

04:52.833 --> 04:56.133
**

04:57.267 --> 04:59.167
Here it is, here it is,
here it is, here it is,

04:59.167 --> 05:00.767
here it is, here it is,
here it is.

05:02.067 --> 05:03.533
Oh, cool, are you done?

05:03.533 --> 05:05.567
I-I'll take it.

05:05.567 --> 05:06.833
No, you don't
have to buy me something.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.200
Just, if you're done, I'll just
hoover that right down.

05:10.833 --> 05:13.167
I'll take it.
I'm not proud.
You sure?

05:13.167 --> 05:14.400
Yeah, thank you.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.667
Sweet.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.100
What a nice guy.

05:17.100 --> 05:19.400
Joe: Six texts.
And a free salad.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.267
Wow.

05:22.500 --> 05:25.167
They are giving away
a $100 gift card

05:25.167 --> 05:26.833
every 15 minutes.

05:28.833 --> 05:30.133
Joe: Here we go, Sal.

05:31.500 --> 05:33.300
Murr:
First text sent.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.167
He just got it.

05:35.167 --> 05:36.267
Here you go.
He's writing back.

05:37.867 --> 05:38.967
Q: Okay.
What was that?

05:38.967 --> 05:39.933
"Okay" emoji.
Okay.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.233
Okay, got it?

05:42.567 --> 05:44.300
You ready, dudes?

05:44.300 --> 05:46.667
Yeah, here we go.
Here we go.

05:46.667 --> 05:47.767
That's the whole text?

05:47.767 --> 05:48.800
Oh, come on.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.833
"I imagine you have
all your teeth?"

05:53.300 --> 05:54.733
He's laughing!

05:56.733 --> 05:59.767
Joe:
"Yeah, all of them."
Q: He goes,
"Yeah, all of them."

06:01.267 --> 06:02.900
All right, sent.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.400
Joe: He got it,
he got it, he got it!

06:06.400 --> 06:08.067
Q: Here we go.
Here we go. He's looking.

06:08.067 --> 06:09.633
Sal: "Teef" with an "F"?

06:10.933 --> 06:12.967
Q: He's looking.

06:12.967 --> 06:14.100
Joe: Don't look.
Don't look.

06:19.367 --> 06:23.333
Joe's writing.
Joe's writing.

06:26.767 --> 06:28.133
"Look at me right now,
please,

06:28.133 --> 06:29.900
and don't stop looking
no matter what."

06:31.500 --> 06:32.633
He's reading the text.

06:34.767 --> 06:37.933
**

06:48.767 --> 06:50.433
Murr: He's still looking.

06:50.433 --> 06:51.800
Sal, one more time.
One more time.

06:51.800 --> 06:53.133
He will not stop looking.

06:53.133 --> 06:56.133
Tell him to stop looking,
man.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.367
All right,
I'm sending one to him.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.933
Murr: Look at this.
Look at this.

07:10.967 --> 07:12.300
We're like pen pals now.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.833
Huh, Sal's, like,
making a new friend?

07:13.833 --> 07:15.533
Well,
we're making a new friend.

07:15.533 --> 07:16.933
You guys have
a pleasant conversation with him

07:16.933 --> 07:18.333
all day long.
Sal:
No, no, no, no, no.

07:19.700 --> 07:22.800
All right, I just wrote,
"I lactate" and hit send, so...

07:25.067 --> 07:27.067
**

07:27.067 --> 07:28.900
Okay, turn around, Sal.
Turn around, turn around.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.633
**

07:33.833 --> 07:35.200
Oh, my God.

07:37.233 --> 07:38.933
Hi, hon.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.267
Murr: Oh, here we go!

07:40.267 --> 07:41.633
Joe: Did you sign up yet?

07:41.633 --> 07:43.133
We're running a contest --
gives a $100 gift card out.

07:43.133 --> 07:44.700
Yeah, all you got to do is give
your name and number,

07:44.700 --> 07:46.067
and they pick a winner
every 15 minutes.

07:46.067 --> 07:48.267
Uh, sure.
Yeah, great. Thanks.

07:48.267 --> 07:49.700
Murr: He's got her.

07:49.700 --> 07:51.267
Great, thank you so much.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.400
I'll send you a test text
so you get it.

07:52.400 --> 07:54.833
Enjoy your lunch.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.567
We got it.
And send.

07:57.567 --> 07:58.533
Here you go.

07:58.533 --> 08:00.367
Let's see
if she writes back.

08:00.367 --> 08:07.067
**

08:07.067 --> 08:08.267
Q: Oh!

08:08.267 --> 08:11.067
She just didn't write back.
So, that's okay.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.633
Joe, we're hitting send.

08:13.633 --> 08:15.067
Ooh.

08:15.067 --> 08:16.167
**

08:16.167 --> 08:18.867
Sal:
He sent her a hot link

08:18.867 --> 08:20.733
on how to date
someone with herpes.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.233
Never...

08:26.667 --> 08:27.833
Sal: Do you see
the look she gave him?

08:27.833 --> 08:30.300
She put it right back!

08:30.300 --> 08:32.533
Joe, I just sent her
a follow-up.

08:32.533 --> 08:33.967
"Oops I'm sorry!

08:33.967 --> 08:35.600
I meant that
for my mom's bf."

08:42.533 --> 08:44.067
And she just ignores it.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.433
That's so odd,

08:45.433 --> 08:46.533
because I sent her a link
to how to date with herpes

08:46.533 --> 08:48.100
and told her
my mother's boyfriend had it.

08:48.100 --> 08:49.367
I thought we'd be chitchatting
by now.

08:49.367 --> 08:50.867
We just sent
her another text saying,

08:50.867 --> 08:53.500
"Losing my hair.
Don't care."

08:53.500 --> 08:54.700
Sal:

08:54.700 --> 08:56.233
**

08:58.167 --> 08:59.400
Q: No response.

08:59.400 --> 09:00.733
She didn't go with it.

09:03.733 --> 09:07.067
Sal:
"Pay me some respect."

09:09.200 --> 09:11.733
Oh!

09:13.267 --> 09:14.733
Zero.
Zero, Joe.

09:14.733 --> 09:17.767
Zero.
Zero.

09:17.767 --> 09:18.767
Sal: She's getting up!

09:18.767 --> 09:21.133
What's she doing?

09:21.133 --> 09:22.700
-Oh, oh, oh!
-Oh, my God.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.067
Sal: She's coming over.

09:25.767 --> 09:27.067
Joe: Yeah, about
the herpes hot link

09:27.067 --> 09:28.667
about my mother
and then the apology?
Yeah.

09:28.667 --> 09:30.233
Yeah, and then it was about
my mom's boyfriend

09:30.233 --> 09:31.767
and I'm losing all my hair
and I don't care.

09:31.767 --> 09:33.167
Yeah, you didn't write back
once, though.

09:35.967 --> 09:37.267
Oh, okay.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.900
That's all right.
Absolutely.
Sorry.

09:39.900 --> 09:41.067
No worries.
You have a great day.

09:41.067 --> 09:42.700
Thanks.
Yeah.

09:42.700 --> 09:43.867
You didn't win.

09:43.867 --> 09:45.967
Sal: Zilch-oh-mundo!

09:45.967 --> 09:47.500
Narrator: Joe got ghosted,

09:47.500 --> 09:50.467
so he's first up
on the loser board.

09:50.467 --> 09:51.533
Today, we're teaming up

09:51.533 --> 09:53.233
and going head-to-head
at Food Bazaar

09:53.233 --> 09:55.167
playing a game we call
"Over the Shoulder."

09:55.167 --> 09:57.133
One guy will have to steal items
from a shopper's cart

09:57.133 --> 09:58.700
and throw them over his shoulder
to his teammate,

09:58.700 --> 09:59.800
who has to catch them.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.933
For every item
that your teammate catches,

10:01.933 --> 10:03.067
you get a point.

10:03.067 --> 10:05.233
But if you get caught,
or he drops it, game over.

10:05.233 --> 10:08.233
Whichever team
has the most points
at the end wins.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.167
**

10:11.167 --> 10:12.500
Joe: All right,
here we go, boys.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.000
Okay, it's Sal and Q.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.433
Oh, wait, no,
it's Sal and Murr.

10:15.433 --> 10:17.833
Sal: What?

10:17.833 --> 10:20.800
I can-- guys, I literally
cannot take him seriously.

10:21.867 --> 10:23.167
Sal can't keep
his  together.

10:23.167 --> 10:24.067
he can't even look at you.

10:24.067 --> 10:25.167
All right, here we go.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.300
Okay, ready, Sal?
He didn't notice.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.400
I'm gonna --

10:28.400 --> 10:29.767
**

10:29.767 --> 10:31.233
Joe: Ohh!

10:31.233 --> 10:32.200
Easy, easy. Be careful.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.467
Oh, my God!

10:36.900 --> 10:38.067
Now how do I hold this?

10:38.067 --> 10:39.733
This is hard to hold.
I don't know!

10:39.733 --> 10:41.500
Joe: Yeah, that's not
a good item to start.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.567
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, Sal.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.067
**

10:46.067 --> 10:47.667
Q: Oh!

10:47.667 --> 10:50.667
**

10:50.667 --> 10:52.800
Murr!
Murr! Don't throw that!

10:52.800 --> 10:54.533
I can't hold that!

10:54.533 --> 10:55.867
Joe:
No, no, look at me.

10:55.867 --> 10:57.700
You can't throw that
right now.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.667
I don't want his --

10:58.667 --> 11:01.167
I -- I default.

11:01.167 --> 11:02.433
You have to wait,
you stu--

11:05.167 --> 11:06.067
Yes!

11:06.067 --> 11:07.500
What --
He got a bounce!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.533
Q:
It was a good rim shot, man!

11:09.533 --> 11:11.967
He came at you with heat,
that squash.

11:11.967 --> 11:13.400
Great catch!

11:13.400 --> 11:15.067
Aw, dude, it knocked
the wind out of me.

11:15.067 --> 11:16.467
This thing's, like,
eight pounds.

11:16.467 --> 11:18.500
Q: He picked
a prize-winning kumquat.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.633
Sal, Sal! Sal! Sal.

11:20.633 --> 11:22.200
Sal:
You got to be careful.

11:27.067 --> 11:28.867
Joe: Sal, nice!

11:28.867 --> 11:30.400
That's three.
That's three.

11:30.400 --> 11:32.067
Psst.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.533
**

11:35.533 --> 11:36.700
Oh, he got something!

11:36.700 --> 11:37.733
Sal: Is that a tin can?

11:37.733 --> 11:39.233
I can't hold
that little thing.

11:39.233 --> 11:41.067
I need stuff
with a little bit of mass.

11:41.067 --> 11:44.067
Murr, it sounds to me like
Sal doesn't trust you...
Yes.

11:44.067 --> 11:46.100
...to pick out
something to throw.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.367
Don't listen to them, buddy.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.067
Here we go.
Murray's trying to sneak in.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.233
I don't really see him.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.567
Joe: Murr looks so anxious
shopping for meats.

11:56.167 --> 11:58.800
**

11:58.800 --> 12:00.667
Here we go, here we go!

12:00.667 --> 12:02.800
Q: Wide-open lane.
They are officially
Murray's bananas.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.500
This woman had bananas.

12:04.500 --> 12:05.900
Now she is
without bananas.

12:05.900 --> 12:11.500
**

12:13.067 --> 12:14.800
Joe: Yes!
He dropped it!

12:14.800 --> 12:16.367
You dropped --

12:16.367 --> 12:18.367
No good.
That's it, baby.

12:18.367 --> 12:19.767
No good!

12:19.767 --> 12:21.133
Three. Three.
Three.

12:21.133 --> 12:22.333
It's not gonna be
hard to beat.

12:22.333 --> 12:24.600
The problem wasn't even
that errant throw.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.733
It's the  kumquat
that you threw.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.400
This is a cakewalk
for us.

12:31.400 --> 12:32.767
We like each other,
we know how to work together...

12:32.767 --> 12:33.833
It's great.
...we work together well.

12:33.833 --> 12:35.100
I-I like you.

12:35.100 --> 12:36.667
My affection for Q

12:36.667 --> 12:38.533
is where the lines
are being drawn.
It's rubbing off, yeah.

12:38.533 --> 12:39.800
I think that's what it is,
Sal.

12:39.800 --> 12:41.467
I think
that's what it is.
All right.

12:43.567 --> 12:45.467
I have
your scarf and hat on.

12:45.467 --> 12:47.533
Rooty-toot-toot.
Let's do it!

12:49.400 --> 12:50.867
All right, let's do it.

12:50.867 --> 12:52.733
The game's on!

12:52.733 --> 12:53.833
That's us?
Can I --

12:53.833 --> 12:55.833
You can throw it at me.

12:55.833 --> 12:57.333
Sal:
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

12:58.600 --> 12:59.767
Now back down to you.
I got you.

12:59.767 --> 13:00.833
Joe: Ohh!

13:02.367 --> 13:04.533
-Oh!
-Ah!

13:04.533 --> 13:06.500
All right, so that's one --
a bag of lettuce.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.500
Keep tossing salads
down there, you two.

13:08.500 --> 13:09.533
Murr:

13:09.533 --> 13:11.333
Here we go --
Joey's eyeing it up.

13:11.333 --> 13:17.067
**

13:17.067 --> 13:18.667
Carrots!

13:18.667 --> 13:20.700
Murr:
She has no idea her carrots
are now in Joe's hands.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.733
Nice. What a slick move.

13:22.733 --> 13:24.167
Murr: Oh, oh!

13:24.167 --> 13:26.167
Q: All right,
we'll just let mom pass...

13:26.167 --> 13:28.633
**

13:28.633 --> 13:30.067
All right.

13:30.067 --> 13:32.267
Sal:
She's watching right now.

13:32.267 --> 13:33.267
Got it.

13:33.267 --> 13:34.900
Murr: Ohh!

13:34.900 --> 13:36.833
-So, we're on two.
-Two, baby.

13:36.833 --> 13:38.333
The carrots were like
Keyser Soze --

13:38.333 --> 13:39.733
she had no idea
what's going on.

13:39.733 --> 13:43.833
**

13:43.833 --> 13:45.900
Murr: Oh.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.133
He's got your number, Joey.

13:49.233 --> 13:50.233
Unattended cart, Joe.

13:50.233 --> 13:51.467
Oh, there's a lemon.

13:51.467 --> 13:52.833
There's a lemon.
Oh, a lemon?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.533
Let's grab that lemon.

13:54.533 --> 13:55.600
**

13:55.600 --> 13:56.833
Murr:
He's got the lemon.

13:56.833 --> 13:58.367
Okay, lemon, ready?
Lemon, lemon.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.067
Got it.

14:02.067 --> 14:04.467
**

14:04.467 --> 14:05.600
Sal:
Now we're tied up.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.567
You guys want one
with authority?

14:07.567 --> 14:10.067
There's a watermelon
in this guy's cart.

14:10.067 --> 14:11.600
Okay, let's see
what you got, tough guys.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.167
Don't...

14:13.167 --> 14:15.300
Make that number 4
a watermelon.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.700
I'll respect you
so much more.
Joe, get it.

14:19.167 --> 14:20.700
Go for the watermelon!

14:20.700 --> 14:21.900
Joe: Switch.

14:25.267 --> 14:28.567
Q:
Are you gonna be able to launch
a 20

14:28.567 --> 14:30.533
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

14:30.533 --> 14:33.200
Murr: If Q catches this,
they win.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.067
Oh, ho, ho.

14:35.067 --> 14:36.700
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

14:36.700 --> 14:38.467
For the win.
Oh, my God!

14:38.467 --> 14:45.067
**

14:46.133 --> 14:47.767
We win! We win!

14:53.333 --> 14:54.533
Oh, he's looking.

14:54.533 --> 14:56.100
He's completely baffled.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.267
He's going to get
another watermelon.
Oh, wait. We didn't win.

14:58.267 --> 15:00.667
We won.
We tied.

15:00.667 --> 15:02.633
But we didn't lose.

15:02.633 --> 15:04.200
We didn't lose.
It's a tie.

15:04.200 --> 15:06.567
**

15:08.100 --> 15:10.500
Narrator:
Nobody caught a loss,

15:10.500 --> 15:13.200
but Joe's still
tonight's big loser.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.767
Sal:
Well, our wish came true.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.467
Joe lost,
so for your punishment,

15:16.467 --> 15:18.467
we are at Curtain Call's
Kweskin Theater.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.500
Today, you're joining
a live stage production,

15:20.500 --> 15:21.967
and you'll be playing
a genie.

15:21.967 --> 15:23.600
Do I have lines?

15:23.600 --> 15:24.867
You only have one line.
Yeah?

15:24.867 --> 15:26.200
"Genie does as you wish."
Okay.

15:26.200 --> 15:27.167
We'll take care
of the blocking.

15:27.167 --> 15:28.533
Okay.
And the flying.

15:28.533 --> 15:29.867
I don't like that look.
You're gonna fly.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.233
I don't like that look.
Look at this look.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.200
Look at this look.
There's something
going on.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.233
Oh, there's something
going on.
Oh

15:34.233 --> 15:35.700
You're about to get
up.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.633
Q: Oh, boy, here we go.

15:39.633 --> 15:42.067
Murr: There's
a lot of people here.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.533
Sal: Oh, my God.

15:44.533 --> 15:47.067
Look at his stomach!
I thought you lost weight!

15:47.067 --> 15:49.467
Welcome, friends!

15:49.467 --> 15:50.500
All right, here we go.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.933
Okay, so,
an audience is here

15:51.933 --> 15:53.733
to see a play
called "Arabian Nights."

15:53.733 --> 15:54.933
It's our show.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.433
Joe is our genie,

15:56.433 --> 15:58.567
and we literally
control his movements.

15:58.567 --> 16:00.333
Let the show begin.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.233
All right.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.067
Show time.

16:04.067 --> 16:05.633
So, this is our friend
Chris O'Neill.

16:05.633 --> 16:07.567
He's a Broadway star from
"The Book of Mormon."

16:07.567 --> 16:09.367
**

16:09.367 --> 16:11.367
Life is tough.

16:11.367 --> 16:14.433
If only I were a prince.

16:14.433 --> 16:15.500
What's this junk?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.500
**

16:18.500 --> 16:20.100
Q: Oh, here comes Joey.

16:24.633 --> 16:25.733
Are you a genie?

16:25.733 --> 16:27.100
Yes.

16:28.900 --> 16:30.300
Can I wish
for anything I want?

16:30.300 --> 16:31.400
"Genie does as you wish."

16:31.400 --> 16:33.100
Genie does as you wish.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.167
Can you fly?

16:34.167 --> 16:36.067
Genie does as you wish.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.100
**

16:38.367 --> 16:39.367
Turkey jerky.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.400
He's stuck
in the spotlight.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.867
He's stuck
in his own spotlight.

16:45.867 --> 16:47.200
Can I wish
to marry the princess?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.767
Genie does as you wish.

16:54.067 --> 16:56.367
**

16:58.700 --> 17:01.333
Can I wish for
unmatchable power?

17:01.333 --> 17:03.767
Genie does as you wish.

17:07.833 --> 17:10.433
Sal: He looks so stupid.

17:10.433 --> 17:11.500
More than anything,

17:11.500 --> 17:13.333
I-I'd love
to marry the princess,

17:13.333 --> 17:14.800
but she has to marry
a prince

17:14.800 --> 17:16.433
and a prince
needs a palace.

17:16.433 --> 17:18.067
Genie?

17:18.067 --> 17:19.400
I wish for a palace.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.100
Genie does as you wish.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.967
**

17:25.433 --> 17:27.500
Sal: Look at the audience.

17:30.367 --> 17:33.433
Q: He has destroyed
the whole set.

17:35.500 --> 17:37.267
I got caught
right in the throat

17:37.267 --> 17:38.700
with the  rug.

17:38.700 --> 17:40.967
You're not done yet.
That's just Act 1.

17:40.967 --> 17:42.367
Oh, .

17:42.367 --> 17:44.067
Geez, Joe.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.933
This is the finest palace
I've ever seen.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.667
Genie,
I wish for the princess

17:53.667 --> 17:55.467
to be here by my side
right now.

17:55.467 --> 17:57.700
Genie does as you wish.

17:57.700 --> 18:05.433
**

18:05.433 --> 18:09.067
It's the most magnificent palace
I've ever seen!

18:09.067 --> 18:11.833
He's just --
he's just swaying.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.900
Do you live in this big palace
all by yourself?
I do.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.567
Do you have a lot of people
that live with you?
Just the servants.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.167
Please,
I can't wait any longer.

18:24.367 --> 18:26.067
Grace me with your hand
in marriage.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.133
Of course I will!

18:27.133 --> 18:30.133
Genie, I wish to be marrce

18:30.133 --> 18:31.500
once and for all!

18:31.500 --> 18:32.833
Genie does as you wi--

18:34.867 --> 18:36.200
Woman: Oh! Oh, my God.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.433
Q: His pants!

18:37.433 --> 18:39.367
Murr: He's upside down!

18:39.367 --> 18:41.133
His pa--
He's upside down.

18:41.133 --> 18:43.300
Sal:
They are dumbfounded.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.733
He's holding his pants up.

18:46.733 --> 18:49.700
The string popped off
that was holding it.
We almost lost Joe.

18:49.700 --> 18:51.133
Joey,
it's not over yet, buddy.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.900
Let's just finish this.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.900
It's all down to this --
Act 3, the big conclusion.

18:55.900 --> 18:57.067
**

18:57.067 --> 18:58.367
Genie, thank you so much

18:58.367 --> 19:00.433
for making all my dreams
come true.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.967
My pleasure.
Congratulations on everything.

19:02.967 --> 19:03.967
That's not your line.

19:03.967 --> 19:05.867
Everybody is gathered.

19:05.867 --> 19:07.867
Let the ceremony begin.

19:15.533 --> 19:17.367
When I was a young boy,

19:17.367 --> 19:20.167
I never imagined meeting
someone as beautiful as you.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.400
Now all these years later,
here I am,

19:23.400 --> 19:26.300
exchanging vows.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.367
Joe: All right.

19:29.367 --> 19:31.200
I never thought
I'd fall in love...

19:34.067 --> 19:35.700
Sorry, sorry about that.

19:35.700 --> 19:36.767
Joe just punch the wall.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.700
...that led me to you.

19:44.533 --> 19:45.700
I think we're gonna have
a very nice,

19:45.700 --> 19:48.200
beautiful,
amazing life together.

19:48.200 --> 19:49.500
Joe:
Congratulations.

19:52.133 --> 19:54.233
[ Audience gasps,
laughter ]

19:59.800 --> 20:02.800
Man:
Huzzah! They are married!

20:07.433 --> 20:08.867
Well done.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.933
Well done.

20:10.933 --> 20:11.933
Very good.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.800
**

20:13.800 --> 20:17.567
**

20:17.567 --> 20:19.600
Whoa, okay, welcome
to "Impractical Insider."

20:19.600 --> 20:22.300
Joe just destroyed it
in tonight's punishment,

20:22.300 --> 20:23.833
and now you get
a behind-the-scenes look

20:23.833 --> 20:24.800
of how it went down and...

20:24.800 --> 20:26.633
Whoa!

20:26.633 --> 20:30.767
...Uh, bonus features like that
from tonight's episode.

20:30.767 --> 20:34.633
**

20:34.633 --> 20:35.867
What is this, Chase?

20:35.867 --> 20:37.733
This is the most fragile
set piece we have.

20:37.733 --> 20:40.200
This is all, um,
breakaway glass.
Ah!

20:40.200 --> 20:42.500
So this is all
made of sugar.
Ah!

20:42.500 --> 20:44.500
So this is candy glass.
Da-da --

20:44.500 --> 20:46.533
I'm not gonna touch,
I'm not gonna touch.
Don't!

20:46.533 --> 20:48.867
And Will Thaxton
made this?
Yes.

20:48.867 --> 20:52.033
Okay, so you've got foam,
you got candy glass.

20:52.033 --> 20:54.667
Will: Foam furniture
and then some, like, brass items

20:54.667 --> 20:56.967
and stuff like that,
to make noise.

20:58.567 --> 21:00.300
Yeah, the noise is important.
That's thoughtful.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.600
And some flowers, too.
Some flowers?

21:01.600 --> 21:03.400
Yeah, make it look pretty,
you know?
Yeah, yeah.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.900
All right,
let's do a run-through.

21:04.900 --> 21:10.067
**

21:10.067 --> 21:11.500
You have one line only.
Joe: Okay?

21:11.500 --> 21:13.433
All you got to say is,
"Genie does as you wish."

21:13.433 --> 21:15.133
Get ready to fly, baby.

21:16.433 --> 21:18.067
I'll take
the fried calamari!

21:18.067 --> 21:22.733
Casey: Ladies and gentlemen,
in the process of the genie.

21:22.733 --> 21:25.300
So, you just found out
what you got to do?

21:25.300 --> 21:27.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm a genie in a bottle.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.600
You got to rub me
the right way.

21:28.600 --> 21:29.933
I like to give the curves.

21:29.933 --> 21:31.667
Oh, it's gone?
Go get it.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.667
Whoa!
That is a huge difference!

21:33.667 --> 21:35.167
Does that with force.

21:35.167 --> 21:36.767
Ready?
Come on, you want some of that?

21:36.767 --> 21:38.167
There's our big purp.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.167
I mean, honestly,
I'm telling you, man,

21:40.167 --> 21:41.200
this looks good on you.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.433
It really does.

21:42.433 --> 21:44.933
It looks cool.

21:44.933 --> 21:46.667
Casey:
You're putting together, like,
a pretty good show tonight.

21:46.667 --> 21:47.833
There's, like,
lighting rigs...

21:47.833 --> 21:48.833
It's
a full-on production.

21:48.833 --> 21:50.100
Full-on production.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.633
Q: We've got to destroy
three full sets.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.900
We want Joe to be
a human wrecking ball.
That's what it is.

21:55.900 --> 21:57.367
Genie does as you wish.

21:57.367 --> 21:59.200
**

22:07.600 --> 22:08.700
This is
the guy responsible

22:08.700 --> 22:10.667
for Joe
knocking into everything.

22:10.667 --> 22:11.833
Yeah.
So you're --

22:11.833 --> 22:13.167
It's a first
for my career.

22:13.167 --> 22:14.933
They went over, like,
what you have to do.

22:14.933 --> 22:16.267
Like,
they had to block it out

22:16.267 --> 22:17.600
like you would
any other show.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.800
Yeah, for sure.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.500
But for chaos.
Yes.

22:20.500 --> 22:22.600
Joe:
Genie does as you wish.

22:25.167 --> 22:26.500
**

22:26.500 --> 22:27.900
I got caught
right in the throat

22:27.900 --> 22:30.067
with the  rug.

22:30.067 --> 22:32.067
What are you
most nervous about?

22:32.067 --> 22:33.767
That it's weird
that I'm nervous

22:33.767 --> 22:35.067
that something goes wrong

22:35.067 --> 22:37.267
in a play where everything's
supposed to go wrong.

22:37.267 --> 22:38.867
Right.

22:38.867 --> 22:39.967
I'm all tangled.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.600
It's tangled.

22:42.600 --> 22:44.533
It's -- hold on.

22:44.533 --> 22:46.733
It has to go wrong specifically,
though, right?

22:46.733 --> 22:48.233
Yeah, I'm worried
that it will go right.

22:49.767 --> 22:51.067
So, real quick, Joe --

22:51.067 --> 22:52.767
most of the time, people say,
like, "Break a leg," but

22:52.767 --> 22:54.267
I do not
want to say that.
Yes.

22:54.267 --> 22:55.667
It's not
the right thing to say.

22:55.667 --> 22:56.867
Good luck.
Yeah.

22:56.867 --> 22:59.567
Good luck, or, uh,
you know, "Break a belly."

22:59.567 --> 23:01.300
"Break a belly."
That's -- you can handle that.

23:01.300 --> 23:03.767
Joe: Congratulations.

23:05.733 --> 23:07.833
So, it's pretty crazy
right now.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.367
They're breaking down
the set.
Chris: Yep.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.200
But how is that for you?
That was great.

23:11.200 --> 23:13.633
It was very hard trying
to focus on the scene...
Yeah.

23:13.633 --> 23:15.167
when you see
Joe flying behind you

23:15.167 --> 23:17.800
dressed in purple
and smacking into walls.

23:20.467 --> 23:22.200
Joe:
All right, here we go.
Okay, ready, Sal?

23:22.200 --> 23:24.267
Q: He didn't know it's --
I'm gonna --

23:26.333 --> 23:28.200
Joe: Oh!

23:28.200 --> 23:29.633
It's over the shoulder.
And remember --
Murr, Murr!

23:29.633 --> 23:30.600
It's over the shoulder,
Murr.

23:30.600 --> 23:32.767
Oh, it's --
oh, oh, I'm sorry.

23:32.767 --> 23:34.733
You can't coast on good hair
your whole life, buddy.

23:34.733 --> 23:37.133
The name of the game
is "Over the Shoulder."

23:37.133 --> 23:38.233
I mean,
how do you play it?

23:38.233 --> 23:39.667
You grab something
out of someone's cart...

23:39.667 --> 23:41.233
Where do you throw it?
...throw it
over your shoulder.

23:41.233 --> 23:42.133
Okay, got it.
That's it.

23:42.133 --> 23:43.400
Very difficult.
