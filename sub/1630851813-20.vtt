WEBVTT

00:08.312 --> 00:11.098
Oh, Mama, that smells good.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.664
- Thank you.
- Amazing.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.500
Oh, man.

00:22.544 --> 00:25.329
I never knew how attached
I was to our own damn chickens.

00:25.373 --> 00:26.983
Okay, these are fine.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.245
Can I get some bacon?

00:28.289 --> 00:29.725
Okay, all right.
You know what, everyone?

00:29.768 --> 00:33.033
Just, um, uh, stop hovering
and sit and eat.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.078
Yes, okay.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.819
Mama's spoken.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.960
- Daddy, here you go.
- Thank you, son.

00:50.137 --> 00:54.358
please all stop staring?

00:54.402 --> 00:56.795
Just because I'm graduating
does not mean

00:56.839 --> 00:59.407
that I'm... I don't know,
that I'm somebody else.

00:59.450 --> 01:00.538
You are, though.

01:00.582 --> 01:01.713
It's true, it's just...

01:01.757 --> 01:03.019
It's hard to believe.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.412
Here comes
a "seems like yesterday."

01:04.455 --> 01:06.762
Seems like yesterday.

01:06.805 --> 01:08.242
Hey, right on cue.

01:08.285 --> 01:09.895
Well, it does seem
like yesterday, Auggie.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.941
- Ooh!
- It's true.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.030
It seems like yesterday that

01:14.074 --> 01:16.641
your mama told me
she was pregnant

01:16.685 --> 01:18.556
with you,
and seems like yesterday

01:18.600 --> 01:20.080
we brought you home
to the ranch.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.646
Uh, and then,

01:21.690 --> 01:23.996
we were chasing fireflies
around the yard.

01:24.040 --> 01:25.824
So...

01:25.868 --> 01:28.653
Where are we gonna have your
last bash as a high schooler?

01:28.697 --> 01:30.351
You don't think
we can sneak on to the ranch

01:30.394 --> 01:31.917
and do what we always planned?

01:31.961 --> 01:33.267
I mean, we could just go
to Stan's house.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.355
Right?

01:38.402 --> 01:39.708
Too soon?

01:39.751 --> 01:41.013
Not funny.

01:42.058 --> 01:45.148
It doesn't matter to me
as long as we're all together.

01:46.193 --> 01:47.498
Hey, juice?

01:47.542 --> 01:48.978
- Ah, yeah. On it.
- Oh, yeah.

01:49.021 --> 01:50.632
I'm with you.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.376
So, um...

01:57.465 --> 01:59.075
Any idea who made the safe house

01:59.119 --> 02:00.729
a little less safe
the other night?

02:00.772 --> 02:03.384
No. Uh, not yet. Um...

02:03.427 --> 02:05.603
But Miles and his family are
safe and secure.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.432
Uh, Cassie and James are on it.

02:08.476 --> 02:10.739
We did identify
the bodies left behind.

02:10.782 --> 02:13.437
Long rap sheets,
just guns for hire.

02:13.481 --> 02:15.787
You think it was Serano's people
that were out for revenge?

02:15.831 --> 02:17.789
Eh, I don't know.

02:17.833 --> 02:20.183
I don't see
how that would tie to Miles.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.532
Feels like it's a new crew.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.925
One thing's for sure,

02:22.968 --> 02:25.014
we know who cheated us
out of our ranch.

02:25.057 --> 02:28.757
If we take Dan at his word
that Denise cut the saddle.

02:28.800 --> 02:31.760
I'm the last person
that wants to believe him,

02:31.803 --> 02:32.804
but he's come a long way.
I'm not sure

02:32.848 --> 02:34.066
why he'd lie about this.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.546
Either way, hard to prove

02:35.590 --> 02:36.982
unless Denise owns up to it.

02:37.026 --> 02:38.070
Which doesn't seem like

02:38.114 --> 02:39.159
the Davidsons' strong suit,
you know?

02:42.901 --> 02:44.076
What?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.861
I think there might be
another route

02:45.904 --> 02:47.254
to get to the bottom of
what that family's been hiding.

02:47.297 --> 02:48.994
- I'm headed out.
- Okay, yeah.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.431
All right, guys.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.824
I can't stay for breakfast.
Work calls.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.044
But I will see you soon.

02:55.087 --> 02:57.002
I'm-I'm proud of you, okay?

02:59.091 --> 03:01.529
Okay. I love you.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.878
Yeah, love you, too.

03:02.921 --> 03:04.880
All right.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.316
What do you got?

03:06.360 --> 03:07.404
Victor Chavez,

03:07.448 --> 03:09.232
Nate Carmouche,

03:09.276 --> 03:11.495
Anthony Fitzpatrick,
all served.

03:11.539 --> 03:12.714
- Same unit?
- Nope.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.411
No prior connections.

03:14.455 --> 03:17.849
- Hmm.
- So, what is
a paramilitary group doing

03:17.893 --> 03:19.634
trying to silence
a Texas Ranger?

03:19.677 --> 03:22.419
I don't know, maybe Miles
or Fenton got too close.

03:22.463 --> 03:23.942
Were there any vets

03:23.986 --> 03:25.640
in the Dallas car thieves ring
you investigated?

03:25.683 --> 03:27.511
No. Not a one.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.600
But based on the show
of force the other night,

03:29.644 --> 03:31.080
none of these guys went clean.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.474
They just haven't been
caught in a while.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.867
Well, someone's
protecting them.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.217
Stan Morrison was
protecting the crews

03:37.260 --> 03:38.392
that worked for Northside.

03:38.435 --> 03:39.958
Maybe it's the same thing here.

03:40.002 --> 03:41.308
You think Fenton was

03:41.351 --> 03:43.223
their not-so-angelic
guardian angel?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.659
Maybe.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.748
Let's just keep the circle
small. All right?

03:51.274 --> 03:52.623
What's up?

03:52.667 --> 03:55.104
Uh, that last case
with Miles...

03:55.147 --> 03:59.064
he was just so paranoid
before he went dark.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.067
I couldn't help
but feel the same way,

04:02.111 --> 04:03.243
like someone was watching.

04:05.636 --> 04:08.030
I don't know. Just a feeling.

04:11.076 --> 04:12.121
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:12.164 --> 04:13.253
Bad time?

04:15.298 --> 04:16.299
What makes you say that?

04:17.344 --> 04:18.823
Thought we were meeting up
later.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.129
- Yeah, you know,
I just wanted to

04:20.172 --> 04:22.000
swing by before I headed
to Sacred Heart.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.915
So, anything on our shooters?

04:26.222 --> 04:27.615
Let's, uh...

04:27.658 --> 04:29.312
Give me a second out here.

04:29.356 --> 04:31.532
Look, I appreciate your, uh...

04:31.575 --> 04:34.012
your concern and your help,
always.

04:34.056 --> 04:35.623
But, uh,

04:35.666 --> 04:37.842
this is, you know,
official Ranger business now.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.453
Yeah, I know that.

04:39.496 --> 04:40.671
I just figured, you know,
I could at least

04:40.715 --> 04:42.325
help with the profiles.

04:42.369 --> 04:43.892
I mean, there's no doubt

04:43.935 --> 04:45.372
that those guys were military,
man, and I...

04:45.415 --> 04:46.938
Ah. I was right. I can see it.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.593
- You can see what?
- The fire that's inside you.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.726
It's like you have to
help people.

04:53.989 --> 04:56.296
All right, look,
what are you trying to say, Cap?

04:56.339 --> 04:58.776
Look, I'm gonna...

04:58.820 --> 05:00.169
I'm gonna be straight with you.

05:00.212 --> 05:03.694
I may have made
a phone call or two

05:03.738 --> 05:05.130
to the governor's office.

05:05.174 --> 05:07.089
About me?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.787
Had a little chat
with DPS, too.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.572
And they are willing

05:11.615 --> 05:14.444
to treat
your military experience

05:14.488 --> 05:16.185
as time served as a Trooper,

05:16.228 --> 05:20.842
if this is something
that you want.

05:21.886 --> 05:24.628
So, we're not talking about
a psych consult gig here?

05:24.672 --> 05:25.977
No, we are not.

05:26.021 --> 05:28.284
Cap, you want me to be a Ranger?

05:28.328 --> 05:29.503
I do.

05:29.546 --> 05:31.200
Only if you want it.

05:31.243 --> 05:32.723
And listen, if you want it...

05:34.029 --> 05:35.378
...I mean, you got to be all in.

05:35.422 --> 05:38.338
Yeah. I-I-I need to think
about this one.

05:38.381 --> 05:40.775
You do that,
we'll talk when you're ready.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.386
Yeah.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.779
- Thank you.
- All right, I'll see you.

05:52.656 --> 05:55.137
"I always knew we'd be
together again."

05:56.443 --> 05:59.010
There's no chance Gale didn't
mean something more by that.

05:59.054 --> 06:00.795
No, not after
we talked to Nate.

06:00.838 --> 06:02.536
- No.
- I mean, you heard him,

06:02.579 --> 06:05.843
how careful he was
about protecting Frank, me.

06:05.887 --> 06:07.715
Yeah.

06:07.758 --> 06:09.847
Gale is the only person

06:09.891 --> 06:11.371
that Marv could've told
that I was out there.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.329
I always knew
we'd be together again.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.678
How?

06:14.722 --> 06:18.029
Well, just-just in this life,
or-or the next.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.727
<i>We both know</i>
<i>she's hiding something.</i>

06:19.770 --> 06:21.468
And then
Denise cutting the saddle.

06:21.511 --> 06:25.863
Okay, uh, Geri,

06:25.907 --> 06:27.909
first of all, I-I'm so sorry

06:27.952 --> 06:30.477
about everything,
but I've tried

06:30.520 --> 06:33.697
to get Denise to talk,
Liam has tried.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.569
Uh, we-we even tried
with-with Dan.

06:35.612 --> 06:37.440
We tried with the whole family
at the din...Okay, Cordi,

06:37.484 --> 06:40.530
we can't give up.
We both know that...

06:40.574 --> 06:42.053
They're not going to talk

06:42.097 --> 06:45.274
to me, to a Walker.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.841
But...

06:46.884 --> 06:50.714
you, um...
you're a-a Davidson.

06:52.803 --> 06:53.848
You're family.

07:06.034 --> 07:08.297
Good afternoon,
Sacred Heart seniors.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.909
Since this is just a rehearsal,
in lieu of diplomas,

07:11.953 --> 07:15.043
I'll be handing out
your last report cards.

07:15.086 --> 07:18.350
Now, for some of you,
this won't be good news.

07:18.394 --> 07:20.048
So, please,

07:20.091 --> 07:22.398
hold your applause
until the end.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.532
Mary Patricia Yost.

07:32.147 --> 07:33.714
Hey, don't get in your head, T.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.499
You did it. You're graduating.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.632
Yeah, we did it.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.155
I can't believe it's over.

07:40.198 --> 07:42.287
Yeah, but you're
going to college,

07:42.331 --> 07:44.072
and you're probably
gonna have to tutor Todd

07:44.115 --> 07:45.900
at Sauber next year,
just like this year.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.468
Oh, you're getting
jealous again, Colton?

07:48.511 --> 07:50.600
No, never was,
- never will be.
- Okay, yeah.

07:57.694 --> 07:59.609
Thank you.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.568
What do you think is next?

08:02.612 --> 08:03.657
What do you...

08:03.700 --> 08:05.354
For Stella. I mean...

08:05.397 --> 08:06.747
I mean, come on,

08:06.790 --> 08:08.531
you probably
remember graduating

08:08.575 --> 08:10.925
and wondering what
happens next, huh?

08:10.968 --> 08:12.753
Yeah.

08:12.796 --> 08:14.842
Your sister knows who she is.
That's the important thing.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.454
You, on the other hand...

08:18.498 --> 08:19.934
Stella Blue Walker.

08:24.199 --> 08:25.330
You think you're gonna be
all right next year,

08:25.374 --> 08:26.549
without your big sister here?

08:26.593 --> 08:28.290
I'll be fine.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.334
I mean, come on,
I have you around

08:29.378 --> 08:30.466
to keep me in line, right?

08:31.511 --> 08:32.599
Yeah.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.558
Thank you.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.517
Yeah, Stella!

08:41.477 --> 08:43.348
Get out of here.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.962
So, how does it feel,
having a granddaughter

08:48.005 --> 08:50.399
you helped raise
about to fly away?

08:50.442 --> 08:54.446
Uh, well, I've had
the same feeling about,

08:54.490 --> 08:56.710
I don't know, 15 years ago?

08:56.753 --> 08:58.276
Yeah, and look what happened.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.757
Honey, so what's next for you?

09:00.801 --> 09:02.933
- Hmm?
- You know, you can
still practice law.

09:04.892 --> 09:09.897
I don't know what
I want to do anymore.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.768
This is a real upbeat bunch.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.423
You know, I envy you.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.077
Now I think I'm hearing things.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.948
No, I'm serious.

09:17.992 --> 09:20.472
You working this land,
I mean, you knew who you were.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.300
Your whole life. You
were even humble enough

09:22.344 --> 09:24.172
to help Dan with the ranch.

09:24.215 --> 09:27.523
You know, you put aside
everything to get the job done.

09:27.567 --> 09:31.658
Because you have purpose.

09:32.702 --> 09:34.574
Well, it don't matter now,

09:34.617 --> 09:37.794
because we got no ranch to work
and no land to call our own.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.667
Yep.

09:40.710 --> 09:41.842
Real upbeat bunch.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.849
I cannot believe
I thought it was a good idea

09:48.892 --> 09:50.459
to date you in the first place.

09:50.502 --> 09:52.374
Oh, really? Well,
you thought it was a good idea

09:52.417 --> 09:54.115
to-to drag me into your bedroom

09:54.158 --> 09:55.856
when I just came
over to talk.

09:55.899 --> 09:58.249
- Wow, "drag you"?
Yes.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.121
Oh, great, so I'm getting
bedroom etiquette tips

10:00.164 --> 10:03.124
from the Ranger who sleeps
with his informants?

10:03.167 --> 10:05.082
See-- O-Okay, I-I did not...

10:05.126 --> 10:06.431
You didn't?

10:06.475 --> 10:08.042
- Oh! Wow, look at that.
- Interesting.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.478
Hi, there, Gale.
Look who's here.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.827
I can see why you
called me for the ride.

10:10.871 --> 10:12.742
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

10:12.786 --> 10:14.091
Yeah, well-- h-hold on.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.353
Hold on.
I gotta say,

10:15.397 --> 10:16.616
once you realized
y-you were, uh,

10:16.659 --> 10:19.183
one of them,
you became a different person.

10:19.227 --> 10:21.098
- You mean, who I'm
supposed to be?

10:21.142 --> 10:23.971
It's more like my
eyes are open, Cordi.

10:24.014 --> 10:25.755
You know what? Hey, Geri,
I got to go pick up Denise, too.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.366
- Yeah.
- Oh, Denise, too?

10:28.410 --> 10:30.673
All the Davidson girls
together.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.676
- You know what?
- Hey, Geri, uh, make
sure you-you thank your sister

10:33.720 --> 10:35.678
for cutting my saddle for you.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.985
- Okay, you need to drop that.
- Cut the saddle?

10:38.028 --> 10:39.726
You know what?
You and your family,

10:39.769 --> 10:42.380
you just, you can't
accept what happened.

10:42.424 --> 10:44.165
You never could.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.036
Why don't you just go ahead
and leave already?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.996
I am. And don't expect me to
come back, because I quit.

10:49.039 --> 10:50.780
Go ahead and quit.
A-And don't come back.

10:50.824 --> 10:52.695
Frankly, the only reason we kept
you around was out of pity,

10:52.739 --> 10:53.653
- anyway.
- Oh.

10:53.696 --> 10:54.697
So carry on.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.656
Screw you.

10:56.699 --> 10:57.831
Okay. Come on. Walk away.

10:59.397 --> 11:00.660
You don't owe him

11:00.703 --> 11:03.010
or his family a damn thing.

11:03.053 --> 11:04.794
Let's go home.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.982
I can't believe I trusted him,

11:19.026 --> 11:20.549
let him in on anything.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.682
All they ever do
is point fingers.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.948
Well, speaking of falling
in love with the wrong person.

11:27.991 --> 11:30.820
Didn't dad propose
to Abby Walker right before you?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.868
Wow.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.957
Hey, Denise, can I talk
to you for a second?

11:37.000 --> 11:39.568
- Do I have a choice?
- Oh, a choice?

11:39.611 --> 11:40.917
Like I have a choice to go

11:40.961 --> 11:42.353
to our son's graduation
despite your feelings?

11:42.397 --> 11:43.746
- That type of choice?
- Oh, right,

11:43.790 --> 11:45.313
because after everything
you've accused me of,

11:45.356 --> 11:47.576
I'm supposed to just
sit next to you and smile.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.318
Hey, um, can I ask,

11:50.361 --> 11:52.059
why didn't you remarry?

11:53.277 --> 11:55.715
You don't think all the tragedy

11:55.758 --> 11:58.239
and misery and heartbreak
was enough to make me pause?

11:58.282 --> 12:00.850
I'm sure you felt
the same way after Hoyt.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.505
You know? But you deserve it.

12:03.548 --> 12:06.813
Someone worthy of your love.

12:06.856 --> 12:08.118
Mom.

12:09.903 --> 12:12.035
I can't stop thinking about it.

12:12.079 --> 12:14.298
I really want
to know more

12:14.342 --> 12:15.822
about my father.

12:17.737 --> 12:18.999
All right.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.436
- Come on.
- Okay.

12:21.479 --> 12:24.091
What? Movers?

12:24.134 --> 12:26.571
Ma, it's, like,
ten minutes away.

12:26.615 --> 12:27.834
You taught me better than that.

12:27.877 --> 12:29.139
Well, how are the neighbors?

12:29.183 --> 12:30.314
Loud.

12:31.925 --> 12:33.883
Uh, I haven't met any yet.

12:33.927 --> 12:35.450
What's up, honey?

12:35.493 --> 12:37.495
You okay?

12:39.062 --> 12:43.632
Captain James, he-he made me
an offer to be a Texas Ranger.

12:44.676 --> 12:46.330
Full-time.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.376
Ma?

12:49.420 --> 12:51.683
Ma?

12:51.727 --> 12:53.511
Processing.

12:53.555 --> 12:56.079
Trey, when you told me that
you were leaving the military,

12:56.123 --> 12:58.734
it felt like there was a God.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.344
Hey, I haven't said yes, Ma.

13:00.388 --> 13:02.869
All of that stress, anxiety.

13:02.912 --> 13:05.915
I know. I know, but...

13:05.959 --> 13:08.048
You know I've been
searching, and...

13:08.091 --> 13:10.006
I don't know, I just feel
like this is me, you know?

13:10.050 --> 13:12.095
I can't stand in the way

13:12.139 --> 13:14.619
of what your heart's
telling you to do, son.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.187
Just don't expect me
to like it right away.

13:18.145 --> 13:20.625
Hey.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.063
Uh, Ma, look,

13:23.106 --> 13:24.325
I-I'll call you back, all right?

13:24.368 --> 13:26.544
I'll talk to you
later. Love you.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.155
- Cass.
- Hey.

13:28.198 --> 13:31.985
You live here, directly
across the hall from me?

13:32.028 --> 13:34.161
Well, there were only two
apartments left in the building,

13:34.204 --> 13:35.727
so don't overthink it.

13:35.771 --> 13:36.772
Mm.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.382
But, uh...

13:38.426 --> 13:41.081
have you given the other thing
some more thought?

13:42.299 --> 13:43.474
Huh.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.215
On the fence.

13:45.259 --> 13:46.608
Yeah.

13:46.651 --> 13:48.436
I respect that.
It's a big decision.

13:48.479 --> 13:49.959
Yeah.

13:50.003 --> 13:52.092
So, since talking about
the case is off-limits,

13:52.135 --> 13:54.834
how about you tell me
why you're all dressed up?

13:54.877 --> 13:56.792
Date.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.706
You know,

13:57.749 --> 13:59.099
swipe left, swipe right.

13:59.142 --> 14:00.404
Whatever.

14:00.448 --> 14:02.711
It's my first date in
eight months. Since...

14:02.754 --> 14:04.844
well, since becoming a Ranger.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.889
But I don't put that I'm
a Ranger on my profile,

14:06.933 --> 14:08.238
because I don't want
people to hunt down

14:08.282 --> 14:09.544
my hall mates and kill them.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.067
Thank you.

14:11.111 --> 14:12.329
Yeah, you're welcome.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.635
I guess I'll, uh,

14:13.678 --> 14:14.854
I'll see you
around the building.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.377
Yeah.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.292
Hey, hey, by any chance,
can you...

14:19.902 --> 14:22.862
Can-- Just...
turn it down a little bit?

14:23.906 --> 14:26.213
There you go-- Ooh.

14:32.175 --> 14:35.918
Geri, I can't help but think
you got more on your mind

14:35.962 --> 14:38.094
than just asking about your dad.

14:38.138 --> 14:41.924
You know, I think it's just
what you said the other night,

14:41.968 --> 14:43.795
about knowing

14:43.839 --> 14:45.232
that we'd see each other again.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.757
Why did you know that?

14:52.282 --> 14:55.416
You know, I always wanted
to have a lot of kids.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.984
And then, when
you were born,

14:58.027 --> 15:00.290
Marv told me
you didn't make it. Um...

15:00.334 --> 15:02.640
I never got to see you after.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.425
Because he wouldn't let me.

15:04.468 --> 15:07.341
I should have known, 'cause
I could feel it in my bones

15:07.384 --> 15:09.386
that you were out there, so...

15:09.430 --> 15:10.910
I mean, you want to know why

15:10.953 --> 15:12.085
I don't want to talk
about your father?

15:12.128 --> 15:13.303
It's 'cause he lied to me.

15:13.347 --> 15:15.131
I guess I'm trying
to understand,

15:15.175 --> 15:17.960
you hate the Walkers,
you blame them.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.396
But if it was my father
who lied...

15:19.440 --> 15:21.311
Okay, wait a minute.

15:21.355 --> 15:24.793
Abeline Walker knew
you were out there.

15:24.836 --> 15:27.448
Cordell started the fire,
Liam tried

15:27.491 --> 15:29.189
to frame Dan, and
all of a sudden,

15:29.232 --> 15:31.974
- you're taking their side of it?
- No, it's not about sides.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.280
It's about knowing what happened

15:33.323 --> 15:34.629
when you found out
that I was alive.

15:34.672 --> 15:35.978
They stole you from me, okay?

15:36.022 --> 15:37.937
And all of a sudden--
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.503
You don't have...Excuse me.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.560
Geri. Hey. Uh, what you got?

15:52.603 --> 15:54.779
She's still hiding something.

15:54.823 --> 15:56.172
Has she said anything new?

15:56.216 --> 15:57.173
Anything we didn't already know?

15:57.217 --> 15:58.870
It's the same old story,

15:58.914 --> 16:00.916
but I see it in grief group
all the time.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.658
It's a coping mechanism
for something deeper.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.225
Something she's guilty of.

16:06.356 --> 16:09.316
You know what?
Take her to the barn.

16:09.359 --> 16:11.622
- What?
- Stan Morrison,
I took him back to the desert,

16:11.666 --> 16:14.930
where Emily-- where, um,
where it-it happened.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.325
Uh, and being there,
he couldn't hide anymore.

16:18.368 --> 16:22.068
So, Gale, if she feels any
remorse, any guilt whatsoever,

16:22.111 --> 16:24.679
it'll be there, at the barn.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.338
I'm sorry.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.209
- No.
- I-I shouldn't have rushed off.

16:33.253 --> 16:35.864
You... you have
the right to ask.

16:35.907 --> 16:39.476
Look, I-I understand.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.870
I know that it's hard
to relive these moments.

16:41.913 --> 16:43.393
The past.

16:44.394 --> 16:48.007
But for me, for my journey...

16:49.356 --> 16:51.662
...I need to see
where my father died.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.802
You know, when I was little,

17:00.845 --> 17:02.978
when I first came to Austin,

17:03.022 --> 17:06.416
Walker Ranch was, like,
this playground.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.549
But we never came over here.

17:08.592 --> 17:12.248
And that was long
after y'all had left.

17:12.292 --> 17:14.337
When we were driven out.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.733
Why don't we go inside?

17:33.139 --> 17:34.836
- God, that's, like, perfect.
- Thank you.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.751
He's-he's done that.
It's really good.

17:36.794 --> 17:39.710
Okay, so, about the
- nut allergy guy. Thanks.
- Mm.

17:39.754 --> 17:43.062
Oh, right.
Okay, so after my grandmother

17:43.105 --> 17:45.194
stabbed him with an EpiPen,

17:45.238 --> 17:48.545
he recovered, unfortunately,
and then he suggested

17:48.589 --> 17:51.244
that we all go around the table
to talk about our fathers.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.898
- Ugh, no.
- Oh, yes.

17:53.942 --> 17:57.380
And so, I, uh, I took
a handful of almonds

17:57.424 --> 17:58.816
and stuffed them in my mouth,

17:58.860 --> 18:00.035
- you know, just in case.
- Wow.

18:00.079 --> 18:00.601
Okay.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.471
Yeah. Your turn.

18:01.515 --> 18:04.083
Oof, okay.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.737
Uh, let's see.
Bad date, bad date.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.522
Yikes, that many?

18:08.565 --> 18:10.176
No. No.

18:10.219 --> 18:13.004
Could be, just, I'm enjoying
being on a good one.

18:13.048 --> 18:15.355
You know?

18:15.398 --> 18:18.009
So... how much
do you hate your job?

18:18.053 --> 18:19.359
What?

18:19.402 --> 18:21.361
I never said I hate my job.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.928
Well, you didn't say
anything at all.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.974
Usually, people talk about
what they do right away.

18:26.017 --> 18:28.237
- You know? Break the ice.
- Well, Sean,

18:28.281 --> 18:30.805
my whole thing is that I'm
disarming and different.

18:30.848 --> 18:34.069
I know. You must be
a cop or something.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.203
Working a real grisly case.

18:37.246 --> 18:39.640
Just needed a night off. Right?

18:41.816 --> 18:44.471
Well, you know what, you never
mentioned your job, either.

18:45.994 --> 18:48.649
So, what,
do you hate your job, too,

18:48.692 --> 18:50.781
or are you a contract killer?

18:52.740 --> 18:55.699
Uh, I'd tell you,
but I'd have to...

18:55.743 --> 18:58.224
Ah, yeah. Sure, sure.

18:58.267 --> 19:00.617
No, I...

19:00.661 --> 19:02.924
I, uh, sell sheet metal.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.405
- Oh.
- Yeah. What's say

19:05.448 --> 19:07.668
I tell you all about it
when I get back from the john?

19:07.711 --> 19:09.322
- Deal.
- All right.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.453
Be right back.

19:29.907 --> 19:31.474
Hey.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.259
Did he stiff you with the tab?

19:33.302 --> 19:34.434
- What?
- Your date.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.741
He just went out the back door.

19:37.785 --> 19:40.222
I'm sorry. Round's on me.

19:41.223 --> 19:43.573
Yeah. Thanks.

19:46.446 --> 19:49.797
You know, last year, um,

19:49.840 --> 19:52.756
after Hoyt, I left town
for a little bit.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.107
Being around the Walkers
was so hard.

19:56.151 --> 19:58.675
- Hmm.
- They just reminded me

19:58.719 --> 20:00.242
of everything that I'd lost.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.244
Then why'd you come back?

20:02.288 --> 20:05.291
My dad-- um, Frank...

20:05.334 --> 20:08.294
Mm-hmm....he, he used
to read me this book.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.817
It's about a bear hunt.

20:09.860 --> 20:13.124
And there were
all of these obstacles,

20:13.168 --> 20:15.344
you know, but the family
couldn't go over it

20:15.388 --> 20:17.825
or under it.

20:17.868 --> 20:20.567
They had to go through it.

20:20.610 --> 20:23.091
So I came back.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.273
I was so...

20:31.317 --> 20:34.276
angry at Hoyt.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.887
I couldn't figure out
why at first.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.368
For dying?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.240
For loving me and leaving me?

20:43.154 --> 20:45.853
For being such a damn idiot
in the first place?

20:45.896 --> 20:50.161
I don't know,
it was all of it, I guess.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.034
Which started...

20:53.077 --> 20:55.210
it started to make it okay.

20:56.951 --> 21:00.911
Well, I was angry
with Marv, too.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.087
For how long, I couldn't,
I couldn't say, but...

21:04.045 --> 21:05.220
Oh, we fought.

21:05.264 --> 21:10.617
About money, the ranch, Abby.

21:10.660 --> 21:14.273
And he talked to Abby
about all of it.

21:14.316 --> 21:16.144
But to go behind your back?

21:16.187 --> 21:19.103
Tell her the truth
about your baby?

21:20.104 --> 21:21.454
That's...

21:22.498 --> 21:24.108
That wasn't her secret to tell.

21:25.066 --> 21:26.502
Ah, that's funny.

21:26.546 --> 21:28.156
She said the same thing to me.

21:29.375 --> 21:30.811
You know, she
never knew...

21:33.683 --> 21:35.163
...if he told you.

21:38.514 --> 21:39.776
Of course he did.

21:41.604 --> 21:43.432
Abby told him to tell me,
didn't she?

21:44.955 --> 21:46.783
When you found out,

21:46.827 --> 21:48.350
what-what did you do?

21:48.394 --> 21:50.047
Just give it
a rest already.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.484
- I will not.
- What is your deal
with Abby, huh?

21:51.527 --> 21:53.094
What is my deal?
Why don't you tell me?

21:53.137 --> 21:55.401
You were there
for hours, Marv. Hours!

21:55.444 --> 21:57.664
He said he had
something to tell me,

21:57.707 --> 22:00.841
and, uh, when he said it,
it was like

22:00.884 --> 22:02.799
when someone just pulls you
right out of your body.

22:02.843 --> 22:03.931
Help me find the kids.

22:03.974 --> 22:06.020
<i> And then he remembered Denise.</i>

22:06.063 --> 22:08.762
- What about her?
- The, uh, the-the comet.

22:08.805 --> 22:11.373
He knew she and Cordell
wanted to watch it together,

22:11.417 --> 22:13.201
and we thought they should
keep their distance.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.985
But, like, of all times, this
is what he's thinking about.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.074
So, so you...

22:17.118 --> 22:19.686
<i>you came into the barn and they</i>
<i>were-- and they were there?</i>

22:19.729 --> 22:21.775
Well-well, they-they
must have heard us arguing

22:21.818 --> 22:23.994
and, um, probably
snuck out the back.

22:24.038 --> 22:25.300
Denise? Where are you?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.519
He was so worried,
you know?

22:26.562 --> 22:27.563
Like he was father
of the-the damn year.

22:27.607 --> 22:28.651
<i>Do you wanna tell me...</i>

22:28.695 --> 22:30.610
<i>Fine. Calm down.</i>

22:30.653 --> 22:33.221
Don't tell me to calm down.
- Yes, I want to know the truth.
- Fine.

22:33.264 --> 22:35.441
So when he told you...What, when
he remembered

22:35.484 --> 22:36.877
<i>to tell me you were still alive?</i> She's alive.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.750
It was like an afterthought.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.186
It was like,
"Oh, by the way."

22:44.928 --> 22:46.582
I remember, I was just
staring at him,

22:46.626 --> 22:48.541
and I was just wondering...

22:48.584 --> 22:50.020
- I couldn't take care of her--
we couldn't take care...

22:50.064 --> 22:52.545
...I mean, how that couldn't
mean everything.

22:53.850 --> 22:56.070
That's because he didn't
tell you everything, did he?

22:56.113 --> 22:58.899
Not just that
I was alive.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.640
But that he had known.

23:00.683 --> 23:02.032
He knew the whole time.

23:02.076 --> 23:04.165
- 12 years.
- He was just
looking at me,

23:04.208 --> 23:06.385
he was...

23:06.428 --> 23:07.995
he was standing right there,
and he said

23:08.038 --> 23:09.126
to my face,

23:09.170 --> 23:10.824
<i>"but she's had a good life."</i>

23:10.867 --> 23:13.609
Gale, let it go.

23:16.743 --> 23:19.398
And he was, like, proud.
Like he fixed things for us.

23:24.011 --> 23:25.708
And something
inside me just snapped.

23:27.057 --> 23:28.798
Cordell? Denise?

23:28.842 --> 23:30.017
Where are you?

23:30.060 --> 23:31.148
Cordell?

23:32.367 --> 23:33.629
<i>Answer me.</i>

23:34.587 --> 23:35.631
Cordell!

23:36.806 --> 23:39.069
And so I hit him.

23:39.113 --> 23:40.288
Denise?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.208
So, y-you hit him, and then wh--

23:47.251 --> 23:48.644
and then, what,
and then, you just...

23:48.688 --> 23:49.950
- did you just walk away?
- Okay, look-look,

23:49.993 --> 23:51.865
you don't understand
how angry I was.

23:51.908 --> 23:54.215
I mean, that-that
he took that choice,

23:54.258 --> 23:56.217
<i>from me, from you.</i>

23:56.260 --> 23:58.306
Why didn't you
tell someone?

23:58.349 --> 24:00.439
D-Did you ask Frank?

24:00.482 --> 24:02.658
<i>I didn't, I didn't know</i>
<i>about Frank.</i>

24:02.702 --> 24:04.007
<i>I didn't know</i>

24:04.051 --> 24:05.269
about Frank.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.011
Geri, how-how would that look?

24:09.883 --> 24:11.058
<i>There was my husband, dead.</i>

24:11.101 --> 24:12.799
And-and Abby just

24:12.842 --> 24:14.844
pushed him to tell me.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.242
You lied about Cordi.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.592
He brought the lantern.

24:23.636 --> 24:25.768
And-and I blamed
him for that.

24:25.812 --> 24:28.118
<i>But everything just got</i>
<i>just muddled in my head.</i>

24:28.162 --> 24:29.511
<i>All those years,</i>
<i>I kept telling myself,</i>

24:29.555 --> 24:31.818
trying to pull myself out of it.

24:31.861 --> 24:33.820
But I don't know,
I guess had to go through it.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.604
I don't...No. No! No, no, no. Stop!

24:41.958 --> 24:44.874
Gale! Gale!

24:51.141 --> 24:53.492
Come on, Geri.

25:07.027 --> 25:08.332
Geri.

25:21.563 --> 25:22.521
Cordi!

25:22.564 --> 25:23.870
Geri! Geri.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.003
- Geri.
- I'm okay, I'm okay, I'm okay!

25:27.047 --> 25:29.615
Gale! She's inside.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.007
- What?
- She's inside,
I couldn't get her.

25:31.051 --> 25:33.793
Back up. Back up.
Stay back, stay back.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.481
Oh, my God.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.702
Gale.

26:13.746 --> 26:16.270
Okay. Okay.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.532
Oh, my God.

26:18.620 --> 26:19.795
- Gale.
- Gale.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.058
- Gale?

26:25.845 --> 26:27.411
Hey. It's okay.

26:27.455 --> 26:28.674
It's okay.

26:40.686 --> 26:43.558
Hey. It's all right.
Help is coming.

26:55.396 --> 26:56.876
You all right?

26:56.919 --> 26:59.835
Yeah. You know, this
whole time, I-I thought,

26:59.879 --> 27:01.837
I thought I did this,
thought it was my fault.

27:01.881 --> 27:05.580
My memory made me think that,
that I caused Marv to come in

27:05.624 --> 27:10.280
and-and save my life,
to-to save Denise and me.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.282
Uh, but I wasn't even there.

27:12.326 --> 27:14.067
I-I wasn't even,
I wasn't even here.

27:14.110 --> 27:16.939
How could she take you
guys to court like that?

27:16.983 --> 27:18.637
Augie...Like, why'd she think

27:18.680 --> 27:19.986
she'd ever get away with it?

27:20.029 --> 27:21.378
'Cause we didn't
know the truth.

27:21.422 --> 27:23.380
We only knew what we tried
to do that night.

27:23.424 --> 27:26.645
What we failed to do.
And Cordell was just a kid.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.124
Uh, yeah.

27:28.168 --> 27:30.561
And it hung over you
your whole life.

27:32.128 --> 27:34.043
Well, it's over.

27:34.087 --> 27:36.350
Maybe it's finally over.

27:36.393 --> 27:38.744
It's over. Yeah.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.442
Be right back.

27:41.485 --> 27:43.662
All right? Augie?

27:51.974 --> 27:53.846
Hi.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.851
You don't have to worry.
I will confess everything.

27:58.894 --> 28:01.767
It just feels
so insignificant

28:01.810 --> 28:03.899
to say I'm sorry.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.077
Thank you for getting me
out of there.

28:08.121 --> 28:10.601
You didn't have to do that.

28:10.645 --> 28:12.516
No, I did.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.650
It's the only way
we, uh, we move forward.

28:17.391 --> 28:18.827
Through it.

28:21.003 --> 28:24.528
- Um, no cuffs.
- Yes, sir.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.406
Denise.

28:32.449 --> 28:34.016
Cordi.

28:34.060 --> 28:35.583
I should have known.

28:35.626 --> 28:38.934
I should have known
it was never your fault.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.763
Yeah, well...

28:41.807 --> 28:44.810
I think we both just started
believing our own nightmares.

28:44.853 --> 28:45.854
Yeah.

28:45.898 --> 28:47.682
You lost your father.

28:47.726 --> 28:51.642
You all lost a lot.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.786
You didn't actually say it.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.396
That you were sorry.

29:08.268 --> 29:12.185
You know, when we, uh,
when we came back here, I...

29:12.228 --> 29:14.927
I saw a chance to get back
everything that we lost.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.669
And we did, pretty much.

29:18.713 --> 29:20.541
But I was awful.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.152
And prideful.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.069
I think I just had to go
so far over that way

29:27.113 --> 29:31.291
because sitting in the truth,
it was, it was too much.

29:31.334 --> 29:34.033
When Marv told me,

29:34.076 --> 29:38.733
no matter what I thought of you,
I was furious <i>for</i> you.

29:38.777 --> 29:40.604
I didn't know
if you knew.

29:40.648 --> 29:41.823
I didn't know

29:41.867 --> 29:44.870
if I should tell you myself.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.610
And then the trial.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.832
And how Cordell fell apart.

29:50.876 --> 29:52.791
What we do for children.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.796
I never hated you.

30:00.537 --> 30:02.888
I just hated that I wasn't you.

30:05.368 --> 30:07.022
Anyway, I'm-I'm ready.

30:13.681 --> 30:14.987
And I am.

30:16.945 --> 30:18.642
I'm so sorry.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.963
We can leave if you want.
We don't have to watch this.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.878
Oh, it's okay.

30:36.922 --> 30:39.750
It feels like
we should see it, you know?

30:39.794 --> 30:41.709
The end?

30:42.710 --> 30:45.539
But Stella, not for us, right?

30:49.064 --> 30:51.066
There's no way.

30:51.110 --> 30:54.504
We've known since day one,
we aren't defined by them.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.942
Except in the ways
that we totally are.

31:19.529 --> 31:22.097
I feel like I'm waking up
from a long nightmare.

31:22.141 --> 31:25.971
My opinions, my grudges,
the kind of marriage

31:26.014 --> 31:28.843
that I modeled us after, I-I...

31:28.887 --> 31:30.932
I don't even know
what's real anymore.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.326
Just-just give
yourself a moment.

31:34.849 --> 31:36.677
Hey.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.722
Go.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.943
Okay.

31:47.993 --> 31:49.211
Honey, I'm so sorry.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.786
I did it.

31:58.829 --> 32:00.483
I cut the saddle that day.

32:02.007 --> 32:04.357
After everything that
happened today, I can't let

32:04.400 --> 32:05.924
all of this stuff
between our families

32:05.967 --> 32:07.360
keep hanging
over your head anymore.

32:07.403 --> 32:08.665
I-I just don't get it, Mom.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.145
Why would you do
something like that?

32:10.189 --> 32:11.581
I was so angry.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.366
At-at what?

32:13.409 --> 32:15.063
I...It's o-- It's okay.

32:15.107 --> 32:16.978
- I can walk him through it.
- No.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.763
You have put up with more than I
have ever given you credit for.

32:19.807 --> 32:23.767
Uh, Colton,
that lantern.

32:23.811 --> 32:27.380
I needed the Walkers to
be robbed of something,

32:27.423 --> 32:29.512
the same way that we were
with Daddy, and...

32:31.384 --> 32:32.559
If you hate me,

32:32.602 --> 32:34.213
then I understand.

32:34.256 --> 32:36.215
But I just...No, Mom.

32:36.258 --> 32:39.783
I... I don't want
to do that anymore.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.961
Okay?

32:48.662 --> 32:50.664
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

32:51.665 --> 32:53.362
Excellent work.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.016
Gonna catch up with
your boss later.

32:55.060 --> 32:58.019
Okay? Think I'm gonna be
here for a while, though.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.194
- All right.
- So we'll talk.
Okay.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.631
- Cap.
- Hey.

33:01.675 --> 33:03.198
Not really sure where to
start catching you up, but...

33:03.242 --> 33:04.417
Walker okay?

33:04.460 --> 33:05.853
Walker's-- Walker's okay, yeah.

33:05.896 --> 33:07.028
Okay, good.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.421
I had a bad feeling.

33:10.423 --> 33:12.512
I still have a bad feeling. Now.

33:12.555 --> 33:15.210
My date last night was a recon.

33:15.254 --> 33:17.821
- What?
- Yeah. Something else is coming.

33:19.345 --> 33:21.390
You know what you've all done
by bringing me in, right?

33:23.175 --> 33:27.048
So whatever it is,
you know I'll go down fighting.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.448
Ger.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.065
Hey.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.026
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:48.069 --> 33:51.507
Seems like there should be
some kind of feeling of relief.

33:51.551 --> 33:52.813
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:52.856 --> 33:54.032
But there's not.

33:54.075 --> 33:55.294
- Nope.

33:55.337 --> 33:58.906
Cordi, it was too soon.

33:58.949 --> 34:02.127
Uh, too soon
for-for... For what?

34:02.170 --> 34:03.345
For us?

34:03.389 --> 34:05.521
For us, for-for you, for me.

34:05.565 --> 34:07.828
Both of us, to be two
separate people

34:07.871 --> 34:10.309
ready to be with each other.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.093
You know what I mean?

34:12.137 --> 34:14.661
We just skipped
too many steps.

34:14.704 --> 34:18.969
I mean, I don't know, we thought
we deserved it somehow.

34:19.013 --> 34:21.276
Mm.

34:24.627 --> 34:28.414
Stella Blue is graduating.

34:34.637 --> 34:35.943
Yeah.

34:35.986 --> 34:38.293
Just focus on that, okay?

34:38.337 --> 34:39.990
Yeah, of course.

35:09.194 --> 35:12.284
I can't believe
I'm saying this, but...

35:12.327 --> 35:15.852
somehow, this just
doesn't feel quite right.

35:15.896 --> 35:19.639
You know, we'll
make it home again.

35:19.682 --> 35:22.163
Maybe even better.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.686
And after all,
we still got a whole lot

35:23.730 --> 35:25.384
to celebrate, don't we?

35:25.427 --> 35:28.735
With you? Always.

35:33.392 --> 35:36.395
- All right. I am all set.
- Mm-hmm.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.484
Go.

35:38.527 --> 35:39.833
It's your turn.

35:39.876 --> 35:41.269
- It's my turn?
- Yeah.

35:41.313 --> 35:42.879
Okay. I...

35:42.923 --> 35:44.577
I don't understand this game.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.013
I have never understood
this game.

35:46.056 --> 35:47.623
You know that. I mean, the...

35:47.667 --> 35:50.365
I haven't even
played it since, uh...

35:50.409 --> 35:52.280
since, uh,

35:52.324 --> 35:54.630
since, you know, that...

35:54.674 --> 35:58.504
that night-- uh, the night,
the night your mom called.

35:58.547 --> 36:02.203
- Uh... You?
- No.

36:02.247 --> 36:07.252
It seems like a good time
for us all to start things over.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.863
Or carry on where we left off.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.258
You know, uh,

36:13.301 --> 36:16.957
time was, I-I never
would have taken this game

36:17.000 --> 36:20.134
out of the box again, I'd have
never looked at it, uh...

36:20.178 --> 36:22.963
And it is so like you...

36:23.006 --> 36:25.052
Mm.

36:25.095 --> 36:27.489
Like your mom,

36:27.533 --> 36:30.100
to make me face it again.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.755
I didn't mean
to make you feel bad.

36:32.799 --> 36:35.193
No. No, no, no.
And I don't mean that at all.

36:35.236 --> 36:37.847
I mean, I mean that in the,
in the best possible way.

36:37.891 --> 36:40.198
Stella, you make me...

36:40.241 --> 36:42.591
feel.

36:42.635 --> 36:45.507
You make all of us feel.

36:45.551 --> 36:48.771
It's you.
You are the one

36:48.815 --> 36:52.601
that keeps this family together.

36:55.822 --> 36:59.260
I ran. You stayed.

37:00.435 --> 37:03.090
I didn't make it easy, though.

37:03.133 --> 37:05.005
I ran a few times, too.

37:05.048 --> 37:06.485
Okay. Right, sure.

37:06.528 --> 37:09.227
But that was to bring me back

37:09.270 --> 37:12.534
when you knew I needed it.

37:12.578 --> 37:15.624
I want you to know
that I see that.

37:15.668 --> 37:18.671
It's okay now.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.760
It's okay to go.

37:22.501 --> 37:25.460
After Mom,

37:25.504 --> 37:29.072
I wasn't sure that
we would ever feel whole again.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.031
Not without her.

37:31.074 --> 37:33.860
And I still feel what's missing.

37:33.903 --> 37:36.558
But I feel hopeful, too.

37:36.602 --> 37:38.647
Good.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.258
Colton and I...

37:41.737 --> 37:43.652
...we're finally feeling good

37:43.696 --> 37:46.481
about what the future
brings, you know?

37:46.525 --> 37:48.744
Good.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.398
Good baby girl.

37:50.442 --> 37:54.489
Um... I can tell you
a little bit about

37:54.533 --> 37:55.708
- what the future brings.
- Mm-hmm.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.449
Um, the future brings

37:57.492 --> 38:00.843
an epic speech
from yours truly, tonight.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.976
- No, Dad.
- Yes. Yes.

38:03.019 --> 38:05.413
No.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.169
Daddy, you remember
what you said to me,

38:22.212 --> 38:25.912
standing right here, on the day
of my high school graduation?

38:25.955 --> 38:29.307
Well, I'd like to think it was
something about being proud.

38:29.350 --> 38:32.092
Yeah, you were.
You did say that.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.399
But you also said,

38:34.442 --> 38:35.791
"I forgive you."

38:35.835 --> 38:37.880
What the hell for?

38:37.924 --> 38:39.795
For leaving.

38:40.883 --> 38:43.364
I know that it bothered you,
me going east.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.584
But you, you supported it.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.934
You let me do that
whole exercise.

38:47.977 --> 38:49.588
Wasn't an exercise.

38:49.631 --> 38:52.025
It did a lot for you,
it made you who you are.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.507
You made me who I am.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.552
You.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.728
Mama.

38:59.772 --> 39:01.774
This family.

39:01.817 --> 39:03.950
And this ranch.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.084
And I thought I needed
something different.

39:08.128 --> 39:11.827
Well, it's not for everyone.

39:11.871 --> 39:16.354
You're right, it is
not for everyone.

39:16.397 --> 39:17.833
But I think it's for me.

39:20.532 --> 39:22.838
So, you're telling me
no regrets?

39:22.882 --> 39:26.189
- What?
- But, uh, I mean,
you must have some regrets.

39:26.233 --> 39:28.409
I know racing me today,

39:28.453 --> 39:30.585
that must be at the top
of your list.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.935
Okay. Yeah, sure.

39:32.979 --> 39:35.808
Uh, in that I regret
having to humiliate a friend?

39:35.851 --> 39:37.810
Yeah. Yeah.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.594
- We're gonna see about that.
- Yeah, we're gonna
see about that.

39:39.638 --> 39:41.335
- For sure.
- But seriously, though.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.294
How is it shaping
your choices, your family?

39:45.295 --> 39:47.515
You know, Trey...

39:47.559 --> 39:51.911
regrets are different
than loss, acceptance.

39:51.954 --> 39:55.218
I mean, I think about
roads not taken every day.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.655
But I wouldn't
change a damn thing

39:56.698 --> 39:58.178
about where I'm coming from.

39:58.221 --> 40:00.659
Yeah.

40:00.702 --> 40:02.748
You're cut out for this.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.011
And, uh, frankly,

40:05.054 --> 40:08.536
the idea of you and me fighting
the good fight together?

40:08.580 --> 40:10.451
That's badass.

40:10.495 --> 40:12.540
Well, I mean, fighting the good
fight with me a couple of paces

40:12.584 --> 40:14.194
- ahead of you, yeah.
- Okay, okay, all right.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.283
Stinger! About time.

40:16.326 --> 40:18.590
You wait till peak temperature
to do this?

40:18.633 --> 40:21.201
Peak temperature? These are
peak training conditions.

40:21.244 --> 40:22.637
You want an honest
race or not?

40:22.681 --> 40:23.856
All right, Stinger,
don't do that race.

40:23.899 --> 40:25.161
You might lose that one.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.467
- Most definitely.
- No.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.513
You remember the rules?

40:28.556 --> 40:30.602
First one to the hitching post
wins? Winner takes the hat.

40:30.645 --> 40:31.820
That'll be me.

40:31.864 --> 40:33.039
- Let's do it.
- Okay. Great.

40:33.082 --> 40:33.909
Three, two, one, go.

40:35.084 --> 40:36.477
Cordi...Did you hear that laugh?

40:36.521 --> 40:37.696
He's full-on cheating.

40:37.739 --> 40:39.175
Is he?

40:39.219 --> 40:40.263
Wait, is he really taking off
right now?

40:40.307 --> 40:41.351
Hustle up, youngsters!

40:41.395 --> 40:42.352
Hey.

40:42.396 --> 40:43.310
I ain't got all day!

40:43.353 --> 40:44.703
Guys, that... Come on!

40:44.746 --> 40:47.532
That's not fair. Cordi!

40:53.842 --> 40:56.323
You ain't getting me!

41:04.070 --> 41:06.028
Damn, where is he?

41:06.072 --> 41:08.509
I don't know, man,
but he should be here.

41:08.553 --> 41:10.511
He must be up ahead.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.875
Too slow, suckers.

41:30.009 --> 41:31.967
That was good.

41:34.187 --> 41:35.623
Where's Dad?
