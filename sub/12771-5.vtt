IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
THE MEDICINE YOU WANT

01:07.125 --> 01:08.709

03:05.208 --> 03:08.083
(speaking inaudibly)

03:08.125 --> 03:09.667
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

03:09.709 --> 03:12.208
CAN'T BE EASY HAVING TO WORK
SIDE BY SIDE WITH YOUR EX.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.041
MOVING ON, OVER HERE
WE HAVE THE CONFERENCE ROOM,

03:14.083 --> 03:16.250

03:22.709 --> 03:25.625
I'M JUST KIDDING.
WE DON'T NAP IN THERE.

03:25.667 --> 03:28.750
OUR PEDIATRICIAN--

03:28.792 --> 03:30.041
HI. HI.

I, UH, I DON'T SEE
THE VALUE IN IT,

03:37.083 --> 03:38.583
BUT NO OFFENSE,
OF COURSE.

03:38.625 --> 03:39.959
(woman) NOT OFFENDED.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.375
NO, I JUST, YOU KNOW,
I PREFER MY ENTERTAINMENT

03:41.417 --> 03:43.083
TO BE
A LITTLE MORE POIGNANT.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.291
(snickers)

03:44.333 --> 03:46.041
I'M SURE HE FORGOT
TO TACK ON

03:46.083 --> 03:47.458
THE, UH, NO OFFENSE--

03:47.500 --> 03:49.083
I SAW THAT REALLY
POWERFUL DOCUMENTARY

03:49.125 --> 03:51.166
ABOUT THE MENINGITIS EPIDEMIC
IN AFRICA

03:51.208 --> 03:54.166
AND ABOUT THE STRUGGLE
TO PROPERLY IMMUNIZE CHILDREN.
(whispers) AFRICA.

03:54.208 --> 03:55.583
DID YOU SEE THAT?
(normal voice) I DID NOT--

03:55.625 --> 03:57.000
'CAUSE THAT IS, LIKE,
A PASSION OF MINE. I FELT--

03:57.041 --> 03:58.083
I SHOT THAT DOCUMENTARY.

03:58.125 --> 03:59.291
OH?

03:59.333 --> 04:00.917
WELL, PART OF IT.
MY COMPANY PRODUCED IT.

04:00.959 --> 04:02.667
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU LIKED IT.

04:02.709 --> 04:05.041
IT'S REAL--
IT'S REALLY GOOD WORK...

04:05.083 --> 04:06.291
YEAH.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.166

DO SOME WORK.

04:11.333 --> 04:12.500
OKAY.

04:12.542 --> 04:13.709
(chuckles) GOOD LUCK.

04:13.750 --> 04:14.959
THAT'S DR. FREEDMAN.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.041
OH, AND HERE WE HAVE
DR. CHARLOTTE KING.

04:18.083 --> 04:21.875
SHE IS A UROLOGIST,
A SEXOLOGIST,

04:21.917 --> 04:23.542
AND, UH, MY BOSS--
EVERYBODY'S BOSS--

04:23.583 --> 04:25.500
OVER AT ST. AMBROSE.

04:25.542 --> 04:27.125
NOW LET ME BE CLEAR.

04:27.166 --> 04:29.917
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME
FOR YOU TO BE IN MY HOSPITAL,

04:29.959 --> 04:32.709
BUT SAM ASKED, SO YOU HAVE
ACCESS TO WHATEVER YOU NEED.

04:32.750 --> 04:34.291
BUT GET IN SOMEBODY'S WAY,

04:34.333 --> 04:36.667
AND I WILL USE THAT CAMERA

04:36.709 --> 04:38.041
NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:38.083 --> 04:39.875
HA HA.

04:39.917 --> 04:43.417
OKAY, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT CHARLOTTE KING.

04:43.458 --> 04:46.208
SHE'S ALSO PREGNANT...

04:46.250 --> 04:48.959
WITH TRIPLETS,

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
WHICH SHOULD BE INTERESTING.

04:52.041 --> 04:54.375
ONE CREAM. ONE SUGAR.

04:54.417 --> 04:57.041
I'M SURE AMERICA'S SITTING
ON THE EDGES OF THEIR SEAT

04:57.083 --> 04:59.041
RIGHT NOW.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.750
HEY.

05:00.792 --> 05:04.750
(woman) CUT.
SHE DIDN'T SIGN THE WAIVER.

05:04.792 --> 05:06.041
YOUR ASS SO STACKS UP

05:06.083 --> 05:07.667
WITH THE ENTIRE
KARDASHIAN FAMILY.

05:07.709 --> 05:09.041
OH, LET ME GUESS.

05:09.083 --> 05:10.667
REALITY TV
IS BENEATH YOU, TOO.

05:10.709 --> 05:12.083
I'M JUST THE ONLY ONE
WILLING TO SAY SO

05:12.125 --> 05:13.875
BY NOT SIGNING THE WAIVER.

05:13.917 --> 05:15.500
I MEAN,
DO YOU WATCH THIS STUFF?

05:15.542 --> 05:17.709
"MY SUPER SWEET BITCHTEEN"?

05:17.750 --> 05:18.917
"PIMP MY KAYAK"?

05:18.959 --> 05:21.083
LOOK, I DID NOT
SEEK THIS OUT, ALL RIGHT?

05:21.125 --> 05:23.041
ONE OF MY PATIENTS
IS A NETWORK EXEC.

05:23.083 --> 05:25.291
SHE STARTED CALLING,
WOULDN'T STOP, SO I SAID,

05:25.333 --> 05:27.291
"WHY NOT?
I CAN BE A ROLE MODEL."

05:27.333 --> 05:28.709
JUST PROMISE TO GIVE ME
THE HEADS-UP

05:28.750 --> 05:30.208
BEFORE THE SEX TAPE
GETS LEAKED.

05:30.250 --> 05:31.500
(laughs)

05:31.542 --> 05:33.583
HEY, SWEETIE MAN.

(laughs)

05:44.834 --> 05:46.000
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

05:46.041 --> 05:47.041
A WOMAN LIKES
A LITTLE ATTENTION,

05:47.083 --> 05:48.583
BUT DO THEY HAVE TO BE
ALL UP IN MY FACE?

05:48.625 --> 05:50.583
MAMA, I TOLD YOU THEY WERE
GONNA BE FILMING.

05:50.625 --> 05:52.000

06:02.792 --> 06:05.041
STOP, STOP. HE'S YOUR BOSS
AND AN OLD FRIEND.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.041
OH.

06:11.375 --> 06:13.875
HI. I, UH... (chuckles)

06:13.917 --> 06:16.000
I HAD--I HAD NO IDEA

06:16.041 --> 06:19.583
WELL, I-I FIGURED SAM
WOULD LET YOU KNOW.

06:19.625 --> 06:22.041
OH. (chuckles)
YEAH, HE, UH...

06:22.083 --> 06:24.041

06:24.083 --> 06:27.041
WE DON'T, UH...

06:27.083 --> 06:29.041
I SPEAK WITH MY SON
QUITE A BIT.

06:29.083 --> 06:32.041
RIGHT. OF COURSE,
OF COURSE, SO...

06:32.083 --> 06:36.375
WELL, IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU, AND, UM...

06:36.417 --> 06:38.500
I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING
MORE OF YOU WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.041
I'M SURE I'M GONNA
SEE YOU MORE BEFORE YOU GO.

06:40.083 --> 06:44.208
I MEAN, I'M NOT...
D-DEMANDING IT. (chuckles)

06:46.083 --> 06:50.834
SO I'M GONNA... GO.

06:54.917 --> 06:56.667
WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT CAMERA
THAT WAS FOLLOWING YOU AROUND?

06:56.709 --> 06:58.250
OH, I TOLD 'EM
TO WAIT OUTSIDE.

06:58.291 --> 07:01.291
WELL, JILLIAN WAS HOPING
THAT SHE COULD TELL HER FRIENDS

07:01.333 --> 07:02.500
THAT WHEN SHE CAME OUT
TO HOLLYWOOD

07:02.542 --> 07:03.709
AND SHE GOT ON A TV SHOW.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.333
NO, THAT'S WHAT YOU
WERE HOPING FOR.

07:06.375 --> 07:07.667
(laughs)

07:07.709 --> 07:09.041
(chuckles) WELL, WE COULD
MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

07:09.083 --> 07:10.333
LOOK AT HIM, JILLIAN--

07:10.375 --> 07:12.041
SHARP SUIT, IT FITS HIM WELL.
(laughs)

07:12.083 --> 07:14.208
I REMEMBER WHEN YOU USED TO
VISIT THE PRINT SHOP.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.458
YOU'D GET SO WORKED UP
CHASING CORINNE AROUND

07:16.500 --> 07:19.041
THAT YOU HAD TO WHEEZE
INTO AN INHALER.

07:19.083 --> 07:20.291
RIGHT.
(laughs)

07:20.333 --> 07:21.417
HOW IS SHE?

07:21.458 --> 07:23.959
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE'S GOOD.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.917
CORINNE IS, UH,
YOU KNOW, SHE'S--

07:25.959 --> 07:27.041
SHE'S GOOD.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.667
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.041
MM. WELL...
(chuckles)

07:30.083 --> 07:31.625
ALL RIGHT, YOU JUST RELAX.

07:31.667 --> 07:33.417
I'M GONNA START
THIS E.K.G.
(beeping)

07:33.458 --> 07:36.041
UH, MOM SAID YOU WERE
AT THE EMERGENCY ROOM

07:36.083 --> 07:37.500
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

07:37.542 --> 07:39.667
YEAH, I WAS WORKING
A FEW HOURS ON THE PRESS.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.041
I TOOK A STEP BACK,

07:41.083 --> 07:42.792
NEXT THING I REMEMBER,
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.166
HE DIDN'T TELL 'EM
THAT HE CAN HARDLY GET

07:44.208 --> 07:46.166
TO THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
WITHOUT TAKING A BREAK,

07:46.208 --> 07:49.041
AND IT'S BEEN GETTING WORSE.

07:49.083 --> 07:50.333
ANY CHEST PAINS?

07:50.375 --> 07:52.166
(chuckles) I'M 73 YEARS OLD.
I GOT PAIN EVERYWHERE.

07:52.208 --> 07:53.667
OKAY.

07:53.709 --> 07:54.875
(whirring)

07:54.917 --> 07:57.500
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO WE GOT HERE?

07:57.542 --> 07:58.917
HUH.

07:58.959 --> 08:01.041
WH-WHAT IS IT?

08:01.083 --> 08:02.458
UH, WELL, RAYMOND'S E.K.G.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.917
IS SHOWING SOME
NONSPECIFIC ABNORMALITIES.

08:04.959 --> 08:07.041
I'D LIKE TO GET YOU
OVER TO ST. AMBROSE,

08:07.083 --> 08:08.542
HAVE THEM RUN
A COUPLE OF MORE TESTS.

08:08.583 --> 08:10.500
ALL RIGHT? WE'RE GONNA
GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS.

08:10.542 --> 08:13.083
SO THEY SHOULD BE FINISHING UP
WITH RAYMOND'S TESTS

08:13.125 --> 08:14.709
IN ABOUT AN HOUR.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.917
I ORDERED A, UH, A CHEST C.T.
AND AN ECHOCARDIOGRAM.

08:16.959 --> 08:19.208
WHICH CAMERA
SHOULD I BE FOCUSING ON?

08:19.250 --> 08:20.625
JUST LOOK AT ME.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.208
JUST--OKAY.

08:22.250 --> 08:25.041
YOU SEEM REALLY TIGHT
WITH YOUR MOM.

08:25.083 --> 08:28.709
UH, YES. UH...
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THERE.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.709
SO WAS MY MOM, AND I STILL
HAVEN'T AMASSED

08:30.750 --> 08:33.291
THE REQUISITE HOURS OF THERAPY
TO MOVE PAST IT.

08:33.333 --> 08:37.041
(laughs) UH, WELL, I JUST--
I ADMIRE HER FOR, UH,

08:37.083 --> 08:39.625
FOR ALL THAT SHE'S DONE.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.041
LIKE?

08:41.083 --> 08:43.041
WELL, SHE RAISED ME.

08:43.083 --> 08:45.583
HALF A MILLION PEOPLE
JUST REACHED FOR THEIR REMOTES.

08:45.625 --> 08:47.000
(chuckles)

08:47.041 --> 08:48.792
GIVE ME SOMETHING
TO WORK WITH, SAM.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.041
(clears throat)

08:50.083 --> 08:52.041
YOU'RE A DOCTOR
RAISED BY A SINGLE MOM.

08:52.083 --> 08:54.333
OH, SEE, THAT RIGHT THERE.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.041
I HATE THAT TERM,
"SINGLE MOM."

08:57.083 --> 09:00.000
IT IMPLIES THAT SHE, UH,
THAT SHE WAS SOMETHING LESS

09:00.041 --> 09:01.750
OR THAT I MISSED OUT
ON SOMETHING,

09:01.792 --> 09:03.333
AND I...

09:03.375 --> 09:05.041
I MEAN, MY MOTHER SPENT
WAY MORE TIME WITH ME

09:05.083 --> 09:08.208
THAN SOME KIDS THAT HAD A FATHER
AND A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

09:08.250 --> 09:11.250
UH, YOU KNOW, SHE NEVER MISSED
A PARENT-TEACHER MEETING.

09:11.291 --> 09:14.041
SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME
EVERY DAY.

09:14.083 --> 09:16.375
SHE POPPED ME
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD

09:16.417 --> 09:20.041
WHENEVER I NEEDED TO BE POPPED
IN THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

09:20.083 --> 09:22.041
MY, UH, MY HIGH SCHOOL
SUPERLATIVES

09:22.083 --> 09:25.709
WERE CLASS NICEST
AND MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.417
I WON THE MORRIS GRANT
MY SECOND YEAR AT GEORGETOWN,

09:28.458 --> 09:31.667
AFTER MY MOTHER SOMEHOW MANAGED
TO PAY FOR THE FIRST.

09:31.709 --> 09:33.083
I AM ONE OF

09:33.125 --> 09:36.041
THE BEST CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEONS
IN THE COUNTRY,

09:36.083 --> 09:38.375
AND I'M A BLACK MAN.

09:38.417 --> 09:41.041
SO...

09:41.083 --> 09:43.250
NOW YOU KNOW.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.667
NOW I KNOW WHAT?

09:44.709 --> 09:48.250
WHY I HATE THE TERM
"SINGLE MOM."

09:48.291 --> 09:51.041
A GIRL WENT MISSING
FROM THE E.R. A FEW DAYS AGO.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.834
THERE HAS BEEN
A 24-HOUR PRESENCE HERE

09:53.875 --> 09:55.333
EVER SINCE.

09:55.375 --> 09:58.834
UH, DR. FREEDMAN
AND--AND, UH, DR. TURNER

09:58.875 --> 10:00.542
HAVE BEEN SPEARHEADING
THE EFFORTS.

10:00.583 --> 10:01.959
ARE YOU GETTING ALL THIS?

10:02.000 --> 10:03.333
THIS IS AMAZING.

10:03.375 --> 10:05.500
MOST OF THESE PEOPLE HAVE TAKEN
SICK DAYS TO BE HERE TODAY.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.500
WE LAUNCH SEARCH PARTIES
TWICE A DAY.

10:07.542 --> 10:10.041
(woman) WHAT IS EVERYONE'S
CONNECTION TO THE LITTLE GIRL?

10:10.083 --> 10:11.709
UH, SARAH'S MY PATIENT.

10:11.750 --> 10:14.041
I'VE BEEN COUNSELING THE PARENTS
SINCE HER DISAPPEARANCE.

10:14.083 --> 10:17.083
SHE WENT MISSING
FROM MY E.R.

10:17.125 --> 10:19.083
UH, YOU SHOULD REALLY TALK
TO THE PARENTS.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.500
UM, WE'RE TRYING TO UTILIZE,

10:20.542 --> 10:22.667
UM, ALL THE PRESS
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE.

10:22.709 --> 10:26.875
UM, THEY ARE, UH, DOING A-A SHOW
ABOUT MY COLLEAGUE, DR. BENNETT.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.792
(woman) HOW ARE YOU
HOLDING IT TOGETHER?

10:28.834 --> 10:31.458
(exhales) WE'RE TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

10:31.500 --> 10:33.500
WE WANT TO BE STRONG
FOR SARAH,

10:33.542 --> 10:35.041
WHEREVER SHE IS.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.291
(exhales deeply)
DON'T GIVE UP, BABY.

10:36.333 --> 10:38.041
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.917
SO I'VE LOOKED OVER
THE RESULTS.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.500
I-I SHOULD LET YOU ALL
HAVE SOME TIME.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.041
OH, NO. YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LEAVE, DEE.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.041
NO, THEY MIGHT AS WELL
BOTH HEAR

10:46.083 --> 10:49.709
SINCE THEY'RE GONNA STOP ME
FROM ENJOYING MYSELF AT HOME

10:49.750 --> 10:53.041
AND AT WORK. (chuckles)

10:53.083 --> 10:54.083
OKAY.

10:54.125 --> 10:56.166
WELL, YOU HAVE
PULMONARY HYPERTENSION.

10:56.208 --> 10:58.834
YOU'RE THROWING BLOOD CLOTS
INTO THE ARTERIES OF YOUR LUNGS,

10:58.875 --> 11:00.875
WHICH IS RAISING
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE

11:00.917 --> 11:02.709
TO A VERY DANGEROUS LEVEL.

11:02.750 --> 11:04.041
THAT'S WHY HE FAINTED?

11:04.083 --> 11:06.000
WELL, THAT'S WHY
HE'S BEEN HAVING THE CHEST PAINS

11:06.041 --> 11:09.166
AND WHY CLIMBING STAIRS
FEELS LIKE MOUNT EVEREST.

11:09.208 --> 11:10.792
WHAT CAN YOU DO?

11:10.834 --> 11:13.000
WELL, WE'LL PUT YOU ON
SOME ANTICOAGULANTS,

11:13.041 --> 11:15.208
WHICH WILL PREVENT
NEW CLOTS FROM FORMING.

11:15.250 --> 11:17.834
THEN I'LL INSERT
A VASCULAR UMBRELLA

11:17.875 --> 11:19.917
WHICH WILL CATCH
THE EXISTING CLOTS,

11:19.959 --> 11:23.208
AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT THEM
FROM, UH, BREAKING AWAY.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.750
THIS, HOPEFULLY,
WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM.

11:25.792 --> 11:27.041
WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

11:27.083 --> 11:29.333
WELL, IF WE DON'T LOWER
YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE,

11:29.375 --> 11:33.041
YOUR HEART WILL OVERWORK ITSELF
UNTIL IT FAILS.

11:33.083 --> 11:36.875
THIS IS CRITICAL.

11:36.917 --> 11:39.000
UM... IS THERE, UH, UH,

11:39.041 --> 11:41.959
OH, WHERE'S THE UH,
UH, RESTROOM?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.542
OH, RIGHT THIS WAY.

11:43.583 --> 11:45.125
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

11:45.166 --> 11:47.333
IT'S, UH, TO THE RIGHT.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.375
(people speaking indistinctly)

11:52.667 --> 11:54.041
IT'S OVER HERE.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.959
(crying) HE NEEDS ME
TO BE STRONG.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.125
YOU WILL BE, OKAY?

11:57.166 --> 11:59.542
THE BATHROOM'S RIGHT HERE.
I'M GONNA HEAD BACK.

11:59.583 --> 12:02.500
JILLIAN, YOU HAVE
A GREAT MARRIAGE.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.834
THIS IS JUST
ANOTHER CHALLENGE.

12:04.875 --> 12:06.083
(Jillian sniffles)

12:06.125 --> 12:09.208
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

12:13.125 --> 12:16.083
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

12:22.917 --> 12:24.041
(woman) ARE WE GONNA TALK ABOUT
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM?

12:24.083 --> 12:25.250
NOT IF I DON'T SEE ONE.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.458
YOUR MOTHER AND RAYMOND--

12:26.500 --> 12:27.667
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THEM.

12:27.709 --> 12:28.875
SAM, I--

12:28.917 --> 12:30.500
LOOK... (sighs)

12:30.542 --> 12:33.041
NOW IF YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT EDUCATING KIDS

12:33.083 --> 12:34.625
ON HEART HEALTH

12:34.667 --> 12:38.458
OR CUTTING-EDGE TECHNIQUES
TO REPAIR CONGENITAL DEFECTS,

12:38.500 --> 12:40.041
I'M YOUR MAN.

12:40.083 --> 12:44.083
BUT MY MOTHER'S PERSONAL LIFE
IS NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

12:48.583 --> 12:50.041
(mouth full) I WAS GLAD
I GOT TO VISIT

12:50.083 --> 12:52.125
WITH CORINNE TODAY.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.291
SHE LOOKS GOOD.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.917
SHE SMILED.

12:57.959 --> 13:02.041
I DIDN'T THINK I WOULD EVER
SEE THAT AGAIN.

13:02.083 --> 13:03.709
SAM...

13:03.750 --> 13:05.208
YOU DID GOOD FOR HER.

13:05.250 --> 13:08.041
YOU DID EVERYTHING
THAT YOU COULD.

13:08.083 --> 13:09.750
IS THAT WHY
SHE WON'T SEE ME?

13:11.542 --> 13:14.000
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS, IF THAT'S OKAY.

13:20.291 --> 13:21.750
ISN'T THAT ENOUGH?

13:24.333 --> 13:27.041
GIVE ME THIS.
YOU HAVE HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE.

13:27.083 --> 13:30.041
HOW MANY TIMES DO I
HAVE TO TELL YOU--CUT BACK?

13:30.083 --> 13:32.792
WE DON'T HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT CORINNE.

13:32.834 --> 13:36.000
BUT YOU HAVE NO CALL
TO BE NASTY TO ME.

13:40.333 --> 13:42.041
(sighs)

13:42.083 --> 13:45.125
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS NOT RIGHT, WITH RAYMOND.

13:48.542 --> 13:49.792
I SAW YOU TWO.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.500
I THOUGHT I TAUGHT YOU

13:54.542 --> 13:56.041
NOT TO SPEAK ON THINGS
YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT.

13:56.083 --> 13:58.917
HE IS MARRIED. HE'S YOUR B-BOSS.
JILLIAN IS YOUR FRIEND, AND--

13:58.959 --> 14:01.458
SAM, ENOUGH.

14:03.750 --> 14:06.542
IT'S NOT RIGHT,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

14:08.792 --> 14:14.041
I HAVE WORKED SIDE BY SIDE
WITH THAT MAN FOR A LONG TIME.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.166
THINGS HAPPEN,

14:16.208 --> 14:17.792
THINGS YOU WISH NEVER DID,

14:17.834 --> 14:20.000
BUT THAT'S
FOR ME TO DEAL WITH,

14:22.083 --> 14:24.667
NEXT TIME YOU THINK ABOUT
KEEPING SOMETHING TO YOURSELF

14:24.709 --> 14:26.625
SO YOU DON'T DISRESPECT
YOUR MOTHER,

14:26.667 --> 14:28.417
YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THROUGH
WITH IT.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.834
(sighs)

14:31.208 --> 14:32.667
THANK YOU FOR DINNER,

14:32.709 --> 14:34.667
BUT I AM NOT HUNGRY.

14:34.709 --> 14:36.458
(chair scrapes floor)

14:40.291 --> 14:43.041
OF COURSE SAM HAS THE PERFECT
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS MOTHER,

14:43.083 --> 14:44.959
BECAUSE SAM
IS THE PERFECT MAN.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.834
I MEAN, HE'S LIKE
A LIVING, BREATHING

14:47.875 --> 14:49.583
"MEN'S HEALTH" MAGAZINE,

14:49.625 --> 14:51.375
LIKE "HOW TO HAVE
THE PERFECT WAIST,"

14:51.417 --> 14:54.959
"HOW TO MAKE WOMEN SWOON
OVER YOUR BALD HEAD."

14:57.125 --> 14:59.500
HEY, WHAT IS--WHAT IS HE
GETTING PAID FOR THIS?

14:59.542 --> 15:01.792
(woman) NOTHING YET.
IT'S JUST A PILOT.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.000
PILOT, RIGHT.

15:03.041 --> 15:04.291
BUT IF IT, UH, GETS PICKED UP,

15:04.333 --> 15:06.583
HE GETS LIKE $20,000
OR $30,000?

15:06.625 --> 15:08.041
YEAH...

15:08.083 --> 15:09.709
AN EPISODE.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.834
AN EPISODE?

15:11.875 --> 15:15.000
FOR JUST DOING WHAT HE ALREADY
NORMALLY DOES, HE GET...

15:15.041 --> 15:17.250
(laughs) THAT IS INSANE.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.875
I MEAN, I...

15:18.917 --> 15:20.250
I GOOGLED IT LAST NIGHT--

15:20.291 --> 15:22.417
THE COST OF RAISING
A CHILD IN L.A.--

15:22.458 --> 15:24.041
HALF A MILLION DOLLARS.

15:24.083 --> 15:25.208
AND I ALREADY HAVE ONE.

15:25.250 --> 15:30.041
I'M HAVING THREE MORE,
ALL AT ONCE.

15:30.083 --> 15:32.208
YOU EVER THOUGHT OF, UH,
DOING A SHOW

15:32.250 --> 15:33.959
ABOUT A PEDIATRICIAN?

15:43.250 --> 15:46.250
(indistinct conversations)

15:49.500 --> 15:51.458
...IS AT THE END
OF THE BAR. (laughs)

15:51.500 --> 15:52.709
(laughs)

15:52.750 --> 15:54.041
(Raymond)
IS SHE STILL DRINKING?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.709
(Jillian laughing)

15:55.750 --> 15:57.125
(Raymond laughs) COME ON.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.750
WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?
(laughs)

15:58.792 --> 15:59.959
IT'S NOT A HOSPITAL,
IT'S A ZOO.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.500
IF I DON'T HAVE
A DETECTIVE IN MY EAR,

16:01.542 --> 16:02.917
I GOT A CAMERA IN MY FACE.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.709
OH, WHO INVITED RULES MAGEE?

16:04.750 --> 16:06.041
I DID.

16:06.083 --> 16:07.041
(lowered voice)
JUST BE NICE, COOPER.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.250
JAMES HAS BEEN DOING
A LOT FOR SARAH.

16:08.291 --> 16:09.875
(Charlotte) HEY THERE.

16:09.917 --> 16:11.041
WHEN I LEFT THE HOSPITAL,
THE DETECTIVES WERE STILL THERE.

16:11.083 --> 16:12.458
DID THEY HAVE ANYTHING?
(Charlotte) NOTHING.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.166
THEY'RE STILL INTERVIEWING
EMPLOYEES AND PATIENTS

16:14.208 --> 16:16.041
WHO MAY HAVE HAD ACCESS.
AND THAT'S A TALL ORDER

16:16.083 --> 16:18.083
GIVEN THE VOLUME
IN THE E.R. THAT NIGHT.

16:18.125 --> 16:19.500
I MEAN,
HOW ARE RON AND DANA?

16:19.542 --> 16:21.083
OH, A MESS.
IT'S A ROLLER COASTER.

16:21.125 --> 16:22.709
THEY WERE AT EACH OTHER'S
THROATS BEFORE.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.041
EVEN SOLID COUPLES FIND IT
HARD TO STAY TOGETHER

16:24.083 --> 16:25.500
IN THE FACE OF SOMETHING
LIKE THIS.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.667
I JUST...
WISH I COULD DO MORE.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.542
SHORT OF FINDING SARAH...

16:37.125 --> 16:38.291
(laughs) YES.

16:38.333 --> 16:41.291
I LIKE IT. I DO.

16:41.333 --> 16:42.583
OKAY, YOU LOOK RIDICULOUS.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.000
THEY WANT ME
TO LOOK RIDICULOUS

16:44.041 --> 16:45.291
SO I GIVE UP
AND SIGN THE WAIVER.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.041
WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT

16:47.083 --> 16:49.041
I HAVE A FREAKISHLY STRONG
LEFT ARM.

16:49.083 --> 16:51.041
(laughs)
AND NOW YOU SOUND RIDICULOUS.

16:51.083 --> 16:55.333
I HAVEN'T EATEN ENOUGH HOT DOGS
TO JUSTIFY BEING AT A BARBECUE.

16:56.875 --> 17:00.375
UGH. SAM'S MOM HATES ME.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.959
SHE DOESN'T HATE YOU.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.625
OH, YES, SHE DOES.
SHE ALWAYS HAS.

17:04.667 --> 17:05.834
IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT AT GRADUATION DINNER,

17:05.875 --> 17:07.625
BIZZY GOT DRUNK AND ASKED HER

17:07.667 --> 17:10.667
IF "AMISTAD" WAS AN ACCURATE
PORTRAYAL OF SLAVERY.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.041
(laughs)

17:12.083 --> 17:13.959
WHAT--WHAT DID SHE SAY?

17:14.000 --> 17:16.709
"I'LL ASK MY SLAVE FRIENDS."

17:18.500 --> 17:21.500
(indistinct conversations)

17:32.083 --> 17:34.250
I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD
CONSIDERING

17:34.291 --> 17:36.291
YOU STUCK SOMETHING IN MY CHEST
A FEW DAYS AGO.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.041
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS A SIMPLE PROCEDURE.

17:39.083 --> 17:42.375
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
CROSS MARK THOSE STEAKS?

17:42.417 --> 17:45.583
NO. IT DOESN'T MAKE THE STEAKS
TASTE ANY BETTER.

17:45.625 --> 17:49.500
MM. WELL, SOMETHING TO BE SAID
FOR A GOOD-LOOKING STEAK.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.792
(clears throat)

17:51.834 --> 17:53.041
(steaks sizzling)

17:53.083 --> 17:54.291
IT'S COMPLICATED.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.709
IT'S NOT COMPLICATED
TO KEEP THE VOWS

17:55.750 --> 17:57.875
THAT YOU MADE TO YOUR WIFE.

17:57.917 --> 18:01.458
IT'S NOT SOME FLING.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.458
I LOVE DEE.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.542
I DON'T CARE.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.041
YOU THINK THAT MAKES ME
FEEL ANY BETTER

18:09.083 --> 18:11.959
THAT YOU'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH MY MOTHER?

18:13.959 --> 18:16.291
OKAY... NOW I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS HER

18:16.333 --> 18:18.709
AND I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS YOUR WIFE.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.709
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON
I'M NOT ASKING YOU

18:20.750 --> 18:22.083
TO GET THE HELL OUTTA
MY HOUSE,

18:22.125 --> 18:24.542
BUT YOU SHOULD GET OUTTA
OF MY FACE RIGHT NOW...

18:26.125 --> 18:29.458
JUST GET OUTTA MY FACE.
GET OUTTA MY FACE.

18:34.291 --> 18:36.250
(footsteps approach)

18:36.291 --> 18:39.041
PAPARAZZI AFTER YOU AGAIN?

18:39.083 --> 18:41.417
I'M SURE YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO MUG FOR THE CAMERAS.

18:41.458 --> 18:43.041
I STRIKE YOU
AS THAT KIND OF GUY?

18:43.083 --> 18:44.083
YOU'RE AN E.R. DOC.

18:44.125 --> 18:46.500
YOU PROBABLY DRIVE
A TINY FOREIGN SPORTS CAR

18:46.542 --> 18:49.750
OR A JEEP WITH NO DOORS
AND A SURFBOARD OUT THE BACK,

18:49.792 --> 18:53.166
AND TOPS ON YOUR BUCKET LIST
IS TO COMPLETE AN IRONMAN.

18:53.208 --> 18:55.917
I ONLY BUY AMERICAN, THERE
AREN'T MANY WAVES IN TENNESSEE,

18:55.959 --> 18:58.875
AND I FINISHED
MY FIRST IRONMAN LAST YEAR.

18:58.917 --> 19:02.709
YOU ARE WRONG... A LOT.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.041
(sizzling)

19:09.083 --> 19:10.709
HEY, MAN.
YOU GET ENOUGH TO EAT?

19:10.750 --> 19:12.041
YEAH, STUFFED.

19:12.083 --> 19:13.291
ALL RIGHT.

19:13.333 --> 19:16.709
HEY, SAM, WHY ARE YOU, UH,
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

19:16.750 --> 19:19.709
OH, THIS WASN'T MY IDEA.
IT'S THE PRODUCER.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.291
SHE SAID
SHE JUST NEEDED AN EVENT

19:21.333 --> 19:23.125
TO GET EVERYBODY TOGETHER
IN THE SAME PLACE.

19:23.166 --> 19:25.083
NO, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS,

19:25.125 --> 19:27.291
THE--THE WHOLE
REALITY SHOW THING?

19:27.333 --> 19:30.500
IT DOESN'T REALLY
SEEM LIKE YOU.

19:30.542 --> 19:32.083
UH... (clears throat)

19:32.125 --> 19:35.542
PATIENTS COME TO ME
WITH MISINFORMATION EVERY DAY.

19:35.583 --> 19:37.208
THIS JUST GIVES ME
AN OPPORTUNITY

19:37.250 --> 19:41.125
TO DEBUNK UNHEALTHY MYTHS
THAT COST PEOPLE THEIR LIVES.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.500
YOU KNOW THAT SOUNDS REHEARSED,
RIGHT?

19:43.542 --> 19:45.083
HELP! SOMEONE HELP HIM!

19:45.125 --> 19:46.917
(Dee) SAM.
RAYMOND.

19:46.959 --> 19:49.125
LET'S GO. LET'S GET THIS.
RAYMOND, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

19:49.166 --> 19:51.834
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.
DON'T YOU GO ANYWHERE.
(monitor emitting
continuous tone)

19:51.875 --> 19:53.834
(woman) SAM, HOW ARE YOU FEELING
RIGHT NOW?

19:53.875 --> 19:56.583
GET AWAY! GET AWAY
OR GET OUT!

19:56.625 --> 19:58.458
(Dee) SAM, TALK TO ME.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.208
CHARGING TO 360.
(defibrillator whining)

20:00.250 --> 20:02.542
ALL RIGHT.
CLEAR.

20:02.583 --> 20:03.875
(defibrillator beeps,
paddles thunk)

20:03.917 --> 20:05.458
(tone continues)
OH, DAMN IT.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.041
ALL RIGHT,
HE'S STILL IN FIB.

20:07.083 --> 20:08.875
WE NEED TO GET HIM STABILIZED
AND GET HIM IN THE O.R.

20:08.917 --> 20:10.250
AND GET RID OF THESE CLOTS.

20:10.291 --> 20:11.959
(woman) I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE'RE GETTING THIS.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
CLEAR.
(defibrillator beeps)

20:14.041 --> 20:16.250
(thunk)

20:16.291 --> 20:18.792
(sighs and whispers)
COME ON. COME ON. COME ON.

20:18.834 --> 20:21.125
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

20:21.166 --> 20:22.583
SINUS.
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

20:22.625 --> 20:24.041
ALL RIGHT. HE'S BACK.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.583
(Jillian)
WILL HE BE OKAY?

20:25.625 --> 20:28.709
I DON'T KNOW. LET'S GO.
COME ON. GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

20:28.750 --> 20:32.250
(indistinct conversations)

20:32.291 --> 20:36.041
SAM, PLEASE, JUST SAVE--
JUST SAVE HIM. SAVE HIM.

20:36.083 --> 20:37.291
ALL RIGHT.

20:37.333 --> 20:38.709
(man) YOU GOT IT?
(man) YEAH, YEAH.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.667
(indistinct conversations
continue)

20:46.041 --> 20:47.166
(woman) WE CUT TOGETHER
SOME FOOTAGE FROM THE SURGERY.

20:47.208 --> 20:49.250
CAN YOU JUST TAKE US THROUGH
WHAT WENT WRONG?

20:49.291 --> 20:51.000
YEAH.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.875
OKAY, I HAD ALREADY...
(sighs)

20:52.917 --> 20:56.417
ALREADY REMOVED
THE MAJOR OBSTRUCTION.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.208
UH, I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY

20:58.250 --> 21:01.041
TO GET SOME OF THE OTHER
ACCUMULATED BLOOD CLOTS.

21:01.083 --> 21:02.291
WHAT DID YOU SAY THERE?

21:02.333 --> 21:06.834
THAT I NEEDED A DIFFERENTIAL
V.Q. SCAN, UH, POST-SURGERY.

21:06.875 --> 21:10.417
I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT
RAYMOND'S LUNG FUNCTION,

21:10.458 --> 21:11.834
UH, GOING FORWARD.

21:11.875 --> 21:14.125
AT THIS POINT,
WE WERE READY TO CLOSE.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.625
OKAY, HERE IS WHEN HE STARTED
TO BLEED INTO HIS CHEST.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.542
THE ANTICOAGULANTS
HAD MADE IT DIFFICULT

21:19.583 --> 21:21.625
FOR HIS BLOOD TO CLOT.

21:21.667 --> 21:22.959
UH, I DON'T KNOW.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.875
I GUESS MAYBE I KEPT HIM
OPEN TOO LONG.

21:25.917 --> 21:27.875
I THOUGHT I COULD DO MORE.

21:27.917 --> 21:30.041
WHAT DID THE DOCTOR
SAY THERE?

21:30.083 --> 21:32.041
THAT IF WE DIDN'T STOP
THE BLEEDING,

21:32.083 --> 21:33.709
RAYMOND WOULD DIE.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.083
AND WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

21:35.125 --> 21:38.291
UH, THAT IF I DIDN'T STOP
THE BLEEDING,

21:38.333 --> 21:41.166
RAYMOND WOULD DIE.

21:41.208 --> 21:43.583
MEDICINE IS A SCIENCE,
BUT IT'S ALSO PERSONAL.

21:43.625 --> 21:45.750
AS DOCTORS, WE WANT TO BELIEVE

21:45.792 --> 21:47.375
THAT NO MATTER
WHO'S ON THAT TABLE,

21:47.417 --> 21:50.291
WE PROVIDE THE SAME CARE,
BUT IT'S JUST NOT TRUE.

21:50.333 --> 21:52.041
I'M NOT SAYING THAT,
AS DOCTORS,

21:52.083 --> 21:54.083
WE DON'T PROVIDE
QUALITY CARE TO EVERYONE,

21:54.125 --> 21:57.041
BUT MAYBE WITH--
WITH SOME PATIENTS,

21:57.083 --> 22:01.166
WE--WE DO A LITTLE MORE,
WE--WE FIGHT A LITTLE HARDER.

22:01.208 --> 22:02.500
AND IN THOSE CASES,

22:02.542 --> 22:05.041
WHEN WE DON'T GET
THE--THE RESULTS WE WANT,

22:05.083 --> 22:07.125
IT HURTS.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.917
BUT WHEN WE DO, IT'S, UH...

22:09.959 --> 22:14.000
(chuckles) IT'S TOUGH
TO BEAT THAT FEELING.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.583
(people speak indistinctly)

22:15.625 --> 22:18.917
YOU NEED A NEW LUNG,
RAYMOND.

22:18.959 --> 22:21.000
YOU CAN GET HIM
ON THE LIST, RIGHT?

22:21.041 --> 22:22.417
I-ISN'T THERE A LIST?

22:22.458 --> 22:24.583
YES, BUT PEOPLE USUALLY
END UP DYING

22:24.625 --> 22:26.792
WAITING FOR A MATCH, AND THAT'S
OVER THE COURSE OF YEARS.

22:26.834 --> 22:28.417
RAYMOND DOESN'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF TIME.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.375
(Dee) WE'LL FIND IT.
WE'LL FIND A LUNG.

22:30.417 --> 22:31.917
NO, HE'LL BE FINE.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.083
WE SHOULD START CONSIDERING

22:33.125 --> 22:35.083
LIVING RELATED DONOR
TRANSPLANT.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.625
WE TAKE A LOBE
FROM A RELATIVE,

22:37.667 --> 22:40.041
AND THEN REPLACE
THE DAMAGED LUNG WITH THAT.

22:40.083 --> 22:43.000
WE SHOULD GET AS MANY PEOPLE
TESTED AS WE CAN.

22:43.041 --> 22:44.375
WHO DO YOU ASK
FOR A LUNG?

22:44.417 --> 22:46.625
I KNOW YOU AND JILLIAN
DON'T HAVE ANY CHILDREN.

22:46.667 --> 22:49.041
HOW ABOUT SIBLINGS,
NIECES, NEPHEWS?

22:49.083 --> 22:51.417
NO, NO, NO.

22:51.458 --> 22:53.458
I GUESS THAT'S IT.

22:53.500 --> 22:55.041
I JUST GO HOME
AND WAIT TO DIE.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.458
YOU ARE NOT GIVING UP.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.000
OH, WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE?

22:59.041 --> 23:00.041
WE NEED TO PRAY.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.417
PRAY?

23:03.458 --> 23:06.041
YOU WANT ME TO GET DOWN
ON MY KNEES

23:06.083 --> 23:08.041
AND PRAY FOR A MIRACLE?

23:08.083 --> 23:10.792
YOU TELL ME
WHY I SHOULD DO THAT

23:10.834 --> 23:13.291
WHEN YOU BOTH KNOW
THERE'S ANOTHER OPTION.

23:13.333 --> 23:15.041
SAM...

23:15.083 --> 23:17.375
YOU NEED TO GET TESTED.

23:17.417 --> 23:18.917
IF YOU'RE A MATCH,

23:18.959 --> 23:22.959
YOU CAN SAVE
YOUR FATHER'S LIFE.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.667
(clears throat)

23:30.709 --> 23:33.208
SAM IS LEVEL-HEADED.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.583
SAM HAS A...

23:35.625 --> 23:38.041
AN ABOVE-AVERAGE
SENSE OF HUMOR.

23:38.083 --> 23:39.250
(chuckles)

23:39.291 --> 23:40.875
INTERESTING FACT, SAM--

23:40.917 --> 23:42.041
(woman)
FORGET THE CAMERA,

23:42.083 --> 23:44.291
LOSE THE CARDS,
AND JUST TALK.

23:44.333 --> 23:47.041
WHAT DO YOU THINK
WHEN YOU THINK OF SAM BENNETT?

23:47.083 --> 23:48.709
UH... (sighs)

23:48.750 --> 23:50.542
UH, HONESTY.

23:50.583 --> 23:52.417
CAN YOU ELABORATE?

23:52.458 --> 23:55.041
(sighs) WELL, THE...

23:55.083 --> 23:56.875
THE TRUTH MEANS A LOT TO SAM,

23:56.917 --> 23:59.750
MAYBE... MORE THAN
ANYTHING ELSE.

23:59.792 --> 24:02.875
AND, UM, THAT'S
AN ADMIRABLE QUALITY

24:02.917 --> 24:05.041
FOR A DOCTOR,
FOR ANYONE, REALLY.

24:05.083 --> 24:07.041
AND, UH...

24:07.083 --> 24:09.542
SAM HAS A RIGID SET
OF BELIEFS,

24:09.583 --> 24:12.041
AND HIS HONESTY--
THE HONESTY HE INSPIRES--

24:12.083 --> 24:14.834
ALLOWS HIM TO
STICK TO THOSE BELIEFS,

24:14.875 --> 24:16.750
AND I...

24:16.792 --> 24:19.709
I ADMIRE THAT ABOUT HIM.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.083
YOU KNOW, HIS PASSION TO HELP

24:21.125 --> 24:23.667
AND HIS PASSION FOR THE TRUTH.

24:23.709 --> 24:26.041
YEAH.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.625
YOU KNEW?

24:28.959 --> 24:31.917
THAT SAM IS YOUR SON

24:31.959 --> 24:36.041
OR THAT YOU'VE BEEN HAVING
AN AFFAIR FOR 40 YEARS?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.792
HOW WAS I GONNA SAY ANYTHING

24:37.834 --> 24:39.917
WHEN SHE GAVE YOU
SOMETHING I COULDN'T?

24:39.959 --> 24:42.875
JILLIAN, I'M SO SORRY.
I NEVER MEANT FOR IT TO--

24:42.917 --> 24:45.458
MEANT FOR--FOR IT TO HAPPEN,
TO HURT ME, WHAT?

24:45.500 --> 24:47.500
SAM. NO, SWEETIE.

24:47.542 --> 24:49.041
SWEETIE, LET... COME BACK.

24:49.083 --> 24:50.125
MOM.

24:50.166 --> 24:52.041
SW--JUST, SWEET--
COME HERE, SAM.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.917
I DON'T OWE YOU
ANY COURTESIES RIGHT NOW.
PLEASE.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.041
SAM.

24:55.083 --> 24:56.125
YOU LIED TO ME.

24:56.166 --> 24:58.291
WHAT'S THE RIGHT WAY
TO TELL YOUR CHILDREN

24:58.333 --> 25:01.750
THAT THEIR FATHER'S MARRIED
TO ANOTHER WOMAN?

25:01.792 --> 25:04.041
SAM.

25:04.083 --> 25:05.125
MOVE.

25:05.166 --> 25:06.750
MOVE!

25:06.792 --> 25:08.291
(pants)

25:08.333 --> 25:10.125
OKAY, T-T-TELL ME WHAT--

25:10.166 --> 25:11.750
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID.
W--

25:11.792 --> 25:14.000
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID
ABOUT MY FATHER.

25:14.041 --> 25:15.041
SAM--

25:15.083 --> 25:16.166
TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID!

25:16.208 --> 25:18.041
I-I SAID THAT--
THAT HE WALKED OUT ON US

25:18.083 --> 25:19.792
AND THAT I DIDN'T KNOW
WHERE HE WAS,

25:19.834 --> 25:21.542
AND IF HE WANTED TO BE HERE,
HE WOULD BE HERE.

25:21.583 --> 25:23.083
HE WOULD BE HERE.
YOU LIED.
W--

25:23.125 --> 25:24.959
NO! YOU LIED!

25:25.000 --> 25:29.000
I LIED. AS A PARENT,
YOU MAKE DECISIONS.

25:29.041 --> 25:31.041
WHY DID YOU EVEN
BRING HIM HERE?

25:31.083 --> 25:32.667
BECAUSE JILLIAN WANTED
THE BEST,

25:32.709 --> 25:35.208
AND--AND I COULDN'T TELL HER
WHY THAT WAS A BAD IDEA.

25:35.250 --> 25:37.041
YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HER HUSBAND,

25:37.083 --> 25:39.041
NOW YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT HER FEELINGS?

25:39.083 --> 25:41.625
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN GIVING ME
THE SAME CONSIDERATION.

25:41.667 --> 25:44.041
CLEARLY,
I HAVE MADE MISTAKES.

25:44.083 --> 25:46.458
THIS ISN'T
A PERFECT SITUATION,

25:46.500 --> 25:48.667
BUT, SAM, THERE'S
NO BAD PEOPLE HERE, JUST...

25:48.709 --> 25:51.041
AH!
JUST PEOPLE THAT MADE
BAD CHOICES.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.667
AND HE'S SUPPORTED US
WHEN WE NEEDED SUPPORT.

25:53.709 --> 25:56.041
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT DID YOU SAY?
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

25:56.083 --> 25:59.250
THERE WERE TIMES...

25:59.291 --> 26:01.375
YOU HAD YOUR HEART SET
ON GEORGETOWN--

26:01.417 --> 26:03.166
NO. NO.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.166
I NEVER ASKED ANYTHING
FROM ANYONE--

26:05.208 --> 26:06.875
NOT YOU,
ESPECIALLY NOT HIM.

26:06.917 --> 26:08.041
I'M SORRY.

26:08.083 --> 26:10.291
WILL YOU STOP SAYING
YOU'RE SORRY?!

26:10.333 --> 26:13.000
THAT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH...

26:13.041 --> 26:14.917
AND YOU KNOW IT.

26:14.959 --> 26:17.917
OH. GET OUT OF MY FACE.

26:17.959 --> 26:19.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

26:19.709 --> 26:20.875
(camera shatters)

26:24.083 --> 26:25.417
SAM AND I DIDN'T CARE MUCH FOR
ONE ANOTHER IN THE BEGINNING.

26:25.458 --> 26:26.625
I THOUGHT HE WAS ARROGANT,

26:26.667 --> 26:28.041
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS A BITCH.

26:28.083 --> 26:31.250
(chuckles) TURNS OUT ONLY ONE
OF THOSE THINGS IS TRUE.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.250
I LEARNED ALONG THE WAY
THAT IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE SAM,

26:34.291 --> 26:37.041
IT PROBABLY MEANT THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

26:37.083 --> 26:38.041
(chuckles)

26:38.083 --> 26:40.208
(Ben Folds Five's "Brick"
playing)

26:40.250 --> 26:41.834
(exhales) FOR 40 YEARS,

26:41.875 --> 26:43.500
HE, UH, HE WAS
MY MOTHER'S BOSS,

26:43.542 --> 26:46.417
AND... YOU KNOW,
I LIKED HIM, SURE.

26:46.458 --> 26:48.250
BUT NOW...

26:48.291 --> 26:50.500
BUT NOW HE'S
SUPPOSE TO HAVE SOME...

26:50.542 --> 26:53.041
SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE?

26:53.083 --> 26:54.750

IN THE BEGINNING,
I ASKED MYSELF THAT A LOT.

WHY... WAS I SLEEPING
WITH A MARRIED MAN?

28:39.083 --> 28:41.667
WHY DID I FALL IN LOVE
WITH HIM?

28:41.709 --> 28:43.667
WHY WON'T HE LEAVE HER?

28:43.709 --> 28:46.709
DO I WANT HIM TO?

28:49.458 --> 28:51.166
AFTER YOU WERE BORN,
I TOLD HIM

28:51.208 --> 28:53.083
THAT IF HE WANTED
TO BE IN YOUR LIFE,

28:53.125 --> 28:56.000
IT WAS GONNA BE
AS YOUR FATHER.

28:56.041 --> 28:59.291
WE HAD TO BE A FAMILY.

28:59.333 --> 29:02.041
BUT IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME
BACK THEN.

29:02.083 --> 29:06.041
DIVORCE WAS A BIG DEAL.

29:06.083 --> 29:09.041
EVEN IF YOU WERE CHEATING
ON YOUR WIFE,

29:09.083 --> 29:11.041
YOU STAYED.

29:11.083 --> 29:14.041
IT WAS THE NOBLE THING
TO DO.

29:14.083 --> 29:16.208
HE DID THE NOBLE THING.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.875
SO I MOVED ON.

29:19.917 --> 29:22.625
I STARTED SEEING
OTHER PEOPLE.

29:22.667 --> 29:27.792
BUT I NEVER
STOPPED THINKING ABOUT HIM...

29:30.166 --> 29:35.041
THE WAY HE WOULD LOOK AT ME
FROM ACROSS THE SHOP...

29:35.083 --> 29:37.333
THAT FEELING.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.750
AND THEN THERE WAS CORINNE.

29:43.792 --> 29:46.041
I HAD THIS FAMILY.

29:46.083 --> 29:48.458
IT WASN'T PERFECT
BY ANYBODY ELSE'S STANDARDS,

29:48.500 --> 29:50.875
BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL,

29:50.917 --> 29:53.500
SO BEAUTIFUL.

29:53.542 --> 29:56.041
I DON'T KNOW WHEN I...

29:56.083 --> 29:58.041
DECIDED HE WAS GONNA BE
THE ONLY MAN IN MY LIFE,

29:58.083 --> 30:01.333
BUT I MUST HAVE.

30:03.417 --> 30:06.083
AFTER A WHILE, YOU STOP
ASKING YOURSELF WHY

30:06.125 --> 30:11.709
BECAUSE THERE IS NO ANSWER
THAT MAKES SENSE.

30:11.750 --> 30:13.875
IT'S JUST...

30:13.917 --> 30:16.291
IT IS. IT'S...

30:16.333 --> 30:19.500
IT'S JUST THE LIFE
YOU HAVE.

30:23.709 --> 30:27.041
IT'S NOT FAIR.

30:27.083 --> 30:29.166
YOU MADE ALL THE SACRIFICES.

30:29.208 --> 30:32.709
NO, HE GAVE ME YOU
AND CORINNE,

30:32.750 --> 30:35.500
AND HE NEVER GOT TO LOVE
YOU GUYS THE WAY THAT I DID.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.041
THAT WAS HIS CHOICE.

30:37.083 --> 30:39.500
IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT WAS EASY.

30:39.542 --> 30:41.917

TO GO OVER TO RAYMOND'S

30:53.083 --> 30:56.000
FOR THOSE BARBECUES
ON MEMORIAL DAY?

30:57.875 --> 30:59.208
ONE TIME HE INTRODUCED YOU

30:59.250 --> 31:03.166
TO THIS FRIEND OF HIS
WHO WAS A DOCTOR.

31:03.208 --> 31:06.333
YOU ASKED HIM SO MANY QUESTIONS
THAT AT ONE POINT,

31:06.375 --> 31:09.208
HE LOCKED HIMSELF
IN THE BATHROOM.

31:10.417 --> 31:11.792
A FEW DAYS LATER,

31:11.834 --> 31:15.041
I GAVE YOU THAT YELLOW AND BLUE
TOY STETHOSCOPE.

31:15.083 --> 31:18.667
AND CORINNE HAD THE MOST
WELL-MONITORED HEART

31:18.709 --> 31:20.041
IN THE WORLD.

31:20.083 --> 31:22.041
(chuckles)

31:22.083 --> 31:25.000
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU THAT, SAM.

31:27.792 --> 31:31.709
EVERY TIME YOU PLAYED WITH IT,
I WANTED TO TELL YOU...

31:31.750 --> 31:33.458
(voice breaking)
WHERE IT WAS FROM.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.000
I'M SORRY.

31:36.041 --> 31:38.709

31:38.750 --> 31:41.750
BUT I AM SO SORRY.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.041

TO SHOOT THIS THING, SO--

YOUR CAMERA, BY THE WAY.

32:17.917 --> 32:19.041
DON'T SWEAT IT.

32:19.083 --> 32:21.417

ON EVERY SHOOT.

32:21.458 --> 32:23.208
DID YOU JUST GET A PHYSICAL?

32:23.250 --> 32:24.625
UH, NO.

32:24.667 --> 32:27.458

32:27.500 --> 32:28.875

GOT TESTED

32:33.458 --> 32:36.417

A DONOR FOR RAYMOND.

32:36.458 --> 32:39.041
HOW DID YOU COME
TO THAT DECISION?

32:39.083 --> 32:40.083
I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

32:40.125 --> 32:42.917
I CAME TO WORK
AND I GOT TESTED.

32:42.959 --> 32:45.625
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
IF YOU'RE A MATCH?

32:48.083 --> 32:50.000
I DON'T KNOW.

32:52.000 --> 32:53.792
I DON'T KNOW.

32:55.500 --> 32:57.750
(woman) WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

32:57.792 --> 32:59.250
THIS ISN'T ABOUT ME.

32:59.291 --> 33:02.583
SAM WAS THERE FOR ME
WHEN I REALLY JUST...

33:02.625 --> 33:06.041
NEEDED SOMEBODY
TO LET ME BREATHE.

33:06.083 --> 33:10.250
JARED WATSON, RACHEL ZUCKER,
ED DIAMANTI.

33:10.291 --> 33:12.041
WHO ARE THOSE PEOPLE?

33:12.083 --> 33:14.750
SAM SAVED THEM,
ALL OF THEM.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.125
NOT TO MENTION THE NINE MONTHS

33:16.166 --> 33:17.959
THAT HE WAS ABLE TO GIVE
PETE WILDER.

33:18.000 --> 33:21.000
I MEAN, I'M SURE THAT SAM
SIGNED UP FOR ALL OF THIS

33:21.041 --> 33:24.208
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT, DEEP DOWN,
THAT HE WAS DOING GOOD.

33:24.250 --> 33:26.625
AND I'M SURE THAT
YOU ALL ARE SALIVATING

33:26.667 --> 33:30.166
BECAUSE HIS LIFE WENT FROM OPRAH
TO SPRINGER OVERNIGHT, BUT...

33:30.208 --> 33:32.625
SAM'S A GREAT DOCTOR.

33:32.667 --> 33:34.041
AND HE HAS SPENT
HIS ENTIRE CAREER

33:34.083 --> 33:35.375
BUILDING A REPUTATION.

33:35.417 --> 33:37.125
HE DOES NOT DESERVE
TO LOSE THAT

33:37.166 --> 33:38.959
WHEN ALL HE DID
WAS GET BLINDSIDED

33:39.000 --> 33:41.041
BY A TRUCKLOAD OF SUCK.

33:41.083 --> 33:43.125
HE DESERVES BETTER.

33:43.166 --> 33:46.166
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW THAT.

33:46.208 --> 33:49.208
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

34:06.375 --> 34:09.041
(sighs)

34:09.083 --> 34:12.041

34:12.083 --> 34:16.041
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THE MAN THAT I'VE BECOME.

34:16.083 --> 34:18.709

AT NIGHT

34:18.750 --> 34:21.000

34:21.041 --> 34:22.166

34:22.208 --> 34:26.041
I AM WHO I AM
BECAUSE OF MY MOTHER.

34:26.083 --> 34:29.250
SHE RAISED A DOCTOR,
A FATHER,

34:29.291 --> 34:31.917
A GRANDFATHER,

34:31.959 --> 34:34.041
A BROTHER WHO WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR HIS SISTER.

34:34.083 --> 34:36.667
MY MOTHER RAISED A MAN...

34:36.709 --> 34:38.667
A REAL MAN.

34:38.709 --> 34:40.917
SO...

34:40.959 --> 34:43.291
I WOULD BE HERE
WITHOUT YOU.

34:46.625 --> 34:48.417
I GOT TESTED.

34:48.458 --> 34:49.667
I'M A MATCH.

34:49.709 --> 34:53.917
AND I COULD DONATE
PART OF MY LOBE TO YOU

34:53.959 --> 34:56.750
AND I WILL
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT,

34:56.792 --> 34:58.750
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW LITTLE
I KNOW YOU,

34:58.792 --> 35:02.333
THAT'S THE KIND OF MAN
MY MOTHER RAISED.

35:04.959 --> 35:06.667
(sighs)

35:06.709 --> 35:09.000
(chuckles)

35:11.500 --> 35:14.458
YOU WERE SO EXCITED
WHEN YOU GOT THE LEAD

35:14.500 --> 35:17.041
IN THAT FOURTH GRADE PLAY.

35:20.083 --> 35:22.041
DEE DIDN'T WANT ME TO COME,
BUT I SNUCK IN ANYWAY,

35:22.083 --> 35:23.709
AND I STOOD IN THE BACK

35:23.750 --> 35:26.000
AND I JUST SMILED.

35:28.083 --> 35:30.041
IT WAS HARD NOT TO...

35:30.083 --> 35:33.291
CHEER OR WAVE.

35:33.333 --> 35:34.917
HARD NOT TO LET ANYBODY KNOW

35:34.959 --> 35:39.166
WHY I WAS JUST
STANDING THERE... SMILING.

35:42.625 --> 35:46.291
I SAW DEE
ON THE FRONT ROW WITH CORINNE,

35:46.333 --> 35:48.083
AND I WONDERED
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE

35:48.125 --> 35:53.333
IF MY PLACE IN LIFE WAS SITTING
NEXT TO THEM WATCHING YOU.

35:53.375 --> 35:57.417
BUT THAT'S...
NOT THE LIFE I CHOSE.

36:01.083 --> 36:03.750

FOR SYMPATHY.

36:03.792 --> 36:08.542

A PIECE OF YOURSELF TO SAVE ME.

TO BE...

36:22.000 --> 36:25.208

36:27.667 --> 36:30.041

36:32.083 --> 36:34.583
I SHOULD GO HOME.

36:40.709 --> 36:43.000

36:43.041 --> 36:44.166

36:45.625 --> 36:47.041
HEY.

36:47.083 --> 36:50.000
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE

36:50.041 --> 36:51.458
FOR RAYMOND.

36:51.500 --> 36:54.041
AND I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE.

36:54.083 --> 36:55.208
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
APOLOGIZE TO ME.

36:55.250 --> 36:58.542
OH, I PUT YOU ON THE SPOT.
I ASKED YOU TO GET TESTED.

36:58.583 --> 36:59.959
I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.041
NO, YOU WERE JUST TRYING
TO SAVE YOUR HUSBAND.

37:02.083 --> 37:05.041
I AM NOT
THE ONLY VICTIM HERE.

37:05.083 --> 37:07.041
(exhales)

37:07.083 --> 37:09.834
UM...

37:09.875 --> 37:12.709
I MADE THE CHOICE
TO STAY.

37:12.750 --> 37:15.709
I MADE THE CHOICE
TO NOT HATE DEE.

37:15.750 --> 37:19.125
I MADE THE CHOICE
NOT TO LOSE MY HUSBAND.

37:21.041 --> 37:24.458
THAT MIGHT MAKE ME A FOOL,
BUT...

37:24.500 --> 37:26.250
I'M NOT A VICTIM.

37:28.083 --> 37:31.000
I'M GONNA BE
TAKING RAYMOND HOME.

37:36.625 --> 37:38.834
(Violet) HEY, LISTEN,

37:38.875 --> 37:41.041
I-I KNOW THIS IS SAM'S THING,
BUT, UH, I-I WAS WONDERING

37:41.083 --> 37:45.041
IF YOU HAD ANY CONTACTS
WITH ANY NATIONAL NEWS PROGRAMS.

37:45.083 --> 37:47.750
IT'S, UH, IT--IT'S--
IT'S SARAH.

37:47.792 --> 37:50.041
WE--WE GOT A-A TON
OF LOCAL COVERAGE,

37:50.083 --> 37:52.500
BUT IT'S STARTING TO WANE,
AND THAT--THAT SUCKS.

37:52.542 --> 37:54.500
THE COMMUNITY IS LOSING STEAM,

37:54.542 --> 37:56.291
AND I THOUGHT MAKING THIS
A NATIONAL STORY

37:56.333 --> 37:58.542
WOULD GIVE US THE--THE BOOST
WE NEED.

37:58.583 --> 38:01.583
(woman)
I'LL MAKE A FEW CALLS.

38:01.625 --> 38:03.917
YOU'RE REALLY INVESTED
IN THIS CASE.

38:03.959 --> 38:06.041
WELL, HOW COULD I NOT BE?

38:06.083 --> 38:08.750
I MEAN, RON AND DANA, THEIR--
THEIR LITTLE GIRL IS MISSING.

38:08.792 --> 38:13.125
I'M WITH THEM EVERY DAY.
I SEE WHAT IT'S DOING TO THEM.

38:13.166 --> 38:16.792
WE SAW YOU
IN YOUR HUSBAND'S OFFICE.

38:19.125 --> 38:20.709
W-- (chuckles)

38:20.750 --> 38:23.542
I EAT BREAKFAST THERE.

38:23.583 --> 38:26.792
NOT ALL THE TIME.
JUST WHEN I NEED...

38:28.291 --> 38:31.875
PETE HAD THIS... FAVORITE SET
OF SHEETS THAT I HATED,

38:31.917 --> 38:35.667
AND NOW I CAN'T SLEEP
WITHOUT THEM. (chuckles)

38:35.709 --> 38:38.458
I WEAR HIS SWEATER AT HOME.

38:38.500 --> 38:40.041
I MEAN,
I'D WEAR IT ALL THE TIME

38:40.083 --> 38:41.500
EXCEPT I'M AFRAID
THAT PEOPLE WOULD THINK

38:41.542 --> 38:45.500
I WAS THE FREAK WHO WEARS
HER DEAD HUSBAND'S CLOTHES.

38:47.083 --> 38:48.166
(sighs)

38:48.208 --> 38:50.041
I KNOW THAT PETE
IS NOT COMING BACK.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.959
I KNOW THAT EVERY DAY...

38:53.000 --> 38:55.291
I AM GETTING CLOSER TO KNOWING
WHO I AM WITHOUT HIM.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.375
BUT RON AND DANA, THEY'RE--

38:57.417 --> 38:59.834
I MEAN,
THEY'RE--THEY'RE STUCK.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.917
THEY'RE STUCK IN THIS PLACE
WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW.

39:01.959 --> 39:07.041
AND THEY CAN'T MOVE FORWARD
UNTIL THEY DO.

39:07.083 --> 39:09.500
DO YOU THINK SARAH
IS ALIVE?

HOW DID YOU SLEEP LAST NIGHT?

40:27.291 --> 40:28.917
UH, I DIDN'T.

40:28.959 --> 40:31.041
WHY NOT?

40:31.083 --> 40:33.000
ARE YOU FOR REAL?

40:35.667 --> 40:38.041
WHY IS IT THAT
WHENEVER YOU CAN'T SLEEP

40:38.083 --> 40:41.041
YOU ALWAYS MANAGE
TO COME ACROSS THESE CHANNELS

40:41.083 --> 40:44.041
THAT YOU NEVER KNEW EXISTED?

40:44.083 --> 40:47.750
I WAS WATCHING THIS SHOW
LAST NIGHT ABOUT THIS GUY

40:47.792 --> 40:51.667
THAT GETS DROPPED IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE SAHARA,

40:51.709 --> 40:54.041
AND ALL THEY LEAVE HIM WITH
IS, UH,

40:54.083 --> 40:58.750
LIKE, SOME ROPE, SOME FLINT,
AND SOME KIDNEY BEANS

40:58.792 --> 41:00.375
OR WHATEVER.

41:00.417 --> 41:02.208
AND, UH...

41:02.250 --> 41:05.291
AND HE HAS TO SURVIVE.

41:05.333 --> 41:08.000
AND I'M WATCHING THIS SHOW,
AND--AND I'M THINKING,

41:08.041 --> 41:09.458
AH...

41:09.500 --> 41:12.917
JUST HOW COOL
THAT MUST BE...

41:12.959 --> 41:14.083
TO HAVE TO DO THAT,

41:14.125 --> 41:16.583
TO--TO JUST LOSE YOURSELF.

41:19.583 --> 41:22.750
YOU KNOW
I'VE NEVER LEFT THE COUNTRY?

41:22.792 --> 41:26.041
NEVER SURPRISED ANYONE.

41:26.083 --> 41:28.041
I HAVEN'T FOUND MY ONE YET.

41:28.083 --> 41:31.792
I MEAN, I'M NOT SURE
I'VE REALLY TRIED.

41:31.834 --> 41:35.041
AND I MEAN, LIKE,
REALLY, REALLY TRIED...

41:35.083 --> 41:37.041
YOU KNOW?

41:37.083 --> 41:40.834
MY IDENTITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN
MY KID,

41:40.875 --> 41:43.041
MY GRANDKID,

41:43.083 --> 41:46.041
MY MOTHER, CORINNE,

41:46.083 --> 41:49.083
AND MY FRIENDS.

41:49.125 --> 41:52.709
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN ENOUGH
UP UNTIL NOW.

41:52.750 --> 41:55.125
BUT...

41:55.166 --> 41:58.500
WHAT'S NEXT?

41:58.542 --> 42:00.375
I MEAN, I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE THIS THING,

42:00.417 --> 42:05.125
YOU KNOW, THIS SHOW, NET--
NETWORK PILOT THING.

42:05.166 --> 42:08.250
I THOUGHT THAT WAS...

42:08.291 --> 42:12.041
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR,
BUT...

42:12.083 --> 42:14.000
I DON'T KNOW.

42:16.875 --> 42:18.792
I DON'T REALLY KNOW...

42:18.834 --> 42:22.166
WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.
