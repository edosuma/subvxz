KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:05.473 --> 00:08.509
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.542 --> 00:10.544
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.578 --> 00:12.513
and by the time I got here,

00:12.546 --> 00:16.016
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.819
I hid who I really was

00:18.852 --> 00:23.257
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:23.291 --> 00:26.527
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:26.560 --> 00:29.797
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.830 --> 00:31.699
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.732 --> 00:34.034
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.703 --> 00:38.439
I am Supergirl.

00:39.507 --> 00:41.575
Previously on Supergirl...

00:41.609 --> 00:43.844
We salvaged you
and resurrected you.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.579
And who are you?

00:45.613 --> 00:47.581
I'm a member
of an organization
called Cadmus.

00:47.615 --> 00:48.749
Thanks for stopping by, Mom.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.119
And I called the police.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.323
I'm not so sure
we're a good match.

00:55.356 --> 00:56.724
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, no.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.692
I'm just glad
we're on the same page,
you know.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.760
Okay, good.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.872
Checkmate.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.707
Very good.

01:13.741 --> 01:16.477
Now let's see how
you defend against
the Alekhine Variation.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.155
Lionel?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.391
Keep setting up.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.230
I thought
we had discussed this.

01:36.264 --> 01:38.699
We did.
And this is what we're doing.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.202
Lena.

01:41.235 --> 01:43.171
This is
your new mother.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.343
I'm Lex.

01:49.377 --> 01:50.411
I'm going to be
your new brother.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.146
Wanna play?

01:58.686 --> 01:59.587
Thank you.

02:02.823 --> 02:06.627
I think having a sister
will be good for Lex.

NEWSCASTER ON TV:
The trial of Lillian Luthor
continued today.

02:09.797 --> 02:14.502
Luthor, the suspected head
of the anti-alien terrorist
organization, Cadmus,

02:14.535 --> 02:16.670
has been charged
with a host of crimes,

02:16.704 --> 02:19.173
including the use
of a bio-weapon

02:19.207 --> 02:22.576
in an attempted
extermination of all aliens
in National City.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.445
That woman is bad news.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.813
NEWSCASTER: Luthor claims
that she is a victim...

02:25.846 --> 02:27.781
I hope once she's
convicted, they, uh...

02:27.815 --> 02:29.717
They put her out
on the town square
for public shaming.

02:29.750 --> 02:31.952
On Daxam,
it really seemed
to cut back on recidivism.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.523
Uh, well,
that kind of punishment
actually went away

02:35.556 --> 02:36.657
a long time ago.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.326
That's too bad.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.693
Yeah, I haven't, uh...
Haven't seen you in a while.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.662
I've... I've been busy.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.498
-Yeah?
-Just chasing bad guys.
(CHUCKLES)

02:47.768 --> 02:48.836
Uh, how are you?

02:48.869 --> 02:50.538
-How's Eve?
-Oh, great.

02:50.571 --> 02:53.407
Great, we are...
We're great.
Eve is great.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.576
-Things are great.
-I'm so happy for you.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.279
-More drinks for you guys?
-Yeah, please, I would...
We would love...

02:58.312 --> 02:59.347
Yup. Um, yup.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.586
Another round's on its way.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.857
-You okay, J'onn?
-Yeah, yeah.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.494
It's just the first time
I've been in this bar
since, uh...

03:14.362 --> 03:16.364
M'gann left.

03:16.397 --> 03:20.501
Hey, I'm...
I am very excited to meet
Alex's new mystery man.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.836
Hey, do we know what, um,
what he does for a living?

03:22.870 --> 03:24.338
Alex's guy?

03:24.372 --> 03:25.506
Cop.

03:25.539 --> 03:27.308
-Oh!
-Yeah, no way Alex Danvers

03:27.341 --> 03:28.842
dates someone
who doesn't own a firearm.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.378
Hey, you guys.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.680
Hey, um...
You all remember Maggie,
right?

03:34.482 --> 03:36.617
Hey, yeah.
Good to see you again.

03:36.650 --> 03:39.653
Alex! (CHUCKLES) I...
I didn't know.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.622
-Did you know?
-Yes, I knew, I'm psychic.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.357
How come you
never said anything before?

03:43.391 --> 03:44.492
It's not for me to say.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.594
Good for you, Alex.

03:46.627 --> 03:47.661
Yeah.

03:47.695 --> 03:48.729
Drinks up!

03:48.762 --> 03:50.631
Hey!

03:50.664 --> 03:53.634
-Here we go,
bubbly club soda for the lady.
-Thank you.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.902
And for you, sir. Right.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.604
-Hi.
-Hey, hi.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.038
-What's up?
-Um, well, I just wanted
to let you know

03:58.071 --> 03:59.640
that Maggie and I are dating.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.909
Oh, that was the thing. Okay.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.477
Okay, that's...

04:03.511 --> 04:05.746
Is that like a problem
here on Earth or...

04:05.779 --> 04:08.782
Well, on Earth, you know,
not everybody supports
ladies loving ladies.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.051
Oh, on Daxam
it's the more the merrier.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.520
Oh, okay.

04:12.553 --> 04:13.921
-Drinks for you guys? Awesome.
-Yeah.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.523
Hey, do you play pool?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.025
-Yeah.
-No, you don't.

04:18.058 --> 04:21.495
-What?
-It is geometry with sticks,
folks.

04:21.529 --> 04:23.631
Pool is easy.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.832
Let's go do it.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.536
JAMES: Alex.
ALEX: Yeah?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.070
Congrats.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.672

-Yeah.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.074

against Luthor is
her adopted daughter...

to have to do.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.822
Well, the Luthors
have never shied away
from doing awful things.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.459
Yeah, but she's not like them.

04:51.492 --> 04:53.394
She knows Lillian is evil,

04:53.427 --> 04:54.795
she's doing the right thing,

04:54.828 --> 04:56.364
even though she still
loves her mother.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.433
What she did was brave.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.469
If you say so.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.538
I should go see her.
She could probably
use a friend.

05:04.572 --> 05:07.475
Using her friends,
that's exactly what
I'm worried about.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.077
Whoa!

05:10.110 --> 05:11.311
-(GLASS SHATTERS)

NEWSCASTER ON TV:
Lillian Luthor's
defense attorneys

05:15.749 --> 05:18.452
tried to downplay
Lena Luthor's testimony,

05:18.486 --> 05:20.721
characterizing
her statements as

05:20.754 --> 05:23.457
"the angry rant
of an estranged daughter."

05:27.761 --> 05:30.964
Everyone in National City
has got an opinion about me.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.600
Ungrateful daughter,

05:32.633 --> 05:33.834
heroine, bitch.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.102
Ugh.

05:35.135 --> 05:37.471
And they've all
called for a quote.

05:37.505 --> 05:38.706
Not you though,
Snapper Carr hasn't sent
you here to shake me down.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.908
No, no. I'm here as a friend.

05:40.941 --> 05:43.611
I thought you could use some
fried sugary goodness
in your life.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.878
You eat donuts, right?

05:44.912 --> 05:45.913

-(LAUGHS)

05:49.182 --> 05:50.418
Thank you, Kara.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.786
So, was it awful?

05:52.820 --> 05:55.022
It actually
felt good to testify.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.126
I got to say my piece
and finally distance myself
from the Luthor name.

05:59.159 --> 06:03.531
And then I came back here
to 12 calls from her lawyers.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.399
Yeah, she wants to see me.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.934
What do you think she wants?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.069
Probably to tell me
that my outfit in court
was horrible

06:09.102 --> 06:10.504
and that I need a makeover.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.608
I don't know and I don't care.

06:14.642 --> 06:17.177
I just thought
I was done with her,
you know...

06:17.210 --> 06:20.514
I'd finally shut the door
on being a Luthor.

06:20.548 --> 06:23.617
And then there she was,
back on my phone sheet.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.019
Twelve times.

06:26.053 --> 06:29.490
You don't think I should
feel guilty for not wanting
to go see that monster, right?

06:29.523 --> 06:31.525
Well, do you think
you would find peace of mind

06:31.559 --> 06:33.627
by visiting her
and telling her
how you really feel?

06:33.661 --> 06:35.463
Even if I did,
it wouldn't make a difference.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.831
You know...

06:37.865 --> 06:41.802
She's been the same way
since the day I met her.

06:41.835 --> 06:45.439
I've spent most of my life
wishing I could talk to people
that are no longer here.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.710
She's still here.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.112

the guard back and go.

No.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.681
I'm sorry.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.850
I promised myself
I would be better.

07:30.984 --> 07:32.019
Please sit.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.059
Old habits die hard.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.965
I don't want to fight.

07:44.998 --> 07:49.570
I asked you here
because I wanted to let
you know that I forgive you.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.839
That I still love you.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.641
The only time you ever tell me
you love me is when you
need something from me.

07:53.674 --> 07:56.043
I know I wasn't
the greatest mother,

07:56.076 --> 07:57.645
but I did
the best that I could.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.747
By making me feel unwanted.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.883
-Like an outsider.
-You don't want to believe it,

08:02.916 --> 08:04.852
but I always tried
to protect you.

08:04.885 --> 08:06.286
If Dad could hear you now.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.121
After all the things
you've done and justified.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.725
You hold Lionel up
as some saint,
but he's not.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.594
Don't disparage him.
He was a good man.

08:13.627 --> 08:15.996
If he was a good man,
he would've told
you the truth.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.298
But he hated me
too much to do that.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.100
Told me the truth about what?

08:23.637 --> 08:26.640
When your father
and I first got together,

08:26.674 --> 08:29.042
it was the happiest time
of my life.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.814
But after Lex was born,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.182
Lionel started having...

08:36.183 --> 08:37.685
...an affair.

08:37.718 --> 08:40.554
I was clueless,

08:40.588 --> 08:43.290
until I went to surprise him
on a business trip,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.593
only to find that he was
with your mother.

08:47.728 --> 08:48.796
My mother?

08:50.363 --> 08:52.733
She was already pregnant
with you by then.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.570
They paid her off.

08:56.604 --> 08:59.940
Your father
came back to try
and rebuild our marriage.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.810
Then when you were four,

09:02.843 --> 09:05.679
we heard your mother
had died.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.782
The state was going
to put you in foster care.

09:08.816 --> 09:12.686
Your father brought you home
and we adopted you.

09:12.720 --> 09:14.855
But he didn't like me
spending time with you.

09:16.223 --> 09:18.726
I think it made him
remember what he'd done.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.128
He felt guilty.

09:21.161 --> 09:22.630
He'd lash out.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.835
So, I stayed away.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.570
Gravitated to Lex.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.740
To protect myself.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.108
And you.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.710
But seeing you with him...

09:39.246 --> 09:42.115
You look so much like her.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.753
It was like ripping
a Band-Aid off
every day of my life.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.124
So, I really am a Luthor.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.260
We're the only two
Luthors left.

09:55.328 --> 09:57.264
And we need
to be there for each other.

saved you,

did she order you
to work for Cadmus?

She didn't have to
order me to do anything.

I hate him.

11:16.944 --> 11:19.179
He literally has no heart.

11:19.212 --> 11:22.182
And what, if anything,
did Lillian Luthor tell you
about the Medusa Project?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.785

our safety and way of life,

11:27.120 --> 11:30.724

11:30.758 --> 11:32.225
She wanted
to save the human race.

11:32.259 --> 11:34.795
-That's enough, thank you.
-It is not enough!

11:34.828 --> 11:36.830
Lillian Luthor
is not a criminal.

back into custody

14:02.142 --> 14:03.410
I know, I know. It's just...

14:03.443 --> 14:04.945
I can't figure out

14:04.978 --> 14:06.513
where he got
all that Kryptonite.

14:06.546 --> 14:09.382
Clark was supposed
to have taken all of it.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.219
-What's wrong?
-I had the jail check
all of Corben's visitors

14:12.252 --> 14:14.955
to see how the Kryptonite
might have gotten smuggled in.

14:14.988 --> 14:17.657
But he hasn't
had any visitors
since he's been there.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.560
And when they swept
his cell yesterday there was
nothing out of the ordinary.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.097
Which means
he must have gotten
the Kryptonite last night.

14:24.131 --> 14:25.632
That seems
to narrow down the window.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.400
Why do you look
so concerned?

14:27.434 --> 14:29.302
Because there was
only one visitor
to the jail last night,

14:30.437 --> 14:32.439
but it was
to visit Lillian Luthor.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.606
Who?

14:34.942 --> 14:36.043
Her daughter, Lena.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.547
You know I was at the jail
to see my mother last night.

-You're the one
that told me to go.
-I know.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.151
It's just...

People are losing it
because of your
mother's escape.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.289
And I wanted you to know
so that you could be prepared.

14:52.025 --> 14:53.560
Okay, so...

14:53.593 --> 14:55.328
Tell me.
What are people saying?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.200
That you may have
also visited Metallo.

15:03.070 --> 15:04.504
And you think that's
something I would do.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.941
I...

15:07.975 --> 15:10.143
You know,
Kara, you are starting
to sound a lot like a reporter

15:10.177 --> 15:11.278
and not a friend right now.

15:11.311 --> 15:13.546
I don't mean to.

-No, we didn't.

15:27.727 --> 15:31.098

some surveillance footage
I wanted to ask you about.

already. This is for you.

16:18.111 --> 16:19.546
Wait, you're putting
Lena Luthor on the cover?

16:19.579 --> 16:22.082
She doesn't need
to be a front-page story.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.651
She's arguably
the most famous name
in National City, Danvers.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.486

in prison.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.221
Of course I'm putting her
on the cover, she's a Luthor.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.290
But she didn't do it.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.125
Have you seen the video?

confirmation bias now?

16:37.164 --> 16:39.132

she didn't do it.

She said, she said.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.236

more than just a quote.

think she's guilty already.

she's guilty today.

The only thing
Lena has done is help.

She called the police
on her own mother
over the Medusa virus.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.724
That's exactly my point.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.559
If she can betray
her own mother,

17:39.592 --> 17:42.429
what is to stop
her from pulling
a long con on you?

17:42.462 --> 17:44.731
Okay, I know
she's your friend, Kara,
but Lena's bad news.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.166
Why, because she's a Luthor?

17:46.199 --> 17:48.301
No, because she's guilty.

I thought you two
were going out.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.480
You mean, went out.

18:33.513 --> 18:38.218
Uh, he's so dreamy

18:38.251 --> 18:39.686

the worst date of my life.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.656

Did he look at other women
the entire night?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.825
No.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.895
Oh, did he chew
with his mouth open and tell
those inappropriate jokes?

18:48.928 --> 18:53.900
No, all he did was talk
about you the entire date.

18:53.933 --> 18:55.134
(SNICKERS)

18:55.835 --> 18:57.770

I said you have
to get over your ex-girlfriend

before you put yourself
back out in the field.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.510

No, no, no, no.

19:03.543 --> 19:06.246

Hello, Ms. Luthor.

20:57.657 --> 20:58.791
Sorry for the delay.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.930
Metallo's strong,
but something's off.

21:05.665 --> 21:06.933
His Kryptonite isn't right.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.702
I think it's hurting him.

21:09.736 --> 21:12.639
Well, you're lucky you
didn't take a direct hit.

21:12.672 --> 21:13.673
Very lucky.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.443
I had my shield.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.677
I love that shield.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.847
And I know
what I'm doing, Kara.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.815
Even if Metallo's weakening,
though,

21:22.849 --> 21:25.385
he still is a fanatic follower
of Lillian Luthor.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.654
We have to find out where
he's taken Lena, and help her.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.390
What is it going
to take for you to realize
that Lena is a criminal?

21:30.423 --> 21:32.525
She's not the victim.
She got the Kryptonite.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.961
-He broke her out of prison.
-Lena's not
a member of Cadmus!

21:35.962 --> 21:37.296
She's not!

21:40.567 --> 21:42.935
She stopped the gang
with alien weapons.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.538
She saved Alex's life
when Corben tried to kill her.

21:45.572 --> 21:48.941
She shot Corben
and then her crazy mom
turned Corben into Metallo.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.444
So, that could have been
the plan the entire time.

21:51.478 --> 21:54.347
We have to start treating
Lena Luthor like a hostile.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.948

is too overwhelming.

22:01.788 --> 22:03.423
I did.
It's... It's clean.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.892
Then find something
to prove her innocent.

22:05.925 --> 22:09.061
Everything we've seen so far
says the exact opposite.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.466
Well, she's my friend.

22:14.467 --> 22:15.868
And I believe in her.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.110
I'm your friend.

22:24.143 --> 22:27.714
Which is why
I don't understand why it's
so hard for you to believe me.

22:27.747 --> 22:29.582
People don't
remember this, Kara,

22:29.616 --> 22:31.751
but Clark and Lex Luthor
used to be best friends.

22:31.784 --> 22:33.386
For years.

22:33.420 --> 22:37.156
And Clark believed
in Lex for the longest time.

22:37.189 --> 22:41.027
No matter what people said,
no matter what kind of proof
he saw with his own eyes.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.897
No, Lex was his friend.

22:47.099 --> 22:48.635
-But Clark was wrong.
-Lena is not Lex.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.803
But they grew up
in the same house, Kara.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.139
I don't understand
why you keep defending her.

22:53.172 --> 22:55.608
And you have
so much faith in her,
but none in me, as Guardian.

22:55.642 --> 22:57.009
That's entirely different.

22:57.043 --> 22:58.545
I am trying to protect you.

22:58.578 --> 23:00.680
I do not need your protection.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.051
I need your trust.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.888
You have mine.

23:08.921 --> 23:11.057
I don't understand why it's
so hard for me to get yours.

23:11.958 --> 23:12.959

23:18.798 --> 23:19.799
(KARA GRUNTS)

23:30.109 --> 23:31.544
(CONTINUES GRUNTING)

23:39.085 --> 23:40.653
That was good.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.055
Is there a technique
to that or were you just

23:43.089 --> 23:45.925
giving it a swift kick
in the caboose?

23:45.958 --> 23:48.595
Because if there's
a technique, I wanna know it.

23:48.628 --> 23:51.531
(CHUCKLES) I've missed
training with you.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.466
-Yeah, I've just been...
-Busy.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.701
I get it.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.803
Chasing bad guys.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.205
And with what's
going on with Lena
I'm sure it's...

23:59.238 --> 24:01.674
I'm sure it's extra busy.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.676
Are you going to tell me
not to believe in her?

24:03.710 --> 24:05.545
You believe
in a lot of people
that others don't.

24:05.578 --> 24:07.847
Oh, did you talk to James?

24:07.880 --> 24:11.551
No, I'm actually talking
about myself.

24:11.584 --> 24:13.586
You know,
you believing in me,
it meant a lot.

24:16.022 --> 24:19.726
You're right.
I have been cold.

24:19.759 --> 24:20.960
-And distant.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.262
And I'd like
to apologize for that.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.699
Hey, I'm just glad to know
that it's not me adjusting
to Earth's chilly climate.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.001
I was mad at you,
because I thought
you were dating Eve.

24:30.269 --> 24:31.470
(EXHALES)

24:32.038 --> 24:33.139
Ah.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.110
"Were," as in past tense.

24:38.144 --> 24:41.981
Right? As in,
she told you that the date
didn't actually go well.

24:42.014 --> 24:43.850
Uh, she mentioned it.

24:43.883 --> 24:44.884
Yeah.

24:48.621 --> 24:52.258
You know,
I'm not super hip
on earthly social cues,

24:52.291 --> 24:55.595
but why would you be mad
if I was dating Eve?

24:55.628 --> 24:56.863
(SCOFFS) I'm not mad.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.865
You literally just said
you were mad.

24:58.898 --> 25:01.601
-No.
-Two seconds ago, you said,
"I am mad about..."

25:01.634 --> 25:03.736
Yeah, I'm surprised.

25:03.770 --> 25:06.272
-Oh, not mad, surprised.
-I'm surprised that...

25:06.305 --> 25:09.609
You'd just date someone else,

25:09.642 --> 25:12.278
when you were
serious about me,
because I mean if...

25:12.311 --> 25:14.013
How could you
be serious if you did that?

25:14.046 --> 25:17.650
If you don't like me,
why do you... Why do you care?

25:20.920 --> 25:23.155
I'm gonna go check
and see if they've found Lena.

25:23.189 --> 25:24.857
(KARA CLEARS THROAT)

25:36.002 --> 25:38.104
-Are you okay?
-Don't.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.641
You're still angry
I had Metallo liberate you
from that jail?

25:41.674 --> 25:43.042
It makes me look
more guilty when I'm not.

25:43.075 --> 25:45.945
Even if they found out
the truth about you,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.814
no one would
change their mind.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.249
(CHUCKLES)

25:50.282 --> 25:53.653
The public wants
to believe the narrative
they expect from us.

25:53.686 --> 25:55.221
That Luthors are evil.

25:56.689 --> 25:58.224
We don't get second chances.

25:59.692 --> 26:01.661
Look what they did to me.

26:01.694 --> 26:03.195
Stripped me
of my medical license

26:03.229 --> 26:05.665
without even a hearing.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.033
Or worse,
what they did to Lex.

26:08.701 --> 26:12.805
He could've fixed
this planet for generations.

26:12.839 --> 26:16.943
But Superman twisted
what he was doing,
and they all turned on him.

26:16.976 --> 26:18.577
Lex went insane.

26:19.846 --> 26:21.681
Exactly.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.283
And if they could take
the brightest mind on Earth

26:24.316 --> 26:27.119
and drive him
crazy defending himself,

26:27.153 --> 26:29.155
imagine what they
could do to you.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.090
Stop the van.
I'm going back!

26:31.123 --> 26:32.992
To what?

26:33.025 --> 26:35.361
You have
no life anymore, Lena.

26:35.394 --> 26:37.329
You have no one on your side.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.367
You're guilty, just like me.

26:41.400 --> 26:43.736
You're on the run,
just like me.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.375
Join Cadmus.

26:49.408 --> 26:52.879
And together we can
do all the great things
you ever dreamed of.

26:54.413 --> 26:57.083
And with no Luthor men
to divide us,

26:59.151 --> 27:01.620
I can finally be
the mother you always wanted.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.157
Because I do love you.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.295
Let me prove it to you now.

27:29.782 --> 27:30.917
(BEEPING)

27:58.811 --> 27:59.946
What is this place?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.782
One of Lex's facilities.

28:02.815 --> 28:05.184
A giant satellite receiver
embedded in the top
of this mountain

28:05.217 --> 28:08.855
monitors outer space
for signs of intelligent life.

28:08.888 --> 28:09.922
To warn of alien invasion?

28:09.956 --> 28:10.990
Bingo!

28:11.023 --> 28:12.324
Because we know
more are coming.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.460
Which makes me glad
I joined the cause.

28:14.493 --> 28:17.363
There's enough here
to sustain us
for a long time if we need it,

28:17.396 --> 28:18.865
but I suspect we won't.

28:18.898 --> 28:20.366
Why not?

28:20.399 --> 28:22.101
We're fugitives,
we can't go back.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.970
Not yet.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.505
But your brother
didn't only keep rations
for times of emergency.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.008
He also kept an arsenal.

28:29.041 --> 28:32.945
Vaults around the world
loaded with all the things
he'd collected to level

28:32.979 --> 28:36.482
the playing field and defeat
Superman once and for all.

28:36.515 --> 28:40.753
And one of those vaults
is right here.

Ready for authorization.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.722
All we need

28:44.323 --> 28:45.324
is to open it.

28:46.793 --> 28:47.794
It's a biometric lock.

28:48.527 --> 28:50.229
It scans for Luthor DNA.

28:50.262 --> 28:52.264
Tell me you don't have
a bit of Lex frozen somewhere.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.900
I didn't say Lex's DNA.

28:53.933 --> 28:55.234
I said Luthor.

28:55.267 --> 28:57.269
Any Luthor can open it.

28:57.303 --> 29:01.373
And you, my daughter,
are part of that family tree.

29:01.407 --> 29:03.843
You didn't have
your green goon
liberate me from prison

29:03.876 --> 29:05.845
because you loved me.

29:05.878 --> 29:09.015
Because you
wanted to help me.

29:09.048 --> 29:11.417
You did it
because I'm the only one who
can open this vault for you.

29:13.285 --> 29:15.788
While it's true
I need your DNA,

29:15.822 --> 29:17.756
one doesn't negate the other.

29:18.424 --> 29:19.458
I still love you.

29:20.492 --> 29:21.493
I still want to help you.

29:23.029 --> 29:24.797
I promise it won't hurt.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.799
The only person
you want to help is yourself.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.034
I'll take
my chances on my own.

29:28.067 --> 29:29.401

29:29.435 --> 29:31.270
I think you should
listen to your mother.

29:32.338 --> 29:34.540
He doesn't want to, Lena.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.076
Put your hand
on the pad and we can
all start getting along again.

29:38.310 --> 29:39.345
I promise.

29:39.378 --> 29:40.379
No.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.349
I'm trying to play nice.

not helping.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.477

30:11.510 --> 30:13.045
But have you
found anything yet?

30:13.079 --> 30:15.081
I promise I will tell you.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.349
Haven't you ever
heard the phrase,
"A watched pot never..." Oh.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.618
Whoa, wait a second,
I might be simmering.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.320
What is it?

30:21.353 --> 30:24.924
Okay, so I hacked into
L-Corp CCTV to get a copy

30:24.957 --> 30:28.127
of the raw video footage
of Lena taking the Kryptonite.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.196
But, ha! It looks like
somebody already hacked into

30:30.229 --> 30:32.064
this system
a couple of days ago.

30:32.098 --> 30:34.200
I know this code.

30:34.233 --> 30:37.603
This is the same code
the real Hank Henshaw used

30:37.636 --> 30:41.007
the day he broke into
L-Corp to take the isotope.

30:41.040 --> 30:45.277
Okay, okay,
if the video was corrupted
by Henshaw's cyborg signature,

30:45.311 --> 30:48.647
then I can
reverse that signature

30:48.680 --> 30:50.416
and decrypt it

30:50.449 --> 30:54.153
and separate the raw video
file from the corrupted one.

30:54.186 --> 30:56.055
And...

30:57.523 --> 30:59.258
-Ha!
-Lena didn't do it.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.128
You were right?

31:03.262 --> 31:04.430
-I mean, you were right.
-Yeah.

scan for Kryptonite signature,
so we could find Metallo.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.142
Have you found it,
Agent Schott?

31:16.175 --> 31:18.644
Yep! 50 miles north
of Mount Whitney.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.113
What? Wait.
It's strange because

31:21.147 --> 31:24.650

wrong with the signal,
or the source isn't pure.

Kryptonite is normally
the most stable of elements.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.658
Well, James said Metallo's
Kryptonite seemed off.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.393
It could be synthetic.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.394
That'd explain how they
had it in the first place.

decreasing exponentially.

32:05.524 --> 32:06.625
it's gonna send out
a radioactive cloud

32:06.658 --> 32:08.227
of Kryptonite gas.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.196

34:38.244 --> 34:40.312
Take it out, let me help you.

34:40.346 --> 34:41.380
You're a liar.

34:42.881 --> 34:44.082
Martian.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.087
Get Lena, let's go.

34:55.227 --> 34:56.395
Kara, please!

34:56.428 --> 34:57.763
Supergirl,
get out of there now!

35:02.368 --> 35:03.535
Kara!

35:03.569 --> 35:04.770
(RUMBLING)

35:06.905 --> 35:08.374
-Kara!
-Kara!

35:11.377 --> 35:12.778
(EXPLOSION)

35:25.724 --> 35:28.360
I'm not one to usually gloat

35:28.394 --> 35:31.230
or say,
"I told you so." But...

35:31.263 --> 35:34.233
It doesn't seem
like I was the one
with confirmation bias.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.301
(CLICKS TONGUE)

35:35.334 --> 35:37.236
Yesterday she was guilty.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.771
Today she's not.

35:39.805 --> 35:42.208
It's not confirmation bias,
Danvers,

35:42.874 --> 35:46.378
it's just the news game.

35:46.412 --> 35:49.948
And since you've got enough
time on your hands to stand
around and look up at that TV,

35:49.981 --> 35:53.552
how about you
get out there and get
an exclusive on Lena Luthor?

35:53.585 --> 35:54.686
This time,

35:55.821 --> 35:57.289
try to
spell "exclusive" right.

36:08.500 --> 36:09.735
Hey.

36:09.768 --> 36:13.205
Any, um, any word
on Lillian Luthor?

36:13.239 --> 36:15.207
A satellite feed
from the mountain

36:15.241 --> 36:18.344
showed a helicopter
before the explosion.

36:18.377 --> 36:20.646
But, uh, no sign
of her afterwards?

36:21.847 --> 36:23.449
Lillian and Henshaw got away.

36:23.849 --> 36:24.850
Yeah.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.619
You were right.

36:27.653 --> 36:28.654
About Lena Luthor.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.323
I was wrong.

36:32.858 --> 36:33.859
I'm sorry.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.297
You were
just trying to protect me.

36:38.330 --> 36:39.698
Yeah.

36:39.731 --> 36:42.634
Just like you're
always trying to protect me.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.237
Can we just stop
trying to protect each other

36:45.271 --> 36:46.505
and go back to being friends?

36:46.538 --> 36:48.474
Because I really miss
being friends.

36:49.007 --> 36:50.208
Me, too.

36:53.412 --> 36:54.846
Haven't had
a game night in a while.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.382
A game night sounds great.

36:56.415 --> 36:57.783
Are you ever going
to let me win though?

36:57.816 --> 36:59.451
-Never.
-Sounds about right.

36:59.485 --> 37:00.486
(CHUCKLES)

37:01.753 --> 37:02.821
Deal.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.538
It's a good article.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.307
-You flatter me.
-I only wrote the truth.

37:23.842 --> 37:29.481
I'm learning to keep digging
even when all the evidence
points one way.

37:29.515 --> 37:30.616
There's always another side.

37:30.649 --> 37:31.750
Even when it's hard to find.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.519
Especially
when it's hard to find.

37:35.854 --> 37:39.558
So, my office is
overflowing with flowers.

37:39.591 --> 37:40.859
-Really?
-Yeah.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.696
You didn't have to do that.

37:44.730 --> 37:47.433
Yeah, I did.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.868
Supergirl told me that
it was you who sent her.

37:51.403 --> 37:53.038
I don't know
how to thank you.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.873
Well, that's
what friends are for.

37:56.542 --> 37:59.778
I've never had
friends like you before.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.713
Come to think of it,
I've never had
family like you.

38:04.816 --> 38:06.918
No one has
ever stood up
for me like that.

38:06.952 --> 38:10.456
Well, now you have someone
that will stand up for you.
Always.

38:12.824 --> 38:15.060
Well, Supergirl
may have saved me,

38:15.093 --> 38:17.829
but, Kara Danvers,
you are my hero.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.766
(BOTH LAUGHING)

38:23.635 --> 38:24.903
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

38:26.104 --> 38:27.473
-Bye.
-Bye.

38:46.492 --> 38:47.593
Check.

38:52.163 --> 38:53.599
Checkmate.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.135
I really like this game.

38:57.168 --> 38:59.505
Maybe you are
a Luthor after all.

39:13.752 --> 39:14.753
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

39:15.887 --> 39:17.989
-Hi.
-Thanks for coming.

39:18.023 --> 39:21.159
Yeah, Yeah, I was, um,
surprised you called
after how you dashed out.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.663
Yes, I wanted
to apologize for that.

39:24.696 --> 39:27.399
Because I should've
answered your question.

39:27.433 --> 39:28.467
Yeah, could've.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.536
Could've, should've, would've.

39:30.569 --> 39:33.071
It's a... That's a thing
I heard at the bar.

39:33.104 --> 39:34.473
It's not...

39:34.506 --> 39:37.576
Yes, but I don't
want to do that anymore.

39:38.544 --> 39:39.545
With you.

39:42.981 --> 39:44.416
See, uh...

39:45.917 --> 39:46.918
(CHUCKLES)

39:48.854 --> 39:51.690
I can be strong,

39:51.723 --> 39:54.560
and stand
my ground when I'm
protecting someone else,

39:56.094 --> 39:57.796
but when that someone is me...

39:58.864 --> 40:00.699
It's a lot harder.

40:00.732 --> 40:04.402
'Cause I don't
like being vulnerable.

40:10.676 --> 40:11.977
We're really different.

40:12.811 --> 40:14.212
Yeah.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.515
I'm, uh, super fun.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.049
And you're hyper-critical.

40:18.083 --> 40:21.086
More like, you're
an arrogant dude-bro

40:21.119 --> 40:23.955
and I'm the personification
of the American way.

40:23.989 --> 40:25.824
I'm sorry, and I'm arrogant?

40:25.857 --> 40:26.892
That's not the point.

40:30.696 --> 40:33.064
It's just...

40:33.098 --> 40:36.868
Last year I thought
I could have it all,
and then I thought I couldn't.

40:37.769 --> 40:38.770
Then I had to pick.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.643
So, I chose being Supergirl
over having a relationship.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.749
And then, you came along,

40:55.120 --> 40:58.123
and I thought you were...

40:59.525 --> 41:01.727
...thoughtless and selfish.

41:03.161 --> 41:04.863
And I kept writing you off.

41:06.798 --> 41:08.600
And you kept proving me wrong.

41:11.770 --> 41:13.505
And I just got me thinking...

41:16.742 --> 41:18.476
Maybe I can have it all.

41:24.950 --> 41:25.951
Hi.

41:26.752 --> 41:27.786
Hi.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.133
Darling!

41:42.167 --> 41:43.635
Who the hell are you?

41:43.669 --> 41:45.503
My name is Mr. Mxyzptlk.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.040
And Kara Zor-El, I love you.
