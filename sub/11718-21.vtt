00:07.324 --> 00:08.991
Vanessa, let me in!

00:09.026 --> 00:11.277
Mommy? I'm scared.

00:11.311 --> 00:12.695
- Shh!
- Open the door.

00:12.746 --> 00:13.746
Kaitlyn, I know you are.

00:13.780 --> 00:15.314
You just have to be
real quiet now.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.817
Vanessa! Let me in!

00:18.835 --> 00:20.536
911. What is your emergency?

00:20.587 --> 00:22.421
Hello? Yes, I need you to send
someone here right away.

00:22.456 --> 00:23.956
What's the emergency, ma'am?

00:23.990 --> 00:25.925
My ex-husband-- he's trying
to break into the house.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.627
Vanessa, open the door!
I think he's been drinking.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.961
Please, my children are here.

00:28.995 --> 00:31.130
Does he have any weapons?

00:31.164 --> 00:32.331
He owns several guns.

00:32.348 --> 00:34.183
Can you please hurry?

00:39.823 --> 00:41.607
HPD! Raise your hands
and get down here!

00:43.327 --> 00:44.777
Sir, come out
where we can see you!

00:44.811 --> 00:46.979
Hands where I can see them!
Do it now!

00:51.418 --> 00:54.320
Help me. Please.

Danny?

01:58.982 --> 02:00.900
Hey.

02:00.934 --> 02:03.719
Thanks for coming.

02:04.559 --> 02:05.976
How'd you get in?

02:06.657 --> 02:10.008
I had a-a key
from when I was crashing here.

02:11.078 --> 02:13.195
You know you could look
at that stuff all night

02:13.229 --> 02:15.898
and not be any closer
to figuring it out.

02:15.916 --> 02:19.118
Well, I think I may have
figured out where he went.

02:21.505 --> 02:23.589
Never seen this.

02:23.623 --> 02:24.607
"Shelburne."

02:24.608 --> 02:27.193
That is definitely not
in his handwriting.

02:27.244 --> 02:29.329
No, it's his father's.

02:29.363 --> 02:30.530
All right, so what?

02:30.581 --> 02:31.915
You're going off
to Japan, too?

02:31.949 --> 02:33.649
No, I am not going off
to Japan, okay?

02:33.667 --> 02:36.836
I'm gonna stay here and I'm
gonna do my job, all right?

02:36.871 --> 02:39.506
Because leaving and not telling
anybody where I'm going

02:39.540 --> 02:41.007
is not my style.

02:41.041 --> 02:42.876
Yeah, I know.

02:42.927 --> 02:44.961
I mean, this guy--
h-he leaves me a note.

02:44.995 --> 02:46.346
He says he's going
up to Shelburne

02:46.380 --> 02:49.332
and disappears for a week,
and he doesn't call.

02:49.350 --> 02:50.500
He doesn't say,
"I am alive."

02:50.518 --> 02:51.801
He doesn't say,
"Everything's okay."

02:51.835 --> 02:53.503
Well, Steve believes
Shelburne is the answer

02:53.521 --> 02:57.140
to a lot of questions, including
why his father was murdered.

02:57.174 --> 02:59.559
Yeah, but his father's dead,

02:59.610 --> 03:01.895
and-and finding Shelburne
is not gonna change that.

03:01.946 --> 03:03.229
I promise you that.

03:05.199 --> 03:07.634
Good evening, Governor.

03:10.854 --> 03:13.156
Okay.

03:13.190 --> 03:14.674
I'm on my way.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.392
Hey, guys.

03:32.426 --> 03:34.544
I thought this was a domestic.
What the hell happened?

03:34.562 --> 03:37.046
Aside from waking up
a foot shorter,

03:37.064 --> 03:38.097
my worst nightmare.

03:38.149 --> 03:40.350
Estranged husband tries
to break down the door.

03:40.384 --> 03:42.435
Drops dead right
after HPD arrives

03:42.486 --> 03:44.220
from hemorrhagic smallpox.

03:44.238 --> 03:47.056
Apparently, that's a rare strain
that's almost always fatal.

03:47.074 --> 03:50.360
Wait a minute. Smallpox.
Hasn't that been eradicated?

03:50.394 --> 03:51.394
See, you can't believe

03:51.412 --> 03:53.363
everything that you read
on the Internet.

03:53.397 --> 03:55.448
Okay, so how did he get it?
We don't know.

03:55.499 --> 03:56.833
CDC's trying
to figure it out.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.085
In the meantime,
the governor wants us to run

03:59.119 --> 04:00.286
a parallel investigation
quietly.

04:00.337 --> 04:01.571
Understood.

04:01.589 --> 04:02.906
Right.

04:02.940 --> 04:05.091
Wow, Max, uh...

04:05.125 --> 04:06.559
you get that at the mall?
It's a nice look for you.

04:06.594 --> 04:09.429
Thank you.
However, it is very itchy.

04:10.548 --> 04:11.881
Were you able to examine
the victim?

04:11.915 --> 04:14.634
Briefly before the CDC removed
and incinerated him.

04:14.685 --> 04:17.720
How are we supposed to do an
investigation without a body?

04:17.754 --> 04:19.055
Not to worry.

04:19.089 --> 04:21.940
I was able to obtain blood
and tissue samples, plus...

04:22.977 --> 04:24.093
I have pictures.

04:26.163 --> 04:29.265
The victim's name
is Bryan Palmer, 36 years old.

04:29.283 --> 04:31.234
He was honorably discharged
from the Army ten months ago

04:31.268 --> 04:32.485
after serving a couple tours

04:32.536 --> 04:33.936
in Afghanistan,

04:33.954 --> 04:36.155
and he's be collecting
disability ever since.

04:36.207 --> 04:37.373
If he was military,

04:37.408 --> 04:39.042
he was probably vaccinated
for smallpox recently,

04:39.076 --> 04:41.160
so how'd he end up like this?

04:41.212 --> 04:42.629
The vaccination
could have worn off.

04:42.663 --> 04:45.114
It's typically effective
for only three to five years.

04:45.132 --> 04:46.399
Stop. I have a question.

04:46.433 --> 04:49.636
How does this guy catch an
extinct disease to begin with?

04:49.670 --> 04:51.421
The only known stores
of smallpox in the world

04:51.455 --> 04:52.755
are housed in two facilities:

04:52.789 --> 04:54.724
one is the CDC
in the United States,

04:54.758 --> 04:57.477
and the other is in a lab called
VECTOR in Koltsovo, Russia.

04:57.511 --> 04:59.729
But the CIA thinks there
are also hidden stores

04:59.763 --> 05:02.482
in Russia, France,
North Korea, and Iraq.

05:02.516 --> 05:04.183
Why, so a terrorist
can get his hands on it

05:04.235 --> 05:05.318
and start an epidemic?

05:05.352 --> 05:07.970
Okay, could he have been
exposed in Afghanistan?

05:07.988 --> 05:09.355
No, too much time has passed.

05:09.406 --> 05:12.308
Rash onset typically occurs
within two weeks of exposure.

05:12.326 --> 05:14.327
Mr. Palmer has been stateside
for nearly a year.

05:14.361 --> 05:16.412
The first thing
we need to find out

05:16.447 --> 05:17.747
is when and where
he caught this thing.

05:17.781 --> 05:20.533
I don't think he was exposed
in the traditional way.

05:20.584 --> 05:21.534
What do you mean?

05:21.585 --> 05:23.286
Well, smallpox is
generally transmitted

05:23.320 --> 05:25.255
through face-to-face contact
with a sick person.

05:25.289 --> 05:28.041
Transmission through an infected
object, such as clothing,

05:28.092 --> 05:30.043
is also possible,
but less effective.

05:30.094 --> 05:31.978
However, in Mr. Palmer's case...

05:32.012 --> 05:32.979
May I?

05:33.013 --> 05:34.497
Go for it.

05:43.307 --> 05:46.626
Ah, yes. This appears to be
an injection site.

05:46.660 --> 05:48.478
And that is how
I believe the victim

05:48.512 --> 05:50.346
contracted the virus.

05:50.364 --> 05:51.447
Whoa, are you saying

05:51.482 --> 05:52.649
that smallpox was used
as a murder weapon?

05:52.683 --> 05:53.866
Yes.

05:53.901 --> 05:55.068
And depending on how long

05:55.119 --> 05:57.453
he was walking in public
while contagious,

05:57.488 --> 05:58.288
within a few weeks...

05:58.322 --> 06:00.306
The entire island
could be infected.

06:16.270 --> 06:17.987
The doctor
doesn't think we're infected,

06:17.989 --> 06:20.107
but he wants to keep us
for observation,

06:20.141 --> 06:22.192
just to be safe.

06:22.243 --> 06:23.860
I can't believe
Bryan was so sick.

06:24.911 --> 06:26.996
I should've helped him.

06:27.030 --> 06:29.248
No, listen to me.

06:29.283 --> 06:31.867
You 100% did the right thing.
Okay?

06:31.918 --> 06:33.669
I mean, you probably saved
your life and your kids' life

06:33.704 --> 06:34.954
by not opening that door.

06:34.988 --> 06:37.417
Mrs. Palmer, we're hoping
you can help us

06:37.418 --> 06:40.537
build a timeline of where
Bryan was the past few weeks.

06:40.571 --> 06:42.872
Uh... I really can't.

06:42.906 --> 06:44.457
Bryan moved out
a couple months ago.

06:44.508 --> 06:45.758
We were having

06:45.793 --> 06:48.127
some problems after he came back
from Afghanistan.

06:48.162 --> 06:49.546
Okay, where was he living?

06:49.580 --> 06:50.797
Breakers Motel.

06:50.831 --> 06:52.799
He was doing really well.

06:52.850 --> 06:54.100
I mean, up until recently,

06:54.134 --> 06:56.052
I thought there was a chance
for us to work it out.

06:56.086 --> 06:57.270
What changed your mind?

06:57.304 --> 06:58.688
A few weeks ago,

06:58.722 --> 07:00.106
he just dropped out.

07:00.140 --> 07:03.977
Um, he skipped
family counseling.

07:04.028 --> 07:06.813
He wouldn't return
phone calls.

07:06.864 --> 07:08.948
I figured he'd gone back
to his dark place again.

07:08.983 --> 07:11.534
What, uh, what does that mean?
What's his dark place?

07:11.569 --> 07:12.986
He starts drinking,

07:13.037 --> 07:16.272
holes himself up and doesn't
talk to anybody for days.

07:16.290 --> 07:17.790
It's pretty awful.

07:20.494 --> 07:22.378
Mrs. Palmer,
I need to draw some blood.

07:22.413 --> 07:24.447
Can you put on
your mask, ma'am?

07:24.465 --> 07:25.882
Your children, too.

07:25.916 --> 07:28.084
Okay. Sure.

07:30.938 --> 07:32.472
Okay, let's, uh...

07:32.506 --> 07:34.457
let's hope that she's right
about the dark place.

07:34.475 --> 07:35.625
Why's that?

07:35.643 --> 07:37.460
It means he's locked up
in a hotel room.

07:37.478 --> 07:39.462
He's not out infecting
the entire island.

07:39.496 --> 07:41.180
Right.

07:41.231 --> 07:43.299
All right, I'll call the CDC.

07:43.317 --> 07:45.435
I guess we should check out
Palmer's room.

07:45.469 --> 07:47.353
You want to go check out

07:47.404 --> 07:48.488
a smallpox-infested room?

07:48.522 --> 07:49.989
Yeah.

07:50.024 --> 07:52.442
Yeah, that sounds, uh...

07:52.476 --> 07:54.827
like a real hoot.

07:59.116 --> 08:00.983
What are you doing about Grace?

08:01.001 --> 08:03.419
Well, luckily, she's on
the mainland with Rachel

08:03.454 --> 08:05.838
and Stan and the baby,
visiting the grandparents.

08:05.873 --> 08:06.839
What about Malia?

08:06.874 --> 08:08.257
I haven't said anything yet,

08:08.292 --> 08:09.659
but I've already checked
outbound flights.

08:09.677 --> 08:10.927
If this thing goes south,

08:10.961 --> 08:12.595
I'm getting her off the island.

08:19.603 --> 08:22.939
Doesn't exactly look like
a dark place of despair.

08:25.225 --> 08:27.360
I don't see any alcohol.

08:29.446 --> 08:31.114
The 12 Steps.

08:31.148 --> 08:34.116
Looks like this guy really was
getting his act together.

08:40.407 --> 08:42.857
Max said the smallpox could've
been used as a murder weapon?

08:42.876 --> 08:44.126
Yeah, why?

08:44.160 --> 08:46.129
Well, either this guy
killed himself

08:46.196 --> 08:47.880
in a really horrible way,

08:47.915 --> 08:49.699
or I found a bunch
of loaded guns.

08:54.755 --> 08:56.889
<i>So... it's not smallpox.</i>

08:56.924 --> 08:59.258
Then what the hell is it?

08:59.293 --> 09:00.760
CDC says the vials you found

09:00.811 --> 09:02.712
in Palmer's motel room
contain cyclotriptine.

09:02.730 --> 09:04.097
It's an experimental
antidepressant

09:04.148 --> 09:06.882
undergoing clinical trials
pending FDA approval.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.351
Okay, so the injection mark

09:08.385 --> 09:11.354
on Palmer's arm came
from the antidepressant.

09:11.388 --> 09:13.556
That's the weird thing,
'cause Max ran a tox screen,

09:13.574 --> 09:15.441
and there was no cyclotriptine
in his system.

09:15.492 --> 09:16.743
He never took it.

09:16.777 --> 09:19.245
Meaning Max's smallpox
injection theory still stands.

09:19.279 --> 09:21.247
All right, hold on.

09:21.281 --> 09:24.066
This... this guy Palmer,
he had the drug, right?

09:24.084 --> 09:26.035
So he had to be part
of the clinical trial.

09:26.069 --> 09:27.537
There's gotta be, hopefully,

09:27.571 --> 09:28.671
a connection between the trial

09:28.706 --> 09:30.506
and how he was exposed
to smallpox.

09:30.541 --> 09:32.709
That's what I was thinking,
so I contacted

09:32.743 --> 09:34.010
the pharmaceutical company,
Bio-Statim.

09:34.044 --> 09:37.513
They are conducting trials
here on Oahu.

09:37.548 --> 09:39.465
Unfortunately,
the trials are double-blind.

09:39.516 --> 09:41.184
So they don't know
who the participants are.

09:41.218 --> 09:42.585
Well, somebody has
to have the names.

09:42.603 --> 09:44.754
Well, yeah, the local project
manager, Ken Tanner.

09:44.772 --> 09:46.589
He was the one who recruited
the participants.

09:46.607 --> 09:48.257
Okay, let's go talk to him.

09:48.275 --> 09:50.209
Well, the thing is...

09:50.244 --> 09:51.644
we have to find him first.

09:51.695 --> 09:53.279
Because I contacted
the local Bio-Statim offices.

09:53.313 --> 09:54.764
He never showed up
to work today.

09:54.782 --> 09:57.200
All right, uh...
let's find a home address

09:57.234 --> 09:58.267
on this guy.
Okay.

09:58.285 --> 10:00.803
Hey. Crime lab.

10:02.939 --> 10:04.273
Aloha, Charlie.

10:04.308 --> 10:05.708
How about some good news?

10:05.743 --> 10:06.743
I can accommodate that.

10:06.777 --> 10:08.578
I pinged your
victim's cell phone.

10:08.612 --> 10:10.463
And found it. Still active.

10:10.497 --> 10:11.664
I can send you the coordinates.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.032
Great work.
Thank you, Fong.

10:13.066 --> 10:16.302
All right, you, uh,
you track down Palmer's cell.

10:16.336 --> 10:18.004
We'll go make a house call
to this drug company guy.

10:18.055 --> 10:19.388
Send me that address, please.

10:34.988 --> 10:37.106
Ken Tanner?

10:40.644 --> 10:42.161
Ken Tanner, open up!
Let me ask you a question.

10:42.196 --> 10:43.446
What does that look
like to you?

10:43.480 --> 10:45.114
Mosquito bite.

10:45.148 --> 10:47.099
Mosquito bite. What do you know?
You're not a doctor.

10:47.134 --> 10:49.335
No, but you're
a hypochondriac.

10:55.509 --> 10:57.493
Oh, what is that?

10:58.545 --> 11:00.413
I hear an engine running.

11:07.304 --> 11:09.288
He's in there.
Get it open. Come on.

11:30.494 --> 11:32.194
He's ice cold.

11:32.212 --> 11:34.163
He's been dead
for a while.

11:34.198 --> 11:35.464
All right.

11:35.499 --> 11:37.750
I guess now we know why
he didn't show up for work.

11:37.801 --> 11:41.003
Guilty conscience
over Palmer's death.

11:52.850 --> 11:54.500
Hey.

11:57.154 --> 11:58.387
We got blood.

11:58.405 --> 12:01.073
Maybe this wasn't
a suicide after all.

12:30.304 --> 12:33.072
♪ ♪

13:10.594 --> 13:12.061
Hey, Charlie.

13:12.095 --> 13:13.813
I found the victim's cell phone.

13:13.847 --> 13:15.731
Among some other things.

13:15.766 --> 13:17.483
Going to need you
to process them right away.

13:21.989 --> 13:23.806
Okay, so Fong's
going through

13:23.824 --> 13:24.991
the bag of hazardous
goodies now.

13:25.025 --> 13:26.525
Did you find anything
at Tanner's place?

13:26.576 --> 13:28.694
No. Whoever killed him
also took his computer

13:28.729 --> 13:30.463
and everything related
to the cyclotriptine trials.

13:33.951 --> 13:35.501
Who was that?

13:35.535 --> 13:36.669
Uh, nothing.

13:36.703 --> 13:38.404
I... someone I can
just talk to later.

13:38.438 --> 13:39.755
That somebody have a name?

13:39.790 --> 13:42.091
What? I can't have
a private life?

13:42.125 --> 13:44.410
Ooh. Is it a boy?

13:44.444 --> 13:45.578
Is he cute?

13:45.612 --> 13:46.796
Okay, leave me alone.

13:46.830 --> 13:48.163
I knew something was up.

13:48.181 --> 13:50.016
You got that glow.

13:50.050 --> 13:52.518
Okay, I do not glow.

13:52.552 --> 13:53.803
Uh-huh.

13:53.837 --> 13:55.688
Give it up. What's his name?

13:55.722 --> 13:57.873
You'll find out
when the time is right.

13:57.908 --> 13:59.225
All right, be like that.

13:59.276 --> 14:01.477
But just remember who's going
to walk you down the aisle.

14:01.511 --> 14:03.562
Okay, that's going to be
a very, very long ways away.

14:03.613 --> 14:05.698
Not at this rate.

14:06.566 --> 14:09.652
Okay, Ken Tanner did
not kill himself.

14:09.686 --> 14:11.620
How do you know?
Max just did the autopsy.

14:11.655 --> 14:13.072
His cause of death
was blunt force trauma

14:13.123 --> 14:14.123
to the back of his skull.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.357
Crime scene techs
pulled a print

14:15.375 --> 14:16.792
off the keys we found
in the ignition.

14:16.827 --> 14:19.078
We found the car,
and the guy's in the system.

14:19.129 --> 14:20.546
His name is Dracul Comescu.

14:20.580 --> 14:23.165
Who the hell is that?

14:23.199 --> 14:24.216
He's not a vampire.

14:24.251 --> 14:25.584
I thought the very same thing.

14:25.635 --> 14:28.004
He is a Romanian national
who's on the NCIS watch list.

14:28.038 --> 14:29.889
Very specifically, the
Office of Special Projects

14:29.923 --> 14:31.807
in Los Angeles.
So, what's he doing here?

14:31.842 --> 14:33.542
I don't know.
I'm going to find out.

14:33.560 --> 14:34.894
Just give me a minute.

14:42.385 --> 14:44.386
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:44.404 --> 14:45.404
Special Agent Hanna?

14:45.439 --> 14:46.472
Yeah. Who's this?

14:46.506 --> 14:47.723
This is Detective Danny Williams

14:47.741 --> 14:49.391
with the Governor's
Special Task Force in Hawaii.

14:49.409 --> 14:51.861
I believe you know a friend
of mine-- a colleague--

14:51.895 --> 14:53.162
Steve McGarrett.
Yeah, I know him.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.364
What, is he too busy surfing
to call me himself?

14:55.398 --> 14:56.615
No, he's...

14:56.666 --> 14:58.067
sort of on leave right now.

14:58.085 --> 14:59.418
Listen, I am calling

14:59.453 --> 15:01.704
about a suspect of ours
that we are tracking.

15:01.738 --> 15:03.672
Uh, I believe
he's on your watch list.

15:03.707 --> 15:05.624
His name is Dracul Comescu.

15:06.576 --> 15:07.793
Detective Williams,

15:07.844 --> 15:09.628
this is Special Agent Callen.

15:09.679 --> 15:12.214
Are you telling me
Comescu is in Hawaii?

15:12.249 --> 15:14.350
We found his prints
at... at a murder scene.

15:14.384 --> 15:16.685
Um, you...
you got history with this guy?

15:16.720 --> 15:18.420
Yeah.

15:18.438 --> 15:20.222
A very personal one.

15:20.256 --> 15:22.608
Dracul's part of a Romanian
organized crime family,

15:22.642 --> 15:24.593
and let's just say we ended

15:24.611 --> 15:26.562
the family business
not too long ago.

15:26.596 --> 15:29.865
Okay, well, it looks like,
uh, he's got a new hobby.

15:29.900 --> 15:32.618
Uh, he may have gotten his hands
on the smallpox virus.

15:34.738 --> 15:36.572
That's why the Hawaii
National Guard

15:36.606 --> 15:38.941
is plussing up their WMD
civil support team.

15:38.959 --> 15:40.826
The Air Force
is sending a bird tonight.

15:40.877 --> 15:43.496
So, technically,
you guys could hitch a ride?

15:43.547 --> 15:45.381
How do you feel
about pineapples?

15:45.415 --> 15:47.133
We're on our way.

15:57.801 --> 16:00.503
Charlie,
find anything useful?

16:00.554 --> 16:03.121
Not useful so much
as intriguing.

16:03.139 --> 16:04.607
Look at this.

16:05.926 --> 16:06.976
Size medium.

16:07.010 --> 16:08.177
That's Bryan Palmer's size.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.512
I have three of those.

16:09.546 --> 16:11.013
Okay.

16:11.064 --> 16:12.798
Size double XL.

16:12.816 --> 16:14.016
Four of those.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.401
Huh. That's weird.

16:15.435 --> 16:16.819
Those must belong
to somebody else.

16:16.853 --> 16:18.103
Plus...

16:18.137 --> 16:20.856
I have pants
that are varying in size.

16:20.907 --> 16:24.777
28 waist on a few,
40 waist on some others.

16:24.811 --> 16:26.529
Altogether,
I'd say we have

16:26.580 --> 16:28.313
at least four
distinct sets of clothing.

16:28.331 --> 16:30.416
We may have
other victims out there.

16:30.450 --> 16:31.534
Is there any identification?

16:31.585 --> 16:33.786
Not as such.

16:33.820 --> 16:34.954
However...

16:34.988 --> 16:37.039
I've got a few dozen
hair samples to run

16:37.090 --> 16:38.490
against the
DNA database.

16:38.508 --> 16:41.777
I'll let you know if I get a hit.
Perfect. Thanks.

16:58.528 --> 17:00.296
Hey.

17:00.330 --> 17:01.730
Danny Williams.
Welcome to Hawaii.

17:01.765 --> 17:03.232
Callen.
Hanna.

17:03.283 --> 17:05.200
What's up, buddy?
McGarrett trying to skip out

17:05.234 --> 17:06.952
on the steak dinner
he owes me?

17:06.987 --> 17:09.722
That would explain
a lot. Come on.

17:09.756 --> 17:10.873
So, how bad is it?

17:10.906 --> 17:11.991
The good news is,

17:12.025 --> 17:14.159
no other cases of
smallpox have come up.

17:14.194 --> 17:15.544
Bad news is CDC
has not had any luck

17:15.579 --> 17:17.546
with their contact
trace on our victim.

17:17.580 --> 17:18.881
The guy went missing
about a week ago.

17:18.915 --> 17:20.198
We have no idea
where he was.

17:20.215 --> 17:21.800
Which means we don't know
who else he infected.

17:21.835 --> 17:23.002
That's exactly what
it means, yeah.

17:23.036 --> 17:24.435
Now, we picked up
the latest chatter

17:24.471 --> 17:25.871
on Dracul Comescu.

17:25.888 --> 17:27.973
He's spent the past
three months in Siberia.

17:28.008 --> 17:29.842
Let me guess:
he's buying smallpox.

17:29.876 --> 17:31.760
Well, based on what
you've been dealing with here,

17:31.811 --> 17:34.980
that would be the theory,
but Dracul is not an ideologue.

17:35.015 --> 17:38.434
His main agenda
is making money, not terrorism.

17:38.485 --> 17:40.486
Our guess is that
he found a buyer

17:40.520 --> 17:42.321
looking for
a biological weapon.

17:42.355 --> 17:44.389
Hold on. You're telling
me that this guy

17:44.407 --> 17:46.058
is ready to risk a
worldwide epidemic

17:46.076 --> 17:47.610
just to make
some cash?

17:47.661 --> 17:49.111
Without even blinking.
What about you?

17:49.162 --> 17:51.730
I hear you got a
personal beef with him.

17:51.748 --> 17:54.333
Comescus tried
to kill my entire family.

17:54.367 --> 17:55.784
Say again.

17:55.819 --> 17:56.769
Blood feud.

17:56.803 --> 17:58.020
Ah.

17:58.054 --> 17:59.755
Well, that, uh... that happens.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.591
That's a nice ride.

18:02.626 --> 18:03.926
Thank you.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.094
What's her name?

18:06.012 --> 18:09.181
Her name is, uh... is Car.

18:09.215 --> 18:10.599
Car?
Yeah.

18:10.634 --> 18:12.468
I'm going to find you a name.

18:12.519 --> 18:14.436
Shotgun.

18:16.773 --> 18:18.707
<i>Agent Callen, Hanna,</i>

18:18.742 --> 18:20.976
<i>NCIS.</i>
<i>Chin Ho Kelly,</i>

18:21.027 --> 18:22.594
Kono Kalakaua, Hawaii Five-O.
Welcome.

18:22.629 --> 18:24.813
Steve speaks
very highly of you.

18:24.864 --> 18:26.031
Well, I'm sorry
he missed the party.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.100
Yeah, all right,
enough with the pleasantries.

18:28.118 --> 18:30.202
- Uh, Kono, what's good?
- So, one of our techs

18:30.236 --> 18:32.121
was able to identify
four distinct DNA samples

18:32.155 --> 18:33.288
from the bag we found.

18:33.323 --> 18:35.374
The victim, Bryan Palmer,
being one of them.

18:35.408 --> 18:38.744
The rest we were able
to pull from the database.

18:38.778 --> 18:40.946
So, we have Paul Scully,
Terence Hill, Luis Salazar.

18:42.165 --> 18:43.582
And we can't find
any of them.

18:43.616 --> 18:44.633
I got to take this.
Sorry.

18:44.668 --> 18:45.801
HPD search their homes,

18:45.835 --> 18:48.337
and what do they find
in every medicine cabinet?

18:48.371 --> 18:50.622
Experimental antidepressants.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.174
That's right--
they were all on

18:52.225 --> 18:53.458
the cyclotriptine
clinical trial.

18:53.476 --> 18:56.261
But that's not the only thing
they had in common.

18:56.296 --> 18:58.497
They were all either
single or divorced,

18:58.531 --> 19:00.132
no family on the island,

19:00.150 --> 19:02.117
and they were all
on disability,

19:02.152 --> 19:03.435
so no jobs to go to.

19:03.469 --> 19:04.987
Which makes them ideal victims.

19:05.021 --> 19:06.655
They go missing,
no one's looking for them.

19:06.690 --> 19:09.441
So you're saying this whole drug
trial thing was a sham or...?

19:09.475 --> 19:10.809
Well, I contacted
the pharmaceutical company.

19:10.827 --> 19:12.111
The trial's legit.

19:12.145 --> 19:13.412
- Okay.
- Maybe the trial

19:13.446 --> 19:15.164
is how he got to these guys.

19:15.198 --> 19:16.615
What do you mean?
Ken Tanner.

19:16.649 --> 19:17.933
He's got a list of people

19:17.967 --> 19:19.568
willing to undergo
a drug experiment.

19:19.602 --> 19:21.787
Uh, plus he got
all their vital information.

19:21.821 --> 19:23.155
So Comescu bribed him
to get the names of people

19:23.173 --> 19:24.156
that wouldn't be missed.

19:24.207 --> 19:25.657
And he uses them
as guinea pigs.

19:25.675 --> 19:27.509
They think they're
getting antidepressants,

19:27.544 --> 19:29.762
but he's really shooting
them up with smallpox.

19:29.796 --> 19:31.180
And I guarantee you that Comescu

19:31.214 --> 19:33.582
did not plan
on having Bryan Palmer escape.

19:33.616 --> 19:35.667
Right, he escapes, he exposes
the entire experiment.

19:35.685 --> 19:37.469
He's got to clear
his tracks,

19:37.503 --> 19:39.688
so he kills Tanner,
first things first.

19:39.723 --> 19:41.890
Right, well, Scully, Hill, and
Salazar could still be alive.

19:41.925 --> 19:43.341
Yes, and the only way

19:43.359 --> 19:45.227
we're going to help them
is if we find out

19:45.278 --> 19:46.645
where this experiment
is going down, so...

19:46.679 --> 19:47.796
I can help with that.

19:47.831 --> 19:50.348
I had Ken Tanner's
financials run.

19:50.366 --> 19:52.534
This guy was in real trouble.

19:52.569 --> 19:56.088
He was underwater on his
mortgage; he was maxed out

19:56.122 --> 19:58.390
on all of his credit cards;
then two months ago,

19:58.425 --> 20:01.293
he gets a wire transfer
in the amount of $500,000

20:01.327 --> 20:03.912
from a company
called CF&Q Limited.

20:03.963 --> 20:06.031
That's a Comescu
holdings corporation.

20:06.049 --> 20:07.132
All right,
so Tanner keeps half

20:07.167 --> 20:09.168
of the money, and then,
with the other half,

20:09.202 --> 20:11.053
he ends up buying
medical supplies.

20:11.087 --> 20:13.005
He gets, uh, hospital beds,

20:13.039 --> 20:14.539
laboratory equipment

20:14.557 --> 20:16.842
and a sophisticated
air filtration system.

20:16.876 --> 20:18.894
And all of it was delivered
to a warehouse...

20:22.015 --> 20:23.182
...on Sand Island.

20:23.216 --> 20:24.983
You know what they used
to call Sand Island?

20:25.018 --> 20:26.735
What's that?
Quarantine Island.

20:26.770 --> 20:30.072
Sounds like a great place
to start an epidemic.

20:44.587 --> 20:46.738
There's cameras
all over the place.

20:46.756 --> 20:47.956
They probably
already know we're here.

20:48.007 --> 20:49.741
Let's not make them wait, huh?

21:03.039 --> 21:05.023
Cover! Cover!

21:10.763 --> 21:12.147
That's Dracul!
He's in the car.

21:12.198 --> 21:14.233
Let's go!
Move! Move!

21:14.267 --> 21:15.617
Go, go, go, go!

21:37.273 --> 21:38.724
<i>Look, go around</i>

21:38.758 --> 21:39.858
and cut him off.

21:56.626 --> 21:57.693
Get in front of him.

21:57.727 --> 21:58.777
Trying to.

21:58.811 --> 22:00.112
Hold it steady.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.450
You shoot like Ray Charles.
Come on.

22:06.369 --> 22:07.302
Watch out for the dumpster.

22:07.337 --> 22:08.470
I see the dumpster. Thank you.

22:12.041 --> 22:13.292
Might want to work
on your driving position.

22:13.326 --> 22:14.459
Your wrist's
in the wrong place.

22:14.493 --> 22:15.627
My wrists are wrong...?

22:15.661 --> 22:17.462
What is it with Navy SEALs
and backseat driving?

22:18.681 --> 22:19.848
Watch out for the car.

22:19.883 --> 22:20.849
I see the car.

22:25.104 --> 22:26.605
Might want to turn around.

22:26.639 --> 22:27.973
You think so, Doctor?

22:28.007 --> 22:29.575
I do think so.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.031
I ask him to turn around,
he goes in reverse.

22:41.371 --> 22:43.238
Chin, I got jammed up.
Do you see him?

22:43.289 --> 22:45.040
No, we don't.

22:48.561 --> 22:49.878
There he is,

22:49.913 --> 22:51.880
headed for that bridge.
We can't let him

22:51.915 --> 22:53.348
get on the mainland.

23:03.259 --> 23:05.327
Danny, cut him off.
Cut him off.

23:09.215 --> 23:11.049
Chin, we got him.
We're good.

23:35.925 --> 23:37.192
Comescu in there?

23:37.226 --> 23:39.211
No, it's just the driver.

23:39.245 --> 23:41.746
Must have jumped out
at the warehouse.

24:05.705 --> 24:08.006
What the hell is this?

24:09.325 --> 24:11.610
Looks like a
quarantine station.

24:15.331 --> 24:17.215
Really?

24:27.844 --> 24:30.762
Should we call somebody or...?

24:57.457 --> 24:59.324
Salazar, Hill,

24:59.342 --> 25:00.542
<i>and Scully.</i>

25:00.576 --> 25:02.827
He gave them smallpox, too.

25:05.164 --> 25:07.799
Wasn't smallpox

25:07.833 --> 25:10.135
that killed them;
Comescu executed them.

25:40.270 --> 25:42.321
So?
Well, we did find

25:42.356 --> 25:44.440
smallpox virus samples,
but not all of them.

25:44.491 --> 25:46.559
Apparently several
vials are missing.

25:46.577 --> 25:48.361
Well, there was nothing
in Comescu's vehicle.

25:48.395 --> 25:50.363
He must have taken
the virus with him.

25:50.397 --> 25:52.198
This is quite a
sophisticated setup.

25:52.232 --> 25:54.867
Negative pressurization system,
top-of-the-line equipment.

25:54.901 --> 25:56.085
All right,
there's no way

25:56.120 --> 25:57.703
a Romanian thug did this
by himself.

25:57.737 --> 25:58.955
I concur.

25:59.006 --> 26:01.090
Someone with very specialized
scientific knowledge

26:01.125 --> 26:02.741
is involved.
What about the videocameras?

26:02.759 --> 26:04.177
Maybe we got a picture of him.

26:04.211 --> 26:05.595
CDC found footage.

26:05.629 --> 26:06.846
Evidently our
suspect used it

26:06.880 --> 26:09.248
to document the progression
of the disease.

26:09.266 --> 26:11.601
Okay, uh,
we'll have Kono

26:11.635 --> 26:12.751
go over to CDC.

26:12.769 --> 26:14.920
Maybe, uh, Frankenstein
got caught on tape.

26:14.938 --> 26:16.589
Should I be wearing a mask?

26:16.607 --> 26:17.890
Technically, yes.

26:17.924 --> 26:20.359
I'm leaving, okay?

26:22.696 --> 26:25.064
Okay, uh, Callen and Hanna

26:25.098 --> 26:27.116
are looking
for potential smallpox buyers.

26:27.151 --> 26:29.435
They're at TSA,
checking incoming flights.

26:29.453 --> 26:31.037
Meantime, we're gonna go
to this hospital,

26:31.071 --> 26:33.489
see if Comescu's driver
is feeling chatty.

26:33.540 --> 26:34.757
He's not gonna
tell us anything.

26:34.791 --> 26:35.875
No, he's not,

26:35.909 --> 26:37.527
but we are gonna use a page

26:37.561 --> 26:38.794
out of McGarrett's playbook.

26:38.829 --> 26:40.613
And what do you
mean by that?

26:40.631 --> 26:42.748
Take the playbook,
and you set it on fire.

26:43.767 --> 26:44.917
All right.

26:49.006 --> 26:52.225
Patient beta developed
flu-like symptoms 20 hours ago.

26:52.259 --> 26:54.644
Temperature
at 38.5 degrees Celsius.

26:54.678 --> 26:56.962
Eight hours later,

26:56.980 --> 26:58.881
a rash emerged on the tongue
and in the mouth.

26:58.916 --> 27:01.934
I expect the pustular
rash period to begin

27:01.969 --> 27:04.187
within the next ten to 12 hours.

27:04.221 --> 27:06.072
It's astonishing.

27:06.106 --> 27:08.140
If I'm understanding
this correctly,

27:08.158 --> 27:10.276
they have significantly reduced
the incubation

27:10.310 --> 27:11.694
and prodrome periods.

27:11.745 --> 27:12.945
Meaning what?

27:12.979 --> 27:14.413
Well, with hemorrhagic smallpox,

27:14.448 --> 27:17.533
the time between exposure
and death is typically

27:17.584 --> 27:18.834
14 to 28 days.

27:18.869 --> 27:21.921
This version of the virus
reduced that to three days.

27:21.955 --> 27:24.790
So, what kind of impact
would that have on an outbreak?

27:24.824 --> 27:26.125
Monumental.

27:26.159 --> 27:28.010
The disease would spread faster
and more efficiently

27:28.045 --> 27:29.662
than we could mobilize
the vaccine.

27:29.680 --> 27:32.431
You know the man talking--
does he ever appear on camera?

27:32.466 --> 27:33.999
Nah, we've gone
through everything.

27:34.017 --> 27:37.136
He only narrates,
never shows up on screen.

27:37.170 --> 27:38.837
Still, there's something
about him.

27:38.855 --> 27:40.189
What's that?

27:40.224 --> 27:42.358
Well, I feel like
I know that voice.

27:42.392 --> 27:45.461
He sounds familiar to me,
but I can't place him.

27:46.730 --> 27:50.383
Maybe it's not
the first video he's made.

27:56.573 --> 27:58.457
Hey, buddy,

27:58.492 --> 28:01.360
why don't you, uh, grab
a cup of coffee, huh?

28:01.378 --> 28:03.296
All right, thanks.

28:05.983 --> 28:08.217
This is Marku,
Comescu's driver.

28:08.252 --> 28:11.053
You don't look so bad
after all that, huh?

28:12.289 --> 28:14.223
Doc says you got a
couple of fractures,

28:14.258 --> 28:15.558
minor concussion,

28:15.592 --> 28:17.476
but you're gonna be
out of here in no time.

28:17.511 --> 28:19.512
You know what we call
that here in Hawaii?

28:19.546 --> 28:21.480
Pomaika'i.

28:21.548 --> 28:23.399
Good luck.

28:23.433 --> 28:25.368
Yeah, but you know
what they say about luck.

28:25.402 --> 28:27.103
I'm not afraid of you.

28:27.187 --> 28:28.738
Well, you shouldn't
be afraid of <i>me.</i>

28:28.772 --> 28:30.990
'Cause I am a very nice guy.

28:31.024 --> 28:32.775
But this...

28:32.826 --> 28:35.494
This you should
be afraid of.

28:35.529 --> 28:36.829
What is that?

28:36.863 --> 28:38.531
I don't have any idea
what it is.

28:38.565 --> 28:39.749
We found it
in that lab of yours.

28:39.783 --> 28:40.950
We want to test it out now.

28:41.001 --> 28:42.335
See, I like that.

28:42.369 --> 28:44.086
Very scientific.

28:45.455 --> 28:46.739
You're American police officers.

28:46.757 --> 28:48.007
You can't do anything to me.

28:48.041 --> 28:50.126
Well, I'm certainly
not gonna tell anybody.

28:50.177 --> 28:51.410
Are you gonna tell anyone?

28:51.445 --> 28:52.595
Not me.

28:52.629 --> 28:55.014
All right, that's settled.

28:55.048 --> 28:56.549
Where's Comescu?

28:56.583 --> 28:57.933
Screw you.

28:57.968 --> 28:59.352
Okay.

29:01.938 --> 29:03.756
Marku, so hostile.

29:06.410 --> 29:07.693
Hey, what...?

29:07.728 --> 29:08.928
Wait, wait, wait.

29:08.962 --> 29:10.146
Take it out.

29:10.197 --> 29:11.314
Take it out!

29:11.365 --> 29:12.264
I got it stopped.

29:12.282 --> 29:13.582
I'm gonna take it out.

29:13.617 --> 29:15.251
Just tell us where Comescu is.

29:15.285 --> 29:16.819
I-I don't know where he is.
I swear.

29:16.870 --> 29:18.704
All right, we're back
in the building.

29:18.739 --> 29:20.332
How much of the virus
did he take with him?

29:20.357 --> 29:20.956
Stop!

29:20.957 --> 29:22.908
Nine vials, okay?
Take it out.

29:22.942 --> 29:25.294
Okay, okay, who's
he selling it to?

29:25.329 --> 29:28.280
A-All I know is the buy
is going down today.

29:28.298 --> 29:29.231
2:00,

29:29.266 --> 29:31.283
International Market Place.

29:31.301 --> 29:33.386
But, uh, s-s-something is wrong.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.337
What?

29:34.388 --> 29:35.921
When Dracul got there
to pick up the product,

29:35.955 --> 29:37.139
everyone was dead.

29:37.174 --> 29:38.924
All the patients,
shot in the head.

29:38.958 --> 29:40.226
And you expect
us to believe

29:40.260 --> 29:41.344
that you didn't kill those men?

29:41.395 --> 29:42.728
It wasn't us.
I swear to you!

29:42.763 --> 29:44.146
I swear.

29:44.181 --> 29:45.130
Wait!

29:45.148 --> 29:46.349
The doctor...
the doctor was gone.

29:46.400 --> 29:47.683
What doctor?

29:47.734 --> 29:48.651
Give us a name.

29:48.685 --> 29:50.236
I don't know.

29:50.270 --> 29:51.904
I don't know. I swear!

29:51.938 --> 29:54.023
Please, take it out!
It's coming; I can't.

29:54.074 --> 29:55.107
Wait!

29:55.141 --> 29:57.026
Relax, relax, buddy.

29:57.077 --> 29:58.477
It is vitamin B-12.

29:58.495 --> 30:00.479
It is supposed
to aid in healing.

30:00.497 --> 30:01.964
You'll be fine.

30:02.616 --> 30:04.750
Aloha.

30:13.877 --> 30:17.630
The buyers are Chechen rebels
from the Ingushetia Regiment.

30:17.664 --> 30:18.997
Our office is sending pictures.

30:19.015 --> 30:20.383
They blew up a bus stop

30:20.417 --> 30:22.017
in Moscow last year.

30:22.052 --> 30:23.185
Good.

30:23.220 --> 30:24.603
You know what would
make this perfect?

30:24.638 --> 30:26.605
If there was more people here;
I mean, if we're gonna have

30:26.640 --> 30:29.675
a biological disaster,
why don't we go big, you know?

30:29.693 --> 30:31.694
Why do you dress like that?

30:31.728 --> 30:33.646
You're in Hawaii.

30:33.680 --> 30:35.013
It's my style.

30:35.031 --> 30:37.683
It's not a style.
It's a bad habit.

30:38.568 --> 30:39.735
How's it looking, G?

30:40.404 --> 30:42.521
No sign of Dracul yet.

30:44.190 --> 30:46.208
I should have been the one
questioning that driver.

30:46.243 --> 30:47.543
Hey, even your partner

30:47.577 --> 30:49.628
thought that was a bad
idea, Agent Callen.

30:52.716 --> 30:54.884
We just got photos
of the Chechens.

30:56.503 --> 30:58.421
We got Deni Islamov,
Sergei Aminev.

30:58.472 --> 31:00.038
Kono,

31:00.056 --> 31:01.507
what's the bird's-eye view?

31:04.711 --> 31:06.645
Not yet.

31:06.680 --> 31:08.314
Hold on.

31:08.348 --> 31:09.849
Here we go.

31:09.883 --> 31:11.567
The Chechens
are near Aina Alley,

31:11.601 --> 31:13.602
northwest corner of the market.

31:13.637 --> 31:15.888
Danny, you and Sam are closest.

31:15.906 --> 31:17.823
They're coming toward you

31:17.858 --> 31:20.192
right about now.

31:22.078 --> 31:23.829
All right, there they are.

31:23.864 --> 31:26.415
Let's go.

31:26.450 --> 31:27.867
Hold on. There's Comescu.

31:27.901 --> 31:29.084
He's over
by the jewelry vendors.

31:29.119 --> 31:32.221
I got him.

31:35.292 --> 31:37.092
He's not carrying
anything.

31:37.127 --> 31:38.577
Where are
the smallpox vials?

31:38.612 --> 31:40.713
The buy already happened.

31:42.165 --> 31:44.133
If it did,
the smallpox is in that bag,

31:44.184 --> 31:46.435
Well, then we got to
take them now; let's go.

31:46.470 --> 31:48.187
Hey, how you doing, man?

31:49.406 --> 31:50.506
Come on, Frankie.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.224
Take a walk.
Oh, Frankie, baby,

31:52.258 --> 31:54.443
you got to lay off
the mai-tais.

32:02.402 --> 32:04.820
Don't move.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.210
All right,

32:11.244 --> 32:12.828
Chechens are in custody.

32:12.879 --> 32:13.879
The cash is
still with them.

32:13.914 --> 32:15.498
The buy hasn't happened yet;
I repeat:

32:15.549 --> 32:17.666
The buy is still in play.

32:17.701 --> 32:19.718
There.

32:19.753 --> 32:22.371
That's Dracul's bodyguard.

32:22.405 --> 32:24.557
Vials must be in the case.

32:28.011 --> 32:29.795
They're getting spooked.

32:29.813 --> 32:31.313
We got to move on this.

32:31.348 --> 32:33.131
All right, we're moving in.

32:33.149 --> 32:35.768
Dracul Comescu,
hold it right there.

32:36.937 --> 32:38.821
Get down! Down! Down!

32:38.855 --> 32:39.488
Chin?

32:39.523 --> 32:41.140
Chin, what's going on?

32:41.174 --> 32:41.824
Chin?

32:41.858 --> 32:43.292
Comescu's running.

32:44.244 --> 32:45.494
Get down now!

33:02.613 --> 33:04.326
Kono, you got
eyes on them?

33:04.328 --> 33:06.045
Stand by.

33:07.998 --> 33:10.533
Yes. Bodyguard.

33:10.567 --> 33:12.868
He's near the food vendors.

33:12.902 --> 33:15.204
I don't see Comescu;
I think they split up.

33:16.540 --> 33:17.790
There's Dracul.
Go.

33:17.841 --> 33:19.592
Chin, behind you!

33:19.626 --> 33:21.677
Freeze! Five-O!

33:21.712 --> 33:22.911
I will kill her.

33:22.929 --> 33:24.930
Let her go.
Drop your weapon now

33:24.965 --> 33:26.465
or she dies.

33:26.516 --> 33:27.750
Let her go!

33:29.186 --> 33:30.886
All right.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.272
I'm dropping my weapon,
all right?

33:33.306 --> 33:34.590
I'm dropping my weapon.

33:36.893 --> 33:40.179
Nice shot, cuz!

33:44.117 --> 33:46.101
No sign of the briefcase.

33:46.119 --> 33:47.620
Comescu must have it.

The vials you recovered

did not contain smallpox.

37:50.447 --> 37:51.346
They were saline.

37:51.364 --> 37:52.531
The virus is still out there.

37:52.565 --> 37:54.033
Comescu thought
that it was smallpox, okay?

37:54.067 --> 37:55.701
He was ready
to break the thing open

37:55.735 --> 37:57.352
in public
just to expose Callen.

37:57.370 --> 37:58.687
Somebody had to switch
the vials.

37:58.722 --> 38:00.039
I think I know who.

38:00.073 --> 38:01.740
The doctor who was running
the experiment.

Don't move, okay?

We got to go.

<i>His name is</i>

38:09.633 --> 38:10.783
Dr. Jarrod Prodeman.

38:10.817 --> 38:12.801
He's a formerly highly respected
epidemiologist.

38:12.836 --> 38:15.871
I was able to match his voice
from the experiment video

38:15.889 --> 38:17.740
with some old lectures
posted online.

38:17.774 --> 38:19.124
Why formerly respected?

38:19.159 --> 38:20.693
Well, evidently he was disgraced

38:20.727 --> 38:23.045
after he faked some data
to obtain a research grant,

38:23.063 --> 38:24.346
and he hasn't been able
to work since.

38:24.380 --> 38:25.380
Great. So he decides

38:25.398 --> 38:27.349
to start making
biological weapons. Perfect.

38:27.383 --> 38:29.384
So Comescu gets the smallpox
in Russia,

38:29.402 --> 38:30.736
gives it to Prodeman to modify,

38:30.770 --> 38:33.188
but Prodeman double-crosses him
and keeps it for himself.

38:33.222 --> 38:35.324
But why double-cross
the guys he's working for?

38:35.358 --> 38:36.592
Maybe he found another buyer.

38:37.661 --> 38:40.112

38:40.163 --> 38:42.881
Hey, guys, don't come to HQ.

the guy before.

40:25.852 --> 40:26.718
He came up to me
at the gate

40:26.770 --> 40:28.137
and asked me to switch
flights with him.

40:28.171 --> 40:30.139
Right, and I'm sure
you did it just out of

40:30.173 --> 40:31.974
the kindness
of your heart.

40:32.008 --> 40:34.476
Well, that
and he-he gave me $500.

40:34.510 --> 40:36.528
He had some
sob story about

40:36.563 --> 40:37.780
his girlfriend being
on an earlier flight.

40:37.814 --> 40:39.364
She was scared
to fly without him.

40:39.399 --> 40:41.450
He was traveling with a woman?

40:41.484 --> 40:42.484
Yeah.

40:42.518 --> 40:44.319
Uh, the game was on at the bar,

40:44.354 --> 40:46.071

do the guy a solid,

40:46.122 --> 40:47.372

40:47.407 --> 40:48.574
