00:36.360 --> 00:38.400
You know the problem with Hollywood?

00:38.600 --> 00:42.720
They make shit. Unbelievable,
unremarkable shit.

00:42.920 --> 00:45.440
I'm not some wannabe filmmaker...

00:45.640 --> 00:49.320
...searching for existentialism through
a haze of bong smoke.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.800
No, it's easy to pick apart bad acting,
shortsighted directing...

00:53.000 --> 00:56.800
...and a moronic stringing together
of words the studios term as prose.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.960
No, I'm talking about
the lack of realism. Realism.

01:01.160 --> 01:05.000
Not a pervasive element
in modern American cinematic vision.

01:05.880 --> 01:10.760
Take Dog Day Afternoon, for example.
Arguably Pacino's best work.

01:10.920 --> 01:15.360
Short of Scarface and
Godfather Part I, of course.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.760
Masterpiece of directing,
easily Lumet's best.

01:20.200 --> 01:25.080
The cinematography, the acting,
the screenplay, all topnotch. But...

01:32.640 --> 01:35.400
...they didn't push the envelope.

01:36.000 --> 01:41.120
What if, in Dog Day Sonny wanted to
get away with it? Really wanted that.

01:42.200 --> 01:46.560
Now this is the tricky part. What if
he started killing hostages right away?

01:46.760 --> 01:48.520
No mercy, no quarter.

01:49.200 --> 01:54.560
"Meet our demands or the pretty blond
gets it in the head." Bam, splat.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.320
What, still no bus? Come on.

01:57.680 --> 02:01.120
How many innocent victims would it take
for the city...

02:01.320 --> 02:03.680
...to reverse its policy
on hostages?

02:03.920 --> 02:08.919
And this is 1966. There's no CNN.
There's no CNBC. There's no Internet.

02:10.840 --> 02:14.640
Fast-forward to today.
Present time, same situation.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.320
How quickly would the media
make a frenzy? In hours.

02:18.520 --> 02:22.200
It would be the biggest story from
Boston to Budapest.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.040
Ten hostages die.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.360
Twenty, thirty.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.400
Relentless. Bam, bim.
One after another.

02:31.440 --> 02:37.200
All on hi-def, computer-enhanced.
You can almost taste the brain matter.

02:37.440 --> 02:40.120
All for what? A bus, a plane?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.840
A couple million dollars
that's federally insured?

02:48.520 --> 02:50.320
I don't think so, but...

02:50.640 --> 02:52.440
...just a thought.

02:53.160 --> 02:54.920
I mean, it's not...

02:55.880 --> 02:59.200
...within the realm of
conventional cinema, but...

03:01.960 --> 03:03.400
...what if?

03:05.760 --> 03:09.400
- There's a problem with that movie.
- Really?

03:09.600 --> 03:12.600
- It wouldn't work.
- How come?

03:13.280 --> 03:17.720
- Audiences love happy endings.
- Pacino escapes with the money.

03:17.920 --> 03:21.720
Boyfriend gets a sex change.
Live happily ever after.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.800
- No?
- No.

03:25.280 --> 03:26.720
Homophobia.

03:26.920 --> 03:29.720
Bad guy can't win.
It's a morality tale.

03:29.920 --> 03:32.920
One way or the other,
he's gotta go down.

03:35.040 --> 03:39.600
Well, life is stranger
than fiction sometimes.

03:45.960 --> 03:49.280
You know, guys, I gotta go.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.200
Gotta jet.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.720
Thanks for the coffee.

04:03.080 --> 04:07.080
Stan. Time to go to work.
You coming?

04:10.960 --> 04:13.920
Move. I won't say it again.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.440
I have a clear shot.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.640
Shooters, stand by.

04:58.600 --> 05:00.520
Okay. Now what?

05:01.680 --> 05:04.160
Don't worry, folks, it's almost over.
Is she done?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.240
- She's done.
- Move her out.

05:08.600 --> 05:13.200
Don't worry, you'll be fine.
You'll be back before you know it.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.800
Turn the fuck around.

05:20.880 --> 05:23.840
Rescue team, let's go.
Who's on the roof?

05:24.040 --> 05:27.160
All shooters, you are holding
for command.

05:30.640 --> 05:34.760
You're doing good. Behave yourself.
Look over there, and there.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.560
All prepare their shot.

05:36.800 --> 05:39.720
- What are you doing?
- I'm handling this!

05:39.960 --> 05:42.960
Don't fuck with this guy!
You'll get these people killed!

05:43.160 --> 05:46.600
We got two teams on the roof.
We got a team over there.

05:46.800 --> 05:49.560
Double this team up.
That's your best angle.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.800
Don't talk. Just listen.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.760
Each of the 22 hostages is wrapped
with 20 pounds of C-4 explosives.

05:56.960 --> 06:01.080
They're also taped with 15 pounds
of stainless steel ball bearings.

06:01.280 --> 06:04.480
Which makes them the world's
largest claymore mines.

06:04.640 --> 06:06.560
They got the green light.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.960
I got this guy on the phone!

06:09.120 --> 06:11.720
I'm done playing with this asshole!

06:12.160 --> 06:16.960
Around their necks are radio-frequency
electronic dog collars.

06:17.160 --> 06:21.320
Dog walks out of the yard, gets the
shit shocked out of him. Same here.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.640
This bank is their yard,
so don't fuck with me.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.760
Johnson, you and your partner move up
between those vehicles.

06:31.480 --> 06:34.160
- Stand down!
- Get back!

06:34.360 --> 06:36.680
- Get back!
- Officer, stand down now!

06:40.440 --> 06:42.680
He's gonna shoot!
He's gonna shoot!

06:46.400 --> 06:47.400
Shit.

06:49.800 --> 06:50.840
Get her!

06:51.080 --> 06:52.080
Go!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.400
No! Release the hostage!

06:54.680 --> 06:56.840
No! Release the hostage!

06:57.120 --> 06:59.360
She's gone. Take cover!

07:02.920 --> 07:05.840
No, no! Let her go!
Let her go!

07:06.440 --> 07:08.160
Release the hostage!

07:10.240 --> 07:11.880
Help me!

07:12.440 --> 07:14.240
Let her go. Let her go!

07:16.800 --> 07:19.200
- Jesus.
- Shit! You guys, come on!

08:25.240 --> 08:28.160
- How long will you be here?
- One week.

08:28.320 --> 08:31.480
- Business or pleasure?
- Hopefully both.

08:31.680 --> 08:35.080
- What type of work do you do?
- I'm a consultant.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.159
Excuse me.

08:40.360 --> 08:44.840
Could you be careful with that?
That's expensive equipment.

09:03.480 --> 09:05.800
- How long will this take?
- A few minutes.

09:06.000 --> 09:08.560
Sit down, relax.
I'll be right back.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.520
A few minutes, huh?

09:41.440 --> 09:43.280
Hey, where's he going?

09:46.520 --> 09:48.760
It's going up. Stairs.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.800
Sir, could you please--?

10:19.440 --> 10:20.880
Easy, easy.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.080
This better be important.

10:25.240 --> 10:27.960
Wouldn't have asked you
otherwise, senator.

10:29.560 --> 10:34.520
We just received word that Axl Torvalds
was intercepted entering the U.S.

10:34.720 --> 10:37.680
- When was this?
- Within the last two hours.

10:37.880 --> 10:41.880
According to my FBI source,
he was nabbed in customs at LAX.

10:42.080 --> 10:44.680
- They know he's working for us?
- It's unlikely.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.480
It was a routine check.
Torvalds freaked out. They got lucky.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.080
This ain't good.
What do the feds know?

10:51.280 --> 10:53.920
Nothing yet.
He's refusing to speak English.

10:54.080 --> 10:57.240
The Finnish consulate has contacted
the State Department.

10:57.440 --> 11:02.480
- So we haven't been compromised?
- I'm not sure. I'm working on that.

11:02.640 --> 11:07.360
You better get sure because someone's
cock will end up on the block...

11:07.520 --> 11:09.400
...and it won't be mine.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.760
I understand, senator.

11:13.920 --> 11:15.600
There you go.

11:54.240 --> 11:55.320
Well, well, well.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.000
Who are you supposed to be?

12:03.840 --> 12:06.800
- I'm Ginger.
- Ginger, huh?

12:07.520 --> 12:09.320
Where's Gilligan?

12:13.720 --> 12:18.800
For someone the NSA once listed as the
most dangerous hacker in America...

12:19.000 --> 12:21.680
...you sure don't look like much.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.400
Surprised?

12:24.640 --> 12:27.000
I know everything about you, Stan.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.400
What are you selling again?

12:34.920 --> 12:37.280
My employer wants to meet you.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.120
- Shit.
- You're not too good at golf.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.400
You're fucking up my chi.

12:44.360 --> 12:45.800
Let me have that.

13:11.800 --> 13:15.440
This is not a nice place
you got here, Stan.

13:19.840 --> 13:23.760
Here 5 minutes, and I already
feel sorry for myself.

13:24.160 --> 13:28.640
You're wasting your time. I touch
a computer, I go back to Leavenworth.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.520
Do not pass Go, do not collect $200.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.120
If I knew you were coming,
I might have cleaned up.

13:40.480 --> 13:43.720
I'm not here to suck
your dick, Stanley.

13:53.080 --> 13:55.840
He'll pay you just to meet you.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.720
I gotta go to work.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.320
Right.

14:08.520 --> 14:11.480
Great work greasing pump jacks.

14:15.960 --> 14:17.520
So...

14:18.520 --> 14:20.680
...spoke to Holly lately?

14:27.920 --> 14:29.360
Shit!

14:45.840 --> 14:46.800
Hello?

14:47.280 --> 14:50.240
Melissa. Is Holly home?

14:53.760 --> 14:55.800
Why are you calling here?

14:56.880 --> 15:01.600
- I just want to talk with Holly.
- It's Saturday. She's at soccer.

15:03.840 --> 15:06.360
It's illegal for you to talk to her.

15:06.560 --> 15:10.400
Don't do this, Mel.
It's not good for Holly.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.920
How would you know
what's good for my daughter?

15:14.080 --> 15:16.800
You spent the last two years
in prison.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.440
- Mel.
- Stop calling me that, Stanley.

15:20.640 --> 15:24.280
Look, I just...
I just want to see my baby.

15:25.520 --> 15:28.440
Well, she doesn't want
to see you, Stanley.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.480
And I swear, if you try
to contact her...

15:31.680 --> 15:34.480
...I'll have you thrown
in a hole so dark...

15:34.720 --> 15:37.360
...Leavenworth will seem like
two weeks in Vegas...

15:37.600 --> 15:39.880
...during which I will personally...

15:40.080 --> 15:43.840
...pay two skinheads to
make a playground out of your ass.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.080
You can take the girl out of
the trailer park...

15:46.280 --> 15:48.560
...but can't take the trailer park
out of the girl.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.560
I will not let myself be manipulated
by you, Stanley.

15:53.600 --> 15:54.960
Larry's her father now.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.840
Larry's the porn king of
Southern Calif--

15:58.040 --> 16:00.760
Larry is a film financier.

16:00.960 --> 16:05.440
The films he chooses are for profit
and none of your business.

16:05.640 --> 16:10.320
Get help. Get into a program,
get a therapist, get a dog.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.440
But whatever you do,
stay away from my child.

16:13.640 --> 16:18.760
- Your child? She's our child.
- She will never be your child.

16:18.960 --> 16:20.760
Forget Holly.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.520
What are you still doing here?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.560
Look, I'm beginning to
lose my sense of humor.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.480
Then I'll cut to the chase.

16:38.680 --> 16:42.120
If you want your daughter back,
you better listen up.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.680
Unless you want to stay here
in this loser existence...

16:46.880 --> 16:52.360
...while your daughter grows up to be a
fluffer in her new daddy's videos.

16:52.960 --> 16:57.440
Please don't confuse your own childhood
with my daughter's.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.840
And look at your situation, Stanley.

17:00.040 --> 17:04.839
For the past 20 months, you've
been in and out of court 6 times?

17:05.079 --> 17:07.640
Each time your case was thrown out.

17:09.880 --> 17:13.160
Situation doesn't
look good, sweetheart.

17:14.720 --> 17:19.400
How much money would it cost to hire
the best family lawyer in the country?

17:19.960 --> 17:21.560
A lot. Come here.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.800
Come here.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.480
Judas.

17:30.880 --> 17:33.080
That should get you started.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.360
Hundred grand.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.000
What do you got to lose?
He just wants to meet you.

17:47.640 --> 17:50.760
One time.
You don't like the situation...

17:51.080 --> 17:52.600
...walk away.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.440
- And that's it?
- That's it. And you keep the money.

18:06.600 --> 18:08.200
What did he say?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.400
All right, look, look.

18:13.320 --> 18:17.240
Your client is wanted on 24 counts of
electronic crimes...

18:17.440 --> 18:19.480
...in 6 different countries.

18:19.680 --> 18:21.480
He has a Finnish passport.

18:21.720 --> 18:26.880
These allegations are not recognized
as crimes. Your laws don't apply.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.320
Do you see a Finnish flag hanging
on the wall, IKEA boy?

18:37.600 --> 18:40.880
- What did he say?
- He said IKEA is Swedish.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.040
He understands English, huh?

18:45.280 --> 18:48.440
- Let me talk to him.
- He's all yours.

18:49.640 --> 18:51.680
You're fucked up now, Hamlet.

18:55.800 --> 18:59.960
The thing is, they have you put
the furniture together yourself.

19:01.200 --> 19:05.040
My client has reserved his right
not to answer any questions.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.600
Why would the best hacker
in the world...

19:07.800 --> 19:11.800
...risk life imprisonment by coming
into the continental U.S.?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.160
Okay, what did he just say?

19:16.360 --> 19:19.320
He never misses an episode
of Survivor.

19:20.040 --> 19:21.600
Did he really say that?

19:25.880 --> 19:27.600
You're funny.

19:29.880 --> 19:33.440
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?

19:39.680 --> 19:41.800
We'll call you if we need you.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.920
Eat a dick.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.760
Wipe that smile off your face.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.520
A year ago, I was head of the largest
cyber-criminal task force in the world.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.400
But I burned out.

20:18.680 --> 20:20.280
I snapped.

20:21.600 --> 20:24.280
I shot a suspect in the hand.

20:26.520 --> 20:30.600
You know how difficult it is to work
a keyboard with one hand?

20:30.880 --> 20:36.640
You don't understand. Whatever you
want to do to me, he'll do worse.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.800
I'm already dead.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.440
My only chance is back in Europe.
I have friends there.

20:44.800 --> 20:46.720
Tell me what I want to know.

20:46.880 --> 20:50.520
You'll be on the first thing smoking.
First class.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.080
Courtesy of the U.S. government.

20:53.440 --> 20:54.920
Who is he?

20:56.960 --> 21:01.160
- I don't know his name.
- You work for him. You don't know?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.920
Tell me something.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.600
I'll tell you what I know.

21:18.480 --> 21:22.160
He exists in a world
beyond your world.

21:32.160 --> 21:35.160
What we only fantasize, he does.

21:35.640 --> 21:39.040
He lives a life
where nothing is beyond him.

21:47.920 --> 21:51.000
But you know what?
It's all a facade.

21:53.120 --> 21:57.800
For all his charm and charisma,
his wealth, his expensive toys...

21:58.040 --> 22:02.920
...he is a driven, unflinching,
calculating machine.

22:04.040 --> 22:07.160
He takes what he wants,
when he wants...

22:07.680 --> 22:09.440
...and disappears.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.200
So how do I find him?

22:13.920 --> 22:16.520
You don't find him. He finds you.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.640
Here's how it works.

22:21.080 --> 22:23.480
His people pick me up.
Take me to him.

22:23.680 --> 22:26.240
He tells me what he wants me to do.

22:26.720 --> 22:29.080
I do the job right there.

22:30.120 --> 22:32.160
I get paid, and I leave.

22:36.520 --> 22:41.320
That's a really nice story, but you
haven't told me shit, have you?

22:42.800 --> 22:46.320
- Excuse me, sir. You have a call.
- Take a message.

22:46.520 --> 22:50.360
It's assistant director Joy.
He said it's important.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.760
I can only tell you
what I've done for him.

22:59.840 --> 23:01.440
Well, that's a start.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.640
Thank you. You've just
let my client go free.

23:07.800 --> 23:11.120
- You denied his right to counsel--
- Excuse me.

23:12.560 --> 23:14.680
Yeah, and you eat the dick!

23:32.640 --> 23:36.280
Yes, I got a call from A.D. Joy.
This is Roberts.

23:36.640 --> 23:38.840
Hold for just one moment, sir.

24:19.360 --> 24:22.360
- Joy.
- Yeah, Roberts. You needed me.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.320
You didn't call?

24:33.920 --> 24:36.120
No, Roberts. What do you want?

24:49.880 --> 24:52.920
You should've let me
buy you a suit, Stanley.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.800
I'm happy with what I'm wearing.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.880
Ignorance is bliss.

25:34.560 --> 25:35.840
Miss me?

25:36.400 --> 25:39.480
- Stanley, Gabriel.
- Big Stan.

25:39.680 --> 25:41.520
- Nice suit.
- Thanks.

25:42.080 --> 25:45.720
- They say the clothes make the man.
- You buy it?

25:46.240 --> 25:48.040
Hope not. Drink?

25:49.920 --> 25:54.280
I flew 1500 miles for this meeting.
How about we get to the point?

25:54.480 --> 25:58.560
No. Actually, you flew 1500 miles
for 100 grand.

25:58.760 --> 26:02.840
But that's not the point.
Helga. Meet Stanley.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.200
- Hello, Stanley.
- Helga.

26:07.520 --> 26:10.720
Look, I don't have
a lot of patience, Gabriel.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.360
Maybe you can help me with something.

26:18.280 --> 26:19.840
Take a look at this.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.360
You know I can't touch that.

26:27.600 --> 26:29.520
Do you like tequila, Stanley?

26:41.800 --> 26:43.080
This is bullshit.

26:43.320 --> 26:46.240
You want something from me,
and I from you.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.040
DOD d-base, 128-bit encryption.
What do you think?

26:50.240 --> 26:52.440
- Impossible?
- Nothing's impossible.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.280
Good. Maybe slide in
a Trojan horse hiding a worm?

26:56.480 --> 26:59.640
- Is this an interview?
- Sort of. Marco.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.400
Give him some incentive.

27:03.200 --> 27:07.040
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Relax, Stanley.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.280
I have been told that
the best crackers in the world...

27:19.520 --> 27:21.640
...can do this in 60 minutes.

27:21.960 --> 27:25.280
Unfortunately, I need someone
to do it in 60 seconds.

27:25.520 --> 27:26.600
You're kidding.

27:26.720 --> 27:28.920
Afraid not. Go.

27:30.520 --> 27:31.480
Get up, get up!

27:33.480 --> 27:35.600
- Fifty-five.
- Get on with it.

27:35.800 --> 27:40.240
- What the hell is this?
- Time's a-wasting, big guy.

27:41.080 --> 27:42.760
Oh, Jesus.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.520
Forty-five seconds.

27:59.520 --> 28:01.560
Oh, she's good, isn't she?

28:02.400 --> 28:05.160
What's going on here?
Jesus Christ.

28:08.920 --> 28:11.640
- More time, more time!
- Come on, Stan!

28:13.600 --> 28:15.960
Twenty. Nineteen.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.280
Fifteen.

28:27.920 --> 28:29.160
Come on.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.480
Ten. Nine.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.080
Three.

28:42.320 --> 28:44.240
Two. One.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.280
- Too bad. You gotta die.
- No, wait!

28:54.600 --> 28:56.960
I was just fucking with you, Stan.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.720
That's our guy.

29:33.720 --> 29:37.320
- Get away from me.
- I really want to help you, Stan.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.640
Like you helped me in there?

29:43.880 --> 29:46.040
- That was a test, Stan.
- A test.

29:46.240 --> 29:47.320
And you passed.

29:47.520 --> 29:50.480
I don't know why I let you
talk me into this.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.440
You're saving your daughter.

29:52.640 --> 29:57.080
I'd do anything for her, but if
I end up in a box or in jail...

29:57.240 --> 29:59.320
...then I really can't help her.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.480
I'm taking my money
and going back to court!

30:02.680 --> 30:04.680
With your little $100,000?

30:04.920 --> 30:08.040
Melissa will throw $500,000
back at you. Think!

30:08.280 --> 30:12.760
I'm thinking that you'll put a gun
to my head just to see if I can--

30:16.800 --> 30:19.160
I can't pee in front of an audience.

30:32.320 --> 30:35.760
Let me break it down to you, Stanley,
one last time.

30:35.960 --> 30:37.840
You live in a trailer.

30:38.040 --> 30:41.360
You're a felon.
You work a dead-end job.

30:41.560 --> 30:44.600
And you desperately want
your daughter back.

30:44.800 --> 30:47.880
Gabriel is your only shot.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.880
Take it.

30:51.040 --> 30:56.280
- I'm concerned about our new friend.
- Oh, now, don't be jealous.

30:56.800 --> 31:00.440
I don't see him dragging his sorry ass
over the finish line.

31:00.640 --> 31:03.800
- Thought we lost you.
- Tell me what the deal is.

31:04.000 --> 31:08.120
The deal is that we're having
a little gathering at the house.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.080
Come and I'll explain it to you there.

31:14.840 --> 31:18.240
Gentlemen, if it's not good news,
don't say it.

31:18.440 --> 31:22.840
Actually, we have a ray of hope
in the darkness of your life.

31:23.040 --> 31:27.800
When we grabbed Torvalds at the
airport, these two guys were there.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.560
Check this out.

31:30.400 --> 31:33.680
Recognize those two same guys,
a few hours later.

31:33.920 --> 31:35.560
And then...

31:36.640 --> 31:38.360
...guess who shows up.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.800
Stanley Jobson.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.440
Wired magazine's 1996
Man of the Year.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.760
A burnout now, but the
hacker Zeitgeist then.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.640
Yeah, I know Jobson, I arrested him.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.160
Why are you in L.A., Stan?

31:57.600 --> 32:00.120
His ex-wife and daughter
live in Malibu.

32:00.320 --> 32:05.440
The new husband owns Backdoor Films,
a shady porn production house.

32:05.640 --> 32:08.960
The production value's good,
considering that they shoot on video.

32:09.160 --> 32:13.720
- His wife is in some of the videos.
- I know. She's like an actress.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.360
That's great. Are you done?

32:16.720 --> 32:18.200
Who's the girl?

32:20.040 --> 32:22.600
Actually, sir, we don't know yet.

32:24.160 --> 32:29.080
- She's a serious piece of talent.
- Man, she's way out of his league.

32:30.880 --> 32:32.640
Find out who she is.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.560
- Sit on the ex-wife's house.
- You got it.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.560
Stanley, you want to get wet?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.400
- I don't have a suit.
- You don't need one.

32:51.600 --> 32:53.520
- Come on, Stan.
- Later.

32:55.160 --> 32:59.200
- Some view. Let's get a drink.
- Pool lights on.

33:13.720 --> 33:15.320
- So how did you do it?
- Do what?

33:15.520 --> 33:16.680
Break the code.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.520
I dropped a logic bomb
through the trap door.

33:19.760 --> 33:22.360
No, you didn't.
You didn't have time.

33:23.040 --> 33:25.080
- What'll you have?
- Scotch.

33:25.280 --> 33:29.120
- You can do better than that.
- I used a password sniffer.

33:30.400 --> 33:32.400
How did you do it?

33:32.720 --> 33:37.120
I don't know exactly. I see the code
in my head. I can't explain it.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.960
Let me show you something.

33:53.160 --> 33:55.080
Pretty impressive, huh?

33:58.920 --> 34:03.000
So, what we need from you is a worm.
A hydra, actually.

34:03.200 --> 34:07.640
A multiheaded worm to sniff out digital
footprints across an encrypted network.

34:08.639 --> 34:11.719
- What kind of cipher?
- A Vernam encryption.

34:12.800 --> 34:15.400
The key code is destroyed
upon implementation.

34:15.600 --> 34:18.199
And it's a true 128-bit encryption.

34:18.400 --> 34:21.560
Well, actually,
we're talking a 512-bit.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.800
- That's definitely not possible.
- What if I give you 10 million dollars?

34:29.199 --> 34:32.080
That would cover all your problems.
Yes?

34:32.280 --> 34:35.520
Unless, of course, it's not possible.

34:35.719 --> 34:38.480
But you think about it.

34:47.760 --> 34:50.159
It won't bite you. I promise.

34:56.159 --> 35:01.480
This is not just a multi-screen system.
It has a DS-3 connection.

35:01.680 --> 35:04.960
We can access 6 different networks
simultaneously.

35:08.920 --> 35:13.640
It has a central encryption you
have to crack to utilize the system.

35:13.880 --> 35:14.800
Try it.

35:15.040 --> 35:17.720
It'll be hard without a gun
to my head.

35:17.920 --> 35:20.320
Maybe I should put a gun to your head.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.720
I thought you were Gabriel's.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.840
- I'm not what you think I am.
- Ginger.

35:38.480 --> 35:43.120
You surprised that a girl with
an IQ over 60 can give you a hard-on?

35:49.720 --> 35:52.280
So is it impossible?

35:53.160 --> 35:54.840
Nothing's impossible.

35:55.280 --> 35:56.920
Good. So we have a deal.

36:30.600 --> 36:33.680
- Morning.
- You mean afternoon?

36:41.280 --> 36:44.160
Can I borrow your car for something?

36:44.480 --> 36:45.920
Sure.

36:46.600 --> 36:48.360
- There you go.
- Thank you.

36:49.120 --> 36:53.160
Hey, Stan, if you're going
to see Holly...

36:53.360 --> 36:56.720
...I suggest you re-evaluate
the way you look.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.200
Just a thought.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.360
Just a thought.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.800
Come on, Mom, pick up.

38:10.120 --> 38:13.440
- Mom late again?
- She'll be here in a minute.

38:20.280 --> 38:24.920
Hi. Can I have the phone number for
Yellow Cab?

38:25.120 --> 38:26.360
Need a lift?

38:28.600 --> 38:30.000
Daddy!

38:31.440 --> 38:33.840
Oh, what are you doing here?

38:36.440 --> 38:40.160
- I missed you so much.
- Oh, I missed you too, baby.

38:40.400 --> 38:45.120
- I brought you something.
- Oh, my gosh. It's so cute.

38:45.800 --> 38:50.200
Oh, Dad. If Mom finds out,
she'll have you thrown in jail.

38:50.400 --> 38:52.760
It's okay, baby.
You want a lift home?

38:52.960 --> 38:56.400
- Of course I do.
- Come here. All right.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.760
You are heavy.

39:00.360 --> 39:03.160
- Nice car.
- Hey, thanks.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.720
Is that Mommy's car?
Is she home?

39:09.200 --> 39:11.320
That's my step-dad's car.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.800
So listen to me.

39:18.720 --> 39:21.320
I found a way for us to be together.

39:26.680 --> 39:29.480
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

39:29.680 --> 39:31.400
Everything's going to be fine.

39:34.720 --> 39:37.960
Everything's going to be okay.
Just trust me.

39:40.160 --> 39:43.160
- I love you, Daddy.
- I love you. Come here.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.880
Oh, God.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.280
You go home. Okay? Bye.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.880
- I miss you.
- I miss you too. Go.

39:58.560 --> 40:00.120
Oh, sweetheart.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.080
Hey.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.360
Come here.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.160
It's okay. Go. Go.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.120
Go.

40:33.920 --> 40:35.600
Who the hell are you?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.880
- A friend of a friend.
- Shit.

40:39.880 --> 40:41.840
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

40:50.280 --> 40:51.480
Hold it! Stanley!

40:57.680 --> 40:58.640
Go!

41:34.640 --> 41:35.960
Oh, fuck.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.120
Oh, fuck!

42:26.000 --> 42:27.440
Don't move!

42:29.240 --> 42:30.680
Don't move.

42:30.960 --> 42:32.400
Come here.

42:39.160 --> 42:40.760
Look at this.

42:41.240 --> 42:43.240
What were you running for?

42:43.960 --> 42:46.040
You arresting me?

42:46.240 --> 42:50.760
For violating your parole
by leaving Texas without permission?

42:51.000 --> 42:55.640
Or evading an officer and almost
getting me killed in the process?!

42:57.600 --> 42:59.960
No, I'm not arresting you.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.800
Then why are we talking?

43:03.440 --> 43:05.720
- What are you doing in L.A.?
- Vacationing.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.560
Vacationing, right.

43:09.400 --> 43:12.160
The judge is allowing you to
see your daughter?

43:12.360 --> 43:14.160
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you? Oh?

43:14.360 --> 43:19.320
You just want to get right down to it?
Okay, fine.

43:20.960 --> 43:23.400
I can help you with your daughter.

43:25.120 --> 43:27.320
You help me, I'll help you.

43:27.840 --> 43:30.520
You'll have to forgive me.
The fact that...

43:30.720 --> 43:33.720
...you put me in jail
doesn't inspire trust.

43:33.920 --> 43:37.280
You put a virus in an FBI program
and set it back two years.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.560
They were reading ISP subscribers'
e-mail. It was illegal.

43:40.800 --> 43:44.520
- I did what the judges wouldn't do!
- You broke the law!

43:44.760 --> 43:50.000
We both did what we had to do.
And your program is back in full swing.

43:51.560 --> 43:55.320
Nice trip down memory lane,
but if you aren't arresting me--

43:59.680 --> 44:02.600
Not getting a lot of cooperation here.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.480
I ran into your friend Torvalds
the other day.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.680
He was vacationing too.

44:09.280 --> 44:12.920
What are the odds of you
being in L.A. at the same time?

44:13.600 --> 44:15.760
I'm just a sucker for Disneyland.

44:17.920 --> 44:19.320
We done?

44:19.920 --> 44:21.240
Good.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.800
Tell Torvalds I said hello.

44:24.000 --> 44:27.840
You can tell him yourself
if you're not careful. He's dead.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.760
Give me a card.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.840
You think of anything to say,
call me.

44:35.520 --> 44:37.880
Sorry about your nose.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.360
- You're in way over your head.
- I know.

44:48.800 --> 44:52.120
- You want me to watch him?
- Yeah, set it up.

45:17.400 --> 45:21.360
I've had a shitty day so far,
but I think it just got worse.

45:35.800 --> 45:39.960
Either shoot me, or tell me why
you're wearing that wire.

45:40.360 --> 45:41.840
Can't do that.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.760
Who are you, Ginger?

45:45.240 --> 45:46.840
I can't tell you.

45:48.160 --> 45:50.560
Who are you?

45:51.400 --> 45:53.360
He'll kill me if he finds out.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.760
That's not my problem, is it?

45:57.160 --> 46:00.840
You're asking for a lot of faith
without giving me any.

46:16.320 --> 46:18.560
You brought me into this mess.

46:19.520 --> 46:22.080
I deserve to know who's playing me.

46:24.680 --> 46:26.480
Who are you?

46:32.760 --> 46:34.360
I'm DEA, Stanley.

46:34.560 --> 46:35.800
Holy shit.

46:36.280 --> 46:39.040
We're after Gabriel.
Give him the worm...

46:39.240 --> 46:42.760
...take the money and get out of here.
That's all.

46:47.520 --> 46:49.080
This looks friendly.

46:52.600 --> 46:55.320
You know me, I'm a friendly girl.

46:57.280 --> 47:00.040
Come on, Stanley. Let's get coffee.

47:20.440 --> 47:21.800
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

47:22.520 --> 47:24.920
- Ever heard of Operation Swordfish?
- No.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.520
Then you'll appreciate the irony.

47:27.680 --> 47:28.760
Triple espresso.

47:30.200 --> 47:32.160
- Two.
- Okay.

47:32.760 --> 47:36.640
In the '80s, the DEA set up a
network of dummy corporations...

47:36.840 --> 47:40.600
...as a front to launder drug money
and gather evidence.

47:41.080 --> 47:44.600
But these companies
started to make a lot of money.

47:44.800 --> 47:49.600
In 1986, when it was terminated,
$400 million was in these accounts.

47:49.800 --> 47:52.600
Money that just sort of disappeared.

47:53.720 --> 47:57.080
It didn't disappear.
It sat, earning interest.

47:57.280 --> 48:01.800
That's 15 years ago. You know
how much money that is today?

48:04.200 --> 48:06.000
Nine and a half billion.

48:09.160 --> 48:13.880
This is a sweet deal. We go in over
the phone lines, pop the firewall...

48:14.080 --> 48:17.120
...drop in the hydra
and wait for the money.

48:17.840 --> 48:20.240
Aren't you getting ahead of yourself?

48:20.600 --> 48:25.080
To access the cluster, you need a bank
on the backbone of the network.

48:25.280 --> 48:30.360
- Know how long that'll take to find?
- Not a problem. Look behind you.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.320
Cheers.

48:56.840 --> 48:59.240
These fellows might wear Armani...

48:59.400 --> 49:02.760
...but they have the swagger
of ex-military.

49:04.000 --> 49:07.160
Maybe bodyguards,
but they look like mercs to me.

49:07.360 --> 49:12.120
Something's going on. They have two
DS-3 trucks. That's serious bandwidth.

49:12.320 --> 49:16.200
Thermal scopes show a huge heat load.
Could be mainframes.

49:16.400 --> 49:19.520
The house was listed
by Celebrity Estates.

49:19.880 --> 49:23.040
It was leased two weeks ago
by a blind corporation.

49:23.240 --> 49:25.160
No other info on them yet.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.240
Wait a minute, Joe.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.840
Blue shirt, pinstripe.

49:36.400 --> 49:37.880
Oh, yeah, that's him.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.280
That's our man right there.

49:49.920 --> 49:53.080
Just in time to watch Stanley
find our worm.

49:54.240 --> 49:58.120
In college, I created the source code
for the worm I use.

50:01.600 --> 50:06.200
In the basement is the only PDP-10
still active and on the Internet.

50:06.400 --> 50:08.040
Not many people know it.

50:08.240 --> 50:11.800
It's an ITS machine,
kept online for historical sake.

50:12.000 --> 50:15.160
I hid my worm there,
where no one would ever look.

50:19.240 --> 50:20.440
Voila.

51:04.480 --> 51:07.560
Good man. Good man.

51:20.920 --> 51:23.960
Senator, we have a problem.

51:27.760 --> 51:31.000
- Senator.
- Seems you're in a predicament.

51:31.280 --> 51:32.280
Is that right?

51:32.480 --> 51:35.680
- I don't follow.
- Download your file.

51:46.240 --> 51:49.000
- Senator--
- You know where I got these?

51:49.160 --> 51:53.920
From the deputy director of the FBI.
He thought I might be interested.

51:54.120 --> 51:59.800
Sir, do you think there is any aspect
of this operation I am not aware of?

52:00.000 --> 52:03.320
We are aborting the operation.
Take a vacation.

52:03.520 --> 52:06.360
A vacation?
Have I ever failed you, sir?

52:06.520 --> 52:09.880
- That's not really the point, is it?
- It's my point.

52:10.080 --> 52:12.560
You're losing sight of our objective.

52:12.960 --> 52:15.000
The risks are too great.

52:15.200 --> 52:17.760
We'll seek alternative means
of finance.

52:18.200 --> 52:22.360
This operation is moving ahead.
Everything is under control.

52:37.560 --> 52:38.840
Son...

52:39.920 --> 52:43.280
...let's just say you've got
a 200-pound Rottweiler.

52:45.200 --> 52:47.320
Now, he loves you.

52:47.520 --> 52:50.160
It's his job to protect you.

52:51.160 --> 52:54.200
But if he bites you,
you got to put him down.

52:56.880 --> 53:00.840
Can never tell who he might bite next.
You understand?

53:01.040 --> 53:03.160
Yes, I do understand, senator.

53:03.360 --> 53:07.200
I think we got a team on the
West Coast. Fort Mac Arthur.

53:07.440 --> 53:10.280
Maybe they should
pay our friend a visit.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.720
Come on.

53:24.560 --> 53:27.120
Network IP range.
Confirmed.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.720
Please confirm. Confirm. Confirm.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.280
We are cruising!

53:37.760 --> 53:39.160
Oh, yeah.

53:45.360 --> 53:47.600
Next. And next.

53:48.120 --> 53:49.560
Too easy.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.400
No, don't. No, no, no. Yes!

53:52.600 --> 53:56.680
Three percent, please.
Oh, fuck. I'm fucked.

53:57.200 --> 53:59.000
No, no, no. Fuck you!

54:00.680 --> 54:02.640
Shit, there's no fucking way.

54:02.880 --> 54:04.520
I'm rusty. Rusty.

54:07.840 --> 54:09.320
Come on, come on.

54:18.800 --> 54:21.640
Okay. Time to disguise you...

54:23.160 --> 54:25.880
...as an internal destruction.

54:27.200 --> 54:30.600
Quick, quick. Thank you.
Return.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.440
Three, two, one, go. Come on.

54:34.680 --> 54:36.200
Come on. Yeah.

54:38.040 --> 54:39.160
Close.

54:40.760 --> 54:42.160
Yes.

54:47.040 --> 54:48.440
Oh, baby.

55:09.480 --> 55:12.120
Now I've just got to
modify the code.

55:16.480 --> 55:18.360
The bank's IDS logs every packer...

55:18.560 --> 55:21.920
...that go to any port other than
the 22 or 80 TCP.

55:22.720 --> 55:24.200
Holy shit.

55:24.800 --> 55:28.760
Okay, Chateau Attigue 1996.
White, white.

55:31.600 --> 55:32.960
Nope.

55:34.240 --> 55:36.320
Come on, come on.

55:42.200 --> 55:43.640
Here we go.

55:44.720 --> 55:48.280
Twenty-six. Ninety-six. Nine--

55:50.400 --> 55:51.680
Oh, shit!

56:00.960 --> 56:04.400
What's the matter?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.800
- We gotta talk.
- Let's take a drive.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.240
- Can't we talk here?
- We shouldn't.

56:11.400 --> 56:13.240
Ever heard of Harry Houdini?

56:13.440 --> 56:17.560
He wasn't like today's magicians,
only interested in television ratings.

56:17.720 --> 56:22.440
He was an artist. He could make an
elephant disappear in a full theater.

56:22.600 --> 56:24.560
You know how he did that?

56:24.800 --> 56:26.720
- Misdirection.
- What are you talking about?

56:26.960 --> 56:31.280
Misdirection. What the eyes see
and the ears hear, the mind believes.

56:34.200 --> 56:37.160
- What's going on?
- We've got a tail. Hold on.

56:44.000 --> 56:45.080
Shit.

56:48.000 --> 56:49.120
Jesus. Jesus!

56:58.040 --> 56:59.600
Take the wheel.

56:59.840 --> 57:01.800
- What?
- Take the wheel!

57:11.360 --> 57:12.320
Holy shit!

57:19.840 --> 57:21.400
Who are those guys?

57:22.200 --> 57:23.160
Jesus!

57:26.240 --> 57:28.360
What the fuck are you doing?

57:33.720 --> 57:34.680
Jesus!

57:52.680 --> 57:54.000
Drive, Stan.

57:55.480 --> 57:56.600
Move!

57:57.400 --> 57:59.800
- I can't drive this thing.
- Learn!

58:03.600 --> 58:05.640
- Move it.
- Come on!

58:35.480 --> 58:37.440
Hard left! Hard left!

58:50.920 --> 58:52.000
Keep going!

58:53.840 --> 58:54.800
Go!

59:44.880 --> 59:46.200
Get in the car.

59:48.320 --> 59:51.440
Not until you tell me
what I'm involved in.

59:53.600 --> 59:56.000
Look, Stanley, I like you.

59:56.240 --> 01:00:00.920
You're on my good side. But don't
confuse kindness with weakness.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.960
You have 12 hours to get the hydra.
So get in the car.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.000
Stanley, are you okay?

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.560
I just saw that maniac murder people
in the street. I'm fucking great.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.280
You can't leave. It'll all work out.
You gotta trust me.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.600
Trust you? Yeah.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.720
You're DEA, I got the feds up my ass and
I don't know what's going on here.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:30.360
If we don't find out who he works for,
we'll have to start over.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:34.280
That's not my problem.
I don't care who he works for.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:37.760
What about Holly?
Do you give a shit about her?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:41.040
Finish the job.
We'll get your daughter back.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.840
I promise.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.080
Ah, the great American outdoors.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:39.800
Yet I never understood
the appeal of fly-fishing.

01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.960
A bit too much like masturbation for me
without the payoff.

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:47.440
This is a catch-and-release stream,
isn't it?

01:01:47.640 --> 01:01:49.520
Yeah, I believe it is.

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:52.880
You must see the irony in that,
senator.

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:58.440
Chairman of the subcommittee on crime
fishing in a catch-and-release stream.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.120
How could you do it to me, Jim?
After all we suffered.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.920
I've changed my identity so often
I don't know who I am anymore.

01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:10.400
How could you do it?
We were so close to our goal!

01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:12.600
The FBI was watching you.

01:02:18.040 --> 01:02:19.920
You tried to kill me.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.760
You've misplaced your loyalty, senator.
You've sold out America.

01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:31.480
Patriotism does not have
a four-year shelf life.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.400
But politicians do.

01:02:41.480 --> 01:02:43.320
What are you doing with that?

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:49.800
Thomas Jefferson once shot a man
for treason.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.200
Hold the phone. Thomas Jeff--

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.760
- Stan. How are you?
- Fine.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.400
Finished?

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:42.760
Is this Stanley Jobson,
social security number 669547311?

01:03:43.480 --> 01:03:46.520
I'm calling from Credit Suisse
to notify you...

01:03:46.680 --> 01:03:50.320
... that $ 10 million was transferred
into your new account.

01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:53.080
- As promised.
- Thanks.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:58.480
So I'm done, then.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:00.760
Soon. Walk with me.

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:08.240
Against my better judgment,
I'm going to tell you who I am.

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:10.680
- I know who you are.
- Do you?

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.560
I think you think I'm a bank robber.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:16.520
But the truth is, I'm just like you.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:19.560
Like me?
No. Because you're a murderer.

01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.080
That I am, and worse. But I do
have ethics. Rules I adhere to.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:29.040
- Why are you telling me this?
- Well, if you listen, then you'll know.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:32.280
You asked who those men were.
I'll tell you.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:37.400
Hoover started a secret organization
in the '50s, called Black Cell.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.600
To protect our freedoms.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.800
I don't care.
All I care about is my daughter.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.520
I'm talking about your daughter.
You, your daughter...

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.400
...and 200 million Americans who take
their freedoms for granted.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.520
I see.

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.480
You don't know what it takes to
protect our freedoms. That's my job.

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.720
To protect your way of life.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:05.120
So you're really stealing all this
money just to protect little old me.

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:09.080
That's right, Stanley.
Because wars cost money.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.400
War?

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:17.600
Who are we at war with?

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.800
Anyone who impinges
on America's freedom.

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:29.120
Terrorist states, Stanley.

01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:32.400
Someone must bring their war to them.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:39.640
They bomb a church, we bomb 10.

01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:43.080
They hijack a plane,
we take out an airport.

01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.880
They execute American tourists,
we nuke an entire city.

01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:52.040
We make terrorism so horrific that
it's unthinkable to attack Americans.

01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:56.360
You're not using the phone lines.
You're going into the bank.

01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.080
And you're coming with us.
It'll all be over in 24 hours.

01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:02.360
You're a rich man, Stanley.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.480
Soon you'll be on a yacht with your
daughter, eating bonbons.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:09.360
The American dream. And just think:

01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:14.160
You'll have done your small part
in ensuring America's way of life.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.440
You're a hero, Stan.

01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.640
Stay there!

01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.440
Don't worry. Let him go.

01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:26.160
He'll be back.

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:30.240
Okay, load them up. Let's move out.
Let's go!

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.280
Back!

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.640
Move it, move it! Let's move!

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.720
Let's go. Hands behind your head.
Let's go!

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.880
Key, please.

01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:38.760
What key?
I don't know about any key.

01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.320
Key.

01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:03.600
Let's move!
Back of the bank. Now!

01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.080
Let's go, let's go!

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.120
Down. Everyone down!

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.479
Just wait here.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.840
Hello?

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.479
Melissa?

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:43.319
Holly!

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.920
Oh, God. Holly!

01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.319
Baby!

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.600
Baby. Baby. Shit!

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.040
No! Release the hostage!

01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.160
- Help me!
- Let her go!

01:09:19.319 --> 01:09:20.760
Let her go!

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.479
- Nick.
- Yeah.

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.760
- You all right?
- I'm good.

01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:14.800
- That was your decision!
- No, you did that!

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.960
How many people die is up to you!

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:20.640
I want that plane on the runway
in 25 minutes!

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.120
He wants a plane on the runway
in 25 minutes.

01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.120
My suggestion, sir?
You give it to him!

01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.280
He wants a plane?
I'll give him a goddamn plane.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:39.040
- Finish the job.
- Not until I see my daughter!

01:10:39.240 --> 01:10:41.880
You want to see her?
Get him his daughter!

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.040
- Dad!
- Oh, Jesus. Baby, are you okay?

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:51.000
It's okay, it's okay.

01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.960
You son of a bitch.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.920
You think I wanted it
to come to this?

01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.640
I'll sacrifice any lives I have to
to protect this country.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.640
Including my own.

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.680
Let her go.
And I'll get your money.

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:17.840
You finish the job, and you both go.
Come on, Stanley.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.960
- I need the disc.
- Disc.

01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.680
- How do you want it allocated?
- Spread evenly over the accounts.

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:55.240
Come on. Done. Give me my daughter.

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.680
- Verify this.
- Good.

01:11:57.960 --> 01:11:59.400
Get her.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:07.400
You okay?
Okay, come on.

01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:11.240
Stanley, hold up.

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:18.640
Good job.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.760
- See you around.
- I doubt it.

01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:30.080
What's happening? What's happening?

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.960
- The money's gone.
- Stop her!

01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:35.880
Go! Run!

01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:37.520
Go!

01:12:41.600 --> 01:12:43.000
She's coming out.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.840
Come here, come here!

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.560
What happened, Stan?

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.640
The explosion scrambled
the internal clock.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:01.440
No, it didn't. You fucked me.

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:08.600
You kill me, you'll never get a dollar.

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.080
The money jumps every 60 seconds
from one account to another.

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.760
It'll do so for the next 10 years.

01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:19.040
It wasn't supposed to happen
for another six hours, but hey.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.840
- Fix it.
- Unfortunately, I can't.

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.800
The accounts are encrypted
with a 1024-bit cipher.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.760
Even I can't get through the firewall.
So here's the deal:

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.320
Let the hostages go and I'll
tell you how to get the money.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.760
We all walk away. Nobody gets hurt.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.200
Deal?

01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.200
I'm thinking.

01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:43.000
No deal. Get Ginger.

01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:47.240
Move out.

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.680
- What are you doing?
- String her up.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.520
- No. Don't do this.
- No! Wait, Wait!

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.040
Hey, stay still!
It'll feel real good.

01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:01.240
No, don't do this!

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.520
- How long will she live? 60 seconds?
- You're insane!

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:17.000
- Fifty-five.
- Okay, okay.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:21.360
- Hope you built in a back door.
- Come on, come on.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:33.480
Come on, come on.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.840
Thirty.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:44.280
Plane's on the runway
in a half-hour.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:45.720
Good.

01:14:49.040 --> 01:14:50.280
Twenty.

01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:56.080
- She's dying.
- Shut the fuck up!

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:01.200
Ten. Nine. Eight.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.960
Accounts, accounts.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.280
That's it.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.160
Three. Two.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:17.280
There it is. Get her down!

01:15:17.480 --> 01:15:18.920
- Check.
- Verified.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.360
Bring her down.

01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:35.960
Jesus.

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:40.120
She was DEA, Stan. Move them out!

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.280
Let's move. Quickly and quietly.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.360
- Go, go!
- Move it. Come on, people.

01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:55.880
Move. Move.

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:05.320
No one wants a repeat of this morning.

01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.560
Keep your distance.
Clear the air space for five miles.

01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:12.360
They're on the move.

01:16:13.720 --> 01:16:15.200
Move, move.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:27.600
What?

01:16:32.440 --> 01:16:34.200
I know what you're thinking.

01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.960
You're thinking:

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:39.080
If that launcher was a suppository...

01:16:39.320 --> 01:16:42.720
...would that bad man stick it
up my ass?

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:47.480
Well, you eyeball me once more, boy...

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:50.040
...I'll stick it so far up your ass...

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.760
...you'll be begging me
for this bullet.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.480
This bus is your new holding area.

01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:01.080
If you don't test your collars,
this will all be over soon.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:20.640
Let's get this son of a bitch.

01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:41.480
- How can you justify all this?
- You're not looking at the big picture.

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.200
Here's a scenario:

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:46.200
You can cure all diseases,
but the price...

01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:50.600
...is that you must kill one
innocent child. Could you do it?

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.760
No.

01:17:52.400 --> 01:17:55.200
You disappoint me.
It's the greatest good.

01:17:55.720 --> 01:18:00.120
- How about 10 innocents?
- Now you get it. How about 100? 1000?

01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.640
To preserve our way of life.

01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:06.120
No man has the right to make that
decision. You're just a terrorist.

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.960
You're wrong, Stanley.

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:12.080
Thousands die every day for no reason.
Where's your bleeding heart for them?

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:15.840
You give $20 to Greenpeace
thinking you change the world.

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:20.480
What country will harbor terrorists
when they see the consequences?

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.800
Did you know I can buy nuclear
warheads in Minsk for 40 million?

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.360
Hell, I buy half a dozen,
I even get a discount.

01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:35.400
Advise Joy 20 minutes ETA
at the airport.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:40.280
Control, please let A.D. Joy know
we're 20 minutes from the airport.

01:18:47.240 --> 01:18:49.560
- Ready?
- Bird's fueled, ready to go.

01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:52.920
- What about your pilot?
- He's in the works now.

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.160
All right. Let's do it.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:00.600
Okay, I need a team over here.
The rest of you, let's go outside.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.720
Fuck!

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.800
Jesus. What the fuck is he thinking?

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.040
- Aren't we going to the airport?
- Misdirection, Stan.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:46.920
What are you doing?
Where are you taking the thing?

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:51.760
You see Sugarland Express?
Didn't like the way it ended.

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.680
Pull over before you get--

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:15.320
They can't be serious.

01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:16.680
Hold on!

01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:33.160
Attention control, this has
now become an aerial pursuit.

01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:37.440
I've also got people
across the tarmac.

01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:42.680
Sir, I've just been informed that
the bus is no longer en route to LAX.

01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.560
- What happened?
- It broke through the vehicles...

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:50.160
- ...and turned onto First Street.
- All right. Let's go.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:54.000
Sir, the bus is no longer
on First Street.

01:20:56.440 --> 01:20:57.880
Then where is it?

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:00.720
Airborne.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:29.680
- What's he doing?
- We have a strong wind condition.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:33.840
Tell him to climb!
Climb, goddamn it! Climb!

01:21:35.280 --> 01:21:36.760
Down! Everybody down!

01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.000
Add action or excitement, or change
the direction of the entire campaign.

01:21:50.200 --> 01:21:53.040
Maybe we ought to rethink the visuals.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:56.400
Holy shit.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:43.320
Secure a perimeter
around the building.

01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:46.520
I want everybody out of
this lobby right now.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.840
Secure the elevators and stairs!
Anybody coming out, detain them!

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:55.920
- What's going on?
- The elevators to the roof?

01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.360
- Up there.
- And the freight elevator?

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.840
- Rear of the building.
- That way.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:18.240
Stan-man.

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:22.880
Take care of your girl.
Maybe I'll see you around.

01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:25.720
No! It's not going to end like this.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.440
Come on, Stan.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:30.680
Not everything ends
as you think it should.

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:31.920
Besides...

01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:34.240
...audiences love happy endings.

01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.440
Stay here!

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:51.200
Shit! Come on.

01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.880
Move, move!

01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:04.120
- No, Stanley!
- Come on.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.960
Get him out of here.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.920
Secure that weapon.

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:20.120
Let's go.

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:27.160
Gentlemen.

01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:32.960
You here to identify the body?

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:50.920
The dentals match those
the Israeli government sent us...

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:55.000
...for an ex-Mossad agent
named Gabriel Shear.

01:25:55.320 --> 01:25:56.680
Excuse me, sir.

01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:03.000
The DEA has no record of any
Ginger Knowles working for them.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:07.920
I checked all the hospitals and
morgues, and I can't find her body.

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.120
Look again.
Bodies just don't disappear.

01:26:12.120 --> 01:26:13.520
Right.

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:16.040
He could make
an elephant disappear...

01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:19.400
...in a full theater.
You know how he did that?

01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.560
Misdirection.

01:26:20.760 --> 01:26:22.200
I'm DEA, Stanley.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:25.560
Give him the worm,
take the money and get out of here.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:28.960
What the eyes see and the ears hear,
the mind believes.

01:26:35.320 --> 01:26:37.240
Misdirection, Stan.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:48.760
This is a bad guy.
Nobody's going to miss him.

01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:53.240
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm good.

01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.920
Why don't you get out of here?
Go see your daughter.

01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:01.880
Yeah, thanks.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.160
We'll be in touch.

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:11.560
You son of a bitch.

01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:22.000
- Thank you. You're done?
- Yes, I'm full.

01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.280
Good. Let's go.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.520
So, navigator,
where's our next stop?

01:27:30.760 --> 01:27:32.600
- Holbrook.
- Holbrook.

01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:38.040
- So what's in Holbrook?
- The Petrified Forest, Dad.

01:27:39.520 --> 01:27:43.320
- I think you take the I-40 to the 180.
- Cool.

01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:45.840
Alrighty.

01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:49.880
- Are you okay, Dad?
- Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:52.720
Okay.

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:02.360
Don't worry, Dad.
It's going to be okay.

01:28:02.520 --> 01:28:06.120
- We're going to be fine.
- I know, honey.

01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.040
I'd like to transfer money
from my employer's account.

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:34.760
May I have your account number
and password, please?

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:39.920
356126G. Password: Swordfish.

01:28:42.080 --> 01:28:44.440
How much would you like to transfer?

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:48.240
All of it. Evenly over these accounts.

01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:07.200
It's done.

01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.920
In international news,
terrorist Allal bin-Hazzad...

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.320
... was killed today
in an unexplained explosion...

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:26.760
...on a yacht
in the Mediterranean.

01:29:26.960 --> 01:29:30.280
The elusive bin-Hazzad
was thought responsible for...

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:34.160
... the U. S. embassy bombing
in Istanbul earlier this month.

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:38.680
This is the third killing of a
terrorist leader in as many weeks.
