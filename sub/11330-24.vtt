GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...

00:03.433 --> 00:04.634
Are people looking at me?

00:04.701 --> 00:06.035
Don't people have something better to do

00:06.102 --> 00:07.670
than talk about who's gay and who's not?

00:07.737 --> 00:09.906
You'd be going to a new
school your senior year.

00:09.973 --> 00:11.174
I can get you an
application for the school.

00:11.241 --> 00:13.276
I've thought about kissing a woman.

00:13.343 --> 00:14.110
I've thought about kissing you!

00:15.511 --> 00:17.146
Please. Just let me transfer.

00:17.213 --> 00:18.915
Look, I know it's a lot of money...

00:18.982 --> 00:22.085
You're going to finish at
the school where you started.

00:22.151 --> 00:23.653
I can't believe people think I'm gay.

00:23.720 --> 00:24.153
Maybe we should move the wedding up.

00:24.220 --> 00:26.656
You're curious. I'm curious.

00:26.723 --> 00:27.724
Kiss me.

00:31.160 --> 00:32.161
(GASPS)

00:32.228 --> 00:33.099
It's $1,200 to apply.

00:33.099 --> 00:34.864
You have a credit card?

00:34.931 --> 00:36.666
Just tell me what's going on...

00:36.733 --> 00:37.386
I need you to be my boyfriend
and have sex with me.

00:37.386 --> 00:40.036
Hi, George. How was France?

00:40.103 --> 00:40.637
Do you want to go back to bed with me?

00:40.703 --> 00:43.339
We could just go back
to the way things were.

00:43.406 --> 00:46.209
If you hadn't told Kathleen that I'm
gay and she hadn't told the entire world!

00:46.276 --> 00:49.445
Don't you two have some sort of
agreement to be just with each other?

00:49.512 --> 00:51.481
She and Grace kissed
each other last night.

00:51.547 --> 00:53.750
Just because a girl kisses a
girl does not mean that she's gay!

00:53.816 --> 00:54.951
You're making way too much of this.

Hi. How's it going?

I thought you might like the
last piece of cake and some milk.

01:44.968 --> 01:47.036
Because I'm gay?

01:47.103 --> 01:49.272
Jacob's home from school,
isn't he? He told you.

01:49.339 --> 01:51.207
Well... I pressured him,
so it's not his fault.

01:51.274 --> 01:55.274
Just like if you're
gay, it's not your fault.

01:56.813 --> 02:00.984
Of course it's not my fault. It's
nobody's fault. There's no fault involved.

02:01.050 --> 02:03.653
And saying that just implies that
there's something wrong with my being gay.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.923
I... (SIGHS)

I'm just trying to find the right
words to say what I want to say to you.

02:10.660 --> 02:14.660
I mean, if you were blaming
someone, and you're not,

02:15.098 --> 02:17.728
I would hope that you wouldn't blame
me, but you'd blame your father.

02:17.728 --> 02:18.768
Why would I blame him?

02:18.835 --> 02:20.837
The man betrayed you.

02:20.904 --> 02:22.772
He betrayed all of us.

02:22.839 --> 02:25.308
Yeah. But I'm not gay. Obviously.

02:27.744 --> 02:30.146
Can I still live here? What?

02:30.213 --> 02:31.547
If you don't want me to, I understand.

02:31.614 --> 02:33.583
Grace, don't be ridiculous.

02:33.650 --> 02:34.317
I'm your mother, I love you.

02:34.384 --> 02:37.120
So you're okay with me being gay?

02:37.186 --> 02:41.157
I would be okay, yes, but...

02:41.224 --> 02:43.860
To be perfectly honest, I
hope that you're not gay.

02:43.927 --> 02:48.331
But that's only because being gay is
inherently more difficult than being straight,

02:48.398 --> 02:50.567
especially in high
school, I would think.

02:50.633 --> 02:54.633
No, it's not, it's, like, cool to be
gay. I didn't think I was this cool,

02:55.271 --> 02:57.674
I don't even know if I want to
be this cool, but I guess I am.

02:57.740 --> 03:00.677
Or maybe you're not.

03:00.743 --> 03:03.379
Did you kiss Adrian just to be cool?

03:03.446 --> 03:06.583
Well, it did start with a discussion

03:06.649 --> 03:08.751
about how we resent Amy for always
stealing the spotlight from everyone.

03:08.818 --> 03:10.420
By being gay. Yeah.

03:10.486 --> 03:14.624
Only she's not gay, she's
getting married to Ricky,

03:14.691 --> 03:16.826
so that's just a rumor.

03:16.893 --> 03:19.796
Is it? She chose a gay wedding day.

03:19.862 --> 03:22.198
I thought she was getting
married the fourth of July.

03:22.265 --> 03:24.467
Uh, hello! That's a gay holiday.

03:24.534 --> 03:25.363
Since when?

03:25.363 --> 03:27.704
I don't know. I just became gay.

03:27.770 --> 03:29.672
I don't know anything about it yet.

03:29.739 --> 03:32.041
All I know is I kissed
a girl and now I'm gay.

03:32.108 --> 03:36.346
Look. Don't you think you've joined enough
clubs at school without joining this one?

03:36.412 --> 03:40.149
I didn't know there was a
club. Although, I do like clubs,

03:40.216 --> 03:42.485
especially exclusive ones.

03:42.552 --> 03:44.254
So, if I belong, I belong.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.788
Do you belong?

03:45.855 --> 03:46.456
I don't know.

03:46.522 --> 03:50.460
Right, stay with that
thought, that you don't know.

03:50.526 --> 03:53.129
You kissed Adrian, but you
don't know if you're gay.

03:53.196 --> 03:55.698
I mean, maybe you are, maybe you're not.

03:55.765 --> 03:58.134
I think I know you pretty
well, and I don't think you are,

03:58.201 --> 03:59.435
but I could be wrong.

04:01.404 --> 04:04.040
But just live with that for
right now, that you don't know.

04:04.107 --> 04:06.476
I mean, I think that's
okay for you to not know.

04:06.542 --> 04:09.746
But I don't like your having
sex with a girl right now

04:09.812 --> 04:13.549
any more than I like your
having sex with a guy right now.

04:13.616 --> 04:15.418
A kiss is one thing, but
anything more than that, I...

04:15.485 --> 04:17.253
Well...

04:17.320 --> 04:20.555
I would say think about
it a little longer.

04:20.623 --> 04:22.692
Experiment in other ways.

04:24.661 --> 04:27.463
Like? I don't know.

04:27.530 --> 04:30.033
I was way past my comfort zone when
I came through the door with the cake.

04:33.836 --> 04:34.337
I heard you're gay.

04:34.404 --> 04:38.441
Yeah, yeah, whatever. Where are they?

04:38.508 --> 04:41.077
Your mom's asleep,
and uh... Ashley is...

04:41.144 --> 04:41.711
I don't know where Ashley is.

04:41.778 --> 04:44.447
Huh. Okay, I'll wait.

04:44.514 --> 04:46.816
You know what, Ames, I'm
going to ask you not to wait.

04:46.883 --> 04:49.319
I want to talk to your mom when she
gets up and I want to talk to her alone.

04:49.385 --> 04:51.187
Because? Because I do.

04:51.254 --> 04:52.655
I'll call you.

04:52.722 --> 04:53.756
Are you going to apologize
for what you told Kathleen?

04:53.823 --> 04:57.026
(SIGHS) Yeah. I am.

04:57.093 --> 04:59.195
Don't tell Mom you're in love with
Kathleen or anything stupid like that.

04:59.262 --> 05:02.465
Because? Because maybe you're not.

05:02.532 --> 05:05.134
Don't say anything that's gonna keep
Mom from ever coming back to you.

05:05.201 --> 05:06.936
I think it might go the other way.

05:07.003 --> 05:09.205
So that you have an excuse
to go back to your first wife?

05:09.272 --> 05:12.842
Dad, it's not true. Mom's
not any more gay than I am.

05:12.909 --> 05:16.679
Look, I know you want to see your mom,
but let me have some time with her, okay?

05:19.983 --> 05:21.618

better be something nice.

about it. It wasn't a big deal.

Are you sure you want to be the
center of attention for this?

I mean, Adrian, it doesn't really
seem like you're questioning anything

10:04.935 --> 10:07.571
and so it seems to me that...

10:07.638 --> 10:12.343
That people may take offense to you trying
to shock other people by kissing a girl.

10:12.409 --> 10:15.146
I didn't do it to shock people,

10:15.212 --> 10:18.616
I just... I don't mind
that it did shock people.

anything. They don't have a voice.

students not being heard.

10:39.870 --> 10:41.472
That may be too true to be funny.

10:41.539 --> 10:45.539
Oh, come on. Everyone at our
school gets treated the same,

10:45.843 --> 10:48.479
no one really cares who's gay or not gay

10:48.546 --> 10:50.748
unless of course, it's someone like me.

10:50.815 --> 10:53.717
Oh, really? Well, then maybe they should
just change the name of your school to

10:53.784 --> 10:55.386
"The Ideal High School."

10:56.921 --> 10:59.723
Adrian, are you really that naive?

10:59.790 --> 11:02.693
You may not care who's
gay or who's not gay,

11:02.760 --> 11:06.297
you may not care what anyone else's
sex life or sexual identity is,

11:06.363 --> 11:10.363
but believe me, other people do and other
people can be judgmental and hurtful.

11:11.669 --> 11:13.070
And again, I don't know why
someone hasn't said something

11:13.137 --> 11:15.606
about that little game you're playing.

11:15.673 --> 11:18.843
The only one who would say
anything is "that girl,"

11:18.909 --> 11:21.846
and I don't even think she's in summer
school. She's too smart to be in summer school.

11:21.912 --> 11:25.716
I'm sure "that girl," whoever
she is, she has a name.

11:25.783 --> 11:27.551
Yeah, it's, uh...

11:29.653 --> 11:31.489
Fern! Fern.

11:31.555 --> 11:33.524
What are you going to do when Fern

11:33.591 --> 11:34.725
or someone else comes up to you and
confronts you about the fact that you're

11:34.792 --> 11:38.028
using that kiss to get attention,

11:38.095 --> 11:40.131
while they're deeply
struggling with who they are?

11:42.600 --> 11:43.534
That is more likely scary
at your age than amusing.

11:47.671 --> 11:52.109
I totally understand. I hate
when I disappoint my parents, too.

11:52.176 --> 11:56.176
So... Why don't you tell your dad that
you want to tell me just what you told me,

11:57.081 --> 12:00.951
that you're not going to go to my
school, but you want to say it in person.

12:01.018 --> 12:04.989
Because it really would have been better
if you had told me this face to face.

12:05.055 --> 12:08.459
You're right, I'm sorry. That's okay.

12:08.526 --> 12:10.427
It's not too late. All you
have to do is ask your dad.

12:10.494 --> 12:13.497
Yeah. I guess I could do that.

12:13.564 --> 12:15.900
I'll see you at seven?
If my dad says it's okay.

12:15.966 --> 12:17.835
Of course. If your dad says it's okay.

12:22.206 --> 12:25.342
What now?

12:25.409 --> 12:28.746
Um... Here's the thing. I am definitely
not going to change schools just for Dylan.

12:28.813 --> 12:31.015
I am not going to change
schools for any reason.

12:31.081 --> 12:31.782
Get a look at your bank balances?

12:31.849 --> 12:35.786
No. It's just... I
hate disappointing you,

12:35.853 --> 12:39.853
mostly because I know you're not
disappointed unless I'm doing the wrong thing.

12:41.158 --> 12:43.928
I did the wrong thing. I'm not going
to do more wrong things on top of that.

12:43.994 --> 12:45.763
Oh, really? Really.

12:45.830 --> 12:48.632
But... I want to see Dylan tonight
and break it to her in person.

12:48.699 --> 12:49.733
I think I owe her that much.

12:49.800 --> 12:53.237
I don't think you owe
her anything at all,

12:53.304 --> 12:56.407
and like I told you before, what
you do with Dylan is your business.

12:56.474 --> 12:59.310
And I reiterate, if
you get into trouble,

12:59.376 --> 13:00.811
you're on your own.

13:00.878 --> 13:02.746
I'm just trying to do
the right thing here.

13:02.813 --> 13:05.082
I hope so. I really hope so, Ben.

13:10.020 --> 13:11.021
(SIGHS)

13:13.441 --> 13:13.441
+

13:16.046 --> 13:19.216
She's still not up?

13:19.282 --> 13:21.885
Excuse us for just barging in
when you told Amy you'd call her

13:21.952 --> 13:23.887
after you had a chance to talk to Anne.

13:23.954 --> 13:26.656
Your mother's not up, Amy.
She's on Paris time or something.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.693
Well, maybe I'll wake her up.
I want to see her. I missed her.

13:29.759 --> 13:32.362
Yeah, well, maybe we should think
about her. Your mother. She's exhausted.

13:32.429 --> 13:33.497
Why now?

13:33.563 --> 13:37.234
Why didn't "we" think about her when
"we" went over to Wife Number One's house?

13:37.300 --> 13:39.302
Ricky, why don't you and Amy go
out to dinner? I'll pay for it.

13:39.369 --> 13:43.240
We already ate. Amy, this obviously
isn't the right time to stop by.

13:44.007 --> 13:47.410
It's still my house, I can
drop by whenever I want.

13:47.477 --> 13:48.845
It isn't your house, it isn't even
my house, it's your mother's house,

13:48.912 --> 13:51.248
and your mother will
get up when she gets up.

13:51.314 --> 13:52.782
I'm up, I'm up.

13:52.849 --> 13:53.383
Mom! (LAUGHING)

13:55.051 --> 13:58.922
How are you? I'm good,
I'm good, I missed you.

13:58.989 --> 14:00.824
And you, Ricky, and John.

14:00.891 --> 14:02.592
All right, now that
you've seen your mother,

14:02.659 --> 14:04.494
you and your little family can
go do whatever you need to do.

14:04.561 --> 14:06.696
George, don't be rude, I want
to see Amy and her little family.

14:06.763 --> 14:09.566
I'm just going to go do
something not in here.

14:09.633 --> 14:11.968
We'll both go. Guys,
where are you going?

14:12.035 --> 14:15.705
Wherever we need to go so that Amy can say
whatever she wants to say to you and then go home

14:15.772 --> 14:16.907
so I can say what I want to say to you.

14:16.973 --> 14:18.275
Then go.

14:23.513 --> 14:26.983
I don't know what he wants to say
to you. But whatever it is can wait.

14:28.652 --> 14:30.253
Is everything okay?

14:30.320 --> 14:32.155
Oh, yeah, everything is fine.

14:32.222 --> 14:34.457
Did you get my text? We
set a date for the wedding,

14:34.524 --> 14:35.659
we're getting married
on the fourth of July.

14:35.725 --> 14:37.961
Yes. Interesting choice.

14:38.028 --> 14:39.996
Yeah, it's the first holiday
after I graduate from high school.

14:40.063 --> 14:42.132
Oh. Yeah.

14:42.199 --> 14:44.668
I guess it is. And
it's not a gay holiday.

14:44.734 --> 14:48.734
Oh. No. It's not a gay
holiday. Not that I know of.

14:50.273 --> 14:52.843
I wouldn't know... I...
Uh... I'm kind of new at...

14:52.909 --> 14:54.678
You're going to help me
plan the wedding, right?

14:54.744 --> 14:57.881
Of course I will.

14:57.948 --> 15:00.283
It's not going to be anything
big, maybe like 50 people?

15:00.350 --> 15:03.253
Whatever you want, Amy.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.921
I don't really know what I want.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.657
But I mean, a lot of people
don't know what they want.

15:09.926 --> 15:11.795
But you definitely want to get married
after you graduate from high school?

15:11.862 --> 15:13.597
Yeah.

15:14.931 --> 15:15.298
You don't sound that sure.

15:15.365 --> 15:19.365
Oh, no. I am that sure, I am.

15:20.237 --> 15:24.174
About getting married. I'm just not
so sure about who should be there.

15:24.241 --> 15:27.110
I only want family and
close friends there,

15:27.177 --> 15:30.647
and no ex-boyfriends, no
ex-girlfriends, no ex-anything.

15:32.949 --> 15:35.218
I take it if you want
me to plan the wedding,

15:35.285 --> 15:37.120
you'd want me to be at the wedding?

15:37.187 --> 15:39.589
Yeah, why wouldn't I want
you to be at the wedding?

15:39.656 --> 15:44.227
Well, because... It's
not easy to say, but...

15:44.294 --> 15:45.529
I'm gay. Dad's with Kathleen?

15:45.595 --> 15:46.963
You're what? Dad's with who?

15:47.030 --> 15:48.131
I'm gay. Kathleen.

15:48.198 --> 15:49.533
You didn't know? You didn't know?

15:49.599 --> 15:51.701
Okay, let's go back and try this again.

15:51.768 --> 15:53.637
You first. No, you go first.

15:53.703 --> 15:54.616
Mom, you're not gay.

15:54.616 --> 15:56.506
Yes, I am gay.

15:56.573 --> 15:58.575
No, you're not. You might
think you are, but you're not.

15:58.642 --> 16:00.744
You got married, you had children,

16:00.810 --> 16:02.946
you're in love with Dad, you
just don't want to admit it.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.616
Are you claiming to be gay because
Dad's going back to his first wife?

16:06.683 --> 16:09.519
Do you not want it to look like
you lost him to her or something?

16:09.586 --> 16:12.289
I didn't know that he was
going back to his first wife.

16:12.355 --> 16:16.355
I knew that he told her that I was gay,
but I didn't know he was back with Kathleen.

16:17.062 --> 16:18.328
I just thought he'd found someone.

16:18.395 --> 16:22.032
Yeah. He did. It's Kathleen.

16:22.098 --> 16:24.734
And he's just using your being gay
as an excuse to go back with her,

16:24.801 --> 16:26.503
so, Mom, don't buy into
it, you're not really gay.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.940
Look, I haven't really had a chance
to talk to your dad about this,

16:30.006 --> 16:31.474
and he hasn't had a chance to
tell me about Kathleen, I guess.

16:34.277 --> 16:36.213
That really sucks. Yeah.

16:37.914 --> 16:39.416
Are you sure? Am I sure?

16:39.483 --> 16:40.817
Yeah. I'm sure.

16:40.884 --> 16:43.753
He used my being gay as an
excuse to go back to her?

16:43.820 --> 16:46.356
Probably. And it's so unfair,
because you're not gay.

16:46.423 --> 16:47.324
I am gay.

16:47.390 --> 16:50.160
Mom, that's ridiculous.

16:50.227 --> 16:52.863
You were married forever and you've
had boyfriend after boyfriend.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.865
Uh-huh. None of which have worked out

16:54.931 --> 16:58.001
because I was never happy being
married to your dad or with boyfriends.

16:58.068 --> 17:00.203
I mean, I wasn't miserable
when I was married to your dad,

17:00.270 --> 17:03.573
just never felt complete.

17:03.640 --> 17:07.477
Well... That's not because you're
gay. That's because Dad's an idiot.

17:07.544 --> 17:09.646
Mom, I don't want you to be gay.

17:09.713 --> 17:14.317
I have nothing against people who are
gay but our family is different enough.

17:14.384 --> 17:14.951
Geez, do you really have to do this?

17:15.018 --> 17:17.487
RICKY: Amy!

17:17.554 --> 17:18.755
I'm talking to my mother. I heard.

17:18.821 --> 17:22.459
And excuse me for saying so, but that's not
really a nice way to talk to your mother.

17:22.526 --> 17:24.728
Stay out of it.

17:24.794 --> 17:28.865
No, I'm not going to stay out of it. My mom
is gay. And you're completely insensitive.

17:28.932 --> 17:29.399
If you didn't want to know
this, why'd you insist on

17:29.466 --> 17:32.669
coming over here to see your mom?

17:32.736 --> 17:35.705
I'm sorry this is Amy's response.
I support you all the way,

17:35.772 --> 17:37.741
you be whoever you are,
and we'll be happy about it.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.176
Won't we, Amy?

17:39.242 --> 17:41.244
Ricky, it's not about
whether or not we'll be happy,

17:41.311 --> 17:43.213
it's about whether or
not she'll be happy.

17:43.280 --> 17:44.848
And you're not going
to be happy being gay.

17:44.915 --> 17:46.216
Nora is.

17:46.283 --> 17:47.617
That's your role model? Careful.

17:47.684 --> 17:51.121
I don't know any other lesbians!
It... It doesn't matter.

17:51.188 --> 17:54.024
No, it doesn't matter at all.
You have a right to be happy.

17:54.090 --> 17:55.859
And no one can take that from you.

17:55.926 --> 18:00.197
Don't try and make me look like
I have a thing against lesbians.

18:00.263 --> 18:01.498
It's not like I don't
want her to be happy,

18:01.565 --> 18:03.834
that's just not the way to happiness.

18:03.900 --> 18:07.170
Mom, reclaiming what is
yours is the way to happiness.

18:07.237 --> 18:10.874
You have to try and stop Dad from going back
with Kathleen. That would make you happy.

18:10.941 --> 18:13.844
That would make me happy.
That'd even make Ashley happy.

18:13.910 --> 18:16.279
Wouldn't it be nice to
see Ashley happy for once?

18:16.346 --> 18:18.448
(SIGHS) You're grasping
at straws now, Amy.

18:18.515 --> 18:21.151
It's over, Amy. It's over.

18:21.218 --> 18:22.419
It's not going to be the
family you grew up with,

18:22.486 --> 18:24.754
but maybe things will be better.

18:24.821 --> 18:27.424
Maybe all of us actually have a
shot at being a happy family now,

18:27.491 --> 18:28.492
because everyone is free
to be whoever they are.

18:30.160 --> 18:31.428
Including you, Amy.

18:31.495 --> 18:35.465
Hi, Ashley. Hi, Ricky. How are you?

18:35.532 --> 18:36.666
He's fine. And I'm not gay.

18:36.733 --> 18:39.803
Who said you were? Everyone.

18:39.870 --> 18:43.406
Everyone has heard that you're gay and
now they think I'm gay because you're gay.

18:43.473 --> 18:46.176
And because the wedding is
set for the fourth of July.

18:46.243 --> 18:49.045
I don't get this. When did the
fourth of July become a gay holiday?

18:49.112 --> 18:50.881
It's kind of like you, Mom,

18:50.947 --> 18:54.017
it always was, it just became more
so the longer it's been around.

18:54.084 --> 18:54.718
You told her first? Yeah.

18:54.784 --> 18:56.853
Get John.

19:01.158 --> 19:03.026
I'll talk to her.

19:03.093 --> 19:05.762
No, I'll talk to her.
Just leave it be for now.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.132
Yeah, let it be.

19:09.199 --> 19:11.735
But if you need someone to talk
to, you still have my number, right?

19:12.769 --> 19:13.937
Goodnight.

19:17.407 --> 19:20.110
Your sister is not gay. Oh, I know that.

19:20.177 --> 19:21.444
And I also know she's
never going to marry Ricky.

19:21.511 --> 19:25.511
So don't count on being at
a wedding the fourth of July.

19:26.216 --> 19:28.652
Unless it's yours, Mom, then
that would make me very happy.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.533
I think we should get out of here.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.937
Why? I love sneaking into
buildings at night, it's fun.

19:47.003 --> 19:48.638
It makes me a little nervous.

19:48.705 --> 19:52.542
We're not doing anything illegal.
The security guard let us in.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.110
You lied to him.

19:54.177 --> 19:56.646
I could have left my
passport in my locker.

19:56.713 --> 19:57.914
Not likely.

19:57.981 --> 19:59.883
But possible.

19:59.950 --> 20:03.987
Just like it's possible that Amy is gay.

20:04.054 --> 20:07.123
Amy's not gay. Come on. I told
you I'd take you out for dessert.

20:07.190 --> 20:09.860
Yeah, you did. But we
don't have to go anywhere.

20:09.926 --> 20:12.562
This is why I wanted
to show you the lab.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.232
What's that?

20:15.298 --> 20:18.401
We do it in school. S'mores.

20:18.468 --> 20:21.571
I have marshmallows, and graham crackers

20:22.472 --> 20:25.876
and chocolate bars, and peanut butter.

20:25.942 --> 20:27.677
Peanut butter? That's a new twist.

20:27.744 --> 20:28.178
It's really good.

20:39.856 --> 20:41.158
Ah.

20:41.224 --> 20:42.125
Very clever. Thank you.

20:42.192 --> 20:43.293
You're welcome.

20:51.968 --> 20:54.004
Well, what was I supposed
to say, congratulations?

20:54.070 --> 20:57.908
That would have been better
than what you said, so yeah.

20:57.974 --> 21:00.844
Please. She can't be serious.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.979
This all started with my Dad teasing
her about looking at your mom.

21:03.046 --> 21:05.215
It's not real.

21:05.282 --> 21:08.251
Your being gay, that's not real.
This is real, Amy. Your mother is gay.

21:08.318 --> 21:10.453
I don't care how many times
you say it, it's not true.

21:10.520 --> 21:14.491
I don't get this, I really don't. We've
talked about this being a possibility.

21:14.558 --> 21:17.227
Well, talking about it
doesn't make it true.

21:17.294 --> 21:20.297
I talked about being a professional
French horn player and I'm not.

21:20.363 --> 21:22.833
I'm not even interested in
playing the French horn anymore.

21:22.899 --> 21:25.502
That is one strange analogy.

21:25.569 --> 21:29.039
Amy, your mother came out to
you, she told you that she's gay,

21:29.105 --> 21:33.410
I'm sure she was dreading telling you and
now all her greatest fears have come true.

21:33.476 --> 21:35.912
You can't hear her say it, you
can't accept what she's telling you.

21:35.979 --> 21:40.116
And that's really wrong, Amy.
It's not an easy thing to say.

21:40.183 --> 21:43.987
But she said she was gay, so she's gay.

21:44.054 --> 21:48.492
Ricky, you don't know my mom, I know
my mom, and she likes men. A lot.

21:48.558 --> 21:52.295
She's not saying she's
bisexual, she's saying she's gay.

21:52.362 --> 21:55.966
She doesn't know what she's saying, she
has jet lag. She's still on Paris time.

21:56.032 --> 21:58.468
Ugh, I hate Europe!

21:58.535 --> 22:00.937
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

22:01.004 --> 22:05.004
You know what? Just take some time with
this, take tonight to think about it

22:05.775 --> 22:09.112
and then get over there in the morning
and apologize and tell her you love her.

22:09.179 --> 22:11.181
Oh, she knows that I love her.
Just like she knows she's not gay.

22:18.722 --> 22:20.590
I'm back.

22:20.657 --> 22:23.727
Oh, yeah. I forgot I told
you you could come over.

22:23.793 --> 22:26.463
You didn't just tell me I could come
over, you told me I could sleep over

22:26.530 --> 22:27.230
and have sex with you. A lot of sex.

22:29.166 --> 22:31.168
Yeah... I don't know.

22:31.234 --> 22:33.670
What don't you know now?

22:33.737 --> 22:36.406
The same thing I didn't know
before, whether I'm gay or not.

22:36.473 --> 22:37.807
Well, I can help you with that.

22:37.874 --> 22:39.876
No, I need to figure it out on my own.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.111
How are you going to do
that, is that even possible?

22:41.178 --> 22:44.080
I'm not sure.

22:44.147 --> 22:47.117
But my mom said that I should try
experimenting in some non-sexual ways.

22:47.184 --> 22:48.718
And what would that be?

22:48.785 --> 22:49.820
I don't know. Hmm.

22:49.886 --> 22:53.990
Here's what I would suggest.
We just have sex right now

22:54.057 --> 22:56.426
and if you like it, we do it
one more time just to make sure,

22:56.493 --> 22:58.695
and, hey, if it takes,
it takes. I'll do my best.

22:58.762 --> 22:59.635
Nah.

23:01.765 --> 23:03.166
Come on, Grace. You
keep doing this to me.

23:03.233 --> 23:06.136
And I've been thinking about
you all day. You and Adrian.

23:07.237 --> 23:09.172
Wait. Did I just say Adrian?

23:09.239 --> 23:12.742
Yeah. You said me and Adrian.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.279
I suppose you get all turned on
thinking about me with another girl.

23:16.346 --> 23:17.581
What does that say about you?

23:17.647 --> 23:19.649
That I'm supportive, sensitive...

23:19.716 --> 23:22.085
Simple.

23:22.152 --> 23:24.754
I'm just a guy, all right?
A red-blooded American guy

23:24.821 --> 23:27.190
and you got me all hot
telling me about that kiss

23:27.257 --> 23:27.924
and that's all I can think about.

23:27.991 --> 23:30.594
That's all I thought about all day long,

23:30.660 --> 23:33.163
through one very intense
workout and a two hour scrimmage.

23:33.230 --> 23:34.397
Sorry.

23:34.464 --> 23:38.464
Actually, it seemed to kind of help.
I think I was overthinking my game.

23:39.369 --> 23:41.204
You know what, maybe
you're overthinking this.

23:41.271 --> 23:43.173
Maybe you just need to
kiss her again. What?

23:43.240 --> 23:45.442
Yeah. Kiss Adrian again
and see what happens.

23:45.509 --> 23:46.476
I'll drive you over there.

23:48.111 --> 23:49.112
I'll wait in the car. Well...

23:49.179 --> 23:53.179
My mom did say it was okay
just to, you know, kiss.

23:54.551 --> 23:58.551
Yes! I mean, I agree. Wholeheartedly.

23:58.855 --> 23:59.856
What do you mean you're
breaking up with me?

23:59.923 --> 24:03.627
You can't break up with me
just because I kissed Grace.

24:03.693 --> 24:06.229
You promised it would just be the two
of us and you didn't even last a week.

24:06.296 --> 24:09.799
Uh, no, I didn't. I
promised you no other guys.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.335
This wasn't a guy. This was Grace.

24:12.402 --> 24:15.438
She asked me to kiss her and so
I kissed her. What's the big deal?

24:15.505 --> 24:17.307
You kissed someone else,
that's the big deal,

24:17.374 --> 24:19.075
I don't care who it was,
man or woman. You cheated.

24:19.142 --> 24:20.243
You have to be kidding me.

24:20.310 --> 24:21.211
No. I'm not kidding you.

24:21.278 --> 24:25.278
It was Grace! I told you
she's attracted to me.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.984
And you even joked about asking her if
she wanted to come in to the bedroom.

24:28.051 --> 24:32.255
But that was a joke. And besides,
that would be us with Grace,

24:32.322 --> 24:34.991
not you sneaking around my back
with Grace, and it was a joke.

24:35.058 --> 24:37.594
Okay, so, that would be
okay? You, me and Grace?

24:37.661 --> 24:39.362
No. It wouldn't. Again. It was a joke.

24:39.429 --> 24:41.097
Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.

24:41.164 --> 24:43.133
It didn't mean anything and
neither did my kissing Grace.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.702
It meant nothing to me!

24:45.769 --> 24:48.338
I mean, it was like kissing a mirror.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.607
She's a girl. I'm a girl. I
didn't get anything out of it.

24:50.674 --> 24:52.042
Well, then you shouldn't have done it.

24:52.108 --> 24:52.876
(EXCLAIMING)

24:52.943 --> 24:56.079
That's not going to
get you anywhere either.

24:56.146 --> 24:58.882
Look, Adrian, I don't want to be in a
position to be telling you what's appropriate

24:58.949 --> 25:01.384
or inappropriate in a relationship.

25:01.451 --> 25:04.654
And if you're telling me that a kiss with
a girl doesn't count, I'd like to know why.

25:04.721 --> 25:06.490
Is a girl less than a guy?

25:06.556 --> 25:09.626
Is a kiss with the same sex less
than a kiss with the opposite sex?

25:09.693 --> 25:11.027
No. It's not.

25:13.029 --> 25:15.732
Could you kiss me again?

25:17.267 --> 25:21.238
Hmm.

25:21.304 --> 25:24.341
Wow.

25:24.407 --> 25:25.575
Goodbye, Omar.

25:26.109 --> 25:28.478
(DOOR CLOSES)

25:28.545 --> 25:31.348
Let's try that again. One more.

25:37.354 --> 25:38.989
Oh, look who's back from his walk.

25:39.055 --> 25:40.190
Yeah.

25:42.092 --> 25:43.927
I heard it didn't go well with Amy.

25:43.994 --> 25:45.729
What didn't go well?

25:45.795 --> 25:47.397
Uh... Whatever conversation you had.

25:53.503 --> 25:56.139
You know, I was just
joking about you and Nora.

25:57.307 --> 26:01.444
And then somehow, I just kind of...

26:01.511 --> 26:05.215
Hoped that you were gay so I'd feel like
I was justified in going back to Kathleen.

26:07.784 --> 26:10.287
Do you have to do that, George?

26:10.353 --> 26:12.789
Do you have to go back to Kathleen?

26:12.856 --> 26:15.926
Of all the women in the world,
does it have to be your first wife?

26:17.994 --> 26:20.263
I think maybe it always was her.

26:20.931 --> 26:22.399
No offense.

26:22.465 --> 26:23.633
Oh, no, of course not.

26:27.137 --> 26:31.174
If you ask me, she just
goes from man to man to man.

26:31.241 --> 26:32.475
As opposed to man to man to woman?

26:33.476 --> 26:35.445
Nice.

26:35.512 --> 26:39.516
So, did you meet someone or
are you just playing the field?

26:39.583 --> 26:41.351
No. I didn't meet anyone.

26:42.953 --> 26:45.322
Exactly. What does that mean?

26:45.388 --> 26:48.425
It means... Nothing. It means something.

26:51.561 --> 26:53.497
Just tell me, are you gay or not?

26:53.563 --> 26:55.131
Maybe you just hate men, maybe you
just hate me. And I don't blame you.

26:55.198 --> 26:58.134
I don't hate you, George.
I don't hate anyone.

26:59.135 --> 27:02.939
But yes, George, I'm gay.

27:04.140 --> 27:05.442
How do you know you're gay?

27:05.509 --> 27:07.377
Well, the thing is,

27:07.444 --> 27:09.412
I've been having dreams about being
with women for a long, long time,

27:09.479 --> 27:13.517
maybe even since I was a teenager,

27:13.583 --> 27:17.320
but I never considered that those
dreams were anything more than dreams.

27:17.387 --> 27:21.387
And I always figured I would grow
up and get married and have children.

27:22.325 --> 27:26.396
And that's what I was supposed to do. And
that's what I did. And I don't regret it.

27:26.463 --> 27:28.031
But the thing is...

27:30.100 --> 27:34.100
This is so difficult to say,
George, because I love you,

27:35.906 --> 27:39.906
I do, but you know how they say that
two people become one in a relationship?

27:44.648 --> 27:47.484
Well, we always felt like two.

27:47.551 --> 27:50.487
Like two people coming together as two.

27:53.657 --> 27:55.392
All right.

27:57.561 --> 28:00.230
Now that you've explained that,

28:00.297 --> 28:02.165
go back to you haven't
met anyone "exactly."

28:02.232 --> 28:04.668
Explain "exactly." (SIGHS)

28:04.734 --> 28:07.070
Well, one night when I was in Paris,

28:07.137 --> 28:10.373
I ran into a woman that
I had met in a shop,

28:10.440 --> 28:14.611
and she asked me out for
coffee, and I said, "Yes,"

28:16.346 --> 28:17.881
and we had coffee

28:17.948 --> 28:22.486
and she walked me back to
the hotel, and she kissed me.

28:24.888 --> 28:26.256
And I kissed her back.

28:29.693 --> 28:32.729
And I don't even have the words
to describe what that felt like,

28:34.531 --> 28:35.799
I mean...

28:35.866 --> 28:39.866
It was exciting and my
heart was racing, and...

28:41.304 --> 28:45.304
I felt like one. Free. Happy.
Excited. Like everything is brand new.

28:51.348 --> 28:53.783
And I want to be me, whoever I am,

28:56.319 --> 28:59.422
and I think that being
gay is part of who I am.

28:59.489 --> 29:00.824
And not gay is the other part?
I don't think I'm following you.

29:00.891 --> 29:03.727
George,

29:03.793 --> 29:06.663
I'm finding out a lot
of things about myself.

29:06.730 --> 29:08.532
I'm really good at running a business,

29:08.598 --> 29:11.801
I think I have some design talent,

29:11.868 --> 29:13.236
I may even want to go back to school
and get a degree in design, and...

29:17.440 --> 29:20.210
I'm gay.

29:20.277 --> 29:22.412
All right, well... Then you're gay.

29:24.481 --> 29:25.348
Yeah.

29:27.150 --> 29:30.020
I'm really kind of excited,

29:31.154 --> 29:33.657
but also kind of scared.

29:34.758 --> 29:36.359
Scared of what?

29:36.426 --> 29:40.426
Scared that my family
won't love me anymore.

29:41.298 --> 29:45.368
We're still going to love you, you're
still Amy and Ashley and Robie's mom,

29:45.435 --> 29:46.603
and you're still my Anne.

29:46.970 --> 29:48.839
(KISSES)

29:48.905 --> 29:50.640
(SNIFFLES)

29:53.243 --> 29:56.246
So it's Kathleen, huh?

29:56.313 --> 30:00.313
Hey, I want you to be happy, so
you should want me to be happy.

30:00.851 --> 30:03.286
Yeah. I do.

30:03.353 --> 30:04.187
Just not with Kathleen.

30:12.395 --> 30:15.966
So when you went out for
this coffee, who paid?

30:18.235 --> 30:19.269
She did.

30:21.471 --> 30:22.305
Huh.

30:23.845 --> 30:23.845
+

30:33.304 --> 30:35.206
Ashley! Oh. Hi, Toby.

30:40.979 --> 30:43.047
So how was it?

30:43.114 --> 30:45.617
How was what? Uh... Europe?

30:45.683 --> 30:46.818
Oh. It was pretty
much what you'd expect.

30:46.885 --> 30:49.020
That's it?

30:50.488 --> 30:51.890
Anything exciting happen? Like what?

30:51.956 --> 30:53.858
I don't know.

30:53.925 --> 30:56.527
I heard Amy's gay.

30:56.594 --> 30:58.396
Yeah, I heard that, but I
think we both know she's not.

31:00.398 --> 31:01.599
Do we? Yeah.

31:01.666 --> 31:03.001
She's getting married.

31:03.067 --> 31:05.703
Yeah, on the gayest day of the year.

31:05.770 --> 31:07.338
Yeah, you know, I didn't know about that.
It's Gay Liberation Day or something?

31:07.405 --> 31:09.040
Apparently.

31:09.107 --> 31:11.776
So... Anyone else gay?

31:13.912 --> 31:15.079
You mean me?

31:15.146 --> 31:17.015
Oh, no, no, not you.

31:17.815 --> 31:19.817
You know...

31:19.884 --> 31:22.253
Your mom? Oh. That.

31:22.320 --> 31:25.890
Yeah, she thinks she is, but at that
age what difference does it make?

31:25.957 --> 31:28.459
I mean, what kind of sex is she
having, she's in her forties.

31:28.526 --> 31:29.193
Yeah. Right.

31:31.896 --> 31:33.197
Still... Still? Who cares?

31:33.264 --> 31:34.866
Right. I don't care.

31:34.933 --> 31:37.268
No one in their right mind would.

31:37.335 --> 31:38.922
No.

31:43.575 --> 31:45.310
Thanks for calling me. I've missed you.

31:46.144 --> 31:48.313
Oh, yeah? Missed my smile?

31:50.081 --> 31:51.216
I've never seen you smile,

31:53.451 --> 31:55.587
but I'd love to. Someday.

31:57.188 --> 31:59.023
I doubt it.

31:59.090 --> 32:03.090
So, did you do anything
while you were gone?

32:04.028 --> 32:06.064
You mean did I have sex with anyone?

32:06.130 --> 32:07.321
Did you?

32:12.036 --> 32:13.471
What do you think?

32:13.538 --> 32:15.340
I think I love you.

32:15.406 --> 32:17.675
I love you, too.

32:17.742 --> 32:20.245
So if you see me flirting with
Ricky, that's just to annoy Amy.

32:20.311 --> 32:22.046
Why don't you give that up?

32:22.113 --> 32:23.748
Because then they'd notice us.

32:23.815 --> 32:25.817
I don't care. I don't either.

32:38.763 --> 32:41.666
Oh, hi! Oh, you're up.

32:41.733 --> 32:45.570
And out. I'll let you two talk,
I'm going to go check on Robie.

32:48.473 --> 32:50.041
So, um... How was it?

32:50.108 --> 32:52.577
Good. It was good.

32:53.912 --> 32:56.180
What are we talking about?

32:56.247 --> 32:58.516
The Eiffel Tower, or, um...

32:59.884 --> 33:00.852
Did George say you're out?

33:00.919 --> 33:03.054
Yeah. He said that.

33:03.121 --> 33:05.657
Out of jail or, like...

33:05.723 --> 33:08.526
Gay. Yes!

33:08.593 --> 33:11.896
Okay, tell me everything that
happened. Do not skip the details.

33:11.963 --> 33:12.997
I kissed a woman.

33:13.064 --> 33:14.399
Shut up. Yeah.

33:14.465 --> 33:18.465
Wow. Wow. Good for you.
A beautiful woman? Hot?

33:19.571 --> 33:21.806
No, she was one of the
trolls from under the bridges.

33:21.873 --> 33:23.808
She felt sorry for
me because I was lost.

33:23.875 --> 33:25.610
All right, I deserved that.

33:26.477 --> 33:29.013
So... Just a kiss?

33:29.080 --> 33:30.315
Yeah. But a nice kiss.

33:32.517 --> 33:34.419
It's really different kissing a woman.

33:34.485 --> 33:37.055
Yeah. (CHUCKLES)

33:37.121 --> 33:38.723
Hey, maybe you and I should...
Oh, no, we should not.

33:38.790 --> 33:42.727
Not you and me. We're
practically in-laws.

33:42.794 --> 33:46.331
We will be in-laws. It would
be entirely too incestuous.

33:46.397 --> 33:48.867
Besides, if you're still
in the experimental stages,

33:48.933 --> 33:51.870
I have already put in my
time with experimenters.

33:51.936 --> 33:54.339
I don't do that.

33:54.405 --> 33:56.908
Yeah, I was gonna say maybe you and I
should have a bowl of soup together and talk.

33:56.975 --> 33:58.309
I'm kind of hungry. Oh.

33:59.444 --> 34:00.912
Ha. (LAUGHS)

34:00.979 --> 34:02.714
But I am looking at you.

34:08.418 --> 34:09.621
Hey, I'm home. Just
want to say goodnight.

34:10.755 --> 34:12.623
Come on in.

34:12.690 --> 34:14.826
Is everything okay?

34:14.893 --> 34:19.063
Yeah, everything's fine. Except
that you wasted the $1,200.

34:19.130 --> 34:21.199
Well, I'm looking at it
as a $1,200 life lesson

34:21.266 --> 34:24.936
so it's not completely wasted.

34:25.003 --> 34:28.973
Well, uh, I guess no one's going to
be going to that school next year.

34:29.040 --> 34:31.876
What are you talking about? There
are 250 elite students at that school.

34:31.943 --> 34:33.043
Not anymore.

34:33.110 --> 34:36.581
What are you talking about?

34:36.648 --> 34:38.049
Apparently, it caught fire tonight,
looks like the whole place burned down.

34:38.116 --> 34:40.851
Dylan didn't know?

34:40.918 --> 34:45.123
No, she's been with me all night.
Did they say what caused the fire?

34:45.188 --> 34:49.226
Started in one of the science
labs, some sort of explosion.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.496
Did anybody get hurt?

34:51.563 --> 34:55.667
Apparently not. There was a security
guard but he was sleeping inside his car.

34:57.769 --> 35:00.038
You know the security guard over there?

35:00.104 --> 35:02.106
No. How would I know the security guard?

35:02.173 --> 35:06.173
I don't know, you just looked
a little overly relieved.

35:07.412 --> 35:09.647
No, I'm just happy no one got hurt.

35:11.015 --> 35:13.384
I have a lot of humanity.

35:13.451 --> 35:15.420
I better go call Dylan and tell her.

35:26.965 --> 35:30.068
Oh, my God. What did I do?

35:30.134 --> 35:33.137
Let's not freak out. We're best friends.

35:33.204 --> 35:36.507
Alice, best friends don't let best
friends have sex with each other, okay?

35:36.574 --> 35:39.711
This was wrong, this
was really, really wrong.

35:39.777 --> 35:40.378
It wasn't that wrong.

35:40.445 --> 35:43.181
No. It was. I just panicked.

35:43.248 --> 35:45.416
Okay? I never meant for us to...

35:45.483 --> 35:49.554
So, we'll just forget about it. The
way we forgot about Adrian and Henry.

35:49.621 --> 35:53.124
How are we going to tell Henry?
We're not going to tell Henry.

35:53.191 --> 35:55.827
It's none of Henry's business.
This is between you and me.

35:56.527 --> 35:59.097
Oh, God.

35:59.163 --> 36:03.163
Look, anyone who burned down a school would
panic and run to his best friend and have sex.

36:04.202 --> 36:07.939
It's a perfectly normal scenario at our
age. I can probably find stats on it.

36:08.006 --> 36:09.908
I doubt it.

36:09.974 --> 36:11.242
Ben, you don't know that
you burned down the school.

36:11.309 --> 36:14.512
Oh, no. We know we
burned down that school.

36:14.579 --> 36:15.947
How many other people were
in there making s'mores?

36:16.014 --> 36:18.950
And her dad works in
the security business,

36:19.017 --> 36:22.420
he set up the security system at that
school and he hired the security guard.

36:22.487 --> 36:24.923
Her dad knows the security guard.

36:24.989 --> 36:26.558
You told me all this last night, I'm not
going to sleep with you again this morning.

36:26.624 --> 36:29.027
Maybe I should just go in there and
confess. Tell my dad what happened.

36:29.093 --> 36:31.996
No. If Dylan's father knows anything, you
think he's going to rat out his own offspring?

36:32.063 --> 36:34.198
My dad would.

36:34.265 --> 36:35.133
Pudding Pop is not your dad.

36:35.200 --> 36:38.503
Just don't say anything. About anything.

36:38.570 --> 36:41.339
When you left, there was no fire. You don't
know that you and Dylan started the fire.

36:41.406 --> 36:43.608
But we might have, not
might have, we probably did.

36:43.675 --> 36:46.077
I'm sure we did. How
can I not say anything?

36:46.144 --> 36:47.912
Maybe I can get hysterical muteness.

36:47.979 --> 36:49.847
I'll check on that.

36:49.914 --> 36:51.249
I have to go. Wait. Alice...

36:52.183 --> 36:55.587
Thank you for coming over here,

36:55.653 --> 36:59.924
it may be the last chance I ever
have to have sex with a woman,

36:59.991 --> 37:03.628
because this time tomorrow morning,
I could be waking up in jail.

37:03.695 --> 37:07.298
One last time. Do not say
anything to anyone. About the fire.

37:07.365 --> 37:10.935
Or about you and me.
The fire never happened.

37:11.002 --> 37:14.038
And we never happened.

37:14.105 --> 37:15.740
I'll see you at school.

37:22.013 --> 37:24.015
Hey, Ricky!

37:24.082 --> 37:25.950
Yeah?

37:29.020 --> 37:30.388
I want to change my mind.

37:30.455 --> 37:32.557
No, you go apologize to your mother.

37:32.624 --> 37:34.359
Not about that. About the wedding.

37:34.425 --> 37:37.729
Oh, geez, Amy, you don't
want to get married? Amy...

37:37.795 --> 37:38.963
No, I want to get married right away.

37:39.030 --> 37:43.030
Forget the fourth of July. It took the gay
community so long to get their own holiday,

37:44.002 --> 37:46.137
let's just let them have it. They
shouldn't have to share it with us.

37:46.204 --> 37:49.140
And I don't want to steal
the spotlight from them, too.

37:49.207 --> 37:52.877
So, let's just do what you wanted to
do, and just run off and get married.

37:52.944 --> 37:54.579
Really? You want to do that?

37:54.646 --> 37:57.715
Yeah. I want to do that.
All this waiting is stupid.

37:57.782 --> 38:01.586
We already live together, we
have a son, we love each other...

38:01.653 --> 38:05.089
And you don't want your mother to bring a date
to the wedding or your dad to bring Kathleen.

38:05.156 --> 38:06.491
I'll take it.

38:09.460 --> 38:12.163
So... When? Whenever.

38:12.230 --> 38:15.266
That makes me really
happy. Okay, I have to run.

38:16.935 --> 38:17.702
Oh!

38:19.070 --> 38:20.872
I love you. I love you.

38:35.186 --> 38:35.587
Hello!

38:38.022 --> 38:40.091
It's me.

38:40.992 --> 38:43.661
I can't believe you
walked right past me.

38:43.728 --> 38:45.897
I mean, you should know who
I am, you kissed me twice.

38:45.964 --> 38:48.333
What are you doing?

38:48.399 --> 38:49.968
Why are you dressed like that?

38:50.034 --> 38:52.136
Because I felt like it. Just exploring.

38:52.203 --> 38:53.037
Exploring what?

38:53.104 --> 38:55.974
What I might look like if
I decide to be a lesbian.

38:56.040 --> 38:59.410
You don't just decide.
And there's no uniform.

38:59.477 --> 39:01.913
It's something you are or you're not.
And you already decided you're not.

39:01.980 --> 39:05.884
I know. Frankly, that last kiss stunk.

39:05.950 --> 39:07.452
The only one who got
anything out of it was Jack.

39:07.518 --> 39:09.888
So... The outfit? You're
just trying to get attention?

39:09.954 --> 39:12.090
Hey! You got all the
attention yesterday.

39:12.156 --> 39:15.093
People should be able to dress how
they want. I'm expressing myself.

39:15.159 --> 39:19.163
All right, well then, express yourself
by yourself. You're on your own today.

39:19.230 --> 39:21.099
Fine.

39:21.165 --> 39:23.368
Well, good luck.

39:27.772 --> 39:29.641
I'm Fern. Oh. Yeah. Hi.

39:29.707 --> 39:33.578
How are you? You know I'm gay, right?

39:33.645 --> 39:37.515
How would I know? I mean, I've
heard, but hey, what does that mean?

39:37.582 --> 39:39.817
It means that what you've heard is true.

39:39.884 --> 39:42.687
But how would I know
that and why would I care?

39:42.754 --> 39:45.890
I mean, you look like any other girl
at school, except for maybe Grace.

39:45.957 --> 39:49.627
Okay, well, I'm just saying, if you didn't
know I was gay, I'm telling you I'm gay.

39:49.694 --> 39:52.797
Oh. Well, good for you.

39:52.864 --> 39:54.866
I hear you and your friend have been
playing some little game around here,

39:54.933 --> 39:58.136
trying to get attention
by kissing each other?

39:58.203 --> 40:01.539
No, no, it wasn't really a game.
I was just helping a friend.

40:01.606 --> 40:04.375
And getting some attention for
yourself by trying to shock people?

40:04.442 --> 40:06.878
Well... I mean...

40:06.945 --> 40:08.580
It's not easy being gay in high school.

40:08.646 --> 40:13.251
Oh, sure, there's Griffin, whose
entire family seems to be gay so

40:13.318 --> 40:15.753
he's had things maybe a little
easier than the rest of us,

40:15.820 --> 40:18.256
especially since he grew
up with some self-esteem...

40:18.323 --> 40:21.226
But, Adrian, this whole
thing with you kissing a girl

40:21.292 --> 40:24.395
and everyone being so shocked by it,

40:24.462 --> 40:28.566
it's insulting. Do you
get that? It's insulting.

40:28.633 --> 40:32.337
Why should everyone be so much more
shocked by what I do than what you do?

40:32.403 --> 40:35.240
Why is a girl kissing a girl so much
more shocking than a girl kissing a guy?

40:35.306 --> 40:36.741
Uh...

40:36.808 --> 40:39.510
Well... It shouldn't be.

40:39.577 --> 40:42.547
I mean, is a kiss
between a girl and a girl

40:42.614 --> 40:44.415
any less than a kiss
between a guy and a girl?

40:44.482 --> 40:45.583
No! Of course not.

40:45.650 --> 40:48.353
I was just talking to my
boyfriend about that last night.

40:48.419 --> 40:50.455
In fact, we broke up over that.

40:50.521 --> 40:52.590
Here... Walk with me, I don't
want to be late for class.

40:52.657 --> 40:54.259
Yeah.

40:54.325 --> 40:56.527
Oh, yeah. So I was just
talking to my mother

40:56.594 --> 40:59.998
about gay students not having
a voice in high schools.

41:00.064 --> 41:03.568
I mean there's no voice for
the entire LMNOP community.

41:04.869 --> 41:07.672
It's LGBTQ community.

41:07.739 --> 41:09.674
Right. I keep getting that mixed up.

41:13.278 --> 41:14.612
Dude, really?

41:30.995 --> 41:32.664
Morning. Morning, Amy.

41:34.165 --> 41:35.833
I knew you'd come by.

41:35.900 --> 41:37.635
I'm sorry.

41:37.702 --> 41:40.538
I'm an idiot.

41:40.605 --> 41:43.308
I don't care if you're gay,
I just care that you're happy.

41:46.411 --> 41:49.013
Thank you.

41:49.080 --> 41:50.448
But you do care that I'm gay.

41:51.477 --> 41:55.477
I'll get used to it.
It's just new to me.

41:56.854 --> 41:59.958
Just like when I told you I was
pregnant and you flipped out.

42:00.024 --> 42:03.528
But then you got used
to it and you were fine.

42:03.595 --> 42:05.697
You've never been very good
with analogies, you know that?

42:05.763 --> 42:07.532
(LAUGHING) Yeah. I do
know that about myself.

42:09.434 --> 42:12.403
Just like you know you're gay.

42:14.105 --> 42:16.741
And we all know that love is love.
