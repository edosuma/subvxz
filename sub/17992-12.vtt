07:56.175 --> 07:58.744
Berg is sticking his neck out
for me, but I know I'm going to

07:58.811 --> 08:00.646
kill this showcase.

08:00.713 --> 08:05.685
I'm not going to let him down,
and more importantly, myself.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.153
So, I met with your
girlfriend yesterday.

08:07.220 --> 08:07.987
Who?

08:08.054 --> 08:08.988
Hazel.

08:09.055 --> 08:10.456
Right.

08:10.523 --> 08:13.125
First of all, she gives me this
fake ass apology and then she

08:13.192 --> 08:18.064
has the nerve to say "If
you want to move on with our

08:18.130 --> 08:21.200
friendship, you will
give the song back."

08:21.267 --> 08:23.035
Wait, the song me and you did?

08:23.102 --> 08:24.270
Why though?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.638
Because I want to
move on and have a

08:25.705 --> 08:27.406
jolly sisterhood with her.

08:27.473 --> 08:28.808
She fixing to give you
back all the rent money

08:28.875 --> 08:30.743
she moved out with?

08:30.810 --> 08:33.613
I said, "Listen, you didn't care
about my feelings when you

08:33.679 --> 08:36.115
were over there running
my news to Masika

08:36.182 --> 08:37.383
and doing all this
other [bleep]."

08:37.450 --> 08:38.517
Speaking of Masika.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.086
You guys in a relationship?

08:40.152 --> 08:41.854
It ain't really an
issues, it's a beautiful thing.

08:41.921 --> 08:42.855
We kicking it.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.690
That's my girl.

08:44.757 --> 08:47.827
Your girl-girl,
or your playgirl?

08:47.894 --> 08:50.496
Your Saturday or your, oh?

08:50.563 --> 08:52.999
Hazel and Masika were BFFs.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.166
They fell out over me.

08:54.233 --> 08:56.969
Over you, that's
my [bleep] point.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.539
Wasn't Berg just having
champagne and chocolate

09:00.606 --> 09:02.842
covered strawberries for TT?

09:02.909 --> 09:03.976
Now Masika?

09:04.043 --> 09:05.278
[laughs]

09:05.344 --> 09:07.847
Berg is crazy as hell and I
don't want to be anywhere

09:07.914 --> 09:09.882
near when Hazel finds
out they're serious.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.384
You know your girl
going to be tripping.

09:11.450 --> 09:13.586
How are you [bleep] Masika?

09:13.653 --> 09:15.388
How was you [bleep] Ray J?

09:15.454 --> 09:17.490
I talked to the [bleep]
the other day at your party.

09:17.556 --> 09:21.027
You're still feeling
that [bleep], huh?

09:21.093 --> 09:22.895
No.

09:22.962 --> 09:27.300
When he approached me at the
party I was just feeling like,

09:27.366 --> 09:29.602
damn, I missed him.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.504
Should I invite
Ray to the showcase?

09:31.570 --> 09:33.306
No, I don't want him there.

09:33.372 --> 09:34.473
Whoa, why not?

09:34.540 --> 09:36.809
It might make you pour
out your inner feelings.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.278
Everything that you have inside
of you, I want you to let

09:39.345 --> 09:40.780
all that [bleep] go.

09:40.846 --> 09:42.114
Can you do that?

09:42.181 --> 09:45.518
Absolutely.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.285
{\an8}I met this little chick.

09:46.352 --> 09:48.487
{\an8}Body is crazy.

09:48.554 --> 09:52.425
{\an8}Things just fall in your
lap, like a nice fat ass.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.026
{\an8}This is a little too romantic.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.695
{\an8}I don't want us to be
arguing all the time.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.230
{\an8}There was a point that
we did love each other.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.399
{\an8}[clapping]

10:00.466 --> 10:01.567
{\an8}You better believe that.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.536
{\an8}You know how big this
is for you right now?

10:03.602 --> 10:05.671
{\an8}This record is so
important to music.

10:05.738 --> 10:07.139
{\an8}Believe that to the game.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.208
{\an8}You're supposed to be my chick,
but word on the street around

10:09.275 --> 10:10.743
{\an8}town that is your man.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.844
{\an8}It's none of your [bleep]
business what the

10:11.911 --> 10:13.446
{\an8}[bleep] I'm doing.

10:13.512 --> 10:16.449
{\an8}I'm so inspired by this woman,
you know, Teairra Mari,

10:16.515 --> 10:18.084
{\an8}she's coming to the stage.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.155
Everything is settling down.

10:56.222 --> 11:00.659
So, now it's time for daddy
to get back on the grinine.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.862
Since I've been a part of May
Back Music, I've yet to present

11:02.928 --> 11:05.398
the world with an album.

11:05.464 --> 11:09.235
{\an5}I didn't want to be away and
baby have the baby

11:09.301 --> 11:10.703
and I wasn't there.

11:10.770 --> 11:14.507
But now since the baby's
here, oh yeah, we back at 100%.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.009
So, now I'm about to
catch this flight to Atlanta.

11:17.076 --> 11:19.311
But before I do that I
gotta check out Fizz.

11:19.378 --> 11:21.480
He's back in the booth, so I
want to have a listen to

11:21.547 --> 11:22.615
what he working on.

11:22.681 --> 11:24.216
About to have the club going up.

11:24.283 --> 11:25.651
Oh, man, you know.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.853
{\an5}It's about time I got
back in this booth.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.822
{\an5}I feel like after dealing
with everything with

11:29.889 --> 11:31.457
Amanda and Moniece.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.759
I kind of had my
priorities mixed up.

11:33.826 --> 11:36.662
So, this time I'm back on my
grizzy and I ain't let nothing

11:36.729 --> 11:38.564
take me off track.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.900
Not even pretty ass Nikki.

11:40.966 --> 11:44.270
Cam older now, so I'm just now
getting time to get back in here

11:44.336 --> 11:46.138
and try to find a
sound for myself.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.474
I understand, man, you know,
having a kid and having to be

11:48.541 --> 11:50.743
there for them.

11:50.810 --> 11:52.645
That balance is a [bleep], man.

11:52.711 --> 11:54.046
What?

11:54.113 --> 11:55.681
I'm like, you know, finally
being able to have a little time

11:55.748 --> 11:58.551
to breathe, focus on my music.

11:58.617 --> 12:01.720
I gotta go see Rosay in Atlanta,
you know,

12:01.787 --> 12:03.155
play him this new single.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.857
I'm like dumb excited.

12:04.924 --> 12:07.493
It's all in perfect timing, bro.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.029
I can't wait to get back on
the scene, drop this new album.

12:10.096 --> 12:11.931
This time it's a
little different.

12:11.997 --> 12:14.100
You know, I'm going to have to
find a balance in between

12:14.166 --> 12:19.538
my entertainment, my first
love, and parenthood.

12:19.605 --> 12:23.576
So, if Fizz can take himself
away from all the drama from the

12:23.642 --> 12:27.379
women in his life we, ladies and
gentlemen, and I just did say

12:27.446 --> 12:31.817
we, can take this to a
whole 'nother level.

12:31.884 --> 12:33.052
'Cause we've seen the top.

12:33.119 --> 12:34.787
Going up.

12:34.854 --> 12:36.989
I know [bleep]
been crazy with you.

12:37.056 --> 12:38.390
So, with you and Amanda, bro?

12:38.457 --> 12:39.492
I'm all the way done with her.

12:39.558 --> 12:40.426
All the way done?

12:40.493 --> 12:41.060
All the way done.

12:41.127 --> 12:41.827
100%?

12:41.894 --> 12:42.728
100%.

12:42.795 --> 12:43.696
I'm not talking about 99.9.

12:43.762 --> 12:45.831
I gave her too
many chances, man.

12:45.898 --> 12:46.866
You can't go back, bro.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.867
I got appreciated more.

12:47.933 --> 12:48.868
Right.

12:48.934 --> 12:49.969
But I met somebody else too.

12:50.035 --> 12:51.036
Oh, you did?

12:51.103 --> 12:53.139
Yeah, I met this
little chick named Nikki.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.974
You giving that look.

12:55.040 --> 12:56.675
Shut up!

12:56.742 --> 12:58.277
Man, it was like
your voice changed.

12:58.344 --> 13:01.914
I mean, you just got into a
whole other vibe right now.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.517
So, tell me about the new one.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.484
Body's crazy.

13:05.551 --> 13:06.485
How is her head?

13:06.552 --> 13:07.620
Is she smart?

13:07.686 --> 13:08.921
I like her a lot,
she's a real sweet person.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.990
We'll see.

13:11.056 --> 13:13.993
Fizz has had some
interesting ladies.

13:14.059 --> 13:16.295
Attractive, but
more of a distraction.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.498
But I hope this new chick, you
know, is more about contributing

13:19.565 --> 13:21.734
and keeping him focused.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.235
See how things work out,
you're making the

13:23.302 --> 13:24.870
right decisions in your life.

13:24.937 --> 13:28.340
Things just falling in your
lap, like a nice fat ass.

13:28.407 --> 13:31.443
[laughs]

13:31.510 --> 13:32.745
You feel me?

13:32.811 --> 13:34.547
I wish some sense could fall
in my lap with Moniece,

13:34.613 --> 13:35.614
that's what I wish.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.283
What's going on with that, bro?

13:37.349 --> 13:38.851
It's [bleep] terrible.

13:38.918 --> 13:41.287
I need to get to the bottom of
this whole doing interviews and

13:41.353 --> 13:43.856
trying to portray me
as something I'm not.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.792
She made accusations as
if I'm putting hands on her

13:46.859 --> 13:48.661
and trying to keep Cameron
away from her.

13:48.727 --> 13:49.728
No.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.963
I don't want to
[bleep] deal with her.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.298
It's all about Cam, bro.

13:52.364 --> 13:55.401
This is the only thing that
will get in the way of

13:55.467 --> 13:56.502
his true growth.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.872
This is your one
real life project.

13:59.939 --> 14:03.576
Not the music, not
nothing else, bro.

14:03.642 --> 14:06.178
This is your one project
that you gotta ace on.

14:06.245 --> 14:09.915
Try your best to come
to where she's at, bro.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.283
Talk to her, man.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.720
Just let your guard down too.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.822
I never really wanted to fight
with Moniece the way we did

14:16.889 --> 14:20.159
the other day, but she sure
knows how to push my buttons.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.762
O is right, we may not ever
really like each other, but at

14:23.829 --> 14:26.065
the end of the day, we're always
going to be Cam's parents.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.299
Just come to her, bro.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.401
Make things easier for yourself.

14:29.468 --> 14:30.169
You're right.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.204
I know what I need to do.

14:32.271 --> 14:39.845
♪♪

14:39.912 --> 14:42.181
{\an5}I really wish things worked
out different between me and TT.

14:42.248 --> 14:46.252
{\an5}You know, but she chose a song
with Berg over our friendship.

14:46.318 --> 14:50.189
But guess what, good riddance
to her ass, Berg and that

14:50.256 --> 14:51.890
treacherous ass ho, Masika.

14:51.957 --> 14:55.094
Obviously I put my trust
in all the wrong people.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.096
I need to surround myself
with people who got the

14:57.162 --> 14:59.098
same interest that I do.

14:59.164 --> 15:01.600
And there's one person who I
always wanted to link up with.

15:01.667 --> 15:02.735
Hi, Hazel.

15:02.801 --> 15:04.136
Miss Nikki baby.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.604
How are you?

15:05.671 --> 15:07.806
Ever since Nikki and Masika got
into it at Masika's whack ass

15:07.873 --> 15:12.011
billboard party, it got me
thinking, maybe me and this girl

15:12.077 --> 15:14.046
got something more in
common than our hatred for

15:14.113 --> 15:15.481
that bitch Masika.

15:15.547 --> 15:17.650
I'm glad you could
come and meet me today.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.119
And since I might be in the
market for some new friends,

15:20.185 --> 15:21.587
I thought I'd reach out.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.656
You know, we ran into each
other at the billboard party

15:23.722 --> 15:25.724
that old girl Masika.

15:25.791 --> 15:26.959
Mosquito.

15:27.026 --> 15:28.093
Yeah.

15:28.160 --> 15:30.796
I wanted to kind of
just reach out to you.

15:30.863 --> 15:32.731
I know as far as Teairra goes,
you guys have kind of

15:32.798 --> 15:33.999
developed a friendship.

15:34.066 --> 15:35.234
Right.

15:35.301 --> 15:36.502
I'm not going to
lie, I miss my friend.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.305
And a lot of petty, dumb
[bleep] came in between us.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.540
{\an5}I almost didn't come here today
since Hazel and Teairra

15:41.607 --> 15:42.875
{\an5}had a fall out.

15:42.941 --> 15:45.244
{\an5}I figure my loyalty is to
Teairra at the end of the day.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.946
But Hazel and I never had a
chance to talk one-on-one.

15:48.013 --> 15:49.782
I do know we have one thing
in common and that's

15:49.848 --> 15:51.183
our enemy Masika.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.985
So, I figured why not just come
here and see what she

15:53.052 --> 15:54.186
had to say.

15:54.253 --> 15:55.621
You know, Teairra never
messed around with Berg.

15:55.688 --> 15:56.789
I mean, I know.

15:56.855 --> 15:58.524
I was just upset they
were working together.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.393
Who I was really
furious with was Masika.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.896
Before I went to the party I
went and hollered at Masika

16:03.962 --> 16:06.065
because i guess she was
getting ready for the party.

16:06.131 --> 16:11.804
Because on Instagram I had seen
the bitch over here kissy faced

16:11.870 --> 16:13.172
and all this and that.

16:13.238 --> 16:16.342
And I'm like, "Yo, you a
fraud ass, fake ass bitch."

16:16.408 --> 16:20.012
Wasn't I just sitting here
crying on your shoulder

16:20.079 --> 16:21.246
about this [bleep]?

16:21.313 --> 16:22.781
She denied it, or
what did she say?

16:22.848 --> 16:24.983
She said, "You're
crazy, you're delusional.

16:25.050 --> 16:27.219
Are you more mad at the
pictures, or are you more

16:27.286 --> 16:28.721
mad he doesn't want you?"

16:28.787 --> 16:30.789
And then she say,
"I'm not [bleep] with him.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.024
We're best friends."

16:32.091 --> 16:34.593
Well, I'm here to tell
you that you're not crazy.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.829
I know people who are very
close to the two of them.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.132
Masika and Berg,
and they are dating.

16:40.199 --> 16:41.967
He is [bleep] with her
and so you're not crazy.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.302
I knew they were [bleep] around.

16:43.369 --> 16:45.270
I just didn't
want to believe it.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.638
That bitch ain't my friend.

16:46.705 --> 16:49.174
She's really just a backstabbing
bitch who just uses people

16:49.241 --> 16:51.977
for fame, popularity and
to get ahead in life.

16:52.044 --> 16:54.813
She's what you call a
by-any-means-necessary bitch.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.416
The true definition
of an opportunist.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.418
I can't [bleep] with
no bitch like that.

16:59.485 --> 17:00.652
She has to go away.

17:00.719 --> 17:03.021
She'll do anything to get
ahead, it's disgusting.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.357
I recently had just seem
something on the internet

17:05.424 --> 17:08.127
that I think the bitch is
a porno star too.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.428
Oh, you know, I
heard about that too.

17:09.494 --> 17:11.063
You [bleep] on
camera for money too?

17:11.130 --> 17:13.732
The only thing I'm thankful for
is that [bleep] kissed me

17:13.799 --> 17:15.401
before he kissed her.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.769
Well, I've had my little run
down with Masika too,

17:16.835 --> 17:18.270
which I'm sure you know.

17:18.337 --> 17:20.506
I feel like you need to let her
know, "Bitch, you didn't fool me

17:20.571 --> 17:21.973
back then, and you
aren't fooling me now.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.108
I knew what kind of bitch
you were from day one."

17:24.175 --> 17:25.978
Day one, straight up.

17:26.044 --> 17:29.081
I might go ahead and bless
Masika with my presence.

17:29.148 --> 17:32.117
For one last time.

17:32.184 --> 17:34.386
She might get a little taste of
the Hazel-E, baby,

17:34.453 --> 17:35.554
and it'll be her last.

17:35.621 --> 17:36.922

heard Princess fell in the pool.

And I always keep it 100
with him, so right now

18:27.806 --> 18:29.274
I got to explain myself.

18:29.341 --> 18:30.742
This is the thing, Dogg.

18:30.809 --> 18:33.812
My girl was talking to Morgan
and I don't appreciate that.

18:33.879 --> 18:34.847
Uh huh.

18:34.913 --> 18:36.415
My girl's supposed
to be ride or die.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.116
We in the bed talking, you ain't
supposed to tell anybody

18:38.183 --> 18:40.385
[bleep] about nothing.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.223
She went back and told [bleep]
Morgan about everything we was

18:44.289 --> 18:46.625
talking about, trusted in her.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.561
And found out Morgan was good
for nothing and she went back

18:49.628 --> 18:51.530
and told Teairra everything.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.666
Princess, make me feel like
I can't trust her no more.

18:54.733 --> 18:57.503
Trust is everything, you know,
because the minute that it's

18:57.569 --> 19:02.107
broken is the minute you got to
feel is this worth me spending

19:02.174 --> 19:03.809
the rest of my life with.

19:03.876 --> 19:06.078
If you would have ask me if me
and Princess was going to get

19:06.144 --> 19:08.614
married and have babies before
this Morgan thing happened,

19:08.680 --> 19:10.282
{\an5}I would have said, "Hell yeah."

19:10.349 --> 19:12.618
{\an5}But you know what, nothing's
more important than loyalty

19:12.684 --> 19:14.887
and Princess has not been that.

19:14.953 --> 19:17.089
Y'all be moving too fast
with these girls, man.

19:17.155 --> 19:22.394
We want wives, but we

19:22.461 --> 19:24.229
We gotta search
for what we want.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.899
What's your relationship with
Teairra like, because it just

19:26.965 --> 19:30.102
feels to me like she was the
one who was really,

19:30.168 --> 19:31.870
really down for you.

19:31.937 --> 19:34.139
I told you my family
was Teairra lovers.

19:34.206 --> 19:35.374
And you know what,
when I think about it,

19:35.440 --> 19:37.142
there's a reason for that.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.244
Teairra and I, we broke
up because she had

19:39.311 --> 19:40.846
violent tendencies.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.448
But Teairra always
stayed loyal too.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.851
She always stayed down
and she always keep it 100.

19:45.918 --> 19:48.120
Despite the good, the bad and
the ugly, she was more

19:48.186 --> 19:49.354
of a friend for you.

19:49.421 --> 19:52.157
Yeah, she was a friend
and I hurt her real bad.

19:52.224 --> 19:56.094
What you looking for in
life right now is a friend.

I got my mom, I got my dad,
I got my sister,

19:58.897 --> 20:01.934
I got Snoop, I got everybody
talking about Teairra.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.570
And now that I think about
it, I'm thinking about her too.

20:04.636 --> 20:07.339
Is that the power of suggestion,
or was she just looking that

20:07.406 --> 20:11.843
good at Yung Berg's party, or am
I waking up from a spell saying,

20:11.910 --> 20:14.246
"What the [bleep] have I done?"

When I look back into time, I go
damn, when I was with Teairra,

20:19.151 --> 20:21.053
it was a whole
different kind of thing.

20:21.119 --> 20:24.523
She keep popping back
up in my [bleep] head.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.091
She ain't popping up by
accident, it's because

20:26.158 --> 20:28.994
she meant for you.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.129
[bleep], I've got a lot
of thinking to do, man.

No, no, no.

{\an5}Fatherhood has really
shifted my paradigm.

24:32.003 --> 24:35.473
{\an5}I never really fully understood
when people would meet me

24:35.540 --> 24:37.275
and they would show
me their kids.

24:37.342 --> 24:38.710
I get it now.

24:38.777 --> 24:41.446
And you know, it's contributing,
in the best way, to my career.

24:41.513 --> 24:44.850

I'm happy that I get to get back
in and play this music.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.794

Drew called me and said

{\an5}he wants to meet at the beach.

27:09.160 --> 27:12.731
{\an5}I'm slightly confused as to what
it is he can possibly say to me

27:12.797 --> 27:14.866
after the way he acted
the last time we met.

27:14.933 --> 27:17.969
Last time we talked it was just
really all bad and I don't feel

27:18.036 --> 27:20.271
like we really got anywhere.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.873
I don't feel like we
ever get anywhere.

27:21.940 --> 27:23.041
Uh huh.

27:23.108 --> 27:26.111
I don't want us to be
arguing all the time.

27:26.177 --> 27:28.680
There was a point where
we did love each other.

27:28.747 --> 27:30.382
And I feel like if we can
get back to that point,

27:30.448 --> 27:32.717
it'll be healthy for Cameron.

27:32.784 --> 27:34.953
How do you suggest we
get back to that point?

27:35.020 --> 27:37.355
Really for us to just
let go of the past.

27:37.422 --> 27:40.058
We never really
properly addressed how

27:40.125 --> 27:41.726
we hurt each other.

27:41.793 --> 27:43.094
That's what makes it hard
for me to move on with

27:43.161 --> 27:45.597
anyone in my life.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.332
I think that's something that
you're really going to

27:47.399 --> 27:49.100
have to work on.

27:49.167 --> 27:51.169
Drew hurt me so bad that for a
few months after we broke up

27:51.236 --> 27:53.371
I was convinced that
I was a lesbian.

27:53.438 --> 27:55.974
He left me in such an emotional
wreck that, you know, four years

27:56.041 --> 27:59.277
later I still can't open up to
or trust another human being.

there's some [bleep]

28:01.980 --> 28:03.381
we need to deal with.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.650
But if talking about our past
prevents us from a peaceful

28:05.717 --> 28:09.521
future, then I'll put my needs
aside for the sake of our son

28:09.587 --> 28:11.823
and I'll make due with
venting to my therapist.

28:11.890 --> 28:14.626
Everybody's family has their bad
moments and their good moments.

28:14.692 --> 28:17.228
But at the end of the day
you're tied, you're family.

28:17.295 --> 28:20.432
So, I want to say that I
apologize for the last time

28:20.498 --> 28:22.700
we met up and I came at you.

with all the Princess BS.

party and dumped it out
