a summer research program
at the University of Heidelberg,

00:09.600 --> 00:11.190

00:11.390 --> 00:12.580
Heidelberg, Germany?

00:12.780 --> 00:14.630
Yes, and they're doing
exciting work

00:14.830 --> 00:16.540

00:16.740 --> 00:18.980
Well, that would certainly help
my grad school applications.

That's money making

00:36.590 --> 00:37.960
Yeah, 'cause that's
how people want

00:38.150 --> 00:40.390
their clothes to smell--
like hot dogs.

00:40.590 --> 00:41.960
I love how hot dogs smell.

And?I nixed it.

You nixed it?

cover our expenses as well?
