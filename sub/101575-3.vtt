00:12.012 --> 00:14.222
[narrator] <i>Previously on</i>
Star Trek Discovery:

00:15.348 --> 00:16.850
[Burnham] Identify space time location.

00:16.933 --> 00:20.145
[android] You have reached year 3188.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.565
It was not my intention to crash
into your ship. I am sorry.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.025
You ever gonna tell me your name?

00:25.400 --> 00:26.317
My name's Book.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.862
The Federation is gone?

00:29.195 --> 00:32.532
-What happened?
-Collapsed, I guess, after the Burn.

00:32.741 --> 00:33.658
What's the Burn?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.536
[Book] Dilithium.
One day, most of it just went boom.

00:37.954 --> 00:40.999
The thing is you got no authority here.

00:41.082 --> 00:44.294
Whereas the Burn was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:44.669 --> 00:47.797
All that matters now is dilithium.

00:48.965 --> 00:49.883
Welcome to Starfleet.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.010
I need to locate
the warp signature of a Starship,

00:52.093 --> 00:54.387
with the identifier NCC-1031.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.389
Something is coming toward us.
Something big.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.600
Enemy vessel right on top of us.

00:59.642 --> 01:02.020
-And we're being hailed.
-[Saru] Open a channel, Mr. Bryce.

01:04.898 --> 01:05.857
[Burnham] <i>Saru!</i>

01:06.316 --> 01:09.903
<i>I landed here a year ago.</i>
<i>I've been waiting for all of you.</i>

01:10.695 --> 01:11.821
<i>All this time.</i>

01:17.911 --> 01:20.371
[Burnham] <i>Personal log,</i>
<i>Commander Michael Burnham.</i>

01:20.789 --> 01:23.625
<i>Stardate 865211.3.</i>

01:24.042 --> 01:26.252
<i>Automatic transmission to </i>USS Discovery.

01:26.836 --> 01:28.880
<i>Wherever or whenever it might be,</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:32.258
<i>I'm sending this message because you need</i>
<i>to know what I've learned here.</i>

01:32.550 --> 01:35.470
<i>I hope that by some miracle,</i>
<i>you'll receive it someday.</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:40.141
<i>Seven hundred years after we left,</i>
<i>dilithium supplies dried up.</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:42.602
<i>The Federation tried</i>
<i>alternative warp drive designs,</i>

01:42.685 --> 01:44.395
<i>but none proved reliable.</i>

01:44.479 --> 01:46.356
<i>Then came the Burn.</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:49.526
<i>No one knows how or why it happened,</i>

01:49.609 --> 01:52.570
<i>but in an instant,</i>
<i>all dilithium went inert.</i>

01:52.654 --> 01:55.281
<i>Any ship with an active</i>
<i>warp core detonated.</i>

01:57.700 --> 02:00.203
<i>The Federation as we know it</i>
<i>disappeared overnight.</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:03.206
<i>It's now just a shadow of its former self.</i>

02:04.457 --> 02:06.709
<i>We didn't give everything</i>
<i>for this version of the future,</i>

02:06.793 --> 02:09.254
<i>and I'll be damned if I let it stand.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:11.881
<i>I've become a courier.</i>

02:11.965 --> 02:14.592
<i>I transport goods</i>
<i>in exchange for dilithium</i>

02:14.676 --> 02:16.427
<i>to keep exploring sector by sector,</i>

02:17.095 --> 02:20.098
<i>searching for clues</i>
<i>as to what caused the Burn.</i>

02:20.807 --> 02:24.185
<i>Answers that might help</i>
<i>bring the Federation together again.</i>

02:25.937 --> 02:28.815
<i>Wherever I go, I look for you, my friends.</i>

02:29.524 --> 02:31.943
<i>I listen for any sign of your arrival,</i>

02:32.485 --> 02:35.155
<i>but communication remains</i>
<i>severely limited.</i>

02:35.905 --> 02:38.992
<i>Even if I did find you,</i>
<i>I know it would be different,</i>

02:39.075 --> 02:41.411
<i>because I am different.</i>

02:42.287 --> 02:43.746
<i>But I will always love you,</i>

02:44.497 --> 02:47.083
<i>I've had to accept</i>
<i>I may never see you again.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:50.170
<i>You can love someone</i>
<i>and still let them go.</i>

02:51.171 --> 02:52.505
[engine whirring]

02:54.257 --> 02:56.175
<i>It feels like a dream, this world.</i>

02:57.760 --> 03:02.390
<i>A strange, terrible, beautiful dream.</i>

03:08.730 --> 03:11.274
[computer] <i>Combat simulation, complete.</i>

03:12.817 --> 03:15.320
[Burnham] <i>Luckily, I'm not alone</i>
<i>on this journey.</i>

03:16.070 --> 03:19.449
<i>I found a friend</i>
<i>in the truest sense of the word.</i>

03:20.283 --> 03:22.327
<i>This is my life now, and I...</i>

03:22.410 --> 03:24.120
[beeping]

03:44.307 --> 03:45.141
Hi.

04:32.772 --> 04:36.276
I cannot imagine
what this year has been for you.

04:38.027 --> 04:39.779
I couldn't have imagined it either.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.198
How is everyone?

04:43.241 --> 04:44.617
Grateful for each other.

04:45.285 --> 04:49.497
They are finding ways to grasp
the enormity of what we have done.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.625
Some more successful than others.

04:53.334 --> 04:54.168
And you?

04:55.920 --> 04:56.754
How are you?

04:57.505 --> 05:01.551
Kelpiens have always
had a deep understanding of fear and loss.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.637
Perhaps that prepared me for this.

05:06.597 --> 05:09.642
I do not like to think
that you were alone all this time.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.062
Oh, the ship that pulled you out
of the ice belongs to a friend.

05:13.396 --> 05:14.397
He's a courier...

05:15.231 --> 05:17.275
and we work together sometimes.

05:17.650 --> 05:18.901
You have been a courier?

05:19.235 --> 05:21.446
It was the only way
to scrounge up any information.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.906
I sent a transmission to Terralysium.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.992
Took months to get a response.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.619
And they had never heard of my mom.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.792
I promised Book some dilithium
for getting me here.

05:35.001 --> 05:35.835
Book?

05:35.918 --> 05:37.837
Oh, Cleveland Booker. My friend.

05:39.005 --> 05:39.922
Is he from Earth?

05:40.256 --> 05:42.383
No, but it's the name, right?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.803
There has to be a story there.
I haven't gotten it out of him yet.

05:46.262 --> 05:48.389
We will honor your arrangement, of course,

05:48.473 --> 05:51.350
and I will offer Mr. Booker
my sincerest appreciation.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.603
Welcome back, commander.

05:58.232 --> 06:03.446
Nobody knows... if the Burn
was an accident

06:04.363 --> 06:05.531
or a natural disaster,

06:06.282 --> 06:12.622
but it appears that devastation flashed
in an instant across all known space.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.123
That's impossible.

06:14.540 --> 06:17.168
Nothing could affect
all dilithium all at once.

06:17.835 --> 06:21.297
Says a man who jumps a starship
through mushroom-space.

06:21.589 --> 06:22.423
How many?

06:25.301 --> 06:26.135
How many died?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.347
Millions.

06:35.228 --> 06:38.147
I wish I could tell you
how much of the Federation remains.

06:40.024 --> 06:43.778
But I did find part of a transmission
from an obsolete Starfleet channel. Bryce.

06:45.696 --> 06:47.907
[Tal on recording]
<i>This is Admiral Senna Tal.</i>

06:47.990 --> 06:50.952
<i>I will wait for any</i>
<i>who would join us on Earth,</i>

06:51.410 --> 06:53.246
<i>anyone who still believes in us.</i>

06:53.412 --> 06:56.332
<i>The Federation lives on,</i>
<i>but we need your--</i>

06:56.499 --> 06:59.168
-Is he at Starfleet Headquarters?
-[Burnham] Not sure.

06:59.585 --> 07:01.087
That message was 12 years ago.

07:01.379 --> 07:03.589
And Earth was always
too far away for me to reach.

07:05.091 --> 07:07.426
But now with the spore drive,
we can get there.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.971
We will find Admiral Tal,

07:10.638 --> 07:12.223
and help him begin the process.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.893
We should jump to outside
of Earth's scanning range,

07:16.519 --> 07:18.938
pose as a starship
that was stranded by the Burn,

07:19.272 --> 07:21.023
trying to head home at sub-light speed.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.985
I see your little walkabout
has taught you a thing or two.

07:24.819 --> 07:25.653
I like that.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.864
It is a wise strategy.

07:28.239 --> 07:29.240
So, um...

07:30.199 --> 07:31.033
shall I go?

07:33.744 --> 07:36.914
Commander Burnham, I believe we are due
for a conversation. Perhaps--

07:36.998 --> 07:38.791
Oh, no, no, no. There's no need.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.334
But we agreed to discuss--

07:40.418 --> 07:41.669
No, it's-- It's--

07:42.211 --> 07:43.963
It's you, Saru.

07:44.922 --> 07:45.882
Uh...

07:46.716 --> 07:48.384
[Burnham] And chain of command
dictates it.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.512
I don't know if it's ever been me.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.395
You brought this ship through time.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.733
You carried this crew on your shoulders.

08:13.117 --> 08:16.037
You are a captain
in the truest sense of the word.

08:20.708 --> 08:22.335
It would be my honor.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.897
This ship... bears the name <i>Discovery.</i>

08:43.231 --> 08:46.359
Never has that been more fitting
or more prescient.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.612
She has carried us into the future,

08:50.321 --> 08:56.118
and it will be our privilege
to make that future... bright.

09:05.169 --> 09:06.087
Let us begin.

09:07.338 --> 09:08.172
Together.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.424
Aye, captain!

11:08.793 --> 11:10.461
[woman over PA] <i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:14.215
<i>Lockdown drills for Deck 7</i>
<i>have been canceled until further notice.</i>

11:18.511 --> 11:19.345
Hey.

11:21.722 --> 11:22.556
[Burnham] You okay?

11:24.850 --> 11:28.354
We haven't even had a chance
to say goodbye to the friends we lost.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.064
Not to mention...

11:31.440 --> 11:32.274
my mom...

11:35.319 --> 11:36.445
my cousins, my--

11:36.529 --> 11:37.530
Everybody back home.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.283
I mean, what they-- Got breakfast, they...

11:43.244 --> 11:46.080
were late for work, they had kids.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.418
I mean, they had whole lives...

11:52.461 --> 11:53.337
and they're gone.

11:56.298 --> 11:58.134
Now they've been gone for centuries.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.679
I keep thinking there has got
to be something on Earth

12:01.762 --> 12:03.180
that we'll recognize right?

12:05.182 --> 12:07.101
I don't know, the Gateway Arch, maybe?

12:08.561 --> 12:09.895
The Giza Pyramids?

12:11.897 --> 12:13.399
Homemade hummingbird cake?

12:15.067 --> 12:16.193
Cake is eternal.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.029
[laughs]

12:19.113 --> 12:19.947
Cake is eternal.

12:22.741 --> 12:24.827
I always knew that I would see you again.

12:26.662 --> 12:28.873
Yeah, I keep having this, like,
image of you.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.208
You're, like, holding a dandelion...

12:32.585 --> 12:33.669
and you blow on it...

12:34.670 --> 12:37.465
and the seeds they... go.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.635
You let us go.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.596
Didn't you?

12:50.186 --> 12:51.395
It's okay.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.111
Time travel, man.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.905
Oh.

13:03.824 --> 13:07.495
Look, I may not know you,
but like I know you.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.873
Okay? So, whatever, I love your hair.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.417
[laughs]

13:14.001 --> 13:15.544
-Thank you.
-[laughs]

13:16.545 --> 13:19.298
You do seem, like, lighter...

13:20.007 --> 13:20.841
somehow.

13:21.800 --> 13:22.843
Hmm.

13:22.927 --> 13:25.679
[Stamets over comm] <i>Tilly, I'm still</i>
<i>waiting for that recalibration kit.</i>

13:25.763 --> 13:28.057
-Well, some things never change.
-Yeah.

13:31.268 --> 13:33.020
Go, I have to meet someone anyways.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.272
Okay.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.372
[Georgiou] Welcome aboard.

13:53.916 --> 13:54.917
You're not Detmer...

13:56.377 --> 13:57.211
or Tilly.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.088
I'd rather kill myself.

13:59.421 --> 14:00.673
You're Philippa Georgiou.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.550
Michael warned me about you.

14:02.967 --> 14:03.842
Did you listen?

14:04.218 --> 14:07.137
Apparently not enough. Is there a reason
we're having this conversation?

14:07.388 --> 14:09.348
I like to see who's come aboard my ship

14:09.431 --> 14:11.809
after gallivanting
through space with Michael.

14:11.892 --> 14:12.726
Gallivanting.

14:13.519 --> 14:15.479
If only I'd known. Where is she?

14:15.729 --> 14:16.730
Your girlfriend?

14:17.314 --> 14:18.524
She's not my girlfriend.

14:21.026 --> 14:21.860
No, really.

14:22.444 --> 14:25.155
She's not. We didn't have-- Nope, nope.

14:26.115 --> 14:29.118
We're not talking about this.
Answer my question.

14:29.451 --> 14:31.579
In another world,
I might have said Michael

14:31.662 --> 14:34.582
is somewhere being earnest
and doing the right thing.

14:35.165 --> 14:36.000
In this one...

14:37.501 --> 14:38.586
I'm not so sure.

14:44.842 --> 14:46.927
[Book] My oh my, oh my, oh my.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.013
If they could see what I'm seeing.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.139
Who?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.223
Who?

14:51.932 --> 14:52.766
Any of them.

14:53.726 --> 14:58.314
Come on. You could run a sector,
two sectors, a dozen even.

15:04.361 --> 15:05.362
You brought me back.

15:07.823 --> 15:09.366
Is it weird to say I knew you would?

15:09.658 --> 15:12.703
No... because you'd have done
the same thing.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.333
Does it feel like home?

15:19.460 --> 15:20.461
It's familiar...

15:21.629 --> 15:22.463
but...

15:24.548 --> 15:25.382
far away.

15:26.383 --> 15:28.719
Do you feel like
you owe these folks something?

15:29.053 --> 15:31.680
Because, if you do, you know, that's fine.

15:32.598 --> 15:36.101
But remember,
you already jumped through a wormhole.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.275
Someone's eventually gonna find out
about this stash you have.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.487
Yeah. <i>Discovery </i>will be a target.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.239
You, too.

15:50.240 --> 15:51.951
You pissed off some scary people.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.077
You helped.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.370
Thank you.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.081
Is there anyone here we could piss off?

15:59.667 --> 16:01.460
[Burnham] You could come with us to Earth.

16:02.169 --> 16:05.798
-So, we can piss off an entire planet?
-Just the opposite, you'd be safe.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.174
No one can find you out that far.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.343
I believe in what I do, Michael.

16:10.010 --> 16:11.387
I can't just give it up.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.264
[Burnham] There can be more transforms
out there in need of your help.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.476
Bollocks.
I mean, yeah, there might be, but...

16:18.018 --> 16:18.936
Clean slate.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.772
Ah. And what do you get out of the deal?

16:24.900 --> 16:27.319
We could use your help
masking all the dilithium.

16:28.445 --> 16:29.863
We, as in <i>Discovery?</i>

16:32.282 --> 16:33.867
What "we" are you really talking about?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.412
Shush.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.748
I've learned by now
it's a lost cause trying to say no to you.

16:41.542 --> 16:42.835
I've never been to Earth.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.422
I've never been to this one.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.634
[Burnham] <i>Book's ship</i>
<i>can cloak our dilithium.</i>

16:50.718 --> 16:52.177
<i>It's the safest choice.</i>

16:52.261 --> 16:55.681
[Saru] <i>I cannot place our entire dilithium</i>
<i>supply into the hands of a stranger.</i>

16:55.764 --> 16:57.641
[Burnham] We don't have
another option, captain.

16:58.058 --> 17:03.105
I must admit, commander, I am having
some difficulty trusting your judgment.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.277
I am grateful
for your support of my captaincy,

17:08.861 --> 17:12.573
but your refusal
to even consider the possibility...

17:14.241 --> 17:15.492
surprised me.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.704
This past year
has altered your perspective.

17:18.787 --> 17:20.539
I'm the same person, Saru.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.086
And I'm not.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.591
As I am now responsible
for every life on this ship,

17:30.758 --> 17:34.219
and as I had intended to offer you
the position as my Number One...

17:35.804 --> 17:37.598
I must insist you explain.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.354
[sighs]

17:44.855 --> 17:49.026
Everything that we dedicated our lives to
disappeared into madness.

17:50.611 --> 17:53.989
We thought we could imagine a future
and it turns out we were wrong.

17:54.740 --> 17:55.741
I adapted.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.703
And I did what I had to,
to learn as much as I could

17:59.870 --> 18:01.455
about what happened and why.

18:02.706 --> 18:03.957
I just need some time.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.673
Book's ship can stay in the shuttle bay
as long as it has our dilithium.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.431
It will remain under guard...

18:20.140 --> 18:22.142
and he will not be permitted to board it

18:22.226 --> 18:25.395
until we reach Earth
and the dilithium has been safely removed.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.991
[Saru over PA] <i>Prepare to jump to Earth.</i>

18:38.867 --> 18:41.995
Auxiliary power system
and primary computer systems are online.

18:42.079 --> 18:43.664
Impulse engines online.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.125
-Weapons systems fully operational.
-Communications online.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.710
Warp core stable and functional,
but powered down.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.590
[door opens]

18:58.137 --> 18:59.972
Welcome to the bridge, Mr. Booker.

19:00.222 --> 19:03.725
And thank you for bringing
Commander Burnham home to us.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.320
Commander Stamets, status report?

19:15.696 --> 19:18.407
[Stamets over PA] <i>Spore drive is</i>
<i>online and ready to go, captain.</i>

19:20.742 --> 19:21.952
Black alert, please.

19:38.552 --> 19:39.761
Oh, shit!

19:40.929 --> 19:43.307
Hey, you didn't tell me
about the spinning part, huh?

19:43.390 --> 19:45.517
Coordinates relative
to galactic core confirmed.

19:45.601 --> 19:48.270
Initiating multi-phasic scans
and updating astrometric data.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.272
Approaching visual range, sir.

19:51.607 --> 19:52.691
There she is.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.122
[Saru] Increase magnification, please.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.292
Mr. Rhys, what are those arrays?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.879
They seem to be some form
of advanced force field generators.

20:21.762 --> 20:24.181
Sir, two vessels approaching
from Earth's orbit.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.849
They do not bear Starfleet registries.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.309
Shields up. Red alert.

20:27.392 --> 20:28.810
[alarm wailing]

20:29.102 --> 20:30.062
Sir, we're being hailed.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.480
Put them through.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.028
<i>A view screen, how quaint.</i>

20:38.737 --> 20:41.907
<i>I am Captain Ndoye</i>
<i>of the United Earth Defense Force.</i>

20:42.324 --> 20:47.287
<i>Your vessel has violated</i>
<i>regulations C-1922 and F-031</i>

20:47.371 --> 20:49.998
<i>of the UE charter</i>
<i>by reaching earth's perimeter.</i>

20:50.540 --> 20:52.709
<i>Leave immediately.</i>
<i>You are not welcome here.</i>

21:04.554 --> 21:07.557
I am Captain Saru of the <i>USS Discovery.</i>

21:07.641 --> 21:12.479
We are a Starfleet vessel and unfamiliar
with the United Earth Defense Force.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.564
Are you a branch of the Federation?

21:14.731 --> 21:16.358
<i>Your ship is not in our records.</i>

21:16.650 --> 21:20.946
<i>Discovery</i> was on a long-term
classified scientific expedition.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.740
We are the descendants
of its original crew.

21:24.074 --> 21:26.702
<i>And you've continued to function</i>
<i>as a Starfleet vessel?</i>

21:27.202 --> 21:28.036
We have.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.748
We wish to contact a Starfleet officer
whose message we received.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.375
Earth was its point of origin.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.128
<i>Your vessel's configuration and metallurgy</i>

21:36.211 --> 21:38.839
<i>suggest 23rd to 25th century construction.</i>

21:39.840 --> 21:42.426
<i>I find it quite odd</i>
<i>that it remains in service.</i>

21:43.468 --> 21:46.555
There is no need to replace
that which is not broken.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.141
<i>How did your ship survive the Burn?</i>

21:50.392 --> 21:51.768
It was not at warp at the time.

21:52.894 --> 21:54.521
<i>For us to consider your request,</i>

21:54.604 --> 21:57.357
<i>your ship and crew</i>
<i>will undergo a mandatory inspection.</i>

21:57.691 --> 22:00.652
<i>Any evidence of piracy</i>
<i>will be dealt with severely.</i>

22:00.736 --> 22:01.778
[Saru] Piracy?

22:02.446 --> 22:06.199
Very well, Captain Ndoye.
We will prepare for your arrival.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.576
We are beaming aboard now.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.581
Don't move.

22:15.959 --> 22:18.086
Hey! What the hell is this?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.547
Don't touch that. Excuse me. Hey!

22:20.714 --> 22:21.548
Who are you?

22:24.551 --> 22:25.385
Put these on.

22:27.095 --> 22:29.139
-Why?
-They're searching the ship.

22:30.015 --> 22:32.851
If anyone is not in full uniform,
they'll be suspect.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.102
They could be arrested.

22:34.394 --> 22:36.855
I see Earth's about as tolerant
as any place else.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.409
What is this? Whatever.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.622
-You're Lieutenant Booker now.
-Aye, aye, commander.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.373
One "aye." We're not pirates.

22:57.667 --> 23:00.796
Remember that time when I had
to wade through that bog on Ikasu

23:00.879 --> 23:02.255
to pull those leeches off you?

23:02.339 --> 23:03.882
Yes, when we saved each other.

23:03.965 --> 23:07.302
Nope, I saved you.
And this is worse than the bog.

23:07.385 --> 23:08.220
Ugh.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.555
[Saru over PA] <i>Attention,</i>
<i>all </i>Discovery <i>crew members.</i>

23:10.639 --> 23:12.432
<i>We are undergoing inspection.</i>

23:12.682 --> 23:15.143
<i>Your cooperation is expected. Thank you.</i>

23:17.854 --> 23:19.022
Okay. Go on.

23:19.106 --> 23:20.524
Mm-hm.

23:34.037 --> 23:34.996
Just a uniform.

23:36.123 --> 23:36.957
No, it isn't.

23:37.415 --> 23:40.335
[chuckles] You've been playing
the long game.

23:40.544 --> 23:43.004
-To get you to join Starfleet?
-To see me in this outfit.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.507
Look, you will be in your own clothes
and on your own ship

23:45.590 --> 23:48.218
and petting your fat cat in no time.

23:48.301 --> 23:49.886
How many times have I told you?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.721
-She's a queen.
-She's a queen.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.892
-Oh, you're funny. Yeah.
-I am.

23:56.351 --> 23:59.062
After you, Lieutenant Booker.

23:59.437 --> 24:00.647
Aye, Commander Burnham.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.983
I'll go blend in.

24:03.900 --> 24:05.443
[Burnham] <i>Seriously? Admiral?</i>

24:06.069 --> 24:07.487
I had to make it believable.

24:08.321 --> 24:11.199
You don't look so thrilled
to be back in uniform yourself.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.410
I just forgot what it felt like.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.954
Once you've grown
used to living by your own rules,

24:16.037 --> 24:18.206
not so easy
to follow other people's, is it?

24:18.498 --> 24:20.584
Why are you still on <i>Discovery, </i>Philippa?

24:20.667 --> 24:21.501
Why are you?

24:23.128 --> 24:24.754
I see it in your eyes, Michael.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.507
You've tasted freedom
that you never even thought was possible.

24:27.591 --> 24:30.760
Freedom from the obligations
of what others needed you to be.

24:31.052 --> 24:32.971
I'm not sure you ever knew
who you really were

24:33.054 --> 24:36.725
without someone else to tell you,
but you're starting to.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.520
And this place
no longer feels like your place.

24:42.189 --> 24:43.398
Am I getting warm?

24:43.648 --> 24:45.734
[woman over PA]
<i>Commander Burnham to the ready room.</i>

24:47.068 --> 24:52.741
We believed Earth would be a safe harbor,
a place where we would feel welcome.

24:52.991 --> 24:56.036
But we arrived to find you suspicious

24:56.119 --> 24:58.997
of a starship that hails
from your own planet.

24:59.873 --> 25:02.709
May I ask what you were
defending yourselves from?

25:03.960 --> 25:05.754
Everyone lost someone to the Burn.

25:06.713 --> 25:10.258
We had to focus
on what we still had, our planet.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.678
We rebuilt Earth to be self-sustainable,

25:13.762 --> 25:17.474
all while being under near constant siege
by dilithium raiders.

25:17.891 --> 25:21.645
The most recent wave is led by
a tenacious individual named Wen.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.232
He is relentless, targeting our ships.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.943
He would take our dilithium at any cost.

25:28.151 --> 25:32.405
I assure you, we have no ties
with this Wen or any other raiders.

25:32.572 --> 25:35.450
Many of our crew consider Earth
their ancestral home.

25:35.825 --> 25:38.662
Yes, captain, all we want is
to check in with Starfleet Command.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.706
You have been away a long time.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.377
I'm afraid you won't find
what you're looking for here.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.464
The Federation and Starfleet
haven't been on Earth for a hundred years.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.842
Where have they gone?

25:53.426 --> 25:54.344
No one knows.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.472
Most of the ships destroyed in the Burn
were Federation.

25:57.847 --> 26:01.476
No one knew if it was an attack and if so,
whether it would happen again.

26:01.935 --> 26:05.480
Having Federation Headquarters on Earth
made it a potential target.

26:05.563 --> 26:06.940
I do not understand.

26:07.983 --> 26:10.235
Earth is no longer part of the Federation?

26:10.610 --> 26:13.029
Why should we be?
We can take care of ourselves.

26:18.576 --> 26:21.538
What about the Starfleet officer
who sent the transmission I received?

26:21.663 --> 26:23.248
That was just 12 years ago.

26:23.748 --> 26:24.666
What was the name?

26:24.874 --> 26:26.209
Admiral Senna Tal.

26:30.588 --> 26:32.257
Admiral Tal was on Earth,

26:32.841 --> 26:35.760
but he died on an outbound ship
two years ago.

26:36.386 --> 26:37.929
Its destination isn't listed.

26:39.431 --> 26:40.265
I'm sorry.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.234
[Tilly] Ah!

26:53.403 --> 26:56.239
-Hey, that's highly sensitive.
-Stand back.

27:00.618 --> 27:03.997
Is this how it's gonna be?
I thought Earth would feel like home.

27:04.080 --> 27:06.708
-You're not listening to me.
-What are you doing? Don't touch that.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.085
Why is that cube connected
to your bridge controls?

27:09.502 --> 27:12.839
This is a science research vessel.
I'm an astromycologist.

27:12.922 --> 27:14.966
I use the cube
for controlled spore reactions,

27:15.258 --> 27:17.510
which requires
coordination with the bridge.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.512
This science vessel's
practically a museum.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.765
Okay, well, museums are cool, so...

27:21.848 --> 27:24.142
That's what someone
who lives in a museum would say.

27:24.559 --> 27:27.604
-I don't live in a museum.
-How old are you, 17?

27:27.687 --> 27:28.521
Sixteen.

27:28.605 --> 27:32.359
Would you please remove your
16-year-old fingers from my life's work?

27:32.442 --> 27:33.401
What did I say?

27:33.485 --> 27:34.944
This is an interface.

27:35.028 --> 27:38.031
Okay, we get it, you're smart.
Everybody here is smart!

27:38.239 --> 27:41.951
Adira, our job is to inspect, not engage.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.453
We're done here.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.375
[alarm wailing]

27:51.795 --> 27:54.422
-[Saru] Report.
-Five unidentified vessels incoming.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.549
They're powering up advanced phasers.

27:56.633 --> 27:57.801
Those are Wen's ships.

27:58.343 --> 28:00.512
His raiders are always scanning
for targets.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.889
-They are hailing us, sir.
-Do not respond.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.432
Dialogue is an effective strategy.

28:04.516 --> 28:08.520
-We know our enemy. Do not respond.
-You have no jurisdiction on my bridge.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.230
Put them through, Mr. Bryce.

28:12.232 --> 28:15.777
<i>Federation vessel,</i>
<i>surrender your dilithium immediately.</i>

28:15.860 --> 28:18.571
Scan us, we have no dilithium on board.

28:18.863 --> 28:22.158
<i>The speed with which you appear</i>
<i>in sensor range tells me something else.</i>

28:22.242 --> 28:25.078
<i>Surrender or we will take</i>
<i>what we need by force.</i>

28:26.162 --> 28:27.872
Your request to visit Earth is denied.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.792
Leave orbit immediately.
We'll deal with Wen ourselves.

28:31.334 --> 28:34.462
Inspectors, this is Captain Ndoye.
Cease all activities and return.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.839
[man over comm] <i>Sir, we can't.</i>

28:35.922 --> 28:38.091
<i>Something is interfering</i>
<i>with our transport.</i>

28:38.258 --> 28:39.259
What?

28:42.011 --> 28:43.012
This is sabotage.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.307
We are a Starfleet vessel
and would never utilize sabotage

28:46.391 --> 28:48.059
against the Federation's home planet.

28:48.309 --> 28:52.188
We will find the cause of the transporter
interference and handle Wen.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.232
His fight is with us, not you.

28:54.566 --> 28:58.278
Then take that fight away from our orbit
or we'll shoot them out of the sky

28:58.361 --> 29:00.864
and you will have started a war
in the name of Starfleet.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.165
[door opens]

29:11.040 --> 29:12.083
Tell me you saved the day.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.002
I have a plan.

29:14.544 --> 29:16.504
-Yes.
-Remember Donatu Seven?

29:16.838 --> 29:18.214
-No.
-You do so.

29:18.465 --> 29:19.632
Yes, okay.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.344
But I'm trying to forget.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.346
We need to get to your ship.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.682
Unless you wanna keep brooding
into your synthehol.

29:27.849 --> 29:28.683
Synthehol?

29:28.767 --> 29:29.726
Mm.

29:30.852 --> 29:31.686
Damn.

29:32.061 --> 29:35.106
And here I am trying to get a buzz on
and reach a place of existential despair.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.108
-You coming?
-Yes.

29:37.358 --> 29:38.610
I'm worried about my cat.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.779
Don't you have to ask for permission?

29:40.945 --> 29:42.197
I'll apologize after.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.407
Okay, Donatu Seven.

29:44.949 --> 29:46.868
I'm sober, maybe it'll work this time.

29:48.912 --> 29:51.039
[Tilly] You're right. That's not our tech.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.290
Okay.

29:53.374 --> 29:56.294
It's accessing
our deflector shield systems.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.588
Which is allowing it
to block the beaming frequencies

29:58.671 --> 30:00.799
of the inspector's personal transporters.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.760
And there's a fail-safe,
so, if we had to try to disable it,

30:03.968 --> 30:06.095
our shield systems will shut down, too.

30:06.179 --> 30:07.847
It's gonna take hours
to find a workaround.

30:08.014 --> 30:10.517
I knew that tween menace
was up to something.

30:10.725 --> 30:13.311
-She did this while we were yelling.
-She's not even a tween menace.

30:13.394 --> 30:14.896
She's a frigging teen genius.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.398
I mean, I was an engineering whiz
when I was her age, trust me,

30:17.482 --> 30:18.775
but this would require knowledge

30:18.858 --> 30:21.319
of the inner workings
of a 900-year-old Starship.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.530
And she identified
that our bridge controls

30:23.613 --> 30:25.865
are connected to the spore cube
with barely a glance.

30:25.949 --> 30:28.785
She was watching the others to make sure
that they weren't watching her.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.328
She must have been working alone.

30:30.578 --> 30:32.121
What's the point in sabotaging our ship?

30:32.205 --> 30:35.124
She's just trapping
her own people on board.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.877
Maybe she was buying herself some time?

30:37.961 --> 30:40.129
How do you get a teen genius to fess up?

30:41.422 --> 30:42.924
Give her some of your weird mushrooms.

30:43.341 --> 30:44.175
Who are you?

30:47.262 --> 30:50.098
[Bryce] <i>I'm sorry, sir. The raider vessels</i>
<i>aren't responding to our hails.</i>

30:50.348 --> 30:52.725
I'm detecting an unauthorized departure
from the shuttle bay.

30:52.809 --> 30:54.060
It's Booker's ship.

30:54.310 --> 30:55.520
It's no longer cloaked.

30:55.728 --> 30:58.231
There are two humanoid life signs
on board and...

31:01.818 --> 31:02.902
Go ahead, lieutenant.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.737
They have our dilithium.

31:05.780 --> 31:06.614
[Ndoye] Dilithium?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.742
The future looks darker
and darker for you.

31:09.826 --> 31:13.663
Captain Ndoye, I said I would handle
Wen and I intend to do so.

31:14.497 --> 31:16.541
Burnham is on that ship, with Booker.

31:16.875 --> 31:17.792
Lieutenant Detmer.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.336
Where are they headed?

31:20.837 --> 31:23.381
-Straight towards the raiders, sir.
-Hail Commander Burnham.

31:24.090 --> 31:26.259
No, if she responds to your hails,

31:26.342 --> 31:28.386
the raiders will think
that she's working for you,

31:28.469 --> 31:29.971
and that would ruin her advantage.

31:30.054 --> 31:31.723
Advantage for what exactly?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.808
My guess is she's thinking
like one of them,

31:33.892 --> 31:35.935
taking what she needs
and doing what's necessary.

31:36.269 --> 31:37.604
She did not consult me.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.523
Have you heard the one about
the unstoppable force

31:40.607 --> 31:42.317
that met an immovable object?

31:44.110 --> 31:46.112
You are the object.

31:46.779 --> 31:49.616
This is Ndoye, target the vessel
approaching the raider ships.

31:49.699 --> 31:50.783
I will not permit that.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.828
Under no circumstances
can Wen obtain your dilithium.

31:57.540 --> 31:59.334
[Book] <i>Okay, these ships</i>
<i>have seen better days.</i>

31:59.417 --> 32:00.960
<i>Not the raiders we're used to.</i>

32:01.794 --> 32:02.921
[Burnham] Yeah.

32:03.212 --> 32:04.047
Hey.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.049
Let's try Orion Tango.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.301
Yeah, come on, Orion Tango's fun.

32:08.676 --> 32:10.511
-Remember that time with the--
-Feathers.

32:10.762 --> 32:11.804
I thought it was scales.

32:11.888 --> 32:14.140
Whatever they were,
I was digging them out of my hair.

32:14.223 --> 32:15.558
-[laughs]
-We could do Radok Sien.

32:15.642 --> 32:18.561
Absolutely not. How many times
do you want me to get my nose broken?

32:18.645 --> 32:21.356
My whole face swelled up
and Grudge wouldn't look at me for days.

32:21.606 --> 32:22.565
I was crushed.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.275
He's hailing us.

32:26.402 --> 32:27.236
<i>Talk fast.</i>

32:27.779 --> 32:30.323
We have what you need.
We want to make a deal. Scan our ship.

32:31.824 --> 32:33.117
That was entirely monosyllabic.

32:33.201 --> 32:34.869
-I love it when you do that.
-You're weird.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.120
You did it again.

32:37.205 --> 32:39.582
<i>Dilithium? You stole it from </i>Discovery.

32:39.666 --> 32:41.209
What do you care? We have a lot of it.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.379
We'll beam it over,
but you have to leave Earth's orbit now.

32:44.963 --> 32:45.880
<i>What's in this for you?</i>

32:45.964 --> 32:49.634
-We're peace-loving individuals.
<i>-No one simply gives away dilithium.</i>

32:50.134 --> 32:52.220
Earth's got quantum torpedoes
aimed right at us.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.639
<i>Earth hangs everyone out to dry.</i>

32:55.056 --> 32:57.767
I need to find out what they're doing.
I'm getting us out of the range.

32:57.850 --> 33:01.104
-Oh, not yet, <i>Discovery </i>will come through.
-Saru doesn't even know what we're up to.

33:01.187 --> 33:03.815
-He'll figure it out.
-Yeah, why is he gonna come and rescue us?

33:03.898 --> 33:05.483
Because he's Starfleet.

33:09.570 --> 33:11.114
[Ndoye] <i>Fire torpedoes in 30 seconds.</i>

33:11.823 --> 33:13.324
This is your last chance, captain.

33:13.408 --> 33:14.659
My people are on that ship!

33:14.742 --> 33:16.828
Your people who disobeyed a direct order.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.873
They stand down or they die.
My duty is to United Earth.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.876
She's left you only way
to protect Michael and the dilithium.

33:24.043 --> 33:25.420
We will not attack Earth.

33:25.503 --> 33:28.297
-Starfleet does not fire first.
-Fifteen seconds, captain.

33:28.798 --> 33:32.093
-You are a slow learner, Saru.
-And you are far too fast on the trigger.

33:32.260 --> 33:35.471
Lieutenant Detmer, when Earth opens fire,
we will take the hit.

33:35.555 --> 33:37.432
-Sir?
-Move us into position, lieutenant.

33:37.515 --> 33:40.935
Wait, we just recovered.
We don't know what their torpedoes can do.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.021
Shields are at full capacity.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.566
Commander Burnham has never let us
down before, she will not do so this time.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.485
-Five seconds. Four, three...
-Lieutenant Detmer, now!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.411
Sir, we've lost shields.

33:58.745 --> 34:01.581
Divert all non-essential power,
get them restored as quickly as possible.

34:01.789 --> 34:04.292
Raiders are charging their phasers
and getting ready to fire back.

34:04.375 --> 34:06.961
United Earth has a standing order
to take them down.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.714
If they have to go through you
to stop Wen, they will.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.549
Time to fight or die, captain.

34:12.508 --> 34:14.135
[Burnham] <i>Discovery</i>
can't take another hit.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.929
That means the next shot from Earth
will end you.

34:17.013 --> 34:20.600
Lower your shields and let us beam
the dilithium over and stay alive.

34:20.683 --> 34:22.894
Or fire back. Hope for the best.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.729
Either way, I'll sleep just fine.

34:28.316 --> 34:30.193
<i>Prepare to transport the dilithium.</i>

34:30.693 --> 34:33.279
[Burnham] When he lowers his shields,
we're gonna have to move fast.

34:33.821 --> 34:36.657
-Earth is preparing to fire again.
-[Saru] Come around again, lieutenant.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.659
Captain, we have no shields to defend.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.703
I have given my order.

34:40.787 --> 34:42.163
Booker's ship just cloaked itself.

34:42.789 --> 34:44.916
Captain, raiders
are powering down weapons.

34:47.502 --> 34:49.170
Wen has never backed away before.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.839
Perhaps they met an unstoppable force.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.135
-Tell your people to stand down.
-Not until I'm certain that--

34:56.969 --> 34:58.179
[Burnham] Special delivery.

35:01.390 --> 35:02.683
The dilithium is safe.

35:03.726 --> 35:06.187
His people won't fire on us
as long as we have their captain.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.775
It's time for you two to talk.

35:18.157 --> 35:21.285
[Ndoye] <i>There is no talking past the</i>
<i>damage he and his like have done.</i>

35:21.494 --> 35:24.956
Damage we've done?
Do you have any idea how much we've lost?

35:25.039 --> 35:29.001
When was the last time
your two peoples talked with one another?

35:29.252 --> 35:31.170
-They have no respect.
-They have never listened!

35:31.254 --> 35:32.213
Try.

35:32.630 --> 35:35.508
United Earth
doesn't even utilize their dilithium.

35:35.591 --> 35:37.969
They just hoard it,
while the rest of us suffer.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.513
You bring your suffering on yourselves.

35:40.596 --> 35:44.976
Maybe you should talk to one another,
face-to-face.

35:45.059 --> 35:48.563
If you don't surrender your dilithium,
my people can still take it by force.

35:48.646 --> 35:50.189
My life is not that important.

35:51.065 --> 35:52.358
[grunts]

35:53.818 --> 35:54.652
[breathing heavily]

35:55.945 --> 35:57.572
Diplomacy is so slow.

36:00.658 --> 36:01.868
[Ndoye] You're human?

36:09.834 --> 36:12.879
Perhaps it is time
to stop making assumptions...

36:13.713 --> 36:15.214
and start listening.

36:23.890 --> 36:25.391
[Stamets] I know what you did.

36:36.360 --> 36:37.445
What were you doing?

36:38.946 --> 36:42.491
The technology on this ship,
your glass cube,

36:42.575 --> 36:46.370
these spore canisters,
there's more to it than you're letting on.

36:47.371 --> 36:50.082
So, explain it to me or I'll report you.

36:50.416 --> 36:53.294
If you were going to report us,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

36:53.961 --> 36:56.464
Besides, I don't think
you want everyone knowing

36:56.547 --> 36:58.633
you're the one responsible
for the sabotage.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.468
Am I wrong?

37:01.385 --> 37:03.387
Now, you wanna show me
what you're working on?

37:06.599 --> 37:12.146
These spores are from a fungal species
called Prototaxites stellaviatori.

37:13.731 --> 37:16.776
They power an alternate form
of faster than light travel

37:16.859 --> 37:19.528
called the Displacement Activated
Spore Hub Drive.

37:19.737 --> 37:21.697
Though, no one actually calls it that.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.660
And, uh, that interface you saw?

37:26.619 --> 37:27.662
[zipper unzips]

37:29.330 --> 37:30.331
It connects to me.

37:31.165 --> 37:32.792
I'm its human navigator.

37:34.001 --> 37:35.002
[zipper zips]

37:35.086 --> 37:37.463
Are there others like you?

37:38.589 --> 37:39.757
There's no one like me.

37:42.635 --> 37:44.470
Well, I know how that feels.

37:45.763 --> 37:49.183
Um, so, your ship
wasn't stranded after the Burn.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.395
-Are you even a part of Starfleet?
-Yes.

37:53.771 --> 37:57.024
But, um... from the year 2258.

37:59.402 --> 38:00.695
That explains a lot.

38:00.778 --> 38:04.448
I mean, all the old technology
that still looks brand new, but...

38:05.825 --> 38:06.659
How?

38:07.493 --> 38:11.330
If you want any more details
then I need to know who I'm talking to,

38:11.497 --> 38:15.251
because there's also more
to you than you're letting on.

38:18.629 --> 38:22.842
I became an inspector hoping
I'd come across a Federation Starship.

38:23.926 --> 38:28.055
The sabotage was just
so I could have more time here.

38:29.724 --> 38:31.475
I just needed to make sure
I could trust you,

38:32.351 --> 38:33.978
because I want to come with you.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.439
Come with us? Why?

38:38.065 --> 38:41.610
Senna Tal, the Starfleet officer
you've been looking for?

38:43.612 --> 38:44.447
I know him.

38:50.244 --> 38:52.830
When we first scanned your ship,
it was overcrowded.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.249
Strained beyond its means.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.335
Not a typical raider ship.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.796
Our habitats on Titan are...

39:02.173 --> 39:03.007
barely livable.

39:03.716 --> 39:04.550
Titan?

39:05.384 --> 39:09.388
That was once a research colony.
You split off from Earth a century ago.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.973
You're fully self-sufficient.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.351
We were.

39:14.977 --> 39:17.605
An accident at our liquid hydrocarbon
research base

39:17.688 --> 39:19.690
destroyed a third of our habitats.

39:21.025 --> 39:22.443
Wiped out our tillable soil.

39:22.526 --> 39:26.364
We've no long-range communications,
no way to ask for help.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.325
And we have lost...

39:30.159 --> 39:32.328
just too many to count.

39:33.037 --> 39:36.082
The first ship we sent for help
to our home planet...

39:37.583 --> 39:39.877
was fired upon and destroyed.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.714
Well, then we knew we were on our own.

39:44.131 --> 39:46.801
Earth has had to have
strong defense protocols

39:47.051 --> 39:48.803
in the name of self-preservation.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.430
We didn't know.

39:52.098 --> 39:53.057
Now you do.

39:55.226 --> 40:00.106
Captain Ndoye, can Earth provide engineers
and equipment to Titan?

40:01.440 --> 40:03.275
So an accident like that
doesn't happen again.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.488
And assuming
Titan's research was not lost,

40:07.571 --> 40:10.157
perhaps it could be shared
with Earth in return.

40:13.035 --> 40:14.745
I'm willing to discuss terms.

40:21.293 --> 40:22.128
As am I.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.438
The way you handled Wen was admirable.

40:41.313 --> 40:43.983
An exception can be made
for your crew to visit Earth's surface,

40:44.066 --> 40:45.109
should they wish to do so.

40:45.526 --> 40:47.695
We would appreciate that immensely.

40:48.737 --> 40:50.114
It has been a long journey.

40:51.157 --> 40:54.743
-You spoke with Adira?
-She told me she can help you.

40:54.827 --> 40:57.329
She has my permission
to remain on board your ship.

40:57.830 --> 40:59.498
[Saru] Thank you, Captain Ndoye.

41:01.041 --> 41:04.170
I would like to believe
we will return some day.

41:05.504 --> 41:07.965
We hope to offer you a warmer welcome
when you do.

41:09.258 --> 41:11.969
May your search be fruitful, Captain Saru.

41:21.770 --> 41:25.191
Commander Stamets said
you know where to find Admiral Tal.

41:25.524 --> 41:27.693
Does this mean he is alive after all?

41:28.444 --> 41:29.778
Um, sort of.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.743
I am Admiral Tal.

41:39.622 --> 41:46.128
Although human, it appears young Adira
has been joined with a Trill symbiont.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.171
[Burnham] Trill?

41:48.214 --> 41:49.924
I've seen Trills at the Exchanges.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.884
I didn't know they carried symbionts.

41:51.967 --> 41:52.885
Mm.

41:53.677 --> 41:55.346
According to the sphere data...

41:56.805 --> 42:02.978
the symbionts are a sentient life form,
benevolent, and extremely long-lived.

42:03.312 --> 42:05.397
Once they've joined with a host,

42:05.689 --> 42:10.778
that host has the ability to access
the memories of all former hosts.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.571
Including Admiral Tal's.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.156
Yes.

42:14.865 --> 42:20.913
But... it seems Adira
has difficulty accessing those memories.

42:21.288 --> 42:24.708
Perhaps because she is human
and not Trill.

42:26.835 --> 42:28.671
Now, regardless...

42:30.422 --> 42:33.842
she may carry knowledge
of what remains of Starfleet.

42:34.301 --> 42:35.135
I hope so.

42:45.020 --> 42:46.897
I should have told you about my plan.

42:48.857 --> 42:50.150
Yes, you should have.

42:52.319 --> 42:54.446
Trust must remain an assumption
between us.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.084
We have work to do...

43:09.253 --> 43:11.589
and I would be proud to do it
by your side.

43:14.883 --> 43:18.512
But there are things, in my year here...

43:22.349 --> 43:23.767
that I let go of.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.024
And I need time...

43:31.942 --> 43:33.444
to find my way back to them.

43:35.112 --> 43:36.030
If I can.

43:40.117 --> 43:43.871
I will trust you to grow through change...

43:45.247 --> 43:47.082
as you have trusted me.

43:49.335 --> 43:52.421
Then it would be my privilege
to be your Number One.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.433
If things were easy.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.604
-It wouldn't be worth it. Hmm?
-[chuckles]

44:11.106 --> 44:12.816
Are you sure you won't miss the uniform?

44:13.400 --> 44:16.570
I have a rash
from that damn uniform, okay?

44:17.154 --> 44:17.988
You owe me.

44:21.533 --> 44:24.161
You get a fresh start in a new quadrant.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.205
By my count, we're even.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.044
I'm glad you have a family here, Michael.

44:34.797 --> 44:35.631
Till next time.

44:36.548 --> 44:37.591
Till next time.

45:10.707 --> 45:15.796
-[Burnham] That's Starfleet Academy.
-Indeed, or, at least, it was.

45:16.422 --> 45:17.339
Where is everyone?

45:17.506 --> 45:21.385
I gave them leave to pay a visit.
You're welcome to join them.

45:22.094 --> 45:22.928
No.

45:26.598 --> 45:28.809
I think I'll admire the view from here...

45:31.103 --> 45:31.937
with you.

45:41.947 --> 45:44.158
Some places can survive anything.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.784
After all this time.

45:46.994 --> 45:48.996
Oh, my gosh, here it is.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.623
-I used to study under this tree.
-So did I.

45:52.166 --> 45:53.041
[Rhys] Me, too.

45:53.459 --> 45:56.378
It's so... big now!

46:00.632 --> 46:03.760
It's so weird, it's like,
all these things are gone,

46:03.844 --> 46:06.096
but here it is,
it's exactly where it's supposed to be.

46:06.597 --> 46:10.017
We all stood in the same spot,
930 years apart.

46:11.226 --> 46:12.352
Who else can say that?

46:12.936 --> 46:14.021
[comm beeps]

46:14.688 --> 46:16.648
[Saru over radio] <i>This is Captain Saru.</i>

46:16.732 --> 46:19.067
Oh, please, captain,
can we just have five more minutes?

46:19.610 --> 46:23.780
<i>We have much work to do before we continue</i>
<i>our search for Federation Headquarters.</i>

46:23.864 --> 46:26.533
<i>But you may have your five minutes.</i>

46:26.617 --> 46:27.493
<i>Enjoy.</i>
