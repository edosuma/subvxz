00:31.144 --> 00:33.311
<i>We're fighting
a war to protect Nassau</i>

00:33.313 --> 00:34.979
<i>in which our most effective weapon</i>

00:34.981 --> 00:38.066
<i>is the fear that we can
instill in our enemies.</i>

00:38.118 --> 00:40.902
Everything is dependent upon that gold,

00:40.954 --> 00:44.289
and right now it is sitting in a
fort with no guns and full of holes.

00:44.324 --> 00:46.241
You couldn't figure out
how to repair the fort,

00:46.293 --> 00:48.993
<i>so you lured me into capturing a
ship full of slaves to do the job.</i>

00:49.046 --> 00:51.329
<i>I wonder if you can help
me locate an old friend of mine.</i>

00:51.381 --> 00:53.164
His name is Charles Vane.

00:53.216 --> 00:55.250
<i>I am to set sail
for the West Indies,</i>

00:55.302 --> 00:56.668
the one element I lack

00:56.670 --> 00:58.253
<i>is someone who understands Nassau.</i>

00:58.305 --> 00:59.754
<i>If you agree to be that person,</i>

00:59.806 --> 01:01.423
<i>your sentence will be commuted</i>

01:01.475 --> 01:02.807
<i>and the charges against you released.</i>

01:02.843 --> 01:05.343
Crew of the Walrus, surrender,

01:05.345 --> 01:07.345
and I am authorized to offer you full,

01:07.347 --> 01:09.597
<i>unqualified pardons.</i>

01:09.649 --> 01:12.684
We're not fighting and
we're not surrendering,

01:12.686 --> 01:13.818
so what are we doing?

01:13.854 --> 01:15.566
We're going that way.

01:15.688 --> 01:18.569
That's a ship killer.

04:32.802 --> 04:36.554
<i>Captain.</i>

04:36.606 --> 04:38.389
He's closed the gap.

04:43.947 --> 04:46.364
All hands to quarters.

04:46.399 --> 04:49.067
<i>Come on, lads. Rouse yourselves.</i>

04:50.687 --> 04:52.487
Quickly!

04:56.612 --> 04:57.944
I've got starboard watch below,

04:57.980 --> 05:00.030
<i>caulking the gunports.</i>

05:00.065 --> 05:02.065
The pumps are keeping
up with the water-line,

05:02.117 --> 05:03.200
but given what's ahead of us,

05:03.235 --> 05:05.235
I don't imagine that'll last long.

05:11.293 --> 05:12.793
<i>Heave, lads!</i>

05:28.227 --> 05:30.010
He'll be withdrawing soon.

05:30.062 --> 05:31.061
He'll drive us into the storm,

05:31.096 --> 05:33.897
but he'll want no part of it himself.

05:33.932 --> 05:37.067
Captain, perhaps we could
take the topgallants in now.

05:37.102 --> 05:39.402
If we enter that storm under full sail,

05:39.438 --> 05:41.771
it may become impossible
to take the canvas in.

05:41.773 --> 05:44.441
If we take at least some of them now...

05:44.493 --> 05:45.826
If he sees us slow,

05:45.861 --> 05:47.777
if we show him the least sign of weakness,

05:47.779 --> 05:49.996
it'll only encourage him to
press on and finish the job.

05:52.117 --> 05:54.284
But we'll get men into the tops.

05:54.286 --> 05:57.287
Soon as he turns, we'll
shorten sail immediately.

05:57.289 --> 05:58.788
Aye, Captain.

05:58.841 --> 06:00.173
<i>I want crew aloft!</i>

06:00.209 --> 06:01.625
<i>Quick as you can!</i>

06:01.677 --> 06:05.178
Taking and stowing all that
sail will be a challenge.

06:05.214 --> 06:07.214
You'll see to leading the men in the rig

06:07.266 --> 06:10.467
when the time comes, yes?

06:10.469 --> 06:12.385
Yeah.

06:12.437 --> 06:14.020
I'll pull all hands from below.

06:14.056 --> 06:15.972
We'll need all the strength we can muster.

06:30.205 --> 06:31.905
We should have taken the pardons.

06:33.909 --> 06:35.876
Sign our name, swear to whomever

06:35.911 --> 06:37.878
or whatever the fuck one
swears to on the occasion,

06:37.913 --> 06:39.329
accept the pardons,

06:39.331 --> 06:40.997
then go straight back to the account.

06:40.999 --> 06:42.749
What the fuck could they do to us

06:42.801 --> 06:45.168
they weren't gonna do anyway?

06:45.220 --> 06:47.504
I don't imagine Hornigold's
offer still stands,

06:47.506 --> 06:49.673
if that's what you're asking.

06:49.725 --> 06:52.392
No, I don't imagine it does either,

06:52.427 --> 06:54.761
but a few hours ago
when the offer did stand,

06:54.813 --> 06:57.397
perhaps that should have
been a conversation...

06:57.432 --> 06:59.683
Accept the pardons with
full intent not to honor it

06:59.685 --> 07:02.235
rather than face what we now face.

07:02.271 --> 07:04.271
The men, I understand.

07:04.323 --> 07:06.273
Flint had them
exactly where he needed them...

07:06.325 --> 07:09.025
Angry, resentful, afraid.

07:09.077 --> 07:11.945
I understand why they would
rather do battle with that storm

07:11.997 --> 07:14.998
than even consider
surrendering to Hornigold.

07:17.202 --> 07:20.086
But he had me there too.

07:20.122 --> 07:23.540
He had me there.

07:23.542 --> 07:26.376
And that is not supposed to happen.

08:04.833 --> 08:06.249
May I help you?

08:06.301 --> 08:08.835
The governor requests your
presence on the quarterdeck.

08:08.887 --> 08:10.136
You should dress.

08:16.221 --> 08:17.260
You'll have to pardon me.

08:17.312 --> 08:19.346
I've never had a proper chambermaid before.

08:19.398 --> 08:22.232
Is that how they address
all their employers?

08:25.604 --> 08:27.404
Governor Rogers is my employer.

08:27.439 --> 08:30.190
You are a convict in need of
someone to keep your things clean,

08:30.242 --> 08:32.442
your movement restricted,
and your door shut.

08:32.494 --> 08:34.943
As such, you're the first
daughter of privilege

08:34.996 --> 08:38.198
I have been able to serve
while speaking my mind openly.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.283
I would have thought my
story is well told by now,

08:40.335 --> 08:41.501
but I come from no privilege.

08:41.535 --> 08:43.953
Don't you?

08:44.006 --> 08:46.956
My understanding is that your
father built a criminal enterprise

08:47.009 --> 08:49.676
<i>and you inherited it.</i>

08:49.711 --> 08:51.961
The only difference between you

08:52.014 --> 08:56.516
and the ladies I have
served in the past is...

08:56.551 --> 08:58.935
their families had better lawyers.

09:01.556 --> 09:03.523
Let's not keep the governor waiting.

09:06.311 --> 09:07.727
<i>The HMS Milford.</i>

09:07.779 --> 09:10.730
<i>150 soldiers, 60 guns.</i>

09:10.782 --> 09:12.449
My lead naval escort.

09:12.484 --> 09:16.453
Uh, behind her, the HMS Rose. 48 guns.

09:16.488 --> 09:19.289
The HMS Shark, 30 guns,

09:19.324 --> 09:22.125
the Willing Mind. 20 guns.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.160
She's carrying two thirds
of the farming implements

09:24.162 --> 09:25.662
and most of our foodstuffs.

09:25.714 --> 09:28.331
The Buck. 18 guns.

09:28.383 --> 09:30.383
The amount of energy it took

09:30.419 --> 09:33.002
to persuade my investors to fund this,

09:33.055 --> 09:35.889
it's hard to properly convey.

09:37.059 --> 09:40.727
This fleet, every ship at sea,

09:40.762 --> 09:43.763
every man contracted, every penny lent.

09:43.815 --> 09:47.150
I am personally answerable for all of it.

09:47.185 --> 09:49.402
I'm impressed.

09:49.438 --> 09:51.438
Though somehow I don't imagine

09:51.490 --> 09:53.990
that that's what this exercise
is intended to accomplish.

09:55.994 --> 09:57.494
The Gloucestershire.

09:57.529 --> 09:59.662
<i>I wasn't entirely sure I needed her,</i>

09:59.698 --> 10:01.531
<i>but seeing as it was someone else's money,</i>

10:01.583 --> 10:03.833
I figured it couldn't hurt.

10:03.869 --> 10:07.420
She's the one I can do without.

10:07.456 --> 10:12.292
The moment I believe you are no
longer necessary to this endeavor,

10:12.344 --> 10:14.127
you go on that ship,

10:14.179 --> 10:16.296
that ship turns back for London,

10:16.348 --> 10:19.516
and soon thereafter,
you swing over Wapping.

10:19.551 --> 10:22.719
Except that you can't actually
do any of those things.

10:22.771 --> 10:25.522
No? Why?

10:25.557 --> 10:29.692
'Cause you don't know that Samuel
Wayne has never once paid for a drink.

10:29.693 --> 10:31.478
Because you don't know
that the Boyd brothers

10:31.479 --> 10:32.529
can't be in the presence of anyone

10:32.564 --> 10:34.364
from Captain Moulton's crew.

10:34.399 --> 10:36.232
'Cause you don't know which
of the street merchants

10:36.234 --> 10:38.618
is in the pocket of the brothel madam.

10:38.653 --> 10:41.704
You don't know. You don't know...

10:41.740 --> 10:43.907
you don't know.

10:43.909 --> 10:46.493
But I do.

10:46.545 --> 10:49.045
To slay Nassau, you must know her.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.498
And amidst all those ships

10:51.550 --> 10:53.883
and all these men and all that money,

10:53.919 --> 10:56.336
I am the only one who can introduce you.

10:56.388 --> 10:59.339
Provided you tell me the truth.

11:01.510 --> 11:05.595
So let us assume those are
now the rules of the game.

11:05.597 --> 11:09.599
I need to know everything
you know of Nassau.

11:09.601 --> 11:11.651
If you withhold, if you manipulate,

11:11.686 --> 11:14.938
if you lie... you die.

11:18.276 --> 11:20.610
Shall we begin?

11:24.166 --> 11:27.000
- 500 pieces.
- Yes.

11:29.504 --> 11:34.290
You want to withdraw 500
pieces of eight from your share.

11:34.292 --> 11:35.708
That's correct.

11:35.760 --> 11:38.761
You were just here two days ago.

11:38.797 --> 11:40.547
Yes.

11:40.599 --> 11:43.933
<i>To withdraw 500 pieces. It
was dispersed, was it not?</i>

11:43.969 --> 11:45.051
Yes.

11:45.103 --> 11:47.270
- But you're back for more.
- Yes.

11:47.305 --> 11:51.691
What in God's name did you spend
500 pieces on in two days' time?

11:51.726 --> 11:54.143
Oh, I lost it.

11:54.145 --> 11:57.146
Lost it? As in through a wager?

11:57.199 --> 12:01.957
No. "Lost it" as in I had it in a sack

12:01.958 --> 12:03.536
and I put it down,

12:03.537 --> 12:04.572
and when I came back to pick it up,

12:04.573 --> 12:06.823
it weren't where I put it.

12:06.825 --> 12:08.602
Lost.

12:14.666 --> 12:17.011
- Would you like me to...
- Thank you.

12:19.873 --> 12:22.758
<i>The crew has
entrusted the captain and I</i>

12:22.793 --> 12:25.877
to watch over the prize
gold and to protect it

12:25.929 --> 12:28.213
in all our interests, yeah?

12:28.215 --> 12:32.634
Now, as your quartermaster
and as your friend,

12:32.686 --> 12:34.636
I feel duty bound to suggest

12:34.688 --> 12:37.606
that you reconsider
withdrawing sums this large

12:37.641 --> 12:39.608
<i>without a better plan for keeping it</i>

12:39.643 --> 12:41.860
<i>once it's withdrawn, yeah?</i>

12:41.895 --> 12:43.562
Yes.

12:43.564 --> 12:45.230
Good.

12:45.232 --> 12:48.366
Now, is there a lesser amount

12:48.402 --> 12:52.154
you might want to begin with for today?

12:52.206 --> 12:53.989
Well, 500 pieces.

12:54.041 --> 12:55.574
500 pieces. Why not?

12:55.576 --> 12:57.242
- I need a new sack as well.
- Obviously.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.211
Yeah.

12:59.246 --> 13:01.079
Yes?

13:05.219 --> 13:06.668
Mr. Featherstone,

13:06.720 --> 13:09.421
<i>may we have the room
for a moment, please?</i>

13:24.238 --> 13:26.988
These are identical.

13:27.024 --> 13:29.107
350 pieces on both sides,

13:29.159 --> 13:32.410
yet one I can fit in the palm of my hand,

13:32.446 --> 13:34.579
and the other is currently occupying

13:34.615 --> 13:37.582
the entirety of the
vault beneath your fort.

13:37.618 --> 13:40.368
Which of the two would you
rather have in your possession

13:40.420 --> 13:42.587
the day Spain or England arrives

13:42.623 --> 13:45.707
and sets its eyes on conquering that fort?

13:45.759 --> 13:50.095
Yeah. I have that.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.964
So I suppose what we ought to do

13:52.966 --> 13:55.600
is ensure that the fort is not conquerable,

13:55.601 --> 13:56.636
which, as good fortune would have it,

13:56.637 --> 13:58.436
is what I'm doing.

13:58.472 --> 14:00.305
You cannot truly believe that is possible.

14:00.357 --> 14:02.641
<i>You know as well as I do</i>

14:02.643 --> 14:04.276
that so long as that gold is sitting

14:04.311 --> 14:05.777
in the belly of that fort,

14:05.812 --> 14:07.445
we are doubly exposed.

14:07.481 --> 14:10.649
Losing the fort guarantees
the loss of the gold.

14:10.701 --> 14:13.201
Excuse me. What are you suggesting?

14:13.237 --> 14:15.654
That we exchange it.

14:15.706 --> 14:18.573
As much of it as possible.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.825
Find partners and trade coin

14:20.827 --> 14:23.828
<i>for commodities far easier
to move and to protect.</i>

14:23.830 --> 14:26.748
If Nassau falls, we will
have something to set aside

14:26.800 --> 14:28.500
to ensure our futures.

14:28.552 --> 14:31.469
"Our"? Who?

14:31.505 --> 14:34.256
Mine. And Anne's.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.759
Lovely. Good old Jack gets
buried beneath a pile of rubble

14:37.811 --> 14:40.511
while you two begin a
well-funded life of leisure.

14:40.512 --> 14:41.514
I didn't say that.

14:41.515 --> 14:43.315
It's bad enough the only
time I get to see her

14:43.350 --> 14:45.850
is when she comes here to relay
something that you're displeased with.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.186
Now we're just accepting
that if forced to choose

14:48.238 --> 14:52.324
between a long future with
you and a short one with me...

14:52.359 --> 14:55.860
there's no chance she'll
even consider the latter.

14:55.913 --> 14:58.196
Of course she will choose you.

15:02.836 --> 15:06.922
The fort is going to fall.

15:06.957 --> 15:11.259
Tomorrow. Next week. Someday.

15:11.295 --> 15:13.378
And I do not believe for a moment

15:13.380 --> 15:14.546
that you are stupid enough

15:14.548 --> 15:16.848
to let yourself be buried beneath it

15:16.849 --> 15:17.882
when it does.

15:17.884 --> 15:22.721
It will pain her to leave me behind...

15:22.773 --> 15:25.807
What we have shared these past few months,

15:25.859 --> 15:30.228
it will be very hard.

15:30.280 --> 15:33.281
But you...

15:33.317 --> 15:36.735
without you, there is no her.

15:40.490 --> 15:43.241
I am here in part to secure my own future.

15:43.293 --> 15:45.460
I will not apologize for that.

15:45.495 --> 15:48.797
But that is not why I'm asking
you to cooperate with me.

15:48.832 --> 15:52.751
I am asking because though I
know we have our differences,

15:52.753 --> 15:55.220
I know there is one thing we share.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.925
We both love her.

16:04.931 --> 16:08.099
Let us make sure her
future at least is secure.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.876
<i>Heave!</i>

16:46.056 --> 16:48.556
Stand ready!

18:02.048 --> 18:05.550
Ah!

18:05.602 --> 18:06.634
You don't need to be doing this.

18:06.686 --> 18:08.386
I can finish it.

18:08.438 --> 18:10.722
I'm useless to 'em up top.

18:10.774 --> 18:12.690
Gotta do my part somehow.

18:12.726 --> 18:14.726
<i>You shouldn't talk that way, you know.</i>

18:14.778 --> 18:17.612
We got our share of
useless fucks on this crew.

18:17.647 --> 18:20.732
You ain't one.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.951
This is the second time
in the last few months

18:22.986 --> 18:25.320
I'm facing certain death.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.872
And you are again offering moral support.

18:27.908 --> 18:29.407
Does that mean we're married?

18:39.803 --> 18:42.086
Don't.

18:42.139 --> 18:43.922
Fuckin' hell.

18:43.924 --> 18:46.391
What part of "let us take care
of you" did you not understand?

18:48.061 --> 18:49.252
If it wasn't for you,

18:49.253 --> 18:51.429
we'd all be planted at the
bottom of the Charles Town bay.

18:51.481 --> 18:53.982
We got a debt for that.

18:54.017 --> 18:57.519
It ain't right not to let us pay it.

18:57.571 --> 19:00.155
All the shit we been
through the last few months,

19:00.190 --> 19:01.940
do you wanna know what
the most terrifying part

19:01.992 --> 19:03.658
of all of it's been?

19:03.693 --> 19:07.529
"We'll take care of you."

19:10.033 --> 19:11.499
I get it.

19:11.535 --> 19:13.368
Do you?

19:13.420 --> 19:15.954
'Course I do. Look at me.

19:16.006 --> 19:17.956
I know what it's like to be afraid

19:17.958 --> 19:21.593
of being the one ain't
strong enough to stick.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.262
But it don't work that way, yeah?

19:24.297 --> 19:26.381
And even if it did,

19:26.433 --> 19:28.766
it wouldn't work like that for you.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.370
Captain!

19:49.406 --> 19:51.823
<i>We're standing by!</i>

19:51.875 --> 19:53.741
<i>The rig won't hold!</i>

19:53.793 --> 19:56.461
We must break the sails
before we lose the mast!

20:02.802 --> 20:05.753
Take down the course
and the topgallants now!

20:05.805 --> 20:08.423
Now!

20:08.475 --> 20:10.592
Now! Now!

20:21.571 --> 20:25.585
Billy! Get those topgallants up!

20:26.943 --> 20:29.861
Rogelio, is the halyard running free?!

20:29.913 --> 20:31.913
It's stuck!

20:31.948 --> 20:35.917
It's bound up by the
mast! It's not coming down!

20:53.407 --> 20:56.606
At first, when my father
left, I only watched.

20:56.739 --> 20:59.192
My guardian, a slave
belonging to my father,

20:59.244 --> 21:01.410
ran the operation in his stead.

21:01.446 --> 21:03.579
Eventually, I felt it
was time I stepped in.

21:03.615 --> 21:05.665
How old were you at this point?

21:05.700 --> 21:09.118
I was 17.

21:09.170 --> 21:10.620
How does one persuade an island

21:10.672 --> 21:11.704
full of thieves and murderers

21:11.756 --> 21:13.873
to respect the authority
of a 17-year-old girl?

21:13.925 --> 21:17.426
I identified the one
they were most afraid of

21:17.462 --> 21:20.630
and I threw him off the island.

21:20.682 --> 21:23.099
What was his name?

21:23.134 --> 21:25.635
His name was Edward Teach.

21:28.940 --> 21:30.306
You're getting all of this, yes?

21:33.510 --> 21:34.644
Um...

21:34.696 --> 21:37.146
please. Continue.

21:37.198 --> 21:39.866
He sailed at the head of a pirate fleet

21:39.901 --> 21:41.617
with a man named Benjamin Hornigold.

21:41.653 --> 21:43.402
<i>I conspired with Hornigold,</i>

21:43.454 --> 21:45.571
<i>offered him control of Fort Nassau</i>

21:45.623 --> 21:46.873
<i>to turn against Teach.</i>

21:46.908 --> 21:50.493
Eventually, I isolated him
from all of his former allies

21:50.495 --> 21:52.712
until it was just him and his protégé,

21:52.747 --> 21:55.748
a young captain he had
groomed in his image,

21:55.800 --> 21:58.483
trained as a peerless fighter.

21:59.193 --> 22:01.504
Had they stayed together,
they might have resisted me.

22:01.556 --> 22:03.723
But the protégé turned?

22:03.758 --> 22:07.560
Yes. And once he'd sided with me,

22:07.595 --> 22:10.646
Teach had no choice but to withdraw.

22:10.682 --> 22:12.982
After that, my credibility
with crews on the beach

22:13.017 --> 22:14.850
was in good order.

22:14.852 --> 22:16.686
And the protégé, what was his name?

22:18.189 --> 22:20.406
His name was Charles Vane.

22:23.361 --> 22:25.027
Leave us, please.

22:26.531 --> 22:29.081
Now.

22:40.295 --> 22:44.880
I need very specific answers
to the following questions.

22:44.882 --> 22:47.300
Ask me what you want to ask me.

22:47.352 --> 22:50.303
Charles Vane sided with you?

22:50.355 --> 22:51.520
Yes.

22:51.889 --> 22:53.356
Betrayed his mentor,

22:53.391 --> 22:56.609
betrayed Edward Teach for you?

22:56.644 --> 22:57.810
Yes.

23:00.198 --> 23:01.364
You were...

23:01.399 --> 23:03.649
I was fucking him.

23:07.872 --> 23:09.205
Where are you going?

23:09.240 --> 23:11.157
To inform the captain
of the Gloucestershire

23:11.158 --> 23:12.209
he's about to head home.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.576
Plus one passenger.

23:13.578 --> 23:14.827
You never asked me.

23:14.879 --> 23:17.079
- I needed to ask?
- I never lied.

23:17.081 --> 23:20.383
I was fully prepared to set foot
on that island and say his name,

23:20.418 --> 23:22.134
say that the universal pardon

23:22.170 --> 23:25.638
had an exception, put
my credibility at risk

23:25.673 --> 23:27.473
based solely on your counsel,

23:27.508 --> 23:30.593
and it was all to settle a personal feud

23:30.595 --> 23:34.597
with a former lover?

23:34.599 --> 23:35.848
Why did you bring me here?

23:35.900 --> 23:37.900
You know these men's names,

23:37.935 --> 23:39.735
you know the things they have done.

23:39.771 --> 23:42.405
But I know them.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.074
I know Flint is dangerous,

23:45.109 --> 23:47.076
but he can be reasoned with.

23:47.111 --> 23:48.861
I know Rackham is devious,

23:48.913 --> 23:50.613
but all he cares about is his legacy.

23:50.615 --> 23:53.366
And because I have
history with Charles Vane,

23:53.418 --> 23:55.117
I know him most of all.

23:55.119 --> 23:57.953
I'm all too aware what he
is capable of destroying

23:57.955 --> 24:01.874
when he sets his mind on it.

24:01.926 --> 24:04.246
I underestimated him and I lost my father.

24:05.430 --> 24:07.463
The Lord Governor Ashe underestimated him,

24:07.465 --> 24:08.465
and Charles Town burned.

24:08.560 --> 24:10.966
What is it you would like
to have him take from you?

24:15.306 --> 24:18.607
Why, in God's name, would I trust you?

24:21.979 --> 24:25.698
Nassau is my father's house.

24:27.485 --> 24:29.318
It is my birthright, and I am obligated

24:29.370 --> 24:33.072
to see it set right, to
see its monsters driven out.

24:33.124 --> 24:36.242
You don't have to trust me

24:36.294 --> 24:39.161
because we have mutual self-interest.

24:42.333 --> 24:45.000
And that makes for better partners.

25:03.738 --> 25:05.071
<i>Captain.</i>

25:07.075 --> 25:08.441
I understand why you are here,

25:08.493 --> 25:11.193
and I understand why this troubles you.

25:12.914 --> 25:14.830
But they do not understand.

25:18.419 --> 25:21.253
In the interest of getting this
done as quickly as possible,

25:21.289 --> 25:22.254
perhaps it would be better

25:22.290 --> 25:25.291
if all our roles were more clearly defined.

25:26.377 --> 25:30.129
To avoid unnecessary and
uncomfortable confusion.

26:22.066 --> 26:24.567
A man puts a
dead thing in the ground,

26:24.602 --> 26:27.937
he expects it to stay there.

26:27.939 --> 26:31.774
<i>Sometimes it comes back.</i>

26:49.460 --> 26:51.260
I harbored such resentment

26:51.295 --> 26:52.595
in that moment all those years ago

26:52.630 --> 26:54.930
when you turned your back on me...

26:54.966 --> 26:57.299
though I sailed countless leagues with you,

26:57.351 --> 26:59.468
fought countless battles with you,

26:59.470 --> 27:01.353
taught countless lessons to you...

27:03.474 --> 27:07.276
and you did it all for a girl.

27:22.460 --> 27:25.044
Good to see you, old friend.

27:31.469 --> 27:34.970
For years, I've laid my head down at night,

27:35.006 --> 27:36.338
and no matter where I was,

27:36.340 --> 27:39.558
there was an odor would
arrive at my nose...

27:39.594 --> 27:42.845
Brine and hides and pitch and shit.

27:42.847 --> 27:45.180
The perfume of this place.

27:45.182 --> 27:49.902
Across eight years and as many wives and...

27:49.937 --> 27:52.321
so many distractions.

27:52.356 --> 27:55.357
Oh, then I meet wife number nine.

27:55.359 --> 28:00.269
And to my surprise, I
stop thinking about Nassau.

28:00.414 --> 28:02.948
The smell goes away.

28:04.418 --> 28:08.370
For almost three weeks.

28:10.041 --> 28:13.375
And then news comes across my door

28:13.427 --> 28:15.544
that there are no more Guthries in Nassau.

28:15.596 --> 28:19.214
One dead, the other in chains.

28:19.267 --> 28:24.186
It seemed a sign it was time I returned.

28:24.221 --> 28:26.805
They're both dead.

28:26.857 --> 28:29.608
Really?

28:29.644 --> 28:32.111
I heard that the spectacle
of Eleanor Guthrie's trial

28:32.146 --> 28:34.396
could go on for months.

28:34.398 --> 28:37.650
They are both dead.

28:37.702 --> 28:39.618
Mm.

28:43.887 --> 28:46.792
What happened between she and I,

28:46.827 --> 28:49.578
our role in forcing you out of this place,

28:49.630 --> 28:52.581
it's in the past.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.882
So if you returned

28:53.918 --> 28:55.884
looking to gloat about how it turned out

28:55.920 --> 28:58.587
or looking for some
sort of apology from me,

28:58.589 --> 29:00.506
<i>then you can go fuck yourself.</i>

29:00.558 --> 29:01.974
Forced me out?

29:02.009 --> 29:04.510
Is that the story you've been
telling yourself all this time?

29:04.562 --> 29:06.178
That's how I remember it.

29:06.230 --> 29:08.764
All I remember... A
young man's poor judgment

29:08.766 --> 29:10.349
which forced me to
choose between killing him

29:10.401 --> 29:12.184
and walking away and letting him live.

29:12.236 --> 29:14.403
Not quite the same thing.

29:14.438 --> 29:16.071
If you think I've been sitting around,

29:16.107 --> 29:18.107
waiting for an apology all this time,

29:18.109 --> 29:19.775
I don't know what to tell you.

29:19.777 --> 29:21.860
Then why are you here?

29:23.812 --> 29:26.699
Whose is that?

29:26.751 --> 29:27.833
<i>What?</i>

29:27.868 --> 29:30.035
Man-of-war out there.

29:30.087 --> 29:32.287
I assume that's the ship Flint
used to sack Charles Town.

29:32.340 --> 29:33.372
It's here and he isn't.

29:33.424 --> 29:34.957
I'm just asking whose it is.

29:35.009 --> 29:36.675
Ours.

29:38.129 --> 29:40.235
So don't get any fuckin' ideas.

29:44.101 --> 29:45.551
Who's "ours"?

29:45.603 --> 29:47.186
I have partners.

29:47.221 --> 29:49.805
In a compact toward the
common defense of this place.

29:49.807 --> 29:52.307
Provide a stipend to
the crews on the beach,

29:52.309 --> 29:55.027
in exchange for their agreement
to follow our lead in battle,

29:55.062 --> 29:57.563
should the need arise to defend the island.

29:57.615 --> 29:59.314
Mm.

30:04.175 --> 30:08.157
Smells differently than I remember.

30:08.209 --> 30:09.658
Maybe it's changed,

30:09.710 --> 30:11.910
or maybe I've just been
misremembering it all this time.

30:13.381 --> 30:14.546
Let's go.

30:14.582 --> 30:16.715
Where?

30:16.751 --> 30:18.851
I'd like to meet these partners of yours.

30:25.593 --> 30:27.726
Get up there! Slack off the truss lashing!

30:27.762 --> 30:29.395
Get it moving!

30:29.430 --> 30:31.513
Cut it loose if you have to!

31:21.615 --> 31:24.566
Keep her steady!

31:24.568 --> 31:25.951
<i>Hold fast, men.</i>

31:32.960 --> 31:35.577
Knockdown!

31:47.758 --> 31:50.476
Whoa!

31:55.599 --> 31:56.732
Bub!

32:18.789 --> 32:22.124
Captain! Captain!

32:22.126 --> 32:24.376
<i>With that topgallant loose,</i>

32:24.428 --> 32:26.461
<i>it'll drive us into the sea!</i>

32:26.463 --> 32:29.932
We must reduce the windage, or we'll sink.

32:32.269 --> 32:34.937
Give me another block!
Give me another block!

32:38.025 --> 32:40.392
Look out!

32:40.444 --> 32:42.060
Gah!

32:42.112 --> 32:44.780
Aah! Aah!

32:44.815 --> 32:46.448
Oh, my fucking leg!

32:49.242 --> 32:50.369
Pull 'em out!

32:50.404 --> 32:51.703
Get out!

32:53.624 --> 32:56.625
Come on. Here, here, take my hand.

33:48.045 --> 33:51.024
Help! Help!

34:09.733 --> 34:12.734
Hey! Help!

34:12.735 --> 34:14.485
Help!

34:14.538 --> 34:17.489
<i>Help! Help!</i>

35:50.667 --> 35:53.719
Help! God...!

35:57.591 --> 35:59.641
They say the worst of it don't last long.

36:07.184 --> 36:10.685
What the water does to
you once it's got you.

36:12.906 --> 36:17.192
It makes you cold, makes you scared.

36:17.244 --> 36:20.245
It shows you things. Bad things.

36:22.416 --> 36:25.033
But then it warms you.

36:25.085 --> 36:27.169
It settles you.

36:27.204 --> 36:29.788
It shows you
the places you've been.

36:33.961 --> 36:36.211
Like the people you've loved.

36:39.266 --> 36:40.766
They're all there waiting for you.

36:44.888 --> 36:48.890
It doesn't sound so bad.

36:48.892 --> 36:50.642
Fuck.

36:50.694 --> 36:51.893
Come on.

37:02.739 --> 37:04.739
Fuck...

37:09.420 --> 37:10.745
Oh, fuck.

37:10.747 --> 37:13.165
Hey! Wait!

37:13.217 --> 37:15.884
Take my... God... God, come on!

37:22.309 --> 37:23.925
<i>Come on, come on, please!</i>

37:26.063 --> 37:28.980
Ah, God!

37:30.100 --> 37:33.518
No.

37:38.826 --> 37:40.942
Fuck!

37:40.944 --> 37:43.612
Aah!

37:52.956 --> 37:54.589
Fuck!

37:58.545 --> 38:00.795
Fuck! Fuck!

38:21.902 --> 38:25.120
Found that. At the inn by the bar.

38:25.155 --> 38:27.706
Oh, I know. Mr. Warren
misplaced it yesterday.

38:27.741 --> 38:30.542
No, that one we found
in the privy yesterday.

38:30.577 --> 38:33.211
This is the new one he was dispersed today.

38:34.831 --> 38:36.915
Are you certain?

38:42.516 --> 38:45.134
Just how fucking stupid,
exactly, are your men?

38:48.105 --> 38:50.022
It's hard to say.

39:03.320 --> 39:08.040
Ah, to a momentous return.

39:08.659 --> 39:11.960
A man of your ability and experience

39:11.996 --> 39:14.079
will be a most welcome addition

39:14.131 --> 39:16.498
to our ranks.

39:16.550 --> 39:18.967
Jack.

39:19.003 --> 39:20.669
Rackham.

39:22.673 --> 39:24.256
That's my name.

39:24.308 --> 39:25.641
You were the scrawny one...

39:25.676 --> 39:27.643
who was trying so desperately

39:27.678 --> 39:29.511
to join Charles' first crew.

39:29.563 --> 39:32.398
Flint I can understand,

39:32.433 --> 39:35.067
but this is your third partner?

39:35.102 --> 39:37.519
<i>Jack took the Urca de Lima prize.</i>

39:37.571 --> 39:39.571
Transported it, secured it.

39:39.607 --> 39:41.990
He's been employing it to
provide for Nassau's defense.

39:42.026 --> 39:44.410
Nassau, as I'm sure you recall,

39:44.445 --> 39:47.196
lacks the will to form an identity.

39:47.248 --> 39:48.363
It is and always has been

39:48.365 --> 39:49.581
fragments of an idea,

39:49.617 --> 39:50.999
and without identity...

39:51.035 --> 39:52.297
An organized defense?

39:52.432 --> 39:53.419
Near impossible.

39:53.454 --> 39:57.039
The stipends...

39:57.091 --> 39:59.708
create an obligation to follow one command

39:59.760 --> 40:01.844
in the event of a threat to the island.

40:01.879 --> 40:05.180
Captain Flint, as the island's
most able naval tactician,

40:05.216 --> 40:06.765
would command our forces on the water,

40:06.801 --> 40:10.302
and Charles would captain the
militia to defend the land.

40:10.354 --> 40:12.888
Why?

40:12.890 --> 40:15.057
Beg your pardon?

40:15.109 --> 40:18.610
Why are you so determined to defend Nassau?

40:20.731 --> 40:22.898
Because Henry Avery set his camp here

40:22.950 --> 40:24.733
and said, "This is a place for free men."

40:24.785 --> 40:28.120
<i>And because you sailed from
here and made this place feared.</i>

40:28.155 --> 40:30.956
<i>Because Henry Jennings
and Benjamin Hornigold</i>

40:30.991 --> 40:33.375
<i>and Sam Bellamy gave Nassau life.</i>

40:33.410 --> 40:35.294
And you think your name
belongs on that list.

40:35.329 --> 40:38.247
Yes, I understand.

40:38.249 --> 40:40.582
<i>Captain Teach?</i>

40:48.259 --> 40:51.093
We hear you're taking on new men.

40:51.145 --> 40:52.561
We'd like to join you.

40:57.685 --> 40:59.601
If you please.

41:03.908 --> 41:05.941
When I was a young man in this place,

41:05.993 --> 41:09.328
it was a settled notion that in
order to join a crew of any repute,

41:09.363 --> 41:12.281
one had to prove his worth.

41:12.333 --> 41:15.784
<i>Two men, evenly matched, bare fists,</i>

41:15.786 --> 41:17.619
the only measure of difference between them

41:17.671 --> 41:20.289
being the measure of their will.

41:20.291 --> 41:24.543
Now all a man need do is say "please."

41:28.465 --> 41:31.717
You want us to fight each other for this?

41:43.280 --> 41:44.730
I had such hopes for this place

41:44.782 --> 41:46.315
when I heard the Guthries had gone.

41:46.367 --> 41:48.817
<i>Thought it had a chance to
return to what it once was,</i>

41:48.819 --> 41:50.652
<i>return to that state.</i>

41:50.654 --> 41:53.322
But now I see there's
no hope of that anymore.

41:53.374 --> 41:55.407
You have taken away

41:55.459 --> 41:57.459
the one thing that made Nassau what it was.

41:57.494 --> 42:01.163
You have given her prosperity.

42:01.165 --> 42:04.666
Strife is good.

42:04.718 --> 42:08.170
Strife makes a man strong.

42:08.222 --> 42:11.256
For if a man is capable
of confronting death daily,

42:11.308 --> 42:12.724
functioning in the face of it,

42:12.760 --> 42:14.393
there's no telling what
else that man can do,

42:14.428 --> 42:16.178
<i>and a man whose limits cannot be known</i>

42:16.180 --> 42:18.847
<i>is a very hard man to defeat in battle.</i>

42:18.849 --> 42:22.651
Now I look around me and
I see crews filled with men

42:22.686 --> 42:25.654
who've only ever won a
prize through surrender.

42:25.689 --> 42:29.658
I see captains who ought to
have been deposed months ago

42:29.693 --> 42:32.361
keep their office because
their men are comfortable.

42:32.363 --> 42:35.697
<i>I see decay everywhere.</i>

42:35.699 --> 42:39.618
<i>Now, I returned to go on
the account as I know it.</i>

42:39.670 --> 42:42.537
I returned because in this place

42:42.590 --> 42:45.757
I believed I could find
the men necessary to do so

42:45.793 --> 42:49.127
and, in particular, one
man that I thought worthy

42:49.179 --> 42:52.848
<i>of standing alongside me at
the head of a terrible fleet.</i>

42:55.636 --> 42:58.136
I wonder if he's still here.

43:52.374 --> 43:53.692
Now, listen.

43:53.744 --> 43:56.278
I am committed to defending the gold,

43:56.330 --> 43:58.497
the fort, this place,

43:58.532 --> 44:00.282
to preserving it for an age.

44:00.334 --> 44:01.583
I owe that to my partners.

44:01.618 --> 44:02.584
I owe it to myself.

44:02.619 --> 44:04.920
I cannot imagine failure.

44:04.955 --> 44:07.956
But I cannot deny the
potential for it either.

44:10.678 --> 44:12.044
<i>You will organize the exchanges...</i>

44:12.096 --> 44:13.795
Gold for things of equal value,

44:13.847 --> 44:15.013
yet small and light.

44:15.049 --> 44:16.348
Mr. Featherstone and I

44:16.383 --> 44:17.883
will facilitate moving the gold

44:17.935 --> 44:21.303
from the treasury in secret
to the site of each location.

44:21.305 --> 44:22.938
You will keep it quiet.

44:22.973 --> 44:26.475
Only as many men as it takes
to secure the transactions.

44:26.527 --> 44:27.976
<i>I don't like how any of this looks,</i>

44:27.978 --> 44:30.729
our scurrying about, stashing
things away in dark places

44:30.781 --> 44:32.731
like fucking rodents
preparing for the winter.

44:32.783 --> 44:33.982
And most critically,

44:34.034 --> 44:35.650
I do not want my partners,

44:35.703 --> 44:38.787
Captains Flint or Vane, to hear about it.

44:38.822 --> 44:41.156
If either of them catches wind of this,

44:41.158 --> 44:42.874
shit, I don't know.

44:42.910 --> 44:45.127
Just keep your mouth shut about it.

44:55.222 --> 44:58.557
What did you say to him?

44:58.592 --> 44:59.758
Tell me the truth.

44:59.810 --> 45:01.727
What did you say to
make him change his mind?

45:06.016 --> 45:08.984
You and I spoke of what will likely happen

45:09.019 --> 45:11.987
the day England returns to this place.

45:12.022 --> 45:13.989
We spoke of how I must stay.

45:14.024 --> 45:17.492
Must find a way to enter into their world,

45:17.528 --> 45:20.495
and I believe you would
want to enter it with me.

45:20.531 --> 45:22.197
I believe that in this moment

45:22.249 --> 45:24.366
you cannot fathom leaving me.

45:26.942 --> 45:29.504
But if we are honest with each other,

45:29.540 --> 45:30.956
I think we both know...

45:31.008 --> 45:32.207
Stop.

45:32.209 --> 45:35.010
Sooner or later, the day is going to come

45:35.045 --> 45:36.962
when, no matter our feelings,

45:37.014 --> 45:39.681
the world will demand that you and I...

46:06.303 --> 46:08.269
We'll be heading into the wind!

46:08.305 --> 46:12.223
<i>Things'll get rougher!</i>

46:12.275 --> 46:13.775
Captain!

46:13.810 --> 46:15.527
There's nothing more to be done.

46:15.562 --> 46:17.896
We should heave to, ride it out below.

46:17.948 --> 46:20.281
Hornigold knows our last position.

46:20.317 --> 46:22.617
They'll be patrolling downwind.

46:22.652 --> 46:25.537
The storm'll blow us right to him.

46:25.572 --> 46:29.824
Head up now... Close as you can.

46:29.876 --> 46:32.961
Captain, this is mad!

46:32.996 --> 46:36.331
Billy, make it so.

46:38.969 --> 46:42.170
You two, man the starboard braces.

46:46.810 --> 46:48.593
<i>You heard, man the braces!</i>

47:36.810 --> 47:38.726
Hold it. Hold it.

47:51.014 --> 47:52.151
<i>Got to close the hatch.</i>

47:52.203 --> 47:53.736
Close the hatch!

47:56.291 --> 47:58.240
Where's the captain?

48:57.301 --> 49:00.469
Not that I anticipate it will
alter your behavior in any way,

49:00.521 --> 49:04.273
but you should know I
do not approve of this.

49:04.308 --> 49:08.194
I know what I'm doing.

49:08.229 --> 49:10.980
<i>Like most of London, I read your memoir.</i>

49:10.982 --> 49:14.567
Marveled at your privateering exploits.

49:14.619 --> 49:15.651
It was quite a story.

49:15.703 --> 49:19.155
But I hear things.

49:19.207 --> 49:22.992
Certain details of your grand voyage,

49:22.994 --> 49:25.211
rash decisions and the
terrible injuries that followed,

49:25.246 --> 49:28.214
the scars of which are...

49:28.249 --> 49:30.716
left out of the pages of your account.

49:32.387 --> 49:34.898
But perhaps harder to erase elsewhere.

49:39.427 --> 49:43.062
Were you so confident then as you are now?

49:47.318 --> 49:50.319
Captain Hornigold. Welcome aboard.

49:51.572 --> 49:54.106
Mr. Dufresne.

49:54.158 --> 49:55.357
I have news to relay, sir,

49:55.359 --> 49:57.109
but first, I'm sorry,

49:57.161 --> 50:00.279
I must address a rumor I've
heard since my arrival here,

50:00.331 --> 50:03.749
a rumor most troubling about a fugitive

50:03.785 --> 50:07.036
that you've made a part of your endeavor.

50:13.377 --> 50:14.710
Jesus.

50:14.712 --> 50:15.761
I would introduce you,

50:15.797 --> 50:17.046
but, uh, from what I understand,

50:17.098 --> 50:18.714
you're quite familiar with one another.

50:18.766 --> 50:21.050
Respectfully, that woman
is not to be trusted.

50:21.102 --> 50:22.384
I know,

50:22.386 --> 50:25.387
but perhaps I don't need to trust her.

50:25.440 --> 50:27.306
And, by way of context,

50:27.358 --> 50:30.443
I don't much trust you either.

50:30.478 --> 50:33.229
<i>Let's assume you'll each
be a check on the other,</i>

50:33.281 --> 50:35.564
and I'll count myself fortunate.

50:35.616 --> 50:37.900
What news, Captain?

50:37.902 --> 50:41.454
I engaged Captain Flint as promised.

50:41.489 --> 50:45.124
When he and his crew
declined my offer of pardons,

50:45.159 --> 50:47.293
I pressed my advantage and drove him,

50:47.328 --> 50:49.545
already battered, into a tempest.

50:49.580 --> 50:52.414
<i>When it subsided, I patrolled
the area extensively</i>

50:52.467 --> 50:55.417
and recovered several
pieces of fresh debris.

50:55.470 --> 50:57.419
Debris? What kind of debris?

50:57.472 --> 50:59.805
The definitive kind.

51:03.511 --> 51:06.428
Captain Flint is dead.

52:51.519 --> 52:53.302
We're not moving.

53:24.885 --> 53:27.553
Where are we?

53:27.588 --> 53:29.388
The storm drove us east

53:29.423 --> 53:31.473
into the Sargasso Sea.

53:31.509 --> 53:33.809
We are becalmed.

53:33.844 --> 53:35.010
Stores?

53:35.062 --> 53:36.011
Most of the fresh water

53:36.063 --> 53:38.514
was lost in the flooding in the storm.

53:38.566 --> 53:40.182
The food that could be salvaged,

53:40.234 --> 53:42.267
we have a few days.

53:42.320 --> 53:43.485
Maybe a week.

53:45.272 --> 53:46.939
How far to the nearest coast?

53:49.493 --> 53:51.777
At our current speed?

53:51.829 --> 53:54.131
About three times that.

53:55.583 --> 53:57.798
Unless the wind returns soon...

53:59.587 --> 54:01.771
we won't survive this.
