The only way that

{\an1}You don't have to marry
that spineless creature Cliff.

Athenia?

{\an1}The Spartanians were trying
to abuse their privilege,

00:39.414 --> 00:41.416
making that a part of
being granted refuge.

00:41.499 --> 00:45.128
{\an1}But your father and I would
never force you to marry anyone.

his whiny son packing.

change his mind.

01:04.438 --> 01:07.150

08:03.274 --> 08:04.567
Oooh, Devon, don't you
have Channel Five

08:04.650 --> 08:06.861
Meteorologist Chuck
Hanson's home address?

08:06.944 --> 08:08.029
Yes.

08:08.112 --> 08:10.114
But I'm no longer allowed
to go within 50 feet of him.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.240
It's a long story.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.576
I just, think he's
the greatest.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.455
They were right: number
seven totally blew my mind!

08:17.538 --> 08:18.581
A viral video.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.083
Those things just
kind of happen.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.877
You can't force
something to go viral.

08:22.960 --> 08:24.629
Well this article
says you can.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.214
How?

08:26.297 --> 08:26.714
Kittens!!

08:26.797 --> 08:27.590
(kittens meowing)

08:28.799 --> 08:31.260
Awwwwwwww!

08:31.344 --> 08:36.140
Awww, look at the
widdle pawsies!

08:36.224 --> 08:41.145
Uhhh, I mean... Football.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.941
You don't know what
you're missin'

08:45.024 --> 08:47.068

Hailey and Tristan.

08:47.151 --> 08:50.613
Your eyes will be mistin' if you
don't vote Hailey and Tristan.

08:50.696 --> 08:54.742
Vote for Hailey and
Tristan, just do it, okay?

08:54.825 --> 08:56.953
It's exhausting
campaigning for two people.

08:57.036 --> 08:58.955
The rhymes alone
are wearing me out.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.666
It's like Tristan doesn't even
care about being Dance King.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.750
What gave you
that idea?

09:02.833 --> 09:05.962
Him saying, "I don't care
about being Dance King"?

09:06.045 --> 09:08.089
Can you tell this
is photoshopped?

09:08.172 --> 09:09.090
No.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.132
It's amazing what they
can do with computers.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.802
Just so you know, this whole
Dance King and Queen

09:12.885 --> 09:14.929
thing is a tall glass
of lame-onade.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.932
I mean, you'd have to be
crazy to spend so much time

09:18.015 --> 09:20.977
and effort for
some dumb prize.

09:21.060 --> 09:21.936
What's the
prize again?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.981
If you win -- unlikely --
you get a crown

09:25.064 --> 09:26.774
and the first dance
of the night with the queen.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.776
Me.

09:28.859 --> 09:29.986
Really?

09:30.069 --> 09:35.032
I mean -- this school deserves
a chance to see my moves.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.828
There's gonna
be food, right?

09:38.911 --> 09:39.704
{\an1}There's an
all-you-can-eat buffet.

09:39.787 --> 09:40.538
{\an3}I'm in!

09:40.621 --> 09:42.665
I'm going to
bankrupt this school!

09:42.748 --> 09:43.457
Ugh!

09:43.541 --> 09:44.750
You think this is
a whole joke!

09:44.834 --> 09:47.336
Well, it's serious
to some people.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.839
{\an7}You have your fun, but
it's going to be me

09:49.922 --> 09:51.007
{\an1}and Tristan wearing
those crowns

09:51.090 --> 09:53.718
{\an1}and you'll be drowning your
sorrows in pigs and a blanket!

09:53.801 --> 09:57.596
{\an1}Well get those pigs ready
cause this guys gonna be king.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.685
Gigi!

10:02.768 --> 10:04.312
Your campaigning for
Tristan is paying off.

10:04.395 --> 10:04.687
He's edging
out Brendoni.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.314
Ha!

10:06.397 --> 10:07.773
I knew it.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.823
I thought directing
kittens would be easier.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.825
Hey guys, I think we
should hurry up.

10:17.908 --> 10:21.370
The Cat Lady on my street
wants these back by five,

10:21.454 --> 10:23.205
and I sense she's
quick to anger.

10:24.123 --> 10:25.207
Allergies...

10:25.291 --> 10:26.876
Can't you reason
with these cats?

10:26.959 --> 10:28.085
They'll listen to you.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.211
I'm trying.

10:29.295 --> 10:31.380
But you have to remember,
they're basically babies.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.381
I knew it.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.382
(sneezing)

10:33.466 --> 10:34.759
We shoulda
gone full cat.

10:34.842 --> 10:38.262
Try Professor Mittens,
she's the most mature.

10:38.346 --> 10:39.639
I'm just gonna
start shooting.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.308
Whatever you
do, stay quiet.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.977
Hello, everyone.

10:45.061 --> 10:49.023
I'm sure these adorable kittens
made you click on this video,

10:49.106 --> 10:50.858
but hopefully you'll join
us to save Evermore Woods.

10:50.941 --> 10:52.610
Oh my face!

10:52.693 --> 10:53.402
Owe it's claws.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.403
Ahh!

10:54.487 --> 10:55.237
Get it off.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.915

No harm should come

11:07.792 --> 11:09.168
So come to

11:09.251 --> 11:10.252
He's eating
my brain!!

11:10.336 --> 11:11.295
{\an1}But he's
so cute!

11:11.379 --> 11:12.630
Quit provoking her.

11:12.713 --> 11:14.090
{\an3}Ahh!

11:14.173 --> 11:15.424
You're being
such a baby.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.717
What is going on?!

11:16.801 --> 11:17.009
Astral!

11:17.093 --> 11:19.095
Help.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.889
Maybe this'll help?

11:26.018 --> 11:30.147
Awe, you're
so sweet.

11:30.231 --> 11:31.440

of pure evil, ah!

11:36.862 --> 11:37.863
We're doomed.

11:42.243 --> 11:43.160
That was fun.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.829
Until they all started
coughing up furballs.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.914
That's what
life is.

11:46.997 --> 11:49.125
One giant furball hacked
up right in your lap.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.918
I really thought
this was gonna work.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.002
Hey, guys?

11:52.086 --> 11:54.296
I didn't wanna tell you,
but I figured what the hey,

11:54.380 --> 11:55.840
and I uploaded
Astral's video.

11:55.923 --> 11:56.841
Great.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.759
Now I can be both
homeless and a humiliated.

11:58.843 --> 11:59.635
Maybe not.

11:59.718 --> 12:00.803
I made a few
changes.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.972
No harm should come
to Evermore woods.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.890
It's got over
20,000 views!

12:04.974 --> 12:05.307
How?

12:05.391 --> 12:06.517
<i>My theory?</i>

12:06.600 --> 12:08.811
People secretly hate cats and
are waiting for a cat wreck,

12:08.894 --> 12:12.273
take that
professor Mittens.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.066
It's working.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.818
People are talking
about the woods.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.904
"That's where I proposed to
my wife. We have to save it"

12:18.988 --> 12:22.450
"I love that place,
protect the woods"

12:22.533 --> 12:24.869
"The girl chasing the
kittens is super cute."

12:24.952 --> 12:25.369
Wait, what?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.163
{\an1}Is there a
picture?

12:27.246 --> 12:28.497
{\an1}What do they
look like?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.331
Okay, come on.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.875
Back to business.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.001
<i>We'll gather.</i>

12:32.084 --> 12:32.835
We'll mobilize.

12:32.918 --> 12:36.839
And we will rock
those woods!

12:40.426 --> 12:41.302
<i>Right.</i>

12:41.385 --> 12:42.845
And we'll try to do

<i>Hailey: I can't believe</i>
<i>Astral's ahead in the polls.</i>

12:46.390 --> 12:49.518

12:50.895 --> 12:52.021
Politics.

12:52.104 --> 12:52.480
No.

12:52.563 --> 12:53.105
Fruit Smashies.

12:53.189 --> 12:53.939
I'm stuck on
level 129.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.861
As your King, I
will set the tone

12:58.944 --> 13:00.738
for this year's
social calendar.

13:00.821 --> 13:02.364
The dances will
blow your minds.

13:02.448 --> 13:03.908
Halls filled with
endless burritos.

13:03.991 --> 13:06.827
Homework will end and
parties will begin.

13:06.911 --> 13:12.374
For, under my regime, every
month will be ROCK-TOBER!!!

13:17.296 --> 13:19.548
Party on, Baby
Wets-a-lot, party on.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.050
<i>Cheap pandering.</i>

13:21.133 --> 13:22.343
No substance.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.595
He totally stole
my playbook!

13:24.929 --> 13:26.347
Enjoy it while
you can, Brendoni.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.391
Because nobody's going
to out-me me, except me.

13:29.475 --> 13:29.934

13:30.017 --> 13:31.185

what I mean.

13:31.268 --> 13:32.561
Come on,
let's go!

13:32.645 --> 13:32.937
Out of my way!

13:33.020 --> 13:34.522
No photos!

13:36.106 --> 13:37.399
Tristan!

13:37.483 --> 13:38.025
Buddy!

13:38.108 --> 13:39.235
No hard
feelings, right?

13:39.318 --> 13:42.404
Of course not man, you obviously
want it way more than I do.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.531
Or, at all.

13:43.614 --> 13:44.573
You've got
my vote.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.866
Thanks, man.

13:45.950 --> 13:46.909
Hey why is
your hand wet?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.078
Oh sorry.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.038
That baby needs
a change.

13:51.121 --> 13:55.167
Oh, man
come on!

13:55.459 --> 13:57.545
Save Evermore Woods.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.630
Save Evermore Woods.

13:59.713 --> 14:03.551
Save Evermore Woods.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.468
Sorry!

14:04.718 --> 14:05.886
Morgan, I need
more flyers.

14:05.970 --> 14:06.595
I run out!

14:06.679 --> 14:07.596
Me, too.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.931
But it's okay, we're
all over social media.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.392
We can shift our
campaign online.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.601
Good.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.895
'Cause saving trees by handing
out fliers made out of trees

14:14.979 --> 14:16.397
seemed to send
the wrong message.

14:16.480 --> 14:17.481
Hey, Astral.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.608
I want to help out with the
campaign however I can.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.111
I've got a lot of nice
memories of the woods.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.112
Like what?

14:23.195 --> 14:25.447
Once I found a fully
intact snake skeleton.

14:25.531 --> 14:30.077
And, of course, it's
where I got to know you.

14:34.331 --> 14:35.291
Hey Astral.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.417
I just got
an e-mail.

14:36.500 --> 14:40.087
Channel 1 News wants to
interview us about our video.

14:40.170 --> 14:42.256
That's amazing!

14:42.339 --> 14:43.424
There's one
condition,

14:43.507 --> 14:48.679
"The fruit hat boy needs to
be there in full costume."

14:48.762 --> 14:51.015
Uh-uh, my fruit hat
days are done.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.975
Devon, please.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.268
Do it for the
woods.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.728
Bro.

14:58.188 --> 15:00.858
Hello again,
old friend.

15:00.941 --> 15:03.444
It's time to face
the music.

15:03.527 --> 15:05.362
Great, let's do
the interview.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.366
We are running out
of options, Titania.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.868
We must think
about the kingdom.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.286
I have faith
in Astral.

15:12.369 --> 15:13.621
Just give
her time.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.165
Hello, your
royalness-es.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.542
Are you looking
at my wings?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.210
I know, shocking.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.088
I was speechless for about
seven and a half seconds!

15:23.172 --> 15:26.091
Now allow me to
demonstrate.

15:26.175 --> 15:29.136
Ah, is she gonna
be alright?

15:29.219 --> 15:31.180
I think the stress of
not having wings

15:31.263 --> 15:33.557
has made her a
little...nutty--

15:33.641 --> 15:35.017
Woosh! Wooooosh,
ha, ha.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.727
--er.

15:37.061 --> 15:38.312
<i>Good show</i>
<i>Peasy!</i>

15:38.395 --> 15:39.438
I can barely
see you!

15:39.521 --> 15:42.024
I'm so high up in the air,
everything is teeny tiny.

15:42.107 --> 15:42.900
(clears throat)

15:42.983 --> 15:45.903
My lord, you have
no time to waste.

15:45.986 --> 15:49.531
Our annihilation grows
closer with every passing hour.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.700
Yes, a fact I know
all too well.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.535
Then we must work
on our plans!

15:53.619 --> 15:54.370
Wait.

15:54.453 --> 15:55.537
We have been
fighting for so long,

15:55.621 --> 15:58.540
I just want to see the
fairies that we're fighting for.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.166
Ridiculous.

15:59.249 --> 16:02.002
I'm up so high!

16:02.086 --> 16:03.671
They all look
like little ants!

16:03.754 --> 16:05.255
I think those
are actual ants.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.257
Yep, she's, she's
standing on an anthill.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.510
And now for my
grand finale:

16:09.593 --> 16:14.640
a triple flap-tastic
somersault dismount, wheww.

16:14.723 --> 16:15.766
Oh, Peasey--

16:20.646 --> 16:22.523
Okay! I admit it!

16:22.606 --> 16:23.524
I'm a fraud!

16:23.607 --> 16:27.403
I didn't really get my
wings, just two fronds!
