WEBVTT

00:01.827 --> 00:04.743
Previously onDynasty...I flew in a very special guest.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.267
Try not to wake the dead.

00:06.310 --> 00:07.833
A powerful betrayal

00:07.877 --> 00:09.748
around this bare-chested man.

00:09.792 --> 00:11.054
He's going to ask you
to marry him.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.230
And will I?Yes. Only...

00:13.274 --> 00:14.840
Only what?He will expire.

00:14.884 --> 00:16.625
FALLON: A divorce party,
and it's all the rage.

00:16.668 --> 00:18.366
Don't worry, I'm not gonna ask
for a last kiss.

00:21.064 --> 00:23.110
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Who the hell is that?

00:23.153 --> 00:25.286
I am starting to fall in love.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.070
Open your heart and let me in.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.246
I lost my job
in Arizona a week ago.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.683
It was fate. And you
have nowhere else to be

00:31.727 --> 00:32.815
because this is where
you belong.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.339
♪ Ooh

00:36.471 --> 00:38.690
♪ Hyperfocus my attention

00:38.734 --> 00:40.692
♪ On ya, baby...

00:40.736 --> 00:43.434
Are we sure
four turkeys is enough?

00:43.478 --> 00:44.696
Mr. Carrington is
insisting on keeping

00:44.740 --> 00:46.611
our Thanksgiving
festivities small.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.873
Because of last year?

00:47.917 --> 00:49.266
If a lunatic woman with a gun

00:49.310 --> 00:50.572
doesn't turn up tomorrow,

00:50.615 --> 00:52.443
it'll be a grand improvement.

00:52.487 --> 00:54.793
Has anyone seen my baster?

00:54.837 --> 00:56.360
I think Sam took it.

00:56.404 --> 00:57.883
♪ Gimme, gimme, gimme,
gimme, gimme, don't stop. ♪

00:57.927 --> 01:00.843
I know we haven't worked
out any of the details yet,

01:00.886 --> 01:03.367
but do you think I could get
an advance on my baby fee?

01:03.411 --> 01:06.370
We haven't discussed any
of the details.

01:06.414 --> 01:08.677
But we'll subtract what you put
on Steven's credit card

01:08.720 --> 01:11.158
in Paraguay
from your overall payment.Remember,

01:11.201 --> 01:12.333
they have to stick this

01:12.376 --> 01:13.856
up my down under.

01:13.899 --> 01:17.555
Not that specific one.
I doubt it's BYOB.

01:17.599 --> 01:18.643
Hmm?

01:18.687 --> 01:20.819
The second "B" is for "baster."

01:20.863 --> 01:22.169
KIRBY:
Oh.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.605
Hi, Daddy.

01:23.648 --> 01:24.780
I know I'm going to regret
asking this,

01:24.823 --> 01:26.303
but what exactly is going on?

01:26.347 --> 01:28.088
We're having a baby. We'renot having a baby.

01:28.131 --> 01:30.829
Though, I guess
technically we are,

01:30.873 --> 01:32.353
but it's for me and Steven.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.050
It'll be my sperm,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.400
and Kirby will provide the egg
and nine months of housing.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.228
And Steven will be back
before she gives birth,

01:38.272 --> 01:40.622
so we all go through
the process together.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.189
You're gonna be a grandfather.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.669
Yay.

01:44.713 --> 01:46.280
Yes, well, clearly,

01:46.323 --> 01:48.282
that's not going to happen.Why not?

01:48.325 --> 01:50.414
Because it's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.242
Of course you'd say that.
You've never supported

01:52.286 --> 01:54.070
anything I do.Have you ever considered

01:54.114 --> 01:56.333
going back to university
to find a purpose in life?

01:56.377 --> 01:58.770
Apart from... spawning.

01:58.814 --> 02:01.382
It's my belly.
My belly, my choice.

02:01.425 --> 02:03.514
ANDERS: This conversation
is not over.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.864
Keep that baster away
from the kitchen.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.957
MICHAEL:
You know,

02:12.001 --> 02:14.308
with that storm coming, your
dad's gonna have to cancel

02:14.351 --> 02:16.745
the annual football
game tomorrow. Too bad.

02:16.788 --> 02:18.355
Speaking of which,
I was thinking

02:18.399 --> 02:19.487
we should have your mother
and your sister

02:19.530 --> 02:20.879
over for Thanksgiving.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.751
You know, two families
becoming one and all that.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.319
Yeah, that's probably not
a good idea.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.451
You know, it's the first
Thanksgiving without my dad,

02:27.495 --> 02:30.193
so it's gonna be
a sensitive time.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.760
And topic.
Why?

02:31.803 --> 02:34.371
Because they blame my family
for your father's death?

02:35.329 --> 02:37.374
I'm sorry. That was insensitive.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.550
Well, they don't have
to come here. We can go there.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.031
I don't know, Fallon.Is there some kind of...

02:42.074 --> 02:44.164
neutral territory
we could meet up at?

02:44.207 --> 02:46.470
Perhaps the church soup line?
Or I could rent out

02:46.514 --> 02:47.384
Falcons stadium?

02:47.384 --> 02:52.215
Or does Luella plan on ignoring

02:52.259 --> 02:55.392
My mom doesn't know
that we're engaged.

02:55.436 --> 02:58.221
What

03:00.136 --> 03:02.791
Are you having second thoughts?
About this?

03:02.834 --> 03:05.185
What? No, of course not.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.230
Okay, well, I feel
like we need to be honest here.

03:07.274 --> 03:09.145
Not "lie by omission" honest.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.103
100% truth.

03:11.147 --> 03:12.714
Is there anything
you need to tell me?

03:12.757 --> 03:14.150
No.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.761
Fallon,
there's nothing going on.

03:16.805 --> 03:18.894
It just hasn't been
the right time to tell her.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.678
Okay. Well,
no time like today, then.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.071
I just have to gather
some things

03:22.114 --> 03:23.638
to be messengered over to C.A.--

03:23.681 --> 03:26.031
well, I guess
it's not C.A. anymore--

03:26.075 --> 03:28.295
and then we can go see your mom
this afternoon.

03:28.338 --> 03:30.645
Just be sure to duck
if she reaches for her shoe.

03:30.688 --> 03:31.776
Deal.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.256
If I could have
the kitchen, please?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.084
Thank you.

03:37.129 --> 03:40.524
Good morning.
Thanks for coming down.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.874
What are you up to?Well, I thought
I could make you breakfast

03:42.918 --> 03:46.791
and we can get to know
each other.Aren't you full of surprises?

03:49.707 --> 03:51.666
You know, uh...

03:51.709 --> 03:53.668
I've got another surprise.

03:53.711 --> 03:55.670
I don't want to have sex.

03:55.713 --> 03:58.238
In the kitchen or with me?

03:58.281 --> 04:00.979
Obviously, I want to have sex
with you. Look at you.

04:01.023 --> 04:03.982
I just want to do things
differently than I normally do.

04:04.026 --> 04:06.507
You know, my relationship
track record isn't exactly...

04:06.550 --> 04:08.770
Well, you've met Alexis.

04:08.813 --> 04:10.293
Look, I knew very little

04:10.337 --> 04:12.121
about Cristal-- Celia--

04:12.164 --> 04:14.254
and that caused
a lot of problems for us.

04:14.297 --> 04:16.125
And to avoid that,
I want to know

04:16.168 --> 04:18.127
everything there is to know
about Cristal Jennings.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.434
Sounds good. So...

04:20.477 --> 04:23.001
what's for breakfast?
Are you a good cook?

04:23.045 --> 04:26.309
Terrible. But...
I make a great Bellini.

04:26.353 --> 04:30.139
You know
that's a mimosa, right?

04:31.532 --> 04:33.011
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry to interrupt.

04:33.055 --> 04:35.492
Dr. Dixon is here to
give you a physical

04:35.536 --> 04:37.015
for the life insurance update.

04:37.059 --> 04:39.017
Okay.

04:39.061 --> 04:41.890
And a package arrived for you.
I've had it placed in your room.

04:41.933 --> 04:43.065
Gracias.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.458
To be continued.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.679
ALEXIS:
Oh! What are you cleaning with?

04:48.723 --> 04:49.637
Napalm?

04:49.680 --> 04:51.160
It's what I always use.

04:51.203 --> 04:53.162
Oh, so Blake's been inhaling
these toxins every day?

04:53.205 --> 04:55.338
I need you to get rid
of any household product

04:55.382 --> 04:57.340
that is not organic.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.168
Says the woman
who's half synthetic.

04:59.211 --> 05:01.126
Is this your new way
of moving in on Dad?

05:01.170 --> 05:03.041
Taking the head
housekeeping job?

05:03.085 --> 05:04.782
For your information,
I am trying

05:04.826 --> 05:06.131
to save your father's life.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.220
By nagging him to death
yourself?

05:08.264 --> 05:10.135
No. I...

05:10.179 --> 05:11.659
Well, I saw that psychic,

05:11.702 --> 05:13.269
and she told me

05:13.313 --> 05:15.445
that Blake and I
are meant to be together.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.013
But she also said
that he was gonna die.

05:18.056 --> 05:19.275
And you believed her?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.016
I wouldn't be able
to live with myself

05:21.059 --> 05:24.149
if I ignored it and something
awful happened.Oh, I get it.

05:24.193 --> 05:26.238
You think
if you can keep Dad alive,

05:26.282 --> 05:27.849
you two could still be together,

05:27.892 --> 05:29.459
reclaiming your throne
and his money.

05:29.503 --> 05:31.418
This has nothing to do
with money.Oh, please.

05:31.461 --> 05:34.159
Even you don't believe
your own lies anymore.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.379
Besides, Blake is finally
in a good place.

05:36.423 --> 05:37.989
He seems to like
replacement Cristal,

05:38.033 --> 05:40.122
and the last thing he needs
is you following him around

05:40.165 --> 05:42.385
like some fairy godmother
of death prevention.

05:42.429 --> 05:44.605
And what about
what the psychic said to you?

05:44.648 --> 05:47.042
About love, betrayal
and the ultimate kiss?

05:47.085 --> 05:50.175
Was there any truth to that?

05:50.219 --> 05:52.961
No. No, of course not.

05:53.004 --> 05:55.485
Now who's lying?

06:08.585 --> 06:11.283
Severance pay?

06:11.327 --> 06:14.983
$500,000.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.743
LIAM:
Weird, isn't it?

06:38.180 --> 06:41.705
Yeah. It's like Carrington
Atlantic never existed.

06:41.749 --> 06:43.968
I just came to drop off
some things. Some keys,

06:44.012 --> 06:45.840
badges, security cards.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.711
Oh, because there's no one on
your staff you could've sent?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.104
Can't you just admit

06:49.147 --> 06:50.148
you wanted to see me?I'd admit it

06:50.192 --> 06:51.628
if it were true.

06:51.672 --> 06:54.979
But no, actually,
I just came to...

06:55.023 --> 06:56.981
to get this lamp.

06:57.025 --> 06:59.331
So we're not gonna talk

06:59.375 --> 07:02.334
about our little divorce
party make out session?

07:02.378 --> 07:04.728
Well, there's nothing
to talk about.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.034
It was a mistake.

07:06.077 --> 07:07.078
Fallon, stop.

07:10.212 --> 07:13.302
I mean, you've given me
this song and dance before.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.609
I know what you want.
You know what you want.

07:15.652 --> 07:17.219
And just because
you're afraid to say it

07:17.262 --> 07:19.047
doesn't make it any less true.

07:21.353 --> 07:24.618
But I'm done being your backup,
so here's the deal.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.881
Try to go the whole weekend

07:26.924 --> 07:29.753
without thinking about me
or that kiss.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.712
And when you can't
stop replaying it,

07:31.755 --> 07:35.977
then you'll know you should be
with me and not Culhane.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.631
Oh, please.I'm serious, okay?

07:37.674 --> 07:39.284
I'm going on a four-week
trip to Dubai,

07:39.328 --> 07:42.505
Paris, Vienna.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.334
I'll be at the airport
Monday morning.

07:45.377 --> 07:47.118
Now, either I see you there,

07:47.162 --> 07:50.165
or this is good-bye.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.269
♪

08:31.859 --> 08:35.645
Since our breakfast
was interrupted,

08:35.689 --> 08:37.429
how does lunch sound?

08:37.473 --> 08:40.824
You know, I've been
craving some quiet, alone,

08:40.868 --> 08:42.870
but totally taking it
slow time with you.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.960
Well, what luck. I think
that's on today's menu.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.963
Well, I hate to tell you this,
but it just started raining.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.139
Or can Blake Carrington
control the clouds?

08:51.182 --> 08:53.141
I can fly you to better weather.

08:53.184 --> 08:54.403
What about your family?

08:54.446 --> 08:55.796
It's Thanksgiving tomorrow.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.972
I suppose,
but given all the changes

08:58.015 --> 08:59.843
that have happened
in this family in the last year,

08:59.887 --> 09:01.932
might be time
for some new traditions.

09:01.976 --> 09:04.152
If that's what you want.

09:04.195 --> 09:06.241
But on one condition.

09:06.284 --> 09:08.504
Hmm?No lobstertinis.

09:10.288 --> 09:12.595
How was the office?Oh, it was fine.
They just needed me

09:12.639 --> 09:14.684
to come in to sign
a bunch of paperwork in person.

09:14.728 --> 09:15.990
It's no big deal.

09:16.033 --> 09:18.688
Wow, you're usually a
better liar than that.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.690
No big deal?

09:20.734 --> 09:22.387
Leaving your family's company,

09:22.431 --> 09:23.954
C.A., has got to be
like breaking up

09:23.998 --> 09:25.173
with your first love.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.870
Well, as they say:

09:26.914 --> 09:29.917
when one door closes,
another door opens...

09:29.960 --> 09:32.049
to your future mother-in-law.

09:32.093 --> 09:34.095
Hey, Mom.Hey.

09:34.138 --> 09:35.270
Hello, Luella.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.620
Are you two
still seeing each other?

09:37.664 --> 09:40.623
Not only are we still seeing
each other, but...

09:40.667 --> 09:41.929
we're engaged.

09:44.148 --> 09:47.151
I didn't see that coming.That's why we're here.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.936
Seeing as it's our first
Thanksgiving as a couple,

09:48.979 --> 09:51.460
I would be honored
to invite you and Evie over

09:51.503 --> 09:52.983
for dinner tomorrow at my house.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.725
Well, I-I'm sorry
you came all this way,

09:55.769 --> 09:57.335
but as you already know,

09:57.379 --> 10:00.034
I'll be spending Thanksgiving
the way I do every year:

10:00.077 --> 10:02.993

approval for a relationship.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.804
But I want it.
It's important to me.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.198
You have mine. Why do
you need anybody else's?

19:16.242 --> 19:18.896
A shrink once told me
that I seek others' approval

19:18.940 --> 19:21.072
to fill the hole left
by my mother's abandonment.

19:21.116 --> 19:24.032
Clearly, I never
went back to that guy.

19:24.075 --> 19:25.860
Excuse me.
We need more yams.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.862
We try to do this every year,
give back to the community.Thank you.

19:27.905 --> 19:29.559
It's just too bad
the other buses didn't make it.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.693
You're a very
generous man.

19:35.043 --> 19:38.916
When we're done
helping out the needy,

19:38.960 --> 19:41.484
why don't you meet me
downstairs in the wine cellar?

19:41.528 --> 19:44.879
Aren't you afraid that I might
kill you like Alexis said?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.315
I'll take my chances.

19:54.062 --> 19:56.586
This piano cost more
than my last house,

19:56.630 --> 19:58.371
so maybe tell the kid
to go easy on the keys?

19:58.414 --> 20:00.199
You're starting
to sound like my dad.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.983
How much have you had
to drink?
A lot.

20:02.026 --> 20:05.987
No, no. Don't be mad.
I'm being responsible.

20:06.030 --> 20:08.032
Go get some dessert, kid.

20:08.076 --> 20:10.383
And how exactly
is this responsible?

20:10.426 --> 20:12.080
I'm not gonna be able to drink

20:12.123 --> 20:13.864
or do anything fun
when I'm pregnant, right?

20:13.908 --> 20:15.997
So I figure why not
squeeze nine months

20:16.040 --> 20:17.999
of partying into three days?

20:18.042 --> 20:20.958
See? Responsible and efficient.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.482
Look, Kirby... we...

20:22.525 --> 20:23.961
Mm. Just don't
tell my dad.

20:24.005 --> 20:26.181
Okay? He'll judge me more
than he already does.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.661
He doesn't judge you.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.577
He just sounds that way
because he's old and cranky.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.753
Nice try,

20:32.796 --> 20:35.756
but he has sounded that way
my entire life.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.976
I think maybe

20:39.020 --> 20:42.197
we need to have a talk.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.068
Fallon.

20:44.112 --> 20:46.070
Fallon?

20:46.114 --> 20:49.378
Did you call me over here
to serve you yams?

20:49.422 --> 20:50.640
Because that's not happening.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.033
No. Actually, I called you over

20:52.076 --> 20:53.904
to see how you're doing
with all this weather.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.950
Oh, that's sweet,
but I don't need your mothering.

20:55.993 --> 20:58.257
I have pills that do
a much better job of that.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.997
You know, I never should have
let the nanny read you

21:00.041 --> 21:02.217
The Wizard of Oz
at such a young age.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.001
Course, it was
your father's idea.

21:04.045 --> 21:05.873
Speaking of which--
do you know where he is?

21:05.916 --> 21:08.005
Oh, the last time I saw him,

21:08.049 --> 21:10.051
I think Cristal
was just about to kill him.

21:10.094 --> 21:11.879
You won't be laughing
when he's dead.

21:11.922 --> 21:13.184
And if it's isn't Cristal,

21:13.228 --> 21:14.751
it'll be one of those
vagrants you invited.

21:14.795 --> 21:18.015
I'm already missing my
mother's favorite antique

21:18.059 --> 21:19.626
Staffordshire cow creamer.

21:19.669 --> 21:21.845
Good timing as always, Mother.
I need to go eat.

21:25.066 --> 21:27.677
Peace, finally.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.418
This was definitely
one of my better ideas.

21:29.462 --> 21:31.594
It's very beautiful.You should see it
from where I sit.

21:31.638 --> 21:35.206
To us getting to know
each other... alone.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.599
Salud.

21:36.643 --> 21:37.905
SAM:
You were right.

21:37.948 --> 21:40.299
This Kirby thing
isn't gonna work.

21:40.342 --> 21:42.910
Well, naturally,
I'm delighted

21:42.953 --> 21:45.129
that you've come to your senses,
but what changed your mind?

21:45.173 --> 21:47.828
Well, I didn't realize, but she
really is kind of insane.

21:47.871 --> 21:49.220
That's a little extreme.Really?

21:49.264 --> 21:51.222
Last time I saw her
she was showing the church kids

21:51.266 --> 21:52.702
how to do tequila shots.

21:52.746 --> 21:55.270
I'm worried that she'll
be teaching Sammy 2.Jo

21:55.314 --> 21:57.403
how to set the manor on fire
before he can walk.

21:57.446 --> 21:58.534
That's enough, Sam.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.667
Kirby's still my daughter.

22:00.710 --> 22:03.017
And she has some
wonderful qualities

22:03.060 --> 22:05.193
that sometimes get overlooked

22:05.236 --> 22:07.935
because of her wild nature.

22:07.978 --> 22:09.066
She's has a rough life.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.547
Deep down inside, she's a...

22:11.591 --> 22:13.723
a caring, passionate girl.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.377
DIGITAL VOICE:
This a tornado alert.

22:15.421 --> 22:16.596
Seek shelter immediately.

22:19.163 --> 22:21.383
This is a tornado alert.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.385
Seek shelter immediately.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.821
Please listen up.

22:24.865 --> 22:27.128
Uh, for safety's sake,
will everyone

22:27.171 --> 22:30.261
please follow the staff
to the butler's pantry?

22:30.305 --> 22:31.785
We need to move to the cellar.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.091
This way.
Thank you.

22:34.135 --> 22:36.180
DIGITAL VOICE:
Seek shelter immediately.

22:36.224 --> 22:39.053
Anders, where is Blake?

22:39.096 --> 22:41.142
DIGITAL VOICE:
This is a tornado alert.

22:41.185 --> 22:43.536
Seek shelter immediately.

22:47.409 --> 22:49.803
Well, looks like
someone's having

22:49.846 --> 22:51.587
a leg, a breast
and a thigh.

22:51.631 --> 22:53.197
Can you two put
some clothes on?

22:53.241 --> 22:55.678
People need to take shelter.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.772
Excuse me.Mm-hmm.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.992
Did your mother seriously
call these people derelicts?

23:05.035 --> 23:07.821
Uh, well, technically,
she said "vagrants,"

23:07.864 --> 23:10.737
but, you know, I say
vagrants, you say potato.

23:10.780 --> 23:12.739
I'm buzzed.Well, whatever she said,

23:12.782 --> 23:14.393
my mother wants to leave
as soon as possible.

23:14.436 --> 23:16.133
Well, I'm sorry,
but she's stuck here.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.396
I'm sure she blames me

23:17.439 --> 23:19.049
for the tornado,
too. Right, Evie?

23:19.093 --> 23:20.877
Yeah, probably.

23:20.921 --> 23:23.184
See? So maybe if your mom
had more of an open mind,

23:23.227 --> 23:24.620
we could be having
a better time.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.144
Maybe if your mother
didn't trash my mom's church...

23:27.188 --> 23:29.320
No. My mom has been
on her best behavior.

23:29.364 --> 23:30.670
Trust me. My whole family has.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.499
Don't worry. We're perfectly
safe down here.

23:33.542 --> 23:35.501
Make yourselves comfortable
until the storm passes.

23:35.544 --> 23:37.154
Look, I know
she's being difficult,

23:37.198 --> 23:39.635
but maybe if you could just try
to apologize one more time.

23:39.679 --> 23:40.723
Oh, forget it.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.029
I can't be here right now.Fallon.

23:42.072 --> 23:43.204
Fallon. Where are you going?

23:43.247 --> 23:44.858
I got this.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.252
What is going on
with you?

23:48.296 --> 23:50.167
What's going on is that
if you don't stand up

23:50.211 --> 23:51.647
to your mother we are
never getting married,

23:51.691 --> 23:53.388
because you will never
do it without her blessing.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.216
I never said that.
Oh!

23:55.259 --> 23:56.870
So you're just gonna
cut her out of your life?

23:56.913 --> 23:57.958
You have lost your mind.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.089
You are not acting
like yourself.

23:59.133 --> 24:00.656
I'm not acting like myself?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.484
You have been a completely
different person

24:02.528 --> 24:04.181
ever since you got
back from New York.

24:04.225 --> 24:06.445
You have been distant,
you have been distracted,

24:06.488 --> 24:08.185
you're taking
secret phone calls...

24:08.229 --> 24:11.188
Can we-- Can we please
just get back downstairs

24:11.232 --> 24:13.016
As long as you tell me who the
woman was that you were with.

24:13.060 --> 24:14.061
What woman?

24:14.104 --> 24:15.802
I saw you at the divorce party.

24:15.845 --> 24:18.152
I saw you
and I-I gave you a chance

24:18.195 --> 24:19.370
to explain and you didn't.

24:19.414 --> 24:20.546
H-Hold on.
Were you spying on me?

24:20.589 --> 24:22.243
No, no, no, no, no.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.636
Don't you try to turn this
around on me.

24:23.679 --> 24:25.246
You are the one who's been
keeping secrets.

24:25.289 --> 24:26.290
Are you sure?

24:26.334 --> 24:27.553
Is this really about my mother

24:27.596 --> 24:29.250
or is something else
going on here, Fallon?

24:33.950 --> 24:35.996
Fallon!

24:41.305 --> 24:43.786
♪

24:43.830 --> 24:46.310
How did I get up here?

24:46.354 --> 24:48.356
Hello?

24:53.274 --> 24:55.232
Oh, my.

25:02.805 --> 25:03.632
Mom?

25:03.676 --> 25:04.981
Oh, no, my dear.

25:05.025 --> 25:07.157
I am the Good Witch
of the North.

25:07.201 --> 25:10.291
Really? 'Cause that is not the
witch I would have cast you as.

25:10.334 --> 25:12.293
You can't even be nice to
your own mother in your dream?

25:12.336 --> 25:15.557
Mm.Well, I have come here
to guide you on your journey.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.298
All you have to do is...

25:17.341 --> 25:18.342
Yes, I get it.

25:18.386 --> 25:19.648
I know the story.

25:19.692 --> 25:21.520
I have to find the wizard
so I can get home,

25:21.563 --> 25:23.522
or in this case, wake up.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.349
Just follow
the yellow brick road.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.706
Um... Daddy?

25:38.624 --> 25:40.321
Wait.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.757
My mom was right.

25:41.801 --> 25:43.063
You did want
to kill him.

25:43.106 --> 25:44.325
I didn't do anything.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.370
You killed him when
you sold his company

25:46.414 --> 25:47.328
out from under him.

25:47.371 --> 25:48.329
Poor Blake.

25:48.372 --> 25:49.635
Don't listen to her.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.376
That witch has got weapons
she's never used.

25:52.420 --> 25:54.422
I want to help Blake,
not hurt him.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.120
She's only here
for one reason: Money.

26:02.604 --> 26:05.128
And now they're yours.

26:05.172 --> 26:08.436
And that wicked witch
won't get her claws on them.

26:08.479 --> 26:10.438
How dare you.

26:22.798 --> 26:25.279
Oh.

26:25.322 --> 26:29.675
See, now I knew you couldn't
stop thinking about me.

26:29.718 --> 26:31.285
I wasn't thinking about you,
you forced your way

26:31.328 --> 26:32.373
into this crazy dream.

26:32.416 --> 26:33.679
I really need to get home.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.158
And you want me
to take you.

26:35.202 --> 26:36.377
Why do you think I'm here?

26:36.420 --> 26:37.944
I have no idea why you're here.

26:37.987 --> 26:40.468
I have no idea why you can't
get it through your straw head

26:40.511 --> 26:42.209
that I am with Culhane.

26:42.252 --> 26:43.689
It's like you
don't have any...
Brains.

26:43.732 --> 26:45.691
Well, if I don't...

26:45.734 --> 26:48.041
it's because I've lost
my mind for you.

26:48.084 --> 26:49.303
And I've just lost my mind.

26:49.346 --> 26:50.696
Look, I can take you

26:50.739 --> 26:53.046
to the wizard to get you home,

26:53.089 --> 26:54.569
but you need to free me.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.571
You seem perfectly
free to me.
It's a metaphor.

26:56.615 --> 27:00.357
And the only way to do it
is to give me a kiss.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.924
Hey, I don't make the rules.

27:09.671 --> 27:14.415
What the hell was that?

27:21.509 --> 27:23.250
Michael?

27:26.079 --> 27:27.471
What are you doing here?

27:27.515 --> 27:28.864
Well, I've been down here
for years.

27:28.908 --> 27:30.605
It's just you're the only one
who ever found me.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.302
Can't seem to move, though.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.477
I think I might need oil
or something.

27:33.521 --> 27:34.696
How about champagne?

27:40.746 --> 27:42.835
That'll do.

27:42.878 --> 27:45.576
What the hell
is he doing here?

27:45.620 --> 27:49.102
I thought you guys were
officially fake divorced.We are.

27:49.145 --> 27:50.233
He's just helping me get
to the wizard

27:50.277 --> 27:51.365
so that I can get home.

27:51.408 --> 27:53.584
You can come, too,
if you want.

27:53.628 --> 27:55.978
If you're not too busy.What else would I be
doing in your dream?

27:56.022 --> 27:57.719
I don't know.
You've been so secretive lately.

27:57.763 --> 27:59.590
You didn't even tell your mom
that we were engaged.

27:59.634 --> 28:00.679
Oh, that is heartless.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.811
No one's talking
to you, Straw Man.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.204
FALLON:
You know what?

28:04.247 --> 28:05.640
I think I'll go find
the wizard myself.

28:07.816 --> 28:09.209
There's no way in
hell I'm skipping.

28:09.252 --> 28:12.778
Well, maybe the wizard
is in the office.

the Emerald City already

28:50.598 --> 28:53.340
and find you the wizard.

28:57.823 --> 28:59.520
LUELLA:
Who dares enter?

28:59.563 --> 29:02.218
My mom's the wizard.
Sweet.

29:02.262 --> 29:03.306
Be quiet, son!

29:03.350 --> 29:06.353
I am the great
and terrible wizard.

29:06.396 --> 29:07.920
Why are you here?

29:07.963 --> 29:11.924
Man, you grew up with that?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.143
Mrs. Culhane?

29:14.187 --> 29:15.710
Your Wizardness?

29:15.754 --> 29:19.670
Um, I'm here, so could you
please tell me how to get home?

29:19.714 --> 29:23.631
We came all this way to find
your from... the other room.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.459
Getting home is very simple.

29:25.502 --> 29:28.070
Just end your engagement
to my son.

29:28.114 --> 29:29.463
What

29:29.506 --> 29:31.291
The wizard will never
give you her blessing.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.423
Or approve of this at all.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.469
Are you listening, Michael?

29:35.512 --> 29:37.514
A boy should listen
to his mother.

29:37.558 --> 29:38.907
FALLON:
Bo?

29:38.951 --> 29:41.780
LUELLA:
Stay away from there.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.085
Listen to me.

29:43.129 --> 29:44.478
♪

29:54.357 --> 29:56.620
Wait.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.274
You're the wizard?
I'm the wizard?

29:58.318 --> 30:01.495
We both know the only person
you'll listen to is yourself.

30:01.538 --> 30:03.627
So listen up.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.021
The reason you've been working
so hard for Luella's approval

30:06.065 --> 30:08.110
is because you know you're not
gonna be able to get it.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.720
But that makes no sense.Doesn't it?

30:09.764 --> 30:10.939
If you don't
get her approval,

30:10.983 --> 30:13.420
you won't have to make
the hard choice

30:13.463 --> 30:14.900
between the road
you're on with Culhane,

30:14.943 --> 30:17.163
or a new path with Liam.

30:17.206 --> 30:18.294
Oh. Th-th-that,
that's a good point.

30:18.338 --> 30:19.556
Is anyone else freaking out

30:19.600 --> 30:21.210
that there are two Fallons?

30:21.254 --> 30:22.472
Oh, yeah.This is all great,

30:22.516 --> 30:24.344
but could I please
just go home now?

30:24.387 --> 30:25.998
I'm exhausted and I could
really use a drink.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.303
Well, that depends.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.739
I mean, where is home?

30:28.783 --> 30:30.829
Who do you want
to go home to?

30:30.872 --> 30:32.526
The choice is yours.

30:45.278 --> 30:47.149
Oh, nice try.

30:47.193 --> 30:49.804
You know, if you
don't choose,

30:49.848 --> 30:52.546
we can just be alone together
for the rest of our lives.

30:52.589 --> 30:55.723
I'm into it.

30:58.682 --> 30:59.901
Mm.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.686
CULHANE:
Fallon.

31:02.730 --> 31:04.906
ALEXIS: Fallon.CULHANE: Fallon.

31:07.039 --> 31:08.214
How are you feeling?

31:09.302 --> 31:12.566
I'm confused.

31:12.609 --> 31:14.002
Any my head hurts.

31:14.046 --> 31:17.136
I'm so relieved you and
your father are okay.

31:17.179 --> 31:19.094
Would you see if you
can find Anders

31:19.138 --> 31:20.704
and get an ETA
on the medic?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.011
ANDERS:
Yes, I know it's Thanksgiving,

31:23.055 --> 31:25.622
but we need someone here
tonight.

31:25.666 --> 31:29.670
Mr. Carrington will send
his own chopper if need be.

31:29.713 --> 31:30.932
It behooves you to remember

31:30.976 --> 31:32.803
who paid for
the fourth floor clinic

31:32.847 --> 31:34.153
in the east wing
of your hospital.

31:36.546 --> 31:37.808
Thank you.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.506
The medic will be here shortly.

31:39.549 --> 31:41.116
I'll just let
Mr. Carrington know.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.032
Mr. Anders, does the name
Blue Belt mean anything to you?

31:44.076 --> 31:46.556
Bye Bye Blue Belt? Mr.
Carrington's favorite racehorse.

31:46.600 --> 31:48.689
The pride of the stables.

31:48.732 --> 31:50.169
I guess you're looking
at this picture of him.

31:50.212 --> 31:52.606
A fine, fine specimen.

32:07.751 --> 32:09.362
I'm sorry
we've been fighting.

32:09.405 --> 32:13.366
But that woman
was just business.

32:13.409 --> 32:16.978
If we can
just hit reset,

32:17.022 --> 32:19.763
I promise it'll
get better.

32:23.245 --> 32:25.291
I'm sorry, too.

32:28.250 --> 32:30.339
I don't mean
to interrupt.

32:31.688 --> 32:34.169
I was just going
to get Fallon some water.

32:40.523 --> 32:44.832
Well, I'm glad to see
you're okay.

32:44.875 --> 32:48.749
I can also see
how much my son cares for you.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.056
But it worries me that,
when it comes to you,

32:51.099 --> 32:52.753
Michael is defenseless.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.798
I love your son, Mrs. Culhane.

32:54.842 --> 32:56.017
I know that.

32:56.061 --> 32:57.845
I witnessed that love tonight.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.804
I also saw you trying
to do something

33:00.848 --> 33:02.589
for someone else.

33:02.632 --> 33:05.374
Even if you did seem crazy.

33:07.594 --> 33:09.030
Just...

33:09.074 --> 33:12.294
don't you break my son's heart.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.950
'Cause I can be terrible.

33:22.913 --> 33:24.045
Hello?

33:24.089 --> 33:26.830
Is somebody there?

33:28.876 --> 33:31.052
What are you doing,
creeping around?

33:31.096 --> 33:32.271
You've been acting
like a lunatic,

33:32.314 --> 33:33.750
at least more than usual,
lately.

33:33.794 --> 33:35.056
I've been trying to protect you.

33:35.100 --> 33:36.927
The psychic predicted
that you were going to...

33:36.971 --> 33:38.059
well, that...

33:38.103 --> 33:40.279
...that you were
going to expire.

33:40.322 --> 33:42.237
And she also said
that, well,

33:42.281 --> 33:43.499
we're meant to be together.

33:43.543 --> 33:45.023
We're all gonna expire someday.

33:45.066 --> 33:47.851
That doesn't mean I need you
shadowing me everywhere.

33:47.895 --> 33:50.332
Life's too short
to deny your destiny.

33:52.552 --> 33:54.684
I've been patient with you.

33:54.728 --> 33:56.773
But you got to get it
through your head.

33:56.817 --> 33:58.906
You and I are done, forever.

33:58.949 --> 34:00.560
And if you don't get
your act together,

34:00.603 --> 34:02.779
you're gonna lose everyone,
including your daughter.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.267
You don't have to clean that up.It's all good.

34:12.311 --> 34:14.443
No, Kirby, it's not.

34:14.487 --> 34:15.879
I've been treating
you unfairly.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.620
I-I'm sorry.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.709
I should have supported
you right from the start.

34:19.753 --> 34:22.495
And instead of trying
to block this pregnancy,

34:22.538 --> 34:25.150
I'd like to help you
every step of the way.

34:25.193 --> 34:28.588
And I'd like you to...
come and live here.

34:28.631 --> 34:29.806
Really?

34:31.939 --> 34:34.637
I'd like that.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.858
Except Sam decided
it would be too complicated

34:37.901 --> 34:39.164
for me to carry the baby.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.687
Oh. Well.

34:40.730 --> 34:41.949
I'm sorry.

34:41.992 --> 34:43.777
It's probably for the best.Baby or no baby,

34:43.820 --> 34:45.909
I'd still like you
to move in here.

34:48.042 --> 34:49.783
I miss you.

34:50.827 --> 34:52.960
Dad.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.322
Good, then.

35:14.242 --> 35:15.417
:
So?

35:15.461 --> 35:17.811
Your plan worked.

35:17.854 --> 35:19.987
You must have trash-talked me
really good

35:20.030 --> 35:21.597
for him to come around
like that.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.425
Tried-and-true
reverse psychology.

35:23.469 --> 35:25.427
Just because you aren't
the right candidate

35:25.471 --> 35:27.429
to help me start myfamily,

35:27.473 --> 35:29.823
I still wanted to help you
with yours.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.178
Alexis knows

35:37.222 --> 35:38.440
where to meet me?Yep.

35:38.484 --> 35:40.050
A park about 45 minutes
from here.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.182
Just like we planned.

35:41.226 --> 35:42.227
Good job.

35:42.270 --> 35:43.576
For once.

35:43.619 --> 35:44.925
All right,
I'll be back in two hours,

35:44.968 --> 35:47.014
I'll have the money,
and this will all be over.

35:47.057 --> 35:48.233
:
Unlike you,

35:48.276 --> 35:50.235
I actually know
how to get things done.

35:50.278 --> 35:51.584
Oh. And, remember,

35:51.627 --> 35:53.716
if Matthew wakes up,
let him cry.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.240
Right. Sleep training.

36:10.255 --> 36:12.648
Shh. Everything's gonna be fine.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.650
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:14.694 --> 36:15.825
Hey.

36:15.869 --> 36:18.176
Everything's gonna be fine.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.742
ALEXIS:
Knock, knock.

36:19.786 --> 36:20.830
You up for a visitor?

36:21.875 --> 36:24.921
If that's ginger tea, then yes.

36:26.271 --> 36:29.230
I'm sorry
about the last few days.

36:29.274 --> 36:33.843
I let that crazy psychic
get to me.

36:33.887 --> 36:36.672
Or maybe I was just trying
to convince myself

36:36.716 --> 36:38.500
that... it was real

36:38.544 --> 36:41.286
so that I could be
a hero to Blake.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.897
I think you're forgetting
what life with Daddy was like.

36:43.940 --> 36:46.291
It wasn't exactly rainbows
and munchkins.

36:46.334 --> 36:47.901
I know.

36:47.944 --> 36:50.295
But sometimes it's easier
to have the perfect relationship

36:50.338 --> 36:51.731
when it stays in...

36:51.774 --> 36:52.949
a fantasy world.

36:53.994 --> 36:55.778
Yeah. That's true.

36:55.822 --> 36:58.607
And it's always good
to know when to let go

36:58.651 --> 37:00.305
and face reality.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.655
But, honestly, it's, um...

37:02.698 --> 37:05.266
...it's quite daunting,

37:05.310 --> 37:07.355
having to figure it out alone.

37:12.665 --> 37:14.667
Wait.

37:19.498 --> 37:21.456
You know, some days,

37:21.500 --> 37:25.460
I can't decide if you're the
good witch or the bad witch.

37:25.504 --> 37:28.898
Or one of those freaky
flying monkeys.

37:28.942 --> 37:32.250
And this may be the
concussion talking, but...

37:33.294 --> 37:35.122
...you're still my mom.

37:38.778 --> 37:40.040
Fallon...

37:40.083 --> 37:43.391
Facing reality is more expensive
than you think.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.045
Or so I've heard.

37:49.658 --> 37:51.617
There you are.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.011
Everything okay?
Blue Belt?

37:55.055 --> 37:57.492
Either it's really
coincidental

37:57.536 --> 37:59.886
that the wine you drink,
your favorite horse,

37:59.929 --> 38:02.149
and the shell company
that bought the clinic

38:02.192 --> 38:03.890
all share the same name,

38:03.933 --> 38:06.849
or you're the reason
I lost my job.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.158
You're right.

38:11.201 --> 38:12.333
I am.

38:12.377 --> 38:14.944
I was in
a dark place.

38:14.988 --> 38:16.859
I had just found out
my son wasn't mine.

38:16.903 --> 38:19.035
And I didn't want
to lose a chance to know you.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.821
It was the best way I could
think of to get you to stay.

38:21.864 --> 38:23.823
Buying and then closing
an entire clinic?

38:23.866 --> 38:25.955
Everyone that worked there
was generously taken care of.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
I have very bad habits.

38:37.402 --> 38:38.968
I always get what I want.

38:40.883 --> 38:42.276
I understand
how this sounds,

38:42.320 --> 38:43.582
but I've never cared
for someone

38:43.625 --> 38:45.018
as intensely as
I care for you.

38:45.061 --> 38:46.672
So I can't stop myself,

38:46.715 --> 38:48.195
and I don't want to stop myself.

38:48.238 --> 38:51.416
I find you incredibly sexy.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.939
There's nothing
more attractive

38:52.982 --> 38:54.941
than a man who
knows what he wants

38:54.984 --> 38:56.856
and does what it
takes to get it.

38:56.899 --> 38:59.946
But for this to work--
and I do want it to, Blake--

38:59.989 --> 39:03.428
you have to let me know you
completely.

39:03.471 --> 39:06.344
No matter what you fear
my reaction might be.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.609
Okay.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.874
You want to know me?

39:17.703 --> 39:19.400
I don't like to play games.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.097
I don't like to waste time.

39:21.141 --> 39:23.491
And I didn't believe in fate

39:23.535 --> 39:25.188
until I met you.

39:25.232 --> 39:27.539
And today reminded me
that life is too short

39:27.582 --> 39:28.757
to wait for what you want.

39:28.801 --> 39:30.411
♪

39:30.455 --> 39:32.457
Marry me.

39:35.982 --> 39:38.376

Okay.

What's that?

39:53.478 --> 39:55.654
You were right.

39:55.697 --> 39:58.483
The other day in my office,

39:58.526 --> 40:00.136
that was good-bye.

40:01.747 --> 40:04.227
I can't do this anymore.

40:04.271 --> 40:06.229
I love Culhane,

40:06.273 --> 40:08.928
and what he and I
have together is real.

40:08.971 --> 40:11.626
