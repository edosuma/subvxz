WEBVTT

00:03.960 --> 00:06.310
Reese, I just bought that
for you.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.834
Will you look at--
Give it to me.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.706
Let me see what
I can do with it.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.926
I sneezed in chem lab
and spilled acid on it.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.019
I'm not wearing
these stupid shorts anymore.

00:19.106 --> 00:22.022
Everyone's making fun of me.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.849
[laughs]

00:23.936 --> 00:25.590
Oh!

00:25.677 --> 00:27.810
A denim tie.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.899
How cool is that?

That's awesome.

01:08.459 --> 01:11.462
Okay.
I can't wait to see you.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.551
No, I can't wait
to see you more.

01:13.638 --> 01:16.554
No, I can't wait to
see you more.

01:16.641 --> 01:18.252
Okay, you win. All right,

01:18.339 --> 01:19.383
Cindy's only
a few blocks away,

01:19.470 --> 01:21.211
so everybody calm down.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.605
When she gets here,
just try to be cool.

01:23.692 --> 01:24.954
I want to make
a good impression.

01:25.041 --> 01:26.738
Do I have a bat in the hanger?

01:26.825 --> 01:28.610
You've asked me five times.
The answer's still yes.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.003
So, this is
pretty exciting, Reese.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.222
When did you meet this
girl?

01:32.309 --> 01:33.528
I haven't actually met her.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.269
Her cousin goes
to school with me,

01:35.356 --> 01:37.140
and Cindy saw me at the dance
last week and thought I was hot.

01:37.227 --> 01:38.750
Oh, well, I don't blame her.

01:38.837 --> 01:40.535
I mean, forgetting
I'm your mother for a minute,

01:40.622 --> 01:42.450
if I saw you walking
down the street,

01:42.537 --> 01:45.496
I would think,
"There is one hot guy."

01:45.583 --> 01:47.455
Yeesh.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.239
Cindy and I talked on the phone
almost every night last week,

01:49.326 --> 01:50.980
and we totally have
the same sense of humor.

01:51.067 --> 01:52.373
She said she saw me put

01:52.460 --> 01:53.809
the plastic dog poop
in the punch bowl

01:53.896 --> 01:55.332
at the school dance,
and we both agreed

01:55.419 --> 01:56.899
that the real stuff
would have been funnier.

01:56.986 --> 02:00.207
You put plastic poop
in the punch bowl?

02:00.294 --> 02:02.165
Once again, you completely
miss the point.

02:04.341 --> 02:07.736
So, what kind of loser would
want to go out with you?

02:07.823 --> 02:10.259
-This kind of loser.
-Wow.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.523
And if she kisses half as good
as her picture does,

02:12.610 --> 02:14.177
-this is gonna be sweet.
-[doorbell rings]

02:14.264 --> 02:15.570
Okay, there she is.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.093
Everybody, get out of here.
No, wait.

02:17.180 --> 02:18.747
She'll probably want
to meet you.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.618
Okay, you can stay,
just don't say anything stupid.

02:21.619 --> 02:23.839
Oh! How's my hair?
Can you smell my pits?

02:23.926 --> 02:26.711
Why'd you let me put on
this stupid shirt?

02:26.798 --> 02:29.279
Reese, relax. All you have
to do is just be yourself.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.673
You're right, Mom.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.805
Thanks.

02:39.811 --> 02:42.031
[snorting]

02:42.118 --> 02:44.773
[girls laughing]

02:44.860 --> 02:47.384
Enjoy your date, Reese!
[giggling]

02:47.471 --> 02:49.169
-Bye, Reese!
-[snorting]

02:52.259 --> 02:53.608
[tires squealing]

02:53.695 --> 02:56.828
And the pig was actually
wearing lipstick?

02:56.915 --> 02:58.395
Reese was devastated.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.050
I can just imagine.
And-And I don't like it.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.704
No, no, no, not one little bit.

03:02.791 --> 03:06.577
Now, uh, what is it
that you want me to do?

03:06.664 --> 03:09.145
Look, I know that Reese
has not been a model student,

03:09.232 --> 03:11.539
and once again, I want to
apologize for your tires.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.062
-Ah.
-And your mailbox.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.107
And your lawn fountain.
But...

03:15.195 --> 03:16.457
what those girls did
is just cruel,

03:16.544 --> 03:18.023
and I need to see them punished.

03:18.110 --> 03:19.590
All right, you let me see
what I can find out.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.202
Now, these girls
are obviously quite clever.

03:22.289 --> 03:25.596
I mean, where do you even
find a pig?

03:25.683 --> 03:27.381
And then we have to get it over
to your house, and...

03:27.468 --> 03:29.426
put makeup on it.

03:29.513 --> 03:32.299
Reese was completely
blindsided, huh?

03:32.386 --> 03:34.605
You know what?
I have had it.

03:34.692 --> 03:36.912
How would you like it if I
called the superintendent

03:36.999 --> 03:38.740
and told him all about this?

03:38.827 --> 03:41.438
Great. I'll put him
on the speaker phone.
[laughs]

03:44.136 --> 03:46.008
[sighs]

04:03.721 --> 04:05.462
Unbelievable.

04:05.549 --> 04:08.291
I've never witnessed anything
like that in my entire life.

04:08.378 --> 04:09.684
Well, there's no excuse for it.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.425
How did an immature jerk
like that

04:11.512 --> 04:13.601
get to be principal
of a high school, Hal? How?

04:13.688 --> 04:15.255
-Well, with what they...
-He actually laughed.

04:15.342 --> 04:17.257
He couldn't care
less that our son

04:17.344 --> 04:19.998
is curled up on his
bed and completely
devastated by this.

04:21.478 --> 04:23.698
Honey, I think
you actually got chunks

04:23.785 --> 04:27.571
of cutting board in the salad.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.399
Well, I happen to
be very upset, Hal.

04:29.486 --> 04:30.748
I'm upset, too.

04:30.835 --> 04:33.055
And this principal sounds
like a real idiot,

04:33.142 --> 04:35.057
but you-you've talked to him,

04:35.144 --> 04:36.711
and if he's not going
to do anything about it,

04:36.798 --> 04:38.887
I don't see what else we can do.

04:38.974 --> 04:39.975
Well, you know what, Hal?

04:40.062 --> 04:41.368
That's just unacceptable to me.

04:41.455 --> 04:43.065
It's just the way it is.

04:43.152 --> 04:45.546
Kids do cruel things
to each other.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.939
But, you know, they bounce back
when you're young.

04:48.026 --> 04:50.290
And I actually think that Reese
is coming around a little bit.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.727
[distant sobbing]

04:55.382 --> 04:57.297
Well, I brought him soup
yesterday,

04:57.384 --> 04:59.473
and he couldn't even
make a sound.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.865
Now, I really...

05:00.952 --> 05:03.651
I really think things are
gonna turn out okay.

05:03.738 --> 05:09.874
Are you trying
to calm me down?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.486
No.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.010
I just don't think

05:15.097 --> 05:18.143
it leads anywhere good
when you get like this.

05:18.230 --> 05:20.581
[quietly]
Get like what?

05:20.668 --> 05:24.280
Well... you know.

05:24.367 --> 05:26.369
No, I don't know.

05:26.456 --> 05:28.284
How is it I get?

05:30.068 --> 05:34.159
-Well...
-If I have a problem,

05:34.246 --> 05:37.467
I would love for you
to explain it to me.

05:41.993 --> 05:43.604
You know what, honey?

05:43.691 --> 05:46.041
This seems
like a-a longer conversation,

05:46.128 --> 05:47.869
and it just so happens

05:47.956 --> 05:49.697
that I am right in the middle
of a project in the garage.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.176
I'm fixing that drawer

05:51.263 --> 05:53.440
from our bathroom cabinet.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.137
You know how
you've always had to keep

05:55.224 --> 05:57.182
your makeup brushes
in the pockets of your robe?

05:57.269 --> 05:59.707
Well, I finally got around
to it, and wouldn't you know,

05:59.794 --> 06:01.230
it's time
for that second gluing.

06:01.317 --> 06:02.797
But if you let it
dry too much,

06:02.884 --> 06:05.495
you might as well make
a bird's nest out of it.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.802
But then I'd have to
sand it and paint it,

06:07.889 --> 06:09.412
and that's a whole
different megillah.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.936
But when I'm done,
we will roll up our sleeves,

06:12.023 --> 06:13.460
and we will get through this.

06:13.547 --> 06:15.636
I mean, if you have
to vent, go ahead.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.116
I am your sounding board.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.945
I don't care if you have
to bite my head off.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.731
It's okay,
it's what I'm here for.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.733
I am your rock.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.822
You've always been there
for me,

06:27.909 --> 06:29.824
and I'll be there for you,

06:29.911 --> 06:32.479
even though physically,
I may be in the garage,

06:32.566 --> 06:33.958
and you in the kitchen.

06:34.045 --> 06:36.744
No matter where I am, I'm there.

06:39.442 --> 06:40.617
I want names.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.097
How many were there?

06:44.360 --> 06:46.667
Good. At least
you can hear me now.

06:46.754 --> 06:49.887
Just nod when you see one.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.803
[whimpering]

06:55.110 --> 06:55.893
Kristin?

06:55.980 --> 06:57.242
[grunts, whimpers]

06:57.329 --> 06:59.506
It's okay.
She can't hurt you now.

07:03.858 --> 07:06.208
-Bye, Kristin.
-Hey, Kris.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.645
[loud chatter]

07:16.697 --> 07:19.439
You just love
that beautiful hair,

07:19.526 --> 07:21.441
don't you, sweetie?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.667
[car approaching]

07:34.410 --> 07:36.456
Damn this drawer!

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
What do you want from me?!

07:48.511 --> 07:51.688
[can clattering]

07:55.387 --> 07:56.519
[clinking]

07:58.129 --> 08:01.219
Oh! And you can kiss
that baby good-bye.

08:01.306 --> 08:03.308
Another walk-off
home run for Hal,

08:03.395 --> 08:05.615
and the crowd is on its feet.

08:05.702 --> 08:06.790
[whooping]

08:06.877 --> 08:08.139
Hal! Hal!

08:08.226 --> 08:10.490
[laughing and whooping]

08:11.882 --> 08:13.536
[crying]

08:18.323 --> 08:20.500
[crying]

08:26.027 --> 08:27.681
I can't take this
anymore, Reese.

08:27.768 --> 08:30.031
You have to stop this
and get on with your life.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.685
[blubbering]

08:32.990 --> 08:34.339
Did I remind you
of your life?

08:42.565 --> 08:44.480
Look, Reese.

08:44.567 --> 08:45.960
It's my ant farm.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.831
I've been raising them
for months.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.530
I know all their names and love
each and every one of them.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.662
Here, have fun.

08:52.749 --> 08:56.100
Why does everything I love
always turn into a pig?

08:56.187 --> 08:57.449
[crying]

09:01.410 --> 09:04.021
Hey, I've got it.
You'll love this.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.720
Today at lunch,
Rick Jensen sat in beef stew.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.765
And then spilled lemonade
on his crotch.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.245
It was a perfect storm.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.594
Kids were coming
from other schools

09:11.681 --> 09:13.204
to laugh at him.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.861
Was he able to get
his pants clean?

09:20.385 --> 09:21.952
Come on, Reese.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.650
You should get back to bed.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.914
I'll bet his mom wasn't able
to get his pants clean.

09:28.872 --> 09:30.657
Hi, Malcolm.
How was school?

09:30.744 --> 09:33.224
Okay, I guess.

09:33.311 --> 09:35.487
Well, there was this
one weird thing.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.055
This girl named Kristin--

09:38.142 --> 09:39.796
she's one of the girls
that picked on Reese.

09:39.883 --> 09:41.711
You're not going to believe
what happened to her.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.888
Oh, my gosh!

09:44.975 --> 09:47.195
Oh, my God! Oh!

09:47.282 --> 09:49.153
My hair! Oh, my God.

09:49.240 --> 09:50.328
[screaming]

09:50.415 --> 09:51.547
Oh, my God!

09:51.634 --> 09:53.897
Who did this?
Who did this?

09:53.984 --> 09:56.421
They tried to get it all out,
but I heard the janitor ended up

09:56.508 --> 09:58.380
having to cut off all her hair
with a hedge trimmer.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.077
Really?

10:00.164 --> 10:01.818
Oh.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.820
That's terrible.

10:03.907 --> 10:06.040
People can be so cruel.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.742
Oh, absolutely.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.223
Ugh! I know, exactly.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.355
No, Kristin
could not stop sobbing.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.706
I'm IMing her right now.
She's a complete wreck.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.230
I know. Did you see her
without her hair?

10:22.317 --> 10:23.971
[laughs]

10:24.058 --> 10:25.581
You know, I never realized
she had such a tiny head.

10:25.668 --> 10:27.365
Oh, but you know
what the best part is?

10:27.452 --> 10:29.324
Now Dylan's available.

10:29.411 --> 10:32.066
Does he?
No. Get out!

10:34.024 --> 10:35.896
[laughing]

10:39.160 --> 10:41.597
Okay, rookie,
show me what you got.

10:49.431 --> 10:53.478
Okay, at least we know
you're not on steroids.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.617
[crowd chatter]

11:01.704 --> 11:03.750
Mom, what are you doing here?

11:03.837 --> 11:05.490
I'm here to pick up
some things for Reese.

11:05.577 --> 11:07.797
You know, so he can catch
up on his schoolwork.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.103
I hope you rented a truck.

11:09.190 --> 11:10.757
You know what?

11:10.844 --> 11:12.367
Everyone seems very amused
by your brother's pain.

11:12.454 --> 11:14.804
Well, I think people better
start thinking twice.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.812
Oh, my God!

11:22.899 --> 11:24.901
Who did this?

11:27.469 --> 11:29.645
Moppet?!

11:29.732 --> 11:30.820
Baby?!

11:33.040 --> 11:36.086
[gasps]
No!

11:36.173 --> 11:38.436
[sobbing]

11:39.568 --> 11:40.612
It's you!

11:49.143 --> 11:51.885
There you are.

11:51.972 --> 11:53.756
You took off
so fast from school,

11:53.843 --> 11:55.192
we didn't get
a chance to talk

11:55.279 --> 11:56.672
about what happened
to Diane.

11:56.759 --> 11:58.021
I'm a very busy woman,
Malcolm.

11:58.108 --> 11:59.327
It isn't easy
running this household.

11:59.414 --> 12:02.112
I can imagine--
cooking, shopping,

12:02.199 --> 12:03.810
cutting the heads
off of dolls.

12:03.897 --> 12:05.550
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

12:05.637 --> 12:08.466
Come on, Mom, it's pretty
obvious what's going on here,

12:08.553 --> 12:09.511
and I think it's sick!

12:09.598 --> 12:10.817
Did you see
Diane's reaction?

12:10.904 --> 12:12.688
No, I didn't.
Was she crying?

12:12.775 --> 12:14.211
She had to be
wrapped in a blanket

12:14.298 --> 12:15.996
and carried to
the school nurse's office.

12:16.083 --> 12:17.475
Terrible, just terrible.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.521
There's a salad
in the fridge

12:19.608 --> 12:20.827
and you boys can make
yourselves sloppy Joe's

12:20.914 --> 12:22.002
whenever you're hungry.

12:22.089 --> 12:23.220
I've got
some errands to run.

12:23.307 --> 12:24.744
Oh, "errands," right?

12:24.831 --> 12:26.006
I know what you're
up to, Mom.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.398
Oh, yes, Malcolm,
you've caught me.

12:27.485 --> 12:28.791
I've got to return
an overdue video,

12:28.878 --> 12:30.314
go to the cleaners,

12:30.401 --> 12:31.663
and pick up milk and
cereal for the morning.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.622
-Guilty as charged.
-Oh, nice try.

12:33.709 --> 12:36.103
Now, I want you
to look me in the eye and...

12:36.190 --> 12:38.018
Mom, I know you're behind all
this, and sooner or later

12:38.105 --> 12:39.889
you're going to have
to talk to me.

12:39.976 --> 12:41.804
LOIS: Oh, for God's sake,
Malcolm, can't I have
a moment's rest?

12:41.891 --> 12:43.545
No, you can't!

12:43.632 --> 12:46.504
Tell me, did it feel good
to cut through Elmo's neck?

12:46.591 --> 12:47.592
Did it?!

12:47.679 --> 12:49.464
Mom?

12:49.551 --> 12:52.075
Mom?

12:55.470 --> 12:57.864
Runners on second and third,
with two outs.

12:57.951 --> 12:59.822
Here's the wind-up,
and the pitch.

13:01.911 --> 13:03.565
You know, it's a shame
to see some of these veterans

13:03.652 --> 13:05.175
hang on a little too long.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.960
Oh, sure, they were great once,

13:07.047 --> 13:08.135
but there comes a point

13:08.222 --> 13:10.311
when you just have to say

13:10.398 --> 13:12.748
"I'm done," and hang them up.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.358
Dad, you've got
to do something.

13:14.445 --> 13:15.838
Mom has been
stalking those girls

13:15.925 --> 13:17.797
who humiliated Reese like
some kind of vigilante.

13:17.884 --> 13:19.711
What? Are you sure
about this?

13:19.799 --> 13:21.452
Yes. She's nailed
two of them so far,

13:21.539 --> 13:23.759
and she just climbed out
of the bathroom window

13:23.846 --> 13:25.152
to go get the third.

13:25.239 --> 13:29.069
This sounds like a lot
of supposition, Malcolm.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.548
I mean, it would be
a different story

13:30.635 --> 13:34.770
if you had hard evidence
or an eyewitness.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.163
I saw her at
school today.

13:36.250 --> 13:37.991
She was there when these
butchered dolls' heads

13:38.078 --> 13:39.949
rolled out of one of
the girls' lockers.

13:40.036 --> 13:43.039
And what exactly do you mean
when you say you were "there"?

13:43.126 --> 13:44.824
Dad, stop it--
don't you care?

13:44.911 --> 13:46.303
Of course, I care,

13:46.390 --> 13:47.609
But I think
what we need right now

13:47.696 --> 13:50.873
is caution and prudence.

13:50.960 --> 13:54.007
A proactive wait-and-see,
if you will.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.356
So you're not going
to do anything?

13:55.443 --> 13:56.661
Listen, when your mother
gets like this,

13:56.748 --> 13:58.141
we need to vigilantly
keep abreast

13:58.228 --> 14:00.013
of all the developments
in a fully-engaged

14:00.100 --> 14:01.666
yet cautiously detached--

14:01.753 --> 14:03.451
Oh, forget it-- if you're
not going to help me,

14:03.538 --> 14:04.495
then I'll just
stop her myself,

14:04.582 --> 14:05.888
and you can stay here

14:05.975 --> 14:07.237
and play your
ridiculous little game.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.152
Good.

14:09.239 --> 14:11.241
Sorry for the delay, folks.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.764
There was a fan on the field.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.462
Now let's see
if this bonus baby

14:14.549 --> 14:16.899
is really worth all the money
that they paid for him.

14:18.466 --> 14:21.077
[shrieks]

14:21.164 --> 14:23.253
Oh!

14:23.340 --> 14:24.646
Oh, my God,
that could've killed...

14:24.733 --> 14:26.213
[screams]

14:27.954 --> 14:29.346
You wouldn't believe
the homework

14:29.433 --> 14:30.913
Mr. Hendricks has been
dumping on us lately.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.741
Lift your arm.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.874
I mean, okay,
your wife moved out.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.223
Don't take it out on us.

14:36.310 --> 14:37.789
If his behavior with her

14:37.877 --> 14:39.922
is anything like it is
in math class, I totally get it.

14:40.009 --> 14:42.490
Hey, how is he doing?

14:42.577 --> 14:45.319
He's having
a very good day.

15:12.302 --> 15:14.565
[phone ringing]

15:14.652 --> 15:15.784
Hello?

15:15.871 --> 15:16.872
LOIS: Hello.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.613
This is the Edgewood Hotel.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.528
I'm calling to verify a room

15:20.615 --> 15:22.356
with a queen-sized bed
for tonight.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.835
I'm sorry, there must be
some mistake.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.185
Oh?

15:25.272 --> 15:28.057
The reservation was made
by Heidi Kaczenski.

15:28.144 --> 15:30.712
She also requested
a bottle of champagne

15:30.799 --> 15:32.496
and the romance package.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.498
I think you'd better cancel
that reservation.

15:34.585 --> 15:37.371
Heidi! Get in here
this minute!

15:37.458 --> 15:39.503
Dad, what is so important? I...

15:39.590 --> 15:41.462
You and Scott got
a hotel room for tonight?

15:41.549 --> 15:42.724
What?!

15:42.811 --> 15:44.117
That was the hotel calling.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.074
MOTHER:
How could you do this to us?!

15:45.161 --> 15:46.423
I didn't
do anything.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.903
I was in my room getting
ready for the dance.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.035
You really don't know
anything about this?

15:49.122 --> 15:50.645
No!

15:50.732 --> 15:52.952
What's this?

15:54.257 --> 15:55.171
Oh, my God!

15:55.258 --> 15:57.347
That is not mine!

15:57.434 --> 15:59.219
FATHER:
I don't know what the
hell you were thinking,

15:59.306 --> 16:01.743
but as of right now,
you and Scott are through!

16:01.830 --> 16:02.831
[grunts]
I hate you!

16:02.918 --> 16:04.398
I hate both of you!

16:04.485 --> 16:05.616
[groans]

16:10.665 --> 16:11.796
[pot breaking]

16:11.883 --> 16:12.972
I saw something move.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.496
There's somebody out there.

16:19.456 --> 16:20.457
[gasps]

16:26.115 --> 16:27.377
What's going on out here?

16:29.379 --> 16:31.207
I'll tell you what's going on.

16:31.294 --> 16:32.817
I saw this punk peeking
in your window.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.080
What?!

16:34.167 --> 16:35.472
I can't believe this!

16:35.559 --> 16:36.821
Jordan, I thought
you were a good kid!

16:36.908 --> 16:38.867
But I was...

16:38.954 --> 16:40.347
You picked the wrong
night to mess with me,
you little perv!

16:40.434 --> 16:41.739
Let's see
what the police

16:41.826 --> 16:43.480
have to say about this.

16:55.144 --> 16:57.668
I need to talk to you.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.061
Not now.

16:59.148 --> 17:01.020
Please, I need
to tell you something.

17:03.544 --> 17:05.981
I've been a terrible mother.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.417
It's okay, Mom.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.768
I've known that for a long time.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.422
No, you don't understand.

17:12.509 --> 17:14.945
When those girls humiliated you,

17:15.034 --> 17:16.905
instead of trying to comfort you

17:16.992 --> 17:18.340
and help you deal
with your feelings,

17:18.428 --> 17:20.300
I just got caught up
in my own anger

17:20.387 --> 17:22.911
and went on a rampage.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.827
What?

17:25.914 --> 17:27.829
All I was worried about
was making them pay,

17:27.915 --> 17:29.352
and they did.

17:29.439 --> 17:31.746
But what disturbs me is

17:31.833 --> 17:33.965
how much I enjoyed
crushing those three girls

17:34.053 --> 17:35.837
and watching them suffer.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.447
I tapped into some dark,

17:37.534 --> 17:39.362
ugly place inside of me.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.800
I was acting like...

17:42.887 --> 17:44.672
you.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.674
[chuckles lightly]
Oh, God, who am I kidding?

17:46.761 --> 17:49.242
I wasn't acting like you.

17:53.550 --> 17:54.986
I am you.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.774
There's this horrible thing
that's part of us

17:59.861 --> 18:04.039
that makes it seem okay
to do really scary stuff.

18:04.126 --> 18:05.475
I must have gotten it
from Grandma,

18:05.562 --> 18:07.477
and I passed it on
to you, sweetie.

18:07.564 --> 18:11.220
And all
I can say is...

18:11.307 --> 18:13.135
I'm sorry.

18:15.311 --> 18:18.358
I'm deeply, deeply sorry.

18:18.445 --> 18:21.361
There's one left?

18:21.448 --> 18:24.799
No, Reese...

18:24.886 --> 18:27.541
that doesn't matter.

18:27.628 --> 18:29.412
Yeah, yeah, I know that, Mom.

18:29.499 --> 18:31.588
I'm just trying
to let it sink in.

18:38.421 --> 18:40.162
You know, that girl
will be getting away with it.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.816
She doesn't matter.

18:41.903 --> 18:43.513
What matters is us.

18:43.600 --> 18:46.821
I get that stuff about us, Mom.
That was amazing.

18:46.908 --> 18:49.128
I was just thinking about what
must be going through her head.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.914
But you're right,
it's not about her.

18:53.001 --> 18:55.612
Exactly.

18:57.397 --> 19:00.443
What do you mean what's
going on inside of her head?

19:00.530 --> 19:03.098
You know, how she
thinks she beat you.

19:03.185 --> 19:04.839
"I'm perfect
and I got away with it,

19:04.926 --> 19:06.754
"and that tired, frumpy
housewife just didn't have

19:06.841 --> 19:08.495
what it took
to finish the job."

19:11.933 --> 19:13.239
If you think you're
manipulating me,

19:13.326 --> 19:14.675
you're wrong.

19:14.762 --> 19:16.590
That girl just needs to
know she can't go around

19:16.677 --> 19:18.374
hurting people without there
being consequences.

19:18.461 --> 19:19.636
And that way,
she'll grow up

19:19.723 --> 19:20.985
to be a very
nice young lady.

19:21.072 --> 19:22.552
-Got it.
-And I want

19:22.639 --> 19:24.380
to make it clear that this
is a one-time thing,

19:24.467 --> 19:25.686
due to very special
circumstances.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.427
-Understood.
-Now get back there

19:27.514 --> 19:29.516
and fill up those
balloons with paint.

19:29.603 --> 19:31.257
I'll tell you what, Joe.

19:31.344 --> 19:34.260
The idea that man came
from an ape still rankles me.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.739
I say prove it.

19:35.826 --> 19:37.567
Point well taken, Skip,
but the good news

19:37.654 --> 19:39.613
here at the ballpark
is that the rain delay

19:39.700 --> 19:42.572
is finally over, and we can get
back to playing America's...

19:47.229 --> 19:48.709
I think we have enough.

19:48.796 --> 19:49.927
Let's move.

19:51.233 --> 19:52.539
I knew
I'd find you here!

19:52.626 --> 19:54.323
Well, congratulations, Columbo.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.672
Now, move, we're in a hurry.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.327
Mom, no!
What you're doing is crazy.

19:58.414 --> 20:00.286
It goes against everything
you've ever taught us.

20:00.373 --> 20:02.113
You don't get it, Malcolm.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.333
This is a one-time thing due
to very special circumstances.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.989
-Tell him, Mom.
-Get out of our way!

20:08.076 --> 20:10.818
This is not going to happen.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.039
You look gorgeous.

20:15.126 --> 20:16.563
They're moving--
adjust left.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.565
Adjusting left.

20:22.395 --> 20:23.787
Direct hit.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.789
Oh, my dress!

20:25.876 --> 20:27.008
[screams]

20:27.095 --> 20:28.966
Stop it!

20:29.053 --> 20:30.403
[girl screaming]

20:30.490 --> 20:34.537
Somebody make them stop!

20:34.624 --> 20:36.409
[screams]

20:36.496 --> 20:38.889
What are you doing?
Let go of me, you coward!

20:38.976 --> 20:40.413
[screams]
Stop it!

20:40.500 --> 20:44.286
[sobbing]

20:44.373 --> 20:45.635
This is nice.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.984
Just the two of us.

20:47.071 --> 20:49.596
I was just thinking
the same thing.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.206
[machine pitches]

20:52.729 --> 20:55.166
Stop it!

20:55.254 --> 20:57.081
Stop!

20:57.168 --> 20:58.953
It's a shame
it was over so quickly.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.520
I know.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.738
Maybe we can go bowling
together some time.

21:01.825 --> 21:03.262
I'd like that.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.351
MALCOLM: Unbelievable.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.831
So as long as you can
rationalize your behavior,

21:07.918 --> 21:09.659
I guess you can do
whatever you want.

21:09.746 --> 21:12.009
There are no rules, huh, Mom?
Is that what you're saying?

21:12.096 --> 21:13.446
Oh, Malcolm,
for Pete's sake.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.838
Don't be so upset.

21:14.925 --> 21:18.320
I'll do something
with you next week.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.926
