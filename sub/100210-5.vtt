I can help you
like that.

07:45.361 --> 07:47.432
Oh, I don't have the grades
to be a rug doctor.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.261
When you were having
trouble pinning Karl,

07:49.296 --> 07:51.160
was it him
you were wrestling with,

07:51.194 --> 07:52.920
or was it "inner Ronnie"?

07:52.955 --> 07:54.404
Inner Ronnie?

07:54.439 --> 07:55.578
Knock, knock.

07:55.613 --> 07:57.753
Can "inner Ronnie" tell me
what's on his mind?

07:57.787 --> 08:00.169
Well, I guess we're both
kinda bummed
about my grandma.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.515
She practically raised me.

08:01.550 --> 08:02.620
Coach is listening.

08:02.654 --> 08:04.276
Well, she's got
this new boyfriend, Hank,

08:04.311 --> 08:06.520
and he's never gonna
be my grandpa.

08:06.555 --> 08:08.971
No matter how many
50-cent pieces
he pulls out of my ear.

08:09.005 --> 08:10.524
I think you know
what you'll have to do

08:10.559 --> 08:12.008
before you're ready
to wrestle Karl.

08:12.043 --> 08:13.389
Wrestle Hank.

08:13.423 --> 08:16.944
No. You need to open up
to Hank and your granny,

08:16.979 --> 08:19.982
and this time,
let "inner Ronnie"
do the talking.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.190
Oh, thanks.

08:21.224 --> 08:22.640
Yeah.
I'm on it.

08:22.674 --> 08:24.296
That's good coaching, Coach.

08:24.331 --> 08:25.643
Thanks, Weasel.

08:25.677 --> 08:28.059
What the hell kind of
cockamamie practice is this?

08:28.093 --> 08:29.543
Why is there no sweat
on the mat?

08:29.578 --> 08:30.820
Why is nobody wrestling?

08:30.855 --> 08:33.167
Where's that
musty armpit smell?

08:33.202 --> 08:35.687
Rick, you should be
home in bed.
You look terrible.

08:35.722 --> 08:39.449
I feel terrible, too.
Got my temperature
up to 104.8.

08:39.484 --> 08:41.106
That's a personal best.

08:41.141 --> 08:42.729
I stopped sweating
'cause I'm all out.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.317
Where's Ronnie,
my best wrestler?

08:45.352 --> 08:46.940
I sent him home
for some training.

08:46.974 --> 08:49.563
Weights?
Yes. Emotional ones.

08:49.598 --> 08:50.944
And those are
the heaviest of all.

08:50.978 --> 08:52.083
No, they're not.

08:52.117 --> 08:54.119
Emotions and feelings
don't mix with wrestling.

08:54.154 --> 08:55.362
I knew
you'd botch this up.

08:55.396 --> 08:57.398
I was actually making
some real progress here.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.297
By sending Ronnie home
to cry in his journal?

08:59.331 --> 09:01.230
Journaling
would be a huge step.

09:01.264 --> 09:04.682
I need to coach
this team to victory
over Valley Forge!

09:04.716 --> 09:07.270
Whoa. Okay. Come on.
We're taking you
to the emergency room.

09:07.305 --> 09:08.686
Huh? No way.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.998
Not until you promise
to call your colonel pal

09:11.033 --> 09:13.380
and tell him to postpone
this meet until I'm better

09:13.414 --> 09:15.244
and I can undo
all the coaching you did.

09:15.278 --> 09:16.832
If that's what
it takes, fine.

09:16.866 --> 09:19.455
I will call Colonel Welch
and postpone.
Now let's go.

when he's better. Hell, no!

to postpone
the wrestling meet,

09:38.232 --> 09:39.924
Glascott had to break
the news to Coach.

really sick, but recovering
in his own way.

What's up, pal?!

09:46.724 --> 09:47.897
Rick, shouldn't you
be in bed?

09:47.932 --> 09:49.554
There's no stopping
the Mellor machine.

09:49.589 --> 09:52.246
My mind is moving in a million
different directions.

09:53.765 --> 09:56.906
I just got an idea
for a Police Academymovie.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.668
I need a pen and some paper.

09:59.702 --> 10:01.462
So, listen, I was talking
to Colonel Welch

10:01.497 --> 10:02.878

10:02.912 --> 10:05.915
Valley Forge.
Pivotal moment in the war.

about postponing
the wrestling match,

10:14.993 --> 10:16.754

Mmm.

10:25.279 --> 10:27.109

Don't worry, Rick.

diving into his trademark

Silly costumes,
baggy cargo pants,

11:04.318 --> 11:07.805
We had
a trombone/bass-drum collision
during band practice.

11:07.839 --> 11:09.565
Looks like
the trombone won.

So sorry.

that gluing felt numbers
