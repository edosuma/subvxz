WEBVTT

00:03.568 --> 00:06.006
All right, honey,
five weeks on this remodel,

00:06.049 --> 00:07.746
and it is finally done.

00:07.790 --> 00:09.139
What do you think?

00:09.183 --> 00:11.272
Oh, this is the most
beautiful drawing...

00:11.315 --> 00:13.274
-Blueprint.
-...blueprint...

00:13.317 --> 00:15.015
-of a ba...
-Restaurant.

00:15.058 --> 00:17.452
...restaurant.

00:17.495 --> 00:19.410
I'’m sorry, babe,
I am exhausted, all right?

00:19.454 --> 00:20.933
This week'’s been brutal.

00:20.977 --> 00:23.588
It'’s the first half
of the third financial quarter,

00:23.632 --> 00:26.069
or, as we accountants call it,
"the big dance."

00:26.113 --> 00:28.289
Uh-huh. Yeah, that'’s probably
'’cause none of you guys

00:28.332 --> 00:30.378
were ever invited
to actual dances.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.423
Aw, I miss
my little house bully.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.339
Been working so much,
I feel like

00:35.383 --> 00:36.471
I haven'’t seen you in weeks.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.647
I know. And we
only have one more night

00:38.690 --> 00:40.518
with the house to ourselves
until Cooper'’s back

00:40.562 --> 00:41.606
from writing his new album.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.391
Ah. So...

00:43.434 --> 00:45.219
what do you say we, uh,

00:45.262 --> 00:48.439
go upstairs and get undressed,

00:48.483 --> 00:50.572
get into bed and, uh...

00:50.615 --> 00:52.574
split this sleeping pill?

00:52.617 --> 00:55.533
Oh, my God,
you'’re the best husband ever.

00:55.577 --> 00:57.840
[laughs]
Where'’d you get that?

00:57.883 --> 01:01.409
Tina from HR, which I believe
stands for Hella Rested.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.672
[grunts]
Yes. Oh, man.

01:03.715 --> 01:07.328
Ah, yeah, that'’s pure, that's...

01:07.371 --> 01:09.069
Hey, wait, you think
it'’s okay for us

01:09.112 --> 01:10.505
to take someone else'’s
prescription?

01:10.548 --> 01:13.073
Who'’s gonna bust us,
the dream police?

01:13.116 --> 01:14.770
-[siren blares]
-Oh, my God, it'’s the cops!

01:14.813 --> 01:16.119
Don'’t panic.
Don'’t panic. Okay, uh...

01:16.163 --> 01:18.600
Jake! Jake, relax.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.471
-Relax. Right. Just chill.
-[knocking]

01:21.516 --> 01:24.127
Just chill, man.

01:24.171 --> 01:26.042
-Chill, baby.
-Just answer the door.

01:27.174 --> 01:30.002
Are you Jake and Claire Davis?

01:30.046 --> 01:32.527
It was Claire!
And the drugs are in the plant!

01:34.703 --> 01:36.618
Yes.

01:36.661 --> 01:39.708
I remember now.
This isour daughter'’s home.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.144
Thank you, Officer.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.364
I found these two
wandering around the marina.

01:43.407 --> 01:45.366
Same thing happened
to my parents.

01:45.409 --> 01:48.325
Make the most
of their lucid moments.

01:48.369 --> 01:49.761
[door closes]

01:49.805 --> 01:51.763
-He'’s gone.
-[sighs]: Oh.

01:51.807 --> 01:54.114
Oh, it is so hard
being fake senile.

01:54.157 --> 01:55.941
when you'’re real drunk.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.683
Uh, what is going on?

01:58.727 --> 02:01.121
And... why do you two smell
like an old rug

02:01.164 --> 02:03.427
in a frat house basement?

02:03.471 --> 02:06.038
We were out on a boat playing
flip cup with our new friends

02:06.082 --> 02:08.345
from the yacht club,
and got way too hosed to drive,

02:08.389 --> 02:10.173
so we called the cops
for a ride.

02:10.217 --> 02:13.829
That'’s your actual answer?
It sounds like

02:13.872 --> 02:16.440
you'’re quoting a line
from Kid Rock'’s deposition.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.705
Yeah, cops don'’t
just give people rides.

02:20.749 --> 02:23.230
It turns out, at our age,
if you just act confused,

02:23.273 --> 02:25.014
the police
will drive you anywhere.

02:25.057 --> 02:27.408
They'’re like free Uber.

02:27.451 --> 02:29.236
Mom!

02:29.279 --> 02:31.455
Oh, come on, you know?
I pay my taxes.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.501
Well, not this year,
but sometimes.

02:33.544 --> 02:36.895
We shared the back seat with
the most charming shoplifter.

02:36.939 --> 02:38.810
He said the key to stealing

02:38.854 --> 02:42.466
was to work as a team
and have the lookout distracting

02:42.510 --> 02:44.251
-the marks.

02:46.862 --> 02:47.732
[exhales]

02:51.736 --> 02:55.131
So, who are these new
yacht club friends, anyway?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.742
Oh, we'’ve told you
about Terry and the Gooch.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.485
Terry and the Gooch?

03:01.529 --> 03:05.228
Sounds like a Pixar movie
about STDs.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.667
They are a hoot.

03:09.711 --> 03:12.061
They took us skinny-dipping.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.932
-Oh, no way.
-Yeah. You want to see photos?

03:13.976 --> 03:16.021
No way.

03:16.065 --> 03:18.067
Why'’d you two stop hanging out
with your old friends,

03:18.110 --> 03:19.199
-like the Johnstons?
-GERALD: Ugh!

03:19.242 --> 03:21.331
You mean the Yawnstons?

03:21.375 --> 03:24.160
They are the absolute worst.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.032
Life is just too short
to hang out with lame people.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.686
And speaking of, let'’s bounce.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.471
Great.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.473
Mom, what'’s in your purse?

03:32.516 --> 03:34.953
Oh. Just a little bit
of none-ya.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.173
-None-ya what?
-Claire, don'’t...

I barely slept last night.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.728
Really? I didn'’t notice during
your nine consecutive hours

04:10.772 --> 04:12.426
of...
[grunting]

04:16.995 --> 04:18.736
I'’m sorry.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.521
But our lives are
stressful enough

04:20.564 --> 04:22.610
without my parents
acting all crazy.

04:22.653 --> 04:25.047
And I just wish that
they would text me back.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.179
I mean, who even knows
if they got home last night?

04:27.223 --> 04:29.834
I mean, I'’d offer to go check
on them, but, uh, too scared

04:29.878 --> 04:32.837
to walk in and find out why they
have a leash and no dog.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.013
They used to be so reliable.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.537
But ever since they retired,

04:36.580 --> 04:38.930
they'’re acting like
a couple of teenagers.

04:38.974 --> 04:40.889
They'’re partying all the time,
stealing our liquor,

04:40.932 --> 04:43.065
getting brought home
in cop cars.

04:43.108 --> 04:45.328
I mean, what if next time
it'’s a doctor car?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.634
You mean an ambulance?

04:47.765 --> 04:50.072
I'’m just so tired, Jake.

04:50.115 --> 04:52.030
Look, listen, babe, look, look,
if you'’re really worried,

04:52.074 --> 04:54.250
then maybe we should talk
to them, you know?

04:54.294 --> 04:56.470
I'’ve been practicing my dad
voice for when we have kids.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.602
Don'’t you walk away from me!

04:58.646 --> 05:01.039
I will turn this car around!

05:01.083 --> 05:03.433
You'’re in good hands!
Nope. Lost it. I went Allstate.

05:03.477 --> 05:05.914
Honestly, I don'’t think
that'’ll work anyway,

05:05.957 --> 05:07.785
'’cause whenever my parents
used to yell at me,

05:07.829 --> 05:09.439
it just made me rebel more.

05:09.483 --> 05:12.181
That'’s why I ended up dating
so many bad boys.

05:12.224 --> 05:15.489
I wouldn'’t call myself
a badboy.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.535
[laughs]:
Nobody would.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.972
Anyway, my clients are visiting
the site on Monday,

05:21.016 --> 05:23.323
-so I got to crank
on this restaurant plan.
-Sounds good.

05:23.366 --> 05:26.326
Let'’s get some work done while
we have the house to ourselves.

05:26.369 --> 05:28.371
Guys, stop everything.

05:28.415 --> 05:31.200
Cooper has an emergency,
and it'’s more important

05:31.243 --> 05:33.420
than whatever you'’re doing,
because he'’s famous.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.510
What is it?

05:36.553 --> 05:38.381
My label'’s on me
to record a big hit

05:38.425 --> 05:39.904
for this summer,
but I have nothing.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.471
That'’s why I dug out
some old records,

05:41.515 --> 05:42.777
to help him find inspiration.

05:42.820 --> 05:44.735
Now, this is the entire
soundtrack of my youth.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.171
You can pull out any album

05:46.215 --> 05:48.130
and there is
a crystal clear memory attached.

05:48.173 --> 05:51.220
Got it. Uh, what about Blondie,
Parallel Lines?

05:51.263 --> 05:53.091
Summer of '’78,
oiled up and sunbathing

05:53.135 --> 05:56.356
on the roof of my mother'’s car.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.880
I can'’t tell you how many times
she drove to the store

05:58.923 --> 06:01.883
not realizing I was up there.

06:01.926 --> 06:03.188
Uh, Wayne,
you'’re Cooper's manager.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.625
I hope you'’re not suggesting

06:04.668 --> 06:06.061
he rip off someone else'’s music.

06:06.104 --> 06:07.889
What?! No.

06:07.932 --> 06:09.717
I'’m suggesting he pay tribute.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.458
Like, uh, to the Eagles.

06:11.501 --> 06:14.852
Perhaps a song called
"Hotel Colorado."

06:14.896 --> 06:17.551
Problem is I don'’t have anything
exciting to write about.

06:17.594 --> 06:19.770
When my ex-girlfriend Sierra
faked her own death,

06:19.814 --> 06:21.990
the songs just poured out of me.

06:22.033 --> 06:26.560
Well, we can'’t kill Sierra.
The cops frown on it.

06:26.603 --> 06:28.692
COOPER: Claire, Jake,
don'’t get me wrong,

06:28.736 --> 06:30.781
I'’ve never been happier--
it'’s just that

06:30.825 --> 06:32.870
-living with you guys is so...
-Boring?

06:32.914 --> 06:35.220
Depressing? Lonely?

06:35.264 --> 06:37.092
There I go again,
describing my childhood.

06:37.135 --> 06:37.788
[chuckles]

06:39.834 --> 06:41.792
I was gonna say normal.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.447
Um, which is what I love
about being here,

06:44.491 --> 06:46.275
but it doesn'’t
exactly make for...

06:46.318 --> 06:48.146
exciting music.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.321
What?

06:49.365 --> 06:51.367
What?!

06:51.411 --> 06:54.326
[laughs]: Listen, man, if you
want an exciting summer anthem,

06:54.370 --> 06:56.590
Claire and I can help you out.

06:56.633 --> 06:58.679
Yeah. You know what?

19:07.450 --> 19:10.627
Okay, well,
I guess the two of us

19:10.671 --> 19:13.195
are gonna go back home
and go to sleep.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.936

Oh, yeah.

19:25.729 --> 19:29.342
All right, I have written a song
for "Till Death Do We Party,"

19:29.385 --> 19:31.605
and I would love to get
your honest opinion.

19:31.648 --> 19:33.041
Yeah, all right.All right.
Right on.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.830
Hey, this is actually good.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.704
I didn'’t mean to hit
"actually" so hard.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.227
I'’m feeling the bass line, man.Yeah?

19:45.271 --> 19:46.620
It'’s nice. Yeah.Yeah.

19:52.800 --> 19:53.931
I'’m kind of loving those

19:53.975 --> 19:55.977
sexy moaning sounds
in the background.

19:56.020 --> 19:56.760

Sick burn, man.
Crushed her.

20:01.504 --> 20:02.375
That actually is Bonnie, though.

20:04.377 --> 20:05.508
What'’s that, now?

20:05.552 --> 20:06.988
Yeah, when we were
recording the track,

20:07.031 --> 20:07.945
she was in the studio
and just happened

20:07.989 --> 20:09.469
to be making those noises,

20:09.512 --> 20:11.122
so my producer said,
"Let'’s just lay it in

20:11.166 --> 20:13.647
if we can'’t get her to stop."

20:13.690 --> 20:15.518
Please tell me you'’re joking.

20:15.562 --> 20:17.259
It'’s great, right?
And those, uh,

to me, baby..."
