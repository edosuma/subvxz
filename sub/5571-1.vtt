WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:04.770
Nobody move!
(Echoes): No!

00:04.772 --> 00:06.305
(Explosion)

00:06.307 --> 00:09.141
NCIS cyber linked
Bradley simek's communications

00:09.143 --> 00:11.243
to a specific
terror cell, the calling.

00:11.245 --> 00:13.379
We've sent you background
on a calling leader in France.

00:13.381 --> 00:16.248
His name is Matthew Rousseau.

00:16.250 --> 00:18.417
I know nothing
about any s-mines.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.519
Dorneget, listen to me,
there's a threat to the hotel.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.321
They know you're there. You need
to get everyone out of there.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.256
Everybody out! Go!

00:25.393 --> 00:28.193
Bishop:
<i>Gibbs, dorneget didn't make it.</i>

00:28.195 --> 00:30.262
Vance:
CIA officer
Joanna teague,

00:30.264 --> 00:31.697
agent dorneget's
mother.

00:31.698 --> 00:33.131
The calling
is making a strong push

00:33.134 --> 00:34.366
to recruit children.

00:34.368 --> 00:35.601
Luke Harris,
right?

00:35.603 --> 00:37.136
I don't know what to do anymore.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.371
You talk to me.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.605
Everyone hates me! Just kill me!

00:39.607 --> 00:40.773
That's what
they want!

00:40.775 --> 00:42.307
The supreme court justices.

00:42.309 --> 00:44.209
Where are they?
A compound in the appalachians.

00:44.211 --> 00:45.077
Well, get it on lockdown.

00:45.079 --> 00:46.145
Bishop:
Who's Daniel budd?

00:46.147 --> 00:47.246
The leader of the calling.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.081
Welcome to Iraq, agent DiNozzo.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.082
Is this Daniel?

00:50.084 --> 00:52.751
The boy, Luke,

00:52.753 --> 00:55.087
I'm sorry for being the bearer
of bad news, but...

00:55.089 --> 00:56.622
Luke:
Agent Gibbs?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.391
(People screaming)

01:01.262 --> 01:02.394
(Shouts)

01:14.842 --> 01:16.375
Tony:
Boss, just hang in there.

01:16.377 --> 01:17.609
Keep breathing. Deep breaths.

01:17.611 --> 01:18.677
You're gonna
be all right.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.779
NCIS agent
with two gsws,

01:20.781 --> 01:22.414
one to the chest,
one to the knee.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.384
Franks:
I told you, probie.

01:25.386 --> 01:27.252
It's all different now.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.254
You trusted the boy...

01:29.256 --> 01:31.390
And look what he did to you.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.859
BP's at 160/95.
Rate is 110.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.394
Pulse ox is at 94%.

01:35.396 --> 01:37.663
Franks:
Kid caught us flying blind.

01:37.665 --> 01:39.698
Never saw it coming.

01:39.700 --> 01:42.201
Maybe that says something
about us.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.636
Boss, can you hear me?
Actually,
that's my line.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.405
And I think you're in my seat.

01:46.407 --> 01:49.241
Agent Gibbs, I am Dr. taft.

01:49.243 --> 01:52.711
Welcome to the USS<i> Daniel</i>
<i> Webster</i> surgical ward,

01:52.713 --> 01:54.813
where the elite
beat the desert heat

01:54.815 --> 01:57.349
and cheat the occasional ied.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.384
Now, agent Gibbs, do you
understand what I'm saying?

01:59.386 --> 02:01.420
Can you hear me?

02:01.422 --> 02:03.489
Okay, give me
three more units of o-neg, uh,

02:03.491 --> 02:06.492
run a cbc, chem seven, and
i want a ct scan of the chest

02:06.494 --> 02:09.628
and the leg, keep the morphine
coming, and can somebody please

02:09.630 --> 02:12.598
let Dr. winthrop know that
I've requested his company?

02:12.600 --> 02:15.434
Got us a lovely table
overlooking agent Gibbs' aorta.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.903
Doc, is he gonna be all right?
How does it look?

02:17.905 --> 02:20.572
He's lucky he has
friends who care.

02:20.574 --> 02:23.342
He's luckier that I care. Go.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.910
Let us work.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.912
Tony, come on.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.181
(Talking indistinctly)

03:00.181 --> 03:02.247
Tony, Tony, slow down.
One thing at a time.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.383
That's great. Okay.

03:04.385 --> 03:06.385
I'll let everyone here know.
Thanks.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.887
Know what? Where are we, bishop?

03:08.889 --> 03:11.523
Homeland confirms
the supreme court justices

03:11.525 --> 03:13.692
were safely evacuated
from their retreat.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.460
And the calling's bomb threat?

03:15.462 --> 03:16.862
All too real, director.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.864
Three bouncing Bettys
found at the site

03:18.866 --> 03:20.732
were defused or detonated
by the bomb squad.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.201
What about Gibbs?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.302
McGee's on with Tony right now.

03:24.238 --> 03:26.405
What happened? Is it true?

03:26.407 --> 03:27.706
Is agent Gibbs
really hurt?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.541
All right.
I'll-I'll call you back.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.210
Okay, get back to him.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.345
Hang in there.

03:33.347 --> 03:34.446
Get back to who?
Get back to Gibbs?

03:34.448 --> 03:36.215
S-so Tony's with him?

03:36.217 --> 03:38.283
Gibbs was shot.

03:38.285 --> 03:41.253
Shot?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.855
Twice.
At point-blank range.

03:43.857 --> 03:45.557
By Luke Harris.

03:45.559 --> 03:46.925
They're prepping him
for surgery.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.560
Luke Harris?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.529
That-that kid?

03:50.531 --> 03:52.497
Yeah, the one
that Gibbs was helping.

03:52.499 --> 03:54.900
Any word on Daniel budd,
agent McGee?

03:54.902 --> 03:57.769
He's still in Iraq,
still at large.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.404
Details
are sketchy.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.405
Ducky:
And Jethro?

04:00.407 --> 04:02.441
What's his condition?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.612
For what it's worth,
agent Gibbs,

04:06.614 --> 04:08.680
you're not my first NCIS agent.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.415
Not to date myself.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.584
As if I have to worry
about that with this crowd.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.752
<i> Partridge family.</i> Anybody?

04:13.754 --> 04:15.687
No, sir.
No? Nothing?

04:15.689 --> 04:18.690
Babies. It was during
the first Gulf war.

04:18.692 --> 04:20.959
I was wet behind the ears,
and this agent--

04:20.961 --> 04:22.794
oh, geez, what was his name?

04:22.796 --> 04:25.364
Anyway, I remember we were short
on Lidocaine that day

04:25.366 --> 04:27.933
but, lucky for him,
not cheap Tequila.

04:27.935 --> 04:32.004
All the sawbones in the world
and you get chuckles the clown.

04:32.006 --> 04:34.439
I bet this guy's
a hoot at parties.

04:34.441 --> 04:37.442
(Weakly):
Shut up, Mike.

04:37.444 --> 04:41.413
Oh. He speaks.
Uh, and it's cyril.

04:41.415 --> 04:43.548
And, unfortunately, you're stuck
with me until we fix all this.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.550
Now, i-i am not worried
about your head and your knee.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.985
We've got a great ortho
who's gonna replace

04:46.987 --> 04:48.420
the knee altogether.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.055
Now, the real megillah

04:50.057 --> 04:51.857
is the second bullet.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.392
It shattered on impact,

04:53.394 --> 04:55.527
leaving all these little shards
in your chest,

04:55.529 --> 04:57.429
meaning we got
a lot of little bleeders,

04:57.431 --> 04:58.730
some of them not so little.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.365
So that's why I got to get
in there asap.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.968
Where is DiNozzo?

05:02.970 --> 05:04.636
Teague?

05:06.774 --> 05:08.974
I was too far away.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.375
I should have been
right on his six.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.477
I let budd distract me.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.513
Stop blaming yourself.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.515
I knew, Joanna.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.750
He had me on the phone.

05:18.752 --> 05:21.953
I knew. He was watching us.

05:21.955 --> 05:24.556
You knew what? You knew
that our sweet little Luke

05:24.558 --> 05:26.391
was gonna shoot
his one true friend?

05:26.393 --> 05:28.393
Neither of us saw
that coming, Tony.

05:28.395 --> 05:29.761
How the hell could we?

05:29.763 --> 05:30.996
(Phone rings)

05:32.399 --> 05:33.398
It's Vance.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.901
This you knew was coming.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.636
(Phone beeps)
Director.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.970
Tell me he's alive.

05:38.972 --> 05:40.605
He is, sir, but it's bad.

05:40.607 --> 05:42.507
They're working on him now.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.509
I'm gonna stay here
till he's out of surgery.

05:44.511 --> 05:45.944
No, you're not.
The best thing you can do

05:45.946 --> 05:47.746
for Gibbs now is your job.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.382
Director...
If the calling's
still operating in Iraq,

05:50.384 --> 05:51.983
you need to get back there
while the trail is hot.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.986
Look, sir, no one wants Daniel
budd stopped more than I do.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.422
Then we don't stop, DiNozzo,

05:57.424 --> 05:59.458
until the calling's dismantled

05:59.460 --> 06:02.361
and this psychopath is captured
or dead.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.698
We owe Gibbs that much.
Are we clear?

06:06.700 --> 06:08.500
We're clear.

06:08.502 --> 06:10.502
(Phone beeps off)

06:10.504 --> 06:11.837
(Monitor beeping rhythmically)

06:11.839 --> 06:14.439
You comfortable, agent Gibbs?

06:14.441 --> 06:16.708
Taft:
Like me, Gibbs,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.610
you're blessed to have
good people around you.

06:18.612 --> 06:22.047
Got any more at home?
Kids? Wife?

06:22.049 --> 06:23.882
Ex...

06:23.884 --> 06:25.851
Wives.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.452
More than one.
(Chuckles)

06:27.454 --> 06:28.854
So you're doubly blessed.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.922
Which works for me.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.557
See, I hate to make threats,

06:32.559 --> 06:34.426
but I am about to do everything
in my power

06:34.428 --> 06:36.628
to make sure you
see those exes again.

06:36.630 --> 06:39.131
So you do your part,
I'll do mine. Deal?

06:39.133 --> 06:42.467
I'll buy you a drink
when it's done.

06:42.469 --> 06:44.002
First round's on me.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.704
You look like a bourbon man,
Gibbs.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.472
Oh, see, I used to know a guy

06:47.474 --> 06:50.142
in upstate New York,
hairy Tony,

06:50.144 --> 06:52.144
and every time he did a shot...

06:52.146 --> 06:53.545
(Beeping)
He's crashing.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.080
10cc's of epi.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.748
Let's put him under
and crack him.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.517
Time to dance, agent Gibbs.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.585
Mind if I lead?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.788
(Oxygen hissing)

07:11.899 --> 07:14.132
Still nothing? Anyone?

07:14.134 --> 07:15.734
Anyone? McGee?

07:15.736 --> 07:17.002
Really, Abby?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.837
I can plainly see yours.
You can't see mine?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.806
(Phone buzzing)
Ooh, that's yours, Jimmy.

07:20.808 --> 07:23.074
Who is it?
Sorry. (Chuckles)
Just my...

07:23.076 --> 07:25.811
Daily reminder to take
my digestive enzyme.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.112
Bishop:
Okay,

07:27.114 --> 07:29.581
all reminders, alerts,
and notifications

07:29.583 --> 07:32.651
should be turned off
until we get word on Gibbs.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.952
Right.
Abby:
So, the nurse that promised us

07:33.954 --> 07:35.987
an update is actually
on the ship, right?

07:35.989 --> 07:38.990
On the ship, just outside the or
with all our numbers.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.459
Well, don't forget,
it's the surgical ward

07:40.461 --> 07:41.693
of an aircraft carrier,

07:41.695 --> 07:43.795
so they're probably quite busy.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.864
And very well staffed,
apparently.

07:45.866 --> 07:46.865
Did you find the surgeon?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.099
Dr. cyril taft,

07:48.101 --> 07:49.868
Navy reserve captain.

07:49.870 --> 07:52.838
Decorated
Gulf war veteran

07:52.840 --> 07:56.107
and a former chief trauma
surgeon at Walter Reed.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.977
Hmm. After all that, what's
he doing stationed at sea?

07:58.979 --> 08:02.581
True warriors rarely go quietly.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.617
Like some other
doctors we know.

08:05.619 --> 08:07.686
Abby:
So Gibbs has his very own ducky

08:07.688 --> 08:09.521
performing his surgery.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.089
McGee:
Can't ask for
better than that.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.757
Well, no doubt

08:12.759 --> 08:15.093
this Dr. taft has seen it all.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.929
I'm sure that he has
everything with Jethro

08:17.931 --> 08:21.733
completely under control.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.803
Suction, please.

08:29.276 --> 08:31.776
Would you like some
more water, doctor?

08:31.778 --> 08:33.178
Uh, you've been with me
too long, Ryan.

08:33.180 --> 08:35.947
I'm a surgical mouth-breather.

08:38.552 --> 08:42.220
Oh. My tongue feels like karbala
in a dust storm.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.557
Got yourself in a
fine mess here, Gibbs.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.092
At worst, I expected
Swiss cheese,

08:47.094 --> 08:48.960
but you are leaking
like a rusty colander.

08:48.962 --> 08:52.931
Sponge. Thankfully, nothing's
permeated the heart muscle.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.099
We got a ways to go.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.034
How 'bout some music?
Any requests?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.304
Got an old mix tape up there,
mo and mo,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.072
half Mozart, half motown.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.675
You like motown, ensign?
My parents do.

09:03.677 --> 09:06.111
(Laughs): Thank you
for not saying "grandparents."

09:08.048 --> 09:10.181
Feel free to sing along, Gibbs.

09:10.183 --> 09:12.217
Okay, tie that one
off. One down,

09:12.219 --> 09:15.186
way too many to go.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.955
("My girl" by the temptations
playing)

09:16.957 --> 09:19.925
¶ I've got sunshine ¶

09:19.927 --> 09:24.162
(continues distantly):
¶ on a cloudy day ¶

09:24.164 --> 09:26.565
sitrep.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.033
¶ When it's cold outside ¶

09:28.035 --> 09:29.668
DiNozzo, sitrep.

09:29.670 --> 09:34.839
¶ I've got the month of may ¶

09:36.076 --> 09:37.142
hey, McGee.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.044
¶ I guess you'd say ¶

09:39.046 --> 09:41.079
bishop.

09:41.081 --> 09:45.116
¶ What can make me
feel this way? ¶

09:45.118 --> 09:46.952
¶ my girl, my girl... ¶

09:46.954 --> 09:49.020
(music fades)

09:50.190 --> 09:53.124
(Door opens, bell jingles)

09:53.126 --> 09:55.060
Jackson:
<i> Son.</i>

09:55.062 --> 09:56.828
Dorneget:
<i> Reporting for duty,</i>
<i> agent Gibbs.</i>

09:56.830 --> 09:58.830
(Train bells clanging)

09:58.832 --> 10:00.865
Young Gibbs:
<i> You got a rule for everything?</i>

10:00.867 --> 10:02.734
Shannon:
<i> Everyone needs a code</i>
<i> they can live by.</i>

10:02.736 --> 10:05.103
<i> I want to hear it again.</i>

10:05.105 --> 10:07.672
Gibbs:
<i> I will take care.</i>
<i> I will come back safe.</i>

10:07.674 --> 10:09.040
(Echoes):
<i> I love you.</i>

10:09.042 --> 10:11.242
(Girl giggling,
birds chirping)

10:11.244 --> 10:13.278
Franks:
<i> You do hear ghosts, probie.</i>

10:13.280 --> 10:18.216
I'm not up there.

10:21.755 --> 10:24.155
I'm right here, daddy.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.627
Kelly.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.195
Pulse and BP
are accelerating.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.130
Okay. I don't know what's got

10:32.132 --> 10:33.932
your ticker pumping, Gibbs,

10:33.934 --> 10:36.301
but keep it up. You know,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.236
I'd like to shake the hand
of whomever invented

10:38.238 --> 10:41.406
the exploding bullet and then...

10:41.408 --> 10:43.642
Shoot 'em. Ah.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.911
Order more blood and remind me
why I do this for a living.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.180
(Song continues)
¶ my girl, my girl... ¶

10:50.283 --> 10:53.351
(song fades)
Kelly.

10:54.388 --> 10:58.123
Just let me look at you.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.191
You got old.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.827
(Laughs)

11:02.829 --> 11:06.164
You didn't.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.299
Is that why you're wearing that?

11:08.301 --> 11:10.902
No.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.838
It's a long story.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.907
You do work here, right?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.009
Yeah, I do.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.844
Hey, guys?

11:23.383 --> 11:25.183
That's okay.

11:25.185 --> 11:26.951
We're not staying.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.028
(Elevator bell dings)

11:37.030 --> 11:39.097
(Seagulls screeching)

11:42.035 --> 11:44.035
(Classical music playing)
(Monitor beeping)

11:44.037 --> 11:46.071
Where you going, Gibbs?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.139
Can't leave now.
It's almost happy hour.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.709
Breathing's shallow.
He's in afib.

11:50.711 --> 11:52.277
Okay. Might have to shock him.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.245
Get that o-neg
on the rapid infuser.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.481
Did I miss one?

11:56.483 --> 11:59.150
Ah, you got to give
me a hint, Gibbs.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.885
Can somebody please
wipe my glasses?

12:00.887 --> 12:02.954
It's like I'm deep-sea diving
over here.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.459
(Seagulls screeching)

12:09.196 --> 12:11.362
(Girls screams happily)

12:12.332 --> 12:14.432
(Talking low, indistinctly)

12:14.434 --> 12:17.135
That was a good day.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.807
We had a lot of 'em.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.743
Not anymore.

12:24.745 --> 12:27.312
You don't have good days now.

12:28.815 --> 12:33.284
You spend too much time
thinking about the past.

12:33.286 --> 12:36.354
Plenty to think about.

12:36.356 --> 12:39.157
You have to stop, dad.

12:39.159 --> 12:42.293
Things are different.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.396
It's about the future now.

12:45.398 --> 12:48.199
There are too many
people counting on you.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.368
Gibbs:
Now, see,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.903
you let go
of your finger out there

12:51.905 --> 12:54.472
which is why
it goes out that way. All right.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.341
Days like this make me wonder

12:56.343 --> 12:58.243
why I didn't stay
in private practice.

12:58.245 --> 13:00.245
Oh, I've had my chances.

13:00.247 --> 13:02.313
Once even offered a shot

13:02.315 --> 13:05.316
at being the president's
personal physician.

13:05.318 --> 13:06.918
Dream gig, you know.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.419
Air force one,
the status.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.022
But, silly me,

13:11.024 --> 13:12.557
I played hard-to-get. Oh! Oh!

13:12.559 --> 13:14.425
There you are,
you sneaky little bastard.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.194
(Sighs)

13:16.196 --> 13:18.029
Clamp.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.435
Pressure's rising.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.104
Why play hard-to-get, sir?
Oh.

13:26.106 --> 13:27.338
Politics.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.974
In D.C., not even
doctors are immune.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.143
So, I said no.

13:32.145 --> 13:35.580
Two days later, the job went
to my friend, cubby Miller.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.516
Oncologist.
Sweetheart of a guy.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.285
More suction.

13:40.287 --> 13:43.321
Naturally, I was
kicking myself for days.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.456
And then, one night,
i got a page.

13:45.458 --> 13:48.293
Five-year-old boy
in a head-on collision.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.461
Subcompact versus beltway.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.863
(Sighs)

13:51.865 --> 13:53.464
Kid was a disaster.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.400
Died on the table three times

13:55.402 --> 13:58.269
in the 22 hours I spent trying
to piece him back together.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.371
And did he
make it, doctor?

14:00.373 --> 14:03.408
Oh, yeah. He just graduated
Georgetown law.

14:03.410 --> 14:06.411
Best thing I ever did
was not take that job.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.447
That kid was a good reason why.

14:09.449 --> 14:12.483
Maybe you're another one, Gibbs.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.552
(Monitors beeping rhythmically)

14:16.256 --> 14:18.156
(Seagulls screeching)

14:18.158 --> 14:20.225
(Giggling)

14:24.431 --> 14:27.398
I miss you, Kelly.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.601
You and mom.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.402
Every day.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.872
I know.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.442
But we never really left.

14:40.981 --> 14:45.183
What you said before
about people counting on me?

14:49.089 --> 14:52.323
I'm not sure
what more I can do.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.559
So what then?

14:54.561 --> 14:57.061
You're giving up?

14:57.063 --> 14:59.497
No, I didn't say that.

14:59.499 --> 15:01.466
Fight back.

15:02.402 --> 15:06.271
Bad people are
still out there.

15:06.273 --> 15:08.473
If you don't stop them,

15:08.475 --> 15:11.609
who will?

15:16.182 --> 15:18.249
(Low chatter)

15:19.486 --> 15:22.153
(Sighs)

15:25.926 --> 15:27.926
Kelly?

15:27.928 --> 15:30.395
(Shouting):
Kelly?!

15:30.397 --> 15:33.464
Ryan:
Okay, pressure's
stabilizing.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.233
Normal sinus. He's...

15:35.235 --> 15:37.568
He's breathing
on his own.
Oh.

15:37.570 --> 15:40.538
No. No, no, no.
Thank you. Thank you.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.307
Now let's close.
I'm here all week.

15:42.309 --> 15:43.708
Tip your waitresses.

15:43.710 --> 15:45.510
(Sighs)

15:45.512 --> 15:47.578
(Groans)

15:48.682 --> 15:52.116
Forget the bourbon,
you tough son of a bitch.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.018
Make mine a 15-year-old
single malt.

16:06.099 --> 16:09.467
Our other top story-- the rising
tensions with north Korea.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.003
Sources on capitol hill today
confirm a recent wave

16:12.005 --> 16:14.105
of tough talk out
of Pyongyang...

16:14.107 --> 16:15.506
It's amazing how
a government memo

16:15.508 --> 16:16.574
that was
confidential yesterday

16:16.576 --> 16:18.376
ends up on
the news today.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.478
Bishop:
Well, if I were
to don my NSA hat,

16:20.480 --> 16:23.414
I'd say the leak probably
came from the north Koreans

16:23.416 --> 16:25.016
themselves.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.451
Right. And what good is
the chest-thumping

16:26.453 --> 16:27.986
if the world
can't hear it?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.421
Ruthless dictators
do love an audience.

16:32.125 --> 16:35.460
Boss?!
Gibbs!
You're back!

16:35.462 --> 16:38.329
I thought we weren't supposed to
see you for another few weeks.

16:38.331 --> 16:41.065
Hey, did you ever get that last
fruit basket from me and Jake?

16:41.067 --> 16:43.434
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, I got it.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.371
Where's DiNozzo?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.206
Oh. Right.

16:48.208 --> 16:49.607
Uh, you wouldn't
have heard.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.677
He and officer teague are

16:52.679 --> 16:54.112
on assignment.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.548
Boss, I'm sorry.
They... they pretty much put us

16:57.550 --> 16:59.584
under orders.
We're not allowed to talk to you

16:59.586 --> 17:02.286
about work while
you're recuperating.
Oh, yeah.

17:02.288 --> 17:04.756
Well, that made for some
riveting home visits.

17:04.758 --> 17:07.692
But, uh, no,
I'm-I'm back.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.528
Yeah. I'm good.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.296
Let me be the judge of that.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.601
Take the elevator.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.572
(Door opens, closes)

17:21.574 --> 17:24.275
DiNozzo and teague?

17:24.277 --> 17:27.078
Something to do
with the calling?

17:27.080 --> 17:30.581
Well, it's good
to see you, too, Gibbs.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.184
Hey, did you ever get
the fruit-of-the-month club

17:33.186 --> 17:35.686
that I signed you up for?

17:37.657 --> 17:40.091
They landed in Shanghai
about an hour ago.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.526
Shanghai?

17:41.528 --> 17:44.128
Off a tip
just yesterday

17:44.130 --> 17:46.464
from one of teague's
CIA contacts.

17:46.466 --> 17:50.668
Allegedly, Daniel budd has moved
his entire operation there.

17:50.670 --> 17:53.337
Complete with his band
of teenage nightmares.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.539
Might have something to do

17:54.541 --> 17:56.441
with them falling off the map
in Iraq.

17:56.443 --> 17:57.642
Yeah, just might.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.744
It's like they vanished.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.712
That why you called me back?

18:01.714 --> 18:05.083
It hasn't been easy trying to
keep you out of the loop, Gibbs.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.118
You are beyond too close.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.688
Not to mention Dr. taft wanting
you to avoid physical stress.

18:10.690 --> 18:12.523
You called taft?

18:12.525 --> 18:14.525
The man saved your life, Gibbs.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.327
You might want to listen to him.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.129
Then why<i> am</i> I here?

18:18.131 --> 18:20.731
You're here
on administrative duty.

18:20.733 --> 18:22.834
With DiNozzo away,
i figured

18:22.836 --> 18:25.203
McGee and bishop would
appreciate your support

18:25.205 --> 18:27.672
in the office, not in the field.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.307
Look...

18:29.309 --> 18:33.411
Leon, I'm not gonna try to
sit here and tell you I'm 100%.

18:33.413 --> 18:36.481
But chaining me to a desk?

18:36.483 --> 18:39.650
You can take it,
or go home.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.553
(Rapid knocking on door)

18:42.555 --> 18:44.689
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs,
Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs, Gibbs!

18:44.691 --> 18:46.591
Are you okay?
Yeah.

18:46.593 --> 18:48.359
What are you doing here?

18:48.361 --> 18:50.194
You're supposed to be resting.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.630
Abby, I'm fine. I'm-I'm fine.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.532
Well, look... good.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.635
Must be all that fruit
that I brought over.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.138
Oh, yeah, the fruit.
Yeah, I got the fruit.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.673
I got enough fruit
to feed a band of gorillas.

19:02.675 --> 19:05.743
I was gonna bring you
some soup later tonight,

19:05.745 --> 19:07.411
but since you're here,
i could just make it in my lab,

19:07.413 --> 19:08.846
and you could have it for lunch.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.582
Well, if you need me,

19:11.584 --> 19:14.485
I'll be at my desk.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.187
(Door closes)

19:16.189 --> 19:18.256
(Music playing,
fireworks popping)

19:20.727 --> 19:22.460
I'm glad you know
where you're going.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.896
Oh, I actually took a wrong turn
a ways back, but we're good now.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.597
It's just a couple blocks more.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.699
Well, you could have
just said, "yes, I do,"

19:28.701 --> 19:30.768
and I would have
been none the wiser,

19:30.770 --> 19:32.370
but that's not
your style, is it?

19:32.372 --> 19:35.373
Ah, yeah, honest
to a fault.

19:35.375 --> 19:36.774
Is that a problem?

19:36.776 --> 19:38.743
Quite the opposite.
I like your style.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.611
Reminds me of somebody.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.613
Old dorney.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.848
Never one for subterfuge.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.850
I guess he learned
from the best.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.419
Maybe I learned from him.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.288
Never thought I'd see
Shanghai like this.

19:50.290 --> 19:53.591
Ooh, hold on.
I'm a tie man.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.396
And made in the U.S.A.

19:58.398 --> 20:00.598
I would like
to buy this tie. Oh, sorry.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.233
(Speaking mandarin)

20:02.235 --> 20:04.302
Oh, listen to you. Impressive.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.270
I've been working on it.
(Speaking mandarin)

20:06.272 --> 20:07.805
(Speaking mandarin)

20:10.476 --> 20:12.944
Ooh. I didn't get... sorry.
Can you just back that up?

20:12.946 --> 20:14.845
It was a little fast.
(Speaking mandarin)

20:14.847 --> 20:16.914
(Speaking mandarin)

20:18.751 --> 20:20.751
Oh.
Nice.

20:20.753 --> 20:23.454
You have been so good for
my ego these past few months.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.889
I'm gonna check in
with McGee.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.824
(Phone beeps, line ringing)

20:26.826 --> 20:28.259
McGee:
Agent McGee here.
Hey.

20:28.261 --> 20:29.660
Tony, I sent you those files

20:29.662 --> 20:31.729
just after you left,
so check your in box.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.231
As soon as we're back
at the hotel.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.765
We missing anything there?

20:34.767 --> 20:36.567
Well, as a matter of fact.

20:36.569 --> 20:37.768
Put him on the speaker.

20:37.770 --> 20:38.970
Please hold for Gibbs.

20:38.972 --> 20:40.304
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.839
Gibbs? He's there?

20:42.842 --> 20:44.408
Hey, boss.

20:44.410 --> 20:45.776
Teague with you?

20:45.778 --> 20:48.679
Yeah. We're on our way
to meet her contact now.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.748
Tony, we got
to get going.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.949
DiNozzo?

20:51.951 --> 20:54.952
Rule 45-- I got it.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.489
(Phone beeps off)

20:58.491 --> 20:59.890
McGee:
He was in a crowd.

20:59.892 --> 21:01.292
Maybe it was tough
for him to hear.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.594
It's been hard on all of us

21:03.596 --> 21:05.596
not catching budd
after all this time,

21:05.598 --> 21:06.664
and never finding Luke.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.000
Been eating at Tony--
i know that.

21:09.002 --> 21:10.468
Budd's been quiet.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.770
Maybe too quiet.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.005
Is it something we said?

21:14.007 --> 21:15.306
Taking a walk.

21:15.308 --> 21:16.674
I'll be back later.

21:18.011 --> 21:20.344
Well...

21:20.346 --> 21:23.347
I think McGee could've given me
a little bit better heads up.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.349
"Rule 45"-- what's that?

21:25.351 --> 21:27.918
Clean up your own mess.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.921
It's not all yours, Tony.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.024
So, where's your contact?

21:33.026 --> 21:35.726
Oh, right on time.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.335
CIA officer Kenny yong,

21:44.337 --> 21:46.537
say hello to special agent
Tony DiNozzo.

21:46.539 --> 21:49.040
DiNozzo, heard a
lot about you.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.675
Wish I could say
the same, yong.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.376
Hang on.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.511
(Tires squealing)

21:53.513 --> 21:54.912
(Shrieks)

21:54.914 --> 21:56.747
Oh...

21:58.384 --> 21:59.617
And here I thought
you weren't

21:59.619 --> 22:01.319
a real cab driver.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.421
These calling rumors have
a lot of people jumpy,

22:03.423 --> 22:04.855
myself included.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.624
Our intel believes
they've set up shop

22:06.626 --> 22:09.427
in an old computer factory
just outside of town.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.562
Have we checked it out?
Surveillance unit's

22:11.564 --> 22:14.632
(phone ringing)
Being dispatched,
but it'll take time.

22:14.634 --> 22:15.933
We don't have time.

22:15.935 --> 22:18.102
Hold on a second.
DiNozzo.

22:18.104 --> 22:20.604
Daniel:
Do you know what they used to
call this town, agent DiNozzo?

22:20.606 --> 22:23.641
Paris of the orient.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.876
But it's nothing like
Paris, is it?

22:25.878 --> 22:28.646
Hell, not even Paris

22:28.648 --> 22:29.980
is like Paris anymore.

22:34.821 --> 22:36.821
World's getting smaller.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.589
Like the distance
between us?

22:38.591 --> 22:41.125
How's our connection, Daniel--
can you hear me okay?

22:41.127 --> 22:43.561
Why?

22:43.563 --> 22:44.929
Am I breaking up?

22:44.931 --> 22:47.665
No, but you will be,

22:47.667 --> 22:49.967
into little pieces,
as soon as I find you.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.670
Unless you end up
like your boss.

22:52.672 --> 22:55.439
Lot of mileage on that man.

22:55.441 --> 22:57.808
But he's got stamina.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.010
The question is, Tony...

23:00.012 --> 23:01.445
Do you?

23:01.447 --> 23:03.013
Guess we'll find out.

23:03.015 --> 23:06.584
Game's just begun.

23:06.586 --> 23:08.519
You be careful.

23:08.521 --> 23:10.588
Oh, damn.

23:10.590 --> 23:13.124
Well, so much
for tracing the signal.

23:13.126 --> 23:16.127
(Buzzer sounds)

23:16.129 --> 23:17.995
Man (Over P.A.):
A block, sections
one through four.

23:17.997 --> 23:20.064
(Announcement continues
indistinctly)

23:23.002 --> 23:25.703
Look who's back from the dead.

23:25.705 --> 23:28.706
Can't say the same for you.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.583
Had I known,
i might have washed up.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.652
(Buzzer sounds)

23:42.889 --> 23:46.657
No luck finding my
friends, I take it.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.025
Perhaps you now realize

23:48.027 --> 23:50.661
the true power of the calling.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.998
What, and you
the power of solitary?

23:54.000 --> 23:56.801
What do you want?

23:56.803 --> 23:58.202
Shanghai.

23:58.204 --> 24:01.705
Where, exactly, and why?

24:01.707 --> 24:03.974
You think I know
from in here?

24:03.976 --> 24:06.877
If it was part
of the long-range plan.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.780
Huh.
(Both laughing)

24:09.782 --> 24:12.683
Look at you.

24:12.685 --> 24:15.753
Oozing with confidence.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.022
But who is the one

24:18.024 --> 24:20.024
needing answers?

24:20.026 --> 24:23.761
We're calling the shots.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.901
(Screaming)

24:30.903 --> 24:32.236
You want to play?

24:34.907 --> 24:36.907
My rules.

24:36.909 --> 24:39.710
My game.

24:39.712 --> 24:41.912
The game is changing.

24:41.914 --> 24:45.149
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah, you bet it is.

24:45.151 --> 24:46.917
(Screaming)

24:46.919 --> 24:49.053
Guard!

24:52.892 --> 24:55.159
Talk first.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.228
Deal second.

24:57.230 --> 24:59.497
(Buzzer sounds)

25:00.800 --> 25:02.867
You know where to find me.

25:04.637 --> 25:06.871
Vance:
<i> How was your walk, Gibbs?</i>

25:06.873 --> 25:09.073
You make it to Cleveland
and back?

25:09.075 --> 25:10.774
Who are we
waiting for?

25:10.776 --> 25:13.611
Transmission from
the secretary of defense.

25:13.613 --> 25:16.280
Up, coming through
now, director.

25:16.282 --> 25:17.515
Mr. secretary.

25:17.517 --> 25:18.949
Director.

25:18.951 --> 25:20.985
I wish I was reaching out under
better circumstances.

25:20.987 --> 25:22.887
How can we help?

25:22.889 --> 25:24.922
This bluster
out of north Korea

25:24.924 --> 25:26.790
just took a very dark turn.

25:26.792 --> 25:28.792
Some of our equipment
just red-flagged

25:28.794 --> 25:30.961
a north Korean sinpo-class sub

25:30.963 --> 25:33.764
arming a nuclear warhead
in the sea of Japan.

25:33.766 --> 25:35.266
A warhead, sir?

25:35.268 --> 25:36.967
P-8s out of misawa.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.736
Picked it up on active sonar.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.137
We're-we're still
trying to verify, but

25:40.139 --> 25:41.872
pacfleet's all ready to engage

25:41.874 --> 25:43.007
any threat if necessary.

25:44.810 --> 25:48.279
With all due respect, sir,
why loop in NCIS?

25:48.281 --> 25:50.748
Because we found
a whole bunch of computers

25:50.750 --> 25:52.583
linked to the north Koreans...

25:52.585 --> 25:54.118
And one of them's yours.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.220
One of our computers?

25:56.222 --> 25:57.254
You send the data link?

25:59.892 --> 26:02.126
Already getting it.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.996
(Computer chirping, beeping)

26:05.998 --> 26:07.965
Confirmed,
it is one of ours.

26:07.967 --> 26:09.667
Whose computer, McGee?

26:15.274 --> 26:17.741
It's agent dorneget's laptop.

26:26.852 --> 26:28.586
Reporter: ...Among the
allegations, the sabotage

26:28.588 --> 26:30.354
of Pyongyang
international airport.

26:30.356 --> 26:33.157
Thanks, Jake.
Call me later.

26:33.159 --> 26:35.326
NSA didn't intercept
the north Korean signal,

26:35.328 --> 26:37.861
but says that we should
take the threat seriously.

26:37.863 --> 26:40.631
The white house is keeping
a lid on it from the press.

26:40.633 --> 26:41.966
Only while they can.

26:41.968 --> 26:43.734
How the hell could dorneget

26:43.736 --> 26:44.902
be tied up
with the north Koreans?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.237
Four months after his death.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.639
Maybe because his computer
is still alive.

26:48.641 --> 26:49.273
You found it.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.307
On the shelf,

26:50.309 --> 26:51.742
but not deactivated.

26:51.744 --> 26:53.277
(Phone ringing)
Fire it up, McGee.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.613
I want that thing combed
from top to bottom.

26:55.615 --> 26:56.914
Vance.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.351
Tim, why is it still active?

27:00.353 --> 27:01.952
Well, cyber division
has a policy

27:01.954 --> 27:03.988
of keeping workstations tied

27:03.990 --> 27:05.322
to active cases
powered up and running.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.657
Mind if I jump in with you?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.092
Two heads are better
than one.

27:08.094 --> 27:10.260
Make it three.
Pull Abby in, too.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.829
Let's just remember whose
computer we're talking

27:11.831 --> 27:13.330
about here-- getting
into dorney's hard drive?

27:13.332 --> 27:16.300
Well, that can be
an adventure on its own.

27:16.302 --> 27:18.102
Thank you very much.

27:18.104 --> 27:20.938
That was the warden
from Lee penitentiary.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.807
Apparently your walk included
a visit with Matthew Rousseau.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.175
Would you mind
telling me why?

27:25.177 --> 27:26.977
Just following up.

27:26.979 --> 27:30.147
With your pen
stuck in his hand?

27:30.149 --> 27:32.316
Is that where I left it?

27:32.318 --> 27:34.051
If by "following up,"
you mean offering a deal,

27:34.053 --> 27:35.419
you can forget it.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.988
They just found him...

27:37.990 --> 27:40.424
Hanging from a bed sheet
in his cell.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.732
(Yong speaks indistinctly)
(Phone beeps off)

27:48.734 --> 27:50.934
Yong:
Surveillance crew's ready to go,
but they'll be a while.

27:50.936 --> 27:52.269
What is with all the delays?

27:52.271 --> 27:53.771
We're CIA, Tony.

27:53.773 --> 27:55.139
If we can't be stealthy
about it,

27:55.141 --> 27:56.373
we don't go.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.409
Well, I'm not CIA

27:58.411 --> 28:00.878
and I'm done waiting.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.213
So, let's go.

28:17.229 --> 28:19.229
(Quietly):
It's live.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.032
Warm and toasty.

28:29.375 --> 28:30.974
U.S. agents!

28:30.976 --> 28:33.010
NCIS!

28:33.012 --> 28:34.244
(Shouting in mandarin)

28:34.246 --> 28:35.312
Teague:
Put your hands up

28:35.314 --> 28:37.047
where we can see them.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.858
Luke?

28:47.860 --> 28:51.161
It's okay, Luke.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.399
Make sure he doesn't have a gun.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.068
It's okay.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.340
(Teague cries out)

29:03.342 --> 29:05.409
Joanna, no!

29:05.411 --> 29:07.778
Yong, block the door!

29:07.780 --> 29:10.414
We got to get out of here!

29:10.416 --> 29:13.350
DiNozzo!

29:13.352 --> 29:15.352
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

29:16.422 --> 29:18.489
(Explosion)

29:21.961 --> 29:23.360
Joanna.

29:23.362 --> 29:26.196
Luke went up on the roof.

29:26.198 --> 29:27.364
We're tracking
the north Koreans'

29:27.366 --> 29:29.466
sinpo-class sub, Mr. secretary.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.969
My t.A.O. Is ready for
a preemptive strike upon order.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.972
That engagement order comes from
the president only, commander.

29:34.974 --> 29:37.274
I don't follow.
Why aren't they running stealth?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.276
Helluva mistake on their part.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.478
Or they sent
the signal on purpose.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.213
Like we're being baited?

29:43.215 --> 29:45.449
They got our attention.

29:45.451 --> 29:47.217
Either way, I need to know
what's on that computer,

29:47.219 --> 29:49.119
director, before it puts us

29:49.121 --> 29:51.488
neck deep in world war III.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.959
Anything?

29:55.961 --> 29:57.828
Trying.
Abby?

29:57.830 --> 29:59.797
Well, can I just say

29:59.799 --> 30:02.900
that dorneget was some kind
of crazy, amazing genius.

30:02.902 --> 30:06.003
He had access to a lot
of classified information.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.572
McGee:
Well, we need answers now.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.975
Ah, there you are, Jethro.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.443
You wanted it fast.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.112
Mr. Palmer made it so.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.314
Good work, Palmer.
Yeah, the prison

30:17.316 --> 30:19.149
was not too happy
about surrendering jurisdiction.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.450
I guess inmate suicide

30:20.452 --> 30:22.419
does not look too good
on their record.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.354
Uh, well, not as bad as this.

30:24.356 --> 30:26.590
Couldn't be suicide.

30:26.592 --> 30:28.091
Quite apart from

30:28.093 --> 30:30.160
the puncture wound in his hand,

30:30.162 --> 30:31.595
the crush injuries

30:31.597 --> 30:34.198
to the c2 and c3 vertebrae

30:34.200 --> 30:37.434
show blunt force trauma,
not strangulation.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.136
Murdered before?

30:39.138 --> 30:40.437
Yeah, it appears
that not even

30:40.439 --> 30:42.206
prison walls can
keep the calling

30:42.208 --> 30:44.107
from doing their

30:44.109 --> 30:47.578
insidious dirty work.

30:52.218 --> 30:54.585
That's far enough.

30:57.289 --> 30:59.456
Luke, don't.

30:59.458 --> 31:02.292
I'm sorry.

31:02.294 --> 31:05.128
I-i can't keep running.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.366
You can come back with us.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.641
You saw what I did.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.411
You were there.

31:21.413 --> 31:23.413
I shot him.

31:23.415 --> 31:26.550
I killed Gibbs.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.552
Luke, he made it.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.254
He's alive.

31:30.256 --> 31:32.890
But I saw him.

31:34.460 --> 31:36.460
You're lying.

31:36.462 --> 31:39.663
Only one way to find out.

31:39.665 --> 31:43.066
What's it gonna be?

31:45.537 --> 31:48.639
Defense secretary:
The north Koreans
are denying everything.

31:48.641 --> 31:50.073
Insisting this is a mistake.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.575
No launch codes
have been administered.

31:51.577 --> 31:53.677
Some of our sensors
say otherwise, sir.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.679
Who are we supposed to trust?

31:55.681 --> 31:58.048
Time's up, director.

31:58.050 --> 31:59.683
I'm going to the joint
chiefs to suggest we take

31:59.685 --> 32:01.585
some form of action
against the north Koreans.

32:01.587 --> 32:05.589
Sir, my team is certain
that there's more to this.

32:05.591 --> 32:09.226
1,200 feet beneath me,
director, is a crew prepared

32:09.228 --> 32:11.662
to launch an attack
of devastating proportion.

32:11.664 --> 32:14.164
Now I appreciate the trust
you have in your people,

32:14.166 --> 32:15.933
but my job
is to trust our intel

32:15.935 --> 32:18.936
and the intel says
get ready to fight.

32:26.111 --> 32:27.577
Miss Sciuto.
Abby: Yes, director?

32:27.579 --> 32:30.280
Put agent McGee on the phone.
Okay.

32:38.490 --> 32:41.692
Hey, boss, we found something
you've been looking for.

32:41.694 --> 32:44.995
I'll be flying him home
in a few hours, Gibbs.

32:44.997 --> 32:47.531
But we had to prove
you were alive first.

32:47.533 --> 32:50.300
I don't understand.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.169
How?

32:52.171 --> 32:54.705
It doesn't matter.

32:54.707 --> 32:57.040
The only thing that does
is what happens next.

32:57.042 --> 32:59.042
It's your decision.

32:59.044 --> 33:02.579
I'm sorry, Gibbs.

33:05.617 --> 33:07.718
Where's budd?

33:07.720 --> 33:10.687
He's using other kids
in Shanghai,

33:10.689 --> 33:13.090
like he used me.

33:13.092 --> 33:16.326
That wasn't
his only computer hub.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.095
He's hacking from two more.

33:18.097 --> 33:20.731
Teague:
Why Shanghai, Luke?

33:20.733 --> 33:23.266
Luke:
He's meeting

33:23.268 --> 33:26.403
with the Chinese today.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.739
Some sort of business deal.

33:28.741 --> 33:31.708
The calling was his way
of showing what he's capable of.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.777
Where's the meeting?

33:37.750 --> 33:39.616
Bishop:
He's got everything here

33:39.618 --> 33:42.019
from chat room documents
to the dod.

33:42.021 --> 33:43.620
Wait a minute.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.122
What if someone tried
to backdoor his laptop

33:45.124 --> 33:47.190
to get into
the Pentagon mainframe?

33:47.192 --> 33:50.527
You mean the calling knew
ned was watching them?

33:50.529 --> 33:53.163
So, while he was
watching them,

33:53.165 --> 33:56.533
they used his computer to hack
into our warning system.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.668
We've been busy searching
for a link to north Korea.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.771
Are we thinking
it was Daniel budd

34:00.773 --> 34:02.372
who armed the warhead?

34:03.675 --> 34:05.375
(Door opens)
McGee:
Director?

34:05.377 --> 34:06.676
It's Daniel budd.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.278
It's about the calling.

34:08.280 --> 34:10.147
Budd wants us to believe
it's the north Koreans.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.181
Keep talking.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.783
But we are confident

34:12.785 --> 34:14.351
the north Korean signal

34:14.353 --> 34:15.685
is not real.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.821
Budd manufactured it
in Shanghai

34:17.823 --> 34:19.456
and hacked
through dorney's computer

34:19.458 --> 34:22.459
into our defense alert systems.

34:22.461 --> 34:23.660
Budd did this?

34:23.662 --> 34:24.728
Budd knows that we constantly

34:24.730 --> 34:26.496
monitor military threats.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.332
Through agent dorneget's
Pentagon access,

34:29.334 --> 34:30.834
budd was able to create
a phony red flag

34:30.836 --> 34:32.803
arming the sub's warhead.

34:32.805 --> 34:35.205
He-he's a gamer, director.
He's playing with us.

34:35.207 --> 34:38.075
Are you telling me this is
all some stupid war game?

34:38.077 --> 34:40.777
Budd is auditioning to sell
his services to the Chinese.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.779
What better way to up his price

34:42.781 --> 34:45.148
than by demonstrating
how much damage he can do?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.851
Director, if we're being duped,
i need proof.

34:47.853 --> 34:50.487
(Alarm beeping)
Better make it quick.
We're detecting a second signal.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.722
Defense secretary:
Talk to me, commander.

34:52.724 --> 34:54.124
They're entering
launch codes, sir.

34:54.126 --> 34:56.093
Still think
this is a game, director?

34:56.095 --> 34:58.428
The calling's just upping
the stakes, but it isn't real.

34:58.430 --> 35:00.397
They're trying to scare us
into a response.

35:00.399 --> 35:02.766
I can stop this from here.

35:02.768 --> 35:05.235
Give me the president.

35:05.237 --> 35:07.771
(Alarm beeping)

35:07.773 --> 35:08.772
(Quietly):
Come on, McGee.

35:08.774 --> 35:09.773
Smoke and mirrors.

35:09.775 --> 35:11.141
One second, boss.

35:13.512 --> 35:14.778
Now, Tim.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.480
(Beeping continues)

35:16.482 --> 35:17.547
(Quietly):
Come on.

35:20.853 --> 35:22.886
(Beeping stops)

35:24.423 --> 35:26.423
Commander?

35:26.425 --> 35:28.191
The warhead, Mr. secretary.

35:28.193 --> 35:29.860
It's no longer armed.

35:31.196 --> 35:32.829
Stand down, commander.

35:32.831 --> 35:35.132
Commander:
Roger Wilco, sir.

35:35.134 --> 35:36.233
And amen.
Cortland out.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.809
(Phone ringing)

35:50.182 --> 35:52.382
Is there something
we forgot?

35:52.384 --> 35:53.717
(Tony speaking mandarin
on phone)

35:53.719 --> 35:54.851
English, please.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.586
You know I don't speak Chinese.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.555
It's mandarin, Danny boy.

35:58.557 --> 36:01.791
It's what they speak
in that Paris of the orient.

36:01.793 --> 36:04.294
Come to make the day
more exciting, have you?

36:04.296 --> 36:06.196
Oh, yeah.

36:06.198 --> 36:08.932
Shooting you in the chest
at close range,

36:08.934 --> 36:11.234
then a little dim sum--

36:11.236 --> 36:13.336
perfect day.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.174
(Whistles)

36:20.379 --> 36:22.445
Well...

36:22.447 --> 36:25.749
By all means.

36:25.751 --> 36:26.850
(Grunting)

36:26.852 --> 36:28.218
Move!

36:29.188 --> 36:29.819
Out of the way!

36:32.224 --> 36:33.456
Tony:
Yong, look out!

36:33.458 --> 36:34.791
(Gunshot)

36:34.793 --> 36:35.926
(People screaming)

36:35.928 --> 36:37.194
(Yong groaning)

36:37.796 --> 36:38.828
Go! Go! I'm okay.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.263
I'm okay.

36:41.833 --> 36:44.467
(Shouts in mandarin)

36:45.604 --> 36:47.671
(Rooster crowing)

36:51.310 --> 36:53.376
(Baby crying)

36:58.317 --> 37:00.283
Hands where I can see them.

37:05.724 --> 37:08.658
What about the hands
you don't see, agent DiNozzo?

37:08.660 --> 37:10.760
I've got them
all over the world.

37:10.762 --> 37:12.696
Do you?

37:12.698 --> 37:15.332
Well, I'm only interested
in these two.

37:15.334 --> 37:17.767
You think you've won.

37:17.769 --> 37:20.003
But manipulating
your legal system

37:20.005 --> 37:21.338
will be child's play

37:21.340 --> 37:22.872
for a man of my talent.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.774
And I know children who can...

37:24.776 --> 37:27.577
(Groans)

37:27.579 --> 37:29.279
Was that a threat?

37:29.281 --> 37:30.847
Sounded like a threat.

37:30.849 --> 37:33.316
I had to defend myself.

37:36.622 --> 37:39.022
How did that feel, Tony?

37:39.024 --> 37:41.891
Did you enjoy the rush?

37:41.893 --> 37:44.527
The power?

37:45.964 --> 37:47.964
You're not
a bond villain, Daniel.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.833
You're a fraud.

37:49.835 --> 37:52.736
And frauds don't get
to speechify like bond villains.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.674
They do get to die like them.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.346
(Gunshot echoes)

38:03.949 --> 38:05.949
(Chimes tinkling)

38:05.951 --> 38:08.018
(Dog barks in distance)

38:20.465 --> 38:22.599
(Seagulls screeching)

38:22.601 --> 38:26.536
Bishop:
Wish I could say it was quiet
around here without you, Tony.

38:28.540 --> 38:30.907
Tony, where are you?

38:30.909 --> 38:32.742
Nowhere.

38:32.744 --> 38:35.011
Just thinking.

38:35.013 --> 38:36.713
(Elevator bell dings)
Shanghai?

38:36.715 --> 38:39.649
Mm. Seen enough of that place.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.950
Ha. You and me both.

38:40.952 --> 38:43.053
How'd it go
at juvie, boss?

38:43.055 --> 38:45.021
Uh, Luke's gonna be there
for a while.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.956
Then a halfway house.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.992
Teague:
The adoptive relatives
insist he's still family

38:48.994 --> 38:51.661
and they want
to keep it that way.

38:51.663 --> 38:54.464
And you still owe me
for that tie.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.466
I pay my debts.
I brought Chinese.

38:56.468 --> 38:57.967
It looked better
in Shanghai.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.636
Eh, keep it.

38:59.638 --> 39:01.037
My parting gift.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.039
Oh, thank you.
Duty calls.

39:03.041 --> 39:06.009
I'm, uh, gonna grab a
flight out this afternoon.

39:06.011 --> 39:09.079
Before you go...

39:09.081 --> 39:12.549
We, uh, wanted
to give you this.

39:12.551 --> 39:14.984
It's ned's laptop.

39:14.986 --> 39:17.987
It's been scrubbed of all
its intel, but there's still

39:17.989 --> 39:19.823
tons of photos
and writings on there

39:19.825 --> 39:22.359
that we know ned
would want you to have.

39:22.361 --> 39:25.729
One of the comforts I've
had these last few months

39:25.731 --> 39:28.732
is knowing ned
had friends like you.

39:28.734 --> 39:31.434
Thank you.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.472
Thanks, Tim.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.042
Gibbs?

39:43.014 --> 39:45.014
Take care of your team.

39:45.016 --> 39:48.151
And, uh, maybe let your team
take care of you.

39:48.153 --> 39:50.420
Safe travels.

39:58.163 --> 40:00.096
So, everything's
back to normal, right?

40:00.098 --> 40:02.866
I guess that's all...
Cleared up.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.435
Well, you know, I mean...

40:10.776 --> 40:13.877
(Quietly):
Do we need to talk, boss?

40:15.180 --> 40:18.782
What would you like
to talk about, DiNozzo?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.158
Got to go.

40:33.465 --> 40:35.598
(Door opens, bell jingles)

40:38.036 --> 40:40.670
Hmm, well,
I'll be damned.

40:40.672 --> 40:43.873
The mountain came to Mohammed.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.742
You can't be surprised.

40:45.744 --> 40:47.477
You cancelled your last two

40:47.479 --> 40:48.745
follow-ups at Walter Reed

40:48.747 --> 40:51.481
and you still owe me
that single malt.

40:51.483 --> 40:54.784
Been busy.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.888
You know, I do make house calls.

40:58.890 --> 41:00.523
I'm not easy to shake.

41:00.525 --> 41:02.926
Especially with patients
i find challenging.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.195
I'm a challenge?

41:05.197 --> 41:07.964
Oh, you know,
everybody

41:07.966 --> 41:10.834
watching me
telling me to take it easy.

41:12.838 --> 41:15.738
Afraid I'm gonna break.

41:15.740 --> 41:18.141
Are you?

41:19.911 --> 41:22.212
It hurts.

41:24.883 --> 41:26.983
The pain doesn't go away.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.252
The leg?

41:29.254 --> 41:31.521
Yeah, all of it.

41:31.523 --> 41:34.691
Well, going back to work
after all you've been through

41:34.693 --> 41:36.926
is, uh...

41:36.928 --> 41:39.696
Ill-advised at best.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.865
Yeah, this coming
from the guy who keeps

41:41.867 --> 41:44.701
leaving private practice
to work on a ship?

41:45.971 --> 41:48.872
I do that out of boredom.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.710
Which I guess is just
a nicer way of saying

41:53.712 --> 41:55.879
depression.
(Chuckles)

41:55.881 --> 41:59.649
My, uh, my wife and I lost
our son two years ago.

41:59.651 --> 42:02.952
Um, leukemia.

42:02.954 --> 42:04.187
Uh, if I wasn't back at it,

42:04.189 --> 42:06.155
I'd be nowhere.

42:06.157 --> 42:08.525
Literally.

42:08.527 --> 42:11.661
Well, I am glad
you're back at it.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.563
Are you?

42:14.533 --> 42:16.733
Well, what does that mean?

42:16.735 --> 42:19.269
Mm, just a feeling I get.

42:19.271 --> 42:22.972
You see, uh, I have
two kinds of patients.

42:22.974 --> 42:26.009
Uh, those who revere me
for saving their lives,

42:26.011 --> 42:28.945
uh, and those who despise me

42:28.947 --> 42:31.180
for the same reason.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.853
Which one are you, Gibbs?

42:39.090 --> 42:41.791
Things are changing.

42:43.562 --> 42:46.129
Can't do it alone.

42:46.131 --> 42:49.098
I've met your team.
