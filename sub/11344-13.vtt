(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.237 --> 00:06.707
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.740 --> 00:09.310
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.343 --> 00:11.212
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.245 --> 00:12.646
are members
of an elite squad

00:12.680 --> 00:14.715
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.748 --> 00:16.684
These are their stories.

00:18.086 --> 00:20.554
Billy Michaels says Mimi Evans
picks her nose.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.823
Ew, that's gross.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.658
She has a booger collection
in her desk.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.460
That's disgusting,
Carly.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.062
And she eats them too.

00:28.096 --> 00:29.363
I don't wanna hear
about it.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.364
Thanks, Mrs. Fennessy.

00:30.398 --> 00:31.365
Wait for me!

00:31.399 --> 00:35.369
Look.
There's a puppy.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.706
We're supposed
to go straight home.

00:38.739 --> 00:41.275
It'll only take a minute.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.745
Come here, boy.

00:44.778 --> 00:48.782
Don't be afraid.
I won't hurt you.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.484
Want some baloney sandwich?

00:56.724 --> 00:58.692
[Carly screams]

00:58.726 --> 01:01.229
Help me!

01:01.262 --> 01:03.864
Someone help me! Aah!

01:03.897 --> 01:06.534
Help! Help!

01:06.567 --> 01:08.402
Stop! Put her down!

01:08.436 --> 01:10.404
Help!
Help!

01:19.447 --> 01:21.349
I saw the license plate.

01:21.382 --> 01:23.717
The first three numbers
were 2-1-0.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.519
I know, sweetie,
the police officer told me.

01:25.553 --> 01:26.520
You did great.

01:26.554 --> 01:28.722
But now I need you to tell me
about your friend.

01:28.756 --> 01:29.857
(crossing guard)
Her name is Carly Hunter.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.592
She's eight.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.194
Parents let her
walk home alone?

01:33.227 --> 01:34.262
Our mom said it's okay

01:34.295 --> 01:36.597
because we live
right down the block.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.432
That's our building.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.833
I take the girls

01:39.867 --> 01:42.836
across 93rd and then
it's a block to their home.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.172
Would you recognize the man?

01:44.205 --> 01:46.140
He was wearing
a Halloween mask.

01:46.174 --> 01:49.210
Mrs. Hunter,
I'm so sorry.

01:49.243 --> 01:50.844
You were right there.
Why didn't you stop him?

01:50.878 --> 01:52.813
No, no. It's nobody's fault.

01:52.846 --> 01:54.582
Do you have
a recent picture of Carly?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.517
Yes.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.618
And witnesses got
the van's plate number,

01:57.651 --> 01:59.387
and we've put out
an Amber Alert.

01:59.420 --> 02:04.625
Here...well, this was taken
last month.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.793
I'll get it out
on the wire.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.428
This is Elliot Stabler.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.330
He'll be the lead detective
on your daughter's case.

02:09.363 --> 02:10.431
Where is Carly's father now?

02:10.464 --> 02:11.432
At work.

02:11.465 --> 02:12.433
Manhattan Liberty Bank.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.734
He manages the branch
on Broadway.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.568
I need to call him.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.770
We'll send somebody
to pick him up.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.806
(Fin)
Witness saw
the van three blocks away!

02:18.839 --> 02:21.141
Said they heard
someone inside.

02:28.949 --> 02:30.918
Police! You, in the van,
come out with your hands

02:30.951 --> 02:32.253
where I can see them!

02:32.286 --> 02:33.254
(man in van)
Don't shoot.

02:33.287 --> 02:35.956
Open the door slowly!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.359
Don't kill me, please.
Don't kill me.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.427
She's not here!

02:39.460 --> 02:40.794
Where's the girl?
What girl?

02:40.828 --> 02:42.796
The door was open.
I got in to get warm.

02:42.830 --> 02:44.798
Captain.

02:48.902 --> 02:53.941
Is that blood?
What did he do to my baby?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.902
Mrs. Hunter,
you gotta stay strong.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.437
Keep thinking positive.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.505
But there was
so much blood.

03:57.538 --> 03:58.772
It may not be Carly's.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.741
What if it is?
My baby's hurt.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.510
She needs help.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.645
Let's go inside now.
Come on.

04:06.980 --> 04:10.884
Jake.
Oh, thank God you're here.

04:10.918 --> 04:14.322
I'm Jake Hunter,
Carly's father.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.424
Honey, why don't you wait
for me upstairs, okay?

04:16.457 --> 04:17.791
I don't wanna
be alone right now.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.760
I'll go with you.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.863
It's okay.

04:22.896 --> 04:25.399
Tell me everything.

04:25.433 --> 04:28.302
The van used to abduct Carly
was stolen last night.

04:28.336 --> 04:30.504
We're processing it right now
for forensic evidence.

04:30.538 --> 04:31.539
Hopefully we'll find something

04:31.572 --> 04:32.806
that leads us to our guy.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.642
You think he's a pedophile.

04:34.675 --> 04:37.345
We don't know that right now.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.347
When I think about what
he could be doing to her--
Mr. Hunter, listen to me.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.450
You cannot allow those images
to get into your head.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.385
Elliot.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.586
Why don't you go upstairs?
Check on your wife.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.654
I'll be up in a while.

04:46.687 --> 04:49.523
Yeah.

04:49.557 --> 04:51.925
Craig Lennon from Parole
just called in.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.328
One of his sex offenders
was rousted last month

04:54.362 --> 04:56.430
sitting in a parked car
outside Carly's school.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.466
He's on his way
to pick up the guy now.

05:01.769 --> 05:03.437
(man)
His name's Joel Mayder.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.906
He did nine years at Sing Sing
for molesting two nieces

05:05.939 --> 05:07.375
and the girl next door.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.343
I always figured
he had more victims.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.511
He ever abduct?

05:10.544 --> 05:12.446
No, but I'd buy him
for a stranger kidnap.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.716
He's smart enough now not
to abuse kids who can ID him.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.020
[knocks on door]

05:20.053 --> 05:22.990
Parole, Mayder!
Open the door!

05:23.023 --> 05:25.393
Now!

05:25.426 --> 05:27.327
There's somebody in there.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.998
Police!
He's going up!

05:55.556 --> 05:57.525
Police! Stop!

05:57.558 --> 05:59.860
Mayder!
We just wanna talk to you.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.838
Come on.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.173
Okay.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.608
(Stabler)
Don't!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.481
[screaming]

06:20.514 --> 06:23.751
[loud crash]

06:29.557 --> 06:31.859
We're screwed
unless something here tells us

06:31.892 --> 06:35.095
where he stashed Carly.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.897
He have access
to anyplace else, you know,

06:36.930 --> 06:38.432
through work, family?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.601
His mother died
while he was inside.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.570
He hadn't found
a job yet.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.005
His brother's
in a hospice dying of cancer.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.641
Got something here.

06:47.675 --> 06:50.678
Laptop.

06:53.981 --> 06:57.985
Check that out.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.587
(Lennon)
He was shopping
for his next victim.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.491
None of these girls
are Carly.

07:03.524 --> 07:05.125
Got a file here
named Journal.

07:07.628 --> 07:10.564
Password protected.

07:10.598 --> 07:13.066
My six-year-old
could hack this.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.102
I'm in.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.539
"Ah, another day of searching.
Still nothing.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.140
"She must be out there,
the special girl,

07:20.173 --> 07:21.942
"the perfect One,
but no sign of her yet.

07:21.975 --> 07:24.545
I try not to lose heart,
but some days I get so lonely."

07:24.578 --> 07:28.482
Dated today.

07:28.516 --> 07:32.119
Look, if Mayder snatched Carly,
why didn't he write about it?

07:32.152 --> 07:33.687
He's not our guy.

07:33.721 --> 07:36.189
Elliot, he could be
covering his tracks.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.659
He knows that we can search
his apartment.

07:38.692 --> 07:39.660
That's why he ran.

07:39.693 --> 07:41.562
I'll search through the photos
on the laptop

07:41.595 --> 07:43.964
to see if I can find any photos
of Carly or the school.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.166
All right, that'll help,
but we need the ME to find

07:46.199 --> 07:48.736
Mayder's DNA in that van.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.270
The only DNA I found
was Carly's.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.740
The blood in the van
was all hers, not Mayder's.

07:52.773 --> 07:55.075
There's no way to know
if Mayder was my perp.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.578
I wanted to give
the Hunters some good news.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.581
Well, there is some news
about the blood.

08:00.614 --> 08:04.117
I found cilia--nosehairs--
in the sample.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
She had a nosebleed.

08:05.886 --> 08:07.087
So Carly might still
be alive.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.121
Yes.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.558
But she's really sick,
Elliot.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.125
Sick with what?

08:12.159 --> 08:14.662
Leukemia.

08:14.695 --> 08:17.197
On the right
are normal blood cells.

08:17.230 --> 08:20.300
On the left are Carly's.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.671
She has too many
white blood cells.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.706
So what does that mean?

08:25.739 --> 08:28.041
With treatment Carly has
a good chance of survival.

08:28.075 --> 08:31.178
But you gotta find her.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.146
Why didn't her parents
say anything?

08:33.180 --> 08:35.716
If this is
her first blast crisis,

08:35.749 --> 08:37.050
the symptoms
would mimic the flu.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.053
Minor aches, low energy,
slight fever.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.689
They probably don't know.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.891
Well, you gotta explain it to me
so I can tell them.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.293
You keep looking
for Carly.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.728
I'll go see the Hunters.

08:51.131 --> 08:52.666
(Pamela)
For the past six weeks

08:52.700 --> 08:56.003
Carly complained
about being tired.

08:56.036 --> 09:00.007
But I just thought she wanted
to stay home from school.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.109
How soon does she have
to start the treatment?

09:02.142 --> 09:03.343
As soon as possible.

09:03.376 --> 09:05.312
But a few days,
even a week,

09:05.345 --> 09:06.780
probably won't make
a difference.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.015
A week?

09:09.950 --> 09:13.987
[phone ringing]

09:14.021 --> 09:17.357
The police are doing
everything they can.

09:17.390 --> 09:22.730
(Jake)
Hello.
Hello, hello.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.035
Who's calling?

09:30.671 --> 09:33.774
(mechanical voice on phone)
We have your daughter.

09:33.807 --> 09:34.775
Oh, God.

09:34.808 --> 09:36.777
(Jake)
What do you want?

09:36.810 --> 09:40.981
(mechanical voice)
Wait for instructions.

09:41.014 --> 09:45.152
If you call the police,
we will kill her.

09:45.185 --> 09:47.187
[dial tone hums]

09:56.396 --> 09:58.298
Why doesn't he call back?
It's been hours.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.299
He will.

09:59.332 --> 10:00.801
How can you be so sure?

10:00.834 --> 10:01.802
He wants money.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.171
The only way he can get it
is by contacting you.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.907
I still think we should
call Detective Stabler.

10:06.940 --> 10:09.643
No, you heard
what the guy said, no cops.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.712
I'm not taking any chances
with my daughter's life.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.313
It's dangerous
to handle this by yourself.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.115
The police are trained--
If they're so smart,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.317
why didn't they have
a tap on our phone?

10:17.350 --> 10:18.719
They thought they were dealing
with a pedophile,

10:18.752 --> 10:19.753
not a ransom kidnap.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.188
All he wants is money,
all right?

10:21.221 --> 10:23.757
If we give it to him,
we'll get Carly back.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.392
You don't know what he'll do.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.727
Let the police handle this.

10:26.760 --> 10:32.065
My daughter,
my choice.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.333
[phone rings]

10:33.366 --> 10:35.803
No, use
the speaker phone.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.037
If I can hear
Carly's voice,

10:37.070 --> 10:39.406
I might be able
to tell how she is.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.275
[ringing]

10:42.309 --> 10:43.376
Hello.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.412
Hello, are you there?

10:45.445 --> 10:47.447
(kidnapper)
I said no cops.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.183
We didn't call them.
I swear.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.152
(kidnapper)
Then who's that woman?

10:52.185 --> 10:55.355
He can see us.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.430
Hundreds of apartments
can see us.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.298
More if he's
using binoculars.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.200
(kidnapper)
Keep them open.

11:09.970 --> 11:13.406
You think I'm gonna let you
sneak the cops in there?

11:13.440 --> 11:16.309
Now tell me who that woman is.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.279
She's a doctor.

11:19.312 --> 11:23.150
I'm here because Carly's sick.
She has leukemia.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.152
(kidnapper)
Do you think I'm stupid?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.220
It's the truth.

11:30.057 --> 11:34.194
(kidnapper)
Prove it.

11:34.227 --> 11:37.898
Talk to me like I'm a doctor.

11:42.836 --> 11:46.373
Carly has acute
lymphocytic leukemia,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.275
characterized
by a profound increase

11:48.308 --> 11:52.079
in the white blood cells that
resemble immature lymphoblasts.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.915
She needs to be hospitalized
immediately

11:54.948 --> 11:57.384
for induction chemotherapy.

12:02.389 --> 12:07.527
(kidnapper)
No one else comes in.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.695
We will be watching.

12:08.728 --> 12:16.069
Mr. Hunter, leave now
and come back with $300,000.

12:16.103 --> 12:20.841
You have until 8:00 tonight
or Carly dies.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.977
We'll do whatever you want.
Just don't hurt her.

12:24.011 --> 12:29.282
Can we talk
to Carly, please?

12:29.316 --> 12:33.420
(Carly)
Mommy?
I wanna come home.

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
Sweetheart.

12:35.488 --> 12:37.390
How do you feel?

12:37.424 --> 12:39.526
[dial tone hums]

12:39.559 --> 12:40.427
No!

12:40.460 --> 12:42.429
We'll get her back.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.331
We don't have
that kind of money.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.866
I'll cash out
the college fund and the CDs.

12:45.899 --> 12:46.867
I'm going
to the bank.

12:46.900 --> 12:50.537
Jake!

12:50.570 --> 12:53.273
Pamela, where's
your bathroom?

12:53.306 --> 12:57.177
Down the hall.
First door on your left.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.518
[dialing]

13:12.225 --> 13:18.999
Elliot, it's Melinda.
We have a situation.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.000
Set her down.

13:20.033 --> 13:23.470
Easy, easy.
I got it.

13:23.503 --> 13:25.438
Got a delivery
for Mrs. Grossman.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.542
3C, but you gotta use
the service entrance.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.553
Sight lines
we need to avoid?

13:40.587 --> 13:42.990
You got the kitchen windows
frosted.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.058
The hallway and Carly's room
are your safe zones.

13:45.092 --> 13:47.928
Every other room
can be seen from outside.

13:52.265 --> 13:53.967
Set up on the counter
in there.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.135
Come with me.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.604
Grab your coat.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.571
Why did you do this?

13:58.605 --> 13:59.907
Shhh.
Shhh.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.612
We're sweeping
for bugs.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.017
Hold this close to your chest
and walk through every room.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.119
Then come back.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.221
He will kill my daughter
if he sees you.
He won't.

14:14.254 --> 14:16.056
We're a couple of guys
who delivered a fridge.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.457
Two came in,
two will now leave.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.092
We're good to go.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.628
I'll call you if we find
anything on the search.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.963
What search?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.064
We're checking
all the buildings

14:24.097 --> 14:25.665
the guy could be using
to watch us.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.567
Look, you can't.
He'll know.

14:27.600 --> 14:30.170
He won't.
Trust me.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.505
He won't suspect a nanny
and a stroller,

14:32.539 --> 14:34.541
a gas man, FedEx...

14:34.574 --> 14:36.076
(Morales)
We're clear.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.545
Wherever he is,
he's only got visuals.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.147
As long as they stay
in the kitchen,

14:40.180 --> 14:42.615
he'll never know they're here,
and Carly will be safe.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.850
Okay.
Okay.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.519
Now I need you up on the phone
lines before he calls back.

14:46.553 --> 14:47.320
Where's your
telephone junction box?

14:47.354 --> 14:51.058
In the service hallway
to the right.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.927
Get anything off
the phone records?

14:53.961 --> 14:56.063
Each call was made from
a different pre-paid cell phone.

14:56.096 --> 14:57.630
He used 'em once,
and dumped 'em.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.033
Can you track
the voice-altering device?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.569
You can buy those things
in any electronics store.

15:02.602 --> 15:05.538
Jake's back.

15:05.572 --> 15:10.010
Don't tell him anything.
Just bring him on in here.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.211
(Jake)
I got the cash.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.113
Let's talk
in the kitchen.

15:16.483 --> 15:19.052
How could you do this?
He said no cops.

15:19.086 --> 15:20.320
He will kill
our child.

15:20.353 --> 15:21.721
Mr. Hunter, I'm only here

15:21.754 --> 15:24.424
because we both want
the same thing, Carly's return.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.692
I'm gonna give
the guy his money.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.094
He's gonna give me
my daughter.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.528
And you're not
gonna stop me.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.562
I don't wanna stop you.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.664
I just wanna make sure
when you make that exchange,

15:31.698 --> 15:34.201
everyone is safe,
that's all.

15:34.234 --> 15:38.138
All right.

15:38.171 --> 15:39.339
Recorders
and tracing devices

15:39.372 --> 15:42.109
are in place
on the phone lines.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.143
What now?

15:43.176 --> 15:47.047
We wait for him to call.

15:47.080 --> 15:52.019
It's dark.
Carly must be scared.

15:52.052 --> 15:57.290
She's never spent
one night away from home.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.626
Mr. Hunter, this wasn't
a random crime.

15:59.659 --> 16:02.462
Somebody chose Carly.

16:02.495 --> 16:07.167
Targeted you.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.036
He knows your name,
he knows your phone number,

16:09.069 --> 16:11.671
where you live.

16:11.704 --> 16:13.773
That you have money.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.709
We're not rich.
I'm only a bank manager.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.778
Is anyone angry with you?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.748
Threatened your family?

16:21.781 --> 16:25.485
No.

16:25.518 --> 16:28.488
You're sure?

16:28.521 --> 16:35.095
If I knew who had
my little girl, I'd tell you.

16:35.128 --> 16:37.130
[phone rings]

16:41.268 --> 16:43.070
Hello!
[fax machine turns on]

16:43.103 --> 16:44.771
Where's your fax machine?

16:44.804 --> 16:47.240
It's in my office.

16:47.274 --> 16:50.543
(Pamela)
Is it from him?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.611
What does it say?

16:51.644 --> 16:54.247
"Go to the garage now.
Put the money in the trunk."

16:54.281 --> 16:55.448
He knows we have a car?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.250
He must have seen us
drive in and out.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.686
Well, maybe someone saw him.
Is there a garage attendant?

16:59.719 --> 17:00.820
Security cameras?
No.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.822
"Drive to 98th
and West End.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.425
"There's a cell phone in a bag
under a dumpster.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.760
"Find it,
and press redial.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.797
We'll tell you
where to drive."

17:10.830 --> 17:14.167
You better read this.

17:14.201 --> 17:15.802
(Stabler)
"The doc brings
the money alone."

17:15.835 --> 17:17.804
No way.
You're not doing this.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.038
I can take care of myself.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.708
Look, no offense, but med school
doesn't exactly prepare you

17:21.741 --> 17:23.510
for something like this.

17:23.543 --> 17:24.544
The Air Force did.

17:24.577 --> 17:27.080
They paid for medical school.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.782
I did two tours at Ramstein
during Desert Storm.

17:29.816 --> 17:32.719
I know how to handle myself
around men with guns.

17:38.725 --> 17:43.196
Take this.
Take it.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.400
It'll be okay.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.712
[beeping]

17:59.746 --> 18:01.748
[line rings]

18:06.886 --> 18:08.355
(kidnapper)
What's up, Doc?

18:08.388 --> 18:09.889
Where to?

18:09.922 --> 18:10.757
(kidnapper)
Head for the river.

18:10.790 --> 18:14.394
Go south
on the West Side Highway.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.673
I'm at the piers.
Now what?

18:26.706 --> 18:31.144
(kidnapper)
Take the money out
of the trunk...and wait.

19:07.880 --> 19:08.948
Now walk.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.518
Not until I see Carly.

19:11.551 --> 19:13.186
(kidnapper)
You do what I say,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.822
and you will.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.863
That's far enough.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.365
Hey, sit up.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.936
Now put the money down

19:29.969 --> 19:31.938
and go back to the car.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.712
What are you, deaf?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.781
I said go back to the car!

19:41.814 --> 19:43.950
Not without the girl.

19:43.983 --> 19:46.919
Look, you got your money.
It's all right there.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.821
Just let me take her home,
and everybody's happy.

19:48.855 --> 19:49.822
You stop.
All right?

19:49.856 --> 19:50.957
No-no-no, stop!

19:54.994 --> 19:55.962
It's all right, sweetheart.
Come on!

19:55.995 --> 19:57.530
Come over to me.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.399
I'll take you
to your mommy and daddy.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.400
No, stop, stop.

20:00.433 --> 20:01.668
(security guard)
Hey!

20:01.701 --> 20:03.636
This is private property!
There's no trespassing!

20:03.670 --> 20:05.238
Get in the car!

20:05.272 --> 20:07.307
No, wait!
Sit down!

20:07.340 --> 20:09.876
Let her out! Let her out,
you bastard! Let her out!

20:09.909 --> 20:10.877
Out!

20:10.910 --> 20:11.911
Stay down!

20:28.628 --> 20:29.962
(Stabler)
The security guard here
boned us.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.698
(Cragen)
He was doing his job.

20:31.731 --> 20:33.500
Look, the taker knows
we're in on it now.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.767
He could cut his losses,
kill Carly,

20:34.801 --> 20:36.035
and just walk away
from it all.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.804
He's not gonna walk away
from all this money.

20:37.837 --> 20:38.838
Captain!

20:38.871 --> 20:40.773
Tell me you got something.
Maybe.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.842
What's that?
Pebbles?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.944
Sodium chloride.

20:44.977 --> 20:45.745
Rock salt,
like for melting ice.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.747
I found it where
the car was parked

20:47.780 --> 20:48.948
and in the skid marks.

20:48.981 --> 20:50.550
The tire treads
must've been full of it.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.584
Tires didn't pick up
all this salt

20:51.618 --> 20:53.453
just driving
down the street.

20:53.486 --> 20:54.787
You thinking our guy
was hanging out at a plant

20:54.821 --> 20:55.955
that makes that stuff?
It's possible.

20:55.988 --> 20:57.757
Different de-icers
use slightly different

20:57.790 --> 20:58.825
chemical compounds.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.961
I'll check out manufacturers
in the tri-state area.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.963
Keep us posted.

21:03.996 --> 21:06.866
We gotta tell Carly's parents
what happened.

21:06.899 --> 21:07.967
You told me to trust you.

21:08.000 --> 21:08.835
You said you'd
bring my daughter back.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.770
This is our only chance,
and you blew it.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.406
Jake, stop it!

21:13.440 --> 21:16.809
Did Carly look all right?
Healthy, I mean.

21:16.843 --> 21:17.910
She seemed fine.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.879
Did she say anything?

21:19.912 --> 21:21.448
There wasn't time.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.849
(Jake)
So we're right back
where we started.

21:22.882 --> 21:26.018
Not exactly.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.625
We're not dealing
with a professional here.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.694
How do you know?

21:34.727 --> 21:36.596
A pro wouldn't have been rattled
by some rent-a-cop.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.097
He woulda made sure
he got the money

21:38.130 --> 21:39.366
and made a clean getaway.

21:39.399 --> 21:42.669
So what are you saying?

21:42.702 --> 21:44.971
Something you're
not telling me?

21:50.477 --> 21:52.945
You having an affair?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.915
Got gambling problems?
No, no.
Nothing like that.

21:55.948 --> 21:57.984
I don't know why someone
would wanna hurt me.

21:58.017 --> 21:59.085
How about your wife?

21:59.118 --> 22:00.687
We've been married
since we were kids.

22:00.720 --> 22:04.591
We got no secrets.

22:04.624 --> 22:06.993
So what do we do now,
we just sit and wait?

22:07.026 --> 22:09.396
We're going
to go after him.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.863
Well, how?

22:10.897 --> 22:14.901
He's given us
two leads.

22:14.934 --> 22:17.604
Forensics evidence from the
warehouse and the ransom note.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.110
(Cragen)
He masked the location
he sent the fax from.

22:24.143 --> 22:25.912
We still may be able
to track it down.

22:25.945 --> 22:26.913
Take a look.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.481
(Cragen)
What is that?

22:28.515 --> 22:30.049
(Morales)
A microscopic tracking code.

22:30.082 --> 22:32.885
Manufacturers started putting
them into top of the line

22:32.919 --> 22:34.887
color printers and copiers at
the request of the government.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.922
What do they tell you?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.924
Serial number
of the device used

22:37.957 --> 22:40.493
to print the documents,
plus date and time.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.094
I can look up the location
of the printer

22:42.128 --> 22:43.162
on the Secret Service
database.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.597
Secret Service?

22:44.631 --> 22:46.466
They claim it's an
anti-counterfeiting measure.

22:46.499 --> 22:48.801
(Stabler)
The tracking code still comes
through on a fax?

22:48.835 --> 22:51.804
Wherever ink was printed on the
original paper it's still there.

22:51.838 --> 22:54.907
Even if it's microscopic.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.008
Got it.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.878
The ransom note was printed
and faxed from a copy shop

22:58.911 --> 22:59.879
on 86th and Broadway.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.881
Here's the copy shop.

23:03.983 --> 23:07.186
Give me that.
Will ya?

23:07.219 --> 23:10.957
Carly's school,
the Hunters' apartment.

23:10.990 --> 23:13.960
The van used to snatch Carly
was stolen from here.

23:13.993 --> 23:17.764
And the ransom drop
is right there.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.566
(Cragen)
It's all up and down
the West Side,

23:19.599 --> 23:21.901
along the river
within a one-mile stretch.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.035
It's his comfort zone.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.538
Carly has gotta be stashed
within that perimeter.

23:25.572 --> 23:26.606
And I think I know where.

23:26.639 --> 23:28.541
One of the companies
that used to make rock salt

23:28.575 --> 23:30.042
went out of business,
but they had a storage yard

23:30.076 --> 23:31.043
on 58th street.

23:31.077 --> 23:36.082
On the Hudson River.

23:36.115 --> 23:40.987
This has gotta be
the place.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.093
There's no sign
of the car.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.562
Maybe he put it
in there.

24:02.875 --> 24:04.877
Door's open, Captain!

24:04.911 --> 24:06.546
(Cragen)
Elliot.

24:06.579 --> 24:07.980
Elliot, this padlock is new.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.062
(Stabler)
Carly.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.269
I'm not getting a pulse.

24:30.302 --> 24:33.005
Carly.
Carly.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.073
Carly!

24:34.106 --> 24:35.542
Cold syrup.
The bastard drugged her.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.646
Carly, you gotta wake up, honey!

24:39.679 --> 24:41.213
Let's get her to the hospital.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.150
She's stable for now.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.753
We treated her for hypothermia
and the overdose.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.054
She'll sleep through the night,

24:48.087 --> 24:51.724
and we'll start her chemo
in the morning.

24:51.758 --> 24:54.994
Oh, God.
Oh, hi, baby.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.564
(Jake)
Hey, Peanut.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.166
(Pamela)
Mommy missed you so much.

25:12.144 --> 25:13.846
I'll stay with her.

25:13.880 --> 25:14.947
You heard the doc.

25:14.981 --> 25:17.049
She's gonna be out
of it till morning.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.185
Why don't you go home,
get a little sleep?

25:19.218 --> 25:22.221
[sighs]

25:31.931 --> 25:35.034
Hey, congratulations.
I hear you found Carly.
Yeah.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.904
The guy's still
out there, though.

25:37.937 --> 25:40.106
You'll get him.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.608
You going home?

25:41.641 --> 25:45.612
Yeah, I gotta get
some stuff out of my locker.

25:45.645 --> 25:48.581
See ya in the morning.

25:48.615 --> 25:51.951
Good night.

26:28.688 --> 26:32.224
Hey, Carly.

26:32.258 --> 26:35.294
It's okay, honey.
This is Elliot.

26:35.327 --> 26:37.930
He's the one
who found you.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.265
Thank you.

26:39.298 --> 26:40.299
(Stabler)
You're welcome.

26:40.332 --> 26:43.169
How you feeling?

26:43.202 --> 26:44.871
Can I sit down here
and ask you a few questions?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.073
Yeah.

26:50.977 --> 26:55.915
The man who took you,
did you ever see his face?

26:55.948 --> 26:59.051
No, he always
had that mask on.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.053
Did he ever talk to you?

27:01.087 --> 27:03.255
I don't remember.

27:03.289 --> 27:08.260
I was really sleepy.
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.129
Do you remember
anything about him?

27:10.162 --> 27:12.298
He was nice.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.001
He didn't yell at me.

27:15.034 --> 27:16.903
And he made me chocofizzies.

27:16.936 --> 27:20.339
What's a chocofizzie?

27:20.372 --> 27:22.909
When Carly was little
she hated milk.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.311
We used to mix it with
chocolate syrup and seltzer.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.714
My big brother
called it a chocofizzie.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.955
Thanks.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.260
You have another child?

27:41.293 --> 27:45.131
Daniel.
He's 23.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.132
But we haven't seen him

27:46.165 --> 27:48.234
in five years.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.236
You never mentioned him.

27:53.239 --> 27:55.374
Daniel did this.

27:55.407 --> 27:56.809
He took Carly.

27:56.843 --> 27:58.044
Why?

27:58.077 --> 27:59.345
Daniel's a cocaine addict.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.714
We tried counseling,
boot camp, rehab.

28:01.748 --> 28:02.715
Nothing worked.

28:02.749 --> 28:04.751
When Carly was three,
she went into his bedroom

28:04.784 --> 28:05.952
and found his stash.

28:05.985 --> 28:10.089
I walked in just as she was
putting the drugs in her mouth.

28:10.122 --> 28:13.325
He almost killed his sister, and
he was so high he didn't care.

28:13.359 --> 28:14.927
I knew as long
as he lived with us

28:14.961 --> 28:16.963
that Carly was never
gonna be safe.

28:16.996 --> 28:18.831
So you kicked him out?

28:18.865 --> 28:20.967
We had to make a choice.
Daniel was 18.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.935
We couldn't save him,
so we cut him out of our lives.

28:25.171 --> 28:26.806
When was the last time
you talked to him?

28:26.839 --> 28:29.508
The day he left.

28:29.541 --> 28:36.215
You may think I'm cold.
I love my son.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.284
I hate the junkie he's become.

28:38.317 --> 28:41.754
But I cannot help him.
I cannot make him better.

28:44.490 --> 28:46.092
Where's your husband right now?

28:46.125 --> 28:49.261
He had to go to work.
He'll be back soon.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.331
Okay, no.
I'll go to the bank.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.966
How's Carly?

28:54.000 --> 28:54.967
She's okay.

28:55.001 --> 28:56.969
What do you know
about families and addiction?

28:57.003 --> 28:58.871
I did a rotation
at a methadone clinic.

28:58.905 --> 29:01.273
I may need your help. I'll
explain it to you on the way.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.412
(Jake)
Detective Stabler.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.881
Is something wrong?
Is Carly okay?

29:08.915 --> 29:10.516
She's fine, Mr. Hunter,
we just need to speak to you

29:10.549 --> 29:13.052
about your son Daniel.

29:13.085 --> 29:15.855
Why?

29:15.888 --> 29:17.890
We think he may be involved
in Carly's abduction.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.059
You're wrong.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.493
Your wife told us
about his addiction.

29:25.898 --> 29:27.266
My office.

29:27.299 --> 29:30.536
Daniel's a good kid.
The drugs screwed him up.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.171
But he'd never hurt his sister.

29:32.204 --> 29:33.572
Cocaine changes people.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.008
You never stopped talking
to Daniel, did you?

29:36.042 --> 29:38.044
He calls me at work.

29:38.077 --> 29:40.146
Pamela
doesn't know.

29:40.179 --> 29:44.183
I couldn't cut him off.
He's still my son.

29:44.216 --> 29:46.152
When was the last time
you did talk to him?

29:46.185 --> 29:48.320
(Jake)
Two weeks ago.
He said he was in trouble.

29:48.354 --> 29:49.956
Sounded scared.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.958
And he asked for money.

29:51.991 --> 29:55.127
I've helped him before.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.930
But he asked for so much,
Pamela would have found out.

29:57.964 --> 30:00.532
And I told Daniel
I couldn't give it to him.

30:05.071 --> 30:06.939
This is--this is all my fault.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.842
[gunfire erupts]

30:13.412 --> 30:15.114
Get over here!
And no alarms.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.316
Where are you going?
Come here!

30:17.349 --> 30:20.086
Everybody down
on the floor now!

30:20.119 --> 30:23.155
Get over there now!
Do it!

30:23.189 --> 30:25.892
You got your PDA?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.426
Yeah.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.095
Get Cragen.

30:29.128 --> 30:32.932
Now everybody,
heads down on the ground!

30:32.965 --> 30:36.202
Get on the floor now!

30:36.235 --> 30:39.171
I said get down on the floor!

30:39.205 --> 30:42.608
I said get down!

30:44.476 --> 30:46.979
Daniel.

31:02.528 --> 31:06.165
All right, I want everybody
to stay down.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.466
Daniel, what are you doing?

31:07.499 --> 31:09.368
I said get on the floor, Dad!

31:09.401 --> 31:11.570
(Jake)
Are you really gonna shoot me?

31:11.603 --> 31:15.141
Maybe.

31:15.174 --> 31:17.076
Maybe I'll shoot her.

31:17.109 --> 31:20.512
Please, no!
Okay, okay.

31:20.546 --> 31:21.914
All right.
Okay?

31:21.948 --> 31:24.350
(Daniel)
Good. Good.

31:32.391 --> 31:35.327
I want you to go to the vault
and get the money.

31:35.361 --> 31:38.364
(teller)
Whatever you want.
Just don't shoot.

31:38.397 --> 31:41.300
Put the cash in those bags.

31:41.333 --> 31:42.668
None of those dye packs.

31:42.701 --> 31:45.904
[baby crying]

31:49.141 --> 31:50.509
Could you shut that kid up!

31:50.542 --> 31:53.579
Please don't!

31:53.612 --> 31:56.248
All right.

31:56.282 --> 31:57.249
Stay down.
Especially you.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.085
You keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

31:59.118 --> 32:00.086
(man)
Okay, okay.

32:00.119 --> 32:02.521
No, don't shoot him!

32:02.554 --> 32:03.555
[screams]

32:07.259 --> 32:09.528
All right, who's back there?

32:09.561 --> 32:11.463
(Jake)
Detective Stabler
and Dr. Warner.

32:11.497 --> 32:14.967
Give me a gun.

32:15.001 --> 32:18.370
Detective, I want you to slide
your gun out the door.

32:18.404 --> 32:21.473
Now!

32:21.507 --> 32:23.375
Do it, or I'll kill
everybody in here!

32:23.409 --> 32:27.113
I swear to God I will.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.384
Now get out here!

32:32.418 --> 32:34.520
Don't shoot.
We're coming out!

32:49.668 --> 32:50.569
Daniel, I'm Elliot.

32:50.602 --> 32:53.005
Shut up. Just shut
the hell up, all right?

32:53.039 --> 32:54.640
Get over here.

32:54.673 --> 32:56.542
He's high.

32:56.575 --> 32:57.609
Hurry up!

32:57.643 --> 32:59.478
Hurry up in there!

32:59.511 --> 33:01.147
Turn around.

33:01.180 --> 33:02.348
Why are you doing this?

33:02.381 --> 33:05.184
Oh, like you don't know.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.586
I told you I needed the money
or they were gonna kill me.

33:07.619 --> 33:09.288
Who was gonna
kill you, Daniel?

33:11.623 --> 33:13.459
I owe some guys
a lot of dough.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.462
I don't pay them,
and I'm a dead man.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.331
But you, you wouldn't help me
because you don't give a damn!

33:19.365 --> 33:20.532
Yes, I do.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.768
You threw me out
on the street.

33:22.801 --> 33:24.436
I had nowhere to go.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.538
We sent you to rehab.
You ran away.

33:26.572 --> 33:30.776
You only care about Carly.
Hurry up with the money!

33:30.809 --> 33:32.644
Your mother and I
both love you very much, Daniel.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.481
Why wouldn't you help me?
Why?

33:35.514 --> 33:37.349
I needed the money.

33:37.383 --> 33:40.086
I asked you for the money
to save my life.

33:40.119 --> 33:41.387
I mean, you paid for Carly,

33:41.420 --> 33:42.488
but you wouldn't pay
for your son.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.523
Here's the money.

33:44.556 --> 33:46.692
Put it down.

33:53.665 --> 33:56.535
You made me do this.

33:56.568 --> 34:00.106
You gave me no choice.
Come on.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.275
Turn around.

34:03.309 --> 34:06.478
(man)
He's coming out.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.514
[guns cocking]

34:12.284 --> 34:13.552
I can take him out.

34:13.585 --> 34:15.287
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

34:15.321 --> 34:18.490
Hold your fire!

34:21.893 --> 34:23.229
Inside.

34:24.763 --> 34:26.832
Damn it.

34:26.865 --> 34:30.068
[gunfire blares]

34:36.475 --> 34:39.478
[groans]

34:41.647 --> 34:43.882
Stay with me, Jake.
Stay with me.

34:43.915 --> 34:46.285
We got gunfire.
We may have casualties.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.686
There's no time
to talk this guy down.

34:47.719 --> 34:49.488
I'm in command here.
We do it my way.

34:49.521 --> 34:51.323
Daniel Hunter
is a scared kid.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.524
Yeah, with a Mac-10,
high on coke,

34:52.558 --> 34:54.126
and holding a dozen hostages.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.327
Exactly, he's in
over his head

34:55.361 --> 34:56.328
looking for a way out.

34:56.362 --> 34:57.529
I can give it to him.

34:57.563 --> 34:58.764
Well, we need to make an entry.

34:58.797 --> 35:00.166
(Cragen)
There are no windows.

35:00.199 --> 35:01.567
The walls are
too thick for sensors.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.834
You'd be going in blind.

35:02.868 --> 35:06.472
Shock and awe.
We have the building plans.

35:06.505 --> 35:08.140
There's unreinforced wall
right here.

35:08.174 --> 35:09.608
We smash through it
with an armored vehicle,

35:09.641 --> 35:11.510
roll in a few flash bangs,
the guy's down

35:11.543 --> 35:12.511
before he knows
what's happening.

35:12.544 --> 35:13.579
What if he's not
in the main lobby?

35:13.612 --> 35:14.780
What if he's in the vault?

35:14.813 --> 35:16.248
You go inside,
you risk the lives

35:16.282 --> 35:19.518
of everybody in that bank,
civilians and my people.

35:19.551 --> 35:21.387
Hardline's ready, Captain.

35:21.420 --> 35:22.621
Patch me through.

35:25.691 --> 35:28.660
[phone rings]

35:28.694 --> 35:31.530
Nobody answers that!

35:31.563 --> 35:35.567
It's a negotiator, Daniel.
You can tell him what you want.

35:35.601 --> 35:37.236
I don't know what I want.

35:37.269 --> 35:41.640
So let's figure it out together.
Go ahead, pick it up.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.774
I don't know.
You answer it.

35:42.808 --> 35:44.210
Answer it!

35:44.243 --> 35:47.246
[phone rings]

35:50.549 --> 35:51.617
This is Elliot Stabler.

35:51.650 --> 35:54.586
It's Don.
Is everybody all right?

35:54.620 --> 35:59.658
Jake Hunter's been shot.
He needs an ambulance.

35:59.691 --> 36:03.662
How many civilians in the bank?

36:03.695 --> 36:05.697
Will he let the hostages leave?

36:05.731 --> 36:06.965
No-no-no.
No.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.301
Everybody stays.
They're my ticket outta here.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.702
You don't need them.
You've got me.

36:10.736 --> 36:12.671
I'm a cop.
So is every guy out there.

36:12.704 --> 36:14.306
They're not gonna risk my life.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.942
As long as you're
with me, you're safe.

36:16.975 --> 36:18.344
No, you're just messin'
with my head.

36:18.377 --> 36:19.445
That's what you're doing.

36:19.478 --> 36:25.317
Daniel, listen to me.
Now, your father needs a doctor.

36:25.351 --> 36:26.552
He's got one.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.720
We need to get him
to a hospital.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.693
All right, everybody, up!

36:34.726 --> 36:36.662
The hostages are coming out.
Don't shoot.

36:36.695 --> 36:37.863
We've got civilians exiting.

36:37.896 --> 36:40.566
Team One, right side!
Team Two, left!

36:40.599 --> 36:43.802
Come on, let's go, go, go!

36:43.835 --> 36:47.406
No, you--you, you get
back where you were.

36:47.439 --> 36:48.940
And stay there.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.643
Everyone get out of here.
Go, go.

36:53.745 --> 36:55.714
[over radio]
Team One in position.

36:55.747 --> 36:57.616
Team Two in position.

37:00.652 --> 37:02.754
Right this way, ma'am.
Follow me.

37:02.788 --> 37:04.623
[chatter]

37:04.656 --> 37:05.624
Let's go.

37:05.657 --> 37:07.693
It's okay. Go.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.431
He's lost too much blood.
I can't move him.

37:12.464 --> 37:14.266
Is my dad gonna die?

37:14.300 --> 37:18.404
Dad, I didn't mean to do this.
I--

37:18.437 --> 37:19.871
You go.
I'll keep the pressure.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.640
I told you not to move!

37:21.673 --> 37:24.676
Back up!

37:24.710 --> 37:27.413
He's my patient, Elliot.
I'm not leaving without him.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.382
Okay, we got 'em.

37:30.416 --> 37:32.017
Now let's talk
about how we can help Daniel.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.520
Nobody can help me.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.787
I'm going to jail.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.989
Daniel, we can still
make this right.

37:38.023 --> 37:39.758
What are you
talkin' about?

37:39.791 --> 37:40.859
I shot my dad.

37:40.892 --> 37:43.629
It was an accident.

37:43.662 --> 37:45.631
Yeah, like they're gonna just
let me walk on outta here.

37:45.664 --> 37:46.632
Right?
Hey, Daniel.

37:46.665 --> 37:48.300
You let all those people go.

37:48.334 --> 37:49.335
That's gotta count
for something.

37:49.368 --> 37:51.036
[coughing]

37:51.069 --> 37:53.271
Hey, what's happening to him?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.476
His lungs are collapsing.

37:57.509 --> 37:58.844
Well, do something.

37:58.877 --> 38:00.846
Get me a sharp scissor
and a small tube--

38:00.879 --> 38:03.682
a pen, a straw,
anything like that.

38:03.715 --> 38:06.017
Hang in there, Jake.
Hang in there.

38:06.051 --> 38:07.786
Please don't let him die.
Please.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.055
Please.
Come on.
Come on.

38:10.088 --> 38:11.089
Okay.

38:11.122 --> 38:12.524
Will this do?

38:12.558 --> 38:13.525
It'll do.

38:13.559 --> 38:14.760
(Daniel)
Hurry up!

38:14.793 --> 38:20.499
Daniel, you have
to let me do my job.

38:20.532 --> 38:22.534
[grunts]

38:26.438 --> 38:28.840
Smaller.
Here.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.442
That's it.

38:30.476 --> 38:33.044
[grunts]

38:36.782 --> 38:38.116
Is he gonna be okay?

38:38.149 --> 38:39.718
For now.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.654
But we have
to get him to the hospital.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.055
Daniel, it's time
for this to end.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.826
[sniffs]

38:52.398 --> 38:54.366
I'm sorry, Dad.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.368
I really am.

38:56.402 --> 39:03.475
It's okay.
We're gonna be okay.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.846
[sniffs]

39:07.879 --> 39:09.347
Yeah.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.885
Daniel, stop.

39:19.858 --> 39:22.761
Tell Mom that I love her.

39:29.468 --> 39:30.736
[over radio]
Zero-one in position.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.871
Zero-two awaiting further.

39:35.106 --> 39:37.042
[gunshot from inside the bank]

39:37.075 --> 39:38.477
Daniel!

39:38.510 --> 39:41.547
(officer)
Suspect down, suspect down.

39:41.580 --> 39:42.748
No.

39:42.781 --> 39:44.883
(officer)
Move in, move in!

39:44.916 --> 39:46.452
She just saved his life.

39:47.953 --> 39:49.855
Hands on your head!

39:49.888 --> 39:51.089
Face-down, face-down.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.123
Ah!

40:00.098 --> 40:03.569
Will he
be all right?

40:03.602 --> 40:04.703
He'll be fine.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.773
Thank you.

40:07.806 --> 40:09.040
(Daniel)
Mom.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.946
I don't know what
to say to him.

40:23.188 --> 40:26.558
You okay?
Yeah.

40:28.827 --> 40:33.499
I gotta pick up
my daughter from school.

40:39.104 --> 40:39.170
