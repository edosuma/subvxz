WEBVTT

00:09.224 --> 00:11.215
-Morning, Roz.
- Hey, Frasier.

00:11.476 --> 00:13.831
For you. A little token of thanks.

00:14.104 --> 00:17.335
After you cut those new promos,
Dr Frank on KTLK

00:17.649 --> 00:20.243
practically vanished from the radio.

00:20.527 --> 00:22.518
I'm not good at picking out gifts,

00:22.779 --> 00:26.089
but when I saw this in the window
I knew it was perfect for you.

00:29.369 --> 00:31.758
Maybe I should've gone with the shawl.

00:32.039 --> 00:34.792
It's not the purse.
Although I do hate it.

00:37.044 --> 00:40.320
I don't even know why I'm crying.

00:40.630 --> 00:44.543
It's the pregnancy. A soup of hormones
churns through your body

00:44.885 --> 00:47.274
and your emotions are rising and falling

00:47.554 --> 00:50.671
- at the slightest provocation.
- That's idiotic.

00:50.974 --> 00:55.684
- All right. Is something else going on?
- Last night was a disaster.

00:56.063 --> 00:59.180
- Right, your date.
- Everything was fine

00:59.483 --> 01:02.998
and when he tried to order me a drink
I told him I was pregnant.

01:03.320 --> 01:05.311
You didn't tell him before the date?

01:05.572 --> 01:08.086
It's not the easiest thing
to tell someone.

01:08.367 --> 01:13.157
I was hoping my radiant glow
would do the talking for me.

01:13.538 --> 01:16.689
Your glow?
Roz, do you really think that

01:17.000 --> 01:20.151
anyone could miss your glow?

01:21.088 --> 01:24.842
So, I tell him, and he says fine,
it's not a problem.

01:25.175 --> 01:27.735
Five minutes later
his pager is vibrating.

01:28.011 --> 01:30.400
He has an emergency.
He has to go to work.

01:30.681 --> 01:34.196
- Maybe he was telling the truth.
- He sells wicker furniture.

01:34.518 --> 01:38.716
Who needs their end tables re-caned
at 9.30 at night?

01:44.903 --> 01:47.781
I owe you an apology, Roz,
it's not the hormones.

01:48.073 --> 01:50.587
You're embarking
on a life-changing journey.

01:50.909 --> 01:53.059
Anybody would be emotional.

01:53.328 --> 01:56.525
I think you're handling it beautifully.

01:57.207 --> 01:58.401
Thanks, Frasier.

02:00.502 --> 02:02.811
I'm fine.
I just need to go back to work.

02:05.590 --> 02:07.865
My pen is out of ink.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.110
Let's not discount the hormones
altogether.

02:17.269 --> 02:20.864
Hello, I'd like to return this purse.

02:21.189 --> 02:25.979
I'm terribly sorry but this was a sale
item and we have a no-return policy.

02:26.361 --> 02:29.114
- Your wife didn't like it?
- I'm not married.

02:29.406 --> 02:31.397
- Girlfriend?
- No. No girlfriend.

02:31.658 --> 02:35.287
I don't have time to go into
my other non-existent relationships.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.611
It was a gift for a friend.

02:37.873 --> 02:42.628
Perhaps your "friend" would like to
make it work with some matching shoes.

02:43.003 --> 02:47.235
- We have up to size 13.
- This really was a gift,

02:47.591 --> 02:51.823
and I would thank you when you say
the word "friend" not to italicise it.

02:53.263 --> 02:56.175
Excuse me, sir,
I couldn't help overhearing.

02:56.475 --> 03:00.184
- May I help you out here?
- You hold her down, I can do the rest.

03:01.688 --> 03:04.122
Hopefully, that won't be necessary.

03:07.986 --> 03:10.022
Jill, we're all reasonable people.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.238
Why don't you just
give this gentleman a store credit?

03:13.533 --> 03:15.728
I don't make the rules.

03:15.994 --> 03:19.145
But a shrewd saleswoman such as yourself

03:19.456 --> 03:23.847
knows that this business isn't about
rules. It's about relationships.

03:24.211 --> 03:27.203
Look at this man.
Cultured, impeccably dressed.

03:27.506 --> 03:30.578
The sort of man
you'd love to have a relationship with.

03:30.884 --> 03:34.718
There's one thing standing
in the way of that relationship.

03:35.055 --> 03:38.252
- He's not happy with his purse.
- It's not my purse.

03:38.558 --> 03:42.517
Maybe his purse was the wrong colour.
Maybe it didn't hold enough.

03:42.854 --> 03:45.573
It's not my purse.

03:45.857 --> 03:49.133
If he walks away unhappy,
he may never shop here again.

03:49.444 --> 03:52.242
And who knows what he might have
bought in the future?

03:52.531 --> 03:56.968
Scarves, gloves, hosiery.
The choice is yours, Jill.

03:57.327 --> 04:00.763
The commissions that come
from a lifelong relationship,

04:01.081 --> 04:05.871
or the hollow satisfaction
of knowing you followed the rules?

04:07.337 --> 04:09.976
OK, I'll go get the forms.

04:13.010 --> 04:15.729
Thank you. That was very impressive.

04:16.012 --> 04:20.564
You should see me return
something hard like a house or a kidney.

04:20.934 --> 04:22.925
The secret is persistence.

04:23.186 --> 04:26.417
- I'm Frasier Crane.
- Samantha Pierce. Sam.

04:26.732 --> 04:29.041
- Are you Dr Frasier Crane?
- Yes, I am.

04:29.318 --> 04:33.027
I thought your voice sounded familiar.
For a while, I thought you were

04:33.363 --> 04:36.480
the "white zone is for loading
and unloading only" guy.

04:36.783 --> 04:38.933
I get that a lot.

04:39.202 --> 04:42.638
Sam, may I thank you
by taking you to dinner tonight?

04:42.956 --> 04:46.744
That's very sweet of you, but I was
just trying to be a good Samaritan.

04:48.170 --> 04:50.968
- Thanks anyway.
- No, thank you.

04:51.256 --> 04:53.167
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

04:53.425 --> 04:55.541
- Oh, Sam?
- OK. I'd love to go to dinner.

04:56.887 --> 04:59.765
- That's wonderful.
- See? Persistence pays off.

05:00.057 --> 05:02.890
I was going to ask you
to get my parking validated.

05:03.185 --> 05:05.494
But this works out very well, too.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:17.491 --> 05:20.722
- What are you doing?
- Just watching football with you.

05:22.663 --> 05:24.654
- What's the score?
- 27-20.

05:24.915 --> 05:26.507
Great.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.662
- Want to know who's winning?
- Not particularly, no.

05:29.961 --> 05:32.873
Someone has a special evening planned.

05:33.173 --> 05:36.927
What tipped you off?
My incredible self-confident air?

05:37.260 --> 05:41.219
No, your silver collar pin. You
only wear it when you've got a hot date.

05:41.556 --> 05:45.390
Good work getting all the tarnish off.
It shined up quite nicely.

05:46.770 --> 05:49.489
- Evening, Dr Crane.
- Hello, Daphne. Dad, Frasier.

05:49.773 --> 05:51.809
- You ready to go?
- Give me a minute.

05:52.067 --> 05:55.184
Niles, I can't make it
to the boat show with you and Dad.

05:55.487 --> 06:00.925
- It'll just be the two of you.
- Too bad. Well, maybe some other time.

06:01.326 --> 06:03.965
Goodness. It is a clear night.

06:05.372 --> 06:07.363
It's been rather windy lately.

06:07.624 --> 06:11.299
- Look at those stars. Is that Orion?
- Yes, I believe it is.

06:11.628 --> 06:14.222
What are you doing?
We have a mutual support pact.

06:14.506 --> 06:17.339
When there's a Dad event,
we're there for each other.

06:17.634 --> 06:19.943
I have a date
with a spectacular woman.

06:20.220 --> 06:24.179
So what? I gave up <i>Traviata</i> tickets
to support you at a tractor pull.

06:25.475 --> 06:29.024
I thought we could stop
at that medieval restaurant for dinner.

06:29.354 --> 06:31.345
Sounds great, Dad.

06:33.483 --> 06:37.522
Daphne, would you like to use
my ticket for the boat show tonight?

06:37.863 --> 06:39.421
That would be nice.

06:40.449 --> 06:42.440
Very crafty.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.230
Who's the lucky lady?

06:45.495 --> 06:48.692
Her name is Samantha Pierce.
We just met yesterday.

06:48.999 --> 06:51.832
She recognised me from my radio show.

06:52.127 --> 06:54.561
In fact, when I asked her out,

06:55.797 --> 06:57.947
I sensed a shyness
which made me wonder

06:58.216 --> 07:00.491
if she was intimidated by my fame.

07:00.761 --> 07:02.752
Did you say Samantha Pierce?

07:03.013 --> 07:05.288
- Short blonde hair, blue eyes?
- Right.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.707
She's on <i>Larry King.</i>

07:08.435 --> 07:12.030
<i>We're here with noted attorney
Samantha Pierce.</i>

07:12.356 --> 07:17.146
<i>Currently she's trying a case in Seattle
defending "The Butcher Knife Killer".</i>

07:17.527 --> 07:20.246
<i>Sam, do you think
being in the public eye,</i>

07:20.530 --> 07:23.283
<i>dating some of the world's
most famous men,</i>

07:23.575 --> 07:25.645
<i>affects the way jurors perceive you?</i>

07:25.911 --> 07:29.540
<i>That's not really fair, Larry.
I don't date public figures.</i>

07:29.873 --> 07:33.786
<i>What about the much-publicised
relationship with Kevin Costner?</i>

07:34.127 --> 07:35.879
<i>Just a rumour.</i>

07:36.129 --> 07:38.359
- <i>George Stephanopoulos?</i>
- <i>A rumour, too.</i>

07:38.632 --> 07:42.591
- <i>Brad Pitt is another rumour?</i>
- <i>Yeah, but I started that one.</i>

07:45.764 --> 07:48.961
I can certainly see
how she'd be intimidated by your fame.

07:55.774 --> 07:59.210
I thought her name sounded familiar.
I must have read it.

07:59.528 --> 08:03.043
Congratulations.
You're playing in the big leagues now.

08:03.865 --> 08:07.335
Kevin Costner, Stephanopoulos,

08:07.661 --> 08:08.650
you...

08:10.038 --> 08:12.916
Don't let him shake your confidence.
You'll be fine.

08:13.208 --> 08:17.486
Maybe she's had her fill of attractive
men and is ready for a change.

08:20.048 --> 08:24.838
Aren't I lucky? Normally a troll like me
has to trick a woman to get a date.

08:25.220 --> 08:31.056
I once dated a man who had gone out with
several of the top British actresses

08:31.476 --> 08:34.195
but got sick of their vanity
and insecurity.

08:34.479 --> 08:36.708
See, it does happen.

08:36.982 --> 08:41.100
After he got through slumming, he dumped
me and went back to actresses.

08:41.445 --> 08:44.437
He did get me a signed
picture of Helena Bonham Carter.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.015
She's riding a pony.

08:53.999 --> 08:57.958
Teddy Kennedy, Henry Kissinger and
the Dalai Lama are on this plane...

08:58.295 --> 09:03.085
- I think I've heard this joke.
- No, this really happened to me.

09:04.217 --> 09:07.971
Well, don't I feel silly.

09:08.305 --> 09:10.978
Never mind,
it's not a very good story anyway.

09:13.060 --> 09:16.814
- How's your appetiser?
- It's delicious.

09:20.275 --> 09:22.914
- Your salad?
- It's very good.

09:23.195 --> 09:25.834
Actually, I haven't even tried it yet.

09:28.533 --> 09:30.524
I was right.

09:34.247 --> 09:37.557
I hope this doesn't offend you,
but I've had a stressful day,

09:37.876 --> 09:40.549
and I don't have the energy
to make small talk.

09:40.837 --> 09:44.466
Plus, I'm not very hungry.
Would you mind terribly if we just...?

09:44.800 --> 09:47.712
I know where this is headed.
You don't have to say it.

09:48.011 --> 09:51.970
Frasier, could we just go someplace
and have sex?

09:54.351 --> 09:56.342
Well, that you did have to say.

09:57.938 --> 10:00.168
I'm sorry. That sounded forward.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.954
But it's the only thing
I want to do right now.

10:04.820 --> 10:09.291
I'm flattered
and the thought is very tempting,

10:10.242 --> 10:12.437
but on my show I'm constantly preaching

10:12.703 --> 10:15.376
that people
should get to know one another,

10:15.664 --> 10:18.497
have things in common
before taking that kind of step.

10:20.919 --> 10:22.796
- What's your favourite colour?
- Blue.

10:23.046 --> 10:25.037
Mine, too. Check, please.

10:30.971 --> 10:34.008
- How was the boat show?
- It was wonderful.

10:34.308 --> 10:37.539
They had this great exhibit
where you climb into this boat,

10:37.853 --> 10:40.970
put on a life jacket
and they simulate what it's like

10:41.273 --> 10:43.503
to be caught out at sea in a hurricane.

10:49.948 --> 10:53.577
Niles, why did you ever agree
to go on a ride like that?

10:53.910 --> 10:57.186
I didn't. I dined at the snack bar.

11:00.167 --> 11:04.160
I guess this wasn't a very hot night
for you, huh? Home by 10.30?

11:04.504 --> 11:06.495
Found my bra.

11:10.510 --> 11:12.501
This is embarrassing.

11:12.763 --> 11:15.755
Not at all. No, Sam,
this is my brother, Dr Niles Crane,

11:16.058 --> 11:19.892
and my father, Martin Crane, and
his healthcare worker, Daphne Moon.

11:20.228 --> 11:23.459
I've been watching the trial
on TV. It's fascinating.

11:23.774 --> 11:25.492
For us, too.

11:26.985 --> 11:30.978
I'd better get going. I have an early
morning. Lovely meeting all of you.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.299
- I had a wonderful evening.
- So did I.

11:39.206 --> 11:40.195
Good night.

11:48.048 --> 11:52.678
- I'm off to bed.
- Not so fast, mister.

11:53.053 --> 11:56.568
I can tell by that goofy smile of yours
that you're smitten.

11:56.890 --> 12:00.963
Thank you, Niles,
but I am not some dewy-eyed teenager.

12:02.145 --> 12:05.660
She did say the cutest things.

12:05.983 --> 12:09.612
She said murderers often show
no remorse for their actions

12:09.945 --> 12:12.334
because they have no moral centre.

12:15.659 --> 12:17.775
It was cute the way she said it.

12:22.416 --> 12:26.967
I want you to taste this
and tell me what you think.

12:28.213 --> 12:31.285
That is spectacular.
Where did you learn how to do that?

12:31.591 --> 12:35.140
Just a little something I picked up
as a child at sauce camp.

12:41.059 --> 12:43.175
Hello. What?

12:43.437 --> 12:47.510
When did this happen? Because we're
expected to give full disclosure.

12:47.858 --> 12:49.849
Can't Brendan handle it?

12:50.110 --> 12:51.099
All right.

12:52.821 --> 12:55.130
I suppose you know
what I'm about to say.

12:55.407 --> 12:58.638
You want to skip dinner again
and go straight to sex?

13:00.746 --> 13:04.864
I'm sorry, Frasier. I really am.
You went to all this trouble.

13:05.542 --> 13:10.741
Fine French cooking is always better
after a night in the fridge.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.745
We just came back to get our umbrellas.

13:16.011 --> 13:19.845
- No, stay.
- I've been called back to work.

13:20.182 --> 13:24.858
- Don't let a good meal go to waste.
- Morel mushroom and tarragon sauce.

13:25.228 --> 13:26.661
How did you know?

13:26.897 --> 13:30.367
Niles can identify a sauce
from a great distance.

13:30.692 --> 13:32.762
His mother and I were so proud.

13:36.657 --> 13:40.809
If it's not too late, maybe I'll be able
to come back over after.

13:41.161 --> 13:44.631
- Either way I'll call you.
- That's what you said yesterday.

13:44.956 --> 13:49.074
I told you I was sorry about that.
I promise I'll call.

13:55.342 --> 13:57.936
Shame.
And after you cooked that lovely meal.

13:58.220 --> 14:01.735
Let me tell you something,
crown roast does not prepare itself.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.752
It's funny.
As much as I care for this woman,

14:08.897 --> 14:12.970
there's something about this
relationship that leaves me unsettled.

14:14.194 --> 14:17.106
I might venture a theory
at which you're sure to hoot.

14:19.950 --> 14:22.748
What may be making you uncomfortable
is that

14:23.036 --> 14:26.631
you find yourself
in the more submissive role.

14:26.957 --> 14:29.517
What are you talking about?

14:29.793 --> 14:32.182
I think what he means is
you're the girl.

14:36.383 --> 14:38.943
Think about it.
How did you two first meet?

14:39.219 --> 14:43.212
She came to your rescue. Who initiated
the first sexual encounter? She did.

14:43.557 --> 14:47.311
She did? Who's wearing
the pants in this relationship?

14:47.644 --> 14:51.080
As much fun as it must be for you
to spin out this little theory,

14:51.398 --> 14:53.389
it's without foundation.

14:53.650 --> 14:55.641
There's my rosemary bread.

14:59.990 --> 15:03.505
If it's any consolation,
I know what you're going through.

15:03.827 --> 15:06.500
Women have put up with it
for generations.

15:06.788 --> 15:08.779
Men say they'll call, and they don't.

15:09.041 --> 15:12.716
Or you get a few nice dinners
and then the eventual booty call.

15:13.962 --> 15:15.953
I did not get a booty call.

15:17.799 --> 15:19.790
What's a booty call?

15:20.052 --> 15:24.443
A late-night call inviting you to meet,
but with the goal of just having sex.

15:24.806 --> 15:27.081
I did get a booty call.

15:27.809 --> 15:31.722
Frasier, you should nip this thing
in the bud before it gets out of hand.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.500
We don't have to look beyond
our own family to find an example

15:35.817 --> 15:38.650
of someone who let a woman
run the show from the start

15:38.945 --> 15:41.095
and has been paying for it ever since.

15:41.365 --> 15:43.356
Poor Uncle Frank.

15:46.536 --> 15:48.527
I'm wasting my time fighting you.

15:48.789 --> 15:51.383
You can take any detail
from this relationship

15:51.667 --> 15:54.465
and twist it
to support your ridiculous theory.

15:54.753 --> 15:57.870
I saw a guy selling these.
I thought they'd cheer you up.

15:58.173 --> 16:00.129
They're beautiful.

16:01.426 --> 16:03.576
- You are so...
- Really got to run.

16:08.558 --> 16:11.675
I suppose now you're going
to read something into this.

16:18.151 --> 16:22.064
- I really love that tie.
- You should. You sent it to me.

16:22.406 --> 16:23.805
Oh, yeah, right.

16:25.325 --> 16:29.955
- Your secretary picked it out.
- He has better taste than I do.

16:31.415 --> 16:34.930
Don't worry about tonight.
I know how boring these parties are

16:35.252 --> 16:37.402
and I promise we won't stay long.

16:37.671 --> 16:38.990
Sam.

16:39.214 --> 16:41.728
Meet our senior partner, Daniel Gill.

16:42.009 --> 16:45.968
How are you? Sam, they're ready
for us on that conference call.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.296
It'll just take a minute.

16:54.271 --> 16:55.545
You're new.

16:55.772 --> 16:57.364
I'm Frasier.

16:57.607 --> 17:01.043
I'm Jennifer, Stewart's wife.
This is Cindy Dolce.

17:01.361 --> 17:04.558
She's married to Bob.
Terri Bailey. She's living with Ed.

17:04.865 --> 17:09.336
And Vanessa Saint-Claire,
soon to be Mrs Irving Lumpowsky.

17:09.703 --> 17:11.772
Good heavens.

17:12.039 --> 17:14.348
How long have you and Sam
been seeing each other?

17:14.624 --> 17:18.299
About three weeks. We haven't
been able to get much time together

17:18.628 --> 17:22.588
but she assures me that'll all change
as soon as the trial's over.

17:26.386 --> 17:29.935
There's always another trial.
But you'll get used to the life.

17:30.265 --> 17:33.098
Dates getting cancelled,
dinners left uneaten.

17:33.393 --> 17:36.226
But at least
you'll get sent plenty of flowers.

17:36.730 --> 17:40.040
Jennifer, he's a man.
He won't get flowers.

17:42.861 --> 17:46.376
Sam, could I have a word with you
in private, please?

17:49.618 --> 17:51.609
Is there something wrong?

17:51.870 --> 17:53.986
It's not the best time
to bring this up,

17:54.247 --> 17:57.205
but I feel
an uneasiness about this relationship.

17:57.501 --> 17:59.014
What do you mean?

17:59.252 --> 18:03.086
I'm not one to get bogged down
in male-female role playing.

18:03.423 --> 18:05.539
It's just that lately...

18:07.678 --> 18:11.193
Take our first date. We'd barely
begun dinner when you suggested

18:11.515 --> 18:13.551
we go to bed together.

18:13.809 --> 18:16.004
Traditionally, that is...

18:18.480 --> 18:20.948
every man's dream. OK, bad example.

18:23.610 --> 18:28.638
But then you cancel dates all the time
and you say you'll call and you don't.

18:29.032 --> 18:32.911
And you have your secretary send me
a gift and when I get upset about it,

18:33.245 --> 18:35.918
you think
you can buy me off with flowers.

18:36.206 --> 18:39.596
Is that it? That's what
you dragged me out here for?

18:39.918 --> 18:42.955
I'm in the middle of the most intense
case of my career.

18:43.255 --> 18:46.930
A man's life hangs in the balance
and you're whining about flowers?

18:47.259 --> 18:51.696
- Whining's a little strong.
- Well, tell me what you mean, Frasier.

18:52.055 --> 18:56.810
If you were the one working late hours,
breaking dates and sending gifts,

18:57.185 --> 18:59.904
- would that be OK?
- No, that's not it.

19:00.188 --> 19:03.419
You're a psychiatrist.
Shouldn't you be above all of this?

19:03.734 --> 19:06.373
I'm just telling you how I feel.

19:06.653 --> 19:09.565
Do you want to be the traditional man

19:09.865 --> 19:13.175
- and I'll be the put-upon woman?
- No, that's not what I want.

19:16.621 --> 19:21.775
I just wish we could have a relationship
where neither one of us is the man.

19:22.169 --> 19:25.081
So that would make us what?

19:25.380 --> 19:27.371
A lesbian couple?

19:28.759 --> 19:30.750
They're very in now.

19:32.929 --> 19:36.558
Frasier, I know
no one likes being stood up.

19:36.892 --> 19:39.770
I'll try to be more understanding.

19:40.062 --> 19:43.850
And I'll try
to stop being so damn emotional.

19:46.526 --> 19:50.519
I'm glad we had this talk because
I was about to make a big mistake.

19:50.864 --> 19:51.853
What?

19:52.074 --> 19:56.431
The other day when we were in the store
you mentioned you liked something,

19:56.787 --> 19:59.824
and, typical me,
I just ran right out and bought it.

20:00.123 --> 20:03.001
Sort of dodged a bullet there,
didn't we?

20:04.169 --> 20:06.160
So what was it?

20:07.714 --> 20:08.703
This.

20:12.302 --> 20:14.372
And you bought this for me?

20:15.764 --> 20:20.121
I'm really rather embarrassed, Frasier.
You were right.

20:21.687 --> 20:25.680
I take relationships for granted,
and then I just run off to Cartier

20:26.024 --> 20:28.857
- and buy a gift to make up for it.
- Cartier?

20:29.987 --> 20:34.105
No, I'll return it, I promise.
I know how strongly you feel.

20:34.449 --> 20:37.600
Maybe I've been
a bit self-absorbed lately.

20:38.161 --> 20:41.597
You're a person
who likes to express their affection

20:41.915 --> 20:45.305
by buying gifts.
Who am I to stand in your way?

20:51.383 --> 20:53.180
It's lovely.

20:54.428 --> 20:56.658
Frasier, it isn't about the gifts.

20:56.930 --> 21:00.047
I give gifts because
I can never think of the right words.

21:00.350 --> 21:02.659
Is this what you're trying to say?

21:09.985 --> 21:11.976
Very well put.

21:13.488 --> 21:15.843
Let's get out of here.
I'll get our coats.

21:16.116 --> 21:18.949
No, I will get our coats.

21:19.244 --> 21:22.759
- You don't know where they are.
- All right. You get them.

21:25.834 --> 21:27.825
I'm so bored. What time is it?

21:28.086 --> 21:30.554
Time? Let's just have a look.

21:32.841 --> 21:36.197
Isn't that fabulous? It's Cartier.
Sam gave it to me.
