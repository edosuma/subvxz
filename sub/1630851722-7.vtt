PHIL KEOGHAN:
Previously onTough As Nails...

00:03.343 --> 00:04.689
Dirty Hands dug deep

00:04.724 --> 00:07.862
and brought the team score
to 4-2.

00:07.895 --> 00:09.654
Dirty Hands with the win!

00:09.689 --> 00:11.619
-Yeah!
-Leaving Savage Crew

00:11.654 --> 00:13.551
knee-deep in mud and mayhem.

00:13.586 --> 00:15.205
-[laughter]
-SARAH: I don't know

00:15.240 --> 00:16.896
why we're celebrating the loss.

00:16.931 --> 00:18.724
I, really--
I'm speechless on that.

00:18.757 --> 00:21.033
KEOGHAN:
And in the individual
competition...

00:21.068 --> 00:22.240
HANGER:
Go, go, go, go.

00:22.274 --> 00:24.792
KEOGHAN:
Speed and efficiency,
key factors to this job.

00:24.827 --> 00:26.448
-ELIZABETH: My hip is out.
-KEOGHAN: Elizabeth's down.

00:26.481 --> 00:28.379
KELSY:
Everybody, give it your all.

00:28.413 --> 00:30.379
KEOGHAN:
...Lia picked her way
to victory.

00:30.413 --> 00:33.103
KEOGHAN:
And Lia gets the win!

00:33.137 --> 00:35.310
While two of her
Dirty Hands teammates

00:35.344 --> 00:38.792
had to battle it out
in a harrowing overtime.

00:38.826 --> 00:40.723
This is gonna be close.

00:40.758 --> 00:43.344
Christine fell behind
and punched out.

00:45.033 --> 00:49.481
Tonight, with Dirty Hands
just one win away from being

00:49.517 --> 00:53.481
overall team champions,
it's do or die for Savage Crew.

00:53.517 --> 00:55.067
Both teams are neck and neck.

00:55.103 --> 00:57.240
-SARAH: Eight is not there.
-That's not right!

00:57.274 --> 00:59.033
KEOGHAN:
In the individual competition...

00:59.067 --> 01:02.274
Each of you is going to set up
a DJ station.

01:02.310 --> 01:03.517
...it's a mash-up,

01:03.551 --> 01:05.793
as the remaining seven
are left spinning.

01:05.826 --> 01:08.793
You do not want to get cut
from the individual competition.

01:08.826 --> 01:11.757
Who can turn in a win
and avoid punching out?

01:11.793 --> 01:13.034
No.

01:13.067 --> 01:15.724
This is Tough As Nails.

01:15.757 --> 01:17.343
♪

01:42.793 --> 01:44.103
♪

01:56.171 --> 01:58.206

LIA:
All right, guys,
this is the day.

02:05.067 --> 02:08.550
One more win.
We need one more win.

02:08.586 --> 02:11.343
Today is the day where we
give it absolutely everything.

02:11.378 --> 02:12.516
JEROME:
Everything.

02:12.550 --> 02:14.481
Dirty Hands is up 4-2.

02:14.516 --> 02:17.137
We need to win
one more challenge

02:17.171 --> 02:19.758
to win that $60,000
cash bonus prize.

02:19.793 --> 02:21.896
We're absolutely determined

02:21.931 --> 02:23.965
to get that fifth
Badge of Honor.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.103
We're just going in
guns blazing,

02:26.137 --> 02:27.688
all of our heart,
all of our soul.

02:27.723 --> 02:29.343
QUINCEY:
It's a big deal for me.
Y'all heard the story

02:29.378 --> 02:31.723
about my high school career
and all,

02:31.758 --> 02:34.586
and how I wasn't able
to help my team advance.

02:34.620 --> 02:37.378
And, you know, I-I get--
I get another shot.

02:37.413 --> 02:38.378
-Mm.
-You know what I mean? So...

02:38.413 --> 02:40.103
We're Quincey's football team.

02:40.137 --> 02:41.965
This is where I'll get
my redemption, right here today.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.723
-Yeah.
-KALIMBA: I-I'm a fullback.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.688
What are you, Jerome?
A quarterback?

02:45.723 --> 02:46.688
Water boy.

02:46.723 --> 02:48.448
-Water boy?
-[laughter]

02:50.067 --> 02:51.378
It's game time, baby.

02:51.413 --> 02:52.516
KELSY:
It's four to two,

02:52.550 --> 02:54.310
and it's all or none right now.

02:54.343 --> 02:57.586
ELIZABETH:
Yeah, because I think
what caused the issue

02:57.620 --> 03:00.550
last challenge,
we got really spread out.

03:00.586 --> 03:01.861
HANGER:
You're right, our strength

03:01.895 --> 03:04.378
is our sticking together as one.

03:04.413 --> 03:05.481
Absolutely.

03:05.516 --> 03:07.895
Savage Crew will
come together today.

03:07.931 --> 03:08.931
We have to.

03:08.965 --> 03:11.137
I think my team has
their heads in the game

03:11.171 --> 03:12.310
coming into this challenge

03:12.343 --> 03:14.378
because our backs
are against the wall.

03:14.413 --> 03:16.688
We need to win the next
three team competitions.

03:16.723 --> 03:18.861
So we're coming out fighting.

03:18.896 --> 03:20.275
Let's make today happen.

03:25.481 --> 03:27.378
-Good morning, Phil!
-KEOGHAN: Good morning.

03:27.413 --> 03:30.758
If you look up ahead,
you will see the Wiltern.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.033
-LIA: Wow.
-MIKE: Oh, man.

03:32.067 --> 03:33.620
KELSY:
Holy cow.

03:33.655 --> 03:35.793
KEOGHAN:
Built back in 1931,

03:35.826 --> 03:37.343
-beautiful art deco building.
-TAK: Wow.

03:37.378 --> 03:38.861
KELSY:
That's Hollywood.

03:38.896 --> 03:41.550
Holy cow, look at these doors.

03:41.586 --> 03:43.033
KEOGHAN:
Have a look at this.

03:43.067 --> 03:45.240
KELSY:
Wow, look at that ceiling.

03:45.275 --> 03:46.586
ALFIE:
Yeah, this is nuts, man.

03:46.620 --> 03:49.378
JEROME: Whoa, this architecture
is crazy, bro.

03:51.033 --> 03:52.171
-Check that out.
-Whoa.

03:52.206 --> 03:53.413
CONTESTANTS:
Wow.

03:53.448 --> 03:55.930
KEOGHAN:
Think of any major performer

03:55.965 --> 03:57.793
in the last 90 years,

03:57.826 --> 04:00.826
and chances are
they've performed on this stage.

04:00.861 --> 04:03.895
Before any performer
can get up on that stage,

04:03.931 --> 04:06.310
there's a lot of hard work
that has to take place.

04:06.343 --> 04:10.448
The people that do that work are
commonly referred to as roadies.

04:11.688 --> 04:14.103
Let's raise that fire curtain.

04:14.137 --> 04:16.379
And guess who's waiting for you.

04:16.413 --> 04:19.793
Tim and Oz,
both production riggers.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.274
They are the ones
that do all the hard work

04:21.310 --> 04:22.550
setting up the shows,

04:22.586 --> 04:24.862
and they're gonna be
watching your work.

04:24.896 --> 04:26.723
Did you ever think you'd be
performing at the Wiltern?

04:26.757 --> 04:27.930
-No.
-[laughter]

04:27.964 --> 04:29.103
KEOGHAN:
Your job today

04:29.137 --> 04:33.723
is you are going
to set up a lighting grid.

04:33.757 --> 04:35.586
Just like you would see
at a rock concert.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.240
KALIMBA:
I have some experience
working this field.

04:38.274 --> 04:39.620
My dad's a reggae musician.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.930
I have helped doing

04:40.965 --> 04:42.586
the miking for the sound,

04:42.620 --> 04:44.206
and mainly, picking up at the
end of the night

04:44.240 --> 04:45.862
while they all sat at the bar.

04:45.896 --> 04:48.033
KEOGHAN:
There are two trucks out back

04:48.067 --> 04:50.206
filled with steel truss, tools

04:50.240 --> 04:53.274
and all the lights
and cables you need.

04:53.310 --> 04:55.896
Step one is to build
a structure using trusses,

04:55.930 --> 04:59.137
like the ones that you see
out on the stage there.

04:59.172 --> 05:02.137
Step two, you will then
have to put the lights

05:02.172 --> 05:04.689
in the correct positions
according to this plan.

05:04.723 --> 05:06.654
-We got this.
-And the man

05:06.689 --> 05:08.550
who will be making sure
your lights

05:08.586 --> 05:10.103
are correctly placed
on the truss,

05:10.137 --> 05:11.826
our lighting director Sean.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.516
SEAN:
My role is to confirm

05:13.550 --> 05:16.586
that you have hung the lights
in the right spot

05:16.620 --> 05:19.310
and that they come on
in the right sequence.

05:19.343 --> 05:21.516
And that's how
the challenge ends today.

05:21.550 --> 05:23.413
Remember, you win
today's challenge,

05:23.447 --> 05:26.964
-you get $12,000...
-[applause]

05:27.000 --> 05:29.930
...and today's Badge of Honor.

05:29.964 --> 05:31.964
This might be the most
valuable Badge of Honor

05:32.000 --> 05:34.172
that you have had
to compete for so far

05:34.206 --> 05:35.689
on Tough As Nails.

05:35.723 --> 05:37.103
Dirty Hands have four of them.

05:37.137 --> 05:39.896
If they get this one today,
that'll be five wins,

05:39.930 --> 05:42.413
making them
the overall team champions.

05:42.447 --> 05:46.379
They will be winning a cash
bonus prize of $60,000.

05:46.413 --> 05:49.240
They will win
the team competition.

05:49.274 --> 05:52.413
We're gonna go in this hard
because we want that $60,000.

05:52.447 --> 05:54.481
We're all hungry for it.

05:54.516 --> 05:55.930
We don't want to let
our foot off the gas,

05:55.965 --> 05:58.447
and we're gonna try
and take it today.

05:58.481 --> 06:00.586
Savage Crew, it's not too late,

06:00.620 --> 06:02.033
but you need to win today
if you want

06:02.067 --> 06:03.757
to keep your chances alive.

06:03.793 --> 06:05.379
MIKE:
I've been feeling like

06:05.413 --> 06:06.862
I got a lot of weight
on my shoulders.

06:06.896 --> 06:09.033
I really haven't slept much.

06:09.067 --> 06:10.586
You know,
'cause I picked the people

06:10.620 --> 06:12.586
to be on Savage Crew, and I feel

06:12.620 --> 06:14.654
like I'm responsible.

06:14.689 --> 06:16.723
And then,
hearing everybody's story,

06:16.757 --> 06:17.826
and especially Sarah, you know?

06:17.862 --> 06:19.274
Hearing the story about
her grandfather

06:19.310 --> 06:22.586
and what she wants to do
for her nieces and nephews.

06:22.620 --> 06:24.137
She gives me that drive, too.

06:24.172 --> 06:25.723
KEOGHAN:
Take a moment to figure out

06:25.757 --> 06:27.274
who's gonna be the crew boss.

06:27.310 --> 06:30.689
Sarah's good with everything
that we need to keep organized.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.206
KELSY:
We have so much trust in Sarah.

06:32.240 --> 06:34.586
She has great skills
at planning.

06:34.620 --> 06:37.447
You guys can do the wiring
because y'all are both

06:37.481 --> 06:39.000
familiar with circuits.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.757
Telling people
where they should go

06:40.793 --> 06:42.965
and how to be as productive
as possible.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.137
-It's all or none, right here.
-MIKE: Mm-hmm.

06:45.172 --> 06:46.826
So I think Christine should
be the crew boss.

06:46.862 --> 06:48.586
-We fall in place when
you're crew boss.
-KALIMBA: Yeah, yeah,

06:48.620 --> 06:49.862
-let's just do that.
-Okay, that's fine.
-LIA: We do.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.793
JEROME:
We're all, like, super excited,

06:51.826 --> 06:53.447
like, we're like,
"Finish this already."

06:53.481 --> 06:55.000
We get that 60 grand,

06:55.033 --> 06:58.000
we could make $72,000 today.

06:58.033 --> 07:00.240
Let's get this for our families.

07:00.274 --> 07:02.550
On the work whistle.

07:02.586 --> 07:05.930
ALFIE:
Communication,
communication, communication

07:05.964 --> 07:07.826
makes the team work,

07:07.862 --> 07:09.930
and we don't have a choice
but to win today.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.586
[work whistle blows]

07:13.620 --> 07:14.793
Go, go, go.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.033
LIA:
Go, Tak, go.

07:16.067 --> 07:18.481
Go, go, go, go, go!

07:18.516 --> 07:20.620
LIA:
Our game plan is to get
out to the truck

07:20.654 --> 07:22.000
as fast as we can.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.481
There's a tool bag,

07:23.516 --> 07:25.447
-the truss...
-KALIMBA: Put it on top.
-Oh, yeah.

07:25.481 --> 07:28.172
...and a cart
full of cables that we need

07:28.206 --> 07:29.757
for the power to the lights.

07:29.793 --> 07:30.757
JEROME:
Go, go, go.

07:32.447 --> 07:35.481
KEOGHAN:
Everybody,
double-check your plans.

07:35.516 --> 07:37.172
We need the ten-foot over there.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.413
LIA:
Make sure they're turned right.
These are not right.

07:38.447 --> 07:39.862
JEROME: They're wrong now,
this is wrong.

07:39.896 --> 07:41.379
-This is wrong.
-This is wrong.

07:41.413 --> 07:43.137
-SARAH: Remember, washer,
one on each side.
-HANGER: Yes.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.274
-Yes.
-Washer, one on each side.

07:45.310 --> 07:47.930
KEOGHAN:
Kelsy already starting to bolt
the truss together.

07:47.965 --> 07:49.172
Attention to detail is crucial.

07:49.206 --> 07:50.930
-JEROME: Good job. You got it?
-TAK: Yeah.

07:50.965 --> 07:53.000
KEOGHAN:
You have four different
lengths of trusses to assemble:

07:53.033 --> 07:56.033
four, six, eight
and ten-feet sections.

07:56.067 --> 07:57.550
You connect any of them
in the wrong place,

07:57.586 --> 07:59.103
you're gonna have
to go back and fix it.

07:59.137 --> 08:01.482
If ever there was a day
to get it right, it's today.

08:01.516 --> 08:04.000
CHRISTINE:
That does not look
like six feet. Double-check.

08:04.033 --> 08:06.826
I do have some experience
with trusses.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.033
You know, in ironwork,

08:08.067 --> 08:09.723
we use those between floors
of a building...

08:09.757 --> 08:11.206
-Eight-foot...
-Eight-foot here.

08:11.240 --> 08:13.413
...to link the exterior
iron together.

08:14.654 --> 08:16.033
Kelsy, that's not right.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.310
KELSY:
What do you mean?
It's a triangle.

08:17.343 --> 08:20.206
-This is not right.
-SARAH: Alfie!

08:20.240 --> 08:22.103
-Double-check prints.
-ALFIE: I got an eight

08:22.137 --> 08:24.862
and I got a six, perfect.

08:24.896 --> 08:26.481
SARAH:
We have Alfie,

08:26.516 --> 08:28.240
superintendent in his real life,

08:28.274 --> 08:30.793
who is really great with
paying attention to detail.

08:30.826 --> 08:32.688
So we're trusting him

08:32.724 --> 08:34.724
to place everything
correctly where it needs to go.

08:34.758 --> 08:36.724
I need three sixes
in the middle. I got them.

08:36.758 --> 08:38.688
KEOGHAN:
It's neck and neck,

08:38.724 --> 08:41.826
but have both teams got their
trusses together correctly?

08:41.861 --> 08:42.965
CHRISTINE:
This needs tightening.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.033
-This middle?
-Right there.

08:44.067 --> 08:45.206
SARAH:
Tighten, tighten, tighten.

08:45.240 --> 08:47.309
-KEOGHAN: They are flying
through this, Tim.
-Yeah.

08:47.344 --> 08:50.309
KEOGHAN:
Both teams with all 12 pieces
of truss in place.

08:50.344 --> 08:52.447
Now tightening all 68 bolts.

08:52.481 --> 08:54.067
-ALFIE: We're tight,
we're tight.
-SARAH: All right, let's go.

08:54.102 --> 08:55.274
-Socket, socket, socket.
-Jerome, Jerome.

08:55.309 --> 08:56.758
Here, here. Go, go, go.

08:56.793 --> 08:57.724
-That was it.
-Check! Check!

08:57.758 --> 08:58.724
Double-check, double-check.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.033
KEOGHAN:
Check.

09:00.067 --> 09:01.688
Savage Crew looking
for an inspection,

09:01.724 --> 09:05.033
so they can lift their truss
and start rigging their lights.

09:05.067 --> 09:06.551
Dirty Hands still trying
to finish up

09:06.586 --> 09:07.965
to get their check done.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.551
TIM:
No.

09:09.586 --> 09:11.309
KEOGHAN:
Check no good

09:11.344 --> 09:13.620
for Savage Crew,
they've got to fix it.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.481
SARAH:
It's so nerve-racking,
we need this win.

09:16.517 --> 09:18.344
I think all of us
kind of stopped breathing

09:18.379 --> 09:20.067
for a minute,
and we're just wondering

09:20.102 --> 09:22.895
if we're able to correct
that mistake quicker

09:22.931 --> 09:24.172
than Dirty Hands
gets the lead on us.

09:24.206 --> 09:26.033
-All the way, all the way.
-Okay, okay.

09:26.067 --> 09:27.413
-OZ: You guys ready?
-Yeah.

09:27.447 --> 09:29.724
KEOGHAN:
Now Dirty Hands looking
for a check.

09:29.758 --> 09:31.033
This is a crucial moment.

09:31.067 --> 09:32.067
JEROME:
Good?

09:32.102 --> 09:34.033
No.

09:34.067 --> 09:35.931
KEOGHAN:
Oz says it's not correct.

09:35.965 --> 09:37.654
-Check your plans.
-JEROME: Check-check
that middle.

09:37.688 --> 09:38.688
ELIZABETH:
We're a foot off.

09:38.724 --> 09:40.240
HANGER:
Go, go, go, go, go.

09:40.274 --> 09:41.826
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew have figured out

09:41.861 --> 09:43.551
that their center truss
is not square.

09:43.586 --> 09:44.826
ALFIE:
Right there.

09:44.861 --> 09:46.240
Elizabeth gets
the measuring tape,

09:46.274 --> 09:47.793
it's six,
this one's almost seven.

09:47.826 --> 09:49.344
She's like, "We got
to knock it back a foot."

09:49.379 --> 09:51.309
So push it back,
tighten it back up,

09:51.344 --> 09:53.965
so we can request
an inspection once again.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.861
-HANGER: You got to go this way.
There you go.
-QUINCEY: Look.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.931
-They're not in
the triangle form.
-TAK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.413
-That one, that one.
-KALIMBA: Undo it, undo it...

09:59.447 --> 10:01.620
TAK:
Come to find out
one was upside down.

10:01.654 --> 10:05.688
So we had to take that apart,
flip it right side up,

10:05.724 --> 10:07.724
and then reconnect it.

10:07.758 --> 10:09.413
CHRISTINE:
Make sure they're all
going the same way.

10:09.447 --> 10:11.206
-KALIMBA: It looks--
it's the right way.
-HANGER: Okay, good.

10:11.240 --> 10:12.654
-We're good. We're good on that.
-KELSY: We're good. Check.

10:12.688 --> 10:13.793
HANGER:
We're good, we're good,
we're good.

10:13.826 --> 10:14.965
Check.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.309
-JEROME: Go, go, go, go.
-OZ: You ready?

10:16.344 --> 10:17.481
-CHRISTINE: Yes.
-JEROME: Ready.

10:17.517 --> 10:19.309
KEOGHAN:
Both teams looking for a check

10:19.344 --> 10:21.172
at the same time.

10:21.206 --> 10:22.551
OZ:
Acceptable.

10:24.102 --> 10:25.965
I'm just checking
one more bolt, guys.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.413
-HANGER: Good?
-How we looking, Tim?

10:28.447 --> 10:31.309
-TIM: They're all good.
-The check is good
for Savage Crew.

10:31.344 --> 10:33.240
Dirty Hands' truss is good.

10:33.274 --> 10:34.965
KEOGHAN:
Closely followed by Dirty Hands,

10:35.000 --> 10:36.517
who complete their first step.

10:36.551 --> 10:38.654
Trusses going
to working height now

10:38.688 --> 10:40.172
so they can get their lights on.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.688
ALFIE:
Stay to your right,
stay to your right.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.033
HANGER:
Okay, okay.

10:43.067 --> 10:45.688
KEOGHAN:
24 lights need to go
on these trusses.

10:45.724 --> 10:47.793
Look where five is on there
and place it.

10:47.826 --> 10:49.688
Kelsy, myself and Hanger

10:49.724 --> 10:50.826
start setting up

10:50.861 --> 10:52.000
where the lights need to go

10:52.033 --> 10:54.206
while Elizabeth

10:54.240 --> 10:56.274
and Electro Man Mike
are going to be taking care

10:56.309 --> 10:58.654
of wiring the cables
and getting them set up.

10:58.688 --> 11:01.206
KEOGHAN:
There are three different types
of lights that need to go

11:01.240 --> 11:02.517
onto the truss.

11:02.551 --> 11:05.102
The exact positions
are on the lighting plot.

11:05.136 --> 11:08.240
14, 15, 16, 14, all this corner.

11:08.274 --> 11:10.517
I just start calling out
some numbers

11:10.551 --> 11:13.136
and a specific corner
just to get us started.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.102
-What else we looking for?
-CHRISTINE: Number 14.

11:15.136 --> 11:17.861
It's gonna be a longer light
like one of these.

11:17.895 --> 11:19.620
MIKE:
I work with wires.

11:19.654 --> 11:21.551
If anything's
in the wrong place,

11:21.586 --> 11:23.861
it's not gonna turn on, or it's
gonna blow up in your face.

11:23.895 --> 11:27.965
So I just take my time
and be precise

11:28.000 --> 11:29.724
with where these wires
need to go.

11:29.758 --> 11:32.931
SARAH:
Pay attention to where you're
placing it, guys. Pay attention.

11:32.965 --> 11:34.931
The front row all needs to flip.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.379
It's facing the wrong way.

11:36.413 --> 11:37.931
-Flip where?
-Number seven, number two

11:37.965 --> 11:39.895
and number one. Turn them.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.931
Dirty Hands realizing
that they've got

11:41.965 --> 11:43.758
lights that are facing
the wrong way.

11:43.793 --> 11:45.654
-ELIZABETH: I've already got it.
I've already got it.
-What's that one, Kelsy?

11:45.688 --> 11:47.586
I've already got it.
It's hooked up all the way.

11:47.620 --> 11:48.688
-Worry about a different one.
-SARAH: Kelsy, wrong number.

11:48.724 --> 11:49.688
-Eight.
-SARAH: Eight is wrong.

11:49.724 --> 11:51.172
-Eight is wrong.
-It's right here.

11:51.206 --> 11:53.136
-That's seven.
Where you're at is seven.
-It's not right!

11:53.172 --> 11:54.136
-This is not right.
-ELIZABETH: Just calm down.

11:54.172 --> 11:56.102
What number is yours?

11:56.136 --> 11:57.688
-ELIZABETH: It's eight.
Right here. I told you.
-ALFIE: It's already plugged in.

11:57.724 --> 11:59.206
-ELIZABETH:
I've got it right here.
-That's wrong!

11:59.240 --> 12:01.067
-Eight is not there. Elizabeth.
-That's not right!

12:01.102 --> 12:02.586
Look at the peg. It's not right.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.724
You just unplugged it.
I had it sitting here.

12:04.758 --> 12:07.344
-I just plugged it in. Look.
-This light is not
where it's supposed to be!

12:13.654 --> 12:15.481
-KELSY: This is not right!
-ELIZABETH: Just calm down.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.895
-I've got it right here.
-KELSY: That's wrong!

12:16.931 --> 12:18.344
This light is not
where it's supposed to be!

12:18.379 --> 12:19.895
Kelsy. Breathe.

12:19.931 --> 12:23.067
KELSY:
I was trying to address
to Elizabeth

12:23.102 --> 12:25.344
that the light
was not in the right area.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.758
-Is the light seven?
-KELSY: Okay? Yeah.

12:27.793 --> 12:29.758
-Cool. Is that one eight?
-KELSY: Yes, that's right.

12:29.793 --> 12:31.793
It was where it needed to be.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.274
That was my mistake.

12:33.309 --> 12:35.481
My emotions got the best of me,
and I got a little loud.

12:35.517 --> 12:37.965
Sarah,
I got number two right here.

12:38.000 --> 12:40.826
The beautiful thing about our
team is that we're all leaders,

12:40.861 --> 12:43.240
but you can only have
so many lions in one den

12:43.274 --> 12:45.724
before they start growling
and biting.

12:45.758 --> 12:48.688
-This is seven.
-ALFIE: It's about $60,000.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.793
[laughs]

12:49.826 --> 12:51.586
Check the cords.
Check the cords.

12:51.620 --> 12:53.240
This is wrong here.
Four and five.

12:53.274 --> 12:55.344
-¿Qué? Qué? ¿Qué?
Okay, get the five.
-We need

12:55.379 --> 12:57.654
an extension cord for five,
and it goes back there.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.654
The most difficult part
of this challenge

12:59.688 --> 13:01.517
is there's 24 different numbers,

13:01.551 --> 13:03.724
so you got
a lot of working parts.

13:03.758 --> 13:05.654
This is number four.
Thank God.

13:05.688 --> 13:07.447
-Good catch, Lia.
-Thank you.

13:07.481 --> 13:09.931
-What else?
-Let's get the banner.

13:09.965 --> 13:12.793
Hanger rolling over
like a stuntman.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.206
Ready for a lighting check.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.033
KEOGHAN:
Lighting director
is checking out the work

13:16.067 --> 13:17.758
-for Dirty Hands.
-SARAH: Check.

13:17.793 --> 13:19.067
-Check. Check.
-ALFIE: Check.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.654
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew have asked
for a check.

13:20.688 --> 13:22.172
They have to wait
until the lighting director's

13:22.206 --> 13:23.793
finished Dirty Hands' check.

13:23.826 --> 13:25.861
Not a good check on Dirty Hands.

13:25.895 --> 13:28.344
KEOGHAN:
Double-check your lighting plot.

13:28.379 --> 13:30.724
Now Savage Crew getting
their first lighting check.

13:30.758 --> 13:33.447
Not a good check on Savage Crew.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
Give us a hint.

13:36.033 --> 13:37.102
When they tell you, "Sorry,

13:37.136 --> 13:38.172
it's not right,"

13:38.206 --> 13:39.344
you have to start figuring out

13:39.379 --> 13:41.965
what's not right.
Tell us light. Tell us plug.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.413
KEOGHAN:
Check every light.

13:43.447 --> 13:44.965
CHRISTINE:
This one needs to move over.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.413
KEOGHAN:
Dirty Hands have found

13:46.447 --> 13:48.033
a mistake
and are looking to correct it.

13:48.067 --> 13:50.931
-Need a check.
-KALIMBA: Check.
-SARAH: What number is that?

13:50.965 --> 13:51.654
Nine.

13:51.688 --> 13:53.136
That one should be over there.

13:53.172 --> 13:54.551
KEOGHAN:
And now Savage Crew.

13:54.586 --> 13:56.517
They've found a mistake
they need to fix.

13:57.517 --> 13:59.620
Every second counts.

13:59.654 --> 14:01.895
-SARAH: Please, God.
-Check, check, check.

14:01.931 --> 14:03.172
KEOGHAN:
Check for Savage Crew.

14:03.206 --> 14:04.688
Dirty Hands is still wrong.

14:04.724 --> 14:06.654
CHRISTINE:
Move that over here.

14:06.688 --> 14:08.481
Move it over here.

14:08.517 --> 14:10.793
KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew
getting their second check.

14:13.136 --> 14:16.000
Savage Crew is good to fly.

14:16.033 --> 14:19.033
-Yeah!
-KEOGHAN:
Savage Crew good to fly.

14:20.206 --> 14:21.274
Tighten this.

14:23.309 --> 14:25.895
-[cheering]
-Yeah! Yeah!

14:25.931 --> 14:27.688
KEOGHAN:
And Savage Crew takes the win.

14:27.724 --> 14:29.033
SARAH:
Love y'all.

14:32.826 --> 14:36.481
MIKE:
Savage Crew really needed
to kick it up a notch,

14:36.517 --> 14:37.793
and all of us
stuck together today

14:37.826 --> 14:39.309
like we said we were gonna.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.344
We definitely need to win
two more challenges

14:41.379 --> 14:44.309
to get that 60,000
that we came here for.

14:44.344 --> 14:46.240
Sarah,
what does it mean to you today

14:46.274 --> 14:48.033
to be the crew boss
and to lead your team

14:48.067 --> 14:49.688
to a much-needed victory?

14:49.724 --> 14:50.931
SARAH:
From the minute I walked in, um,

14:50.965 --> 14:52.861
the first person
I thought of was my gramps.

14:52.895 --> 14:54.206
And, uh,

14:54.240 --> 14:58.033
he used to talk
about back in the day

14:58.067 --> 15:00.344
when he wasn't even allowed
in places like this.

15:00.379 --> 15:02.688
[sniffles]
So, for me to be

15:02.724 --> 15:04.274
the first in my family
to be in something,

15:04.309 --> 15:07.240
you know, so incredible,
I wanted it bad.

15:07.274 --> 15:08.517
To be here, to get this win.

15:08.551 --> 15:10.793
And I love my team for this.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.379
JEROME:
Yeah, Sarah!

15:14.379 --> 15:16.895
[chuckles softly]

15:16.931 --> 15:20.309
SARAH:
My gramps always wanted,
you know, greatness for me,

15:20.344 --> 15:22.654
and there were opportunities
that he wasn't afforded.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.895
Now that I have
those opportunities,

15:25.931 --> 15:27.724
I want to make the most
of all of them.

15:27.758 --> 15:30.895
We did it. We pulled one out.
All we got to do is two more.

15:30.931 --> 15:33.413
Sarah,
you made your grandfather proud.

15:33.447 --> 15:34.861
You made your team proud.

15:34.895 --> 15:36.931
$12,000

15:36.965 --> 15:39.793
and today's Badge of Honor.

15:39.826 --> 15:42.654
That goes to you.
Congratulations.

15:42.688 --> 15:46.309
Team score
is now 4-3 to Dirty Hands.

15:46.344 --> 15:48.172
We got a competition
on our hands now.

15:48.206 --> 15:50.586
I mean, they are not gonna just
hand that money over to you.

15:50.620 --> 15:53.172
-Yeah.
-JEROME: Nobody like losing.
Come on.

15:53.206 --> 15:54.758
But I got to shake this off.

15:54.793 --> 15:56.517
Imua.Move forward

15:56.551 --> 15:59.724
and-and-and go for the next one
'cause we still in the lead.

15:59.758 --> 16:01.551
And you know what happens next.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.240
We go back
to the individual competition.

16:04.274 --> 16:05.551
There's only seven of you left.

16:05.586 --> 16:06.965
In the end, there will be

16:07.000 --> 16:08.413
only one
Tough As Nailschampion.

16:08.447 --> 16:09.654
It's starting to heat up.

16:09.688 --> 16:12.102
All right, everybody.
Get some rest.

16:12.136 --> 16:13.895
See you back here tomorrow.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.274
Oz, Tim and Sean, thank you.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.517
Thank you, guys.

Thank you, guys.

16:26.931 --> 16:29.102
So, how did everybody sleep?

16:29.136 --> 16:30.447
Laying down.

16:30.481 --> 16:32.033
-HANGER: I slept... I slept...

-My back actually feels
really good today.
-Good.

16:34.172 --> 16:36.447
ELIZABETH:
Yeah, nobody's
really been injured. Like,

16:36.481 --> 16:37.793
everybody's still in the game,
you know?

16:37.826 --> 16:40.033
-Nothing
they can't recover from.
-HANGER: Exactly.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.172
Alfie, how many times
do you tell your guys,

16:42.206 --> 16:44.274
-"Safety, guys"?
-ALFIE: Oh, yeah.

16:44.309 --> 16:45.654
I'm gonna share with you
since you asked.

16:45.688 --> 16:48.654
I helped a buddy
start a landscaping company.

16:48.688 --> 16:51.724
So, these people wanted, like,
six to eight trees taken out.

16:51.758 --> 16:54.931
So I get my chain saw,
and I start nudging it.

16:54.965 --> 16:56.551
[imitates chain saw buzzing]

16:56.586 --> 16:59.620
That branch was
completely rotten on the inside,

16:59.654 --> 17:02.309
so it just collapsed.

17:02.344 --> 17:05.034
And, so, as soon as
that 1,500-pound branch

17:05.067 --> 17:08.309
hit the ladder,
it just catapulted me out.

17:08.344 --> 17:10.136
And that's all I remember.

17:10.172 --> 17:12.205
Next thing you know, I wake up

17:12.240 --> 17:14.378
four days later
in a hospital bed.

17:14.413 --> 17:16.517
I got tubes all in my arms.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.826
I got sensors
on my head and my chest.

17:19.862 --> 17:21.067
They said that my left leg

17:21.103 --> 17:23.240
was over my right shoulder
next to my ear.

17:23.275 --> 17:26.895
-ELIZABETH: Oh...
-KELSY: Mm.
-ALFIE: So, my spine shattered.

17:26.931 --> 17:29.034
So, it could have severed
your spinal cord

17:29.067 --> 17:30.344
-and you'd be paralyzed.
-Oh, yeah, well, that was...

17:30.378 --> 17:32.654
that was the biggest fear
that everybody had,

17:32.689 --> 17:35.481
that I was gonna be paralyzed
from the waist down.

17:35.517 --> 17:39.275

I'm here with you guys.

17:44.136 --> 17:45.517
in my life.

17:46.481 --> 17:48.481
I wasn't giving up.
I wasn't staying paralyzed.

That's-that's not my destiny.
That's not who I was.

17:51.792 --> 17:54.413
-That's crazy.
You are a miracle, then.

crowd-surfed before.

that DJ Gravity One is using.

is done,
you're gonna button it off

to take one extra trip

make it up on my install

24:43.448 --> 24:46.136
very intensely.
I'm puzzled right now.

24:46.172 --> 24:48.413
Everybody quietly working away.

24:48.448 --> 24:52.378
Tak has his lights up.
Speakers. Got his turntable.

24:52.413 --> 24:55.758
TAK:
I'm struggling really hard
with wiring connections.

24:55.792 --> 24:58.172
Getting frustrated.
But, you know,

24:58.205 --> 24:59.448
being a foreman at work,

24:59.481 --> 25:01.654
I've learned
that you cannot panic.

25:01.689 --> 25:02.792
I know how to stay calm

25:02.826 --> 25:04.067
and figure things out.

25:04.103 --> 25:05.689
This is connected.

25:05.723 --> 25:08.309
KEOGHAN:
Alfie also has
all his heavy equipment out.

25:08.344 --> 25:09.517
Lights are on.

25:09.550 --> 25:11.689
-Elizabeth's so calm.
-The top.

25:11.723 --> 25:13.034
Staying calm
is really important,

25:13.067 --> 25:15.931
because when I get frantic,
I make mistakes.

25:15.964 --> 25:18.172
And when you panic, you actually

25:18.205 --> 25:20.413
stop your brain
from functioning properly.

25:20.448 --> 25:23.378
HANGER:
Details. Details, guys. Details.

25:23.413 --> 25:26.826
KEOGHAN:
Jerome has now fixed his lights.
He has his two turntables up.

25:27.792 --> 25:31.000
And Jerome drops his mic
for a check.

25:36.172 --> 25:37.931
Uh...

25:37.964 --> 25:40.481
-And no.
-And the check is no good.

25:40.517 --> 25:41.931
JEROME:
I don't like to lose
in something

25:41.964 --> 25:44.034
where I know I can do better.

25:44.067 --> 25:46.344
Check everything, guys.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.550
-Alfie would like
a check, please.
-Yeah, Alfie!

25:51.586 --> 25:53.000
Yeah, Alfie!

25:53.034 --> 25:55.413
Has Alfie done it first time up?

25:55.448 --> 25:57.448
-Nope.
-And no good

25:57.481 --> 26:00.413
-for DJ Alfie-Beat.
-ALFIE: Now it's no longer

26:00.448 --> 26:01.586
a physical challenge.

26:01.619 --> 26:02.792
Wow.

26:02.826 --> 26:05.205
Now it's totally,
totally mental.

26:05.240 --> 26:07.136
What don't I see that he sees?

26:07.172 --> 26:09.826
So, "A" sub to computer.
"A" sub to computer.

26:09.862 --> 26:12.448
Everyone, focus on detail.

26:12.481 --> 26:14.654
Tak is looking for a check.

26:14.689 --> 26:17.275
This is DJ Tak's first check.

26:18.895 --> 26:21.136
-It is a no-go.
-KEOGHAN: Check is no good
for Tak.

26:21.172 --> 26:23.103
KALIMBA:
Look from top to bottom.

26:23.136 --> 26:26.000
Jerome coming back
for a second check.

26:26.034 --> 26:27.862
Has Jerome got it right?

26:28.792 --> 26:31.619
What does DJ Gravity One say?

26:31.654 --> 26:33.758
-No.
-He said no, that's not it.
-Focus!

26:33.792 --> 26:36.103
SARAH:
DJ Gravity's
not letting anything slide.

26:36.136 --> 26:37.619
He gives you that sign,
and you're like,

26:37.654 --> 26:39.034
-"Aw, man."
-No.

26:39.067 --> 26:41.034
-No.
-No.
-No.

26:41.067 --> 26:42.136
-No.
-Nope.

26:42.172 --> 26:43.550
-Uh, no.
-KALIMBA: No?

26:43.586 --> 26:45.862
-No?
-That's a negatory.
-Check is no good.

26:45.895 --> 26:47.723
[groans]
What? What is it?

26:47.758 --> 26:49.619
Oh, that has to be
so frustrating.

26:49.654 --> 26:50.895
HANGER:
Everything's detail.

26:50.931 --> 26:52.895
MIKE:
I'm just looking down at it.

26:52.931 --> 26:55.964
And I'm like, "The records."
He needs those on there to play.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.619
So I put those on there.
I'm like, "I think I got it."

26:58.654 --> 27:00.413
It's definitely got to be it.

27:00.448 --> 27:02.964
Mike calling
for his third inspection.

27:04.136 --> 27:06.654
And has Mike
finally got it right?

27:08.481 --> 27:10.586
Let's see.

27:10.619 --> 27:13.103
-[records scratch]
-Yeah!

27:13.136 --> 27:15.550
-KEOGHAN: And Mike
gets the job done!
-[cheering]

27:15.586 --> 27:17.586
-Yes! [whoops]
-Yeah!

27:17.619 --> 27:18.895
Oh, yes!

27:18.931 --> 27:20.586
-[shouts]
-HANGER: Yes!

27:20.619 --> 27:22.689
This is amazing. I felt
like I couldn't even stand up,

27:22.723 --> 27:24.413
I was so happy.

27:24.448 --> 27:26.826
Dawg. Man, you got that.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.964
MIKE:
I won, and I'm still
in contention

27:29.000 --> 27:30.517
for the $200,000.

27:30.550 --> 27:32.689
-I was stunned.
-You did it, man.

27:32.723 --> 27:33.895
KEOGHAN:
Everybody, keep going.

27:33.931 --> 27:35.689
You're fighting
to stay out of overtime.

27:35.723 --> 27:37.413
DJ GRAVITY ONE:
I think everybody's seeing
what somebody else does

27:37.448 --> 27:39.136
and, like,
"Oh, I'm gonna steal that move."

27:39.172 --> 27:41.275
Okay,
I'm not going to the Grammys.

27:41.309 --> 27:43.378
Now it's to the survival mode.

27:43.413 --> 27:45.550
And, whoa,

27:45.586 --> 27:48.172
Alfie drops his mic
just in front of Lia.

27:48.205 --> 27:50.723
-That was sneaky.
-ALFIE: I have no intentions

27:50.758 --> 27:52.034
of going into overtime.

27:52.067 --> 27:54.413
KEOGHAN:
Alfie, he would love
this to be over.

27:55.448 --> 27:57.586
-It is not over.
-Damn.

27:57.619 --> 28:00.034
Make a trip.
Go get them details right.

28:00.067 --> 28:01.826
KEOGHAN:
Next check goes to Lia.

28:01.862 --> 28:04.344
Oh, she wants this bad.

28:06.413 --> 28:09.895
-[record scratches]
-And Lyrical Lia!

28:09.931 --> 28:11.723
Thank you.

28:11.758 --> 28:13.654
-[Keoghan whoops]
-[Kelsy laughs]

28:13.689 --> 28:15.481
I was relieved

28:15.517 --> 28:17.275
I didn't have to go
into overtime.

28:17.309 --> 28:18.309
Yahoo.

28:18.344 --> 28:20.172
That's it. That's all you get.

28:20.205 --> 28:22.689
This journey
has definitely energized me.

28:22.723 --> 28:24.309
I can't wait to see what's next.

28:24.344 --> 28:27.136
Look at everything, guys.
Look at everything.

28:27.172 --> 28:30.378
KEOGHAN:
Mike and Lia safe from overtime.
The rest of you

28:30.413 --> 28:33.034
do not want to get cut
from the individual competition.

28:33.067 --> 28:34.895
Quincey running back
from the lobby.

28:34.931 --> 28:36.103
He's just done a quick check.

28:36.136 --> 28:38.205
QUINCEY:
I'm a mechanic, and people,

28:38.240 --> 28:40.136
they operate stuff by you,
so I have to be precise.

28:40.172 --> 28:42.723
This DJ booth test,
it ties into that

28:42.758 --> 28:45.344
because I got to do this thing
right the first time.

28:46.344 --> 28:47.792
KEOGHAN:
Jerome drops a mic.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.481
What do we think,
DJ Gravity One?

28:51.517 --> 28:53.067
Has Jerome done the job?

28:53.103 --> 28:54.826
-And no.
-KEOGHAN: Check is no good.

28:54.862 --> 28:56.792
I give up. I-I'll go overtime.

28:56.826 --> 28:58.205
What did he say?
What did he say?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.792
Don't say that, dawg.
Don't say that. Nah, come on.

28:59.826 --> 29:01.654
-Keep fighting. Keep fighting.
-You got to be a good sport.

29:01.689 --> 29:03.931
-Don't give up, Jerome.
-JEROME: I was ready for quit,

29:03.964 --> 29:05.619
take my chances at overtime,

29:05.654 --> 29:07.758
but everyone was saying,
"Brother, you ain't quitting."

29:07.792 --> 29:09.034
CHRISTINE:
Jerome, look at everybody else.

29:09.067 --> 29:11.448
JEROME:
Needs vinyl on top.

29:11.481 --> 29:13.309
-There you go, brother.
-SARAH: Stay out of overtime.

29:13.344 --> 29:15.619
That's not even like me.
I'm usually so calm.

29:15.654 --> 29:18.103
Was one little detail
that got to me.

29:18.136 --> 29:19.205
Hustle here, guys.

29:20.172 --> 29:23.792
And Jerome drops his mic
for a check.

29:23.826 --> 29:25.826
Will Jerome be safe?

29:28.481 --> 29:31.344
JEROME:
Was excruciating
waiting for the results.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.723
You're just there standing
around like a sitting duck.

29:34.826 --> 29:37.205
-[record scratches]
-We're good.

29:37.240 --> 29:39.550
KEOGHAN:
Jerome gets the job done!
Jerome!

29:39.586 --> 29:41.309
JEROME:
Thank you, God.

29:41.344 --> 29:42.413
Leave one other day.

29:42.448 --> 29:43.517
Congrats, brother.

29:43.550 --> 29:44.826
KEOGHAN:
Just four left.

29:44.862 --> 29:48.344
Alfie, Tak,
Elizabeth and Quincey.

29:48.378 --> 29:50.964
Whatever you can do,
do not go into overtime.

29:51.000 --> 29:52.826
Couple people,
their music has gone off.

29:52.862 --> 29:55.172
Smoke everywhere. Yay, party.

29:55.205 --> 29:56.792
It's not a party in my mind.

29:56.826 --> 29:59.550
KEOGHAN:
Alfie drops his mic
one more time

29:59.586 --> 30:01.792
looking for a check, and...

30:01.826 --> 30:03.344
No-go over here.

30:03.378 --> 30:05.067
-God.
-No-go.

30:05.103 --> 30:06.792
ALFIE:
What is it?

30:06.826 --> 30:09.758
Anxiety kicks in,
doubt kicks in.

30:09.792 --> 30:11.034
What am I missing?

30:11.067 --> 30:13.000
What is it, Lord? Show me.

30:18.792 --> 30:19.895
Four of you left.

30:19.931 --> 30:21.862
Remember, the last two
of you to finish

30:21.895 --> 30:23.517
will be heading to overtime.

30:23.550 --> 30:26.103
Elizabeth,
going for her first check.

30:30.067 --> 30:33.205
Queen Eliza-Beat gets the job
done and stays out of overtime!

30:33.240 --> 30:35.413
ELIZABETH:
I escaped overtime.

30:35.448 --> 30:38.067
It just goes to show you how
tight the room for error is.

30:38.103 --> 30:40.895
There are three left,
two of you going into overtime.

30:40.931 --> 30:44.067
Will it be Alfie,
Tak or Quincey?

30:44.103 --> 30:46.344
I want to be a star on the stage
today. I don't want to lose.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.689
Next up,
Quincey has his first check.

30:48.723 --> 30:50.586
I've just got to stay out
of overtime now.

30:51.550 --> 30:52.895
And it's no good.

30:52.931 --> 30:55.034
KEOGHAN:
No good for Quincey.

30:55.067 --> 30:56.964
It's anybody's game right now.

30:57.000 --> 30:58.309
KEOGHAN: Tak is looking
at Jerome's set up.

30:58.344 --> 31:00.103
I was panicking
and I was rushing.

31:00.136 --> 31:01.723
Look at the differences.

31:01.758 --> 31:03.378
TAK:
I see that my turntable was

31:03.413 --> 31:05.309
positioned a different way
from theirs,

31:05.344 --> 31:07.275
so I knew I had to fix it.

31:07.309 --> 31:08.413
Good eye, good eye!

31:08.448 --> 31:11.000
Tak comes in to drop a mic.

31:11.034 --> 31:12.723
A three-way race.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.344
Tak, desperately wanting
to stay out of overtime.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.103
DJ Gravity One drops
a needle...

31:22.136 --> 31:23.862
and we have scratching!

31:23.895 --> 31:26.792
Thumbs up for Tak,
and Tak is out of overtime!

31:29.481 --> 31:32.172
TAK:
At work, I learned
that you have to stay calm,

31:32.205 --> 31:35.136
and so I just thought
about my family back home.

31:35.172 --> 31:36.654
I miss my family a lot.

31:36.689 --> 31:38.481
Incredibly intense competition.

31:38.517 --> 31:39.758
Alfie, Quincey, you will be

31:39.792 --> 31:42.067
going head-to-head
into overtime.

31:42.103 --> 31:44.895
If you finish last you will
be cut from the competition,

31:44.931 --> 31:45.964
you'll lose your shot
at that title.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.448
Before we go,

31:47.481 --> 31:49.000
I do want to thank
DJ Gravity One.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.034
[cheering, clamoring]

31:51.067 --> 31:53.723
-All right,
let's get to overtime.
-Good job, everybody.

31:53.758 --> 31:56.378
QUINCEY:
I feel nervous now
going into overtime.

31:56.413 --> 31:58.103
I've been there before,
but I'm going up against Alfie.

31:58.136 --> 32:00.378
And Alfie is
a superintendent, he has

32:00.413 --> 32:01.862
to pay close attention
to detail.

32:01.895 --> 32:03.654
I was about to lose my marbles.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.344
But I'm not going to give up.

32:05.378 --> 32:07.275
I represent Lamar,
uh, South Carolina.

32:07.309 --> 32:08.964
I want to let the kids
in Lamar know that,

32:09.000 --> 32:10.034
get out there and do things.

32:10.067 --> 32:11.619
And I want to be
a perfect example.

32:11.654 --> 32:13.103
You can do it, all right?

32:13.136 --> 32:14.723
-You got this, right?
You got this.
-I'm ready.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.689
-Yeah.
-Going into overtime,

32:16.723 --> 32:19.000
I rely on my skill sets,

32:19.034 --> 32:21.689
but most of all, the fire that's
in my heart for my future.

32:21.723 --> 32:23.689
I know that God had
a purpose for me.

32:23.723 --> 32:25.895
I had a moment when I was
laying in that hospital bed

32:25.931 --> 32:28.034
after a couple weeks
and I said,

32:28.067 --> 32:30.034
"Lord, what am
I supposed to be doing?

32:30.067 --> 32:32.723
"What do you want? Where am
I supposed to go? Tell me.

32:32.758 --> 32:35.344
Because obviously you keep
saving my life for something."

32:35.378 --> 32:37.586
I don't know,
but I'm pursuing it

32:37.619 --> 32:39.344
with everything I got,

32:39.378 --> 32:42.136
because to me
I got a second chance in life.

32:44.826 --> 32:48.000
[cheering, clamoring]

32:50.240 --> 32:51.448
KEOGHAN:
Alfie and Quincey,

32:51.481 --> 32:54.619
welcome to overtime.

32:54.654 --> 32:55.895
Look at this beautiful building.

32:55.931 --> 32:58.103
-Oh, yeah!
-The neon comes out,

32:58.136 --> 33:00.240
starts to light up, and...

33:00.275 --> 33:02.172
you guys are going
to put a message up here

33:02.205 --> 33:03.964
that is going
to go out to the world.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.964
They've estimated that 30,000

33:07.000 --> 33:10.000
people read the message
that's up on this marquee

33:10.034 --> 33:11.654
every day.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.103
Inside each
of these bins is a plan

33:14.136 --> 33:16.136
showing the letters
that need to go up

33:16.172 --> 33:17.931
on the marquee,
"Tough As Nails.

33:17.964 --> 33:19.344
Time to get to work."

33:19.378 --> 33:21.413
You can place the words
anywhere on the marquee,

33:21.448 --> 33:23.240
but pay careful attention

33:23.275 --> 33:24.895
to the spacing
between the words.

33:24.931 --> 33:26.309
It's got to be precise.

33:26.344 --> 33:28.205
All the letters you need
to get the job done

33:28.240 --> 33:29.964
are inside this case.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.136
When the work whistle goes,
you'll be using

33:32.172 --> 33:34.550
one of these extendable arms.

33:34.586 --> 33:36.000
These little pincers pick
up the letters.

33:36.034 --> 33:37.895
You grab your letters,
you lift them up,

33:37.931 --> 33:40.103
and you hook them up
onto the marquee.

33:40.136 --> 33:42.689
Same number of letters,
same words.

33:42.723 --> 33:45.034
Going head-to-head
as fast as you can.

33:45.067 --> 33:46.758
The first one to get it
done

33:46.792 --> 33:49.619
will be joining our other five
to be in the final six.

33:49.654 --> 33:51.172
If you finish last,

33:51.205 --> 33:52.895
you'll be punching out.

33:52.931 --> 33:54.931
-You ready to go to work?
-Let's go, guys.

33:54.964 --> 33:56.240
-[cheering, clamoring]
-Let's do it!

33:56.275 --> 33:58.517
ALFIE:
It's all on the line right here,

33:58.550 --> 34:00.792
and so now it gets real serious,
you know, it's...

34:00.826 --> 34:03.378
a matter of life and death,
it's a matter of freedom to me.

34:03.413 --> 34:05.000
It's a matter of my future.

34:05.034 --> 34:07.550
Jump-starting it or working
till the day I die.

34:07.586 --> 34:09.757
QUINCEY:
I'm definitely feeling
the pressure, you know?

34:09.793 --> 34:11.413
There's $200,000 on the line.

34:11.447 --> 34:13.309
I got to go in
completely focused

34:13.344 --> 34:14.931
with a hot heart and cool head.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.550
This to stay in contention
for the Tough As Nailstitle.

34:19.447 --> 34:20.724
And on the work whistle.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.862
-[work whistle blows]
-[cheering, clamoring]

34:24.931 --> 34:26.931
[whooping]

34:26.965 --> 34:28.931
KEOGHAN:
Putting those letters out quick!

34:28.965 --> 34:30.619
Everything they need to know is

34:30.655 --> 34:32.000
on the lid of their box.

34:32.034 --> 34:33.550
The exact configuration.

34:33.585 --> 34:36.103
-There you go, Quince.
-There you go!

34:36.137 --> 34:37.793
QUINCEY:
Work whistle blows,
and I'm thinking

34:37.827 --> 34:39.827
lay out the sentences
that I have to put on there.

34:39.862 --> 34:42.172
"Tough As Nails.
Time to get to work."

34:43.481 --> 34:45.378
KELSY:
Way to go, Alfie!

34:45.413 --> 34:47.240
KEOGHAN:
Two different strategies!

34:47.275 --> 34:50.413
Quincey's taking the time
to spell out the entire message.

34:50.447 --> 34:52.516
Alfie's deciding to get going.

34:52.550 --> 34:54.655
-Good job, good job.
-Take your time.
Take your time, you guys.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.757
When I face something
that I haven't done,

34:56.793 --> 34:58.688
I'm confident in my ability.

34:58.724 --> 35:00.413
KEOGHAN:
Do you see the hooks
on the ends of the letter?

35:00.447 --> 35:02.757
Get those over the middle bar

35:02.793 --> 35:04.757
and it's very hard
to line them up.

35:04.793 --> 35:07.378
My strategy is
don't overthink it.

35:07.413 --> 35:09.585
Don't try to make it
what it's not.

35:09.619 --> 35:10.724
Keep it moving.

35:10.757 --> 35:12.550
KEOGHAN:
And Alfie

35:12.585 --> 35:14.516
with the first letter
up on the marquee.

35:14.550 --> 35:16.378
LIA:
Yeah!

35:16.413 --> 35:17.793
KALIMBA:
Come on, Quince, just keep
doing what you're doing,

35:17.827 --> 35:21.240
-just-- I like it.
-LIA: Spelling it out. Good job.

35:21.275 --> 35:24.550
Quincey's my Dirty Hands
brother, so...

35:24.585 --> 35:28.793
kind of cringing because
he's a bit of a perfectionist.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.965
-Give yourself room!
-And so he's taking his time.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.447
Come on, come on!

35:32.481 --> 35:35.309
-And Alfie's--
-You're doing good!

35:35.344 --> 35:37.447
many more letters are going up.

35:37.481 --> 35:40.309
Way to go, Alfie. Way to go!

35:43.344 --> 35:45.103
[Quincey groans]

35:45.137 --> 35:47.793
KEOGHAN:
Quincey is taking his time and
paying a little more attention.

35:47.827 --> 35:49.862
JEROME:
Get in there!

35:49.896 --> 35:51.862
Trying to get that dexterity,
but you see

35:51.896 --> 35:53.724
how it's just slipping
out of the pincers.

35:53.757 --> 35:55.447
-Yeah.
-Got to get that angle, bruddah.

35:55.481 --> 35:57.240
QUINCEY:
I'm trying
to get the dexterity

35:57.275 --> 35:58.965
of the gripper to--
on the letter.

35:59.000 --> 36:00.724
-There you go.
-Good job, bruddah.

36:00.757 --> 36:02.034
The letters are slick, you know?

36:02.068 --> 36:04.309
So it's starting
to slip a little bit.

36:04.344 --> 36:07.585
KEOGHAN:
Oh, and "G" comes down!

36:07.619 --> 36:09.103
Don't let it get to you.
You got it.

36:09.137 --> 36:11.103
QUINCEY:
I've never used
one of those tools before,

36:11.137 --> 36:13.965
as a mechanic,
but it's almost like my job

36:14.000 --> 36:17.516
because it's tedious
and you got to take your time.

36:17.550 --> 36:19.619
-[groans]
-Quincey is slow

36:19.655 --> 36:22.275
and steady trying to get
the word "Tough" spelled out.

36:22.309 --> 36:24.172
-KELSY:
You're doing good, Alfie!
-KEOGHAN: Meanwhile,

36:24.206 --> 36:26.068
Alfie's on his second line.

36:26.103 --> 36:28.068
Look at your spaces,
pay careful attention

36:28.103 --> 36:30.103
to the distance
between the words.

36:30.137 --> 36:32.344
Do this one time only.

36:32.378 --> 36:33.481
Ooh, this is going to be tough.

36:33.516 --> 36:35.413
Alfie with the "T-O"
of "tough" up.

36:35.447 --> 36:37.378
Pay attention to details.

36:37.413 --> 36:39.172
Alfie just threw
all the letters up,

36:39.206 --> 36:41.862
and he just is
gonna see that they just

36:41.896 --> 36:43.275
were not spaced correctly.

36:43.309 --> 36:44.724
QUINCEY:
I'm not looking at Alfie, but

36:44.757 --> 36:46.275
I hear he's way ahead of me.

36:46.309 --> 36:47.413
-ELIZABETH: Yeah!
-[Quincey groans]

36:47.447 --> 36:49.344
I'm thinking, "Oh, God.

36:49.378 --> 36:50.757
This could be it."

36:50.793 --> 36:52.000
I could be punching out today.

36:54.206 --> 36:55.585
KEOGHAN:
Oh, and the "S" comes down!

36:55.619 --> 36:58.137
LIA:
You own that "S," Quincey.
You own it!

37:04.137 --> 37:05.481
[Quincey groaning]

37:05.516 --> 37:07.688
KEOGHAN:
Oh, and the "S" comes down!

37:07.724 --> 37:09.240
That's all right.
Take your time, bruddah.

37:10.619 --> 37:13.862
Alfie has "Tough As...
Time to get to work."

37:13.896 --> 37:15.550
He's got to get "Nails"up.

37:15.585 --> 37:18.000
ALFIE:
As a superintendent,
reading prints,

37:18.034 --> 37:19.172
that's what I've done
all my life.

37:19.206 --> 37:21.965
Those details, in any industry,

37:22.000 --> 37:23.378
do make
a win or a loss situation.

37:23.413 --> 37:25.275
KEOGHAN:
Look at your spaces.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.309
Placement, Alfie, placement!

37:27.344 --> 37:30.240
Quincey, still working
on "Tough As."

37:30.275 --> 37:32.516
TAK:
Quincey, you still in this.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.516
He's way ahead of me,
but I'm not gonna stop.

37:34.550 --> 37:36.965
-LIA: Ah, beautiful.
-KELSY: Way to go, Quincey,
that's perfect.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.481
Until Phil say,
"Hey, game is over, Alfie wins,"

37:39.516 --> 37:40.655
I'm gonna continue to work.

37:42.206 --> 37:43.309
-[cheering, clamoring]
-KEOGHAN: That's a good move.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.585
Quincey's getting
the hang of this.

37:44.619 --> 37:45.896
LIA:
Nailed it, brother!

37:45.931 --> 37:48.481
Alfie's trying to fix
the end of "Nails."

37:48.516 --> 37:49.344
ALFIE:
I'm sweating.

37:49.378 --> 37:50.862
Forearms on fire.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.550
Oh!

37:52.585 --> 37:54.827
-Come on.
-Aah!

37:54.862 --> 37:58.481
Oh, and down comes
the "I" from Alfie!

37:58.516 --> 38:00.240
There you go, right there, yep.

38:00.275 --> 38:03.068
-Looking good, looking good.
-[cheering, clamoring]

38:04.000 --> 38:06.931
Quincey's moving down
onto his second row.

38:06.965 --> 38:08.447
He has his "Tough As Nails"up.

38:08.481 --> 38:11.447
Like anybody on a job site,
follow your plans.

38:11.481 --> 38:13.862
-Come on, Alfie. Come on.
-No way!

38:13.896 --> 38:14.757
Oh, yes!

38:14.793 --> 38:16.206
I'm done.

38:16.240 --> 38:17.931
No, I'm sorry,

38:17.965 --> 38:19.965
Alfie, you need
to make some adjustments.

38:20.000 --> 38:22.172
-Check your prints, man!
-Check your plans!

38:22.206 --> 38:23.724
[overlapping shouting]

38:23.757 --> 38:26.931
KEOGHAN: Look at your spaces.
This is a job of precision.

38:26.965 --> 38:28.965
Focus on them details, Alfie.

38:30.000 --> 38:31.793
Oh, no.

38:31.827 --> 38:34.585
I start trying
to grab the letters again

38:34.619 --> 38:36.034
and move them over.

38:36.068 --> 38:37.862
KEOGHAN:
Alfie has spotted one mistake

38:37.896 --> 38:39.793
and he's moving it, but his "S"
is coming down

38:39.827 --> 38:41.724
and so is his "O."

38:41.757 --> 38:44.378
All of a sudden two
or three fall off the marquee.

38:44.413 --> 38:48.000
Oh, and down comes
the "N" for "Nails."

38:48.034 --> 38:50.757
I'm hearing Alfie having trouble
with his letters falling off.

38:50.793 --> 38:52.655
You still have a chance,
Quincey.

38:52.688 --> 38:55.034
-Just keep it cool.
-LIA: Keep it steady!

38:55.068 --> 38:57.862
KEOGHAN:
You can see even Quincey,
as strong as he is,

38:57.896 --> 39:00.378
-is quivering
with that long line.
-Give me an "O"!

39:00.413 --> 39:01.724
-And he gets it.
-Yes!

39:01.757 --> 39:03.896
-There you go!
-[cheering, clamoring]

39:03.931 --> 39:05.896
Alfie, getting the "N" attached
to the top line.

39:05.931 --> 39:07.378
-Check.
-Good!

39:07.413 --> 39:08.688
KEOGHAN:
No!

39:08.724 --> 39:10.688
Alfie, I'm sorry to tell you,
you still have

39:10.724 --> 39:12.516
one detail
that you need to deal with.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.137
Check your marquee.

39:14.172 --> 39:16.068
You got it, you got it, Alfie.

39:16.103 --> 39:19.793
-One thing left.
-My spacing is still not right.

39:19.827 --> 39:23.000
I'm very discouraged
at this point.

39:23.034 --> 39:26.378
-Look at everything.
-"T-O-U-G-H" in the middle.

39:26.413 --> 39:28.931
KEOGHAN:
For both of you,
spacing between your words

39:28.965 --> 39:30.447
should be consistent.

39:30.481 --> 39:32.724
I'm trying to see
what it is that he sees...

39:32.757 --> 39:35.103
-Come on, man.
-I'm sorry!

39:35.137 --> 39:37.103
-...because I don't see it.
-Come on, Alfie.

39:37.137 --> 39:39.481
-Easy.
-Don't worry, easy, easy.

39:39.516 --> 39:41.206
KEOGHAN:
Quincey is getting
the "K" of his "work" up.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.965
You got 'em, you got 'em, you
got 'em, you got 'em! Let it go.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.172
Quincey's now caught up,

39:45.206 --> 39:47.034
He's got all the words up.

39:47.068 --> 39:48.724
Run through every letter!

39:48.757 --> 39:50.034
This is gonna come
down to spacing.

39:50.068 --> 39:51.034
One word!

39:51.068 --> 39:52.655
If you get this right you stay

39:52.688 --> 39:54.827
in contention for
the Tough As Nailstitle.

39:54.862 --> 39:57.034
Make it look exactly
like the print!

39:57.068 --> 39:58.931
Yes, Alfie!

39:58.965 --> 39:59.757
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

39:59.793 --> 40:00.688
Just focus on the detail!

40:00.724 --> 40:01.757
You still get 'em.

40:01.793 --> 40:03.550
Oh, nice.

40:03.585 --> 40:05.206
KEOGHAN:
Quincey, tapping
the "H" on his "tough."

40:05.240 --> 40:06.688
Now check!

40:06.724 --> 40:08.068
QUINCEY:
Check!

40:08.103 --> 40:09.378
LIA:
Good job, Alfie.

40:09.413 --> 40:11.000
Quincey gets the job done!

40:12.585 --> 40:14.516
[cheering, clamoring]

40:14.550 --> 40:16.862
Alfie, your mistake is
on the second line.

40:16.896 --> 40:19.275
-That was a tough one, you guys.
-Check the spacing between "get"

40:19.309 --> 40:21.206
-and "to."
-I love you, Alfie.

40:22.896 --> 40:24.655
QUINCEY:
I guess I'm the new

40:24.688 --> 40:27.447
"OT OG," now as they say
out here on Tough As Nails.

40:27.481 --> 40:29.206
[indistinct chatter]

40:29.240 --> 40:30.688
I'm glad I won,

40:30.724 --> 40:32.344
but I'm still
up against competitors

40:32.378 --> 40:34.275
that want it just
as bad as I do, so

40:34.309 --> 40:36.550
I just got to just remember
to remain calm, remain humble,

40:36.585 --> 40:38.240
and, uh, bring
my A game every time.

40:38.275 --> 40:39.344
KEOGHAN:
I want to commend both of you

40:39.378 --> 40:40.896
for putting in such hard work.

40:40.931 --> 40:43.550
Alfie, you did so well,
and it really was just

40:43.585 --> 40:45.550
one detail at the end.

40:45.585 --> 40:47.034
Quincey, you were so far behind.

40:47.068 --> 40:48.655
Did you look across
and just think

40:48.688 --> 40:51.068
this is all over before
you even get started?

40:51.103 --> 40:52.965
I was thinking about,
you know, my, my wife and I was

40:53.000 --> 40:54.827
thinking about my kids
and my parents, you know?

40:54.862 --> 40:57.413
This is a time for me
to make them proud, you know,

40:57.447 --> 40:59.550
and they were my drive today.

40:59.585 --> 41:02.309
-Yeah.
-Good job, brother.

41:02.344 --> 41:05.481
And now, Alfie, your focus is
gonna become all about team.

41:05.516 --> 41:06.793
That's right.

41:06.827 --> 41:08.688
You punch out
of the individual competition,

41:08.724 --> 41:10.688
you do not punch
out of Tough As Nails.

41:10.724 --> 41:13.000
And there's still a shot
for you guys to win that team

41:13.034 --> 41:15.481
competition, and now it is
more important than ever.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.655
Alfie, I'm sorry

41:17.688 --> 41:19.516
to tell you that I do need you
to punch out.

41:21.619 --> 41:23.619
-Love you.
-[applause]

41:23.655 --> 41:26.931
ALFIE:
I gave it my all here today.

41:26.965 --> 41:28.309
That's all I know how to do.

41:29.550 --> 41:30.896
-Proud of you, Alfie.
-Love you, Alfie.

41:34.481 --> 41:36.724
ALFIE:
I got to thank God
that I'm even here.

41:36.757 --> 41:39.516
I'm forever grateful for that
'cause I can see my children

41:39.550 --> 41:41.103
grow up and be a grandparent.

41:41.137 --> 41:43.688
I'll sleep this off
and know that I serve

41:43.724 --> 41:45.137
a bigger purpose than myself.

41:45.172 --> 41:47.172
Savage Crew is gonna win

41:47.206 --> 41:50.240
the team competition
and take that 60,000 home.

41:50.275 --> 41:52.827
All right,
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:53.827 --> 41:55.585
-Good job.
-Good job.
We've got plans after this.

41:55.619 --> 41:57.206
You know,
we're gonna keep going.

41:57.240 --> 41:58.896
-I love these guys, man.
-I do, too.

41:58.931 --> 42:00.827
Everybody here, man.

42:00.862 --> 42:02.896
I, I couldn't cheer
because I love them both.

42:02.931 --> 42:04.481
Romy, thank you, man!

42:04.516 --> 42:06.344
Yeah, man.
Thank you for the support.

42:19.550 --> 42:22.550
KEOGHAN: The most important
team challenge so far

42:22.585 --> 42:23.827
in the competition.

42:23.862 --> 42:25.240
Dirty Hands, you're up 4-3.

42:25.275 --> 42:27.481
If they take it,
they take the 60,000.

42:27.516 --> 42:29.206
KEOGHAN:
Reseal this parking lot.

42:29.240 --> 42:30.688
Move, move, move.

42:30.724 --> 42:32.275
Stay with the paintbrush!

42:32.309 --> 42:33.688
I am fixing your mistakes!

42:33.724 --> 42:35.862
We are a hot mess.

42:35.896 --> 42:39.103
KEOGHAN:
Today your job is
to paint parking spots.

42:39.137 --> 42:40.931
Man, this is coming
down to seconds.

42:40.965 --> 42:42.344
KEOGHAN:
This is the time to bring it.
