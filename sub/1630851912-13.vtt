And‐and‐and‐a‐a‐and

21:53.021 --> 21:56.024
we should do a movie
about flaming meatballs

21:56.024 --> 21:57.568
that are superheroes!

21:57.568 --> 22:01.405
So, one day, a giant meatball
crashes into the Earth,

22:01.405 --> 22:03.615
and a baby
meatball comes out of it,

22:03.615 --> 22:05.951
which is totally different from Superman.

22:05.951 --> 22:07.619
And then, he grows up

22:07.619 --> 22:09.872
and finds other warm, delicious meatballs,

22:09.872 --> 22:12.708
and they can have their
own superpowers, too!

22:12.708 --> 22:14.209
Then, this bad guy,

a super‐snowball!

22:25.345 --> 22:26.972
But out of meat.

22:26.972 --> 22:29.141
Which brings us back to meatballs,

Stew‐icide Squad,
