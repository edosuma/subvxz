WEBVTT

00:05.320 --> 00:08.915
- What the hell is he doing?
- The controls aren't working.

00:09.200 --> 00:11.794
I don't know where we're going,
but my old hand's very excited about it.

00:11.880 --> 00:14.314
I thought that was just some
freaky alien thing.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.470
- Are you sure that it's yours?
- Well...

00:16.560 --> 00:22.078
- It got cut off. He grew a new one.
- You are completely impossible.

00:22.560 --> 00:25.472
I'm not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.

00:42.400 --> 00:46.154
- Why did the Tardis bring us here?
- Oh, I love this bit.

00:46.240 --> 00:50.074
- I thought you wanted to go home.
- I know, but all the same...

00:50.600 --> 00:52.795
- It's that feeling you get.
- Like you swallowed a hamster.

00:52.880 --> 00:54.836
Don't move. Stay where you are!

00:54.920 --> 00:56.558
- Drop your weapons!
- We're not armed.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.790
Look, no weapons,
never any weapons. We're safe.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.317
- Look at their hands. They're clean.
- All right, process them. Him first.

01:04.720 --> 01:08.349
Wait! Oi! What's wrong with clean hands?

01:08.440 --> 01:09.793
What's going on?
Leave him alone.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.596
Something tells me this isn't about
to check my blood pressure.

01:15.760 --> 01:18.194
- What are you doing to him?
- Everyone gets processed.

01:18.280 --> 01:19.838
It's taking a tissue sample.

01:19.920 --> 01:22.354
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

01:22.680 --> 01:26.150
An extrapolator here.
Some kind of accelerator?

01:29.560 --> 01:33.030
- Are you all right?
I don't know.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.994
That's...

01:47.640 --> 01:49.073
Arm yourself.

01:50.720 --> 01:53.553
Where did she come from?
- From me.

01:54.320 --> 01:56.880
- From you?
- How?

01:57.720 --> 02:00.188
- Who is she?
Well, she's...

02:01.120 --> 02:02.314
Well...

02:03.760 --> 02:05.432
She's my daughter.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.318
Hello, Dad.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.388
Are you primed to take orders,
ready to fight?

02:48.480 --> 02:50.835
Instant mental download of all
strategic and military protocol, sir.

02:50.920 --> 02:53.388
Generation 5000 soldier, primed
and in peak physical health.

02:53.480 --> 02:55.630
Oh, I'm ready.

02:56.480 --> 02:59.950
- Did you say daughter?
- Mmm. Technically.

03:00.040 --> 03:01.314
Technically how?

03:01.400 --> 03:04.198
Progenation,
reproduction from a single organism.

03:04.280 --> 03:06.953
It means one parent is biological
mother and father.

03:07.040 --> 03:09.156
You take a sample of diploid cells,
split them into haploids,

03:09.240 --> 03:12.437
then recombine them in
a different arrangement and grow,

03:12.520 --> 03:13.748
very quickly, apparently.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.070
Something's coming.

03:20.160 --> 03:23.197
It's the Hath!
- Get down!

03:31.440 --> 03:34.159
We have to blow the tunnel.
Get the detonator!

03:34.240 --> 03:36.470
We're not detonating anything.

03:46.760 --> 03:47.988
Grab it!

03:48.080 --> 03:50.469
Blow the thing!
- Martha!

03:50.720 --> 03:51.835
No. Don't!

04:11.760 --> 04:15.469
You've sealed off the tunnel.
Why did you do that?

04:15.880 --> 04:18.235
- They were trying to kill us.
- But they've got my friend.

04:18.320 --> 04:19.878
Collateral damage.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.837
At least you've still got her.
He lost both his men.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.071
- I'd say you came out ahead.
- Her name is Martha.

04:25.280 --> 04:27.874
And she's not collateral damage,
not for anyone.

04:27.960 --> 04:30.713
Have you got that, GI Jane?

04:32.080 --> 04:34.640
- I'm gonna find her.
- You're going nowhere.

04:34.720 --> 04:38.793
You don't make sense, you two.
No guns, no marks, no fight in you.

04:39.960 --> 04:42.713
I'm taking you to General Cobb.
Now move.

05:05.880 --> 05:10.112
Hold on. I've got you.
Is it your arm, yeah?

05:12.320 --> 05:13.753
Is that a yes?

05:16.120 --> 05:18.475
Let me examine it. Keep still.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.713
Still, yeah?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.108
No move.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.951
Half fish, half human.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.911
How am I supposed to know?
Is that a shoulder?

05:34.240 --> 05:37.198
Feels like a shoulder.
I think it's dislocated.

05:42.360 --> 05:44.271
I'm trying to help him.

05:45.040 --> 05:49.352
I am a doctor and he is my patient.
And I'm not leaving him.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.231
Now this is gonna hurt.

05:56.560 --> 06:00.030
One, two, three!

06:13.000 --> 06:17.949
Now then, I'm Dr Martha Jones.
Who the hell are you?

06:18.960 --> 06:21.110
I'm Donna. What's your name?

06:21.680 --> 06:24.114
Don't know. It's not been assigned.

06:24.200 --> 06:27.237
Well, if you don't know that,
what do you know?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.911
- How to fight.
- Nothing else?

06:30.000 --> 06:33.993
The machine must embed military
history and tactics, but no name.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.199
- She's a generated anomaly.
- "Generated anomaly"?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.592
Generated.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.635
Well, what about that? Jenny.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.637
Jenny. Yeah. I like that. Jenny.

06:48.240 --> 06:51.915
- What do you think, Dad?
- Good as anything, I suppose.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.479
You're not what you call
a natural parent, are you?

06:53.560 --> 06:55.755
They stole a tissue sample at gunpoint
and processed it.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.353
It's not what I'd call
natural parenting.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.874
Rubbish. My friend Neris
fathered twins using a turkey baster.

06:59.960 --> 07:00.995
It don't bother her.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.230
Can I extrapolate a relationship
from a biological accident?

07:03.320 --> 07:04.639
Uh, Child Support Agency can.

07:04.720 --> 07:06.676
Look, just 'cause I share
certain physiological traits

07:06.760 --> 07:09.433
with simian primates doesn't make me
a monkey's uncle, does it?

07:09.520 --> 07:13.559
I'm not a monkey... or a child.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.911
- So where are we? What planet's this?
- Messaline. Well, what's left of it.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.073
<i>6-6-3, 75 deceased.</i>

07:25.440 --> 07:29.399
<i>Generation 6-6-7-1 extinct.</i>

07:30.480 --> 07:33.392
<i>Generation 6-6-7-2,</i>

07:33.480 --> 07:35.675
<i>46 deceased.</i>

07:36.680 --> 07:39.194
<i>Generation 6-6-8-0,</i>

07:39.800 --> 07:41.836
<i>14 deceased.</i>

07:42.800 --> 07:44.358
<i>Generation 6...</i>

07:44.440 --> 07:47.955
<i>- This is a theatre.
- Maybe they're doing Miss Saigon.</i>

07:48.320 --> 07:52.154
It's like a town or a city underground.

07:52.720 --> 07:54.870
- But why?
- General Cobb, I presume.

07:54.960 --> 07:58.430
Found in the western tunnels, I'm told,
with no marks.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.112
There was an outbreak of pacifism

08:00.200 --> 08:03.988
in the eastern zone, three generations
back, before we lost contact.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.513
Is that where you came from?

08:05.600 --> 08:08.990
Eastern zone, that's us. Yeah, yeah.
I'm the Doctor. This is Donna.

08:09.080 --> 08:10.069
And I'm Jenny.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.913
Don't think you can infect us
with your peacemaking.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.877
We're committed to the fight
to the very end.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.713
Well, that's all right. I can't stay
anyway. I gotta go and find my friend.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.552
That's not possible.
All movement is regulated.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.950
- We're at war.
- Yes. I noticed. With the Hath.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.149
But tell me,
'cause we got a bit out of circulation,

08:26.240 --> 08:29.710
eastern zone and all that,
so who exactly are the Hath?

09:04.760 --> 09:06.671
Back at the dawn of this planet,

09:06.760 --> 09:10.196
these ancient halls
were carved from the earth.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.153
Our ancestors dreamt of a new beginning,

09:13.360 --> 09:17.273
a colony where human and Hath
work and live together.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.354
What happened?

09:19.440 --> 09:23.115
The dream died,
broken along with Hath promises.

09:23.200 --> 09:25.191
They wanted it all for themselves.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.316
But those early pioneers,
they fought back.

09:27.400 --> 09:31.109
They used the machines to produce
soldiers instead of colonists

09:31.200 --> 09:33.509
and began this battle for survival.

09:33.600 --> 09:36.592
There's nothing but earth outside.
Why is that?

09:36.680 --> 09:39.592
- Why build everything underground?
- The surface is too dangerous.

09:39.680 --> 09:42.114
Well, then why build windows
in the first place?

09:42.240 --> 09:46.153
- And what's this mean?
- The rites and symbols of our ancestors.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.754
The meanings lost in time.

09:48.840 --> 09:52.071
- How long has this war gone on for?
- Longer than anyone can remember.

09:52.160 --> 09:55.675
Countless generations
marked only by the dead.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.832
- What, fighting all this time?
- Because we must.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.151
Every child of the machine
is born with this knowledge.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.953
It's our inheritance. It's all we know.

10:05.360 --> 10:08.033
How to fight and how to die.

10:20.920 --> 10:24.959
Right. So we're here?

10:29.880 --> 10:32.189
Does this show the entire city,
including the Hath side?

10:32.280 --> 10:33.554
Yes. Why?

10:34.240 --> 10:38.119
- Well, it'll help us find Martha.
- We've more important things to do.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.112
The progenation machines are powered
down for the night shift,

10:41.200 --> 10:43.953
but, as soon as they're active, we could
breed a whole platoon from you two.

10:44.040 --> 10:46.759
I'm not having sons and daughters
by some great big flipping machine.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.037
Sorry, no offence, but you're not...
Well, I mean, you're not real.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.315
You're no better than him.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.392
I have a body, I have a mind,
I have independent thought.

10:55.480 --> 10:58.438
How am I not real?
What makes you better than me?

10:58.520 --> 11:01.193
Well said, soldier.
We need more like you

11:01.280 --> 11:02.872
if ever we're to find the source.

11:02.960 --> 11:05.758
Ooh, the source. What's that then?
What's the source?

11:05.840 --> 11:09.150
- I like a source. What is it?
- The breath of life.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.434
And that would be?

11:10.520 --> 11:13.796
In the beginning, the Great One
breathed life into the universe.

11:13.880 --> 11:17.031
And then she looked at what she'd done
and she sighed.

11:17.120 --> 11:20.237
- "She," I like that.
- Right, so it's a creation myth.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.311
It's not myth, it's real.

11:22.880 --> 11:28.273
That sigh, from the beginning of time,
it was caught and kept as the source.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.716
It was lost when the war started,
but it's here somewhere.

11:31.800 --> 11:34.519
Whoever holds the source
controls the destiny of this planet.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.910
Ah! I thought so.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.917
There's a suppressed layer
of information in this map.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.592
If I can just...

11:43.680 --> 11:45.318
What is it? What does it mean?

11:45.400 --> 11:48.597
See? A whole complex of tunnels
hidden from sight.

11:50.320 --> 11:51.799
Hold on. Look!

11:53.280 --> 11:56.716
That must be the lost temple.
The source will be inside.

11:56.800 --> 12:00.634
You've shown us the way.
And look, we're closer than the Hath.

12:00.720 --> 12:01.789
It's ours.

12:01.880 --> 12:05.236
That's a new map.
There's a different set of tunnels.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.711
Tell them to prepare to move out.

12:08.800 --> 12:12.156
We'll progenate new soldiers
on the morning shift, then we march.

12:12.240 --> 12:15.676
Once we've reached the temple,
peace will be restored at long last.

12:15.760 --> 12:17.910
Call me old-fashioned,
but if you really wanted peace,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.276
- couldn't you just stop fighting?
- Only when we have the source.

12:21.360 --> 12:24.397
It will give us the power
to erase every stinking Hath

12:24.480 --> 12:25.595
off the face of this planet.

12:25.680 --> 12:27.875
Hang on, hang on.
A second ago, it was peace in our time,

12:27.960 --> 12:30.997
- now you're talking about genocide.
- For us, that means the same thing.

12:31.080 --> 12:32.798
Then you need to get yourself
a better dictionary.

12:32.880 --> 12:34.438
When you do, look up genocide.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.795
You'll see a little picture of me there
and the caption will read,

12:36.880 --> 12:38.632
"Over my dead body!"

12:39.360 --> 12:41.749
You're the one who showed us
the path to victory,

12:41.840 --> 12:45.071
but you can consider the irony
from your prison cell.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.798
Cline, at arms.

12:46.880 --> 12:49.314
Oi, oi, oi. All right.
Cool the beans, Rambo.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.391
Take them.
I won't have them spreading treason.

12:51.480 --> 12:54.836
And if you try anything, Doctor,
I'll see that your woman dies first.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.672
- We're not a couple.
- I'm not his woman.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.875
Come on, this way.

12:57.960 --> 12:59.871
I'm gonna stop you, Cobb.
You need to know that.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.997
I have an army and the breath
of God on my side, Doctor.

13:03.080 --> 13:04.877
- What'll you have?
- This.

13:04.960 --> 13:08.509
- Lock 'em up and guard 'em.
- What about the new soldier?

13:08.680 --> 13:11.638
We can't trust her. She's from
pacifist stock. Take them all.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.791
But I didn't do anything.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.517
I think I just started a war.

13:33.880 --> 13:37.270
More numbers.
They've got to mean something.

13:37.360 --> 13:40.193
Makes as much sense as
the breath of life story.

13:40.280 --> 13:44.717
- You mean that's not true?
- No. It's a myth, isn't it, Doctor?

13:45.200 --> 13:48.078
Yes, but there could still
be something real in that temple.

13:48.160 --> 13:51.516
Something that's become a myth,
a piece of technology, a weapon.

13:51.600 --> 13:53.033
So the source could be a weapon

13:53.120 --> 13:55.873
and we've just given directions
to Captain Nutjob?

13:55.960 --> 13:57.916
- Oh, yes.
- Not good, is it?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.353
That's why we need to get out of here,

13:59.440 --> 14:02.796
find Martha and stop Cobb
from slaughtering the Hath.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.156
What are you staring at?

14:06.240 --> 14:08.390
You keep insisting you're not a soldier,

14:08.480 --> 14:12.029
but look at you, drawing up strategies
like a proper general.

14:12.120 --> 14:14.315
No, no. I'm trying to stop the fighting.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.790
- Isn't every soldier?
- Well, I suppose, but that's...

14:18.600 --> 14:21.398
That's... Technically.
I haven't got time for this.

14:21.480 --> 14:22.913
Donna, give me your phone.
Time for an upgrade.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.831
- And now you've got a weapon.
- It's not a weapon.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.354
But you're using it to fight back.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.429
I'm gonna learn so much from you.
You are such a soldier.

14:31.920 --> 14:35.151
- Donna, will you tell her?
- Ooh, you are speechless.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.992
I'm loving this. You keep on, Jenny.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.073
- Doctor?
- Martha, you're alive!

14:42.160 --> 14:44.469
Doctor! Oh, am I glad
to hear your voice.

14:44.560 --> 14:45.788
- Are you all right?
- I'm with Donna. We're fine.

14:45.880 --> 14:48.872
- What about you?
- And... And Jenny. She's fine, too.

14:48.960 --> 14:50.678
Yes, all right. And... And...

14:50.760 --> 14:54.196
Jenny. That's the woman
from the machine, the soldier.

14:55.280 --> 14:57.350
My daughter. Except she isn't, she's...

14:57.440 --> 14:59.715
- Anyway, where are you?
- I'm in the Hath camp.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.918
I'm okay, but something's going on.
The Hath are all marching off

15:04.000 --> 15:07.117
to some place that's
appeared on this map thing.

15:07.200 --> 15:09.350
Oh. That was me.

15:10.200 --> 15:12.634
If both armies are heading that way,
there's gonna be a bloodbath.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.153
- What do you want me to do?
- Just stay where you are.

15:14.240 --> 15:15.593
If you're safe there,
don't move, do you hear?

15:15.680 --> 15:16.669
But I can help.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.354
Doctor? Doctor?

15:21.840 --> 15:24.593
The doors that have been closed
will be open to us now.

15:24.680 --> 15:28.639
The door to the temple,
to the source and to victory.

15:34.160 --> 15:37.197
Come the dawn cycle, we march!

15:37.920 --> 15:40.070
To war with the Hath!

15:42.760 --> 15:44.876
They're getting ready to move out.
We have to get past that guard.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.359
- I can deal with him.
- No, no, no, no.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.793
- You're not going anywhere.
- What?

15:47.880 --> 15:51.190
- You belong here with them.
- She belongs with us.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.236
With you. She's your daughter.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.356
She's a soldier.
She came out of that machine.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.353
Oh, yes. I know that bit.
Listen, have you got that stethoscope?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.629
Give it to me. Come on.

16:06.800 --> 16:09.314
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

16:09.560 --> 16:11.152
Just hold still.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.359
Come here.

16:20.680 --> 16:24.150
Listen, and then tell me
where she belongs.

16:46.320 --> 16:47.639
Two hearts.

16:47.720 --> 16:49.438
Exactly.
- What's going on?

16:49.520 --> 16:54.036
Does that mean she's a...
What do you call a female Time Lord?

16:54.120 --> 16:56.953
- What's a Time Lord?
- It's who I am. It's where I'm from.

16:57.040 --> 16:58.155
And I'm from you?

16:58.240 --> 17:01.755
You're an echo, that's all.
A Time Lord is so much more.

17:02.600 --> 17:06.718
A sum of knowledge, a code,
a shared history, a shared suffering.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.435
And it's gone now, all of it.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.032
Gone forever.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.358
What happened?

17:20.599 --> 17:23.592
- There was a war.
- Like this one?

17:26.760 --> 17:28.512
Bigger. Much bigger.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.713
And you fought?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.113
And killed?

17:36.080 --> 17:37.149
Yes.

17:39.080 --> 17:41.116
Then how are we different?

17:45.760 --> 17:49.275
I need to charge it up. I need power.
Do you understand?

17:52.040 --> 17:56.477
There's even more.
In 3D! Oh, you're a clever Hath!

17:57.360 --> 17:58.998
So this is where everybody's headed?

18:00.320 --> 18:02.754
But look, those tunnels sort of zig-zag.

18:02.840 --> 18:06.549
If I went up and over the surface
in a straight line, I'd get there first.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.234
Why not?

18:09.760 --> 18:14.356
Are these the readings for the surface?
But it doesn't look too bad.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.749
Nitrogen and oxygen about 80-20.

18:16.840 --> 18:21.311
That's fine. Ozone levels are high
and some big radiation spikes.

18:21.440 --> 18:24.318
But as long as
I'm not out there too long...

18:24.680 --> 18:26.716
I have to find my friends.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.593
Come on, then.

18:36.720 --> 18:37.789
Hey.

18:39.400 --> 18:40.958
I'm not supposed to talk to you.
I'm on duty.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.315
Yeah, I know. Guarding me.

18:43.920 --> 18:48.038
So does that mean I'm dangerous

18:48.440 --> 18:50.476
or that I need protecting?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.788
- Protecting from what?
- Ooh, I don't know. Men like you.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.195
Keep quiet and open the door.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.035
I'd like to see you try that.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.349
That's the way out.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.591
Don't you dare.

19:23.440 --> 19:25.431
Let me distract this one.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.872
I have picked up a few
womanly wiles over the years.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.634
Let's save your wiles for later,

19:35.800 --> 19:37.597
in case of emergency.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.795
I was gonna distract him,
not clobber him.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.189
Well, it worked, didn't it?

20:03.640 --> 20:07.349
I still have a copy of that new map.
Just stay there. Don't hurt anyone.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.788
You can stay down here and
live your whole life in the shadows

20:36.880 --> 20:39.155
or come with me and
stand in the open air,

20:39.240 --> 20:41.515
feel the wind on your face.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.398
What's it gonna be?

20:44.760 --> 20:47.638
It's up to you,
but nothing's gonna stop me.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.715
I knew you couldn't resist it.

21:26.600 --> 21:27.874
Er, language!

21:29.240 --> 21:30.468
Come on.

21:38.920 --> 21:42.549
It was the girl. She tricked me.
They... They got away. I'm sorry.

21:42.640 --> 21:45.518
I've waited all my life for this moment.

21:45.600 --> 21:49.752
No one's gonna get in my way,
certainly not this Doctor.

21:50.520 --> 21:53.193
Alarm! We march!

21:53.320 --> 21:54.958
To war!

21:55.520 --> 21:56.635
Wait!

21:57.720 --> 22:00.518
This is it. The hidden tunnel.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.752
There must be a control panel.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.991
There's another one of those numbers.
They're everywhere.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.593
The original builders
must have left them.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.671
An old cataloguing system.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.910
You got a pen, a bit of paper?

22:12.640 --> 22:15.154
'Cause, do you see?
The numbers are counting down.

22:15.240 --> 22:19.358
This one ends in 1-4.
The prison cell said 1-6.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.908
Always thinking, both of you.
Who are you people?

22:22.000 --> 22:24.673
- I told you, I'm the Doctor.
- The Doctor, that's it?

22:24.760 --> 22:28.070
- That's all he ever says.
- So you don't have a name either?

22:28.160 --> 22:30.594
- Are you an anomaly, too?
- No.

22:31.160 --> 22:33.879
Oh, come off it. You're the most
anomalous bloke I've ever known.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.154
Here it is!

22:35.240 --> 22:37.674
And Time Lords,
what are they for exactly?

22:37.760 --> 22:40.638
For? They're not...
They're not for anything.

22:40.720 --> 22:45.111
- So what do you do?
- I travel through time and space.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.112
He saves planets, rescues civilisations

22:48.200 --> 22:51.397
defeats terrible creatures
and runs a lot.

22:51.600 --> 22:55.036
Seriously, there's an outrageous amount
of running involved.

22:55.120 --> 22:56.519
Great!

22:57.000 --> 22:58.638
Support 5, with me.

22:58.720 --> 23:01.632
No. What were you saying about running?

23:14.520 --> 23:16.829
That's not mood lighting, is it?

23:22.000 --> 23:25.037
- No. I didn't think so.
- Arming device.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.718
There's more of these.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.519
Always eight numbers,
counting down the closer we get.

23:34.720 --> 23:35.789
Here we go.

23:35.880 --> 23:38.678
You'd better be quick.
The general.

23:39.600 --> 23:41.397
- Where are you going?
- I can hold them up.

23:41.480 --> 23:44.199
- No. We don't need any more dead.
- But it's them or us.

23:44.280 --> 23:47.033
- It doesn't mean you have to kill them.
- I'm trying to save your life.

23:47.120 --> 23:49.395
Listen to me, the killing,

23:50.880 --> 23:54.759
after a while it infects you
and once it does you're never rid of it.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.116
- But we don't have a choice.
- We always have a choice.

23:58.200 --> 24:00.236
- I'm sorry.
- Jenny!

24:01.640 --> 24:03.596
This door, now!

24:05.600 --> 24:08.797
Right, there she is! Come on!

24:14.920 --> 24:18.833
- Told you. Nothing but a soldier.
- She's trying to help.

24:23.320 --> 24:25.356
You must increase your fire!

24:27.520 --> 24:30.717
Jenny, come on!
- I'm coming.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.111
Cease-fire! Cease-fire.

24:35.560 --> 24:38.199
- That's it.
- Jenny, leave it. Let's go!

24:38.960 --> 24:42.748
You're a child of the machine.
You're on my side.

24:42.840 --> 24:47.038
Join us.
Join us in the war against the Hath.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.873
It's in your blood, girl. Don't deny it.

25:00.400 --> 25:01.913
Jenny, come on!

25:02.600 --> 25:04.591
- That's it!
- Hurry up!

25:05.480 --> 25:08.119
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The circuits moved back.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.555
- Zap it back again!
- The controls are back there.

25:10.640 --> 25:11.675
They're coming!

25:11.760 --> 25:13.193
Wait! Just...

25:14.040 --> 25:15.837
There isn't... Jenny, I can't...

25:15.920 --> 25:18.275
I'll have to manage on my own.

25:21.040 --> 25:23.110
Watch and learn, Father.

25:28.960 --> 25:31.076
No way.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.679
- But that was impossible.
- Not impossible. Just a bit unlikely.

25:37.760 --> 25:41.150
Brilliant. You were brilliant!
Brilliant!

25:41.240 --> 25:44.073
I didn't kill him. General Cobb.
I could've killed him, but I didn't.

25:44.160 --> 25:46.037
You were right. I had a choice.

25:50.360 --> 25:51.952
I warned you, Cobb.

25:52.040 --> 25:54.474
If the source is a weapon,
I'm gonna make sure you never use it.

25:54.560 --> 25:57.154
One of us is gonna die today
and it won't be me.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.589
It can't be much further.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.433
Help me!

26:32.320 --> 26:34.993
I'm sinking! I'm sinking! Help me peg!

26:35.360 --> 26:37.715
Help me! Help me! Help me peg!

26:38.080 --> 26:39.957
Help! I'm sinking!

27:04.200 --> 27:05.235
No!

27:10.200 --> 27:11.872
No!

27:36.960 --> 27:40.635
So you travel together,
but you're not together.

27:40.720 --> 27:45.669
What? No, no, no way.
No, no. We're friends, that's all.

27:46.360 --> 27:50.353
I mean, we're not even the same species.
There's probably laws against it.

27:50.440 --> 27:53.750
- And what's it like, the travelling?
- Oh, never a dull moment.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.274
It can be terrifying,

27:56.360 --> 27:58.954
brilliant and funny,
sometimes all at the same time.

27:59.040 --> 28:02.919
I've seen some amazing things though.
A whole new world.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.392
- Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.
- You will.

28:07.280 --> 28:09.236
- Won't she, Doctor?
- Hmm?

28:09.480 --> 28:12.313
Do you think Jenny
will see any new worlds?

28:13.320 --> 28:14.753
I suppose so.

28:16.160 --> 28:19.232
You mean...
You mean you'll take me with you?

28:19.320 --> 28:20.469
Well, we can't leave you here, can we?

28:20.560 --> 28:23.438
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!

28:23.520 --> 28:27.115
- Come on. Let's get a move on.
- Careful, there might be traps.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.668
Kids, they never listen.

28:35.040 --> 28:38.271
Oh, I know that look.
See it a lot round our way.

28:38.360 --> 28:42.478
Blokes with pushchairs and frowns.
You've got dad shock.

28:42.560 --> 28:45.154
- Dad shock?
- Sudden, unexpected fatherhood.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.515
- It'll take a bit of getting used to.
- No. It's not that.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.115
Well, what is it then?
Having Jenny in the Tardis, is that it?

28:51.200 --> 28:53.236
What's she gonna do? Cramp your style?

28:53.320 --> 28:57.472
Like, you've got a sports car, she's
gonna turn it into a people carrier?

28:57.560 --> 28:58.993
Donna, I've been a father before.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.833
- What?
- I lost all that a long time ago,

29:02.360 --> 29:06.638
- along with everything else.
- I'm sorry. I didn't know.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.030
Why didn't you tell me?

29:11.800 --> 29:14.712
You talk all the time,
but you don't say anything.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.392
I know. Just...

29:19.320 --> 29:21.993
When I look at her now, I can see them,

29:23.640 --> 29:26.757
the hole they left,
all the pain that filled it.

29:29.240 --> 29:32.232
Just don't know
if I can face that every day.

29:32.360 --> 29:37.070
It won't stay like that.
She'll help you. We both will.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.957
When they died,
that part of me died with them.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.715
It'll never come back, not now.

29:46.080 --> 29:51.313
I'll tell you something, Doctor,
something I've never told you before.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.039
I think you're wrong.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.150
They've blasted through the beams.
Time to run again.

30:00.240 --> 30:03.437
- Love the running. Yeah?
- Love the running.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.039
We're trapped.
- Can't be.

30:30.120 --> 30:33.954
This must be the temple. This is a door.

30:35.520 --> 30:38.830
And again. We're down to 1-2 now.

30:38.920 --> 30:40.433
- I got it!
- I can hear them.

30:40.520 --> 30:42.590
- Nearly done!
- This can't be a cataloguing system.

30:42.680 --> 30:43.715
They're getting closer.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.438
- Then get back here.
- They're too similar.

30:45.520 --> 30:46.555
Not yet.
- Too familiar.

30:46.640 --> 30:47.709
Now!

30:48.840 --> 30:50.034
Got it!

30:57.440 --> 30:58.953
They're coming.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.191
Close the door.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.994
- That was close.
- No fun otherwise.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.515
It's not what I'd call a temple.

31:13.600 --> 31:16.751
- It looks more like...
- Fusion-drive transport.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.311
- It's a spaceship.
- What, the original one?

31:20.400 --> 31:21.833
The one the first colonists arrived on?

31:21.920 --> 31:25.515
Well, it could be, but the power cells
would have run down after all that time.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.919
This one's still powered up
and functioning.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.228
Come on!

31:36.080 --> 31:38.753
It's the Hath.
That door's not gonna last much longer.

31:38.840 --> 31:41.559
And if General Cobb gets through
down there, war's gonna break out.

31:41.640 --> 31:43.551
Look, look, look, look!

31:43.760 --> 31:45.637
Ship's log.

31:45.720 --> 31:48.393
First wave of human-Hath
co-colonisation of Planet Messaline.

31:48.480 --> 31:49.595
So it is the original ship?

31:49.680 --> 31:51.910
- What happened?
- There's one construction.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.434
They used robot drones
to build the city.

31:54.520 --> 31:57.876
- But does it mention the war?
Final entry,

31:57.960 --> 31:59.632
"Mission commander dead.

31:59.720 --> 32:01.472
"Still no agreement on who
should assume leadership.

32:01.560 --> 32:03.471
"Hath and humans
have divided into factions. "

32:03.560 --> 32:06.120
That must be it. A power vacuum.

32:06.200 --> 32:08.475
The crew divided into two factions,
then turned on each other.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.755
Start using the progenation machines,
suddenly you've got two armies

32:10.840 --> 32:11.955
fighting a never-ending war.

32:12.040 --> 32:13.917
Two armies who are now both outside.

32:14.000 --> 32:15.433
Look at that!

32:16.280 --> 32:19.750
- It's like the numbers in the tunnels.
- No, no, no, but listen.

32:19.840 --> 32:22.115
I spent six months working as a temp
in Hounslow Library

32:22.200 --> 32:24.953
and I mastered the Dewey Decimal
System in two days flat.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.635
I'm good with numbers.
It's staring us in the face.

32:28.720 --> 32:29.948
What is?

32:31.000 --> 32:32.479
It's the date.

32:34.200 --> 32:36.555
Assuming the first two numbers
are some big old space date,

32:36.640 --> 32:38.596
then you've got year, month, day.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.113
It's the other way round,
like it is in America.

32:40.200 --> 32:42.714
Oh, it's the new Byzantine calendar!

32:43.280 --> 32:46.397
The codes are completion dates
for each section.

32:46.840 --> 32:49.308
They finish it, they stamp the date on.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.675
So the numbers aren't counting down.

32:51.760 --> 32:56.072
They're going out from here day by day
as the city got built.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.594
Yes. Oh, good work, Donna!

32:58.680 --> 33:01.035
Yeah, but you're still not getting it.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.715
The first number I saw back there
was 60-12-07-17.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.948
- Well, look at the date today.
-0-7-24... No.

33:10.320 --> 33:12.595
- What does it mean?
- Seven days.

33:12.680 --> 33:13.954
That's it!

33:14.040 --> 33:16.076
- Seven days.
- Seven days.

33:16.160 --> 33:19.038
- What do you mean, "seven days"?
- Seven days since war broke out.

33:19.120 --> 33:23.033
This war started seven days ago.
Just a week. A week.

33:23.120 --> 33:26.829
- They said years.
- No. They said generations.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.559
And if they're all like you and
they're products of those machines...

33:29.640 --> 33:31.312
They could have 20 generations in a day.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.516
Each generation gets killed in the war,
passes on the legend.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.431
Oh, Donna, you're a genius!

33:35.520 --> 33:37.670
But all the buildings, the encampments,
they're in ruins.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.719
They're not ruined, they're just empty,
waiting to be populated.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.912
Oh, they've mythologised
their entire history.

33:45.000 --> 33:48.037
The source must be part of that, too.
Come on!

33:51.600 --> 33:53.750
- Doctor!
- Martha!

33:53.840 --> 33:56.115
Oh, I should've known you wouldn't stay
away from all the excitement.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.794
- Donna!
- Ooh, you're filthy. What happened?

33:58.880 --> 34:00.836
I took the surface route.

34:02.160 --> 34:03.309
That's the General.
We haven't got much time.

34:03.400 --> 34:05.038
We don't even know
what we're looking for.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.873
- Is it me or can you smell flowers?
- Yes.

34:08.520 --> 34:09.998
Bougainvillea.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.031
I say we follow our nose.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.108
Oh, yes!

34:30.080 --> 34:31.433
Yes!

34:34.639 --> 34:36.437
Isn't this brilliant?

34:37.600 --> 34:39.318
Is that the source?

34:40.239 --> 34:41.753
It's beautiful.

34:42.120 --> 34:44.429
- What is it?
- Terraforming.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.797
It's a third-generation
terraforming device.

34:47.880 --> 34:51.235
- So why are we suddenly in Kew Gardens?
- 'Cause that's what it does.

34:51.320 --> 34:54.072
All this, only bigger, much bigger.
It's in a transit state.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.310
Producing all this must help
keep it stable before they find...

35:00.760 --> 35:04.150
Stop! Hold your fire!

35:04.600 --> 35:07.831
- What is this, some kind of trap?
- You said you wanted this war over.

35:07.920 --> 35:11.469
- I want this war won!
- You can't win. No one can.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.033
You don't even know why you're here.

35:13.120 --> 35:15.918
Your whole history,
it's just Chinese whispers,

35:16.000 --> 35:18.958
getting more distorted
the more it's passed on.

35:19.760 --> 35:22.274
This is the source.

35:23.360 --> 35:24.679
This is what you're fighting over,

35:24.760 --> 35:27.672
a device to rejuvenate
a planet's ecosystem.

35:27.760 --> 35:28.954
It's nothing mystical.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.793
It's from a laboratory,
not some creator.

35:32.240 --> 35:34.151
It's a bubble of gases,

35:34.880 --> 35:38.190
a cocktail of stuff
for accelerated evolution.

35:38.280 --> 35:41.397
Methane, hydrogen, ammonia,
amino acids, proteins, nucleic acids.

35:41.480 --> 35:44.313
It's used to make
barren planets habitable.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.632
Look around you.

35:48.320 --> 35:51.073
It's not for killing.
It's for bringing life.

35:52.560 --> 35:56.997
If you allow it, it can lift you out
of these dark tunnels

35:57.440 --> 36:00.910
and into the bright, bright sunlight.

36:02.440 --> 36:05.079
No more fighting, no more killing.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.876
I'm the Doctor
and I declare this war is over.

36:52.280 --> 36:53.474
What's happening?

36:53.560 --> 36:57.235
The gases will escape and trigger
the terraforming process.

36:57.480 --> 37:00.358
- What does that mean?
- It means a new world.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.119
No!

37:06.160 --> 37:09.709
Jenny. Jenny. Talk to me, Jenny.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.236
Is she gonna be all right?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.479
A new world.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.513
It's beautiful.

37:34.800 --> 37:38.475
Jenny, please hold on.
You need to hold on, do you hear me?

37:39.600 --> 37:42.876
We've got things to do,
you and me, eh? Eh?

37:45.480 --> 37:47.198
We can go anywhere.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.755
Everywhere. You choose.

37:51.720 --> 37:53.358
That sounds good.

37:55.920 --> 37:59.913
You're my daughter
and we've only just got started.

38:02.440 --> 38:04.271
You're gonna be great.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.309
You're gonna be more than great.

38:08.800 --> 38:11.837
You're gonna be amazing.
Do you hear me, Jenny?

38:36.040 --> 38:37.712
Two hearts.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.751
Two hearts, just like me.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.990
If we wait, we just wait...

38:45.120 --> 38:47.076
There's no sign, Doctor.

38:47.520 --> 38:51.718
There's no regeneration.
She's like you, but maybe not enough.

38:52.520 --> 38:55.159
No. Too much.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.631
That's the truth of it.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.471
She was too much like me.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.599
I never would.

39:46.600 --> 39:48.272
Have you got that?

39:49.120 --> 39:50.917
I never would.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.350
When you start this new world,

39:59.800 --> 40:01.995
this world of human and Hath,

40:03.920 --> 40:05.399
remember that!

40:07.480 --> 40:10.358
Make the foundation of this society

40:12.160 --> 40:13.991
a man who never would!

40:44.040 --> 40:47.316
It's happening. The terraforming.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.590
Build a city nice and safe underground,

40:51.680 --> 40:54.911
strip away the top soil and there it is.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.958
- And what about Jenny?
- Let us give her a proper ceremony.

41:02.080 --> 41:05.356
I think it would help us. Please.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.036
Jenny was the reason
for the Tardis bringing us here.

41:16.120 --> 41:18.156
It just got here too soon,

41:18.920 --> 41:21.798
which then created
Jenny in the first place.

41:23.720 --> 41:27.599
Paradox. An endless paradox.

41:31.760 --> 41:35.070
- Time to go home.
- Yeah. Home.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.471
- Are you sure about this?
- Yeah. Positive.

42:00.120 --> 42:03.999
I can't do this any more.
You'll be the same one day.

42:04.080 --> 42:06.310
Not me, never.

42:06.480 --> 42:10.314
How could I ever go back to
normal life after seeing all this?

42:11.360 --> 42:14.033
I'm gonna travel with that man forever.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.592
- Good luck.
- And you.

42:26.200 --> 42:30.478
- We're making a habit of this.
- Yeah, and you'd think it'd get easier.

42:31.640 --> 42:34.313
All those things you've
been ready to die for.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.038
I thought for a moment there

42:36.120 --> 42:38.190
you'd finally found
something worth living for.

42:38.280 --> 42:41.716
Oh, there's always something
worth living for, Martha.

42:52.400 --> 42:56.313
- Bye, Doctor.
- Goodbye, Dr Jones.

43:35.280 --> 43:36.872
Hello, boys.

43:42.080 --> 43:43.672
The shuttle.

43:45.040 --> 43:46.996
Jenny, what are you doing? Come back.

43:47.080 --> 43:50.993
Sorry, can't stop.
What are you gonna do? Tell my dad?

43:51.080 --> 43:54.550
- But where are you going?
- I've got the whole universe.

43:55.120 --> 43:57.998
Planets to save,
civilisations to rescue,

43:58.360 --> 44:00.510
creatures to defeat

44:02.520 --> 44:04.954
and an awful lot of running to do.

44:10.120 --> 44:11.872
- Agatha Christie.
- What about her?

44:11.960 --> 44:13.678
- That's me.
- No!

44:14.600 --> 44:15.350
Murder!

44:15.440 --> 44:16.998
Chief Inspector Smith
from Scotland Yard,

44:17.080 --> 44:19.878
known as the Doctor. Miss Noble is
the plucky young girl that helps me out.

44:19.960 --> 44:21.188
I say.

44:21.600 --> 44:24.717
There's a murder, a mystery
and Agatha Christie.

44:25.160 --> 44:27.469
So? Happens to me all the time.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.312
Show yourself, demon.

44:29.400 --> 44:30.515
No!

44:30.600 --> 44:31.669
There's nowhere to run.

44:32.160 --> 44:34.435
The thrill is in the chase,
never in the capture.

44:34.520 --> 44:35.635
Oh, my God.

44:35.720 --> 44:38.632
If anyone can solve this, it's you.
