WHAT DID I MISS?

00:09.217 --> 00:12.095
- OH, WE WERE JUST TELLING
SAD, BLOATED MELANIE

00:12.178 --> 00:13.596
THAT ALEC WAS RIGHT
TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.099
- WHAT?
THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO SAY!

00:16.181 --> 00:17.267
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE HER CRY.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.145
- THAT'S THE PLAN.

00:20.228 --> 00:23.273
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CRY
SINCE ALEC AND I BROKE UP,

00:23.356 --> 00:26.276
AND I FEEL LIKE IT'S
ALL BOTTLED UP INSIDE ME.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.987

00:48.173 --> 00:50.592

- AFTER ALL THE ARTSY-FARTSY
CINEMA ELKA AND I HAVE HAD

00:53.261 --> 00:55.180
TO SIT THROUGH
IN OUR THEORY OF FILM CLASS,

00:55.263 --> 00:57.640
WE COULD USE
A LITTLE MINDLESS ENTERTAINMENT.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.809
NO SUBTITLES,
NO MORAL AMBIGUITY,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.436
NO CHESS GAMES WITH DEATH.

01:01.519 --> 01:06.316
- AND ONLY GOOD-LOOKING PEOPLE
GET NAKED.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.318
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU GUYS?
I'M REALLY NOT UP FOR A MOVIE.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.320
YOU GO, I'M GONNA STAY HERE
AND FINISH MY WINE.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.155
I'LL PAY THE CHECK.
- OH, HONEY, ARE YOU SURE?

01:12.238 --> 01:14.157
- NO, DON'T TRY TO BE NICE.
IT ONLY MAKES IT HARDER.

01:14.240 --> 01:18.453
- WELL, BYE, MEL.
SORRY YOU'RE SO HIDEOUS.

01:18.536 --> 01:20.663

01:23.625 --> 01:25.794
- [gasps] NOTHING.

01:43.478 --> 01:45.814
- BOURBON AND BRANCH.

[crying] THERE'S NO NUT
IN MY PEANUT.

02:01.412 --> 02:05.083
- THAT'S A BUMMER,
BUT EASILY REMEDIED.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.543
- OH, WHY BOTHER?

02:06.626 --> 02:09.586
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
THE DAMN PEANUT!

02:09.670 --> 02:11.923
[crying]
I JUST WANT ALEC.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.716
- HEY, DON'T CRY.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.593
- NO, NO, THIS IS REALLY GOOD.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.512
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEEN ABLE TO CRY

02:17.595 --> 02:19.681
SINCE I BROKE UP
WITH MY BOYFRIEND.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.766
- ALEC?
- OH, MY GOD, YOU KNOW HIM?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.894

NEVER MIND.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.022
LOOK, I'M HERE,
SO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.859

'CAUSE I NEVER WANT
TO BE WITH ANOTHER MAN.

OH, HEY, PEANUT.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.921
- [chuckles nervously]

02:52.005 --> 02:55.133
LISTEN, I'M REALLY EMBARRASSED,
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING

02:55.216 --> 02:56.968
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,
SO I NEED YOU

02:57.051 --> 03:01.973
TO ANSWER ONE VERY
IMPORTANT QUESTION.

03:02.056 --> 03:05.226
DID I EAT
ALL THESE CANDY BARS?

03:05.310 --> 03:07.770
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT WAS ME.

03:07.854 --> 03:09.647
- OH, THANK GOD.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.857
WE HAVE SEX?

03:10.940 --> 03:12.901
- NO.
I MEAN...

03:12.984 --> 03:15.778
NOTHING ACTIONABLE.

03:15.862 --> 03:17.447

03:17.530 --> 03:19.407
- LOOK, YOU WERE SAD
AND A LITTLE DRUNK,

03:19.490 --> 03:21.659
SO I DROVE YOU HOME
TO MAKE SURE YOU WERE SAFE.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.828
AND THEN I LAID YOU...

03:23.912 --> 03:27.123
DOWN ON THESE SHEETS,
AND THEY ARE SO SOFT.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.750
WHAT IS THE THREAD COUNT
ON THESE BABIES?

03:28.833 --> 03:32.295
- FORGET ABOUT THE SHEETS.
WHAT DID WE DO ON THE SHEETS?

03:32.378 --> 03:35.590
- DON'T WORRY,
WE DIDN'T EXCHANGE ANY FLUIDS.

03:35.673 --> 03:38.968
WELL, I SPILLED A LITTLE SPRITE
ON YOU, BUT--

03:39.052 --> 03:41.095
MOSTLY WE JUST CUDDLED.

03:42.430 --> 03:47.477
IT WAS SO NICE.
[whispering] YOU'RE NICE.

I OPERATE COMPLETELY WITHIN
THE BOUNDS OF THE LAW.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.249
- I'M NOT WEARING A WIRE.

05:33.332 --> 05:36.502
- GOOD, LET'S BRIBE SOME JUDGES.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.087

WE SHOULD SHAKE HANDS,

05:56.189 --> 05:59.275
SINCE WE'RE MEETING

06:01.736 --> 06:03.529
- DON'T MIND HER.
SHE'S GOING THROUGH A BREAKUP.

06:03.613 --> 06:07.784
- YES, POOR, OLD,
WRINKLED MELANIE.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.411
- OKAY, GUYS, YOU CAN STOP.
I CRIED LAST NIGHT...

06:10.495 --> 06:13.623
AND A LITTLE BIT
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

- WELL, I'LL JUST GO GET
THOSE NON-SEQUENTIAL HUNDREDS

06:16.501 --> 06:20.004
THAT I SO AWKWARDLY GOT
FROM THE BANK YESTERDAY.

I'M A STUDENT.

LAST NIGHT WAS LAST NIGHT.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.981
- WOMEN NEVER SAY NO TO ME.

06:39.065 --> 06:43.152
- REALLY?
- I DATE PROSTITUTES.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.988
SO IF THEY DID, THEY REALLY
WOULDN'T BE DOING THEIR JOB.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.448
- YOU DATE PROSTITUTES?

06:47.532 --> 06:48.658
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,

06:48.741 --> 06:49.826
WHEN I SAW YOU AT THE BAR
I ASSUMED THAT--

06:49.909 --> 06:52.662
- YOU THOUGHT I WAS
A PROSTITUTE?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.163
- WELL, YOU WERE MAKING
A MEAL OF THOSE PEANUTS

06:54.247 --> 06:55.665
AND DRINKING
OTHER PEOPLE'S WINE.

06:55.748 --> 06:59.168
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
UPPER MANAGEMENT.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.004
BUT NOW I THINK
YOU'RE SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.131
YOU'RE A REAL LADY.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.175
- I PASSED OUT DRUNK AND WOKE UP
WITH A TOTAL STRANGER.

07:06.259 --> 07:10.096
- THAT'S HOW MY MOM MET MY DAD.

07:10.179 --> 07:13.182
BY THE WAY, THEY CAN'T WAIT
TO MEET YOU.

07:13.266 --> 07:14.684
- YEAH...NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.687
GOOD LUCK WITH WHATEVER IT IS
YOU TWO ARE DOING.

07:17.770 --> 07:20.690
- OKAY, HERE'S YOUR MONEY.
GO AND DO YOUR MAGIC.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.400
- CHANGE OF PLANS.
I DON'T WANT THE MONEY.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.860
I WANT MELANIE.
- WHAT?

07:23.943 --> 07:25.528
- YOU HAVE TO GET HER
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.572
- OH, WELL, SHE'S NOT REALLY
DATING ANYONE RIGHT NOW.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.490
SHE'S SORT OF GOING THROUGH
A BAD BREAKUP.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.200
- MAKE IT HAPPEN,
OR OUR WHOLE DEAL'S OFF.

07:31.284 --> 07:35.830
- OKAY.
I'LL GO ASK HER.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.415
YOU KNOW,
I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE

07:37.498 --> 07:40.710
THAT I COULD GET JOY
TO GO OUT WITH YOU.

07:40.793 --> 07:45.423
- MELANIE.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.383
- WHERE'S MELANIE?

07:47.466 --> 07:50.344
- [slurred]
SHE WENT TO THE DOCTOR'S.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.891
- SHOOT.

07:54.974 --> 07:59.437
MELANIE, I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU,
ABOUT DANNY.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.647
YES, HE IS CUTE.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.904
GOOD NEWS!
IT'S A DATE.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.697
TONIGHT, HERE,
SHE'S GONNA COOK FOR YOU.

08:09.780 --> 08:11.407
- WHAT IS SHE MAKING?
- WHY?

08:11.490 --> 08:15.077
- 'CAUSE SOME FOODS
MAKE ME GASSY.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.954
- I'LL LET HER KNOW.
- OKAY.

08:19.457 --> 08:21.626
- I ONLY GIVE OUT
ONE "A" PER SEMESTER,

08:21.709 --> 08:23.044
AND THAT GOES
TO THE STUDENT FILM

08:23.127 --> 08:26.047
THAT NAUSEATES ME THE LEAST.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.216
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- SO, NOTHING CUTE,

08:28.299 --> 08:31.385
AND FOR GOD'S SAKES,
NOTHING WITH ANIMALS.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.931
- I HAVE NO IDEAS.

08:35.014 --> 08:37.725
- NO FLOWERS OPENING SLOWLY,
ALL RIGHT?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.769
I KNOW WHAT A VAGINA
LOOKS LIKE.

08:39.852 --> 08:42.938
IT LOOKS LIKE YEARS OF ALIMONY.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.024
- I'M OUT TOO.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.278
[knock at door]

08:49.362 --> 08:50.947
- DR. DUBIN IS STILL
IN DELIVERY.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.157
DO YOU WANT TO RESCHEDULE
OR SEE ONE OF THE OTHER DOCTORS?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.451
- OH, ANOTHER DOCTOR IS FINE.

08:55.534 --> 08:56.911
- SO JUST IN
FOR YOUR ANNUAL CHECKUP?

08:56.994 --> 08:57.912
- YES.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.997
ALTHOUGH I DID SLEEP
WITH SOMEONE LAST NIGHT,

09:00.081 --> 09:02.333
BUT HE SAID WE DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.585
ON THE OTHER HAND,
HE'S KIND OF SLEAZY,

09:04.669 --> 09:06.587
AND HE USUALLY SLEEPS
WITH PROSTITUTES...

09:06.671 --> 09:09.298
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK
WE DID ANYTHING.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.300
SO IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING
TO BE NOTED.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.468
OR NOT.

09:12.551 --> 09:15.596
ACTUALLY, DON'T PUT ANY
OF THAT DOWN.

09:15.680 --> 09:17.765
WHY ARE YOU WRITING?

09:17.848 --> 09:20.476
- JUST NOTES FOR THE DOCTOR.
NOW, LET'S GET YOUR WEIGHT.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.729
- UGH.
DO WE HAVE TO?

09:23.813 --> 09:26.482
BECAUSE I DRANK, LIKE,
A GALLON OF WINE LAST NIGHT.

09:26.565 --> 09:29.610
CAN'T YOU JUST PUT DOWN WHAT
I WAS LAST YEAR?

09:29.694 --> 09:31.445
WHY ARE YOU STILL WRITING?

09:35.574 --> 09:37.618
- OH, LET'S SEE.

09:41.706 --> 09:43.874
- JUST PUT THAT DOWN!

09:43.958 --> 09:46.168
- THE DOCTOR WILL BE RIGHT IN.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.972
- SHOOT.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.314
- MELANIE?

10:12.945 --> 10:15.948
- SO IN 1939,
GERMAN SS OFFICERS

10:16.032 --> 10:18.200
COMMANDEERED YOUR FAMILY'S HOME
IN KRAKOW.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.077
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN TERRIFIED.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.163
- YES.

10:22.246 --> 10:25.041
BUT I WAS ONE
OF THE LUCKY ONES.

10:25.124 --> 10:27.793
I SAID GOOD-BYE TO THE ANIMALS
ON THE FARM,

10:27.877 --> 10:31.630
AND FLED POLAND
THAT VERY NIGHT.

10:35.134 --> 10:38.262
- AND, CUT!

10:38.346 --> 10:40.389
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL, ELKA.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.434
MY FILM'S GOT EVERYTHING THOSE
OSCAR-WINNERS HAVE--

10:43.517 --> 10:48.105
CRAGGY-LOOKING OLD PEOPLE
TALKING ABOUT NAZIS.

10:48.189 --> 10:50.941
I'M A SHOO-IN TO GET THAT "A."

10:51.025 --> 10:52.360
- NOT SO FAST.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.570
I WANT TO INTERVIEW YOU
FOR MY FILM.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.988
- REALLY?

10:56.072 --> 10:57.573
BUT MY STORY
CAN'T POSSIBLY BE

10:57.656 --> 10:58.741
AS INTERESTING AS YOURS.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.744
- OH, DON'T PUT YOURSELF DOWN,
JOY.

11:01.827 --> 11:06.082
THAT'S MY JOB.

11:06.165 --> 11:08.542
[door closes]
- HEY, GUYS, GUESS WHAT.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.878
I HAVE A DATE
WITH MY GYNECOLOGIST.

11:10.961 --> 11:14.090
- THEY'RE CALLED APPOINTMENTS,
DEAR.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.760
- WE'VE ALL BEEN THERE,
MELANIE.

11:17.843 --> 11:20.054
SO DESPERATE FOR A MAN'S TOUCH

11:20.137 --> 11:23.265
YOU MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.519
- NO, I'VE NEVER DONE THAT.

11:26.602 --> 11:29.146
- NOR HAVE I.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.356
- NO, THIS IS A REAL DATE.

11:30.439 --> 11:32.775
REMEMBER THAT CUTE DOCTOR
I MET WHEN THE BAR GOT HELD UP,

11:32.858 --> 11:34.110
AND HE NEEDED ME
TO TAKE OFF MY SPANX

11:34.193 --> 11:35.444
SO HE COULD USE IT
AS A TOURNIQUET,

11:35.528 --> 11:36.946
AND I THOUGHT,
AT THE TIME,

11:37.029 --> 11:37.780
THAT'S THE MOST
EMBARRASSING WAY POSSIBLE

11:37.863 --> 11:38.989
TO MEET A GUY?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.909
WELL, SAME GUY,
MORE EMBARRASSING WAY.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.954
- YOU DIDN'T LET HIM
EXAMINE YOU.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.580
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
AND I KNOW I SAID

11:46.664 --> 11:48.624
I WASN'T GONNA START DATING YET,
BUT...

11:48.707 --> 11:50.251
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE THIS IS JUST WHAT I NEED

11:50.334 --> 11:53.087
TO GET OVER ALEC.
- YOU KNOW THE OLD SAYING.

11:53.170 --> 11:55.131
- WHEN GOD CLOSES A DOOR,
HE OPENS A WINDOW?

11:55.214 --> 11:56.173
- NO.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.467
THE BEST WAY TO GET OVER A MAN

11:58.551 --> 12:01.011
IS TO GET UNDER ANOTHER ONE.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.188
- WAIT, WAIT.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.315
WASN'T THIS THE GUY WHO SAID
HE'D CALL YOU AND NEVER DID?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.984
- YES, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE
HE GOT BACK TOGETHER

12:15.067 --> 12:16.277
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.820
AND THEN HE DIDN'T WANT
TO CALL JUST TO SAY

12:17.903 --> 12:19.488
HE WASN'T GONNA CALL,
BUT NOW THEY'VE BROKEN UP,

12:19.572 --> 12:22.575
SO WE CAN BE TWO MISERABLE PEAS
IN A POD TOGETHER.

12:22.658 --> 12:24.243
I'M EXCITED!

12:24.326 --> 12:26.120
- OH, THERE YOU ARE, MELANIE.
- GUESS WHAT.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.830
I HAVE A DATE TOMORROW NIGHT.
- PERFECT!

12:27.913 --> 12:31.459
SO WHAT YOU NEED
IS A PRACTICE DATE TONIGHT.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.501
- WHAT?

12:32.585 --> 12:36.338
- YES, I CAN GET YOU A DATE
WITH DANNY DOYLE.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.883
TONIGHT AT 8:00?
DONE AND DONE.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.885
- I'M NOT FOLLOWING.
- YEAH, I MET HIM LAST NIGHT

12:40.968 --> 12:42.636
AT THE BAR,
WE SPENT THE NIGHT TOGETHER,

12:42.720 --> 12:44.513
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING, AND NOW
HE THINKS HE'S IN LOVE WITH ME.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
- UP TO SPEED.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.186
- I CAN'T DATE HIM.
HE DATES PROSTITUTES.

12:50.269 --> 12:53.689
AND HE SPILLED SPRITE ON ME.
HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.525
- LOOK, I KNOW THIS IS A HUGE
THING, BUT IT'S JUST DINNER.

12:56.609 --> 12:57.985
AND I'LL MONITOR YOUR DRINKING

12:58.068 --> 13:00.821
SO THAT YOU DON'T END UP
IN BED WITH HIM AGAIN.

13:00.905 --> 13:01.864
OH, PLEASE?

13:01.947 --> 13:03.741
HE'S REFUSING TO HELP EMMET

13:03.824 --> 13:05.576
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

13:05.659 --> 13:08.704
- FINE, I'LL LET HIM
TAKE ME TO DINNER.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.373
- ACTUALLY, YOU'RE COOKING.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.710
AND I WOULD AVOID DAIRY
AND LEGUMES.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.254
- WHY?
- NOTHING.

13:22.176 --> 13:23.844
OKAY, DANNY WILL BE HERE
ANY MINUTE.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.096
GO PUT SOMETHING SEXIER ON.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.266
- NO, I'M DOING THIS
TO GET EMMET OFF, NOT DANNY.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.187
AND I'M BREAKING UP WITH HIM
TOMORROW AFTER THE ARRAIGNMENT,

13:33.270 --> 13:35.064
AND I'M GOING OUT WITH AARON
TOMORROW NIGHT.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.399
- ABSOLUTELY, BUT AT LEAST
GO PUT SOME LIPSTICK ON.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.611
- OKAY.
[doorbell rings]

13:42.821 --> 13:45.950
- I'M 90.
I'LL GET IT.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.578
- JUST TELL DANNY
I'LL BE DOWN IN A SEC.

13:49.662 --> 13:52.248
- HI, I'M DR. EVERETT.
IS MELANIE HOME?

13:52.331 --> 13:55.751
- OH, BOY.
UM, NO...

13:55.834 --> 13:57.711
I MEAN, NO, SHE'S NOT.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.755
- TELL HIM TO COME ON IN
AND OPEN THE WINE.

13:59.838 --> 14:04.134
- OH, I GUESS I WAS WRONG.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.096
COME IN, DR. EVERETT.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.389
- AARON?
- HI!

14:08.472 --> 14:12.393
- AARON--I--UH--AARON, HI.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.311
ELKA, THIS IS AARON.
- YES.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.397
I TOLD HIM YOU WEREN'T HERE,

14:16.480 --> 14:20.025
BUT THEN YOU OPENED YOUR
BIG MOUTH AND I WAS WRONG.

14:23.362 --> 14:25.614
- YOU LEFT YOUR WALLET
AT THE OFFICE,

14:25.698 --> 14:27.449
SO I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE CUTE

14:27.533 --> 14:28.951
IF I RETURNED IT,
LIKE I DID THE FIRST TIME.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.287
- OH.
AW, THAT IS CUTE.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.622
- I'M SORRY, I THOUGHT OUR DATE
WAS TOMORROW NIGHT.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.499
- OH, MY GOD,
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT!

14:35.583 --> 14:36.834
YOU'RE RIGHT,
IT IS TOMORROW NIGHT,

14:36.917 --> 14:39.753
SO I'LL JUST SEE YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.089
- I HEARD THE DOORBELL.
WHO ARE YOU?

14:42.172 --> 14:44.008
- IT'S AARON.
HE'S HERE FOR OUR DATE,

14:44.091 --> 14:45.801
WHICH IS TOMORROW NIGHT,
SO HE'S JUST LEAVING.

14:45.884 --> 14:49.805
- I'M HAPPY TO STAY--
- WHAT, ARE WE BARBARIANS?

14:49.888 --> 14:52.433
NO, I INSIST THAT YOU COME BACK
ON THE CORRECT NIGHT.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.147
- HELLO, MELANIE.

14:58.230 --> 14:59.898
THESE ARE FOR YOU.
- WHAT?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.359
WHO'S THIS GUY?
- I'M HER DATE.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.487
WHO'S THIS GUY?
- UH...

15:05.571 --> 15:08.574
THIS IS MELANIE'S GYNECOLOGIST.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.120
- HE'S HERE TO EXAMINE JOY.

15:16.206 --> 15:18.167
- YES! EXCELLENT.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.502
JOY HAS AN URGENT GYNECOLOGICAL
ISSUE THAT WE SHOULD REALLY

15:20.586 --> 15:23.881
DISCUSS IN THE KITCHEN DUE
TO ITS EMBARRASSING NATURE.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.427
- SURE.
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.974
- I'M SORRY.
I'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

15:34.058 --> 15:36.685
- THE RUBBER GLOVES
ARE UNDER THE SINK.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.362
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON HERE?

15:46.445 --> 15:48.697
- UM, WELL, YEAH.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.032
- LOOK, MELANIE'S JUST
PRETENDING TO BE ON A DATE

15:50.115 --> 15:52.159
SO HE'LL BRIBE A JUDGE.

15:54.745 --> 15:56.246
LET ME START AGAIN.

15:56.330 --> 15:58.332
SEE, THAT GUY'S GOT A CRUSH
ON HER BECAUSE SHE GOT REALLY

15:58.415 --> 16:02.336
DRUNK AND SPENT
THE NIGHT WITH HIM, BUT--

16:02.419 --> 16:03.712
I'LL LET YOU TWO
SORT THIS OUT.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.215
- LOOK, AARON...

16:06.298 --> 16:09.385
IF YOU KNEW ME YOU'D KNOW THAT
I AM NOT THE TYPE OF PERSON

16:09.468 --> 16:11.887
TO GET DRUNK AND SPEND
THE NIGHT WITH STRANGERS.

16:11.970 --> 16:15.099
- I READ YOUR CHART.

16:15.182 --> 16:17.059
- I TOLD HER NOT
TO WRITE THAT STUFF DOWN!

16:17.142 --> 16:20.229
WHAT WEIGHT DID SHE PUT?
NEVER MIND.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.022
OKAY, THEN HERE'S AN IDEA--

16:22.106 --> 16:23.941
WE STILL GO OUT TOMORROW NIGHT,
AS PLANNED,

16:24.024 --> 16:25.901
AND WE FORGET TONIGHT
EVER HAPPENED.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.069
I'VE ALREADY FORGOTTEN
ABOUT IT.

16:27.152 --> 16:31.740
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THE HECK
JUST HAPPENED IN THERE.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.283
YEAH, I'M MAKING IT WORSE,
AREN'T I?

16:33.367 --> 16:36.078
- A LITTLE BIT.

16:36.161 --> 16:39.248
- OH, OKAY.
I GET IT.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.583
GOOD-BYE, AARON.
- GOOD-BYE, MELANIE.

16:43.961 --> 16:46.380
- SO, YOU CAN IMAGINE
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

16:46.463 --> 16:47.673
JOY WAS SIMPLY TOO EMBARRASSED

16:47.756 --> 16:49.591
TO GO TO
A GYNECOLOGIST'S OFFICE,

16:49.675 --> 16:51.593
AND MELANIE IS JUST REALLY ANAL

16:51.677 --> 16:54.471
ABOUT KEEPING A CLEAN KITCHEN.

16:56.181 --> 16:57.766
- LOOK, I'M NOT AN IDIOT.

16:57.850 --> 17:01.270
- OH, THAT'S REALLY A SHAME
IN THIS INSTANCE.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.522
- SHE'S OBVIOUSLY
WITH THAT GUY,

17:03.605 --> 17:05.273
AND THIS WHOLE NIGHT WAS
A BUNCH OF B.S.

17:05.357 --> 17:06.817
TO KEEP ME WORKING
ON YOUR BOYFRIEND'S CASE.

17:06.900 --> 17:09.611
- OKAY, OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT,
AND I'M SORRY.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.114
LOOK, YOU SEEM LIKE
A REALLY GOOD GUY,

17:12.196 --> 17:15.826
AND--AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE
SOMETHING SO UNDERHANDED.

17:15.909 --> 17:17.953
BUT COULDN'T WE JUST GO BACK
TO OUR ORIGINAL AGREEMENT

17:18.037 --> 17:21.248
WHERE I GIVE YOU THE MONEY
AND YOU BRIBE THE JUDGE?

17:21.330 --> 17:25.127
- YEAH, WELL, IT TURNS OUT
EMMET'S JUDGE CAN'T BE BRIBED.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.295
IT'S STARTING
TO MAKE ME QUESTION

17:26.377 --> 17:29.715
THE AMERICAN JUDICIAL SYSTEM.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.468
- SO YOU CAME HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES?

17:32.551 --> 17:34.261
YOU LIED TO ME!

17:34.344 --> 17:36.096
- WELL, YOU LIED TO ME!
AND I'M OUTTA HERE.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.850
ANY CHANCE I COULD GET
A PLATE OF FOOD TO GO?

17:39.933 --> 17:41.685
- WILL YOU JUST
GET OUT OF HERE?

17:48.067 --> 17:49.693
- SO HOW'S EMMET HOLDING UP?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.571
- MM, HE'S DOING OKAY.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.114
I HAVE TO ADMIT IT.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.783
HE WAS RIGHT TO GO
THE LEGITIMATE ROUTE

17:55.866 --> 17:57.326
AND TAKE THE PLEA BARGAIN.

17:57.409 --> 18:00.996
- AND THE GOOD NEWS IS HE'LL
BE OUT IN LESS THAN A YEAR.

18:01.079 --> 18:04.041
- AT LEAST YOU'LL GET
TO VISIT HIM ALL THE TIME.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.501
- HEY, I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I MESSED THINGS UP

18:05.584 --> 18:06.627
BETWEEN YOU AND DR. AARON.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.504
- OH, NO, IT'S OKAY.

18:08.587 --> 18:10.506
MAYBE IT IS TOO SOON
FOR ME TO START DATING.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.673
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

18:11.757 --> 18:14.009
YOU LIKE HIM AND HE LIKES YOU.

18:14.092 --> 18:18.180
YOU'RE ALREADY AHEAD OF MOST
OF MY RELATIONSHIPS.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.184
- BUT I'VE SENT HIM TEXTS
AND HE HASN'T RESPONDED.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.729
- YOU KNOW, THERE IS A WAY
HE'D HAVE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.068
- MELANIE.

18:31.151 --> 18:32.653
- YOU WOULDN'T ANSWER MY TEXTS,

18:32.736 --> 18:35.030
SO I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
SO YOU'D HAVE TO SEE ME.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.949
I GOT YOU A PRESENT.

18:37.032 --> 18:40.118
A NEW UTERUS.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.955
MM, STILL HAS
THAT NEW UTERUS SMELL.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.544
COME ON,
THAT WAS PRETTY FUNNY.

18:48.627 --> 18:50.712
- IT WAS.
- [chuckles]

18:50.796 --> 18:52.506
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT,

18:52.589 --> 18:54.883
BUT I REALLY WAS JUST TRYING
TO HELP MY FRIEND.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.010
- WHICH MEANS YOU'RE
A NICE PERSON.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.387
- THANK YOU.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.430
- AND I'D LIKE TO GET TO KNOW

19:00.514 --> 19:02.933
THE GIRL THAT BROKE MY UTERUS.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.230
DINNER TONIGHT?
- YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.

19:08.313 --> 19:09.398
- I HAVE ONE MORE PATIENT
TO SEE.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.566
YOU CAN WAIT
IN THE WAITING ROOM.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.484
- OKAY.
WAIT, SO WHILE I'M WAITING,

19:12.568 --> 19:16.029
YOU'RE GONNA GET TO THIRD BASE
WITH A NAKED WOMAN?

19:16.113 --> 19:18.699
- THAT'S NOT REALLY
HOW DOCTORS THINK OF IT.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.868
- MM-HMM, IS SHE ATTRACTIVE?
- NO.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.911
- WOULD YOU TELL ME IF SHE WAS?
- NO.

19:22.995 --> 19:23.829
- IS THIS SOMETHING
I HAVE TO GET USED TO?

19:23.912 --> 19:25.914
- YEP!

19:28.834 --> 19:32.212
- I SAID GOOD-BYE TO THE ANIMALS
ON THE FARM,

19:32.296 --> 19:35.048
AND FLED POLAND
THAT VERY NIGHT.

19:35.132 --> 19:39.261
- THAT WAS "PASSAGE TO FREEDOM,"
BY JOY SCROGGS.

19:39.344 --> 19:42.097
DON'T CLAP!

19:42.180 --> 19:44.308
ONLY ONE PERSON DID
A FILM WORTHY OF AN "A."

19:44.391 --> 19:48.687
IN A CLEVER HOMAGE TO
THE GODZILLA FILMS OF THE 1950s,

19:48.770 --> 19:50.814
WHICH WARNED OF THE HORRORS
OF THE ATOMIC AGE,

19:50.898 --> 19:52.608
THIS FILM MAKER ALSO USED

19:52.691 --> 19:54.776
FRIGHTENING IMAGERY
TO PROVOKE THOUGHT.

19:54.860 --> 19:57.863
I GIVE YOU ELKA OSTROVSKY'S,
"MAN HANDS."

19:57.946 --> 19:59.698
- WAIT, WHAT?

19:59.781 --> 20:02.784
- I WAS MARRIED TO THE MOB.

20:02.868 --> 20:06.622
I LIVED THROUGH
THE HORRORS OF WAR.

20:06.705 --> 20:11.293
BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING
AS TERRIFYING AS...

20:11.376 --> 20:15.339
MAN HANDS.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.891
MAN HANDS.

20:28.226 --> 20:30.312
I WANTED THE "A."
