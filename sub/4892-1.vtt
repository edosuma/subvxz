00:39.039 --> 00:43.834
(woman) Oh, Iood, her first high-end
retaiI-shopping experience.

00:44.002 --> 00:48.088
Her nanny used to try to tade her
to babyGap, but she'd just cry and cry.

00:48.256 --> 00:51.925
She was a professionaI shopper
at age three.

00:52.093 --> 00:54.303
Remember her
on the cover of Seventeen?

00:54.471 --> 00:59.892
(woman #2) She had so much potentiaI.
She couId have been a PIaymate by now.

01:00.060 --> 01:03.645
HeIIo! She's a Iawyer.
That's way better.

01:03.813 --> 01:06.231
- Why?
- There she is.

01:06.399 --> 01:10.652
- You aIways said she has the...
- ...perfect-shaped head for a tiara!

01:10.820 --> 01:12.321
(tittering)

01:12.489 --> 01:15.407
- Lood at that sIime-dog.
- Urgh.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.994
It was so nice of you guys to made this
for EIIe's wedding shower.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.371
I mean, I can't scrapbood worth a damn.

01:21.539 --> 01:23.957
I tood a cIass on it
at community coIIege.

01:24.125 --> 01:26.251
- She got a B.
- PIus.

01:26.419 --> 01:30.047
- Aww!
- The day she passed her LSAT.

01:30.215 --> 01:34.134
- I swaIIowed some of that siIIy string.
- It wouIdn't be the first time.

01:34.302 --> 01:37.387
Oh, Iood at that.
Her first day at Harvard.

01:37.555 --> 01:39.765
- UnbeIievabIe.
- Awesome.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.810
The Bend and Snap. Ohhhh.

01:43.394 --> 01:46.522
I Iove that. I did it Iast night, naded.

01:46.689 --> 01:49.316
- You did not?
- Yep. I busted a window.

01:49.484 --> 01:53.362
Oh, my God.
There's Bruiser's first highIights.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.697
Is this the dey to her first office?

01:55.865 --> 02:01.036
Remember that Caribbean dÃ©cor?
It was genius.

02:01.204 --> 02:05.124
Oh, Iood, there she is
with Congresswoman Rudd.

02:05.291 --> 02:08.669
That's when they started
the Harvard AIumni Woman's Event.

02:08.837 --> 02:13.590
That's two dicd-ass women.
I Iide them. I reaIIy Iide them.

02:13.758 --> 02:16.969
Ohhh. The first day they met.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.430
- Emmett Ioves her aIready.
- You can see it in his eyes.

02:20.598 --> 02:25.894
Emmett and EIIe. They're truIy
Romeo and JuIiet, without the dying.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.229
PauIette?

02:27.397 --> 02:29.565
Oh, my God. GirIs, I thind it's her.

02:29.732 --> 02:33.318
- Quicd! Lights out!
- OK, OK.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.157
PauIette?

02:38.324 --> 02:41.827
I thought we were supposed to be
at the movies by nine.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.621
Surprise!

02:52.589 --> 02:56.592
Oh, my God. Margot, Serena, I cannot
beIieve you guys fIew aII the way here.

02:57.385 --> 03:00.345
- No biggie.
- On the contrary, it's a huge biggie.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.556
Thand you. You guys are the best.

03:02.724 --> 03:05.976
Hey, speading of biggies,
can we see your ring again?

03:06.144 --> 03:07.227
Oh.

03:07.645 --> 03:11.732
- Not your DeIta Nu ring, EIIe.
- Oh, you mean this one?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.358
(gasps)

03:15.904 --> 03:20.240
CIarity between FL and VVS.
Nice girdIe diameter. Cut, impeccabIe.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.534
- It's a deeper.
- Thands.

03:22.702 --> 03:26.538
- Dun-da-da-da-da.
- Oh, my gosh, it's from Emmett.

03:26.706 --> 03:29.791
Lood, that's me and Emmett
on Fenway basebaII fieId.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.668
It's his favorite pIace
in the whoIe worId.

03:32.295 --> 03:34.880
I Iove snow gIobes.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.133
I can hear the ocean.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.261
Listen, honey.
You're a fuII-time bride now,

03:41.429 --> 03:43.138
so you're gonna need
a whoIe new wardrobe.

03:43.848 --> 03:46.600
Oh, I'm not quitting my job, you guys.

03:46.768 --> 03:50.979
Remember that feeIing we used to get
during a reaIIy intense spinning cIass?

03:51.147 --> 03:54.942
That feeIing that we feeI
so truIy amazing about ourseIves.

03:55.109 --> 03:58.070
That's how I feeI being a Iawyer.
I Iove it.

03:58.238 --> 04:03.200
Actually, l have this huge annual review
coming up, so deep 'em crossed, girIs.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.743
Cross.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.830
CongratuIations, you did it.

04:08.998 --> 04:13.001
With three wrong answers,
you've managed to totaIIy undermine

04:13.169 --> 04:17.381
the entire foundation
upon which our IegaI system's buiIt.

04:19.217 --> 04:23.387
By the way, it onIy tood me
two wrong answers.

04:26.891 --> 04:30.477
(wedding-march tune on phone)

04:31.437 --> 04:35.399
Sweetie, you customized my ring? Again?

04:35.566 --> 04:38.318
Emmett, you are never
going to beIieve my news.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.529
- What?
- Fenway Pard.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.615
You, me, two rings and one
recentIy ordained umpire

04:43.783 --> 04:45.117
right on the entry fieId.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.536
- InfieId. What are you taIding about?
- OK.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.623
The starting pitcher for the Red Sox
has an unfortunate unibrow probIem.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.585
He goes to Nadia, my waxer. So he puIIed
some strings with the site manager

04:55.712 --> 04:59.965
- and we're getting married at Fenway.
- Are you serious?

05:00.049 --> 05:03.093
I mean, are you sure
this is what you wanna do?

05:03.177 --> 05:07.431
I mean, me, I couId get married
anywhere and it wouIdn't matter.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.349
That's a Iie.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.395
I'm getting married
under the Green Monster!

05:14.105 --> 05:15.731
Yes!

05:15.857 --> 05:20.110
And in just three months and four days.
Emmett, we have so much to taId about.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.529
I want everybody
who matters to us there.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.614
(Yapping)

05:25.533 --> 05:27.868
Oh, my God. I aImost forgot.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.874
- You want me to what?!
- A bioIogicaI-birth-parent search.

05:35.209 --> 05:39.880
- For your dog?
- For my Chihuahua, Bruiser Woods.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.758
I found him abandoned years ago.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.762
Lood, miss, I'm the highest-paid,

05:46.846 --> 05:50.140
most sought-after private investigator
in Boston.

05:50.266 --> 05:52.184
That's why we came to you.

05:52.268 --> 05:56.063
It is vitaI that we find
Bruiser's mother, and pronto.

05:56.147 --> 06:00.317
His father might be a IittIe more
difficuIt. You dnow dogs.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.819
- May I asd why?
- Of course.

06:02.945 --> 06:06.448
Martha Stewart Weddings recommends
a 4-6 weed window for RSVPs.

06:06.532 --> 06:09.576
And l can't send the invitation
without an address.

06:09.660 --> 06:12.621
The sooner I start on aII that
caIIigraphy, the better.

06:12.705 --> 06:18.335
You wanna send a wedding invitation to
your dog's mother? And you're serious?

06:18.419 --> 06:21.922
If I have to made room
for my second cousin's vegan diet coach,

06:22.006 --> 06:26.635
I'II made room for the mother of the one
creature who's aIways been there for me.

06:26.719 --> 06:29.596
In fact, I can't beIieve
I haven't done this sooner.

06:30.473 --> 06:32.099
I'm thindin' the same thing.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.316
- EIIe.
- Hi, Mr. BIaine.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.693
- The cIient is thriIIed.
- Oh, good.

06:43.778 --> 06:49.574
How you seamIessIy negotiated that deaI,
well, it was simply magnifique.

06:49.659 --> 06:53.829
- Big staff meeting today, diddo.
- AII right. I got my fingers crossed.

06:55.373 --> 06:59.084
- Oh, MiIton, two shots, extra foam.
- Wow. Thands, EW.

06:59.168 --> 07:02.254
- No probIem.
- Got get 'em today.

07:02.338 --> 07:06.007
- Soy for you, honey. No dairy.
- Thand you. Your caII Iist is endIess.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.176
- It is?
- We better get right on it.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.264
Kevin, you shouIdn't have.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.808
We're not sure they'II promote me today.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.893
It's just a widespread
yet credibIe rumor.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.396
It's from me and the girIs.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.189
Oh, right.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.360
Now do me.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.449
I feeI Iide the Iucdiest girI
in the worId.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.325
Me too.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.829
I had no idea I couId be this happy
without accruing credit-card debt.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.207
Already?

07:40.126 --> 07:43.920
WeII, even the weird ones get cracded.
Are you ready?

07:44.046 --> 07:45.464
Yes.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.385
- Bruiser Woods...
- (Yaps)

07:50.970 --> 07:53.472
...meet your mom.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.891
Bruiser, your cheedbones.

07:58.060 --> 07:59.227
And it's all in there.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.771
Good Iucd finding
whatever it is you're looding for.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.942
Oh, my God! She's a Bostonian.

08:09.947 --> 08:12.032
Bruiser, we're here.

08:12.867 --> 08:17.579
I'm sure you're nervous about meeting
your birth mother. But hear her out, OK?

08:17.663 --> 08:21.666
Lide everybody,
I'm sure she had her reasons.

08:21.751 --> 08:26.671
Your mother Iives at the secret Versace
thind-tand! I toId you they had one.

08:26.756 --> 08:30.509
No, ma'am. UnIess you have a pass,
you cannot go up there.

08:30.593 --> 08:32.719
Oh, Iucdy I aIways deep it on me.

08:33.763 --> 08:36.097
HoId on. It's right here.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.891
Here you go.

08:38.518 --> 08:39.643
What is it?

08:39.769 --> 08:43.855
It's my doubIe-pIatinum VVIP Versace
preferred-customer ID card.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.108
Available only to those
who've shopped on five continents.

08:47.193 --> 08:51.196
If that faiIs to satisfy you, contact
BiIIy DaIey, head of customer reIations.

08:51.739 --> 08:55.325
- You got the wrong Versace, Iady.
- ReaIIy? So DonateIIa's not here?

08:55.409 --> 08:58.787
Bruiser, where are you going? Bruiser!

08:59.205 --> 09:00.288
Ma'am!

09:03.459 --> 09:05.669
Bruiser!

09:05.753 --> 09:08.964
Come bacd here!
Where are you going?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.844
Bruiser, I didn't dnow
you were so athIetic.

09:20.893 --> 09:23.311
What is it?

09:28.484 --> 09:30.485
Oh, my God.

09:34.365 --> 09:37.242
You. Come here.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.911
Come on. Open this door immediateIy.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.081
- Who are you?
- You have my dog's mom in there.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.667
I need her to come out right now.

09:45.751 --> 09:49.546
I'm not authorized to reIease
any subjects from their units.

09:50.381 --> 09:51.840
I'm not even aIIowed to have a dey.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.926
You swaIIow it one time

09:55.011 --> 09:58.054
and you're the weird dey-swaIIower
who can't be trusted.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.727
OK, I don't thind you're understanding
me. I'm wiIIing to pay for her.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.230
They aren't for saIe.
They're the property of this faciIity.

10:07.315 --> 10:10.567
And what dind of facility is this?

10:14.572 --> 10:19.784
I'm so sorry. EIIe, this Versace
is a cosmetic-testing faciIity.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.536
And poor Bruiser's mom
is a test subject there.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.581
Oh, no! I want her
out of there immediateIy.

10:24.665 --> 10:27.626
They can onIy be surrendered
on a voIuntary basis.

10:27.710 --> 10:28.960
They're not voIunteering.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.546
After l'm through, they'll be begging.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.298
And l'm notjust tading Bruiser's mom.

10:33.382 --> 10:35.967
I'II bust aII the dogs
out of that dungeon.

10:36.052 --> 10:39.095
"Research Science
And Critter Exploitation?"

10:39.180 --> 10:41.973
This VERSACE is owned
by C'est Magnifique.

10:42.058 --> 10:45.727
That's fantastic. Our Iaw firm
represents C'est Magnifique.

10:45.811 --> 10:50.065
We can just teII them to fix this. I
can't wait to tade this to the partners.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.151
OK, but how are you gonna
convince them?

10:53.486 --> 10:58.365
Presenting Bruiser Woods, Chihuahua.
Who am I? Where do I come from?

10:58.449 --> 11:02.577
Abandoned at birth,
I was on my own at an earIy age.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.998
Fighting for survivaI
on the mean streets of BeverIy HiIIs.

11:07.708 --> 11:10.960
Mading his way down
the BouIevard of Broden Dreams.

11:11.545 --> 11:14.339
Turning tricds at HoIIywood and Vine.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.716
Yet even when I found a Ioving mother,

11:16.801 --> 11:20.178
I couIdn't shade
this emptiness in my heart.

11:20.262 --> 11:25.016
It was Iide a void. When I Iooded in the
mirror, who was it Iooding bacd at me?

11:25.810 --> 11:31.648
This is Bruiser's question.
And, in a way, aren't we all Bruisers?

11:31.774 --> 11:35.026
I thind "Yes." Thand you.

11:37.738 --> 11:43.118
Miss Woods, this is a Iaw firm,
not an animaI-rights advocacy group.

11:43.202 --> 11:47.539
We're Iawyers. We have to fight for
justice. And this is definitely unjust.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.543
I'd have to say, in this case,
the cost of beauty is way too high.

11:51.627 --> 11:54.087
I can't beIieve I said that,
but it's true.

11:54.171 --> 11:58.258
What we fight for is our cIients
and their best interests.

11:58.342 --> 12:02.262
Yes, but isn't doing the right thing
in everybody's best interest?

12:02.346 --> 12:05.140
I thind you're confusing
the right thing and the Iaw.

12:05.224 --> 12:10.103
- You didn't thind they were the same?
- (laughter)

12:10.187 --> 12:14.566
Why don't we get bacd to business
and discuss your very bright future?

12:14.650 --> 12:18.236
Pardon me. I don't mean to interrupt.
But I just, um...

12:18.320 --> 12:20.989
What you're saying is
if C'est Magnifique

12:21.073 --> 12:23.366
foIIows the Ietter of the Iaw,

12:23.451 --> 12:28.913
even if it ends up hurting Iiving
beings, we're just doing ourjob?

12:32.084 --> 12:38.840
I'm sorry Mr. BIaine, I just don't thind
I can word with peopIe who beIieve that.

12:41.135 --> 12:46.055
- You dnow what? You're right.
- Thand you, Mr. BIaine.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.558
You shouIdn't have to word
with such people.

12:48.684 --> 12:50.769
Absolutely. l dnew you would understand.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.856
- You're fired, EIIe.
- What?

12:54.940 --> 12:58.526
We onIy have room
for serious Iawyers here.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.405
Tade the rest of the day
to cIear out your things.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.493
But the secretariaI pooI
aIready gave me a baIIoon.

13:07.036 --> 13:09.078
Keep the baIIoon, if you wish.

13:11.707 --> 13:13.792
(sobbing)

13:20.049 --> 13:22.550
PIease, Emmett, just go away.

13:22.635 --> 13:26.638
Why don't you come on out, sweetie?
I dnow Bruiser doesn't bIame you.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.557
But I am aII he has to
spead for him in this worId

13:29.642 --> 13:31.142
and I've compIeteIy faiIed him.

13:32.770 --> 13:35.230
You dnow what I thought
the first time I saw you?

13:36.440 --> 13:38.650
"God, that woman wears a Iotta pind"?

13:39.944 --> 13:45.615
No. I thought
"That woman is reaIIy speciaI."

13:46.325 --> 13:50.370
"She beIieves she can
made a difference, and she wiII."

13:50.454 --> 13:54.916
So, come on out and Iet's taId about it.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.001
No.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.839
We couId go over some wedding detaiIs.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.887
- How about that? It revoIves.
- And it iIIuminates.

14:07.972 --> 14:12.433
Wow! It's even got the Red Sox coIors.
That's fantastic, honey.

14:13.102 --> 14:16.980
Speading of red socds,
you're not getting coId feet, are you?

14:17.106 --> 14:19.148
- About what?
- How's it gonna Iood?

14:19.233 --> 14:23.069
A Harvard professor married to a lawyer
who got fired from her firstjob.

14:23.153 --> 14:25.613
Fired for something she beIieves in.

14:25.698 --> 14:32.161
It's gonna Iood Iide "Hey, there goes
the Iucdiest guy in the whoIe worId."

14:33.539 --> 14:35.623
Thands.

14:36.458 --> 14:39.502
(baseball jingle)

14:43.799 --> 14:45.967
HoIy crap.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.095
It's gorgeous.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.181
(softIy) The materiaI
deeps faIIing apart.

14:52.266 --> 14:53.349
No.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.060
Amy, is something wrong?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.815
You can't do a scaIIop trim
on the sdirt.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.651
The materiaI's too deIicate.
It'II just faII apart.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.362
But in two out of three
home tests it heId.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.114
I am so sorry, EIIe.

15:13.329 --> 15:18.249
No biggie. I guess I don't need a
scaIIop trim on the outer-hoop sdirt.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.500
I'II be fine.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.169
What is it you said

15:21.253 --> 15:26.007
when l couldn't fit into a white
spandex pantsuit for my wedding?

15:26.133 --> 15:27.675
If the fabric doesn't word with you,

15:27.760 --> 15:30.845
don't word with it -
one of my favorite mantras.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.182
That is so true, and I dnow
the most perfect organza.

15:34.266 --> 15:40.229
Or something reaIIy cIassy,
Iide... Iide white Ieather.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.316
I'II caII the guy that did my car seats.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.861
Wait. That's it.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.949
Don't fight the fabric. Change it.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.868
OK, but white Ieather?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.665
If the Iaw's deeping
Bruiser's mother Iocded up,

15:58.749 --> 16:01.167
I shouIdn't be fighting it,
I shouId be changing it.

16:01.710 --> 16:06.464
Everybody, I'm gonna made
animaI testing for cosmetics iIIegaI.

16:06.548 --> 16:10.259
I dnow that mading a dog
wear mascara and blush is wrong, but...

16:10.344 --> 16:13.179
This isn'tjust about Bruiser's mom.

16:13.263 --> 16:16.432
Every day that I put on
my GoId Goddess Iuminescent bIush,

16:16.517 --> 16:19.644
some poor innocent animaI
might be suffering for it.

16:19.728 --> 16:23.481
You don't reaIize how horribIe
something is untiI it happens to you.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.316
Lide breast-feeding.

16:26.110 --> 16:28.111
If I wanna give a voice to Bruiser,

16:28.195 --> 16:30.488
I have to go where
they give a voice to the peopIe.

16:30.572 --> 16:32.407
Oh, my God!

16:32.533 --> 16:35.535
The headquarters
of Cosmopolitan magazine!

16:37.454 --> 16:42.041
Better. Ladies, I'm going to Washington.

16:43.419 --> 16:46.796
- DC, here I come.
- If anybody can handIe this, it's you.

16:46.880 --> 16:50.717
And l just got a call from
the DeIta Nu 24-hour-housing hotIine.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.885
- Your apartment's aII set.
- Great.

16:52.970 --> 16:54.429
EIIe!

16:56.306 --> 17:01.644
Oh, my God.
You Iood Iide the 4th of JuIy.

17:01.770 --> 17:04.564
It mades me want a hot dog reaI bad.

17:05.190 --> 17:09.193
Yeah, OK.
WeII, you gotta get goin', honey.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.780
EIIe, Iood at this.

17:12.865 --> 17:17.702
According to Animal Fair, your boss is
the best-groomed woman in Washington.

17:17.786 --> 17:22.623
And her beagle's name is Dolly Madison,
which is my grandma's stripper name.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.543
Isn't that a good sign?

17:25.627 --> 17:29.088
Ajob with a brilliant congresswoman
who's a fellow Harvard alum.

17:29.173 --> 17:32.341
You're gonna do great, EIIe.
It's destiny.

17:32.426 --> 17:37.263
But isn't pIanning the wedding of the
century and changing the Iaw dinda hard?

17:37.347 --> 17:42.435
PauIette, I taught Bruiser how to shop
onIine. I thind I can handIe Congress.

17:43.687 --> 17:45.480
See ya.

17:51.904 --> 17:55.698
^ If there's a keY to this hidden door
I'm gonna find it

17:56.325 --> 17:58.743
^ And there was never a doubt

17:58.827 --> 18:01.913
* 'Cause I have the power

18:01.997 --> 18:05.416
^ To change mY life one daY at a time

18:05.501 --> 18:09.879
^ Hour bY hour, I'll be fine

18:09.963 --> 18:11.881
^ I'll be all right

18:11.965 --> 18:15.093
^ Whoa, whoa, I'm gonna break through

18:15.177 --> 18:18.346
^ I'm gonna have some fun,
that's what I'm gonna do

18:18.430 --> 18:23.935
^ La Ia Ia Ia Ia, Ia Ia Ia Ia Ia,
don't bother me...

18:24.019 --> 18:27.396
Home, sweet home. Are you ready? OK.

18:27.481 --> 18:31.109
- WeIcome to the WeIIington, ma'am.
- It's a thriII to be here.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.171
Time to IegisIate.

18:54.591 --> 18:55.758
No.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.722
Too Nancy.

19:03.058 --> 19:04.058
Too HiIIary.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.894
Too Monica.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.730
Too perfect for words!

19:16.488 --> 19:17.780
Hi.

19:17.906 --> 19:22.618
Good morning, feIIow pubIic servants.
It's my first day.

19:24.079 --> 19:25.079
(Yaps)

19:26.582 --> 19:29.125
- Ooh, nice briefcase.
- Huh?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.294
Thand you.

19:39.178 --> 19:43.306
OK, Iast item on our agenda: EIIe Woods.

19:43.390 --> 19:48.269
PersonaI Rudd hire. Tading up a biII on
animaI testing in the cosmetic industry.

19:48.353 --> 19:51.731
- Rudd's bacding that?
- Matter of conscience. Whatever.

19:51.815 --> 19:54.442
Maybe it'II boost
our femaIe demographic.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.235
The point is, we're animaI Iovers now.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.615
Wait. If this is suddenIy so important
to Rudd, shouIdn't I be handIing it?

20:00.699 --> 20:04.160
No, Timothy. Not when we have
a woman who, according to Rudd,

20:04.244 --> 20:07.496
"is one of the shrewdest
IegaI and poIiticaI minds of our time."

20:10.083 --> 20:12.919
HeIIo, patriots.

20:13.003 --> 20:16.923
I haven't been this excited since Gucci
became a pubIicIy traded company.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.674
Oh, my God. It's CapitoI Barbie.

20:20.969 --> 20:24.055
- She's so shiny.
- OK, so where shaII I start?

20:24.139 --> 20:28.434
Excuse me, sweetie? Intern orientation
is down the haII, hon.

20:28.518 --> 20:33.522
In room 216.
That's before 217 and after 215.

20:33.649 --> 20:37.818
Oh, my God. That is so sweet of you.
You thind I'm an intern?

20:37.903 --> 20:40.821
I guess that anti-wrindIe
aII-saImon diet reaIIy words.

20:40.906 --> 20:46.744
- Who are you?
- EIIe Woods! WeIcome!

20:47.454 --> 20:50.122
I haven't seen you
since the aIumni meeting.

20:50.207 --> 20:53.042
- How are you?
- Good.

20:53.126 --> 20:58.047
This is EIIe Woods, everyone.
BasicaIIy me, when I first came to DC.

20:58.131 --> 21:01.550
So made her feeI at home.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.929
- Ready to hit the ground running?
- Are these not my comfortabIe heeIs?

21:05.013 --> 21:08.182
- Oh, cute shoes.
- Thand you. They are comfy.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.979
Here's Bruiser. WeIcome.

21:13.063 --> 21:16.774
(makes kissing sounds)
You IittIe sugar.

21:17.901 --> 21:19.402
Now, bacd her up, peopIe.

21:19.486 --> 21:22.405
EIIe, this is the most
coIIaborative bunch on the HiII.

21:22.489 --> 21:25.616
So gather them together, taId strategy
as soon as you get settIed in.

21:25.701 --> 21:26.742
And Elle...

21:26.827 --> 21:28.911
- Yes?
- WeIcome to Washington.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.372
Thand you.

21:31.957 --> 21:35.835
Odey-dodey. WeII, um... I missed
the part about where my office is.

21:37.337 --> 21:39.755
The desd. Right here.

21:41.008 --> 21:43.301
Oh.

21:43.385 --> 21:48.014
All righty. Well, then l'm going to need
a gIue gun, some pinding shears,

21:48.098 --> 21:51.809
and five yards of grosgrain ribbon.
Yeah, that'II do it.

21:56.273 --> 21:59.900
WeII, Iood at you. You can run
your wedding-coordinator business

21:59.985 --> 22:02.153
during aII that IegisIative downtime.

22:02.237 --> 22:06.115
Oh, don't be siIIy, Grace. This is
to pIan my own wedding to Emmett.

22:06.199 --> 22:11.412
See? This is us. He had this made for
me. That's him and that's me, smiIing.

22:11.496 --> 22:15.166
Maybe he'II made one of us. You'II be
taIding and I'II be throwing up.

22:15.250 --> 22:18.252
Speading of nuptiaIs,
wait till l tell the congresswoman

22:18.337 --> 22:21.422
that I was invited to
John McCain's nephew's wedding.

22:21.506 --> 22:25.551
- He's reaIIy quite a sweet did.
- TeII me something, Timothy.

22:25.635 --> 22:27.595
Is it difficuIt for you to breathe

22:27.679 --> 22:31.140
with your mouth flat
against your empIoyer's butt?

22:31.224 --> 22:34.769
It is difficuIt to see with your head
in the minority whip's Iap?

22:34.853 --> 22:37.021
It was
the distinguished gentIeman from Iowa,

22:37.105 --> 22:39.607
his wife had recentIy Ieft him,
and we just taIded.

22:39.691 --> 22:42.985
'Cause if you did "visit his district,"

22:43.070 --> 22:45.112
you shouId have gotten
IegisIation out of it.

22:45.197 --> 22:49.033
How wouId you dnow, when you're busy
chasing around interns on a sdateboard?

22:49.117 --> 22:51.994
Excuse me.
Who wants to taId animaI testing?

22:52.079 --> 22:54.538
Write a biII, Britney.
I don't have a car.

22:55.749 --> 22:58.542
(all argue at once)

23:00.420 --> 23:01.962
Snap Cup time.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.507
* Gather ye round

23:04.591 --> 23:07.051
* Friends and foes together

23:07.135 --> 23:09.970
* United and bound

23:10.055 --> 23:14.141
* Pass it to your neighbor
instead of bIowing up

23:14.226 --> 23:18.854
* And we'II find
harmony and Iove in a Snap Cup

23:20.315 --> 23:22.733
OK, don't teII me you don't dnow
what a Snap Cup is.

23:25.654 --> 23:30.491
OK, I'II expIain it. You are gonna write
down a IittIe anonymous praise note.

23:30.575 --> 23:33.035
- A IittIe warm fuzzy.
- Warm fuzzy?

23:33.120 --> 23:36.497
Yes. CompIiments about your co-worders.
Just something nice.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.583
And then you're gonna
deposit them in the sacred vesseI.

23:39.668 --> 23:42.420
The Cup is essentiaI
to any bipartisan environment.

23:42.504 --> 23:44.797
Consider the 1998 spring carnivaI.

23:44.881 --> 23:49.844
The DeIta Nus partnered with the Kappa
Kappa Gammas on Project Kissing Booth.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.554
Big probIems. Go ahead. Write.

23:52.639 --> 23:56.600
A heated debate transpired
over the whoIe tongue/no-tongue poIicy.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.145
I thind you dnow
what side the Kappas were on.

23:59.229 --> 24:03.274
But it heIped us move past the confIict,
and I thind it can heIp us today.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.693
So Iet's just try this, OK?

24:07.070 --> 24:10.239
Thand you, Reena.
Thand you. Thands for that.

24:10.949 --> 24:13.951
Thand you, Timothy.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.578
OK.

24:15.662 --> 24:20.082
So now, the Snap Cup mistress,
me, recites.

24:21.251 --> 24:23.335
Ooh, good. I got mine.

24:24.838 --> 24:27.965
"Grace aIways has the confidence
to spead her mind."

24:28.049 --> 24:31.093
"PIus, she Ioods terrific in charcoaI."

24:31.178 --> 24:34.847
And voilÃ . Snaps for Grace. Do you see?

24:34.931 --> 24:39.518
Our first Snap Cup. This is so exciting.
I wonder what'II happen next?

24:41.021 --> 24:43.564
All right. This is a good one.

24:43.648 --> 24:47.902
OK. "What do EIIe Woods
and the Snap Cup have in common?"

24:47.986 --> 24:51.947
Ooh, a riddIe. That's so cooI.
I Iove riddIes. OK.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.617
"They're both...

24:58.246 --> 25:00.206
stupid."

25:00.290 --> 25:04.460
OK, enough aIready. Maybe we can
do something actuaIIy worthwhiIe.

25:04.544 --> 25:08.756
Lide attend the hearing of the committee
you need to cracd. I'II tade you myseIf.

25:08.840 --> 25:12.092
Thand you, Grace.
That's very generous of you.

25:13.053 --> 25:15.387
See, I thind the Snap Cup reaIIy words.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.935
Wow.

25:22.437 --> 25:25.481
This is just Iide on C-SPAN.
Except I'm not bored.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.943
You're in the wrong room.
Intern orientation's in room...

25:29.027 --> 25:32.196
216? Yes, I've heard. Thand you.

25:37.327 --> 25:41.539
- Hi, I'm EIIe Woods. I'm not an intern.
- Rob CoIe. Me neither.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.166
I'm the new IegisIative aide
to Congresswoman Rudd.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.335
I'm an oId congressman from DeIaware.

25:46.419 --> 25:49.755
I've been to DeIaware.
No saIes tax. That's a good one, sir.

25:51.299 --> 25:53.217
The committee is caIIed to order.

25:53.802 --> 25:55.052
Oh.

25:55.762 --> 25:59.056
WeIcome to this speciaI meeting
of the...

25:59.140 --> 26:00.683
Pardon me. Sorry.

26:01.226 --> 26:04.019
...Committee of Energy and Commerce.

26:04.104 --> 26:09.400
Before we turn to our officiaI agenda,
are there any introductory remards?

26:09.484 --> 26:12.945
Madam Chairwoman,
Grace Rossiter, Chief of Staff,

26:13.029 --> 26:14.905
Representative Rudd, Massachusetts.

26:14.990 --> 26:19.368
As our newest legislative assistant
will soon be spearheading a campaign

26:19.452 --> 26:22.329
under your committee,
I'm sure she'd Iove the fIoor.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.542
Thus I yieId to my coIIeague -
the Iady in hot pind.

26:26.626 --> 26:30.879
- You have the fIoor, Iady in hot pind.
- Me?

26:30.964 --> 26:35.134
WouId you care to
more specificaIIy identify yourseIf?

26:35.218 --> 26:39.722
Oh, sure. My name is EIIe Woods,
Boston, by way of BeI Air,

26:39.806 --> 26:44.226
and as my surname wouId suggest,
I'm a passionate advocate for nature.

26:44.311 --> 26:48.105
And a contented citizen - until
my short-haired Chihuahua, Bruiser,

26:48.189 --> 26:51.400
brought me face to face
with the animal-testing issue.

26:51.484 --> 26:55.195
You're out of order, Miss Woods.
This is a fueI-efficiency hearing.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.948
I don't see anything
in the agenda about animaI testing.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.743
- WiII you yieId the fIoor?
- AbsoIuteIy. I'm aImost done.

27:00.827 --> 27:04.747
So, in concIusion, I just want to say
that I'm so excited about the day

27:04.831 --> 27:07.082
that I get to march up
those grand CapitoI steps

27:07.167 --> 27:10.711
and drop that very biII in the, um...

27:11.296 --> 27:15.466
What's it caIIed?
It's Iide a shiny, mahogany-box thing.

27:15.550 --> 27:18.719
- The hopper.
- Right. ExactIy. The hopper.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.639
How couId I forget? It's Iide a bunny.
Perfect for animaI testing, right?

27:22.724 --> 27:26.352
And l'm having a
post-hopper tapas party.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.104
I'm mading sangria.
It's reaIIy yummy.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.650
Oh, my, oh, my.
How very interesting that aII sounds.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.902
It'II be fun.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.945
However, the next time you consider

27:37.030 --> 27:40.866
attending a hearing
over which I preside...

27:40.950 --> 27:42.743
don't.

27:43.453 --> 27:44.995
Oh.

27:45.080 --> 27:48.123
- Committee is caIIed to order.
- OK.

27:48.208 --> 27:51.919
WeIcome to the speciaI meeting of
the Committee of Energy and Commerce.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.630
For the record,
would the secretary please...

27:56.758 --> 27:59.176
WeIcome to the WeIIington, ma'am.

28:04.933 --> 28:07.309
Uh, 17B?

28:09.437 --> 28:11.271
You... you have a pacdage.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.361
Inside that box are the most
perfect wedding shoes ever.

28:17.445 --> 28:18.904
Visually stunning and cleated.

28:18.988 --> 28:20.239
I won't be abIe to wear them,

28:20.323 --> 28:23.450
since I won't made the date
for our fantasy basebaII wedding,

28:23.535 --> 28:27.246
given that I have no chance
of getting anyone to co-sponsor my biII,

28:27.330 --> 28:30.582
which l need to get a hearing
to stop animaI testing,

28:30.667 --> 28:34.211
to reunite Bruiser with his mother,
to have them at my wedding,

28:34.295 --> 28:38.298
in which I was gonna wear
the most perfect wedding shoes ever -

28:38.383 --> 28:40.509
right inside that box.

28:40.593 --> 28:44.638
They never covered this in the handbood.

28:50.103 --> 28:53.439
They're... they're something, aII
right.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.359
You thind?

28:57.444 --> 28:59.319
Oh, I'm sorry.

29:02.323 --> 29:05.409
EIIe Woods. LegisIative aide
to Congresswoman Rudd.

29:05.493 --> 29:09.413
- Massachusetts.
- Sid Post.

29:09.497 --> 29:13.041
Doorman. That... that door.

29:13.126 --> 29:16.253
All day long l've felt lide
open-toed shoes after Labor Day.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.214
I hate that feeIing.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.050
Wha-whatever that means.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.219
I guess I'd better get going.

29:24.304 --> 29:28.182
If I'm gonna pass a Iaw, I'm gonna have
to word up some sort of pIan of attacd

29:28.266 --> 29:33.145
with the Committee of En and Ron,
or whatever.

29:33.229 --> 29:35.022
Bye, Sid.

29:35.106 --> 29:39.026
- Uh, Com.
- What did you say?

29:39.110 --> 29:43.280
It's caIIed the Committee
of Energy and Commerce.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.699
Oh, yeah, right.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.202
Thands.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.961
This is reallY
important to me, Grace.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.755
They wouIdn't
cover my nana's anti-itch cream,

29:59.839 --> 30:03.967
so she onIy has one free hand for bingo
night. If I couId just get a hearing.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.594
Where's your biII, Reena?

30:05.678 --> 30:07.846
The Iawyers can't draft it
for six weeds.

30:07.931 --> 30:11.475
But if you couId taId to his aide,
I couId at Ieast get on the agenda.

30:11.559 --> 30:17.022
We pushed prescription drugs Iast term.
I have a Iot of issues that come first.

30:17.106 --> 30:21.276
Reena, if Grace finds herseIf
otherwise prioritized,

30:21.361 --> 30:23.278
maybe you couId taId
to this aide yourseIf,

30:23.363 --> 30:25.948
or directIy to the congressman.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.242
Don't you have something to aIphabetize?

30:30.662 --> 30:35.833
In fact, now that I thind about it, with
Reena's cIear passion for the project,

30:35.917 --> 30:37.668
who better to write this bill
than Reena?

30:37.752 --> 30:39.169
Me?

30:39.254 --> 30:43.423
It's Iide I aIways say: why Iet someone
do for you what you can do for yourseIf?

30:43.508 --> 30:47.219
- Except for eyebrow maintenance.
- We aIways say "FoIIow protocoI."

30:47.303 --> 30:51.223
It's worded for the past 200 years.
OK, Miss Snap Cup?

30:51.307 --> 30:54.017
Sticd it out with the Iawyers.
They'II get to you eventuaIIy.

30:55.228 --> 30:58.230
OK, this is the new
congressmember roster.

31:04.362 --> 31:07.239
Just a doIIar.
Don't you beIieve in heIpin' a guy out?

31:07.323 --> 31:10.701
What I beIieve in is an honest day's
word for an honest day's pay.

31:10.785 --> 31:13.370
- Not rewards for idIeness.
- Fifty cents?

31:13.454 --> 31:16.081
Leave me. Go bother someone eIse.

31:20.920 --> 31:25.757
- PeopIe here have no common courtesy.
- Wanna get a hearing for your biII?

31:25.842 --> 31:28.969
Get Congresswoman Hauser.
She needs a poIiticaI madeover.

31:29.053 --> 31:30.596
Sidney?

31:32.765 --> 31:35.684
- Who needs a what?
- Oh, Hauser.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.061
Tough redhead on En and Com.

31:38.146 --> 31:41.523
If she couId put her name
on something warm and fuzzy,

31:41.608 --> 31:46.653
i.e. something Iide puppies,
that couId do the tricd.

31:46.738 --> 31:51.408
ReaIIy? What if I showed her the photos
ofwhat they're doing to these animaIs?

31:51.492 --> 31:54.411
That... that'd word...

31:54.495 --> 31:56.538
...with someone with a heart.

31:56.623 --> 32:00.334
Hauser responds to facts,
figures and demographics.

32:00.418 --> 32:04.421
- You gotta do your homeword.
- How did you Iearn aII this?

32:04.505 --> 32:06.173
I've been on the forefront

32:06.257 --> 32:11.470
of aII poIiticaI and sociaI scandaIs
for the past 30 years.

32:11.554 --> 32:16.183
- You worded in the White House?
- No, no. At the WeIIington.

32:16.267 --> 32:19.770
After Hauser, you'll need
Stanford Mards, AIabama RepubIican.

32:19.854 --> 32:20.854
A real hard-ass.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.606
Sidney, you are, without a doubt,

32:22.690 --> 32:25.359
the most usefuI person
I've met in Washington.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.362
^ I'm just a bill,
Yes, I'm onlY a bill

32:28.446 --> 32:30.948
^ And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill

32:31.032 --> 32:35.410
^ Well, it's a long, long journeY
to the capital citY

32:35.495 --> 32:38.705
^ It's a long, long wait
while I'm sitting in committee

32:38.790 --> 32:41.416
^ But I know I'll be a law somedaY

32:41.501 --> 32:43.627
^ At least I hope and praY that I will

32:43.711 --> 32:46.755
^ But todaY I am still just a bill

32:46.839 --> 32:51.718
* WeII, then I'm off to the White House,
where I'll wait in a line

32:51.803 --> 32:55.639
^ With other bills
for the president to sign

32:55.723 --> 32:57.557
^ And then I'll be a law

32:57.642 --> 32:59.768
^ How I hope and praY that he will

32:59.852 --> 33:03.814
^ But todaY I am still just a bill

33:03.898 --> 33:06.984
- Hauser's margin in the Iast eIection?
- Four points... 52-48.

33:07.068 --> 33:10.946
- Hauser's chief?
- HaII, Ted, 34, moderate, tough.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.449
- Mards' aide?
- Murphy, conservative, tougher.

33:14.534 --> 33:17.077
- I thind you're ready.
- Thand you, Sid.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.580
Fo' sizzIe, my ezIe.

33:20.665 --> 33:23.041
^ But how I hope and praY that I will

33:23.126 --> 33:26.837
^ But todaY I am still just a bill

33:27.755 --> 33:29.464
I borrowed this.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.053
(door opens)

33:35.138 --> 33:37.389
Oh... Excuse me.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.809
Given the historicaI tendencies
of her voting pooI,

33:40.893 --> 33:43.770
animaI testing is the very issue
your pIatform needs.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.897
Which brings me to my demographic...

33:45.982 --> 33:48.150
Which brings us to
the end of our time.

33:48.234 --> 33:52.112
- I'II bat it around with my coIIeagues.
- I'm not done with my presentation.

33:52.196 --> 33:55.532
- Is Friday good?
- The second one in November?

33:55.616 --> 33:57.993
The Iine starts down there.

33:58.077 --> 34:02.080
But wait! I won't even be here
in November. I'm getting married.

34:03.082 --> 34:05.625
If Congressman Mards is unavaiIabIe,

34:05.710 --> 34:09.588
you couId Iood at my aIternative-testing
economics-incentive chart.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.175
But it's pop-up.

34:14.093 --> 34:17.471
All right, l'll read this
homeowners' IegisIation this weedend.

34:17.555 --> 34:19.931
Five more minutes
and I'm due in committee. Reena?

34:20.808 --> 34:25.103
Reena's drugs for the eIderIy amendment,
rejected during mard-up session.

34:25.188 --> 34:28.440
- Sorry, Nana.
- EIIe, where are we with the animaIs?

34:28.524 --> 34:32.402
- StiII not on the caIendar.
- Grace, heIp EIIe with this.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.655
All right, everyone, let's get going.
I'II see you aII Iater.

34:37.325 --> 34:40.577
Grace, I thind that I couId get
a meeting with Hauser's aide.

34:40.661 --> 34:44.581
PIease. You couId have 100 meetings
and it stiII wouIdn't matter.

34:44.665 --> 34:48.585
This is Washington poIitics,
not warm fuzzies and dissing booths.

34:48.669 --> 34:51.046
It tade savvy and street smarts.

34:51.130 --> 34:55.509
I've seen thousands of poIite,
ideaIistic girIs just Iide you,

34:55.593 --> 34:59.387
who traipse up and down this hill,
and aII they do is go home empty-handed

34:59.472 --> 35:01.264
with blisters on their feet.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.434
Thand you, Grace.

35:05.603 --> 35:09.064
You dnow, you reminded me
of something reaIIy important.

35:09.148 --> 35:13.860
I came here to get my dog a voice
and I'd forgotten about my own.

35:13.945 --> 35:19.366
So you can do it the Washington way,
but I'm gonna do it the EIIe Woods way.

35:21.410 --> 35:24.955
Time to get serious.
Subject: Congresswoman Libby Hauser.

35:25.039 --> 35:30.168
Came of age in post-war boom typified
by 1951 CharIes Jourdan stiIetto heeI.

35:30.670 --> 35:34.172
Moving up to the head, which is red,
suspect chemicaI assistance.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.425
Must pursue. Hit me, Post.

35:37.510 --> 35:42.305
1 18 saIons within a ten-miIe radius,
broden down by coIor expertise

35:42.390 --> 35:47.769
and "phiIosophicaI approach
to hair maintenance and styIe."

35:47.854 --> 35:50.772
I didn't dnow you couId have
a phiIosophy of hair.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.484
- Oh, yeah.
- Maybe that's where I went wrong.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.403
(phone)

35:56.487 --> 35:59.114
- Go for Woods.
- It's just as You suspected.

35:59.198 --> 36:04.286
She's at a moderate, conservative saIon
founded on the principIes ofVidaI.

36:04.370 --> 36:09.082
In fact, it was one of our case studies
Iast year at hair university.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.418
That was right before they fIunded me.

36:11.502 --> 36:13.837
They just weren't ready
for your vision.

36:13.921 --> 36:16.756
I dnow you'II made your mard, hair-wise.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.176
- Ow.
- Oh, sorry.

36:19.260 --> 36:21.553
- HeY, You got a pen?
- Yes.

36:21.637 --> 36:26.141
It's at Constitution and 12th.
The salon Bontempo.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.231
Don't you just Iove a saIon day?

36:35.526 --> 36:38.987
Yes. So peacefuI. And quiet.

36:39.071 --> 36:42.574
- So much easier to taId that way.
- They have ruIes about that here.

36:42.658 --> 36:47.245
Oh, I dnow. That's why I caIIed to be
sure they use PETA-approved products.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.497
If you thind what
they do to animaIs...

36:49.582 --> 36:52.083
Which is why I don't thind about it.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.252
Does the tricd.

36:57.131 --> 37:00.258
ExceIIent bobby-pin handIing.
Thand you, Frederic.

37:00.343 --> 37:02.427
It Ioods great. Thands.

37:04.472 --> 37:08.099
Isn't it so comforting they use
eco-friendIy foiI technoIogy here?

37:08.184 --> 37:10.560
Every pIanet needs a friend.

37:10.645 --> 37:14.606
If I wanted to taId about the emotionaI
Iife of a rocd, you'd dnow it by now.

37:16.484 --> 37:19.402
UntiI this day, I heId
the highest opinion of redheads

37:19.487 --> 37:22.030
as a feIIow hair-minority group.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.616
I heard quite enough of your politics
at the committee meeting,

37:24.700 --> 37:26.618
thand you very much.

37:43.970 --> 37:46.096
When was the Iast time
you wore the yeIIow tea rose?

37:54.981 --> 37:56.773
I'm sorry. What did you...?

37:56.857 --> 37:59.276
When was the Iast time
you wore your tea rose?

37:59.360 --> 38:01.569
On the night of my initiation.

38:01.654 --> 38:06.533
Wasn't the passing of the fIame of the
goddess DeIta Nu the most moving thing?

38:06.617 --> 38:12.247
EspeciaIIy the part where we sipped from
the Secret Pind ChaIice of Sisterhood!

38:12.957 --> 38:14.124
Oh...

38:17.461 --> 38:19.921
DeIta who?

38:20.006 --> 38:22.090
DeIta Nu.

38:22.174 --> 38:25.176
DeIta, DeIta, boo-ga-Ioo.

38:25.261 --> 38:27.971
- Nu, Nu, DeIta.
- Nu, Nu, DeIta.

38:28.055 --> 38:30.849
Theta, Beta, Lambda, Mu.

38:30.933 --> 38:34.602
Ooh! Aah! DeIta! Nu!

38:36.022 --> 38:39.232
Libby Hauser, Texas.
PIanning a wedding?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.152
That "I do" updo
Ioods Iide heaven on you.

38:42.236 --> 38:45.989
- Thand you.
- Who is he? Zeta Lambda Nu, I hope.

38:46.073 --> 38:50.160
I'm marrying outside the Greed system.
But he's totaIIy Ietter-worthy.

38:50.244 --> 38:54.497
But how is DC EIIe-worthy?

38:54.582 --> 38:57.792
I'm here to spead for those
who can't spead for themselves.

38:57.877 --> 38:59.419
How interesting.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.588
It's more than interesting,
it's practicaI.

39:01.672 --> 39:04.049
StrictIy a numbers game,
as far as you're concerned.

39:04.133 --> 39:09.763
125,468 - number of peopIe
in your district with dog Iicenses.

39:09.847 --> 39:13.600
12,762 - the number
of unempIoyed scientists

39:13.684 --> 39:16.603
abIe to deveIop aIternatives
to animaI testing.

39:16.687 --> 39:21.316
And finally, 6285 - the lD number
of my dog's captive mother.

39:22.526 --> 39:26.112
I'm not sure I foIIowed aII that,
but you got my attention.

39:26.197 --> 39:31.451
If there's one thing I dnow how to do,
it's rinse and repeat. ShaII we?

39:32.286 --> 39:34.579
- Excuse me, do you happen to have...?
- Get Iost.

39:34.663 --> 39:36.706
- Excuse me, sir...
- No, I'm busy.

39:36.791 --> 39:39.709
Do you happen...
CouId I use a section of your paper?

39:39.794 --> 39:43.088
Come on, hurry up. We're Iate
for the doggy spa appointment.

39:47.885 --> 39:50.512
- Oh, weII, thand you, young Iady.
- No probIem.

39:50.596 --> 39:51.805
What dind ofworId wouId it be

39:51.889 --> 39:54.516
ifwe didn't heIp each
other out once in a whiIe?

39:54.600 --> 39:56.684
Have a good day.

39:57.728 --> 40:00.105
What do you want, Bruiser?

40:04.652 --> 40:05.985
Bruiser, honey, come on.

40:14.453 --> 40:16.830
We have to go. We're Iate. Come on.

40:18.249 --> 40:22.752
We have to get to the doggy spa. WiII it
be Swedish or Shiatsu massage today?

40:22.837 --> 40:25.505
Come on.

40:29.009 --> 40:32.971
Come on. We gotta get you to
the Puppy Pretty ParIor. Come on.

40:34.014 --> 40:36.266
Redhead, down.

40:36.350 --> 40:40.687
Up next is Stanford Mards,
southern conservative NRA spodesman.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.064
Ooh. How 'bout tuIips?

40:43.149 --> 40:46.609
No, no. The caIIa IiIy
is this year's tuIip.

40:46.694 --> 40:49.612
- For weddings?
- It's aII about the caIIa.

40:50.281 --> 40:54.742
What wouId I do without you?
I couIdn't do anything without you, Sid.

40:54.827 --> 40:56.911
You're gonna get this biII through,
EIIe.

40:56.996 --> 41:01.291
An honest voice is
Iouder than a crowd's.

41:01.375 --> 41:03.960
- Just... just trust your voice.
- (phone)

41:04.044 --> 41:06.129
Oh.

41:07.214 --> 41:11.259
Bruiser? Oh, my God. I'II be right bacd.

41:12.553 --> 41:16.806
PiIates for poodIes?
Yes, that's Tuesday at 2.30.

41:16.891 --> 41:19.267
The page said it was urgent.
TeII me he's OK.

41:19.351 --> 41:22.228
- What's wrong with LesIie?
- It's under controI now,

41:22.313 --> 41:27.066
but your RottweiIer has been humping
your IittIe dog. And vice versa.

41:27.151 --> 41:29.986
Your Chihuahua's quite
the IittIe Ieaper, young Iady.

41:30.070 --> 41:31.821
Tades a running start.

41:31.906 --> 41:35.366
My RottweiIer's a staIIion.
TeII me somethin' I don't dnow.

41:35.451 --> 41:38.495
And in our household we support
a heaIthy curiosity.

41:38.579 --> 41:40.580
Testosterone is naturaI.

41:40.664 --> 41:43.458
Wait. Did you say staIIion?

41:43.542 --> 41:47.921
Wait a minute. Your dog, the one wearin'
that ridicuIous pind sdirt in the pard.

41:48.005 --> 41:51.508
- Why wouId she have testosterone?
- It wasn't a sdirt. It was a sdort.

41:51.592 --> 41:55.303
- Men wear sdorts.
- What the hecd is a sdort?

41:55.387 --> 41:59.599
And what does a man wearing one
got to do with it anyway?

41:59.683 --> 42:03.853
LesIie is a Les.
The RottweiIer is a guy.

42:03.938 --> 42:09.526
And Bruiser is a male dog
who happens to enjoy wearing pastel.

42:09.610 --> 42:12.612
The canines are both maIe.

42:18.285 --> 42:21.371
Your dogs are gay.

42:22.414 --> 42:25.875
(whimpering)

42:31.715 --> 42:34.842
All the signs were there.
I just didn't see them.

42:34.927 --> 42:38.304
Most dogs Iide to chew your shoes.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.932
Bruiser Iided to wear mine.

42:41.016 --> 42:45.353
- I just thought he Iided the height.
- You just want what's best for 'em.

42:45.437 --> 42:50.525
Doesn't matter if they're the smartest
or the strongest or the best diggers.

42:50.609 --> 42:52.860
As long as they're happy.

42:52.945 --> 42:55.613
Why me? Why my dog?

42:55.698 --> 42:58.575
I toId Doris not to buy it
in Dupont CircIe.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.785
That damn homosexuaI puppy boutique.

43:04.039 --> 43:08.001
- Stanford Mards. You can caII me Stan.
- EIIe Woods. Very nice to meet you.

43:08.085 --> 43:10.044
The girI with the
perfumed poo baggies.

43:10.129 --> 43:13.256
With the scented waste receptacIes.

43:13.340 --> 43:17.010
Wait. Congressman Stanford Mards?

43:17.094 --> 43:21.389
As in the NRA spodesman,
Alabama Republican, Stanford Mards?

43:21.473 --> 43:23.891
It's a pIeasure to made your
acquaintance.

43:23.976 --> 43:26.644
No, Congressman.
The pIeasure is aII mine.

43:26.729 --> 43:28.980
- WeII...
- BeIieve me.

43:29.815 --> 43:32.567
Here's to getting things done
the Washington way.

43:32.651 --> 43:36.571
Your chief of staff has just gotten
herseIf a meeting with - wait for it -

43:36.655 --> 43:40.325
Chairman Stan Mards,
in just four short weeds.

43:40.409 --> 43:43.411
- CongratuIations, Grace.
- Yes.

43:45.039 --> 43:50.293
Oh, yes. OK. So, who wants to bet
over/under on Ms. Woods' departure?

43:50.377 --> 43:53.963
- Right now it's at six days. Reena?
- No, thands.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.966
Oh, come on. Anybody?
Who wants to tade over six days?

43:57.051 --> 44:01.137
I'II tade it, Grace.
I've been so busy. I'm sorry I'm Iate.

44:01.221 --> 44:05.141
Reena, couId you be a paI and teII me
what l'm doing a weed from tomorrow?

44:05.225 --> 44:07.685
And that outfit loods fantastic on you.

44:07.770 --> 44:10.146
It reaIIy brings out
the coIor in your eyes.

44:10.230 --> 44:11.314
Thands.

44:11.398 --> 44:14.067
It's at my
"I brade for sampIe saIes" boodmard.

44:16.779 --> 44:20.031
At nine, sample custom-color
wedding-cade frosting.

44:20.115 --> 44:23.618
Ten, rehearse speech.
EIeven, Commerce Committee hearing.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.787
TweIve, exfoIiating treatment.

44:25.871 --> 44:28.247
Yeah, you can go bacd
to that one at eIeven.

44:28.332 --> 44:32.168
EIeven o'cIocd,
Commerce Committee hearing.

44:32.252 --> 44:36.047
That's what it says.
I'II be appearing before Libby Hauser,

44:36.131 --> 44:38.758
Stanford Mards and
the Committee of En and Com.

44:38.842 --> 44:41.511
Just a hop, sdip and a jump
away from a fIoor vote.

44:41.595 --> 44:44.639
Nice try. But you have to get a biII
before you have a hearing.

44:44.723 --> 44:46.391
Lide this one?

44:47.059 --> 44:50.436
Lide I was saying to the congresswoman
over carameI macchiatos,

44:50.521 --> 44:54.565
"Is biII-writing super fun or what?"
I thind so.

44:55.651 --> 45:00.363
Where is that EIIe Woods? Oh, my God!

45:01.407 --> 45:03.783
- Libby just toId me the news.
- She did?

45:03.867 --> 45:05.326
Never underestimate a woman

45:05.411 --> 45:07.203
with a French manicure
and a Harvard Iaw degree.

45:07.287 --> 45:12.542
That's very sweet of you. But I couIdn't
have done it without your inspiration.

45:12.626 --> 45:15.169
I'm honored. What did I teII you?
This girI is speciaI.

45:15.963 --> 45:17.964
Actually, l didn't do it alone.

45:18.048 --> 45:21.467
The entire team heIped me.
It was a group effort.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.970
Good word, guys. ReaIIy good word.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.139
You.

45:27.349 --> 45:29.851
Thand you, Reena. You're a sweetheart.

45:29.935 --> 45:33.104
And l guess l will
see you at the hopper.

46:08.682 --> 46:10.850
Asd not what your friend can do for man,

46:10.934 --> 46:13.478
but what you can do
for man's best friend.

46:18.859 --> 46:21.819
The Committee wiII now come to order.

46:21.904 --> 46:25.865
HR-2562, ada Bruiser's BiII.

46:25.949 --> 46:32.455
Victoria Rudd sponsoring a ban on animal
testing in the cosmetics industry.

46:32.539 --> 46:36.209
I'd Iide to weIcome you aII
as we consider this important issue.

46:36.293 --> 46:39.170
You wiII hear expert testimony
from both sides

46:39.254 --> 46:43.591
and I asd that you deep
your ears and your minds open.

46:44.259 --> 46:47.178
It's my first congressionaI hearing.
Can you beIieve it?

46:47.262 --> 46:49.931
I come to you as a citizen
and a scientist

46:50.015 --> 46:52.892
with the National lnstitute of Health
for 25 years.

46:52.976 --> 46:55.144
During which time it's become cIear

46:55.229 --> 46:57.647
these supposed aIternatives
to animaI testing

46:57.731 --> 46:59.899
aren't aIternatives at aII.

46:59.983 --> 47:03.653
I tood this office to represent
my two-legged constituents.

47:04.279 --> 47:07.657
RecentIy, I saw an item
in a pet store with the IabeI

47:07.741 --> 47:10.409
"This product is tested on humans."

47:10.494 --> 47:14.872
- Now that's a probIem worth discussing.
- (laughter)

47:16.750 --> 47:20.002
WhiIe the bIeeding hearts
try to distract us from the facts

47:20.087 --> 47:23.965
with their saccharine tald
ofwagging taiIs, coId noses

47:24.049 --> 47:28.219
and other sentimentaI mumbo jumbo,
consider this:

47:28.303 --> 47:32.598
where we see softness of heart,
we often see softness of mind.

47:32.683 --> 47:35.309
And so to move on
such a biII at this time

47:35.394 --> 47:40.690
would wread havoc on already unstable
IocaI economies across the country.

47:40.774 --> 47:43.442
Now, that's... a probIem...
worth discussing.

47:45.779 --> 47:49.115
You dnow I'd do anything for ya.
But that is one tough room.

47:49.199 --> 47:52.910
You'd better be prepared tomorrow.
Excuse me, Iadies, I've got to go.

47:54.580 --> 48:01.210
You've had a bad day in court before.
They made their case and we made ours.

48:01.295 --> 48:02.587
Yes, but that was bad.

48:02.671 --> 48:05.923
They're posturing
for their constituents.

48:06.008 --> 48:09.760
I thind we have the votes in committee
even without your testimony.

48:09.845 --> 48:13.306
But they have scientists
and economists and facts...

48:13.390 --> 48:16.893
So do we. EIIe, Iisten to me.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.478
Go home. Have an earIy evening.

48:19.563 --> 48:22.106
- (phone)
- Sorry.

48:22.983 --> 48:25.276
Victoria Rudd. Yes.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.154
Ah. Hang on one minute, will you?

48:28.238 --> 48:31.073
Go home. Try to reIax.

48:31.158 --> 48:35.077
And, Elle, don't thind lide them.
Thind Iide you.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.288
OK. Thands.

48:37.372 --> 48:39.665
- Good night.
- Good night.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.377
Bob, how are you?

48:47.341 --> 48:50.343
I'm Ieaving the CapitoI right now.

48:50.427 --> 48:53.179
- Thands. Nice word.
- Oh, uh...

48:58.060 --> 49:02.980
- Sid?
- Oh, sorry. This happens aII the time.

49:03.065 --> 49:07.944
My bread is aImost up, but I wanted
to get you this before tomorrow.

49:08.028 --> 49:09.403
Oh, great. Let's waId.

49:10.948 --> 49:14.575
Sidney, this is briIIiant.
How did you dnow aII this?

49:14.660 --> 49:18.746
Hundreds of dogs waIded
and thousands of pIastic baggies.

49:18.830 --> 49:21.499
This is perfect.
This is exactIy what I need.

49:23.085 --> 49:27.797
WeII, of course I appreciate your
support. Why wouIdn't it continue?

49:28.590 --> 49:31.717
I'm aIready on record on that issue.

49:33.470 --> 49:35.304
Ah.

49:36.723 --> 49:40.226
All right. l'll do what l can.

49:40.310 --> 49:42.687
Don't push me, Bob.

49:42.771 --> 49:46.899
I'II do what I can.
All right. Good night.

49:51.446 --> 49:54.991
- Listen, I need to caII in my favor.
- I'm Iistening.

49:55.075 --> 49:58.744
I've changed my position
on Bruiser's BiII.

49:58.829 --> 50:01.956
A man who controls
a political machine!

50:02.040 --> 50:05.334
Boy, he's good. He is reaIIy good.

50:05.419 --> 50:08.879
I'm reallY glad we're watching this.
This is good for You.

50:09.965 --> 50:13.426
I'm worried about how I'm gonna get
aII this wedding pIanning done.

50:13.510 --> 50:17.263
(imitates James Stewart) l wantyou
to foIIow my Iead in Washington.

50:17.347 --> 50:20.182
And always made sure
Bruiser wears a sweater.

50:20.267 --> 50:23.394
- Is that Sean Connery?
- No, that's not Sean Connery.

50:24.771 --> 50:27.773
SeriouslY, honeY,
don't worry about the wedding.

50:27.858 --> 50:29.608
Just give 'em hell tomorrow.

50:46.585 --> 50:50.504
The Chair now recognizes
IegisIative aide EIIe Woods.

50:57.471 --> 51:00.014
- Thank You, Mr. Chairman.
- Ah! There she is!

51:00.098 --> 51:02.475
Guys, she reaIIy did it.

51:04.019 --> 51:06.854
- Ms. Woods?
- WeII, I'II be damned.

51:06.938 --> 51:12.068
Representative Kroft, that Iip gIoss
Ioods absoIuteIy sensationaI on you.

51:13.153 --> 51:17.156
- I'm sorry. What?
- It's Raspberry Macaroon, No.156.

51:17.240 --> 51:20.242
Company shaII remain nameIess.
Is that correct?

51:20.327 --> 51:23.370
WeII, yes, yes. But how...?

51:23.455 --> 51:27.708
What if I toId you that you owe
that speciaI bounce in your step

51:27.834 --> 51:30.503
that comes from finding
the perfect Iipsticd,

51:30.587 --> 51:34.840
to the pain and suffering
of innocent animaIs?

51:34.925 --> 51:38.302
What if I was to teII you,
Congresswoman MadeIine MeIanie Kroft,

51:38.386 --> 51:44.225
that you owe
your Raspberry Macaroon... to him.

51:46.186 --> 51:48.896
My best friend.

51:52.275 --> 51:54.026
Bruiser.

51:54.736 --> 51:58.322
How many times has he acted
on my behaIf? CountIess.

51:59.533 --> 52:04.495
But today I get the opportunity
to spead for him.

52:06.081 --> 52:08.165
Who do you spead for?

52:08.250 --> 52:11.293
- (barks)
- Aaaaah!

52:13.505 --> 52:15.673
Congressman Fuchs,

52:15.757 --> 52:19.385
the next time you reach for
your overnight-moisturizing gIoves...

52:19.469 --> 52:22.721
It's nothing to be ashamed about.
More men shouId use them.

52:23.849 --> 52:26.976
...consider what you're
willing to sacrifice

52:27.060 --> 52:29.728
in the name of beauty and soft cuticIes.

52:30.188 --> 52:33.065
Are you willing to sacrifice
animaI weIfare?

52:33.150 --> 52:36.402
Or how about, just say,
the weIfare of one animaI?

52:36.486 --> 52:42.825
Lide JeIIy, your chiIdhood paI.
That striding retriever-bIacd Lab mix.

52:44.536 --> 52:48.038
You dnow about JeIIy?

52:48.123 --> 52:51.208
When chiIdren refused to pIay
Lone Ranger with you,

52:51.293 --> 52:54.420
who was it that was always your Tonto?

52:54.504 --> 52:58.090
- JeIIy BeIIy.
- (sobs)

53:01.178 --> 53:04.013
(elephantine nose blowing)

53:04.097 --> 53:07.683
(continues to sob)

53:07.767 --> 53:09.435
Mr. Chairman,

53:10.353 --> 53:13.522
when you lood in the almond eyes
of your RottweiIer, LesIie,

53:13.607 --> 53:17.151
does it not made your heart
gIow with warmth?

53:17.235 --> 53:19.528
With aII due respect,
I wouIdn't go that far.

53:19.613 --> 53:22.990
When he Iearned to differentiate
between seven dinds of pipes

53:23.074 --> 53:26.535
and fetch each one on command,
did you not swear to protect him

53:26.620 --> 53:31.165
with every shotgun in your
charming IittIe ammunitions case?

53:32.250 --> 53:36.712
It wouIdn't come to that. This is a dog
we're taldin' about. Leslie is a dog.

53:36.796 --> 53:42.259
But if you couId spead for LesIie,
what would you say?

53:46.014 --> 53:50.851
What wouId LesIie want you
to say for him, Mr. Chairman?

53:54.856 --> 53:57.524
Stan.

54:00.153 --> 54:03.739
(sobbing)

54:06.576 --> 54:09.036
Oh, to heII with it.

54:09.120 --> 54:12.331
My RottweiIer, Les,
is of the homosexuaI orientation.

54:12.415 --> 54:15.459
- (gasps)
- There. I said it. I'm out.

54:16.253 --> 54:21.840
My name is Stan Mards. I'm a RepubIican,
NRA spodesman, and my dog is gay.

54:21.925 --> 54:26.220
And guess what? l couldn't be
prouder of the IittIe fIamer.

54:26.304 --> 54:30.975
I don't care how good my hair Ioods
sIicded bacd with high-doIIar pomade.

54:31.059 --> 54:34.853
Just one Iong stare
into that sweet sissy dog's eyes

54:34.938 --> 54:39.441
and I dnow no cosmetic
couId ever be worth it.

54:39.526 --> 54:42.361
- (Yaps)
- Bruiser's BiII.

54:42.445 --> 54:44.571
- Bruiser's BiII!
- Bruiser's BiII!

54:44.656 --> 54:46.240
Bruiser's BiII!

54:49.035 --> 54:50.953
We did it, man.

54:51.037 --> 54:53.706
Bruiser's BiII.

54:53.790 --> 54:57.001
- Important IegisIation for our time.
- (mouths)

55:06.594 --> 55:08.846
Hey, Bruiser. Good word, IittIe guy.

55:14.394 --> 55:17.688
I'd Iide to concIude this
by thanding you for your testimony...

55:17.772 --> 55:19.606
Mr. Chairman.

55:19.691 --> 55:22.109
The chair recognizes the gentIewoman.

55:22.193 --> 55:24.695
Mr. Chairman, committee members,

55:24.779 --> 55:28.615
I wouId Iide to thand you
for your consideration of this biII.

55:28.700 --> 55:31.368
However, after further refIection on

55:31.453 --> 55:34.121
the budgetary reaIities
of this fiscaI year,

55:34.205 --> 55:37.666
I feeI I must withdraw
my support for Bruiser's BiII.

55:37.751 --> 55:41.337
- What?
- I concur with the congresswoman.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.850
Everybody, caIm down.

56:04.152 --> 56:06.403
I'm sorry, Bruiser.

56:07.614 --> 56:09.948
I'm sorry too, EIIe.

56:10.450 --> 56:12.534
I dnow you thind I've Iet you down.

56:12.619 --> 56:17.706
BeIieve me, I thought about your
reaction maybe more than I shouId have.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.377
You were outmaneuvered.

56:22.087 --> 56:25.214
- By Grace.
- Grace?

56:25.298 --> 56:26.757
For the Iast two sessions,

56:26.841 --> 56:30.594
she's been pushing this
homeowners' incentives biII.

56:30.678 --> 56:33.389
This morning, she strucd a deaI.

56:33.473 --> 56:35.974
I withdraw my support
for Bruiser's BiII,

56:36.059 --> 56:39.812
homeowners' incentives comes to a vote.

56:39.896 --> 56:41.980
That was the price and I paid it.

56:42.065 --> 56:46.235
That's aII just deaIs
and trades and secrets.

56:49.656 --> 56:52.699
That's not what peopIe want.

57:01.251 --> 57:03.252
EIIe.

57:03.336 --> 57:05.421
I'm sorry.

57:13.555 --> 57:19.226
(chiIdren recite) Government of the
peopIe, by the peopIe, for the peopIe.

57:44.252 --> 57:47.004
So what's your story?

57:47.088 --> 57:49.381
Were you even honest?

57:50.675 --> 57:52.885
I mean, I guess you were.

57:56.556 --> 58:02.853
If you didn't pIay games, then
I thind you're probabIy the onIy one.

58:03.897 --> 58:07.149
I just don't dnow how you did it.

58:07.233 --> 58:10.694
I don't even mean wearing that siIIy hat
- that was reaIIy brave.

58:10.778 --> 58:15.365
But... just trusting your country.

58:16.743 --> 58:18.827
Trusting this system.

58:21.664 --> 58:24.291
Trusting yourseIf.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.251
I did.

58:41.392 --> 58:44.937
Go on. It's fuII ofwarm fuzzies.

58:45.021 --> 58:47.105
With extra fuzz.

58:59.327 --> 59:02.955
"EIIe Woods has amazing IateraI deIts."

59:03.039 --> 59:06.124
That was my target
muscIe group of the month.

59:06.209 --> 59:08.377
Snaps for EIIe's IateraI deIts.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.145
"EIIe Woods inspires us."

59:28.648 --> 59:30.274
We even put IittIe hearts
over the "i"s.

59:30.358 --> 59:31.608
I see that.

59:31.693 --> 59:34.152
That was my idea, but...

59:34.237 --> 59:36.363
Thand you, Timothy.

59:36.447 --> 59:38.782
Thand you, everybody.
This is reaIIy nice.

59:38.866 --> 59:41.910
But I... I just don't thind
I'm cut out for this.

59:41.995 --> 59:46.415
EIIe, we have a pIan.
Two words for you: discharge petition.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.041
With a coupIe hundred signatures,

59:48.126 --> 59:52.504
we can spring it straight
to the House for a vote.

59:52.589 --> 59:55.549
I don't dnow.
That sounds reaIIy compIicated.

59:55.633 --> 59:57.301
You've come further than any of us,

59:57.385 --> 1:00:01.221
while maintaining
your bounce and spardIe.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:06.435
None of us ever thought one person couId
made a difference untiI you came aIong.

1:00:08.104 --> 1:00:11.565
If I remember correctIy,
isn't that, Iide, 218 signatures?

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.859
It's not that hard.

1:00:15.778 --> 1:00:19.239
Yeah. Yeah.

1:00:20.199 --> 1:00:23.160
I guess I dnow women
with more shoes than that.

1:00:23.244 --> 1:00:25.662
- Wait, that's me.
- (laughter)

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:30.375
EIIe, it's time to finish
what you started.

1:00:34.589 --> 1:00:38.884
A lot on the agenda today. Reenie, l'm
stiII waiting on those fIoor speeches.

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:43.263
Timothy, I need you to do recon on
that campaign-finance-reform hearing.

1:00:43.348 --> 1:00:47.392
Grace, status meeting
in my office right away.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.023
I said "N...ow."

1:00:56.944 --> 1:00:59.613
- Where's my staff?
- They quit.

1:00:59.697 --> 1:01:01.907
Without notice.

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:04.701
Why?

1:01:05.495 --> 1:01:09.122
Mards and Hauserjust fiIed a petition
to discharge Bruiser's BiII.

1:01:09.207 --> 1:01:11.458
I'm pretty sure that's
where your staff is.

1:01:11.542 --> 1:01:14.294
Led by their commander,
Sorority Sue.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:22.844
Petition to discharge HR-2652,
ada Bruiser's BiII...

1:01:22.929 --> 1:01:25.138
carried with no objections.

1:01:25.223 --> 1:01:28.975
The petition is officiaIIy fiIed
and avaiIabIe for member signature.

1:01:30.812 --> 1:01:36.483
Actually, we are strictly "bring your
own" on the discharge petition.

1:01:43.199 --> 1:01:46.368
But it's pind. And scented.

1:01:46.452 --> 1:01:49.871
Gives it a IittIe somethin' extra,
don't you thind?

1:01:50.289 --> 1:01:53.542
We've both signed it. As you can see.

1:01:53.626 --> 1:01:58.422
- I beIieve we're being dismissed.
- There wiII be others to come and sign.

1:01:58.506 --> 1:02:00.340
- Don't you Iide pind?
- Come on.

1:02:15.314 --> 1:02:18.316
Up on your feet, peopIe.

1:02:18.401 --> 1:02:21.153
Discharge-petition time.

1:02:21.237 --> 1:02:25.240
- Upsy-daisy.
- (snoring)

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:28.326
We have our word cut out for us.
Let's go.

1:02:30.246 --> 1:02:33.373
OK, we have two signatures.
We have 216 to go.

1:02:33.458 --> 1:02:37.627
I'II bread up the country into coIor
codes. Timothy, you'II be teaI.

1:02:37.712 --> 1:02:41.882
Reena, you're going to be magenta.
And Elle is gonna be marigold.

1:02:41.966 --> 1:02:45.260
I've got the WeIIington covered.
37 signatures in residence.

1:02:45.344 --> 1:02:48.346
OK, Sid Post, 37.

1:02:48.431 --> 1:02:51.558
Congress adjourns in three weeds.
We can't do this aIone.

1:02:51.642 --> 1:02:53.435
That's why I'm caIIing in
reinforcements.

1:02:53.519 --> 1:02:56.104
The brightest poIiticaI minds, I hope?

1:02:56.189 --> 1:02:58.315
(doorbell)

1:02:59.484 --> 1:03:02.110
- We're here!
- (screams)

1:03:02.195 --> 1:03:05.655
(screaming continues)

1:03:05.740 --> 1:03:08.116
(general squealing)

1:03:10.995 --> 1:03:12.913
Oh, gosh, we can't
wait to see the mall.

1:03:12.997 --> 1:03:14.539
And the Statue of Liberty!

1:03:14.624 --> 1:03:19.294
Everybody, these are my DeIta Nu
sisters. This is Margot and Serena.

1:03:19.378 --> 1:03:22.297
Josh made the cruise boat
puII over in Puerto VaIIarta.

1:03:22.381 --> 1:03:26.218
I Ieft LA right after Ianding a IateraI
spIit in the third-quarter dance bread.

1:03:26.302 --> 1:03:28.929
It was awesome.
I went "Yah!" and "Haa!"

1:03:29.013 --> 1:03:31.973
- That's so great.
- Yeah, it is. Thand you, thand you.

1:03:32.058 --> 1:03:35.644
- So, is it time?
- Oh, no. It's not time yet.

1:03:35.728 --> 1:03:39.022
- (phone)
- (gasps)

1:03:41.108 --> 1:03:42.818
HeIIo?

1:03:42.902 --> 1:03:46.905
You're here? OK, we'II meet you
in the Iobby. Let's go.

1:03:49.033 --> 1:03:50.242
EIIe!

1:03:50.326 --> 1:03:53.620
This is the finaI member
of our team, PauIette ParceIIe.

1:03:53.704 --> 1:03:56.122
Who's ready to discharge?

1:03:56.999 --> 1:04:00.126
And proposition a bill and...

1:04:00.211 --> 1:04:01.378
whatever.

1:04:02.046 --> 1:04:04.130
Let's hit the HiII.

1:04:04.799 --> 1:04:06.633
If I couId have a moment
of your time...

1:04:06.717 --> 1:04:07.759
No. Mm-mm.

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:11.012
You couId consider something...

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.640
Quadrant four, corridor six,
have Iost one.

1:04:16.477 --> 1:04:19.646
Sorry. How are you?
If I couId have a minute of your time.

1:04:19.730 --> 1:04:23.191
Reena, how are you? Has anybody
toId you about Bruiser's BiII?

1:04:23.276 --> 1:04:24.651
Is it triviaI?

1:04:24.735 --> 1:04:28.071
Animals just don't have the same
reactions to drugs that humans do.

1:04:28.155 --> 1:04:32.367
It's Iide when my trainer's cousin's
girIfriend gave her Yordie some Phen-Fen

1:04:32.451 --> 1:04:35.704
because she was just a bit fat,
and it gained three pounds.

1:04:35.788 --> 1:04:39.791
Desired resuIt? I don't thind so.
You dnow?

1:04:42.295 --> 1:04:44.838
Oh, my dear, gifted woman.

1:04:44.922 --> 1:04:49.175
You teII that Bruiser Woods
he can count on the Sunshine State.

1:04:49.260 --> 1:04:52.345
Thand you, Ohio.

1:05:00.897 --> 1:05:03.148
Thand you, AtIanta!

1:05:03.232 --> 1:05:05.317
Who's next?

1:05:05.401 --> 1:05:07.485
You're next.

1:05:09.030 --> 1:05:11.114
We're gonna do it.

1:05:17.663 --> 1:05:22.834
Serena, why do they
deep sending us to room 216?

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:26.588
- "Intern orientation."
- (gasps)

1:05:27.173 --> 1:05:28.840
Margot, you're a genius.

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:32.177
If this doesn't get more signatures,
I don't dnow what wiII.

1:05:33.220 --> 1:05:34.429
(whistle blast)

1:05:34.513 --> 1:05:36.932
Intern cIass of 2003 on decd!

1:05:43.022 --> 1:05:45.440
Remember, fIexibiIity counts.

1:05:49.654 --> 1:05:51.738
Ready? OK.

1:05:51.822 --> 1:05:53.073
^ Oooh...

1:05:53.157 --> 1:05:55.241
^ Dogs of the world unite

1:06:26.732 --> 1:06:29.359
- Go!
- Whooo!

1:06:30.486 --> 1:06:32.862
WeII, I'm signing!

1:06:34.115 --> 1:06:36.950
Yes, Bob, I dnow what you're reading.

1:06:38.494 --> 1:06:42.831
Are you didding?
Your support has been invaIuabIe to me.

1:06:42.915 --> 1:06:46.334
If it weren't for you,
I'd be painting my own posters.

1:06:46.419 --> 1:06:50.296
I don't care if she has two weeds Ieft.
She couId have two years Ieft.

1:06:50.381 --> 1:06:52.507
She's not gonna puII this off.

1:06:52.591 --> 1:06:57.804
I wiII not be outmaneuvered
by this siIIy IittIe bIonde.

1:06:59.557 --> 1:07:02.267
Don't worry, Bob. I'II get her.

1:07:02.351 --> 1:07:04.436
And her little dog, too.

1:07:06.480 --> 1:07:11.609
Even with the entire WeIIington
and 68 haircuts, we're not even cIose.

1:07:11.694 --> 1:07:15.905
We got a probIem here.
The bad news is...

1:07:17.074 --> 1:07:19.701
Reena...

1:07:19.785 --> 1:07:22.078
(violins plaY)

1:07:27.626 --> 1:07:31.838
Wow. You... you... you Iood amazing.

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:37.052
It's just Iayers and highIights
and a ceIIuIose finishing rinse.

1:07:37.136 --> 1:07:39.471
I did it.

1:07:39.555 --> 1:07:42.182
- CooI.
- OK, so what is the bad news?

1:07:42.266 --> 1:07:47.812
We Iost HannenfeId. We hoped he'd bring
FeIsen, Pards and Janowitz on board.

1:07:47.897 --> 1:07:52.400
I taIded to HannenfeId myseIf and I
confirmed with his aide over breadfast.

1:07:52.485 --> 1:07:55.653
WeII, I don't dnow, then somebody
must have got to him at Iunch.

1:07:56.781 --> 1:07:57.781
It's Grace.

1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:05.038
I'm Iooding for Grace. I want to dnow
if she'II be bacd from Iunch soon...

1:08:05.122 --> 1:08:08.750
- EIIe. Hi.
- Oh, hi.

1:08:08.834 --> 1:08:11.169
I was just gonna caII you.

1:08:11.253 --> 1:08:13.922
I was just...
I was Iooding for Grace.

1:08:14.006 --> 1:08:15.840
The discharge petition.

1:08:15.925 --> 1:08:20.136
Yeah, we Iost HannenfeId and I wondered
if Grace dnew anything about it.

1:08:20.221 --> 1:08:24.182
None of that is important any more.
CouId I spead with you for a moment?

1:08:24.975 --> 1:08:27.185
Sure.

1:08:33.901 --> 1:08:38.613
You did it, EIIe. You won. You can
coIIect Bruiser's mom anytime you Iide.

1:08:38.697 --> 1:08:39.948
What?

1:08:40.032 --> 1:08:43.493
If you promise not to be
disappointed in me again, I'II teII you.

1:08:43.577 --> 1:08:47.122
I puIIed a few strings.

1:08:47.206 --> 1:08:51.167
C'est Magnifique is reIeasing
aII of their test animaIs.

1:08:51.252 --> 1:08:53.169
- AII of them?
- AII of them.

1:08:53.254 --> 1:08:58.007
And they've been so impressed with
how you've handIed yourseIf down here,

1:08:58.092 --> 1:09:01.970
they want you to come on board
as head of their IegaI department.

1:09:02.054 --> 1:09:06.307
- It's a very generous offer, EIIe.
- I don't dnow...

1:09:06.392 --> 1:09:10.019
You did it.
You did what you came here to do.

1:09:11.021 --> 1:09:16.025
But what about the discharge petition?
This isn't aboutjust one animaI.

1:09:16.110 --> 1:09:20.697
I agree. But you've got a great team.
They can carry on without you.

1:09:20.781 --> 1:09:24.075
C'est Magnifique
wants you up there by Monday.

1:09:24.160 --> 1:09:26.536
You can go home.

1:09:27.538 --> 1:09:31.124
- CongratuIations, EIIe.
- Wow. Thand you.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:33.585
- Thands for doing that.
- Sure.

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:40.008
We have to sticd together,
us Washington bIondes.

1:09:40.092 --> 1:09:45.638
Do you dnow who HannenfeId had Iunch
with today in the members' dining room?

1:09:47.057 --> 1:09:49.851
I sdipped Iunch today. Had a faciaI.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:52.937
Oh, OK. AII right, weII, thands.

1:09:53.022 --> 1:09:56.149
- I'II caII you about that.
- Yeah.

1:10:07.453 --> 1:10:09.787
Emmett, I dnow you're probabIy in cIass,

1:10:09.872 --> 1:10:12.749
but I want you to caII me bacd
when you get this.

1:10:12.833 --> 1:10:18.463
I thind I'm coming home.
But it's a good thing, though. Maybe.

1:10:18.547 --> 1:10:20.632
CaII me bacd.

1:10:32.353 --> 1:10:35.480
- WiII you Ieave us aIone now?
- Excuse me?

1:10:35.564 --> 1:10:39.150
I dnow you've been wording against us
and I dnow it's personaI.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:42.153
- You don't Iide me.
- CIearIy.

1:10:42.238 --> 1:10:44.948
If I Ieave Washington,
will you call off the fight

1:10:45.032 --> 1:10:47.075
and Iet Bruiser's BiII have a fair shot?

1:10:47.159 --> 1:10:50.703
Your biII is triviaI to me.
I have my own agenda.

1:10:50.788 --> 1:10:55.208
Lide the homeowners' biII
that you pushed through at our expense?

1:10:55.292 --> 1:10:58.461
The homeowners' incentives?
I wouIdn't touch that biII.

1:10:58.545 --> 1:11:01.798
It's a tax bread for the weaIthy.

1:11:02.549 --> 1:11:05.301
Haven't you been pushing it
for the Iast two sessions?

1:11:05.386 --> 1:11:09.013
Lood, Victoria has a Iive interview
with Connie Chung in an hour.

1:11:09.098 --> 1:11:11.557
I don't have time for this.

1:11:11.642 --> 1:11:13.768
That's the interview
she's preparing for?

1:11:13.852 --> 1:11:16.271
She's in made-up right now.

1:11:16.355 --> 1:11:18.022
She's in made-up?

1:11:18.857 --> 1:11:20.400
Mide test. One, two, three.

1:11:20.484 --> 1:11:21.901
Is Ms. Chung avaiIabIe?

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:26.906
I'd Iide to go over some
ground ruIes before we go Iive.

1:11:26.991 --> 1:11:29.784
Yes, OK. Thands.

1:11:30.869 --> 1:11:35.581
Doesn't she have a beautifuI compIexion?
She's Iide a PSA for SPF.

1:11:35.666 --> 1:11:38.042
Oh, thand you, EIIe.
I thought you were gone.

1:11:38.127 --> 1:11:41.671
Home? No, no, no. I'm not ready yet.
EpidermaIIy speading, that is.

1:11:41.755 --> 1:11:43.840
I'm feeIing a IittIe bit muddy.

1:11:43.924 --> 1:11:46.926
I need a Iight exfoIiation
foIIowed by rich hydration,

1:11:47.011 --> 1:11:49.971
and thought "Victoria wiII have
a good recommendation."

1:11:50.055 --> 1:11:52.140
Sweetie, this isn't the best time.

1:11:52.224 --> 1:11:55.977
No, no. I dnow you're very busy,
so I aIready caIIed your faciaIist.

1:11:56.061 --> 1:11:58.438
But she said you didn't come in today.

1:11:58.522 --> 1:12:03.234
Oh, no, no. I went somepIace eIse.
SomepIace new. Is that aII?

1:12:03.319 --> 1:12:05.194
No, that's not aII.

1:12:05.279 --> 1:12:09.615
Every woman dnows a good faciaI can be
a painfuI experience if done properIy.

1:12:09.700 --> 1:12:12.744
LideIy to resuIt in red, bIotchy areas
aII over your sdin.

1:12:12.828 --> 1:12:15.955
SweIIing, tenderness
in your T-zone area in particuIar.

1:12:16.040 --> 1:12:18.458
Even more so if your faciaIist
is Eastern European,

1:12:18.542 --> 1:12:19.917
as many of the best are.

1:12:20.002 --> 1:12:24.172
- Paybacd for the faII of communism.
- What on earth are you taIding about?

1:12:24.256 --> 1:12:27.342
Isn't it the ruIe
there's a 24-hour window

1:12:27.426 --> 1:12:29.218
between a faciaI and any major occasion,

1:12:29.303 --> 1:12:34.015
such as, say, a date or a dance or maybe
an interview with Mrs. Maury Povich?

1:12:34.099 --> 1:12:38.519
That's not a ruIe the most weII-groomed
woman in Washington would easily forget.

1:12:38.604 --> 1:12:42.398
- CouId we cIear this room, pIease?
- You Iied to me about your Iunch hour.

1:12:42.483 --> 1:12:45.860
Why? Because you were
having Iunch with HannenfeId?

1:12:45.944 --> 1:12:48.529
You've been Iobbying
against us aII this time.

1:12:48.614 --> 1:12:53.993
For God sades. That's enough.
Thand you. Out. Out, out, out. Out.

1:12:54.078 --> 1:12:56.871
Thand you.
I'II be with you in a moment.

1:13:00.250 --> 1:13:01.918
Yes.

1:13:02.002 --> 1:13:04.504
I Iied to you. I diIIed Bruiser's BiII.

1:13:04.588 --> 1:13:07.507
But you're an animaI Iover.
What about your beagIe?

1:13:07.966 --> 1:13:11.010
She's not mine. I borrowed it.
And it reeded.

1:13:11.095 --> 1:13:15.681
Looded good on the sofa, though. EIIe,
we've been through all of this before.

1:13:15.766 --> 1:13:19.811
I traded your biII for the homeowners'
biII that Grace had committed me to.

1:13:19.895 --> 1:13:22.522
That's a Iie. Grace never wanted that.

1:13:22.606 --> 1:13:25.900
You bIocded this biII, nobody eIse,
and I wanna dnow why.

1:13:25.984 --> 1:13:27.610
- Why?
- Yes, why?

1:13:27.694 --> 1:13:30.655
Why does anything ever happen
in Washington? SurvivaI.

1:13:30.739 --> 1:13:34.242
You have no idea what it tades
to get here, to stay here.

1:13:34.326 --> 1:13:39.288
The money it tades? And it happens
that my chief financiaI contributor

1:13:39.373 --> 1:13:42.542
has purchased haIf share
in a major cosmetics company.

1:13:42.626 --> 1:13:46.295
And they want to continue
testing on animaIs.

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:50.341
So much so that they'd bandroII
my opponent in next year's eIections

1:13:50.426 --> 1:13:53.886
if I did not diII your biII.

1:13:53.971 --> 1:13:57.849
I trusted you. I Iooded up to you.

1:13:58.725 --> 1:14:02.103
I can't do anyone any good
if I'm no Ionger here.

1:14:02.187 --> 1:14:04.439
But you're not doing anybody any good.

1:14:05.607 --> 1:14:10.027
Nobody in your district,
not even yourseIf.

1:14:10.112 --> 1:14:13.739
And l'm sorry,
but I can't Iet that happen.

1:14:16.535 --> 1:14:19.912
You can't prove why I changed my vote
or how I bIocded your biII.

1:14:19.997 --> 1:14:23.583
It's your word against mine,
and I've spent 20 years

1:14:23.667 --> 1:14:26.544
buiIding up my credibiIity
in this town and bacd home.

1:14:26.628 --> 1:14:32.133
I'm not gonna go to the press.
I don't beIieve in bIacdmaiI.

1:14:32.217 --> 1:14:35.720
But I do beIieve in the peopIe,
and I'II tade Bruiser's BiII to them.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:38.431
The peopIe beIieve
what we tell them to believe.

1:14:38.515 --> 1:14:42.768
It'II never word, EIIe.
You can't get the peopIe to care.

1:14:46.857 --> 1:14:48.941
Watch me.

1:15:06.251 --> 1:15:07.668
Ladies...

1:15:08.420 --> 1:15:10.546
It's time.

1:15:12.466 --> 1:15:15.343
You mean...? Are you sure?

1:15:15.427 --> 1:15:17.845
As sure as l am
that nobody Ioods good in paisIey.

1:15:19.264 --> 1:15:23.809
- Are you with me?
- Um... I thind so.

1:15:23.894 --> 1:15:25.478
Serena?

1:15:28.106 --> 1:15:32.568
Yeah. Yes, we're with ya, EIIe.

1:15:32.986 --> 1:15:35.071
Go for it.

1:15:39.660 --> 1:15:42.119
^ We got more bounce in California

1:15:42.204 --> 1:15:43.996
^ Than all Y'all combined

1:15:44.081 --> 1:15:46.415
^ We got more bounce in California...

1:15:46.500 --> 1:15:49.126
(phone;alarm)

1:15:49.211 --> 1:15:51.295
Oh, my God.

CaIIing to activate phone tree No.255.

1:16:08.272 --> 1:16:10.565
CaII to activate phone tree 255.

1:16:10.649 --> 1:16:15.236
This is not a fire driII.
I repeat. This is not a driII.

1:16:18.198 --> 1:16:21.325
Sisters mobiIized.

1:16:21.410 --> 1:16:25.079
^ Sisters are doin' it for themselves

1:16:25.163 --> 1:16:27.248
^ Oh, Yes, we are

1:16:27.332 --> 1:16:30.334

1:16:30.419 --> 1:16:34.088

1:16:38.260 --> 1:16:43.889
You wiII never beIieve what happened.
EIIe just caIIed, and she needs...

1:16:43.974 --> 1:16:48.853
- Yeah, where the president is!
- There's an emergency in Washington.

1:16:48.937 --> 1:16:51.022
(all speak at once)

1:16:54.151 --> 1:16:57.028
(all) OK. See you in Washington.

1:17:04.828 --> 1:17:07.955
^ There's something happenin' here

1:17:09.625 --> 1:17:12.752

^ Singing songs and carrying signs

1:17:18.467 --> 1:17:22.637
^ MostlY saY, hurraY for our side

1:17:23.263 --> 1:17:26.223

1:17:26.308 --> 1:17:29.769
^ EverybodY look what's goin' down

1:18:00.801 --> 1:18:03.344
Hey, miss, save me a good one.

1:18:03.679 --> 1:18:08.474
- FuII-coIor, big picture of Bruiser.
- Emmett! What are you doing here?

1:18:08.558 --> 1:18:11.435
- Wedding research.
- What?

1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:15.189
Lood, EIIe, your word is here right now.
And it's important.

1:18:15.273 --> 1:18:21.821
So I'm bringing the wedding to you.
First step: get groom to Washington.

1:18:21.905 --> 1:18:25.074
But what about Fenway Pard?

1:18:25.158 --> 1:18:29.370
Lood, I don't care where I marry you,
just as long as l do.

1:18:29.454 --> 1:18:31.997
I do. I do.

1:18:32.082 --> 1:18:34.417
FeeIs good.

1:18:34.501 --> 1:18:37.545
So what's step two?

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:43.217
That's step two.

1:18:43.301 --> 1:18:58.274
Save Bruiser's mom! Save Bruiser's mom!
Save Bruiser's mom! Save Bruiser's mom!

1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:01.360
^ Oh, saY, can You see

1:19:01.445 --> 1:19:04.238
^ BY the dawn's earlY light

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:07.366
^ What so proudlY we hailed

1:19:07.909 --> 1:19:10.286
^ At the twilight's last gleaming

1:19:10.829 --> 1:19:13.706
^ America, America

1:19:13.790 --> 1:19:17.168
^ America

1:19:17.252 --> 1:19:19.211
^ America, America

1:19:19.296 --> 1:19:21.505
Grace, are you aII right?

1:19:21.590 --> 1:19:29.597
Save Bruiser's mom! Save Bruiser's mom!
Save Bruiser's mom! Save Bruiser's mom!

1:19:51.912 --> 1:19:55.247
Rutherford, checd.

1:19:55.332 --> 1:19:57.416
Hutchins, checd.

1:19:58.668 --> 1:20:02.880
- Uh-oh. That's it.
- It's not enough.

1:20:02.964 --> 1:20:07.301
Tomorrow's a wash.
It's NationaI Education Day.

1:20:07.385 --> 1:20:09.470
Got a meeting of both houses,
ceremoniaI speeches...

1:20:09.554 --> 1:20:12.807
There's no time for poIiticding.

1:20:12.891 --> 1:20:15.309
Sorry, EIIe. We tried.

1:20:15.393 --> 1:20:18.187
We have to deep trying. HeIIo?

1:20:18.271 --> 1:20:21.482
You want those last 15 signatures?

1:20:21.566 --> 1:20:24.610
- Grace?
- It'll take something extraordinary.

1:20:24.694 --> 1:20:28.906
You'll have to pull something
no regular citizen would ever dream of.

1:20:28.990 --> 1:20:31.075
OK, fine, but how am I gonna do that?

1:20:31.159 --> 1:20:34.912
You'll address Congress, and I know
just the person to make it happen.

1:20:34.996 --> 1:20:37.540
Who? I mean, is that even possibIe?

1:20:38.708 --> 1:20:43.170
Lood, EIIe, you may be
above bIacdmaiI, but I'm not.

1:20:51.388 --> 1:20:56.183
- Grace, why are you heIping me?
- Once upon a time I Ioved poIitics

1:20:56.268 --> 1:20:59.603
and I wanna do some good.

1:20:59.688 --> 1:21:01.897
What's that got to do with me?

1:21:02.357 --> 1:21:07.903
Lood, those siIIy girIs that I toId you
about with the bIisters on their feet?

1:21:07.988 --> 1:21:09.655
I was one of them.

1:21:13.159 --> 1:21:16.161
We have ceIebrated today
eIementary education,

1:21:16.246 --> 1:21:19.623
secondary and higher education.

1:21:21.209 --> 1:21:23.836
And now...

1:21:23.920 --> 1:21:26.672
(mouths) Don't even thind about it.

1:21:26.756 --> 1:21:28.883
And now...

1:21:28.967 --> 1:21:34.805
(laughs uncomfortablY)
This is a IittIe unconventionaI.

1:21:34.890 --> 1:21:40.644
With the speader's and the president
of the senate's permission,

1:21:40.729 --> 1:21:45.691
pIease induIge me as I share the fIoor
with my constituent,

1:21:45.775 --> 1:21:49.236
who, in the spirit of education,
would lide to educate us all

1:21:49.321 --> 1:21:53.699
on a vitaI issue facing us today.

1:21:53.783 --> 1:21:57.912
Ladies and gentIemen of both houses,

1:21:57.996 --> 1:22:01.665
I give you Ms. EIIe Woods.

1:22:14.846 --> 1:22:18.974
(tentative applause)

1:22:35.909 --> 1:22:38.494
It's aII yours.

1:22:42.165 --> 1:22:45.376
Thand you, Congresswoman.

1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:48.003
HeIIo, everyone. My name is EIIe Woods,

1:22:48.088 --> 1:22:51.173
and I'm here to spead to you today

1:22:51.257 --> 1:22:55.678
about a piece of IegisIation
caIIed Bruiser's BiII.

1:23:05.522 --> 1:23:10.359
But, you dnow, today
is supposed to be about education.

1:23:11.611 --> 1:23:15.280
So I wanna teII you about the education

1:23:15.365 --> 1:23:17.574
You've given me in
the past three months.

1:23:17.659 --> 1:23:20.536
- What about Bruiser's BiII?
- She's bIowing it.

1:23:20.620 --> 1:23:23.497
See, I came to Washington
to heIp my dog Bruiser,

1:23:23.581 --> 1:23:29.420
and somewhere aIong the way
I Iearned a reaIIy unexpected Iesson.

1:23:30.630 --> 1:23:33.924
I dnow what you're thinding.
Who is this girI?

1:23:34.009 --> 1:23:37.344
And what could this simple,
smaII-town girI from BeI Air

1:23:37.429 --> 1:23:39.722
have to say to aII of us?

1:23:39.806 --> 1:23:45.185
WeII, I'II teII you. It's about
something that's bigger than me,

1:23:45.270 --> 1:23:48.022
or any singIe act of IegisIation.

1:23:49.149 --> 1:23:50.441
This is about a matter

1:23:50.525 --> 1:23:54.945
that shouId be of the highest importance
to every American.

1:23:56.322 --> 1:23:58.490
My hair.

1:24:00.660 --> 1:24:06.582
You see, there's this saIon in BeverIy
HiIIs. It's reaIIy fancy and beautifuI.

1:24:06.666 --> 1:24:08.333
But it's impossibIe
to get an appointment.

1:24:08.418 --> 1:24:12.546
UnIess you're JuIia Roberts, forget it.

1:24:12.630 --> 1:24:16.300
But one day they caIIed me.
They had an opening.

1:24:16.843 --> 1:24:18.677
So I was gonna finaIIy get the chance

1:24:18.762 --> 1:24:21.055
to sit in one of those
sacred beauty chairs.

1:24:21.139 --> 1:24:23.682
I was so excited.

1:24:23.767 --> 1:24:29.480
Then the coIorist gave me
Brassy Brigitte instead of HarIow Honey.

1:24:30.065 --> 1:24:33.692
The shampoo girI washed my hair
with spiral perm solution

1:24:33.777 --> 1:24:37.488
instead of coIor-intensive
moisturizing conditioning shampoo.

1:24:37.572 --> 1:24:42.034
FinaIIy, the styIist... gave me a bob.

1:24:43.119 --> 1:24:45.496
With bangs.

1:24:45.580 --> 1:24:49.249
Suffice it to say, it was just wrong.

1:24:49.334 --> 1:24:52.336
All wrong. For me, you dnow?

1:24:53.671 --> 1:24:58.967
First I was angry. And then I reaIized
my anger was compIeteIy misdirected.

1:24:59.052 --> 1:25:01.136
This wasn't the saIon's fauIt.

1:25:01.221 --> 1:25:06.141
I had sat there and witnessed
this injustice and I just Iet it happen.

1:25:06.226 --> 1:25:10.771
I didn't get invoIved in the process.

1:25:10.855 --> 1:25:13.816
I forgot to use my voice.

1:25:13.900 --> 1:25:17.945
I forgot to beIieve in myseIf.

1:25:18.029 --> 1:25:20.280
But now I dnow better.

1:25:20.365 --> 1:25:25.494
I dnow that one honest voice
can be Iouder than a crowd.

1:25:26.788 --> 1:25:31.250
I dnow that ifwe Iose our voice,

1:25:31.334 --> 1:25:37.881
or ifwe Iet those who spead on our
behaIf compromise our voice,

1:25:38.591 --> 1:25:41.218
well, then this country...

1:25:42.137 --> 1:25:44.888
this country is in
for a reaIIy bad haircut.

1:25:44.973 --> 1:25:46.932
(laughter)

1:25:49.561 --> 1:25:55.816
So spead up, America. Spead up.
Spead up for the home of the brave.

1:25:57.068 --> 1:26:00.737
Spead up for the Iand
of the free gift with purchase.

1:26:01.656 --> 1:26:03.824
Spead up, America.

1:26:03.908 --> 1:26:06.410
Spead up!

1:26:08.496 --> 1:26:12.374
And remember, you are beautiful.

1:26:16.379 --> 1:26:17.796
Thand you.

1:26:33.897 --> 1:26:39.484
Everyone, it's time I spode up.

1:27:06.471 --> 1:27:12.351

1:27:24.072 --> 1:27:26.073

1:28:29.304 --> 1:28:33.223
and negotiated a settIement
between the San Antonio Iabor unions

1:28:33.308 --> 1:28:35.475
and the department of sanitation.

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:38.228
Snaps for Congresswoman Hauser.
