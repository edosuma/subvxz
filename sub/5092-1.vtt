WEBVTT

00:25.193 --> 00:26.460
(alarm chirps)

00:29.530 --> 00:30.498
You know the drill.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.501
Yeah, I'm right here.

00:33.534 --> 00:36.570
(cell phone ringing)

00:38.572 --> 00:40.674
Hey, honey, how are you?

00:40.708 --> 00:43.211
Oh, I'm just heading into
the governor's office.

00:43.244 --> 00:45.513
Doesn't look like I'm getting
out of here till after dinner.

00:47.248 --> 00:49.550
Shoot. I completely forgot.

00:49.583 --> 00:52.486
Look, uh... tell Erin
I'm sorry I missed her,

00:52.520 --> 00:55.223
and you guys have fun, okay?

00:55.256 --> 00:56.557
All right.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.592
Call you from the road.

00:59.860 --> 01:01.595
(bell ringing)

01:01.629 --> 01:03.831
Cole sends his love,
but he's stuck in Albany

01:03.864 --> 01:05.466
so he has to bag on dinner.

01:05.499 --> 01:07.235
Aw. Love back.

01:07.268 --> 01:11.105
Hey. We're two single gals,
looking for trouble tonight.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.708
BAKER:
The Haitian ambassador's
requested a meeting

01:14.742 --> 01:18.312
to formally thank you for the
NYPD's help in his country.

01:18.346 --> 01:20.448
I've slotted him in between PBA

01:20.481 --> 01:21.715
and Port Authority
Superintendant.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.284
Thank you, Baker.

01:24.618 --> 01:26.554
Have this hand-delivered
to the mayor-elect,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.356
first thing
tomorrow morning.

01:28.389 --> 01:29.357
Sir.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.791
It's customary.

01:37.665 --> 01:40.668
(door opens, closes)

01:59.820 --> 02:01.889
How's your father
faring with Mayor Poole?

02:01.922 --> 02:03.924
Well, he resigned today.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.593
Mmm!

02:05.626 --> 02:08.829
All the commissioners offer
letters of resignation

02:08.862 --> 02:10.431
when the new mayor's elected.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.766
And my father is nothing
if not customary.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.503
Well, I'm sure it will be okay.

02:15.536 --> 02:17.905
Cole has worked closely with
Poole, and he really likes him.

02:17.938 --> 02:21.642
Well, I think the question is if
Poole like Commissioner Reagan.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.411
And my dad's too proud
to sit around

02:23.444 --> 02:24.878
and wait for the ax to fall.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.699
Hello?

02:47.468 --> 02:48.602
Anybody looking for a party?

02:51.004 --> 02:52.973
(screaming)

02:53.006 --> 02:55.209
(running footsteps)

02:56.977 --> 02:58.812
Farragaut. Where do
I know that name from?

02:58.846 --> 02:59.947
JACKIE:
Yeah, he's a

02:59.980 --> 03:02.350
big fund-raiser guy
for the new mayor.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.852
You know, it's been in all the
papers the last couple months.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.587
No, no, I know about that.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.490
I'm not talking about that.
It's something else.

03:09.523 --> 03:12.426
Wait a minute.
He's married.

03:12.460 --> 03:16.997
His wife, Lisa Farragaut, she's
an old friend of my sister.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.932
I gotta make the call, Jack.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.401
Yeah, I'll be there in a few.

03:22.370 --> 03:23.937
Okay, just promise me
that you're going

03:23.971 --> 03:25.773
to let me pay
the next time.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.841
This is not a freebie.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.510
There's a guy
I want you to meet.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.412
Okay, I'm giving you
cash right now.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.014
He's divorced, he has
a daughter Nicky's age,

03:34.047 --> 03:35.683
looks like the guy on Mad Men.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.717
Ooh, poor girl.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.786
No, he does.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.020
He lives near us
in Chappaqua,

03:40.053 --> 03:41.021
but he works in Midtown.

03:41.054 --> 03:42.856
Okay. Hold on.
Danny?

03:42.890 --> 03:46.026
I'm in a restaurant.
Can I just call you right back?

03:46.059 --> 03:47.928
Yeah, actually I'm with...

03:47.961 --> 03:49.297
What?

03:50.831 --> 03:52.966
No, wh-what are
you talking about?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.305
Are you positive?

04:01.442 --> 04:03.744
Okay, I'm gonna...
I'll call you back later.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.514
No, I... I'll call you back.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.982
Erin?

04:09.016 --> 04:11.018
What's the matter?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.023
I think we should go, okay?

04:16.056 --> 04:18.526
What's going on?

04:19.660 --> 04:22.496
Just come with me.

04:22.530 --> 04:24.465
Erin?

04:24.498 --> 04:25.733
Erin, tell me what's going on.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.901
Just... let's just
go outside, okay?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.337
Erin, wait.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.771
I'm sorry,
excuse me. Excuse me.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.673
Erin, please just tell me
what Danny told you.

04:35.643 --> 04:36.610
It's Cole.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.812
What?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.782
Wh...?

04:41.815 --> 04:42.783
I'm sorry.

04:42.816 --> 04:44.017
What are you...

04:44.051 --> 04:44.952
I don't know, I...

04:44.985 --> 04:46.053
Oh, God.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.456
I don't know what to say.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.491
(sobbing)

05:15.115 --> 05:16.584
RENZULLI:
All right, guys, listen up.

05:16.617 --> 05:20.621
I'm only gonna say this once.
Just once.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.024
Each team is to blend in with
the clientele at your locations.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.760
Observe and report on
the service of alcohol to minors

05:26.794 --> 05:30.030
and/or the buying and selling
of narcotics on the premises.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.765
Reagan, you'll be
working with Atwater.

05:31.799 --> 05:33.501
Any questions?

05:33.534 --> 05:34.368
Atwater.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.636
How many nights
are we talking about?

05:35.669 --> 05:36.804
Three, tops.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.672
You'll all be back
in the bag come Friday.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.508
If we're supposed
to blend in,

05:40.541 --> 05:41.975
can we have a drink
ourselves, Sarge?

05:42.009 --> 05:44.612
Maximum two, so make it last.

05:44.645 --> 05:45.713
(laughter)

05:45.746 --> 05:47.815
All right, let's hit the street.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.650
Beats working
patrol, huh?

05:49.683 --> 05:50.784
Say that again.

05:50.818 --> 05:51.819
Hey, Reagan.

05:55.556 --> 05:58.626
So, uh, you think you can
manage out there without me?

05:58.659 --> 06:00.060
I guess we'll find out, huh?

06:00.093 --> 06:01.895
Your first
undercover assignment.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.096
It's a big night.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.632
Appreciate the opportunity,
Sarge.

06:04.665 --> 06:07.701
Just remember this:
the uniform does half the job.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.102
So eyes wide open.

06:09.136 --> 06:10.604
Okay?

06:10.638 --> 06:13.474
I want my favorite driver
back in one piece.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.788
Lisa.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.493
(sighs)

06:34.795 --> 06:38.632
I'm so sorry.

06:38.666 --> 06:39.967
Is there's anything I can do?

06:40.000 --> 06:41.702
Thank you, Frank.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.638
We'll do everything possible
to find who did this,

06:44.672 --> 06:45.639
I promise you.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.876
I'm going to take her home
and spend the night.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.611
No, no, that's really
not necessary.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.612
Please, please.

06:51.645 --> 06:52.880
Can you take Nicky for the night

06:52.913 --> 06:54.482
and make sure
she gets to school?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.783
Done.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.718
I need to get out of here.
I'll meet you out front.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.688
Dad...

07:00.721 --> 07:03.824
Cole told her he was stuck in
Albany and couldn't make dinner.

07:08.529 --> 07:10.063
Do the detectives know?
No.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.633
No, I haven't left her side.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.469
Does the mayor know he's dead?

07:15.503 --> 07:16.904
He knows.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.772
Go with Lisa, I'll get Nicky.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.708
Thanks.

07:20.741 --> 07:21.709
(sighs)

07:21.742 --> 07:23.744
(laughter, chattering,
country music playing)

07:25.746 --> 07:27.748
Here you go, pal.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.085
Twenty-eight.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.723
For-for two drinks?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.625
Service included.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.236
Bet you a drink I can guess
where you went to college.

07:49.269 --> 07:52.673
Um, sorry, but I'm not a...
not a gambling man.

07:52.706 --> 07:54.542
Oh, it's not
gambling.

07:54.575 --> 07:56.176
If she guesses which
college you went to,

07:56.209 --> 07:57.778
you buy us
both a drink.

08:00.013 --> 08:00.981
She's, uh, really good.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.116
She's, like, got sick sense.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.985
You mean,
sixth sense?

08:05.018 --> 08:06.086
(laughs)

08:06.119 --> 08:07.154
Yeah.

08:07.187 --> 08:11.925
Okay. I get to ask
three questions.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.862
Mandy, don't
be a whore.

08:14.895 --> 08:15.829
Screw you, Brian.

08:15.863 --> 08:17.965
I was just guessing
where he went to college.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.836
Westchester Community?

08:22.870 --> 08:23.904
(laughter)

08:23.937 --> 08:25.539
Mm, I'm fading.

08:25.573 --> 08:26.740
Bump me?

08:33.814 --> 08:35.282
Little young for you, no?

08:35.315 --> 08:38.051
Just minding my own
business here, pal.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.720
You saying my girlfriend
was hitting on you?

08:39.753 --> 08:41.521
Not saying anything.

08:42.823 --> 08:46.860
Bry-bry... take it
someplace else.

08:50.798 --> 08:52.065
(scoffs)

08:52.099 --> 08:53.066
Dalton lacrosse goons.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.602
I swear to God, they put

08:54.635 --> 08:55.769
something in the water
over there.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.004
Yeah.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.171
Hey, I know you, right?

08:58.205 --> 08:59.840
I don't think so.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.742
Yeah, yeah, I do.

09:01.775 --> 09:02.843
Noble Sanfino.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.645
Jimmy. How you doing?

09:04.678 --> 09:06.079
Saint David's, right?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.915
Sorry man, can't help you.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.950
No, no, no, no, no, no, I...

09:09.983 --> 09:11.318
I know I know you.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.789
Whatever.

09:15.823 --> 09:17.124
(chuckles)

09:17.157 --> 09:19.860
It'll come to me.

09:26.133 --> 09:28.201
Hey.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.703
How's Lisa doing?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.271
I just spent the
night at her house.

09:31.304 --> 09:32.606
Neither slept a wink.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.907
What do you got?

09:33.941 --> 09:36.009
Nothing that's going to
give her any comfort.

09:36.043 --> 09:39.012
Her husband wasn't
in Albany yesterday.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.313
At all.

09:40.347 --> 09:41.048
Where was he?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.050
Good question.
(phone ringing)

09:43.083 --> 09:45.018
The labs are processing the
evidence from the crime scene,

09:45.052 --> 09:47.387
trying to put together a time
line of his last few hours.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.388
Reagan.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.791
Parking records show that he got

09:50.824 --> 09:52.292
five tickets
in the last three months

09:52.325 --> 09:54.227
on a pretty skeevy block
in the Lower East Side.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.362
Gonna head
over there now.

09:55.395 --> 09:57.865
I'm not heading anywhere.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.800
I got called back to court.
Can't your people

09:59.833 --> 10:00.834
get their ducks
in a row?

10:00.868 --> 10:02.736
It's my third round
with the same grand jury.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.038
Maybe they can't get enough
of your pretty face.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.874
You just start the canvass,

10:06.907 --> 10:08.008
I'll try to catch
up, all right?
Yeah.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.409
Can I ride along?

10:09.442 --> 10:11.111
No.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.413
But what you can do
is accidentally

10:13.446 --> 10:16.249
bump into my partner
while she's down there, okay?

10:16.283 --> 10:19.319
See how the
real pros work.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.321
Take it easy, all right?

10:21.354 --> 10:22.656
Thanks.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.197
Excuse me, sir.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.699
Can I ask you a question?

10:31.732 --> 10:33.366
NYPD.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.802
You recognize this guy?

10:36.837 --> 10:38.271
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.874
Yeah? When's the last time
you see him?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.810
This morning.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.878
Right here.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.747
Yeah, very funny. In person.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.448
No, just on
the paper.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.549
(sighs):
All right.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.985
Look, you might want to
talk to this guy over there,

10:52.019 --> 10:53.687
uh, Dexter or Darrell.

10:53.721 --> 10:56.256
He's kind of like the
mayor of the block.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.691
The guy in the hat?

10:57.725 --> 10:58.759
In the green shirt.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.860
All right, thank you.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.862
Yo, Darrell!

11:01.895 --> 11:03.330
(horn honking)
What?

11:03.363 --> 11:05.132
Relax. What's your problem?

11:05.165 --> 11:06.466
Darrell, NYPD.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.168
Yo! Excuse me, sir.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.704
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:10.738 --> 11:12.840
Hey, hey, you know
this guy?
Yeah, I know him.

11:12.873 --> 11:13.974
You kill this guy?

11:14.007 --> 11:15.876
No! I knew him. That's all.

11:15.909 --> 11:16.810
Why you running, then?

11:16.844 --> 11:19.813
My parole officer,
she found violations in,

11:19.847 --> 11:20.914
like, I blink my eyes.

11:20.948 --> 11:23.350
If she found out that
I got questioned about a guy

11:23.383 --> 11:25.185
who got killed...
All right, calm down. Calm down.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.020
You're not in trouble;
just answer my questions.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.188
Forget about her.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.890
He comes by sometimes

11:29.923 --> 11:31.725
two, three times a week.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.061
Drives a Range Rover--
expensive, you know?

11:34.094 --> 11:36.196
A while back,
we made a little deal:

11:36.229 --> 11:38.932
he flip me a 20,
and I watch his car.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.768
You watch his car-- the one
that has all the tickets?

11:40.801 --> 11:42.002
You're a great lookout.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.737
He-he don't care about tickets.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.005
I'm watching for tow trucks.

11:45.038 --> 11:46.373
All right, when was
the last time you saw him?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.041
Yesterday around 6:00.

11:48.075 --> 11:48.942
What building?

11:48.976 --> 11:51.411
344. Apartment 1-B.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.847
1-B. Why do you know 1-B
when you're watching his car?

11:53.881 --> 11:57.217
'Cause he said if the tow truck
come, buzz 1-B.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.920
(siren whoops)
All right, how long does it
take him to come out?

11:59.953 --> 12:02.756
I don't know. I had to have
dinner at my mother's at 8:30.

12:02.790 --> 12:04.124
You go to your
mom's for dinner.

12:04.157 --> 12:05.158
(siren whoops)
Okay, okay.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.493
No, no, just
relax. Relax.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.328
Officer, come babysit
my friend here.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.496
One of you
come with me.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.031
JACKIE:
Just chill out.

12:11.064 --> 12:13.033
Farragaut was here yesterday.
1-B.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.868
Hey. Perfect timing.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.003
We're in here now.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.905
Can you open the door
for us, sir?

12:18.972 --> 12:21.875
It was a girl, young,
in her 20s.

12:21.909 --> 12:22.876
What's her name?

12:22.910 --> 12:26.013
I'm not good with names;
I call them all honey.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.015
But I thought I heard fighting
coming from there

12:28.048 --> 12:29.549
when I was having my
dinner last night.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.051
And what'd you do?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.352
It was dinner.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.354
When I was finished,
it had already stopped.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.522
You know the signs--

12:35.555 --> 12:37.057
you see something,
you say something.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.192
(sighs)
That's about terrorists.

12:39.226 --> 12:40.527
She's just a girl.

12:40.560 --> 12:42.129
All right, move over.

12:42.162 --> 12:43.463
(knocking)

12:43.496 --> 12:46.466
NYPD! Anyone home?

12:48.035 --> 12:48.969
Hello?

12:49.002 --> 12:50.470
Coming in.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.305
(door creaking)

12:52.339 --> 12:54.007
Hello?

13:04.217 --> 13:06.219
JACKIE:
Hello?

13:14.027 --> 13:15.495
Oh... pfft.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.142
How old did you say
this girl was?

13:29.176 --> 13:32.012
Maybe 25.
(Jackie sighs)

13:32.045 --> 13:34.381
All right, well, her clothes
are gone, cosmetics are gone.

13:34.414 --> 13:37.885
So is she, so...
thank you for the backup.

13:37.918 --> 13:39.286
Somebody liked
little girls.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.088
This is like a movie set.

13:41.121 --> 13:44.191
Yeah, like Gidget Goes to Hell.

13:44.224 --> 13:48.028
Well, looks like Mr. Farragaut
had a dirty little secret.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.329
My God.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.164
(sighs heavily)

13:55.068 --> 13:57.170
Oh! Erin, go outside.

13:59.106 --> 14:00.073
Yeah, this is
Detective Curatola.

14:00.107 --> 14:04.111
I'm at 344 East Second Street,
Apartment 1-Boy,

14:04.144 --> 14:07.280
requesting an "A" run
from Crime Scene.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.319
We're here.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.554
Oh.
HENRY:
Wow.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.456
Why wasn't I invited?

14:16.489 --> 14:17.991
LINDA:
I am loving this dress.

14:18.025 --> 14:18.992
Thank you.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.160
Dad!
Wow.

14:20.193 --> 14:23.897
Guys, if you finish your
homework, I rented Waterboy.

14:23.931 --> 14:24.898
Yes.
Sweet.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.467
I'm here.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.169
Wow.

14:29.202 --> 14:31.171
Why am I going to this again?

14:31.204 --> 14:33.173
Because Tony Bennett is singing

14:33.206 --> 14:34.674
and because
the new mayor invited you.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.944
It is customary
for a new mayor

14:36.977 --> 14:38.645
to review
the standing commissioners

14:38.678 --> 14:40.680
from his transition office,

14:40.713 --> 14:42.449
not at a
fund-raiser.

14:42.482 --> 14:44.451
Maybe he wanted
to get to know you better.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.019
If Tony wasn't singing,
I'd have passed.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.021
And maybe he knew that.

14:48.989 --> 14:50.991
Don't burn the bridge, Francis.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.228
Erin, how's your friend Lisa
holding up?

14:55.262 --> 14:58.298
Oh, not so good, but her mom and
both her brothers are with her.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.399
What have you told her?

14:59.432 --> 15:01.201
As little as possible.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.402
All set,
there you go.

15:02.435 --> 15:03.636
Thank you.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.075
Wow.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.577
(laughs)

15:10.610 --> 15:12.212
Thanks for being
my date tonight.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.446
You're welcome.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.216
Although maybe it's
time you both started

15:16.249 --> 15:18.051
seeing other people.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.286
Just saying.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.325
(car horns honking)

15:26.326 --> 15:29.997
(indistinct chatter)

15:30.030 --> 15:32.299
Commissioner Reagan.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.301
Mr. Mayor.

15:34.334 --> 15:35.435
Do you know my daughter?

15:35.468 --> 15:36.603
Erin.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.605
Heard good things,
many good things.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.440
Congratulations
on your election.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.509
Well, on the shoulders
of giants,

15:42.542 --> 15:43.743
not the least of which was

15:43.776 --> 15:46.646
our late, great friend
Cole Farragaut.

15:46.679 --> 15:50.317
That aches and it will
for a very, very long time.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.251
Yes.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.089
Frank, may I have a word
in private, please?

15:56.123 --> 15:57.490
Sure.

15:57.524 --> 15:58.491
Erin, it was a pleasure.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.264
Have you spoken to Cole's widow?

16:04.297 --> 16:05.598
I have.

16:05.632 --> 16:08.135
It's the random acts
of violence

16:08.168 --> 16:09.702
that are the worst
tragedies of all.

16:11.538 --> 16:14.741
Random, senseless.

16:14.774 --> 16:16.076
A damn carjacking.

16:16.109 --> 16:18.778
Where they didn't even
keep the car?

16:18.811 --> 16:21.748
Hmm.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.618
Cole's family is going
through a living hell.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.320
The sooner we can dispose
of this case

16:27.354 --> 16:28.755
and get it
out of the news cycle,

16:28.788 --> 16:31.224
the sooner
we can begin to heal.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.263
So I got your letter
of resignation.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.331
Can I assume
you will consider staying on?

16:39.666 --> 16:43.503
Commissioner serves
at the mayor's pleasure

16:43.536 --> 16:44.737
but not at his bidding.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.140
I'm aware of that, Frank.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.677
Just so long as we
understand the difference.

16:54.381 --> 16:57.350
ANNOUNCER:
Please welcome Tony Bennett
and Carrie Underwood.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.451
(applause)

16:58.485 --> 17:02.589
* It had to be you

17:04.691 --> 17:07.160
* It had to be

17:07.194 --> 17:11.664
* You

17:11.698 --> 17:15.168
* I wandered around

17:15.202 --> 17:17.804
* And finally found

17:17.837 --> 17:21.708
* Somebody who

17:22.842 --> 17:24.811
* Could make me

17:24.844 --> 17:28.047
* Be true

17:28.881 --> 17:31.551
* Could make me be

17:31.584 --> 17:34.387
* Blue

17:34.421 --> 17:39.092
* And even be glad

17:39.126 --> 17:42.295
* Just to be sad

17:42.329 --> 17:45.132
* Thinking of you

17:46.733 --> 17:48.701
* Some others

17:48.735 --> 17:52.839
* I've seen

17:52.872 --> 17:57.177
* Might never be mean...

17:59.146 --> 18:02.115
Tony's going to think that
you don't like his song.

18:02.149 --> 18:06.153
TONY:
* Or try to be boss...

18:06.186 --> 18:07.454
What did Poole say?

18:07.487 --> 18:08.755
(sighs)

18:08.788 --> 18:10.890
He wants me to rubber-stamp
Farragaut's murder

18:10.923 --> 18:12.725
as a fatal carjacking.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.127
He said that?

18:14.161 --> 18:16.429
In so many words.

18:16.463 --> 18:19.666
Which tells me that someone
involved in the investigation

18:19.699 --> 18:22.135
told him
about the girl's apartment.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.139
He doesn't want to be
burned by a scandal

18:26.173 --> 18:28.808
in his inner circle the
moment he takes office.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.677
Not my problem.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.215
* For

18:35.248 --> 18:38.351
BOTH:
* Nobody else

18:38.385 --> 18:41.188
* Gave me a thrill

18:41.221 --> 18:43.923
* With all your faults

18:43.956 --> 18:46.693
* I love you still

18:46.726 --> 18:49.462
* It had to be you

18:49.496 --> 18:51.898
* Wonderful you

18:51.931 --> 18:57.170
* It had to be you.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.210
(applause)

19:04.944 --> 19:07.347
Thank you.

19:07.380 --> 19:12.252
Tony and I recorded that
for his 85th birthday album.

19:12.285 --> 19:13.620
(applause)

19:13.653 --> 19:14.787
Thank you.

19:14.821 --> 19:17.257
(chuckles)

19:17.290 --> 19:19.626
I see my old friend
Frank Reagan over there.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.361
By the way, my driver got
a speeding ticket.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.230
Could you take care
of that for me?

19:23.263 --> 19:25.232
(laughter)

19:25.265 --> 19:26.533
(applause)

19:27.667 --> 19:28.935
Thank you.
(chuckles)

19:32.572 --> 19:33.806
(music playing)

19:33.840 --> 19:35.842
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

19:46.319 --> 19:49.489
Hey, Long Island iced tea,
vodka, rocks.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.325
I remember
where I know you from.

19:52.359 --> 19:54.827
Okay, where?

19:54.861 --> 19:57.630
Stardust, back in the day.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.401
Maybe you remember me;
can't say I remember you

20:01.434 --> 20:03.436
or much of anything about
the nights at that place.

20:03.470 --> 20:05.505
See, if you can remember
what happened at Stardust,

20:05.538 --> 20:07.274
you weren't really
at Stardust, right?

20:07.307 --> 20:08.608
Amen.
(laughs)

20:08.641 --> 20:10.743
(laughs)
Thank you.

20:10.777 --> 20:14.281
Listen, I'm going
to meet this chick later.

20:14.314 --> 20:15.982
She's gonna need
just a little encouragement,

20:16.015 --> 20:17.083
if you know
what I mean.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.352
Anywhere you could point me
in the right direction

20:19.386 --> 20:20.253
to score a little something?

20:20.287 --> 20:22.755
Why would you think
I could point you?

20:22.789 --> 20:24.424
Stardust alum?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.596
You see that guy behind me
working his phone?

20:33.733 --> 20:36.603
Yeah, that's a cop.

20:36.636 --> 20:41.274
I never forget a face,
and I can always make a cop.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.866
Erin?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.601
Lisa, what are you doing here?

21:08.635 --> 21:11.371
At 8:00 this morning,
I had two detectives at my house

21:11.404 --> 21:13.940
with a warrant to search
Cole's home office.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.041
They took his files,

21:15.074 --> 21:16.075
they took
his laptop.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.644
It, it's just procedure.

21:17.677 --> 21:18.978
We're doing everything we can...

21:19.011 --> 21:20.713
Kyle, my youngest,

21:20.747 --> 21:23.416
asked me if his father
had done something wrong.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.818
They just need to go
through each and every detail.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.086
Do they suspect
Cole of something

21:27.119 --> 21:28.087
that ended up
in his murder?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.923
Not exactly.

21:30.957 --> 21:34.494
He was my husband,
you are my friend.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.596
I want to know
everything you know.

21:38.398 --> 21:42.101
JACKIE:
His records show Cole Farragaut
rented this studio.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.536
The whole thing
screams of love shack.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.837
Well, if somebody else
dug that up,

21:44.871 --> 21:45.838
why are we chasing
the lead?

21:45.872 --> 21:48.107
Well, word's come down
from the PC

21:48.140 --> 21:50.510
that they want us to plug
any holes on this case,

21:50.543 --> 21:52.979
so they thought it best
to be going with family.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.381
When my old man wants
something done,

21:54.414 --> 21:56.015
he usually asks me himself.

21:56.048 --> 21:59.051
I agree-- something weird
is going on around here.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.655
Police. Open up.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.070
Smells like teen spirit.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.107
I know that smell.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.711
Ah. Juicy perfume.

22:24.744 --> 22:26.012
My niece wears that.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.748
Whoever she is,
she's one tough cookie.

22:30.483 --> 22:33.486
(lock clicking)

22:36.823 --> 22:37.890
(screaming)
Shh. Shut up.

22:37.924 --> 22:39.392
Did Kiril call you?

22:39.426 --> 22:41.528
I was calling him, I... I swear.
Shh.

22:41.561 --> 22:42.562
I was calling Kiril.
Shush.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.531
Just want to ask you
a few questions.

22:44.564 --> 22:45.865
Shh.

22:45.898 --> 22:49.469
Almost from when Cole
start seeing me,

22:49.502 --> 22:52.939
he talk about wanting me
for his own.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.442
He get apartment for us

22:55.475 --> 22:58.144
and he come to take me there,

22:58.177 --> 22:59.779
but Kiril found out.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.180
How, I don't know.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.115
Who's this Kiril?

23:03.149 --> 23:06.753
Kiril my boss.

23:06.786 --> 23:10.490
Kiril always knows
what is planning.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.625
Cole get angry
and tell Kiril

23:12.659 --> 23:14.393
he does not
have me to own.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.664
You do not try
telling Kiril that.

23:17.697 --> 23:18.965
So what happened then?

23:18.998 --> 23:22.869
First, Cole punch Kiril hard,

23:22.902 --> 23:25.538
like he is taking me
no matter what.

23:26.573 --> 23:28.074
Kiril strong,
too, though.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.710
They fight more.

23:30.743 --> 23:32.579
Kiril wins.

23:32.612 --> 23:34.146
Cole stop breathing.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.718
I do nothing
because Kiril will kill me, too.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.487
JACKIE:
All right.
What's this Kiril's last name?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.722
Kiril have lot of last name.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.457
I don't know what one now.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.862
Nikolina, where's Kiril?

23:49.896 --> 23:51.097
I don't know.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.599
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.468
Probably back in Croatia,
I think.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.736
That's not what you think,
Nikolina.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.104
You think he's still here.

23:58.137 --> 23:59.305
You thought Kiril
was the one

23:59.338 --> 24:02.208
who sent my partner and me
to your apartment to get you.

24:02.241 --> 24:04.611
Now, Nikolina,
tell me where he is.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.178
I swear I don't know.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.947
All right, well, I'm going
to check with Immigration,

24:07.980 --> 24:09.849
see your status, and maybe
that'll strike up your memory.

24:09.882 --> 24:10.883
Please!

24:10.917 --> 24:13.520
I not child.

24:13.553 --> 24:17.524
I know all Cole want me for
is for sex.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.859
But last day of his life,

24:19.892 --> 24:21.594
Cole try to save me.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.963
His last wish
was for me to be free.

24:26.265 --> 24:29.001
Okay. I think we've
heard enough.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.039
Lisa, I'll try to hold her
as a material witness until...

24:33.072 --> 24:34.273
And then what?

24:34.306 --> 24:38.044
Put her on the stand so every
gory detail gets broadcast?

24:38.077 --> 24:40.079
Have my boys
live this out

24:40.112 --> 24:41.280
for the rest
of their lives?

24:41.313 --> 24:43.716
No. Let her go.

24:43.750 --> 24:44.851
Look, it's a
police matter now.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.919
I don't care.

24:46.953 --> 24:48.955
Let her go.

24:58.665 --> 24:59.666
You're saying
Lisa would rather see

24:59.699 --> 25:02.268
her husband's killer go free?

25:02.301 --> 25:05.271
If the alternative
is exposing him

25:05.304 --> 25:08.675
as getting murdered
for his obsession with a hooker,

25:08.708 --> 25:10.009
then, yes.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.111
Plus, the girl admits
that Farragaut started it,

25:12.144 --> 25:13.846
so if we put Kiril on trial,

25:13.880 --> 25:17.049
any decent defense attorney
is going to run with that.

25:17.083 --> 25:19.051
So, you're thinking

25:19.085 --> 25:21.087
about walking around
the murder charge.

25:23.122 --> 25:27.093
I think I can indict Kiril
on sex-trafficking charges,

25:27.126 --> 25:29.562
and with the right judge,
get a comparable sentence.

25:29.596 --> 25:30.897
You got the ammunition?

25:30.930 --> 25:32.699
Nikolina named six other girls.

25:32.732 --> 25:34.701
So, if I can get her
and the others

25:34.734 --> 25:37.837
as cooperating witnesses,
I have a case.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.205
I see two problems.

25:39.238 --> 25:41.207
One, there's no guarantee

25:41.240 --> 25:42.775
that Farragaut's relationship
with the girl

25:42.809 --> 25:45.177
isn't gonna come out
in court anyway.

25:45.211 --> 25:48.114
So, you run the risk of looking
like you're covering it up,

25:48.147 --> 25:50.149
and that's a hell of a risk.

25:50.182 --> 25:52.251
What's the other?

25:52.284 --> 25:54.053
When someone's murdered
in my city,

25:54.086 --> 25:57.356
I kind of like to see
the killer brought to justice.

25:57.389 --> 26:00.059
(knocking)

26:00.092 --> 26:02.094
Commissioner, Mayor-elect Poole

26:02.128 --> 26:04.363
is making a round
of the chief's offices.

26:04.396 --> 26:05.698
Scheduled?

26:05.732 --> 26:08.100
Impromptu, apparently.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.201
Should I
invite him up?

26:09.235 --> 26:11.938
Apparently, he doesn't think
he needs an invitation.

26:14.140 --> 26:16.142
Don't burn the bridge.

26:16.175 --> 26:19.111
Well, there's something to be
said for going out on top.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.312
You're not ready.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.181
Yeah?

26:22.214 --> 26:25.217
It's a hell of a lot easier
to put yourself in harm's way

26:25.251 --> 26:27.754
than it is to ask others
to do so.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.323
At least for me, anyway.

26:33.125 --> 26:36.128
Play nice.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.264
Erin. Frank.

26:38.297 --> 26:42.101
I would have been happy
to introduce you around myself.

26:42.134 --> 26:44.336
I've always found
it useful to, um,

26:44.370 --> 26:47.139
just arrive unannounced
and dive right in.

26:47.173 --> 26:51.911
Nevertheless, there is
an etiquette to this office.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.913
One that I'm sure
you'll appreciate

26:53.946 --> 26:55.848
once you start running
this city.

26:55.882 --> 26:57.316
Well, I just wanted
to commend you

26:57.349 --> 26:59.886
on whatever you did to keep
the Farragaut case on track.

26:59.919 --> 27:02.088
No commendation required.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.223
My people are working
with the DA's office

27:04.256 --> 27:06.325
to find and punish
those responsible.

27:06.358 --> 27:09.228
I see. Well, then, for seeing
that it's progressed

27:09.261 --> 27:11.297
without any leaks to the press.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.200
Well, it's not leaks
to the press

27:14.233 --> 27:16.669
that I'm worried about
right now.

27:16.703 --> 27:19.638
I'm trying to find out
who talked to you.

27:21.173 --> 27:23.242
Frank, you know,
I had a long conversation

27:23.275 --> 27:25.745
with the outgoing mayor
about you.

27:25.778 --> 27:29.248
He characterized you as having
a problem with authority.

27:31.183 --> 27:35.254
I draw a paycheck as the New
York City Police Commissioner.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.924
I not only don't have a problem
with authority.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.959
I pretty damn well define it.

27:39.992 --> 27:42.294
Well, to some, yes.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.297
But to others, Frank,
you define a kind of

27:45.331 --> 27:48.935
white, Irish-Catholic,
middle-class,

27:48.968 --> 27:51.871
last-century way
of thinking.

27:51.904 --> 27:54.273
You accept that?

27:54.306 --> 27:58.344
As you are an African-American,
Baptist,

27:58.377 --> 28:01.080
up-by-your-bootstraps
community activist

28:01.113 --> 28:03.449
whose own
polling shows

28:03.482 --> 28:05.985
deep gaps in support

28:06.018 --> 28:08.354
across racial
and ethnic divides.

28:08.387 --> 28:12.191
But still, I won the election.

28:14.093 --> 28:16.095
Thanks for dropping by.

28:19.298 --> 28:21.300
You have a good evening.

28:31.343 --> 28:32.845
Can I have same-same?

28:32.879 --> 28:34.847
Sure thing.

28:34.881 --> 28:36.883
(crowd chatter)

28:37.917 --> 28:40.119
Thanks. Hey.

28:40.152 --> 28:42.955
Hey. So, how did you
make out last night?

28:42.989 --> 28:45.758
Oh, pretty well, under
the circumstances.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.127
Yeah, sorry I froze you
out there, but, look,

28:48.160 --> 28:50.329
cops make me tense even
just hanging around.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.364
No problem.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.233
Good news, though.

28:54.266 --> 28:56.002
The doctor's in
the house tonight,

28:56.035 --> 28:58.004
and he's got
some fresh Mash.

28:58.037 --> 29:00.006
What's Mash?

29:00.039 --> 29:03.075
Where you been, man?

29:03.109 --> 29:06.946
Look, it's like blow and X
got together and had a kid.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.048
It's the best party
you've ever been to,

29:09.081 --> 29:10.316
right between your ears.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.818
I'm in.

29:11.851 --> 29:14.353
Yeah. Me first.

29:25.031 --> 29:27.867
All right, so, let me
get this straight.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.337
He kills a guy,
a guy that you know,

29:31.370 --> 29:33.005
and you're just gonna go
after him on pimping charges?

29:33.039 --> 29:34.173
Sex-trafficking.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.108
Sex... Look,
it's still a prosecutor

29:36.142 --> 29:37.343
pleading down a killer.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.311
It will carry the same sentence
as manslaughter

29:39.345 --> 29:40.980
if I can make it stick.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.281
Yeah, but did you speak
to Dad about this?

29:42.314 --> 29:44.416
Yeah, earlier today
in his office.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.918
And what happened?
Did he throw you out

29:45.952 --> 29:47.419
of his office himself,
or did he have

29:47.453 --> 29:49.421
his security
throw you out?

29:49.455 --> 29:51.891
I think that he is
wise enough to see

29:51.924 --> 29:53.926
that a murder trail
would only mean

29:53.960 --> 29:56.195
that Lisa and her boys would
be utterly humiliated.

29:56.228 --> 29:57.930
I don't see the justice in that.

29:57.964 --> 30:01.300
I cannot follow you
down that alley, Erin.

30:01.333 --> 30:04.336
I'm not asking you
for backup here, Danny.

30:06.105 --> 30:08.107
(sighs)

30:10.109 --> 30:13.412
Look, to make the trafficking
charge stick, you need the girl.

30:13.445 --> 30:15.347
Right?
Jackie has been

30:15.381 --> 30:17.049
hammering her for hours.

30:17.083 --> 30:18.550
She will not give up Kiril.

30:18.584 --> 30:20.920
Do you really think
you have a better way?

30:20.953 --> 30:23.289
She won't give him up for us,

30:23.322 --> 30:25.057
but maybe she'll
do it for herself.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.459
(knocking)

30:28.928 --> 30:31.297
Erin, we're ready
for the interview.

30:35.401 --> 30:37.403
(loud chatter and laughter)

30:42.508 --> 30:45.077
(sniffs in,
clears his throat)

30:45.111 --> 30:47.113
(distorted speech)

30:58.357 --> 31:00.292
Whoa!

31:00.326 --> 31:02.061
Did you get some?
Not yet.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.130
Oh, back there.
He's expecting you.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.098
Um...
(clears throat)

31:06.132 --> 31:07.333
You okay, man?

31:07.366 --> 31:09.135
Yeah, it's just
some ride, dude.

31:09.168 --> 31:11.904
I feel like the back of
my head is sliding off.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.406
(sniffles)

31:15.441 --> 31:16.542
(sighs)

31:16.575 --> 31:18.410
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Hey!

31:18.444 --> 31:20.046
What the...?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.981
Get... Hey! No!
PEOPLE:
Oh!

31:22.014 --> 31:24.483
No. Hey, hey!
All right...

31:24.516 --> 31:26.185
Get him out.
Call 911.

31:26.218 --> 31:27.553
Not for an OD.
House rules.

31:27.586 --> 31:29.588
Get him the hell
out of here!

31:34.493 --> 31:36.562
Hey, you're gonna be
seated. Wait for a seat.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.330
Excuse me.
Oh, okay.

31:38.364 --> 31:40.332
(indistinct chatter)

31:40.366 --> 31:42.368
Ah.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.537
Yeah, I need an ambulance,

31:45.571 --> 31:47.173
corner of 88th and Third.

31:47.206 --> 31:48.474
Possible overdose.
88th and Third.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.575
Make it quick.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.443
Did he ever beat you?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.580
What kind of beatings?

31:54.613 --> 31:56.582
Hitting.

31:56.615 --> 31:59.651
Cigarette burns
to back of knees.

31:59.685 --> 32:02.088
How much longer
can this go on?

32:02.121 --> 32:04.423
I think she knows
what she's doing.

32:04.456 --> 32:06.492
Those special
football shoes.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.595
What do you call them,
with the things on the bottom?

32:09.628 --> 32:11.097
Cleats.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.632
Yes.

32:13.665 --> 32:16.102
He'd put those on
and kick you all over.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.507
Do you know where Kiril is?

32:21.540 --> 32:23.175
No.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.377
You don't know where he is,

32:25.411 --> 32:27.579
but you know a place
where he might go.

32:27.613 --> 32:31.750
A club, a park, a
friend or a relative?

32:31.783 --> 32:33.552
No, I don't know.

32:33.585 --> 32:36.088
You only go free
if you tell the truth.

32:36.122 --> 32:37.623
I don't know.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.191
You can only truly

32:39.225 --> 32:41.227
be free
if Kiril is off the streets.

32:41.260 --> 32:42.394
You know that.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.763
Kiril always find a way out.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.465
No, not this time.

32:46.498 --> 32:48.134
Is there a place

32:48.167 --> 32:49.601
where we can find Kiril,
arrest him

32:49.635 --> 32:52.471
and make him pay
for what he has done to you

32:52.504 --> 32:55.441
and to all the
other girls?

33:00.712 --> 33:02.714
(sobbing)

33:07.553 --> 33:09.188
Nikolina.

33:18.297 --> 33:21.767
There is a cafe in Astoria

33:21.800 --> 33:26.105
where they show Croatian
football match by satellite.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.740
(men speaking Croatian)

33:28.774 --> 33:29.775
(grunts)

33:36.682 --> 33:38.150
Get out of the way.

33:38.184 --> 33:39.618
Kiril Farkas,
you're under arrest.

33:39.651 --> 33:42.321
Get up. Get up!

33:42.354 --> 33:43.722
I want lawyer.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.457
You'll get a lawyer
when you're arraigned.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.425
I know my rights.

33:46.458 --> 33:47.226
Well, you have the
right to remain silent.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.661
Why don't you shut
the hell up. Go.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.670
Put him in the box.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.139
I want my lawyer now.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.107
Yeah, yeah.
Do you understand
English?

34:01.140 --> 34:02.574
Yeah, yeah, whatever.
Give me his number,

34:02.608 --> 34:04.176
I'll let him know
you're our guest.

34:04.210 --> 34:05.711
JACKIE:
Is that Kiril?

34:05.744 --> 34:09.081
He is... is Kiril.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.249
Is she back there?

34:10.282 --> 34:12.851
That lying little whore?!
Is that why you bring me here?!

34:12.884 --> 34:13.819
Hey, hey!
Come on.

34:13.852 --> 34:17.523
You kill your boyfriend
and blame me, huh?!

34:17.556 --> 34:19.225
Lock him down.
Is that what
we doing here?

34:19.258 --> 34:20.626
Shut your face.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.828
Okay, okay, I get it now.

34:22.861 --> 34:25.331
Kiril have the Google;
I know boyfriend VIP.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.599
So, what, whore kills boyfriend
but his VIP friends...

34:27.633 --> 34:29.135
Hey, shut your mouth!

34:29.168 --> 34:30.269
Shut up!

34:30.302 --> 34:32.104
KIRIL:
All right.

34:32.138 --> 34:33.239
So, come on, arrest me!

34:33.272 --> 34:34.640
Let's get CNN;
I tell all about him.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.508
Looks like we're down
that alley now.

34:36.542 --> 34:37.809
Okay, well,
you're not.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.111
I'm not?

34:39.145 --> 34:40.346
I just arrested this guy
on your charges.

34:40.379 --> 34:41.880
What the hell you want me
to do with him now?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.483
I tell all about
Mr. Big Shot Pervert Guy

34:44.516 --> 34:46.218
and his little whore!

34:46.252 --> 34:48.154
Just put him in a cell.

34:48.187 --> 34:49.221
Yeah? And then what?

34:49.255 --> 34:50.289
Detective.

34:50.322 --> 34:52.124
Who are you?

34:52.158 --> 34:54.593
I'm Agent Stark with Immigration
and Customs Enforcement.

34:54.626 --> 34:57.229
I have orders to take over
custody of Mr. Farkas.

34:57.263 --> 34:58.230
Immigration?

34:58.264 --> 34:59.498
On what authority?

34:59.531 --> 35:01.833
U.S. Department of Justice.

35:01.867 --> 35:04.170
Mr. Farkas is being deported
to Croatia.

35:04.203 --> 35:04.970
Croatia?

35:05.003 --> 35:06.638
Where they have
an active warrant

35:06.672 --> 35:08.274
for his arrest.
Croatia?

35:08.307 --> 35:09.341
(chuckles):
Okay.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.909
Okay, I want lawyer now.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.511
You'll get lawyer.
He'll be waiting for you

35:12.544 --> 35:13.612
at the terminal
in Zagreb.

35:13.645 --> 35:14.780
No. No!

35:14.813 --> 35:15.781
I have papers!

35:15.814 --> 35:17.916
You can't send me back!

35:17.949 --> 35:20.252
(shouting in Croatian)
I kill you!

35:20.286 --> 35:21.052
No, no.

35:21.086 --> 35:22.588
No, come on.
Please, please, please.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.524
He will stand trial in Croatia,
is that right?

35:25.557 --> 35:27.259
Yes, but not the kind

35:27.293 --> 35:28.927
that's gonna have
reporters covering it.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.163
Just a judge
and a hangman.

35:38.737 --> 35:41.840
The trial over there
will never become public.

35:41.873 --> 35:44.676
It's not the way
I planned it at all, but...

35:44.710 --> 35:46.945
But you know
what they say.

35:46.978 --> 35:50.182
You want to make God laugh,
tell him your plans.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.285
How will you manage?

35:53.319 --> 35:58.290
I have three boys who
need me now twice as much.

35:58.324 --> 36:00.892
It's not the time for hiding out
or feeling sorry for myself.

36:00.926 --> 36:02.894
But you will take care
of yourself.

36:02.928 --> 36:05.497
Yes, yes,
by taking care of them.

36:05.531 --> 36:06.765
(laughs)

36:06.798 --> 36:08.834
Take a look at
our Christmas card this year

36:08.867 --> 36:10.269
and let me know how I'm doing.

36:10.302 --> 36:12.271
Deal.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.240
Thank you.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.343
You're a good friend.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.284
FRANK:
Well, with a strong background
in community activism

36:25.317 --> 36:26.985
in a city as diverse
as New York,

36:27.018 --> 36:29.621
you'd be bound to have some
connections with Immigration.

36:29.655 --> 36:31.457
I've made a few friends
along the way.

36:31.490 --> 36:33.992
Some of them
in Immigration.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.395
Good friends to have.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.829
Apparently.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.268
Well, whatever favors
were done, Frank,

36:42.301 --> 36:43.369
were done for the common good.

36:43.402 --> 36:44.570
Wouldn't you agree?

36:44.603 --> 36:46.705
(sighs)

36:46.738 --> 36:49.675
Well, assuming
you don't disagree,

36:49.708 --> 36:53.245
I do appreciate the discretion
shown by your department.

36:53.279 --> 36:55.814
Let's be clear--
I did nothing for you.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.918
If you're returning my letter
because you think

36:59.951 --> 37:01.019
I played ball here,

37:01.052 --> 37:02.354
you're misguided.

37:02.388 --> 37:03.589
That's not why, Frank.

37:03.622 --> 37:05.891
No?

37:05.924 --> 37:07.293
No, it isn't.

37:07.326 --> 37:09.461
Listen, I could, um,
bring back public hangings

37:09.495 --> 37:10.729
to Washington Square Park

37:10.762 --> 37:12.598
and I'll still be labeled
soft on crime,

37:12.631 --> 37:14.833
so that's part of it, sure.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.868
But there's something else.

37:19.338 --> 37:22.508
When I was a kid in Bed-Stuy,
they would, um,

37:22.541 --> 37:27.279
lock up the hoop courts every
weekend due to budget cuts.

37:27.313 --> 37:29.415
But there was this one cop
from the precinct

37:29.448 --> 37:32.318
who got a key somehow, and he
would come out Saturday morning,

37:32.351 --> 37:34.052
open them up,
come back and kick us out

37:34.085 --> 37:36.388
at the end of the day
and lock up.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.426
There's really no way
you'd remember me,

37:40.459 --> 37:41.627
but I remember you.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.633
And it was the first time
that I considered

37:47.666 --> 37:51.437
a white Irish cop
could be one of the good guys.

37:51.470 --> 37:54.306
And that still goes?

37:54.340 --> 37:56.708
I want you to stay on
as my police commissioner.

38:03.482 --> 38:04.783
Well...

38:12.924 --> 38:14.593
Thank you.

38:16.595 --> 38:18.330
Can I ask a favor?

38:18.364 --> 38:19.998
Shoot.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.967
I'd like to think about it.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.503
Give you my answer
Monday morning.

38:26.405 --> 38:27.539
All right, your half-
hour starts now.

38:27.573 --> 38:28.540
Okay.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.442
So, what did he say?

38:30.476 --> 38:32.378
The mayor asked me to stay on.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.712
NICKY: Wow, that's awesome!
ERIN: Well, that's great news!

38:33.745 --> 38:35.381
FRANK:
Just hold on a minute.

38:35.414 --> 38:37.683
I told him I'd give him
my answer Monday morning.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.650
Made him wait?

38:38.684 --> 38:39.418
Yeah.

38:40.586 --> 38:41.887
Get you, messing
with the new mayor.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.355
But this is
great news.

38:44.423 --> 38:46.091
He needs you
more than you need him.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.061
What is this, some kind
of negotiation here, Dad?

38:50.095 --> 38:53.365
No, it's a decision
that affects the whole family,

38:53.399 --> 38:55.367
so I thought I'd give you all

38:55.401 --> 38:56.668
a chance to weigh in.

38:56.702 --> 38:58.737
There are two of you--

38:58.770 --> 39:00.138
and soon enough,

39:00.171 --> 39:01.573
maybe three--

39:01.607 --> 39:03.442
who, like it or not,

39:03.475 --> 39:05.477
have your old man
as your ultimate boss.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.846
Or else, the guy

39:07.879 --> 39:09.848
down the street
who throws a long shadow.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.583
Well, that's never been
a problem for me.

39:11.617 --> 39:13.419
Oh, sure it has.

39:13.452 --> 39:14.486
For all of you.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.656
You boys never wonder
if you catch a case

39:17.689 --> 39:19.458
'cause of who your old man is?

39:21.627 --> 39:25.864
When I was PC,
if guys were letting off steam

39:25.897 --> 39:29.435
or shooting the bull about
some gray area of the job,

39:29.468 --> 39:32.137
they'd clam up
when your dad came around.

39:32.170 --> 39:35.974
He felt outside the circle,

39:36.007 --> 39:37.576
'cause of my position.

39:37.609 --> 39:39.044
Never heard that from me.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.512
You really think I didn't know?

39:41.480 --> 39:44.516
Well, since we get to weigh in,

39:44.550 --> 39:47.953
I say better the devil you know
than the devil you don't know.

39:47.986 --> 39:48.987
(all chuckle)

39:49.020 --> 39:50.856
Nice.
He knows what I mean.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.023
LINDA:
Okay.

39:52.057 --> 39:53.158
And conversely,
I can always

39:53.191 --> 39:56.962
pick up the phone and get
the PC on the line any time.

39:56.995 --> 39:59.731
I know a lot of guys
would be glad if you stayed.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.567
Up and down the ranks.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.802
You know what,
let's just take a vote.

40:03.835 --> 40:07.473
All in favor of Grandpa?

40:16.882 --> 40:21.086
Francis, you can't abstain
in your own election.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.593
(sighs)

40:27.626 --> 40:29.628
(all murmuring)

40:39.838 --> 40:41.507
At the table,
you said

40:41.540 --> 40:43.241
a lot of men would be
glad if I stayed on.

40:43.274 --> 40:44.510
Are you one of them?

40:44.543 --> 40:47.579
I can handle it.

40:47.613 --> 40:48.947
I voted yes.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.121
Excuse me, sir, this pier
is within a New York City park.

40:56.154 --> 40:57.623
You can't smoke here.

40:59.658 --> 41:00.826
I'm sorry, Officer.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.663
How about if I just
let it go out?

41:04.696 --> 41:08.099
You have a good night,
Commissioner.

41:08.133 --> 41:10.135
Thank you, Officer.

41:14.673 --> 41:15.941
(sighs)

41:15.974 --> 41:19.845
Sure not gonna miss having
a nanny in City Hall.

41:22.781 --> 41:24.516
You are still the PC, Dad.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.230
(sighs)

41:39.264 --> 41:40.666
That bar you
were working

41:40.699 --> 41:43.101
was padlocked by the
state this morning.

41:43.134 --> 41:44.570
That's a good thing.

41:44.603 --> 41:46.304
And the guy you took
to the hospital

41:46.337 --> 41:48.640
has been calling around,
trying to find you.

41:48.674 --> 41:50.942
He was?

41:50.976 --> 41:52.678
How did you know that?

41:52.711 --> 41:54.980
OCCB has a tap on his phones.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.984
Okay.

41:59.017 --> 42:00.586
What's going on here?

42:00.619 --> 42:03.722
His father and his uncle
are captains

42:03.755 --> 42:05.691
in the Cavazerre crime family.

42:05.724 --> 42:06.658
He's a wise guy?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.694
His record's clean,

42:08.727 --> 42:10.862
but nobody thinks
that tells the whole story.

42:12.864 --> 42:13.899
Whoa.

42:13.932 --> 42:18.904
OCCB has tried to get inside
the Cavazerre family

42:18.937 --> 42:23.575
for a couple of years,
but with no luck.

42:23.609 --> 42:26.745
My guess, when the time's right,
they'll come to you.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.581
With your blessing?

42:33.118 --> 42:37.022
Son, I think you can do anything
you set your mind to.

42:37.055 --> 42:39.057
So, as your PC, sure.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.695
(sighs)

42:43.729 --> 42:46.197
But as your father...
