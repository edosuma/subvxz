the Americans, as I found out.

18:38.634 --> 18:42.836
Really? And what did you
find out, my little dove?

18:48.343 --> 18:51.545
I must go and change.

18:51.647 --> 18:54.014
The journey,
it was very long.

18:56.685 --> 19:00.503
The exchange
was supposed to be
a civilian operation, eh?

19:00.605 --> 19:03.573
I anticipated them,
and I was right.

19:03.675 --> 19:06.910
They sent a top agent.

19:07.012 --> 19:11.281
I had the office check him,
but there's no file on this man.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.199
He was good.

19:13.385 --> 19:15.335
Very smooth.

19:15.437 --> 19:17.838
And very tough.

19:17.940 --> 19:20.808
Perhaps even as good
as you, Sergei.

19:21.611 --> 19:23.310
And his name?

19:23.412 --> 19:27.514
Surely when you were
finding out how tough
and how smooth he was,

19:27.617 --> 19:28.682
you found out his name?

19:28.784 --> 19:31.135
He called himself
Condorman.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.589
Condorman?

19:37.777 --> 19:39.576
How quaint.

19:39.679 --> 19:44.414
But he is good. The way
he handled those three
Turks was impressive.

19:45.918 --> 19:49.519
Had they got hold of you,
who knows what would have
happened?

19:49.621 --> 19:52.205
But you were stupid to be
seen by a Chinese agent,

19:52.307 --> 19:56.343
and I am not one to let
anybody jeopardize
my position, am I?

19:56.445 --> 19:59.580
My dear Natalia, that is
why I've changed my mind

19:59.681 --> 20:02.716
about bringing you
with me to Monte Carlo
to act as hostess

20:02.818 --> 20:06.220
to the oil meetings
with our Arabian friends.

20:06.322 --> 20:08.922
You see, you need
a little re-education

20:09.024 --> 20:11.975
to remind you
of the teachings
of our masters.

21:14.006 --> 21:17.174
Harry. My Laser Lady.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.726
[snoring]

21:24.867 --> 21:27.166
Isn't she beautiful?

21:29.938 --> 21:32.105
Who is Condorman?

21:32.207 --> 21:35.308
- Condorman?
- Condorman.

21:35.411 --> 21:37.744
Well, uh, Condorman
is what we call a comic hero.

21:37.846 --> 21:39.946
- In a comic book.
- A comic book?

21:40.048 --> 21:43.450
Yeah, you know,
like Donald Duck,
Popeye, Superman.

21:43.552 --> 21:45.985
- He's not a real person?
- Who? Condorman?

21:46.087 --> 21:47.687
Yes, Condorman.

21:47.789 --> 21:51.040
No, Russ. Comic book characters
aren't real people. [chuckles]

21:51.142 --> 21:52.976
Not as a rule, anyway.
I mean, uh...

21:53.078 --> 21:57.647
Donald Duck, for example,
he's not a real duck,
just a drawing.

21:58.383 --> 22:01.618
Hmm. Interesting.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.253
Well, I don't know
how interesting it is,
I mean...

22:04.356 --> 22:07.190
...every kid knows that.
I've known it all my life.

22:07.292 --> 22:09.058
Haven't you ever read
a comic book?

22:09.160 --> 22:13.463
Harry, Condorman
is a real person.

22:13.565 --> 22:17.000
Well, if you say so, Russ.
I always thought
it was a cartoon.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.286
Uh, is that all you wanted
to talk to me about?

22:19.388 --> 22:23.990
Listen, Harry,
we have a Russian agent
who wants to defect.

22:24.093 --> 22:25.892
Now this Russian insists
that we use

22:25.994 --> 22:29.028
one particular agent of ours
to facilitate the defection.

22:29.114 --> 22:31.815
Apparently, they have
some kind of rapport.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.936
We have been given
the code name of the agent,
but we've never heard of it.

22:36.038 --> 22:41.107
Now, it's vital that we
find this man and use him
to handle this operation.

22:41.209 --> 22:43.543
I want you to go through
every file we've got

22:43.645 --> 22:47.815
and find out
who has been using
the code name Condorman.

22:52.220 --> 22:53.687
What's the matter?

22:53.789 --> 22:57.474
I think I know
who's been using that name.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.058
Are you serious?

22:59.111 --> 23:00.977
- Very.
- I could get killed.

23:01.079 --> 23:04.347
It's not a dangerous
operation, buddy,
just a simple defection.

23:04.450 --> 23:06.016
Simple defection
for you, maybe.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.184
I delivered simple papers
in Istanbul

23:08.287 --> 23:11.221
and nearly got shish-kebabed
by Turkish behemoths.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.056
Every precaution
is going to be taken.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.893
- The Bear is very
important to us.
- Bear? What bear?

23:15.994 --> 23:20.113
The Bear is the code name
for the Russian spy
who wants to defect.

23:20.215 --> 23:23.467
I'm sorry, fellas.
I refuse to place my
fragile life in jeopardy

23:23.569 --> 23:26.169
over anybody who goes
under the name of the Bear.

23:26.271 --> 23:29.072
Come on, Woody.
A little cloak,
a little dagger.

23:29.174 --> 23:32.342
Mr. Wilkins,
I feel certain patriotism
counts for something.

23:32.445 --> 23:35.479
Patriotism? Forget patriotism.
I have a family to think of.

23:35.581 --> 23:37.548
- Family?
- Gopher Boy, Sponge Man.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.618
Deadlines and things.
Condorman and Laser Lady
make their debut next week.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.454
Do you realize
we are talking about

23:43.556 --> 23:45.822
the most important
defection in this decade?

23:45.924 --> 23:47.791
[Woody] I'm not a spy!

23:50.078 --> 23:52.278
I'm sorry.

23:53.782 --> 23:55.849
I'm sorry.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.234
I'm sorry.

24:07.212 --> 24:10.830
Come on, Woody.
You won't even put
anything in the comics

24:10.933 --> 24:12.866
unless it's been
tested and proven.

24:12.968 --> 24:16.670
Well, now here's your
chance. Out of the inkwell
and into real life.

24:16.772 --> 24:20.707
It's the chance of
a lifetime. Whatever you're
dreaming up for Condorman,

24:20.809 --> 24:23.076
draw us the plans
and we'll do the rest.

24:23.178 --> 24:26.546
We can build anything
and deliver it anywhere
at our expense.

24:26.565 --> 24:30.516
Right, Russ?
Right, Russ?

24:30.619 --> 24:32.919
Mr. Wilkins, we wouldn't be
asking you to do this

24:33.021 --> 24:37.657
if it weren't for the fact
that the Bear insisted
upon you being the escort.

24:37.759 --> 24:39.876
How could the Bear
know about me?

24:39.995 --> 24:43.213
Because you've already
met her, in Istanbul.

24:44.883 --> 24:48.701
Natalia Rambova of the KGB.

24:50.939 --> 24:52.522
Natalia?

24:56.245 --> 24:57.477
[sighing]

24:57.579 --> 24:58.911
[Russ] Impossible.

24:59.013 --> 25:02.398
No. No, impossible.
Absolutely out
of the question.

25:02.500 --> 25:07.537
Now, hang on a minute.
You said you'd do this
in my way with my designs.

25:07.639 --> 25:10.941
[laughs] But this is
going to cost us a fortune.

25:11.043 --> 25:16.746
It's a tricky transfer,
I grant you, but can't you
simplify a little bit?

25:16.849 --> 25:20.317
Russ has a point.
He wants you to bring him
the Bear, not a comic book.

25:20.418 --> 25:25.922
OK, OK. If I don't
get the equipment,
I don't get the Bear.

25:26.024 --> 25:28.591
- Over to you, Russ.
- [sighs, clears throat]

25:28.693 --> 25:30.760
Well, I don't know.
I...

25:30.863 --> 25:34.831
Of course, if all else fails,
we are prepared, Russ.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.500
We could always go
to plan B.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.602
[sighs]

25:40.538 --> 25:42.472
OK.

25:42.574 --> 25:44.407
Get fabrication
on it immediately.

25:44.509 --> 25:47.911
- Right, Russ.
- I want you there
yesterday.

25:49.531 --> 25:51.748
Plan B.

25:53.318 --> 25:56.136
What's plan B,
Harry?

25:56.238 --> 25:58.105
I don't know.

25:58.206 --> 26:01.441
But I hope to have it
ready by the time
you get to Yugoslavia.

26:57.265 --> 26:58.698
Natalia.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.686
[groans]

27:14.750 --> 27:17.300
- Natalia.
- [branches rustling]

27:19.772 --> 27:21.687
Haaa!

27:23.241 --> 27:25.608
- Natalia.
- Yes. Yes.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.763
Condorman?

27:30.315 --> 27:31.714
Who else?

27:31.816 --> 27:33.816
I knew you would come.

27:33.918 --> 27:36.353
I hope you didn't mind
the gypsy disguise.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.688
I figured you'd look
good in anything.

27:40.342 --> 27:44.044
- We must hurry
before we're discovered.
- You're right. Come on.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.304
Come on.

28:02.314 --> 28:06.950
Take your time. Everything's
ready. We should be able
to leave the country...

28:07.052 --> 28:09.052
[man] Halt!

28:10.522 --> 28:11.805
[gasps]

28:12.523 --> 28:15.058
An escape as gypsies.

28:15.160 --> 28:18.828
How very romantic,
Comrade.

28:18.930 --> 28:21.581
And who is your
American friend?

28:25.636 --> 28:27.837
Put up your hands
and move over there.

28:27.939 --> 28:31.975
You don't understand.
I'm really on your side.
I'm a double agent.

28:32.077 --> 28:35.444
I was delivering some
secret information
to the Bear here.

28:35.546 --> 28:37.781
We're old Comrades
from Istanbul.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.550
- Is that your story, Comrade?
- Yes.

28:40.652 --> 28:44.070
Really? Krokov
will be most interested.

28:44.172 --> 28:46.957
He has suspected your
defection for some time.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.292
Boris.

28:49.394 --> 28:52.696
- Hand over your weapons.
- I don't have one.

28:52.797 --> 28:57.267
Condorman does not
carry a gun. It is
against my code.

28:57.369 --> 29:01.404
- What?
- Guns scare me. The noise.

29:01.506 --> 29:04.173
All I carry is
my trusty old cane.

29:27.249 --> 29:28.849
[gasping]

29:32.988 --> 29:35.088
Hoo!

29:35.190 --> 29:37.858
- Are you all right?
- That's a hair trigger.

29:37.960 --> 29:40.644
- Fastest cane in the West.
- Watch out!

29:40.746 --> 29:42.345
Oooh!

29:46.935 --> 29:48.602
Multipurpose.

29:48.704 --> 29:50.737
Come on.

29:50.839 --> 29:53.005
Right through here.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.081
You are not nervous, eh?

30:19.183 --> 30:21.217
Me, Condorman, nervous?

30:21.319 --> 30:22.986
No.

30:23.087 --> 30:25.371
- Watch out!
- Ah!

30:27.175 --> 30:29.442
It's OK. It's nothing
to worry about.

30:29.544 --> 30:31.945
Just testing
the steering mechanism.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.917
So, you decided
to defect?

30:38.020 --> 30:40.753
Oh, life has not been
very easy for me at home.

30:40.855 --> 30:43.089
It's been on my mind
for some time now.

30:43.191 --> 30:45.425
Why didn't you do it
from Istanbul?

30:45.527 --> 30:50.196
Something happened with
Krokov when I got back
that made my decision.

30:50.299 --> 30:52.198
I realized
it was now or never.

30:52.301 --> 30:55.101
- Krokov?
- The man those agents
talked about.

30:55.203 --> 31:01.390
This Krokov,
he isn't your husband
by any chance, is he?

31:01.492 --> 31:03.960
No. I am single woman.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.463
Free single woman.

31:08.633 --> 31:11.234
Well, I'm very glad
to hear that.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.771
I was thinking,
America is so far away,
you know.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.073
But you'll love it
when you get there.

31:17.225 --> 31:20.343
Fall in New England,
the Grand Canyon,

31:20.445 --> 31:23.479
New York, those buildings,
Thanksgiving,

31:23.581 --> 31:28.067
toasted marshmallows,
Sunday funnies,
the senior prom, baseball...

31:28.169 --> 31:30.153
[fades into distance]

31:40.698 --> 31:43.166
[dogs barking]

31:47.372 --> 31:50.039
[growling]

31:52.227 --> 31:55.094
But how did that happen?

31:55.196 --> 31:57.697
Look, I had two men
following them.

31:58.734 --> 32:01.167
What? No, no, no,
absolutely not.

32:01.269 --> 32:03.669
I want her alive.

32:03.771 --> 32:06.573
Death is far too good
for that little traitor.

32:06.675 --> 32:07.774
What?

32:07.876 --> 32:10.777
No. The man is expendable.

32:10.879 --> 32:14.013
Well, send out
the Brochnoviatch.

32:14.115 --> 32:17.667
And make sure
that Morovich is
personally in charge.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.753
[hangs up phone]

32:24.492 --> 32:26.609
[speaks Russian]

32:28.613 --> 32:31.014
...Brochnoviatch.

32:56.508 --> 32:58.625
[crowd chattering]

32:59.927 --> 33:01.761
[children shouting]

33:22.900 --> 33:25.435
[all fall quiet]

33:51.997 --> 33:54.697
[car engine revving in distance]

33:59.821 --> 34:02.705
[baby crying]

34:02.890 --> 34:04.240
[man] Brochnoviatch.

34:04.342 --> 34:07.877
- [bell tolls]
- [screaming, shouting]

34:23.311 --> 34:26.129
[dog barking]

35:02.968 --> 35:05.551
[speaks Russian]

35:23.854 --> 35:26.505
[tires squealing]

35:39.754 --> 35:43.723
It's like
a storybook town.
Just look at it.

35:43.825 --> 35:46.025
[Woody] So quiet.

35:46.127 --> 35:47.610
[Natalia] It's too quiet.

35:47.712 --> 35:50.045
What do you mean?

35:50.147 --> 35:52.732
The people.
Where are the people?

36:03.978 --> 36:09.581
Natalia, you gotta learn
to lighten up. Relax.

36:10.285 --> 36:12.418
Something is wrong.

36:17.508 --> 36:19.542
[speaks Russian]

36:20.428 --> 36:22.611
[engines roar]

36:46.788 --> 36:50.056
Krokov will do anything
to get me back.

36:50.158 --> 36:53.892
Forget Krokov.
You're with me now.

37:16.667 --> 37:19.835
- Natalia.
- What is it?

37:19.938 --> 37:22.071
You tell me.

37:25.360 --> 37:27.293
The Brochnoviatch.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.924
We cannot outrun them
in this old truck.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.993
You have a point there.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.728
But...

37:45.830 --> 37:47.664
[gasps]

37:59.026 --> 38:00.727
Incredible.

38:20.898 --> 38:22.715
Fantastic.

38:40.769 --> 38:46.205
- What do we do now?
- Well, we push
another button.

39:00.488 --> 39:02.054
I don't believe it.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.537
Who are those guys?

39:18.639 --> 39:21.841
The Brochnoviatch
is the KGB pursuit squadron.

39:21.943 --> 39:25.911
Superb drivers,
and each one is
a dedicated killer.

39:41.663 --> 39:43.029
Look out!

39:51.539 --> 39:53.038
[tires screeching]

40:02.967 --> 40:06.802
OK, OK. Let's
warm things up a bit.

40:37.201 --> 40:40.219
- Do something.
- There's nothing
left to do.

40:43.874 --> 40:45.824
Stop! He's crazy.
He will kill us.

40:45.927 --> 40:48.094
Stop, nothing.
That's what he wants.

40:48.179 --> 40:50.612
[beeping]

40:54.602 --> 40:56.368
[screams]

41:06.498 --> 41:08.731
[tires squealing]

41:20.378 --> 41:21.911
[engine idling]

41:44.318 --> 41:47.119
[engine roaring]

42:06.324 --> 42:07.756
[crashing]

42:23.240 --> 42:25.073
It's Morovich.

42:25.175 --> 42:28.661
- You know that guy?
- He's a homicidal maniac.

42:38.172 --> 42:42.925
- You've got to stop him.
- Of course.
The trick is how.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.483
[man shouts]

42:57.091 --> 42:59.224
- [screams]
- [man yells]

43:01.295 --> 43:02.895
[people shouting]

43:21.616 --> 43:22.915
[woman shouting]

43:28.673 --> 43:31.490
[air hissing]

43:55.232 --> 43:58.066
Escaped?
And in a gypsy truck?

43:58.168 --> 44:01.136
- It turned into a racecar.
- But you had the Brochnoviatch.

44:01.238 --> 44:04.540
Before my eye,
the racecar turned into
an hydrofoil.

44:04.642 --> 44:08.043
Have you seen this report
on this Condorman,
on this man Wilkins?

44:08.145 --> 44:12.831
He is an amateur, do you hear?
He is not an agent of the CIA.

44:12.933 --> 44:15.367
He is a writer
of comic books.

44:15.469 --> 44:17.970
We shall be
a laughingstock back home.

44:28.132 --> 44:30.199
Comrade, please,

44:30.301 --> 44:34.769
all I ask is one more chance
to get at this Condorman.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.844
All right,
my dear Morovich.

44:44.482 --> 44:46.415
You will get the chance.

44:47.969 --> 44:52.037
According
to my calculations,

44:52.139 --> 44:56.775
he should land somewhere
on the north coast of Italy.

44:58.379 --> 45:00.145
[growls]

45:16.230 --> 45:19.731
Around about there
should be the place.

45:19.834 --> 45:22.784
- Vito.
- Yes, Comrade Commissar.

45:24.288 --> 45:26.588
Contact Barrazini.

45:26.690 --> 45:29.725
We are collecting
an old debt.

45:29.827 --> 45:32.294
Tell him what we want.

45:34.832 --> 45:37.365
- [Woody] Not far to go.
- [panting]

45:37.468 --> 45:40.903
- [Natalia] Where are we?
- I don't know.

45:41.004 --> 45:44.907
But don't worry.
We're safe and clear now.

45:45.008 --> 45:48.644
- How can you say that?
- It's logic.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.746
If we don't know
where we are,

45:50.848 --> 45:53.782
it stands to reason
Krokov doesn't know, either.

45:53.884 --> 45:56.985
I doubt whether
he'd have us
followed into Italy.

45:57.087 --> 46:01.223
- Hey.
- You don't know Krokov.

46:01.325 --> 46:04.976
Hey, that'll be perfect.
Come on.

46:07.815 --> 46:10.216
[dog barking]

46:14.622 --> 46:19.525
Oh, this'll be fine.
We'll sleep here and get an
early start in the morning.

46:19.627 --> 46:22.627
Tomorrow I'll find
a telephone, call Harry

46:22.730 --> 46:25.130
and we'll be home
in no time.

46:30.471 --> 46:32.370
[frogs croaking]

46:35.926 --> 46:37.993
[birds calling]

46:48.456 --> 46:50.755
[mooing]

46:54.595 --> 46:55.878
[door crashes]

46:58.432 --> 46:59.999
[shouts in Italian]

47:00.101 --> 47:02.284
On your feet.
You are under arrest.

47:03.220 --> 47:06.271
Uh,<i> senor.</i>
Uh, excusee.

47:06.373 --> 47:08.206
Uh, there's been a mistake.

47:08.308 --> 47:11.877
You have got
the wrong couple.<i> Comprende?</i>

47:11.979 --> 47:14.713
- You must do something.
- How can I do something?

47:14.815 --> 47:17.816
Obviously, he's got us mixed up
with another couple.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.525
[Natalia] It said we killed
a man in Monte Carlo.

47:27.628 --> 47:31.963
In Monte Carlo?
We've never even been
to Monte Carlo.

47:32.065 --> 47:34.199
Krokov is behind this.

47:34.301 --> 47:36.367
Look, guard.

47:36.470 --> 47:39.538
Guard, you really are
making a big mistake.

47:39.640 --> 47:43.725
The authorities
from Monte Carlo
are on their way.

47:43.827 --> 47:46.211
Krokov's men.

47:46.313 --> 47:48.680
- You know what I think?
- What?

47:48.782 --> 47:52.084
I think we're
in serious trouble.

47:52.186 --> 47:54.752
Gopher Boy,
what would you do now?

47:54.855 --> 47:56.488
What?

47:57.724 --> 47:59.591
Aw, nothing.

48:00.927 --> 48:02.560
Nothing.

48:06.200 --> 48:07.165
[door bangs]

48:07.267 --> 48:08.900
[knocking]

48:12.373 --> 48:14.406
[speaks French]

48:21.465 --> 48:23.598
[man] Wake up.

48:24.735 --> 48:26.785
Bring your things.

48:33.493 --> 48:36.761
Hey, fella.
You think this is it?

48:36.864 --> 48:39.464
You think you got us
licked? Huh?

48:39.566 --> 48:41.800
The world isn't
a vacuum, you know.

48:41.902 --> 48:45.337
You mark this.
I'm an American citizen.

48:45.439 --> 48:49.875
You no speaka the English,
huh? No understando meo?

48:51.678 --> 48:54.312
What language
do they speak in Monaco?

48:54.414 --> 48:59.017
Hey, ugly American.
Remember plan B?
This is it.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.387
Harry?

49:10.097 --> 49:11.497
This?

49:11.598 --> 49:13.581
Get in.

49:15.585 --> 49:17.418
Have you got the key?

49:17.521 --> 49:20.288
Not now.
We're being watched
by you know who.

49:20.390 --> 49:23.725
Besides, the Russkies
can't be far behind.

49:23.827 --> 49:27.195
You're all over
the front page.

49:27.297 --> 49:30.932
- Does Russ know about this?
- He's working on
the rest of the plan.

49:31.035 --> 49:33.101
<i> Bazooka Boy</i>
<i> Meets Hannibal Smith.</i>

49:33.203 --> 49:35.503
Great.
One of my favorites.

49:53.858 --> 49:56.591
- OK, give me the keys.
- Let's get
out of here first.

49:56.693 --> 49:58.893
Stop. It's Morovich.

49:58.995 --> 50:01.146
[speaking Russian]

50:04.501 --> 50:06.551
Get out of here, fast.

50:11.124 --> 50:13.659
[shouting in Russian]

50:32.997 --> 50:34.930
[shouting in Russian]

50:46.142 --> 50:47.809
There.

50:53.550 --> 50:55.684
Down there.

50:57.971 --> 51:00.255
Ooh!

51:00.357 --> 51:02.324
Harry, the keys.

51:02.426 --> 51:04.926
- [panting] OK.
- Come on.

51:07.014 --> 51:08.947
- Oh!
- Ah!

51:11.785 --> 51:13.451
Ha ha ha.

51:15.789 --> 51:17.990
- OK?
- Uh-huh.

51:21.845 --> 51:24.379
[speaking Russian]

51:34.291 --> 51:38.243
- [speaking Russian]
- [man speaking Italian]

51:39.897 --> 51:42.014
[organ playing]

51:44.919 --> 51:48.186
[man continues in Italian]

52:03.304 --> 52:05.604
I wish to speak.

52:05.706 --> 52:07.739
Yes?

52:09.476 --> 52:11.642
- This man is
already married.
- [gasping]

52:11.745 --> 52:14.163
And to whom
is this man married?

52:14.265 --> 52:16.130
To me.

52:17.233 --> 52:20.034
[man] What is this?
I never saw her before.

52:21.304 --> 52:26.157
Come home, Pietro,
please. For the sake
of the children.

52:26.259 --> 52:29.444
You are lying.
She's nothing but a liar.

52:29.546 --> 52:32.414
- She's crazy.
- I wish I was.

52:32.516 --> 52:37.201
- Pietro Junior
cries for his father.
- You will leave here at once.

52:37.304 --> 52:41.206
I will not. Uncle Luigi and I
have come to take you home.

52:41.308 --> 52:44.158
I will
throw her out myself.

52:44.260 --> 52:46.427
Don't you
lay a hand on me.

52:46.530 --> 52:49.864
- Who will stop me?
- Uncle Luigi.

52:49.966 --> 52:53.635
I will squeeze the truth
out of this Uncle Luigi.

52:54.672 --> 52:57.138
[crowd gasping, shouting]

53:24.267 --> 53:27.752
[Morovich] We believe
they are headed
in the direction of...

53:27.904 --> 53:31.556
- The Alps.
- That's what we suspect.

53:31.659 --> 53:36.461
In which case, they could
cross at any one of
a number of places.

53:36.563 --> 53:40.398
Near Mont Blanc,
through Saint Bernard Pass,
below...

53:40.500 --> 53:45.187
- I know exactly
where they will cross.
- You do?

53:45.289 --> 53:48.156
The best kept secrets
of Woodrow Wilkins

53:48.258 --> 53:50.659
can be found
by any small child

53:50.761 --> 53:53.995
for the price
of a tiny coin.

53:56.533 --> 54:01.469
Here is a truck that
turns into a racing car.

54:01.572 --> 54:05.306
Here, a car that turns
into a hovercraft.

54:06.309 --> 54:08.743
Ingenious weapons.

54:08.845 --> 54:11.345
Exploding rockets.

54:11.448 --> 54:13.181
It's all here.

54:13.283 --> 54:15.416
Including, my friend...

54:20.423 --> 54:23.524
<i> Bazooka Boy Meets</i>
<i> Hannibal Smith?</i>

54:23.627 --> 54:25.860
Where they will
cross the Alps.

54:34.755 --> 54:37.155
[bells jingling]

54:46.132 --> 54:49.368
Hey, hey. Whoa!

54:49.470 --> 54:51.436
Well, here it is.
We made it.

54:51.538 --> 54:55.507
- At last, a real inn
with hot water.
- And food.

54:55.609 --> 54:58.259
Well, we'll stay here
the night, but in one room.

54:58.412 --> 55:00.645
- We mustn't separate.
- Right.

55:07.421 --> 55:10.088
What is this?
Why are all these
children looking at us?

55:10.190 --> 55:13.825
Well, it's out of season.
Maybe they're just glad
to see tourists.

55:13.927 --> 55:15.960
- Hi, there.
- [speaks Italian]

55:17.831 --> 55:22.634
That's your room.
I hope you are
very happy here.

55:22.736 --> 55:25.437
- Bedroom for two.
- Two people. Yes, sir.

55:25.539 --> 55:28.707
- Two peoples.
- Arrivederci. Bye.

55:29.676 --> 55:33.177
- Two peoples.
- [laughing]

55:33.280 --> 55:37.282
Oh, I can feel that hot water
from that shower already.

55:37.384 --> 55:40.051
Uh, unless... I could
feel it later if...

55:40.153 --> 55:42.487
- Be my guest.
- Thanks a lot.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.112
[all whispering]

56:37.160 --> 56:39.461
You are her, aren't you?

56:39.563 --> 56:42.063
- Of course it's her.
- It is.

56:42.165 --> 56:44.366
- It isn't.
- It is.

56:44.501 --> 56:48.303
What is this?
Why are you children
staring at me?

56:48.405 --> 56:53.341
The empress of space,
time and beauty,

56:54.411 --> 56:55.843
Laser Lady.

57:06.874 --> 57:09.841
How did you get to be
Laser Lady?

57:15.465 --> 57:17.232
[exhales]

57:19.802 --> 57:21.802
You scared the dickens
out of me.

57:21.904 --> 57:25.640
I turned around and you're gone,
Woody's out like a light.

57:25.742 --> 57:30.178
I figured, boom, that's it.
They heard the shower
running and they grabbed you.

57:31.314 --> 57:34.382
Natalia?
Are you all right?

57:34.484 --> 57:36.784
Yes, yes,
I'm all right.

57:37.820 --> 57:39.987
Harry, who are you?

57:41.591 --> 57:45.326
- What do you mean?
- Woody is Condorman.

57:45.428 --> 57:47.746
I am Laser Lady.
Who are you?

57:50.834 --> 57:52.483
How'd you find out?

57:52.585 --> 57:55.302
The children here
read comic books, too.

57:59.192 --> 58:01.977
Let's take
a little walk.

58:06.266 --> 58:08.533
I knew you'd find out
sooner or later.

58:08.635 --> 58:11.302
But I held my peace
because of Woody.

58:11.404 --> 58:14.138
It's all my fault.
I got him into this.

58:14.240 --> 58:17.876
[traditional music playing]

58:18.979 --> 58:21.179
[bells jingling]

58:54.681 --> 58:57.182
- Whoo!
- [cheering]

59:04.274 --> 59:06.207
Wow.

59:06.309 --> 59:08.577
No wonder they can eat
so much pasta.

59:08.679 --> 59:10.060
[woman] Harry.

59:10.163 --> 59:14.548
- [speaks Italian]
- Listen, I...

59:14.650 --> 59:16.885
When you got it,
you got it.

59:21.891 --> 59:23.458
[chuckles]

59:25.262 --> 59:26.727
[sighs]

59:32.436 --> 59:34.319
A ruble
for your thoughts.

59:42.845 --> 59:45.579
When I parted from Krokov,

59:45.681 --> 59:48.733
I promised myself
I would never love again

59:48.835 --> 59:51.485
a man who lived
a life of deception.

59:53.290 --> 59:56.024
But now...

59:56.126 --> 1:00:01.379
Now I think there is
deception and deception.

1:00:03.166 --> 1:00:08.103
- I don't understand.
- But I do. [chuckles]

1:00:08.205 --> 1:00:12.873
When I go to America
and start reading
the Sunday funnies

1:00:12.976 --> 1:00:15.110
and eating my Big Mac

1:00:15.212 --> 1:00:17.112
and planning
for the senior prom...

1:00:17.214 --> 1:00:18.879
You may have missed
the prom.

1:00:18.982 --> 1:00:21.015
I would like it very much

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:23.918
if I could pick up
my American telephone,

1:00:24.020 --> 1:00:27.155
call my friend Woody
and say,

1:00:27.257 --> 1:00:30.758
"Come over and be
democratic with me."

1:00:30.860 --> 1:00:34.212
I'll bring the dip if you
bring the Dostoevsky.

1:00:36.516 --> 1:00:38.849
That's a yes.

1:00:41.922 --> 1:00:43.654
[shuffling]

1:00:49.029 --> 1:00:51.829
[wind blowing]

1:00:52.698 --> 1:00:54.232
[deep exhale]

1:00:58.604 --> 1:01:00.738
What are we doing
up here?

1:01:00.840 --> 1:01:05.443
You see that?
That's our first-class
ticket to freedom.

1:01:09.966 --> 1:01:12.133
This is it.

1:01:13.970 --> 1:01:17.138
Aw, good old Russ.
He got it exactly right.

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:18.572
- He did?
- What is it?

1:01:18.674 --> 1:01:21.976
They're jet rods,
and as with the other one,

1:01:22.078 --> 1:01:27.966
you just hook it up there
on the cable, like so.

1:01:30.253 --> 1:01:34.138
Then you open up
the stirrups, climb aboard,

1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:37.274
and when you're ready
to go, you pull that lever

1:01:37.376 --> 1:01:39.327
and zowie
right up the mountain.

1:01:39.429 --> 1:01:41.579
Whoa. Hold on.

1:01:41.681 --> 1:01:44.265
Harry, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

1:01:44.367 --> 1:01:46.868
Uh, Woody,
I can't handle heights.

1:01:46.969 --> 1:01:49.771
OK, you climb on
with me and hold on.

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:52.656
Whoa.

1:01:54.894 --> 1:01:56.828
Ready?

1:01:58.597 --> 1:02:00.782
OK.

1:02:06.172 --> 1:02:08.572
[rocket firing]

1:03:14.390 --> 1:03:16.757
Morovich.

1:03:16.809 --> 1:03:19.677
<i> [Krokov on radio]</i>
<i> You see them?</i>

1:03:19.779 --> 1:03:21.412
<i> Da.</i>

1:03:34.027 --> 1:03:35.093
Shoot.

1:03:40.050 --> 1:03:41.882
Woody!

1:03:41.984 --> 1:03:45.853
[Natalia screams] Woody!

1:03:56.466 --> 1:04:00.385
[screams]
Don't you touch me, you...

1:04:00.487 --> 1:04:02.637
[grunting]

1:04:07.410 --> 1:04:09.410
[shouts]

1:04:51.421 --> 1:04:53.554
I think they're gone.

1:04:55.191 --> 1:04:57.324
We can move now.

1:04:58.428 --> 1:05:04.598
I may never
move again.

1:05:22.251 --> 1:05:26.787
Good morning, Natalia.
I trust you slept well.

1:05:26.889 --> 1:05:30.958
Surely you don't think
I'd let you get away after
all you've meant to me.

1:05:31.060 --> 1:05:32.844
I hate you.

1:05:34.497 --> 1:05:37.732
And I wished to kill you.

1:05:40.403 --> 1:05:42.720
You don't know
how tempted I was.

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:45.706
I wish you would have.

1:05:45.809 --> 1:05:47.958
Anything would have been
better than this.

1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:50.410
Save your tears.

1:05:50.513 --> 1:05:53.014
I am going
to save your life.

1:05:53.116 --> 1:05:55.883
Our story will be that
you pretended to defect

1:05:55.985 --> 1:05:58.385
in order to kidnap
this Condorman.

1:05:58.487 --> 1:06:03.524
I shall lay the blame
on Morovich for failing
his mission.

1:06:03.626 --> 1:06:05.793
Of course, he will
have to be killed.

1:06:05.895 --> 1:06:09.931
We can't have the party
hearing his side
of the story, can we?

1:06:10.033 --> 1:06:15.369
You pig. Do you really think
that things will be
the same between us?

1:06:15.471 --> 1:06:17.371
For the moment
I don't care.

1:06:17.473 --> 1:06:20.607
But, remember, Natalia,
whatever happens
in the future

1:06:20.710 --> 1:06:25.213
is better than a slow death
in a Siberian slave farm.

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:27.448
Don't touch me.

1:06:28.017 --> 1:06:30.000
Very well.

1:06:30.102 --> 1:06:35.089
But for the moment things
will have to appear as
normal between ourselves.

1:06:35.191 --> 1:06:37.825
You will have
to play the role
of perfect hostess,

1:06:37.927 --> 1:06:39.861
a role
you were born for.

1:06:39.963 --> 1:06:41.929
And if you have
any design on escape,

1:06:42.031 --> 1:06:45.933
this comfortable villa is
an impregnable fortress.

1:06:46.035 --> 1:06:50.137
Your every move will be
watched. The oil ministers
arrive tomorrow.

1:06:50.240 --> 1:06:52.306
I want you up and about,
looking your best,

1:06:52.408 --> 1:06:56.978
laughing and ensuring
they are happy. Hmm?

1:06:57.080 --> 1:06:59.513
Get out of here!

1:06:59.615 --> 1:07:02.516
That's better.
That's the spirit.

1:07:03.886 --> 1:07:06.787
I will leave you now
for a moment to...

1:07:06.890 --> 1:07:10.558
...get your redemption
into your head.

1:07:17.133 --> 1:07:19.066
And, Natalia, remember,

1:07:19.168 --> 1:07:23.570
any more trouble from you
and I shall personally
kill you immediately.

1:07:30.897 --> 1:07:32.596
[Harry] Woody.

1:07:37.236 --> 1:07:40.103
- I just talked to Russ.
- Natalia?

1:07:40.206 --> 1:07:43.106
Krokov's got her
at the Russian villa
in Monte Carlo.

1:07:43.209 --> 1:07:46.711
- We've gotta get her
out of there.
- Woody.

1:07:46.813 --> 1:07:50.364
We've been ordered back
to Paris. The mission's
considered a bust.

1:07:50.466 --> 1:07:54.569
I can't go back.
Not without Natalia.

1:07:55.905 --> 1:07:57.355
I love her, Harry.

1:07:58.607 --> 1:07:59.540
I know.

1:07:59.642 --> 1:08:01.492
[Woody] I still have
top red clearance.

1:08:01.594 --> 1:08:05.095
That gives me anything I need,
including Fort Knox. Right?

1:08:05.198 --> 1:08:08.632
Now, wait. That was
before we were ordered
back to Paris, Woody.

1:08:08.734 --> 1:08:12.152
Forget orders. Tell them
you didn't see me in time,
it was too late.

1:08:12.254 --> 1:08:17.174
- I can't do that, Woody.
- Harry, two days,
that's all I ask.

1:08:17.977 --> 1:08:19.460
Two days.

1:08:20.380 --> 1:08:22.046
[Woody] Please.

1:08:24.150 --> 1:08:26.500
OK, buddy, you got it.

1:08:27.253 --> 1:08:29.069
Harry, you're beautiful.

1:08:29.171 --> 1:08:30.938
Will you stop?
People will talk.

1:08:31.040 --> 1:08:33.073
Now, here's
what I have in mind.

1:09:05.858 --> 1:09:07.925
- Hello, Sergei.
- Hello, Henri.

1:09:08.027 --> 1:09:10.660
- What happened?
- Amazing, Sergei, amazing.

1:09:10.763 --> 1:09:13.397
This Arab,
he took the house
to their limit.

1:09:13.499 --> 1:09:16.166
- What is that?
- Five million francs.

1:09:30.617 --> 1:09:31.899
[Krokov] Who is that man?

1:09:32.001 --> 1:09:33.434
According
to the underground,

1:09:33.536 --> 1:09:35.903
he was nothing more
than another Bedouin.

1:09:36.005 --> 1:09:39.373
Then several months ago
he struck oil

1:09:39.475 --> 1:09:44.612
and now... now he's
the seventh richest man
in the world.

1:09:44.714 --> 1:09:47.281
Make sure he is
at tomorrow's party.

1:09:58.461 --> 1:10:01.145
[upbeat instrumental music]

1:10:16.912 --> 1:10:22.850
But the question remains,
can we produce it
in sufficient quantity?

1:10:22.952 --> 1:10:25.853
Now, do you see that as
a problem in the long run?

1:10:25.955 --> 1:10:27.672
[man] That all depends.

1:10:29.425 --> 1:10:31.959
What was your question
again, huh?

1:10:32.061 --> 1:10:33.661
Well, actually,
what I said was,

1:10:33.730 --> 1:10:36.597
do you think our North Sea
will produce enough oil?

1:10:36.699 --> 1:10:38.466
North Sea? Ha!

1:10:38.568 --> 1:10:40.834
A Caesar salad's worth.

1:10:40.936 --> 1:10:42.870
Pardon me, please.

1:10:42.972 --> 1:10:47.675
Business. I have to close
a deal for Rhode Island.

1:10:48.878 --> 1:10:50.678
[snorts]

1:10:50.780 --> 1:10:52.913
Amazing.

1:10:53.015 --> 1:10:54.882
[crowd chattering]

1:11:03.226 --> 1:11:06.393
- So?
- Everything's go.

1:11:06.495 --> 1:11:08.495
- You talk to her yet?
- I can't get near her.

1:11:08.597 --> 1:11:12.133
Every time I turn around,
someone tries
to sell me something.

1:11:12.235 --> 1:11:15.903
Whatever you do, don't buy.
When are you gonna
make your move?

1:11:16.005 --> 1:11:17.638
Hey.

1:11:21.110 --> 1:11:23.778
Right, I'm gonna try
and get to her now.

1:11:23.880 --> 1:11:26.981
You give me five minutes,
then let it go, OK?

1:11:27.083 --> 1:11:29.283
- OK. Five minutes.
- [wine splashing]

1:11:29.385 --> 1:11:31.485
Don't worry about me.

1:11:42.381 --> 1:11:44.114
[snorts]

1:11:44.750 --> 1:11:46.384
[applause]

1:12:06.722 --> 1:12:09.022
[Woody in faked voice]
Enchanting.

1:12:12.161 --> 1:12:15.629
A beautiful place,
Monaco.

1:12:15.732 --> 1:12:18.899
Yes, it is.
I do not believe we have met.

1:12:19.001 --> 1:12:20.935
Natalia Rambova.

1:12:22.204 --> 1:12:24.905
Don't scream out.
The cavalry's here.

1:12:25.007 --> 1:12:26.474
- [gasps]
- No.

1:12:26.576 --> 1:12:30.310
Woody. They told me
you were dead.

1:12:30.413 --> 1:12:33.613
I've come to get you.
Come on.

1:12:33.716 --> 1:12:35.849
[Natalia] No.

1:12:35.951 --> 1:12:38.585
I cannot go with you.

1:12:38.687 --> 1:12:40.921
What do you mean?

1:12:47.096 --> 1:12:49.930
I'm sorry,
but I've changed my mind.

1:12:50.048 --> 1:12:53.901
You've changed your mind?
Are you crazy?

1:12:54.003 --> 1:12:58.839
This isn't like deciding
what restaurant to eat in.
This is a defection.

1:12:59.024 --> 1:13:01.926
- It's Krokov.
- Krokov? Forget Krokov.

1:13:02.027 --> 1:13:04.795
- Now, come with me.
- No, no. Krokov...

1:13:09.318 --> 1:13:14.020
Krokov had a plan.
It was a plan.
Don't be stupid.

1:13:15.357 --> 1:13:18.158
Krokov thought you were
a top American agent.

1:13:18.260 --> 1:13:21.428
My defection was a ruse
to kidnap you,

1:13:21.530 --> 1:13:23.263
but now we know
you are nothing

1:13:23.365 --> 1:13:26.333
but a foolish dreamer
who draws comic books,

1:13:26.435 --> 1:13:28.935
not worth the bullet
to kill you.

1:13:30.606 --> 1:13:33.173
So go now, please,
and don't try to do anything.

1:13:33.275 --> 1:13:35.875
I see you've already
met the sheik.

1:13:35.978 --> 1:13:38.078
Yes.

1:13:38.180 --> 1:13:40.447
He thought
we had met before.

1:13:41.734 --> 1:13:43.501
Is that so?

1:13:44.870 --> 1:13:47.921
But I was mistaken.

1:13:50.593 --> 1:13:52.759
A foolish dream,
perhaps.

1:14:01.503 --> 1:14:05.723
It was a pleasure
meeting you. I'm sorry
we did not have more time.

1:14:05.825 --> 1:14:08.058
[Natalia]
Some other day, perhaps.

1:14:12.114 --> 1:14:15.048
If you bring the dip,
I'll bring the Dostoevsky.

1:14:23.058 --> 1:14:25.459
[sniffling]

1:14:31.367 --> 1:14:33.567
I'll bring the dip.

1:14:36.338 --> 1:14:38.539
I'll bring the dip.

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:41.559
Natalia.

1:14:43.896 --> 1:14:47.848
Three, two, one...

1:14:49.668 --> 1:14:51.402
[screaming]

1:14:52.187 --> 1:14:55.105
[alarm sounding]

1:14:58.093 --> 1:15:00.360
Come on. This way.

1:15:03.566 --> 1:15:05.165
[all shouting]

1:15:15.527 --> 1:15:16.577
Natalia.

1:15:20.166 --> 1:15:22.082
After them.

1:15:25.104 --> 1:15:26.236
[alarm siren]

1:15:26.338 --> 1:15:28.505
Downstairs. Quick.

1:15:38.935 --> 1:15:40.216
Good, Harry.

1:15:45.724 --> 1:15:46.991
[man shouts in Russian]

1:15:54.416 --> 1:15:55.799
- Halt.
- Halt.

1:15:55.901 --> 1:15:57.635
Coming through.

1:16:01.557 --> 1:16:02.789
[gunshots]

1:16:04.376 --> 1:16:06.793
Oh, Russ,
if you could see me now.

1:16:27.299 --> 1:16:29.066
There's no key.

1:16:29.168 --> 1:16:31.818
Quick, give me a hand.

1:16:38.827 --> 1:16:40.761
[alarm siren]

1:16:47.586 --> 1:16:51.171
- [Natalia] We're trapped.
- [Woody] Don't you
believe it.

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:54.424
Woody, I'm frightened.

1:16:54.526 --> 1:16:59.079
Don't worry. Condorman
has it all figured out.

1:16:59.181 --> 1:17:01.899
But how can we escape?
Fly?

1:17:08.290 --> 1:17:11.709
- You are not serious.
- You want out?

1:17:17.332 --> 1:17:19.499
I want you.

1:17:19.601 --> 1:17:23.103
Then get behind me
and hold on tight.

1:17:23.205 --> 1:17:24.888
[crashing]

1:17:54.987 --> 1:17:58.421
Morovich,
prepare them.

1:18:22.514 --> 1:18:24.081
[Harry] Uh-oh.

1:18:32.991 --> 1:18:34.824
[honking]

1:18:38.213 --> 1:18:39.963
[honking]

1:18:50.376 --> 1:18:53.359
Woody, I can't
hold on much longer.

1:18:53.462 --> 1:18:55.295
When are we
going to land?

1:18:55.397 --> 1:18:58.098
As soon as I see Harry
at the rendezvous.

1:19:06.792 --> 1:19:08.692
[honking]

1:19:20.055 --> 1:19:23.890
You beauty. You doll.
We made it.

1:19:34.786 --> 1:19:37.337
Oh, no.

1:19:40.459 --> 1:19:42.342
Somebody stop that car.

1:19:51.587 --> 1:19:53.319
[Harry groaning]

1:20:00.529 --> 1:20:05.665
Well, Russ,
easy come, easy go.

1:20:20.899 --> 1:20:23.033
OK. Here we go.

1:20:37.599 --> 1:20:39.032
Yeah.

1:20:39.134 --> 1:20:40.400
Yeah.

1:20:44.022 --> 1:20:45.289
Yeah, yeah.

1:20:49.495 --> 1:20:51.411
[chuckles]

1:20:51.513 --> 1:20:53.764
On the boat, Natalia.

1:20:57.369 --> 1:20:59.269
Let's go.

1:21:03.976 --> 1:21:07.176
Why did you come and get me?
You could have left me
at the villa.

1:21:07.278 --> 1:21:09.579
Why did you pretend
you didn't wanna come?

1:21:09.681 --> 1:21:11.982
I could not let you
be discovered and killed.

1:21:12.084 --> 1:21:15.218
If I had asked you
to help me, you'd have
done something stupid.

1:21:15.320 --> 1:21:18.154
Instead of the sane
and sensible thing
we're doing.

1:21:18.256 --> 1:21:20.473
Yeah, but how do you
feel about my being

1:21:20.626 --> 1:21:23.192
a foolish dreamer
who draws comic books,
huh?

1:21:23.294 --> 1:21:25.795
- Did I say that?
- Uh-huh.

1:21:25.897 --> 1:21:29.465
Laser Lady would say anything
to save the man she loves.

1:21:31.003 --> 1:21:33.954
[whistling]
Will you two come on?

1:21:37.809 --> 1:21:39.960
Come on, down.

1:22:15.080 --> 1:22:16.179
Now.

1:22:19.701 --> 1:22:21.218
[speaks Russian]

1:23:30.305 --> 1:23:32.338
[Woody] Harry,
change places with me.

1:23:32.440 --> 1:23:34.107
[Harry] Right.

1:23:39.864 --> 1:23:42.715
I thought I'd never
get to use you, baby.

1:23:57.416 --> 1:23:59.766
- Hit the smoke.
- [Harry] Gotcha.

1:25:49.911 --> 1:25:51.727
[engine sputtering]

1:25:57.852 --> 1:26:01.304
- Let's head for home.
- [Harry] Nice shootin',
Woody.

1:26:27.682 --> 1:26:31.751
I hate to say this,
but we're in serious trouble.

1:27:19.717 --> 1:27:21.484
Head for sky-lift.

1:27:38.102 --> 1:27:42.488
Return to base.
Return to base.

1:27:51.049 --> 1:27:53.717
He's gonna ram us.
Take it up.

1:27:56.938 --> 1:27:58.888
[screams]

1:28:13.855 --> 1:28:15.739

1:28:32.657 --> 1:28:36.442
Natalia,
you brought us luck.
I could kiss you.

1:28:43.885 --> 1:28:47.987
Not bad, Condorman.
We should go to more
baseball games.

1:28:48.089 --> 1:28:51.390
Yeah. I'll get us
season tickets.

1:28:51.492 --> 1:28:55.494
Hey, you two lovebirds,
do you mind? I'm trying
to watch the ball game.

1:28:55.596 --> 1:28:57.197
[chuckling]

1:28:58.266 --> 1:28:59.332
Uh...

1:28:59.434 --> 1:29:02.135
Natalia, look up.

1:29:02.320 --> 1:29:04.920
[Harry] It's my little
American present to you.

[Natalia gasps]

1:29:14.432 --> 1:29:17.817
Oh, my own little airship.

1:29:17.919 --> 1:29:19.218
Harry.

1:29:20.354 --> 1:29:22.154
Thank you.

1:29:26.094 --> 1:29:29.579
- [man] So that's them, huh?
- [Russ] Yes, sir. That's them.

1:29:29.681 --> 1:29:32.348
This is nothing but trouble.
If you want my advice...

1:29:32.450 --> 1:29:36.452
This assignment is very
delicate. It needs handling
with great finesse.

1:29:36.554 --> 1:29:39.756
That's what I mean, sir.
I don't think this man
is qualified.

1:29:39.807 --> 1:29:42.124
Nonsense. He got
the girl out, didn't he?

1:29:42.226 --> 1:29:44.677
- Do it.
- [Russ] Right away.

1:29:46.914 --> 1:29:48.864
Set it up.

1:29:48.966 --> 1:29:51.133
I'll get right on it.

1:29:54.071 --> 1:29:56.306
Hey, Woody,
you're a good old boy

1:29:56.408 --> 1:29:58.841
and I've got a wonderful
proposition for you.

1:29:58.943 --> 1:30:02.578
Have you ever thought
of taking Condorman to...
