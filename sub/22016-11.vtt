WEBVTT

00:01.066 --> 00:05.153
Okay, Joey,
you take this club,
and you hit that ball.

00:05.220 --> 00:07.272
Any questions?
Why does this say "Manny"?

00:07.340 --> 00:10.158
Don't worry about it.
They were only used once.

00:10.226 --> 00:12.376
It was a swing and a miss
for both of us.

00:12.444 --> 00:15.930
I needed to find
a way to spend
more quality time with Joe.

00:15.998 --> 00:18.033
I couldn't take
another Saturday
of hide-and-seek.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.634
At this point,
I've spent more time

00:19.701 --> 00:21.169
in the closet than Mitchell.

00:22.438 --> 00:24.055
Golf is
a very complicated sport.

00:24.123 --> 00:26.441
I don't want you to get
frustrated if you don't...

00:27.493 --> 00:28.993
Holy cow!

00:29.061 --> 00:30.362
Do you think
you can do that again?

00:30.430 --> 00:31.496
Yeah. It's easy.

00:31.647 --> 00:33.214
Okay, Mr. Cocky.

00:33.299 --> 00:35.850
You know, there is a thing
called beginner's...

00:35.918 --> 00:37.785
What the hell?

00:37.854 --> 00:39.004
Hey, Brady.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.406
Hey, Jay, what's up?
Oh, is this your grandson?

00:41.474 --> 00:42.790
I can't do this again.
This is my son.

00:42.858 --> 00:46.177
Just take a look at his swing
and tell me what you think.

00:47.546 --> 00:51.099
Wow.
Your mom must be some athlete.

00:51.166 --> 00:52.717
Just so you know,
I'm not a guy who's charmed

00:52.785 --> 00:54.902
when the help
gets familiar.

01:10.052 --> 01:12.270
How's everybody
this fine morning?

01:12.338 --> 01:14.355
Welp, I'm on my third day
of my New Year's Resolution

01:14.423 --> 01:16.274
to not say things
nobody cares about.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.392
Damn it.

01:17.459 --> 01:20.861
Oh, yay,
Homeowners Association.

01:20.929 --> 01:22.897
I need their approval to put
a She Shed in the backyard

01:22.964 --> 01:24.715
where the teeter-totter
used to be.

01:24.734 --> 01:25.816
I don't understand.

01:25.884 --> 01:28.069
She said,
"She Shed down by the seesaw."

01:28.137 --> 01:29.721
How are you not famous?

01:29.789 --> 01:31.756
Yes, bravo,
but what's a She Shed?

01:31.824 --> 01:33.240
Well, it's just
a simple little structure

01:33.308 --> 01:35.059
where I can go to be alone

01:35.127 --> 01:36.911
and do yoga or meditate

01:36.979 --> 01:38.946
and nobody can bother me.

01:39.014 --> 01:40.681
Oh, so a glass of wine
and a cigarette in the tub

01:40.749 --> 01:42.066
isn't cutting it anymore?

01:42.134 --> 01:44.268
I don't smoke, honey. I have
a tobacco-scented candle.

01:44.336 --> 01:45.970
They don't make
tobacco-scented...

01:46.038 --> 01:48.256
This is more of that stuff
no one cares about.

01:48.324 --> 01:49.940
Congratulations, honey.

01:50.008 --> 01:51.843
Don't pretend
you're happy for me.

01:51.910 --> 01:54.929
Luke and I wanted
to use that space
to put in a batting cage.

01:55.014 --> 01:56.414
Claire wanted her She Shed.

01:56.482 --> 02:00.252
We were in a stalemate,
so we settled
the dispute like adults.

02:05.991 --> 02:07.842
Come on, Dad.
Batting cage.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.410
I really need to blink,
buddy.

02:09.445 --> 02:11.079
You can blink
when you're dead.

02:12.931 --> 02:15.333
Ah, yes! Yes!

02:15.401 --> 02:18.904
All those Magic Eye posters
paid off. Ah!

02:18.971 --> 02:21.456
I'm gonna get myself one of
those fuzzy little rugs.

02:21.524 --> 02:23.958
They turned me down.
What?

02:24.026 --> 02:25.943
Why on Earth
would they do th...

02:26.011 --> 02:28.562
I-I'm gonna find out how
to get in touch with somebody

02:28.630 --> 02:30.097
from down at
that Homeowners Association

02:30.165 --> 02:31.666
and find out
what the hell is going on.

02:31.734 --> 02:32.917
Claire,
I know you're upset,

02:32.985 --> 02:34.552
but I don't think
you should do that.

02:34.604 --> 02:35.737
Well, look at that.

02:35.805 --> 02:37.355
They have a meeting
this afternoon.

02:37.422 --> 02:38.923
I'll just go down there
in person.

02:38.991 --> 02:42.744
Honey, I get a lot
of my referrals from the HOA.

02:42.811 --> 02:44.095
We can't afford
to alienate them.

02:44.162 --> 02:46.564
They are the ones
who are alienating people.

02:46.632 --> 02:48.650
They all live
on that stupid cul-de-sac.

02:48.717 --> 02:50.251
They only do things
for each other.

02:50.319 --> 02:53.504
Probably swing if they weren't
so aggressively unattractive.

02:53.572 --> 02:55.807
You know, I find the term
"She Shed" offensive.

02:55.858 --> 02:58.910
Shouldn't ours
just be called a shed
and <i> theirs</i> a "He Shed"?

02:58.977 --> 03:00.912
Why do you bother
making resolutions?

03:00.979 --> 03:02.413
This is so frustrating.

03:02.481 --> 03:03.781
If it's any comfort,

03:03.849 --> 03:06.217
you're not the only one
to be stung by these people.

03:06.285 --> 03:07.936
Their ridiculous
parking regulation

03:08.003 --> 03:09.154
made me give up my dream

03:09.221 --> 03:11.622
of owning
the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile.

03:11.690 --> 03:14.876
Dah! Fine.
I will move on.

03:14.878 --> 03:16.795
So does this mean
we can get our batting cage?

03:16.862 --> 03:19.297
Luke, too soon.

03:22.250 --> 03:24.619
I'm really proud of you, Mom.
Letting go shows real growth.

03:24.686 --> 03:26.521
I'm going to that Homeowners
Association meeting,

03:26.589 --> 03:27.939
and I'm getting
my She Shed.

03:28.007 --> 03:29.390
But you just told Dad...

03:29.458 --> 03:30.357
I let him do magic.

03:30.493 --> 03:31.826
He lets me break promises.

03:31.894 --> 03:34.295
We both know what we married.

03:34.313 --> 03:37.031
You were at the course
again?

03:37.099 --> 03:38.299
That's every morning
this week.

03:38.366 --> 03:39.984
That's how you make
a champion.

03:40.069 --> 03:41.036
You should see Joe play.

03:41.103 --> 03:43.354
It's like watching
Merv Griffin interview.

03:43.372 --> 03:45.089
There's a certain finesse
to it.

03:45.157 --> 03:46.991
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are <i> you</i> training for?

03:47.059 --> 03:48.059
Nothing.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.195
Yeah, then go have
a pudding cup.

03:50.262 --> 03:53.931
These high-performance protein
bars are for elite athletes.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.366
Go ahead, Joey.
Fuel up.

03:55.434 --> 03:57.419
You have a trophy
to bring back today.

03:57.486 --> 03:58.769
What are you
talking about?

03:58.837 --> 04:00.037
There's a kiddie tournament
up at the club,

04:00.105 --> 04:01.556
and I signed Joe up
for it.

04:01.623 --> 04:03.775
Jay, you're pushing him
too hard.

04:03.842 --> 04:05.709
What are you talking about?
Kid loves it.

04:05.777 --> 04:07.028
He'll tell you himself

04:07.313 --> 04:09.163
after he ices his shoulder.

04:09.231 --> 04:12.117
Ooh, that's the stuff.

04:12.184 --> 04:13.301
You know, Gloria,
with the right training,

04:13.369 --> 04:14.635
this kid could go
all the way.

04:14.703 --> 04:17.204
Me managing his golf career
can be my second act.

04:17.273 --> 04:18.305
You're 70.

04:18.373 --> 04:20.841
Your second act
was two acts ago.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.044
Stop living through him.
It's too much pressure.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.945
Why are you making
such a big deal about it?

04:25.013 --> 04:26.731
It's a--
It's a kiddie golf tournament.

04:26.798 --> 04:28.866
It's like a-a playdate
I don't hate being at.

04:28.934 --> 04:29.817
It's a bad idea.

04:29.952 --> 04:31.319
What if Joe
wants to do something

04:31.387 --> 04:32.820
that is less competitive,

04:32.888 --> 04:35.923
like reading or papier-mache?

04:35.975 --> 04:38.226
Let's not break out
the Manny playbook just yet.

04:38.293 --> 04:39.844
<i>Playbill</i> would've been
more cutting.

04:39.929 --> 04:41.111
Why am I helping you?

04:41.179 --> 04:42.429
I know you think
you have the monopoly

04:42.514 --> 04:43.814
on deciding
what's best for Joe,

04:43.882 --> 04:45.717
but I have
parenting instincts, too.

04:45.784 --> 04:48.619
I deferred to Dede
every single
time on Mitch and Claire,

04:48.687 --> 04:51.539
and this time
I'm going with my gut.

04:51.607 --> 04:54.141
Mitch and Claire turned out
to be wonderful people.

04:54.209 --> 04:55.126
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm not knocking them.

04:55.193 --> 04:56.494
I love all my children
equally.

04:56.562 --> 04:59.180
Bup, bup, bup, bup!
That's winner water.

05:03.853 --> 05:06.253
Whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Cam?

05:06.321 --> 05:07.171
I was gone
for 45 minutes,

05:07.239 --> 05:09.090
and now our living room's
a beauty salon?

05:09.158 --> 05:10.708
What, do you have a pit crew
or something?

05:10.776 --> 05:13.094
Ooh, look at you using
"pit crew" in
a sentence like a boy.

05:13.162 --> 05:14.962
Is this all for Lily's party?
You...

05:15.030 --> 05:16.964
I thought we were just gonna
do pizza and a movie.

05:17.032 --> 05:19.066
There are 12-year-old girls
coming over here.

05:19.134 --> 05:20.501
Do you remember
how mean and judgmental

05:20.569 --> 05:21.586
Haley was at that age?

05:21.654 --> 05:23.804
Yeah, I faked being sick
that Thanksgiving.

05:23.872 --> 05:26.290
I was too scared to eat corn
in front of her.

05:26.358 --> 05:27.525
Of course you were.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.477
The only word she said to me
that entire year was "ew."

05:29.545 --> 05:31.963
Anyway, Lily wants to impress
these older girls,

05:32.030 --> 05:35.667
so I set up a full-service
salon to do makeovers.

05:35.734 --> 05:38.302
And you're qualified
to do that because...?

05:38.370 --> 05:39.637
Okay, my uncle
was in the business

05:39.704 --> 05:41.272
of making mules appear younger
for sale,

05:41.340 --> 05:44.241
so I think I know a thing or
two about hair and make-up.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.493
Hi, hi. I brought y'all some
stuff

05:46.612 --> 05:47.946
for Lily's party.
Oh, my God.

05:48.013 --> 05:49.864
Thought you might not want
to get into your own stash.

05:49.931 --> 05:51.816
I know how pricy
your lady creams are.

05:51.867 --> 05:54.469
Okay, she's lashing out
because I inherited
Mama's skin.

05:54.787 --> 05:56.854
And I got Daddy's
strong flickin' finger.

05:56.922 --> 05:58.022
Don't do it! Don't!
Cam, you said

05:58.090 --> 05:59.474
that you were gonna keep
this small.

05:59.541 --> 06:01.393
See, now I feel like
you didn't tell me about this

06:01.460 --> 06:04.112
so that you could
set it all up
before I could say no.

06:04.180 --> 06:05.212
That is just not true.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.415
Not everyone is as calculating
as you think.

06:07.482 --> 06:09.600
But, hey, I know where
this is coming from,

06:09.668 --> 06:11.268
and it's not your fault.

06:11.336 --> 06:12.853
Seriously?
This again?

06:12.905 --> 06:14.272
This sounds private.

06:14.339 --> 06:16.207
If you want me to leave,
forget it.

06:16.275 --> 06:18.076
Okay, a-any time
we have an argument,

06:18.143 --> 06:20.361
Cam blames it on
how I was brought up.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.512
My therapist says

06:21.580 --> 06:23.982
that it's his way
of deflecting responsibility.

06:24.049 --> 06:26.033
You go to therapy?
Mm-hmm.

06:26.101 --> 06:28.185
You mean like one of those
Woody Allen movies?

06:28.253 --> 06:29.737
Plenty of people
go to therapy.

06:29.805 --> 06:30.988
Not farm folk.

06:30.990 --> 06:32.890
We solve our own problems,
not that we had many.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.393
That's right, because
you had a storybook childhood.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.178
I never said "storybook,"
although one time

06:37.245 --> 06:39.797
I did come home to a family
of bears eating our porridge.

06:39.865 --> 06:41.766
Don't make us
sound like hicks.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.417
It was Tuna Helper.

06:43.469 --> 06:44.969
But we did have our share
of problems.

06:45.036 --> 06:47.838
Ah!
Problems? What problems?

06:47.906 --> 06:49.641
Uh, Mama and Daddy?

06:49.708 --> 06:51.926
It's not like they had
the perfect marriage.

06:51.993 --> 06:53.160
Thank you. Thank you.

06:53.228 --> 06:54.912
I knew there was stuff.
Everybody has stuff.

06:54.980 --> 06:56.413
No, there is no stuff.

06:56.481 --> 06:58.816
She's just making this up
to get under my radiant skin.

06:58.884 --> 07:00.168
If you don't know
what I'm talking about,

07:00.235 --> 07:02.436
I'm not gonna tell you
right before you host
a big ol' party.

07:02.504 --> 07:05.573
Oh, no, no. We've got time.
Come on, come on.
Let's hear it.

07:06.942 --> 07:07.641
You don't remember
that time

07:07.709 --> 07:08.893
Daddy didn't live with us
for a year

07:08.961 --> 07:10.711
'cause he was shacked up
with that diner waitress

07:10.779 --> 07:12.564
Jannie Sue Butler?
Oh. Please.

07:12.631 --> 07:15.216
The only time Daddy ever left
was to go to war.

07:15.284 --> 07:18.569
It was 1977.
What war, Cam?

07:18.571 --> 07:20.304
The V...
Hmm?

07:20.372 --> 07:23.241
He left us 'cause
he turned 40,
he got his first liver spot,

07:23.292 --> 07:26.510
and that bimbo reminded him
of the Bionic Woman--

07:26.578 --> 07:29.647
mostly on account
of her fake arm.

07:30.532 --> 07:33.167
Oh, did you really
not know this?

07:33.235 --> 07:34.168
What?

07:34.236 --> 07:36.354
I did not realize how big
that was gonna be.

07:37.672 --> 07:39.673
Cam, hey.
Y-You're okay, right?

07:39.741 --> 07:43.661
Cam, I-I-I can't face
these 12-year-olds by myself.

07:43.729 --> 07:47.298
12-year-olds?
I got to change my shirt.

07:47.365 --> 07:50.417
They're already angry.

07:50.485 --> 07:53.721
Um, okay. Uh...

07:53.723 --> 07:55.072
What are you guys doing?

07:55.140 --> 07:57.275
Putting up our batting cage.
Oh, careful.

07:57.343 --> 07:58.809
It's really easy
to get caught in the net.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.110
Well,
you may want to take a beat.

08:00.178 --> 08:02.864
Mom went down
to the HOA meeting
to fight for her shed.

08:02.931 --> 08:03.881
Uh-oh.
I only hope

08:04.049 --> 08:05.616
she keeps her cool
and accepts their decision.

08:05.684 --> 08:09.304
Yeah, based on
her long history
of letting things go.

08:09.371 --> 08:10.722
Dad, we have a problem.

08:10.789 --> 08:12.873
Maybe not, buddy.
The HOA never reverses itself.

08:12.941 --> 08:14.892
If they did, we'd be
having this conversation

08:14.894 --> 08:16.644
in the front seat
of a giant hot dog.

08:16.711 --> 08:18.830
I <i> am</i> the HOA.
What?

08:18.931 --> 08:20.014
I intercepted
Mom's application

08:20.081 --> 08:22.149
and forged a rejection letter
from the board.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.118
Why?!
Because you told me to.

08:24.185 --> 08:26.404
When did I tell you
to do that?!

08:29.024 --> 08:30.891
Ah, yes! Yes!

08:30.959 --> 08:34.429
All those Magic Eye posters
paid off! Ah!

08:34.496 --> 08:36.130
This sucks.

08:36.198 --> 08:37.298
Who knows?

08:37.366 --> 08:39.332
Maybe the HOA board
will reject her application.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.635
Things have a way
of working themselves out.

08:41.669 --> 08:44.389
Are you saying
what I think you're saying?

08:44.456 --> 08:46.424
I think so.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.043
You gave me the signal.
What signal?!

08:49.110 --> 08:51.945
That wink when
you want me to secretly
take care of something.

08:52.013 --> 08:55.816
Of course I was winking.
I was just
in a staring contest.

08:55.884 --> 08:58.702
Wait. Did you say
you've done this before?

08:58.737 --> 09:01.388
Do you think Alex's cello
set itself on fire?

09:01.456 --> 09:02.740
Oh, my God.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.409
I got to get down to that
meeting before your mother...

09:06.628 --> 09:08.580
Untangle me quickly!

09:08.647 --> 09:09.864
Wait.
Was that a wink?

09:09.931 --> 09:11.499
Do you <i> not</i> want me
to untangle you?

09:11.566 --> 09:13.100
D-Do you want me
to untangle you slowly?

09:13.168 --> 09:14.835
There's no signal!

09:18.023 --> 09:19.173
Refreshing cucumber water?
No?

09:19.241 --> 09:21.592
Refreshing
cucumber water? No?

09:21.660 --> 09:24.762
Are you thirs...
Hey, you're doing great.

09:24.830 --> 09:26.847
Just don't get nervous
and turn all red.

09:26.915 --> 09:27.998
Do I do that?
Am I doing that right now?

09:28.166 --> 09:29.183
Do people notice?

09:30.235 --> 09:31.402
Okay, you're not 12.
It's okay.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.821
It got better.
It got better.

09:33.889 --> 09:35.506
Hey, Cam. H-How you feeling?
Hi.

09:35.573 --> 09:37.358
If you need
some time to process
that stuff about your dad,

09:37.425 --> 09:38.992
y-you sh...
Oh, no. I'm fine.

09:39.060 --> 09:41.079
Unlike the chlorine
in Melanie's hair

09:41.146 --> 09:43.030
that won't do
any permanent damage.

09:43.098 --> 09:44.782
Hey!
I'm working here, sweetie.

09:44.849 --> 09:48.535
Hi, girls.
I'm Lily's cool Aunt Pam.

09:48.603 --> 09:50.538
I brought lighters
for everyone.

09:50.605 --> 09:51.839
Please be nice.

09:51.907 --> 09:55.008
All right. We are done.
What do you think?

09:55.076 --> 09:56.894
I wanted to look
like Selena Gomez.

09:56.945 --> 09:59.380
Oh, well, I wanted a daddy
that would respect
his wedding vows,

09:59.448 --> 10:00.397
but we can't all get
what we want.

10:00.465 --> 10:02.149
Dream smaller.
There you go.

10:02.217 --> 10:05.169
Okay, okay.
See, it's stuff like that

10:05.237 --> 10:06.820
that makes me think
that you're not okay.

10:06.888 --> 10:08.822
Mitchell, it's just a joke.
It's barbershop sass.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.674
They love it
when I go there.

10:10.742 --> 10:13.678
All right, Violet,
get your fancy can
in the chair.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.162
You're up.

10:15.230 --> 10:18.632
Hi.
So, what are we doing today?

10:18.700 --> 10:20.334
I was thinking
of an updo.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.735
I like a high pony
for you.

10:21.803 --> 10:23.453
There we go.
Ow.

10:23.521 --> 10:28.159
Oh, so, Vi, I've seen your mom
at Parent Night.

10:28.227 --> 10:30.595
You know what?
I've never seen your dad.

10:30.645 --> 10:31.946
He works late a lot.

10:32.013 --> 10:33.831
Well, I hope that's true,
sweetie.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.048
Why wouldn't it be?

10:35.116 --> 10:37.001
I don't know.
Sometimes fathers lie.

10:37.069 --> 10:37.952
It's better for you
to find out now

10:38.020 --> 10:39.486
than when you're
a 40-year-old man.

10:39.554 --> 10:41.372
40? Okay,
speaking of fathers lying.

10:41.439 --> 10:42.640
Can I talk to you
for a second?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.458
Cam, move away, move away.
Hmm?

10:46.261 --> 10:49.146
Cam, Cam, clearly you're not
okay.
Okay, you know what?

10:49.214 --> 10:51.565
I thought-- I thought
I could tamp it down,
put it in a room,

10:51.633 --> 10:53.734
seal it shut just like we did
Grandpa when he got rabid.

10:53.802 --> 10:55.719
Okay, listen, I-I may have
checked with my therapist

10:55.787 --> 10:57.855
on the off chance
that you would
want to talk to someone.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.490
No, sir.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.525
If I open that door, there's
no telling what we'll find.

11:01.593 --> 11:04.028
You know what?
I-- You know
I cry inexplicably

11:04.030 --> 11:05.079
when I hear
"Smooth Operator."

11:05.147 --> 11:07.148
I don't want to know
what that's about.

11:07.150 --> 11:08.799
Hey, hey, just--
just give it a shot.

11:08.850 --> 11:10.601
Yeah, she's the best,
and if--

11:10.669 --> 11:12.653
if it makes you uncomfortable,
we can leave, all right?

11:12.721 --> 11:14.705
She-she has an opening
this afternoon.

11:14.772 --> 11:16.274
What if the party's
still going on?

11:16.341 --> 11:18.259
Your sister's here.
They'll be fine.

11:18.276 --> 11:19.326
Okay, truth.

11:19.394 --> 11:21.295
How old were you
when you first kissed a boy?

11:21.363 --> 11:23.464
Hmm... a boy <i> person?</i>

11:24.750 --> 11:25.866
I love that you're here,

11:25.933 --> 11:28.953
but don't you guys have
a laundry room at the school?

11:29.004 --> 11:29.904
It's really humid
down there,

11:30.038 --> 11:31.639
and my hair is
challenging enough as it is.

11:31.706 --> 11:33.908
I thought you'd be going
to Joe's tournament.

11:33.975 --> 11:35.293
No, he doesn't need me
over there.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.678
I would be adding
more pressure.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.830
Well, you always kept
a low profile

11:38.897 --> 11:40.063
at my ribbon-dancing
competitions.

11:40.131 --> 11:41.465
I couldn't even find you
in the stands.

11:41.533 --> 11:46.437
Ah, yeah, with the ribbon
and the swooshing.

11:46.505 --> 11:50.024
But Joe worries me because
stress can destroy a child.

11:50.091 --> 11:54.027
Take it from
Cartagena's junior
regional backstroke champion.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.446
You used to swim?

11:55.514 --> 11:58.899
Like a cigarette boat
fleeing to
international waters.

11:58.967 --> 12:02.352
But all that stress
brought the darkness in me.

12:02.420 --> 12:06.791
I started pulling out my hair,
and... there was an incident.

12:06.858 --> 12:08.075
What kind of incident?

12:08.143 --> 12:09.110
I'm ashamed to admit it,

12:09.177 --> 12:11.229
but when I lost
one of the big races,

12:11.296 --> 12:13.847
I might have hit
one of the other swimmers

12:13.915 --> 12:15.800
in the leg
with a skimmer pole.

12:15.867 --> 12:17.534
You Tonya Harding-ed
another girl?

12:17.602 --> 12:20.221
No, in Colombia, they call it
the Gloria Ramirez-ing.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.242
Mom, just because you freaked
out doesn't mean Joe will.

12:25.310 --> 12:26.494
At the end of the day,

12:26.562 --> 12:28.645
he's only going to remember
that you weren't there.

12:28.697 --> 12:29.497
I don't know.

12:29.564 --> 12:30.998
I think it would mean
a lot to him.

12:31.066 --> 12:32.400
I know it meant
a lot to me

12:32.467 --> 12:34.735
when you cheered
on me and my ribbon-dancing
partner, Josh.

12:34.802 --> 12:37.037
Uh, yeah,
'cause you guys were so great.

12:37.105 --> 12:38.589
I danced alone.

12:41.894 --> 12:43.344
Next order of business,

12:43.412 --> 12:46.997
uh, Lisa would like to put in
a little moat in her yard.

12:47.132 --> 12:48.415
Aw,
and with a drawbridge

12:48.483 --> 12:50.284
from the sidewalk
to the front door.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.402
I've always dreamed
of being a princess.

12:52.470 --> 12:53.287
All in favor?

12:53.472 --> 12:55.656
Aye!
Eyesore.

12:55.724 --> 12:57.341
Claire,
did you say something?

12:57.408 --> 12:58.442
I'm sorry.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.310
You're just gonna
rubber-stamp
Princess Lisa here,

13:00.378 --> 13:03.363
and I can't have a She Shed
in my backyard?

13:03.465 --> 13:04.565
Could you please
wait your turn?

13:04.633 --> 13:06.500
W-We haven't moved on
to new business yet.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.003
Fine. Motion to discuss
new business?

13:09.071 --> 13:11.972
Seconded. Recognizing
Claire Dunphy. Thank you.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.058
I'm not leaving here
until I have my permit.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.376
What are you
talking about?

13:15.443 --> 13:17.428
I submitted a request
to build a simple structure

13:17.496 --> 13:19.696
you can't even see
from the street.

13:19.764 --> 13:22.649
Speaking of which,
why is nobody
sounding the alarm

13:22.717 --> 13:25.602
over Gary's
avant-garde mailbox?

13:25.670 --> 13:27.938
It's a penis, Gary.
Honey.

13:28.006 --> 13:29.439
What? What? Oh!
What are you doing here?

13:29.507 --> 13:30.691
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

13:30.758 --> 13:32.426
I'm so sorry to interrupt.
Keep up the great work.

13:32.493 --> 13:33.510
It couldn't have been easy

13:33.578 --> 13:35.095
keeping that sewer gator
under wraps.

13:35.163 --> 13:37.031
What alligator?

13:37.132 --> 13:38.733
No, that.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.267
See that?
That's not fair.

13:40.334 --> 13:43.020
Just because I'm not part of
your little cul-de-sac cult--

13:43.088 --> 13:44.972
your little cult-de-sac...
Oh, that was a good one.

13:45.040 --> 13:47.024
I think you made your point.
Why don't we get going?

13:47.092 --> 13:49.226
Claire, this is the first
we're hearing
about your She Shed.

13:49.294 --> 13:53.297
Oh. Then I've got something
for you right here.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.565
She's got a gun!

13:54.632 --> 13:56.099
It's a letter, Lisa--

13:56.151 --> 14:00.504
a rejection letter
on HOA stationery.

14:00.572 --> 14:01.522
Stationery?
Mm-hmm!

14:01.589 --> 14:02.423
In the interest
of saving trees,

14:02.490 --> 14:04.875
we do all our correspondence
via e-mail.

14:04.910 --> 14:06.510
Come on, Claire,
we don't need to sit here

14:06.578 --> 14:08.361
and listen to these pillars
of the community.

14:08.446 --> 14:09.880
Then who sent me
this letter?

14:09.948 --> 14:12.399
Who knew
I even wanted a She Shed?

14:12.467 --> 14:15.119
Who even... cared?

14:20.175 --> 14:21.842
Okay.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.810
It's a straight shot, pal.

14:23.878 --> 14:26.563
You got this.
How are you feeling?

14:26.631 --> 14:27.881
I'm nervous.

14:27.949 --> 14:29.717
My son was being tested
as an athlete,

14:29.784 --> 14:31.669
but I was being tested
as a father.

14:31.720 --> 14:36.240
What I said then would help
shape the man Joe
would become.

14:36.308 --> 14:37.691
Nerves are for losers.

14:37.776 --> 14:39.777
What you're feeling
is excitement,

14:39.844 --> 14:41.211
because for the first time
in your life,

14:41.363 --> 14:43.230
you're doing something
that actually matters.

14:43.298 --> 14:45.182
These other kids--
they want you to choke

14:45.250 --> 14:46.900
because you're king
of the mountain,

14:46.968 --> 14:48.652
and they're climbing
to reach you.

14:48.670 --> 14:51.154
You've got to be ready
to step on their fingers.

14:51.222 --> 14:52.589
That sounds mean.

14:52.591 --> 14:53.773
They would do
the same thing to you.

14:53.841 --> 14:56.276
Now, get out there
and take what is ours.

14:56.344 --> 14:57.744
And have fun.

15:08.372 --> 15:10.740
Huh.
That's new.

15:13.027 --> 15:15.279
She's right behind me.
She knows about the letter.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.114
What are we gonna do?
We have to think of an excuse.

15:17.182 --> 15:18.198
We don't have time!

15:20.569 --> 15:23.053
Huh.
Guess she hit a light.

15:23.121 --> 15:24.838
All right. Well,
let's think this through.

15:24.906 --> 15:25.706
Oh.

15:25.774 --> 15:28.726
Really, Phil?!
You just turned and ran?

15:28.794 --> 15:29.976
Sweetheart, I...

15:30.712 --> 15:31.645
I...

15:31.713 --> 15:32.680
Don't you run again.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.180
Okay.

15:34.248 --> 15:36.416
I have one question.
Why?

15:36.418 --> 15:37.784
It's complicated.

15:37.852 --> 15:39.136
How is it complicated?

15:39.204 --> 15:41.171
You printed fake stationery
and forged a letter

15:41.239 --> 15:43.290
so you could have
a stupid batting cage.

15:43.357 --> 15:44.975
It's not his fault.
Luke...

15:45.043 --> 15:47.278
I'm gonna tell her.

15:47.346 --> 15:48.946
He got scared.
What?

15:49.013 --> 15:50.431
He thought you would
like being out there alone
in your shed

15:50.498 --> 15:52.767
so much you'd stop wanting
to spend time with him.

15:52.834 --> 15:54.184
Come on.

15:54.252 --> 15:56.370
He was worried
maybe you'd start
sleeping out there.

15:56.438 --> 15:59.055
Pretty soon it's where you
and your friends go to drink

15:59.190 --> 16:01.024
and complain
about your husbands.

16:01.092 --> 16:02.275
Oh, I don't need a shed
for that.

16:02.343 --> 16:03.927
We-we do it on group text.
Huh?

16:03.995 --> 16:05.746
Honey, I didn't know
that's how you felt.

16:05.814 --> 16:07.631
Why didn't you
say something?

16:07.699 --> 16:10.167
I guess I'm not comfortable
being vulnerable

16:10.234 --> 16:13.037
Oh.
except-except with Luke.

16:13.104 --> 16:15.072
The whole reason
I wanted to get that shed

16:15.140 --> 16:17.508
was to give myself
a place to calm down

16:17.576 --> 16:20.460
and spare you
some of my insanity.

16:20.528 --> 16:23.313
If anything, I-I thought
it would help
our relationship.

16:23.432 --> 16:24.982
Sweetheart.

16:25.049 --> 16:26.016
He accepts your apology.

16:26.083 --> 16:29.269
I got it from here, buddy.
Mm.

16:29.354 --> 16:33.207
We got our batting cage...
sort of.

16:33.274 --> 16:34.324
Ugh!

16:34.392 --> 16:36.894
Hey, Mom, think we can get
in there any time soon?

16:36.962 --> 16:39.613
Not after
the day I've had!

16:39.681 --> 16:42.382
Come on, buddy.
Let's try again tomorrow.

16:43.384 --> 16:44.818
Come on.

16:45.403 --> 16:46.704
Yeah!

16:46.771 --> 16:48.955
Here you go.

16:49.974 --> 16:52.392
What is this?!
I need a putter!

16:52.460 --> 16:54.545
Take it easy.
You're only down
by one stroke.

16:54.613 --> 16:56.263
Don't remind me!

16:56.330 --> 16:59.600
He's fine, everybody.
He's fine.

16:59.617 --> 17:00.951
Good luck, Joe.

17:01.019 --> 17:02.870
Gloria? I-I guess
you're here to pull Joey
out of the tournament.

17:02.937 --> 17:04.137
No, no.
I came to cheer him on.

17:04.204 --> 17:05.521
No, but I thought about
what you were saying,

17:05.589 --> 17:06.790
and even though
you weren't right,

17:06.858 --> 17:08.175
I'm gonna let you
have this one.

17:08.242 --> 17:10.176
You can do this, baby.

17:10.243 --> 17:12.128
I'm trying
to concentrate!

17:12.196 --> 17:13.263
What is that all about?

17:13.330 --> 17:16.049
I don't know, Gloria.
You seem to make him tense.

17:19.487 --> 17:22.189
Uh, so there's
this other thing.
I knew it!

17:22.257 --> 17:23.641
You were in my eyeline!

17:23.742 --> 17:25.791
No. Wait. Joe, come here!

17:25.827 --> 17:28.328
I'm going to step on your
fingers!
Joe, come back here!

17:28.396 --> 17:30.214
I'm the king of the mountain!
Give me the club!

17:30.282 --> 17:31.515
Give me the club.

17:31.582 --> 17:33.316
Give me the club!

17:33.384 --> 17:35.101
Why?!

17:35.169 --> 17:36.871
Not again.

17:36.938 --> 17:39.673
You're gonna love hockey.

17:39.741 --> 17:41.141
Okay.
You know what?

17:41.209 --> 17:43.510
If people back home knew
I was in a therapist's office,

17:43.578 --> 17:46.663
it would be all over the
"Rumors and Ramblins" section

17:46.731 --> 17:48.231
of the <i> Grasshopper Gazette.</i>

17:48.299 --> 17:50.601
"Liberal Left Coast
Breaks Local Hero."

17:50.668 --> 17:52.018
What are you typing?

17:52.086 --> 17:53.020
Exactly what
you just said,

17:53.088 --> 17:54.588
but don't worry, it's for
my therapy, not yours.

17:54.656 --> 17:56.390
You know what?
This <i> is</i> your therapy,

17:56.457 --> 17:58.025
and I don't want
to be here.

17:58.092 --> 17:59.576
Cam, come on.
You need this.

17:59.644 --> 18:01.461
Just give it a shot.
Come on!

18:01.563 --> 18:03.664
Hello, Mitchell.

18:03.848 --> 18:04.915
Hi, Dr. Green.

18:04.983 --> 18:07.601
Thank you so much
for making the time to see us.

18:07.603 --> 18:08.969
Okay, what's that voice?
Hmm?

18:09.037 --> 18:10.454
Are you tamping
down your crazy

18:10.522 --> 18:12.822
to impress your therapist like
you do
No. No.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.291
when you clean up
before the housekeeper comes?

18:14.358 --> 18:16.743
I appreciate
what you're saying,

18:16.811 --> 18:20.347
I hear you, and I'm gonna
give it some thought.

18:20.414 --> 18:22.883
The hell?
Can we move into this place?

18:22.951 --> 18:24.168
You must be Cameron.
Yes.

18:24.235 --> 18:26.136
So nice to meet you.
I've heard
so much about you...

18:26.204 --> 18:27.904
Da-ba-mnh-mnh.
Unh-unh.

18:27.972 --> 18:29.540
Mitchell, how do you feel

18:29.607 --> 18:31.108
about how you're behaving
right now?

18:31.176 --> 18:33.060
I don't love it.
Can I-- Can I restart?

18:33.128 --> 18:34.778
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

18:34.846 --> 18:36.179
A-All right.
Um, you know what?

18:36.247 --> 18:37.831
This-this--
I don't want to be here.

18:37.899 --> 18:39.550
This just isn't me.

18:39.617 --> 18:41.084
The art on the wall
is weird.

18:41.152 --> 18:43.970
The candy bowl
feels like a test, uh...

18:44.055 --> 18:46.656
You know what?
I'm gonna have, uh, just one.

18:46.724 --> 18:49.776
Nope.
I'm gonna have all of them.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.629
Nope. I'm just gonna leave.

18:51.696 --> 18:54.764
Cam, the first step is the
hardest, but it's worth it.

18:54.832 --> 18:57.167
It takes time to work through
family issues.

18:57.235 --> 18:59.336
Yeah, she's right. Some people
spend their whole lives

18:59.403 --> 19:01.472
trying to resolve
these things.

19:01.540 --> 19:04.174
What would I--
What would I even say to her?

19:04.242 --> 19:07.845
That my dad left for a year
with the town floozy

19:07.912 --> 19:09.596
and I thought he was off
being a war hero

19:09.663 --> 19:10.797
and that I'm an idiot

19:10.849 --> 19:12.800
and-and that I'm never
gonna forgive him?

19:12.867 --> 19:15.436
I don't care that he came--
came back to us.

19:15.503 --> 19:18.171
He lied to me, and he let me
grow up thinking my mama

19:18.173 --> 19:20.958
was the most important thing
to him in the world.

19:21.025 --> 19:23.293
He's a phony.

19:23.361 --> 19:25.763
You know, maybe,
you know, he did do the best

19:25.830 --> 19:28.131
he-he knew how,
you know?

19:28.199 --> 19:32.703
He always did
make me feel safe
and-and happy.

19:34.321 --> 19:36.206
Maybe he was
just trying to protect me,

19:36.241 --> 19:38.776
because he did love me
with all of his heart,

19:38.843 --> 19:41.828
and, actually,
I feel like I know him,

19:41.896 --> 19:46.166
like, even better now
and love him even more.

19:46.233 --> 19:48.151
I am the person I am

19:48.219 --> 19:51.255
because of
all my experiences.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.157
And I like me.

19:54.225 --> 19:58.312
And I have a daddy
to thank for that.

19:58.379 --> 20:00.180
Whew. Ooh!

20:00.247 --> 20:02.516
Hey! That felt great.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.568
Oh, my gosh.
I feel healed.

20:04.636 --> 20:06.370
Yeah, well, it's a good start,
but therapy really is a...

20:06.438 --> 20:09.256
No, no, no, no, no, no.
That was extraordinary.

20:09.323 --> 20:12.209
I have never seen
anything like that.

20:12.277 --> 20:14.027
He doesn't need me.

20:14.094 --> 20:15.211
Here.

20:15.279 --> 20:17.981
Have a hard candy
and a good life.

20:18.049 --> 20:21.485
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
He's done? No, no.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.921
Okay, I have-- I have been
coming here for ten years,

20:23.989 --> 20:26.189
and I am just barely
scratching the surface.

20:26.257 --> 20:27.741
You call him extraordinary.

20:27.809 --> 20:30.694
Meanwhile,
I've been pouring out
my soul to you every week,

20:30.762 --> 20:33.914
and I get-- boop-- nothing.

20:33.981 --> 20:36.750
Mitchell, I did clear out
the full hour.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.752
If you'd like to...

20:38.820 --> 20:40.186
That would be great,
Doctor. Thank you so much.

20:40.254 --> 20:41.388
I would love that.
Mm-hmm.

20:41.455 --> 20:43.106
Cam, I will see you at home.
Okay, okay.

20:45.243 --> 20:46.793
You chose the right one.
I'm waiting!

20:50.015 --> 20:51.865
You sure do know
how to hide, buddy.

20:51.933 --> 20:54.368
I'm looking everywhere.

20:56.471 --> 20:59.556
Nope.
Not under the pool table.

20:59.624 --> 21:02.258
Where, oh where, could you be?

21:02.326 --> 21:04.110
Manny,
I am very busy.

21:04.195 --> 21:05.979
Can't this wait?
I've waited ten years.

21:06.046 --> 21:08.949
This is happening. Sit.
Hey, I'm watching something.

21:09.016 --> 21:10.149
Yes, you are!

21:10.217 --> 21:13.203
Presenting
"Rhapsody in Ribbon."

21:15.723 --> 21:17.374
You're it. I'm hiding.

21:18.309 --> 21:22.613
One, two, three,

21:22.681 --> 21:26.867
four, five, six...
