Johnny-Ray is due here
any minute.

just the other day.

I wonder why he's coming back
so soon.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.764

I'm here to get the sweetest

I hope all of you

can join us at Suzette's
birthday pancake party.

- Good idea, Violet.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.987

ponytail bow.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.945
- [whinnies]

02:00.032 --> 02:03.123
- And it's the same shade as
Suzette's favorite apples.

02:03.210 --> 02:06.517
- And to finish the look...
- [barks]

02:08.650 --> 02:11.131
- What about some apple green
glitter polish?

02:11.218 --> 02:13.916

birthday girl?

02:14.003 --> 02:15.961

02:33.544 --> 02:36.547
- [whinnies]
[laughter]

02:36.634 --> 02:38.375

[barks]

02:39.811 --> 02:43.337
- Thanks, Rosie.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.774
- Almost done brushing
your tail, Suzette.

02:45.861 --> 02:48.777
Just a few more strokes.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.996
Ready with the ribbon, Rox?

02:51.083 --> 02:52.433

let's talk pancakes.

03:23.159 --> 03:25.727
Where? When?
What kind?

03:25.814 --> 03:28.947
- I'm making Suzette's
favorite, apple pancakes,

03:29.034 --> 03:32.342
topped with fresh syrup
from Timmy's maple grove.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.518
- Timmy has a maple grove?

03:34.605 --> 03:37.652
- Yep.
But it's deep in the woods.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.871
It's pretty tricky to find.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.134
- We can follow you
in the Glam Van.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.920
Come on!
Let's go.

03:45.007 --> 03:46.182
- Such great service.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.662
They even open the door
for you.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.794
- Actually, Lacey,
we were just--

03:49.881 --> 03:52.710
- Hi, Sunny.
Lacey wants the works:

03:52.797 --> 03:56.845
shampoo, blow-dry,
a fantastic new hairstyle.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.108
- I'm not sure exactly
what I want yet,

03:59.195 --> 04:01.241
but we'll figure that out
once we get started.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.113
Really take our time.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.290
- Uh, sorry, Johnny-Ray.

04:07.377 --> 04:10.162
Looks like we won't be
heading out anytime soon.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.600
[all groan,
Violet chatters indistinctly]

04:12.687 --> 04:14.384
- Tell you what.
How about I take Doodle

04:14.471 --> 04:16.081
and the little
critters with me?

04:16.168 --> 04:18.649
That way, Suzette has
some friends to play with.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.695
- I like it!

04:24.046 --> 04:27.484

- You all can join us
when you finish up.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.233
- But wait.
Didn't you say

04:37.320 --> 04:39.322
the maple grove
was tricky to find?

04:39.409 --> 04:41.411
- Uh-huh.
But no problem.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.326
Timmy gave me a map.

04:43.413 --> 04:45.720
Suzette and I know the way now,
so you can have it.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.331
- Thanks, Johnny-Ray.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.072
- See you girls at the party.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.904

- Yep.

04:55.991 --> 04:57.645
It's Suzette's birthday today.

04:57.732 --> 04:59.777
- Suzette?

04:59.864 --> 05:02.302
Oh!
Pony Suzette.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.695
She and I
are basically besties.

05:04.782 --> 05:06.393
We're invited too.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.917
To her, uh, pizza party
at the...

05:09.004 --> 05:10.135

05:10.222 --> 05:11.659
Aren't we, KC?

05:11.746 --> 05:12.660

Oh, yeah.

05:14.531 --> 05:17.273

at the maple grove?

05:20.885 --> 05:22.191
- Uh, yeah, right.
That one.

05:22.278 --> 05:25.150
So better get to work
on my styling.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.425
- You seem like a natural
in the saddle, Doodle.

05:38.512 --> 05:41.297
- I was practically born on
horseback, you know.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.472
- You were?

05:42.559 --> 05:43.778
Great!

05:43.865 --> 05:46.563
Then what are we waiting for?

me pancake party ready?

05:55.224 --> 05:57.792
- Well, ponytail was our style
of the day.

05:57.879 --> 06:00.795
And when I say "pony,"
I do mean pony.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.449

- Hmm.

06:02.536 --> 06:03.711
I'm not sure.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.800
What do you think, KC?

06:05.887 --> 06:09.238
- I think they may run out of
pancakes before we get there.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.501
- Ponytail it is.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.635
- Ooh, this looks great.

06:14.722 --> 06:17.812
- I'll just braid in
this ribbon.

06:17.899 --> 06:18.900
There.

06:18.987 --> 06:20.336
And to finish the look,

06:20.423 --> 06:23.165
an apple green bow
just like Suzette.

06:24.688 --> 06:27.125
- Is my bow bigger than hers?

06:27.212 --> 06:29.301
- Uh, yes?

- Perfect!

the ground wasn't where it
should have been.

down here.

to keep one end up there?

10:47.081 --> 10:50.127
This dot on the map,
the maple grove.

10:50.214 --> 10:51.955
I told you I'd get us here,
didn't I?

10:52.042 --> 10:55.176
- These don't look like
maple trees.

10:55.263 --> 10:57.395
- Details.
Let's find Suzette.

10:59.006 --> 11:00.572
- Um, Sunny?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.836
Lacey did get us to the spot
on the map,

11:02.923 --> 11:04.838
but it's not the maple grove.

11:04.925 --> 11:08.972
It's just a big blob
of glitter polish.

11:09.059 --> 11:10.147
- What?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.628
Glitter polish?
No way.

11:15.239 --> 11:17.024
Yep, that's glitter polish
all right.

11:17.111 --> 11:18.286
- [groans]

11:18.373 --> 11:20.505
- The map can still help us.

11:20.592 --> 11:24.161
We just need to take the path
through these trees.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.163
- It's too narrow to drive,
though.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.688
- Let's leave the Glam Van here
and walk.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.342
- Walk?
Through the woods?

11:31.429 --> 11:33.257
- No, thank you.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.172
KC and I will wait here.

11:35.259 --> 11:36.913
Come get us
when you find the party.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.178
- Okay.
We'll be back soon.

11:43.485 --> 11:46.227
Walk?
- I know, right?

And I mean, it's not like
we'll be scared

11:48.229 --> 11:51.058

with all these spooky trees

11:51.145 --> 11:52.581

12:01.546 --> 12:04.027
Did you know...[gulps]

12:04.114 --> 12:08.205
There are over 7,500 varieties
of apples in the world?

12:08.292 --> 12:11.034
[laughs]
I don't grow nearly that many.

12:11.121 --> 12:14.646
But I do have Jonathan
and Pink Lady,

12:14.734 --> 12:18.563
Golden Delicious,
Red Delicious.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.827
Ooh, Granny Smith?

12:20.914 --> 12:22.219
It's nice and juicy.

12:22.306 --> 12:24.004
- No, thanks.

12:25.745 --> 12:28.008
- Wait.
Do you hear that?

12:28.095 --> 12:30.575
- Sorry.
It's my tummy rumbling.

12:30.662 --> 12:33.361
I am really excited
about pancakes.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.450
- [laughs]
No, not that.

12:35.537 --> 12:37.191
I hear rushing water.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.497
- There's a stream here
on the map.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.762
That means the maple grove
is just on the other side.

12:44.894 --> 12:45.808
- Stream?

12:45.895 --> 12:49.029
More like a small ocean.

12:49.116 --> 12:50.682
- How do we get across?

12:50.770 --> 12:52.946
Without my floaties,
I'm not much of a swimmer.

12:53.033 --> 12:56.950
- Hmm.

12:57.037 --> 13:00.040
Why swim when we can fly?

13:00.127 --> 13:01.606
- Can I help you, Sunny?

13:01.693 --> 13:03.086
- Sure thing.
Here.

13:03.173 --> 13:06.437

13:20.016 --> 13:23.367

13:23.454 --> 13:24.804
- Think of the pancakes.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.457
Think of the pancakes.

13:26.544 --> 13:27.545
Ooh.

13:27.632 --> 13:30.157
- Come on, KC.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.117
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right!

13:37.904 --> 13:39.906
Oh, the piñata!
The, uh--

13:39.993 --> 13:41.646

13:41.733 --> 13:43.344
See that rock?

13:43.431 --> 13:44.911
- Mm-hmm.

13:44.998 --> 13:48.131
- If I can lasso it,
we can climb up to it

13:48.218 --> 13:50.264
and then shimmy our way
out of this hole!

13:50.351 --> 13:52.919
- They don't call me Timmy
the Shimmy for nothing!

13:53.006 --> 13:54.703
Let's give it a try.

No way.

We'll find Sunny soon,

out of that hole,

Don't worry.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.059

Well, that's not good.

17:40.146 --> 17:44.585

We'll never find them.

Can you take us to them?

17:47.936 --> 17:50.678

If I only knew how.

Wait, I do know

I know.

Okay, Suzette.

You can do it.

You got any more?

- I got it!
Timmy!

19:26.513 --> 19:28.297
Can you throw one
of those apples up here?

19:29.994 --> 19:32.693
- Yes?
Oh.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.611
- Got it!
- Uh...

Anywhere we can get
a long twig?

- And we'll need more ribbon.
- Let's see.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.059
Sorry, Doodle, I'm all out.

19:51.146 --> 19:53.888

we can get more ribbon.
