[room goes silent]

00:28.528 --> 00:31.865
[prosecutor] The defendant
committed his murders consciously,

00:31.948 --> 00:34.409
showing no sign of remorse.

00:34.492 --> 00:37.954
He didn't even show remorse
when he confessed to it.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.749
Is this so, Ms. Murillo?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.043
Yes or no?

00:45.754 --> 00:47.547
For him it wasn't about guilt.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.716
It was about...

00:49.799 --> 00:51.885
He thought
it was the right thing to do.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.971
He believed that his victims
deserved to die?

00:55.054 --> 00:58.725
People who hadn't been
convicted of any crime.

00:58.808 --> 01:00.727
That doesn't mean
they were innocent.

01:03.188 --> 01:06.357
[prosecutor] Do you believe
that Mr. Petersen's victims

01:06.441 --> 01:07.859
deserved to die?

01:07.942 --> 01:10.111
No, I don't think so.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.198
He believed it, he told me.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.075
He thought he was doing good,

01:16.159 --> 01:18.745
that he was helping
to clean this world a little.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.748
[prosecutor] Did he ever show
regret for his crimes?

01:21.831 --> 01:23.082
[Elisa] No.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.543
He told me he was proud.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.758
Thank you very much
for your testimony, Ms. Murillo.

[Celeste]
I'm looking for my sister, Blanca.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.379
[girl] I know your story.

02:51.462 --> 02:52.714
[Celeste] Who are you?

02:52.797 --> 02:55.091
[girl] You come here not knowing
who's waiting for you?

02:56.050 --> 02:57.468
[Celeste] Z?

02:57.552 --> 02:59.304
How did you know
I was looking for you?

02:59.387 --> 03:02.223
-You messaged me!
-The message was rejected.

03:02.307 --> 03:04.142
That doesn't mean
I didn't get it, does it?

03:04.225 --> 03:06.269
Now, who gave you my address?

03:07.270 --> 03:09.898
If I told you who, you wouldn't
trust me, would you?

03:12.108 --> 03:14.152
It's obvious that it was Tanaka.

03:14.235 --> 03:15.904
That guy's obsessed with me.

03:15.987 --> 03:17.906
OK, kid. Hand over the computer.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.536
-[baby coos]
-Yeah.

03:23.620 --> 03:24.954
-[Carla] Who did that to you?
-[Dani] I don't know!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.540
-[Carla] You must. Who did it?
-What is it?

03:27.624 --> 03:29.000
-[Dani] I don't know, Mom.
-[Carla] You can't not know!

03:29.083 --> 03:30.501
-[Carla] Who did this?
-[Dani] Don't be mad at me!

03:30.585 --> 03:33.171
-Dani, I'm not angry!
-Carla, what is it?

03:33.254 --> 03:35.256
Look at her neck,
how doesn't she know?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.467
Anyone can touch you
without you noticing?

03:37.550 --> 03:39.719
[Marcos] It's one of those
temporary tattoos.

03:39.802 --> 03:41.054
No! It's not that!

03:41.137 --> 03:43.264
Who did this to you?
Focus and tell me!

03:43.348 --> 03:45.391
-This is not a game!

[cocks gun]

04:22.262 --> 04:24.305
Do you know what my mask means?

04:25.598 --> 04:29.602
A plaster fox only protects you
if someone's afraid of it.

04:29.686 --> 04:30.895
To ensure fear,

04:30.979 --> 04:33.481
every so often
you have to beat someone up.

04:33.564 --> 04:34.774
Fuck them up.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.025
And that's what I do.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.610
I fuck these pigs up.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.447
Now, these motherfuckers
aren't just anyone.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.617
These bastards are professional
hackers. Neo-Nazi types.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.202
I don't care.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.787
I have to save my sister.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.164
-Did you hear me?
-Give me the address!

04:50.248 --> 04:53.376
You think you're so tough?
That you can just show up?

04:55.211 --> 04:56.421
Give me the address.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.467
You've got ovaries, kid.
I like you.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.635
Take notes.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.471
Because if the Pack think
they're the fierce ones

05:05.555 --> 05:06.848
and we're the victims...

05:06.931 --> 05:09.183
This isn't a game
of wolves versus sheep.

05:09.267 --> 05:10.601
It's wolves versus lionesses.

05:10.685 --> 05:13.938
So if you see one,
on behalf of all women,

05:14.022 --> 05:16.482
shoot him in the balls.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.942
Did you hear me?

05:20.069 --> 05:21.362
Thank you.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.750
Do you know how many years
I've been teaching?

05:36.919 --> 05:40.548
Do you know how many students
I've seen pregnant?

05:40.631 --> 05:43.926
How many 13 and 14-year-olds

05:45.219 --> 05:48.598
have cried in my office,
asking for my help?

05:48.681 --> 05:50.099
And that's how you help them?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.519
Drugging them so they don't
remember the birth?

05:54.771 --> 05:56.397
Telling them their children
were stillborn

05:56.481 --> 05:58.066
and burying empty coffins?

05:58.149 --> 06:00.777
-Father, you don't have to answer.
-I want to answer.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.031
Everything that happened...

06:07.033 --> 06:08.785
was authorized by the families.

06:08.868 --> 06:10.828
But not the mothers, Mr. Belmar.

06:11.496 --> 06:15.958
A 15, 16-year-old girl
can't make that kind of decision.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.794
You yourself said
that little girls,

06:17.877 --> 06:20.046
aged 15 and 16,
were capable of deciding

06:20.129 --> 06:23.132
to have group sex
with your top students.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.675
That they were adults.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.470
That they had the maturity
to consent to what happened,

06:27.553 --> 06:30.515
but they're not to decide
whether they want to be mothers?

06:30.598 --> 06:33.559
Your concept of women
is very strange, Father.

06:33.643 --> 06:36.104
Have you ever stopped to think...

06:36.187 --> 06:38.189
what would have happened
to those children?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.277
They would have ended up
abandoned in a landfill.

06:45.321 --> 06:47.198
Murdered with knitting needles

06:47.907 --> 06:50.284
or in the hands
of illegal abortionists.

06:50.368 --> 06:53.454
I've never seen you campaigning
for safe, legal abortions.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.289
If that's what we're
talking about.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.708
No, and I wouldn't.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.463
I...didn't steal those children.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.926
I saved their lives.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.224
I have no regrets about
what I did with those children

07:13.307 --> 07:14.600
and those mothers.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.732
I held Blanca in my arms,
the moment she was born.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.988
And I took her
to the best family I could find.

07:27.071 --> 07:29.615
Time proved me right.

07:29.699 --> 07:33.411
What you did, Mr. Belmar...
is a felony,

07:33.494 --> 07:35.746
to which you just confessed.

07:35.830 --> 07:39.458
Do you think that I,
now after almost 20 years,

07:39.542 --> 07:42.211
would do something
like that to Blanca?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.839
Who do you think
you're talking to?

07:44.922 --> 07:46.424
I'm a priest.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.344
I've dedicated my whole life
to my fellow man.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.309
Commissioner, can I ask you
to finish this now?

07:56.392 --> 07:57.935
No further questions.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.003
-Should we paint?
-[baby babbles]

08:25.379 --> 08:27.506
What do they have
to protect us from?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.427
Just stuff, my little mouse.

08:31.510 --> 08:32.845
They have to take care of us.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.431
I already told you, right?

08:35.514 --> 08:37.433
You can't talk to strangers.

08:37.516 --> 08:39.018
We have to be careful

08:39.101 --> 08:41.562
and take care
of your little sister too, OK?

08:41.646 --> 08:43.856
If anything happens,
you tell Dad or me.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.818
What are you doing?

09:00.748 --> 09:04.418
You told me you were going
to take on an office job.

09:04.502 --> 09:05.753
Remember?

09:07.296 --> 09:09.465
You said it would be
all about interviewing?

09:09.548 --> 09:12.718
Helping people who were
victims of harassment,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.553
not receiving threats.

09:14.637 --> 09:17.014
I never thought
this would happen, I'm sorry.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.557
But it happened.

09:18.641 --> 09:19.809
It happened!

09:20.935 --> 09:22.645
Anyway, I have everything
sorted out.

09:22.728 --> 09:25.022
I talked to my mom
and she's expecting us tomorrow.

09:25.731 --> 09:27.525
-Excuse me?
-Carla.

09:27.608 --> 09:28.943
Some psycho tattooed a wolf

09:29.026 --> 09:30.528
-on our daughter's neck!
-I know!

09:30.611 --> 09:32.863
Don't you think I want them
as far away as possible?

09:32.947 --> 09:34.198
You want me to lose my job?

09:34.282 --> 09:36.284
Or your job?
For all this to fall apart?

09:36.367 --> 09:37.952
Fuck my job!

09:38.035 --> 09:40.705
Fuck your job too!
I don't give a shit!

09:40.788 --> 09:43.249
What do you want?
Our girls locked up all day?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.710
-With police officers?
-I can't leave the case

09:45.793 --> 09:47.503
at this point.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.547
It's hard for me
to leave my job, too.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.550
After what happened I'll do it.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.096
Carla, I'm not asking you to quit.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.475
But I... I have a limit,

10:01.559 --> 10:03.144
and that limit is my daughters.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.788
Gonzalo?

10:22.872 --> 10:24.915
I'm sending a patrol car for you.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.460
-Why?
-<i>Just to be safe.</i>

10:29.295 --> 10:31.213
But you've never done that.

10:31.297 --> 10:32.465
<i>No, I know.</i>

10:32.548 --> 10:34.592
It's just that the case
I'm working on

10:34.675 --> 10:36.802
is looking kind of tricky.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.387
Did something happen?

10:39.221 --> 10:42.475
No, nothing important.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.686
-What happened? Tell me.
<i>-No, it's Dani.</i>

10:45.770 --> 10:49.649
<i>It's nothing serious,</i>
<i>but we have to protect ourselves.</i>

10:51.067 --> 10:52.360
<i>Gonzalo...</i>

10:52.443 --> 10:53.736
Hey!

10:53.819 --> 10:57.615
-Yeah, I'm here.
-No, Dani's fine. I promise.

10:59.575 --> 11:00.826
Um... OK.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.454
I'll lock the house real well,

11:03.537 --> 11:05.164
I'll... I'll stay here.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.583
But, it's just...
Can I please just stay here?

11:07.666 --> 11:11.253
OK, but if anything happens
you call me.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.673
-OK, Bye.
-<i>Good. OK, bye.</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:22.681
Alright, come with me.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.434
Let's let the ladies work
in calm, let's go.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.731
Come on, let's go.

11:30.815 --> 11:33.317
-Carla, I need you to focus.
-How can I focus?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.820
Could you?
That animal touched my daughter!

11:35.903 --> 11:38.072
It's unlikely, Carla,

11:38.155 --> 11:40.408
but my dog and your daughter
are connected events.

11:40.491 --> 11:43.786
Look, let's not compare.
They're completely different.

11:43.869 --> 11:45.746
If you're gonna endure it, fine.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.289
-I'm not going to!
-Calm down.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.707
I understand your rage,

11:48.791 --> 11:50.209
and I know there's fear behind it.

11:50.292 --> 11:52.545
-I'd be scared shitless, too.
-No, it's not fear.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.922
It's so much more than that.
So much more!

12:00.386 --> 12:02.930
I don't think
I should keep doing this.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.766
I personally vow
to take care of your family.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.435
-I promise that nobody...
-How can you promise that?

12:07.518 --> 12:09.353
We don't even know his face!

12:09.437 --> 12:12.356
That fucker could be one of us!
Can't you see?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.816
He infiltrated our family,

12:13.899 --> 12:16.152
he knows our intimacy,
he was in my house!

12:16.235 --> 12:18.028
But he's getting too close, Carla.

12:18.112 --> 12:20.573
He's making mistakes, calm down.

12:20.656 --> 12:21.991
And what do you want?

12:22.074 --> 12:24.285
To use my family as bait?
Is that it?

12:24.368 --> 12:26.620
No, not your family.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.997
But maybe us.

12:30.040 --> 12:33.878
If we get him to hate us enough,
we'll find him.

12:33.961 --> 12:36.797
He's looking for a face-off.

12:36.881 --> 12:38.174
We'll give him one.

12:38.257 --> 12:41.635
Dani is too young to lie
about this kind of thing.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.388
I believe her when she says
she doesn't know who did it.

12:45.681 --> 12:47.349
How wouldn't she, boss?

12:49.143 --> 12:51.312
Because maybe it was done
while she was asleep.

13:00.279 --> 13:02.114

She ran away from home
and left behind a note.

13:17.338 --> 13:19.048
Thanks, Javi.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.425
-OK, I'll go.
-Thanks.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.097
Guys, I got to be with you
through all of this,

13:27.181 --> 13:29.058
and to be honest,

13:29.141 --> 13:31.060
I had never seen
a chain of tragedies

13:31.143 --> 13:32.645
so...devastating.

13:35.356 --> 13:38.067
I came because the board
named me mediator

13:38.150 --> 13:39.902
until we get a new principal.

13:41.362 --> 13:43.697
We'll have activities
for reflection and therapy.

13:43.781 --> 13:47.117
Manuel, that reflecting shit
makes no sense, though.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.619
OK.

13:49.828 --> 13:51.455
Then do whatever you want.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.961
I feel like saying "To hell
with everything," too.

13:58.087 --> 14:00.881
Didn't you notice that I got
beaten up in the parking lot?

14:04.343 --> 14:08.889
Have any of you wondered
what you're really fighting for?

14:10.975 --> 14:14.728
Have you asked yourselves
who the school is?

14:14.812 --> 14:17.439
Hmm? Hmm?

14:17.523 --> 14:18.857
No one?

14:21.193 --> 14:24.405
Is the school a teacher
and a principal who messed up

14:24.488 --> 14:26.240
and lost their way?

14:27.283 --> 14:29.535
A therapist whom you ignore?

14:29.618 --> 14:31.036
No.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.788
You are the school.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.457
Each and every one of you.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.712
Look at Sofia.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.173
Sofia has been
through horrible things, too.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.758
Nonetheless, there she is.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.387
Does anyone know
why Sofia is still here?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.140
-For Blanca!
-For Blanca!

14:51.223 --> 14:52.600
And for Celeste.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.228
If they didn't give up,
neither will we.

14:59.648 --> 15:01.066
That's an answer.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.446
Is that the letter Celeste left?

15:06.614 --> 15:08.532
-Yes.
-Can I see it?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.743
Yes.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.412
Whose idea was it
to offer a reward?

15:13.495 --> 15:17.875
Now everyone's going
to call in fake leads.

15:17.958 --> 15:22.212
We've already lost Blanca,
we can't lose Celeste.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.839
Celeste is very strong.

15:25.424 --> 15:26.884
Like Blanca?

15:26.967 --> 15:28.385
Like you?

15:28.469 --> 15:30.471
Fancying themselves leaders?

15:30.554 --> 15:32.556
Who do you think
they learned that from?

15:32.640 --> 15:36.018
I couldn't be prouder
of my daughters.

15:36.101 --> 15:38.854
-Whatever happens.
-Whatever happens?

15:38.937 --> 15:41.982
-Do you know what's happening?
-[Elisa] Please, calm down.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.487
Here, Ma'am.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.868
-[Elisa] Have you called her?
-[Bruno] She's not picking up.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.121
I know her.

15:57.039 --> 15:59.500
I know her, I know she'll go
straight towards danger.

16:02.336 --> 16:03.754
I'm going to find her.

16:05.839 --> 16:07.091
Both of them.

16:07.174 --> 16:08.550
I'm going to find them.

16:33.575 --> 16:34.618
[cell phone vibrates]

16:34.702 --> 16:35.911
-Elisa.
-<i>Javier.</i>

16:35.994 --> 16:37.746
<i>I need a favor, urgently.</i>

16:37.830 --> 16:40.332
Remember when we started
investigating the Ibarra family?

16:40.416 --> 16:43.127
You had access to Celeste's
phone, remember?

16:43.210 --> 16:45.129
-<i>Well, I need you to track her.</i>
-No.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.297
No, I can't, you know I need

16:47.381 --> 16:49.717
the district attorney's
permission.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.719
This little girl
just ran away from home.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.804
She's putting herself in danger.

16:53.887 --> 16:57.516
If we wait for authorization
it might be too late, understand?

16:59.101 --> 17:00.310
OK.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.980
[Olivia] We can't continue
investigating Belmar's connection.

17:05.023 --> 17:06.316
What are you talking about?

17:07.943 --> 17:10.320
It turned out to be a dead end.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.491
Nothing indicates he's involved
with Blanca's disappearance.

17:15.325 --> 17:19.455
Belmar was on the front page
of every newspaper.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.540
The Secretary called
to congratulate me, Olivia.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.543
You like it.

17:25.419 --> 17:26.670
What?

17:26.754 --> 17:29.673
Are we working to please
the Secretary or to find Blanca?

17:29.757 --> 17:32.551
The investigation
was almost closed.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.471
I know you don't like to work
with the press around,

17:35.554 --> 17:38.140
but that's the only reason
the investigation's still open.

17:38.223 --> 17:42.603
And you can't just toss Belmar out
to chase some Boogeyman.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.355
Because there's no...
Listen to me!

17:45.439 --> 17:47.941
There's no concrete evidence
whatsoever

17:48.025 --> 17:50.027
of the game, or The Wolf--

17:50.110 --> 17:52.529
Tell that to Carla.
Tell that to Carla's daughter.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.740
We and our children
are being threatened,

17:54.823 --> 17:56.033
and to you it's the Boogeyman.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.409
You think this is a joke?

17:58.160 --> 17:59.703
No, I don't.

17:59.787 --> 18:02.623
I take this case a lot
more seriously than you think.

18:04.875 --> 18:09.296
That's why I'm thinking
that it might be time

18:09.379 --> 18:12.674
to take a step back, Olivia.
I'm trying to protect you!

18:12.758 --> 18:15.469
I don't need
that kind of protection!

18:15.552 --> 18:17.679
I don't need you to protect me!

18:17.763 --> 18:19.056
I've never needed that!

18:22.810 --> 18:25.354
-What the hell do you want?
-Support.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.775
Support to find
Blanca and Celeste.

19:22.369 --> 19:23.996
[echoing groans]

19:26.999 --> 19:28.375
[sobs]

19:37.509 --> 19:39.177
[howls and sobs]

19:45.267 --> 19:47.394
-[clattering]
-[Celeste gasps]

19:49.313 --> 19:50.939
Don't point that at me.

19:53.859 --> 19:56.278
We believers
in the Godliest of Gods

19:56.361 --> 19:58.196
aren't afraid of bullets.

19:58.280 --> 19:59.823
We've spoken to the mayor--

19:59.907 --> 20:01.992
Where's the girl
who used to be tied up here?

20:02.075 --> 20:05.746
The monkeys... believe
that black magic

20:05.829 --> 20:07.331
makes them mysterious.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.749
Who else comes here?

20:08.832 --> 20:12.878
What they did to the virgin girl
is unforgivable.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.925
They brought her here
to make their nasty movie...

20:18.008 --> 20:20.510
What did they do?
Did they record a video here?

20:21.553 --> 20:23.555
They kicked me out of my own home.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.182
What were they like?

20:26.934 --> 20:28.936
I only saw one.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.647
He worked for the engineers,

20:31.730 --> 20:34.399
and he had the mark of the beast.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.366
And do you know where
I can find them?

20:49.456 --> 20:51.041
[Javi] I knew I'd find you here.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.128
I thought you'd quit.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.215
This is called
picking your own battles.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.725
We identified our first Jane Doe.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.521
Paola Suarez.

21:18.360 --> 21:20.153
Punta Arenas?

21:20.237 --> 21:22.781
That's why we couldn't
identify her earlier.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.324
She was out of the radar.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.578
She went to a private school,
a Catholic one as well,

21:28.662 --> 21:31.581
and had supposedly gone camping
over the weekend.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.167
So no one expected her
to be in Santiago.

21:34.251 --> 21:38.547
-And how did she get here?
-It's common in grooming cases.

21:38.630 --> 21:40.632
Someone probably liked her photos,

21:40.716 --> 21:42.592
contacted her online...

21:42.676 --> 21:46.471
Invited her on a romantic getaway
behind her parents' backs,

21:46.555 --> 21:47.848
and bought her plane tickets.

21:47.931 --> 21:50.559
-Did you check her social media?
-Yes.

21:51.518 --> 21:54.062
One of her admirers
was from Santiago.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.480
Plays rugby.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.483
He left her
several public messages

21:58.567 --> 21:59.860
before she disappeared.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.070
And I looked him up.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.698
Augusto.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.535
This means we can reopen the case.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.328
That's still tough.

22:10.412 --> 22:13.415
The district attorney will say
it's circumstantial, but...

22:14.791 --> 22:16.752
-We have to keep looking.
-Good.

22:16.835 --> 22:17.878
Nice one.

22:19.379 --> 22:20.380
May I?

22:21.882 --> 22:24.051
I don't want to lead you astray.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.011
I'd follow you.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.848
Hmm.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.484
I have to go talk to Jorquera.

22:41.693 --> 22:42.944
He already left.

22:44.321 --> 22:45.864
And you should follow suit.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.784
Go home.

22:48.867 --> 22:51.578
Rest. Eat.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.288
Be with your son a little while.

22:53.371 --> 22:55.415
Don't be an insubordinate
subordinate.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.375
[chuckles]

23:12.474 --> 23:15.310
-[baby cries]
-There, there, here we are.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.604
Alright, baby.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.690
Calm down. [shushes]

23:25.028 --> 23:27.072
She won't stop crying this time.

23:27.155 --> 23:28.448
-Mommy?
-What is it?

23:28.532 --> 23:29.825
Why aren't you coming?

23:30.951 --> 23:33.495
Because I still have
things to sort out here.

23:33.578 --> 23:34.663
So I can't go with you.

23:34.746 --> 23:36.998
But I'll call you every day,
mouse, OK?

23:37.082 --> 23:38.291
-OK.
-Every day.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.544
Hey, get in the car.

23:48.051 --> 23:50.387
I do disagree
with you leaving at this hour

23:50.470 --> 23:52.180
because it'll get dark
and that's dangerous.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.433
No, it's just three hours,
less. It'll be fine.

23:55.517 --> 23:56.810
I'll call as soon as I arrive, OK?

23:56.893 --> 23:57.978
OK.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.484
Hey, they're what matters here.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.905
Leave all this shit
and come back with us.

24:08.989 --> 24:10.115
OK?

24:24.796 --> 24:26.631
[Elisa] Javi, did you get
what I asked for?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.884
I need it right now, thanks.

24:39.603 --> 24:40.937
[typing]

24:45.650 --> 24:47.611
[youths chatting and laughing]

24:49.696 --> 24:51.281
[boy] Check this out, man.

24:59.873 --> 25:04.794
-[all] Aw!
-See? I should teach classes.

25:04.878 --> 25:06.630
Yeah, you should go pro,

25:06.713 --> 25:08.048
we can all live off your salary.

25:08.131 --> 25:11.468
Yeah, take one for the team.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.637
What do you think I'm doing
even playing with you?

25:14.596 --> 25:16.640
-You're mean.
-Watch out.

25:20.435 --> 25:21.811
Hi, guys.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.730
What are you up to?

25:23.813 --> 25:26.858
-Not a thing, bored.
-Bored.

25:26.942 --> 25:28.860
Bored with what?
You're young, man.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.654
-Hey...
-[boy] Can you spare some change?

25:30.737 --> 25:31.988
No.

25:32.072 --> 25:34.115
We can spare a lot more
than some change.

25:34.199 --> 25:37.827
-But the best we have is a party.
-Party!

25:37.911 --> 25:40.247
-Do you want to go to a party?
-Have some fun?

25:40.330 --> 25:43.416
[man 1] You like parties,
I could bet on it.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.335
[man 2]
This one looks like a party girl.

25:45.418 --> 25:47.128
-[boy] I'm in.
-[man 1] Get in the car.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.546
[man 2] Come on!

25:48.630 --> 25:51.258
[man 1]
Get in! What could go wrong?

25:51.341 --> 25:54.010
-[man 2] Let's go!
-[man 1] Get in the car!

25:54.094 --> 25:57.055
[man 1]
Come on, don't be shy, honey.

25:57.138 --> 25:58.765
We're certainly not.

26:10.694 --> 26:12.320
[overlapping chatter]

26:59.993 --> 27:02.120
[door closes, lock clicks]

27:02.954 --> 27:04.706
-Are you lost?
-I'm going to the bathroom.

27:04.789 --> 27:05.915
The bathroom.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.545
-Do you like my house?
-No.

27:11.254 --> 27:14.966
It's been in decoration
and mansion magazines.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.885
Oh, then I like it.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.137
Ha!

27:20.180 --> 27:21.306
You're sarcastic.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.351
I like that, it's OK.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.435
Come.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.148
Come here. Please, just relax.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.610
Do you really think it's...

27:34.527 --> 27:35.737
normal...

27:36.529 --> 27:40.200
for a person like me
to invite you to his home?

27:41.409 --> 27:43.036
He gives you his trust,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.164
and you steal from him?

27:47.916 --> 27:49.959
Do you think that's OK?

27:50.043 --> 27:52.962
Why don't you let go of me,
you nasty old fucker?

27:53.046 --> 27:56.633
"Nasty old fucker."
That's rude, seriously.

27:56.716 --> 27:58.593
What you just said is rude.

27:59.594 --> 28:02.931
I could call the police,
but...I don't want to.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.143
Now, what I do want...

28:07.227 --> 28:10.230
is for you and I
to become friends.

28:11.439 --> 28:13.400
And that changes things,
you get me?

28:13.483 --> 28:16.319
Because if you and I...

28:17.445 --> 28:19.823
were to become friends,

28:20.615 --> 28:23.243
it would all be different,
because...

28:24.160 --> 28:27.539
one tolerates certain things
from one's friends, you know?

28:28.832 --> 28:31.084
You accept things from friends,

28:31.167 --> 28:37.298
you have secrets
that you only have with friends.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.343
Do you understand?
Keep calm, don't worry.

28:40.427 --> 28:42.429
You have to relax.

29:12.375 --> 29:13.585
Hi.

29:13.668 --> 29:16.921
Thanks for coming,
and I'm sorry it's late.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.715
What happened?

29:18.798 --> 29:20.633
Benjamín's parents talked to me.

29:22.051 --> 29:23.344
It seems he wants to confess.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.221
Actually, he wanted
to do it tonight.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.265
I asked him to wait for me
until tomorrow morning.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.726
Are you OK?

29:47.118 --> 29:49.662
Anyway, I don't think
Benjamín will be any use to us.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.625
Maybe, but isn't it worth
listening to him?

29:53.708 --> 29:55.668
For me, that boy has no character.

29:56.586 --> 29:57.837
He's a pawn.

29:58.713 --> 30:00.632
He couldn't help us
if he wanted to.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.637
Why are you so sure?

30:06.387 --> 30:07.972
Because that bastard's invisible.

30:09.724 --> 30:11.059
There's no catching him.

30:12.018 --> 30:13.728
You don't know that yet.

30:15.813 --> 30:18.983
In any case,
I said I'd talk to Benjamín.

30:20.401 --> 30:23.321
All I asked was
for a PDI agent to be present,

30:23.404 --> 30:24.906
and I'd like it to be you.

30:27.367 --> 30:29.077
I'll be resigning tomorrow,

30:29.160 --> 30:31.579
so chances are another officer
will be with you.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.502

30:49.430 --> 30:50.890
Nothing happened to me,

30:52.100 --> 30:53.685
but my little girl...

30:56.646 --> 30:59.482
Some son of a bitch marked her
with The Wolf's symbol.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.282
How?

31:11.536 --> 31:13.496
I have no fucking idea.

31:15.081 --> 31:20.712
I think maybe during her nap
at daycare, I don't know.

31:22.630 --> 31:25.216
But I'm completely
to blame for what happened.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.261
-No, that's not your fault.
-Yes, yes.

31:28.344 --> 31:32.015
My job is to stop these people
and I couldn't face that fucker.

31:34.934 --> 31:36.144
And now I feel as if...

31:37.353 --> 31:39.439
As if my body were shaking
all the time

31:39.522 --> 31:42.900
and it's a feeling
I've never experienced before.

31:49.532 --> 31:51.075
I'm sorry.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.869

31:52.952 --> 31:54.162

31:58.708 --> 32:00.168

32:01.085 --> 32:04.297

32:05.632 --> 32:07.133
To see you humiliated...

32:08.092 --> 32:09.302
defeated.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.514
But if you don't allow it,
he won't win.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.101
So don't give it to him.

32:21.314 --> 32:23.941
I think you can take
much more than this.

32:24.025 --> 32:25.276
Right?

I'm sorry.

That should have been expected.

33:36.764 --> 33:38.891
[Petersen] I believe he's
preparing something else.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.768
A final strike, hmm?

33:42.395 --> 33:45.022
The only thing I care about
is how I can find him.

33:45.106 --> 33:47.150
I think that you know where,

33:47.817 --> 33:49.444
and that's why you're here.

33:49.527 --> 33:53.072
Don't act like other cops,
you are not like that.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.574

-No.

33:54.657 --> 33:55.700
Then, who am I?

You're the only one who knows
what Blanca is feeling right now.

that kind of vulnerability.

I also know...

that you came to ask
for my forgiveness.

34:46.584 --> 34:48.586
[tearfully] It wasn't my fault.

34:48.669 --> 34:50.379
No, of course not.

You did what you had to do.

I was just angry.

37:34.710 --> 37:37.213
I wanted to stop being treated

At her grandparents' house,
with Marcos.

38:24.719 --> 38:27.138
I'm leaving the case, Olivia.

38:27.221 --> 38:29.390
Carla, you're my best agent.

38:29.473 --> 38:32.727
I think I was very lucky
to have a boss like you...

38:32.810 --> 38:35.021
OK, come on in.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.856
But I can't...

38:37.732 --> 38:39.900
I can't go on,
because my daughters are in danger

38:39.984 --> 38:43.195
and I'm ashamed to even look
Marcos in the face.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.114
And I've been erratic.

38:46.532 --> 38:47.992
I've been too erratic.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.538
Since this morning,
nothing's been clear.

I'm just making
all these mistakes.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.209
We all make mistakes, Carla.

38:57.293 --> 39:00.588
Yes, but my mistakes
are unforgivable.

39:02.465 --> 39:03.883
I went to the daycare.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.011
I checked the cameras
with the inspector,

39:07.094 --> 39:08.387
and it wasn't there.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.640
I've just been playing it
over and over in my mind

39:11.724 --> 39:15.144
because I thought
about the chain of events

39:15.227 --> 39:19.648
and I did her hair that morning
and there was no mark.

39:19.732 --> 39:21.567
It wasn't at daycare.

39:21.650 --> 39:23.736
Marcos took her straight home.

39:23.819 --> 39:27.656
So she wasn't with strangers
at any moment, only with us.

-Gonzalo.

Dani didn't get that mark
at daycare.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.716
It was at your house.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.677
-Gonzalo gave it to her.
-Mom!

39:49.887 --> 39:52.223
We can't live with a secret
like that, Gonzalo.

39:52.306 --> 39:53.724
You can't and I can't.

39:55.684 --> 39:58.312
If we get through this,
it'll be by telling the truth.

40:01.232 --> 40:03.901
Gonzalo has been playing
The Wolf Game.

40:03.984 --> 40:05.986
That was a test.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.618
You did that to my daughter?

40:14.161 --> 40:15.454
It was a game.

they're the victims?

not your son!

that Gonzalo is a child, too.

41:00.499 --> 41:01.959
He's my child.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.962
I know it's not a valid argument,

41:05.045 --> 41:06.964

what he's done.
