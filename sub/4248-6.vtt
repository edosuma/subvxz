WEBVTT

00:31.281 --> 00:33.199
(owl hoots)

00:33.575 --> 00:38.037
{\an5}I SAW HIM OUTSIDE THE
DOOR AND HE WAS
STARING RIGHT AT ME.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.205
YOU BELIEVE ME DON'T
YOU?

00:39.289 --> 00:41.958
{\an1}OF COURSE.

00:42.041 --> 00:47.630
{\an4}PERHAPS WE SHOULD ASSUME
IT WAS A TYPICAL DORMITORY
PRANK, VICTOR?

00:47.714 --> 00:49.674
A REASSURING THEORY,
SERGEANT.

00:49.758 --> 00:55.722
{\an1}BUT YOU'LL UNDERSTAND MY
DESIRE TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.868
WHY AREN'T YOU DRESSED?

01:16.951 --> 01:19.621
SHE'S NOT GOING TO
SCHOOL TODAY.

01:19.704 --> 01:21.289
I HAVE WORK TO DO
AROUND THE HOUSE.

01:21.372 --> 01:24.501
{\an4}I CANNOT DO IT IF THERE ARE
STUDENTS RUSTLING ABOUT THE
PLACE.

01:24.584 --> 01:30.215
{\an5}YES, STUDENTS CAN BE
SUCH A BOTHER. WELL YOU
DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

01:30.298 --> 01:33.927
{\an5}SHE'LL HARDLY BE RUSTLING
AROUND: THE POOR GIRL'S
EXHAUSTED!

01:34.010 --> 01:36.221
A DAY OFF WON'T
HURT ANYBODY.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.013
NO, IT'S FINE, TRUDY
I'D RATHER JUST...

01:37.096 --> 01:40.183
NO, NONSENSE. YOU
HARDLY SLEPT A WINK.

01:40.266 --> 01:46.356
YOU NEED REST, AND PERHAPS
A DOSE OF DAYTIME TV.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.947
{\an4}I COULD DO WITH ANOTHER
THREE HOURS SLEEP IN - I'M
SPENT.

01:54.030 --> 01:57.033
DO YOU THINK SHE REALLY
DID SEE A G-O-S-T.?

01:57.116 --> 02:00.286
{\an5}NO. NOTHING WOULD
GET PAST VICTOR THE
DEATH-WATCH BEETLE.

02:00.370 --> 02:04.624
{\an5}HE WOULD SCARE A
GHOST TO DEATH. WHERE
DO YOU WANNA SIT?

02:05.625 --> 02:08.461
{\an4}HEY NEENS, I'VE GOT
SOMETHING THAT IS GOING
TO HELP US FIND TREASURE.

02:08.544 --> 02:09.963
TA-DA!

02:10.045 --> 02:11.339
AN MP3 PLAYER?

02:11.422 --> 02:14.968
{\an4}A STATE OF THE ART MP3 PLAYER,
WHICH ALSO WORKS AS A DIGITAL
RECORDER.

02:15.051 --> 02:18.721
{\an4}MY DAD THOUGHT I MIGHT USE
IT FOR HOMEWORK REVISION.
LIKE THAT WOULD HAPPEN.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.182
I'M SORRY, AMBER,
BUT YOU LOST ME.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.434
{\an1}SOMETIMES YOU ARE
SO SLOW, NINA.

02:23.518 --> 02:25.728
{\an1}WE CAN RECORD ALL THAT STUFF
FROM THOSE SPHERICALS ONTO IT.

02:25.812 --> 02:26.229
CYLINDERS...

02:26.312 --> 02:28.064
THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

02:28.147 --> 02:31.359
{\an4}SAVE US FROM GOING UP AND
DOWN THE CREEPY ATTIC
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.988
{\an5}AMBER, I'M NOT GOING
TO SAY THIS A LOT, BUT
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

02:35.071 --> 02:38.616
{\an1}WHAT WAS THAT, NINA? YOU
THINK I'M A GENIUS?

02:38.700 --> 02:41.703
UNTIL NOW. JUST, SHH.

02:41.786 --> 02:44.706
{\an4}(Whispers) I THINK THE BLING
MUST BE HIDDEN BEHIND
ANOTHER SECRET PANEL,

02:44.789 --> 02:46.958
{\an1}LIKE THE ONE IN THE ATTIC.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:47.041 --> 02:52.797
{\an4}I THINK YOU MAY BE RIGHT,
BUT MAYBE WE TALK ABOUT THIS
SOMEWHERE MORE PRIVATE.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.382
<i>MORNING, EVERYBODY.</i>

02:54.465 --> 02:55.383
(everyone)
MORNING, MRS ANDREWS.

02:55.466 --> 02:59.387
{\an1}I HAVE YOUR FRENCH TEST
PAPERS TO HAND BACK HERE.

03:04.601 --> 03:11.441
{\an1}I GOT AN A? I GOT AN A!
WA-HEY-HEY!

03:11.524 --> 03:13.318
I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT.

03:13.401 --> 03:14.569
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:14.652 --> 03:18.031
{\an3}I GOT AN A!

03:14.652 --> 03:18.031
WHAT?

03:18.114 --> 03:20.909
I'M SURE I DIDN'T GET
ALL OF THESE. BUT,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.160
MAYBE I JUST, DID SOME
REALLY GOOD GUESSES?

03:22.243 --> 03:24.412
{\an5}STRANGER THINGS HAVE
HAPPENED, EH, MARA?

03:22.243 --> 03:24.412
{\an1}HUH?

03:24.495 --> 03:29.792
<i>OKAY, SETTLE DOWN PLEASE.</i>
<i>AMBER, BACK TO YOUR SEAT.</i>

03:32.170 --> 03:34.964
{\an1}HOW NICE OF YOU TO POP
IN TO SEE PATRICIA.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.592
I SUPPOSE DRAMA CLASS IS
LACKING A LITTLE DRAMA...

03:37.675 --> 03:39.761
NOW THAT SHE'S OFF SCHOOL.

03:39.844 --> 03:41.095
HEY PATRICIA.

03:41.179 --> 03:41.971
HI MR WINKLER.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.640
HOW ARE YOU FEELING? I
HEARD ABOUT...

03:43.723 --> 03:47.894
{\an4}FINE. I MEAN, SCARED, BUT AT
LEAST THIS PROVES ONE THING,
DOESN'T IT?

03:47.977 --> 03:52.148
THE MAN... HE'S NOT IN MY HEAD.

03:52.231 --> 03:58.154
{\an5}THING IS PATRICIA, NO-ONE
ELSE SAW HIM. YOU DO KNOW
THAT, DON'T YOU?

03:58.237 --> 03:59.656
THE POLICE COULDN'T FIND
ANYTHING EITHER.

03:59.739 --> 04:05.286
{\an4}THE POLICE ARE IN ON IT. I TOLD
YOU. YOU SAID YESTERDAY YOU
BELIEVED ME.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.412
{\an3}AND I DO.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.246
{\an3}AND I DO.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.246
LIAR.

04:07.330 --> 04:10.249
I DO! I'TS JUST. I'M
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

04:10.333 --> 04:15.296
YEAH, WELL, JOIN THE CLUB.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT ME TOO.

04:19.466 --> 04:21.427
DESCRIBE HIM TO ME, YEAH?

04:21.511 --> 04:22.387
DESCRIBE TO ME THE
MAN THAT YOU SAW,

04:22.470 --> 04:27.767
{\an1}AND I PROMISE YOU I WILL TRY
TO GET SOME ANSWERS.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.854
{\an5}I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW I
MANAGED TO GET ALL THAT
STUFF ON THEM.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.566
{\an4}IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE
THAT ONE SHOE COULD STEP IN
SO MUCH GUM.

04:35.650 --> 04:37.110
JUST UNLUCKY I GUESS.

04:37.193 --> 04:38.361
<i>ANYONE SEEN MY GUM?</i>

04:38.444 --> 04:42.198
{\an1}AH. THOUGHT I'D LEFT IT
IN THE SCIENCE LAB!

04:42.281 --> 04:43.032
{\an1}ALFIE, NO!

04:43.116 --> 04:45.159
(Jerome laughs)

04:45.243 --> 04:47.787
{\an1}HEY MARA, WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND MICK?

04:47.870 --> 04:49.122
YOU WERE ACTING VERY
STRANGE EARLIER?

04:49.205 --> 04:53.543
{\an4}NOTHING. AMBER, PLEASE. LET
IT GO. I'M NOT EVEN TUTORING
HIM ANYMORE.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.672
HEY! THAT'S PRIVATE!

04:58.965 --> 05:01.592
{\an4}FUNNY. YOU AND MICK MUST BE
LIKE, PSYCHICALLY LINKED OR
SOMETHING.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.177
BUSTED.

05:03.261 --> 05:03.886
YOU CREEP! YOU DID THIS.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.639
I NEVER SAID A WORD.
PROMISE.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.474
WHY ARE YOU CALLING HIM A
CREEP? YOU'RE THE CREEP.

05:08.558 --> 05:10.268
{\an1}STEALING MY BOYFRIEND BY
HELPING HIM CHEAT.

05:10.351 --> 05:13.688
{\an4}I'M NOT STEALING YOUR
BOYFRIEND! AND MICK DOESN'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!

05:13.771 --> 05:16.649
WHAT? I DON'T GET IT.

05:16.733 --> 05:20.653
I LOVE THIS PART. SHE DID
IT FOR HIM SECRETLY.

05:20.737 --> 05:25.491
{\an5}YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE. DID
YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD
GET MICK BY DOING THAT?

05:25.575 --> 05:27.243
(Mara screams)

05:27.326 --> 05:28.911
DING, DONG! ROUND ONE!

05:28.995 --> 05:30.121
WHOAH! CAT FIGHT.

05:30.204 --> 05:34.876
LET HER GO. DON'T JUST
SIT THERE, YOU IDIOT.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.919
GET OFF ME!

05:37.003 --> 05:37.837
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.505
THAT'S RIGHT TAKE HER SIDE.

05:39.589 --> 05:44.260
{\an5}JUST BECAUSE SHE CHEATED
FOR YOU DOESN'T MEAN YOU
HAVE TO DEFEND HER.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.970
IS THIS TRUE?

05:46.054 --> 05:49.098
{\an4}I WAS JUST TRYING TO
HELP. YOUR ANSWERS
WERE SO...WRONG.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.602
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I'M SO THICK...

05:52.685 --> 05:54.103
{\an1}THAT I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
WITHOUT YOUR HELP?

05:54.187 --> 05:57.774
{\an1}NO, OF COURSE NOT. NOT
"ANYTHING."

05:57.857 --> 06:01.194
{\an1}I COULD GET KICKED OUT OF
SCHOOL FOR THIS.

06:03.237 --> 06:05.406
COME ON.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.452
MARA. YOU MISSED A SPOT.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.250
"ONE WOE DOTH TREAD UPON
ANOTHER'S HEEL".

06:16.334 --> 06:18.669
"SO FAST THEY FOLLOW".

06:18.753 --> 06:20.505
HOW CAN I HELP YOU,
MR WINKLER?

06:20.588 --> 06:22.673
{\an1}UM, I'M WORRIED ABOUT
PATRICIA WILLIAMSON

06:22.757 --> 06:25.468
AND I WAS HOPING YOU MIGHT BE
ABLE TO GIVE ME SOME ADVICE.

06:25.551 --> 06:29.430
{\an1}SHE SEEMS TO THINK THAT A
FRIEND OF HERS HAS DISAPPEARED,

06:29.514 --> 06:32.683
{\an1}JOY MERCER. SHE THINKS SHE'S
BEEN REMOVED OR KIDNAPPED.

06:32.767 --> 06:37.605
{\an5}LET ME GIVE YOU A WORD OF
ADVICE, JASON. PATRICIA
IS A LOVELY GIRL,

06:37.688 --> 06:40.358
BUT SHE HAS A VERY
VIVID IMAGINATION.

06:40.441 --> 06:41.943
I JUST THINK IT MIGHT HELP IF
SHE COULD SPEAK TO THIS JOY.

06:42.026 --> 06:45.696
CALL HER AT HOME PERHAPS?

06:45.780 --> 06:48.074
AH, MICK, COME IN, WHAT
CAN I DO FOR YOU?

06:48.157 --> 06:51.452
{\an5}WE'LL CONTINUE THIS
CONVERSATION ANOTHER
TIME MR WINKLER.

06:54.705 --> 06:57.291
I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT THE FRENCH TEST.

06:57.375 --> 07:03.840
{\an1}I UM, I DIDN'T DESERVE
THE 'A'. I CHEATED.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.091
AH.

07:05.174 --> 07:10.847
NO HE DIDN'T. TECHNICALLY, HE
DIDN'T CHEAT, MISS. IT WAS ME.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.058
{\an1}I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU WERE
GOING TO COME CLEAN MARA.

07:14.142 --> 07:15.518
YOU KNEW?

07:15.601 --> 07:19.772
{\an5}THERE WAS ONLY ONE OTHER
PERSON WITH THE SAME HIGH
MARK AS YOU, MICK.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.191
IS MR SWEET GOING
TO EXPEL ME?

07:22.275 --> 07:29.157
{\an4}NO. BUT I'D THINK VERY
SERIOUSLY ABOUT DOING ANYTHING
LIKE THIS AGAIN IF I WERE YOU.

07:29.240 --> 07:32.535
{\an1}AND MICK, YOU WILL HAVE
TO RE-TAKE THE TEST.

07:32.618 --> 07:33.911
OF COURSE.

07:33.995 --> 07:35.454
OKAY THEN.

07:36.956 --> 07:38.374
MICK, I'M SO SORRY ...

07:38.457 --> 07:44.672
{\an1}SAVE IT MARA. MRS ANDREWS MAY
HAVE YOUR BACK BUT I DON'T.

07:52.597 --> 07:56.475
{\an4}IT'S ALL RIGHT, PATRICIA. I
JUST NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU
ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

07:56.559 --> 07:58.144
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.898
{\an4}CAN YOU DESCRIBE TO ME
EXACTLY WHAT THIS MAN LOOKS
LIKE? IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.776
GET AWAY FROM ME!

08:07.737 --> 08:09.906
WOAH, PATRICIA? ARE YOU OKAY?

08:09.989 --> 08:14.035
{\an4}LET ME GUESS. LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE IN THIS PLACE YOU'RE
"WORRIED ABOUT ME".

08:14.118 --> 08:21.250
{\an5}WELL I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU
ALL THINK OF ME! I KNOW
THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON.

08:23.127 --> 08:27.006
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:30.468 --> 08:33.429
{\an1}(Whispering) SEARCHING FOR
THE YOU KNOW WHAT.

08:33.511 --> 08:36.974
{\an1}(Whispering) WELL DO IT
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

08:38.183 --> 08:40.727
(twig snaps)

08:42.688 --> 08:43.438
PATRICIA.

08:43.522 --> 08:49.070
NO, GET WAY FROM ME.
LEAVE ME ALONE.

08:49.570 --> 08:52.823
(knock knock knock)

08:53.074 --> 08:54.116
AMBER?

08:54.200 --> 08:54.659
WHAT?

08:54.742 --> 08:56.410
IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING.

08:56.494 --> 09:01.249
{\an4}AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND
ANYTHING BY KNOCKING ON THE
FLOOR LIKE THAT.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.589
(Knock knock knock)

09:12.927 --> 09:16.639
(Gasps) NINA, LOOK!

09:17.431 --> 09:20.810
"HELP ME. SARAH
FROBISHER-SMYTHE."

09:20.893 --> 09:22.645
OKAY, GOOD KNOCKING,
AMBER.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.522
{\an1}THE FROBISHER-SMYTHES ARE THAT
MISERABLE-LOOKING COUPLE

09:24.605 --> 09:26.816
FROM THE PICTURE IN THE
LIVING ROOM AREN'T THEY?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.776
SARAH MUST BE THEIR DAUGHTER.

09:28.859 --> 09:31.779
{\an1}THE OLD LADY AT THE HOUSE.
SHE'S CALLED SARAH.

09:31.862 --> 09:34.949
{\an1}NO WAY! SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE
IS STILL ALIVE?

09:35.032 --> 09:37.785
{\an1}LET'S GO AND TALK TO HER THEN,
SHE MIGHT KNOW SOMETHING.

09:37.868 --> 09:41.330
I'VE TRIED, AMBER BUT,
SHE'S NOT QUITE WITH IT.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.500
OH. SAD.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.460
SHE SAID THERE WAS
EVIL IN THIS HOUSE.

09:46.544 --> 09:51.841
{\an1}POOR SARAH. WHAT WAS
SHE SO AFRAID OF?

09:51.924 --> 09:55.553
I KNOW ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

09:57.305 --> 10:02.143
{\an4}<i>(girl's voice) "MOTHER AND</i>
<i>FATHER HAS GIVEN THE HOUSE</i>
<i>A NAME, ANUBIS.</i>

10:02.226 --> 10:05.187
<i>I THINK IT'S EGYPTIAN."</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:09.358
{\an1}NINA, TELL ME A STORY ABOUT
SOMETHING NICE, PLEASE?

10:09.442 --> 10:16.490
{\an4}OKAY, AMBER... THESE ARE THE
RULES. WE SIT AND RECORD
EVERY SINGLE CYLINDER,

10:16.574 --> 10:18.075
IN SILENCE.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.162
{\an5}EVEN THOUGH IT'S FUZZY, WE
NEED TOTAL SILENCE TO BE
ABLE TO CLEAR IT LATER.

10:21.245 --> 10:22.538
OKAY?

10:22.621 --> 10:30.629
OKAY. SORRY. SILENCE..

10:30.713 --> 10:32.840
<i>(girl's voice) "I WISH MY</i>
<i>PARENTS COULD COME BACK...</i>

10:32.923 --> 10:35.593

10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
<i>BUT I KNOW THEY'RE NOT THERE.</i>

10:37.303 --> 10:39.680
<i>AND I KNOW IT WASN'T</i>
<i>AN ACCIDENT.</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:41.557
<i>HE DID IT. HE MURDERED THEM."</i>

10:41.640 --> 10:43.893
(gasps)

10:43.976 --> 10:47.938
MURDERED?

11:05.623 --> 11:08.167
SORRY I'M LATE, MR WINKLER.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.004
{\an1}RIGHT, EVERYONE SETTLE DOWN,
PLEASE?

11:12.088 --> 11:14.757
{\an1}OKAY, BEFORE WE START
THE CLASS,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.760
{\an4}THE SCHOOL IS HAVING A
PROSPECTIVE PARENTS
DAY NEXT WEEK

11:17.843 --> 11:21.639
{\an5}AND I WOULD LIKE SOME
VOLUNTEERS TO HELP ME
SHOW THE OUTSIDE WORLD

11:21.722 --> 11:25.559
WHAT A TALENTED
BUNCH YOU ALL ARE.

11:26.185 --> 11:27.436
QUIETLY! TAKE A SEAT.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.271
AW MAN - MISS ROBINSON.

11:29.355 --> 11:33.192
ERM, MISS ROBINSON, I'M IN
THE MIDDLE OF A CLASS HERE.

11:33.275 --> 11:34.902
{\an1}THIS IS MY CLASSROOM,
MR WINKLER.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.571
IF YOU LOOK ON THE TIMETABLE,
I'VE HAD IT BOOKED FOR WEEKS.

11:37.655 --> 11:38.072
SHALL WE.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.075
I DON'T THINK SO.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.411
OKAY, QUIET EVERYONE PLEASE.

11:43.494 --> 11:48.624
{\an1}CAN YOU GO TO THE DRAMA STUDIO
AND WE'LL CARRY ON THERE.

11:52.086 --> 11:52.503
ARGH!

11:52.586 --> 11:54.380
(Everyone laughs)

11:54.463 --> 11:59.176
RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
MR WINKLER.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.137
I SAW HIM AGAIN YOU KNOW.

12:01.220 --> 12:06.934
{\an4}THE MAN. AND I DON'T THINK
HE'S A GHOST ANY MORE. I
THINK HE'S REAL.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.152
{\an1}(quietly) I'M GOING
TO VISIT SARAH.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.653
{\an1}IF SHE IS THE GIRL ON THE
RECORDINGS,

12:17.736 --> 12:20.364
{\an1}THEN MAYBE SHE CAN TELL US
SOMETHING ABOUT THE MURDERER.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.657
DO YOU WANT ME TO
COME WITH YOU?

12:21.740 --> 12:25.035
I DO, BUT REMEMBER HOW MUCH
SHE FREAKED OUT LAST TIME.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.163
I THINK I SHOULD GO ALONE.
THERE'LL BE LESS SCREAMING.

12:27.246 --> 12:30.708
{\an5}YEAH. I NEED TO HAVE
ANOTHER CRACK AT THIS.
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD.

12:30.791 --> 12:34.086
WHAT ARE YOU TWO WHISPERING
ABOUT? WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:34.170 --> 12:36.005
NOWHERE.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.299
{\an1}OH. SORRY, OF COURSE.
NOWHERE. TOTALLY.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.633
{\an1}DO YOU FANCY GOING INTO TOWN
LATER BABE?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.218
WE'VE BOTH GOT FREE PERIODS
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE WE COULD.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.472
HEY! CHECK OUT MY NEW
PLAYLIST. IT'S MAJOR.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.557
(quietly) I'M GOING TO THE
HOME TO VISIT SARAH.

12:46.640 --> 12:50.019
{\an4}EXCUSE ME? YOU'RE GOING ON A
FACT-FINDING TRIP AND YOU
DIDN'T INVITE ME.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.187
TWO SECS, WHILE I
FIX MY FACE.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.855
SO ARE WE GOING INTO TOWN?

12:52.938 --> 12:54.064
NO CAN DO BOO.

12:54.148 --> 12:57.902
{\an1}(Whispering) DO NOT GO
WITHOUT ME.

13:00.321 --> 13:05.451
{\an5}IF SARAH'S FRIGHTENED OF
ME, WAIT 'TIL SHE MEETS
AMBER. HA HA HA.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.167
MISS ROBINSON!

13:13.250 --> 13:15.461
MR WINKLER.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.817
{\an4}YOU SAID OLD, BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW YOU MEANT,
LIKE OLD OLD.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.904
SHE LOOKS GOOD FOR
HER AGE. I GUESS.

13:41.987 --> 13:42.863
I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW
HOW OLD SHE IS.

13:42.947 --> 13:49.036
{\an1}WELL, THAT'S NO EXCUSE
FOR THOSE HANDS.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.913
SEE. SHE LIKES IT.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.542
THIS IS MOISTURISER. IT'S
REALLY GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.501
AMBER!

13:55.584 --> 13:58.420
{\an1}IT'S OKAY, IT'LL MAKE
YOU LOOK YOUNGER.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.756
{\an1}WELL, NOT EXACTLY YOUNGER -
IT'S NOT MIRACLE CREAM, BUT...

14:00.839 --> 14:05.636
LET'S SAVE THE INFOMERCIAL
FOR LATER AMBER.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.512
SARAH.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.348
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

14:09.431 --> 14:11.642
THE ONE WITH THE POWER.

14:11.725 --> 14:12.434
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:12.518 --> 14:13.727
SSH!

14:13.811 --> 14:15.354
IT'S ME, NINA.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.982
HAVE YOU FOUND IT?

14:18.065 --> 14:22.278
NO. NOT YET, BUT WE FOUND
SOME CYLINDERS.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.822
AND WE HEARD A LITTLE GIRL.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.117
{\an1}(singing quietly) ROCK A BYE
BABY ON THE TREE TOP.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.369
{\an1}YES! THE LITTLE GIRL ON THE
RECORDINGS.

14:30.452 --> 14:33.622
IS THAT YOU SARAH?

14:33.706 --> 14:38.836
LOOK, SHE'S SLEEPING.

14:39.878 --> 14:43.632
THE LITTLE GIRL, SHE SAYS
SOMETHING ABOUT A MURDER.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.719
THE MAN WHO KILLS. HE
WANTS TO STAY FOREVER.

14:46.802 --> 14:50.764
{\an1}HE WANTS TO TIP THE
SCALES OF LIFE.

14:50.848 --> 14:55.311
WHO SARAH? DO YOU
KNOW WHO IT IS?

14:55.394 --> 14:59.523
SOMETIMES I SEE THEIR
FACES IN THE MIRROR,

14:59.607 --> 15:01.942
{\an1}BUT I KNOW THEY'RE
NOT THERE.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.485
THAT'S FROM THE
RECORDINGS.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.987
DUH.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.823
YOU REALLY ARE THE GIRL ON
THE RECORDINGS AREN'T YOU?

15:07.906 --> 15:10.367
AND YOUR NAME REALLY
IS SARAH.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.662
MY MUMMY'S DEAD.

15:13.746 --> 15:16.665
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM SARAH?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.335
WHO KILLED THEM?

15:21.670 --> 15:24.089
I THINK THAT IS ALL WE'RE
GOING TO GET FOR TODAY.

15:24.173 --> 15:27.843
LET'S GET GOING.

15:27.926 --> 15:33.015
{\an4}THIS IS DEFINITELY JOY'S.
BUT THAT MEANS VICTOR NEVER
SENT IT BACK TO HER.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.351
IT CERTAINLY LOOKS
THAT WAY.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.646
{\an1}NO WONDER SHE NEVER ANSWERED
ANY OF MY CALLS.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.106
{\an4}BUT THIS IS PROOF THOUGH
ISN'T IT? PROOF OF THE
CONSPIRACY.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.526
IT'S NOT DEFINITIVE. WE
NEED SOMETHING MORE.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.236
WHAT ABOUT THE PHOTO?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.112
WHAT ABOUT IT?

15:47.196 --> 15:49.114
I TOLD YOU. THEY REMOVED
HER FROM IT.

15:49.198 --> 15:51.950
LOOK. SHE WAS STANDING
RIGHT HERE NEXT TO ME.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.827
{\an5}WAIT. WHAT'S THAT?

15:52.034 --> 15:53.827
WHAT?

15:53.911 --> 15:55.371
THAT. THERE.

15:55.454 --> 16:00.042
{\an1}I DUNNO. IT LOOKS LIKE...
A HAND?

16:00.125 --> 16:02.211
JOY'S HAND.

16:02.294 --> 16:04.672
CURIOUSER AND CURIOUSER.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.965
FINALLY, SOMEONE BELIEVES ME.

16:07.049 --> 16:09.134
COME ON, LET'S GO. WE
NEED TO CONFRONT THEM.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.220
NO, NOT YET, I NEED TO
DIG A LITTLE FURTHER.

16:11.303 --> 16:17.685
BE PATIENT OKAY. I WILL GET TO
THE BOTTOM OF THIS, I PROMISE.

16:21.355 --> 16:25.109
{\an4}RIGHT, CREEPY LITTLE GIRL
SARAH SAYS "SOMETIMES I SEE
THEM IN THE MIRROR"?

16:25.192 --> 16:28.153
{\an1}CRAZY OLD LADY SARAH TOTALLY
JUST SAID THE SAME THING!

16:28.237 --> 16:30.572
COINCIDENCE?
I THINK NOT.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.200
{\an1}SHE'S DEFINITELY THE GIRL
ON THE RECORDINGS.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.785
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE MURDER?

16:34.868 --> 16:36.912
YEAH, WE KIND OF
LOST HER BY THEN.

16:36.995 --> 16:39.248
{\an1}SOMETHING ABOUT
"TIPPING THE SCALES".

16:39.331 --> 16:41.875
{\an1}OKAY. SO I'VE HAD A REALLY
IMPORTANT IDEA.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.837
{\an4}WE'RE THE ONLY THREE
STUDENTS AT CREEPY TOWERS
WHO KNOW ALL ABOUT THIS.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.755
{\an1}WE'RE A CLUB, GANG, POSSE.
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO CALL IT.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.383
I THINK WE SHOULD
MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

16:49.466 --> 16:50.300
SIBUNA!

16:50.384 --> 16:52.428
SIBUNA?

16:52.511 --> 16:55.180
{\an1}ANUBIS, BACKWARDS.
SEE WHAT I DID THERE?

16:55.264 --> 16:56.765
I'M A LITTLE
BIT OF A GENIUS.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.516
A LITTLE BIT...

16:57.599 --> 16:59.601
I KNOW! SO WHAT DO
YOU SAY?

16:59.685 --> 17:05.273
{\an4}OKAY. DOES THIS MEAN THAT WE
MAKE A SOLEMN OATH NOT TO
TELL ANYONE ABOUT THIS?

17:05.357 --> 17:06.775
ABSOLUTELY.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.527
OKAY. I'M IN.

17:08.609 --> 17:11.780
{\an4}BUT NO PRICKING OUR FINGERS
OR EATING SNAKES OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT.

17:11.864 --> 17:14.992
{\an5}(School bell rings)
AND TONIGHT, WE MAKE IT
OFFICIAL.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.118
HI, CRICKLEWOOD PHOTOGRAPHERS?

17:17.202 --> 17:21.205
YEAH HI, I'M CALLING ON
BEHALF OF MR ERIC SWEET.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.167
{\an1}I BELIEVE YOU DO ALL OUR
SCHOOL PHOTOS?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.387
ALFIE.

17:35.471 --> 17:40.142
{\an4}SHE WON'T KNOW WHY, BUT SHE'LL
SMELL LIKE CARP FOR A WEEK.

17:44.897 --> 17:47.775
WHAT IS SHE HIDING THIS FOR?

17:47.858 --> 17:49.109
SHE'S SNEAKIER THAN
SHE LOOKS.

17:49.193 --> 17:53.655
FISHY. GET IT. BECAUSE
IT'S A FISH. HA HA HA.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.741
I GET IT. HYSTERICAL.

17:55.824 --> 17:56.992
<i>(young Sarah) "HE'S</i>
<i>LOOKING FOR ANSWERS,</i>

17:57.076 --> 17:59.828
{\an1}<i>BUT HE'LL NEVER GET THEM</i>
<i>FROM ME. NEVER.</i>

17:59.912 --> 18:03.040
{\an4}<i>SOMETIMES HE SAYS THINGS IN</i>
<i>THE HOPE THAT I'LL REACT,</i>
<i>BUT I DON'T."</i>

18:03.123 --> 18:06.168
{\an1}WHAT KIND OF WEIRD AUDIO
BOOK IS THIS?

18:06.251 --> 18:07.211
TERRIBLE QUALITY.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.963
YEAH. WHY'S SHE LISTENING
TO THIS RUBBISH?

18:10.047 --> 18:12.132
{\an1}(In a girl's voice) I TOOKETH
MYSELF UP TO THE ATTIC

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
AND VERILY THERE WAS
ONE MASSIVE SURPRISE.

18:14.593 --> 18:19.056
THE LADY OF THE HOUSE, LOCKED
AWAY, WAS A TOTAL NUT JOB'ETH.

18:19.139 --> 18:23.811
VERILY I TURNETH ON
MY HEELS AND RAN AWAY.

18:23.894 --> 18:26.063
(They both laugh)

18:26.146 --> 18:29.566
(Computer ping)

18:43.163 --> 18:48.877
{\an4}OH ANCIENT GODS OF ANUBIS
HOUSE. WE PLEDGE OURSELVES TO
YOUR SECRETS AND YOUR QUEST.

18:48.961 --> 18:53.382
{\an4}WE ARE THE SIBUNA CLUB. AND
WE MAKE THESE SACRIFICES AS
A PLEDGE.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.718
WHOAH, WAIT, HANG ON. YOU
ARE NOT SACRIFICING MERL.

18:56.802 --> 19:00.556
{\an4}AND THIS IS MY SIGNED COPY
OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM IS YOUR
FRIEND!

19:00.639 --> 19:03.725
{\an1}OKAY, EVEN THOUGH THESE THINS
SEEM REALLY DUMB TO ME,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.644
I KNOW THEY MEAN
SOMETHING TO YOU.

19:05.727 --> 19:06.895
IT HAS TO BE A SACRIFICE.

19:06.979 --> 19:10.315
YEAH, BUT SUCH A BIG
SACRIFICE?

19:10.399 --> 19:16.280
LOOK, YOU CAN HAVE THIS,
BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE MERL.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.407
THIS GUY, HE'S MY
LUCKY MASCOT,

19:18.490 --> 19:24.997
{\an1}SO IT'S STILL A SACRIFICE. BUT
JUST NOT SUCH A BIG ONE.

19:37.050 --> 19:40.971
{\an1}I, NINA MARTIN, BEING OF
SOUND MIND.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.265
WELL, SEMI-SOUND MIND,

19:43.348 --> 19:46.894

SECRETS OF ANUBIS HOUSE

{\an1}AND STAND BY MY FELLOW

{\an4}AND STAND BY MY FELLOW CLUB

20:13.670 --> 20:20.344
{\an4}THESE ARE OUR SACRED VOWS.

THEM ASUNDER.

20:20.427 --> 20:23.305
{\an5}- SIBUNA!
- SIBUNA!

20:23.388 --> 20:25.432
(Thunder noise)

20:25.515 --> 20:27.809
{\an1}OOH, THAT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.
WE SHOULD GET GOING.

20:27.893 --> 20:31.313
AND OF COURSE, I'VE
JUST DONE MY HAIR.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.818
ANY LUCK?

20:36.902 --> 20:40.530
{\an1}NO. I'VE TRIED EVERY SINGLE
POSSIBLE COMBINATION.

20:40.989 --> 20:44.993
EXCEPT THAT ONE. OBVIOUSLY.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.663
WHAT'S IN IT?

20:50.290 --> 20:53.627
{\an1}(Reading) "WHEN DAYTIME
ENDS AT MIDDAY,

20:53.710 --> 20:58.173
{\an1}"THROUGH TEARS OF GLASS
THE EYE SHALL SEE."

20:58.256 --> 21:01.677
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
