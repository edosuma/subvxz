by lightning.

19:23.161 --> 19:26.290
Maybe I'll be safe in that log.

19:26.373 --> 19:28.292
But there could be
rabid beavers!

19:28.375 --> 19:30.085
Back to the picnic basket!

19:30.168 --> 19:32.504
No, wait!
The bears. Oh!

19:33.505 --> 19:34.047
- Ah, what a day!

19:34.131 --> 19:36.091
Grand Venture State Park,

19:36.174 --> 19:37.467
{\an1}you always know
how to show us a grand time.

19:37.551 --> 19:41.513
- This is great. I may actually
get out of here alive.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.723
{\an1}- Lincoln,
where are you going?

19:42.806 --> 19:44.141
{\an1}We got Lisa's
press conference.

19:44.224 --> 19:45.642
- You guys go without me.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.436
The flash from the cameras
could blind me.

19:47.519 --> 19:51.106
- Members of the press,
I have made a discovery

19:51.189 --> 19:52.900
{\an3}that will forever alter
our understanding

19:52.983 --> 19:55.193
of the animal kingdom.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.946
{\an3}I give you...
the dowl.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.948
{\an8}Or "Loudicus Lisa,"
if you prefer.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.783
{\an8}[excited chattering]
- [screams]

20:01.867 --> 20:06.163
{\an8}- As you can see,
the antlers of the dowl are...

20:06.246 --> 20:08.749
"Made in China"?

20:08.832 --> 20:11.835
- Excuse me, I just remembered,
I, uh, left the iron on

20:11.919 --> 20:14.129
in the ranger station.

20:14.212 --> 20:16.173
Forest fires are no joke.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.467
- Hold it right there, Bub.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.551
What gives?

20:19.635 --> 20:21.345
- [sighs] Okay.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.721
I concocted the whole thing.

20:22.804 --> 20:24.640
{\an1}I bought the antlers
at a yard sale,

20:24.723 --> 20:26.058
and glued them on the owl.

20:26.141 --> 20:28.393
{\an8}You think science
is some sort of a joke?

20:28.477 --> 20:31.813
{\an7}- No, it's just that ever since
the geyser stopped erupting,

20:31.897 --> 20:33.649
{\an7}no one comes
to the park anymore.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.985
{\an7}I thought a little publicity
would bring people back.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.154
{\an8}<i>[microphone feedback]</i>

20:39.237 --> 20:40.906
{\an8}My apologies to you all.

20:40.989 --> 20:43.075
{\an8}Obviously, the dowl is a fake.

20:43.158 --> 20:44.576
{\an8}- A fake?
[gasps]

20:44.660 --> 20:47.204
{\an8}So Lucy's prediction
for you wasn't true.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.997
{\an8}- That is a logical conclusion.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.416
{\an8}- Which means mine
wasn't true either.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.502
{\an8}- Second logical conclusion.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.129
{\an8}- I ruined my whole day
for no reason.

20:56.213 --> 20:58.840
- Thrice, a logical conclusion.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.259
- Okay, kids, you have
five minutes to get in the car.

21:00.342 --> 21:04.805
And if you miss the cut-off,
no guarantees.

21:04.888 --> 21:06.974
- Well, I guess there's
a lesson here.

21:07.057 --> 21:07.891
You can't live
your life in fear,

21:07.975 --> 21:10.269
or you'll miss out on it.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.021
And that would be a tragedy.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.610
It's the geyser!
Whoa!

21:20.362 --> 21:22.114
<i>[horn honking]</i>

21:22.906 --> 21:25.033
He really is
leaving me behind.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.494
Sheesh! I always thought
that was an empty threat.

21:27.577 --> 21:28.537
Guys, wait!

21:28.620 --> 21:32.416
Guys, guys! You won't
believe what happened!

21:32.499 --> 21:34.209
{\an8}I just saw the geyser go off!

21:34.292 --> 21:37.879
{\an8}- Ugh. Lincoln, you told me
Pop Pop wasn't gonna be here.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.549
{\an9}- Leni, it's not--
Never mind.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.801
{\an3}This turned out to be
the best day ever.

21:42.884 --> 21:46.805
- Well, Lucy, I guess you'll be
throwing out those silly cards

21:46.888 --> 21:49.057
{\an3}now that you've been
completely discredited.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.393
{\an1}- Wrong. I can prove
fortune telling is real

21:51.476 --> 21:53.020
with one last prediction.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.439
The end is near.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.149
- Oh, please, give me a--
