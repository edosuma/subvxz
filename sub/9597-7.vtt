00:32.716 --> 00:33.844
Rod!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.920
Eve?
No!

00:56.339 --> 00:59.266
Jane, stop playing with
the doughnuts and help.

00:59.300 --> 01:01.496
I'm not playing.
This is playing.

01:02.694 --> 01:04.723
I still don't get why you
agreed to host this thing...

01:04.757 --> 01:06.786
and why they don't
bring their own clothes.

01:06.852 --> 01:09.181
Well, the convention
center doubled their rate

01:09.216 --> 01:11.393
after last year's... issue.

01:11.427 --> 01:12.522
What issue?

01:13.821 --> 01:16.552
She left a severed head in the hotel fridge.

01:19.316 --> 01:21.547
Dominick, delivering the bread again.

01:21.581 --> 01:25.609
I can't find a new delivery guy.
Oh. I don't mind.

01:25.643 --> 01:26.773
It's nice to get out from
behind the counter.

01:26.807 --> 01:28.373
Jane, you remember Dominick.

01:30.573 --> 01:33.703
- Yes! How are you?
- Good.

01:33.736 --> 01:35.235
- It's nice to see you, Jane.
- Good to see you.

01:35.303 --> 01:38.133
You, um, you used to
love fresh ciabatta rolls.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.265
Oh, yeah! Yeah!
Bianchi's bakery!

01:41.299 --> 01:43.996
Oh, I haven't been there in years.
Maura, you got to try one of these.

01:44.031 --> 01:46.496
White flour only uses the endosperm.

01:48.229 --> 01:50.260
It's awful to eat with you.

01:50.295 --> 01:51.527
Dominick, whenever you get backed up,

01:51.561 --> 01:53.526
I'm more than willing to swing by

01:53.560 --> 01:57.124
and pick up my order...
in my new car.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.989
What? Since when?

01:59.024 --> 02:03.655
Since I became "can'o espress'o's
sales person of the month".

02:03.689 --> 02:06.388
A crappy canned coffee gave you a car?

02:06.422 --> 02:11.319
A Camry.
She's beautiful. Wait till you see her.

02:11.354 --> 02:13.285
Is he with the band?

02:14.386 --> 02:16.350
Hello, Dr. Pike.
It's nice to see you.

02:16.385 --> 02:18.351
Detective Rizzoli, you look stunning.

02:18.385 --> 02:20.651
Hmm. Stunning?
Thank you.

02:20.684 --> 02:23.451
Oh, hello, Dr. Isles.

02:23.485 --> 02:26.317
Hello, Dr. Pike.
You brought quite a few things.

02:26.352 --> 02:28.983
Well, when you're a
cutting-edge forensic scientist,

02:29.018 --> 02:30.649
you have an obligation
to share that knowledge

02:30.684 --> 02:33.083
with your less-skilled colleagues.

02:33.117 --> 02:35.750
Oh. The colleagues that
can't tell the difference

02:35.784 --> 02:38.117
between a .38- and
a .45-caliber bullet?

02:38.151 --> 02:41.551
Oh, look! More cutting-edge
forensic scientists.

02:42.519 --> 02:45.651
Hello. I am delighted to welcome you all

02:45.685 --> 02:49.218
to the "Annual bullet and
blast injuries symposium".

02:49.286 --> 02:50.486
Well, this is real nice of you, Dr. Isles.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.319
- Dr. Billy Ray Higgins.
- Of course. Nice to see you again.

02:53.353 --> 02:55.286
I look forward to your
powerpoint presentation

02:55.320 --> 02:57.452
on the pathophysiology
of blast injuries.

02:57.487 --> 02:59.252
Hey, girl! Um...

02:59.287 --> 03:01.586
Me? He called me a girl?

03:01.620 --> 03:05.652
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, take this. Goes in the freezer.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.320
When I need, you bring.

03:11.088 --> 03:13.321
- Oh, not again!
- What?

03:13.355 --> 03:15.121
I-I don't know.

03:15.155 --> 03:16.755
I guess my phone number is close
to some guy's wife's number.

03:16.789 --> 03:20.990
I keep getting all these weird texts,
like, "hon, pick up my dry cleaning.

03:21.024 --> 03:23.057
"Hon, I think we're out of milk."

03:23.091 --> 03:25.291
Dr. Isles, I specifically
requested a special meal...

03:25.325 --> 03:27.125
steel-cut oats with
dried-fruit topping.

03:29.726 --> 03:31.125
- This better be a murder.
- Mm.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.526
- It is! Come on.
- Excuse me!

03:33.561 --> 03:36.726
Have a doughnut. No endosperm.

03:51.668 --> 03:54.727

03:55.596 --> 03:58.472
<b>3x07 - Crazy for You</b>

04:06.663 --> 04:07.696
Hey.

04:07.730 --> 04:11.364
- Double homicide.
- Looks like a .38.

04:11.399 --> 04:12.054
Who are the victims?

04:12.055 --> 04:13.365
Husband and wife shrinks.
No sign of forced entry.

04:13.399 --> 04:16.168
No surveillance cameras
inside or outside the building.

04:16.202 --> 04:19.140
That's bad. What, you think
we're looking for a patient?

04:19.175 --> 04:20.673
Maybe. Frost is talking
to the office manager.

04:20.709 --> 04:24.541
W...
Dr. Eve Parker?

04:24.575 --> 04:26.010
What, the Dr. Eve?

04:26.044 --> 04:28.014
Media's gonna have a
field day with this.

04:28.048 --> 04:29.149
Why? Who's she?

04:29.183 --> 04:32.686
- Someone who hated children.
- Jane, that's not true.

04:32.720 --> 04:35.222
Really? She wrote
"no womb for children."

04:36.591 --> 04:38.491
She advocates childless marriages.

04:38.761 --> 04:41.395
Ma used to listen to her radio program
when she was mad at us.

04:43.132 --> 04:45.566
Well, I am only familiar with the
work of her husband, Dr. Rod Parker.

04:45.601 --> 04:46.768
Yeah, did he hate kids, too?

04:48.203 --> 04:50.405
He was an expert in
delusional disorders.

04:50.439 --> 04:54.276
Mm. Soot on the clothing.
Stippling on the skin.

04:54.310 --> 04:56.178
Yeah, his was a close-contact
through-and-through.

04:56.212 --> 04:58.080
Hers was from maybe three feet away.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.115
Look at the way the
bodies are positioned.

05:00.183 --> 05:02.184
She's on her way out to the bathroom,

05:02.218 --> 05:06.054
which suggests our
shooter was lying in wait.

05:06.089 --> 05:08.729
Maybe the husband was talking to
the shooter, and she surprises them?

05:08.763 --> 05:15.270
Maybe. Or she comes out first,
he hears the gun go off, runs out.

05:15.304 --> 05:17.338
What...
what we need to know is,

05:17.373 --> 05:19.607
were they both targets
or just one of them?

05:19.641 --> 05:22.409
Office manager found the bodies
when she came in at 7:00 a.m.

05:22.444 --> 05:25.411
- Did you get a patient list from her?
- No. I got a search warrant going.

05:25.445 --> 05:27.779
She gave me yesterday's
patient sign-in sheet, though.

05:27.813 --> 05:31.650
Okay, so, Dr. Eve's last patient
was at 5:00, Dr. Rod's at 6:00.

05:31.684 --> 05:33.351
What, patients only sign
in with their initials?

05:33.385 --> 05:36.788
- It's a privacy issue.
- Well, thank you, doctor.

05:36.822 --> 05:39.624
I had no idea grandly
deluded people wanted privacy.

05:41.660 --> 05:44.128
Hey, Maura, you got your tweezers?

05:44.163 --> 05:48.232
Look. It's a piece of latex
from the shooter's glove.

05:48.266 --> 05:54.171
Latex has many uses ...
balloons, pencil erasers, spandex.

05:54.239 --> 05:56.974
Okay, I'm going to
guess that the shooter

05:56.975 --> 05:59.710
wasn't wearing spandex
or carrying balloons.

06:01.680 --> 06:05.582
I hope it's enough to
recover a partial print.

06:07.686 --> 06:11.388
A single bullet penetrated
the left ventricle.

06:11.423 --> 06:15.126
That size hole says it's
in the .38-caliber family.

06:15.160 --> 06:17.295
Oh, bullets have families
in Texas, do they?

06:17.329 --> 06:21.765
It was obviously a .45.
Female victim also died from a .45.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.468
I'm thinking
we got a different horse galloping here.

06:24.502 --> 06:27.237
Oh, really?
A morab? A mustang?

06:27.272 --> 06:29.740
Well, you're saying the bullet that
made that hole is a draft horse,

06:29.775 --> 06:31.275
and I'm saying it's more
like a Shetland pony.

06:31.310 --> 06:35.547
- This is waste of time.
- I'm sorry?

06:35.581 --> 06:39.382
It's classic murder-suicide.

06:39.450 --> 06:43.252
But both victims died instantly,
and the gun wasn't recovered.

06:43.287 --> 06:45.388
It's so obvious.
Kindergartner would know.

06:45.422 --> 06:51.526
Husband shoots wife,
then shoots his chest,

06:51.560 --> 06:54.797
just has enough time to toss
the gun out in the window.

06:54.831 --> 06:58.233
It's like chicken whose head cut off.

06:58.602 --> 07:02.371
Dr. Popov, human beings don't move
once the cerebral cortex has been s...

07:02.406 --> 07:04.207
I think you're wasting your breath.

07:04.241 --> 07:06.509
This guy don't know his butt
from a hole in the ground.

07:06.544 --> 07:09.196
I'd like to take
this opportunity to unveil

07:09.197 --> 07:11.848
the most significant new
development in the forensic world.

07:11.882 --> 07:13.917
The particle-vac!

07:13.984 --> 07:15.919
Dr. Pike, please turn that thing off.

07:15.953 --> 07:19.722
Capable of fully adjustable suction
up to 50 kilopascals.

07:19.756 --> 07:22.424
- Step aside, please.
- Please turn that off!

07:22.459 --> 07:25.794
We are here to advance each
other's knowledge of gunshot wounds!

07:25.829 --> 07:27.663
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa! Ow!

07:27.697 --> 07:29.732
Whoa!
Now look what you've done!

07:29.766 --> 07:32.201
I'm gonna have to bill you for that.

07:32.235 --> 07:36.506
Hey. Crime lab is working
on that piece of latex.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.208
Maybe we'll get lucky,
get a partial print.

07:38.242 --> 07:41.978
Dr. Eve had a huge web presence.
She just released her newest book.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.748
"No need to breed."

07:44.782 --> 07:46.685
Here she is promoting the book.

07:46.719 --> 07:50.593
<i>You can choose not to be a mother.
You do not have to breed.</i>

07:50.627 --> 07:53.996
Judge Allen denied our request
for patient files and phone records.

07:54.030 --> 07:55.564
He won't even allow us
to get a list of names.

07:55.598 --> 07:58.600
- Now what are we gonna do?
- We'll go see Allen in his chambers.

07:58.635 --> 08:00.302
Mm. Okay.

08:00.336 --> 08:01.970
But Dr. Eve had a book signing
at the literate mind bookstore

08:02.004 --> 08:03.905
a few hours before she was murdered.

08:03.940 --> 08:05.640
- That's interesting.
- So is this.

08:05.675 --> 08:09.244
Dr. Eve had a lot of haters. Here's
a blogger with a big following ...

08:09.279 --> 08:12.514
Valerie Miller. "Waak"...
"wives are about kids."

08:12.549 --> 08:15.250
Looks like she's aiming
a rifle at our victim.

08:15.284 --> 08:17.886
"This fiend hates your child"?
This from a mother of nine?

08:17.920 --> 08:19.888
She's sure plugged in to social media

08:19.923 --> 08:21.657
for someone who
homeschools all those kids.

08:21.693 --> 08:23.895
- Check out her timeline.
- Translation, please?

08:23.929 --> 08:25.696
Oh, she leads such a fascinating life,

08:25.731 --> 08:27.832
she wants everyone to know
what she's doing at all times.

08:27.866 --> 08:29.500
Where was "Mrs. Waak" yesterday?

08:29.535 --> 08:32.804
The "Literate mind" bookstore,
where Dr. Eve had the book signing.

08:33.806 --> 08:34.972
Where was she last night?

08:35.006 --> 08:36.575
Don't know.
She stopped checking in.

08:36.609 --> 08:38.543
Well, I don't think
"Mrs. Waak" was getting

08:38.578 --> 08:40.379
a signed copy of "no need to breed."

08:48.842 --> 08:52.731
- Don't you feel a little funny driving this?
- Why would I feel funny? 

08:52.765 --> 08:55.734
It's the nicest car I ever had.
Come on.

08:55.768 --> 08:59.104
Let's get these groceries inside,
and I'll take you for a spin.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.773
Oh, I-I can't right now.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.875
- Oh.
- They just gave it to you?

09:03.910 --> 09:06.244
I have to do a little promotion.

09:10.015 --> 09:11.949
It's voice-activated.

09:11.983 --> 09:15.085
<i>Can'o espress'o added the loudspeaker.</i>

09:15.120 --> 09:16.420
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

09:16.454 --> 09:17.521
Uh, yeah, Ma.

09:17.555 --> 09:22.192
<i>Come see! It has voice-activated
bing search capabilities.</i>

09:22.227 --> 09:23.894
Cool!

09:23.929 --> 09:26.998
<i>Frankie, you look so
handsome in your uniform.</i>

09:27.066 --> 09:28.266
Oh, my god. Ma, stop!

09:28.300 --> 09:29.501
<i>Why?
Am I embarrassing you ... </i>

09:31.204 --> 09:33.972
<i>Oh, my god!
Somebody hit my car!</i>

09:35.474 --> 09:39.144
<i>My brand-new car!
What the...</i>

09:39.178 --> 09:42.280
Well, I didn't hit it very hard, did I?

09:42.314 --> 09:44.082
Oh, yeah, good.
It's just a little dent.

09:44.116 --> 09:45.450
<i>A little dent?
It's a brand-new car!</i>

09:45.484 --> 09:47.285
Ma, take the headset off.

09:47.319 --> 09:49.821
Uh, I-I...
Shoot! I'm sorry.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.289
- I'll get it fixed.
- Oh, you bet you will!

09:51.323 --> 09:53.325
Don't you look where you're driving?!

09:53.359 --> 09:54.926
Can I just give you cash?

09:54.960 --> 09:59.466
I mean, is, um, $30 enough?

09:59.500 --> 10:02.338
Are you kidding me?!
Frankie, tell me she's kidding me.

10:02.372 --> 10:04.039
Uh...Hey. Oh.

10:05.309 --> 10:06.543
Let ... let me help you with that.

10:08.180 --> 10:10.181
- Ma!
- What?

10:10.215 --> 10:14.051
- Come on.
- Oh.

10:14.119 --> 10:16.354
- Um... how pregnant are you?
- Seven months.

10:16.388 --> 10:18.489
All right, all right. Don't cry.
We... we'll call
your husband.

10:18.523 --> 10:23.227
- Fiancé ... ex.
- Oh.

10:23.261 --> 10:26.129
- He dumped me.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

10:29.134 --> 10:31.470
Uh, here.
That's a lot of unpaid parking tickets.

10:31.504 --> 10:34.509
Thank you.
That's why I'm here.

10:34.543 --> 10:38.947
You're gonna boot my car
if I don't sign up for a payment plan.

10:38.982 --> 10:42.551
- There isn't really a payment plan.
- Then what am I gonna do?

10:42.585 --> 10:45.487
I lost my job. My
roommate kicked me out.

10:45.522 --> 10:46.989
I live in my car.

10:47.023 --> 10:50.025
- Lydia?
- Yeah.

10:53.663 --> 10:56.998
Oh, my god. You're sure?
Lydia "Lydia"?

10:57.033 --> 10:59.090
- Dad's fiancé, Lydia?
- Yeah.

10:59.193 --> 11:02.572
Yeah, I saw her name on the
parking notices ... Lydia Sparks.

11:02.606 --> 11:05.074
- And you're sure she's pregnant?
- She's out to here.

11:07.178 --> 11:09.912
- Well, what do we do?!
- How the hell should I know?

11:09.947 --> 11:12.782
- Well, should we call pop?
- No, she says he dumped her.

11:12.816 --> 11:18.754
Do we just not know him, or is he having
some deranged, late midlife crisis?

11:18.789 --> 11:21.057
Janie, she's living out of her car.

11:21.091 --> 11:28.932
- What if that's our...?
- Our brother or sister? Oh, my god.

11:32.203 --> 11:36.006
Uh, isn't there someone the
children can stay with while we talk?

11:36.040 --> 11:38.812
- Maybe an older sibling?
- My children are very well-behaved.

11:38.847 --> 11:41.113
Yeah.

11:41.816 --> 11:45.486
Take a look at that.
You didn't like Dr. Eve much, did you?

11:45.520 --> 11:48.155
- Not even a little bit.
- That's a pretty violent image.

11:48.189 --> 11:50.090
I thought it made my point
in a very visceral way.

11:50.125 --> 11:53.026
So did shooting her.
That made your point, too.

11:53.060 --> 11:54.895
She's a despicable person.

11:54.929 --> 11:58.899
I don't even want to share gender
by calling her a woman.

11:58.934 --> 12:01.101
But I wouldn't stoop to killing her.

12:01.136 --> 12:06.540
Hey! Finger out of your nose.
Do you have children, Detective?

12:06.574 --> 12:08.542
- I do not.
- It figures.

12:08.576 --> 12:11.144
- How does it figure?
- Your waist.

12:11.178 --> 12:13.512
Even you would have trouble finding

12:13.547 --> 12:15.448
a flattering bathing
suit after nine children.

12:15.482 --> 12:17.216
Luckily, that's the only downside.

12:17.251 --> 12:19.752
Is that why you shot Dr. Eve?
She didn't have stretch marks?

12:19.787 --> 12:21.521
Oh, I'm very proud of my womb.

12:21.555 --> 12:24.356
Oh, please don't show me
your womb, Mrs. Miller.

12:24.759 --> 12:27.227
Okay, where were you last night?

12:27.261 --> 12:31.197
With my children...
and 20 other mothers and their children

12:31.231 --> 12:33.800
at my "wives are about kids" meeting.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.703
It's already on youtube.
Would you like to see?

12:38.705 --> 12:40.840
What makes you think
that coming here in person

12:40.874 --> 12:42.776
will make me change my mind, Detectives?

12:42.810 --> 12:44.678
We need that patient list, your honor.

12:44.712 --> 12:47.948
There is nothing
in your affidavit to support

12:47.949 --> 12:51.184
your assumption that evidence
of a crime will be discovered

12:51.219 --> 12:53.954
if I allow you to trample
the rights of these patients.

12:53.989 --> 12:55.489
All due respect, your honor ...

12:55.524 --> 12:58.960
both doctors were killed in their
offices, where they see their patients.

12:58.994 --> 12:59.994
I'm not convinced.

13:01.196 --> 13:04.031
Absent a stronger link
between your crime and these patients,

13:04.065 --> 13:07.702
this is merely a fishing expedition.
Have a good day.

13:07.736 --> 13:10.639
- Judge Allen, this is important.
- So's the law, Detective.

13:10.673 --> 13:12.207
We understand, your honor,
but without those names ...

13:12.242 --> 13:14.710
If you ever want me to sign
another warrant for you again,

13:14.744 --> 13:18.013
I suggest you leave my chambers.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.091
Hey. Where are all your
little "Dr. Death" friends?

13:30.159 --> 13:35.197
Enjoying a lecture on using silicone
scalps for terminal ballistics testing.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.165
Mm, and you're missing it?

13:37.200 --> 13:40.302
I know! 'Cause I needed
to get away from Dr. Pike.

13:40.336 --> 13:42.771
- I think Pike is on the take.
- What?

13:42.805 --> 13:44.940
He is using his position to privateer.

13:44.974 --> 13:48.544
He's... attacking foreign
ships during wartime?

13:50.180 --> 13:53.216
I think he is taking kickbacks
to hawk a forensic vacuum.

13:53.251 --> 13:55.018
Maura, this is very serious.

13:55.052 --> 13:57.921
- It is?
-  No! You haven't started the autopsy yet?

13:57.955 --> 14:01.558
Pike is handing out hats
and pens and travel mugs.

14:01.592 --> 14:05.328
- That is swag, Detective.
- I'll get our swag unit on it.

14:05.362 --> 14:07.564
I need to know how to entrap him.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.601
Okay!
Take it easy, serpico.

14:10.635 --> 14:14.137
Can we please solve our
double homicide first?

14:14.205 --> 14:17.808
Okay. Help me undress her.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.843
Think you can be childless
and have a fulfilling marriage?

14:19.878 --> 14:23.181
No. With or without children,
marriage is miserable.

14:23.215 --> 14:26.317
Oh, not so. Studies show
that parents' happiness has

14:26.352 --> 14:30.855
remained steady since 1972, while
non-parents' happiness has dropped.

14:30.889 --> 14:34.125
Did I tell you I'm starting
a new organization called "S.A.W."?

14:34.159 --> 14:38.896
- That's a hostile acronym.
- It stands for "stuck at work."

14:38.930 --> 14:41.132
And I'm gonna be stuck here
longer if you don't get on it.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.100
Okay.

14:46.005 --> 14:47.372
It's a shell casing.

14:47.406 --> 14:50.041
Where's the bullet that
went through Dr. Rod?

14:54.780 --> 14:57.748
Which means she was shot first,
then he was shot,

14:57.783 --> 15:00.852
and the casing flew off into her sleeve.

15:00.886 --> 15:03.955
Damn. No prints.
Wait.

15:03.989 --> 15:06.758
Thanks. Here.

15:07.926 --> 15:12.163
Vome on.
Not again with this weird husband guy.

15:12.198 --> 15:16.134
Look. "hon, don't forget your
brazilian-wax appointment."

15:16.168 --> 15:18.737
What ... I mean,
how many times I got to tell this guy?

15:18.771 --> 15:23.742
"I'm not your wife." Oh, forgot to
tell you, Frankie met Lydia today.

15:30.717 --> 15:33.018
You're looking very, very guilty.
What are you not telling me?

15:36.689 --> 15:38.990
I promised Tommy that I-I wouldn't say.

15:39.024 --> 15:43.962
Huh.
This looks very sharp.

15:46.432 --> 15:49.401
Okay.

15:49.435 --> 15:52.404
Okay.
But don't get mad.

15:53.706 --> 15:56.174
<i>What?!!
Tommy slept with Lydia?!</i>

16:02.274 --> 16:05.643
I thought there wasn't any surveillance
footage of the victims' offices? 

16:05.678 --> 16:07.545
There isn't, but I found
a private security camera

16:07.579 --> 16:09.079
aimed at the building next to theirs.

16:09.114 --> 16:11.616
Thought I'd see if maybe
the killer walked by.

16:11.650 --> 16:13.752
And how would you know
if it was the killer?

16:13.786 --> 16:17.322
Probably wouldn't.
But I did find this.

16:18.592 --> 16:23.095
Smart, Frost. What ... that's a city
car collecting footage of Boston.

16:23.129 --> 16:25.898
Yeah. And it drove by the Parkers'
building at 5:56 p.m. yesterday.

16:25.932 --> 16:27.600
What?

16:27.634 --> 16:31.203
That's right before E.A. had
an appointment with Dr. Rod.

16:31.238 --> 16:32.638
Check this out.

16:35.275 --> 16:37.577
She's headed right
toward their building.

16:37.611 --> 16:40.580
You think we have enough landmarks
for facial recognition?

16:40.615 --> 16:42.048
Won't know till we try.

16:51.393 --> 16:53.695
Okay, she's pretty close.

16:55.698 --> 16:56.932
Frost, the man is closer.

16:56.966 --> 17:02.203
Oh, my god.
E.A. is Eugene Allen.

17:02.237 --> 17:04.739
Judge Eugene Allen?

17:04.772 --> 17:06.840
No wonder he wouldn't sign the warrants.

17:06.875 --> 17:10.744
Yeah, because he's a patient.
Well, maybe he's a killer, too.

17:10.779 --> 17:12.079
You want me to go with you?

17:12.114 --> 17:14.082
No. No, this one
belongs to me and Korsak.

17:14.116 --> 17:16.184
Go get him.

17:18.188 --> 17:20.756
You can't go into his chambers.
You can't go in there.

17:22.025 --> 17:25.295
How dare you enter my chambers?
Why wasn't that door locked?

17:25.329 --> 17:26.863
You're asking us?

17:26.896 --> 17:28.131
Well, stop staring
and shut the damn door.

17:35.806 --> 17:40.343
I believe I told you not to return
until you had a stronger link

17:40.377 --> 17:43.046
between your crime and
Dr. Parker's patients.

17:44.215 --> 17:45.915
That strong enough?

17:46.918 --> 17:49.153
Did you kill him because
he knew your secret?

17:50.187 --> 17:52.725
Dr. Parker helped me.

17:56.029 --> 18:00.800
I'm finally enjoying my life,
my work...

18:02.369 --> 18:06.339
...because he encouraged
me to be myself.

18:06.374 --> 18:12.313
Behind closed doors,
I am Eugenia Allen.

18:12.347 --> 18:17.017
Okay, Eugenia.
Sign these warrants

18:17.052 --> 18:19.720
for Dr. Eve and Dr. Rod's
phone and patient records.

18:21.723 --> 18:23.491
You think you can blackmail me?

18:25.194 --> 18:27.161
You think you can block
a homicide investigation

18:27.196 --> 18:28.997
to keep your personal life quiet?

18:32.501 --> 18:36.305
Need a pen...
uh, ma'am?

18:38.408 --> 18:39.441
Thank you.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.151
<i>You have no idea how fun
medical examiners' parties can be.</i>

18:48.186 --> 18:49.920
<i>Talk about the case
... you'll fit right in.</i>

18:49.954 --> 18:51.188
Oka...

18:51.222 --> 18:54.225
Okay, so we got the patient lists.
It's like over 200 people.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.194
Well, I'll take a look at
the doctors' sessions notes.

18:56.228 --> 18:57.962
Maybe I can eliminate
the nonviolent patients.

18:58.030 --> 19:02.100
Okay. I mean, I think that
Dr. Rod was the target.

19:02.134 --> 19:04.268
I think Dr. Eve just picked the
wrong time to go to the bathroom.

19:04.303 --> 19:05.303
Oh.

19:05.337 --> 19:07.772
For you, Detective Rizzoli.
And since you're so good

19:07.806 --> 19:13.945
- at stabbing people in the back...
- I haven't reported you to the BBVB...

19:14.914 --> 19:17.883
...yet.

19:17.918 --> 19:22.154
- Bullet and blast violation board.
- Oh, my.

19:22.222 --> 19:23.789
- Jane!
- Hmm?

19:23.823 --> 19:24.790
Swag!

19:27.294 --> 19:28.828
Attention, all swag units.

19:28.896 --> 19:32.131
We have swag distribution in
progress at the Dirty Robber.

19:32.166 --> 19:33.800
This is very serious.

19:33.834 --> 19:35.135
You could lose your
bullet and blast certification.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.838
- Not again!
- What, another murder?

19:38.906 --> 19:42.074
Another weird "hon" message.
"Hon, waiting up for you."

19:42.109 --> 19:45.445
Guess I should hurry home
since I've had my Brazilian.

19:45.479 --> 19:50.250
- I think you should tell your mother.
- Where I wax is my business.

19:50.284 --> 19:53.186
Lydia's baby might be her grandchild.

19:53.221 --> 19:57.357
That baby might also be her
ex-husband's bimbo's kid.

19:57.392 --> 20:00.494
It's a good thing Tommy's fishing
in the gulf. I want to kill him.

20:00.528 --> 20:04.229
Maybe that's why your father
called off the engagement.

20:05.232 --> 20:09.936
Because Lydia told him that
it might be Tommy's baby?

20:09.971 --> 20:11.138
No, no, no, no.

20:11.172 --> 20:12.939
No, no, no.
This can't be happening.

20:12.974 --> 20:14.174
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Are you calling your father?

20:14.208 --> 20:15.976
No, I'm gonna call Frankie.

20:16.010 --> 20:19.110
Well, you can't tell him he
might be an uncle over the phone.

20:20.114 --> 20:23.049
But...

20:32.122 --> 20:35.524
Oh, it's so nice to let my hair down

20:35.559 --> 20:38.027
and enjoy a few
Long Island iced teas.

20:38.061 --> 20:41.897
- How many have you had, Dr. Pike?
- Not more than four.

20:41.932 --> 20:45.067
- Or is it five?
- Well, perhaps that's enough.

20:45.135 --> 20:47.569
You look stunning tonight, Dr. Isles.

20:48.304 --> 20:51.473
- Excuse me?
- You're like a wildcat, aren't you?

20:51.508 --> 20:55.077
Lapping up that liquid with
your delicate pink tongue.

20:55.111 --> 20:56.578
- Please, stop.
- I've been in love with you, okay?

20:56.612 --> 20:59.180
Since the outdoor
remains recovery course.

20:59.215 --> 21:02.117
- What?!
- But I've been desperately afraid.

21:02.151 --> 21:06.222
I lost everything with my quest to
develop the perfect forensic vacuum.

21:06.256 --> 21:09.058
I invested
everything in particle-vac, Maura.

21:09.092 --> 21:12.395
- Everything!
- Okay. Stop. Stop.

21:12.429 --> 21:15.031
- Hey.
- What?

21:15.065 --> 21:18.868
- Lady says go away, Pike.
- Buzz off, Popov.

21:18.902 --> 21:23.239
You have as much chance
with woman as dead Dr. Parker.

21:23.274 --> 21:26.442
No. The corpse has better chance.

21:26.510 --> 21:28.978
Come on.
You want a piece of me?

21:29.013 --> 21:30.446
- Let's go.
- Okay!

21:30.514 --> 21:32.014
Here, let me help you.

21:32.049 --> 21:35.084
- Put up ducks.
- These are "dukes," you moron.

21:35.118 --> 21:36.251
- Oh, yeah?
- Uh ...

21:36.286 --> 21:37.620
What the hell?!

21:37.688 --> 21:39.021
You call me moron, huh?

21:40.190 --> 21:43.893
- Pike declared his love for me.
- What?!

21:43.928 --> 21:47.096
Hey! Hey! You two are
drunker than old cooter brown!

21:47.131 --> 21:48.598
Hey! Hey!

21:48.632 --> 21:50.266
If you don't quit, I'm
gonna whip you both so hard,

21:50.301 --> 21:51.400
you won't be able to
sit down for a week!

21:53.470 --> 21:55.904
- Thank you.
- Sorry about that.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.040
How's your, uh, case going?

21:58.074 --> 21:59.975
You know, we don't have
much forensic evidence.

22:00.009 --> 22:01.643
I found a shell casing,
but there's no prints.

22:01.711 --> 22:05.146
I've been working on this new
technique I studied over in England

22:05.181 --> 22:07.048
where sweat can sometimes
corrode the brass casing.

22:07.083 --> 22:10.184
What, so you think
you might be able to pull up a print?

22:10.219 --> 22:11.986
I might. I can look
at it for you tomorrow.

22:12.021 --> 22:15.256
Yeah. Yeah, that'd be great.
Thank you very much.

22:16.458 --> 22:18.659
All right, party's over. Let's go.

22:18.694 --> 22:23.431
- And you're telling Frankie.
- I'm telling Frankie what?

22:27.970 --> 22:29.605
What do you want to tell me?

22:29.639 --> 22:32.474
- Maura knows about Lydia.
- That's what you wanted to tell me?

22:32.508 --> 22:35.477
No. 
Uh, okay.

22:35.511 --> 22:38.413
It's about Tommy.
And he, uh ...

22:38.447 --> 22:41.316
- I can't believe I can't say this.
- He slept with Lydia.

22:41.351 --> 22:43.085
- He what?!
- Maura!

22:43.119 --> 22:45.654
- Lydia?
- Lydia?

22:45.689 --> 22:48.590
Oh, my god, Maura,
she needs your help.

22:48.625 --> 22:51.060
Ohh, I don't feel so good.

22:51.094 --> 22:54.329
This is Lydia Sparks.
She ran into my new car.

22:54.364 --> 22:55.564
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

22:55.598 --> 22:57.633
Can you tell the doctor what's wrong?

22:57.667 --> 23:00.636
Yeah, she's pregnant with your
first grandchild, and she's drunk.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.204
- Oh, god.
- Come on.

23:02.272 --> 23:04.007
Uh, uh, let's get her on the couch.

23:04.041 --> 23:05.608
Okay, easy. I got it, Ma.
I got it. I got it.

23:05.643 --> 23:07.235
- Here we go. Here we go. All right.
- Take it easy, Frankie.

23:07.337 --> 23:09.345
Okay. Easy, easy, easy, easy.
Okay.

23:09.380 --> 23:12.415
- I like couches.
- Yeah, well.

23:12.450 --> 23:15.518
Oh, you're really cute.

23:15.553 --> 23:22.526
Uh, Ma, why would you bring a drunk,
pregnant stranger into Maura's house?

23:22.561 --> 23:25.462
She came to the café to apologize.
She felt bad.

23:25.497 --> 23:27.765
So, you cheered her up with malt liquor?

23:27.799 --> 23:31.101
We had dinner ...
pasta, salad, some water.

23:32.170 --> 23:33.203
Oh. I have to pee.

23:33.238 --> 23:34.638
Again? Sh-she just went.

23:35.741 --> 23:39.477
- Lydia, are you thirsty?
- Uh-huh. I'm really thirsty.

23:39.511 --> 23:42.112
- Okay, Frankie, call an ambulance.
- What? I need E.M.S...

23:42.147 --> 23:44.247
Get her some orange juice.

23:44.416 --> 23:46.150
Can't she just sleep it off in her car?

23:46.184 --> 23:49.052
- She has gestational diabetes.
- Well, how bad is that?

23:49.087 --> 23:50.287
Bad. She's slipping
into a diabetic coma.

23:51.422 --> 23:55.058
Will you hold my hand?
I'm really scared.

23:56.294 --> 23:59.463
Okay. Um...

24:00.832 --> 24:03.101
It's gonna be okay, all right?

24:03.135 --> 24:05.269
W-we're gonna take care of you.

24:10.883 --> 24:12.818
It's like my mother has a
homing device for trouble.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.119
That's where Tommy gets it.

24:14.154 --> 24:15.788
And we're throwing
Lydia back in the pond

24:15.822 --> 24:17.589
as soon as she gets out of the hospital.

24:17.624 --> 24:19.725
Okay, but we're telling
your mother who she is first.

24:19.759 --> 24:23.396
- I'm calling a family meeting.
- What? It's not your family.

24:23.430 --> 24:25.864
Well, it's my guest house.
And I only have a one-guest policy.

24:26.866 --> 24:29.133
Okay, let's see if we can
solve these murders first.

24:30.235 --> 24:34.937
W-what? Fine, I will get Frankie and
Ma to the Dirty Robber later today.

24:34.972 --> 24:37.974
Good morning, Dr. Isles.
You don't look very well-rested.

24:38.008 --> 24:42.178
- Guess you don't know your limit.
- You don't remember?

24:44.748 --> 24:46.783
Did you do something inappropriate?

24:46.817 --> 24:51.121
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to prepare my presentation

24:51.155 --> 24:55.092
on entrance and exit wounds.
You look stunning, Detective.

24:55.126 --> 24:59.196
Got my fingerprint-enhancement
device. You ready to try it?

24:59.263 --> 25:01.732
Yeah, follow me, Dr. Rube Goldberg.

25:01.766 --> 25:03.600
W... I'm surprised
you know who that is.

25:03.635 --> 25:06.637
Oh, Maura, 25% of the
population uses the internet.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.506
Oh, not fair. It doesn't count
if you have to use google.

25:11.543 --> 25:14.512
Can't get these in a
forensic-supply catalog.

25:14.546 --> 25:17.648
- I put this together myself.
- Never would have guessed.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.588
So, the idea is the electrostatic charge

25:23.622 --> 25:26.558
allows the fingerprint powder
to adhere to the brass casing.

25:26.626 --> 25:28.027
Yep.

25:28.061 --> 25:29.795
Dr. John Bond at Leicester
university developed it.

25:29.829 --> 25:32.165
Classic electrostatic physics.

25:32.199 --> 25:36.136
Shoot, I'm only an expert in
common electrostatic physics.

25:45.747 --> 25:48.515
That's unbelievable.
You got a partial print.

25:48.549 --> 25:50.183
But there isn't enough ridge detail.

25:50.217 --> 25:52.986
All I need is enough to compare
it to a list of patients.

25:56.691 --> 26:02.830
- No tented arch on this one.
- This one, either.

26:02.864 --> 26:04.665
How many patients did we
get elimination prints from?

26:04.700 --> 26:05.933
110 out of a total of 203.

26:06.001 --> 26:09.103
Still got Detectives out there
trying to get the rest of them.

26:13.977 --> 26:15.977
What the hell?

26:18.214 --> 26:20.549
- What is it?
- Nothing.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.783
What?

26:25.221 --> 26:26.622
That's my phone number.

26:27.724 --> 26:29.258
I...

26:30.860 --> 26:32.228
Oh, my god!

26:32.262 --> 26:33.829
You thought I was one
of Dr. Parker's patients?

26:33.864 --> 26:35.164
Nothing to be ashamed of.

26:35.199 --> 26:37.767
I think you've hidden your delusional
disorders rather well, Detective.

26:40.104 --> 26:41.338
He called you three times last week.

26:43.241 --> 26:46.043
I wonder why.

26:48.147 --> 26:53.685
Wha... no.
Hey, Dominick.

26:53.719 --> 26:55.253
Uh, do you know how
long you're gonna be?

26:55.287 --> 26:57.990
- This is my car right here.
- Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.

26:58.058 --> 27:00.727
- That's okay.
- Um...!

27:00.761 --> 27:02.228
It's okay.

27:02.263 --> 27:03.930
- C...can you just put that back
on the rack? - Yes.

27:03.965 --> 27:06.000
- I'll move the truck.
- Okay, thank you.

27:06.034 --> 27:08.302
Hey, you know what?
Why don't you grab a bag of ciabatta?

27:08.336 --> 27:11.638
It's still warm.
It's on the last rack.

27:11.673 --> 27:14.274
- Okay. Thank you.
- Sure.

27:19.146 --> 27:20.113
This one?

27:21.315 --> 27:22.281
Yeah.

27:22.316 --> 27:24.317
Thank you so much.

27:24.319 --> 27:26.820
I'll see you later.
Thank you...

27:36.665 --> 27:39.700
I thought this would help ease
tensions in the family meeting.

27:39.735 --> 27:41.703
- What is it?
- It's a talking stick.

27:41.737 --> 27:43.738
They've been used for
centuries by native americans.

27:43.773 --> 27:45.040
Hmm.

27:45.074 --> 27:47.810
Hey. What's going on?

27:47.844 --> 27:50.046
Where's Jane? She said we
were having a family meeting.

27:50.080 --> 27:52.182
She will be here any minute.

27:52.216 --> 27:54.918
Sit down, Ma.
Take the talking stick.

27:54.953 --> 27:59.055
I don't want the talking stick.
I want to know what this is about.

27:59.090 --> 28:03.660
Well, uh, the talking stick
has been used by many cultures

28:03.695 --> 28:06.063
to designate who
has the right to speak.

28:06.097 --> 28:10.201
Which means the both of you
have something awful to tell me.

28:11.470 --> 28:13.871
Is this about Tommy?

28:15.474 --> 28:18.009
Give me that stick!

28:19.244 --> 28:22.680
Because I have a feeling
that I'm going to have to use this stick

28:22.714 --> 28:24.482
to knock some sense
into your brother.

28:33.261 --> 28:36.764
Her car is still here.

28:36.832 --> 28:38.332
She's not answering her phone.

28:38.367 --> 28:40.701
She left over an hour
ago to meet you guys.

28:40.736 --> 28:44.472
She did?
Oh, my god. Where is she?

28:44.506 --> 28:47.809
Ma, come on.
I'm gonna get you home.

28:47.843 --> 28:51.245
I'm gonna try and track the GPS
on her phone, maybe get a location.

28:51.279 --> 28:53.747
I'll be back. Find her, okay?

28:56.918 --> 29:00.388
No signal on her phone.
Can't track it.

29:00.422 --> 29:02.256
Come on, think! We're in the
middle of this double-homicide case.

29:02.291 --> 29:05.994
- We don't know if it's related.
- We know Dr. Parker called Jane.

29:06.028 --> 29:07.395
The dead guy?
Why'd he call her?

29:07.430 --> 29:09.297
Don't know.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.098
Wait, wait. He...
he treated patients

29:11.133 --> 29:12.933
with severe delusional disorders.

29:13.869 --> 29:16.871
It'd be his ethical obligation
to call and to warn her

29:16.905 --> 29:18.406
if he was treating someone
who was a danger to her.

29:18.440 --> 29:19.941
Put up the patient list, Frost.

29:19.975 --> 29:22.977
And she was getting
strange text messages.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.411
Someone on this list knows something.

29:24.446 --> 29:26.147
Oh, this could take all night.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.015
We can't sit in here
and go through lists!

29:28.049 --> 29:30.217
Okay, what about the partial print
from the casing?

29:30.251 --> 29:34.021
Korsak, what if we tried
to put the two partial prints together?

29:34.055 --> 29:35.856
The one from the glove and the
shell casing? It's a long shot.

29:39.193 --> 29:40.527
We need a few more points.

29:42.430 --> 29:44.264
Rotate it to the left just a bit.

29:46.935 --> 29:47.901
That might work. Run it.

29:57.011 --> 29:59.513
That's the man who
delivers bread to the café.

29:59.547 --> 30:02.783
Dominick Bianchi... served eight
years for stalking and maiming?

30:02.817 --> 30:05.019
- He was Parker's patient.
- You got an address?

30:05.086 --> 30:07.855
- It's just the bakery.
- Oh, hell.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.863
Dominick has erotomanic
delusional disorder.

30:15.898 --> 30:17.131
Doesn't sound good.

30:17.166 --> 30:20.335
It's a serious psychiatric disorder.
He believes a stranger,

30:20.369 --> 30:23.572
most likely someone of a higher
status, is in love with him.

30:23.606 --> 30:25.574
So, he thinks Jane's in love with him?

30:47.261 --> 30:53.032
Hey, honey. 
You missed your brazilian wax.

30:53.066 --> 30:55.835
You were the one who was texting me?

30:55.869 --> 31:00.073
Of course I did, honey.
You're my wife.

31:02.610 --> 31:07.313
- You took off my clothes?
- Oh, yeah.

31:11.552 --> 31:14.921
Do you like your new outfit?

31:18.226 --> 31:19.526
- Yes.
- Yeah?

31:19.560 --> 31:21.095
Mm-hmm.

31:21.129 --> 31:25.266
I love pink and
ruffles and kitten heels.

31:27.002 --> 31:32.407
Oh, good.
Oh, you look so beautiful.

31:33.442 --> 31:37.878
Thank you.
Dominick, um, my wrists really hurt.

31:37.913 --> 31:42.016
Is there any way that we could
loosen these up just a little bit?

31:42.050 --> 31:45.619
Ooh.
Oh, you are sly.

31:45.686 --> 31:47.454
No.

31:50.191 --> 31:55.227
I'm gonna go out and
get dinner for us. Okay?

32:22.104 --> 32:24.372
Give me something!
Checking his financials.

32:24.406 --> 32:27.842
Okay, wait. He bought a bunch
of computer equipment recently.

32:27.876 --> 32:30.044
Looks like he set up a webcam.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.345
Maybe I can use an
inmap to run a port scan.

32:31.379 --> 32:34.715
What, you think you can track
him through the bakery website?

32:37.485 --> 32:38.986
Trying a telnet port.

32:45.294 --> 32:46.928
Yes! I'm in.

32:46.963 --> 32:50.532
He's sending this feed to his bakery
so he can watch her 24/7.

32:53.301 --> 32:55.170
Oh, god, Jane.

32:57.040 --> 32:58.140
That's her apartment!

32:59.309 --> 33:01.477
No, stay here.

33:19.863 --> 33:22.131
<i>Sergeant Korsak, I don't see Dominick.</i>

33:29.573 --> 33:32.375
<i>Damn it! She's not here.</i>

34:03.407 --> 34:06.443
I couldn't see everything
in your bedroom,

34:06.477 --> 34:09.112
so I figured as long
as I got it close...

34:10.947 --> 34:14.051
- Are the sheets okay?
- Yeah, they're fine.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.554
I don't remember having you over.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.322
You know the building across the street?

34:19.358 --> 34:21.492
If you go up the fire escape,
you can see in your window.

34:21.525 --> 34:25.329
When you leave the shades open.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.931
Right.

34:36.409 --> 34:38.409
You remember Hawaii?

34:42.081 --> 34:44.250
Dominick, you know we
never went to Hawaii.

34:45.518 --> 34:46.518
Yes, we did!!

34:48.355 --> 34:50.523
We had our honeymoon there.

34:50.556 --> 34:54.127
We kayaked.
You surfed for the first time.

34:54.161 --> 34:57.398
We went to that all-you-can-eat
Luau with the pig, remember?

34:59.935 --> 35:03.271
Yeah. Yeah, I remember now.

35:03.305 --> 35:07.275
Liar.
Don't play me.

35:07.309 --> 35:10.244
We didn't go to a Luau.

35:16.451 --> 35:19.588
Don't be like Dr. Parker.

35:21.291 --> 35:23.258
Did you tell Dr. Parker about me?

35:23.293 --> 35:25.027
Yeah.

35:25.061 --> 35:27.663
I'm allowed to talk about
my wife with my therapist.

35:27.698 --> 35:29.899
Of course you are.

35:29.933 --> 35:31.033
Damn right!!

35:35.572 --> 35:39.075
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.

35:39.109 --> 35:42.511
Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

35:44.581 --> 35:46.248
I'm sorry.

35:48.150 --> 35:50.151
I deserved that. I'm sorry.

35:55.490 --> 35:58.359
- Oh, god.
- What's she doing?

35:58.393 --> 36:00.594
She has to try to make
him stay in the fantasy.

36:00.628 --> 36:03.263
What if he comes out of it?

36:06.467 --> 36:07.701
We have to find her.

36:07.736 --> 36:09.703
He's live-streaming, but he's smart.

36:09.738 --> 36:12.606
He's hiding the I.P. address.
I can't find it.

36:14.643 --> 36:17.178
Oh, my god.

36:31.337 --> 36:32.871
- Jane.
- She sees it. 

36:35.708 --> 36:39.244
I-I love computers,
Dominick, just like you.

36:39.278 --> 36:41.045
I couldn't use one for a long time,

36:41.080 --> 36:43.314
but I-I read a lot about
them at Bridgewater state.

36:44.950 --> 36:47.952
- Did you miss me?
- Yes, I did.

36:47.986 --> 36:52.856
No, you didn't.
I wasn't there because of you.

36:52.890 --> 36:54.725
<i>I was there because of Emily.</i>

36:54.759 --> 36:55.926
What happened to Emily?

36:55.960 --> 36:57.961
<i>I will always love her.</i>

36:57.995 --> 37:00.096
He threw acid in her face ...
blinded her.

37:00.131 --> 37:02.032
Oh, my god.

37:04.102 --> 37:07.605
<i>I read about you in the paper.</i>

37:07.639 --> 37:09.140
I liked you when we were little

37:09.174 --> 37:11.775
and you used to come
into my parents' bakery.

37:16.181 --> 37:19.751
You knew that you'd grow
up to marry me, didn't you?

37:19.785 --> 37:21.753
Oh, yeah.

37:23.322 --> 37:27.359
Wouldn't it be fun if we put ourselves
on TV as Mr. and Mrs. Bianchi?

37:29.162 --> 37:30.262
That's only for me.

37:30.296 --> 37:33.365
No one else can watch you!

37:35.902 --> 37:37.736
Where do you watch me?

37:44.077 --> 37:47.146
Are you ready for dinner?

37:55.222 --> 37:56.689
Frost.

37:57.891 --> 37:59.759
<i>If you're as good as I know you are,</i>

37:59.793 --> 38:00.793
<i>you can see me right now.</i>

38:01.962 --> 38:04.797
<i>Please tell me you can see me.</i>

38:07.367 --> 38:09.202
<i>Frost, find me.</i>

38:10.236 --> 38:12.740
Please.

38:13.774 --> 38:15.308
I'm praying that somebody can hear me.

38:15.343 --> 38:18.044
Tell us where you are, Janie.
Come on.

38:18.079 --> 38:19.746
Tell us where you are.

38:19.781 --> 38:21.014
<i>Please let somebody hear me.</i>

38:21.049 --> 38:24.351
Please.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.887
Okay. Unh.

38:28.823 --> 38:32.226
<i>I hear, um, airplanes landing.</i>

38:32.260 --> 38:34.294
Must be close to the airport.

38:34.329 --> 38:36.830
Less than ...
than half a mile.

38:36.864 --> 38:42.302
And ...
and I-I hear a bell.

38:44.271 --> 38:46.840
- A warning bell.
- The Chelsea street drawbridge.

38:46.874 --> 38:48.108
<i>Chelsea street drawbridge.</i>

38:48.142 --> 38:49.943
<i>And ...
and I smell fish.</i>

38:50.010 --> 38:52.879
- The processing plant.
- No, that's not enough.

38:52.914 --> 38:53.914
There are hundreds of
buildings in that area.

38:55.483 --> 38:57.851
Frost, zoom in on the
radiator and the window frame.

39:00.288 --> 39:02.322
That's a cast-iron radiator,
manufactured in 1890,

39:02.356 --> 39:04.090
and a wooden window
frame from the same era.

39:04.125 --> 39:07.327
So, we're looking for something built
in the late 1800s that's still standing.

39:07.361 --> 39:09.162
By the processing plant?
They've all been torn down.

39:09.197 --> 39:10.931
Maybe we're not even close.

39:10.965 --> 39:12.399
<i>Please, Frost, please come find me.</i>

39:15.135 --> 39:18.738
I got a building on Falcon street ...
built in 1891.

39:18.772 --> 39:20.039
That's it. Let's go.

39:26.446 --> 39:28.980
Come on! Just eat!

39:30.015 --> 39:31.249
No, thank you.

39:32.283 --> 39:33.518
- I would rather feed myself.
- Fine.

39:33.552 --> 39:37.122
Starve, then!
I heard you talking.

39:37.156 --> 39:38.990
<i>I know you were talking to someon!</i>

39:39.024 --> 39:40.792
<i>Dominick, I was talking to myself.</i>

39:40.826 --> 39:43.996
Don't hurt her.

39:44.030 --> 39:47.032
I'm gonna have to make sure
that you never look at anyone

39:47.066 --> 39:51.269
or talk to anyone...
ever again!

39:52.138 --> 39:53.905
Police! Police! Police!

39:53.940 --> 39:57.042
Don't move! Hands up,
you son of a bitch!

39:58.011 --> 40:00.145
- Jane, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

40:02.081 --> 40:03.315
<i>Frankie, get me out of here, please.</i>

40:03.350 --> 40:07.019
<i> I got you. It's okay.</i>

40:07.053 --> 40:09.321
I'm okay. I'm okay.

40:23.938 --> 40:26.440
Well, the worst part was the outfit.

40:28.110 --> 40:30.478
Pink shoes.
Vomit.

40:32.248 --> 40:36.084
I think Dominick killed Dr. Parker
because he was trying to warn you.

40:36.118 --> 40:37.419
Poor guy.

40:37.453 --> 40:39.487
And Dr. Eve got shot just
'cause she had to pee.

40:39.522 --> 40:42.424
- I mean, that's just wrong.
- In Dominick's mind,

40:42.458 --> 40:44.326
Dr. Parker was breaking
up your marriage.

40:44.360 --> 40:46.528
And what a marriage it would have been.

40:47.397 --> 40:49.064
Did I show you my honeymoon pictures?

40:49.098 --> 40:51.466
- Oh, you went on a honeymoon?
- My head did.

40:51.501 --> 40:52.868
Mm.

40:52.902 --> 40:57.539
Apparently, we missed the Luau.
I always wanted to go to a Luau.

40:57.573 --> 40:59.841
I'm thinking of freezing my eggs.

41:01.944 --> 41:03.512
Okay, how much wine have you had?

41:03.546 --> 41:08.383
Not much.
I just don't think marriage is for me.

41:08.417 --> 41:10.919
But I'd like to preserve
my option to have children.

41:10.953 --> 41:14.223
Okay. I'm gonna leave my
eggs right where they are.

41:15.591 --> 41:17.092
And we're gonna talk
about something else.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.428
- Like what?
- You and Dr. Pike.

41:19.795 --> 41:23.865
- What a cute couple you'd make.
- Mm, very funny.

41:23.900 --> 41:25.000
Very, very funny.

41:28.037 --> 41:29.404
Bet he's Luau kind of guy.

41:36.891 --> 41:40.422
