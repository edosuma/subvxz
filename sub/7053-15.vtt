WEBVTT

00:02.095 --> 00:03.462
What can you tell me about cortexiphan?

00:03.529 --> 00:04.896
It worked on perception.

00:04.964 --> 00:06.431
<i> attention all citizens.</i>

00:06.499 --> 00:07.566
<i>of all of the children</i>

00:07.633 --> 00:09.134
<i>That walter and I prepared,</i>

00:09.202 --> 00:10.836
<i>You were the strongest.</i>

00:10.903 --> 00:12.504
A storm is coming, and when it is over,

00:12.572 --> 00:14.673
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

00:14.740 --> 00:16.842
William bell told me the
man with that marking,

00:18.544 --> 00:20.912
<i>Would try to open a corridor
from our universe</i>

00:20.980 --> 00:22.280
To the other side.

00:22.348 --> 00:23.515
Dr. Bell was afraid

00:23.583 --> 00:25.851
That if the doorway
between the two universes

00:25.918 --> 00:28.053
Was ever opened...

00:28.121 --> 00:30.122
<i>Only one world would remain.</i>

00:45.171 --> 00:47.038
Hey.

00:47.106 --> 00:48.907
Thought you were getting out of here.

00:48.975 --> 00:50.509
Afraid not.

00:50.576 --> 00:53.778
It's gonna be a late one.

00:53.846 --> 00:55.447
Wait a second. Is that--

00:55.515 --> 00:57.782
Is that real coffee?

00:57.850 --> 00:59.017
Where did you get that?

00:59.085 --> 01:00.152
I don't know.

01:00.219 --> 01:01.753
<i>I have my sources. Aha.</i>

01:01.821 --> 01:03.655
I got a cousin in hawaii.

01:03.723 --> 01:05.390
She has a secret stash.
She sends me stuff every--

01:10.229 --> 01:12.097
This is getting nuts.

01:12.165 --> 01:13.932
What is that, six since yesterday?

01:14.000 --> 01:16.868
Yeah, well, I'm from california,
so I'm used to it, you know?

01:16.936 --> 01:19.070
But this is new york.

01:19.138 --> 01:20.272
Don't you think it's strange?

01:20.339 --> 01:22.307
Hmm.

01:24.343 --> 01:26.077
What are they saying on the news?

01:26.145 --> 01:27.412
That they're just these
little quakes, you know?

01:27.480 --> 01:28.813
Microquakes.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.349
<i>Probably just some byproduct of global
warming.</i>

01:31.417 --> 01:34.119
<i>Well, see you tomorrow.</i>

01:34.187 --> 01:35.487
<i>Oh, and if you, uh,</i>

01:35.555 --> 01:37.055
Have any extra coffee...

01:37.123 --> 01:38.156
call me.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.791
Good night, pauline.

01:39.859 --> 01:41.860
<i>Night.</i>

03:20.593 --> 03:22.093
You've got to be kidding me.

03:22.161 --> 03:23.595
<i>congratulations, mr. Bishop.</i>

03:23.663 --> 03:25.597
You've just won an all-expense-paid trip

03:25.665 --> 03:26.998
To new york city.

03:27.066 --> 03:28.566
I thought I told your people

03:28.634 --> 03:30.235
To take me off your contestant list.

03:30.303 --> 03:31.569
<i>Not according to our records.</i>

03:31.637 --> 03:33.505
It says here that you're a fan

03:33.572 --> 03:36.007
Of fine dining and excitement.

03:36.075 --> 03:37.309
Do you have a supervisor?

03:37.376 --> 03:38.977
Anybody there I could complain to?

03:39.045 --> 03:40.412
<i>'cause this has to stop.</i>

03:40.479 --> 03:42.480
Did I mention there's excitement?

03:44.950 --> 03:48.186
Walter, wake up.

03:48.254 --> 03:50.255
We just won an all-expens
e-paid trip to new york city.

03:50.323 --> 03:54.025
That's fantastic.

03:54.093 --> 03:56.961
I've never won anything before.

04:00.366 --> 04:02.100
An earthquake in manhattan.

04:02.168 --> 04:05.103
It's possible, but highly unlikely.

04:05.171 --> 04:07.906
Perhaps a small comet.

04:07.973 --> 04:10.208
Any witnesses?

04:10.276 --> 04:11.743
Witnesses outside felt the ground shake,

04:11.811 --> 04:12.911
But no one saw what happened.

04:32.598 --> 04:34.733
What about the people inside?

04:34.800 --> 04:37.736
Emergency services secured this
entrance into the building,

04:37.803 --> 04:39.270
Scouring the place for survivors.

04:39.338 --> 04:40.305
How many did they find?

04:40.373 --> 04:42.173
Zero.

04:49.048 --> 04:51.116
It looks-- rearranged.

04:53.018 --> 04:55.353
Extraordinary.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.033
<i>oh, my god.</i>

05:13.873 --> 05:15.039
<i>I don't suppose you have any idea</i>

05:15.107 --> 05:16.775
What could have caused this?

05:16.842 --> 05:20.211
Quantum tectonic event
would be my guess.

05:20.279 --> 05:23.715
Until now, this phenomenon
has just been theoretical.

05:25.351 --> 05:26.317
A quantum tectonic event?

05:26.385 --> 05:28.052
<i>Well, yes.</i>

05:28.120 --> 05:30.789
Imagine a sudden momentary disturbance

05:30.856 --> 05:32.557
<i>At a subatomic level.</i>

05:32.625 --> 05:34.159
The energy disperses the atoms,

05:34.226 --> 05:37.028
Literally tearing the very
fabric of reality itself.

05:37.096 --> 05:39.531
Meaning that all the atoms come apart,

05:39.598 --> 05:41.966
<i>But when they reassemble,
they come together all wrong.</i>

05:42.034 --> 05:43.067
<i>so what are the odds of something</i>

05:43.135 --> 05:44.536
Like this occurring naturally?

05:44.603 --> 05:45.904
<i>oh, it's possible.</i>

05:45.971 --> 05:48.606
But if so, god has a far
more disturbed sense of humor

05:48.674 --> 05:50.675
Then even I could have imagined.

05:50.743 --> 05:52.877
Third floor! Let's move!

05:58.150 --> 05:59.250
<i>Help, please.</i>

05:59.318 --> 06:01.319
Hold still, sir.

06:01.387 --> 06:02.687
<i>It's important you try not to move,
okay?</i>

06:02.755 --> 06:04.088
<i>please help.</i>

06:07.760 --> 06:08.927
<i>I don't know if we can cut him
loose from that beam.</i>

06:08.994 --> 06:10.328
<i>He might not survive.</i>

06:10.396 --> 06:11.696
Call my wife.

06:11.764 --> 06:13.064
Someone please call my wife.

06:13.132 --> 06:14.933
<i>I just want to hear her voice.</i>

06:15.000 --> 06:16.434
Mr. Pratchet, I'm special
agent broyles with the fbi.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.869
This is agent dunham.

06:17.937 --> 06:19.404
<i>We're going to do
everything we can</i>

06:19.472 --> 06:23.308
To find your wife and get
you out of here safely.

06:23.375 --> 06:24.609
I'll call this in.

06:24.677 --> 06:26.044
<i>mr. Pratchet,</i>

06:26.111 --> 06:28.213
It would help us a lot

06:28.280 --> 06:30.114
If you could describe
what happened here.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.349
<i>tremors.</i>

06:31.417 --> 06:33.384
Just like the other ones.

06:33.452 --> 06:36.588
Then a really big one that
just kept getting worse.

06:38.691 --> 06:39.757
I'm so thirsty.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.092
He can't drink anything.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.996
<i>Maybe some ice, but no liquids.</i>

06:45.064 --> 06:47.465
I'm on it.

07:00.145 --> 07:01.880
<i>mr. Pratchet,</i>

07:01.947 --> 07:03.381
Did anything unusual happen

07:03.449 --> 07:04.616
Before the disaster?

07:04.683 --> 07:05.917
Maybe someone in the building

07:05.985 --> 07:07.085
Who shouldn't have been here.

07:07.152 --> 07:08.686
No.

07:08.754 --> 07:10.321
Just the same things everyone saw.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.323
Yesterday, the dogs all started howling.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.292
<i>Then all those little tremors.</i>

07:14.360 --> 07:16.461
The microquakes.

07:16.529 --> 07:19.030
Did you hear about any
tremors in new york?

07:32.878 --> 07:34.412
Ted pratchet doesn't have a wife

07:34.480 --> 07:35.680
And it appears he never did.

07:35.748 --> 07:37.549
<i>makes sense.</i>

07:37.616 --> 07:39.284
<i>Trauma from his injuries.</i>

07:39.351 --> 07:40.285
<i>He must be delirious.</i>

07:40.352 --> 07:41.286
I don't think so.

07:41.353 --> 07:42.487
<i>Excuse me, miss.</i>

07:42.555 --> 07:44.622
Thank you. Thank you.

07:44.690 --> 07:46.124
<i>Sir...</i>

07:46.191 --> 07:48.192
What year is it?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.861
2010. Good. Good.

07:49.929 --> 07:51.129
Walter?

07:51.196 --> 07:52.297
And who is the president?

07:52.364 --> 07:53.531
President obama.

07:53.599 --> 07:54.632
Mm-hmm. Good. Good.

07:54.700 --> 07:55.633
Good, good. Now, I'm sorry to do this--

07:55.701 --> 07:57.268
Walter. Hey, walter.

07:57.336 --> 07:58.269
<i>What's the point of this?</i>

07:58.337 --> 08:00.038
Peter.

08:00.105 --> 08:03.041
I'm sorry about this,
but it is very important.

08:03.108 --> 08:06.811
On September the 11th,
when the terrorists struck,

08:06.879 --> 08:10.048
Which buildings did they attack?

08:10.115 --> 08:12.383
The pentagon. Uh-huh.

08:12.451 --> 08:13.818
And...

08:13.886 --> 08:15.753
The white house.

08:23.495 --> 08:27.532
I think I know what happened here.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.167
<i>walter, what is that?</i>

09:08.173 --> 09:09.874
My theory was wrong.

09:09.942 --> 09:11.709
<i>This wasn't a quantum
event at all.</i>

09:11.777 --> 09:15.580
We're standing in two buildings.

09:15.648 --> 09:18.449
One of which comes from
the alternate universe.

09:38.397 --> 09:40.232
I've asked them to send mr.
Pratchet's bodies

09:40.499 --> 09:41.900
Back to the lab.

09:41.967 --> 09:44.068
Maybe they'll provide some insight

09:44.136 --> 09:45.470
Into how this thing happened.

09:45.538 --> 09:46.471
I already know how this happened.

09:46.539 --> 09:48.039
Oh?

09:48.107 --> 09:50.508
Two universes colliding.

09:50.576 --> 09:52.944
This is what william
bell warned me about.

09:53.012 --> 09:55.613
He said that newton would
try to open a doorway

09:55.681 --> 09:58.149
From our universe to the other side

09:58.217 --> 09:59.250
And that when it happened

09:59.318 --> 10:01.453
<i>This would be the consequence.</i>

10:01.520 --> 10:03.788
Two objects trying to
occupy the same space

10:03.856 --> 10:05.457
<i>At the same time.</i>

10:05.524 --> 10:08.393
This was newton. I'm sure of it.

10:08.461 --> 10:10.462
He was here.

10:21.207 --> 10:26.010
Walter, I don't think I can do this.

10:26.078 --> 10:27.679
<i>I've seen some pretty disturbing things
in my time</i>

10:27.746 --> 10:30.181
<i>Working with you, and I think I've
handled them pretty well,</i>

10:30.249 --> 10:34.018
But this...I can't do.

10:34.086 --> 10:36.254
Awful, isn't it?

10:36.322 --> 10:38.790
Those boxes over there have
evidence from the building.

10:38.858 --> 10:40.158
You can go through them.

10:40.226 --> 10:42.360
Thank you.

10:45.064 --> 10:46.865
All right, so what am I looking for?

10:46.932 --> 10:49.033
Anything that looks
like it doesn't belong.

10:49.101 --> 10:52.170
Okay.

10:56.175 --> 10:58.943
<i>I think this qualifies.</i>

10:59.011 --> 11:01.145
Richard nixon on a silver dollar.

11:01.213 --> 11:03.214
That's disturbing.

11:06.051 --> 11:07.352
So when you separate them, walter,

11:07.419 --> 11:08.953
<i>How are you going to
tell them apart?</i>

11:09.021 --> 11:10.989
Mr. Pratchet from over
there was married.

11:11.056 --> 11:12.357
He was wearing a wedding ring.

11:12.424 --> 11:15.426
So as far as his wife will ever know,

11:15.494 --> 11:17.061
He just disappeared?

11:19.064 --> 11:21.199
That is so sad.

11:21.267 --> 11:23.134
Yes, it is.

11:23.202 --> 11:24.536
Wow. Look at this.

11:24.603 --> 11:27.739
It's a double-decker car.

11:27.806 --> 11:31.309
Does this mean that they
drive these over there?

11:31.377 --> 11:33.511
I suppose so.

11:37.283 --> 11:39.150
What?

11:39.218 --> 11:42.654
I know what newton did.

11:46.825 --> 11:48.459
And I'm afraid I've just remembered

11:48.527 --> 11:50.595
What's going to happen next.

11:54.300 --> 11:56.367
<i>newton. He was there.</i>

11:56.435 --> 11:58.703
This was taken two hours
before the incident.

11:58.771 --> 12:00.305
He and his men disguised themselves

12:00.372 --> 12:02.307
As a construction crew.

12:02.374 --> 12:03.808
So how do we find him?

12:03.876 --> 12:05.176
We're running down vin numbers.

12:05.244 --> 12:06.778
We're looking into equipment rental,

12:06.845 --> 12:08.580
But I would like to take
a crew back to new york.

12:09.982 --> 12:11.849
<i>it's walter.</i>

12:11.917 --> 12:13.117
Hey.

12:13.185 --> 12:14.352
Peter, I need you back at the lab.

12:14.420 --> 12:15.720
Agent dunham as well.

12:15.788 --> 12:17.221
Walter, we're right in
the middle of something.

12:17.289 --> 12:18.590
Don't argue with me, son.

12:18.657 --> 12:20.558
Get back here now, both of you.

12:26.332 --> 12:28.299
<i>that is what's so important?</i>

12:28.367 --> 12:31.002
This happened almost 25 years ago

12:31.070 --> 12:32.170
<i>Right here on campus.</i>

12:32.237 --> 12:33.304
<i>I know.</i>

12:33.372 --> 12:34.439
<i>I've heard this story before.</i>

12:34.506 --> 12:35.607
<i>M.I.T. Students fused a car</i>

12:35.674 --> 12:36.975
<i>To the statue of john harvard.</i>

12:37.042 --> 12:38.509
It was a prank.
They had to cut the car away.

12:38.577 --> 12:39.644
They never figured out how they did it.

12:39.712 --> 12:41.279
This wasn't m.I.T. Students, was it?

12:41.347 --> 12:42.614
This was one of your experiments?

12:42.681 --> 12:45.216
When billy and I first tried to generate

12:45.284 --> 12:47.352
A stable door between universes,

12:47.419 --> 12:49.787
Our first test subject was a car--

12:49.855 --> 12:52.256
Billy's old monte carl
o- and it did not go well.

12:52.324 --> 12:53.992
First times are always sloppy.

12:54.059 --> 12:56.327
It wasn't our first time.

12:56.395 --> 12:59.864
11 minutes after we successfully
made the car disappear,

12:59.932 --> 13:02.000
This car appeared from another reality.

13:02.067 --> 13:03.768
How do you know that wasn't
just pulled from down the block?

13:03.836 --> 13:04.769
It was in 1986.

13:04.837 --> 13:06.204
<i>The car had a cd player.</i>

13:06.271 --> 13:07.572
<i>It wasn't an option at the time.</i>

13:07.640 --> 13:09.974
Okay, assuming what you're
saying is true, why?

13:10.042 --> 13:13.144
I mean, how did the car appear?

13:13.212 --> 13:15.813
<i>the universe seeks balance.</i>

13:15.881 --> 13:18.549
<i>We sent a car over there,
so a car of equal mass came back.</i>

13:21.253 --> 13:25.957
Now, a building from the
other side appeared here.

13:26.025 --> 13:28.693
The laws of physics demand both
sides of the equation balance.

13:28.761 --> 13:31.763
I calculate that a
building from this side

13:31.830 --> 13:33.698
Will be pulled over there,

13:33.766 --> 13:36.067
Inhabitants and all...

13:36.135 --> 13:37.702
Within the next...

13:37.770 --> 13:40.004
Just under 35 hours.

13:40.072 --> 13:42.640
Okay, so how do we stop it?

13:42.708 --> 13:44.542
That's the thing,
agent dunham. We can't.

13:44.610 --> 13:46.244
Okay, then we need to
evacuate the building.

13:46.311 --> 13:48.613
So how do we identify which
building it's going to be?

13:48.681 --> 13:50.314
Well, the one thing
that billy and I learned

13:50.382 --> 13:51.482
From our experience

13:51.550 --> 13:54.485
Is that when objects
from the other universe

13:54.553 --> 13:58.089
Cross to our side, they have an energy.

13:58.157 --> 14:00.425
Someone once described it as a glimmer.

14:02.795 --> 14:04.962
I believe that in the
moments before the event

14:05.030 --> 14:07.865
When the fabric of the two
universes is rubbing together,

14:07.933 --> 14:09.200
That the building on this side

14:09.268 --> 14:12.870
Will begin to take on that glimmer.

14:12.938 --> 14:14.372
So then we'd be able to see it?

14:14.440 --> 14:15.773
Well, unfortunately, no.

14:15.841 --> 14:17.842
It's not visible to the human eye.

14:17.910 --> 14:19.110
Then how the hell are we
going to find it, walter?

14:19.178 --> 14:20.945
We can't, peter!

14:21.013 --> 14:22.613
But you can, agent dunham.

14:22.681 --> 14:24.215
How can I see it?

14:24.283 --> 14:27.118
Because you saw it once before.

14:32.999 --> 14:35.000
Walter, when did I see
things from the other side?

14:35.117 --> 14:36.952
26 years ago when you
were a little girl.

14:37.019 --> 14:39.120
The cortexiphan trials.

14:39.188 --> 14:41.656
As I've said, the drug
worked on perception.

14:41.724 --> 14:44.893
Of the 30 children that william
bell and I experimented on,

14:44.961 --> 14:46.795
You were the first with the ability

14:46.862 --> 14:48.997
To identify things from the other side.

14:49.065 --> 14:50.732
We gave you the ability.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.100
<i>walter, you were conducting
illegal drug trials</i>

14:52.168 --> 14:53.335
On children.

14:53.402 --> 14:55.971
Don't make that sound like charity work.

14:56.038 --> 14:58.306
Was it me who described it as a glimmer?

14:58.374 --> 14:59.774
Well, I can't see it anymore.

14:59.842 --> 15:01.977
Because I believe you
stopped wanting to.

15:02.044 --> 15:03.311
When you did, there were consequences,

15:03.379 --> 15:06.781
But I was able to
elicit the ability once.

15:06.849 --> 15:08.850
I believe I may be able to do it again.

15:08.918 --> 15:10.285
<i>don't be ridiculous.</i>

15:10.353 --> 15:12.520
You're not experimenting on olivia,
and besides--

15:12.588 --> 15:14.356
Okay, I'll do it. Olivia--

15:14.423 --> 15:16.057
We don't have time, so just
tell me what it is I need to do.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.359
First, I need a plane.

15:17.426 --> 15:20.128
I need to go to jacksonville
to the lab where billy and I

15:20.196 --> 15:22.264
First conducted the cortexiphan trials.

15:22.331 --> 15:23.965
It's a day care center
you attended as a child.

15:24.033 --> 15:25.467
I should be able to recreate
the procedure there.

15:25.534 --> 15:28.036
Walter, jacksonville's 1,000 miles away.

15:28.104 --> 15:29.204
It's 1,016 to be exact,

15:29.272 --> 15:31.006
Not counting the trip to the airport.

15:31.073 --> 15:33.008
<i>Look, walter, I'm sure
whatever you need,</i>

15:33.075 --> 15:34.409
<i>We can get it here.</i>

15:34.477 --> 15:37.646
<i>What I need is in jacksonville!</i>

15:37.713 --> 15:40.448
Jacksonville is where
the process worked.

15:40.516 --> 15:43.385
If I am able to do it again,
it has to be there.

15:48.691 --> 15:51.793
A building in manhattan is
just going to disappear?

15:51.861 --> 15:54.496
Yes, that's what walter believes.

15:54.563 --> 15:56.831
What makes him think whatever
he needs to trigger this ability

15:56.899 --> 15:59.601
Of yours is still inside the
facility in jacksonville?

15:59.669 --> 16:02.003
When william bell
founded massive dynamic,

16:02.071 --> 16:04.406
He bought the building and
the entire military base

16:04.473 --> 16:06.174
It was sitting on from the government.

16:06.242 --> 16:07.609
He shut it down and closed it off.

16:07.677 --> 16:10.445
I believe that everything
is still inside.

16:10.513 --> 16:13.014
And you're sure you want to do this?

16:13.082 --> 16:14.916
Submit yourself to dr.
Bishop's experiments?

16:14.984 --> 16:18.053
I don't see another choice.

16:20.156 --> 16:21.890
Then how can I help?

16:21.957 --> 16:24.059
The events that ted pratchet said

16:24.126 --> 16:25.427
Led up to the incident--

16:25.494 --> 16:27.896
The dogs howling,
the small earthquakes--

16:27.963 --> 16:30.198
Walter thinks that they
will likely occur again

16:30.266 --> 16:32.901
And that we can use them to
infer when it's about to happen.

16:32.968 --> 16:35.036
I'll contact nina sharp,

16:35.104 --> 16:36.571
Ask to her to have
massive dynamic enlist

16:36.639 --> 16:38.707
Their geologic division to
track any seismic activity.

16:38.774 --> 16:42.344
Thank you. And dunham?

16:42.411 --> 16:43.778
Stay in touch.

16:43.846 --> 16:45.847
I will.

17:16.310 --> 17:17.912
5...

17:19.781 --> 17:22.316
20...

17:22.384 --> 17:23.651
10.

17:23.719 --> 17:25.051
I always use the same combination,

17:25.119 --> 17:28.021
Though I can't remember
the significance.

18:17.673 --> 18:20.041
Come.

18:36.591 --> 18:38.592
Do you see anything?

18:40.495 --> 18:41.862
Like what?

18:41.930 --> 18:45.166
16 items in this room...

18:45.233 --> 18:48.069
Are from the other side.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.542
Perhaps if you look a little closer.

18:54.609 --> 18:55.743
Come.

19:12.759 --> 19:13.527
Go ahead.

19:28.010 --> 19:30.611
Nothing.

19:33.132 --> 19:34.699
Well...

19:34.767 --> 19:37.702
We should get started.

19:37.770 --> 19:39.537
I was hoping to avoid this.

21:30.382 --> 21:32.650
I have a freakishly good memory.

21:32.718 --> 21:35.086
I remember everything.

21:35.153 --> 21:36.454
But not this.

21:40.125 --> 21:42.326
There's just nothing that's familiar.

21:42.394 --> 21:44.295
Maybe that's a good thing.

21:51.837 --> 21:54.138
You just about ready?

21:56.942 --> 22:00.344
You may want to change into
something more comfortable.

22:07.686 --> 22:13.224
<i>Perception is largely an
emotional response.</i>

22:13.292 --> 22:15.793
How we feel...

22:15.861 --> 22:18.629
Affects the way we see the world.

22:18.697 --> 22:22.033
And so billy and I reasoned
that extreme emotions

22:22.100 --> 22:23.734
Would stimulate this perception,

22:23.802 --> 22:25.269
That acute feelings of fear

22:25.337 --> 22:29.807
<i>And love or anger would
heighten the awareness.</i>

22:29.875 --> 22:31.909
Open the mind, as it were.

22:31.977 --> 22:33.678
<i>The drugs help, of course.</i>

22:33.745 --> 22:35.947
Is that cortexiphan?

22:36.014 --> 22:38.616
Start the I.V. Drip, please,

22:38.684 --> 22:40.117
And lift up.

22:47.559 --> 22:49.193
You sure you want to do this?

22:49.261 --> 22:51.996
<i>oh, wait!</i>

22:52.064 --> 22:53.631
Right arm.

22:58.637 --> 22:59.637
No, left arm. Left arm.

23:04.176 --> 23:06.577
When you're under, the drugs
will generate an obstacle.

23:06.645 --> 23:08.179
I can't tell you what it will be.

23:08.246 --> 23:09.914
It will be uniquely yours.
Do you understand?

23:09.982 --> 23:11.282
I think so.

23:11.350 --> 23:13.184
<i>It will make more sense
when you're under.</i>

23:13.251 --> 23:15.519
<i>The point is this.</i>

23:15.587 --> 23:20.157
That facing that obstacle will
elevate your emotional state.

23:20.225 --> 23:23.361
Much as running on a treadmill
will elevate your heartbeat.

23:23.428 --> 23:25.796
<i>And then when I've got you
to the proper level,</i>

23:25.864 --> 23:29.200
Well, then I'll pull you out, okay?

23:29.267 --> 23:31.702
I am singing in the rain.

23:31.770 --> 23:33.304
Oh.

23:33.372 --> 23:36.307
<i>The drugs are working fast.</i>

23:36.375 --> 23:37.475
Perhaps it was the right arm.

23:37.542 --> 23:38.743
What?

23:38.810 --> 23:40.778
She'll be fine, peter.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.250
Peter...

23:46.318 --> 23:48.285
<i>Would you turn that around?</i>

23:48.353 --> 23:49.553
<i>Thank you.</i>

23:51.390 --> 23:54.792
Olivia, I want you to open your eyes.

23:58.797 --> 24:00.197
Olivia, can you hear me?

24:00.265 --> 24:03.067
If you can hear me, open your eyes.

24:08.173 --> 24:11.175
<i>Where are you?</i>

24:15.013 --> 24:19.550
I'm in a forest.

24:19.618 --> 24:21.652
I can see very tall trees.

24:21.720 --> 24:24.155
That's good. That's good, olivia.

24:26.858 --> 24:28.159
Theta rhythms are normal.

24:28.226 --> 24:31.095
<i>Stable neocortex active.</i>

24:31.163 --> 24:32.496
It's working.

24:40.806 --> 24:42.106
There's someone else here.

25:09.367 --> 25:10.401
Is she all right?

25:10.469 --> 25:11.602
No, but she's not supposed to be.

25:11.670 --> 25:12.803
<i>In my bag, peter.</i>

25:16.708 --> 25:17.842
Yeah?

25:17.909 --> 25:19.910
The pretzels.

25:23.582 --> 25:25.349
Pretzels.

25:53.044 --> 25:55.045
<i>hey.</i>

25:56.915 --> 25:58.115
It's all right.

25:58.183 --> 25:59.150
<i>Please.</i>

25:59.217 --> 26:01.519
I don't want to do this anymore.

26:01.586 --> 26:04.188
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

26:04.256 --> 26:08.125
You don't have to do anything
that you don't want to do.

26:14.699 --> 26:17.134
Wait!

26:17.202 --> 26:18.235
Hey!

26:20.705 --> 26:21.639
Walter?

26:21.706 --> 26:23.107
Shh. She's close.

26:23.175 --> 26:26.610
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

26:28.513 --> 26:30.314
It's okay. Shh.

26:30.382 --> 26:32.850
Shh.

26:33.919 --> 26:35.619
Shh.

26:35.687 --> 26:37.688
Please. Make them stop.

26:37.756 --> 26:39.323
Please make them stop it.

26:41.593 --> 26:43.527
It's okay. I'm here now.

26:43.595 --> 26:45.362
Nothing can hurt you.

26:45.430 --> 26:48.999
It's okay.

26:49.067 --> 26:52.336
That's better.

26:55.740 --> 26:57.341
What's your name?

26:57.409 --> 27:00.945
Olive.

27:15.760 --> 27:17.962
olivia.

27:18.029 --> 27:18.963
ah!

27:25.437 --> 27:28.305
Good news.

27:28.373 --> 27:29.974
<i>It worked.</i>

27:30.041 --> 27:31.575
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:33.645 --> 27:36.313
You did this to little children?

27:41.686 --> 27:44.622
We should get to work.

28:29.335 --> 28:30.302
Anything?

28:30.569 --> 28:31.703
Nothing.

28:31.771 --> 28:33.204
<i>Now what?</i>

28:33.272 --> 28:35.507
Should we find some more kids to scare?

28:40.479 --> 28:44.482
I have no idea.

29:05.738 --> 29:07.405
Phillip, it's me.

29:14.914 --> 29:16.414
Dunham.

29:16.482 --> 29:18.183
It started.

29:18.250 --> 29:20.885
Okay.

29:33.365 --> 29:37.769
<i> </i>

29:37.837 --> 29:39.237
<i>is she okay?</i>

29:39.305 --> 29:40.638
<i>she's fine.</i>

29:40.706 --> 29:42.974
<i>hell, do we know what
triggered it?</i>

29:43.042 --> 29:45.310
<i>obviously she was upset, william.</i>

29:45.377 --> 29:47.946
<i>It's okay. It's all right, olive.</i>

29:54.753 --> 29:57.489
That's me.

29:57.556 --> 30:00.725
What happened?

30:00.793 --> 30:03.728
This was the first time
you saw the other side.

30:03.796 --> 30:07.031
<i>You were frightened.</i>

30:07.099 --> 30:08.900
Started a fire with your mind.

30:12.104 --> 30:14.072
It should have worked.

30:14.139 --> 30:15.340
This is the very sort of thing

30:15.407 --> 30:16.774
That william and I were preparing for.

30:16.842 --> 30:19.944
You abused us, walte
r- me and those other children.

30:20.012 --> 30:22.680
No, we--we were trying to help you.

30:22.748 --> 30:24.749
We were trying to make
you more than you were.

30:24.817 --> 30:27.785
Is that what you were doing?

30:27.853 --> 30:29.587
Or were you searching
for answers to questions

30:29.655 --> 30:31.089
That you shouldn't have been
asking in the first place?

30:31.156 --> 30:32.690
I was a different man then.

30:32.758 --> 30:34.325
I was a defenseless child.

30:40.566 --> 30:42.567
Yes, you were.

30:47.473 --> 30:51.175
Yes, you were.

30:51.243 --> 30:53.244
Olivia, I think I'm
starting to understand

30:53.312 --> 30:54.646
Why the process didn't work.

30:54.713 --> 30:56.447
You are different.

30:56.515 --> 30:58.883
You're not that
frightened child anymore.

30:58.951 --> 31:02.220
<i>I thought all we needed
was a heightened</i>

31:02.288 --> 31:04.222
Emotional response from you,
but I was wrong.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.291
We needed a specific one. Fear.

31:06.358 --> 31:09.494
<i>And you're not capable of that
anymore.</i>

31:09.562 --> 31:11.529
Well, not like she was.

31:11.597 --> 31:13.298
What we did to you--

31:13.365 --> 31:15.867
You found a way to protect yourself.

31:15.935 --> 31:17.802
You channeled your fear into anger,

31:17.870 --> 31:22.907
<i>Which is why you were so
good at your job.</i>

31:22.975 --> 31:26.244
But if you want to save those people,

31:26.312 --> 31:28.813
You have to find your way back

31:28.881 --> 31:30.582
<i>To that scared little girl.</i>

31:30.649 --> 31:33.084
And how do we do that?

31:33.152 --> 31:35.453
I don't know.

32:59.838 --> 33:01.839
Hey.

33:07.312 --> 33:10.248
Is this a part of walter's test?

33:17.089 --> 33:19.357
Are you all right?

33:22.895 --> 33:25.830
No.

33:25.898 --> 33:29.434
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

33:36.358 --> 33:38.259
Ok, let me know if anything changes.

33:38.527 --> 33:41.295
Four tremors in the last two hours.

33:41.363 --> 33:43.297
Most recent measured 2.6.

33:43.365 --> 33:45.166
They're increasing in frequency.

33:52.040 --> 33:55.009
I'm sorry.

33:55.077 --> 33:57.812
You didn't send that building over here.

33:57.879 --> 33:59.313
So what's plan "b"?

33:59.381 --> 34:01.082
We're compiling data.

34:01.149 --> 34:03.551
Trying to predict where the
next incident will take place.

34:03.619 --> 34:05.052
<i>Satellite images,</i>

34:05.120 --> 34:06.320
Seismic activity, weather patterns.

34:06.388 --> 34:07.555
You need a fresh set of eyes?

34:07.623 --> 34:09.724
Yes. I'll take you to the lab.

34:15.964 --> 34:19.300
We've still got time.

34:20.702 --> 34:22.837
We've been plotting the
epicenter of each microquake

34:22.904 --> 34:25.005
Looking for some sort of pattern.

34:25.072 --> 34:26.873
Can you regress any of the data points?

34:26.942 --> 34:28.342
<i>it's a waste of time.</i>

34:28.409 --> 34:32.612
Useless attempt to impose order
on random, meaningless data.

34:32.681 --> 34:34.248
Tried the same thing 25 years ago

34:34.315 --> 34:36.384
When the car came over,
and tried to tell them why.

34:36.451 --> 34:37.585
Why there?

34:37.652 --> 34:40.187
Why'd it land in the middle of the quad?

34:40.255 --> 34:42.322
<i>The answer is there
was no answer.</i>

34:42.391 --> 34:43.924
Except mass.

34:43.992 --> 34:45.393
<i>The two cars.</i>

34:45.460 --> 34:48.228
You said they were the same mass.

34:48.297 --> 34:49.830
Okay, you two have something going on?

34:49.898 --> 34:50.998
Do you want to fill me in?

34:51.065 --> 34:52.366
Walter seems to think
that the two universes

34:52.434 --> 34:53.534
Have to be in balance.

34:53.601 --> 34:55.369
So a building from over
there travels over here.

34:55.437 --> 34:56.971
That means a building over
here of exactly the same mass

34:57.039 --> 34:58.205
Has to travel back.

34:58.273 --> 35:00.441
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Raiders of the lost ark.</i>

35:00.509 --> 35:02.043
The bag of sand and the idol.

35:02.110 --> 35:04.278
Not the metaphor I would have used,
but, yes, exactly.

35:04.346 --> 35:05.279
Do you have a pencil?

35:05.347 --> 35:06.781
I have a pen.

35:06.848 --> 35:08.683
I need satellite data and 3-d imagery

35:08.750 --> 35:09.917
To calculate the cubic feet.

35:09.985 --> 35:10.951
I'll also need a comprehensive list

35:11.019 --> 35:12.553
Of all building materials

35:12.621 --> 35:13.888
Used during construction.

35:13.955 --> 35:17.458
For every freestanding
structure in new york city?

35:17.526 --> 35:21.028
Oh, I think we can rule out
the empire state building.

35:21.096 --> 35:23.631
<i>hey, peter. Anything?</i>

35:23.699 --> 35:25.700
<i>good news.</i>

35:25.767 --> 35:27.068
We have a plan.

35:39.348 --> 35:41.482
Okay, he can eliminate the
three buildings in tribeca,

35:41.550 --> 35:42.483
Because they're way too big.

35:42.551 --> 35:44.452
Are they lofts? Yeah, why?

35:44.519 --> 35:45.986
Lofts have no interior walls.

35:46.054 --> 35:47.355
Even though one of the
buildings might be bigger,

35:47.422 --> 35:48.389
They could be the same mass.

35:48.457 --> 35:50.057
Yep.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.159
Okay, well, the guys
downstairs on the supercomputer

35:52.227 --> 35:53.327
Are crunching numbers on
the first six buildings,

35:53.395 --> 35:55.129
But it's gonna take some time.

35:55.197 --> 35:57.498
What else can I do to help?

36:00.502 --> 36:01.702
It's time.

36:06.241 --> 36:09.510
It could happen any moment now.

36:09.578 --> 36:11.312
Olivia--

36:11.380 --> 36:12.913
How many buildings are we down to?

36:12.981 --> 36:15.015
147 buildings

36:15.083 --> 36:18.185
Spread out all over manhattan.

36:18.253 --> 36:20.588
Three hospitals,
a cancer treatment center,

36:20.655 --> 36:21.956
A nursing home.

36:22.023 --> 36:23.557
The nypd and the fire department

36:23.625 --> 36:25.459
Have a standing evacuation protocol.

36:25.527 --> 36:27.595
With our help, they could clear
most of those buildings--

36:27.662 --> 36:30.231
The evacuation itself would
kill a lot of these people.

36:30.298 --> 36:31.465
Not to mention cause a city-wide panic

36:31.533 --> 36:34.468
That might kill thousands more.

36:36.772 --> 36:39.740
The largest building on this list has,
what, 500 people?

36:39.808 --> 36:43.878
So you think we should just
let the building disappear?

36:43.945 --> 36:46.180
Let those people disappear?

36:46.248 --> 36:49.750
There are times when the
only choices you have left

36:49.818 --> 36:51.585
Are bad ones.

37:00.195 --> 37:01.762
Hey, I figured if I could shut down

37:01.830 --> 37:02.864
All the non-essential functions,

37:03.231 --> 37:04.198
I can make these things run faster.

37:04.616 --> 37:07.251
It's too late.

37:07.318 --> 37:09.686
I failed.

37:09.754 --> 37:11.588
I failed and I'm supposed to be the one

37:11.656 --> 37:14.057
Who can stop things like this.

37:14.125 --> 37:16.660
Olivia.

37:18.997 --> 37:20.998
You--

37:24.202 --> 37:26.136
I've never met anyone

37:26.204 --> 37:29.206
Who can do the things that you do.

37:35.079 --> 37:38.048
Peter.

37:45.223 --> 37:47.624
I'm scared.

37:47.692 --> 37:50.194
Don't be.

37:54.766 --> 37:56.867
What?

37:56.935 --> 37:59.236
Peter, I'm scared.

38:28.157 --> 38:29.424
It was in the west village
near the hudson, I think.

38:29.992 --> 38:31.559
I couldn't see exactly where.

38:31.627 --> 38:32.827
<i>was it near the piers?</i>

38:32.895 --> 38:34.429
<i>Yeah, a couple of blocks from the
river.</i>

38:34.496 --> 38:35.430
Were there any landmarks?

38:35.497 --> 38:36.831
Other buildings nearby there?

38:36.899 --> 38:39.467
Yeah, that new tower,
the one near the elevated tracks.

38:39.535 --> 38:41.002
The high line.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.303
Still too many potential candidates.

38:42.371 --> 38:43.838
Whoa!

38:43.906 --> 38:45.406
whoa!

38:45.474 --> 38:47.275
Hey, olivia, we need
you to narrow it down--

38:47.342 --> 38:48.509
<i>I'm trying.</i>

38:54.349 --> 38:55.483
<i>Okay, I see it.</i>

38:55.551 --> 38:56.651
It's on washington.

38:56.718 --> 38:58.786
Peter, there was a hotel on washington.

38:58.854 --> 39:00.188
<i>what do we have on washington?</i>

39:00.255 --> 39:01.722
No, he's right. Brayson place hotel.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.191
13th and washington,
number's right there.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.460
Call chief solomon at the nypd.

39:05.527 --> 39:06.928
Call the fire department,
and-- hello, yes.

39:06.995 --> 39:09.063
This is special agent phillip
broyles with the fbi.

39:09.131 --> 39:12.033
You need to evacuate everyone
from the building immediately.

39:35.724 --> 39:38.259
Is everybody out? I think so.

40:35.250 --> 40:36.384
I guess it's safe to say

40:36.451 --> 40:39.687
That you've got the rest
of the night off work.

40:52.100 --> 40:54.936
The conspiracy nuts are
gonna have a field day.

40:55.003 --> 40:56.604
You'd be surprised what you can make

40:56.672 --> 40:58.339
The general public believe.

41:04.313 --> 41:05.479
You saved a lot of people.

41:08.050 --> 41:09.817
We all did.

41:09.885 --> 41:11.652
Dunham...

41:13.288 --> 41:14.822
<i>This ability you've
demonstrated...</i>

41:14.890 --> 41:17.925
What finally activated it?

41:17.993 --> 41:20.361
I think it was just time.

41:23.765 --> 41:25.199
<i>Yeah, monopoly is great.</i>

41:25.267 --> 41:27.034
He loves the colored money.

41:27.102 --> 41:28.970
Okay. Thanks again.

41:29.037 --> 41:30.071
I'll see you soon.

41:30.138 --> 41:31.572
Hey, walter, that was astrid.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.574
She's gonna come over and
play some games with you.

41:33.642 --> 41:35.242
Oh...Good.

41:35.310 --> 41:36.344
I hope she likes monopoly.

41:37.412 --> 41:39.480
Where are you going?

41:39.548 --> 41:40.748
Me? I'm going out for drinks.

41:40.816 --> 41:42.049
Oh, who are you drinking with?

41:42.117 --> 41:43.651
Olivia. Agent dunham?

41:43.719 --> 41:44.919
A date?

41:44.987 --> 41:46.420
No, just drinks.

41:46.488 --> 41:48.122
Apparently, that's
what normal people do.

41:48.190 --> 41:49.790
<i>They go out for drinks.</i>

42:10.679 --> 42:13.014
If you need to reach me,

42:13.081 --> 42:15.783
I'll leave you the number of the
restaurant right here, okay?

42:17.152 --> 42:18.786
She's here, peter.

42:18.854 --> 42:20.488
I know, I heard it too.

42:20.555 --> 42:22.423
Shall I get the door?

42:22.491 --> 42:23.924
Absolutely not.

42:23.992 --> 42:25.126
In fact, it would be my preference

42:25.193 --> 42:26.894
If you could be someplace
else all together.

42:26.962 --> 42:28.029
Oh...Where?

42:28.096 --> 42:29.363
Chicago?

42:31.400 --> 42:32.466
Hey. Hi.

42:32.534 --> 42:33.968
Come on in.

42:35.470 --> 42:37.371
<i>I know a great place.</i>

42:37.439 --> 42:39.940
<i>It's just a couple blocks away.
I thought we'd walk.</i>

42:40.008 --> 42:41.842
Agent dunham.

42:46.081 --> 42:47.281
I'll go get my coat.

43:01.496 --> 43:03.564
Olivia.

43:03.632 --> 43:04.965
please don't tell him.
