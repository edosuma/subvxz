[man 1] <i>We've gotta</i>

00:45.560 --> 00:48.200
<i>what I believe to be </i>
<i>the very best circumstances,</i>

00:48.280 --> 00:50.680
<i>and that's to have </i>

[man 2] <i>Marriage is</i>
<i>between a man and a woman</i>

01:02.240 --> 01:04.879
<i>because of children,</i>
<i>because motherhood and</i>
<i>fatherhood are important.</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:06.600
[woman 1]
<i>What a load of rubbish.</i>

01:13.120 --> 01:16.320
<i>[man 3] </i>
<i>Legalizing same-sex marriage</i>

01:16.400 --> 01:19.040
<i>the motherless family,</i>
<i>or the fatherless family.</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:21.880
<i>It will inflict that</i>
<i>deprivation on those children.</i>

[man 4] <i> Same-sex</i>
<i>couples cannot simultaneously</i>

[boy] <i>I didn't have a dad</i>

02:07.080 --> 02:09.840
<i>so I had this thing</i>
<i>called a donor.</i>

02:11.880 --> 02:15.720
A donor is when
a man delivers sperm

02:15.800 --> 02:19.280
into the hospital,
into a little container,

02:19.360 --> 02:21.440
and then they freeze
it so it's all fresh.

02:21.520 --> 02:25.520
And then they give it to
the woman's, two women,

02:25.600 --> 02:29.480
that wanna have a baby,
and then they have a baby.

02:30.520 --> 02:34.520
And we did that,
and now I'm here.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.960

the stockings together, Jen?

02:44.120 --> 02:45.640
Okay, here we go.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.640
One Santa and reindeer
platter coming up.

02:55.040 --> 02:57.800
Look at that,
that is definitely
reindeers go for that.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.400
I know reindeers,
I know how they eat.

03:02.120 --> 03:03.640
Like savages.

03:06.160 --> 03:07.960
And you gotta write the note.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.760
Didn't you have a note
when you were a kid?
That's what's wrong with you,

03:10.840 --> 03:12.520
you didn't have
a note from Santa

03:12.600 --> 03:15.200
to say thanks
for all the stuff.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.320
You don't have to eat it,
you can spit it out.

03:50.120 --> 03:54.040
[Rory] Look, it's
Santa's footprints!

03:54.640 --> 03:58.320
[Jamie] Oh it is too,
he must have
come down the slide!

03:58.400 --> 04:00.640
It's reindeer's footprints!

04:00.720 --> 04:02.520
[Jamie] Check it out!

04:03.320 --> 04:07.080
I don't know if
Santy's got horseshoes,
does he, reindeer shoes?

04:07.160 --> 04:09.400
[Gus]
It must be the reindeer.

04:09.480 --> 04:13.640
I know,Mum,
those are Santa's reindeers,

04:13.720 --> 04:15.960
this is Santa's foot.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.920
You see Rory,
they must have gone from here,

04:19.000 --> 04:22.640
did a big jump, landed here,

04:22.720 --> 04:25.040
and then they must
have started to fly.

04:25.120 --> 04:28.200
That's why there aren't
any more footprints,
am I right, Amanda?

04:30.040 --> 04:32.680
[television blaring]

04:37.000 --> 04:40.600
I love wrestling
more than every

04:40.680 --> 04:43.960
teensy little grain
of sand in the world.

04:45.520 --> 04:49.000
Then, fly in a spaceship
across space,

04:49.400 --> 04:52.560
and scatter them on
every single star.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.880
And then that's how
much I like wrestling.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.960
[Gus humming happily]

05:03.240 --> 05:05.400
-[Gus] I was wondering.
-[Jen] Yeah?

05:05.480 --> 05:08.200
You know when the
WWE comes to Australia?

05:08.960 --> 05:10.800
-[Jen] Yeah?
-Can I go?

05:10.880 --> 05:12.720
[Jen] Do you want this paper?

05:13.640 --> 05:16.600
Do not try and
change the subject.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.600
[Jen] Can you go to wrestling?

05:18.680 --> 05:20.960
Yeah, when it comes
to Australia, please?

05:23.040 --> 05:25.360
I don't know, we'll have
to discuss it with Jamie.

05:25.440 --> 05:26.920
[Gus] Come on!

05:27.000 --> 05:28.840
We'll discuss it.

05:30.520 --> 05:31.640
How do you feel about it?

05:31.720 --> 05:35.760
Well, you know I worry
that it's just the worst...

05:35.840 --> 05:36.960
I've heard this before!

05:37.040 --> 05:40.040
...buffhead,
male thing that exists.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.080
[Gus] It's the best buffhead
male thing that exists!

05:44.600 --> 05:47.480
Oh dear, the wrestling,
the wrestling.

05:49.280 --> 05:52.880
What are we gonna do
about the wrestling, hm?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.360

<i>Let's do a breathing exercise.</i>

<i>And out.</i>

06:19.880 --> 06:22.840
[Ebony] When you sing,
you just forget everything else.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.280
<i>And out.</i>

06:25.360 --> 06:27.360
Especially
when you're stressed,
you just start singing

06:27.440 --> 06:30.880
and you forget that
you're angry about something,

06:30.960 --> 06:33.400
and you just listen to the song,
and you pretend you're there.

[Ebony] <i>I really</i>
<i>wanna get into Newtown.</i>

06:43.840 --> 06:45.680
<i>It's a really good school.</i>

06:47.200 --> 06:50.840
<i>If I went there, it'd</i>
<i>probably be the place</i>
<i>where I'd most be accepted.</i>

06:55.200 --> 06:59.440
Having two mums
you're probably gonna
have a better time of it,

06:59.720 --> 07:02.440
being at Newtown
than you would in

07:02.520 --> 07:06.800
a school out west,
where they may not
be quite so tolerant

07:06.880 --> 07:08.360
of the fact that
you have two moms.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.160
In Newtown, no one's
even gonna blink

07:10.240 --> 07:11.800
at the fact that
you have two moms.

07:11.880 --> 07:15.080
So it's probably the
school that's best for you.

07:15.440 --> 07:18.280
What high school am
I going to if I don't
get into Newtown?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.040
No, you're getting
into Newtown.

07:20.120 --> 07:21.440
How do you know?

07:21.520 --> 07:23.040
[chuckles] 'Cause you'll
get into Newtown!

07:23.120 --> 07:25.120
I have faith in you,
you're gonna get into Newtown.

07:25.200 --> 07:27.480
Don't you need a backup plan?

07:27.560 --> 07:30.200
Even if it takes
us moving back to Newtown,

07:30.280 --> 07:32.240
you'll go to Newtown
as a local.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.000
It's all right.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.560
Mum?

08:23.080 --> 08:25.320
About AFL.

08:26.920 --> 08:30.760
I've been keeping up
quite a lot on my homework.

08:30.840 --> 08:34.000
And they're
enrolling pretty soon,
and I would like to join,

08:34.080 --> 08:36.240
and I've only got
one homework strike,

08:36.320 --> 08:38.400
that was 'cause
over the weekend.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.080
But I've learnt my lesson

08:40.159 --> 08:43.720
so now I'm doing
every single bit
of homework tonight,

08:43.799 --> 08:45.400
for all year.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.440
So when will you be doing AFL?

08:47.520 --> 08:48.960
When are the times for AFL?

08:49.040 --> 08:50.400
[Matt] Sunday.

08:50.480 --> 08:51.800
No way, mate.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.680
That's Saturday sports,
Sunday sports,

08:54.760 --> 08:56.920
we have a right to
have a weekend, too.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.560
So this is not just about you.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.400
And as a mature young man,
in year seven,

09:04.200 --> 09:07.640
your consideration shouldn't
just be for what you want.

09:07.760 --> 09:10.920
That's my time to visit God,
that's my time to talk to God.

09:11.920 --> 09:15.040
So for me, that is
very important to me.

09:16.160 --> 09:18.520
So if your game ends up
being on a Sunday morning,

09:18.600 --> 09:21.360
that means that
I'm missing church.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.560
<i>I went to Bible study</i>
<i>last Sunday,</i>

09:28.600 --> 09:32.120
<i>We just read out a passage</i>
<i>and tried to</i>

09:32.200 --> 09:34.360
<i>think of the meaning</i>
<i>of that passage.</i>

09:35.720 --> 09:39.760
<i>There's a non-believers</i>
<i>tunnel which is very wide</i>

09:39.840 --> 09:42.080
<i>and easy to go through.</i>

09:42.160 --> 09:44.320
<i>But then there's a believers</i>
<i>tunnel that is very thin</i>

09:44.400 --> 09:46.600
<i>and not so easy to go through.</i>

09:47.000 --> 09:49.680
And the reason why
the believers tunnel
is so thin

09:49.760 --> 09:52.600
is because one,
not many people choose it,

09:52.680 --> 09:56.520
and two, it's hard
to stay on that track

09:56.600 --> 09:58.320
once you've chosen it,

09:58.400 --> 10:01.360
because not all good
things in life come easy.

10:07.680 --> 10:10.080
At our age, we have
a decision now

10:10.160 --> 10:13.360
whether or not we believe
or don't believe in God.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.400

[Matt] Turn it over
and spell Tuesday.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.040
Yeah, turn it over and
spell Tuesday for me.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.120
The days of the week
thing let you down.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.080
Yeah, the days of

pretty upsetting I'd say.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.320
Okay, one, two, three.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.680
Oh, sunshine,
ray of sunshine,
arms up, careful.

13:52.360 --> 13:53.360
Go ahead.

13:56.480 --> 13:57.920
Okay, I'm gonna say
the first few names,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.200
and you have to say
their last name. John?

14:00.600 --> 14:01.960
[Rory] Michael.

14:02.040 --> 14:04.880
No, that's Sean Michaels.
What about John C, C?

14:04.960 --> 14:06.040
[Rory] Cena.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.480
Cena!

14:07.560 --> 14:09.480
And Cody?

14:12.000 --> 14:13.800
Rhodes.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.080
Cody Rhodes!

14:15.160 --> 14:19.240
Cody Rhodes!
And Triple...

14:19.400 --> 14:20.520
H!

14:20.600 --> 14:23.640
Good girl, The Un...

14:23.720 --> 14:25.000
Undertaker.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.400
Undertaker!

14:26.480 --> 14:29.120
Please don't
indoctrinate your sister
too much with wrestling.

14:29.200 --> 14:31.560
Okay, I'm thinking
of someone else.

14:31.640 --> 14:32.960
I mean it though,
Gus, really.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.240
Yeah, sure Jamie, sure.

14:35.480 --> 14:37.680
It is five minutes rule,
you need to quickly
wash your face.

14:37.760 --> 14:40.040
[Rory] What about
the one, the girl?

14:41.240 --> 14:43.080
Don't forget the
girl wrestlers, Gus.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.040
Who's gonna be the girl?

14:45.840 --> 14:46.960
[Gus] The girls?

14:47.040 --> 14:48.360
This one!

14:50.320 --> 14:51.600
I love that you're
shopping with me

14:51.680 --> 14:53.600
for your mother's
underwear, it's great.

14:53.680 --> 14:56.000
Just a bit unsexy
the whole lot of it , isn't it?

15:01.240 --> 15:02.880
[Max] Stylish!

15:08.640 --> 15:10.880
Make it look like
you're the joker.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.000
Um!

15:18.160 --> 15:19.600
Can you not do that please?

15:19.680 --> 15:20.760
[Gus] Sure.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.880
That is really not for you.

15:25.560 --> 15:27.280
[saleswoman]
Do you want a tissue?

15:27.440 --> 15:28.840
[Gus] Uh, okay then.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.280
[saleswoman] Thank you.

15:32.080 --> 15:34.680
If it's a tester,
you can wear it.

15:34.760 --> 15:38.840
You don't have to wipe it off
just 'cause you freaked her out
'cause of her gender crisis,

15:38.920 --> 15:41.120
but if it's not a tester
you can't use it them.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.480
[Gus] They are testers though.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.760
All right, we'll
just tell her it's fine

15:43.840 --> 15:45.040
you like wearing
lipstick, Gus.

15:45.120 --> 15:46.840
Just apologize
for upsetting her,

15:46.920 --> 15:48.840
but tell her it's
fine to wear lipstick.

15:49.320 --> 15:52.000
Okay, come and help me
clean that off, now.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.400
I'm thinking.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.480
It's okay, darling.

15:59.120 --> 16:01.600
Max, you all right?
I'm thinking this.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.480
What do you think about
that for your mother?

16:03.560 --> 16:04.800
Uh...

16:06.320 --> 16:08.560
Is that sexy jammas?

16:09.240 --> 16:11.240
You're in the shire,
so people don't understand

16:11.320 --> 16:14.560
that boys might like to
wear lipstick as well.
It's not that weird, really.

16:14.640 --> 16:15.720
No.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.040
Just tell her you're
practicing for Mardi Gras.

16:18.600 --> 16:20.000
I'll tell her.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.840
Nah, I don't wanna
go near her again.

16:26.440 --> 16:28.440
[car honking]

16:28.520 --> 16:30.760
[Seth] Beat the car,
beat the car!

16:37.040 --> 16:38.680
[Ebony] They called the bus.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.360
I know, but the
car broke down again.

16:40.440 --> 16:41.600
[Ebony] Again?

16:41.680 --> 16:43.160
Again.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.920
[Ebony] We didn't see
you so we started walking.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.080
Good.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.120
-[Seth] Hi, Mom.
-[Jade] Hi.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.320
[Ebony]
<i>In Power Meadow,</i>
<i>I don't know like,</i>

16:53.400 --> 16:55.440
<i>anyone who has</i>
<i>a family like mine.</i>

16:55.520 --> 16:56.720
Gotta get the
baby out of the car,

16:56.800 --> 16:58.280
and Ang has to drive
the car around for--

16:58.360 --> 17:00.480
-I gave him my number.
-Did you?

17:01.040 --> 17:02.720
You mean gave him my number.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.960
[Ebony] <i>Most of the time</i>
<i>when I meet someone,</i>

17:13.040 --> 17:15.280
I go, oh yeah my
parents are gay,
and they go, "What?"

17:15.960 --> 17:18.079
Two pea soups or one!

17:18.880 --> 17:21.040
[Ebony]
<i>Kind of looking forward</i>
<i>to going to high school,</i>

17:21.118 --> 17:22.839
<i>finally getting out</i>
<i>of Power Meadow.</i>

17:27.480 --> 17:32.280
You will be starting
your tutoring on the 9th.

17:32.840 --> 17:34.760
She wants you to
learn your song before

17:34.840 --> 17:36.920
you even go there,
so you have to have finally

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
picked a song that you
have to know your song

17:39.080 --> 17:40.440
off by heart before
you even get there,

17:40.520 --> 17:41.840
so that she can do as
much work with you.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.080
[Ebony] Off by heart?

17:43.160 --> 17:44.920
Off by heart!
'Cause the lady says
you have to know it

17:45.000 --> 17:46.400
before she can work with you.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.800
So she'll teach you some
techniques and stuff like that.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.720
Probably teach you more
breathing techniques,

17:51.800 --> 17:54.040
'cause that's what you had
a little bit of trouble with.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.600
Breathing stuff, so if you
don't want to end up going to

17:57.680 --> 18:00.600
Northmead, you're going to
have to pull your finger out,

18:00.680 --> 18:03.200
and make the effort for Newtown.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.120
Okay.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.360
[Ebony]
<i>We don't really have</i>
<i>that much money.</i>

18:10.560 --> 18:12.880
<i>'Cause neither of</i>
<i>them can work 'cause,</i>

18:12.960 --> 18:15.440
<i>mainly they have to</i>
<i>look after Ashaan who</i>

18:15.520 --> 18:17.920
<i>hasn't slept through the</i>
<i>night once in his life,</i>

18:18.000 --> 18:20.760
<i>who has epilepsy and,</i>
<i>it's just been hard.</i>

18:22.120 --> 18:24.080
[woman] How's his meds going?

18:24.680 --> 18:26.800
[sighs] He was having seizure
after seizure after seizure

18:26.880 --> 18:30.120
so we had to get in touch
with the neurologist,

18:30.200 --> 18:32.480
and they've uped the dosage.

18:32.560 --> 18:33.640
He's put on weight--

18:33.720 --> 18:34.880
You're splashing my head!

18:34.960 --> 18:36.240
And he's grown and
stuff so he needs more.

18:36.440 --> 18:38.040
You haven't been
on Facebook lately,

18:38.120 --> 18:40.000
he had two seizures
while I was carrying him

18:40.080 --> 18:41.480
in my hiking pack on my back.

18:41.560 --> 18:43.080
[Woman] Is he asleep or?

18:43.160 --> 18:44.960
Yeah, asleep,
he's always asleep.

18:50.440 --> 18:52.560
Have your medicine, good boy!

18:53.080 --> 18:54.680
Good boy!

18:55.440 --> 18:56.720
Very good.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.160
[laughs]

19:01.560 --> 19:03.480
No, he's gonna wanna touch it!

19:03.560 --> 19:05.240
Oh no, don't!

19:19.400 --> 19:22.120
[Ebony] <i>It must be a really</i>
<i>really good school for Mum</i>

19:22.200 --> 19:25.080
<i>to go to such </i>
<i>extreme measures </i>
<i>to try and get me in.</i>

19:30.080 --> 19:32.720
<i>Seth hasn't even been able</i>
<i>to go into karate lessons</i>

19:32.800 --> 19:35.080
<i>because she's been spending</i>
<i>so much money on me.</i>

19:38.400 --> 19:40.240
Makes me very grateful.

19:49.440 --> 19:52.360
Thank you Lord for the
wonderful family that we have,

19:52.440 --> 19:54.320
and the blessings that we have.

19:54.480 --> 19:56.360
For what we are
about to receive,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.280
may the Lord make
us truly thankful.

19:58.360 --> 20:00.120
[All] Amen.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.240
Bon appetit everybody!

20:02.320 --> 20:03.520
[phone ringing]

20:03.600 --> 20:05.720
[Lou] Are you serious?

20:05.840 --> 20:07.560
I'm starting!

20:11.080 --> 20:12.640
Matt, you've got porridge.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.160
So I'll take Matt
on a Thursday,

20:15.240 --> 20:17.080
you take Dylan on a Wednesday.

20:17.160 --> 20:18.720
[Matt] <i>My mom and</i>

Probably looking
at a Thursday night,

20:24.640 --> 20:26.560
'cause I've got sprinting,
long-distance throws,

20:26.640 --> 20:28.040
and high jumps.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.760
<i>I think it's when my</i>

20:35.400 --> 20:37.880
<i>Then I guess they</i>

20:37.960 --> 20:40.280
<i>it's better if</i>
<i>they got divorced,</i>

20:40.360 --> 20:44.040
<i>because they didn't want</i>
<i>Dylan and I to hear them</i>

20:46.520 --> 20:48.160
<i>My mom met Lou.</i>

20:49.760 --> 20:51.440
<i>Lou's cooked for me,</i>

20:53.240 --> 20:55.080
loved me,

20:55.160 --> 20:57.840
done so many
things for me that,

20:57.960 --> 21:00.520
I never thought that
somebody who wasn't my parent

21:00.600 --> 21:02.120
or related to me, could do.

21:02.440 --> 21:05.800
<i>I'm getting on with the job</i>

21:22.680 --> 21:24.720
<i>You know that Julia Gillard</i>
<i>said she's against it.</i>

21:24.800 --> 21:29.160
<i>Would you vote for any</i>

21:29.240 --> 21:32.560
<i>on this one issue, is that</i>
<i>important enough for you</i>

21:32.640 --> 21:33.840
<i>that it would override</i>
<i>everything else?</i>

21:33.920 --> 21:36.560
<i>Of course it is,</i>
<i>this issue's very</i>
<i>important to us,</i>

21:36.640 --> 21:40.320
<i>it's our lives.</i>
<i>And when we go to vote,</i>
<i>we'll vote for the party that</i>

21:40.400 --> 21:43.000
<i>aligns with our interests</i>
<i>and our policies,</i>

21:43.080 --> 21:45.440
<i>and the way we</i>
<i>feel about things,</i>
<i>and what's important to us.</i>

21:45.520 --> 21:46.600
Sound like me.

21:47.160 --> 21:49.920
Your accent is
a bit stronger on TV,

21:50.000 --> 21:51.120
but it's not
that much stronger.

21:51.200 --> 21:54.200
Yeah, 'cause when
I get under stress,
my accent comes off more.

21:54.280 --> 21:55.320
Oh, yah.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.200
Oh, yah.
[laughter]

21:57.720 --> 22:00.040
Is it our weekend
with you guys?
It is, isn't it?

22:00.600 --> 22:02.840
[Matt] I've got that
church thing on Sunday.

22:02.920 --> 22:05.400
[Dylan] Well, Dad will be
coming down to stay.

22:05.480 --> 22:07.600
Are you sure
that's what you want?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.800
Because I got a phone call
from Beck, she wanted to

22:09.880 --> 22:14.080
chat to you. Are you happy to
go to Bible study with her?

22:14.160 --> 22:16.040
I don't mind.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.880
Well I think, honey if
you're going to make up

22:17.960 --> 22:19.680
your mind about something,
you need to know the facts

22:19.760 --> 22:22.160
before you make
a decision, yeah?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.080
And at the moment,

22:24.160 --> 22:27.040
you're only focusing on
one thing, aren't you?

22:27.680 --> 22:29.000
What do you mean one thing?

22:29.080 --> 22:32.160
Well, you know we were talking
about it the other night,

22:32.240 --> 22:33.880
and the conclusion
we came to...

22:33.960 --> 22:35.640
[Lou] I'm gonna wash up.

22:35.720 --> 22:37.640
Okay, you go shower.

22:42.920 --> 22:45.920
For me, I was brought
up with the Bible.

22:46.040 --> 22:48.560
I listened to stories
every single day.

22:49.080 --> 22:52.160
And for me it was my favorite
storybook, I loved it.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.360
And it wasn't
just a storybook,
it took me a while

22:54.480 --> 22:57.200
to realize that this
was actually based on

22:57.280 --> 23:00.080
people's stories of things
that they actually experienced.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.800
Like how did we find
out how babies were born?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.880
How did we?

23:05.960 --> 23:07.960
From people experiencing it.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.240
But how did it
first come about?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.400
You know,
who made the world?

23:13.320 --> 23:15.360
Who made it, how did
it come into existence?

23:15.680 --> 23:17.040
Space.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.960
And how did space come about?

23:20.880 --> 23:22.520
How did it first get there?

23:23.640 --> 23:25.160
I don't know.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.760
It just was there.

23:28.600 --> 23:30.120
You are entitled to
your own beliefs,

23:30.200 --> 23:32.840
and to not believe in God
if that is what you want.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.240
But, I want you to learn
more about the Bible,

23:37.440 --> 23:39.560
and so that you have the facts.

23:39.640 --> 23:41.440

24:58.800 --> 25:02.040
My second one was
just a care one.

25:02.480 --> 25:04.480
The third one is Matt and Pete,

25:04.560 --> 25:07.240
and this is the
fourth move to Fiji.

25:18.520 --> 25:21.160
<i>When I was five,</i>
<i>I couldn't speak</i>

25:21.240 --> 25:25.480
<i>because my first</i>
<i>family didn't teach me.</i>

25:50.000 --> 25:52.880
So the boys are gonna
be here on your visa,

25:52.960 --> 25:54.680
so you're the father.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.080
[Pete] Uh-huh.

25:56.160 --> 25:59.680
So how are we explaining
me to the school?

26:02.520 --> 26:04.880
He could be our babysitter.

26:06.320 --> 26:09.080
I think that
Matt's right, guys.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.880
I think in this culture
we have to be careful about

26:11.960 --> 26:16.200
how we introduce the fact
that you have two dads.

26:17.360 --> 26:21.360
So the idea is, Matt's
and my relationship,
that's private, okay?

26:21.440 --> 26:24.520
So no one needs to
know that relationship.

26:24.640 --> 26:26.280
Like if people say,
"Oh that's your dad,

26:26.360 --> 26:30.040
who's that other guy?"
you say, "Oh he,
he's with us too."

26:30.280 --> 26:32.680
-[Graham] He's a friend.
-He helps look after us.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.480
[Pete] Woah, it is
a big tooth, Graham.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.000
[Matt] Is that a baby tooth?

26:47.080 --> 26:48.640
It is a baby tooth.

26:48.720 --> 26:49.840
Pretty cool.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.840
Can you go put it
in a glass of water?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.880
[Matt] Love you honey,
we'll see you in the morning.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.560
[birds chirping]

27:12.400 --> 27:14.200
Did you hear the
rain this morning?

27:14.280 --> 27:15.400
[Pete] Nope.

27:15.480 --> 27:16.680
[Matt] Lots of
rain this morning.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.680
[Graham] A lot of it.

27:19.400 --> 27:22.200
Boys, we have two
things planned for today.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.040
Is it generous?

27:24.120 --> 27:26.720
Generous, friend and,

27:27.680 --> 27:29.440
such good friends.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.720
Oh what's this?

27:30.800 --> 27:32.280
What is it?

27:32.360 --> 27:34.760
Oh she must have dropped
it on my bedside table.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.400
Liar!
[laughter]

27:37.480 --> 27:38.720
Liar.

27:38.800 --> 27:41.360
So wait, the tooth
fairy not only brought you

27:41.440 --> 27:43.800
one dollar Australian
instead of one dollar Fijian,

27:43.880 --> 27:46.480
she dropped the tooth
on my bedside table.

27:46.560 --> 27:48.600
[all laughing]

27:48.680 --> 27:51.720
You're the tooth fairy!
He is the tooth fairy!

27:51.800 --> 27:55.480
Okay Michael, Graham,
you don't believe,
you don't receive, okay?

27:55.560 --> 27:58.200
I can't believe the tooth
fairy dropped the tooth on

27:58.280 --> 28:00.520
my bedside table in the
middle of the night.

28:00.600 --> 28:02.520
[Matt] Well, I think she
must have gotten [mumbles].

28:03.880 --> 28:06.840
[Graham] <i>Lying is sometimes</i>
<i>good and sometimes bad.</i>

28:16.440 --> 28:20.080
<i>If someone says, "Oh have</i>
<i>you ate your lunch today?"</i>

28:20.240 --> 28:24.120
<i>And you say yes, but</i>
<i>you actually didn't,</i>
<i>that's a bad lie.</i>

28:31.440 --> 28:35.400
<i>And a good lie is,</i>
<i>oh, I have a dad and,</i>

28:35.480 --> 28:40.840
<i>he's looking after me, and</i>
<i>the other one's just a carer.</i>

28:46.880 --> 28:49.000
<i>And that's a good lie.</i>

28:54.080 --> 28:55.560
[Pete] So these are
a little tricky to

28:55.640 --> 28:58.000
get open and closed,
so you need to
make sure that you push.

28:59.920 --> 29:05.320
<i>I think it's okay to</i>
<i>lie about having two dads.</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:13.280
<i>Because Fiji is</i>
<i>not really keen on</i>

29:14.640 --> 29:16.400
<i>gay people.</i>

29:23.160 --> 29:26.000
[Matt] I don't think
you'll need your hat
in the classroom.

29:37.320 --> 29:42.200
[Class] Geoboard.
G-E-O-B-O-A-R-D.

29:42.680 --> 29:47.320
Balloons.
B-A-L-L-O-O-N-S.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.600
[children mumble]

29:49.680 --> 29:52.400
B-A-R-A-L-L-E--

29:52.480 --> 29:56.040
[Graham] <i>If you can't read,</i>
<i>the letters will be like</i>

29:56.120 --> 29:59.400
<i>A, A, B, B, </i> [mumbles]
<i>all over the page like,</i>

29:59.480 --> 30:02.440
<i>what's that, what's</i>
<i>that, what's that?</i>

30:06.200 --> 30:08.840
<i>Sometimes they don't</i>
<i>make sense for me.</i>

30:14.000 --> 30:16.360
<i>The OMG,</i>

30:16.440 --> 30:19.960
<i>oh, my God moment was</i>
<i>not what you saw.</i>

30:20.560 --> 30:23.840
<i>It was a short period</i>
<i>of time after that,</i>

30:23.920 --> 30:27.880
<i>it was when the epic match</i>
<i>between the Undertaker</i>
<i>and myself--</i>

30:27.960 --> 30:30.560
[Gus] <i>Before I liked</i>
<i>wrestling I was a little like,</i>

30:31.640 --> 30:35.680
<i>fluffy and flowery and stuff.</i>

30:37.560 --> 30:40.000
[commentator] <i>Got a little</i>
<i>too aggressive!</i>

30:42.040 --> 30:44.120
[Gus] <i>And then</i>
<i>I really liked wrestling</i>
<i>and then I became</i>

30:44.200 --> 30:48.360
<i>a little rough and tough</i>
<i>and mean.</i>

30:54.080 --> 30:55.720
Drop slam connecting!

30:58.200 --> 31:00.520
[announcer] <i>...second decade</i>
<i>of </i> SmackDown.

31:07.680 --> 31:10.920
Jesse James was then carried
out by the paramedics!

31:20.360 --> 31:22.800
Just [mumbles] cheap
so he can sit up and

31:22.880 --> 31:24.760
have the whole experience
and just be on the stools

31:24.840 --> 31:28.160
with every other kid that
can't afford bloody, you know?

31:28.240 --> 31:29.720
Really go.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.440
[grunting]

31:34.200 --> 31:36.000
[Gus] The smack down!

31:39.360 --> 31:44.080
What I'm worried about
is that the wrestling men
are such jerky men.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.320
[Gus] Hey!

31:45.400 --> 31:47.120
That they're...

31:49.280 --> 31:51.880
That they're a bit,
that they hate,
basically hate women.

31:51.960 --> 31:53.000
[Gus] What?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.280
That they're anti-gay.

31:54.360 --> 31:55.800
[Gus] No!

31:55.880 --> 31:57.840
I'm worried that you
start thinking that that's

31:57.920 --> 32:01.040
the way you be an
interesting man,

32:01.120 --> 32:03.000
or that's the way
you be a sexy man,

32:03.080 --> 32:04.680
or that's the way
you be a popular man,

32:04.760 --> 32:06.680
or something like that.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.200
I quite like rough and tumble.

32:09.280 --> 32:10.840
I think it's fun.

32:10.920 --> 32:13.200
But I have a problem
with the men doing that

32:13.280 --> 32:17.360
awful kind of thing and the
way they talk about women
as if they're--

32:17.440 --> 32:18.600
Mom, they never
talk about women!

32:18.680 --> 32:20.720
Like, they never do it.

32:20.800 --> 32:21.960
They never talk about women.

32:22.040 --> 32:25.200
But you told me there
was something where
some guy insulted some woman,

32:25.280 --> 32:27.760
and some man was going
out with her and her twin,

32:27.840 --> 32:30.920
and he came straightaway
and he flattened the guy,

32:31.000 --> 32:34.560
like he didn't, like as if
that is some kind of solution

32:34.640 --> 32:35.800
to someone being--

32:35.880 --> 32:37.160
[Gus] No no,
he talked to the guy,

32:37.240 --> 32:40.280
and the guy wouldn't stop
and the guy just slapped him,

32:40.360 --> 32:42.720
and then he flattened the guy.

32:42.800 --> 32:45.400
Well, doesn't
sound great, does it?

32:45.480 --> 32:48.320
He just slapped him
and then he flattened him.

32:48.400 --> 32:49.760
That was one
thing that happened.

32:49.840 --> 32:53.320
That is not, nothing
like that has ever
happened ever before.

32:53.400 --> 32:55.280
But baby there's nothing
that ever happens on it

32:55.360 --> 32:58.320
that's about peace
or about friendship,

32:58.400 --> 32:59.960
or about caring
for other people--

33:00.040 --> 33:02.640
-There's heaps of friendship
and there's heaps of caring!
-Or about democracy.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.160
I don't know what
mocka-cy is but--

33:04.240 --> 33:06.200
Democracy, it's where,
it's where,

33:06.280 --> 33:08.800
people sit down and they talk
about what everybody wants,

33:08.880 --> 33:10.840
and they work problems
out by talking.

33:10.920 --> 33:12.520
[Gus] What?

33:12.600 --> 33:13.880
Democracy.

33:13.960 --> 33:15.560
[Gus] No, there's
no democracy.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.720
No there's no democracy,
it's all about flattening people

33:17.800 --> 33:19.360
and just smashing
their heads in.

33:19.440 --> 33:20.880
No!

33:20.960 --> 33:22.720
What about tag-team matches?

33:23.320 --> 33:25.120
They're friends!

33:25.560 --> 33:27.160
What about contract signing?

33:27.880 --> 33:29.840
They sit down and talk.

33:31.560 --> 33:33.280
[sighing]

33:45.200 --> 33:49.560
[Sandy] It is your job to
argue and raise questions,
it is his job to listen.

33:52.560 --> 33:55.240
[Matt] <i>My mom basically</i>
<i>wants me to have a meeting</i>

33:55.320 --> 33:59.080
<i>with the pastor, to have</i>
<i>a little chat about God.</i>

34:03.040 --> 34:06.520
<i>I just think </i>
<i>that the meeting's</i>
<i>gonna be a bit strange.</i>

34:11.000 --> 34:13.679
<i>I'm talking to people</i>
<i>that have believed in God</i>

34:13.760 --> 34:16.800
<i>since they were</i>
<i>like five years old.</i>

34:21.280 --> 34:24.880
<i>It's almost like</i>
<i>telling a child</i>
<i>that Santa's not real.</i>

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
So you don't really
believe in God?

34:29.080 --> 34:30.360
[Matt] No.

34:31.280 --> 34:34.159
What are the things that
make you disbelieve God?

34:36.040 --> 34:38.960
Well, they've just
written this book where

34:40.040 --> 34:43.960
everything is perfect
and this is how

34:44.040 --> 34:46.120
they think everything
should live,

34:46.199 --> 34:49.960
and that if you follow this
then you have to live like this,

34:50.040 --> 34:53.120
you can't marry
someone that's not...

34:53.199 --> 34:55.520
You can't marry the same sex,

34:55.600 --> 34:58.080
and all that kind of stuff.

35:00.720 --> 35:03.200
The issue under that
in your life for you,

35:03.280 --> 35:07.520
is the question about, oh,
well who's to say that,

35:07.600 --> 35:10.400
you know, who should marry
who, and things like that?

35:10.480 --> 35:12.120
That's the big question?

35:13.160 --> 35:14.520
[Matt] Yeah.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.720
Yeah, that's really great.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.560
With your mom and Lou
that we can say look,

35:19.640 --> 35:22.160
we really think the
Bible says this,

35:22.240 --> 35:25.000
but we love you,
and love you to be here,

35:25.080 --> 35:26.800
which you know is true.

35:26.880 --> 35:29.120
So it's not always easy,
because we really do disagree

35:29.200 --> 35:32.280
on something that's
very, very, very important
to both of us.

35:33.720 --> 35:36.280
Were you worried
I'd be embarrassed if
you asked that question?

35:36.360 --> 35:37.720
-[Matt] No.
-Really?

35:39.160 --> 35:41.480
It's a gutsy question.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.280
Any question I like, all
questions are good questions.

35:55.840 --> 35:57.440
Why do you go to a church

35:58.200 --> 36:01.560
where everyone thinks that
you're a sin against God?

36:01.640 --> 36:03.560
When you could just
go to a church where

36:03.640 --> 36:05.600
everyone thinks
that you're normal?

36:09.440 --> 36:12.720
For me, it's not
about what people think.

36:12.800 --> 36:16.320
It's what I believe
my God believes,

36:16.400 --> 36:18.240
and what he thinks about us.

36:19.800 --> 36:22.680
You think that we should
go to a different church?

36:22.760 --> 36:25.320
-No, I'm just--
-Where we're accepted?

36:25.400 --> 36:30.360
No, I'm just curious
why you chose this church,
instead of another one.

36:31.240 --> 36:34.080
Has your disbelief
in God got anything to do

36:34.160 --> 36:37.720
with the fact that Lou and
mommy are in a relationship,

36:37.800 --> 36:40.480
and that that is a sin against
God, as the Bible says?

36:40.560 --> 36:43.320
That's a bit of it.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.040
[Sandy] Okay.

36:55.800 --> 36:57.560
[Teacher] All right,
I'm just gonna be
another 10 minutes,

36:57.640 --> 36:59.080
'cause I'm still with
my other student.

36:59.160 --> 37:02.120
Sorry, I don't really have
anywhere for you to sit,
so just give me a sec.

37:07.120 --> 37:10.240
[Ebony] <i>When I first found</i>
<i>out my mums were gay,</i>

37:11.280 --> 37:14.560
and they were going on like,
together together and stuff,

37:14.640 --> 37:17.000
I was kind of, I don't know,

37:17.120 --> 37:18.840
I wasn't that
accepting at first.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.680
You always look so
short in those pants.

37:30.200 --> 37:31.520
I was the kind of
person who would go,

37:31.600 --> 37:34.480
"Haha, you're gay,
you suck, you're gay."

37:34.560 --> 37:35.880
Who would make jokes about it.

37:41.720 --> 37:43.800
[Ang] What are you doing?
Leave her alone.

37:43.880 --> 37:45.160
[Jade] I'm doing her socks up!

37:45.240 --> 37:47.880
[Ebony] <i>People would</i>
<i>slowly find out and,</i>

37:47.960 --> 37:50.880
<i>I'd just kinda be like,</i>
<i>"Yeah" and kinda run off.</i>

37:53.560 --> 37:55.280
[laughter]

37:55.880 --> 37:58.920
It's not normal,
you're not normal,
and stuff,

37:59.000 --> 38:01.560
the kind of things
that would go around
my head at the time.

38:01.720 --> 38:03.800
[all laughing]

38:07.880 --> 38:10.240
[Jade] See now that
we've actually stopped.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.560
-Hello again.
-[Ebony] Hi.

38:12.640 --> 38:14.520
[Teacher] It's gonna be a
very crowded room tonight.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.320
We might just, I just wanna
sit here a little bit and then

38:17.400 --> 38:19.400
we'll give you the space.

38:19.480 --> 38:21.000
Do you wanna have
a sing through it?

38:21.080 --> 38:22.400
Are you warmed up
and ready to go?

38:22.480 --> 38:24.320
Have you done any
singing this afternoon?

38:24.400 --> 38:25.520
[Ebony] Not today.

38:25.600 --> 38:27.720
Not today, all right,
let's do a little
bit of singing today.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.240
Might need to get rid
of the chewing gum,

38:29.320 --> 38:31.000
there's tissue up top
on the shelf there.

38:31.360 --> 38:32.800
All right, so are you
guys both staying,

38:32.880 --> 38:34.600
or are you gonna
give her some space?

38:34.680 --> 38:36.360
[Jade] We wanna
listen to her sing.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.320
[Teacher] Oh you wanna
have a listen to her first.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.560
All right, no worries.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.440
I'll listen and then I'll go.

38:43.160 --> 38:46.000
[Teacher] I think it's
gonna be too short, obviously.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.800
What about if we look at,

38:52.880 --> 38:54.520
let's get that out for a second.

38:54.600 --> 38:57.000
Let's time this, yeah?

38:59.280 --> 39:01.840
When you're singing at home,
how much louder is it?

39:03.040 --> 39:04.320
Quite a bit louder.

39:04.400 --> 39:06.400
[teacher chuckles]
Quite a bit louder, is it?

39:06.480 --> 39:09.480
And so do you think maybe
we could have a crack at

39:09.560 --> 39:12.240
trying to get it to be quite
a bit louder in here as well?

39:12.320 --> 39:13.320
Maybe.

39:13.400 --> 39:14.800
We'll have a go of it.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.640

40:02.520 --> 40:04.600
<i>I'm scared </i>

40:11.120 --> 40:13.240
[Jade] Ebony,
come here, Ebony!

40:13.720 --> 40:15.320
Have a practice song!

40:21.520 --> 40:23.000
-Please?
-[Ebony] No.

40:23.080 --> 40:24.960
[Jade] You need
to practice, go on!

40:28.280 --> 40:30.040
You need to get
over your nerves.

40:31.080 --> 40:33.120
Practice what you're gonna
do for your audition.

40:36.000 --> 40:37.680
She's afraid of
everybody laughing.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.120
No one's gonna laugh.

40:39.200 --> 40:40.600
Just your little brother.

40:41.080 --> 40:44.040
I'll put a hand over his
mouth and you'll be fine.

40:45.600 --> 40:47.000
I don't wanna do it.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.280
[Jade] Why?

40:52.400 --> 40:53.920
That's ridiculous.

40:54.280 --> 40:55.640
Go on, please?

40:55.720 --> 40:58.160
[Ang] Just go and brush your
teeth and go hop into bed.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.600
[Jade] Off you go.

41:00.760 --> 41:02.200
[Ang] 'Night chicken.

41:02.280 --> 41:04.800
-[Ebony] Night!
-Go upstairs, go
brush your teeth.

41:06.520 --> 41:08.920
She needs to build up
some more confidence,

41:09.000 --> 41:11.160
and do things that make
her feel uncomfortable.

41:11.440 --> 41:14.920
She chucked tantrums
at her teachers,

41:15.000 --> 41:17.760
and stood there at
Riverside Theater,

41:17.840 --> 41:19.400
where she's performing
in a combined choir,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.200
with her arms crossed
looking pissed off,

41:21.280 --> 41:23.160
'cause she didn't
wanna sing a song.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.360
Not because she
didn't wanna sing,

41:25.440 --> 41:26.840
but because she
didn't like the song.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.280
She needs to be pushed
to do things that

41:28.360 --> 41:30.080
make her feel a little
bit uncomfortable.

[Ashaan crying]

41:56.080 --> 41:57.240
What's wrong with him?

41:58.760 --> 41:59.920
What happened?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.640
[Jade] He's just
had a seizure.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.640
It's okay!

42:08.720 --> 42:11.200
Your sissy's got you!

42:11.880 --> 42:13.840
Sissy's got you.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.320
It's all right,
go do your practice.

42:39.400 --> 42:41.920
Go do your practice,
it's all right.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.160
Guh, ih, ihd.

42:45.240 --> 42:47.440
Okay Graham, honey.

42:48.080 --> 42:49.240
What are our three rules?

42:49.320 --> 42:52.080
Slow down, don't guess, read
until the end of the word.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.720
Right, what's the
last letter there at
the end of the word then?

42:55.440 --> 42:56.960
Is it a "D"?

42:57.040 --> 42:58.840
Deh, it.

42:59.480 --> 43:01.120
Graham, the word is diet.

43:01.200 --> 43:02.640
Diet, his diet--

43:02.720 --> 43:04.640
It's not his at all,
it's this.

43:04.720 --> 43:06.520
This diet gave him--

43:06.600 --> 43:07.880
Slow, stop.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.880
Start at this beginning,
slow down, and don't guess.

43:10.960 --> 43:11.800
His--

43:11.880 --> 43:13.320
It's not his honey,
it's this.

43:14.480 --> 43:17.240
This diet gave him a

43:17.800 --> 43:20.160
tuh, tummy,

43:20.600 --> 43:24.600
ache and a breath,

43:25.800 --> 43:27.360
tem-puhr.

43:27.520 --> 43:29.880
So his diet gave
him a beastly temper.

43:30.240 --> 43:32.280
All right?
Let's keep going.

43:32.360 --> 43:35.000
Just, okay my thoughts are,

43:35.080 --> 43:38.280
to start inquiring about the
resources that we might need.

43:38.360 --> 43:41.400
And if that's a
teacher that's retired,

43:41.480 --> 43:43.640
or a young teacher
at the university, or...

43:43.720 --> 43:45.880
-Yeah.
-Someone.

43:45.960 --> 43:48.600
Someone who's studying teaching,

43:48.680 --> 43:49.920
someone who's studying
speech therapy,

43:50.000 --> 43:52.520
someone who's studying,
learning, whatever.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.440
And we just need to let
them know that he just

43:55.520 --> 43:59.400
couldn't speak, when he
came to live with us,

43:59.480 --> 44:02.800
that all he had were vowel
sounds, and hand signals.

44:04.080 --> 44:06.680
But it's important that
they know that that's,

44:06.760 --> 44:10.760
like that it was that extreme,
and he's done so well,

44:10.840 --> 44:13.840
but that he really
was at this like,

44:13.920 --> 44:16.880
real disadvantage without
being able to speak at

44:18.360 --> 44:20.000
age five or whatever.

44:20.760 --> 44:22.520
[teacher] Okay,
get ready for the test.

44:22.600 --> 44:24.160
I will say the word.

44:27.880 --> 44:32.360
They proudly sang
their song, proudly.

44:33.760 --> 44:37.400
Laughing, they were
laughing at you.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.200
Laughing.

44:58.640 --> 45:00.520
You have to talk
to my teacher.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.840
Yeah.

45:02.080 --> 45:03.920
-Who's the taxi?
-[Matt] How's school?

45:04.000 --> 45:05.320
Good.

45:06.720 --> 45:10.520
[Graham]
<i>When I saw my test score,</i>
<i>I was a bit sad because,</i>

45:11.520 --> 45:13.200
<i>it was a bit low.</i>

45:17.520 --> 45:20.480
I got like five, no.

45:21.880 --> 45:23.560
Four wrong, that's all.

45:24.000 --> 45:25.480
You got four wrong out of six?

45:25.560 --> 45:26.640
Yeah.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.760
That's a lot.

45:27.840 --> 45:29.240
I know that is, but--

45:29.320 --> 45:31.120
What was the,
what subject was it?

45:31.200 --> 45:34.480
It was, it's like,

45:34.560 --> 45:36.680
you read it, then
you answer questions,

45:36.760 --> 45:37.880
it's like those books.

45:37.960 --> 45:39.680
-Reading comprehension?
-Yeah.

45:41.480 --> 45:43.440
And do you, you just
have to fill in a word?

45:43.520 --> 45:44.520
Or do you have to
write sentences?

45:44.600 --> 45:46.320
Sentences, and I...

45:47.320 --> 45:48.920
Okay so it sounds like.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.160
I only got like, two correct.

45:51.240 --> 45:53.040
Yeah so it sounds
like that's really

45:53.120 --> 45:54.440
a hard thing for
you, is that right?

45:54.520 --> 45:55.840
Mm-hmm.

45:57.400 --> 46:00.600
It doesn't care Dad,
it's not that much.

46:01.000 --> 46:03.520
Okay, what about the
other kids in your class?

46:03.600 --> 46:05.520
Is it a hard thing for
them, do you reckon?

46:05.600 --> 46:07.520
No, I don't know.

46:08.160 --> 46:10.880
Cause we had to
do it secretly.

46:10.960 --> 46:12.320
You don't know how
the other kids scored?

46:12.400 --> 46:14.440
No one got the top mark, no.

46:14.520 --> 46:16.640
Do you know how the
other kids scored?

46:17.440 --> 46:20.360
[Graham] Miss said,
"Put your hand up if you know,

46:21.600 --> 46:23.160
"if I say your score".

46:25.720 --> 46:27.320
So were you the
lowest one in the class?

46:27.400 --> 46:28.840
Yeah, kind of.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.440
More than kind of, like yes.

46:30.520 --> 46:31.840
Yeah.

46:42.600 --> 46:44.040
[Matt] The right level?

46:44.120 --> 46:45.360
[teacher speaking]

47:20.200 --> 47:22.360
So before that it really--

48:03.320 --> 48:05.640
I like that.
Graham likes that as well.

48:14.360 --> 48:16.920
[Matt] <i>The first time we</i>
<i>found out about our Mum</i>

48:17.000 --> 48:19.360
<i>having dinner with</i>
<i>Julia Gillard,</i>

48:20.560 --> 48:23.120
<i>she'll only have it</i>
<i>if I'm okay with it,</i>

48:23.200 --> 48:25.480
<i>'cause I'm going to a Catholic</i>
<i>high school next year.</i>

48:29.000 --> 48:30.840
<i>And the first thing</i>
<i>I said was,</i>

48:30.920 --> 48:34.720
<i>"Mum, there's nearly</i>
<i>5,000 kids in Waverly,</i>

48:34.800 --> 48:38.200
<i>and not all 5,000</i>
<i>can bully me.</i>

48:38.280 --> 48:41.680
<i>There will only be</i>
<i>about, hopefully none."</i>

48:44.720 --> 48:48.480
<i>Kids sometimes can come up</i>
<i>with better ideas than adults.</i>

48:49.360 --> 48:51.640
They discriminate against
my family, myself,

48:51.720 --> 48:53.520
and all other gay
families in Australia.

48:53.600 --> 48:55.200
Does that make sense?

48:56.320 --> 49:00.400
[Matt] <i> I think that </i>
<i>one of mine or Dyl's ideas</i>
<i>are gonna really</i>

49:00.480 --> 49:02.120
<i>move the Prime Minister.</i>

49:02.200 --> 49:04.080
Our government has amended--

49:04.720 --> 49:08.200
[Matt] And maybe even
make gay marriage legal.

<i>Make sure that all the</i>

<i>that we don't get hurt.</i>

49:30.800 --> 49:33.680
<i>And that Matthew</i>

<i>that he's looking for.</i>

49:46.520 --> 49:47.560
[camera clicks]

49:47.640 --> 49:49.080

-Thanks.

I bought this
cross when Pop died.

50:30.840 --> 50:32.480
I know.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.760
So Pop's coming to the Prime
Minister's office with me.

50:34.840 --> 50:36.040
He'd like that.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.880
-Are you ready?
-Mm-hm.

50:37.960 --> 50:39.040
Sure?

50:39.120 --> 50:40.360
I've got my
phone in my pocket.

50:40.440 --> 50:42.400
-Do you know I love you?
-Mm-hm.

50:42.480 --> 50:44.520
I sent Dad a text
and he wished me luck.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.080
[Matt] No, not at all.

<i>In.</i>

51:32.480 --> 51:34.080

51:37.160 --> 51:40.600
It's just his seizures
were so violent last night
that he had to be held down.

51:43.600 --> 51:47.320
Well, since I talked to
you last and we increased
the medicine,

51:47.400 --> 51:50.640
actually his seizures
have gotten worse,

51:50.720 --> 51:54.200
and last night he had the
worst ones that he's had.

51:54.280 --> 51:56.280
And they were so violent that,

51:56.920 --> 52:01.920
our 12-year-old was holding
him to stop him from
throwing himself off...

52:02.880 --> 52:04.200
Yup.

52:05.120 --> 52:07.160
Okay thanks, bye.

52:08.720 --> 52:10.200
He's gotta get admitted.

52:11.840 --> 52:13.960
And he's gotta stay
admitted so they can get him

52:14.040 --> 52:16.600
in to do a scan, they're
changing his medication.

52:17.200 --> 52:20.920
'Cause it's probably
his medication
making things worse.

52:21.280 --> 52:22.680
And...

52:24.200 --> 52:25.520
Yeah.

52:27.320 --> 52:28.600
So I don't know how we're...

52:28.680 --> 52:31.000
We'll have to just go in
or he's being admitted?

52:31.080 --> 52:33.720
He's being admitted while
they change his medication,

52:33.800 --> 52:36.080
'cause they can't
take him off Tegretol

52:36.160 --> 52:40.000
without him being
admitted because he'll
have more seizures.

52:40.560 --> 52:44.640
So he's, I'll go pack
some stuff and...

52:55.480 --> 52:57.440
I'm sorry, Mum, I should
have timed it exactly.

52:57.520 --> 52:59.280
[Jade] No, no, no.

52:59.360 --> 53:01.120
It's not your fault.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.480
[sniffling]

53:16.640 --> 53:18.560
[sniffling]

53:29.560 --> 53:31.600
[Rory crying]

53:32.040 --> 53:34.800
-Stop, stop, you're
all right, stop.
-[crying loudly]

53:34.880 --> 53:36.680
Listen, sit down.

53:36.760 --> 53:38.600
Sit down, no, sit down,

53:38.680 --> 53:41.240
don't piss me off by not
looking at me with respect,

53:41.320 --> 53:44.280
you know you're making that
funny eye thing and grinning.

53:44.360 --> 53:46.280
Now listen both of you.

53:46.360 --> 53:48.000
[shushing]

53:48.080 --> 53:50.400
Listen, sit up okay?

53:50.480 --> 53:52.600
This involves you, too,
look at me.

53:52.680 --> 53:54.480
Okay, is that where the
piano was getting you.

53:54.560 --> 53:57.760
Okay, I'm putting a ban on you
wrestling with your sister,

53:57.840 --> 53:59.440
and Rory,
I'm putting a ban...

53:59.520 --> 54:01.520
Listen, no, I'm not
finished, okay?

54:01.600 --> 54:04.000
This is not the
first time, okay?

54:04.080 --> 54:06.360
She's the one that
always ends up crying.

54:06.440 --> 54:08.880
I'm not saying it's always
you trying to hurt her.

54:08.960 --> 54:12.880
I'm just saying Gus,
that you wrestle her like
you wrestle your friends,

54:12.960 --> 54:16.720
and I know she's quite strong,
but you're much bigger,
you're much stronger,

54:16.800 --> 54:18.720
and you're much
more skillful at it.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.400
Sit down, or go to bed!

54:20.480 --> 54:22.960
-I will go to bed!
-Okay, good night, okay?

54:23.040 --> 54:25.200
Jen, Gus is going to
bed for the night.

54:25.280 --> 54:27.360
No, I'm saying enough, okay?

54:27.440 --> 54:29.680
Now listen, no more
wrestling with your brother,

54:29.760 --> 54:31.480
don't you make him wrestle you.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.440
Do you understand?

54:33.520 --> 54:34.960
Don't you make him wrestle you,

54:35.040 --> 54:37.840
I don't want you to be hurt,
I don't want you to hurt him,

54:37.920 --> 54:40.720
you're too rough with
it, okay, both of you.

54:40.800 --> 54:42.480
And it's not okay anymore.

54:42.560 --> 54:44.040
Okay, do you understand mum?

54:44.120 --> 54:45.720
-[wailing]
-Do you understand me?

54:47.200 --> 54:50.760
Every day, every day I have
to stop you being hurt,
because you wrestle.

54:50.840 --> 54:52.200
[Rory whimpers]

54:52.280 --> 54:53.680
Okay?

55:01.760 --> 55:05.640
Okay Gus, I'm just
reiterating that there is
a wrestling ban.

55:06.080 --> 55:09.800
There is a wrestling
ban in this house
on you and your sister.

55:10.200 --> 55:14.000
Don't you silence me son,
or you'll bloody be
grounded for a week, okay?

55:14.080 --> 55:15.840
Put your head out
there and look at me

55:15.920 --> 55:17.360
so I can tell you
what's going on.

55:17.440 --> 55:18.880
[Gus] Tell me now.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.200
I'm saying that it's
a ban on wrestling

55:21.280 --> 55:22.640
between you and your sister.

55:22.720 --> 55:23.760
[Gus] You already
told me that.

55:23.840 --> 55:25.440
-Okay, do you understand it?
-[Gus] Yes!

55:25.520 --> 55:27.160
-Is that clear?
-[Gus] Yes!

55:27.240 --> 55:28.440
-Will you abide by that?
-[Gus] Yes!

55:28.520 --> 55:29.880
Right, now come and
do your piano practice.

55:29.960 --> 55:30.920
[Gus] Really, no!

55:31.000 --> 55:33.560
-Okay, then you stay there
and go to bed for the night.
-[Gus] Fine!

55:33.640 --> 55:34.920
[Jamie] Go and
clean your teeth then.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.160
[Gus] I'm reading,
I wanna read!

55:37.240 --> 55:39.200
[Jamie] Don't speak
to me like that, Gus!

55:39.280 --> 55:40.400
[Gus] I'll clean
my teeth later!

55:40.480 --> 55:41.800
Do not talk over
the top of me, okay?

55:41.880 --> 55:45.120
I am angry,
I get upset every day.

55:45.200 --> 55:48.560
I have to adjudicate
this rumbling!
Now I know you don't mean it.

55:49.160 --> 55:51.160
Okay, but you're too big.

55:51.240 --> 55:52.600
You're too big to
wrestle with her,

55:52.680 --> 55:54.440
unless you can do
it in a playful way,

55:54.520 --> 55:56.240
where you're very very careful,

55:56.320 --> 55:58.320
it's not gonna
happen anymore, okay?

55:58.840 --> 56:01.280
So over and out with
the bloody wrestling.

56:05.680 --> 56:07.280
Jen, do you have an
opinion on that or what?

56:07.360 --> 56:08.800
Am I overreacting or what?

56:08.880 --> 56:11.280
I'm sick of it, you know,
someone's gonna break something.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.440
It would be good if you
actually contributed

56:13.520 --> 56:15.760
to the conversation slightly.

56:15.840 --> 56:18.280
Okay, I agree with you.

56:18.800 --> 56:21.200
It's true, it's too rough.

56:22.800 --> 56:26.360
Rory needs to stop because
she also talks Gus into--

56:26.440 --> 56:28.440
[Jamie] No, I know she does!

56:29.080 --> 56:32.160
I'm saying to her, enough,
enough from everybody!

56:40.880 --> 56:42.120
[Gus] Rory!

56:42.200 --> 56:43.960
-What?
-What do you want?

56:51.680 --> 56:53.000
Yeah?

57:06.440 --> 57:08.160
[Ang] Stay here
and behave yourself.

57:08.240 --> 57:10.200
-Okay.
-Behave self.

57:10.280 --> 57:11.560
[Ang] Bee-hive.

57:11.640 --> 57:12.920
Bee-hive.

57:13.000 --> 57:14.840
[medical equipment beeping]

57:30.920 --> 57:33.520
He's on the emergency
list till Monday.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.760
But if there's an accident or,

57:37.840 --> 57:40.720
someone with a bigger emergency,

57:40.800 --> 57:43.480
then he'll get
bumped to Tuesday.

57:43.560 --> 57:48.520
But they're
keeping him in 'til,
'til he has his MRI.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.920
[Ebony]
<i>Mum doesn't cry often,</i>

58:03.000 --> 58:04.040
<i>but she got me worried.</i>

58:08.440 --> 58:10.040
<i>One or two of the</i>
<i>doctors are saying that</i>

58:10.120 --> 58:12.160
<i>it might not be</i>
<i>epilepsy because of,</i>

58:12.240 --> 58:15.040
<i>because he's too intelligent,</i>
<i>he's right-handed</i>

58:15.120 --> 58:17.160
<i>instead of left-handed and...</i>

58:19.640 --> 58:23.160
<i>The only thing that really</i>
<i>fits in with the epilepsy</i>
<i>is that he's having seizures.</i>

58:33.160 --> 58:34.600
[Jamie] Do we have
a family agreement

58:34.680 --> 58:36.280
to look after each
other differently?

58:37.040 --> 58:38.360
-Yeah?
-[Rory] No wrestling.

58:38.440 --> 58:39.880
No wrestling?

58:39.960 --> 58:41.280
Okay, she's in.

58:41.680 --> 58:44.120
I don't think anyone,
I don't think Rory and Gus,

58:44.200 --> 58:46.320
are committed to no wrestling.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.760
Am I right or wrong?

58:47.840 --> 58:49.560
I think rumbling
is really nice,

58:49.640 --> 58:52.600
but Gus gets her in headlocks,
which I constantly worry about.

58:52.680 --> 58:56.520
Rory is constantly
attacking him,
and wanting to wrestle.

58:56.600 --> 58:59.280
I think it's really hard to
have an absolute blanket rule.

58:59.360 --> 59:02.760
I think what we want
is smaller rules like,

59:03.360 --> 59:04.840
no arms around the head.

59:05.640 --> 59:07.920
Doing absolutely nothing
like picking her up

59:08.000 --> 59:10.240
where she can put her
weight on her neck.

59:11.280 --> 59:14.840
No punching,
no punching, just hitting.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.520
[Gus] No weapons.

59:17.160 --> 59:19.440
[Jane] No punching's good.

59:19.520 --> 59:22.680
No punching, just hitting.
That's not a great rule.

59:22.760 --> 59:24.480
You shouldn't punch
or hit anyway.

59:24.560 --> 59:25.800
Like this.

59:25.880 --> 59:27.960
What about tickling instead
of hitting or punching?

59:28.640 --> 59:31.560
So Gus, what are the
rules for you now?

59:31.640 --> 59:34.000
I'm not allowed to have
my hand around her neck.

59:35.080 --> 59:36.440
[Jamie] Absolutely not.

59:37.240 --> 59:38.360
[Jen] And?

59:38.440 --> 59:41.280
And I'm not allowed
to put her on her head.

59:41.480 --> 59:45.800
I've got a great rule.
No pinching.

59:46.560 --> 59:48.480
Yeah well you wouldn't
pinch anyway, would you?

59:48.560 --> 59:49.840
[Gus] Rory you're the one--

59:49.920 --> 59:52.520
[Jane] No, Rory does pinch,
so let her add her rules

59:52.600 --> 59:55.680
to the list, so no pinching,
that's a good rule.

59:55.760 --> 59:58.560
Do you know when you play
with your big brother--

59:58.640 --> 59:59.760
[Rory] No kicking.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:01.360
And when you play
with your little sister,

01:00:01.440 --> 01:00:05.760
it's gotta be fun, and fair,
and kind to each other, okay?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.400
The biggest person has
to take responsibility.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.560
[Jamie] Yeah, which is why
I get frustrated with you Gus.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.320
For the littlest
person getting hurt.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:32.520
we'll sit, we'll be
prepared to listen

01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.520
to each and every
one to stand here,

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:37.440
and read about what
you've written.

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.680
[Matt] Don't you
wanna do homework?

01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.080
Yeah.

01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:12.800
Dad and I are
desperate for you to be

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.960
the best kid that you can be,

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.920
and the best student
that you can be.

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.840
We think that you are
a clever, smart boy,

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:25.560
when he tries hard,
he gets great results.

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.160
All right, come on?

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.480
[Graham] You don't remember,
I have a desk in there.

01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:33.600
[Matt] You do,
but you go in there.

01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.840
And if you wanted to
really be pedantic,

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.640
which means give
a lot of detail--

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:38.960
No way.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.840
[Matt] You could say things
like, I have hazel eyes--

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.160
I have two dads.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:44.000
[Matt] And I am this
tall and I weigh this much.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.640
And I have two dads.

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:48.640
[Matt] Well you could say that.
Do you want to say that?

01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:50.480
Sort of but--

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.920
That's all right.

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.640
You don't need to
tell people anything

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:55.720
that they don't need
to know, all right?

01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:58.560
It's called a need-to-know
basis, Graham.

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.960
And this is important
for you to understand.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:04.000
There are things
that are appropriate

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.240
to tell people
at particular times.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:09.800
And sometimes that's
age appropriate.

01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:11.920
All right, like when
we were foster carers,

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:16.480
there were certain things that
we knew about your history

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.840
that we were not, that we,

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:22.040
did not discuss with
you because it wasn't--

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.400
A lot of them.

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.840
It wasn't age appropriate.

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:26.240
But we've discussed
everything with you

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:27.640
at the appropriate ages.

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:29.440
And there'll be things
that we discuss with you

01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:31.520
when you're 18,
that perhaps we haven't

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:33.600
discussed with you
up to that point.

01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.680
So do you see what I'm saying?

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.800
Like there's certain things
that are important to tell,

01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.640
and there's certain things
that are not important to tell.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.200
Yes, let's start writing.

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.160
-All right.
-What about me?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:45.400
Name.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.600
[soft music]

01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.960
[Matt] Good.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:55.960
Funny.

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.600
That's beautiful handwriting.

01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:10.560
Oh, is O, and uh is U.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.720
So it's I, right?

01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.560
No, not eh, listen again, ih.

01:08:20.479 --> 01:08:21.600
Her.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.080
-E-R.
-Yes.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:31.800
Put your head up, please.

01:08:37.479 --> 01:08:39.279
These are some adverbs.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.680
[Matt] It's not
adverbs, Graham.

01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.240
The word is adjectives,
you chose that word.

01:08:45.880 --> 01:08:47.520
[Graham] These are
some adjectives...

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.680
Oscar would never
get any peace,

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.399
wait, who's that?

01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.800
They're in bed.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.720
Yay.

01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.120
You're looking at a screen.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:10.560
Pool.

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:13.960
Pull-ull or swim pull?

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.200
-Swim pool.
-That's what I figured.

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.240
Now.

01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:48.080
Did you do your
writing homework?

01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:49.760
[Class] Yes!

01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:53.279
All about me, okay?

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.200
You should have enjoyed that
time writing about yourself.

01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:02.240
Let me give the honor
for the very first person
to come here.

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:05.280
It will be Graham.

01:10:05.360 --> 01:10:07.240
[applause]

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:18.320
Hello class and teacher.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.280
[All] Hello, Graham.

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.760
My name is Graham
and I'm 12 years old.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.320
I am funny, bouncy,
excitable, happy, friendly.

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.400
[mutters]

01:10:43.520 --> 01:10:45.080
[laughter]

01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:49.360
My favorite sport is soccer,
the first time I played soccer
was six years ago.

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:52.480
My team was in Sydney,
the Red Devils.

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.680
I told you I was evil.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.400
[laughter]

01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:59.320
I wish I had a dog in Suva
because it will protect me.

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:04.480
And I would care
for it and feed it,

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:07.040
and wash it and play with it.

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.080
It will be called "Destroyer".

01:11:11.120 --> 01:11:12.800
[laughter]

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:16.680
The favorite part of my life
is playing on computers,

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.720
Wii, X-Box, and iPad.

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:24.120
My favorite game is
Minecraft and Terraria.

01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:29.000
Thank you for listening,
class and teachers,

01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.960
I'm happy to live in Fiji.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.720
[applause]

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.280
I love you so much!

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.400
Well done.

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:53.880
[Matt] Have a nice night.

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.000
-[Man] How was that?
-[Matt] It was good.

01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.040
-[Dylan] Awesome.
-[Man] Yeah, feeling good?

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:03.040
-[female reporter] So did
you think she was nice?
-Yeah, really nice.

01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:06.040
Well, when I first saw her,
I stuttered a bit,

01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:08.760
so I didn't say what I
was actually going to say.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.400
So I just said,
"Hi, I'm Matthew,"

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.240
and then we gave her her
letter, and the flowers,

01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:18.520
and the chocolate, and she
said thank you, and yeah.

01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:21.240
What I wanted to say
to her at the start,

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.760
after I greeted her,
I wanted to say,

01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:25.880
that to tell you the
truth Miss Gillard,

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:28.760
I'm really honored to be here,
but then again I don't,

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:31.680
I think it's pretty stupid
to be here right now because

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:35.840
this argument, this debate,
shouldn't have even been

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:38.000
started out,
it should have just been,

01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:41.040
it shouldn't have been
a law that two people

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.600
that are in a same-sex
relationship can't get,
can't get married.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.040
-[man] Thanks, boys.
-Thank you very much.

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:51.040
[Sandy] He's just growing
up too fast at the moment.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.640
His funny little habits,
like he wouldn't undress

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.520
and give me his dirty clothes
to put in the laundry.

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.080
I had to leave the room.

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:58.520
He's 12!

01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.760
[Sandy] He's just
gone past that stage,

01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:01.840
I know but he's just
growing up too fast!

01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:06.240
[Lou] He's 12, you don't get
naked in front of your mum!

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.720
Yeah, but I just thought
we had a few more years,

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:11.120
15 at least before
we got to that stage.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.240
What's he gonna be
like in year 12?

01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:17.640
[Lou] Hairy.

01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.200
[laughter]

01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:38.720
[Graham] <i>There are definitely</i>
<i>a few things that we</i>
<i>have got in common.</i>

01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:41.560
<i>But with religion I think we're</i>

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.200
<i>two different people with that.</i>

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:49.640
That's really nice.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.400
Big smiles for me, boys.

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.800
Yeah, that's great!

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.360
<i>If I really, really</i>
<i>don't wanna do something,</i>

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.480
then I will stand up to it
and then I'll just say mum,

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:04.080
I really don't want to do this.

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.720
[man] But
absolutely killing it,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:09.200
and I'm not pointing
any fingers,

01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:11.480
four guys had a chance
right in front of goal,

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:13.200
dropped every single one.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.440
[Graham] <i>Not going to</i>
<i>church every Sunday,</i>

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.480
<i>is just one of</i>
<i>those things that,</i>

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:21.600
<i>I don't know, we just</i>
<i>don't go to anymore.</i>

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.600
[boys cheering]

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.800
<i>I definitely think she's</i>
<i>strong about her religion.</i>

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.120
<i>But I don't think her not</i>
<i>going to church is gonna...</i>

01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:36.800
<i>She's not losing</i>
<i>her faith any more.</i>

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.240
It's just, I don't know, she
just wants to put like...

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:46.520
The family first.

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:10.920
[Ebony] The eight's big,
I needed like a middle size,
or a six longer.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:12.600
[Jade speaks indistinctly]

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.560
[Ebony] I know that's
what I just said.

01:15:14.640 --> 01:15:16.760
[Jade] You haven't done
your shoelaces up properly.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.360
I like thicker
shoelaces, they tie easier.

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.960
[Jade] Is that better?

01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:29.640
Yeah, not so big on
being a singer anymore.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.720
Just seems too out of reach.

01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:39.440
Newtown isn't that big
a thing anymore, so.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.560
I don't know.

01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:47.040
[Ebony laughs]

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.760
It's too big!

01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:53.680
It looks good,
it looks very good.

01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:55.720
You look so old.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:57.760
What you want me
to look six again?

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.600
[Jade] That'd be good.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:04.840
[Ebony] <i>I reckon it's</i>
<i>just made me mature up</i>
<i>a bit about music.</i>

01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.480
<i>I reckon I'm a bit more</i>
<i>self aware now and,</i>

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:12.240
<i>understand what's</i>
<i>going on around me.</i>

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.120
<i>Bit more grown up.</i>

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.880
[Seth] Ebony, you look
like an actual teenager!

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.120
[Ebony] What are you
doing on your head?

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:26.120
[Jade] Look at her,
she looks so grown-up!

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:32.320
[Ebony] <i>I was a little bit</i>
<i>anxious that they wouldn't</i>

01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.160
<i>accept my gay parents.</i>

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.400
Give me a kiss.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.800
I'll see you this afternoon.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:43.560
[Ebony]
If they have a problem
with it, they're not worth it.

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:53.000
Try and harass me
they'll kick their butts.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:00.160
Whatever school you
go to, part of it is,

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:03.600
you know that you have
to do debating this year,
or join the orchestra.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.240
I don't want
to do either of those,
and you cannot make me.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:07.840
-I can make you!
-You cannot make me.

01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:09.240
-Of course I can.
-No you can't.

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.920
-Of course I can.
-No you can't.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.320
Whole point of being a parent.

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.120
[Gus] It doesn't let you
force things onto your child.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:19.160
It does, actually, baby,
that's the whole point.

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.960
That's why everyone's
cranky with their parents,

01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.800
'cause their parents
force things on them.

01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.960
It's really what's allowed.

01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:27.920
-Child abuse.
-I'll call the police
right now, Mum.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.840
No, they can only work
on child abuse baby,

01:17:29.920 --> 01:17:31.800
and having to do
orchestra or debating,

01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:33.240
that's not child abuse,
I'm sorry.

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.280
That is definitely child abuse,
you're trying to make me dead.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:37.640
[Jane] It's not,
sending a child to school!

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.120
Because in debating
it's so boring,

01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.600
so I'll get bored and
I'll fall off my chair.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.720
Then I'll quit,
and then everything
around me will be bad,

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:44.240
and then I'll commit suicide.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:46.240
I'm dead, you killed me.

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:47.800
And then, in...

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.480
Music, you try and
make me deaf so I can't

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:54.320
hear anything, and I can't
hear the traffic lights,

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:56.480
and then I die because
I go into the road.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.840
Killed me.

01:17:57.920 --> 01:17:59.280
Gus, that's not
a good argument.

01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.080
-Neither of those
arguments are--
-It's a great argument!

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.680
It's not a great argument,
it's a terrible argument.

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:06.040
See, that's why I
shouldn't go into debating.

01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.000
That's why you
should go to debating,
at least be better at it.

01:18:11.880 --> 01:18:14.000
[Gus] <i>I just love</i>
<i>the way Jen is,</i>

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.040
<i>how she teases me about</i>
<i>not liking wrestling.</i>

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.920
<i>I wouldn't </i>
<i>want to change that.</i>

01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:23.680
[Jane] Are you wearing
one of those belts?

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:27.880
[Gus] <i>Like, I think it would</i>
<i>be boring if everybody</i>

01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.200
<i>had the same opinion</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.520
<i>I think that it would </i>
<i>be totally awesome</i>
<i>if every single person </i>

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:37.720
<i>had their own opinion</i>
<i>about stuff.</i>

01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:48.800
[woman] <i>Something</i>
<i>very glamorous about </i> WWE.

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.800
[wrestler] <i>It's just all</i>
<i>about really having fun.</i>

01:18:52.120 --> 01:18:54.800
<i>One thing about the WWE</i>
<i>is the family thing.</i>

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:57.240
[man] <i>Probably one</i>
<i>of the best experiences</i>
<i>I've ever had.</i>

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.160
[crowd cheering]

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.080
[bell dinging]

01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.240
[announcer shouting]

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.960
[horns honking]

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.200
[fireworks exploding]

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.280
Happy Mardi Gras!

01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:44.800
Happy Mardi Gras!

01:20:56.080 --> 01:21:00.160
[Gus] <i>I don't really think it</i>
<i>actually makes me that unique</i>
<i>that I have two mums.</i>

01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:06.520
<i>It's just different for</i>
<i>every person growing up.</i>

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.640
<i>The people who raise</i>
<i>you and make you</i>

01:21:14.720 --> 01:21:16.880
<i>who you are today</i>
<i>are your family.</i>

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:22.920
[crowd cheering]

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:48.280
[crowd cheering]
