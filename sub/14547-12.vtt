00:01.042 --> 00:03.545
(Tessa)
Okay, so, in case
you don't remember

00:03.586 --> 00:06.006
my ex-boyfriend, Ryan,
came back but not for me.

00:06.047 --> 00:07.841
He moved on
with his girlfriend, June.

00:07.882 --> 00:09.384
Lisa and Malik
were determined not to let

00:09.426 --> 00:11.052
the same thing happen to them.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.387
And after a rough patch

00:12.429 --> 00:14.347
they surprised everyone with..

00:14.389 --> 00:16.558
Lisa Marie Shay..

00:16.599 --> 00:18.268
...will you marry me?

00:19.519 --> 00:21.271
Yes.

00:21.312 --> 00:22.856
[all applaud]

00:22.897 --> 00:24.774
And as maid of honor..

00:24.816 --> 00:28.194
...I had no other choice
but to get with the program.

00:28.236 --> 00:30.071
I don't think
we need a program.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.489
No program.

00:31.531 --> 00:33.408
But I do wanna discuss
my walk down the aisle.

00:33.450 --> 00:37.120
- Okay, I just assumed that--
- I have something else in mind.

00:37.162 --> 00:38.329
Did you happen to see
the season three

00:38.371 --> 00:41.124
finale of "Game of Thrones?"

00:41.166 --> 00:45.128
(Lisa)
I walk amongst my people,
greet them.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.672
They scream my name
with devotion.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.091
(Tessa)
I see...and where is Malik
during all this?

00:50.133 --> 00:51.885
(Lisa)
Oh, he's there, too.

00:51.926 --> 00:55.555
We exchange our vows as my
young dragons circle overhead.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.390
[dragons roar]

00:57.432 --> 00:59.100
And then we exit
to Malik's favorite song

00:59.142 --> 01:00.935
by Rich Homie Quan.

01:00.977 --> 01:03.480
Look, even if we could
afford newly freed

01:03.521 --> 01:06.816
Yunkish slaves and dragons
and Rich Homie Quan.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.902
I just don't think
that our venue is going

01:08.943 --> 01:10.653
to allow for that
kind of re-enactment.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.114
Now, I wanna go over the
dimensions of your backyard.

01:13.156 --> 01:14.491
And the budget
your mom gave me.

01:14.532 --> 01:16.534
- Money is no object.
- I'm sorry?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.328
We are having
a private conversation

01:18.369 --> 01:19.621
that doesn't include you.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.831
- Tell her, Lisa.
- Tell me what?

01:21.873 --> 01:24.626
Tell her how
I'm queen of honor.

01:24.667 --> 01:29.506
Oh...Dalia has decided to be
queen of honor at our wedding.

01:29.547 --> 01:32.008
And I have decided not to die
on this hill.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.970
What exactly does
queen of honor do?

01:36.012 --> 01:39.265
She basically just, like,
looks extremely pretty

01:39.307 --> 01:41.518
and is, like,
very, very honored.

01:41.559 --> 01:42.560
I see.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.312
And the maid of honor..

01:44.354 --> 01:46.356
...cleans up after her
and then checks to see

01:46.397 --> 01:48.858
if there's anything
the queen might need.

01:48.900 --> 01:52.737
Like a clear Pepsi.
Or some edamame.

01:52.779 --> 01:54.823
Why did you agree to this?

01:54.864 --> 01:57.867
Because Dalia graciously
volunteered to donate

01:57.909 --> 02:00.370
all of the China, silver,
glassware and spirits.

02:00.411 --> 02:03.623
And also to perform
"Suddenly Seymour."

02:03.665 --> 02:06.209
And also to perform
"Suddenly Seymour."

02:06.251 --> 02:08.002
It's in my range.

Okay.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.058
Okay, so I'm thinking

02:22.100 --> 02:23.143
the groom's family

02:23.184 --> 02:24.185
will be on this side.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.728
And the bride's family..

02:25.770 --> 02:28.356
...you guys will be
seated over here.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.150
Now, how many people
do you think

02:30.191 --> 02:32.152
we can fit
back here comfortably?

02:32.193 --> 02:33.278
Well, let's see..

02:33.319 --> 02:35.113
We hosted 60 nudes last summer

02:35.155 --> 02:36.364
for our Bottom Knockers event.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.366
Ooh.
Ouch! She said comfortably.

02:38.408 --> 02:39.826
[both chuckle]

02:39.868 --> 02:41.119
- It was a tight squeeze.
- Yeah.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.079
Things got a little messy.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.623
Actually, I'm not comfortable.

02:45.665 --> 02:48.585
Tessa, it may sound saucy,
but the Bottom Knockers

02:48.626 --> 02:50.461
is simply a mature group
of Christian Potters

02:50.503 --> 02:52.839
who prefer to spin
in the nude.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.550
Together, we nudely celebrate
our faith in the Lord

02:55.592 --> 02:58.678
and...our love of glazed
earthenware.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.346
Okay, so, um..

03:00.388 --> 03:02.557
- No more than 40?
- 40's safe.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.726
(Tessa)
But 40 might have been
a little ambitious.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.729
All those in favor of Malik
throwing away his future

03:07.770 --> 03:10.940
to marry his 17-year-old
classmate say "Aye."

03:10.982 --> 03:12.567
Aye.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.819
- All those opposed, say "Nay."
- Nay.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.071
- Nay.
- Looks like the nays have it.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.490
Nay, they don't.
Look...I'm sorry that

03:19.532 --> 03:20.867
the family doesn't approve.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.869
'But Lisa and I are
getting married.'

03:22.911 --> 03:23.953
The state says
I'm old enough to decide

03:23.995 --> 03:25.288
for myself, and I've decided.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.582
- The man's decided.
- Well, then so have I.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.459
Hear that? Edmond's decided
something, too.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.377
You want to be a...big man?

03:31.419 --> 03:34.505
You wanna disregard
the counsel of your parents?

03:34.547 --> 03:37.717
Then next year,
you're on your own.

03:37.759 --> 03:39.928
[scoffs]
So-so what? So you're not gonna
pay for college?

03:39.969 --> 03:41.512
- You're not gonna pay for--
- Any of it.

03:41.554 --> 03:43.056
You want to play house,
play house.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.724
Get a job
and support your family.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.768
What? So, you're gonna
my future just because I don't--

03:46.809 --> 03:50.188
Oh! You're the one sabotaging,
Malik! You!

03:50.230 --> 03:53.524
- Miles, sit your ass down.
- Sit your ass down, Miles.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.401
Really, no one asked you, Miles.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.278
Fine. No, I hope
you all can live with this

03:57.320 --> 03:59.822

because I don't intend to.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.248
Okay.
I told you it wasn't gonna work.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.667
- I told you.
- Ah.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.879
[sighs]
Hey...I did my part.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.386
- Do you like it?
- I do.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.389
But I don't.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.808
It needs more tulle
and 50 more feet of train

04:26.849 --> 04:28.768
and animatronic birds
that sing my name.

04:28.810 --> 04:30.395
[grunts]
Okay.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.314
This here is
dinner service for 40.

04:33.356 --> 04:37.485
Just do me a solid and ask the
staff not to stack the goblets.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.820
You can ask them yourself.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.114
Oh, I won't be
in attendance.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.493
What?
You're not coming to my wedding?

04:45.535 --> 04:48.454
I'm not going to Lisa
and Malik's wedding

04:48.496 --> 04:52.292
because, quite frankly,
I'm a wedding jinx.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.711
Every wedding I've ever been
to has ended in divorce.

04:54.752 --> 04:56.254
Including my own.

04:56.296 --> 04:59.716
Mommy, that is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

04:59.757 --> 05:02.552
Marriages fail because of
poor communication and poorness

05:02.593 --> 05:04.804
and sexy assistants
and diminished returns

05:04.846 --> 05:07.223
and letting yourself go
and GMO's and HBO

05:07.265 --> 05:09.767
and Catherine Zeta Jones.

05:09.809 --> 05:13.187
And Catherine Zeta Jones'
personality.

05:13.229 --> 05:15.898
And the way she, like, thinks
she's better than everyone.

05:15.940 --> 05:18.526
- Oh.
- It has nothing to do with you.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.571
I mean,
how narcissistic can you be?

05:23.573 --> 05:24.699
Okay, so I crunched
some numbers.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.826
You crunched some numbers?

05:26.868 --> 05:28.202
Tessa, I can't help
but feel that

05:28.244 --> 05:29.787
you're approaching
this the wrong way.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.664
Yeah, we're not preparing
our tax returns.

05:31.706 --> 05:34.292
We're preparing to make a note
of eternal and undying love.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.044
Even so, the budget
your parents

05:36.085 --> 05:37.253
gave me just isn't
gonna support it.

05:37.295 --> 05:38.838
Oh, what about
my dowry chest?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.423
Have you opened it?
Because I have.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.924
And it's mostly just coupons

05:41.966 --> 05:43.593
for a free birthday cone
at Friendly's.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.844
Now we're talking.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.888
No, that is of no use
to anyone.

05:46.929 --> 05:50.683
'Look, something's gotta give.
I have an event to put on here.'

05:50.725 --> 05:53.519
People got to get fed,
pictures got to get snapped.

05:53.561 --> 05:55.229
And I'm assuming
you'll want people to shake

05:55.271 --> 05:56.773
their bodies
in time to the music.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.024
That is customary, yes.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.568
Okay.
There's got to be music.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.862
'Okay, now, after all
those invoices are paid.'

06:02.904 --> 06:04.697
I'm hoping there's gonna
be enough in the kitty

06:04.739 --> 06:06.532
for a bell or a whistle.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.326
But it's probably
not gonna be both.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.369
What kitty?

06:09.410 --> 06:10.912
So I am asking you what is

06:10.953 --> 06:12.955
the single most valuable add-on

06:12.997 --> 06:14.415
I can provide to make
this wedding

06:14.457 --> 06:16.167
reasonably special?

06:16.209 --> 06:17.835
(in unison)
Fireflies.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.712
- As in bugs?
- Lightning bugs.

06:19.754 --> 06:22.215
- They're incredibly romantic.
- They're beetles.

06:22.256 --> 06:23.257
The whole point of their
bio-luminescence

06:23.299 --> 06:24.717
is to attract a mate.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.469
I mean, that's their
whole reason for living.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.638
And that's the most
important part of our wedding.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.515
But you guys have already
attracted a mate.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.475
Oh, but we want someone
to hook up at our wedding.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.310
Yeah, if someone hooks up at
your wedding, it's a good omen.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.479
And anyone who cares about me
knows that I am very

06:36.521 --> 06:38.689
superstitious
when it comes to omens..

06:38.731 --> 06:41.484
...good or bad.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.486
(Malik)
'If Lisa were to find out
my parents aren't coming'

06:43.528 --> 06:45.029
she'd think it was
a bad omen.

06:45.071 --> 06:47.824
Is there any chance of your
mom and dad coming around?

06:47.865 --> 06:49.450
I-I really don't think so.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.829
That being said I have a..

06:52.870 --> 06:54.956
...slightly awkward
question to ask you.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.667
Oh. Okay.

06:57.708 --> 06:59.168
[chuckles]
Well, right.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.795
Well, look, man, the, uh,
the wedding night

07:00.837 --> 07:02.338
doesn't have to be about that.

07:02.380 --> 07:04.715
You know, you guys could
just order in, watch a movie.

07:04.757 --> 07:06.592
- And then when it feels right..
- Oh, no, no. No, no.

07:06.634 --> 07:08.219
It's-it's not that.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.221
That, I don't need
any help with.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.808
Oh.
Good for you.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.894
I was wondering
if maybe you could

07:16.936 --> 07:19.021
walk me down the aisle.

07:19.063 --> 07:22.191
Does the groom
get walked down the aisle?

07:22.233 --> 07:24.318
What?
You want me to walk alone?

07:24.360 --> 07:26.237
No. No.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.613
I don't want that at all.

07:27.655 --> 07:29.031
But..

07:29.073 --> 07:30.825
[sighs]
I got to believe your parents.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.161
Listen, my parents
are boycotting this wedding.

07:33.202 --> 07:34.579
My entire family is.

07:36.038 --> 07:37.248
If you don't wanna walk
with me, it's..

07:37.290 --> 07:39.041
Are you kidding me?

07:39.083 --> 07:41.419
I absolutely
wanna walk with you.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.463
Please.
I'll walk you silly.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.256
I'll walk like an Egyptian
if you want me to.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.216
Just regular walking is fine.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.843
Well, I got that.

07:53.264 --> 07:55.391
So, the price you're
quoting me is for the pupa?

07:55.433 --> 07:56.726
And there's
no guarantee that they'll

07:56.767 --> 07:58.269
hatch before the wedding?

07:58.311 --> 08:00.730
I'm sorry, I can't do that.
That's insane.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.150
That's more than plated
dinner service. No deal.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.944
But midway through French,
it was still nagging at me.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.405
Maybe I had made
the wrong choice.

08:09.447 --> 08:12.366
Maybe I was supposed to
gamble on the pupa.

08:12.408 --> 08:14.118
Why did romance feel
like a foreign language?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.746
I was unable to speak.

08:16.787 --> 08:18.915
I was fluent in it once before.

08:18.956 --> 08:21.834
And it was still happening
all around me.

with Elise.

Mademoiselle Mimi looked

08:37.183 --> 08:39.268

[woman singing in French]

08:42.480 --> 08:47.068
And was that an accident,
or was it fate?

08:47.109 --> 08:49.278
And more importantly..

08:49.320 --> 08:51.948
...where did that sexy janitor
come from?

08:56.327 --> 09:00.331
Apparently, love was
in the air.

09:00.373 --> 09:03.334
And I owed it to Lisa and Malik
to stop thinking with my head

09:03.376 --> 09:05.002
and start thinking with my..

09:05.044 --> 09:06.837

09:08.548 --> 09:09.840
The heart wants what it wants.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.718
And in this case,
it's baby beetles.

09:12.760 --> 09:15.721
Okay.
Here are her dental records.

09:15.763 --> 09:18.266
As you can see, she had
a cleaning three months ago.

09:18.307 --> 09:19.725
So you should be set
until summer.

09:19.767 --> 09:22.228
Uh, this is her,
uh, menses calendar.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.896
She's on a 28-day cycle.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.774
Uh, the red dot indicates
when the curse commences.

09:26.816 --> 09:29.151
Now, about the week before,
I would, uh..

09:29.193 --> 09:31.404
- Pretty much steer clear.
- Yes.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.531
- Just stay out of her way.
- That's a wise man.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.157
Oh! She had that
stomach flu last month.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.659
Got pretty dehydrated.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.286
Yeah, uh, but we topped off
all her fluids.

09:38.327 --> 09:40.162
And she shouldn't be
giving you any problems.

09:40.204 --> 09:41.581
- Okay.
- Should be running smoothly.

09:41.622 --> 09:43.916
- Yeah.
- Thanks, mom. Thanks, dad.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.043

09:46.961 --> 09:49.046
Oh, dear. I'm sorry.

I don't know how that
slipped out.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.300

I usually keep my emotions

09:52.341 --> 09:55.261
buried deep within my
recto-uterine pouch.

09:55.303 --> 09:58.014
But, uh, this is
very unexpected.

at times.

How are your folks doing
with all this?

10:08.107 --> 10:10.443
Uh, you know what?
I-I should get going.

10:10.484 --> 10:12.069
It's-it's getting late,
and I still

10:12.111 --> 10:13.946
got to file all this stuff.

10:13.988 --> 10:17.241
Malik, I can't tell you
how delighted

10:17.283 --> 10:20.286
we are to welcome you
into our family.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.748
And I think I speak
for all the Shay's when I say--

10:23.789 --> 10:25.082
No backsies!

10:25.124 --> 10:27.251
[laughs]

10:27.293 --> 10:29.295

10:34.216 --> 10:36.636
Malik still wasn't speaking
to his parents.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.179
But with the wedding
approaching

10:38.220 --> 10:39.722
George knew he had to.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.265
I don't know if you
guys have made a decision

10:41.307 --> 10:42.933
about attending
the wedding or not.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.604
But...as someone who has
spent a fair amount of time

10:46.646 --> 10:48.064
estranged from his own daughter

10:48.105 --> 10:51.192
I can tell you,
it is not worth it.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.777
We're worried about him, George.

10:52.818 --> 10:54.111
Yeah, we're worried
that he's biting off

10:54.153 --> 10:55.154
more than he can chew.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.781
And he-he probably is.

10:56.822 --> 10:59.116
Look, marriage is-is tough

10:59.158 --> 11:01.243
no matter what age you are.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.788
But having the support
of your family can help.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.790
Why not give him
every advantage?

11:05.831 --> 11:09.752
Oh, he had every advantage,
George.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.421
advantage.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.548
Miles, not now.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.884
Please, Miles, take it easy.
It's time for your bath.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.512
Okay.
But I'm not getting my hair wet.

So, George,
if Tessa decided tomorrow

11:32.149 --> 11:33.859
that she was ready
to tie the knot.

11:33.901 --> 11:37.363
I'd be terrified...Tracy, yes.

11:37.405 --> 11:40.324
