WEBVTT

00:00.688 --> 00:02.599
<i>Previously on</i> The Bridge...

00:02.625 --> 00:04.125
It's a national security matter.

00:04.193 --> 00:06.828
We'd like some perspective on
events that led to the shooting

00:06.896 --> 00:07.962
two days ago.

00:08.029 --> 00:09.931
Hank and I were working with Agent McKenzie

00:09.999 --> 00:11.332
on the Eleanor Nacht case.

00:11.400 --> 00:14.802
Agent McKenzie never filed a
report on his investigation.

00:14.870 --> 00:16.571
I took something out of the house.

00:16.639 --> 00:18.740
<i>It's a ledger.</i>

00:18.807 --> 00:21.743
<i>I hid it</i> <i>right before they grabbed me.</i>

00:21.810 --> 00:24.512
<i>I need for you</i> <i>to go get that now.</i>

00:24.580 --> 00:26.347
Your husband reached out to us.

00:26.415 --> 00:29.017
Did he ever talk to you about his work?

00:29.084 --> 00:31.219
He had a special project in the garage.

00:32.287 --> 00:34.355
It's fine.

00:34.423 --> 00:35.823
- Can you grab this?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:35.891 --> 00:37.325
Grab that.

00:38.894 --> 00:41.329
It's a war between the DEA and the CIA.

I want another life.

01:00.416 --> 01:02.350
Robles has to pay for what he did.

01:02.418 --> 01:04.218
Eleanor's gone.

01:04.286 --> 01:05.753
Transferred into federal custody.

01:05.821 --> 01:07.956
On whose authority? DEA?

01:08.023 --> 01:10.224
No, that spooky-ass Buckley signed for her.

01:10.292 --> 01:14.889
We'll get the ledger back,
but this needs to be fixed immediately.

01:38.177 --> 01:40.579
Hal.

01:42.491 --> 01:46.649
Well, what did you go and get
yourself into this time, Monte?

01:46.675 --> 01:48.609
Antelope hunting.

01:48.677 --> 01:50.377
Gut shot him.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.112
Got some blood in the stitching.

01:52.180 --> 01:54.114
Well, hell, I can see that.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.683
Can you fix 'em?

01:55.750 --> 01:57.217
I reckon.

01:58.920 --> 02:00.788
Cancer?

02:00.855 --> 02:02.660
Leukemia.

02:02.686 --> 02:05.359
Mama works over at the Mason's.

02:05.852 --> 02:08.495
Bless her heart.

02:15.648 --> 02:17.482
Thank you, Hal.

02:33.421 --> 02:35.356
Have you been following me?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.790
Yes.

02:36.858 --> 02:39.126
Well, you're out.

02:39.194 --> 02:41.128
Yes.

02:41.196 --> 02:43.797
You have magic friends.

02:46.835 --> 02:49.303
Sonya Cross has the ledger.

02:49.371 --> 02:51.538
I know.

02:52.574 --> 02:54.775
I'm almost done cleaning up.

02:54.843 --> 02:57.311
Soon, the ledger won't matter anymore.

02:57.379 --> 02:59.313
Everything?

02:59.381 --> 03:01.215
All the assets, yes.

03:01.282 --> 03:04.985
Everything else is related to Fausto, and...

03:05.053 --> 03:06.987
Fausto is no longer my problem.

03:07.055 --> 03:09.123
Until he is <i> vámonos,</i>

03:09.190 --> 03:11.792
he is everybody's problem.

03:15.370 --> 03:17.571
Does Sebastian still have what I want?

03:19.200 --> 03:21.335
He's a man of his word.

03:21.403 --> 03:23.337
Are you?

03:24.639 --> 03:25.806
Pardon?

03:25.874 --> 03:28.041
I've come through slaughter for this.

03:28.109 --> 03:31.289
You somehow have come out of
this untouched, Monte.

03:31.574 --> 03:33.475
How is that possible?

03:34.082 --> 03:36.583
I provide good counsel.

03:38.019 --> 03:41.221
I am punctual, I work hard.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.590
I will not be sold out, Monte.

03:43.658 --> 03:45.793
Our deal still stands.

03:46.828 --> 03:49.062
I don't trust you.

03:50.284 --> 03:52.404
I'll have you know,
I'm a certified marksman.

03:55.497 --> 03:57.565
State your business, Eleanor.

04:02.230 --> 04:04.832
When I'm done cleaning up,

04:04.858 --> 04:07.126
I will expect what I'm due.

04:11.886 --> 04:14.988
I believe Sebastian has
other matters to attend to,

04:15.048 --> 04:17.579
but I will convey your demand.

04:17.605 --> 04:19.540
What matters?

04:19.603 --> 04:22.205
Fausto Galvan has his daughter.

04:22.664 --> 04:25.332
Fausto's a demon.

04:25.400 --> 04:27.668
He will be hard to vanquish.

04:29.483 --> 04:31.851
We're working on that.

04:34.976 --> 04:36.977
Good-bye, Monte.

06:50.083 --> 06:52.084
Shit.

08:01.521 --> 08:03.522
Hank?

08:04.676 --> 08:06.877
Hank?

08:07.360 --> 08:08.493
I figured it out.

08:08.561 --> 08:10.595
Hank, I figured out the code.

08:10.663 --> 08:13.565
Sonya. They know you got the ledger.

08:13.633 --> 08:16.034
They-they questioned me about it.

08:16.102 --> 08:17.469
It's-it's... it's addresses.

08:17.537 --> 08:20.105
See, it's eight-nine-two-cave,
two-seven-six...

08:20.173 --> 08:21.540
Sonya, listen to me.

08:21.607 --> 08:24.342
They're gonna come after you
because you got that book.

08:24.410 --> 08:25.977
They already did.

08:27.580 --> 08:29.147
You share this with anybody?

08:29.215 --> 08:31.149
- No.
- Good.

08:31.217 --> 08:33.784
Where are they holding Eleanor?

08:33.852 --> 08:36.243
They transferred her to CIA custody.

08:36.269 --> 08:38.816
Shit. They're gonna put
her back on the street.

08:38.855 --> 08:40.458
- Why would they do that?
- Because, Sonya,

08:40.525 --> 08:43.322
the CIA doesn't play by the rules.

08:43.347 --> 08:45.697
I don't care. I'm going to
check out these addresses.

08:45.765 --> 08:47.733
Not alone, you're not.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.434
Hank, please.

08:49.502 --> 08:51.169
I-I don't think this is a good idea.

08:51.237 --> 08:52.537
Hank, please.

08:52.605 --> 08:55.373
My clothes are over there.

08:55.441 --> 08:57.776
- Yeah?
- I'll get 'em myself.

09:14.660 --> 09:17.195
Marco Ruiz.

09:40.681 --> 09:43.616
<i>Sí.</i> _

10:09.610 --> 10:10.743
Eh?

11:00.494 --> 11:01.861
<i>Pendejo.</i>

11:09.903 --> 11:11.137
Fausto.

11:13.886 --> 11:15.453
Obregon.

11:22.623 --> 11:24.491
No, no, no, no, no!

11:35.829 --> 11:38.498
You're late. I ordered you pie.

11:38.565 --> 11:41.267
- Pecan.
- I have a nut allergy.

11:41.335 --> 11:44.570
Too bad. Have mine.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.706
- It's rhubarb.
- Thanks.

11:46.773 --> 11:48.741
Tart. I like it.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.109
Do you have it?

11:50.177 --> 11:52.778
Detective Cross does.

11:52.846 --> 11:55.014
Eleanor is thorough... she'll clean it up,

11:55.082 --> 11:57.083
and when she's done,
Detective Cross will have

11:57.150 --> 11:58.918
a whole lot of nothing.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.920
What else is in the ledger?

12:00.988 --> 12:03.022
A bunch of bat-shit crazy drawings.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.357
We should be okay.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.893
We have to be better than okay, Alex.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.329
I had to go through Chandler at
State to get Eleanor released.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.431
I told him she was an operative,

12:12.499 --> 12:14.433
Mexicans cooperated...

12:14.501 --> 12:16.581
Do I need to know anything else,
Alex, or do you have

12:16.637 --> 12:18.404
a handle on this thing?

12:18.472 --> 12:20.273
- Lard crust.
- Answer me.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.508
I think the reporters

12:22.576 --> 12:25.344
got some intel from Joe's house.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.846
How did that happen?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.347
Don't worry about it.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.516
I'll be paying them a visit.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.685
I've dealt with wordsmiths before.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.288
Are you gonna shut down the pipeline?

12:35.355 --> 12:36.789
I'm working on it.

12:36.857 --> 12:39.959
The, uh, Mexican side of things
might be a bit tricky.

12:40.027 --> 12:41.961
You'd better, because the last thing we need

12:42.029 --> 12:43.796
is to be called in front of Congress.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.798
Mm. You should wear red.

12:45.866 --> 12:47.800
I mean, if that happens.

12:47.868 --> 12:49.468
It's a power color.

12:49.536 --> 12:51.704
I'm glad you find this amusing.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.708
I get it... I'm alone on this.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.543
Oh, yes. You are.

12:57.611 --> 12:58.911
Very.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.785
Manage Sebastian.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.372
We'll need him for a clean transition.

13:08.388 --> 13:10.323
I'll see what I can do.

13:10.390 --> 13:13.593
And no more bodies in El Paso,
for God's sake.

13:15.596 --> 13:17.663
Good-bye, Alex.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.806
It's about drugs and money,
and it's all in there.

13:28.269 --> 13:31.344
Marco went after Fausto
without any leverage.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.279
We need to get it for him.

13:33.347 --> 13:34.780
Maybe.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.882
Not gonna stop it, though.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.585
Nothing is going to change, Sonya.

13:39.653 --> 13:42.855
Both sides... Mexico,

13:42.923 --> 13:46.392
United States... they have to put on a show.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.365
Used to be I thought I
could make a difference.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.638
You ever spit in the ocean?

13:58.705 --> 14:02.341
Why would I spit in the ocean?

14:04.911 --> 14:07.346
It is vast...

14:07.414 --> 14:09.548
and we are not.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.717
Ah, hell,

14:11.785 --> 14:12.885
I'm sorry.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.820
Getting shot always makes me a little soft

14:14.888 --> 14:16.889
for a few days... I'll get over it.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.466
You all right, Hank?

14:27.534 --> 14:29.368
I'm all right.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.305
Hello?

14:34.908 --> 14:36.868
Hank.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.454
She beat us to it.

14:48.522 --> 14:50.156
Yes, she did.

14:50.223 --> 14:53.492
My bet is she's already
on her way back to Mexico.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.300
She had help.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.636
Yeah. Cesar.

15:03.704 --> 15:06.572
That's the ass-hat that
stole my folding knife.

15:06.640 --> 15:09.120
Let's go to the next address.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.629
Romina?

15:42.536 --> 15:45.038
Burn it.

15:59.954 --> 16:02.289
What do you want me to do with him?

16:06.004 --> 16:09.071
- Is that everything?
- Yes.

16:09.097 --> 16:11.264
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

16:11.332 --> 16:12.999
Please...

16:13.067 --> 16:14.134
I have a family.

16:14.201 --> 16:15.335
Put him in the car.

16:15.403 --> 16:16.703
I thought we were done.

16:16.771 --> 16:18.705
No, we're not done yet, Cesar.

16:37.825 --> 16:38.958
Yeah.

16:39.026 --> 16:41.394
I want to see Captain Robles.

16:41.462 --> 16:43.363
Do you have an appointment?

16:43.431 --> 16:45.765
No, I do not.

16:45.833 --> 16:46.900
Well, he's not here.

16:48.803 --> 16:50.937
When will he be back?

16:51.005 --> 16:52.672
What is that?

16:55.943 --> 16:59.112
This is a paperweight.

17:03.984 --> 17:06.886
Could I ask you... to take a message?

17:06.954 --> 17:08.454
Okay.

17:08.521 --> 17:11.023
Tell... tell the captain...

17:12.193 --> 17:15.028
no man can run from his past.

17:16.830 --> 17:19.165
Are you gonna write that down?

17:23.738 --> 17:26.005
Okay.

17:26.073 --> 17:27.840
Anything else?

17:27.907 --> 17:29.576
Nope.

17:32.446 --> 17:34.614
And who-who are you?

17:37.051 --> 17:39.152
Oh, I'm his past.

18:00.841 --> 18:04.115
I've been sitting here thinking...

18:04.979 --> 18:06.913
about a life with you.

18:06.981 --> 18:09.149
Yeah?

18:09.216 --> 18:11.551
Right there in that house.

18:15.790 --> 18:18.270
What's so special about that house?

18:19.927 --> 18:21.961
It's...

18:22.029 --> 18:23.129
pink.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.203
I don't know, it just got me thinking.

18:30.271 --> 18:31.871
What would our life...

18:31.939 --> 18:34.541
be like in that house?

18:34.608 --> 18:37.043
Our life together.

18:40.181 --> 18:42.182
Where were you?

18:43.784 --> 18:46.252
I went to see Robles.

18:47.321 --> 18:50.390
I can't stop thinking about him.

18:50.458 --> 18:52.826
We can walk away.

18:55.296 --> 18:58.064
No, we can't.

18:58.132 --> 19:00.733
I can't make sense of a world

19:00.801 --> 19:03.837
where a man like that can live, thrive.

19:03.904 --> 19:06.239
With his children.

19:13.981 --> 19:18.251
The world can only bear so
much before a sunderance.

19:29.230 --> 19:32.999
When I come back, will you be here?

19:34.034 --> 19:36.302
I don't know.

19:44.011 --> 19:46.312
Romina.

19:58.158 --> 19:59.859
Okay.

20:24.351 --> 20:26.152
No, no, no, no.

20:38.299 --> 20:39.966
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

20:50.377 --> 20:52.145
Called in earlier.

20:52.212 --> 20:54.547
- Anybody hurt?
- Manager's missing.

20:54.615 --> 20:56.716
Some kind of break-in, we think.

20:56.784 --> 20:58.618
We're too late.

21:00.220 --> 21:02.388
We're chasing our own tails now.

21:06.527 --> 21:08.061
What the hell are they doing here?

21:08.128 --> 21:10.029
Reporters.

21:10.097 --> 21:11.464
What are you guys doing here?

21:11.532 --> 21:13.333
Well, we were, uh, just cruising for chicks.

21:13.400 --> 21:15.001
Got no time for your bullshit, Frye.

21:15.069 --> 21:16.469
What are you doing here?

21:18.072 --> 21:20.039
Joe McKenzie believed this
was a money-laundering site.

21:20.107 --> 21:22.275
Look, if you know anything
about Joe McKenzie,

21:22.343 --> 21:25.578
you better tell me right now,
or I'm gonna kick your ass, Frye.

21:25.646 --> 21:27.213
We don't have to tell you shit.

21:27.483 --> 21:29.849
Hank, stop.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.050
Okay, okay, okay, okay!

21:31.118 --> 21:32.051
Stop it.

21:32.119 --> 21:33.653
- Okay!
- Daniel...

21:33.721 --> 21:36.489
you realize I'm no
longer acting lieutenant, right?

21:36.557 --> 21:38.558
- No, I didn't know that.
- All right, that's enough.

21:38.626 --> 21:39.993
We need your help.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.540
Marco's life might depend on it.

21:47.301 --> 21:50.326
You got a prescription for these pills?

21:51.105 --> 21:53.006
Look, you can threaten me,
you can rough me up.

21:53.073 --> 21:54.407
I don't care. I've been working

21:54.475 --> 21:56.109
on this story for months.
You know what? You all thought

21:56.176 --> 21:57.977
-  I was drunk and full of shit.
- You are full of shit.

21:58.045 --> 21:59.345
You don't work at the paper anymore.

21:59.413 --> 22:01.881
I was right about the CIA,
Red Ridge, all of it.

22:01.949 --> 22:04.350
Okay, so what are you gonna do? Blog it?

22:04.418 --> 22:05.618
Yeah, on FascistCop.com.

22:05.686 --> 22:07.520
- You still running the site?
- Hank.

22:07.588 --> 22:09.622
What?

22:09.690 --> 22:12.392
Listen, we all have been hurt by this.

22:12.459 --> 22:14.727
All right?

22:14.795 --> 22:16.729
We work together, we can stop them.

22:16.797 --> 22:19.332
Why don't you translate this for us.

22:20.934 --> 22:24.771
Fine. It's relatively simple.
Agent Joe McKenzie

22:24.838 --> 22:26.773
stumbles across a covert CIA operation

22:26.840 --> 22:28.875
that helps Fausto Galvan

22:28.942 --> 22:32.145
launder money and move shipments
of drugs over the border.

22:32.212 --> 22:33.646
In exchange for what?

22:33.714 --> 22:36.716
We're not exactly sure,
but from what we can tell, the CIA

22:36.784 --> 22:38.284
was protecting the cash
running through money houses

22:38.352 --> 22:39.819
and banks like Rayburn.

22:39.887 --> 22:41.888
So the DEA is trying to bust Fausto

22:41.955 --> 22:44.057
while the CIA is helping him?

22:44.124 --> 22:46.059
Yeah. And taking a pretty piece of it,
I'm guessing.

22:46.126 --> 22:47.427
Holy shit.

22:47.494 --> 22:49.295
We have no proof.

22:49.363 --> 22:51.164
Eleanor cleaned everything from the ledger.

22:51.231 --> 22:54.434
- Don't know.
- McKenzie had it on him.

22:54.501 --> 22:56.402
Well, did he give it to you?

22:56.470 --> 22:58.638
Mm, not exactly.

22:58.706 --> 23:00.506
He kept it at home, not at the office.

23:00.574 --> 23:03.342
Well, that still doesn't
explain how you got it.

23:03.410 --> 23:06.612
We kind of broke in and took it.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.581
Journalistic probable cause.

23:08.649 --> 23:10.917
Where is that?

23:10.984 --> 23:12.285
We don't know.

23:13.287 --> 23:15.321
I do.

23:21.595 --> 23:23.529
Holy shit. They're the same maps.

23:23.597 --> 23:26.199
But Eleanor's has GPS coordinates.

23:26.266 --> 23:27.867
Let's get out there.

23:52.317 --> 23:54.752
Well, this is it.

23:54.828 --> 23:56.829
It's a whole bunch of nothing.

23:56.897 --> 23:59.899
What could Joe be looking for out here?

24:17.384 --> 24:19.318
Hey, I found something!

24:19.386 --> 24:22.221
Over here!

24:24.892 --> 24:26.859
What you got?

24:28.128 --> 24:30.029
A Customs seal.

24:30.097 --> 24:32.098
It's not even ripped.

24:33.100 --> 24:35.034
What's the...

24:35.102 --> 24:38.371
what's the nearest border crossing?

24:38.438 --> 24:40.706
Well, there's a...

24:40.774 --> 24:44.677
there's an ag crossing a
couple of miles from here.

24:44.745 --> 24:47.313
Save yourself a lot of trouble at the border

24:47.381 --> 24:50.049
if you got one of these
things on your vehicle.

24:50.117 --> 24:53.186
You know, I got this guy at Customs...

24:55.189 --> 24:57.790
Good, uh...
good working with you again, Detective.

24:57.858 --> 24:59.859
It's been nice.

25:26.386 --> 25:27.720
Hi.

25:27.788 --> 25:29.755
You are really into the...

25:29.823 --> 25:31.824
the whole cowboy thing, aren't you?

25:31.892 --> 25:34.460
Yes, sir, I am.

25:34.528 --> 25:37.196
I had a horse step on my
foot once at summer camp.

25:37.264 --> 25:39.304
That was pretty much it for me and horses.

25:39.366 --> 25:41.868
Well, you got to show 'em who's boss.

25:43.337 --> 25:45.938
You check out of the hospital early, Hank?

25:46.006 --> 25:47.473
You consult with your doctor?

25:47.541 --> 25:48.741
No need. I'm fine.

25:48.809 --> 25:50.643
You're... bleeding.

25:52.079 --> 25:53.813
Little bit.

25:53.881 --> 25:55.147
You know, I have a brother

25:55.215 --> 25:57.683
who's a surgeon.
He could probably get you in.

25:57.751 --> 26:00.019
You want to be careful
about secondary infections.

26:00.087 --> 26:01.087
I'll live.

26:01.154 --> 26:02.421
Okay.

26:02.489 --> 26:05.625
- Can I have one of these?
- Sure.

26:08.362 --> 26:10.296
So, Eliot, you want to tell me what happened

26:10.364 --> 26:12.798
with Eleanor Nacht?

26:12.866 --> 26:14.000
There's not much to tell.

26:14.067 --> 26:15.267
Order came down from Langley.

26:15.269 --> 26:16.535
CIA, yeah.

26:16.603 --> 26:18.483
That's not what I'm asking about.

26:19.439 --> 26:21.707
Where is she?

26:21.775 --> 26:25.211
Some off-site holding facility,
as far as I know.

26:25.279 --> 26:26.946
And you're sure about that?

26:27.014 --> 26:29.715
I am unless you know something I don't.

26:29.783 --> 26:32.885
I got a bad feeling about this.

26:32.953 --> 26:35.655
Well, it's out of your jurisdiction, Hank.

26:35.722 --> 26:37.123
We're managing things.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.858
You're not managing shit.

26:38.926 --> 26:40.159
Okay.

26:40.227 --> 26:41.594
I think that CIA guy

26:41.662 --> 26:43.129
is calling the shots, not you.

26:43.196 --> 26:45.564
As a matter of fact,
if I didn't know better, I'd say

26:45.632 --> 26:48.034
you're doing a whole lot of catching,
not a lot of pitching.

26:48.101 --> 26:50.002
What's your point?

26:50.070 --> 26:53.005
The CIA put Eleanor back on the street,

26:53.073 --> 26:56.384
and either you don't know jack
shit about it or you're in on it.

26:56.410 --> 26:59.145
Which is it?

26:59.212 --> 27:01.314
Don't take my word for it.
Why don't you call 'em up,

27:01.381 --> 27:02.648
find out where Eleanor is.

27:02.716 --> 27:05.718
Off-site holding facility, my ass.

27:05.786 --> 27:09.255
Hey, I'm not taking orders
from some shit-kicking local.

27:09.323 --> 27:11.590
You're the one who walked into
an ambush with Agent McKenzie,

27:11.658 --> 27:12.959
who I'll remind you

27:13.026 --> 27:14.593
was conducting an illegal investigation.

27:14.661 --> 27:16.495
- He was right.
- Yeah.

27:16.563 --> 27:18.564
And now he's dead.

27:24.438 --> 27:26.172
You call 'em up.

27:26.239 --> 27:27.340
Go on.

27:27.407 --> 27:28.674
You find out where Eleanor is.

27:28.742 --> 27:30.676
And when you do, Eliot, you call me,

27:30.744 --> 27:33.512
and I'll help you unscrew
your head from out your ass.

27:33.580 --> 27:35.414
Ah...

28:54.570 --> 28:55.671
No.

29:12.232 --> 29:13.833
No.

29:14.308 --> 29:16.576
No, Obregon.

29:41.302 --> 29:42.903
If this is about your daughter...

29:42.970 --> 29:44.905
What are you doing about it?

29:44.972 --> 29:46.506
Everything I can.

29:46.574 --> 29:48.041
We've reached out to the Marines.

29:48.109 --> 29:49.676
We're getting traction.

29:49.744 --> 29:53.180
If they move on Fausto, he will kill her.

29:53.247 --> 29:54.781
You know that.

29:54.849 --> 29:57.751
That's not going to happen, Sebastian.

29:57.819 --> 30:01.288
They're in contact with Fausto.

30:01.355 --> 30:04.157
Detective Ruiz is there.

30:04.225 --> 30:05.525
Why?

30:05.593 --> 30:07.194
We don't know.

30:07.261 --> 30:09.029
We're looking into it.

30:12.166 --> 30:16.336
Just remember the Americans
need me for the transition.

30:16.404 --> 30:18.338
I want my daughter back

30:18.406 --> 30:20.040
and Fausto dead.

30:20.108 --> 30:22.509
We all want that.

30:23.815 --> 30:28.448
Now, go back and comfort your
wife in this difficult time.

30:28.516 --> 30:31.218
I got this.

30:38.592 --> 30:41.227
<i>Por favor.</i>

30:41.796 --> 30:44.397
Fausto.

30:48.675 --> 30:50.108
No.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.934
Detective Ruiz.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.142
<i>Sí.</i>

34:33.513 --> 34:36.482
Hi there.

34:37.230 --> 34:39.114
Can I ask you a question?

34:39.141 --> 34:40.741
Okay.

34:41.601 --> 34:44.366
- You ever seen this woman?
- Um...

34:46.125 --> 34:47.926
No.

34:49.143 --> 34:50.643
What about this man?

34:52.179 --> 34:55.447
Uh, no, but, um, there was a guy out here

34:55.516 --> 34:58.151
asking the same thing, uh, not too long ago.

34:58.219 --> 34:59.919
Really?

35:01.122 --> 35:02.522
Big guy?

35:02.590 --> 35:03.556
Cop, I think, um...

35:03.624 --> 35:05.158
Talked to my dad about the trucks.

35:05.226 --> 35:06.626
What trucks?

35:06.694 --> 35:08.161
At the crossroad.

35:08.229 --> 35:10.230
They come at night.

35:12.022 --> 35:14.108
Come on, Bobby.

35:14.134 --> 35:14.906
No.

35:14.981 --> 35:16.582
Talk to me, please.

35:16.649 --> 35:18.684
You still owe me 12
bucks when you stiffed me

35:18.751 --> 35:20.786
at Chi-Chi's, Frye. Up yours.

35:20.854 --> 35:21.887
I do?

35:21.955 --> 35:23.021
We had daiquiris.

35:23.089 --> 35:25.057
Tammy the coke fiend was there.

35:25.124 --> 35:26.558
Incident by the dartboard.

35:26.626 --> 35:30.162
Tammy. The coke fiend. She was fun.

35:30.230 --> 35:32.064
What's she doing these days, huh?

35:32.131 --> 35:34.433
She's a Christian now.
Selling shoes at the mall.

35:34.501 --> 35:35.634
Shame.

35:35.702 --> 35:37.703
That's a waste.

35:40.673 --> 35:42.674
Off a job.

35:48.106 --> 35:49.346
Hey.

35:49.415 --> 35:51.416
Keep the change.

35:56.890 --> 35:58.790
Where did you get this?

35:58.858 --> 36:00.759
At a crossroads in the desert

36:00.827 --> 36:03.328
about 40 miles from here.
We figure it's a forgery.

36:03.396 --> 36:05.764
- No, it's not.
- Interesting.

36:05.832 --> 36:07.165
Where does someone get something like that?

36:07.233 --> 36:09.902
Only from us. We print 'em here.

36:09.969 --> 36:12.548
Big companies get
'em to make the border crossing easier.

36:12.574 --> 36:14.006
- How easy?
- Well,

36:14.073 --> 36:15.553
Border Patrol won't search the trucks.

36:15.575 --> 36:16.875
It's a NAFTA thing.

36:16.943 --> 36:18.777
Can Mexican companies get the stickers, too?

36:18.845 --> 36:20.946
American or Mexican. It's a process.

36:21.014 --> 36:23.282
You got a list of those companies?

36:23.349 --> 36:26.151
You got a hundred bucks, I got a list.

36:29.322 --> 36:31.842
I need to go to the ATM first.

40:08.237 --> 40:10.603
Hey,<i> capitán.</i>

41:30.670 --> 41:32.271
So, uh,

41:32.297 --> 41:35.632
kid said the trucks come every night?

41:35.658 --> 41:37.092
Pretty much.

41:39.228 --> 41:41.630
Drug Enforcement...

41:41.697 --> 41:43.665
will not admit that they got outflanked

41:43.733 --> 41:46.501
by the Central Intelligence
Agency with Eleanor.

41:46.569 --> 41:48.670
That's what this is all about.

41:48.738 --> 41:51.039
It's just a pissing contest.

41:51.107 --> 41:54.158
That reporter's right... this is all dirty.

41:54.415 --> 41:56.049
It's all dirty.

41:56.117 --> 41:58.351
I still can't believe it.

41:58.419 --> 42:01.288
Our government cooperating with the cartel?

42:01.355 --> 42:04.357
Not saying it's right,
but I guess it happens.

42:05.893 --> 42:08.095
You know, it's always struck
me as strange that,

42:08.162 --> 42:10.397
well, we get about five murders a year,

42:10.465 --> 42:12.265
give or take a few, in El Paso

42:12.333 --> 42:13.767
as long as I've been around.

42:13.835 --> 42:16.403
And given what's going on across the border,

42:16.471 --> 42:18.939
it just doesn't feel right. It's...

42:20.575 --> 42:22.576
And some of that's on us.

42:24.278 --> 42:25.545
Cops?

42:27.648 --> 42:30.083
No, Americans.

42:39.534 --> 42:41.435
Here we go.

42:45.111 --> 42:46.351
What the hell?

42:48.871 --> 42:50.872
They're switching drivers.

42:53.241 --> 42:54.474
Let's take them.

42:54.542 --> 42:57.144
You take the van. I got the semi.

42:57.211 --> 42:58.645
Be careful.

42:58.713 --> 43:00.780
