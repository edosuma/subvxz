TWO PEOPLE GOT KILLED, DAD,
AND HE SHOT ME.

28:48.309 --> 28:49.394
WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:49.394 --> 28:50.979
LIEUTENANT RODRIGUEZ.

28:50.979 --> 28:52.063
MARK GAMBLE.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.440
YOU RAISED A FINE SON.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.401
DAD, I HAD TO PLAY DEAD
SO HE WOULDN'T KILL ME.

28:56.401 --> 28:58.236
CAN I TAKE HIM HOME NOW?

28:58.236 --> 29:00.947
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT
A SECOND, JEFF?

29:03.616 --> 29:05.368
JEFF SAW A DOUBLE MURDER.

29:05.368 --> 29:09.038
HE STEPPED UP
AND I.D.ed THE SHOOTER.

29:09.038 --> 29:10.457
GLAD HE COULD HELP.

29:10.457 --> 29:13.376
HE GOT GRAZED HIMSELF,
SO HE'S TRAUMATIZED.

29:13.376 --> 29:16.629
IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE HE CALMS DOWN.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.340
HE'S FINE.

29:19.340 --> 29:20.925
NO, HE'S STILL
A LITTLE SHAKEN UP.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.302
YOU MEAN, NOT ALL THERE?

29:22.302 --> 29:23.636
YEAH.

29:23.636 --> 29:26.097
HE FRIED HIS BRAIN OUT
SNIFFING GLUE WHEN HE WAS 16.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.474
THAT'S ALL YOU'RE GONNA GET.

29:27.474 --> 29:30.643
ASK HIM WHAT DAY IT IS.
GO AHEAD.

29:38.359 --> 29:42.238
JEFF, WHAT DAY IS IT TODAY?

29:42.238 --> 29:43.281
FUN DAY.

29:43.281 --> 29:45.533
BUT WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK
IS IT?

29:45.533 --> 29:46.951
MONDAY, TUESDAY...

29:51.956 --> 29:53.500
OH, MAN.

29:55.668 --> 29:57.504
CAN I TAKE HIM HOME NOW?

29:57.504 --> 29:59.839
SURE. WE'LL GET IN TOUCH
IF WE NEED ANYTHING.

30:06.763 --> 30:09.307
YOU GOT A SECOND?

30:16.940 --> 30:20.235
IF IT SOUNDED LIKE I'M UNAWARE
OF YOUR PART IN THIS

30:20.235 --> 30:23.363
OR THAT I DON'T CARE,
THEN I CAME ACROSS WRONG.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.614
HOW SHOULD I TAKE IT?

30:24.614 --> 30:26.866
I'M WAITING EACH DAY,
TOTALLY OUT OF THE LOOP,

30:26.866 --> 30:29.494
WHILE YOU DECIDE WHETHER
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP OUR KID.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.165
CAN YOU JUST
BE THERE FOR ME?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.546
YEAH.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.674
ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

30:57.438 --> 30:59.858
YOU GOT PICKED OUT, GIO.

30:59.858 --> 31:01.067
SO?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.652
COME ON, SIT DOWN.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.698
GONNA GIVE YOU YOUR CHANCE
TO TALK ABOUT IT NOW.

31:06.698 --> 31:10.326
I THOUGHT IF I GOT PICKED OUT
I WASN'T GONNA GET<i> ANY </i>CHANCES.

31:10.326 --> 31:12.328
THAT MUST HAVE CHANGED,
I GUESS, HUH?

31:12.328 --> 31:13.788
WHAT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S NAME

31:13.788 --> 31:16.040
WHO ASSAULTED ME AT THE
APARTMENT -- LISA?

31:16.040 --> 31:17.333
ASSAULTED YOU? COME ON.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.919
THE LITTLE GIRL --
IS SHE YOU AND LISA'S DAUGHTER?

31:19.919 --> 31:21.004
YEAH.

31:21.004 --> 31:22.338
WHAT YOUR DAUGHTER'S NAME?

31:22.338 --> 31:23.715
HAYLEY.

31:23.715 --> 31:25.508
LISA A GOOD MOM TO HAYLEY?

31:27.719 --> 31:29.387
YOU LOVE YOUR DAUGHTER?

31:29.387 --> 31:32.473
YOU WANT LISA TO CONTINUE
BEING HER MOM?

31:32.473 --> 31:36.060
YOU'RE NOT ACTUALLY BRINGING
MY DAUGHTER INTO THIS, ARE YOU?

31:36.060 --> 31:37.770
WE GOT YOU RESISTING ARREST

31:37.770 --> 31:40.189
AND HOLDING AN UNLICENSED
FIREARM.

31:40.189 --> 31:42.901
WE GOT LISA LOCKED UP
FOR ASSAULTING ME.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.235
AND IF THAT AIN'T ENOUGH,

31:44.235 --> 31:46.446
I'LL NOTIFY
THE BUREAU OF CHILD WELFARE

31:46.446 --> 31:48.907
WITH ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE
ON BOTH YOU AND LISA

31:48.907 --> 31:50.116
AGAINST YOUR DAUGHTER,

31:50.116 --> 31:51.993
AND HAYLEY WILL BE IN
FOSTER CARE

31:51.993 --> 31:55.246
BY THE END OF BUSINESS TODAY,
AND SHE WILL STAY IN THE SYSTEM,

31:55.246 --> 31:57.707
AND NEITHER ONE OF YOU WILL EVER
GET HER BACK.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.335
WE KNOW YOU KILLED
TWO PEOPLE TODAY, GIO.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.712
YOU MADE YOUR MOVE.
WE'LL MAKE OURS.

32:02.712 --> 32:04.297
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.506
WATCH ME.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.800
THE ONLY WAY YOUR DAUGHTER
STAYS OUT OF THIS IS

32:07.800 --> 32:09.969
BY YOU TELLING US
WHAT WENT WRONG TODAY.

32:09.969 --> 32:12.639
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WON'T GO
AFTER HER IF I DO TALK?

32:12.639 --> 32:14.682
ALL WE CARE ABOUT
IS THE TWO GUYS THAT YOU KILLED.

32:14.682 --> 32:17.852
ONCE THAT'S TIED UP, LISA GETS
RELEASED AND TAKES HAYLEY HOME.

32:21.272 --> 32:23.858
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:23.858 --> 32:25.944
I EAT THERE.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.403
THE OWNER DON'T MAKE
THE BANK DROP

32:27.403 --> 32:28.738
TILL THE NEXT DAY.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.573
I GOT DEBTS.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.952
KID AT THE REGISTER --
NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE --

32:33.952 --> 32:36.371
STARTS SCREAMING,
FREAKING OUT.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.705
WOULDN'T GIVE IT UP.

32:37.705 --> 32:38.831
I WAS HIGH.

32:38.831 --> 32:42.168
I GOT PISSED OFF.
IT GOT OUT OF HAND.

32:42.168 --> 32:44.087
WRITE IT DOWN.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.091
DID JULIAN GIVE ME UP?

32:48.091 --> 32:50.468
JULIAN SOMEBODY IN ON THIS
WITH YOU?

32:50.468 --> 32:51.970
JUST SOME GUY I KNOW.

32:51.970 --> 32:55.223
BUT THE ONLY GUY WHO KNEW
I WAS PLANNING ON DOING IT.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.558
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE
NOW, RIGHT?

32:57.558 --> 32:59.811
I DID THE RIGHT THING
AND COPPED TO IT.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.355
JUST TELL ME IF IT WAS HIM
WHO GAVE ME UP.

33:02.355 --> 33:05.358
I DON'T KNOW NO JULIAN.

33:05.358 --> 33:07.819
WHAT'S UP?

33:07.819 --> 33:09.153
TELL US AGAIN

33:09.153 --> 33:11.906
HOW YOU CAME TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THE MURDERS TODAY.

33:11.906 --> 33:14.534
I TOLD YOU ALL THIS ALREADY.

33:14.534 --> 33:16.619
STAY AWAY FROM ME!

33:16.619 --> 33:17.745
I MEAN IT!

33:17.745 --> 33:18.871
GIO WAS SAYING

33:18.871 --> 33:21.207
THAT HE TOLD YOU ABOUT IT
BEFORE IT WENT DOWN.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.291
WELL, HE'S LYING.

33:22.291 --> 33:23.543
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT --

33:23.543 --> 33:25.878
ONE DAY WE WAS SITTING AROUND
BETWEEN RACES

33:25.878 --> 33:27.880
TALKING ABOUT
OUR DREAM SCORES --

33:27.880 --> 33:29.215
YOU KNOW, LIKE GUYS DO.

33:29.215 --> 33:31.217
AND ONE OF THE DOZEN
OR SO PLACES

33:31.217 --> 33:33.469
THAT HE TALKED ABOUT
WAS LUPE'S CANTINA,

33:33.469 --> 33:35.471
BECAUSE HE NOTICED
THAT THE OWNER

33:35.471 --> 33:37.974
DIDN'T DO THE BANK DROP
UNTIL THE NEXT DAY.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.684
WHEN I HEARD LUPE'S
HAD GOTTEN HIT

33:39.684 --> 33:41.769
AND TWO GUYS WERE DEAD,
I CAME RIGHT DOWN.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.938
SO, YOU LIED ABOUT SEEING HIM
TODAY?

33:43.938 --> 33:46.566
NO, I DID SEE HIM TODAY,
AND HE WAS FREAKED,

33:46.566 --> 33:48.693
AND I DID ASK HIM
IF HE HIT LUPE'S.

33:48.693 --> 33:50.069
I DID NOT LIE ABOUT THAT.

33:50.069 --> 33:51.821
YOU SEE...

33:51.821 --> 33:54.949
THE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOWING ABOUT
A CRIME<i> BEFORE </i>IT HAPPENS!

33:54.949 --> 33:57.910
HE MENTIONED ONE DAY
THAT IT WOULD BE AN EASY SCORE.

33:57.910 --> 34:00.955
HE DIDN'T TELL ME WHAT DAY OR
WHAT TIME HE WAS GONNA DO IT.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.666
AND HE SURE DIDN'T SAY
THAT HE WAS GONNA TAKE OUT

34:03.666 --> 34:05.877
EVERYBODY IN THE PLACE
WHEN HE DID IT!

34:05.877 --> 34:08.546
IF I FIND OUT THAT YOU KNEW
MORE THAN YOU'RE SAYING...

34:08.546 --> 34:10.006
I DON'T!

34:14.510 --> 34:16.012
AND HERE I AM THINKING

34:16.012 --> 34:19.098
THAT I'M GONNA GET AN ACCOLADE
OR SOMETHING FROM YOU GUYS

34:19.098 --> 34:20.099

34:20.099 --> 34:21.392

34:21.392 --> 34:24.395
AM I GONNA GET THE REWARD MONEY
THAT IS RIGHTFULLY MINE?

34:24.395 --> 34:26.647
WE'LL GET IN TOUCH
WITH THE OWNER'S ATTORNEY.

34:26.647 --> 34:28.775
HE MAY WANT US
TO DEAL WITH YOU DIRECTLY.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.859

34:29.859 --> 34:30.902
THAT'S RIGHT.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.987
AND THE $2,000
FROM CRIMESTOPPERS?

34:32.987 --> 34:35.531
YOU'LL GET THAT, ALL RIGHT,
IN A DAY OR TWO.

34:35.531 --> 34:37.325

34:37.325 --> 34:40.119

WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

OF MY NAME

34:57.929 --> 34:59.263

THEY CUT THE CHECKS?

34:59.263 --> 35:01.474

35:09.440 --> 35:11.901
EACH WORD OUT OF YOUR MOUTH
FROM HERE ON OUT IS

35:11.901 --> 35:14.028
AN EXTRA WEEK
TILL YOU GET THE CHECKS.

35:14.028 --> 35:17.698

TO A SILENT ALARM,

35:47.145 --> 35:48.563
BUT THE PERP ALREADY BOOGIED.

35:48.563 --> 35:49.605
SHE'S NOT A COP.

35:49.605 --> 35:50.606

35:50.606 --> 35:52.483
THE OWNER
WAS GETTING STUCK UP.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.910

38:44.488 --> 38:46.365
AND YOU BETTER MAKE
AN APPOINTMENT

38:46.365 --> 38:48.951
TO PLAY PIANO AT THE
KING SOLOMON HOME FOR THE AGED.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.287
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SIGNED ANYTHING?

38:51.287 --> 38:52.288
THERE'S NO MAIL COMING IN.

38:52.288 --> 38:53.497
BECAUSE OF THE ANTHRAX.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.957
WHO TOLD YOU THIS -- CORY?

38:54.957 --> 38:56.417
YOU'RE MAKING ME VERY UPSET!

38:56.417 --> 38:57.877
GOOD, YOU NEED TO BE.

38:57.877 --> 39:00.129
YOU NEED TO STEP UP

39:00.129 --> 39:03.632
AND TAKE ACCOUNT
OF YOUR FINANCES, YOUR LIFE.

39:03.632 --> 39:05.593
AND YOU NEED TO GO SIT
BY THE DOOR.

LOOKING INTO THIS?

YOUR CHANCES, HUH?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.098
OH, JUST GO AHEAD THEN!

39:19.398 --> 39:21.776
SO I SAID, "GO AHEAD,
TAKE YOUR SHOT."

39:21.776 --> 39:22.777
EVEN THOUGH I KNOW
WHAT'S COMING,

39:22.777 --> 39:24.236
WHEN I HEAR "260,"

39:24.236 --> 39:27.406
STILL, IT'S NOT INSULTING,
BUT IT'S DISCOURAGING.

RIGHT.

WOMAN IN

OFFICER.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.891

SHE GOT SHOT IN A STICKUP.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.810
HMM.

39:55.810 --> 39:58.771
SHE WAS A REAL SAD CASE.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.189
WAS SHE REALLY NUTS?

40:00.189 --> 40:02.149
I GUESS.

40:02.149 --> 40:03.901
I IMAGINE SHE WAS
HEADING FOR TROUBLE,

40:03.901 --> 40:05.027
DRESSING LIKE A COP.

40:05.027 --> 40:07.738
YEAH, BUT SHE MIGHT
HAVE BEEN OKAY

DIFFERENTLY.

RIGHT?

40:13.619 --> 40:14.620

40:26.632 --> 40:28.426
GIVEN A FEW
DIFFERENT JUDGMENT CALLS

40:28.426 --> 40:29.802
MIGHT HAVE REALLY CHANGED

40:29.802 --> 40:32.096
THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT
TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.183
