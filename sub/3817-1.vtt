00:49.549 --> 00:51.117
- Okay. Are we doing...
- Hi.

00:51.217 --> 00:52.852
- How are you?
- I'm not comin' out there.

00:52.952 --> 00:56.056
It's only a day and a half of work,
and you gonna be making $150.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.658
- I look like a damn fool.
- I'm gonna come in.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.429
Okay. One, two, thre...

01:02.028 --> 01:03.496
You better stop it.

01:03.596 --> 01:06.766
Eileen, you come in on three.
You don't say, "One, two," and come in.

01:06.866 --> 01:08.401
You say, "Three." Then you come in.

01:08.501 --> 01:13.206
Look at you. You are
dressed for success.

01:13.306 --> 01:15.308
I look like the whole
damn red-light district.

01:15.408 --> 01:17.644
I ain't had nothing like this
on since I was on that pole.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.815
Ooh. Well, just think of this as
another pole. The North Pole.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.616
They don't make it
rain at the North Pole.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.518
At my age, I can't
get no rain nowhere.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.998
I get a little drizzle,
but them quarters hurt.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.625
No, no, no. Well, this is beautiful.

01:32.725 --> 01:35.962
Just think of this as a little
extra money for you and Cora.

01:36.062 --> 01:37.764
Honey, I don't buy Cora
nothing for Christmas.

01:37.864 --> 01:39.666
I ain't bought her nothing
since she was seven years old.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.101
- You're kidding.
- That's right.

01:41.201 --> 01:44.037
Cora asked me for some money
for some dolls named Starz.

01:44.137 --> 01:45.972
I couldn't afford it.
She just wanted them Starz.

01:46.072 --> 01:48.041
So all day Christmas,
she made me feel bad.

01:48.141 --> 01:50.377
That night, Christmas dinner,
she's still sitting at the table crying.

01:50.477 --> 01:53.013
I knocked the hell out of her.
You know what happened?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.682
She saw stars. And she never
asked me for another gift.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.984
- You are dreadful. Yes, you are.
- The truth.

01:58.084 --> 02:00.820
- I can't do this, Eileen.
- Yes, you can. Stop.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.389
- Now, just smile.
- Okay. I'm smiling.

02:02.489 --> 02:04.457
Now, you should see...
Come over here.

02:04.557 --> 02:06.026
I gotta take you where you working.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.429
You should see the lovely gifts
I bought for my daughter.

02:09.529 --> 02:11.865
- How she doing?
- Oh, she is excellent.

02:11.965 --> 02:14.034
You know she went to New
York to get a degree...

02:14.134 --> 02:17.871
got her master's and up and
moved to Alabama of all places.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.573
- What the hell she move to Alabama for?
- Who knows.

02:20.673 --> 02:24.878
Anyway, she took a little job there in
some little, small school, you know.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.718
She says she wants to start a farm.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.685
- A farm? What she starting a farm for?
- I don't know. I don't know.

02:32.785 --> 02:36.222
But anyway, you know she got
tons of offers down here in Atlanta.

02:36.322 --> 02:38.958
But she didn't want to,
so what can you do?

02:39.058 --> 02:41.661
- Maybe she's trying to get away from you.
- You better stop that.

02:41.761 --> 02:43.530
- Where we going?
- My daughter loves me.

02:43.630 --> 02:47.735
Round yon Virgin Mother...

02:49.869 --> 02:52.449
- Was that you singing?
- No, ma'am.

02:52.872 --> 02:56.076
There's no one else in there,
Bailey McCoy.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.012
Come on. Walk with me.
You're late again.

02:59.112 --> 03:00.380
I'm sorry.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.715
- I'm gonna have to talk to your parents.
- No.

03:02.815 --> 03:06.319
I just woke up late.
I'll be here on time. I promise.

03:06.419 --> 03:07.887
Budget cuts, budget cuts.

03:07.987 --> 03:10.090
All right. Go on in class.

03:10.190 --> 03:12.092
- We'll talk about this later. Okay?
- Okay.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.431
And your singing.

03:17.630 --> 03:20.176
I'm not gonna come in
here and listen to this.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.511
All right, people!

03:27.340 --> 03:29.909
Now, we may have to cancel
the Christmas Jubilee this year.

03:30.009 --> 03:32.545
- No way!
- We don't have the budget!

03:32.645 --> 03:34.481
Mayor, you hold on right there.

03:34.581 --> 03:36.483
All right? Now, I grew
"poinsetters" for this.

03:36.583 --> 03:37.884
Poinsettias.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.688
- That's what I said.
- No, you didn't.

03:40.687 --> 03:42.455
If this Christmas
Jubilee don't happen...

03:42.555 --> 03:44.357
what am I gonna do with
all them "poinsetters"?

03:44.457 --> 03:46.759
- Poinsettias.
- Stop. Do I look stupid?

03:46.859 --> 03:48.761
- Tanner, I understand.
- No, sir...

03:48.861 --> 03:50.964
with all due respect,
I don't think you do.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.766
Since they built that dam upriver,
we've been barely surviving.

03:53.866 --> 03:56.069
Between that and the drought...

03:56.169 --> 03:58.104
managed to put most of
our crops out of business.

03:58.204 --> 04:00.106
We need this Christmas Jubilee
to happen. You hear me?

04:00.206 --> 04:03.143
We don't have the money.
I talked to the city council, didn't I?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.411
You did, Your Honor.
He talked to him. I heard him.

04:05.511 --> 04:08.848
- Take it out of the school.
- Hold on, Tanner McCoy.

04:08.948 --> 04:11.084
We've already cut
the school's budget...

04:11.184 --> 04:13.653
and as principal,
I have to draw the line.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.488
We have four teachers
teaching several classes.

04:16.589 --> 04:19.692
If we cut back more, we'll not be
able to finish the school year.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.562
I don't care.
Somebody has to do something.

04:22.662 --> 04:24.531
We have to have this
Christmas Jubilee.

04:24.631 --> 04:28.268
It helps too many people around here
make enough money just to stay open.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.303
We don't have the budget!

04:30.403 --> 04:34.144
When we elected you as mayor,
you said you would help us!

04:35.375 --> 04:37.977
I know. I'm sorry.

04:38.077 --> 04:41.981
Folks around here don't take too kindly
to politicians not keeping their word.

04:42.081 --> 04:45.958
You keep putting all these good people
against the wall and see what happens.

04:47.220 --> 04:49.189
Come on, fellas. Geez.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.369
- This is ridiculous.
- Absolutely.

04:56.162 --> 04:58.242
- You believe that guy?
- That was unpleasant.

04:58.731 --> 05:00.266
Yes, it was.

05:00.366 --> 05:02.068
- This is where you'll be working.
- Okay.

05:02.168 --> 05:04.003
Okay? Have you ever
done sales before?

05:04.103 --> 05:07.874
- Yes, I sold trees.
- Christmas trees?

05:07.974 --> 05:09.943
When you smoke 'em, they make
you feel like it's Christmas.

05:10.043 --> 05:12.011
If you don't stop that nasty talk.

05:12.111 --> 05:14.180
Stop it. I mean,
where goods were exchanged.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.282
I was exchanging my
goodies back in the day.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.817
Yes, indeed.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.997
- I got to bring...
- On the black market.

05:21.554 --> 05:24.624
- I got to bring you back to church.
- You ain't bringing me to no church.

05:24.724 --> 05:27.060
I ain't goin' to no church.
The devil is a lie.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.195
- And you still married to him.
- Honey, honey...

05:29.295 --> 05:31.264
- Speak of the devil, listen. Listen.
- What, what, what?

05:31.364 --> 05:33.499
- Y'all want me to work the register?
- No, no.

05:33.599 --> 05:35.068
- Other people take...
- You sure?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.970
You have to be bonded for that job.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.972
If I took the register,
I'd be bonded out.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.840
Okay. Yeah. No, no, no, no.

05:40.940 --> 05:44.744
Listen, let's go over a little quick
review of what you're supposed to do.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.647
- You teach me.
- You're supposed to direct the customers...

05:47.747 --> 05:50.583
when they ask you for something,
and you can refer to this.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.852
Okay? Now,
kitchenware is on the fifth floor.

05:52.952 --> 05:54.420
- Kitchenware, fifth floor.
- Yes.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.422
- Women's apparel is on the second...
- Y'all sell pears?

05:56.522 --> 05:58.391
Y'all got produce up there?

05:58.491 --> 06:00.994
- Clothing. Women's clothing.
- Say, "Clothing." Don't say, "A pears."

06:01.094 --> 06:02.829
I don't know what
"apparels" is. "A pears."

06:02.929 --> 06:05.131
Okay. Young adults
is on the third floor.

06:05.231 --> 06:09.002
- Young adults on the third floor.
- Makeup and perfume is here.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.603
And over there across the hall.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.939
- I get it. I'll be fine.
- All right, and listen.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.775
Most important,
everybody gets the same greeting.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.044
When they come in,
you look them in the face...

06:18.144 --> 06:21.881
you smile pretty and you say,
"Merry Christmas.

06:21.981 --> 06:24.250
It's a beautiful day at Tifton's.

06:24.350 --> 06:27.754
Joy to you and yours.
Yes, may I help you?"

06:27.854 --> 06:29.656
That what I say?
Fine. I will say that.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.025
- You wanna go over it once?
- All right.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.927
- Here's a customer. Okay.
- Can you help me?

06:35.027 --> 06:36.663
- Yes. Merry...
- Yes.

06:36.763 --> 06:38.331
Mary had a little...

06:38.431 --> 06:40.400
- No, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

06:40.500 --> 06:43.569
- It's a beautiful day at Tip...
- Tifton's.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.905
- Tap... Tip... Tiptoes.
- Joy to you.

06:46.005 --> 06:48.608
Joy to the world and the Lord
is come, and happy Easter.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.177
What can... What can I
do for you at Tifton's?

06:51.277 --> 06:53.357
Thank you. I'm looking
for women's lingerie.

06:54.046 --> 06:56.582
Honey? Who the lingerie for?

06:56.682 --> 06:58.420
For me, of course.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.788
I don't know about you
wearing the lingeries.

07:01.888 --> 07:05.291
Those days are over, honey.
Somebody should've told you it's passed.

07:05.391 --> 07:08.161
The lingeries is for young
people with tight, firm stuff.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.630
What I would suggest you do, hunty...

07:10.730 --> 07:13.499
I would suggest you walk
across the street to Target...

07:13.599 --> 07:18.237
and ask them for some of those
really nice big, big-girl drawers...

07:18.337 --> 07:20.239
so that you will be comfortable.

07:20.339 --> 07:22.275
You don't wanna walk around
with a slingshot up your butt.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.876
- Eileen!
- Come, come, come.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.445
Come. Let me help you.

07:25.545 --> 07:27.347
- You are so rude!
- She's something.

07:27.447 --> 07:31.484
No, you are the one that's rude
anytime you bring lingerie to a man.

07:31.584 --> 07:34.587
Who was the 37th president
of the United States?

07:34.687 --> 07:36.266
I know.

07:40.059 --> 07:41.638
Bailey, do you know?

07:44.263 --> 07:45.732
I know the answer.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.901
I didn't ask you. I asked Bailey.

07:49.001 --> 07:52.271
He don't know. He's always dirty.

07:52.371 --> 07:54.807
And he's just a farm boy.

07:54.907 --> 08:00.246
Yes, but he's the only one to get
an A on all three of his last tests.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.648
What did you get, Lucy?

08:02.748 --> 08:04.250
Or you, Larry?

08:04.350 --> 08:06.760
There will be no
bullying in this class.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.757
I'll see you all tomorrow.
Do your homework.

08:10.857 --> 08:13.359
Look over the list of songs
for the Christmas Jubilee.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.362
Christmas is five days away.

08:16.462 --> 08:18.508
Hold on a second, Bailey.

08:24.637 --> 08:27.774
You gotta start speaking up
and participating in class.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.609
I know you knew the answer.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.010
You're are so smart and talented.

08:32.111 --> 08:36.215
You get an A on every test.
You gotta believe in yourself.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.885
Lucy's right.
I'm just an old farm boy.

08:41.153 --> 08:43.655
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

08:43.756 --> 08:47.065
You are smart. You can
be anything you want.

08:48.494 --> 08:51.731
I can only imagine if you could
just stay awake in class.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.467
- Are you up late at night?
- No, ma'am.

08:54.567 --> 08:58.205
I want you to sing the lead
solo at the Christmas Jubilee.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.073
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

09:01.173 --> 09:03.583
- Yes, you can.
- No.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.651
You know what? I really
gotta go, Miss Williams.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.591
My daddy's gonna be
waiting for me at home.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.090
Go on.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.332
Hello?

09:26.432 --> 09:28.434
I don't hear from you in six years...

09:28.534 --> 09:31.804
and you call me out of the
blue because you need my help.

09:31.904 --> 09:33.473
Don't blame that on me.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.409
You're the one who married Kelly
and stopped returning my calls.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.177
You're not still bitter, are you?

09:38.277 --> 09:40.789
Maybe. How is she?

09:41.781 --> 09:44.555
I don't know. We're divorced.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.386
Good. She was such a tramp.

09:47.486 --> 09:51.023
I can't believe you married her and
dumped me. That's what you get.

09:51.123 --> 09:53.192
Okay, okay.

09:53.292 --> 09:56.128
Hey, pull up, It was high school.
Am I forgiven?

09:56.228 --> 09:59.765
That depends. Can you help
me with my school situation?

09:59.865 --> 10:02.702
- So you need sponsorship?
- Yes.

10:02.802 --> 10:04.770
A call came in just as I
was leaving a meeting..

10:04.870 --> 10:07.607
With a company that's in
the middle of a PR nightmare.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.942
They could use some
goodwill right now.

10:10.042 --> 10:13.779
Actually, in a town like yours.
So your timing may be perfect.

10:13.879 --> 10:15.515
Tell me about it.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.451
Can't do that until
we have a contract.

10:18.551 --> 10:22.221
- You don't trust me?
- No, no, no, it's not that.

10:22.321 --> 10:24.526
I have to protect my
interests, that's all.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.260
Tell you what.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.595
I'll come down with a contract,
you get your people to sign...

10:29.695 --> 10:31.364
and I'm sure I can pull in...

10:31.464 --> 10:34.408
at least a hundred grand for
your school and its event.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.904
$100,000. That would be great.

10:38.004 --> 10:39.906
How soon can you get here?

10:40.006 --> 10:41.774
You need the money
right away, don't you?

10:41.874 --> 10:44.577
Yeah. So you're willing
to drive down to Alabama?

10:44.677 --> 10:47.113
I will drive over tomorrow.

10:47.213 --> 10:49.615
We'll get the contract signed,
then I'll have to leave...

10:49.715 --> 10:52.552
but I'll be back for the event.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.732
That would be fantastic.

10:55.688 --> 10:58.057
Oliver, thank you so much.

10:58.157 --> 10:59.292
See you soon.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.493
- You got it.
- Bye.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.866
Child, that Powerball is going up.

11:05.965 --> 11:09.168
Hello? Hey, I need y'all to
go get me some scratch-offs.

11:09.268 --> 11:11.170
- Yeah, and play the numbers for me.
- Can you help me?

11:11.270 --> 11:12.772
That Powerball has
gotten really high.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.173
Play number 22...

11:14.273 --> 11:16.242
- Excuse me.
- 17,5 and 6.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.145
Go play them numbers, and bring
me a bunch of scratch offs. Yeah.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.714
Just two, three of 'em.
Don't spend a lot of money.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.049
I need some help!

11:23.149 --> 11:24.951
Hold on, 'cause somebody's
screaming at me.

11:25.051 --> 11:27.131
I'm getting ready to
choke her. Hold on.

11:29.488 --> 11:32.158
Lady, you gonna need a damn
doctor if you holler at me again.

11:32.258 --> 11:35.027
Do you understand?
Now, what can I help you with?

11:35.127 --> 11:37.029
- I need a watch for my husband.
- A men's watch.

11:37.129 --> 11:40.266
A men's watch. You know,
I like it with a leather band.

11:40.366 --> 11:42.768
- You know, a nice thin watch.
- Here are some men's...

11:42.868 --> 11:44.971
Oh, hell. It's time for my break.

11:45.071 --> 11:46.906
- Time for my break.
- Break?

11:47.006 --> 11:48.474
No, wait.

11:48.574 --> 11:50.042
- You're so rude.
- Bye, bye, bye.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.878
- You rude as hell. You rude as hell.
- Please. I need a watch.

11:52.978 --> 11:55.348
Get out of my way. I'm trying
to go to the break room.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.526
Wait! Come back!

12:00.886 --> 12:02.465
You still here?

12:03.255 --> 12:05.024
He called me back.

12:05.124 --> 12:07.204
Yeah? And?

12:08.127 --> 12:12.832
He thinks he can get us
$100,000 in sponsorship money.

12:12.932 --> 12:14.767
$100,000?

12:14.867 --> 12:17.103
- Oh, my goodness, that would be so great.
- I know.

12:17.203 --> 12:19.438
That would not only
pay for the Jubilee...

12:19.538 --> 12:22.241
that would take us well into
next year's school year.

12:22.341 --> 12:24.677
We could get new books,
maybe even a new computer.

12:24.777 --> 12:27.580
Wait, calm down. It hasn't
happened yet. It's not done.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.349
Okay, but I have faith that it is.

12:30.449 --> 12:34.820
Lacey, thank you so much for
doing this. I really appreciate it.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.324
I know this school is not the best,
but it is all we got.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.860
And I know you could have gone
anywhere in the country...

12:40.960 --> 12:43.029
with the credentials you have.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.505
- I love it here.
- Thank you.

12:46.899 --> 12:48.968
He's coming down tomorrow
with the contract.

12:49.068 --> 12:51.937
This is so wonderful!
I gotta call the mayor.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.073
- Yes.
- He's gonna be so excited.

12:54.173 --> 12:56.275
This is going to be a wonderful
Christmas after all!

12:56.375 --> 12:57.954
It's gonna be fantastic.

13:00.212 --> 13:01.950
All right. I'll see you tomorrow.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.643
- Hello?
- I must be dialing the wrong number.

13:30.743 --> 13:33.713
You said that already,
but you called back five times.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.548
So what number you trying to get?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.983
I'm trying to reach
my daughter, Lacey.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.386
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
she just walked in. Hold on.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.566
- Who is that?
- Your mama.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.262
- Hi, Mama.
- Who was that?

13:50.362 --> 13:51.864
That was Conner.

13:51.964 --> 13:53.543
Conner?

13:54.300 --> 13:56.936
That's the guy you hired
to help you with the farm?

13:57.036 --> 13:58.738
Yeah, that's him.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.574
Okay. I don't know if I
like him up there with you.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.142
Suppose he gets fresh...

14:03.242 --> 14:05.544
and you don't have no man
up there to protect you.

14:05.644 --> 14:07.747
Mama, I'm fine. What's going on?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.282
I can't wait until you
taste the dinner...

14:10.382 --> 14:12.585
I have prepared for
you for Christmas.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.187
Yeah, I've been meaning
to talk to you about that.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.697
I'm not gonna be able
to come home this year.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.658
What?

14:19.758 --> 14:21.761
Uh-uh. It's Christmas.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.630
I know, it's just I'm just
getting settled in...

14:24.730 --> 14:26.799
and the farm needs a lot of work.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.301
Uh-uh. You not no
farmer in the dell now.

14:29.401 --> 14:30.870
It's not just the farm.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.172
They've also decided to
extended the school year...

14:33.272 --> 14:34.740
to the day before Christmas.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.610
- What kind of school is that?
- We lost a lot of days...

14:37.710 --> 14:40.746
because of the storms this summer,
so we have to make them up,

14:40.846 --> 14:43.115
And I'm helping the kids prepare
songs for the Christmas Jubilee.

14:43.215 --> 14:47.086
And we have a budget crisis.
So it's just too busy right now, Mom.

14:47.186 --> 14:48.087
I'll come up there.

14:48.187 --> 14:49.588
- No.
- Yes.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.657
- I haven't seen you in nine months...
- It's not the right time.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.659
And you don't drive.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.262
I can get somebody to
drive up there with me.

14:56.362 --> 14:58.631
I can ask your Aunt
Madea to come with me.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.901
Mama, can we just skip it this year?
It's only Christmas.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.469
You bite your tongue,

15:03.569 --> 15:05.838
Christmas is the time of year...

15:05.938 --> 15:10.282
when we celebrate the birth of
Jesus with our families and...

15:12.645 --> 15:14.613
Lacey, I don't have
to tell you that...

15:14.713 --> 15:17.416
you and I are the
only family we have,

15:17.516 --> 15:19.596
I know. Mom, are you crying?

15:21.954 --> 15:23.556
What was that, Conner?

15:24.323 --> 15:25.758
I didn't say anything.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.494
I'm sorry. Conner needs
my help, Mama. I gotta go.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.765
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
Love you Bye,

15:34.934 --> 15:37.903
Do not look at me like that.
You don't understand.

15:38.003 --> 15:39.878
I didn't say a word.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.279
Are you okay?

15:47.379 --> 15:51.417
Girl, I don't know why I let you talk
me into comin' and doin' this job.

15:51.517 --> 15:54.453
- I didn't take my medicine this morning.
- What medicine?

15:54.553 --> 15:56.758
Five milligrams
of "Don't choke that ho."

15:57.790 --> 15:59.692
These customers gettin' right...

15:59.792 --> 16:01.827
I feel I'm getting ready
to maybe catch a case.

16:01.927 --> 16:04.473
- I could spit.
- What's wrong with you?

16:04.897 --> 16:07.238
Lacey's not coming for Christmas.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.602
That ain't no problem.
Children grow up.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.570
They don't wanna come home sometimes.

16:11.670 --> 16:13.249
Something's wrong.

16:14.340 --> 16:15.474
- Eileen?
- What?

16:15.574 --> 16:18.678
I know that look in your eye.
Don't go jumpin' to no conclusion.

16:19.345 --> 16:21.513
I don't jump to conclusions.

16:21.613 --> 16:24.516
Last time you went to
the doctor, you had a rash.

16:24.616 --> 16:27.820
Walked up in there, told the man
you had cancer and you was dying.

16:27.920 --> 16:32.658
Madea, many people in my
family have died of cancer.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.693
- I know your family.
- Yes.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.162
- My grandmother.
- Got hit by a bus.

16:37.262 --> 16:41.267
But she had cancer. My uncle Bayrod.

16:41.367 --> 16:44.003
- Drowned.
- Because he had cancer.

16:44.103 --> 16:45.804
- Eileen?
- What?

16:45.904 --> 16:48.107
No, no, no, no. Something is wrong.

16:48.207 --> 16:50.843
Something is wrong with my child,
and I'm gonna find out what it is.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.779
She's down there in the country,
and I don't know what's going on.

16:53.879 --> 16:56.382
I haven't seen where she works,
where she live.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.951
- It's just awful!
- Your daughter is grown.

16:59.051 --> 17:01.954
Leave her alone. If she want to
come home, she will come home.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.633
What you planning on doing?

17:04.223 --> 17:05.691
I'm gonna go down there.

17:05.790 --> 17:08.193
I'd like to see that,
'cause you don't drive.

17:08.292 --> 17:11.262
- You do.
- Child, I ain't goin' to no Alabama.

17:11.363 --> 17:14.934
Last time I was in Alabama, I was chained
to Andy Young and Jesse Jackson.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.273
- You marched?
- We wasn't upright when we was marching.

17:20.305 --> 17:23.008
- We gonna go down there.
- I'm not driving to no Alabama.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.011
All my stuff is illegal. I don't
like driving through Georgia.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.314
You think I'm gettin' ready
to drive through Alabama?

17:28.414 --> 17:30.382
- I'll pay you.
- What time you wanna leave?

17:30.482 --> 17:32.484
Okay. Good.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.553
No, child. I can't get on
the road with my Cadillac.

17:34.653 --> 17:38.791
It's got 4,785,000 miles on it,
and I just changed the oil in it.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.859
Every light on the dashboard say...

17:40.959 --> 17:43.266
"You crazy as hell if
you go anywhere in me."

17:44.763 --> 17:48.000
- Madea...
- I can't do it, hon. I'm sorry.

17:48.100 --> 17:51.181
Have you ever thought maybe she
just don't want to see you, Eileen?

17:52.171 --> 17:54.006
My daughter loves me.

17:54.106 --> 17:57.009
She loves spending time with me.

17:57.109 --> 18:00.412
All right, honey. If you find a ride,
I'll go up there with you.

18:00.512 --> 18:03.024
All right. Well, I will work on it.

18:15.494 --> 18:17.005
Conner.

18:17.896 --> 18:20.632
- What the hell you think you're doin'?
- What are you talking about?

18:20.732 --> 18:22.534
I was down at the feed store.

18:22.634 --> 18:24.670
They tell me you're planning
on planting corn this year.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.305
Yeah, I was.

18:26.405 --> 18:28.540
I plant corn.

18:28.640 --> 18:31.310
Well, actually, what I'm
working on can help all of us.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.479
- What you're working on?
- Yeah.

18:33.579 --> 18:37.016
You think you learned something down
in that college that I don't know about?

18:37.116 --> 18:39.856
- That's not what I meant, Tanner.
- No, you don't.

18:40.786 --> 18:43.389
And you better find
something else to plant.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.158
You been gone from around
here for far too long.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.826
I mean it, Conner.

18:47.926 --> 18:51.667
Otherwise, I'll be here every day,
kick your ass like I did back in school.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.575
Eileen, we've had a lot of
complaints about your friend.

19:03.675 --> 19:05.144
Oh, no.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.279
Hey there. I was
getting ready to go...

19:07.379 --> 19:10.249
- What's the matter?
- We're going to have to ask you to leave.

19:10.349 --> 19:14.153
Good, it's about damn time.
I get out of... Give me my check.

19:14.253 --> 19:15.661
We'll mail it to you.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.024
No, honey. Eileen,
you better tell her.

19:19.124 --> 19:21.960
Ain't nobody gonna mail me no check.
I didn't mail my work up in here.

19:22.060 --> 19:24.329
You ain't mailing me no check.
Where's my money?

19:24.429 --> 19:27.099
Madea, go home. I'll call you later.

19:27.199 --> 19:29.568
I don't give a damn who calling who.
Somebody gonna give me my money.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.770
Would you please leave quietly?

19:31.870 --> 19:33.972
Oh, sure. You want
me to leave quietly?

19:34.072 --> 19:35.808
You want me to leave quietly?

19:35.908 --> 19:38.077
I will show you how
to leave damn quietly.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.045
Y'all gonna give me my damn money.

19:40.145 --> 19:44.049
But before I get my damn purse,
I'm gonna get money out this register.

19:44.149 --> 19:45.851
- Excuse me.
- No, no.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.754
No, you can't do that. Put... Madea.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.756
Where my purse?
Unlock the damn thing!

19:50.856 --> 19:53.692
I got my purse here. This is $150.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.495
- This is what you owe me.
- Put that money back.

19:56.595 --> 19:58.564
I'm gonna take something else.
I'm gonna take this dress.

19:58.664 --> 20:00.632
- Stop it!
- Take whatever I want out of here.

20:00.732 --> 20:02.734
What's this pulling on me?

20:02.834 --> 20:04.470
You're embarrassing us.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.473
What the hell y'all looking at?
What the hell all y'all looking at?

20:07.573 --> 20:10.843
It's Christmas, and I'm takin'
what the hell I want up in here!

20:10.943 --> 20:14.379
What y'all gonna do about it?
What y'all gonna do about it?

20:14.479 --> 20:17.015
- I'll take this too.
- She didn't take her medication today.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.985
You got me coming up here,
trying to work in this place...

20:20.085 --> 20:21.787
and I don't know
what the hell gonna...

20:21.887 --> 20:23.956
Get out the way!
What the hell goin' on?

20:24.056 --> 20:27.359
- I know what the hell I'm doing!
- She has never acted like this before.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.495
I'm fabulous. I'm gone
with the wind fabulous.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.333
I am so sorry.

20:50.015 --> 20:53.619
Hi. I'm Lacey Williams,
Bailey's teacher.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.561
- Right. Come on in.
- Thank you.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.327
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.663
I just stopped by to talk to you.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.833
I graded another one of Bailey's
homework assignments...

21:07.933 --> 21:09.234
Listen, I'm sorry.

21:09.334 --> 21:12.571
He has to help his daddy at night,
so he doesn't get much time to study.

21:12.671 --> 21:15.841
Then he gets up early in the
morning to work with him...

21:15.941 --> 21:18.920
so I'll just have to get
on him to do better.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.819
He can't get any better.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.850
- He gets straight A's.
- What?

21:24.950 --> 21:28.520
Yeah. And to know he works after
school and in the morning...

21:28.620 --> 21:30.455
is even more impressive.

21:30.555 --> 21:34.262
He really should go to a gifted
school with a fine arts department.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.302
Wow.

21:39.331 --> 21:42.401
I always knew he was smart.
I didn't know he was that smart.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.971
Me and his daddy never
got much schoolin'.

21:46.071 --> 21:49.508
You really think Bailey could
make it outside of this place?

21:49.608 --> 21:51.381
I know he can.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.646
I mean, that's really
all I want for him.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.549
Bailey is always telling me
how good you are to him...

21:57.649 --> 22:01.220
and that you defend him in front
of those other kids, so thank you.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.756
- Well, he's a very special boy.
- Yeah, he is.

22:04.856 --> 22:06.658
- Have a seat.
- Sure. Thank you.

22:06.758 --> 22:09.270
- Can I get you something to drink?
- Yes.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.440
Thanks.

22:15.300 --> 22:16.879
Thank you.

22:18.270 --> 22:22.507
He also told me you want him to
sing at the Christmas Jubilee?

22:22.607 --> 22:24.943
Yes. He has a beautiful voice.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.679
You think the Jubilee is
gonna happen this year?

22:27.779 --> 22:29.248
Yes, haven't you heard?

22:29.348 --> 22:31.917
I got a friend of mine to
get us a sponsorship for it.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.919
So it's definitely gonna happen.

22:34.019 --> 22:36.793
- That's great news.
- Yeah, it really is.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.029
Oh, hell. What do you want?

22:44.129 --> 22:47.267
- Hi, I'm Lacey Williams.
- I know who you are.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.636
You're Bailey's teacher.
Bailey's gonna be late to school.

22:50.736 --> 22:53.908
He's got a lot of work to do here,
that's if he makes it at all.

22:54.573 --> 22:57.051
No need come around
here no more. Okay?

22:58.410 --> 23:00.217
I am so sorry.

23:02.848 --> 23:04.427
Merry Christmas.

23:09.521 --> 23:11.523
Oliver, this is so funny.

23:11.623 --> 23:14.960
I hadn't spoken to your mother
in a while, and we got talking...

23:15.060 --> 23:18.163
and she said you were drivin'
to Alabama to see Lacey!

23:18.263 --> 23:20.499
Miss Eileen, I'm happy
to have the company.

23:20.599 --> 23:23.935
Did I tell you I take blood pressure
medicine that makes me have to pee?

23:24.035 --> 23:27.172
- I'll have to go to the bathroom soon.
- Okay, go in the bush.

23:27.272 --> 23:30.444
I'm not putting my tush over no bush.
I don't know what's wrong with you.

23:32.844 --> 23:35.049
The leaves fell off
of it, but it work!

23:35.547 --> 23:37.449
- Jesus. Baby...
- It the wintertime.

23:37.549 --> 23:39.651
Just keep your eyes ahead.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.821
Okay? No, no, no. She's always
like this, since a child.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.389
- Yeah, since my childhood.
- Something's wrong.

23:44.489 --> 23:45.957
Something's wrong, but we accept it.

23:46.057 --> 23:48.026
You sure you didn't tell
her we were coming?

23:48.126 --> 23:50.162
I wanted this to be a big surprise!

23:50.262 --> 23:51.841
I'm sure.

23:52.264 --> 23:55.967
'Cause she's gonna be
so happy to see you!

23:56.067 --> 24:00.172
Madea, I told him how much
Lacey talks about him.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.508
Why you hollerin' like I'm in the back
of an airplane and you in first class?

24:03.608 --> 24:06.111
I can hear you. You right here.

24:06.211 --> 24:08.080
All I'm saying is this...

24:08.180 --> 24:10.082
- What's your name, boy? Olive Oil?
- Oliver.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.650
All I'm saying is this.

24:11.750 --> 24:14.853
If she wanted to talk to you,
she would have called you all the time.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.555
Don't get your hopes
up listening to Eileen.

24:16.655 --> 24:19.858
Don't listen to her. You two
are gonna be together again.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.260
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
I see it on your face.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.995
I see it on your face. Yeah!

24:24.095 --> 24:25.997
I would like to see us
have another chance.

24:26.097 --> 24:28.700
Y'all was in high school back then.
I got to pee, son.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.203
You been driving around
in circles for way too long.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.339
Go on over there. Pull over there,
ask these people directions.

24:34.439 --> 24:36.708
I'm gonna go in here
and use the bathroom.

24:36.808 --> 24:38.610
No, Madea.
This place don't look right.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.946
Eileen, here. This a...
Child, please.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.615
I grew up in the country.
Ain't nobody in here.

24:43.715 --> 24:45.795
He what sittin'
there willy-whilin'. Ask him.

24:46.485 --> 24:49.087
Lord, this thing is high.
You gotta get me a step.

24:49.187 --> 24:51.323
'Scuse me, sir.
You look like a nice man.

24:51.423 --> 24:53.592
How you doin'? We are lost.
He trying to find direction.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.727
I need a bathroom. Is there
a bathroom here somewhere?

24:55.827 --> 24:58.029
Yes, ma'am. Right over yonder.

24:58.129 --> 25:01.073
Get the directions here.
I got me to pee.

25:05.036 --> 25:06.638
Got to pee. Hell...

25:08.874 --> 25:10.112
What the...

25:19.851 --> 25:22.487
Go! Drive! Drive, Olive Oil, drive!

25:22.587 --> 25:24.956
Put the pedal to the metal.
Get the hell outta here!

25:25.056 --> 25:27.526
- They're tryin' to get me!
- What did you do?

25:27.626 --> 25:30.036
Drive! Hell, they're KKK!

25:38.570 --> 25:40.806
- This ain't the right address, is it?
- That's what she said.

25:40.906 --> 25:45.143
This can't be the right address.
These people might not be friendly.

25:45.243 --> 25:49.848
Look, this is 2013,
and it's almost Christmas.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.583
Sure it'll be fine.

25:51.683 --> 25:54.119
Boy, did you see what I
just went through in town?

25:54.219 --> 25:55.687
True.

25:55.787 --> 25:58.089
This just don't feel right.

25:58.189 --> 26:01.993
Up here in these woods,
ain't nobody around but us and trees.

26:02.093 --> 26:04.173
I don't like this.
Go knock on the door.

26:05.764 --> 26:08.467
- Thanks a lot.
- What you worried about, son?

26:08.567 --> 26:10.535
Somebody got to
live to tell the story.

26:10.635 --> 26:13.071
Tell 'em what happened to you.
Somebody got be an activist.

26:13.171 --> 26:15.173
Somebody got to call Sharpton.

26:15.273 --> 26:16.681
Never mind.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.362
Conner, where are you going?

26:22.462 --> 26:25.198
- Hey, what's going on?
- I mentioned Tanner and he lost it.

26:25.298 --> 26:27.768
- Conner!
- I've been waiting to see this.

26:27.868 --> 26:29.870
- I'm goin' with you, boy.
- Conner!

26:36.670 --> 26:38.004
Conner!

26:44.913 --> 26:48.050
- Uh-oh. Who is that?
- I told you this was the wrong address.

26:48.150 --> 26:49.923
We gotta go. Back up.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.955
There she is! Pull up.

26:54.055 --> 26:55.590
We're at the right place.

26:55.690 --> 26:57.599
- Come on. Hurry up.
- There she is.

26:59.528 --> 27:02.336
- Lacey!
- Look at you.

27:05.000 --> 27:07.444
Oh, my word. What are you doing here?

27:10.071 --> 27:13.742
I hitched a ride
with Oliver. Surprise!

27:13.842 --> 27:15.310
Surprise!

27:15.410 --> 27:17.679
- We came.
- Surprise.

27:17.779 --> 27:19.358
Who are you?

27:20.782 --> 27:22.751
I'm Conner.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.192
Girl, what the coroner doing here?
Who done died?

27:28.089 --> 27:32.433
You are the farmhand that
she hired. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

27:33.495 --> 27:35.097
I am Eileen, her mother.

27:35.197 --> 27:39.507
And this is Madea,
her great-aunt on my daddy's side.

27:41.269 --> 27:43.171
She sure don't look happy to see us.

27:43.271 --> 27:45.373
You better bite your tongue.

27:45.473 --> 27:48.486
She is happy to see
me anytime. Tell her.

27:51.479 --> 27:55.550
That don't look like happiness, honey.
That look like puredee constipation.

27:56.151 --> 27:57.619
Hi, Conner.

27:57.719 --> 27:59.087
How are ya? How ya doing?

27:59.187 --> 28:01.089
This handsome thing...

28:01.189 --> 28:03.859
this is Oliver, her boyfriend.

28:03.959 --> 28:05.694
Her boyfriend?

28:05.794 --> 28:07.931
Ex-boyfriend.

28:08.864 --> 28:11.566
It was nice of you to call him.

28:11.666 --> 28:14.269
That was a nice ruse to
get to see him. Fund-raiser.

28:14.369 --> 28:16.338
No, it wasn't a ruse.

28:16.438 --> 28:18.240
You know you miss him.

28:18.340 --> 28:21.209
Anyway, could you get my bags,
farmhand, please?

28:21.309 --> 28:23.446
- Yeah.
- I'll help.

28:24.479 --> 28:27.215
Lacey, come show us this farm.

28:27.315 --> 28:29.417
A little dusty, dusty.

28:29.517 --> 28:32.621
Come, my dear. I knew that.

28:32.721 --> 28:35.323
Baby, you know you got asthma.

28:35.423 --> 28:37.325
Mama, I don't have asthma anymore.

28:37.425 --> 28:39.628
Yeah, but you still
gotta be careful...

28:39.728 --> 28:42.364
because that could lead to cancer.

28:42.464 --> 28:44.933
Everything don't lead to cancer,
Eileen. Lord, help her.

28:45.033 --> 28:47.435
I'm gonna open the door.
Y'all need fresh air up in here.

28:47.535 --> 28:49.971
Got all these animals. This is
a nice room. I'll stay in here.

28:50.071 --> 28:51.439
- Good, good, good.
- Sure.

28:51.539 --> 28:53.975
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree?

28:54.075 --> 28:55.544
- No, I don't.
- Oh, my God.

28:55.644 --> 28:58.647
- That's why you wanted me to come here.
- Yeah, that's exactly why.

28:58.747 --> 29:00.382
- I'm gonna take this room.
- Okay.

29:00.482 --> 29:01.817
- Okay?
- That's nice too.

29:01.917 --> 29:03.518
- That's a nice room.
- Thank you.

29:03.618 --> 29:06.521
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- Yeah, put it in the room on the end.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.223
- I'm staying down there.
- All right.

29:08.323 --> 29:10.058
- All right.
- Is this your room here?

29:10.158 --> 29:12.427
- It's my room.
- It's lovely.

29:12.527 --> 29:14.196
Thank you. It's not clean.

29:14.296 --> 29:16.398
- Okay, now where's the kitchen?
- Let's go that way.

29:16.498 --> 29:18.133
- It's in there. Go ahead.
- I'm comin'.

29:18.233 --> 29:20.101
Don't be pushing on me.

29:20.201 --> 29:22.537
We saw this. This is the
dining room. It's yellow.

29:22.637 --> 29:25.273
It's yellow. It's bright yellow!

29:25.373 --> 29:26.942
It's nice, Mama, huh?

29:27.042 --> 29:29.477
Yeah, it's not my cup
of tea, but you know.

29:29.577 --> 29:31.880
- Back porch and everything.
- Aunt Madea, you like it?

29:31.980 --> 29:34.783
- Yeah, look at all the animals.
- It's very nice. Yes.

29:34.883 --> 29:36.852
Ask the man to bring
the groceries in.

29:36.952 --> 29:39.521
- They're in the trunk of the car.
- His name is Conner.

29:39.621 --> 29:43.391
I don't like you being up
here with him by yourself.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.894
What is Oliver supposed to think,
you living with a man?

29:45.994 --> 29:48.063
Why should I care what Oliver thinks?

29:48.163 --> 29:50.565
- You should. He still wants you.
- Mama, please.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.334
No, and you still want him.

29:52.434 --> 29:54.669
I know it. I got that feeling.

29:54.769 --> 29:57.239
I want some grandbabies.
What you waiting on?

29:57.339 --> 29:59.741
Eileen, stop meddling with that girl.

29:59.841 --> 30:03.252
Okay? You is in everybody's business.
Just leave this child alone.

30:03.812 --> 30:05.981
You have been talking
since we got in the car.

30:06.081 --> 30:09.317
You talk too much, Eileen. Please,
just shut up for a little while here.

30:09.417 --> 30:11.152
Leave this child alone.
She living her life.

30:11.252 --> 30:14.128
She happy out here in the
farm playing Old MacDonald.

30:24.933 --> 30:26.568
- Any more?
- Just the groceries.

30:26.668 --> 30:28.136
All right.

30:28.236 --> 30:30.316
- Hi.
- Wow.

30:31.239 --> 30:33.819
- It's great to see you, Lacey.
- Yeah, you too.

30:34.542 --> 30:37.045
Let me put these down,
and I'll be ready to go to school.

30:37.145 --> 30:38.553
- Yeah.
- All right?

30:43.385 --> 30:46.021
So, you didn't tell me
your boyfriend was coming.

30:46.121 --> 30:48.390
High school. Non-factor, trust me.

30:48.490 --> 30:50.592
My mother... I can't believe
she just showed up.

30:50.692 --> 30:52.727
And your parents are on their way.

30:52.827 --> 30:56.298
Yep. Gonna be here right after
you get back from school.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.600
I know. What are we gonna do?

30:58.700 --> 31:00.438
You better think of something.

31:01.603 --> 31:04.343
- Baby...
- Boyfriend.

31:06.107 --> 31:08.543
- Are you ready to go?
- Yes, sure.

31:08.643 --> 31:12.414
Hold on. Hold on. I heard
somebody say, "Go." Oh, Lord.

31:12.514 --> 31:14.683
Take me anywhere. I got to
get away from your mama.

31:14.783 --> 31:17.085
I'll go to hell and back
to get away from her.

31:17.185 --> 31:19.087
She talk too damn much.
Can I go with y'all?

31:19.187 --> 31:23.091
Okay. Maybe you can keep an eye on
my class while I go into the meeting.

31:23.191 --> 31:25.560
I'm sorry. Watch your class?

31:25.660 --> 31:27.862
She wants me to watch
her class. Children?

31:27.962 --> 31:29.597
Child, me and children
don't get along.

31:29.697 --> 31:31.199
Now, let me see.

31:31.299 --> 31:32.600
Ankle-biting...

31:32.700 --> 31:34.336
disease-carrying...

31:34.436 --> 31:38.416
little children of God,
or your mama...

31:39.808 --> 31:42.510
satanic, loud-mouthed,
diarrhea woman from hell.

31:42.610 --> 31:44.849
I think I'll go with the children.
Praise God.

31:45.914 --> 31:48.450
- All right.
- I'll drop you back off on my way home.

31:48.550 --> 31:50.518
Okay, close your trunk, son.
Close your trunk.

31:50.618 --> 31:52.287
I'm gonna ride with him.

31:52.387 --> 31:55.657
No offense to y'all car,
'cause this a nice car.

31:55.757 --> 31:57.959
But this bring back memories, child.

31:58.059 --> 32:00.996
I got pregnant. Meat Loaf was
playing "Dashboard Light."

32:01.096 --> 32:04.165
I was sitting up there, and I kept
hitting my head on that steering wheel.

32:04.265 --> 32:06.601
It was just awful.
It was an awful time.

32:06.701 --> 32:09.070
Look. The door even sound the same.

32:09.170 --> 32:12.574
Child, this is just what it's...
Yep, that bring back memories.

32:12.674 --> 32:14.376
Watch this.

32:14.476 --> 32:16.611
That's what I used to do. Drop it.

32:16.711 --> 32:20.348
That car built for comfort and
built for speed, just like me.

32:20.448 --> 32:22.784
This a nice truck, but how
I'm s'posed to get in here?

32:22.884 --> 32:25.253
- Pull the seat back.
- I'll sit in the back. Hold on.

32:25.353 --> 32:27.789
No, you don't have to...
Yeah, just pull that back.

32:27.889 --> 32:30.792
You got to get some of them
things to help me get in here.

32:30.892 --> 32:33.561
Is there something to...
Hold on. I got it.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.530
Yeah, that's it. Come on in.

32:35.630 --> 32:37.732
Boy, you got to get a low car here.

32:39.801 --> 32:42.303
- You 'bout to make me mad.
- Give me your hand.

32:42.403 --> 32:45.882
- Now, hold on.
- All right, I got you.

32:46.908 --> 32:50.145
- Good morning, class.
- Good morning.

32:50.245 --> 32:53.915
This is my Aunt Mabel.
But everybody calls her Madea.

32:54.015 --> 32:56.818
I have to go to a meeting down
the hall with Ms. Porter...

32:56.918 --> 33:00.055
and I asked Miss Madea
to keep an eye on you.

33:00.155 --> 33:03.358
Now, you know what to do and
you know how to behave, right?

33:03.458 --> 33:04.993
Yes, ma'am.

33:05.093 --> 33:07.462
- I'll be right back. Thanks, Madea.
- Yeah, I love it.

33:07.562 --> 33:10.098
I love well-behaved children.
That's wonderful.

33:10.198 --> 33:11.936
Y'all look so nice.

33:17.805 --> 33:21.209
Hello. Hello. Now, y'all got to
go back to the Stepford children.

33:21.309 --> 33:24.879
Don't act like you... Don't act
like this. Now, calm the hell down.

33:24.979 --> 33:28.616
I'm in here. Do yourself a favor.
Do the right thing.

33:28.716 --> 33:31.219
- You belong in this class?
- Yes, ma'am.

33:31.319 --> 33:33.855
- Okay. What's your name?
- Bailey.

33:33.955 --> 33:35.523
Bailey? Okay. Well, go on.

33:35.623 --> 33:38.693
Your teacher went down the hall,
and I'm sitting in for her. Have a seat.

33:38.793 --> 33:40.595
You better hope she comes back.

33:40.695 --> 33:43.799
She's the only teacher
that likes you here.

33:47.035 --> 33:50.071
Don't sit by me. You are so dirty.

33:50.171 --> 33:52.440
Leave that boy alone. Where else
he gonna sit? Sit down, son.

33:52.540 --> 33:54.075
Sit down. Don't worry about her.

33:54.175 --> 33:57.579
Don't you ever pick on somebody just
'cause you can. Do you understand?

33:57.679 --> 33:59.647
They used to do that to me
when I was in kindergarten.

33:59.747 --> 34:02.584
'Cause I was six feet tall,
they all want to talk about me.

34:02.684 --> 34:05.086
I had a full figure and
curves and all that stuff.

34:05.186 --> 34:07.555
They wanted to make fun of me.
But I wasn't having it.

34:07.655 --> 34:11.292
You understand? I fought back.
That's why I got tough-skinned.

34:11.391 --> 34:14.161
You may have to fight back sometimes.
Do you understand?

34:14.262 --> 34:18.299
Don't worry about these people in
here trying to make you feel bad.

34:18.399 --> 34:21.268
You got to be nice to people.
Pass it on, niceness.

34:21.369 --> 34:23.271
- Do you understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

34:23.371 --> 34:27.007
All right, I'm going to write
my name on the board...

34:27.108 --> 34:29.745
so you all will know what my name is.

34:30.844 --> 34:33.050
Ain't no chalk.
Y'all ain't got no chalk?

34:33.982 --> 34:35.949
Ain't got no eraser either.
"No cause..."

34:36.050 --> 34:38.853
Okay. I don't know
what all that mean.

34:38.953 --> 34:42.262
All right. Well,
what we gonna do is...

34:43.257 --> 34:44.759
I'm gonna tell y'all a story.

34:44.859 --> 34:48.496
This is the story of Christmas.
Christmas.

34:48.596 --> 34:53.001
This is what I learned when I
went to school... Sunday school.

34:53.101 --> 34:57.411
This is the story of the nativities.

34:59.440 --> 35:02.177
Little baby Jesus was born.

35:02.277 --> 35:04.857
He was born to the Virgin Mary...

35:05.780 --> 35:09.717
J. Blige, and as Mary was on tour...

35:09.817 --> 35:11.619
she met this man named Joe...

35:11.719 --> 35:13.688
Manganiello, who played a werewolf.

35:13.788 --> 35:16.391
And he was in love with her.
She said, "Joe.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.826
I am thou-ist with the child-ist.

35:18.926 --> 35:21.696
And the holiness is come upon me...

35:21.796 --> 35:24.206
and I'm going to have a baby-ist."

35:25.600 --> 35:29.003
And Joe said, "Really?"

35:29.103 --> 35:31.172
They ain't know what to do.

35:31.272 --> 35:33.241
So he went on and stayed with her...

35:33.341 --> 35:36.711
and they went on 'cause they
was expecting the holy child.

35:36.811 --> 35:38.279
That's right.

35:38.379 --> 35:42.784
And the Bible say in
second "Deuteronomo"...

35:42.884 --> 35:47.889
that when he came to the earth...

35:47.989 --> 35:51.726
he came through the Virgin...
piña colada.

35:51.826 --> 35:53.795
And as she was there...

35:53.895 --> 35:56.831
they were trying to find
somewhere to have the baby...

35:56.931 --> 36:00.668
but they kept going to all these hotels,
and wouldn't none of 'em let them in.

36:00.768 --> 36:02.704
Marriott. Shut the door.

36:02.804 --> 36:04.939
Hilton. Shut the door.

36:05.039 --> 36:07.675
Tried to get to the Ritz-Carlton,
they said, "You don't belong here."

36:07.775 --> 36:10.745
Everybody just got put out.
They went to the Motel 6.

36:10.845 --> 36:14.449
They didn't even leave the light
on for her. She was in the dark.

36:15.516 --> 36:18.019
Anyway, there was Mary...

36:18.119 --> 36:20.788
'bout to have that baby,
so she sat down at a bus stop.

36:20.888 --> 36:22.890
MARTA bus passed by,
wouldn't even pick her up...

36:22.990 --> 36:25.760
to take her to the holy
city of Birmingham.

36:25.860 --> 36:29.831
And as she sat there,
she went into laborer.

36:29.931 --> 36:32.000
And as she started laboring...

36:32.100 --> 36:34.068
a mangy dog walked up beside her.

36:34.168 --> 36:37.639
See, God will send you a dog when
you need it, even if you don't.

36:37.739 --> 36:39.707
And that dog said,
"What's wrong with you?"

36:39.807 --> 36:43.611
And as she sat there,
she had that baby...

36:43.711 --> 36:46.681
and that baby came
next to that mangy dog.

36:46.781 --> 36:49.984
That's why they say he
was born in a mangy.

36:50.084 --> 36:52.220
Hallelujah. Let the Lord use ya.

36:52.320 --> 36:55.356
Okay, that's the story of the baby Jesus.
That's the hip-hop version.

36:55.456 --> 36:58.901
I'm glad I went to church
and to Sunday school. Okay.

37:00.061 --> 37:02.072
Where my purse?

37:03.865 --> 37:05.876
Where my purse?

37:07.368 --> 37:09.270
Y'all ain't seen what
happened to my purse?

37:09.370 --> 37:11.005
I'm gonna tell y'all another story.

37:11.105 --> 37:13.241
This is the story of Easter Sunday.

37:13.341 --> 37:16.144
Jesus was hanging
between two thieves.

37:16.244 --> 37:18.746
One was Baranibus and the
other was the Dinosaurus.

37:18.846 --> 37:20.983
Somebody better find
my purse right now.

37:23.017 --> 37:26.087
- All we have to do is sign that thing?
- Yes.

37:26.187 --> 37:28.456
Lacey told me you needed
the money right away.

37:28.556 --> 37:31.192
So I spoke with my boss and
got the money in advance.

37:31.292 --> 37:33.372
We're both very sure we'll
get the sponsorship.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.863
What's in it for you?

37:35.963 --> 37:39.400
Well, my company gets paid a
10% commission by the company.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.469
You get the entire 100 grand.

37:41.569 --> 37:44.305
It will help us with the shortfall.

37:44.405 --> 37:46.841
- Is everything okay, Wilbur?
- Yes, Your Honor.

37:46.941 --> 37:50.022
It's good. It is good.

37:50.545 --> 37:52.625
All right then. Let's do this.

37:59.053 --> 38:01.622
Wonderful. Here you go.

38:01.722 --> 38:04.826
Now, we'll bring the sponsors down
to the Jubilee for a photo op.

38:04.926 --> 38:07.563
- That's all we ask.
- Of course.

38:08.496 --> 38:09.964
- Thank you, son.
- You got it.

38:10.064 --> 38:11.632
Thank you so much.

38:11.732 --> 38:13.968
You have no idea how
much we needed this.

38:14.068 --> 38:16.170
- It's my pleasure.
- Lacey.

38:16.270 --> 38:19.351
- Thank you.
- This is my town too.

38:20.274 --> 38:21.853
Glad I can help.

38:23.077 --> 38:24.412
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:24.512 --> 38:26.091
After you.

38:27.582 --> 38:29.050
There you go.

38:29.150 --> 38:32.060
You have no clue how much
you've just helped us. I mean...

38:32.653 --> 38:35.734
It was my pleasure.
I'm glad I could help.

38:37.325 --> 38:39.660
- Thank you again.
- You got it.

38:39.760 --> 38:41.963
- Here.
- What's this?

38:42.063 --> 38:44.732
- It's your Christmas present.
- No. I can't take that.

38:44.832 --> 38:47.268
- Sure you can.
- I really can't.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.778
You've already done
enough for us. Thank you.

38:53.941 --> 38:55.243
What are you doing?

38:55.343 --> 38:57.548
Your mother told me she
thought you missed me.

38:59.213 --> 39:02.884
Look, I know we were children,
but I think about you still.

39:02.984 --> 39:04.886
Listen, Oliver,
that was a long time ago...

39:04.986 --> 39:07.355
- and I actually have to tell you...
- Lacey!

39:07.455 --> 39:09.690
- Get in here. Quick!
- Excuse me.

39:09.790 --> 39:11.369
Hurry!

39:11.959 --> 39:13.594
There's a weird woman in here.

39:13.694 --> 39:15.730
What they did back in the day...

39:15.830 --> 39:17.198
Lacey, who is this?

39:17.298 --> 39:19.634
- My aunt Madea.
- Hi.

39:19.734 --> 39:21.068
What are you doing?

39:21.168 --> 39:24.272
I was just teaching these
children a lesson on Jesus...

39:24.372 --> 39:26.808
from the time he was born
until the time he died on Earth.

39:26.908 --> 39:29.444
She tried to steal my purse, but I
taught her a lesson. Here you go.

39:29.544 --> 39:32.980
Now you have been crowned
the Christmas... Praise. Hallelujah.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.416
- I got her, didn't I? I got her, Bailey.
- Yes, ma'am.

39:35.516 --> 39:38.553
'Scuse me. Oliver, take me to the house.
I'm getting the hell outta here.

39:38.653 --> 39:40.455
We'll talk when I get
back for the Jubilee.

39:40.555 --> 39:43.727
Lucy. How do you even...
How did she...

39:47.061 --> 39:49.141
That's a nice-lookin' tree.

40:08.549 --> 40:10.017
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

40:10.117 --> 40:12.119
- Are they here yet?
- Nope.

40:12.219 --> 40:14.789
I rushed home. How's my mother?

40:14.889 --> 40:17.291
I don't know. She only
said two words to me.

40:17.391 --> 40:19.227
You think of how you're
gonna handle this yet?

40:19.327 --> 40:21.162
No. Were you able to
talk to your parents?

40:21.262 --> 40:22.841
Nope, no cell phone.

40:24.932 --> 40:27.672
Guess I'll have to talk to
'em now 'cause they're here.

40:29.770 --> 40:31.739
- Hey, hey!
- Hi, y'all!

40:31.839 --> 40:33.708
Hey, hey! Look at you!

40:33.808 --> 40:35.615
Don't you go nowhere.

40:36.877 --> 40:38.513
I'm gonna get your mama.

40:38.613 --> 40:41.349
- I look all right?
- Yeah, you look great.

40:41.449 --> 40:43.484
- Son! Son!
- Mama! Daddy!

40:43.584 --> 40:45.288
Look at you!

40:45.886 --> 40:47.624
Daddy, not the bear hug!

40:48.923 --> 40:50.892
Your old man still got it, don't he?

40:50.992 --> 40:53.361
Look at my Grizzly Adams.

40:53.461 --> 40:56.838
Look at you. You look
like a mountain man.

40:57.632 --> 41:00.701
Hey, Son, see this? This ain't fat.
This is all foreskin.

41:00.801 --> 41:02.870
Buddy, stop. Don't start so early.

41:02.970 --> 41:04.705
- You must be Lacey.
- Yes.

41:04.805 --> 41:06.374
Look at you!

41:06.474 --> 41:08.109
- Oh, my!
- You put her down.

41:08.209 --> 41:10.845
You don't gotta break
her and snap her neck.

41:10.945 --> 41:13.114
Just give him a little nudge
to the flapjacks there.

41:13.214 --> 41:16.183
He'll put you down.
Where are my manners?

41:16.283 --> 41:19.353
I am Conner's mama.
Please call me Mrs. Williams.

41:19.453 --> 41:21.856
- Hi.
- I kiddin'! You...

41:21.956 --> 41:25.003
Call me Kim or Mama.
Just don't call me late for dinner.

41:25.526 --> 41:26.994
I'm joshing you.

41:27.094 --> 41:29.397
- Look how pretty. She's very pretty.
- Thank you.

41:29.497 --> 41:32.066
She is even more beautiful than
I ever could have imagined.

41:32.166 --> 41:34.201
Thank you.

41:34.301 --> 41:37.004
So nice to finally meet you.

41:37.104 --> 41:38.573
You too.

41:38.673 --> 41:40.141
Look at this place.

41:40.241 --> 41:42.577
It is beautiful.
This place is stupendous.

41:42.677 --> 41:45.947
My mama and daddy...
Sorry. I'm sorry.

41:46.047 --> 41:48.449
They just would've been
so proud. Thank you.

41:48.549 --> 41:50.185
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mama.

41:50.951 --> 41:53.220
I was so upset when I
heard you two eloped.

41:53.320 --> 41:55.723
I thought maybe you'd
come down to Louisiana...

41:55.823 --> 41:58.559
and went up the bayou for the
Swamp Manor to get hitched.

41:58.659 --> 42:01.929
We would have thrown you
such a shindig. You know that.

42:02.029 --> 42:03.998
Hey, I'm glad y'all did elope.

42:04.098 --> 42:06.400
You done saved me
an assload of money.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.969
So I appreciate it.

42:08.069 --> 42:10.204
Well, you've spent enough
money on me already, Daddy.

42:10.304 --> 42:12.607
- I'm glad you recognize that.
- Honey, we love you.

42:12.707 --> 42:14.742
Anything you want, my son. Anything.

42:14.842 --> 42:16.077
Well...

42:16.177 --> 42:17.813
Have you two eaten?

42:19.547 --> 42:21.627
No, but...

42:22.583 --> 42:24.485
Good, 'cause I caught
Christmas dinner.

42:24.585 --> 42:25.987
Caught?

42:26.087 --> 42:30.260
We are gonna have hot possum potpie.
I'm gonna make it.

42:30.925 --> 42:32.927
It's good. Nice flaky crust.

42:33.027 --> 42:34.495
Gonna have possum stew...

42:34.595 --> 42:37.131
and your uncle DeWayne done
got me some white lightning.

42:37.231 --> 42:39.367
Here, let me take this, Daddy.

42:39.467 --> 42:41.969
Actually, Lacey's a vegetarian.

42:42.069 --> 42:45.039
She's a vegetarianist? On a farm.

42:45.139 --> 42:47.108
- Honey, that must be hard.
- That don't mean nothing.

42:47.208 --> 42:50.645
We's Baptist, and we still like a
nice possum stew every now and then.

42:50.745 --> 42:53.848
No, Buddy. It means
she doesn't eat meat.

42:53.948 --> 42:57.118
- She doesn't eat meat.
- Oh, you're a tofu farter.

42:57.218 --> 42:59.186
- Daddy.
- Ain't nothing wrong with that.

42:59.286 --> 43:01.455
I like tofu farters. God bless you.

43:01.555 --> 43:03.524
All I'm saying, Son,
if she don't eat meat...

43:03.624 --> 43:07.171
that might be a bad thing when it
comes to certain parts of the anatomy.

43:07.762 --> 43:11.098
Mama, can you please... I'm sorry.

43:11.198 --> 43:13.000
We just met her. Now, stop.

43:13.100 --> 43:15.536
- Start slow, all right?
- I was just kidding.

43:15.636 --> 43:17.104
I'm sorry. He's crazy.

43:17.204 --> 43:19.273
What are we doing standing
out here getting all dusty?

43:19.373 --> 43:22.510
Let's go inside and get
our meal on. I'm starvin'.

43:22.610 --> 43:25.479
I brought you some spices
from your Aunt Tutu's garden.

43:25.579 --> 43:27.048
- Okay. Mama...
- You're gonna love 'em.

43:27.148 --> 43:29.784
- Let me go get that.
- Hang on, y'all.

43:29.884 --> 43:32.362
Lacey's mama is cookin'.

43:32.787 --> 43:34.755
Lacey's ma... She's here?

43:34.855 --> 43:36.290
- Your mama's here now?
- Yes.

43:36.390 --> 43:38.793
- Her mama is here, Buddy.
- Hey, hey! All right.

43:38.893 --> 43:40.628
Looks like we get
to meet the in-laws.

43:40.728 --> 43:42.997
Actually, we kind of have a problem.

43:43.097 --> 43:44.365
What's the problem?

43:44.465 --> 43:46.670
Lacey hadn't told her
mama that we're married.

43:47.268 --> 43:49.370
- What?
- Why ain't you told her?

43:49.470 --> 43:50.638
Well...

43:50.738 --> 43:53.307
my mother had dreams
for my entire life...

43:53.407 --> 43:56.488
and Conner was not in that dream.

43:58.879 --> 44:00.347
I'm sorry. I do...

44:00.447 --> 44:03.417
- I don't understand.
- I think I do. Let me ask you something.

44:03.517 --> 44:06.791
When she had them dreams,
was they in color or black-and-white?

44:11.192 --> 44:13.329
She doesn't want you
with a white man.

44:15.996 --> 44:18.332
I'm sorry. That's awful.

44:18.432 --> 44:20.401
Honey, we taught
all of our children...

44:20.501 --> 44:22.670
"Never see color. Only see heart."

44:22.770 --> 44:26.073
- Isn't that right, Conner?
- That's right.

44:26.173 --> 44:29.777
It's such a shame she does not
know what kind of person you are.

44:30.611 --> 44:32.379
I'll tell you who he is.

44:32.479 --> 44:34.949
Always taught him to
look at a woman's heart.

44:35.049 --> 44:37.118
'Cause that's where their rack hangs.

44:37.218 --> 44:38.385
Daddy.

44:38.485 --> 44:40.621
I'm just kiddin'.
She got a nice rack.

44:40.721 --> 44:42.456
Your mama used to have a nice rack.

44:42.556 --> 44:45.659
Now she bends over, just looks
like she's got a 7-10 split.

44:45.759 --> 44:48.195
- What the hell does that mean?
- It's a bowling term.

44:48.295 --> 44:50.498
- I don't like that, Daddy.
- I don't either.

44:50.598 --> 44:53.934
I'm just kiddin'. I still like to go to
the bowling alley every now and then.

44:54.034 --> 44:56.170
- You're sexy to me.
- Will you hush?

44:56.270 --> 44:58.973
I'm gonna start talking about
all your wrinkly, saggy parts.

44:59.073 --> 45:02.211
- It's like a turkey giblet in there.
- That was over the line.

45:03.711 --> 45:06.883
Well, honey, Conner,
who does she think you are?

45:07.481 --> 45:09.219
She thinks I'm the farm help.

45:10.150 --> 45:12.787
- Well, there's a switcheroo.
- The farm help.

45:12.887 --> 45:15.456
Do you think we should leave?
I think we should maybe leave.

45:15.556 --> 45:18.359
I ain't goin' nowhere.
Hell, I just drove up here.

45:18.459 --> 45:21.395
- I am tired. I want a beer.
- I don't want you guys to leave.

45:21.495 --> 45:23.939
Well, what should we do?

45:25.165 --> 45:27.201
Can you give me
some time to tell her?

45:27.301 --> 45:31.105
I mean, I have to break it to
her gently. She's been very sick.

45:31.205 --> 45:33.407
- Oh, no.
- I'm so sorry.

45:33.507 --> 45:35.910
- What's wrong?
- She has a weak heart.

45:36.010 --> 45:38.145
Then by all means, you just...

45:38.245 --> 45:40.481
take your time and tell
her when you're ready.

45:40.581 --> 45:42.416
- Thank you.
- Okay.

45:42.516 --> 45:45.219
We don't want her ticker
to tock out on you here.

45:45.319 --> 45:47.087
- We'll behave ourselves.
- Yeah.

45:47.187 --> 45:48.923
- You know what we'll be?
- What?

45:49.023 --> 45:51.525
- Parents of the help.
- That's right. Parents of the help.

45:51.625 --> 45:54.562
- "Can I get you something?"
- Let's head in.

45:54.662 --> 45:56.964
- Come on.
- Daddy, behave.

45:57.064 --> 45:59.867
I'll behave. Like a bull in a rodeo.

45:59.967 --> 46:02.670
- Did you paint this? This is fabulous.
- I started.

46:02.770 --> 46:04.672
- Still needs some work.
- Where you at?

46:04.772 --> 46:06.774
I bet this house run them
in the double figures.

46:06.874 --> 46:08.242
- Hey, Madea.
- Hey!

46:08.342 --> 46:10.344
- This is my mama, Kim.
- How you doin'?

46:10.444 --> 46:12.346
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Medium.

46:12.446 --> 46:14.281
And this is my daddy, Buddy.

46:14.381 --> 46:16.083
- Nice to meet you.
- How you doin', Buddy?

46:16.183 --> 46:18.552
- I'm doing well.
- I see y'all brought a bag.

46:18.652 --> 46:20.231
No, that's just my wife.

46:20.988 --> 46:24.358
Forgive my husband. He is
just a horse's ass and a half.

46:24.458 --> 46:27.361
- Wait. I smell cookin'.
- Yeah, that's Eileen.

46:27.461 --> 46:29.496
- Her mama was up in there cooking.
- Where is she?

46:29.596 --> 46:31.799
She was in the kitchen,
but she went to the backyard.

46:31.899 --> 46:33.734
Come on. Sit down. Take a load off.

46:33.834 --> 46:36.470
Take a load off. Y'all sit a spell.

46:36.570 --> 46:39.640
- Y'all want something to drink?
- I believe I'll have something.

46:39.740 --> 46:41.642
I like you. You're a nice lady.

46:41.742 --> 46:43.711
Don't be flirting with me
in front of your wife.

46:43.811 --> 46:46.585
If I put this thing on,
you won't be able to get rid of it.

46:47.514 --> 46:49.884
I'll have him pay my rent,
car note and everything else.

46:49.984 --> 46:51.654
I'm from the old school.

46:52.586 --> 46:54.388
Believe me, he can't help it.

46:54.488 --> 46:56.991
And if you can stand him,
you're welcome to him, right?

46:57.091 --> 46:59.360
- Hey, Conner, get me a beer.
- Yes, sir.

46:59.460 --> 47:00.928
Well, Miss Madea...

47:01.028 --> 47:03.998
looks like we're gonna be spending
Christmas dinner together this year...

47:04.098 --> 47:05.566
but don't you worry.

47:05.666 --> 47:07.837
We could care less you're black.

47:10.037 --> 47:12.072
"African-American," Buddy.

47:12.172 --> 47:15.075
Right, whatever. African-American.

47:15.175 --> 47:17.478
That's all right. I don't care
that y'all are white America...

47:17.578 --> 47:19.914
Angro... Angrola-Saxons...
Saxophonists.

47:20.014 --> 47:23.254
I don't care. That don't matter at
all that y'all Anglo-Saxophonists.

47:24.018 --> 47:25.519
I like her.

47:25.619 --> 47:28.055
She's got a good sense of humor
and those big, sturdy feet.

47:28.155 --> 47:31.392
You need a good sense of
humor with this group in here.

47:31.492 --> 47:33.961
- Here, Daddy, beer. Drink up.
- Appreciate it.

47:34.061 --> 47:37.231
- Please, drink up.
- I'll tell you what, Son.

47:37.331 --> 47:39.667
That last girl you with
was so dadgum ugly...

47:39.767 --> 47:41.869
my dog humped her leg
and shut his eyeballs.

47:41.969 --> 47:44.709
Oh, stop it. He's awful!

47:45.706 --> 47:49.576
"He shut his eyeballs." That's ugly.

47:49.676 --> 47:53.280
Please forgive my husband.
He is a wannabe comedian.

47:53.380 --> 47:54.848
You are no Jeff Foxworthy.

47:54.948 --> 47:57.484
Well, I try to be,
but who can? Who can?

47:57.584 --> 48:00.754
Did you hear the one about the
two rabbis and the black dude?

48:00.854 --> 48:02.589
- Daddy.
- No.

48:02.689 --> 48:05.159
Did you hear the one about the
stray bullet that killed the redneck...

48:05.259 --> 48:07.461
for telling the story about the
rabbis and the black dude?

48:07.561 --> 48:09.140
It's hilarious!

48:10.531 --> 48:12.800
I got him, didn't I? I got him.

48:12.900 --> 48:15.844
- Y'all get your ass shot.
- I like her. I do.

48:16.837 --> 48:19.042
I do too. She likes to hang.

48:20.641 --> 48:22.609
No, ain't gonna be no
hanging around here now.

48:22.709 --> 48:24.745
No, he didn't mean that.
He meant that...

48:24.845 --> 48:27.548
You calm the hell down?
You are so politically correct.

48:27.648 --> 48:29.450
They're having fun.
I'm having fun too.

48:29.550 --> 48:31.926
I wasn't offended.
Hell, I got a pistol.

48:32.853 --> 48:35.189
I knew she knew that.
Let me ask you this.

48:35.289 --> 48:36.757
Do you know Oprah?

48:36.857 --> 48:38.659
Honey, I told you...

48:38.759 --> 48:41.161
all black folk don't
necessarily know each other.

48:41.261 --> 48:46.300
- Could've fooled me.
- Do I look like Paul Bunyan or what?

48:46.400 --> 48:50.414
Actually, you sure in the hell do.
And the Jolly Green Giant too. Ho-ho-ho.

48:51.071 --> 48:53.741
- Farmhand, please help me.
- His name is Conner.

48:53.841 --> 48:54.875
Whew!

48:54.975 --> 48:57.011
I think the tree...

48:57.111 --> 48:59.079
would look good right here.

48:59.179 --> 49:01.348
If you don't mind me butting in...

49:01.448 --> 49:04.785
I think it would look really
pretty right here by the window...

49:04.885 --> 49:07.554
and that way all the
passersby can enjoy it.

49:07.654 --> 49:10.224
That's where we had it every year.

49:10.324 --> 49:12.793
- And who are you?
- That's a pretty tree.

49:12.893 --> 49:15.062
I am... I'm Conner's mom.

49:15.162 --> 49:18.641
That's Kim and that's Buddy.
These are Coroner's parents.

49:19.700 --> 49:22.903
This is Eileen. I wanna scream.
I mean, Eileen.

49:23.003 --> 49:27.975
Trees are for the family,
not for strangers.

49:28.075 --> 49:30.077
What the hell these
people doing here?

49:30.177 --> 49:33.258
Mama, they came to visit
Conner for Christmas.

49:34.381 --> 49:39.353
Really? That is just
like my daughter.

49:39.453 --> 49:41.055
I raised you right.

49:41.155 --> 49:45.592
My daughter has always been
good with helping the help.

49:45.692 --> 49:47.728
Yes.

49:47.828 --> 49:50.531
- Where you staying?
- We're thinking of staying here.

49:50.631 --> 49:53.267
Yeah. We drove all the
way up from Louisiana...

49:53.367 --> 49:56.004
to spend Christmas
with Conner and Lacey.

49:57.004 --> 49:59.914
It'll be a little cramped...

50:00.674 --> 50:02.412
but we'll make do.

50:04.311 --> 50:07.081
Madea and I will share a room.

50:07.181 --> 50:09.383
You, Buddy and...

50:09.483 --> 50:10.551
Kim.

50:10.651 --> 50:12.920
Kim, take another room...

50:13.020 --> 50:14.855
- and Carver...
- Conner.

50:14.955 --> 50:16.256
- That's what I said.
- Conner.

50:16.356 --> 50:18.868
Yes, Carver, you can take the sofa.

50:19.960 --> 50:22.329
Let me get some decorations.

50:22.429 --> 50:24.932
Okay. I just...

50:25.032 --> 50:28.402
So many memories just coming
back to me bein' here.

50:28.502 --> 50:32.473
To tell you, Lacey, my mama,
she loved this place. She did.

50:32.573 --> 50:35.542
I'm so happy you all came
back here to take care of it.

50:35.642 --> 50:37.050
Welcome.

50:37.978 --> 50:40.114
Well, my daughter's
paying the mortgage...

50:40.214 --> 50:42.449
so I hope you bring
in a crop this year.

50:42.549 --> 50:44.952
I told you not to buy this farm.

50:45.052 --> 50:48.989
That dam up north caused a lot of
problems this year for the farmers.

50:49.089 --> 50:52.693
But Conner, he's got him a new
strain of corn that takes less water.

50:52.793 --> 50:54.428
Now, how's that work, Conner?

50:54.528 --> 50:57.998
I studied agriculture
at New York State.

50:58.098 --> 50:59.633
Is that where you two met?

50:59.733 --> 51:01.368
Yeah. He's brilliant.

51:01.468 --> 51:04.271
Gets it from his old man.
Runs in the genes.

51:04.371 --> 51:07.641
At the science of it,
not so much the farming.

51:07.741 --> 51:11.011
So genius, little Einstein,
little Stephen Hawkins.

51:11.111 --> 51:14.114
We used to call him
"Smarty Britches" when he was little.

51:14.214 --> 51:17.951
If you put some Viagra in that
tree's water, it'll stay up all year.

51:18.051 --> 51:21.860
You better put some Viagra in your water.
See what happen with your tree.

51:25.192 --> 51:28.529
- All right, let's decorate.
- No, thank you. I can manage.

51:28.629 --> 51:31.431
I brought some decorations
from Atlanta...

51:31.531 --> 51:33.867
and I work at one of the
finest department stores...

51:33.967 --> 51:36.203
so I know a thing or two about taste.

51:36.303 --> 51:37.882
Where...

51:38.305 --> 51:40.274
Where did you get this tree?

51:40.374 --> 51:42.509
I mean, you have a beautiful
Christmas tree...

51:42.609 --> 51:46.122
right outside the kitchen
window and none in the house.

51:48.315 --> 51:49.894
What's wrong?

51:50.484 --> 51:52.553
Please don't tell me that's
your granddaddy's tree.

51:52.653 --> 51:54.154
Oh, dear God.

51:54.254 --> 51:57.324
Mama, was there a yellow ribbon
wrapped around that tree?

51:57.424 --> 51:59.265
Yes, and I cut it off.

52:00.761 --> 52:03.130
Excuse me. Excuse me.

52:03.230 --> 52:04.934
What happened? What?

52:05.932 --> 52:07.968
My mama planted that tree...

52:08.068 --> 52:10.546
in memory of my granddaddy.

52:14.641 --> 52:16.843
Well, how was I
supposed to know that?

52:16.943 --> 52:18.679
This doesn't make any sense. Lacey.

52:18.779 --> 52:22.716
Did these people come
when you bought this land?

52:22.816 --> 52:26.693
This is your land now.
You can do what you want to with it.

52:27.354 --> 52:29.089
Excuse me.

52:29.189 --> 52:30.657
You don't look so good.

52:30.757 --> 52:32.993
Feeling a little light-headed.

52:33.093 --> 52:34.995
Well, sit down then. Sit down.

52:35.095 --> 52:36.503
Okay.

52:38.332 --> 52:41.068
It's all these strange people
in this house, that's what it is.

52:41.168 --> 52:43.270
It ain't them people,
it's you! Hell, you!

52:43.370 --> 52:46.440
You lost your damn mind.
You done lost your damn mind!

52:46.540 --> 52:50.210
Anytime you see somebody with a
yellow ribbon on the tree, Eileen...

52:50.310 --> 52:52.946
a yellow ribbon,
that means a memoriam.

52:53.046 --> 52:54.248
Don't you know what that means?

52:54.348 --> 52:56.717
Everybody in the USA knows
what a memoriam is...

52:56.817 --> 52:58.819
when you see a yellow
ribbon on a damn tree.

52:58.919 --> 53:00.487
You work on my nerves.

53:00.587 --> 53:03.890
That poor woman is probably crying
'cause you cut down her daddy's tree.

53:03.990 --> 53:05.959
What wrong with you,
cutting down her daddy's tree?

53:06.059 --> 53:08.128
You know what's gonna happen?
I'm gonna make this plain.

53:08.228 --> 53:10.130
You're gonna go to bed,
slip into a coma...

53:10.230 --> 53:11.965
and everybody gonna wonder
what happened to you.

53:12.065 --> 53:14.635
I did it. It's Christmas, damn it!

53:14.735 --> 53:17.671
I don't know, Buddy.
I don't think I can deal with this.

53:17.771 --> 53:20.107
I don't like it. It's wrong.

53:20.207 --> 53:24.211
I can't pretend to be somebody.
I'm not an actress. I'm not Reba.

53:24.311 --> 53:27.080
Maybe we should just leave.
Let's pack up and leave tomorrow.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.082
No, we're not going back home.
We're staying here.

53:29.182 --> 53:30.751
- It's Christmas.
- And that woman...

53:30.851 --> 53:34.655
she cuts down my daddy's memory tree
and acts like she doesn't even care!

53:34.755 --> 53:36.723
Honey, I know. It stinks. I get it.

53:36.823 --> 53:38.792
You know what?
We'll get you another tree.

53:38.892 --> 53:41.928
I want that tree. I want my
daddy's tree. What about our son?

53:42.028 --> 53:44.598
Conner just stands there and doesn't
say anything back to this woman.

53:44.698 --> 53:47.668
He's just pretending,
just saying nothin' to this woman.

53:47.768 --> 53:51.538
Sweetheart, you know our kid.
He can't tell no to anybody.

53:51.638 --> 53:53.106
Let him figure it out.

53:53.206 --> 53:54.941
- You want some of this?
- No, not now.

53:55.041 --> 53:58.178
- You know you want some of this.
- I don't. It's too much for me.

53:58.278 --> 54:00.180
Remember that game we
played when we was kids?

54:00.280 --> 54:02.249
- Mystery Date?
- No, the Ghost and the Damsel.

54:02.349 --> 54:04.318
- You remember that?
- Buddy Williams...

54:04.418 --> 54:07.454
We are not playing... This is not the
time or the place. Don't you dare.

54:07.554 --> 54:09.823
Go take a cold shower
and get off of me.

54:09.923 --> 54:11.792
Go throw some milk on that thing.

54:11.892 --> 54:14.472
I think I left my bag in...

54:15.429 --> 54:17.509
one of my bags here.

54:23.003 --> 54:24.938
- You think she noticed me?
- Yes!

54:25.038 --> 54:27.675
- Yes!
- Oh, damn.

54:30.477 --> 54:33.880
How to stop diabetes before it starts.
That's what AARP talking about.

54:33.980 --> 54:36.060
You got to read this,
this is pretty good.

54:47.881 --> 54:49.483
- Hi.
- Hey.

54:50.083 --> 54:51.821
Heard about the sponsorship?

54:52.586 --> 54:54.555
Yeah, just found out about it.

54:54.655 --> 54:57.124
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

54:57.224 --> 54:59.463
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

55:02.930 --> 55:05.666
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

55:05.766 --> 55:09.177
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

55:10.270 --> 55:11.849
Unbelievable.

55:16.892 --> 55:18.361
Eileen, what you doin'?

55:18.461 --> 55:19.962
I knew it.

55:20.062 --> 55:22.231
He's in the Ku Klux Klan.

55:22.331 --> 55:23.910
What?

55:24.400 --> 55:28.003
He was wearing the sheet
when I went in the room.

55:28.103 --> 55:30.039
Them people are not
in no Ku Klux Klan.

55:30.139 --> 55:31.907
I saw the Klan today.
That ain't the Klan.

55:32.007 --> 55:35.511
- They probably trying to make up the bed.
- I know the Klan when I see it.

55:35.611 --> 55:37.980
There you go, overreacting,
like you always do.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.558
- Yes, he is.
- Always jump to conclusions.

55:41.317 --> 55:42.718
Stop jumping to conclusions.

55:42.818 --> 55:45.228
No, baby. No.

55:45.821 --> 55:47.289
I know what I saw.

55:47.389 --> 55:49.425
Eileen, you gonna
get your pressure up.

55:49.525 --> 55:54.063
I'm gonna sleep with
one eye open tonight.

55:54.163 --> 55:58.401
Yes. Oh, Lord, my poor daughter,
she's so naive.

55:58.501 --> 56:01.270
She don't know what's going on.
She don't have a clue.

56:01.370 --> 56:04.173
You don't have a clue, talkin'
about sleeping with one eye open.

56:04.273 --> 56:06.942
I hope it's not the lazy one,
'cause that one always look closed.

56:07.042 --> 56:08.844
Them people are not in the Klan.

56:08.944 --> 56:11.113
You put all of this stuff
in front of that door.

56:11.213 --> 56:12.848
All that stuff in
front the damn door.

56:12.948 --> 56:16.185
I go to the bathroom, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, 10, 12 times a night...

56:16.285 --> 56:18.187
and if I laugh too hard,
I squirt pee.

56:18.287 --> 56:19.989
You got to move that stuff.

56:20.089 --> 56:23.466
How can I go to the bathroom at
night with all that in front the door?

56:26.295 --> 56:27.997
What this?

56:28.097 --> 56:30.871
- I can't sit on this cup!
- Then stand up.

57:09.805 --> 57:11.273
Conner, I'm sorry.

57:11.373 --> 57:13.919
- Can I ask you something?
- What's that?

57:16.011 --> 57:18.581
- Are you ashamed of me?
- No.

57:18.681 --> 57:20.816
Then why won't you tell her?

57:20.916 --> 57:24.987
I've never let my mother
down my entire life. Okay?

57:25.087 --> 57:28.991
I've done everything
she wanted. Always.

57:29.091 --> 57:32.035
And this is the first time I've
done something that I want.

57:33.562 --> 57:35.631
Conner, it's gonna break her heart.

57:35.731 --> 57:37.199
You gotta understand that.

57:37.299 --> 57:39.802
You have to understand
how this makes me feel.

57:39.902 --> 57:43.381
I love you. I'm proud of us.
I don't care who knows.

57:47.543 --> 57:50.715
- Are you coming to bed?
- You mean the sofa, right?

57:51.313 --> 57:53.716
You know the walls are thin.

57:53.816 --> 57:56.021
My patience is getting
there with this.

58:04.927 --> 58:07.863
And I told her, "You better
get the hell on out the way."

58:07.963 --> 58:10.232
Lord, that was funny.
Your mama was something else.

58:10.332 --> 58:12.070
Here you are, Miss Murphy.

58:13.435 --> 58:15.638
Three little eggs.

58:15.738 --> 58:17.545
Mama, it's fine.

58:18.474 --> 58:20.175
Would you like some coffee, Conner?

58:20.275 --> 58:23.322
No, I gotta tend to the animals.

58:27.016 --> 58:29.351
I can give you a few
pointers if you want to.

58:29.451 --> 58:31.353
- Yeah, that would be great.
- Okay, great.

58:31.453 --> 58:33.533
All right. I'll be outside
if y'all need me.

58:34.123 --> 58:36.759
What kind of farmhand
don't know about farmin'?

58:36.859 --> 58:39.662
- He knows the science of it, Mama.
- No, I heard that last night.

58:39.762 --> 58:42.097
Wait. Why are you
always defending him?

58:42.197 --> 58:44.777
'Cause she like him.

58:46.201 --> 58:48.938
Over my dead body will she end
up with somebody like that.

58:49.038 --> 58:50.549
Somebody like what?

58:51.340 --> 58:54.910
I don't wanna talk about it. We don't
make those kind of jokes, okay?

58:55.010 --> 58:57.046
Hush up, Dragon Lady.
Hush the hell up.

58:57.146 --> 59:00.516
If she like him, she like him.
That's all that is. Just hush.

59:00.616 --> 59:02.418
Excuse me. Good morning, y'all.

59:02.518 --> 59:05.921
This room brings back
so many memories.

59:06.021 --> 59:07.890
Smells like farm.

59:07.990 --> 59:09.458
Good morning, Miss Mandela.

59:09.558 --> 59:11.535
Not Mandela, honey. Madea.

59:12.461 --> 59:14.763
Madea, honey. Hi, sweetheart.

59:14.863 --> 59:16.799
Mrs. Williams,
would you like some coffee?

59:16.899 --> 59:20.135
- I'm gonna get it myself.
- Don't you have to go to school?

59:20.235 --> 59:23.405
Actually, I do. I'm on my way.
I'll talk to you later.

59:23.505 --> 59:25.107
Bye, Miss Mandela.

59:25.808 --> 59:28.844
I had such a crazy,
crazy-ass dream last night.

59:28.944 --> 59:30.946
- Really?
- Yeah. What are you cooking?

59:31.046 --> 59:33.983
- Can I help? I'm good in the kitchen.
- No, I don't need your help.

59:34.083 --> 59:35.059
Eileen!

59:35.984 --> 59:38.155
What? I don't need her help.

59:39.588 --> 59:43.058
I understand. I like to cook
alone myself sometimes too.

59:43.158 --> 59:44.627
- Thank you.
- All right then.

59:44.727 --> 59:45.862
- Thank you.
- Okay.

59:46.462 --> 59:47.930
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

59:48.030 --> 59:49.999
That ain't being Christian,
being that mean to that woman.

59:50.099 --> 59:52.736
I don't eat food from the KKK.

59:53.335 --> 59:56.405
That woman ain't in no KKK.
Hush that foolishness. Hell.

59:56.505 --> 59:58.774
- I love you, Son.
- Love you too.

59:58.874 --> 01:00:00.476
Stay warm, okay?

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:10.497
- Stop babying him.
- You need to start babying him.

01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.088
What's the matter with you?

01:00:13.188 --> 01:00:15.791
You did not need to be so
mean to that woman yesterday.

01:00:15.891 --> 01:00:18.093
She don't need to be
coming around here.

01:00:18.193 --> 01:00:21.030
She seems nice. She just
wants the best for Bailey.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.766
I know what's the best for Bailey,
and that's keeping this place running.

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:25.501
He can learn something in school.

01:00:25.601 --> 01:00:28.037
Maybe become something
more than the two of us.

01:00:28.137 --> 01:00:31.013
Yeah? Well, school is
gonna have to wait.

01:00:32.574 --> 01:00:34.376
Gotta get these "poinsetters" sold.

01:00:34.476 --> 01:00:37.813
Think I'm gonna go down to Harrisburg.
Try sell 'em over there.

01:00:37.913 --> 01:00:40.749
If you would have talked to Lacey,
you would've found out...

01:00:40.849 --> 01:00:43.986
that she has got sponsorship for
the Jubilee, so it is happening.

01:00:44.086 --> 01:00:46.455
So you can sell your
poinsettias at the Jubilee.

01:00:46.555 --> 01:00:48.760
- Who's the sponsor?
- I don't know.

01:00:52.127 --> 01:00:54.196
Who does she think she is?

01:00:54.296 --> 01:00:56.298
What you mad for, huh?

01:00:56.398 --> 01:00:58.400
The Jubilee is happening.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:01.537
We don't need her help.
She ain't from around here.

01:01:01.637 --> 01:01:04.873
- Well, that's just plain dumb.
- You watch your back talk, Amber.

01:01:04.973 --> 01:01:07.349
And you watch your
front talk, Tanner.

01:01:12.681 --> 01:01:14.283
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:01:14.883 --> 01:01:16.621
Heard about the sponsorship?

01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:19.355
Yeah, just found out about it.

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:21.924
- We got a problem.
- What's that?

01:01:22.024 --> 01:01:24.263
Sponsor is Sheldon Construction.

01:01:27.730 --> 01:01:30.466
Same Sheldon Construction that built
the dam that put us all out of business?

01:01:30.566 --> 01:01:33.977
- That's the one.
- Hell no. You see?

01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:36.649
Unbelievable.

01:01:39.353 --> 01:01:41.856
There is no such thing
as "just a farm boy."

01:01:41.956 --> 01:01:45.265
You are smart. You can
be anything you want.

01:01:46.694 --> 01:01:49.931
I can only imagine if you could
just stay awake in class.

01:01:50.031 --> 01:01:52.667
- Are you up late at night?
- No, ma'am.

01:01:52.767 --> 01:01:56.405
I want you to sing the lead
solo at the Christmas Jubilee.

01:01:57.371 --> 01:01:59.273
I'm sorry. I can't do that.

01:01:59.373 --> 01:02:01.783
- Yes, you can.
- No.

01:02:03.544 --> 01:02:05.851
You know what? I really
gotta go, Miss Williams.

01:02:07.415 --> 01:02:09.791
My daddy's gonna be
waiting for me at home.

01:02:12.643 --> 01:02:15.349
Child, these nipples so tough,
you need a mammogram.

01:02:15.846 --> 01:02:17.983
Don't look at me like that.

01:02:18.582 --> 01:02:20.684
- But you giving milk.
- Well, hello.

01:02:21.485 --> 01:02:23.064
Hey there.

01:02:24.288 --> 01:02:26.790
- How are ya?
- Thems pigs was starving to death.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:29.593
I slopped them, and I've been
trying to get milk for Eileen.

01:02:29.693 --> 01:02:32.129
- She's in there trying to cook something.
- Look, he's trying.

01:02:32.229 --> 01:02:35.332
- We sure do appreciate you helpin'.
- No. That's fine.

01:02:35.432 --> 01:02:38.469
I'll show him how to do it when he
come out of that laboratory thing.

01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:41.104
Look like he growing marijuana.
He ain't growing marijuana, is he?

01:02:41.204 --> 01:02:44.074
No, he ain't doing that.
Look, he's a smart kid, you know.

01:02:44.174 --> 01:02:46.481
He just, well...

01:02:47.744 --> 01:02:49.646
- What?
- I'm a truck driver.

01:02:49.746 --> 01:02:52.216
I'm out on the road a lot,
you know, and...

01:02:52.316 --> 01:02:55.486
he always stayed with his mom
and his grandparents here.

01:02:55.586 --> 01:02:58.655
I tell you what, it broke my
heart to be gone so much...

01:02:58.755 --> 01:03:02.860
but I just kind of feel a little
guilty about the way he turned out.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.429
- How he turn out?
- Kind of passive, I guess.

01:03:05.529 --> 01:03:07.731
Kind of lets people
walk all over him.

01:03:07.831 --> 01:03:11.935
I mean, he used to get beat
up a lot in school, bullied.

01:03:12.035 --> 01:03:13.704
- Oh, he's soft.
- He's soft.

01:03:13.804 --> 01:03:16.340
This kid, Tanner, used to
beat him up all the time.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.342
And he still lives here, that Tanner.

01:03:18.442 --> 01:03:21.044
When a person gets tired of a bully,
they handle it, you understand?

01:03:21.144 --> 01:03:24.581
You shut it down and you realize that
you ain't gonna deal with it no more.

01:03:24.681 --> 01:03:27.284
- Boy, that's the truth.
- Gotta wait for that.

01:03:27.384 --> 01:03:29.720
Hey, we were just talking about you.

01:03:29.820 --> 01:03:31.288
- Yeah?
- It was all good stuff.

01:03:31.388 --> 01:03:33.357
- All good stuff.
- Good.

01:03:33.457 --> 01:03:36.094
That one, she just will
not let you milk her.

01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:39.666
- The black-and-white one?
- Yep.

01:03:41.798 --> 01:03:45.402
There's a reason why you couldn't get
milk from the black-and-white one, son.

01:03:47.437 --> 01:03:50.074
If somebody pull on your testicles,
will you give 'em milk?

01:03:51.241 --> 01:03:52.342
Don't answer that.

01:03:52.442 --> 01:03:55.145
That's a bull.
You can't milk no bull.

01:03:55.245 --> 01:03:57.325
You serious, trying to milk a bull?

01:03:58.448 --> 01:03:59.618
Blessed.

01:04:00.784 --> 01:04:03.320
Son, you got to slop them
pigs early in the morning.

01:04:03.420 --> 01:04:06.823
Then you gotta milk these cows
'cause they nipples is tough.

01:04:06.923 --> 01:04:09.526
And you can't be gentle.
You got to pull them nipples.

01:04:09.626 --> 01:04:11.695
You got to pull them things.
Pull 'em hard.

01:04:11.795 --> 01:04:14.231
Pull 'em. Pull 'em. Pull 'em.

01:04:14.331 --> 01:04:18.709
You're used to that. Hell, his mama
breast-fed him until he was in ninth grade.

01:04:19.703 --> 01:04:23.250
Shut your mouth! Ninth grade?
Her nipples ought to have corrosion.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:26.209
Yeah. That's right.
You ought to see them things.

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:28.478
They look like cake decorator bags.

01:04:28.578 --> 01:04:31.448
Dad, stop it. Come on.

01:04:31.548 --> 01:04:35.152
Y'all, sometimes I just think
I'm not cut out for this.

01:04:35.252 --> 01:04:38.663
Well, hey, it's just a nipple!

01:04:39.256 --> 01:04:41.158
Daddy, I'm talking about farming.

01:04:41.258 --> 01:04:43.060
Well, hey, farming's hard, Son.

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.069
Yes, farming's hard.
You know what else is hard?

01:04:45.729 --> 01:04:47.030
Keeping up a lie...

01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:49.766
'cause the longer you let it live,
the harder it is to kill.

01:04:49.866 --> 01:04:51.668
- Ain't that right?
- You got that right.

01:04:51.768 --> 01:04:53.604
You're a smart woman.

01:04:53.704 --> 01:04:56.607
- What are you talkin' about?
- What am I talkin' about?

01:04:56.707 --> 01:04:58.508
I'm talking about you and Lacey.

01:04:58.608 --> 01:05:00.744
You wanna tell Eileen, or you
want me to tell her y'all together?

01:05:00.844 --> 01:05:02.981
- Daddy!
- Hey, I didn't say nothin'.

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.248
- Who told you?
- You just did.

01:05:05.348 --> 01:05:07.384
Whole body language. Tensed up.

01:05:07.484 --> 01:05:09.886
When I walked in the house
the other day, I saw them shoes.

01:05:09.986 --> 01:05:12.322
I see the way you look at her,
the way she look at you.

01:05:12.422 --> 01:05:14.958
- Y'all need to say something.
- It's not me. I wanna tell her.

01:05:15.058 --> 01:05:17.961
It's Lacey. She says she doesn't
think she can handle it.

01:05:18.061 --> 01:05:20.297
We just need a defibrillator.
She gonna have a heart attack.

01:05:20.397 --> 01:05:22.032
She gonna clutch the pearls and die.

01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:24.201
But we'll get a defibrillator.
She'll be all right.

01:05:24.301 --> 01:05:26.381
But it's all right.
Y'all just dating.

01:05:27.204 --> 01:05:28.339
Dating?

01:05:29.973 --> 01:05:31.552
They're married.

01:05:32.075 --> 01:05:33.586
Oh, she dead.

01:05:34.344 --> 01:05:35.752
Flatline. Just...

01:05:37.380 --> 01:05:39.983
Dead. Lord have mercy,
that's going to kill her.

01:05:40.083 --> 01:05:42.419
Lacey said she's gonna
tell her on Christmas.

01:05:42.519 --> 01:05:44.421
She fixin' to kill her
mama on Christmas Day?

01:05:44.521 --> 01:05:47.124
- What kind of Christmas present is that?
- Oh, damn.

01:05:48.058 --> 01:05:50.027
Y'all better have some
nitroglycerin or something.

01:05:50.127 --> 01:05:52.095
That's a damn shame.
Gonna kill that woman on...

01:05:52.195 --> 01:05:54.275
Hell, I'm stuck in the mud.

01:05:56.867 --> 01:05:58.168
Hell, this ain't mud!

01:05:58.268 --> 01:06:00.814
- You all right?
- I done fell in bull...

01:06:04.908 --> 01:06:07.579
Keep going. Help each other out.

01:06:09.012 --> 01:06:11.415
- Hi. What's going on?
- It's bad.

01:06:11.515 --> 01:06:13.316
Oliver called and told the mayor...

01:06:13.416 --> 01:06:17.421
that we couldn't have any references
to the nativity or Jesus.

01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:20.257
- What?
- The sponsors don't want it.

01:06:20.357 --> 01:06:22.959
No. No, something
is wrong. I'll call him.

01:06:23.059 --> 01:06:25.139
Well, the mayor wants to see you now.

01:06:26.263 --> 01:06:28.172
- Come on.
- Okay.

01:06:29.332 --> 01:06:31.070
Who does he think he is?

01:06:32.769 --> 01:06:34.538
All right! That's enough!

01:06:34.638 --> 01:06:36.807
That's enough!

01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:38.642
One at a time!

01:06:38.742 --> 01:06:40.377
I'm very upset.

01:06:40.477 --> 01:06:42.879
She is trying to take
Christ out of Christmas.

01:06:42.979 --> 01:06:45.716
Next thing you know they'll
wanna take prayer out of church!

01:06:45.816 --> 01:06:47.784
You see what happened when
they took prayer out of schools.

01:06:47.884 --> 01:06:48.852
We did.

01:06:48.952 --> 01:06:51.221
Wilbur, what does it say?

01:06:51.321 --> 01:06:54.858
Well, the contract says...
no nativity.

01:06:54.958 --> 01:06:57.494
No Jesus reference whatsoever.

01:06:57.594 --> 01:06:59.996
Not even a little drummer boy.

01:07:00.096 --> 01:07:01.565
Unbelievable.

01:07:01.665 --> 01:07:03.667
Why didn't it say that the
first time you read it?

01:07:03.767 --> 01:07:05.936
Well, it was in the small print.

01:07:06.036 --> 01:07:08.004
I didn't have my glasses on.

01:07:08.104 --> 01:07:10.540
I didn't have my glasses on!
I couldn't see!

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.375
- This is awful!
- Wait.

01:07:12.475 --> 01:07:14.555
This has got to be a mistake.

01:07:15.178 --> 01:07:17.280
Let me call Oliver. How about that?

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.683
All righty. You go right ahead.

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:21.918
I've already talked to him
about this, but have at it.

01:07:22.018 --> 01:07:23.426
Okay.

01:07:24.354 --> 01:07:26.365
- Put it on speaker.
- Yeah.

01:07:26.857 --> 01:07:28.436
Okay.

01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:38.702
Hello?

01:07:38.802 --> 01:07:42.105
- Hi Oliver.
- Hey. Guess you talked to the mayor.

01:07:42.205 --> 01:07:45.275
Yes, we are all here on speakerphone.

01:07:45.375 --> 01:07:47.577
Yeah, I don't see
what the big deal is.

01:07:47.677 --> 01:07:50.480
They want it to be called Holiday
Jubilee instead of Christmas.

01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:52.783
Yeah, and they don't need
references to religious figures.

01:07:52.883 --> 01:07:55.786
How do we talk about Christmas
without talking about Jesus?

01:07:55.886 --> 01:07:58.121
- Yeah, how do we?
- It happens all the time,

01:07:58.221 --> 01:08:00.190
Santa Claus is okay.

01:08:00.290 --> 01:08:02.961
Make it about Santa Claus and
not about the birth of Christ.

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.231
And the songs for the Jubilee should
be about everything but Christ.

01:08:08.331 --> 01:08:11.501
Sing songs like Here Comes
Santa Claus, White Christmas.

01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:13.036
White Christmas.

01:08:13.136 --> 01:08:16.038
There ain't nothing white about
a Bucktussle, Alabama Christmas!

01:08:16.139 --> 01:08:17.874
- It don't snow here!
- That's right.

01:08:17.974 --> 01:08:21.044
Okay, Oliver, we did not
sign up for this. Okay?

01:08:21.144 --> 01:08:22.612
Yes, you did.

01:08:22.712 --> 01:08:24.917
I am a Christian,
and this is some bull...

01:08:28.518 --> 01:08:30.787
The heads of the company are
coming down on a private jet...

01:08:30.886 --> 01:08:32.022
A private jet.

01:08:32.122 --> 01:08:33.857
To be filmed with the
school at the Jubilee,

01:08:33.957 --> 01:08:35.992
I did you a favor here,
and this will ruin me.

01:08:36.091 --> 01:08:37.993
You can't do this to me now.

01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:42.165
I can't just turn them around.
You have to figure this one out.

01:08:42.265 --> 01:08:44.667
- You hold on there, son.
- That's right. You get it straight.

01:08:44.768 --> 01:08:47.671
With all due respect, Mr. Mayor,
you got the money and we have a deal.

01:08:47.770 --> 01:08:49.738
- Give him his money back.
- Yeah.

01:08:49.839 --> 01:08:51.308
- We spent it.
- Yeah.

01:08:51.408 --> 01:08:53.042
- On what?
- The Jubilee!

01:08:53.143 --> 01:08:56.712
And much-needed school supplies.
And catching up on school bills.

01:08:56.813 --> 01:08:59.616
Listen, I'm sorry, but we're coming.

01:08:59.716 --> 01:09:02.051
This is my career
you're talking about.

01:09:02.152 --> 01:09:03.731
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:09:04.321 --> 01:09:06.456
Move, move. Now, watch out.

01:09:06.555 --> 01:09:10.594
Well, now this is a fine
mess you've gotten us into.

01:09:10.694 --> 01:09:12.162
She should be fired.

01:09:12.261 --> 01:09:14.531
- Now hold on a second.
- Mr. Mayor...

01:09:14.631 --> 01:09:16.099
have you heard?

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:18.167
We were talking about the
changes they want made.

01:09:18.268 --> 01:09:21.975
That's not what I was talking about.
I was talking about the sponsor.

01:09:22.772 --> 01:09:24.674
- Sheldon Construction.
- What?

01:09:24.774 --> 01:09:26.243
That's right.

01:09:26.343 --> 01:09:27.810
The same folks...

01:09:27.911 --> 01:09:31.147
that built a dam to save Jasper
and left us without a river.

01:09:31.247 --> 01:09:33.250
She brought this mess here
and she should be fired.

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:35.151
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring...

01:09:35.251 --> 01:09:38.921
We don't care what the
hell you meant. Do we?

01:09:39.022 --> 01:09:40.523
- No.
- I didn't think so.

01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:42.658
You brought an awful situation here.

01:09:42.759 --> 01:09:44.861
Get out of here and let us handle it.

01:09:44.961 --> 01:09:47.264
- Go back to wherever you come from.
- Now hold on.

01:09:47.363 --> 01:09:49.171
You do not have to
talk to her like that.

01:09:49.832 --> 01:09:51.412
Mr. Mayor.

01:09:52.335 --> 01:09:54.604
You fire her. Right now.

01:09:54.704 --> 01:09:56.545
Do it.

01:09:58.008 --> 01:10:01.646
- Lacey, I'm sorry.
- There we go.

01:10:03.646 --> 01:10:05.225
I understand.

01:10:08.651 --> 01:10:11.021
You believe that? Sheldon.

01:10:11.121 --> 01:10:13.030
This is a hell of a mess.

01:10:23.266 --> 01:10:25.403
You all do your homework, okay?

01:10:26.903 --> 01:10:30.177
And... be good for your new teacher.

01:10:32.242 --> 01:10:33.821
Where are you going?

01:10:36.246 --> 01:10:37.984
I made a mistake...

01:10:39.115 --> 01:10:40.917
and now I have to leave.

01:10:41.017 --> 01:10:44.894
No. I'll sing. I'll do the solo.

01:10:45.555 --> 01:10:49.059
I don't think there's gonna be
a Christmas Jubilee this year.

01:10:49.159 --> 01:10:51.161
I don't want you to go.

01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:53.563
Bailey, you are so special.

01:10:53.663 --> 01:10:56.141
You always remember that.

01:10:57.901 --> 01:11:00.337
- Okay?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:11:00.437 --> 01:11:02.016
You all are.

01:11:04.307 --> 01:11:05.886
I'll see you.

01:11:07.410 --> 01:11:10.047
- I'm so sorry.
- It's fine.

01:11:14.584 --> 01:11:16.254
Good job, boys.

01:11:24.094 --> 01:11:26.062
I just got done telling Madea...

01:11:26.162 --> 01:11:29.299
that you was in here all alone
with Eileen, and she said that...

01:11:29.399 --> 01:11:32.446
I said you was in here with
the beast of the southern wild.

01:11:34.003 --> 01:11:36.206
I tried. That woman is stubborn.

01:11:36.306 --> 01:11:38.875
I tried. I asked her if
I could help her cook.

01:11:38.975 --> 01:11:40.443
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

01:11:40.543 --> 01:11:42.445
Yeah, I know. She's difficult.

01:11:42.545 --> 01:11:44.514
It's all right. She got a problem,
but it's all right.

01:11:44.614 --> 01:11:46.783
- Y'all want some lemonade?
- No, I'm good.

01:11:46.883 --> 01:11:48.518
- I'm good. Thank you.
- There you are.

01:11:48.618 --> 01:11:51.021
I've been worried about you.

01:11:51.121 --> 01:11:54.090
You were out there
with them for a while.

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:56.159
Yeah. I was conflicted.

01:11:56.259 --> 01:12:00.897
I didn't know if I should look
for you or watch the food.

01:12:00.997 --> 01:12:03.600
I didn't let her near our food.

01:12:04.534 --> 01:12:08.571
You whisper like a damn bullhorn.
That woman ain't gonna hurt us.

01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:10.640
We don't know that, do we?

01:12:10.740 --> 01:12:12.375
What y'all talking about over there?

01:12:12.475 --> 01:12:14.782
She just thinks y'all
are tryin' to kill us.

01:12:16.279 --> 01:12:17.781
- Tryin' to kill you?
- Good heavens!

01:12:17.881 --> 01:12:20.350
- You're nuts!
- I've never hurt a flea or a fly.

01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:22.419
I've seen her shoot
a deer once though.

01:12:22.519 --> 01:12:25.822
I never. I would never shoot little
Bambi sipping water in a pond.

01:12:25.922 --> 01:12:28.858
I'm just gonna ask y'all.
I'm gonna put it out on the table.

01:12:28.958 --> 01:12:30.326
- Be honest.
- What is it?

01:12:30.426 --> 01:12:32.164
Y'all in the Ku Klux Klan?

01:12:32.962 --> 01:12:34.931
- That's what she wanna know.
- Get outta here!

01:12:35.031 --> 01:12:37.000
Heavens no. Why would she...

01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:39.869
- Buddy, the other night with the sheet.
- Oh, with the sheet!

01:12:39.969 --> 01:12:41.471
Yes! Explain that.

01:12:41.571 --> 01:12:43.540
We used to play this game, all right?

01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:45.542
Buddy and I, when we
were young, he would...

01:12:45.642 --> 01:12:48.278
It was called the
Ghost and the Damsel.

01:12:48.378 --> 01:12:50.346
And he would blindfold me.

01:12:50.446 --> 01:12:52.916
Then he'd put a sheet
above himself...

01:12:53.016 --> 01:12:55.051
and then I would have
to search about...

01:12:55.151 --> 01:12:57.187
and capture the rapture,
if you know what I mean.

01:12:57.287 --> 01:12:58.855
Mama!

01:12:58.955 --> 01:13:00.457
I am sorry, Conner.

01:13:00.557 --> 01:13:02.826
- That's just nasty.
- Sorry, Son.

01:13:02.926 --> 01:13:05.061
- But I like it.
- I know.

01:13:05.161 --> 01:13:07.530
It can be fun. It can be.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:10.467
That is so inappropriate.

01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:14.137
You two need to learn how to
respect my daughter's house.

01:13:15.004 --> 01:13:17.774
- Eileen, you might wanna let that go.
- No.

01:13:17.874 --> 01:13:19.943
They come in here taking
advantage of her...

01:13:20.043 --> 01:13:23.446
eating her food, and they're
acting like they own the place.

01:13:23.546 --> 01:13:25.715
- I don't like it.
- You need to let that go.

01:13:25.815 --> 01:13:28.418
Well, I don't like...

01:13:28.518 --> 01:13:30.687
- Mama...
- that you...

01:13:30.787 --> 01:13:32.255
Mama, sit down.

01:13:32.355 --> 01:13:34.891
You cut down my family's memory tree.

01:13:34.991 --> 01:13:36.960
That's what I don't like.

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.561
Excuse me?

01:13:38.661 --> 01:13:41.664
I can deal with a lot of things.
They know it.

01:13:41.764 --> 01:13:44.200
But this is downright wrong...

01:13:44.300 --> 01:13:47.244
and now I am getting very upset!

01:13:48.004 --> 01:13:51.241
Why would you plant his memory
tree on my daughter's land...

01:13:51.341 --> 01:13:53.309
and how was I supposed to know that?

01:13:53.409 --> 01:13:55.378
Oh, I don't know.

01:13:55.478 --> 01:13:58.481
Maybe because it had a
yellow ribbon around it?

01:13:58.581 --> 01:14:00.183
That doesn't mean anything.

01:14:00.283 --> 01:14:03.720
In most countries, in most places,
to sane-thinking people...

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:06.489
a yellow ribbon means something.

01:14:06.589 --> 01:14:10.560
Now you just calm down, missy. Okay?

01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.664
Now, Lacey, are you gonna
let her talk to me like this?

01:14:14.764 --> 01:14:16.666
- Mama, calm down.
- Put your finger down...

01:14:16.766 --> 01:14:19.005
or I will cut it off and deep-fry it!

01:14:20.303 --> 01:14:22.839
You need to leave my
daughter's house.

01:14:22.939 --> 01:14:24.807
- Mama, stop it! Stop!
- No!

01:14:24.907 --> 01:14:26.776
Eileen, you need to
stop right now, honey.

01:14:26.876 --> 01:14:29.712
What are they doing here anyway?
Tomorrow is Christmas!

01:14:29.812 --> 01:14:31.347
They are not your family!

01:14:31.447 --> 01:14:33.683
- Let's get out of here.
- No, hold up.

01:14:33.783 --> 01:14:36.085
Come on back here.
Ain't nobody going nowhere.

01:14:36.185 --> 01:14:38.821
- Now, Madea...
- Ain't nobody goin' no damn where.

01:14:38.921 --> 01:14:40.890
Madea, whose side are you on?

01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:43.359
- Let 'em leave.
- No, I'm on the side of right.

01:14:43.459 --> 01:14:45.562
- That's the side I'm on. Lacey?
- Yes.

01:14:45.662 --> 01:14:48.665
- Tell your mama.
- What? Tell me what?

01:14:48.765 --> 01:14:52.005
Spit it out before I punch you,
put your teeth down your throat!

01:14:54.537 --> 01:14:57.481
Mama... Conner and I are married.

01:15:01.577 --> 01:15:03.987
- Catch her.
- Get the defibrillator.

01:15:09.185 --> 01:15:11.731
Lacey. Your father.

01:15:12.689 --> 01:15:15.692
I know, Mama. I know he was
murdered by a white man, but...

01:15:15.792 --> 01:15:17.293
- What happened?
- What?

01:15:17.393 --> 01:15:20.663
My father was killed by a
white man on Christmas Eve...

01:15:20.763 --> 01:15:22.565
trying to protect my mother's honor.

01:15:22.665 --> 01:15:24.667
- That's awful.
- Good Lord.

01:15:24.767 --> 01:15:27.770
- Who told you that?
- Mama.

01:15:27.870 --> 01:15:31.040
Eileen, you oughta be ashamed...
Child, that's some straight-up bull...

01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:32.548
Madea!

01:15:33.142 --> 01:15:35.722
Your daddy wasn't
killed by no white man.

01:15:36.312 --> 01:15:38.681
He left your mama for a white
woman when you was two...

01:15:38.781 --> 01:15:41.117
and your mama has been bitter
with white people ever since.

01:15:41.217 --> 01:15:42.685
- What?
- Yes, years ago.

01:15:42.785 --> 01:15:47.090
Ran off and joined the circus.
And now they on Glee,

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:48.658
Good show.

01:15:48.758 --> 01:15:51.600
Glee? Mama, is this true?

01:15:52.528 --> 01:15:54.197
Mama!

01:15:54.297 --> 01:15:59.936
Lacey, I am so disappointed in you.

01:16:00.036 --> 01:16:02.412
Look at her trying to
turn it around on you.

01:16:03.406 --> 01:16:04.985
Girl, please.

01:16:09.746 --> 01:16:11.553
You're disappointed in me?

01:16:12.315 --> 01:16:14.550
Well, that went well.

01:16:14.650 --> 01:16:16.957
At least she didn't have
another heart attack.

01:16:18.588 --> 01:16:20.657
- Another one?
- Yeah, Madea.

01:16:20.757 --> 01:16:23.660
Didn't you know that my mother
had a heart attack last year?

01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.895
Your mama lied to you. She had gas.

01:16:25.995 --> 01:16:28.831
Got to the doctor, she was clutching
her heart and the pearls.

01:16:28.931 --> 01:16:31.234
Got there, doctor say it's gas.

01:16:31.334 --> 01:16:34.837
- Wait, what?
- They put one of them rods up there.

01:16:34.937 --> 01:16:37.807
Came flowing out like the River Jordan
and that was it. It was all over.

01:16:37.907 --> 01:16:39.375
I had that once too.

01:16:39.475 --> 01:16:41.978
Put it in there, come out sounding
like brakes coming out of...

01:16:42.078 --> 01:16:44.488
The air pressure coming
out of one of them big rigs.

01:16:45.515 --> 01:16:47.750
There it is. Then they tell
her she had heartburn.

01:16:47.850 --> 01:16:50.586
- She didn't have no heart attack.
- She had heartburn?

01:16:50.686 --> 01:16:53.323
She needs some of that Prilosec OTC.

01:16:54.757 --> 01:16:57.427
She been manipulating you.
She as healthy as an ox.

01:16:57.527 --> 01:16:59.629
Well, that woman's a
pretty pissed off ox.

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:02.109
Don't get behind her.

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:06.502
Don't light a match. Don't get
her next to an open flame.

01:17:06.602 --> 01:17:08.071
We'll all have burnt heads.

01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.842
Yeah, her farts can spell
her name, they so bad.

01:17:13.543 --> 01:17:17.181
- Mama, he got her fired.
- That's all right. I'm upset too.

01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.451
We should go, boy. We got work to do.

01:17:23.386 --> 01:17:25.588
Why'd you do that to Mrs. Williams?

01:17:25.688 --> 01:17:28.658
You know, she's a nice lady.
Why'd you get her fired?

01:17:28.758 --> 01:17:30.793
You don't know what's
going on here, Bailey.

01:17:30.893 --> 01:17:33.396
I know you don't like people
'cause of the way they look.

01:17:33.496 --> 01:17:36.440
That ain't right! That's what
kids do to me at school!

01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:41.009
It ain't fair. She's nice to me.

01:17:42.371 --> 01:17:44.207
Don't you ever...

01:17:44.307 --> 01:17:46.275
talk to me like that again.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.144
You hear me?

01:17:48.244 --> 01:17:50.324
Get out on that plow.

01:17:55.952 --> 01:17:57.920
He is right, and you know it.

01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.922
She made a deal with the devil.

01:18:00.022 --> 01:18:02.859
No, you're actin' more like
the devil than she is.

01:18:02.959 --> 01:18:05.039
And this is Christmas, Tanner.

01:18:16.339 --> 01:18:19.742
This child still sitting out there.
That's just crazy as hell.

01:18:19.842 --> 01:18:21.310
Where y'all going?

01:18:21.410 --> 01:18:23.179
Well, Miss Media,
we're gonna bring her...

01:18:23.279 --> 01:18:24.747
My name is Madea, honey.

01:18:24.847 --> 01:18:26.315
- Madea.
- Thank you.

01:18:26.415 --> 01:18:28.918
We're gonna bring her hot chocolate
to warm her hard, hard heart.

01:18:29.018 --> 01:18:31.257
Hot chocolate does wonders.
It's delicious.

01:18:31.921 --> 01:18:34.791
That's what got y'all in trouble,
the hot chocolate.

01:18:34.891 --> 01:18:36.993
Your son with the hot chocolate.

01:18:37.093 --> 01:18:39.061
I'm telling you. Let me
explain something to you.

01:18:39.161 --> 01:18:40.963
Let me make this clear to y'all.

01:18:41.063 --> 01:18:43.032
Leave her out there.
She is grown, sitting there.

01:18:43.132 --> 01:18:46.102
If she want to come in the house,
she know how to get in. Leave her alone.

01:18:46.202 --> 01:18:48.938
We're gonna go out and try.
We'll talk to her a bit.

01:18:49.038 --> 01:18:50.506
Go on. Go on.

01:18:50.606 --> 01:18:52.542
Okay. You better wear a cup.

01:18:52.642 --> 01:18:54.221
That's comforting.

01:19:01.183 --> 01:19:03.286
Boy, this is something else,
isn't it? It's freezing.

01:19:03.386 --> 01:19:05.388
Remember, Buddy,
kill her with kindness.

01:19:05.488 --> 01:19:07.457
My weenie is an inny right now.

01:19:07.557 --> 01:19:11.093
Try to have as much charm with your
voice as you do with your weenie.

01:19:11.193 --> 01:19:13.896
Well, tell you what.
I ain't used to this cold weather.

01:19:13.996 --> 01:19:16.132
I know. All right?

01:19:16.232 --> 01:19:18.201
I'm gonna have to wipe
with an ice scraper tonight.

01:19:18.301 --> 01:19:20.603
Smile's all in patience.
Ask the Lord.

01:19:20.703 --> 01:19:22.805
Lord, help us. The Serenity Prayer.

01:19:22.905 --> 01:19:26.676
There ain't no cabs out here.
You wanna come back in the house?

01:19:26.776 --> 01:19:28.311
I'm fine right here.

01:19:28.411 --> 01:19:30.889
I made you some pipin' hot chocolate.

01:19:31.547 --> 01:19:34.417
Thank you. I don't
want any chocolate.

01:19:34.517 --> 01:19:36.255
My son likes chocolate.

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.756
Go ahead and laugh. This is awful.

01:19:40.856 --> 01:19:43.593
What's so awful about it?

01:19:43.693 --> 01:19:47.296
What world are you living in?
They are asking for trouble.

01:19:47.396 --> 01:19:48.831
Eileen, I...

01:19:48.931 --> 01:19:51.100
Mrs. Murphy to you.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.170
Miss Murphy, you can take a knife
and cut all three of us right now.

01:19:54.270 --> 01:19:56.239
You know what's gonna happen?
We're gonna bleed red.

01:19:56.339 --> 01:19:58.741
Blood red. We're all the same inside.

01:19:58.841 --> 01:20:00.510
That's true.

01:20:00.610 --> 01:20:03.884
Mrs. Murphy, if I may...

01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:08.951
our children, no matter what we think,
they will live their own lives.

01:20:10.052 --> 01:20:12.655
- The world is changing.
- Not that much.

01:20:12.755 --> 01:20:16.359
It is changing,
and that is a good thing.

01:20:16.459 --> 01:20:20.196
Every generation sees
a little less division...

01:20:20.296 --> 01:20:25.402
and a little more open
minds and open hearts.

01:20:26.535 --> 01:20:29.505
I think we should be
happy and proud...

01:20:29.605 --> 01:20:32.041
that our kids, our children...

01:20:32.141 --> 01:20:35.745
see people as people.

01:20:36.312 --> 01:20:37.647
That was beautiful.

01:20:37.747 --> 01:20:39.815
- That was unbelievable.
- Thank you. I mean it.

01:20:39.915 --> 01:20:42.585
Come in the house and get
to know us. We're good folks.

01:20:42.685 --> 01:20:45.521
I know damn well you hear
me calling you. Eileen!

01:20:45.621 --> 01:20:47.356
Traitor!

01:20:47.456 --> 01:20:49.392
- Satan!
- Judas!

01:20:49.492 --> 01:20:51.093
Beelzebub!

01:20:51.193 --> 01:20:52.695
Come in. It is cold.

01:20:52.795 --> 01:20:55.398
You got these people out here trying
to tempt you back in the house...

01:20:55.498 --> 01:20:58.568
like a wet cat on a cold Sunday
morning who needs some milk.

01:20:58.668 --> 01:21:00.303
Come in the house.
You're out here freezing.

01:21:00.403 --> 01:21:03.806
Your ankles is whiter than snow.
Look like you been kicking flour.

01:21:03.906 --> 01:21:06.247
My gosh, they are white.
Look, we are related.

01:21:07.176 --> 01:21:10.580
I will not step into
that house of lies.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:13.316
The girl is married. You can't
control every minute of her life.

01:21:13.416 --> 01:21:15.151
Do you understand? It is Christmas.

01:21:15.251 --> 01:21:18.721
Give this child the gift of being
able to do whatever she want to do.

01:21:18.821 --> 01:21:21.891
You can't run her life for her.
Do you understand that?

01:21:21.991 --> 01:21:24.560
Ain't no cab comin'. You gonna
be sitting out here freezin'.

01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:27.530
We gonna come out here tomorrow,
you gonna be a black Statue of Liberty...

01:21:27.630 --> 01:21:29.265
just sitting down on your ass.

01:21:29.365 --> 01:21:31.601
Come on in the house!
You know what? That's fine.

01:21:31.701 --> 01:21:33.703
You don't want to come in
'cause you mad about something?

01:21:33.803 --> 01:21:35.805
You can't get everything your way.

01:21:35.905 --> 01:21:39.075
You ever woke up on Christmas morning
and didn't get the gift you wanted?

01:21:39.175 --> 01:21:42.311
This is it. You didn't get the gift you
wanted. Bring your ass in the house.

01:21:42.411 --> 01:21:44.647
Y'all wastin' your time,
'cause she stubborn as a mule.

01:21:44.747 --> 01:21:47.984
I'm going in. You wanna sit out here
and freeze, sit your ass out here...

01:21:48.084 --> 01:21:50.386
sit your ass out here and freeze!

01:21:50.486 --> 01:21:52.622
Sit there as long as you want.
I don't give a damn.

01:21:52.722 --> 01:21:54.690
Sit there and turn
into a damn Popsicle!

01:21:54.790 --> 01:21:57.827
Freeze all the hell you want.
You done lost your damn mind!

01:21:57.927 --> 01:21:59.335
Amen.

01:22:03.065 --> 01:22:06.469
Come on inside. You'll freeze
to death. Ain't no cab coming.

01:22:06.569 --> 01:22:08.871
- I can't believe that.
- We tried our best.

01:22:08.971 --> 01:22:11.007
Let's go in and play
charades with Madea.

01:22:11.107 --> 01:22:13.187
Then I will walk to town.

01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:16.651
And I'll take the Greyhound bus.

01:22:22.084 --> 01:22:25.563
I don't need none of them.
Not one of them.

01:22:30.626 --> 01:22:32.034
Hey.

01:22:33.963 --> 01:22:36.499
Your mama's still out in the cold.
You may want to talk to her.

01:22:36.599 --> 01:22:39.502
- She doesn't want to talk to me.
- You sure about that?

01:22:39.602 --> 01:22:41.237
I know my mother.

01:22:41.337 --> 01:22:43.873
Apparently you don't know
her as well as you think.

01:22:43.973 --> 01:22:45.941
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:22:46.041 --> 01:22:49.512
She's been manipulating
you your entire life.

01:22:49.612 --> 01:22:53.516
She lied to you about your daddy
and about her heart attacks.

01:22:53.616 --> 01:22:55.084
It's just not right.

01:22:55.184 --> 01:22:57.086
Can you stop talking
about my mother now?

01:22:57.186 --> 01:23:00.389
I'm not talkin' about your mother.
I'm just statin' the obvious.

01:23:00.489 --> 01:23:02.291
I'm not trying to attack you or her.

01:23:02.391 --> 01:23:04.527
Good, because I've been
attacked enough today.

01:23:04.627 --> 01:23:08.964
Between my mother and my job and...
It's just all a bit much.

01:23:09.064 --> 01:23:11.667
And everybody's mad at me
because of the sponsor...

01:23:11.767 --> 01:23:14.507
I didn't know it was from
Sheldon Construction Company.

01:23:15.204 --> 01:23:17.284
Tanner McCoy. Yeah, okay.

01:23:18.207 --> 01:23:20.548
- What about Tanner?
- Nothing.

01:23:21.343 --> 01:23:23.719
- Baby.
- I said "nothing."

01:23:24.814 --> 01:23:26.894
What did Tanner do?

01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:31.888
He was so nasty.
And then he got me fired.

01:23:34.723 --> 01:23:36.860
- Conner.
- Son of a bitch.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:40.062
Conner, where are you going?

01:23:40.162 --> 01:23:42.898
- Hey, what's going on?
- I mentioned Tanner and he lost it.

01:23:42.998 --> 01:23:45.468
- Conner!
- I've been waiting to see this.

01:23:45.568 --> 01:23:47.570
- I'm goin' with you, boy.
- Conner!

01:23:54.370 --> 01:23:55.704
Conner!

01:24:05.688 --> 01:24:09.592
Hot dog, it's cold out here.
It's all right. It's all right then.

01:24:09.692 --> 01:24:11.100
Help!

01:24:14.496 --> 01:24:18.934
What in the...
Oh, Jesus, no, you don't.

01:24:19.034 --> 01:24:23.305
- Hey.
- Someone there? Hello?

01:24:23.405 --> 01:24:25.109
I'm here.

01:24:27.643 --> 01:24:29.222
I can't move.

01:24:31.380 --> 01:24:33.517
All right now. We gotta
get outta here. Come on.

01:24:35.017 --> 01:24:36.485
- I'm stuck.
- Can you move your...

01:24:36.585 --> 01:24:38.130
My leg's caught.

01:24:39.321 --> 01:24:40.900
I don't wanna die.

01:24:41.523 --> 01:24:43.603
- Nobody's gonna die.
- I have a little boy.

01:24:45.995 --> 01:24:47.073
Push.

01:24:49.064 --> 01:24:50.900
I got you.

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.102
Got it.

01:24:54.536 --> 01:24:56.206
Go ahead.

01:24:59.008 --> 01:25:00.587
I got you.

01:25:23.799 --> 01:25:27.108
You're good. How are your legs? Okay.

01:25:29.204 --> 01:25:30.673
- How's your head?
- All right.

01:25:30.773 --> 01:25:33.615
All right. Get up. Get up.

01:25:35.444 --> 01:25:37.524
Help. Help.

01:25:39.315 --> 01:25:41.861
Get off my mother-in-law,
you son of a bitch!

01:25:43.118 --> 01:25:45.721
- Hey! Don't hurt him! Stop it!
- Leave him be!

01:25:45.821 --> 01:25:47.356
Come on!

01:25:47.456 --> 01:25:50.893
Don't you ever, ever say a word to
my wife again. You understand me?

01:25:50.993 --> 01:25:53.696
- What did he say about Lacey?
- Get in the truck.

01:25:53.796 --> 01:25:55.698
I will not step foot
back in that house!

01:25:55.798 --> 01:25:57.766
I am not in the mood
for your foolishness.

01:25:57.866 --> 01:25:59.570
Now get your ass in that truck!

01:26:01.904 --> 01:26:03.639
Now I'm plantin' corn...

01:26:03.739 --> 01:26:07.082
and there ain't a damn
thing you can do about it.

01:26:18.187 --> 01:26:19.766
Get out of here.

01:26:34.603 --> 01:26:36.505
Babe, I wish you
wouldn't have done that.

01:26:36.605 --> 01:26:37.907
It had to be done.

01:26:38.007 --> 01:26:40.910
Nothing stops somebody like him from
bullying people except pushing back.

01:26:41.010 --> 01:26:44.647
That's right. That kid's been a terror
to Conner since he was a little boy.

01:26:44.747 --> 01:26:47.516
I'm glad you done what you did, Son.
I'm proud of you.

01:26:47.616 --> 01:26:50.219
Stood up for himself,
and that's a good thing.

01:26:50.319 --> 01:26:51.921
I'm with you, Lacey. I don't like it.

01:26:52.021 --> 01:26:53.989
I just wanna tell you
all how sorry I am.

01:26:54.089 --> 01:26:56.425
I should have told my
mom from the beginning.

01:26:56.525 --> 01:26:59.028
That is the truth.
You should've told her.

01:26:59.128 --> 01:27:01.964
We have met your mama
and we understand.

01:27:02.064 --> 01:27:04.033
She crazy as hell. Didn't I tell you?

01:27:04.133 --> 01:27:06.270
- She's cuckoo.
- That's right.

01:27:07.236 --> 01:27:09.538
I don't like you all
talking about me.

01:27:09.638 --> 01:27:11.273
No, Mrs. Murphy, I'm sorry.

01:27:11.373 --> 01:27:14.109
We were just saying that God
makes everyone different...

01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:17.290
and you are a gem in God's ring.

01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:22.651
And I don't like the
way you spoke to me.

01:27:22.751 --> 01:27:25.454
Well, I'm sorry. I was angry.

01:27:25.554 --> 01:27:29.725
- What did you say?
- He told her to get her ass in the truck.

01:27:29.825 --> 01:27:33.065
- And what did you do?
- She got her ass in the truck.

01:27:34.530 --> 01:27:36.265
Go ahead and laugh.

01:27:36.365 --> 01:27:38.500
Hold on, Eileen.
Y'all need to let all this go.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.570
You lied. She done lie. Everybody lied.
Here a lie, there a lie.

01:27:41.670 --> 01:27:44.573
It's Christmas now. You need to
go down there and buy her a tree.

01:27:44.673 --> 01:27:47.142
And plant it in the backyard.
Get her a ribbon.

01:27:47.242 --> 01:27:48.711
- A yellow one.
- I'm sorry.

01:27:48.811 --> 01:27:51.613
I just wanted to give my
daughter a proper wedding.

01:27:51.713 --> 01:27:54.149
Mama, you've always been overbearing.

01:27:54.249 --> 01:27:57.119
I did it for me. Not for you.

01:27:57.219 --> 01:28:00.055
I love you, and I'm sorry...

01:28:00.155 --> 01:28:02.324
that I didn't tell you,
but this is my life.

01:28:02.424 --> 01:28:06.028
And he loves me,
and he treats me oh so well.

01:28:06.128 --> 01:28:09.264
I'm sorry. I just didn't
want you to get hurt.

01:28:09.364 --> 01:28:13.002
Mama, he's not gonna hurt me.
He's as gentle as a lamb.

01:28:14.736 --> 01:28:17.749
No, he's not. He beat that
man down to the ground.

01:28:18.207 --> 01:28:21.477
Come on. That guy had it comin',
and everybody knows it.

01:28:21.577 --> 01:28:24.487
Well, he did say he
was protecting you.

01:28:25.080 --> 01:28:27.049
I love your daughter, Miss Murphy.

01:28:27.149 --> 01:28:30.285
I'll never let anything
happen to her. I promise.

01:28:30.385 --> 01:28:32.021
That makes two of us.

01:28:32.121 --> 01:28:37.330
Okay. Well, this is all new to me.
I don't know, but... I'll try.

01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:43.165
Nothing beats a failure but a try.

01:28:43.265 --> 01:28:46.101
- Now we're making some progress.
- Yeah.

01:28:46.201 --> 01:28:47.939
A try's a try, right?

01:28:50.072 --> 01:28:53.542
Oh, boy. That's Tanner.
That's trouble.

01:28:53.642 --> 01:28:55.744
He's still got it.
I knew you got it in you.

01:28:55.844 --> 01:28:57.287
- Now, don't.
- Baby...

01:28:58.313 --> 01:29:02.151
You get off my property, Tanner McCoy,
before I knock you on your ass again.

01:29:02.251 --> 01:29:04.753
- Give him a chance.
- He's just coming here to start trouble.

01:29:04.853 --> 01:29:08.662
- No, he's not.
- I want to apologize.

01:29:09.391 --> 01:29:11.960
- What?
- I want to...

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.969
say thank you.

01:29:14.963 --> 01:29:17.373
- I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.
- Eileen.

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:20.002
Miss Eileen.

01:29:20.102 --> 01:29:24.206
He told me what you did
for him. So... thank you.

01:29:24.306 --> 01:29:26.784
Oh, thank you!

01:29:29.111 --> 01:29:30.913
He really is a good man.

01:29:31.013 --> 01:29:32.981
He's just been so troubled...

01:29:33.081 --> 01:29:35.320
with all that's been
going on with the dam.

01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.299
Thank you.

01:29:45.827 --> 01:29:48.063
Tanner, I've been working
on a new strain of corn...

01:29:48.163 --> 01:29:49.965
that doesn't need as much water.

01:29:50.065 --> 01:29:52.577
I could use your help with it.

01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:57.275
Yeah. I'd be glad to.

01:30:04.012 --> 01:30:06.381
I'm sorry I wanted to get you fired.

01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:09.218
I'm gonna talk to the
mayor tomorrow. Promise.

01:30:09.318 --> 01:30:11.286
I'm sure he's still very upset.

01:30:11.386 --> 01:30:15.124
Having to choose between going
on with Jubilee or getting sued...

01:30:15.224 --> 01:30:16.959
is pretty crazy.

01:30:17.059 --> 01:30:19.962
The town's going on with it,
but we're not happy...

01:30:20.062 --> 01:30:23.966
about not being able to say
Jesus or celebrate his birth.

01:30:24.066 --> 01:30:25.968
You know, Bailey's been practicing...

01:30:26.068 --> 01:30:28.648
and all the kids are really sad.

01:30:29.638 --> 01:30:33.015
Yeah, I've been thinking about that,
and I have an idea.

01:30:34.276 --> 01:30:36.778
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells

01:30:36.878 --> 01:30:38.847
Jingle all the way

01:30:38.947 --> 01:30:41.584
- We are live...
- Look at all the news vans.

01:30:43.252 --> 01:30:46.021
This old town has never
had this much attention.

01:30:46.121 --> 01:30:48.790
Well, since the whorehouse
closed down in 1970.

01:30:48.890 --> 01:30:51.960
- That was a sad day.
- What do you think about the celebration?

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:55.130
Well, I say Christmas is about Jesus.

01:30:55.230 --> 01:30:58.834
I ran down here. I ran for my life!

01:30:58.934 --> 01:31:00.969
'Cause I was gonna start a fire.

01:31:01.069 --> 01:31:02.871
"O Lord Jesus is a fire."

01:31:02.971 --> 01:31:04.606
Ain't nobody got time for that.

01:31:04.706 --> 01:31:06.942
- Hell no.
- Hold on there.

01:31:07.042 --> 01:31:09.711
- We need to shut this down.
- Just wait a sec.

01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:11.513
See what she's got to say.

01:31:11.613 --> 01:31:13.949
I told them to hide the kids,
hide they wife...

01:31:14.049 --> 01:31:16.852
and hide they Santa Claus,
'cause it's crazy around here.

01:31:16.952 --> 01:31:18.921
Thank you so much. This is lovely.

01:31:19.021 --> 01:31:21.657
I got a candy apple.
Where y'all went?

01:31:21.757 --> 01:31:24.497
Merry Christmas. How you doing?
Where y'all went?

01:31:25.761 --> 01:31:28.297
There they is, over there.
Hey, Oliver, how ya doin'?

01:31:28.397 --> 01:31:31.034
Good to see you. Good to
see you. All right, all right.

01:31:32.134 --> 01:31:35.977
Listen, listen, we have a contract.
You see those people over there?

01:31:36.638 --> 01:31:38.479
They are very powerful.

01:31:39.241 --> 01:31:41.710
You have to take down the nativity.

01:31:41.810 --> 01:31:43.389
Okay, that's it.

01:31:43.979 --> 01:31:46.415
May I have everyone's attention?

01:31:46.515 --> 01:31:47.816
What is she doing?

01:31:47.916 --> 01:31:49.551
Hello, Bucktussle.

01:31:49.651 --> 01:31:52.354
I want to thank you all for coming
out to the Christmas Jubilee.

01:31:52.454 --> 01:31:55.490
- Look at your daughter.
- Isn't she beautiful?

01:31:55.590 --> 01:31:57.559
I'd also like to thank Sheldon
Construction Company...

01:31:57.659 --> 01:32:00.171
for sponsoring this
Christmas celebration.

01:32:03.532 --> 01:32:07.269
Christmas is about giving back,
and with all the world watching...

01:32:07.369 --> 01:32:11.373
not only did Sheldon Construction
Company fund this event...

01:32:11.473 --> 01:32:13.442
but they've also agreed to release...

01:32:13.542 --> 01:32:18.148
150,000 gallons of water a day
down the river to the farmers.

01:32:19.648 --> 01:32:21.056
Thank you.

01:32:26.488 --> 01:32:29.068
- What are you doing?
- Giving goodwill towards men.

01:32:29.658 --> 01:32:32.094
- Thank you, Mr. Sheldon.
- She's smart.

01:32:32.194 --> 01:32:35.097
- I told you.
- Aren't you glad you didn't do anything?

01:32:35.197 --> 01:32:36.598
- You care about getting back...
- Yeah.

01:32:36.698 --> 01:32:38.867
To the heart of who we are as people.

01:32:38.967 --> 01:32:42.537
You are so proud to
be a part of a town...

01:32:42.637 --> 01:32:44.840
that doesn't mind keeping
the Christ in Christmas...

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:47.609
so much so, that they are
presenting the McCoy School...

01:32:47.709 --> 01:32:52.224
with $100,000 a year
for the next four years.

01:33:00.355 --> 01:33:02.591
- Yeah! Yes!
- Yes, yes!

01:33:02.691 --> 01:33:06.228
Such a fantastic Christmas
gift to the city, sir.

01:33:06.328 --> 01:33:09.231
- Can you give us a comment?
- So without further ado...

01:33:09.331 --> 01:33:11.433
let the Christmas Jubilee begin.

01:33:11.533 --> 01:33:13.112
Come on.

01:33:16.405 --> 01:33:20.476
Well, hello, Bucktussle,
and welcome...

01:33:21.243 --> 01:33:23.949
welcome to the Christmas
Jubilee and Fair.

01:33:24.746 --> 01:33:26.648
The children of McCoy School...

01:33:26.748 --> 01:33:29.518
have put together a little
presentation for us all...

01:33:29.618 --> 01:33:32.421
and this has all been under the
direction of their current teacher...

01:33:32.521 --> 01:33:34.489
May be wrong for that.

01:33:34.589 --> 01:33:36.558
I am so proud of the kids.

01:33:36.658 --> 01:33:38.093
Mrs. Lacey Williams.

01:33:38.193 --> 01:33:41.163
- Did she say, "Mrs. Lacey Williams"?
- It was all her idea.

01:33:41.263 --> 01:33:44.833
- Yep, she did.
- So, thank you, Lacey, for everything.

01:33:44.933 --> 01:33:50.646
And now the children of McCoy School,
featuring Bailey McCoy.

01:33:52.374 --> 01:33:54.253
That's my boy!

01:33:56.878 --> 01:34:01.216
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

01:34:01.316 --> 01:34:04.820
<i>That your baby boy</i>

01:34:04.920 --> 01:34:09.291
<i>Would give sight to the blind man?</i>

01:34:09.391 --> 01:34:13.662
<i>Mary, did you know</i>

01:34:13.762 --> 01:34:16.498
- <i>That your baby boy</i>
- Hey, baby.

01:34:16.598 --> 01:34:18.066
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:34:18.166 --> 01:34:22.738
<i>Would calm a storm with his hand?</i>

01:34:22.838 --> 01:34:25.741
<i>Did you know</i>

01:34:25.841 --> 01:34:29.378
<i>That your baby boy</i>

01:34:29.478 --> 01:34:34.850
<i>Has walked where angels trod</i>

01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:40.989
<i>And when you kiss your little baby</i>

01:34:41.089 --> 01:34:46.762
<i>You have kissed the face of God?</i>

01:34:46.862 --> 01:34:51.069
<i>Mary, did you</i>

01:34:51.733 --> 01:34:56.304
<i>Know?</i>

01:35:22.831 --> 01:35:24.900
You don't need to
have no lingerie on.

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.937
Eileen, tell him we've been shopping
at Tifton's for over 15 years.

01:35:29.037 --> 01:35:31.206
Yes, okay. I'm gonna help her.

01:35:31.306 --> 01:35:33.041
Okay, go help her. Fifteen years.

01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:35.677
Well, 15 years ago maybe
that lingerie worked.

01:35:35.777 --> 01:35:37.612
But now the lingerie
don't work, honey.

01:35:37.712 --> 01:35:39.181
You are so insulting!

01:35:39.281 --> 01:35:41.249
I am not insulting.
I am telling you the truth.

01:35:41.349 --> 01:35:42.984
You shouldn't have
on no damn lingerie.

01:35:43.084 --> 01:35:44.786
I'm trying to save you
some embarrassment.

01:35:44.886 --> 01:35:47.622
Put on that damn lingerie, look like
you got hair damage on your ass.

01:35:47.722 --> 01:35:51.827
I mean, come on now. Come on, honey.
I'm trying to help y'all.

01:35:51.927 --> 01:35:54.429
- Is this good?
- There you go trying to control everything.

01:35:54.529 --> 01:35:56.731
- I am not trying to...
- Let me get the lines clean.

01:35:56.831 --> 01:35:58.300
Let me get the eye lines clean...

01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:00.635
'cause I got a single on
me and a single on you.

01:36:00.735 --> 01:36:02.704
And Maysie's sitting in the
editing room right now cussing...

01:36:02.804 --> 01:36:04.439
'cause we're talking
all over each other.

01:36:04.539 --> 01:36:07.042
Lacey, you do not
have a Christmas tree!

01:36:07.142 --> 01:36:09.110
- Mama.
- What? No, really!

01:36:09.210 --> 01:36:10.679
That's why you wanted me here...

01:36:10.779 --> 01:36:13.315
- Yup, that's exactly why.
- I'll clean up and straighten out.

01:36:13.415 --> 01:36:15.851
I'm gonna take this room.
Let me go straighten up a little.

01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:17.853
- Then we'll go...
- She talks so much.

01:36:17.953 --> 01:36:20.522
- Is this one yours, Madea?
- All right, come on.

01:36:20.622 --> 01:36:22.702
What you talking about?
You just talking all over everybody.

01:36:26.728 --> 01:36:29.331
- Hi.
- Look, they do it in unison.

01:36:29.431 --> 01:36:32.300
They all do it in unison.
That's nice. Unison is nice.

01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:34.769
The unison is very nice.

01:36:34.869 --> 01:36:36.905
You tryin' to correct me?
I say it's "u-nis-on."

01:36:37.005 --> 01:36:38.507
No, Aunt Madea.

01:36:38.607 --> 01:36:40.342
So I have a meeting down the hall...

01:36:40.442 --> 01:36:43.011
Any unison when they sang unison.

01:36:43.111 --> 01:36:46.681
No, ma'am, it's not.
But that's fine. That's okay.

01:36:46.781 --> 01:36:48.416
I have a meeting down the hall...

01:36:48.516 --> 01:36:50.652
I thought it was "unison",
and "a cappollo."

01:36:50.752 --> 01:36:53.221
When they sang in no music,
what is that?

01:36:53.321 --> 01:36:54.456
No music?

01:36:54.556 --> 01:36:56.858
Yeah, when you sang and there ain't
no music, ain't that a "cappollo"?

01:36:56.958 --> 01:36:58.693
No, that's a cappella.

01:36:58.793 --> 01:37:00.695
I don't know much about music.

01:37:00.795 --> 01:37:03.307
Me and Ike Turner didn't make it.
He went on with Tina.

01:37:04.232 --> 01:37:06.134
That's okay. That's okay.

01:37:06.234 --> 01:37:07.969
I would beat the hell out of him.

01:37:08.069 --> 01:37:10.205
Ike wasn't gonna put his hands
on me. That's all I'm saying.

01:37:10.305 --> 01:37:12.073
I'm sorry. Say what you're
saying to the children.

01:37:12.173 --> 01:37:13.575
- Are you done? Okay.
- Yes!

01:37:13.675 --> 01:37:15.577
I have a meeting down the hall...

01:37:15.677 --> 01:37:17.846
You ain't getting testy with me, are you?
Talkin' about "Are you done?"

01:37:17.946 --> 01:37:20.215
- No, of course not.
- Okay.

01:37:20.315 --> 01:37:23.752
Let's start over from the top, 'cause
that's gonna make it in the gag reel.

01:37:23.852 --> 01:37:24.819
Speed.

01:37:24.919 --> 01:37:26.388
- White lightning?
- Yeah, moonshine.

01:37:26.488 --> 01:37:28.390
You want to take a snort?

01:37:28.490 --> 01:37:29.791
Nope, I'll pass.

01:37:29.891 --> 01:37:32.694
Boy, it'll put some hair on
your chest, I'll guarantee ya.

01:37:32.794 --> 01:37:36.398
Stop it. Come on.
Talk about hair on your chest.

01:37:36.498 --> 01:37:38.400
I could French-braid his.

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:40.435
That's right. I could
put a little bow on it.

01:37:40.535 --> 01:37:43.572
She's too pretty to have
hair on her chest. Really.

01:37:43.672 --> 01:37:45.674
I gotta tell you, I got rid of mine.

01:37:45.774 --> 01:37:47.742
Little bat hairs
attached to needles...

01:37:47.842 --> 01:37:50.011
soaked in cucumber juice
and a boatload of Nair.

01:37:50.111 --> 01:37:52.113
Gone, like that, if you
ever have a problem with...

01:37:52.213 --> 01:37:54.683
I've seen a mosquito
so daggone big...

01:37:54.783 --> 01:37:57.419
it was dry-humping a wiener
dog right there on the porch.

01:37:57.519 --> 01:38:01.089
She's way prettier than the
last one. She looked like...

01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:02.597
Tyler Perry.

01:38:05.694 --> 01:38:07.495
Boy, I tell you what, Son,
she's way prettier...

01:38:07.595 --> 01:38:09.497
than that last girl you was with.

01:38:09.597 --> 01:38:11.608
Good night. She looked
like old Tyler Perry.

01:38:14.703 --> 01:38:16.605
All right. Keep going.

01:38:16.705 --> 01:38:18.206
Oh, my God.

01:38:18.306 --> 01:38:20.041
Where are my manners?

01:38:20.141 --> 01:38:21.710
I'll do one it one more time. Ready?

01:38:21.810 --> 01:38:23.311
Where are my manners?

01:38:23.411 --> 01:38:25.380
But this'un,
you done good on this'un.

01:38:25.480 --> 01:38:27.816
Shut the...

01:38:27.916 --> 01:38:31.086
I need to introduce myself,
but where are my manners?

01:38:31.186 --> 01:38:32.788
I am...

01:38:35.290 --> 01:38:36.925
- All right.
- It's okay, Mama.

01:38:37.025 --> 01:38:39.401
I know. It's gonna roll at the
end of the movie. All right.

01:38:40.061 --> 01:38:42.197
I'm a truck driver.

01:38:42.297 --> 01:38:45.567
Been out on the road a lot.
Long-haul truck driver.

01:38:45.667 --> 01:38:46.968
You run long hos?

01:38:47.068 --> 01:38:48.336
No, long haul.

01:38:48.436 --> 01:38:50.038
Oh, haw, like haw.

01:38:50.138 --> 01:38:51.606
- Hauling.
- Oh, hauling.

01:38:51.706 --> 01:38:54.909
Like your eucalyptus.
Menthol. "Hall." Haul.

01:38:55.009 --> 01:38:56.311
Not "hole." Haul.

01:38:56.411 --> 01:38:58.780
- A hole, a haul, okay.
- But anyway...

01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:00.789
he still lives here, that Tanner.

01:39:02.250 --> 01:39:03.818
Kid's still beating him up?

01:39:03.918 --> 01:39:05.387
Yeah, he's still beating him up.

01:39:05.487 --> 01:39:07.555
The little kid?
He's too big for that.

01:39:07.655 --> 01:39:09.924
No, he's big now.
He's a regular-sized kid.

01:39:10.024 --> 01:39:12.594
I mean, he growed with...
He growed with Conner.

01:39:12.694 --> 01:39:15.730
Tanner, he's regular size.
He ain't like a dwarf or nothin'.

01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:17.866
- He growed?
- Yeah, he growed up that tall.

01:39:17.966 --> 01:39:20.635
He ain't a dwarf. I mean,
shoot, he'd take a dwarf.

01:39:20.735 --> 01:39:22.370
He'd kick ass out of a dwarf.

01:39:22.470 --> 01:39:23.938
Hell, I hope so.

01:39:24.038 --> 01:39:26.574
It's just regular-sized
kids he got trouble with.

01:39:26.674 --> 01:39:29.711
- Okay. Okay.
- But he's good in the dwarf department.

01:39:29.811 --> 01:39:32.480
I need a dictionary to keep
up with you sometime, honey.

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:36.317
If you're gonna do it, then you
need to do it and keep doin' her...

01:39:36.417 --> 01:39:39.554
and then when you're done doin' her,
you keep doin' her again...

01:39:39.654 --> 01:39:42.023
'cause you wanna keep doin'
what it is you need to do...

01:39:42.123 --> 01:39:44.464
in order to do what
you need to be doin'.

01:39:45.393 --> 01:39:46.665
Ain't that right?

01:39:47.562 --> 01:39:49.197
She told you that lie too?

01:39:49.297 --> 01:39:51.666
She didn't have no damn heart attack.

01:39:51.766 --> 01:39:55.036
She had gas. We got her to the hospital,
they said she had gas.

01:39:55.136 --> 01:39:56.104
What?

01:39:56.204 --> 01:39:59.649
They ran one of them pipes in there,
she farted, it was over.

01:40:05.346 --> 01:40:07.282
Yeah, she had gas.

01:40:07.382 --> 01:40:09.884
She had gas. She had gas.

01:40:09.984 --> 01:40:12.954
They hit her in the stomach real
hard and she farted. It was over.

01:40:13.054 --> 01:40:14.556
Then she had heartburn.

01:40:14.656 --> 01:40:17.566
Sounds like she needs
some Prilosec OTC.

01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.328
Get out my way!

01:40:20.428 --> 01:40:22.731
I don't need to be here
in this stuck-up-ass...

01:40:22.831 --> 01:40:24.299
bougie-ass store nowhere.

01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:27.309
I don't need to be up in
there with y'all! Go to hell!

01:40:30.905 --> 01:40:33.713
Where's my damn car?
Where's my damn car?

01:40:35.176 --> 01:40:36.687
Shut the hell up.

01:40:43.585 --> 01:40:44.720
Cut.
