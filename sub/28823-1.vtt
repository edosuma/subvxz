  that we are also a business

08:07.087 --> 08:09.821
   that needs to make money.

08:09.857 --> 08:10.822
          Fair enough.

08:10.858 --> 08:11.890
             Look.

08:11.925 --> 08:12.891
       What do you think?

08:12.926 --> 08:14.960
     I sold six of these on
     the website last week.

08:14.995 --> 08:15.994
              Oh.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.064
           I like it.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.932
      But what do t-shirts
    from our shop have to do

08:20.968 --> 08:22.734
with a lifestyle brand website.

08:22.769 --> 08:23.735
     It's a stepping stone.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.571
     First I sell t-shirts,
     then I sell cosmetics,

08:26.607 --> 08:29.140
  and then I sell a whole line
        of accessories.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.308
              Ah.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.010
   The website just features
  style and fashion right now

08:32.044 --> 08:35.080
         but eventually
      we're gonna move to

08:35.115 --> 08:36.982
   wellness, food and travel.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.183
   At least that's the plan.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.619
   Yeah, well I wouldn't bet
 against you, that's for sure.

08:40.654 --> 08:44.089
       [phone vibrating]

08:48.495 --> 08:50.295
             Scott?

08:50.330 --> 08:51.630
      This is incredible.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.031
       What's incredible?

08:53.066 --> 08:54.833
     You know that TV show
 about weddings that's filming

08:54.868 --> 08:57.369
    over the next two weeks,
       Wedding Countdown?

08:57.404 --> 08:58.403
            [gasps]

08:58.438 --> 08:59.304
              No.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.039
       Diana just saw on
      a social media blast

09:01.074 --> 09:03.742
  that they are looking for a
third engaged couple to compete.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.378
     Diana the dog groomer
          with the...

09:06.413 --> 09:08.446
       No, Diana, my old
        college roommate

09:08.482 --> 09:09.681
   who lives in Los Angeles.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.616
She'd be wearing those t-shirts
  with all the holes in them?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.986
    She created the website
            with me?

09:15.022 --> 09:16.555
         Ah, yes, yes.

09:16.590 --> 09:19.424
  That would make more sense.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.660
 But what does that have to do
            with us?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.162
             No. I-

09:24.197 --> 09:25.430
          Just listen.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.165
 I know what you're gonna say,
 but they would give us $15,000

09:27.200 --> 09:28.366
      to plan our wedding.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.234
        Absolutely not.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.470
    And if we win they would
        give us $50,000.

09:32.506 --> 09:34.105
    We've only been engaged
    for like a couple weeks,

09:34.141 --> 09:35.507
         and you wanted
       a long engagement

09:35.542 --> 09:37.042
    so you'd have more time
          to plan it.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.109
          You said so.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.345
     That's true, but think
   of everything we could do

09:40.380 --> 09:41.846
        with that money.

09:41.882 --> 09:43.315
   You know how I feel about
        shows like this.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.650
      They're the downfall
        to civilization.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.918
             Scott.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.553
            I can't.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.421
            Come on.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.056
   It would only be two weeks
           of filming

09:51.091 --> 09:54.326
    and this could be a huge
       difference for us.

09:54.361 --> 09:57.228
  And Diana said it'd be great
   promotion for our website,

09:57.264 --> 09:59.898
and it would definitely bring in
  more business for the store.

09:59.933 --> 10:04.569
 I mean, these TV shows pull in
 like a million viewers a week.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.904
        Diana said, huh?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.005
            Mmmhmm.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.942
   Well, I guess we could use
   $50,000 for a down payment

10:10.978 --> 10:12.510
          on a house.

10:12.546 --> 10:13.778
          Absolutely.

10:13.814 --> 10:17.682
And it could also pay for a few
 extended trips to Los Angeles.

10:21.121 --> 10:22.621
         You know what?

10:22.656 --> 10:23.555
             Sure.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.289

10:24.324 --> 10:25.490
          Let's do it.
            Why not?

10:25.525 --> 10:27.425
     Thank you! Thank you!
           Thank you!

10:27.461 --> 10:29.094
            Aaaaah.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.929
   You will not regret this.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.163
           I promise.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.264
              Ok.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.135
       It's really good,
      we're almost there,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.638
  but I would love if we could
 hold the two shot of the bride

10:39.673 --> 10:42.307
   and the groom just gazing
     into each other's eyes

10:42.342 --> 10:43.708
    for as long as possible.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.110
Their entire life just changed.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.580
   I really want the audience
         to feel that.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.483
         Good morning.

10:51.518 --> 10:53.351
    Uh-oh. I know that look.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.886
 That's either really good news
      or really bad news.

10:54.921 --> 10:57.122
     It's really good news.

11:04.965 --> 11:05.830
              Oh.

11:07.601 --> 11:08.933
        Brynn Matthews.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.068
    And where's the fiancé?

11:10.103 --> 11:12.771
 Uh, we're getting some photos
     of him this afternoon.

11:12.806 --> 11:13.938
        Are they local?

11:13.974 --> 11:16.341
   Yeah. He runs a beautiful
         antique store

11:16.376 --> 11:17.442
  about five blocks from here

11:17.477 --> 11:20.412
  and she just started her own
    lifestyle brand website.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.280
     (Lily) Well, she looks
        great on camera.

11:22.315 --> 11:23.515
 I'm assuming that he does too

11:23.550 --> 11:24.883
        but we're gonna
      have to see a photo.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.285
  Otherwise, really good find.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.353
         Thanks, boss.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.654
      What else do we know
           about him?

11:29.690 --> 11:30.922
The future bride's an open book.

11:30.957 --> 11:35.360
She's all over social media due
to said lifestyle brand website

11:35.395 --> 11:37.696
   but the groom is a bit of
       a different story.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.864
  That's rare, and refreshing.

11:39.900 --> 11:40.932
            Mmmhmm.

11:40.967 --> 11:41.866
 They don't exactly sound like
       the perfect match

11:41.902 --> 11:44.469
   but maybe that'll work out
         in our favour.

11:44.504 --> 11:45.737
      We'll find out more
       when we meet them

11:45.772 --> 11:46.905
 at their pre-interview today.

11:46.940 --> 11:48.606
     Alright, sounds good.
           Good job.

11:48.642 --> 11:49.708
            Thanks.

11:50.944 --> 11:54.179
 So I guess you could say Danny
 and I met totally by accident.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.346
            [laughs]

11:55.382 --> 11:56.281
       He was supposed to
       be meeting someone

11:56.316 --> 11:58.750
   on a blind date for coffee
         and so was I,

11:58.785 --> 12:00.085
      and we both mistook
           each other

12:00.120 --> 12:01.986
     for the people we were
       supposed to meet.

12:02.022 --> 12:04.589
   By the time our real dates
    arrived it was too late.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.957
 We were hooked on each other.

12:05.992 --> 12:06.858
            [laughs]

12:06.893 --> 12:10.595
   And the rest, as they say,
          is history.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.896
        That's perfect.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.364
     Why don't you tell me
       a little bit more

12:13.400 --> 12:15.433
   about what type of wedding
      you've got planned?

12:15.469 --> 12:17.168
      We're going for more
         of a handmade,

12:17.204 --> 12:18.536
     eco-friendly wedding.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.604
 I even made our wedding rings

12:19.639 --> 12:21.439
       out of repurposed
        steel and wood.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.141
Except for the engagement ring,
           of course.

12:23.176 --> 12:24.743
 No, that was my grandmother's.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.845
 And I made my own wedding gown
        out of material

12:26.880 --> 12:30.381
  from a local antique store,
   and I asked my bridesmaids

12:30.417 --> 12:32.150
      to just wear a dress
       they already own.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.718
    I mean, why not, right?

12:33.754 --> 12:36.621
 Who says we can't get married
   and help save the planet?

12:36.656 --> 12:37.789
              Ok.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.224
  Alright, well that's enough
            for now.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.592
         That's a cut!

12:40.627 --> 12:41.793
    That was great, you two.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.794
       Thank you so much.

12:42.829 --> 12:43.728
             Great.

             -Lily?
             -Yeah.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.365
  The third couple us running
         a little late

12:47.400 --> 12:49.000
        but they should
         be here soon.

12:49.035 --> 12:50.068
   Alright, I think we're ok
            on time.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.737
    Everyone take five until
   the next couple gets here!

         Lily. Nicole.

12:56.877 --> 12:58.409
     Sorry about cancelling
        the other night.

12:58.445 --> 12:59.644
 How are things going up there?

12:59.679 --> 13:00.612
       Yeah, we're good.

13:00.647 --> 13:01.813
          We're good.

13:01.848 --> 13:03.414
 We're up and running and we've
   got three terrific couples

13:03.450 --> 13:04.549
     for the next episode.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.518
       That's great news.

13:06.553 --> 13:09.988
I gotta say, you may be the only
  show currently in production

13:10.023 --> 13:11.890
       that I don't have
        to worry about.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.625
 Oh, that's nice of you to say.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.425
        Thanks, Nicole.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.460
     Well, it's the truth.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.995
  And I'm making sure everyone

13:17.030 --> 13:18.596
    over here at the network
           knows it.

13:18.632 --> 13:19.297
              Wow.

13:19.332 --> 13:20.665
 Wow. I don't know what to say.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.800
You don't have to say anything.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.102
Just promise me you'll continue
    to keep all of the drama

13:24.137 --> 13:26.638
     in front of the camera
       and not behind it.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.673
  Nicole, my reputation speaks
          for itself.

13:28.708 --> 13:30.608
       The shoot will run
        like clockwork.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.176
           Trust me.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.844
    Well, that's great news.

      Listen, I gotta go.

      I'd like you to meet
        our third bride.

    This is Brynn Matthews.

           -Down boy.

              Hi.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.664
      Wow, he's friendly.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.532
    He never takes to people
          this easily.

13:54.568 --> 13:55.166
              Aww.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.401
   How long have you had him?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.636
    Actually, Ollie belongs
         to my fiancé.

13:58.672 --> 13:59.838
   Wait a minute, did you say
            "Ollie"?

13:59.873 --> 14:00.805
            Mmm-Hmm.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.974
    Sorry, I had to close up
      the shop, am I late?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.843
       This is my fiancé,
         Scott Meyers.

14:04.878 --> 14:08.680
Scott, this is um... I'm sorry,
 I didn't quite get your name.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.315
             Lily.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.050

14:12.085 --> 14:15.286
Lily is the executive producer,
          so be nice.

14:15.322 --> 14:17.488
         That's great.

14:17.524 --> 14:18.456
            Hi Lily.

14:18.491 --> 14:20.124
              Hey.

14:20.160 --> 14:21.526
  Can I talk to you for a sec?

14:21.561 --> 14:22.727
          In private?

14:22.762 --> 14:23.628
           Uh, sure.

14:23.663 --> 14:24.562
       What's uh, wrong?

14:24.598 --> 14:27.265
          Um, just uh,
         give us a sec.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.833
             Babe.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.403
    It looks like somebody's
       getting cold feet.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.404
              Mmm?

14:33.440 --> 14:35.173
     Maybe this wasn't what
    he thought it would be.

14:35.208 --> 14:38.409
   No, it's um... it's worse
           than that.

14:38.445 --> 14:40.612
       What do you mean?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.448
    That's my ex-boyfriend.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.120
        [clears throat]

14:49.155 --> 14:51.389
  Look, all I'm saying is that
 maybe the timing isn't right.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.525
  I mean, we threw this whole
 thing together in such a rush.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.328
    Should we just hold off
   and throw a proper wedding

14:57.364 --> 14:59.297
    like we always planned?

14:59.332 --> 15:01.366
Wait, why the sudden reluctance?

15:01.401 --> 15:03.534
 You agreed to be part of this
      with me, didn't you?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.602
          I did, but-

15:04.638 --> 15:05.870
           But what?

15:05.906 --> 15:08.806
 I cannot believe that you and
groom number three used to date.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.541
   I mean, what are the odds?

15:10.577 --> 15:11.576
        Was it serious?

15:11.611 --> 15:13.544
       How long were you
         guys together?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.546
        Tandy, I promise
    I'll tell you everything

15:15.582 --> 15:16.748
    but all you need to know
           right now

15:16.783 --> 15:19.984
 is that it was a clean break,
   not gonna affect the show.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.653
     Ok, well are you sure?

15:21.688 --> 15:22.854
   'Cause that didn't exactly
           look like

15:22.889 --> 15:25.924
      the warmest reunion
        I've ever seen.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.161
            Ok. Ok.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.829
      I'll go talk to him,
   make sure everything's ok.

15:31.865 --> 15:33.264
   (2nd AD) Tandy, go to two.

15:33.300 --> 15:34.098
         Go for Tandy.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.200
      Lily is needed back
         at base camp.

15:36.236 --> 15:38.202
        Something to do
      with night permits.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.504
           Copy that.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.139
  They need you back at base.

15:41.174 --> 15:44.642
      You go, I will talk
         to those two.

15:44.678 --> 15:46.110
         Thanks, Tandy.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.514
   Ok, there's something you
probably should know before we-

15:49.549 --> 15:50.815
          Sorry, guys.

15:50.850 --> 15:51.916
       Is everything ok?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.785
  I'm so sorry, we're holding
    everybody up, aren't we?

15:53.820 --> 15:54.719
        No, not at all.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.120
   It's just we're on a super
         tight schedule

15:56.156 --> 15:57.121
   and we wanna get started.

15:57.157 --> 15:58.656
     Of course, I'm ready.

15:58.692 --> 16:01.092
      It's gonna be fine.
           Trust me.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.727
              Hmm?

16:02.762 --> 16:03.461
              Ok.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.029
        Great, come on.

16:17.344 --> 16:19.043
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.913
     I heard the interviews
           went well.

16:21.948 --> 16:22.814
           Um, yeah.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.883
       Yeah, I guess so.

16:25.919 --> 16:28.753
 (Both) Listen, I had no idea-

16:28.788 --> 16:29.454
       Ok, you go ahead.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.189
         You go ahead.
          I was gonna-

16:31.224 --> 16:34.525
           [laughing]

16:34.561 --> 16:36.494
  This is a little too awkward.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.397
    Yeah, tell me about it.

16:39.432 --> 16:43.534
   I'm assuming, from Brynn's
       reaction that um,

16:43.570 --> 16:46.637
 you haven't told her about us.

16:46.673 --> 16:47.572
          Not exactly.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.974
    She knows I had someone
       in my life but uh,

16:50.010 --> 16:51.876
 there was never any real need
     to go into any detail

16:51.911 --> 16:53.478
      about you until now,
           of course.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.245
          Right. Yeah.

16:54.280 --> 16:55.313
      Totally understand.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.147
             Yeah.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.482
      Uh, that being said,

16:57.517 --> 17:00.151
 I think you're probably gonna
       have to tell her.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.719
    Oh yeah, I was about to.

17:01.755 --> 17:04.422
  But then we got sidetracked
       with all of this.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.223
             Right.

17:05.258 --> 17:06.156
             Yeah.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.625

17:07.660 --> 17:09.127
           [laughing]

17:09.162 --> 17:09.961
              Aww.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.061
    I can't believe he still
          remembers me

17:11.097 --> 17:12.230
      after all this time.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.097
             What?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.198
      Are you kidding me?

17:14.233 --> 17:16.000
 I once played an old video of
      one of our old trips

17:16.036 --> 17:18.669
      and he flipped when
      he heard your voice.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.737
              Aww.

17:19.772 --> 17:24.041
  I mean, I was... cleaning up
      through the closet.

17:24.077 --> 17:26.109
     It kinda rolled out...
          It kinda...

17:26.146 --> 17:27.444
       I didn't even know
         if it'd work.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.746
           I get it.

17:28.782 --> 17:30.314
       Which trip was it?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.985
           Yosemite.

17:34.020 --> 17:35.253
     That was a great week.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.120
             Right?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.622
   I can't believe we climbed
           Half Dome.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.157
             Yeah.

17:41.661 --> 17:43.561
           Um, yeah.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.730
    I better... I gotta get
          to my desk.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.765
     Yeah, Brynn's probably
 just done with make-up, so...

17:47.801 --> 17:48.566
            Mmmhmm.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.167

        you again, Lily.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.735
         Yeah, you too.
            You too.

17:50.770 --> 17:54.138
       And I'm glad you-
    you found someone and...

17:54.174 --> 17:54.806
            Thanks.

17:54.841 --> 17:55.907
             Yeah.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.342
         Smooth, Lily.

18:01.381 --> 18:04.015
               ♪

18:04.050 --> 18:07.285
 So how long do you need me to
  pretend that nothing went on

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
     between you and groom
         number three?

18:09.355 --> 18:11.889
    Just a ballpark figure.

18:11.925 --> 18:14.592
    There's really not much
            to tell.

18:14.627 --> 18:19.564
  We met here, in college, we
started dating our freshman year

18:19.599 --> 18:21.799
     and after we graduated
      we moved to New York

18:21.835 --> 18:24.302
    so I could become a very
       successful writer.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.103
              Oh.

18:25.138 --> 18:26.137
        Scott got a job
       as a photographer

18:26.172 --> 18:27.438
      at an auction house.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.506
              Oh.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.508
    Sounds like the perfect
   little love story so far.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.276
      So what went wrong?

18:32.312 --> 18:35.079
      The promise of fame
          and fortune.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.181
  A talent agent read a short
     story that I happened

18:37.217 --> 18:40.318
to get published and next thing
   you know I get a job offer

18:40.353 --> 18:44.422
   as a staff writer on this
   new one-hour drama series.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.524
         Only catch is
        it's shot in LA.

18:46.559 --> 18:47.825
       Wow, good for you.

18:47.861 --> 18:50.061
    He was in the middle of
     a big project at work

18:50.096 --> 18:51.929
       so we both decided
       that it'd be best

18:51.965 --> 18:54.132
       if he just stayed
          in New York

18:54.167 --> 18:56.334
     and came out if things
       worked out for me.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.468
       That makes sense.

18:57.504 --> 18:58.336
             Yeah.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.971
        Except the show
    barely lasted one season

19:00.006 --> 19:01.139
    before it was cancelled.

19:01.174 --> 19:02.273
              Oh.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.208
   So what, did you move back
   to New York after, or...?

19:04.244 --> 19:05.042
            Uh, no.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.277
       I got another job.

19:06.312 --> 19:07.211
          Kept going.

19:07.247 --> 19:08.713
       So we tried to do
    the long distance thing

19:08.748 --> 19:10.348
         but, you know,
     that didn't work out.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.618
   Until fate brought you two
         back together.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.119
    I don't believe in fate.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.221
     The past is the past.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.523
   What does that even mean?

19:18.558 --> 19:20.057
         Well, it means
      he's getting married

19:20.093 --> 19:23.094
      and I'm here to make
        a show about it.

 You're not even dating anyone,
        Tandy, are you?

19:52.659 --> 19:56.360
Seriously, you've never thought
about trying on wedding dresses?

19:56.396 --> 19:59.530
   Almost, once in New York.

19:59.566 --> 20:01.866
             Spill.

20:01.901 --> 20:05.770
 I was walking with... someone
     in the Upper East Side

20:05.805 --> 20:08.339
 and we passed this magnificent
        bridal boutique

20:08.374 --> 20:10.942
    that had a long display
  of beautiful wedding dresses

20:10.977 --> 20:14.579
  behind the glass and the way
  the light hit the window it-

20:14.614 --> 20:16.314
it looked like I was wearing one

20:16.349 --> 20:19.217
  so we were just being silly
   going from dress to dress

20:19.252 --> 20:21.686

       in the reflection.

20:22.789 --> 20:23.888

Until Scott said that we should
     go inside and pretend

20:25.291 --> 20:27.658
      that we were engaged
     so I could actually...

20:30.029 --> 20:32.730
    anyway, that was a long
           time ago.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.398

         we're getting

20:52.619 --> 20:54.485
     is of Brynn picking up
      her wedding favours.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.953
   That's right, she ordered
          them online.

20:55.989 --> 20:56.954
             Yeah.

20:56.990 --> 20:59.257

       to get his tuxedo.

20:59.292 --> 21:03.194
      Well, why don't you
       ask him yourself?

21:05.832 --> 21:07.999
   Maybe I should say hello?

21:08.034 --> 21:09.834
    Do you need a chaperone?

21:09.869 --> 21:11.569
            Beat it.

21:14.507 --> 21:16.907

   Oh, did you by any chance
    talk to Brynn about us?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.549
I tried, but she's been so busy
        with the website

21:25.585 --> 21:26.517
    and the wedding details

21:26.552 --> 21:28.152
  I haven't been able to find
        the right time.

21:28.187 --> 21:29.820
   I'm sure it's no big deal,

21:29.856 --> 21:32.189
    I just don't want her to
  pull out at the last minute

21:32.225 --> 21:34.458
       because you waited
      a while to tell her.

21:34.494 --> 21:36.927
Trust me, Lily, there is nothing
     that's gonna stop her

21:36.963 --> 21:38.362
    from being on your show.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.664
            Nothing.

21:39.699 --> 21:40.931
              Ok.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.400
          I trust you.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.335
        Well, thank you.

21:44.370 --> 21:45.436
      Oh, I almost forgot.

21:45.471 --> 21:48.039
  In an hour we're gonna shoot
    Brynn at the post office

21:48.074 --> 21:50.174
picking up her wedding favours.

21:50.209 --> 21:51.776
    Could you do me a favour
      and drive her there?

21:51.811 --> 21:54.211
  It would be really great to
 capture both of you on screen

21:54.247 --> 21:56.013
        as she opens it
      for the first time.

21:56.049 --> 21:57.248
          Yeah, sure.
          No problem.

21:57.283 --> 22:00.418
 I was just heading to the park
  to finish this roll of film.

22:00.453 --> 22:01.886
          Wanna join?

22:01.921 --> 22:03.621
             Yeah.

22:03.656 --> 22:06.090
  So I've been wondering what
  happened with your first job

22:06.125 --> 22:06.991
          in New York.

22:07.026 --> 22:07.992
         Oh, you know.

22:08.027 --> 22:08.826
         Typical stuff.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.027
          Downsizing.

22:10.063 --> 22:11.495
       The prospect of me
       trying to make it

22:11.531 --> 22:13.264
  as a freelance photographer
          in that city

22:13.299 --> 22:15.199
   didn't really appeal to me
           very much.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.134
     But you, know what, a
     funny thing happened.

22:17.170 --> 22:21.272
 After taking so many photos of
 antiques for the auction house

22:21.307 --> 22:25.576
  I actually developed a real
      passion for history.

22:25.611 --> 22:28.679
    So I came back here and-
      hold this for a sec-

22:28.715 --> 22:33.651
     found a place to rent
     and my shop was born.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.486
         Good for you.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.754
             It is.

22:36.789 --> 22:39.190
 Although, truth be told, Brynn
has recently expressed a desire

22:39.225 --> 22:41.325
      to move back to your
       neck of the woods.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.294
  Diana, her business partner,
      lives in Los Angeles

22:43.329 --> 22:46.497
     and keeps telling her
   that LA's the place to be.

22:46.532 --> 22:48.999
   Is that what you wanna do?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.668
          Not really.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.636
        I like it here.

22:52.672 --> 22:56.073
         But you know,
    nothing's in stone yet.

22:56.109 --> 22:57.308
  Enough about me and my life.

22:57.343 --> 22:58.609
        What about you?

22:58.644 --> 22:59.744
    Why'd you stop writing?

22:59.779 --> 23:01.912
       Don't tell me you
    gave it up indefinitely.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.047
            Sort of.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.016
    As you probably know we
sometimes have to add storylines

23:06.052 --> 23:07.284
   to the shows that I make.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.053
    There's not a whole lot
           of reality

23:09.088 --> 23:10.888
   in reality TV these days,

23:10.923 --> 23:14.058
   so that helps fill some of
    the void that was there

23:14.093 --> 23:16.060
     when I stopped writing
       fictional stories.

23:16.095 --> 23:18.696
 Looks like we both got thrown
  down some unexpected paths,

23:18.731 --> 23:20.398
           didn't we?

23:20.433 --> 23:21.265
             Yeah.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.167
   Yeah, but you know, it's-
           it's good,

23:23.202 --> 23:26.771
    I have a job that I like
     and it pays the bills.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.472
       It could be worse.

23:28.508 --> 23:33.511
  Well, last shot here but...
         you know what?

23:33.546 --> 23:35.780
 I think I could use your help.

23:35.815 --> 23:37.248
   No. Scott, come on, don't.

23:37.283 --> 23:38.382
        I look terrible.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.650
           Excuse me?

23:39.685 --> 23:41.552
 Am I not helping you out with
 a scene for your reality show

23:41.587 --> 23:44.054
 in like... less than an hour?

23:44.090 --> 23:45.456
         Uh, not fair.

23:45.491 --> 23:49.427
 The least you could do is pose
    for one photo, come on.

23:49.462 --> 23:55.366
     The lighting is great
    and you look beautiful.

23:55.401 --> 23:59.570
       So let me just...
       wait, one second.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.739
          Up a touch.

24:10.716 --> 24:13.217
           Hey, guys!

24:13.252 --> 24:15.119
  I have been looking for you.

24:15.154 --> 24:16.120
              Hey.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.087
              'Sup?

24:17.123 --> 24:18.355
     Tandy said she needed
      Scott and me to take

24:18.391 --> 24:21.525
 some publicity photos before I
go pick up the wedding favours.

24:21.561 --> 24:22.493
    (Scott) More like "we".

24:22.528 --> 24:24.295
Looks like I'm driving you now.

24:24.330 --> 24:25.162
              Oh.

24:25.198 --> 24:26.130
Lily thought it'd be a good idea

24:26.165 --> 24:28.199
  to help improve the emotion
         on the camera.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.201
       Lily, great idea.

24:30.236 --> 24:31.735
     I'm glad you like it.

24:31.771 --> 24:33.003
    Well, I should get back
          to base camp

24:33.039 --> 24:36.207
 and you guys might wanna head
 over to the photo shoot soon.

24:36.242 --> 24:37.308
             Yeah.

24:37.343 --> 24:38.275
          Oh, thanks.

24:38.311 --> 24:39.510
            See ya.

24:39.545 --> 24:40.344
           Hi, honey.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.545
      What's up, sweetie?

24:41.581 --> 24:42.780
    (Brynn) Oh, I like this.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.148
         You like that?

24:44.183 --> 24:44.648
    (Brynn) You look great.

24:44.684 --> 24:45.583
       (Scott) Thank you.

24:45.618 --> 24:46.584
     (Brynn) I love this...

24:52.225 --> 24:56.026
     [door bells jingling]

24:56.062 --> 24:56.961
              Hey.

24:57.530 --> 24:58.896
              Hey.

24:58.931 --> 24:59.997
       Are those for me?

25:00.032 --> 25:02.299
  Actually, these are for us.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.602
I stopped by the florist on the
 way back from the bridal shop

25:04.637 --> 25:08.005
 and I chose these three types
  of flowers for you to choose

25:08.040 --> 25:09.473
     for our centrepieces.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.375
    Ok, so what am I looking
            at here?

25:11.410 --> 25:13.911
         Purple irises,
       yellow ranunculus,

25:13.946 --> 25:16.780
      and the very exotic
       Lily of the Incas.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.715
              Huh.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.750
       Based on the space
    and the colour we chose

25:19.785 --> 25:23.254
    for the reception I like
        the ranunculus.

25:23.289 --> 25:24.255
       What do you think?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.190
     I agree. Yellow it is.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.291
             Cool.

25:33.766 --> 25:37.768
Hey, so remember when I told you
  about a serious relationship

25:37.803 --> 25:40.004
    I had before you, right?

25:40.039 --> 25:41.572
             Yeah.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.274
        What about her?

25:43.309 --> 25:44.942
     Well, you're not gonna
          believe this

25:44.977 --> 25:47.111
    but she's actually back
            in town.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.513
  At least for a little while.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.714
            Really?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.283
             Yeah.

25:52.318 --> 25:54.618
     Have you seen her yet?

25:54.654 --> 25:55.786
            I have.

25:55.821 --> 25:59.490
     In fact, we both have.

25:59.525 --> 26:02.293
       What do you mean?
  You're not making any sense.

26:02.328 --> 26:07.164
         [laughs] Well,
  you're not gonna believe...

26:07.199 --> 26:14.171
     so actually, um, my ex
    is the TV show producer.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.974
      Um, Lily Bellenger.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.583
            [sighs]

26:32.158 --> 26:33.324
       So, I mean, yeah.

26:33.359 --> 26:35.259
   You'll be there on the day
 to deal with this, so will I.

26:35.294 --> 26:37.328
   But I just wanna make sure
     that everyone's aware

26:37.363 --> 26:40.731
  that we have backup wardrobe
options for the family members-

26:40.766 --> 26:41.865
             Tandy?

26:41.901 --> 26:44.234
    Would you mind the store
 while I find some place quiet

26:44.270 --> 26:45.803
     to work on the budget?

26:45.838 --> 26:46.670
             Sure.

26:46.706 --> 26:47.805
   I'll text you if anything
           comes up.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.373
           Thank you.

26:51.210 --> 26:56.880
               ♪

27:47.333 --> 27:48.432
     Oh, excuse me, ma'am?

27:48.467 --> 27:49.867
 You dropped your credit card.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.702
              Oh!

27:51.737 --> 27:53.303
      Professor Townsend?

27:53.339 --> 27:54.304
             Lily!

27:54.340 --> 27:58.242
    Oh, I can't believe it!

27:58.277 --> 27:59.977
            It's me.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.746
   Oh, my dear, I'm in shock.

28:02.782 --> 28:03.747
          Look at you!

28:03.783 --> 28:04.648
       At your old table.

28:04.684 --> 28:06.950
 I remember you just like this.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.419
 It's been a while, hasn't it?

28:08.454 --> 28:10.854
       It certainly has.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.157
Do you remember that short story
         that you wrote

28:13.192 --> 28:14.391
    during your senior year?

28:14.427 --> 28:18.529
 I still use that as an example
  for my first year students.

28:18.564 --> 28:19.763
       I actually heard.

28:19.799 --> 28:22.332
One of your students that works
  at the coffee shop told me.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.101
      I am very flattered.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.170
     So what are you up to
          these days?

28:26.205 --> 28:29.206
       Writing the great
    American novel, I hope.

28:29.241 --> 28:31.875
Well, life took me in a slightly
      different direction.

28:31.911 --> 28:33.110
              Mmm.

28:33.145 --> 28:34.011
          It happens.

28:34.046 --> 28:35.579
    As long as you're happy.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.581
        I am. Thank you.

28:37.616 --> 28:38.849
             Good.

28:38.884 --> 28:41.218
 Well, if you'll excuse me I'm
 actually late for a class but-

28:41.253 --> 28:44.188
       oh, it's wonderful
    to see you again, Lily.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.123
   Let's try to stay in touch
           this time.

28:46.158 --> 28:47.124
           I promise.

28:47.159 --> 28:50.561
 And think about writing again.

28:50.596 --> 28:53.697
    You owe it to yourself.

29:22.695 --> 29:26.697
     Well, Brynn definitely
   gets points for going big.

29:26.732 --> 29:28.432
      I'll give her that.

29:28.467 --> 29:31.034
       Go big or go home.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.637
   You really think Nicole's
       gonna go for this?

29:33.672 --> 29:35.272
   It- it may be a production
           challenge

29:35.307 --> 29:39.109
   but the results are gonna
        be spectacular.

29:39.145 --> 29:40.744
   We've never done anything
       like this before,

29:40.780 --> 29:42.279
      not by a long shot.

29:42.314 --> 29:44.681
       Tell me about it.

29:44.717 --> 29:46.750
      I did go for a hike
         this morning.

29:46.786 --> 29:49.286
       I imagined myself
      out on Walden Pond.

29:49.321 --> 29:53.657
    It used to help me clear
   my head, inspire writing.

29:53.692 --> 29:58.295
 Weird, I haven't thought about
      that in a long time.

29:58.330 --> 30:01.031
    Sounds like you miss it.

30:01.066 --> 30:02.900
 I don't have time to miss it,
         with our prep,

30:02.935 --> 30:05.269
  production, planning, post.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.337
     There's only 24 hours
           in a day.

30:07.373 --> 30:11.508
 Well, somehow you always seem
          to find 25.

30:11.544 --> 30:12.776
         Back to work.

30:12.812 --> 30:14.678
     This location is tough

30:14.713 --> 30:19.316
 but we won't let this mountain
      get the best of us.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.450
              No.

30:27.626 --> 30:29.126
    This is gonna be great.

30:29.161 --> 30:31.495
Ok, so I think we should set up
    two cameras on the altar

30:31.530 --> 30:34.531
 so we can capture the ceremony
          and then um,

30:34.567 --> 30:36.166

So, this is what you do all day,
    ordering people around.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.912
  I don't like to think of it
     as ordering anything,

30:48.948 --> 30:51.315
       I consider it just
      making suggestions.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.382
              Ah.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.084

  but it looks like my fiancé

30:54.119 --> 30:56.987
     is making suggestions
           to Tandy.

30:57.022 --> 30:57.921

      can handle herself.

31:04.196 --> 31:07.598

     I told Brynn about us.

31:07.633 --> 31:08.832
             Good.

31:08.868 --> 31:09.633
             Good.

31:09.668 --> 31:10.667
         Yeah, how did-
       how did she react?

31:10.703 --> 31:12.469
  Surprised, to say the least,
       but she was fine.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.171
   You know, to her the past
          is the past.

        I'm seeing you.

  invited Lily to the wedding.

 the TV show I told you about?

       of that happening?

       Can I talk to you?

32:02.288 --> 32:03.620
         I just wanted
        to let you know

32:03.656 --> 32:06.256

          between us.

        had good taste.

   That's- that's really nice
     of you to say, Brynn.

  We can go to that new place,
          Chez Louis.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.085
       It's very trendy.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.320

   Don't listen to him, Lily.

    I was thinking of doing

      my daughter-in-law.

32:49.501 --> 32:50.901

        positive energy.

    come to my best friend's

   and getting us some food.

38:16.895 --> 38:19.629
    That sounds interesting.

38:19.665 --> 38:23.433
      Head cheese terrine.

38:23.468 --> 38:24.834
              Hmm.

38:24.870 --> 38:28.038
        Not your average
        Pineville fare.

38:28.073 --> 38:30.674
     Beef cheek stroganoff.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.908
              Ok.

38:31.943 --> 38:35.278
        [French accent]
 Yes, madam, for today we have
           our juicy

38:35.314 --> 38:37.914
  rat cheek extraordinaire...

38:37.949 --> 38:40.483
    When you put your fork,
       in it, it will...

38:40.519 --> 38:43.119
             Sorry.

38:43.155 --> 38:44.120
              Shh.

38:44.156 --> 38:47.524
           [laughing]

38:47.559 --> 38:50.894
     Is Uncle Links's Pizza
    still around the corner?

38:50.929 --> 38:52.462
         Come on, now.

38:52.497 --> 38:54.364
       You read my mind.

38:54.399 --> 38:55.932
          Let's do it.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.375
             -Mmm.
             -Mmm.

39:05.410 --> 39:07.344
         It's so good.

39:07.379 --> 39:09.279
        Even better than
          I remember.

39:09.314 --> 39:10.347
         You know what?

39:10.382 --> 39:13.049
    It almost tastes as good
   as the pizza in New York.

39:13.085 --> 39:13.683
              Mmm.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.785
   Hey, I said "almost", ok?

39:15.821 --> 39:17.854
            [laughs]

39:17.889 --> 39:21.758
   So I gotta say, I'm really
impressed the way you and Brynn

39:21.793 --> 39:27.263
    are just kinda throwing
  this whole wedding together.

39:27.299 --> 39:28.665
   What're you talking about?

39:28.700 --> 39:30.233
      Isn't that the basis
      of your whole show?

39:30.268 --> 39:35.972
Yes, but never with anyone that
  I know or dated for so long.

39:36.007 --> 39:37.307
          Fair enough.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.909
     You guys, you met here
      in Pineville, right?

39:39.945 --> 39:42.212
     Yep. She grew up here.

39:42.247 --> 39:43.880
  After the antique store was
   up and running I realized

39:43.915 --> 39:46.282
  I needed help with marketing
 so some other business owners

39:46.318 --> 39:49.319
      recommended her and
      the rest is history.

39:49.354 --> 39:51.388
        That's so sweet.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.995
   They look so much younger
    than we did at that age,

39:59.030 --> 39:59.963
          don't they?

39:59.998 --> 40:01.264
      Speak for yourself.

40:01.299 --> 40:02.732
     I haven't aged a bit.

40:02.768 --> 40:03.500
            [laughs]

40:03.535 --> 40:04.868
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.003
     I'm a big TV star now,
     you better be careful.

40:07.038 --> 40:07.837
            Not yet.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.306
   I can always edit you out.

40:10.342 --> 40:11.408
          Good point.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.143
            [laughs]

40:14.446 --> 40:18.348
  I uh, really messed that up,
           didn't I?

40:18.383 --> 40:20.183
  I didn't handle it so well.

40:20.218 --> 40:22.385
          Handle what?

40:22.421 --> 40:24.921
         The break up.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.423
    I... kinda took the easy
            way out.

40:26.458 --> 40:28.291
          Oh, come on.
        Would you stop?

40:28.326 --> 40:29.492
      That was years ago.

40:29.528 --> 40:30.960
        You don't owe me
       any explanations.

40:30.996 --> 40:32.462
        I know. I know.

40:32.497 --> 40:33.797
   I just have been thinking
          about a lot

40:33.832 --> 40:34.998
     since I saw you again.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.667
   Please tell me you're not
about to get all serious on me.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.169
           [laughing]

40:39.204 --> 40:40.370
      I'm not, I promise.

40:40.405 --> 40:43.706
   I just- I want you to know
 that when I got to Los Angeles

40:43.742 --> 40:49.078
      all I could focus on
         was my career.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.114
           I'm sorry.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.315
           I get it.

40:52.350 --> 40:56.286
When that scripted series ended
   I took the reality TV job

40:56.321 --> 40:59.055
'cause I just didn't wanna look
         like a failure

40:59.090 --> 41:02.592
 and go back home with my tail
        between my legs.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.660
             Yeah.

41:03.695 --> 41:07.864
   Well, you should be sorry
    'cause you did mess up.

41:07.899 --> 41:09.432
      I mean, look at me.

41:09.468 --> 41:11.468
  I'm one of the hottest guys
         in Pineville.

41:11.503 --> 41:12.569
            [laughs]

41:12.604 --> 41:13.903
        Would you stop?

41:13.939 --> 41:15.238
            [laughs]

41:15.273 --> 41:16.706
  I was trying to be serious.

41:16.741 --> 41:17.841
            Ok, ok.

41:17.876 --> 41:20.577
      I know, I'm... I was
         just kidding.

41:20.612 --> 41:24.214
     You know, when it gets
  too serious I crack a joke.

41:24.249 --> 41:27.484
      How could I forget?

41:27.519 --> 41:30.119
    Well, I'm not gonna lie.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.055
     It wasn't easy losing
         you back then.

41:32.090 --> 41:33.857
  And yeah, it took me a while
        to get over you

41:33.892 --> 41:36.059
and finally find somebody else.

41:36.094 --> 41:38.561
     What're you gonna do?

41:38.597 --> 41:41.231
 Our timing just wasn't right.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.035
             Yeah.

42:01.052 --> 42:02.252
        [message alert]

42:02.287 --> 42:06.856
  That's um, that's Tandy just
 letting me know my call time.

42:06.892 --> 42:08.658
    Yeah, we should probably
        call it a night.

42:08.693 --> 42:09.559
             Yeah.

42:09.594 --> 42:10.827
      You want me to walk
       you to your hotel?

42:10.862 --> 42:11.761
         No, that's ok.

42:11.796 --> 42:13.496
 It's just a block and a half.
           Thank you.

42:13.532 --> 42:16.065
   And thanks for a wonderful
            evening.

42:16.101 --> 42:17.934
     Well, you're welcome.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.569
           Goodnight.

42:19.604 --> 42:21.471
           Goodnight.

42:25.944 --> 42:29.946
               ♪

42:29.981 --> 42:31.748
      Just the two of you?

42:31.783 --> 42:33.449
          Interesting.

42:33.485 --> 42:34.150
             What?

42:34.185 --> 42:35.184
       Would you stop it?

42:35.220 --> 42:36.486
       Nothing happened.

42:36.521 --> 42:39.022
       Yeah, thankfully.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.957
    I knew I shouldn't have
           told you.

42:40.992 --> 42:41.791
         Come on, Lily.

42:41.826 --> 42:43.259
    By the way you described
          the evening

42:43.295 --> 42:45.128
    it sounds like there was
     something in the air.

42:45.163 --> 42:48.932
    Tandy, it was completely
      innocent, trust me.

42:48.967 --> 42:52.535
Innocent or not, it sounds like
       a date in my book.

42:52.571 --> 42:54.103
    Remind me never to read
           your book.

42:54.139 --> 42:56.439
    Can't you at least admit
     there's a possibility

42:56.474 --> 42:57.774
     there's still a spark?

42:57.809 --> 43:00.877
   Scott is getting married,
    as he absolutely should.

43:00.912 --> 43:05.181
 And I would never do anything
    to jeopardize that, ok?

43:05.216 --> 43:07.817
Not to mention I would never do
anything to jeopardize the show

43:07.852 --> 43:11.421
 because if I did I could kiss
       my career goodbye.

43:11.456 --> 43:13.990
      Well, that is true.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.192
    And seeing as my career
      is linked to yours,

43:16.227 --> 43:18.861
 maybe we should just stay away
    from Scott from now on.

43:18.897 --> 43:19.996
              Ok?

43:22.934 --> 43:24.434
       What do you think?

43:24.469 --> 43:26.903
  I think you probably should
   have cancelled the dinner

43:26.938 --> 43:28.838
        the moment Brynn
       and your mom did.

43:28.873 --> 43:31.608
  I was talking about the tux,
        Mr. Fancy Pants.

43:31.643 --> 43:33.910
      Besides, Brynn said
     she was cool with it.

43:33.945 --> 43:34.944
           Oh, Scott.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.145
    You're such an innocent.

43:36.181 --> 43:38.982
 She was probably just testing
   you to see what you'd do.

43:39.017 --> 43:40.049
           [chuckles]

43:40.085 --> 43:42.585
  You have been single for way
      too long, my friend.

43:42.621 --> 43:43.653
      Well, that's neither
        here nor there.

43:43.688 --> 43:46.623
   Look, there's a 50 percent
     chance that I'm wrong.

43:46.658 --> 43:49.392
   But if my math is correct

43:49.427 --> 43:53.730
  that means there's also a 50
 percent chance that I'm right.

43:53.765 --> 43:54.897
          Just sayin'.

43:54.933 --> 43:58.735
   What- Jeff, it was a slice
  of pizza with an old friend.

43:58.770 --> 44:01.170
    Yes, despite our history
      I still consider her

44:01.206 --> 44:03.873
      to be an old friend
      just like I do you.

44:03.908 --> 44:05.174
            Touché.

44:05.210 --> 44:07.744
  Look, for the record I know
       you've always been

44:07.779 --> 44:08.845
        a stand-up guy,

44:08.880 --> 44:10.613
  and I know you've always got
    the best of intentions.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.849
  I'm just trying to give you
          a heads up.

44:12.884 --> 44:17.286
 The situation you're in could
  get real sticky in a hurry.

44:17.322 --> 44:18.154
             Yeah.

44:18.189 --> 44:20.423
     Well, I appreciate it.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.259
   But I hope you have faith
    in me to know that I'm-

44:23.294 --> 44:26.029
 I'm the kind of guy who always
 ends up doing the right thing.

44:26.064 --> 44:26.996
           Of course.

44:27.032 --> 44:27.930
       Without question.

44:27.966 --> 44:29.899
     And whatever happens,
       I'll stand by you.

44:29.934 --> 44:30.733
         You know that.

44:30.769 --> 44:32.268
             Yeah.

44:32.303 --> 44:35.171
 But don't forget, I was around
  when Lily broke up with you

44:35.206 --> 44:39.108
      so you'll forgive me
    if I never wanna see you

44:39.144 --> 44:40.910
     go through that again.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.111
      You know, 50 percent
          of the time

44:42.147 --> 44:46.315
   I have no idea what you're
talking about, but the other 50?

44:46.351 --> 44:48.685
You actually start making sense,
          my good man.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.987
       You sound like one
         of my clients.

44:51.022 --> 44:52.255
              Wow.

44:52.290 --> 44:54.357
    This should be illegal.

44:54.392 --> 44:57.493
      The name is Beckman.
         Jeff Beckman.

44:57.529 --> 44:59.696
            [laughs]

44:59.731 --> 45:00.563
             Right?

45:00.598 --> 45:01.564
     Someone had to do it.

45:01.599 --> 45:03.032
   (Both) I guess it's gonna
       be me every time.

45:03.068 --> 45:04.434
          -Basically.
          -Every time.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.601
     Is this the right tux?

45:07.072 --> 45:09.539
This is our Italian cream cake.

45:09.574 --> 45:12.408
  Almond coconut with a lovely
      mascarpone frosting.

45:12.444 --> 45:13.876
 It's one of our best sellers.

45:13.912 --> 45:14.944
          Interesting.

45:14.979 --> 45:15.611
              Ok.

45:15.647 --> 45:16.679
  What do you think, Patricia?

45:16.715 --> 45:20.083
 Delicious. I like this a lot.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.621
 This is our ginger spice cake.

45:25.657 --> 45:27.356
Also one of our most requested.

45:27.392 --> 45:28.291
              Mmm.

45:29.561 --> 45:31.060
I think I like this one better.

45:31.096 --> 45:32.495
 The flavours are more intense.

45:32.530 --> 45:33.529
            Mmmhmm.

45:33.565 --> 45:35.998
         Mmm, mmm, mmm.

45:36.034 --> 45:39.235
        I want it to be
      absolutely perfect.

45:39.270 --> 45:40.636
     What else do you have?

45:40.672 --> 45:42.739
 I think I have just the thing.

45:42.774 --> 45:44.607
      [door bells jingle]

45:44.642 --> 45:45.675
              Hey.

45:45.710 --> 45:47.243
 Sorry I'm late, I got held up
       trying on my tux.

45:47.278 --> 45:48.377
    How's the tasting going?

45:48.413 --> 45:52.682
        It's uh, going.

45:52.717 --> 45:53.716
        That good, huh?

45:53.752 --> 45:56.452
   Let's just say it has been
      a work in progress.

45:56.488 --> 45:57.420
              Hmm.

45:57.455 --> 45:58.254
          Here we are.

45:58.289 --> 45:59.122
    This is our newest cake.

45:59.157 --> 46:02.792
         Pink champagne
     with raspberry mousse.

46:03.895 --> 46:05.027
              Mmm.

46:05.063 --> 46:06.763
              Mmm.

46:06.798 --> 46:08.831
       This is delicious.

46:08.867 --> 46:09.766
           I love it.

46:09.801 --> 46:10.666
            I agree.

46:10.702 --> 46:12.468
     This is a sure winner.

  see what my followers think.

  subscribers that follow her

46:30.488 --> 46:32.255
  on the website she has, mom.

46:32.290 --> 46:34.757
  You have like, what, 25,000
     followers now, Brynn?

46:34.793 --> 46:38.161
   Actually, it just reached
       30,000 this week.

46:38.196 --> 46:39.428
              Oh.

46:39.464 --> 46:42.565
 When we get to over 100,000 or
 more then they start paying us

46:42.600 --> 46:45.134
   to post for various brands
         and products.

46:45.170 --> 46:47.203
     This has all gone way
         over my head.

46:47.238 --> 46:48.004
      But what do I know?

46:48.039 --> 46:50.206
      I can't even program
          my cable TV.

46:50.241 --> 46:54.443
   In any case, I still think
 that last cake was fantastic,

46:54.479 --> 46:57.947

    opinion is still worth.

  I'm just a little stressed,
          that's all.

47:15.767 --> 47:17.633
     I mean, I need a cake
 that's gonna have a wow factor

47:17.669 --> 47:20.670
       for when I post it
        to the website.

47:20.705 --> 47:23.005
 Even if it doesn't taste good?

47:23.041 --> 47:26.008
   Scott, there are gonna be
     a million or so people

47:26.044 --> 47:28.311
     that watch our episode
    of the Wedding Countdown

47:28.346 --> 47:30.680
 and that's when a lot of them
        are gonna decide

47:30.715 --> 47:32.548
      whether or not they
        follow me online

47:32.584 --> 47:34.684
 and subscribe to the website.

47:34.719 --> 47:37.286
   But part of that decision
  is based on if they identify

47:37.322 --> 47:40.690
  with me and like the choices
    I make during the show.

47:40.725 --> 47:43.125
Since they can't taste the cake

47:43.161 --> 47:46.295
 their decision is based solely
  on what the cake looks like.

47:46.331 --> 47:47.330
             Yeah.

47:47.365 --> 47:48.564
           I get it.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.499
 But I decided to be a part of
  this with the understanding

47:50.535 --> 47:52.635
     that the show would be
     a part of our wedding,

47:52.670 --> 47:54.804
   not the other way around.

47:54.839 --> 47:57.039
     It's not my goal to be
       a reality TV star.

           with you.

            on this

  you with your antique store.

48:12.790 --> 48:14.757

     the back six episodes

50:02.266 --> 50:04.133
 for a full season commitment.

50:04.168 --> 50:05.801

50:05.837 --> 50:08.437

     that's fantastic news.

 We're also going to make a big
   announcement in the press

   it under wraps until then.

     a shoulder to cry on,

01:00:31.662 --> 01:00:34.529
    a date for the movies, a

01:00:34.565 --> 01:00:36.632
   a person to laugh with you
       when you're happy

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:39.334
 and someone to always kiss you
          in the rain.

   Yeah, if there was one bit
     of advice I would give

 A little bit more passionate.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:03.458
  Not exactly my strong suit,
          as you know.

01:01:03.494 --> 01:01:04.726

         dreamed about

01:01:13.470 --> 01:01:17.639

   powerful right at the end.

Something like um, "every moment
       that I look at you

       your own version.

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.041
             Right.

01:01:53.077 --> 01:01:54.076
            Uh-huh.

01:01:54.111 --> 01:01:55.343
  Thanks for your help, Lily.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:56.645
    I really appreciate it.

01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.779
           Any time.

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:00.982
      [door bells jingle]

01:02:03.554 --> 01:02:06.521
           Holy moly.

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:08.023
          Look at you!

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:10.292
   I leave you alone for like
         a couple hours

01:02:10.327 --> 01:02:11.760
   and you end up filling up
           the place?

01:02:11.795 --> 01:02:13.795
   I'd love to tell you I had
    anything to do with this

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:16.732
  but almost everyone here has
  been asking if this is where

01:02:16.767 --> 01:02:19.801
 the wedding show is shooting.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:20.869
 Seems like word's getting out,

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.871
   but I don't know if people
    are here to buy antiques

01:02:22.906 --> 01:02:24.940
     or show up on camera.

01:02:24.975 --> 01:02:27.075
   Well, I'm kinda surprised
     you're even open today

01:02:27.111 --> 01:02:31.113
    with just 24 hours to go
      before the wedding.

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:32.147
         Yeah, well, to
      tell you the truth,

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:34.216
   the TV show wedding staff
      did most of the work

01:02:34.251 --> 01:02:38.920
prepping for the wedding and uh,
  Brynn took care of the rest

01:02:38.956 --> 01:02:42.591
   so there wasn't a lot left
   for me to do but show up.

01:02:42.626 --> 01:02:45.994
 Oh, and thanks for letting me
     work on my vows, mom.

01:02:46.029 --> 01:02:48.063
     And with that, my work
         is done here,

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:50.065
     and I'm off to pick up
           my dress.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.568
       Well, travel safe.

01:02:53.604 --> 01:02:54.870
       I love you, dear.

01:02:54.905 --> 01:02:57.372
     I love you, too, mama.

01:03:03.313 --> 01:03:05.514
        How's it looking
         for you, boss?

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:06.782
           It's good.

01:03:06.817 --> 01:03:09.818
 I want at least one camera to
 stay on Brynn the entire time.

01:03:09.853 --> 01:03:12.387
     Alright, that's a wrap
         on rehearsal!

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.389
    See you at the wedding!

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.793
       That was terrific.

01:03:17.828 --> 01:03:18.493
        That was great.

01:03:18.529 --> 01:03:19.394
I'm so excited for the wedding.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.730
   I promise to send you out
          with style.

01:03:21.765 --> 01:03:22.931
         Thanks, Lily.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.065
   You know, I have to admit,

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:26.868
you actually look like you know
    what you're doing here.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:27.803
         I'm impressed.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:28.904
         Thanks, Jeff.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.972
 I think there was a compliment
      in there somewhere.

01:03:31.008 --> 01:03:33.175
        You're welcome.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:34.743
How was the run-through for you?

01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.778
   Yeah, it felt pretty good.

01:03:36.814 --> 01:03:38.013
         Everything ok?

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:38.880
            Mmmhmm.

01:03:38.916 --> 01:03:42.784
     Yeah, just uh, so much
        going on, so...

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.486
     You know what, before
       everyone scatters,

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:46.755
   Scott, would you guys mind
   heading over to wardrobe?

01:03:46.790 --> 01:03:48.890
     I think they made some
  adjustments to your tuxedo.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.826
 Just wanna make sure they fit.

01:03:50.861 --> 01:03:52.527
      Yeah, sounds great.
         See you later?

01:03:52.563 --> 01:03:53.628
             Yeah.

01:03:56.099 --> 01:03:57.833
       Maybe I'm reading
       into this too much

01:03:57.868 --> 01:04:00.335
but is something bothering you?

01:04:00.370 --> 01:04:01.436
            Me? No.

01:04:01.471 --> 01:04:04.372
     No, I'm fine, really.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.575
  Alright. You can talk to me
        if you need to.

01:04:06.610 --> 01:04:07.676
          It's my job.

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:08.677
           Thank you.

01:04:08.712 --> 01:04:09.878
       I appreciate that.

01:04:09.913 --> 01:04:12.948
 You're picking up your wedding
   dress later today, right?

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:14.449
             Yeah.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:17.152
     Do you- do you want me
         to tag along?

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.588
       Extra set of eyes?

01:04:19.623 --> 01:04:21.890

            I agree.

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.272
      That was hard work.

01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:18.873
            [laughs]

01:06:18.909 --> 01:06:20.308
         I needed that.

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:21.509
     I feel like I've been
          in work mode

01:06:21.545 --> 01:06:23.511
    for two months straight
         on this show.

01:06:23.547 --> 01:06:24.546
          I envy you.

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.949
      You have a career in
   Los Angeles that you love.

01:06:27.985 --> 01:06:29.818
    I don't know about love.

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:30.919
            It's ok.

01:06:30.954 --> 01:06:34.889
  I guess the question for me
    now is what to do next.

01:06:34.925 --> 01:06:36.558
       What do you mean?

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.427
 Well, I think I'm on the verge
of a major deal with the network

01:06:39.463 --> 01:06:42.464
   that airs this show, which
   would inevitably tie me up

01:06:42.499 --> 01:06:45.734
for the next two to three years
       making reality TV.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:47.736
  Am I missing something here?

01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:49.471
 I'm waiting for the bad news.

01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:52.340
Ever since I got back into town
  after being away for so long

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:55.010
  this old passion that I had
          for writing

01:06:55.045 --> 01:06:56.745
  has just come flooding back.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:07:00.181
  Well, that's good, isn't it?

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:01.850
         I don't know.

01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:03.118
           We'll see.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:03.952
        Enough about me.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:05.153
         How about you?

01:07:05.188 --> 01:07:09.090
      Do you- do you wanna
      talk about anything?

01:07:09.126 --> 01:07:13.495
    I think Scott and I are
    just starting to realize

01:07:13.530 --> 01:07:17.465
  that the differences we used
      to find so charming

01:07:17.501 --> 01:07:19.134
 are starting to cause problems

01:07:19.169 --> 01:07:20.902
       the closer we get
        to the wedding.

01:07:20.937 --> 01:07:25.607
Oh, well that stuff always works
     itself out over time.

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:28.610
 It didn't with you and Scott.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:30.645
       You got me there.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:33.515
     I guess all I can say
        is that Scott is

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:36.785
   a good, honest, loyal guy
         who's gonna be

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:40.789
  a stable and calming partner
            for you.

01:07:40.824 --> 01:07:43.224
 But I'm the complete opposite.

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:44.559
         I love change.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:45.960
Anything exciting and different.

01:07:45.996 --> 01:07:49.964
      That's the problem.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.866
That stuff, it just takes time.

01:07:51.902 --> 01:07:54.369
  You guys will figure it out.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.571
         You think so?

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.006
              Yes.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.707
          I really do.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:01.076
     It's been a long day.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:02.577
      We should get out of
         these dresses

01:08:02.612 --> 01:08:04.245
and let everyone close up shop.

01:08:04.281 --> 01:08:05.847

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.402
        How's the ankle?

01:09:01.438 --> 01:09:02.237
           I'm fine.

01:09:02.272 --> 01:09:03.270
    Surgery is in two days.

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:04.606
   I didn't wake you, did I?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.406
              No.

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:06.640
        No, not at all.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.475
  I still have to go over the
seating plan for the reception.

01:09:08.511 --> 01:09:09.042
             Nice.

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.212
     But save your energy.

01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.046
           For what?

01:09:12.082 --> 01:09:13.715
    My wedding gift to you.

01:09:13.750 --> 01:09:15.283
    I just had a late dinner
        with the people

01:09:15.318 --> 01:09:17.519
     who run Trend Benders.

01:09:17.554 --> 01:09:18.386
   Wait, I've heard of them.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:21.022
They're a huge marketing agency,
             right?

01:09:21.057 --> 01:09:22.090
              Yep.

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:23.858
     They have taken quite
   an interest in our website

01:09:23.894 --> 01:09:27.127
and they want to discuss how we
can become part of their group.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:29.596
             What?

01:09:29.633 --> 01:09:30.598
        That's amazing.

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:33.734
 Brynn, I completely understand
         your situation

01:09:33.770 --> 01:09:35.837
        but this website
      is gaining traction

01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:39.006
  and I just can't keep doing
   these meetings by myself.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:41.242
            I know.

01:09:41.278 --> 01:09:42.644
      I just have to wait
       for the right time

01:09:42.679 --> 01:09:44.612
 to discuss things with Scott.

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:48.249
       His antique store
    means the world to him,

01:09:48.285 --> 01:09:51.051
   and he's really skeptical
 about the move to Los Angeles.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.555
       It's not gonna be
     an easy conversation.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.423
  Right now we're just trying
  to get through the last day

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.458
      before the wedding.

01:09:57.494 --> 01:09:59.327
              Ok.

01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.496
        Get some sleep.

01:10:01.531 --> 01:10:02.797
            Thanks.

01:10:02.832 --> 01:10:04.465
           Goodnight.

01:10:15.245 --> 01:10:17.278
        It's been a race
       against the clock,

01:10:17.314 --> 01:10:19.180
   but everything seems to be
 on time for Brynn and Scott's

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.715
   last minute dream wedding.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:24.185
 Can these two top our previous
     two fantastic weddings

01:10:24.221 --> 01:10:28.089
       and take home our
    grand prize of $50,000?

01:10:28.124 --> 01:10:30.592
      It's anyone's guess.

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:32.794
            And cut!

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.066
 This rain is ruining my hair.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:38.967
    Was that one ok for you?

01:10:39.002 --> 01:10:41.035
  You know Lily normally makes
           that call

01:10:41.071 --> 01:10:42.804
       but I have no idea
         where she is.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:45.340
           [thunder]

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:46.040
         You know what?

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:46.975
 Let's do one more for safety,

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.344
   maybe put more of a smile
        in it this time.

01:10:50.814 --> 01:10:51.913
             What?

01:10:51.948 --> 01:10:52.780
            Nothing.

01:10:52.816 --> 01:10:56.317
    That's exactly what Lily
        would have said.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:58.586
Tandy, the wedding couple wants
       to move to plan B.

01:10:58.622 --> 01:11:00.221
              Ok.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.322
 Guys, we're moving to plan B.

01:11:01.358 --> 01:11:04.592
    Wedding couple's decided
  to move the ceremony inside.

01:11:04.995 --> 01:11:07.595
    I'm have to say I think
      that's a good idea.

01:11:11.101 --> 01:11:12.166
             Lily!

01:11:12.202 --> 01:11:13.134
      You finally decided

01:11:13.169 --> 01:11:15.136
     to take my suggestion
      of sleeping in, huh?

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:16.137
      Everything in place?

01:11:16.172 --> 01:11:17.538
     Let's shoot this thing
    and get outta here, huh?

01:11:17.574 --> 01:11:19.173
     Uh, yeah. About that.

01:11:19.209 --> 01:11:22.977
      There's been a small
        change of plans.

01:11:23.013 --> 01:11:26.281
  Brynn, from this day forward
       I promise I'll...

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:31.953
           I'll be...

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:33.054
            If I...

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:49.437
   I thought the groom wasn't
   supposed to see the bride

01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.873
      before the wedding.

01:11:51.908 --> 01:11:54.309
    Just checking in on you.

01:11:54.344 --> 01:11:55.843
  No, I'm- I'm good, you know.

01:11:55.879 --> 01:12:00.181
    Just waiting to be told
          where to go.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:02.016
             Right.

01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:03.318
      Everything alright?

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:07.889
      Have you um... given
        any more thought

01:12:07.924 --> 01:12:12.193
    to the possibility of us
     moving to Los Angeles?

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:14.162
            I have.

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:15.763
              And?

01:12:15.799 --> 01:12:18.866
     And I'm not sure yet.

01:12:18.902 --> 01:12:20.601
     You know about my time
          in New York

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:22.870
     and why I had to come
       back to Pineville.

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:24.939
             I do.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:28.443
  But New York and Los Angeles
    are like night and day.

01:12:28.478 --> 01:12:32.714
   And look, we'd still be in
    sunny California, right?

01:12:32.749 --> 01:12:36.017
   It's only a couple hours'
           drive away

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:36.884
             Yeah.

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.386
Yeah, I hear what you're saying,
             Brynn,

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:42.357
 and I wanna support you, I do,
             but...

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:46.227
  but I just don't see myself
    moving from here again.

01:12:46.262 --> 01:12:48.296
    I mean, this is my home,
     where my business is,

01:12:48.331 --> 01:12:52.433
   and where I hope we start
        a life together.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.334
  But I'm beginning to realize

01:12:53.370 --> 01:12:56.604
      you have to be true
       to yourself, too.

01:12:56.639 --> 01:12:58.506
          We both do.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.675
     Even if that means...

01:13:05.081 --> 01:13:07.648
         You're right.

01:13:07.684 --> 01:13:11.886
   We can't force each other
    to be people we're not.

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:16.491
  You shouldn't sacrifice what
 you want and neither should I.

01:13:16.526 --> 01:13:20.561
      It wouldn't be fair
        to either of us.

01:13:20.597 --> 01:13:23.798
  In a way it's probably good
    this TV show came about.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:25.933
  I mean, it helped us realize
      how different we are

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:28.002
       from one another.

01:13:28.037 --> 01:13:31.706
      Yeah. I was thinking
        the same thing.

01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:39.981
  So I guess this is it then.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:42.483
            [sighs]

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:45.319
But I want you to know, though,

01:13:45.355 --> 01:13:47.088
   I will always care for you

01:13:47.123 --> 01:13:50.258
     and be rooting for you
       wherever you are.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.760
            I know.

01:13:52.796 --> 01:13:56.564
      You are a good man,
         Scott Meyers.

01:13:56.599 --> 01:14:00.268
        One of the best.

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.570
     You go get 'em in LA.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:03.571
            I will.

01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:05.940
           [chuckles]

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:11.012
    Hey, uh, everything ok?

01:14:11.047 --> 01:14:13.381
       Everyone's looking
      for you two and uh,

01:14:13.416 --> 01:14:15.983
  I've never looked this good
       in my entire life,

01:14:16.019 --> 01:14:19.787
   so come on, it's go time.

01:14:19.823 --> 01:14:22.757
             Yeah.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.459
             It is.

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:44.145
      What just happened?

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:46.614
        The inevitable.

01:14:46.649 --> 01:14:48.950
           [laughing]

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:53.754
        [crowd murmurs]

01:14:56.659 --> 01:15:00.228
     Does anybody have eyes
    on the bride and groom?

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.099
         I don't know.

01:15:06.469 --> 01:15:08.636
             Lily.

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:09.504
              Hi.

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:10.304
          How are you?

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:11.506
        Welcome to town.

01:15:11.541 --> 01:15:12.139
            Thanks.

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:13.007
   I thought I'd surprise you

01:15:13.042 --> 01:15:15.643
        with a crew from
    the local news station.

01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.211
         That's great.

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:18.312
              Hi.

01:15:22.118 --> 01:15:24.085
 So we've checked every trailer
   in base camp and the PA's

01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.521
are looking all over Main Street
    but no sign of them yet.

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:27.889
       Ok. Ok. Thank you.

01:15:27.924 --> 01:15:30.191
        Thanks. You can-
          you can go.

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:31.726
         Did I get here
         at a bad time?

01:15:31.761 --> 01:15:32.793
              No.

01:15:32.829 --> 01:15:33.628
        No, not at all.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.096
     We're just working out
          a few kinks.

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:36.497
      You know how it is.

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:39.066
 So, before the wedding starts

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:42.603
      I wanted to pass on
     some other good news.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:45.273
    The network has decided
    to give you an exclusive

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:48.809
        two year overall
        production deal.

01:15:51.414 --> 01:15:53.214
        That's amazing!

01:15:53.249 --> 01:15:54.315
            Amazing.

01:15:55.285 --> 01:15:57.552
 Is that all you're gonna say?

01:15:57.587 --> 01:16:02.056
 My friends, I'm afraid I have
     some unfortunate news.

01:16:05.028 --> 01:16:08.129
     Due to some unforeseen
         circumstances

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:10.197
      the wedding has been
          called off.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:13.634
        [crowd murmurs]

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:26.147
           [knocking]

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.315
           Tandy, hi.

01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:28.916
   Lily, where have you been?

01:16:28.952 --> 01:16:30.585
       I've been looking
       all over for you.

01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:34.388
    Oh, I've been right here
    not answering the phone.

01:16:34.424 --> 01:16:37.191
  Have you been up all night?

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:38.125
          Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:38.161 --> 01:16:41.562
       I've been working
     on this- this letter.

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.030
            To who?

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:47.602
   Nicole and to the network.

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:51.672
    It's my official letter
        of resignation.

01:16:51.708 --> 01:16:53.140
             What?

01:16:53.176 --> 01:16:54.041
        You're leaving?

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:55.509
             Lily!

01:16:55.545 --> 01:16:59.880
    I... I talked to Nicole
      about it last night.

01:16:59.916 --> 01:17:06.554
 I just- I told her I... I just
  don't have it in me anymore.

01:17:06.589 --> 01:17:09.690
 She didn't disagree after what
  happened last night on set.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.158
    You think she would have
      loved all that drama

01:17:11.194 --> 01:17:12.526
    in front of the camera.

01:17:12.562 --> 01:17:17.698
       It was my decision
       to leave the show.

01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:22.803
    Lily, are you sure this
       is what you want?

01:17:22.839 --> 01:17:25.206
     You've worked so hard
     to get to this point.

01:17:25.241 --> 01:17:27.575
     Yeah, but it was only
  after getting to this point

01:17:27.610 --> 01:17:31.612
    that I realized how far
    off course I really am.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:34.181
      I had my dream job.

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:36.050
     I hit one little bump
          in the road

01:17:36.085 --> 01:17:39.887
and I went and found the closest
    safety net that I could.

01:17:39.922 --> 01:17:41.455
   Don't- don't get me wrong.

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:44.959
I have been proud of every show
         I've produced.

01:17:44.994 --> 01:17:49.864
   But it's time to get back
           on track.

01:17:49.899 --> 01:17:52.833
     No more distractions.

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:56.937
   Well, you do seem to have
 that spark back in your eyes.

01:17:56.973 --> 01:17:59.807
    Yeah, I- I haven't felt
   like this in a long time,

01:17:59.842 --> 01:18:04.812
       so I think I made
        the right call.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:06.947
     Right now I just wanna
         clear my head

01:18:06.983 --> 01:18:10.918
and not worry about anything so
that I can focus on my writing.

01:18:10.953 --> 01:18:14.088
  Do you have enough put away
       to hold you over?

01:18:14.123 --> 01:18:14.989
             Yeah.

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.991
         I'll be fine.

01:18:17.026 --> 01:18:18.426
      That's good to hear.

01:18:18.461 --> 01:18:20.528
            Mmmhmm.

01:18:20.563 --> 01:18:22.630
 Have you heard from Scott yet?

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:25.533
            Not yet.

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.768
          Are you ok?

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:29.203
         I'll be fine.

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:32.673
  Don't worry about me, you've
  got bigger fish to fry now.

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.842
   What're you talking about?

01:18:34.877 --> 01:18:36.844
    If you don't have a job
         neither do I.

01:18:36.879 --> 01:18:38.913
         Which is fine.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:41.716
   Maybe I'll take that trip
        to Machu Picchu.

01:18:41.751 --> 01:18:43.417
I've always wanted to go there.

01:18:43.453 --> 01:18:44.652
       I don't know why.

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:47.755
    Tandy, you're not going
           anywhere.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:48.689
       What do you mean?

01:18:48.725 --> 01:18:50.391
You just said you were quitting.

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:52.460
     Well, I hate to steal
        Nicole's thunder

01:18:52.495 --> 01:18:57.398
      but congratulations,
    Miss Executive Producer.

01:18:57.433 --> 01:18:59.633
       Wedding Countdown
         is yours now.

01:19:00.670 --> 01:19:01.535
          Yeah right.

01:19:01.571 --> 01:19:02.903
  I talked to Nicole about it
           last night

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:04.905
  and she couldn't agree more.

01:19:04.941 --> 01:19:06.707
     You have earned this.

01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:09.110
      It's your time now.

01:19:12.215 --> 01:19:13.414
   I don't know what to say.

01:19:13.449 --> 01:19:15.449
      Don't say anything.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:17.518
      Just make me proud.

01:19:18.654 --> 01:19:20.488
            [laughs]

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.261
   Can I make one suggestion?

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:28.095
             Sure.

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:29.930
     You're in charge now.

01:19:29.966 --> 01:19:33.834
       When you're ready,
         talk to Scott.

01:19:35.838 --> 01:19:40.141
    It might take some time,
       but aye, aye, sir.

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:41.275
           [laughing]

01:19:55.024 --> 01:19:57.858
        [Ollie barking]

01:19:58.961 --> 01:20:00.628
     [door bells jingling]

01:20:00.663 --> 01:20:03.030
           Hi, Ollie.

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:03.898
           Hey, boy.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:05.032
       How're you doing?

01:20:10.406 --> 01:20:11.639
              Hey.

01:20:11.674 --> 01:20:14.241
       Long time no see.

01:20:14.277 --> 01:20:16.644
      Sorry, I didn't mean
          to intrude.

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:18.279
  I was hoping we could talk.

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.781
         Yeah, me too.

01:20:20.817 --> 01:20:22.650
 I know you had quite the mess
      to clean up at work.

01:20:22.685 --> 01:20:24.518
    Yeah, well it turns out
     you don't have to stay

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:27.988
  and clean up the mess if you
don't work on the show anymore.

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:31.358
   I was just in LA tying up
          loose ends.

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:32.893
              Oh.

01:20:32.929 --> 01:20:34.495
              Wow.

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:36.063
           I'm sorry.

01:20:36.098 --> 01:20:37.364
           It's fine.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:38.766
     I'm the one who left.

01:20:38.801 --> 01:20:39.834
        It was my call.

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:45.272
      Yeah, still though,
  it's... it's gotta be tough.

01:20:45.308 --> 01:20:51.078
      Not as tough as what
       you went through.

01:20:51.113 --> 01:20:54.014
     I'm really sorry about
         you and Brynn.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:55.716
     Yeah, well, you know,

01:20:55.751 --> 01:21:02.289
it was definitely the best thing
        for both of us.

01:21:02.325 --> 01:21:06.927
  It's good that you found out
      before the wedding.

01:21:06.963 --> 01:21:12.266
 Like, actually minutes before,
           but still.

01:21:12.301 --> 01:21:15.336
        Hey, you hungry?

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:17.438
       Wanna grab a bite?

01:21:17.473 --> 01:21:18.639
             Yeah.

01:21:18.674 --> 01:21:19.773
             Sure.

01:21:19.809 --> 01:21:21.675
          Ellen's ok?

01:21:21.711 --> 01:21:22.910
           Always is.

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:36.624
     We spent so much time
         at this table.

01:21:36.659 --> 01:21:38.125
         Oooh, did we?

01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.094
I still remember our first date.

01:21:40.129 --> 01:21:41.495
     I couldn't get a word
          in edgewise.

01:21:41.530 --> 01:21:42.463
            [laughs]

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:43.797
         That's right.

01:21:43.833 --> 01:21:45.065
             Yeah.

01:21:45.101 --> 01:21:46.967
I'm surprised you didn't run for
the hills right then and there.

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:47.735
            Oh, no.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:48.736
          I loved it.

01:21:48.771 --> 01:21:50.070
       I was so nervous.

01:21:50.106 --> 01:21:51.639
    I was just glad you did
        all the talking.

01:21:51.674 --> 01:21:53.707
   It was a wonderful night.

01:21:53.743 --> 01:21:57.144
         Yeah, it was.

01:22:00.049 --> 01:22:01.115
            Thanks.

    You never left me, Lily.

  These past couple of weeks,

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:40.821
    I've been thinking about
   doing some writing again.

 doing that here in Pineville?

01:22:45.995 --> 01:22:48.796
           A re-boot?
