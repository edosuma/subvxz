(mellow music playing)

01:04.166 --> 01:05.934
Sophia, what are you doing?

01:06.000 --> 01:08.133
Painting numbers on my toes.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.567
I keep forgetting their names.

01:11.967 --> 01:15.033
(sighs)
But Lucy will be here any minute.

01:15.100 --> 01:16.300
Honey, this doesn't look very nice.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.367
I say, let relatives see
how you really live.

01:18.433 --> 01:19.700
That way, they don't hang around.

01:21.133 --> 01:24.066
Well, it so happens
that my niece and I are very close.

01:24.133 --> 01:26.066
In fact, I'm hoping her interviews go well

01:26.133 --> 01:29.333
so she can transfer to a college here
and I can see her more often.

01:29.400 --> 01:32.567
I was never close with any of my nieces.
They all became nuns.

01:33.066 --> 01:34.967
It's hard to shop for a nun at Christmas.

01:35.967 --> 01:38.967
-Oh, my God, I can't believe it!
-What?

01:39.033 --> 01:40.567
-A rat!
-A rat?

01:40.633 --> 01:44.867
It wasn't a rat.
It was a cute little mouse.

01:44.934 --> 01:48.133
Rose, it doesn't wear white gloves
and work at Disneyland.

01:49.233 --> 01:51.300
We're talking about a rodent.

01:51.367 --> 01:52.767
Oh, I'm calling the exterminator.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.667
Oh, no, don't!

01:54.734 --> 01:56.834
A mouse saved my life once.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.533
His name was Larry.

02:01.367 --> 02:02.500
Larry the mouse.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.467
Oh, I loved Larry.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.867
He used to walk to school with me
every day

02:07.934 --> 02:10.066
on a little leash
I made out of kite string.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.867
Well, one day,
we were about to cross the bridge

02:13.934 --> 02:15.367
down near the schoolhouse,

02:15.433 --> 02:17.867
and Larry stopped dead in his tracks.

02:17.934 --> 02:21.300
No matter how I yanked on that leash,
he just wouldn't move.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.433
Suddenly, I heard this loud noise.

02:25.333 --> 02:28.100
The dam upstream had broken,

02:28.166 --> 02:31.633
and this rush of water
swept the bridge away.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.500
Larry saved my life!

02:36.033 --> 02:39.233
If it weren't for a mouse
just like that little one in the kitchen,

02:39.800 --> 02:43.600
I wouldn't be sitting here today
telling you this story.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.367
-Call the exterminator.
-Call the exterminator.

02:51.967 --> 02:52.734
(doorbell rings)

02:52.800 --> 02:54.967
Oh, my gosh, that must be Lucy.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.834
All right, now, you-all.
Please, no more rat talk.

03:00.300 --> 03:01.300
Ah, Lucy.

03:01.367 --> 03:02.433
-Hi!
-Aunt Blanche!

03:02.934 --> 03:04.867
Get in here.
I want you to meet my friends.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.767
This is Sophia and Dorothy and Rose.

03:06.834 --> 03:08.467
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you, Lucy.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.400
Let me get a look at you, girl.

03:10.467 --> 03:14.900
Mmm, terrific little figure,
gorgeous hair, perfect skin.

03:14.967 --> 03:16.567
Just like looking in a mirror.

03:18.066 --> 03:19.400
Get some Windex!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.967
How was your trip?

03:23.033 --> 03:24.734
Oh, it was wonderful.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.633
I met a gorgeous single doctor
on the plane.

03:28.700 --> 03:32.300
Oh, at 30,000 feet, she picks up a doctor.

03:32.367 --> 03:34.233
Now, I see the family resemblance.

03:35.133 --> 03:37.367
In fact, I'm supposed to meet him
in a half hour, if that's ok.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.300
But, darling, you just got here.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.400
Aunt Blanche, you always said,

03:41.467 --> 03:43.600
"If you've got a stallion eating oats
out of your hand,

03:43.667 --> 03:45.400
best close the gate
before you give him the sugar."

03:45.467 --> 03:47.400
(laughing)

03:47.467 --> 03:49.100
You said that, Blanche?

03:50.500 --> 03:52.367
I won't go if you don't want me to...

03:52.433 --> 03:54.200
But I do wanna go, so can I?

03:54.266 --> 03:56.233
-Would your mother let you go?
-No.

03:56.300 --> 03:57.200
Then go.

03:57.266 --> 03:58.600
(shrieks)
Thank you!

03:58.667 --> 04:00.600
Oh, you're the best!

04:00.667 --> 04:01.967
I'll see y'all later!

04:03.000 --> 04:04.700
Oh, isn't she something!

04:04.767 --> 04:06.233
I'm really proud of her.

04:06.734 --> 04:09.934
Now, if I could just manage to rope myself
a doctor that easily.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.133
Honey, I don't think there's enough sugar
left in the bowl.

04:14.433 --> 04:17.433
(mellow music playing)

04:22.100 --> 04:24.767
He's back!
I saw him running across my dresser.

04:24.834 --> 04:25.633
Who's back?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.700
O.J. Simpson, Rose.

04:28.600 --> 04:29.834
The rat is back!

04:30.700 --> 04:32.667
He's not a rat, he's a mouse.

04:32.734 --> 04:35.266
He is history!
I'm calling the exterminator.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.934
Oh, no, Dorothy. Don't do that.

04:37.000 --> 04:37.934
I'll talk to him.

04:38.000 --> 04:39.467
What, you'll talk to the exterminator?

04:39.533 --> 04:41.100
No, the mouse.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.567
I can communicate with animals.

04:45.233 --> 04:48.500
He's just a little field mouse
who's lost his way.

04:48.567 --> 04:50.066
He'll listen to me.

04:50.133 --> 04:51.633
Mice always have.

04:54.066 --> 04:57.033
Rose, do you have any idea
how weird you are?

05:00.934 --> 05:03.533
Girls, I am just beside myself.
I just don't know what to do.

05:03.600 --> 05:04.367
Honey, what's wrong?

05:04.433 --> 05:07.266
Lucy didn't come home last night.
Her bed has not been slept in.

05:07.333 --> 05:09.533
-Calm down, Blanche.
-I'm gonna call the police.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.233
Oh, Blanche, I'm sure she'll be fine.

05:12.700 --> 05:16.066
I mean, what's the worst that can happen
to a 20-year-old girl in Miami?

05:18.066 --> 05:19.233
Oh, my God.

05:20.467 --> 05:22.467
Oh, good morning!

05:22.533 --> 05:25.433
Lucy? For heaven's sake,
where have you been, girl?

05:25.500 --> 05:26.467
I've been worried sick!

05:26.533 --> 05:29.333
Aunt Blanche, only you could understand
what happened.

05:29.967 --> 05:31.600
I am in love!

05:31.667 --> 05:32.667
The doctor?

05:32.734 --> 05:36.066
Oh, he took me on his boat
for a midnight cruise.

05:36.133 --> 05:37.367
It was incredible.

05:37.433 --> 05:41.300
I'd only known him a few hours,
but the evening was so perfect.

05:41.367 --> 05:44.200
I didn't get any sleep,
and I have my interview this afternoon.

05:44.266 --> 05:46.266
I just have to tell you
all about it later.

05:48.467 --> 05:49.767
I don't believe it.

05:50.233 --> 05:51.667
Neither do I.

05:51.734 --> 05:55.633
Imagine, landing herself a doctor,
and she still wants to finish college.

06:02.200 --> 06:05.333
That should give them something
to talk about back in Dogpatch.

06:07.166 --> 06:09.100
Do you approve of what Lucy did?

06:09.166 --> 06:12.000
No, but I am not passing judgment.

06:12.066 --> 06:14.367
Honey, things are very different
these days.

06:14.433 --> 06:16.834
Now, she seems like a levelheaded girl,
and who knows?

06:16.900 --> 06:18.667
Maybe she did fall in love.

06:18.734 --> 06:19.900
That's right, Rose.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.700
She doesn't do this sort of thing
all the time.

06:22.400 --> 06:26.767
Sophia, do you think it's right for a girl
to sleep with a man on their first date?

06:26.834 --> 06:27.934
It's a sin!

06:29.767 --> 06:31.800
See, Sophia agrees with me.

06:31.867 --> 06:33.333
All I said was it's a sin.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.867
Personally,
I'd go back to eating fish on Friday

06:35.934 --> 06:38.066
if his holiness gave that one
the green light.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.066
We're out of milk.

06:42.266 --> 06:45.266
(mellow music playing)

06:48.166 --> 06:48.867
King me.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.934
Ma, you can't do that!

06:51.000 --> 06:53.133
What are you talking about?
It's a perfectly legal double jump.

06:53.200 --> 06:55.734
Yes, but I'm black, you're red!

06:55.800 --> 06:57.900
Hey, it's supposed to be a friendly game.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.633
All of a sudden,
you're playing Vegas rules?

07:01.133 --> 07:01.967
(Lucy) Hi, everyone!

07:02.433 --> 07:04.934
Oh, Lucy, honey, how did the interview go?

07:05.000 --> 07:07.467
Oh, fantastic! Is Aunt Blanche here?

07:07.533 --> 07:08.633
I want to tell her all about it,

07:08.700 --> 07:10.500
and that I won't be home
for dinner tonight.

07:10.567 --> 07:15.133
Oh, your gorgeous doctor
taking you for another midnight cruise?

07:15.200 --> 07:18.066
Oh, no.
Tonight, I'm going out with Michael.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.633
Michael isn't the doctor?

07:20.700 --> 07:22.333
No. Michael's from the university.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.734
He interviewed me.

07:23.800 --> 07:26.900
Oh, he's an absolute dream, he really is.

07:26.967 --> 07:30.367
He is the most stunning hunk
of masculinity I have seen since...

07:30.700 --> 07:31.367
Since...

07:31.433 --> 07:34.467
Since the dazzling doctor from last night?

07:35.300 --> 07:37.467
Lucy, darling, how did the interview go?

07:37.533 --> 07:39.367
Oh, it was great, Aunt Blanche.

07:39.433 --> 07:42.967
I have a feeling I'm gonna be spending
a lot more time here with you in Miami.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.100
Oh, that's wonderful!

07:44.166 --> 07:47.033
So, I hope you won't be upset
if I'm not home for dinner tonight...

07:47.100 --> 07:48.100
or tomorrow night.

07:48.166 --> 07:50.100
Oh, Lucy!

07:50.166 --> 07:51.400
Please, Aunt Blanche.

07:51.467 --> 07:53.166
He wants me to fly
to the Bahamas with him.

07:53.233 --> 07:54.934
The Bahamas?

07:55.667 --> 07:59.100
Well, I suppose you do have to celebrate
doing so well this afternoon.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.100
So, what the heck? Go on!

08:00.166 --> 08:03.200
Oh, thank you, thank you!
I knew you'd understand.

08:03.266 --> 08:04.300
I'll see you-all later.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.066
Oh, I'm so happy
things are going so well for her.

08:08.133 --> 08:09.834
Practically accepted into college,

08:09.900 --> 08:12.600
now she's flying off
to the Bahamas with a doctor.

08:16.500 --> 08:21.166
Uh, Blanche, this trip to the Bahamas,
it is not with the doctor.

08:22.033 --> 08:22.767
What do you mean?

08:22.834 --> 08:24.000
Girl's a slut.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.934
That's not what I meant, exactly.

08:39.266 --> 08:40.767
No, she's going to the Bahamas

08:40.834 --> 08:43.934
with the college interviewer
she met this afternoon.

08:44.567 --> 08:47.900
This is the second man
she's gone away with since she arrived...

08:48.333 --> 08:49.200
yesterday.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.200
Well, she's 20 years old.
She's a young lady.

08:54.266 --> 08:56.233
I don't have any right
to butt into her life.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.066
I think you should talk to her mother.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.133
-Oh, I can't do that.
-Why not?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.200
Because Lucy trusts me.

09:02.266 --> 09:05.467
Ever since she was a little girl,
she and I have confided in each other.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.867
If I betrayed that trust,
she'd never forgive me.

09:07.934 --> 09:09.100
I'd never forgive myself.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.200
Then I think you should talk to her
as soon as she gets back.

09:12.266 --> 09:15.066
I think you're right.
I need to straighten this out.

09:15.133 --> 09:16.400
I don't know what to say to her.

09:16.467 --> 09:18.934
I used to know a girl like that in Sicily.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.133
She slept with every Tom, Dick,
and Vito in our village.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.867
Finally, the women took matters
in their own hands.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.300
They dragged her to the outskirts of town,

09:29.367 --> 09:32.667
threw her on the ground,
and asked her, "Why?

09:32.734 --> 09:34.333
Why would you do such a thing?"

09:34.400 --> 09:35.333
What did she say?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.133
"What else is there to do
in this Godforsaken village?"

09:40.700 --> 09:42.567
Ma, what does this have to do with Lucy?

09:42.633 --> 09:45.066
Not a thing.
It's the only slut story I know.

09:47.066 --> 09:50.066
(mellow music playing)

09:54.900 --> 09:55.967
I'll just be a minute.

09:56.667 --> 09:59.433
Oh, oh. Lucy, you're home.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.000
Aunt Blanche, what are you doing up?

10:01.066 --> 10:03.767
I was waiting up to talk to you, honey.
I guess I dozed off.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.867
-Well, is anything wrong?
-No, everything's fine, really.

10:06.934 --> 10:09.200
Why don't you say good night
to your friend,

10:09.266 --> 10:10.500
and I'll meet you in the kitchen, ok?

10:11.633 --> 10:15.800
Uh, Aunt Blanche, wait.
I wasn't gonna say good night to Ed.

10:15.867 --> 10:17.533
I was just stopping by
to pick up a few things.

10:18.233 --> 10:18.967
What?

10:19.033 --> 10:20.533
Well, it was on the way.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.967
I'm in that new complex over on lakefront.

10:23.033 --> 10:25.467
By the way, I'm Ed Collins, <i>Miami Vice</i>.

10:27.200 --> 10:28.367
Miami what?

10:29.266 --> 10:30.166
Vice.

10:30.233 --> 10:31.633
Ed's with the police department.

10:31.700 --> 10:34.300
Oh. I thought he was with the university.

10:34.367 --> 10:36.133
No, actually, before you left last night,

10:36.200 --> 10:37.934
I thought he was the doctor
from the plane,

10:38.000 --> 10:41.467
and Dorothy explained to me
that he was the university interviewer.

10:41.533 --> 10:45.100
Oh, no, that was Michael,
the guy I flew to the Bahamas with.

10:45.166 --> 10:46.667
I just met ed at the airport.

10:48.367 --> 10:52.100
He arrested Michael for transporting
marijuana from the islands.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.533
Boy, you think you know somebody.

10:56.967 --> 10:57.633
I see.

10:57.700 --> 11:00.467
Well, ed picking up Michael
was doing his job.

11:00.533 --> 11:03.633
You picking up Ed is something
I think the two of us have to discuss.

11:03.700 --> 11:05.934
Ed, it's been a real pleasure. Good night.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.467
Lucy, you're grounded
for the rest of your stay here.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.133
Aunt Blanche, wait.

11:10.200 --> 11:11.734
You're embarrassing me.

11:11.800 --> 11:15.100
Get a good night's sleep,
and we'll talk when I get home tomorrow?

11:15.166 --> 11:17.533
I don't think you heard what I said.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.100
You are not going anywhere.

11:19.767 --> 11:21.800
Aunt Blanche, I'm 20 years old.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.100
I'm going wherever I please.

11:24.834 --> 11:25.800
Come on, Ed.

11:26.934 --> 11:30.000
You walk out that door, missy,
you can forget about coming back!

11:31.100 --> 11:31.934
Lucy!

11:34.500 --> 11:35.934
(footsteps thumping)

11:36.834 --> 11:37.800
Lucy!

11:38.633 --> 11:43.200
(somber music playing)

11:44.667 --> 11:47.667
(mellow music playing)

11:51.100 --> 11:52.467
I just don't understand it.

11:52.533 --> 11:53.867
I forbade her to go,

11:53.934 --> 11:56.266
and she looked me straight in the eye
and walked out that door.

11:56.333 --> 11:57.667
Honey, you have to understand.

11:57.734 --> 12:01.467
Lucy's experiencing
her first taste of freedom.

12:01.533 --> 12:05.300
She's going through a rebellious stage.
Sweetie, it's part of growing up.

12:05.367 --> 12:06.333
Dorothy's right.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.734
I cringe at some of the stunts I pulled

12:08.800 --> 12:10.367
when I was going through
my rebellious stage.

12:10.433 --> 12:13.233
Like what, Rose,
squeezing the cows too hard?

12:14.533 --> 12:15.934
No...

12:16.600 --> 12:19.133
Like climbing out my bedroom window

12:19.200 --> 12:23.367
and stealing my father's truck
to drive into a bar in the city

12:23.433 --> 12:24.667
to meet Clel Lightener.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.200
Clel Lightener?

12:26.266 --> 12:28.066
I think I used that on my hair once.

12:30.133 --> 12:32.300
Oh, Clel was the cutest boy
at our high school.

12:32.834 --> 12:36.033
He was also the only sophomore
old enough to get into a bar.

12:36.967 --> 12:37.633
So...

12:39.300 --> 12:40.900
What did you do when you got there?

12:41.667 --> 12:45.700
Oh, I sat in my father's truck for hours,
paralyzed with fear.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.467
I kept thinking to myself,

12:47.533 --> 12:51.734
"What is a simple protestant farm girl
doing in the parking lot

12:51.800 --> 12:56.166
of a gin mill in a flashy,
fast-paced city like Tyler's landing?"

12:58.633 --> 13:00.467
So, did you get out of the truck, or what?

13:01.133 --> 13:02.200
Of course.

13:02.266 --> 13:03.900
I marched up to the door,

13:03.967 --> 13:08.367
and I ran right into Reverend Mackenzie
coming out of the bar

13:08.433 --> 13:10.166
on the arm of Millie Beasley,

13:10.934 --> 13:15.266
wife of Emmett Beasley,
our town's most decorated war hero.

13:15.934 --> 13:19.233
(sighs)
Emmett received three purple hearts,

13:20.233 --> 13:21.734
all for head wounds.

13:24.300 --> 13:26.333
He ran the feed store in our town.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.700
'Course, if the truth be known,

13:27.767 --> 13:30.400
Millie was the one who had to make change
for the customers.

13:31.834 --> 13:35.333
Rose, are you telling a story
or performing our town?

13:37.300 --> 13:38.734
Oh, sorry.

13:38.800 --> 13:42.033
Anyway, Reverend Mackenzie
made a deal with me.

13:42.467 --> 13:46.333
He said if I didn't tell on him,
he wouldn't tell on me,

13:46.400 --> 13:47.600
so I went home.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.033
Well, did he keep your secret?

13:51.500 --> 13:53.633
Till the day he died...

13:54.300 --> 13:56.000
which was two days later.

13:57.934 --> 14:02.066
Emmett found Millie and the Reverend
skinny-dipping in the church's fountain...

14:03.467 --> 14:05.166
And he shot the both of them.

14:07.166 --> 14:09.633
A week later, we became Lutherans.

14:15.834 --> 14:20.066
Rose,
that isn't a "teenage rebellion" story.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.433
That is a "changing religions" story.

14:23.033 --> 14:24.934
That is a big "who cares?" story.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.467
That is a "Why-the-hell-tell-it-in-
the-first-place?" story!

14:27.533 --> 14:30.300
-Blanche, Blanche.
-Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

14:30.367 --> 14:34.000
But I actually went through
a very rebellious stage as a teenager.

14:34.066 --> 14:35.500
I know how difficult it can be.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.734
What did you do that was so rebellious?

14:39.200 --> 14:41.567
When I was 15,
I dropped out of school for a month

14:41.633 --> 14:43.033
to become a magician's assistant.

14:43.100 --> 14:46.433
When I was 16, I ran off
with a gas station attendant twice my age

14:46.500 --> 14:48.400
to get married in Mexico.

14:48.767 --> 14:50.934
When I was 17, I hitchhiked to New York,

14:51.000 --> 14:54.367
and for two months, I was a Rockette
under an assumed name.

14:56.166 --> 14:59.300
Tyler's landing kind of pales
in comparison.

15:01.734 --> 15:05.166
I stand corrected.
How did you get through all that, Blanche?

15:05.233 --> 15:08.533
I was lucky enough to have
my big sister Charmaine chasing after me,

15:08.600 --> 15:10.200
trying to talk some sense
into my fool head.

15:10.266 --> 15:14.734
Maybe Lucy could use a big sister herself
right now.

15:16.066 --> 15:19.300
If she doesn't already have one,
I don't think it's humanly possible.

15:21.633 --> 15:22.900
I'm going after her.

15:22.967 --> 15:25.333
It's the middle of the night.
You can't go alone!

15:25.400 --> 15:26.200
We'll all go.

15:26.266 --> 15:27.800
(all scream)

15:27.867 --> 15:30.200
-What are we screaming at?
-I'm not sure. Dorothy?

15:30.266 --> 15:31.834
The mouse, the mouse!

15:31.900 --> 15:34.133
Rose, you promised
that you'd get rid of it!

15:34.200 --> 15:36.000
Oh, I'm sorry, Dorothy.

15:36.066 --> 15:37.300
I tried to reason with him,

15:37.367 --> 15:39.867
but he just didn't seem to understand
why he had to leave.

15:40.767 --> 15:42.834
Oh, I thought I had him convinced,

15:42.900 --> 15:45.333
but at the last minute,
he changed his mind,

15:45.400 --> 15:48.600
which surprised me,
because mice aren't usually fickle.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.633
But this mouse is an odd duck.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.900
Rose, how many head wounds have you had?

16:00.400 --> 16:03.400
(quirky music playing)

16:13.433 --> 16:15.967
I know a lot of people
prefer Sonny Crockett on the show,

16:16.033 --> 16:18.467
but me, I'm strictly a Tubbs man.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.066
I've never seen the show.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.667
You've never seen <i>Miami Vice</i>?

16:22.467 --> 16:24.600
It's only the best show
that's ever been on television...

16:24.667 --> 16:25.400
ever!

16:25.467 --> 16:26.567
(knock on door)

16:27.467 --> 16:29.400
It's in stereo, for Pete's sake!

16:32.300 --> 16:33.633
Oh, I'd like to see my niece.

16:33.700 --> 16:34.633
Sure, come on in.

16:35.333 --> 16:37.500
Aunt Blanche, I can't believe you're here.

16:37.567 --> 16:39.266
Haven't you embarrassed me enough already?

16:39.333 --> 16:41.100
Lucy, can we please talk in private?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.767
Whatever you have to say to me,
you can say right here.

16:43.834 --> 16:45.033
I have no secrets from, um...

16:45.600 --> 16:46.400
-Ed.
-Ed.

16:48.066 --> 16:50.533
If you need some privacy,
you can use my bedroom.

16:50.600 --> 16:51.333
Thank you.

16:54.533 --> 16:56.433
Please, ladies, have a seat.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.133
Can I get you ladies anything to drink?

17:01.200 --> 17:02.100
Oh, no, thank you.

17:02.967 --> 17:04.734
I like your apartment.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.100
Thank you.

17:07.166 --> 17:09.633
It kind of looks like something
out of <i>Miami Vice</i>.

17:09.700 --> 17:10.633
Really?

17:11.266 --> 17:12.467
Are you a fan of the show?

17:12.533 --> 17:13.633
I adore it.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.800
Me too!

17:15.200 --> 17:17.333
<i>Miami Vice</i> has been the biggest influence
on my life.

17:17.400 --> 17:19.133
That's why I joined the police force.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.867
That's why I drive a fancy car.
That's why I wear expensive Italian suits.

17:21.934 --> 17:23.767
That's why I'm up to my neck in hock.

17:25.133 --> 17:27.400
You can't afford all that stuff
on a Vice cop's salary.

17:29.233 --> 17:30.200
Who knew, huh?

17:32.000 --> 17:33.867
Aunt Blanche, I'm a grown woman.

17:33.934 --> 17:36.133
I can live my life any way I want to.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.300
Oh, I know that.

17:37.367 --> 17:39.867
I just don't think this is the way
you really wanna live it.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.300
Is it my fault men find me attractive?

17:42.367 --> 17:43.100
No, honey.

17:43.166 --> 17:46.166
What they find you is available,
and that's no compliment.

17:46.233 --> 17:49.033
I find this very strange coming from you,
Aunt Blanche,

17:49.100 --> 17:51.734
'cause from the stories I've heard,
you're not exactly a saint.

17:53.200 --> 17:54.133
No, you're right.

17:54.200 --> 17:56.467
I do enjoy the company of gentlemen,
always have.

17:57.166 --> 17:58.667
But I can promise you one thing, Lucy,

17:58.734 --> 18:00.600
when I'm with a man,
it's 'cause I like him,

18:00.667 --> 18:02.166
not 'cause I want him to like me.

18:02.967 --> 18:05.233
Well, what's wrong
with wanting to be liked?

18:06.033 --> 18:08.266
Aunt Blanche, do you remember
what I looked like as a kid?

18:08.333 --> 18:10.500
Oh, yes, I do. You were a beautiful child.

18:10.567 --> 18:11.834
I was not.

18:12.400 --> 18:15.400
I was short and fat with braces and acne.

18:16.400 --> 18:17.967
And I used to think to myself,

18:18.033 --> 18:20.834
"Oh, I would give anything
to be just like my Aunt Blanche,

18:20.900 --> 18:24.600
to be pretty and popular
with lots of friends."

18:25.266 --> 18:26.934
And then when I turned 16,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.667
it seemed like everything changed
overnight.

18:29.734 --> 18:33.066
I shot up and out, the braces came off...

18:33.667 --> 18:36.300
And finally,
the boys started to notice me.

18:36.367 --> 18:40.033
And it was nice to be noticed,
to be liked.

18:40.900 --> 18:41.600
Oh, baby.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.800
Honey, you've been trying so hard
to get everybody to like you

18:45.867 --> 18:47.934
that you never got around
to liking yourself.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.433
And if you don't like yourself,
you can't respect yourself,

18:50.500 --> 18:54.133
and if you can't respect yourself,
neither can anybody else.

18:56.734 --> 18:57.867
Why don't you come on home?

18:58.900 --> 19:01.433
We still have one more week
before you have to leave.

19:01.934 --> 19:03.700
I don't want to spend it
fighting with you.

19:03.767 --> 19:06.166
I want to enjoy
being with my favorite niece!

19:06.834 --> 19:07.600
(sighs)

19:08.567 --> 19:10.934
Ohh!

19:11.934 --> 19:13.200
Ok, how about this one,

19:13.667 --> 19:17.300
what was the name of the informant
who Crockett and Tubbs accidentally set up

19:17.633 --> 19:19.333
in the <i>Cool Running</i> episode?

19:19.400 --> 19:20.233
There's no way!

19:20.300 --> 19:23.300
That was Noogie, better known
on the street as "The Noog Man."

19:23.967 --> 19:25.333
(laughs)

19:25.400 --> 19:27.934
Rose, you're just incredible
on <i>Miami Vice</i> trivia.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.600
I've never met anyone so smart!

19:30.233 --> 19:33.133
Ed, for a policeman, you've
led a very sheltered life.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.233
Come on, everybody, we're going home.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.033
But I just put popcorn in the microwave.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.066
Oh, listen, Ed, I'm sorry.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.433
You're a nice guy, but I have to go.

19:43.500 --> 19:44.667
I understand, Lucy.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.133
Would you mind if I gave you a call
sometime?

19:47.200 --> 19:49.400
Sure, I guess that'd be ok.

19:49.467 --> 19:50.800
Not you, Lucy. I was talking to Rose.

19:53.033 --> 19:55.200
Oh, I don't think so.

19:55.266 --> 19:56.200
Are you sure?

19:56.767 --> 19:59.200
Tuesday night, I'm getting together
with a couple of buddies.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.066
We're going through don Johnson's trash!

20:02.633 --> 20:03.433
No.

20:03.500 --> 20:04.467
Good night, Ed.

20:05.266 --> 20:06.433
We're going to go home now.

20:06.500 --> 20:07.300
And I want you to know,

20:07.367 --> 20:10.867
we'll all sleep a lot better
knowing you're off duty tonight.

20:12.934 --> 20:15.934
(mellow music playing)

20:31.333 --> 20:33.100
Gotcha!

20:33.166 --> 20:34.767
Trapped like a rat.

20:37.266 --> 20:38.967
Ok, so you're a mouse.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.166
Either way, you're out of here.

20:42.367 --> 20:46.633
Oh, listen, you had your chance to leave,
and you didn't take it...

20:48.066 --> 20:49.333
And now I have to kill you.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.567
I mean, I'm probably doing you a favor.

20:54.633 --> 20:57.400
I mean, what kind of life are you having?

20:58.100 --> 21:00.734
What, you hang around sewers,
you eat garbage.

21:01.734 --> 21:03.233
That's not living, honey.

21:04.500 --> 21:05.433
Now, believe me,

21:05.500 --> 21:08.066
you'll be better off
once I put you out of your misery.

21:10.667 --> 21:11.333
(sighs)

21:12.300 --> 21:16.934
I have never killed another living thing
in my entire life.

21:18.433 --> 21:19.633
All right, a bug.

21:19.700 --> 21:21.233
Yes, I have killed bugs...

21:21.834 --> 21:22.900
But they don't count.

21:23.734 --> 21:25.934
I don't know why, they just don't!

21:27.900 --> 21:29.233
I don't believe this!

21:30.100 --> 21:31.700
I'm talking to a mouse.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.767
The scary part is,
I think you're listening.

21:37.734 --> 21:41.333
Oh, look, I beg you, mammal to mammal.

21:42.133 --> 21:43.200
Please go!

21:43.767 --> 21:45.900
Look, the exterminator said

21:45.967 --> 21:48.200
that you came in
through a hole under the sink.

21:48.266 --> 21:50.033
Please, that's the way I'd like you to go.

21:53.633 --> 21:55.834
Oh, good boy!

21:56.900 --> 21:58.100
Ohh!

21:58.166 --> 22:00.033
You have the gift!

22:01.700 --> 22:02.433
Oh!

22:03.066 --> 22:03.800
Oh!

22:03.867 --> 22:04.533
Oh, Rose!

22:04.600 --> 22:07.166
Tell me, how long have you been
standing there?

22:07.233 --> 22:09.800
Dorothy, I heard you talking
to that little mouse.

22:09.867 --> 22:13.066
-It was beautiful.
-I wasn't talking to a mouse.

22:13.133 --> 22:14.700
Yes, you were. I saw you.

22:14.767 --> 22:16.367
I was kidding!

22:16.433 --> 22:19.967
Oh, Dorothy,
it's nothing to be ashamed of.

22:20.033 --> 22:22.467
There are only a few of us privileged

22:22.533 --> 22:24.533
to have the gift to communicate
with animals.

22:25.433 --> 22:27.433
Lucy's ready to leave.
Come on and say goodbye.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.533
We'll be right there.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.066
Rose Nylund, if you ever breathe a word
of this to anyone,

22:31.133 --> 22:32.166
I swear, I'll kill you!

22:32.233 --> 22:35.467
Oh, Dorothy, don't be silly.
You couldn't even kill a little mouse.

22:37.567 --> 22:39.900
That's because you can communicate
with them.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.266
Oh, Dorothy, one word of caution.

22:43.734 --> 22:45.433
It's a powerful gift.

22:45.967 --> 22:47.300
Use it wisely.

22:54.533 --> 22:57.233
You let me know the minute you decide
where you're going to school, you hear?

22:57.300 --> 23:02.767
I will. Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you for loving me so much.

23:03.033 --> 23:05.233
These last few days
have really made a difference.

23:06.066 --> 23:08.266
Sophia, oh, thank you.

23:08.333 --> 23:11.233
Dorothy, Rose,
I hope I wasn't too much trouble.

23:11.300 --> 23:14.100
-Don't be silly.
-We enjoyed having you.

23:14.166 --> 23:16.233
-So did half of Miami.
-Ma!

23:22.000 --> 23:22.767
(giggles)

23:22.834 --> 23:24.367
-Have a safe trip!
-Ok.

23:24.433 --> 23:25.633
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

23:26.266 --> 23:29.467
Blanche, exactly what did you say
to Lucy that night

23:29.533 --> 23:30.533
at Ed's apartment?

23:30.600 --> 23:32.467
Oh, I told her a lot of things.

23:32.533 --> 23:35.433
I told her she was a bright,
charming, funny young lady

23:35.500 --> 23:37.767
who didn't have to rely
upon sex to be liked.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.934
Well, good for you, Blanche.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.867
You know, I hadn't realized
how much she's been looking up to me.

23:43.333 --> 23:45.600
I think the thing that really
turned her around

23:45.667 --> 23:47.600
was when I told her
that when it comes to men,

23:47.667 --> 23:49.266
I'm just a lot of talk.

23:49.934 --> 23:52.967
Embellishment's one of the oldest
traditions in the south.

23:53.033 --> 23:54.834
Tall tales and tall drinks.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.233
(giggles)

23:56.300 --> 23:59.133
I don't really sleep around near
as much as I say I do.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.400
Is that true, Blanche?

24:03.233 --> 24:04.800
Maybe it is and maybe it isn't!

24:05.867 --> 24:11.333
(lively music playing)

24:13.066 --> 24:16.066
(closing theme music playing)
