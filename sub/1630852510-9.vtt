23:23.436 --> 23:24.768

23:24.837 --> 23:27.171
Oh...

23:27.240 --> 23:29.773
(paper crinkles)
whew!

23:29.809 --> 23:33.043
Someone is gettin' paid!

23:33.112 --> 23:34.912
A lotta people, apparently.

23:34.981 --> 23:37.181
Okay. Hold on to that.
Thank you.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.918
Huh.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.853
(tapping) bingo.

23:42.855 --> 23:44.388
<i> Alphonse: Can I get your coat</i>
<i> or anything?</i>

23:44.523 --> 23:46.190
<i> Flora: Can I just have</i>
<i> a glass of water?</i>

23:46.259 --> 23:47.858
<i> My mouth's really dry.</i>
<i> - I can do that.</i>

23:47.927 --> 23:49.260
<i> (footsteps approach)</i>

23:49.395 --> 23:51.061
- Flora, I'm jenny cooper.
I'm the coroner

23:51.197 --> 23:53.597
That's investigating
the brownings' deaths.

23:53.666 --> 23:57.801
Um, I have a few questions that
I'm hoping you can help me with.

23:57.804 --> 24:01.071
- The detectives already
confirmed my alibi.

24:01.140 --> 24:02.740
(pill lid clicks)
- it's not about that.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.140
(pills rattle)

24:04.177 --> 24:06.843
- They're just my prescription.
- Yup.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.013
(lid snaps closed,
pills rattle)

24:09.015 --> 24:12.449
Uh, I know things are stressful.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.017
- You do?

24:15.221 --> 24:16.687
Do you?

24:19.158 --> 24:22.092
(sniffs the air,
shaky breath)

24:22.161 --> 24:24.194
Is aaron here? (gasps)

24:24.230 --> 24:26.563
<i> He has a very distinct scent.</i>

24:26.632 --> 24:29.199
It's uh...
His cologne, I mean.

24:30.269 --> 24:32.369
<i> (footsteps recede)</i>

24:32.371 --> 24:33.570
- Impressive.

24:36.242 --> 24:39.309
Aaron is in the boardroom
with detective mcavoy.

24:39.378 --> 24:41.378
- What is he saying?

24:41.447 --> 24:44.782
- Flora, I understand that
you have a relationship

24:44.784 --> 24:46.850
With the brownings--
- you don't understand anything.

24:46.853 --> 24:49.019
- Flora, I--
aaron: Flora!

24:49.154 --> 24:50.788
I thought that was you. Hey.

24:50.790 --> 24:53.123
Both: (exhale deeply)

24:54.326 --> 24:57.427
<i> - Have you seen him?</i>
<i> - No.</i>

24:57.463 --> 25:00.064
- (shakily) no?

25:00.066 --> 25:02.266
(shallow, shaky breaths)

25:02.335 --> 25:04.868
- Okay, enough's enough.
We wanna see caleb.

25:04.937 --> 25:08.138
- And I wanna know why you two
are trying to protect someone

25:08.207 --> 25:10.307
Who just committed a brutal
double homicide?

25:10.442 --> 25:11.842
I mean, I get family loyalty,

25:11.844 --> 25:13.643
<i> But doesn't that extend</i>
<i> to your parents, aaron?</i>

25:13.679 --> 25:16.112
And to people who were like
second parents to you, flora?

25:17.950 --> 25:20.351
- We knew this day was coming.
- (shouting) can I please...

25:20.486 --> 25:24.154
(calmly) can I please have just
a minute with aaron? Please?

25:25.491 --> 25:27.524
(donovan's phone rings)

25:27.593 --> 25:29.426
- Okay, uh, you can go in
the boardroom.

25:29.462 --> 25:30.828
<i> - (relieved sigh)</i>

25:30.830 --> 25:32.662
<i> - I'll, uh, I'll grab</i>
<i> some coffees.</i>

25:36.702 --> 25:39.302
I'll keep an eye on them.
- Okay.

25:39.338 --> 25:41.004
Yeah. Yeah, malik?

25:43.842 --> 25:45.442
(easy listening music plays
softly)

25:45.478 --> 25:47.844
You know, last year,
mom was so busy with work

25:47.914 --> 25:51.648
That our centrepiece
was a sad dollar-store elf.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.683
- Oh.
- (chuckles)

25:56.389 --> 25:59.189
You know that she's a coroner,
right?

25:59.258 --> 26:01.691
Did I tell you that?
- I know.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.862
- Yeah, well,
she helps people -

26:04.997 --> 26:07.731
People who've lost somebody -
get closure.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.266
- Yeah, I suppose it makes
sense,

26:10.303 --> 26:12.169
Given what she's been through.

26:12.304 --> 26:14.405
(soft music plays)

26:14.540 --> 26:16.473
- You talkin' about katie?

26:18.878 --> 26:21.945
- You know, when katie died,
uh,

26:21.981 --> 26:25.549
We all dealt with it
in our own way.

26:27.019 --> 26:30.520
I'm glad to see that hers
was healthier than mine.

26:34.893 --> 26:36.960
- Why, why didn't you...

26:37.029 --> 26:40.063
Why didn't you ever reach out?

26:41.634 --> 26:44.000
- I tried on her 16th birthday,

26:45.071 --> 26:46.803
<i> But jenny made it very clear</i>

26:46.805 --> 26:50.441
That she didn't want anything
to do with me.

26:50.576 --> 26:52.676
I know that I left it too late,

26:52.678 --> 26:54.912
But... (clears throat)

26:55.047 --> 26:57.547
The healing takes as long
as it takes.

26:58.917 --> 27:00.984
And when I was ready,

27:00.987 --> 27:03.320
Well, she wasn't.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.324
- But what about grandpa?
I mean, didn't you miss him?

27:08.361 --> 27:10.293
Didn't you want to talk to him?

27:12.398 --> 27:14.764
- They were always a fine pair,
those two, you know.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.802
And gord has raised her well.

27:18.804 --> 27:21.204
She got straight a's,
she went to med school,

27:21.206 --> 27:23.907
She got married,
she had you.

27:25.011 --> 27:27.344
They're thriving without me,
ross.

27:27.413 --> 27:28.778
(flowers rustle)

27:29.815 --> 27:31.781
(easy listening music plays)

27:34.487 --> 27:36.954
- She has anxiety
and panic attacks.

27:38.624 --> 27:40.691
<i> He has dementia.</i>

27:40.693 --> 27:43.226
<i> He's even started</i>
<i> hallucinating.</i>

27:43.262 --> 27:45.162
You're what he sees.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.433
<i> Look, I know that</i>
<i> it's complicated</i>

27:49.435 --> 27:52.869
And I know that there's
feelings everywhere, but...

27:54.173 --> 27:55.705
(blows out his breath)

27:55.741 --> 27:57.006
What if you just came
to christmas dinner?

27:57.043 --> 27:58.842
- Oh, ross.
- I've set you a place card,

27:58.977 --> 28:00.944
We have tonnes of food,
we have lots of space.

28:00.980 --> 28:03.080
- It's too late.

28:03.082 --> 28:06.316
I'm sorry,
but that's the truth.

28:09.255 --> 28:10.820
- Yeah, well...

28:11.857 --> 28:14.257
I'm sorry, too.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.060
(jacket rustles)
- ross, I...

28:18.264 --> 28:20.464
(plastic rustles,
door thuds shut)

28:24.203 --> 28:25.669
(exhales)

28:29.808 --> 28:31.007
- (sighs)

28:31.077 --> 28:32.809
<i> (footsteps approach)</i>

28:32.878 --> 28:34.611
- That was malik.

28:34.647 --> 28:36.146
John browning's been making
cash payments

28:36.215 --> 28:38.549
To a dozen people, monthly.
Going back decades.

28:38.684 --> 28:40.184
- Payments to who?
- Don't know.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.886
The ledger only had first names
and dollar amounts,

28:43.021 --> 28:45.088
But there's one name
that malik recognized...

28:46.659 --> 28:49.026
- Flora?
- $1,000 a month,

28:49.161 --> 28:51.228
Starting in June 1999.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.429
- What happened in June
of 1999?

28:53.466 --> 28:55.265
- I think it's time we take
them down to the station,

28:55.334 --> 28:57.200
Get them talking on the record.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.407
(indistinct chatter)

29:05.578 --> 29:07.511
Dennis: Whatcha workin' on
over there?

29:07.580 --> 29:10.413
- The cysts you found on
mr. Browning's liver.

29:10.449 --> 29:13.116
I'm sending a sample to the lab
for a biopsy.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.185
I know you like being thorough.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.786
- River...
(liver thuds)

29:18.124 --> 29:21.258
Look, if it's a choice between
this job or being with you,

29:21.393 --> 29:23.193
I choose you.

29:23.229 --> 29:25.095
Wait, let me finish.

29:25.164 --> 29:26.930
Because technically,

29:26.932 --> 29:29.132
We started dating before
I became your quasi-boss,

29:29.201 --> 29:30.900
So it might not even be a thing.

29:32.138 --> 29:34.271
So, I guess what I'm saying
is...

29:35.741 --> 29:38.141
(flowers and gloves rustle)

29:38.144 --> 29:40.744
River baitz,

29:40.879 --> 29:43.080
Will you talk to hr with me?

29:43.215 --> 29:44.948
- (chuckles)

29:45.017 --> 29:47.917
Yes. Yes, I will.

29:49.555 --> 29:51.888
- Whew! Yes.

29:56.362 --> 29:58.328
(crayon scratches)

30:04.036 --> 30:05.935
Dr. Sharma: Very good, caleb.

30:05.971 --> 30:09.473
Got one more test to assess
your working memory.

30:10.676 --> 30:11.775
(handcuffs jingle)

30:11.910 --> 30:13.944
- Um, no. Uh...

30:15.881 --> 30:17.447
Can you take your mask off?

30:17.449 --> 30:19.515
I'm kind of, just like,
freaking out

30:19.552 --> 30:21.718
And the masks are not helping.

30:23.522 --> 30:25.521
- Okay.

30:30.429 --> 30:33.797
Have you had anything to eat
or drink today, caleb?

30:33.866 --> 30:35.265
- I don't think so.

30:35.400 --> 30:37.668
<i> - Would you like a sandwich,</i>
<i> if I can track one down?</i>

30:37.803 --> 30:40.070

Aaron: Um... (clears throat)

31:07.299 --> 31:10.433
Our family is very concerned
with appearances.

31:11.570 --> 31:14.237
My father had this idea
of how boys should be,

31:15.574 --> 31:19.208
And uh... But caleb was
sensitive and sweet.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.078
He was weak.

31:22.147 --> 31:24.080
<i> (clears throat)</i>
<i> so, my dad took him hunting</i>

31:24.116 --> 31:26.783
For deer and feral pigs.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.719
He taught him how
to field dress them.

31:29.988 --> 31:31.754
Thought it would toughen him up,

31:31.790 --> 31:33.724
But then, caleb started to,

31:33.859 --> 31:35.859
Uh, to change.

31:35.994 --> 31:37.661
He started to...

31:38.797 --> 31:39.996
To have these like...

31:41.066 --> 31:43.766
- Fits.
- What kind of fits?

31:43.802 --> 31:45.836
- Oh, flashes of rage
he couldn't control.

31:45.838 --> 31:47.270
He'd have an explosion

31:47.339 --> 31:50.974
And then your dad would
take him out hunting.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.343
And then he'd come back

31:53.379 --> 31:56.413
And we'd cook up
whatever they'd killed.

31:56.415 --> 31:59.282
- Hmm. When did the violence
start?

31:59.285 --> 32:01.017
- When caleb was seven.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.619
- No, he was a bit older than...
Than that.

32:03.656 --> 32:05.689

32:05.691 --> 32:07.623

32:08.661 --> 32:10.593

32:12.665 --> 32:14.063

32:14.099 --> 32:16.166
- What happened in June of '99,
flora?

32:16.168 --> 32:19.969
- Well, you have to understand
that caleb loves flora.

32:20.005 --> 32:22.439
He would never hurt her...

32:22.508 --> 32:25.108
- It's okay.
- On purpose.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.943
- It's okay.

32:28.981 --> 32:32.449
- It was my birthday and um...

32:32.451 --> 32:34.651
- I gave him a red bike.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.320
- Which was caleb's favourite
colour.

32:37.423 --> 32:39.323
- I should've known that.

32:39.458 --> 32:41.057
- What did he do?

32:41.126 --> 32:43.292
- He pushed me down a flight
of stairs.

32:45.397 --> 32:47.864
- It was horrible.

32:47.866 --> 32:49.665
And he felt so bad.

32:49.702 --> 32:51.134
- Yeah, my parents thought
it would be best

32:51.136 --> 32:53.003
If we didn't involve the police

32:53.005 --> 32:55.772
And well, john and ginny they...
- Mm-hmm.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.607
- They felt the same, so.
- Mm-hmm.

32:57.743 --> 32:59.676
- Is that when mr. Browning
started paying you?

33:01.280 --> 33:03.112
- Paying you?

33:05.150 --> 33:08.485
- I... I thought this was to pay
for my, my physio,

33:08.487 --> 33:11.087
But then, the money just never
stopped coming.

33:14.893 --> 33:17.961
- Dad paid you? That's why you
stayed in our lives.
