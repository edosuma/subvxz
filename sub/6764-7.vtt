01:39.479 --> 01:41.743
- You guys, let's just start without her.
- No.

01:41.915 --> 01:45.373
lf this is gonna be our official sorority
meeting, then we're gonna do it right.

01:45.552 --> 01:51.047
Here we go. One for you,
and one for you, and one for you.

01:51.224 --> 01:52.748
- Thank you.
- And one for me.

01:53.727 --> 01:55.558
- Sorry l'm late.
- New dress?

01:55.729 --> 01:58.527
Oh, this old thing?
Well, it's not too incredible or anything.

01:58.698 --> 01:59.824
lt was on sale at Maxwell's.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.264
The best part is l bought it
with my very first paycheck.

02:02.903 --> 02:04.962
Working girl.

02:05.138 --> 02:08.574
- Yeah, well, l hope he likes it.
- He?

02:08.741 --> 02:10.538
You mean she hasn't told you
about Stuart yet?

02:11.044 --> 02:12.909
You're going out with a guy
named Stuart?

02:13.079 --> 02:15.673
l know, but you're gonna love him.
He is very sweet.

02:15.849 --> 02:18.215
How did you meet him?

02:18.385 --> 02:19.909
Actually, my father set us up.

02:20.787 --> 02:22.618
Hold on. We will get the dirt on this

02:22.789 --> 02:24.654
and other major matters
right after the meeting.

02:25.091 --> 02:26.820
Well, how long does
a sorority meeting last?

02:26.993 --> 02:29.553
Well, at the Alpha House,
the secretary reads the minutes.

02:29.729 --> 02:31.754
Then there's old business,
new business.

02:31.932 --> 02:33.024
Then we adjourn the meeting,

02:33.200 --> 02:35.361
and we see who got pinned
and who lost their virginity.

02:35.535 --> 02:38.026
Well, then, l hereby move
for this meeting to be adjourned.

02:38.205 --> 02:39.672
- l second it.
- l second it.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.035
lt's unanimous. Meeting adjourned.

02:42.209 --> 02:45.372
So did anyone get pinned or lose
their virginity over this weekend?

02:45.545 --> 02:48.742
Well, now, Kelly,
l lost my virginity a couple years ago.

02:48.915 --> 02:51.110
Well, l was just wondering
if you and Stuart

02:51.284 --> 02:53.445
had taken a ride
on the roller coaster yet.

02:53.854 --> 02:54.878
No.

02:55.055 --> 02:58.491
But we're going dancing again tonight,
so check back with me tomorrow.

02:58.658 --> 03:01.491
Andrea, let's face it,
we're the last of a dying breed.

03:02.128 --> 03:03.891
Well, from what l hear
from Brandon,

03:04.064 --> 03:06.430
Andrea and her dorm adviser
are getting pretty chummy.

03:08.935 --> 03:11.836
- Dan's a nice guy.
- ls that it?

03:12.372 --> 03:15.170
For now. Get back to me
at the end of the semester.

03:17.711 --> 03:19.770
Well, my love life is a mess,
as usual.

03:19.946 --> 03:22.244
- Thought you liked John Sears.
- And l do.

03:23.250 --> 03:24.581
The timing just couldn't be worse.

03:24.751 --> 03:26.810
The night l break up with Dylan,
he gets carjacked.

03:26.987 --> 03:29.581
- Poor Dylan.
- Well, at least he wasn't hurt.

03:29.756 --> 03:32.589
Well, l think he's feeling
a lot better today.

03:33.093 --> 03:34.355
- Why? Did you talk to him?
- No.

03:34.528 --> 03:36.758
But Brandon did,
and l think they found his car.

04:22.842 --> 04:25.140
Think you'll recognize it, man?
You only had the car a day.

04:25.312 --> 04:27.780
Look, Brandon, how many 91 1 's
you figure they got in this lot?

04:27.948 --> 04:30.109
l don't know, ten, 1 2.
lt is L.A., after all.

04:30.283 --> 04:32.774
What, you think it's right here
under this sheet?

04:33.954 --> 04:35.581
Damn it.

04:35.989 --> 04:37.650
You should be thankful
this isn't your car.

04:37.824 --> 04:40.292
lt's an ugly car. lt's like a nightmare
and it's getting worse.

04:40.460 --> 04:42.860
There's a cop over by that shed.
He probably knows something.

04:43.029 --> 04:44.587
Right.

04:49.970 --> 04:53.838
Excuse me, officer. Listen,
l got a call, said you found my car.

04:54.007 --> 04:55.031
From who?

04:55.208 --> 04:58.109
l don't know. Some guy called
and said you recovered my Porsche.

04:58.278 --> 04:59.609
No Porsches came in this week.

05:00.747 --> 05:01.771
Are you sure, man?

05:01.948 --> 05:04.610
The guy called me up and gave me
the serial number off the engine

05:04.784 --> 05:06.911
and said the car was right here.

05:07.087 --> 05:09.146
Let me see your registration.

05:09.322 --> 05:10.983
Could it be in another impound yard,
maybe?

05:20.433 --> 05:22.492
Seems there was a little mistake,
boys.

05:22.669 --> 05:24.933
The car we recovered
was a Honda Civic.

05:26.039 --> 05:29.304
Wait, you're telling me that l came
down here to this hellhole for nothing?

05:29.476 --> 05:30.602
You don't even have my car?

05:30.777 --> 05:33.302
Sorry, there was a screwup.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.313
A screwup. From the police
department? l'm shocked.

05:36.950 --> 05:40.010
Hey-- Hey. Hey, l'm talking to you.

05:40.186 --> 05:42.586
Listen, he got carjacked
a couple nights ago.

05:42.756 --> 05:43.780
He's just not himself.

05:43.957 --> 05:47.085
Yeah, well, tell your buddy to cool it
before he gets into some real trouble.

05:47.260 --> 05:50.354
Yeah, l'll do my best. Thanks.

06:09.549 --> 06:12.245
- What is so funny?
- Nothing.

06:12.419 --> 06:14.011
Everything. l don't know.

06:14.187 --> 06:17.179
Normally, l'm a real sourpuss.
But when l'm with you, l get giddy.

06:17.357 --> 06:19.689
Well, l have that effect
on depressive types.

06:19.859 --> 06:22.487
- Oh, okay.
- Thank you, Mr. Carson.

06:22.662 --> 06:25.563
You know, you can call me Stuart.
Unless you still hate my name.

06:25.732 --> 06:29.031
No, l'm getting used to it,
but what if l call you Stewie?

06:29.202 --> 06:31.102
The last person who called me that
was my mother.

06:31.271 --> 06:32.533
Scratch that. What about Stu?

06:33.339 --> 06:35.603
As in beef stew?

06:35.775 --> 06:39.336
Well, it's meaty, it's hearty,
it sticks to your ribs.

06:40.447 --> 06:42.608
Oh, that's not working
for you either, is it?

06:42.782 --> 06:44.010
My father used to call me Stu.

06:44.350 --> 06:47.080
But then he developed
some other nicknames.

06:47.253 --> 06:48.811
Like what?

06:49.155 --> 06:51.715
When l dropped out of college,
he called me The Bum.

06:51.891 --> 06:53.791
When l was trying
to promote rock concerts,

06:53.960 --> 06:56.121
he called me The Hippie.

06:56.296 --> 06:59.959
When l tried to get into commercial
real estate, he called me The Fool.

07:00.133 --> 07:02.260
l don't think you wanna know
what he started calling me

07:02.435 --> 07:04.960
when l tried to buy
into some racehorses. Oh, man.

07:06.039 --> 07:07.700
l've never seen that side
of your father.

07:07.874 --> 07:10.707
Well, his true personality only comes
out when he's lecturing me.

07:13.780 --> 07:16.248
How about if l just call you Stuart?

07:17.784 --> 07:18.978
That's good.

07:19.152 --> 07:21.620
Now, could you whisper that
in my ear?

07:22.222 --> 07:23.814
No.

07:29.829 --> 07:30.853
Hey, you night crawIers,

07:31.030 --> 07:33.794
it's 2 a,m,, and time
for the David Silver Show.

07:33.967 --> 07:36.697
Here's David,

07:37.470 --> 07:39.199
Andrea.

07:40.006 --> 07:43.464
Andrea, it's getting late.

07:44.644 --> 07:46.839
l was having
the most amazing dream.

07:47.013 --> 07:49.481
Was there yogurt involved?

07:51.818 --> 07:56.278
No, we were flying. lt was great.

07:56.923 --> 07:59.824
Only now l don't have the strength
to put my clothes on.

07:59.993 --> 08:01.358
So stay.

08:01.528 --> 08:03.120
- No, l can't.
- Stay.

08:03.296 --> 08:06.060
l can't, l can't.

08:06.232 --> 08:08.359
l stayed last night
and l almost missed my first class.

08:08.535 --> 08:12.266
You are not the most dependable
alarm clock.

08:14.641 --> 08:17.166
l wish it didn't have to be this way.

08:17.343 --> 08:18.401
Today l was with my friends

08:18.578 --> 08:20.307
and they kept talking
about their boyfriends.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.141
l couldn't even say a word.

08:22.615 --> 08:26.107
Andrea, we both agreed
it's for the best we don't go public.

08:28.121 --> 08:30.351
lt's not fair.

08:30.523 --> 08:32.251
l mean...

08:32.958 --> 08:34.620
lt's not like
you're my teacher anymore.

08:34.794 --> 08:38.092
l looked at the college guidelines
on resident advisers.

08:38.264 --> 08:40.357
They do not have
a non-fraternization rule.

08:40.533 --> 08:44.059
No, not specifically,

08:44.737 --> 08:46.967
but how it's interpreted
is a whole other matter.

08:48.474 --> 08:52.274
What's the worst thing that could
happen if they find out about us?

08:52.645 --> 08:54.010
Oh, l don't know.

08:54.180 --> 08:56.478
And l don't wanna know.

08:57.317 --> 08:58.807
Do you?

09:02.255 --> 09:04.120
Sleep well.

09:10.530 --> 09:12.191
Thanks.

09:15.335 --> 09:17.235
- Bye.
- Hey, invite me in?

09:17.904 --> 09:20.998
- What?
- lnvite me in.

09:21.174 --> 09:23.301
Yeah, right.
My parents are probably inside

09:23.476 --> 09:25.171
waiting with the lights turned down.

09:25.345 --> 09:28.314
Good. lf they're up, l'll just explain
why l can't bear to live without you.

09:29.449 --> 09:31.280
Stuart,
l think we'd better call it a night.

09:31.451 --> 09:33.146
Easy for you. l'm not letting you go.

09:33.319 --> 09:35.082
What are you doing?
You cannot come in.

09:35.255 --> 09:38.520
- You're coming back to my place.
- No, Stuart.

09:38.691 --> 09:39.783
Put me down.

09:41.761 --> 09:44.321
Your wish is my command.

09:44.864 --> 09:46.695
So...

09:49.369 --> 09:51.530
Did l sweep you off your feet?

09:52.071 --> 09:55.370
Look, this is so good. l don't think
that we should rock the boat.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.566
l don't wanna rock the boat.

09:57.744 --> 09:58.836
l wanna sink the boat.

10:03.616 --> 10:04.640
Go.

10:21.234 --> 10:22.394
Brenda, we have to talk.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.004
Look, l know l'm late.

10:28.174 --> 10:30.699
We just lost track of the time,
and l'm really sorry.

10:31.444 --> 10:33.105
Well, that's a start.

10:33.279 --> 10:35.543
We have to lay down
some very clear rules, young lady.

10:35.715 --> 10:37.546
l don't get it. What's the problem?

10:37.717 --> 10:39.446
l mean, l'm working,
l'm going to school.

10:39.619 --> 10:42.383
You guys just go on with your lives,
and l promise l'll be fine.

10:42.555 --> 10:46.855
Brenda, this is the third time this week
you've come in at 3 a.m.

10:49.195 --> 10:50.822
Well, look at it this way.

10:50.997 --> 10:53.295
Consider yourselves lucky
l came home at all.

10:56.636 --> 10:58.194
Good night.

11:09.882 --> 11:12.612
Well, things are back to normal
at the old Walsh household.

11:12.785 --> 11:13.809
Mom's talking to herself.

11:13.987 --> 11:16.615
Dad's coming to me for advice,
and you're back in the old doghouse.

11:16.789 --> 11:18.154
No, l'm one foot out the door.

11:19.759 --> 11:21.784
So, what's really going on
with you and Stuart?

11:21.961 --> 11:23.952
- What do you think is going on?
- Oh, l don't know.

11:24.130 --> 11:27.395
He's rich, he's good-looking,
he's rich.

11:27.567 --> 11:28.898
There's gotta be a catch.

11:29.068 --> 11:31.502
You know,
you're worse than Mom and Dad.

11:32.705 --> 11:34.263
Are you saying
this guy's all together?

11:34.440 --> 11:36.135
Brandon,
let me put it to you this way.

11:36.309 --> 11:37.742
There's never been anyone
in my life,

11:37.910 --> 11:41.744
including Dylan McKay,
who knows how to...

11:43.950 --> 11:47.386
- How to what?
- l'm trying to find the right word.

11:48.321 --> 11:49.515
How to woo.

11:49.689 --> 11:51.350
Stuart gives good woo?

11:51.524 --> 11:52.548
The best.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.620
ln that case, does he have
a twin sister who's as rich as he is?

12:01.334 --> 12:03.063
And if you've done the reading,
don't worry.

12:03.236 --> 12:07.002
You will not fall below
the Mendoza Line for a grade of C.

12:07.173 --> 12:09.869
- Yeah?
- The Mendoza Line?

12:10.043 --> 12:11.738
- Was that in the chapters?
- Mendoza Line?

12:11.911 --> 12:14.539
No, that's not in your reading,
will not be on the test.

12:14.714 --> 12:17.911
So if there's nothing else,
look, life is short, study hard.

12:18.317 --> 12:20.182
Class dismissed.

12:20.820 --> 12:23.755
lt looks like l'm gonna be in all night
studying my notes. Wanna come over?

12:23.923 --> 12:25.948
l don't think so.
l'm not gonna sweat this one.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.558
Steve, you're gonna brick this test.

12:27.727 --> 12:30.560
You're gonna find yourself below
his Mendoza Line, whatever that is.

12:31.164 --> 12:34.793
l don't think so. You see, the KEG
House has this one-hour super cram.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.832
Guaranteed to bring you
up to speed on any exam.

12:37.003 --> 12:38.027
One hour?

12:38.204 --> 12:40.832
Yeah, l can let you in on some
of these frat secrets if you'd like.

12:41.007 --> 12:43.305
l think l'll stay away from
your shortcuts, Mr. Legacy Key.

12:43.476 --> 12:45.034
Mr. Begging-
Mrs.-Teasley-to-Graduate.

12:45.211 --> 12:48.203
ls this why you took down
Professor Randall's office hours?

12:48.381 --> 12:50.474
Maybe you're planning
on sucking up a little bit, huh?

12:50.650 --> 12:52.208
No, l'm not planning on sucking up.

12:52.385 --> 12:54.046
l don't wanna be another face
in the crowd.

12:54.220 --> 12:55.744
There's nothing wrong
with personalizing

12:55.922 --> 12:58.083
the student-teacher relationship,
l read that somewhere.

12:58.257 --> 13:01.317
- l think it was Dante.
- ln other words, you are sucking up.

13:01.727 --> 13:02.751
Give me a break, will you?

13:02.929 --> 13:04.726
Between Brenda's undeclared war
on my parents

13:04.897 --> 13:06.888
and Dylan's psychosis,
l don't know what's going on.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.761
lt's gotta be rough
getting your car jacked.

13:08.935 --> 13:09.959
Yeah, it's not only that.

13:10.136 --> 13:12.229
Kelly tells him she wants
to start dating other people

13:12.405 --> 13:14.498
like an hour before this kid
sticks a gun in his face.

13:14.674 --> 13:16.335
Don't tell anyone, though,
it's top-secret.

13:16.509 --> 13:17.771
lt's no secret at the KEG House.

13:17.944 --> 13:20.504
Everyone knows John Sears
is going out with her.

13:23.316 --> 13:25.784
So you figure if the insurance
company is willing to settle,

13:25.952 --> 13:28.443
then there's not much chance
of ever finding it, am l right?

13:29.155 --> 13:30.179
The claims officer said

13:30.356 --> 13:34.258
that if a stolen vehicle
is not recovered in the first 48 hours,

13:34.427 --> 13:38.124
it's already at a chop shop
or halfway down to Guadalajara.

13:38.297 --> 13:39.992
l hate to admit it,
but you were right, Jim.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.157
l shouldn't have bought that car
in the first place.

13:42.335 --> 13:45.065
You're covered for a rental vehicle
until you wanna buy a new one.

13:45.238 --> 13:47.069
Any idea what you might want?

13:47.240 --> 13:49.265
Oh, l don't know.
l was thinking maybe a tank.

13:49.442 --> 13:51.603
Urban assault vehicle,
that kind of thing.

13:52.145 --> 13:54.010
l'm glad to see you still have
a sense of humor.

13:54.180 --> 13:55.442
ls that what this is?

13:55.615 --> 13:58.880
You know, in a situation like that,
there's nothing you could have done.

13:59.051 --> 14:01.747
Well, l don't know, Jim. l mean,
l could've jammed through the light.

14:01.921 --> 14:04.651
l could've honked my horn,
backed up and knocked the guy over,

14:04.824 --> 14:07.691
and l didn't do any
of those things, man. l froze.

14:09.729 --> 14:14.132
l thought maybe the kid was lost,
you know, then he whips out this gun.

14:14.300 --> 14:17.861
l got the barrel right in my face,
and l'm looking down that little hole.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.835
And l saw my whole life in that hole.

14:21.807 --> 14:23.934
But he didn't care.

14:24.110 --> 14:28.046
He was ready to kill me and there
wasn't a damn thing l could do about it.

14:32.218 --> 14:36.655
You know, it might not be such
a bad idea to get counseling.

14:36.822 --> 14:38.687
lt really helped Brenda.

14:39.058 --> 14:41.754
Actually, l...

14:41.928 --> 14:44.192
l got something else in mind.

14:55.808 --> 14:58.572
Hey, you're good.

14:58.744 --> 15:01.508
Dodge City, you better be.

15:11.190 --> 15:14.250
Mom, l told you, you cannot park
in the apartment manager's spot.

15:14.427 --> 15:15.485
He told me it was okay.

15:16.929 --> 15:18.328
- Hi, Jackie.
- Hi, Donna.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.364
You're doing David's laundry again?

15:20.533 --> 15:23.058
Why not?
lt's the highlight of my social life.

15:23.236 --> 15:24.965
Oh, and l ordered pizza
for you guys.

15:25.137 --> 15:26.934
One vegetarian
and one with pepperoni.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.501
Well, thank you.

15:29.675 --> 15:30.972
Wow, your mom is so great.

15:31.611 --> 15:33.875
Yeah, you don't have to listen
to her constant complaining

15:34.046 --> 15:38.005
about how miserably lonely she is
and how l never come to visit,

15:38.184 --> 15:40.914
and how awful it is
sharing Erin with Mel.

15:41.087 --> 15:42.418
lt's enough to drive me crazy.

15:42.588 --> 15:43.816
Look who's here.

15:44.457 --> 15:45.947
Hi, baby doll.

15:46.726 --> 15:48.193
Erin, you are so precious.

15:48.361 --> 15:49.919
Well, we're just
one big, happy family.

15:50.263 --> 15:52.697
One big, happy, dysfunctional family.

15:52.865 --> 15:54.856
Don't listen to her.
She's a psych major.

16:00.373 --> 16:03.467
Oh, l understand,
but l'd rather cut myself shaving

16:03.643 --> 16:06.612
than watch the Clippers lose
from the nosebleed section.

16:07.246 --> 16:09.714
But, no, l appreciate you
thinking of me, thanks.

16:09.882 --> 16:11.406
All right, bye-bye.

16:11.584 --> 16:13.814
How you doing?
Cory Randall. You are?

16:13.986 --> 16:17.183
Brandon Walsh. l'm in your class.
Nosebleed section. Seat 1 25.

16:17.657 --> 16:19.090
Great, great. Thanks for coming by.

16:19.258 --> 16:21.818
l wish more of my students would
come by and introduce themselves.

16:21.994 --> 16:24.224
- Why don't you have a seat?
- Thanks.

16:25.231 --> 16:26.926
So l take it you're into sports, huh?

16:27.099 --> 16:30.466
Yeah, why not? By studying them,
l get a lot of free tickets.

16:30.636 --> 16:33.161
l know, l was the sports editor
on my high school newspaper.

16:33.339 --> 16:36.035
Well, good. So you probably know
the origins of the Mendoza Line.

16:36.776 --> 16:40.303
Actually, l ran a check on my computer
last night and came up empty.

16:40.813 --> 16:41.939
Try the sports page.

16:43.015 --> 16:45.575
So, what, are you a little uptight
about this test?

16:45.751 --> 16:46.945
No, not really.

16:47.119 --> 16:49.917
But if you wanna show me
an advance copy, l wouldn't complain.

16:50.089 --> 16:52.489
- Brandon, you read Chapter 2, right?
- Sure.

16:53.092 --> 16:54.719
You're already in the hall of fame.

17:18.217 --> 17:20.946
- Hi there.
- Hi.

17:21.119 --> 17:23.554
ln the market
for a used StairMaster?

17:23.723 --> 17:25.748
Only if it steps two.

17:27.326 --> 17:28.452
l really enjoyed last night.

17:28.928 --> 17:30.793
So l noticed.

17:30.963 --> 17:35.366
Look at this. We could buy
an almost new, king-sized waterbed.

17:41.474 --> 17:43.601
l don't think we should consider
buying common property

17:43.776 --> 17:46.176
when we can't even hold hands
in public.

17:47.046 --> 17:48.638
- Andrea--
- You better turn away from me.

17:48.814 --> 17:51.840
- Somebody might be watching us.
- You're not being fair.

17:52.451 --> 17:53.918
l'm not?

17:54.086 --> 17:56.077
Excuse me, what about you?

17:56.255 --> 17:58.348
Every time l think about us,
l don't understand it.

17:58.524 --> 18:02.358
Why is it we have to hide
behind closed doors?

18:02.528 --> 18:05.622
l mean, are you so ashamed
that you're going out with a freshman?

18:05.798 --> 18:06.822
Of course not.

18:07.233 --> 18:10.100
Well, why is it all we can do
is do it in your room?

18:11.070 --> 18:12.799
Look, it's just...

18:12.972 --> 18:14.735
You know...

18:15.741 --> 18:17.470
People talk.

18:19.678 --> 18:21.942
Look, we can't go on this way.
What are we gonna do?

18:23.449 --> 18:25.542
Brando, l think l actually aced
my first college exam.

18:25.718 --> 18:27.049
Steve, what's the matter with you?

18:27.219 --> 18:28.743
l just asked you
about social structure,

18:28.921 --> 18:30.946
which is what the last section
of the test was on,

18:31.123 --> 18:32.954
and you haven't told me
what your answers were.

18:33.125 --> 18:34.217
l wrote GAlL.

18:34.393 --> 18:35.792
You wrote GAlL? Who's GAlL?

18:35.961 --> 18:39.294
Goals, Adaptation,
lntegration and Law.

18:39.465 --> 18:41.660
- Very good, Steve. l'm impressed.
- You know.

18:41.834 --> 18:43.165
Hey, Dr. Henderberry.

18:43.335 --> 18:47.465
That's what you get
when you take the KEG super cram.

18:49.875 --> 18:51.502
Hey, Silver. What's going on?

18:51.677 --> 18:54.145
Moby Dick, Eight hundred
and twenty-two pages.

18:54.313 --> 18:56.440
lf l can get halfway through it,
l may not get bounced.

18:56.615 --> 18:57.639
You're gonna get bounced.

18:57.817 --> 18:59.808
Don't worry, just take a load off.
The whale did it.

18:59.985 --> 19:01.145
- The whale did it.
- Thanks.

19:01.320 --> 19:02.753
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, John. Hi, Kelly.

19:02.922 --> 19:04.412
Hey, Steve.

19:04.590 --> 19:08.082
Charlie Dixon goes to Leslie Summer
and says, ''Listen, with your blessing,

19:08.260 --> 19:10.160
we'd like this year's
KEG-Alpha homecoming float

19:10.329 --> 19:12.889
to reflect something
a little more relevant.''

19:13.566 --> 19:14.590
So, what are we doing?

19:15.334 --> 19:18.599
A tribute to Velcro
and other household fasteners.

19:20.139 --> 19:21.697
That's good. Who thought of that?

19:21.874 --> 19:23.967
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

19:24.143 --> 19:26.668
- You're a funny guy.
- l'm trying.

19:27.646 --> 19:30.114
So when do l graduate
from phone date to the real thing?

19:31.350 --> 19:33.978
Maybe after midterms, if you're nice.

19:34.153 --> 19:35.848
lf l'm ni--? l'm nice.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.963
l thought you broke up with McKay.

19:50.002 --> 19:52.266
l did. But right now,
l need to talk to him.

19:54.106 --> 19:58.600
Kelly, l'm not just
doing doughnuts here, am l?

19:59.245 --> 20:02.703
You know, spinning my wheels,
chasing my vestigial tail?

20:03.682 --> 20:05.741
You're a funny guy.

20:09.355 --> 20:10.845
Hey.

20:11.023 --> 20:13.617
- How you doing?
- l'm doing.

20:13.792 --> 20:15.987
Well, it's good to see you
back on campus.

20:16.161 --> 20:19.255
And why is it good to see me
back on campus?

20:20.099 --> 20:22.294
Don't do this, Dylan.

20:22.968 --> 20:25.095
l still wanna be part of your life.

20:25.271 --> 20:27.501
Kel, what do you wanna go
and do something like that for?

20:27.673 --> 20:30.141
- My life sucks, and you know it.
- Dylan.

20:30.309 --> 20:31.503
What do you want me to say?

20:32.344 --> 20:34.471
None of this has been easy on me,
l'll tell you that.

20:34.947 --> 20:36.847
But l'm not gonna get myself
in another situation

20:37.016 --> 20:39.416
where some little punk with a big gun
can do a number on me.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.789
l'm about to pop a pie
in the microwave,

20:47.960 --> 20:49.120
if you wanna hang around.

20:49.295 --> 20:52.492
No, thanks, l'll troll for it later.
l gotta hit the books.

20:52.665 --> 20:54.132
What about you, Brenda?

20:54.300 --> 20:56.165
l did my studies this afternoon.

20:56.936 --> 20:59.632
No, l think she meant,
do you want a piece of pie?

21:01.173 --> 21:03.664
No, l can't. l have to go.
Stuart's waiting for me.

21:05.611 --> 21:07.977
Guys, l promised
that l would meet him for coffee.

21:08.147 --> 21:09.205
We won't be late.

21:10.449 --> 21:14.078
Be firm but gentle, Dad.
l think they like each other.

21:14.253 --> 21:16.118
l'm getting that impression.

21:17.156 --> 21:19.283
l mean, what is the crime here?

21:19.458 --> 21:22.359
You set us up. What,
do you want us to hate each other?

21:22.528 --> 21:23.552
No, that's not the point.

21:23.729 --> 21:25.754
This whole thing with Stuart
is going way too fast.

21:25.931 --> 21:28.525
Honey, just give yourselves time
to come up for air.

21:28.701 --> 21:30.862
l mean, you've got other things
going on in your life.

21:31.236 --> 21:32.760
l'm keeping up with everything.

21:32.938 --> 21:34.132
What about him?

21:34.306 --> 21:36.365
Larry Carson
is a pretty demanding boss.

21:36.542 --> 21:39.909
l can't imagine he's too happy about
his son gallivanting around every night.

21:44.917 --> 21:47.647
Hello. Yes, he's right here.

21:50.255 --> 21:54.624
Thank you.
Well, that sounds wonderful.

21:54.793 --> 21:56.124
lt's Larry Carson.

21:56.295 --> 21:59.958
He's inviting us to his place in Bel Air
for brunch on Saturday.

22:01.100 --> 22:02.624
ls he really?

22:02.801 --> 22:06.464
He called it a triple date.

22:12.778 --> 22:15.144
l rest my case.

22:18.517 --> 22:21.918
Okay, folks, read them and weep.
Nice work.

22:22.087 --> 22:25.215
For those of you who did well,
have a nice weekend.

22:25.391 --> 22:28.155
For those of you who did not,
shame on you.

22:28.327 --> 22:31.558
Bro, l got a B. l told you, you should
have joined a fraternity, man.

22:31.730 --> 22:33.721
l will follow my brothers
through the gates of hell.

22:33.899 --> 22:35.696
l love college.

22:35.868 --> 22:37.529
- How'd you do?
- l got an A-plus.

22:37.703 --> 22:39.102
So you did.

22:39.271 --> 22:41.501
What's this?
A note from Professor Randall?

22:41.674 --> 22:44.438
Could you meet me tomorrow
at 1 :30?

22:45.477 --> 22:47.035
A Saturday meeting?

22:47.212 --> 22:49.146
How cozy.

22:49.314 --> 22:52.977
Well, it's obvious you've become
the teacher's pet.

22:54.720 --> 22:56.153
How about
the Santa Monica promenade?

22:56.321 --> 22:57.982
There must be at least
a dozen films there.

22:58.157 --> 23:00.921
No, half the students from our dorm
will be out there cruising.

23:01.093 --> 23:02.424
Hey, what about the Nuart Theatre?

23:02.594 --> 23:04.653
They're showing
a D.H. Lawrence double feature film.

23:06.198 --> 23:07.460
No.

23:07.633 --> 23:09.692
- You don't wanna go see that.
- l didn't say that.

23:09.868 --> 23:12.302
No, but you were thinking
that it's just the kind of movie

23:12.471 --> 23:14.735
people from your department
would wanna go and see.

23:15.474 --> 23:19.171
Look, l came here
because l wanted to ask you out.

23:19.344 --> 23:21.778
On a real date
in front of real people.

23:21.947 --> 23:23.471
But you gotta decide
what we're doing.

23:25.050 --> 23:26.711
l just need...

23:27.386 --> 23:29.980
l just need time to think about this.

23:30.155 --> 23:33.215
l mean, it's not easy going public.
Every place feels so risky.

23:33.392 --> 23:35.690
See? So it's not just me.

23:40.199 --> 23:43.828
We could always do your room.

23:48.207 --> 23:49.731
Did anybody see you come in here?

23:50.209 --> 23:51.676
No.

23:59.685 --> 24:00.811
How are you at Scrabble?

24:05.491 --> 24:06.856
- You want another bite?
- No.

24:07.025 --> 24:09.550
No? You don't want another bite?

24:09.728 --> 24:12.094
- Look over here, silly.
- l think she's had enough.

24:12.264 --> 24:14.630
Well, l just like to make sure
she's well-fed,

24:14.800 --> 24:17.098
because who knows what goes
into her after Mel takes her.

24:17.503 --> 24:20.199
Well, l'll clean her up
because Mel should be here any time.

24:20.372 --> 24:24.206
Thanks, honey. l want her ready
and me long gone before he gets here.

24:24.610 --> 24:25.975
Dylan's on his way over too.

24:26.512 --> 24:28.002
You're kidding?
You guys are back on?

24:28.180 --> 24:31.206
Well, l said to him,
''l still wanna be part of your life.''

24:31.383 --> 24:34.216
And today, he called me up
and he asked me to go out on a date,

24:34.386 --> 24:35.410
to the gun range.

24:35.587 --> 24:37.145
Oh, how romantic.

24:37.322 --> 24:38.846
What was l supposed to say?

24:39.024 --> 24:41.754
According to Chapter 4
of my psych book,

24:41.927 --> 24:45.124
you're going through
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

24:45.297 --> 24:46.594
Well, you just be careful there.

24:46.765 --> 24:49.029
l will. l'm just going to keep
him company.

24:49.201 --> 24:50.225
That must be him.

24:51.503 --> 24:53.198
l'll get it.

24:53.806 --> 24:55.603
Hi, Dave. Donna, you look great.

24:55.774 --> 24:58.709
- Thanks, Mel.
- Hey, Dad. Hi, Nina.

24:58.877 --> 25:00.572
Who's Nina?

25:03.549 --> 25:05.847
You working out or something?
You look big, nice and buff.

25:06.018 --> 25:09.419
Well, it's Nina's doing.
She's a fitness fanatic.

25:09.588 --> 25:12.819
- Where's my little darling?
- l assume you don't mean me.

25:14.626 --> 25:16.560
l'm sorry,
l didn't think you'd still be here.

25:17.896 --> 25:21.491
- Nina, this is Jackie, Erin's mother.
- And don't you forget it.

25:22.568 --> 25:24.559
Jackie, you're just
making this worse than it is.

25:24.736 --> 25:26.431
Oh, l am, huh? Well, tough.

25:26.605 --> 25:30.735
Have a nice weekend.
You certainly started mine out right.

25:34.813 --> 25:36.838
Your mother just won't let us
get on with our lives.

25:37.816 --> 25:39.147
Can you blame her?

25:39.318 --> 25:41.081
How could you
bring your girlfriend here, Mel?

25:45.390 --> 25:48.291
- l can't win.
- Yeah.

25:54.233 --> 25:56.292
Kelly, they were gonna meet
sooner or later.

25:56.468 --> 25:58.402
You are just
as bad as your father, aren't you?

25:58.570 --> 26:00.367
Well, you're just
as neurotic as your mother.

26:00.539 --> 26:01.733
Excuse me, can l say something?

26:01.907 --> 26:03.465
- No.
- No.

26:06.078 --> 26:07.375
Fine.

26:22.227 --> 26:24.889
All right, your turn.

26:25.063 --> 26:26.655
Sorry, you know l'm for gun control.

26:26.832 --> 26:29.198
Yeah, well if you wanna
control your gun, use both hands.

26:29.368 --> 26:31.097
Come on, you'd be a fool
not to learn this.

26:31.270 --> 26:32.737
Dylan, don't call me that.

26:32.905 --> 26:35.203
Kelly, there are 2 million handguns
in Los Angeles alone.

26:35.374 --> 26:37.137
How soon before one of them
is pointed at you?

26:37.309 --> 26:40.107
Now, come on, do one clip.
lt won't kill you.

26:40.279 --> 26:43.612
There you go. Get it like that.

26:43.782 --> 26:45.807
Square yourself up
to the target like l did.

26:45.984 --> 26:48.452
Now, just aim
and squeeze the trigger.

26:48.620 --> 26:49.746
lt's gonna be loud, isn't it?

26:49.922 --> 26:53.414
Yeah, but just expect it.
The first one's always the worst.

26:54.559 --> 26:55.719
Where do l aim?

26:55.894 --> 26:58.328
Hit the target. Go for the center.

27:00.265 --> 27:01.926
l can't do this.

27:02.501 --> 27:04.366
Hey, what do you want?
You wanna be a statistic?

27:04.536 --> 27:05.867
You wanna be a victim?

27:06.038 --> 27:08.438
l mean, Kelly, the writing
is spray painted on the wall.

27:08.607 --> 27:11.542
You got as much a chance of taking
a bullet as being in a car accident.

27:11.910 --> 27:13.605
Am l not supposed
to worry about that?

27:13.779 --> 27:15.610
lt's not my problem,
let other people worry?

27:15.781 --> 27:17.408
l'm worried about you.

27:17.582 --> 27:20.551
Don't be.
l'm getting pretty good at this.

27:55.053 --> 27:56.884
What's wrong with you?

27:57.055 --> 27:58.920
l'm just scared.

27:59.091 --> 28:00.115
l'm scared.

28:00.292 --> 28:02.055
That's why l'm learning
to protect myself.

28:02.227 --> 28:03.922
Can't we just get out of here,
please?

28:04.096 --> 28:06.223
Haven't you been listening
to anything l've said?

28:06.398 --> 28:07.524
What do you want me to say?

28:07.699 --> 28:09.599
lt's a violent world out there
and nobody's safe.

28:09.801 --> 28:11.462
l didn't make the rules,
but no one's safe.

28:11.636 --> 28:13.797
Not you, not me, nobody.

28:41.133 --> 28:42.691
Thank you.

28:43.468 --> 28:47.029
Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. Walsh.
The Carsons are by the pool.

28:47.205 --> 28:49.537
lf you'll just follow the path
through the garden.

28:49.708 --> 28:51.198
Thank you.

29:01.853 --> 29:03.912
Where have you guys been?
We've been waiting for you.

29:04.089 --> 29:05.556
We thought you lost track of time.

29:05.724 --> 29:07.351
- Are we late?
- No, you're not late.

29:07.526 --> 29:08.925
You're as punctual as ever.

29:09.094 --> 29:11.562
Brenda, stop giving your father
a hard time.

29:11.730 --> 29:12.754
How you doing, Jim?

29:12.931 --> 29:16.059
Terrific, Larry.
Your house is overwhelming.

29:16.234 --> 29:18.828
Well, thank you. We like it.

29:19.004 --> 29:21.700
- You must be Cindy.
- Hi, very nice to meet you.

29:21.873 --> 29:24.364
Nice to meet you too.
And this is my wife, Vivian.

29:24.543 --> 29:26.135
Hello, Vivian.

29:26.311 --> 29:29.371
Oh, are these for me?
They're beautiful.

29:29.714 --> 29:31.545
Your gardens are beautiful.

29:31.716 --> 29:34.583
l have never seen
so many Oceana roses.

29:35.387 --> 29:38.254
We're going to get along fabulously.

29:38.857 --> 29:39.881
Stuart.

29:40.058 --> 29:42.185
Stuart, get your rude self
out of the pool right now

29:42.360 --> 29:44.521
and come and say hi
to the Walshes.

29:52.904 --> 29:57.341
- Well, at least he didn't call me Stu.
- Hey, relax. lt's only my parents.

29:57.642 --> 29:59.507
- Hi, how you doing?
- Hi.

29:59.678 --> 30:01.475
Just let me dry off.

30:01.880 --> 30:04.940
- This is going to be a long afternoon.
- lt sure is.

30:05.117 --> 30:06.584
Hey--

30:10.589 --> 30:12.250
Mom, you don't have to apologize.

30:12.424 --> 30:14.358
l'm just so ashamed,
walking out like l did.

30:14.526 --> 30:15.891
l didn't even say goodbye to Erin.

30:16.061 --> 30:18.996
- I miss her so much,
- Well, you'll see her Sunday night.

30:19.664 --> 30:21.188
l hate the weekends.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.230
Mom, it's gonna be all right, okay?

30:24.402 --> 30:26.597
- Andrea.
- Hey, gents.

30:26.771 --> 30:28.762
- Kelly's looking for you.
- That's why we're here.

30:28.940 --> 30:30.635
What's going on?
We haven't seen you around.

30:31.009 --> 30:32.237
l've been involved.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.435
- lnvolved? lnvolved is good.
- lnvolved is good.

30:34.613 --> 30:36.137
Yeah, involved is good.

30:36.648 --> 30:41.517
But l feel like l'm trying to get
into an ice-cold pool step by step.

30:41.686 --> 30:44.314
l know l'm gonna love it,
it's just the getting there that's agony.

30:44.489 --> 30:47.253
Well, call me a guy,
but in situations like this,

30:47.425 --> 30:48.949
l usually opt for the old cannonball.

30:49.127 --> 30:52.563
The flying cannonball.
lnto the deep end, preferably naked.

30:52.731 --> 30:55.359
- Naked is good.
- l'll take that into consideration.

30:55.534 --> 30:57.434
- Just remember, naked is good.
- Naked is good.

30:58.236 --> 31:00.170
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Kel. What's going on?

31:00.338 --> 31:02.272
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem, what's up?

31:02.440 --> 31:06.001
Dylan. He's acting very scary.

31:06.178 --> 31:07.577
l'm sure he's gonna be fine, Kel.

31:07.946 --> 31:10.938
Not if he's spending all of his time
at a target range shooting guns.

31:11.950 --> 31:12.974
ls that what he's doing?

31:13.985 --> 31:15.577
Believe me, Steve, it's not wow.

31:15.754 --> 31:18.245
lt's like ever since the carjacking,
he's gone gun-crazy.

31:18.423 --> 31:20.288
l wouldn't be surprised
if he's bought one.

31:20.458 --> 31:21.857
Listen, Kel, l grew up hunting.

31:22.027 --> 31:24.393
Owning a gun
is not the worst thing a guy can do.

31:24.563 --> 31:25.996
Besides, it's just a fact of life,

31:26.164 --> 31:28.758
ever since the riots, people in L.A.
have been arming themselves.

31:29.534 --> 31:32.731
Yeah, l get it.
Because this is the Wild West?

31:32.904 --> 31:35.998
lt's the good guys and the bad guys
killing each other every day, right?

31:36.775 --> 31:39.300
- l wouldn't go that far.
- Well, maybe Dylan would.

31:39.811 --> 31:41.711
Guys, he's acting
like he's Rambo or something.

31:41.880 --> 31:46.078
When he shaves his head and starts
talking to the mirror, then we'll worry.

31:46.251 --> 31:48.219
Brandon, you've seen him,
he is not in a good way.

31:48.386 --> 31:50.149
l'll admit it,
he's had some bad moments.

31:50.322 --> 31:51.687
Bad moments?

31:51.856 --> 31:54.950
l haven't seen him this angry,
including when his father died.

31:55.126 --> 31:58.118
l mean, l'm just afraid that he's gonna
hurt himself or somebody else.

31:59.731 --> 32:02.825
All right, assuming you're right,
what do you want us to do about it?

32:03.768 --> 32:06.464
Just go over there.
Talk to him, see for yourself.

32:06.638 --> 32:08.538
Because he sure
will not listen to me.

32:15.013 --> 32:17.038
l've gotta go to campus
and talk to this professor.

32:17.215 --> 32:19.308
- But we'll get with him today.
- Yeah.

32:20.085 --> 32:22.417
- Thanks.
- He's our friend too.

32:28.393 --> 32:29.917
Here you are.

32:34.966 --> 32:36.831
Am l the only one
having seconds around here?

32:37.002 --> 32:38.299
That would be thirds, Dad.

32:38.470 --> 32:40.062
Jim, l hate to talk business,

32:40.238 --> 32:43.071
but since l have you here,
l hope you don't mind taking a look

32:43.241 --> 32:46.404
at the preliminary numbers
on this Plano project.

32:46.578 --> 32:48.068
Well, l think this is my cue to exit.

32:48.413 --> 32:53.146
Hey, Stuart,
this mall project involves you too.

32:53.318 --> 32:54.751
During the week it does.

32:54.919 --> 32:58.082
But right now, if you don't mind,
the kids would like to be excused.

32:58.256 --> 32:59.689
Brenda, would you tell him

32:59.858 --> 33:03.316
that with his attitude,
he's never gonna amount to much?

33:03.495 --> 33:06.953
Stuart, with your attitude, you're--
What was that again, Larry?

33:08.266 --> 33:09.790
Go on, get out of here.

33:13.271 --> 33:17.230
Oh, they are so cute together.

33:24.015 --> 33:26.108
- Hey, thanks for coming down.
- You bet.

33:26.284 --> 33:28.684
Believe me, l wouldn't have
brought you down here on Saturday

33:28.853 --> 33:30.184
if it wasn't a front-burner issue.

33:30.355 --> 33:31.549
Not a problem. What's going on?

33:31.723 --> 33:33.554
Well, it's about
one of your classmates.

33:33.725 --> 33:35.090
His name is D'Shawn Hardell.

33:35.260 --> 33:37.558
Although, really,
he just likes the letter D on his jersey.

33:37.729 --> 33:40.197
Right, right, l read about this kid.
Hot prospect from Texas,

33:40.365 --> 33:42.333
just transferred here from some JC.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.197
Yeah, unfortunately his academic
game isn't what it should be.

33:46.371 --> 33:48.305
To say that this guy
needs a little coaching

33:48.473 --> 33:51.101
would be an extreme
understatement.

33:51.276 --> 33:52.470
So you want me to tutor him?

33:52.644 --> 33:55.010
Well, l'm interviewing
five students for the job.

33:55.180 --> 33:56.306
Look, from your test,

33:56.481 --> 33:58.574
obviously you've got a firm grasp
of the fundamentals

33:58.750 --> 34:00.547
and l know
you're a fellow sports pig,

34:00.719 --> 34:02.414
so that makes you
a candidate for the job.

34:02.587 --> 34:03.611
Cool.

34:03.788 --> 34:06.222
l should tell you something.
D'Shawn's not dumb.

34:06.391 --> 34:09.882
He's got it in him to be a fine student.
He's just not motivated.

34:10.061 --> 34:11.960
- So it could be a struggle.
- l'm game.

34:12.130 --> 34:13.927
And there's gonna be
a little pressure too.

34:14.099 --> 34:15.929
lf he's gonna be eligible
to walk on the court,

34:16.101 --> 34:17.931
he's gotta get
at least a C in my class.

34:18.737 --> 34:21.170
- The Mendoza Line.
- That's right.

34:21.339 --> 34:24.331
Named after Mario Mendoza,
a bad-bat, good-glove infielder

34:24.509 --> 34:26.670
whose lifetime batting average
was 200.

34:26.844 --> 34:29.643
A statistical measure
for major-league competence.

34:30.514 --> 34:33.245
lf you don't mind,
l'll just cancel the other interviews.

34:34.119 --> 34:36.110
- You mean l got the job?
- Slam dunk.

34:36.286 --> 34:38.755
All right. Thanks.

34:43.293 --> 34:45.319
Okay.

34:57.642 --> 34:58.802
Great shot.

34:59.644 --> 35:02.135
Pinball's one of the few things
l'm really good at.

35:02.313 --> 35:04.304
At least, according to my father.

35:04.482 --> 35:07.246
Well, it must be very hard
to try and live up to his expectations.

35:08.286 --> 35:10.516
l gave that up a long time ago.

35:10.688 --> 35:13.418
l just let my dad write me off
as the idiot child.

35:13.591 --> 35:15.616
Well, that's his loss.

35:15.794 --> 35:17.887
But l must be maturing,
because for the first time,

35:18.062 --> 35:21.998
l'm really enjoying
being back in the family fold.

35:23.468 --> 35:24.628
l think you helped.

35:25.870 --> 35:27.394
A lot.

35:27.872 --> 35:31.638
Well, like l said,
l have that effect on depressive types.

35:33.445 --> 35:36.278
Hold on, hold on.
My parents are just outside.

35:36.448 --> 35:38.814
Oh, so now the shoe's
on the other foot?

35:38.983 --> 35:40.610
Well, l don't care. Let them find out.

35:40.785 --> 35:42.912
l love--

36:05.810 --> 36:08.301
Hey, is this where the party's at?

36:15.453 --> 36:18.650
Hey, either one of you guys
D'Shawn Hardell?

36:19.591 --> 36:20.888
- Who's asking?
- Brandon Walsh.

36:21.059 --> 36:23.152
Professor Randall told me
l could meet him here.

36:23.328 --> 36:24.761
Oh, yeah, man. You're my tutor.

36:24.929 --> 36:26.487
- That's me.
- Sweet.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.725
- How much they paying you?
- Not as much as they're paying you.

36:34.672 --> 36:36.139
That's cold.

36:36.307 --> 36:39.208
And l could have had a lot better deal
at Arizona State, you understand?

36:39.377 --> 36:42.505
But it was a numbers thing,
and l was man out.

36:42.680 --> 36:44.375
So now...

36:47.719 --> 36:48.743
l'm a Condor.

36:56.594 --> 36:58.186
Hey, right on the glass.

36:59.297 --> 37:00.389
Yeah.

37:00.565 --> 37:02.658
- Hardell.
- Hey, call me D'Shawn, coz.

37:03.067 --> 37:04.500
D'Shawn, we gotta hit the books,
man.

37:04.669 --> 37:07.331
Randall wants us to jump right in
and get ready for Monday's class.

37:07.505 --> 37:09.769
Don't hold the ball. Shoot it.

37:10.942 --> 37:12.569
Come on, man,
we've got studying to do.

37:12.744 --> 37:15.144
- The ball.
- Go on, now.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.107
Only if you can make that shot.

37:27.725 --> 37:28.851
You got it, man.

37:29.027 --> 37:32.258
He's hard. Brandon is hard.

37:32.430 --> 37:34.591
Let's go, two on two.
l'll take my tutor.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.195
- Think fast.
- Bingo, come on now.

37:37.735 --> 37:39.794
Come on, give it up.

37:44.208 --> 37:46.267
Donna, did Dylan call for me?

37:47.278 --> 37:48.643
Great, Kelly's home.

37:49.347 --> 37:51.907
No, only John Sears.

37:52.584 --> 37:53.846
Look, she's gonna notice Erin,

37:54.018 --> 37:57.579
so just be up-front
and lose the attitude.

38:00.291 --> 38:01.724
Come on.

38:02.627 --> 38:04.151
Heave-ho.

38:08.866 --> 38:12.165
Hi, Kelly. Say hi to Kelly, Erin.

38:12.337 --> 38:15.238
- You're babysitting?
- Well, it's just for the afternoon.

38:15.707 --> 38:17.231
This is incredible.

38:17.408 --> 38:19.137
Mel strikes again, huh?
He dumped her on you.

38:19.510 --> 38:21.842
Look, just yell all you want
and get it over with, okay?

38:22.013 --> 38:24.106
Yeah, l will.
Because l think your father is sick.

38:24.282 --> 38:25.943
Your mom's a space case
half the time.

38:26.117 --> 38:28.483
- At least she's trying, David.
- Yeah, well, so is he.

38:28.653 --> 38:29.915
You guys, please.

38:31.322 --> 38:33.984
- She started it.
- Oh, yeah, l started it.

38:34.158 --> 38:38.424
Now, neither of you started it.
This is your parents' war, not yours.

38:48.706 --> 38:52.369
- She's right.
- Yeah.

38:52.543 --> 38:53.976
l think that for Erin's sake,

38:54.145 --> 38:58.013
we need to both remember
not to fight our parents' battles.

38:59.017 --> 39:00.314
All right.

39:01.252 --> 39:02.742
That's better.

39:11.696 --> 39:13.721
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:13.898 --> 39:17.061
Your note said to meet you
in the Union for a date.

39:17.635 --> 39:20.103
So here l am.

39:20.271 --> 39:22.102
Good boy.

39:22.273 --> 39:24.935
Where we going? Oxnard?

39:25.443 --> 39:27.911
No, right here.

39:28.446 --> 39:29.845
No.

39:30.648 --> 39:32.639
Not quite here.

39:38.856 --> 39:45.489
Would you say that
this is the exact center of the room?

39:47.732 --> 39:50.360
lt appears to be, yes.

39:52.070 --> 39:54.061
What kind of date is this?

39:54.238 --> 39:58.231
Just say, it is my version
of a flying cannonball.

40:16.928 --> 40:19.055
l just don't think
we're gonna be able to defer, Larry.

40:19.230 --> 40:20.891
l'm gonna have to run
those numbers again.

40:22.433 --> 40:25.960
Larry, are you still hounding
this poor man?

40:26.137 --> 40:28.765
They're ready to leave
and we're going out tonight.

40:28.940 --> 40:31.306
Okay, the boss has spoken.

40:31.476 --> 40:33.273
Now we just have to find Brenda.

40:33.444 --> 40:37.005
Well, l understand that she and Stuart
are going out tonight too.

40:37.181 --> 40:38.876
Again?

40:39.050 --> 40:41.211
Listen, l gotta tell you,

40:41.385 --> 40:45.549
l think that Brenda is the best thing
that ever happened to my son.

40:45.723 --> 40:50.183
- She is. She really is.
- But every night?

40:50.361 --> 40:52.386
Don't think they're burning
the candle at both ends?

40:52.563 --> 40:55.794
Are you kidding?
l wish l had all that energy.

40:55.967 --> 40:58.026
Listen, you sit. l'll go find the kids.

40:58.202 --> 40:59.533
Thanks.

41:00.238 --> 41:01.432
Would you like some coffee?

41:02.774 --> 41:03.934
Coffee, please.

41:06.677 --> 41:08.201
Stuart?

41:10.248 --> 41:11.772
Stuart?

41:13.117 --> 41:14.141
Hey.

41:14.318 --> 41:16.286
Where's Brenda?
The Walshes are leaving.

41:16.454 --> 41:18.684
Well, she's taking a shower, Dad.

41:19.190 --> 41:22.523
- Dad, l am over 21 .
- But she's not.

41:22.693 --> 41:24.923
Hey, show a little respect.

41:25.096 --> 41:27.189
Now, get yourselves
discreetly downstairs

41:27.365 --> 41:28.559
and you can take her home.

41:29.133 --> 41:30.157
Why? We're going out.

41:30.334 --> 41:32.165
Not tonight.
Her parents want her to stay in.

41:32.336 --> 41:33.530
Dad, l have tickets.

41:34.138 --> 41:38.598
Hey, you guys have
the rest of your lives to be together.

41:38.776 --> 41:40.266
Stuart--

41:41.646 --> 41:43.079
Mr. Carson.

41:44.048 --> 41:45.948
Hello, honey.

41:46.117 --> 41:47.982
Oh, my God.

41:48.719 --> 41:52.621
Stuart, next time,
get her to use the pool house.

41:52.790 --> 41:57.386
l don't think her father
is as tolerant as l am, huh?

42:14.212 --> 42:17.079
- Fellas, what's happening?
- Looking for you, baby.

42:17.248 --> 42:19.409
Glad you made it. Otherwise,
we'd eat this by ourselves.

42:19.584 --> 42:21.211
- No chance.
- What's with the Jeep?

42:21.385 --> 42:22.409
Turning over a new leaf?

42:22.587 --> 42:25.055
No, it's just a rental
till Manny gets the Speedster going.

42:25.223 --> 42:26.690
Come on in.

42:28.793 --> 42:30.852
Watch it, man, the cheese.

42:32.797 --> 42:34.264
So, gentlemen, what is happening?

42:34.432 --> 42:36.093
Nothing, man.
How were the waves?

42:36.267 --> 42:37.291
They were about 3-foot.

42:37.468 --> 42:39.368
Excellent sets, though.
Nice breaker to the left.

42:39.537 --> 42:42.131
From out there,
the city seems almost mellow.

42:42.306 --> 42:43.330
l can almost imagine that.

42:43.507 --> 42:46.305
Yeah, the problem is, eventually,
you gotta paddle back in, so...

42:46.477 --> 42:48.536
- You look a lot better, man.
- Yeah, l feel better.

42:48.713 --> 42:50.977
ln fact, l was thinking
of taking some classes on Monday.

42:51.148 --> 42:53.981
l heard you've been spending time
at the gun range popping off caps.

42:54.151 --> 42:55.618
Yeah.

42:55.920 --> 42:59.321
Let me guess. Kelly asked you to come
over here and talk to me, right?

42:59.490 --> 43:00.957
She's just concerned, that's all.

43:01.125 --> 43:03.855
She thinks you've gone Waco, man.

43:04.028 --> 43:05.928
She thinks
you're stockpiling firepower here.

43:06.097 --> 43:07.792
Guys, she's overreacting.

43:07.965 --> 43:11.560
l mean, come on, she's feeling guilty,
and l think we all know why.

43:11.736 --> 43:13.863
l'll get the plates,
you guys grab the drinks.

43:14.038 --> 43:15.630
Sounds good.

43:21.445 --> 43:25.814
A Walther PPK 9 mm kurtz.
Excellent weapon.

43:25.983 --> 43:29.146
Stopping power, size, elegance.

43:30.388 --> 43:32.447
Fourteen in the clip, one in the pipe.

43:32.623 --> 43:36.559
l tried other guns,
but really, it was a no-brainer.

43:36.727 --> 43:38.490
That's very unique.

43:39.397 --> 43:42.025
Denny from the target range
says you're a damn good shot.

43:43.034 --> 43:45.559
Hold on, Mr. McKay.

43:46.370 --> 43:47.735
Denny never told me your age.

43:47.905 --> 43:50.840
Unless you're over 21 ,
l'm afraid l can't sell you a handgun.

43:51.008 --> 43:52.032
Sorry, that's law.

43:52.209 --> 43:54.200
Wait, you're telling me
l can't buy peace of mind?

43:54.378 --> 43:55.402
How about a shotgun?

43:55.579 --> 43:57.638
Don't think it'll fit
in my glove compartment.

43:57.815 --> 44:00.784
Listen, this city's full of 1 5-year-olds
with MAC-1 0 street sweepers.

44:00.952 --> 44:02.749
l don't think anybody
is checking their lD.

44:02.920 --> 44:05.115
Hey, believe me,
l sympathize with your situation,

44:05.289 --> 44:06.984
but l can't help you.

44:12.596 --> 44:14.359
At least, not here.

44:14.532 --> 44:18.366
But after hours, there are a lot of guys
who can get you anything you want.

44:21.973 --> 44:23.531
Okay.

44:24.475 --> 44:25.635
l'll see you after hours.
