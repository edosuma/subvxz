09:22.395 --> 09:24.314
on a mission from King Chocolate...

09:24.397 --> 09:27.817
...who's here to meet with a spy
from the Peanut Butter Forest?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.986
And then their briefcases get mixed up...

09:30.070 --> 09:31.154
Ho-ho,

09:31.237 --> 09:33.198
watch out, candy lovers!

09:33.281 --> 09:34.365
[Kimmy] Watch out is right!

09:34.449 --> 09:36.534
Why did you say, like,
only parts of that sentence?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.328
You know I can't hear
your backpack, right?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.288
Okay, that's not "just a guy."

09:40.371 --> 09:42.123
What do you think their story is?

09:42.624 --> 09:45.919
I believe that white nonsense
is either Judaism or... Scrabble.

09:46.002 --> 09:46.836
[man] Hey,

09:46.920 --> 09:49.255
FYI, this is where we usually set up
our Quidditch hoop.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.257
Don't wanna catch a Quaffle
in your muggle gut,

09:51.341 --> 09:52.425
let alone a Bludger.

09:52.509 --> 09:53.551
I don't overstand.

09:53.635 --> 09:55.512
It's Quidditch.
The sport from <i>Harry Potter</i> ?

09:56.471 --> 09:59.849
The most important book series
of my childhood and current-hood?

10:02.227 --> 10:04.229
You know, Quidditch? The Golden Snitch?

10:04.312 --> 10:06.022
Buzz, buzz! Flap, flap, flap!

10:06.106 --> 10:08.733
I'm so sneaky right now!

10:09.400 --> 10:10.777
This is a <i>book.</i>

10:11.569 --> 10:13.905
And these guys liked it so much
when they were boys

10:13.988 --> 10:15.824
that they're still doing <i>this...</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:17.158
in public.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.618
I'm a seeker for the 'Claw.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.454
If a book can do that,

10:21.538 --> 10:23.456
imagine if it has a positive message

10:23.540 --> 10:25.375
about how boys should treat girls.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.502
And there's dragons and monsters!

10:27.585 --> 10:29.254
And the monsters live inside them

10:29.337 --> 10:30.296
and try to trick them!

10:30.380 --> 10:32.340
[Jan] And it's all on a planet called...

10:32.423 --> 10:34.551
- [both] Greenmulax!
- We should be writing this down!

10:34.634 --> 10:38.805
Well, get a pen from inside me! [giggling]

10:38.888 --> 10:40.849
Random House wants me to write a book?

10:40.932 --> 10:43.893
Well, I hope they like books...
'cause I'm writing one...

10:43.977 --> 10:45.186
- for them!
- [Jan] Ah!

10:45.270 --> 10:47.313
They're gonna love it!

10:48.606 --> 10:49.482
Pass.

10:49.566 --> 10:50.733
Wait, what?

10:50.817 --> 10:52.277
Are you judging it by its cover?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.862
'Cause that's just my contact info.

10:53.945 --> 10:55.530
For the actual cover, I was thinking...

10:55.613 --> 10:57.407
is Lisa Frank still alive?

10:58.408 --> 11:00.451
You wrote a young adult fantasy?

11:00.535 --> 11:04.164
I was working all night on it
with only two <i>Designing Women </i> breaks.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.833
And it's got a real good message for boys.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.877
See, there's a little monster inside you,

11:08.960 --> 11:10.920
and most of the time, you're friends,

11:11.004 --> 11:13.590
but when it gets mad or hungry

11:13.673 --> 11:16.843
or thinks it deserves something
that belongs to someone else,

11:16.926 --> 11:18.761
it tries to take over your body--

11:18.845 --> 11:20.263
Kimmy. No.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.973
See, <i>this</i>

11:22.056 --> 11:23.725
is what we want from you.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.059
People see you as a Mole Woman,

11:25.143 --> 11:27.437
and it's my job to keep you in that box.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.939
No! I've <i>been </i> put in a box.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.901
Yes! Yeah, see, that--
that is the kind of stuff we need.

11:33.276 --> 11:34.235
This is a business,

11:34.319 --> 11:36.487
and nobody's ever gonna buy
your children's book.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.908
I'm sorry.
I'm just living in the real world.

11:41.743 --> 11:44.245
Well,
I guess I finally found out what happens

11:44.329 --> 11:45.997
when people stop being polite

11:46.080 --> 11:47.749
and start getting real.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.000
True story!

11:51.000 --> 11:57.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

12:00.595 --> 12:02.096
[Lillian] Hang on.

12:02.180 --> 12:03.389
It's over?

12:03.473 --> 12:04.557
Oh, my God.

12:04.641 --> 12:07.393
Lillian, did I give you the wrong time?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.228
Agh! And Richard Kind

12:09.312 --> 12:11.022
gave such a beautiful reading

12:11.105 --> 12:12.941
of the menu from Sammy's Roumanian.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.151
I don't think so.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.569
Your story's like

12:16.653 --> 12:18.529
bras and toothpaste,

12:18.613 --> 12:20.073
'cause I ain't buying it!

12:23.076 --> 12:24.035
What was it?

12:24.994 --> 12:26.120
The coke necklace?

12:26.204 --> 12:28.164
Well, to start with.

12:28.247 --> 12:31.626
I mean, those are just symbols
from <i>Led Zeppelin IV.</i>

12:33.002 --> 12:36.506
And your brother seemed
awfully suspicious to see you

12:36.589 --> 12:38.800
acting like a grown-up.

12:39.384 --> 12:40.343
And, kiddo,

12:41.177 --> 12:43.638
I know a rat-trap bruise

12:43.721 --> 12:45.264
when I see one.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.308
I wanted that cheese, man.

12:47.392 --> 12:48.393
So, what, you're just

12:48.476 --> 12:49.560
the black sheep

12:49.644 --> 12:52.438
trying to hold it together for the family,

12:52.522 --> 12:53.773
but then I show up--

12:53.856 --> 12:56.067
And I could tell that you were onto me,

12:56.150 --> 12:58.277
so I gave you the wrong time

12:58.361 --> 13:00.321
because I don't need that noise.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.239
So...

13:02.198 --> 13:04.450
it's all about the Tubmans.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.702
That's right.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.537
I updated it!

13:07.620 --> 13:09.622
Time's up, Benjamins!

13:09.706 --> 13:13.835
My trust fund was completely
controlled by my father.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.461
Anytime I wanted cash,

13:15.545 --> 13:17.547
I had to go beg Daddy

13:17.630 --> 13:19.924
for business ideas or mail-order grooms

13:20.008 --> 13:21.050
or racing donkeys!

13:22.010 --> 13:23.553
It's the future of sports!

13:24.137 --> 13:26.264
But after they read that will tonight...

13:26.347 --> 13:29.642
Your brother is gonna be in control
of your money!

13:29.726 --> 13:31.269
And if he thinks--

13:31.352 --> 13:33.521
"Sheba's so responsible now!

13:33.604 --> 13:36.566
She's got a watch!
She's clearly showered!"

13:37.150 --> 13:39.861
He's gonna give <i>me </i> control.

13:39.944 --> 13:40.987
And I'm gonna open

13:41.070 --> 13:43.573
a year-round Halloween store.

13:43.656 --> 13:47.035
[scoffs] It's 12 times the profits,
idiots.

13:47.118 --> 13:48.494
I'm not gonna let that happen.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.122
I'm gonna find Ethan
and I'm gonna tell him

13:51.205 --> 13:53.207
exactly what you're up to.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.334
And if you think that I'm gonna give up,

13:55.418 --> 13:58.713
then you have not seen me
try to change a light bulb alone!

13:59.797 --> 14:01.424
And I'm Polish.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.509
[cackles]

14:03.593 --> 14:07.638
[mischievous music playing]

14:08.514 --> 14:11.184
Yes! You're a genius, me.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.227
"Then, The Capist turns to Honk Shoe."

14:13.978 --> 14:16.147
Wait. "Honk Shoe"?

14:16.230 --> 14:17.523
[snoring] Honk...

14:18.274 --> 14:19.233
Shoe.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.111
Honk... [snores]

14:22.195 --> 14:23.738
Shoe...

14:23.821 --> 14:24.822
Honk Shoe?

14:25.490 --> 14:26.532
[gasps]

14:26.616 --> 14:28.076
Kimmy, I have nothing!

14:28.159 --> 14:29.869
And my meeting is in less than an hour.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.038
I mean, 20 minutes.
Why would I say it that way?

14:32.121 --> 14:34.665
Well, I'd give you all of my ideas,
but I know for a fact

14:34.749 --> 14:36.292
that no one wants them.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.502
Wait.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.711
That's perfect.

14:38.795 --> 14:40.546
I need something so I can get paid,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.006
and if they actually wanna buy it,

14:42.090 --> 14:43.674
I'd have to write. That's not happening.

14:44.133 --> 14:46.552
Now that I know it's not sexual,
I don't want a back nine.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.471
Well, <i>mi casa es su casa.</i>

14:49.263 --> 14:51.391
- Does that mean "take my book"?
- Yes.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.184
Try not to laugh.

14:53.267 --> 14:56.354
I guess it was written by a baby
who doesn't understand the world.

14:56.437 --> 14:57.730
[gasps]

14:57.814 --> 14:58.940
Kimmy, this is so bad.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.317
But so sincere.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.568
[inhales sharply] Gross.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.904
Thank you.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.663
[Kimmy] Jan...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.623
Jan, we need to talk.

15:15.706 --> 15:18.376
Yeah. What should we do know?
Pretend to be giraffes?

15:18.459 --> 15:20.294
What noise does a giraffe make?

15:20.378 --> 15:21.796
Gira-a-a-affe!

15:21.879 --> 15:23.798
Giraffes don't make any noise, Jan.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.717
- I learned that in college.
- Oh. Um...

15:27.301 --> 15:29.512
[croaking quietly] gira-a-a... gira-a-a...

15:29.595 --> 15:32.849
Look, in the bunker,
I needed to escape reality,

15:32.932 --> 15:35.101
but now I'm trying to face reality.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.270
I'm a grown-up now.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.106
Your straps have probably
noticed my boobs.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.024
But grown-ups don't just wake up one day

15:42.108 --> 15:45.153
and decide they'll write a book
that's gonna fix everything.

15:45.236 --> 15:48.531
If I want to change the world,
I've gotta start by changing myself.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.367
[brightly] As long as I'm around,
I'll never let that happen!

15:51.909 --> 15:52.994
[sighs]

15:53.494 --> 15:55.997
I've already changed, Jan. A lot.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.875
I buy clothes at the same place
as anthropologists.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.626
I have a debit card and a job,

16:00.710 --> 16:02.503
where I'm partially vested.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.506
When I'm fully vested, I'll have a vest.

16:05.590 --> 16:09.385
Vests are fun 'cause your sleeves
don't get in your pudding.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.305
It's just, if I'm ever gonna really
be a grown-up,

16:12.388 --> 16:14.223
if I'm ever gonna actually do something,

16:14.307 --> 16:16.976
I've gotta get rid of the stuff
that's holding me back.

16:17.059 --> 16:19.061
Um... "stuff"?

16:19.645 --> 16:20.813
Like what?

16:20.897 --> 16:22.273
Like...

16:22.356 --> 16:24.192
my Hello Kitty sheets

16:24.275 --> 16:26.652
and my day-of-the-week underwear...

16:26.736 --> 16:28.905
and bras. They had to be made special.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.199
You're being silly, Kimmy.

16:31.282 --> 16:36.078
Good thing I'm back <i>pack</i>
to stop you from changing anything!

16:36.162 --> 16:37.788
Now, come on.

16:37.872 --> 16:41.167
Let's go on an adventure!

16:41.250 --> 16:42.668
Yes, Jan.

16:42.752 --> 16:44.003
An adventure.

16:45.254 --> 16:46.297
Some say...

16:46.964 --> 16:48.716
the greatest adventure of all.

16:51.385 --> 16:53.179
[indistinct chatter]

16:55.723 --> 16:57.808
[whispering] Why won't that little monster
text me?

16:57.892 --> 17:00.186
Girl, put your phone away.
Eyes on the smize.

17:00.603 --> 17:03.564
Well, we are very excited
to hear this pitch.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.233
I... oh.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.278
Oh, uh, don't mind him.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.614
We found that executives
are 30% less likely

17:11.696 --> 17:13.741
to commit sex crimes
when their children are present,

17:13.824 --> 17:15.034
so it's company policy.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.493
Thank you for your service.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.914
- #MrFrumpus, right?
- [laughing]

17:23.459 --> 17:25.877
Well, this is <i>The Capist</i>!

17:25.962 --> 17:28.130
We open on Greenmulax,

17:28.214 --> 17:29.590
a magical land...

17:29.674 --> 17:32.093
That could easily be shot
in Long Island or Atlanta.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.386
[Titus]...where every boy

17:33.469 --> 17:35.429
is born with a little monster inside him.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.681
A little monster!

17:37.265 --> 17:40.142
- A little monster?
- [Titus] "Usually, they're very friendly,

17:40.726 --> 17:43.020
but every now and then,
they try to trick you.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.566
Sometimes, for the little monster,
a no means yes."

17:46.649 --> 17:49.986
[gasps] The little monster said no
when it meant yes.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.031
Xan did want me to go
to the doctor's with her

17:54.115 --> 17:55.825
because she's terrified!

17:59.579 --> 18:02.331
When you pay ten percent,
they stay for ten percent of the meeting.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.960
[laughing]

18:09.463 --> 18:12.383
Young, hot not-real-Mommy is here.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.759
God, Jacqueline, knock!

18:13.843 --> 18:14.677
Look,

18:14.760 --> 18:17.096
I know we're not technically
family anymore,

18:17.179 --> 18:19.015
but I'm not letting you do this alone.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.559
I always thought your hands
would be slimy.

18:21.642 --> 18:23.561
Not since the operation.

18:23.644 --> 18:25.229
Well, you're not pregnant,

18:25.313 --> 18:27.565
but I still think we should schedule
a C-section.

18:27.648 --> 18:30.484
Oh, hello, Jacqueline. How's your vagina?

18:30.568 --> 18:31.819
Mezzo-mezzo.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.905
But wait, she's not pregnant?

18:34.989 --> 18:36.490
Then why'd I stop getting my period?

18:36.574 --> 18:38.284
Stress-induced amenorrhea.

18:38.367 --> 18:40.411
It's fairly common among gymnasts,

18:40.494 --> 18:41.537
bunker victims,

18:41.621 --> 18:42.872
millennial college students,

18:42.955 --> 18:44.749
and people on roller skates
carrying hot soup.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.752
- Didn't you take a home test?
- Yeah,

18:47.835 --> 18:49.879
but I was too embarrassed
to buy it on campus,

18:49.962 --> 18:52.006
so I went to this place in Spanish Harlem,

18:52.089 --> 18:54.759
and now that I'm thinking,
it might have been less of a pharmacy

18:54.842 --> 18:56.552
and more of a Dominican joke shop.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.471
They sold Robinson Canó masks.

19:00.765 --> 19:01.682
Hmm.

19:01.766 --> 19:05.686
[in Spanish]
"Jane the Virgin" brand pregnancy test!

19:05.895 --> 19:07.688
Trick your friends!

19:07.772 --> 19:08.773
Mystery solved.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.318
Now, can I get anyone IVF triplets or...

19:12.401 --> 19:14.195
Just the check. Thank you, Doctor.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.321
Mm.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.406
[Jacqueline sighs]

19:19.450 --> 19:20.868
Sorry I wasted your time.

19:20.951 --> 19:21.869
I'll, um...

19:22.995 --> 19:24.830
call you next pregnancy scare, I guess.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.332
Get dressed. This is over.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
I mean, get dressed.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.418
This <i>isn't </i> over.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.921
I'm sorry,
I've only ever heard it the other way.

19:32.630 --> 19:35.549
[piano music playing]

19:39.345 --> 19:41.097
[Lillian] Looking for someone?

19:42.640 --> 19:45.351
- How did you get in here?
- You'd have known I had one of these

19:45.434 --> 19:47.978
if you had seen Artie and my's sex tape.

19:48.062 --> 19:49.522
- Ugh.
- [Lillian] FYI,

19:49.605 --> 19:51.732
I think he might've had
a thing for your maid.

19:51.816 --> 19:53.067
Like father, like daughter.

19:53.150 --> 19:54.026
Huh.

19:54.527 --> 19:57.530
I think Ethan would be
very interested to hear

19:57.613 --> 19:59.949
what his sister was really up to,

20:00.032 --> 20:04.036
and you told me exactly
where and when to find him.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.288
[sighs]

20:08.499 --> 20:11.293
Oh, did I "accidentally" tell you

20:11.377 --> 20:13.546
where Ethan was gonna be so you could

20:13.629 --> 20:15.172
come and confront him?

20:15.881 --> 20:16.757
Yes?

20:16.841 --> 20:20.553
And you think he's gonna listen to you,

20:20.636 --> 20:24.348
the gold digger who didn't care enough
to show up to the funeral

20:24.432 --> 20:28.310
but <i>did </i> show up to the will-reading?

20:28.394 --> 20:33.149
See, I saw through you
seeing through me seeing through you...

20:34.692 --> 20:36.110
seeing through me.

20:36.193 --> 20:37.445
- Hmm.
- [Sheba] Ethan!

20:37.528 --> 20:39.488
Look what the cat dragged in.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.783
Cats, plural,
and they left me at the curb.

20:42.867 --> 20:45.453
Good Lord, Lillian.
This, you could come to?

20:45.536 --> 20:47.997
I thought Sheba was the family screwup,

20:48.080 --> 20:51.041
but the minute she grew out of it,
my father had to bring in a new one.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.421
Yeah.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.091
We are a lot alike, aren't we?

20:59.175 --> 21:01.677
That's why we're in each other's heads.

21:01.761 --> 21:02.887
Except that...

21:02.970 --> 21:07.141
when you thought
you were seeing through me

21:07.224 --> 21:08.642
seeing through you

21:08.726 --> 21:10.853
seeing through me seeing through you,

21:10.936 --> 21:12.438
I was actually

21:12.521 --> 21:15.274
seeing through <i>you</i> seeing through <i>me</i>

21:15.357 --> 21:17.902
seeing through <i>you </i> seeing through <i>me...</i>

21:18.319 --> 21:20.988
seeing through you!

21:22.490 --> 21:23.324
What?

21:25.409 --> 21:28.829
You know, whenever I need
to impress the judge

21:28.913 --> 21:32.750
or the guy from the Department of Health,
Cats Quantity Division,

21:32.833 --> 21:35.669
I cover up my tattoos.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.505
Oh, God! Ow! No, don't--

21:37.588 --> 21:39.715
Hold still, missy!

21:39.799 --> 21:41.258
[both shout]

21:41.342 --> 21:42.426
[guests gasp]

21:42.510 --> 21:44.470
[Ethan] "Mike Tyson's Face Tattoo"?

21:44.553 --> 21:46.055
[Sheba] I asked for that,

21:46.138 --> 21:47.890
and then I fell asleep in the chair.

21:48.349 --> 21:51.435
And why haven't I ever
seen you in a skirt?

21:51.519 --> 21:52.770
I mean, it's spring,

21:52.853 --> 21:54.688
and you've got gams that say "bam."

21:54.772 --> 21:56.106
[sighs]

21:57.358 --> 21:58.859
[guests gasp]

21:58.943 --> 22:02.780
Ha! A court-ordered ankle bracelet! Ha-ha!

22:02.863 --> 22:06.951
I didn't know you could get a DUI
on a stolen police horse.

22:07.034 --> 22:08.702
You told me you stopped drinking.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.246
[Lillian] And what's in here?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.330
Is it...

22:11.413 --> 22:13.290
pills? Grass?

22:13.374 --> 22:15.125
[guffaws]

22:15.543 --> 22:17.419
- Hoo!
- It's empty

22:17.503 --> 22:19.088
because I shoplifted it

22:19.171 --> 22:20.464
on the way over,

22:20.548 --> 22:22.007
okay?

22:22.091 --> 22:25.469
She's trying to trick you
into handing over her trust fund,

22:25.553 --> 22:28.347
but this girl is ten cents' worth

22:28.430 --> 22:30.474
of "God, help us."

22:31.308 --> 22:32.851
Don't fall for it.

22:32.935 --> 22:34.311
Look... [sighs]

22:34.395 --> 22:36.897
My dad always saw the best in my sister,

22:37.481 --> 22:38.482
but being her conservator

22:38.566 --> 22:41.443
took the patience of a Jewish saint
like Artie Goodman.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.404
[Lillian] Wait,

22:43.487 --> 22:44.905
what are you trying to say?

22:44.989 --> 22:46.240
I'm not my father.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.535
I've got my own children to take care of,
and Sheba's...

22:49.618 --> 22:50.452
an adult?

22:50.536 --> 22:52.746
It breaks my heart,
but if she wants to waste her life,

22:52.830 --> 22:54.832
well... I can't stop her.

22:56.417 --> 22:58.085
[cheers]

22:58.168 --> 23:01.255
I'm gonna clone my dead dog,
like, 100 times.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.172
I mean, first...

23:02.256 --> 23:03.966
I gotta find a live dog, but...

23:04.049 --> 23:05.301
[Sheba laughs]

23:06.552 --> 23:08.596
I'm so sorry this didn't work out, Titus.

23:08.679 --> 23:12.975
Young adult fantasy just doesn't fit
into our current slate of gritty dramas

23:13.058 --> 23:15.227
and women unwrapping crinkly packages.

23:15.311 --> 23:16.687
Oh, darn.

23:16.770 --> 23:18.063
I really wanted to write

23:18.147 --> 23:20.190
100 episodes of <i>The Capist.</i>

23:20.274 --> 23:23.444
Yeah, so Greg Kinnear and The Capist
would have shown up in episode two or...

23:23.527 --> 23:25.321
Mm, probably.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.364
[man] Well, the idea
may not have been good,

23:27.448 --> 23:29.867
but you! Oh, you were terrific!

23:30.367 --> 23:32.119
Really charismatic.

23:32.703 --> 23:33.787
You're no writer, Titus,

23:33.871 --> 23:35.956
but you're a natural-born actor.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.626
And then when the other person
stops talking, you talk.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.836
Hey. We're producing

23:40.919 --> 23:42.838
Katherine Heigl's second-to-last chance.

23:42.921 --> 23:44.590
Straight to series, pre-canceled,

23:44.673 --> 23:45.966
and you would be perfect

23:46.050 --> 23:48.260
for the guy that walks down long hallways
with her.

23:48.344 --> 23:49.553
You wanna come in and read?

23:49.637 --> 23:50.929
I'd love to!

23:51.013 --> 23:52.973
But how long are these hallways?

23:53.057 --> 23:55.100
I mean, could my character
be in a wheelchair?

23:56.060 --> 24:00.564
[laughs]

24:00.648 --> 24:03.317
And he stepped <i>on </i> the ball!

24:03.400 --> 24:04.902
[laughing]

24:05.486 --> 24:08.822
Okay, which one of you
futon stains is Cappy Tylenol?

24:08.906 --> 24:09.907
Me.

24:09.990 --> 24:13.327
Let me explain something,
you flip-flops-to-church toddler.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.454
Women are human beings,

24:15.537 --> 24:17.414
and they deserve your respect.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.541
If you hear a little voice in your head

24:19.625 --> 24:23.295
saying that you're more important
because you can pee standing up

24:23.379 --> 24:25.506
and drive a car in Saudi Arabia...

24:26.298 --> 24:27.758
don't believe it.

24:28.050 --> 24:32.429
Now, tell your friends what happened
between you and Xan.

24:35.891 --> 24:38.102
We only did it for, like, ten seconds

24:38.185 --> 24:39.937
- before I--
- No, not that.

24:40.813 --> 24:43.065
We didn't use a condom
because they're all too big for me.

24:43.148 --> 24:45.943
No. Jesus. The other stuff.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.946
Xan didn't cheat on me.

24:49.029 --> 24:51.448
I got scared, so I made up
a bunch of lies about her.

24:51.532 --> 24:52.741
It's not my fault.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.368
Why are men so believed?

24:54.451 --> 24:55.285
Xan.

24:56.578 --> 24:58.455
Just FYI, I'm not pregnant,

24:58.539 --> 25:00.749
but now <i>I'm</i> breaking up with you.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.835
Not because you lied about me

25:02.918 --> 25:05.254
but because your breath
smells like bologna...

25:05.713 --> 25:08.090
even when you haven't eaten bologna.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.385
Let's go.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.430
[rock music playing]

25:19.935 --> 25:20.853
Oh!

25:22.104 --> 25:23.063
Sorry, boys.

25:26.108 --> 25:27.484
She's coming with us.

25:27.568 --> 25:29.069
<i>And to Uncle Stanley,</i>

25:29.153 --> 25:33.699
<i>I leave my collection
of hilarious practical jokes and gags.</i>

<i>My son, Ethan.</i>

25:49.339 --> 25:51.341
<i>It'll come as no surprise that</i>

25:51.425 --> 25:52.968
<i>you'll take over Big Naturals</i>

<i>That guy really jewed me.</i>

26:09.526 --> 26:10.527
<i>I can say that.</i>

[both] What? That can't be right!

26:30.297 --> 26:32.090
<i>Sheba, darling, I love you,</i>

26:39.139 --> 26:41.308
<i>the time on your hands. Let's be honest.</i>

26:41.391 --> 26:45.187
You mean, every time
this Tide Pod-eating brat wants money,

26:45.270 --> 26:47.189
she has to call me for permission?

26:47.272 --> 26:48.398
[Sheba] And every time I need

26:48.482 --> 26:50.734
money to buy Tide Pods so I can eat them,

26:50.818 --> 26:51.777
I've gotta call her?

26:51.860 --> 26:53.737
[guests chuckling]

26:53.821 --> 26:57.533

<i>They're already fighting, aren't they?</i>

27:02.329 --> 27:03.580
[Kimmy] It's a pretty view,

27:03.664 --> 27:04.706
isn't it, Jan?

27:04.790 --> 27:08.919
Whoa, that cloud looks like a dragon!

27:09.002 --> 27:10.838
Mm-hmm. It sure does.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.424
What do the other clouds look like?

27:15.551 --> 27:18.345
That's an ice cream sundae, and...

27:18.929 --> 27:21.056
Oh... boy, Kimmy,

27:21.139 --> 27:24.268
those imaginary supplies sure feel heavy.

27:24.351 --> 27:26.854
Well, we're going on a long trip.

Kimmy,
I'm <i>not </i> just a backpack for a little kid!

I can do adult stuff!
You can put work papers in me!

No! Don't do this! [pants]

There's half a pack of Starburst in me!

27:59.928 --> 28:01.305
You can have it!

28:01.388 --> 28:04.224

a guy who can get pinks!

28:12.316 --> 28:14.526
Strangers are just friends

28:15.235 --> 28:16.069
Hello?

28:17.738 --> 28:21.617
Hi. Is this the writer
of <i>The Legends of Greenmulax</i> ?

28:21.700 --> 28:24.203
- How'd you get this number?
- [boy] <i>It was on your book.</i>

28:24.286 --> 28:26.121
I found it in the trash at my dad's work

28:26.204 --> 28:28.749
and read it
while he was wrestling his secretary.

28:28.832 --> 28:29.708
The trash?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.418
Great.

28:31.501 --> 28:33.086
Look, I'm in the middle of something.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.504
She's trying to kill me!

28:34.588 --> 28:37.174
- Shh! Shh!
- Tell the cops I'm under a dragon cloud!

28:37.257 --> 28:38.926
- Shh!
- [boy] <i> Can I call you later</i>

28:39.009 --> 28:41.178
and find out what happens
in the next book?

28:42.262 --> 28:43.138
Really?

28:43.639 --> 28:44.473
You liked it?

28:44.556 --> 28:45.641
I loved it!

28:45.724 --> 28:48.143
<i>But do they ever escape Greenmulax?</i>

28:48.227 --> 28:50.812
<i>Do the boys figure out
how to control their monsters?</i>

28:50.896 --> 28:53.565
And why does society
keep feeding the monsters?

28:53.649 --> 28:54.566
Well,

28:54.942 --> 28:59.238
it turns out Greenmulax is just a mirage
created by the Grabagorns.

28:59.321 --> 29:01.531
What? No way!

29:01.615 --> 29:05.869
I don't wanna give away everything,
but each boy is born with a key inside him

29:05.953 --> 29:07.454
to tame his own monster!

29:07.537 --> 29:09.122
That's their one weakness!

29:09.206 --> 29:10.749
Oh! I get it.

29:10.832 --> 29:13.418
- [boy talking excitedly]
- Oh! Oh, God, thank you, Kimmy.

29:13.502 --> 29:17.130
Oh, that was worse than being
that homeless guy's toilet.

29:17.214 --> 29:18.924
Oh, thank you.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.134
[boy] <i> What if the boy
chooses self-control...</i>

29:21.218 --> 29:23.971
Oh, I love it! Yeah,
this is going to be so much better.

29:24.054 --> 29:26.598
- [boy chattering]
- [Kimmy] Yeah?

[ominous music overlaps]

30:13.061 --> 30:16.940
[camera shutter clicking]

30:17.190 --> 30:19.401
[phone dialing]

30:19.484 --> 30:22.237
[man in Hebrew] I have eyes on the target.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.740
Moving to phase two.
