00:00.301 --> 00:02.963
Magnum, I know
you fell in love
with Diane...

00:03.037 --> 00:05.562
but how about bracing up
and getting on with your life?

00:05.640 --> 00:06.629
No!

00:09.243 --> 00:10.437
Mac!

00:10.611 --> 00:12.772
He's alive. Mac's alive!

00:12.847 --> 00:15.873
<i>If Magnum thinks he saw Mac,</i>
<i>he suffered an hallucination.</i>

00:15.950 --> 00:18.510
Now, I don't blame you
for being upset,
but I can explain.

00:18.586 --> 00:19.883
I want answers!

00:19.954 --> 00:21.421
What did I do
that was so wrong?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.081
You're a conman
and a thief!

00:23.157 --> 00:24.715
I'm not a thief.
You're not a...

00:24.792 --> 00:25.850
Mac!

02:23.010 --> 02:24.341
I love you.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.210
<i>No!</i>

02:41.362 --> 02:42.829
Oh, Thomas!

02:44.632 --> 02:45.860
Traitor!

02:58.779 --> 03:00.007
Hey...

03:00.081 --> 03:03.539
what do you say
we drive up to Pali Lookout
and watch the sunrise?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.278
You know? It'd be beautiful!

03:09.657 --> 03:10.646
<i>Hey!</i>

03:10.758 --> 03:11.747
Hey!

03:19.066 --> 03:20.294
Magnum?

03:27.108 --> 03:30.202
I don't mind if you want
to drink yourself to death.

03:31.278 --> 03:34.270
But I draw the line
at littering.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.508
You're right.

03:35.883 --> 03:39.011
I'm sorry.
I can go to pot,
but not the estate.

03:44.158 --> 03:45.819
Don't you think
you're overdoing this?

03:45.893 --> 03:48.418
Nope! I littered,
I have to pick it up.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.957
That's not
what I'm talking about.

03:52.133 --> 03:55.068
Look, I'm afraid
you'll have to be
more specific.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.772
My mind is a bit foggy
at the moment.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.340
Must be due
to lack of sleep.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.775
If you're going to
drink yourself
into a stupor...

04:04.845 --> 04:06.745
wouldn't whiskey
be more effective?

04:06.814 --> 04:09.749
Too hard to keep
an even buzz on
with whiskey.

04:36.810 --> 04:38.937
In the five years
I've known you...

04:39.013 --> 04:41.379
you've debauched yourself
many times...

04:41.982 --> 04:43.813
but never
anything like this.

04:45.319 --> 04:47.378
How long are you going to
keep this up?

04:49.290 --> 04:51.190
Look, Higgins,
I know this is stupid.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.226
I know this isn't
going to solve anything.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.956
I know Diane's
committing suicide
wasn't my fault...

04:56.030 --> 04:57.827
and there was nothing
I could have done.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.492
Well, why this orgy
of punishment?

05:01.735 --> 05:04.704
How about bracing up
and getting on with your life?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.701
I know you fell in love
with Diane, but...

05:07.775 --> 05:09.572
It's not just Diane!

05:14.281 --> 05:15.680
It's Michelle...

05:16.584 --> 05:17.949
and Mac...

05:18.552 --> 05:20.543
Rick's little sister,
Dan Cook...

05:20.621 --> 05:24.022
the little Vietnamese kid
whose name I can't remember.

05:27.461 --> 05:28.621
My dad.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.161
All people I loved...

05:34.401 --> 05:35.868
or who counted on me...

05:35.936 --> 05:37.198
they're gone.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.505
Death is part of life. <i>I...</i>

05:43.043 --> 05:45.204
I know
that sounds trite, but...

05:45.579 --> 05:48.241
the very nature of life means
that the older we get...

05:48.315 --> 05:50.613
the more losses
we're going to experience.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.510
And, if we go to war...

05:53.587 --> 05:55.953
or choose a profession
such as yours...

05:56.457 --> 05:58.687
those losses
are going to be higher.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.351
Look, Higgins...

06:04.098 --> 06:07.158
I know you're trying to help,
and I appreciate it.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.164
I really do.

06:12.439 --> 06:14.304
I know this isn't
going to solve anything...

06:14.375 --> 06:16.172
I know I'm being morose.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.143
And stupid.

06:21.448 --> 06:23.040
But I just don't give a damn.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.090
<i>It wasn't true.</i>

06:34.261 --> 06:35.592
<i>I did give a damn...</i>

06:35.663 --> 06:38.461
<i>otherwise I wouldn't be</i>
<i>so disgusted with myself.</i>

06:39.233 --> 06:42.999
<i>But Diane's suicide</i>
<i>had started something</i>
<i>I couldn't stop.</i>

07:11.198 --> 07:12.290
Mac!

07:15.402 --> 07:16.596
You wanna live long, buddy?

07:16.670 --> 07:17.932
Mac!

07:28.749 --> 07:30.148
What's the problem, bro?

07:33.220 --> 07:34.482
Magnum?

07:34.922 --> 07:37.220
He's alive. Mac's alive!

07:39.460 --> 07:41.621
<i>Would you please stop</i>
<i>that infernal pacing?</i>

07:41.695 --> 07:44.425
One would think
you were some poor animal
caged in a zoo.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.125
I can't help it.
I get nervous
in hospitals.

07:46.200 --> 07:48.668
In case you haven't noticed,
this is not a hospital.

07:48.736 --> 07:49.998
Leave him alone, Higgie.

07:50.070 --> 07:52.265
And would you decide
whether you're going to wear
that cap...

07:52.339 --> 07:53.863
or throttle it to death?

07:53.941 --> 07:57.308
The two of you
are as nervous as a pair
of Devonshire school girls.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.410
And you're not?
No.

07:59.480 --> 08:03.211
Then why have you been
sipping tea from an empty cup
for the last half-hour?

08:10.858 --> 08:13.418
I gave him enough Seconal
to put a horse to sleep...

08:13.494 --> 08:15.587
but I wouldn't bet on him
staying under till morning.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.027
Is he going to be all right?

08:17.097 --> 08:18.223
I don't know.

08:18.298 --> 08:19.788
What do you mean,
you don't know?

08:20.134 --> 08:21.294
Just what I said.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.161
Diane's suicide
hit Magnum hard,
very hard.

08:25.572 --> 08:28.439
A certain amount
of guilt and depression
is to be expected.

08:29.109 --> 08:31.509
But his actions today
go far beyond that.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.748
Yeah, well, he's tough.

08:35.149 --> 08:36.582
He'll bounce back.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.878
He always has.

08:37.951 --> 08:40.181
T.C., everybody has a limit,
even Magnum.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.681
Black, right?

08:42.756 --> 08:43.745
Yeah.

08:43.823 --> 08:46.054
I got used to that
when I was an intern.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.787
Couldn't afford
the cream and sugar.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.492
We'll have to wait
until morning...

08:56.670 --> 08:58.001
to see how he is.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.975
Who is this Mac
he's hallucinating?

09:03.577 --> 09:06.102
Oh,
Lieutenant MacReynolds.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.907
He was killed
a couple of years ago...

09:07.981 --> 09:10.541
when this guy named Ivan
blew up Magnum's Ferrari.

09:10.617 --> 09:11.914
Mr. Masters'
Ferrari.

09:11.985 --> 09:13.850
What difference
does it make, Higgins?
None.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.087
I'd say Magnum's
not the only one
who's wired around here.

09:19.426 --> 09:20.552
Well...

09:20.627 --> 09:21.753
all right.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.160
He should be out
the whole night...

09:24.231 --> 09:26.165
but I would not
leave him alone.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.860
No, of course not.
Yeah, we'll stay.

09:30.537 --> 09:32.004
I'll be back
around 10:00...

09:32.339 --> 09:35.001
and I'll decide then
whether or not
to hospitalize him.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.133
You don't have
to do that, Doc...

09:36.210 --> 09:37.541
we can take care of him
right here.

09:38.812 --> 09:41.474
I'm talking about
a mental hospital, gentlemen.

09:42.549 --> 09:43.573
Good night.

10:14.815 --> 10:15.941
Hey...

10:16.416 --> 10:19.783
what do you say
we drive up to Pali Lookout
and watch the sunrise?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.614
You know? It'd be beautiful!

11:02.930 --> 11:05.194
Hi, guys!
What are you doing here?

11:07.200 --> 11:09.498
Hey, I'm starved. How about
some breakfast? I'm fixing.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.665
I got some eggs,
I think, and some bacon.

11:12.739 --> 11:14.604
Maybe some sausage,
let me see.

11:14.675 --> 11:17.109
Yeah, I got sausage,
I even got some lox...

11:17.177 --> 11:19.771
and some cream cheese.
Bagels are hard, though.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.240
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.110
Well, what happened
yesterday?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.585
Well, I guess,
I went off the deep end
thinking I saw Mac.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.216
You could say that.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.348
Yeah, but I'm fine now.
How do you want your eggs?

11:35.629 --> 11:36.994
Thanks, guys.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.965
Well, how's
it look?

11:40.233 --> 11:42.394
Rick always was a whiz
with the old shears.

11:42.469 --> 11:43.834
Well, it's somewhat
of an improvement...

11:43.904 --> 11:46.168
over your previous
tonsorial treatment.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.900
I think he missed
his calling.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.835
I'm sure it'll
lay down eventually.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.003
Magnum.
Yeah?

11:53.080 --> 11:56.914
Do you think it wise
for you to drive
so soon after <i>your...</i>

11:57.751 --> 11:59.309
Illness?
Yes.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.922
I've been pretty far
around the bend.
I know that.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.459
Whether it was hallucinating
about Mac, <i>or...</i>

12:08.261 --> 12:10.593
Doc's shot letting me sleep,
I don't know.

12:11.465 --> 12:12.932
Whatever it was...

12:13.667 --> 12:15.362
I woke up this morning, and...

12:16.370 --> 12:18.838
everything was in perspective.
I'm fine.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.465
Really.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.372
And I appreciate
your concern.

12:27.014 --> 12:28.345
I'll see you later.

12:41.028 --> 12:44.589
Come, lads. We still have time
to catch the last ten minutes
of <i>Lassie.</i>

12:47.401 --> 12:50.302
<i>Sometimes the hardest thing</i>
<i>to face is reality.</i>

12:50.370 --> 12:51.735
<i>My friends</i>
<i>really cared about me...</i>

12:51.805 --> 12:54.035
<i>but if I'd insisted</i>
<i>Mac was alive...</i>

12:54.107 --> 12:56.200
<i>they'd have thrown me</i>
<i>into a padded room.</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:58.839
<i>I knew Mac was back.</i>

12:58.912 --> 13:01.540
<i>It wasn't my imagination,</i>
<i>or a hallucination.</i>

13:01.615 --> 13:02.946
<i>He was here.</i>

13:03.016 --> 13:04.847
<i>And I was going to find him.</i>

13:31.811 --> 13:33.139
<i>After three days</i>
<i>of surveillance...</i>

13:33.213 --> 13:35.613
<i>I was familiar</i>
<i>with the rhythm of the street.</i>

13:35.682 --> 13:36.842
<i>At 9:00 in the morning...</i>

13:36.916 --> 13:41.216
<i>those about to be sacrificed</i>
<i>to the Hawaiian gods of sun,</i>
<i>sea and sand...</i>

13:41.521 --> 13:44.217
<i>were making</i>
<i>their ritualistic trek</i>
<i>to the beach.</i>

13:44.290 --> 13:48.454
<i>I knew from experience</i>
<i>that very few would return</i>
<i>with their skin.</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:52.355
<i>At noon...</i>

13:52.432 --> 13:55.799
<i>the late-risers</i>
<i>and serious souvenir-hunters</i>
<i>were prowling about...</i>

13:55.869 --> 14:00.670
<i>snatching up bargain buys</i>
<i>on plastic hula skirts</i>
<i>and cheap coral beads.</i>

14:07.547 --> 14:10.243
<i>At 3:15, I got</i>
<i>my afternoon treat.</i>

14:21.861 --> 14:24.625
<i>I called her Olga,</i>
<i>for obvious reasons.</i>

14:24.697 --> 14:28.827
<i>The cops are pretty good</i>
<i>about keeping hookers off</i>
<i>the street during the day...</i>

14:28.902 --> 14:31.302
<i>but I guess</i>
<i>when you're as big as Olga...</i>

14:31.371 --> 14:33.396
<i>you can work</i>
<i>any time you want.</i>

14:38.311 --> 14:42.247
<i>By sunset,</i>
<i>the last of the lobsters</i>
<i>were returning from the beach.</i>

14:42.482 --> 14:44.313
<i>Which meant</i>
<i>my day was nearly over...</i>

14:44.384 --> 14:46.818
<i>and all I had to show for it</i>
<i>was a sore butt...</i>

14:46.886 --> 14:48.319
<i>and a case of heartburn.</i>

15:00.533 --> 15:01.761
It's him.

15:04.971 --> 15:07.030
I'm not hallucinating.

15:19.018 --> 15:21.009
Mac never could
pass up ice cream!

15:56.289 --> 15:57.916
<i>Suddenly, I was afraid.</i>

15:58.358 --> 16:01.020
<i>Mac was dead.</i>
<i>I'd seen him die.</i>

16:01.094 --> 16:03.221
<i>I consoled his parents,</i>
<i>helped bury him.</i>

16:03.596 --> 16:06.121
<i>Yet, there he was,</i>
<i>just 10 feet away from me.</i>

16:06.766 --> 16:08.290
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>if I got too close...</i>

16:08.368 --> 16:10.461
<i>if I touched</i>
<i>or spoke to him...</i>

16:10.537 --> 16:12.027
<i>he'd disappear.</i>

17:19.105 --> 17:20.196
Mac?

17:43.129 --> 17:44.721
Are you looking for me?

17:49.168 --> 17:50.294
Mac.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.213
I don't know how...

18:02.015 --> 18:03.312
or <i>why...</i>

18:04.984 --> 18:07.418
If you're a ghost or what,
but, God!

18:08.254 --> 18:09.448
Feels good
to see you!

18:11.157 --> 18:12.590
I...

18:13.760 --> 18:16.558
think you're confusing me
with someone else, son.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.529
My name's not Mac.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.567
I'm
Lieutenant Commander Hiller.

18:21.968 --> 18:24.232
But most of the men
call me Father Jim.

18:34.447 --> 18:35.436
<i>Mac's a priest?</i>

18:36.149 --> 18:37.673
Not Mac, Father Jim!

18:37.750 --> 18:40.776
But I'll tell you guys,
he is the spitting image
of Mac...

18:40.853 --> 18:43.014
except for the mustache.
I've never seen
anything like it.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.649
I have. In India,
back in '49.

18:45.992 --> 18:48.961
I was assigned
to Lord Mountbatten
as his temporary batman...

18:49.028 --> 18:53.089
while his Sergeant Major
recovered from a mishap
with a sacred cow.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.497
We never really
quite understood...

18:54.567 --> 18:56.626
how he managed to
so infuriate that animal.

18:56.703 --> 18:58.261
They're really
quite docile, you know.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.397
I recall once,
outside Calcutta...

19:00.473 --> 19:01.963
Higgins,
what's your point?

19:03.643 --> 19:06.874
One day, Lord Mountbatten
wanted some fresh figs.

19:07.080 --> 19:08.547
The man loved figs.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.678
So, I went
to the local market...

19:11.751 --> 19:13.241
and that's where it happened.

19:13.319 --> 19:14.377
What?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.822
The same sort of thing
that's happened to Magnum.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.591
I came face to face
with a holy man...

19:20.660 --> 19:22.457
who looked exactly like...
You.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.324
Poor guy!

19:27.567 --> 19:28.932
Like my mother.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.538
It was bloody frightening.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.437
T.C., what time is it?

19:34.507 --> 19:38.443
It's exactly
five minutes later than it was
the last time you asked.

19:39.145 --> 19:40.840
He's supposed to
be here at noon.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.505
Well, he's only
27 minutes late.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.482
Perhaps he got caught
in traffic.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.877
So...

19:45.952 --> 19:47.544
what did he say
when you told him about Mac?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.645
Well, I think
he thought I was crazy.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.950
But then I showed him...

19:51.023 --> 19:53.651
you know, the picture I have
in my wallet of Mac, Julie
and I...

19:53.726 --> 19:55.717
at Luau Louie's
the night he was killed.

19:57.063 --> 20:00.089
Look, why don't you guys
go ahead and order
and I'll wait for Father Jim?

20:00.166 --> 20:01.565
You're sure you don't mind?

20:01.634 --> 20:04.262
Oh, don't be silly.
Look, Father Jim will be here
any minute...

20:04.337 --> 20:05.998
and then I'll order.
Go ahead, guys.

20:14.781 --> 20:15.941
Magnum...

20:16.115 --> 20:19.915
the day you told us
you had hallucinated
seeing Mac...

20:20.119 --> 20:21.586
you didn't believe that,
did you?

20:21.654 --> 20:22.985
No.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.613
I knew I saw him.

20:24.857 --> 20:27.382
But if I'd kept trying
to convince you guys
and Doc Ibold...

20:27.460 --> 20:29.291
I would have ended up
in a padded room.

20:30.463 --> 20:34.092
So you spent the day
surveying the street
with a telescope.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.394
Camera.

20:35.668 --> 20:38.432
You wouldn't give me
Robin's telescope, remember?

20:39.505 --> 20:40.597
Yes.

20:45.111 --> 20:46.442
Did you take a picture of him?

20:46.913 --> 20:48.073
Mac?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.278
I mean, Father Jim? No.

20:54.220 --> 20:55.778
Why not?
Because!

20:55.855 --> 20:59.222
I was only using the camera
because it had a 300mm zoom.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.318
You don't believe me, do you?

21:04.464 --> 21:08.457
I believe you saw someone,
or thought you saw someone...

21:08.534 --> 21:10.434
Met! Met him.

21:10.736 --> 21:12.931
Talked to him,
had a drink with him.

21:13.005 --> 21:15.496
I showed him Mac's picture.
He told me his name!

21:15.975 --> 21:17.567
Said he'd meet me here
for lunch!

21:21.214 --> 21:24.615
T.C., you remember.
When I told you
that Michelle was here...

21:24.684 --> 21:25.946
you didn't believe me!

21:26.219 --> 21:27.379
Yeah.

21:28.454 --> 21:29.887
And I was wrong.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.889
That's why I believe you now.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.485
Me, too.

21:36.996 --> 21:39.726
I'd like to believe you met
someone who looks like Mac.

21:40.166 --> 21:41.190
But you don't.

21:41.267 --> 21:44.168
Under the circumstances,
I think it highly unlikely.

21:44.704 --> 21:48.299
I think the possibility
that you're hallucinating
is one we should not ignore.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.541
I am not hallucinating,
Higgins!

21:50.610 --> 21:52.043
And I can prove it.

21:52.111 --> 21:53.271
Hey, where are you going?

21:53.346 --> 21:54.870
To Pearl!
I'm gonna find Father Jim.

21:54.947 --> 21:57.279
I'll bring him back here
so you can all see
for yourselves!

22:00.286 --> 22:01.378
Now look
what you've done.

22:02.321 --> 22:06.223
Father Jim, if he exists,
is one hour and 33 minutes
late.

22:06.292 --> 22:08.021
He hasn't called,
so unless the poor man...

22:08.094 --> 22:09.755
has had an incredible
emergency...

22:09.829 --> 22:11.490
or some sort
of an accident...

22:11.564 --> 22:13.293
it is highly probable
that he is a figment...

22:13.366 --> 22:15.800
of Magnum's distraught
imagination.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.632
And sitting here saying,
"We're with you, old buddy"...

22:18.704 --> 22:20.763
isn't doing him
a bloody bit of good!

22:29.782 --> 22:32.182
I'm looking for
Lieutenant Commander Hiller.

22:32.251 --> 22:34.185
His yeoman said
I might find him here.

22:34.253 --> 22:37.780
Yeah. I just saw Father Jim.
He was doing laps.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.757
Must have headed
for the showers.

22:39.825 --> 22:41.156
They're through the doors.
Through the doors?

22:41.227 --> 22:42.717
Yeah, I know.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.056
Thanks.

22:44.797 --> 22:47.163
<i>Ensign Jessup,</i>
<i>telephone, line 3.</i>

22:47.233 --> 22:49.861
<i>Ensign Jessup,</i>
<i>telephone, line 3.</i>

22:53.372 --> 22:54.566
<i>Seaman Clayton...</i>

22:54.640 --> 22:56.904

<i>Barracks 4.</i>

22:56.976 --> 23:00.605
<i>Seaman Clayton,</i>
<i>report to the OOD,</i>
<i>Barracks 4.</i>

23:06.085 --> 23:08.849
I'm glad
you didn't shoot that way
five years ago, Magnum.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.387
Well, I'm a little rusty.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.347
You don't remember me,
do you?

23:13.659 --> 23:15.024
Well, your face
is familiar, but...

23:15.094 --> 23:18.359
Nah, no reason why you should,
I spend most of my time
on the bench.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.161
No, we played
in a benefit game
for the Navy Relief Fund.

23:21.500 --> 23:23.127
You know,
against Schofield Barracks.

23:23.436 --> 23:26.234
Oh, sure! You played guard.
You're a navy <i>chap...</i>

23:27.986 --> 23:28.726
Chaplain.

23:28.759 --> 23:30.454
Yeah, that's me.
Father Jim Hiller.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.478
Where is he now?
Down by the tidal pool.

23:44.503 --> 23:45.414
That's great!

23:45.491 --> 23:47.891
Thomas always swims
when he has things
to figure out.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.484
Well, he isn't swimming.

23:49.828 --> 23:52.319
He's just sitting on the sand,
staring out at the ocean.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.593
Yeah, well,
that's a good way
to solve a problem, too.

23:54.667 --> 23:57.227
<i>Cabin Island!</i>
I loved this as a kid!

23:57.303 --> 23:59.567
I remember one night,
they were lying
in the cabin...

23:59.638 --> 24:01.435
they heard a moan,
they thought
it was a ghost.

24:01.507 --> 24:03.099
And Chet,
he got so scared...

24:03.175 --> 24:04.938
Dr. Ibold,
with all due respect...

24:05.010 --> 24:08.207
I don't think that now
is the time for childhood
literary recollections.

24:08.714 --> 24:11.376
Until Dr. Trapp gets here,
there's nothing more I can do.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.918
This Dr. Trapp,
what did he say?

24:13.986 --> 24:17.513
Well, there really wasn't
very much he could say,
until he examines Magnum.

24:17.923 --> 24:21.154
But he doubted
that he was suffering from
a hallucination, you <i>know...</i>

24:21.627 --> 24:23.026
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls.</i>

24:23.095 --> 24:26.394
<i>For Whom the Bell Tolls!</i>
A great, sexy book
in its time.

24:26.565 --> 24:28.260
You remember,
they were lying
in that sleeping bag...

24:28.334 --> 24:29.562
the night before
they blew the bridge...

24:29.635 --> 24:32.195
Wait a minute! Wait a minute.

24:32.671 --> 24:35.538
You saying that Magnum
is not hallucinating?

24:36.108 --> 24:38.201
Dr. Trapp
thought it was unlikely.

24:38.277 --> 24:39.972
Hallucinations
are very rare...

24:40.045 --> 24:42.980
and he thought that Magnum
probably was suffering
from a delusion.

24:43.349 --> 24:44.611
What's the difference?

24:46.385 --> 24:48.853
If Magnum thinks he saw Mac
and no one was there...

24:48.921 --> 24:50.650
he suffered an hallucination.

24:50.723 --> 24:54.124
If someone was there
and Magnum thought
that person was Mac...

24:54.193 --> 24:55.660
he's had a delusion.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.923
I couldn't have
put it better myself.

24:58.063 --> 24:59.291
Thank you, Doctor.

24:59.865 --> 25:01.127
But Rick is right.

25:01.200 --> 25:03.566
I mean, what difference
does it make what you call it?

25:03.635 --> 25:05.330
Either way,
Magnum is in big trouble.

25:05.571 --> 25:06.697
<i>Unless...</i>

25:07.306 --> 25:08.466
<i>Harvey.</i>

25:08.674 --> 25:11.040
<i>Harvey!</i> One of the great
wonderful plays...

25:11.110 --> 25:12.634
Unless what?

25:13.879 --> 25:15.608
Unless Magnum's
telling the truth.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.212
Hold on.

25:22.388 --> 25:23.685
Hold on!

25:24.790 --> 25:27.088
Wasn't Magnum
always conning Mac?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.626
Not just Mac.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.024
Yeah.

25:30.095 --> 25:32.495
And wouldn't we just love
to get even?

25:33.699 --> 25:35.758
I would ask
nothing more of life.

25:36.835 --> 25:38.063
Maybe Mac didn't, either.

25:39.505 --> 25:40.904
Do you realize
what you're saying?

25:40.973 --> 25:42.201
I didn't say it.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.402
Wait, wait. You mean
that Mac's running
a con on Thomas?

25:45.611 --> 25:47.738
That means that Mac is back,
and Mac's dead!

25:49.415 --> 25:51.144
Then it has to be <i>Mac's...</i>

25:54.686 --> 25:55.710
Ghost.

25:55.788 --> 25:56.880
You said it!

26:04.897 --> 26:06.660
I think I got it
figured out, Higgins.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.831
Good. I'd like to hear it.
Oh!

26:15.407 --> 26:16.669
How'd you get here?

26:16.742 --> 26:18.869
I came up the beach
about five miles.

26:18.944 --> 26:20.002
Wanted to see you alone.

26:20.446 --> 26:21.435
Dogs don't count.

26:22.281 --> 26:24.476
Dogs always love me.
I'm like Daniel
and the lions.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.075
You know, you could put me
in the middle of a junkyard
full of Dobies...

26:27.152 --> 26:28.710
and all they'd do
is lick my face.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.486
Who the hell are you?

26:30.756 --> 26:33.020
Well, I guess,
you figured out
I'm not Father Jim.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.317
Well, what would you say
if I told you I was Mac?

26:38.697 --> 26:39.891
Then you'd be a ghost.

26:40.532 --> 26:41.692
Yeah.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.368
I don't think ghosts
get dropped with a right.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.531
I'm not sure if that's
ever been proven...

26:50.609 --> 26:52.440
but I'm not gonna
argue with you.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.650
Lieutenant
Neville Thompson, NIA?

27:01.920 --> 27:04.718
Couldn't tell you
the other night.
I was operating undercover.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.320
As Father Jim?

27:08.393 --> 27:10.657
Yeah, collecting money
for the Navy Relief Fund.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.421
Got nearly $800, too.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.123
What were you
really doing?

27:16.301 --> 27:20.135
Trying to build my credibility
as Father Jim, the friendly
Navy chaplain.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.800
Thought you were trying
to blow my cover...

27:22.875 --> 27:24.775
till I checked
your story out.

27:25.344 --> 27:26.868
It's a hell
of a coincidence...

27:26.945 --> 27:30.312
me looking like your buddy
and you being
an ex-NIA officer, huh?

27:30.382 --> 27:31.474
Yeah.
Sorry...

27:31.783 --> 27:32.772
Neville.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.612
Yeah, well...

27:35.487 --> 27:36.749
I understand.

27:41.827 --> 27:44.955
I just can't get over
how much you look
like my friend Mac.

27:45.531 --> 27:46.862
He was a real buddy,
huh?

27:46.932 --> 27:48.126
The best.

27:49.768 --> 27:51.065
Look...

27:51.303 --> 27:53.999
you wanna call me
Mac, it's okay.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.675
I couldn't do that.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.479
I use so many
different names
on this job already...

28:01.547 --> 28:03.674
one more is not gonna
make any difference.

28:03.749 --> 28:05.649
Really, it's okay.

28:07.252 --> 28:08.446
Thanks...

28:11.490 --> 28:12.582
Mac.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.953
Now...

28:17.029 --> 28:19.930
the reason
I came to see you is,
I need your help.

28:24.403 --> 28:25.893
He's just sitting there...

28:27.706 --> 28:29.071
talking to the lads.

28:29.141 --> 28:30.540
That doesn't
sound good.

28:30.809 --> 28:32.572
What's wrong with
talking to the lads?

28:32.644 --> 28:35.044
Nothing, as long as
you don't think
they talk back.

28:36.448 --> 28:38.712
The lads are
excellent listeners.

28:39.918 --> 28:41.112
Excellent.

28:41.386 --> 28:42.819
They may be Marine pilots...

28:42.888 --> 28:44.879
but most of them are just kids
in their early 20s...

28:44.957 --> 28:46.390
and those slicks
in Little Saigon...

28:46.458 --> 28:48.517
are taking them
in a crooked poker game.

28:48.594 --> 28:50.528
So, I'm supposed
to raid it...

28:50.729 --> 28:52.196
pretending to be
Shore Patrol?

28:52.264 --> 28:54.494
Right, right.
And I'll be
on the inside.

28:55.133 --> 28:56.498
As Father Jim.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.863
No, no, no,
as Lieutenant Briggs.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.105
A pilot in the squadron
who's loaded.

29:01.173 --> 29:02.367
Lieutenant Briggs?

29:02.441 --> 29:03.567
Right!

29:03.642 --> 29:05.610
Right!
Do you think the Vietnamese
running this game...

29:05.677 --> 29:07.611
would believe in a priest
playing high-stakes poker?

29:07.679 --> 29:09.738
I suppose not.
You can bet not.

29:09.815 --> 29:12.249
So the Marines told them
I was Lieutenant Briggs.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.544
So the Marines think
you're Father Jim.

29:15.254 --> 29:16.448
Right.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.384
They wouldn't have
even told me
about the poker game...

29:19.458 --> 29:20.789
if they'd thought
I was an NIA officer.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.952
Gambling's
a court-martial offense.

29:24.730 --> 29:26.755
Yeah, but I still
don't get it...

29:26.832 --> 29:27.821
Mac.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.960
I mean, why not use
the real Shore Patrol?

29:31.036 --> 29:32.560
Look, I don't know
how you felt about it...

29:32.638 --> 29:34.765
when you were
with the NIA, but...

29:34.840 --> 29:38.071
I figure it's my job
to help our boys,
not to punish them <i>and...</i>

29:38.143 --> 29:39.701
I mean, if we're talking
about drugs...

29:39.778 --> 29:42.713
or stolen government
property or something,
that's different. But...

29:43.982 --> 29:46.348
Getting ripped off
in a crooked poker <i>game...</i>

29:47.119 --> 29:50.247
The way I see it,
if I can get those kids
their money back...

29:50.322 --> 29:52.620
and not make it official,
who does it hurt?

29:53.458 --> 29:54.755
I guess nobody.

29:55.360 --> 29:56.884
Except the yahoos
running the game.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.190
Right!

29:58.463 --> 30:01.398
Now, there's a head
next to that poker room.

30:01.533 --> 30:04.969
Between 2200 and 2215,
I'll excuse myself
to use it.

30:05.871 --> 30:08.431
<i>At 2230, you crawl</i>
<i>through that window...</i>

30:09.708 --> 30:12.506
<i>dd</i>

30:15.881 --> 30:16.870
Open with $10.

30:17.916 --> 30:19.315
I'll call.

30:20.786 --> 30:23.277
I'll see your $10,
and raise you $20.

30:27.926 --> 30:30.224
I'll see your $20,
and raise you $20.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.558
I'll see that...

30:35.033 --> 30:36.500
and raise $30.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.731
Nah. Too much for me.

30:40.806 --> 30:42.671
I'm game. Call.

30:44.042 --> 30:45.839
Well, let's make it
interesting, then.

30:45.911 --> 30:48.436
I'll see your $30
and raise $50.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.516
I'll see that,
and $100 more.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.251
I'm in! Call.

30:54.319 --> 30:58.119
I'll see your $100,
bump you $100.

30:58.523 --> 30:59.581
It's your money.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.684
<i>When Mac said a big-stakes</i>
<i>poker game, he wasn't kidding.</i>

31:02.761 --> 31:04.752
<i>There were thousands</i>
<i>on that table.</i>

31:05.163 --> 31:07.654
<i>Marine pilots don't usually</i>
<i>have that kind of money...</i>

31:07.733 --> 31:09.792
<i>and that should have been</i>
<i>a warning to me...</i>

31:09.968 --> 31:13.062
<i>but Mac was in there</i>
<i>counting on me and, besides...</i>

31:13.338 --> 31:14.703
<i>it was 2230.</i>

31:14.773 --> 31:16.035
How many cards?

31:16.341 --> 31:17.535
Two for me.

31:18.009 --> 31:18.998
I'll take one.

31:19.277 --> 31:21.370
Freeze!
Hey! What the heck!

31:21.446 --> 31:22.504
Please.

31:24.483 --> 31:25.950
Great work, Lieutenant!

31:28.687 --> 31:31.212
You're under arrest
for operating
a gambling establishment...

31:31.289 --> 31:33.052
catering to
Armed Forces personnel.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.423
Sorry I had to
deceive you men.

31:36.595 --> 31:38.859
I'm Commander Brodrick
of the Shore Patrol.

31:38.930 --> 31:40.864
I'm afraid you'll all
have to stand court-martial.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.695
Lieutenant,
where are your men?

31:42.768 --> 31:43.962
Out front, sir.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.062
Good.

31:47.939 --> 31:49.372
I'll go down
and get them.

31:49.975 --> 31:51.374
Wait!

31:53.111 --> 31:55.102
<i>There comes a time</i>
<i>in everyone's life...</i>

31:55.180 --> 31:56.841
<i>when they know</i>
<i>they've been had.</i>

31:56.915 --> 31:58.280
<i>This was mine.</i>

31:58.350 --> 32:00.841
<i>The only chance I had</i>
<i>of getting to the street</i>
<i>in one piece...</i>

32:00.919 --> 32:02.216
<i>was to play out the hand.</i>

32:02.454 --> 32:03.819
<i>No pun intended.</i>

32:03.889 --> 32:06.357
Okay, back up.

32:09.327 --> 32:10.692
When <i>Commander...</i>

32:11.963 --> 32:14.625
When the Commander gets back
with his men...

32:15.133 --> 32:16.760
I want you Marines
to have your ID ready.

32:16.835 --> 32:18.359
We're gonna have to
book you boys at Pearl.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.962
You people will be
turned over to Five-O.

32:21.306 --> 32:23.331
And the ladies...

32:23.809 --> 32:25.674
Freeze!
Shore Patrol!

32:28.447 --> 32:31.541
You know, you people
didn't have to break in.
I already had them in custody.

32:34.920 --> 32:37.354
I'm going to go downstairs
and check on the Commander.
Well done.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.889
Just a minute, sir.
What?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.219
Who are you?

32:40.492 --> 32:41.789
Who am I?

32:42.761 --> 32:43.785
Who am I?

32:43.862 --> 32:45.489
His name's Magnum.

32:47.332 --> 32:48.959
And the question's not
who he is...

32:49.034 --> 32:53.095
but what's he doing
posing as a Naval officer
in an illegal gambling house?

32:59.910 --> 33:02.003
They claim there was
no one else in that game.

33:02.079 --> 33:05.207
Well, of course they do.
Those Marine pilots
think he's Father Jim...

33:05.282 --> 33:06.977
a Navy chaplain
trying to help them.

33:07.051 --> 33:08.518
They're not gonna
get him in trouble.

33:08.586 --> 33:09.883
And the Vietnamese?

33:09.954 --> 33:11.581
He took all the money
from the table.

33:11.655 --> 33:13.953
If he doesn't exist,
then the money
doesn't exist...

33:14.024 --> 33:16.891
and you can't charge him
with operating
a gambling casino.

33:18.295 --> 33:19.785
I checked out your...

33:19.863 --> 33:21.421
Lieutenant Neville Thompson.

33:21.498 --> 33:23.796
There's no record of anybody
by that name in NIA...

33:23.867 --> 33:26.233
or, for that matter,
in the US Navy.

33:26.303 --> 33:28.794
Mac was conning me.
He's not gonna use
his real name.

33:28.872 --> 33:29.861
"Mac"?

33:29.940 --> 33:32.204
Well, what do you want me
to call him? John Doe?

33:32.276 --> 33:33.641
And there's something
I'd like to know.

33:33.711 --> 33:35.406
What are you doing
on a gambling raid?

33:35.479 --> 33:37.276
That isn't
of any Interest to NIA.

33:37.348 --> 33:40.476
It is if the pilots involved
are flying F-18s.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.348
Duc-Ho, who runs that place...

33:42.419 --> 33:44.546
wouldn't be
beyond swapping IOUs...

33:44.622 --> 33:46.783
for a copy
of an operations manual.

33:47.124 --> 33:48.785
Those kids didn't.
No.

33:48.926 --> 33:52.157
Despite what they're flying,
they're just a little wet
behind the ears.

33:52.396 --> 33:54.887
All Duc-Ho got out of them
was their money.

33:56.266 --> 33:57.824
Who tipped you
to the card game?

33:57.901 --> 34:01.337
NIA got a call
from someone in Little Saigon.
It happens all the time.

34:01.405 --> 34:02.565
Mac.

34:02.673 --> 34:05.107
Now, that's the second time
you've called him Mac!

34:05.175 --> 34:07.405
Magnum, you're not
telling me everything!

34:08.178 --> 34:09.839
Are you going to
charge me or not?

34:14.184 --> 34:16.083
Hell, I figure you
impersonated an officer...

34:16.152 --> 34:18.143
all the time
you were in the Navy.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.121
I guess once more
didn't matter.

34:21.525 --> 34:25.085
The duty yeoman
will arrange transportation
back to your car.

34:28.331 --> 34:29.924
What are you
up to, Buck?

34:30.501 --> 34:32.196
This isn't like you
to let me off.

34:32.569 --> 34:36.300
I'm doing it
because I don't want to spend
my Saturday typing up charges.

34:36.373 --> 34:38.500
But if you insist
on being charged...

34:38.574 --> 34:40.132
No, no. No.
...I'll be happy
to oblige you.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.438
It's not necessary.

34:43.981 --> 34:46.074
And thank you, Colonel.

34:55.559 --> 34:56.786
<i>It was a nightmare.</i>

34:56.860 --> 35:00.819
<i>No matter</i>
<i>how many times I saw Mac,</i>
<i>I couldn't prove he existed.</i>

35:01.031 --> 35:02.396
<i>None of my friends</i>
<i>had seen him...</i>

35:02.466 --> 35:04.593
<i>and the people who did</i>
<i>wouldn't admit it.</i>

35:04.668 --> 35:07.535
<i>I couldn't blame Higgins</i>
<i>or the guys for thinking</i>
<i>I was hallucinating.</i>

35:07.604 --> 35:09.504
<i>Hell, I even began to wonder.</i>

35:09.573 --> 35:12.508
<i>So there was no way</i>
<i>I was going to tell</i>
<i>Buck Greene, or anyone else...</i>

35:12.576 --> 35:13.873
<i>what was going on.</i>

35:13.944 --> 35:15.343
<i>Not until I found Mac.</i>

35:15.412 --> 35:16.709
<i>Or someone who knew him.</i>

35:16.780 --> 35:17.769
<i>Or...</i>

35:27.791 --> 35:29.452
Sure, I can pick him out.

35:29.793 --> 35:31.090
Yeah, that's Father Jim.

35:31.161 --> 35:33.425
He's got a mustache now,
but that's him.

35:33.697 --> 35:35.892
Came in collecting
for Navy Relief.

35:36.400 --> 35:39.028
Now, most of my customers
are tourists, <i>but...</i>

35:39.103 --> 35:40.627
What the hell,
I was in the service.

35:40.704 --> 35:42.831
I know how tough it is
on you guys.

35:43.674 --> 35:44.902
I gave him $50.

35:44.975 --> 35:47.500
Hey, that's great.
Do you know
where I can reach him?

35:48.178 --> 35:49.839
You kidding,
Lieutenant?

35:49.913 --> 35:52.848
Pearl Harbor.
Where else you gonna find
a Navy chaplain?

35:54.151 --> 35:55.140
Yeah.

35:55.219 --> 35:56.413
Why didn't I think of that?

35:56.487 --> 35:57.545
Thanks.
Yeah.

35:57.621 --> 35:59.646
Hey, Lieutenant,
don't you want
some ice cream?

35:59.723 --> 36:02.089
We got a special
on a hot fudge sundae.

36:02.993 --> 36:04.961
<i>We don't allow food</i>
<i>in the store.</i>

36:05.562 --> 36:07.120
Oh. Sorry.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.726
If I let you do it,
I'd have to let everyone.

36:10.901 --> 36:13.267
And with that
ice cream parlor
right next door...

36:13.337 --> 36:14.565
I understand.

36:16.206 --> 36:18.174
Do you recognize
the guy on the left?

36:18.442 --> 36:19.966
I believe
that's Father Jim.

36:20.377 --> 36:21.469
It is.

36:21.545 --> 36:23.945
I didn't know
they allowed priests
to wear shirts like that.

36:24.014 --> 36:25.447
Oh, only when
they're off duty.

36:25.516 --> 36:27.882
Was he in here
collecting for Navy Relief?

36:27.951 --> 36:30.977
Yes, Thursday morning.
I donated $100.

36:34.057 --> 36:35.649
Is something wrong?

36:36.627 --> 36:38.754
No. No.
He's just an old friend...

36:38.829 --> 36:41.764
and I was told
he was in Waikiki
collecting for the fund...

36:41.832 --> 36:45.268
and I was hoping to find him
before my plane
left for Tokyo. Thank you.

36:46.103 --> 36:49.163
If your plane
isn't leaving before 3:00,
you can meet him here...

36:49.239 --> 36:50.797
when he picks up
his watch.

37:31.315 --> 37:32.976
I call her Olga.

37:34.585 --> 37:36.519
I don't know
her real name.

37:36.920 --> 37:39.912
But who can be sure
of anybody's real name
these days?

37:41.124 --> 37:43.786
Magnum. Boy, am I glad
to see you!

37:44.328 --> 37:45.488
Really?

37:46.597 --> 37:48.292
Did you know
that the real Shore Patrol...

37:48.365 --> 37:49.957
raided that joint
right after we left?

37:50.033 --> 37:51.864
After you left.

37:52.469 --> 37:55.563
Well, now, I don't blame you
for being upset,
but I can explain.

37:55.639 --> 37:57.630
Only not here,
because I'm being followed.

37:57.708 --> 38:00.040
Look, why don't I meet you
at this little place
called Al's?

38:00.110 --> 38:01.168
It's at the corner of...

38:03.313 --> 38:04.974
No more meeting places!

38:05.048 --> 38:07.710
No more phony IDs!
No more bull!

38:07.784 --> 38:09.911
I want answers!
And I wanna give them to you.

38:09.987 --> 38:12.012
Now, who the hell are you?
My name's Jim Bonick.

38:12.089 --> 38:13.920
I was a Navy jet jock
till I lost a canopy...

38:14.024 --> 38:16.515
Oh!
...at Angels 50
and my eardrums burst!

38:16.860 --> 38:18.259
It's the truth!

38:24.001 --> 38:26.970
I could never fly again,
so I got out.

38:27.971 --> 38:29.836
The last couple of months
before my separation...

38:29.907 --> 38:31.204
they assigned me
a desk at NIA.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.641
And that's how
I checked your story out.
I called some old friends.

38:33.710 --> 38:36.907
And now you're going to
hand me some phony ID
with Jim Bonick's name on it.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.242
Are you crazy?

38:38.315 --> 38:41.842
Doing what I do for a living,
you think I'd carry
my real ID on me?

38:42.252 --> 38:43.480
See? That proves
I'm Jim Bonick!

38:43.553 --> 38:45.953
I don't have any ID on me
with that name on it!

38:46.189 --> 38:47.918
That doesn't
prove anything!

38:48.425 --> 38:51.087
What do you do
for a living? Rip off
the Navy Relief Fund?

38:51.161 --> 38:54.221
Hold up high-stakes
poker games and leave guys
like me holding the bag?

38:54.298 --> 38:56.425
I took the bag.
You know what I mean!

38:56.500 --> 38:58.092
Well, what did I do
that was so wrong?

38:58.168 --> 39:00.398
What did you do
that was so wrong?

39:00.470 --> 39:01.767
You're a
rip-off artist!

39:01.838 --> 39:03.237
You're a conman
and a thief!

39:03.307 --> 39:04.365
I am not a thief!

39:04.708 --> 39:05.834
You're not <i>a...</i>

39:11.815 --> 39:13.510
You're not a thief?
No.

39:13.583 --> 39:14.811
You're not a thief?

39:14.885 --> 39:15.977
No.

39:16.053 --> 39:18.988
Did Navy Relief get the money
you collected? Huh?

39:19.056 --> 39:21.456
Twenty-five percent.

39:21.658 --> 39:23.057
Which is more
than they would have gotten...

39:23.126 --> 39:25.492
from a professional
fund-raising company!

39:26.563 --> 39:28.463
What about the card game?

39:28.565 --> 39:31.056
That money was already
ripped off from those pilots.

39:31.134 --> 39:32.999
All I did
was liberate it
from thieves.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.833
Liberate it?
That's right, liberate it!

39:34.905 --> 39:36.702
Come on, come on!
Give me another one.

39:38.909 --> 39:41.503
Did those pilots
get their money back?

39:41.712 --> 39:44.704
Well, now, I couldn't
very well do that, could I?

39:44.781 --> 39:46.578
They're being held
on suspicion of gambling.

39:46.650 --> 39:49.312
If I show up
to give them money back
they lost in a poker game...

39:49.386 --> 39:50.580
It would...
It would...

39:50.821 --> 39:52.288
prove they were gambling...

39:52.356 --> 39:55.553
and you're only keeping it
to save them from being
court-martialed.

39:56.126 --> 39:58.117
I'm glad
you finally understand.

39:59.096 --> 40:00.461
It doesn't matter.

40:00.530 --> 40:01.622
All that matters...

40:01.698 --> 40:05.134
is that Rick and Higgins
and T.C. Meet you!
Who's that?

40:05.202 --> 40:07.670
They're three guys
that think I made you up!

40:08.271 --> 40:10.466
And you know something?
Right now I'm hoping
they're right!

40:11.541 --> 40:13.441
I told you
I was being followed!

40:15.512 --> 40:17.605
Great.
This is all I need.

40:21.184 --> 40:22.208
Wait!

40:26.990 --> 40:28.150
Where's the money?

40:29.192 --> 40:31.592
Money?
The money
you stole from them.

40:32.229 --> 40:33.787
I don't know.
Where'd you put it?

40:45.675 --> 40:47.074
I'm going to
give you to them...

40:47.144 --> 40:49.738
Okay, okay, okay.
It's in the trunk.

40:50.047 --> 40:51.412
It's not in the trunk!

40:51.481 --> 40:53.381
It's in the front trunk!

40:54.484 --> 40:57.681
Look,
if we give them the money,
they're gonna kill us!

40:57.788 --> 40:59.483
Our only chance
is to jump them.

41:02.225 --> 41:03.419
The money.

41:09.533 --> 41:10.898
It's in the trunk.

41:11.768 --> 41:12.826
It's not in the trunk.

41:12.903 --> 41:14.234
You heard him.
It's under the bonnet.

41:14.304 --> 41:15.293
Bonnet?

41:15.372 --> 41:16.964
The front trunk!

41:26.983 --> 41:29.315
I have to release it
from the inside.

41:39.529 --> 41:40.860
It's under
the spare tire.

41:44.935 --> 41:46.095
Now what?

41:46.970 --> 41:48.096
I'm a black belt.

41:48.171 --> 41:51.038
You take the guys
on your side, I'll take
the guys on mine.

42:00.817 --> 42:01.909
Mac!

42:42.392 --> 42:43.825
Magnum, you okay?

42:45.028 --> 42:47.360
What happened to
"I'll take the guys
on my side"?

42:47.430 --> 42:49.398
There weren't
any guys on my side.

42:49.866 --> 42:51.959
When Magnum said
he was being conned...

42:52.035 --> 42:55.027
by somebody
posing as an NIA officer...

42:55.105 --> 42:57.164
and he kept calling him Mac...

42:57.541 --> 42:58.803
I figured
it was you.

42:58.875 --> 43:00.843
You know him?
Hell, yes.

43:01.811 --> 43:05.008
He's a Naval pilot
who got a medical discharge
<i>for...</i>

43:05.081 --> 43:07.049
Busted eardrums.
That was it.

43:07.751 --> 43:10.117
Uncanny the way he looks
like Mac, isn't it?

43:10.587 --> 43:11.679
Yeah.

43:12.055 --> 43:14.285
Gave me goose bumps
the first time
I saw him.

43:15.258 --> 43:19.354
He was assigned to NIA
while his discharge
was being processed.

43:20.730 --> 43:23.927
Always had some con
or another going.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.168
If he hadn't gotten
the medical...

43:26.236 --> 43:27.999
he'd have ended up
in Leavenworth.

43:28.071 --> 43:30.062
Well, now, Colonel,
that's just not fair.

43:30.140 --> 43:32.074
The hell it isn't, Travis.

43:32.242 --> 43:33.573
Travis?

43:34.244 --> 43:36.712
Lieutenant Joe Travis.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.145
That's your buddy's real name.

43:47.324 --> 43:48.586
<i>After Mac agreed...</i>

43:48.658 --> 43:51.149
<i>to file charges with me</i>
<i>against Duc-Ho and his boys...</i>

43:51.228 --> 43:52.695
<i>Buck let us go.</i>

43:52.929 --> 43:57.195
<i>Outside, Mac quickly explained</i>
<i>that he'd lied to the Navy</i>
<i>about his name.</i>

43:57.400 --> 43:59.231
<i>He insisted</i>
<i>that he'd told me the truth...</i>

43:59.302 --> 44:01.133
<i>that his real name</i>
<i>was Jim Bonick.</i>

44:01.204 --> 44:02.728
<i>It seems he and a friend</i>
<i>named Travis...</i>

44:02.806 --> 44:04.273
<i>had switched names</i>
<i>in Pensacola...</i>

44:04.341 --> 44:06.571
<i>in some elaborate scheme</i>
<i>to avoid duty watches...</i>

44:06.643 --> 44:09.544
<i>and he'd ended up commissioned</i>
<i>with Travis's name.</i>

44:10.747 --> 44:12.908
<i>I didn't care</i>
<i>if it was true or not.</i>

44:13.149 --> 44:15.447
<i>All that mattered</i>
<i>was that I wasn't crazy.</i>

44:15.518 --> 44:17.884
<i>I wasn't hallucinating,</i>
<i>there were no ghosts...</i>

44:17.954 --> 44:20.582
<i>and I could finally</i>
<i>prove that to my friends.</i>

44:27.597 --> 44:29.189
Hi, guys.

44:29.699 --> 44:30.859
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

44:30.934 --> 44:32.128
We've had Five-O
scouring the <i>island...</i>

44:32.202 --> 44:33.567
We were searching
the morgue,
the hospital, <i>the...</i>

44:33.937 --> 44:35.063
What are you doing
in that uniform?

44:35.138 --> 44:36.162
Wait!

44:38.108 --> 44:40.542
I know you all think
I'm crazy.

44:40.610 --> 44:41.838
Oh, no, well,
I didn't mean to <i>imply...</i>

44:41.911 --> 44:44.379
Well, I didn't say
you were crazy.
What I really meant <i>was...</i>

44:47.884 --> 44:49.317
I don't blame you.

44:50.320 --> 44:53.585
Circumstantial evidence
would lead anyone
to believe...

44:53.657 --> 44:55.716
that I had been
hallucinating.

44:57.260 --> 44:58.750
Or had seen a ghost.

45:01.464 --> 45:02.931
Well, my friends...

45:04.234 --> 45:06.794
I have absolute...

45:07.003 --> 45:08.527
living proof...

45:08.772 --> 45:10.603
that neither is the case.

45:13.176 --> 45:14.666
Come on in, Mac!

45:26.456 --> 45:27.582
Mac?

45:46.209 --> 45:47.801
Oh, my God.

45:49.379 --> 45:50.778
Hiya, fellows.

47:15.198 --> 47:16.460
The mustache!

47:32.348 --> 47:34.748
Well, what's wrong, Magnum?
You look like
you've seen a ghost.
