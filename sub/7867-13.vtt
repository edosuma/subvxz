00:22.552 --> 00:27.427
For centuries, man has been
ruled by science and industry,

00:27.451 --> 00:30.382
but that era is drawing to a close.

00:35.487 --> 00:38.152
We stand on the cusp of a new epoch.

00:38.176 --> 00:42.537
One of prophecy, puzzles,
and signs in the sky.

00:45.163 --> 00:48.160
And that epoch begins today.

00:48.521 --> 00:53.720
Our top story: Today, Springfield will
experience a rare total eclipse of the sun.

00:53.744 --> 00:56.660
A solar eclipse is like a woman
breast-feeding in a restaurant.

00:56.684 --> 01:00.323
It's free, it's beautiful, but under
no circumstances should you look at it.

01:00.347 --> 01:03.304
We recommend using
a home-made camera-obscurer

01:03.328 --> 01:06.378
fashioned from an ordinary
shoebox and paper towel tube.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.872
This was supposed to be pre-made.

01:08.896 --> 01:10.541
Fine, I'll do it myself.

01:10.565 --> 01:12.830
Where is the end of the friggin' tape?

01:12.854 --> 01:14.290
Forget it! We'll do it next week!

01:14.314 --> 01:15.455
The eclipse is today.

01:15.479 --> 01:17.925
There's an eclipse
when I say there's an eclipse!

01:51.310 --> 01:55.828
Okay, people. We've hit penumbra.
Brace yourself for umbra!

01:55.863 --> 01:56.667
I'm gonna see it first!

01:56.702 --> 01:58.128
No! I'm gonna see it first!

01:58.163 --> 02:00.293
Hit the road, you big load!

02:00.328 --> 02:04.011
My space toy!

02:04.870 --> 02:08.536
It's okay, Homie. You can have my viewer.

02:08.571 --> 02:10.601
But Mom, you'll miss the eclipse!

02:10.636 --> 02:13.973
There'll be another one
in North Yemen in 2027.

02:14.474 --> 02:17.100
We have totality, people!

02:17.609 --> 02:19.409
Wow.

02:19.444 --> 02:22.952
We'll be talking about this
together for years.

02:23.072 --> 02:24.554
For years.

02:24.589 --> 02:27.596
I finally feel like part of a family.

02:28.084 --> 02:29.385
I can't miss out!

02:29.505 --> 02:34.590
Just one little peek. It's beautiful.

02:38.452 --> 02:42.794
Now, Marge, your eyes must stay
completely covered for two full weeks.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.792
Don't worry, honey.
I'll be your seeing-eye Homer.

02:45.827 --> 02:48.845
We're in some kind of doctor room,
bunch of stuff on the walls.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.572
It's kinda hard to describe.

02:50.607 --> 02:52.214
I'm gonna take my break now.

02:52.979 --> 02:54.838
Now Simpsons, I must warn you.

02:54.873 --> 02:58.359
Any stress could increase
the blood pressure in Marge's eyeballs,

02:58.479 --> 03:01.665
leading to what we call Tex Avery Syndrome.

03:12.412 --> 03:14.364
Wolves are taking all our women!

03:17.558 --> 03:20.247
You guys have treated me like a princess!

03:20.282 --> 03:23.298
Everyday's been like
the first ten minutes of Mother's Day.

03:23.418 --> 03:26.673
You just rest those rods
and coddle those cones.

03:26.793 --> 03:28.569
Everything's taken care of.

03:29.383 --> 03:31.172
Dad, come in the kitchen quick.

03:31.207 --> 03:33.190
Is there any other way to enter a kitchen?

03:38.025 --> 03:42.680
Rats in the kitchen! Just like that
delightful movie I taped in the theatre.

03:46.924 --> 03:48.785
He's controlling me with my hair!

03:48.820 --> 03:52.865
Using me to cook a delicious
sole meunière with a celery root purée,

03:52.985 --> 03:54.453
And carrots vichy.

03:59.772 --> 04:00.828
This is good.

04:02.014 --> 04:03.287
Good, but not great.

04:03.407 --> 04:04.831
I'll go get some rat poison.

04:12.242 --> 04:16.168
Here you go. This'll kill those
dirty rats, and the clean ones, too.

04:17.815 --> 04:19.124
That's not candy, sweetheart.

04:19.244 --> 04:22.567
What is it with kids
and candy-colored poison, huh?

04:26.568 --> 04:28.797
No, you stupid dog! That's Maggie's bunny!

04:29.702 --> 04:31.534
Not in front of the poison man.

04:31.569 --> 04:33.772
Whoever is biting me, stop it!

04:37.872 --> 04:41.303
Why did I bring the baby
and the dog to the poison store?

04:46.087 --> 04:49.381
How am I gonna get us all across this river?

04:50.345 --> 04:51.157
A boat!

04:55.678 --> 04:56.594
We're too heavy.

04:58.596 --> 05:02.302
Let's see. I need to get the baby,
the dog and the poison across the river,

05:02.337 --> 05:04.260
but I can only take one thing at a time.

05:04.295 --> 05:06.729
I can't leave
the baby alone with the poison,

05:06.764 --> 05:09.066
and I can't leave
the dog alone with the baby.

05:10.028 --> 05:12.812
Can't someone help me with this puzzle?

05:14.148 --> 05:16.741
Professor Frink, help me figure this out!

05:18.044 --> 05:19.759
Yo, over here!

05:26.428 --> 05:28.531
Great time to nap, Einstein!

05:32.343 --> 05:36.002
Okay. Maggie, dog, poison.
You're all involved, so listen up.

05:36.527 --> 05:39.554
First, I row Maggie over,
leaving the dog and the poison.

05:39.589 --> 05:42.730
Then I row back alone,
take the poison over, and bring Maggie back.

05:42.765 --> 05:45.067
Then I take the dog over,
come back, get Maggie,

05:45.102 --> 05:48.582
row across, and before I know it,
I'm back at home.

05:53.989 --> 05:55.603
Were you listening at all?

05:59.104 --> 06:06.188
Sir, I'd be obliged to you if you'd help me
puzzle out my fox, duck and corn situation.

06:07.443 --> 06:11.200
Well, the puzzle done puzzled itself out.

06:13.514 --> 06:16.005
Now I need to leave you
where you'll be safe.

06:16.040 --> 06:18.305
Under the watchful eyes of God.

06:18.340 --> 06:22.648
And I'll be watching you too in case God's
busy making tornadoes or not existing.

06:22.683 --> 06:24.083
I see you!

06:24.118 --> 06:26.285
I see you!

06:26.320 --> 06:27.733
I see--

06:28.166 --> 06:31.407
Look at that.
One of God's discarded miracles.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.744
Catholics!

06:36.770 --> 06:38.706
Give me my baby back!

06:38.741 --> 06:41.262
Sir, our mission is quite clear!

06:41.297 --> 06:45.581
"Any child left here will be
cared for by the sisters of St. Teresa."

06:45.616 --> 06:48.854
Why would you leave such
a beautiful baby on our doorstep?

06:48.889 --> 06:52.140
'Cos she was fighting my dog,
and stealing my poison.

06:52.175 --> 06:55.582
Now give her back so I can
take her home to my rat-infested house!

06:55.617 --> 06:58.100
No! The poor dear is right
where she belongs!

06:58.135 --> 07:00.899
Come on, lady. Have a heart!

07:00.934 --> 07:03.587
I'm sure your husband
does stupid things sometimes.

07:03.622 --> 07:05.729
I'm married to Jesus!

07:05.764 --> 07:09.296
Yeah, right.
And I'm married to Wonder Woman!

07:11.080 --> 07:13.651
Kids, I have to tell your mom I lost Maggie.

07:13.686 --> 07:15.755
But Dr. Hibbert said not to stress her out.

07:15.790 --> 07:17.545
Wait, I have an idea.

07:17.580 --> 07:21.523
One of us can go undercover
as a nun, and infiltrate the convent.

07:21.558 --> 07:25.226
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.

07:25.261 --> 07:30.521
There is no way Homer Simpson's
gonna put on a dress, and act like a nun.

07:31.304 --> 07:32.686
Told you there was no way I would do it.

07:33.009 --> 07:34.332
Are you sure you don't want me to do it?

07:34.367 --> 07:35.243
'Cos I can do it.

07:35.905 --> 07:37.172
I got the outfit right here.

07:37.665 --> 07:40.407
Dad, leave so I can get into character.

07:49.011 --> 07:51.869
Hello. I'm a poor little sinner
who's lost her way.

07:51.904 --> 07:53.299
May I join your order?

07:53.334 --> 07:54.770
How do you feel about kneeling?

07:54.805 --> 07:55.631
Can't get enough.

07:55.666 --> 07:56.337
You're in.

07:57.836 --> 08:00.969
Finally, you must wear
your habit modestly at all times.

08:01.266 --> 08:02.797
Not like Sister Marilyn.

08:05.299 --> 08:06.265
The nursery.

08:07.285 --> 08:10.032
<i>If you're happy and you know it
That's a sin</i>

08:10.067 --> 08:13.235
<i>If you're happy and you know it
That's a sin</i>

08:13.504 --> 08:14.593
Where's Maggie?

08:15.156 --> 08:18.535
Mother Superior, are those
all the babies in our orphanage?

08:18.570 --> 08:20.671
Looking for more unwanted babies, are you?

08:20.706 --> 08:22.865
Well next week's nine months after the prom.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.581
They'll be stacked up to the ceiling.

08:24.616 --> 08:28.255
No, I was just thinking you might have
some in the back you haven't put out yet.

08:28.290 --> 08:29.858
Oh, a Doubting Thomas, are you?

08:30.218 --> 08:32.023
Well, more of a Curious George.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.264
Well, little monkey,

08:33.299 --> 08:36.226
it's time for you to spend some time
with the man in the yellow hat.

08:37.480 --> 08:41.236
Why would Mother Superior
lie to me about not having Maggie?

08:41.270 --> 08:43.309
What is going on?

08:45.830 --> 08:48.860
A jewel. Why would nuns want a jewel?

08:48.895 --> 08:52.747
Find the jewel. Find what you desire.

08:52.782 --> 08:55.046
The jewel'll lead me to my baby sister?

08:55.081 --> 08:56.566
Why are you telling me this?

08:56.601 --> 08:59.067
Because I'm sick of that Mother Superior.

08:59.102 --> 09:02.298
Whenever we play football,
she has to be quarterback.

09:09.353 --> 09:12.994
Now, you must solve a series of clues.

09:13.029 --> 09:16.270
You mean an increasingly difficult series
of challenges to my intellect?

09:16.305 --> 09:17.436
That's so cool.

09:17.471 --> 09:19.232
Plus, you'll find your sister.

09:19.267 --> 09:19.775
Oh, sure.

09:19.959 --> 09:20.941
Your first clue.

09:23.521 --> 09:28.672
And before you decide to become
a nun, consider this: I am only 23!

09:34.403 --> 09:37.188
"<i>Quaerite deum in corde et anima.</i>"

09:37.223 --> 09:37.986
That's Latin!

09:38.021 --> 09:41.007
<i>Deum</i> is God. And of course
<i>quaerite</i> means seek.

09:41.042 --> 09:44.100
"Seek God with heart and soul."

09:44.135 --> 09:49.222
<i>Heart and Soul</i>!

09:49.257 --> 09:56.495
<i>I fell in love with you heart and soul</i>

10:36.470 --> 10:38.749
Homie, I haven't held Maggie all day.

10:38.784 --> 10:39.863
Can you hand her to me?

10:40.796 --> 10:42.353
No problem, sweetie.

10:45.111 --> 10:48.281
Mommy's little baby
is getting big and chubby.

10:48.999 --> 10:50.599
Who's a chubby baby?

10:51.658 --> 10:54.139
But that doesn't mean
you can't have a little dinner.

10:57.237 --> 10:58.915
You're not usually this greedy.

11:01.106 --> 11:03.496
Cool it, she's getting suspicious.

11:03.531 --> 11:04.610
You cool it! I'm hungry!

11:13.357 --> 11:16.403
Cryptic message.
Maybe this will lead me to the gem.

11:17.425 --> 11:19.516
What if I read every other word?

11:19.551 --> 11:25.310
"One more time. Your hopeless.
Try again. Numb skull!"

11:25.345 --> 11:26.353
That's not very nice.

11:26.388 --> 11:29.578
I will try again,
but not because the wall told me to.

11:29.613 --> 11:34.782
"Turn around.
Seek Springfield's biggest man-made ring."

11:37.186 --> 11:40.495
Big ring. Big ring.

11:47.271 --> 11:51.836
So many rings. But which one
is the key to finding the gem?

11:57.584 --> 11:59.411
Well? Did you get it?

11:59.446 --> 12:03.267
No. I'm not a smart nerd.
I'm just a weak nerd.

12:03.302 --> 12:09.632
The biggest ring in Springfield comes
from the bell in the Springfield Bell Tower.

12:18.925 --> 12:22.658
Good night, Bart. I'll be right in, Lisa.

12:33.799 --> 12:35.419
Good night, Lisa.

12:36.511 --> 12:37.404
Good night!

12:40.130 --> 12:41.560
Jazz!

12:44.571 --> 12:45.678
Keep going, and I'll...

12:59.156 --> 13:01.544
Principal Skinner? Comic Book Guy?

13:01.579 --> 13:02.493
What are you doing here?

13:02.528 --> 13:05.984
Following you.
We seek the gem of St. Teresa.

13:06.840 --> 13:09.187
Well I seek it so I can find my sister.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.762
How do you know about the gem?

13:10.797 --> 13:13.333
We are an ancient order of mystery buffs

13:13.368 --> 13:17.945
who hide in shadow, and call
ourselves the Brethren of the Quest.

13:17.980 --> 13:20.845
Because we do our sleuthing
in Mother's Nissan Quest minivan.

13:20.880 --> 13:22.723
Tell me all you know about the gem.

13:22.758 --> 13:23.685
Never.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.902
Does your mother know
you're using her minivan?

13:25.937 --> 13:27.830
You see, legend has it that on her deathbed,

13:27.865 --> 13:30.608
St. Teresa of Avila had a vision of a jewel

13:30.643 --> 13:33.023
that would usher in
an era of peace and harmony.

13:34.072 --> 13:38.492
She dispatched a team of nuns
to the new world to seek this fabulous gem.

13:50.470 --> 13:52.573
They landed at what is now Philadelphia.

13:53.843 --> 13:57.215
And used the timbers of their ship
to construct a convent.

14:02.985 --> 14:06.534
The order flourished,
never forgetting its sacred mission.

14:06.793 --> 14:08.801
But word about the gem got out.

14:09.750 --> 14:12.332
And a group of
high-ranking freemasons led by

14:12.367 --> 14:15.303
Benjamin Franklin, George Washington
and King George III

14:15.338 --> 14:20.077
staged a phoney War of Independence
to cover their search for the gem.

14:31.145 --> 14:34.356
Fleeing the violence,
the nuns of St. Teresa's left the colonies,

14:34.391 --> 14:36.194
and settled here in Springfield.

14:37.388 --> 14:40.613
Legend and Wikipedia have it
that the gem will be revealed

14:40.648 --> 14:43.756
during the first full moon
after a solar eclipse.

14:43.791 --> 14:44.861
That's tonight!

14:46.287 --> 14:50.145
One question remains: Why did you come here?

14:50.180 --> 14:55.725
Because I cleverly deduce the answer
to Springfield's biggest ring. Voilà!

14:56.117 --> 15:01.194
Well, it gives me no pleasure to say,
your deduction was faulty!

15:03.927 --> 15:06.508
This is a fake papier-mâché bell.

15:06.543 --> 15:10.784
The real bell was melted down in
World War II to make Civil War chess sets.

15:10.819 --> 15:11.960
Four of which I own.

15:13.467 --> 15:17.476
Oh, my God! I know what
the biggest ring in Springfield is!

15:17.511 --> 15:19.946
It's been right in front of us
the whole time!

15:19.981 --> 15:21.764
Ah, yes, I see it.

15:22.316 --> 15:28.752
I see it too. Let's head that way.
We'll walk or drive to the obvious solution.

15:34.036 --> 15:35.677
Oh, the word ring.

15:43.369 --> 15:47.270
Well, well. If it isn't
the Tardy Boys and Nancy Clueless.

15:47.305 --> 15:49.771
Mr. Burns? What are you doing here?

15:50.288 --> 15:52.180
I've known about the gem for years.

15:52.215 --> 15:56.069
You see, my dear girl, I joined
the freemasons before it was trendy.

15:56.104 --> 15:58.214
That's my eyeball on the dollar bill.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.431
That's also my pyramid.

15:59.466 --> 16:03.585
Hence I trailed you on your quest
accompanied by my faithful albino.

16:03.620 --> 16:06.493
I keep telling you I'm not an albino!

16:06.528 --> 16:08.321
I just use a lot of sun block.

16:08.356 --> 16:10.680
Then why do I give you
all the albino holidays off?

16:12.061 --> 16:14.159
Look! There's writing on the R!

16:14.194 --> 16:16.386
Oh, everything is writing
to you young people.

16:16.421 --> 16:17.980
From this angle, they're words!

16:18.706 --> 16:25.385
"Great crimes kill holy sage!"

16:25.420 --> 16:28.234
"Great crimes kill holy sage?"
The puzzle is solved.

16:28.269 --> 16:30.112
We must warn the holy sage at once.

16:30.147 --> 16:31.676
No, that's not it.

16:31.711 --> 16:35.472
A secret message this awkwardly
worded is always an anagram.

16:35.507 --> 16:40.338
Fine. Then you unscramble those letters
to spell out the location of the gem

16:40.373 --> 16:43.818
while you two dig your own graves.

16:48.018 --> 16:50.440
Superman, I have believed in you for years.

16:50.560 --> 16:55.003
If you can hear me now, please come
help me dig this giant grave.

17:01.073 --> 17:05.703
So, the anagram spells,
"Regally, the rock gem is..."

17:08.082 --> 17:08.970
"Lisa?"

17:09.005 --> 17:11.990
So, the gem is inside you?

17:12.756 --> 17:14.848
Sir, stop! She is the gem.

17:15.580 --> 17:18.462
Of course. St. Teresa wouldn't be
interested in a mere bauble.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.931
Her greatest treasure
would be a pure young girl.

17:20.965 --> 17:22.963
You are pure, aren't you?

17:22.998 --> 17:24.414
Does kissing Milhouse count?

17:24.449 --> 17:25.849
No.

17:25.885 --> 17:30.237
It all adds up. I am the gem
that will bring world peace.

17:30.272 --> 17:34.911
How brilliant of God to remove
my scepticism by making me his chosen one!

17:34.946 --> 17:38.817
According to legend, the gem must be
brought to the convent by sunrise.

17:39.240 --> 17:41.790
We could make it if we
took Mr. Burns' helicopter.

17:42.934 --> 17:44.607
I don't really want you people inside,

17:44.642 --> 17:46.220
but you could dangle from the skids.

17:46.255 --> 17:46.842
Deal.

17:48.177 --> 17:49.948
Feels good to help someone, doesn't it, sir?

17:49.983 --> 17:52.612
No, it feels weird.

17:56.521 --> 18:00.918
<i>O Fortuna</i>

18:01.038 --> 18:02.550
Look who's here!

18:04.770 --> 18:09.312
<i>Velut luna</i>

18:09.347 --> 18:11.641
Oh, fine, fine. Finish your song.

18:11.676 --> 18:15.116
I can be patient.
After all, I am the gem child.

18:15.236 --> 18:17.736
Hush, you foolish girl.
The gem is over there!

18:20.754 --> 18:26.062
Maggie? No, no, no. The solution was,
"Regally, the rock gem is Lisa."

18:26.097 --> 18:30.022
Oh, please. How many sentences
start with the word regally?

18:30.663 --> 18:31.340
This one?

18:31.375 --> 18:32.803
Oh, give me that.

18:36.952 --> 18:40.082
"It's really Maggie, Sherlock."

18:40.117 --> 18:41.552
You know, I have to point out that

18:41.587 --> 18:44.407
this only makes sense
if I get the wrong answer first.

18:44.442 --> 18:45.767
I said, hush!

18:49.124 --> 18:53.659
Now begins a new era of
peace and prosperity for Springfield.

19:10.072 --> 19:12.463
Come on, man!
That's the fifth call you've missed today!

19:12.498 --> 19:13.772
That's it! You're outta...

19:19.027 --> 19:20.707
Just set it to "massage".

19:24.092 --> 19:28.913
Something tells me the gem of St. Teresa
has been returned to its throne.

19:30.933 --> 19:35.103
Maggie, it's true. You are the gem child!

19:35.138 --> 19:39.242
Four centuries of patient sacrifice
has finally paid off.

19:39.362 --> 19:41.208
All is peace and harmony.

19:41.777 --> 19:43.861
Give me my baby back!

19:43.896 --> 19:46.250
Mom! How did you know Maggie was here?

19:46.285 --> 19:47.876
A mother knows.

19:50.552 --> 19:53.481
Maggie, you're coming home with me.

19:53.516 --> 19:56.064
Mom, wait! Maggie is the gem child.

19:56.099 --> 19:57.933
She's brought peace to our town,

19:57.968 --> 20:00.748
and reports of less road rage
in Shelbyville.

20:00.783 --> 20:02.518
She has to stay here.

20:02.553 --> 20:08.018
Well, it would be nice if the
first thing I saw was a world at peace.

20:14.612 --> 20:18.016
You're even more beautiful
than I remembered.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.762
I'm sorry, but I know God
would never ask a mother

20:21.797 --> 20:24.920
to sacrifice her child
for the good of the world.

20:26.196 --> 20:27.085
Again.

20:30.134 --> 20:32.911
Maybe I'm just being selfish. I don't know.

20:33.147 --> 20:36.138
No, Marge. You're the most
giving person I know.

20:36.181 --> 20:41.501
Besides, I gave them another gem child
to sit on their precious throne.

20:41.536 --> 20:44.531
Step aside, ladies. I'm bringing the peace.

20:58.328 --> 21:01.076
I'm so staying up pass my bedtime.

21:02.305 --> 21:08.488
