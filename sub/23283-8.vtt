00:11.166 --> 00:13.417
- Ooh, those chicken wings

00:11.166 --> 00:13.417
smell amazing.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.709
- No. No. No.

00:15.750 --> 00:18.291
[laughter]

00:18.333 --> 00:19.792
No.

00:19.834 --> 00:21.542
- But you always give

00:19.834 --> 00:21.542
us a taste.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.750
- Not today.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.750
These are for Mr. Wigglesworth.

00:23.792 --> 00:25.750
He's my toughest critic,

00:23.792 --> 00:25.750
and if he likes them

00:25.792 --> 00:26.792
then I know they're good.

00:26.834 --> 00:30.250
- Hmm.

00:26.834 --> 00:30.250
Tell me more.

00:30.291 --> 00:33.709
- Well, I really want to enter

00:30.291 --> 00:33.709
the Colorado Kids Cook-Off,

00:33.750 --> 00:35.250
and I'm thinking of

00:33.750 --> 00:35.250
putting these on my menu.

00:35.291 --> 00:36.875
- Oh.

00:36.917 --> 00:37.917
Well, I hope he loves them.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.000
- I know we will.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.792
- At least savor them!

00:42.834 --> 00:45.083
- Savor what?

00:42.834 --> 00:45.083
Whoa!

00:45.125 --> 00:47.333
- Don't make me tong you.

00:47.375 --> 00:49.500
These are for Mr. Wigglesworth.

00:49.542 --> 00:52.750
- Oh, still worried about

00:49.542 --> 00:52.750
getting into that cook-off, huh?

00:52.792 --> 00:54.458
- Yep.

00:52.792 --> 00:54.458
It's a big deal.

00:54.500 --> 00:56.291
First prize is a one-week

00:54.500 --> 00:56.291
apprenticeship

00:56.333 --> 00:58.333
with Chef Andre.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.333
He is a local chef

00:58.375 --> 01:00.667
who owns Bistro Andre.

01:00.709 --> 01:03.083
- Wait, that's the hottest

01:00.709 --> 01:03.083
restaurant and nightclub

01:03.125 --> 01:04.875
in Boulder.

01:03.125 --> 01:04.875
So many famous singers

01:04.917 --> 01:07.834
got their start there,

01:04.917 --> 01:07.834
and Chef Andre's the one who

01:04.917 --> 01:07.834
picks them.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.834
I've always dreamed

01:07.875 --> 01:09.834
of singing there.

01:09.875 --> 01:11.458
- I've always dreamed

01:09.875 --> 01:11.458
of working there.

01:11.500 --> 01:13.875
To learn from Chef Andre

01:11.500 --> 01:13.875
would be incredible.

01:13.917 --> 01:15.458
- Indeed it would.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.500
- Hello, sir.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.500
I was actually hoping

01:17.542 --> 01:19.959
to get your opinion on these.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.792
- That smells...

01:20.000 --> 01:23.792
intriguing.

01:23.834 --> 01:27.625
- I call them, "Another Wing",

01:23.834 --> 01:27.625
because after you have one,

01:27.667 --> 01:29.542
you'll want another.

01:29.583 --> 01:32.250
- Eh, we'll see about that.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.625
Another.

01:36.667 --> 01:37.917
[together] Another!

01:37.959 --> 01:39.750
- Aah-aah-ahh!

01:39.792 --> 01:41.375
- This is the first time

01:39.792 --> 01:41.375
you've given me

01:41.417 --> 01:42.959
more than a, "hmm."

01:43.000 --> 01:45.375
- Do I know you?

01:43.000 --> 01:45.375
- Yeah, Nicky Harper.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.834
You usually hate

01:45.417 --> 01:47.834
everything I make.

01:47.875 --> 01:49.625
- Enter the cook-off.

01:49.667 --> 01:53.166
You have a great shot at

01:49.667 --> 01:53.166
winning a week in my kitchen.

01:53.208 --> 01:54.750
- Yes!

01:54.792 --> 01:56.792
Wait, your kitchen?

01:56.834 --> 01:58.959
Bistro Andre is

01:56.834 --> 01:58.959
Chef Andre's place.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.875
- Indeed it is.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.875
- Oh, there you are.

02:02.917 --> 02:07.917
I see you've met my brother,

02:02.917 --> 02:07.917
Chef Andre.

02:07.959 --> 02:10.709

- Chef Andre.

02:30.792 --> 02:33.500
Until four years ago,

02:33.542 --> 02:36.875
he was Abner Wigglesworth.

02:36.917 --> 02:39.792
- Wow, you are really identical.

02:39.834 --> 02:41.542

02:41.583 --> 02:43.542
I'm the talented one.

- Just because I dedicated

my life to teaching

doesn't mean I'm un-talented.

- No, it's your lack of talent

02:48.166 --> 02:52.375
that makes you un-talented.

02:52.417 --> 02:54.959
That's why you're judging

02:52.417 --> 02:54.959
the qualifying rounds

02:55.000 --> 02:56.750
and I'm judging the finals.

- And when one of

03:05.125 --> 03:07.250
my students wins,

03:07.291 --> 03:09.250
he'll have to admit

03:07.291 --> 03:09.250
my teaching has value.

03:09.291 --> 03:11.083
- Well, at least you have

03:09.291 --> 03:11.083
one student who might be able

03:11.125 --> 03:12.959
to win this thing.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.959
- Yes.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.166
- Please. He doesn't even

03:13.000 --> 03:15.166
have a sous chef.

04:25.291 --> 04:27.709
we can talk about:

04:27.750 --> 04:29.500
if Dawn's helping Nicky out,

04:29.542 --> 04:31.166
why did she have to change

04:29.542 --> 04:31.166
her name to Sue Chef?

04:31.208 --> 04:33.250
Shouldn't she just be Dawn Chef?

04:33.291 --> 04:35.000
- No, "sous" is French

04:33.291 --> 04:35.000
for "under."

04:35.041 --> 04:37.125
She's Nicky's under-chef.

- Oh, so in French,

04:37.166 --> 04:39.000
I'm wearing a pair

04:39.041 --> 04:41.709
of your sous-wear.

why don't we pretend

04:47.125 --> 04:48.792

06:21.709 --> 06:22.834
- [together] Now?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.750
- [together] Now.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.750
- How about tomorrow?

06:24.792 --> 06:25.750
- Tomorrow's perfect.

06:25.792 --> 06:26.750
- It's a date.

06:26.792 --> 06:28.500
[laughter]

06:28.542 --> 06:31.458
- We'd better get

06:28.542 --> 06:31.458
to our practices.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.375
- Whoa.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.375
You're not ready, dude.

06:34.417 --> 06:37.917
You don't want

06:34.417 --> 06:37.917
to embarrass yourself.

06:37.959 --> 06:42.125
Wait, how stupid do I look?

06:42.166 --> 06:42.875
I forgot my shoes.

06:42.917 --> 06:44.750
[laughter]

06:44.792 --> 06:49.000
- And your poetry journals!

06:49.041 --> 06:51.625
<i>♪♪</i>

06:51.667 --> 06:54.166
- Welcome to the

06:51.667 --> 06:54.166
qualifying round.

06:54.208 --> 06:58.250
The winner shall go on to the

06:54.208 --> 06:58.250
Colorado Kids Cook-Off finals

06:58.291 --> 07:00.375
and represent my class.

07:00.417 --> 07:05.041
Your challenge--

07:00.417 --> 07:05.041
the perfect omelet.

07:05.083 --> 07:08.041
Now, spatulas up,

07:05.083 --> 07:08.041
and cook.

07:08.083 --> 07:10.250
[laughter]

07:10.291 --> 07:11.333
- All right,

07:10.291 --> 07:11.333
you crack the eggs

07:11.375 --> 07:12.583
while I mince the scallions.

07:12.625 --> 07:14.250
- On it.

07:14.291 --> 07:17.583
[laughter]

07:17.625 --> 07:19.250
- Make sure you don't get

07:17.625 --> 07:19.250
any shells in there.

07:19.291 --> 07:22.542
[laughter]

07:22.583 --> 07:24.792
And don't forget to add salt.

07:24.834 --> 07:25.625
- Got it.

07:28.375 --> 07:30.208
[laughter]

07:30.250 --> 07:31.917
- Oh, but not too much salt

07:31.959 --> 07:34.041
[laughter]

07:34.083 --> 07:37.125
- Okay, salt has been added.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.000
- What are you doing?

07:39.041 --> 07:41.041
[laughter]

07:41.083 --> 07:43.000
Okay, if you want

07:41.083 --> 07:43.000
any chance of singing

07:43.041 --> 07:45.625
at Chef Andre's nightclub,

07:43.041 --> 07:45.625
you need to stay in your lane.

07:45.667 --> 07:47.208
- See, I'm just trying--

07:45.667 --> 07:47.208
- Stay in you lane!

07:47.250 --> 07:48.417
[laughter]

07:48.458 --> 07:50.000
- Okay, jeez.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.000
Chill.

07:50.041 --> 07:52.208
I feel like I'm walking

07:50.041 --> 07:52.208
on egg shells.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.875
- It's because you are.

07:53.917 --> 07:56.291
There are literally

07:53.917 --> 07:56.291
egg shells everywhere.

07:56.333 --> 08:00.375
[laughter]

08:00.417 --> 08:04.041
- Oh, superb spatula work,

08:00.417 --> 08:04.041
Flavio.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.375
[laughter]

08:06.417 --> 08:09.625
Hmph.

08:06.417 --> 08:09.625
[laughter]

08:09.667 --> 08:12.750
- "Hmph?"

08:09.667 --> 08:12.750
Wh-Why is he so hard on me?

08:12.792 --> 08:14.625
He's never gonna choose

08:12.792 --> 08:14.625
our omelet.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.625
- You know what?

08:14.667 --> 08:16.625
I think I have an idea

08:16.667 --> 08:18.667
of how to make this fair.

08:18.709 --> 08:20.542
So, Mr. Wigglesworth,

08:18.709 --> 08:20.542
uh, when do you

08:20.583 --> 08:22.166
when do you put

08:20.583 --> 08:22.166
on your blindfold?

08:22.208 --> 08:23.834
- What blindfold?

08:23.875 --> 08:25.375
Oh, I just thought you have

08:23.875 --> 08:25.375
such a refined palate

08:25.417 --> 08:27.542
that you can judge a dish

08:25.417 --> 08:27.542
without even seeing it.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.625
Oh, wait.

08:27.583 --> 08:30.625
That's your brother.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.208
- My palate is just

08:30.667 --> 08:32.208
as refined as his!

08:32.250 --> 08:36.291
Flavio, give me your sock!

08:32.250 --> 08:36.291
[laughter]

08:36.333 --> 08:37.667
I've come to a decision.

08:39.375 --> 08:41.667
This one is the clear winner.

08:41.709 --> 08:43.458
- [together] Yes!

08:41.709 --> 08:43.458
- Spatch-five.

08:43.500 --> 08:45.083
<i>[laughter]</i>

08:45.125 --> 08:47.333
- The Harpers?

08:47.375 --> 08:51.542
Sorry, Flavio.

08:51.583 --> 08:53.792
I hope this wasn't a fluke.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.500
- It wasn't.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.500
We won't let you down, sir.

08:55.542 --> 08:59.125
- Good, because the finals

08:55.542 --> 08:59.125
can be quite demanding.

08:59.166 --> 09:04.208
A full three-course meal in

08:59.166 --> 09:04.208
a very short amount of time.

09:04.250 --> 09:08.375
Therefore, you will be relying

09:04.250 --> 09:08.375
heavily on your sous chef.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.125
- Don't worry.

09:08.417 --> 09:11.125
We got this.

09:11.166 --> 09:13.250
Spatch-five.

09:13.291 --> 09:15.041
Whoa!

09:13.291 --> 09:15.041
[thud]

09:15.083 --> 09:17.166
[laughter]

09:17.208 --> 09:18.667
- Fork, Flavio!

09:18.709 --> 09:20.959
[laughter]

09:25.041 --> 09:27.542
- Okay, if you're gonna convince

09:25.041 --> 09:27.542
Norah you're a poet,

09:27.583 --> 09:30.083
we have to get you familiar

09:27.583 --> 09:30.083
with the fundamentals.

09:30.125 --> 09:32.041
So let's start

09:30.125 --> 09:32.041
with some rhyming.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.875
- Easy enough.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.875
- Okay.

09:33.917 --> 09:36.250
I'll start a rhyme,

09:33.917 --> 09:36.250
and you finish it.

09:36.291 --> 09:40.083
While sitting under the tree,

09:36.291 --> 09:40.083
little Johnny was stung by a...

09:40.125 --> 09:43.250
- Jellyfish.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.166
- Okay, if we want any shot

09:43.291 --> 09:45.166
in the finals,

09:45.208 --> 09:47.041
you need basic sous chef skills.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.834
Now, let's start with

09:47.083 --> 09:48.834
something so simple

09:48.875 --> 09:50.417
that a monkey could do it.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.834
Juicing a lime.

09:50.458 --> 09:52.834
- Yes, Chef.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.750
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

09:57.083 --> 09:58.750
- Aah! Aah!

09:58.792 --> 10:01.166
It's in the ducts!

09:58.792 --> 10:01.166
- Aah!

10:01.208 --> 10:02.875
[laughter]

10:02.917 --> 10:05.125
- Okay, time for some

10:02.917 --> 10:05.125
skateboarding basics.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.959
This is a skateboard.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.959
- Noted.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.250
- Okay, now,

10:08.000 --> 10:12.250
standing on it.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.917
- Piece of cake.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.291
- Okay, so limes

10:13.959 --> 10:16.291
aren't your thing.

10:16.333 --> 10:18.583
[laughter]

10:18.625 --> 10:21.041
- Aah!

10:18.625 --> 10:21.041
It's in the shin.

10:21.083 --> 10:23.041
- My bad.

10:23.083 --> 10:25.208
[laughter]

10:25.250 --> 10:29.041
- Okay, let's move on

10:25.250 --> 10:29.041
to cracking eggs.

10:29.083 --> 10:30.792
Now, the trick is

10:29.083 --> 10:30.792
it's all in the wrist.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.709
Just--

10:30.834 --> 10:32.709
- Okay.

10:36.959 --> 10:40.000
[laughter]

10:41.709 --> 10:43.542
- A little too much wrist.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.542
- I thought you said

10:43.583 --> 10:45.250
a monkey could do this stuff.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.875
- Because a monkey could.

10:47.125 --> 10:49.875
[laughter]

10:49.917 --> 10:52.500
- You really think this is gonna

10:49.917 --> 10:52.500
make me sound like a poet?

10:52.542 --> 10:54.250
- Let's hope.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.250
On your left hand

10:54.291 --> 10:56.917
are types of poetry.

10:54.291 --> 10:56.917
On your right are adjectives.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.667
So when Norah asks you

10:56.959 --> 10:59.667
about poetry,

10:59.709 --> 11:02.291
just say, "I find,"

10:59.709 --> 11:02.291
and then one word from the left

11:02.333 --> 11:03.542
and one from the right.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.709
Awesome.

11:03.583 --> 11:06.709
I find...

11:06.750 --> 11:08.709
sonnets...

11:08.750 --> 11:10.458
inspiring.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.709
Nailed it.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.709
- You've earned this, Mr. Poet.

11:13.750 --> 11:15.750
And I think you know it.

11:15.792 --> 11:17.625
Nope, it's just for holding.

11:17.667 --> 11:19.000
[laughter]

11:19.041 --> 11:22.333
- Okay, I think I found

11:19.041 --> 11:22.333
a way to use your...

11:22.375 --> 11:24.709
let's call it skill,

11:22.375 --> 11:24.709
in the kitchen.

11:24.750 --> 11:28.500
Now, do what comes naturally.

11:30.834 --> 11:33.375
[laughter]

11:33.417 --> 11:35.625
- Look at me!

11:33.417 --> 11:35.625
I'm cooking!

11:35.667 --> 11:36.417

11:36.458 --> 11:38.959
- Dude, that 540 was sick.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.250
Look at me.

11:40.166 --> 11:43.250
I'm skateboarding!

11:43.291 --> 11:45.417
- [together] We're ready.

11:43.291 --> 11:45.417

11:54.709 --> 11:56.625
- So, Dicky, what do you

11:54.709 --> 11:56.625
think about haikus?

11:56.667 --> 12:00.375
- Well, haikus are okay,

11:56.667 --> 12:00.375
but I find...

12:00.417 --> 12:03.208
Free verse...exhilarating.

12:06.125 --> 12:08.667
You know so much.

It makes you look so extreme.

12:17.875 --> 12:21.875

So simple, yet so effective.

No one could walk a mile
