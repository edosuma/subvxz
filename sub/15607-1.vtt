WEBVTT

00:05.048 --> 00:08.547
Your Majesty, the world has disembarked.

00:08.548 --> 00:11.127
Here in London, Imperial Service Troops

00:11.138 --> 00:15.350
from each and every dominion
make camp in Hyde Park.

00:15.463 --> 00:19.917
Your capital opens its arms to your empire.

00:19.918 --> 00:22.808
And here, that empire will
pay tribute to your reign,

00:22.819 --> 00:25.650
to this Diamond Jubilee.

00:25.901 --> 00:31.025
Er, from the palace, you will
lead the procession, 45,000

00:31.036 --> 00:34.857
men at arms, cavalry from your homeland,

00:34.858 --> 00:37.197
Munshi, Bengal Lancers.

00:37.198 --> 00:41.637
It will be a living gazetteer
of your realms, Majesty.

00:41.648 --> 00:46.862
The streets will be
lined, the joy unconfined.

00:47.802 --> 00:50.612
Following your lead up Constitution Hill,

00:50.623 --> 00:53.631
St. James to Pall Mall, Trafalgar Square,

00:53.642 --> 00:58.978
The Strand until St. Paul's
where the Bishop of London...

02:00.996 --> 02:06.329
_

02:09.699 --> 02:11.528
Silence, silence!

02:11.529 --> 02:13.979
Assistant Commissioner
of Police Augustus Dove

02:13.990 --> 02:15.480
will now give address.

02:15.491 --> 02:20.271
Ladies, gentlemen, people of Whitechapel,

02:20.869 --> 02:23.719
as the wider city prepares
itself for celebration

02:23.730 --> 02:25.731
the like of which we have never seen,

02:27.479 --> 02:31.311
Scotland Yard invites you here
today with double incentive

02:31.987 --> 02:34.798
to introduce you to your new station house,

02:35.352 --> 02:38.319
a magnificent building,
I'm sure you'll agree.

02:41.781 --> 02:45.416
But first, to congratulate Inspector Drake

02:45.427 --> 02:47.886
and his division on their rigorous pursuit

02:47.897 --> 02:49.344
and capture of the man who murdered

02:49.355 --> 02:51.990
the Rabbi Leon Ratovski.

02:53.636 --> 02:54.836
Here, here!

02:56.619 --> 03:00.379
Sentence of death has now
been handed down on his killer.

03:00.390 --> 03:02.247
A sentence we at Scotland Yard

03:02.258 --> 03:06.378
do, albeit with sadness, welcome.

03:06.619 --> 03:07.928
Now come.

03:07.929 --> 03:11.880
Mr. Drake is keen to show you his new home.

03:20.169 --> 03:23.043
Mr. Drake, will you explain?

03:25.709 --> 03:27.583
It is a telephone.

03:27.669 --> 03:30.728
The line here is connected
throughout the stations,

03:30.729 --> 03:32.742
a system of communication, which allows

03:32.753 --> 03:36.094
the Inspector and his men to speak
to each other wherever they work.

03:36.569 --> 03:40.318
Assistance may be requested,
information passed on.

03:40.319 --> 03:42.159
Young boys will go to school,

03:42.170 --> 03:44.856
not run policeman's lunch orders for them.

03:45.349 --> 03:49.548
Of this, however, we
are particularly proud.

03:49.549 --> 03:52.228
It was well known Mr.
Drake's predecessor kept

03:52.239 --> 03:55.364
a criminal archive in the rafters
of the old Leman Street Station.

03:56.099 --> 03:57.738
Sergeant Drummond.

03:57.739 --> 03:59.491
Mr. Reid's files were photographed,

03:59.502 --> 04:02.668
and their size then shrunk
by a ratio of 160 to 1.

04:02.669 --> 04:07.133
We now add to them daily, each and
every reported villainy read here.

04:07.639 --> 04:11.221
Imagine a stanhope, but of
more applicable function.

04:12.089 --> 04:13.951
What do you call it, Inspector?

04:15.412 --> 04:17.387
It is the microreader.

04:23.091 --> 04:24.991
_

04:38.689 --> 04:41.590
I prefer these places
empty, it must be said.

04:42.539 --> 04:45.022
But it is not their place to be empty.

04:46.259 --> 04:51.112
We laugh, I know, but there is
a truth buried in that laughter.

04:51.123 --> 04:54.741
We must not forget that the hoped
for conclusion of police work

04:54.752 --> 04:57.503
is not a prison groaning with convicts,

04:58.269 --> 05:00.179
but no prisons at all.

05:01.149 --> 05:04.267
Inspector Drake, no
sooner does your new master

05:04.278 --> 05:06.437
at Scotland Yard hand you down new premises

05:06.448 --> 05:09.104
than he seeks to make you
surplus to requirements.

05:09.115 --> 05:12.151
It is a redundancy I would
welcome, Miss Castello.

05:12.509 --> 05:14.284
Wouldn't we all, Mr. Drake?

05:14.879 --> 05:17.224
It is a utopia.

05:23.293 --> 05:27.207
Inspector Drake, might I bring you
back to less, ah, elevated matters?

05:27.579 --> 05:29.120
Go on, Miss Castello.

05:29.131 --> 05:31.677
As regards the murderer of Rabbi Ratovski,

05:31.688 --> 05:33.822
Mr. Dove tells us the sentence of death

05:33.833 --> 05:36.956
handed down on the Whitechapel
golem is welcomed at Scotland Yard.

05:36.967 --> 05:40.126
Do you here at H Division
echo that sentiment?

05:40.299 --> 05:42.671
I would prefer to call him by his name.

05:42.989 --> 05:45.646
It was your newspaper dubbed him otherwise.

05:46.119 --> 05:49.887
Not so, Inspector. We simply
echoed the frightened voices

05:49.898 --> 05:51.519
heard amongst the jury of Whitechapel.

05:51.530 --> 05:55.113
Nonetheless, the inspector
makes sound argument.

05:55.344 --> 05:58.348
This borough here has a taste for monsters,

05:58.349 --> 06:00.267
for their birthing and nurture.

06:00.278 --> 06:03.348
Then let us here of the
man behind that monster.

06:03.349 --> 06:05.974
Will we have his given
name from you, Mr. Drake?

06:05.985 --> 06:08.382
You know it. It is Isaac Bloom.

06:08.810 --> 06:11.854
A mathematician, part
of the same Whitechapel

06:11.865 --> 06:15.125
jury, and well known to
H Division, was he not?

06:15.231 --> 06:18.677
He gave service to your predecessor
more than once, so I understand.

06:18.688 --> 06:21.528
He may have, Miss Castello, but
that does not alter the facts.

06:21.529 --> 06:24.085
Men may change. Bloom is no different.

06:24.096 --> 06:27.208
The rabbi Leon Ratovski
visited London from Paris.

06:27.209 --> 06:31.258
Isaac Bloom killed him in a Whitechapel
laneway and will hang for it.

06:31.259 --> 06:34.504
Let those facts be known,
if you will, Miss Castello,

06:34.893 --> 06:36.508
then let him be forgot.

06:39.226 --> 06:40.989
_

07:02.261 --> 07:03.464
Sergeant.

07:05.139 --> 07:07.678
- Detective Sergeant.
- I need to see the old man.

07:07.679 --> 07:10.571
Mr. Drake has guests, as you know.

07:10.869 --> 07:12.529
He must hear this, however.

07:14.799 --> 07:16.718
Frank, save the shoe leather.

07:16.719 --> 07:20.395
I'm sure it must be near run
through, and new boots are costly.

07:26.982 --> 07:29.851
Were it not for the fact I
think you'd enjoy it too much,

07:30.029 --> 07:33.117
I'd take this piece of machinery
and I'd shove it up your...

07:36.489 --> 07:37.689
Hello?

07:37.700 --> 07:39.990
There's a murdered man washed
up on the Western Dock, sir.

07:40.001 --> 07:41.503
I'll be there, Sergeant.

07:42.399 --> 07:44.401
- Sir, I...
- You go, Inspector.

07:44.412 --> 07:45.940
OK, excuse me.

07:47.949 --> 07:49.427
Oh, Mr. Drake.

07:49.565 --> 07:51.131
One moment, please.

07:54.379 --> 07:57.100
This today, it is much appreciated.

07:57.529 --> 07:59.811
I know such work is not to your taste.

07:59.822 --> 08:01.814
I understand, sir. It is important.

08:01.825 --> 08:06.017
The men feel their work is seen, and
such witnessing gives encouragement.

08:06.679 --> 08:08.337
You have me, Inspector.

08:30.382 --> 08:32.683
Stand aside. Police, stand aside.

08:37.250 --> 08:41.087
Mr. Drake, my men and I,
we are happy to see you.

08:41.089 --> 08:43.573
The elected steward for
dock, wharf, riverside,

08:43.583 --> 08:45.608
and general labourers union. Happy?

08:45.619 --> 08:47.739
I shall remember the day, Mr. Teague.

08:50.489 --> 08:51.689
You are?

08:52.449 --> 08:56.168
Name's Croker, Croker's
Wharf, two ticks upriver.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.969
Where that reefer should
now be getting its freight

08:58.980 --> 09:01.334
unshipped if you will not
say otherwise, Inspector.

09:01.345 --> 09:03.215
Forgive me. I am brought
here for a dead man,

09:03.226 --> 09:05.209
not to arbitrate in a labour dispute.

09:07.856 --> 09:09.163
Ah well,

09:11.252 --> 09:13.094
allow me, Inspector.

09:22.489 --> 09:24.058
Indian fellow.

09:24.162 --> 09:27.298
Last guy working the sieves,
most like, from his colouring.

09:27.299 --> 09:28.976
It was him what has put him there.

09:28.987 --> 09:30.342
That is slander, Roy.

09:30.532 --> 09:32.318
Do you accuse us of murder?

09:32.319 --> 09:34.596
Yes, Mr. Teague. Do you?

09:34.969 --> 09:39.498
No, I say only that this
wharfinger has found a floater

09:39.509 --> 09:41.617
on the night tide, sought
to gig it downriver,

09:41.628 --> 09:44.920
and land it here, and see these
men go work this come sunrise.

09:45.709 --> 09:48.771
That is 500 frozen
carcasses from New Zealand,

09:48.782 --> 09:52.144
mutton, lamb, pig, 50
kegs of butter alongside.

09:52.155 --> 09:54.200
As good a day's work as these
men have known all month.

09:54.211 --> 09:56.026
Booked for lumping right here.

09:56.037 --> 09:59.490
But if you will now close this
dock to mount investigation,

09:59.501 --> 10:01.931
then he, who pays no dues to this union

10:01.942 --> 10:03.968
and lives outside its regulation,

10:03.969 --> 10:06.477
will have his lightmen out
on the water in two jiffies

10:06.488 --> 10:08.574
and take that cargo as his own.

10:09.809 --> 10:11.280
This true, Mr. Croker?

10:11.291 --> 10:13.178
It is not, Mr. Drake.

10:13.179 --> 10:15.058
At least the first part is not.

10:15.059 --> 10:17.790
The second, that those frozen carcasses

10:17.801 --> 10:20.808
be brought ashore for warehousing
and distribution, that is true.

10:20.819 --> 10:23.338
And I shall certainly
be bidding for such work.

10:23.349 --> 10:25.188
You cannibal, Croker! This...

10:25.199 --> 10:27.804
That murdered man is nought
but some Indian googoo,

10:27.815 --> 10:31.053
Inspector, for whom you would
deprive London men of their work!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.750
The man's origin is not
pertinent, Mr. Teague.

10:33.761 --> 10:35.306
You're right about one thing, however.

10:35.317 --> 10:38.038
I shall be closing this
dock for investigation.

10:38.519 --> 10:42.250
As for who works and profits,
well, that is not my lookout.

10:44.529 --> 10:48.136
Sergeant, see this dockside picked

10:48.147 --> 10:49.710
and cleared for evidence.

10:50.139 --> 10:52.565
The murdered man to be
untangled, careful like,

10:52.576 --> 10:54.591
and conveyed to our
deadroom. You understand?

10:54.602 --> 10:56.044
And for yourself?

10:56.149 --> 10:59.380
There's no time. I've go to
drag our surgeon from his pit.

11:01.189 --> 11:02.444
All right.

11:17.530 --> 11:19.236
She-piggy, Captain Jackson.

11:49.619 --> 11:50.908
Jackson.

12:24.679 --> 12:26.542
Morning, Chief.

12:27.609 --> 12:28.992
How are thee?

12:29.572 --> 12:32.112
- One man.
- Four crowns.

12:32.442 --> 12:35.699
Best be quick. There's some
place I need to be this afternoon.

12:36.815 --> 12:40.098
One crown. You work efficiently,
you will be free to leave.

12:40.109 --> 12:42.468
Two crowns, two shillings, and a sixpence,

12:42.479 --> 12:44.230
and I leave when I say I leave.

12:59.462 --> 13:00.711
Jackson.

13:01.761 --> 13:02.971
Drake.

13:04.889 --> 13:06.146
Come on.

13:07.239 --> 13:08.715
You have the look.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.951
What look?

13:11.519 --> 13:13.277
Bulldog swallows wasp.

13:13.288 --> 13:16.342
Read all about it! Susan Hart to Hang?

13:20.599 --> 13:21.799
This man.

13:21.810 --> 13:23.582
_

13:24.630 --> 13:26.138
Yeah, what of him?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.481
In two days time, we are told.

13:27.492 --> 13:28.801
Yeah, I can do math, Drake.

13:28.812 --> 13:30.850
And yet you still make no plans to visit.

13:32.952 --> 13:34.296
Visit whom?

13:35.089 --> 13:39.287
Your wife, she who languishes
in Newgate these three years,

13:39.298 --> 13:41.360
she who'll soon no longer be your wife

13:41.371 --> 13:45.552
- on account of the fact she will be...
- No, Drake. No plans.

13:51.249 --> 13:53.008
No surprises.

13:53.009 --> 13:54.856
Do you understand, Inspector?

13:55.429 --> 13:57.179
This week of all weeks.

13:57.190 --> 14:01.423
Secretary Chamberlain,
it is a happy occasion.

14:01.898 --> 14:04.771
You relax, get yourself happy.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.498
I shall get happy, Mr. Constantine,

14:09.509 --> 14:12.487
when you have delivered to us
what we have asked you to deliver.

14:12.498 --> 14:15.492
This Munshi, the Queen's
manservant, his influence might

14:15.503 --> 14:19.107
be feared by her household, but
my spies have no such worries, sir.

14:19.118 --> 14:21.599
Could be he's cleaner
than you gentlemen imagine.

14:21.610 --> 14:25.860
By which you imply you are yet to
find anything demonstrates otherwise?

14:25.871 --> 14:27.580
We watch, sir. We look.

14:27.591 --> 14:29.394
Well, look harder.

14:30.559 --> 14:32.673
He and his moon-faced friends,

14:32.993 --> 14:35.958
there are extreme beliefs amongst them.

14:35.959 --> 14:39.883
And extreme beliefs beget
extreme action, Inspector.

14:41.164 --> 14:45.023
We must put an end to this
Muslim Patriotic League.

14:48.679 --> 14:50.178
It's left to right.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.397
It's quick work.

14:53.419 --> 14:55.618
There is little by which to place him.

14:55.880 --> 14:58.252
But he is of South Asian origin.

14:59.304 --> 15:01.196
Well, that's a keen eye on you, Drake.

15:02.819 --> 15:07.086
I thought at first lascar, but his hands,

15:07.387 --> 15:09.188
there's no callouses from the sea work.

15:09.199 --> 15:11.943
His nails are well kept and unbroken.

15:13.514 --> 15:14.714
Ah!

15:19.199 --> 15:23.799
There's, ah... some remains of
soil from the tread his boots.

15:26.679 --> 15:29.512
But that does not look
like river mud to me,

15:29.718 --> 15:31.466
not our river least ways.

15:31.881 --> 15:35.082
And you pronounce this from which analysis?

15:35.093 --> 15:36.499
It's not black enough.

15:40.386 --> 15:41.605
Yes.

15:42.649 --> 15:45.764
I think that analysis might
be improved upon, however.

15:46.561 --> 15:48.816
It's warm day. Let's put him on ice.

15:57.010 --> 15:58.435
Ratovski?

16:08.849 --> 16:11.294
I think Mr. Ratovski
may leave us, may he not,

16:11.305 --> 16:14.261
now that, ah, Bloom's been sentenced?

16:15.444 --> 16:17.996
Still something to credit a man like that?

16:18.819 --> 16:20.519
Such savagery.

16:21.159 --> 16:24.595
Why? Because Isaac Bloom
was a man of thought?

16:24.952 --> 16:27.517
Isn't a man's mind the darkest part of all?

16:27.528 --> 16:29.839
It was a mind much loved by Reid.

16:31.774 --> 16:35.325
Never knew a man of such
clear-eyed, intellectual courage.

16:35.336 --> 16:36.866
Those were his words.

16:36.877 --> 16:38.317
Yes, there were.

16:39.229 --> 16:41.245
Edmund Reid was wrong about plenty

16:41.256 --> 16:43.076
in the course of his life here.

17:35.563 --> 17:38.382
Well, Mr. Reid, how is the water?

17:38.393 --> 17:40.736
Bracing, Mr. Ramuz, even in June.

17:40.747 --> 17:42.194
Bathing is not recommended.

17:42.205 --> 17:43.688
Here, Edmund.

17:43.689 --> 17:45.144
Ah, thank you.

17:46.259 --> 17:49.058
And so your calculations?

17:49.059 --> 17:52.048
The running ebb current runs at 10 and a Â½,

17:52.059 --> 17:54.297
the flow a notch above 9.

17:54.299 --> 17:58.678
These two currents produce what
I understand to be a tidal scour.

17:58.679 --> 18:01.097
It's a process of erosion
that moves the beach materials,

18:01.108 --> 18:04.471
the sand, and the stone and so forth
to the eastern side of the pier.

18:04.482 --> 18:07.339
- Away from where the housing is built.
- Yes.

18:08.132 --> 18:09.893
Removal of the freshwater oyster beds

18:09.904 --> 18:12.432
compounded the issue, in my opinion.

18:12.443 --> 18:16.191
It may have, but this is to be
a resort town, not a fish farm.

18:17.719 --> 18:19.855
How do you believe it might be stopped?

18:20.445 --> 18:22.145
I'm not sure I know, sir.

18:22.156 --> 18:24.281
It is the sea, after all.

18:30.949 --> 18:34.131
I hope, Edmund, you'll forgive
my father his sharpness.

18:34.369 --> 18:35.958
He has much invested here.

18:35.969 --> 18:37.472
It's understandable.

18:38.479 --> 18:40.965
Should Hampton-on-Sea
become Hampton-in-the-Sea,

18:40.976 --> 18:42.298
we will have lost everything.

18:46.119 --> 18:48.857
And so do you see, Edmund,
how your coming here

18:48.868 --> 18:56.653
is a boon to us, the community
we built here, and to myself also?

18:58.189 --> 19:00.919
My Alfred gone, I'd come
to think my life would be

19:00.930 --> 19:03.048
solely dedicated to that rouse.

19:03.231 --> 19:07.138
Yes, the, er, friendship
our daughters have made,

19:07.544 --> 19:09.209
a great pleasure to us all.

19:11.779 --> 19:15.288
What a day we shall have, come the
Jubilee, the four of us together.

19:24.639 --> 19:26.368
Why is she dressed as the Queen,

19:26.369 --> 19:28.318
and what are they doing, Mathilda?

19:28.319 --> 19:30.179
Shh, Valerie, watch.

19:32.219 --> 19:34.313
He makes a kind of love to her.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.040
Mathilda, our train.

19:40.029 --> 19:41.640
Christ, Val, we must run.

19:58.267 --> 19:59.467
What?

19:59.478 --> 20:00.945
The new police station.

20:02.629 --> 20:04.108
That is Samuel Drummond.

20:04.119 --> 20:05.525
His friends call him Drum.

20:06.109 --> 20:07.873
And that is Francis Thatcher.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.064
Which do you consider the more handsome?

20:10.349 --> 20:11.588
- Drum.
- Yes.

20:12.352 --> 20:14.936
Come. We may cut through to the
new underground station here,

20:14.947 --> 20:16.754
direct from Whitechapel to Victoria.

20:32.600 --> 20:34.819
_

20:40.098 --> 20:42.717
_

20:42.728 --> 20:46.011
_

20:53.381 --> 20:56.498
Rose, please, stop your crying.

21:01.689 --> 21:05.766
Forgive me, Miss Susan. It's just...

21:06.284 --> 21:07.939
it's only that...

21:09.188 --> 21:12.584
all become so real, to think that...

21:13.649 --> 21:15.153
Mr. Theakston?

21:15.164 --> 21:16.545
Yes, Miss S?

21:16.556 --> 21:18.423
Will you take Connor for a few moments?

21:18.434 --> 21:20.156
Course, Miss S.

21:24.139 --> 21:25.584
Give me that.

21:37.715 --> 21:39.388
Rose, understand.

21:39.389 --> 21:43.226
I am resigned that the law of this land

21:43.237 --> 21:47.294
allowed me this time to
birth and nurse my son.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.285
Well, it is a blessing,

21:51.387 --> 21:53.974
but my sentence was always my sentence.

21:54.689 --> 21:56.635
The death that I brought, Rose,

21:58.300 --> 21:59.973
it must be paid down.

22:03.589 --> 22:05.704
And tell me, how fares the captain?

22:10.029 --> 22:11.818
It is a wonder

22:12.568 --> 22:16.710
that you can ask after him
with such kindness, is sweet.

22:18.671 --> 22:21.524
He is getting about his same old games,

22:22.319 --> 22:25.589
not one thought in this world for you,

22:26.416 --> 22:29.259
- or his son.
- Come, Rose.

22:31.149 --> 22:34.838
He and I, all that we have lived through...

22:37.731 --> 22:39.910
I will not have rancour in my heart,

22:41.017 --> 22:42.372
not now,

22:42.777 --> 22:44.646
and above all, not for him.

23:10.625 --> 23:15.439
All who love you must
grieve, Miss Susan, grieve.

23:15.989 --> 23:17.845
They'll not suspect a thing.

23:20.338 --> 23:23.753
Broken hearts are a small
price to pay for freedom.

23:30.939 --> 23:33.676
The low to medium concentrations
of calcium and zinc

23:33.687 --> 23:36.188
in the soil, would suggests parkland.

23:36.189 --> 23:40.052
Further, we have some copper,
northern and central parkland.

23:40.341 --> 23:43.220
Hyde Park, Regent's Park,
Hampstead Heath, Primrose Hill.

23:43.231 --> 23:45.521
No, no, no. It's too wide a net. Do better.

23:45.682 --> 23:46.906
Gladly.

23:47.399 --> 23:49.714
There's little arsenic within, however.

23:49.715 --> 23:51.170
Well, that's a pity.

23:51.354 --> 23:53.084
Oh, that's cute Benito.

23:53.439 --> 23:56.407
Northern parks would show
an elevated arsenic count.

23:56.418 --> 24:00.026
So you can strike Hampstead and
Primrose from the list, therefore.

24:00.359 --> 24:01.675
Now here,

24:03.168 --> 24:05.072
these are redworm eggs.

24:06.509 --> 24:10.054
Redworms are horse
parasites, shat out in manure.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.728
There's a parade in this city on Tuesday,

24:12.729 --> 24:14.775
a parade involving a
great number of infantry

24:14.786 --> 24:16.093
and an equal number of cavalry.

24:16.104 --> 24:18.981
And which park does the
cavalry make its encampmentry?

24:18.992 --> 24:20.369
Hyde Park, Bengal Lancers.

24:20.380 --> 24:22.453
Drake, you'll need this.

24:51.930 --> 24:54.408
Police, who is it commands here?

25:01.529 --> 25:03.962
I am Risaldar-Major Al-Qadir.

25:03.973 --> 25:05.527
These are my men,

25:06.319 --> 25:09.124
And do you currently lack for one, sir?

25:09.135 --> 25:10.335
Luck?

25:10.509 --> 25:13.247
A man, have you any missing?

25:13.258 --> 25:14.458
Why do you ask?

25:14.469 --> 25:16.141
There's a dead man of your stock

25:16.152 --> 25:18.485
found on the shore of a
Whitechapel dock this morning.

25:18.496 --> 25:20.472
Hyde Park dirt and horse shit about him.

25:20.939 --> 25:22.995
Not too far north of 30 years of age.

25:23.428 --> 25:24.895
Oh, and he, ah...

25:26.336 --> 25:27.659
he wore this.

25:36.329 --> 25:37.893
Good afternoon, sir.

25:38.159 --> 25:39.893
Good afternoon, Sergeant.

25:39.904 --> 25:42.556
Drum, will you inform Captain Jackson

25:42.567 --> 25:44.688
we hope to identify our river man.

25:44.946 --> 25:46.331
Right away, sir.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.181
Major Al-Qadir,

25:52.422 --> 25:54.358
our surgeon, Captain Jackson.

25:54.359 --> 25:55.561
Captain

25:55.930 --> 25:57.130
of what?

25:57.141 --> 25:59.390
US Army, sir.

26:00.254 --> 26:03.590
Now, Drake, you and the major are all set.

26:05.650 --> 26:07.102
Where is it you go?

26:07.181 --> 26:10.836
That place I needed to
be, I need to be there.

26:16.135 --> 26:17.955
May I show him to you, sir?

26:27.937 --> 26:30.266
He is not one of my soldiers.

26:34.339 --> 26:37.315
No, you do not move, sir!

26:43.076 --> 26:48.103
His name is Mr. Sayid Kalim Abdul Al-Qadir,

26:48.366 --> 26:50.899
graduate of Balliol College Oxford,

26:51.108 --> 26:54.785
barrister at law at the Bar
of England and Wales, and...

26:57.757 --> 26:59.400
he was my son.

27:14.223 --> 27:16.062
Mr. Judge, good morning.

27:16.063 --> 27:18.223
- Mr. Cotter.
- Pleasure to see you once more.

27:18.234 --> 27:21.370
Now, no one is on trial, and I'll
simply have the court's decision.

27:21.381 --> 27:24.612
And that decision
foregone and easy, correct?

27:24.613 --> 27:27.164
Correct, a formality.

27:29.037 --> 27:32.303
Now, this might be an apposite
moment, Mr. Judge, for the, um...

27:33.290 --> 27:35.597
final settlement of my firm's fees.

27:35.608 --> 27:39.154
Oh, er, right. Yeah, certainly.

27:42.933 --> 27:44.674
As agreed, Mr. Cotter.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.305
Well, Mr. Judge, shall we dance?

27:53.922 --> 27:56.497
All rise.

28:01.748 --> 28:04.538
What we saw that man do
earlier to that woman,

28:04.867 --> 28:07.566
do you think my father has
done that too your mother yet?

28:08.386 --> 28:09.832
How was your day?

28:09.942 --> 28:12.669
Tennyson and trigonometry,
my stock and trade.

28:14.650 --> 28:16.723
This is soot. How do you have soot on you?

28:17.090 --> 28:18.664
I have no idea.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.819
How could it possibly be soot?

28:20.820 --> 28:23.421
My next question, Mathilda. How indeed?

28:23.432 --> 28:26.506
Come, Father, it is
only a smear on a collar,

28:26.517 --> 28:28.415
and you are no longer a policeman.

28:42.234 --> 28:43.628
Open it, please.

28:46.744 --> 28:51.100
_

28:51.460 --> 28:52.660
Thank you.

28:55.464 --> 28:57.551
Right, all this, the details of his work,

28:57.562 --> 29:00.763
see it boxed and ordered,
returned to Sergeant Drummond.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.390
Did your son share the details
of his life with you, sir?

29:12.674 --> 29:13.964
Share?

29:15.090 --> 29:18.203
Where he went, who he
knew, what he thought?

29:19.330 --> 29:22.249
We spoke for only one half of an hour

29:22.250 --> 29:25.500
three days past, and
that, the sole conversation

29:25.511 --> 29:28.868
in which he and I have
partook in almost six years.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.812
- Since he left India.
- Correct.

29:35.408 --> 29:37.419
- My Sayid.
- That is he?

29:37.430 --> 29:38.634
- It is.
- Forgive me,

29:38.645 --> 29:41.529
but when you and your
son spoke recently, sir,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.678
did he say when he might be leaving here?

29:43.830 --> 29:46.067
- Leaving?
- Going home, sir.

29:46.290 --> 29:49.644
This was his home,
Inspector, London, England.

29:49.900 --> 29:51.975
He was an English gentleman.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.325
Oh.

29:58.448 --> 30:02.705
Sir, do you know this
other man, this Mr. Hafeez?

30:02.716 --> 30:04.645
With regret, I do.

30:04.656 --> 30:08.508
He made friend of my son
in Pune, Deccan College.

30:08.757 --> 30:10.759
His name is Imran Hafeez.

30:10.770 --> 30:13.017
So they did not travel to Oxford together?

30:14.072 --> 30:15.721
They did not.

30:16.340 --> 30:20.229
And this low opinion
you suffer of Mr. Hafeez?

30:20.230 --> 30:23.067
He is a bad boy, no respect.

30:25.069 --> 30:27.072
Common, you understand.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.076
Oh, I do.

30:30.418 --> 30:33.124
Ask about, the last
time anyone employed here

30:33.135 --> 30:35.631
spoke to Sayid Al-Qadir or Mr. Hafeez.

30:42.689 --> 30:45.560
Order, order in the court!

30:46.379 --> 30:48.526
Order, order!

30:48.661 --> 30:50.347
Order, I say!

30:55.311 --> 30:58.869
You said it was a
formality. You assured me.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.799
It's taken us 18 months
to get here, Cotter!

31:01.800 --> 31:04.207
Come, Mr. Judge, a lawyer's assurances.

31:23.983 --> 31:25.595
Edmund, might I?

31:27.348 --> 31:31.173
You do not invite us
in, and I understand why,

31:31.184 --> 31:32.976
that it would not seem proper,

31:33.304 --> 31:34.504
but...

31:34.701 --> 31:37.122
there is present propriety,

31:37.670 --> 31:40.387
and there is a future where we might,

31:40.398 --> 31:46.447
you and I, construct a world where such
considerations need no longer be met.

31:49.702 --> 31:50.950
Edmund? W...

31:53.958 --> 31:55.172
Who is she?

31:55.183 --> 31:57.932
Miss Goren, Deborah.

31:59.008 --> 32:00.545
Hello, Edmund.

32:04.143 --> 32:05.623
You had not heard?

32:06.048 --> 32:08.606
I, er, no longer take the London papers.

32:08.607 --> 32:10.395
Course, why would you?

32:12.014 --> 32:14.072
Mathilda, I think you
might get to your books.

32:14.083 --> 32:15.771
My books are read, Father.

32:16.561 --> 32:18.394
Then if you wish, as you say you do,

32:18.405 --> 32:21.099
that I will send you to Oxford,
I suggest you read them again,

32:21.110 --> 32:22.709
or I will call on Mr.
Worthing in the morning

32:22.720 --> 32:25.647
and say that yes, my daughter would
make an admirable secretarial assistant,

32:25.658 --> 32:27.267
and that will be that for your learning.

32:27.531 --> 32:29.207
Now, leave us.

32:37.077 --> 32:38.821
How on Earth did you find me?

32:39.080 --> 32:40.822
Ah, it was not so hard.

32:40.970 --> 32:42.779
You are still talked of in Whitechapel.

32:42.780 --> 32:44.478
I expect you will be forever.

32:44.489 --> 32:47.943
There's still no policeman afforded
greater respect than Edmund Reid.

32:48.420 --> 32:50.219
Bennet Drake is not afforded respect?

32:50.230 --> 32:52.219
No, of course, but it is Mr. Drake...

32:52.220 --> 32:56.279
Who led the investigation which now
sees Isaac Bloom facing execution.

32:56.280 --> 32:59.431
Isaac did not do such a
thing. It is not within him.

33:00.950 --> 33:02.579
And who else shares this conviction?

33:02.580 --> 33:03.782
Only myself.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.259
And, I hoped,

33:07.526 --> 33:08.948
perhaps yourself.

33:11.320 --> 33:16.249
So you thought that I
would now travel to London,

33:16.250 --> 33:19.139
to Whitechapel, and challenge the care

33:19.140 --> 33:22.579
and rigour with which my
friend has prosecuted this case?

33:23.421 --> 33:25.399
Forgive me, Miss Goren,
but that is a leap of faith

33:25.410 --> 33:28.446
based on no other logic but
your own. I will not do it.

33:28.457 --> 33:32.276
No, it is you who must forgive me. I'm in
your home, and I've raised you to anger.

33:32.287 --> 33:35.019
Thank you, both of you,
for your hospitality.

33:36.860 --> 33:39.924
No, please, stay. Stay
with us. Eat with us.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.951
Please, Deborah, I
insist. So will Mathilda.

33:47.387 --> 33:48.587
Thank you.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.878
I gave thanks when it was said that
your daughter had been returned to you.

34:01.010 --> 34:05.260
I remembered your conviction,
and... and I admire you, Edmund.

34:05.271 --> 34:09.185
It cannot be an easy thing to grant
her the freedom you now so clearly do.

34:11.272 --> 34:13.699
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean, Deborah.

34:14.812 --> 34:17.871
I saw her and her friend. They
boarded my train at Victorian.

34:18.699 --> 34:20.650
I assumed that...

34:21.810 --> 34:23.010
Soot.

34:24.310 --> 34:25.856
Mathilda Reid!

34:26.748 --> 34:29.563
Mathilda! In here!

34:31.000 --> 34:34.585
Soot, Mathilda, soot!

34:35.040 --> 34:37.742
London, where is it you go?

34:37.753 --> 34:38.987
To our home, Father.

34:38.998 --> 34:41.437
It is not our home, not any lo... good God,

34:41.447 --> 34:44.509
did you take Valerie Freeman
with you to Whitechapel?

34:44.510 --> 34:45.869
She was curious.

34:45.870 --> 34:48.539
And why should she not be?
It is a fascinating place.

34:48.540 --> 34:50.552
And do you not think, Mathilda, on what

34:50.563 --> 34:52.206
might happen to her, to you?

34:52.217 --> 34:54.728
You of all... you know
what happens in Whitechapel!

34:54.730 --> 34:56.413
I do. I never forget.

34:56.424 --> 34:58.979
And do you see, my
darling, how this pains me?

34:58.980 --> 35:00.619
I brought you here.

35:00.810 --> 35:02.858
I brought us both here so that in time

35:02.869 --> 35:04.599
these memories might be forgot.

35:04.600 --> 35:07.111
But I am older now, grown.

35:10.340 --> 35:13.699
And I understand something
I think you do not, Father,

35:13.700 --> 35:17.293
that I am made and cannot be remade.

35:18.190 --> 35:20.439
Do you not think, despite all that you

35:20.440 --> 35:24.368
have constructed here, that
the same might be true of you?

35:27.384 --> 35:29.896
You will go to your room, Mathilda.

35:30.090 --> 35:32.320
And there will be no more
of this, do you understand?

35:34.800 --> 35:37.014
No more, Mathilda.

36:09.820 --> 36:12.762
I do not write the law in this
goddamned country, Caitlin.

36:12.773 --> 36:16.329
Neither am I a judge, both of which

36:16.330 --> 36:18.588
resolved that in the absence of a corpse,

36:18.599 --> 36:21.378
seven years must pass before
your father be declared dead

36:21.389 --> 36:24.500
and his worldly goods
handed to his surviving heir,

36:25.640 --> 36:27.052
our son.

36:28.055 --> 36:31.119
Forgive me, but is this not the
reason why we hired a lawyer?

36:31.120 --> 36:32.530
A lawyer only makes the argument.

36:32.541 --> 36:34.085
He... he don't rule

36:34.742 --> 36:39.708
And this man, Cotter, he
was the best you could find?

36:39.867 --> 36:41.302
He was.

36:42.262 --> 36:45.908
And by best, Matthew,
I do mean most costly.

36:46.674 --> 36:50.213
I paid what I could muster.

36:52.230 --> 36:55.368
Well, I am glad to know what
value you place on my life,

36:55.970 --> 36:58.466
- that of our son, also.
- Now, you wait a minute.

36:59.780 --> 37:02.970
You think I'm out there running
a bullion brokerage? I am not.

37:03.390 --> 37:06.439
I'm the hired knife of a
police division in Whitechapel.

37:06.440 --> 37:08.049
I do not drink no more.

37:08.050 --> 37:09.250
I do not gamble.

37:09.251 --> 37:11.828
And I've saved damn near
every farthing I could

37:11.839 --> 37:13.129
for our case to be made.

37:13.130 --> 37:16.360
Sobriety and thrift, you have my sympathies

37:16.530 --> 37:18.029
for the many privations you must have

37:18.030 --> 37:20.439
suffered in your inevitable
pursuit of failure.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.639
I was set on guns and
fast horses, remember?

37:22.640 --> 37:24.770
This was before even your
sentence was passed down,

37:24.781 --> 37:26.739
before even our son was born, but it

37:26.740 --> 37:29.729
was you that said they'll
allow me to raise the boy,

37:29.730 --> 37:32.510
and you that said that this was not Arizona

37:32.521 --> 37:35.048
and escape should be won with
hard cash and not dynamite.

37:35.059 --> 37:39.360
What I want is for you to act as a
man ought, to protect your family.

37:47.744 --> 37:50.093
Or else I will die, Matthew.

37:53.729 --> 37:54.929
I love you.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.670
I can't lose you.

38:00.293 --> 38:01.890
Then save me.

38:06.436 --> 38:07.872
There's no time.

38:09.405 --> 38:10.937
I don't know how.

38:18.473 --> 38:20.559
Then what use are you to me?

38:20.740 --> 38:23.589
Guard, my husband is leaving.

38:23.590 --> 38:25.632
- Darling, please.
- Out.

39:21.130 --> 39:23.538
You heard it all, I imagine, Dr. Probyn.

39:28.720 --> 39:32.698
All that has been promised,
it may still be yours.

39:32.709 --> 39:34.056
But when?

39:35.383 --> 39:36.735
In due course.

39:36.746 --> 39:40.529
By which you mean after I have
facilitated you and your son's

39:40.530 --> 39:42.371
flight from these walls.

39:42.819 --> 39:44.019
Ah...

39:44.030 --> 39:45.739
It would seem illogical on my part

39:45.740 --> 39:50.488
not to take the promised payment
whilst you are still proximate.

39:52.261 --> 39:53.913
Would you see me beg?

39:56.808 --> 39:58.301
I would not.

39:59.104 --> 40:00.983
But men must be bribed.

40:00.994 --> 40:03.104
Our friend, Guard Theakston,

40:03.628 --> 40:05.945
the good men of the London Wall Laundry

40:05.956 --> 40:08.271
who were to accept the two
of you aboard their cart

40:08.282 --> 40:11.181
the morning after next,
they will not oblige

40:11.877 --> 40:15.237
if I cannot hand to them their incentive.

40:15.438 --> 40:21.230
Now, it will bring nothing
but, ah, sadness to us all,

40:23.154 --> 40:25.991
but I cannot see how it may now be done.

40:30.068 --> 40:36.516
Harry, Apples, Freddy, Edward,
Edward, Zebra... Hafeez.

40:46.205 --> 40:48.966
These are the magazines we took
from the dead lawyer's office?

40:48.977 --> 40:51.343
- Yes, Inspector.
- Not a little amount of bedside

40:51.354 --> 40:52.561
reading for you then.

40:52.572 --> 40:54.960
I shall get about it
presently, however, Inspector.

40:56.728 --> 40:58.416
You're the educated man, Sergeant.

40:58.427 --> 41:00.149
Are you familiar with this tale?

41:01.078 --> 41:03.957
Yeah, I founder one Abdullah Quilliam.

41:03.958 --> 41:07.348
He was born William Henry Quilliam,
son of a watchmaker from Liverpool.

41:07.349 --> 41:09.697
Changed his name upon
taking up Mohammedanism.

41:10.058 --> 41:11.938
- Eh?
- An Englishman, sir,

41:11.949 --> 41:13.658
now adhering to an eastern religion,

41:13.999 --> 41:16.244
one he promotes and
debates beneath that title.

41:20.319 --> 41:22.969
Look here, Sayid Al-Qadir.

41:23.080 --> 41:26.027
Seems our dead man is not only a subscriber

41:26.028 --> 41:27.645
but a contributor also.

41:27.656 --> 41:29.190
Quite so, sir.

41:29.678 --> 41:32.652
The sun of Islam now rises from the west.

41:36.470 --> 41:40.446
_

41:42.668 --> 41:44.497
How where they, Rose?

41:44.498 --> 41:48.568
- How were who?
- You know, your audience, the house.

41:49.255 --> 41:50.531
Oh.

41:52.057 --> 41:53.456
Much as ever.

41:59.339 --> 42:00.549
Thank you.

42:03.448 --> 42:06.017
That dead lead we pulled from the Western.

42:06.738 --> 42:08.915
It's quite some firebrand he was.

42:09.458 --> 42:13.621
We British, he says, are sea wolves
living off the pillage of the Earth.

42:13.632 --> 42:14.832
Hmm.

42:15.588 --> 42:19.409
Such opinion enough to turn
his father's beard blue.

42:21.116 --> 42:23.034
Why does that worry you, Bennet?

42:23.806 --> 42:26.915
He's an upright fella, Bengal Lancer,

42:27.298 --> 42:30.089
sports his stripes with a
pride some might call immodest,

42:30.100 --> 42:33.325
but... I have some feeling for him.

42:34.838 --> 42:37.291
He's never seen the country he serves,

42:37.433 --> 42:39.787
comes here to pay tribute to his Queen,

42:40.012 --> 42:42.950
finds her capital has
taken his boy from him.

42:44.888 --> 42:48.765
You see his grief, and it moves you,

42:50.811 --> 42:52.717
a father's grief.

42:53.468 --> 42:56.560
- Now, Rose.
- Am I not to be allowed my regret,

42:56.922 --> 42:58.956
- Bennet?
- I did not say that,

42:58.967 --> 43:02.712
but you behave on occasion as if
it were myself inflicts it upon you.

43:02.723 --> 43:04.069
And why should you not?

43:05.058 --> 43:08.302
I have not given you what
you had a right to expect.

43:08.313 --> 43:11.000
You give me yourself,
Rose. You give me your love.

43:11.011 --> 43:13.889
- That is all I've ever...
- Don't say it.

43:15.018 --> 43:16.809
It is not all.

43:18.176 --> 43:19.549
It is not.

43:21.618 --> 43:24.496
You may deny it, but the
whole world knows it, Bennet.

43:25.664 --> 43:27.380
They look at their Chief of Police,

43:27.391 --> 43:29.452
and they say to themselves, well,

43:29.768 --> 43:33.912
If he will take a one-time
bonner as his wife.

43:33.923 --> 43:35.123
Oh, for Christ's...

43:35.134 --> 43:37.676
He should have known that nothing can ever

43:37.687 --> 43:40.956
grow within that dry, old hat that she

43:40.967 --> 43:43.423
- now keeps between her legs.
- You will stop this.

43:43.434 --> 43:44.848
- But...
- I will not hear it!

43:50.308 --> 43:54.463
My love, these are no man or
woman's thoughts but your own.

43:54.474 --> 43:56.567
Then why, Bennet?

43:56.849 --> 43:59.584
Why can we not give ourselves a child?

44:59.201 --> 45:02.044
Who believed but you, Edmund,
that your Mathilda lived?

45:02.558 --> 45:04.270
All those that cared for you, myself,

45:04.281 --> 45:06.460
Mr. Drake, all thought
it but a forlorn dream,

45:06.471 --> 45:08.747
wrong-headed and only harmful to yourself.

45:08.748 --> 45:10.942
And yet, you had certainty. You knew.

45:13.508 --> 45:15.638
Isaac did not do this thing.

45:15.778 --> 45:17.828
I know it as you knew your daughter lived,

45:17.839 --> 45:19.665
he did not do this thing.

45:20.436 --> 45:23.397
And think, Edmund, on
what else that might mean,

45:23.558 --> 45:26.994
the true killer still walking
the streets you once knew as home.

45:30.208 --> 45:33.594
You will have missed the last
train by now, I think, Miss Goren.

45:33.723 --> 45:35.466
We shall make a room up for you.

46:02.688 --> 46:04.727
The lady left before daylight, I believe.

46:04.728 --> 46:06.333
She left a note for you, however.

46:06.624 --> 46:08.450
Oh, you read it, I imagine.

46:09.398 --> 46:11.565
- What does it say?
- I do not understand it.

46:11.576 --> 46:13.008
There's only one line.

46:15.768 --> 46:18.398
It is a fragment of verse from the Talmud.

46:19.298 --> 46:21.626
The Hebrew teachings given by God to Moses.

46:21.637 --> 46:22.845
Perhaps.

46:23.309 --> 46:24.697
How does it continue?

46:24.698 --> 46:26.214
Save one life,

46:26.816 --> 46:28.668
- you save the world entire.
- _

46:33.828 --> 46:37.247
Inspector Drake, it is you
who's ordered a manhunt,

46:37.258 --> 46:39.299
- fellow called Hafeez.
- It is.

46:39.476 --> 46:41.672
He is wanted for questioning
in a murder inquiry.

46:41.683 --> 46:43.564
Never mind that,
Inspector. You come with me.

46:43.783 --> 46:44.983
Yes, sir.

46:58.509 --> 47:00.445
This is Inspector Constantine.

47:01.793 --> 47:03.747
Our beloved special branch.

47:04.128 --> 47:05.328
You know this man.

47:05.339 --> 47:07.067
Come, Mr. Drake.

47:07.078 --> 47:09.355
It can surely come as no shock to you.

47:09.988 --> 47:11.648
It's no shock to myself, after all,

47:11.659 --> 47:14.225
that you, here in this
gutter, once more give shelter

47:14.236 --> 47:16.435
to dissidents and vile extremism.

47:16.628 --> 47:19.307
- What is this?
- This man Hafeez,

47:19.318 --> 47:20.898
he is on a watch list.

47:22.848 --> 47:25.850
I would not give that much
credence for this man's word.

47:25.861 --> 47:29.803
This peculiar elevation of
yours, Drake, I'm confused.

47:30.268 --> 47:32.632
It's unlikely to be merited
by a sudden emergence

47:32.643 --> 47:34.694
of brains in that gorilla skull of yours.

47:34.705 --> 47:36.132
- Who do you think you're...
- Sergeant, leave him.

47:36.142 --> 47:40.088
Francis Thatcher, mother dead,
father invalided on a coal barge.

47:40.682 --> 47:42.683
Sister, Lily,

47:43.405 --> 47:46.551
two counts of soliciting
before her 18th birthday.

47:47.178 --> 47:50.017
But you are the sole breadwinner
in that household now.

47:50.093 --> 47:51.581
Are you not, Sergeant?

47:53.918 --> 47:57.525
Sergeant Drummond, a man full grown,

47:57.536 --> 47:59.092
still living with his mother.

47:59.989 --> 48:02.052
Do your colleagues here smirk at such?

48:04.674 --> 48:07.524
Assistant Commissioner, should you

48:07.535 --> 48:09.628
wish to be appraised of my intelligence,

48:09.639 --> 48:11.087
I suggest we leave.

48:13.157 --> 48:16.231
Inspector Drake will
join us, Mr. Constantine.

48:18.050 --> 48:19.348
I insist.

48:22.792 --> 48:24.537
As you prefer, sir.

48:25.258 --> 48:27.956
But you need to hear
what Hafeez has to say.

48:52.288 --> 48:54.401
Muslim Patriotic League,

48:54.412 --> 48:58.011
it's mostly an institution
which bears loyalty to its Queen.

48:58.278 --> 49:00.329
There are factions, sirs,

49:00.531 --> 49:05.144
splinterings that do not envision such
loyalties favourable to men of their faith.

49:10.498 --> 49:13.016
Did I not promise to send word, Major?

49:13.505 --> 49:16.233
I did not undertake to
wait for it, however,

49:16.244 --> 49:18.699
and the man who speaks to crowds is

49:18.710 --> 49:20.727
never such a hard man to find.

49:23.508 --> 49:25.547
Imran Hafeez will now speak.

49:32.618 --> 49:33.911
Brothers,

49:35.259 --> 49:37.952
we are now everywhere under attack,

49:38.760 --> 49:42.882
and even as our Empress
Queen summons her subjects

49:42.893 --> 49:45.385
from the furthest reaches of her dominion,

49:45.904 --> 49:48.182
her whole nation's press

49:48.332 --> 49:50.789
makes a relentless and vituperative attack

49:50.800 --> 49:53.917
against the Ottoman
Sultan and his caliphate.

49:54.538 --> 49:56.897
It is therefore incumbent upon us,

49:56.898 --> 49:59.213
we Muslim men,

49:59.609 --> 50:03.293
advanced by the privilege
of our British educations,

50:03.624 --> 50:07.236
to illuminate the path forward
to those of our brothers

50:07.247 --> 50:09.668
who are not so advantaged,

50:10.177 --> 50:14.845
a path which leads away
from this Empress Queen,

50:14.856 --> 50:19.202
whose rule is soon to be so
loudly cheered in this city,

50:19.213 --> 50:25.943
away from her, and toward, perhaps,
a more natural leader and benefactor.

50:26.308 --> 50:30.044
He, Abdul Hamid II,

50:31.005 --> 50:35.205
The Sublime Khan, Caliph to all Islam.

50:40.468 --> 50:45.155
They find such fault in the
country which raises them up!

50:45.558 --> 50:48.216
Well, let that country

50:48.227 --> 50:51.817
put these moon-faces back down!

51:11.506 --> 51:12.706
Excuse me.

51:14.745 --> 51:15.945
Sorry.

51:19.081 --> 51:20.760
Ha, hey!

51:25.531 --> 51:27.191
Angel, here!

51:40.859 --> 51:43.339
Little moon-face googoo lawyer,

51:43.788 --> 51:47.203
trying to tell good
Englishmen how they must work,

51:47.699 --> 51:49.220
how they must live.

51:50.223 --> 51:51.423
Ah!

52:06.117 --> 52:08.633
Imran, evil child that you
are, you stand behind me.

52:08.895 --> 52:11.891
What's this? You got some toy
soldier to do your fighting for you.

52:11.902 --> 52:15.063
My name is Risaldar-Major Haroun Al-Qadir.

52:15.074 --> 52:17.364
I have travelled to London
to pay tribute to my Queen.

52:17.868 --> 52:19.569
My Queen is your Queen.

52:19.580 --> 52:21.669
And yet no white working man in the docks

52:21.680 --> 52:23.572
is invited to march in front of her.

52:23.718 --> 52:25.684
No, we're cursed and forgot.

52:25.766 --> 52:26.966
Huh?!

52:31.302 --> 52:33.004
Major Al-Qadir.

52:33.413 --> 52:35.987
I cannot believe you are
not at fault for this.

52:35.988 --> 52:37.188
Come!

52:40.532 --> 52:42.170
Mr. Drake, sir.

52:42.648 --> 52:45.583
I believe you wish to
interview this man, Mr. Drake.

52:49.118 --> 52:52.648
Pune, India. The deputy
governor of that state

52:52.659 --> 52:58.074
assassinated at a Jubilee tea
party by this man, Javad Akran.

52:58.273 --> 53:02.564
He, as Mr. Hafeez, as
Sayid Al-Qadir, your victim,

53:02.575 --> 53:05.563
also a graduate of Deccan College.

53:06.138 --> 53:11.801
Hafeez, do you know who this
gentleman is, his back to us?

53:13.418 --> 53:16.131
That, Mr. Dove, is Mr. Abdul Karim.

53:17.308 --> 53:19.208
- The Munshi.
- The same.

53:19.209 --> 53:21.491
Victoria's brown right arm,

53:21.676 --> 53:25.729
an invited guest to a gathering of our
Muslim Patriotic League's top brass.

53:25.740 --> 53:29.995
And here in pleasing colloquy
with Mr. Imran Hafeez,

53:30.006 --> 53:31.847
your murder suspect.

53:31.848 --> 53:37.311
This watched report number
3691, Friday 18th of June 1897,

53:37.322 --> 53:41.375
which for those hard of counting,
Mr. Drake, is this Friday just passed.

53:41.386 --> 53:45.050
Subject Hafeez, Imran observed
in an urgent gesticulation

53:45.061 --> 53:48.662
with subject Al-Qadir,
Sayid, your murder victim.

53:48.673 --> 53:51.543
Shoving and punching
between both gentlemen.

53:53.598 --> 53:55.613
And this latter gentleman now washes up,

53:55.624 --> 53:58.357
his throat cut on a Whitechapel dockside.

53:58.358 --> 54:01.808
All this but days from the most
significant act of patronage

54:01.819 --> 54:04.060
our glorious empire has ever known.

54:04.518 --> 54:06.307
Makes me restive, Mr. Dove.

54:06.318 --> 54:08.313
It makes me urgent curious.

54:08.324 --> 54:11.513
So I shall be taking this Mr. Hafeez,

54:11.524 --> 54:13.453
and I shall see that curiosity fed.

54:13.464 --> 54:15.477
On whose authority, Mr. Constantine?

54:15.478 --> 54:19.963
On my own, Mr. Drake, on that
of the realm's inviolability.

54:19.974 --> 54:21.645
Forgive me, Mr. Dove.

54:21.740 --> 54:26.009
These spies, it is their
business to imagine threat

54:26.020 --> 54:29.957
where none yet exists, but what
we have here in our deadroom

54:29.958 --> 54:32.079
is a sight more real than the fantasies he

54:32.090 --> 54:34.729
summons up of Indian
cuckoos in our Queen's nest.

54:34.740 --> 54:38.874
Mr. Dove, surely you see the
greater scale of our priorities here.

54:40.802 --> 54:44.140
Mr. Hafeez will be remanded
to Inspector Drake's care.

54:47.358 --> 54:49.384
And if I have you overruled?

54:50.243 --> 54:51.969
Who here overrules me?

55:00.238 --> 55:02.452
Do not think me gone for long.

55:11.386 --> 55:14.259
_

55:14.270 --> 55:17.061
_

55:17.072 --> 55:19.862
_

55:57.792 --> 56:02.608
Margate, Chatham, and fast to London
Victoria, ladies and gentlemen.

56:50.818 --> 56:53.442
Roy, that's your girl, Kay.

57:00.870 --> 57:02.998
Christ. No.

57:24.868 --> 57:27.787
Not that I seek your pleasure, Mr. Hafeez,

57:27.798 --> 57:30.358
but there is motive for
you to be grateful to me.

57:38.838 --> 57:41.471
Shall I show you the
cold body of your friend?

57:41.482 --> 57:43.826
It is a sight you would
not forget in a hurry,

57:43.836 --> 57:46.144
not unless it was you who
stuck the knife in his neck,

57:46.974 --> 57:49.771
which is the way I
currently look at the world.

57:53.048 --> 57:54.717
Do you deny it?

57:54.718 --> 57:57.536
Would such denial be
plausible to you, Inspector?

57:59.828 --> 58:01.422
Why don't you try me?

58:15.488 --> 58:18.374
Each night, they wipe it clean.

58:18.598 --> 58:21.147
It is not permitted, they say.

58:21.455 --> 58:24.229
But what can they do to me
that is not already done?

58:25.273 --> 58:31.111
I keep the image of it here,
retranscribe each day and continue on.

58:34.228 --> 58:37.817
You once told me the language of
the universe was written in numbers.

58:38.448 --> 58:43.214
Now it seems you seek
numbers within language,

58:43.637 --> 58:45.325
Hebrew, your language,

58:45.804 --> 58:48.325
- your writing system.
- Mine is the true belief.

58:51.628 --> 58:53.002
Our language is the true language

58:53.013 --> 58:55.477
because our language is
nothing if it is not numbers.

58:56.507 --> 58:57.707
Show me.

58:58.363 --> 58:59.721
Certainly.

59:01.997 --> 59:06.680
This, <i>aleph</i>, you may call it the letter A.

59:06.691 --> 59:09.037
This, <i>bet</i>, B.

59:09.349 --> 59:12.196
The sign values... <i>aleph</i>, one, <i>bet</i>, two.

59:12.197 --> 59:14.993
The Hebrew word for father, <i>Av</i>,

59:15.506 --> 59:19.706
written <i>aleph, bet</i>. One
plus two equals three. You follow?

59:19.717 --> 59:23.598
Now see this, the Torah,

59:24.304 --> 59:26.555
handed to Moses by God

59:26.566 --> 59:31.230
and irreducibly this sequence of numbers.

59:32.568 --> 59:34.903
The Garden of Eden, <i>kedem</i>.

59:36.258 --> 59:43.464
Numerical sum... 144.

59:44.353 --> 59:49.420
<i>Etz Chaim</i>... Tree of Life.

59:50.727 --> 59:58.078
Numerical sum... 233.

59:58.089 --> 01:00:02.422
144, 233... divide the
larger sum by the smaller.

01:00:03.134 --> 01:00:07.146
1 and, ah, a little over 6/10.

01:00:07.147 --> 01:00:08.347
Correct.

01:00:08.497 --> 01:00:11.272
In other words, it approaches...

01:00:12.203 --> 01:00:13.702
The golden ratio.

01:00:13.713 --> 01:00:16.308
The root structure of life itself.

01:00:17.007 --> 01:00:21.856
Its coded secrets imprinted here.

01:00:27.850 --> 01:00:31.493
Forgive me, Mr. Bloom, but
your thesis is much changed.

01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:35.454
The entropy of the
universe tends to a maximum.

01:00:35.647 --> 01:00:38.627
Everything from the smaller
system to our entire world

01:00:38.638 --> 01:00:43.696
moves always, irretrievably,
from order to chaos.

01:00:43.697 --> 01:00:46.833
Your words stated to me.

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:50.566
And now I find that you
are seeking the root system

01:00:50.577 --> 01:00:55.146
not of that entropy but of a
divine order that you once denied.

01:00:58.628 --> 01:01:03.184
I am not as I was. It is true.

01:01:05.059 --> 01:01:06.259
Mister?

01:01:07.923 --> 01:01:09.123
Reid.

01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:13.751
Inspector Reid, as was.

01:01:19.954 --> 01:01:22.590
Mr. Bloom, do you know why you are here?

01:01:23.647 --> 01:01:26.207
What it is that you
have been sentenced for?

01:01:28.123 --> 01:01:30.982
The guilt that men assume is yours?

01:01:33.367 --> 01:01:36.280
Do you know what it is
awaits you in this place?

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:46.157
I... I hope you will return
and talk with me again.

01:01:46.957 --> 01:01:52.861
It is rare here to find someone
with whom I might share my work.

01:01:54.747 --> 01:01:55.947
I shall.

01:01:58.787 --> 01:02:02.438
And perhaps I might
share a puzzle of my own.

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:30.664
You are fixed to that
view today, Miss Susan.

01:02:31.518 --> 01:02:33.567
It is of interest to me today.

01:02:33.578 --> 01:02:34.997
Of course.

01:02:35.008 --> 01:02:37.391
It must go hard to think...

01:02:39.063 --> 01:02:44.285
well, to know that you will not feel
that free sky above you after all.

01:02:44.296 --> 01:02:47.492
- Do you gloat, Doctor?
- No.

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:53.691
Perhaps a little.

01:02:54.987 --> 01:02:58.420
Perhaps I am in fact relieved that the 55

01:02:58.431 --> 01:03:01.748
souls you accounted for
will now have their justice.

01:03:02.682 --> 01:03:06.741
It, ah... it had been
troubling me, I, ah, do confess.

01:03:07.229 --> 01:03:11.359
Well, I am glad to have removed
such disquiet from your conscience.

01:03:11.881 --> 01:03:16.075
I wonder, will you offer
a prayer for my soul

01:03:16.086 --> 01:03:20.682
in return, as you stand over my
corpse and confirm my passing?

01:03:20.693 --> 01:03:22.329
- Oh, I shall.
- Hmm.

01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:26.686
Perhaps also stand at
that commoner's boneyard,

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.333
offer greeting to that husband of yours,

01:03:29.344 --> 01:03:32.516
as he does what he can to comfort your boy.

01:03:51.052 --> 01:03:52.539
No, God damn you.

01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:36.897
By my reckoning, I'd say you were set
on one form of mischief or another.

01:04:40.321 --> 01:04:42.986
You send no news. You
don't answer your mail.

01:04:42.997 --> 01:04:45.551
- You send none.
- I don't speak for myself.

01:04:47.507 --> 01:04:50.531
He's quite the crestfallen
soldier for awhile or so.

01:04:51.247 --> 01:04:54.876
But as you say, I am not the
strike of a man for nostalgia,

01:04:54.887 --> 01:04:58.235
not then, not now. So if you forgive me,
Reid, I've got bad business to attend.

01:04:58.238 --> 01:05:00.073
Do you have any objection
to my walking with you?

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:02.395
- Plenty.
- Then call a policeman.

01:05:05.677 --> 01:05:07.298
The sea air is agreeable, Reid.

01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:09.344
It's brought out of the
well-fed plutocrat in you.

01:05:09.355 --> 01:05:12.355
- That is silver in your beard, is it not?
- It is grey, Reid.

01:05:12.366 --> 01:05:14.215
Silver, I'd be drawing a pension.

01:05:15.237 --> 01:05:16.957
- Social visit?
- It is not.

01:05:16.968 --> 01:05:18.848
Well, why don't you
state your business, Reid?

01:05:18.859 --> 01:05:21.516
Midsummer it may be, but the day is short.

01:05:21.517 --> 01:05:23.162
Isaac Bloom.

01:05:27.047 --> 01:05:28.283
Yeah, sentenced to hang.

01:05:28.294 --> 01:05:30.276
- On your conviction.
- Not mine, Reid, not mine.

01:05:30.287 --> 01:05:32.099
You conducted the
autopsy. You assembled the

01:05:32.110 --> 01:05:35.099
- forensical evidence for your inspector.
- I did.

01:05:36.511 --> 01:05:38.666
But why, Reid? Why the care?

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:41.038
You miss this all so much?

01:05:42.107 --> 01:05:43.991
- The care was asked of me.
- Who by?

01:05:44.002 --> 01:05:46.089
- Well, it doesn't matter.
- Oh, it doesn't, does it?

01:05:47.237 --> 01:05:49.798
- He was my friend.
- So was Drake, Reid.

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.010
I don't see you giving one snide
farthing for his well-being.

01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:55.125
Bennet Drake is not one
day's grace from the hangman.

01:05:55.136 --> 01:05:56.779
Should he find you lurking about the place,

01:05:56.790 --> 01:05:58.906
however putting that
mistrustful mind of yours

01:05:58.907 --> 01:06:01.634
to the querying of his
professional conduct,

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:05.404
no man was ever more loyal
to another than he to you,

01:06:05.415 --> 01:06:07.305
but I think that even he
would be moved to your injuring

01:06:07.316 --> 01:06:09.674
- in such a circumstance.
- Which is why I ask you.

01:06:09.685 --> 01:06:10.904
Excuse me.

01:06:11.224 --> 01:06:13.735
Do you pay my wages? You do not. He does.

01:06:15.157 --> 01:06:17.765
And it's a poor assumption of
yours that this faithlessness

01:06:17.776 --> 01:06:20.781
you imagine so ingrained in
me would by one simple tug

01:06:20.792 --> 01:06:22.802
on my tit sell Drake out to you,

01:06:23.662 --> 01:06:27.534
a man who all here thought had now
ascended to loftier company altogether.

01:06:27.537 --> 01:06:29.756
No, Reid, why don't you
find yourself another pigeon.

01:06:29.757 --> 01:06:31.546
You follow me, I'm gonna shoot you.

01:06:59.197 --> 01:07:02.298
You are a sneaky fellow, American.

01:07:03.007 --> 01:07:06.197
I do not like sneaky fellows, in truth.

01:07:13.365 --> 01:07:16.457
Now, this, I imagine, is
that elephant horn purported

01:07:16.468 --> 01:07:18.535
thieved from the customs house.

01:07:19.447 --> 01:07:21.197
I prefer liberated.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:23.408
That place, they burn it all, you know,

01:07:23.857 --> 01:07:25.627
if the crown's duty is not paid.

01:07:25.638 --> 01:07:29.213
Why shouldn't an honest wharfinger not
profit from such thriftless squandering?

01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:30.445
Why, indeed?

01:07:32.957 --> 01:07:35.213
Because you thieve from the Queen, Abel.

01:07:35.517 --> 01:07:38.447
- Act for that good lady, do you?
- On occasion.

01:07:38.448 --> 01:07:41.222
- Sporting which colour?
- Blue.

01:07:44.087 --> 01:07:47.146
I'm Inspector Drake's
surgeon over at Leman Street.

01:07:47.147 --> 01:07:52.661
Do your fire your cannons
across my bow, Captain Jackson?

01:07:53.217 --> 01:07:58.188
I cannot imagine for why, when
you owe me one sovereign tonne

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:02.611
for the berth to New York City I
have brokered, in no little secrecy,

01:08:02.622 --> 01:08:05.319
for you, and your wife, and child.

01:08:07.027 --> 01:08:08.939
I had assumed you came to settle,

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:11.506
but your current manner suggests otherwise.

01:08:11.507 --> 01:08:14.048
Do you cancel your billet therefore?

01:08:15.215 --> 01:08:16.758
I hope not to.

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:21.367
Yeah, yeah.

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:25.648
Christ, Abel, what is this stuff?

01:08:25.658 --> 01:08:26.859
Turmeric.

01:08:27.127 --> 01:08:31.576
Trot it down with some onions,
diced side of bacon, hot stock,

01:08:31.577 --> 01:08:32.777
good eating.

01:08:33.787 --> 01:08:35.555
But the staining,

01:08:36.426 --> 01:08:38.131
it is the very devil.

01:08:42.381 --> 01:08:44.926
But enough of my galley skills.

01:08:44.926 --> 01:08:47.645
I should like my cash spending from you.

01:08:47.647 --> 01:08:51.220
I, ah... I don't have it.

01:08:51.232 --> 01:08:55.095
Oh, but I have laid out, Captain,

01:08:55.307 --> 01:08:57.413
therefore you must also. Them's the rules.

01:08:57.425 --> 01:09:01.799
I thought to do so in an
alternative currency, however,

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:05.406
until I can hand you
those hundred sovereigns.

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:13.270
Then name your tender.

01:09:15.033 --> 01:09:16.234
Knowledge.

01:09:18.596 --> 01:09:20.861
By way of example, I might
be able to share with you

01:09:20.872 --> 01:09:23.455
the timing of when the true blue
men at Leman Street themselves

01:09:23.466 --> 01:09:27.205
go hunting for elephant
horn or other such booty.

01:09:27.216 --> 01:09:30.420
We transact under
different terms, therefore.

01:09:30.430 --> 01:09:33.636
Well, we... we renegotiate the terms.

01:09:34.497 --> 01:09:36.929
Those being, Captain?

01:09:38.566 --> 01:09:39.765
_

01:09:39.777 --> 01:09:44.836
You, Mr. Drake, you think the
man correct in his suspicions?

01:09:47.127 --> 01:09:48.845
This man, Constantine,

01:09:49.706 --> 01:09:51.933
I know him not a good man, sir,

01:09:52.716 --> 01:09:55.674
and most every thought
he ever had an evil one.

01:09:55.875 --> 01:09:59.134
But this... what my son...

01:10:01.148 --> 01:10:03.496
what Sayid has written

01:10:03.497 --> 01:10:07.056
is not only evil thoughts,
he has written them.

01:10:07.057 --> 01:10:08.676
He has proclaimed them.

01:10:08.677 --> 01:10:10.616
Major, we understand, do we not,

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:13.836
the difference between thinking
a thing and doing a thing?

01:10:14.267 --> 01:10:17.704
That it is action which
makes matter real, not ideas.

01:10:17.715 --> 01:10:20.749
Yet, I do not think such ideas came to him

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:23.306
without the influence of Imran Hafeez,

01:10:23.307 --> 01:10:25.635
his death, therefore, similarly so.

01:10:25.646 --> 01:10:29.725
Well, Mr. Hafeez, he is the
thinking kind, not the doing kind.

01:10:30.277 --> 01:10:33.438
This man, Constantine,
he wishes to torture him.

01:10:33.449 --> 01:10:34.774
You understand?

01:10:35.757 --> 01:10:39.527
Ideas do not merit such
a fate, not in my opinion.

01:10:42.767 --> 01:10:44.953
He will not talk to me, Major.

01:10:46.657 --> 01:10:48.572
And I believe he might to you.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:23.088
_

01:11:45.598 --> 01:11:49.177
_

01:12:12.598 --> 01:12:14.638
_

01:12:42.898 --> 01:12:44.098
Christ.

01:13:01.649 --> 01:13:05.976
It is good of you, Rose, to
come at such rapid request.

01:13:06.623 --> 01:13:08.717
Of course, Susan.

01:13:09.575 --> 01:13:13.129
You are forever my friend.

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:17.038
Then I am indeed fortunate, as is my son.

01:13:18.047 --> 01:13:22.508
I do not know what spell I've been beneath
to have neglected the thought for so long,

01:13:23.336 --> 01:13:25.308
but I am awake now, Rose,

01:13:25.570 --> 01:13:27.383
and awoken to a horror...

01:13:28.062 --> 01:13:29.904
What horror, Susan?

01:13:30.847 --> 01:13:33.297
What is to become of my boy?

01:13:35.877 --> 01:13:39.397
Rose, I do not think his
father can care of him,

01:13:39.842 --> 01:13:45.224
or at least that the thought
of that does not ease my fear.

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:49.282
He is not equipped, in my opinion.

01:13:51.621 --> 01:13:56.770
Then, Rose, where else will there
be for him but the workhouse?

01:14:00.697 --> 01:14:07.950
Well, there is one home I might think of.

01:14:08.391 --> 01:14:09.640
There is?

01:14:12.722 --> 01:14:14.061
Ours.

01:14:14.871 --> 01:14:16.111
Yours?

01:14:18.507 --> 01:14:23.434
Oh, I would love him,
love him fierce, Susan.

01:14:24.102 --> 01:14:26.890
Love him because he is himself, but...

01:14:27.922 --> 01:14:31.332
all the more because he is you also.

01:14:32.147 --> 01:14:37.308
And I will forever keep him
in mind of the truth of you,

01:14:38.819 --> 01:14:40.176
my friend...

01:14:43.184 --> 01:14:46.417
not no woman out there
who won't hold you to be.

01:14:49.977 --> 01:14:52.732
The woman that Mr. Drake
holds me to be, Rose.

01:14:53.696 --> 01:14:59.386
No, Bennet Drake will do
and behave as I instruct.

01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:03.505
You may trust in that.

01:15:56.147 --> 01:15:58.305
- Mrs. Drake.
- Hello, Drum.

01:15:58.521 --> 01:15:59.880
Is he here?

01:16:00.847 --> 01:16:02.089
He is.

01:16:02.926 --> 01:16:04.126
Rose.

01:16:18.851 --> 01:16:22.328
Jesus Christ, what's the
purpose of such machinery

01:16:22.348 --> 01:16:23.548
- if it cannot be...
- Everything's all right,

01:16:23.559 --> 01:16:24.759
innit?

01:16:25.427 --> 01:16:27.798
Bennet, I have kept secrets from you.

01:16:27.809 --> 01:16:29.359
Okay, this should be good.

01:16:35.707 --> 01:16:36.931
Well?

01:16:38.427 --> 01:16:40.724
Best you get it off your chest then, Rose.

01:16:40.967 --> 01:16:44.528
Once a week, sometimes twice,

01:16:45.485 --> 01:16:48.264
I have lied to you on the
subject of where I've been.

01:16:50.687 --> 01:16:54.991
Newgate, Bennet, in the
gaol there with Miss Susan.

01:16:55.497 --> 01:16:56.700
You what, Rose?

01:16:56.711 --> 01:16:59.869
Now, Bennet, you swallow
that rage of yours.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:02.747
Firstly, it's not as if I
announce your cuckoldings here.

01:17:02.758 --> 01:17:05.263
Second, I'm not even
close to getting started.

01:17:06.137 --> 01:17:09.230
We wish for a child, you and I.

01:17:10.171 --> 01:17:12.583
- Well, we do, but...
- No... Bennet!

01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:16.281
You are the one in a press, so the
quicker I say this and you agree,

01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:17.887
the quicker you may be back at it.

01:17:17.898 --> 01:17:20.125
Well, you tell me what it
is I'm agreeing to, then.

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:21.868
I am trying, Bennet.

01:17:26.677 --> 01:17:30.004
There is a little boy we could have,

01:17:30.856 --> 01:17:32.867
one who lives already,

01:17:34.077 --> 01:17:37.656
one who is in desperate need
of us to give him a home,

01:17:37.657 --> 01:17:41.814
to protect him, a little boy who...

01:17:46.677 --> 01:17:48.151
Her boy, you mean?

01:17:49.781 --> 01:17:53.172
She asks it of us.

01:17:58.100 --> 01:17:59.600
What is it she calls him?

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:02.462
Connor...

01:18:04.519 --> 01:18:05.879
Judge.

01:18:07.037 --> 01:18:09.951
This boy Connor has a father, Rose.

01:18:09.962 --> 01:18:11.657
None that is any use to him.

01:18:12.667 --> 01:18:17.047
Not unless it is the skill to cheat at
a gaming table at 6:00 in the morning,

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:20.488
or shoot a bottle of rum of the
upturned behind of a musical hoofer,

01:18:20.499 --> 01:18:24.913
but not what it is to be a man,
Not the man you are, Bennet.

01:18:26.157 --> 01:18:30.288
I don't seem to recall you complaining
overly when it was your behind, darling.

01:18:32.537 --> 01:18:34.622
Slippery soul that you are.

01:18:35.567 --> 01:18:41.677
No, I will not have you
stand in judgement of me,

01:18:41.917 --> 01:18:43.436
not you of all.

01:18:43.447 --> 01:18:48.287
They are up there, Captain
Jackson, your wife, your child,

01:18:48.647 --> 01:18:52.526
and she, as you well know, soon to go
to her end, but yet you do not visit.

01:18:52.857 --> 01:18:54.857
You pay them no mind.

01:18:55.587 --> 01:18:59.142
Your son, your living flesh.

01:18:59.765 --> 01:19:00.965
Are you done?

01:19:04.744 --> 01:19:09.508
Ah... your man downstairs, he's
got staining about the wound.

01:19:09.519 --> 01:19:13.320
Now, at first I thought simply
contusion, discolouring therefore,

01:19:13.331 --> 01:19:17.242
but all these Indians... it was
caused by contact with turmeric.

01:19:18.069 --> 01:19:19.429
It's a spice. It's a powder.

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:21.219
So my thinking, it was about the cuffs

01:19:21.231 --> 01:19:24.280
or the wrists of the sleeve
as the knife was pulled across.

01:19:30.557 --> 01:19:32.068
- Bennet.
- Rose,

01:19:32.079 --> 01:19:34.697
as I said, the boy has a father.

01:19:35.057 --> 01:19:39.875
When the mother is gone, it
is up to Jackson to resolve.

01:19:40.165 --> 01:19:41.365
Right?

01:19:43.975 --> 01:19:45.175
Take him.

01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:12.126
This hatred of my empire and Queen,

01:20:12.127 --> 01:20:14.027
these were my son's true beliefs?

01:20:14.038 --> 01:20:16.197
They were, Major Al-Qadir.

01:20:16.758 --> 01:20:18.399
I cannot believe he came to them

01:20:18.410 --> 01:20:20.121
- without you.
- Hmm.

01:20:20.557 --> 01:20:23.500
And which beliefs did he
come to because of you?

01:20:24.477 --> 01:20:26.246
I am his father.

01:20:26.247 --> 01:20:28.066
That is a notional term, sir.

01:20:28.077 --> 01:20:29.469
You have a cheek.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:31.467
You always did.

01:20:33.557 --> 01:20:37.511
I recall the first time my
mother asked him to eat with us.

01:20:38.237 --> 01:20:40.676
He said I do not eat with my fingers.

01:20:40.677 --> 01:20:42.606
My mother asked him, why?

01:20:42.617 --> 01:20:45.206
He said my father says it is so.

01:20:45.217 --> 01:20:49.082
My mother asked him,
and where is your father?

01:20:49.481 --> 01:20:54.023
Sayid replied, he marches
to war in Kandahar.

01:20:54.387 --> 01:20:59.319
She asked him, who it was
would then rule in Afghanistan.

01:20:59.815 --> 01:21:03.805
He replied, why, the Empress Victoria.

01:21:08.054 --> 01:21:11.855
So we showed him how to eat with his hands

01:21:11.866 --> 01:21:13.446
while you were at war.

01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:21.838
If we believe another person
is wrong, which is worse?

01:21:22.842 --> 01:21:27.454
To persuade that person
with violence or with ideas?

01:21:28.786 --> 01:21:31.397
And if ideas bring men to violence,

01:21:31.683 --> 01:21:36.943
if these ideas of Sayid's
brought another to...

01:21:42.321 --> 01:21:44.962
Why will you not speak?

01:21:45.947 --> 01:21:48.711
Did you not care for him?

01:21:50.347 --> 01:21:51.813
Like a brother.

01:21:52.327 --> 01:21:53.951
And brothers fight.

01:22:00.287 --> 01:22:01.812
You are watched, Imran,

01:22:02.104 --> 01:22:06.064
by men, who, though, yes,
we serve the same Queen,

01:22:06.675 --> 01:22:08.679
I see no honour in them.

01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:13.175
Why did you fight with Sayid?

01:22:19.199 --> 01:22:25.176
I do not know who killed
your son, but yes, we fought.

01:22:25.977 --> 01:22:27.736
And we did so because...

01:22:30.127 --> 01:22:31.536
he stole.

01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:34.687
Your son was a thief.

01:22:43.335 --> 01:22:45.943
Hello, Nora. Thank you. Sorry, the time.

01:22:45.954 --> 01:22:47.485
No-no, it was quite all right, Edmund.

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:49.427
Valerie's spending the
evening with her grandfather.

01:22:49.438 --> 01:22:51.816
Besides, Mathilda and I
have been enjoying ourselves.

01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:01.789
Soot, Father?

01:23:07.597 --> 01:23:10.718
Mathilda reassured me
that there had been no...

01:23:11.684 --> 01:23:15.871
that that lady was accommodated
without any impropriety.

01:23:17.517 --> 01:23:21.913
But Edmund, you are unlike
any man I've ever known.

01:23:24.577 --> 01:23:26.687
Your kindness towards that poor creature,

01:23:26.698 --> 01:23:30.805
your refusal to reject your
past life in that place,

01:23:30.816 --> 01:23:33.147
that terrible, abject place,

01:23:34.953 --> 01:23:36.385
surely this,

01:23:36.706 --> 01:23:41.235
you and I here now, our girls,
surely this is your reward

01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:46.814
the longed for salving of your wounds.

01:23:55.377 --> 01:23:58.947
Dear Edmund, I... I know
you think me a proper woman

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:05.520
and you are a gallant man, but
desire is not a stranger to me.

01:24:05.812 --> 01:24:10.578
- Dear, do you... do you feel that desire?
- I do.

01:24:12.247 --> 01:24:14.537
Then I am yours. You know this.

01:24:18.757 --> 01:24:21.276
- W... why, here?!
- Here.

01:24:32.375 --> 01:24:33.600
Ah!

01:24:53.957 --> 01:24:55.508
Look at me, my love.

01:24:58.748 --> 01:25:00.273
Look at me, my love.

01:25:04.897 --> 01:25:06.409
Won't you look at me?

01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:09.811
Ah!

01:25:35.097 --> 01:25:39.156
They were zakah, Mr. Drake, alms.

01:25:39.157 --> 01:25:44.046
And it was almost 200 pounds, for the
Indian merchant seamen on the docks.

01:25:44.339 --> 01:25:45.762
- Lascars?
- Yes, sir.

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:48.274
Funds were raised to be distributed

01:25:48.285 --> 01:25:51.860
among those men who were
left without a ship to crew

01:25:51.871 --> 01:25:55.087
to ease their need.

01:25:56.982 --> 01:25:58.761
And, ah...

01:26:00.331 --> 01:26:02.995
my Sayid stole it.

01:26:06.482 --> 01:26:08.555
He steals the money meant for the lascars,

01:26:08.566 --> 01:26:10.007
- therefore they kill him.
- No.

01:26:10.018 --> 01:26:13.666
See here, a draft amendment
to the Merchant Shipping Act.

01:26:13.667 --> 01:26:17.975
Authors, Mr. R. Ahmad and Mr. SKA Al-Qadir.

01:26:18.237 --> 01:26:21.195
To give more robust and far
reaching legal protection

01:26:21.206 --> 01:26:23.415
in this country to the status
of those merchant seamen

01:26:23.426 --> 01:26:25.145
from the South Asian colonies.

01:26:25.347 --> 01:26:28.588
He, Mr. Hafeez also,
also they fight lascars.

01:26:28.688 --> 01:26:30.815
Now, this was a cornerstone
of his legal career.

01:26:30.886 --> 01:26:33.520
Why would he steal from them,
and why would they kill him?

01:26:34.457 --> 01:26:37.105
Please, Inspector, there
is a particular clause

01:26:37.116 --> 01:26:40.570
that by law they would then be allowed to
find other work whilst they remain here.

01:26:40.806 --> 01:26:45.134
That is cause for more than offence. There
are slim pickings down on those docks.

01:26:45.357 --> 01:26:47.456
And Mr. Sayid lobbied
that they be stretched

01:26:47.467 --> 01:26:51.322
even further to accommodate men
of both different colour and creed.

01:26:51.497 --> 01:26:53.693
Stevedores, lumpers, lightmen.

01:26:53.704 --> 01:26:56.136
All of whom may have cause
to handle a cargo of turmeric.

01:26:56.147 --> 01:26:59.217
But what of these 200 nicker, sir?

01:26:59.947 --> 01:27:01.309
Christ knows.

01:27:01.637 --> 01:27:04.623
Mr. Drummond, you will by morning

01:27:04.634 --> 01:27:07.389
have found each and every
shipment of South Asian spices

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:10.677
to have been lumped ashore between
St. Catherine's and the Isle of Dogs.

01:27:10.688 --> 01:27:13.569
Sergeant Thatcher, the bunkhouse
for foreign shipping crews

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.934
- on West India Dock Road.
- The stranger's home, sir?

01:27:15.944 --> 01:27:18.343
Yes, you and I are paying a visit.

01:27:18.567 --> 01:27:21.747
We shall see what those lascars
know about the thief, Potter Chowdey.

01:27:21.758 --> 01:27:24.149
Inspector Drake, sir, if I may.

01:27:24.807 --> 01:27:27.823
DS Thatcher has many admirable qualities,

01:27:27.834 --> 01:27:31.638
but I'm not sure the
speaking of Urdu is one.

01:27:33.092 --> 01:27:35.672
You crowing cock, Drum.

01:27:36.044 --> 01:27:38.073
Do you want that snide
little nose of yours broke?

01:27:38.084 --> 01:27:40.945
Come now, Sergeant. We are one uniform.

01:27:42.798 --> 01:27:45.046
Major, would you consider...

01:27:45.997 --> 01:27:49.000
Word from the top, Inspector Drake.

01:27:49.557 --> 01:27:52.096
Colonial Secretary Chamberlain himself,

01:27:52.525 --> 01:27:54.441
you are to release your prisoner to me.

01:28:10.517 --> 01:28:12.535
I would not have had it happen this way.

01:28:23.337 --> 01:28:26.987
If I learn that this man
has been injured or harmed

01:28:26.998 --> 01:28:32.412
in any way, your Secretary
Chamberlain shall hear from me, sir.

01:28:34.307 --> 01:28:37.033
And you imagine he shall
give two tosses, do you?

01:28:37.044 --> 01:28:39.899
He's the colonial secretary,
and you're the colonial.

01:28:40.757 --> 01:28:43.851
You are to him no more
than a trained circus pony.

01:28:44.627 --> 01:28:46.339
Best you understand that.

01:28:47.357 --> 01:28:49.123
Here is the lesson, Major.

01:28:50.387 --> 01:28:54.150
They dress you in this costume

01:28:54.161 --> 01:28:56.948
and puff you full of a
confected self-importance,

01:28:56.959 --> 01:28:59.273
the purpose of which is only this...

01:28:59.566 --> 01:29:04.251
that we here in this country may
slowly bleed your country dry,

01:29:04.819 --> 01:29:07.798
whilst your back is turned,
parading in our honour.

01:29:10.124 --> 01:29:11.471
Now...

01:29:13.282 --> 01:29:17.636
I shall be taking this
little insurrectionist

01:29:18.198 --> 01:29:19.990
and putting him under the boot.

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:26.602
Mr. Drake, there is not a thing to be done.

01:29:27.287 --> 01:29:29.376
There may be now, however.

01:29:29.377 --> 01:29:32.043
We will show our special branch

01:29:32.054 --> 01:29:34.849
that they are dogs barking
up the wrong tree entirely.

01:29:35.887 --> 01:29:39.620
Mr. Drummond, those dockside
work gangs, get to the wires.

01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:42.871
Sergeant Thatcher. Major Al-Qadir, sir,

01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.223
with me, if you please.

01:30:44.227 --> 01:30:47.842
The spice shipments, Assistant
Commissioner, all those from South India.

01:30:47.853 --> 01:30:49.749
There were five in the last
fortnight, and these are names

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.512
of those men to lead those work gangs.

01:30:52.557 --> 01:30:55.021
One such name chimes heavy with me, sir.

01:30:55.957 --> 01:30:57.596
And which one is that, Sergeant?

01:30:58.485 --> 01:30:59.777
Teague.

01:31:00.017 --> 01:31:01.897
He's a union steward.

01:31:02.367 --> 01:31:04.088
One moment, if you will, sir.

01:31:15.128 --> 01:31:17.459
His daughter, Kay Teague,

01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:20.255
she threw herself over the dock gates
at the Western only this morning.

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.959
- That is rich coincidence, Mr. Drummond.
- Is it not, sir?

01:31:23.247 --> 01:31:24.527
See the news communicated

01:31:24.538 --> 01:31:25.934
- to Inspector Drake.
- I will, sir.

01:31:25.945 --> 01:31:28.537
Reassure him that I myself
will investigate these others.

01:31:28.548 --> 01:31:30.280
Very good, Assistant Commissioner.

01:31:36.217 --> 01:31:39.459
He says that, ah, he and
many of the other men here,

01:31:39.470 --> 01:31:44.226
that they knew my Sayid, but that all
they understood of him was solidarity,

01:31:44.227 --> 01:31:46.579
his love for his own people.

01:31:52.247 --> 01:31:55.215
If this man stole, he did
so with love in his heart,

01:31:55.226 --> 01:31:58.994
and only to give to
another in greater need.

01:31:59.727 --> 01:32:04.553
And does he have any indication as
to whose that greater need might be?

01:32:20.468 --> 01:32:26.533
It is thought Sayid had a
lover here, who he met here.

01:32:27.374 --> 01:32:32.523
He says... um... he says
she is a white woman.

01:32:34.648 --> 01:32:36.317
Roy Teague's daughter?

01:32:38.957 --> 01:32:40.523
We have a testimony here.

01:32:40.534 --> 01:32:42.858
Says there is a young white
woman who shared intimacies

01:32:42.869 --> 01:32:44.769
with Major Al-Qadir's son.

01:32:46.507 --> 01:32:47.785
Understood, Sergeant.

01:32:47.796 --> 01:32:49.716
Give my thanks to Mr. Dove.

01:32:52.427 --> 01:32:54.535
There is a wake we must attend.

01:33:14.532 --> 01:33:16.877
- Is Roy Teague here?
- No, sir.

01:33:16.878 --> 01:33:19.071
He could not bear the sight and bolted.

01:34:38.004 --> 01:34:39.504
Ah...!

01:34:40.478 --> 01:34:43.786
What trouble brings you
here, young Mr. Dove?

01:34:43.787 --> 01:34:46.458
I've a worry which roots
itself in these parts.

01:34:46.469 --> 01:34:48.516
Why, you surprise me.

01:34:50.877 --> 01:34:54.439
This is that Indian fellow which
washed ashore at the Western then?

01:34:54.628 --> 01:34:57.615
This Indian nurtured opinions...

01:34:58.048 --> 01:35:00.468
- on this country, on its ruler,
- Ugh...

01:35:00.479 --> 01:35:03.099
she who will soon pass
not too far from here.

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.871
You know I only had opinions, Abel.

01:35:08.097 --> 01:35:10.496
He had stolen 200 sterling, also.

01:35:10.497 --> 01:35:11.986
Two tonnes?

01:35:12.995 --> 01:35:15.618
Your masters fear some plot afoot, do they?

01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:17.191
I believe it fear alone.

01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:20.708
Yeah, well...

01:35:20.877 --> 01:35:26.073
But there are other
indications bring me down here.

01:35:27.877 --> 01:35:29.687
Spice cargoes...

01:35:32.003 --> 01:35:33.437
turmeric...

01:35:34.488 --> 01:35:37.206
the work gangs who brought
such shipments ashore.

01:35:37.207 --> 01:35:38.888
And my name among them.

01:35:38.899 --> 01:35:41.746
It was not you nor none of your own

01:35:41.757 --> 01:35:43.696
who opened the man's throat for him?

01:35:45.257 --> 01:35:47.853
It was not me, Augustus.

01:35:54.617 --> 01:35:58.646
There is not one atom of
life, human or otherwise,

01:35:58.647 --> 01:36:02.214
which lands on this stretch of water
without that you know its nature.

01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:03.955
This is true.

01:36:06.935 --> 01:36:09.221
Then what is at the root of this, Abel.

01:36:09.232 --> 01:36:10.432
Well...

01:36:11.657 --> 01:36:14.170
- 200 pounds gone missing, you say?
- _

01:36:17.277 --> 01:36:20.145
No need to unsettle yourself, my lad.

01:36:20.737 --> 01:36:26.596
This is not some grand foreign
plot, but local mischief.

01:36:26.597 --> 01:36:31.446
And you, despite all,
are no longer a local boy.

01:36:37.827 --> 01:36:41.151
Have I ever done all but
truth and right by you?

01:36:44.717 --> 01:36:47.406
You leave doctor's orders to dock folk.

01:37:20.290 --> 01:37:21.490
Golem!

01:37:22.321 --> 01:37:23.656
Stop! Wait!

01:37:23.667 --> 01:37:25.122
Golem's back!

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:37.976
Goren, Goren, Deborah Goren.

01:37:37.987 --> 01:37:39.406
Deborah Goren?

01:37:39.764 --> 01:37:41.613
Ah... the orphanage.

01:37:41.624 --> 01:37:43.836
Ah....

01:37:43.847 --> 01:37:46.530
She will speak for me.
She will speak for me.

01:37:53.332 --> 01:37:54.734
Respect.

01:37:58.358 --> 01:38:00.284
Please, calm yourselves.

01:38:00.295 --> 01:38:02.731
My friends, please, calm yourselves!

01:38:02.742 --> 01:38:05.044
He was there because I invited him!

01:38:05.054 --> 01:38:07.760
- I invited him!
- Why would you invite

01:38:07.771 --> 01:38:11.586
Edmund Reid, inspector as he was,

01:38:11.587 --> 01:38:15.074
into the rooms of Isaac Bloom?

01:38:17.231 --> 01:38:18.431
Why, Deborah?

01:38:18.442 --> 01:38:21.026
He is a friend to Isaac, as am I.

01:38:21.027 --> 01:38:23.750
I offer my apologies for them, sir.

01:38:23.761 --> 01:38:25.463
You are unknown to them.

01:38:26.267 --> 01:38:27.994
Myself, however...

01:38:29.105 --> 01:38:30.906
Max Steiner.

01:38:30.907 --> 01:38:32.958
I understood you had their London.

01:38:32.969 --> 01:38:34.349
I had. I have.

01:38:34.467 --> 01:38:37.535
Mr. Reid and I, we share, I hope,

01:38:37.546 --> 01:38:40.342
a fear that Isaac's
conviction may be unsafe.

01:38:40.723 --> 01:38:41.966
Is that true?

01:38:42.557 --> 01:38:45.886
I had, er... I had hoped to investigate.

01:38:45.887 --> 01:38:48.427
Well, then you do know that only a week

01:38:48.438 --> 01:38:53.656
prior to the murder or Ratovski,
Isaac set upon another rabbi.

01:38:55.917 --> 01:38:58.650
That other rabbi was myself, Mr. Reid.

01:38:59.347 --> 01:39:04.504
I visited him to inquire if
he may need some help from me.

01:39:05.077 --> 01:39:11.412
He answered that he needed no
help, because he had found God.

01:39:12.065 --> 01:39:14.613
I replied that this was a good thing,

01:39:14.624 --> 01:39:19.296
but no, he tells me he
does not talk about belief,

01:39:19.297 --> 01:39:23.757
but that he has actually found him.

01:39:23.977 --> 01:39:26.256
I warned him that false prophecy

01:39:26.257 --> 01:39:30.329
was a grave sin, at which he laughed,

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.603
knocked me to the ground and kicked me.

01:39:33.285 --> 01:39:35.250
I imagine you have told
all this to Mr. Drake.

01:39:35.261 --> 01:39:36.461
I did.

01:39:37.737 --> 01:39:44.372
Golem?

01:39:44.383 --> 01:39:46.486
No, that was never proved, never.

01:39:46.497 --> 01:39:47.697
What does he say?

01:39:47.708 --> 01:39:49.784
There's a belief in the community

01:39:49.795 --> 01:39:52.087
that it's being haunted by a monster.

01:39:52.474 --> 01:39:53.732
Golem.

01:39:54.517 --> 01:39:56.216
What gave them this belief.

01:39:56.217 --> 01:40:00.047
Well, they said that children
awoke with a dark figure

01:40:00.058 --> 01:40:03.374
standing over their beds, an
etching scratched in the walls,

01:40:03.385 --> 01:40:05.526
the jaws of savage creatures. Er...

01:40:05.527 --> 01:40:08.257
On occasion, they thought
they had trapped it,

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:12.427
but it was strong and fast,
and leapt from roof to roof.

01:40:12.438 --> 01:40:14.489
And this, they believe to have been Bloom?

01:40:15.307 --> 01:40:16.679
Yes, they believe.

01:40:24.387 --> 01:40:26.739
It's perfect, you see?

01:40:27.797 --> 01:40:29.336
If you had known what you had done,

01:40:29.347 --> 01:40:32.632
I would have hailed it a master stroke.

01:40:33.289 --> 01:40:36.743
The boy'll be safe, cared for while we,

01:40:36.896 --> 01:40:39.206
you know, reassemble ourselves.

01:40:39.217 --> 01:40:42.196
- How will this reassembling take place?
- Yeah, it's all under good control.

01:40:42.197 --> 01:40:46.458
But then once we are prepared,
all we have to do is take him.

01:40:46.469 --> 01:40:48.982
From Rose? It would kill her.

01:40:48.993 --> 01:40:51.203
That is a metaphor, darling.

01:40:52.288 --> 01:40:55.724
The killing that comes
your way, that ain't.

01:40:57.050 --> 01:41:00.078
Do you understand what
you raise in me, Matthew?

01:41:00.247 --> 01:41:03.507
- If this absurd plot of yours fails...
- It won't.

01:41:03.518 --> 01:41:05.034
Well, if it does...

01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:09.786
I will not spend my last day on
Earth in vain, desperate hope.

01:41:09.797 --> 01:41:12.367
No, you will.

01:41:12.747 --> 01:41:15.692
You have faith in me, Caitlin.

01:41:16.506 --> 01:41:18.340
Not a single night in three years

01:41:18.351 --> 01:41:20.606
have I climbed into my
bed and not dreamt of what

01:41:20.617 --> 01:41:22.188
it would be to smell you there.

01:41:22.199 --> 01:41:25.641
Do you think that I'm gonna let
the world steal that from me?

01:41:27.577 --> 01:41:29.256
You think again.

01:41:30.017 --> 01:41:33.840
We have no funds with which
to run, and I will be hunted.

01:41:33.851 --> 01:41:36.791
Don't you see, darling? That's
entirely the beauty of it.

01:41:37.168 --> 01:41:38.746
But the man, Probyn.

01:41:39.044 --> 01:41:42.116
It is he who must confirm
that the hangman's job is done,

01:41:42.283 --> 01:41:44.391
and the bond we had,
surely it is broken now.

01:41:44.402 --> 01:41:46.007
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:41:47.007 --> 01:41:48.629
You're gonna leave Probyn to me.

01:41:53.458 --> 01:41:54.850
Guns and horses.

01:42:04.612 --> 01:42:05.812
Ah...

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:09.723
Come on in, Roy.

01:42:11.367 --> 01:42:14.910
Take a seat and a drink.

01:42:20.805 --> 01:42:22.005
Yeah...

01:42:34.602 --> 01:42:37.729
No doubt this has been quite
the ugliest of days for you.

01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:39.634
Our condolences for your daughter.

01:42:39.645 --> 01:42:41.512
I will take the drink, Croker.

01:42:41.832 --> 01:42:44.079
I don't think I'll trust you enough to sit.

01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:45.512
Fair enough answer.

01:42:47.438 --> 01:42:48.710
Do you have it?

01:42:51.126 --> 01:42:53.274
Word is you have something urgent to relay

01:42:53.285 --> 01:42:56.808
to me on the subject of my Kay.

01:42:58.757 --> 01:43:02.765
Word is, Roy, you do not
hand that sack of money to me,

01:43:03.107 --> 01:43:04.811
I shall see the whole world apprised

01:43:04.822 --> 01:43:08.790
of who it was cut that Indian
gentleman's throat for him.

01:43:17.147 --> 01:43:19.613
Why would you do such a thing, Roy?

01:43:20.287 --> 01:43:22.461
Not for you to question what I do

01:43:22.588 --> 01:43:25.580
in the interest of my
family or my community.

01:43:27.492 --> 01:43:30.837
Oh, it is murdering has
clearly advanced the interests

01:43:30.848 --> 01:43:32.846
of both those constituents.

01:43:32.857 --> 01:43:35.352
Your community's
suffering every blue bottle

01:43:35.363 --> 01:43:38.791
this side of the Old Gate
Pub crawling up its fundament.

01:43:39.737 --> 01:43:42.158
And your family, well, Roy...

01:43:43.348 --> 01:43:47.805
it is masterful self-delusion to
think you have helped them one jot.

01:43:48.137 --> 01:43:50.475
That gold-skinned grandson of yours...

01:43:52.652 --> 01:43:54.347
where's his ma now?

01:43:57.770 --> 01:44:01.474
Phwoah, end of the year you were
always a hot head and a rabble-rouser,

01:44:01.485 --> 01:44:03.543
too eager for a moan and a bullhorn

01:44:03.554 --> 01:44:06.116
when a moment's contemplation might have

01:44:06.127 --> 01:44:08.214
brought you some perspective.

01:44:08.225 --> 01:44:10.708
But you are emotional,

01:44:11.770 --> 01:44:13.356
and you are political,

01:44:13.357 --> 01:44:17.208
always tossing on about
the rights of working man,

01:44:17.219 --> 01:44:20.860
and forgetting that the
rice-eaters and the coolies

01:44:20.871 --> 01:44:23.275
you hate so much, that
they too are working men.

01:44:23.286 --> 01:44:26.176
They are not of this city, and
they are not of this country.

01:44:26.337 --> 01:44:27.849
Men like that lawyer...

01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:30.936
Ah, the Mohammedan lad
that was up your Kay, him.

01:44:30.937 --> 01:44:32.475
Yes, him.

01:44:32.486 --> 01:44:35.017
And telling us we have to
compete for the same scraps

01:44:35.029 --> 01:44:37.715
as those murdering, moon-faced bastards!

01:44:39.445 --> 01:44:44.450
Ah, correct me if I'm wrong, it
is you what's done the murdering?

01:44:49.787 --> 01:44:52.322
In all truth, Roy, I knew it

01:44:52.333 --> 01:44:55.781
the moment you kicked up
such rage when I had Nate here

01:44:55.792 --> 01:44:58.196
wash him up at the Western.

01:45:02.312 --> 01:45:05.305
I do like me a pineapple. How about you?

01:45:07.608 --> 01:45:08.975
I like it good enough.

01:45:08.986 --> 01:45:10.186
Now,

01:45:11.408 --> 01:45:16.780
you see, this pineapple
is a lascar brought here

01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:19.224
on the world's ocean currents.

01:45:19.558 --> 01:45:21.853
Piece of fruit is not a man.

01:45:22.613 --> 01:45:27.055
But it... it provides
for a man, however, right?

01:45:27.066 --> 01:45:31.090
Its cultivation, its
shipping, its trade, and so...

01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:34.499
such fruits become part of our lives.

01:45:35.037 --> 01:45:38.596
Lascars, all their colour,
plenty more besides,

01:45:38.607 --> 01:45:43.528
they will all in good time,
likewise become as such.

01:45:43.539 --> 01:45:46.549
Not if working men in this city stay tight.

01:45:52.816 --> 01:45:56.344
Ah... you need to take a look about.

01:45:56.901 --> 01:45:58.908
There is a city out there...

01:45:59.281 --> 01:46:02.765
tuned to cheer its Queen as
she parades her way through it.

01:46:03.487 --> 01:46:05.216
But what is that Queen?

01:46:05.217 --> 01:46:11.708
She is an empress, but her
empire is not solely England, boy.

01:46:12.507 --> 01:46:13.925
It is the world.

01:46:14.407 --> 01:46:18.440
And therefore, the world comes to London,

01:46:18.549 --> 01:46:21.373
and London becomes the world.

01:46:21.837 --> 01:46:26.716
This is not because
Englishmen are good or pretty,

01:46:27.584 --> 01:46:31.640
but because we understood
quicker than all, good trade

01:46:32.207 --> 01:46:34.461
made for greater power.

01:46:35.556 --> 01:46:38.616
Power which you will always lack for,

01:46:38.617 --> 01:46:42.841
Roy, until you understand
that there is but one boat

01:46:42.852 --> 01:46:45.919
afloat in this world, and it is this.

01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:49.437
You roll for the future times...

01:46:50.366 --> 01:46:53.780
or the future times will roll over you.

01:47:00.897 --> 01:47:03.593
It was a Burmese silk
captain showed me that.

01:47:04.356 --> 01:47:06.034
Slip a knife between a man's ribs

01:47:06.045 --> 01:47:08.444
without him even feeling it.

01:47:12.617 --> 01:47:14.553
See what a man might learn

01:47:14.564 --> 01:47:17.183
if he opens his heart to the world, Roy?

01:47:26.407 --> 01:47:29.941
But you, as we know,
are an ignorant fellow.

01:47:30.767 --> 01:47:33.264
A man of the riverside, and yet you

01:47:33.275 --> 01:47:34.929
cannot so much as place a dead man

01:47:34.940 --> 01:47:37.906
in that river and get him lost.

01:47:37.907 --> 01:47:40.901
You need to weigh the cargo down, Roy,

01:47:41.357 --> 01:47:43.469
and let your tide help you through.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:46.057
Nate here knows how.

01:47:46.637 --> 01:47:49.780
I showed him. Yeah.

01:47:52.427 --> 01:47:55.031
You are going deep, my friend,

01:47:56.052 --> 01:48:01.022
out into the estuary,
the black river mouth,

01:48:03.688 --> 01:48:06.518
the belly of the seas beyond.

01:48:41.157 --> 01:48:43.483
You're the husband, are you not?

01:48:44.127 --> 01:48:45.571
I am, Doctor.

01:48:46.008 --> 01:48:47.373
What is it you want?

01:48:47.833 --> 01:48:51.542
Have you, er... you found the wherewithal?

01:48:52.157 --> 01:48:53.439
Of a kind.

01:48:56.046 --> 01:48:57.789
Well, I'll show you if you ask nice.

01:49:06.508 --> 01:49:09.338
Shh! Shhh!

01:49:11.647 --> 01:49:13.203
You got a wife, Probyn?

01:49:13.782 --> 01:49:15.072
You love her?

01:49:15.492 --> 01:49:18.416
- Mmm.
- Well, mine I love.

01:49:18.417 --> 01:49:20.423
And the thought that I
would let a white boiled egg

01:49:20.434 --> 01:49:21.930
such as yourself stop me from living

01:49:21.941 --> 01:49:25.564
out my days with her, well,
what kind of man would I be?

01:49:27.697 --> 01:49:29.059
Say what?

01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:32.357
Oh, what do I want? Well, I want you
to help her as you contracted to do.

01:49:35.117 --> 01:49:37.622
Are you really gonna quibble
with a pistol in your mouth?

01:49:37.633 --> 01:49:40.546
You don't do this, I will kill you.

01:49:40.547 --> 01:49:41.926
How does that sound?

01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:49.406
There is no time, however.

01:49:49.407 --> 01:49:52.167
It... it is but hours
away. I... I... I can't.

01:49:52.178 --> 01:49:54.758
The men...... the laundry.

01:49:54.769 --> 01:49:56.279
The plan cannot work.

01:49:56.290 --> 01:49:58.025
Well, there's a new plan, however.

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:01.627
Now, it's you the prison governor's

01:50:01.638 --> 01:50:03.374
gonna look to for
confirmation of her death,

01:50:03.385 --> 01:50:05.175
- correct?
- Uh-huh.

01:50:12.007 --> 01:50:13.413
Mr. Bloom.

01:50:13.974 --> 01:50:15.212
Mr. Bloom.

01:50:18.277 --> 01:50:20.047
Do you know a man named Steiner?

01:50:20.124 --> 01:50:22.066
He is a rabbi in Whitechapel.

01:50:22.067 --> 01:50:23.899
He says you assaulted him.

01:50:24.113 --> 01:50:25.327
Did you?

01:50:25.328 --> 01:50:27.336
He would not allow my work.

01:50:27.716 --> 01:50:30.486
And my work is nothing if
it is not in support of him.

01:50:30.497 --> 01:50:32.321
He would not see this!

01:50:35.092 --> 01:50:36.917
Eh... I know, sir.

01:50:37.243 --> 01:50:39.160
I see the way you look at me, but you

01:50:39.171 --> 01:50:40.712
need not concern yourself.

01:50:40.723 --> 01:50:42.911
I feel the regret. I feel the shame.

01:50:43.077 --> 01:50:44.863
Will you explain something to me, sir?

01:50:45.144 --> 01:50:47.718
- If I can.
- What is a golem?

01:50:47.818 --> 01:50:49.915
Um, may mean many things.

01:50:50.307 --> 01:50:53.095
An unformed being of
human shape, but not human,

01:50:53.106 --> 01:50:56.717
a monster made by other
men to protect or attack.

01:50:56.907 --> 01:50:58.861
Not evil, neither good.

01:50:59.077 --> 01:51:01.997
The children of Whitechapel
report seeing such a being, sir,

01:51:02.318 --> 01:51:05.550
a dark figure entering
the rooms of the young,

01:51:05.561 --> 01:51:07.133
leaping from rooftops.

01:51:07.144 --> 01:51:09.418
My people have avid imaginations.

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:13.072
Your people now imagine that
figure to be yourself, Mr. Bloom.

01:51:13.694 --> 01:51:15.358
But I am not strong.

01:51:15.369 --> 01:51:17.512
I have no athleticism.

01:51:17.523 --> 01:51:20.397
Why would I seek to frighten children?

01:51:20.408 --> 01:51:21.886
I... I am occupied!

01:51:21.897 --> 01:51:24.585
Do you know a man named
Ratovski, a rabbi, also.

01:51:24.596 --> 01:51:25.916
Of course.

01:51:26.139 --> 01:51:29.488
Leon Ratovski's work on vector spaces

01:51:29.499 --> 01:51:31.470
has been deeply influential, but...

01:51:31.705 --> 01:51:34.320
but he... he is dead.

01:51:34.331 --> 01:51:36.343
- How is he dead?
- He... he is killed.

01:51:36.354 --> 01:51:37.554
At whose hand?

01:51:38.077 --> 01:51:39.917
I believe you play games with me.

01:51:39.928 --> 01:51:41.193
Then tell me.

01:51:41.577 --> 01:51:44.706
By my hand, so it is said.

01:51:44.707 --> 01:51:45.907
And do you deny it?

01:51:46.092 --> 01:51:48.041
I was not believed.

01:51:48.052 --> 01:51:52.021
- Will you deny it now?
- What is the use?

01:51:52.032 --> 01:51:53.526
I might believe you!

01:51:57.767 --> 01:52:04.816
I dream often these days of my
home, of all I might have been,

01:52:05.103 --> 01:52:06.722
had I not been forced to leave there,

01:52:06.733 --> 01:52:10.250
not had the need to learn
this tongue of yours.

01:52:13.697 --> 01:52:20.833
Your instinct as regards
the tidal patterns,

01:52:21.427 --> 01:52:23.275
your workings were sound.

01:52:23.587 --> 01:52:28.102
Such strong forces colliding,
they will create a vortex.

01:52:28.721 --> 01:52:35.013
But the breakwater, this, erm,
pier, they have built houses.

01:52:35.024 --> 01:52:39.782
The vortex, gives it shape,
drives it into the land.

01:52:42.997 --> 01:52:45.597
- So the pier must be removed.
- That will not help.

01:52:45.598 --> 01:52:48.256
Pier, no pier, the vortex is made.

01:52:48.257 --> 01:52:51.551
This land not to be lived on.

01:52:59.393 --> 01:53:01.813
Mr. Bloom, please,

01:53:03.726 --> 01:53:05.955
did you kill Leon Ratovski?

01:53:06.687 --> 01:53:09.054
Leon Ratovski was my friend.

01:53:09.065 --> 01:53:10.720
And you know he was in Whitechapel?

01:53:10.731 --> 01:53:12.396
I did. He visited me.

01:53:12.397 --> 01:53:15.594
But he did not come to
Whitechapel to visit me.

01:53:15.605 --> 01:53:17.563
- Then why?
- To see another.

01:53:17.574 --> 01:53:20.276
- He said, to right a wrong.
- A wrong?

01:53:20.277 --> 01:53:22.776
- What kind?
- An abandonment, he said.

01:53:22.777 --> 01:53:24.687
- A child.
- Which?

01:53:25.085 --> 01:53:26.622
I promised not to say.

01:53:27.197 --> 01:53:30.482
And I would not ask my
friend to break an oath.

01:53:30.493 --> 01:53:32.018
And he left you then, yes?

01:53:32.207 --> 01:53:33.571
Mr. Reid,

01:53:34.818 --> 01:53:38.828
I could no more kill Leon Ratovski

01:53:39.511 --> 01:53:41.521
than I could kill myself.

01:53:49.345 --> 01:53:53.155
Oh, Mr. Drake, kind of
you to save me the trouble.

01:53:53.331 --> 01:53:55.715
You may take your prisoner back yourself.

01:53:56.092 --> 01:53:58.925
Mr. Hafeez, sir, I am sorry.

01:54:01.067 --> 01:54:02.546
I am sorry.

01:54:02.547 --> 01:54:07.127
Yes, it is a sadness to cause
such suffering without reward.

01:54:08.737 --> 01:54:10.290
He told you nothing, then?

01:54:10.301 --> 01:54:11.512
No, no.

01:54:11.817 --> 01:54:13.665
Too much, in fact.

01:54:14.007 --> 01:54:17.703
Anything I asked him,
he screamed confirmation.

01:54:18.937 --> 01:54:21.046
Too eager to please, you see.

01:54:21.197 --> 01:54:24.455
And I never trust the word of
a man who's too eager to please.

01:54:25.559 --> 01:54:28.916
Nah, no monster, he.

01:54:31.374 --> 01:54:32.878
Your prisoner, Inspector.

01:54:36.617 --> 01:54:37.817
Come, sir.

01:55:22.067 --> 01:55:23.432
Inspector.

01:55:23.923 --> 01:55:25.123
What?

01:55:25.817 --> 01:55:27.435
I didn't know what to do with him, sir.

01:55:27.446 --> 01:55:29.353
He waits in your office, therefore.

01:55:30.137 --> 01:55:31.337
Who does?

01:55:32.995 --> 01:55:34.195
Go and see.

01:55:46.989 --> 01:55:48.226
Hello, Bennet.

01:55:52.008 --> 01:55:56.108
And this you've done on nothing
but the suspicion of one woman?

01:55:57.262 --> 01:56:00.616
A woman who... forgive me, Mr. Reid.

01:56:00.627 --> 01:56:03.109
I currently lack for
energy and therefore tact,

01:56:03.120 --> 01:56:06.240
but this is a woman for whom
you shamed your wife, is it not?

01:56:07.967 --> 01:56:09.380
I did warn you.

01:56:10.357 --> 01:56:11.557
What?

01:56:11.568 --> 01:56:12.808
You knew?

01:56:13.537 --> 01:56:17.278
You knew he was here, pushing his refined
nose into work he had long since abandoned?

01:56:17.289 --> 01:56:18.864
Now, Drake, I merely told him...

01:56:18.875 --> 01:56:21.096
Do not now me nothing, Jackson!

01:56:21.097 --> 01:56:24.143
I do not know why I should
feel the slightest taken aback.

01:56:24.427 --> 01:56:27.517
The pair of you always were
like two rats in a sack!

01:56:27.977 --> 01:56:29.177
What did he tell you?

01:56:29.188 --> 01:56:30.945
He told me nothing, Bennet.

01:56:31.227 --> 01:56:32.551
He made heavy point of it.

01:56:32.562 --> 01:56:34.201
Did he tell you how we made the case?

01:56:34.212 --> 01:56:35.487
No. As I am trying to say,

01:56:35.498 --> 01:56:37.026
- I know nothing.
- Did he tell you about the clothes

01:56:37.037 --> 01:56:38.740
we found in Bloom's apartment?

01:56:38.987 --> 01:56:41.693
Your genius here took fingerprints

01:56:41.704 --> 01:56:43.749
from the white breast placket of his shirt.

01:56:44.967 --> 01:56:47.106
Quite so, Mr. Reid, fingerprints.

01:56:47.107 --> 01:56:50.181
But accredited this
time, given as evidence.

01:56:50.371 --> 01:56:53.343
The victim, Rabbi Ratovski's
bloody fingerprints

01:56:53.354 --> 01:56:55.682
stuck on a shirt of Isaac Bloom.

01:56:57.067 --> 01:57:00.713
And not one word of denial
did he make, Mr. Reid.

01:57:00.724 --> 01:57:02.065
He did so to me.

01:57:03.537 --> 01:57:05.933
Did you know, Bennet,
that Ratovski and Bloom

01:57:05.944 --> 01:57:08.977
were friends, students of
mathematics together in Paris?

01:57:11.167 --> 01:57:14.635
Mr. Reid, I do not think you
may call me Bennet no longer.

01:57:14.646 --> 01:57:18.894
And I care not whether they were students
of mathematics or cat shit together!

01:57:28.501 --> 01:57:30.581
Sergeant Drummond, you will
meet us in the dead room.

01:57:30.592 --> 01:57:32.414
- Yes, sir.
- And you will bring the Ratovski

01:57:32.425 --> 01:57:33.684
file with you.

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:38.997
Follow me, if you will, Mr. Reid.

01:57:52.007 --> 01:57:53.207
Give it to him.

01:57:56.658 --> 01:57:58.403
Thank you, Sergeant. Leave us.

01:58:02.936 --> 01:58:04.266
Is he still there?

01:58:04.277 --> 01:58:06.031
It was up to you to move him.

01:58:07.365 --> 01:58:09.628
Have a good butcher's at this, Mr. Reid.

01:58:15.267 --> 01:58:17.069
What's this compressor technology?

01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:20.834
Ah, it's a, ah, evaporative cycle...
ammonia, carbon dioxide, and ether.

01:58:20.845 --> 01:58:22.301
Listen to me, the both of you!

01:58:22.312 --> 01:58:25.436
I do not give two silent sods
about the technology of it.

01:58:25.437 --> 01:58:28.831
This, Mr. Reid, you should save
your shock and awe for this.

01:58:34.007 --> 01:58:37.148
Now, we did not release
such knowledge to the press,

01:58:37.159 --> 01:58:38.806
but you ask him what they are.

01:58:39.007 --> 01:58:40.601
What are they, Captain?

01:58:41.226 --> 01:58:45.237
Those are bite marks, Reid...
flesh torn out with teeth.

01:58:51.207 --> 01:58:54.154
The case file, clause 15... read it.

01:58:59.011 --> 01:59:02.622
Found beneath suspect's cot,
one morsel of human flesh.

01:59:03.127 --> 01:59:05.530
Weight 1 and a Â½ pounds as
confirmed by Captain Jackson.

01:59:05.541 --> 01:59:08.632
Characteristics consistent with
that removed from victim's thorax.

01:59:10.427 --> 01:59:11.647
He will hang.

01:59:12.828 --> 01:59:14.028
He will.

01:59:17.467 --> 01:59:19.545
He won't be a lone heathen.

01:59:20.999 --> 01:59:22.921
You will visit her at last, then?

01:59:25.372 --> 01:59:28.874
Yeah, last day on Earth, I believe I will.

02:01:45.757 --> 02:01:48.773
Please, please, Connor, it's for the best.

02:01:49.247 --> 02:01:51.881
A song, Rose, he likes a song.

02:01:52.104 --> 02:01:55.307
A pinch of cinnamon and
brown sugar and hot milk.

02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:57.299
Take him.

02:02:10.147 --> 02:02:14.054
Come, Miss S. You must ready yourself.

02:03:08.081 --> 02:03:10.798
The three of you in harness once again.

02:03:14.817 --> 02:03:17.145
I'm glad you shan't be lonely.

02:04:21.549 --> 02:04:25.089
_

02:06:01.060 --> 02:06:04.264
Mathilda, Mathilda, are you coming?

02:06:09.112 --> 02:06:10.890
_

02:06:35.730 --> 02:06:37.378
Wrong corpse, Captain.

02:06:48.676 --> 02:06:51.542
Ah, Christ, Matthew, you might
at least remove this contraption

02:06:51.553 --> 02:06:52.950
before you have at me.

02:07:08.974 --> 02:07:11.842
Don't ever die for real. Understand?

02:07:32.305 --> 02:07:33.603
Right this way.

02:07:44.516 --> 02:07:48.296
Lovely. It is a rare pleasure
to have someone so pretty

02:07:48.297 --> 02:07:50.757
bunkered down here amongst us.

02:07:51.045 --> 02:07:52.245
Please.

02:08:00.395 --> 02:08:01.595
There.

02:08:02.616 --> 02:08:06.016
Ah, do not fear. We will keep you safe,

02:08:07.789 --> 02:08:10.303
until your affairs are all in order.

02:08:16.147 --> 02:08:17.347
Oh, I...

02:08:17.850 --> 02:08:21.950
See? I have fitted a bolt for your door.

02:09:00.133 --> 02:09:01.551
It is true then.

02:09:02.907 --> 02:09:04.239
It is.

02:09:05.327 --> 02:09:07.179
I hope you are not angered.

02:09:07.707 --> 02:09:10.143
Why would I feel anger, Mr. Reid?

02:09:10.602 --> 02:09:12.244
My friend is home.

02:09:16.586 --> 02:09:18.160
What will you do for work?

02:09:20.459 --> 02:09:22.391
I haven't given it too much thought.

02:09:22.468 --> 02:09:23.668
Oh.

02:09:25.807 --> 02:09:28.278
It would not be so hard, I
think, to have a warrant card

02:09:28.289 --> 02:09:30.727
made for you, should you wish it.

02:09:32.712 --> 02:09:35.170
Needs must, you would
work under me, however.

02:09:37.461 --> 02:09:40.733
And the man, Bloom, that matter is shut.

02:09:43.341 --> 02:09:47.918
The men cannot see me
challenged, nor will I be.

02:09:54.237 --> 02:09:58.754
So, Mr. Reid, what is your wish?
