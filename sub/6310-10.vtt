I never got to see Mick
Jones in the 53rd minute

00:17.494 --> 00:20.017

Clarke, the "Sniffer,"

Sixth of May, 1972.

Oh, yes, sir.

The hell are you talking about?

02:48.343 --> 02:51.957
You were born on April 18, 1963,

02:51.959 --> 02:53.922
in Rzhev, outside Moscow.

02:54.064 --> 02:57.629
Your father's name was

our double agent, Terrence Graves,

made sure you were recruited
by an unwitting MI6.

03:13.480 --> 03:17.482

British sent you to Berlin

03:17.534 --> 03:19.317
to steal Stasi files.

Instead, you turned everything

03:59.516 --> 04:00.914
Didn't you come by Tube?

04:03.530 --> 04:04.939
Course I did.

call a senior moment.

how are Ilyana and Kate?

04:19.036 --> 04:20.214
I don't know.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.656
Haven't been home yet.

04:21.692 --> 04:24.012
I'm staying at the Hilton at Heathrow.

04:24.435 --> 04:25.976
These long ops.

Being away, I, uh...

04:31.822 --> 04:33.386
can't face going home.

04:34.081 --> 04:36.149
You know, being Dmitry.

04:38.096 --> 04:39.564
Three years living a lie.

04:39.566 --> 04:41.093
I'm sick of it.

04:43.355 --> 04:45.384
I want to tell her the truth, Terrence.

04:46.359 --> 04:47.875
What truth?

04:48.459 --> 04:51.126
What truth could you possibly
tell that would help her

04:51.161 --> 04:53.578
to understand who you
are and undo the fact

04:53.580 --> 04:56.103
that you've been lying to
her for the last three years?

04:57.549 --> 04:59.077
Go home.

05:07.511 --> 05:09.478
Papa!

05:09.513 --> 05:11.596
Hey!

05:11.598 --> 05:14.266

05:14.268 --> 05:17.319
Ah.

05:22.763 --> 05:25.022
_

05:25.057 --> 05:27.445
There will be a small ceremony first.

05:27.447 --> 05:29.281
You will sign legal document.

05:29.283 --> 05:32.701
Then there will be a big party.

05:32.753 --> 05:34.369
After the party,

05:34.421 --> 05:38.540
you and the president
will retire upstairs.

05:39.205 --> 05:40.689
Are you a virgin?

05:42.659 --> 05:44.529
That's none of your business.

05:45.767 --> 05:46.985
You're right.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.300
That is between you and God.

05:48.352 --> 05:52.971
But before the president told
you he wished to marry you,

05:52.973 --> 05:55.140
he asked me if you were pure.

05:55.142 --> 05:58.226
I told him what he wanted to hear.

06:02.803 --> 06:04.482
Well, what if I'm not?

06:16.088 --> 06:17.662
After he's...

06:18.291 --> 06:21.499
finished, prick your thumb

06:21.552 --> 06:23.831
and stain the sheet with your blood.

06:33.696 --> 06:35.347
Malika told you I'm a virgin.

06:35.399 --> 06:36.681
It's not true.

06:36.683 --> 06:39.351
When I was 16, in London,

06:39.403 --> 06:42.604
before I found my
faith, I had a boyfriend.

06:42.656 --> 06:45.607
And we had sex. A lot.

06:45.659 --> 06:49.077
And that boy who martyred
himself in Paris, Ifti,

06:49.112 --> 06:51.079
the night before he died,
he wanted to get married,

06:51.114 --> 06:54.082
but there wasn't time. So we had sex.

06:54.473 --> 06:56.245
Several times.

07:00.263 --> 07:03.653
Thank you for... informing me of this.

07:09.561 --> 07:11.549
She's unclean.

07:11.551 --> 07:12.801
I think she's lying.

07:12.836 --> 07:15.703
No, I think you lied to me.

07:17.879 --> 07:21.856
I know your husband
tried to have me killed.

07:22.705 --> 07:23.780
That's not true.

07:23.781 --> 07:27.910
The only reason I kept you
alive is to make the girl behave.

07:28.509 --> 07:29.737
Now

07:30.442 --> 07:32.233
you are no use to me.

07:37.544 --> 07:42.130
She's confused. She doesn't
understand what you're offering her.

07:42.165 --> 07:45.583
To be your wife is a great honor.

07:45.881 --> 07:47.704
So she made up a story.

07:53.293 --> 07:54.592
Well...

07:56.347 --> 07:58.473
there's one way to find out.

08:01.047 --> 08:02.434
Kate,

08:02.436 --> 08:05.320
this man is a doctor...
He's here to examine you.

08:05.795 --> 08:09.391
Please remove your undergarments
and lie down on the bed.

08:18.608 --> 08:20.496
_

08:20.510 --> 08:21.897
Not now!

08:23.246 --> 08:24.377
Sorry to bother you, Hugh.

08:24.544 --> 08:26.749
What the bloody hell do you
want, Terrence? Can't it wait?

08:26.783 --> 08:28.400
Uh...

08:34.393 --> 08:37.993
A KGB major walked into our
embassy in Ankara a few hours ago.

08:38.448 --> 08:40.179
He wants to defect.

08:40.645 --> 08:44.537
Word is he's gonna name
a high-level mole in Six.

08:45.919 --> 08:47.921
I assume they'll want
you for the interrogation.

08:48.050 --> 08:50.588
Well, best go get sorted then, hadn't I?

08:50.985 --> 08:52.390
Sorry, darling.

08:55.178 --> 08:57.762
Fancy a spin? She's fully paid up.

08:58.726 --> 09:00.130
Oh, I, um...

09:00.907 --> 09:02.349
I'd love to, but, uh...

09:02.384 --> 09:04.281
What? Not your type?

09:06.048 --> 09:08.277
I'm not sure now's quite
the right time, sir.

09:09.801 --> 09:11.242
Suit yourself.

09:15.813 --> 09:17.949
I'm blown.

09:18.001 --> 09:20.892
Your joe in Ankara is going to name me.

09:21.064 --> 09:23.788
And what do you want me to do about it?

09:23.840 --> 09:25.315
I want to defect.

09:26.368 --> 09:28.123
There is no turning back.

09:28.290 --> 09:29.972
There never was.

09:30.685 --> 09:32.407
It might take some time

09:32.527 --> 09:35.201
before we can bring over
your wife and your children.

09:35.418 --> 09:37.030
Six months, at least.

09:37.162 --> 09:38.547
Don't care about them.

09:38.577 --> 09:40.050
I want a clean break.

09:42.525 --> 09:45.359
A fresh start.

09:47.019 --> 09:51.379
_

09:54.681 --> 09:57.191
We will help you get
Kate out of Chechnya.

09:57.350 --> 10:01.361
We have assets at the airport
and inside Arsanov's compound.

10:01.628 --> 10:03.355
Surveillance as well.

10:05.177 --> 10:08.847
But... you must do
something for us in return.

10:11.888 --> 10:14.088
You and your friends

10:14.090 --> 10:17.349
at CIA and MI6 ruined
our plan to kill Arsanov

10:17.525 --> 10:19.289
and blame it on the Chechens.

10:20.063 --> 10:23.848
So now you must kill him for us.

10:25.268 --> 10:28.491
Your history as an MI6 agent is perfect.

10:28.650 --> 10:30.359
They always wanted him dead.

10:31.074 --> 10:34.338
And we need a patsy to
blame publicly for the crime.

10:35.207 --> 10:36.898
You will go to prison.

10:37.864 --> 10:40.281
So,

10:40.283 --> 10:41.949
Alexei,

10:42.197 --> 10:45.249
are you willing to trade
your freedom for hers?

10:47.641 --> 10:49.119
You can't trust the Russians.

10:49.254 --> 10:51.919
They have assets to help
me get in, but you're right.

10:52.071 --> 10:54.525
What I don't trust them
to do is to get Kate out.

10:54.797 --> 10:56.453
What makes you think we can help?

10:56.909 --> 10:58.807
You have choppers, I need one.

10:59.002 --> 11:01.302
You fly Kate to London. Once she's back,

11:01.304 --> 11:03.688
you clear up her legal
situation with the French.

11:03.723 --> 11:05.123
You're joking, right?

11:05.300 --> 11:06.957
What makes you think
we'll do any of that?

11:07.132 --> 11:08.468
Because you owe it to her.

11:09.395 --> 11:11.646
She's no terrorist, we all know that.

11:11.648 --> 11:13.798
She's served her country.
She's done her bid.

11:13.816 --> 11:15.961
And if that's not enough to
make you to do the right thing,

11:16.016 --> 11:18.152
don't think I won't go to the press,

11:18.154 --> 11:21.342
tell them how you used and burned
an innocent 18-year-old girl.

11:24.303 --> 11:26.994
I'll make a call.

11:29.832 --> 11:32.500
NINA: What about your legal situation?

11:32.502 --> 11:33.884
What about it?

11:33.920 --> 11:36.671
I can make some calls to
the Justice Department,

11:36.673 --> 11:38.673
FBI in DC.

11:38.675 --> 11:40.341
They love me at the Bureau.

11:41.811 --> 11:45.346
I appreciate you
trying to help me, Nina.

11:45.398 --> 11:49.266
But right now, this is about Kate.

11:49.596 --> 11:52.272

thing some other time.

13:11.734 --> 13:13.267
How's the conference?

13:13.319 --> 13:15.102

13:15.154 --> 13:16.487
Then more talk.

13:16.522 --> 13:20.470
Then we take a break to eat buffet
meals and talk even more... It's awful.

13:22.245 --> 13:24.111
So...

13:24.113 --> 13:26.113
how are you?

13:27.617 --> 13:30.785
The year after I got back, I, uh...

13:30.787 --> 13:33.337
mm, applied to go back in the field.

13:33.559 --> 13:36.634
They made me retake the
field test, which... I passed.

13:36.793 --> 13:37.990
That's wonderful.

13:37.991 --> 13:41.128
But they kept me at the same desk job.

13:41.180 --> 13:44.014
The next year, I took the
test again... I aced it.

13:44.050 --> 13:47.685
They, uh, stuck me at
a different desk job.

13:48.002 --> 13:49.887
They're never gonna let
me back in the field,

13:49.939 --> 13:52.022
but... I'd rather annoy
them and keep reapplying

13:52.058 --> 13:53.858
than have them think I gave up.

13:54.694 --> 13:56.394
Screw them, Curtis.

14:03.025 --> 14:04.698
So, how about you?

38:13.668 --> 38:15.751
You're crazy, you know that?

38:15.753 --> 38:17.753
Yeah.

38:17.755 --> 38:19.120
Crazy in love with you.

38:19.280 --> 38:22.308
Ever since you called
me Agent "Ballhard."

38:34.822 --> 38:37.406
Curtis.

38:39.118 --> 38:40.994
I love you, too.

38:42.516 --> 38:45.392
You don't know what it means
to me to hear you say that.

38:47.869 --> 38:52.204
But I can't take my child
away from his father.

38:55.643 --> 38:57.480
Krystof...

39:00.632 --> 39:02.508
he's a good man.

39:07.976 --> 39:09.568
_

39:12.560 --> 39:13.766
Krystof...

39:14.196 --> 39:16.292
_

39:17.098 --> 39:18.350
Krystof Petr Blazek...

39:18.521 --> 39:20.647
_

39:20.704 --> 39:23.379
_

39:31.137 --> 39:33.304
_

39:35.413 --> 39:39.384
_

39:59.156 --> 40:01.440
♪

40:02.152 --> 40:03.888
I'm sorry, Curtis.

40:04.295 --> 40:05.869
I couldn't get Dmitry.

40:08.916 --> 40:11.184
But I got another bad guy for you.

40:13.921 --> 40:16.922
So you can rest now.

40:24.120 --> 40:25.853
_

40:32.473 --> 40:35.724
Hi, Mama.

40:43.407 --> 40:44.688
_

40:44.723 --> 40:47.736
The full order of battle for MI6.

40:47.738 --> 40:49.447
This will be very useful.

40:49.907 --> 40:51.490
I would imagine so.

40:51.542 --> 40:52.605
What about vulnerabilities?

40:52.745 --> 40:55.702
Anyone in particular we should
be targeting for recruitment?

40:55.947 --> 40:59.659
Very promising junior
officer, uh, Terrence Graves.

41:00.284 --> 41:01.806
He's a poof.

41:02.487 --> 41:03.974
Homosexual.

41:07.796 --> 41:09.758
Listen,

41:09.760 --> 41:13.929
you can keep conducting
swallow operations

41:13.981 --> 41:17.182
and honeypots, threatening,
blackmailing the enemy,

41:17.234 --> 41:18.934
but...

41:18.986 --> 41:21.465
what if there were another way entirely?

41:22.769 --> 41:26.775
What if we take one of yours

41:26.777 --> 41:29.278
and raise him

41:29.280 --> 41:31.672
like he were one of theirs?

41:32.283 --> 41:33.730
If we've done our job well,

41:33.896 --> 41:36.285
we'll have created the
perfect double agent.

41:36.287 --> 41:39.111
He'll talk like one of
them, walk like one of them,

41:39.271 --> 41:41.105
and they'll accept him as
one of their own because,

41:41.158 --> 41:44.510
but for the accident of his
Russian birth, he is now,

41:44.545 --> 41:47.179
for all intents and purposes,

41:47.432 --> 41:48.859
one of them.

41:50.032 --> 41:52.990
Of course, you'd need
someone who could school

41:53.171 --> 41:57.085
fine young Russian patriots in the
subtleties of an English upbringing.

41:57.257 --> 42:01.310
But... now...

42:01.362 --> 42:03.729
you've got me,

42:03.781 --> 42:05.731
haven't you?

42:06.436 --> 42:07.639
At my school,

42:07.820 --> 42:11.401
Alexei will receive the finest
education the Soviet state can provide.

42:16.961 --> 42:19.368
He'd be trained for a
life working overseas.

42:19.497 --> 42:22.090
Be a great Russian patriot, a hero.

42:29.590 --> 42:32.508
Uh, you'll no longer
have contact with him.

42:34.562 --> 42:36.595
But...

42:36.719 --> 42:38.597
for your sacrifice,

42:38.649 --> 42:41.183
you and your family will
be well taken care of.

43:00.037 --> 43:02.170
Welcome to your new home, boy.

43:03.015 --> 43:04.360
From now on,

43:04.521 --> 43:07.207
you will be called Alex Reed.

43:09.779 --> 43:13.921
_

43:24.862 --> 43:27.031
Good morning, Alexei.

43:28.032 --> 43:31.817
I thought you would like to see this.

43:36.559 --> 43:39.448
You neglected to tell us
that your young Ms. Crawford

43:39.606 --> 43:40.920
did your dirty work for you.

43:41.094 --> 43:42.914
He was trying to rape her.

43:43.214 --> 43:44.596
She had no choice.

43:45.181 --> 43:47.268
We won't be pressing
charges against her,

43:47.432 --> 43:49.399
nor will we reveal her identity.

43:49.552 --> 43:52.939
We will, however, be releasing
the video to the press

43:53.106 --> 43:54.397
with her face blurred.

43:55.009 --> 43:56.278
The story, true enough,

43:56.432 --> 44:00.740
will be that a young woman forced
into an illegal polygamous marriage

44:00.850 --> 44:04.266
by the morally corrupt
President of Chechnya

44:04.268 --> 44:06.474
killed him in self-defense.

44:11.211 --> 44:14.953
We no longer need to blame
Arsanov's assassination on you.

44:18.916 --> 44:20.549
So I'm free to go.

44:22.198 --> 44:23.919
Of course.

44:25.556 --> 44:28.593
As long as you agree to
go back to work for us.

44:30.429 --> 44:33.377
_

44:34.119 --> 44:36.305
_

44:37.052 --> 44:38.563

44:41.052 --> 44:43.440

44:46.620 --> 44:48.892
