WEBVTT

00:09.226 --> 00:10.053
Adam!

00:10.097 --> 00:12.055
-
- Stop it!

00:12.099 --> 00:15.493
Aw. If only he had a dollar
for every time he's heard that.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.756
You know, every time
I see the two of together,

00:17.800 --> 00:19.758
I re-realize that
it wasn't a dream

00:19.802 --> 00:21.238
when I walked in
on you two pawing each other

00:21.282 --> 00:23.327
- six months ago.
- Wait. Six months?

00:23.371 --> 00:25.764
Oh, we should have
a celebratory anniversary picnic

00:25.808 --> 00:28.158
- and hike together.
- Aw. That sounds great, but I can't.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.899
We have an obstetrician
appointment this morning.

00:29.942 --> 00:33.076
Yeah, we sure do, and Liam's got
a full day, which means

00:33.120 --> 00:36.253
it's just me and Stacey
and no one else.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.907
I'll take a rain check
on the date, though.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.343
My lower back's been killing
me, so it's probably best

00:39.387 --> 00:40.518
I stickto flat land anyway.
Oh, no.

00:40.562 --> 00:41.824
I'll give you a massage later.

00:41.867 --> 00:43.391
Thank you.
We had a deal.
You weren't

00:43.434 --> 00:44.827
gonna talk
about this stuff in front of me.

00:44.870 --> 00:46.263
I never agreed to that deal.

00:46.307 --> 00:47.221
- Uh-huh.
- We'll see you when we get back.

00:47.264 --> 00:48.787
I'll be here.

00:48.831 --> 00:50.050
Oh, we know.

00:50.093 --> 00:52.095
<i>It's the best thing</i>

00:52.139 --> 00:55.751
I've read in...
I don't even know how long.

00:55.794 --> 00:57.448
You know you're not
my student anymore, right?

00:57.492 --> 01:00.016
There's no need to suck up
to me for a better grade, Liam.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.974
Look, if this isn't a best
seller, I don't know what is.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.107
It's really five years old?

01:04.151 --> 01:05.326
Why haven't you ever
published it?

01:05.369 --> 01:06.849
I never thought
it was ready,

01:06.892 --> 01:08.633
which is why you're the first
to read it.

01:08.677 --> 01:10.374
I'm a little superstitious.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.028
I don't show drafts
to many people.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.030
Look, I get it.
No one's read mine either.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.640
And no one will
until I can come up

01:15.684 --> 01:17.425
with a killer ending
like yours.
I'm here

01:17.468 --> 01:19.253
when you're ready to show me.
After all,

01:19.296 --> 01:21.037
I'm supposed to be mentoring
you, not the other way around.

01:22.212 --> 01:24.171
It's due any
minute, right?

01:24.214 --> 01:25.737
Yeah. Yeah.
Don't remind me.

01:25.781 --> 01:28.653
I've just had so many
distractions lately.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.613
I mean, my press junket today
and my movie premiere tomorrow.

01:31.656 --> 01:34.137
I mean, look,
I-I am thrilled, obviously.

01:34.181 --> 01:37.619
It's just... I don't know,
finding time isn't easy.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.360
That's why,
whenever I have a deadline,

01:39.403 --> 01:42.363
I drop off the grid and
head out to a secret hideaway.

01:42.406 --> 01:44.800
Really? That's a great idea.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.889
- Where do you go?
- I said <i>secret</i> hideaway.

01:46.932 --> 01:47.977
You're gonna have
to find your own.

01:49.326 --> 01:51.763
Did a spa throw up in here?

01:51.807 --> 01:53.417
Oh. This is what I call

01:53.461 --> 01:55.985
the Adam Carrington
prenatal wellness experience.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.466
Thank you.
I'm gonna walk Stacey through

01:58.509 --> 02:01.991
some light stretches
in a soothing environment.

02:02.034 --> 02:04.515
Sciatica pain is a real concern
for pregnant women.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.126
You're a real concern to me.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.953
I'm an in-house physician
that can be really helpful

02:07.997 --> 02:10.869
to you and my girlfriend
in this last stage of pregnancy,

02:10.913 --> 02:12.132
so you should be grateful.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.916
Grateful? Okay.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.309
All right, that's it.
Everybody out!

02:15.352 --> 02:18.094
Thank you. Off you go.

02:18.138 --> 02:21.750
Look, I have put up
with your relationship

02:21.793 --> 02:24.231
with our surrogate because
I don't want to upset Stacey.

02:24.274 --> 02:25.928
But once she gives birth,

02:25.971 --> 02:27.712
your charm will wear off
quicker than the epidural.

02:27.756 --> 02:29.366
Well, we'll see about that,
but I think

02:29.410 --> 02:31.412
you're being shortsighted
about this whole situation.

02:31.455 --> 02:32.804
Do you know how many people

02:32.848 --> 02:35.242
would kill
to have an on-call doctor?

02:35.285 --> 02:37.244
One that was chief of staff
of a major hospital?

02:37.287 --> 02:38.332
Yeah, exactly.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.855
- Was.
- That was due

02:39.898 --> 02:41.552
to Amanda's vindictiveness,

02:41.596 --> 02:43.119
not my performance.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.556
And while we're on the subject,
I was wondering,

02:45.600 --> 02:47.167
is there any possibility

02:47.210 --> 02:49.212
that you might
help me get reinstated?

02:49.256 --> 02:50.561
I want to ensure

02:50.605 --> 02:52.737
that Stacey has the care
she needs,

02:52.781 --> 02:55.000
and I can only do that
if I go back to work.

02:55.697 --> 02:57.089
Are you kidding?

02:57.133 --> 02:58.917
At this point, you're just
a glorified vet.

02:58.961 --> 03:02.747
And I wouldn't even trust you
with Bo, so... no.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.103
I still can't believe

03:11.147 --> 03:13.758
we have a full afternoon
of interviews.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.892
This is more publicity than I've
had for any film I've ever done.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.850
Well, being married
to a Carrington comes

03:18.894 --> 03:20.461
with a spotlight,
so we might as well use it.

03:20.504 --> 03:22.680
Plus, you're a pretty big name
these days.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.552
Though not as big
as our star

03:24.595 --> 03:26.118
Janelle Crowley.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.990
Thanks. And sorry no one knows
your name at all.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.557
Don't take it personally.
You'll get there, or not.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.993
Okay, I've got
to hit a deadline

03:31.036 --> 03:32.864
for my publisher,
so I won't be around

03:32.908 --> 03:34.562
to keep the peace,
so at the junket

03:34.605 --> 03:36.825
can you stick to talking
strictly about the movie?

03:36.868 --> 03:39.001
All right? Not how much
you two annoy each other?

03:39.044 --> 03:40.481
I know one of us will be
completely professional.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.091
Which would have to be me,
since I'm still not sure

03:42.134 --> 03:44.398
what your profession is,
unless it's judgmental,

03:44.441 --> 03:46.095
self-absorbed multimillionaire.

03:46.138 --> 03:47.357
I'll take that
over humorless, finger-licking

03:47.401 --> 03:48.576
"artist."

03:48.619 --> 03:50.273
And, yes, those
were air quotes.

03:50.317 --> 03:51.709
Yeah, see, this is the stuff
I'm talking about, guys.

03:51.753 --> 03:54.321
Can we please not give
the press any fodder?

03:54.364 --> 03:56.410
No fodder.
Got it.

03:56.453 --> 03:57.933
Thank you.

03:59.543 --> 04:00.979
I know she gets under your skin,

04:01.023 --> 04:02.633
but don't let her provoke you,
all right?

04:02.677 --> 04:04.505
I promise if you can just
get through these next two days,

04:04.548 --> 04:06.158
you'll never have
to see her again.

04:06.202 --> 04:09.118
It can't happen soon enough.

04:09.161 --> 04:10.685
<i>Game's over, Blake.</i>

04:10.728 --> 04:13.122
- You got me.
- I told them to let you in

04:13.165 --> 04:14.515
because I was
feeling generous,

04:14.558 --> 04:15.646
but I'm not in the mood
for mysteries.

04:15.690 --> 04:16.952
Let me enlighten you.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.780
For the past six months,
I've been buying back

04:18.823 --> 04:20.477
Colby Co. assets,
everything except

04:20.521 --> 04:22.523
the music and robotics division because,

04:22.566 --> 04:24.264
well, I couldn't find them.

04:24.307 --> 04:25.830
Until today

04:25.874 --> 04:29.094
when I discovered
that you own them.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.140
Well, that explains
why you're here.

04:31.183 --> 04:32.533
Your accountants
must have screwed up

04:32.576 --> 04:33.577
when they filed
the annual report

04:33.621 --> 04:36.188
for your shell company.

04:36.232 --> 04:38.103
Or you leaked it
just to provoke me.

04:38.147 --> 04:39.496
No, I did notdo that.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.150
Remind me.
I will have them all fired.

04:41.193 --> 04:43.587
But your asset liquidation
last year was just

04:43.631 --> 04:45.023
too good to pass up,

04:45.067 --> 04:47.504
so I sold some overseas
real estate to pay for them.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.245
And they've continued
to be profitable, so,

04:49.289 --> 04:51.726
seems like a pretty smart move,
if I do say so myself.

04:51.769 --> 04:55.817
I'll pay you ten percent above
market value to get them back.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.340
I'm not interested in selling.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.124
All that IP was created

04:59.168 --> 05:01.126
when you worked
for Carrington Atlantic anyway.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.086
So these companies are back
with their rightful owner-- me.

05:04.129 --> 05:06.523
You know, I told myself I'd
never go to war with you again

05:06.567 --> 05:08.438
because I didn't want
to sink to your level.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.353
But this is personal.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.833
So I hope
you're ready to suffer.

05:12.877 --> 05:14.792
Do I look worried?
Because I am not worried.

05:14.836 --> 05:17.795
Well, you should be.

05:17.839 --> 05:20.058
Well, I'm not!

05:43.081 --> 05:45.345
Jeff? Did we have a meeting
I forgot about?

05:45.388 --> 05:48.391
Uh, no. No, I just thought
I'd stop by and check in.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.480
See if there was any updates
on who might own

05:50.524 --> 05:52.743
- my Colby Co. assets.
- I hate to be

05:52.787 --> 05:54.005
the bearer of bad news again,

05:54.049 --> 05:55.877
but it-it truly does seem
like a dead end.

05:55.920 --> 05:59.402
I mean, I stopped pursuing it
when, um, the trail went cold.

05:59.446 --> 06:02.971
Right. Unless it's because that
trail led to Carrington Manor?

06:03.014 --> 06:05.365
Look, I know
Blake bought the companies.

06:05.408 --> 06:08.063
Pretty sure you do, too.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.848
Okay, yes, yes,
but in my defense,

06:10.892 --> 06:12.415
I was in a very
difficult position, okay?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.851
Being caught
between you

06:13.895 --> 06:16.201
and my father--
it's not... pleasant.

06:16.245 --> 06:19.204
I mean, can you blame me
for trying to stay out of it?

06:19.248 --> 06:20.902
Maybe not,

06:20.945 --> 06:22.469
but I do know how
- you can make it up to me.
- Anything. Name it.

06:22.512 --> 06:24.253
Convince Blake
to sell me back my companies,

06:24.296 --> 06:25.820
and we'll call it even.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.778
Anything but that.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.519
You know that that's never
gonna happen, okay?

06:29.563 --> 06:31.260
Blake is never gonna...

06:31.303 --> 06:32.435
Paging Amanda Carrington.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.958
Second floor nurses' station.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.657
Sorry. Just excuse me
for one moment.

06:36.700 --> 06:40.835
Yeah, of course.
I'll, uh... I'll wait.

06:53.804 --> 06:56.285
Okay, come on, come on, come on.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.549
That was odd.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.725
- They said they didn't need me.
- Huh.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.032
You heard the page, too, right?
I'm not losing my mind, am I?

07:04.075 --> 07:06.643
Yeah, I totally heard it.
That's really weird.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.645
- Uh, anyways, I need an answer.
- Look,

07:08.689 --> 07:10.386
I just don't think
Blake's gonna go for it.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.040
And this is above
my pay grade, okay?

07:12.083 --> 07:13.868
- There's too much history.
- Exactly.

07:13.911 --> 07:18.263
Look, you haven't been around
for a Colby-Carrington war.

07:18.307 --> 07:21.049
Things can get ugly,
so if there's

07:21.092 --> 07:24.574
anything you can do,
please do it.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.794
On-call nurse to Radiology.

07:26.837 --> 07:28.883
On-call nurse
to Radiology.

07:30.885 --> 07:33.583
Thank you for the tea.
It's perfect.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.498
Mmm.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.544
You're perfect.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.850
Besides, it's the least

07:39.894 --> 07:42.984
I could do
since Fallon shut down the rest

07:43.027 --> 07:44.507
of the wellness experience
I had planned for you.

07:44.551 --> 07:47.031
The tension between you
and Fallon is...

07:47.075 --> 07:49.599
It's a lot.

07:49.643 --> 07:51.514
And I know
our relationship isn't helping,

07:51.558 --> 07:54.952
so I've been thinking, maybe
we should take some time apart.

07:54.996 --> 07:56.476
For your sake.

07:56.519 --> 07:58.173
No. No, absolutely not.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.566
Just until the baby's born.

07:59.609 --> 08:01.829
You just need to ignore Fallon.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.657
She's a first-time mother, and
she's concerned about her baby.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.528
But don't let that affect us.

08:05.572 --> 08:06.964
I mean, she can't even see
how helpful it would be

08:07.008 --> 08:08.836
to have me reinstated
at the hospital.

08:08.879 --> 08:09.793
If we weren't together,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.012
she'd probably see that.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.535
Ooh.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.624
Collecting eights?

08:14.668 --> 08:17.627
Ah, nothing gets past you, huh?

08:17.671 --> 08:20.543
Which is why you know that
taking a break isn't the answer.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.112
Getting Fallon to see
that I'm on her side

08:24.155 --> 08:26.418
is the only thing
that will win her over.

08:26.462 --> 08:27.855
Well, if anyone can
figure out a solution

08:27.898 --> 08:29.334
to win her over, it's you.

08:29.378 --> 08:31.467
Even if you can't figure out
a way to beat me.

08:31.511 --> 08:33.687
Gin.

08:33.730 --> 08:35.602
Oh, wait. We were playing gin?

08:39.040 --> 08:40.607
I miss you already.

08:40.650 --> 08:42.478
Don't forget to text me
when you arrive.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.698
Although I'll know where you are
because I track your phone.

08:44.741 --> 08:47.570
Fallon, I'm going to
La Mirage for one night.

08:47.614 --> 08:49.441
So you don't want me
coming with you, then?

08:49.485 --> 08:52.140
Because I could really use
a night at a hotel.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.229
Well, then
- I'd really get no work done.
- Okay, fine.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.796
You're probably right.
I should stay here.

08:55.839 --> 08:57.841
Especially since
Adam has been playing doctor

08:57.885 --> 08:59.451
with Stacey
in more ways than one.

08:59.495 --> 09:00.844
Oh, God. That's still a thing?

09:00.888 --> 09:02.846
Oh, yeah.
And now he keeps offering

09:02.890 --> 09:04.587
to whip out his stethoscope

09:04.631 --> 09:06.894
and use it.
I don't want him

09:06.937 --> 09:09.070
or his mail-order medical
license anywhere near the baby.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.115
On second thought,
I can totally stay

09:11.159 --> 09:12.464
and stand guard
outside her room.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.466
Hey, stop, okay?
I've got it covered.

09:14.510 --> 09:16.773
You go write, and I'll see you
tomorrow at the premiere.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.559
We can celebrate all
- your amazing success.
- Okay.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.648
Hey! Is that the pen
that I bought you

09:21.691 --> 09:23.650
when you won
the Paysinger Award?

09:23.693 --> 09:26.130
Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna take it
with me for good luck.

09:26.174 --> 09:30.918
All right, well, go off
- and write a best seller.
- Okay.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.054
Our call center's being
overwhelmed by angry customers.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.622
High-paying customers.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.145
If we don't fix this soon...
What's going on?

09:41.189 --> 09:43.147
PPA planes can't take off.

09:43.191 --> 09:45.323
The radio tower's
communication system is down.

09:45.367 --> 09:47.978
Enough with the excuses, all
right? Just get the airplanes

09:48.022 --> 09:50.459
back in the air ASAP!

09:50.502 --> 09:52.983
- This seems like a bad time.
- It is.

09:53.027 --> 09:55.595
So you might as well tell me
what you came to tell me.

09:55.638 --> 09:57.640
Um, look, I just wanted
to warn you

09:57.684 --> 09:59.642
that Jeff is coming
for his Colby Co. divisions.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.078
It's old news.

10:01.122 --> 10:02.427
I saw him this morning.

10:02.471 --> 10:03.907
He's probably
behind all of this.

10:03.951 --> 10:05.387
He somehow hacked
into our mainframe

10:05.430 --> 10:06.867
and shut us down.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.651
Well,

10:08.695 --> 10:10.697
speak of the IT devil.

10:10.740 --> 10:13.656
Colby, you crossed the line
this time.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.702
I don't know what you're
talking about. It's not my fault

10:15.745 --> 10:17.138
if you use
yesterday's technology

10:17.181 --> 10:18.966
for your backwater airport.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.272
I was only calling to see if
you've reconsidered my offer.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.535
Jeff, there's no need
to do it this way, okay?

10:23.579 --> 10:24.580
- We can discuss this.
- There's nothing to discuss.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.408
If your father wants his airport

10:26.451 --> 10:31.631
back up and running, he knows
exactly what to do. Bye now.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.023
Wait.

10:33.067 --> 10:34.242
Jeff made you an offer
for his assets,

10:34.285 --> 10:35.330
and you turned him down?

10:36.374 --> 10:37.419
Is that what this is all about?

10:37.462 --> 10:38.550
What difference does it make?

10:38.594 --> 10:39.943
He's holding PPA hostage,

10:39.987 --> 10:41.379
and there will be
no negotiation,

10:41.423 --> 10:43.077
only retaliation.

10:44.861 --> 10:47.777
My apologies for the room,
but with the press junket

10:47.821 --> 10:50.301
for <i>The Biggest Payday</i> occupying
the Presidential Suite,

10:50.345 --> 10:51.694
this is all we have.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.261
So, it's technically
your fault.

10:53.304 --> 10:54.523
Don't worry, all right?

10:54.566 --> 10:55.611
This is perfect.
I just need a quiet place

10:55.655 --> 10:58.005
to write without distractions.

10:58.048 --> 10:59.876
You mean, without Fallon.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.922
Which, by the way,
she already called

11:01.965 --> 11:03.445
asking for your room number.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.012
I told her you
were in 428.

11:05.055 --> 11:07.101
Yeah, but this isn't...

11:07.841 --> 11:09.581
All right, yeah. Good call.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.062
And I stocked the mini-bar
with all your favorite snacks

11:12.106 --> 11:13.411
and beverages.

11:13.455 --> 11:15.370
- What more could a writer want?
- If you see me out

11:15.413 --> 11:17.415
of this room, force me back in.
My publisher's waiting.

11:17.459 --> 11:20.462
If I don't get this last chapter
done... I'm a dead man.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.768
I won't keep you
any longer, then.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.248
<i>Personally, I think</i>

11:24.292 --> 11:26.816
the world could do with more
romantic movies right about now.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.122
But, I don't know,
call me sappy.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.645
While it's tempting

11:29.689 --> 11:31.647
to take him up on that,
I'd have to agree.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.605
Your <i>Hot Tea Atlanta</i> followers

11:33.649 --> 11:35.651
are absolutely
- gonna love this film.
- Yes, and, Nina,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.740
I heard you're considering
directing a film

11:37.784 --> 11:39.699
in Rio with an old flame,

11:39.742 --> 11:41.222
Rocco Donovan,
as the lead actor.

11:42.397 --> 11:43.572
- Care to comment?
- Uh...

11:43.615 --> 11:45.269
We-we dated back
in film school.

11:45.313 --> 11:47.097
And any chance of a reunion,

11:47.141 --> 11:48.490
if you catch my drift?

11:48.533 --> 11:50.100
Our readers would
love to know.

11:50.144 --> 11:52.276
I'd prefer we just stick
to talking about this film.

11:52.320 --> 11:53.974
Janelle Crowley was normal,

11:54.017 --> 11:56.019
the movie was on budget,
and you're fine

11:56.063 --> 11:57.412
working with your ex.

11:57.455 --> 11:58.892
I need gossip.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.763
So, what about
those leaked photos from set

12:00.807 --> 12:02.330
of Janelle Crowley?

12:02.373 --> 12:04.549
Oh, you mean Mr. Culhane's
girlfriend Sasha Harris?

12:04.593 --> 12:06.029
The one in the movie?

12:06.073 --> 12:08.902
Ex-girlfriend,
and that was a misunderstanding.

12:08.945 --> 12:11.469
Did I mention that I donated
my producing salary

12:11.513 --> 12:13.689
to the organization
Black Women in Cinema?

12:13.733 --> 12:15.038
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, I did.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.693
You didn't ask.
You think I'm self-absorbed?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.434
You two really rub each other
the wrong way, don't you?

12:19.477 --> 12:20.827
- No.
- No. No.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.306
We're totally...
we're totally friends.

12:22.350 --> 12:24.787
- We actually like each other.
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.572
Finally, something interesting.

12:27.616 --> 12:30.097
So, first-time producer hires
his girlfriend

12:30.140 --> 12:31.838
against the wishes
of his director,

12:31.881 --> 12:34.797
and girlfriend leaks pictures
to sabotage

12:34.841 --> 12:36.364
the movie out of jealousy.

12:36.407 --> 12:37.800
No wonder
you two don't like each other.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.107
Ex-girlfriend, okay?

12:40.150 --> 12:41.848
And I think
that concludes this interview.

12:41.891 --> 12:43.806
Thank you very much,
Clara Lucia. We'll see you

12:43.850 --> 12:45.982
- on the red carpet.
- You sure will.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.897
Bye-bye.

12:48.898 --> 12:50.857
Once this gossip gets out,

12:50.900 --> 12:52.597
Liam is going to be
furious with me.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.338
You're overreacting, as usual.

12:54.382 --> 12:56.253
All press is good press.

12:56.297 --> 12:58.212
It's easy for you to say. Didn't
make you look like an idiot.

12:58.255 --> 13:01.389
You'll end up fine,
just like usual.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.913
Sounds like a compliment,
feels like an insult, so...

13:03.957 --> 13:05.654
- Don't be so touchy! Oh.
- Ow!

13:05.697 --> 13:08.613
You just hit me in the face!

13:08.657 --> 13:11.878
Uh, so you're not
going to apologize?

13:11.921 --> 13:13.357
You didn't even
- give me a chance.
- You could have

13:13.401 --> 13:15.316
chipped my tooth
right before the big night!

13:15.359 --> 13:16.578
Stop being such a baby.
I barely grazed you.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.014
I mean, if I wanted,
I could do

13:18.058 --> 13:19.363
some real damage to that body.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.035
Um...

13:39.079 --> 13:41.255
that never
should have happened.

13:41.298 --> 13:44.127
Uh, uh, it was

13:44.171 --> 13:49.480
just two adults
with pent-up stress

13:49.524 --> 13:52.483
that needed an outlet, right?

13:52.527 --> 13:56.096
Right, consenting adults need
to release steam sometimes.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.272
But that will never
happen again.

13:58.315 --> 14:00.056
Never.

14:02.276 --> 14:05.105
- Thanks.
- Plus,

14:05.148 --> 14:07.498
I promised Liam
- that we'd be professional.
- Okay, so,

14:07.542 --> 14:09.196
we'll just avoid each other
until the premiere party's over.

14:09.239 --> 14:12.286
I can do all the red carpet
press, and you can make sure

14:12.329 --> 14:13.765
the party runs smoothly.

14:13.809 --> 14:15.419
Or we could

14:15.463 --> 14:17.421
walk the red carpet
side by side,

14:17.465 --> 14:19.510
with smiles on our faces.
That way the press knows

14:19.554 --> 14:23.079
that we actually
get along just fine.

14:23.123 --> 14:26.387
Professionally.
Who knows? Maybe you can

14:26.430 --> 14:29.042
use a hand on your next film.

14:29.085 --> 14:30.695
So you want to work on my film?

14:30.739 --> 14:31.696
That was just a little joke.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.481
You probably have another ex

14:33.524 --> 14:34.830
that can produce the film

14:34.874 --> 14:36.353
that your other ex
is starring in,

14:36.397 --> 14:38.660
and then you can just be
surrounded by exes.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.881
You know what?
Maybe you're right.

14:43.926 --> 14:47.016
And I can totally play nice
for, for the next 24 hours.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.648
Oh, come on, Ridley. Stay awake.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.452
Ah, forget it. Who's thirsty?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.019
Whiskey. Neat.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.979
What's on your mind, son?

16:21.328 --> 16:23.286
You look troubled.

16:23.330 --> 16:26.202
That obvious, huh?
I'm holed up here

16:26.246 --> 16:28.944
to write a sequel to my book <i>The Biggest Payday.</i>

16:28.988 --> 16:31.468
It was a huge hit.
Maybe you've heard of it.

16:31.512 --> 16:33.470
Don't read anything
but the racing form.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.257
Well, considering I can't get
any words down on the page,

16:37.300 --> 16:39.128
you won't be reading
this one either.

16:39.172 --> 16:42.392
My wife and my publisher think
I'm finishing the final chapter,

16:42.436 --> 16:46.266
but I'm stuck on page... 13.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.618
Which makes me uneasy
'cause I'm superstitious.

16:50.661 --> 16:54.665
We get a lot of superstitious
writers here at the hotel.

16:54.709 --> 16:57.668
Like this guy.
Big-time writer.

16:57.712 --> 17:02.064
Always stays in Room 428.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.545
Apparently, he wrote
two best sellers in that room.

17:04.588 --> 17:07.809
Says he felt
more inspiration there

17:07.852 --> 17:10.159
than anywhere else
in the whole world.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.857
- It's his secret hideaway.
- You know, maybe I could

17:12.901 --> 17:16.165
switch to that room,
channel some of that creativity.

17:16.209 --> 17:19.081
Booked. Full house tonight.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.214
Big event going on.

17:21.257 --> 17:23.216
Well, maybe
they'll switch rooms.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.435
People can be reasonable.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.134
I don't think
that's a good idea, son.

17:28.177 --> 17:30.658
You don't want to copy
what works for another man.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.964
Could be riskier

17:33.008 --> 17:35.576
than you ever dreamed.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.056
What's that supposed to mean?

17:45.760 --> 17:49.155
Hey, what happened...
to the other bartender?

17:49.198 --> 17:51.679
Been just me all night.

17:51.722 --> 17:54.899
Maybe I should
cut you off, huh?

17:55.900 --> 17:57.511
No need.

17:59.817 --> 18:02.385
425, 426.

18:02.429 --> 18:07.738
427. So, four-twenty...

18:07.782 --> 18:09.827
29?

18:11.046 --> 18:13.004
Hey, could you help me out here?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.790
Oh, I don't know.
I've got a lot...

18:15.833 --> 18:19.533
Oh, wow. You're rich
playboy-turned-famous author

18:19.576 --> 18:21.143
Jack Liam Ridley Lowden.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.232
Yup, that's me.

18:23.276 --> 18:26.975
I follow you, you know.
On the social media.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.369
Yeah, I'm a big fan. Yeah.

18:29.412 --> 18:30.848
You got the kind of life

18:30.892 --> 18:32.241
a working stiff
like me would kill for.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.809
Oh. I'm flattered.

18:34.852 --> 18:37.072
Could I exchange
an autograph

18:37.116 --> 18:38.943
for a little help
in finding Room 428?

18:38.987 --> 18:40.945
Oh, yeah.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.164
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

18:42.208 --> 18:43.861
Follow me.

18:43.905 --> 18:46.951
So, uh, why are you so
interested in finding that room?

18:46.995 --> 18:48.779
Well, this is gonna sound funny,

18:48.823 --> 18:49.911
but I'm looking
for a little inspiration

18:49.954 --> 18:51.347
to finish my latest book.

18:51.391 --> 18:53.523
And I heard rumors
about this room being special.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.395
Yeah, I'm sure

18:55.438 --> 18:57.048
you'll get exactly
- what you deserve.
- Good.

18:57.092 --> 18:58.572
Because my publisher
will kill me

18:58.615 --> 19:01.140
if I don't get this
turned in soon.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.880
Hope not actually kill you.

19:02.924 --> 19:05.187
I mean, I suppose
that would make the signature

19:05.231 --> 19:08.364
more valuable, wouldn't it?

19:12.151 --> 19:15.023
Y-You know what? I think
I can find it on my own.

19:15.066 --> 19:17.765
Maybe just point me
in the right direction?

19:17.808 --> 19:19.767
Let me get you
that autograph first.

19:22.596 --> 19:24.554
I can't find my lucky pen.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.165
Hey, wait up!

19:29.603 --> 19:31.126
Oh...

19:34.042 --> 19:36.262
Um...

19:36.305 --> 19:38.829
sorry to interrupt.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.051
I'm guessing
this isn't room 428?

19:51.973 --> 19:54.845
You're that novelist, right?

19:54.889 --> 19:57.892
The one who just had his book
- made into a Hollywood movie?
- You know,

19:57.935 --> 20:00.373
I seem to get recognized
a lot here.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.113
Take a picture with me.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.290
Oh, um...

20:06.292 --> 20:08.468
I really should go.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.252
I-I don't think I was invited.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.646
How about
if I invite you upstairs?

20:12.689 --> 20:14.648
This party is
like death warmed over.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.303
- I'm sorry. I'm married.
- So am I.

20:18.347 --> 20:21.307
Meet me in five minutes,
room 428.

20:22.351 --> 20:25.354
That's your room?
I've been looking for you.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.356
Well, you found me.

20:27.400 --> 20:31.055
And here's a preview
of what's to come.

20:37.801 --> 20:41.936
Oh, I can't wait for you
to show me all your talents.

20:41.979 --> 20:44.025
I bet you're pretty creative.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.941
In more ways than one.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.905
Hey, wait. Hang on.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.609
Hey.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.132
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:08.397 --> 21:11.661
The writer stabbed
that poor woman to death.

21:11.705 --> 21:13.141
The writer stabbed
that poor woman to death.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.185
What?

21:14.229 --> 21:16.231
No!

21:16.275 --> 21:18.929
No, no, no, no. No, it wasn't
me. I did... I didn't do it!

21:25.414 --> 21:27.329
Hey! Hey.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.331
Did you see
someone come through here?

21:29.375 --> 21:31.246
A killer just attacked this poor
woman downstairs right after

21:31.290 --> 21:32.682
she was saying
the nicest things about me.

21:32.726 --> 21:34.467
Okay, well, people die at
hotels all the time.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.033
She was stabbed to death!

21:36.077 --> 21:38.166
All right, she was trying
to help me find room 428.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.124
Well, I still have, like,
three rooms to clean

21:40.168 --> 21:42.126
before my shift's over, so
that's what I'm worried about.

21:42.170 --> 21:44.738
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Do you know the bellhop?

21:44.781 --> 21:46.305
The one with the crazy eyes?
He looks suspicious.

21:46.348 --> 21:49.003
- That guy?
- Yeah.

21:49.046 --> 21:51.005
He wouldn't hurt anyone.
He's a bookworm.

21:51.048 --> 21:53.312
Like, I mean,
he just gave me this book.

21:55.009 --> 21:58.012
Oh, my God, that's you!

21:58.055 --> 21:59.405
I knew you
looked familiar.

21:59.448 --> 22:01.145
Wow. Now I'm impressed.

22:01.189 --> 22:02.712
Yes. Thank you.
That's very kind of you.

22:02.756 --> 22:05.062
- So, what else have you written?
- Nothing... yet!

22:05.106 --> 22:07.369
- That's why I'm here.
- Oh.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.502
Well, now I'm
less impressed.

22:09.545 --> 22:11.939
It's not as easy
as you might think!

22:11.982 --> 22:13.897
Okay, now
you're creeping me out.

22:13.941 --> 22:15.899
Why don't you go back to your
room and do a bit of writing?

22:15.943 --> 22:18.075
No one likes a one-hit wonder.

22:18.119 --> 22:18.946
Yeah, and no one likes

22:18.989 --> 22:20.600
a sassy housekeeper either.

22:21.601 --> 22:23.603
I need to find room 428.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.219
And now
he killed the housekeeper.

22:31.262 --> 22:32.525
And now he killed
the housekeeper.

22:32.568 --> 22:33.961
WOMAN 2:
Now he killed the housekeeper.

22:34.004 --> 22:36.180
MAN 2:
Now he killed the housekeeper.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.142
God, no.

22:46.887 --> 22:48.845
Ah, damn it!

23:28.972 --> 23:30.060
God!

23:30.104 --> 23:33.281
Come on. Come on!

23:37.981 --> 23:39.069
Work!

23:50.690 --> 23:52.648
- What are you doing here?
- I came to help

23:52.692 --> 23:55.042
with your writer's block by
bringing you some fresh towels

23:55.085 --> 23:56.304
just in case
you want a hot bath.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.137
My pen.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.366
Who are you?

24:15.410 --> 24:19.109
What do you want?!
I just want to finish my book.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.860
Sorry.

24:30.904 --> 24:33.254
I can't let you do that, Liam.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.951
Yeah, we both know

24:34.995 --> 24:39.521
that you're a hack
who doesn't deserve

24:39.565 --> 24:42.785
any praise
or encouragement.

24:42.829 --> 24:47.790
And your best
writing days are over.

24:47.834 --> 24:50.532
As are all your days.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.753
Whoa, whoa. Easy.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.798
Are you trying to serve
me into next week?

24:55.842 --> 24:57.365
Are you okay?

24:57.408 --> 24:58.932
You look terrible.

24:58.975 --> 25:01.456
Oh, God,
I just had the worst dream.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.546
Other people's dreams
are so boring.

25:04.590 --> 25:07.157
There was a killer
- loose in the hotel.
- And yet

25:07.201 --> 25:09.464
you're still
- going to tell me.
- People were being murdered.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.727
I thought it was Adam.

25:11.771 --> 25:13.512
- You know what? Never mind.
- Good.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.514
Because corpses are
terrible for business.

25:15.557 --> 25:18.517
Luckily, it was just
a dream.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.519
So if you, uh, slept,

25:20.562 --> 25:22.521
I'm assuming
you finished your book?

25:22.564 --> 25:25.262
Because, I mean, you only
had one chapter to finish.

25:25.306 --> 25:27.743
I only have 13 pages written.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.789
13 pages?!

25:29.832 --> 25:31.921
Wha-What did you do
all night?

25:31.965 --> 25:34.489
Actually, what have you been
doing the last six months?

25:34.533 --> 25:37.579
I have writer's block, okay?

25:37.623 --> 25:40.060
Which is a problem
because my editor's going

25:40.103 --> 25:42.062
to be asking me about it
tonight at the party.

25:42.105 --> 25:43.411
Listen, I'm sure

25:43.454 --> 25:45.456
this has happened
to other writers before.

25:45.500 --> 25:47.197
You can just level with her.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.199
I don't know if I can.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.073
Can you just promise me
you won't say anything

25:53.116 --> 25:56.859
to her or Fallon?

25:58.861 --> 25:59.819
FALLON:Stacey?

25:59.862 --> 26:01.255
Oh, hey.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.909
Sorry to interrupt.

26:02.952 --> 26:04.737
I just want to see
if you changed your mind at all

26:04.780 --> 26:06.739
about coming
- to the premiere tonight.
- Oh, thank you again,

26:06.782 --> 26:08.044
but as much as I'd like to,

26:08.088 --> 26:09.002
I think it's probably best
that I stay home.

26:09.045 --> 26:10.438
At 5:00, my feet just

26:10.481 --> 26:11.831
swell up, so...

26:11.874 --> 26:13.267
But please
congratulate Liam for me.

26:13.310 --> 26:14.616
I will, I will,
and do you need anything

26:14.660 --> 26:16.052
from me before I go?

26:16.096 --> 26:17.576
No, I think we're all good.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.055
I've got my yoga,
I've got my snacks.

26:19.099 --> 26:20.622
Adam made me
a cup of tea earlier,

26:20.666 --> 26:22.450
and later I think
we're just going to relax.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.408
Well, I guess
I'll see you later tonight.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.627
- Stacey?
- Ooh.

26:25.671 --> 26:27.281
- Stacey, you okay?
- Ooh.

26:27.324 --> 26:28.630
Oh, God, you're not having
contractions, are you?

26:28.674 --> 26:29.675
Because I haven't
picked out an outfit

26:29.718 --> 26:31.024
for the baby yet
or for me.

26:31.067 --> 26:32.547
No, it's-it's nothing.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.071
It's, um... Ooh,
it's just a false contraction.

26:35.115 --> 26:38.074
It happens-- ugh-- sometimes
in the third trimester. It's...

26:38.118 --> 26:39.423
Okay, well, I'm glad you told me

26:39.467 --> 26:40.555
because I was worried
there for...

26:40.599 --> 26:42.426
Stacey?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.037
Stacey, are you sure
you're okay?

26:44.080 --> 26:47.562
Actually, I'm feeling
kind of dizzy.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.217
Stacey?! Stacey?!

26:50.260 --> 26:51.392
Please, someone help!

26:51.435 --> 26:53.699
Somebody help!
Oh, Stacey.

26:57.441 --> 26:59.879
Okay, her symptoms are
consistent with heat exhaustion,

26:59.922 --> 27:01.271
which could lead
to heatstroke, which is

27:01.315 --> 27:02.969
incredibly dangerous,
so I need to act now.

27:03.012 --> 27:04.535
The EMTs will be here
any minute.
Go get me

27:04.579 --> 27:06.320
some cold water and damp towels.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.930
The colder, the better,
all right? Go!

27:07.974 --> 27:10.019
Go, go, go, go!

27:11.064 --> 27:13.762
I'm gonna get you back
on your feet, all right?

27:19.463 --> 27:21.422
Just a few drops of this--

27:21.465 --> 27:23.554
there you go--

27:23.598 --> 27:26.340
and you're gonna feel
as good as new, promise.

27:27.950 --> 27:31.171
- What was that?
- Uh, that was just, um, saline solution.

27:31.214 --> 27:32.738
To help with dehydration.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.000
- It should kick in pretty quick.
Okay.

27:34.043 --> 27:35.479
I've got water,
I've got a towel.

27:35.523 --> 27:37.003
Hi. Hi. Here, here,
- have some water.
- Hi.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.439
- Thank you.
- Mm.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.180
Okay, this is gonna
cool you down, all right?

27:40.223 --> 27:41.529
Here we go.

27:41.572 --> 27:44.053
I don't...
know what happened,

27:44.097 --> 27:46.447
but I feel so much better.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.449
Maybe I just got overheated?

27:48.492 --> 27:50.233
Well, as you know,

27:50.277 --> 27:52.932
pregnancy does leave you
more susceptible to heat, so...

27:52.975 --> 27:55.151
You just weren't aware
that you overdid it.

27:55.195 --> 27:56.631
Okay, so,

27:56.675 --> 27:58.241
you're sure? You're fine?
I don't know.

27:58.285 --> 27:59.982
I feel like we should go
to the ER or something.

28:00.026 --> 28:03.029
No, she's-she's fine. The EMT's
gonna come check her out.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.205
Fallon, I'm so sorry.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.294
I should have known better
than to work out in this heat.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.470
You should go to Liam's party.
I-I'm fine.

28:09.513 --> 28:11.907
I don't think that's a good
idea. It's fine. I can stay.

28:11.951 --> 28:15.737
Please. If you miss this because
of me, I will feel terrible.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.087
Okay. All right, I'll go,
but if anything happens,

28:18.131 --> 28:19.828
will you please text me
immediately?

28:19.872 --> 28:21.830
And keep an eye on her.

28:21.874 --> 28:23.789
I'm on it.

28:28.010 --> 28:29.185
I loved it.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.753
The movie was amazing.

28:31.797 --> 28:33.973
MAN 2:
Had me in tears at that point.

28:34.016 --> 28:35.626
Well... Mm.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.367
I'm glad that went well.

28:37.411 --> 28:38.934
I think we convinced
all the reporters

28:38.978 --> 28:41.154
that we don't hate each other,
even Clara Lucia.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.591
You know, it's funny
how people mistake

28:43.634 --> 28:46.072
artistic conflict for bad blood.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.335
Exactly. I mean,
I'm a very passionate person

28:48.378 --> 28:50.946
when it comes to my work, and...

28:50.990 --> 28:52.818
other things.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.780
Are you actually considering

28:58.824 --> 29:01.522
going to Rio
to do a movie with your ex?

29:01.565 --> 29:02.958
Well, there's really nothing

29:03.002 --> 29:05.656
keeping me here in Atlanta,
so... who knows?

29:05.700 --> 29:06.919
I mean,
it's not like

29:06.962 --> 29:08.572
we don't make movies
here in Georgia.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.618
I mean, we are
the Hollywood of the South.

29:10.661 --> 29:13.012
Well, I haven't decided
what I'm gonna do yet.

29:13.055 --> 29:16.755
I guess you'll have to read
all about it in <i>Hot Tea Atlanta.</i>

29:19.148 --> 29:21.890
Michael, I wanted
to thank you

29:21.934 --> 29:23.544
for bringing me
onto the movie.

29:23.587 --> 29:25.502
I did love seeing my name
on the big screen.

29:25.546 --> 29:26.852
- You're welcome.
- You're lucky you got me

29:26.895 --> 29:28.897
before I won
the NordicStar contest.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.551
You wouldn't be able
to afford me now.

29:30.594 --> 29:31.944
- Right.
- That was a joke.

29:31.987 --> 29:33.423
What's going on with you?

29:33.467 --> 29:36.165
Oh.

29:36.209 --> 29:39.212
This is about Nina.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.954
You definitely got
between the sheets with her.

29:41.997 --> 29:44.478
- Am I right?
- What? No!

29:44.521 --> 29:46.045
- Why would you even say that?
- When I dropped off

29:46.088 --> 29:47.698
her clothes for the photo shoot,

29:47.742 --> 29:50.310
you two were at arm's length
the whole time.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.920
Then I saw you just now,

29:51.964 --> 29:54.096
talking in low tones,
inches from each other,

29:54.140 --> 29:56.577
the look in your eyes.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.187
Only one thing could make
that much of a difference.

29:58.231 --> 29:59.623
Fine.

29:59.667 --> 30:01.016
But it was a huge mistake.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.757
She and I drive each other crazy.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.064
Crazy in love, it seems.
You should think about that.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.456
Trust me.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.110
There's nothing to think about.

30:12.506 --> 30:14.551
I got to be honest.

30:14.595 --> 30:16.075
You don't look like someone

30:16.118 --> 30:17.990
who just had their book
turned into a big movie.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.992
Not that I would know what
that would look like, but...

30:20.035 --> 30:22.211
it has to be more exciting
than this. Yeah. No.

30:22.255 --> 30:24.126
It's great. It's just, um...

30:24.170 --> 30:26.172
Congratulations!

30:26.215 --> 30:27.390
Oh, God, it's my editor.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.739
Big news.
The powers-that-be

30:28.783 --> 30:30.089
want to rush your next book
to print

30:30.132 --> 30:31.612
to capitalize on this success!

30:31.655 --> 30:33.179
You're still going
to send it this week, right?

30:33.222 --> 30:34.571
I can't wait to read it.

30:34.615 --> 30:36.530
You know, I don't know.

30:36.573 --> 30:37.748
I just, um...

30:37.792 --> 30:39.098
Uh, I'm not sure
it's ready yet.

30:39.141 --> 30:41.404
Don't be modest, Liam.
I'm sure it's great.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.885
Yes, yes, of course
he'll send it.

30:43.929 --> 30:46.366
Right, yes. I will...

30:46.409 --> 30:48.020
I'll send it over this week.

30:48.063 --> 30:50.805
Great!

30:50.849 --> 30:52.328
<i>Well, I hope you're here</i>

30:52.372 --> 30:54.200
to deliver
the conditions of surrender.

30:54.243 --> 30:55.766
- Not quite.
- So, what?

30:55.810 --> 30:58.117
Just a fun, social visit?
Because I'm kind of busy.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.901
Too busy to apologize
for hacking

30:59.945 --> 31:01.903
into my tablet?

31:01.947 --> 31:03.426
Because I'm pretty sure

31:03.470 --> 31:05.080
that that hospital page
"calling me away"

31:05.124 --> 31:07.909
while you were in my office
was your doing.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.737
That's how you hacked
into PPA, isn't it?

31:09.780 --> 31:12.653
Okay, I may have uploaded
some malware onto your tablet

31:12.696 --> 31:15.351
so that when you logged into
the Carrington Wi-Fi at home,

31:15.395 --> 31:18.093
I could get
into any Carrington computer.

31:18.137 --> 31:20.095
I'd apologize, but I did
tell you things could get ugly.

31:20.139 --> 31:21.618
For someone so smart,

31:21.662 --> 31:23.098
you should realize

31:23.142 --> 31:25.057
that Blake isn't the only one
in charge there.

31:25.100 --> 31:28.799
Fair point, but I don't know if
Cristal's willing to negotiate.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.801
- She is.
- Security didn't tell me

31:30.845 --> 31:32.629
- you brought a friend.
- We all want this over

31:32.673 --> 31:34.936
before there's
any more damage.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.634
I can definitely make a fair
offer to buy back the companies.

31:37.678 --> 31:41.508
After what you did, I'm not sure
fair is part of the equation.

31:41.551 --> 31:43.902
I want market value
plus 20%.

31:43.945 --> 31:46.730
I'm liking this new,
savvier Cristal Carrington,

31:46.774 --> 31:48.819
so I'll go to 15.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.299
But what about Blake?

31:50.343 --> 31:51.735
Is he going to try
and quash this?

31:51.779 --> 31:53.128
Don't
worry about Blake.

31:53.172 --> 31:55.435
I'll handle him.

31:55.478 --> 31:58.438
Oof. I've been trying to avoid
that <i>Hot Tea Atlanta</i> reporter

31:58.481 --> 32:00.222
all night.
It is exhausting.

32:00.266 --> 32:01.920
Don't worry.
I took care of it.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.965
Well, my agent
took care of it.

32:04.009 --> 32:05.967
And I don't know what
she promised that writer,

32:06.011 --> 32:08.883
but there won't be any salacious
behind-the-scenes article.

32:08.927 --> 32:11.277
- Perfect.
- So...

32:11.320 --> 32:13.540
I guess this is it.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.976
Unless

32:15.020 --> 32:16.673
you want
to lend me your private jet

32:16.717 --> 32:18.284
to save me
a few hours down in Customs?

32:18.327 --> 32:19.720
Unfortunately,

32:19.763 --> 32:21.635
this judgmental, self-absorbed

32:21.678 --> 32:24.420
multimillionaire doesn't
actually own his own jet.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.900
Well, yet.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.947
Looks like I'm flying
commercial, then.

32:28.990 --> 32:30.426
My ex is out, by the way.

32:30.470 --> 32:32.124
Changed his mind.

32:32.167 --> 32:34.213
Like people do sometimes.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.954
Yeah.

32:37.999 --> 32:39.958
Bon voyage.

32:46.355 --> 32:48.531
Did you really just say
"Bon voyage"?

32:48.575 --> 32:50.098
She's not going
on the <i>Love Boat,</i>

32:50.142 --> 32:51.491
which is ironic, since

32:51.534 --> 32:53.145
she's clearly the woman
of your dreams,

32:53.188 --> 32:54.755
and you just let her walk away.

32:54.798 --> 32:56.800
Woman of my dreams?
It's more like nightmares.

32:56.844 --> 32:59.890
We didn't get along for
one minute on that movie shoot.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.718
She drives me crazy!

33:01.762 --> 33:04.069
And you still haven't figured
out why that fabulously talented

33:04.112 --> 33:07.115
and beautiful woman
drives you nuts?

33:07.159 --> 33:08.899
There's nothing to figure out.
Even if there was,

33:08.943 --> 33:11.250
what difference would it make?

33:11.293 --> 33:14.644
Nina couldn't get out that door
fast enough.

33:14.688 --> 33:16.646
That girl was in no rush.

33:16.690 --> 33:19.736
In fact, she was lingering,

33:19.780 --> 33:23.044
just waiting for a reason
to stick around.

33:23.088 --> 33:24.524
You could tell all that
just by watching us?

33:24.567 --> 33:25.916
Well, I was eavesdropping, too.

33:25.960 --> 33:27.005
None of this matters, Dom.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.964
Just because... we made one...

33:30.008 --> 33:32.619
great mistake upstairs

33:32.662 --> 33:36.144
does not change the fact
that she has been mad at me

33:36.188 --> 33:37.972
from the day we met.

33:41.497 --> 33:44.413
Did you just...
lick your fingers?

33:44.457 --> 33:46.372
Oh. Yeah, I'm sorry.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.069
I-I must have
caught that from...

33:48.113 --> 33:51.072
Mmm.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.990
You're right.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.253
She's the one!

33:58.297 --> 33:59.733
I got to go.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.343
Hmm.

34:06.522 --> 34:09.090
Nina, wait! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait!

34:09.134 --> 34:12.006
Don't drive off
until you hear me out.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.530
Okay, sure, when we first met,

34:14.574 --> 34:17.316
you thought I was a judgmental,

34:17.359 --> 34:19.100
self-absorbed rich guy.

34:19.144 --> 34:22.103
And maybe I thought that
you were bossy and stubborn.

34:22.147 --> 34:24.975
But that's because
we didn't know each other.

34:26.325 --> 34:31.199
But now I hope that you can see
past your first judgment of me.

34:31.243 --> 34:35.334
Yeah, and...
because I-I can see you

34:35.377 --> 34:37.423
for who you are.

34:38.989 --> 34:41.079
You are confident,

34:41.122 --> 34:43.168
you're beautiful,

34:43.211 --> 34:45.257
you're so incredibly talented.

34:47.302 --> 34:50.044
And the truth is...

34:50.088 --> 34:52.786
I'm crazy about you,

34:52.829 --> 34:56.268
questionable table manners
and all.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.229
- Thanks, buddy.
- What the...?

35:04.102 --> 35:06.234
♪ But I

35:06.278 --> 35:10.325
♪ I know that it's been worth

35:10.369 --> 35:13.067

35:16.070 --> 35:18.159

35:18.203 --> 35:22.816
♪ Yeah, it feels

35:23.817 --> 35:25.166
But right words.

35:25.210 --> 35:29.301
I stopped when I got a text
from Dominique.

35:29.344 --> 35:33.043
She said it's obvious
I was head over heels for you.

35:35.220 --> 35:37.613
And what else did she say?

35:37.657 --> 35:39.789
That you're one of
the most amazing men she knows.

35:39.833 --> 35:42.052
And that if I leave,

35:42.096 --> 35:44.577
I would be walking away
from the best thing

35:44.620 --> 35:46.579
that ever happened to me.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.537
Which is debatable.

35:50.539 --> 35:52.933
But I am willing
to be persuaded.

35:52.976 --> 35:56.545
♪ Somebody like you

35:56.589 --> 36:00.984
♪ And every time

36:06.947 --> 36:09.210
I appreciate you coming.
You really didn't have to.

36:09.254 --> 36:11.473
Of course. I wanted
to offer my congratulations

36:11.517 --> 36:13.345
and watch you
get celebrated.

36:13.388 --> 36:15.216
And now that I have,
I should probably go.

36:15.260 --> 36:17.218
Y-You're sure you can't stay
for the rest of the party?

36:17.262 --> 36:18.872
I'd love to,

36:18.915 --> 36:21.004
but I'm off to my secret
hideaway with my manuscript.

36:21.048 --> 36:23.006
I need to finish
addressing your notes.

36:23.050 --> 36:25.270
If it's ready, I'd be happy
to take your manuscript

36:25.313 --> 36:26.749
and give you my notes finally.

36:26.793 --> 36:29.099
Um...

36:29.143 --> 36:31.450
Look, I have a confession.

36:31.493 --> 36:33.626
I'm nowhere close
to being done.

36:33.669 --> 36:36.411
- With the final chapter?
- With of all the chapters.

36:38.935 --> 36:41.024
I think I'm terrified to fail.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.375
It's just, the more
encouraging everyone is,

36:43.418 --> 36:44.898
the more I want them to stop,

36:44.941 --> 36:46.465
because it's just
putting more pressure on me.

36:46.508 --> 36:48.206
Doubting yourself is just

36:48.249 --> 36:49.772
another way
of not facing the blank page.

36:49.816 --> 36:51.818
Look, we've all been there.

36:51.861 --> 36:53.776
But determined writers
find a way.

36:53.820 --> 36:55.822
Thanks.

36:55.865 --> 36:58.259
I think I really
needed to hear that.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.522
For the record,
I'm not saying

37:00.566 --> 37:04.047
that I wrote a Pulitzer Prize
winner with this new novel,

37:04.091 --> 37:06.093
especially since no one
has read it but you.

37:06.136 --> 37:09.270
But I finished, and
you'll find a way to get there,

37:09.314 --> 37:10.837
too, Liam.

37:10.880 --> 37:13.883
Professor,
- you're-you're bleeding.
- Am I?

37:15.494 --> 37:19.106
Professor Kingston!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

37:19.149 --> 37:21.239
Help!

37:21.282 --> 37:23.676
Professor Kingston, come on.

37:24.459 --> 37:26.853
- How was the premiere party?
- I left early.

37:26.896 --> 37:28.463
I know you told me
Stacey's fine,

37:28.507 --> 37:30.160
but I needed to see for myself.

37:30.204 --> 37:33.294
Also, you left this
on the credenza.

37:33.338 --> 37:36.210
Thank you. I appreciate that.

37:36.254 --> 37:39.126
And Stacey really is fine.

37:39.169 --> 37:40.910
All right? You don't have
to worry about her.

37:40.954 --> 37:42.303
Thank you
for staying so calm

37:42.347 --> 37:44.044
during all of that.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.567
You almost seemed
like a real doctor.

37:46.916 --> 37:49.267
Well, I was just a physician
doing his job.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.746
Even though
I'm not chief of staff,

37:50.790 --> 37:52.357
I did go to medical school.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.880
Well, about that.

37:53.923 --> 37:56.099
I'm, uh...
I'm gonna talk to Amanda

37:56.143 --> 37:57.666
about getting you your job back

37:57.710 --> 37:59.712
when I take Stacey
for her follow-up.

38:00.495 --> 38:02.323
Thank you.
I really appreciate that.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.759
Oh.

38:03.803 --> 38:05.805
And, uh, Stacey wanted to know

38:05.848 --> 38:08.808
if you could send up
your, uh, special herbal tea.

38:08.851 --> 38:10.810
- Apparently, it helps her sleep.
- Mm.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.160
No. I-I just don't
have any left,

38:13.203 --> 38:15.336
but, um, Stacey should just

38:15.380 --> 38:17.512
drink some water anyway.

38:17.556 --> 38:19.819
Doctor's orders.

38:19.862 --> 38:22.212
Besides, you...

38:22.256 --> 38:24.519
you never really know what's in
those herbal blends anyway.

38:24.563 --> 38:26.956
Yeah. You're right.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.045
- Well, good night.
- Good night.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.622
Maybe even
some dangerous mushrooms.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.852
- You betrayed me.
- Where have you been?

38:52.895 --> 38:54.723
- I've been trying to reach you.
- Really?

38:54.767 --> 38:56.464
Was that before
or after you decided

38:56.508 --> 38:58.423
to sell my Colby Co. assets
without telling me?

38:58.466 --> 39:00.555
- It's not that simple.
- My own wife undermined me.

39:00.599 --> 39:02.862
- Seems simple to me.
- I wanted

39:02.905 --> 39:07.475
our planes and shipping routes
back to normal, which they are.

39:07.519 --> 39:09.912
And I got our computer
systems upgraded

39:09.956 --> 39:12.088
and secured by Jeff himself.

39:12.132 --> 39:13.873
That's like
giving the bank robber

39:13.916 --> 39:15.657
the combination to the vault!

39:15.701 --> 39:17.746
Why would you give Jeff Colby
anything?

39:17.790 --> 39:20.619
Because this war
was spiraling out of control.

39:22.534 --> 39:24.405
Those companies
are rightfully mine.

39:24.449 --> 39:26.364
Is that why
you neglected them?

39:26.407 --> 39:27.843
You only bought them
out of revenge.

39:27.887 --> 39:30.193
Wha... And that's no way
to run a business.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.021
No offense, I don't need you to
tell me how to run a business.

39:32.065 --> 39:33.414
I'm not the one

39:33.458 --> 39:34.937
that went behind
my partner's back

39:34.981 --> 39:37.070
and sold assets out
from underneath him.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.899
- You should have consulted me.
- Like you consulted me

39:39.942 --> 39:42.728
when Jeff first approached you
about buying back the companies?

39:42.771 --> 39:44.164
It didn't even

39:44.207 --> 39:45.861
occur to you to ask me, did it?

39:45.905 --> 39:48.211
I'm the one
who should be insulted.

39:48.255 --> 39:52.955
This was the right decision for
the business, and you know that,

39:52.999 --> 39:55.305
which is why I'd do it again.

39:55.349 --> 39:56.829
Yeah,
I'm-I'm sorry.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.831
That's everything I can
think of right now.

40:03.270 --> 40:06.316
So, they think he died
of an aneurysm.

40:06.360 --> 40:09.363
A sudden bleed
in his brain.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.756
Yeah.

40:10.799 --> 40:11.713
I'm so sorry, Liam.

40:11.757 --> 40:13.933
I know how much
he meant to you.

40:13.976 --> 40:15.456
I knew him
a little bit.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.458
He sometimes liked
to write here, too.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.460
He always wanted
the same room.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.853
Let me guess.

40:20.896 --> 40:23.333
- Room 428?
- Yeah.

40:23.377 --> 40:26.598
- How'd you know?
- I guess he must have said something to me.

40:26.641 --> 40:30.210
Well, don't beat
yourself up, okay?

40:30.253 --> 40:32.604
They said there was nothing
anyone could have done, so...

40:32.647 --> 40:36.216
I should make sure the crowd is
clear so they can get through.

40:36.259 --> 40:39.045
Thank you, Sam.

40:50.839 --> 40:53.146
Hey, could you give...

41:11.947 --> 41:14.384
Excuse me.
Could you give this to the EMTs?

41:14.428 --> 41:17.605
It-it belonged to the victim.
His family might want it.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.477
Thank you.
