WEBVTT

00:01.523 --> 00:02.785
ROSSI: PREVIOUSLY ON
"CRIMINAL MINDS"...

00:02.828 --> 00:04.482
PRENTISS: OUR UNSUB
IS EVERETT LYNCH.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.702
HE'S A CON MAN
AND A MURDERER

00:06.745 --> 00:10.488
WHO SLICES OFF THE FACES
OF THE WOMEN HE SEDUCES.

00:12.099 --> 00:13.361
ROSSI: THIS WAS THE FIRST
TIME THAT I WAS BEATEN

00:13.404 --> 00:15.276
BY SOMEONE YOUNGER, FASTER,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.495
STRONGER THAN I AM.

00:20.759 --> 00:22.283
NOW, WHAT'S YOUR NAME?GRACE. I'M GRACE.

00:22.326 --> 00:23.284
GRACE?

00:23.327 --> 00:24.372
DADDY!

00:24.415 --> 00:26.809
ROSSI: WE ARRESTED
HIS DAUGHTER GRACE,

00:26.852 --> 00:28.419
BUT HE GOT AWAY.

00:35.252 --> 00:38.516
HONEY, DON'T BE SO HARD ON
YOURSELF. YOU JUST GAVE BIRTH,

00:38.560 --> 00:40.083
AND SOMEHOW
YOU'RE GLOWING.

00:40.127 --> 00:42.172
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
WHAT I'D LOOK LIKE.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.782
WOMAN, ON PHONE: THANKS.
YOU'RE SWEET.

00:43.826 --> 00:47.743
A LIAR, BUT SWEET.

00:47.786 --> 00:51.094
KIM, I KNOW WE'RE NOT
AS CLOSE AS WHEN WE WERE KIDS,

00:51.138 --> 00:54.750
BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY...
I'M SORRY THIS HAPPENED.

00:54.793 --> 00:57.970
AND ONE DAY YOU'LL BE
A FANTASTIC MOTHER,

00:58.014 --> 00:59.189
I PROMISE.

00:59.233 --> 01:02.018
CLARA'S UP.
YOU SHOULD GO.

01:02.062 --> 01:05.543
MMM. MAMA'S RIGHT
HERE, SWEETHEART. SHH...

01:05.587 --> 01:09.895
I'M SO HAPPY
FOR YOU, ANNIE.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.245
LOVE YOU.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.029
TALK TO YOU LATER.

01:41.884 --> 01:44.278
NO!

01:44.321 --> 01:46.236
NO!

01:50.153 --> 01:51.459
AAH!

01:54.418 --> 01:56.203
COME IN.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.340
HEARD FROM REID?
NO.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.995
HE USUALLY DISCONNECTS
WHEN HE'S OFF TEACHING
HIS SEMINAR,

02:06.038 --> 02:08.215
BUT HE'LL BE BACK
NEXT WEEK.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.913
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU
CARE ABOUT SPENCE,

02:10.956 --> 02:13.045
BUT THAT CAN'T BE
THE MAIN REASON YOU'RE
STANDING IN MY OFFICE

02:13.089 --> 02:16.484
AT MIDNIGHT WITH A FILE
IN YOUR HAND.

02:16.527 --> 02:19.182
THE LATEST ON
EVERETT LYNCH.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.709
DAVE, I APPRECIATE
YOUR EFFORT ON THIS,

02:24.753 --> 02:26.276
BUT WE HAVE A LOT
GOING ON.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.756
I NEED YOUR FOCUS HERE.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.366
I KNOW, I KNOW.

02:29.410 --> 02:33.065
IT'S MOVING SO SLOW.

02:33.109 --> 02:35.677
WE AREN'T ANY CLOSER
TO FINDING THIS JAG-OFF

02:35.720 --> 02:37.287
THAN WE WERE YESTERDAY.

02:37.331 --> 02:39.115
ANY LUCK WITH HIS
DAUGHTER GRACE?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.377
SHE DIDN'T SAY MUCH.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.727
PUT HER IN SOLITARY,
SEE HOW LONG SHE LASTS.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
IT'S GARCIA WITH A NEW CASE.

02:49.778 --> 02:53.956
LOOK, DAVE, I HAVE NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND, WE'LL GET HIM.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.219
BUT IF YOU TRY TO RUSH IT,

02:56.263 --> 02:58.743
THINGS WILL GET SLOPPY.

02:58.787 --> 03:01.224
YOU JUST HAVE TO
TRUST THE PROCESS.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.488
WHEN DO I NOT TRUST
THE PROCESS?

03:07.143 --> 03:08.840
GOOD POINT.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.976
YOU ARE HEADED
TO LEWISTON, MAINE.

03:14.019 --> 03:16.108
IT IS THE SECOND-LARGEST
CITY IN THE STATE.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.936
IT IS ALSO A PLACE THAT
COULD BE THE SETTING

03:17.980 --> 03:19.982
FOR ANY HORROR MOVIE
EVER MADE.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.853
IT'S ALSO WHERE TWO WOMEN
IN THE LAST 5 DAYS

03:21.897 --> 03:24.160
HAVE BEEN OVERPOWERED
WITH BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA

03:24.204 --> 03:26.118
AND STABBED 22 TIMES
IN THE STOMACH.

03:26.162 --> 03:28.947
NEITHER WERE MOTHERS
AND NEITHER WERE PREGNANT
AT THE TIME.

03:28.991 --> 03:31.254
THIS KIND OF
FRENZIED OVERKILL,

03:31.298 --> 03:32.473
IT FEELS PERSONAL.

03:32.516 --> 03:34.257
SO, DO WE HAVE
A PRIMARY SUSPECT?

03:34.301 --> 03:35.476
GARCIA: UH, NO.

03:35.519 --> 03:38.348
BUT VICTIM NUMBER ONE
WAS LINDA STAHL.

03:38.392 --> 03:40.611
SHE WAS SINGLE.
I CAN'T FIND AN EX
IN HER PAST.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.178
VICTIM NUMBER TWO,
KIM REYNOLDS,

03:42.222 --> 03:43.875
SHE WAS MARRIED.
HER HUSBAND WORKS NIGHTS.

03:43.919 --> 03:45.660
LET'S DOUBLE CHECK
HIS ALIBI.

03:45.703 --> 03:49.359
THIS UNSUB NOT ONLY
HAS THE GUTS TO ENTER
HIS VICTIMS' HOMES,

03:49.403 --> 03:51.492
BUT THESE KILLS ARE
VICIOUS AND QUICK.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.668
I WONDER HOW HE'S GETTING
INSIDE THE HOUSES.

03:53.711 --> 03:56.540
COULD USE A RUSE
OR HE'S GOOD AT
PICKING LOCKS.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.325
WELL, MAINE'S PRETTY
RURAL. I WOULDN'T
BE SURPRISED

03:58.368 --> 04:00.022
IF THESE VICTIMS DIDN'T
EVEN LOCK THEIR DOORS.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.198
AND BOTH HOUSES
HAD BASEMENTS.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.287
IT'S A COMMON POINT
OF VULNERABLE ACCESS.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.290
LEWIS: SO ARE WE LOOKING
FOR A MISOGYNIST HERE,
A SCORED LOVER,

04:07.334 --> 04:10.293
A GUY WITH MOMMY ISSUES,
OR A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE?

04:10.337 --> 04:12.948
REGARDLESS, OUR UNSUB
HAS SHOWN A HIGH LEVEL
OF VIOLENCE,

04:12.991 --> 04:14.341
A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RISKS,

04:14.384 --> 04:16.952
AND HE HAS STRUCK TWICE
IN LESS THAN A WEEK

04:16.995 --> 04:18.432
WITH NO SIGN HE'S
ABOUT TO STOP.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.347
WHEELS UP.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.399
MAN: I'VE GOT THIS.

04:29.443 --> 04:33.055
OH, NO, IT'S A LOT.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT ALONE.

04:33.098 --> 04:37.364
BUT YOU COOKED A 4-COURSE
MEAL FOR 6 PEOPLE ALONE.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.627
I AM EXHAUSTED.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.107
AND I HAVE TO BE
AT THE STUDIO REALLY
EARLY TOMORROW.

04:42.151 --> 04:44.458
I ONLY HAVE TWO WEEKS LEFT
UNTIL MY INSTALLATION.

04:44.501 --> 04:45.763
YOU'LL FINISH IN TIME.

04:45.807 --> 04:47.765
AND WHEN YOU DO,

04:47.809 --> 04:49.245
IT'LL BE YOUR
BEST SHOW YET.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.378
BEST.

04:51.421 --> 04:53.380
WE'LL SEE.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.676
CARLY?

05:35.944 --> 05:37.424
AAH! AAH...

06:17.638 --> 06:21.119
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
ABC STUDIOS, LLC AND CBS, INC.

06:27.430 --> 06:28.910
JAREAU:
"TERROR MADE ME CRUEL."

06:28.953 --> 06:31.303
EMILY BRONTE.

06:31.347 --> 06:34.219
IT IS WITH A HEAVY HEART
I REPORT THERE'S BEEN
A NEW SET OF VICTIMS.

06:34.263 --> 06:36.526
TWO ATTACKS IN LESS
THAN 12 HOURS.
HE'S SPEEDING UP.

06:36.570 --> 06:38.485
DID YOU SAY "SET,"
GARCIA?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.530
YEAH, I DID.
IT WAS A COUPLE THIS TIME--

06:40.574 --> 06:41.488
CARLY AND BRAD DAVIS.

06:41.531 --> 06:43.403
I'M SENDING YOU
THE INFO NOW.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.100
FIRST TIME IT'S
BEEN A COUPLE.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.537
BREAKING INTO A HOUSE
AND ATTACK ONE PERSON
IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH,

06:47.581 --> 06:51.280
BUT GOING IN WHILE
THERE'S TWO PEOPLE,
THAT'S EVEN RISKIER.

06:51.323 --> 06:53.108
BRAD WAS STABBED
IN THE STOMACH

06:53.151 --> 06:54.457
AND SEVERED
A MAJOR ARTERY.

06:54.501 --> 06:56.154
HE DIED ALMOST
INSTANTLY.

06:56.198 --> 06:58.287
CARLY WAS MURDERED
JUST LIKE THE FIRST
TWO VICTIMS,

06:58.330 --> 07:00.028
LINDA STAHL
AND KIM REYNOLDS--

07:00.071 --> 07:01.725
STABBED 22 TIMES
IN THE STOMACH.

07:01.769 --> 07:04.206
IT SAYS HERE BRAD
WAS STABBED 21 TIMES

07:04.249 --> 07:06.513
IN THE STOMACH POST-MORTEM.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.036
IT'S THAT NUMBER, 22.

07:08.079 --> 07:09.472
IT'S THE UNSUB'S COMPULSION.
HE CAN'T GET AWAY FROM IT.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.343
THEN WE NEED TO
FIGURE OUT WHY.

07:11.387 --> 07:15.435
WELL, AGE SEEMS TO BE
THE ONE OVERLAP BETWEEN
THE 3 FEMALE VICTIMS.

07:15.478 --> 07:17.741
THEY WERE ALL BORN
WITHIN A YEAR OF
EACH OTHER.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.439
THEY COULD BE
SURROGATES.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.701
WELL, LET'S TRY TO FIND
A DEEPER CONNECTION

07:20.744 --> 07:22.398
BETWEEN THOSE THREE.GARCIA: I'M ALL OVER THAT.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.401
WHEN WE LAND, DAVE, MATT,
HEAD TO THE M.E.'s OFFICE.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.925
TARA, JJ, YOU'LL GO TO
THE LATEST CRIME SCENE.

07:27.969 --> 07:30.450
LUKE, YOU AND I WILL
SET UP WITH THE LEWISTON P.D.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.240
DETECTIVE MILEY,
I'M SSA EMILY PRENTISS
WITH THE FBI.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.329
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE,
SSA LUKE ALVEZ.

07:40.372 --> 07:42.200
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU BOTH.
WELCOME TO LEWISTON.

07:42.244 --> 07:43.332
THANKS FOR INVITING US IN.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.594
ONCE IT HAPPENED
A SECOND TIME,

07:44.638 --> 07:45.726
I KNEW WE COULDN'T
HANDLE IT ON OUR OWN.

07:45.769 --> 07:47.597
IS THERE SOME PLACE
WE CAN SET UP?

07:47.641 --> 07:49.164
YEP. CONFERENCE ROOM'S
RIGHT OVER THERE,

07:49.207 --> 07:51.427
AND JEFF REYNOLDS,
KIM'S HUSBAND, IS HERE

07:51.471 --> 07:52.646
AND READY TO BE INTERVIEWED.

07:52.689 --> 07:53.864
GREAT. WE'LL START
WITH HIM.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.736
RIGHT THIS WAY.

07:55.779 --> 07:58.913
KIM WAS DESPERATE
TO HAVE KIDS.

07:58.956 --> 08:00.436
IT TOOK US ALMOST
3 YEARS,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.264
BUT WE FINALLY
GOT PREGNANT.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.267
AND THE DAY AFTER
WE FOUND OUT,

08:05.310 --> 08:07.487
WE STARTED BUILDING
THE NURSERY.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.490
BUT...

08:10.533 --> 08:13.144
THEN A FEW WEEKS LATER,
SHE MISCARRIED.

08:14.624 --> 08:16.626
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE,
HER SISTER JUST GAVE BIRTH

08:16.670 --> 08:18.846
TO HER THIRD,
A GIRL THIS TIME.

08:18.889 --> 08:21.022
KIM WAS CRUSHED.

08:21.065 --> 08:23.938
I'M REALLY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT, JEFF.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.506
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW DIFFICULT THAT
MUST HAVE BEEN.

08:26.549 --> 08:29.900
IT MADE OUR RECENT
ARGUMENTS AROUND
THE HOUSE EVEN WORSE.

08:29.944 --> 08:31.859
WHAT WAS HAPPENING
WITH YOUR HOUSE?

08:31.902 --> 08:33.600
WE BOTH STARTED
HEARING NOISES.

08:33.643 --> 08:35.471
WHAT KIND?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.821
I FIGURED IT WAS MICE.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.563
I SET TRAPS,
CALLED PEST CONTROL,

08:40.607 --> 08:42.130
BUT NOTHING.

08:42.173 --> 08:44.611
KIM DIDN'T THINK IT
WAS MICE, DID SHE?

08:46.090 --> 08:48.919
NO.

08:48.963 --> 08:50.921
SHE THOUGHT
IT WAS FOOTSTEPS.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.883
WE ARGUED THAT, UM...

08:57.624 --> 09:00.017
WHAT DID YOU
ARGUE ABOUT?

09:00.061 --> 09:01.889
I MEAN, IF SOMEBODY WAS
INSIDE OF OUR HOUSE,

09:01.932 --> 09:03.281
WE WOULD HAVE
SEEN THEM, RIGHT?

09:04.544 --> 09:06.284
UNDER NORMAL
CIRCUMSTANCES, YES.

09:06.328 --> 09:08.112
PRENTISS: BUT AFTER
HEARING THIS,

09:08.156 --> 09:11.463
JEFF, WE THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

09:11.507 --> 09:15.424
THIS OFFENDER WAS IN
YOUR HOME BEFORE
YOUR WIFE'S MURDER.

09:15.467 --> 09:18.383
WE NEED TO KNOW IF YOU
SAW ANYBODY NEW

09:18.427 --> 09:19.602
HANGING AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.691
WAIT.

09:21.735 --> 09:23.650
I COULD HAVE STOPPED THIS?

09:27.654 --> 09:29.307
PRENTISS: IF KIM WANTED
TO GET PREGNANT,

09:29.351 --> 09:31.135
MAYBE LINDA AND CARLY
DID, TOO.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.920
WE'LL HAVE GARCIA
LOOK INTO IT.

09:32.963 --> 09:36.227
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE UNSUB RAN PRE-ATTACK
SURVEILLANCE ON KIM.

09:36.271 --> 09:37.577
I BET HE DID THE SAME
WITH THE OTHERS.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.970
TO GET IN AND OUT
OF HOUSES LIKE THIS,

09:40.014 --> 09:43.147
OUR UNSUB MUST ALSO BE
SAVVY AND EXPERIENCED.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.845
IT'S CLASSIC
PRE-CURSOR BEHAVIOR.

09:44.888 --> 09:46.934
AND IF NOBODY SAW HIM
CASING THE AREA,

09:46.977 --> 09:48.588
HE MUST BLEND IN.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.720
IN SOME WAY, THIS GUY'S
THE PERFECT UNSUB.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.896
WE'VE BUSTED
PERFECT BEFORE.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.377
WE'LL START BY
RE-CANVASSING THE
VICTIMS' NEIGHBORHOODS.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.554
HOPEFULLY SOMEBODY SAW
HIM COMING OR GOING.

10:07.432 --> 10:08.651
YOU'RE WITH THE FBI.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.653
YEAH. AND YOU ARE?

10:10.697 --> 10:12.307
COURTNEY MABLY,
BLOGGER,

10:12.350 --> 10:15.571
LOCAL LORE EXPERT,
CURATOR OF THE LEWISTON
HISTORICAL SOCIETY.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.704
WHEN I HEARD THERE WAS
A CRIME AT THIS HOUSE,
I HAD TO GET HERE.

10:17.747 --> 10:20.620
AND WHAT'S
SO SPECIAL ABOUT
THIS HOUSE?

10:20.663 --> 10:22.012
WELL, LITTLE-KNOWN FACT,

10:22.056 --> 10:23.666
60 YEARS AGO, A MAN
KILLED HIS WIFE HERE.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.668
STABBED HER IN
THE STOMACH WITH
A KITCHEN KNIFE

10:25.712 --> 10:27.583
BEFORE CUTTING
HIS OWN THROAT.

10:27.627 --> 10:28.932
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?

10:28.976 --> 10:31.587
SO THEN YOU ALSO
DON'T KNOW THIS
PLACE IS HAUNTED.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.893
HAUNTED?

10:32.936 --> 10:34.721
YES, THE GHOST OF
MRS. KANTE ROAMS
THE GROUNDS

10:34.764 --> 10:36.157
LOOKING FOR VENGEANCE.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.375
IT'S SUPER COOL.

10:37.419 --> 10:39.726
COURTNEY, I LOVE
YOUR ENTHUSIASM,

10:39.769 --> 10:45.035
BUT, UM, PEOPLE ARE
DYING AND THERE IS
A KILLER ON THE LOOSE.

10:45.079 --> 10:47.255
YEAH.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.692
I'M SORRY.
SO SORRY.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.347
I WILL TOTALLY GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

10:55.742 --> 10:58.788
SO THE DAVIS MURDERS
JUST HAPPENED.

10:58.832 --> 11:00.703
HOW'D COURTNEY
KNOW ABOUT THEM?

11:00.747 --> 11:02.400
YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD QUESTION.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.316
A POLICE SCANNER,
MAYBE A FRIEND ON THE FORCE,

11:05.360 --> 11:07.449
INSERTING HERSELF
INTO THE INVESTIGATION.

11:07.492 --> 11:09.756
WELL, LET'S HAVE
GARCIA LOOK INTO HER.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.410
YEAH.

11:12.454 --> 11:15.500
SO WE KNOW THE UNSUB
SPENT EXTENSIVE TIME

11:15.544 --> 11:17.154
AT THE VICTIMS' HOUSES,

11:17.198 --> 11:18.547
BUT I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WE DIDN'T FIND ONE SHRED

11:18.590 --> 11:21.768
OF DNA OR PRINT EVIDENCE
AT ANY OF THE CRIME SCENES.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.771
YEAH, THAT ON ITS OWN
SHOWS A LEVEL OF SKILL,

11:24.814 --> 11:28.339
FORENSIC SOPHISTICATION,
AND PRE-MEDITATION.

11:28.383 --> 11:31.516
AT THE REYNOLDS' HOUSE,
THE UNSUB USED THE TIP
OF HIS KNIFE

11:31.560 --> 11:33.736
TO REMOVE THE DOORKNOB
AND GET TO KIM IN HER
LOCKED BEDROOM.

11:33.780 --> 11:36.478
YEAH, THEY ALSO FOUND
A FIREPLACE POKER

11:36.521 --> 11:39.307
NEAR KIM'S BODY,
SO SHE FOUGHT BACK.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.875
THE UNSUB MIGHT HAVE
SUSTAINED INJURIES.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.051
WE SHOULD CHECK LOCAL
HOSPITALS JUST IN CASE.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.923
IF THE UNSUB HAD TO
DISARM KIM BEFORE
HE COULD ATTACK HER,

11:46.967 --> 11:49.273
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
A LOT MORE WORK FOR HIM.

11:49.317 --> 11:53.147
YEAH, WELL, THIS TIME
LOOKS LIKE HE LEARNED
FROM THAT EXPERIENCE.

11:53.190 --> 11:55.149
RIGHT, RIGHT.
CARLY WAS ASLEEP.

11:55.192 --> 11:56.846
SHE WAS AN EASY TARGET.

11:56.890 --> 11:59.240
AND THE ONLY OBSTACLE
THIS TIME WOULD HAVE
BEEN HER HUSBAND BRAD.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.764
BUT THE UNSUB GOT THE JUMP
ON HIM OUT IN THE HALLWAY.

12:01.808 --> 12:04.593
THE UNSUB'S ABILITY
TO LEARN FROM PAST
NEAR MISTAKES

12:04.636 --> 12:07.117
HAS LED TO A SUBTLE
SHIFT IN TACTICS.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.076
THE UNSUB'S EVOLVING.

12:10.642 --> 12:14.995
JJ, IS THERE A PILE
OF SALT IN THE CORNER
WHERE YOU'RE STANDING?

12:15.038 --> 12:17.345
YEAH.

12:17.388 --> 12:19.869
THERE'S SALT IN ALL
4 CORNERS OF THIS ROOM.

12:19.913 --> 12:22.872
YEAH, SALT IS USED TO
WARD OFF SPIRITS.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.570
AND GIVEN THE HISTORY
OF THIS HOUSE...

12:25.614 --> 12:26.789
RIGHT. WELL, THEN
THE QUESTION BECOMES,

12:26.833 --> 12:29.487
DID CARLY LEAVE
THE SALT BEHIND

12:29.531 --> 12:31.751
OR DID THE UNSUB?

12:50.682 --> 12:53.816
MICHELLE, YOU ALREADY
TOOK A SHOWER TONIGHT.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.166
TURN OFF THE WATER.

12:59.169 --> 13:01.824
MOM?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.434
I DIDN'T TURN IT ON.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.568
GO GET YOUR PHONE
AND CALL 9-1-1.

13:43.997 --> 13:47.522
PER EMILY'S REQUEST,
I LOOKED INTO POSSIBLE
CONCEPTION CONNECTIONS

13:47.565 --> 13:49.045
BETWEEN THE FEMALE VICTIMS.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.525
LOOKS LIKE KIM WAS
TRYING TO GET PREGNANT,

13:50.568 --> 13:52.483
BUT LINDA AND CARLY
WERE NOT.

13:52.527 --> 13:54.616
HOWEVER, WHEN I LOOKED
INTO THE PAST

13:54.659 --> 13:57.619
MURDER-SUICIDE
AT THE DAVIS HOUSE,

13:57.662 --> 13:59.577
I DID FIND A CONNECTION--
THE HOUSES.

13:59.621 --> 14:03.364
JAREAU: SO EACH HAS A
VIOLENT HISTORY FOLLOWED
BY A GHOST STORY.

14:03.407 --> 14:06.106
YEAH, YEAH. IT'S LIKE THEY
EACH HAVE A UNIQUE PLACE
IN THE CITY'S LORE.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.717
BUT IF ALL THESE MURDERS
TOOK PLACE AT SO-CALLED
HAUNTED HOUSES,

14:08.760 --> 14:11.415
THEN THE KILLS ARE ABOUT
THE HOUSES, NOT THE WOMEN.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.809
GARCIA, WE NEED
A LIST OF HOMES WITH
SIMILAR HISTORIES

14:13.853 --> 14:15.898
THAT FALL INSIDE
THE UNSUB'S
COMFORT ZONE.

14:15.942 --> 14:18.205
GARCIA: OK, I WILL WORK
ON THAT LIST RIGHT NOW.

14:18.248 --> 14:21.077
OOH! AND ALL THE VICTIMS'
HOUSES HAVE ANOTHER
THING IN COMMON.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.514
THEY HAVE EACH BEEN
HEAVILY CHRONICLED

14:23.558 --> 14:26.343
BY A CERTAIN PERSON,
IN PARTICULAR ON HER BLOG.

14:26.387 --> 14:28.258
LEWIS: LET ME GUESS.
COURTNEY MABLY,

14:28.302 --> 14:29.738
THE WOMAN WE MET
AT THE DAVIS HOUSE.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.348
GARCIA:
DON'T YOU KNOW IT.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.524
AND I DID SOME RESEARCH
ON COURTNEY, TOO.

14:33.568 --> 14:34.917
SHE IS A LEWISTON NATIVE.

14:34.961 --> 14:36.571
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH
LOCAL LORE.

14:36.614 --> 14:39.052
ONCE UPON A TIME,
SHE WAS AN O.R. NURSE,

14:39.095 --> 14:41.576
BUT SHE WAS FIRED FOR
GETTING IN A VIOLENT OUTBURST

14:41.619 --> 14:44.709
AT HER BOSS, WHICH
SHE VEHEMENTLY DENIES.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.668
AND IT LOOKS LIKE SHE
MAKES MOST OF HER MONEY
OFF OF HER BLOG.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.191
SO WE KNEW ABOUT
COURTNEY'S OBSESSION.

14:48.235 --> 14:49.627
NOW IT'S ALSO CLEAR
THAT SHE HAS SOME SKILL

14:49.671 --> 14:50.802
AND A VIOLENT HISTORY.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.588
WELL, BECAUSE THE KILLS
WERE SO RUTHLESS,

14:53.631 --> 14:56.156
WE ASSUMED THE UNSUB'S
A MAN, BUT WHAT IF IT ISN'T?

14:56.199 --> 15:00.900
SO I FOUND 7 LOCATIONS
THAT MATCH THAT CRITERIA--

15:00.943 --> 15:03.990
VIOLENT HISTORY, HAUNTED,
IN THE RIGHT ZONE.

15:04.033 --> 15:06.383
I'M SENDING YOU
THOSE ADDRESSES NOW.

15:06.427 --> 15:10.257
HOLD ON. A 9-1-1 CALL
LITERALLY JUST CAME IN,

15:10.300 --> 15:11.780
AND IT'S FROM ONE
OF THOSE ADDRESSES.

15:11.823 --> 15:15.479
A NATASHA THOMPSON
LIVES THERE WITH HER
DAUGHTER MICHELLE.

15:15.523 --> 15:16.654
I'M SENDING YOU THE INFO.
HERE IT IS.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.266
JJ AND TARA,
GET OVER THERE NOW.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.355
MATT, LET'S GET
THE REST OF THE TEAM.

15:21.398 --> 15:23.574
I STILL WANT PEOPLE AT
THOSE OTHER ADDRESSES

15:23.618 --> 15:25.881
IN CASE COURTNEY'S
ON THE MOVE.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.997
COURTNEY...

15:55.041 --> 15:58.435
RAISE YOUR HANDS SLOWLY.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.934
COURTNEY.

16:20.936 --> 16:25.854
I'M SSA DAVID ROSSI
WITH THE FBI.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.944
WE FOUND YOU COVERED
IN THE VICTIM'S BLOOD.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.338
YOU'RE SMART.

16:31.381 --> 16:32.861
YOU KNOW HOW THAT LOOKS.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.385
I WAS THERE TO HELP.

16:37.257 --> 16:39.433
I SAW HER.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.130
THE BLOOD.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.264
I TRIED TO HELP.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.788
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU,

16:46.831 --> 16:49.443
BUT THERE'S REALLY
ONLY ONE WAY

16:49.486 --> 16:50.922
YOU COULD HAVE
BEATEN US THERE.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.229
NO. I GOT LUCKY.

16:53.273 --> 16:57.320
I'VE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
ROLL UP ON A DEAD BODY

16:57.364 --> 17:01.759
INSIDE OF A HOUSE
THEY DIDN'T LIVE IN
BY CHANCE.

17:04.153 --> 17:06.938
AFTER THE LAST MURDER,

17:06.982 --> 17:09.898
I DECIDED TO TRY
AND FIGURE OUT

17:09.941 --> 17:12.074
WHICH HOUSE THE KILLER
MIGHT GO TO NEXT.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.903
I LANDED ON
3 POSSIBLE OPTIONS.

17:14.946 --> 17:19.125
I JUST SO HAPPENED
TO GO TO THE THOMPSON
HOUSE FIRST.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.778
I'D NEVER MET THEM.

17:20.822 --> 17:23.999
I JUST LOOKED UP
WHO LIVED THERE.

17:24.043 --> 17:28.090
AND THE SECOND I SAW
THE DOOR WAS OPENED

17:28.134 --> 17:30.658
AND THE LIGHTS WERE OFF,
I KNEW I WAS RIGHT.

17:30.701 --> 17:34.009
YOU CHOSE THE THOMPSON
HOUSE BECAUSE OF ITS
HISTORY, DIDN'T YOU?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.576
YES.

17:35.619 --> 17:38.274
10 YEARS AGO,
THE HOMEOWNER WAS

17:38.318 --> 17:41.364
STABBED AND MURDERED
AFTER TAKING A BATH.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.105
SHE'S HAUNTED THE
PLACE EVER SINCE.

17:43.149 --> 17:45.760
AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY
YOU FILLED THE TUB WITH WATER.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.110
NO. NO.

17:48.154 --> 17:49.807
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.027
IT'S NOT JUST
YOUR FASCINATION
WITH GHOST STORIES

17:52.071 --> 17:53.898
OR HAUNTED HOUSES
OR EVEN THE FACT

17:53.942 --> 17:56.814
THAT WE FOUND YOU THERE.

17:56.858 --> 17:58.164
IT'S YOU.

18:00.601 --> 18:05.606
YOU SEE, IN MY LINE OF WORK,

18:05.649 --> 18:08.478
PATTERNS OF PAST BEHAVIOR

18:08.522 --> 18:11.481
ARE OFTEN THE BEST INDICATORS

18:11.525 --> 18:12.961
OF FUTURE BEHAVIOR.

18:13.004 --> 18:15.920
AND YOUR PAST,
THE LIFE-LONG OBSESSION,

18:15.964 --> 18:17.922
THE VIOLENT INCIDENT,

18:17.966 --> 18:20.838
IT PAINTS A CERTAIN PICTURE,

18:20.882 --> 18:24.233
A PICTURE THAT COULD
ALLOW ME TO UNDERSTAND

18:24.277 --> 18:27.584
WHY YOU WOULD TARGET
THESE HOMES

18:27.628 --> 18:30.196
AND STAB THESE VICTIMS.

18:33.677 --> 18:36.506
BUT...

18:36.550 --> 18:38.943
I'VE BEEN A PROFILER
LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW

18:38.987 --> 18:41.990
THAT OFTEN ISN'T ALWAYS.

18:42.033 --> 18:45.559
SO...

18:45.602 --> 18:49.040
I WANT YOU TO
TELL ME EVERYTHING,

18:49.084 --> 18:53.871
BECAUSE THERE'S A LITTLE
GIRL DOWN THE HALL WHO SURVIVED,

18:53.915 --> 18:58.572
AND SHE IS TELLING US
EVERYTHING.

19:00.617 --> 19:02.837
HI, MICHELLE.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.795
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

19:04.839 --> 19:06.319
YES.

19:06.362 --> 19:09.148
YOU'RE TARA FROM THE FBI,

19:09.191 --> 19:12.020
AND YOU FOUND ME
BEHIND THE CHAIR.

19:12.063 --> 19:13.891
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.676
I NEED TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS

19:15.719 --> 19:17.417
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
TONIGHT.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.115
AND IF AT ANY TIME IT
BECOMES TOO OVERWHELMING,

19:20.159 --> 19:22.813
YOU TELL ME AND WE'LL
STOP RIGHT AWAY, OK?

19:22.857 --> 19:23.814
OK.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.860
OK.

19:25.903 --> 19:28.428
NOW, TELL ME WHAT
HAPPENED TONIGHT,

19:28.471 --> 19:32.040
AND START AS CLOSE TO
THE BEGINNING AS YOU CAN.

19:33.650 --> 19:36.262
MY MOM YELLED FOR ME
TO TURN OFF THE BATH WATER,

19:36.305 --> 19:38.960
BUT IT WASN'T ME.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.875
AND I TOLD HER THAT.

19:40.918 --> 19:43.878
OK. THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

19:43.921 --> 19:47.055
MY MOM HAD ME CALL 9-1-1.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.710
SHE RAN UPSTAIRS.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.539
MY MOM SCREAMED...

19:52.582 --> 19:55.542
SO I HID.

19:58.545 --> 20:02.897
I HEARD FOOTSTEPS MOVE
SLOWLY DOWN THE STAIRS.

20:05.508 --> 20:10.948
AND THEN...I SAW A MASK.

20:25.485 --> 20:27.095
LEWIS: IT'S OK.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.618
COULD YOU TELL IF
THE PERSON IN THE MASK

20:28.662 --> 20:30.141
WAS A MAN OR A WOMAN?

20:30.185 --> 20:31.055
A WOMAN.

20:31.099 --> 20:32.361
YOU'RE POSITIVE?

20:32.405 --> 20:35.625
YES. SHE TOOK IT OFF.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.018
MICHELLE...

20:40.108 --> 20:42.153
IS THIS THE WOMAN
THAT YOU SAW?

20:43.372 --> 20:46.114
NO, THAT'S NOT HER.

20:46.157 --> 20:48.551
ALL RIGHT.

20:48.595 --> 20:50.640
YOU DID GREAT.

20:53.252 --> 20:58.561
COURTNEY, YOU ARE
FREE TO GO.

21:08.179 --> 21:10.399
DID THEY CATCH
THE KILLER YET?

21:10.443 --> 21:14.055
NO, NOT YET.

21:15.274 --> 21:19.626
BUT WE THINK WHOEVER IT IS
HAS SIMILAR INTERESTS TO YOU.

21:19.669 --> 21:22.019
SO WOULD YOU MIND
ANSWERING SOME QUESTIONS

21:22.063 --> 21:24.152
ABOUT THE COMMUNITY FOR US?

21:24.195 --> 21:26.633
OF COURSE NOT.
ANYTHING YOU NEED.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.203
MICHELLE THOMPSON,
THE LITTLE GIRL,

21:32.247 --> 21:36.033
IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,

21:36.077 --> 21:38.166
IS SHE GONNA BE OK?

21:39.820 --> 21:43.127
I DON'T KNOW...

21:43.171 --> 21:45.304
BUT I'M ALWAYS HOPEFUL.

21:47.741 --> 21:49.743
WE'RE ABOUT TO LET
COURTNEY GO.

21:49.786 --> 21:51.962
HER STORY CHECKS OUT.
MICHELLE CAN'T I.D. HER,

21:52.006 --> 21:53.747
AND WE DIDN'T FIND HER
DNA IN THE BATHTUB.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.184
OK. AND IF MICHELLE'S
UP FOR IT,

21:56.227 --> 21:57.316
LET'S HAVE HER WORK
WITH A SKETCH ARTIST.

21:57.359 --> 21:58.839
I'LL ASK HER.

21:58.882 --> 22:02.059
WE ALSO FOUND SAGE
BURNING AT THE CRIME
SCENE THIS TIME.

22:02.103 --> 22:03.670
WE THINK THE UNSUB LEFT IT

22:03.713 --> 22:05.672
BECAUSE WE ALSO FOUND
PILES OF SALT

22:05.715 --> 22:08.327
IN ALL 4 CORNERS OF
THE BEDROOM THE WAY WE
DID AT THE DAVIS HOUSE.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.807
SO THE UNSUB KILLS
HER VICTIMS,

22:10.851 --> 22:13.549
THEN PLACES THE SALT
AND BURNS SAGE.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.508
GIVEN THE HISTORY
OF THE SITES,

22:15.551 --> 22:17.248
I KNOW WHAT
THE UNSUB'S DOING.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.990
LET'S DELIVER THE PROFILE.

22:20.034 --> 22:21.731
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
A GHOST HUNTER?

22:21.775 --> 22:23.385
NO, WE ARE LOOKING
FOR A SERIAL KILLER

22:23.429 --> 22:25.387
WHO IS OBSESSED
WITH THE PARANORMAL.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.215
JAREAU: SHE'S FEMALE,
PROBABLY LOCAL,

22:27.258 --> 22:29.391
AND HAS EXTENSIVE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE
CITY'S LORE.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.914
THIS UNSUB IS
MISSION-DRIVEN

22:30.958 --> 22:32.002
AND LIKELY
DELUSIONAL.

22:32.046 --> 22:34.048
THIS DELUSION MAY STEM
FROM THE FACT

22:34.091 --> 22:36.137
THAT SHE THINKS
THE HOUSES ARE HAUNTED

22:36.180 --> 22:38.095
AND THAT THE RESIDENTS
ARE INFECTED BY EVIL.

22:38.139 --> 22:41.098
TO HER, THE ONLY WAY
TO KILL THE DEMON
AND SAVE THE PEOPLE

22:41.142 --> 22:43.666
IS BY STABBING THEM
22 TIMES IN THE STOMACH.

22:43.710 --> 22:45.320
ROSSI: AND AT THIS POINT,
IT'S STILL UNCLEAR

22:45.364 --> 22:47.540
WHY SHE VALUES
THE NUMBER 22.

22:47.583 --> 22:49.019
ALVEZ: WE HAVE A SKETCH
ARTIST WORKING

22:49.063 --> 22:50.760
WITH THE DAUGHTER OF
OUR LATEST VICTIM.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.240
PRENTISS: AND WE'LL BE
CANVASSING THE AREA

22:52.283 --> 22:53.807
SURROUNDING THE OTHER
HAUNTED SITES

22:53.850 --> 22:56.070
IN AN EFFORT TO PREDICT
HER NEXT MOVE.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.159
THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR TIME.

23:25.752 --> 23:27.754
ALVEZ: ROSSI.

23:27.797 --> 23:29.756
WAS COURTNEY HELPFUL?

23:29.799 --> 23:33.803
YEAH. SHE GAVE ME
A LIST OF 5 LOCAL
PARANORMAL INVESTIGATORS

23:33.847 --> 23:35.588
THAT MIGHT FIT
OUR PROFILE.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.459
I JUST TEXTED IT
TO GARCIA.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.157
ALL RIGHT. WELL, WHILE GARCIA
GETS A HANDLE ON THAT LIST,

23:40.201 --> 23:42.464
WHY DON'T WE CHECK IN
ON MICHELLE, SEE HOW
SHE'S HOLDING UP.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.253
GARCIA, WHAT CAN
YOU TELL US ABOUT

23:49.297 --> 23:51.038
COURTNEY'S LIST
OF INVESTIGATORS?

23:51.081 --> 23:53.257
GARCIA: HERE'S THE THING.
I JUST STARTED THAT SEARCH.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.346
I'M ACTUALLY CALLING YOU
WITH A LIST OF MY OWN.

23:55.390 --> 23:58.132
I'VE GOT 5 MORE PLACES THE UNSUB
MIGHT BE TARGETING NEXT.

23:58.175 --> 24:01.352
THEY'RE A LITTLE LESSER KNOWN,
BUT THEY FIT THE PARAMETERS--

24:01.396 --> 24:05.095
HAUNTED, VIOLENT HISTORY,
RIGHT IN THE UNSUB'S
COMFORT ZONE.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.488
THANKS, GARCIA.

24:06.532 --> 24:07.881
WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE US A CALL BACK

24:07.924 --> 24:09.273
ONCE YOU GET A HANDLE
ON COURTNEY'S LIST.

24:09.317 --> 24:11.362
OH, ALVEZ, HAVE YOU HEARD
OF MULTITASKING?

24:11.406 --> 24:12.755
IT'S ALL THE RAGE,
I'M REALLY GOOD AT IT,

24:12.799 --> 24:14.714
AND I'M DOING IT RIGHT NOW.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.759
YEAH, I'M SURE YOU WERE.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.892
DON'T GET ME WRONG.
YOU'RE GREAT,

24:18.935 --> 24:21.503
BUT ROSSI LITERALLY
JUST SENT YOU THAT LIST.

24:21.547 --> 24:23.984
YEAH, WELL, I'M MORE
THAN SIMPLY GREAT.

24:24.027 --> 24:25.289
I'M ENTIRELY FANTASTIC.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.423
AND ONE OF THOSE NAMES
IS RINGING ALL THE BELLS.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.861
STEPHANIE CARTER.
SHE'S A RELIGIOUS
STUDIES PROFESSOR

24:31.905 --> 24:33.384
AT THE LOCAL COLLEGE.

24:33.428 --> 24:35.386
SHE INVESTIGATES
THE PARANORMAL WITH
HER HUSBAND PATRICK,

24:35.430 --> 24:37.519
WHO IS A PSYCH PROFESSOR
AT THE SAME PLACE.

24:37.563 --> 24:38.912
WHAT MAKES HER
STAND OUT?

24:38.955 --> 24:40.522
SHE'S WRITTEN SEVERAL
ACADEMIC PAPERS

24:40.566 --> 24:44.918
ABOUT DEMONOLOGY
AND ITS STRONG HOLD
ON THE HUMAN BODY

24:44.961 --> 24:47.311
AND THE VARIOUS METHODS
OF REMOVAL.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.357
THAT CHECKS A LOT
OF OUR BOXES.

24:49.400 --> 24:50.489
OH, HERE'S ANOTHER TICK.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.273
MICHELLE THOMPSON,
NATASHA'S DAUGHTER,

24:52.316 --> 24:53.796
HER POLICE SKETCH
JUST CAME IN.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.319
IT LOOKS A LOT
LIKE STEPHANIE.

24:55.363 --> 24:58.105
I THINK ALL OF OUR
BOXES ARE CHECKED NOW.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.150
OK, HERE'S HER WORK
AND HER HOME ADDRESS.

25:00.194 --> 25:02.413
ROSSI: GREAT JOB,
GARCIA.

25:05.242 --> 25:08.071
OH, MY GOSH, STEPHANIE,
DID YOU HEAR?

25:09.595 --> 25:12.336
THE FBI IS HERE.
IN LEWISTON.

25:12.380 --> 25:13.990
THEY'RE LOOKING INTO THE
MURDERS AT THOSE HOUSES,

25:14.034 --> 25:15.383
AND THEY THOUGHT
I DID IT.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.602
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

25:16.645 --> 25:19.213
I DIDN'T. I MEAN, NOBODY
WE KNOW WOULD DO THAT.

25:19.256 --> 25:21.737
COURTNEY, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

25:21.781 --> 25:23.304
WE NEED YOUR HELP.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.872
HELP? REALLY?
WITH WHAT?

25:25.915 --> 25:27.526
A CASE.

25:27.569 --> 25:29.658
PATRICK AND I CLEANSED
THIS HOUSE LAST WEEK.

25:29.702 --> 25:31.225
IT DIDN'T WORK,

25:31.268 --> 25:32.574
AND WE'RE GONNA TRY AGAIN.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.097
I WANT YOU TO COME WITH.

25:34.141 --> 25:36.447
YOU'VE NEVER
ASKED ME BEFORE,

25:36.491 --> 25:38.972
BUT, OK, YES,
I WOULD LOVE TO.

25:39.015 --> 25:40.974
GREAT. LET'S GO.

25:41.017 --> 25:42.366
RIGHT NOW?
YES.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.629
BUT YOU NEED TO LEAVE
YOUR CELL PHONE HERE.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.631
THE CELL SIGNALS INTERFERE
WITH THE EMF METERS.

25:45.674 --> 25:47.720
OK. NO PROBLEM.

25:47.763 --> 25:50.070
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
PATRICK'S WAITING FOR US.

26:01.908 --> 26:02.909
AAH!

26:13.615 --> 26:14.790
IT'S CLEAR.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.968
CHECK THIS OUT.

26:23.886 --> 26:24.974
MILEY: IT'S COURTNEY'S PHONE.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.672
WHAT'S IT DOING HERE?

26:26.715 --> 26:28.151
WE KNOW THEY RUN
IN THE SAME CIRCLE.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.762
YEAH, IF COURTNEY
CAME HERE AFTER
LEAVING THE STATION

26:29.805 --> 26:31.590
LAST NIGHT, THAT
MEANS THEY MUST KNOW
EACH OTHER PRETTY WELL.

26:31.633 --> 26:34.810
NO SIGNS OF
A STRUGGLE MEANS THEIR
RELATIONSHIP'S GOOD.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.420
DOES THAT MAKE COURTNEY
AN ACCOMPLICE?

26:36.464 --> 26:39.032
NO, THE ONLY THING
SHE'S GUILTY OF
IS EXCITEMENT.

26:39.075 --> 26:40.686
IF STEPHANIE'S SAVVY,
SHE COULD HAVE TRICKED

26:40.729 --> 26:41.817
COURTNEY INTO
HER OWN ABDUCTION.

26:41.861 --> 26:43.123
WE'RE GONNA NEED
A BOLO OUT ON COURTNEY,

26:43.166 --> 26:44.646
STEPHANIE, AND PATRICK.

26:44.690 --> 26:45.821
I'LL GET MY BEST
PEOPLE ON IT.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.606
I WONDER WHAT
PATRICK'S ROLE
IS IN THIS.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.737
COULD BE A PARTNER.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.000
OK, BUT WHERE WOULD
THEY TAKE COURTNEY?

26:51.044 --> 26:54.830
I DON'T KNOW, BUT THE
ANSWER IS SOMEWHERE
IN THIS OFFICE.

27:05.275 --> 27:08.714
COURTNEY:
TOO BAD THIS PLACE
ISN'T WELL KNOWN.

27:08.757 --> 27:11.238
IT SHOULD BE LEGENDARY.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.849
70 YEARS AGO,
MRS. VAN VRAKEN

27:13.893 --> 27:16.852
MURDERED HER ENTIRE FAMILY
IN THE BEDROOM,

27:16.896 --> 27:19.725
STABBING EACH OF THEM
15 TIMES

27:19.768 --> 27:22.336
BECAUSE THEY WERE
POSSESSED BY DEMONS.

27:22.379 --> 27:24.773
SHE'S HAUNTED THE PLACE
EVER SINCE.

27:27.863 --> 27:30.257
I'M SO SORRY.
YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE STORY.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.694
BUT WHEN I GET
EXCITED, I TALK.

27:32.738 --> 27:35.305
WHEN I TALK, I DON'T
ALWAYS THINK IT THROUGH.

27:35.349 --> 27:38.569
IT'S A VICIOUS CIRCLE.

27:38.613 --> 27:40.484
IT'S OK, COURTNEY.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.573
I'M GLAD YOU'RE EXCITED.

27:45.751 --> 27:48.797
I READ A RUMOR THAT
A COUPLE BOUGHT THIS PLACE

27:48.841 --> 27:50.756
FROM THE VAN VRAKEN
ESTATE IN 1982,

27:50.799 --> 27:52.279
BUT THEY DIDN'T MAKE
IT THROUGH THE NIGHT.

27:52.322 --> 27:55.717
THE WIFE STABBED
THE HUSBAND
AND THEN HERSELF.

27:55.761 --> 27:56.979
NOBODY'S LIVED
HERE SINCE.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.459
IS THAT TRUE?

27:58.502 --> 27:59.765
IT IS.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.462
I ALSO READ THAT
AFTER THE COUPLE DIED,

28:01.505 --> 28:03.072
THE VAN VRAKEN ESTATE
BOUGHT BACK THE HOUSE

28:03.116 --> 28:06.728
AND THEY'VE BEEN
TRYING TO SELL IT
ON AND OFF FOR YEARS.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.730
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:08.774 --> 28:10.689
DID THEY ASK YOU
TO CLEANSE IT?

28:13.300 --> 28:16.564
THEY DID.

28:16.607 --> 28:19.698
THIS PLACE HAS SUCH
UNIQUE ENERGY.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.917
I CAN REALLY FEEL
THE VIBE.

28:25.834 --> 28:27.836
THERE'S ONLY ONE RULE HERE--

28:27.880 --> 28:31.535
STAY AS QUIET AS POSSIBLE.

28:31.579 --> 28:34.974
THEY CAN HEAR EVERYTHING.

28:35.017 --> 28:40.762
AND MRS. VAN VRAKEN,
SHE DIDN'T STAB HER
FAMILY 15 TIMES EACH.

28:40.806 --> 28:41.981
IT WAS 22.

28:42.024 --> 28:44.853
OHH. COOL.

28:46.115 --> 28:48.161
COME ON, PATRICK'S WAITING.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.773
THE CARTERS KEPT DETAILED
RECORDS OF THEIR INVESTIGATIONS.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.906
IT'S GONNA HELP US
PIECE TOGETHER THEIR WORK.

28:53.949 --> 28:55.821
MY TAKEAWAY IS THAT
THE CARTERS WERE STUDIOUS,

28:55.864 --> 28:57.648
PREPARED, AND LEFT
NOTHING TO CHANCE,

28:57.692 --> 28:59.781
BUT THEY WERE STILL ABLE
TO THINK ON THEIR FEET.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.786
HEY, GARCIA.

29:04.830 --> 29:06.309
GARCIA: I HAVE TRIED
TO FIND THE CARTERS

29:06.353 --> 29:09.704
THROUGH VEHICLE, CREDIT CARD,
PHONE, AND SMARTLY FOR THEM

29:09.748 --> 29:11.880
AND INFURIATINGLY FOR ME,
THEY'RE OFF THE GRID.

29:11.924 --> 29:13.795
LEWIS: WELL, MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING IN STEPHANIE'S PAST

29:13.839 --> 29:14.927
THAT CAN HELP US OUT.

29:14.970 --> 29:16.885
WELL, SHE HAD A
RELATIVELY DIFFICULT,

29:16.929 --> 29:20.759
IF NOT SADLY,
UN-UNIQUE CHILDHOOD.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.630
SHE WAS AN
OUTSTANDING STUDENT.

29:22.673 --> 29:24.197
SHE WAS BULLIED ALL THE TIME.

29:24.240 --> 29:26.852
WHEN SHE GOT TO
HIGH SCHOOL, SHE FOUGHT BACK,

29:26.895 --> 29:28.854
AND THEN GOT
EXPELLED FOR IT.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.377
I DOUBT IT GOT ANY
EASIER AFTER THAT.

29:30.420 --> 29:33.075
NO, THE EXPULSION
STARTED A DOWNWARD SPIRAL

29:33.119 --> 29:34.860
OF INTENSE PSYCHIATRIC CARE

29:34.903 --> 29:37.906
AND A SHIFTING COCKTAIL
OF VARIOUS MEDS.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.343
YET SHE STILL HELD IT
TOGETHER AND BECAME
A COLLEGE PROFESSOR.

29:40.387 --> 29:43.869
GARCIA: BUT THEN 5 YEARS
AGO, SOMETHING CHANGED

29:43.912 --> 29:45.827
'CAUSE SHE WENT OFF
ALL HER MEDS,

29:45.871 --> 29:48.351
SHE STOPPED GOING
TO THERAPY COLD TURKEY.

29:48.395 --> 29:51.398
IT'S LIKE SOMETHING
MADE EVERYTHING BETTER.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.313
LEWIS: I'M SURPRISED IT TOOK
HER THIS LONG TO BREAK DOWN.

29:53.356 --> 29:54.618
YEAH, WHITE KNUCKLING
LIKE THAT?

29:54.662 --> 29:56.142
THAT'S A BIG STRESSOR.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.839
DO WE KNOW WHY SHE
STOPPED EVERYTHING
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.362
NO, THERE'S NO RECORD OF IT.

29:59.406 --> 30:01.843
SHE DIDN'T POST
ANYTHING SPECIFIC.

30:01.887 --> 30:04.411
THE CARTERS STARTED
THEIR INVESTIGATIONS
5 YEARS AGO.

30:04.454 --> 30:07.893
THEIR FIRST JOURNAL IS HERE.

30:07.936 --> 30:12.636
AROUND THAT TIME,
STEPHANIE MET A
LIKE MIND IN PATRICK.

30:12.680 --> 30:16.989
SUDDENLY, HER ENTIRE
WORLD MADE SENSE.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.175
I NEED TO TALK
TO PATRICK FIRST.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.845
STEPHANIE, YOU'RE BACK.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.848
LOCAL P.D. JUST BROUGHT
THE LATEST BATCH

30:49.891 --> 30:52.981
OF JOURNALS AND TAPES FROM
STEPHANIE AND PATRICK'S OFFICE.

30:53.025 --> 30:55.984
AND WE KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW

30:56.028 --> 30:57.856
ABOUT STEPHANIE
AND COURTNEY,

30:57.899 --> 30:59.074
BUT WHAT ABOUT PATRICK?

30:59.118 --> 31:04.036
HE'S THE LAST UNKNOWN.
LET'S DIG INTO HIS LIFE.

31:04.079 --> 31:05.646
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

31:09.432 --> 31:12.000
I'VE GOT HIS MOST
RECENT JOURNAL RIGHT HERE.

31:12.044 --> 31:14.873
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
HE WROTE IN IT?

31:14.916 --> 31:16.178
A WEEK AGO.

31:16.222 --> 31:18.702
HE AND STEPHANIE WERE
ABOUT TO START A NEW CASE.

31:18.746 --> 31:22.010
HIS PRELIMINARY NOTES
SAY HOW EXCITED HE WAS.

31:22.054 --> 31:25.666
UH, THAT THEY'D SEEN
A LOT IN THE PAST,

31:25.709 --> 31:27.581
BUT HE THOUGHT
THAT THIS HOUSE

31:27.624 --> 31:28.974
MIGHT BE THEIR
MOST DANGEROUS ONE YET.

31:29.017 --> 31:30.540
DID THEY FINISH
THAT CASE?

31:30.584 --> 31:32.803
NO.

31:32.847 --> 31:35.981
NO, HIS NOTES ARE INCOMPLETE,
WHICH IS STRANGE

31:36.024 --> 31:38.418
BECAUSE EVERY OTHER ONE
OF THEIR CASES WAS
METHODICALLY DETAILED

31:38.461 --> 31:40.159
BEGINNING TO END,
NO EXCEPTIONS.

31:40.202 --> 31:42.552
SO THIS CASE WAS
DIFFERENT FOR A REASON.

31:42.596 --> 31:45.686
YEAH, IT LOOKS LIKE PATRICK
WASN'T AROUND TO FINISH IT.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.775
WE NEED AN ADDRESS
ON THAT HOUSE.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.125
GOT ONE RIGHT HERE.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.009
YOU'VE BEEN GONE
A LONG TIME.

32:04.052 --> 32:07.664
IS EVERYTHING OK?

32:07.708 --> 32:10.885
I RAN INTO COURTNEY.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.800
YOU DID?

32:12.843 --> 32:14.976
I BROUGHT HER HERE.

32:15.020 --> 32:17.152
HOW COME?

32:28.033 --> 32:30.905
COURTNEY WAS AT THE LAST
HOUSE AND CAUGHT
THE INFECTION THERE.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.385
REALLY?

32:32.428 --> 32:33.864
YES.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.170
IT'S IN THE EARLY STAGES,

32:35.214 --> 32:36.650
BUT I COULD SEE IT
IN HER EYES.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.613
THE INFECTION IS
MOVING FASTER NOW.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.224
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT
COURTNEY HERE.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.577
IF I SAVE HER
WHILE IN THIS HOUSE,

32:50.620 --> 32:52.492
I CAN STOP
THE SPREAD FOREVER.

32:52.535 --> 32:54.624
HOW MUCH LONGER DO YOU
THINK WE HAVE BEFORE--

32:57.932 --> 33:00.195
IT'S TOO LATE.

33:00.239 --> 33:03.024
SHE'S FULLY INFECTED.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.462
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU
HAVE TO DO.

33:06.506 --> 33:09.944
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
TO SAVE HER.

33:15.558 --> 33:17.169
COURTNEY: STEPHANIE?

33:18.431 --> 33:20.085
WHERE'S PATRICK?

33:27.135 --> 33:29.181
ISN'T THIS PATRICK'S STUFF?

33:30.747 --> 33:31.792
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:31.835 --> 33:33.054
STEPHANIE! AAH!

33:33.098 --> 33:34.403
STEPHANIE!

33:36.405 --> 33:38.103
PATRICK.

33:57.600 --> 33:58.688
UHH!

34:04.129 --> 34:05.869
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

34:05.913 --> 34:08.872
BUT I HAVE NO CHOICE.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.048
AAH!

34:24.062 --> 34:25.324
UHH!

34:39.033 --> 34:41.079
AAH!

34:51.654 --> 34:54.048
COURTNEY: PLEASE, NO.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.006
STEPHANIE.

34:56.050 --> 34:58.139
THEY'RE GETTING STRONGER.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.706
THEY HAVEN'T FOUGHT BACK
THIS MUCH BEFORE.

34:59.749 --> 35:01.577
I'M NOT WHAT YOU
THINK I AM.

35:01.621 --> 35:03.971
I'M--I'M NOT.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.147
THAT'S WHAT
THEY ALWAYS SAY.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.148
STEPHANIE, PLEASE.

35:07.192 --> 35:09.237
DO WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO, STEPHANIE,

35:09.281 --> 35:12.066
JUST LIKE
YOU DID TO ME.

35:13.198 --> 35:15.548
COURTNEY: PLEASE, NO.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.941
IT'S OK, COURTNEY.

35:17.985 --> 35:20.161
I'M GOING TO SAVE YOU.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.425
AAH!

35:24.600 --> 35:26.167
COURTNEY.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.954
ROSSI: COURTNEY.

35:30.998 --> 35:32.565
AGENT ROSSI?

35:32.608 --> 35:35.045
YEAH. IT'S ME.
I'M HERE, KID.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.177
I GOT YOU.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.004
YOU'RE GONNA BE OK.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.928
CAN I GET A SECOND
WITH HER, PLEASE?

35:53.412 --> 35:56.197
CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

35:57.807 --> 36:00.158
I'VE BEEN CHASING
STORIES LIKE THIS

36:00.201 --> 36:02.856
FOR A LONG TIME.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.424
TODAY, I ALMOST
BECAME ONE OF THEM.

36:07.034 --> 36:10.385
MAYBE IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

36:10.429 --> 36:12.561
NO.

36:12.605 --> 36:14.998
A BELIEF
AS STRONG AS YOURS,

36:15.042 --> 36:17.175
THAT'S UNSHAKEABLE.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.220
IT'S BORN FOR A REASON.

36:21.527 --> 36:23.485
MY GUESS IS

36:23.529 --> 36:26.053
THAT YOU LOST SOMEBODY.

36:30.492 --> 36:32.929
MY TWIN SISTER.

36:34.540 --> 36:37.717
WE WERE 8.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.763
IT WAS A CAR ACCIDENT.

36:42.504 --> 36:45.290
SO NOW YOU BELIEVE
BECAUSE IT GIVES YOU HOPE

36:45.333 --> 36:47.205
THAT YOU'LL SEE HER AGAIN.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.077
YES.

36:52.688 --> 36:55.517
THAT'S A POWERFUL
FEELING.

36:55.561 --> 37:00.130
DON'T YOU EVER
GIVE IT UP. OK?

37:00.174 --> 37:01.784
OK.

37:06.485 --> 37:11.359
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE
IN WHAT I DO, AGENT ROSSI,

37:11.403 --> 37:14.754
BUT I'VE SEEN THINGS.

37:14.797 --> 37:19.280
AND RIGHT NOW I CAN SEE THAT
YOU'RE HAUNTED BY SOMETHING.

37:25.330 --> 37:27.593
YOU TAKE CARE OF
YOURSELF, COURTNEY.

37:29.072 --> 37:31.553
YOU, TOO.

37:31.597 --> 37:34.252
AND THANKS.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.276
YOU WERE GREAT
TODAY WITH COURTNEY.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.234
AND I HOPE THAT'S
FURTHER PROOF

38:00.278 --> 38:02.323
YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO DOUBT YOURSELF.

38:02.367 --> 38:05.152
YOU'RE A CORNERSTONE
OF THIS TEAM, DAVE.

38:05.195 --> 38:08.721
THANKS.
I APPRECIATE IT.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.940
AND THE DRINK, TOO.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.075
WE WILL GET
EVERETT LYNCH,
I PROMISE.

38:15.118 --> 38:17.164
I KNOW.

38:17.207 --> 38:20.210
WE JUST HAVE TO
TRUST THE PROCESS.

38:20.254 --> 38:24.084
COME ON, YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE ACCUSED
OF DRINKING ALONE.

38:25.215 --> 38:27.217
ALVEZ: I'LL ASK HIM.
ROSSI?

38:27.261 --> 38:29.176
YOU THINK
THE BAU's HAUNTED?

38:29.219 --> 38:31.091
YEP, 100%.

38:31.134 --> 38:32.527
OH.LEWIS: COME ON.

38:32.571 --> 38:33.920
DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?

38:33.963 --> 38:35.313
ROSSI: WELL, NOTHING
THAT COULD BE USED AS
EVIDENCE

38:35.356 --> 38:36.836
IN A COURT OF LAW.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.272
ALVEZ: NO, I'VE FELT IT, TOO.

38:38.316 --> 38:41.275
I MEAN, I'M TALKING ABOUT
SUDDEN DROPS IN TEMPERATURE

38:41.319 --> 38:44.409
OR UNEXPLAINED SOUNDS,
THINGS LIKE THAT.

38:44.452 --> 38:48.630
JAREAU: JEEZ, NEXT YOU'RE
GONNA SAY YOU FOUND TRACES
OF ECTOPLASM IN THE FRIDGE.

38:48.674 --> 38:51.285
ROSSI: I THINK THAT WAS
REID'S LEFT OVER
CURRY NOODLE SOUP.

38:53.156 --> 38:55.594
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I DO FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING WATCHED.

38:55.637 --> 38:57.900
AND I MEAN, I KNOW
NOBODY'S THERE,

38:57.944 --> 38:59.685
BUT I CAN FEEL
EYES ON ME.

38:59.728 --> 39:02.209
EMILY, NOT YOU, TOO.

39:02.252 --> 39:03.950
WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
A BELIEVER, JJ?

39:03.993 --> 39:05.343
NOPE. NOT EVEN A LITTLE.

39:05.386 --> 39:08.128
OH, THAT'S MY GIRL.MM-HMM.

39:08.171 --> 39:09.608
SAME HERE. EVEN AS A KID
AROUND THE CAMPFIRE,

39:09.651 --> 39:12.567
I WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO
PULL LOGIC THREADS.

39:12.611 --> 39:14.569
YOUR BUDDIES MUST
HAVE LOVED THAT.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.746
PRENTISS:
HOW CAN THE THREE OF
YOU BE SO SKEPTICAL

39:17.790 --> 39:19.182
AFTER WHAT WE'VE SEEN?

39:19.226 --> 39:20.358
LEWIS: SEE,
THAT'S MY POINT.

39:20.401 --> 39:21.924
HOW CAN I BELIEVE IN
THAT STUFF

39:21.968 --> 39:23.578
AFTER WE'VE SEEN
WHAT WE'VE SEEN?

39:23.622 --> 39:25.232
I MEAN, YEAH,
MONSTERS ARE REAL,

39:25.275 --> 39:27.452
BUT THEY ARE
MOST DEFINITELY HUMAN.

39:27.495 --> 39:31.412
ROSSI: AND YOU MOST
DEFINITELY HAVE A LOOSE
DEFINITION FOR "HUMAN,"

39:31.456 --> 39:34.763
BECAUSE MONSTERS ARE
MONSTERS IN MY BOOK.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.810
ROSSI, VOICE-OVER: "HOW DOES
ONE KILL FEAR, I WONDER?

39:37.853 --> 39:40.421
"HOW DO YOU SHOOT A SPECTER
THROUGH THE HEART,

39:40.465 --> 39:42.945
"SLASH OFF ITS
SPECTRAL HEAD,

TAKE IT BY ITS
SPECTRAL THROAT?"
