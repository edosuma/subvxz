01:14.933 --> 01:16.483
Long ago,

01:16.950 --> 01:21.042
humans and Dragons lived
in perfect harmony.

01:22.291 --> 01:26.542
But the humans became greedy,
and began to take over the world,

01:26.708 --> 01:30.250
consuming everything in their path.

01:30.417 --> 01:32.958
The Dragons pleaded with the humans,

01:33.125 --> 01:35.750
to stop this selfish quest.

01:35.917 --> 01:39.625
But, instead of listening,
the humans declared war.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.667
An evil alchemist, Petrucius,

01:43.833 --> 01:48.667
created a Dragon-killing monster,
and named it Nettlebrand.

01:48.833 --> 01:52.208
But, Petrucius could not
control the monster,

01:52.375 --> 01:56.458
and was killed by his own creation.

01:56.708 --> 02:01.042
Nettlebrand began hunting the
Dragons all over the world.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.875
The Dragons scattered helplessly, unable

02:05.042 --> 02:08.500
to counter Nettlebrand's
immunity to their fire.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.517
After losing their tracks,

02:12.583 --> 02:15.392
Nettlebrand retreated to
his creator's castle,

02:15.458 --> 02:18.667
obsessed with his desire to devour.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.542
Centuries passed.

02:22.708 --> 02:25.025
The humans took over the world,

02:25.192 --> 02:27.832
forgetting all about special creatures.

02:28.999 --> 02:32.583
The remaining Dragons had
no choice but to hide,

02:32.750 --> 02:36.542
keeping their existence a secret
from the rest of the world.

02:36.708 --> 02:39.958
But nothing remains hidden forever.

03:19.292 --> 03:23.958
At Christmas people get our trees.

03:24.125 --> 03:27.958
Get out of their way and
don't try to drive them away.

03:28.125 --> 03:31.292
We're going to get into
trouble for this.

03:31.458 --> 03:34.992
Hide any evidence of our presence.

03:35.458 --> 03:36.875
Get up here, you big lump.

03:40.742 --> 03:43.942
And remember,
fire is the last resort.

03:44.292 --> 03:46.567
It should be used for protection only.

03:46.833 --> 03:50.583
Order! Order!
Let's have some order here.

03:50.750 --> 03:53.133
Listen up.
This is a serious matter.

03:53.600 --> 03:57.558
Fire is a weapon, not
a toy! No fire, no fly...

04:01.250 --> 04:05.292
- Firedrake?
- I'm sorry. My bad.

04:05.458 --> 04:08.233
- Hi.
- What're you doing up there?

04:08.500 --> 04:09.933
- I - I just...
- Spare me the details.

04:10.300 --> 04:13.608
Don't you have anything better
to do, than creeping around?

04:14.375 --> 04:15.520
Like what?

04:15.720 --> 04:18.820
Well, we've got loads
to do here. Like, er..

04:18.850 --> 04:21.500
Guessing what shape
the next cloud'll be...

04:21.666 --> 04:25.375
- Taking a good mud bath.
- Flicking flies with your tail.

04:25.542 --> 04:28.047
No-ones saying you
can't have fun.

04:28.247 --> 04:30.847
Just keep it quiet, you two.

04:30.858 --> 04:34.833
I want to be a proper Dragon, like
the Dragons in Slatebeard's stories.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.917
Oh, give me strength.

04:37.083 --> 04:41.017
Stay out of trouble. Stay out of sight!
That's an order!

04:43.375 --> 04:45.583
Where's the fun in hiding
all the time?

04:45.750 --> 04:48.858
Bottleneck doesn't allow
us to do anything.

04:49.125 --> 04:52.242
But we're safe here.
Isn't that more important?

04:52.708 --> 04:56.333
Who can hurt us?
Sprites? Gnomes?

04:56.500 --> 04:59.717
My mum will, if I'm not
home for dinner!

05:01.783 --> 05:03.208
See you tomorrow.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.408
Slatebeard!

05:24.583 --> 05:27.808
Feast your eyes on this, ladies.

05:30.958 --> 05:35.458
Funny hooks.
He thinks he's a real Dragon.

05:35.625 --> 05:38.250
- What's his name?
- Spinecrackle.

05:38.417 --> 05:42.533
Spinecrackle? That's a name
I won't forget in a hurry.

05:43.000 --> 05:45.292
He's not a <i>real</i> Dragon..

05:45.458 --> 05:49.792
The Rim Of Heaven, that's where
the <i>real</i> Dragons live..

05:49.958 --> 05:54.017
Hey Slatebeard! You telling your
crazy tales again, old man?

05:54.583 --> 05:58.458
Old man?
I'll give you old man!

05:58.625 --> 06:02.708
He's got a nerve.
What's his name?

06:02.875 --> 06:05.458
You were saying - the Rim Of Heaven?

06:06.167 --> 06:08.408
How do you know of the
Rim Of Heaven?

06:08.875 --> 06:12.683
- Uh, you just said it?
- Have you been there?

06:15.750 --> 06:19.750
Ooh, that Dragon is so annoying.
What's his name?

06:19.917 --> 06:23.500
- Tell me more about the Rim Of Heaven.
- Ahh, yes.

06:23.667 --> 06:29.542
A paradise, for Dragons,
where the moonflowers shine.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.917
Where is it?

06:33.708 --> 06:35.375
It's err... Uhh...

06:35.833 --> 06:37.333
It's...?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.958
In a far away mountain range.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.333
No, Slatebeard. Don't nap now.

06:43.500 --> 06:45.217
On the other side of the world.

06:49.792 --> 06:52.458
Paradise for Dragons.

06:53.833 --> 06:55.650
Where is this place?

06:56.417 --> 07:00.408
He said it was in a far away mountain
range, on the other side of the world.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.283
He called it, Paradise For Dragons.

07:06.042 --> 07:10.083
A Paradise For Dragons.
That's good for you, then.

07:10.292 --> 07:12.167
Oh, brownies are welcome too.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.042
How do you know?

07:14.208 --> 07:17.042
Maybe they barbecue
brownies there.

07:17.208 --> 07:18.217
Nice.

07:21.333 --> 07:25.108
All I'm saying, is it sounds
like my kind of place.

07:25.875 --> 07:29.500
My dad says the world outside
of this valley is a scarey place.

07:30.167 --> 07:32.225
Well, we're stuck here.

07:43.042 --> 07:44.183
Humans!

07:46.792 --> 07:48.808
We have to tell the others.

07:55.217 --> 07:56.600
Calm down.

07:56.650 --> 07:58.050
The humans are coming.

07:58.250 --> 07:59.792
What will they do when they find us?

07:59.958 --> 08:04.208
What they always do when they want
something. Attack first, ask questions later.

08:04.375 --> 08:06.575
It wasn't always like this.

08:07.042 --> 08:09.500
Back in the days of the
Great Dragon King,

08:09.667 --> 08:13.858
humans and Dragons even
flew together.

08:13.925 --> 08:14.742
Right...

08:14.808 --> 08:18.042
Until the humans wanted to
have it all their own way.

08:18.208 --> 08:21.550
We lay low, and wait for
the humans to pass us by.

08:22.117 --> 08:26.667
I say we take the fight to the enemy.
It's about time we show them who's boss!

08:26.833 --> 08:29.500
We are noble creatures.
Fighting is not our way.

08:29.667 --> 08:33.457
- What's so noble about hiding?
- Enough!

08:33.625 --> 08:35.390
If the humans advance
further in this direction,

08:35.590 --> 08:37.511
they'll be on us by the
next full moon.

08:37.812 --> 08:39.582
- Sulfurbreath!
- Yes Boss?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.417
Prepare the hideout.

08:43.067 --> 08:45.467
What about the Rim Of Heaven?
We could go there.

08:45.917 --> 08:48.333
Yeah, right! How're you
planning to get there?

08:48.583 --> 08:50.667
- I've got wings, haven't I?
- Seriously?

08:50.833 --> 08:54.167
We find the Rim Of Heaven, come back,
and lead everyone to safety.

08:54.333 --> 08:57.167
That's insane. You've never
been outside the valley.

08:57.217 --> 08:58.208
Sorrell!

08:59.458 --> 09:00.592
I'm coming, mum!

09:11.791 --> 09:15.400
There we go. This should keep
us going for the forseeable.

09:15.666 --> 09:19.707
Those <i>awful</i> humans,
think the world belongs to them!

09:19.957 --> 09:23.083
It's like I've always told
you - they're the worst!

09:23.250 --> 09:26.558
We should run away! Leave the
valley! Find a new home!

09:27.625 --> 09:30.958
My dear Sorrell, if I knew of
somewhere we could go,

09:31.125 --> 09:32.617
we'd be out of here in a jiffy.

09:57.042 --> 09:59.775
I'll come back. I promise.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.167
Alright.

10:21.333 --> 10:24.042
Sorrell!
What're you doing here?

10:24.208 --> 10:28.317
What do you think. Come on!
Before I change my mind.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.875
Okay.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.625
Here we go.

10:32.792 --> 10:36.667
I hope you know what you're doing.
You've never flown before!

11:02.333 --> 11:04.767
So, genius: where do we start?

11:10.083 --> 11:13.333
- Sorrell! Are you alright?
- Still alive.

11:16.292 --> 11:18.375
Wow, look at that!

11:19.708 --> 11:22.467
What <i>is</i> that?
It looks amazing.

11:22.667 --> 11:24.546
Should we go down there?

11:25.083 --> 11:27.458
Are you crazy?
That's where the humans live.

11:28.708 --> 11:31.458
- Even though...
- What?

11:31.625 --> 11:35.080
A pixy I know once told me
about this all knowing

11:35.180 --> 11:36.733
oracle that lives there.

11:37.617 --> 11:39.833
Maybe it can help us find
the Rim Of Heaven.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.425
Great. What's it called?

11:42.792 --> 11:45.667
They call it <i>The Internet</i>.

11:46.333 --> 11:50.508
The Internet?
Okay, let's go ask The Internet.

11:50.958 --> 11:54.417
Oh, I guess we don't really
have a better choice.

11:55.042 --> 11:59.125
Nope, nope. It is way to dangerous
to go flying down there.

11:59.375 --> 12:02.292
Come on, Sorrell.
We gotta try.

12:17.583 --> 12:19.292
Hey!

12:19.458 --> 12:23.000
Hey! You won't get away this time!

12:23.667 --> 12:26.167
Watch out!

12:27.333 --> 12:30.917
He ran into my car!
Now I have a dent!

12:43.167 --> 12:44.800
Stop thief!

12:48.500 --> 12:51.708
Hey, watch it!
Here, check it out.

12:51.875 --> 12:55.500
- Here! That's him!
- Stop, Police!

12:58.125 --> 12:59.625
Yeah.

13:00.375 --> 13:02.167
Oww.

13:02.333 --> 13:03.950
Ugh.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.004
That's my costume. What d'you
think you're doing?

13:12.750 --> 13:15.375
Oh, oh, oh.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.542
Ooh.

13:18.708 --> 13:19.750
Sorry.

13:20.458 --> 13:24.792
Okay. I'm the little brown thing,
you're the giant wingy thing.

13:24.958 --> 13:27.308
I go find The Internet,
you hide in there.

13:29.125 --> 13:30.250
Okay.

13:39.875 --> 13:41.125
Hello?

13:55.292 --> 13:58.833
Back in the days of the
great Dragon kings,

13:59.000 --> 14:03.375
humans and Dragons even
flew together.

14:23.250 --> 14:24.625
Hmm.

14:35.808 --> 14:38.458
Yeah, yeah. Very good.
Very good.

14:38.525 --> 14:41.333
That my friend, is a pretty
awesome costume.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.475
You're with the movie, right?

14:44.042 --> 14:45.925
Come on little guy,
where are you?

14:48.833 --> 14:52.808
Kinda... feels... Dragony.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.917
Oh.

14:55.542 --> 14:59.083
Okay now. Stay cool.
It's just a Dragon.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.083
Hi.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.592
A talking Dragon!

15:06.792 --> 15:08.392
- Oh, you're him!
- Huh?

15:09.458 --> 15:12.000
Yeah. I'm, er, him.

15:12.167 --> 15:15.858
I'm a Dragon Rider?

15:16.208 --> 15:18.833
A Dragon Rider.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.083
- What's a Dragon Rider?
- Ahh... It's...

15:21.250 --> 15:24.650
like a Horse Whisperer.
But with Dragons!

15:24.917 --> 15:26.575
It's a psychic thing.

15:26.625 --> 15:30.225
That's amazing. Can you help us
find the Rim Of Heaven?

15:30.792 --> 15:33.915
Maybe I should check my diary.
This is a very busy time,

15:34.015 --> 15:35.508
in the Dragon Rider calendar.

15:35.808 --> 15:39.133
I looked all over, and I couldn't find...
Ahh! A human!

15:39.183 --> 15:40.542
Stay back!

15:40.708 --> 15:42.399
What'd I tell you about
mingling with the enemy?

15:42.599 --> 15:45.099
No, no. You don't understand.

15:45.117 --> 15:48.417
He's a Dragon Rider. He can
help us find the Rim Of Heaven.

15:48.583 --> 15:53.167
Puhlease! Don't fall for his tricks.
The human is a liar and a cheat!

15:53.333 --> 15:56.125
- How do you know that?
- All humans are liars and cheats!

15:56.175 --> 15:57.125
They're the worst.

15:57.325 --> 15:59.761
But this one's different.
He has special talents.

15:59.825 --> 16:03.167
- Talents? What talents?
- I can, read your mind?

16:03.417 --> 16:07.792
Then you'll know what I'm thinking.
He's not coming with us.

16:08.333 --> 16:11.875
Ah! So, how about we find
that Thing Of Heaven?

16:12.125 --> 16:15.125
You betcha. Climb aboard, Dragon Rider.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.483
No! No!
I am not flying with a human.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.892
- Ahh... We need to move fast!
- Sorrell, come on!

16:28.042 --> 16:29.500
Okay.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.400
Steady everyone.
Sounds like this is the one.

16:43.292 --> 16:45.008
Gotta fly!

16:52.908 --> 16:55.200
That should be us up there!

16:55.300 --> 17:00.083
I know a free ride when I see a
free ride, and <i>he</i> is a free ride!

17:00.150 --> 17:02.750
You don't like humans, do you?

17:02.917 --> 17:06.467
- You've probably never even met one.
- No, and I wouldn't want to.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.142
Well, where's the sense in that?

17:08.407 --> 17:10.767
So, where to next, Dragon Rider?

17:11.333 --> 17:14.556
All we know is the Rim Of Heaven
is in a far away mountain range

17:14.633 --> 17:19.291
- on the side of the world.
- A far away mountain range...

17:19.458 --> 17:21.717
On the other side of the world?

17:21.782 --> 17:26.083
- Hey! Hey, Dragon! Put me down!
- But we've just taken off.

17:26.250 --> 17:30.350
That's quite far enough. Besides,
you've got a great setup here.

17:30.417 --> 17:31.604
Go with the chipmunk.

17:31.804 --> 17:34.924
I'm not a chipmunk!
I'm a Forest Brownie.

17:35.250 --> 17:38.917
Yes, awesome. Come on scales,
let's fly down nice and easy.

17:39.167 --> 17:43.292
- You said you can help us.
- Oh? No, no. Not me, wrong guy.

17:47.958 --> 17:51.458
Goodbye. Or should I say,
until we meet again?

17:51.708 --> 17:53.092
It's goodbye.

17:53.958 --> 17:56.067
Let us know if you change
your mind.

17:56.333 --> 17:59.275
- Good riddance.
- Ooh.

18:00.500 --> 18:02.600
This place is spine tingling.

18:03.167 --> 18:06.842
Look at my spines.
They're literally tingling.

18:07.292 --> 18:11.083
Dragons? Brownies?
What the heck is going on?

18:11.250 --> 18:16.167
- My head is itching insanely.
- My back. All the time.

18:16.332 --> 18:19.333
But it's not your back up there,
Stonebeard.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.500
I could scratch that.

18:21.750 --> 18:24.750
- Someone's coming.
- Whoah! Hey...

18:24.916 --> 18:26.317
Get your fat butt out of sight.

18:28.083 --> 18:32.417
You want some of this?
I am so ready to strike.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.708
Halt right there! Who are you?

18:35.875 --> 18:39.708
We are three dwarves. This is Stonebeard,
this is Gravelbeard.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.458
And I'm Graniteface.

18:41.625 --> 18:43.292
Overjoyed to meet you.

18:43.958 --> 18:47.375
- There must be some around here.
- I'll take a look back there.

18:47.625 --> 18:50.417
My scalp didn't prickle so
much last time I saw...

18:50.583 --> 18:54.125
Ooh! Is that what I think it is?

18:54.292 --> 18:58.033
- A Dragon!
- A silver Dragon.

18:58.500 --> 19:03.150
We haven't seen one of these around
these parts since... Never.

19:03.500 --> 19:07.125
Och, what a joy to behold!

19:07.292 --> 19:09.008
He certainly is.

19:09.375 --> 19:13.958
Oh, jings. Kribbens. I left my flask of
cheeky water at the mine.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.792
- Carry on without me.
- And off he goes.

19:17.958 --> 19:19.542
Disgraceful manners.

19:21.208 --> 19:25.375
- Where travel you to, Dragon?
- We seek the Rim Of Heaven.

19:25.542 --> 19:26.758
Firedrake!

19:26.825 --> 19:28.917
The Rim Of Heaven, you say?

19:29.083 --> 19:32.542
Where east meets west,
the story says.

19:32.708 --> 19:35.333
Did you know,
according to legend:

19:35.500 --> 19:38.333
the day the Rim Of Heaven
is discovered,

19:38.500 --> 19:41.250
silver will be worth more
than gold.

19:42.083 --> 19:45.333
Silver! Gold!
I'll never have to steal again!

19:45.583 --> 19:48.015
We're not interested in
silver or gold,

19:48.215 --> 19:50.102
we just need to find a way
to get there.

19:50.402 --> 19:51.958
As you say.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.033
Anyway. This coal needs a
good warm fire.

19:55.500 --> 19:58.500
Good luck with your quest.
You don't see that every day.

19:58.750 --> 20:02.042
That's it!
We follow the rising sun...

20:02.208 --> 20:04.958
- 'Til east meets west.
- Dragon Rider!

20:05.058 --> 20:06.158
Oh, no!

20:06.208 --> 20:09.667
- You're coming with us?
- All the way to the Ding Of Heaven.

20:14.417 --> 20:18.333
You're a fake! You're a phony!
You're not a Dragon Rider!

20:18.583 --> 20:20.583
Guys. Guys, guys.

20:20.750 --> 20:23.458
If I'm not a Dragon Rider,
what d'you call this!

20:23.625 --> 20:25.667
My Dragon Rider card.

20:27.508 --> 20:28.508
Oops.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.750
- Was that...
- My pants, yes.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.917
I rest my case. You wouldn't know a
Dragon if it burnt a hole in your sock.

20:36.083 --> 20:40.125
I most certainly would.
This is definitely a male Dragon.

20:40.375 --> 20:44.100
- You are a male Dragon, right?
- You're not coming with us!

20:44.150 --> 20:47.083
I'm warning you, don't make
me use my Dragon Rider powers!

20:47.250 --> 20:49.900
What powers?
You don't have any powers.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.667
Oh, you're going to love this!

21:12.667 --> 21:15.083
- Twigleg!
- Yes Master?

21:16.542 --> 21:20.167
Do something, you puny Humunkulus!

21:20.333 --> 21:22.375
I'm bored out of my mind.

21:22.542 --> 21:25.500
Have you heard of something
called Fetch a Match.com?

21:25.667 --> 21:28.583
- What?
- Fetch a Match.com.

21:28.750 --> 21:32.708
Your chance to find love,
or a meal. Or both.

21:32.875 --> 21:36.458
Are you wasting my time,
you worthless slave?

21:36.708 --> 21:40.833
No Master. We just need your profile.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.292
About me?

21:46.542 --> 21:49.083
It's to tell them who you are.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.000
Oh, that's easy:

21:51.167 --> 21:53.458
Five hundred year-old Dragonoid...

21:53.708 --> 21:57.542
Violent! Vicious!
Ate his creator!

21:59.492 --> 22:02.208
Ahh... Perhaps a little finessing.

22:02.375 --> 22:03.667
What about:

22:03.833 --> 22:07.083
mature, sensitive type with
healthy appetite?

22:07.250 --> 22:09.417
Fine. Let's go with that.

22:09.583 --> 22:14.167
Would like to meet like-minded,
for fun and frolics, and...

22:14.333 --> 22:16.083
- Fun?
- I said, fun!

22:16.250 --> 22:19.250
Pay attention, stick-man,
or I'll do for you as I did

22:19.317 --> 22:21.667
for your eleven brothers and sisters!

22:23.917 --> 22:28.125
Dislikes: not eating Dragons.

22:28.375 --> 22:32.583
Likes: eating Dragons.
Oh, and golf.

22:32.750 --> 22:36.417
And feeling the soft summer
breeze on my face.

22:36.583 --> 22:38.333
And eating Dragons!

22:39.383 --> 22:40.892
A quick picture...

22:41.458 --> 22:45.708
Shall we enhance, Master?

22:48.125 --> 22:51.333
- How do I look?
- Like a weird savage freak.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.583
Which is not what you are.

22:54.750 --> 22:59.125
Okay. Lets hope those victims,
I mean, matches, come flooding in!

22:59.375 --> 23:01.125
Yay, Nettlebrand!

23:01.375 --> 23:03.375
Have I got news for you!

23:03.625 --> 23:04.792
News?

23:05.042 --> 23:08.417
Up on the hill, I just saw...
Have a guess.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.208
Do I have to?

23:11.275 --> 23:14.583
- Umm... A shooting star.
- Oh, we can do better than that.

23:14.833 --> 23:16.875
Umm... A sheep.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.458
A rainbow?

23:18.508 --> 23:21.167
- Tell me!
- I'll give you a clue.

23:21.667 --> 23:25.692
Harrr! Harrrr!

23:26.417 --> 23:28.042
What is that?

23:28.208 --> 23:30.125
- An opera singer.
- What?

23:30.292 --> 23:34.125
Do me a favour.
It's only a ripe, juicy, Dragon!

23:34.375 --> 23:35.667
A Dragon?

23:35.917 --> 23:39.625
Not just any Dragon.
A silver Dragon!

23:39.792 --> 23:41.833
And the ball's in the back
of the net!

23:42.000 --> 23:46.250
A silver Dragon. I have never
heard of a silver Dragon.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.750
I yearn for a silver Dragon.

23:48.917 --> 23:51.417
I hunger for a silver Dragon.

23:51.583 --> 23:53.625
Show me this silver Dragon!

23:53.875 --> 23:56.250
Now you're talking my language!

24:05.958 --> 24:10.083
Sorry about that. I've got youngest
brownie syndrome.

24:11.333 --> 24:12.708
No hard feelings?

24:16.792 --> 24:19.042
No hard feelings.

24:26.417 --> 24:28.500
Oh... Over there.

24:29.875 --> 24:32.583
I can see the silver Dragon.

24:36.250 --> 24:38.875
Ahh... Guys?

24:43.167 --> 24:45.458
Where's the Dragon Rider?

24:45.708 --> 24:48.000
- He took off.
- What?

24:48.250 --> 24:52.625
Yep. I guess he chickened out
Now it's back to you and me.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.750
Woah!

24:56.708 --> 24:59.792
Dragon Rider! Hi.

25:00.625 --> 25:04.542
- Never expected this.
- She pushed me off the mountain!

25:06.208 --> 25:08.708
I can smell the silver Dragon.

25:12.417 --> 25:14.417
Let's get outta here.

25:17.125 --> 25:18.792
Woohoo!

25:22.792 --> 25:24.917
I can taste all.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.958
Huh? Where's he gone?

25:34.792 --> 25:38.875
My roar, your roar.
Look at us both! We're both roaring!

25:39.042 --> 25:43.042
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
I must know where they're going.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.708
Raven!

25:47.417 --> 25:50.875
- Go after them!
- But, Master...

25:51.042 --> 25:53.332
I've lived in your cellar
for five hundred years.

25:53.432 --> 25:55.485
I know nothing of the
world beyond.

25:55.833 --> 25:58.542
How will I communicate with you?

25:58.708 --> 26:00.033
Skype me.

26:03.208 --> 26:05.125
That just leaves you and me.

26:05.292 --> 26:07.867
Two merciless giants of nature.

26:08.333 --> 26:11.625
What d'you say? Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

26:11.792 --> 26:15.750
I'm thinking, I'm in urgent
need of a new slave.

26:15.917 --> 26:20.425
Let's not say slave.
Let's say... Partner.

26:28.292 --> 26:29.542
Sorrell?

26:31.042 --> 26:32.808
Firedrake?

26:34.292 --> 26:36.333
Where are you, lad?

26:37.333 --> 26:40.167
Did you find him?

26:40.333 --> 26:42.875
Right! You two, stop it, now!

26:43.042 --> 26:44.292
Sorry.

26:44.958 --> 26:46.183
Oh!

26:49.050 --> 26:51.550
My baby girl. She's missing!

27:02.875 --> 27:07.150
Okay, so how about a
fire-breathing demo?

27:07.750 --> 27:09.625
Ahh...

27:09.792 --> 27:13.558
We're not allowed to play around with that.
Fire is a weapon. Not a toy.

27:13.625 --> 27:15.958
Come on. There's no-one here.

27:16.208 --> 27:19.583
- Ahh... Ahh...
- Hmm?

27:19.833 --> 27:22.250
Okay.

27:22.500 --> 27:23.600
Here we go.

27:28.792 --> 27:31.625
This isn't good. This isn't good at all.

27:31.875 --> 27:33.608
Don't worry, Sorrell.

27:33.875 --> 27:36.242
We've got the Dragon Rider to
guide us through all this.

27:36.708 --> 27:38.833
Ahh... Right.

27:57.958 --> 28:01.375
I feel... Woozy.

28:30.458 --> 28:31.542
Huh?

28:36.625 --> 28:38.250
Hello?

28:48.125 --> 28:51.250
Hah! Nice hair!

28:58.208 --> 28:59.583
Ah. Got it.

29:01.833 --> 29:05.783
- Where's Firedrake?
- I was going to ask you the same thing.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.958
- Oh.
- Hey! Wait!

29:39.875 --> 29:42.533
What am I doing here?

29:45.417 --> 29:46.450
Firedrake!

29:50.917 --> 29:52.558
He's still breathing.

29:54.542 --> 29:56.292
Wow.

29:59.250 --> 30:02.208
I'm... going to wait outside.

30:04.750 --> 30:07.083
- What is that?
- I don't know.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.700
And I don't want to know. All sorts of
things are attracted to Dragons.

30:17.833 --> 30:20.792
Emergency call on line one!

30:21.042 --> 30:23.925
- Dragon Rider?
- Yeah.

30:26.542 --> 30:29.650
You can't scare us!
We've got a Dragon!

30:31.517 --> 30:32.871
Go on scales.

30:33.071 --> 30:34.375
- Torch him!
- Okay.

30:36.458 --> 30:38.125
Err... not good!

30:38.375 --> 30:40.708
- He can't breathe fire.
- What?

30:59.750 --> 31:02.675
Do something. Anything!

31:09.292 --> 31:10.500
Hey!

31:21.125 --> 31:23.583
Good boy. Good boy, easy.

31:23.833 --> 31:27.333
It's a good thing I was around. Who knows
what would have happened, otherwise.

31:29.542 --> 31:33.042
Allow me to introduce myself.
My name is Professor Barnabus Greenbloom.

31:33.208 --> 31:34.708
You've killed him!

31:34.875 --> 31:39.500
Typical human! Setting upon
a poor defenceless... Thing.

31:39.750 --> 31:42.500
No, he's not dead,
he's simply stunned.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.175
He'll be out for a week or so,
but he'll be alright.

31:45.225 --> 31:48.208
Look at him!
He's definitely dead!

31:52.500 --> 31:54.292
Woah! A silver Dragon!

31:55.000 --> 31:56.417
Exceptional.

31:56.583 --> 32:00.500
Oh, he's exceptional, alright.
He can't breathe fire.

32:00.750 --> 32:02.500
Oh.

32:04.042 --> 32:06.750
What've you done? Firedrake!

32:06.917 --> 32:08.608
This Dragon is one of a kind.

32:08.675 --> 32:10.708
- We better go find him.
- Great.

32:12.500 --> 32:13.900
Firedrake, where are you?

32:16.167 --> 32:17.633
Here Dragon, Dragon!

32:19.125 --> 32:20.967
He didn't mean it!

32:21.017 --> 32:22.083
Aha.

32:23.167 --> 32:24.683
That stupid...

32:38.042 --> 32:39.250
So...

32:39.417 --> 32:42.658
How come no show in
the flame department?

32:43.125 --> 32:45.858
I open my mouth,
but nothing ever happens.

32:46.625 --> 32:49.625
The other Dragons call me Lameflame.

32:49.792 --> 32:51.167
Ouch.

32:51.333 --> 32:55.250
What's the point of being a Dragon,
if you can't breathe fire?

32:55.417 --> 32:56.758
Other Dragons?

32:57.125 --> 32:58.625
I'm such a fake.

32:58.792 --> 33:00.338
I'm not what I seem to be at all.

33:00.617 --> 33:02.593
You wouldn't understand.

33:04.667 --> 33:07.208
Firedrake!

33:07.375 --> 33:10.750
Yeah, we should get back
to the others.

33:10.917 --> 33:14.992
Give me a second chance, Dragon Rider.
I have to find the Rim Of Heaven.

33:15.042 --> 33:17.583
What's the big fuss about
the Rim Of Heaven?

33:17.750 --> 33:20.175
It's the only place that
we can be safe.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.708
Humans are destroying our valley, so...

33:22.875 --> 33:26.600
I promised to find it and return
before the next full moon.

33:27.167 --> 33:28.625
No pressure, huh.

33:28.692 --> 33:29.292
Listen.

33:29.292 --> 33:32.583
Humans do bad things,
but good things too.

33:32.750 --> 33:34.917
Not all humans are bad.

33:35.083 --> 33:37.750
You're a good human, right?

33:39.208 --> 33:40.375
Ahh...

33:40.542 --> 33:41.792
Right.

33:42.500 --> 33:46.500
- So... You're still gonna help us?
- Well...

33:46.667 --> 33:49.542
I've come this far, haven't I?

33:49.792 --> 33:54.042
Oh, thankyou! Thankyou, thankyou!
I won't let you down again.

33:54.292 --> 33:55.875
Ah, there you are.

33:56.042 --> 33:58.094
Right. Let's head back to my
camp and get some rest.

33:58.294 --> 33:59.594
You've been through a lot.

34:00.625 --> 34:02.367
Heck of a long way, mate.

34:05.208 --> 34:08.833
- By the way - thanks.
- Hm?

34:09.083 --> 34:10.246
Back there, in the ruin.

34:10.447 --> 34:14.409
You weren't a chipmunk.
You were a tiger.

34:17.083 --> 34:18.125
Hm.

34:24.917 --> 34:27.833
So. Where are you heading to?

34:28.083 --> 34:32.500
We're flying to the Rim Of Heaven,
or at least we were, before I crashed.

34:32.667 --> 34:34.333
Oh, no no. You crashed

34:34.500 --> 34:37.958
because you were effected by the presence
of another rare special creature.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.042
It wasn't your fault.

34:40.708 --> 34:43.167
That nasty chicken-thing in the cave?

34:43.333 --> 34:46.400
The Basilisk is a rare and
beautiful specimen.

34:46.467 --> 34:48.833
Maybe only twenty of
its kind in the world.

34:49.000 --> 34:50.708
I'm taking him to my reserve,

34:50.909 --> 34:53.174
where he'll get all the care and
attention he needs.

34:59.333 --> 35:01.750
- Gross!
- He likes you.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.135
I run the reserve with my
wife and daughter.

35:04.335 --> 35:05.384
She's about your age.

35:06.625 --> 35:08.719
We hope to collect, catalogue
and cultivate

35:08.919 --> 35:11.812
every rare and special
creature on the planet.

35:15.667 --> 35:18.542
I came for a basilisk..ha ha.

35:18.708 --> 35:22.417
And I found a silver Dragon!

35:23.667 --> 35:28.167
Ooh! That tickles.
As I thought. Hmm.

35:28.417 --> 35:31.325
Oh, oh. Now be very careful
with that one.

35:32.292 --> 35:35.167
- What's in it?
- Well, that's my tea.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.933
Right. You seek the Rim Of Heaven.

35:39.500 --> 35:43.442
Now. If I'm not mistaken,
it should lie somewhere in the Himalayas.

35:43.708 --> 35:47.292
But, even my friend, the famous
Dracologist, Subisha Gulab,

35:47.542 --> 35:49.458
doesn't know exactly where it is.

35:49.524 --> 35:52.625
And she knows everything there
is to know about Dragons.

35:53.833 --> 35:56.183
Hey wait a minute.
I know who you can ask.

35:56.383 --> 35:58.212
The Djinn with a thousand eyes.

35:58.750 --> 36:01.125
He lives in the ravine... Here.

36:01.375 --> 36:02.800
Oh.

36:02.850 --> 36:05.833
He has the power to answer
any question in the world.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.974
But be warned. He's got some
rather anti-social habits.

36:09.542 --> 36:11.708
Now, your route will be perilous.

36:11.875 --> 36:14.758
So, whatever you do,
avoid the Angry Giant.

36:15.208 --> 36:18.292
Somewhere around here.
Maybe here.

36:18.458 --> 36:21.542
And the Nasty Elves.
And the Sea Serpent.

36:21.792 --> 36:23.125
Is that all?

36:23.374 --> 36:27.582
And the Roc Bird in the mountains here.
Beware these three things.

36:27.833 --> 36:31.375
- That's four things, idiot!
- Hm?

36:40.917 --> 36:42.375
Hm?

36:43.583 --> 36:46.908
- Anything else?
- Get some rest.

36:46.958 --> 36:51.625
You can stay here tonight. I'll get you
supplies for your journey in the morning.

37:13.583 --> 37:16.942
I think you might need something
a little more comfortable.

37:17.292 --> 37:21.400
Now, it may lack the comfort of home,
but it's better than sleeping rough.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.292
It's okay.

37:24.542 --> 37:26.208
Go on.

37:45.958 --> 37:47.958
I forgot to say...

37:48.125 --> 37:50.167
There's some fresh
clothes if you...

38:18.500 --> 38:20.908
'Couple killed in car crash...'

38:23.508 --> 38:24.545
Hmm...

38:31.345 --> 38:33.931
Are you a fan of prison movies?

38:34.458 --> 38:38.308
Huh? Fetch a Match.com!

38:38.375 --> 38:40.458
You have a sensitive side!

38:41.658 --> 38:46.600
Nothing to be ashamed of.
Let me give you a little word of advice.

38:47.167 --> 38:50.883
- If you're looking for some loving...
- Oh no you don't!

38:53.167 --> 38:56.167
Feed 'em mean, keep 'em keen,
They love that.

38:57.733 --> 38:58.808
Twigleg!

38:58.958 --> 39:03.125
I know where the Dragon is going.
A place called the Rim Of Heaven.

39:03.192 --> 39:04.683
The Rim Of Heaven!

39:04.750 --> 39:07.400
This is better than I imagined.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.621
First, they must seek out
the Thousand Eyed Djinn.

39:10.121 --> 39:13.042
No! No! The Djinn will destroy them!
Stay with them!

39:13.208 --> 39:17.167
But the Raven has deserted me, Master.
How can I follow them?

39:17.333 --> 39:21.167
You'll think of something.
I must follow them to the Djinn.

39:21.417 --> 39:24.375
Ooh, this's getting more
evil by the minute.

39:24.625 --> 39:28.958
So, we haven't actually worked
out the terms of the partnership.

39:29.125 --> 39:32.275
You're my slave. Those are the terms.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.125
The Super Submersible.

39:38.333 --> 39:40.792
What a beauty!

39:40.958 --> 39:42.917
What's a submersible?

39:43.167 --> 39:45.250
My ticket to anywhere in the world.

39:45.417 --> 39:48.367
It was built by the human
who made me

39:48.433 --> 39:50.550
and that wretched Twigling.

39:57.375 --> 39:58.867
What are you doing?

39:58.933 --> 40:01.667
We're partners.
Where you go, I go.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.492
Oh no.

40:23.208 --> 40:24.492
Where is it?

40:25.042 --> 40:27.725
- Hi. Got a moment?
- Huh?

40:27.792 --> 40:29.450
Help me load him onto the Jeep.

40:30.500 --> 40:34.867
So, should I call you Dragon Rider,
or do you have another name?

40:38.208 --> 40:40.250
I've got a female on the reservation.

40:40.917 --> 40:42.925
I'm hoping they'll start a family.

40:45.125 --> 40:46.217
You got a family?

40:47.083 --> 40:48.675
You must be a long way from home.

40:50.708 --> 40:53.358
I do fine on my own.

40:55.333 --> 40:58.250
Oh. By the way,
does this belong to you?

41:00.500 --> 41:02.142
D'you like crosswords?

41:02.708 --> 41:04.275
Yeah...

41:05.917 --> 41:09.583
You know, I could do with a
little help, on the reservation.

41:10.250 --> 41:11.275
Here.

41:11.625 --> 41:14.358
If you're ever in my part
of the world, you can look me up.

41:14.525 --> 41:17.308
My wife and daughter would
be delighted to meet you.

41:19.875 --> 41:22.833
Accept the past, and move on.

41:23.500 --> 41:24.517
What?

41:25.167 --> 41:27.833
Closure. Six down.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.650
It's... Ben.

41:36.917 --> 41:39.625
My name is Ben.

41:41.542 --> 41:43.708
Okay, Ben.

41:45.292 --> 41:47.908
You're always welcome.

41:59.667 --> 42:02.408
Next stop - the Mighty Djinn.

42:02.875 --> 42:05.808
Good luck. Let me know if you
find the Rim Of Heaven.

42:06.875 --> 42:08.792
Thankyou Professor. We will.

42:11.125 --> 42:13.808
Goodbye, Professor.
And... Thanks.

42:14.875 --> 42:16.250
Alright, Scales.

42:16.417 --> 42:19.450
You handle the flying,
I'll do the navigating.

42:21.708 --> 42:23.333
Good flight.

44:12.292 --> 44:15.692
That was the worst excuse for
navigation I have ever seen!

44:15.842 --> 44:19.575
Come on. It wasn't that bad.
At least we avoided that Roc Bird.

44:20.542 --> 44:24.667
- Oh, come on! Give me a break.
- Sorrell, hold on!

44:38.542 --> 44:41.042
Hold on, Sorrell!

44:56.083 --> 44:57.583
Keep going.

45:04.750 --> 45:08.792
Firedrake! Help!

45:12.167 --> 45:13.708
Wow!

45:17.583 --> 45:20.250
No, no, no, no! Nooo!

45:23.375 --> 45:25.500
Gotcha!

45:32.208 --> 45:34.575
Sorrell, are you alright?

45:35.042 --> 45:37.792
I'm okay. That was intense!

45:37.958 --> 45:40.283
You really had me worried
there for a second.

45:41.250 --> 45:42.775
You did it!

45:43.542 --> 45:46.625
- What.
- You breathed fire!

45:46.875 --> 45:49.875
- For real.
- A blue flame! Didn't you see?

45:50.042 --> 45:51.417
It was awesome!

45:53.067 --> 45:54.583
I did it.

45:55.958 --> 45:57.983
- I did it!
- Woohoo!

45:58.750 --> 46:02.208
- I did it! I did it! I did it!
- For real, Firedrake!

46:02.458 --> 46:05.683
- All thanks to you, Dragon Rider!
- Oh, come on.

46:05.783 --> 46:06.783
Oh, man.

46:06.833 --> 46:08.286
- Did you see that?
- That was incredible!

46:08.486 --> 46:12.692
- I didn't realize I was doing it!
- I'm so proud!

46:12.892 --> 46:15.862
Out of my mouth, and set on fire!

46:15.862 --> 46:17.162
- Incredible!
- I can't believe it.

46:17.250 --> 46:22.333
- Just spit fire for a moment...
- Sensational, a stroke of genius...

46:26.750 --> 46:28.850
Hey. Look at this.

46:41.000 --> 46:42.867
The Djinn's ravine.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.708
What fresh Hell is this?

47:39.208 --> 47:40.708
Huh?

47:43.792 --> 47:45.525
Any sign of that Djinn?

47:46.792 --> 47:47.992
Honk me?

47:50.125 --> 47:51.625
What!

48:03.833 --> 48:07.725
You have a question for the Mighty Djinn?

48:08.292 --> 48:11.958
Ask me anything you wish.
But, I warn you:

48:12.208 --> 48:15.667
if it is a question I have
heard before...

48:20.708 --> 48:23.292
Ask your question!

48:23.542 --> 48:24.783
You heard what the Djinn said:

48:24.850 --> 48:28.283
if it's a question he's heard before,
he's gonna zap another tree.

48:29.750 --> 48:32.208
We have to ask the Djinn
where the Rim Of Heaven is.

48:32.375 --> 48:34.235
I'm pretty sure he'll have
heard that before.

48:34.335 --> 48:36.329
It's a chance we have to take.

48:36.629 --> 48:39.142
- Leave this with me.
- No! No...

48:40.292 --> 48:42.767
- Where is the Rim Of Heaven?
- Not!

48:43.333 --> 48:44.525
What?

48:44.875 --> 48:48.475
Where is the Rim Of Heaven... Not?

48:48.625 --> 48:51.292
What kind of question is that?

48:51.458 --> 48:54.492
You want to know where it isn't?

48:54.658 --> 48:56.583
Ahh... Yeah.

48:56.833 --> 49:00.125
Pole to pole, north and south?

49:00.292 --> 49:02.608
And everywhere in between?

49:02.958 --> 49:04.917
Yeah, right!

49:05.083 --> 49:08.375
Every blade of grass,
every stone,

49:08.625 --> 49:12.550
every grain of sand,
every place the Rim Of Heaven isn't!

49:13.000 --> 49:17.292
That will take an eternity.
I cannot do it.

49:17.542 --> 49:21.617
Then answer the question
as you know it! You owe us that!

49:27.708 --> 49:29.333
Ahh.

49:48.792 --> 49:50.417
Oh no.

49:50.583 --> 49:53.625
Do you have another question
for the Mighty Djinn?

49:53.875 --> 49:57.067
- Yeah. How do we get out of here?
- Fools!

49:57.333 --> 50:01.208
A question I have heard
many times before!

50:01.375 --> 50:02.966
Sorrell! What've you done?

50:03.066 --> 50:06.504
No-one escapes the Djinn alive!

50:07.292 --> 50:08.583
Dragon Rider!

50:15.792 --> 50:18.250
You just messed with the
wrong Dragon!

50:18.417 --> 50:19.767
I'll show you fire!

50:22.500 --> 50:23.567
Not again.

50:31.125 --> 50:34.833
- Silver Dragon.
- What the...

50:35.083 --> 50:37.700
Oh, you're in the big
league now, son!

50:47.750 --> 50:49.683
I don't get it.
Why isn't it working?

50:49.833 --> 50:54.250
- The Dragon Rider. It all makes sense.
- What're you talking about?

50:54.500 --> 50:57.130
I can only breathe fire when the
Dragon Rider is sitting on my back.

50:57.230 --> 50:59.830
That's crazy!
What makes you think...

50:59.875 --> 51:01.417
Look out!

51:09.792 --> 51:11.175
He's indestructible.

51:14.417 --> 51:15.933
Let's get him out of there.

51:16.583 --> 51:18.875
Firedrake!

51:29.083 --> 51:32.417
Dragon Rider, come back to us.

51:32.583 --> 51:34.417
- Ba, ba, ba.
- What's wrong with him?

51:34.583 --> 51:35.733
I don't know.

51:36.000 --> 51:38.517
- I kind of like him better this way.
- You're the Dragon Rider.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.892
Oh, this's all my fault.

51:43.042 --> 51:46.667
This has nothing to do with you.
He's been trouble since the beginning.

51:46.833 --> 51:49.250
I say we leave him here and
forget we ever met him.

51:49.500 --> 51:52.942
Are you out of your mind?
We can't desert the Dragon Rider.

51:53.708 --> 51:55.658
You really have to stop
being so judgmental.

51:56.125 --> 51:59.583
Pumpkins?
I don't have any pumpkins.

52:02.583 --> 52:04.450
Okay. Okay.

52:04.500 --> 52:06.750
What're we gonna do?

52:07.000 --> 52:09.542
Go away, Dragon!

52:11.667 --> 52:15.225
This must be where the
Professor's friend lives.

52:15.792 --> 52:18.583
I can't believe I'm actually
saying this, but...

52:18.750 --> 52:21.375
Maybe she'd be able to help us.

52:21.542 --> 52:23.392
Sorrell, you're a genius!

52:23.958 --> 52:25.125
We'll see about that.

52:25.792 --> 52:26.933
By the way...

52:28.000 --> 52:30.367
Way too much Djinn.

52:33.583 --> 52:37.792
That Djinn'll know better than
to mess with us next time.

52:37.958 --> 52:41.583
Listen to me.
If you don't stop talking...

52:41.833 --> 52:45.667
Ahh, don't be so modest.
It's not like I could ever work alone.

52:45.833 --> 52:49.375
So, where to next, partner?
Some more butt kicking?

52:49.542 --> 52:53.833
We wait until that pathetic
insect Twigleg reports back.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.675
Och! I hate waiting.

52:55.742 --> 52:59.883
Hey! What about that dating thing?
Got any hits, lover boy?

53:00.250 --> 53:03.233
I once dated a three-headed
Cerberus. Know she had six...

53:28.333 --> 53:32.167
Firedrake? Sorrell!

53:33.667 --> 53:37.625
Firedrake! Sorrell!

53:39.958 --> 53:43.925
You know what I think?
The humans have taken them.

53:44.875 --> 53:47.900
The concrete slabs have
to go over there.

53:52.792 --> 53:55.083
You still want to hide, Bottleneck?

53:56.708 --> 53:59.342
Those humans have gone too far.

54:00.208 --> 54:02.167
This means...

54:02.333 --> 54:03.450
War!

54:25.375 --> 54:27.167
Where are we?

54:27.375 --> 54:29.642
Dragon Rider, you're back.

54:31.292 --> 54:33.333
Hut. Hut, hut, hut, hut, hut.

54:35.625 --> 54:37.142
Who are you?

54:37.708 --> 54:42.125
Hello. My name is Firedrake, this is
Sorrell, and this here's the Dragon Rider.

54:43.542 --> 54:46.292
You are Bravatnar-Gobi-Payanakarmi?

54:46.542 --> 54:48.125
I'm... What?

54:48.875 --> 54:50.500
The Dragon Rider.

54:50.667 --> 54:53.850
Bravatnar-Gobi-Payanakarmi
has returned!

54:54.542 --> 54:57.250
Can we just stick to Dragon Rider?

54:57.500 --> 54:59.992
- Take my carrots!
- You must use my potatoes!

55:00.058 --> 55:01.300
My pants! My pants!

55:01.467 --> 55:05.417
Do you want to offend the
Dragon Rider with your offerings?

55:07.792 --> 55:11.533
We're looking for the Dracologist,
Subisha Gulab.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.542
Put him in the special
Bravatnar-Gobi-Payanakarmi chair!

55:16.183 --> 55:18.275
Come this way. Come, come!
This way! This way!

55:21.333 --> 55:22.833
What?

55:23.083 --> 55:25.925
The Dragon Rider is back!

55:27.375 --> 55:30.667
This doesn't make any sense.
I made it all up.

55:31.742 --> 55:36.333
Subisha! Subisha!
You will never believe this.

55:36.500 --> 55:41.175
Be still, Deepak! How many times do I
have to tell you not to shout so much?

55:42.125 --> 55:43.958
Can this be true?

55:45.375 --> 55:49.042
The Dragon Rider has
returned! Look!

55:49.208 --> 55:52.083
I found him. It's me. I did.

55:52.292 --> 55:54.133
Who are you, boy?

55:54.958 --> 55:57.208
Err... The Dragon Rider?

55:58.917 --> 56:01.783
Professor Greenbloom
told us about you.

56:02.250 --> 56:03.992
We were hoping you could help us?

56:05.625 --> 56:09.250
Of course! Come with me.
This way. Come, come, come!

56:10.000 --> 56:13.833
Only three thousand steps. Hurry up.
Pick your feet up.

56:14.000 --> 56:16.792
I do this every day.
I don't work out.

56:16.958 --> 56:20.475
I don't need to work out.
Not with a physique like this.

56:23.875 --> 56:27.583
Welcome to the Temple of
the Dragon Rider.

56:27.750 --> 56:30.375
What is your business here?

56:30.542 --> 56:31.992
We seek the Rim Of Heaven.

56:33.042 --> 56:34.625
No-one knows where it is.

56:34.792 --> 56:38.517
It's hidden from the world,
protected by powerful magic.

56:39.583 --> 56:41.633
Is there anything more
you can tell us?

56:42.083 --> 56:45.250
This Temple is the resting
place of Varin,

56:45.417 --> 56:49.250
the only human ever
to ride a Dragon.

56:49.417 --> 56:53.917
Varin led the Dragons to the Rim Of
Heaven when they were in retreat.

56:54.083 --> 56:56.542
He sealed them there with a special key,

56:56.608 --> 56:59.200
keeping them safe inside.

56:59.550 --> 57:01.900
The monster we saw in the ravine!

57:02.850 --> 57:04.867
Varin ventured to find other Dragons.

57:04.933 --> 57:06.846
But the monster tracked
him down,

57:06.946 --> 57:09.545
savaged him,
and stole the key.

57:10.133 --> 57:13.000
As he lay dying, he set
down this prophecy...

57:13.250 --> 57:15.567
Papadum. Samosa. Who's hungry?

57:15.917 --> 57:18.010
Deepak! Now's not the time for
treats and refreshments!

57:18.110 --> 57:20.010
I'm trying to be mystical.

57:20.167 --> 57:23.583
They have flown halfway around the world,
and need something to eat.

57:23.750 --> 57:25.833
Look at the Dragon Rider.
He's famished, okay?

57:26.083 --> 57:29.083
Leave it here, Deepak. I will
finish telling the story first.

57:29.133 --> 57:30.558
You can't tell me what to do.

57:30.625 --> 57:32.371
I will leave the treats and
refreshments here,

57:32.571 --> 57:35.298
and let you get all mystical
of my own free will!

57:35.598 --> 57:37.708
- Shut your mouth.
- Bla, bla, bla.

57:37.958 --> 57:41.125
- Always the same music.
- You go too far.

57:41.292 --> 57:44.375
- We have guests.
- I warn you. Go away!

57:45.792 --> 57:47.292
Forgive my husband.

57:47.458 --> 57:50.725
He is a good man, but he's
also a pain in the patootie.

57:51.292 --> 57:53.700
Where were we? Ah, yes.

57:54.167 --> 57:55.792
The Prophecy.

57:55.958 --> 57:59.392
'The day the Rim Of Heaven
is discovered,

57:59.458 --> 58:02.750
silver will be worth more
than gold.'

58:02.917 --> 58:05.458
Just what the dwarves said
on the mountain.

58:05.625 --> 58:08.542
Many have searched...

58:08.708 --> 58:11.308
By the way, there is still
Rajma Chawal and Mag ni Daal.

58:12.375 --> 58:13.667
Can you smell it... Spicy.

58:14.333 --> 58:17.750
- Ooh. Too strong. Too strong.
- I'm not done yet, you idiot!

58:18.000 --> 58:19.708
Always take so long telling
the back story.

58:19.875 --> 58:23.333
The Dragons were locked away, nobody
knows where they are, job done!

58:23.583 --> 58:25.825
Go away, Deepak!
Just go!

58:25.892 --> 58:27.450
Okay, I'll go away.
I'll eat it myself.

58:28.917 --> 58:30.708
It was an arranged marriage.

58:31.792 --> 58:35.483
Many have searched, but no-one
has found the Rim Of Heaven.

58:35.750 --> 58:37.750
Are there still Dragons in
the Rim Of Heaven?

58:38.417 --> 58:40.817
I have no reason to
believe otherwise.

58:41.167 --> 58:44.383
This monster, does he have a name?

58:44.833 --> 58:48.300
They call the monster Nettlebrand!

58:55.625 --> 58:58.333
- Put me down! Put me down!
- Who are you?

58:58.500 --> 59:01.267
- My name is Twigleg.
- What're you doing here?

59:01.917 --> 59:03.117
I...

59:03.167 --> 59:06.257
You know what we do with spies?
We scratch their eyes out!

59:06.257 --> 59:08.832
I mean you no harm. I didn't
want to be Nettlebrands's spy.

59:09.817 --> 59:10.479
What?

59:10.479 --> 59:13.079
You've been spying for
this monster, Nettlebrand?

59:13.167 --> 59:14.667
I say we get rid of him.

59:14.833 --> 59:17.750
No! Please. Spare me.
I hate being a spy.

59:17.917 --> 59:22.292
I'm terrible with secrets.
I find it all so stressful.

59:22.542 --> 59:24.292
What does Nettlebrand want?

59:24.542 --> 59:27.267
He means for you to lead
him to the Rim Of Heaven.

59:27.833 --> 59:29.883
- You're going to pay for this!
- No. No.

59:29.950 --> 59:30.400
I can help you!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.921
How can you help us,
wretched little man?

59:33.321 --> 59:35.875
It's him.

59:36.042 --> 59:38.775
- My Master, Nettlebrand.
- Now what?

59:39.625 --> 59:42.500
If I prove my worth,
will you let me live?

59:42.667 --> 59:44.042
How can you do that?

59:44.792 --> 59:47.717
I'll throw him off the scent.
Send him on a wild goose chase!

59:48.583 --> 59:52.167
Okay. One chance, but slip up,
and it's the end for you.

59:52.417 --> 59:54.625
Master!

59:54.875 --> 59:56.917
Twigleg. What've you been doing?

59:57.083 --> 59:59.675
Oh, Master,
I'm going to tell you everything!

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:02.750
We're almost at the
Rim Of Heaven.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:06.317
- Where is it? Tell me!
- It's in... Err...

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:09.258
The North Pole!
We're on our way there as I speak.

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.250
Why the North Pole?

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.000
Because...

01:00:13.167 --> 01:00:16.625
Because... it's at the top of the world.

01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:19.133
It makes sense when you
think about it.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.625
So far away?

01:00:21.792 --> 01:00:25.333
Oh, yes. It will still take us
many days to get there.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:27.958
Perhaps as many as...

01:00:28.208 --> 01:00:32.342
Umm, err... Eighteen days.

01:00:32.708 --> 01:00:34.442
Eighteen days?

01:00:34.708 --> 01:00:38.167
Yes. Which is why you must hurry.
You have no time to lose.

01:00:38.417 --> 01:00:40.600
Where are you now?

01:00:41.167 --> 01:00:42.833
In...

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:44.667
an igloo.

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:47.508
Surprisingly good work, Twigleg.

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:50.500
I'll travel to the North Pole
right away.

01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:54.425
Thankyou, Master. I'll meet
you in eighteen days time.

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:57.125
Eighteen days. Until then.

01:00:57.292 --> 01:01:00.667
Bani Boliye, Aloi Gibdi,
sweet and salty, Masala...

01:01:00.917 --> 01:01:02.183
I'll clean it up. I'm okay.

01:01:02.350 --> 01:01:06.333
Who is that? Varin!
You are in India!

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.875
You lied to me! You'll pay for
this, Twigleg! You traitor!

01:01:10.925 --> 01:01:13.375
He knows we're here.
We must escape at once!

01:01:13.625 --> 01:01:14.746
I'm not afraid.

01:01:14.746 --> 01:01:17.007
You should be! You have no
chance against him!

01:01:17.417 --> 01:01:20.708
You must find the Rim Of Heaven
before he finds you.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:22.042
But we still don't know
where to look.

01:01:22.292 --> 01:01:25.375
Dragon Rider. What did you
see in the Djinn's eyes?

01:01:25.542 --> 01:01:30.083
- I don't... I don't remember.
- Oh, come on! Think hard!

01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:33.625
Maybe I can help.
Come here, my child.

01:01:41.292 --> 01:01:45.042
Get your filthy hands off
my... Sorry 'bout that!

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:56.167
They think they can make
a fool out of me.

01:01:56.333 --> 01:01:57.500
Raven!

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:13.108
I see a mountain,
shaped like a crescent.

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:16.550
The Crown Peak! Quickly!
Quickly! Bring me your map.

01:02:17.883 --> 01:02:18.883
Here.

01:02:19.083 --> 01:02:22.542
This is the mountain.
You must contimue your search there.

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:25.917
- We'll head there right away.
- Whatever you do...

01:02:26.083 --> 01:02:28.700
This map must not
fall into enemy hands.

01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:32.292
Brilliant.

01:02:35.708 --> 01:02:39.125
The Raven will take the
map to Nettlebrand!

01:02:39.292 --> 01:02:41.023
How're we going to find our way
without the map?

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:43.808
And what about the key?
Where are we supposed to get that?

01:02:44.125 --> 01:02:45.494
We will find a way.

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:48.721
The Dragons who live there are in
danger now, because of us.

01:02:49.021 --> 01:02:50.967
The Crown Peak is in that direction.

01:02:51.233 --> 01:02:53.395
The Dragon Rider will
show you the way.

01:02:53.495 --> 01:02:55.995
But, I... Don't know.

01:02:56.042 --> 01:02:58.375
You are much more than
you think you are.

01:02:58.625 --> 01:03:00.933
Follow your heart, and the
truth will come to you.

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:04.700
Now hurry. The fate of the
Dragons lies in your hands.

01:03:05.667 --> 01:03:09.858
First, for the Dragon Rider.
Eat them. The mountains will be cold.

01:03:12.667 --> 01:03:16.025
Get the Dragon to the Rim Of Heaven,
grab the gold and silver...

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.786
Then forget about all this madness.

01:03:18.186 --> 01:03:20.852
Are you going to leave me here?

01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:24.158
If Nettlebrand catches me,
he'll kill me.

01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:27.934
He does know Nettlebrand
better than anyone.

01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.512
I say, we take him with us.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:33.150
I was afraid you were
going to say that.

01:03:33.417 --> 01:03:35.175
You can ride up top, little guy.

01:03:40.375 --> 01:03:43.125
I will pray for your safe return.

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:48.208
Good luck!

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:54.458
- They're going to beach party.
- Yep.

01:04:12.167 --> 01:04:13.950
Gather the troops.

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:26.642
- Which way?
- I... I... I don't know.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:30.875
Try hard, Dragon Rider.
We believe in you.

01:04:40.292 --> 01:04:41.600
Over there!

01:05:03.333 --> 01:05:04.767
We've got to go through there.

01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:09.833
Really?

01:05:25.042 --> 01:05:26.100
That way!

01:05:34.467 --> 01:05:35.467
Look...

01:05:35.667 --> 01:05:37.100
Where are we?

01:05:40.042 --> 01:05:42.375
Better to be in here,
than out there.

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.458
All good in there?

01:05:55.750 --> 01:05:57.458
Up there.

01:06:10.042 --> 01:06:13.958
- It's Nettlebrand! He's here!
- What? Are you sure?

01:06:14.750 --> 01:06:16.417
Go left!

01:06:17.042 --> 01:06:19.342
I could've sworn I saw...

01:06:23.458 --> 01:06:24.600
Right!

01:06:32.292 --> 01:06:33.917
Left! Right!

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:37.233
Left!

01:06:39.533 --> 01:06:40.730
Right!

01:06:41.542 --> 01:06:43.317
Come on! Faster!

01:06:43.517 --> 01:06:45.017
Go left!

01:06:45.283 --> 01:06:46.850
Jump right!

01:06:58.950 --> 01:07:00.207
Oh, boy!

01:07:31.875 --> 01:07:33.750
We're close.

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:46.292
Down there!

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:57.883
We made it.

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:01.717
Well, I'll be damned.

01:08:07.208 --> 01:08:11.225
I doubted you, but you
actually got us here.

01:08:11.792 --> 01:08:13.442
Well done, Dragon Rider.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.707
Oh, hey. And...

01:08:17.875 --> 01:08:20.442
Sorry I pushed you
off that mountain.

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:22.591
That's alright.

01:08:22.957 --> 01:08:25.858
What's waiting behind that door,
is <i>way</i> more important.

01:08:34.082 --> 01:08:36.457
Alright. Come on.

01:08:36.625 --> 01:08:38.292
Ready...

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.875
Wow.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:58.200
What is this place?

01:09:04.332 --> 01:09:06.582
Where's the Dragon Paradise?

01:09:14.917 --> 01:09:17.625
Is this the Rim Of Heaven?

01:09:18.274 --> 01:09:20.508
Where to now, Dragon Rider?

01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:23.667
I... I don't know.

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:26.158
This place is all I've seen
in the vision.

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:30.108
We've come so far.
This can't be it!

01:09:34.292 --> 01:09:35.917
This is the Rim Of Heaven?

01:09:36.017 --> 01:09:38.303
A bunch of drawings in a cave?

01:09:38.707 --> 01:09:40.667
Come on. Come on!

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:43.542
There must be more. Dragon Rider,
is there something we're missing?

01:09:44.207 --> 01:09:47.075
It's just a stupid old story!

01:09:57.833 --> 01:09:59.583
Come on, we need to go!

01:09:59.750 --> 01:10:03.292
I'm not leaving. Not until we
find the Rim Of Heaven.

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:06.550
It doesn't exist! Get it?
We've got to get out of here!

01:10:06.917 --> 01:10:07.976
We can't just give up.

01:10:08.076 --> 01:10:11.776
Fine. If you want to stay here
and face that freak, go ahead.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.958
- I'm gone!
- You can't just leave!

01:10:14.125 --> 01:10:15.625
Watch me!

01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:18.017
Dragon Rider?

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:21.342
Sorry, Scales.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.375
Should've just stayed in the city.

01:10:36.542 --> 01:10:39.383
Dragon Rider.
What was I thinking?

01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:43.408
- Master?
- I'm not your Master.

01:10:43.475 --> 01:10:47.208
I'm my own Master! Yeah!
And I do pretty fine on my own!

01:11:04.750 --> 01:11:07.500
I know that smell.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.467
That is eau de Humunkulus.

01:11:13.208 --> 01:11:14.483
Look at that!

01:11:18.042 --> 01:11:19.917
Almost there.

01:11:36.208 --> 01:11:37.607
The Prophecy!

01:11:40.208 --> 01:11:43.833
It's like my dad said:
'Never, ever, trust a human.'

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:47.567
You're right Sorrell.
You were right all along.

01:11:47.833 --> 01:11:49.566
I should've listened to you.

01:11:49.633 --> 01:11:53.625
Come out and shine, Silver Dragon.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:55.625
I know you're here somewhere.

01:11:55.992 --> 01:12:00.350
Oh no! Quick! We've got to
find another way out.

01:12:00.917 --> 01:12:02.791
No more running!

01:12:03.042 --> 01:12:04.192
Huh?

01:12:04.242 --> 01:12:06.683
I'm gonna stay, and fight in
the name of all Dragons!

01:12:06.783 --> 01:12:08.283
Once and for all!

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:15.833
Oh Silver Dragon, you have no idea

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
how long I've been waiting.

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.542
I'm here, Nettlebrand.

01:12:43.708 --> 01:12:45.350
It's, the big one!

01:12:53.583 --> 01:12:56.491
You're no match for me.

01:12:56.957 --> 01:12:58.458
Or me!

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:02.258
If you want to get to him,
you have to go through me, first!

01:13:03.958 --> 01:13:05.783
Firedrake, run!

01:13:11.792 --> 01:13:14.600
Is that all you've got?

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:21.458
I wonder what you taste like,
Silver Dragon!

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:35.133
Now that's a close shave.

01:13:39.625 --> 01:13:43.125
- Sorrell!
- What're you doing here, traitor?

01:13:43.292 --> 01:13:45.713
- I figured it out.
- Dragon Rider?

01:13:45.813 --> 01:13:46.713
The Prophecy!

01:13:46.808 --> 01:13:51.358
'When the Rim Of Heaven is discovered,
silver will be worth more than gold!'

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:54.983
He's gold, you're silver!
You can beat this guy!

01:13:55.033 --> 01:13:56.883
- How?
- Good point. Err...

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.750
You're a Dragon! Use your fire!

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.125
I can't.

01:14:02.292 --> 01:14:05.758
He thinks he can only breathe fire
when you're sitting on his back.

01:14:05.867 --> 01:14:09.375
- What? That's nonsense!
- I know! I was trying to tell him.

01:14:09.542 --> 01:14:12.167
Hey! Scales! You don't need me

01:14:12.417 --> 01:14:14.042
- to breathe fire!
- Huh?

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.183
Let him go!

01:14:22.375 --> 01:14:23.408
No!

01:14:35.625 --> 01:14:37.208
Well, well.

01:14:37.375 --> 01:14:41.108
You will make a tasty appetizer, human.

01:14:43.750 --> 01:14:46.458
Would you please excuse
me for one moment?

01:14:46.708 --> 01:14:48.992
Oh, my.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:51.333
Brandelina?

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:56.550
Yesss.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:59.200
You don't need me
to breathe fire!

01:14:59.350 --> 01:15:01.500
- Yes I do.
- Sorrell was right.

01:15:01.667 --> 01:15:05.783
I'm a fake. I'm a phony. I came along
because I wanted to be rich.

01:15:06.250 --> 01:15:08.792
- You can breathe fire all by yourself!
- No.

01:15:09.042 --> 01:15:13.000
Listen to me! My name is Ben!
I'm not a Dragon Rider!

01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:16.133
I'm just some kid off the street!
I lied to you!

01:15:18.133 --> 01:15:19.269
Ohh...

01:15:21.333 --> 01:15:22.917
Oh?

01:15:32.250 --> 01:15:36.742
The last thing you're going to see,
is me eating your precious Rider!

01:15:36.792 --> 01:15:40.158
Come on, Firedrake. You're much
more than you think you are!

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:43.958
- Forget about Lameflame!
- Lameflame?

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:45.708
Lameflame!

01:15:48.042 --> 01:15:50.417
Hilarious! Lameflame!

01:15:50.917 --> 01:15:52.792
Oh ho, that's a good one!

01:15:52.958 --> 01:15:55.875
- Did you make it up?
- Go ahead and eat me!

01:15:56.042 --> 01:15:59.775
But you'll never beat Firedrake.
He'll burn you to a crisp!

01:16:00.542 --> 01:16:03.192
Don't you get it, boy?

01:16:03.458 --> 01:16:05.817
Fire can't hurt me!

01:16:07.250 --> 01:16:08.875
- Bon appetit.
- No!

01:16:09.042 --> 01:16:11.667
Firedrake, help!

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:17.292
What the...

01:16:22.417 --> 01:16:25.042
What is this? It burns!

01:16:27.417 --> 01:16:30.375
No! Not the flame!

01:16:49.458 --> 01:16:52.508
There, there, boy.
Take it easy now.

01:16:54.625 --> 01:16:56.967
Now for the main event!

01:16:59.250 --> 01:17:00.275
Maybe not.

01:17:05.083 --> 01:17:07.142
Firedrake! Are you alright?

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:11.583
Sorrell! Are <i>you</i> alright?

01:17:13.167 --> 01:17:15.175
That's for deserting us!

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:20.042
He's dead.

01:17:20.208 --> 01:17:21.917
He's finally dead.

01:17:22.083 --> 01:17:25.000
Firedrake, that was incredible!

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:28.458
You did it, Scales!
The Prophecy was right.

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:30.458
No.

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:33.292
There's no Rim Of Heaven.

01:17:37.917 --> 01:17:39.850
Thankyou for coming back.

01:17:41.542 --> 01:17:45.625
That's for my eleven brothers
and sisters!

01:17:45.875 --> 01:17:48.408
You swine!

01:17:48.808 --> 01:17:49.859
Take that!

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:52.125
Wait a minute.

01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:11.433
Varin's key.

01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.042
Woah.

01:18:44.250 --> 01:18:45.750
Woah.

01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:52.208
The Rim Of Heaven.

01:19:03.958 --> 01:19:08.208
These must be the Moonflowers
from Slatebeard's stories.

01:19:08.958 --> 01:19:10.758
Dragons.

01:19:12.875 --> 01:19:15.000
Flying free.

01:19:41.042 --> 01:19:42.958
You did it, Dragon Rider.

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:45.567
You brought us to the
Rim Of Heaven.

01:19:46.333 --> 01:19:49.667
Yeah. I guess I did.

01:19:49.833 --> 01:19:53.542
Except I'm not really a
Dragon Rider.

01:19:53.708 --> 01:19:56.875
Well, did Varin call himself
a Dragon Rider?

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:59.625
Maybe that's for others to say.

01:20:00.833 --> 01:20:04.750
- So what're we going to do now?
- I don't know.

01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:09.175
You could stay with us. Or you
could go back to your world.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:12.667
It's your choice, Ben.

01:20:14.850 --> 01:20:16.708
What's the point of
living with humans,

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:18.200
if you're living alone?

01:20:21.958 --> 01:20:25.417
Not all humans are bad humans.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:34.583
Six down:

01:20:34.833 --> 01:20:37.192
Accept the past, and move on.

01:20:39.625 --> 01:20:43.833
I think I might drop by
Professor Greenbloom's,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.675
to see if he needs any help,
with the Resort.

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:50.167
Uhh... What about me?

01:20:51.292 --> 01:20:55.083
You can come too. I'm sure the Professor
would be happy to meet you.

01:20:56.875 --> 01:21:01.183
The moon is almost full. We have to get
back to the valley before it's too late.

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.475
Come on.

01:21:05.792 --> 01:21:08.125
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:21:13.542 --> 01:21:17.817
Okay, you asked for it.
Don't say I didn't warn you.

01:21:18.083 --> 01:21:21.975
Hey! Get back here! Cowards!

01:21:29.875 --> 01:21:33.933
Dragons. For many moons we have
been hiding from the humans,

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.867
watching them take over the world.

01:21:37.033 --> 01:21:40.183
For many moons, we kept running
whenever they came too close.

01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:43.167
hoping they'd let us live in peace.

01:21:43.333 --> 01:21:45.617
But human greed has no end!

01:21:47.375 --> 01:21:49.458
We've sacrificed our dignity.

01:21:49.625 --> 01:21:52.333
We've sacrificed our freedom.

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.900
And we've even sacrificed our children.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:59.033
Buy we will take this no more!

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:01.250
We... Are Dragons!

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:06.375
And it is time for the humans to
feel the wrath of our flame!

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:13.958
This is very bad. Very, very bad.

01:22:15.958 --> 01:22:19.292
Dragons! Tonight, we reclaim our honour!

01:22:19.458 --> 01:22:21.542
Firedrake!

01:22:21.708 --> 01:22:25.000
The humans are going to
pay for their pride!

01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:31.258
Stop!

01:22:32.500 --> 01:22:34.292
Cease fire!

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:41.667
Firedrake! Sorrell! You're alive!

01:22:41.917 --> 01:22:45.167
- Sorrell!
- Mum! Dad!

01:22:47.125 --> 01:22:49.050
There you are, lad.

01:22:49.417 --> 01:22:52.875
- I knew you'd come back.
- Slatebeard.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:54.683
Where've you been?

01:22:55.333 --> 01:22:56.458
Okay.

01:22:56.625 --> 01:22:59.667
Don't get mad. We went to
look for the Rim Of Heaven.

01:22:59.917 --> 01:23:02.108
It's just a myth.

01:23:03.167 --> 01:23:04.733
Did you find it?

01:23:05.083 --> 01:23:09.167
We sure did. And it is beautiful.

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:15.508
Wait, wait! We're still going
to the battle, right?

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:16.811
Right?

01:23:17.011 --> 01:23:19.350
I... I don't know what to say.

01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:22.467
We thought that the humans
had killed you.

01:23:22.833 --> 01:23:25.625
Not all humans are bad humans.

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:27.000
Huh?

01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:29.958
We'll tell you all about it on the way.

01:23:40.333 --> 01:23:42.782
I didn't trust him at all. I thought,
because he was a human,

01:23:42.782 --> 01:23:43.882
he couldn't be good.

01:23:44.008 --> 01:23:48.792
But when it got tough, he showed up.
Ben was there, fighting like a lion.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:55.208
What's your name?

01:24:03.208 --> 01:24:04.875
Ahh.

01:30:32.250 --> 01:30:34.958
The Dragons were saved,

01:30:35.125 --> 01:30:37.167
thanks to the special fire breath,

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:39.892
of the Silver Dragon called Firedrake.

01:30:40.058 --> 01:30:44.833
But, what about the boy?
The name of the movie is 'Dragon Rider.'

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.967
And that little Brownie thingy.
She did a lot as well.

01:30:48.333 --> 01:30:51.542
Okay, okay. So the Dragons were saved
thanks to a Silver Dragon

01:30:51.708 --> 01:30:55.833
called Firedrake, a Brownie called
Sorrell and a boy called Ben.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.917
Who turned out to be
Bravatnar-Gobi-Payanakarmi.

01:30:59.083 --> 01:31:03.333
What about me! I helped too.
Why don't you ever tell stories about me?

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.125
Because you're boring.
What is this mess in the kitchen?

01:31:07.292 --> 01:31:11.333
What have you done?
Come and wash the dishes at once!

01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.750
- Who, me?
- Who else?

01:31:13.917 --> 01:31:16.583
- I don't know how to do that.
- Then you will learn!

01:31:16.750 --> 01:31:18.917
I'm a cook, not a dishwasher!

01:31:19.083 --> 01:31:23.500
- Start with the pot.
- My hands are too tender.

01:31:23.667 --> 01:31:29.042
How do you treat me?
Ganesha, give me a new wife!
