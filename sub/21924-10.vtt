WEBVTT

00:02.877 --> 00:03.878
Previously on "Heartland."

00:04.003 --> 00:05.171
 It's called The Devil's Lake.

00:05.296 --> 00:06.297
Give it a try.

00:09.300 --> 00:11.052
 It's easier when the
horse jumps with you.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.762
 Attila needs my help.

00:12.887 --> 00:14.222
Ty needs my help.

00:14.347 --> 00:17.017
And I have been hired to
do a job, so I'm going.

00:17.142 --> 00:18.560
 Oh, well, you're
not going alone.

00:18.685 --> 00:19.561
 I want to go.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.396
I need to spend
some time with Amy.

00:21.521 --> 00:25.066
 Why all of a sudden you
need to spend time with Amy?

00:25.191 --> 00:26.234
 That MRI?

00:26.359 --> 00:28.945
They found something, a shadow.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.363
Doctor thinks it
might be cancer.

00:30.488 --> 00:32.073
 I just heard the news.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.743
The next village has
been hit, even harder.

00:34.868 --> 00:38.204
 All right we should go,
see what we can do to help.

00:38.329 --> 00:39.664
Amy, it's me.

00:39.789 --> 00:41.958
Listen, don't come, OK?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.543
It's too dangerous.

00:50.216 --> 00:50.925
TIM: Is this it?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.093
Are we there?

00:56.598 --> 00:58.933
English should be
mandatory, like just for all

00:59.059 --> 01:00.685
over the world for traveling.

01:13.406 --> 01:16.242
 My husband, Ty, he
was out here last year.

01:16.368 --> 01:17.369
I don't know if he
told you or not.

01:17.494 --> 01:18.620
But he was in the desert.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.205
He wasn't-- he
wasn't in this area.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.623
It's like it's a totally
different country.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.457
 Don't even try.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.875
The guy doesn't speak English.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.337
Been driving for hours,
hasn't said a word.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.464
And when's the last time
the guy took a shower?

01:29.589 --> 01:31.049
 Dad!

01:31.174 --> 01:33.093
 I just said, when was the
last time the guy took a shower.

01:33.218 --> 01:33.968
Just saying.

01:34.094 --> 01:34.886
 OK, OK.

01:35.011 --> 01:36.596
 Come on.

01:36.721 --> 01:38.056
Can't breathe in
here and then we

01:38.181 --> 01:41.267
got to be overpowered by that.

01:41.393 --> 01:44.938
Hope we're almost there because
I don't know how much longer I

01:45.063 --> 01:46.064
can breathe through my mouth.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.440
 Dad.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.109
The center is about
two kilometers away.

01:49.234 --> 01:50.276
We'll be there soon.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.615
 Great.

01:55.740 --> 01:56.616
OK, Thanks.

02:16.928 --> 02:17.804
 OK.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.643
Not bad.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.938
But how Flame performs
on this rustic mishmash

02:27.063 --> 02:29.315
is neither here nor there.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.319
Honey, it's one
thing to ride well

02:33.445 --> 02:35.363
on a course with
no distractions,

02:35.488 --> 02:37.574
but it's quite another when
there are other horses,

02:37.699 --> 02:40.785
other competitors, not to
mention a whole panel of judges

02:40.910 --> 02:42.662
watching your every move.

02:42.787 --> 02:44.664
Now you see, these are
the things your coach

02:44.789 --> 02:47.667
should be reminding you about.

02:47.792 --> 02:49.210
Oh.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.672
But since she's decided to
fly halfway around the world

02:52.797 --> 02:56.468
two days before your show,
I guess it's up to me.

02:56.593 --> 02:59.012
I was supposed to go
away this weekend, gee.

02:59.137 --> 03:01.056
 Val, Val, you can go away.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.223
We'll be fine.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.351
 All right, look.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.978
They're setting up the course
tomorrow ahead of the event.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.396
Go check it out.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.939
Then you'll know what
to expect at least.

03:10.065 --> 03:10.815
 Definitely.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.150
I'm on it.

03:12.275 --> 03:13.234
It'll also help you
to remember what

03:13.360 --> 03:14.986
professional jumps look like.

03:15.111 --> 03:16.863
 Val, Amy and I are aware--

03:16.988 --> 03:21.576
 Just stop and let me tell
you what you and Amy are not.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.704
You are not, either of you,
taking this seriously enough.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.237
 You OK?

03:57.362 --> 03:59.864
 Yep, I'm fine.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.283
Wow, it's even nicer
than the brochure.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.953
[laughs weakly]

04:07.914 --> 04:09.082
 Attila.

04:09.207 --> 04:10.917
Hey.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.461
 Hey, Alton.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.754
Are our bags safe here?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.431
 Hey, Alton, he looks so good.

04:24.556 --> 04:29.477
 Yes, in body at least, back
to perfect health, thanks to Ty.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.687
 That's great to hear.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.980
I'm sorry, we can
go get settled in.

04:32.105 --> 04:33.565
 No, no, no, no.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.649
It's here you need to be.

04:37.068 --> 04:37.944
Hey.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.116
[whinnies]

04:43.241 --> 04:44.492
 Remarkable.

04:55.503 --> 04:58.131
 I can't wait to
start working with him.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.799
Where's Ty?

04:59.924 --> 05:01.676
 I've been told he's not here.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.845
He was due back this morning.

05:03.970 --> 05:06.389
 I know, but he
hasn't come back yet.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.517
It seems that they can't
reach the back camps.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.312
They've been trying
but all lines are dead.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.605
 What are you saying?

05:13.730 --> 05:15.315
They don't know
where Ty is or what

05:15.440 --> 05:16.691
might have happened to him.

05:20.570 --> 05:35.210
[theme music playing]

05:35.335 --> 05:42.717
(SINGING) And at break of day,
you sank into a dream, a dream.

05:50.809 --> 05:51.685
Dream.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.077
 I can't believe
I forgot my phone.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.495
 Don't worry about it.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.706
Nothing works out here.

06:12.831 --> 06:16.001
Look, let's just take a
minute, Think about this.

06:16.126 --> 06:18.003
 No, I think we should go to
the Vets Without Borders camp,

06:18.128 --> 06:19.004
make sure he's OK.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.130
 No, Amy.

06:20.255 --> 06:21.089
 I can't get through to him.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.465
 He's probably on his way.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.092
 OK, we take one
of these roads.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.510
We're going to miss him.

06:25.635 --> 06:28.096
I don't know if you can
even call them that.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.306
I say we just stay here.

06:30.432 --> 06:31.391
 Bad idea.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.101
 Are you kidding me?

06:33.226 --> 06:34.102
 You think we should go?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.228
 Yeah.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.604
 No, that is not happening.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.606
The lines went down at the camp.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.066
It was a power outage.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.568
I'm sure it happens all
the time around here.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.029
Why are you two so quick
to think the worst?

06:44.154 --> 06:45.363
 [inaudible] on.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.073
It's time to go.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.241
 What did you just call me?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.367
 Dad, come on.
Let's go.

06:49.492 --> 06:50.368
 Just a second.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.453
What did you just call me?

06:55.206 --> 06:56.916
 It's OK to tell us.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.044
I'll be back soon, I promise.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.879
I'm sorry.

07:01.004 --> 07:01.629
Dad,

 Are you coming or not?

07:03.840 --> 07:06.801
[grunting]

07:20.982 --> 07:22.400
 I can't believe
the show is tomorrow.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.612
 Hey, you're ready.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.156
 You know, Lou gets in today.

07:28.281 --> 07:29.532
 Yeah?

07:29.657 --> 07:31.785
 Yeah, you should
come over, say hi.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.661
Maybe stay for dinner.

07:33.787 --> 07:34.871
 You think she'd be into that?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.164
 Yeah, of course she would.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.089
Oh my God.

07:44.214 --> 07:45.799
It's bigger and longer.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.050
What am I going to do?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.260
This is a disaster.

07:49.386 --> 07:52.138
 More like a cruel joke.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.641
 Georgie, I can
just adjust our job.

07:54.766 --> 07:55.850
Now that I've seen
this, I'll just--

07:55.975 --> 07:57.435
I'll mimic it.

07:57.560 --> 08:00.522
 Or, you could come to the
real deal at my family's course.

08:00.647 --> 08:01.356
 I have my own course.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.315
You know that.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.400
 Fine.

08:03.525 --> 08:04.859

Where's Ty?

[non-english speech]

09:06.963 --> 09:08.256
 He said the
neighboring village was

09:08.381 --> 09:10.425
badly damaged, worse than here.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.718
Ty and Bata went to help.

09:11.843 --> 09:13.219
 So when are they coming back?

09:13.345 --> 09:14.262
 That he doesn't know.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.348
 Who's doing all this damage?

09:16.473 --> 09:18.099
 Poachers.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.976
Taking revenge on those who
protect the animals they hunt.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.686
 Ty knew Amy was
waiting for him.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.063
Why would he go play hero now?

 We're making good time.

Shouldn't take too
long to grab the water,

09:49.381 --> 09:51.299

and make another trip back

09:51.424 --> 09:53.468
before nightfall.

09:53.593 --> 09:57.180
How can they burn
people's homes like that?

09:57.305 --> 09:58.306
Disgusting.

 Ah, I'm so sorry.

I don't believe this, but
I've run out of petrol.

that you could spare?

much I appreciate this.

I can feel it.

 Well, I got to agree with you.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.578
 No, Dad, I'm serious.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.246
We can't just sit here and
wait for Ty to come back.

11:03.371 --> 11:06.332
We should go to the next
village and make sure he's OK.

11:06.458 --> 11:10.170
Alton, do you mind giving us
a ride to the next village?

11:10.295 --> 11:11.713
 No.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.715
That's the first sensible
thing I've heard you say.

No to van.

That's not going to happen.

 If you don't ride, you're
safe to stay here while we go.

 I could ride
before I could walk.

Then go pick your horse.

 Those aren't horses.

Those are ponies.

Can he?

 He's here.

He clearly feels
he got a job to do.

always sticking your nose

12:15.151 --> 12:17.070
where it doesn't belong.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.947
It's time you
learned your lesson.

you teach a lesson?

12:22.992 --> 12:26.579
 You know, there was a balance
before you people showed up.

And locals kept
their eyes closed.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.667
We let them live in peace.

You destroyed that balance.

 Right.

12:33.962 --> 12:34.921
And killing endangered
animals, that

doesn't destroy balance too?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.224
[non-english speech]

12:49.894 --> 12:52.313
 So, how did it
go at the course?

12:52.439 --> 12:53.648
 We're in crisis mode.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.316
The actual jump is way
bigger than what we thought.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.361
 We just need a little
re-landscaping, that's all.

12:58.486 --> 13:01.740
 Yeah, so your mom called
and sounds like she's got

13:01.865 --> 13:03.908
a bit of a crisis of her own.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.535
 She's not coming
to the show, is she?

13:05.660 --> 13:07.871
 She feels real bad
about it, Georgie.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.499
She really wanted to be there
but your dad's on his way.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.959
It's OK.

13:13.084 --> 13:15.587
 Sorry, [inaudible] canceled.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.464
 It's all right.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.965
No big deal.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.008
More important things to do.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.518
 Can't believe you're
buying that guy's line.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.187
Attila has a job to do.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.272
The only job that horse is
doing is slowing us down.

13:34.397 --> 13:35.899
 Dad, stop.

13:36.024 --> 13:39.069
Don't you think it's incredible
that Attila followed us here?

13:39.194 --> 13:44.491
If Alton's OK with it,
then so am I. Besides,

13:44.616 --> 13:46.993
I feel like Attila needs me.

13:47.118 --> 13:53.375
Whoa, hey, hey,
whoa, whoa, easy.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.709
Attila!

13:54.834 --> 13:56.461
Attila!

13:56.586 --> 13:57.379
Attila!

14:28.493 --> 14:30.036
This is Ty's phone.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.538
This must be their Jeep.

14:31.663 --> 14:32.539
Ty!

14:32.664 --> 14:33.415
It's still running.

14:33.540 --> 14:34.666
Where are they?

14:34.791 --> 14:35.709
 I'm sure there's a
simple explanation.

14:35.834 --> 14:36.543
Honey, don't worry.

14:36.668 --> 14:37.836
 Ty!

14:37.961 --> 14:39.921
 There was another
vehicle here.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.715
Look at the ruts.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.008
They left at high speed.

14:43.133 --> 14:44.759
I'm afraid that Ty
and Bata were taken.

14:44.884 --> 14:45.677
 What?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.013
They were taken?

14:48.138 --> 14:49.764
 Kidnapped.

14:49.889 --> 14:52.100
Maybe for helping the villagers.

14:52.225 --> 14:55.562
Which means that
poachers have them.

14:55.687 --> 14:56.563
 What?

14:56.688 --> 14:58.398
 Where are you going?

14:58.523 --> 14:59.733
 Find them.

14:59.858 --> 15:04.070
An old Mongolian saying,
a Mongol without his horse

15:04.195 --> 15:06.031
is like a bird
without the wings.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.198
They need each other to fly.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.199
 Do you think this
is the best time

15:08.324 --> 15:10.869
to be quoting Mongolian lore?

15:10.994 --> 15:12.245
 This is Bata's horse.

15:12.370 --> 15:14.122
That's why I chose him.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.499
He will take us to his rider.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.168
And Attila.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.879
He followed us all the
way here for a reason.

15:21.004 --> 15:22.756
I believe he will lead us to Ty.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.799
 Simple as that.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.594
 Clearly, the horse already
started his journey, no?

15:27.719 --> 15:28.636
 No.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.348
No, all this is crap.

15:31.473 --> 15:32.057
 And you.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.684
What do you think?

15:34.809 --> 15:36.102
- Dad.
- No.

15:36.227 --> 15:37.270
This stops now.
We're leaving.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.813
 No, we're not.
We can't go home.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.814
Ty is in--

15:39.939 --> 15:41.107
 We're not going home.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.567
We're going to go
back to the camp

15:42.692 --> 15:44.152
and we're going to call
the authorities, whoever's

15:44.277 --> 15:48.114
in charge of this mess out here.

15:48.239 --> 15:51.451
And you, I don't know who you
are or who you think you are,

15:51.576 --> 15:53.036
but scaring my
daughter half to death,

15:53.161 --> 15:55.789
telling her her
husband's been kidnapped.

15:55.914 --> 15:57.665
And now this story
about the horses

15:57.791 --> 16:01.544
are going to lead us to
him, you don't have a clue.

16:01.670 --> 16:05.006
 I know more than
you think I do.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.091
I'm a shaman.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.009
 You're a shaman.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.803
 Yes, and that's
the highest authority

16:09.928 --> 16:11.346
you'll find out here my man.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.599
Well, I'm a father who's
daughter's putting her trust

16:14.724 --> 16:18.103
and her husband's life in
the hands of a stranger

16:18.228 --> 16:18.978
and I don't like it.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.689
 Like it or not.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.692
I believe that your life is
currently in my hands too, Tim.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.499
 It's OK, kid,
just try it again.

16:39.624 --> 16:40.917
 I don't know what
I'm doing wrong.

16:41.042 --> 16:43.211
 It's just bigger.

16:43.336 --> 16:47.716
 Don't lean forward so
much and keep your eyes up.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.551
Keep a good rhythm too.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.386
Get [inaudible]

16:51.511 --> 16:53.096
 What are you doing here?

16:53.221 --> 16:56.474
 Figured if you wouldn't come
to me, then would come to you.

16:56.599 --> 16:57.600
So let's go.

16:57.726 --> 16:58.518
Try again.

16:58.643 --> 16:59.728
I'll watch.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.062
We're competing against
each other tomorrow.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.397
Why would you help me?

17:02.522 --> 17:04.065
 I'd hate to see you
fall on your butts

17:04.190 --> 17:08.069
again, especially in front of
the entire riding community.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.906
Come on.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.074
Don't make me beg.

17:17.494 --> 17:18.246
 OK.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.414
Fine.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.415
Come on.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.383
 Yes.

17:30.508 --> 17:31.593
You did it.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.470
There you go.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.429
 Good boy.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.770
 Took you long enough,
though, didn't it?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.866
 So you're a shaman.

17:54.991 --> 17:55.867
Ty never told me.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.160
 He wouldn't.

17:57.285 --> 17:58.828
 It's something I
don't share often.

17:58.953 --> 18:00.663
But, yes.

18:00.789 --> 18:04.626
The spirits gave my family the
responsibility generations ago.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.336
My father was one.

18:06.461 --> 18:11.424
My grandfather, my
great grandfather.

18:11.549 --> 18:12.967
Horses are one of
the most respected

18:13.093 --> 18:15.762
animals in our culture.

18:15.887 --> 18:17.681
Mongols know that
they must respect

18:17.806 --> 18:21.893
the spirit to be one with their
horse in perfect partnership.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.895
Ty said you had the
gift for the horses.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.397
But it's more than a gift.

18:25.522 --> 18:26.898
You can find your spirit.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.316
 Their spirit?

18:28.441 --> 18:30.110
I don't know about that.

18:30.235 --> 18:31.569
 I've seen you with Attila.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.197
That horse had no spirit
when you got here.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.990
It's like it's been lost.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.450
But you understand him.

18:37.575 --> 18:38.618
That's why he followed you.

18:38.743 --> 18:40.954
You're giving him
back his spirit.

18:41.079 --> 18:42.205
That's why.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.333
He will give you
back your husband.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.002
 Yeah.

18:47.127 --> 18:48.169
I sure hope so.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.635
 Get out.

19:09.399 --> 19:10.692
 Doesn't matter now.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.861
No one will hear you.

19:12.986 --> 19:14.988
Now turn and walk.

19:15.113 --> 19:15.905
Walk!

19:16.031 --> 19:16.865
Now!

19:19.284 --> 19:20.201
Sorry you don't
get to say goodbye,

19:20.326 --> 19:22.662
but this is it for you.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.873
 Look, it doesn't have
to be this way, OK?

19:24.998 --> 19:26.708
 You brought it on yourselves.

19:29.419 --> 19:32.172
[non-english speech]

19:33.006 --> 19:35.884
[gunshots]

19:45.060 --> 19:45.894
 Are you OK?

19:48.063 --> 19:48.897
Hey!

19:51.441 --> 19:52.942
 Can I please be excused?

19:53.068 --> 19:53.902
 Of course.

19:58.198 --> 19:59.282
 There she is.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.241
 Hey, Dad.

20:00.367 --> 20:01.159
Sorry I'm late.

20:01.284 --> 20:02.118
We lost track of time.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.661
 It's OK.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.080
 Well, it sounds
like that Dylan's

20:05.205 --> 20:06.456
helping you make some progress.

20:06.581 --> 20:07.665
That's good news.

20:07.791 --> 20:08.583
 I think so.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.211
 He knows what he's doing.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.672
 Apparently Dylan's is not
the only one helping you out.

20:13.797 --> 20:16.424
Jack was saying
that Mitch built you

20:16.549 --> 20:17.592
an entire course or something?

20:17.717 --> 20:18.426
 Yeah.

20:18.551 --> 20:19.886
He's been really great.

20:20.011 --> 20:21.054
I don't know what I would
have done without him

20:21.179 --> 20:22.222
these past few days.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.598
He's coming to the
horse show too.

20:23.723 --> 20:24.724
 Huh.

20:24.849 --> 20:25.725
 Yeah.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.645
 Wow.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.021
 Oh.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.106
 I'm sorry.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.023
It could be about the horseshow.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.316
I need to get it.

20:33.441 --> 20:34.234
 OK, fine.

20:34.359 --> 20:35.443
 Thank you.

20:56.840 --> 20:57.966
 You want to say
something, Manan.

21:00.552 --> 21:01.469
 Right there.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.304
Why do you keep calling me that?

21:03.430 --> 21:06.057
Why do you keep calling me man?

21:06.182 --> 21:06.933
 It's not man.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.601
It's Manan.

21:08.727 --> 21:11.688
Mongolian for fog or shadow.

21:11.813 --> 21:16.067
And you, my friend, are
covered in both, so much

21:16.192 --> 21:19.279
so that I could barely see you.

21:19.404 --> 21:20.488
 Right.

21:26.161 --> 21:29.456
Shamans believe in
balance above all else.

21:29.581 --> 21:32.709
If we fall out of
balance, there's trouble.

21:32.834 --> 21:37.380
Bad things happen,
harmful things.

21:37.505 --> 21:42.385
My job is to recognize
imbalance and fix it.

21:42.510 --> 21:46.222
And you, Tim, you
lost your balance.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.432
 You don't know me.

21:47.557 --> 21:49.142
You don't know
anything about me.

21:49.267 --> 21:51.061
 I know that you're suffering.

21:51.186 --> 21:55.857
All the darkness that surrounds
you, that's within you,

21:55.982 --> 21:57.484
is breaking you down.

21:57.609 --> 22:01.821
And the sad part is I think
you're a man who chose to build

22:01.946 --> 22:04.657
his life around that darkness.

22:04.783 --> 22:09.037
Maybe because you feel that
you don't deserve light.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.789
You do, Time.

22:10.914 --> 22:12.499
You do.

22:12.624 --> 22:14.542
 Maybe the darkness
chooses you.

22:14.668 --> 22:15.877
Maybe you don't have a choice.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.672
You ever think of that?

22:18.797 --> 22:22.884
This, everything happening here.

22:26.429 --> 22:29.808
I didn't choose this, friend.

22:29.933 --> 22:36.106
I came here because I wanted
to be with my daughter,

22:36.231 --> 22:42.529
because I want to enjoy
the time I have left.

22:42.654 --> 22:43.738
 How much time do you have?

22:51.162 --> 22:51.996
 I don't know.

22:55.083 --> 22:58.503
The doctors at home, think
that I might have cancer.

23:02.799 --> 23:06.678
Because they saw a shadow.

23:06.803 --> 23:09.723
 Tim, it's time to
let your shadows go.

23:21.317 --> 23:22.110
 Come on.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.076
All right.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.619
Come on.

23:31.745 --> 23:32.787
Let's keep going, bud.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.960
Let's keep moving.

23:39.085 --> 23:39.919
Come on.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.130
 No.

23:42.255 --> 23:43.256
 Come on, bud.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.549
 Better to stay here.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.738
 What are we doing
out here, man?

24:06.863 --> 24:08.156
What's this going to
do to our families

24:08.281 --> 24:09.115
if we can't make it home?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.158
Huh?

24:13.286 --> 24:14.120
Amy's--

24:28.551 --> 24:29.844
 Lindy's not going
to know I'm her dad.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.519
She's not going to remember me.

24:43.900 --> 24:44.693
Pada.

24:48.405 --> 24:50.031
Pada.

24:50.156 --> 24:50.990
Just breathe.

24:54.285 --> 24:55.161
Hey.

24:55.286 --> 24:56.204
Hey.

26:12.697 --> 26:16.368
 Are we ever
going to find them?

26:16.493 --> 26:19.412
 Well, we can't give up now.

26:19.537 --> 26:20.372
No.

26:20.497 --> 26:21.289
We've come too far.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.251
we're going to find them.

26:28.046 --> 26:30.298
 I'm so glad you came, Dad.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.471
 We're going to find them.

26:36.596 --> 26:38.223
And then we're going to shower.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.150
 There's something
I need to do.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.828
Alton, I know you
think that Attila

26:59.953 --> 27:05.083
is going to stay with us, but I
want to try ponying him again.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.919
I can't risk losing him too.

27:17.637 --> 27:18.680
It's OK.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.145
What a good boy.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.862
 Why didn't you tell us
about this last night?

27:33.987 --> 27:35.613
 I don't know.
It's creepy.

27:35.739 --> 27:36.948
They're calling me
the mystery girl

27:37.073 --> 27:38.992
with a sad homemade course.

27:39.117 --> 27:41.327
 So, you didn't know dealing
with these pictures of being

27:41.453 --> 27:44.497
taken no and I'm totally
creeped out who took them

27:44.622 --> 27:47.250
and why do they care who
I am or what we're doing?

27:47.375 --> 27:49.627
 I'm more concerned with
the who than the why.

27:49.753 --> 27:52.630
 Yeah, exactly.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.382
 Hey, sweetheart.

27:54.507 --> 27:56.968
Hey, let's put this out
of our minds for now.

27:57.093 --> 27:57.844
OK?

27:57.969 --> 27:58.970
- It's too late.
- What?

27:59.095 --> 27:59.971
Stop.
It's not too late.

28:00.096 --> 28:00.972
 You're going to be great.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.057
 I'm going to be terrible.

28:02.182 --> 28:03.391
I haven't had enough practice.

28:03.516 --> 28:05.435
 You're going to be just fine.

28:05.560 --> 28:06.519
Now, we got to go.

28:06.644 --> 28:08.480
Get you registered.

28:08.605 --> 28:09.898
 Come on, Katie.

28:10.023 --> 28:12.233
Go to your play date.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.360
 Let's go, GG.

28:13.485 --> 28:15.195
 All right.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.781
 I am so sorry I'm not
the one to take you.

28:17.906 --> 28:19.366
 You'll be there
though, right, promise?

28:19.491 --> 28:21.409
My cheering section is
going to be a little

28:21.534 --> 28:22.786
low without Lou or Amy there.

28:22.911 --> 28:24.204
 Course I will.
You kidding me?

28:24.329 --> 28:25.705
I wouldn't miss
it for the world.

28:25.830 --> 28:28.500
And when Lindsay wakes
up in half an hour

28:28.625 --> 28:32.796
from her nap and then I
feed her a snack and we go.

28:32.921 --> 28:34.422
Plenty of time before
you're up, right?

28:34.547 --> 28:35.298
I will be there.

28:35.423 --> 28:36.299
I promise.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.051
 OK.

28:38.176 --> 28:40.220
 Oh, you're going
to be so great.

28:40.345 --> 28:42.222
 Thank you.

28:42.347 --> 28:43.098
OK, bye.

28:43.223 --> 28:44.099
 Bye.

29:02.992 --> 29:05.787
 You're OK.

29:05.912 --> 29:07.789
[horse neighing]

29:08.581 --> 29:10.792
It's OK.

29:10.917 --> 29:13.128
Is everything all right?

29:13.253 --> 29:14.629
 Yeah.

29:14.754 --> 29:16.423
Attila's just getting a
little bit spooked out here.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.383
I think we all are.

29:18.508 --> 29:19.259
Whoa, boy.

29:19.384 --> 29:20.218
Hey.

29:20.343 --> 29:21.720
Hey.

29:21.845 --> 29:22.887
 You're right.

29:23.013 --> 29:23.972
This is the place.

29:27.434 --> 29:28.560
Let go of Attila's lead.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.770
 No I can't lose him.

29:30.895 --> 30:42.384
 Amy, let go
[non-english speech]

31:40.025 --> 31:41.026
 OK, shh, shh.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.652
What are you doing here?

31:42.777 --> 31:43.945
 I just wanted to stop by
and wish Georgie good luck

31:44.070 --> 31:44.988
before the show.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.531
 Well, you're a little late.

31:46.656 --> 31:47.741
She already left.

31:47.866 --> 31:49.367
I can't go yet
because this one--

31:49.492 --> 31:52.162
 She didn't like her breakfast?

31:52.287 --> 31:53.455
 Yeah, she didn't
like her breakfast,

31:53.580 --> 31:54.873
that's what's happening.

31:54.998 --> 31:57.000
Excuse me.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.044
 OK, maybe she's
doing that, you know,

31:59.169 --> 32:01.171
strange thing that
babies do when they

32:01.296 --> 32:03.423
don't really know somebody.

32:03.548 --> 32:05.467
 What?

32:05.592 --> 32:06.551
 If I just--
it's OK.

32:06.676 --> 32:07.510
 Seriously?

32:07.635 --> 32:08.428
 Yeah, let me try.

32:08.553 --> 32:09.137
Just let me try.

32:09.262 --> 32:10.638
 Please, by all means.

32:10.764 --> 32:11.973
 Oh, go with a stranger.

32:15.352 --> 32:16.394
 See?

32:16.519 --> 32:17.729
You're OK.

32:17.854 --> 32:18.980
You're OK.

32:19.105 --> 32:19.981
I got her, man.

32:20.106 --> 32:21.483
It's all right.

32:21.608 --> 32:22.359
It's all right.

32:22.484 --> 32:23.818
Why don't you go--
- Thanks.

32:23.943 --> 32:24.736
 --clean yourself up.

32:24.861 --> 32:25.653
 Yeah, OK.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.073
This is great.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.324
 You like Uncle Mitch.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.283
Mitch.

32:30.408 --> 32:31.409
[baby cries]

32:31.534 --> 32:32.619
 No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

32:32.744 --> 32:33.536
She won't stop.

32:33.661 --> 32:34.454
 It's OK.

32:34.579 --> 32:35.455
It's OK.

32:38.500 --> 32:41.961
[applause]

32:42.462 --> 32:43.338
 Hey.

32:52.889 --> 32:53.807
[baby cries]

32:53.932 --> 32:55.392
 When in doubt, get Lambie.

32:55.517 --> 32:57.435
It always calms Lyndy down.

32:57.560 --> 32:58.144
What's a Lambie?

32:58.269 --> 32:59.145
What's a Lambie?

32:59.270 --> 33:00.480
What's a Lambie?

33:00.605 --> 33:03.817
 I, I, I, I don't
know what a Lambie is.

33:03.942 --> 33:05.360
 You don't know
what a Lambie is.

33:05.485 --> 33:07.028
 --everything about my family.

33:07.153 --> 33:08.113
I guess you don't, huh?

33:08.238 --> 33:09.698
[baby cries]

33:11.449 --> 33:13.034
PA: Now on the course, Dylan
Westfield, riding Arrow.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.588
 What about this?

33:25.714 --> 33:28.091
 It's a pig, Peter, It
doesn't even look like a lamb.

33:28.216 --> 33:29.426
Come on, get your
head in the game.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.136
 Honestly?

33:31.261 --> 33:32.679
Like a little blankie.

33:32.804 --> 33:34.472
Little white blankie thing
that looked like a lamb.

33:34.597 --> 33:35.390
Where is it?

33:35.515 --> 33:37.225
[baby crying]

33:37.350 --> 33:39.644
Hey, look, what is this?

33:39.769 --> 33:40.895
What, what what?

33:41.021 --> 33:41.813
That's it?

33:41.938 --> 33:42.731
I think this is--

33:42.856 --> 33:44.357
is this lambie?

33:44.482 --> 33:45.984
Oh.

33:46.109 --> 33:47.694
 You destroyed it.

34:01.332 --> 34:03.710
PA: That was Dylan
Westfield riding Arrow.

34:03.835 --> 34:06.713
And that's the time to beat.

34:06.838 --> 34:09.049
 He was pretty good.

34:09.174 --> 34:12.427
But I've seen you do better.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.764
PA: Up next Shannon
Baker on Golden Girl.

34:15.889 --> 34:17.514
[baby crying]

34:17.639 --> 34:19.476
 (SINGING) Had the
lamb for dinner.

34:19.601 --> 34:23.355
 Oh, stop, stop,
Please, just stop, stop.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.105
It's OK.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.190
You know what?

34:25.315 --> 34:26.733
You go, OK?
You just go.

34:26.858 --> 34:27.692
You go to the show.

34:27.817 --> 34:29.110
Leave the baby here.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.445
At least one of us will be
there to support Georgie.

34:30.570 --> 34:31.571
All right?
That's fine.

34:31.696 --> 34:32.989
You can play the
hero like you been

34:33.114 --> 34:34.074
playing since I've
been gone, so I'm

34:34.199 --> 34:35.241
sure you'll love doing that.

34:35.367 --> 34:36.451
 What is that supposed to mean?

34:36.576 --> 34:37.202
 Nothing.

34:37.327 --> 34:39.120
Seriously, just go.

34:39.245 --> 34:40.038
No, it's fine.

34:40.163 --> 34:41.373
 Peter, you go.

34:41.498 --> 34:42.290
 I can't.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.542
I can't bring a crying baby to--

34:44.668 --> 34:45.793
 Why are we even
arguing about this?

34:45.918 --> 34:47.253
You're her father.
You should be there.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.713
I can look after the baby.
- No, you can't.

34:48.838 --> 34:50.465
 Why not?

34:50.590 --> 34:51.800
 Because as much as you want
to be part of this family,

34:51.925 --> 34:52.592
you're not on the registered
babysitter's list.

34:52.717 --> 34:53.760
OK?

34:53.885 --> 34:55.094
Sorry, pal, but
that's the way it is.

35:01.142 --> 35:02.936
 Wait, wait, wait.

35:03.061 --> 35:04.104
 Forget it.

35:04.229 --> 35:05.188
Just put her in the crib and go.

35:05.313 --> 35:06.106
 Hold on.

35:06.231 --> 35:07.649
Hold on.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.901
Says it's in the drawer.

35:10.026 --> 35:11.152
What is this?

35:11.277 --> 35:12.445
Yes, yes, yes,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

35:14.864 --> 35:15.657
 Lambies!

35:21.371 --> 35:22.372
 OK.
Good.

35:22.497 --> 35:23.915
OK.

35:24.040 --> 35:24.958
Listen, I'm going to go pack
a diaper bag and we'll go.

35:25.083 --> 35:25.834
OK?

35:25.959 --> 35:27.168
Right?

35:27.293 --> 35:28.086
We both made a
promise to Georgie.

35:28.211 --> 35:29.254
I'm driving.

35:32.590 --> 35:33.216
 OK.

35:33.341 --> 35:34.342
Look at the lambie.

35:34.467 --> 35:35.385
That's what you wanted.

35:35.510 --> 35:36.344
Yes.

35:47.897 --> 35:48.857
 OK, Bud.

36:05.081 --> 36:05.874
 There she is.

36:10.170 --> 36:12.630
PA: Up next, Georgie
Fleming-Morris, riding Flame.

36:15.800 --> 36:16.634
 OK.

37:08.269 --> 37:12.816
PA: That was Georgie
Fleming-Morris riding Flame.

37:12.941 --> 37:17.445
That time was enough to
give Georgie third place.

37:17.570 --> 37:20.949
The winner is Dylan
Westfield riding Arrow.

37:31.209 --> 37:32.419
 Nice ride.

37:32.544 --> 37:35.714
 Not so bad yourself.

37:35.839 --> 37:38.591
 Well, thanks.

37:38.717 --> 37:43.471
OK, um, that
website, weird, huh?

37:43.596 --> 37:45.557
Paparazzi hiding in the bushes.

37:45.682 --> 37:46.975
 Yeah, not just weird.

37:47.100 --> 37:48.685
Creepy.

37:48.810 --> 37:51.604
And besides, I'm not
exactly newsworthy.

37:51.730 --> 37:54.774
 You're kidding,
right, Brown Eyes?

37:54.899 --> 37:58.278
With the way you ride, you're
guaranteed be a headliner.

38:03.199 --> 38:04.617
Good job.

38:04.743 --> 38:05.577
 Thanks.

38:19.132 --> 38:22.552
 Just got off the phone with
the Vets Without Borders camp.

38:22.677 --> 38:25.138
Adam's going to be fine,
just a few cracked ribs

38:25.263 --> 38:26.890
and some pretty bad bruising.

38:27.015 --> 38:28.850
And the camp's now back on line.
- That's good to hear.

38:28.975 --> 38:29.934
 Yeah.

38:30.060 --> 38:30.935
 Look at what's
going on out there.

38:33.897 --> 38:35.732
 It's like he's
a different horse.

38:35.857 --> 38:39.861
 Attila is officially
healed, both body and spirit.

38:39.986 --> 38:41.196
 He found his balance.

38:41.321 --> 38:42.697
Now he can go on living.

38:45.450 --> 38:46.284
I'll take good care of him.

38:46.409 --> 38:47.452
I promise.

38:51.414 --> 38:52.499
 Well, we should go.

38:52.624 --> 38:53.625
Let's get home to
our little girl.

38:53.750 --> 38:55.835
 That sounds good to me.

38:55.960 --> 38:59.839
Alton, thank you so
much for everything.

38:59.964 --> 39:02.217
 Thank you.

39:02.342 --> 39:03.468
 Coming, Dad?

39:03.593 --> 39:05.929
 Yeah, be there in a minute.

39:06.054 --> 39:06.888
 OK.

39:16.815 --> 39:20.944
 You uh, you talk
about balance.

39:21.069 --> 39:22.987
 It's not something
you talk about, Tim.

39:23.113 --> 39:24.072
It's something you find.

39:29.285 --> 39:30.078
 How do I find it?

39:45.927 --> 39:48.763
 The yin and the yang
of our Mongolian flag.

39:48.888 --> 39:51.850
You can have darkness, Tim,
but you need light too.

39:55.979 --> 39:58.565
It's the balance between
them that can change lives.

40:05.196 --> 40:08.324
 This bird, what is it?

40:08.450 --> 40:12.746
 It's a sacred falcon, our
country's official bird.

40:12.871 --> 40:16.207
 I saw one this morning.

40:16.332 --> 40:17.542
 Then you're a lucky man.

40:17.667 --> 40:19.586
They live in the steppes.

40:19.711 --> 40:23.048
To see one in the desert
is more than rare.

40:29.929 --> 40:33.683
The bird's a warrior,
a symbol of bravery.

40:33.808 --> 40:37.771
Keep it, to balance out
the dark and to remind

40:37.896 --> 40:42.484
yourself to be brave
enough to let the light in.

40:57.415 --> 40:58.166
 Thank you.

41:04.297 --> 41:06.675
You're a good man, Alton.

42:22.792 --> 42:24.085
 How are you doing?

42:24.210 --> 42:26.171
 Good.

42:26.296 --> 42:27.088
Really good.

42:30.842 --> 42:37.724
 Hey, Tim, I just
wanted to say, thank you.

42:37.849 --> 42:40.935
There was a moment
there where I thought

42:41.061 --> 42:43.980
I'd never see this place again.

42:44.105 --> 42:46.733
And I'm home now
because of you and Amy,

42:46.858 --> 42:50.111
so I want to say thank
you for going with Amy.

42:50.236 --> 42:53.198
 Well, I wasn't going
to let her go alone.

42:53.323 --> 42:56.159
I'm a dad.

42:56.284 --> 42:59.245
You'll learn soon enough
that that's what dads

42:59.371 --> 43:01.748
do for as long as they can.

43:14.302 --> 43:17.389
 It's just so good to
be home with my little--

43:17.514 --> 43:19.265
 Dada.

43:19.391 --> 43:21.309

43:21.434 --> 43:22.560
 Did you just say Dada?

43:22.686 --> 43:23.478
 She did.

43:23.603 --> 43:25.105
I heard that.

43:25.230 --> 43:28.983
