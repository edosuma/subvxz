SUE SIMMONS:
First there was the Twist,

00:21.325 --> 00:23.110
then the Mashed Potato,
the Hustle.

00:23.153 --> 00:26.330
In the '70s, everyone wanted
to learn to dance like

00:26.374 --> 00:28.158
John Travolta
inSaturday Night Fever.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.507
But in 1990,

00:29.551 --> 00:32.075
all anyone wants to do
is "Vogue."

00:32.119 --> 00:33.685
Madonna's song, "Vogue," is in

00:33.729 --> 00:36.166
its third week at number one
on the pop charts,

00:36.210 --> 00:38.212
And the once-obscure
dance moves

00:38.255 --> 00:40.170
popularized by
the Material Girl's hit,

00:40.214 --> 00:43.086
borrowed from New York's
hidden ball culture,

00:43.130 --> 00:45.262
are now truly "in fashion."

I'm Missy Thompson
from Staten Island.

00:50.398 --> 00:52.748
I work as an executive assistantand I started taking

00:52.791 --> 00:55.011
the late ferry and having
my husband order pizza

00:55.055 --> 00:57.144
for dinner so I could stayin the city and take this class.

01:00.364 --> 01:03.106
I've met girls from
New Jersey and Scarsdale

01:03.150 --> 01:05.195
and the Upper West Side, even.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.110
-And what do you think it--

01:07.154 --> 01:09.373
that it is that's
drawing all of you here?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.505
MISSY AND CROWD:
Madonna!

01:12.507 --> 01:14.291
If you're interested
in learning how to Vogue,

01:14.335 --> 01:17.033
classes are being taught
at the YMCA

01:17.077 --> 01:19.122
three days a week
by resident experts.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.471
But be sure to sign up early.

01:20.515 --> 01:23.257
Channel 5 News is being told
that most classes

01:30.307 --> 01:32.396
Slow down. Looks like you aboutto have a heart attack.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.268
I need you to add
one more class this week.

01:34.311 --> 01:37.575
I've kicked gangbangers
off the basketball court

01:37.619 --> 01:40.012
and shooed homeless men
out of the pool, no problem.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.407
But these bridge and tunnel
bitches are terrifying.

01:44.365 --> 01:47.194
-You better stop with that.
-Honestly, Damon.

01:47.237 --> 01:48.717
I've never seen
anything like it.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.284

-Okay.

01:54.288 --> 01:55.593
I am more than happy
to add another class,

the Taylor Dane tour

05:05.609 --> 05:06.610
introduced me
to the talent scout.

05:06.654 --> 05:08.220
So I showed her some dance moves

05:08.264 --> 05:09.700
right there on the spot.

10:28.105 --> 10:30.064
My teacher at the time thought

10:30.107 --> 10:31.848
I was crazy to drop my studies

10:31.892 --> 10:34.764
and go dance for him.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.766
But she also knew...

10:36.810 --> 10:39.334
those audiences
needed to see me.

10:39.377 --> 10:41.815
A strong, talented black woman

10:41.858 --> 10:45.906
taking up space
in those white concert halls

10:45.949 --> 10:48.735
and auditoriums.

10:48.778 --> 10:51.781
The world needs
to see you, Damon.

10:51.825 --> 10:54.566
A man who knows who he is.

10:54.610 --> 10:59.136
I'm not going to say no
to this level of exposure.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.748
Even if pop music
isn't my cup of tea.

11:06.578 --> 11:08.580
You have my blessing.

11:08.624 --> 11:10.974
You don't need
a teacher anymore.

11:11.018 --> 11:12.367
You're the teacher now.

11:12.410 --> 11:15.196
Teach the world who you are.

11:17.851 --> 11:20.636
-Thank you, Helena.

11:21.811 --> 11:24.422
But you got to promise me
you'll come back

11:24.466 --> 11:27.121
and finish your degree
when this tour is over.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.950
I promise. I will.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.386
Good.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.910
Now... go to rehearsal.

11:51.623 --> 11:52.973
All right, y'all,
all hands on deck.

11:53.016 --> 11:54.104
We got to do right
by Damon and make sure

11:54.148 --> 11:56.019
he gets the support he deserves.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.368
This is your moment, baby.

12:00.850 --> 12:04.201
This is the moment I have been
waiting for, children.

12:04.245 --> 12:08.031
And I need each of you
to do your part.

12:08.075 --> 12:09.859
Little Ricky here
has been presented

12:09.903 --> 12:10.904
with a once-in-a-lifetime

12:10.947 --> 12:12.775
mainstream opportunity.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.996
We cannot let him
fuck this up.

12:16.039 --> 12:17.171
BLANCA:
All right, listen,

12:17.214 --> 12:19.042
our baby boy has got the goods.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.391
He just don't got that polish,

12:20.435 --> 12:22.698
-that star-level sheen yet.

12:22.742 --> 12:25.919
-DAMON: Quiet.
-We all need to chip in
and get Damon a look

12:25.962 --> 12:28.051
-to make him stand out.
-ELEKTRA: I won't coddle you.

12:28.095 --> 12:29.792
I don't nurture.

12:29.836 --> 12:32.229
And I'll never deliver inspiringpep talks that end in hugs.

12:32.273 --> 12:36.668
But... I am a provider.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.627
And I need Wintour
to yield results.

12:38.670 --> 12:42.152
I expect excellence.
Nothing less.

12:42.196 --> 12:44.807
So go out
and make this boy over.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.244
You have 24 hours.

12:47.288 --> 12:49.377

14:06.019 --> 14:07.977
I have washed off
the filth of Evangelista.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.937
You are officially a Wintour.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.590
Now, let me ask you something.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.288
Do you still carry a torch
for Damon?

14:14.331 --> 14:16.768
Please.

14:16.812 --> 14:18.335
He's ancient history.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.990
Good.
We Wintours are ruthless.

14:21.034 --> 14:23.297
I expect you
to leave him beaten,

balled up in a corner and cryingfor his brick of a mother.

14:26.953 --> 14:30.957

to bring glory to my house

14:31.000 --> 14:32.784
with a spot on Madonna's tour,

14:32.828 --> 14:35.352
don't bother returning.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.058
-Oh!
-Whoa!

14:45.101 --> 14:47.799
Yes, bitch! Aw, you is looking

14:47.843 --> 14:51.151

all shiny and polished

14:51.194 --> 14:52.761

14:52.804 --> 14:55.155
-We see you,
and she ain't lying.

14:55.198 --> 14:57.157
Now, get some fuel
before your big day.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.071
DAMON:
I can't eat right now.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.768
My stomach can't stop turning.

14:59.811 --> 15:00.987
Aw, that's just butterflies
in your belly.

15:01.030 --> 15:03.598

Okay, listen up.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.518
Damon, you ready.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.564
You got the talent.

15:13.608 --> 15:15.001
You're intelligent.

15:15.044 --> 15:17.177
You look good.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.657
-And more important,
you got heart,

15:19.701 --> 15:22.051
and that's what
they're gonna see.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.183
So break a leg, baby.

15:25.141 --> 15:27.056
I don't know where I would be
without you all.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.799
And no matter what happens,
we always gonna be here.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.019
-Hm.
-And I'm so proud of you.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.846
Thank you.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.196
Yeah, and it just got

15:36.239 --> 15:38.024
a little harder for me
to stand out.

15:38.067 --> 15:39.416
Looks like we're
in the same group.

15:39.460 --> 15:42.419
I mean, I shouldn't be surprisedthat I see a familiar face.

15:42.463 --> 15:44.117
Looks like every dancer
from the city is here.

15:44.160 --> 15:45.988
Well, they looking for
the best of the best.

15:46.032 --> 15:48.077
Looks like we the only two
from ballroom, though.

15:48.121 --> 15:49.992
Think we got a good shot?

15:50.036 --> 15:52.125
I think you got a good shot.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.170

17:33.313 --> 17:35.315
Everybody in there was.

17:39.493 --> 17:41.712
Especially him.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.279
Do you really think
we got a shot

17:43.323 --> 17:45.542
-at getting this callback?
-They got to call us back.

I think it's definitely
one of the three of us.

17:47.501 --> 17:51.026

for that call.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.386
Mother, can you sit down?
You're making me nervous.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.258
It's been a day
since your audition.

18:05.301 --> 18:06.128
How long were they
gonna make you wait?

18:06.172 --> 18:07.564
They should be getting back
to me today.

18:07.608 --> 18:09.610
-Oh!

18:11.394 --> 18:12.308
Hello?

18:12.352 --> 18:15.355
Yeah, okay, one sec.

18:15.398 --> 18:16.443
Damon, it's for you.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.199
Hello?

18:33.242 --> 18:34.852
I understand.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.333
Thank you so much.

18:39.248 --> 18:41.729
-What did they say?
-I, uh,

18:41.772 --> 18:44.297
I got the callback.

18:44.340 --> 18:47.213
Good.

18:47.256 --> 18:50.216
I got the callback.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.869
We got the callback.

18:51.913 --> 18:54.350
Thanks for calling.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.615
-Oh, Damon.

18:58.659 --> 19:01.096
I got a callback.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.012
-What?
-I can't believe it.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.231
I've been working
so hard for this!

19:05.274 --> 19:06.841
And it's-- Let me tell you,

19:06.884 --> 19:08.886
it's all worth it. You about
to dance for Madonna!

19:08.930 --> 19:10.801
No, no, no, not yet, not yet.
It-It's just a callback,

19:10.845 --> 19:12.586
-it's just a callback.
-What? Just a callback?

19:12.629 --> 19:15.197
This is about acceptance.
Someone from ballroom culture

19:15.241 --> 19:17.591
is about to get their chance,you're about to be a part of...

19:17.634 --> 19:21.203
No, you about to influence
popular culture.

19:21.247 --> 19:25.642
Oh, my baby about to be
mainstream!

19:37.132 --> 19:40.135
You're still at it? Enough.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.050
Come lay with me
before we head out.

19:42.093 --> 19:43.269
I got to practice.

19:43.312 --> 19:44.835
This Butch Queen Vogue
Femme category

19:44.879 --> 19:47.490
is not an easy one for me.

19:47.534 --> 19:49.362
The competition tonightis stiff.

19:49.405 --> 19:51.451
I'm stiff.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.627
-Come to bed.

19:53.670 --> 19:57.239
After the ball, I promise.
I got to conserve my energy.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.675
Humping for 30 minutes
isn't gonna affect

19:58.719 --> 20:00.460
whether you win or lose.

20:00.503 --> 20:01.765
How would you know?

20:01.809 --> 20:03.376
You never walked a ball,
you ain't in a house.

20:03.419 --> 20:05.073
Excuse me for wanting
to be independent,

20:05.116 --> 20:07.336
to not have a master.

20:07.380 --> 20:08.381
The fuck's that supposed
to mean?

20:08.424 --> 20:09.947
You're a follower.

20:09.991 --> 20:11.384
You let that bitch Elektra
pull you around

20:11.427 --> 20:12.863
like a dog on a short leash.

20:12.907 --> 20:14.387
Ay, you need to watch
your mouth.

20:14.430 --> 20:17.477
And you need to grow
a pair of balls. Yeah?

20:17.520 --> 20:19.174
Stand up for yourself.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.089
Be a man and say
what's on your mind.

20:21.132 --> 20:22.438
Okay, I will.

20:22.482 --> 20:25.702
I made a mistake
ending things with Damon.

20:25.746 --> 20:27.617
-Then go back to him!
-I can't believe

20:27.661 --> 20:30.272
I ever blew up my life for you.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.622
Damon believed in me,
in my dreams.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.451
You're just a selfish,
self-centered bitch.

20:35.495 --> 20:37.888
Tired of your toxic-ass energy.

20:37.932 --> 20:40.413
Toxic? Yeah, I'm living
the happy life

20:40.456 --> 20:42.328
you're pretending to live.
I don't need to pollute

20:42.371 --> 20:46.332
my body with the negativity
you keep spreading.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.334
That's not what you were sayinglast night when your legs

20:48.377 --> 20:50.161
-were behind my shoulders.
-You know,

20:50.205 --> 20:51.511
if your swerve game
was so good...

20:51.554 --> 20:52.555
-Mm-hmm?
-...you wouldn't need a map

20:52.599 --> 20:53.687
to find my G-spot.

20:53.730 --> 20:55.341
-I got some advice for you, boo.-Mm.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.951
-Mm-hmm.
-Learn to swallow your pride

20:56.994 --> 20:58.431
as well as you do men and maybe

20:58.474 --> 21:00.520
-you wouldn't end up alone.
-Boy, bye. I'm blessed

21:00.563 --> 21:03.436
and highly favored.
I will not be alone!

21:09.355 --> 21:12.967
Tonight is the last night
that Ricky has the opportunity

21:13.010 --> 21:15.143
to practice for his audition
with Queen Madonna,

21:15.186 --> 21:17.711
otherwise known
as my future best friend.

21:17.754 --> 21:19.974
While I was praying for guidanceon how best

21:20.017 --> 21:22.368
to help dear Ricky,
a single question

21:22.411 --> 21:24.370
kept appearing in my mind.

21:24.413 --> 21:27.286
W.W.C.D.?

21:28.591 --> 21:30.463
What would Candy do?

21:30.506 --> 21:32.726
She was not a thinker.
She did not have

21:32.769 --> 21:36.425
the capacity to ruminate
on a problem.

21:36.469 --> 21:38.688
She took action,

21:38.732 --> 21:42.257
which is what
we are going to do.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.785
Is that Candy's hammer?

21:48.829 --> 21:50.352
Her prized possession.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.181
And if she were here,
she would use it...

21:53.224 --> 21:55.618
to break Damon's
motherfucking foot.

21:55.662 --> 21:57.577
It's the only way
to ensure Ricky's victory

21:57.620 --> 22:00.580
and my topless sunbathing
vacation in Capri with Miss M.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.582
So, you want us to just

22:02.625 --> 22:04.018
stroll up on Damon

22:04.061 --> 22:05.759
-and smash him in the foot?
-Do I have

22:05.802 --> 22:09.502
to explain everything?!

22:09.545 --> 22:11.417
You get close and then
you throw it at his foot

22:11.460 --> 22:13.419
as hard as you can
and in the chaos that follows,

22:13.462 --> 22:16.030
cry and say how sorry you are
and that you had just

22:16.073 --> 22:18.380
applied Vaseline Intensive Carelotion to your hands

22:18.424 --> 22:19.816
and the hammer
slipped out of them.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.819
Seriously? How're we gonna aim
a hammer like that?

22:26.562 --> 22:28.956
Candy would've found a way.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.610
I'm not comfortable with this.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.438
Ricky is good.

22:32.481 --> 22:33.656
He can win on his own.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.528
No.

22:35.571 --> 22:37.530
I will not risk failure.

22:37.573 --> 22:38.748
This is too important

22:38.792 --> 22:40.837
-to this house.
-Then why don't you do it?

22:40.881 --> 22:42.491
Oh, shit.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.541
A mother never gets
her hands dirty.

22:48.584 --> 22:50.630
As an added incentive, whoever

22:50.673 --> 22:51.979
throws the hammer
gets to accompany me

22:52.022 --> 22:54.024
to Madonna's birthday party.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.861
All right, all right, all right.

23:04.905 --> 23:06.776
It's all happening
for us, children.

23:06.820 --> 23:10.127
"Vogue" has hit number one
on the charts,

23:10.171 --> 23:12.826
-and the word is out--

23:12.869 --> 23:14.828
ballroom is in.

23:14.871 --> 23:18.092
-Come on, now.

23:18.135 --> 23:21.008
Ladies and gentlemen,
ballroom has gone mainstream

23:21.051 --> 23:24.141
and I am here for it.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.056
-All right,
let's get this party

23:26.100 --> 23:28.581
started. The category is:

23:28.624 --> 23:30.147
Runway.

23:30.191 --> 23:33.716
Bring it like old-school,
black and white cinema.

23:35.718 --> 23:38.591
Yes, girl. Work it out
with that side step.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.070
We see you, girl.

23:40.114 --> 23:42.377
-Yes.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.553
I likey, likey, likey.

23:44.597 --> 23:46.425
Work it out, work it out.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.166
Honey, I see you.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.038
Uh-huh. Work it out.

23:51.081 --> 23:54.607
And what have we here?

23:54.650 --> 23:56.478
Very Joan.

23:56.522 --> 23:57.653
Very Crawford.

23:57.697 --> 23:59.133
-Yes.
-ANGEL: We need your help.

23:59.176 --> 24:00.526
-What happened?
-Just come.
-Come on.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.615
♪ 'Cause there's music
in the air♪

24:02.658 --> 24:04.312
♪ And lots of lovin'

24:04.355 --> 24:05.748
I see you, boo.

24:05.792 --> 24:09.360
Hey, tell them
what you just told me.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.711
I know I'm betraying
Mother Elektra,

24:11.754 --> 24:12.842
but this bitch has gone

24:12.886 --> 24:14.757
-too far this time.
-She put a hit out

24:14.801 --> 24:17.368
-on Damon.
-A hit? On his life?

24:17.412 --> 24:19.196
No. His foot.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.721
It's all going down tonight.
We're supposed to make it

24:21.764 --> 24:23.331
-look like an accident.
-They talking about

24:23.374 --> 24:24.724
it's for Candy, but we know
it's just 'cause

24:24.767 --> 24:26.377
-they want Ricky to win.
-Hello, bitch?

24:26.421 --> 24:28.771
Why am I here if you're
telling the whole story?

24:28.815 --> 24:30.643
-My bad.
-She says,

24:30.686 --> 24:32.558
-it's what Candy would do.
-Man.

24:32.601 --> 24:35.778
Hold on a minute. Did they bringher actual hammer?

24:35.822 --> 24:37.214
-Yes.
-Oh, hell no.

24:42.568 --> 24:43.960
Elektra.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.962
I'm not going to even
ask you if it's true,

24:46.006 --> 24:47.529
'cause I know it is.

24:47.573 --> 24:48.922
Blanca, dear.

24:48.965 --> 24:51.751
I can't imagine what
you're talking about.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.187
If anything happens to my child,

24:53.230 --> 24:54.536
I will kill you.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.801
I wasn't planning on
hobbling him for life.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.108
He's young, wounds heal.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.544
There'll be other
opportunities for him.

25:02.588 --> 25:06.113
Don't you see this is not anopportunity for Damon or Ricky?

25:06.156 --> 25:08.768
They're standing in
for all of us.

25:08.811 --> 25:11.248
You know, you may be
seven feet tall,

25:11.292 --> 25:13.381
hobnobbing with the glitterati,

25:13.424 --> 25:15.775
but no one really sees you.

25:15.818 --> 25:18.952
No one sees any of us.

25:18.995 --> 25:22.738
Not until right now,
this moment.

25:22.782 --> 25:24.958
How are they gonna ignore
any of us when one of our own

25:25.001 --> 25:27.613
is out there dancing in front
of thousands of people?

25:29.615 --> 25:31.138
You know what?

25:31.181 --> 25:33.967
You are one of us.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.709
And the light that those boys
are about to shine our way

25:36.752 --> 25:38.841
is gonna light you up, too.
So give me that

25:38.885 --> 25:41.496
goddamn hammer
and call off these dogs.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.604
You ruin all my plans, mongrel.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.221
Wintours.

26:17.837 --> 26:20.579
PRAY TELL:
The category is Fringe Fever.

26:22.276 --> 26:23.886
I see you feeling fabulous

26:23.930 --> 26:25.801
in all that fringe, Francine.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.719
Looking don't cost nothing.

26:38.771 --> 26:41.469
-Where you been?
-You're mad cute.

26:41.512 --> 26:43.732
-Mm-hmm.
-I've been working doubles,

26:43.776 --> 26:45.865
trying to pull
my own weight, you know?

26:45.908 --> 26:47.693
I feel you.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.825
Work's beena good distraction for me, too.

26:51.261 --> 26:54.569
Especially with...
with all the Candy stuff.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.919
Blanca told me
Ford got you booked.

26:56.963 --> 26:58.834
Mm-hmm.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.751
I booked another
Wet n Wild campaign.

27:02.795 --> 27:04.884
-No.
-And...

27:04.927 --> 27:07.277
Ms. Ford got me
an Essencecover try.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.890
Yo. That's what's up.

27:12.979 --> 27:16.373
we gonna take a rain check
on that dinner.

27:19.855 --> 27:22.771

You look good, girl.

27:55.891 --> 27:57.066
You hear me?

27:57.110 --> 27:59.329
I need to see it
soft and dainty.

27:59.373 --> 28:01.767
And... dramatic.

28:01.810 --> 28:03.638
And severe.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.335
Aw, bring it.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.600
Yeah, baby.
Ooh, I see you, bitch.

28:09.644 --> 28:12.952
With that press and curl, you
will sit by the stove tonight.

28:12.995 --> 28:15.955
With that iron, baby,

28:15.998 --> 28:17.957
You going for that trophy

28:21.612 --> 28:23.179

28:24.877 --> 28:27.793
Ah, oh,
but Mr. Damon Evangelista

28:27.836 --> 28:29.795

to say about that.

28:29.838 --> 28:31.100
He says, "No, ma'am."

28:31.144 --> 28:32.754
"Not tonight, you ain't

28:32.798 --> 28:35.017

from me tonight, honey.

28:35.061 --> 28:37.803
"Nuh-nuh, not, not tonight.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.761
"Oh, you can take
that shit elsewhere,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.458
you ain't snatching my trophy."

28:41.502 --> 28:43.765
He said, "Ooh,

28:43.809 --> 28:45.985
no, ma'am."

28:46.028 --> 28:47.769
Yes, the mess around, bitch.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
Hah! Oh! Hah!

29:00.651 --> 29:02.044
Ricky Wintour.

29:02.088 --> 29:04.612
He's feeling very peevish.

29:04.655 --> 29:06.222
The swirl like Diana, honey.

29:06.266 --> 29:09.617
He didn't come to play
with you hoes tonight.

29:09.660 --> 29:11.053
Oh, Spinderella.

30:20.775 --> 30:22.733
-Don't be mad, bitch.

Children always
wind up paying for

30:26.172 --> 30:27.782
the sins of the mother.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.344
-with Damon?

31:08.388 --> 31:10.520
You're a little

31:10.564 --> 31:13.784
-And messy.
-Oh, that's how it's gon' be?

31:14.960 --> 31:16.918
Ooh.

31:16.962 --> 31:19.181
-Looks like somebody's
game slipping, player.

31:19.225 --> 31:21.183
I'm so glad that I'm here.
You might need a coach.

31:21.227 --> 31:22.968
Please, I invented the game.

31:23.011 --> 31:24.186
Yeah, yeah.

31:26.841 --> 31:28.364
So...

31:28.408 --> 31:30.801

31:32.238 --> 31:33.587
I just wanted

31:33.630 --> 31:35.589
-You don't have to.
-Oh, I know I don't.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.069
But I want to.

31:37.112 --> 31:39.419
You were better

You were really good out there.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.000
And you were good

31:56.131 --> 31:58.220
You gon' get picked
