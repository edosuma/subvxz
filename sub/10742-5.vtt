           And then I'd like you
            to call the airstrip

23:56.802 --> 23:58.736
        and find out what flight
          I'm taking to Nevada.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.070
Oh, yes, sir.
Nevada?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.238
                       Mm-hm.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.340
        Yes, I start training
       for Operation Moondrop.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.441
      Well, what about me?

24:04.476 --> 24:06.309
Oh, you won't have any problems.

24:06.345 --> 24:08.612
     They can always use a good
       secretary around here.

24:08.647 --> 24:11.281
 B-b-but...I am your secretary.

24:11.316 --> 24:12.850
        And I won't need one
          where I'm going.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.251
I resign.

24:14.286 --> 24:15.753
                     Well--
                Well, you can't.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.254
               You just can't.
             There's no way out.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.488
I checked.

24:18.523 --> 24:21.058
They only discharge girls
if they're troublesome,

24:21.093 --> 24:22.226
or a disturbing influence,

24:22.261 --> 24:23.794
or prove incompetent
in their work.

24:23.829 --> 24:25.328
                   [GIGGLES]

24:37.109 --> 24:39.743
                You were saying,
                    master?

24:39.778 --> 24:43.179
I was saying, "Welcome back
to civilian life."

24:47.753 --> 24:51.121
