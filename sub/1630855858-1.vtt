WEBVTT

00:03.041 --> 00:06.000
I hereby arrest you for crimes
against the Sacred Timeline.

00:06.000 --> 00:08.333
How do you plead?

00:11.416 --> 00:14.708
<i>Long ago, the all-knowing
Time-Keepers emerged,</i>

00:14.708 --> 00:18.375
<i>creating and organizing
the Sacred Timeline.</i>

00:18.500 --> 00:21.375
<i>Sometimes, people like you
veer off the path.</i>

00:21.375 --> 00:23.875
<i>We call those Variants.</i>

00:23.875 --> 00:25.416
I'm Agent Mobius, by the way.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.458
How long have you been here?
I don't know.

00:27.458 --> 00:30.500
<i>It's hard to say.
Time passes differently here in the TVA.</i>

00:30.500 --> 00:31.875
<i>I can't go back, can I?</i>

00:32.958 --> 00:37.333
I can't offer you salvation, but maybe
I can offer you something better.

00:37.333 --> 00:40.000
<i>A fugitive Variant's
been killing our Minutemen.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:43.083
<i>The Variant we're hunting is you.</i>

00:43.083 --> 00:45.583
- Trusting this man is not a good idea.
- I can handle him.

00:45.583 --> 00:47.291
The Time-Keepers didn't create you.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.083
They kidnapped you from the timeline!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.666
You were disloyal to the TVA.

00:50.666 --> 00:52.666
HUNTER B-15: <i>You were
in the Time-Keepers' chambers.</i>

00:52.666 --> 00:54.583
<i>They weren't real.
Why'd you think</i>

00:54.583 --> 00:56.708
- that changes anything?
- That changes everything!

00:56.833 --> 00:59.000
Lamentis, The Void.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.625
<i>Every step you took to get here,</i>

01:02.625 --> 01:06.416
I paved the road.

01:06.416 --> 01:09.791
You kill me and destroy all this,
and you don't just have one devil,

01:09.791 --> 01:11.416
you have an infinite amount.

01:11.416 --> 01:15.916
Or you take over
and return to the TVA as its rulers.

01:15.916 --> 01:18.375
- What if he's telling the truth?
- He's a liar, Loki.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.666
I'll see you soon.

01:23.666 --> 01:24.791
<i>Someone is coming.</i>

01:24.791 --> 01:27.833
<i>Countless different versions
of a very dangerous person.</i>

01:27.833 --> 01:30.166
<i>And they're all set on war.
We need to prepare.</i>

01:30.166 --> 01:32.166
<i>Take it easy.
What division are you from?</i>

01:32.166 --> 01:35.625
- What? What are you talking about?
- Who are you? What's your name?

01:35.625 --> 01:38.125
Boots on the ground now. Archives.

02:53.750 --> 02:56.250
Hold it right there, Variant!

02:56.250 --> 02:57.750
What is going on?

02:57.750 --> 02:59.791
Mobius, it's me.

02:59.916 --> 03:01.708
I don't know you.

03:05.625 --> 03:06.625
Hey!

03:36.833 --> 03:39.041
<i>Calm your mind and relax.</i>

03:53.750 --> 03:56.541
I'm fine. I'm fine.

03:56.875 --> 03:58.125
Morning!

04:07.291 --> 04:08.375
She'll be fine.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.041
<i>Level five intruder.</i>

04:27.041 --> 04:30.625
<i>He's hopped into a mail cart
and descended to the lower level.</i>

04:31.375 --> 04:32.416
Casey.

04:34.833 --> 04:36.458
Have we met each other?

04:36.458 --> 04:40.458
Casey, help me.
Please, tell me you know what's going on.

04:40.458 --> 04:42.041
Don't you remember me?

04:45.458 --> 04:47.500
I got him. I got the intruder.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.750
I got the intruder!

05:05.166 --> 05:06.166
Loki.

05:06.833 --> 05:07.916
What?

05:07.916 --> 05:11.291
Just a second ago, you didn't know me.

05:12.208 --> 05:14.583
Casey. Casey.

05:16.958 --> 05:20.208
Casey, something terrible is happening.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.166
I'm being pulled from...

05:25.333 --> 05:26.750
Wait, no.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.375
Has that always been there?

05:33.375 --> 05:36.500
The crack?
It's been there as long as I can remember.

05:36.500 --> 05:37.750
I was in the past.

05:39.791 --> 05:42.541
Where's Mobius? B-15?

05:46.541 --> 05:49.708
They're probably in, uh,

05:49.708 --> 05:53.541
Chrono Bay Three, so...

05:56.666 --> 05:57.666
Loki?

06:19.666 --> 06:23.000
Now what?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.333
HUNTER B-15: Now,
the branches keep on growing

06:25.333 --> 06:29.000
and we tell the people of the TVA
the truth about this place.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.250
And you think people
are gonna be ready to hear that?

06:33.875 --> 06:36.250
HUNTER B-15: People have lives
on the timeline, Mobius.

06:36.250 --> 06:37.458
Yes, I know.

06:37.458 --> 06:39.708
They should have the chance
to live those lives.

06:39.708 --> 06:40.958
Think about it.

06:40.958 --> 06:44.333
Hey, everything you've been doing is wrong
and all your gods are dead.

06:44.333 --> 06:46.583
How are people gonna take that?

06:46.750 --> 06:50.750
HUNTER B-15:
We have to give it a shot.

06:50.750 --> 06:54.375
Hey, Mobius,
Loki was just here looking for you.

06:54.375 --> 06:55.541
Loki's here?

06:55.541 --> 06:58.250
He was, then he disappeared.
- I don't understand.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.208
He disappeared right in front of me.

07:00.208 --> 07:01.750
He looked like he was in pain.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.875
Maybe Miss Minutes can locate him.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.375
You just saw him?

07:06.375 --> 07:07.541
I did.

07:07.541 --> 07:09.208
Miss Minutes? It's not working.

07:09.208 --> 07:10.833
HUNTER X-5: Hey, I have a question.

07:12.916 --> 07:14.833
Can I help you with something, X-5?

07:14.833 --> 07:17.750
We don't see you down here too often.

07:17.750 --> 07:22.000
This one here.
Is this on the Sacred Timeline?

07:22.708 --> 07:24.416
'Cause looks fun.

07:25.416 --> 07:28.833
Jet Skis, Sea-Doos.

07:30.666 --> 07:32.500
Is one of these calling your name, Mobius?

07:32.500 --> 07:35.541
Well, I don't know about calling,

07:36.208 --> 07:38.083
maybe gently whispering.

07:39.291 --> 07:42.416
"Mobius! Come take us for a little spin."

07:42.416 --> 07:44.166
The funny thing about Jet Skis,

07:44.166 --> 07:46.958
everyone thinks that
it's a personal watercraft,

07:46.958 --> 07:49.416
and it's actually a brand,
same way Kleenex is.

07:49.416 --> 07:53.083
Mobius, I don't care.

07:53.083 --> 07:54.166
Why'd you ask?

07:54.166 --> 07:56.833
With Renslayer missing,
there's a new judges' council.

07:56.833 --> 07:59.208
So, General Dox and Judge Gamble

07:59.208 --> 08:02.375
would like to see you both
in the War Room.

08:02.375 --> 08:04.666
I wonder what that's about, huh?

08:22.916 --> 08:25.541
Mobius. Where is he?

08:27.375 --> 08:28.375
He's in the War Room.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.375
HUNTER B-15: We're answering
to the judges' council now?

08:47.375 --> 08:51.125
- Okay, they probably heard the rumors...
- Mob...

08:51.125 --> 08:52.250
What?

08:52.250 --> 08:54.833
Nothing. Let's just ease them into it.

08:54.833 --> 08:57.250
- We're just gonna tell them the truth.
- Agreed, but gently.

08:58.958 --> 09:01.333
- What is that?
- I don't know.

09:08.250 --> 09:10.083
Mobius, I was just doing my job.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.166
You mean pruning me.

09:12.291 --> 09:14.916
Yeah, well, I guess you were
just following orders.

09:14.916 --> 09:18.625
It's actually Renslayer
who really owes me the apology.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.166
What's the mood like in there?

10:12.666 --> 10:14.291
<i>You're all Variants!</i>

10:14.291 --> 10:16.666
<i>Everyone who works at the TVA.</i>

10:17.166 --> 10:20.833
<i>The Time-Keepers didn't create you.
They kidnapped you from the timeline</i>

10:20.833 --> 10:22.791
<i>and erased your memories.</i>

10:25.291 --> 10:27.791
<i>Memories she can access
through enchantment.</i>

10:30.875 --> 10:36.541
<i>So, before this, you had a past,
maybe you had a family, a life.</i>

10:44.125 --> 10:47.416
The branches are growing.
They're way past red line.

10:47.416 --> 10:49.958
And you put out an order to stop pruning.

10:49.958 --> 10:51.791
We just need a moment to explain.

10:51.791 --> 10:53.500
Into the microphone, Hunter.

10:53.500 --> 10:56.625
We are doing this by the book
and on the record.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.458
We just need a moment to explain.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.208
Make it make sense.

11:26.541 --> 11:28.916
<i>You are quite a marvel.</i>

11:31.000 --> 11:32.916
<i>I will be proud to lead with you.</i>

11:35.458 --> 11:37.750
<i>You made a difference in this war.</i>

11:39.833 --> 11:42.583
<i>Thank you for being on my team.</i>

11:56.291 --> 11:57.541
<i>For us.</i>

11:57.541 --> 11:59.875
<i>For All Time.</i>

11:59.875 --> 12:01.125
<i>Always.</i>

12:01.750 --> 12:05.833
<i>Ravonna Renslayer,
you are quite a marvel.</i>

12:06.791 --> 12:09.041
<i>I will be proud to lead with you.</i>

12:09.041 --> 12:13.291
And under whose authority did you make
the call to stop pruning branches?

12:13.291 --> 12:15.750
We didn't have time for proper protocol.

12:15.750 --> 12:19.416
Don't you understand? We're all Variants!

12:19.416 --> 12:20.958
D-90 testified

12:20.958 --> 12:24.041
that he went to the timeline
and saw Renslayer's Variant.

12:24.458 --> 12:28.291
And that would certainly corroborate
what B-15 is saying.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.416
HUNTER B-15: That's right.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.458
Renslayer had a life on the timeline.

12:31.458 --> 12:33.791
- On the record, 15.
- To hell with the record.

12:34.833 --> 12:37.000
You had a life on the timeline.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.333
And so did you.

12:40.541 --> 12:41.625
So did I.

12:41.625 --> 12:44.541
Look, we get the concerns
'cause we had 'em also.

12:44.541 --> 12:48.375
But let's also admit that
the timeline is branching.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.708
The sky hasn't fallen, we're...

12:49.708 --> 12:51.291
HUNTER X-5: What sky are you looking at?

12:51.291 --> 12:55.041
Are you seeing this
robot head on the table?

12:55.041 --> 12:58.416
The sky is falling, Mobius.
This changes everything!

12:58.416 --> 12:59.791
This changes nothing.

13:01.291 --> 13:04.458
We won't let the timeline branch.
I'm sorry, Hunter.

13:04.458 --> 13:08.666
If we don't protect it,
what on earth are you suggesting?

13:08.666 --> 13:12.750
Protect? Is that what you think
we've been doing?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.750
With all due respect, ma'am,

13:15.750 --> 13:19.500
we haven't been protecting,
we've been destroying.

13:20.458 --> 13:23.000
There are people with lives
on those branches,

13:23.000 --> 13:25.375
and we have committed atrocities

13:25.375 --> 13:27.166
every time we prune.
Atrocities?

13:27.166 --> 13:29.083
- Yes.
- Take caution in your tone.

13:29.083 --> 13:32.958
Call it whatever you want, but we have to
take a moment to understand what is...

13:32.958 --> 13:35.625
- We don't have a moment.
- You've made your position clear.

13:35.625 --> 13:37.375
So we don't have time for protocol now?

13:37.375 --> 13:39.708
And you've made
your position clear, Hunter.

13:50.625 --> 13:55.791
All my life, I've always handed down
the same verdict.

13:55.791 --> 13:57.166
Guilty.

13:57.166 --> 14:00.041
The Time-Keepers deemed it so.

14:00.041 --> 14:04.375
HUNTER B-15: Ma'am, I know how hard it is

14:04.375 --> 14:07.250
to turn your back on everything
you've believed in.

14:09.000 --> 14:13.916
But the TVA has to change,
and it has to start now.

14:14.041 --> 14:16.333
We can't go back
to pruning those branches.

14:20.125 --> 14:22.208
I can do anything.

14:29.416 --> 14:30.458
Anything.

14:32.333 --> 14:36.541
Tell the TVA to stop pruning,
effective immediately.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.208
Loki?

14:41.208 --> 14:43.291
Mobius. You know me.
Where the hell were you?

14:43.291 --> 14:44.666
HUNTER X-5: Hey.
Help me.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.125
- HUNTER X-5: Hey!
- What just happened?

14:46.125 --> 14:48.500
A moment ago, you didn't know me.
Stand down!

14:48.500 --> 14:51.125
- Tell me you recognize me. Do you know me?
- Yeah.

14:51.125 --> 14:52.791
Everyone, stand down!

14:54.041 --> 14:56.000
- Come on. Come here.
- Mobius. We found him.

14:56.000 --> 14:57.875
- Who?
- Him.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.208
Loki?

15:05.875 --> 15:07.458
Get back!

15:24.000 --> 15:28.083
That's who built this place!
That's who stole your lives!

15:28.708 --> 15:30.625
That's who's coming back!

15:30.625 --> 15:31.708
Okay.

15:32.708 --> 15:35.125
Easy, put it down.

15:35.125 --> 15:37.291
- Put it down.
- She was going to kill him.

15:37.291 --> 15:38.791
Who, Sylvie?
- Mobius, yes.

15:38.791 --> 15:39.916
Sylvie? Where is she?

15:39.916 --> 15:42.500
- I don't know.
- It's okay. It's all right.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.375
Come.
She kicked me through a Time Door.

15:55.791 --> 15:59.083
The Time-Keepers are fake,
but their warnings were real.

16:00.291 --> 16:02.125
Seems pretty straightforward to me.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.625
What do you want me to do?

16:04.625 --> 16:07.708
We need to know what happened
at the End of Time.

16:07.708 --> 16:08.916
Find Sylvie.

16:08.916 --> 16:11.750
She's the reason we're in this mess.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.791
Who's she? What does she want with Sylvie?

16:19.791 --> 16:21.833
General Dox. Don't worry. Are you okay?

16:21.833 --> 16:24.333
- What happened with the cloud monster?
- Alioth?

16:24.333 --> 16:25.708
Alioth was a distraction.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.458
He was a guard dog. We found him.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.125
A Citadel at the End of Time.

16:29.125 --> 16:31.916
- But where's Sylvie?
- I don't know, she's still there.

16:31.916 --> 16:33.416
I just wanted time to think.

16:33.416 --> 16:35.958
It was an impossible choice,
but she seemed so certain.

16:35.958 --> 16:37.750
How could she be given the consequences?

16:37.750 --> 16:40.458
- I just wanted time to think.
- Okay, slow down, Loki.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.833
You wanted time to think, so, let's think.

16:42.833 --> 16:46.291
It's okay.

16:46.291 --> 16:47.500
Mobius,

16:49.916 --> 16:52.166
we got to the man at the End of Time,

16:53.625 --> 16:54.875
and he made sense.

16:55.625 --> 16:58.208
We thought it was about
freeing the timeline,

16:58.208 --> 17:01.916
but that brings only more malevolence,
more violence, more war.

17:01.916 --> 17:03.458
More of him. They're coming.

17:03.458 --> 17:04.875
- They're all coming.
- Who?

17:04.875 --> 17:07.291
-"You came to kill the devil."
- I don't understand.

17:08.041 --> 17:09.583
Maybe he was.

17:09.583 --> 17:14.166
But maybe he wasn't.
She was convinced he was.

17:16.750 --> 17:20.458
We fought, Mobius,
and she kicked me through a Time Door.

17:20.583 --> 17:23.166
Well, I'd ask who won, but...

17:24.708 --> 17:25.833
It was a draw.

17:26.791 --> 17:30.083
You both kicked each other
through Time Doors simultaneously?

17:30.083 --> 17:32.750
No. I was actively
trying not to fight her.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.833
I was trying to stop her.
She was gonna kill him.

17:34.833 --> 17:36.250
Stop. Relax. Forget about it.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.916
Look, Renslayer kicked me down
some steps, too. Listen, just calm down.

17:39.916 --> 17:42.500
I just wish I had tried harder,
I wish I'd had more time.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.041
Don't do the coulda woulda shoulda.
Focus on what we know.

17:46.083 --> 17:47.083
That.

17:48.333 --> 17:51.666
That is what we know.
War. And it's on its way.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.625
Maybe it's true, everything he was doing,
the pruning,

17:54.625 --> 17:56.375
the preservation of the Sacred Timeline.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.125
It was about preventing more of him.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.916
There was no simple choice, no other way.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.375
- That's who you showed us in there?
- He Who Remains.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.041
This is his kingdom.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.958
And he said he keeps us safe,
but how can you believe that?

18:06.958 --> 18:10.375
- He built this place.
- No, how would I not remember that?

18:10.375 --> 18:12.583
- How could he...
- Because he wiped your memories.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.958
And he obviously did it more than once.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.625
- They have to listen to us.
- Hey!

18:18.625 --> 18:22.125
Believe me, they listened to you, okay?
We heard you loud and clear.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.541
You have to explain to me exactly,

18:24.541 --> 18:28.416
how did you just appear in there?

18:28.416 --> 18:30.416
Did you come straight
from the End of Time?

18:30.541 --> 18:33.083
No, I was in the past.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.083
What do you mean, in the past? Where?

18:36.083 --> 18:38.625
- Here, the past TVA.
- No, there is no past TVA.

18:38.625 --> 18:41.791
- Time doesn't work like that here.
- It does, it's happening to me.

18:41.791 --> 18:44.083
- It's impossible. No, it's not.
- It's possible.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.875
- Did you see it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

18:51.875 --> 18:54.125
Yeah? What does it... How does it look?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.166
It looks... I mean, how does it feel?

18:57.791 --> 19:01.000
It's not that bad.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.416
Really? I mean, it look...

19:04.541 --> 19:07.583
I guess it doesn't look that bad,

19:07.583 --> 19:09.333
but we definitely gotta get you help.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.958
Let me call Miss Minutes.

19:10.958 --> 19:13.000
- No. You can't trust her.
- What?

19:13.000 --> 19:15.125
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.

19:15.125 --> 19:18.541
She was there with him at the End of Time.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.458
No, we gotta get you checked out.

19:22.458 --> 19:25.458
Yeah, let's swing you by
Repairs & Advancement. Come on.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.083
- They'll have a look at you.
- Where's that? I need to get back.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.291
Come on.

19:29.291 --> 19:32.541
We need to deal with
the bigger problem here.

19:32.541 --> 19:35.250
- He Who Remains.
- I understand and we'll get to that.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.875
In order to do that,
I need a Loki Who Remains.

19:37.875 --> 19:39.833
We need to address you disappearing.

19:39.833 --> 19:42.208
What? I don't keep disappearing.
We don't have time...

19:42.208 --> 19:43.416
Loki...

19:46.083 --> 19:47.250
You just disappeared.

19:47.250 --> 19:49.916
I can't keep looking at it
'cause it's horrible.

19:49.916 --> 19:52.416
What? I thought you said
it didn't look that bad.

19:52.416 --> 19:53.583
I was lying.

19:53.583 --> 19:56.000
It's terrible,
looks like you're being born or dying

19:56.000 --> 19:57.291
or both at the same time.

19:57.291 --> 19:59.125
- It's freaking me out.
- It's okay.

19:59.125 --> 20:00.416
It looks really painful.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.708
- It's not that bad. I can handle it.
- Come on. How does it look?

20:08.625 --> 20:11.583
Okay, and Sylvie kicking you through
the Time Door into the past,

20:11.583 --> 20:13.208
that somehow started all this?

20:13.208 --> 20:16.375
All I know is I was in the past.

20:16.375 --> 20:19.791
It was He Who Remains' TemPad,
so maybe that's how it was possible.

20:19.791 --> 20:22.125
Wait, that's who you said
had my memory wiped?

20:22.125 --> 20:23.250
Yes. He Who Remains.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.583
Is that what you're calling him,
or that's his name?

20:25.583 --> 20:26.833
That's how he's introduced.

20:26.833 --> 20:29.625
That's arrogant. It's like
calling yourself "Last Man Standing."

20:29.625 --> 20:31.333
Is it arrogant
if you can back it up?

20:31.333 --> 20:33.041
- Can he back it up?
- Yeah.

20:33.041 --> 20:34.250
That's scary.

20:34.250 --> 20:37.041
- Imagine a million of them.
- I'd rather not.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.416
Where are you taking me?

20:39.416 --> 20:41.833
It's all right,
it's a little off the beaten path.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.916
I have no memory
of having my memory wiped.

20:45.041 --> 20:48.875
You know where you're going?
- Yeah, it's just right up here.

20:55.875 --> 20:58.166
It's been a while
since I've been down here.

20:58.916 --> 21:01.458
Actually, I'm not sure
I've ever been down here.

21:05.791 --> 21:08.500
Oh, hey, welcome to R & A.

21:08.625 --> 21:10.791
Good. We're in the right place.

21:10.791 --> 21:14.041
We have a little bit of a situation
we wanted to run by you.

21:14.750 --> 21:15.875
Mobius!

21:16.666 --> 21:17.708
Wow.

21:17.708 --> 21:19.041
Great to see you again.

21:20.208 --> 21:22.541
Good to see you, too. Yeah, I...

21:23.458 --> 21:25.958
Loki, I wanna introduce you to...

21:28.291 --> 21:29.583
I'm Ouroboros.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.750
- Nice to meet you, Loki.
- Sorry.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.833
Ouroboros.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.625
Ouroboros, hi.
- But he calls me O.B.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.625
Yeah, I call him O.B.

21:36.625 --> 21:38.500
That's a nickname I have. Yeah.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.833
Wow.

21:39.958 --> 21:41.166
How long has it been?

21:41.166 --> 21:44.833
How long has it been? Uh...

21:45.583 --> 21:47.375
Could it be three or four...

21:47.375 --> 21:50.166
- Four hundred years.
- What?

21:50.166 --> 21:52.833
- Feels like a thousand, right?
- Yeah.

21:52.833 --> 21:56.625
Remember, you got off on the wrong floor
and I told you it was the wrong floor...

21:56.625 --> 21:58.333
Wait, that's right! Yes!

21:58.333 --> 22:00.458
I stayed for a little bit.
He took me over...

22:00.625 --> 22:02.333
- You stayed...
- No, you left immediately.

22:05.708 --> 22:07.333
Well, I'm back.

22:07.333 --> 22:09.208
Yes, you are.

22:09.208 --> 22:11.500
Believe it or not, he was my last visitor.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.000
Wow.

22:13.416 --> 22:16.333
- Reunited. Four hundred years.
- Yeah.

22:17.625 --> 22:18.625
That's right. Yeah.

22:18.625 --> 22:21.375
- Hey, how are the other guys doin'?
- What other guys?

22:22.166 --> 22:23.750
- What other guys?
- It's just O.B.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.125
- It's just O.B.
- Yeah. O.B.

22:28.375 --> 22:30.708
- Oh. Hang on.
- Hold on, O.B. Okay.

22:30.708 --> 22:35.000
The work orders really pile up
if I take a break, so I just keep at it.

22:35.000 --> 22:36.958
Forever. No sleep.

22:40.458 --> 22:42.625
O.B., we just have
a quick question for you.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.416
Great being part of a team.

22:53.416 --> 22:55.250
So, how is the team doing up there?

22:55.250 --> 22:57.291
Pretty great. Yeah. I mean, well...

22:58.041 --> 23:01.000
You know about the Time-Keepers
and, you know...

23:02.791 --> 23:04.833
That! That's what's been happening.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.625
Wow. Time slipping.

23:06.625 --> 23:09.291
- What, you... Time... You know that?
- Yeah.

23:09.291 --> 23:10.708
- You've seen that?
- Yeah.

23:10.708 --> 23:12.208
- Can you fix that?
- No.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.958
It's impossible to time slip in the TVA.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.916
I know, but we just saw it happen.

23:18.125 --> 23:21.583
Yeah. I'm having trouble reconciling that.

23:27.375 --> 23:28.666
Ouroboros.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.333
Uh, may I call you "O.B."?

23:31.333 --> 23:32.541
"O.B."?

23:34.083 --> 23:35.125
I like that.

23:35.125 --> 23:37.708
- Uh, do I know you?
- Yes.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.875
In the future. Well, it's your future.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.833
My present. It's complicated.

23:41.833 --> 23:43.291
I've been pulled through

23:43.291 --> 23:45.416
- different times in the TVA...
- Time slipping.

23:45.416 --> 23:46.916
That!

23:46.916 --> 23:49.000
I've been time slipping in the TVA...

23:49.000 --> 23:50.791
It's impossible to time slip in the TVA.

23:50.791 --> 23:52.333
- But you saw it happen.
- Yeah.

23:52.333 --> 23:54.416
I'm having trouble reconciling that.

23:55.500 --> 23:59.125
Looked like your friend was time slipping,
but it must be something else.

23:59.125 --> 24:01.833
I've never seen anything
close to that happen before.

24:03.166 --> 24:04.166
Wait.

24:04.875 --> 24:06.208
No.

24:06.208 --> 24:08.000
There was one time.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.833
That guy that was here? What was his name?

24:09.833 --> 24:11.166
- Loki?
- Yeah.

24:11.166 --> 24:13.958
A long time ago, he came to me
complaining about time slipping.

24:14.541 --> 24:17.750
- How did I not remember that?
- Wait, is he talking to you in the past

24:17.750 --> 24:19.250
and you're just remembering it?

24:19.250 --> 24:22.000
Wow. That makes perfect sense.

24:22.125 --> 24:24.291
- There's no flaw in that logic.
- Yes.

24:24.291 --> 24:27.250
- Time slipping is possible at the TVA.
- Yes. You remember.

24:27.250 --> 24:28.958
- What did you tell him?
- I told him...

24:28.958 --> 24:30.041
That's impossible.

24:30.041 --> 24:33.708
That's not impossible because
I was just with you in the future.

24:33.708 --> 24:35.708
Mmm... I think I would remember that.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.958
Yes, but it hasn't happened to you yet.

24:37.958 --> 24:39.583
- Do you see?
- Good point.

24:39.583 --> 24:43.166
It would be convenient if we were
having this conversation in the future

24:43.166 --> 24:44.416
and this were the past.

24:44.416 --> 24:48.541
We were. This is the... Never mind.

24:48.541 --> 24:50.375
O.B., look, for the sake of argument,

24:51.166 --> 24:54.875
let's just say, if it were possible
to time slip in the TVA,

24:54.875 --> 24:56.291
- how might one...
- It's not.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.166
I understand that.

24:58.583 --> 25:02.500
But theoretically, if it were possible
to time slip in the TVA,

25:02.500 --> 25:04.416
how might one remedy that?

25:04.416 --> 25:07.500
First off, someone in the time
you want to end up in

25:07.500 --> 25:10.125
would need a Temporal Aura Extractor.

25:10.125 --> 25:13.083
- Do you have one of those?
- I do not.

25:16.375 --> 25:17.416
Ha! I got it.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.416
One Temporal Aura Extractor.

25:21.416 --> 25:22.583
Great.

25:22.583 --> 25:25.375
Can you hold onto that
until my friend Mobius drops by?

25:25.375 --> 25:27.916
No. Wait.

25:28.791 --> 25:29.875
Yes?

25:30.875 --> 25:33.125
I actually do have an Extractor here.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.916
One Temporal Aura Extractor.

25:37.916 --> 25:41.333
And did you happen to discuss
how to use such a thing with my friend?

25:41.333 --> 25:43.291
You need to get to the Temporal Loom,

25:43.291 --> 25:46.583
so the Extractor can pull Loki
directly out of the time stream.

25:46.583 --> 25:48.875
Wait, so,
I need to get to the Temporal Loom

25:48.875 --> 25:52.416
so the Extractor can pull Loki
out of the time stream?

25:52.416 --> 25:54.666
- But it could be dangerous.
- How dangerous?

25:54.666 --> 25:56.291
Not too bad if you're quick about it.

25:56.291 --> 25:58.666
- Gotta be quick about it.
- If you spend too long in it,

25:58.666 --> 26:02.333
that kinda temporal energy
will peel the skin right off you.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.833
Wait, you said "not too bad"

26:03.833 --> 26:06.333
and you're talking about me
getting my skin peeled off.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.916
Not too bad compared
to what Loki has to do.

26:08.916 --> 26:10.125
Why, what's Loki gotta do?

26:10.125 --> 26:14.041
Violently rip myself from
every thread of time and space?

26:14.041 --> 26:16.500
- All at once?
- That means prune yourself.

26:17.000 --> 26:19.541
- Why?
- When something is pruned,

26:19.541 --> 26:21.166
it's released from time,

26:21.166 --> 26:23.375
so the hope is that
after you prune yourself,

26:23.375 --> 26:25.458
the Extractor will pull you
into the present.

26:27.625 --> 26:28.875
Of course.

26:29.916 --> 26:30.916
Yeah.

26:32.125 --> 26:34.083
Um... and then if it doesn't do that?

26:34.083 --> 26:37.750
You heard about how if you fall
into a black hole you turn into spaghetti?

26:38.208 --> 26:39.500
- No.
- Good.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.500
The less you know about that, the better.

26:46.916 --> 26:48.166
Damn it!

26:48.166 --> 26:49.791
Hey, Loki's back.

26:49.791 --> 26:51.916
I guess you two are ready to go.

26:51.916 --> 26:54.833
Wait, am I ready
to get my skin peeled off? I don't know.

26:54.833 --> 26:57.458
Am I ready to rip myself
from every thread of time?

26:57.458 --> 26:59.083
I'd rather have that.

26:59.208 --> 27:01.375
You'd rather be disassembled
and never reassembled?

27:01.375 --> 27:02.791
Than have your skin ripped off?

27:02.791 --> 27:04.625
At least you get to live.

27:04.625 --> 27:07.125
Live? What's the quality of life
with no skin?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.583
There has to be another way.

27:12.916 --> 27:16.541
Huh. Been doing that all day.
No, it's not the lamp.

27:16.541 --> 27:18.750
We're having power surges
all through the TVA.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.708
What did you say?

27:37.375 --> 27:39.125
So, the timeline is branching now?

27:39.125 --> 27:41.791
I bet that's what's causing
the power surges.

27:41.791 --> 27:44.458
- And maybe your time slipping.
- Really? How?

27:44.458 --> 27:46.958
Things are a mess upstairs.
This better be important.

27:46.958 --> 27:48.250
It is.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.666
The branching is overloading
the Temporal Loom.

27:50.833 --> 27:52.250
- Temporal Loom?
- That's bad.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.750
You know, the Temporal Loom.

27:53.750 --> 27:56.750
It's in the <i>TVA Guidebook.</i>
The what?

27:58.000 --> 27:59.875
There's one on every desk
at the TVA.

28:00.708 --> 28:03.583
It's a detailed index of
every mechanical classification

28:03.583 --> 28:05.625
and maintenance routine in each sector,

28:05.625 --> 28:09.000
on each device, and inside
every computer program at the TVA.

28:09.666 --> 28:13.708
I wrote it myself.

28:13.708 --> 28:16.958
Okay, O.B.,
this piece just came off right here.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.541
Is that important? I think...

29:07.083 --> 29:09.875
The Temporal Loom is the heart of the TVA.

29:09.875 --> 29:13.625
It's where raw time is refined
into physical timeline.

29:20.375 --> 29:24.250
And it's not constructed to weave together
so many new branches,

29:24.250 --> 29:25.583
so it's overloading.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.125
I've never seen it like this.

29:30.958 --> 29:32.625
It looks like a disaster.

29:33.333 --> 29:34.833
It is a disaster.

29:41.125 --> 29:44.041
You don't get down here too much, I guess.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.333
I never had to.

29:45.333 --> 29:47.291
Miss Minutes took care of everything.

29:47.291 --> 29:49.750
I just ran diagnostics
every few hundred years.

29:49.750 --> 29:52.750
So, O.B., what do we do?
How do we stop it? The meltdown?

29:53.541 --> 29:55.333
We need to prune those extra branches.

29:55.333 --> 29:59.291
That means the death of countless people.
We can't do that.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.250
Then I'll need to close the blast doors
to protect the TVA,

30:03.250 --> 30:05.958
while I figure out how to retrofit it
to handle those branches.

30:05.958 --> 30:08.750
- What about the time slipping?
- Once those doors close,

30:08.750 --> 30:12.333
we won't be able to re-sync you,
so, it's now or never.

30:12.333 --> 30:13.458
What?

30:18.375 --> 30:19.375
Okay.

30:19.375 --> 30:20.500
Now!
Wait!

30:20.500 --> 30:23.000
It's now, but now isn't for a little bit.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.958
We still gotta get Mobius into position.

30:24.958 --> 30:26.291
But first...

30:27.416 --> 30:30.041
Mobius, to fix Loki's time slipping,

30:30.041 --> 30:33.291
you'll go out there
and launch the Extractor,

30:33.291 --> 30:38.000
which will pull Loki from the time stream
before I need to close the blast doors.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.958
Loki, this timer is synced to the Loom.

30:42.250 --> 30:46.875
You'll stand by to prune yourself
within moments after this turns green.

30:47.541 --> 30:51.000
Green means Mobius succeeded.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.583
Green means prune.

30:53.708 --> 30:58.166
If you're too late,
you will be lost to time forever

30:58.166 --> 31:00.958
and Mobius will lose all of his skin.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.208
Okay, you've got about an hour.

31:06.875 --> 31:08.416
You've got about five minutes.

31:08.416 --> 31:10.750
Anyway, I'm gonna get everything ready.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.875
Okay.

31:13.333 --> 31:15.583
Dox and her crew are raiding the armory.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.166
They're going after Sylvie.
That's their only lead.

31:18.291 --> 31:21.416
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing? Where are you going?

31:21.416 --> 31:22.541
- Sylvie, Dox...
- No!

31:22.541 --> 31:24.166
We have one shot at this.

31:24.166 --> 31:25.750
HUNTER B-15: I'll handle Dox.

31:27.166 --> 31:28.166
Good luck.

31:31.250 --> 31:33.541
Mobius, if I...

31:35.250 --> 31:37.458
- If I don't make it back, I...
- You'll make it back.

31:37.458 --> 31:40.875
Right, but when I use this thing,
I might not make it back...

31:54.458 --> 31:56.458
He'll make it back.

32:27.666 --> 32:28.875
It's the future.

32:36.500 --> 32:37.750
The Timestick.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.375
Once these doors open,

32:40.375 --> 32:43.041
the temporal radiation
will start aging away your suit,

32:43.041 --> 32:44.333
so get down the gangway,

32:44.333 --> 32:46.583
lock the Temporal Aura Extractor
into place,

32:46.583 --> 32:48.750
and hoof it back here
the moment I tell you to.

32:48.750 --> 32:51.125
- How am I gonna hoof it in this?
- You got to.

32:52.125 --> 32:53.708
Or what?

32:53.833 --> 32:55.958
Or the blast doors will close
and lock you out.

32:55.958 --> 32:58.666
And then, your suit will age away,
you will age away,

32:58.666 --> 33:02.458
and you'll get very old, and all your skin
will get peeled away, and you will die.

33:06.500 --> 33:08.166
Is this cracked?

33:11.458 --> 33:13.833
- You're good.
<i>- O.B.!</i>

33:13.833 --> 33:17.000
<i>Get ready to see some hoofin'
like you've never seen before.</i>

33:18.083 --> 33:19.083
Okay.

34:12.875 --> 34:17.000
<i>All personnel, report to your
nearest Time Door evacuation point.</i>

34:17.000 --> 34:18.916
The Timestick.

34:19.041 --> 34:22.250
<i>TVA code 1127.</i>

34:22.250 --> 34:26.416
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

34:42.625 --> 34:46.458
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

34:46.458 --> 34:48.250
Come on. The Timestick.

34:50.458 --> 34:53.333
<i>TVA code 1127.</i>

34:53.333 --> 34:54.708
There's still time.

34:54.708 --> 34:58.875
<i>All personnel, report to your nearest
Time Door evacuation point.</i>

35:20.958 --> 35:22.000
<i>Damn it!</i>

35:24.375 --> 35:25.500
<i>Go.</i>

35:34.750 --> 35:35.791
No.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.375
Mobius, I need to
close the blast doors now

35:46.375 --> 35:48.750
<i>to have any hope of fixing the Loom.</i>

35:48.750 --> 35:51.333
<i>Give him more time.
He can still make it.</i>

35:55.000 --> 35:57.500
Mobius, we have 30 seconds.

36:24.375 --> 36:25.500
<i>Five.</i>

36:26.500 --> 36:27.541
Four.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.291
Three.

36:32.041 --> 36:33.166
Three.

36:34.458 --> 36:35.750
<i>Three.</i>

36:35.750 --> 36:37.791
<i>No. Not yet.</i>

36:37.916 --> 36:38.958
<i>Not yet!</i>

36:38.958 --> 36:40.666
<i>Give him more time!</i>

36:40.666 --> 36:42.041
Sorry.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.791
<i>No. No.</i>

36:58.791 --> 37:02.250
<i>Mobius, listen to me.</i>

37:03.041 --> 37:05.791
There is nothing you can do for him.

37:05.791 --> 37:08.708
<i>He's lost to time.</i>

37:28.250 --> 37:30.791
He's not going to make it.

37:39.625 --> 37:42.541
There you are!

38:23.666 --> 38:24.875
We need to find Sylvie.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.041
Where are they going?

38:46.458 --> 38:48.125
All this for Sylvie?

38:51.833 --> 38:53.125
HUNTER D-90: I don't buy it.

42:01.125 --> 42:02.166
How do I do this?

42:02.583 --> 42:03.583
What would you like?

42:03.583 --> 42:05.500
Not squirrel, not possum, not rats.

42:05.500 --> 42:08.458
Something that's already dead,
and nothing with a face.

42:08.458 --> 42:09.625
Please.

42:10.875 --> 42:13.166
You can try our new Chicken McNuggets,

42:13.291 --> 42:16.375
and we have a Big Mac, Filet-O-Fish,

42:16.375 --> 42:19.708
and a hamburger, cheeseburger.

42:19.833 --> 42:23.750
I quite like the Quarter Pounder,
which you can try with or without cheese.

42:30.708 --> 42:32.250
I wanna try everything.

42:34.916 --> 42:35.916
Okay.
