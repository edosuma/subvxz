00:14.723 --> 00:16.558
I'm Jimmy DiResta, and I'm a maker.

00:16.641 --> 00:19.352
That's a hip way of saying
I make things… like this.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.562
Pretty cool, right?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.105
Walk with me.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.442
For years, I made my name
as a toy designer in New York City.

00:25.525 --> 00:29.446
Then I realized I don't like the city,
I don't like designing toys,

00:29.529 --> 00:32.198
and to be honest with you,
I don't really like kids.

00:32.282 --> 00:33.825
It's not like I hate them or anything.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.536
It's just it's,
"Check out my little Timmy."

00:36.619 --> 00:37.454
I don't care.

00:37.996 --> 00:38.997
Look at my birds.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.751
So anyway, I quit my job,

00:42.834 --> 00:46.171
I left the city,
and I moved upstate to here, my farm.

00:46.254 --> 00:48.757
I got land, I got animals,

00:49.340 --> 00:51.384
and best of all I have this.

00:51.468 --> 00:53.970
The ultimate maker workshop!

00:54.471 --> 00:58.892
Inside, I have every kind of tool
and machine imaginable to make things.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.895
Pretty impressive stuff, huh?

01:02.937 --> 01:06.316
Really? You're labeling the table
like that's some sort of impress--

01:06.399 --> 01:07.901
"Bag"? We can just--

01:07.984 --> 01:10.403
Okay. Graphics guy trying to be funny.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.781
Can we please get on with it? Anyway…

01:12.864 --> 01:15.825
So I got a call to be on a TV show
because I'm a maker celebrity or whatever.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.161
I said, "Sure. Cool." Why not, right?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.329
So I agreed.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.956
Then I found out who I'd be working for.

01:22.040 --> 01:22.957
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:23.041 --> 01:24.375
<i>-Hi.</i>
<i>-Hi!</i>

01:24.459 --> 01:25.376
<i>Jimmy!</i>

01:25.460 --> 01:26.294
<i>Hey, Jimmy.</i>

01:26.377 --> 01:27.504
What do you want?

01:27.587 --> 01:29.380
<i>Okay, Mr. Grouch.</i>

01:30.590 --> 01:35.053
Thirty years of expert build experience,
and I'm taking orders from half-pints.

01:35.136 --> 01:38.556
Because misery loves company,
I brought my buddies in on it with me.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.474
Say hi, guys.

01:39.557 --> 01:40.391
-Howdy!
-Hello!

01:40.475 --> 01:43.645
That's Jackman.
He's an engineer, and he plans everything.

01:43.728 --> 01:45.563
It's really annoying, but he's good at it.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.148
That's Derek, my best friend.

01:47.732 --> 01:50.443
Big guy and even bigger softie.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.403
This is Graz.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.280
Good maker, bad jokes.

01:54.781 --> 01:55.824
And Canadian Pat.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.369
Well, your guess is as good as mine.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.453
Let's have some fun.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.501
Together, we'll take pitches on this.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.170
Listen to whatever
their dumb little brains come up with.

02:09.254 --> 02:11.422
<i>The Pig Tripper. It trips the pig.</i>

02:11.506 --> 02:14.175
-Wow.
-So a catapult that throws cat poop.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.052
-<i>Yes.</i>

02:16.136 --> 02:19.222
If it's interesting or doable,
I'll build it. If not--

02:19.305 --> 02:20.265
Next!

02:20.348 --> 02:21.516
-Next!
<i>-No way.</i>

02:21.599 --> 02:23.143
-Next!
<i>-Shut up!</i>

02:23.226 --> 02:24.936
-Some builds will be good.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.855
Dino Taco Toilet.

02:26.938 --> 02:28.439
Are you not entertained?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.108
Some builds will be bad.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.443
Graz, I told you
the scissors were gonna be too heavy!

02:32.527 --> 02:33.570
Make a bigger handle!

02:33.653 --> 02:35.780
But all of them
will be absolutely pointless.

02:35.864 --> 02:37.907
-<i>Yeah!</i>
<i>-That is disgusting.</i>

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Whoa!

02:41.411 --> 02:44.622
-<i>I want the unicorn to fart!</i>
-I can't believe I'm doing this.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.124
-Go, Graz!

02:46.958 --> 02:49.878
Why are we doing this?
Because we make things. That's what we do.

02:49.961 --> 02:52.922
-Thought we weren't supposed to have fun.
-I'm not having fun!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.717
We're gonna show these kids,
if they can dream it up…

02:55.800 --> 02:58.803
<i>I want it to be a guitar boat that floats.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.013
You're onto something there.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.681
…it can be built.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.017
<i>Oh!</i>

03:04.100 --> 03:05.685
<i>That is so cool!</i>

03:05.768 --> 03:07.770
Hey. It might even
inspire them to build

03:07.854 --> 03:09.939
outside their little <i>Minecraft</i> -y world,
or whatever.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.816
-Do I wanna do it?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.401
Dumbest thing we've ever made.

03:13.484 --> 03:16.571
Not really.
But this isn't about me, is it?

03:16.654 --> 03:18.781
-So here we are.
-<i>You better get to work!</i>

03:18.865 --> 03:20.909
Funny how their dreams are my nightmare.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.245
Come on, Jimmy. Have some fun.

03:24.329 --> 03:25.163
Whatever.

03:38.176 --> 03:39.510
Good morning!

03:39.594 --> 03:40.762
-Morning!
-What's up?

03:40.845 --> 03:43.223
You guys ready? Come on up.
We got some kids to meet.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.226
-So let's see what we got.
-Here we go.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.188
-Hey, guys, can you hear me?
-<i>Yes.</i>

03:50.271 --> 03:52.190
-What's going on with you, buddy?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.983
From the young lady first,
what's your name?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.360
<i>My name is Kenzie.</i>

03:55.443 --> 03:56.444
<i>My name is Wyatt.</i>

03:56.527 --> 03:57.570
<i>I'm Keifer.</i>

03:57.654 --> 03:59.405
Kenzie, Wyatt, and…

03:59.489 --> 04:01.491
Are you guys using a potato
as a microphone?

04:01.574 --> 04:03.201
<i>Yep, we actually are.</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:06.037
Do you have ideas you wanna pitch me?

04:06.120 --> 04:07.288
<i>-A mansion.</i>
-Whoo!

04:08.039 --> 04:09.540
Do explain.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.709
<i>Outside, it would be all white.</i>

04:11.793 --> 04:15.380
<i>-On the inside, it would have a kitchen.</i>
-Okay.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.547
<i>Like a normal house.</i>

04:16.631 --> 04:17.465
I'm sold.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.801
-Do you have an invention?
<i>-Yes. We do</i> <i>actually.</i>

04:19.884 --> 04:20.718
Let's see it.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.513
<i>So, basically, our invention's</i>
<i>something called a Tutor Bot.</i>

04:23.596 --> 04:26.516
-Right.
<i>-And we named the Tutor Bot "Sasha."</i>

04:26.599 --> 04:30.061
<i>The Tutor Bot's purpose</i>
<i>is to help you with your homework.</i>

04:30.144 --> 04:31.729
<i>She wakes you up in the morning.</i>

04:31.813 --> 04:34.023
<i>She has an alarm clock. She can tell time.</i>

04:34.107 --> 04:36.609
So you guys basically made a giant iPhone?

04:37.443 --> 04:40.571
<i>Yeah. But, actually, I didn't think</i>
<i>about it like that but yes.</i>

04:45.034 --> 04:45.868
Pitch me.

04:45.952 --> 04:49.038
<i>My first idea was a car</i>
<i>that can turn into a boat.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:51.082
Wait. So you invented a duckboat?

04:51.165 --> 04:53.042
Boston called. They want their idea back.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.877
<i>And then there's a walking plane.</i>

04:55.461 --> 04:56.546
A walking plane?

04:56.629 --> 04:57.964
A walking plane?

04:58.047 --> 05:00.591
<i>-A walking plane.</i>
Hold on. I'm considering that.

05:02.385 --> 05:03.928
-Um…

05:05.471 --> 05:09.350
<i>It would have… a TV.</i>

05:09.976 --> 05:11.185
<i>Um…</i>

05:11.894 --> 05:14.814
<i>And it has a cupholder in the bed.</i>

05:14.897 --> 05:16.149
Ten more seconds.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.568
<i>Um…</i>

05:19.277 --> 05:20.153
<i>That's it.</i>

05:20.987 --> 05:22.405
"Make a TV show," they said.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.866
"It's gonna be fun.
It's gonna be called <i>Making Fun."</i>

05:24.949 --> 05:25.825
Next!

05:27.410 --> 05:29.787
Do these guys look
like they can do electronics?

05:29.871 --> 05:33.166
These are the guys you call
when you have a clogged toilet.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.001
<i>Yeah. I can tell.</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:37.211
Next.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.256
Aw!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.842
A boat that's a car,
and an airplane that has feet.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.093
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Let's try this.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.888
Come on. Do it with me. One, two, three.

05:46.971 --> 05:49.015
Pull it in and go, "Next!"

05:49.098 --> 05:49.932
<i>Ne--</i>

05:53.478 --> 05:54.437
Bye-bye.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.439
Let's go. Come on.

05:56.522 --> 05:58.441
-Oh my God.

05:58.524 --> 05:59.484
What in the…

05:59.567 --> 06:01.652
Looks like an episode
of <i>American Horror Story.</i>

06:02.945 --> 06:04.989
-There we go!
-There you go!

06:05.615 --> 06:07.450
You got a great smile there.

06:07.533 --> 06:08.534
Beautiful smile.

06:08.618 --> 06:09.911
What's your name?

06:09.994 --> 06:13.456
<i>My name is Jemmie,</i>
<i>and I am seven years old.</i>

06:13.539 --> 06:15.249
Jemmie? My name is Jimmy.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.292
<i>Hi, Jimmy.</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:17.210
Jimmy-Jemmie.

06:17.710 --> 06:20.254
So, Jemmie, you got me here,
what is your pitch?

06:20.338 --> 06:23.216
<i>I want you to make me a unicorn.</i>

06:23.299 --> 06:24.133
<i>A big one.</i>

06:24.759 --> 06:26.427
-Okay.
<i>-And a bike.</i>

06:27.261 --> 06:29.972
-Wha--
-Does the unicorn ride the bicycle or…

06:30.056 --> 06:31.015
<i>Yes!</i>

06:31.099 --> 06:32.266
Interesting.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.976
<i>And flap its wings.</i>

06:34.477 --> 06:36.896
-Flaps its wings?
You writing this down?

06:36.979 --> 06:38.606
Let me ask you another question--

06:38.689 --> 06:40.358
<i>There's two bicycles.</i>

06:40.441 --> 06:41.818
Two bi… Wait a minute.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.821
So you want two unicornacycles?

06:44.904 --> 06:45.780
<i>Yes!</i>

06:45.863 --> 06:48.324
<i>-Deux. Deux.</i> Yup. <i>Deux.</i>
-<i>Deux?</i> Yeah.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.035
I think you're getting a little greedy
with the two unicornacycles

06:51.119 --> 06:52.829
and all this wings and everything.

06:52.912 --> 06:55.081
-What are they gonna do?
<i>-A unicorn race.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:56.541
Interesting.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.001
Yeah. That's kind of fun.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.505
So two unicorns,
two bicycles, they race each other?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.799
<i>-Yes!</i>
-I actually like this idea.

07:04.882 --> 07:05.967
You know what that means?

07:06.050 --> 07:08.594
-That means I'm deeply disturbed.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.888
Compared to the others,
this is the least stupid.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.181
<i>Thank you.</i>

07:12.265 --> 07:14.267
And something we can make. No electronics.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.977
-We can do it.
-Yeah.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.147
All right, Jemmie.
We'll make two unicornacycles for you.

07:19.230 --> 07:22.650
With all the colors,
all the accessories, the wings,

07:22.733 --> 07:25.319
and everything you want. Is that okay?

07:26.946 --> 07:28.865
<i>-Yes! Yes!</i>
-You guys okay with that?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.993
You go back
to the carnival behind you and have fun.

07:32.076 --> 07:33.870
We'll check in a little later.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.330
<i>-Bye! Have a nice day!</i>
-Bye!

07:36.414 --> 07:37.790
We'll do that.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.417
<i>I'm watching you!</i>

07:40.126 --> 07:41.377
<i>Adios!</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:42.837
Adios.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.256
-Unicorns riding bicycles.
-I love it!

07:45.339 --> 07:47.049
Anybody have any ideas?

07:47.717 --> 07:48.718
What's your idea?

07:48.801 --> 07:51.262
If I'm not on your team,
I'm not telling you my idea.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.555
Why not?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.515
This is obviously a competition.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.811
Hold on. If it's a competition,
I wanna be on Jimmy's team.

07:58.895 --> 08:00.855
-'Cause he's probably gonna win.
-There you go.

08:02.815 --> 08:04.484
So it's us three versus you two.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.236
All right. Let's get started.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.279
Giddyup!

08:08.362 --> 08:10.239
Unicorn-a-competition.

08:18.039 --> 08:21.125
Unicorn cycle.
We're gonna get a bicycle. Right?

08:21.209 --> 08:23.127
Shh. We don't want them to hear.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.800
Whatever they come up with
is gonna be pure…

08:29.884 --> 08:32.970
-She said she wanted a unicornacycle.
-Yep.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.722
Do you have a bike in mind
we're gonna use--

08:34.805 --> 08:36.599
We got a bunch of junk bikes.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.226
I say we cut it in half.

08:38.309 --> 08:40.770
-I'm thinking a tandem. Yeah?
-Ooh!

08:40.853 --> 08:42.480
Make it a little longer.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.899
Cut the whole back
of the first bike off.

08:44.982 --> 08:47.318
We'll add more steel
for reinforcement to the frame.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.529
So it's structurally enough
for both of us.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.155
-Yeah.
-Thick boys.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.868
And so, we'll wrap the frame of the bike

08:55.952 --> 08:58.496
with this foam rubber horse structure.

08:58.579 --> 08:59.413
Okay.

08:59.497 --> 09:02.833
Then we'll wrap that with a plush,
like a stuffed animal.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.963
I heard them saying something about plush.
We should go to the opposite side of that.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.840
Agreed. Plywood or pallet wood, maybe?

09:09.924 --> 09:11.968
Yeah.
Like a Trojan Horse sorta thing.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.638
Then we take the front wheel,
and we make like a horsey trot mechanism.

09:16.639 --> 09:19.100
-I keep saying "horse," but what I mean--
-Unicorn.

09:19.183 --> 09:21.811
Unicorn. But what is not
a unicorn except a…

09:21.894 --> 09:23.062
A fancy horse.

09:23.145 --> 09:24.855
-Fancy horse with a horn.
-Exactly.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.066
Does that look like a horse?

09:27.149 --> 09:28.568
Oh yeah. Don't forget the…

09:29.235 --> 09:30.820
Now it's a unicorn.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.321
He's gonna be in motion.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.531
Both legs gonna be moving?

09:33.614 --> 09:36.117
Yeah. Back legs will be going like this.
Front legs like this.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.744
-Okay. Now that you said it that way.
-Yeah.

09:38.828 --> 09:40.663
Jimmy said something
about making the legs move,

09:40.746 --> 09:42.540
so let's make the head move instead.

09:42.623 --> 09:45.167
-That's what I was picturing.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.129
The horn, I think
we could probably pour up some resin.

09:48.212 --> 09:49.714
We can make it from resin.

09:49.797 --> 09:51.841
-Maybe some sparkles.
-All the colors.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.885
-You can turn it on a lathe.
-Give it a little twist action.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.391
-I think it's good.
-What's up, guys?

10:00.474 --> 10:03.811
Hey, wouldn't it be a shame
if one of your bikes got a flat tire?

10:06.022 --> 10:10.026
Me, Graz, and Derek are gonna
make a plush unicornacycle for one

10:10.109 --> 10:11.235
with moving legs.

10:11.319 --> 10:14.697
Pat and I are gonna make
a tandem unicorn bike with a wooden body.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.532
We'll call it our "Trojan Unicorn."

10:23.080 --> 10:24.457
-Nice!
-Look at that!

10:24.540 --> 10:26.459
Look at these bikes he's got.
I love it.

10:30.087 --> 10:31.380
This is good stuff.

10:32.548 --> 10:33.507
I see potential.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.734
What are we doing? What's the plan?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.694
First thing is to make
the frame bigger.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.948
We're gonna cut the frame and extend it
so that the unicorn has more presence.

10:58.032 --> 11:00.117
-All right. Let's do this.

11:02.119 --> 11:03.371
-That's cut through.
-Yep.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.998
This bike's too short
to support the body of the unicorn,

11:06.082 --> 11:07.917
and to support anybody who rides it.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.043
All right.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.212
Even someone as tiny as Graz.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.089
Let's go 39 for funsies.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.007
We're gonna create an extended frame

11:15.091 --> 11:18.052
by welding one-inch metal stock
to each end of the bike.

11:22.473 --> 11:25.184
That's the welding scribble
that I like. You hear that?

11:26.435 --> 11:27.269
Weld-done.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.490
That's the front bike.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.409
We'll put that up here.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.203
Since we didn't have a tandem bicycle
in the scrap pile,

11:44.286 --> 11:46.997
we have to make our own. We're gonna
attach two bike frames together.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.208
We'll cut it off right around there.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.335
That'll get welded up here on this tube

11:51.419 --> 11:53.921
and then weld that to here
after we grind the paint off.

11:54.004 --> 11:54.839
Okay.

11:54.922 --> 11:57.842
One working in tandem
with the other, just like me and Pat.

11:57.925 --> 11:58.968
Time for my favorite part.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.429
-Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
-I think I am.

12:02.012 --> 12:05.141
Cut! Grind! Weld!

12:06.600 --> 12:07.435
<i>Cut!</i>

12:07.518 --> 12:09.270
First,
we'll cut the front fork off,

12:09.353 --> 12:11.480
which will be the back-half
of our tandem bike.

12:11.564 --> 12:12.398
<i>Cut!</i>

12:13.816 --> 12:15.109
<i>Let's grind!</i>

12:15.192 --> 12:18.612
Next, we'll grind down the areas
where we'll fuse the bikes together.

12:18.696 --> 12:19.655
<i>Let's grind!</i>

12:21.282 --> 12:22.116
<i>Let's weld!</i>

12:22.199 --> 12:25.077
Finally, we'll weld
the back frame to the front frame,

12:25.161 --> 12:28.956
using a welding torch that creates
a liquid metal that's hotter than lava.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.166
<i>Weld!</i>

12:31.083 --> 12:32.251
Whoo!

12:32.334 --> 12:33.961
It's coming together quick.
We're catching up.

12:34.044 --> 12:37.089
Right? Looks nice.
Looks like a "friends" bike.

12:37.173 --> 12:39.091
-Friends?
-Friends.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.009
Friends.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.472
I never knew
that I was gonna be in the toy business

12:44.555 --> 12:45.931
until my final year of college.

12:46.015 --> 12:48.726
I met a teacher who inspired me,
and he encouraged me.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.937
He said, "You have
a very good mind for inventing stuff."

12:52.021 --> 12:54.440
He got me in the toy business
because he was a toy inventor.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.026
-So he gave me projects to develop.
-Like what?

12:57.109 --> 12:59.695
Do you guys remember
a thing called Sky Dancer?

12:59.779 --> 13:00.821
Yeah. Totally.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.448
<i>Sky Dancers!</i>

13:03.741 --> 13:05.034
<i>They're flying!</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:10.915
<i>Wow! They really fly…</i>

13:10.998 --> 13:12.458
Yeah. I had that as a kid.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.046
You had one?

13:18.506 --> 13:20.633
-I helped design that toy.
-So say "thank you."

13:20.716 --> 13:22.092
I loved that thing.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.762
All right. Playtime's over. Step back.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.388
Dad's yelling at us again.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.933
Because we extended it,
we're bringing the seat forward,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.019
so that the center of gravity
isn't shifted too far back.

13:32.102 --> 13:34.230
We just installed a seat pole here.

13:35.731 --> 13:37.733
We're also popping in
an extra pair of handlebars

13:37.817 --> 13:41.320
on top of the ones that already exist
for easier steering and balance.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.947
Wanna give it a shot?

13:43.030 --> 13:45.241
This way. Onto the ground.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.575
Just put it there.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.660
Look at that now.

13:47.743 --> 13:50.412
There's only one person
to take it for a little tour.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.331
-Jimmy! Jimmy!
-Jimmy! Jimmy!

13:52.414 --> 13:53.707
-Jimmy!

13:55.292 --> 13:58.212
I'll be respectful of my elders
and give him a little push.

13:58.295 --> 14:00.798
'Cause I love you.
Pedal hard, brother. Pedal hard.

14:00.881 --> 14:02.591
Little Jimmy's all grown up.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.386
He's trying to act
like he's not having fun.

14:05.469 --> 14:07.972
I thought we weren't supposed to have fun
on these builds!

14:08.055 --> 14:09.265
I'm not having fun!

14:09.765 --> 14:11.725
Besides having to make a unicorn,

14:11.809 --> 14:14.728
I have to make its legs
look like it's galloping.

14:14.812 --> 14:18.107
We need to come up with a way
to power the unicorn's legs

14:18.190 --> 14:19.984
using the bicycle's wheels.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.904
I'm just trying to think of a subtle thing
that uses the action of the wheels.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.823
I need to do something that's gonna…

14:27.449 --> 14:31.161
The problem is that everything has
to be held from the middle or the side.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.415
-I can't put something here. It'll hit.
-Yeah. It's gonna go…

14:34.498 --> 14:36.333
It'll come to me. I'm just…

14:43.424 --> 14:44.633
I got it!

14:44.717 --> 14:46.844
We have a light bulb
we can put on in post?

14:46.927 --> 14:49.138
-What are you thinking?
-I just thought of it.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
-It's an aha moment!
-<i>Aha!</i>

14:52.975 --> 14:54.602
My magic finger.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.145
Right here, there's a wheel.

14:57.021 --> 15:00.900
And on this side of the wheel,
there's a pin pivot here, off-center.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.319
And then on this side,
there's a pin pivot opposite it.

15:03.402 --> 15:06.405
So now, we're attached
to the wheel here and here.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.615
There's no center!

15:07.698 --> 15:10.910
Tell the artist to take
the center circle out. There's no circle.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.579
So when the wheel spins,
this is gonna go like this.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.290
Oh!

15:16.373 --> 15:18.083
But we're on a parallelogram.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.628
So it's gonna go
up and down perfectly like this,

15:20.711 --> 15:22.171
but it'll kind of go like this.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.839
-Got it?
-No.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.592
All right.
If you let me make it, you'll understand.

15:28.802 --> 15:30.012
Cut to the montage.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.987
Here we are. This is the part
we just made on the lathe.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.530
When the wheel turns,

15:48.614 --> 15:51.825
this is gonna create the galloping motion.

15:51.909 --> 15:54.453
We're gonna tie this to the knees of the…

15:55.871 --> 15:56.872
unicorn.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.540
-That'll work.
-It'll go like that.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.458
Nice.

16:05.839 --> 16:09.635
I'm using a blow torch to heat up
the steel rod to make it bendable.

16:09.718 --> 16:11.136
Throw me a tack right on there.

16:11.220 --> 16:14.890
So I can create a metal fork
that will wrap around the center groove

16:15.891 --> 16:18.102
and hold the wheel in place
over the rubber tire.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.145
It's gonna work great.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.484
We designed a few piston-like rods

16:25.567 --> 16:28.112
that will attach
to the knobs on the wheel.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.446
Oh, look at that.

16:31.323 --> 16:35.035
This will create the up-and-down motion
that will power the unicorn's legs.

16:38.288 --> 16:39.915
-You hear that squeak?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.501
That's my elbow
patting myself on the back.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.339
It's making me smile.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.259
See?
Add a little gizmocity. He loves it.

16:50.342 --> 16:53.470
Once we know
where the unicorn's knees are gonna be,

16:53.554 --> 16:56.640
we'll tack weld some braces
on here to grab them and…

16:56.724 --> 16:57.933
Give it the locomotion?

16:58.017 --> 17:01.395
Take advantage of that action.
But now we gotta do this on the back.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.858
So we have a tandem bike.

17:05.941 --> 17:09.194
So next, we gotta work on the body,
and here is what I'm thinking.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.073
The main structure are these ribs here.

17:15.492 --> 17:18.871
And then the outside
will be covered in pallet slats.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.915
-So let's start building the body.
-Good. Let's do that.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.459
We'll go six and a half feet?

17:23.542 --> 17:27.171
To build our wooden unicorn torso,
we'll need to create the ribcage.

17:27.254 --> 17:29.048
Twenty-six inches wide at the knee.

17:29.131 --> 17:32.384
Since Pat and I will be pedaling
inside the body of the unicorn,

17:32.468 --> 17:34.762
we need to make sure
that these thick boys can fit.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.263
Am I wider? I'm probably wider.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.514
We're gonna die.

17:38.098 --> 17:40.350
Next,
we'll take this plywood board

17:40.434 --> 17:42.519
and use the band saw
to carve out our ribs.

17:42.603 --> 17:43.604
-Ribs.
-Ribs.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.860
Yeah. That'll fit nicely.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.153
We need to make more.

18:08.420 --> 18:09.797
Whoa-oa-oa!

18:10.964 --> 18:13.592
We'll attach the ribs
to a long wood spine

18:13.675 --> 18:15.260
to hold them all in place.

18:25.312 --> 18:26.814
Hey, guys, I gotta pee,

18:26.897 --> 18:29.108
but we'll see you after a commercial.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.567
-Bye. Yeah?
-Pat, Pat, Pat.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.361
-We don't have commercials.
-Okay.

18:32.444 --> 18:33.946
-You can't pee.
-I really gotta pee.

18:34.029 --> 18:37.533
-You can't. We don't have commercials.
-Okay. I'm gonna pee in my pants now.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.747
-Yeah?
-Good job!

18:45.624 --> 18:47.793
-So we have a unicorn ribcage here.
-Yeah.

18:47.876 --> 18:50.379
-Grab the pallet slats. Put skin on this.
-Cool.

19:02.558 --> 19:03.433
Um…

19:03.517 --> 19:06.145
I think I know the answer,
but do you have a plan about the body?

19:09.690 --> 19:11.066
Come take a look.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.862
What I see is creating the body
out of foam rubber.

19:18.949 --> 19:20.742
Once we have the body shape cut out,

19:20.826 --> 19:23.412
we'll spray down the edges
with contact cement

19:23.495 --> 19:26.707
and connect the left and right sides
so we can drape it over the bikes.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.960
-Does that look like a horse?
-It looks like a fileted chicken.

19:30.043 --> 19:31.003
Let's try this.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.298
-Ooh!
-Ba-bam!

19:34.381 --> 19:36.341
-Look at that.
-It's not bad!

19:36.425 --> 19:39.928
I was winging it and I got nervous.
I didn't know what I was gonna do.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.138
He finally admits it.

19:41.221 --> 19:43.098
We can start putting his butt together.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.354
Didn't think I'd be blowing
on a unicorn's rear end right now

19:49.438 --> 19:51.148
but gotta let the glue dry.

19:51.231 --> 19:54.484
Now that we have
the headless and legless unicorn filet,

19:54.568 --> 19:58.197
I'm dying to know if the pistons we
created will get these drumsticks moving.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.867
If I get some speed…

20:04.286 --> 20:05.162
This thing…

20:05.245 --> 20:08.332
Did she ask for a dancing unicorn
or a twerking unicorn?

20:08.415 --> 20:10.417
Honestly, this is a good start.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.337
I say, we pop this off,
I keep building the body,

20:13.420 --> 20:15.380
but I want the bike to be painted pink.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.634
If the bike's pink and the body's white,
I think it's gonna look great.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.177
So you do the body, we do the paint?

20:20.260 --> 20:21.511
-Nice.
-We got this.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.019
This is a pallet,
and the plan is to tear these apart.

20:29.102 --> 20:31.396
We're gonna use the slats,
this part of the pallet,

20:31.480 --> 20:34.858
for outside skin
on the body of the unicorn.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.444
-You wanna help me take these apart?
-No.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.403
Friends?

20:38.487 --> 20:41.406
Friends. That's true.
Yeah, yeah, I'll help you.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.205
-You ready?
-Yeah.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.499
I'm a pretty big pallet guy.

20:51.375 --> 20:55.504
First of all, they're usually free.
Businesses use them for shipping.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.005
Wow, it's quick.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.174
But they're built
from high-quality wood,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
so they're perfect for makers like us.

21:01.969 --> 21:04.012
These aren't very rusty either.
These are new pallets.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.891
I chose these pallets
because they're made up of pine.

21:07.975 --> 21:11.937
Pine is light. So this will keep
our unicorn light and nimble.

21:12.020 --> 21:13.230
That's how we do it.

21:28.328 --> 21:30.455
All right. Pick your poison.

21:39.131 --> 21:42.301
You know how they usually
put music and fast cuts to a video

21:42.384 --> 21:43.969
to like, get through the build?

21:44.052 --> 21:44.886
Yeah.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.180
What do you think they're gonna do
for this unicornacycle?

21:47.264 --> 21:50.225
I don't know.
I think something Jimmy would like.

21:57.316 --> 22:00.319
Do you think Jimmy had
a pretty bike like this when he was a kid?

22:00.402 --> 22:04.239
Absolutely. I think he's projecting
what kind of bike we're making now

22:04.323 --> 22:06.325
for the one that he rode as a child.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.286
I'm not having fun!

22:09.369 --> 22:11.538
I don't know if he ever really was a kid.

22:11.621 --> 22:13.999
I think he was always an old grumpy man.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.918
They're like,
"Jimmy, wanna play hopscotch?"

22:17.002 --> 22:20.422
He'd be like, "No. I'm gonna go
in the shop and go build some stuff."

22:20.505 --> 22:22.799
"You don't wanna go
to the store and get candy?"

22:23.383 --> 22:25.635
"No! I'm gonna go build a car."

22:26.303 --> 22:27.512
"All I do is build stuff."

22:27.596 --> 22:29.723
"You know where
my father took me on vacation?"

22:29.806 --> 22:32.893
-Where?
-"A factory. To make stuff."

22:34.436 --> 22:36.396
While I kept Derek
and Graz distracted

22:36.480 --> 22:38.357
by giving them the easiest job possible,

22:38.440 --> 22:41.902
I whipped up our unicorn head using
the same foam that we used on the body.

22:41.985 --> 22:43.612
I'm just flying here.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.739
Nice size. Great proportion.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.449
Horses' eyes scare me.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.452
-Really?
-They're all veiny and creepy-looking.

22:50.535 --> 22:52.996
Every time I see a horse,
and I look in its eye,

22:53.080 --> 22:56.583
it looks like a human
inside of a suit saying, "Save me."

22:56.666 --> 22:59.336
"Help. Call the police. Help." Yeah.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.338
I feel like
it's looking at me saying,

23:01.421 --> 23:04.383
"All you have to do is me on the lips,
and I'll turn back into a prince."

23:04.466 --> 23:05.592
That got weird but yeah.

23:05.675 --> 23:08.512
Now that I have
the unicorn flesh fleshed out…

23:09.096 --> 23:10.680
-"Graz?"

23:10.764 --> 23:13.141
…we gotta make
this monstrosity lovable.

23:13.225 --> 23:17.479
We'll do that by adding a couple of layers
of soft, white, downy-fresh plush cloth.

23:17.562 --> 23:20.774
So we could start spray gluing this
in place, then hot-glue in the seam.

23:20.857 --> 23:22.109
That's good.

23:22.192 --> 23:25.237
Throw some hot glue
in there 'cause it'll define that line.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.991
-Love it.
-Yeah. That'll be nice.

23:30.075 --> 23:33.120
We'll soon have the softest
unicorn this side of the rainbow.

23:33.203 --> 23:36.873
Ugh, I wanna sleep on this.
Can I just lay on it for a minute?

23:36.957 --> 23:38.125
But on the other side…

23:40.919 --> 23:43.839
is the crappiest-looking
wooden pot of gold I've ever seen.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.054
Voila.

23:58.895 --> 24:00.939
-There we go.
-The butt should be right--

24:01.022 --> 24:03.942
<i>Attention, Jimmy.</i>
<i>Children calling.</i>

24:04.025 --> 24:05.235
<i>-Attention, Jimmy!</i>

24:05.318 --> 24:06.736
<i>Time to talk to the kids again!</i>

24:07.863 --> 24:09.156
<i>Hello!</i>

24:09.239 --> 24:10.824
Oh, hey, Jemmie. How are you?

24:10.907 --> 24:11.908
<i>I'm good.</i>

24:11.992 --> 24:14.536
We're busy.
What do you wanna talk to us about?

24:14.619 --> 24:16.079
<i>How is my unicorn going?</i>

24:16.163 --> 24:19.291
-What do you wanna know about it?
-<i>What it looks like.</i>

24:19.374 --> 24:22.252
Well, the head is green
and made out of foam rubber.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.755
Are you impressed with this?

24:26.256 --> 24:28.383
<i>-No.</i>
-Yeah. I don't like it either.

24:28.884 --> 24:30.177
So, Jemmie, I'm busy working.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.846
Could you get to the point?
What is it you want to bother me about?

24:32.929 --> 24:34.973
<i>I want the unicorn to fart!</i>

24:35.974 --> 24:37.267
<i>Oh no.</i>

24:37.350 --> 24:39.478
<i>Not again. That sucks.</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:43.899
<i>Fart glitter.</i>

24:44.983 --> 24:47.194
You want the unicorn to fart glitter?

24:48.153 --> 24:49.404
<i>Yes.</i>

24:49.488 --> 24:50.822
<i>And colors.</i>

24:50.906 --> 24:52.908
-Glitter and colors.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

24:55.035 --> 24:56.328
Just think.

24:56.411 --> 24:57.996
Jemmie, we're halfway through this build,

24:58.079 --> 25:00.457
and I didn't really make plans
for a glitter-farting device.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.251
<i>Please!</i>

25:03.335 --> 25:05.629
<i>Or I'm gonna fart at your face!</i>

25:05.712 --> 25:08.173
-How can you say no to that?

25:08.256 --> 25:10.008
-Come on!

25:10.509 --> 25:12.928
All right, Jemmie.
You warmed my cold heart.

25:13.011 --> 25:14.471
We're gonna give you what you want.

25:14.554 --> 25:17.140
Not because we're nice,
it's the premise of the show.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.809
<i>Thank you!</i>

25:19.893 --> 25:22.145
-You're gonna get your glitter fart.
-<i>Yay!</i>

25:22.771 --> 25:24.648
<i>I can't wait to see it!</i>

25:24.731 --> 25:25.649
Neither can we.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.610
Get off my screen!
I gotta go back to work.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.028
Bye-bye!

25:30.111 --> 25:32.822
This is what happens
when a seven-year-old is your boss.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.326
All right. You guys heard the brat.
We gotta make this thing fart!

25:37.369 --> 25:39.955
So it comes out of here?

25:41.957 --> 25:42.999
From there.

25:44.084 --> 25:45.460
All right.

25:46.044 --> 25:47.379
You heard the little brat.

25:47.462 --> 25:51.091
She wants a glitter-fart to happen
out of the back of the unicorn.

25:51.174 --> 25:53.843
Let me… Let me think about this.

25:53.927 --> 25:57.264
This is the part where we put our hands
in our pockets and go, "Mm-hmm."

25:57.347 --> 26:00.225
Yeah. Just stare at him.
We've been doing it all along anyways.

26:00.308 --> 26:03.103
-Let me practice. Hold on.

26:03.186 --> 26:05.605
-How's this?
- Me, me, me! Wait, hold on. Mm-hmm?

26:05.689 --> 26:08.024
We gotta make it shoot glitter.

26:08.108 --> 26:10.235
-Mm-hmm.
-So, compressed air.

26:10.318 --> 26:11.528
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

26:11.611 --> 26:14.406
With a ball valve.
We fill it up like a tire.

26:14.489 --> 26:16.074
-Mm-hmm.
-And then you let the air out…

26:16.157 --> 26:17.742
Pssht! in one shot.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.161
-What do you think?
-Mm-hmm

26:20.245 --> 26:22.080
-Mm-hmm
-All right.

26:22.163 --> 26:23.915
We have a compression tank,

26:23.999 --> 26:26.543
and it goes up to something that shoots.

26:26.626 --> 26:29.588
Okay. I'm gonna be riding it.
How do we trigger it?

26:29.671 --> 26:33.425
We put a valve right there.
There'll be a trigger that you'll release.

26:33.508 --> 26:36.344
Kind of like a more safe version
of like a potato gun.

26:36.428 --> 26:38.972
-Like a potato gun but with air.
-Gotcha.

26:39.055 --> 26:41.600
-Like how you fill a tire with a valve?
-Yeah.

26:41.683 --> 26:45.061
We're gonna fill that tank up.
Just like we'd fill a bicycle tire.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.856
Put the confetti in here.
It's gonna go up underneath the tail.

26:47.939 --> 26:50.775
And then when you're riding,
you're gonna reach with all your dexterity

26:50.859 --> 26:53.111
and things are going like this,
you're gonna go…

26:53.194 --> 26:54.779
Right in Jackman's face.

26:54.863 --> 26:59.159
Since this is a last-minute
add-in, and since I'm such a nice guy,

26:59.242 --> 27:01.036
I'll make two cannons,

27:01.119 --> 27:02.704
one for each team.

27:12.672 --> 27:16.009
So, unicorn needs a horn.
So that's what this box is for.

27:16.092 --> 27:19.137
Built this box to be a mold
for an epoxy resin casting.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.807
And according to my math, we're gonna pour
about 4/10 of an inch layers,

27:22.891 --> 27:25.727
twelve different colors,
so each layer will be a different color.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.687
By the time those 12 layers are done,

27:28.271 --> 27:30.774
that'll be a five-inch thick mold
at the top of this box here.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.276
-Too many numbers?
-Yeah.

27:33.360 --> 27:35.028
-You don't have to worry about that.
-Okay.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.030
'Cause once we're done,
you'll put it on the lathe

27:37.113 --> 27:41.076
and then shape this baby into the most
beautiful unicorn horn we've ever seen.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.036
Can't wait.

27:49.751 --> 27:52.045
We have 12 different colors
to lay into the box,

27:52.128 --> 27:53.713
and we don't want them mixing.

27:53.797 --> 27:54.714
Looks delicious.

27:54.798 --> 27:57.133
You can't… You can't.
No, no, no. Don't eat it.

27:57.217 --> 28:00.720
So each layer has to be dry
before the next one is poured.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.806
Which means we mix.

28:03.640 --> 28:04.641
We pour.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.601
We wait.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.605
-We mix.
<i>Let's mix.</i>

28:10.689 --> 28:12.649
-We pour.
<i>Let's pour.</i>

28:12.732 --> 28:13.566
We wait.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.151
We have about 15 minutes.

28:15.235 --> 28:17.070
<i> Mix.</i>

28:17.153 --> 28:18.947
<i> Pour.</i>

28:19.030 --> 28:22.742
-Wait.
<i>-Let's mix. Let's pour. Let's wait.</i>

28:22.826 --> 28:24.786
Mix, pour, all done.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.621
That's what happens when you have a plan.

28:28.081 --> 28:29.124
Friends.

28:34.295 --> 28:36.798
Okay. Just like Jimmy,
this has hardened over time.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.799
Get it?

28:38.383 --> 28:39.801
Let's see how it turned out.

28:45.056 --> 28:47.392
Ahh! Look at that!

28:47.475 --> 28:49.144
Well, you don't know it yet,

28:49.644 --> 28:53.690
but this is the coolest
unicorn horn you'll ever see.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.150
Wow.

28:55.233 --> 28:57.610
We'll cut it, shape it, turn it.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.362
It'll be a rainbow unicorn horn.

28:59.446 --> 29:01.990
-Whoo-hoo. I'm excited.
-It does look edible.

29:03.032 --> 29:05.285
-Yeah.
-Don't eat it.

29:05.368 --> 29:06.995
-Don't eat it.
-Oh no.

29:07.078 --> 29:10.331
See how quick he walked away?
That means he's gonna eat it.

29:10.915 --> 29:13.960
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>straight from Montreal, Canada,</i>

29:14.043 --> 29:16.212
<i>it's the disc jockey of lathes,</i>

29:16.296 --> 29:18.298
<i>the master of turning.</i>

29:18.381 --> 29:22.135
<i>The one, the only Canadian Pat!</i>

29:22.218 --> 29:23.178
<i>Hit it, Pat.</i>

29:36.149 --> 29:39.194
-<i>Cut it, shape it, turn it.</i>
-<i>I'm excited.</i>

29:39.277 --> 29:40.737
<i>It'll be a rainbow unicorn horn.</i>

29:42.447 --> 29:45.492
-<i>It looks edible. Don't eat it.</i>
-<i>Yeah. </i>

29:58.755 --> 30:00.423
<i>It'll be a rainbow unicorn horn.</i>

30:04.761 --> 30:06.805
So I'm gonna
make a horn for the unicorn.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.223
I'm gonna use the CNC.

30:08.306 --> 30:11.100
That's a fancy machine
that's hooked up to a computer.

30:11.184 --> 30:14.646
So it makes it real easy to carve wood,
and it makes it look pretty.

30:14.729 --> 30:18.691
CNC stands for
"computer numerical control,"

30:18.775 --> 30:22.529
which is boring for,
"Let the computer do the work."

30:23.029 --> 30:26.449
It's basically like a printer,
but with a cutter instead of ink.

30:26.533 --> 30:29.786
Most CNC routers
can only cut in two dimensions,

30:29.869 --> 30:33.039
but this one's
- fully capable of 3
- D carving.

30:33.122 --> 30:34.874
If I was doing this by hand,

30:34.958 --> 30:38.294
it would've taken me forever,
and I would've looked stupid, like…

30:38.378 --> 30:40.547
-Wow.
-Isn't that cool?

30:40.630 --> 30:43.800
But now, I've got
a perfectly shaped unicorn horn

30:43.883 --> 30:45.134
in a matter of minutes.

30:45.718 --> 30:47.637
So just like that, it's done.

30:47.720 --> 30:51.391
These idiots spent all day carving theirs,
it's not gonna look as nice.

30:53.309 --> 30:54.686
What we have here is some PVC pipe.

30:54.769 --> 30:57.146
We're gonna make the fart chamber here
out of the larger pipe.

30:57.230 --> 31:00.525
I have to cut several different pieces,
glue them together.

31:00.608 --> 31:03.820
We're gonna zigzag this around
and make this the air pressure chamber,

31:03.903 --> 31:05.947
and between the two,
there'll be a ball valve.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.118
We'll create pressure inside this chamber.
When we're ready to shoot the confetti,

31:10.201 --> 31:13.329
we'll switch the ball valve,
and it'll fart confetti out of this tube,

31:13.413 --> 31:16.165
which will be properly placed
inside of the unicorn.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.710
Farting confetti. Real funny.

31:19.586 --> 31:22.213
I need to connect
all these pieces of PVC together,

31:22.297 --> 31:24.924
but I can't drill holes in them
because I need them to be airtight

31:25.008 --> 31:26.718
in order to build up pressure.

31:26.801 --> 31:29.178
I can't screw it, but I sure can glue it.

31:29.262 --> 31:33.725
So I'm using this PVC glue to get all the
pieces adhered together nice and tightly.

31:37.937 --> 31:40.273
Here it is.
We're looking at a fart glitter cannon.

31:40.356 --> 31:43.943
This is the barrel of the gun.
This is the trigger of the gun.

31:44.027 --> 31:45.153
This is the chamber.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.822
This gauge tells you
how much air pressure is in it.

31:47.906 --> 31:50.617
You fill the air pressure right here,
just like a tire,

31:50.700 --> 31:53.870
and when you're ready,
you load the cannon and you go kablooey.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.997
-And you let it shoot out.
-Nice.

31:56.080 --> 31:59.042
It's not armed. Don't worry.
Get me the air over there.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.294
-Oh jeez.
-Oh gosh.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.630
Oh my God. Who did this?

32:03.713 --> 32:05.506
-Graz, what are you doing?
-Hold on.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.550
With a team like this,
how could I go wrong?

32:07.634 --> 32:09.427
-Here we go.

32:09.510 --> 32:11.095
-That was easy.
-That was easy enough.

32:11.179 --> 32:12.639
-Yeah. Jesus!
-Good work. Ow!

32:12.722 --> 32:15.558
We don't want the air pressure
to go over 80 at any given time.

32:15.642 --> 32:16.684
I got an idea.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.061
-What?
-See if it…

32:18.144 --> 32:19.812
-Shoots that way?
-Yeah.

32:20.980 --> 32:24.525
I've seen back in the Revolutionary War,
they did this with the muskets.

32:24.609 --> 32:26.569
Ready? Hey, guys. Eat my dust!

32:31.658 --> 32:32.784
He's eating it.

32:35.161 --> 32:36.037
All right.

32:37.080 --> 32:37.914
Love it.

32:38.414 --> 32:41.125
-Nice work, Jimmy. Good job.
-That's pretty awesome.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.965
I think if we tie a rope to the end,
you'll tug on that rope.

32:47.048 --> 32:49.133
We'll wire it so that it's easy to grab.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.510
And victory will be ours.

32:50.593 --> 32:53.846
Victory will be ours. Come on.
Let's put the finishing touches on,

32:53.930 --> 32:56.808
and the dumbest thing we've made
will be out of our lives.

32:56.891 --> 32:57.976
And I can move on.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.229
It's finally time
to make our unicorn truly magical.

33:01.312 --> 33:02.897
It's gonna have magical earlobes.

33:02.981 --> 33:06.192
First, we'll attach
its magical head to its magical body.

33:07.068 --> 33:09.487
-Hello, Graz.
-That's not nightmare fuel.

33:09.570 --> 33:13.116
It's important for our unicorn
to be able to hear Jackman and Pat lose,

33:13.199 --> 33:15.284
so we made some cute little magical ears.

33:15.368 --> 33:17.203
-Looks like a lamb.
-It kinda does.

33:19.080 --> 33:22.667
Using a three-inch hole saw,
we'll create an opening in the backside.

33:22.750 --> 33:24.794
Jimmy was nice enough
to make us a fart cannon.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.838
We'll put that in the butthole.

33:27.714 --> 33:31.592
With our legs in place, we're gonna add
some texture to our wooden masterpiece

33:31.676 --> 33:33.219
by covering it with wooden shingles.

33:33.302 --> 33:34.429
It smells so good.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.141
We're attaching the head
to a pivot on the neck,

33:38.224 --> 33:40.143
so our unicorn can nod
while we're winning.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.437
-Boom!
-Because Jemmie wanted all the colors…

33:42.520 --> 33:43.855
Patrick!

33:43.938 --> 33:46.024
…we picked out a beautiful rainbow mane.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.400
Ahhh!

33:47.483 --> 33:50.528
And because all little girls
enjoy a nice burnt-wood finish

33:51.988 --> 33:55.241
we're going to use a blowtorch
to create the eyes and the hooves.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.411
And voilà!

33:59.537 --> 34:02.165
Now we gotta
give our unicorn some personality.

34:02.707 --> 34:03.708
Some pretty hair,

34:05.918 --> 34:07.545
a pair of golden wings,

34:08.546 --> 34:10.757
an eye to watch over Graz.

34:11.507 --> 34:13.134
And last, but not least…

34:13.217 --> 34:14.886
And last but not least…

34:14.969 --> 34:16.179
Look away, kids.

34:18.264 --> 34:21.476
The best unicorn horn you've ever seen.

34:25.938 --> 34:29.108
Take a look at these things.
Things of beauty, huh?

34:29.192 --> 34:31.486
-Pretty impressive.
-Museum pieces.

34:31.569 --> 34:34.030
Jemmie's gonna love it.
I hope she appreciates this.

34:34.113 --> 34:35.907
We will see you on the track tomorrow.

34:35.990 --> 34:37.325
May the best unicorn win.

34:37.909 --> 34:38.868
Friends.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.714
-Hey. Look who it is.
-It's the nature boys.

34:51.798 --> 34:52.965
-Yeah.
-What's up?

34:53.049 --> 34:53.966
Look at this.

34:54.050 --> 34:57.428
-Oh. That's adorable.
-That's fine. My allergies aren't bad.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.222
-Thanks.
-What are we doing?

34:59.305 --> 35:02.266
Today's the big day. It's time
to show Jemmie a double dose of dumb.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.311
You two, inside.
You two, on the gates. Let's go.

35:05.394 --> 35:07.480
Let's bring Jemmie up. Jemmie!

35:08.231 --> 35:09.690
<i>Hi, Jimmy!</i>

35:09.774 --> 35:12.318
I think we built something
that you're really gonna like.

35:12.401 --> 35:15.071
<i>Oh my God. I'm ready to hear this.</i>

35:15.154 --> 35:17.573
Having a unicorn wasn't enough.
You asked for…

35:17.657 --> 35:20.743
<i>A unicorn bicycle!</i>

35:20.827 --> 35:23.204
You didn't just ask for one.
You asked for…

35:23.287 --> 35:24.789
<i>Two!</i>

35:24.872 --> 35:27.667
-Like the greedy little princess you are.
<i>-Yes.</i>

35:27.750 --> 35:29.544
Have you seen a horse made of wood?

35:29.627 --> 35:31.629
<i>-No.</i>
-Neither have I because it's stupid.

35:31.712 --> 35:33.172
-Hey.
-Your horse sucks.

35:33.256 --> 35:35.174
Jemmie, there was one thing you added.

35:35.258 --> 35:38.010
<i>A unicorn farting glitter!</i>

35:38.094 --> 35:40.763
Why… Why the obsession with glitter farts?

35:40.847 --> 35:42.849
<i>Because it's funny.</i>

35:42.932 --> 35:46.018
<i>I want everyone in </i>my<i> show to laugh.</i>

35:46.102 --> 35:47.103
Your show?

35:47.186 --> 35:49.730
<i>You work for me, you clown!</i>

35:52.775 --> 35:54.193
And then last but not least,

35:54.277 --> 35:56.779
you asked for these two ridiculous things
to race one another.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.240
<i>Race it! Race it!</i>

35:59.323 --> 36:01.242
<i>Who's gonna win?</i>

36:01.325 --> 36:02.785
<i>Can I see it now?</i>

36:02.869 --> 36:03.995
Fine. Are you ready?

36:04.078 --> 36:05.580
<i> Yes!</i>

36:05.663 --> 36:08.291
Are you ready to see
your <i>two</i> unicornacycles?

36:08.374 --> 36:09.542
<i>Let me see. Let me see.</i>

36:09.625 --> 36:12.378
Hours and hours of work
making two of the stupidest horses,

36:12.461 --> 36:13.796
and this is all you give me?

36:13.880 --> 36:17.550
<i>I can't wait! I can't wait!</i>

36:17.633 --> 36:18.968
Hit it.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.857
<i>Look at these unicorns.</i>

36:32.940 --> 36:34.150
<i>Oh my God!</i>

36:35.860 --> 36:36.777
<i>Yeah!</i>

36:38.362 --> 36:39.405
<i>Oh my God. Oh my God.</i>

36:40.156 --> 36:43.117
Jemmie, I'm gonna show you
the unicorn me and my team built.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.411
<i>Okay! </i>

36:46.579 --> 36:49.957
We named it Wingin' It because
that's what we always do. We wing it.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.834
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

36:51.918 --> 36:54.086
Our unicorn is covered
with fluffy white fur,

36:54.170 --> 36:56.380
just like a real unicorn's supposed to be.

36:56.464 --> 36:58.591
<i>-I want to touch it.</i>
-I think we're gonna lose.

36:58.674 --> 37:00.676
And because you asked for wings,

37:00.760 --> 37:03.012
we have beautiful gold wings.

37:03.095 --> 37:05.556
-And a special treat.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.227
When this thing moves,
the legs flutter like he's flying.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.479
And, Jemmie, just as you asked for,

37:11.562 --> 37:14.982
we have a big, pink fart-cannon
attached to the back.

37:16.359 --> 37:17.526
<i>It's cool!</i>

37:17.610 --> 37:20.321
Now that I've showed you the best,
I'm gonna let you see the rest.

37:20.404 --> 37:21.239
<i>Okay.</i>

37:22.448 --> 37:25.701
This here wooden masterpiece
is named Passing Wind.

37:27.912 --> 37:29.580
We built a tandem bike.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.958
It's a bike that two people
can ride at the same time.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.084
<i>Oh my gosh!</i>

37:33.167 --> 37:34.627
The body's made from wood.

37:34.710 --> 37:36.629
It's recycled, reclaimed,
saved from the trash.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.256
<i>Okay.</i>

37:39.548 --> 37:40.591
Perfect reaction.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.593
I made the unicorn horn.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.388
It's made of plastic.
So there's a lot of colors in them.

37:45.471 --> 37:46.305
<i>Yeah!</i>

37:46.389 --> 37:48.557
-The glitter fart-cannon you asked for?
-<i>Yes.</i>

37:48.641 --> 37:51.227
We have one too, but it's twice as big.

37:54.855 --> 37:56.315
All right! All right!

37:56.399 --> 37:57.400
-The race.
-<i>Yes!</i>

37:57.483 --> 38:00.111
Let's get these monstrosities
to the starting gate!

38:00.695 --> 38:01.821
-Let's race!

38:06.701 --> 38:10.329
Welcome to
the Inaugural Unicornacycle Derby!

38:13.791 --> 38:15.501
Do you know
what a winner looks like?

38:15.584 --> 38:16.961
We're gonna win, right?

38:18.879 --> 38:20.298
Awesome mental attitude.

38:20.381 --> 38:22.800
<i>I'm excited for this.</i>

38:22.883 --> 38:24.385
-That makes one of us.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.263
All right, gentlemen, to your gates!

38:28.264 --> 38:29.890
<i>Welcome,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

38:29.974 --> 38:33.311
<i>It's a beautiful day at Rainbow Land</i>
<i>and boy, do we have a race for you.</i>

38:35.479 --> 38:38.858
<i>Competing in today's high stakes</i>
<i>single for long race is Wingin' It.</i>

38:39.567 --> 38:43.195
<i>Under the close eye of trainer Derek from</i>
<i>Malden and owner Jimmy DiResta,</i>

38:43.279 --> 38:46.782
<i>and driven by seven-time</i>
<i>National Jockey winner Graz.</i>

38:46.866 --> 38:47.908
Any last words, Graz?

38:47.992 --> 38:50.536
It was cool
to work in TV for a little bit.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.873
<i>And competing alongside them</i>
<i>is Passing Wind,</i>

38:53.956 --> 38:54.915
<i>a four-year-old mare.</i>

38:54.999 --> 38:58.753
<i>And special double jockey join,</i>
<i>Pat Lap and Paul Jackman.</i>

38:58.836 --> 39:00.588
-Friends?
-Yeah. Friends.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.173
All right, Jemmie. Are you ready?

39:02.757 --> 39:03.674
<i>Yes!</i>

39:04.175 --> 39:05.301
On your marks.

39:06.135 --> 39:07.219
<i>Get set.</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:09.347
Go!

39:09.930 --> 39:11.098
<i>And they're off!</i>

39:12.933 --> 39:14.935
<i>Passing Wind takes an early lead</i>

39:15.019 --> 39:17.355
<i>with Wingin' It</i>
<i>trailing two lengths behind.</i>

39:17.938 --> 39:19.273
<i>And they're into the stretch.</i>

39:21.317 --> 39:24.653
<i>Passing Wind living up to its name</i>
<i>and deploying gas early and often.</i>

39:24.737 --> 39:26.405
-Oh!

39:29.325 --> 39:30.534
I need more power!

39:30.618 --> 39:32.036
<i>Horsepower.</i>

39:33.537 --> 39:37.708
<i>Oh, releasing a tardy fart,</i>
<i>Wingin' It is really struggling.</i>

39:37.792 --> 39:39.835
-Come on! Go, Graz!
-Graz!

39:39.919 --> 39:41.962
-Yeah!
-Go! Go! Go!

39:42.046 --> 39:44.507
<i>And Passing Wind</i>
<i>is finishing with a bang!</i>

39:46.050 --> 39:49.136
<i>Sealing their triple crown</i>
<i>victory at the unicornacycle derby.</i>

39:49.220 --> 39:51.472
-Graz!
-What happened, Graz?

39:51.555 --> 39:53.140
-Did I win?
-No.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.017
I wanna test them for PEDs.

39:55.101 --> 39:56.936
Yeah!

39:57.019 --> 39:59.605
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

39:59.688 --> 40:01.816
That's what happens
when friends work together.

40:01.899 --> 40:03.442
Yeah. The fart in my face,

40:03.526 --> 40:05.694
it was a little unexpected,
as they usually are.

40:06.445 --> 40:09.281
It's gonna be a tough pill to swallow.
But you know what?

40:09.365 --> 40:12.451
You gotta dust yourself off of sparkles
and get back on the unicorn.

40:12.535 --> 40:15.496
Graz, to say I was disappointed
would be an understatement.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.289
Jemmie, let me ask you an honest question.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.208
We know that this unicorn won,

40:19.291 --> 40:21.710
but which unicorn
was the one you liked the most?

40:21.794 --> 40:23.587
<i>I liked-ed the white one.</i>

40:23.671 --> 40:25.923
So everybody goes home a winner!

40:26.006 --> 40:27.842
-We're all winners.
-Just like Jackman likes.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.051
<i>We're all winners!</i>

40:29.135 --> 40:32.138
Jemmie, did we satisfy
your twisted little dreams?

40:32.221 --> 40:34.265
<i>Yes! You did!</i>

40:34.348 --> 40:37.852
<i>Thank you, thank you,</i>
<i>thank you so, so, so much!</i>

40:37.935 --> 40:39.562
<i>You have fun?</i>

40:39.645 --> 40:40.813
I did have fun.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.898
He did. He smiled once. I seen it.

40:42.982 --> 40:45.401
All right, guys. I think we did our job.

40:45.985 --> 40:47.695
<i>Thank you, everybody!</i>

40:48.195 --> 40:50.448
What are you still doing here?
Get off my screen.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.617
I don't know what we just did,
but it's over.

40:53.701 --> 40:55.035
And that's my favorite part.

40:56.537 --> 40:57.705
Clean this crap up.

41:01.709 --> 41:05.045
We have to get away fast,
or Jimmy will make us clean up!

41:06.505 --> 41:10.342
Do you think we're far enough away?
We need to get out of here!

41:11.844 --> 41:12.761
Ahh!

41:13.679 --> 41:15.181
No!
