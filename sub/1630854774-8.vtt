00:28.779 --> 00:29.780
Hi, Grandpa.

00:29.780 --> 00:31.532
Mase-man. How you doing?

00:31.532 --> 00:36.328
I thought I was gonna get
your mom's voice mail again. How are ya?

00:36.328 --> 00:38.539
- <i>I'm good.</i>
- How's baseball going?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.290
Awesome. I'm playing center field.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.836
Wow. Very important position.

00:43.836 --> 00:47.422
Much better than right field.
That's where they put all the nerds.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.258
You're not supposed to say "nerds."

00:49.258 --> 00:51.385
Not supposed to say "nerds?"

00:51.969 --> 00:53.178
<i>That's stupid.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.639
Kiddo, is your mom around?
Could you put your mom on?

00:55.639 --> 00:57.266
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Paul.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.976
Paul, hey. Hey, it's Dave.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.728
Look. Meg is in the shower,

01:01.728 --> 01:04.272
but you know she doesn't
wanna talk right now.

01:04.272 --> 01:07.901
Yeah, well, do me a favor, Dave. Will you
just tell her that that's childish?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.611
Good talking to you, Paul.

01:09.611 --> 01:11.738
Well, it's good talking to you too, Dave.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.823
<i>Bye.</i>

01:19.872 --> 01:22.040
For a week or so, Donny was great.

01:23.083 --> 01:27.087
But now he's back to criticizing
every single thing I do.

01:28.672 --> 01:29.673
Well, Grace,

01:29.673 --> 01:31.175
you know my professional opinion.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.636
Your husband's a fucking tool.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.682
I'm sorry, but he has the energy of
an '80s movie villain, you know?

01:38.682 --> 01:41.435
Like, he would definitely sweep the leg
if he was commanded to by his sensei.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.188
Well, it never stops. And I do everything.

01:44.188 --> 01:45.939
Like, all he does is make coffee.

01:45.939 --> 01:51.111
Like, "Eggs are too runny, Grace,
but this coffee's next level.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.865
You fucked up the laundry again
but my coffee is tight as shit."

01:55.741 --> 01:58.368
I'm sorry, he says "tight as shit"
about a beverage?

01:58.368 --> 02:02.706
You know, sometimes I just wanna push
his precious coffee right off the table.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.959
Just like, boop. All over his weird balls.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.960
Weird how?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.588
They're enormous, and they're just not--

02:09.588 --> 02:13.592
Okay, I don't need to know.
You should do it, Grace.

02:14.259 --> 02:17.137
I mean, not onto his testicles,
'cause that would be assault, but yeah,

02:17.137 --> 02:20.474
like, into a kitchen sink or something.
That's called a pattern interrupt.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.142
So, boop him?

02:23.227 --> 02:26.813
Boop. Nobody changes bad behavior
without consequences.

02:27.356 --> 02:30.651
You fuck up, Grace,
you gotta face the music.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.904
As a matter of fact,
I'm gonna be facing it later today.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.156
Why? What'd you do?

02:37.991 --> 02:40.327
I'm sorry that I had sex with Auntie Gaby.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.037
Oh, my God.

02:42.037 --> 02:45.582
Dude, she's literally never called me
"Auntie Gaby" in her fucking life.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.669
Why would you say that?
Are you trying to make it weirder for her?

02:48.669 --> 02:50.170
I'm not trying, it's just happening.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.255
Okay, I'm gonna go.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.298
Wait. Please, please, please. Just--

02:53.298 --> 02:55.384
We feel like the only way
to get to the other side of this

02:55.384 --> 02:56.844
- is with an honest conversation.
- Right.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.471
I don't wanna hear
about how you desecrated Gaby.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.682
Hold up.
We actually desecrated each other.

03:01.682 --> 03:03.684
That's right.
She did a lot of the heavy lifting.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.020
And you know me. You really think
I didn't have a fucking say in this?

03:07.604 --> 03:11.358
You think it's just all based on
his charisma and his game?

03:11.358 --> 03:14.695
Look at your dad's face. That's the face
of somebody who's only slept with what?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.947
Two to three women tops.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.782
- It's just face.
- Okay.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.951
Oh, my God. Fine, you win, Gaby. Okay?

03:20.951 --> 03:23.370
I'm fucking mad at you too.
Do you want me to call you Mommy?

03:23.370 --> 03:25.706
Hey, I don't like that.
I don't like that one bit.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.793
Your father and I, we had a discussion,
and we decided that it was a huge mistake.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.547
Absolutely right. We were both just in a
vulnerable spot, and--

03:33.547 --> 03:34.631
- No.
- Okay.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.050
- And it meant nothing.
- Nothing.

03:37.050 --> 03:41.013
So, to get this straight, you bang someone
who doesn't mean anything to you,

03:41.013 --> 03:43.348
but meant a lot to Mom,
and you did it in Mom's bed?

03:44.600 --> 03:48.020
It's my bed too, okay?
Did it come from her childhood home? Yes.

03:48.604 --> 03:50.898
Was that a gift from Grandpa
after Grandma died? Sure.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.233
But it wasn't just her bed,
it was mine also.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.360
Also, it didn't all happen in the bed.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.529
Stop, stop, stop.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.573
- There was some standing.
- Oh, Jesus.

03:59.573 --> 04:00.657
I'm gonna go puke.

04:01.158 --> 04:03.619
Yeah. Fair. That was fair.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.206
What the fuck is wrong with you?

04:07.206 --> 04:09.583
We said we were gonna be honest,
and there was some standing.

04:11.168 --> 04:12.377
See you at work.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.078
How do you eat this shit?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.496
You've never had Fun Dip?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.039
No, I've never had Fun Dip.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.959
You just scoop up the sugar stuff
with the stick

04:51.959 --> 04:53.544
and afterwards you can eat the stick.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.421
- No shit?
- Yeah.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.215
Why do I have to pay you in candy?

04:58.799 --> 05:01.426
'Cause you're poor and I like candy.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.935
Summer keeps texting me
about her fucking Garden Party tonight.

05:10.435 --> 05:11.436
What's a Garden Party?

05:11.436 --> 05:14.022
It's like Drinks Under the Bridge,

05:14.022 --> 05:17.442
except everybody sneaks into
Kinneola Gardens and gets fucked up there.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.611
Summer's good at naming things.

05:20.696 --> 05:24.867
Maybe I should go. Everyone
in my life just does whatever they want.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.203
You know, last week, I was at the beach
and this USC guy came up to me

05:28.203 --> 05:32.291
and was asking me where I went to college,
and totally hitting on me.

05:33.208 --> 05:35.836
Maybe I should've just gone home with him
on his Vespa.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.964
Don't even joke about hooking up
with guys who ride Vespas.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.300
You can eat this?

05:46.221 --> 05:47.222
That's good stick.

05:47.222 --> 05:51.059
You are the only normal adult
in my life right now.

05:51.685 --> 05:55.105
Yeah.
My dad is being such a stupid asshole.

05:55.105 --> 05:57.024
Why don't you just cut him some slack?

05:57.941 --> 06:01.069
You young people think you're
the only ones in the world with problems.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.280
Your dad's going through some shit.

06:04.740 --> 06:05.741
Everyone is.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.286
It's not just all about you, you know?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.456
- I never said it was.
- What--

06:12.456 --> 06:16.251
But you said these talks were for venting
about what's bothering me, so--

06:16.251 --> 06:19.087
Oh, my God. I don't know
what's up your butt but fuck this.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.756
Okay. Look, I'm sorry.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.341
I was--

06:22.341 --> 06:24.176
I'm stuck in my own stuff.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.512
I shouldn't have put it on you.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.391
Please don't go. Come on. If you go,
I'm gonna feel like shit.

06:32.184 --> 06:33.185
Bye.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.314
You've got a way with women,
don't you, Paul?

06:45.364 --> 06:46.448
Shit.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.910
That is a very bad hiking outfit.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.995
You think? I already have swamp ass.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.331
I was hoping we could talk
before you started hiking.

06:54.331 --> 06:57.417
Yeah, sorry man. I can't be flexible
with my wedding workout schedule.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.753
I'm just a few weeks away
from being shirtless all the time.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.255
Even at work and restaurants.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.840
I don't even fuck shirtless anymore.

07:04.216 --> 07:08.095
Hey, listen, Charlie. I already spoke
to Brian about my behavior at the party,

07:08.095 --> 07:09.847
but I wanted to apologize to you also.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.307
- It's all good. We love you, Jimmy.
- Yeah.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.726
By the way, we're moving the wedding up.

07:15.269 --> 07:18.355
Next month is the perfect time
for us to both take off from work.

07:18.355 --> 07:19.690
Also, if we throw it together fast

07:19.690 --> 07:22.359
we can accidentally forget to
invite anyone we secretly hate.

07:22.860 --> 07:24.152
Ben.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.530
And hey, man. Stop for a second, okay?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.324
I know that
we promised to officiate for each other...

07:29.324 --> 07:30.242
Yeah.

07:30.242 --> 07:34.121
...but I'm sure the last thing you wanna do
is make a big speech

07:34.121 --> 07:35.372
about love and marriage.

07:35.372 --> 07:37.499
No, what? Are you kidding?
I'm super excited about this.

07:37.499 --> 07:40.460
I'm gonna knock it out of the park
just like you did for Tia and me.

07:40.961 --> 07:45.132
Hey, I'm gonna head back. Because
my thighs are bleeding through my pants,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.134
- so I'll see you guys later.
- Okay.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.969
- Bye.
- Bye. Bye, buddy.

07:51.847 --> 07:53.891
Great job telling him
you didn't want him to marry us.

07:53.891 --> 07:54.975
Be quiet.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.186
- Bye!
- Bye!

07:58.729 --> 08:01.148
- Fuck.
- It's okay.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.775
I have a question for you.
How do you feel about art shows?

08:03.775 --> 08:04.860
Kill me dead.

08:04.860 --> 08:07.654
Okay. Well, do you wanna come with me
to an art show?

08:07.654 --> 08:10.073
Yes, I'll drive. Too thirsty?

08:10.073 --> 08:12.451
Yes, but it works for us.
That's part of our brand.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.203
We have a brand?

08:14.203 --> 08:15.579
I'm so excited we have a brand.

08:15.579 --> 08:16.914
But listen, here's the deal,

08:16.914 --> 08:21.251
Nico invited me to his art show
and I really wanna support.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.336
How's his stuff?

08:22.336 --> 08:24.588
Do his painting
actually look like something,

08:24.588 --> 08:27.132
or are they just kind of, like, blah?

08:27.966 --> 08:31.678
Some are "blah,"
but then some are like, "Okay."

08:31.678 --> 08:32.804
Hey, y'all.

08:32.804 --> 08:33.722
Hi.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.432
Liz, I got your platter from the barbecue.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.390
Thank you.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.645
Hey, Sean.
Would you wanna go to an art show with us?

08:39.645 --> 08:40.562
Like paintings?

08:41.605 --> 08:43.357
Some are "blah," but some are "okay."

08:44.066 --> 08:45.275
I think you'll dig it.

08:45.275 --> 08:47.819
Plus, you know I can't bring
a rich white lady to an art show

08:47.819 --> 08:49.404
without bringing a Black person
to balance it.

08:49.404 --> 08:51.615
- Say less. I got you.
- Thanks, fam.

08:52.282 --> 08:55.410
My other Black friends
bring me places without balancing it out.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.288
Liz, you ain't got no other Black friends.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.873
- Not a chance in hell.
- I know.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.292
But I want to so bad.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.669
Yeah.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.632
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:09.174 --> 09:11.718
I'm just cleaning some residual puke
out of the piano.

09:13.136 --> 09:16.515
As you can see,
the high C, still not working.

09:16.515 --> 09:18.183
Ah, well. You know, worst case scenario

09:18.183 --> 09:19.893
you just have to throw
the whole thing away.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.817
- I need to tell you something.
- What's up?

09:28.986 --> 09:30.571
I thought I was gonna get away
with leaving you a note.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.197
I didn't see your car.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.575
Wait, sorry. Where's my car?

09:35.075 --> 09:36.410
I don't know.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.536
What the hell?

09:37.536 --> 09:38.662
Maybe Alice took it?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.038
She doesn't have a license.

09:41.540 --> 09:42.541
Alice!

09:45.252 --> 09:47.004
Are you home? Alice!

09:50.382 --> 09:51.383
This is not good.

09:51.383 --> 09:55.345
Don't worry. This just happened
with our dog. Did you have her chipped?

10:02.352 --> 10:03.520
Yeah.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.063
This is pretty cool.

10:05.063 --> 10:08.734
Right? Plus, you needed a break
from all those rich white people.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.570
Do you think they validate?

10:11.570 --> 10:13.989
- It was fun while it lasted.
- Yeah.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.073
Oh, shit.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.158
- What?
- Look.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.118
- Over there, those women.
- Here?

10:18.118 --> 10:21.038
Those are some of Nico's old friends.
I don't think they like me very much.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.707
Well, then they're stupid.
Who do we hate the most?

10:23.707 --> 10:25.709
You can be subtle.
My key chain has a laser pointer.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.003
I don't know. It's hard to choose.
They all suck ass.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.755
I bet she's the worst.

10:29.755 --> 10:32.674
- Hey! Stop it.
- What?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.343
- I can't stand that ho.
- Ho.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.220
Look like she talking shit
about you right now.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.221
She does, doesn't she?

10:37.221 --> 10:38.472
She's probably like,

10:39.181 --> 10:42.142
"Look at her with her fine ass,
6' tall, got a PhD.

10:42.809 --> 10:45.854
Looking very moisturized, all--
Having all cool sex all the time."

10:45.854 --> 10:48.106
So, in your head you think
she's calling you "moisturized?"

10:48.106 --> 10:50.984
I didn't say she was blind, Sean.
I said she was a bitch. Get with it, man.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.361
Okay.

10:53.237 --> 10:54.446
Guys, we shouldn't have come.

10:54.446 --> 10:55.656
No, Nico wanted you to.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.157
Actually, he didn't.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.034
When he used to have shows,

10:59.034 --> 11:00.911
he would get so stressed
that he would relapse.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.829
I guess I wanted to come
to make sure he's okay.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.914
I wanted to check on him.

11:05.123 --> 11:06.416
So, you're codependent. Got it.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.169
The fuck? You don't know my life.
You don't know me.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.506
Okay. It's getting a little real.
I'll be back in five.

11:12.506 --> 11:13.590
Oh, come on.

11:15.217 --> 11:19.179
Listen, Liz.
I feel really vulnerable right now

11:19.179 --> 11:21.723
and there's plenty other time
to call me out on my bullshit,

11:21.723 --> 11:24.768
but for now,
I just want some unconditional support,

11:24.768 --> 11:27.563
and for you to throw me
a superficial compliment or two

11:27.563 --> 11:28.981
if it looks like I'm spinning out.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.316
Copy that. I can be a jerk.

11:31.817 --> 11:33.318
That's why all of my friends are rocks.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.445
But I do really appreciate you coming, okay?

11:36.530 --> 11:38.532
Honestly,
I haven't seen Nico since the divorce.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.075
What if he gets mad that I came?

11:40.075 --> 11:42.202
What if we get into this,
like, big public fight?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.954
You're so pretty.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.874
Hey, that was great.
You're a fast learner.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.209
That girl has nice abs.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.211
She does,
but she doesn't have a head.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.172
I'd give up my head for those abs.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.351
Hey, Jimmy. What did you do?

12:06.351 --> 12:07.603
Why would you say that?

12:07.603 --> 12:09.313
Because you do a lot of dumb shit.

12:09.313 --> 12:12.524
Fair, but maybe this time,
I'm just calling to say hello.

12:12.524 --> 12:13.442
Are you?

12:13.442 --> 12:16.403
Nope. I lost my kid and my car.

12:16.403 --> 12:19.114
<i>You were with her earlier, right?
Do you have any idea where she might be?</i>

12:21.533 --> 12:22.618
Oh, fuck.

12:25.287 --> 12:28.207
You really didn't have to come, Paul.
It's just a couple of minutes away.

12:28.749 --> 12:33.337
Yeah, I did. This whole
Garden Party thing is all my fault.

12:34.046 --> 12:36.131
I'm the Jimmy in this situation.

12:36.798 --> 12:38.967
- What?
- The fuck up.

12:38.967 --> 12:39.885
Of course.

12:39.885 --> 12:41.720
"Of course?" Seriously?

12:42.346 --> 12:45.182
I was upset with my daughter
and I took it out on Alice.

12:45.182 --> 12:47.059
Cardinal sin for a therapist.

12:47.059 --> 12:50.562
Come on. You had an off day.
I've had plenty of off days.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.983
Once I told a patient to relieve stress,
she should masturbate instead of meditate.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.443
They both work.

12:59.029 --> 13:00.364
What is Kevin doing here?

13:00.906 --> 13:04.243
This is my car. If you're wondering
why I'm in the back seat,

13:04.243 --> 13:06.662
- that's probably a self-esteem thing.
- You think?

13:06.662 --> 13:10.123
He was at my place
because he had something to tell me.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.292
- What was it?
- Forget about that. Let's focus on Alice.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.502
What, is it bad?

13:13.502 --> 13:15.754
No. No.

13:15.754 --> 13:17.047
It was bad.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.924
Come on. Just tell me.

13:20.509 --> 13:24.513
Okay.
I don't want you to officiate our wedding.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.437
Why the fuck
would you tell me that right now?

13:32.437 --> 13:37.526
You told me to. Jimmy,
you fell apart at our engagement party.

13:37.526 --> 13:40.028
There's no way you're gonna
hold it together for an entire wedding.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.698
I did not fall apart, okay?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.577
Fuck! Yes, I did. Okay, fine. Fuck!

13:46.577 --> 13:49.496
Man, I'm sorry. This is not a big deal.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.290
Paul, it's not a big deal, right?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.959
I thought you two were best friends.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.011
Wow, you really hate this painting.

14:05.387 --> 14:08.599
No, that's a look of self-hatred.

14:08.599 --> 14:09.766
I actually really--

14:10.851 --> 14:12.102
I really dig this one.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.938
I'm Aliyah. I actually run the gallery.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.941
- Awesome. I'm Gaby. Nice to meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, Gaby.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.235
Why are you here
beating yourself up, Gaby?

14:20.235 --> 14:24.156
You know, just putting the needs
of some guy I'm no longer with

14:24.156 --> 14:25.657
before my own self-care.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.659
- Yes. I'm very familiar.
- You know? Yeah.

14:27.659 --> 14:31.330
If it helps, I like to
save every wounded man that I meet.

14:31.914 --> 14:33.248
Even when they don't want me to.

14:34.333 --> 14:35.375
Sometimes they steal from me.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.836
- Oh, no. Yeah, holy shit.
- Yeah.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.297
- You're a disaster.
- Thank you so much. I appreciate that.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.843
Well, I'm gonna go see
if this artist is ever gonna show.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.595
- So, it was nice meeting you.
- You too.

14:46.595 --> 14:48.096
- I'll see you around.
- Yeah, totally.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.310
- This one's blah.
- Oh, come on.

14:53.310 --> 14:55.479
- Where were you?
- I was here. I just made a new friend.

14:55.479 --> 14:56.480
Is it her?

14:57.731 --> 14:58.732
Hey. Stop.

14:59.274 --> 15:00.359
Does she wanna fuck you?

15:00.359 --> 15:01.818
God, I don't know yet.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.322
Okay, they're probably up by the gazebo.

15:06.907 --> 15:08.242
Do you think he's still mad at me?

15:09.326 --> 15:12.371
It's been over eight minutes.
He's probably forgotten all about it.

15:13.539 --> 15:16.291
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God. Is that a peacock?

15:16.291 --> 15:17.876
Goddamn things are all over the park.

15:21.338 --> 15:24.049
Wait, what does it mean
when they spread their feathers like that?

15:24.049 --> 15:26.844
I can't remember.
They either want to attack us or fuck us.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.345
Not sure which I prefer.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.472
So we're gonna need a distraction.

15:30.472 --> 15:32.391
I volunteer as tribute.

15:32.391 --> 15:34.726
Don't care if I lose an eye,
if it means you forgive me.

15:34.726 --> 15:39.773
Look, I know that I fucked up.
I just-- I was really excited about this.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.984
I'm sorry. I can't.

15:42.651 --> 15:45.153
I just--
I want that day to be perfect in--

15:48.282 --> 15:49.616
Sorry, got bored.

15:51.326 --> 15:53.412
Okay. Let's go, all right.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.457
So, how's the job search going?

16:00.169 --> 16:03.797
Almost as bad as this tiny-ass crab cake.
This tastes like shit. Try it.

16:03.797 --> 16:06.633
That is a great sales pitch, Sean.
I'm gonna pass.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.969
I could do way better.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.929
Honestly,
I would love to get into catering,

16:10.929 --> 16:13.265
but there's already, like,
a million in Pasadena.

16:13.265 --> 16:16.351
Yeah, but you have an angle.
Not only can you cook,

16:16.351 --> 16:19.646
but all my snobby friends
would kill to say,

16:19.646 --> 16:23.066
"Our caterer is a young Black veteran.
I discovered him. He's amazing."

16:23.066 --> 16:25.444
- You know a lot of snobs?
- They're my people.

16:25.444 --> 16:26.528
Hey. Guys.

16:27.571 --> 16:29.615
You know, I could call it
"White Guilt Catering."

16:30.115 --> 16:31.200
I'd invest.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.077
You guys see this painting?

16:34.077 --> 16:35.454
Blah.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.497
Yeah, well, it's me.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.416
- Okay. Yeah.
- Okay.

16:43.712 --> 16:45.172
Goddamn peacocks.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.094
Guys, come on.
I said no drugs. They're wrong.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.722
- Hey, Summer.
- Hi, Mr. Laird.

16:55.098 --> 16:56.099
Is Alice here?

16:56.099 --> 16:59.436
She bailed. Dumb move.
She's missing a rager.

16:59.436 --> 17:02.231
Is she? This guy's playing Wordle
on his phone.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.691
Hey, where'd did she go?

17:04.691 --> 17:06.568
Don't know. Sorry.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.569
She's lying.

17:07.569 --> 17:10.030
- Yes. I've met Summer before, Paul.
- Yeah.

17:10.030 --> 17:10.989
Okay.

17:18.955 --> 17:20.123
So, here's the deal.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.169
I wasn't freaking out
when I thought that Alice was with you.

17:25.963 --> 17:27.881
It actually didn't bother me
when she took my car.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.633
You know why?
'Cause she knows how to drive.

17:30.968 --> 17:32.594
I taught her
when she was getting her permit.

17:33.637 --> 17:37.057
But she never got her license
'cause her mom had that accident.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.061
Probably should've made her, you know,

17:42.563 --> 17:43.814
but I was pretty checked out.

17:44.940 --> 17:49.444
To be honest, this was all much easier
when I was numb and not paying attention.

17:52.573 --> 17:53.574
But now I am.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.912
And my kid is not here,
and I'm really worried about her.

18:03.292 --> 18:06.044
So, how about you do me a solid
and tell me where the fuck she is?

18:07.504 --> 18:08.797
She went to USC.

18:10.340 --> 18:13.969
Oh, shit. She said she met
some college kid on a Vespa.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.388
Not a Vespa guy.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.556
I know. I told her.

18:17.556 --> 18:18.765
She sent me his address.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.059
Just wanted us to know
where she was in case he killed her

18:21.059 --> 18:22.686
- and we needed to find her body.
- Okay.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.772
Okay. Now I'm really fucking stressed.

18:26.982 --> 18:28.358
I'm good, man.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.320
Yeah, go.

18:31.820 --> 18:33.530
Hey, you guys know Luke? Is Luke here?

18:34.448 --> 18:36.742
Stop trying to fuck your English teacher.

18:41.163 --> 18:42.873
You have to let her go.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.418
That's me. You guys can't tell?

18:46.919 --> 18:48.754
In our defense, her head is a triangle.

18:48.754 --> 18:50.589
This is called <i>Muse on Couch</i>.

18:50.589 --> 18:53.258
I'm a therapist.
What do therapists sit on?

18:54.134 --> 18:54.968
Couches.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.847
Also, I'm a muse. I'm musing here.
I'm musing there.

18:58.847 --> 19:01.016
- I'm musing all over the fucking place.
- Uh-huh.

19:02.226 --> 19:03.227
Hey, Gaby.

19:03.894 --> 19:05.687
Hi, Nico.

19:06.855 --> 19:10.943
Hi. It's so nice to meet you. I'm Liz.
I've heard so much about you.

19:10.943 --> 19:13.570
What? Not so much.
Just a normal amount.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.905
- Right. My bad.
- I'm Sean.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.865
- Hey.
- Heard about you when I read your sign.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.367
Nice to meet you both.

19:18.367 --> 19:21.954
Come on. I know when to walk away
way more than you do.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.372
I know. It's not my strong suit.

19:25.123 --> 19:26.250
- This is weird.
- Yeah.

19:27.209 --> 19:30.963
Yeah. I had this thing where I wanted you
to come but I didn't think you would.

19:30.963 --> 19:34.925
Well, I had this thing where
I wasn't invited and I came anyway.

19:34.925 --> 19:37.511
No, I'm glad you did. It wouldn't
feel right if you weren't here.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.347
Plus, I wanted you to see me doing better.

19:41.890 --> 19:42.891
I'm really proud of you.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.643
I gotta go work the room.

19:44.643 --> 19:46.603
You better work.
You better work that room.

19:53.485 --> 19:55.487
Oh, my God. These kids look so young.

19:56.113 --> 19:57.698
At our age, everybody looks young.

19:58.782 --> 20:01.285
Our age? We are not peers.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.997
Okay, here it is. Guys, look,
I wanna scare the shit out of this kid,

20:04.997 --> 20:07.207
so let's try to look like badasses.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.542
You're the weak link.

20:09.168 --> 20:11.003
I know. I was psyching myself up, Paul.

20:16.466 --> 20:17.384
You're Chet, right?

20:18.468 --> 20:19.761
Where's Alice?

20:20.345 --> 20:22.014
I think your grandpa and dads are here.

20:23.557 --> 20:25.517
Oh, my God. How did you find me?

20:25.517 --> 20:27.019
We'll talk about it later. Let's go.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.605
I'm an attorney.
You know she's underage, right?

20:29.605 --> 20:33.442
- No. No, you told me you were 19.
- Yeah. Well, she's 12.

20:33.442 --> 20:35.235
- What?
- I'm not 12.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.074
You coming, Paul?

20:41.658 --> 20:43.827
I'm not done scaring him yet.

20:50.042 --> 20:52.586
There it is. Good night, Chet.

20:55.005 --> 20:56.048
Excuse me. Thanks.

20:58.383 --> 20:59.259
Sparkling cider?

20:59.259 --> 21:00.594
Well, apparently it's a dry event.

21:00.594 --> 21:02.513
Oh, fuck that.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.681
I'm sorry. It's just-- Look at him.

21:05.807 --> 21:08.143
He's not just doing okay.
He's doing great.

21:08.143 --> 21:09.228
And that makes you angry?

21:09.228 --> 21:11.230
Yes. Explain it to him.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.441
She's so mad, Sean.
How are you not getting that?

21:14.441 --> 21:17.611
I mean, I put in the work, Sean.
Like eight long years.

21:17.611 --> 21:18.654
Eight of 'em, Sean.

21:18.654 --> 21:21.907
We split up, and then he chooses to be
the best version of himself?

21:23.450 --> 21:25.327
I get it now. Now, that makes sense.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.788
You didn't know why I was mad,
you were just going along with it?

21:29.289 --> 21:30.123
Love you.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.876
- Love you.
- Okay, now I'm on board. Nico's a dick.

21:32.876 --> 21:33.961
Nico's a dick.

21:33.961 --> 21:36.255
No, Sean. Nico's a great person.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.965
Yeah, Sean, you dummy.

21:37.965 --> 21:39.883
Okay, back in five. Maybe ten.

21:40.509 --> 21:43.387
What am I doing? I should be happy
that he got his act together.

21:44.096 --> 21:46.390
I can't be some petty bitch
for the rest of my life, you know?

21:46.390 --> 21:47.808
Enjoy it for one night.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.144
Hey, everybody. Thank you all so much
for coming out tonight.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.355
Truly, from the bottom of my heart,
it means a lot.

21:53.355 --> 21:57.067
My friends, peers, loved ones,
people who brought their wallets.

21:58.694 --> 22:01.071
And especially those who
helped get me here.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.285
Oh, fuck.

22:14.543 --> 22:16.128
Did she say anything in the car?

22:17.045 --> 22:18.589
No. Not a word.

22:19.214 --> 22:24.303
Oh, man. You know, my dad
was kind of a gruff, intimidating guy.

22:24.303 --> 22:26.388
- No way.
- Stop it.

22:26.388 --> 22:31.018
I never would've got away with
any of the shit that Alice pulled tonight.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.395
What's her punishment gonna be?

22:33.395 --> 22:36.940
Nothing.
Jimmy's gonna let her off the hook.

22:37.608 --> 22:39.067
Come on. You don't know that.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.152
Yeah, I do.

22:42.446 --> 22:44.531
You've screwed up so many times,

22:44.531 --> 22:47.075
you think you don't have
the right to be upset with anybody.

22:47.659 --> 22:48.911
Christ. Look at this guy.

22:49.453 --> 22:52.206
You're pissed at him,
and he's sucking on one of your beers.

22:52.748 --> 22:54.750
This beer's actually really good.
What is it, an IPA?

22:57.461 --> 22:58.295
Boop.

22:58.879 --> 22:59.713
Boop?

22:59.713 --> 23:01.089
Yeah, boop.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.674
- Boop?
- Yeah, boop.

23:03.175 --> 23:06.428
Look, man. You hurt my feelings.
I'm gonna need some time.

23:08.639 --> 23:10.933
- Are you proud of yourself?
- Always.

23:10.933 --> 23:12.392
Yeah, good night, Brian.

23:13.519 --> 23:15.145
Okay. Yeah.

23:16.730 --> 23:17.814
- May I--
- Good night, Brian.

23:17.814 --> 23:18.899
Okay.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.652
Boop? Who says "boop?"

23:25.030 --> 23:26.657
- Yeah.
- How did that feel?

23:26.657 --> 23:29.535
Yeah, that felt good. But that's 'cause
I know that he and I are gonna be okay.

23:29.535 --> 23:32.079
It's different with Alice.
We're on shaky grounds.

23:32.746 --> 23:33.956
All the more reason.

23:34.790 --> 23:37.251
Tough talk, Paul. How's it going with Meg?

23:41.547 --> 23:42.548
Total shit show.

23:43.507 --> 23:44.508
Sorry.

23:44.508 --> 23:50.013
I'd kill to be able to be her dad again.
You still have a shot with Alice.

23:50.722 --> 23:52.307
But you gotta stop being a coward.

23:53.016 --> 23:56.812
Put the hammer down. She'll appreciate it.

23:57.396 --> 23:58.397
No, she won't.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.525
Maybe not.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.196
But you'll feel good about yourself.

24:06.905 --> 24:09.616
You know why? 'Cause it's your job.

24:12.119 --> 24:15.706
But, hey. What do I know?

24:19.710 --> 24:21.503
Somebody gotta give me a ride home.

24:25.716 --> 24:27.009
I'm the only one here, Paul.

24:27.009 --> 24:28.093
You'll do.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.387
I'm gonna go and say goodbye.

24:30.387 --> 24:32.222
- We got you.
- Thanks.

24:32.222 --> 24:34.808
Honestly, there's one person,
and I wouldn't be here without her.

24:35.601 --> 24:38.020
Might sound corny, but she's my muse.

24:40.147 --> 24:42.232
- Right on cue.
- You talking about me?

24:42.232 --> 24:43.317
Maybe.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.030
Honestly, it's a little bit embarrassing,

24:48.030 --> 24:51.825
but Nico told me that
this painting is actually me.

24:53.619 --> 24:54.620
You ready to go?

24:55.454 --> 24:56.538
- Not yet.
- Uh-oh.

24:57.206 --> 24:59.708
Hey, Nico. Hi.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.920
That painting is me.

25:02.920 --> 25:07.758
<i>Muse on a Couch</i> is me.
Check it out. What's that?

25:08.634 --> 25:10.344
Look. It's a freckle

25:10.344 --> 25:15.349
that you know about
from all the sex we had together. And--

25:15.349 --> 25:18.018
- Liz, a little help, please.
- I got you.

25:19.645 --> 25:22.814
A freckle. That freckle. Me.

25:22.814 --> 25:28.070
Freckle here. Freckle there. Freckle here.
Freckle there! That painting is me!

25:28.737 --> 25:31.615
And, Aliyah, I'm really sorry you had
to experience me like this.

25:31.615 --> 25:34.034
I think you have a sick
and cool vibe, and I love your outfit,

25:34.034 --> 25:36.703
I love your fucking earrings,
and everything about you is super tight.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.163
- Good night. Thank you.
- This is bullshit.

25:38.163 --> 25:40.415
You know what?
I shouldn't do this, but I will.

25:40.415 --> 25:41.333
No, don't.

25:41.333 --> 25:42.918
I'm not gonna kink shame,
but maybe I will.

25:42.918 --> 25:45.212
- No.
- He loves thumbs in the butt.

25:45.212 --> 25:47.714
- All right.
- That was a part of all the work I did.

25:47.714 --> 25:49.049
I put thumbs in the butt,

25:49.049 --> 25:50.717
- It was nice meeting you.
- and he loved it.

25:50.717 --> 25:53.011
Sometimes I would put two thumbs
in his butt,

25:53.011 --> 25:57.057
- and he'd say, "More, more. I want more."
- Thank you. Sorry. It was a lovely event.

25:57.057 --> 26:00.644
Lovely. I mean, y'all just--
Y'all killed this shit.

26:00.644 --> 26:02.229
The painter is a butt man.

26:03.856 --> 26:05.732
Hey. Took you a long time.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.401
Yeah, I had to go to, like,

26:07.401 --> 26:10.404
three different gas stations
to find Fun Dip for Paul.

26:11.071 --> 26:14.491
He's like a junkie now.
Keeps talking about getting his sticks.

26:14.491 --> 26:20.038
Yeah, that's my bad.
I guess all of tonight was my bad.

26:21.540 --> 26:23.542
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

26:32.801 --> 26:38.390
No it won't. Not for at least two months,
'cause you're grounded.

26:39.349 --> 26:42.227
Grounded? You can't be serious.

26:42.936 --> 26:43.770
Try me.

26:43.770 --> 26:48.442
You can't ground me. You've been
a train wreck for the last year.

26:48.442 --> 26:49.860
Okay, you know what?

26:49.860 --> 26:53.989
That may be true,
but I pay the bills, so I make the rules.

26:53.989 --> 26:57.743
From now on, you go to school,
you go to soccer practice,

26:57.743 --> 26:59.411
and then you come home. Nothing else.

26:59.411 --> 27:01.538
W-- I'm going
to Japanese Breakfast next week.

27:01.538 --> 27:03.582
Well, it looks like
you're gonna have to eat it at home.

27:03.582 --> 27:05.542
It's a band, asshole.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.420
Well, with an ironic name like that,
they must be fantastic.

27:08.420 --> 27:11.507
They fucking are. And you know what?
Mom would have never done this.

27:11.507 --> 27:12.591
Yes, she would.

27:14.510 --> 27:16.386
Yes, she would, and you fucking know it.

27:19.473 --> 27:21.058
I fucking hate you!

27:26.813 --> 27:28.565
Yeah, well, I fucking love you!
