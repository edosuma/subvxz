00:01.455 --> 00:02.855
And I think
we can both conclude

00:02.865 --> 00:05.365
that we finished Q1 with better
than expected results.

00:05.375 --> 00:07.875
And I can promise that
my performance will improve,

00:07.885 --> 00:10.685
especially if you're a little
more flexible on your end.

00:10.695 --> 00:12.715
I love it when you tlak

00:12.725 --> 00:14.525
I cannot wait to see you tonight.

00:14.927 --> 00:15.847
What are you going to wear?

00:17.077 --> 00:18.845
Think slutty grace Kelly.

00:18.913 --> 00:21.581
Oh, God bless you.
I'm picturing it right now.

00:21.649 --> 00:23.883
And the opposite of that
just walked in.

00:23.950 --> 00:25.751
- Tell Liz I said hi.
- I will.

00:25.819 --> 00:28.714
Happy Birthday, Jack.
I got you a card.

00:28.781 --> 00:32.628
It's one of those new ones
where you can record a message.

00:32.695 --> 00:34.237
Test, test, test.

00:34.305 --> 00:36.649
This is a test
for Jack's card.

00:39.085 --> 00:41.758

on these things?

00:41.826 --> 00:43.428
Whatever.
I'll definitely figure it out.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.166
Thank you, lemon.

00:45.233 --> 00:47.502
But my true present is
that exquisite ensemble.

00:47.570 --> 00:49.506
You look like
a prison weed dealer.

00:49.573 --> 00:52.947
I'm coming back from
a singles dodgeball match, okay?

00:53.015 --> 00:55.115
- Good God.
- The ymca near my apartment

00:55.183 --> 00:56.982
offers a variety
of singles activities,

00:57.050 --> 00:59.318
and I am forcing myself
to go to all of them.

00:59.386 --> 01:00.855
Well, I'm glad you're trying,

01:00.922 --> 01:01.921
but I wish
you didn't have to--

01:01.988 --> 01:03.488
lemon, are you wearing
a cup?

01:03.556 --> 01:06.527
Oh, I forgot, only guys can
get hurt there.

01:06.595 --> 01:08.329
I just wish
it were easier for you.

01:08.397 --> 01:12.334
You need an avery--
simple, fun, uncomplicated.

As my good friend

"no more drama."

Nancy, what are you

01:18.907 --> 01:20.140
It's done, Jack.

Not really.

01:49.950 --> 01:51.916
I mean, there was
one okay guy.

Eat it, bitch!

01:58.358 --> 02:01.827
What is wrong with you?
He was flirting.

Did you ever even talk
to him?

Oh, thanks, Jenna,
but you don't want to do that.

02:19.904 --> 02:21.370
No, it would be good

02:21.438 --> 02:22.938
I'm up for a role

And this is our

Uh, Nancy, this is the star

02:35.949 --> 02:37.684
Tracy, this is--

02:37.751 --> 02:38.985
I heard on the walkie-talkies

02:39.052 --> 02:40.852
that there's a redheaded milf
walking around

02:40.920 --> 02:44.222
with some executive.

02:44.290 --> 02:47.025
You know what,
that felt really good.

02:48.761 --> 02:51.228
So I'll see you at lunch.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.529
All right.

02:52.597 --> 02:54.031
Kenneth, would you please
show Mrs. dougherty--

02:54.099 --> 02:57.634
I'm sorry, um, Ms. Donovan,
to the elevator?

03:00.572 --> 03:02.173
Have we met before?

03:02.240 --> 03:04.475
You shut your mouth!

03:04.543 --> 03:07.378
Now you're having lunch?
Does Avery know about this?

03:07.445 --> 03:08.512
Lemon, the grown-up
dating world

03:08.580 --> 03:09.547

03:09.615 --> 03:11.715
Sometimes

03:11.783 --> 03:13.150
I feel like you've been
saving that one.

03:13.218 --> 03:15.085
Obviously,
this is unexpected.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.154
I really didn't think that Nancy
would ever get divorced.

03:17.221 --> 03:19.255
Why would a lady
get divorced at 50?

03:19.323 --> 03:20.523
Stick it out!

03:20.591 --> 03:22.324

03:23.726 --> 03:26.027
Yes, Nancy showing up
is a game changer.

03:26.095 --> 03:28.863
But if I blow this up now,
all three of us will suffer.

03:28.930 --> 03:30.030
So what are you gonna do?

03:30.098 --> 03:31.031
I'm going to make the most

03:31.099 --> 03:32.232
of this opportunity.

03:32.299 --> 03:33.700
I'm going to pursue
both relationships,

03:33.767 --> 03:34.767
see how they develop,

03:34.835 --> 03:36.369
and then make
an informed decision.

03:36.437 --> 03:38.438
You're gonna juggle them?
No.

You will not believe

04:02.192 --> 04:05.860
A guy on the subway
just called me a biggledeeboo.

04:05.928 --> 04:06.961
What's a biggledeeboo?

04:07.029 --> 04:08.662
- It's an 18th-century word

04:08.730 --> 04:10.064
for "dark-skinned moor."

04:10.131 --> 04:12.632
I've learned the word "black"
in every language,

04:12.700 --> 04:14.534

to be offended.

04:28.214 --> 04:29.781
How can racism be back

04:29.849 --> 04:31.149
when we elected
a black president?

04:31.217 --> 04:33.618
Barry obams is the one
who brought it back!

04:33.686 --> 04:35.386
So you're saying
that racism is back

04:35.454 --> 04:37.922
because white people
no longer feel sorry for us?

04:37.989 --> 04:39.123
Hey, something's going on.

04:39.190 --> 04:40.757

That's not good.

07:47.626 --> 07:50.895
Is my presence on this staff
tokenism?

07:50.963 --> 07:54.933
Toofer, you are an
invaluable member of our team.

07:55.001 --> 07:57.168
Then why are my paychecks
a different color than Frank's?

07:57.236 --> 08:01.339
Because your salary
does not come out

08:01.407 --> 08:02.774
of our budget.

08:02.842 --> 08:04.909
Look, toof, you provide

08:04.977 --> 08:06.945
a point of view

08:07.013 --> 08:11.016

from bothering us.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.251
I do not want a job
I did not earn.

08:13.319 --> 08:17.255
I am about to utter two words

No, I'm sorry.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.178
You can't set me up like that.
Don't quit.

08:21.246 --> 08:23.180

08:27.052 --> 08:30.588
Wow, you look like

08:30.655 --> 08:32.456
And you look like you won

collect $10.

08:36.528 --> 08:39.063
You sure you don't mind just
having a drink up here?

08:39.131 --> 08:41.232
I walked all the way
to battery park today

08:41.299 --> 08:43.100

08:43.168 --> 08:45.836

08:45.904 --> 08:48.339
Oh, no, are you kidding me?
At those prices?

08:48.407 --> 08:51.675
Left over from
my amtrak ride.

08:51.743 --> 08:52.910
That's my Donovan.

08:52.978 --> 08:54.945
So listen, uh,

08:55.013 --> 08:57.014
I know we've waited
a long time

08:57.082 --> 08:58.416
for me to be single,

08:58.483 --> 09:00.551
and I really want
our first evening together

09:00.619 --> 09:01.919
to be special and--

09:01.987 --> 09:04.388
oh, God, this is so queer.

09:04.456 --> 09:07.224
I guess what I'm trying
to say is

09:07.292 --> 09:09.560
can we wait until the morning
to fool around?

09:09.628 --> 09:12.463
'Cause I'm exhausted,
and I got the night bloats.

09:12.531 --> 09:15.699
Yes, the morning.
I'm exhausted too.

09:15.767 --> 09:17.601
Let's just watch tv.

09:17.669 --> 09:19.904
There's a Lee Marvin marathon
on Turner classics.

09:19.971 --> 09:22.406
I thought you said this wasn't
going to be sexual.

09:24.843 --> 09:29.380
Oh, this is perfect.

09:35.290 --> 09:36.149
I should take this.

09:37.769 --> 09:38.736
Is everything okay?

09:38.804 --> 09:40.838
Is everything okay?

09:40.906 --> 09:43.274
Here are the bullet points:
Jeter's apartment.

09:43.342 --> 09:44.575
We're playing beer pong.

09:44.643 --> 09:46.777
It's New York Yankees
versus former mayors.

09:46.845 --> 09:49.580
I got 10 grand on the mayors.
Get down here.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.716
Oh, come on, dinkins!
You're killin' me!

09:51.783 --> 09:54.185
- Oh...
- What's going on?

09:54.252 --> 09:58.756
It's work.
I've gotta go.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.961
Uh, no.
I have to go. I'm sorry.

10:04.029 --> 10:06.764
I'll call you.

10:06.832 --> 10:08.566
Don't work too hard.

10:12.771 --> 10:16.073
How's your episode
of <i>three's company</i> going?

10:16.141 --> 10:18.209
Like <i>three's company,</i>
it's titillating,

10:18.276 --> 10:20.111
yet anxiety-producing.

10:20.178 --> 10:22.046
I need your help,
Janet.

10:22.114 --> 10:24.749
Aw, man,
being Janet sucks!

10:24.816 --> 10:26.951
After the party last night,
I went to Nancy's hotel room.

10:27.019 --> 10:29.653
Then Avery called and made
an offer I couldn't refuse.

10:29.721 --> 10:32.423
Ew, were you with
both of them on one night?

10:32.491 --> 10:35.059
You are officially
a John mayer-style garbage--

10:35.127 --> 10:36.927
I didn't have sex
with anybody.

10:36.995 --> 10:39.130
You were right, lemon.
I don't think I can do this.

10:39.197 --> 10:41.298
Whichever one I'm with,
I think she's the one.

10:41.366 --> 10:43.601
How do you choose between
Lee Marvin and Derek jeter?

10:43.668 --> 10:45.169
On looks, Lee Marvin.

10:45.237 --> 10:47.138
I feel like I'm being
pulled apart,

10:47.205 --> 10:48.339
and I need your help.

10:48.407 --> 10:50.975
Today I'm going
to the boat show with Nancy.

10:51.043 --> 10:52.276
Tonight is my birthday dinner
with Avery.

10:52.744 --> 10:55.008
I hate the idea of Nancy
having dinner alone

10:55.155 --> 10:55.983
at the hotel tonight,

10:56.170 --> 10:58.004
so I told her that you wanted
to take her out.

10:58.072 --> 11:00.306
No, I have singles
wine and cheese tonight.

11:00.374 --> 11:02.042
Then take Nancy with you.

11:02.109 --> 11:03.176
You know what,
this whole thing is unfair.

11:03.244 --> 11:04.811
You're juggling
two beautiful women

11:04.879 --> 11:06.813
while I have to pay to have
kickballs whipped at me.

11:06.881 --> 11:09.215
This is gender inequity
out the Yang!

11:09.283 --> 11:10.483
This has nothing to do

11:10.551 --> 11:11.885
with the slight difference
in our genders.

11:11.952 --> 11:13.253
Yes, it does.

11:13.320 --> 11:15.655
The older <i>you</i> get,
the more distinguished you are.

11:15.723 --> 11:17.657
Meanwhile,
I'm reading a book called

11:17.725 --> 11:19.659
<i>hiding your arms,</i>
<i>hiding your anger:</i>

11:19.727 --> 11:21.528
<i>Dating over 35.</i>

11:21.595 --> 11:22.996
Lemon, I am successful
romantically

11:23.064 --> 11:25.765
because I am confident,
open, and positive.

11:25.833 --> 11:27.200
You are negative,
pessimistic,

11:27.268 --> 11:29.035
and in danger of becoming
permanently sour.

11:29.103 --> 11:31.738
Is this you asking me
for a favor?

11:31.806 --> 11:33.406
Look, if I don't handle
this situation right,

11:33.474 --> 11:35.075
I'm going to lose both
of these women.

11:35.142 --> 11:38.611
And even worse,
they're both going to lose me.

11:38.679 --> 11:41.347
Okay, fine.
I'll do it.

11:41.415 --> 11:44.284
Ugh--
ow, my eyes are stuck.

11:44.351 --> 11:46.719
Help me!

11:46.787 --> 11:48.955
Okay.

11:49.023 --> 11:50.890
I can't believe toofer quit!

11:50.958 --> 11:52.058
Do you have any idea
how much paperwork

11:52.126 --> 11:53.526
I have to fill out
because of this?

11:53.594 --> 11:54.761
He left with his I.D.

11:54.829 --> 11:56.196
Tracy! Tracy, trey.

11:56.263 --> 11:58.765
Buddy, will you call toofer
and talk some sense into him?

11:58.833 --> 12:00.300
Oh, yeah, just ask
the black guy,

12:00.367 --> 12:01.468
'cause we all know each other.

12:01.535 --> 12:03.603
Pete, could you tell
a bald eagle

12:03.671 --> 12:06.773
to stop scaring me
at zoos?

12:06.841 --> 12:07.774
You know, I've been wanting
to say this

12:07.842 --> 12:09.075
for a few seconds now.

12:09.143 --> 12:11.478
This workplace has become
a hotbed

12:11.545 --> 12:12.902
of old-school racism.

12:13.171 --> 12:15.005
Come on, trey,
no one here is racist.

12:15.073 --> 12:16.607
Oh, yeah? How come
I'm always forced to play

12:16.674 --> 12:19.243
<i>ridicarus</i> characters
that don't <i>enununciate</i> well.

12:19.310 --> 12:21.078
Uh...

12:21.146 --> 12:23.580
So what?
Look at italians.

12:23.648 --> 12:25.482
We're always portrayed
either as goombahs or guidos,

12:25.550 --> 12:28.652
but we don't care because we're
successful members of society.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.388
So maybe your problem is that
you're finally being treated

12:31.456 --> 12:32.923
like everybody else.

12:32.991 --> 12:34.091
Nah, you could play it off,

12:34.159 --> 12:35.826
but I know you're all
secretly mad

12:35.894 --> 12:39.163
'cause we finally have
a black Disney princess.

12:39.230 --> 12:40.631
You know, there actually
hasn't been a white princess

12:40.698 --> 12:42.066
since 1991.

12:42.133 --> 12:44.334
Tiana, mulan, pocahontas,
jasmine--wow, she's right!

12:44.402 --> 12:46.370
There are little blonde girls
in this country

12:46.438 --> 12:47.905
who have no idea
they can be beautiful.

12:47.972 --> 12:50.407
That's why I started
"jenna's kids."

12:50.475 --> 12:52.309
It's a summer camp
that teaches pretty blonde girls

12:52.377 --> 12:54.845
how to be mean.

12:54.913 --> 12:57.815
You, call toofer.
Beg him to come back.

12:57.882 --> 13:00.150
- Absolutely not.
- Of course not.

13:00.218 --> 13:03.253
The aryan hates and fears
the African man,

13:03.321 --> 13:05.756
as we so clearly saw
in the <i>blade</i> movies.

13:05.824 --> 13:07.691
What? No,
I didn't want toofer to quit,

13:07.759 --> 13:09.293
but I respect his decision.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.761
As a woman in this business--

13:10.829 --> 13:12.529
- oh, stop that!
- Shut up, Liz.

13:12.597 --> 13:14.932
In this world, I have never
received special treatment,

13:14.999 --> 13:16.667
at work or in love.

13:16.734 --> 13:18.936
So why should anybody else?

13:19.003 --> 13:20.404
Oh, liz--

13:20.472 --> 13:22.739
I love coming here.
You know,

13:22.807 --> 13:23.774
this is one of the only
restaurants in America

13:23.842 --> 13:24.908
with a veal tank.

13:24.976 --> 13:27.044
It just tastes better
when you pick your own.

13:27.112 --> 13:30.047
You know, Jack,

13:30.115 --> 13:33.407
I think I know the real reason
you were acting weird

13:33.510 --> 13:34.676
about doing the red carpet
with me.

13:35.956 --> 13:37.857
Okay.

13:37.925 --> 13:39.926
You're self-conscious
about our age difference,

13:39.993 --> 13:42.028
and you thought you'd look old
standing next to me.

13:42.096 --> 13:44.365
I see.
You're very perceptive.

13:44.378 --> 13:45.545
I get why
it's on your mind,

13:45.613 --> 13:47.814
what, with your birthday
and my amazing skin.

13:47.882 --> 13:50.383
And sure, people
in this restaurant

13:50.451 --> 13:51.418
might think you're my dad...

13:51.485 --> 13:53.186
Or that you're
my prostitute.

13:53.254 --> 13:56.423
Exactly.
But what does it matter?

13:56.490 --> 13:59.793
Uh, maybe it does matter.

13:59.860 --> 14:01.561
I mean, yeah,
if I'd met you 20 years ago--

14:01.629 --> 14:03.330
well, not you, because
you would have been 16,

14:03.397 --> 14:05.932
which is, of course...
Wrong.

14:06.000 --> 14:08.501
I'm just saying, are we
kidding ourselves with this?

14:08.569 --> 14:10.303
I'm 51 years old.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.339
Do you even know
who Lee Marvin is?

14:12.406 --> 14:14.574
The sportscaster
who bites ladies.

14:14.642 --> 14:15.842
Who cares?

14:15.910 --> 14:18.478
Then again, if I were
with someone my own age,

14:18.546 --> 14:20.647
I'd miss out on
a lot of things I want.

14:20.715 --> 14:22.582
I'd never have a family...
Jack?

14:22.650 --> 14:24.017
Relax.

14:24.085 --> 14:25.785
We've only been together
a month.

14:25.853 --> 14:27.620
We don't need to worry
about this stuff now.

14:27.688 --> 14:31.191
Especially not
on your birthday.

14:31.258 --> 14:32.892
Are these the cufflinks--

14:32.960 --> 14:33.927
Reagan was buried in.

14:33.994 --> 14:35.395
Don't ask how I got them.

14:35.463 --> 14:38.798
But I do know the access code
to his pyramid.

14:38.866 --> 14:40.533
Oh, Avery,
this is too much.

14:40.601 --> 14:42.569
No, it's perfect, Jack.

14:42.636 --> 14:45.238
Someday you'll be
as a great a man as he was.

14:45.306 --> 14:48.308
I do like jelly beans.

14:50.005 --> 14:52.839
Look at me, I'm at a
singles event in New York City.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.400
La-di-dah.

14:54.468 --> 14:56.002
I mean, sure,
it's a little bright in here,

14:56.070 --> 14:58.404
and they could have rescheduled
that youth karate class...

14:58.472 --> 14:59.672
Yes, sensei.

14:59.740 --> 15:01.140
But this is fun!

15:01.208 --> 15:03.242
Oh, come on, it's pathetic.

15:03.310 --> 15:04.577
Why am I doing this?

15:04.645 --> 15:06.979
'Cause you're living life.

15:07.047 --> 15:09.482
Hey, how you doing?
You see <i>avatar?</i>

15:09.550 --> 15:11.317
Yeah.
That new 3-d is amazing.

15:11.385 --> 15:13.019
Yeah, I don't know,
I found myself rooting

15:13.087 --> 15:15.922
for our boys in uniform,
not those blue hippies.

15:15.989 --> 15:17.190
But full disclosure,

15:17.257 --> 15:19.125
I had a couple of drinks
prior to.

15:19.193 --> 15:20.793
You know Liz?

15:20.861 --> 15:22.528
Yeah, I thought
that marine robot thing--

15:22.596 --> 15:23.529
they weren't marines.

15:23.597 --> 15:24.530
Some of them were
former marines,

15:24.598 --> 15:25.531
but they were mercenaries

15:25.599 --> 15:26.666
working for
a space mining company.

15:26.733 --> 15:30.804
All right.
See you later.

15:31.371 --> 15:32.338
What are you doing?

15:32.406 --> 15:33.639
I was warming him up
for you,

15:33.707 --> 15:35.775
and you start talking
about space mining?

15:35.843 --> 15:37.477
What, do you just want
to sit around and be wrong?

15:37.544 --> 15:40.413
Come on, Liz, every man
in this room is single.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.715
Who do you want to meet?

15:42.783 --> 15:44.250
Nobody.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.519
I mean, that guy has a beard.
Who knows what's under there?

15:46.587 --> 15:48.621
Tattoo guy,
too promiscuous.

15:48.689 --> 15:51.357
T-shirt tucked into jeans--
pbbbt!

15:51.425 --> 15:53.226
Oh, that guy looks like
he'd just be mean to me.

15:53.293 --> 15:55.528
God, Liz,
you're so negative.

15:55.596 --> 15:57.563
Oh, now you just sound
like Jack.

15:57.631 --> 15:58.798
Hey, I'm no
relationship expert.

15:58.866 --> 16:00.500
The last time I used
a birth control device,

16:00.567 --> 16:02.668
it was the '70s, and it looked
like soap on a rope.

16:02.736 --> 16:05.104
But every time you say
what you don't want,

16:05.172 --> 16:07.438
you sound like a cranky cow,
and you're not that.

16:07.987 --> 16:09.747
You're smart and you're fun.

16:09.815 --> 16:11.983
So stop talking about
what you don't want,

16:12.051 --> 16:13.718
and start figuring out
what you do want.

16:13.786 --> 16:16.087
And then go get it.

16:16.155 --> 16:18.456
Jerem, look how drunk I am,

16:18.524 --> 16:20.792
and how full of cheese
my mouth is!

16:20.860 --> 16:23.094
That's not
that much cheese.

16:29.135 --> 16:30.502
No, no, don't.

16:30.569 --> 16:33.471
No, it's okay.
I don't want to hurt you.

16:33.539 --> 16:35.573
But I'll tell you
what I do want.

16:35.641 --> 16:37.976
I want someone
who will be monogamous

16:38.043 --> 16:39.277
and nice to his mother.

16:39.345 --> 16:42.113
And I want someone
who likes musicals,

16:42.181 --> 16:45.817
but knows to just shut his mouth
when I'm watching <i>lost.</i>

16:45.885 --> 16:50.188
And I want someone who thinks
being really into cars is lame,

16:50.256 --> 16:52.190
and strip clubs are gross.

16:52.258 --> 16:56.094
I want someone who will
actually empty the dishwasher

16:56.162 --> 16:58.530
instead of just
taking out forks as needed,

16:58.597 --> 16:59.697
like I do.

16:59.765 --> 17:03.201
I want someone with
clean hands and feet,

17:03.269 --> 17:06.637
and beefy forearms,
like a damn Disney prince.

17:06.704 --> 17:10.074
And I want him
to genuinely like me,

17:10.142 --> 17:12.076
even when I'm old.

17:12.144 --> 17:14.746
And that's what I want.

17:16.315 --> 17:17.848
You making much English.

17:17.916 --> 17:21.553
This is fun
alcoholics meeting!

17:22.385 --> 17:23.304
Yeah.

17:29.512 --> 17:30.512
Well, well, well.

17:30.530 --> 17:32.431
Never got a hand up--
is that right, Liz lemon?

17:32.499 --> 17:34.834
What? Come on, Pete,
I'm in a good mood.

17:34.901 --> 17:36.402
And it's over!

17:36.469 --> 17:39.338
While trying to find toofer's
dental records in personnel,

17:39.406 --> 17:43.008
down on the basement mezzanine,

17:43.076 --> 17:46.679
I pulled your file.

17:46.746 --> 17:48.047
"Elizabeth"--

17:48.114 --> 17:49.415
I don't know how to pronounce
your middle name--

17:49.482 --> 17:50.516
"lemon."

17:52.118 --> 17:53.285
You attended
the university of Maryland

17:53.353 --> 17:56.789
on a partial competitive
jazz dance scholarship.

18:01.027 --> 18:02.595
So?

18:02.662 --> 18:05.064
So ncaa competitive
jazz dance was created

18:05.131 --> 18:06.365
as part of title ix.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.134
You were able to pay for college
because of a program

18:09.202 --> 18:10.603
that favored women.

18:10.670 --> 18:12.872
Favored women
to correct an imbalance.

18:12.939 --> 18:14.773
There's more.

18:14.841 --> 18:16.842
You were only hired
by the second city

18:16.910 --> 18:18.410
because they needed someone
who could remember

18:18.478 --> 18:19.778
to feed the theater cat!

18:19.846 --> 18:21.714
Oh, no...Otis.

18:21.781 --> 18:23.015
And you're gonna hate
this one.

18:23.083 --> 18:25.684
The only reason nbc picked up
<i>the girlie show</i>

18:25.752 --> 18:27.987
is because of the flak they got
from women's groups

18:28.054 --> 18:31.090
after airing the action drama
<i>bitch hunter.</i>

18:34.127 --> 18:36.629
Happy Birthday, bitches!

18:42.011 --> 18:43.109
Oh, my God!

18:43.809 --> 18:44.905
I'm no better than toofer...

18:46.077 --> 18:48.845
Or lutz, with his bs
inuit ancestry,

18:48.913 --> 18:50.514
or you, whose dad was
in the masons

18:50.581 --> 18:52.048
with Dave garroway.

18:52.116 --> 18:53.250
I shouldn't be here.

18:53.317 --> 18:55.285
This is America.

18:55.353 --> 18:56.920
None of us are supposed
to be here.

18:56.988 --> 19:00.056
I need to dance this out.

19:02.000 --> 19:08.074

Jack, would <i>tgs</i> have gotten
on tv if I was a dude?

19:12.270 --> 19:14.538
No, it was
affirmative action.

19:14.605 --> 19:16.106
Why do you think your checks
aren't the same color

19:16.174 --> 19:18.308
as Howie mandel's?

19:19.510 --> 19:22.245
Two amazing gifts
from two amazing women.

19:22.313 --> 19:25.382
Each gift symbolic of
the woman who gave it to you.

19:25.450 --> 19:26.983
One, the past--

19:27.051 --> 19:29.286
a connection to home
and the man that you were.

19:29.353 --> 19:31.455
The other, the future...
The promise--

19:31.522 --> 19:33.290
yes, lemon, I get it.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.528
I can't let this
go on any longer.

19:38.596 --> 19:40.997
I choose...Avery!

19:41.065 --> 19:43.867
Right? Yes.

19:43.935 --> 19:45.068
Okay, but are you sure
it's not just because

19:45.136 --> 19:46.203
you saw Avery last?

19:46.270 --> 19:49.473
No. Well...

19:49.540 --> 19:52.175
Hey, Liz, how'd it go
with the guys at dodgeball?

19:52.243 --> 19:53.677
You let one in?

19:53.744 --> 19:56.613
Into your <i>heart,</i> I mean.
God.

19:56.681 --> 19:58.782
Oh. It actually went okay.

19:58.850 --> 20:01.325
I'm sorry you and I couldn't
get together last night.

20:01.502 --> 20:04.621
Yeah, me too.
But now I gotta run.

20:05.266 --> 20:07.800
But what do you say I come back
in a couple of weeks,

20:07.868 --> 20:10.236
I cook you a pot roast,
we drink too much wine,

20:10.304 --> 20:12.572
and see how it goes?

20:15.909 --> 20:17.577
That sounds amazing.

20:22.683 --> 20:24.183
We'll be keeping an eye
on this story as it develops,

20:24.251 --> 20:27.120
but it's clearly
a conflict of interests.

20:27.187 --> 20:28.454
And at the risk
of editorializing,

20:28.522 --> 20:29.922
I am personally outraged.

20:45.906 --> 20:47.706
Hey, what are you
doing here?

20:47.917 --> 20:50.218
Liz has invited me back
as a budgeted employee.

20:50.286 --> 20:52.287
Apparently, I am
the only one among us

20:52.355 --> 20:53.288
who can spell.

20:53.356 --> 20:54.623
Welcome back, James.

20:54.690 --> 20:55.724
Hang on, who's James?

20:55.792 --> 20:57.759
As a condition
of my re-employment,

20:57.827 --> 20:59.961
I have requested that
I no longer be called "toofer."

21:00.029 --> 21:02.330
Great!
New nickname suggestions. Go!

21:02.398 --> 21:04.032
Victoria q. Nerdballs.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.034
- Kanye East.
- Super virgin!

21:06.102 --> 21:07.669
Splock.
Short for "black Spock."

21:07.737 --> 21:08.804
Three-fer,
'cause you're also gay.

21:08.871 --> 21:10.438
Okay, fine, fine!
Toofer.

21:10.506 --> 21:11.740
I'll just go back
to toofer.

21:11.808 --> 21:14.309
Yay!
Welcome back!
