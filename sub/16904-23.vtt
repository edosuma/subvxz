WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.418
Alright!

00:03.419 --> 00:06.018
Now that the popsicle's mounted,
we've got ourselves a tongue depressor

00:06.150 --> 00:07.418
I want you to look at these
cold sores...

00:07.419 --> 00:08.818
I get them when I'm stressed-out

00:09.008 --> 00:11.818
Nothing to be ashamed of...
I get them from prostitutes.

00:11.918 --> 00:13.618
It's been a hard couple of months,

00:13.718 --> 00:15.418
Work has been crazy,

00:15.470 --> 00:16.786
and I went through
a bad breakup.

00:16.838 --> 00:17.988
And then there was
this plastic bag

00:18.055 --> 00:19.189
that represented my death...

00:19.257 --> 00:20.824
sounds like you could use
a little R&R...

00:20.892 --> 00:22.142
Rum and ritalin.

00:22.226 --> 00:23.777
Actually, I was hoping
you'd just have an ointment

00:23.845 --> 00:25.395
- for my mouth.
- Gross.

00:25.462 --> 00:26.480
'Cause I'm dealing
with the stress thing.

00:26.547 --> 00:27.531
Over the break-up,

00:27.598 --> 00:28.815
I'm renting a cottage
out in the Hamptons.

00:28.900 --> 00:31.134
There's just four things
I want to do this summer...

00:31.202 --> 00:33.003
be outdoors,
wear shapeless clothing,

00:33.070 --> 00:35.105
do some mindless activity
like gardening,

00:35.173 --> 00:36.406
and learn Spanish.

00:36.457 --> 00:38.041
There are four things
I want to do this summer.

00:38.108 --> 00:40.276
But they're roommates,
so it's tricky.

00:40.328 --> 00:42.779
All right,
here is a prescription

00:42.847 --> 00:44.280
for your cold sores,

00:44.332 --> 00:46.466
and here's a blank one
for the weekend.

00:46.551 --> 00:47.751
Now, one final thing.

00:47.818 --> 00:49.319
Why aren't you wearing pants?

00:49.387 --> 00:50.987
The other doctor told me
to take them off.

00:51.055 --> 00:52.255
Other doctor?

00:52.323 --> 00:54.524
That's my brother Randy.

00:54.592 --> 00:57.010
Tomorrow he's going to jail
for the rest of his life.

00:57.094 --> 00:58.628
Good one, Randy!

00:58.679 --> 01:02.182
Hey, you want to go
to taco bell for lunch?

- Hey...
- Stop right there.

01:23.871 --> 01:25.622
I know that people
are feeling sorry for me

01:25.706 --> 01:28.041
because my wife was kidnapped
by Kim Jong-Il.

01:28.108 --> 01:30.276
- I know...
- But I do not need your pity.

01:30.344 --> 01:33.379
And I am tired of hearing
that tone of voice.

01:33.447 --> 01:34.981
- Aw...
- Hey...

01:35.049 --> 01:36.616
Hey, buddy...

01:36.684 --> 01:38.618
Hey, I know what
you're going through.

01:38.686 --> 01:40.854
I once kidnapped a woman.

01:40.921 --> 01:42.388
I know...

01:42.439 --> 01:44.424
- Stop talking like that, Lemon.
- I'm trying to,

01:44.492 --> 01:46.392
but I'm kind of locked in,
sweetie.

01:46.460 --> 01:48.862
The voice is
controlling <i>me</i> now.

01:48.929 --> 01:50.029
Help me?

01:50.097 --> 01:52.365
Look, obviously
this has been difficult.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.133
I'm not sleeping.

01:54.201 --> 01:55.601
Last night I sat
in front of the TV

01:55.653 --> 01:58.671
and ate an entire carton
of foie gras.

01:58.739 --> 02:02.242
I can hardly drink
my morning shower scotch.

02:02.309 --> 02:03.610
I miss Avery.

02:03.677 --> 02:05.411
It's the little things
I miss most.

02:05.462 --> 02:06.963
On a day like this,

02:07.047 --> 02:09.014
we would go to Strawberry Fields
in Central Park

02:09.083 --> 02:12.452
and kick hippies' hacky sacks
into the bushes.

02:12.520 --> 02:16.189
Look, you need to reset
and try to feel normal again.

02:16.257 --> 02:18.491
Normal? I don't know
what normal is anymore.

02:18.559 --> 02:20.560
"Normal" is a woman and a woman

02:20.627 --> 02:22.478
getting married
and having a child.

02:22.563 --> 02:23.630
- What?
- Is me being a bummer

02:23.697 --> 02:24.814
helping you
feel like your old self?

02:24.899 --> 02:26.516
- Keep going.
- Bush is a war criminal!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.434
There's so much texting
going on these days

02:28.485 --> 02:29.936
and no communicating.

02:30.004 --> 02:31.020
Carbon tax!

02:31.105 --> 02:32.238
Please leave!

02:32.306 --> 02:33.973
That's the spirit.

02:36.527 --> 02:37.827
Well, I'm off.

02:37.912 --> 02:40.029
- Have a good summer, Jenna.
- Oh, I will.

02:40.114 --> 02:41.664
Do you remember
when I performed

02:41.749 --> 02:42.849
during halftime
at the Wool Bowl?

02:42.917 --> 02:44.317
It was on ESPN-34.

02:59.967 --> 03:01.301
The sponsors
were so happy with me

03:01.368 --> 03:04.270
they're now naming me
the new celebrity face of wool.

03:04.338 --> 03:05.838
How exciting!

03:05.890 --> 03:08.892
Every year my aunt sends me
a wool sweater for Christmas.

03:08.976 --> 03:12.211
We get it, Aunt Alice.
You're a sheep.

03:12.279 --> 03:14.347
Also, this is very lucrative.

03:14.398 --> 03:17.350
Paul and I can finally buy
that timeshare in Betasten Bos,

03:17.418 --> 03:20.019
Amsterdam's premier
private sex garden.

03:20.070 --> 03:21.688
They have
genetically altered men there

03:24.291 --> 03:26.376
Okay. Well, good-bye,

03:26.460 --> 03:30.229
my closest female friend.

03:31.432 --> 03:33.066
Oh, my God.

03:33.133 --> 03:35.718
The season's over.
Why are you losers still here?

03:35.803 --> 03:37.086
Final melee, Liz.

03:37.171 --> 03:38.204
It's the last game
of the season

03:38.272 --> 03:40.073
and no one wants to lose.

03:40.140 --> 03:41.975
You have no summer plans?

03:42.042 --> 03:44.077
Well, David Eggers and I
are designing a new font.

03:44.144 --> 03:45.311
Ugh, shut up.

03:45.379 --> 03:47.847
Frank, you have a girlfriend.

03:47.898 --> 03:49.248
And Lynn wants me
to give up video games

03:49.316 --> 03:50.750
'cause she thinks
I need to grow up.

03:50.818 --> 03:52.151
How's this for growing up?

03:52.219 --> 03:53.252
Last night for dinner

03:53.320 --> 03:56.489
I put milk in my Apple Jacks.

03:56.557 --> 03:58.891
Ha! I distracted you,
and you died.

03:58.943 --> 04:00.559
- Game over.
- No, I shot my bazooka

04:00.611 --> 04:02.929
at the ground to kill myself
'cause Toofer had me cornered.

04:02.997 --> 04:05.064
Now I respawn and start over.

04:05.132 --> 04:06.532
So you're killing yourself

04:06.600 --> 04:08.451
rather than let
someone else win?

04:08.535 --> 04:09.802
That's why everyone
has zero kills

04:09.870 --> 04:11.871
and we've been playing
for 18 hours.

04:11.939 --> 04:14.240
I'm wearing a diaper,
like a baby would.

04:14.291 --> 04:16.759
Wow. I can't wait
to get out of here.

04:16.844 --> 04:20.262
For three months.
It's gonna be glorious.

and I've got some bruschetta
and white wine open.

04:33.761 --> 04:37.063
- Why don't you come over?
- I'm alive!

04:38.432 --> 04:41.300
All I have left is to pay
the fine that I incurred

04:41.368 --> 04:42.969
for committing a hate crime

04:43.037 --> 04:46.639
against what the city is
now claiming was a Jewish tree.

Mm.

Jenna, this is a great day

05:00.921 --> 05:02.155

05:02.222 --> 05:03.489
Well, I am very proud

05:03.557 --> 05:05.558
to be your new spokeswoman.

anal rejuvenation clinic.

05:10.297 --> 05:13.766

05:13.834 --> 05:15.735
Yes, well, about that.

05:15.802 --> 05:18.071
Jenna...

05:18.138 --> 05:20.873
Wool is a wholesome fabric,

05:20.941 --> 05:23.910
which is why your contract
includes a morality clause.

about publicity like this.

05:37.157 --> 05:39.625
No, Eugene,
that's not just some guy

Is he a cross dresser?

05:45.265 --> 05:48.034
Goodness, no!

06:31.879 --> 06:32.845
Excellent.

I should warn you...

This had better be
a very normal dinner.

Sherry, who was at the door?

06:57.871 --> 06:58.971
Kenneth, what are you doing?

06:59.039 --> 07:00.807
Well, I know
your wife was kidnapped

07:00.874 --> 07:02.141
by some
convenience store owners,

07:02.209 --> 07:03.576
and I'm real sorry about that.

07:03.644 --> 07:04.844
I'm not looking for pity.

07:04.912 --> 07:07.580
Pity? Oh, sir,
back in Stone Mountain,

07:07.648 --> 07:09.916
people lose their spouses
all the time.

07:09.983 --> 07:12.618
Mumps, hill people attacks,

07:12.686 --> 07:15.655
cave collapses,
both business and residential.

07:15.722 --> 07:16.989
Continuing my list...

07:17.057 --> 07:18.858
Kenneth, what do you want?

07:18.926 --> 07:20.359
When someone needs help,

07:20.427 --> 07:22.361
we don't waste time
feeling sorry for 'em.

07:22.429 --> 07:23.763
We help them.

07:23.831 --> 07:27.366
And you seem like you
could use a home-cooked meal.

07:31.104 --> 07:32.872
Oh, that smells delicious.

07:32.939 --> 07:35.158
It's an old
Parcell family recipe.

07:35.242 --> 07:37.510
But I like to replace
the Union soldier meat

07:37.578 --> 07:39.512
with boiled potatoes.

07:39.580 --> 07:40.963
I haven't eaten at this table

07:41.048 --> 07:44.050
since Avery's been gone.

07:44.117 --> 07:45.451
That was her chair.

- No, please sit.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.926
Liz? It's Tracy!
From work!

08:26.994 --> 08:28.194
What are you doing here?

08:28.262 --> 08:29.879
I just bought everything
around this house.

08:29.963 --> 08:32.181
It's supposed to be
a nice area,

08:32.265 --> 08:35.333
except for the "new element"
everyone keeps talking about.

08:35.385 --> 08:36.885
Look, I got a long night

08:36.970 --> 08:38.304
of shooting guns in the air
ahead of me.

08:38.355 --> 08:40.022
Do you mind
if I take a nap here?

08:40.107 --> 08:42.357
Of course!
You're my neighbor.

08:42.442 --> 08:45.278
I wanted a normal summer,
and chaos is my normal.

08:45.345 --> 08:46.946
If I start screaming
in my sleep,

08:47.014 --> 08:48.281
do not wake me up!

08:48.348 --> 08:50.616
I will attack you!

08:53.587 --> 08:55.854
Wake me up!

08:55.906 --> 08:57.540
Free me from this!

09:05.559 --> 09:07.030
Ah, Kenneth...

09:07.031 --> 09:08.699
Thank you
for dinner last night.

09:08.766 --> 09:10.033
It was nice to hear
a woman's laugh

09:10.101 --> 09:11.118
in the house again.

09:12.603 --> 09:14.304
You're bad.

09:14.372 --> 09:16.006
I thought maybe
we could do it again tonight.

09:16.074 --> 09:18.292
Oh, sir, I'd love to,
but I can't.

09:18.376 --> 09:20.010
- Why not?
- Well, I have to work.

09:20.078 --> 09:21.345
Now that the crew is gone,

09:21.412 --> 09:23.330
I like to give everything
a good spring cleaning,

09:23.414 --> 09:24.648
starting in the bathroom.

09:24.716 --> 09:25.983
There's a lot of drawings

09:26.050 --> 09:27.484
of Ms. Maroney eating celery

09:27.552 --> 09:29.786
that men are giving to her
with their hips.

09:29.854 --> 09:30.954
I see.

09:31.022 --> 09:33.056
Well, another time, perhaps.

09:33.124 --> 09:35.225
I'll just be alone...

09:35.293 --> 09:36.793
In a house full of memories.

09:36.861 --> 09:40.180
My house is full
of white cockroaches.

09:43.101 --> 09:44.518
Hi, sweetie!

09:44.602 --> 09:46.820
I got you
an early anniversary present.

09:46.905 --> 09:48.505
It's a new leash for
when I walk you through the park

09:48.573 --> 09:50.073
like a dog.

09:50.141 --> 09:53.410
The weather's supposed to be
nice and muddy tomorrow...

09:53.478 --> 09:55.145
- What's wrong?
- Look...

09:55.213 --> 09:56.647
I'm the face of wool now.

09:56.714 --> 09:58.148
I need to maintain
a certain image.

09:58.216 --> 10:00.517
So, what,
we can't be ourselves?

10:00.585 --> 10:01.852
Just not in public.

10:01.920 --> 10:03.670
We can do whatever
we want here.

10:03.755 --> 10:06.123
Except tonight.

10:06.191 --> 10:08.225
Mr. Gremby is coming over
for dinner.

10:08.293 --> 10:10.060
Eugene Gremby
from the wool council?

10:10.128 --> 10:11.995
- Tonight?
- I just want him to meet you

10:12.046 --> 10:13.430
and see us together.

10:13.498 --> 10:16.133
Then he'll get it.
He'll understand what we have.

10:16.201 --> 10:17.834
But the Grembys
are pretty conservative.

10:17.902 --> 10:19.269
Maybe you should change.

10:19.337 --> 10:21.939
Really? This is
a conservative top, Jenna.

10:22.006 --> 10:23.774
And I hate to be
the stereotypical man,

10:23.841 --> 10:27.010
but this is my home
and I wanna wear this blouse.

10:27.078 --> 10:29.079
Paul, please.
You need to change.

10:29.147 --> 10:31.415
Okay, I'll change.

10:31.482 --> 10:33.417
And I'll cancel
the sitter for tonight,

10:33.484 --> 10:37.387
tell him he won't need
to come sit on us after all.

10:39.157 --> 10:42.092
Oh, you just made
a very dangerous enemy, Kenneth.

10:42.160 --> 10:43.794
Thanks for the heads-up,
Jonathan.

10:43.861 --> 10:46.079
Do you wanna come
to my birthday party?

10:46.164 --> 10:48.131
What are you doing?
That's my job.

10:48.199 --> 10:49.800
Uh, Jonathan
volunteered to clean up

10:49.867 --> 10:51.868
so you could come over again
tonight, right, Jonathan?

10:51.936 --> 10:53.971
But, sir,
it's not just the bathrooms

10:54.038 --> 10:55.439
that need cleaning.

10:55.506 --> 10:57.391
That's why
Jonathan's family is here.

10:59.510 --> 11:02.763
Uh, Liddy goes down at 7:00,
so I'll see you then.

11:04.382 --> 11:05.732
Oh, my.

11:10.855 --> 11:12.089
Liz Lemon.

11:12.156 --> 11:13.724
Any idea when your party
will be over, tray?

11:13.791 --> 11:14.992
The party hasn't started.

11:15.059 --> 11:16.610
That's just the guys
setting up.

11:16.694 --> 11:17.794
Could I borrow a cup of sugar?

11:17.862 --> 11:18.946
I'm trying to get a hummingbird

11:19.030 --> 11:20.330
to drink out of my penis.

11:20.398 --> 11:21.498
I can't do this, Tracy.

11:21.565 --> 11:22.833
This is supposed to be
my vacation.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.284
I wanted to spend it
learning Spanish,

11:24.369 --> 11:25.786
not living next door to you.

11:25.870 --> 11:28.455
I give up. Of course I'm not
allowed to be a human being.

11:28.539 --> 11:29.756
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:29.841 --> 11:31.241
You didn't wanna live
next door to your friend

11:31.309 --> 11:32.909
after all I've done for you?

11:32.961 --> 11:35.679
How many times have I come over
and painted your apartment?

11:35.747 --> 11:37.381
Three! And by the way,
stop doing that.

11:37.432 --> 11:39.383
Or maybe you're saying
we're not friends.

11:39.434 --> 11:40.767
That's fine.

11:40.852 --> 11:44.471
I don't think it'll affect
my behavior next season.

11:46.724 --> 11:49.192
"The sad woman
has been trapped by the idiot."

11:49.260 --> 11:51.528
<i>La mujer triste...</i>

11:51.596 --> 11:52.796
We're friends.

11:52.864 --> 11:53.947
Next year's gonna be fine,

11:54.032 --> 11:55.232
'cause we're good friends.

11:55.283 --> 11:58.168
We're sp...
spending the summer together.

11:58.236 --> 12:01.271
Great! I'll come over
tomorrow morning!

12:09.330 --> 12:10.881
Okay, well,

12:10.948 --> 12:12.549
since you've just been staring
at me like that

12:12.617 --> 12:14.084
for the last 20 minutes,

12:14.152 --> 12:15.385
I'm gonna scoot on out of here.

12:15.453 --> 12:17.321
Don't go, Avery.

12:17.388 --> 12:18.622
Uh, I mean Kenneth.

12:18.690 --> 12:19.856
Sir.

12:19.924 --> 12:21.558
You called me "Avery."

12:21.625 --> 12:23.560
That's your
kidnapped wife's name.

12:23.627 --> 12:25.195
What a coincidence!

12:25.263 --> 12:26.863
I haven't slept in days.

12:26.931 --> 12:28.565
I'm not really feeling
like myself.

12:28.633 --> 12:29.700
You know, in the evening,

12:29.767 --> 12:32.069
Avery and I would
sit together and talk.

12:32.136 --> 12:33.537
It was a nice way to unwind.

12:33.604 --> 12:34.738
Well, I bet you miss...

12:34.805 --> 12:37.507
Put on these earrings.

12:44.082 --> 12:46.717
So...Tell me
about your day.

12:46.784 --> 12:50.053
Well, I got
a soft yes from Jonathan

12:50.121 --> 12:52.055
about my birthday party.

12:52.123 --> 12:54.858
Then I went to
a very uncomfortable dinner.

12:54.926 --> 12:57.761
Do you know what I did today?

12:57.829 --> 12:59.629
Tried to be strong,
sat alone with my thoughts,

12:59.697 --> 13:01.698
then...

13:01.766 --> 13:03.767
I went to a wonderful dinner.

13:03.835 --> 13:07.270
Then the dinner ended?

13:07.338 --> 13:08.939
No.

13:11.943 --> 13:14.544
So, Paul, what do you do?

13:14.612 --> 13:17.064
I am in
the restaurant business,

13:17.148 --> 13:21.218
and I really love...

13:21.285 --> 13:23.387
Golf-playing.

13:23.454 --> 13:26.123
Is that so?
What's your handicap?

13:26.190 --> 13:27.624
Oh, well,
I don't have one myself,

13:27.692 --> 13:30.560
but I do like a girl
with a limp.

13:39.504 --> 13:40.570
Oh, Paul.

13:40.638 --> 13:41.755
So, Mrs. Gremby,

13:41.839 --> 13:44.207
you're also named "Eugene"?

13:44.275 --> 13:46.042
Oh, no, dear.
It's "u" period "Jean."

13:46.110 --> 13:47.711
My first name
is U. Jean

13:47.779 --> 13:50.414
with a "u."

13:54.268 --> 13:56.553
Oh, that's a nice blouse.

13:56.621 --> 13:58.238
It definitely goes
with your eyes,

13:58.322 --> 13:59.489
don't you think, Jenna?

13:59.557 --> 14:01.224
Golf, blouses.

14:01.292 --> 14:03.160
I'm just so impressed
with how normal

14:03.227 --> 14:04.661
this dinner has been.

14:04.729 --> 14:06.329
Very wool!

14:07.498 --> 14:08.782
Greetings, slaves!

14:08.866 --> 14:11.334
Who's ready to get sat on?

14:11.402 --> 14:13.737
Uh, sir,
I don't know who you are,

14:13.805 --> 14:14.838
but you are not wanted here.

14:14.906 --> 14:16.106
Didn't you get my text?

14:16.174 --> 14:17.507
I thought
it was part of the game.

14:17.575 --> 14:18.842
We are good people

14:18.910 --> 14:20.177
who have no interest
in being sat on!

14:20.244 --> 14:22.646
So don't spew your statistics

14:22.713 --> 14:24.431
on the health benefits
of weekly sittings

14:24.515 --> 14:26.650
or its wide acceptance
in eastern cultures.

14:26.717 --> 14:28.268
- Paul.
- We're normal!

14:28.352 --> 14:29.820
And being normal is American,

14:29.887 --> 14:33.824
and it's respectable,
and it makes us...

14:33.891 --> 14:35.258
Happy.

14:35.309 --> 14:37.461
Now get out of here.

14:38.729 --> 14:40.197
Well done, sir.
Bravo.

14:40.264 --> 14:42.699
You handled that pervert
with aplomb.

14:42.767 --> 14:44.701
Very wool.

14:46.070 --> 14:49.105
To tomorrow's photo shoot
and wool.

14:56.147 --> 14:58.415
Shh! Shh, shh, shh.

15:03.947 --> 15:06.115
Unbelievable...
you're still here.

15:06.361 --> 15:07.962
It's still zero, zero, zero.

15:08.030 --> 15:08.996
To zero.

15:09.064 --> 15:10.665
I did it.

15:10.733 --> 15:11.866
I spoke.

15:11.934 --> 15:13.201
This didn't get mailed.

15:13.268 --> 15:14.435
What are you doing here?

15:14.503 --> 15:15.737
Shouldn't you be
out in the Hamptons

15:15.804 --> 15:17.805
not getting invited to stuff?

15:17.873 --> 15:19.073
I came back for the day.

15:19.141 --> 15:21.125
Tracy lives next door to me.

15:21.210 --> 15:22.827
I can't leave, I can't stay.

15:22.911 --> 15:24.445
I'm trapped.

15:24.496 --> 15:25.880
Speaking of trapped,
I got you, Lutz!

15:25.947 --> 15:27.215
Nope, grenade.

15:27.282 --> 15:28.349
Blowing myself up.

15:28.417 --> 15:30.418
Oh, my God.

15:30.486 --> 15:32.487
That's what I have to do.

15:32.554 --> 15:34.989
I <i>can</i> be a normal person.

15:35.057 --> 15:38.309
I have to blow myself up.

15:40.145 --> 15:41.880
No, your honor,
I'm not disputing the fine.

15:41.947 --> 15:43.882
I'm refusing to pay it.

15:43.949 --> 15:45.950
Grenade, respawn.

15:46.018 --> 15:47.785
Miss... I mean, ma'am,
read the fine print.

15:47.853 --> 15:49.621
If you don't pay,
I can sentence you to

15:49.688 --> 15:51.456
up to three weeks
of community service.

15:51.524 --> 15:53.074
How about three months?

15:53.142 --> 15:55.093
This is a sham,
your dis-honor.

15:55.160 --> 15:56.928
Nay, a mockery!

15:56.996 --> 15:59.113
I've put the system on trial.

15:59.198 --> 16:00.765
You can't handle the truth.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.967
I'm out of order?
You're out of order.

16:03.035 --> 16:04.752
Victor Sifuentes!
Hoo-ah!

16:04.837 --> 16:06.454
Gavel, gavel, gavel!

16:06.539 --> 16:07.839
I lost my gavel
over the weekend,

16:07.907 --> 16:09.607
but it doesn't mean
you can talk to me like that.

16:09.675 --> 16:11.593
Talk to who?
I just see an empty robe.

16:11.677 --> 16:14.812
Do you honestly not see me,
or are you being rude?

16:14.880 --> 16:17.265
- I am being rude.
- That's it.

16:17.349 --> 16:19.117
Twelve weeks
of community service.

16:19.184 --> 16:21.519
You'll spend your whole summer
picking up trash.

16:21.587 --> 16:23.988
Gavel, gavel, gavel!

16:24.056 --> 16:25.590
Freedom!

16:25.641 --> 16:27.859
For me.
Probably not you guys.

16:27.927 --> 16:31.129
Mr. Donaghy,
where are my clothes?

16:31.196 --> 16:32.697
Sherry must've put them
in the wash

16:32.765 --> 16:33.932
while you were showering.

16:33.999 --> 16:36.150
Now, give us a twirl.

16:36.235 --> 16:39.037
This is not right, sir.

16:39.104 --> 16:40.772
Now, what do you say you
put on some of Avery's perfume

16:40.839 --> 16:42.140
and we head over
to Strawberry Fields

16:42.207 --> 16:43.975
and whip pennies
at the drum circle?

16:44.043 --> 16:47.445
I don't like to swear, sir,
but, no, thank you.

16:47.513 --> 16:49.847
Now, maybe I haven't had a wife
who was kidnapped,

16:49.915 --> 16:51.950
but I have seen the <i>Brady Bunch</i>

16:52.017 --> 16:53.885
where Tiger runs away.

16:53.953 --> 16:57.622
We've all been through
some bad stuff, Mr. Donaghy.

16:58.673 --> 17:01.309
I had the perfect woman.

17:01.393 --> 17:02.810
Gorgeous.

17:02.895 --> 17:04.662
Brilliant.

17:04.730 --> 17:07.298
Always let me be the hat
in <i>Monopoly</i>.

17:07.348 --> 17:09.400
Why is this happening to me?

17:09.468 --> 17:11.703
God, are you punishing me

17:11.770 --> 17:13.838
because my hair
is better than yours?

17:13.906 --> 17:15.707
All right, sir, enough.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.026
You wanted me
to be Mrs. Donaghy?

17:18.109 --> 17:20.978
Well, I know Mrs. Donaghy,
and she is mean.

17:21.030 --> 17:23.481
She once made Rahm Emanuel
cry in an airport lounge.

17:23.549 --> 17:25.883
So fine.
I will be Mrs. Donaghy.

17:25.951 --> 17:27.719
And I'm gonna say...

17:27.786 --> 17:29.554
Listen to me, Jack.

17:29.622 --> 17:30.855
You don't want people
to pity you?

17:30.923 --> 17:33.891
Well, they should,
because you're pitiful.

17:33.959 --> 17:36.394
You think you're all alone.
"Boo-hoo, why can't my life

17:36.462 --> 17:37.695
be the way it was?"

17:37.763 --> 17:39.864
Well, it can't.

17:39.932 --> 17:41.866
And you're not alone.
You have a daughter

17:41.934 --> 17:43.701
you should be
spending time with

17:43.769 --> 17:45.236
instead of being weird
to Kenneth.

17:45.304 --> 17:49.007
He may be a chinless piece
of human garbage,

17:49.074 --> 17:52.010
but he will never fill the void

17:52.077 --> 17:53.611
that I left behind.

17:53.679 --> 17:55.346
Oh, look, here he comes now.

17:55.397 --> 17:57.115
He's gonna ask me
to go to his birthday party.

17:57.182 --> 17:58.316
"Hi, 'Mrs. Don'gy.'

17:58.367 --> 18:00.318
you wan' come on down
my birfday party?"

18:00.369 --> 18:03.354
No, I can't,
but I know Jack can.

18:03.405 --> 18:06.024
Kenneth, Kenneth, I get it.

18:08.827 --> 18:11.929
Uh, Sherry?
Put Liddy's baby pantsuit on.

18:11.997 --> 18:14.098
I'm taking her
to work with me today.

18:14.166 --> 18:15.400
All right, Mr. Donaghy.

18:15.467 --> 18:18.069
And, uh, thank you.

18:18.137 --> 18:20.371
Avery.

18:24.476 --> 18:26.728
Here's to you, Jenna Maroney.

18:26.812 --> 18:27.912
Even with your back to me,

18:27.980 --> 18:30.881
I can definitely tell it's you.

18:30.933 --> 18:32.233
I'll turn around later.

18:32.317 --> 18:34.485
Perfect.
I'll keep talking.

18:34.553 --> 18:38.322
Mm, wool.

18:38.390 --> 18:41.659
You know, my wife U. Jean
is out of town

18:41.727 --> 18:43.428
visiting her parents' graves.

18:43.495 --> 18:45.079
Maybe we could meet later
for a drink

18:45.164 --> 18:46.731
and you could show me
your front.

18:46.799 --> 18:48.199
We could do that...

18:48.250 --> 18:49.417
Now!

18:49.501 --> 18:50.835
Paul?

18:50.903 --> 18:52.253
And Jenna.

18:52.337 --> 18:53.838
Oh, my God!

18:53.906 --> 18:55.173
I'm finally taking a stand...

18:55.240 --> 18:57.575
After all these days.

18:57.643 --> 18:59.143
You wanted us to be normal.

18:59.211 --> 19:01.295
Well, this is our normal,

19:01.380 --> 19:05.049
and this is what we think
of your morality clause.

19:08.654 --> 19:10.421
Mm, give mommy some beard.

19:10.489 --> 19:11.773
Ugh!

19:11.857 --> 19:13.441
Oh, you got
some crumbs in here.

19:13.525 --> 19:14.625
Oh, eat it.

19:19.198 --> 19:22.116
Good God! Lemon?

19:22.201 --> 19:25.002
Liddy, say
"good God, Lemon."

19:25.070 --> 19:26.537
Goo gah, Lem.

19:26.605 --> 19:29.440
I did it, Jack.
I got my dream vacation!

19:29.491 --> 19:30.708
You're on a chain gang.

19:30.776 --> 19:32.543
I'm outdoors,
I'm wearing comfortable clothes,

19:32.611 --> 19:35.129
I'm gardening,
and I'm learning Spanish!

19:44.306 --> 19:46.424
Uh, Liddy and I
just went to strawberry fields,

19:46.492 --> 19:49.660
where she spat up
on a white lady's dreads.

19:50.929 --> 19:52.029
It's nice to see
that we're back

19:52.097 --> 19:53.898
to our version of normal.

19:56.902 --> 19:58.903
- Jenna?
- Oh, Jenna, no.

19:58.970 --> 20:00.738
There you are!
Bad dog!

20:00.806 --> 20:02.473
You'll go in the crate tonight.

20:02.541 --> 20:05.009
- Grr.
- Ew.

20:05.077 --> 20:06.194
Hey, Jack.
Hey, Liz.

20:06.278 --> 20:08.379
Ow!

20:08.447 --> 20:09.664
Fore!

20:09.748 --> 20:11.148
Hey, guys!

20:11.200 --> 20:14.001
It's me! Tracy!
The black guy from work.

20:14.086 --> 20:15.369
What are you doing?

20:15.454 --> 20:16.454
I hooked a ball onto a truck

20:16.505 --> 20:17.755
on the Long Island Expressway.

20:17.823 --> 20:20.858
And Tracy Jordan
does not take Mulligans.

20:20.926 --> 20:23.060
Good thing you had
to move out of that house.

20:23.128 --> 20:25.930
Some idiot rammed his boat
that I was driving into it.

20:31.136 --> 20:33.304
You see all the good
that is in them,

20:33.355 --> 20:35.172
how much capacity for love?

20:35.224 --> 20:37.909
Yes, I know.

20:37.976 --> 20:39.677
I just need more time
with them.

20:39.745 --> 20:42.179
Give me more time, Jacob,

20:42.231 --> 20:43.731
I beg of you!

20:50.009 --> 20:51.527
Go, I see you...
I'm killing myself.

20:51.878 --> 20:52.879
Respawn.

20:55.080 --> 20:56.114
Respawn.

20:56.966 --> 20:58.168
Oh...
Dammit!

21:02.236 --> 21:05.636
Hola, everyone!
Are you ready for Season 6?

21:08.704 --> 21:07.471
And we moved the files from your
old computer over for free.

21:09.039 --> 21:10.039
Oh, my God.

21:10.342 --> 21:11.108
Wait...

21:11.110 --> 21:12.977
How long have we've been here?

21:12.978 --> 21:22.977
