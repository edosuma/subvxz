WEBVTT

00:01.910 --> 00:03.318
NARRATOR:
Throughout the ancient world,

00:03.412 --> 00:05.412
there are tales
of fire-breathing beasts

00:05.506 --> 00:07.748
descending from the sky.

00:07.842 --> 00:09.341
No matter where we go,

00:09.493 --> 00:11.902
we find legends of these beings.

00:11.995 --> 00:15.422
Throughout Asia,
ancient cultures reported

00:15.574 --> 00:17.924
dragons descending from the sky.

00:18.077 --> 00:21.261
We have dragon stories in India,

00:21.413 --> 00:25.098
in Indonesia, in ancient Greece.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.918
NARRATOR: These winged
creatures inspired both fear

00:27.936 --> 00:29.586
and veneration.

00:29.605 --> 00:30.678
KATHLEEN McGOWAN:
The dragon represents

00:30.698 --> 00:33.365
something incredibly powerful

00:33.517 --> 00:34.867
but also incredibly noble.

00:35.094 --> 00:36.426
The dragons are here

00:36.520 --> 00:40.021
to bring something
to their people.

00:40.115 --> 00:43.375
NARRATOR: But could accounts
of dragons be based on real events?

00:45.437 --> 00:48.605
And might the truth
behind this mythical monster

00:48.624 --> 00:52.442
be more incredible
than anyone has imagined?

00:52.536 --> 00:54.702
The dragon that came
from the sky,

00:54.722 --> 00:57.872
the sons of Heaven that
came from those dragons...

00:59.060 --> 01:02.478
are integral to the
foundation of civilization.

01:06.809 --> 01:08.550
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:08.569 --> 01:11.461
in the universe.

01:11.555 --> 01:14.323
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:15.968 --> 01:18.135
It demands
we question everything

01:18.153 --> 01:20.470
we have ever been taught.

01:20.564 --> 01:24.399
The evidence is all around us.

01:24.493 --> 01:28.145
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:28.163 --> 01:30.831
We are not alone.

01:30.983 --> 01:34.176
We have never been alone.

01:42.919 --> 01:45.920
NARRATOR:
Shaanxi Province, China.

01:45.940 --> 01:49.608
April 6, 2019.

01:51.186 --> 01:53.003
In the ceremonial courtyard

01:53.096 --> 01:55.689
of the Mausoleum
of the Yellow Emperor,

01:55.783 --> 02:00.193
10,000 people gather to watch
a traditional Dragon Dance.

02:01.347 --> 02:04.030
The dragon dance is
an ancient ceremony

02:04.125 --> 02:06.441
which for thousands of years
has been a representation

02:06.460 --> 02:08.185
of the dragons
coming from the sky

02:08.203 --> 02:10.687
and returning to the sky.

02:10.706 --> 02:12.614
PAUL STONEHILL: This is part
of the Chinese culture,

02:12.708 --> 02:15.208
of the Chinese civilization,

02:15.302 --> 02:20.046
so it's very important for
the Chinese to have this dance.

02:20.141 --> 02:23.533
The Chinese people from the very
little... from toddlers on

02:23.552 --> 02:26.553
know about the dragons.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.222
The dragons are ever present.

02:29.316 --> 02:31.375
Ancient China was a land

02:31.393 --> 02:34.636
where humans lived in tandem
with the divine beings,

02:34.655 --> 02:36.046
with the gods.

02:36.064 --> 02:39.658
And the gods rode upon dragons.

02:39.885 --> 02:42.477
And so for this reason
the dragon became revered

02:42.496 --> 02:44.830
as a sacred symbol
throughout China.

02:45.982 --> 02:47.391
NARRATOR:
Here in Shaanxi,

02:47.484 --> 02:50.727
in what is known
as the Qingming Festival,

02:50.820 --> 02:52.838
the ceremony celebrates
the deity

02:52.989 --> 02:55.799
considered to be the father
of all Chinese people.

02:57.069 --> 02:58.084
The Yellow Emperor,

02:58.179 --> 03:00.179
also known as Huangdi,

03:00.406 --> 03:01.755
is a legendary ruler

03:01.849 --> 03:03.907
who founded Chinese civilization

03:03.926 --> 03:06.643
nearly 5,000 years ago.

03:08.355 --> 03:11.581
DOMINIC STEAVU: the Yellow
Emperor Huangdi is this, uh,

03:11.600 --> 03:14.676
semi-mythical figure
in Chinese history.

03:14.770 --> 03:18.755
He's an originator of Chinese
civilization and culture.

03:18.848 --> 03:21.775
And he is credited
with numerous inventions

03:21.869 --> 03:25.019
that-that came to define
Chinese civilization--

03:25.113 --> 03:27.764
Anything from
domesticating animals

03:27.783 --> 03:30.358
to the calendar

03:30.377 --> 03:33.861
and various
astronomical sciences.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.607
The Yellow Emperor also
crafted a magical caldron,

03:37.626 --> 03:39.551
and one version of the story

03:39.703 --> 03:43.296
has a dragon emerging
from the caldron

03:43.449 --> 03:46.892
and then the Yellow Emperor
jumps on the dragon's back,

03:47.119 --> 03:50.562
and the dragon ascends
up to Heaven.

03:50.714 --> 03:52.456
JUDY CHUNGWA HO:
The Chinese would say

03:52.474 --> 03:55.550
we're the descendants
of the Yellow Emperor.

03:55.644 --> 03:58.795
That's one way of putting
how Chinese believe him to be,

03:58.888 --> 04:03.149
the v-very founder
of Chinese civilization.

04:03.244 --> 04:05.986
In fact, just about everything

04:06.080 --> 04:09.897
that you would think as the
basic elements of civilization

04:09.917 --> 04:13.827
is somehow associated
with the Yellow Emperor.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.754
(speaking Chinese)

04:15.981 --> 04:17.923
TRANSLATOR: We Chinese people
consider ourselves

04:18.074 --> 04:19.883
the descendants of the dragon.

04:21.911 --> 04:23.987
So there should be
a certain connection

04:24.006 --> 04:26.506
between the identities
of the Chinese people

04:26.600 --> 04:29.250
both as the descendants
of the Yellow Emperor

04:29.344 --> 04:31.603
and as the descendants
of the dragon.

04:34.924 --> 04:36.758
NARRATOR: At the end
of the Qingming Festival,

04:36.852 --> 04:39.761
the dragon is released
into the sky,

04:39.780 --> 04:43.023
symbolizing Huangdi's
departure from Earth

04:43.117 --> 04:44.599
to the heavenly realm.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.601
The Yellow Emperor is believed

04:46.695 --> 04:49.346
to have flown up to the sky,

04:49.439 --> 04:52.699
um, and dwell, um,
in the Pole Star

04:52.793 --> 04:55.627
at the very center of the sky.

04:55.854 --> 04:59.873
And there he actually
would live forever.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.949
The idea of a dragon,

05:01.969 --> 05:05.879
a metaphysical being
who looked very real,

05:06.031 --> 05:08.122
had to come from somewhere.

05:08.216 --> 05:10.124
They could not just imagine

05:10.144 --> 05:13.219
a complicated being
like Chinese dragons.

05:13.372 --> 05:15.480
They had to see objects

05:15.707 --> 05:17.891
that were flying
at incredible speeds

05:18.043 --> 05:20.736
and the superior beings
riding on them.

05:22.639 --> 05:25.473
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS: Now,
from the ancient astronaut perspective,

05:25.492 --> 05:28.142
the dragon was never a dragon.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.829
It was a flying craft.

05:32.333 --> 05:34.148
It is only natural

05:34.168 --> 05:37.577
that our ancestors would
describe these things

05:37.729 --> 05:40.564
as living creatures
with fire and smoke.

05:40.582 --> 05:43.917
They had never seen
anything like it before.

05:44.069 --> 05:46.160
- (gong sounds)
- One has to wonder

05:46.254 --> 05:48.996
if Huangdi himself was
misinterpreted

05:49.091 --> 05:51.850
and that he was
an extraterrestrial

05:52.077 --> 05:54.686
and he arrived in
an extraterrestrial craft.

05:56.932 --> 05:58.915
SUN SHILI:
In China, in UFO research,

05:59.008 --> 06:01.276
a dragon is the symbol
of aircraft.

06:03.088 --> 06:05.179
There is a view
that the Yellow Emperor

06:05.199 --> 06:07.032
arrived in the wonderful
land of China

06:07.259 --> 06:09.868
through an aircraft,
and he flew back afterwards.

06:12.689 --> 06:15.690
NARRATOR: Could the story
of Huangdi traveling on a dragon

06:15.784 --> 06:17.784
be an account
of an extraterrestrial

06:17.936 --> 06:19.544
traveling in a spaceship,

06:19.696 --> 06:22.714
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest?

06:22.941 --> 06:24.774
In the modern world,

06:24.868 --> 06:27.110
tales of dragons
are widely considered

06:27.129 --> 06:29.946
to be strictly a product
of the imagination.

06:29.965 --> 06:33.725
But some researchers believe
physical evidence exists

06:33.877 --> 06:35.376
that suggests

06:35.396 --> 06:38.980
the ancient stories
of dragons could be true.

06:41.402 --> 06:45.904
The Baian-Kara-Ula mountains,
Qinghai Province, China.

06:47.633 --> 06:49.466
According to an article
published in 1962

06:49.484 --> 06:53.078
in the German magazine
<i>Das Vegetarisches Universum,</i>

06:53.305 --> 06:57.807
Beijing University
archaeologist Dr. Tsum Um Nui

06:57.901 --> 07:01.569
was leading an expedition
here in 1936

07:01.588 --> 07:03.313
when he and his team came upon

07:03.406 --> 07:06.591
neat rows of graves
inside a cave.

07:06.818 --> 07:09.836
The archaeologists reported
that the graves

07:09.930 --> 07:13.823
contained the corpses of small
creatures resembling humans

07:13.842 --> 07:17.936
but with spindly arms
and legs and huge skulls.

07:18.087 --> 07:22.590
And buried with them were
hundreds of strange stone disks.

07:22.684 --> 07:25.185
There's a fascinating
story in China

07:25.279 --> 07:27.779
where allegedly

07:27.931 --> 07:31.616
a cave was found
with hundreds of disks

07:31.843 --> 07:35.028
and these disks were
about this wide

07:35.122 --> 07:39.015
and it seemed that they had
some type of a groove in them

07:39.108 --> 07:42.610
reminding of modern-day
vinyl records.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.188
And what's interesting

07:45.207 --> 07:49.450
is that allegedly

07:49.470 --> 07:53.713
some of these grooves contained
really tiny types of writing,

07:53.865 --> 07:55.623
hieroglyphics or something.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.793
WILLIAM HENRY: And when
archeologists finally deciphered

07:58.887 --> 08:00.461
or translated this writing,

08:00.481 --> 08:03.540
it told this incredible story

08:03.558 --> 08:06.376
of extraterrestrial beings
called the Dropas

08:06.469 --> 08:09.062
and how they had come
from the stars,

08:09.156 --> 08:11.231
crash-landed on Earth

08:11.383 --> 08:13.399
and were unable
to rebuild a spacecraft

08:13.552 --> 08:15.118
in order to return
to their home.

08:16.404 --> 08:17.996
NARRATOR:
Unfortunately,

08:18.147 --> 08:20.999
after the initial research
in the early 1960s,

08:21.226 --> 08:24.503
the disks, known today
as the Dropa stones,

08:24.730 --> 08:25.837
vanished.

08:25.989 --> 08:29.415
But mysteriously, in 1974,

08:29.568 --> 08:31.158
photographs surfaced

08:31.178 --> 08:34.012
of what were alleged
to be two Dropa Stones

08:34.163 --> 08:39.592
on display at the Banpo Museum
in Xian City, China.

08:39.686 --> 08:43.855
In 1994, a colleague
of mine, Hartwig Hausdorf

08:44.082 --> 08:48.026
and his colleague
Peter Krassa went to China

08:48.253 --> 08:51.029
to ask the whereabouts
of these stone disks.

08:52.257 --> 08:55.425
During the '60s and '70s,

08:55.443 --> 08:58.686
there was a big cultural
revolution in China,

08:58.705 --> 09:03.024
where lots of cultural
relics were, uh, destroyed.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.118
And that's possibly the reason

09:05.270 --> 09:09.047
that two of the more
than 700 stone disks

09:09.198 --> 09:11.550
could have found
their way down to Xian

09:11.701 --> 09:13.385
and to this little museum.

09:14.555 --> 09:16.613
In spring of 1994,

09:16.706 --> 09:20.725
my way led me also into
this little Banpo Museum,

09:20.952 --> 09:22.952
where I got to speak

09:23.046 --> 09:26.306
with the present curator
of the museum.

09:26.458 --> 09:27.899
I showed him the photographs

09:28.126 --> 09:31.903
that were taken
20 years ago in his museum,

09:32.130 --> 09:37.483
and he told me the former
manageress of the museum,

09:37.578 --> 09:40.820
along with the two stone
disks that were on display,

09:40.972 --> 09:44.324
they have disappeared
without any trace,

09:44.418 --> 09:46.901
and up to now, no one knows

09:46.920 --> 09:50.880
where this lady and the two
stone disks have gone.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.333
We can speculate

09:53.485 --> 09:55.409
that most of the stone disks

09:55.503 --> 09:57.745
are still inside those caves

09:57.839 --> 10:00.223
in Baian-Kara-Ula mountains.

10:01.676 --> 10:04.251
NARRATOR: Could there
be additional Dropa stones

10:04.271 --> 10:07.772
still hidden somewhere
in the Baian-Kara-Ula mountains?

10:07.999 --> 10:10.500
For ancient astronaut theorists,

10:10.593 --> 10:13.002
another intriguing
aspect of the story

10:13.096 --> 10:14.929
is that the Qinghai Province,

10:15.023 --> 10:16.931
which is home
to this mountain range

10:17.025 --> 10:20.193
has a connection to dragons.

10:20.345 --> 10:22.269
What's interesting
about the Dropa stones

10:22.364 --> 10:25.865
is that the region they were
discovered in is very close

10:25.959 --> 10:29.869
to the Qinghai Lake which has
its patron as a dragon god.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.355
You have the fascinating story

10:32.448 --> 10:34.540
of the Dragon King
of the West Sea,

10:34.635 --> 10:36.635
the Qinghai Lake.

10:36.862 --> 10:40.121
And Qinghai is also
in the same area

10:40.140 --> 10:43.308
where the Dropa stones
allegedly came from.

10:43.535 --> 10:45.960
Now, one of the fascinating
connections here

10:45.979 --> 10:49.648
is that the Dragon Kings were
also said to be cloud breathers.

10:50.876 --> 10:52.984
And one of the things
that we see

10:53.211 --> 10:56.821
in the actual translation
from the Dropa stones

10:56.973 --> 10:58.806
is that the Dropa people
came forth

10:58.825 --> 11:01.642
in their clouds from the sky.

11:01.662 --> 11:04.554
So this idea of
cloud breathers as dragons

11:04.647 --> 11:07.724
and the Dropa coming
from these clouds

11:07.817 --> 11:09.668
seems to be
potentially connected.

11:09.819 --> 11:13.505
Maybe the dragons and the Dropa
are one and the same.

11:14.749 --> 11:17.158
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the dragon,

11:17.177 --> 11:20.828
which remains sacred and iconic
in China to this day,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.664
commemorates
an extraterrestrial visitation

11:23.758 --> 11:26.576
that occurred
thousands of years ago

11:26.669 --> 11:29.837
and was allegedly recorded
on the Dropa stones?

11:29.856 --> 11:33.099
Perhaps further clues
can be found

11:33.251 --> 11:37.086
by examining other ancient
traditions all over the world

11:37.105 --> 11:39.030
of dragon gods.

11:46.189 --> 11:47.288
NARRATOR:
Kyoto, Japan.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.875
An imposing statue of a dragon

11:51.102 --> 11:52.860
guards the west gate
of the Buddhist temple

11:52.954 --> 11:54.379
known as Kiyomizu-dera.

11:55.623 --> 11:58.958
It is just one of the many
dragons that adorn the shrine,

11:59.110 --> 12:01.052
and according to temple legends,

12:01.279 --> 12:04.113
every night a dragon
descends from the sky

12:04.207 --> 12:06.725
to drink at the temple's
waterfall.

12:06.876 --> 12:10.970
In Japan, dragons,
sometimes known as naga,

12:11.122 --> 12:13.565
are not only revered as deities.

12:13.716 --> 12:15.124
They are also considered

12:15.218 --> 12:17.736
to be the founders
of Japan's royal family.

12:20.632 --> 12:23.742
It was said in ancient Japan
that the dragon god

12:23.893 --> 12:26.486
lived at the bottom
of the ocean.

12:26.638 --> 12:27.895
His daughter had a daughter,

12:27.989 --> 12:33.810
and her child was Jimmu,
the first Emperor of Japan.

12:33.903 --> 12:35.920
To be descended from a dragon

12:36.147 --> 12:40.500
is to be from the divine
dimension of nature,

12:40.594 --> 12:43.261
but also from the stars.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.598
NARRATOR:
According to legend,

12:46.825 --> 12:50.176
Jimmu, the great-grandson
of the dragon god,

12:50.328 --> 12:54.347
received three divine items
called the Imperial Regalia.

12:54.499 --> 12:56.666
WILLIAM HENRY:
The Imperial Regalia of Japan

12:56.759 --> 12:58.501
was sent
from the heavenly realms.

12:59.613 --> 13:03.264
This was composed of a jewel,
a sword and a mirror

13:03.283 --> 13:06.359
that was utilized by all
the Japanese emperors,

13:06.511 --> 13:08.953
and they're still believed
to exist to this day.

13:10.773 --> 13:11.956
They're considered
to be artifacts

13:12.108 --> 13:14.183
of such incredible power

13:14.202 --> 13:16.185
that ordinary people
are not allowed

13:16.279 --> 13:17.462
to come into contact with them.

13:18.781 --> 13:21.800
TSOUKALOS:
With this celestial mirror,

13:21.951 --> 13:24.969
it is said that he
was able to see

13:25.121 --> 13:28.364
anything that goes on
on planet Earth

13:28.457 --> 13:31.868
without having to go anywhere.

13:31.886 --> 13:33.978
What are we talking about here?

13:35.482 --> 13:39.300
Imagine that you show
your laptop or your cell phone

13:39.394 --> 13:41.894
to your great-great-grandfather

13:42.047 --> 13:43.546
and all of a sudden

13:43.565 --> 13:46.658
you are showing him
a magical mirror

13:46.885 --> 13:50.161
because you can see
anything on a laptop.

13:50.388 --> 13:54.648
I think that the celestial
regalia of Jimmu

13:54.668 --> 13:57.894
are extraterrestrial artifacts

13:57.987 --> 14:00.413
that were collected at the time

14:00.507 --> 14:04.734
when the celestial teachers
referred to as dragons

14:04.752 --> 14:07.328
were here teaching mankind,

14:07.347 --> 14:09.848
in this case
in the area of Japan.

14:11.076 --> 14:14.577
(speaking Japanese)

14:14.596 --> 14:16.929
TRANSLATOR: The ancestors
of the Japanese emperor

14:17.082 --> 14:18.523
were gods...

14:20.509 --> 14:23.152
specifically gods in the sky.

14:25.256 --> 14:27.106
They landed on the Earth,

14:27.258 --> 14:30.034
and are linked to the current
Japanese imperial family.

14:33.206 --> 14:37.208
Which means that their family
is related to extraterrestrials.

14:41.456 --> 14:43.456
NARRATOR: While the
dragon is a prominent figure

14:43.608 --> 14:45.291
in East Asian cultures,

14:45.385 --> 14:48.869
many ancient peoples
who archaeologists believe

14:48.963 --> 14:50.963
had no history of contact

14:51.057 --> 14:55.635
also revered this supposedly
mythical flying beast.

14:56.804 --> 15:01.641
Dragons are found throughout
Africa and in ancient Egypt.

15:01.793 --> 15:04.293
They were featured
in the earliest traditions

15:04.312 --> 15:07.797
of Persia, Greece and Rome.

15:07.815 --> 15:09.908
And North American folklore

15:10.059 --> 15:12.410
often spoke
of dragon-like creatures.

15:13.655 --> 15:16.247
The dragon is worldwide

15:16.474 --> 15:18.157
because, again,
in Central America

15:18.251 --> 15:20.326
in Villahermosa,

15:20.478 --> 15:24.088
there's a stone called
the dragon monolith.

15:24.315 --> 15:27.316
You see a man sitting
inside the dragon.

15:27.410 --> 15:29.260
You see the form of the dragon

15:29.412 --> 15:33.080
with this open mouth
like a snake,

15:33.099 --> 15:35.174
and you see the man
is sitting inside.

15:35.326 --> 15:37.268
He has a helmet on.

15:37.495 --> 15:40.271
He uses his hands
to manipulate control.

15:41.516 --> 15:43.683
So the story of the dragon

15:43.835 --> 15:47.445
has come around the world
from China to Central America.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.949
HUGH NEWMAN:
So dragons are found

15:51.176 --> 15:54.010
all over the world
in ancient traditions,

15:54.028 --> 15:57.530
and there's always an element
of extreme power.

15:57.682 --> 15:59.106
They could destroy,

15:59.125 --> 16:00.683
but they could also
become allies.

16:01.795 --> 16:06.038
And they were great teachers,
of very high wisdom,

16:06.132 --> 16:09.375
and have extreme intelligence
as well in some cases.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.137
And yet this became a symbol
of different cultures

16:13.364 --> 16:15.473
and different leaders
around the world,

16:15.624 --> 16:19.293
but was this because
they'd witnessed something

16:19.312 --> 16:24.298
emerging from clouds,
from a fiery kind of sky

16:24.392 --> 16:25.984
and actually this is where

16:26.211 --> 16:29.061
the whole dragon mythos
really came from?

16:29.214 --> 16:30.880
Who were the original dragons?

16:30.898 --> 16:34.283
And why are they always
depicted as flying?

16:36.221 --> 16:38.145
NARRATOR:
For researchers of mythology,

16:38.164 --> 16:40.164
an equally intriguing question

16:40.391 --> 16:43.226
is why so many separate
cultures ended up

16:43.244 --> 16:46.579
calling these flying entities
by the same name.

16:46.673 --> 16:50.491
Many languages use exactly
the same word for dragon,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.918
or something very similar,
at least.

16:53.071 --> 16:55.847
You have got in the Middle East,

16:55.998 --> 16:58.499
the Philistine god

16:58.593 --> 17:01.427
who looks like a dragon

17:01.521 --> 17:04.430
was called Dagon.

17:04.582 --> 17:07.683
In England you've got Dragon.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.196
In parts of Finland
you've got Dragon.

17:13.941 --> 17:18.594
And in Eastern Europe
you've got Dracul.

17:19.764 --> 17:23.041
And then a bit further south,
you've got Dracu.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.527
NARRATOR:
In Basque,

17:26.546 --> 17:28.788
which is unconnected
to any other language,

17:28.940 --> 17:30.531
the word is Dragoi.

17:30.550 --> 17:32.625
In India, it's Dregan.

17:32.777 --> 17:34.701
In Swahili, Dragoni.

17:34.721 --> 17:37.613
And in ancient Greek, Drakon.

17:37.632 --> 17:39.891
GRAHAM PHILLIPS:
They all have similar names.

17:41.119 --> 17:44.136
How can this be?
What's behind all this?

17:44.289 --> 17:46.122
These people were not
in touch with each other.

17:46.215 --> 17:48.399
So, how does this come about?

17:49.718 --> 17:52.311
It's very curious that,
no matter where we go,

17:52.405 --> 17:55.481
we find legends of dragons
with the exact same word

17:55.575 --> 17:58.576
used to describe this
creature or these beings.

17:58.727 --> 18:02.246
It must be that there was
a common source.

18:02.473 --> 18:04.323
And it makes you wonder
if it's possible

18:04.417 --> 18:07.493
that these beings originally
introduced themselves

18:07.645 --> 18:11.589
with this name that is
something like "dragon."

18:13.668 --> 18:15.151
NARRATOR:
What can account

18:15.244 --> 18:17.077
for this supposedly
mythical creature

18:17.097 --> 18:19.413
appearing in dozens
of distinct traditions

18:19.432 --> 18:22.082
throughout the ancient world?

18:22.102 --> 18:25.328
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

18:25.421 --> 18:27.496
the ubiquity of dragon legends

18:27.515 --> 18:29.849
lends further support
to the notion

18:30.001 --> 18:32.777
that our ancestors
encountered alien vehicles

18:32.928 --> 18:34.946
descending from the sky.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.841
The reason why countless
ancient cultures

18:38.860 --> 18:41.101
have references to dragons

18:41.121 --> 18:44.847
is because many
of these ancient cultures

18:44.940 --> 18:47.774
were visited by the same beings

18:47.794 --> 18:49.919
flying the same craft.

18:51.706 --> 18:55.967
They're seeing the same thing
in all these different places,

18:56.118 --> 18:59.211
and what they're seeing
is of airships

18:59.364 --> 19:03.641
with fire and thunder
and smoke and huge wings,

19:03.792 --> 19:07.294
and so they're describing
them in-in similar ways

19:07.313 --> 19:08.888
in different parts of the world.

19:09.040 --> 19:10.706
NARRATOR:
Could the ubiquity

19:10.725 --> 19:12.892
of dragon worship
throughout the world,

19:13.044 --> 19:15.895
along with the curious
linguistic connection,

19:15.989 --> 19:18.990
provide further evidence
that our ancestors witnessed

19:19.217 --> 19:22.660
something very real
coming down from the sky?

19:22.811 --> 19:24.996
Perhaps further clues
can be found

19:25.147 --> 19:29.333
by examining ancient stone
sculptures from North America

19:29.560 --> 19:32.745
that depict a legendary
flying serpent god

19:32.897 --> 19:34.505
in a humanoid form.

19:40.496 --> 19:43.181
NARRATOR:
Teotihuacan, Mexico.

19:43.332 --> 19:46.759
Dating back to at least
the first century AD,

19:46.853 --> 19:49.336
this ancient complex was once

19:49.355 --> 19:51.931
the largest city in Mesoamerica

19:52.025 --> 19:55.526
with a population of 125,000.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.755
One of the most sacred
temples at the site

19:59.848 --> 20:02.274
is the Temple of
the Feathered Serpent,

20:02.368 --> 20:04.593
an enormous step pyramid

20:04.687 --> 20:07.288
dedicated to the god
Quetzalcoatl.

20:08.933 --> 20:11.191
Quetzalcoatl,
the feathered serpent,

20:11.285 --> 20:13.118
goes all the way
back to Olmec times,

20:13.213 --> 20:15.104
to the BCE period.

20:15.122 --> 20:18.290
But the first place that we
really see Quetzalcoatl

20:18.384 --> 20:20.367
is in Teotihuacan,

20:20.386 --> 20:24.630
the city just north
of modern Mexico City.

20:24.724 --> 20:29.227
They build a actual pyramid,
a temple of Quetzalcoatl,

20:29.454 --> 20:32.471
right around 250 AD.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.474
So, it's probably Teotihuacan

20:35.568 --> 20:38.402
who really put forward

20:38.554 --> 20:42.723
the idea and the identity
of Quetzalcoatl as a deity

20:42.817 --> 20:44.891
for the rest of Mesoamerica.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.303
Quetzalcoatl was a creator god.

20:47.321 --> 20:49.638
He was associated
with the planet Venus.

20:49.732 --> 20:52.475
He brought the rain.
He brought water.

20:52.493 --> 20:55.311
He brought civilization.
He brought the arts.

20:55.329 --> 20:59.406
This was the creator divinity
for the Aztec culture.

20:59.500 --> 21:02.985
It was a flying serpent.
It was a dragon.

21:03.004 --> 21:08.081
Quetzalcoatl brought peace,
harmony and high wisdom

21:08.175 --> 21:10.676
and very high level
of intelligence

21:10.828 --> 21:13.271
and teaching
to this particular land.

21:13.498 --> 21:16.332
He was often depicted
as a human being as well,

21:16.425 --> 21:19.259
that he arrived
on a raft of serpents

21:19.353 --> 21:21.837
and settled on these lands.

21:21.930 --> 21:24.673
ED BARNHART:
Quetzalcoatl also shows up

21:24.767 --> 21:29.269
in the post-classic Maya city
of Chichen Itza.

21:29.363 --> 21:31.772
But they give him a Mayan name.

21:31.791 --> 21:35.442
They call him Kukulkan,
which is basically

21:35.536 --> 21:38.854
"The holy feathered serpent"
in Maya.

21:38.873 --> 21:41.948
NARRATOR: The ancient
Mayan city of Chichen Itza

21:41.968 --> 21:46.211
lies roughly 900 miles
east of Teotihuacan,

21:46.306 --> 21:50.641
and at its center stands
another massive step pyramid,

21:50.793 --> 21:52.701
this one dedicated

21:52.720 --> 21:56.722
to the Mayan version of
the flying serpent Kukulkan.

21:56.816 --> 22:00.133
In Chichen Itza, there we have
the pyramid of Kukulkan,

22:00.227 --> 22:03.212
and every year
on the 23rd of March,

22:03.305 --> 22:07.066
you see, when the sun
is going up,

22:07.160 --> 22:09.568
some lights and shadows,

22:09.720 --> 22:12.404
lights and shadows
like triangles

22:12.557 --> 22:15.315
climbing down the stairway,

22:15.335 --> 22:19.319
exactly the stairway
where his head is on.

22:19.339 --> 22:22.840
And on the 21st of September
you see the opposite.

22:23.067 --> 22:24.917
Kukulkan disappears,

22:25.011 --> 22:28.662
and it's only made by light
and shadow of the natural sun.

22:28.756 --> 22:31.073
So still today
the message is clear--

22:31.092 --> 22:33.909
God Kukulkan has descended
to the humans.

22:34.002 --> 22:36.687
He teached them
for a certain period,

22:36.839 --> 22:39.748
and then he disappeared again.

22:39.842 --> 22:43.419
So right there we have
living mythology

22:43.437 --> 22:47.698
in a structure
that shows this deity

22:47.850 --> 22:50.868
descending from the sky
in stone.

22:52.113 --> 22:54.521
You wonder if perhaps
a craft landed here

22:54.615 --> 22:56.615
and this light-shadow effect

22:56.709 --> 23:00.269
of a serpent making its way
descending down the staircase,

23:00.287 --> 23:02.028
and then emerging
through a serpent head

23:02.048 --> 23:05.532
is a recollection
of that original event.

23:05.626 --> 23:06.867
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

23:06.961 --> 23:08.552
that the Pyramid of Kukulkan

23:08.779 --> 23:11.705
was not built to honor
a mythical dragon god

23:11.724 --> 23:13.616
but to commemorate the arrival

23:13.709 --> 23:16.452
of an extraterrestrial
spacecraft?

23:16.545 --> 23:19.304
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

23:19.399 --> 23:23.125
and suggest this isn't the only
dragon-themed structure

23:23.144 --> 23:25.986
that marks a location
of alien contact.

23:32.303 --> 23:34.637
The landscape of
this small Greek island

23:34.655 --> 23:38.824
is spotted with 25 mysterious
megalithic structures

23:38.918 --> 23:41.085
called dragon houses.

23:41.236 --> 23:44.496
TSOUKALOS: The main
dragon house is at the very top

23:44.590 --> 23:48.000
of one of the tallest
mountains on the island

23:48.094 --> 23:50.577
called Mount Ochi.

23:50.671 --> 23:55.491
Mount Ochi comes
from the word "Ochevare"

23:55.584 --> 23:59.437
which means
to descend and to drive.

23:59.664 --> 24:04.424
And so this is interesting
because, according to legend,

24:04.444 --> 24:06.593
the reason why the dragon house

24:06.687 --> 24:09.947
exists at the top of Mount Ochi

24:10.098 --> 24:15.694
is because Zeus allegedly
descended from the heavens

24:15.788 --> 24:17.621
on top of that mountain.

24:19.366 --> 24:21.459
NARRATOR:
According to local legend,

24:21.610 --> 24:24.703
these stone structures
were built by a giant dragon

24:24.855 --> 24:27.706
to venerate the god Zeus.

24:27.800 --> 24:31.451
In ancient Greece, the word
"dragon" was not only used

24:31.545 --> 24:33.453
to describe a flying monster

24:33.547 --> 24:35.455
but also gods and other figures

24:35.475 --> 24:37.199
that had human-like form

24:37.292 --> 24:40.961
but possessed superhuman powers.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.871
Now, when you put
all this together,

24:42.890 --> 24:44.873
this sounds like
the dragon house

24:44.967 --> 24:46.650
is a meeting place
of Heaven and Earth.

24:46.877 --> 24:50.303
In UFO vernacular,
that would be a landing spot.

24:50.397 --> 24:52.231
TSOUKALOS:
In my opinion,

24:52.383 --> 24:56.476
the dragon was the craft
out of which, then,

24:56.496 --> 25:00.723
the creator people,
or the teachers, emerged.

25:00.741 --> 25:03.000
Our ancestors, basically,

25:03.227 --> 25:07.421
they saw a crew coming
out of an airplane.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.343
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

25:12.494 --> 25:15.679
some of the structures
themselves serve as evidence

25:15.831 --> 25:18.933
that this was a place
of extraterrestrial contact.

25:20.077 --> 25:23.003
The dragon house
on top of Mt. Ochi

25:23.022 --> 25:26.673
contains megalithic blocks
weighing up to ten tons

25:26.692 --> 25:30.110
and sits at an elevation
of almost 5,000 feet.

25:32.014 --> 25:33.756
TSOUKALOS:
Archaeologists have a hard time

25:33.849 --> 25:37.609
explaining why
it was even built there

25:37.703 --> 25:39.686
because we are talking

25:39.780 --> 25:42.931
of this gigantic
megalithic structure

25:43.025 --> 25:46.451
with a ceiling
that contains blocks

25:46.546 --> 25:48.771
that are up to ten feet long,

25:48.789 --> 25:51.456
two feet thick,

25:51.551 --> 25:54.385
at an altitude of 5,000 feet.

25:54.536 --> 25:56.387
How was that done?

25:56.538 --> 26:00.373
In my opinion, this was
an extraterrestrial visitation

26:00.393 --> 26:03.635
where Zeus may have
descended in his craft

26:03.729 --> 26:05.813
and built a day camp.

26:07.792 --> 26:09.049
NARRATOR:
Could the stone structures

26:09.143 --> 26:11.402
found in Greece and Mesoamerica

26:11.553 --> 26:12.961
mark the locations

26:13.055 --> 26:16.056
where otherworldly beings
landed on Earth

26:16.150 --> 26:19.201
and ultimately
returned to the stars?

26:20.896 --> 26:23.080
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

26:23.307 --> 26:24.973
and suggest

26:24.992 --> 26:28.234
these alien visitors
may still be here today,

26:28.254 --> 26:30.646
pointing to legends of dragons

26:30.739 --> 26:32.548
that come not from the sky...

26:33.742 --> 26:35.759
but from under the sea.

26:41.583 --> 26:44.843
NARRATOR:
Nineveh, 1849.

26:44.995 --> 26:48.013
British archaeologist
Austen Henry Layard

26:48.107 --> 26:52.184
and his team uncover a cache
of ancient clay tablets

26:52.336 --> 26:55.946
dating back to at least
the seventh century BC.

26:57.174 --> 26:58.765
The pieces contain some

26:58.784 --> 27:01.176
of the earliest
writings of humankind,

27:01.269 --> 27:03.770
including the Epic of Gilgamesh

27:03.864 --> 27:06.031
and the Enuma Elis,

27:06.125 --> 27:10.127
the Sumerian creation story
centered around a sea dragon.

27:11.446 --> 27:14.465
Ancient Sumeria is
generally considered

27:14.616 --> 27:16.800
the earliest civilization
on Earth,

27:17.027 --> 27:20.137
and their early mythology
involves the Tiamat.

27:21.548 --> 27:23.307
Tiamat comes from the sea.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.101
She's a sea serpent.
She is chaos.

27:28.222 --> 27:31.540
HENRY: Dragons are most
often seen flying through the sky.

27:31.633 --> 27:33.709
However, there are also examples

27:33.727 --> 27:37.062
of dragons that lived
in the water.

27:37.214 --> 27:40.883
For example, in the
Babylonian myth of Tiamat

27:40.901 --> 27:42.901
and then in the Greek myth
we learn of Hydra,

27:42.995 --> 27:47.055
which is referred to as a dragon
that lives in the sea.

27:48.726 --> 27:52.318
NARRATOR: Serpents from the sea
can also be found in Norse mythology,

27:52.338 --> 27:55.321
in the ancient Canaanite
tradition,

27:55.341 --> 27:58.509
as well as the Maori tales
of New Zealand.

28:00.495 --> 28:01.845
But of all the stories

28:02.072 --> 28:04.515
of sea dragons
from across the globe,

28:04.666 --> 28:06.684
perhaps there is none
more well-known

28:06.835 --> 28:09.687
than the Leviathan
of the Hebrew Bible.

28:09.838 --> 28:13.582
Often described as
a gigantic sea creature,

28:13.600 --> 28:17.177
the Leviathan wreaks chaos
on the world.

28:17.196 --> 28:20.513
Leviathan, in Biblical terms,

28:20.607 --> 28:26.686
is considered this sea monster
of behemoth proportions. Huge.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.448
Now, in the Book of Job,

28:29.542 --> 28:33.377
the behemoth all of a sudden
is seen and witnessed.

28:33.528 --> 28:39.441
And the way Job describes it,
it's not a biological entity

28:39.534 --> 28:41.719
that we are familiar with today.

28:41.870 --> 28:46.372
It is described
that it has skin of metal

28:46.392 --> 28:50.786
and ribs made
out of gleaming bronze,

28:50.804 --> 28:54.565
its limbs like bars of iron.

28:54.716 --> 28:58.961
Its back is made
of shields in rows

28:59.054 --> 29:03.315
shut up closely as with a seal.

29:03.467 --> 29:05.909
And then Job even describes

29:06.136 --> 29:11.064
that it is like
some type of an animal,

29:11.158 --> 29:16.086
but what animal breathes smoke
and fire and has glowing eyes?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.591
NARRATOR: Might the
eyewitness account of the Leviathan

29:20.742 --> 29:22.742
found in the Book of Job

29:22.836 --> 29:24.503
actually be a description

29:24.655 --> 29:26.488
not of an underwater creature

29:26.581 --> 29:29.249
but of misunderstood technology,

29:29.268 --> 29:32.752
as ancient astronaut
theorists suggest?

29:32.772 --> 29:36.089
In the Book of Job
we have a text line

29:36.108 --> 29:40.093
that says that this
creature's outer skin

29:40.112 --> 29:42.687
consists of two hulls.

29:42.840 --> 29:46.784
So, this description
in ancient biblical times

29:47.011 --> 29:52.197
that we have a double-hull
object is interesting

29:52.291 --> 29:57.686
because we know today
that submarines have two hulls.

29:57.704 --> 30:00.539
And the reason why
they have two hulls is

30:00.691 --> 30:04.301
in order to dive and resurface.

30:04.452 --> 30:08.788
And what happens is you fill
and empty the ballast tanks.

30:09.975 --> 30:14.311
Now, what happens when you
empty the ballast tanks?

30:14.538 --> 30:19.316
The submarine ejects
a whole bunch of air

30:19.543 --> 30:22.544
that makes the whole
surrounding area look

30:22.563 --> 30:25.564
as if the ocean is boiling.

30:26.717 --> 30:31.236
And we have exactly
this reference point in Job

30:31.388 --> 30:34.498
that all of a sudden,
the wake of the Leviathan,

30:34.725 --> 30:37.576
it looked as if
the sea was boiling.

30:37.670 --> 30:42.822
Job describes having seen
this thing also on land.

30:42.842 --> 30:46.751
It begs the question if what
we have here is an example

30:46.846 --> 30:49.329
of a trans-medium craft,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.740
a craft that operates

30:51.833 --> 30:54.977
both on land and in the water.

30:56.338 --> 30:59.005
HENRY: Today we have
videos of UFOs or UAPs

30:59.024 --> 31:01.766
that are coming
and going from the ocean.

31:01.919 --> 31:04.361
We call them trans-medium craft.

31:04.512 --> 31:06.254
Well, this is exactly
what we see

31:06.273 --> 31:08.106
in these ancient myths
about the dragons.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.033
These are supposed to be

31:10.185 --> 31:12.035
dragons
or mythological creatures,

31:12.262 --> 31:14.037
winged creatures
that fly in the air,

31:14.189 --> 31:16.522
but then they also go
into the ocean.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.876
And it makes you wonder,
are these in fact UFOs

31:19.027 --> 31:20.711
that were seen
in the ancient world

31:20.862 --> 31:24.106
that were interpreted
or mythologized as dragons?

31:24.199 --> 31:25.698
I was in the Navy
for nine years,

31:25.718 --> 31:27.609
and we always talked
with each other

31:27.702 --> 31:30.112
about unidentified
submersible objects

31:30.130 --> 31:32.538
that are UFOs
that stay in the water

31:32.558 --> 31:35.041
and then bust out
of the top of the ocean

31:35.060 --> 31:37.728
and off they go.
It's very widespread.

31:37.955 --> 31:40.305
As a matter of fact,
there've been reports

31:40.399 --> 31:43.883
of lights down in the water
following our Navy ships

31:43.903 --> 31:45.402
and then all of a sudden

31:45.553 --> 31:47.295
they bust through
the top of the ocean

31:47.314 --> 31:49.555
and they take off.
They're out there.

31:49.650 --> 31:51.557
And it's entirely possible

31:51.577 --> 31:54.653
that people who witnessed
these things a long time ago

31:54.805 --> 31:58.564
confused them with
creatures or real dragons.

31:59.826 --> 32:03.812
Could the accounts of dragons
emerging from the sea

32:03.830 --> 32:06.481
found in mythologies
around the world

32:06.500 --> 32:10.594
be descriptions of an advanced
technology capable of traveling

32:10.745 --> 32:15.157
not only through the sky
but also through water?

32:15.175 --> 32:16.675
And if so,

32:16.827 --> 32:18.584
might the misinterpreted craft

32:18.679 --> 32:20.771
our ancestors witnessed

32:20.922 --> 32:24.499
be the same UFOs
reportedly seen today?

32:24.592 --> 32:27.686
Ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

32:27.780 --> 32:30.930
the answers may be found
by examining the alignment

32:30.950 --> 32:33.358
of an ancient structure
to a dragon...

32:33.452 --> 32:35.410
in the stars.

32:41.609 --> 32:43.627
NARRATOR:
Northwest Cambodia.

32:44.797 --> 32:47.205
Just outside the city
of Siem Reap

32:47.357 --> 32:51.468
lies Angkor Wat, the world's
largest religious structure,

32:51.695 --> 32:54.638
with each side measuring
nearly a mile long.

32:56.049 --> 32:59.884
Mainstream archaeologists
believe the temple complex

32:59.979 --> 33:03.629
was likely constructed
around the 12th century AD,

33:03.649 --> 33:05.540
but according
to Cambodian legend,

33:05.559 --> 33:08.043
it is far older--

33:08.061 --> 33:10.470
Built in 600 BC

33:10.489 --> 33:13.548
by a half-human
half-divine architect

33:13.567 --> 33:17.385
who traveled between Earth
and the realm of the gods.

33:17.479 --> 33:19.812
TSOUKALOS:
Angkor Wat was built

33:19.832 --> 33:23.058
by none other
than Preah Pisnokar.

33:23.076 --> 33:26.003
His mother is not of this world.

33:26.230 --> 33:29.840
She wants to bring him
to where she comes from.

33:31.176 --> 33:34.069
And so she takes her son

33:34.162 --> 33:37.330
to what's called Indra's Heaven.

33:37.424 --> 33:39.741
According to mythologies,

33:39.834 --> 33:42.502
the center part of Angkor Wat

33:42.596 --> 33:45.505
is a one-to-one replica

33:45.524 --> 33:48.984
of whatever was seen out there.

33:51.104 --> 33:52.937
NARRATOR:
According to some experts,

33:53.090 --> 33:55.365
the layout of Angkor Wat reveals

33:55.592 --> 33:58.035
another intriguing
connection to the cosmos.

33:59.263 --> 34:01.204
In 1996,

34:01.356 --> 34:03.856
author and researcher
John Grigsby

34:03.876 --> 34:06.192
discovered
that the temple complex

34:06.211 --> 34:10.380
appears to align with certain
stars in the night sky.

34:10.607 --> 34:13.291
John Grigsby made
a brilliant discovery.

34:13.443 --> 34:16.611
He noticed that the entire
Angkor Wat complex

34:16.630 --> 34:19.556
is a mirror image
of the Draco constellation.

34:20.801 --> 34:24.394
In Latin, the word
Draco means dragon.

34:26.214 --> 34:27.806
TSOUKALOS:
If you were to take

34:27.958 --> 34:30.567
a constellation map of Draco

34:30.794 --> 34:34.387
and superimpose it
onto a map of Angkor Wat,

34:34.481 --> 34:39.317
there are multiple structures
at Angkor Wat that line up

34:39.469 --> 34:43.914
exactly to the main stars
of the constellation of Draco.

34:45.309 --> 34:49.068
So you have to wonder
what the connection is.

34:49.088 --> 34:51.588
And the answer to that,
in my opinion,

34:51.739 --> 34:56.409
is that if you would like
to show a local population

34:56.428 --> 34:59.412
where you are from...

34:59.431 --> 35:02.173
you have them build something

35:02.326 --> 35:04.917
in the constellation
of where you are from.

35:04.937 --> 35:07.420
To me, those are calling cards

35:07.439 --> 35:10.565
where our teachers
long ago came from.

35:12.352 --> 35:14.260
NARRATOR:
Is it possible that the story

35:14.279 --> 35:17.597
of Angkor Wat's
celestial origins is true

35:17.616 --> 35:20.450
and that it was
purposely designed

35:20.602 --> 35:23.102
to line up
with the stars of Draco

35:23.122 --> 35:27.515
because this was the ancestral
home of Preah Pisnokar?

35:27.609 --> 35:29.942
Ancient astronaut
theorists point

35:29.962 --> 35:32.629
to the temple's many depictions
of dragon-like creatures

35:32.780 --> 35:34.297
as further evidence

35:34.449 --> 35:36.524
that it has
a profound connection

35:36.543 --> 35:38.468
to the Draco constellation.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.380
DOMINIC STEAVU:
In south Asian traditions,

35:42.532 --> 35:44.975
nagas occupy an important place.

35:45.126 --> 35:48.812
They are considered to be
very powerful creatures.

35:48.963 --> 35:51.039
They are shape shifters.

35:51.057 --> 35:54.651
And nagas share a number
of interesting similarities

35:54.802 --> 35:56.987
with Chinese dragons
more specifically,

35:57.138 --> 36:01.158
so both of them are givers
of knowledge and of wisdom.

36:03.053 --> 36:04.903
HENRY: In the same way
that Kukulkan seems

36:05.055 --> 36:07.664
to represent some sort
of a craft to the Mayans,

36:07.815 --> 36:11.501
we find the same thing
with the naga at Angkor Wat.

36:11.728 --> 36:14.229
They could represent
a craft that is utilized

36:14.247 --> 36:16.673
to transport people
from Earth to Draco.

36:18.235 --> 36:19.676
NARRATOR:
Is it possible

36:19.903 --> 36:22.570
that dragon traditions
throughout the globe

36:22.589 --> 36:25.240
originated with visitors
coming to Earth

36:25.258 --> 36:28.310
from a planet somewhere
within the Draco constellation?

36:30.096 --> 36:32.747
Curiously, Angkor Wat is not

36:32.766 --> 36:35.859
the only ancient site
that aligns with Draco.

36:36.086 --> 36:39.604
On the other side
of the world, in Ohio,

36:39.756 --> 36:43.591
a Native American serpent
effigy known as Serpent Mound

36:43.685 --> 36:46.369
was positioned
to point to Draco.

36:48.189 --> 36:50.098
And in ancient Egypt,

36:50.116 --> 36:52.617
all pyramids were positioned

36:52.711 --> 36:55.603
to have an entrance passage
geometrically aligned

36:55.622 --> 36:59.216
so that Draco's primary
star, Alpha Draconis...

36:59.367 --> 37:02.385
would be visible at night.

37:04.038 --> 37:07.799
It's interesting to think
that the constellation Draco

37:07.951 --> 37:10.952
may have something to do
with these dragon myths,

37:11.045 --> 37:13.304
with all of these
separate cultures

37:13.457 --> 37:16.566
around the world that are
seemingly unconnected.

37:16.718 --> 37:20.886
Whatever these
flying dragons are,

37:20.981 --> 37:24.299
perhaps they came from a planet

37:24.317 --> 37:26.409
that was from
the star system Draco.

37:28.154 --> 37:30.747
HENRY: Virtually every culture
has a legend about dragons

37:30.974 --> 37:33.308
or dragon beings
that came from the sky.

37:33.326 --> 37:35.493
And what we're uncovering now
is the revelation

37:35.645 --> 37:37.328
that these beings
came from the sky

37:37.481 --> 37:40.331
because they're
of extraterrestrial origins.

37:40.484 --> 37:42.500
Is it possible that today

37:42.594 --> 37:45.762
we're subconsciously tapping
into hidden knowledge,

37:45.913 --> 37:47.839
something that has
always been there

37:47.933 --> 37:50.725
and is part of, like,
the thought sphere of humanity?

37:52.012 --> 37:54.012
NARRATOR:
Could it be

37:54.106 --> 37:56.664
that humankind's long-held
fascination with dragons

37:56.683 --> 37:59.684
has a direct link to the cosmos

37:59.778 --> 38:01.669
and possibly visitors

38:01.763 --> 38:04.096
from the constellation of Draco?

38:04.116 --> 38:06.599
Have stories
and imagery of dragons

38:06.693 --> 38:08.359
persisted in modern times

38:08.512 --> 38:10.695
because of a deep-seated desire

38:10.847 --> 38:14.291
to reconnect with our
extraterrestrial past?

38:14.442 --> 38:17.276
Perhaps further clues
can be found

38:17.296 --> 38:21.947
by examining humanity's
latest endeavors beyond Earth

38:21.967 --> 38:25.969
and the recent launch
of a spacecraft called<i> Dragon.</i>

38:26.120 --> 38:27.470
MAN:
And liftoff.

38:37.983 --> 38:40.800
NARRATOR: Just off the
coast of Panama, Florida,

38:40.894 --> 38:46.990
the latest SpaceX cargo shuttle,
called<i> Dragon,</i> splashes down.

38:47.141 --> 38:49.067
It's really fascinating
what's happening right now

38:49.219 --> 38:53.830
because SpaceX just named
their rocket<i> Dragon.</i>

38:55.225 --> 38:59.002
The Chinese named
their entire rocket fleet

38:59.229 --> 39:03.989
based on ancient Chinese
celestial mythology.

39:04.009 --> 39:06.325
It's called
the Shengzou program,

39:06.345 --> 39:08.736
and Shengzou means
"heavenly chariot."

39:08.755 --> 39:12.090
So, to have all of a sudden

39:12.184 --> 39:16.411
modern cultures refer
to their celestial vehicles

39:16.504 --> 39:19.097
as dragons or heavenly chariot

39:19.191 --> 39:23.526
to me is nothing else
but a repetition of history,

39:23.753 --> 39:28.365
meaning we are not
the first to do this.

39:28.516 --> 39:32.035
JONATHAN YOUNG: The image of
the dragon still excites our imagination.

39:32.262 --> 39:34.854
When Elon Musk decides
to build a spaceship

39:34.873 --> 39:36.114
to lift up to the stars,

39:36.208 --> 39:38.116
he names it<i> Dragon.</i>

39:38.268 --> 39:41.269
So, it's almost like we're
acting out mythology.

39:41.362 --> 39:43.529
We're riding on or in a dragon

39:43.548 --> 39:45.048
back up to the stars.

39:47.386 --> 39:50.720
TSOUKALOS: Clearly,
humankind has had a love affair,

39:50.947 --> 39:54.349
an eternal fascination
with dragons.

39:55.042 --> 39:56.968
And in my opinion,

39:57.062 --> 40:01.398
dragons did not really exist
in a biological form,

40:01.549 --> 40:04.901
but perhaps they were the result

40:05.052 --> 40:07.553
of an incredible event

40:07.572 --> 40:10.148
that happened
a long, long time ago

40:10.300 --> 40:12.409
in our collective unconscious.

40:13.820 --> 40:15.745
It may surprise a lot of people

40:15.972 --> 40:18.489
to know that,
throughout the world,

40:18.642 --> 40:21.976
the dragon is not
a symbol of evil.

40:21.995 --> 40:26.589
It's certainly not in China.

40:26.741 --> 40:29.000
It's a symbol of
good luck and fortune.

40:29.152 --> 40:31.428
In the Middle East,

40:31.579 --> 40:35.673
the serpent brings knowledge
and understanding.

40:35.825 --> 40:41.179
Even today, we have the symbol
of a serpent, a winged snake,

40:41.331 --> 40:44.941
associated with knowledge
on the medical badge.

40:46.260 --> 40:49.595
Virtually every culture
in the known ancient world

40:49.614 --> 40:52.431
has some kind of dragon legend,
every single one of them.

40:52.525 --> 40:54.951
The dragon represents something

40:55.102 --> 40:58.913
incredibly powerful
but also incredibly noble.

41:00.459 --> 41:03.851
HENRY: Dragons are something
that people are obsessed with.

41:03.945 --> 41:06.854
Even today
people still get tattoos

41:06.873 --> 41:08.131
of dragons on their bodies.

41:08.282 --> 41:09.632
And you wonder, why is it?

41:09.859 --> 41:11.876
What is the attraction
with dragons?

41:12.028 --> 41:13.528
Well, for one thing,

41:13.546 --> 41:15.972
dragons symbolize divine
and heavenly power.

41:16.123 --> 41:18.049
But behind that is
the realization

41:18.143 --> 41:21.293
that the dragons ultimately
represent our origins.

41:21.387 --> 41:23.646
They were the great civilizers.

41:23.798 --> 41:25.890
They were the founders
of civilization.

41:26.042 --> 41:28.392
So by connecting ourselves
with the dragons,

41:28.487 --> 41:31.729
we're actually trying to tap
into the original power

41:31.881 --> 41:33.323
of those divine beings.

41:36.219 --> 41:38.477
NARRATOR: Could it be that
traditions of dragons

41:38.497 --> 41:40.163
found all over the world

41:40.390 --> 41:43.666
tell the story of
humankind's true origins?

41:44.836 --> 41:46.503
Is it possible

41:46.730 --> 41:48.579
that our celebration
of these winged beasts

41:48.732 --> 41:50.507
is actually commemorating

41:50.734 --> 41:54.085
ancient contact
with extraterrestrials?

41:54.237 --> 41:55.995
Perhaps we will find the answer

41:56.014 --> 42:00.575
as we send our own dragons
into the sky

42:00.593 --> 42:04.670
and reconnect
with our alien ancestors.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.690
