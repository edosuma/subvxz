to Italy on business.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.800
Blair was going to France.

35:50.887 --> 35:53.412
So are you planning
to spend the summer

35:53.499 --> 35:55.370
sweating it out in Brooklyn?

35:55.457 --> 35:58.025
Uh, I think my time
across the bridge is over.

35:58.112 --> 36:01.637
[Chuck]
Nathaniel, what happened
with you and Punky Brewster?

36:01.724 --> 36:03.987
So tell me. What-what exactly
happened with you and man bangs?

36:04.074 --> 36:05.728
[laughs]
He is prettier than me.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.513
- But that wasn't the problem.
- And what was it then?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.471
The, uh, the whole perpetually
stoned, brooding guy thing?

36:09.558 --> 36:10.864
I actually enjoyed the quiet.

36:10.951 --> 36:12.257
It was a nice change
of pace from you.

36:12.344 --> 36:14.302
Oh. Was it his past with Serena?

36:14.389 --> 36:17.087
No. That's just your issue.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.002
It must've been, uh, the-the
different worlds thing, right?

36:19.089 --> 36:20.874
One of you always feeling
like a fish out of water?

36:24.312 --> 36:26.314
I know exactly
what you're doing.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.794
Ask me enough questions
about Nate

36:27.881 --> 36:29.317
and I won't ask you
about Serena.

36:29.404 --> 36:30.971
Best offense is always
a strong defense.

36:32.755 --> 36:38.674
I, um, I'm not ready
to talk about it. Her.

36:38.761 --> 36:40.676
Good. Then maybe it'll be
quiet for 30 seconds.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.243
No, no, no, no, no. You better
get used to it, Abrams.

36:42.330 --> 36:44.680
Welcome to the summer
of Dan Humphrey

36:44.767 --> 36:47.292

from dusk till dawn.

36:47.379 --> 36:50.512
Come Labor Day,
you're gonna be so sick of me.

36:50.599 --> 36:53.080
It's been 13 years,
and I'm still not sick of you.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.995
Oh, not for lack of trying.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.475
[Nate]
Oh, Vanessa's a great girl.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.520
'I just have too much
going on right now.'

36:58.607 --> 37:00.740
Alright. Alright. Bye.

37:00.827 --> 37:02.220
- Hey!
- Hey!

37:02.307 --> 37:03.830
I was just seeing off Blair.

37:03.917 --> 37:06.093
I was just on the phone
with Chuck.

37:06.180 --> 37:09.488
Blair and Chuck, now there's
a couple you can root for.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.794
Yeah, well, if they're happy,
I guess I'm happy.

37:11.881 --> 37:14.144
Oh, come on, Nate.
When have you ever been happy?

37:14.232 --> 37:16.669
Wow! The gloves are off today,
aren't they?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.627
[laughs]
I am feeling frisky.

37:18.714 --> 37:20.194
You know how I get
in the summer.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.978
- Ha-ha.
- Yeah, I do.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.676
Well, you won't have
to witness any of it.

37:23.763 --> 37:26.156
I'm locking myself away
in the Hamptons house.

37:26.244 --> 37:29.943
Well, it is a summer
to reflect alone.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.032
I could not agree more.

37:32.119 --> 37:35.035
I just need to take a break away
from everything and everyone.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.384
Yeah.

37:42.912 --> 37:49.179
Hey, um, if you wanna reflect
alone together, I'll be around.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.094
What are you up to now?

37:55.751 --> 37:58.014
Excuse me.
Is that the Bass helicopter?

37:58.101 --> 37:59.451
No, it's not here yet.

37:59.538 --> 38:01.409
Are you on the Bass
marketing team too?

38:01.496 --> 38:03.106
No, I'm a guest of Chuck Bass.

38:03.193 --> 38:05.021
If he's anything like his father

38:05.108 --> 38:07.110
he must be terrifying.

38:07.197 --> 38:09.156
He's not all bad.
He is taking me to Tuscany.

38:09.243 --> 38:11.506
That's romantic.

38:11.593 --> 38:13.639
- So where is he?
- On his way.

38:13.726 --> 38:15.467
I had to get here early.
I like the jump seat.

38:15.554 --> 38:16.859
Oh.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.121
- What?
- Nothing.

38:18.208 --> 38:20.254
It's just
I like the jump seat.

38:20.341 --> 38:21.516
I have this thing about flying

38:21.603 --> 38:22.909
and it makes me feel more--

38:22.996 --> 38:24.650
In control?

- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:29.568 --> 38:30.656
Who's that?

38:30.743 --> 38:33.441
Blair. I should get going.

38:33.528 --> 38:36.183
I just wanted to see you before
I disappeared for the summer.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.445
I'm glad you had a good trip.

38:37.532 --> 38:38.838
I hope you have
a good trip too.

38:38.925 --> 38:41.101
You deserve it.

38:41.188 --> 38:44.496
And I must say
I'm proud of you.

38:44.583 --> 38:46.933
Dad, my best man speech was
a week ago, and it was nothing.

38:47.020 --> 38:48.848
Polite? Modest?

38:48.935 --> 38:52.068
- You really are growing up.
- Let's not get carried away.

38:52.155 --> 38:54.070
I plan on holding on to my youth
for as long as possible.

38:54.157 --> 38:55.507
Sometimes that choice
isn't up to you.

38:55.594 --> 38:58.031
That's the best thing
about Blair.

38:58.118 --> 39:01.687
She knows me,
knows I'll never change.

39:01.774 --> 39:05.473
Yeah, until you take her away
to Europe on a private jet.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.042
That is gonna change everything.

39:09.129 --> 39:12.567
But that's a good thing, son.

39:12.654 --> 39:15.875
Having a real girlfriend
will force you

39:15.962 --> 39:19.792
to learn about responsibility,
sacrifice

39:19.879 --> 39:22.664
being faithful,
taking into account

39:22.751 --> 39:25.232
somebody else's feelings,
not just your own.

39:26.538 --> 39:27.669
Feelings?

39:29.323 --> 39:32.761
All the partying and the women.

39:32.848 --> 39:35.895
You will come back
from this summer a new man.

39:37.723 --> 39:39.594
Take my word for it.

39:41.509 --> 39:42.902
Oh, I will.

39:42.989 --> 39:46.340
[laughing]
Oh! There you are.

39:46.427 --> 39:48.081
This is Amelia.

39:48.168 --> 39:50.562
She's been helping me
with the apartment renovations.

39:50.649 --> 39:52.520

Nice to meet you.

40:33.909 --> 40:35.345
What's this?

40:35.433 --> 40:36.695
I was hoping we could discuss

40:36.782 --> 40:39.524
what you have planned
for my room.

40:39.611 --> 40:40.960
And who are you?

40:42.570 --> 40:44.006
I'm Chuck Bass.

"Do You Wanna"]

40:56.149 --> 40:57.803
Everything alright?

40:57.890 --> 40:59.369
Yeah. It-it's Chuck.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.762
I guess his dad
is getting in late

41:00.849 --> 41:03.112
and he won't be able
to make the flight.

41:03.199 --> 41:05.288
But he's booking
something commercial.

41:05.375 --> 41:07.813
Well, I'd be willing
to flip you for the jump seat.

41:12.034 --> 41:14.297
Bart did just get
the jet re-upholstered

41:14.384 --> 41:16.865

make you those cookies.

The path not taken
can become a road trip.
