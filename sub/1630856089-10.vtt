[birds chirping]

00:20.840 --> 00:22.840
[inhales slowly]

00:23.440 --> 00:25.000
[exhales deeply]

00:35.080 --> 00:36.120
[Camilla sighs]

00:41.520 --> 00:43.520
[bagpipes playing outside]

[exhales slowly]

[bagpipes continue]

01:04.080 --> 01:06.080
[classical music playing on speakers]

01:11.920 --> 01:14.400
[Queen's dresser] <i>You have
an investiture ceremony at 11:00,</i>

01:14.400 --> 01:17.000
then lunch with
the Commonwealth secretary-general,

01:17.000 --> 01:21.040
so I thought the black shoes and low heel,

01:21.040 --> 01:24.360
which also works well
for the first meeting after breakfast.

01:24.360 --> 01:25.280
Remind me.

01:25.280 --> 01:29.280
The Duke of Edinburgh, Lord Chamberlain,
and the Duke of Norfolk.

01:29.280 --> 01:32.600
Oh, yes. Did we ever discover
what that was about?

01:32.600 --> 01:34.160
[Queen's dresser] They wouldn't say.

01:34.680 --> 01:36.600
That's not normally a good sign.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.760
[radio pips]

01:41.680 --> 01:43.840
[newsreader] <i>Good morning.
The time is nine o'clock,</i>

01:43.840 --> 01:45.880
<i>and here are the news headlines for today.</i>

01:45.880 --> 01:47.560
<i>It has been almost two years</i>

01:47.560 --> 01:50.920
<i>since the British
and American forces went to war with Iraq.</i>

01:50.920 --> 01:53.520
<i>The justification for the invasion
at the time,</i>

01:53.520 --> 01:55.160
<i>that Saddam Hussein had amassed</i>

01:55.160 --> 01:58.120
<i>a huge stockpile
of weapons of mass destruction.</i>

01:58.840 --> 02:01.240
<i>Now, with the secretary-general
of the UN openly...</i>

02:01.240 --> 02:02.440
It's ridiculous.

02:02.440 --> 02:07.360
<i>...as illegal, the IAEA hasn't been invited
to restart full inspections.</i>

02:07.360 --> 02:08.360
Marry me.

02:08.360 --> 02:10.200
<i>Instead, investigations into WMDs</i>

02:10.200 --> 02:12.840
<i>are now carried out
by the Iraq Survey Group.</i>

02:13.520 --> 02:14.360
<i>The search for...</i>

02:14.360 --> 02:18.120
That's not a proposal. I can't do that
without my mother's permission,

02:18.120 --> 02:23.440
but... I realize, more than anything
in the world, I want you to be my wife.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.640
<i>...chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons</i>

02:25.640 --> 02:27.640
<i>have still not been unearthed.</i>

02:27.640 --> 02:30.600
<i>Many people who supported the war
are now asking...</i>

02:30.600 --> 02:32.840
That's a complete disaster.

02:33.640 --> 02:37.800
<i>...including the prime minister's claim that
Saddam's apparently non-existent weapons</i>

02:37.800 --> 02:40.040
<i>could be deployed within 45 minutes.</i>

02:40.040 --> 02:44.080
[Duke of Norfolk] So the Scots Guards
will be here. The Coldstream Guards...

02:44.080 --> 02:46.760
[indistinct overlapping chatter]

02:46.760 --> 02:48.880
Rest on a platform near the High Altar.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.040
Oh...

02:50.040 --> 02:51.120
[Philip exhales]

02:53.920 --> 02:56.240
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- [men] Good morning.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.160
[David] Your Majesty.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.200
The purpose of this meeting is,

03:00.200 --> 03:03.000
and it's not because we have
any reason to be fearful--

03:03.000 --> 03:04.960
[Philip] Oh, get on with it, David.

03:04.960 --> 03:10.120
That we might really step up our planning
of Operation London Bridge.

03:10.120 --> 03:13.320
That's the code name
for your funeral, ma'am.

03:13.320 --> 03:15.040
We know what it is, Edward.

03:15.720 --> 03:18.720
Is that really necessary?
I recently got a clean bill of health,

03:18.720 --> 03:20.240
and in terms of age, I'm only--

03:20.240 --> 03:23.520
- Eighty.
- Yes, all right. Not quite.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.040
A matter of months.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.800
Simply for reasons of prudence
and good order.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.920
Why not start with the Duke of Edinburgh?

03:29.920 --> 03:33.800
He's older than me. And, statistically,
men tend to die earlier.

03:33.800 --> 03:37.520
Well, that's true, and that's why
we've been working on mine for years.

03:37.520 --> 03:39.720
Operation Forth Bridge.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.320
- Oh... Oh, don't say that.
- Why?

03:42.920 --> 03:44.160
It's so sad.

03:44.840 --> 03:46.040
[Philip laughs] No!

03:46.040 --> 03:48.880
No, I'm finding it all rather stimulating.

03:49.440 --> 03:50.800
You might too.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.160
It's surprising what it all stirs up.
Isn't it, Edward?

03:54.160 --> 03:57.720
Yes. So, with your permission, ma'am,
can we make a start?

04:05.280 --> 04:07.280
[gentle instrumental music plays]

04:16.160 --> 04:20.040
As a template, we've used
the funeral of the late King George VI.

04:21.000 --> 04:24.560
We would call on
an estimated 6,000 military personnel

04:24.560 --> 04:25.520
for the procession.

04:26.400 --> 04:31.080
A tri-service parade
embracing each of the armed services,

04:31.600 --> 04:36.320
alongside representatives
from the 15 other Commonwealth realms.

04:36.920 --> 04:40.480
[voice fading] The gun carriage
will be drawn by the Sovereign's Guard.

04:40.480 --> 04:44.240
They will march at the customary rhythm
of 75 paces per minute...

04:44.240 --> 04:46.320
[haunting choral music playing]

04:56.200 --> 04:58.440
[horse hooves echoing distantly]

04:59.360 --> 05:01.840
[soldiers' footfalls echoing distantly]

05:01.840 --> 05:03.920
[haunting choral music continues]

05:08.880 --> 05:10.880
[soldier's commands echoing distantly]

05:25.400 --> 05:27.520
[theme music playing]

06:33.480 --> 06:36.760
- [whistle blowing]
- [distant overlapping shouts and chants]

06:36.760 --> 06:38.760
Out, out, out!

06:44.560 --> 06:45.960
[siren whooping]

06:45.960 --> 06:47.840
[shouting and chanting continues]

06:49.160 --> 06:50.600
Out, out, out!

06:54.960 --> 06:56.000
What's going on?

06:56.520 --> 06:58.440
The prime minister's just coming out, sir.

06:58.440 --> 07:01.120
- [man 1] No! Hey! Hey!
- [man 2] You war criminal!

07:01.120 --> 07:03.040
- [horn honks]
- [man 3] You warmonger!

07:03.040 --> 07:05.120
[all clamoring]

07:08.160 --> 07:10.000
[siren blaring]

07:12.880 --> 07:14.920
[Charles] <i>Remember when
he first came to power?</i>

07:14.920 --> 07:16.880
<i>They took to the streets and cheered.</i>

07:17.400 --> 07:20.840
<i>Now they want to impeach him
for high crimes and misdemeanors.</i>

07:21.880 --> 07:24.480
<i>And Tony Blair's become Tony B-liar.</i>

07:25.160 --> 07:29.080
<i>One is reminded once again that
the career of prime ministers is nasty,</i>

07:29.080 --> 07:30.720
brutish, and short.

07:31.480 --> 07:34.600
He has no intention of stepping down.
His ambition is to become

07:34.600 --> 07:37.840
the first Labour prime minister
to win a third successive term.

07:38.480 --> 07:39.360
That's the thing.

07:40.080 --> 07:43.480
Once people get a taste of life
at the top, they never want to leave.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.520
Is that right?

07:44.520 --> 07:47.680
They just want to keep... on and on.

07:48.720 --> 07:53.160
Yes. Anyway, I'm sure this is not why
you've come to see me today.

07:53.160 --> 07:54.120
No.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.880
I've come to make a request
I wish I'd made 30 years ago.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.120
To ask your blessing

08:11.000 --> 08:12.280
to marry Camilla.

08:15.760 --> 08:18.320
You can't say this has come
out of the blue, Mummy.

08:18.320 --> 08:21.400
She and I have been in love now
for 30 years.

08:23.200 --> 08:26.040
And every day of those 30 years,
she has been heroic.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.480
You don't think ending her relationship
with you once you'd married Diana

08:31.480 --> 08:32.840
would have been "heroic"?

08:32.840 --> 08:33.760
She did.

08:33.760 --> 08:37.760
Camilla is blameless in that regard.
She always wanted to keep her marriage.

08:37.760 --> 08:39.040
Then why didn't she?

08:39.720 --> 08:42.800
- Because her husband left.
- And why did he do that?

08:42.800 --> 08:45.360
Because he'd had enough,
as I understand it,

08:45.360 --> 08:47.920
of reading about her adultery with you
in the newspapers.

08:47.920 --> 08:52.040
You and I both know Andrew is no angel.
He was serially unfaithful himself.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.080
So, can we agree?
There's nothing heroic about any of this.

08:55.920 --> 08:59.520
For years and years,
Camilla has suffered judgment and calumny

08:59.520 --> 09:02.760
and never, ever complained. Not once.

09:02.760 --> 09:04.600
<i>That</i> is heroic.

09:06.320 --> 09:08.200
Instead, she's stayed silent.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.400
And loyal, to you and the Crown.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.080
With not a single thank you in return.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.640
- A thank you?
- Yes, thank you.

09:17.640 --> 09:21.560
Not just for her discretion,
but for loving and making happy

09:21.560 --> 09:23.560
the person who's next in line.

09:25.320 --> 09:29.320
That, surely, is in all our interests.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.600
[indistinct chattering outside]

09:38.200 --> 09:39.600
[Charles] What is he doing?

09:41.320 --> 09:43.000
Planning his funeral.

09:44.280 --> 09:46.600
He wants that as his hearse.

09:50.760 --> 09:53.280
You always said, Mummy,
that you couldn't do the job

09:53.280 --> 09:54.920
without Papa by your side.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.600
That he's your strength and stay.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.640
[gentle instrumental music plays]

10:02.480 --> 10:04.160
Camilla is my strength.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.120
And my stay.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.760
I couldn't do it without her.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.440
I will reflect on it,

10:14.720 --> 10:15.960
take advice,

10:17.640 --> 10:19.400
and give you an answer soon.

10:24.360 --> 10:25.200
Thank you.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.720
[indistinct conversations outside]

10:38.040 --> 10:39.160
[door opens]

10:41.800 --> 10:42.640
[door shuts]

10:42.640 --> 10:44.160
It will probably be fine.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.920
- [crow cawing]
- [chuckles lightly]

10:50.800 --> 10:55.000
You all have in front of you a first draft
of the plans for London Bridge.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.760
Oh, for heaven's sake.

10:57.480 --> 10:59.440
Yes, a little heavy at the moment, ma'am,

10:59.440 --> 11:02.880
but it will shrink down nicely
as you begin to express your preferences.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.680
My preference would be
a quiet service in Scotland,

11:05.680 --> 11:07.640
out of sight, and over in 20 minutes.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.640
[all chuckling]

11:08.640 --> 11:11.400
Perfectly understandable.
But this is the funeral

11:11.400 --> 11:14.640
of what we expect to be
the longest-serving monarch in history.

11:14.640 --> 11:18.200
People will want to celebrate your reign
and mark the end of an era,

11:18.200 --> 11:20.320
not just here, but all around the world.

11:20.320 --> 11:23.760
So, I'd like to start with
the logistical contingencies

11:23.760 --> 11:26.200
depending upon where the, uh,

11:26.200 --> 11:29.920
forgive me, ma'am,
the, uh... death actually occurs.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.120
[David] If it's abroad, ma'am,
or here in the United Kingdom.

11:34.840 --> 11:36.680
I shall do my best to keep it local.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.640
- [all chuckling]
- Thank you, ma'am.

11:40.120 --> 11:45.560
The first chapter is
if the event occurs on a foreign tour.

11:45.560 --> 11:47.120
Please turn to page ten.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.440
["Take Me Out" by Franz Ferdinand playing]

11:51.440 --> 11:53.560
- [air gun fires]
- [sputters] Watch out!

11:53.560 --> 11:56.520
Are you guys going
to Harry Meade's birthday party?

11:56.520 --> 11:57.880
- Definitely.
- When is it?

11:57.880 --> 11:59.320
- Next week.
- [air gun fires]

11:59.320 --> 12:02.880
- [grunts] Bloody hell!
- Should be good. 250 people going.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.160
- Fancy dress.
- [William] I hate fancy dress.

12:05.160 --> 12:06.080
[can clinks]

12:06.080 --> 12:09.400
You have to rent a costume,
which stinks of other people's BO.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.560
Fucking royal twats.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.920
Meet my brother, life and soul.

12:13.920 --> 12:15.480
- [air gun fires]
- Oh!

12:15.480 --> 12:16.480
What's the theme?

12:16.480 --> 12:18.440
- You pricks!
- Colonials and natives.

12:18.440 --> 12:19.520
Then there's that.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.920
- [air guns fire]
- [can clinks]

12:20.920 --> 12:23.520
Think they could have picked
a more offensive theme?

12:23.520 --> 12:27.200
You're such an undergraduate now.
You'd have never said that before uni.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.920
- But now I am saying it.
- Cliché.

12:28.920 --> 12:31.400
That's me done.
I'm out. You fucking idiots!

12:31.400 --> 12:35.120
- Come on, love.
- You're shit. You can't fucking shoot me.

12:35.640 --> 12:36.960
Fuck you. Fuck the rich.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.040
- Well, hit him.
- [Harry] Hold on. Hold on.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.200
- He's going.
- Hold on.

12:40.200 --> 12:41.200
Clip his arse!

12:41.200 --> 12:43.040
[yelps] That's fucking...

12:43.040 --> 12:44.640
- You cunt!
- [Guy] Oh my God.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.400
- Beautiful.
- [Harry laughing]

12:46.400 --> 12:47.840
Your Royal Highnesses!

12:48.600 --> 12:51.800
I've just had a call
from the Queen's private secretary.

12:51.800 --> 12:52.880
[tense notes play]

12:52.880 --> 12:55.960
- Can you come down?
- It's never good when they come in packs.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.240
Yeah.

13:00.240 --> 13:02.320
[tense music builds slowly]

13:02.320 --> 13:04.400
[indistinct conversations]

13:15.760 --> 13:17.760
[chattering quiets down]

13:26.560 --> 13:27.800
[tense music ends]

13:28.400 --> 13:29.440
Your Majesty.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.280
My Lord Bishops.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.720
I asked you all here today

13:34.720 --> 13:40.240
because the Prince of Wales has requested
my permission to marry Mrs. Parker Bowles.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.120
And I think I'd like to grant it.

13:51.400 --> 13:54.360
And, of course,
as head of the Church of England,

13:54.360 --> 13:55.600
that is your right.

13:57.440 --> 13:59.280
But it will not be straightforward.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.880
Or, one suspects, popular?

14:02.880 --> 14:04.880
Why? I was led to believe

14:04.880 --> 14:08.320
the General Synod had eased its stance
on the marriage of divorcees.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.160
Oh, it has,

14:10.800 --> 14:14.920
but... many people
in this country still believe

14:14.920 --> 14:19.480
that the relationship between
the Prince of Wales and Mrs. Parker Bowles

14:19.480 --> 14:23.640
was responsible for the breakdown
of a royal marriage.

14:24.240 --> 14:28.040
The Church, I think, needs to be satisfied

14:28.040 --> 14:30.040
that permitting the new marriage

14:30.040 --> 14:34.560
would not, in effect,
consecrate a past infidelity.

14:35.320 --> 14:38.520
For the Church of England
to be seen to be blessing it

14:38.520 --> 14:41.960
could risk a split
in the Anglican Communion.

14:43.480 --> 14:47.760
One suggestion could be that,
and I would be interested

14:47.760 --> 14:50.360
in hearing the Archbishop
of Canterbury's view,

14:50.360 --> 14:55.040
that the prince and Mrs. Parker Bowles
marry in a civil ceremony

14:55.040 --> 14:57.080
and then have
a church blessing afterwards.

14:57.840 --> 14:59.480
In a registry office?

15:00.640 --> 15:04.800
In the eyes of the Church, no marriage
service is more legitimate than another.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.920
It's more a question of signals.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.560
Appearances.

15:09.480 --> 15:15.240
A condition of the blessing
could be some form of atonement.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.040
Quite so. Some acknowledgment

15:18.040 --> 15:20.680
of wrongdoing on the couple's part.

15:22.520 --> 15:23.400
Ma'am.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.800
The service might include
a prayer of penitence,

15:28.440 --> 15:30.680
in which the couple
join with the congregation

15:30.680 --> 15:32.760
in asking forgiveness for past

15:34.160 --> 15:35.280
wickedness.

15:39.920 --> 15:45.280
I've always taken comfort in the knowledge
that God retaineth not his anger forever

15:45.280 --> 15:47.520
because he delighteth in mercy.

15:49.720 --> 15:52.600
Whatever short-term risk
the marriage may present

15:52.600 --> 15:54.560
to the integrity of the Church,

15:54.560 --> 15:57.600
one has to imagine it would do less damage

15:57.600 --> 15:59.880
than if I were to die a--

15:59.880 --> 16:02.440
Well, it is going to happen one day.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.800

[Elizabeth] I'd like to discuss
your dear papa.

17:14.160 --> 17:17.200
- [William] What's he done now?
- [Elizabeth] Nothing he's done.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.600
It's what he wants to do.

17:22.080 --> 17:25.520
How would you both feel...
about him getting married?

17:25.520 --> 17:26.520
I knew it.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.680
Why can't they carry on as they are?

17:30.280 --> 17:32.040
'Cause Charles will be king one day,

17:32.040 --> 17:35.960
and the last time we had an unmarried king
on the throne, it did not end well.

17:35.960 --> 17:37.240
- But what's the--
- William.

17:39.640 --> 17:42.520
Obviously, both of us
prefer to think of him with Mummy.

17:43.680 --> 17:46.320
And anything other than that... feels...

17:46.320 --> 17:47.600
Wrong. So wrong.

17:49.480 --> 17:52.200
[William] But, I suppose,
this is the reality.

17:53.720 --> 17:55.600
And she does seem to make him happy.

17:57.640 --> 17:58.480
Does she?

17:59.720 --> 18:02.280
[William] And having him happy
and settled is good for us.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.120
And, ultimately, good for...

18:06.120 --> 18:07.200
Good for...?

18:07.960 --> 18:11.680
Well, as you say,
he is going to be king, isn't he? One day?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.360
Yes.

18:14.360 --> 18:17.320
Plus, then he might
finally shut up about it all.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.400
So,

18:22.320 --> 18:23.240
is that a yes?

18:25.120 --> 18:26.280
- Yes.
- [Harry exhales]

18:26.920 --> 18:28.040
[Elizabeth] Thank you.

18:28.840 --> 18:31.960
I didn't want to give my blessing
until you'd given yours.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.360

I'm just trying to be an adult.

I don't expect you
to understand what that feels like.

19:22.320 --> 19:25.240
[Elizabeth] So... congratulations.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.560
There's a great deal of affection
in the country for Harry.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.960
An apology, followed by a...

30:43.680 --> 30:47.000
a period of contrition...
should pave the way for forgiveness.

30:48.520 --> 30:51.000
Is that the advice
you'll be giving yourself over Iraq?

30:53.080 --> 30:56.480
I think we can agree things are
not working out too well over there.

30:58.960 --> 31:03.720
My hope is that... the democratic elections
scheduled for the end of this month

31:03.720 --> 31:07.360
will form the beginnings
of an exit strategy that should allow us

31:07.360 --> 31:09.240
to close this chapter and move on.

31:14.400 --> 31:15.720
Exit strategy.

31:18.200 --> 31:19.040
Ma'am?

31:20.520 --> 31:23.680
That's a subject
that's been coming up a lot recently.

31:33.880 --> 31:35.560
You've got to thread it through.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.640
[projector whirring]

31:36.640 --> 31:37.560
No, thread--

31:39.400 --> 31:42.640
Yes, all right, thank you.
I think-- I remember now. Thank you.

31:45.280 --> 31:46.440
Must go through...

31:49.680 --> 31:50.720
Thank you.

31:54.280 --> 31:55.840
That's it. That's it.

31:57.360 --> 31:58.840
No, why hasn't it gone through?

31:58.840 --> 32:00.600
It's meant to go under here.

32:01.560 --> 32:02.400
And it hasn't.

32:02.400 --> 32:03.920
That's it. Right about...

32:04.720 --> 32:05.600
Stop that.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.120
No.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.640
Yes!

32:08.640 --> 32:10.400
[projector whirring]

32:10.400 --> 32:12.040
Oh, bingo.

32:15.920 --> 32:16.880
Oh, good.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.280
[gentle instrumental music plays]

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
[children's laughter echoes distantly]

33:46.000 --> 33:48.000
[somber music builds slowly]

34:34.320 --> 34:36.320
[breathes deeply]

34:57.960 --> 34:58.840
Ma'am.

34:59.560 --> 35:00.480
[inhales sharply]

35:01.800 --> 35:03.800
[exhales and breathes deeply]

35:21.720 --> 35:24.000
Oh! There you are.

35:24.000 --> 35:27.240
- Yes, here I still am.
- No breakfast?

35:28.360 --> 35:29.320
Wasn't hungry.

35:30.080 --> 35:31.120
Not like you.

35:49.320 --> 35:50.200
How was Harry?

35:50.200 --> 35:51.880
A bit subdued.

35:53.720 --> 35:57.440
His father's got him
mucking out pigs as punishment.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.520
That feels a little Old Testament.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.240
[Philip] <i>I agree.</i>

36:02.960 --> 36:06.480
<i>Harry was foolish to go to that party
dressed in that costume,</i>

36:06.480 --> 36:08.960
<i>but he was bloody unlucky</i>

36:08.960 --> 36:11.680
that a fellow guest
should go to the newspapers like that.

36:11.680 --> 36:12.720
Yes.

36:13.400 --> 36:17.440
So I phoned the costume rental shop,
gave them a piece of my mind.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.800
Why?

36:18.800 --> 36:21.880
[Philip] <i>What will it take
to get you to understand, hmm?</i>

36:21.880 --> 36:24.920
Should I draw it in sodding crayon?

36:26.600 --> 36:28.200
The uniform was inaccurate.

36:29.680 --> 36:32.200
The German Afrika Korps
never wore swastikas.

36:34.640 --> 36:36.240
[laughing]

36:36.240 --> 36:40.040
A fact I impressed upon
the Sandhurst top brass,

36:40.880 --> 36:43.040
who happily agree this latest episode

36:43.040 --> 36:46.240
should not prevent Harry
entering officer training.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.240
Oh, well done.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.920
- To ban him would be madness.
- [Elizabeth] Mmm.

36:49.920 --> 36:53.160
And would only exacerbate
the real problem.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.440
Which is?

36:54.440 --> 36:56.560
[Philip] A lack of a sense of purpose,

36:56.560 --> 36:59.760
due to a failure of responsible parenting.

37:02.440 --> 37:03.320
Yes.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.520
Do you want to discuss anything
before I go?

37:09.520 --> 37:10.560
About what?

37:11.320 --> 37:15.080
Well, the funeral.
What it might have stirred up for you.

37:16.160 --> 37:17.000
No.

37:17.000 --> 37:17.920
Thank you.

37:18.440 --> 37:20.440
Right, well, I'll be off.

37:22.320 --> 37:23.400
Duty calls.

37:25.800 --> 37:26.760
[sighs]

37:35.440 --> 37:38.040
You coward. Why didn't you tell him?

37:41.200 --> 37:44.920
What you've been thinking since
you first started working on your funeral.

37:44.920 --> 37:47.000
In fact, since the golden jubilee.

37:49.080 --> 37:50.880
How tired... no, not just tired,

37:52.240 --> 37:54.200
exhausted you are by it all.

37:55.920 --> 37:56.920
Yes.

37:58.720 --> 38:00.000
[grunts softly]

38:01.800 --> 38:03.280
How ready for a rest.

38:03.280 --> 38:05.360
[somber music builds slowly]

38:05.360 --> 38:07.720
And, at the same time,
how ready he suddenly looks.

38:10.040 --> 38:10.880
Who?

38:11.680 --> 38:12.640
Charles.

38:14.440 --> 38:15.880
Oh, him.

38:16.760 --> 38:17.600
Yes.

38:18.680 --> 38:20.680
[footsteps receding]

38:25.520 --> 38:27.520
[water running]

38:28.600 --> 38:32.640
You even have precedent. Queen Wilhelmina
of the Netherlands was 68

38:32.640 --> 38:34.840
when she stepped down
in favor of her daughter.

38:34.840 --> 38:37.080
Charlotte of Luxembourg
was also in her late sixties.

38:37.080 --> 38:40.840
That's the Netherlands and Luxembourg.
Bicycle monarchies. Not the same thing.

38:40.840 --> 38:44.160
It's exactly the same thing.
And, in both cases, a great success.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.920
You've been on the throne
for over half a century.

38:51.920 --> 38:54.400
- Longer than any queen.
- Apart from Queen Victoria.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.520
How effective was she by the end?

38:57.040 --> 39:00.480
Rheumatic and blind, weak and unwell.
Hidden away on the Isle of Wight.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.160
You're almost 80 years old.

39:03.160 --> 39:04.720
So everyone keeps reminding me.

39:04.720 --> 39:07.560
That's nearly 20 years
past the retirement age for women.

39:08.160 --> 39:10.360
- No need to go on.
- That's what I'm saying.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.240
No need to go on.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.680
Your first loyalty's
always been to the Crown.

39:17.360 --> 39:19.320
Sometimes at the expense
of being a mother.

39:22.120 --> 39:25.120
Stepping down... is the right thing to do.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.760
As Queen and as a mother.

39:40.280 --> 39:41.240
[man] Your Majesty.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.280
[somber music swells]

40:05.240 --> 40:06.320
[music fades out]

40:06.320 --> 40:09.240
Everyone has now agreed on a date
for the wedding.

40:10.240 --> 40:13.120
Ninth of April.
At the Guildhall in Windsor.

40:14.520 --> 40:18.840
Oh, we also felt, given your role
as head of the Church of England

40:18.840 --> 40:22.280
and the Church's position
that marriage is a lifelong commitment,

40:22.280 --> 40:26.480
that it would be wrong
for you to attend the ceremony in person.

40:26.480 --> 40:27.680
[Elizabeth] Mmm.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.400
The idea being
you can watch the coverage on television

40:30.400 --> 40:34.000
and, uh... and then join everyone
for the service at St. George's Chapel.

40:34.520 --> 40:36.680
And the reception at Windsor Castle.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.840
Has the prime minister
been invited to the reception?

40:43.360 --> 40:44.280
Yes, ma'am.

40:44.280 --> 40:46.960
- And the leader of the opposition?
- Yes.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.000
And the Archbishop of Canterbury?

40:49.680 --> 40:50.520
Yes.

40:50.520 --> 40:53.640
And there will be an opportunity
for me to say a few words?

40:54.600 --> 40:59.720
Oh, I'm sure everyone would be delighted.
Would you like me to draft something?

40:59.720 --> 41:02.880
That won't be necessary.
I'll write something myself.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.480
That's all. Thank you, Robin.

41:20.000 --> 41:23.400
[Harry] You were all for the uniform
in the costume shop. Egging me on.

41:23.400 --> 41:25.640
- Suddenly you're Mr. Morality.
- [William] Oh, right.

41:25.640 --> 41:26.960
Stabbing me in the back.

41:26.960 --> 41:29.240
How many faces does this man have?

41:29.240 --> 41:31.200
Not sure I like who you're turning into.

41:31.200 --> 41:34.720
- Not sure I like who you've been.
- Can you stop bickering? I beg you.

41:34.720 --> 41:36.800
[lilting instrumental music plays]

41:36.800 --> 41:38.360
[Camilla] <i>How was supper?</i>

41:38.360 --> 41:40.920
Well, I'm sad to say
it was all rather unpleasant.

41:41.600 --> 41:44.880
- The boys were snapping at each other.
<i>- Well, that's just boys.</i>

41:45.640 --> 41:46.760
Can I make one request?

41:46.760 --> 41:49.680
That you don't make
my wedding day a misery.

41:51.760 --> 41:53.280
I've waited too long for it.

41:54.600 --> 41:58.560
<i>Yes, but you didn't witness it.
It was horrid how they were to each other.</i>

41:58.560 --> 42:01.080
Vicious and unkind.

42:01.680 --> 42:04.200
[Camilla] <i>They're young.
Riding the waves of emotion.</i>

42:04.200 --> 42:06.480
<i>Understandable after
what they've been through.</i>

42:07.720 --> 42:11.440
[Charles] <i>Are they going to blame me,
do you think, and hold me responsible</i>

42:11.440 --> 42:13.320
<i>for the way they've turned out?</i>

42:13.320 --> 42:16.120
Well, being their father,
you <i>are</i> responsible.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.280
For making it better.

42:20.960 --> 42:23.680
<i>As soon as they're through tomorrow,
everything will be fine.</i>

42:25.240 --> 42:26.280
Well, I do hope so.

42:27.200 --> 42:28.160
<i>And how are you?</i>

42:28.160 --> 42:29.080
Me?

42:30.320 --> 42:31.240
I'm all right.

42:32.320 --> 42:36.280
My sister persuaded me to get a fake tan,
so now I smell like the dog's blanket.

42:36.280 --> 42:38.360
[chuckling]

42:42.000 --> 42:44.160
Are you having any last-minute doubts?

42:44.760 --> 42:45.680
Not me.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.120
I'm in.

42:51.000 --> 42:51.880
For all of it?

42:52.720 --> 42:55.680
For whatever being married to you
turns out to be.

42:56.480 --> 43:01.440
Well, you might find out
what that entails sooner than you imagine.

43:01.440 --> 43:03.040
<i>What's that supposed to mean?</i>

43:03.960 --> 43:06.880
Well, I've been told
that the Queen intends to make a speech

43:06.880 --> 43:08.360
at the reception afterwards.

43:09.080 --> 43:12.040
<i>A speech which nobody's seen</i>

43:12.040 --> 43:15.880
and which she's, um... written herself.

43:16.840 --> 43:20.760
<i>It feels like
she's planning a big announcement.</i>

43:22.000 --> 43:25.680
<i>My father met with Anne
to ask what she thought was in it,</i>

43:25.680 --> 43:28.160
<i>but she's as baffled as the rest of us.</i>

43:29.200 --> 43:32.400
<i>Then Anne rang Andrew,
and he went riding with the Queen,</i>

43:32.400 --> 43:34.080
<i>but, well, you know Andrew.</i>

43:34.080 --> 43:35.480
<i>Drew a complete blank.</i>

43:37.120 --> 43:39.440
So if her intention was
to set tongues wagging,

43:39.440 --> 43:41.120
she's certainly succeeded.

43:44.040 --> 43:46.040
Don't give it any further thought.

43:46.840 --> 43:47.680
<i>Yes.</i>

43:48.480 --> 43:50.040
Just think about the boys.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.240
Thank you, darling.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.600
[receiver clatters]

44:04.560 --> 44:06.560
[lilting instrumental music ends]

44:12.800 --> 44:13.640
Here.

44:17.240 --> 44:18.240
Dinner was weird.

44:21.120 --> 44:21.960
Yeah.

44:24.640 --> 44:26.720
When he overcompensates like that...

44:28.040 --> 44:30.720
"This can be
an exciting new chapter for us all."

44:32.240 --> 44:33.800
Barf. [exhales]

44:33.800 --> 44:36.680
A few years ago,
it would have pissed me off.

44:37.800 --> 44:38.920
Now I just don't care.

44:44.520 --> 44:47.280
I heard Granny's going to
make a speech at the wedding.

44:47.920 --> 44:49.840
Would you like to know what else I heard?

44:53.000 --> 44:57.040
That she's going to use the occasion
to tell the family she's standing down.

44:57.040 --> 44:59.600
- After 50 years in the job.
- She'd never do that.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.520
And even if she did, why on Pa's big day?

45:02.520 --> 45:04.960
Because it's the wedding present
he most wants?

45:08.000 --> 45:10.200
- He does want it, doesn't he?
- Craves it.

45:10.200 --> 45:11.760
[both scoff softly]

45:12.360 --> 45:13.880
For him and for Camilla.

45:18.080 --> 45:20.000
If she did, know what else it would mean?

45:21.720 --> 45:22.960
It would be you next.

45:24.040 --> 45:25.680
That'd make you William the...

45:25.680 --> 45:26.600
Fifth.

45:27.520 --> 45:28.400
Better than Second.

45:29.280 --> 45:32.560
- He was assassinated by his brother.
- [chuckles] Was he?

45:32.560 --> 45:35.840
Who, would you believe,
was also called Prince Harry.

45:36.400 --> 45:38.720
He had William killed
in a shooting "accident,"

45:38.720 --> 45:42.080
then galloped off to Winchester
to claim the throne for himself.

45:42.080 --> 45:44.080
[both chuckling softly]

45:44.080 --> 45:46.880
Don't worry, mate.
I wouldn't do that to you.

45:57.040 --> 45:59.040
[light instrumental music builds slowly]

45:59.040 --> 46:01.120
[indistinct overlapping chatter]

46:01.120 --> 46:02.240
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:06.640 --> 46:07.800
Good spot for it.

46:38.680 --> 46:39.760
And a white one.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.520
For the boys.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.320
[lively overlapping chatter]

47:21.480 --> 47:22.480

Yeah.

Bye.

presented to Her Majesty in 1978.</i>

48:12.040 --> 48:14.440
I don't know what you think you're doing.

48:14.960 --> 48:17.040
[Elizabeth] I'm doing the sensible thing.

48:17.040 --> 48:18.400
The responsible thing.

48:19.240 --> 48:24.000
If we're not careful,
if I go on another 20, 25 years,

48:24.000 --> 48:26.560
a tired, white-haired geriatric queen

48:26.560 --> 48:30.320
will hand over to a tired,
white-haired geriatric Prince of Wales.

48:30.320 --> 48:31.360
Those are the rules.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.560
But if he were then to go on
another 20, 25 years,

48:36.160 --> 48:38.880
it would mean
that for the next half century,

48:38.880 --> 48:42.120
the British monarchy would be
a very decrepit experience indeed.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.000
Is that the right thing
to do to the institution?

48:45.520 --> 48:47.880
Charles is in the prime of his life now.

48:48.400 --> 48:50.720
Honestly, I've never heard
so much nonsense.

48:50.720 --> 48:53.760
Have you forgotten the oath that you took?
I declare...

48:53.760 --> 48:55.760
...before you all that my whole life,

48:55.760 --> 48:59.760
whether it be long or short,
shall be devoted to your service.

48:59.760 --> 49:03.280
You're fit enough to ride and drive.
You're fit enough to wear the crown.

49:04.040 --> 49:06.280
You remember what Queen Mary told you.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.360
- Another geriatric.
- [door opens]

49:10.360 --> 49:12.200
[lilting instrumental music plays]

49:12.200 --> 49:15.080
Monarchy is something you are,
not what you do.

49:15.080 --> 49:17.200
The Crown is a symbol of permanence.

49:17.200 --> 49:19.440
Of stability. Of continuity.

49:19.440 --> 49:24.160
If you step down, you will be symbolizing
instability and impermanence.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.480
You'll also be indicating
the luxury of choice,

49:28.480 --> 49:30.440
which is the one thing we cannot have

49:30.440 --> 49:32.840
if we claim the Crown is
also our birthright.

49:32.840 --> 49:36.120
So you would have
a superannuated old lady running the show

49:36.120 --> 49:38.920
while a fit,
energetic Prince of Wales watches on,

49:38.920 --> 49:40.720
straining at the leash.

49:40.720 --> 49:43.200
[young Elizabeth]
But I don't see you as decrepit.

49:43.200 --> 49:46.920
Since the jubilee, since Mummy's death,
I see you as liberated.

49:48.520 --> 49:49.520
Confident.

49:50.600 --> 49:52.520
You say that Charles is in his prime.

49:52.520 --> 49:55.960
Well, I see you in yours.

49:59.000 --> 49:59.960
And admit it.

50:01.720 --> 50:06.400
You sometimes think there's a difference
between you and the rest of the family.

50:09.320 --> 50:10.280
Yes.

50:11.800 --> 50:13.400
It comes naturally to you.

50:15.880 --> 50:18.080
They all seem to make such a mess of it.

50:18.800 --> 50:20.040
I didn't say that.

50:23.080 --> 50:24.640
No, but you've thought it.

50:24.640 --> 50:25.600
Privately.

50:27.520 --> 50:28.760
And with good reason.

50:31.360 --> 50:34.600
This system is
a dreadful thing to inflict upon people.

50:36.120 --> 50:37.120
It's not natural.

50:38.040 --> 50:39.040
It's not fair.

50:40.200 --> 50:41.200
It's not kind.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.840
But you seem to thrive in it.

50:46.600 --> 50:50.400
And, more importantly,
it seems to thrive under you.

50:52.640 --> 50:56.440
So, shouldn't you stay
for every single day that you can?

51:01.280 --> 51:03.640
But what about the life I put aside?

51:03.640 --> 51:05.720
[melancholy music builds slowly]

51:07.120 --> 51:09.200
The woman I put aside

51:10.600 --> 51:12.040
when I became Queen.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.240
What sort of question is that?

51:19.480 --> 51:20.520
For years now,

51:20.520 --> 51:22.920
there has been just one Elizabeth.

51:25.160 --> 51:26.160
Queen Elizabeth.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.680
If you went looking for Elizabeth Windsor,

51:33.840 --> 51:35.160
you wouldn't find her.

51:37.360 --> 51:38.360
She's gone.

51:40.560 --> 51:41.520
Long gone.

51:44.240 --> 51:45.760
You buried her years ago.

The Grand National steeplechase

55:55.840 --> 55:59.440

56:02.880 --> 56:05.200

to the wedding of another Prince of Wales,

56:40.440 --> 56:42.280
Edward, the Black Prince.

56:43.320 --> 56:46.880
The young Edward was widely expected
to marry a European princess,

56:46.880 --> 56:48.520
but Edward had other ideas.

Being Prince of Wales is hardly
a recipe for happiness.

57:19.680 --> 57:21.360
History has taught us that.

To be condemned to watch an old parent

57:24.640 --> 57:29.720
do a job one can imagine oneself
doing better, for years and years...

[laughter rises and fades]

57:31.800 --> 57:36.800

that you have filled this vacuum

57:36.800 --> 57:39.560
not, like several predecessors,

57:39.560 --> 57:42.520

Be kind to him.

59:33.600 --> 59:37.160
In many ways, it's harder
being number two than number one.

59:37.960 --> 59:40.280
The system protects number one.

Number two tends to...

"need extra care and attention."

Still, it defines the Crown.

01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:15.120
There you are.

01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.120
[Elizabeth] Yes.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.200
Here I still am.

01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:20.240
[Philip chuckles]

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:25.960
Good day, I think.

01:02:25.960 --> 01:02:27.280
Oh yes.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.280
I had the winner
on three of the four races at Aintree.

01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:32.120
How are you planning on celebrating?

01:02:32.120 --> 01:02:33.880
Ooh, night on the town?

01:02:34.560 --> 01:02:36.800
- Joyriding? Ram-raiding?
- [Philip chuckles]

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:40.000
Give Chief Constable Dedds
something to worry about after all.

01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:42.240
Well done with the speech.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.880
- Thank you.
- It was funny.

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:46.280
Don't sound so surprised.

01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:49.840
And not a hint of the torment
you've been going through.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.960
Was it that obvious?

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.880
Yes.

01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:56.240
But the right decision has been made.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:02.080
You will continue as Queen for as long as
you possibly can, for one reason.

01:03:02.080 --> 01:03:04.480
- Because those are the rules.
- No.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.400
Because those that come after you
are not remotely ready to take over.

01:03:10.480 --> 01:03:13.400
No, but I wasn't either.
Remember? I was so young.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:16.320
Ah, no, no. You were always ready.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.320
You were born ready.

01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.280
You are one of a kind.

01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.080
By contrast, this lot...

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.720
Mmm?

01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.640
The good thing is, it's not our problem.

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.880
This is where we will be, you and I.

01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:38.120
Right under this stone.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.160
We'll never hear the screams
from inside there.

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.080
Philip.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.440
What?

01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.240
You know I'm right.

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.600
The system makes no sense anymore
to those outside it,

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.600
nor to those of us <i>inside</i> it.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:03:59.840
[breathes deeply]

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:02.680
<i>All human things are subject to decay</i>

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.040
<i>And when fate summons</i>

01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:07.920
<i>Even monarchs must obey</i>

01:04:12.440 --> 01:04:14.280
We're a dying breed, you and I.

01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:20.480
Oh, I'm sure everyone will carry on,
pretending all is well.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.280
But the party's over.

01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.360
The good news is,

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:32.800
that while Rome burns
and the temple falls,

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.600
we will sleep, dearie, sleep.

01:04:38.440 --> 01:04:39.640
Oh!

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:41.000
You looked.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.320
[chuckles] Yes.

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:45.400
A piper's lament.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.720
Your sole musical choice.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200
It's very you.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.480
And your coffin being driven
in an old Land Rover is very you.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:58.720
Oh!

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.680
- You looked.
- I did.

01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.600
Well...

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.240
I'll leave you to it.

01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.760
Say one for me?

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:34.080
["Sleep Dearie Sleep" playing on bagpipes]

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.360
[regal instrumental music joins bagpipes]

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.800
[regal music swells]

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.680
[bagpipes rise]

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:18.840
[closing chord rises and falls]

01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.880
[gentle instrumental music plays]
