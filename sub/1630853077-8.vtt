WEBVTT

01:03.689 --> 01:07.025
Hello, and shalom,
and thank you for coming.

01:07.109 --> 01:10.779
If you're watching this, well,
you probably know who I am.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.658
For those of you just tuning in,
my name is Adam Neumann.

01:14.741 --> 01:17.119
And I am many things.

01:17.202 --> 01:20.789
Immigrant, entrepreneur, husband,
father, disrupter, maverick,

01:20.873 --> 01:25.043
creator, and founder and CEO
of The We Company,

01:25.127 --> 01:29.214
the third most valuable private company
in the world.

01:30.465 --> 01:33.719
I could give you my version
of how we got here,

01:33.802 --> 01:36.388
but that is the past.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.433
And I am more interested in the future.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.311
So come with me. Come with me.

01:42.394 --> 01:46.315
It is time for the We revolution.

01:56.700 --> 01:57.534
Line.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.705
These are the new talking points.
Stick to them.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.831
Hang up the phone.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.291
Don't say anything but new talking points.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.459
Hang up the phone, Cindy!

02:05.542 --> 02:07.419
- Hang up the phone!
- God dammit!

02:07.503 --> 02:09.795
Just tell them we'll call them back later.
Do not comment.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.423
- What?
-<i>Wall Street Journal</i>.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.842
It is our S-1. We're very proud of it.
I have to go now. Thank you.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.679
This is Damian.

02:18.680 --> 02:20.807
No, I don't have a comment on the S-1.
It speaks for itself.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.267
Oh, my God. Hand me napkins.

02:22.351 --> 02:24.561
- Cereal-- What cereal box?
- Hi.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.563
- No, he's not. We're aware.
- Okay.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.315
What about a cereal box?

02:33.946 --> 02:35.113
Why are you here?

02:37.533 --> 02:38.909
To-- To--

02:40.035 --> 02:41.787
To talk about the S-1.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.583
It's perfect, is it not?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.293
I mean, we think it's perfect.

02:48.377 --> 02:51.129
- Yeah. We love it.
- Absolutely, so…

02:54.007 --> 02:58.178
So, what are they saying?

02:58.262 --> 03:00.764
There's the-- the losses.

03:00.848 --> 03:04.977
And then there's the-- the pictures.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.687
- Pictures?
- People are upset about the pictures?

03:06.770 --> 03:07.980
- Pictures gave it life.
- I know.

03:08.063 --> 03:10.899
I know. It's silly, but it's--

03:10.983 --> 03:14.027
Some people think an-- an S-1

03:14.111 --> 03:16.822
shouldn't traditionally have
photo spreads--

03:16.905 --> 03:18.532
- That's why it's in there.
- Exactly!

03:18.615 --> 03:19.616
That's why we did it.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.703
Take it away.

03:23.287 --> 03:28.250
The real estate industry is currently
experiencing…

03:28.959 --> 03:32.796
The real estate industry
is currently experiencing a…

03:34.006 --> 03:36.425
paradigm shift from a…

03:37.092 --> 03:41.180
Paradigm shift from a…

03:44.558 --> 03:46.476
Fuck!

03:46.560 --> 03:50.480
Guys, it's a financial document
that no one reads.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.399
Well, they do read
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>,

03:52.482 --> 03:53.775
and they're working on a story.

03:53.859 --> 03:56.653
- What do you mean?
- What story? There's no story.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.031
Yeah, I mean, late-night parties,
tequila shots,

03:59.114 --> 04:01.742
and a brick of weed in a cereal box

04:01.825 --> 04:03.243
- on an international flight.
- It's a cube.

04:03.327 --> 04:04.786
It was not-- It was a cube.

04:04.870 --> 04:08.123
Oh, my fucking God!
<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>?

04:08.207 --> 04:11.043
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
- I'm out of here.

04:11.126 --> 04:14.254
- You can't let them run that story.
- Right.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.632
No, Damian,
you can't let them run that story!

04:16.714 --> 04:17.716
Sorry.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.426
You can't run the story.

04:20.469 --> 04:23.096
Because it's a non-story, Eliot.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.058
No, investors are not losing confidence
in the IPO.

04:26.808 --> 04:30.312
Investors are losing confidence
in the IPO.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.482
We need to postpone it.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.108
No, no, no.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.862
No, no, we're not going to postpone.
We're not postponing, Jamie.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.366
If we don't postpone,
we have to lower the valuation.

04:43.659 --> 04:44.660
By how much?

04:45.327 --> 04:46.411
Closer to 20.

04:46.495 --> 04:50.290
You want to lower the valuation
by $27 billion?

04:50.374 --> 04:53.919
Jamie, do you know what causes
investors to lose confidence?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.462
That. That does.

04:55.546 --> 04:58.507
It's a tough time to be a unicorn.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.551
There's a lot of scrutiny out there.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.096
Uber, Lyft, Peloton, Slack,
they're all underperforming post-IPO.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.597
All of them.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.393
The "unicorn stampede."
It has become a bloodbath.

05:09.476 --> 05:14.022
<i>And so, to kind of illustrate this point,
we recently saw, just last week</i>

05:14.106 --> 05:16.108
<i>an issue with WeWork,</i>

05:16.191 --> 05:19.820
<i>where WeWork was making this
transition from the private markets,</i>

05:19.903 --> 05:23.240
<i>trying to get ready for an IPO
to the public market,</i>

05:23.323 --> 05:28.453
<i>and they had raised
on a previous valuation of $47 billion.</i>

05:28.537 --> 05:33.166
<i>They just decided overnight,
"Just kidding, we're worth 20 billion."</i>

05:33.250 --> 05:35.878
<i>And so, if you invested in WeWork,</i>

05:35.961 --> 05:37.880
<i>thinking that it had a valuation
of 47 billion…</i>

05:37.963 --> 05:39.256
<i>Your time has expired.</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:40.883
<i>…you're getting fleeced.</i>

05:42.593 --> 05:44.344
I donated to her campaign.

05:44.428 --> 05:47.055
Fuck her. She's a fucking socialist.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.892
She is misrepresenting
the private markets.

05:49.975 --> 05:52.060
You're dealing
with very sophisticated investors.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.272
Could you stop sending me
the daily press briefings?

05:55.355 --> 05:57.399
They're just--
All of the mentions are bad,

05:57.482 --> 06:00.652
and I'm starting
to let negative thoughts in and…

06:02.905 --> 06:03.906
Let's go.

06:04.489 --> 06:06.408
Why do they hate us so much?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.579
All we wanted to do was save the world.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.165
We got this. Damian!

06:13.248 --> 06:15.501
We got it. We got it, Damian! Got it.

06:15.584 --> 06:19.087
There's a lot of noise back there.
I think we need to simmer it down.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.672
Calm it down. Find your spot.

06:20.756 --> 06:23.425
- Fungible. Ible…
- Okay. It's so good. It's so good.

06:23.509 --> 06:25.302
- Is it?
- That is such a hard line.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.805
Commodities and…
You're getting a little tight in here.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.973
So why don't we just--

06:32.809 --> 06:36.104
Say this with me. A proper pot of coffee
in a proper coffee pot.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.691
A proper cot of-- A proper
pot of coffee in a p--

06:39.775 --> 06:41.235
- Yes.
- A proper pot of coffee

06:41.318 --> 06:42.819
in a proper coffee pot.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.322
A proper coppet potty
in a proper coppy pot.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.281
- I got it.
- Okay. Great.

06:46.365 --> 06:48.534
- A proper copper potty--
- Esther.

06:49.034 --> 06:51.286
Proper pot of coffee
in a proper coffee pot.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.413
Let it loose. And…

06:53.497 --> 06:54.498
Action.

06:54.581 --> 06:56.583
It's bad, Adam. It's bad.

06:56.667 --> 06:59.962
It's a bit of bad press over
a silly financial document.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.046
It will blow over.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.257
Listen, you had a hell of an idea
for a business,

07:03.340 --> 07:07.553
you built it into something that
far exceeded my wildest expectations,

07:07.636 --> 07:11.682
and now you're gonna fuck it all up
over all this nonsense?

07:12.474 --> 07:14.434
What are you talking about
"nonsense," Bruce?

07:14.518 --> 07:16.520
- Nonsense?
- The succession plan.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.939
What about the succession plan?

07:19.022 --> 07:20.732
Rebekah gets to choose your successor?

07:20.816 --> 07:24.152
This is about to be a public company.
Not a monarchy.

07:24.236 --> 07:27.781
But it is.
It is like a monarchy, okay.

07:27.865 --> 07:31.368
My family is the moral compass
of this company.

07:31.451 --> 07:35.706
See? You have to stop
saying things like that.

07:35.789 --> 07:39.751
I am now begging you. Please, please.

07:42.421 --> 07:44.548
What if I give you something else?
Give me 24 hours.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.676
Benchmark invested 16.5 million in WeWork,

07:47.759 --> 07:50.721
and you've already cashed out
over 300 million worth of shares.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.682
You've made 20 times your investment,
and, and,

07:53.765 --> 07:55.893
you'll make another billion from the IPO.

07:55.976 --> 08:00.063
So don't talk to me about nonsense, Bruce.
My nonsense has made you a fortune.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.358
We just need to get in front
of the investors.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.527
The road show, it starts next week.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.780
And for the ones who can't meet me
in person, we're making a video.

08:08.864 --> 08:12.284
We're bringing in the crew from Hollywood.
We've spared no expense.

08:12.367 --> 08:16.538
And trust me when I say this, trust me,
I will bring my A-game.

08:19.958 --> 08:20.959
Okay.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.798
Okay. Okay.

08:28.050 --> 08:29.092
This is it.

08:29.176 --> 08:32.386
I am committed to building not just
a good business,

08:32.471 --> 08:34.389
- but a great company.
- What?

08:34.472 --> 08:36.350
- And I promise, in my decisions…
- They're running it.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.602
-…I will remain loyal to whatever is--
- Shit.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.604
Again.

08:40.687 --> 08:41.855
You got it.

08:42.648 --> 08:46.443
I am committed to building not just
a good business, but a great company.

08:46.527 --> 08:47.528
And I promise

08:47.611 --> 08:50.155
that in my decisions, I will remain loyal

08:50.239 --> 08:53.951
to whatever is best in the long term
for the greater We.

08:55.077 --> 08:57.538
Our employees, our members, our partners,

08:57.621 --> 09:02.376
our investors
and, most importantly, our planet.

09:02.876 --> 09:08.048
So come with me,
and let's build the future together.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.299
Good.

09:10.676 --> 09:13.637
- Good? Good? Great?
- Yeah, great actually.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.888
- Great.
- I heard a "great."

09:14.972 --> 09:16.223
- That was great.
- Esther?

09:16.306 --> 09:18.725
- It was great. You did it. You did it.
- I heard a "great."

09:18.809 --> 09:21.186
- You did it. You manifested it.
- Did you have any doubt?

09:21.270 --> 09:23.355
- No, didn't have any doubt.
- No, no, you had no doubt.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.648
- Nothing.
- Okay.

09:24.731 --> 09:25.941
You manifested it.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.026
Damian, how was it?

09:29.570 --> 09:32.155
Damian, my PR guru, how was it? Okay?

09:32.865 --> 09:34.283
I think we're finished.

09:35.242 --> 09:39.496
- Hey, yes!
- Okay.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.249
- Are you gonna tell them?
- Fuck no.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.917
- Thank you all…
- Where are you going?

09:44.001 --> 09:46.044
Back to the style section.

09:55.679 --> 09:58.599
He's a goddamn punch line.
"Neumann is known for making claims

09:58.682 --> 10:01.059
such as becoming the world's
first trillionaire,

10:01.143 --> 10:04.104
becoming president of the world,
and living forever."

10:04.188 --> 10:06.190
Sounds like a maniac.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.274
It's humiliating.

10:07.357 --> 10:08.817
He will never survive this.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.736
Survive it? No, he's dead already.

10:10.819 --> 10:15.157
No, I am talking about us.
This is humiliating for us.

10:15.240 --> 10:19.453
Bruce, he's gotta go. Partying has
long been a feature of his work life…

10:19.536 --> 10:20.954
…maniac.

10:21.038 --> 10:22.539
The guy's a nut job…

10:29.213 --> 10:32.925
All those in favor,
please signify by saying, "Aye."

10:33.008 --> 10:34.009
Aye.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.518
Call his office and get him down here.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.186
Yes, I understand it's urgent.

10:53.070 --> 10:54.404
Good morning!

11:21.265 --> 11:22.516
Okay.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.574
'Cause we are going to IPO in two weeks.

11:39.575 --> 11:42.619
Adam, an IPO is out of the question.

11:43.287 --> 11:44.830
I don't accept that.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.540
- Adam.
- I don't accept it.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.250
- And furthermore…
- Adam. Adam.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.835
…I don't believe
you have the faith in me--

11:49.918 --> 11:51.086
Adam.

11:52.087 --> 11:53.922
The board voted this morning.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.508
We want you out.

11:58.927 --> 11:59.970
<i>Call the lawyers.</i>

12:00.053 --> 12:01.805
Yeah. Which one?

12:01.889 --> 12:02.973
All of them.

12:14.735 --> 12:15.652
Oh, thank you.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.867
Well,

12:21.950 --> 12:25.537
I have no idea how you got your investors
to agree to this,

12:25.621 --> 12:31.668
but your "supervoting" shares
give you 20 votes on each share.

12:32.252 --> 12:36.298
You basically control 65% of the vote
on any corporate matter.

12:36.381 --> 12:40.844
So you're right, they can't fire you.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.513
- Good.
- Great.

12:42.596 --> 12:43.680
Now we fire them.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.767
Which ones?

12:47.351 --> 12:49.895
Every single person on the board.

12:53.649 --> 12:55.567
Robb, why don't you take this?

13:01.365 --> 13:04.576
Legally, yes, you could fire them.

13:04.660 --> 13:08.580
But you do need a board of directors.

13:09.665 --> 13:10.666
Why?

13:10.749 --> 13:12.417
It's required by state law.

13:14.586 --> 13:15.963
The question is…

13:18.131 --> 13:19.925
can we change the law?

13:24.596 --> 13:26.723
That might take a while.

13:30.352 --> 13:31.353
Okay--

13:31.979 --> 13:35.148
We can appoint anyone
we want to the board, correct?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.985
Who we like, who we trust, who we can--

13:38.068 --> 13:41.071
-…we feel has the right energy.
- Yes. Yes, yes.

13:42.072 --> 13:43.866
Jen, Matthew?

13:44.825 --> 13:47.286
Birdie. Phil.

13:47.369 --> 13:48.495
- Unfortunately…
- Yes.

13:48.579 --> 13:52.374
…the NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges
require them to be independent.

13:54.251 --> 13:58.172
Legally, the board is meant to provide
experience and advice.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.339
God.

14:00.465 --> 14:03.969
Okay, so what about

14:05.095 --> 14:06.138
Elon?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.056
Well--

14:08.140 --> 14:09.600
Elon.

14:09.683 --> 14:13.604
Elon's a peer, right? So he can't
tell you anything you don't already know.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.063
- I think--
- True.

14:15.147 --> 14:18.483
I think Warren. Or Bill.

14:18.567 --> 14:19.610
Obama.

14:20.569 --> 14:22.946
Barack's great,
but he's not a businessman.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.909
If you try to fire the board,

14:26.992 --> 14:29.036
you're looking at a lengthy legal fight.

14:29.119 --> 14:33.957
And based on what you've told us,
that's time you don't have.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.919
Look, you don't have a legal problem.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.338
You have an image problem.

14:40.088 --> 14:45.052
The public markets want a steady hand
at the wheel.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.096
Not a rock star.

14:49.431 --> 14:51.558
Okay, you're talking about gravitas.

14:51.642 --> 14:52.768
- Exactly.
- Okay.

14:52.851 --> 14:56.230
Show them
that you can run a public company.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.818
Gravitas. Gravitas.

15:01.902 --> 15:02.903
Perfect.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.699
Where's Adam?

15:08.325 --> 15:09.910
The natives are getting restless.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.828
Dude, what-- Nobody uses
that expression anymore.

15:11.912 --> 15:14.456
Well, we need to say something to them.

15:17.751 --> 15:20.504
- Me?
- You're the co-founder of the company.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.839
Yeah, dude, you got this.

15:21.922 --> 15:23.924
- You're gonna be great.
- They're scared. Speak to that fear.

15:24.007 --> 15:25.759
- Okay.
- They know your face.

15:25.843 --> 15:27.594
- Use your height.
- Tell them everything's cool.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.513
- Everything's gonna be taken care of.
- Everything's okay.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.266
- Easy.
- Loose. Loose, loose, loose.

15:32.349 --> 15:33.392
It's okay.

15:34.852 --> 15:36.562
Everyone.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.523
Excuse me, everyone.

15:40.482 --> 15:41.775
Excuse me, everyone!

15:45.487 --> 15:46.613
Hey--

15:48.490 --> 15:49.741
Excuse me, everyone.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.119
Please, guys.

15:53.537 --> 15:55.289
Guys-- Sorry.

15:55.372 --> 15:57.332
Hey-- Hi, everyone.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.044
Happy Monday.

16:01.128 --> 16:05.966
Good morning. TGIM, right?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.093
Is Adam fired?

16:09.052 --> 16:10.095
What? No.

16:10.971 --> 16:13.724
Everything--
Everything's under control.

16:13.807 --> 16:15.225
What about the IPO?

16:15.309 --> 16:16.852
What happens with our stock options?

16:16.935 --> 16:18.353
Are we getting fired?

16:18.437 --> 16:21.106
No, no one is getting fired yet.

16:21.190 --> 16:22.983
- Yet?
- What does that mean?

16:23.650 --> 16:26.945
No. Guys, listen.
Hey, hey, hey, everyone.

16:28.280 --> 16:32.701
Look, I know you're all looking
for a little reassurance right now.

16:33.243 --> 16:36.079
And you deserve that. So…

16:37.664 --> 16:39.666
There's a few things I can say.

16:39.750 --> 16:43.003
It's every--

16:44.630 --> 16:46.298
<i>Every little thing…</i>

16:47.591 --> 16:51.762
<i>Every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

16:53.889 --> 16:56.099
<i>I said don't worry</i>

16:57.476 --> 16:58.894
<i>About a thing</i>

17:01.230 --> 17:05.150
<i>'Cause every little thing
Is gonna be all right</i>

17:06.568 --> 17:08.028
<i>Said don't worry--</i>

17:08.111 --> 17:10.531
Oh, thank God. Adam's here.

17:16.328 --> 17:17.329
Adam, everyone.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.085
Colleagues,

17:24.670 --> 17:28.257
friends and family.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.177
This is a pivotal moment.

17:33.178 --> 17:37.558
And I am so proud, so very grateful
to have you all gathered here today.

17:43.814 --> 17:45.899
There's a lot of noise out there.

17:47.818 --> 17:51.363
A lot of gossip, a lot of talk.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.448
About me.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.743
About us.

17:58.829 --> 18:03.292
Because that is what people do
when they're afraid.

18:04.042 --> 18:06.712
Do you understand what we have all done?

18:07.921 --> 18:10.757
Do you understand? We--

18:10.841 --> 18:13.051
We poked the bear.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.845
We poked that bear.

18:14.928 --> 18:18.765
We disrupted a trillion-dollar industry.

18:18.849 --> 18:23.645
And we will emerge stronger
and more fearless and more revolutionary

18:23.729 --> 18:25.439
than ever before!

18:26.315 --> 18:27.524
Yes!

18:27.608 --> 18:30.527
More dedicated, and even more committed.

18:31.153 --> 18:35.532
Committed to our mission
to elevate the world's consciousness!

18:36.200 --> 18:37.201
Thank you, Rivka.

18:37.284 --> 18:42.873
And I, I will never not be
the CEO of WeWork!

18:48.712 --> 18:49.963
Yeah…

18:51.715 --> 18:54.259
- When I say "We," you say…
- Work.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.511
- We!
- Work.

18:55.594 --> 18:57.012
Step down.

19:00.557 --> 19:01.683
Who said that?

19:05.437 --> 19:06.438
Who was it?

19:09.316 --> 19:10.442
How dare you?

19:15.989 --> 19:17.533
It's okay. It's okay.

19:23.705 --> 19:24.831
<i>You've lost them.</i>

19:24.915 --> 19:28.252
Your interests and the interests
of your employees have diverged.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.797
No, I don't believe that. I-I just--
They're-- They're just scared.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.508
No. They're angry.

19:35.425 --> 19:40.472
They've spent two years, five years,
a decade toiling away for low wages,

19:40.556 --> 19:42.724
for an IPO payday that now may never come.

19:42.808 --> 19:44.685
- No. It's coming. Coming.
- I mean--

19:44.768 --> 19:46.687
- They will feel used…
- It's coming.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.730
…and they will blame you.

19:48.814 --> 19:51.608
Where do you think <i>The Wall Street
Journal</i> got its information?

19:52.401 --> 19:54.486
The unnamed sources?

19:56.196 --> 19:57.281
There they are.

19:58.740 --> 19:59.992
You're at war.

20:00.993 --> 20:04.329
It'll be fought on multiple fronts.
In the boardroom, in the press.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.541
Even here in the halls
of your own company.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.294
Trust no one.

20:10.377 --> 20:13.881
Sorry, are we in a John Grisham novel?

20:13.964 --> 20:17.384
You're paying me to be dramatic.
That's why it's called crisis PR.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.970
You have to understand, Rebekah,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.806
you and Adam, you are not people.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.768
- We're not people?
- No. You're products.

20:26.852 --> 20:30.189
The media sold you to the public once
as unicorns,

20:30.731 --> 20:32.524
now they'll sell you again as villains.

20:32.608 --> 20:36.111
Okay, so obviously we need to reframe it.

20:36.195 --> 20:39.489
We need to take control of it.
So why don't you put us on CNBC?

20:39.573 --> 20:40.574
- Good idea.
- No.

20:40.657 --> 20:42.159
- I think it's the--
- No, no.

20:42.242 --> 20:45.829
They're making this into a circus.
Let's not help them.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.457
Stay in the foxhole.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.919
I'll say it again, we are at war.

20:52.461 --> 20:55.255
And these are your foot soldiers.

20:56.006 --> 20:58.509
God help the enemy,
'cause they're a bunch of freaks.

20:59.009 --> 21:01.595
They don't look like much,
but when I pump them full of Adderall

21:01.678 --> 21:04.473
and turn these sickos loose, watch out.

21:06.225 --> 21:08.769
You should both have your offices
swept for bugs.

21:09.311 --> 21:10.437
Bugs?

21:11.271 --> 21:15.108
We must be vigilant.
Methodical. Strategic.

21:15.943 --> 21:18.237
No emails, no texts,

21:18.820 --> 21:20.697
no phone calls that might be overheard.

21:20.781 --> 21:23.909
No false moves. Got it?

21:26.453 --> 21:27.496
Adam?

21:34.044 --> 21:36.338
You want war? I'll give you war.

21:36.421 --> 21:39.007
Okay. I'll give you war!

21:43.887 --> 21:45.556
We're going to war!

21:45.639 --> 21:47.015
To war, you understand?

21:47.099 --> 21:47.933
- Phil.
- Yeah?

21:48.016 --> 21:49.935
- Pack it up. Pack it all up.
- Okay. I'll go--

21:50.018 --> 21:52.229
Don't forget the whiteboard, understand?
Don't forget it.

21:52.312 --> 21:54.439
- Okay.
- Adam. Adam!

21:54.523 --> 21:56.149
Go, go.

21:56.817 --> 21:58.861
Coming through. Push, Phil, push.

21:58.944 --> 22:00.654
- Pushing.
- Push.

22:01.196 --> 22:03.824
- Out the way.
- Adam. Adam.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.702
This is proprietary,
you understand?

22:06.785 --> 22:09.037
- If I see this anywhere, anywhere…
- Let's catch the light.

22:09.121 --> 22:11.248
…I'll be forced to take legal action,
you understand? Phil.

22:11.331 --> 22:13.876
- Get his picture. Take his information.
- Whoa, whoa-- No, fuck off.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.043
Get his picture.

22:15.127 --> 22:17.337
- Rivka, cover the board, cover the board.
- I'm just trying to move--

22:17.421 --> 22:19.298
- Cover the board.
- I'm covering the board.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.176
Let's just get it to the house, okay?
Okay. Do you have it?

22:22.259 --> 22:23.385
- Yeah.
- We got it, we got it.

22:23.468 --> 22:25.721
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay.

22:25.804 --> 22:26.805
Okay.

22:27.806 --> 22:28.807
It's okay--

22:28.891 --> 22:31.685
Please, please don't lean
the whiteboards against the wall.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.771
I'm gonna need to ask everyone
to wear booties.

22:34.855 --> 22:36.481
Ingrid? Ingrid.

22:36.565 --> 22:38.775
I think we might need to send
the kids to the Hamptons.

22:38.859 --> 22:42.696
All right, all right. Mommy loves you.
Claudia, Claudia, did you get the booties?

22:42.779 --> 22:46.700
Hello? Yeah, no, I'm sorry,
we just can't comment.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.786
Let me look into that
and circle back to you.

22:49.870 --> 22:52.998
No, no, no.

22:53.081 --> 22:57.127
- Not "circle back." You understand?
- This couch is hand-loomed linen,

22:57.211 --> 22:59.379
so I'm gonna need to put towels under you.

22:59.463 --> 23:00.631
Oh, my God.

23:01.340 --> 23:03.133
- Angela. Can you get the towels?
- Hello?

23:03.217 --> 23:05.844
No, we're not commenting
on that at this time.

23:05.928 --> 23:07.888
Nope, not commenting. No comment.

23:07.971 --> 23:10.474
I'm not gonna comment at this time.

23:11.183 --> 23:12.976
Comment. Please, please, comment.

23:13.060 --> 23:16.813
Comment. Comment. Just dig in. Comment.

23:16.897 --> 23:19.316
This, thi-- This is war. This?

23:19.942 --> 23:22.903
My seven-year-old could answer
the phones and say, "no comment"

23:22.986 --> 23:25.280
with more enthusiasm than this.

23:25.364 --> 23:26.365
Please!

23:26.448 --> 23:29.284
Adam, be respectful.
I'm s-- I'm just gonna…

23:29.368 --> 23:30.702
They're the best in the business.

23:30.786 --> 23:34.540
The best-- Well, must not be a very
competitive industry, I have to say.

23:34.623 --> 23:36.583
You could try again in a week.

23:37.167 --> 23:39.253
Again, no comment.

23:40.546 --> 23:42.047
I really have no--

23:42.130 --> 23:43.465
Pardon me.

23:44.591 --> 23:46.760
- Pardon me. Pardon.
- Let me call you back.

23:47.719 --> 23:49.972
- What is your name?
- Chris.

23:50.055 --> 23:53.642
Chris, no more "no comment,"
you understand?

23:53.725 --> 23:54.935
No more "no comment."

23:55.018 --> 23:57.354
I'm not paying you guys
a million dollars an hour

23:57.437 --> 23:59.648
or whatever it is for "no comment."

24:00.816 --> 24:06.780
If someone calls and asks about tequila,
I want you to ask them,

24:06.864 --> 24:09.741
"You ever go to an office party
or go out for work drinks?

24:09.825 --> 24:11.827
Ever heard of a three-martini lunch?"

24:11.910 --> 24:15.706
Booze has always been a part of business.
You understand?

24:15.789 --> 24:18.000
- You agree. You agree. Thank you.
- Adam.

24:18.083 --> 24:19.251
Thank you very much. No.

24:19.334 --> 24:21.211
- Let's take a break. Honey, let's--
- One moment.

24:21.295 --> 24:25.132
I'm just making a point.
Making a point. Please.

24:25.215 --> 24:30.012
And if they happen to mention
the-the-the trillionaire crap, okay?

24:30.095 --> 24:32.973
I want you to say to them,
"Well, pardon me,

24:33.056 --> 24:35.809
but what is the headline here?

24:36.643 --> 24:39.813
Immigrant entrepreneur
dares to dream too big?"

24:40.814 --> 24:45.027
And if-- if they dare to mention my wife,

24:46.111 --> 24:49.573
you say nothing,
and you put me on the phone.

24:49.656 --> 24:52.034
- You understand? Put me on the phone.
- Adam. It's fine.

24:52.117 --> 24:54.411
And then I'll give a comment.

24:54.494 --> 24:56.538
You're not paying us to fight back.

24:56.622 --> 24:58.332
Then what am I paying you for?

24:58.415 --> 25:00.667
- To deflect. To defuse.
- Please, to-- and?

25:00.751 --> 25:03.212
- Thank you.
- To grind them down with non-answers.

25:03.295 --> 25:04.880
- To be boring.
- It's okay, Adam.

25:04.963 --> 25:08.592
Well, they are definitely
the best in the business at that.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.553
- Thank you very much.
- You are paying us to stop the bleeding.

25:11.637 --> 25:13.555
- We know. Thank you.
- So let us do our jobs.

25:13.639 --> 25:15.766
You have made your point.
We are very grateful.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.728
- I need you to center yourself.
- No. It's--

25:19.811 --> 25:21.897
- No. I need you to ce-- Adam.
- It's not the time. Not--

25:21.980 --> 25:23.982
You cannot protect this family
if you are not centered.

25:24.483 --> 25:25.859
Close your eyes.

25:30.155 --> 25:31.240
Now breathe in.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.159
And out.

25:36.453 --> 25:37.829
Feel it rise.

25:39.081 --> 25:41.375
Come out through the top of your head.

25:42.501 --> 25:44.336
And then imagine a golden light.

25:50.509 --> 25:52.302
Do you feel better?

25:54.096 --> 25:55.097
Yes?

25:56.056 --> 25:58.392
Okay. Look at me.

25:59.476 --> 26:01.395
Small men proceed from fear.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.772
We are not small.

26:04.356 --> 26:07.150
I want these people and their negativity
out of my home.

26:07.234 --> 26:10.320
They are ruining my floors. All right?

26:12.573 --> 26:15.492
Talk to Bruce. Tell him you can fix this.

26:15.576 --> 26:17.536
He wants to believe in you. He always has.

26:20.956 --> 26:22.165
Yes.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.710
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:24.793 --> 26:27.337
- Talking to Bruce.
- Yes. Good.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.383
- Calling Bruce.
- Okay.

26:35.470 --> 26:36.930
Thank you for picking up.

26:39.266 --> 26:40.517
I'm coming to see you.

26:41.852 --> 26:43.228
Now.

26:45.981 --> 26:49.193
Perfect. Keep that tone.
Keep that intention.

26:50.819 --> 26:52.196
You can manifest this.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.756
Bruce.

27:10.839 --> 27:11.840
Adam.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.177
Matthew.

27:16.386 --> 27:17.471
And Jacob.

27:18.013 --> 27:22.559
They reached out to me. They had a few
things they wanted to get off their chest.

27:22.643 --> 27:26.396
I see, I see.
What is the expression?

27:26.897 --> 27:30.442
Like rats abandoning a sinking ship.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.820
Unfortunately, our ship isn't sinking.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.240
But it's good to know who the rats are.

27:36.323 --> 27:38.575
Well, we just want what's best
for the company.

27:38.659 --> 27:42.204
What is best for the company is me as CEO.

27:42.287 --> 27:45.749
- Adam, I don't--
- Always has been, always will be.

27:45.832 --> 27:49.753
Please, you're going to listen
to these two geniuses?

27:49.837 --> 27:51.922
One walks around like a mermaid

27:52.005 --> 27:54.466
and the other has "cock"
written on his forehead.

27:54.550 --> 28:00.639
Please, let the children go home,
and the adults can have a conversation.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.182
- No, let them go.
- No, Adam,

28:02.266 --> 28:04.643
I really don't see any reason
for them to leave.

28:04.726 --> 28:08.272
Fine. Learn something.
Grab a pen. Take some notes.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.983
Take some notes.
I'm going to teach you something.

28:11.483 --> 28:12.526
Okay.

28:13.610 --> 28:14.736
So listen to me.

28:14.820 --> 28:18.490
This is what I'm willing to do to counter
the ridiculous narrative out there.

28:18.574 --> 28:23.203
First, I'm reducing my voting control
from 20 votes per share to 10.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.291
Second, I'm appointing a lead
independent director to the board.

28:27.374 --> 28:28.667
I thought you'd like that.

28:29.334 --> 28:33.213
Third, Rebekah will no longer choose
my successor.

28:33.297 --> 28:38.260
And finally, finally, even though
the board never objected

28:38.343 --> 28:42.222
and everything was entirely
aboveboard, as you know,

28:42.306 --> 28:44.474
I'll be returning the 5.9 million

28:44.558 --> 28:47.227
that the company paid me
for the We trademark.

28:48.770 --> 28:50.814
So you can see I'm giving here, Bruce.

28:50.898 --> 28:54.818
I'm giving.
I'm giving, and I'm ready to receive.

28:57.529 --> 28:59.156
You bet on me once.

28:59.990 --> 29:01.867
Believe in me again.

29:01.950 --> 29:04.286
You understand? Believe in me.

29:08.498 --> 29:09.917
You're toxic.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.546
You killed the company.

29:19.426 --> 29:20.677
You don't resign,

29:21.803 --> 29:23.639
I'll break your fucking arm.

29:27.226 --> 29:28.268
Bruce.

29:35.526 --> 29:37.402
I know, I know. But thanks.

29:38.153 --> 29:39.696
Sorry I'm late, gentlemen.

29:40.614 --> 29:43.242
I can see you've gotten started.

29:43.325 --> 29:46.787
No, no-- Jamie, I did everything
you asked me to.

29:46.870 --> 29:49.289
- I did it all.
- You did nothing I asked you.

29:49.373 --> 29:51.124
I did everything you asked me to.

29:51.208 --> 29:54.878
Adam, we cannot take the company
public with you as CEO.

29:54.962 --> 29:57.047
- No one will buy the stock. Adam.
- No, no.

29:59.508 --> 30:01.260
Bruce, I--

30:01.343 --> 30:04.346
No, no. I will never
not be the CEO of WeWork.

30:04.429 --> 30:05.597
Okay.

30:07.933 --> 30:09.184
Let's look ahead, shall we?

30:09.268 --> 30:11.311
Please. To the future.

30:11.395 --> 30:16.066
WeWork will run out of cash sooner
than you can imagine and go bankrupt.

30:16.984 --> 30:19.111
Your shares will go zero.

30:19.194 --> 30:23.657
The $380 million of personal loans that
you've taken out against those shares

30:23.740 --> 30:26.118
will be called in,
and you will be ruined, Adam.

30:27.077 --> 30:30.497
But, yeah, you'll still be CEO.

30:36.503 --> 30:39.298
We are not your enemies, Adam. You are.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.135
You are your own worst enemy.

30:53.187 --> 30:54.563
Shit.

30:58.942 --> 30:59.943
Well?

31:00.027 --> 31:01.153
Shit!

31:03.614 --> 31:05.490
It was an ambush.

31:05.574 --> 31:07.117
"Unnamed source says

31:07.201 --> 31:10.871
Bruce Dunlevie threatened to break
Adam Neumann's arm

31:11.371 --> 31:13.790
if he doesn't step down as CEO."

31:14.374 --> 31:16.251
Just posted on BuzzFeed.

31:16.835 --> 31:19.004
I told you to stay in the foxhole.

31:19.087 --> 31:20.506
Judas!

31:21.381 --> 31:23.509
Judas and Judas.

31:26.136 --> 31:28.055
Masa, I know it's late there.

31:28.138 --> 31:30.098
Thank you for picking up.
I'll keep it brief.

31:30.682 --> 31:32.684
- Adam.
-<i>You have billions at stake,</i>

31:32.768 --> 31:35.229
<i>and I am the only one who can
safeguard that investment.</i>

31:35.312 --> 31:39.983
You need me as CEO, and the company
must IPO or it'll run out of cash.

31:40.067 --> 31:42.319
<i>There will be no IPO.</i>

31:42.402 --> 31:44.446
If you go forward with it,

31:45.864 --> 31:49.618
you will embarrass yourself,
the company and me.

31:50.744 --> 31:51.745
Stand down.

31:51.828 --> 31:55.415
Masa, listen to me. With all due respect,
I'm not going to stand down.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.876
I will not let you proceed.

31:57.960 --> 31:59.753
What do you mean, "not let" me?

31:59.837 --> 32:02.089
<i>I will not let you.</i>

32:02.172 --> 32:06.635
I will use all my power, all my resources,
to block the IPO,

32:06.718 --> 32:09.263
and you will be left with nothing.

32:32.494 --> 32:34.997
But there's nothing to worry about.
Adam's all--

32:36.707 --> 32:39.084
You know I don't like it
when you talk about him like that.

32:40.460 --> 32:42.671
No, I don't. No, it's not ok--

32:42.754 --> 32:44.923
There is a spy outside the building!

32:45.007 --> 32:47.634
A spy. A spy!

32:47.718 --> 32:49.136
Daddy, let me call you back.

32:49.219 --> 32:51.513
Masa, Bruce, they've hired spies.

32:51.597 --> 32:52.806
Okay, honey.

32:53.599 --> 32:55.392
There's just not spies
outside the building.

32:55.475 --> 32:57.603
- No. There is a spy--
- There could be.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.272
- Ju--
- Yes, yes, yes.

33:00.355 --> 33:03.609
He looked ex-Mossad, right?

33:03.692 --> 33:04.693
Why?

33:04.776 --> 33:06.945
- We're in trouble.
- Why do you think he's a spy?

33:07.029 --> 33:09.865
Because he's standing
outside the building, very intently

33:09.948 --> 33:11.700
listening in my conversation,
eavesdropping.

33:11.783 --> 33:14.077
- Did he have a salt and pepper beard?
- Yes, he had that salt.

33:14.161 --> 33:16.872
And sort of, like, sad hound dog eyes?

33:16.955 --> 33:18.749
- Yes.
- Okay, my love.

33:18.832 --> 33:21.168
That is Mr. Fishman, in 4A.

33:21.251 --> 33:25.005
He smokes his horrible cigars
outside every single day.

33:25.088 --> 33:27.216
He's lived in the building for 23 years.

33:27.299 --> 33:30.427
He's not a spy.
It's all right. It's all right.

33:31.762 --> 33:33.805
Was this the call you were on?

33:36.808 --> 33:41.438
"Embattled CEO wanders NYC streets
barefoot, looking frantic."

33:43.315 --> 33:44.942
It's definitely going viral.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.026
Viral?

33:46.109 --> 33:47.945
HomeGardenGnome commented,

33:48.028 --> 33:51.156
"No one who walks around barefoot
in New York

33:51.240 --> 33:54.201
should be in charge
of a multibillion-dollar company."

33:54.284 --> 33:56.870
BirdieBoy says, "Enjoy the ringworm."

33:56.954 --> 34:00.415
Enough, please. Please. Enough.

34:00.499 --> 34:04.127
Someone just made his bare feet an emoji.
It's being used like a thumbs down.

34:04.211 --> 34:06.797
Machosammy,
"Does he think he's Jesus?"

34:06.880 --> 34:08.257
Babygene7151,

34:08.340 --> 34:10.592
"He's walking around
in filth and excrement.

34:10.676 --> 34:12.261
What a complete fucking nut--"

34:12.344 --> 34:13.971
Enough!

34:14.054 --> 34:17.933
He grew up on a fucking kibbutz.
He likes to walk around barefoot.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.685
Is that a fucking crime?

34:38.370 --> 34:39.371
Let it go.

34:42.331 --> 34:43.417
The IPO?

34:44.001 --> 34:45.377
All of it.

34:47.713 --> 34:48.714
No.

34:53.719 --> 34:55.469
You said it was all for me?

34:56.929 --> 34:58.056
And it is.

35:00.309 --> 35:01.643
I don't need it.

35:05.147 --> 35:07.941
Let it go for me. For us.

35:19.328 --> 35:22.456
- You know what happens if I step down.
- I know.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.502
But this…

35:28.795 --> 35:30.964
This is all that matters.

35:31.715 --> 35:34.927
You, me, the kids.

35:35.010 --> 35:37.012
We can live on the farm.

35:39.264 --> 35:41.350
We can be wild. We can

35:42.309 --> 35:45.062
howl at the moon like the old days.

35:52.778 --> 35:54.112
Will you howl with me?

36:04.748 --> 36:06.333
Money doesn't matter.

36:08.210 --> 36:11.672
The only people who say that
are the ones who always had it.

36:11.755 --> 36:15.259
And maybe having too much
is just as bad as not having any at all.

36:15.342 --> 36:17.219
Trust me, <i>motek</i>.

36:18.011 --> 36:19.012
It's not.

37:05.976 --> 37:07.352
Miggy-Migs.

37:07.436 --> 37:10.063
Hey. What are you doing here?

37:14.443 --> 37:15.611
São Paulo?

37:17.571 --> 37:20.574
Nope. This is Reykjavík.

37:21.158 --> 37:22.659
- In Iceland.
- Reykjavik.

37:22.743 --> 37:25.871
Yeah, we found
an old fish filet warehouse.

37:27.039 --> 37:28.123
Smelt.

37:28.749 --> 37:30.667
- Smelt?
- Smelt.

37:31.877 --> 37:33.378
They're these little fish.

37:33.462 --> 37:34.755
Apparently, they reek.

37:36.131 --> 37:39.301
We spent 45,000 fumigating.

37:42.262 --> 37:43.847
Whoever smelt it dealt it.

37:47.601 --> 37:49.269
Whoever dealt it, felt it.

37:53.065 --> 37:55.901
Listen. You frustrate me.

37:57.986 --> 37:59.863
Like no one I've ever met.

38:01.448 --> 38:03.534
- Yeah.
- You always have.

38:06.537 --> 38:07.788
But I love you.

38:13.544 --> 38:15.212
You don't deserve this.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.633
I love you too, Miguel.

38:23.220 --> 38:24.596
What are you going to do?

38:31.103 --> 38:32.521
The right thing.

38:33.564 --> 38:34.648
For once.

38:39.194 --> 38:40.571
Is there a motion?

38:40.654 --> 38:41.989
So moved.

38:42.656 --> 38:43.866
Is there a second?

38:43.949 --> 38:44.950
Seconded.

38:45.033 --> 38:46.827
Properly moved and seconded.

38:46.910 --> 38:51.039
All those in favor of removing
Adam Neumann as CEO,

38:51.123 --> 38:53.709
please signify by saying, "Aye."

38:54.334 --> 38:55.335
Aye.

38:56.253 --> 38:57.254
Aye.

38:58.297 --> 38:59.464
Aye.

38:59.548 --> 39:00.924
Aye.

39:01.008 --> 39:02.134
Aye.

39:02.217 --> 39:03.218
Aye.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.388
Aye.

39:13.187 --> 39:14.188
Aye.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.716
<i>Thank you all for making
yourselves available</i>

39:42.799 --> 39:44.760
<i>at such late notice.</i>

39:44.843 --> 39:47.930
<i>I'm sure you have questions,
and I do want to answer them,</i>

39:48.013 --> 39:51.016
<i>but if it's all right,
I would like to say something first.</i>

39:51.725 --> 39:54.478
When I marched
into our architect's office

39:54.561 --> 39:57.481
with the six foundational principles
of WeGrow,

39:58.065 --> 40:01.777
I told him,
"Bjarke, we've got a deadline."

40:01.860 --> 40:02.986
'Cause…

40:04.238 --> 40:07.032
I knew, as a mom,

40:07.699 --> 40:12.955
that it was my responsibility to use
everything I have learned in this world

40:13.038 --> 40:15.499
to reimagine early childhood education.

40:15.582 --> 40:17.251
Not just for my kids.

40:19.127 --> 40:20.921
But for all children.

40:24.174 --> 40:26.927
What I didn't know was that…

40:30.681 --> 40:34.810
this school would become my sixth child.

40:34.893 --> 40:35.894
My…

40:38.689 --> 40:41.733
proudest achievement after my own family.

40:46.655 --> 40:50.075
Which is why it breaks my heart
to tell you

40:50.158 --> 40:53.203
that WeGrow will be closing
at the end of this school year.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.291
Schools locked next year's admissions
months ago.

40:57.374 --> 41:00.294
- My child is on scholarship.
- Rebekah, what's happening?

41:00.377 --> 41:04.423
I hear you, I hear you and I promise you,

41:04.506 --> 41:07.759
each and every one of your children

41:07.843 --> 41:11.847
has learned the meaning of resilience
and adaptability.

41:11.930 --> 41:14.141
What the fuck are you talking about?

41:14.224 --> 41:17.811
Resilience and adaptability
won't pay for my kid's tuition.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.563
Okay. Okay…

41:20.564 --> 41:23.192
So, okay, we'll-- Loo-- I--

41:24.902 --> 41:27.404
- Start your own school.
- You can't be serious.

41:27.487 --> 41:28.488
Fuck you, Rebekah.

41:29.573 --> 41:31.491
- Yeah.
- No way.

41:39.333 --> 41:42.211
"While our business
has never been stronger,

41:42.294 --> 41:44.838
in recent weeks the scrutiny
directed toward me

41:44.922 --> 41:47.299
has become a significant distraction.

41:48.091 --> 41:52.179
I have decided that it is in the best
interest of the company to step down

41:52.262 --> 41:53.388
as chief executive."

41:53.472 --> 41:55.224
- Jesus.
- Fucking dick.

41:56.183 --> 41:57.184
Hey, Chloe.

42:00.562 --> 42:03.440
She sold that bag to a woman
on the Upper East Side.

42:04.149 --> 42:05.484
She lost $5,000.

42:05.567 --> 42:06.485
What?

42:06.568 --> 42:08.111
I told her to get it.

42:09.071 --> 42:11.865
Hey, where's Bea?
I haven't seen her in a while.

42:12.950 --> 42:15.452
Bea got accepted to HBS.
She peaced out.

42:15.536 --> 42:17.246
Bea got into Harvard Business School?

42:17.329 --> 42:18.247
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:18.330 --> 42:20.249
She wrote her admissions essay
about WeWork

42:20.332 --> 42:21.750
and how not to grow a start-up.

42:23.126 --> 42:24.962
Guys. Everyone.

42:25.712 --> 42:27.422
I think he's about to start.

42:27.965 --> 42:29.633
Everyone, can you come, please?

42:30.592 --> 42:34.263
Guys from the computers,
can you bring it around?

42:44.356 --> 42:45.774
Are you gonna sing?

42:47.317 --> 42:48.652
No, I'm not gonna sing.

42:49.695 --> 42:51.905
I know that this has been a…

42:52.990 --> 42:56.910
confusing and stressful time.

42:56.994 --> 42:59.955
And I know there's been a lot of rumors
and speculation.

43:00.914 --> 43:03.083
About what's happening.

43:06.295 --> 43:11.675
So, I thought you should hear
about the future of our company.

43:11.758 --> 43:13.594
Of your company…

43:16.555 --> 43:18.682
directly from its new CEO.

43:19.266 --> 43:20.934
- So…
- Okay.

43:24.688 --> 43:26.315
- Cameron Lautner.
- What?

43:26.398 --> 43:27.691
So, Cam.

43:28.400 --> 43:29.610
Is this a joke?

43:30.194 --> 43:32.446
- Come on.
- Whoa.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.335
Adam Neumann.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.003
Boo.

43:50.506 --> 43:52.591
Adam Neumann.

43:54.134 --> 43:56.637
He's been called lots of things,
hasn't he?

43:57.554 --> 43:59.097
What is he, a visionary?

44:00.057 --> 44:03.810
Unicorn? Maverick? A magician?

44:04.811 --> 44:10.108
And like a magician,
he's tried to perform a sleight of hand

44:10.192 --> 44:12.027
over the entire financial world.

44:12.110 --> 44:17.574
Crafted an illusion that you all
were part of something bigger.

44:18.158 --> 44:21.203
What were you gonna do?
Raise the world's consciousness?

44:21.286 --> 44:25.040
Solve world hunger?
Care for all the world's orphans?

44:25.123 --> 44:28.418
Excuse me, how the fuck
is a shared work space company

44:28.502 --> 44:30.087
supposed to do any of that?

44:30.671 --> 44:33.632
He deluded you. He did!

44:33.715 --> 44:36.927
And what's worse is
you deluded yourselves.

44:37.845 --> 44:39.721
Because you forgot what every child knows.

44:39.805 --> 44:41.682
Unicorns don't exist.

44:42.391 --> 44:46.144
They don't. Sorry to be the bearer,
but that's the truth.

44:46.228 --> 44:48.146
No matter how much we might want them to.

44:48.230 --> 44:51.525
So I think it's about time
that we got really honest

44:51.608 --> 44:53.986
about what we actually do here.

44:54.069 --> 44:56.780
We're not here to raise
the world's consciousness.

44:56.864 --> 44:59.658
That's not how capitalism works.

44:59.741 --> 45:03.537
We're here to earn value
for our investors,

45:03.620 --> 45:07.583
and we're going to do that by providing
high-quality shared work spaces

45:07.666 --> 45:09.501
at a competitive price.

45:09.585 --> 45:14.548
And what are you going to get in return?
A fair wage and real profit sharing.

45:14.631 --> 45:18.010
Adam says, "Do what you love"?
Is that right?

45:18.093 --> 45:22.181
"Do what you love,
the money, oh, it will follow."

45:22.264 --> 45:23.182
What?

45:23.891 --> 45:26.852
No, sir. Excuse me, it's hard work.

45:26.935 --> 45:30.230
That's the truth of it, isn't it?
It's hard fucking work.

45:30.314 --> 45:32.441
Work sucks
and that's what you've got to do.

45:32.524 --> 45:35.736
That, along with a little bit of luck,
and then you'll make the moola.

45:35.819 --> 45:39.781
So, I want to know who's with me.

45:41.200 --> 45:45.287
Who's ready to put down
these childish fantasies

45:45.370 --> 45:48.874
of saving the world and unicorns,

45:48.957 --> 45:54.546
and who wants to be part
of a real, sustainable company,

45:54.630 --> 45:57.799
with a future
that you can really believe in?

45:58.383 --> 46:00.969
- Who's ready? Let me hear you.
- Yeah.

46:01.970 --> 46:03.931
Look, there's an adult in charge now.

46:04.848 --> 46:06.183
And I assure you,

46:07.392 --> 46:10.270
WeWork's best days are ahead.

46:11.188 --> 46:13.315
Thank you for your time. Go back to work.

46:19.238 --> 46:20.739
We're fucked.

46:23.450 --> 46:24.660
We're fucked!

46:25.911 --> 46:28.580
I divested from the wave pool company,
sold "Air Cannabis,"

46:28.664 --> 46:30.290
whatever he was calling that fucking jet.

46:30.374 --> 46:32.751
Got rid of that goddamn school,
and we're still bleeding money

46:32.835 --> 46:34.419
out of our fucking tits.

46:34.503 --> 46:35.838
We need to do something.

46:37.881 --> 46:38.882
Layoffs.

46:38.966 --> 46:42.302
Layoffs means severance.
Severance means money.

46:42.386 --> 46:44.721
We don't have--
We can't afford to fucking fire people,

46:44.805 --> 46:46.390
that's how fucked we are-- Yes?

46:46.473 --> 46:49.101
You have the board meeting in a half-hour.
You should get going.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.107
Okay.

46:55.190 --> 46:56.525
Okay. Come on.

46:56.608 --> 46:58.652
We gotta do something,
gotta say something, boy.

46:58.735 --> 47:00.237
Gotta say something.

47:02.489 --> 47:04.533
I don't know what--

47:06.910 --> 47:08.203
What would Adam do?

47:10.080 --> 47:12.666
We need cash. Simple as that.

47:12.749 --> 47:15.752
We need cash or WeWork's
gonna run out of money.

47:15.836 --> 47:17.963
- When?
- Under two months.

47:18.046 --> 47:19.089
What? Are you serious?

47:19.173 --> 47:22.467
How are we finding out about this now?
How is that possible?

47:22.551 --> 47:24.469
Go on, Miguel. Why don't you tell them
how you and Adam

47:24.553 --> 47:25.846
cocked this whole thing up?

47:28.015 --> 47:31.226
We accelerated expansion
ahead of the IPO.

47:31.310 --> 47:32.436
Okay.

47:32.519 --> 47:35.022
Construction is expensive,
especially when you're trying to rush it.

47:35.105 --> 47:37.524
- Yeah. Of course.
- No shit.

47:37.608 --> 47:41.195
You were the guys who wanted
to impress the markets, so--

47:41.278 --> 47:44.114
All right, that-- that stops now.

47:44.198 --> 47:46.074
No more new locations.

47:46.158 --> 47:47.367
We already signed the leases.

47:47.451 --> 47:48.535
Oh, Jesus.

47:48.619 --> 47:49.453
How many?

47:50.370 --> 47:51.413
We're doubling in size.

47:51.496 --> 47:54.708
- That's fucking stupid.
- Time out. Time out! You said double?

47:54.791 --> 47:57.377
All right, all right. So…

47:57.461 --> 47:59.379
We're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?

47:59.463 --> 48:01.590
We need billions of dollars, right?

48:01.673 --> 48:05.135
And we need it in the next eight weeks,
so who do we know?

48:05.219 --> 48:09.181
Well, we have at least one investor
with pockets deep enough to do that.

48:09.264 --> 48:10.265
SoftBank.

48:10.349 --> 48:15.187
They won't come in now.
Not while Adam has the controlling vote.

48:15.270 --> 48:16.605
He's stepped down as CEO,

48:16.688 --> 48:18.649
but the prick still has
the majority of shares.

48:18.732 --> 48:22.236
Which means, CEO or not,
we can't override his vote.

48:22.319 --> 48:23.612
Shit.

48:26.448 --> 48:28.325
That fucking wanker.

48:30.994 --> 48:32.788
Money doesn't matter.

48:32.871 --> 48:36.208
The only people who say that
are the ones who always had it.

48:36.291 --> 48:40.003
And maybe having too much
is just as bad as not having any at all.

48:40.087 --> 48:41.797
Trust me, <i>motek</i>.

48:42.631 --> 48:43.882
It's not.

48:53.267 --> 48:55.811
And the only one who knows that
more than me

48:56.770 --> 48:57.855
is Masa.

48:57.938 --> 48:59.606
<i>You see what he's doing here, right?</i>

48:59.690 --> 49:04.319
Adam knows Masa is trying to raise
$100 billion for Vision Fund 2.

49:04.945 --> 49:07.447
That's going to be impossible
if the fucking crown jewel

49:07.531 --> 49:10.284
of Vision Fund 1 has gone bankrupt, right?

49:11.201 --> 49:14.454
Yeah, but if WeWork goes bankrupt,

49:14.538 --> 49:17.291
all of Adam's lenders are coming for him.

49:18.125 --> 49:19.418
He'll lose everything.

49:20.544 --> 49:23.213
Well, I guess it comes down
to one question then, doesn't it?

49:23.297 --> 49:25.257
Sorry, what question?

49:27.050 --> 49:28.594
<i>Who's gonna blink first?</i>

49:59.166 --> 50:00.375
Masa.

50:01.001 --> 50:02.836
You're the crazier one.

50:06.131 --> 50:09.343
500 million for you to sell your shares.

50:12.429 --> 50:13.430
<i>Adam?</i>

50:14.515 --> 50:15.807
<i>Are you still there?</i>

50:19.102 --> 50:20.437
Yes.

50:21.021 --> 50:22.481
Did you hear my offer?

50:22.564 --> 50:23.649
<i>Yes.</i>

50:25.901 --> 50:27.027
Well?

50:30.280 --> 50:31.281
No.

50:42.626 --> 50:43.961
What did he say?

50:45.546 --> 50:49.049
<i>He made an offer.
He'll make another one.</i>

50:52.177 --> 50:53.971
Are you sure?

50:54.054 --> 50:57.474
<i>A high-stakes standoff
is playing out behind closed doors</i>

50:57.558 --> 50:59.726
<i>over the fate of WeWork.</i>

51:41.643 --> 51:42.644
Yes?

51:42.728 --> 51:44.813
<i>Adam Neumann
essentially getting to ride off</i>

51:44.897 --> 51:48.400
<i>into the sunset, like you said there,
with a golden parachute.</i>

51:48.483 --> 51:52.446
<i>This deal includes $975 million</i>

51:52.529 --> 51:56.325
<i>for a cap-out to buy shares
that Neumann owns,</i>

51:56.408 --> 51:58.535
<i>$500 million for a loan</i>

51:58.619 --> 52:03.081
<i>and $185 million for a "consulting fee."</i>

52:03.165 --> 52:05.209
<i>He's now going to step down
from the board,</i>

52:05.292 --> 52:10.839
<i>and this will see SoftBank
take 80% of this troubled company.</i>

52:10.923 --> 52:13.550
<i>We're already seeing some employees
really worried</i>

52:13.634 --> 52:16.595
<i>about what this massive payout
for Adam Neumann means.</i>

54:33.524 --> 54:34.525
See?

54:35.108 --> 54:36.944
This is all we need.

54:37.903 --> 54:41.990
Water, sun, air, us.

54:43.492 --> 54:44.910
I feel reborn.

54:51.083 --> 54:52.084
What?

54:53.460 --> 54:54.837
Just got the email.

54:55.921 --> 54:57.130
It's official.

54:58.590 --> 54:59.591
Ho--

54:59.675 --> 55:03.053
It's the rights for the curriculum
for WeGrow.

55:03.136 --> 55:04.513
I bought them for you.

55:07.349 --> 55:09.518
Of course, we can't use the name WeGrow,

55:10.686 --> 55:12.521
but I know you'll think of something.

55:19.278 --> 55:20.946
Thank you so much.

55:21.029 --> 55:23.198
No, thank you. Thank you.

55:26.994 --> 55:29.955
Oh, wait, honey. Adam, your goggles.

55:30.038 --> 55:32.124
Don't worry about me. I know the Dead Sea.

55:32.207 --> 55:33.792
I'm an old Navy man.

55:33.876 --> 55:37.004
Okay, just please.
The salt, your eyes, just--

55:37.546 --> 55:40.674
How are you doing?
Do you want to watch your daddy swim?

55:40.757 --> 55:43.760
You want to watch me?
I'm going look for a whale. Okay.

55:43.844 --> 55:47.181
I'm going to bring one back for you.
You watch!

55:59.651 --> 56:00.736
Adam!

56:07.201 --> 56:08.202
Hello?

56:08.702 --> 56:10.370
<i>Oh, Rebekah. How are you?</i>

56:10.454 --> 56:12.331
How is Tel Aviv?

56:12.414 --> 56:13.498
Good.

56:14.124 --> 56:16.668
<i>Good. I'm looking for Adam.</i>

56:16.752 --> 56:19.296
Yeah. He just went for a swim,

56:19.379 --> 56:22.883
but do you want to leave a message?

56:23.509 --> 56:26.678
No, no. No message. Just a question.

56:26.762 --> 56:28.555
<i>For you.</i>

56:28.639 --> 56:29.890
Okay.

56:31.391 --> 56:34.561
Who wins in a fight?
The smart one or the crazy one?

56:35.145 --> 56:36.647
What?

56:36.730 --> 56:38.899
Who wins in a fight?

56:38.982 --> 56:41.443
<i>The smart one or the crazy one?</i>

56:46.949 --> 56:48.158
The smart one.

56:48.784 --> 56:50.869
<i>You're smarter than your husband.</i>

56:50.953 --> 56:52.454
<i>He said the crazy one.</i>

56:53.914 --> 56:55.541
But it's a trick question.

56:55.624 --> 56:58.001
It's not the smart one or the crazy one.

57:01.088 --> 57:02.130
Then who?

57:03.715 --> 57:06.426
The one with all the money.

57:11.223 --> 57:13.892
I-I don't understand,
what are you…

57:16.854 --> 57:19.064
You will never get that buyout package.

57:19.147 --> 57:20.899
Not a single penny.

57:20.983 --> 57:22.526
I will make sure of it.

57:26.029 --> 57:28.365
You and Adam have a deal.

57:29.283 --> 57:32.870
The next time we speak
will be through lawyers.

57:34.413 --> 57:35.372
Ma--

57:35.873 --> 57:36.874
A--

57:39.001 --> 57:40.002
Adam.

57:40.085 --> 57:43.839
Adam. Adam. Adam.

57:43.922 --> 57:45.465
Adam, the money.

57:46.758 --> 57:48.051
The money!

57:49.636 --> 57:51.722
My eyes. My eyes!

57:51.805 --> 57:53.891
- Adam, the money!
- I can't see!

57:53.974 --> 57:55.851
- Adam!
- My eyes, I can't see.

57:55.934 --> 57:57.352
I can't see.

57:57.436 --> 57:58.395
Adam! The money!

57:58.478 --> 58:00.647
Help us! Please!

59:05.712 --> 59:07.881
When I met Rebekah
about nine years ago,

59:07.965 --> 59:12.094
and then she was my girlfriend, um,
I weighed about 20 pounds less than today.

59:12.177 --> 59:14.596
I was smoking
two packs of cigarettes a day,

59:14.680 --> 59:16.765
I had a lot of very unhealthy habits.

59:16.849 --> 59:19.977
And even though I was a big talker,
I had nothing to show for it.

59:20.060 --> 59:22.020
The first thing she told me is,
'You're full of shit.''

59:22.104 --> 59:23.397
That was the first thing.

59:23.480 --> 59:27.109
"You talk like you are all that,
you literally can't even buy me dinner."

59:27.192 --> 59:29.236
She said, "Even though this--
I do believe in equality

59:29.319 --> 59:30.654
between men and women."
She said,

59:30.737 --> 59:32.990
"It's okay if you paid for dinner
one time, it's not a bad thing."

59:33.073 --> 59:35.617
Because I would offer to pay,
being polite, and he would accept.

59:35.701 --> 59:38.745
Which just was completely strange
for an American girl.

59:38.829 --> 59:40.873
And she said-- she said to me,

59:40.956 --> 59:44.668
"If you don't immediately
stop chasing the wrong thing,

59:44.751 --> 59:46.420
actually find your passion,

59:46.503 --> 59:48.964
find what it is that makes a difference
for you.

59:49.047 --> 59:52.676
Find, and then take that, mix it with
what you do, what you love at the most."

59:52.759 --> 59:54.595
Which in my case
is bringing people together.

59:54.678 --> 59:56.805
And I do happen to love buildings,
I don't know why.

59:56.889 --> 59:59.474
"If you don't find a way to bring
these two things together

59:59.558 --> 1:00:01.476
and really do something meaningful
for the world,

1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:04.062
not only will nothing you do
never really work,

1:00:04.146 --> 1:00:06.940
even if something did work,
you'll never feel fulfilled."

1:00:07.024 --> 1:00:09.693
She said, "My suggestion for you is,
drop everything you're doing,

1:00:09.776 --> 1:00:11.028
go find something real.

1:00:11.111 --> 1:00:14.114
Stop worrying about the bottom line,
because it's not about that.

1:00:14.198 --> 1:00:17.534
Redefine success and fulfillment
as something greater than yourself,

1:00:17.618 --> 1:00:20.287
and the rest will follow."
I have to say, I did all of that.

1:00:20.370 --> 1:00:22.122
- Rebekah, I want to say thank you.
- Adam, my love.

1:00:22.206 --> 1:00:24.124
- I'd be nothing without you.
- Well put.
