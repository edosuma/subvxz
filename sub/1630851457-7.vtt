WEBVTT

00:29.791 --> 00:32.458
You're distant, Dan.
Is everything okay?

00:32.541 --> 00:34.541
-Yeah.
-Well, okay then.

00:34.625 --> 00:36.541
We'll be making the jump
to hyperspace soon.

00:36.625 --> 00:37.875
Mmm.

00:37.958 --> 00:40.500
You know, I've never been
to this sector. Can't wait.

00:40.583 --> 00:43.958
-Hmm. Is that so?
-It is.

00:46.625 --> 00:48.916
Master, I have been meaning to ask you…

00:49.541 --> 00:52.541
Do you have any idea
how many planets you've visited so far?

00:53.750 --> 00:55.125
Oh, let me think.

00:55.958 --> 00:57.875
I really couldn't say
off the top of my head.

00:58.750 --> 01:02.041
Well, you must hold the Jedi record
for most planets visited,

01:02.666 --> 01:04.625
based on all the stories
I've heard anyway.

01:04.708 --> 01:07.333
Well, I really doubt that.

01:07.416 --> 01:10.083
Master,
patrolling this area was postponed.

01:10.666 --> 01:14.291
That is, until you decided to go
and volunteer us to do it.

01:14.375 --> 01:16.666
You seemed obsessed
about getting back out here.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.750
Obsessed?

01:17.833 --> 01:21.291
Actually, I thought it would be good
for you if we visited the Outer Rim.

01:21.375 --> 01:23.833
It's a little different
than what I expected.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.166
Oh, really? How so?

01:26.250 --> 01:29.541
For one, I was hoping for something
a little more stimulating.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.791
Like, maybe more action.

01:31.875 --> 01:34.125
It's a lot more peaceful
than I thought it would be.

01:34.208 --> 01:39.333
The seeds of misfortune, when
in peaceful soil, can be easy to overlook.

01:41.291 --> 01:42.416
Do you sense something?

01:44.958 --> 01:49.333
Hmm. I sense a disturbance in the Force.

01:54.541 --> 01:56.041
Master, can you still sense it?

01:56.666 --> 01:57.666
Not anymore.

01:58.250 --> 02:00.291
Did you not feel anything earlier?

02:00.375 --> 02:01.750
Not a thing.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.416
If you had to guess,
what do you think it was,

02:04.500 --> 02:06.208
this disturbance that you felt?

02:07.666 --> 02:12.583
I sensed a darkness,
something ancient and sinister.

02:12.666 --> 02:14.583
Could it possibly be Sith?

02:14.666 --> 02:16.541
If so, you know I'm ready to fight!

02:16.625 --> 02:18.916
No, it cannot be Sith.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.541
It's been hundreds of years
since they were destroyed.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.500
But whatever it is,
we need to investigate.

02:24.583 --> 02:26.958
If it's that dark,
fighting would be the only way to do that.

02:27.041 --> 02:29.500
There's much eagerness from you, Dan.

02:29.583 --> 02:33.416
But no matter how confident,
a Jedi does not seek out aggression.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.166
A Jedi must find balance
and stillness.

02:37.250 --> 02:40.875
I know.
So, then, what should we do?

02:40.958 --> 02:43.833
The only inhabited planet
around here is Habo, right?

02:44.416 --> 02:47.291
-Have you been there?
-Yeah, quite a few times actually.

02:47.375 --> 02:49.041
That's my master!

02:49.125 --> 02:53.000
Always the only Jedi who knows it all
when it comes to the Outer Rim.

02:53.083 --> 02:55.166
I'm so lucky to be your Padawan.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.958
-Thank you.
-I was being sarcastic.

02:58.041 --> 02:59.750
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

03:00.458 --> 03:01.583
We should get going.

03:02.291 --> 03:03.500
Great.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.125
Besides, I had a feeling
patrolling the Outer Rim

03:06.208 --> 03:08.125
had to be more exciting than this.

03:09.125 --> 03:10.125
Hmm.

03:19.666 --> 03:23.875
The view from above was great,
but it's even more beautiful planetside.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.541
I think I'm going to like it here.

03:26.625 --> 03:29.125
Then you should try
the local dish called Oon-Doon.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.541
You'll like it even more.

03:30.625 --> 03:31.958
Sage wisdom, as always.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.125
Hmm?

03:46.666 --> 03:49.458
The people of this planet
are known to be quite shy.

03:49.541 --> 03:53.541
Why don't I go try to talk to them first?
It's best if you wait here.

03:53.625 --> 03:54.625
Understood.

04:04.458 --> 04:05.500
Hmm?

04:11.333 --> 04:12.333
Huh?

04:37.708 --> 04:39.375
I'm impressed.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.583
You've already broken through
the Habo kids' shells.

04:41.666 --> 04:43.541
So, did you find anything out?

04:43.625 --> 04:47.791
A couple of days ago,
an elder from an unknown tribe visited.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.916
When he arrived on his ship, he was alone.

04:50.000 --> 04:53.375
An elderly man? And from an unknown tribe?

04:53.458 --> 04:56.958
There are not that many visitors
to this planet in the first place.

04:57.041 --> 05:00.375
So for the Habo, there are
far more unknown tribes than not.

05:00.458 --> 05:04.041
Interesting.
Then where did this old man go?

05:04.708 --> 05:07.833
Apparently,
he went into the mountains by himself.

05:08.791 --> 05:11.791
Do you think this man is the same presence
you felt earlier?

05:11.875 --> 05:13.291
I wonder.

05:13.375 --> 05:16.833
I haven't felt the disturbance at all
since we arrived on this planet.

05:17.541 --> 05:19.041
Were we misdirected?

05:19.125 --> 05:20.750
No. I think the opposite.

05:21.500 --> 05:22.500
What's that mean?

05:23.333 --> 05:27.958
If it's this elder, he could be hiding
his presence, which means that he's close.

05:28.041 --> 05:29.416
You think so?

05:30.041 --> 05:32.125
But it also means he's noticed us.

05:33.750 --> 05:36.083
So then he's felt our presence as well.

05:36.666 --> 05:38.041
Not only that, but--

05:38.125 --> 05:41.083
and there's a chance
I may be overthinking this--

05:41.166 --> 05:43.208
there are a lot of things troubling me.

05:43.291 --> 05:46.208
No matter.
We need to look into who this elder is.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.208
Mmm. I agree.

05:48.291 --> 05:50.125
Should we head to the mountains then?

05:50.791 --> 05:53.583
If we do that,
we run the risk of missing him.

05:53.666 --> 05:56.708
It's safer to stay here
and watch over his ship.

05:56.791 --> 05:58.958
Then we'll be here when he returns.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.208
Better idea. Why don't we split up?

06:01.291 --> 06:05.208
I can head to the mountains,
and, Master, you watch the ship.

06:05.291 --> 06:08.708
Did you pick the mountain because
you're more likely to encounter him there?

06:08.791 --> 06:10.416
No, that isn't it.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.833
It just so happens that you're the one
who's better with ships,

06:13.916 --> 06:16.416
while I'm the one who's better
with mountain terrain.

06:16.500 --> 06:17.750
Best person for the job.

06:18.500 --> 06:22.041
If I were you though, I wouldn't
count me out on those mountains just yet.

06:22.625 --> 06:23.625
But that's okay.

06:25.666 --> 06:29.458
There are wild animals
called Vamga up there, so be careful.

06:30.083 --> 06:32.250
If you leave them alone,
they rarely attack.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.875
So if you run into one, don't provoke it.

06:36.250 --> 06:39.541
But if a Vamga is attacking the old man,
it's lightsabers out, right?

06:39.625 --> 06:42.791
Well, let's just hope, for your sake,
that doesn't happen.

06:43.375 --> 06:45.583
The mountains are tricky.
You should get a guide.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.166
Again, so wise.

06:58.166 --> 07:01.291
I wouldn't think an old man
could manage a path like this.

07:01.875 --> 07:04.375
-Hmm?

07:04.458 --> 07:06.833
Well, I should be one to talk.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.708
-Dan, you there?
-Yes, Master.

07:30.791 --> 07:33.500
I've located the old man's starship.

07:33.583 --> 07:35.250
It isn't a model I recognize,

07:35.333 --> 07:39.041
but it resembles the old Sith ships
I've seen in holos.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.000
Are you serious? The Sith?

07:41.083 --> 07:44.375
-That's right.
-So, then this elder is one of them?

07:44.458 --> 07:46.666
I'm really hoping that isn't true.

07:47.458 --> 07:50.375
-But I've got a bad feeling about this.
-Huh?

07:50.458 --> 07:53.000
-Wait a second.
-What is it?

07:53.083 --> 07:54.958
There's a Vamga's carcass.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.416
What?

07:56.500 --> 07:58.166
I'm going to check it out.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.791
-Be safe, Dan.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.791
-Master.

08:17.875 --> 08:18.958
What is it, Dan?

08:19.041 --> 08:21.541
It appears the Vamga has been cut down.

08:22.208 --> 08:25.000
Its throat's been slashed. A clean cut.

08:25.083 --> 08:28.458
Whoever it is that did this
must be extremely skilled.

08:28.541 --> 08:29.625
Clean cut?

08:29.708 --> 08:33.916
A lightsaber is the only weapon I know
that can cut a Vamga's throat like that.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.958
Looking at the wound,
this was definitely done by a lightsaber.

08:38.041 --> 08:39.500
You should head back, Dan.

08:39.583 --> 08:43.833
Whoever the elder turns out to be,
he's sure to be a dangerous opponent.

08:44.416 --> 08:45.875
-Yes, Master.

08:54.416 --> 08:55.958
A Jedi.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.583
So then, are you a Sith?

09:05.791 --> 09:10.291
The Sith became far too obsessed
with trying to outwit each other.

09:10.375 --> 09:14.333
It resulted in them
completely neglecting their destiny.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.541
And so, they are now extinct.

09:16.625 --> 09:18.500
Are you saying you're not a Sith?

09:19.291 --> 09:21.458
Let's not speak with our mouths…

09:25.500 --> 09:27.375
…but with our blades.

09:28.541 --> 09:29.833
Run. Get away, Dan.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.166
Hmm.

09:55.250 --> 09:58.083
-I guess you are not him after all.

09:58.166 --> 10:03.125
I sensed someone strong in the Force,
but it's not you. Must be the other.

10:03.208 --> 10:05.708
-No matter.

10:05.791 --> 10:09.250
Hunting the Vamga, it was not a challenge.

10:09.333 --> 10:12.458
But if I kill you,
your master will surely show himself.

10:12.541 --> 10:15.333
I won't be as easily defeated as a Vamga.

10:15.416 --> 10:17.666
I certainly hope not.

10:22.875 --> 10:26.250
You're only delaying the inevitable
with such futile defense.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.875
How incredibly boring you are.

11:15.125 --> 11:16.125
Better.

11:16.208 --> 11:20.875
It's been a while since I've come across
an opponent so strong in the Force.

11:49.625 --> 11:53.000
Yes! A worthy challenge.

11:53.083 --> 11:57.125
How I do wish I had met you long ago
when I was much stronger.

12:23.833 --> 12:25.083
That technique…

12:39.916 --> 12:41.125
Huh?

13:00.041 --> 13:01.416
Dan!

13:29.583 --> 13:31.541
It's been completely destroyed.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.791
Completely.

13:32.875 --> 13:35.500
Well, so much for trying to find a clue
in what's left of that.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.875
So, what do you think he was?

13:39.583 --> 13:41.958
I mean, he couldn't have been Sith, right?

13:42.500 --> 13:43.833
It's speculation.

13:43.916 --> 13:47.083
However, based on some of the things
he said to you,

13:47.166 --> 13:50.666
perhaps he was once part of the Sith
but then somehow broke away.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.000
It's the first time
I've confronted such darkness.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.625
It was a terrible power he had.

13:57.250 --> 13:59.583
If I had fought him
when he was in his prime,

13:59.666 --> 14:01.750
the results may have been much different.

14:02.833 --> 14:05.083
However, you did defeat him, Master.

14:05.166 --> 14:09.500
No. What defeated the elder
in the end was not me, but time.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.541
He couldn't win against the weakness
that comes with age.

14:13.041 --> 14:17.291
No matter how powerful you become,
know it will not last forever.

14:18.583 --> 14:21.000
So, then, are you saying
that power is meaningless?

14:21.083 --> 14:22.416
Not at all.

14:22.500 --> 14:25.208
With power,
you can protect those without it.

14:25.958 --> 14:28.958
However, like everything else,
it is impermanent.

14:29.916 --> 14:30.916
You're right.

14:31.000 --> 14:36.000
I am also becoming weaker,
and you shall continue to get stronger.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.875
For that is the way of the galaxy.

14:39.833 --> 14:41.833
You think I'll get stronger?

14:41.916 --> 14:43.333
Quite possibly.

14:43.916 --> 14:46.000
So long as you remember this:

14:46.083 --> 14:48.791
Do not forget your training
and your kindness.

14:50.750 --> 14:51.750
Mmm.

14:51.833 --> 14:53.333
-Huh?

14:56.875 --> 14:59.625
-Go on and say goodbye to your friends.

15:00.125 --> 15:04.375
You know, they were very worried about you
when you were recovering from your injury.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.458
Thank you, Master.
