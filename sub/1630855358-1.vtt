WEBVTT

02:20.908 --> 02:23.310
- Hello.

02:23.343 --> 02:24.612
Hi.

02:26.648 --> 02:28.248
I did want to order.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.586
Great.

02:31.619 --> 02:34.421
Do you guys have a waffle iron
down there?

02:35.823 --> 02:37.625
- You do.

02:37.659 --> 02:38.626
Okay.

02:38.660 --> 02:39.627
So what we'll do is--

02:41.763 --> 02:43.564
Just one second.

02:45.298 --> 02:46.400
Okay.

02:48.770 --> 02:50.605
Yes?

02:50.638 --> 02:52.607
- Hal?
- Yes.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.441
- I'm Rebecca Marin
with Lichter and Haynes.

02:54.474 --> 02:55.442
- Oh, right. Of course.

02:55.475 --> 02:56.443
Come in.

02:59.681 --> 03:01.248
Okay.

03:06.721 --> 03:08.556
Uh, is this okay, in here?

03:11.993 --> 03:12.994
- That's fine.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.662
- Just--I just need a second.

03:14.696 --> 03:16.631
I'm finishing up a call.

03:16.664 --> 03:17.665
- Sure.

03:17.699 --> 03:19.299
- Help yourself to whatever.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.971
- You still there? Great.

03:24.005 --> 03:25.472
So a Belgian waffle

03:25.506 --> 03:26.741
or, you know,
whatever kind of waffle.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.409
Do you have--do you have jam?

03:29.443 --> 03:31.546
Do you have passion fruit jam?

03:31.579 --> 03:33.480
Okay, great. Some of that.

03:33.514 --> 03:36.684
And then the spring pasta,
no shrimp,

03:36.718 --> 03:37.952
just with the tomatoes
and onions.

03:39.554 --> 03:42.255
Oh, and you have
the tartar, right?

03:42.289 --> 03:45.593
Okay, great some of that.

03:45.626 --> 03:48.529
Uh, and then the ribeye,
medium.

03:48.563 --> 03:49.864
- Test. Test.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.566
- Actually medium,
not medium rare.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.401
<i>- Test. Test.</i>

03:54.434 --> 03:55.703
- Almost done.

03:56.771 --> 03:59.339
Hash browns, creamed spinach.

03:59.372 --> 04:00.407
Mm-hmm.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.477
And then just two martinis

04:03.511 --> 04:05.646
and a bottle of Montepulciano.

04:07.314 --> 04:08.315
Yeah.

04:08.348 --> 04:09.851
And a hot fudge sundae.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.054
Perfect. Thanks so much.

04:18.325 --> 04:19.961
Sorry about that.

04:19.994 --> 04:20.995
- It's fine.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.397
Sounds good.

04:27.769 --> 04:28.936
- Oh.

04:28.970 --> 04:30.071
Oh, my God.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.438
Look at all this.

04:36.577 --> 04:39.680
Should we do some small talk?

04:39.714 --> 04:40.782
- We can.

04:40.815 --> 04:42.415
Do you live here in Denver?

04:42.449 --> 04:43.450
- We'll skip that.

04:43.483 --> 04:44.585
Let's skip the small talk.

04:44.619 --> 04:46.087
- Whatever you say.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.855
With your permission,
I'll start recording.

04:47.889 --> 04:48.689
- That's fine.

04:48.723 --> 04:51.592
I'm just gonna put on
some music.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.632
- This is Hal Porterfield's
updated background review.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.966
I am Rebecca Marin

04:59.000 --> 05:00.902
with Lichter, Haynes,
and Associates.

05:00.935 --> 05:02.537
Okay, just some general.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.436
What is your birthday?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.640
- April 7, 1987.

05:05.673 --> 05:06.974
- Social Security is...

05:07.008 --> 05:10.978
- 958-00-0493.

05:11.012 --> 05:12.046
- And you're how tall?

05:12.079 --> 05:13.514
- I'm 6'3".

05:14.615 --> 05:17.051
- Weight?
- Um, 200.

05:18.385 --> 05:19.587
- Pounds?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.755
- Yes, pounds.

05:20.788 --> 05:21.956
Is there something wrong?

05:21.989 --> 05:23.490
- No, that's fine.
I'll just put that here.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.795
Have you ever been diagnosed
with heart disease,

05:27.829 --> 05:29.130
diabetes, cancer of any kind?

05:29.163 --> 05:30.631
- Nope.

05:30.665 --> 05:31.966
- Crohn's disease, epilepsy,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.534
restless leg,
high blood pressure, pneumonia?

05:33.568 --> 05:35.736
- No, ma'am.

05:35.770 --> 05:37.138
- In the last five years,
have you been treated

05:37.171 --> 05:39.040
for alcohol
or substance use disorder?

05:39.073 --> 05:40.675
This includes
community support groups

05:40.708 --> 05:42.510
such as Alcoholics Anonymous.

05:43.678 --> 05:45.012
Are they even gonna read this?

05:45.046 --> 05:45.880
- Who?

05:47.548 --> 05:49.584
- The board.

05:49.617 --> 05:50.818
- I imagine they will, yes.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.019
- Hmm.

05:52.053 --> 05:54.522
And if I say something
they don't like,

05:54.555 --> 05:55.523
then I don't get the position?

05:55.556 --> 05:56.489
- I can't speak to that.

05:56.524 --> 05:57.658
- But in your experience?

05:57.692 --> 05:59.627
- My experience is
what you see here.

05:59.660 --> 06:00.595
I gather information,

06:00.628 --> 06:01.696
I verify it,

06:01.729 --> 06:02.930
and I produce a report.

06:02.964 --> 06:04.732
- So if I lied--
- I'd find out.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.701
- How?
- Okay, it depends.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.569
In the case of your height
and weight, I can use my eyes.

06:08.603 --> 06:10.071
You are not 6'3",

06:10.104 --> 06:11.739
and you do not weigh 200 pounds
carrying groceries.

06:11.772 --> 06:12.807
- That's funny.
- As I understand it,

06:12.840 --> 06:13.808
the board is considering you

06:13.841 --> 06:14.976
for a very high-profile--

06:15.009 --> 06:16.510
a crucial role in the company,
CEO.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.079
So no.

06:18.112 --> 06:18.779
They're not just gonna
take your word for it,

06:18.813 --> 06:20.047
if that's what you're asking.

06:20.081 --> 06:21.481
- That's fine.

06:21.515 --> 06:25.152
So, um, I guess...yes.

06:25.186 --> 06:27.922
- Yes, you have been treated
for alcohol use disorder?

06:31.458 --> 06:32.760
- Two times.

06:32.793 --> 06:34.595
- And I see
you currently drink.

06:34.629 --> 06:36.597
- Socially.

06:36.631 --> 06:39.466
- Do you abuse
prescription drugs?

06:39.499 --> 06:41.769
- Do I abuse prescription--

06:41.802 --> 06:43.037
- Is that confusing?

06:43.070 --> 06:44.972
- Well, I take
prescription drugs.

06:45.006 --> 06:46.908
I don't know
how they feel about it.

06:46.941 --> 06:49.210
- Do you use
recreational drugs?

06:49.243 --> 06:52.046
Marijuana, cocaine, MDMA,
psychedelics, heroin.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.814
- Yeah.

06:53.848 --> 06:55.216
I mean, no. Not--not heroin.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.684
Come on.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.586
- How many times?

06:58.619 --> 07:02.023
- Um, how many times
have I used recreational drugs?

07:02.056 --> 07:03.124
- Yes.

07:03.157 --> 07:04.625
- Ever?

07:04.659 --> 07:05.960
- Yes.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.128
- I mean, it's thousands.

07:07.161 --> 07:07.828
Tens of thousands.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.163
I don't know. I have no idea.

07:09.196 --> 07:10.831
- Okay, would you like me
to write that?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.533
You said I shouldn't lie.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.834
- Do you suffer from any

07:13.868 --> 07:14.969
chronic sexually transmitted
infections?

07:15.002 --> 07:17.071
HIV/AIDS,
herpes simplex B, HPV.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.773
- If you want to know that
for yourself,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.007
I'm happy to tell you about it.

07:20.041 --> 07:20.908
- It's part
of the questionnaire.

07:20.942 --> 07:22.143
- No, it's not.
- It is.

07:26.981 --> 07:28.616
Maybe you'd like me
to write all of them.

07:32.820 --> 07:33.955
Maybe you'd like me to write,

07:33.988 --> 07:36.524
"Hal Porterfield fucks
like Caligula."

07:44.932 --> 07:48.936
Hal Porterfield fucks
like Caligula.

07:53.874 --> 07:55.776
You lost your virginity
at what age?

07:59.580 --> 08:00.648
- Come on.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.183
- What?

08:02.216 --> 08:03.718
- What is this?

08:03.751 --> 08:06.520
- It's the next question.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.193
- 13.
- No.

08:12.226 --> 08:12.960
- I did.
- No.

08:12.994 --> 08:14.962
- To a camp counselor,
actually.

08:16.130 --> 08:17.598
- Hal.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.901
I swear to God,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.036
this is all gonna go
a lot faster

08:22.069 --> 08:24.071
if you just tell the truth.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.241
You've never been
anywhere close to a rehab,

08:27.274 --> 08:28.809
and you can barely sip that
whiskey without grimacing.

08:28.843 --> 08:29.844
So please stop posturing.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.212
You are embarrassing yourself.

08:31.245 --> 08:32.780
I'm gonna write that
you lost your virginity at 25,

08:32.813 --> 08:34.215
and we're gonna move on, okay?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.185
- Fine.

08:44.358 --> 08:46.060
What?

08:49.296 --> 08:50.831
- That's true, isn't it?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.737
You lost your virginity at 25?

08:56.771 --> 08:58.606
- What's the next question?

08:58.639 --> 08:59.740
- It's actually true.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.609
- What is next on your form,

09:01.642 --> 09:02.777
Miss Attorney?

09:03.844 --> 09:06.781
- That's fascinating.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.783
- What are you doing?

09:08.816 --> 09:10.051
- I...

09:11.318 --> 09:14.155
You're not ugly.

09:14.188 --> 09:17.191
There's gotta be
plenty of girls out there

09:17.224 --> 09:19.360
who brush their teeth
until all their gums come off

09:19.393 --> 09:21.662
and prepare all their meals
at the beginning of the week

09:21.695 --> 09:24.265
who'd have no problem

09:24.298 --> 09:26.700
going down on
a sweet little nothing like you

09:26.734 --> 09:27.935
with your clean ass.

09:35.176 --> 09:36.877
- Mm.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.981
Yeah.

09:43.117 --> 09:44.118
No.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.190
This--okay.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.827
This is--this isn't--
this isn't what I wanted.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.929
This--it's not in the script.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.635
- The script.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.003
- Yeah.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.672
You're supposed to ask me...
- Right.

10:04.705 --> 10:06.340
- How many times a day
I masturbate.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.275
- "I want you to tell me
in a really mean voice

10:08.309 --> 10:10.244
"that you're going to write
that I lost my virginity at 25,

10:10.277 --> 10:11.812
"and then
we're going to move on.

10:11.846 --> 10:13.147
"And then the next question is,

10:13.180 --> 10:14.248
'Hal, how many times a day
do you masturbate?'"

10:14.281 --> 10:15.850
- Right.

10:15.883 --> 10:18.152
And then this stuff
about my cock.

10:18.185 --> 10:20.287
- Right, I see that. Yeah.
- Right.

10:20.321 --> 10:22.790
So that's what
I want you to say.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.291
So--so what's the problem
exactly?

10:24.325 --> 10:25.659
- You want me to stick
to your script?

10:25.693 --> 10:26.760
- I do.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.095
Yeah, you were doing great.

10:28.129 --> 10:29.697
You just don't have to add
all the other stuff.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.332
I wrote it out so you'd know
exactly what to say.

10:31.365 --> 10:32.266
- Got it.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.769
The man knows what he wants.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.371
- Exactly.

10:37.404 --> 10:40.040
- And I'm all about
customer service.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.142
- Love hearing that.

10:44.178 --> 10:45.346
- I just...

10:45.379 --> 10:46.280
- What?

10:49.049 --> 10:50.417
- Can I say one thing
before we dive back in?

10:50.451 --> 10:52.286
- Sure.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.754
- I can tell that you put
a lot of thought into this,

10:53.787 --> 10:55.022
and I don't want to diminish

10:55.055 --> 10:55.756
all the great work
that you've done.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.724
- Oh, thanks.
No, that's fine.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.192
If you just read the script--
- Excuse me.

11:00.427 --> 11:01.729
I'm speaking.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.063
- Okay.

11:03.097 --> 11:05.232
- The service that I offer
is very specific.

11:05.266 --> 11:06.967
And as I said in my email--
- I read the email.

11:07.001 --> 11:07.536
I'm not breaking
any of the rules.

11:07.569 --> 11:08.869
We're not gonna touch.

11:08.903 --> 11:09.870
- It's not about the rules
exactly.

11:09.904 --> 11:11.172
It's--
- I get it.

11:11.205 --> 11:12.006
There's no touching.
That makes it hotter.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.341
Actually, I'm on board--
- Hal. Hal!

11:16.410 --> 11:17.945
I need some quiet.

11:26.453 --> 11:29.924
It's not about the rules,

11:29.957 --> 11:31.859
and it's not about
what arouses you.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.895
That's, like, incidental.

11:37.031 --> 11:40.000
The reason
that I don't touch my clients

11:40.034 --> 11:41.869
and that they don't touch me...

11:46.373 --> 11:49.777
Is that what they need from me
is not physical.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.187
It's mental.

12:00.221 --> 12:01.222
- Yeah.

12:01.255 --> 12:02.957
And all this, it's mental.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.124
I'm saying it's better--

12:04.158 --> 12:05.326
- And I am saying
that this might be

12:05.359 --> 12:06.460
what you think that you want,

12:06.493 --> 12:08.762
but respectfully,
you have no idea.

12:13.200 --> 12:17.505
I am saying that if
I held a gun to your head,

12:17.539 --> 12:20.474
you couldn't tell me what it is
that you really want.

12:20.508 --> 12:21.610
- All right. All right.

12:21.643 --> 12:24.011
I guess we should just
figure out how much I owe you,

12:24.044 --> 12:24.979
'cause this isn't--

12:25.012 --> 12:27.014
- Don't do that.

12:27.047 --> 12:32.286
Don't sigh and roll your eyes
like you're fucking retarded.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.788
What am I feeling right now
about you, huh?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.992
- I don't know.

12:40.361 --> 12:43.330
- Well...

12:43.364 --> 12:45.399
how about you think
for a second before you speak?

12:47.602 --> 12:49.336
Have you ever tried that?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.407
- You're disappointed in me?

12:57.111 --> 12:58.445
I am.
- Mm-hmm.

13:00.314 --> 13:02.550
Mm.

13:02.584 --> 13:04.184
- You're not as stupid
as you look.

13:07.121 --> 13:09.390
- Do you want to make me
less disappointed?

13:13.060 --> 13:14.862
- What can I do?

13:20.200 --> 13:23.070
- Don't ask questions.

13:29.577 --> 13:32.313
This is a nice place.

13:32.346 --> 13:33.881
- Thanks.

13:44.925 --> 13:46.360
- Show me the bathroom.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.956
Is this it?

14:15.989 --> 14:17.124
- Mm-hmm.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.468
This needs to be cleaned.

14:34.274 --> 14:35.943
- Are you gonna clean it?

14:40.515 --> 14:41.949
- Okay.

15:04.037 --> 15:05.172
- You're gonna clean
the bathroom

15:05.205 --> 15:07.174
by fucking up
the beautiful hand towels?

15:09.376 --> 15:10.678
Try thinking.

15:13.548 --> 15:15.315
Attaboy.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.559
Is it dirty?

15:27.529 --> 15:29.363
- Um...

15:29.396 --> 15:32.499
- Is the counter dirty, Hal?

15:34.134 --> 15:36.538
It's all pretty clean, I think.

15:36.571 --> 15:37.705
- Stop.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.709
Look at me.

15:45.078 --> 15:48.182
It's not all clean.

15:48.215 --> 15:51.318
There's dirt.

15:51.351 --> 15:55.022
You're just too lazy and sloppy
to find it.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.493
Do you need help?

16:02.296 --> 16:03.731
- Yes.

16:05.767 --> 16:08.101
- Then ask for it.

16:09.671 --> 16:11.739
- Will you help me
clean the bathroom?

16:11.773 --> 16:14.642
- Sure.

16:14.676 --> 16:17.712
You can start by
getting on the floor.

16:21.281 --> 16:24.384
Hal, you're gonna ruin
your clothes.

16:29.122 --> 16:30.692
- I should take them off?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.729
- What the fuck do you think?

16:55.617 --> 16:57.150
Look at you.

16:59.521 --> 17:02.189
Barely cast a shadow.

17:19.874 --> 17:21.609
Crawl to the toilet.

17:28.516 --> 17:32.620
I want you to clean
behind the toilet.

17:34.388 --> 17:37.324
That's where the dirt is.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.536
Hal.

17:48.570 --> 17:51.506
- Yes?

17:51.539 --> 17:54.341
- When you think of yourself,
what do you see?

17:56.711 --> 17:59.714
Is it something like garbage?

17:59.747 --> 18:02.482
- No.

18:02.517 --> 18:04.451
- I think it's like
a small white bag

18:04.484 --> 18:05.787
of rotten food
and snotted tissue

18:05.820 --> 18:07.789
and broken glass.

18:07.822 --> 18:09.591
- No.

18:09.624 --> 18:12.827
- Maybe like a mound
in the corner of a landfill?

18:12.860 --> 18:14.428
The slime that comes
out of the bottom?

18:14.461 --> 18:15.763
The shit that just sits there

18:15.797 --> 18:16.764
that the Earth
won't even take,

18:16.798 --> 18:18.900
not for one million years?

18:40.655 --> 18:43.457
This is very clean.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.792
- Thank you.

18:47.629 --> 18:49.429
- You might've earned a treat.

18:51.766 --> 18:53.601
Are you excited?

18:55.603 --> 18:58.706
You are?

18:58.740 --> 19:00.474
Okay.

19:00.508 --> 19:02.409
You can show me.

19:16.356 --> 19:18.191
Do you want to come?

19:24.999 --> 19:27.200
Are you thinking about
what I want to hear?

19:27.234 --> 19:28.870
- Yes.

19:28.903 --> 19:30.337
- Well, stop.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.939
Do you want to come or not?

19:34.241 --> 19:37.344
- Yes.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.814
- Then ask me.

19:39.847 --> 19:41.214
- Can I come?

19:41.248 --> 19:42.349
- No.
- Please?

19:42.382 --> 19:44.852
- No!

19:44.886 --> 19:46.253
You can jerk off,
but if you come,

19:46.286 --> 19:47.220
I'll ruin your fucking life.

19:47.254 --> 19:47.989
Is that clear?

19:48.022 --> 19:49.322
- Oh, yes.

19:51.358 --> 19:52.492
- Go ahead.

20:09.544 --> 20:10.845
- How's it going over there?

20:12.345 --> 20:13.514
- Good.

20:15.850 --> 20:17.685
- Stop for a second.

20:20.855 --> 20:21.889
- Don't look at me.

20:23.057 --> 20:24.759
Sorry.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.027
- If you come without
my permission, Hal, that is it.

20:26.060 --> 20:26.994
I swear to God.

20:31.465 --> 20:33.366
You can do a little more.

20:56.691 --> 20:58.391
You know what you actually are?

21:01.763 --> 21:03.396
It's like...

21:03.430 --> 21:04.899
imagine something that exists,

21:04.932 --> 21:06.901
like a bright red apple.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.403
Now imagine that it's gone.

21:12.106 --> 21:14.609
That is you.

21:14.642 --> 21:17.545
You aren't anything.

21:17.578 --> 21:20.548
You don't even take up space.

21:20.581 --> 21:21.516
- Oh, fuck.

21:23.618 --> 21:24.752
Okay.
- Okay.

21:24.786 --> 21:25.920
- I need to.
- You need to?

21:25.953 --> 21:26.854
- Yeah, is it okay?
- You need to?

21:26.888 --> 21:27.420
- Is it okay?

21:27.454 --> 21:29.891
- Do you need to come?

21:29.924 --> 21:31.491
No. It's not okay.

21:31.526 --> 21:32.627
Stop. Take your hand away.

21:32.660 --> 21:33.795
Take your hand away.

21:38.766 --> 21:40.034
- Hal.

21:41.903 --> 21:43.436
Hal, look at me.

21:49.844 --> 21:51.612
You can't touch yourself,

21:51.646 --> 21:53.781
but you can come now.

21:56.050 --> 21:58.385
You have my permission.

22:15.937 --> 22:18.606
- I know what you need
because you're mine.

22:23.578 --> 22:26.514
I know everything about you.

24:19.560 --> 24:21.195
- Ribeye, two martinis,

24:21.228 --> 24:23.998
a bottle of Montepulciano,
and a hot fudge sundae.

24:24.031 --> 24:25.733
- Perfect. Thanks, Julian.

24:25.766 --> 24:26.834
I can take it from here.
- Great.

24:26.867 --> 24:28.102
Oh, and it's Paul.

24:28.135 --> 24:30.504
- Oh, is it? Sorry about that.

24:52.560 --> 24:53.260
You're incredible.

24:53.294 --> 24:54.662
You know that?

24:58.165 --> 24:59.667
- It takes two.

25:13.347 --> 25:15.216
What?

25:15.249 --> 25:18.185
- Mm, nothing.
I like watching you eat.

25:18.219 --> 25:19.553
- It's 'cause you're a pervert.

25:24.959 --> 25:26.594
I really liked that scene.

25:26.627 --> 25:27.728
- Yeah?

25:27.762 --> 25:28.896
What'd you like about it?

25:31.032 --> 25:33.601
- How committed you were.

25:33.634 --> 25:34.902
How much it meant to you.

25:37.038 --> 25:39.707
It's exciting to me
when it gets like that.

25:39.740 --> 25:41.242
- Yeah, for me too.

25:41.275 --> 25:46.213
- The part about my work,
how it's mental, not physical.

25:46.247 --> 25:48.783
- Well, you said that to me
at our first session.

25:48.816 --> 25:49.617
Remember?
- Of course.

25:49.650 --> 25:51.786
- Yeah.

25:51.819 --> 25:53.087
- I thought it was interesting,

25:53.120 --> 25:54.889
you bringing in
the real-life stuff.

25:54.922 --> 25:57.291
- Real life?

25:57.324 --> 25:58.793
- Your dad's passing

25:58.826 --> 26:00.761
and your new role
at the company.

26:00.795 --> 26:02.797
How are you doing?

26:02.830 --> 26:03.831
I mean, this must be so--

26:03.864 --> 26:04.999
- Yeah, uh, no.

26:05.032 --> 26:09.136
It's been, uh,
a lot to process.

26:09.170 --> 26:11.138
And I've been dealing
with the inheritance

26:11.172 --> 26:15.076
and people coming
out of the woodwork.

26:15.109 --> 26:16.644
I just keep wanting
to turn to him

26:16.677 --> 26:18.279
because I'm expecting
some joke or...

26:20.381 --> 26:21.882
I just miss him.

26:24.251 --> 26:26.687
Yeah.

26:26.720 --> 26:28.989
He was a fearless--

26:29.023 --> 26:30.624
he was an asshole.

26:32.226 --> 26:35.863
You know, but I've never met
anyone like him.

26:35.896 --> 26:37.998
Mm.

26:38.032 --> 26:39.967
- It sounds really,
really tough.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.036
- Mm. How do you know
about all this?

26:42.069 --> 26:45.306
- Well, when your dad passed,
there was an article I read,

26:45.339 --> 26:48.142
and it said that you were
his presumptive successor.

26:48.175 --> 26:49.844
So--
- No, I am--

26:49.877 --> 26:51.679
I am his successor.
That's the plan.

26:51.712 --> 26:54.248
- Presumptive successor, right?

26:54.281 --> 26:56.317
- Oh, right.

26:56.350 --> 26:57.852
Right.

26:57.885 --> 27:00.121
Yeah, no, this has been, um...

27:00.154 --> 27:01.255
expected of me, really.

27:01.288 --> 27:04.859
It's my--I mean, my whole life,

27:04.892 --> 27:06.861
and basically,
just been waiting

27:06.894 --> 27:09.930
for this moment for years.

27:09.964 --> 27:11.732
- It's such a big deal, right?

27:11.765 --> 27:13.267
- I was actually gonna say
the opposite

27:13.300 --> 27:15.436
because this has been part
of the plan for so long.

27:15.469 --> 27:19.373
I mean, I guess there's
a few kind of small things

27:19.406 --> 27:20.774
to get sorted out.

27:20.808 --> 27:22.376
- The board?
- The board?

27:22.409 --> 27:24.945
- Well, I noticed in the scene,

27:24.979 --> 27:27.348
um, you had the board

27:27.381 --> 27:30.384
as this looming threat
hanging over you.

27:30.417 --> 27:32.853
- Right.

27:32.887 --> 27:36.757
That's interesting
that you would think that.

27:36.790 --> 27:40.327
But the thing is,
we don't have a board.

27:42.163 --> 27:43.731
- Oh.

27:43.764 --> 27:45.299
- I think I got something
stuck in my...

27:46.467 --> 27:48.035
- I just thought
every public company

27:48.068 --> 27:49.837
had a board of directors.

27:49.870 --> 27:50.905
- We don't.

27:50.938 --> 27:53.073
That's not how
we're structured.

27:54.775 --> 27:56.076
- Oh.

27:56.110 --> 27:57.878
- But anyway, listen.

27:57.912 --> 28:00.214
Um, I got something for you.

28:14.461 --> 28:15.296
- What is it?

28:15.329 --> 28:16.964
Open it.

28:22.036 --> 28:23.137
- Do you like it?

28:23.170 --> 28:24.838
- Fucking God. I mean...

28:26.874 --> 28:30.144
- It's a, um, Audemars Piguet.

28:30.177 --> 28:33.113
You know what that is?

28:33.147 --> 28:35.482
It's, like, one of the nicest
watches in the world.

28:38.419 --> 28:41.021
- I--I just don't--

28:41.055 --> 28:42.790
I don't--
I don't know what to say.

28:42.823 --> 28:45.459
- Don't. Just try it on.

28:45.492 --> 28:46.894
Just look at it.

28:53.100 --> 28:54.301
Yeah, it's the right color.

28:58.038 --> 29:02.910
Um, maybe
you already know this,

29:02.943 --> 29:06.146
but what you do,

29:06.180 --> 29:08.215
your work,

29:08.249 --> 29:11.352
it's incredibly valuable,

29:11.385 --> 29:15.322
and it's made a big difference
in my life.

29:15.356 --> 29:19.527
I don't know how to thank you,
so yeah.

29:19.561 --> 29:21.095
- This is a start.

29:21.128 --> 29:22.363
- I'm glad.

29:26.133 --> 29:29.003
It's gonna be so weird
to not have this

29:29.036 --> 29:31.005
as part of my routine anymore.

29:31.038 --> 29:34.141
I'm a little worried, actually.

29:34.174 --> 29:35.476
- What do you mean?

29:35.510 --> 29:37.512
- Well, just, you know,
what I said, it's--

29:37.545 --> 29:41.215
how it's been
so helpful for me.

29:42.584 --> 29:45.019
- Yeah, well--
but why wouldn't it be

29:45.052 --> 29:48.022
a part of your routine?

29:48.055 --> 29:51.158
- Isn't this why you brought up
the stuff about the company?

29:51.191 --> 29:52.560
I thought you understood.

29:52.594 --> 29:54.328
- Understood? No.

29:58.399 --> 30:02.269
- I've been thinking that this
is probably not a good idea--

30:02.303 --> 30:04.539
well, in fact,
I know it's not--

30:04.572 --> 30:07.241
for us--

30:07.274 --> 30:13.914
for me to keep doing this...
with you.

30:13.947 --> 30:15.282
- Mm.

30:17.084 --> 30:18.520
May I ask why?

30:18.553 --> 30:20.220
- I mean, you said it yourself.

30:20.254 --> 30:22.056
You know,
this job and everything,

30:22.089 --> 30:23.390
it's a really big deal.

30:23.424 --> 30:26.193
And I--if I'm gonna do this,
I'm...

30:29.963 --> 30:34.234
I need to match up
my insides with my outsides

30:34.268 --> 30:37.572
and be a person
that I want people to see,

30:37.605 --> 30:40.007
a person who wins.

30:41.442 --> 30:43.377
A person who wins?

30:43.410 --> 30:47.214
What we do in here,
it's so meaningful.

30:47.247 --> 30:49.917
- Mm.
- But it's just not something

30:49.950 --> 30:54.589
that goes with
the next stage of my life.

30:54.622 --> 30:56.290
Does that make sense?
- Sure.

30:56.323 --> 30:58.425
- I thought the watch
would kind of communicate this

30:58.459 --> 31:01.028
better than--
- Oh. Oh. No. I get it.

31:01.061 --> 31:03.130
Um, it was like
a retirement gift.

31:04.431 --> 31:06.967
Like I'm--like I'm a cop
or something.

31:07.000 --> 31:07.968
- A cop?

31:09.571 --> 31:10.971
- I should go.

31:13.608 --> 31:15.976
- I'll walk you down.

31:16.009 --> 31:17.444
- Walk me down?

31:17.478 --> 31:18.646
- Yeah.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.114
- No.

31:20.147 --> 31:22.249
No.

31:22.282 --> 31:23.518
Goodbye here, please.

31:25.720 --> 31:28.188
- I'm--I'm really gonna
miss this.

31:28.222 --> 31:29.990
I--I hope you believe me.

31:38.031 --> 31:40.300
Hey. Wait.

31:40.334 --> 31:44.138
Do you--you--
you don't want this?

31:50.043 --> 31:51.979
- Pleasure doing business.

33:31.813 --> 33:33.681
- Um, I don't have
a strong opinion,

33:33.715 --> 33:36.718
so I'm saying
whatever you think is best is--

33:36.751 --> 33:38.686
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.522
- There's one more thing.
- Okay.

33:40.555 --> 33:42.122
- Can I come back in?

33:42.155 --> 33:44.458
- Hey, can I call you back?
Someone's here.

33:44.491 --> 33:46.561
Because I'm not a flowers guy.

33:46.594 --> 33:48.328
No, I do care,

33:48.362 --> 33:50.264
but can we just talk
about this in a little bit?

33:50.297 --> 33:51.799
You too.

33:51.833 --> 33:52.767
What are you doing?
- Who was that?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.769
- Uh, nobody. It's--

33:54.802 --> 33:55.603
- Didn't sound like nobody.

33:55.637 --> 33:57.437
She wants you
to pick out flowers.

33:57.471 --> 33:59.239
What did--what did you need?

34:05.345 --> 34:07.381
- "The first thing

34:07.414 --> 34:09.684
"and the hardest thing
in business

34:09.717 --> 34:13.053
is to know who you are."

34:14.354 --> 34:18.392
"So before I give
a presentation,

34:18.425 --> 34:20.528
"before I walk into a meeting,

34:20.562 --> 34:24.431
"before I sit down
for a cup of coffee,

34:24.464 --> 34:26.768
I always do the same thing."

34:30.137 --> 34:32.339
"I match up my insides
with my outsides."

34:32.372 --> 34:33.741
- You read my dad's book.
Congratulations.

34:33.775 --> 34:35.810
- "I remember that while
there are lucky strokes

34:35.843 --> 34:38.378
"and setbacks in life,

34:38.412 --> 34:40.682
"over any considerable
period of time,

34:40.715 --> 34:42.717
"the truth becomes clear.

34:42.750 --> 34:47.254
"There are those who win
and those who don't,

34:47.287 --> 34:48.590
"and I remember that

34:48.623 --> 34:51.559
I have answered that question
for myself."

34:53.761 --> 34:59.867
"I am a person...who wins."

34:59.901 --> 35:02.804
- Thank you for that.

35:02.837 --> 35:06.473
- You couldn't even fire me
without stealing from him.

35:06.507 --> 35:07.742
- I mean, come on.

35:07.775 --> 35:09.443
Obviously,
I've learned things from him.

35:09.476 --> 35:11.278
- That's not
what I'm talking about.

35:13.514 --> 35:14.916
I want to know something.

35:14.949 --> 35:16.618
Which is it?

35:16.651 --> 35:18.485
- Which is what?

35:18.519 --> 35:21.789
- Do you tend to win
or do the other thing?

35:21.823 --> 35:24.659
- Do you want me to acknowledge
that I have been lucky,

35:24.692 --> 35:26.794
that I have had it better
than most people?

35:26.828 --> 35:28.462
I will. So--
- Answer the question.

35:28.495 --> 35:29.731
- I don't feel like doing that.

35:29.764 --> 35:31.498
- Well, what did
your father think?

35:31.532 --> 35:33.266
- Judging by the fact that he
left me the company, I mean--

35:33.300 --> 35:34.502
- We know
that's what he wanted.

35:34.535 --> 35:36.804
I'm asking
what he thought of you.

35:36.838 --> 35:38.506
- Listen, this is
completely inappropriate,

35:38.539 --> 35:39.774
and it's weird
what you're doing.

35:39.807 --> 35:41.274
- Okay, so we've established
what he thought.

35:41.308 --> 35:43.276
You tend to lose.

35:43.310 --> 35:45.178
- And what about you?
- Me?

35:45.212 --> 35:47.481
- Yeah, you--
you know, deep down,

35:47.515 --> 35:49.550
without any doubt
that you're a winner?

35:49.584 --> 35:51.318
You can say that
about yourself?

35:53.286 --> 35:54.789
- The first time that
I went to the dentist,

35:54.822 --> 35:57.290
I was 19 years old.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.593
- Okay.

35:58.626 --> 35:59.761
- He took one look
inside of my mouth,

35:59.794 --> 36:01.929
and do you know what he said?

36:01.963 --> 36:03.698
- No.

36:03.731 --> 36:06.199
- He said, "Perfect."

36:06.233 --> 36:08.335
He said, "A plus."

36:08.368 --> 36:09.637
I did that--me--

36:09.671 --> 36:10.805
because nobody else
gave a flying fuck.

36:10.838 --> 36:12.339
That is who I am.

36:15.943 --> 36:18.345
- Okay, it doesn't matter
what my father thought.

36:18.378 --> 36:20.515
I am in this position,
and I can say with confidence

36:20.548 --> 36:21.949
that I can do this job.

36:21.983 --> 36:24.552
I know what it takes.
I am--I am prepared.

36:24.585 --> 36:26.854
That is all that matters.
- Mm.

36:26.888 --> 36:28.488
I believe you
when you say that.

36:30.024 --> 36:30.925
- Because?

36:30.958 --> 36:31.993
- Why?

36:32.026 --> 36:33.293
- I do believe it.

36:33.326 --> 36:35.530
- Yeah. Why?

36:35.563 --> 36:38.465
- Why what?

36:38.498 --> 36:41.536
- Your dad didn't believe
you could.

36:41.569 --> 36:44.839
Where did you get the idea,
the gall,

36:44.872 --> 36:46.674
to think that
you could step into

36:46.708 --> 36:51.478
his huge, old, priceless shoes?

36:58.385 --> 36:59.887
From me.

37:01.856 --> 37:07.662
You would be unfit
if it were not for me.

37:07.695 --> 37:09.463
- What are you talking about?

37:09.496 --> 37:11.966
- I'm saying your new job,

37:11.999 --> 37:15.402
you wouldn't be able to do it
without what I taught you.

37:15.435 --> 37:17.404
- What you taught me?

37:17.437 --> 37:18.506
- Yes.

37:18.539 --> 37:20.273
- I--but, you know,

37:20.307 --> 37:22.610
what we do here, it's for fun.

37:22.643 --> 37:24.912
It's not, you know--

37:24.946 --> 37:25.913
- What?

37:25.947 --> 37:26.848
- Real.

37:28.082 --> 37:29.449
- Hal.

37:29.483 --> 37:30.952
- It's not.

37:30.985 --> 37:32.820
It has nothing to do
with the real world,

37:32.854 --> 37:33.921
and that is what I love
about it.

37:33.955 --> 37:36.791
- You don't look it,
but you really are so stupid.

37:36.824 --> 37:37.859
- I don't want to play
right now.

37:37.892 --> 37:39.927
- I'm not.

37:39.961 --> 37:41.729
- So what do you think
you taught me?

37:41.763 --> 37:43.396
- You know.
- I don't.

37:44.932 --> 37:45.833
Confidence.

37:45.867 --> 37:48.335
- By doing everything
you tell me to do?

37:48.368 --> 37:49.837
By submitting to you,
that taught me confidence?

37:49.871 --> 37:51.072
- Okay,
when you first emailed me,

37:51.105 --> 37:52.507
when we first met,
you were like this.

37:52.540 --> 37:54.075
You were like this.
Meh-meh-meh-meh.

37:54.108 --> 37:56.010
And you could barely speak.

37:56.043 --> 37:57.444
Now look at you.

37:57.477 --> 37:59.614
Look at you.

37:59.647 --> 38:01.048
You write me a script
and you tell me

38:01.082 --> 38:03.985
exactly what I should say
and exactly what I should do.

38:05.753 --> 38:06.988
You don't even fucking know
what happened.

38:07.021 --> 38:08.823
I taught you how to ask
for what you want.

38:08.856 --> 38:10.525
You couldn't do that
before you met me.

38:10.558 --> 38:11.659
- I thanked you.

38:11.692 --> 38:13.027
And I meant it.

38:13.060 --> 38:16.531
And if I have been
disrespectful in any way,

38:16.564 --> 38:17.632
then I apologize.

38:17.665 --> 38:18.900
- An apology?

38:18.933 --> 38:20.635
What am I supposed to do
with that?

38:21.669 --> 38:23.704
- Okay. I also--

38:23.738 --> 38:26.007
I got you a gift also,
by the way.

38:26.040 --> 38:27.875
- The watch?

38:29.577 --> 38:30.678
- Yeah, the...

38:30.711 --> 38:34.515
- This is what, um, $15,000?

38:34.549 --> 38:36.517
$17,000?

38:36.551 --> 38:37.985
- $32,000.

38:39.153 --> 38:42.389
- $32,000?

38:42.422 --> 38:45.893
You own 112 hotels.

38:45.927 --> 38:49.697
Your market cap
is $185 million.

38:49.730 --> 38:53.534
What is $32,000
compared to what you have?

38:53.568 --> 38:54.702
You want to talk about

38:54.735 --> 38:56.637
matching up your insides
to your outsides?

38:56.671 --> 38:57.905
Do you want to talk about

38:57.939 --> 38:59.674
who around here knows
what it takes to win?

39:02.810 --> 39:04.612
- Okay, what do you want?

39:04.645 --> 39:07.380
- I want what I'm worth
relative to what you have.

39:07.414 --> 39:08.749
A real number.

39:08.783 --> 39:10.685
- I don't--what does that mean?

39:10.718 --> 39:11.953
- Half.
- Half?

39:11.986 --> 39:13.420
- Half of the salary
for the first year

39:13.453 --> 39:14.454
of the job that I got you.

39:14.487 --> 39:15.890
You how much is that?

39:15.923 --> 39:17.725
- That's, like, $4 million.

39:18.926 --> 39:21.028
- Okay, good.
- Oh, is that good?

39:21.062 --> 39:22.730
You're insane.

39:23.598 --> 39:25.432
- It's what I deserve.
- No, I'm not doing that.

39:25.465 --> 39:26.734
And I don't think I could
do that even if I wanted to.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.069
- Yes, you are.

39:28.102 --> 39:29.436
You are doing it.

39:29.469 --> 39:31.572
- Or what, you fucking nutjob?

39:31.606 --> 39:34.609
- Or I'll tell.

39:45.485 --> 39:48.956
- Okay.

39:48.990 --> 39:50.490
Like, can we just slow down
for a second?

39:50.524 --> 39:51.525
- I'm dead serious.

39:51.559 --> 39:52.627
- I can see that.

39:52.660 --> 39:53.928
- So what's your answer?

39:53.961 --> 39:55.428
- What, to your offer
of blackmail?

39:55.462 --> 39:56.163
I'm gonna pass.

39:57.965 --> 39:59.100
- People are watching
your company right now.

39:59.133 --> 40:00.768
This transition,
it would be a story.

40:00.801 --> 40:02.469
"Heir to hotel fortune
shoves cotton swab

40:02.503 --> 40:03.871
"into own penis when commanded.

40:03.905 --> 40:05.907
Denver dominatrix tells all."

40:05.940 --> 40:07.875
- See, to me,
that doesn't quite have

40:07.909 --> 40:08.943
the air
of hard-hitting journalism.

40:08.976 --> 40:11.444
- Okay. how about,
"CEO material Hal Porterfield

40:11.478 --> 40:12.947
"paid a woman to spit on him
and call him

40:12.980 --> 40:14.916
a racist pervert
with a huge, useless dick."

40:14.949 --> 40:15.583
- I don't--
what do those two things

40:15.616 --> 40:16.951
have to do with each other?

40:16.984 --> 40:18.886
- "In an email obtained,
Porterfield seeks

40:18.920 --> 40:20.087
"to clarify that
the woman of question

40:20.121 --> 40:23.124
"is of pure
Ashkenazi Jew descent,

40:23.157 --> 40:25.458
"going so far as to obtain
a saliva sample

40:25.492 --> 40:28.162
"so that he could perform
a genetic test.

40:28.195 --> 40:30.932
"She later read the results
of the test aloud to him

40:30.965 --> 40:32.733
"while he milked himself
into a loofah

40:32.767 --> 40:36.604
that he claimed was taken
from his own mother's shower."

40:39.941 --> 40:41.609
Well, I mean,
when you say it like that,

40:41.642 --> 40:43.244
it makes it sound weird.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.712
- Why are you smiling?

40:44.745 --> 40:46.981
- Because this isn't the 1990s,

40:47.014 --> 40:49.250
and no one cares
what I do with my money

40:49.283 --> 40:52.653
or what I shove in my dick
on my own time, okay?

40:52.687 --> 40:55.723
If anything, it's gonna make me
seem open-minded and clued in

40:55.756 --> 40:58.993
and fucking cool.

40:59.026 --> 41:00.995
- The board is gonna think
this is cool?

41:01.028 --> 41:02.163
- It doesn't matter
what the board thinks.

41:02.196 --> 41:03.764
- Ha!
- It's set up already.

41:03.798 --> 41:05.066
- I knew it, you fucking idiot.

41:05.099 --> 41:06.968
You said that
you didn't have a board.

41:07.001 --> 41:09.103
You said that's not how
you're structured.

41:09.136 --> 41:10.805
- No, what I--what I meant
was we have a--

41:10.838 --> 41:12.506
- No, I know what you meant.

41:12.540 --> 41:13.708
I know what you meant.

41:13.741 --> 41:14.842
You wanted me to feel stupid

41:14.875 --> 41:16.844
and out of my depth,
but I'm not.

41:16.877 --> 41:19.714
So this board, which exists,

41:19.747 --> 41:21.282
do they know
your company's motto?

41:21.315 --> 41:22.850
- Do they what?

41:22.883 --> 41:24.585
- Do you know
your company's motto?

41:24.618 --> 41:25.853
- Uh, yes.

41:25.886 --> 41:26.988
"Some things never change."

41:27.021 --> 41:30.992
Some things never change.

41:31.025 --> 41:34.628
Nothing weird,
nothing unexpected

41:34.662 --> 41:37.164
is gonna happen here.

41:37.198 --> 41:39.533
So how is that gonna square
with you paying

41:39.567 --> 41:41.869
for degenerate no-contact sex?

41:41.902 --> 41:44.038
- So I'll change the motto.

41:44.071 --> 41:45.973
- Mm, change the motto
"Some things never change."

41:46.007 --> 41:47.308
- Yes, and I promise,

41:47.341 --> 41:49.643
no one on the board
is gonna say a thing.

41:49.677 --> 41:51.178
- Fine.

41:51.212 --> 41:53.114
Do you want to settle this
really quickly?

41:53.147 --> 41:54.548
You don't care
what anybody thinks,

41:54.582 --> 41:55.683
and I can tell anybody
that I would like to?

41:55.716 --> 41:57.184
- That's right.
- Okay.

41:57.218 --> 41:57.818
So then let's send a video
of what we do here

41:57.852 --> 41:59.553
to everybody on the board.

42:00.755 --> 42:02.757
- That's, um...

42:02.790 --> 42:04.558
not how blackmail works.

42:04.592 --> 42:06.560
- No?
- No.

42:06.594 --> 42:07.928
You don't ask for money

42:07.962 --> 42:09.730
and then propose to make
a dirty video.

42:09.764 --> 42:10.898
You want to try to go ahead

42:10.931 --> 42:12.800
and make that
dirty video first.

42:14.802 --> 42:16.003
Hi. I'm not quite done.

42:16.037 --> 42:17.338
Can we talk about this
in a little bit?

42:17.371 --> 42:19.774
It's just something.

42:19.807 --> 42:20.674
I'm not being difficult.

42:20.708 --> 42:21.675
I told you already.

42:21.709 --> 42:22.910
Something came up.

42:56.143 --> 42:58.712
No, because I just don't see
the urgency in it.

43:01.248 --> 43:02.283
- Hal.

43:05.019 --> 43:07.288
That's what I did.

43:09.790 --> 43:11.759
I already made a video.

43:18.899 --> 43:20.868
- I'm saying no.

43:20.901 --> 43:22.303
Hey, can you listen to me?

43:22.336 --> 43:24.972
I trust your opinion,
and I trust your taste.

43:25.005 --> 43:27.174
So, you know,
if you like the cake,

43:27.208 --> 43:29.210
then obviously,
I'm gonna like it too.

43:29.243 --> 43:30.778
- There's a camera hidden
in this hotel suite,

43:30.811 --> 43:33.080
and I have hours of footage.

43:33.114 --> 43:34.849
You can hear what we're saying.

43:34.882 --> 43:37.017
You can see your face.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.120
You can see everything.

43:40.421 --> 43:42.022
- Uh...

43:42.056 --> 43:42.823
- She really should know.
She ought to know

43:42.857 --> 43:44.258
what kind of man
she's marrying.

43:44.291 --> 43:46.694
- Oh, Mom, will you please
just listen to me?

43:46.727 --> 43:48.095
All I'm saying is I just need
a couple minutes,

43:48.129 --> 43:49.029
and then we can talk about it.

43:49.063 --> 43:50.164
- It's your mother.

43:50.197 --> 43:52.333
- Okay.
Well, I'm sorry I yelled.

43:52.366 --> 43:53.667
I just needed--

43:53.701 --> 43:55.035
okay.

43:56.270 --> 43:57.838
Yes. Bye.

44:00.040 --> 44:03.744
It's a, um, dinner for my, uh--

44:03.777 --> 44:05.079
- Your ascension.

44:09.950 --> 44:10.751
What do you think
she's gonna say

44:10.784 --> 44:12.186
when she sees it?

44:16.423 --> 44:17.925
- You're a fucking liar.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.362
- I'm not.

44:26.734 --> 44:28.903
- Tell me you're kidding.

44:30.938 --> 44:32.706
You hid a camera in here?

44:39.280 --> 44:41.749
You filmed our sessions
secretly?

45:16.016 --> 45:17.851
- Show me the camera.

45:21.488 --> 45:23.857
Rebecca...

45:23.891 --> 45:26.327
Where is the fucking camera?

45:26.360 --> 45:28.996
- If you want to see it so bad,
then fucking find it.

45:44.445 --> 45:45.913
- Cold.

45:50.417 --> 45:52.419
- I said cold.

45:58.959 --> 46:00.494
- Hey, Hal,
do you not understand

46:00.528 --> 46:01.895
how this game works?

46:08.503 --> 46:09.571
- Whoo!

46:21.215 --> 46:22.550
- There we go.

46:23.851 --> 46:25.352
- There we go. Warmer.

46:29.056 --> 46:30.558
- Warmer.

46:30.592 --> 46:33.093
You're warming up now.

46:44.071 --> 46:45.172
- What are you doing?

46:45.205 --> 46:46.373
You're losing momentum.

46:46.407 --> 46:47.975
Weather's not changing,
my friend.

46:49.443 --> 46:51.345
- Warmer.

46:51.378 --> 46:53.548
The sun is up.

46:53.581 --> 46:55.382
Can you feel it?

47:01.121 --> 47:02.289
- I'm not sure how
there'd be a camera in there,

47:02.323 --> 47:04.526
but I like your energy.

47:04.559 --> 47:05.893
Okay.

47:05.926 --> 47:07.428
Back to the lamp idea.

47:07.461 --> 47:08.630
Warmer-ish.

47:08.663 --> 47:10.397
Whoo!

47:12.032 --> 47:16.403
- Hal, imagine how satisfied
that board is gonna be.

47:16.437 --> 47:18.906
Everything that
they suspected about you,

47:18.939 --> 47:20.608
it's true.

47:20.642 --> 47:21.609
You're a fuckup.

47:21.643 --> 47:22.976
You're a clown.

47:23.010 --> 47:24.144
- Yeah.

47:24.178 --> 47:26.246
But I'll still be me,

47:26.280 --> 47:28.148
and you'll still be you,

47:28.182 --> 47:29.983
doing your own laundry,

47:30.017 --> 47:32.953
on your knees,
scrubbing your own toilet,

47:32.986 --> 47:35.657
Sunday nights in the bathtub
eating vegan ice cream

47:35.690 --> 47:39.426
because you're fucking
lactose intolerant.

47:39.460 --> 47:40.928
- Colder.

47:43.598 --> 47:45.466
- TV.
That's gotta be it, right?

47:48.603 --> 47:50.471
- You're right.

47:50.505 --> 47:54.308
I do scrub my own toilet,
and I don't like it.

47:54.341 --> 47:55.610
But you want to know
what the real difference

47:55.643 --> 47:57.077
between me and you is?

47:57.111 --> 47:59.446
- Yeah, I just told you,
you crazy bitch.

48:06.387 --> 48:09.223
It's embarrassing
not having any money,

48:09.256 --> 48:12.527
but it's more embarrassing
when you do have everything,

48:12.560 --> 48:15.429
like you do,
and you still feel like trash,

48:15.462 --> 48:17.565
and you still feel ashamed,

48:17.599 --> 48:19.400
because you just know,
to a certain degree

48:19.433 --> 48:22.570
that whatever it is that
some men have, that magic,

48:22.604 --> 48:28.342
your whole life has been proof
that you don't have it.

48:34.281 --> 48:36.684
Break in the clouds.

48:36.718 --> 48:39.319
The sun, she's shining again.

48:39.353 --> 48:41.656
White hot. White hot.

48:41.689 --> 48:43.223
- Ah, fuck.

48:43.257 --> 48:44.358
- Blazing hot.

48:44.391 --> 48:47.494
- Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow.

48:47.529 --> 48:48.730
- You see how hot?

48:51.031 --> 48:52.366
The commitment and the focus.

48:52.399 --> 48:54.234
- Where is it?

48:54.268 --> 48:55.235
- So close!

48:55.269 --> 48:56.370
I swear to God!

48:59.541 --> 49:01.609
Uh, uh, uh. Mm-mm. Colder now.

49:01.643 --> 49:02.744
- How can I be colder?

49:02.777 --> 49:05.379
It's a hole in the wall!

49:05.412 --> 49:07.214
- I meant that
you were on the right track

49:07.247 --> 49:08.282
philosophically.

49:08.315 --> 49:09.717
- What the fuck does that mean?

49:09.751 --> 49:11.553
Oh, fuck.

49:11.586 --> 49:13.454
Hal?

49:25.032 --> 49:27.569
- You're fucking with me,
right?

49:27.602 --> 49:29.436
Please just tell me.

49:32.306 --> 49:33.407
- No.

49:37.344 --> 49:39.581
I don't think it's worth
getting killed over.

49:42.483 --> 49:44.151
But no,
I'm not fucking with you.

49:44.184 --> 49:45.753
I'm sorry, baby.

49:49.122 --> 49:51.425
- Why are you doing this to me?

49:53.460 --> 49:54.995
- Hal.

49:56.463 --> 49:57.632
- What?

50:00.502 --> 50:01.736
- You're hard right now.

50:04.171 --> 50:05.138
- No.

50:05.172 --> 50:07.107
No.

50:09.844 --> 50:12.012
- I can see it, Hal.

50:15.550 --> 50:17.752
- Please just stop.

50:17.785 --> 50:21.689
- How can you possibly
be hard right now?

50:21.723 --> 50:25.158
I mean, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

50:35.135 --> 50:36.738
You love this.

50:41.509 --> 50:43.811
- I know that you think

50:43.845 --> 50:46.748
I'm, like,
this harmless little bitch.

50:49.483 --> 50:51.786
But if I wanted to,

50:51.819 --> 50:54.454
I can get rid of you.

50:54.488 --> 50:56.256
It's easy as that.

51:01.228 --> 51:03.831
- Well, you're right there.

51:05.767 --> 51:09.369
I do think
you're a harmless bitch.

52:00.588 --> 52:03.290
You think it's all cute.

52:03.323 --> 52:04.792
You think you're my friend.

52:07.795 --> 52:09.429
You're not my friend.

52:11.498 --> 52:13.801
You're trash.

52:13.835 --> 52:17.471
You mean nothing to me.

52:20.374 --> 52:26.346
And I will make you regret
treating me like this,

52:26.380 --> 52:31.519
because the truth is,
it is easy to get rid of you.

52:34.321 --> 52:36.289
It would cost less
than that watch.

52:42.262 --> 52:43.631
- Okay.

52:46.000 --> 52:47.602
- What does that mean, "Okay"?

52:49.937 --> 52:51.773
- It means I was lying.

52:53.908 --> 52:55.409
There's no video.

53:05.419 --> 53:07.387
Okay.

53:07.421 --> 53:08.823
Good.

53:10.257 --> 53:11.592
That's what I thought.

53:15.663 --> 53:18.833
Now get the fuck out of here.

53:35.783 --> 53:40.855
Just to be clear
about something,

53:40.888 --> 53:43.191
you didn't teach me anything.

53:45.526 --> 53:48.529
I wrote the scenes.

53:48.563 --> 53:50.665
You just said the words.

53:54.035 --> 53:56.571
It could have been anybody.

54:20.528 --> 54:21.929
- You're wrong.

54:24.532 --> 54:25.733
The words don't matter.
They help.

54:25.767 --> 54:27.502
They're like wallpaper
or decoration.

54:27.535 --> 54:29.469
They're nice, but they're not
what's really going on.

54:29.504 --> 54:30.738
- Okay.

54:30.772 --> 54:33.641
So then tell me
what is going on.

54:33.674 --> 54:34.876
- You want to be reprimanded

54:34.909 --> 54:36.711
for what you fear
are inherent flaws

54:36.744 --> 54:39.446
and then rewarded
for coming into compliance.

54:39.479 --> 54:40.915
- If you say so.

55:03.704 --> 55:07.374
I pledge allegiance...

55:08.576 --> 55:11.378
To the flag...

55:11.411 --> 55:12.680
- This is funny.

55:12.713 --> 55:17.350
- Of the United States
of America...

55:20.387 --> 55:24.659
And to the republic

55:24.692 --> 55:29.597
for which it stands,

55:29.630 --> 55:34.101
one nation under God...

55:49.416 --> 55:53.888
Indivisible,

55:53.921 --> 56:00.828
with liberty
and justice for all.

56:05.900 --> 56:08.035
You are good at what you do.

56:10.805 --> 56:13.941
But that doesn't change
the nature of our relationship.

56:16.110 --> 56:20.715
I pay you to make me feel
a certain way.

56:20.748 --> 56:23.450
I--I do it.

56:23.483 --> 56:25.887
And if I stop wanting
to feel that way,

56:25.920 --> 56:30.057
then I stop paying you,
and I don't.

56:30.091 --> 56:31.424
It's up to me.

56:37.665 --> 56:40.433
- Take off your pants.

56:43.070 --> 56:44.471
- No.

56:46.707 --> 56:51.012
- Take off your pants...

56:51.045 --> 56:54.949
so I don't have to keep
punishing you.

56:57.118 --> 57:02.523
- And I am saying no.

57:02.556 --> 57:03.858
- Stop me.

57:03.891 --> 57:05.192
- You're holding a knife
to my neck.

57:05.226 --> 57:06.493
- Okay.

57:06.527 --> 57:07.795
So take it.

57:07.828 --> 57:09.864
Take this knife.

57:09.897 --> 57:11.532
You're stronger than I am.
Take it.

57:11.565 --> 57:13.167
Tie me up. Come on, please.

57:13.200 --> 57:14.735
- I should.

57:17.171 --> 57:18.706
- How about this?

57:21.042 --> 57:23.010
Just say to me that
you don't care what I want

57:23.044 --> 57:25.680
and that it's not the most
important thing to you.

57:28.182 --> 57:29.784
Say that, and I'll stop.

57:43.965 --> 57:46.267
Pull down your pants.

58:05.786 --> 58:08.289
It's the only
good thing about you.

58:16.630 --> 58:20.735
I'm going to use this...

58:20.768 --> 58:23.204
because it belongs to me.

58:26.107 --> 58:28.242
- And you...

58:28.275 --> 58:33.214
are going to be quiet
and cooperate.

58:41.655 --> 58:43.090
- You know,
you say all this shit to me,

58:43.124 --> 58:46.727
what kind of a person I am,

58:46.761 --> 58:48.863
but you're a bad person too.

58:50.364 --> 58:53.200
You're fucking evil.

58:58.272 --> 59:01.909
- When I tell you.

59:01.942 --> 59:04.311
Not before.

59:06.847 --> 59:09.750
You're gonna come inside me.

59:12.019 --> 59:15.256
But I want to tell you
something first.

59:17.691 --> 59:21.095
I have an app on my phone,

59:21.128 --> 59:23.764
and it tells me
when I'm ovulating.

59:27.334 --> 59:29.637
I'm ovulating right now.

59:32.940 --> 59:37.011
And when I tell you to come,

59:37.044 --> 59:40.314
you're gonna come inside me.

59:40.347 --> 59:44.985
You're gonna do it,

59:45.019 --> 59:47.321
and you're gonna
make me pregnant.

59:50.057 --> 59:52.293
And I'm gonna have the baby.

59:54.295 --> 59:57.698
A boy.

59:57.731 --> 01:00:00.267
And every single night,

01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:04.171
you're gonna put him into bed,

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:07.708
and he's gonna look up at you,

01:00:07.741 --> 01:00:09.743
and he's gonna smile.

01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:14.215
You're gonna thank me
for the life I've given you.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:18.652
Say that's what you want.

01:00:21.889 --> 01:00:23.824
Do it and I'll let you come.

01:00:27.161 --> 01:00:29.830
- I understand.
That's what I want.

01:00:31.866 --> 01:00:33.334
- Okay, you can come now.

01:01:10.505 --> 01:01:12.106
- I'll pay it.

01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.745
Half--

01:01:17.778 --> 01:01:19.780
half my salary
for the first year,

01:01:19.813 --> 01:01:22.049
and half my bonus.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.885
$6 million.

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.164
- What are you doing?

01:02:44.198 --> 01:02:45.199
- I'm getting it set up.

01:02:45.232 --> 01:02:46.501
The lawyer has to do it.

01:02:50.538 --> 01:02:52.540
- "Hey, Gary. Weird ask.

01:02:52.574 --> 01:02:54.842
"Can you please deposit
$6 million

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:55.543
into the following account?"

01:02:55.577 --> 01:02:57.545
Are you joking?

01:02:57.579 --> 01:02:58.979
- What?

01:02:59.013 --> 01:03:00.114
- You can't just wire it to me,
Hal.

01:03:00.147 --> 01:03:01.849
The IRS is gonna be living
at my house.

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.551
- No. Gary will figure it out.
He's really good.

01:03:03.585 --> 01:03:06.220
- Here's what
you're gonna tell Gary.

01:03:06.253 --> 01:03:08.022
He's gonna set up two
corporations in the Caymans,

01:03:08.055 --> 01:03:09.156
one for you guys, one for me.

01:03:09.189 --> 01:03:10.224
You should be typing.

01:03:10.257 --> 01:03:12.092
- Okay.

01:03:12.126 --> 01:03:13.927
- He'll transfer the money
there quarterly

01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.396
in divisions under $1 million.

01:03:16.864 --> 01:03:18.165
Got it?

01:03:18.198 --> 01:03:20.067
- The Caymans.
That's a tax shelter, right?

01:03:25.372 --> 01:03:27.408
- Yeah.

01:03:27.441 --> 01:03:29.410
Send that.

01:03:29.443 --> 01:03:31.546
I know where to find you
if this Gary...

01:03:31.579 --> 01:03:33.047
- Yes.
- Doesn't exist.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:34.214
- You do.

01:03:36.283 --> 01:03:39.621
- And what--
what you said before,

01:03:39.654 --> 01:03:42.456
is that what you want?

01:03:42.489 --> 01:03:45.459
To have a kid?

01:03:45.492 --> 01:03:49.163
- Um, no.

01:03:49.196 --> 01:03:51.398
I said that
because you were wrong

01:03:51.432 --> 01:03:54.034
and I don't like
losing arguments.

01:03:54.068 --> 01:03:55.402
- Oh.

01:03:57.304 --> 01:03:59.239
- And I have endometriosis.

01:03:59.273 --> 01:04:02.843
So it's very unlikely
I'll be able to have children.

01:04:04.945 --> 01:04:06.080
- Oh.

01:04:09.316 --> 01:04:11.151
- Have a good
rest of your weekend.

01:04:11.185 --> 01:04:12.587
- Okay, you do the same.

01:04:32.439 --> 01:04:34.341
- Hi.
I can't really talk right now.

01:04:38.479 --> 01:04:39.480
Alexander.

01:04:39.514 --> 01:04:41.348
Alexander, I can't hear you.

01:04:43.050 --> 01:04:44.318
Because you're crying.

01:04:46.521 --> 01:04:48.956
No.

01:04:48.989 --> 01:04:50.457
No, there's nothing
that you can do.

01:04:52.025 --> 01:04:55.429
You can call again
if that helps,

01:04:55.462 --> 01:04:58.265
but this is the last time
that I'm gonna pick up, okay?

01:04:58.298 --> 01:04:59.266
Goodbye.

01:05:17.017 --> 01:05:18.520
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:21.088
- Um, I was--

01:05:21.121 --> 01:05:23.558
I was thinking about
something that you said.

01:05:23.591 --> 01:05:25.259
- I promise you, Hal,
I cannot get pregnant.

01:05:25.292 --> 01:05:27.194
- No, not that.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:30.364
You said that
you know where to find me.

01:05:30.397 --> 01:05:32.266
- I do.

01:05:32.299 --> 01:05:33.735
But you sent the email, right?

01:05:33.768 --> 01:05:35.002
- Well, yeah.

01:05:35.035 --> 01:05:36.604
But then it occurred to me,

01:05:36.638 --> 01:05:41.375
what's to stop you
from just doing this again?

01:05:41.408 --> 01:05:43.310
Like, what's to stop you

01:05:43.343 --> 01:05:46.213
from coming back next month,
like--

01:05:48.616 --> 01:05:51.251
- I guess you'll have to take
my word for it.

01:05:51.285 --> 01:05:53.387
- Well, I was thinking that--

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:56.758
that I need, um,
something from you,

01:05:56.791 --> 01:06:02.630
something equivalent
that can prevent you--

01:06:02.664 --> 01:06:04.298
- Collateral.
- Yes, collateral.

01:06:04.331 --> 01:06:05.332
Exactly.

01:06:05.365 --> 01:06:09.069
Um, collateral.

01:06:09.102 --> 01:06:10.337
Yes, something solid.

01:06:10.370 --> 01:06:12.507
Something important to you.

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:13.641
- I get what you mean, Hal.
- Okay.

01:06:13.675 --> 01:06:15.409
- But you already sent
the email, right?

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:17.010
- I'll--so?
I'll send another one.

01:06:17.044 --> 01:06:18.646
I'll say, "Please disregard."
He doesn't care.

01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:20.314
- What happened to all your
smug money confidence?

01:06:20.347 --> 01:06:21.616
Didn't seem like
this even mattered to you.

01:06:21.649 --> 01:06:23.484
- It didn't,
and then it occurred to me

01:06:23.518 --> 01:06:25.787
that you can do this again
and again and again for years,

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:27.054
and then I have to see--

01:06:27.087 --> 01:06:30.023
um, go over this
again and again,

01:06:30.057 --> 01:06:32.125
and I'm not prepared
to do that.

01:06:35.128 --> 01:06:37.264
- To see me again?

01:06:37.297 --> 01:06:38.298
- Hey.

01:06:38.332 --> 01:06:39.299
No, it's not personal.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:40.467
I mean, it's like a--

01:06:40.502 --> 01:06:42.269
financially,
it's a little insane.

01:06:42.302 --> 01:06:44.137
- Okay, so here's the new deal.
Fuck your collateral.

01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:45.405
- What?
- Fuck your collateral.

01:06:45.439 --> 01:06:47.207
- Hold on.
- And no.

01:06:47.241 --> 01:06:49.176
I give you no assurance that
I won't be doing this again.

01:06:49.209 --> 01:06:51.646
- Rebecca.
- In fact, if I were you--

01:06:51.679 --> 01:06:53.080
- We need to talk seriously.

01:06:53.113 --> 01:06:54.081
- Oh, I'm being serious.

01:06:54.114 --> 01:06:55.115
- Okay? Please?

01:06:55.148 --> 01:06:56.316
- I give you no assurance.

01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:57.519
And if I were you,
I would start thinking

01:06:57.552 --> 01:06:59.086
about ways to keep me happy,

01:06:59.119 --> 01:07:00.655
like, in perpetuity

01:07:00.688 --> 01:07:02.356
if dealing with me
is so disgusting too you.

01:07:02.389 --> 01:07:05.292
- No--what does that mean,
perpetuity?

01:07:05.325 --> 01:07:06.360
- It means forever, Hal.

01:07:06.393 --> 01:07:07.394
- Yeah, I know.

01:07:07.427 --> 01:07:08.663
I mean, what do you mean?

01:07:08.696 --> 01:07:11.365
- Oh, okay.
See, I'm not the writer.

01:07:11.398 --> 01:07:12.667
So you might have to do
some thinking on your own.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:14.368
But off the top of my head,

01:07:14.401 --> 01:07:18.506
it's something like a position.

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.307
- A posi--a position?

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.509
- A position, yeah.
- What?

01:07:21.543 --> 01:07:22.844
- At the company.
Good salary.

01:07:22.877 --> 01:07:23.811
- No.
- Good benefits.

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:25.178
Reasonably sized staff.
- What?

01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:26.380
- Office near yours.
- No.

01:07:26.413 --> 01:07:28.482
We--we are not talking
about that.

01:07:28.516 --> 01:07:30.117
- Well, that's
what I'm talking about,

01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:31.218
and that is the only thing
that matters.

01:07:31.251 --> 01:07:32.554
- Hey. Hold on.

01:07:32.587 --> 01:07:33.688
- You can think it over
and come back to me.

01:07:33.721 --> 01:07:34.622
It can be a discussion.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:34.656 --> 01:07:36.156
Whoa. No.

01:07:36.189 --> 01:07:37.391
Stop. Time out.

01:07:37.424 --> 01:07:38.793
Go back. Okay?

01:07:38.826 --> 01:07:39.861
Let's go back.

01:07:39.894 --> 01:07:40.795
We're gonna go back now.

01:07:40.828 --> 01:07:43.731
Six--I'll give you
the $6 million, okay?

01:07:43.765 --> 01:07:45.667
If, and only if,
you tell me one

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.367
damaging piece of information
about yourself.

01:07:47.401 --> 01:07:48.402
- That whole thing has bloomed
and died, my friend.

01:07:48.435 --> 01:07:49.571
- No, it hasn't!

01:07:49.604 --> 01:07:51.104
- We are in
a whole new world now.

01:07:51.138 --> 01:07:52.507
We are talking about
where, in relation to yours,

01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.841
my office is going to be.
- No.

01:07:53.875 --> 01:07:55.375
- And we need to start talking
about my title.

01:07:55.409 --> 01:07:56.511
- What? No!

01:07:56.544 --> 01:07:57.679
We are not talking about that.

01:07:57.712 --> 01:07:59.179
Are you insane?

01:07:59.212 --> 01:08:00.715
- Would it be weird
if we were co-CEOs?

01:08:00.748 --> 01:08:02.449
- Yes.
- Has anybody done that?

01:08:02.482 --> 01:08:03.885
- No. No.

01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:05.653
We are not doing that.

01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:07.722
- Well, maybe we're not doing
exactly that,

01:08:07.755 --> 01:08:09.557
but we are doing
something like that.

01:08:09.591 --> 01:08:10.558
- No. No.
- Yes.

01:08:10.592 --> 01:08:11.726
- No.
- Yes.

01:08:11.759 --> 01:08:12.794
That's the result of you
coming out here

01:08:12.827 --> 01:08:13.828
and opening
your wormy little mouth

01:08:13.861 --> 01:08:14.662
trying to extract...
- Shut up.

01:08:14.696 --> 01:08:15.530
- Some concession when...
- Shut--

01:08:15.563 --> 01:08:16.898
- You have zero leverage!
- Shut up.

01:08:16.931 --> 01:08:17.899
Come here.
- Ow!

01:08:17.932 --> 01:08:19.299
Stop it, you fucking clod!

01:08:19.333 --> 01:08:20.400
- I just want to talk.

01:08:20.434 --> 01:08:21.569
- Rape!

01:08:21.603 --> 01:08:23.170
- Just go back in the room.
- Rape!

01:08:23.203 --> 01:08:24.304
Somebody help me!
I'm being raped!

01:08:24.338 --> 01:08:25.873
Oh, my God.

01:08:25.907 --> 01:08:28.275
Ow! Rape!

01:08:28.308 --> 01:08:30.377
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:08:30.410 --> 01:08:31.445
- Do you think
anybody called the cops?

01:08:31.478 --> 01:08:32.379
I was really screaming
out there.

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:33.380
- Look, all I want to do

01:08:33.413 --> 01:08:34.549
is just figure out a way

01:08:34.582 --> 01:08:35.717
that we can end this
so that we both

01:08:35.750 --> 01:08:36.751
can be sure that it is over.
- Okay.

01:08:36.784 --> 01:08:37.919
- That is all I want.
- Okay.

01:08:37.952 --> 01:08:39.219
Okay. Okay.

01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:40.287
I told you, I need security.

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:41.455
I need a position
at the company.

01:08:41.488 --> 01:08:42.757
- Are you insane?

01:08:42.790 --> 01:08:44.424
Are you insane?

01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:45.459
Oh, my God!

01:08:45.492 --> 01:08:46.894
I don't know what you're doing!

01:08:48.896 --> 01:08:51.666
- I'm fighting, Hal.

01:08:51.699 --> 01:08:54.636
It's how you win something,
in case you were wondering.

01:08:58.606 --> 01:08:59.741
So what?

01:09:01.542 --> 01:09:02.810
You're not gonna give me a job?

01:09:02.844 --> 01:09:03.811
- No.

01:09:03.845 --> 01:09:05.379
Yes, correct.

01:09:08.983 --> 01:09:10.818
Rebecca.
- Mm-hmm.

01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:12.520
Rebecca.

01:09:12.553 --> 01:09:16.691
- Hey, @porterfieldhotels,

01:09:16.724 --> 01:09:18.526
is this your new CEO?

01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:20.561
- What are you doing?

01:09:20.595 --> 01:09:22.697
- Tweeting the video.

01:09:22.730 --> 01:09:23.497
- Oh, my God.

01:09:23.531 --> 01:09:25.533
There is no video!

01:09:25.566 --> 01:09:26.567
There is no camera!

01:09:26.601 --> 01:09:28.670
You told me that!

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.203
- I lied.

01:09:39.379 --> 01:09:40.948
- Why did you do this?

01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:46.854
- You wouldn't believe me.

01:09:46.888 --> 01:09:51.358
- I trusted you
with everything about me.

01:10:32.567 --> 01:10:34.301
Get up already.

01:10:40.041 --> 01:10:41.542
I knew you were like this,

01:10:41.576 --> 01:10:44.311
you fucking limp
pent-up serial killer!

01:10:44.344 --> 01:10:45.345
- Fuck.

01:10:45.378 --> 01:10:46.647
What's the code?

01:10:46.681 --> 01:10:49.382
- Fuck you, Ted Bundy.

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.685
- Rebecca, what is the code?

01:10:50.718 --> 01:10:52.720
- Bill Clinton piece of shit.

01:10:52.754 --> 01:10:54.021
- Look at it, Rebecca.

01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:56.490
Rebecca, look at it.

01:10:57.859 --> 01:10:59.392
Fuck!

01:11:03.363 --> 01:11:05.967
You are putting me in
an impossible situation.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.401
You are making it impossible
for me and you

01:11:08.435 --> 01:11:12.073
to walk out of here,
which is what I want.

01:11:12.106 --> 01:11:14.776
- What are you trying to say?
- I don't know.

01:11:14.809 --> 01:11:16.911
The people I work with,
my family, my mother,

01:11:16.944 --> 01:11:19.312
they--they just cannot see
that video.

01:11:19.346 --> 01:11:20.882
Okay?

01:11:20.915 --> 01:11:22.784
- Why are you so scared
of them?

01:11:22.817 --> 01:11:24.752
- Because they don't know me!

01:11:24.786 --> 01:11:26.453
This is supposed to be mine,

01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:29.590
the only thing that is actually
mine, God damn it!

01:11:29.624 --> 01:11:30.992
I offered you money,

01:11:31.025 --> 01:11:33.326
more than you can make
in two lifetimes.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.996
I got you a gift.

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:38.065
What do you want?
What do you want?

01:11:38.099 --> 01:11:40.968
Do you want to be CEO
of a hotel company?

01:11:43.805 --> 01:11:44.806
- No.

01:11:47.008 --> 01:11:49.610
- Okay, please--please,

01:11:49.644 --> 01:11:52.613
then God, just tell me.

01:11:52.647 --> 01:11:53.446
Do you want me to beg?

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.448
I will beg you.

01:11:55.482 --> 01:12:00.721
Please, do not ruin
my intolerable, pointless life.

01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:04.491
Just take your money
and just leave me to it.

01:12:04.525 --> 01:12:06.393
Okay?

01:12:06.426 --> 01:12:07.662
I don't--do you even know
why you're doing this,

01:12:07.695 --> 01:12:09.130
or is this just the game?

01:12:09.163 --> 01:12:10.531
- Yes.

01:12:10.565 --> 01:12:11.464
- Which one?

01:12:11.498 --> 01:12:13.634
Which is it?

01:12:13.668 --> 01:12:15.736
- I know what I want.

01:12:18.405 --> 01:12:20.675
I want to play this game.

01:12:21.408 --> 01:12:23.476
- I don't--I don't understand.

01:12:26.479 --> 01:12:28.481
- I quit my job.

01:12:30.051 --> 01:12:32.720
- What job?

01:12:32.753 --> 01:12:34.989
- I quit this job, dominating.

01:12:36.557 --> 01:12:37.825
I fired my broker.

01:12:37.859 --> 01:12:38.926
I haven't seen a client
in months.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.995
I'm living off of my savings.

01:12:41.028 --> 01:12:43.496
- Why?

01:12:43.531 --> 01:12:45.398
- It felt disloyal.

01:12:47.602 --> 01:12:48.836
- Disloyal to who?

01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:51.639
To me?

01:12:51.672 --> 01:12:52.940
- I had a fiancé, Alexander.

01:12:52.974 --> 01:12:54.542
I ended it.
I broke up with him.

01:12:54.575 --> 01:12:55.676
He's fucking furious.

01:12:55.710 --> 01:12:57.044
He has no idea.

01:12:57.078 --> 01:12:59.647
- Because you felt
disloyal to me?

01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:04.919
- Yes.

01:13:04.952 --> 01:13:06.453
To us.

01:13:06.486 --> 01:13:08.923
To--to what we do here.

01:13:08.956 --> 01:13:10.925
I'm sorry, okay?
I know. I get it.

01:13:10.958 --> 01:13:12.593
You want me to be in charge.
- Stop.

01:13:12.627 --> 01:13:13.995
- I know this is painful
for you.

01:13:16.097 --> 01:13:19.466
Hal, after our first session...
- Please.

01:13:19.499 --> 01:13:20.935
- Do you remember you had me...
- Stop.

01:13:20.968 --> 01:13:22.637
- Do the thing with
the fucking cuticle clippers?

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:24.437
I went home
and I couldn't sleep.

01:13:24.471 --> 01:13:26.207
I couldn't sleep all night.

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:28.209
I was shining.

01:13:28.242 --> 01:13:29.710
And then you called me again

01:13:29.744 --> 01:13:30.778
and I got
that very same feeling,

01:13:30.811 --> 01:13:31.746
like when you win something,

01:13:31.779 --> 01:13:33.080
like you just know

01:13:33.114 --> 01:13:35.082
that you're gonna get
what you want.

01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.784
I thought it would go away.
I did.

01:13:36.817 --> 01:13:37.752
I thought it would go away.

01:13:37.785 --> 01:13:38.753
But it didn't.

01:13:38.786 --> 01:13:40.955
It got worse and worse.

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:42.455
Why do you think that I started
taping the sessions?

01:13:42.489 --> 01:13:43.891
It was for me.

01:13:43.925 --> 01:13:45.593
- Stop.
- So that I could have them.

01:13:47.662 --> 01:13:50.731
We're suited
to each other, Hal.

01:13:50.765 --> 01:13:56.137
What we do here, what happens,

01:13:56.170 --> 01:13:59.073
it's magic.

01:13:59.106 --> 01:14:00.241
- No.

01:14:00.274 --> 01:14:02.475
No. No.

01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:03.844
No.

01:14:03.878 --> 01:14:05.513
You are not gonna do this.

01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:07.014
I'm so tired.

01:14:07.048 --> 01:14:09.650
You're not gonna mind fuck me
like this.

01:14:09.684 --> 01:14:10.952
- Why are you pretending like

01:14:10.985 --> 01:14:13.187
you don't know
what I'm talking about?

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:15.488
All those people out there
in the world

01:14:15.523 --> 01:14:20.161
and the shit that they do,
what is that compared to this?

01:14:20.194 --> 01:14:23.130
I hate myself
when I'm out there.

01:14:23.164 --> 01:14:26.767
I hate the way I look
and the sound of my voice.

01:14:26.801 --> 01:14:28.803
I hate myself out there.

01:14:28.836 --> 01:14:33.708
But in here, when I'm with you,

01:14:33.741 --> 01:14:37.144
I am exactly who I want to be.

01:14:39.714 --> 01:14:42.550
When I'm in control of you, I--

01:14:42.583 --> 01:14:45.553
I am the person that I dreamed
I would be when I was young.

01:14:45.586 --> 01:14:46.954
I am--I'm--

01:14:46.988 --> 01:14:51.993
I'm funny, and I'm mean,
and I am strong.

01:14:52.026 --> 01:14:58.833
And I never, never feel
like that out there.

01:14:58.866 --> 01:15:01.569
And it's the same for you.

01:15:01.602 --> 01:15:02.570
- No.

01:15:02.603 --> 01:15:03.838
It's not.

01:15:03.871 --> 01:15:05.072
I hate that I do this.

01:15:05.106 --> 01:15:07.074
I hate myself. It's shameful.

01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:10.878
- I unlocked something in you.

01:15:12.947 --> 01:15:14.749
- How do you know that?

01:15:14.782 --> 01:15:16.617
- I know.

01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.285
I know that you think
that you need to be

01:15:18.319 --> 01:15:21.856
this person like your dad,
who's strong,

01:15:21.889 --> 01:15:23.758
who looks forward
to the future.

01:15:23.791 --> 01:15:25.726
But that's not you.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.162
You are abnormal.

01:15:28.195 --> 01:15:29.864
And I don't just mean sexually.

01:15:29.897 --> 01:15:31.198
I mean fundamentally in a way

01:15:31.232 --> 01:15:32.733
that most people would just
find unacceptable.

01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:33.901
- Sanctuary.

01:15:33.934 --> 01:15:36.737
- But for me, in here, we fit.

01:15:36.771 --> 01:15:37.905
- Sanctuary.

01:15:37.938 --> 01:15:40.574
- For me, in here,
we fit perfectly.

01:15:40.608 --> 01:15:41.609
- Did you hear me?

01:15:41.642 --> 01:15:42.676
Sanctuary.

01:15:42.710 --> 01:15:44.945
Sanctuary. Sanctuary!

01:15:44.979 --> 01:15:46.113
Sanctuary.
- Sanctuary what?

01:15:46.147 --> 01:15:46.947
- Sanctuary!

01:15:46.981 --> 01:15:48.349
I'm using the safe word.

01:15:48.382 --> 01:15:49.316
Sanctuary!

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.652
Sanctuary! Stop!

01:15:53.788 --> 01:15:56.791
- I'm not playing.

01:15:56.824 --> 01:15:58.192
- Oh, my God.

01:15:58.225 --> 01:16:01.028
Will you just give me
a fucking break?

01:16:01.062 --> 01:16:04.065
Please,
give me a fucking break.

01:16:04.098 --> 01:16:08.035
From the moment you walked back
in here, you want $6 million.

01:16:08.069 --> 01:16:10.671
You want to be co-CEO
of a hotel company.

01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:12.606
You are doing a session.

01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:15.376
- I quit my job.

01:16:15.409 --> 01:16:17.878
I left my fiancé.

01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:20.915
It's true.

01:16:22.316 --> 01:16:23.884
- This isn't real.

01:16:25.386 --> 01:16:27.822
That's not real.

01:16:31.158 --> 01:16:34.929
- This is the only thing
that is real.

01:16:53.714 --> 01:16:55.049
Hal.

01:17:16.937 --> 01:17:17.938
What is this, Hal?

01:17:17.972 --> 01:17:21.175
- You're gonna stop talking.

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:24.311
If you talk again,
I'm gonna hurt you.

01:17:24.345 --> 01:17:26.313
I will.

01:17:33.888 --> 01:17:37.091
You didn't quit your job.

01:17:37.124 --> 01:17:40.895
You didn't break up
with your boyfriend.

01:17:40.928 --> 01:17:44.732
The only good thing about me
to you is the money.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:49.236
That's the truth.

01:17:49.270 --> 01:17:50.738
Now say it.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.475
- You want me to speak?

01:17:56.944 --> 01:17:59.380
- I want you to say that.

01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:07.955
Say it or I will kill you,

01:18:07.988 --> 01:18:09.823
and then I'll kill myself.

01:18:13.127 --> 01:18:15.429
Just tell the truth.

01:18:15.462 --> 01:18:17.464
I am nothing.

01:18:17.498 --> 01:18:21.335
Just say that.

01:18:24.171 --> 01:18:26.340
- I have a better idea.

01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:31.478
We need to play a game.

01:18:31.513 --> 01:18:33.914
It's the last one.
You're gonna--

01:18:33.948 --> 01:18:37.351
- Say what I fucking
told you to say!

01:18:41.889 --> 01:18:43.757
We need to play a game.

01:18:48.429 --> 01:18:50.264
You be you.

01:18:54.802 --> 01:18:57.805
I'll be your dad.

01:19:07.549 --> 01:19:09.183
Greet me.

01:19:12.386 --> 01:19:15.022
I'm your father.

01:19:15.055 --> 01:19:17.224
I said, "Greet me."

01:19:22.896 --> 01:19:24.566
I came back from the fucking
dead to speak to you,

01:19:24.599 --> 01:19:27.101
so the least that you could do
is say hello.

01:19:31.606 --> 01:19:34.174
- Hello.

01:19:39.547 --> 01:19:42.216
- I'm sorry I left you.

01:19:42.249 --> 01:19:45.085
- He wouldn't say that.

01:19:48.088 --> 01:19:50.891
- It was beyond my control.

01:19:57.264 --> 01:19:59.333
Untie Rebecca.

01:20:04.539 --> 01:20:06.307
- No.

01:20:06.340 --> 01:20:09.410
No.

01:20:09.443 --> 01:20:11.178
- Why not?

01:20:17.585 --> 01:20:20.387
- Because you don't have
the power anymore.

01:20:20.421 --> 01:20:22.956
I do.

01:20:22.990 --> 01:20:25.059
And you are gonna take back
what you said

01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:27.895
about your job
and your boyfriend,

01:20:27.928 --> 01:20:31.198
and you are gonna delete
that fucking video.

01:20:34.101 --> 01:20:37.572
- Boy, do not test me!

01:20:45.946 --> 01:20:49.517
Look at this mess you made,
you little shit!

01:20:51.218 --> 01:20:52.920
- This is my fucking place!

01:20:52.953 --> 01:20:54.088
- I'm sorry.

01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:55.122
- Shut up!

01:21:11.205 --> 01:21:12.574
- Where are you?

01:21:17.111 --> 01:21:20.548
Okay, I get it.

01:21:23.317 --> 01:21:25.620
Good job.

01:21:25.653 --> 01:21:27.321
Good game.

01:21:47.441 --> 01:21:52.146
I lived 78 years here on Earth.

01:21:52.179 --> 01:21:55.249
Made money.

01:21:55.282 --> 01:21:57.985
Raised a family.

01:22:02.189 --> 01:22:05.359
I was a lucky man.

01:22:05.392 --> 01:22:08.228
I was happy.

01:22:08.262 --> 01:22:12.499
Thousands of people
worked for me.

01:22:12.534 --> 01:22:15.235
The company I built,

01:22:15.269 --> 01:22:17.705
homes they bought,

01:22:17.739 --> 01:22:19.239
food they ate,

01:22:19.273 --> 01:22:21.241
the clothes they put
on their children's back.

01:22:24.411 --> 01:22:26.180
It was me.

01:22:27.414 --> 01:22:32.219
When I died, they wept.

01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:35.022
I saw them crying.

01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:39.159
I was outside of my body
by then.

01:22:43.464 --> 01:22:46.701
And I could see everything,

01:22:46.734 --> 01:22:50.572
everything that happened,

01:22:50.605 --> 01:22:52.540
everything that's
still to come.

01:23:01.114 --> 01:23:04.451
I saw you crying.

01:23:04.485 --> 01:23:07.722
How scared you were.

01:23:07.755 --> 01:23:12.794
How desperately you wanted
to know that you could do it.

01:23:16.163 --> 01:23:17.732
Be me.

01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:22.604
You can't.

01:23:40.354 --> 01:23:42.155
You are you.

01:23:49.196 --> 01:23:50.632
You hate yourself.

01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:55.803
I understand why you do.

01:23:57.371 --> 01:23:59.607
But that's not gonna change
anything.

01:24:01.676 --> 01:24:05.747
You're nothing like me,
and you never will be.

01:24:11.184 --> 01:24:12.554
Say it.

01:24:16.591 --> 01:24:19.059
- I'm nothing like you.

01:24:22.764 --> 01:24:24.264
- And?

01:24:30.538 --> 01:24:32.507
- And...

01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:34.876
and I don't have to be.

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:50.011
- Hi.

01:26:50.044 --> 01:26:51.411
- Hey.

01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.685
- I deleted the video.

01:26:58.986 --> 01:27:00.420
- Oh.

01:27:00.454 --> 01:27:01.789
Thank you.

01:27:07.695 --> 01:27:08.930
- I should get going.

01:27:08.963 --> 01:27:10.565
- Yeah, I should too.

01:27:17.572 --> 01:27:20.908
Oh, um, do you, uh--

01:27:20.942 --> 01:27:22.476
do you want this?

01:27:25.445 --> 01:27:26.614
- It's not broken?

01:27:26.647 --> 01:27:28.415
- No. It's waterproof.

01:27:38.059 --> 01:27:39.060
- Thanks.

01:27:39.093 --> 01:27:40.460
- Mm-hmm.

01:28:11.659 --> 01:28:13.493
I'm running late.

01:28:16.496 --> 01:28:18.699
I have to--

01:28:18.733 --> 01:28:21.035
my mom, she wants to discuss...

01:28:22.904 --> 01:28:26.007
Uh, she's giving a speech
at this dinner

01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:31.012
to, you know, debut me,
and uh...

01:28:33.681 --> 01:28:36.349
It's--it's funny.

01:28:36.383 --> 01:28:40.054
The thought of, you know, like,
what if I just didn't show up?

01:28:43.157 --> 01:28:44.759
Like, she's just talking
and talking, I don't come out.

01:28:44.792 --> 01:28:47.862
Might be funny.

01:28:50.531 --> 01:28:51.632
After you.

01:29:05.146 --> 01:29:06.047
What if I didn't do it?

01:29:08.950 --> 01:29:10.585
- The job?

01:29:10.618 --> 01:29:12.419
- Yeah.

01:29:12.452 --> 01:29:15.590
- Somebody else would,
and everything your dad built

01:29:15.623 --> 01:29:17.457
would belong to them.

01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:19.727
- Right.

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:20.795
- If you hate these people
so much,

01:29:20.828 --> 01:29:21.729
why don't you just
get rid of them?

01:29:21.762 --> 01:29:23.798
- It's not that simple.

01:29:23.831 --> 01:29:25.933
- Don't tell me what I do
and do not know, Hal.

01:29:25.967 --> 01:29:27.735
You can absolutely
get rid of them.

01:29:27.768 --> 01:29:29.737
It's called management buyout.

01:29:29.770 --> 01:29:31.572
- Right. Yeah.

01:29:31.606 --> 01:29:33.440
So what--what--

01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:34.909
- Okay, you inherited money
from your father,

01:29:34.942 --> 01:29:36.978
some obscene amount, right?
- Yes.

01:29:37.011 --> 01:29:38.411
- So you take
all of that money.

01:29:38.445 --> 01:29:40.948
The market cap is 185.
Can you cover that?

01:29:40.982 --> 01:29:43.951
- Um, that would be--
that's, like, everything.

01:29:43.985 --> 01:29:46.020
- So you take
all of that money,

01:29:46.053 --> 01:29:47.788
and then you would buy back
the company.

01:29:47.822 --> 01:29:49.123
Then it's yours.
You can do whatever you want.

01:29:49.156 --> 01:29:50.725
You can fire the board.
It doesn't matter.

01:29:50.758 --> 01:29:51.792
- Managed buyout?

01:29:51.826 --> 01:29:54.195
- Management.
- Management.

01:29:54.228 --> 01:29:55.596
Right.

01:30:06.807 --> 01:30:08.209
Is that what you would do?

01:30:09.977 --> 01:30:11.879
- If I were you?

01:30:11.913 --> 01:30:14.081
- Yeah.

01:30:14.115 --> 01:30:16.050
- Yeah, maybe.

01:30:18.786 --> 01:30:21.122
- What if you were me?

01:30:21.155 --> 01:30:22.189
- What does that mean?

01:30:24.025 --> 01:30:26.727
- What if you took the job,
not me?

01:30:28.529 --> 01:30:29.830
- That doesn't--

01:30:29.864 --> 01:30:32.600
- You just said,
if I do the manager buyback--

01:30:32.633 --> 01:30:34.635
whatever--I can do what I want.

01:30:34.669 --> 01:30:35.736
So I do that,

01:30:35.770 --> 01:30:38.773
and I make you CEO.

01:30:38.806 --> 01:30:39.974
- You're scared
about saying goodbye,

01:30:40.007 --> 01:30:41.142
but you don't have to be.
- No. Shut up.

01:30:41.175 --> 01:30:43.476
This could actually work.

01:30:43.511 --> 01:30:44.946
- Just because I know
more about this than you do

01:30:44.979 --> 01:30:45.579
doesn't mean that I would be
any good at this, Hal.

01:30:45.613 --> 01:30:46.914
It doesn't mean anything.

01:30:46.948 --> 01:30:47.882
- I grew up
around these people.

01:30:47.915 --> 01:30:49.583
I was raised by one of them.

01:30:49.617 --> 01:30:50.985
They all dream all day.

01:30:51.018 --> 01:30:52.253
They read books,
they hire coaches,

01:30:52.286 --> 01:30:54.655
all to be exactly like you.

01:30:54.689 --> 01:30:56.557
Fucking crazy and vindictive.

01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:57.825
- I'm only like that at work.

01:30:57.858 --> 01:30:59.260
- Yeah, this would be
your work.

01:30:59.293 --> 01:31:00.895
- Don't tell me what I want.

01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:01.996
This is your problem, not mine.

01:31:02.029 --> 01:31:06.801
- You said that
you love who you are

01:31:06.834 --> 01:31:09.036
when you're playing the game.

01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:13.541
You can be that person
all day, every day.

01:31:17.545 --> 01:31:21.182
- So I would just go in there
and say what I want to do?

01:31:21.215 --> 01:31:23.050
- And you just bend everyone
around to your will,

01:31:23.084 --> 01:31:24.685
and it doesn't matter
if you're right or wrong.

01:31:24.719 --> 01:31:26.821
It just matters that
people listen to what you say.

01:31:28.923 --> 01:31:31.125
- You want to spend
$185 million on this?

01:31:31.158 --> 01:31:32.693
- Yes.

01:31:32.727 --> 01:31:34.929
- All of your money?
- Yes.

01:31:34.962 --> 01:31:36.163
- What are you gonna do?

01:31:36.197 --> 01:31:36.831
- What do you mean?

01:31:36.864 --> 01:31:37.965
- All day while I'm at work,

01:31:37.999 --> 01:31:39.166
what are you gonna do?

01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:39.834
- Nothing.

01:31:39.867 --> 01:31:43.204
I'll be like, uh, your wife.

01:31:43.237 --> 01:31:45.172
- Having no job, having
nothing important to do all day

01:31:45.206 --> 01:31:46.574
but wait for somebody
to come home?

01:31:46.607 --> 01:31:47.675
That destroys people.

01:31:47.708 --> 01:31:49.043
- You're right. I don't know.

01:31:49.076 --> 01:31:50.678
But listen, I know
what it takes to do this job.

01:31:50.711 --> 01:31:52.580
It's hard, okay?

01:31:52.613 --> 01:31:53.748
It takes everything.

01:31:53.781 --> 01:31:55.716
So you're gonna need
comfort, support,

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:58.886
stability, food, sex, laundry.

01:31:58.919 --> 01:32:01.722
What do you call the person
that does all those things?

01:32:01.756 --> 01:32:03.124
- A slave.

01:32:03.157 --> 01:32:06.227
- That is the job
that I was meant for.

01:32:10.898 --> 01:32:12.666
- What are you gonna tell
your mom?

01:32:12.700 --> 01:32:13.734
See?

01:32:13.768 --> 01:32:15.736
Not gonna work.

01:32:15.770 --> 01:32:17.872
You can't even,
in an imaginary conversation,

01:32:17.905 --> 01:32:18.539
think about
what you'd say to her

01:32:18.572 --> 01:32:19.607
without almost throwing up.

01:32:19.640 --> 01:32:21.575
- Wait.

01:32:21.609 --> 01:32:23.878
- What?

01:32:23.911 --> 01:32:25.179
- I know exactly what I'd say.

01:32:25.212 --> 01:32:26.213
- Liar.

01:32:26.247 --> 01:32:27.248
- I am not lying.

01:32:27.281 --> 01:32:28.049
I'm fighting.

01:32:28.082 --> 01:32:29.750
That's how you get
what you want.

01:32:29.784 --> 01:32:31.585
- Oh, okay. What is it then?
What would you say?

01:32:31.619 --> 01:32:33.354
- I'd say...

01:32:38.993 --> 01:32:43.764
I'd say, "This is Rebecca.

01:32:43.798 --> 01:32:45.633
"We're in love.

01:32:45.666 --> 01:32:47.268
She's in charge now."
