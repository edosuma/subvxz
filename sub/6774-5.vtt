00:00.334 --> 00:03.735
     <i> My name is liv moore,</i>
     <i> and i died, sort of.</i>

00:03.738 --> 00:06.071
   <i> I had a promising career</i>
   <i> and a great fiance.</i>

00:06.073 --> 00:09.375
 <i> Then i went to the world's</i>
 <i> worst boat party</i>
 <i> and got turned into a zombie.</i>

00:09.377 --> 00:11.510
   <i> Now i work at the morgue</i>
   <i> for access to brains,</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.379
       <i> But brain eating</i>
       <i> has side effects.</i>

00:13.381 --> 00:15.214
    <i> I take on the victim's</i>
    <i> personality traits</i>

00:15.216 --> 00:18.017
 <i> And have visions which i use</i>
 <i> to help solve their murders.</i>

00:18.019 --> 00:20.152
   <i> I work with a detective</i>
   <i> who thinks i'm a psychic</i>

00:20.154 --> 00:21.854
     <i> And my boss,</i>
     <i> the medical examiner,</i>

00:21.856 --> 00:24.023
     <i> The only person</i>
     <i> who knows my secret.</i>

00:24.025 --> 00:25.391
 <i> I'm a crime-fighting zombie.</i>

00:25.393 --> 00:27.192
   <i> Previously on</i> izombie...

00:27.194 --> 00:28.894
    Liv: <i> Major is a counselor</i>
   <i> at helton shelter,</i>

00:28.896 --> 00:30.529
      A halfway house
      for teen runaways.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.731
  <i> Jerome's roommate,</i>
  <i> eddie cisco,</i>
  <i> disappeared four days ago.</i>

00:32.732 --> 00:35.234
 All right.
 I'm gonna walk this over
 to missing persons right now.

00:35.236 --> 00:36.869
          Nice kicks.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.204
   Have you seen my friend?

00:38.205 --> 00:39.538
     Blaine: <i> We'll have you</i>
    <i> to him in no time.</i>

00:39.540 --> 00:40.739
        You a size 12?

00:40.741 --> 00:42.875
         -Be my guest.
         -(chuckles)

00:46.814 --> 00:48.447
    -What are we drinking?
    -This is a mezcal

00:48.449 --> 00:50.849
  Made in some remote village
  in south america.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.718
        Mexico. Oaxaca.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.454
  It's really hard to find.
  I mean, there's only, like,
  200 bottles made a year.

00:55.456 --> 00:56.755
   His agent got it for him.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.691
   May we never go to hell,
   but always be on our way.

00:59.693 --> 01:02.361
    (cheering and whooping)

01:04.465 --> 01:05.831
      Red light, people.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.300
    (cheering and whooping)

01:12.706 --> 01:14.740
       -(gasps)
       -live to the max!

01:14.742 --> 01:15.874
             Yeah!

01:17.812 --> 01:19.545
    (police radio chatter)

01:22.116 --> 01:23.715
    (camera shutter clicks)

01:33.961 --> 01:35.527
    Even if i laid out here
    long enough,

01:35.529 --> 01:37.863
  I still wouldn't get a tan.

01:37.865 --> 01:39.898
   I used to have freckles.

01:39.900 --> 01:41.600
      I miss my freckles.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.970
 Two hours.
 Two hours going back and forth
 on extraction.

01:44.972 --> 01:46.905
 Meanwhile, we're in the middle
 of the sticks.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.774
    And i forgot my phone.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.375
        And i'm hungry.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.980
   Of everyone here,
   who would you eat first?

01:56.383 --> 01:59.384
 I think first i'd ask if
 someone could spare an apple.

01:59.386 --> 02:01.887
      Or half a sandwich.

02:01.889 --> 02:05.424
 I was watching tv on saturday
 and i saw
 an egg salad sandwich.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.726
      And i was like,
      "i loved egg salad
      when i was alive."

02:07.728 --> 02:09.761
   There's gotta be
   an equivalent i can make.

02:09.763 --> 02:11.163
    Vegans can pull it off
    with tofu,

02:11.165 --> 02:13.298
     So why can't
     i do it with brains?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.801
 So i went down to the
 artisanal spice shop on pike,

02:15.803 --> 02:17.136
   You know,
   seasons for all seasons,

02:17.138 --> 02:19.271
  And i picked up some stuff.

02:19.273 --> 02:21.006
  In the end,
  the sandwich wasn't so bad.

02:21.008 --> 02:24.076
 It didn't quite hit the mark,
 but kind of close.

02:25.212 --> 02:27.079
     So, work in progress.

02:27.081 --> 02:28.447
        Hashtag, yolo.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.717
  Okay, amuse yourself then.

02:31.719 --> 02:34.686
  I think you might be having
  shish kebab for lunch.
  (chuckles)

02:34.688 --> 02:36.722
  I get it. Food on a stick.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.123
      You're so juvenile.

02:40.127 --> 02:41.627
        -Chicken satay.
        -(chuckles)

02:42.663 --> 02:44.029
       Cocktail wieners.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.398
     Lollipops. Popsicles.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.466
          Cake pops.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.901
     (cell phone ringing)

02:50.671 --> 02:52.070
          Corn dogs!

02:52.072 --> 02:53.805
        Hey, what's up?

02:53.807 --> 02:56.175
    -Peyton: (softly) <i> liv?</i>
    -Peyton? What's wrong?

02:56.911 --> 02:57.976
         Are you okay?

02:57.978 --> 02:59.077
  (sniffles) no, it's not me.

02:59.079 --> 03:01.513
 Uh, holly was in an accident.

03:02.149 --> 03:03.282
        Holly driscoll?

03:03.284 --> 03:05.450
     No, uh, holly white,
     from mu theta zeta.

03:05.452 --> 03:07.186
  Oh, my god. What happened?

03:07.188 --> 03:10.322
  <i> I just started seeing these</i>
  <i> "rip holly" messages</i>
  <i> on my feed.</i>

03:10.324 --> 03:12.357
     Someone said it was
     a skydiving accident.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.766
     (theme song playing)

03:45.092 --> 03:47.459
   Holly and i
   went to college together.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.661
 We were in the same sorority
 for a while.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.096
       Well, you can
       sit this one out.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.397
           I'm fine.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.267
  Man, i thought the insides
  of my thighs were pale.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.104
         Anyway, uh...

03:59.106 --> 04:00.606
      Nothing out of the
      ordinary here.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.874
     Her chute deployed,
     equipment looks good.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.943
   The sport chutes
   they were using were
   dangerous to begin with,

04:04.945 --> 04:07.779
 And this drop zone
 is not for the faint of heart.

04:07.781 --> 04:11.416
   Just your run-of-the-mill
   darwin award.
   Bunch of dumbasses.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.487
 -Incoming.
 -I know you'll chalk this up
 to human error,

04:15.489 --> 04:16.555
       But that's crap.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.523
       Holly's jumped
       a hundred times.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.024
     Something went wrong
     up in the plane.

04:20.027 --> 04:23.128
 She was supposed to go last.
 Instead, that guy...

04:23.130 --> 04:26.231
     Went last. And late.
     Both of them.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.269
  He was nowhere to be found
  after we landed.

04:30.271 --> 04:33.472
 We keep asking what happened,
 but he's not talking.

04:39.079 --> 04:41.113
   Hi, detective babineaux?

04:41.115 --> 04:42.214
      Do you remember me?

04:42.216 --> 04:45.017
       Of course. Major.
       Liv's friend.

04:45.019 --> 04:47.419
    Please, call me clive.
    Have a seat.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.389
    Did, uh, eddie turn up?

04:50.391 --> 04:53.992
    No. That's, uh,
    actually why i'm here.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.862
   Eddie never came home.
   And now jerome's missing.

04:56.864 --> 04:59.998
      He hasn't been
      by helton shelter
      in more than week.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.933
 And i haven't heard from him
 in a few days.

05:01.935 --> 05:03.368
   I tried calling his phone
   this morning,

05:03.370 --> 05:05.237
     But the number's been
     disconnected.

05:05.239 --> 05:06.371
 Have you called the hospitals?

05:06.373 --> 05:07.906
     Checked with friends,
     relatives?

05:07.908 --> 05:10.008
    I... I did all of that.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.810
       You should talk to
       missing persons.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.278
 Major: Yeah, i did that, too.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.180
  Look, you're my last resort.

05:16.050 --> 05:17.582
  Man, i am buried right now.

05:17.584 --> 05:18.984
      I've got two
      open investigations,

05:18.986 --> 05:21.253
   My lieutenant's
   being a hard-ass lately...

05:21.255 --> 05:24.656
   I'm homicide. I go to work
   when there's a body.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.291
    This really is
    a missing persons case.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.859
        They're useless!

05:27.861 --> 05:30.696
      The moment they hear
      "helton shelter,"
      they stop listening.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.465
  -They don't return my calls.
  -Okay.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.300
 I get that you're frustrated.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.103
     They're stretched thin
     over there,

05:38.105 --> 05:39.905
    But i can put a call in
    to my guy

05:39.907 --> 05:42.274
  And get jerome
  moved up the priority list.

05:42.276 --> 05:43.775
    When'd you last see him?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.977
   Uh, it was last thursday.
   (sighs)

05:45.979 --> 05:49.314
     He was headed
     to the skate park,
     to go look for eddie.

05:49.316 --> 05:53.185
    He was wearing
    a gray and blue hoodie,

05:53.187 --> 05:56.688
      Blue t-shirt, jeans
      and sneakers.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.758
    They were american flag
    high tops.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.632
   Do you remember
   the skate park guy that
   jerome was talking about?

06:07.634 --> 06:09.768
  He called him the candyman.
  Said he was scary,

06:09.770 --> 06:12.270
     And that he was
     giving drugs to kids?

06:12.272 --> 06:14.306
    Can...
    Can we not go down there

06:14.308 --> 06:15.841
     And just check him out
     or something?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.010
  I'll let my guy at mpu know.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.246
            (sighs)

06:22.082 --> 06:23.215
            (scoffs)

06:26.553 --> 06:29.654
        Major, don't do
        anything stupid.

06:33.193 --> 06:35.494
       Liv: <i> Holly was</i>
      <i> the opposite of me.</i>

06:35.496 --> 06:37.863
 <i> She was adventurous and free,</i>

06:37.865 --> 06:39.698
  <i> I was disciplined and safe.</i>

06:40.768 --> 06:42.701
     <i> She was unlike anyone</i>
     <i> i'd ever met.</i>

06:47.007 --> 06:49.808
  <i> There wasn't a mu theta rule</i>
  <i> she didn't violate.</i>

06:49.810 --> 06:51.843
       <i> I guess that's why</i>
       <i> we kicked her out.</i>

06:53.714 --> 06:55.981
    <i> Even though</i>
    <i> i didn't understand her,</i>

06:55.983 --> 06:57.849
     <i> Part of me</i>
     <i> wished i could be her.</i>

07:04.091 --> 07:08.260
  You know, you don't have to,
  um... Eat her.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.961
 We're not lacking for options.

07:09.963 --> 07:12.531
  We have the crossing guard,
  the lady who stroked out
  in the park...

07:12.533 --> 07:13.799
           It's fine.

07:16.036 --> 07:18.403
           I mean...

07:18.405 --> 07:22.808
 It is a little weird,
 like i'll be reading her diary
 or something, but...

07:22.810 --> 07:25.310
    I do this for strangers
    all the time.

07:25.312 --> 07:28.780
    If there's someone
    i owe it to, it's holly.

07:28.782 --> 07:32.150
    That friend of hers
    seemed so sure
    this wasn't an accident.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.985
  I have to know
  if someone did this to her.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.557
        (drill whirring)

07:57.177 --> 07:59.911
    Kilimanjaro,
    the cenotes in belize...

07:59.913 --> 08:02.881
   All these profile pictures
   look like a
   <i> national geographic.</i>

08:02.883 --> 08:05.417
  God, what a dumb way to die.
  Ugh.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.986
   Don't jump out of planes.
   Like nature intended.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.554
    You know, if she'd spent
    more time reading

08:09.556 --> 08:11.156
     Than flipping the bird
     to gravity,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.425
    She'd know that you're
    going down when you fly
     too close to the sun.

08:13.427 --> 08:16.228
 Lots of people skydive.
 That doesn't make you icarus.

08:16.230 --> 08:18.697
     True, but holly went
     skydiving, spelunking,

08:18.699 --> 08:20.065
      Base jumping,
      mountain climbing...

08:20.067 --> 08:22.033
   All the dangerous "ings."

08:22.035 --> 08:24.936
 So statistically, she had
 an even greater chance of
 self-destructing than icarus.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.805
 Oh, i'm not being insensitive.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.173
           It's true.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.676
 And yes, it's also true
 that she was funny and smart,

08:32.312 --> 08:34.546
     And beautiful, and...

08:34.548 --> 08:37.782
      Always had your back
      when you needed it.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.150
 That's why i'm so pissed off.
 'cause she threw it away.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.520
    I don't know,
    i think she'd disagree.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.624
    I think she was a dying-
    as-a-consequence-of-life
          kind of girl.

08:45.626 --> 08:47.392
     That's a nice thought.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.261
   But people who say that,
   say that from the comfort
      of their aliveness.

08:49.930 --> 08:51.763
      I remember one time

08:51.765 --> 08:55.267
  She found me wandering
  in a fugue after i got an 89
  on my organic chem lab,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.736
 And i was like,
 "so much for medical school."

08:57.738 --> 09:00.305
  Okay, insane. But i get it.
  Go on.

09:00.307 --> 09:01.706
       And she was like,

09:01.708 --> 09:04.676
 "liv, the grades and crap
 don't matter in the long run.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.245
    "you gotta start sucking
    the marrow out of life."

09:07.247 --> 09:08.480
      And on the way back
      to mu theta,

09:08.482 --> 09:11.883
  We hopped a fence
  and swam in someone's pool.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.786
 Now that i think about it,
 that was one of the best times
 i ever had in college.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.489
    You didn't tell me that!
    I feel so cheated on.

09:17.491 --> 09:20.158
  And yet we both voted
  to kick her out of mu theta.

09:21.361 --> 09:22.561
              Ugh.

09:23.330 --> 09:25.463
     Not our finest moment.

09:25.465 --> 09:28.233
  Okay, but you're forgetting
  how, like,
  over the top she was.

09:28.235 --> 09:30.769
      Remember when she'd
      come crashing home
      at, like, 4:00 a.M.?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.805
 Then she'd leave her naked
 strays on the couch for us to
 find in the morning. Ugh.

09:33.807 --> 09:36.107
       She was just being
       a college student.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.877
  Didn't you ever worry
  she had something
  figured out that we didn't?

09:40.681 --> 09:41.980
            Oh, wow.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.683
 This post is from last night.

09:45.953 --> 09:49.054
    Holly: <i> Look what i found!</i>
   <i> The life of the party.</i>

09:49.056 --> 09:50.889
   <i> Lowell, control yourself.</i>

09:50.891 --> 09:53.558
<i> I haven't heard that beautiful</i>
<i> voice in so long.</i>

09:54.394 --> 09:55.527
         It'll be fine!

09:55.529 --> 09:56.595
 You've done this a thousand...

09:56.597 --> 09:57.963
              Go!

09:57.965 --> 09:59.831
  Peyton: Doesn't it
  freak you out that facebook

09:59.833 --> 10:03.268
 Somehow knows that you
 were thinking of buying boots
 and reducing belly fat?

10:04.638 --> 10:06.004
    I need you to look into
    holly white.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.472
       She's the skydiver
       from yesterday.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.574
      Do you see her name
      in red up there?

10:09.576 --> 10:10.642
      It's not a homicide.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.143
 The faa ruled it an accident.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.746
   That ruling's not official
   until my office weighs in.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.448
      We're still waiting
      on toxicology.

10:16.450 --> 10:19.651
  -In the meantime...
  -In the meantime you want me
  to invent a case.

10:19.653 --> 10:23.421
 I've got two open, liv.
 My lieutenant is a moody dude.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.590
    We can keep things quiet
    till we have something.

10:25.592 --> 10:29.928
   I had a vision. This guy
    that holly jumped with,
   his name's lowell tracey.

10:29.930 --> 10:32.464
  I saw him freak out on her.
  He scared her.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.333
 And one of her friends is sure
 he had something to do
 with her death.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.935
     Please, we have to do
     something.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.637
 She was a friend from college.

10:38.639 --> 10:40.905
       (sighs) all right.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.074
     I've got your back
     until it hits the fan.

10:43.076 --> 10:46.177
 If you haven't noticed,
 i'm not winning any popularity
 contest around here.

10:46.179 --> 10:48.813
  Against my better judgment,
  i'll bring in...

10:48.815 --> 10:51.149
   Lowell tracey. Thank you.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.818
 Oh, and they were wearing
 helmet cams.
 We're gonna need that footage.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.620
     Got it. Anything else?

11:11.972 --> 11:14.406
       (thunder rumbling)

11:14.408 --> 11:16.474
     (upbeat music playing)

11:40.634 --> 11:42.200
         Why am i here?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.902
    It's just an exploratory
    interview.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.603
     Fact-finding
     for the investigation.

11:45.605 --> 11:47.572
    Establishing a timeline.
    That sort of thing.

11:47.574 --> 11:50.075
  "investigation"? So you're
  suggesting that holly was...

11:53.780 --> 11:55.046
              You.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.618
        Sorry i'm late.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.220
     This is olivia moore.

12:02.222 --> 12:03.922
 She's the me on holly's case.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.157
       "liv moore," huh?

12:07.060 --> 12:08.126
             So...

12:08.929 --> 12:10.261
            Do you?

12:10.263 --> 12:12.230
         Are we ready?

12:12.232 --> 12:16.367
 Mr. Tracey, tell me about this
 max rager skydiving group.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.069
 Why's an energy drink company
 footing the bill

12:18.071 --> 12:19.804
      For you to
      jump out of a plane?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.641
       If you're under
       max rager's thumb,

12:23.643 --> 12:26.845
     You are contractually
     obligated to look good

12:26.847 --> 12:31.750
   Doing pointless and or
   dangerous crap on camera.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.852
 How are you under their thumb?

12:33.854 --> 12:37.822
  They put out my last album.
  I'm signed to their label.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.824
      You sound real happy
      about that.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.559
       What happened
       up in that plane?

12:41.561 --> 12:43.895
 Why did you jump last?
 And why couldn't they find you
 when you landed?

12:43.897 --> 12:45.597
  Thank you, detective moore.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.033
 So why didn't holly jump last?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.971
 Why ask when you can just
 watch the helmet cam footage?

12:52.973 --> 12:55.006
  Tell us what we're gonna see
  when it comes in.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.410
   Holly jumped first because

12:59.412 --> 13:02.680
         I got nervous.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.650
     I almost backed down.
     Been a while
     since i last jumped.

13:06.553 --> 13:07.786
  I asked her to go before me.

13:08.488 --> 13:10.255
    "asked" implies nicely.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.458
   Still doesn't cover why
   you went missing for
   30 minutes on the ground.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.727
      I landed away
      from the drop zone.

13:15.729 --> 13:19.397
 Had no idea where i was,
 wandered around until i found
 everybody. Riveting stuff!

13:19.399 --> 13:22.433
   All of which you can watch
   on the helmet cam footage.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.502
     You know what i think
     i'm gonna do?

13:25.772 --> 13:26.905
     Check on the footage.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.949
  Why were you miserable
  at carson's party the night
  before the jump?

13:41.822 --> 13:43.822
       Were you and holly
       sleeping together?

13:50.530 --> 13:52.063
     -Let's talk about you.
     -(scoffs)

13:52.065 --> 13:53.898
      Nah, how about this.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.266
    You answer my question.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.368
   I'll answer a question
   if you answer a question.

13:58.772 --> 14:00.605
        Whatever. Fine.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.408
    I was miserable because
    carson's parties blow,

14:03.410 --> 14:05.710
      And no, i was not
      sleeping with holly.

14:05.712 --> 14:09.013
    She was just my favorite
    person to hang with
    at max rager events.

14:09.015 --> 14:10.281
           She was...

14:11.718 --> 14:12.917
           Genuine...

14:15.155 --> 14:16.421
          And smart...

14:20.327 --> 14:21.993
 Unlike the rest of those guys.

14:25.765 --> 14:26.965
       Now, it's my turn.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.767
    Do you have a boyfriend?

14:30.604 --> 14:32.604
         (door opening)

14:32.606 --> 14:34.372
    Clive: Got some bad news
    for you, rock star.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.176
  Max rager, in their infinite
  wisdom,

14:38.178 --> 14:40.578
   Destroyed all
   the footage from the jump.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.380
     Now what reason would
     they have,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.582
   Other than protecting you,
   to do that?

14:46.319 --> 14:47.819
         Any theories?

14:57.464 --> 14:59.130
 Have you met that guy before?

14:59.132 --> 15:00.531
          Lowell? No.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.367
 Huh... Seems like he knew you.

15:02.369 --> 15:03.635
   What did you think of him?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.937
    Well, he's a smart ass,
    withholding, evasive.

15:05.939 --> 15:08.373
 When you've got nothing
 to hide, you tend to be open.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.475
  Let's bring his friends in,
  find out more about him.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.077
  Just a few basic questions.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.947
  You can start with
  your full name, what you do,

15:15.949 --> 15:18.182
      And your affiliation
      with max rager.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.851
           Ren smith.

15:19.853 --> 15:22.220
   I'm kind of an all around
   action sports guy.

15:22.222 --> 15:24.756
   Mainly motocross.
   Some stunt stuff. X games.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.425
  Uh... Max rager sponsors me.

15:27.427 --> 15:28.760
       It's a dream job.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.929
     I get paid to hang out
     with my friends.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.766
  They're not all my friends,
  i guess.

15:36.202 --> 15:38.770
        Eliza marquette,
        brand marketing,

15:38.772 --> 15:42.206
    Director of advertising
    at max rager.

15:42.208 --> 15:45.476
    Care to shed some light
    on why the dive footage
        was destroyed?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.078
           Of course.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.614
   We wanted to protect
   holly's family from seeing
   images of her

15:49.616 --> 15:51.482
    Plummeting to her death.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.384
 Oh, so it was for their good?

15:53.820 --> 15:55.386
           Ours, too.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.122
  Who would her family sue
  if that footage leaked out?

15:58.124 --> 16:00.391
      Is it typical for
      max rager executives

16:00.393 --> 16:02.660
      To skydive
      with their athletes?

16:02.662 --> 16:05.930
    Not really. But carson's
    my boyfriend, so...

16:07.667 --> 16:10.635
 Carson mccomb. I'm essentially
 in advertising.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.071
   You know,
   i get paid stupid money
   to put my face on things.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.807
 On occasion, i snowboard in
 the olympics and the x games,

16:15.809 --> 16:18.543
   But my face is my passion.

16:18.545 --> 16:21.412
 Training's intense, you know,
 lots of moisturizing and...

16:24.150 --> 16:25.717
        Pro snowboarder.

16:25.719 --> 16:27.552
    It's been suggested that
    lowell tracey

16:27.554 --> 16:31.689
    Was acting strangely
    leading up to the jump.
    Is that accurate?

16:31.691 --> 16:35.493
   The past couple months,
   he's been withdrawn, has
   canceled a couple events,

16:35.495 --> 16:38.930
    But he's really
    a great artist overall.

16:38.932 --> 16:42.633
  Lowell was weird at carson's
  party the night before.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.235
 I don't know if he's on drugs
 or off them.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.504
      You know musicians.
      Either way,

16:46.506 --> 16:48.673
 He was acting like a bitch
 and holly made it her business

16:48.675 --> 16:51.042
      To try and find out
      what was up.

16:51.044 --> 16:53.611
     Were lowell and holly
     involved romantically?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.147
 No. No. I mean,
 she invited him to everything.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.648
 She was really into his music,
 which...

16:57.650 --> 16:59.283
       (snorts) whatever.

16:59.285 --> 17:01.386
   But he just shut her down.

17:01.388 --> 17:04.188
 You know, he was like the
 one guy who could resist her.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.758
     He was the one guy
     who could resist her?

17:06.760 --> 17:07.992
         You're a guy.

17:10.130 --> 17:13.397
    I know everything about
    carson's past fling
    with holly.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.034
   But that's exactly
   what it was, a past fling.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.300
       It was long over.

17:18.171 --> 17:20.371
        Carson and holly
        were not over.

17:20.373 --> 17:24.008
 See, eliza lived in fear
 of holly snapping her fingers
 and getting carson back.

17:24.010 --> 17:25.843
     I... I wasn't sleeping
     with holly.

17:27.881 --> 17:29.080
            Anymore.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.250
    The last time was, like,
    forever ago.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.153
         Six weeks ago.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.687
      Ms. Marquette's
      under the impression

17:36.689 --> 17:39.957
 You've been her one and only
 for the better part of a year.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.527
    Please don't tell eliza.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.328
            Please.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.698
     Please, holly,
     don't make me do this.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.434
     It'll ruin everything
     if it gets out.

17:49.436 --> 17:50.701
      Let's just keep this
      between us.

17:50.703 --> 17:53.337
  You don't know
  how important this is to me.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.739
   Carson:
   This is like vegas, right?

17:54.741 --> 17:55.873
       What happens in
       the interrogation,

17:55.875 --> 17:58.076
  Stays in the interrogation?
  Right?

18:01.214 --> 18:03.281
   All i did was look at him.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.750
   Carson's hiding something.
   I had a vision.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.719
   He was freaking out about
   holly making him
   tell people something.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.088
 And ren was in bed behind him.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.223
  If i had to guess, i'd say
  carson and ren were lovers.

18:12.225 --> 18:14.225
   That's a secret
   he was desperate to keep.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.560
      Who isn't this dude
      sleeping with?

18:15.562 --> 18:16.861
 The pilot who flew the plane?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.697
        Was holly scared
        in your vision?

18:19.699 --> 18:21.332
  Did carson seem threatening?

18:21.334 --> 18:23.801
       No. He was a wuss.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.337
   It was his wussiness
   that triggered my vision.

18:26.339 --> 18:29.107
  Look, we've got a sketchy
  musician, a serial cheater,

18:29.109 --> 18:31.375
      And some destroyed
      eyewitness footage.

18:31.377 --> 18:33.978
       That last bit
       bugs me the most.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.481
     Still, it's not enough
     to call this a murder.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.318
     Liv: <i> By all appearances,</i>
    <i> clive's right.</i>

18:40.887 --> 18:42.286
       <i> I've got nothing.</i>

18:42.288 --> 18:45.289
<i> Just a gut feeling that i need</i>
<i> to keep pulling this thread.</i>

18:47.427 --> 18:48.759
         (cars honking)

18:55.802 --> 18:58.636
      <i> Maybe it was just</i>
      <i> a senseless tragedy.</i>

18:58.638 --> 19:01.405
      <i> If you live each day</i>
      <i> like it's your last,</i>

19:01.407 --> 19:04.609
    <i> Someday you'll be right.</i>

19:04.611 --> 19:07.945
   <i> Maybe i should just try to</i>
   <i> enjoy the last few days</i>
   <i> i have with holly.</i>

19:12.018 --> 19:13.784
   Ah, finally, you're here!

19:13.786 --> 19:15.953
       I've got something
       to show you.

19:15.955 --> 19:19.323
      Babineaux, every
      morning i start with
      a little quiet time.

19:19.325 --> 19:22.193
        Sip my coffee.
        Check instagram.

19:22.195 --> 19:26.030
 I'm on this new diet,
 so i look at pictures of food
 i can't have.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.132
     Some people hate on
     food pictures, not me.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.934
       Bowls of spaghetti
       are my porn.

19:31.738 --> 19:35.573
  I didn't get to enjoy my
  little routine this morning.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.609
  Instead, i was on the phone
  with lawyers from max rager,

19:38.611 --> 19:41.412
 Answering questions about
 a case i didn't know existed.

19:41.414 --> 19:43.814
  Sir, i'm sorry, i know i...
  I should've...

19:43.816 --> 19:45.983
    I'm gonna say this once.

19:45.985 --> 19:49.320
 If it's not
 on the board in red,
 it's somebody else's problem.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.855
        And i don't care
        if come sunday

19:50.857 --> 19:53.824
    You find your own mother
    dead in her kitchen
    with an ax in her head.

19:53.826 --> 19:57.061
 If mama babineaux ain't on
 the board in red, she's what?

19:57.063 --> 19:58.663
    Somebody else's problem.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.565
          Liv: Clive!

20:00.567 --> 20:02.833
    Holly had sodium oxybate
    in her system.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.268
              Ghb?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.938
 Five, ten minutes after she
 ingested it, she'd be useless.

20:06.940 --> 20:09.073
    I can't believe she even
    opened her chute.

20:09.075 --> 20:10.408
          Who are you?

20:10.410 --> 20:12.877
    Liv moore, me's office.

20:12.879 --> 20:15.580
      -You been here long?
      -Yeah, a few months.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.583
              Sir?

20:20.787 --> 20:24.388
  Congratulations, babineaux,
  you managed to get it
  on the board.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.623
       Don't screw it up.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.504
      I'm sorry i got you
      into trouble.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.707
      It's not your fault.
      It's my mo.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.142
   Tomorrow we'll bring in
   the skydiving crew again.

20:45.144 --> 20:46.911
       Given the timing,

20:46.913 --> 20:49.780
   They're the only ones
   who could've dosed holly.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.550
  I'll be at carson's tonight
  for holly's memorial.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.318
    Whoever killed her will
    probably be there, too,

20:54.320 --> 20:57.588
    Eating deli meat off
    a toothpick and talking
    about the good times.

20:57.590 --> 20:59.523
  That's perfect.
  You can take a look around.

20:59.525 --> 21:01.292
  During my friend's memorial?

21:01.294 --> 21:03.861
  We'll never have another
  invitation to carson's house
  without a warrant.

21:04.631 --> 21:06.264
 Just keep that third eye open.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.838
       Oh, there's major.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.240
        Can we go over?
        How are you two?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.509
     In the throes
     of awkward friendship.

21:18.511 --> 21:20.378
           -Perfect.
           -(scoffs)

21:20.380 --> 21:21.946
           -Hey you.
           -Hey.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.585
 You're the only one here who
 looks like someone just died.

21:27.587 --> 21:29.487
        Sorry, my mind's
        somewhere else.

21:29.489 --> 21:30.955
      No word from jerome?

21:33.426 --> 21:35.126
    See anyone we know here?

21:35.128 --> 21:36.927
   Yeah,
   it's like a udub reunion.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.597
     Everyone's rising
     to the occasion, which
     holly would've wanted.

21:39.599 --> 21:41.332
     What, think we'll find
     a keg in the bathtub?

21:41.334 --> 21:45.269
  No, but i heard rumors that
  there'd be streaking.
  In holly's honor.

21:45.271 --> 21:47.071
           Seriously?

21:47.073 --> 21:50.041
   Smart phones have cameras.
   Is no one here planning
   a career in politics?

21:51.311 --> 21:52.376
            (sighs)

21:53.079 --> 21:54.145
         Look at these.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.315
          Holly, why?

21:57.317 --> 21:59.784
    It's so out of character
    for you to be dead.

22:01.087 --> 22:02.453
         Vodka. Where?

22:02.455 --> 22:03.988
           Follow me.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.956
        -Liv?
        -I'll catch up.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.191
             Okay.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.373
           Um... Hi.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.009
     Can't say i expected
     seattle pd to be here.

22:25.011 --> 22:27.745
 Just came to pay my respects.
 Like you.

22:27.747 --> 22:31.482
    Somehow, a strange cop
    at holly's memorial
    doesn't feel respectful.

22:31.484 --> 22:34.218
 Yeah, uh...
 Bordering on sleazy, actually.

22:35.254 --> 22:37.154
      Sorry, i don't mean
      to be rude,

22:37.156 --> 22:39.890
   But i think
   you should probably leave.

22:39.892 --> 22:42.860
  We set this up for
  holly's friends and family.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.929
 I am holly's friend, actually.

22:44.931 --> 22:47.398
  And considering one of you
  drugged her before the jump,

22:47.400 --> 22:50.368
  I may be the best friend she
  had in this 10-foot radius.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.338
      Eliza: Drugged her?

22:54.807 --> 22:55.873
        What'd she say?

22:57.610 --> 22:58.676
            (sighs)

23:28.608 --> 23:30.174
       Liv: <i> Valacyclovir.</i>

23:30.176 --> 23:32.943
  <i> Funny, i saw everything but</i>
  <i> a herpes ad around here.</i>

23:56.502 --> 23:58.302
     Ah, addy for the exec.

23:59.906 --> 24:02.273
  Ooh! Uppers for the downer.

24:02.275 --> 24:03.507
      Ooh! (all laughing)

24:10.483 --> 24:12.316
      (cell phone ringing)

24:12.318 --> 24:13.918
 Man on tv: <i> Where do we begin?</i>

24:15.221 --> 24:18.022
       -Hello?
       -Liv: <i> Hey, i just</i>
       <i> found carson's</i>

24:18.024 --> 24:19.957
 Personal stash
 of blank prescription sheets.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.626
   They're pre-signed by a...
   Dr. Dean mccomb?

24:23.262 --> 24:24.895
      I'm guessing daddy.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.630
   But any of the jump crew
   could have gotten the ghb.

24:26.632 --> 24:29.633
  They all had access
  to the prescription papers.

24:29.635 --> 24:33.537
 Can you check local pharmacies
 for sodium oxybate scripts
 written by dr. Mccomb?

24:33.539 --> 24:35.272
             -On it.
            <i> -Great.</i>

24:35.274 --> 24:36.740
         See ya later.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.544
       Well, well, well.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.582
       I, uh... I was...

24:46.252 --> 24:47.651
           Bathroom?

24:47.653 --> 24:49.453
   It's down there somewhere.
   Have another look.

24:52.291 --> 24:53.757
      Join me for a drink.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.130
 I heard that holly was drugged
 before the jump.

25:02.101 --> 25:03.434
        I also heard...

25:04.170 --> 25:05.903
  You were friends in college.

25:09.575 --> 25:10.791
 We were in the same sorority.

25:10.792 --> 25:12.008
  The chicks who banished her
  for not being
  a model sorority girl.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.678
  You know, i feel someone
  should inform the mu thetas,

25:14.680 --> 25:17.948
  That streaking and sleeping
  around is model behavior

25:17.950 --> 25:20.684
  According to every
  american college movie ever.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.855
 So how'd you vote? Yay or nay?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.458
    I didn't think of it
    as banishing. I just...

25:27.460 --> 25:29.293
   It's... My room was above
   the living room

25:29.295 --> 25:31.662
  And she'd play music in the
  middle of the night and...

25:31.664 --> 25:35.065
    There were nights before
    exams when i got
    maybe two hours sleep.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.202
     I wish i hadn't voted
     the way i did.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.904
  They're stupid reasons now.

25:42.441 --> 25:44.975
    Couldn't have been
    easy for you,
    doing an autopsy on her.

25:44.977 --> 25:46.377
      I'm sorry you had to
      see her like that.

25:47.513 --> 25:48.712
            Me, too.

25:49.649 --> 25:50.981
     Were you good friends?

25:51.984 --> 25:53.484
        Getting better.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.254
    You know, we'd always do
    a shot before a jump.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.723
  Take turns bringing a bottle
  of hard-to-find whatever.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.358
       It was tradition.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.460
    That's when
    she could've been dosed.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.930
       Whose turn was it?

26:06.933 --> 26:08.332
           Carson's.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.767
        Brought mezcal.

26:11.103 --> 26:12.570
     Did he pour the shots?

26:14.874 --> 26:18.342
   I, uh, don't remember.
   I was
   a little bit preoccupied.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.978
 So carson and ren
 are in a secret relationship.

26:20.980 --> 26:22.713
       I wouldn't call it
       a relationship.

26:22.715 --> 26:26.050
 But, uh, whatever it was,
 it was a not-so-secret secret.

26:26.052 --> 26:29.687
      Something that, uh,
      friends know about,
      but the world can't.

26:31.624 --> 26:33.824
     Well, until just now.

26:33.826 --> 26:36.560
    I am reckless in pursuit
    of brownie points.

26:36.562 --> 26:39.296
     You think telling me
     all this will make you
     look less guilty?

26:39.298 --> 26:42.366
  I think telling you all this
  gets me a better shot
  at a date.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.305
       Why did ren think
       you were to blame?

26:48.307 --> 26:51.609
 They all said
 that you'd been acting weird,
 that you'd changed.

26:52.545 --> 26:53.911
     Well, i have changed.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.647
      Quite dramatically,
      as a matter of fact.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.588
       Had to completely
       reassess my life.

27:05.658 --> 27:07.224
    You know what it's like.

27:12.565 --> 27:14.231
          This is hot.

27:14.233 --> 27:16.100
   Perks of dating a zombie.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.603
            -Cheers.
            -(gasps)

27:28.447 --> 27:29.813
 <i> The perks of dating a zombie.</i>

27:29.815 --> 27:31.915
  That's that movie with
  the <i> about a boy</i> kid, right?

27:31.917 --> 27:33.384
      That's <i> warm bodies.</i>

27:34.487 --> 27:37.388
     -Oh, yeah.
     -A for effort though.

27:37.390 --> 27:41.458
   But the white blonde hair,
   pale skin,

27:41.460 --> 27:44.028
   Obsessively trimmed nails.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.929
  I knew the moment i saw you.

27:45.931 --> 27:47.231
       Your hair's dark.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.033
           I dye it.

27:50.236 --> 27:51.602
     Yeah, i'd look freaky
     as a blonde.

27:51.604 --> 27:53.637
  You can see my skunk stripe
  coming through.

27:53.639 --> 27:55.839
     So we're both zombies?

27:59.912 --> 28:03.347
   That doesn't
   make you innocent though.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.483
   I saw you yelling at holly
   in the plane.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.386
 -You ate holly's...
 -I had to know what happened.

28:09.388 --> 28:11.555
          Fair enough.

28:11.557 --> 28:13.524
     Okay, so have you had
     one of those...

28:14.627 --> 28:16.460
 Psychotic zombie moments yet?

28:17.496 --> 28:18.996
 Eyes go red, brain turns off?

28:18.998 --> 28:20.064
      Full-on zombie mode.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.765
            (laughs)

28:21.767 --> 28:24.968
     Is that the preferred
     nomenclature?

28:24.970 --> 28:28.872
 I started to go
 into zombie mode on the plane.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.941
 My adrenaline was going,
 i could feel myself changing.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.243
 I wanted holly to jump
 so she could get away from me.

28:33.245 --> 28:35.846
  Then i didn't want to be
  near the pilot, so i jumped.

28:35.848 --> 28:38.816
  Went full-on,
  frothing-at-the-mouth zombie
  on the way down.

28:40.619 --> 28:43.120
 On the ground,
 i waited to find the others
 until i was safe to be around.

28:43.122 --> 28:44.955
    Unfortunately,
    when they wanted to know
    where the hell i was,

28:44.957 --> 28:46.924
 I couldn't say,
 "sorry guys, zombie problems."

28:47.526 --> 28:49.326
       Oh, there you are.

28:50.329 --> 28:52.196
      I'm gonna take off.

28:52.198 --> 28:53.464
 I just wanted to say goodbye.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.333
       I'll walk you out.

29:05.878 --> 29:08.912
 You're leaving awfully early.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.482
 Yeah, i'm really bringing down
 this wake.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.753
     I can't stop thinking
     about jerome.

29:16.822 --> 29:18.388
     It's been over a week.

29:19.592 --> 29:21.158
     He's stopped texting.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.096
   I think something happened
   to him.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.307
         He'll turn up.

29:41.680 --> 29:45.582
   I'm sorry if i interrupted
   something back there.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.185
   What?
   No, that was work-related.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.522
 It's bound to happen someday.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.071
            Five-oh!

30:08.641 --> 30:09.840
         Darius wilson.

30:11.610 --> 30:13.043
    Get your butt over here.

30:14.246 --> 30:15.879
    Why aren't you home, d?

30:15.881 --> 30:17.781
 C'mon, man. What do you want?

30:19.118 --> 30:21.084
  (sighs) do you know jerome?

30:21.086 --> 30:23.854
      -You seen him?
      -Nah, he ain't
      been around lately.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.923
  And no,
  i don't know where he went.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.424
   Just like everybody else.

30:27.426 --> 30:28.892
       What do you mean,
       everybody else?

30:28.894 --> 30:32.029
  We got lots of people gone.
  Even willy the wino's gone.

30:32.765 --> 30:34.264
   What's willy's last name?

30:34.934 --> 30:35.999
          "the wino"?

30:37.403 --> 30:38.702
  Man, the hell i don't know!

30:38.704 --> 30:40.270
  He's just a drunk dude
  that's always yelling at us.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.772
    He says,
    "are we having fun yet?"

30:41.774 --> 30:43.941
   Come on, d, i need names.
   Who else?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.573
    Get anywhere
    in the pharmacy search?

31:16.575 --> 31:17.774
              Yes.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.476
     I didn't find anything
     in seattle,

31:19.478 --> 31:21.311
    But i expanded my search
    and got a match

31:21.313 --> 31:23.881
      For a compounding
      pharmacy in tacoma.

31:23.883 --> 31:26.817
  They're gonna fax the name
  on the prescription
  and then we have our killer.

31:26.819 --> 31:28.385
        -You're welcome.
        -Great.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.757
     I met another zombie.

31:33.759 --> 31:36.226
           -Friendly?
           -Quite.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.229
    Brilliant! Bring him in.
    Expand our data pool.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.797
  Did he have the same pallor?

31:40.799 --> 31:43.734
       White blonde hair,
       depressive affect?

31:43.736 --> 31:46.336
   -He had really blue eyes.
   -Interesting.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.705
     We've yet to encounter
     a brown-eyed zombie.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.407
    Might be
    an empirical regularity.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.676
  How did he sustain himself?
  What's his food source?

31:53.379 --> 31:55.279
       I didn't ask, i...

31:55.281 --> 31:56.914
    Guess i wasn't thinking
    about that.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.315
 What were you thinking about?

31:58.317 --> 32:00.017
       I don't know, i...

32:01.086 --> 32:02.519
     Well, he's just, um...

32:03.923 --> 32:05.756
              Oh.

32:05.758 --> 32:08.725
     Was the zombie subject
     in question hot?

32:08.727 --> 32:10.661
       -He asked me out.
       -You liked it!

32:10.663 --> 32:12.195
            No! Yes.

32:12.865 --> 32:14.531
         I don't know.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.667
     I kind of thought
     my love life was over.

32:16.669 --> 32:20.737
  What if our hot zombie boy's
  name's on our fax

32:20.739 --> 32:22.539
     And he's our murderer?

32:22.541 --> 32:25.575
   I don't think it will be.
   I have a good feeling
   about him.

32:25.577 --> 32:28.879
 Mmm. And where exactly is
 this feeling originating from?

32:28.881 --> 32:30.814
     I'm never telling you
     anything again.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.783
      What, so all zombies
      are killers now?

32:32.785 --> 32:34.318
    -(fax machine whirring)
    -oh!

32:34.320 --> 32:36.987
  Here's our keyser soze now!

32:36.989 --> 32:38.855
      -(drumming fingers)
      -stop that.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.094
         Carson mccomb.

32:46.332 --> 32:47.631
    Clive: I had a chance to
    check out some of your

32:47.633 --> 32:48.899
      Snowboarding videos.

32:48.901 --> 32:50.500
       You're damn good.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.302
          Uh, thanks.

32:52.304 --> 32:55.238
   How long have you been
   handing out prescriptions
   like christmas presents?

32:55.240 --> 32:57.874
   (stuttering) i don't know
   what you're talking about.

32:57.876 --> 32:59.843
    Two-time gold medalist.

32:59.845 --> 33:03.447
  Got dough rolling in
  from fancy watch companies,
  luxury cars.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.215
      What a waste
      of money and talent.

33:05.217 --> 33:06.583
       What do you mean?

33:06.585 --> 33:08.318
  I mean, you were scared your
  sponsors were gonna pull out

33:08.320 --> 33:10.787
     If they heard you and
     ren smith were, um...

33:11.690 --> 33:13.991
     Romantically involved.

33:13.993 --> 33:17.394
      Holly was going to
      spill your secret,
      so you shut her up.

33:17.396 --> 33:22.265
    You gave her a shot of
    mezcal dosed with ghb
    right before she jumped.

33:22.267 --> 33:23.934
     Oh, dude,
     none of that is true.

33:30.909 --> 33:34.378
   That's the prescription
   for ghb you picked up
   two days before the jump.

33:34.380 --> 33:36.580
 Oh, but that's not my
 handwriting. This isn't mine.

33:36.582 --> 33:39.116
  That piece of paper alone
  gets you prescription fraud,

33:39.118 --> 33:42.185
 Illegal distribution of
 prescription drugs, forgery...

33:42.187 --> 33:43.820
    Liv: And that's not all.

33:43.822 --> 33:46.289
 Daddy mccomb is out of a job.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.025
  There's no way he's keeping
  his medical license

33:48.027 --> 33:50.360
   After you went all oprah
   with his prescription pad.

33:50.362 --> 33:52.963
   If you thought getting rid
   of holly would protect
   your endorsements,

33:52.965 --> 33:54.431
    Try protecting them now.

33:54.433 --> 33:57.300
    Well, i didn't write
    a prescription for ghb!

33:57.302 --> 33:59.202
        Wait a minute.
        Eliza must have.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.204
       Why would eliza
       wanna kill holly?

34:01.206 --> 34:02.739
     Because you were still
     hooking up with her?

34:02.741 --> 34:04.708
  No, no. It's her stupid job.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.476
    It... It is like a cult
    over there at max rager.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.745
    It's not just a company,
    it is a lifestyle.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.547
  What does that have to do
  with holly?

34:10.549 --> 34:14.150
    A few weeks ago, i was
    accidentally copied on
    a max rager email chain.

34:14.152 --> 34:17.487
    It's this secret report
    about max rager making
    one in a thousand people

34:17.489 --> 34:18.822
         Go psychotic.

34:18.824 --> 34:20.924
   One guy even died,
   or tried to kill someone.

34:20.926 --> 34:23.460
     I was with holly
     when i got the email,
     so i let her read it.

34:23.462 --> 34:24.895
   She started freaking out,
   saying that max rager

34:24.897 --> 34:26.463
      Was gonna cover
      the whole thing up,

34:26.465 --> 34:28.864
 And that i needed to forward
 the email to some journalist.

34:28.867 --> 34:30.801
     And if i didn't do it,
     she would!

34:30.803 --> 34:32.302
   But that's insane, right?

34:32.304 --> 34:34.571
    Ratting out the company
    that pays my bills?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.606
  So i told eliza about holly.

34:36.608 --> 34:38.341
    I thought she could talk
    holly out of it.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.976
      Eliza said she would
      take care of it.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.679
  I did not know
  she meant "take care of it"
  tony-soprano style!

34:46.685 --> 34:48.652
      I'm gonna go pick up
      miss marquette.

34:48.654 --> 34:51.353
      Stay with him.
      I'll send a uniform.

34:51.356 --> 34:53.223
       We'll hold him
       as long as we can.

35:10.109 --> 35:12.576
    That's weird,
    shower curtain is gone.

35:15.814 --> 35:16.980
           Still wet.

35:16.982 --> 35:18.348
       (oven timer dings)

35:24.990 --> 35:26.456
           (sizzling)

35:29.261 --> 35:31.495
     I don't think she was
     planning on leaving.

35:39.705 --> 35:44.207
  We have security footage
  of eliza picking up the ghb
  prescription in tacoma.

35:44.209 --> 35:45.909
       She's our killer.

35:45.911 --> 35:49.412
  Turned up nothing
  at her place. Clothes gone,
  no ids, no computer.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.814
  I'll put out an apb on her.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.717
       She's on the run.
       We'll get her.

35:53.719 --> 35:55.285
    I'm not so sure we will.

35:55.721 --> 35:56.920
              Sir?

35:58.323 --> 36:00.757
      Congrats, babineaux.
      Job well done.

36:00.759 --> 36:02.225
        Thank you, sir.

36:04.863 --> 36:06.396
             Uh...

36:06.398 --> 36:09.366
 There's something else
 i'd like to talk to you about.

36:09.368 --> 36:12.035
  I've been looking into this
  missing kid on my own time.

36:12.037 --> 36:13.537
         Jerome elliot.

36:13.539 --> 36:16.506
  He was last seen
  downtown at the skate park.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.608
    There's something shady
    going on down there.

36:18.610 --> 36:20.043
       I've never seen
       anything like it.

36:20.045 --> 36:22.579
  There's over 60 outstanding
  missing persons reports

36:22.581 --> 36:24.881
    In the past six months.

36:24.883 --> 36:29.186
   That's three times
   the number reported in
   the preceding six months.

36:29.188 --> 36:31.087
 Now, i know it's
 a transient community, but...

36:31.089 --> 36:35.458
  I don't remember signing off
  on your transfer
  to missing persons.

36:35.460 --> 36:38.295
   I've been looking into it
   on my own time, sir.

36:38.297 --> 36:41.097
 Well, here in homicide, we go
 to work when there's a body.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.933
   Only when there's a body.

36:44.203 --> 36:45.435
 Shut the door on your way out.

37:06.058 --> 37:08.625
  -(man laughs)
  -(indistinct conversations)

37:21.306 --> 37:22.439
              Hey.

37:24.109 --> 37:25.675
  Where'd you get those shoes?

37:27.479 --> 37:28.545
             Ebay.

37:29.147 --> 37:30.680
            Really?

37:30.682 --> 37:31.881
 How much did you pay for 'em?

37:31.883 --> 37:33.216
       I'm looking to get
       a pair like that.

37:33.218 --> 37:35.285
 Too bad, i got the last pair.

37:36.288 --> 37:37.554
              Hey.

37:40.158 --> 37:42.292
   You wanna try touching me
   again, you little bitch?

37:44.329 --> 37:46.229
  You didn't buy those shoes.

37:46.231 --> 37:47.797
     Come to think of it...

37:49.001 --> 37:50.200
             Nope.

37:50.669 --> 37:51.935
           (grunting)

37:55.674 --> 37:56.873
            (groans)

37:56.875 --> 37:58.275
            Get up.

38:06.118 --> 38:07.317
            (grunts)

38:08.320 --> 38:09.586
         (major groans)

38:28.607 --> 38:30.907
      Uh, i think
      you've got company.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.878
     -(whispers) it's him!
     -Ooh!

38:34.880 --> 38:36.279
    Shut up or i'll eat you.

38:38.483 --> 38:39.883
             -Hey!
             -Hey.

38:44.423 --> 38:45.806
              Wow.

38:45.807 --> 38:47.190
 Nothing like a guy seeing you
 with a handful of spleen.

38:47.192 --> 38:48.358
           (chuckles)

38:50.595 --> 38:54.431
   Uh, i hope you don't mind,
   i wanted to bring you
   something.

38:58.337 --> 38:59.869
      "beelzebub's burn."

38:59.871 --> 39:02.972
 Made with the world's hottest
 chili pepper, the jolokia.

39:02.974 --> 39:04.941
    The salesman promised me
    that it would

39:05.510 --> 39:06.776
       Burn my face off,

39:06.778 --> 39:09.512
 Uh, make me cry,
 and turn my organs into jelly.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.014
      -(chuckles)
      -so that's something
      to look forward to.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.049
           Thank you.

39:15.420 --> 39:16.753
          Okay, um...

39:18.924 --> 39:20.357
     So here's the speech.

39:22.160 --> 39:25.061
  The zombie thing is a bitch.

39:25.063 --> 39:29.466
     Your world shrivels
     down to a dot.
     You know this, and...

39:29.468 --> 39:33.236
   All you think about is
   how to get your next meal,
   and keeping your secret.

39:33.238 --> 39:35.105
             And...

39:35.107 --> 39:36.373
      No one can really...

39:37.376 --> 39:38.441
           Know you.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.577
              Now.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.649
 Kissing, touching, sex, love,

39:46.651 --> 39:48.451
   Yelling at someone
   for stealing the blankets.

39:48.453 --> 39:50.186
    Um, out of the question.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.288
            Forever.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.023
 But then one day i see this...

39:58.263 --> 39:59.329
        Beautiful woman.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.565
 She's the only thing in color.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.103
   Odd 'cause she's so pale.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.405
            (laughs)

40:09.941 --> 40:12.075
      And then suddenly
      there's hope again.

40:14.579 --> 40:16.980
     That's all i'm saying.

40:16.982 --> 40:18.882
  Who knows if
  we'll even like each other.

40:18.884 --> 40:23.186
  But i like everything
  i've seen so far, and, um...

40:24.556 --> 40:27.023
   What have we got to lose?

40:27.025 --> 40:28.158
        (door slamming)

40:28.160 --> 40:29.426
          Here ya go.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.729
   New customer. Duty calls.

40:35.801 --> 40:39.903
    I am free this weekend
    and i have your number.

40:39.905 --> 40:42.839
  I'll only hover by the phone
  for the next 72 hours or so.

40:42.841 --> 40:44.908
  After that i'm on to
  the next zombie girl, so...

40:44.910 --> 40:46.276
            (laughs)

  Liv: <i> Lowell could turn out</i>
 <i> to be nothing. Or everything.</i>

40:57.255 --> 40:58.688
  <i> He may even break my heart.</i>

40:58.690 --> 41:01.424
       <i> But any of that</i>
       <i> sounds good to me.</i>

41:01.426 --> 41:05.094
    <i> I'm ready to feel again.</i>
    <i> Anything, good or bad.</i>

41:08.600 --> 41:11.334
      <i> I want to be alive,</i>
      <i> now more than ever.</i>
