party, have a nice night.

13:09.248 --> 13:10.618
Hit me again.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.216
Hey!

13:25.222 --> 13:26.102
You okay?

13:27.641 --> 13:28.221
Hello there.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.770
I think you
could use a ride home.

13:31.771 --> 13:32.560
No.

13:32.563 --> 13:33.273
No, no.

13:33.274 --> 13:35.112
I'm an excellent drunk driver.

13:39.570 --> 13:40.070
Hey.
Come on.

13:42.239 --> 13:43.489
Let's go.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.408
Switch with me.

13:45.409 --> 13:46.576
Alright.

13:46.577 --> 13:48.157
I mean,
on the news, the governors

13:48.162 --> 13:49.702
in Washington saying
they got all this money,

13:49.705 --> 13:51.914
I put in my claim five months
ago, I still got nothing.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.754
I mean I'm staying in
Glasboro with my sister.

13:54.755 --> 13:57.252
The house is a wreck, the first
floor has mud on the floor,

13:57.254 --> 13:58.796
and it has to be gutted.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.627
The whole thing is just,
it just gets to a point

14:00.632 --> 14:04.385
where you just wonder,
is it time to give it up?

14:04.386 --> 14:05.886
Go find work somewhere else.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.758
God, I lived there
my whole life.

14:15.439 --> 14:17.899
Um, hi, Ma'am.

14:18.317 --> 14:19.277
Uh, your husband...

14:19.278 --> 14:20.436
He's not my husband.

14:20.444 --> 14:21.991
I'm not, she's not my,

14:21.992 --> 14:23.527
I'm not her husband.
Oh.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.240
I run his company.

14:24.241 --> 14:28.329
Honey, I'm home.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.202
Is he drunk?

14:34.875 --> 14:38.753
Of all the things
I own, this spot,

14:38.754 --> 14:41.506
the best thing I
ever spent money on.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.877
It's a hell of a view.

14:42.883 --> 14:47.220
Yeah, it took a beating during
the storm, but we rebuilt.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.101
Here you go.

14:48.102 --> 14:49.507
Oh, um, thanks.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.350
Coffee? Come on.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.351
Thank you for driving him.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.353
Yeah.

15:00.359 --> 15:01.189
Ah.

15:02.694 --> 15:06.280
You should really try that.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.371
It's Belvenie, thirty years old.

15:08.372 --> 15:10.117
It's a limited edition.

15:15.040 --> 15:15.830
Oh.

15:15.833 --> 15:16.583
Oh?

15:16.584 --> 15:18.167
Yeah.

15:18.168 --> 15:20.708
This is amazing, right?
It's good.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.132
I am so hungry.

15:23.215 --> 15:24.423
Yeah?

15:24.424 --> 15:25.934
Are you hungry?

15:26.927 --> 15:28.177
So, one of my mentors
in culinary school

15:28.178 --> 15:32.056
told me cuisine is the
mark of a healthy society.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.177
Barbarians, Vikings, aren't
known for their food.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.563
If you're focused on survival,
you only have time for,

15:36.564 --> 15:37.602
for what's good enough.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.898
But cuisine isn't about
what's good enough.

15:40.899 --> 15:43.317
It's about how good can it be.

15:43.318 --> 15:44.735
You went to culinary school?

15:44.736 --> 15:45.696
New York.

15:45.697 --> 15:47.486
Oh, mmm, thank you.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.740
Oh, my god.

15:51.743 --> 15:52.833
I have had eggs like
a million times.

15:52.834 --> 15:55.408
They've never been so soft.

15:56.665 --> 15:57.335
You outta open your own place.

15:57.336 --> 15:59.167
I did.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.418
You did, what happened?

16:00.419 --> 16:01.377
I'm workin' in my Dad's kitchen,

16:01.378 --> 16:02.298
what do you think happened?

16:02.299 --> 16:03.746
Well, you've got talent.

16:03.755 --> 16:05.343
In my experience, talent
and hard work rarely pay off.

16:05.344 --> 16:06.380
Connections, capital
and willingness

16:06.383 --> 16:09.427
to appeal to the lowest
common denominator?

16:09.428 --> 16:10.298
Cha-ching.

16:12.431 --> 16:14.771
Uh, thank you for the drink,

16:16.226 --> 16:17.886
but I should probably go, I
got some friends waiting on me.

16:17.895 --> 16:19.228
Now, where you headed?

16:19.229 --> 16:20.189
The Clove.

16:20.189 --> 16:21.149
Can I come?

16:26.904 --> 16:28.154
Hey!

16:28.155 --> 16:29.363
This is my friend, Mister Blake.

16:29.364 --> 16:30.162
Hi, Tom.

16:30.163 --> 16:30.907
Tom.

16:30.908 --> 16:32.278
Nice to meet you.

16:33.285 --> 16:34.455
How's it goin'?

16:35.037 --> 16:37.157
Next round is on me.

16:43.253 --> 16:47.632
♪ You know you got me
goin' out of my mind

16:47.633 --> 16:50.053
♪ And I would take a
bullet for these fancy lies

16:50.054 --> 16:54.262
♪ You know you got me
goin' out of my mind

16:55.641 --> 16:56.471
Six shots.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.226
Yeah.

16:58.227 --> 16:59.017
I need money.

16:59.019 --> 17:00.309
How much?

17:00.312 --> 17:00.982
Uh, like, like, 30?

17:00.983 --> 17:03.309
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey!

17:03.315 --> 17:03.815
Hey, hey, hey!

17:03.816 --> 17:05.358
I got it!

17:16.411 --> 17:16.901
Alright.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.180
What, what, hey!

17:39.184 --> 17:40.643
What the hell are you doin'?

17:40.644 --> 17:41.234
Just zippin' up.

17:41.235 --> 17:42.687
Just get in the car.

17:42.688 --> 17:44.358
Get in, get in, get in, get in!

17:44.359 --> 17:46.226
Hey, come back here.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.400
Bye.

17:50.112 --> 17:52.862
This is a crazy fucking city!

17:52.864 --> 17:53.994
Yeah! Whoo!

17:56.285 --> 17:57.205
I haven't done
that in a long time.

17:57.206 --> 17:59.452
Make out with a
girl half your age?

17:59.454 --> 18:02.044
No, just go out and have
fun just for the hell of it.

18:02.045 --> 18:03.207
People I like.

18:03.208 --> 18:03.868
I thought maybe that
girl at your house,

18:03.875 --> 18:05.876
maybe you two had a...

18:05.877 --> 18:07.247
Charlie? No.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.054
Huh?

18:08.055 --> 18:09.255
It's all business with her.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.546
She just stays at the
shore house during

18:10.549 --> 18:12.129
the summer 'cause our
office is in Philly.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.554
Most of the people I spend
time with are just business,

18:13.555 --> 18:16.721
they're not my friends,
they're not my kind of people.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.765
Me and my "fuck-wad"
friends are?

18:19.766 --> 18:21.726
More than you know.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.744
You went out
clubbing last night?

18:37.745 --> 18:39.493
Yeah, I did.

18:39.494 --> 18:42.413
It's time to leave for
work in a few minutes.

18:42.414 --> 18:43.831
Relax, Dad.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.372
I'll be ready in a few minutes.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.584
Just blowin' off a little steam.

18:46.585 --> 18:48.505
It's not like I'm not
working hard, Dad.

18:48.506 --> 18:49.920
Just trust me.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.090
Heard that before.

18:51.091 --> 18:53.299
Now, my Dad was
at that restaurant

18:53.300 --> 18:56.050
seven days a week
building up; Me, too.

18:56.053 --> 19:00.097
I thought you said
after the storm,

19:00.098 --> 19:01.718
after what happened,

19:02.893 --> 19:05.393
we were all gonna work together.

19:07.230 --> 19:10.940
Sarah, it's Mom.

19:10.942 --> 19:13.112
Are you coming by today?

19:14.029 --> 19:16.239
They say tomorrow
may be another scan.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.326
I hope to see you.

19:21.787 --> 19:23.497
I love you.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.441
The Prescott's.

19:47.442 --> 19:48.727
David and Barbara.

19:48.730 --> 19:49.310
They have their own firm.

19:49.314 --> 19:50.815
Okay, good.

19:50.816 --> 19:51.316
The Coleman's.

19:51.317 --> 19:52.775
Greta and David.

19:52.776 --> 19:53.976
Real estate.

19:53.985 --> 19:54.985
Good, Pop.

19:54.986 --> 19:55.776
Teddy.

19:55.779 --> 19:57.069
Widowed.

19:57.072 --> 19:59.160
Former "Goldman-Sachs"
from New York.

19:59.161 --> 20:00.407
Very good, honey.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.617
Uh, Tom Blake.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.448
The guy that we
met the other night?

20:02.452 --> 20:03.452
Uh-huh.

20:03.453 --> 20:05.079
I don't know.

20:05.080 --> 20:05.830
Zip me up?

20:05.831 --> 20:06.956
Yeah, okay.

20:06.957 --> 20:07.747
Tom Blake, venture capitalist.

20:07.749 --> 20:10.376
Deep pockets.

20:10.377 --> 20:11.667
What should I know?

20:11.670 --> 20:13.460
Uh, nobody knows
how he got his money.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.842
I think his wife
died in an accident.

20:15.843 --> 20:18.175
Heard it's a tragic story,
don't bring up his past.

20:18.176 --> 20:19.586
I want to keep him
talking about business.

20:19.594 --> 20:21.354
I don't want it to
get all serious.

20:21.355 --> 20:23.506
Okay, who's next?

20:23.515 --> 20:27.685
The Rubens.

20:27.686 --> 20:29.516
Babe, come on.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.561
We're getting our
game face on here.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.982
I need your charm.

20:32.983 --> 20:35.860
These guys love talkin' to you.

20:35.861 --> 20:36.901
What is it?

20:42.993 --> 20:43.873
Yeah.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.334
I know.

20:50.709 --> 20:54.459
I thought we were gonna
try moving on from this.

20:54.463 --> 20:55.588
I know.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.548
I miss her, too.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.508
You know what I think?

20:59.509 --> 21:02.969
I think you need
to occupy yourself.

21:02.971 --> 21:04.891
What about that store you're
gonna open for all this?

21:04.892 --> 21:06.348
What would you need
to get started?

21:06.349 --> 21:07.179
Money.

21:07.184 --> 21:08.354
Let's see, four months rent,

21:08.355 --> 21:11.270
plus security
deposit, that's 10K.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.901
What do you spend on
materials here a month?

21:12.902 --> 21:14.018
It depends.

21:14.024 --> 21:15.784
On average, what do you spend?

21:15.785 --> 21:17.485
Uh, 1,500?

21:17.486 --> 21:19.945
Okay, 1,500 times four,
plus you gotta pay yourself.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.446
Early employee advertising.

21:21.448 --> 21:23.238
Let's make it a nice round 30K.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.617
Sound good?

21:24.618 --> 21:26.868
So, I'm gonna transfer an extra
30K into our joint account

21:26.870 --> 21:28.500
right now.

21:30.040 --> 21:31.540
You're all ready to get started.

21:31.541 --> 21:31.961
The money's all yours.

21:31.962 --> 21:33.538
So try it,

21:35.295 --> 21:37.515
because I need you
to get over this.

21:40.091 --> 21:42.511
Sarah, honey, it's been months.

22:07.244 --> 22:08.124
We good?

22:15.877 --> 22:17.037
Sam.

22:17.045 --> 22:19.345
Great, thanks.

22:24.010 --> 22:24.550
Hors d'oeuvres?

22:29.808 --> 22:31.225
It's a win-win.

22:31.226 --> 22:32.766
You put the shopping center
in the tourism district.

22:32.769 --> 22:33.978
You make money.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.059
The state doesn't have
to front any capital,

22:35.063 --> 22:37.403
and they're very committed
to some deep tax cuts.

22:37.404 --> 22:39.189
So, it's low risk.

22:39.192 --> 22:41.321
It's good for you,
it's good for them,

22:41.322 --> 22:42.778
it's a public/private
partnership.

22:42.779 --> 22:45.279
Charlie has my full confidence
to handle all the details.

22:45.282 --> 22:46.032
Great.

22:46.033 --> 22:47.408
And you know what?

22:47.409 --> 22:48.989
It's good for the
economy, it creates jobs.

22:48.994 --> 22:49.994
Yeah, but could
you imagine working

22:49.995 --> 22:52.045
for minimum wage at
one of those chains?

22:52.046 --> 22:55.618
Well, a job is
better than no job.

22:55.625 --> 22:58.377
Yeah, but I mean, if someone's
own business went under

22:58.378 --> 22:59.587
after the storm, and they're
making half of what they

22:59.588 --> 23:03.548
used to at a fast food
place, is that recovery?

23:03.550 --> 23:06.468
I mean, I'm glad
you're doing the deal.

23:06.469 --> 23:07.179
Right.

23:07.180 --> 23:08.468
I'm happy for you.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.721
I'm just saying, what is it
really gonna take to recover?

23:10.724 --> 23:11.854
That's a very interesting point.

23:11.855 --> 23:13.350
I've been reading about this.

23:13.351 --> 23:14.731
I'm sorry, I have to
interrupt you there, because

23:14.732 --> 23:18.268
the thing is those jobs just
aren't out there anymore.

23:18.273 --> 23:22.776
I mean my hand to God I wish
they were, but they're not.

23:22.777 --> 23:23.527
So.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.108
But you know what you should do?

23:25.113 --> 23:26.073
You should open a dress shop,

23:26.074 --> 23:28.372
and you should pay
people whatever you want.

23:28.373 --> 23:30.696
You're opening a dress shop?

23:30.702 --> 23:31.582
Um, maybe.

23:32.746 --> 23:33.786
You design dresses,
did you make that?

23:33.788 --> 23:35.956
I did,

23:35.957 --> 23:38.207
um, I went to school
for clothing design.

23:38.209 --> 23:39.209
I have a little workshop.

23:39.210 --> 23:40.790
It's very well made, and

23:40.795 --> 23:42.551
I kinda know what
I'm talking about.

23:42.552 --> 23:43.667
You make dresses?

23:43.673 --> 23:45.090
No.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.091
No, I used to work
in a textile factory.

23:47.093 --> 23:47.891
Really?

23:47.892 --> 23:48.376
Yeah.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.053
When?

23:50.055 --> 23:51.315
You know, honey,
I'm sure Mister Blake

23:51.316 --> 23:53.515
doesn't want to talk
about ancient history.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.426
Anyone care for
some beef tartare?

23:55.435 --> 23:56.395
Sam, right?

23:56.396 --> 23:57.561
Yeah.

23:57.562 --> 23:59.062
You're just the guy
I want to talk to.

23:59.064 --> 24:00.814
Sam, you own a local business,
you own a restaurant.

24:00.815 --> 24:02.024
Oh, well, my dad owns it.

24:02.025 --> 24:03.033
Oh, you're dad owns
a restaurant, okay.

24:03.034 --> 24:04.276
But you make more there than you

24:04.277 --> 24:05.527
would at the big
chain restaurants.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.695
Roger.

24:06.696 --> 24:07.986
But did you know the
big chain restaurants,

24:07.989 --> 24:09.569
they offer health coverage.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.372
I mean, do you guys
offer that to your staff?

24:11.373 --> 24:11.988
No.

24:11.993 --> 24:12.993
No.

24:12.994 --> 24:14.828
Roger.

24:14.829 --> 24:15.289
Are you guys hiring right now?

24:15.290 --> 24:16.538
No, we aren't.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.169
That's a shame, I guess
I'm gonna have to uh,

24:18.170 --> 24:20.786
table the ol' application.

24:20.794 --> 24:22.344
Sounds to me like the good jobs

24:22.345 --> 24:24.957
out there are
kinda hard to find.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.305
Yeah, they are.

24:31.306 --> 24:34.354
Better get back to work.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.439
Sam!

24:42.440 --> 24:43.270
Sam!

24:46.611 --> 24:47.945
I'm so sorry.

24:47.946 --> 24:48.986
It's fine, don't worry about it.

24:48.989 --> 24:50.069
That wasn't about you at all.

24:50.073 --> 24:52.282
That was totally our baggage.

24:52.283 --> 24:53.373
He was a total dick.

24:53.374 --> 24:55.288
I wouldn't say that.

24:56.287 --> 24:58.997
You don't have to bullshit me.

24:58.999 --> 25:01.208
Please, if I hear anymore
bullshit I could scream.

25:01.209 --> 25:03.459
Are you taking a break?

25:03.461 --> 25:05.421
Yeah, I got a little
while before dessert.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.632
I just needed some fresh air.

25:08.633 --> 25:10.342
Fuck fresh air.

25:10.343 --> 25:11.843
How 'bout a drink?

25:14.305 --> 25:16.265
You brought the tuna,
I brought the bourbon.

25:16.266 --> 25:16.846
Is that right?

25:16.850 --> 25:17.810
You're a chef.

25:17.811 --> 25:20.139
Every good meal deserves
a good drink, right?

25:20.145 --> 25:22.479
That's a good point.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.189
I take a walk out
here every night.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.770
It's so quiet.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.818
I mean, just look out there.

25:27.819 --> 25:28.779
I don't know.

25:29.279 --> 25:31.239
I love it here.

25:33.575 --> 25:36.454
I don't know, it's
kind of dark and cold.

25:36.455 --> 25:37.953
Wouldn't you rather be inside?

25:37.954 --> 25:38.834
No.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.000
When Roger and I
were first together,

25:43.001 --> 25:44.877
he could be very charming.

25:44.878 --> 25:45.668
Cute, even.

25:46.963 --> 25:48.713
Things weren't always like this.

25:48.715 --> 25:52.176
We actually had a couple
of really good years.

25:52.177 --> 25:56.387
But now, at the end of
the day I think, tonight.

25:56.389 --> 26:00.679
Tonight he's gonna come
home and we won't fight.

26:00.685 --> 26:01.565
But we do.

26:04.105 --> 26:06.315
Alright, your turn.

26:06.316 --> 26:07.726
Thanks, but uh,

26:08.943 --> 26:12.529
I should probably head
back to the kitchen.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.530
Uh-huh, no, no.

26:14.532 --> 26:16.782
I just told you my life story.

26:16.785 --> 26:17.745
Now it's your turn.

26:17.746 --> 26:19.703
I have pastries to warm.

26:19.704 --> 26:20.334
I'm the one who hired you.

26:20.335 --> 26:23.830
The pastries can wait.

26:23.833 --> 26:24.373
Come on.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.675
How was your year?

26:27.879 --> 26:30.297
Don't be a pussy.
Ow.

26:30.298 --> 26:31.878
Come on, we said no bullshit.

26:31.883 --> 26:34.133
Uh, you said no bullshit.

26:37.430 --> 26:37.930
My year, I...

26:39.724 --> 26:40.933
My year was crappy.

26:40.934 --> 26:41.434
Hmph.

26:43.728 --> 26:45.148
That was funny?

26:47.273 --> 26:48.153
Um,

26:48.691 --> 26:49.691
why was it crappy?

26:53.738 --> 26:57.908
I spent the last six years
working my way up in New York.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.535
It was crappy hours.

26:59.536 --> 27:02.696
I lost touch with most
of my friends, so,

27:09.546 --> 27:12.376
was workin' on
opening my own place.

27:18.138 --> 27:20.218
It was a mess,

27:22.642 --> 27:25.852
and probably the
best time of my life.

27:27.313 --> 27:30.113
Spent every dime I had.

27:31.442 --> 27:34.069
I was behind on rent.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.740
I owed everyone money.

27:36.406 --> 27:38.866
I was just hustling.

27:41.369 --> 27:43.619
Running around town,
catering, making a buck

27:43.621 --> 27:45.791
any way I could just
to keep it going.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.804
But every day I cooked
whatever I wanted.

27:55.049 --> 27:55.879
It was good.

27:57.802 --> 27:58.252
I just knew.

28:00.847 --> 28:04.637
I knew it was the best
stuff I could make.

28:04.642 --> 28:05.642
I loved it.

28:08.146 --> 28:10.016
I took the time.

28:10.023 --> 28:11.193
I did it right.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.650
I made each dish perfect.

28:19.490 --> 28:22.080
I had a soft opening,

28:22.660 --> 28:23.950
a few good reviews.

28:26.456 --> 28:29.116
I was in over my head.

28:30.835 --> 28:31.545
It turns out people
don't let you

28:31.546 --> 28:33.884
stay when you don't pay 'em.

28:38.301 --> 28:40.551
Rent was 10 grand a month.

28:44.807 --> 28:48.597
So, now I'm working
for my dad again,

28:48.603 --> 28:50.853
like when I was a teenager.

28:53.650 --> 28:55.360
Then the storm came.

28:56.986 --> 29:00.316
I watched half the
place get destroyed.

29:00.323 --> 29:02.407
That's not your fault.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.528
I mean that happened
to everybody.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.537
My dad would disagree.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.868
I mean we put out some sandbags,

29:09.874 --> 29:11.294
but I could have prepped better.

29:11.295 --> 29:14.042
I was inside drinking
with my friends,

29:14.045 --> 29:16.630
sure nothing would happen.

29:16.631 --> 29:17.511
Anyway.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.219
It's been a crappy year, yes.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.640
Most of this year I
wish I could forget.

29:28.226 --> 29:29.516
Alright, well,

29:31.062 --> 29:35.941
then let's make your night
something to remember.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.320
What are you doin'?

29:37.321 --> 29:40.398
I have recently been reminded
that life is very short,

29:40.405 --> 29:41.915
so, I'm living it.

29:44.659 --> 29:45.529
You?

29:48.496 --> 29:50.496
Are you coming with me, or what?

29:50.498 --> 29:51.868
I'm thinking it over!

29:51.874 --> 29:53.291
Come on, it's no big deal!

29:53.292 --> 29:54.382
The water's warm, I
do this all the time!

29:54.383 --> 29:56.795
You're crazy!

29:58.339 --> 29:59.756
And kinda hot.

29:59.757 --> 30:00.667
What?

30:00.675 --> 30:02.300
I said you're crazy!

30:02.301 --> 30:04.261
You're crazy!

30:04.262 --> 30:05.390
You've lived here
your whole life

30:05.391 --> 30:06.428
and you've never done this?

30:06.431 --> 30:07.806
No!

30:07.807 --> 30:08.387
Because it's freakin'
dangerous at night.

30:08.391 --> 30:10.021
Ugh.

30:20.278 --> 30:21.148
Sarah?

30:22.280 --> 30:23.910
Sarah!

30:27.285 --> 30:28.165
Sarah?

30:30.413 --> 30:31.293
Shit.

30:53.811 --> 30:54.391
Hey.

30:54.395 --> 30:56.025
You okay?

31:01.069 --> 31:03.739
I told you it wasn't so bad.

31:06.616 --> 31:10.576
I think we might
have missed dessert.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.408
You are soaked.

31:12.413 --> 31:14.753
Yeah, look who's talkin'.

31:25.510 --> 31:27.050
Listen, you handle the
negotiations on this deal,

31:27.053 --> 31:30.722
and uh, you can have
direct commission, 15%.

31:30.723 --> 31:31.683
Hey, I asked you a question!

31:31.684 --> 31:33.642
What are you doing
out here with my wife?

31:33.643 --> 31:35.852
Roger, stop.

31:35.853 --> 31:37.020
Hey, hey.

31:37.021 --> 31:40.565
Hold on for a second,
hold on, hold on.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.816
I get to ask you that question.

31:41.818 --> 31:42.818
I don't know what you saw.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.359
Roger, calm down.

31:44.362 --> 31:45.990
Roger please, just calm down.
You think it was nothing?!

31:45.991 --> 31:46.778
Roger, take a minute.
You think it was nothing?!

31:46.781 --> 31:48.741
You want me to calm down?!

31:49.951 --> 31:51.451
- Ah!
- Hey!

31:52.912 --> 31:54.079
Roger!

31:54.080 --> 31:55.660
- Ugh.
- Roger!

31:55.665 --> 31:56.998
Roger, stop!

31:56.999 --> 31:58.708
Roger, stop!

31:58.709 --> 31:59.959
Hey, what the
hell are you doing?

31:59.961 --> 32:01.169
She knows!

32:01.170 --> 32:02.796
He knows, she knows!

32:02.797 --> 32:06.507
You alright man?

32:06.509 --> 32:08.677
You okay?

32:08.678 --> 32:09.428
I'm fine.

32:09.429 --> 32:11.805
Oh.

32:11.806 --> 32:12.636
Wait, I'm coming with you.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.680
Sarah, Sarah.

32:14.684 --> 32:15.934
You going with him?

32:15.935 --> 32:17.102
I'm going with them.

32:17.103 --> 32:18.193
Not after what happened.

32:18.194 --> 32:19.396
Nothing happened.

32:19.397 --> 32:20.647
That is not what it looked like.

32:20.648 --> 32:23.148
Just calm down, I'll
be back in a few hours.

32:23.151 --> 32:23.601
Sarah!

32:24.777 --> 32:26.736
You stay here.

32:26.737 --> 32:27.187
You stay home.

32:31.951 --> 32:33.118
Charlie.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.499
Stay here make sure
everything's cool.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.786
Drive.

32:37.790 --> 32:39.416
Please.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.675
Gonna be a few more hours.

32:52.180 --> 32:53.680
Ugh, God-dammit.

32:57.226 --> 32:57.676
Sorry.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.650
I was here a lot last year.

33:02.481 --> 33:04.021
My mom was sick.

33:08.362 --> 33:08.902
Let me.

33:11.824 --> 33:14.624
What was she here for?

33:16.913 --> 33:17.373
Lung cancer.

33:22.293 --> 33:25.593
She left me a message
the day she died.

33:28.299 --> 33:30.759
I didn't even call her back.

33:34.305 --> 33:35.145
Let's take a walk.

33:36.307 --> 33:38.637
Sarah, it's Mom.

33:38.643 --> 33:41.895
Are you coming by today?

33:41.896 --> 33:44.306
They say tomorrow
might be another scan.

33:46.484 --> 33:50.404
I couldn't eat breakfast
really, I just feel, it's worse.

33:52.531 --> 33:54.451
Well, I hope to see you.

33:55.493 --> 33:56.826
I love you.

33:56.827 --> 34:01.367
Huh, sorry, but it's
just, it's hard to hear.

34:01.374 --> 34:04.000
She was beautiful
when I was a kid.

34:04.001 --> 34:05.291
Every detail was perfect.

34:07.421 --> 34:09.880
The way she wore her clothes,

34:09.882 --> 34:11.132
the smell of her perfume.

34:13.177 --> 34:17.507
I wanted to open a
store for years, but,

34:17.514 --> 34:21.775
even if I did, it's not like
she'd be there to see it.

34:22.853 --> 34:25.230
What about your dad?

34:25.231 --> 34:27.360
He died a few years ago.

34:30.987 --> 34:34.277
I heard you were married once?

34:35.324 --> 34:37.284
But she died too?

34:37.284 --> 34:37.745
Yeah.

34:45.208 --> 34:45.659
I'm sorry.

34:59.849 --> 35:01.725
She's not good.

35:01.726 --> 35:03.016
But, you know, it's hard to know

35:03.019 --> 35:06.729
'cause she's such
a hypochondriac.

35:07.148 --> 35:08.058
Oh, my God.

35:08.065 --> 35:09.321
I'm fine, Mom, don't worry.

35:09.322 --> 35:11.735
Don't worry, you look terrible.

35:11.736 --> 35:12.566
What happened to you?

35:12.570 --> 35:13.320
Got in a fight.

35:13.321 --> 35:14.651
A fight?

35:14.655 --> 35:15.913
- So what's this?
- Have you seen a doctor?

35:15.914 --> 35:16.866
Jesus Christ, are you alright?

35:16.866 --> 35:17.866
Yeah Mom, that's where
I got the stitches.

35:17.867 --> 35:19.075
This is you working hard?

35:19.076 --> 35:20.285
I was working
hard, I had a gig...

35:20.286 --> 35:21.576
Partying all hours of the night,

35:21.579 --> 35:22.287
and then a fight?
Would you stop it!

35:22.288 --> 35:22.908
- Dad!
- What?

35:22.913 --> 35:23.753
What is this?

35:23.754 --> 35:24.828
What's what?

35:24.832 --> 35:25.872
It's a collection notice.

35:25.875 --> 35:26.833
It's not my fault if
you're out there buying...

35:26.834 --> 35:27.334
For you.

35:30.671 --> 35:32.589
What was I supposed to do?

35:32.590 --> 35:33.880
Close up for six months while

35:33.883 --> 35:35.342
I wait for the insurance money?

35:35.343 --> 35:36.553
We would have been finished.

35:36.554 --> 35:38.222
The insurance
came after a month.

35:40.598 --> 35:41.308
It came after six.

35:43.768 --> 35:46.518
After the recession hit
we started losing money.

35:46.520 --> 35:50.270
I thought things would turn
around in a year or so, but

35:50.274 --> 35:50.734
they didn't.

35:54.070 --> 35:57.110
And then that damn storm hit.

35:57.114 --> 35:59.074
I had to take out a loan.

35:59.075 --> 36:01.034
Put the business
up for collateral.

36:01.035 --> 36:02.795
I knew you wouldn't let me,

36:02.796 --> 36:07.037
so I told you the money came
from the insurance company.

36:07.041 --> 36:09.081
When the insurance check came,

36:09.085 --> 36:11.635
it covered only half the cost.

36:15.007 --> 36:18.257
I didn't want either of
you to know how bad it was.

36:23.891 --> 36:25.058
It's gonna be okay.

36:25.059 --> 36:27.099
You're gonna have to lay
off some of the part-timers,

36:27.103 --> 36:30.605
the rest get a 10% cut,
and no more overtime.

36:30.606 --> 36:32.726
10%?

36:32.733 --> 36:36.319
If we can re-finance,
make some sacrifices,

36:36.320 --> 36:37.450
we can get through this.

36:51.001 --> 36:52.001
I'm sorry, but the request

36:52.002 --> 36:53.752
for a loan modification
has been denied.

36:53.754 --> 36:55.588
What?

36:55.589 --> 36:56.758
We can make the payments.

36:56.759 --> 36:58.837
The loan is more
than 90 days past due.

36:58.843 --> 37:00.681
We have the right to
collect immediately.

37:00.682 --> 37:03.298
What does that mean,
"collect immediately"?

37:03.305 --> 37:06.516
The business was
put up as collateral,

37:06.517 --> 37:09.807
so we will assume
ownership and liquidate it.

37:09.812 --> 37:10.979
That's outrageous.

37:10.980 --> 37:12.020
It was in the
contract you signed.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.522
You will make less money than

37:13.524 --> 37:14.484
if you just let us
make the payments!

37:14.485 --> 37:17.026
I'm sorry, that is
the bank's decision.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.277
Well then I want
to talk to a manager.

37:18.279 --> 37:21.529
He'll tell you the same
thing, the decision is final.

37:25.786 --> 37:28.156
You better believe the
Better Business Bureau

37:28.164 --> 37:30.424
is gonna hear about this,
and our congressman.

37:30.425 --> 37:32.826
This is unheard of behavior.

37:32.835 --> 37:35.170
And you should be
ashamed of yourself.

37:35.171 --> 37:36.461
It's no wonder the
small businesses

37:36.464 --> 37:39.299
in this town are
packing up and leaving.

37:39.300 --> 37:42.510
I have shown you the numbers,
we are a viable business!

37:42.511 --> 37:46.511
This is the kind of place
this community needs.

38:02.031 --> 38:02.741
Dad said he'd
mortgage the house,

38:02.742 --> 38:04.570
Roger doesn't want the money.

38:04.575 --> 38:08.286
I mean this is gonna kill
my dad, maybe literally.

38:08.287 --> 38:11.077
We tried to get into Roger's
office, he wouldn't talk to us.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.749
Will you talk to him?

38:12.750 --> 38:14.330
And say what exactly?

38:14.335 --> 38:15.635
I don't know, but
he'll take your call,

38:15.636 --> 38:17.208
'cause he does
business with you.

38:17.213 --> 38:21.223
Sam, I want to help, but I
don't know what I could say.

38:22.426 --> 38:25.296
Maybe if you told him that
unless he modifies our loan,

38:25.304 --> 38:27.430
you won't go through
with the deal.

38:27.431 --> 38:28.141
Sam.

38:28.142 --> 38:30.350
We signed a contract.

38:30.351 --> 38:33.101
To be honest this hasn't
been a very good year,

38:33.103 --> 38:34.773
I kind of need to
make this deal.

38:34.774 --> 38:36.940
What happens if you don't do it?

38:36.941 --> 38:38.441
You lose business,
you lose your house?

38:38.442 --> 38:41.652
You said you, you
rebuilt after the storm,

38:41.654 --> 38:44.072
and you, you wrote a check.

38:44.073 --> 38:45.623
My family lost
everything we had.

38:45.624 --> 38:47.236
Yeah, I wrote a check.

38:47.243 --> 38:49.702
And you know how
I could afford to?

38:49.703 --> 38:50.953
By not writing the wrong ones.

38:50.955 --> 38:53.293
I'm not running a charity,
and I got a lot of money tied

38:53.294 --> 38:56.629
up in this deal, and you're
asking me to dump it for what?

38:56.630 --> 38:58.917
To help a restaurant
that's already gone under?

38:58.921 --> 39:00.801
To help a guy who
took a catering job,

39:00.802 --> 39:04.128
and wound up in a
fist-fight with his client?

39:04.134 --> 39:06.344
Look, I'm sorry if
this sounds harsh,

39:06.345 --> 39:07.685
but I'm a business man
and this is business.

39:07.686 --> 39:12.730
I know, I'm asking a lot,
and I'm sorry, but I have to.

39:14.103 --> 39:16.943
'Cause this is
everything for my family.

39:18.607 --> 39:19.057
Please.

39:26.574 --> 39:27.744
I'm sorry, son.

39:28.909 --> 39:32.039
You're asking for
something I can't do.

39:36.792 --> 39:37.672
Okay.

40:12.286 --> 40:13.156
Here.

40:22.212 --> 40:23.842
This what you
were saving it for?

40:23.843 --> 40:28.089
I was saving it for my
retirement, so maybe.

40:31.639 --> 40:35.058
I haven't lived a
day without that

40:35.059 --> 40:36.559
building being in our family.

40:40.731 --> 40:42.611
When I was growing up
your granddad fixed

40:42.612 --> 40:48.237
it my head that this was
the land of opportunity.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.568
This city is full of
people who think they're

40:49.573 --> 40:53.453
gonna hit it big one
day, how many of them do?

40:54.495 --> 40:57.295
Those things get
bigger and bigger.

40:58.415 --> 40:59.625
The rest of us?

41:07.675 --> 41:09.385
Here's to the house!

41:18.352 --> 41:19.232
Hello?

41:21.981 --> 41:22.731
How could you do that?

41:22.732 --> 41:24.771
It was a business decision.

41:24.775 --> 41:27.281
That was not a business
decision, and you know it.

41:27.282 --> 41:30.196
You're ruining these
people's lives over a look.

41:30.197 --> 41:32.367
You haven't looked at me
like that in such a long time.

41:32.368 --> 41:34.276
Roger, nothing happened.

41:34.284 --> 41:35.622
I didn't do anything.

41:35.623 --> 41:36.788
I don't want to hurt you.

41:36.789 --> 41:38.246
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

41:38.247 --> 41:39.457
You didn't do anything
'cause you don't want to,

41:39.458 --> 41:42.206
or you didn't do anything
'cause you're not allowed to?

41:42.209 --> 41:42.959
Which is it, Sarah?

41:42.960 --> 41:45.128
Roger.

41:45.129 --> 41:46.749
Come on you wanted
it to, just admit it.

41:46.755 --> 41:48.798
Roger, I want us!

41:48.799 --> 41:51.089
I want us to feel right.

41:51.093 --> 41:52.303
But we don't.

41:55.055 --> 41:57.640
Are you happy,
with me, right now?

41:57.641 --> 41:59.225
Yeah, yeah, of course I am.

41:59.226 --> 41:59.726
Truly?

42:02.187 --> 42:03.057
Yeah.

42:04.064 --> 42:05.694
Huh.

42:10.029 --> 42:12.155
Because I'm not.

42:12.156 --> 42:13.486
I'm not happy.

42:14.658 --> 42:16.698
And I don't think that
you are either, because

42:16.702 --> 42:19.542
you couldn't be, and do
what you did to that family.

42:19.543 --> 42:22.998
I made my own decision,
I don't regret it.

42:23.000 --> 42:24.250
And if you can't do that, then

42:24.251 --> 42:26.881
you need to figure
your shit out.

42:28.797 --> 42:32.507
I think we need to
spend some time apart.

42:34.511 --> 42:35.341
Sarah?

42:36.096 --> 42:38.176
I think we should separate.

42:38.182 --> 42:39.892
Officially.

42:41.351 --> 42:42.351
Just sit.

42:42.352 --> 42:44.270
Hold on, hang on, you
don't want to do this.

42:44.271 --> 42:45.151
I do.

42:46.273 --> 42:47.653
I'm sorry but I really do.

43:03.123 --> 43:04.373
What are you doing here?

43:04.374 --> 43:06.714
Tom told me what happened.

43:09.880 --> 43:10.800
I'm so sorry.

43:13.050 --> 43:16.220
That is not your fault at all.

43:20.057 --> 43:21.017
Want a drink?

43:21.517 --> 43:23.387
Understatement.

43:43.288 --> 43:44.788
I always had a plan.

43:44.790 --> 43:49.040
Everyday I woke thinking
of my restaurant.

43:49.044 --> 43:52.344
Thinking of the next
step to get there.

43:53.715 --> 43:54.595
And now,

43:57.678 --> 43:58.548
nothin'.

44:03.600 --> 44:05.730
I saw that in my dad, too.

44:07.437 --> 44:11.017
Everyday of his life
he had that restaurant.

44:12.609 --> 44:15.739
And today, part of
him was just gone.

44:21.326 --> 44:23.406
And I used to think
more than anything

44:23.412 --> 44:24.952
that I was different than him.

44:27.499 --> 44:27.959
We're the same.

44:31.295 --> 44:31.925
Exactly the same.

45:01.408 --> 45:02.448
Shit, what'd I miss?

45:02.451 --> 45:04.410
I was thinking,

45:04.411 --> 45:06.871
about you, your dad.

45:09.583 --> 45:12.418
Maybe your old place is gone,

45:12.419 --> 45:15.379
but what if you
opened up a new one?

45:15.881 --> 45:18.257
It takes a lot.

45:18.258 --> 45:18.708
It takes...

45:18.715 --> 45:20.301
Money?

45:20.302 --> 45:21.886
Yeah.

45:21.887 --> 45:24.217
Can this get you started?

45:29.811 --> 45:30.311
I can't take that.

45:30.312 --> 45:31.942
You can.

45:33.315 --> 45:35.735
You can use it to start over.

45:39.446 --> 45:44.026
Sarah, that's really
generous, but I can't take it.

45:44.034 --> 45:48.412
You had more than that
taken away from you.

45:48.413 --> 45:48.833
Please take it.

45:51.375 --> 45:53.459
I kind of need you to take it.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.710
What about Roger?

45:55.712 --> 45:57.002
It's my money.

45:59.716 --> 46:02.546
But it's from our joint account,

46:02.552 --> 46:05.302
so you might want
to cash it soon.

46:05.722 --> 46:07.142
Like, today.

46:11.144 --> 46:15.064
I feel like a teenager, sneaking
out of your parents' house.

46:15.065 --> 46:15.565
Sorry.

46:16.692 --> 46:20.402
Don't be, it's kind of awesome.

46:27.577 --> 46:29.497
- Hey.
- Hmm?

46:32.916 --> 46:33.366
Thank you.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.310
Ah!

46:52.311 --> 46:53.436
Who was that?

46:53.437 --> 46:54.597
Why is there
always someone there?

46:54.604 --> 46:56.605
You brought a girl here.

46:56.606 --> 46:58.266
No, it's not like that.

46:58.275 --> 47:00.568
Oh, you're lucky your
mom's not here to see that.

47:00.569 --> 47:01.777
Where'd she go so early?

47:01.778 --> 47:02.398
Work.

47:02.404 --> 47:04.280
What?

47:04.281 --> 47:05.321
She took a job as a bookkeeper.

47:05.324 --> 47:06.824
That was fast.

47:06.825 --> 47:10.375
Came as a surprise, but
she has friends there.

47:12.456 --> 47:13.326
So,

47:15.625 --> 47:18.215
what's it like with this girl?

47:21.548 --> 47:24.508
I want to talk
to you about that.

47:28.472 --> 47:29.310
Thanks.

47:29.311 --> 47:30.636
Take all the time you need.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.809
It's not by the water.

47:33.810 --> 47:36.270
No, no it's not by the water.

47:36.271 --> 47:38.811
Which means less storm damage.

47:39.691 --> 47:41.361
It's also the reason
Josh is willing

47:41.362 --> 47:42.900
to rent it to us for so little.

47:42.903 --> 47:44.653
If he couldn't make it here,
what makes you think you can?

47:44.654 --> 47:46.280
I think he was
going for Asian Fusion

47:46.281 --> 47:47.871
in a neighborhood that's
about seafood, comfort food.

47:47.872 --> 47:50.866
They gave it a year,
it didn't work out.

47:50.869 --> 47:52.999
Happens to the best of us.

47:57.501 --> 48:00.336
I like the bar.

48:00.337 --> 48:01.497
Would this be your
place or mine?

48:01.505 --> 48:03.965
It could be ours.

48:06.510 --> 48:08.219
Yeah, hotel's good?

48:08.220 --> 48:09.510
It's alright.

48:09.513 --> 48:11.183
I set up a few things.

48:12.432 --> 48:13.972
It's weird not
having you in the house.

48:13.975 --> 48:15.022
I know, I'm sorry,

48:15.023 --> 48:17.808
but this is what we
need to do right now.

48:17.813 --> 48:18.979
How long?

48:18.980 --> 48:20.689
I don't know, maybe for a while.

48:20.690 --> 48:21.980
We're not working, Roger.

48:21.983 --> 48:24.985
How do you know,
you're not even here.

48:24.986 --> 48:27.696
Listen, please, I just
need some time and space.

48:27.697 --> 48:29.115
Okay, for now, we're separated.

48:29.116 --> 48:30.116
Yeah, but Sarah, if we just talk

48:30.117 --> 48:31.617
about it it's gonna be fine.

48:31.618 --> 48:33.868
So I need you to stop this
stupid shit, just come back.

48:33.870 --> 48:37.080
I don't know if I want to.

48:40.961 --> 48:44.211
Look, I know you're scared,
but this place is smaller.

48:44.214 --> 48:46.924
Business is picking
back up all over town.

48:46.925 --> 48:48.975
Everything is being
repaired from the storm.

48:48.976 --> 48:51.719
And what about the next storm?

48:51.721 --> 48:54.557
We don't have enough to retire.

48:54.558 --> 48:56.518
Not with what we've lost.

48:58.437 --> 49:00.597
What if we lose this house?

49:02.774 --> 49:06.944
If you would take a regular
job, just for a few years,

49:06.945 --> 49:11.073
we could save money, we
could plan our retirement.

49:11.074 --> 49:12.784
Why risk everything?

49:14.661 --> 49:18.330
Because running a
restaurant is what I do.

49:18.331 --> 49:21.041
It's what I've always done.

49:21.042 --> 49:22.172
Without that, what am I?

49:24.671 --> 49:27.131
You're my husband.

49:29.676 --> 49:33.926
You had that restaurant 30
years, and it was beautiful.

49:37.726 --> 49:39.806
But it's over.

50:40.497 --> 50:43.957
Not many people call me
before eight A. M. And live.

50:43.959 --> 50:45.539
Everything you needed.

50:45.544 --> 50:46.504
Can I get in today?

50:46.505 --> 50:49.003
You're an eager motherfucker.

Wow.

52:51.383 --> 52:53.918
We're pretty much there.

52:53.922 --> 52:55.589
Sam, it's amazing.

52:55.590 --> 52:56.715
Thank you.

52:56.716 --> 52:57.166
Have you ever met Josh?

52:57.175 --> 52:58.467
No.

52:58.468 --> 52:59.428
He's my best friend.

Again, for the record
that was amazing.

53:41.553 --> 53:42.433
I had a great time.

53:44.556 --> 53:45.426
Maybe you should come up?

53:45.432 --> 53:47.732
I can show you the
clothing designs.

53:47.733 --> 53:48.926
Yeah, sure.

53:53.565 --> 53:55.023
Oh, you have,

53:55.024 --> 53:57.324
I think you have got some
spinach stuck in your teeth.

53:57.325 --> 53:58.358
Oh, my gosh.

54:00.905 --> 54:01.823
I get it?
No.

54:01.824 --> 54:02.703
No?

54:04.492 --> 54:04.950
Now?

54:04.951 --> 54:05.871
Not at all.

54:05.872 --> 54:07.745
Oh, my god.

54:07.746 --> 54:09.866
Here.

54:09.873 --> 54:10.831
Whoa, what, what are you doing?

54:10.832 --> 54:11.542
It's okay, I'm a professional.

54:11.543 --> 54:14.541
I've dealt with this before.

54:14.544 --> 54:15.794
Let me just show
you where it is.

54:15.795 --> 54:16.255
Oh, god.

54:16.256 --> 54:18.088
Right there.

54:18.089 --> 54:18.839
Here?

54:18.840 --> 54:19.670
To the right.

54:19.674 --> 54:21.175
One more.

54:21.176 --> 54:22.466
Did I get it?

54:25.054 --> 54:26.722
Good to go.

54:26.723 --> 54:29.099
Great.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.190
So, should I come up?

54:31.978 --> 54:34.728
I don't know.

54:34.731 --> 54:36.231
Why not?

54:36.232 --> 54:39.692
Because if you come
up, I might kiss you.

54:41.404 --> 54:43.363
Well, maybe you should
just kiss me here.

54:43.364 --> 54:45.784
Then you don't have to worry.

54:46.910 --> 54:48.740
You want to kiss me?

54:48.745 --> 54:49.745
After all that?

54:49.746 --> 54:51.366
Really?

54:57.086 --> 55:01.086
Look I know you got a lot
goin' on in your life right now,

55:01.090 --> 55:03.630
so I understand you need to...

55:26.449 --> 55:29.868
Okay, now I really
want you to come up.

55:29.869 --> 55:31.539
I'd love to come up.

55:33.248 --> 55:36.667
Ugh.

55:36.668 --> 55:37.538
Ah.

55:39.212 --> 55:41.632
See how you feel next time.

56:47.030 --> 56:48.030
So now you call me back.

56:48.031 --> 56:50.369
I just bounced a check,
a very important one.

56:50.370 --> 56:51.825
Well money can go very quickly.

56:51.826 --> 56:54.366
You have written any other
large checks recently, have you?

56:54.370 --> 56:55.537
That money wasn't for me.

56:55.538 --> 56:56.618
Yeah, I know who it was for.

56:56.623 --> 56:59.041
It was for his family.

56:59.042 --> 57:01.542
You didn't just hurt him,
you hurt all of them.

57:01.544 --> 57:02.544
You took away their livelihood.

57:02.545 --> 57:04.963
What are they gonna do with it?

57:04.964 --> 57:06.804
I gave them
the chance to start over.

57:06.805 --> 57:10.969
Okay, I didn't
do anything about the check

57:10.970 --> 57:14.306
for you, but you decided how
you wanted to spend that money.

57:14.307 --> 57:15.927
I took everything out
except for three grand.

57:15.933 --> 57:18.060
That's not enough for
me to open the shop.

57:18.061 --> 57:19.689
I thought you wanted
me to open the shop.

57:19.690 --> 57:20.807
I thought you'd be okay with it.

57:20.813 --> 57:21.273
Oh, I did before.

57:21.274 --> 57:23.522
You want time?

57:23.524 --> 57:25.074
I can give you 3,000 a month
to live on, that's fair.

57:25.075 --> 57:26.735
That's fair.

57:26.736 --> 57:27.486
But you and I both know I'm
the one that earns that money.

57:27.487 --> 57:28.397
You don't want to live with me,

57:28.404 --> 57:30.739
you don't get to
spend my money...

57:30.740 --> 57:32.410
We were married when you
earned that money, Roger.

57:32.411 --> 57:35.577
I planned every party,
shook every hand.

57:35.578 --> 57:37.578
You didn't want
me to have a job.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.249
You can't tell me I
didn't do my part.

57:39.250 --> 57:41.168
You know how hard I
work for that money.

57:41.169 --> 57:43.997
The checks come in my name, so
that's the way it's gonna be.

57:44.003 --> 57:45.671
Unless.

57:45.672 --> 57:47.089
Unless?

57:47.090 --> 57:51.260
Unless you want to stop
this and come back home.

57:52.136 --> 57:54.046
You know what?

57:54.055 --> 57:56.139
Keep the money.

57:56.140 --> 57:57.020
Sarah.

57:57.642 --> 57:59.559
I'll do it on my own.

57:59.560 --> 58:00.730
How, you hardly have
anything in your account.

58:00.731 --> 58:02.228
I'll get a job.

58:02.230 --> 58:05.940
Sarah, come on, you're
gonna work a regular job?

58:15.243 --> 58:16.623
Take it, it's
everything I have left.

58:16.624 --> 58:17.989
No.

58:17.995 --> 58:19.295
Come on, you can't
open the shop without it.

58:19.296 --> 58:21.707
You can't open the
restaurant without it.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.998
I'm not gonna watch
that place fall apart.

58:24.001 --> 58:24.881
Sarah,

58:25.962 --> 58:27.796
it's your money.

58:27.797 --> 58:29.627
It's not anymore.

58:29.632 --> 58:31.932
I don't want to do
this with his money.

58:31.933 --> 58:33.886
I should do it on my own.

58:36.139 --> 58:36.679
But I was close.

58:40.476 --> 58:41.806
I don't know how long it will

58:41.811 --> 58:44.771
take me to get here
again on my own.

58:48.568 --> 58:50.818
You're not on your own.

58:50.820 --> 58:53.660
You have people
who care about you.

58:55.116 --> 58:59.486
You may not know how you'll
get there, but you will.

58:59.495 --> 59:03.457
How can you have so
much confidence in me?

59:03.458 --> 59:05.078
You hardly know me.

59:06.085 --> 59:06.755
I know enough.

59:32.737 --> 59:34.946
I'm covered in plaster,
I should shower.

59:34.947 --> 59:36.527
I'm gross.

59:36.532 --> 59:37.072
Let me see.

59:41.537 --> 59:42.867
Nope, not gross.

59:48.377 --> 59:51.707
I don't want you to go tonight.

This way?

And a little to the right.

01:01:34.442 --> 01:01:36.109
Ah.

01:01:36.110 --> 01:01:36.940

01:01:36.944 --> 01:01:37.694
Hey?

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:39.404
Oh, my god!

01:01:39.405 --> 01:01:41.745
I got the job at that store!

01:01:43.534 --> 01:01:45.660
So, a job, huh?

01:01:45.661 --> 01:01:47.329
It's been a while.

01:01:47.330 --> 01:01:48.710
I was wondering if
you would take a look

01:01:48.711 --> 01:01:50.786
at my business plan
for that clothing shop?

01:01:50.791 --> 01:01:53.835
Of course, I'd be happy to.

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:55.996
I'm really happy you called me.

01:01:56.005 --> 01:01:59.549
Me, too.

01:02:15.024 --> 01:02:16.358
Looks amazing.

01:02:16.359 --> 01:02:17.319
There you go.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.526
We'll see.

01:02:18.527 --> 01:02:19.647
Okay.

01:02:19.654 --> 01:02:20.454
Taste it.

01:02:21.697 --> 01:02:23.027
Okay, do you want
me to be honest?

01:02:23.032 --> 01:02:23.912
You have to be honest.

01:02:23.913 --> 01:02:25.158
Okay.

01:02:25.159 --> 01:02:25.869
I gotta sell this.

01:02:30.081 --> 01:02:31.121
Yeah?

01:02:31.123 --> 01:02:31.961
It's really good.

01:02:31.962 --> 01:02:32.918
Alright.

01:02:32.919 --> 01:02:33.997
That's so good.

01:02:34.001 --> 01:02:34.491
Alright.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:42.425
Hey, everybody,
welcome to Light Up New Jersey.

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:45.716
One year ago today,
the lights went out,

01:02:45.721 --> 01:02:46.811
but we're still here.

01:02:46.812 --> 01:02:49.676
Now shine your
lights in the air,

01:02:49.684 --> 01:02:53.024
and show them we
survived Hurricane Sandy.

01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.270
Three, two, one!

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:42.652
Thanks everyone
for coming out here.

01:03:42.653 --> 01:03:44.532
I know we're anxious
to close the deal,

01:03:44.533 --> 01:03:46.450
but I think we're
done for the day.

01:03:46.451 --> 01:03:47.449
Excuse me?

01:03:47.450 --> 01:03:49.159
I want to look over
this in a little more

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:50.950
detail before we
purchase the real estate.

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:52.120
You signed a contract.

01:03:52.121 --> 01:03:53.501
Roger, we both that
the contract isn't fully

01:03:53.502 --> 01:03:55.117
executed until the
money's transferred.

01:03:55.124 --> 01:03:57.674
You already have the money.

01:04:13.642 --> 01:04:14.809
Hey.

01:04:14.810 --> 01:04:16.190
Can I get a beer?

01:04:21.317 --> 01:04:23.067
Thank you.

01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:24.569
It's five bucks.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.201
Keep the change.

01:04:33.621 --> 01:04:35.330
I had a bad day today.

01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:37.001
I had to fire Charlie.

01:04:38.334 --> 01:04:39.709
Shit.

01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:43.000
I'm starting to regret
having made this deal.

01:04:43.005 --> 01:04:45.715
I'm not sure what I'm getting
out of this investment.

01:04:45.716 --> 01:04:46.586
Anyway,

01:04:48.969 --> 01:04:50.049
I came to say I'm sorry.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:53.640
You came to me as a
friend, I let you down.

01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:56.811
I'm not really used
to having friends.

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.728
And I was wrong, this place
is comin' along great.

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:03.320
I don't know how
you're doing it.

01:05:03.321 --> 01:05:05.276
What, are you
catering again, or?

01:05:05.277 --> 01:05:06.567
Not this time.

01:05:08.114 --> 01:05:10.494
I think part of what
went wrong in New York

01:05:10.495 --> 01:05:13.076
is I always wanted more.

01:05:13.077 --> 01:05:15.077
I wanted everything
to be perfect.

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:20.129
I didn't pick my moment,
and it never happened.

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:27.548
But we have an investor, he
gave us enough to get it open.

01:05:27.550 --> 01:05:29.130
This is our moment.

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:31.261
We open in 10 days.

01:05:31.262 --> 01:05:32.472
I wanna help.

01:05:34.014 --> 01:05:36.144
What'd you have in mind?

01:05:38.227 --> 01:05:40.895
You know what I
do need help with?

01:05:40.896 --> 01:05:44.646
I need to paint this place.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:48.860
If you want to invest in
this, you could try that.

01:05:52.741 --> 01:05:55.451
Yeah, that's clean.

01:05:55.452 --> 01:05:56.872
You're jerkin' on my brown.

01:05:56.873 --> 01:05:58.451
I mean, now I want
to get it perfect.

01:05:58.455 --> 01:06:00.085
Oh, yeah.

01:06:01.584 --> 01:06:05.378
Sarah's texting me, she's
texting me, come on.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:18.766
Hi.

01:06:18.767 --> 01:06:20.476
Yeah, it's a seafood
restaurant, come check it out.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.307
New seafood restaurant
from the Rama family.

01:06:22.313 --> 01:06:23.813
Opening this Saturday.

01:06:23.814 --> 01:06:27.074
Hi, there, new
restaurant, please stop by.

01:06:29.945 --> 01:06:31.285
Hey, sir, new restaurant.

01:07:10.152 --> 01:07:11.861
If I told you right now
you'd never have to work

01:07:11.862 --> 01:07:12.822
another day in your life, you'd
jump at the chance, right?

01:07:12.823 --> 01:07:14.321
Yeah, of course.

01:07:14.323 --> 01:07:17.492
God damn, right, 'cause
that's the American dream,

01:07:17.493 --> 01:07:18.663
and I gave it to her.

01:07:18.664 --> 01:07:20.286
My wife?

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:23.667
She doesn't have to worry
about the bills, you know why?

01:07:23.668 --> 01:07:25.626
'Cause of me.

01:07:27.002 --> 01:07:29.002
Now my wife thinks
"You do what you love,

01:07:29.004 --> 01:07:30.838
"you do what you dream".

01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.757
People gotta make money.

01:07:32.758 --> 01:07:37.008
What's the matter
with that being your dream?

01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:44.851
Time to go home, man.

01:07:45.771 --> 01:07:47.191
I could use another drink.

01:07:51.193 --> 01:07:54.363
Ugh.

01:08:24.685 --> 01:08:25.854
What's up?

01:09:00.095 --> 01:09:03.354
Sorry my boss
wouldn't let me leave.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:14.439
I'm so sorry, Dad.

01:09:15.694 --> 01:09:19.781
I'm sorry I didn't do
more during the storm.

01:09:19.782 --> 01:09:21.948
I let your place get destroyed.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:24.618
It wasn't your fault, Sam.

01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:27.290
And, I made you
feel like it was.

01:09:28.457 --> 01:09:30.117
More sand bags?

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:32.752
Wouldn't have stopped
all that water.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:35.380
This isn't your fault, either.

01:09:35.381 --> 01:09:37.421
Somebody did this to you.

01:09:39.468 --> 01:09:40.298
Do you have idea who?

01:09:56.193 --> 01:09:59.362
You wrecked my son's restaurant.

01:09:59.363 --> 01:10:00.655
Good morning.

01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:01.316
Sorry, I have no
idea who you are.

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:04.117
You know my son, Sam.

01:10:04.118 --> 01:10:05.868
His restaurant was
vandalized last night.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.909
Yeah, I'm sorry, I have
no idea how that happened.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.455
I think you do.

01:10:09.456 --> 01:10:11.456
He's dating your
wife, who left you,

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:12.958
you're pissed, so you did this.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.836
You guys are dating?

01:10:14.837 --> 01:10:16.337
Don't change the subject.

01:10:16.338 --> 01:10:17.628
You know what sir, like
I said, I have no idea what

01:10:17.631 --> 01:10:19.171
you're talking about so I think
you should leave my house.

01:10:19.174 --> 01:10:21.052
Oh, we're not goin' anywhere
until you make this right.

01:10:21.053 --> 01:10:21.681
Excuse me?

01:10:21.682 --> 01:10:22.797
You heard what I said.

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:25.263
My son busted his ass
putting that place together.

01:10:25.264 --> 01:10:27.564
You have no right to come in
there and destroy our property.

01:10:27.565 --> 01:10:29.018
So you're gonna apologize,

01:10:29.019 --> 01:10:30.935
and you're gonna
pay for the damages.

01:10:30.936 --> 01:10:32.145
Until then, we are not leaving.

01:10:32.146 --> 01:10:33.726
It's your property, huh?

01:10:33.731 --> 01:10:35.361
It's your property,
did you pay for it?

01:10:35.362 --> 01:10:36.857
Sam, close the door.

01:10:36.859 --> 01:10:38.149
If you don't get out of my house

01:10:38.152 --> 01:10:40.652
right now, I'm gonna
call the police.

01:10:40.654 --> 01:10:41.574
Call 'em.

01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:43.072
Tell them what you did.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.823
The cops in this town
come from my neighborhood,

01:10:44.825 --> 01:10:45.535
not yours, son.

01:10:45.536 --> 01:10:47.493
I've been there almost 60 years.

01:10:47.494 --> 01:10:50.584
Don't think that I don't
know them and their fathers.

01:10:50.585 --> 01:10:51.661
Sam, the door.

01:10:53.167 --> 01:10:55.537
Now you think you can
get away with this.

01:10:55.544 --> 01:10:58.384
We're here to tell
you, you cannot.

01:11:01.008 --> 01:11:03.048
Get out of my house.

01:11:03.051 --> 01:11:03.801
No.

01:11:03.802 --> 01:11:04.971
I said get out of my house.

01:11:04.972 --> 01:11:06.179
That's not gonna happen!

01:11:06.180 --> 01:11:07.050
Dad!

01:11:08.974 --> 01:11:10.308
Don't you touch my dad again.

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:11.389
What's it gonna be,
you gonna work with us,

01:11:11.393 --> 01:11:12.393
you gonna make some
sort of arrangement?

01:11:12.394 --> 01:11:13.603
Or are we gonna call the cops?

01:11:13.604 --> 01:11:14.982
Call whoever you want,
it won't change shit.

01:11:14.983 --> 01:11:15.860
You think she's gonna
move in with you,

01:11:15.861 --> 01:11:17.396
she can move in
with your parents?

01:11:17.399 --> 01:11:19.439
You think that's
gonna make her happy?

01:11:19.443 --> 01:11:21.243
You're living in a
dream world, buddy.

01:11:21.244 --> 01:11:23.606
She is so out of your league.

01:11:23.614 --> 01:11:27.033
'Cause in the real world, in
the real world she chooses me.

01:11:27.034 --> 01:11:29.081
You just hope I leave
a big enough tip

01:11:29.082 --> 01:11:30.697
so you can pay your rent.

01:11:30.704 --> 01:11:31.584
Ah!

01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:38.252
Sam!

01:11:38.253 --> 01:11:39.423
Ugh!

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.020
Sam, Sam.

01:12:05.864 --> 01:12:07.990
Sarah.

01:12:07.991 --> 01:12:09.159
Oh, my god, Sam, what was that?

01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.279
He trashed my place,
he destroyed it.

01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:11.045
I know!

01:12:11.046 --> 01:12:12.406
I came here to...

01:12:13.956 --> 01:12:15.366
but what the fuck Sam?

01:12:15.374 --> 01:12:16.924
I know, I'm sorry, I lost it.

01:12:16.925 --> 01:12:21.167
I just, I just, I just lost
it, he said you would never...

01:12:23.131 --> 01:12:25.171
That is my fault what
just happened in there.

01:12:25.175 --> 01:12:28.225
I am hurting both of you.

01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:31.601
This isn't good for anybody.

01:12:32.099 --> 01:12:34.269
I need you to go.

01:12:35.477 --> 01:12:39.437
I need to not talk to
either of you for a while.

01:12:40.774 --> 01:12:42.149
How long?

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:42.610
I don't know.

01:12:47.114 --> 01:12:47.704
Hey.

01:12:47.705 --> 01:12:49.908
Sam, please, please.

01:13:09.636 --> 01:13:12.806
Disaster happens,
you can't stop it.

01:13:14.349 --> 01:13:16.019
The damage is done.

01:13:17.477 --> 01:13:18.687
So we've got two choices.

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:23.937
So, you tear it down,

01:13:27.029 --> 01:13:28.909
or you build it back up.

01:13:34.036 --> 01:13:36.696
Now I don't know
about the next time.

01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:39.005
Maybe there will be a
time that we give up,

01:13:39.006 --> 01:13:41.079
but I don't think it's today.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.674
I think you all want
to open tomorrow.

01:13:42.675 --> 01:13:44.045
Of course we do.

01:13:44.046 --> 01:13:46.005
We spent weeks getting
this place ready.

01:13:46.006 --> 01:13:46.546
We have 'til tomorrow night.

01:13:46.548 --> 01:13:48.338
Then we postpone.

01:13:48.342 --> 01:13:49.382
Give it two weeks.

01:13:49.384 --> 01:13:50.722
We just handed out thousands

01:13:50.723 --> 01:13:52.598
of fliers announcing
tomorrow night.

01:13:52.599 --> 01:13:54.926
It's been re-tweeted
like, hundreds of times.

01:13:54.932 --> 01:13:56.060
We do all that again.

01:13:56.061 --> 01:13:57.348
I can't afford to do it again.

01:13:57.351 --> 01:13:59.641
I'm out of money at
the end of the week.

01:13:59.645 --> 01:14:02.525
I definitely don't have
the money to fix all this.

01:14:02.526 --> 01:14:04.362
Then we do it now.

01:14:06.902 --> 01:14:08.242
If you're not
gonna get more time

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:09.816
then you're gonna
need more people.

01:14:09.821 --> 01:14:11.280
It's not all about money.

01:14:11.281 --> 01:14:13.660
Each of you know people
in this business.

01:14:13.661 --> 01:14:16.239
Each of you have
favors you can call in.

01:14:16.244 --> 01:14:17.164
So you just tell
them what happened.

01:14:17.165 --> 01:14:19.747
You ask for their help.

01:14:19.748 --> 01:14:21.708
Put yourselves out there.

01:14:23.085 --> 01:14:25.252
And just see what comes back.

01:14:25.253 --> 01:14:26.593
Yeah.

01:14:26.594 --> 01:14:30.088
I told you I can't
come back in today.

01:14:30.092 --> 01:14:31.382
Yeah, I understand.

01:14:31.385 --> 01:14:33.719
You do what you've gotta do.

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:34.600
Who was that?

01:14:34.601 --> 01:14:35.805
My boss.

01:14:35.806 --> 01:14:38.975
Well, former boss.
I just got fired.

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:39.976
So, I'm in.

01:14:42.437 --> 01:14:43.437
You hiring?

01:15:00.330 --> 01:15:04.500
♪ We are the kids that
would never shut up

01:15:07.045 --> 01:15:11.265
♪ Live in a house but
we sleep in a truck

01:15:13.969 --> 01:15:18.139
♪ Living up, livin'
in a whoa, oh, oh.

01:15:21.476 --> 01:15:24.686
♪ We are the kids that
will never get old

01:15:31.153 --> 01:15:33.195
Okay, he really
trashed the kitchen, man.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:33.986
We're gonna need a plumber,

01:15:33.989 --> 01:15:35.448
and I think maybe
an electrician.

01:15:35.449 --> 01:15:36.819
A lot to do in 24 hours.

01:15:39.494 --> 01:15:41.579
Alright guys, whatever
you need order it.

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.330
If you need more guys
down here let me know.

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.041
Let's just get this done,
we've got until tomorrow.

01:15:44.042 --> 01:15:45.671
Let's go.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:54.757
Who are those people?

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.010
They're my guys.

01:15:57.012 --> 01:15:58.262
I pulled them off another job.

01:15:58.263 --> 01:15:59.813
I hope that's okay.

01:16:07.773 --> 01:16:09.773
Come on, let's get to it.

01:16:26.917 --> 01:16:28.707
Man, I was right there.

01:16:28.710 --> 01:16:32.000
I came this close to
having it perfect.

01:16:36.593 --> 01:16:37.263
Because even if we
do get this done,

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:40.180
she's not gonna be here.

01:16:41.556 --> 01:16:45.556
I don't know why that matters
so much, but, it does.

01:16:53.568 --> 01:16:55.988
I think I'm in love with her.

01:16:58.240 --> 01:16:59.910
Let's take a break.

01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:13.249
When I was about your age, I was

01:17:13.255 --> 01:17:14.425
working in a factory
outside Philly.

01:17:14.426 --> 01:17:16.422
I'd been married seven years.

01:17:16.424 --> 01:17:18.804
Then I met someone.

01:17:20.637 --> 01:17:21.717
Her name was Catherine.

01:17:24.099 --> 01:17:25.849
And, it was effortless.

01:17:27.102 --> 01:17:28.442
Even though she
was married, too.

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:31.516
I'd never loved
like that before,

01:17:31.523 --> 01:17:32.403
or since.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:38.744
Then out of the blue she broke
it off, and destroyed me.

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:45.286
A few months later there
was an awful storm,

01:17:45.287 --> 01:17:49.206
and my wife didn't
come home that night.

01:17:49.207 --> 01:17:50.827
The next morning they found her

01:17:53.211 --> 01:17:56.297
tire tracks were going
off curve in the road,

01:17:56.298 --> 01:17:59.798
front of the car was
wrapped around a tree.

01:18:06.057 --> 01:18:08.726
Then a few years later I
got a letter from a lawyer.

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:11.517
My wife's aunt had died,
and she was the next of kin,

01:18:11.521 --> 01:18:12.811
her or her spouse.

01:18:12.814 --> 01:18:15.816
I worked in that
factory for 10 years,

01:18:15.817 --> 01:18:18.777
then suddenly I didn't have
to work for another 10.

01:18:18.778 --> 01:18:20.487
A couple of days later,
I just found myself

01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:24.238
at Catherine's house, I
got in the car and I just,

01:18:24.242 --> 01:18:27.202
but when I pulled up, I saw
this little girl playing

01:18:27.204 --> 01:18:32.254
in the front yard, and it just
changed it, I just couldn't.

01:18:38.048 --> 01:18:40.838
So I focused on the money,
in five years I doubled it.

01:18:40.842 --> 01:18:44.637
In three years, I'd
double it again.

01:18:44.638 --> 01:18:45.678
It's a dangerous thing
when someone gets money

01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:48.766
who knows what money is worth.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:52.387
So, that is how
I mask my wealth.

01:18:53.813 --> 01:18:55.193
Due mostly to my,

01:18:59.236 --> 01:19:00.945
my good fortune.

01:19:00.946 --> 01:19:03.106
I don't know if
I'd call it that.

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.034
All I know is when I got
the check, I didn't know if

01:19:05.035 --> 01:19:09.043
it was right or wrong, I just
knew sure as shit I wanted it.

01:19:10.538 --> 01:19:14.248
And then a few months
ago, I got another letter

01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:18.209
from another lawyer,
settling Catherine's estate.

01:19:18.213 --> 01:19:22.758
She had told them to
send it after her death.

01:19:22.759 --> 01:19:23.929
And her letter,

01:19:27.222 --> 01:19:29.060
she said that she
always loved me,

01:19:29.061 --> 01:19:32.687
and that she thought once about
leaving her husband for me,

01:19:32.688 --> 01:19:35.936
but when she found out she was
pregnant, she couldn't do it.

01:19:40.568 --> 01:19:43.487
It's been so long being
so hungry to make money.

01:19:43.488 --> 01:19:45.028
If I could give up that money,

01:19:46.992 --> 01:19:52.288
and have Catherine be in
my life, to have a family,

01:19:52.289 --> 01:19:56.667
and live the kind of life
that other guy lived,

01:19:56.668 --> 01:19:59.128
I would do it in a heartbeat.

01:20:02.090 --> 01:20:06.590
All we ever really have is what
we have in any given moment.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:10.854
So we decide what we do with
it, and who we share it with.

01:20:11.808 --> 01:20:13.808
I want to hold on
to what I have now,

01:20:13.810 --> 01:20:17.230
who I have, while they're here.

01:20:19.232 --> 01:20:22.032
You don't have to know
how you go on without her,

01:20:22.033 --> 01:20:24.897
if you go on without
her, you just,

01:20:31.453 --> 01:20:32.793
you just will.

01:20:37.751 --> 01:20:39.791
This is not a bad view.

01:20:41.087 --> 01:20:43.047
It's not as nice as yours.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:49.639
Sometimes it's nice
to see another one.

01:21:02.776 --> 01:21:03.726
Sun's up.

01:21:04.819 --> 01:21:06.489
You should go home
and get some rest.

01:21:06.490 --> 01:21:07.818
I'll go when I'm done.

01:21:07.822 --> 01:21:09.281
This bar looked great before.

01:21:09.282 --> 01:21:11.241
I want to get it
perfect for you.

01:21:11.242 --> 01:21:12.332
It's not gonna be perfect.

01:21:12.333 --> 01:21:14.657
But it will be good enough
to serve people food,

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:16.705
and that will be enough.

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:17.786
Go home, rest.

01:21:17.791 --> 01:21:19.416
You rest.

01:21:19.417 --> 01:21:20.287
You gotta cook tonight.

01:21:20.293 --> 01:21:21.173
I do,

01:21:22.337 --> 01:21:24.757
'cause I'm a chef,
it's what I'm good at.

01:21:24.758 --> 01:21:28.876
I'm not good at
inspiring people,

01:21:28.885 --> 01:21:31.428
making a staff
feel like a family,

01:21:31.429 --> 01:21:33.679
not like you're good at it.

01:21:34.933 --> 01:21:36.433
That's why you have to go home,

01:21:36.434 --> 01:21:40.314
come back fresh, ready
to lead a staff all day.

01:21:43.191 --> 01:21:45.901
That's why I had this drawn up.

01:21:51.324 --> 01:21:54.494
Sign it, and half
this place is yours.

01:21:55.745 --> 01:21:59.125
It's the way it was
always supposed to be.

01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:05.999
Alek, I couldn't sleep, I
was worried, where were you?

01:22:06.005 --> 01:22:06.715
At Sam's, working.

01:22:06.716 --> 01:22:09.091
You were working all night?

01:22:09.092 --> 01:22:10.551
Don't you have to
go to work today?

01:22:10.552 --> 01:22:11.892
Not anymore.

01:22:12.554 --> 01:22:14.764
They fired me.

01:22:21.396 --> 01:22:22.226
Where you going?

01:22:22.230 --> 01:22:22.980
Work.

01:22:22.981 --> 01:22:24.271
Someone has to.

01:22:35.785 --> 01:22:37.625
I still have these.

01:22:38.746 --> 01:22:41.866
I never asked for them back.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:42.425
How are you feeling?

01:22:42.426 --> 01:22:44.037
Awful.

01:22:46.212 --> 01:22:48.088
How's your boyfriend?

01:22:48.089 --> 01:22:49.589
He's not my boyfriend.

01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:51.758
We're not together.

01:22:51.759 --> 01:22:54.849
It seems like you
two are together.

01:22:55.555 --> 01:22:56.225
Not after this.

01:22:59.767 --> 01:23:02.267
You really don't
want to be with him?

01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:04.730
I don't want to be with anyone.

01:23:04.731 --> 01:23:08.231
I just want to go
away, be alone.

01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:09.744
Figure things out.

01:23:11.696 --> 01:23:14.026
I'm sorry things
turned out this way.

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:15.122
I meant it then, when
I told you I would

01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:19.156
be with you for the
rest of my life.

01:23:19.162 --> 01:23:20.542
What about now?

01:23:22.749 --> 01:23:25.249
Now I'm gonna go.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:45.651
Sarah?

01:23:48.775 --> 01:23:49.655
I'm sorry.

01:24:00.328 --> 01:24:01.368
Good morning.

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:04.079
What are you grinning for?

01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:08.001
Let's just hope nobody
leans on the walls.

01:24:08.002 --> 01:24:08.462
It looks good.

01:24:18.012 --> 01:24:20.556
They were short
on the skate wing.

01:24:20.557 --> 01:24:24.807
I got what they had, but
it's not enough for the main.

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.440
Fuck it, squid ink
risotto, Jersey Shore style.

01:24:35.363 --> 01:24:38.031
You can do that, right?

01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:53.839
Just add a little more garlic.

01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.760
Keep it simmering, just a few
minutes, don't over do it.

01:24:55.761 --> 01:24:57.798
20 minutes.

01:24:57.802 --> 01:24:58.722
What if no one comes?

01:24:58.723 --> 01:25:01.260
We're gonna have
a lot of leftovers.

01:25:01.264 --> 01:25:02.064
I need a drink.

01:25:02.065 --> 01:25:03.426
You need a drink?

01:25:03.433 --> 01:25:04.561
Hey, you guys got any rope?

01:25:04.562 --> 01:25:05.389
Rope?

01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:09.313
Well, poster tape or something.

01:25:09.314 --> 01:25:10.234
What's the hell's
he talking about?

01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:12.981
Something to control the line.

01:25:45.558 --> 01:25:48.228
Hey, who are all of those
people in the nice clothes?

01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:52.057
Oh, I may have told
everyone in my Rolodex

01:25:52.065 --> 01:25:54.608
that this was the
place to be tonight.

01:25:54.609 --> 01:25:55.439
Thank you.

01:25:56.486 --> 01:25:58.396
So much, for everything.

01:25:58.863 --> 01:26:01.490
Yeah, mwuah!

01:26:14.962 --> 01:26:18.131
It is a beautiful thing,
seeing all of you here tonight,

01:26:18.132 --> 01:26:21.468
at the opening of
my son's restaurant.

01:26:32.146 --> 01:26:35.186
When my last place went
under, and I said I was

01:26:35.191 --> 01:26:37.031
gonna open another, at
this time in this town,

01:26:37.032 --> 01:26:40.146
I was told "You're crazy".

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.240
At first I listened
to those voices.

01:26:45.243 --> 01:26:49.293
I wasn't crazy enough
to take the risk,

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:02.092
and it is risky, doing this.

01:27:03.261 --> 01:27:06.391
But if you know my son,
this business is who he is.

01:27:08.766 --> 01:27:10.516
And a man who pretends
to be anything

01:27:10.518 --> 01:27:14.058
other than what he is
becomes his shadow.

01:27:15.064 --> 01:27:17.364
So many of you helped
put this place together.

01:27:17.365 --> 01:27:20.986
Tonight only happened
because you let yourselves

01:27:20.987 --> 01:27:24.777
believe in the crazy
that was somebody else's.

01:27:25.533 --> 01:27:28.543
And when you find those people,

01:27:30.121 --> 01:27:33.871
that person, who sees our
crazy and still shows up,

01:27:36.335 --> 01:27:39.215
then you agree to
be who you are.

01:27:39.922 --> 01:27:42.422
And that's the only way to be.

01:28:19.921 --> 01:28:20.751
Please leave

01:28:20.755 --> 01:28:22.765
a message and I'll
call you back.

01:28:22.766 --> 01:28:23.917
Hey. It's me.

01:28:25.176 --> 01:28:28.546
I know you said not
to call, but I had to.

01:28:30.765 --> 01:28:31.685
Hear that?

01:28:33.184 --> 01:28:36.436
Like the sound of
hundred people inside.

01:28:36.437 --> 01:28:39.397
I tried to do this once before
in New York, and I couldn't.

01:28:39.398 --> 01:28:39.848
I think maybe

01:28:41.859 --> 01:28:45.609
it only worked out this
time because I had you.

01:28:45.613 --> 01:28:47.572
It feels like you should
be here, you know?

01:28:47.573 --> 01:28:52.583
I should feel happy but I can't
be 'cause you're not here.

01:28:55.915 --> 01:28:57.585
Feels wrong if you're not here.

01:29:00.628 --> 01:29:04.418
Anyway, I know that you
need some time to think, but

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:08.133
if you wanted to come
by, just for tonight to

01:29:10.471 --> 01:29:11.601
see this, I'd love that.

01:29:16.769 --> 01:29:18.899
And if not, know I'm here,

01:29:21.107 --> 01:29:24.687
whenever you're done
thinking, I'll be here.

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:26.810
No bullshit.

01:30:31.469 --> 01:30:33.549
This could well become

01:30:33.554 --> 01:30:35.931
another super storm,
Hurricane Ingrid.

01:30:35.932 --> 01:30:37.932
Head
north toward the East Coast,

01:30:37.934 --> 01:30:40.731
head west to New Mexico,
dissipate at sea.

01:30:40.732 --> 01:30:42.228
What we do know is right now...

01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:43.357
Hurricane, if it's path

01:30:43.358 --> 01:30:45.016
runs up the eastern
seaboard, it could make land

01:30:45.024 --> 01:30:47.692
fall at the Jersey Shore
in four to five days.

01:30:47.693 --> 01:30:48.533
Hey.

01:30:49.278 --> 01:30:52.238
Hey, Mister Blake.

01:30:52.239 --> 01:30:54.029
Alek, great to see you.

01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:55.742
Uh, saw the sandbags,
you getting nervous?

01:30:55.743 --> 01:30:57.243
We're gonna be as
ready as we can be.

01:30:57.244 --> 01:30:58.954
You goin' up tonight?

01:30:58.955 --> 01:30:59.413
Yeah.

01:30:59.414 --> 01:31:00.213
Is Sam here?

01:31:00.214 --> 01:31:01.706
He's in the back.

01:31:01.707 --> 01:31:03.917
You didn't tell him
to take the night off?

01:31:03.918 --> 01:31:05.588
I tried, he's a partner now,

01:31:05.589 --> 01:31:08.296
I can't tell him shit anymore.

01:31:17.515 --> 01:31:19.391
So, you decide?

01:31:19.392 --> 01:31:21.312
Not yet, apparently.

01:31:23.229 --> 01:31:24.896
You'd be proud of her.

01:31:24.897 --> 01:31:26.187
She's worked really hard
to open up this shop.

01:31:26.190 --> 01:31:29.190
Yeah, she sent me this.

01:31:30.152 --> 01:31:31.112
Place is great.

01:31:31.113 --> 01:31:32.988
Shop only opens once.

01:31:32.989 --> 01:31:35.198
Come see it.

01:31:35.199 --> 01:31:37.409
I don't know if she wants me to.

01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:40.500
We haven't talked much; A
few emails and texts, so.

01:31:40.501 --> 01:31:42.706
Look, the place is slammed,

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.286
I've got a possible storm
coming in four days.

01:31:45.292 --> 01:31:46.542
She said she'd let me know
when she wanted to talk.

01:31:46.544 --> 01:31:48.594
Just tryin' to do
what she asked.

01:31:48.595 --> 01:31:52.007
You still think
you're in love with her?

01:31:52.008 --> 01:31:54.088
I know I am.

01:31:56.637 --> 01:32:00.177
You once told me that
making good things happen

01:32:00.182 --> 01:32:03.812
was about knowing your
moment, and taking it.

01:32:05.563 --> 01:32:07.403
That was good advice.

01:32:10.109 --> 01:32:11.479
I'm gonna go grab
a bite at the bar

01:32:11.485 --> 01:32:13.194
and hit the road in
about 30 minutes.

01:32:13.195 --> 01:32:14.075
Yeah.

01:32:41.182 --> 01:32:43.022
Excuse me.

01:32:45.227 --> 01:32:47.517
You made it.

01:32:47.521 --> 01:32:48.688
Of course.

01:32:48.689 --> 01:32:50.359
Oh, I had to come
check on my investment.

01:32:50.360 --> 01:32:52.027
Everything's going so well.

01:32:52.028 --> 01:32:54.486
It's a good crowd, I think
it's gonna be a good opening.

01:32:54.487 --> 01:32:56.397
I'm so proud of you.

01:33:02.369 --> 01:33:04.579
I'm gonna go get a drink.

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:17.383
I didn't know if
you were gonna come.

01:33:17.384 --> 01:33:18.724
I didn't know if
you wanted me to come.

01:33:18.725 --> 01:33:21.259
Well, I know you
have the place to run

01:33:21.263 --> 01:33:22.889
and the storm is coming.

01:33:22.890 --> 01:33:24.720
None of that matters.

01:33:26.268 --> 01:33:27.138
'Cause,

01:33:29.605 --> 01:33:30.655
I love you.

01:33:31.565 --> 01:33:34.109
There's always gonna be a storm,

01:33:34.110 --> 01:33:35.740
there's always gonna
be things to deal with.

01:33:35.741 --> 01:33:39.856
And that you've got this
place now, it's amazing.

01:33:41.951 --> 01:33:44.081
I'm not asking you
to give any of it up.

01:33:44.082 --> 01:33:47.538
I'm two hours away
we can figure it out.

01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:51.330
But I'd like to figure
it out with you, 'cause

01:33:51.919 --> 01:33:53.839
I wanna be with you.

01:33:55.089 --> 01:34:00.089
There is nowhere else I would
rather be tonight than here.

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:07.560
I'm done.

01:34:10.563 --> 01:34:12.063
I'm done thinking.
