00:02.702 --> 00:05.303
? Boy, the way Glen Miller played ?

00:05.370 --> 00:09.074
? songs that made the hit parade ?

00:09.141 --> 00:12.711
? guys like us, we had it made ?

00:19.986 --> 00:23.621

00:55.887 --> 00:57.088
good morning, ma.

00:57.155 --> 00:58.690
Good morning.

00:58.757 --> 01:00.725
Well, what's the matter,
you got a headache?

01:00.792 --> 01:01.859
Not yet.

01:01.927 --> 01:05.796
These are for the one I'm gonna get.

01:05.864 --> 01:09.900
Ma, don't be afraid. You're only
gonna be asking people for a job.

01:09.968 --> 01:14.872
Oh, I ain't afraid of the askin'.
I'm afraid of the answers.

01:14.940 --> 01:17.808
Ma, worrying is not gonna
help you find a job.

01:17.876 --> 01:19.110
Now don't be so nervous.

01:19.177 --> 01:21.512
Oh, I can't help it, Gloria.

01:21.580 --> 01:25.250
I protected my underarms twice already.

01:27.786 --> 01:31.122
Uh, the 2nd time I used Archie's deodorant.

01:31.189 --> 01:34.392
The one with the brute strength.

01:34.460 --> 01:38.829
But I still feel weak everywhere else.

01:38.897 --> 01:40.698
Ma, when you walk into those offices

01:40.766 --> 01:44.001
you gotta say to yourself,
"I'm gonna get that job."

01:44.069 --> 01:46.271
Do you understand what I'm saying, ma?

01:46.338 --> 01:49.240
You--you gotta think positive.

01:49.308 --> 01:53.578
Yeah, but why don't they think
positive and say, "we don't want you."

01:54.546 --> 01:56.847
Ma, don't sell yourself short.

01:56.915 --> 02:00.217
It ain't my height I'm worried about.

02:00.286 --> 02:04.689
It's ju-just that I ain't done
this sort of thing for years.

02:04.757 --> 02:06.891
25 years.

02:06.958 --> 02:11.095
Well, maybe you should have. Maybe daddy's
being on strike is a blessing in disguise.

02:11.330 --> 02:14.899
There ain't no blessin' in all
them bills that gotta be paid.

02:14.967 --> 02:18.937
Heh, I remember daddy saying he thought
the strike would be over by the weekend.

02:19.004 --> 02:22.173
Oh, yeah. That was 3 weekends ago.

02:22.241 --> 02:25.209
Sometimes I think it will never end.

02:25.277 --> 02:29.013
Oh, ma, don't worry. You're gonna
go out there and knock 'em dead.

02:29.081 --> 02:31.149
You're gonna get a job just like that.

02:31.216 --> 02:34.385
Oh, yeah. Well, maybe you're right.

02:34.453 --> 02:36.687
Oh, thanks, Gloria.

02:36.755 --> 02:38.622
You made me feel better.

02:38.690 --> 02:40.992
You see, all it takes is confidence.

02:41.060 --> 02:43.094
Hey, who's been readin' <i>the New York times?</i>

02:43.162 --> 02:46.331
Me. I've been readin' the help wanted ads.

02:46.398 --> 02:49.334
Yeah, yeah. Well, I wouldn't
get my hopes up too high, ma.

02:53.072 --> 02:54.738
Yeah, the way the economy is goin',

02:54.806 --> 02:56.140
it's not that easy to get a job.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.476
Uh, Michael.

02:58.543 --> 03:01.012
Well, it's true. Look at me. I've been
tryin' to get a part-time job for 3 weeks.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.013
It's impossible.

03:02.081 --> 03:03.214
Michael.

03:03.282 --> 03:04.715
And I am a lot younger than ma.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.085
Michael, shut up.

03:08.154 --> 03:10.622
Ma-- I know, Gloria.

03:10.689 --> 03:12.390
Positive thinking.

03:15.494 --> 03:16.861
Oh, boy, you're a big help.

03:16.928 --> 03:19.430
Well, I'm sorry. I--I
didn't mean anything by it.

03:19.498 --> 03:22.367
Hey, uh, ma. Uh, I'm sorry. I really--
I really didn't mean anything.

03:22.434 --> 03:24.068
Oh, that's all right, Mike.

03:24.136 --> 03:26.971
How do I look? You look fine.

03:27.039 --> 03:30.341
You don't think this
dress is too revealing?

03:32.144 --> 03:35.112
I don't think I should look too sexy.

03:36.782 --> 03:38.249
Don't worry, ma. You never do.

03:42.154 --> 03:43.888
So what kind of job you lookin' for?

03:43.955 --> 03:46.224
Well, somethin' that pays good,

03:46.292 --> 03:49.661
but don't need no previous experience.

03:49.728 --> 03:51.929
Have you thought about goin' into politics?

03:54.332 --> 03:57.068
I'm gonna see about 3 clerkin' jobs

03:57.136 --> 03:59.470
and then a receptionist.

03:59.538 --> 04:03.041
That's what I think I'd like to do.
Receptin'.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.276
Ma.

04:05.343 --> 04:08.212
Did you see all the firms here that
are advertisin' for a girl Friday?

04:08.280 --> 04:10.715
Oh, yeah, I saw them,

04:10.783 --> 04:13.685
but one day's work wouldn't be enough.

04:14.820 --> 04:16.620
I gotta get goin'.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.890
You know what they say.

04:18.957 --> 04:22.026
"The early bird catches the worm."

04:22.094 --> 04:24.062
Yeah, and also leaves the house

04:24.129 --> 04:26.698
before Archie finds out what it's doin'.

04:26.765 --> 04:30.001
Oh, you figured that out, huh?

04:30.069 --> 04:32.236
Well, wish me luck. Good luck, ma.

04:32.304 --> 04:34.072
Go on, ma. You can do it.

04:34.139 --> 04:35.940
Oh, my, I feel just like a teenager

04:36.008 --> 04:39.944
when I first started goin'
out on job interviews.

04:40.012 --> 04:42.880
Only now I can hold my head up.

04:42.948 --> 04:45.249
Because of the self-confidence
I gave you, right?

04:45.317 --> 04:49.020
No. Now I ain't got no pimples to hide.

04:50.489 --> 04:52.223
Bye. (Gloria) Bye, ma.

04:59.932 --> 05:03.935
She's really somethin'. After all
these years lookin' for a job.

05:04.003 --> 05:05.803
Boy, she's quite a woman.

05:05.871 --> 05:07.071
Yeah, isn't she?

05:07.139 --> 05:09.007
Yeah. Almost makes up for your father.

05:10.609 --> 05:12.176
I know, I shouldn't knock him.

05:12.244 --> 05:15.079
After all he did one thing
that no other man could do.

05:15.147 --> 05:16.480
He made you.

05:16.548 --> 05:19.316
Oh, Michael, that's lovely.

05:26.458 --> 05:27.491
Oh, look at this.

05:30.462 --> 05:33.164
Come right off the picket
line into a massage parlor.

05:35.801 --> 05:39.737
On the other hand, Gloria,
maybe you're adopted.

05:39.805 --> 05:42.706
Was that your mother I just
seen gallopin' down the street?

05:42.775 --> 05:44.042
Uh, probably.

05:44.109 --> 05:46.044
Uh, Michael, would you
help me in the kitchen

05:46.111 --> 05:48.046
with the grocery shopping list? Yeah, sure.

05:48.113 --> 05:51.048
I promised ma I'd pick some up on the way home.
Wait, wait a minute.

05:51.116 --> 05:53.218
Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute.

05:53.285 --> 05:55.587
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talkin' to you.

05:55.654 --> 05:57.822
That was your mother
runnin' down the street.

05:57.890 --> 05:59.591
Well, then what are you askin' me for?

05:59.658 --> 06:00.725
Uh, butter. Got it.

06:00.793 --> 06:02.861
Because I want to know
what the hell she's up to.

06:02.928 --> 06:04.261
Uh, dozen eggs.

06:04.329 --> 06:06.364
I yelled to her. She didn't
even look back at me.

06:06.431 --> 06:08.132
Maybe she thought you were a mugger.

06:11.370 --> 06:13.104
That's a thought.

06:13.171 --> 06:14.205
Here's another thought.

06:14.273 --> 06:15.273
[Razzing]

06:20.112 --> 06:22.580
That reminds me, raspberries.

06:22.648 --> 06:26.250
Don't be givin' me a headache on
top of the headache I already got.

06:26.318 --> 06:28.019
This inflation and the unemployment.

06:28.087 --> 06:30.221
I'm worried about goin' broke.

06:30.288 --> 06:32.256
The whole country is
worried about goin' broke.

06:32.324 --> 06:33.858
Not the defense industries.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.461
Oh, there he goes rappin'
the Pentagon again.

06:36.528 --> 06:38.262
Milk.

06:38.330 --> 06:40.398
If it was up to youse liberals,
we would have no defense at all.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.866
You don't want us to have nothin'.

06:41.934 --> 06:44.869
No armaments, no navaments, nothin'.

06:44.937 --> 06:48.706
You'd have us runnin' along the
beaches in our jockey shorts.

06:48.774 --> 06:52.276
Tryin' to catch the Russian
missiles with butterfly nets.

06:52.344 --> 06:55.913
Arch, this country has enough
bombs to kill the whole world

06:55.981 --> 06:57.949
20 times over, so has Russia.

06:58.017 --> 07:02.286
When we can kill it 30 times over,
we'll sleep peaceful at night.

07:02.354 --> 07:04.155
Look at you, what do you want us to be?

07:04.222 --> 07:07.058
Weak? Like Norway was in world war ii?

07:07.126 --> 07:09.460
Arch, I am not saying we should eliminate

07:09.528 --> 07:11.195
our defense budget altogether.

07:11.263 --> 07:14.866
But this administration cut the
mass transit budget by half.

07:14.933 --> 07:16.701
At least in Norway they had buses.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.803
Ah, buses, buses. Sure, they had buses.

07:18.871 --> 07:20.838
That's why the norways lost the war.

07:21.874 --> 07:24.441
(Both) What?

07:24.509 --> 07:27.078
That's right. When the Germans
come marchin' into their country,

07:27.145 --> 07:28.746
they didn't know what was happenin'.

07:28.814 --> 07:30.381
They was all ridin' on the buses.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.786
Now, what is it with your mother?

07:35.855 --> 07:36.821
Nothin'.

07:36.889 --> 07:38.622
Gloria, we might as well tell him.

07:38.690 --> 07:40.258
He's gonna find out sooner or later.

07:40.326 --> 07:42.493
Come on, what? What? What?

07:42.561 --> 07:44.028
She went lookin' for a job.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.231
Oh, is that all?

07:47.399 --> 07:48.900
You're not mad?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.468
Why should I be mad?

07:50.535 --> 07:52.370
I don't keep her under
lock and key around here.

07:52.437 --> 07:54.539
Do I look like Simon McGee?

07:54.606 --> 07:56.274
Let her go out anytime she wants.

07:56.341 --> 07:58.476
Let her look for a job. She
ain't gonna find nothin'.

07:58.544 --> 08:02.046
Oh, yeah. What makes you so sure?
Oh, come on, little girl.

08:02.113 --> 08:06.818
There's 10 guys out there scratchin'
and clawin' for every job.

08:06.885 --> 08:10.688
And as Leo durocher said,
"nice guys finish last."

08:10.756 --> 08:13.557
What's that got to do with ma?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.693
Did you ever see a nicer
guy than your mother?

08:27.072 --> 08:28.673
Who's that comin' in now?

08:28.741 --> 08:31.009
Oh, it's only me, Archie.

08:31.076 --> 08:32.809
Oh, it's only you, Edith.

08:34.346 --> 08:36.580
I'll get your dinner right away.

08:36.649 --> 08:39.951
Yeah, get my dinner right away, huh?
Did you get the job?

08:39.953 --> 08:42.152
No.

08:42.220 --> 08:45.790
How did you know I was lookin' for a job?

08:45.857 --> 08:48.258
Oh, jeez, Edith. It's in the papers.

08:52.096 --> 08:55.065
Edith bunker out huntin' a job.

08:55.133 --> 08:58.035
Governor declares New York a disaster area.

08:59.304 --> 09:01.772
Oh, Archie. It was awful.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.140
[Sighing]

09:03.208 --> 09:05.909
I had to wait one place a whole hour.

09:05.977 --> 09:09.680
And when I finally got in
the man said, "too old."

09:11.850 --> 09:13.317
I ain't surprised, Edith.

09:13.385 --> 09:15.319
I mean, after all you're over the hill.

09:18.123 --> 09:21.225
I ain't over the hill.

09:21.293 --> 09:23.361
Well, you can certainly see the top of it.

09:26.931 --> 09:30.301
Well, maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.503
Oh, what do you mean "tomorrow," Edith?

09:32.570 --> 09:35.439
Now, come on. You ain't gonna
go out there again tomorrow.

09:35.507 --> 09:37.475
I mean, don't you learn your lesson?

09:37.542 --> 09:40.411
After all, I mean, uh, if a
woman ain't got no experience,

09:40.479 --> 09:43.447
then she ought to stick to unskilled
labor, like bein' a wife.

09:44.749 --> 09:47.284
But that don't pay nothin'.

09:47.352 --> 09:49.887
Because it ain't supposed
to pay nothin', Edith.

09:49.954 --> 09:52.623
You're supposed to be satisfied
with your, what do you call,

09:52.690 --> 09:54.492
unseen rewards.

09:54.559 --> 09:57.461
How would you like an unseen dinner?

10:06.338 --> 10:09.873
Well, don't bite the face off of me.

10:09.941 --> 10:14.045
I am just sayin' that somebody better
bring some money in this house.

10:14.112 --> 10:15.646
And soon.

10:15.713 --> 10:18.349
Well, somebody will. But that
somebody will be wearin' pants,

10:18.417 --> 10:19.917
not panties.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.755
Archie, I'm worried.

10:24.822 --> 10:27.624
What are you worryin' about?
You see me worryin'?

10:27.692 --> 10:29.626
Yeah.

10:29.694 --> 10:32.263
Well, all right. I am the one
that's supposed to be worryin'.

10:32.330 --> 10:34.098
I am supposed to be doin' that.

10:34.166 --> 10:37.868
You are supposed to just
say, uh, <i>"c'est LA vie".</i>

10:37.936 --> 10:40.704
As the French used to say when the
Germans were slaughterin' 'em.

10:44.642 --> 10:47.044
Talkin' about slaughter,
what have we got for dinner?

10:48.046 --> 10:49.613
Chicken croquets,

10:49.681 --> 10:52.783
and cherry gelatin for dessert.

10:52.850 --> 10:56.220
Cherry gelatin again!

10:56.288 --> 10:58.055
But you like cherries?

10:58.123 --> 11:01.291
I love cherries, but not
when they're set in rubber.

11:04.162 --> 11:09.132
Oh, I'll add some extra water
so it will be more shaky.

11:09.200 --> 11:13.470
Ah, jeez, I'll be chasin'
it all over the plate.

11:15.307 --> 11:16.774
[Knocking on door]

11:16.841 --> 11:18.976
Oh, come in, Louise.

11:19.044 --> 11:21.612
Hi, did you get the job?

11:21.680 --> 11:23.214
Oh, no.

11:23.282 --> 11:27.118
Oh, it was awful, Louise. Nobody wants me.

11:27.186 --> 11:30.221
I even went to the
Hercules plumbing company

11:30.289 --> 11:33.691
where I used to work when Archie
and me was goin' together.

11:33.758 --> 11:35.393
What did they say?

11:35.461 --> 11:38.729
They didn't say nothin'
. They're a parkin' lot now.

11:40.832 --> 11:44.202
Still no sign of Archie's
strike ending, huh? No.

11:46.105 --> 11:48.639
Edith, how are your figures?

11:49.874 --> 11:52.110
Oh, I ain't no miss America.

11:53.712 --> 11:57.482
Like all them younger girls
that are lookin' for jobs.

11:57.549 --> 12:00.884
No, I mean money figures, counting figures.

12:00.952 --> 12:03.187
Could you learn how to
work a cash register?

12:03.922 --> 12:05.489
Can you learn that?

12:05.557 --> 12:07.058
I could teach you.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.026
Oh, well, I guess I could.

12:09.094 --> 12:10.194
Great.

12:10.262 --> 12:11.695
George don't know it yet,

12:11.763 --> 12:14.298
but I just found someone to
help in the cleaning store.

12:14.366 --> 12:15.366
Who?

12:15.434 --> 12:18.402
You. You can come and work for us.

12:20.038 --> 12:21.872
Louise.

12:21.940 --> 12:25.209
Oh, oh, I love it.

12:25.276 --> 12:26.910
Oh, Louise.

12:26.978 --> 12:29.980
Oh, but are you sure you want me?

12:30.048 --> 12:32.817
Oh, I'd probably start
gabbing with the customers

12:32.884 --> 12:34.952
and forget to give 'em their change.

12:35.019 --> 12:38.088
Oh, that won't bother George none.

12:38.156 --> 12:39.990
You can start tomorrow morning.

12:40.058 --> 12:41.692
Oh, Louise, thank you.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.761
Now I'll go and give him the good news.

12:43.829 --> 12:45.629
Will he be surprised.

12:48.233 --> 12:50.067
So will Archie.

12:51.936 --> 12:54.104
Oh, Archie!

12:54.172 --> 12:55.573
Wake up!

12:56.708 --> 12:58.275
I got a surprise.

12:58.343 --> 13:00.911
One of these days you're gonna
surprise me with a heart attack.

13:02.146 --> 13:04.015
Now what is it?

13:04.082 --> 13:06.517
No, I can't tell you yet

13:06.585 --> 13:09.186
'cause I got to go get a little surprise

13:09.253 --> 13:11.489
to celebrate the big surprise.

13:11.556 --> 13:15.526
No, Edith, I don't think I can take
one surprise on top of another.

13:15.594 --> 13:18.362
Don't you like me bringin' home surprises?

13:18.430 --> 13:20.598
Oh, Edith, with you a
surprise could be anything

13:20.666 --> 13:22.700
from a runaway horse to a puerto rican.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.736
It's even better.

13:25.803 --> 13:27.605
I'll be right back.

13:27.672 --> 13:29.039
[Groaning]

13:31.176 --> 13:34.011
She's bringin' me a surprise.
Help me, lord.

13:40.719 --> 13:43.187
You just did what, Louise?

13:43.254 --> 13:46.623
I told Edith she could
have the job in the store.

13:48.559 --> 13:51.561
No way, Louise. No way!

13:51.629 --> 13:53.163
But, George-- there's no way

13:53.231 --> 13:55.699
that honky's wife is
gonna come in my store.

13:56.934 --> 13:59.103
Except with a bundle of
cleanin' in one hand

13:59.170 --> 14:01.438
and some ready cash in the other.

14:01.506 --> 14:04.141
George, those people are
havin' a hard time.

14:04.209 --> 14:06.010
So are we people.

14:06.077 --> 14:08.012
The only difference between them and us

14:08.079 --> 14:12.349
is that our people have had
300 years of practice.

14:12.417 --> 14:15.452
But it'll only be until
Archie's strike is over.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.687
That could be 5,000 months from now.

14:17.755 --> 14:20.057
What are people gonna think
when they come in the store

14:20.125 --> 14:22.393
and see a white face standin'
on behind the counter?

14:22.460 --> 14:23.560
What would they think?

14:23.628 --> 14:24.861
What would they think?

14:24.929 --> 14:26.497
The niggers'll think she owns the store

14:26.564 --> 14:28.832
and the honkies'll will think
we've bleached the help.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.876
George, you don't realize
that times have changed.

14:39.944 --> 14:42.979
People ain't as dumb as you are anymore.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.449
Just last Sunday, reverend Hamilton said,

14:45.517 --> 14:47.484
"we were all brothers under the skin."

14:47.552 --> 14:49.186
Sure, he gets paid to say that.

14:50.855 --> 14:52.822
Bunker ain't no brother of mine.

14:52.890 --> 14:56.393
He ain't no distant relative. In fact,
he don't even make a good stranger.

14:56.461 --> 15:00.430
No job, Louise. That's final.

15:00.498 --> 15:01.464
Now,

15:03.901 --> 15:05.302
what's for dinner, dear?

15:08.306 --> 15:10.474
All right, George. You win.

15:10.541 --> 15:12.709
I knew you'd see it my way eventually.

15:12.777 --> 15:16.646
After all, you'd only be drivin'
poor Archie out of his mind.

15:16.714 --> 15:17.547
Say what?

15:18.984 --> 15:20.450
I said you were right, as usual.

15:20.518 --> 15:22.887
No, no, what did you say about bunker?

15:22.954 --> 15:25.956
I said you'd drive poor
Archie out of his mind

15:26.024 --> 15:28.659
when he hear Edith's going to work for you.

15:28.726 --> 15:31.762
He'd probably jump off the
George Washington bridge.

15:31.830 --> 15:33.197
[Chuckling]

15:33.265 --> 15:36.834
But the queensborough bridge is closer.

15:36.902 --> 15:38.502
And I could watch him from here.

15:39.237 --> 15:40.671
George!

15:40.738 --> 15:43.874
Settled. I said she's got the job.

15:57.088 --> 15:58.455
Nothin'.

16:00.591 --> 16:03.527
Well, give the deck 3 chances

16:05.230 --> 16:06.230
then you cheat.

16:13.605 --> 16:14.704
Hiya, daddy.

16:16.574 --> 16:18.809
Where's ma?

16:18.876 --> 16:22.146
I don't know. She took off out of
here like a dingbat out of hell.

16:22.213 --> 16:24.448
Why, what happened? She get a job?

16:24.516 --> 16:26.984
Ah, she didn't get no job.

16:27.051 --> 16:30.420
Oh, well, I'm goin' upstairs to freshen up.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.522
Yeah.

16:33.391 --> 16:35.158
Ah, jeez, I hate this game.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.530
I'm back.

16:39.597 --> 16:41.232
Oh, you're back, are you, Edith?

16:41.299 --> 16:44.534
Surprise.

16:44.602 --> 16:47.437
Look out. You blew the game on me here.

16:47.505 --> 16:50.707
Hold it, hold it. That is a surprise.
Pastore's bakery.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.778
Don't tell me you brung home somethin'
good for dessert for a change.

16:53.845 --> 16:56.046
Yeah, and I was very lucky,

16:56.114 --> 16:57.848
'cause it was just closin'.

16:57.916 --> 17:02.052
Mr. pastore likes to get upstairs
to watch Walter cronkite.

17:02.120 --> 17:07.258
He thinks they might be related
'cause they got the same eyebrows.

17:07.325 --> 17:10.661
Oh, Edith, I'm thinkin' of one of
them big delicious chocolate cake

17:10.728 --> 17:13.229
with all the nuts on the top.
It ain't one of them?

17:13.297 --> 17:14.897
That's right, it ain't.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.337
And it's better.

17:20.404 --> 17:24.708
Whoa, hey, hey, hey, ho,
ho, ho, hold it there.

17:26.144 --> 17:28.812
What is this, "happy bar mitzvah, Irving."

17:35.386 --> 17:36.686
Who the hell is Irving?

17:38.323 --> 17:41.225
He's the little boy that got the mumps.

17:41.292 --> 17:45.295
So his mother didn't come
and pick up the cake.

17:45.363 --> 17:48.798
Well, how are we gonna eat this?
This is a Jewish cake, Edith.

17:51.336 --> 17:54.471
They give this to a kid
before he gets circumscribed.

17:59.911 --> 18:02.612
It was on sale, Archie.

18:02.680 --> 18:05.015
This is a $10 cake.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.384
I got it for $1.

18:09.287 --> 18:12.222
Couldn't they give you somethin'
that said "merry Christmas, Irving"?

18:13.424 --> 18:15.725
Oh, I don't think so.

18:15.793 --> 18:19.863
Anyway, that would be stale by now.

18:19.931 --> 18:23.334
All right, cut out my chunk from
the part that says, "happy" there.

18:23.401 --> 18:24.768
All right.

18:24.836 --> 18:27.204
And leave the "bar mitzvah"
part for the meathead.

18:28.606 --> 18:31.208
He ain't a Jew, but he'll eat
anythin' that ain't movin'.

18:33.511 --> 18:35.746
Oh, Archie,

18:35.814 --> 18:38.915
I got a job.

18:38.983 --> 18:41.918
You got a job. I thought you
said you couldn't get no job.

18:41.986 --> 18:44.487
I got a job, I got a job.

18:44.555 --> 18:46.757
Oh, wait a minute. From George Jefferson.

18:46.825 --> 18:49.459
Hold it, hold it, hold it, hold it.

18:49.527 --> 18:51.862
George Jefferson? Yeah.

18:51.930 --> 18:54.932
You mean, next door George Jefferson? Yeah.

18:54.999 --> 18:57.334
You mean, colored George Jefferson?

18:57.401 --> 18:59.970
Right, Louise offered me a job

19:00.038 --> 19:03.573
in their cleanin' store
and I start tomorrow.

19:03.641 --> 19:07.677
Oh, wrong, Edith. You quit tonight.

19:07.746 --> 19:11.014
Archie, it's like the
answer to all our prayers.

19:11.082 --> 19:14.351
Hold it, Edith. I don't
pray to George Jefferson.

19:14.418 --> 19:16.620
And you ain't gonna work for him.
But Archie--

19:16.688 --> 19:20.057
oh, no, no, Edith. What the
hell's goin' on around here?

19:20.125 --> 19:21.792
You gettin' a job in a colored store,

19:21.859 --> 19:23.294
you bring me home a kosher cake.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.900
The next thing you'll have
me sittin' at the table

19:29.968 --> 19:32.169
with a yamaha on my head.

19:34.505 --> 19:36.206
I just wanna help,

19:36.274 --> 19:38.508
and they need somebody in the store.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.310
No, they don't need nobody at all.

19:40.378 --> 19:43.013
They're just tellin' you that
. Don't you see what their game is?

19:43.081 --> 19:45.749
They're just tryin' to be
friendly and drive me nuts. Oh.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.518
No, no, Edith. No, that's a handout.

19:48.587 --> 19:50.520
That's all I call that, a handout.

19:51.589 --> 19:52.556
Archie,

19:53.358 --> 19:55.359
if I don't take this job,

19:55.427 --> 19:58.195
we'll have to go on welfare.

19:58.262 --> 19:59.996
Use food stamps.

20:03.802 --> 20:05.235
What would you call that?

20:07.872 --> 20:09.539
Yeah, Edith, but--

20:09.607 --> 20:12.275
[stammering] But, I mean, Edith,

20:12.343 --> 20:14.177
what are the neighbors gonna say?

20:14.245 --> 20:15.778
I--I mean the white neighbors?

20:15.846 --> 20:18.781
Like the mcnabbs and--and--and the hefners?

20:18.849 --> 20:20.050
And the munsons?

20:20.118 --> 20:23.453
I mean, y-y-you workin'
in a colored store there,

20:23.521 --> 20:24.888
what they gonna say?

20:26.891 --> 20:29.626
I guess, they'll just say, "hi, Edith."

20:31.229 --> 20:32.329
[Footsteps]

20:32.397 --> 20:34.231
Oh, hi, ma.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.800
Gee, I'm sorry you had a lousy day.

20:36.868 --> 20:40.170
Oh, no, I didn't. I had a wonderful day.

20:43.908 --> 20:46.442
"Happy bar mitzvah, Irving."

20:47.344 --> 20:48.812
Who's Irving?

20:50.848 --> 20:52.916
Some little Jewish kid
that's still hurtin'.

20:56.587 --> 20:59.156
Hey, everybody, I got some great news.

20:59.223 --> 21:01.525
Ooh, what is it, honey? What is it?

21:01.593 --> 21:02.792
We're having cake tonight.

21:04.795 --> 21:06.663
Tell us your news, Michael.

21:06.731 --> 21:08.698
Who's Irving?

21:08.766 --> 21:10.267
Your news, honey? Your news?

21:10.334 --> 21:11.834
Oh, yeah. Hey, I got a job!

21:12.003 --> 21:13.336
[Whooping] What?

21:13.404 --> 21:14.972
(Mike) Isn't that great? What?

21:15.039 --> 21:16.273
(Edith) So did I.

21:16.340 --> 21:17.975
What? (Mike and Gloria) Really? Where?

21:18.042 --> 21:19.909
(Archie) What? The
Jefferson's cleaning store.

21:19.977 --> 21:23.213
What, what, what is that I
heard the meathead say?

21:23.280 --> 21:24.314
I got a job.

21:24.382 --> 21:25.882
You got a job? Yeah.

21:25.950 --> 21:28.051
That's the greatest news I heard all year.

21:28.118 --> 21:31.287
Eh, Edith, we're saved. We're
saved by the Polish cavalry.

21:33.190 --> 21:35.225
Come on, over here, Edith, right now.

21:35.292 --> 21:37.227
And get yourself on this phone here.

21:37.294 --> 21:38.862
What for?

21:38.929 --> 21:40.930
You're gonna call up the jeffersons,
the number is right here,

21:40.998 --> 21:43.867
and you're gonna tell George
Jefferson that you resign as of now.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.570
But Archie, I wanna work.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.005
Yeah, why does she have to quit her job?

21:49.073 --> 21:52.642
Because, didn't you hear? Your
husband, the meathead, has got a job.

21:52.710 --> 21:54.677
He's gotta be the breadwinner now.

21:54.746 --> 21:57.180
He's backin' me up, so you get
over here, Edith, and you dial.

22:05.289 --> 22:08.124
Ok, Edith, I got a finger, too. I can dial.

22:08.192 --> 22:09.660
Archie, please, don't.

22:09.727 --> 22:13.129
Oh, I can dial. I can... Go
back, back, back, back, back.

22:13.197 --> 22:14.898
I'll get the number,

22:14.965 --> 22:17.301
call the jeffersons and I'll say

22:17.368 --> 22:19.336
what has to be said myself.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.004
No-- that's all, that's all, that's all.

22:22.272 --> 22:23.640
Get over here, meathead.

22:24.809 --> 22:26.443
What kind of a Jo-- hold it, hold it.

22:26.511 --> 22:29.212
Uh, hi, there, Louise. Uh, Archie here.

22:29.280 --> 22:33.116
Uh, is George there? I wanna
talk to him for a minute.

22:33.184 --> 22:34.618
Yeah, thank you very much.

22:35.487 --> 22:37.087
I'll tell him.

22:37.154 --> 22:39.189
So, what kind of a Jo-- hold it, hold it.

22:39.256 --> 22:41.692
Hi, there, George. Uh, Archie here.

22:41.759 --> 22:43.360
I got a couple of things to tell you.

22:43.427 --> 22:45.395
Uh, first of all, my son-in-law, Michael,

22:45.463 --> 22:46.663
uh, he just got a job.

22:47.431 --> 22:49.432
Yeah. Yeah.

22:49.501 --> 22:51.668
Hold it. What kind of a job was that?

22:51.736 --> 22:52.869
Tutoring a kid in history.

22:52.937 --> 22:54.671
Hey! Hey, you hear that?

22:54.738 --> 22:56.072
Tutoring a kid in history.

22:56.140 --> 22:58.541
Brainwork, probably pays him a fortune.

22:58.609 --> 23:00.543
Yeah, how much you gonna make a week?

23:00.611 --> 23:02.445
Uh, about $20-$25 a week.

23:02.513 --> 23:03.847
The kid's gonna make...

23:11.322 --> 23:13.190
Uh,

23:13.257 --> 23:16.459
