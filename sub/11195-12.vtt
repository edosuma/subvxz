00:16.892 --> 00:20.395
Teal'c was ordered to push
the envelope, sir. He'll be back soon.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.482
Well, that'd be nice.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.360
Where else would he go?

00:26.485 --> 00:29.238
Good point.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.334
Well... Here we go.

01:03.564 --> 01:06.483
- Is there a problem, Colonel?
- No, sir. Not at all.

01:06.567 --> 01:10.863
I'm sure Teal'c just felt he'd take her
for a spin... around the world.

01:10.988 --> 01:14.074
While we wait, I have someone
who'd like to meet your team.

01:14.157 --> 01:17.828
Colonel Jack O'Neill, Major Samantha
Carter, Dr Daniel Jackson,...

01:17.911 --> 01:20.747
..allow me to introduce
Lieutenant General Vidrine.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.040
Colonel.

01:22.165 --> 01:22.916
Major.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.793
Doctor.

01:25.294 --> 01:27.421
General Hammond
has told me good things.

01:27.504 --> 01:30.674
Has he, sir? Well then,
I'm sure he's left something out.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.260
Such as?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.387
(distant engines rumbling)

01:36.680 --> 01:41.143
- Teal'c? You there, buddy?
- Look immediately to the southwest.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.778
(O'Neill) Whoo-hoo-hoo!

01:56.950 --> 02:01.914
- What in God's name is that?
- That, General, is the X301 lntercept.

02:03.624 --> 02:06.877
Lookin' good, Teal'c.
Give us another flyby, low and slow.

02:07.336 --> 02:09.795
As you wish.

02:14.134 --> 02:17.304
It's a hybrid, sir.
A combination of American know-how...

02:17.429 --> 02:20.933
..and two Goa'uld death gliders
that SG-1 recovered two years ago.

02:21.016 --> 02:24.686
It may be the most impressive
aircraft I've ever seen.

02:24.770 --> 02:27.689
It's more than that. Up till now
we haven't had a platform...

02:27.773 --> 02:30.651
..from which to launch an attack
against a Goa'uld ship.

02:30.734 --> 02:33.195
Now we do.

02:46.792 --> 02:50.295
- What makes it fly?
- That's difficult to explain, sir.

02:50.420 --> 02:55.050
The power plant doesn't exert force so
much as take inertia out of the equation.

02:55.175 --> 02:59.888
Pilots are immune to ordinary G-forces.
We don't completely understand...

02:59.972 --> 03:03.225
Major, I'll just accept the fact that it flies.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.894
Yes, sir.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.167
Oh, it flies. Yes, sir!

04:34.983 --> 04:38.570
I always like to get the view
of the man in the cockpit.

04:41.240 --> 04:44.993
- How does she fly, son?
- It was within expected parameters.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.162
Whoo-hoo!

04:48.997 --> 04:53.710
Sorry, sir. I couldn't help but get
caught up in Teal'c's enthusiasm.

04:54.753 --> 04:56.797
Upon completion of flight tests,...

04:56.922 --> 05:01.218
..we hope to deploy the X301 as an orbital
defence craft under your command, sir.

05:01.343 --> 05:03.470
In all seriousness,...

05:03.595 --> 05:06.431
..if that's all right with you, Colonel,...

05:06.515 --> 05:11.395
..how effective can a single fighter be
against a fleet of Goa'uld warships?

05:11.478 --> 05:16.525
- That is what these tests will determine.
- Let's find out. What's next?

05:16.650 --> 05:19.570
I take second seat
for an air-to-air live-fire test.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.656
Our SGC control room
will serve as mission control.

05:22.781 --> 05:25.617
- Light that candle, boys.
- Yes, sir.

05:30.038 --> 05:33.458
Does General Vidrine wish us
to perform a candle-burning ritual?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.669
Yes. That's it, exactly.

05:54.563 --> 05:57.357
(O'Neill)
Requestpermission for weapons test.

05:57.441 --> 05:59.234
You're go, Digger One.

06:01.445 --> 06:05.824
- (Teal'c) Proceeding to target area.
- (Carter) Copy. You're go forphase two.

06:08.285 --> 06:10.495
That's them?

06:10.579 --> 06:12.623
The X301 has Stealth technology.

06:12.748 --> 06:16.168
It wouldn't show up on radar,
so we've installed a transmitter.

06:16.251 --> 06:18.545
These blips represent the target drones.

06:18.629 --> 06:22.382
301 is carrying two AIM-120A
air-to-air missiles.

06:22.799 --> 06:27.930
Major, do you mean a Slammer missile
could take out a Goa'uld mother ship?

06:28.055 --> 06:32.351
If it has a naqahdah-enhanced warhead
and a shield-frequency modulator,...

06:32.434 --> 06:34.645
..yes, sir.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.571
Beginning attack run now.

06:51.828 --> 06:53.163
Oh! Whoo-hoo!

06:54.164 --> 06:56.917
Digger One, you're going to overshoot.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.259
Uh, Teal'c... Target's back that way.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.762
- I am no longer in control, O'Neill.
- Excuse me?

07:08.887 --> 07:13.183
The craft is not accepting input from
the controls. The drive is at full power.

07:15.769 --> 07:19.106
- Flight, we have an emergency.
- Ejectors have malfunctioned.

07:19.189 --> 07:24.069
We are no longer in control of the vehicle.
We have lost control and cannot eject.

07:24.152 --> 07:28.073
- Please advise.
- Digger One, Digger One, this is Flight.

07:29.032 --> 07:32.870
- They're not responding.
- There's atmospheric interference.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.580
Major Carter?

07:34.705 --> 07:40.210
The glider accelerated into a steep
vertical climb. It's off our radar.

07:40.294 --> 07:43.297
- We're trying to regain tracking.
- They've gone into orbit?

07:43.380 --> 07:47.301
- They're heading into space.
- The 301 is capable of space flight.

07:47.426 --> 07:49.469
Yes, sir, but that wasn't in the test.

07:49.595 --> 07:51.889
There has to be something wrong.

07:51.972 --> 07:56.268
A malfunction. Get me the shuttle
action officer at Space Command.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.688
The shuttle won't reach them, sir,
unless we can turn them around.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.273
It's all we've got.

08:01.356 --> 08:05.027
We've got NASA's Deep Space tracking
looking for the glider now.

08:05.152 --> 08:09.072
They should be able to get a hack on it
and restore communication.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.163
(O'Neill) Flight, this is Digger One.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.749
Cheyenne, we have a problem.

08:20.918 --> 08:23.378
Nothing's workin' back here.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.636
Uh, Teal'c...

08:30.761 --> 08:33.847
On our six, is that what I think it is?

08:33.972 --> 08:36.683
If you think it is Earth, yes.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.604
- It's shrinking.
- Its size remains constant.

08:40.687 --> 08:44.816
Rather, it is we who are moving away
at extreme velocity.

08:47.110 --> 08:49.863
These instruments
indicate drive shutdown.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.241
We are no longer accelerating.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.372
- That's good.
- I will attempt to restart.

08:59.748 --> 09:02.125
(distorted) Shol'va!

09:02.209 --> 09:05.629
To all those who would
turn against theirgod, know this.

09:05.754 --> 09:09.341
Foryourinsolence,
you will die in the cold ofspace.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.469
What was rightfully mine
will now return to me.

09:12.594 --> 09:17.808
Was that who I think it was?
And did he just say what I think he said?

09:17.933 --> 09:21.270
If you think it was Apophis
and that he said the original gliders...

09:21.395 --> 09:26.358
..contained a device designed to return
this glider to his home world... then yes.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.404
He also mentioned
something about... dying.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.782
- In the cold of space.
- Right.

09:37.578 --> 09:40.831
Well, the old boy hasn't
lost his touch, has he?

09:44.126 --> 09:46.587
Digger One, come in.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.964
Jack or Teal'c, please respond.

09:49.715 --> 09:53.802
- Nothing.
- NASA is trying to boost the signal.

09:53.886 --> 09:57.806
General, maybe we should contact
our allies capable of space flight.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.018
Proceed, Doctor.
SG-2 will stand by to assist.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.937
How fast is the glider going now?

10:04.062 --> 10:06.899
Roughly a million miles an hour,
give or take.

10:06.982 --> 10:09.693
At least they're no longer accelerating.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.947
George, maybe it would be best
if I returned to the Pentagon.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.910
See what our people can
contribute from that end.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.495
- You bring them home.
- Yes, sir.

10:22.372 --> 10:27.878
Sir, I have an idea, but a lot of things
have gotta go right in order for it to work.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.511
- (O'Neill) Cheyenne, we have a problem.
- Digger One, this is Flight.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.971
Reading you five by.

10:41.266 --> 10:43.894
- Why haven't they responded?
- We have to wait, sir.

10:43.977 --> 10:49.650
It's the time-lag, sir. The time for our radio
signal to travel to the X301 and back.

10:50.526 --> 10:53.070
How are we on consumables?

10:57.741 --> 11:02.037
We have sufficient power
and life support for several days.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.499
Several days. Well, that's somethin'.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.505
How long will this thing take
to get to wherever it's goin'?

11:11.630 --> 11:17.135
Assuming this device is programmed to
return to Apophis's original home world,...

11:17.219 --> 11:19.888
..several hundred years.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.724
- Several hundred?
- Years.

11:24.643 --> 11:27.187
Yeah, just, uh...

11:27.312 --> 11:29.523
Let me do the math on that here.

11:31.817 --> 11:34.111
Carry the four...

11:36.363 --> 11:41.159
The installation of this device was clearly
the result of my betrayal of Apophis.

11:41.285 --> 11:45.664
Before I became shol'va, such a device
would have been unnecessary.

11:46.540 --> 11:47.875
So?

11:47.958 --> 11:52.838
- I am indirectly responsible, O'Neill.
- Stop it. We'll be fine.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.674
(Daniel) Digger One, come in.

11:55.966 --> 11:59.219
- There. See?
- Jack or Teal'c, please respond.

12:00.554 --> 12:04.391
Flight, Digger One. We read you.
We have lost control of the craft...

12:04.474 --> 12:06.768
..to some sort of hidden recall device...

12:06.894 --> 12:12.566
..that apparently... the scum-sucking,
slimy, snake-ass Apophis...

12:12.691 --> 12:15.402
..installed in his death gliders. Over.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.529
(static)

12:19.948 --> 12:22.242
- Flight, do you copy?
- (static)

12:26.538 --> 12:30.918
Uh, Flight, I don't know whether or not
you can hear me, but,...

12:32.377 --> 12:35.172
..uh... controls are not responding.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.675
No thrusters and
no reaction-control system.

12:38.759 --> 12:42.012
We are... purely ballistic.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.811
Over.

12:50.103 --> 12:53.524
Colonel, you're so far out
there's a time-lag of a few minutes,...

12:53.649 --> 12:56.360
..so conversation is gonna be a problem.

12:56.443 --> 13:00.739
We've received some preliminary tracking
data from the Deep Space Network.

13:00.822 --> 13:04.326
The glider is going to pass
relatively close to Jupiter.

13:04.409 --> 13:07.830
We're hoping, if we can somehow
nudge your trajectory a bit,...

13:07.955 --> 13:11.291
..you can perform a slingshot manoeuvre
back toward Earth.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.127
Message ends 1430 Zulu.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.464
The time-lag. Good thinking, Major.

13:17.548 --> 13:22.094
It'll take at least three minutes for
our radio signals to get that far out.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.056
Flight, Digger One. We read you.
We have lost control ofthe craft...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.267
..to some sort ofhidden recall device...

13:28.392 --> 13:31.228
- ..that apparently...
- (interference)

13:31.311 --> 13:34.565
..Apophis installed
in his death gliders. Over.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.652
Flight, do you copy?

13:40.487 --> 13:44.867
Uh, Flight, I don't know whether ornot
you can hearme, but...

13:46.451 --> 13:49.204
Uh... Controls are not responding.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.001
No thrusters and
no reaction-control system.

13:54.084 --> 13:58.130
- We are... ballistic.
- Dammit!

13:58.672 --> 14:02.092
I was counting on them having
some ability to manoeuvre.

14:02.217 --> 14:07.431
I don't know how to swing them around
Jupiter without reaction-control systems.

14:11.185 --> 14:14.605
We're hoping, ifwe can somehow
nudge your trajectory a bit,...

14:14.688 --> 14:18.108
..you can perform a slingshot manoeuvre
back toward Earth.

14:18.192 --> 14:21.153
Message ends 1430 Zulu.

14:22.613 --> 14:25.782
Message understood at 1433 Zulu.

14:27.618 --> 14:30.162
- OK! How do we do that?
- Without thrusters,...

14:30.287 --> 14:32.664
..we are incapable of nudging.

14:33.499 --> 14:35.375
Right.

14:35.501 --> 14:42.466
Flight, this is Digger One.
We have negative... nudging capabilities.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.933
Stand by, Flight.

14:52.392 --> 14:56.688
Teal'c, the weapon system we installed
shouldn't be affected, right?

14:56.772 --> 14:59.775
- What are you considering, O'Neill?
- Our missiles.

14:59.858 --> 15:04.238
A great deal of thrust would be required
to significantly alter our trajectory.

15:04.363 --> 15:06.740
We just need a nudge.

15:07.449 --> 15:10.369
I am unsure of that specific measurement.

15:12.162 --> 15:17.835
Uh... Flight, Digger One. We've got two
AIM-120 Alpha rocket motors that may,...

15:17.960 --> 15:20.629
..l'll say again, may be at our disposal.

15:21.338 --> 15:26.969
Uh... Flight, Digger One. We've got two
AIM-120 Alpha rocket motors that may,...

15:27.052 --> 15:30.222
..l'll say again, may be at our disposal.

15:30.389 --> 15:35.185
Can we override the release mechanism
and keep them attached through burnout?

15:35.269 --> 15:39.731
Ifso, we'll need to calculate
where, when, and duration ofburn.

15:39.857 --> 15:42.401
Digger One at 1458 Zulu.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.696
Major Davis?

15:45.821 --> 15:48.824
- They wanna cook off the missiles, sir.
- What for?

15:48.907 --> 15:52.828
If we get enough delta v out of the
rocket motors, our plan might still work.

15:52.953 --> 15:56.456
- Can you do an override procedure?
- Yes, that's the easy part.

15:56.582 --> 16:01.211
Talk them through it. I'll need half an hour
to make the burn calculations, sir.

16:01.336 --> 16:04.339
Major, don't get me wrong,
but the margin for error...

16:04.464 --> 16:07.301
- That's the time we've got.
- I realise that.

16:07.384 --> 16:11.555
- They thrust wrong, they hit Jupiter.
- Wait any longer and we're too late.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.099
- Sir?
- Do it.

16:19.354 --> 16:22.608
(Davis) OK, missile selection switch
to AIM-120A.

16:22.691 --> 16:25.611
- Air-to-airradarmode to BORE.
- Slow down.

16:25.694 --> 16:27.738
You'll see an "out ofrange" message.

16:27.863 --> 16:32.910
Enter "update" and load the fiigures
I read you to override the fiiring inhibitors.

16:32.993 --> 16:37.456
- Teal'c, you gettin' all this?
- At thatpoint you will get a tone.

16:37.539 --> 16:41.793
(Carter) Fire missile two,
followed by missile one at Tplus 10.

16:41.877 --> 16:44.755
This sounds like a lot, guys,
but it's what we have to do.

16:44.838 --> 16:48.759
You can commence at anypoint
from 1622 Zulu.

16:48.842 --> 16:51.553
This is Flight - 1618 Zulu.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.515
That's right about now.

16:54.598 --> 16:56.975
Whenever you're ready.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.771
Air-to-air mode: BORE.

17:02.481 --> 17:04.691
- Update.
- Update.

17:07.402 --> 17:08.654
Ready.

17:08.779 --> 17:12.991
Flight, this is Digger One. We copy
updates and we're ready to begin burn.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.618
Selecting... missile two.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.540
And...

17:23.836 --> 17:27.089
Four... three... two... one.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.024
Weapons are releasing.

17:50.654 --> 17:51.655
Look out!

17:54.491 --> 17:57.286
Preliminary data coming in.

18:14.511 --> 18:16.972
Digger One, this is Flight.

18:18.515 --> 18:20.726
We have no joy on the burn.

18:22.394 --> 18:26.857
I'm sorry, Colonel, but the missiles
just didn't have enough thrust.

18:26.982 --> 18:31.236
Your current trajectory takes you out of
the solar system towards the Oort cloud...

18:31.320 --> 18:33.614
..which you should reach in a...

18:34.364 --> 18:36.825
..in a few months.

18:37.618 --> 18:41.872
We're all still thinking down here,
so... don't give up.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.211
1813 Zulu.

18:59.348 --> 19:03.602
We're all still thinking down here,
so... don't give up.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.980
1813 Zulu.

19:12.528 --> 19:15.364
Cabin pressure's holding.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.908
We didn't spring a leak.

19:18.992 --> 19:21.370
Though I may have just... taken one.

19:21.453 --> 19:25.040
- Our situation has indeed worsened.
- You think?

19:26.166 --> 19:30.379
Indeed. Impact with the missile
has damaged both power and life support.

19:30.754 --> 19:35.050
I've always wanted to see the Oort cloud,
so there's that.

19:37.511 --> 19:40.514
Flight, this is Digger One.

19:40.597 --> 19:46.353
The failed burn caused damage to
our power systems... and life support.

19:46.937 --> 19:49.398
No propulsion and limited consumables.

19:49.481 --> 19:53.777
The attempt to change their course has
damaged life support and power systems.

19:53.861 --> 19:57.197
We recommend a complete shutdown
of all non-essential systems.

19:57.322 --> 20:01.493
Maybe they can disconnect whatever
locked them out in the first place.

20:01.577 --> 20:05.706
- It's worth considering.
- No, sir. I don't think it is.

20:05.789 --> 20:07.124
Why not?

20:07.207 --> 20:12.337
It's logical to assume there's a fail-safe
mechanism to prevent the pilot doing that.

20:12.462 --> 20:15.132
- We don't know that for a fact.
- It makes sense.

20:15.215 --> 20:19.469
At this point I recommend we concentrate
on ways to maximise life support.

20:19.553 --> 20:22.264
The designers of the X301
are running scenarios.

20:22.347 --> 20:27.561
They can scrub the CO2, but oxygen and
power are going to be a problem now.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.105
And it is going to get cold up there.

20:30.814 --> 20:31.982
Dr Jackson?

20:32.065 --> 20:36.862
The Tollan don't have a spacecraft fast
enough or close enough to get there.

20:36.987 --> 20:41.033
- And the Tok'ra?
- Um... I spoke with Anise personally.

20:41.116 --> 20:45.037
She said they have a scout ship
within a day or so of Earth, barely.

20:45.120 --> 20:47.915
But it's on a covert mission
to a Goa'uld-occupied world...

20:47.998 --> 20:52.377
..and the High Council doesn't want to
expose their operative by making contact.

20:52.503 --> 20:54.713
Then why would they tell you that much?

20:54.838 --> 21:00.302
They hope the operative will complete the
mission in time to help Jack and Teal'c.

21:00.385 --> 21:04.640
I assume Anise refused to say
where or what this covert mission was.

21:04.848 --> 21:10.437
And to understand not wanting to risk
the life of a Tok'ra important to both of us.

21:10.521 --> 21:12.814
I sort of... Iost my temper,...

21:12.898 --> 21:16.485
..but she said she was doing us a favour
by telling us as much as she did.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.570
Maybe she was.

21:19.905 --> 21:23.158
We know a scout ship's maximum speed
from our mission to Netu.

21:23.283 --> 21:27.371
We also know it's a Goa'uld-occupied
world relatively close to Earth, so...

21:27.454 --> 21:31.124
- So... that narrows it down.
- Yes, it does.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.253
- Sir, with your permission...
- Granted.

21:34.878 --> 21:37.089
Navigation off.

21:37.214 --> 21:39.842
Fire control systems off.

21:41.635 --> 21:44.096
Targeting computer... off.

21:46.723 --> 21:49.393
Illumination at minimum setting.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.237
Is that all we can shut down?

22:02.823 --> 22:05.284
The radio, O'Neill.

22:07.911 --> 22:10.205
Right.

22:16.211 --> 22:21.341
Flight, this is Digger One at 1952 Zulu.

22:23.635 --> 22:28.974
We have initiated power conservation
and will have to terminate the downlink.

22:29.892 --> 22:34.855
We'll reconfigure for a com pass
five minutes before and after every hour.

22:34.980 --> 22:40.110
(Daniel) This is Flight. We've got a plan to
try to reach you with a Tok'ra scout ship.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.613
Message ends at... what time is it?

22:45.282 --> 22:48.619
Uh... 1947 Zulu.

22:48.702 --> 22:52.831
Flight, Digger One.
We would prefer to do something.

22:52.915 --> 22:55.292
Tell us how to fix this,
we'll fly ourselves home.

22:55.417 --> 22:59.880
And ifyou're thinking oftrying
to disconnect the recall device,...

23:00.005 --> 23:03.342
..Sam thinks that wouldjust
make things worse.

23:10.807 --> 23:13.352
This is P2C-257.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.562
It is the only Goa'uld-occupied world...

23:15.687 --> 23:19.608
..that's remotely within a scout ship's
range of Earth at maximum speed.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.110
The Tok'ra operative must be there.

23:22.194 --> 23:25.948
- What are the risks?
- Well, SG-14 spent several days there...

23:26.031 --> 23:28.325
..observing a Goa'uld mining operation.

23:28.408 --> 23:31.662
They got in and out
without being detected. So can we.

23:31.787 --> 23:34.540
There's still the matter of identifying
the Tok'ra operative.

23:34.623 --> 23:37.084
Anise said someone
important to both of us.

23:37.167 --> 23:41.171
- Someone we know.
- At least that's what we're hoping.

23:41.255 --> 23:44.508
We know what the risks are, sir,
and we're ready.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.845
I can see that. You have a go.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.972
Thank you, sir.

23:51.974 --> 23:55.060
Tell them to hang on, sir. We'll get there.

24:06.572 --> 24:08.615
Digger One, this is Hammond.

24:08.699 --> 24:13.328
DrJackson and Major Carterare
procuring a craft to rescue you,...

24:13.412 --> 24:17.332
..but you're going to have to
hang on foranother24 hours.

24:17.457 --> 24:20.002
I know that sounds like a long time,...

24:20.127 --> 24:23.881
..and I know you want to do something
to get yourselves out ofthis,...

24:23.964 --> 24:26.967
..but the best thing you can do
is conserve your energy.

24:27.092 --> 24:29.553
Hammond out at 2100.

24:34.474 --> 24:35.934
24 hours.

24:36.018 --> 24:39.605
Our current power and life support
will not last 12 hours.

24:41.899 --> 24:44.359
Let me do the math.

25:28.278 --> 25:31.365
We may have to go into the mine.

25:31.448 --> 25:35.035
What about contacting
the operative by radio?

25:35.160 --> 25:37.204
(branches crack)

26:02.145 --> 26:06.316
Are you out of your minds?
What the hell are you two doing here?

26:07.317 --> 26:10.487
- We were looking for you.
- You'd better have a damn good reason!

26:10.612 --> 26:14.825
I was 20 minutes away from detonating
a weapons-grade shipment of naqahdah...

26:14.908 --> 26:19.204
..that would have vaporised
a sizeable chunk of this planet!

26:19.329 --> 26:21.707
If I hadn't seen you
coming through the Stargate...

26:21.832 --> 26:24.376
- You saw us?
- Yes. The ship was cloaked.

26:24.501 --> 26:28.255
"Was" being the operative word.
Now they know we're here.

26:28.338 --> 26:31.508
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c need your help.

26:33.468 --> 26:34.970
What happened?

26:35.053 --> 26:37.514
They're in a disabled glider
headed into deep space.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.142
This was the only ship within range.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.812
Good enough.

26:45.522 --> 26:47.566
Let's go.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.158
What is it, Major?

26:59.286 --> 27:00.537
General...

27:00.621 --> 27:04.124
Sir, Major Carter and Dr Jackson
are now aboard a Tok'ra scout ship...

27:04.249 --> 27:07.336
..piloted by her father.
We're designating it Digger Two.

27:07.419 --> 27:10.088
I call that good news, Major.
What's the problem?

27:10.172 --> 27:13.509
We only received
the one coded message, sir,...

27:13.634 --> 27:17.304
..before they made the jump into
hyperspace. By my calculations,...

27:17.429 --> 27:20.265
..even at the scout ship's top speed,...

27:21.266 --> 27:25.729
..Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c
will be dead by the time they arrive.

27:43.831 --> 27:46.208
What do you say we turn up the heat?

27:47.251 --> 27:50.128
We must conserve
as much power as possible.

27:50.963 --> 27:53.090
By the way, I've done the math.

27:54.383 --> 27:56.593
As have l.

27:56.718 --> 28:00.848
So what do you say we turn up the heat?
It's cold in here.

28:00.931 --> 28:03.559
I am aware.

28:03.642 --> 28:07.896
You know, I've already done
that freezing-to-death thing,...

28:08.939 --> 28:12.109
..and it's just not as enjoyable
as it sounds.

28:13.735 --> 28:16.196
So if we just consider there's no chance...

28:16.321 --> 28:18.866
- There is a chance, O'Neill.
- 24 minus 12...

28:18.991 --> 28:22.828
If I place myself in an extremely
deep state of kelno'reem,...

28:22.953 --> 28:25.080
..my heart rate will decrease...

28:25.205 --> 28:29.126
..and our oxygen requirement
will be lowered considerably.

28:33.088 --> 28:35.382
Who will I talk to?

28:36.175 --> 28:39.094
There is little to say, O'Neill.

28:39.178 --> 28:42.347
We have fought and won
many battles together.

28:43.056 --> 28:46.643
It has been an honour
to serve the Tauri by your side.

28:48.228 --> 28:50.689
We are brothers.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.778
Wow. That's, uh...

28:58.405 --> 29:01.408
Is there anything you wish to say, O'Neill?

29:01.533 --> 29:04.369
What could I possibly say after that?

29:06.246 --> 29:08.624
Back at ya.

29:09.416 --> 29:12.085
If we are to die,...

29:12.169 --> 29:14.630
..we die well.

29:23.472 --> 29:25.933
We could do better.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.782
- Vibration.
- No kidding.

29:41.865 --> 29:44.827
We're at 132%%% of maximum speed.

29:45.494 --> 29:49.081
If we don't shake apart first,
we might just get there.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.794
- Is that wise?
- No.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.128
Oh.

29:58.006 --> 30:00.801
(distorted) You did not know
of the recall mechanism?

30:00.884 --> 30:05.514
Apophis didn't need one until Teal'c
planted the seeds of rebellion on Chulak.

30:05.639 --> 30:09.643
- We didn't have a clue.
- The devices are new, even to the Tok'ra.

30:09.726 --> 30:11.854
You could have told us.

30:11.979 --> 30:14.690
You could have told us of your intentions.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.901
Uh, yes. Why didn't we?

30:18.026 --> 30:21.363
(undistorted) Same reason we didn't.
Politics.

30:21.446 --> 30:24.116
So how do you intend to get 'em
out of the glider?

30:24.199 --> 30:26.660
There's no chance
it'll fit into the cargo bay.

30:26.785 --> 30:31.415
Well, we were kinda hoping
that you could, like, beam them out.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.793
Beam them out. What am I - Scotty?

30:39.006 --> 30:44.386
I have an idea, Dad, but Colonel O'Neill
and Teal'c will have to take a leap of faith.

31:10.204 --> 31:14.500
This is Digger One - 101 1 Zulu.

31:17.961 --> 31:21.131
Teal'c's meditating to conserve oxygen.

31:23.383 --> 31:27.054
I'm trying to sleep, but it's hard.

31:32.226 --> 31:34.686
CO2 levels are high.

31:36.063 --> 31:38.524
Headache.

31:40.526 --> 31:43.070
It's bad.

31:45.656 --> 31:48.116
Send aspirin.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.872
I estimate three hours.

31:59.753 --> 32:02.214
This is Digger One.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.147
(engine slows)

32:20.858 --> 32:23.694
- What's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong.

32:23.777 --> 32:26.572
- Not yet.
- But there will be something wrong?

32:26.655 --> 32:29.116
Well, I'd like to stop
and make some repairs,...

32:29.241 --> 32:33.287
..but this isn't a particularly
safe part of town to pull over.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.247
Oh.

32:35.664 --> 32:38.542
What were you thinking?
Retrofitting a death glider.

32:38.625 --> 32:43.589
You should have known better.
The technology is way over your head.

32:43.714 --> 32:47.801
That's the most arrogant... I can't believe
that just came out of your mouth.

32:47.885 --> 32:50.637
- It's the truth.
- You of all people should know...

32:50.721 --> 32:55.100
I am uniquely qualified to know just how
technologically infantile humans are.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.059
Infantile.

32:56.143 --> 32:59.646
Yes. In comparison with the Goa'uld
and Tok'ra, you're very young.

32:59.771 --> 33:02.232
- You are so...
- There's nothing wrong with that.

33:02.357 --> 33:07.488
But you gotta learn. You can't just slap
a US Air Force sticker on a death glider...

33:07.571 --> 33:10.908
..and call it yours. Advancement
like that has to be earned.

33:10.991 --> 33:16.830
Aren't the Goa'uld and the Tok'ra
where they are by stealing technology?

33:16.955 --> 33:19.791
- Yes.
- But we were flying in ships like this...

33:19.875 --> 33:24.254
..when most of the people on Earth
still thought it was flat.

33:25.172 --> 33:28.008
- What's that?
- Just what I was afraid of.

33:28.091 --> 33:30.636
We've overtaxed the drives.

33:36.099 --> 33:39.937
- (computer) Proximity alert.
- Still a bad part of town.

33:40.020 --> 33:45.359
The worst. We can probably get the drives
back on line, but it'll take a few minutes.

33:46.443 --> 33:49.196
Excuse me. Is that what I think it is?

34:05.337 --> 34:09.882
- Can we cloak the ship?
- No. All main power systems are off line.

34:11.635 --> 34:15.556
- Can you speak with the Goa'uld dialect?
- Uh... The dialect, yes.

34:15.681 --> 34:20.726
That's all you need. When they try to
make contact, place your hand here...

34:20.811 --> 34:23.188
..and just use your imagination.

34:23.313 --> 34:26.650
Take your hand away
and it will broadcast.

34:27.067 --> 34:29.360
Sam, can you give me a hand?

34:44.251 --> 34:47.670
I'm trying to sleep, but it's hard.

34:49.422 --> 34:51.717
CO2 levels are high.

34:52.592 --> 34:55.387
Headache. It's bad.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.850
Send aspirin.

34:59.933 --> 35:02.394
I estimate three hours.

35:04.271 --> 35:06.732
This is Digger One.

35:08.942 --> 35:11.403
Shall I respond, sir?

35:12.988 --> 35:15.824
Do we have any new
information to pass on?

35:16.617 --> 35:21.330
No, sir. Not since Major Carter reported
they boarded the scout ship.

35:23.457 --> 35:25.751
Let the man try to sleep.

35:26.835 --> 35:28.795
Yes, sir.

35:32.299 --> 35:34.968
Kree tal shal mak! Heru-ur!

35:37.095 --> 35:40.265
Mak tal shree! Lok tak!

35:41.558 --> 35:44.019
Mekta satak Oz.

35:45.562 --> 35:48.732
(Goa'uld voice) Mak tal shree! Lok tak!

35:49.858 --> 35:52.486
Mekta satak Oz.

35:53.612 --> 35:55.906
Mak tal Oz?

35:56.865 --> 35:59.243
Mak tal Oz, kree!

36:00.410 --> 36:03.205
(Goa'uld voice) Mak tal Oz, kree!

36:05.624 --> 36:07.334
Kal tak, shree! Tel manak.

36:07.459 --> 36:12.589
- All right. Sam's just finishing.
- That's good, cos they didn't buy my act.

36:12.714 --> 36:17.177
- Why? Who'd you say you were?
- The, uh... great and powerful Oz.

36:19.221 --> 36:21.598
- Sam!
- Almost there!

36:25.602 --> 36:28.063
We gotta go!

36:28.188 --> 36:30.482
Punch it!

36:38.657 --> 36:41.118
It's been almost three hours.

36:41.243 --> 36:44.580
I'd like to send a final message
to Colonel O'Neill.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.500
Yes, sir.

36:48.584 --> 36:52.963
(Carter) Flight, Digger Two. We are in the
solarsystem andpreparing forretrieval.

36:53.046 --> 36:56.300
Our time to station-keep
with Digger One is fourminutes.

36:56.383 --> 36:58.677
Stand by.

37:01.305 --> 37:05.767
We're trying to contact Digger One, sir.
So far without success.

37:17.988 --> 37:21.074
Digger One, this is Carter. Do you read?

37:24.912 --> 37:28.081
- Are we too late?
- I think they're unconscious.

37:28.207 --> 37:30.918
(Daniel) Well, we have to
wake them up somehow.

37:33.212 --> 37:38.008
Dammit, Colonel! We haven't come all this
way to take you home in a box. Wake up!

37:40.844 --> 37:43.305
Let me give them a nudge.

37:58.695 --> 38:00.989
(Carter) Colonel O'Neill!

38:05.911 --> 38:08.205
Carter?

38:11.375 --> 38:14.044
- Carter!
- Yes, sir.

38:16.129 --> 38:18.757
- Hi.
- Hi, sir.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.386
We're gonna find a way to get you
back home, safe and warm.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.763
What's your reserve oxygen status?

38:25.055 --> 38:26.640
Uh...

38:26.723 --> 38:29.268
I don't know... What?

38:30.435 --> 38:33.438
What's your reserve oxygen status?

38:35.399 --> 38:36.984
Carter, is that you?

38:37.067 --> 38:42.406
Sir, we're over here ready to bring you
home, but you're gonna have to trust me.

38:44.867 --> 38:48.787
They're suffering from anoxia -
oxygen deprivation.

38:48.912 --> 38:51.373
Do you trust me, sir?

38:53.000 --> 38:56.587
- Sure.
- Good. Is Teal'c conscious?

38:58.338 --> 39:00.799
Teal'c?

39:03.218 --> 39:05.262
Teal'c!

39:07.306 --> 39:10.559
- O'Neill.
- Look! It's Carter.

39:11.894 --> 39:14.188
She wants to talk to you.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.609
Major Carter, little oxygen remains.

39:18.692 --> 39:20.986
Cabin pressure?

39:21.695 --> 39:24.156
- Also very low.
- We copy that.

39:24.239 --> 39:26.950
So we want you to do
exactly what we say.

39:27.367 --> 39:30.287
First, remove your restraints.

39:30.370 --> 39:34.291
Then, on my mark, blow the canopy
of the glider and push off.

39:34.416 --> 39:36.293
- We will die.
- Negative.

39:36.376 --> 39:38.670
You'll be all right for a few seconds.

39:38.795 --> 39:43.425
Teal'c, the only way we can bring you
aboard is with the ring transporter.

39:43.717 --> 39:46.595
That means you have to be
clear of the glider.

39:46.678 --> 39:49.848
- You got it?
- I understand.

39:49.932 --> 39:55.521
Good. I need you at least five metres
from the scout ship. Close together.

39:55.604 --> 39:57.898
Stand by until I get into position.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.400
Jacob, is that you?

40:00.526 --> 40:03.529
Yes, it is, Jack. Now do what we tell you.

40:04.488 --> 40:07.032
Do you know your ship's
bigger than ours?

40:07.115 --> 40:09.743
Colonel, we need you to concentrate.

40:15.916 --> 40:19.503
- Blow the canopy.
- On my mark, not before.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.589
Right.

40:22.714 --> 40:27.344
Make sure your helmets are secure
and set your oxygen at 100%%%.

40:28.095 --> 40:32.975
You'll need to pre-breathe the last of it.
Deep breaths, holding each one in.

40:33.225 --> 40:36.478
You need to power the system
before you blow the canopy.

40:36.562 --> 40:41.275
Then disconnect the umbilical
and exhale as much as possible.

40:41.358 --> 40:43.819
Stand by.

41:03.172 --> 41:05.924
We're in position. Stand by in the hold.

41:07.009 --> 41:09.386
Colonel, Teal'c, are you ready?

41:10.762 --> 41:13.056
Ready!

41:15.017 --> 41:18.353
Three... two... one...

41:18.770 --> 41:20.814
Mark!

41:55.057 --> 41:56.517
They're all right!

41:56.600 --> 42:00.812
Flight, this is Digger Two. We have
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c aboard.

42:00.896 --> 42:03.440
They're both alive.

42:06.902 --> 42:09.279
Welcome aboard.

42:16.829 --> 42:18.872
Jacob...

42:20.040 --> 42:24.211
- Thanks for stoppin' by.
- I was in the neighbourhood.

42:24.294 --> 42:26.672
You need a lift home?

42:26.797 --> 42:29.174
Yes, sir.

42:29.258 --> 42:31.301
Thank you.

42:42.813 --> 42:48.902
Flight, this is Digger Two. We have
Colonel O'Neill and Teal'c aboard.

42:49.027 --> 42:51.488
- They're both alive.
- Yes!

42:55.868 --> 43:00.038
Well done, Digger Two. Congratulations.
Now come on home.
