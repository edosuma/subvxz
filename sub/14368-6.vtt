01:02.103 --> 01:05.440
{\an5}BOY:
Congratulations
on your win, Ginger.

01:05.522 --> 01:07.150
{\an8}GIRL:
Awesome campaign!

01:07.233 --> 01:08.318
{\an8}BOY:
You rocked.

01:08.401 --> 01:08.818
{\an8}Thanks.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.695
{\an8}I just knew
you'd win

01:10.779 --> 01:11.821
the election,
Ginger.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.990
{\an1}Not one single person
fell asleep

01:14.073 --> 01:15.492
during your speech.

01:15.575 --> 01:17.160
Oh, and your
campaign slogan:

01:17.243 --> 01:19.162
"Persuasion,
not punishment"--

01:19.245 --> 01:21.831
{\an8}so powerful,
so moving!

01:21.915 --> 01:22.916
So many syllables.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.834
{\an1}Not that I'm entirely
sure what it means.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.503
Well, our school's
penal system

01:26.586 --> 01:28.004
is in desperate need
of a makeover, Dodie.

01:28.087 --> 01:31.508
Punishing students
the old-fashioned way

01:31.591 --> 01:32.133
just isn't working.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.052
In case you haven't noticed,

01:34.135 --> 01:37.055
it's always the same kids
in detention week after week.

01:37.138 --> 01:40.308
Two words for you,
Ginger: bad blood.

01:49.025 --> 01:53.530
{\an5}CARL:
So what's the 4-1-1
on Baby Elsa?

01:53.613 --> 01:55.365
{\an1}We rescued her
from starvation.

01:55.448 --> 01:57.200
{\an1}Last month's
red tide destroyed

01:57.283 --> 01:59.702
{\an1}most of the plankton
in Elsa's hood.

01:59.786 --> 02:00.495
So for the moment,

02:00.578 --> 02:02.622
{\an1}there's just not
enough to go around.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.166
I knew she'd love
the pirate ship.

02:06.876 --> 02:11.756
(<i> boys shouting in delight</i> )

02:12.215 --> 02:16.469
Carl, she's not the only
starving baby out there,

02:16.553 --> 02:18.596
just the only one
they found.

02:18.680 --> 02:21.432
Kills me too, Hoods.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.934
{\an1}Hey, remember
those plants I grew

02:23.017 --> 02:25.812
for <i> Bosley's Book of Bizarre</i>
<i>and Unbelievable World Records?</i>

02:25.895 --> 02:28.022
{\an1}Your underwater
vegetable garden.

02:28.106 --> 02:29.983
{\an1}You were disqualified
because they were inedible.

02:30.066 --> 02:34.571
They were only inedible
to humans, not to...

02:34.654 --> 02:39.409
(<i> sniffing</i> )

02:39.492 --> 02:42.245
(<i> sniffing</i> )

02:42.328 --> 02:43.788
I knew it.

02:43.872 --> 02:45.957
I can smell the sweet stench of
French milled soap a mile away.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.501
What are you doing here, Blake?

02:48.585 --> 02:50.545
Everyone's over
with the baby seals.

02:50.628 --> 02:55.008
Need I remind you, Carl,
this is a free country?

02:55.091 --> 02:56.467
I am simply exercising

02:56.551 --> 02:58.928
my right to stand
wherever I please

02:59.012 --> 03:00.930
and smell
however I like.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.265
But... as long as I'm here,

03:02.348 --> 03:05.768
I should love to join in
on the aforementioned plan.

03:05.852 --> 03:08.521
{\an4}What plan?
I haven't divulged
anything yet.

03:08.605 --> 03:10.106
Ah, but you will,

03:10.189 --> 03:13.401
because undoubtedly this scheme
will require funding--

03:13.484 --> 03:13.943
yours invariably do.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.278
{\an1}Not this time,
Blakesy.

03:15.361 --> 03:20.158
{\an4}So your overly
perfumed self
can just shove off.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.242
(<i> Hoodsey laughing</i> )

03:27.123 --> 03:29.876
Oh, I'm so chagrined!

03:29.959 --> 03:31.085
GINGER:
And under your supervision,

03:31.169 --> 03:36.215
the committee and I will enlist
volunteers from Lucky High

03:36.299 --> 03:39.260
to be brothers
rd d cky Junior.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.136
I must say, Ginger,
I'm impressed

03:40.219 --> 03:42.805
with how much thought
you've put into this.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.307
{\an1}I'm really looking
forward to it.

03:44.390 --> 03:47.644
Wow, I had no idea
you'd be so into my program.

03:47.727 --> 03:49.854
Not the program--

03:49.938 --> 03:51.898
the free time I'll be enjoying
because of it.

03:51.981 --> 03:53.316
I'll finally have time
to lower my handicap.

03:53.399 --> 03:56.819
(<i> sarcastically</i> ):
Gee, thanks for your support.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.073
PRINCIPAL:
Anytime.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.832
This seaweed-cauliflower hybrid

04:09.916 --> 04:11.292
{\an1}looks tasty,
don't you think?

04:11.376 --> 04:14.504
But Carl, whales
don't eat vegetables.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.046
They eat plankton.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.839
And what do plankton eat?

04:17.923 --> 04:18.757
Vegetables.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.301
But how will we get
the plants to the ocean?

04:20.385 --> 04:23.346
My mom won't let me
take the bus that far.

04:23.429 --> 04:25.848
Why do you continue
to doubt the master?

04:25.932 --> 04:26.933
{\an1}Thanks to
modern plumbing

04:27.016 --> 04:29.519
and our position
as a coastal state,

04:29.602 --> 04:31.604
the ocean is only a flush away!

04:31.688 --> 04:35.191
(<i> toilet flushes</i> )

04:35.274 --> 04:37.276
{\an1}Couldn't we have
done this at home?

04:37.360 --> 04:39.153
I mean, what if
we get caught?

04:39.237 --> 04:40.196
We need
more than one

04:40.279 --> 04:41.698
porcelain altar
to pull this off.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.950
{\an5}And we're not
getting caught,
so stop being paranoid.

04:44.033 --> 04:45.201
(<i> Carl snickers fiendishly</i> )

04:45.284 --> 04:49.288
I will be the envy
of every marine biologist

04:49.372 --> 04:52.875
who didn't come up with
this brilliant plan!

04:52.959 --> 04:54.836

05:01.843 --> 05:09.308
(<i> rumbling, banging</i> )

05:21.946 --> 05:23.239
MRS. GORDON:
Mr. Foutley!

05:23.322 --> 05:26.701
I should have known
you were behind this prank.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.911
It has your fingerprints
all over it.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.913
My fingerprints are
all over it, too.

05:30.997 --> 05:33.624
{\an5}Everyone knows you're
a gullible sidekick.

05:33.708 --> 05:34.542
{\an1}Am not!

05:34.625 --> 05:36.419
Color me innocent, Gordo.

05:36.502 --> 05:37.545
It wasn't a prank.

05:37.628 --> 05:39.881
It was an heroic gesture.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.341
{\an1}I didn't know the school
is on a septic system.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.886
Granted I should have done
a little more testing

05:44.969 --> 05:45.928
and found out
they explode in growth

05:46.012 --> 05:49.307
when they come in contact
with raw sewage, but...

05:49.390 --> 05:50.683
But nothing!

05:50.767 --> 05:54.228
Thanks to you, Mr. Foutley,
your plants clogged the toilets,

05:54.312 --> 05:55.188
our plumbing system is ruined

05:55.271 --> 05:58.816
and your poor classmates
are suffering

05:58.900 --> 06:00.777
an incredible amount
of discomfort.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.945
(<i> kids moaning</i> )

06:05.198 --> 06:06.115
<i>Fini.</i>

06:06.199 --> 06:07.533
Many thanks, Winston.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.951
You can take it away now.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.495
{\an5}MRS. GORDON:
Let me see, how can I
punish you?

06:10.578 --> 06:14.624
You've already washed my car
four times this month.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.001
I tried to create
an underwater farm

06:17.085 --> 06:18.336
to help feed the whales.

06:18.419 --> 06:22.256
That is the most ridiculous
excuse I've ever heard.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.508
I don't understand it.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.928
Your sister Ginger
was a model student.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.679
Well, just for the record,

06:28.763 --> 06:30.223
nobody gets punished
anymore Gordo.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.226
It's all about
the new persuasion method.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.646
{\an5}They're all over it
at the Junior High.

06:36.729 --> 06:41.859
{\an5}Instead of detention,
kids get big brothers
to boss them around.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.236
Oh?

06:43.319 --> 06:44.487
Well,
since ordinary

06:44.570 --> 06:48.199
disciplinary techniques
don't work with you,

06:48.282 --> 06:50.785
{\an5}I don't see why
we can't give
it a try.

06:50.868 --> 06:53.121
And I'll let the
Junior High do the work,

06:53.204 --> 06:55.498
since they already have
the program set up.

06:55.581 --> 06:59.418
A lot of them are former
students, you know,

06:59.502 --> 07:00.253
trained by me.

07:00.670 --> 07:04.924
{\an5}But Carl, now you're
going to get assigned
a big brother!

07:05.007 --> 07:09.512
And since my big sister
is doing the assigning,

07:09.595 --> 07:12.974
I'll be sure to get
a big pushover.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.393
Oh, Ginger, I've got
a new one for you.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.020
{\an5}Apparently your
program has
caught on

07:18.104 --> 07:20.356
at the
elementary school.

07:20.439 --> 07:23.818
{\an1}Oh, uh, just put it
on the stack, thanks.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.695
Elementary school?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.113
Carl?!

07:27.196 --> 07:31.200
{\an4}TAD:
Delete image,
Ginger.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.202
Meryl and I
will handle this one.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.163
{\an1}It'd be a conflict
of interest.

07:35.246 --> 07:35.830
He's your brother.

07:35.913 --> 07:37.748
I guess you
and Tad are right.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.417
But just because
he's my brother,

07:39.500 --> 07:42.503
don't think you have to
go extra easy on him.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.215
I knew you'd go easy on me.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.135
I recommended your
program to Gordo.

07:49.218 --> 07:50.678
You recommended it?

07:50.761 --> 07:51.804
Pretty clever, huh?

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
So thanks
in advance

07:52.805 --> 07:54.182
for saddling me
with someone easy, Sis.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.893
Carl, you blew up
the septic system.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.479
{\an1}You can't just skate through
life doing stuff like this

08:00.563 --> 08:01.522
{\an1}without ever taking
responsibility.

08:01.606 --> 08:05.401
Sure I can, and you can
make it happen for me.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.612
You're getting a big brother--

08:07.695 --> 08:08.738
the toughest one we have,

08:08.821 --> 08:10.781
{\an1}and I'm going to
see to it personally.

08:10.865 --> 08:12.241
Mom, Ginger's stepping
into your territory.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.203
Please tell her
<i>you're</i> the only one

08:15.286 --> 08:17.580
allowed to make
my life miserable.

08:17.663 --> 08:18.289
No can do, Carl.

08:18.372 --> 08:19.749
This is between
you two.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.042
And I'm not
telling Ginger

08:21.125 --> 08:22.460
{\an5}how to do
the job she was
elected to do.

08:22.543 --> 08:25.796
I'm lucky the school's
not charging me

08:25.880 --> 08:26.422
for your little stunt.

08:26.505 --> 08:33.929
Lois-- 12,431,
Carl-- 0.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.392
{\an5}GINGER:
And the whole reason
he recommended it to Mrs. Gordon

08:38.476 --> 08:41.812
{\an1}is because he figured
I'd go easy on him.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.524
{\an1}So I told Tad and Meryl
I would handle it.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.567
Even though
he's your brother?

08:46.651 --> 08:47.652
Brother or no brother,

08:47.735 --> 08:48.569
{\an1}he's like
any other lawbreaker

08:48.653 --> 08:51.697
{\an1}and I'll assign him
an appropriate guardian.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.990
Hmm...

08:53.074 --> 08:55.952
George Magrority.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.161
(<i> whistles</i> )

08:57.245 --> 08:58.955
Wow! A five-page resumé.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.083
Three years
in a military academy.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.501
This guy means business.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.630
If anybody can wipe
that smug look off Carl's face,

09:07.713 --> 09:11.175
it's going to be this guy.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.984
He's all yours, George.

09:28.734 --> 09:33.364
{\an1}I'm a model citizen
and my actions were noble.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.740
(<i> whistle blows</i> )

09:34.824 --> 09:35.533
Oh, don't worry.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.577
I'll break you of that delusion.

09:39.078 --> 09:43.332
{\an5}GEORGE:
And when my C.O. demanded
I drop and do 50,

09:43.416 --> 09:45.584
well, I did 60.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.836
Impressive.

09:46.919 --> 09:49.880
{\an5}And how long
were you at this
military academy?

09:49.964 --> 09:50.589
Long enough to turn me

09:50.673 --> 09:53.718
{\an1}into the guy
you see before you.

09:53.801 --> 09:55.011
That long, huh?

09:55.094 --> 09:56.137
(<i> blows whistle</i> )

09:56.220 --> 09:57.888
{\an1}Hey, that
sounded like

09:57.972 --> 10:00.016
{\an1}a smart remark,
little guy.

10:00.474 --> 10:02.768
{\an1}You know,
you should consider

10:02.852 --> 10:05.730
{\an1}enrolling Carl in Boy Scout
camp this summer, Lois.

10:05.813 --> 10:08.816
This just keeps getting
better and better.

10:08.899 --> 10:12.528
Say, Carl, why don't you ask
your mother how her day was.

10:12.611 --> 10:15.948
{\an5}Doesn't anyone
want to know how
<i>my</i> day was?

10:16.032 --> 10:18.701
Don't talk with
your mouth full.

10:18.784 --> 10:19.493
It's rude.

10:19.577 --> 10:22.496
Not to mention borderline gross.

10:24.165 --> 10:25.958
(<i> gulps</i> )

10:26.250 --> 10:29.754
Mom, how was <i> your</i> day?

10:29.837 --> 10:31.213
Not too bad, actually.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.758
I helped deliver twins,
assisted in two tonsillectomies

10:33.841 --> 10:36.385
and not a single kid
threw up on me all day.

10:36.469 --> 10:41.182
Anything else you'd
like to ask, Carl?

10:41.265 --> 10:41.599
Yeah.

10:41.682 --> 10:42.141
Can I be excused?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.477
Hold on there, cowboy.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.064
I believe Carl would like to
volunteer to clear the table.

10:48.147 --> 10:48.522
He would?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.107
It's my lucky day!

10:50.191 --> 10:52.777
(<i> laughing</i> )

10:54.570 --> 10:56.405
See you, Carl.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.574
Hey, don't get
dishpan hands.

10:58.657 --> 11:01.077
(<i> grumbling</i> )

11:03.829 --> 11:05.206
Haven't you ever
heard of knocking?

11:05.289 --> 11:07.458
Urgency overrules propriety.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.711
Listen, I'm going to
make a deal with you.

11:10.795 --> 11:12.004
You "86" George,

11:12.088 --> 11:14.757
and I'll give you an
all-access pass to my doghouse

11:14.840 --> 11:16.967
to be used any time
day or night

11:17.051 --> 11:18.260
with the exception of Tuesdays

11:18.344 --> 11:20.930
when there are top secret
operations going on.

11:21.013 --> 11:23.391
Sorry, no deals.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.351
Okay, okay, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

11:25.434 --> 11:28.062
but I'm willing to share custody

11:28.145 --> 11:29.730
{\an1}of my petrified
eyeball with you.

11:29.814 --> 11:33.317
Carl, I have to maintain
my campaign platform.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.237
And I'm not interested
in your old eyeball.

11:36.320 --> 11:39.115
Doesn't the word "pardon"
mean anything to you?

11:39.198 --> 11:41.951
This discussion is over.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.244
(<i> grunts angrily</i> )

11:43.327 --> 11:46.872
We'll see about that!

11:49.959 --> 11:50.918
{\an1}So do you
think George

11:51.001 --> 11:52.044
{\an1}is having a positive
influence on Carl yet?

11:52.128 --> 11:56.841
Well, it's a little early
in the program, don't you think?

11:56.924 --> 11:57.925
I just assigned
George yesterday.

11:58.008 --> 12:02.263
{\an1}Absolutely. And just because
Taylor cheated on her quiz

12:02.346 --> 12:03.931
to get June Royce
as a big sister

12:04.014 --> 12:06.392
{\an1}so she could get a discount
on a wardrobe

12:06.475 --> 12:08.853
{\an1}doesn't mean your program
isn't working.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.521
{\an1}I didn't hear
about that.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.106
{\an1}Then you probably
didn't hear

12:12.189 --> 12:13.149
{\an1}about C.C. refusing
to do homework

12:13.232 --> 12:16.694
so she'd get a big brother
who'd drive her to school

12:16.777 --> 12:18.654
{\an1}so she wouldn't have
to take the bus.

12:18.737 --> 12:24.827
Uh, no,
but thanks for the update.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.372
Glen, I'm not going
to assign you a big brother

12:28.456 --> 12:30.124
who will get you
into R-rated films.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.126
(<i> sighs</i> )

12:32.209 --> 12:34.420
Bribery won't work,
Carl.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.798
{\an1}I'm not calling
off George.

12:39.258 --> 12:41.093
I really didn't want
to go here but...

12:41.177 --> 12:43.762
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> )

12:44.263 --> 12:45.806
Where did you get those?!

12:45.890 --> 12:46.807
Give me that!

12:46.891 --> 12:49.560
I don't think so.

12:49.643 --> 12:51.312
You call off
the program

12:51.395 --> 12:53.022
or I will paper
the city

12:53.105 --> 12:56.984
{\an1}with your bare,
naked, baby butt.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.280
Go ahead, Carl.

13:01.363 --> 13:01.864
I'm a politician.

13:01.947 --> 13:02.698
It's only a matter
of time

13:02.781 --> 13:05.659
before my dirty laundry
hits the stands.

13:05.743 --> 13:06.869
{\an1}It will be humiliating
but it will pass.

13:06.952 --> 13:10.748
{\an1}You're the one who will
be tormented with the guilt

13:10.831 --> 13:14.168
{\an1}of blackmailing your own
flesh and blood.

13:14.460 --> 13:18.964
Okay, okay, no need
to get dramatic here.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.800
(<i> sighing</i> )

13:21.884 --> 13:22.343
Naked pictures.

13:22.426 --> 13:25.763
That was a close call.

13:26.764 --> 13:28.807
So what do
you think?

13:28.891 --> 13:30.100
Well, the junk may be gone

13:30.184 --> 13:34.021
{\an1}but the stench of my
rotting sandwich collection

13:34.104 --> 13:35.064
will never fade.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.566
This room deodorizer
should take care of it.

13:37.650 --> 13:42.071
You know, George,
this past week with you

13:42.154 --> 13:44.073
has been tough yet rewarding.

13:44.156 --> 13:47.368
And now that I've been persuaded
to mend my ways,

13:47.451 --> 13:49.161
{\an1}I want to thank you
for your time

13:49.245 --> 13:51.830
{\an1}and your relentless
instruction.

13:52.498 --> 13:56.043
{\an5}Nice try but we still
got a long road
ahead of us.

13:56.126 --> 13:56.585
(<i> whistle blowing</i> )

13:56.669 --> 13:57.670
See you tomorrow,
chief.

13:57.753 --> 14:03.676
Remember, good Carl's
in bed by 8:00.

14:08.806 --> 14:09.807
Come in, Hoods.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.308
We've got an emergency
on our hands.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.770
HOODSEY (<i> on transmitter</i> ):
Reporting for duty, Carl.

14:14.853 --> 14:16.397
{\an5}Your presence is requested ASAP.

14:16.480 --> 14:20.317
A certain redheaded person is
overdue for some major payback.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.443
This is not a test.

14:21.527 --> 14:25.948
Repeat: this is not a test.

14:28.200 --> 14:28.951
(<i> both gasp</i> )

14:32.580 --> 14:36.125
I thought you had
a suspicious gleam in your eye.

14:36.208 --> 14:39.128
Geez, I love being right
all the time.

14:39.211 --> 14:40.963
(<i> sighs</i> )

14:41.046 --> 14:43.007
{\an1}Since when do you
work overtime?

14:43.090 --> 14:44.758
{\an1}It's not like this
is a job.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.801
When I take on a project,

14:45.884 --> 14:49.680
I make it my life,
my mission, my quest.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.849
Well, it's all clear to me now.

14:51.932 --> 14:55.936
This doghouse is the route
of all your evil.

14:56.020 --> 15:01.275
After school tomorrow,
we'll start deconstructing it.

15:01.358 --> 15:01.942
{\an1}(<i> gasps</i> )

15:03.694 --> 15:05.154
Good night, Carl.

15:05.237 --> 15:09.074
Good night, wee-hooded one.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.121
Did he say...

15:14.204 --> 15:15.497
"Deconstruct?!"

15:14.204 --> 15:15.497
"Deconstruct?!"

15:15.581 --> 15:18.626
{\an4}And I didn't like
that "wee-hooded one"
crack, either.

15:18.709 --> 15:21.545
And now... now he wants
to demolish my doghouse--

15:21.629 --> 15:24.048
{\an1}the most sacred place
on Earth.

15:24.131 --> 15:27.509
You're blowing everything
way out of proportion.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.512
George probably wants you
to clean up a bit.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.306
Earth to Ginger!

15:32.389 --> 15:35.225
You were the one
who asked for this, Carl.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.852
Ah. I get it now.

15:36.935 --> 15:40.731
You're just sacrificing me
to your own ego.

15:40.814 --> 15:43.692
You want me to be
a living, breathing example

15:43.776 --> 15:46.153
of how well your
program's working.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.114
Newsflash! It's not working!

15:49.198 --> 15:50.741
It is too.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.242
{\an1}You know,
I could understand

15:52.326 --> 15:54.203
{\an1}if you wanted
to keep George around

15:54.286 --> 15:55.412
{\an1}because you think your plan
is working.

15:55.496 --> 16:01.710
{\an4}But to keep him around
to prove it isn't failing,
that's low.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.671
No, you know what?

16:03.754 --> 16:05.172
That's lower than low.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.341
{\an3}Well...

16:07.424 --> 16:10.427
You just refuse
to admit you did anything wrong!

16:17.184 --> 16:18.560

Oh, there she is.

16:18.644 --> 16:24.358
(<i> group actively conversing</i> )

16:24.441 --> 16:26.819
I plan on ditching gym
and getting caught

16:26.902 --> 16:27.903
so I'll be assigned
a big brother.

16:27.986 --> 16:30.989
Could you hook me up
with Mike Reddington--

16:31.073 --> 16:34.827
quarterback of the football team
and total hottie?

16:34.910 --> 16:37.121
Do I know you?

16:42.334 --> 16:44.586
Oh, Ginger, in case
anyone else tries

16:44.670 --> 16:45.671
to take credit
for it,

16:45.754 --> 16:47.798
I'm the one who
let the air out

16:47.881 --> 16:48.882
of Milty's tires.

16:48.966 --> 16:50.759
I'd like Jessica Turner
as a big sister.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.846
{\an1}She's the most popular girl
and it would do wonders

16:53.929 --> 16:57.015
for my reputation
to be seen with her.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.102
You know,
I've never done anything bad

17:00.185 --> 17:05.315
in my entire life until today
and it feels great.

17:05.398 --> 17:06.023

The Ginger Foutley Persuasion-
Not-Punishment Program

17:17.453 --> 17:20.289
is a total bust.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.391
We're desperately bored.

This program of yours
has left me with nothing to do,

no one to punish,
no one to humiliate.

my program's not working.

Really.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.366
Oh, well, then
as principal

17:56.450 --> 17:59.036
I have no choice
but to end it.

17:59.119 --> 18:02.039
I need my job back
but I'm proud of you, Ginger,

18:02.122 --> 18:03.999
for giving it
the old junior high try

18:04.082 --> 18:07.169
and it takes guts
to admit you're wrong.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.212
{\an1}Thanks.

18:08.295 --> 18:11.256
You'll take the fall
for this alone.

going, Carl?

Desperate times,
desperate measures.

18:29.775 --> 18:32.027
{\an1}We're leaving early
so we can ditch George.

18:32.110 --> 18:33.362
By the time he
figures it out,

18:33.445 --> 18:36.281
we'll have all the stuff
in the doghouse hidden.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.075
But how do
we sneak out?

18:38.158 --> 18:42.287
There are hall monitors
at all the doors.

his ugly head.

Don't worry,

19:09.231 --> 19:11.275
I'm not going to
give up on you

even if it takes the
rest of the year.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.571
Now, come on!

19:15.654 --> 19:17.573
Let's go tackle that doghouse.

19:17.656 --> 19:21.368
Not by the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.870
It's up to you

19:22.953 --> 19:26.039
but personally I wouldn't think
of embarrassing my sister!

19:26.123 --> 19:30.502
{\an5}Although given the
way her program's
been working out,

19:30.586 --> 19:35.299
{\an5}she's doing a pretty
good job of that
all by herself.

19:36.842 --> 19:39.261
Don't listen
to him, Carl.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.138
He's playing
the sister card,

trying to make you
feel guilty.

to get back at her just
yesterday, remember?

than payback.

on me.

when you feel the urge

{\an4}to cause trouble,
"What would me,
George Magrority, do?"

20:34.066 --> 20:36.360

I'd clean up my syntax

I'm not you, George Magrority.

{\an1}Take a big whiff,
Hoodsey.

21:09.267 --> 21:12.437
{\an1}Good, old-fashioned punishment
never smelled so sweet.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.856
{\an3}I know.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.859
{\an5}Did they seriously think
we wouldn't enjoy
cleaning up this muck?

21:17.943 --> 21:21.196
{\an1}Enjoy it because tomorrow
we're clapping erasers

21:21.279 --> 21:22.656
for ditching school early.

21:22.739 --> 21:26.451
(<i> boys laughing mischievously</i> )

21:29.454 --> 21:31.748
(<i> sighing sadly</i> )

21:31.832 --> 21:34.626
Hey, kid, you should
be proud of yourself.

21:34.710 --> 21:36.545
Why?

21:36.628 --> 21:37.587
I bailed on my program.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.381
Oh, you tried.

21:39.464 --> 21:41.008
That's what's
important.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.969
I guess so
but I still acted like a jerk

21:44.052 --> 21:44.636
when it came to Carl.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.555
Don't worry,
toots.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.724
Something tells me
he'll get over it.

21:48.807 --> 21:49.599
(<i> sniffing</i> )

21:50.225 --> 21:53.979
Oh, you're taking
a bath tonight, Carl.

21:54.062 --> 21:55.355
No discussion.

21:55.439 --> 22:00.444
Carl, Dodie told me something
that Hoodsey told her.

22:00.527 --> 22:01.653
Which was?

22:01.737 --> 22:04.031
Were you letting George
destroy your doghouse

22:04.114 --> 22:05.782
to support my program?

22:05.866 --> 22:07.159
Affirmative.

22:07.242 --> 22:08.118
{\an1}Wow.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.870
{\an1}And I wouldn't
cut you <i> any</i> slack.

22:09.953 --> 22:14.916
{\an5}Even though I blew up
the plumbing system
for noble reasons,

22:15.000 --> 22:16.418
well,
I did blow it up

22:16.501 --> 22:18.170
and I figured
if I started out

22:18.253 --> 22:21.757
with good intentions,
you probably did too.

22:21.840 --> 22:22.632
Great minds
think alike.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.260
Well, my intentions
might have been good

22:25.343 --> 22:28.055
{\an1}but my program
was a bad idea from the start.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.057
{\an1}No, there's no such thing
as a bad idea.

22:30.140 --> 22:33.143
Trust me, Sis,
all ideas are good.

22:33.226 --> 22:36.772
{\an1}Carl, I'm really sorry
about George.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.107
{\an1}He was a total
walking nightmare.

22:39.191 --> 22:41.610
{\an1}LOIS:
You can say that again!
