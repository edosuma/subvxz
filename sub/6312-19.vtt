WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:03.594
No, Mom, I didn't unfriend you.

00:03.630 --> 00:05.222
I deactivated my account.

00:05.270 --> 00:06.737
I unfriended everyone.

00:06.770 --> 00:08.692
It felt great.

00:08.740 --> 00:12.176
Because I've seen
all of the baby pictures

00:12.210 --> 00:14.235
and hashtag activism
and cat GIFs

00:14.280 --> 00:15.599
that I ever need to see.

00:15.640 --> 00:16.743
I'm good.

00:16.780 --> 00:19.271
I'm out.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.571
What?

00:20.620 --> 00:22.747
No.

00:22.790 --> 00:26.157
Sorry, it's just I could've
sworn I closed that.

00:27.560 --> 00:28.709
Nothing.

00:28.760 --> 00:31.228
I think I'm just
getting old like you.

00:31.260 --> 00:33.057
Yeah, okay.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.819
When you start talking Mandarin,
I know it's time to hang up.

00:35.860 --> 00:38.067
Bye.

00:42.270 --> 00:44.534
No.

00:44.570 --> 00:47.209
No way.

00:47.240 --> 00:48.434
(line rings)

00:48.480 --> 00:49.708
SOFIA (recorded):
This is Sofia.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.706
Leave me a message
and I'll call you back.

00:51.750 --> 00:52.739
It's me.

00:52.780 --> 00:54.441
Listen, something's wrong.

00:54.480 --> 00:55.845
Ifound...

00:55.880 --> 00:57.484
(silenced gunshots, screaming)

00:59.690 --> 01:01.783
(Watson groans)

01:01.820 --> 01:03.321
The smell in the kitchen
nearly knocked me out.

01:03.360 --> 01:04.827
What do you got cooking
in those pots?

01:04.860 --> 01:06.452
Oh, this and that--
black licorice,

01:06.500 --> 01:08.752
an old belt,
splash of feline urine.

01:08.800 --> 01:11.223
Okay, so we're gonna
have to get new pots,

01:11.270 --> 01:13.397
and I have to get my coffee
someplace else today.

01:13.440 --> 01:15.465
The National Council
of Sommeliers

01:15.500 --> 01:16.865
is embroiled in scandal.

01:18.410 --> 01:20.173
three American sommeliers
have authenticated

01:20.210 --> 01:21.575
cases of auction wine,

01:21.610 --> 01:23.578
which were later proven
to be forgeries.

01:23.610 --> 01:25.703
They didn't realize
they were drinking cat pee?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.718
You jest, but that is
an identifiable aroma

01:27.750 --> 01:29.308
in certain Sauvignon Blancs.

01:29.350 --> 01:30.840
I've been asked to learn
whether or not

01:30.890 --> 01:32.653
these so-called experts

01:32.690 --> 01:34.351
made honest mistakes
or whether they were

01:34.390 --> 01:35.857
paid to vouch
for fake booze.

01:35.890 --> 01:37.824
The samples downstairs
should help

01:37.860 --> 01:40.420
refresh my own
olfactory abilities.

01:40.460 --> 01:41.722
This is seriously our next case?

01:41.760 --> 01:42.897
Sniffing out

01:42.930 --> 01:44.727
bribes in
the wine auction world.

01:44.770 --> 01:46.738
New York is without
a homicide this week.

01:46.770 --> 01:48.328
I'm terribly sorry
that disappoints you.

01:48.370 --> 01:50.463
What's with the trampoline?

01:51.940 --> 01:54.170
It really is shocking
what they don't teach you

01:54.210 --> 01:55.837
in medical school.
Okay, forget I asked.

01:55.880 --> 01:58.348
The lymphatic system, unlike
the cardiovascular system,

01:58.380 --> 02:01.178
has no pumping capability; it
relies on muscular contraction.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.188
Bouncing up and down
is effective,

02:03.220 --> 02:04.812
because it stimulates
the system's one-way valves

02:04.850 --> 02:06.579
to open and close
simultaneously.

02:06.620 --> 02:08.588
You're increasing lymph
flow to boost your immunity

02:08.620 --> 02:10.679
to keep your sinuses
clear-- got it.

02:10.730 --> 02:12.322
Seemed like a wise choice.

02:12.360 --> 02:13.827
Why? Are you getting a cold?

02:13.860 --> 02:15.794
Not yet, but we live
in close quarters

02:15.830 --> 02:18.162
and I detected a phlegmy rattle
in your voice last night.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.599
I feel fine.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.789
Do you?

02:20.840 --> 02:22.501
(doorbell rings)

02:26.210 --> 02:27.905
I'm here to see Sherlock Holmes.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.771
I don't have
an appomtment.

02:29.810 --> 02:31.778
But I do have money.

02:31.810 --> 02:33.846
(panﬁng)

02:33.880 --> 02:37.247
*

03:07.380 --> 03:09.382
Okay, you're luclq the bullet
didn't hit a major artery.

03:09.420 --> 03:10.489
You should be careful
with that wrist.

03:10.520 --> 03:11.487
It looks like
it could be broken.

03:11.520 --> 03:13.852
No, it isn't.
You don't know that.

03:13.890 --> 03:14.959
It's a sprain.
Are you a doctor?

03:14.990 --> 03:16.719
Are you?

03:16.760 --> 03:17.920
HOLMES:
There's no one out there.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.723
You're safe for the moment.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.694
Perhaps now you can
formally introduce yourself.

03:21.730 --> 03:23.869
My name's Lin. Lin Wen.

03:23.900 --> 03:26.733
How'd you come to hear of me,
Ms. Wen?

03:26.770 --> 03:28.397
I knew your brother, Mycroft.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.805
I'm a realtor.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.660
I showed him some spaces
when he was interested

03:31.710 --> 03:34.508
in relocating his restaurant,
Diogenes.

03:34.540 --> 03:35.529
Ow!

03:35.580 --> 03:37.400
I have to put pressure on it.

03:37.450 --> 03:38.576
How were you wounded?

03:38.610 --> 03:39.611
When I got home
last night,

03:39.650 --> 03:41.345
there was someone
In my apartment.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.517
They started shooting.

03:42.550 --> 03:43.983
I got out to my fire escape,

03:44.020 --> 03:46.011
and then Ijustjumped.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.359
And the reason you didn't
go straight to the police?

03:48.390 --> 03:50.620
It's complicated.
They ask too many questions.

03:50.660 --> 03:52.355
You imagined we wouldn't?

03:52.400 --> 03:53.651
This is not a shelter

03:53.700 --> 03:54.997
for wayward
and wounded realtors.

03:55.030 --> 03:57.260
I've got no desire to be shot
by your pursuers

03:57.300 --> 03:58.619
or drawn into
whatever complicated drama

03:58.670 --> 04:00.365
has brought you here.

04:00.400 --> 04:01.992
So tell us,
why shouldn't we continue this

04:02.040 --> 04:03.701
in the safety
of a police facility?

04:03.740 --> 04:05.560
Please, I told you,
I wasn't followed.

04:05.610 --> 04:06.577
You can trust me.

04:06.610 --> 04:07.770
I don't know you.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.641
Mycroft said
you help people.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.319
He said you weren't afraid
of anything. Was he lying?

04:16.820 --> 04:19.812
HOLMES: So that currency band
is not from a commercial bank.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.350
Perhaps you could begin
by explaining

04:21.390 --> 04:22.687
that troubling detail.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.755
It isn't mine.

04:24.790 --> 04:27.293
That's not less troubling.

04:27.330 --> 04:28.524
Like I said,

04:28.560 --> 04:30.596
I'm in real estate.

04:30.630 --> 04:32.962
Sometimes, to make
a little extra money, I host

04:33.000 --> 04:35.662
no-limit poker games
in my empty listings.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.804
Big cash games.

04:37.840 --> 04:39.774
About a week ago,
I put together a table

04:39.810 --> 04:41.675
at this amazing penthouse.

04:41.710 --> 04:43.541
Seven high rollers.

04:43.580 --> 04:46.003
Some shady types, but all guys
I thought I could trust.

04:46.050 --> 04:48.018
The game was going long,
so I stepped out

04:48.050 --> 04:49.688
to get some more drinks.

04:49.720 --> 04:51.813
While I was gone,
two guys in hockey masks

04:51.850 --> 04:53.818
stormed in
and roughed up my dealer.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.658
They took off with the keys
to one of the player's cars,

04:56.690 --> 04:58.521
a Bentley, and all the cash.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.528
$1.2 million.
Can we assume

05:00.560 --> 05:02.892
that you did not report this
to the police either?

05:02.930 --> 05:04.591
No.

05:04.630 --> 05:06.860
I didn't report my illegal
gaming business to the police.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.529
I mean, maybe I should have.

05:10.570 --> 05:12.709
I was just hoping
it would all blow over,

05:12.740 --> 05:15.709
and some of the players started
digging into it themselves.

05:15.740 --> 05:17.605
Perhaps one of them
was beginning to zero in

05:17.650 --> 05:20.073
on the truth, then the real
thieves decided to frame you

05:20.120 --> 05:21.644
before it was too late.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.681
You say that was

05:22.720 --> 05:24.381
planted at
your apartment.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.456
That and about
half million more.

05:26.490 --> 05:28.788
As soon as I found it,
the bullets started flying.

05:28.820 --> 05:31.027
I guess they figured if I
was dead, I couldn't deny

05:31.060 --> 05:32.721
knocking over
my own game.

05:32.760 --> 05:34.648
Did you get a look
at your would-be assassin?

05:34.700 --> 05:36.395
No. I just took off.

05:36.430 --> 05:37.761
Who knew
about the game?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.859
I put the word out
the day before.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.937
Everybody wanted in.
Seven players, the dealer.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.767
And I had a lookout,

05:44.810 --> 05:47.870
Ian Walker--
not that it did me any good.

05:47.910 --> 05:50.640
I checked on him that
night, but he was gone.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.773
Hasn't returned
my calls smce.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.141
And you don't suspect him
because...?

05:55.180 --> 05:57.148
The guys who ripped off the game
were pros.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.784
Ian was just some idiot intern
at my office.

05:59.820 --> 06:03.051
He didn't have time
to plan a heist, okay?

06:03.090 --> 06:04.978
I grabbed him at the
last minute, offered him

06:05.030 --> 06:07.828
1,000 bucks
to just stand outside the door.

06:07.860 --> 06:09.896
If I were to guess,

06:09.930 --> 06:11.989
the thieves just paid him $2,000
to walk away.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.895
So tell us
about your players.

06:13.940 --> 06:15.896
I know their names.

06:15.940 --> 06:18.829
Contact information?
Places of employment?

06:18.870 --> 06:20.508
It was all in my phone,
which I dropped

06:20.540 --> 06:21.905
when I thought I was gonna die.

06:21.940 --> 06:23.601
It's back at my place.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.447
I'll retrieve it
when I examine the scene.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.447
The address?

06:26.480 --> 06:28.072
849 Broome Street, 2D.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.611
Stay here, would you?

06:30.650 --> 06:31.912
(footsteps departing)

06:33.790 --> 06:35.917
If you decide
to offer her a bath,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.622
please be careful removing
the fermentation accoutrement

06:38.660 --> 06:40.628
from the tub.

06:40.660 --> 06:41.752
You look vexed.

06:41.800 --> 06:43.768
Iam.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.893
This woman, she gives
me a weird feeling.

06:45.930 --> 06:48.763
Something about her and
her story that's really strange.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.167
Do you remember Mycroft ever
planning to move Diogenes?

06:52.210 --> 06:53.370
I don't remember his birthday.

06:53.410 --> 06:55.799
As you know, I do my best
to purge nonvital information.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.977
Clutters the mind.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.875
Well, I think he would've
told me something like that.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.446
We got pretty close before

07:00.480 --> 07:01.845
the NSA took him
out of the country.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.689
You were sex partners,
not business partners.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.415
Why would moving his restaurant
be any of your concern?

07:07.160 --> 07:09.720
Your concern over Ms. Wen
IS correct and duly noted,

07:09.760 --> 07:12.126
but so is her gunshot wound
and fractured radius.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.720
And, to be fair, Mycroft was
in the unfortunate habit

07:14.760 --> 07:16.569
of telling other people
about my work.

07:16.600 --> 07:19.194
Her tale of woe might conceal
some darker purpose,

07:19.230 --> 07:21.562
but might be legitimate.

07:21.600 --> 07:24.865
Fine. You go, but I'm gonna
keep a close eye on her.

07:24.910 --> 07:26.901
As you should.

07:36.150 --> 07:38.710
(knocking on door)

07:43.890 --> 07:45.721
(knocking continues)

07:52.800 --> 07:54.893
(knocking continues)

08:02.880 --> 08:04.905
Hello.

08:04.950 --> 08:07.748
Who are you? Where's Lin?

08:07.780 --> 08:09.919
I'm a detective
that she's hired to investigate

08:09.950 --> 08:11.679
the attempt on her life
last night.

08:13.160 --> 08:16.721
Y-You don't seem entirely
surprised to hear that news.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.052
Lin called me last night.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.658
Ithought
something happened here

08:21.700 --> 08:23.258
because she left me
a weird v0ice mail,

08:23.300 --> 08:25.962
and I couldn't tell if it
was serious or not, but...

08:26.000 --> 08:27.991
Could I hear that voice mail?

08:31.270 --> 08:34.137
LIN: It's me.
Listen, something's wrong.

08:34.180 --> 08:36.603
Ifound...
(beep)

08:36.650 --> 08:38.845
Thank you.

08:38.880 --> 08:41.019
You must be Lin's poker dealer.

08:41.050 --> 08:43.189
Sofia. How did you know?

08:43.220 --> 08:46.109
Uh, your, uh, fingernails,

08:46.150 --> 08:47.788
clipped and unpainted,
are at odds

08:47.820 --> 08:49.720
with your carefully applied
mascara and lip tint,

08:49.760 --> 08:51.648
but necessitated
by your profe55ion.

08:51.690 --> 08:52.952
And also your

08:53.000 --> 08:54.888
periorbital hematoma
is yellowing, so...

08:54.930 --> 08:56.625
it's about a week old.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.319
Lin told you what happened
at the game?

08:58.370 --> 08:59.894
Mm.

08:59.940 --> 09:01.737
She was outside
when the robbery occurred,

09:01.770 --> 09:03.635
and you were inside.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.673
Very much like
to discuss what you saw.

09:12.980 --> 09:15.039
It was about 2:00 am.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.048
A few players were almost
down to the felt,

09:17.090 --> 09:20.059
but they're all hanging in,
when these two guys--

09:20.090 --> 09:23.651
they were both in hockey masks--
they kicked the door in.

09:23.690 --> 09:25.658
They had
these shiny little guns,

09:25.690 --> 09:29.660
and they fired warning shots
into the ceiling.

09:29.700 --> 09:33.659
They were yelling for everyone
to... empty their pockets.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.065
They wanted everything.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.204
Cash, wallets, jewelry, keys.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.629
They asked me
to gather it all up,

09:39.680 --> 09:41.136
but I guess
I was too slow,

09:41.180 --> 09:44.308
because the tall one, he...

09:44.350 --> 09:47.239
clocked me
with the butt of his gun.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.215
I don't remember
anything else too clearly.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.138
You were concussed?

09:52.190 --> 09:55.853
Afterward,
I was slurring my words.

09:55.890 --> 09:58.120
Lin took me to the ER.

09:58.160 --> 10:02.051
They said I had a hairline
orbital fracture, too.

10:02.100 --> 10:04.091
They didn't ask you
any questions there?

10:04.130 --> 10:07.133
I told them
I fell off a ladder.

10:07.170 --> 10:10.003
Lin begged me
not to tell them the truth.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.133
She said she would cover
my medical bills,

10:12.170 --> 10:14.832
and I couldn't afford
to say no.

10:16.880 --> 10:20.077
This is gonna need
some cosmetic work, too.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.145
The, uh, burn on
your arm, that's new.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.784
Oh, yes. The result
of falling

10:25.820 --> 10:28.050
on a spent shell casing, no?
Yeah.

10:28.090 --> 10:30.149
Stung like hell.

10:30.190 --> 10:31.726
Excuse me.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.250
Little bit short
for a nine millimeter.

10:36.300 --> 10:38.860
Okay.

10:38.900 --> 10:40.663
Well, it's quite
a salient detail.

10:40.700 --> 10:44.033
I'd wager the thieves
were using...

10:44.070 --> 10:45.332
Makarov bullets.

10:45.370 --> 10:47.008
Those are Russian-made,

10:47.040 --> 10:49.008
and they don't fit into
very many small weapons

10:49.040 --> 10:51.042
like you're describing,

10:51.080 --> 10:54.049
so perhaps they were
carrying PA-63 pistols.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.048
Are those rare or something?

10:56.080 --> 10:57.911
Uh, not vanishingly so.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.759
You can usually lay hands
on one at a gun show.

10:59.790 --> 11:01.815
One of your players
that night,

11:01.860 --> 11:03.725
James Hobberkin,
how is he faring?

11:03.760 --> 11:05.125
Not great.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.094
He was playing
a little too loose.

11:07.130 --> 11:08.791
Hmm.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.890
He owns and operates
one of the largest

11:11.930 --> 11:14.467
annual weapons expositions
in the tristate area.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.809
WATSON :
I did my best,

11:16.840 --> 11:18.432
but you are gonna
have a scar.

11:18.470 --> 11:20.176
(groans) Awesome.

11:22.240 --> 11:25.209
I wouldn't put too much pressure
on that wrist either.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.148
I don't care if I lose the arm.

11:26.180 --> 11:27.909
I got to get away
from the stench in here.

11:27.950 --> 11:30.009
_It's like someone
lit a diaper on fire.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.915
(chuckles)

11:31.950 --> 11:34.453
Yeah, it has to do
with another case.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.982
You do pretty good work
for a detective.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.123
I used to be a surgeon.

11:40.160 --> 11:42.492
And now you do this?

11:42.530 --> 11:45.795
That must have been
a tough chat with the folks.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.094
"Thanks for the med school,
but I'm off to fight crime

11:48.140 --> 11:50.131
with my roommate."

11:50.170 --> 11:54.129
I'm happier, they're happy,
and I'm saving on rent.

11:54.180 --> 11:57.149
You know, I used to live,
uh, near Gramercy Park,

11:57.180 --> 12:00.115
and I don't have to tell you
how pricey that area is getting.

12:00.150 --> 12:02.118
I just sold a studio there
last month.

12:02.150 --> 12:03.412
It's crazy.

12:03.450 --> 12:07.056
I think it's a bubble.

12:07.090 --> 12:09.217
Sounds like you do
mostly residential work.

12:11.430 --> 12:14.797
So, uh, how did you and Mycroft
start working together?

12:14.830 --> 12:16.229
When he was looking
at restaurant spaces?

12:16.260 --> 12:19.127
I made an exception for him.

12:19.170 --> 12:20.364
Oh, yeah?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.197
Why?

12:22.240 --> 12:23.969
Because...

12:24.010 --> 12:26.501
he wasn't just a client.

12:26.540 --> 12:28.132
We were together.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.148
You were dating.

12:31.180 --> 12:33.273
It was a new thing,
but, I don't know, I...

12:33.320 --> 12:37.279
I kind of thought
we might move in together.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.882
Then that fire broke out
at Diogenes, and...

12:41.920 --> 12:43.922
just like that, he was gone.

12:43.960 --> 12:47.919
I'm sure Sherlock told you
the whole story.

12:47.960 --> 12:50.292
So you and Mycroft
were dating until...

12:50.330 --> 12:51.297
He died.

12:51.330 --> 12:53.366
It was weird,

12:53.400 --> 12:56.130
losing someone at the beginning
of a relationship, you know?

12:56.170 --> 12:57.535
But...

12:57.570 --> 12:59.834
I think he might
have been the one.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.507
What?

13:05.350 --> 13:09.047
I was just thinking I should
refresh that ice pack.

13:15.060 --> 13:16.254
You're Holmes.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.429
James Hobberkin Jr.
People call me Jimmer.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.223
If you say so.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.921
My girl tells me
you're on a deadline,

13:21.960 --> 13:22.927
so I'll cut right to it.

13:22.970 --> 13:25.495
This new law, banning
kids from gun shows--

13:25.530 --> 13:27.191
bleeding heart garbage.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.390
The government only
does two things well:

13:29.440 --> 13:31.203
nothing and overreact.

13:31.240 --> 13:33.538
And you can quote me.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.935
Thank you, but no.

13:35.980 --> 13:38.403
Excuse me?

13:38.450 --> 13:40.213
I misled your girl. I'm not
a journalist writing an article.

13:40.250 --> 13:42.275
I just needed a moment
of your time.

13:42.320 --> 13:45.585
A week ago, a poker game that
you were playing in was robbed.

13:45.620 --> 13:47.281
I've been hired to
find out who did it.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.151
I'm not at liberty
to say by whom.

13:49.190 --> 13:52.125
You're a detective.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.151
Well, you should have said so.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.156
Hell, me and the guy
you're working for,

13:56.200 --> 13:57.292
we're in the same boat.

13:57.330 --> 13:58.991
No, I'm not so sure about that.

13:59.030 --> 14:00.292
I've come to believe
that the thieves

14:00.340 --> 14:03.229
were armed with FEG PA-63s.

14:03.270 --> 14:06.330
According to the state of
New York, your company sold

14:06.370 --> 14:09.339
half a dozen such weapons
in the last two years.

14:09.380 --> 14:11.075
(chuckles):
Wait.

14:11.110 --> 14:14.079
I'm a suspect because
the robbers used guns?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.417
Oh, not just any guns.

14:15.450 --> 14:17.179
Give me a break.

14:17.220 --> 14:19.381
I had twice as much money
in that game

14:19.420 --> 14:20.978
as anyone else at the table.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.352
Mr. Hobberkin-- Jimmer--

14:23.390 --> 14:25.927
you were able to get yourself
dressed this morning,

14:25.960 --> 14:28.224
so you're smart enough to
realize how stupid that sounds.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.989
If all the money
ends up in your pocket,

14:30.030 --> 14:32.169
what difference does it matter
how much you have in play?

14:32.200 --> 14:34.191
Okay.

14:36.340 --> 14:38.661
If I'm lying, then...

14:38.710 --> 14:41.076
tell me:

14:41.110 --> 14:44.375
why did I hire a detective
of my own?

14:48.250 --> 14:50.241
Here.

14:52.420 --> 14:54.411
Irving Feldman
Investigations.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.224
He's out of New Jersey.
He's expensive.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.093
Hasn't found much yet,
but as you can see,

15:00.130 --> 15:01.688
I hired him
the day after the robbery.

15:01.730 --> 15:04.494
So his first move was to try
and locate the missing lookout,

15:04.530 --> 15:05.929
Ian Walker.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.335
Mm. He tried
to track his phone.

15:07.370 --> 15:09.338
Went to his house
a couple of times.

15:09.370 --> 15:11.338
Mail's piling up.

15:11.370 --> 15:13.133
Kid's gone.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.432
Lin's probably got him
laying low somewhere.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.674
You think Ms. Wen
robbed her own game?

15:16.710 --> 15:18.678
I don't think, I know.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.519
Somebody doesn't like that girl.
They dimed her out.

15:20.550 --> 15:22.677
I got an e-mail yesterday.

15:22.720 --> 15:24.483
Fake address,
but the intel was legit.

15:24.520 --> 15:25.680
Said the money

15:25.720 --> 15:27.449
was at her place,
and sure enough...

15:27.490 --> 15:29.481
You're the one
who shot at her last night.

15:31.530 --> 15:34.124
All I'll say, they were right.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.388
She did it.

15:35.430 --> 15:36.624
Find the money?

15:36.660 --> 15:38.366
Not all of it, not even
what I lost personally,

15:38.400 --> 15:39.958
so I'm not sharing it,

15:40.000 --> 15:41.433
if that's
what you're getting at.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.462
Keeping the cash
at her own home,

15:44.510 --> 15:46.239
that would've been careless.

15:46.270 --> 15:48.477
You consider the possibility
she was framed?

15:48.510 --> 15:50.000
No.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.371
But, hey, find out
I got this all wrong,

15:52.410 --> 15:54.514
locate the rest of my money,
come show me...

15:56.380 --> 15:58.041
...I'll make it
worth your while.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.351
(phone ringing)

16:04.160 --> 16:06.151
Hey. I was beginning to think
that you'd abandoned me

16:06.190 --> 16:07.999
for the National Council
of Sommeliers.

16:08.030 --> 16:09.588
No, I was spending some time
at the other end

16:09.630 --> 16:11.427
of the cultural spectrum.
(siren approaching)

16:11.470 --> 16:13.768
Earlier today, I had
a rather fruitful tte--tte

16:13.800 --> 16:16.291
with one of the victimized
poker players:

16:16.340 --> 16:18.399
grown man who goes by
the name Jimmer.

16:18.440 --> 16:20.169
Oh, you think that's our guy?

16:20.210 --> 16:22.474
He all but admitted
to shooting at Ms. Wen.

16:22.510 --> 16:26.708
But it would appear that he is
just a trigger-happy pawn

16:26.750 --> 16:29.139
for whoever is attempting
to frame her.

16:29.180 --> 16:30.784
If that's the case,
we should move on

16:30.820 --> 16:32.412
to one of the other players.

16:32.450 --> 16:35.112
Hey, what about
that missing lookout?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.128
Ian Walker. Lin still hasn't

16:37.160 --> 16:38.752
been able to get in touch
with him.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.621
Jimmer Hobberkin's
private detective

16:40.660 --> 16:42.423
used a find-my-phone app

16:42.460 --> 16:43.768
to track Ian Walker's cell phone

16:43.800 --> 16:46.496
to an abandoned
construction site in Flatbush.

16:46.530 --> 16:49.294
He was quite convinced he'd
dumped it in a cement mixer,

16:49.340 --> 16:51.604
but I've come to realize
that he was mistaken,

16:51.640 --> 16:53.733
and that we can
remove Ian Walker

16:53.780 --> 16:55.771
from our list of suspects.

17:01.550 --> 17:04.280
LIN: I wish I could, but I'm
probably gonna be working late.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.447
I'm at this,
um, new listing.

17:06.490 --> 17:08.219
Mm. It's got good bones,
but the tenants haven't

17:08.260 --> 17:10.125
taken great care of it.
What the hell
are you doing?

17:10.160 --> 17:13.698
Oh, hey, Mom, listen,
I got to run. Okay, bye.

17:13.730 --> 17:16.051
I told you not to call anyone.
It's too dangerous.

17:16.100 --> 17:17.590
Look, I'm sorry,
but she worries about me.

17:17.630 --> 17:18.767
Single mom syndrome.

17:20.030 --> 17:22.737
It's okay. I used one of these
disposables you guys have here,

17:22.770 --> 17:24.601
and I'm sure I can
trust my own mother.

17:24.640 --> 17:27.404
This is not about trust; someone
could be monitoring her phone.

17:27.440 --> 17:31.274
Oh, come on. You know, I wish
I told her to put on some makeup

17:31.310 --> 17:33.073
just in case there are any
satellites pointed at her.

17:33.120 --> 17:34.576
Ian Walker is dead.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.838
What?
He didn't
abandon his post

17:36.880 --> 17:38.780
the night of the game,
someone killed him.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.549
Sherlock found his body.

17:40.590 --> 17:42.581
I was gonna tell you last night,
but you were already asleep.

17:42.620 --> 17:44.520
Do you think it's the same
person who shot at me?

17:44.560 --> 17:46.619
No, that would be
Jimme_r Hobberkin.
Jimmer?

17:46.660 --> 17:48.628
Someone convinced him that
you were behind the robbery.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.695
Odds are, they're the ones
who killed Ian, too.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.130
So, do the police know
that he's dead?

17:55.170 --> 17:56.239
Sherlock called them
last night.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.532
I know you didn't
want them involved,

17:57.570 --> 17:58.832
but a murder changes things.

17:58.870 --> 18:01.134
These are for you.
Get dressed.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.875
Got to go down to the precinct
and answer some questions.

18:02.910 --> 18:05.504
A detective is on her way
to pick you up.
Well, what about you?

18:05.550 --> 18:06.847
I have to meet Sherlock
at the morgue.

18:06.880 --> 18:10.441
We have some questions
we have to answer, too.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.482
The cause of Mr. Walker's death
is a little tough to sort out.

18:13.520 --> 18:15.158
BELL:
Doubt it helped

18:15.190 --> 18:16.782
that this guy was
rotting in a drain pipe

18:16.820 --> 18:19.880
for a week while your client
was pretending nothing happened.

18:19.930 --> 18:22.228
I'm sure it didn't. But_t_here's
minimal decompOSItion.

18:22.260 --> 18:24.399
That can't be the reason cause
was difficult to ascertain.

18:24.430 --> 18:26.523
No, it's because
he was suffocated.

18:26.570 --> 18:28.197
With a chloroform-
soaked rag.

18:28.240 --> 18:30.800
Initially, I thought
it was toxicity.

18:30.840 --> 18:33.229
But actually,
he died from asphyxiation.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.134
Someone just held it over
his nose for too long.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.909
Could have been an accident.

18:36.940 --> 18:38.874
At least one of the gunmen was
pretty worked up that night.

18:38.910 --> 18:41.811
Hit the dealer so hard
she blacked out.

18:41.850 --> 18:42.748
Okay, but there's no good way

18:42.780 --> 18:44.680
to estimate time of death
at this point.

18:44.720 --> 18:46.483
Maybe Walker was killed
at the scene of the robbery,

18:46.520 --> 18:47.487
maybe he wasn't.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.181
He could have been in on it,

18:49.220 --> 18:50.653
then got offed
by his partners later.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.851
His trainers suggest otherwise.

18:52.890 --> 18:53.822
The scuffs on the heel

18:53.860 --> 18:56.590
are incongruent
with the newness of the shoes.

18:56.630 --> 18:58.188
Note also
that they are clean.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.596
The area I found him
was very muddy.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.267
So perhaps he was
killed at his post,

19:02.300 --> 19:03.858
dragged away, then later carried

19:03.910 --> 19:05.832
to his final resting place
by a heaw smoker.

19:05.870 --> 19:09.374
Yeah. I hurried the mass
spec, per your request.

19:09.410 --> 19:11.674
Glycerin triacetate
and tobacco all over

19:11.710 --> 19:13.439
the back of
Ian's sweatshirt.

19:13.480 --> 19:14.549
Domestic cigarettes.

19:14.580 --> 19:16.775
I also detected faint traces
of charcoal and coconut.

19:16.820 --> 19:20.187
Right. Killer must have
come straight from a luau.

19:20.220 --> 19:21.949
While anything's possible,
I think it would be premature

19:21.990 --> 19:23.958
to trawl about
at local PolyneSIan venues.

19:23.990 --> 19:26.356
Better we focus
on the penthouse in Tribeca

19:26.390 --> 19:27.823
where the robbery was staged.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.452
In the works. New
owner's been notified.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.297
I'm meeting the
captain there in 30.

19:31.330 --> 19:34.493
I'll go.
You check on Ms. Wen.

19:34.540 --> 19:36.496
Actually, I think
you both should.

19:36.540 --> 19:38.360
You didn't tell the captain
about an armed robbery

19:38.410 --> 19:39.434
for 24 hours.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.869
Maybe give him that long

19:40.910 --> 19:42.969
to forgive you.

19:43.010 --> 19:45.843
(sighs)

19:45.880 --> 19:47.245
(knocking)

19:47.280 --> 19:48.816
No, end of the hall.
Tell him.

19:48.850 --> 19:50.579
Mel Cheney.
Captain Gregson.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.588
You and I spoke...

19:52.620 --> 19:54.212
I thought you were gonna

19:54.260 --> 19:55.488
hold off on
this move today.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.556
I called the company, but the
truck was already on its way.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.956
You can work around them,
can't you?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.550
No, not really. I was
thinking this scuff

20:02.600 --> 20:04.522
was made by a dead lookout
getting dragged off.

20:04.570 --> 20:06.561
Now I can't be sure
one of your guys

20:06.600 --> 20:08.397
didn't just bump it
carrying a table.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.498
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't

20:09.540 --> 20:11.701
rearrange my whole life
for the NYPD.

20:11.740 --> 20:13.571
I told you,

20:13.610 --> 20:14.975
I didn't even have the keys
to this place

20:15.010 --> 20:16.534
when this whole poker thing
happened, so...

20:16.580 --> 20:18.445
Whatever. Come in.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.471
I'll tell the guys
to take five.

20:23.550 --> 20:25.916
I swept the back half-- nothing.

20:25.950 --> 20:29.909
Also talked to the downstairs
neighbor, Mrs. Ellis, age 92.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.827
She claims, on the night of
the robbery, she was asleep.

20:32.860 --> 20:34.896
For once, I'm gonna
call that a solid alibi.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.591
There's nothing here.

20:36.630 --> 20:38.860
Yeah. Just some plastered-over

20:38.900 --> 20:40.629
_ bullet_ holes
in the ceiling here,

20:40.670 --> 20:42.262
right next to
the lighting can.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.700
Our friends' friend,
the realtor,

20:44.740 --> 20:47.675
hired a subcontractor
to clean up

20:47.710 --> 20:51.305
so_ the new owner
wouldn't find out what happened.

20:51.350 --> 20:52.647
It's all sanded and spackled.

20:52.680 --> 20:53.840
I mean, CSU can

20:53.880 --> 20:56.519
undo it so we can at least
confirm the make of the weapons,

20:56.550 --> 20:58.541
but that's about it.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.379
What?

21:05.360 --> 21:07.453
Something on my tie?

21:07.500 --> 21:10.492
No, I was just thinking
you look... different.

21:10.530 --> 21:12.919
Oh, lost a few pounds.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.767
I mean, you look different
than you did

21:14.800 --> 21:16.392
when you were standing
over here.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.707
There's something weird
about the light.

21:27.720 --> 21:30.689
Aside from the fact it casts a
cooler hue, you'd never know

21:30.720 --> 21:33.518
there's a tiny little
spy camera in there.
Yes, I would.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.358
I'm pretty sure that the
signal range was enough

21:36.390 --> 21:37.687
to reach local Wi-Fi.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.357
So the thieves
could see the room

21:39.390 --> 21:41.529
they were about
to storm into.
In 1080p.

21:41.560 --> 21:43.528
State-of-the-art
motion sensor.

21:43.570 --> 21:44.992
You screw it in,
andiUsHve.

21:45.030 --> 21:46.065
Impressive.

21:46.100 --> 21:47.692
Creepy is more like it.

21:47.740 --> 21:49.799
My kudos were for you,
not for the bulb.

21:49.840 --> 21:51.660
I'm glad to see
you're taking my encouragement

21:51.710 --> 21:53.837
to stay abreast of modern
surveillance technology.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.700
(door opens)

21:58.010 --> 21:59.875
We have a deal?

21:59.910 --> 22:02.572
In exchange for cooperation,
18 months probation

22:02.620 --> 22:04.781
and mandatory attendance
of Gam-Anon.

22:04.820 --> 22:08.051
Well, Ms. Wen, you can start
cooperating right now.

22:08.090 --> 22:10.752
You recognize this?
There's a camera inside.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.781
_ Someone screwed it in
right over your poker table.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.627
What?

22:14.660 --> 22:16.594
The warning shots
the thieves fired almost hit it.

22:18.770 --> 22:21.068
I don't get it.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.328
This isn't mine.

22:22.370 --> 22:25.806
Before the last open house, I
put 27-watt bulbs in everywhere.

22:25.840 --> 22:28.502
It's a staging thing--
makes the space more inviting.

22:28.540 --> 22:29.905
WATSON: I thought you said
no one knew where

22:29.940 --> 22:31.976
or when the game was being
played until the clay of.

22:32.010 --> 22:33.773
They didn't.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.914
And I was in there making calls
and setting up most of the day.

22:36.950 --> 22:38.815
So no one was in there
by themselves?

22:38.850 --> 22:41.557
Not before, during,
even after the game?

22:41.590 --> 22:44.957
The first player who showed up,
Mateo Pea--

22:44.990 --> 22:46.753
he spilled some soda
on the floor.

22:46.790 --> 22:48.997
I left to get a towel
to clean it up,

22:49.030 --> 22:51.999
but I was only gone
for, like, 30 seconds.

22:52.030 --> 22:54.737
How long does it take you
to screw in a lightbulb?

23:02.780 --> 23:05.044
Two creamers.

23:07.110 --> 23:10.944
Now can you tell me why the,
uh, NYPD wants to talk to me?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.049
You really can't guess,
Mr. Pea?

23:13.090 --> 23:15.615
Th-The poker game?

23:15.660 --> 23:16.888
BELL:
Yes.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.751
It has to do with the
illegal poker game

23:18.790 --> 23:20.018
you were at
that got robbed.

23:20.060 --> 23:21.789
The one Lin Wen
organized

23:21.830 --> 23:24.196
where the lookout
was murdered.

23:24.230 --> 23:25.788
Someone was murdered?

23:25.830 --> 23:27.889
Is that really
news to you?

23:27.940 --> 23:29.635
Wait. You...

23:29.670 --> 23:31.069
You think I... I'm a suspect?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.463
That-that I would

23:32.510 --> 23:33.772
stage an armed robbery?

23:33.810 --> 23:35.437
I mean, come on. Look at me.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.936
Oh, we are looking at you.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.641
We see five empty cubicles.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.773
We see a very anxious
small business owner.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.948
Insufficient cash flow
is motive enough.

23:43.990 --> 23:46.743
I am stressed,
but you've got it backwards.

23:46.790 --> 23:48.815
My company's growing so fast,

23:48.860 --> 23:50.828
I had to get this new space;
we'll fill it up.

23:50.860 --> 23:52.157
W-We just landed
New Zealand, see?

23:52.190 --> 23:55.591
And what is it you do
for New Zealand?

23:55.630 --> 23:57.495
_ We _handle _
information security

23:57.530 --> 23:59.760
and digital infrastructure
for their UN. mission.

23:59.800 --> 24:01.165
We've got the Kiwis,

24:01.200 --> 24:03.998
Ukraine, Sudan,
half a dozen other delegations.

24:04.040 --> 24:06.702
So, no, cash flow
is not a problem for me.

24:06.740 --> 24:09.732
All right, let me tell you
what is a problem for you.

24:09.780 --> 24:13.079
This bulb you planted so your
pals knew when to crash in,

24:13.110 --> 24:14.611
guns blazing.

24:14.650 --> 24:15.719
I-I don't, uh...

24:15.750 --> 24:17.513
See the black powder?

24:17.550 --> 24:19.609
It yielded two very good
fingerprints: a right index

24:19.650 --> 24:21.208
and a thumb.
Personally,

24:21.260 --> 24:23.182
I hate powdered creamer
in my coffee,

24:23.220 --> 24:24.687
but the residue
on your fingers

24:24.730 --> 24:26.721
should help give us
a very good match.

24:26.760 --> 24:29.729
Look”.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.796
I hid the camera that night,

24:31.830 --> 24:34.936
but I didn't have anything
to do with the robbery.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.699
Keep talking.

24:36.740 --> 24:39.561
Camera was
to help me cheat.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.601
I know what you're thinking.
I'm a numbers guy.

24:41.640 --> 24:44.108
But not in a way that translates
to being good at cards.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.742
At least not good enough.

24:45.780 --> 24:47.179
I found that out the hard way

24:47.210 --> 24:50.111
the first few times I played
in the games Lin put together.

24:50.150 --> 24:52.209
So, I started using
the lightbulb cameras

24:52.250 --> 24:54.810
and wearing an earwig
so I could hear instructions.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.158
I assume your Cyrano
will be able to confirm this?

24:58.660 --> 25:00.082
I don't know what that means.

25:00.130 --> 25:03.588
But my assistant, Trevor--
he'd watch the flop,

25:03.630 --> 25:06.599
and enter all the cards in play
into a probability algorithm.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.836
What about your cards?

25:07.870 --> 25:09.633
We had signals.

25:09.670 --> 25:11.001
He'd feed me the odds.

25:11.040 --> 25:13.031
It'd help me make good bets.

25:13.070 --> 25:15.231
I started winning a little.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.009
Enough to salvage
a little pride.

25:17.040 --> 25:19.076
You were proud of cheating?

25:19.110 --> 25:21.078
Just talk to Trevor.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.917
He'll tell you.

25:22.950 --> 25:25.544
I've been complaining about that
robbery ever since it happened.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.739
Now I'll never get

25:26.790 --> 25:28.189
to play
with those guys again.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.653
And why would
that matter?

25:29.690 --> 25:31.555
I don't know.

25:31.590 --> 25:34.923
I think about all the time
I wasted studying game footage

25:34.960 --> 25:37.599
to figure out
the tells...
You kept the footage?

25:37.630 --> 25:40.269
Sorry, but if you're gonna keep
incriminating evidence around,

25:40.300 --> 25:42.689
you really ought to put it
on an air gapped machine

25:42.740 --> 25:44.901
in a secure server room, right?

25:48.040 --> 25:51.669
Okay, so send the footage to
these three e-mails, right?

25:51.710 --> 25:53.678
That's right.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.347
What are you doing?

25:55.380 --> 25:58.110
Calling TARU, letting them know
the footage is on its way.

25:58.150 --> 25:59.845
No, you won't get a signal.

25:59.890 --> 26:02.279
These walls_have _been coated
With aluminum iron OXIde.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.322
Yeah, the-the stuff is mixed
into the paint

26:04.360 --> 26:06.089
to block wireless signals.

26:06.130 --> 26:08.655
You can smell that?
Yeah.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.294
Unlike a few master
sommeliers I could name.

26:11.330 --> 26:14.163
_ LIN:
I like your turtle.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.964
The one downstairs.
His bowl said "Clyde."

26:17.000 --> 26:19.002
Thanks.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.644
So, you used to cut people open
for a living,

26:27.680 --> 26:28.874
and now you're a private eye.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.376
Why'd you quit?

26:30.420 --> 26:32.308
You develop an allergy
to making money or something?

26:32.350 --> 26:35.012
I'm a little busy right now;
Mateo Pea just turned over

26:35.060 --> 26:36.357
footage from the robbery.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.358
I'm about to get a look
at the thieves.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.119
LIN: Looks like
we're about to

26:40.160 --> 26:41.525
getalook
down my blouse, too.

26:45.400 --> 26:47.698
You don't like me
very much, do you?

26:47.740 --> 26:49.731
You're a client.
I don't have to like you.

26:49.770 --> 26:51.306
I just have to help you.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.148
You were with him, too,
weren't you?

27:01.180 --> 27:02.716
Mycroft?

27:02.750 --> 27:04.308
(sighs)

27:04.350 --> 27:06.045
You were.

27:06.090 --> 27:08.058
Wow. Guess he had
a type, huh?

27:08.090 --> 27:09.717
Do you mind?

27:09.760 --> 27:11.648
Do you think
he dumped you for me?

27:11.690 --> 27:13.157
Is that why
you don't like me?
He didn't dump me.

27:13.190 --> 27:14.396
Oh, my God.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.091
Was he seeing us
at the same time?

27:16.130 --> 27:18.223
That's what you think.

27:18.270 --> 27:20.295
You think he was
two-timing you.

27:20.330 --> 27:23.390
Say he was. That would mean
he was also two-timing you.

27:23.440 --> 27:25.237
True, but it's not like
he and I were exclusive.

27:25.270 --> 27:26.965
You said you were about
to move in together.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.329
Sure, but that
wouldn't have meant

27:28.380 --> 27:29.779
we had to stop having fun.

27:29.810 --> 27:31.141
You're missing the show,
by the way.

27:31.180 --> 27:32.772
(sighs)

27:36.880 --> 27:38.780
What happened?

27:39.820 --> 27:41.754
Miss Watson, can you hear me?

27:41.790 --> 27:43.155
Agent McNally?

27:43.190 --> 27:44.726
Yeah, it's been a while.

27:44.760 --> 27:46.159
I'd like you and your friend

27:46.190 --> 27:48.795
to put your hands on the table
away from the computer.

27:48.830 --> 27:49.922
Now!

27:49.960 --> 27:51.928
What is this?

27:51.970 --> 27:54.131
The end of your investigation,
I'm afraid.

27:54.170 --> 27:55.990
We're confiscating the footage
you were watching.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.860
It and your laptop
are being wiped.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.707
Hold on. That's evidence
for a murder investigation.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.105
The NSA can't do this.

28:01.140 --> 28:02.698
Actually, we just did.

28:02.740 --> 28:04.344
And tell your partner
to stay away from this one.

28:04.380 --> 28:05.369
What are you talking about?

28:14.390 --> 28:17.257
WATSON:
Sherlock?
Let there be light.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.382
Bullocks.

28:18.430 --> 28:20.386
Wait.

28:20.430 --> 28:23.251
Is that my sports bra holding up
a flashlight on your head?

28:23.300 --> 28:25.768
Couldn't find my miner's helmet
in the dark.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.392
The irony's not lost.

28:27.430 --> 28:29.830
(sighs) I thought the electric
company was gonna be able

28:29.870 --> 28:31.360
to turn the power on
from their end.

28:31.410 --> 28:34.231
They found the glitch
in their system.

28:34.280 --> 28:35.872
Our board was shortened,
however,

28:35.910 --> 28:37.229
by the restoration of power.

28:37.280 --> 28:38.872
Next time I see
Agent McNally,

28:38.910 --> 28:40.400
I'm going to invoice him
for my labor.

28:40.450 --> 28:43.908
This stunt was excessively
juvenile, even for an agency

28:43.950 --> 28:45.941
which self-identifies
as "Big Brother."

28:45.990 --> 28:47.912
That's funny,
because I came down here

28:47.960 --> 28:50.281
to talk to you
about your brother.
By all means.

28:50.320 --> 28:53.380
Distract me why I'm holding
240 volts in my hand.

28:54.830 --> 28:57.424
I take it you still think
there's something amiss

28:57.460 --> 28:59.792
about Ms. Wen's connection
to your ex-lover.

28:59.830 --> 29:01.138
It's more than a feeling.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.899
That's why I reached out
to your father yesterday.

29:02.940 --> 29:05.261
I asked him
to get a message to Mycroft.

29:05.310 --> 29:06.459
So, you risked Mycroft's safety

29:06.510 --> 29:08.375
and indebted yourself
to Morland Holmes.

29:08.410 --> 29:10.435
Well, Morland e-mailed me back;
he said that Mycroft is safe

29:10.480 --> 29:12.345
and alive on some
GreCIan island.

29:12.380 --> 29:15.019
I have no idea which one.
But here's the thing.

29:15.050 --> 29:16.472
He has never heard of Lin Wen.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.512
Do you think it's possible
that they were lovers?

29:19.550 --> 29:22.212
What?

29:22.260 --> 29:24.023
Mycroft and Ms. Wen.

29:24.060 --> 29:26.119
Well, she claimed they were.
Then isn't it also

29:26.160 --> 29:28.458
possible that he was just trying
to spare your feelings

29:28.500 --> 29:30.127
in his own self-serving
kind of way?

29:30.160 --> 29:32.299
Yes, it's possible.
I warned you when

29:32.330 --> 29:34.469
you took up with the man that
he's not without his faults,

29:34.500 --> 29:36.297
and I'm not just talking about
his webbed toe.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.364
He has a webbed toe?

29:43.180 --> 29:44.147
(door closes)

29:44.180 --> 29:45.807
Looking for bugs?

29:45.850 --> 29:47.499
Maybe.
Don't bother.

29:47.550 --> 29:49.245
The NSA is slightly
more sophisticated

29:49.280 --> 29:51.009
than a cheating poker player.

29:51.050 --> 29:53.382
If they wanted to spy on us,
there are any number of devices

29:53.420 --> 29:55.479
in our home which could serve
as hot mics--

29:55.520 --> 29:57.181
computers, phones, televisions.

29:57.220 --> 29:59.222
We have little choice
but to do as they say.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.490
But somebody tried to kill me,
and they did kill Ian.

30:01.530 --> 30:03.350
Are you seriously just gonna
walk away from that?

30:03.400 --> 30:06.096
I'm sorry. It's over.

30:06.130 --> 30:08.360
You can stay with us
if you like.

30:08.400 --> 30:11.369
The matter may soon resolve
itself of its own accord.

30:14.440 --> 30:15.407
Thank you.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.078
Now if you don't mind,

30:17.110 --> 30:19.476
this is where I usually
listen to music and think.

30:22.120 --> 30:24.088
(rock music playing loudly)

30:29.320 --> 30:30.514
This is a minor setback.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.357
We don't take orders
from the NSA.

30:32.390 --> 30:33.550
We just need to approach

30:33.590 --> 30:35.524
your list of players
from a different angle.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.927
Actually, the overhead angle of
the game was very interesting.

30:38.970 --> 30:42.030
I noticed one of the thieves
had really bad hair plugs.

30:42.070 --> 30:43.537
I'm talking
baby doll hair.

30:43.570 --> 30:45.299
So?

30:45.340 --> 30:47.137
So there can't be that many
hair restoration surgeons

30:47.170 --> 30:49.479
in New York who are still
punch-grafting.

30:49.510 --> 30:53.298
Find the guy who did the work,
we find the thief.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.238
(upbeat Middle Eastern music
Playing)

30:55.280 --> 30:57.419
How did you get this?

30:57.450 --> 30:59.213
My medical records
are private, no?

30:59.250 --> 31:01.957
This might shock you, Mr. Celik,

31:01.990 --> 31:04.220
but we didn't find
a single ethical clerk

31:04.260 --> 31:07.525
in any of the three cheapest
hair clinics in the city.

31:07.560 --> 31:11.018
It would cost more to purchase
one of these hookers than it did

31:11.070 --> 31:13.368
to buy the files of all their
military-age male patients.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.539
But that's illegal.

31:15.570 --> 31:16.662
Oh, completely.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.531
This file would not be
admissible in a court of law.

31:18.570 --> 31:21.209
No question.
WATSON: It's also irrelevant.

31:21.240 --> 31:24.300
I mean, no one's facing charges
for getting cheap hair plugs.

31:24.350 --> 31:26.500
No, all the evidence
presented at your trial

31:26.550 --> 31:28.347
will be about armed robbery
and murder.

31:28.380 --> 31:32.089
My trial? What are you saying?

31:32.120 --> 31:34.054
You wore a hockey mask,
but the Saturday before last,

31:34.090 --> 31:35.557
you robbed a poker game.

31:35.590 --> 31:36.614
I saw it on tape.

31:36.660 --> 31:39.982
And then I saw this
and recognized the hairline.

31:40.030 --> 31:43.090
The Saturday before last,
I was home.

31:43.130 --> 31:44.620
I read a book.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.467
Then it must_be_
an astronomical c0inCIdence

31:46.500 --> 31:48.058
that you stock these.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.534
The man who suffocated
Ian Walker

31:52.570 --> 31:54.538
left the scent
of coconut and charcoal

31:54.580 --> 31:56.605
all over the back
of his sweatshirt.

31:56.640 --> 31:58.073
Smelled just like
these hookah coals.

31:58.110 --> 31:59.577
Then it is a coincidence.

31:59.610 --> 32:01.373
I was home.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.672
You won't take my word?
Take my brother's.

32:03.720 --> 32:04.948
Murat!

32:04.990 --> 32:06.048
Buraya gel!

32:09.220 --> 32:12.621
These people want to know
where I was a week ago.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.128
Actually, it was more than
a week ago. It was last...

32:15.160 --> 32:16.149
We were home that night.

32:17.230 --> 32:19.289
Let me guess,

32:19.330 --> 32:20.524
you were
both reading.

32:20.570 --> 32:21.662
You think
we can't read?

32:21.700 --> 32:22.962
HOLMES:
Gentlemen, you must

32:23.000 --> 32:24.308
excuse my partner and I.

32:24.340 --> 32:25.602
We were mistaken.

32:25.640 --> 32:27.164
Good luck with
the book club.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.347
What happened in there?

32:35.380 --> 32:37.371
Those guys are the right
height, the right build,

32:37.420 --> 32:39.285
and their alibi...
Is preposterous.

32:39.320 --> 32:41.117
Reasonable questions
of literacy aside.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.151
Okay, so then why did
we stop questioning them?

32:43.190 --> 32:45.158
HOLMES: Because we can expect
more interesting answers

32:45.190 --> 32:47.158
from more interesting people.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.196
Your body odor is revolting,
even from here.

32:56.240 --> 32:58.629
I know the job is demanding, but
you should find more occasions

32:58.670 --> 33:00.535
to get into a shower.
Excuse me?

33:00.570 --> 33:02.538
The parking tickets
you've planted on the windshield

33:02.580 --> 33:04.639
are ancient, so I think
it's safe to assume

33:04.680 --> 33:06.545
that you've been keeping tabs
on the Brothers Celik here

33:06.580 --> 33:08.116
for quite some time.

33:08.150 --> 33:09.640
NSA?

33:09.680 --> 33:11.648
How they failed to notice
this van a-rocking

33:11.690 --> 33:13.783
and not come a-knocking
is beyond my comprehension.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.152
But I will draw their attention
over here

33:16.190 --> 33:18.579
if I don't get an audience
with Agent McNally.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.154
Washington Square Park.

33:20.190 --> 33:21.794
I'll be at the chess tables
on my own.

33:21.830 --> 33:24.765
Have someone pick me up there
in half an hour. Understood?

33:26.800 --> 33:28.392
(quiet knock)

33:28.440 --> 33:29.668
Excellent.

33:29.700 --> 33:31.338
You're going alone?

33:31.370 --> 33:32.632
I think it's best
that way.

33:32.670 --> 33:34.604
If I'm abducted by
the men in black,

33:34.640 --> 33:36.699
you can alert the authorities
that we do trust.

33:42.620 --> 33:44.281
What are you doing?

33:44.320 --> 33:46.117
Borrowing these.

33:46.150 --> 33:48.289
I would've asked, but that
would require me calling you

33:48.320 --> 33:50.413
on the phone, and I didn't want
another speech.

33:50.460 --> 33:52.587
And where do you think
you're going?
(sighs)

33:52.630 --> 33:54.359
You mean where do I know
I'm gomg?

33:54.400 --> 33:56.356
I have a life, bills, a job.

33:56.400 --> 33:58.527
I have to show a place
today, or I'm gonna lose

33:58.570 --> 33:59.491
my best client.

33:59.530 --> 34:01.669
It's a pocket listing;
nobody's gonna know.

34:01.700 --> 34:04.134
Too rislq. Not a good idea.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.660
Fine, then. Keep them.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.109
Sorry I asked.

34:07.140 --> 34:09.529
I know you've been lying to us.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.639
You never
dated Mycroft.

34:11.680 --> 34:14.274
As far as I can tell,
you never even knew him.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.742
I...
Listen, Lin,

34:15.780 --> 34:18.442
I know, so please
tell me the truth.

34:18.490 --> 34:20.117
How did you know about him?

34:20.150 --> 34:22.653
About me and
Sherlock.

34:22.690 --> 34:25.659
What made you think
to come here?

34:25.690 --> 34:27.658
How's this for the truth?

34:27.690 --> 34:29.692
I'd rather take my chances
on my own

34:29.730 --> 34:31.561
than spend another minute
living here with you.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.765
(door opens)

34:40.770 --> 34:42.772
Some of my guys wanted
to send you a gift basket.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.641
They were really
sick of that van.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.443
Could've spared us
all the cloak and dagger

34:46.480 --> 34:48.675
by just explaining why you were
confiscating the footage.

34:48.720 --> 34:51.211
Anything I said
would've been a lie,

34:51.250 --> 34:52.888
so it seemed better
not to say anything.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.457
"Omission is _
the most powerful form of he."

34:55.490 --> 34:58.254
Yeah, we get a lot of George
Orwell quotes around here.

34:58.290 --> 35:01.623
Uh, I'm a fan of "Four
legs good, two legs bad."

35:01.660 --> 35:03.628
I'm guessing you're
not here to wax poetic

35:03.660 --> 35:05.469
about 20th
century authors.

35:05.500 --> 35:08.139
I find nothing poetic
about a government agency

35:08.170 --> 35:10.365
watching passively
as two Turkish agents

35:10.400 --> 35:12.709
rob, maim and murder
American citizens.

35:12.740 --> 35:14.731
You mean the Celik brothers.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.669
You expect me to believe
that the NSA is surveilling them

35:17.710 --> 35:19.769
because they are not spies?

35:19.810 --> 35:22.142
I'm sorry. You said two agents.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.374
There's three.

35:23.420 --> 35:26.583
The brothers
and-and their boss,

35:26.620 --> 35:29.714
who you actually met.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.887
You just didn't know it.

35:33.360 --> 35:34.827
The dealer from the game.

35:36.630 --> 35:39.224
Oh, we've been on
them for months.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.239
Bank statements, video of the
store, audio of their homes.

35:42.270 --> 35:43.589
It wasn't enough.

35:43.640 --> 35:44.902
They're careful.

35:44.940 --> 35:46.737
We didn't know

35:46.770 --> 35:48.169
that they had robbed that game

35:48.210 --> 35:49.837
or killed that kid
until you came along.

35:49.880 --> 35:51.700
And yet when those things
were brought to your attention,

35:51.750 --> 35:52.842
you did nothing.

35:52.880 --> 35:54.518
There was
nothing to do.

35:54.550 --> 35:55.676
Nothing that we
caught on tape

35:55.720 --> 35:57.210
would've gotten you
an indictment,

35:57.250 --> 35:59.582
so why blow our cover?

35:59.620 --> 36:01.679
Frankly, the US. government
has bigger fish to fry

36:01.720 --> 36:03.187
with Szofi Demir.

36:03.220 --> 36:04.824
We don't know
what kind of op

36:04.860 --> 36:06.748
that robbery is
meant to finance

36:06.790 --> 36:08.792
or who she's really working for.

36:08.830 --> 36:11.298
We have a highly placed source
who's confident

36:11.330 --> 36:12.695
that she's a
double agent.

36:12.730 --> 36:14.834
The identity of her new
employer is unclear.

36:14.870 --> 36:16.838
So we thought it would be
better, we'd learn more

36:16.870 --> 36:19.259
if we left her on the street
a while longer.

36:19.310 --> 36:21.505
Give me the ﬁles.
You'll have your answers,

36:21.540 --> 36:23.929
and the NYPD will close the case
within a matter of days.

36:23.980 --> 36:25.902
See, that's the thing.
We don't have days.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.838
After you visited
the smoke shop,

36:27.880 --> 36:30.314
Szofi and her pals
requested extraction.

36:30.350 --> 36:33.615
They're on a flight to
Istanbul in seven hours.

36:33.650 --> 36:35.208
Congratulations, Holmes.

36:35.260 --> 36:37.785
You just helped three spies
get away with murder.

36:44.700 --> 36:46.429
WATSON: I think I know why
the NSA gave us the footage

36:46.470 --> 36:47.698
of the robbery back;
there's nothing in here

36:47.730 --> 36:48.697
that we don't already know.

36:48.740 --> 36:51.334
Still, good to be reminded

36:51.370 --> 36:53.361
of the dangers of bashing your
friends with Hungarian weapons.

36:53.410 --> 36:55.275
Is it just me or

36:55.310 --> 36:58.438
are Szofi and the Celik brothers
awfully careless for spies?

36:58.480 --> 37:01.847
I wish I was in a position
to judge them more harshly.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.518
But absent
the discovery

37:03.550 --> 37:05.279
of fresh evidence,
it appears that they are

37:05.320 --> 37:07.618
three and a half hours from
besting us, and I shall be back

37:07.650 --> 37:10.357
to the olfactory grind
of sniffing out wine fraud.

37:10.390 --> 37:12.426
Is that why you've been brushing
your teeth for half an hour?

37:12.460 --> 37:15.850
Mm-hmm. I will be unable to
sully my sinuses with fluoride

37:15.900 --> 37:18.027
_ and flavorants
until that case is complete.

37:18.060 --> 37:21.029
_ I do not intend _to fail
in my duties twice in a row.

37:21.070 --> 37:23.959
Well, maybe they will beat us,
but it'll be an ugly win.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.308
I mean, their
little fund-raiser

37:25.340 --> 37:26.307
was a mess.

37:26.340 --> 37:27.602
Szofi got hurt,

37:27.640 --> 37:29.437
thelookout
was killed.

37:29.480 --> 37:32.040
Don't forget how inefficient
the entire enterprise was.

37:32.080 --> 37:34.640
They had to use half their haul
on a frame-up because they chose

37:34.680 --> 37:38.787
to rob a game with such...
dangerous players.

37:40.690 --> 37:43.409
Oh. You could
just ask me to move.

37:43.460 --> 37:46.020
Move, please.

37:46.060 --> 37:48.927
What if Szofi and her stooges
aren't as...

37:48.960 --> 37:51.895
reckless as we thought?

37:51.930 --> 37:53.989
Looks pretty reckless
to me.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.335
There.

37:57.370 --> 37:58.507
Still there.
What's still there?

37:58.540 --> 37:59.609
Proof.

37:59.640 --> 38:01.471
That the robbery
was not designed

38:01.510 --> 38:04.070
to fund some heretofore
unidentified scheme.

38:04.110 --> 38:08.001
It was designed to conceal some
heretofore unidentified scheme.

38:09.680 --> 38:12.581
Boy, that's tough to watch.

38:12.620 --> 38:14.349
Yes, it is.

38:14.390 --> 38:17.518
Why would you bring me here
and make me relive this?

38:17.560 --> 38:19.881
And who is this man?

38:19.930 --> 38:21.693
I'm not a friend.
HOLMES: He's here because

38:21.730 --> 38:24.028
espionage doesn't fall in
the jurisdiction of the NYPD.

38:24.060 --> 38:26.324
But you already knew that,
Szofi.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.736
WATSON: The robbery
wasn't about the money.

38:28.770 --> 38:30.397
It was kabuki theater,
a distraction

38:30.440 --> 38:32.032
from what was
really happening.

38:32.070 --> 38:34.504
Which was?

38:34.540 --> 38:36.929
Keep your eye on the keys.

38:36.980 --> 38:38.072
Here,

38:38.110 --> 38:39.907
and then again...

38:39.950 --> 38:41.872
here.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.717
Aside from the set
of keys

38:43.750 --> 38:45.115
he makes a show of stealing,

38:45.150 --> 38:46.947
he only moves
one other set of keys.

38:46.990 --> 38:49.379
The whole purpose
of this robbery

38:49.420 --> 38:51.081
was to create a wax impression

38:51.120 --> 38:54.726
of a key which opens
the server room at Semper Apex.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.354
You had to do that
without alerting the key's owner

38:57.400 --> 38:59.368
that you'd compromised
his business.

38:59.400 --> 39:01.368
Semper Apex?

39:01.400 --> 39:02.628
I'm unfamiliar.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.035
Yes, you are.

39:04.070 --> 39:05.560
The machines inside

39:05.610 --> 39:07.134
Mateo Pea's closet facilitate

39:07.170 --> 39:09.479
diplomatic communications
for half a dozen countries.

39:09.510 --> 39:11.876
You can't get so much as a
Wi-Fi signal in or out of there

39:11.910 --> 39:13.104
unless you have a key.

39:13.150 --> 39:17.712
This is an interesting theory,
but I have a plane to catch.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.978
I'm traveling with friends.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.544
It's not a theory.

39:20.590 --> 39:22.808
Your friends visited Semper Apex

39:22.860 --> 39:25.055
the day after the robbery.

39:25.090 --> 39:27.058
WATSON:
They posed as clients.

39:27.090 --> 39:29.058
And in the middle
of Mateo's sales pitch,

39:29.100 --> 39:31.523
Vural stepped out
to take a call.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.526
He then used his duplicate key
to slip in

39:33.570 --> 39:35.060
and plant this.

39:35.100 --> 39:36.636
HOLMES:
It's a ghost jack.

39:36.670 --> 39:39.400
The LP. address
which it was slaved to

39:39.440 --> 39:41.704
does not belong to the Celiks
or to the Turkish government.

39:41.740 --> 39:43.105
It belongs to you.

39:47.150 --> 39:51.041
The NYPD doesn't care about
who reads Uzbekistan's e-mails.

39:51.080 --> 39:52.980
You want the person

39:53.020 --> 39:54.988
who killed Ian Walker,
and I don't want to see

39:55.020 --> 39:57.113
the inside of a courtroom.

39:57.160 --> 39:59.583
Maybe we can make a deal.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.758
Maybe, but I'm not with
the NYPD, and these guys

40:02.800 --> 40:04.893
can't entertain a deal without
you first gomg on record

40:04.930 --> 40:07.023
about what it is you do
and who you do it for.

40:07.070 --> 40:09.163
And I'm not
talking about Turkey.

40:09.200 --> 40:11.430
Who's your real boss?

40:13.810 --> 40:15.630
Don't say it. Write it down.

40:17.580 --> 40:18.604
Not everyone needs to know.

40:22.720 --> 40:24.711
HOLMES:
No, that's not what I said.

40:24.750 --> 40:26.741
I did not claim to be able
to read her penmanship

40:26.790 --> 40:29.088
from across the room; what I
observed were her pen strokes.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.179
Oh. So now you can make out
what someone's writing

40:31.220 --> 40:33.688
by watching the top of their pen
bob all around?

40:33.730 --> 40:35.925
The top is connected to the
bottom, and I know what I saw.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.928
I just don't see why someone
would develop a double agent

40:37.960 --> 40:39.188
in Lower Manhattan.

40:39.230 --> 40:40.868
I suppose they're ambitious.

40:40.900 --> 40:44.063
No country wants an economy
dependent on goat meat forever.

40:44.100 --> 40:45.567
I have an errand.
I'll meet you at home.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.599
(sneezes)

40:47.910 --> 40:49.878
I don't have a cold.
There was dust in there.

40:49.910 --> 40:51.571
Yes, you keep
telling yourself that.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.477
You'd be wise to pencil in
some time on the trampoline.

40:56.780 --> 40:58.213
LIN: It's the little things
you can't even see

40:58.250 --> 40:59.717
that end up killing you.

40:59.750 --> 41:01.217
And, trust me, copper pipes

41:01.250 --> 41:02.717
beat galvanized
across the board.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.216
So worth it.

41:04.260 --> 41:05.750
Aanay, don't hesitate
to call.

41:05.790 --> 41:07.257
I have a ton
of other listings

41:07.290 --> 41:09.053
if you want
something less modern.

41:09.100 --> 41:10.920
Thanks again for coming by.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.268
I'm working.

41:14.300 --> 41:17.030
At least I'm not crashing
in here with a gunshot wound

41:17.070 --> 41:18.867
and a wad of stolen cash.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.263
We're gonna clear
some things up.

41:20.310 --> 41:22.870
First, I'm not crazy.
You lied about knowing Mycroft.

41:22.910 --> 41:25.970
Are you calling me a liar?
That is not a question.
I am stating a fact.

41:26.010 --> 41:27.978
Okay.

41:28.010 --> 41:30.012
I didn't know Mycroft. So what?

41:30.050 --> 41:32.644
So everything else
about your story was true.

41:32.690 --> 41:34.180
Why lie about that?

41:34.220 --> 41:37.257
Maybe I did it to annoy you.

41:37.290 --> 41:39.224
I think that's partly true.

41:39.260 --> 41:42.752
Which is weird,
because you don't even know me.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.529
Right? The other day,

41:44.570 --> 41:46.526
you called your mother
from one of our burners.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.936
I checked the listing.
It was her home line.

41:48.970 --> 41:50.164
Jing-Mei Wen.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.566
She sure is _
all over soaal media.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.238
Posts tons of
sweet childhood photos of you.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.532
A few friends commented

41:57.580 --> 41:59.707
on how much fun they used
to have at Mrs. Yun's house.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.069
That used to be your name, too.

42:01.110 --> 42:03.112
Did you know
that the name Yun

42:03.150 --> 42:05.948
dates back to the Qing Dynasty?

42:05.990 --> 42:09.187
I do, because,
before my stepfather adopted me,

42:09.220 --> 42:11.518
I was Joan Yun.

42:13.130 --> 42:15.121
Why don't you just admit
you're my half-sister?
