00:10.180 --> 00:11.910
You guys have all your assignments for today.

00:12.170 --> 00:15.090
Oh, and don't forget that tonight is Game Night.

00:15.360 --> 00:17.040
Ah yeah! Game Night!

00:17.040 --> 00:17.800
What are we playing?

00:17.880 --> 00:19.160
Yeah, Skips, what are we playing?

00:19.440 --> 00:22.040
Tonight, we will be playing Drawsome.

00:23.320 --> 00:26.430
Alright. I love me some Drawsome.

00:26.740 --> 00:30.320
Who else is showing up to this Drawsome event?

00:30.500 --> 00:31.930
I got a giant baby,

00:32.110 --> 00:34.230
Gary, and my cousin, Quips.

00:35.780 --> 00:36.230
What?

00:36.450 --> 00:38.490
Your cousin Quips is really annoying.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.730
Yeah, man, he's always telling lame jokes.

00:40.850 --> 00:42.530
What are you guys talking about?

00:42.750 --> 00:44.310
Come on, every other word out of that

00:44.310 --> 00:46.440
guy's mouth is some annoying joke.

00:46.440 --> 00:48.350
Yeah, some joke that isn't funny.

00:48.500 --> 00:51.400
Come on, guys! His jokes aren't that bad!

00:52.740 --> 00:55.600
And then he said, "Yes, I do!"

00:57.380 --> 01:00.070
Alright, seriously last one, cause I got to go.

01:00.220 --> 01:00.710
What?

01:01.930 --> 01:04.120
Hey wait, I didn't get to finish my punchline!

01:04.700 --> 01:06.820
Aw well, he's probably already heard my routine.

01:07.480 --> 01:11.330
Heeey, who's ready for some funny?

01:11.330 --> 01:12.690
Ugh!

01:12.690 --> 01:15.200
You guys all remember my cousin, Quips.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.520
Hey, Quips.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.100
Hey, Benson. Nice to see ya.

01:18.350 --> 01:19.450
Speaking of "see ya",

01:19.670 --> 01:21.910
what did one ocean say to the other ocean?

01:22.080 --> 01:23.460
"'Sea' ya later!"

01:24.570 --> 01:25.260
I don't get it.

01:25.420 --> 01:28.290
Oh, well, an ocean is a body of water, and a sea is also––

01:28.290 --> 01:29.220
I don't care.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.000
A little more care will get you more hair. Zingo!

01:33.090 --> 01:33.860
Ugh!

01:34.640 --> 01:36.020
Hello, Quips.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.660
Pops, looking good.

01:37.840 --> 01:39.330
In fact, you look amazing.

01:39.530 --> 01:41.880
Just a compliment, don't get a big head.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.230
Oops, too late!

01:43.520 --> 01:45.460
Zammo!

01:46.150 --> 01:47.930
And of course Muscle Man, you love the jokes,

01:48.010 --> 01:50.470
why do seagulls fly over the sea?

01:50.960 --> 01:54.370
Because if they flew over the bay, they'd be Bay-gulls!

01:55.340 --> 01:57.090
I got a whole bait about bodies of water.

01:57.460 --> 01:58.700
What? You say you want another one?

01:58.760 --> 02:00.530
We didn't say anything.

02:00.640 --> 02:02.480
What did the lake say to the puddle?

02:03.120 --> 02:05.550
Come on, Quips. Let's get you unpacked.

02:05.940 --> 02:07.790
You probably want to lie down after your trip.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.240
Guess it's time to get this comedy show on the road.

02:10.410 --> 02:13.710
And by comedy show, I mean me! Zingo!

02:13.930 --> 02:15.850
Dude, he's even worst then last time.

02:15.900 --> 02:18.930
Yeah Skips, tell your cousin that if he can't stop telling jokes,

02:18.930 --> 02:20.000
then he's gotta get outta here.

02:20.210 --> 02:22.830
I can't just do that! I invited him here.

02:22.990 --> 02:24.620
No one told you to get rid of your brother

02:24.620 --> 02:25.780
Down when he visited.

02:25.880 --> 02:27.270
That's because everyone loved him!

02:27.270 --> 02:28.680
I tried to get rid of him!

02:29.030 --> 02:32.200
Ugh! Alright fine, I'll tell him soon.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.590
Wow guys, those coughs sound pretty serious.

02:36.800 --> 02:37.880
You guys should see a doctor.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.300
Oh, that reminds me, why did the clown go to the doctor?

02:41.660 --> 02:43.640
He was feeling a little funny!

02:45.280 --> 02:47.510
I set up the extra cot for ya.

02:47.570 --> 02:48.820
Make yourself at home

02:49.040 --> 02:52.620
Could I also make myself 6 feet tall and handsome? Zingo!

02:52.910 --> 02:55.640
Look Quips, I gotta tell you something.

02:55.880 --> 02:57.730
Wait, I need to tell you something.

02:58.130 --> 03:00.380
I just really appreciate you letting me hang out, Skips.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.210
Uh-huh.

03:01.380 --> 03:03.210
I actually got fired from the comedy club,

03:03.370 --> 03:05.260
and I needed to hang out with family and friends.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.950
This weekend is really gonna help me get my confidence back.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.910
Sorry. Didn't mean to get so serious.

03:12.530 --> 03:14.030
Don't worry! I'm gonna take a walk

03:14.030 --> 03:15.260
and come back funnier than ever.

03:15.630 --> 03:16.770
Zingo!

03:19.060 --> 03:21.470
Whoo's ready for some Drawsome?

03:21.470 --> 03:23.700
Drawsome! Whoo!

03:23.700 --> 03:25.620
I brought my pencil.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.740
Gimme somethin' to right on, man!

03:29.240 --> 03:31.040
Wait, did you talk to your cousin?

03:31.120 --> 03:32.880
I...uh...

03:32.920 --> 03:33.760
Knock, knock!

03:33.960 --> 03:35.140
Who's there?

03:35.240 --> 03:35.920
Radio!

03:36.860 --> 03:38.090
You're supposed to go "Radio, who?"

03:38.500 --> 03:39.960
Radio, who?

03:40.060 --> 03:43.600
"Radio" not, here I come! Zingo!

03:44.020 --> 03:45.440
It's funny cuz' I said "Zingo!" at the end.

03:45.830 --> 03:47.380
And I see you brought a #2 Pencil.

03:47.580 --> 03:49.480
Do pencils even go #Number 2?

03:49.700 --> 03:51.480
Maybe after too many beans.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.720
Do pencils even eat beans?

03:54.720 --> 03:56.690
I mean, am I right, guys? What that all about?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.780
So, who's ready to get started? You guys all in?

04:03.360 --> 04:04.460
Wait here, just a second.

04:05.930 --> 04:07.960
Wait! You guys can't leave!

04:08.190 --> 04:09.150
Yes, we can.

04:09.280 --> 04:13.270
There's no way I'm playing "Drawsome" with that flop factory!

04:13.410 --> 04:15.210
Yeah! He's not funny.

04:18.310 --> 04:19.740
Wait, Mordecai and Rigby!

04:19.930 --> 04:23.070
You guys have to stay! You know you owe me.

04:25.000 --> 04:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:35.100 --> 04:37.120
Alright, I guess we'll stay.

04:40.010 --> 04:42.490
Hey, you guys puttin' up paper?

04:42.590 --> 04:43.140
Yeah.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.700
What did the guy paper, say to the girl paper,

04:45.700 --> 04:46.870
when he picked her up for a date?

04:48.180 --> 04:52.200
I like your pad. Get it? Like a pad of paper!

04:54.850 --> 04:56.030
Hello.

04:56.100 --> 04:57.190
Aw, dip!

04:57.190 --> 05:01.040
Whoo! Yeah! This dip is great!

05:01.130 --> 05:02.280
What's your secret?

05:02.280 --> 05:04.760
A cosmic chef, never reveals his methods.

05:04.760 --> 05:06.870
Hey, have you heard the one about the chef in space?

05:07.310 --> 05:10.680
He was famous for his spaghetti and "meteorballs".

05:11.500 --> 05:12.370
Meteorballs?

05:13.450 --> 05:14.670
Yeah, I'm still working on it.

05:15.540 --> 05:20.520
Uh, okay everyone. Let's get this game night rolling.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.720
Uh, lobster!

05:24.720 --> 05:25.240
Crustacean!

05:25.240 --> 05:25.760
Shrimp!

05:29.730 --> 05:30.530
Jumbo Shrimp!

05:30.610 --> 05:31.120
Yes!

05:33.210 --> 05:34.220
Go, Gary, Go!

05:36.540 --> 05:38.280
Is that Pops?

05:38.900 --> 05:39.770
Oh, villain!

05:39.880 --> 05:40.830
Your mom?

05:41.810 --> 05:43.320
Your mom's boyfriend?

05:43.490 --> 05:44.410
Time's up!

05:45.420 --> 05:47.930
Man in the moon! It was "Man in the moon"!

05:47.930 --> 05:49.270
Wow! For real?

05:49.540 --> 05:52.700
I really thought that was your mom's boyfriend. Zingo!

05:54.900 --> 05:56.280
How you catch a unique lion?

05:56.620 --> 05:59.450
"Unique" up on it. Zingo!

05:59.640 --> 06:01.290
How do you catch a tame lion?

06:01.440 --> 06:04.050
"Tame" way. Zingo!

06:04.050 --> 06:06.420
Dude, is this Game Night or Lame Night?

06:06.580 --> 06:09.650
Yeah, we came here to play Drawsome, not listen to jokes!

06:09.720 --> 06:12.910
Guys, guys! Call me crazy, but maybe if you laughed more,

06:12.910 --> 06:13.820
you'd have a better time.

06:14.110 --> 06:16.100
And maybe, you'll even draw better.

06:16.220 --> 06:17.830
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

06:17.830 --> 06:19.320
You're on our team, remember?

06:19.440 --> 06:22.200
Yeah, are you trying to make us lose?

06:22.280 --> 06:24.810
It's just a game, Reggie. Hey, that reminds me!

06:25.170 --> 06:27.040
Why can't you play games in the jungle?

06:27.690 --> 06:30.000
Because there's always gonna be a cheetah!

06:30.160 --> 06:32.150
Just take the game seriously!

06:32.270 --> 06:35.140
Hey, Quips. Try not to upset Reginald.

06:35.280 --> 06:36.820
Aw, why would I want to upset the little guy?

06:37.060 --> 06:40.040
He gets upset if people don't take the game seriously.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.530
I hear you, loud and clear Skips.

06:41.600 --> 06:44.540
Good. Okay, Reginald. You're up.

06:44.680 --> 06:45.810
Good luck, Reggie!

06:46.600 --> 06:50.240
I don't need luck. I was a communications major.

06:54.550 --> 06:55.070
Bacon?

06:55.450 --> 06:55.750
Bacon.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.900
He just said that!

06:58.100 --> 06:59.140
Uh, bacon!

06:59.280 --> 07:00.650
It isn't bacon!

07:00.650 --> 07:04.000
C'mon! Are you sure its not bacon? Zingo!

07:04.060 --> 07:04.690
Time!

07:04.890 --> 07:08.400
Fire engine! It is a fire engine!

07:08.510 --> 07:11.360
You would have got it if you didn't keep guessing "bacon"!

07:11.620 --> 07:14.450
But guessing "Bacon" is way funnier than guessing "Fire Engine."

07:14.810 --> 07:16.870
Look, it got a side of eggs.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.310
That is a Dalmatian!

07:19.200 --> 07:20.080
Dalmatian?

07:20.080 --> 07:22.630
I majored in communications!

07:22.800 --> 07:24.630
Maybe it's time for a refresher course,

07:24.630 --> 07:26.260
cuz' all you're communicating here is that

07:26.260 --> 07:29.440
you don't know how to draw a Dalmatian. Zingo!

07:29.490 --> 07:33.770
What?! No one tells me that I need a refresher course!

07:33.870 --> 07:35.480
That was a bit harsh, Quips.

07:35.630 --> 07:38.590
"Drawsome" is supposed to be a safe space, free of judgement.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.590
Aw. Is Baby upset?

07:40.910 --> 07:43.310
Is he gonna call the "Waahmbulance"?

07:43.310 --> 07:45.220
How dare you!

07:45.220 --> 07:46.570
Whoa, whoa! Okay buddy.

07:46.870 --> 07:47.900
You were right, Skips,

07:48.110 --> 07:50.590
he does get upset when people don't take the game seriously.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.470
Maybe somebody should tell him it's just a game. Zingo!

07:54.470 --> 07:55.710
SILENCE!

07:58.830 --> 08:00.060
Skips!

08:02.660 --> 08:04.370
Smooth move, Quips

08:04.540 --> 08:05.940
He missed out on a great punch line.

08:08.910 --> 08:10.210
Hey Reginald, you might wanna

08:10.210 --> 08:11.760
get some help for your anger issues.

08:12.030 --> 08:13.350
It could lead to high blood pressure.

08:13.480 --> 08:15.440
That's a dangerous health risk for a baby.

08:15.590 --> 08:17.790
I DO NOT HAVE ANGER ISSUES!

08:19.790 --> 08:21.420
Just take a deep breath, man.

08:21.590 --> 08:23.450
We're all just here to draw some pictures.

08:23.560 --> 08:25.450
Quips, you gotta stop!

08:25.530 --> 08:28.140
I haven't been this claustrophobic since before I was born.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.140
Talk about a "womb with a view."

08:30.610 --> 08:32.490
At least he's not closin' the walls in on us.

08:32.490 --> 08:34.250
Great idea!

08:36.960 --> 08:40.200
Aw, why did you say that? We're gonna get crushed!

08:40.370 --> 08:41.190
It was a joke.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.980
Skips, Skips!

08:48.390 --> 08:52.100
Somebody woke up on the wrong side of the crib. Zingo!

08:53.480 --> 08:55.710
Calm down, man. Have some 7-layer dip.

08:55.810 --> 08:58.310
Jeez. I didn't mean to get you all "rattled"!

08:58.990 --> 09:00.710
Skips! Did you see what I did there?

09:00.790 --> 09:03.940
I used "Rattle"! Can't this guy take a joke?

09:03.940 --> 09:07.060
Ok, Funnyman! If you're so fond of your jokes,

09:08.410 --> 09:10.290
why don't you listen to some of your own?

09:11.760 --> 09:14.020
Where do sheep go to get their haircuts?

09:14.020 --> 09:16.020
To the "baa-baa" shop.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.560
Why was the broom late for school? It "over-swept".

09:19.560 --> 09:21.620
How do you catch a fish on your computer?

09:21.890 --> 09:23.280
With the "Inter-Net".

09:23.540 --> 09:24.900
This guy is pure gold!

09:25.130 --> 09:27.350
Don't worry, Skips. I'll just tell Reggie some more jokes.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.350
What? What are you talking about?

09:29.430 --> 09:31.500
Seriously. As soon as I get him laughing,

09:31.500 --> 09:33.010
he'll let us out for an encore.

09:33.010 --> 09:35.370
He's not gonna laugh at your jokes!

09:35.370 --> 09:36.000
Sure he will!

09:36.350 --> 09:38.440
Maybe he just has a problem with understanding them.

09:38.440 --> 09:41.140
THE BABY IS NOT THE PROBLEM HERE, YOU ARE!!

09:41.340 --> 09:42.050
What do you mean?

09:42.470 --> 09:44.980
All you do is tell bad jokes!

09:45.060 --> 09:47.090
What?! People love those jokes!

09:47.090 --> 09:48.290
No they don't!

09:48.800 --> 09:50.850
Quips, you're not funny!

09:57.200 --> 09:58.810
Skips, are you alright?

09:59.070 --> 10:00.490
Yeah, I've been worse.

10:02.230 --> 10:04.450
I had no idea that you guys didn't think I was funny.

10:04.660 --> 10:05.920
I thought you all called me "Quips"

10:05.920 --> 10:07.830
because my last name is "Quippenger".

10:08.040 --> 10:11.720
No, it's because your always telling jokes.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.040
Yeah, really bad jokes.

10:13.150 --> 10:17.520
Rigby! Look, Quips, I know you really wanna be a comedian,

10:17.740 --> 10:20.170
but it's just really annoying when you're always

10:20.170 --> 10:22.370
trying out your material on us.

10:23.260 --> 10:25.530
I'm sorry, everybody. I had no idea.

10:25.970 --> 10:28.730
I just really thought you guys all thought I was hilarious.

10:29.550 --> 10:30.940
I wish you had told me this sooner.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.260
That's okay.

10:32.400 --> 10:36.200
This must be why I got fired from the comedy club. Zingo!

10:37.300 --> 10:40.170
Sorry, sorry! Just kidding. I promise I'll stop now.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.710
Actually, I think I know a place

10:42.710 --> 10:45.000
where you're jokes just might work.

10:46.130 --> 10:49.120
Why do clowns love telling jokes?

10:49.540 --> 10:53.850
Because they "nose" what's funny! Zingo!

10:55.620 --> 10:58.060
That's a better audience for him.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.200
Um, yeah.

11:00.305 --> 11:06.387
