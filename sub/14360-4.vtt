WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
You would not.

00:02.085 --> 00:03.420
I would too.

00:03.462 --> 00:05.046
No clothes at all.

00:05.088 --> 00:06.841
Go all the way

00:05.088 --> 00:06.841
across the street

00:06.882 --> 00:08.049
and ring Mrs. Conlin's

00:06.882 --> 00:08.049
doorbell.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.844
Yeah, I would

00:08.091 --> 00:09.844
totally do it,

00:09.885 --> 00:11.470
but you don't

00:09.885 --> 00:11.470
have ten bucks.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.054
Dewey?

00:13.096 --> 00:14.055
Ah-ah-ah.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.474
No underwear.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.559
No clothes at all.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.686
Of course.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.063
What are you doing?

00:22.105 --> 00:23.858
You said no clothes.

00:23.899 --> 00:26.025
I'll be right back, losers.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.074
I never thought he'd do it.

00:33.116 --> 00:34.869
I guess he outsmarted us.

00:34.910 --> 00:36.787
You opened her gate, right?

00:36.829 --> 00:38.246
Of course.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.457
(dog barking)

00:40.499 --> 00:42.459
REESE:

00:40.499 --> 00:42.459
Good dog, good dog...

00:42.501 --> 00:44.879
Go away!

00:42.501 --> 00:44.879
Somebody help! No! No!

So the universe...

01:21.164 --> 01:24.125
can be... finite...

01:24.167 --> 01:26.336
and unbounded...

01:26.378 --> 01:29.130
but if...

01:29.172 --> 01:32.133
Are you... listening?

01:32.175 --> 01:35.136
Oh, my God.

01:32.175 --> 01:35.136
Sara Coleman is so beautiful.

01:35.178 --> 01:39.016
Look at the way she runs

01:35.178 --> 01:39.016
her hand through her hair.

01:39.058 --> 01:40.559
And that smile.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.186
You look at her and you can't

01:40.601 --> 01:43.186
even see anyone else.

01:46.023 --> 01:50.318
Every day...

01:46.023 --> 01:50.318
you do this.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.154
Ask her... out.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.074
Come on, Stevie.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.867
Sara would never go out with me.

01:56.909 --> 01:58.744
She's smart, she's cool,

01:56.909 --> 01:58.744
she's good-looking,

01:58.786 --> 02:01.080
and if we went out together,

01:58.786 --> 02:01.080
it would make me happy.

02:01.121 --> 02:02.664
So therefore,

02:01.121 --> 02:02.664
it will never happen.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.793
I am destined to be the most

02:02.706 --> 02:05.793
miserable person on earth.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.795
Boo...

02:09.838 --> 02:11.172
...hoo.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.591
Shut up.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.593
Look, it's complicated, okay?

02:14.635 --> 02:18.179
You don't just walk up to a girl

02:14.635 --> 02:18.179
and say, "Hey, I like you."

02:18.221 --> 02:19.640
You'd look like an idiot.

02:19.681 --> 02:22.101
You have to know the right way

02:19.681 --> 02:22.101
to say things and...

02:22.142 --> 02:23.852
Sara wants to know

02:22.142 --> 02:23.852
if you like her.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.186
What?

02:23.894 --> 02:25.186
He likes her!

02:25.228 --> 02:27.481
Oh. She likes him, too.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
Remember yesterday when

02:31.234 --> 02:33.194
we were sitting around,

02:33.236 --> 02:35.196
and then we got

02:33.236 --> 02:35.196
a drink of water,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.364
and then we sat

02:35.238 --> 02:36.364
around again?

02:36.406 --> 02:38.199
We should totally

02:36.406 --> 02:38.199
do that again.

02:38.241 --> 02:39.618
Okay.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.120
Look at me.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.120
It's official.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.454
I have a girlfriend!

02:42.496 --> 02:43.789
I'm officially

02:42.496 --> 02:43.789
someone's boyfriend!

02:43.831 --> 02:45.165
Watch this.

02:49.336 --> 02:52.213
I can do that any time I want.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.218
I hate this part.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.139
This where we have to split up

02:57.260 --> 03:00.139
so my family won't see us.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.222
I'll miss you.

03:04.685 --> 03:06.311
You're a really good kisser.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.688
Thanks.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.106
Bye.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.901
"Thanks?"

03:12.943 --> 03:14.235
What does that mean?

03:14.277 --> 03:16.279
What's wrong with the way

03:14.277 --> 03:16.279
I kiss?

03:16.321 --> 03:17.865
Are my lips too wet?

03:17.906 --> 03:19.867
Maybe they're too dry.

03:19.908 --> 03:22.536
I don't see why she couldn't

03:19.908 --> 03:22.536
just return the compliment!

03:22.577 --> 03:25.246
God, I'm the worst

03:22.577 --> 03:25.246
boyfriend ever.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.874
Okay, just calm down.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.333
I'm a good boyfriend.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.086
She wouldn't be my girlfriend

03:28.375 --> 03:31.086
if I wasn't.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.881
I have a girlfriend!

03:33.922 --> 03:35.674
I don't understand.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.259
All I did was take a donut

03:35.716 --> 03:38.259
out of a Dumpster!

03:38.301 --> 03:39.260
How is that stealing?

03:39.302 --> 03:41.262
I had to fight a cat to get it!

03:41.304 --> 03:43.264
Well, the restaurant owner

03:41.304 --> 03:43.264
wants to press charges.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.516
There's nothing I can do.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.143
Look, I know the guy.

03:46.185 --> 03:48.269
He's a bit of a hothead,

03:46.185 --> 03:48.269
but I promise you

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
he'll lose interest

03:48.311 --> 03:50.313
in four or five days.

03:50.355 --> 03:53.067
Four or five days?!

03:53.108 --> 03:56.277
I have to start a logging job up

03:53.108 --> 03:56.277
in Mamu, and I'm late as it is!

03:56.319 --> 03:57.905
It won't be so bad.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.281
Three square meals a day,

03:57.946 --> 04:00.281
courtesy of my wife.

04:00.323 --> 04:02.951
You look like you could

04:00.323 --> 04:02.951
use some home cooking.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.452
What would you

04:02.993 --> 04:04.452
like for dinner?

04:04.494 --> 04:06.329
Chicken or a nice

04:04.494 --> 04:06.329
porterhouse steak?

04:06.371 --> 04:09.290
A porterhouse, I guess.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.001
Oh, you're going to

04:09.332 --> 04:11.001
love her cooking.

04:11.043 --> 04:12.419
Well, thank you.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.139
At first, I had no idea

04:21.344 --> 04:24.139
what was going on.

04:24.181 --> 04:25.891
And then I realized

04:24.181 --> 04:25.891
I was looking

04:25.933 --> 04:27.308
at a 425 requisition form.

04:27.350 --> 04:28.685
(chuckling)

04:28.727 --> 04:32.355
Shelby had filled it out

04:28.727 --> 04:32.355
thinking it was a 428.

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
Oh, this isn't

04:32.397 --> 04:34.274
interesting, is it?

04:35.358 --> 04:36.818
No, wait, it is.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.238
You just need to know

04:36.860 --> 04:39.238
what a 425 form is.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.321
You see, there's a subtle

04:39.279 --> 04:40.321
difference between...

04:40.363 --> 04:41.322
Dewey, how was your day?

04:41.364 --> 04:42.699
I've got a new friend.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.786
His name's Ronnie.

04:42.741 --> 04:45.786
He just moved here.

04:45.827 --> 04:49.248
He's got a Nintendo,

04:45.827 --> 04:49.248
a Playstation and a nanny.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.331
He's really rich.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.376
Oh? Nice to meet

04:50.373 --> 04:53.376
you, Ronnie.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.336
No! He's real.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.338
I can make real friends, too.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.507
Oh, of course you can, honey.

04:57.380 --> 04:59.507
Just don't be too frustrated

04:59.549 --> 05:01.760
if it takes you a little bit

04:59.549 --> 05:01.760
longer than the other boys.

05:01.802 --> 05:04.304
Ronnie is real!

05:07.307 --> 05:09.268
Reese!

05:07.307 --> 05:09.268
What are you doing?!

05:09.309 --> 05:11.186
Malcolm's got a girlfriend.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.729
What?!

05:11.228 --> 05:12.729
Son, is this true?

05:12.771 --> 05:15.565
Reese!

05:12.771 --> 05:15.565
Damn, I was saving that

05:12.771 --> 05:15.565
for report card day!

05:15.607 --> 05:16.733
She's not...

05:16.775 --> 05:19.153
We're just friends.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.946
Malcolm, look at me!

05:20.988 --> 05:22.530
Oh, my God, it's true...

05:22.572 --> 05:24.950
Malcolm, no!

05:22.572 --> 05:24.950
You do not do this yet!

05:24.992 --> 05:27.368
I saw them behind the

05:24.992 --> 05:27.368
7-Eleven, French-kissing.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.620
That's with tongue, Mom.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.413
Don't you want to go to college?

05:30.455 --> 05:32.373
Don't you care

05:30.455 --> 05:32.373
about your future?

05:32.415 --> 05:34.168
Malcolm, you are

05:32.415 --> 05:34.168
not mature enough

05:34.209 --> 05:37.378
to prioritize between homework

05:34.209 --> 05:37.378
and some prepubescent tramp!

05:37.420 --> 05:39.089
Your mother is right, son.

05:39.131 --> 05:42.217
I waited until I was 11

05:39.131 --> 05:42.217
before I kissed my...

05:42.259 --> 05:44.385
Wait, how old are you?

05:42.259 --> 05:44.385
Never mind.

05:44.427 --> 05:48.765
What I'm saying is, it was

05:44.427 --> 05:48.765
a different time back then.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.558
There was a war on.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.558
(doorbell ringing)

05:50.600 --> 05:52.393
I'll get it.

05:52.435 --> 05:53.895
Maybe that's

05:52.435 --> 05:53.895
Malcolm's girlfriend

05:53.937 --> 05:55.438
who's come over for a

05:53.937 --> 05:55.438
little French-kissing.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.815
Who is this girl?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
Mom, don't make

05:56.857 --> 05:58.859
such a big deal out of this.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.401
I didn't tell anyone

05:58.900 --> 06:00.401
because I knew

06:00.443 --> 06:01.903
this is exactly

06:00.443 --> 06:01.903
how you people would react.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.404
This is none of

06:01.945 --> 06:03.404
your business.

06:03.446 --> 06:05.240
It's nobody's business!

06:05.282 --> 06:08.035
It's not a big deal, okay?!

06:11.246 --> 06:12.789
Well, it's not.

06:12.831 --> 06:16.251
And I would appreciate it

06:12.831 --> 06:16.251
if we could just drop it.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.089
This is Ronnie DeMarco.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.676
As you can see, he's real.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.053
Ow!

06:26.094 --> 06:27.346
Hmm...

06:27.386 --> 06:29.430
Interesting.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.725
We'll be in my room.

06:31.766 --> 06:32.934
(door slamming)

06:39.358 --> 06:41.526
I can't believe

06:39.358 --> 06:41.526
how much stuff you have.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.444
Want to play cowboys?

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
Nah, I hate cowboys.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.948
You can have 'em.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.909
Really? Thanks!

06:48.950 --> 06:51.452
No take-backs.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.537
Hey.

06:52.579 --> 06:53.747
Ronnie, would you please

06:53.788 --> 06:56.083
empty the dishwasher for Mommy?

06:56.124 --> 06:57.667
(sighing):

06:56.124 --> 06:57.667
Okay...

06:57.709 --> 06:59.169
Okay.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.754
So, Dewey,

06:59.211 --> 07:00.754
come here, come here.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.256
Ronnie's birthday's

07:00.795 --> 07:02.256
coming up,

07:02.297 --> 07:04.258
and I want to throw him

07:02.297 --> 07:04.258
a surprise party.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.260
But he doesn't know

07:04.299 --> 07:06.260
that many people here

07:06.301 --> 07:07.844
because of the move and all.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.554
And I thought maybe since

07:07.886 --> 07:09.554
you're his first friend

07:09.596 --> 07:11.306
here in the neighborhood,

07:09.596 --> 07:11.306
you could help me.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.849
Okay.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.849
Okay, now,

07:12.891 --> 07:14.475
I want to invite

07:12.891 --> 07:14.475
your entire class.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.186
All 30 kids?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.520
Well, yeah,

07:16.228 --> 07:17.520
isn't that what you do

07:17.562 --> 07:18.897
for your birthday parties?

07:19.898 --> 07:22.276
(whistling)

07:22.317 --> 07:26.154
Oh? What are

07:22.317 --> 07:26.154
we celebrating?

07:26.196 --> 07:29.157
BOTH:

07:26.196 --> 07:29.157
One, two, three, four, five...

07:29.199 --> 07:30.742
Damn it, you get

07:29.199 --> 07:30.742
back here right now!

07:30.784 --> 07:33.161
I wish I was dead!

07:33.203 --> 07:34.662
Sorta.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.373
I was thinking Ronnie

07:34.704 --> 07:36.373
would like

07:36.415 --> 07:38.499
a  Star Wars  theme

07:36.415 --> 07:38.499
for his party.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.585
No, do cowboys!

07:40.627 --> 07:42.003
What?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.003
Cowboys.

07:42.045 --> 07:44.423
He likes cowboys

07:42.045 --> 07:44.423
better than  Star Wars.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.174
Okay, that'll be fun.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.968
(whispering):

07:46.216 --> 07:47.968
Thank you, Dewey.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.143
Oh, Brock...

07:56.184 --> 07:57.518
Vanessa?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.896
You're trembling.

07:57.560 --> 07:59.896
What's wrong?

07:59.938 --> 08:01.356
Chad's getting

07:59.938 --> 08:01.356
suspicious.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.565
You know he's

08:01.398 --> 08:02.565
been asking

08:02.607 --> 08:04.525
questions at the orphanage.

08:04.567 --> 08:06.361
We need to get out of here.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.613
And say good-bye to all

08:06.403 --> 08:08.613
that money? I don't think so.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.115
We just need

08:08.655 --> 08:10.115
to bide our time.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.783
How can I trust

08:10.157 --> 08:11.783
you, Brock,

08:11.825 --> 08:13.618
when you haven't even told

08:11.825 --> 08:13.618
Cassandra about us yet?

08:13.660 --> 08:16.537
Have a heart, Vanessa.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.537
The woman's still in a coma.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.165
Coma?

08:18.206 --> 08:20.417
Hey, honey.

08:22.585 --> 08:24.545
I just got back

08:22.585 --> 08:24.545
from the mayor's office.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.007
He thinks he's going to kill

08:24.587 --> 08:27.007
our little real estate deal.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
We can't let him do that!

08:27.048 --> 08:28.758
What about those pictures

08:28.800 --> 08:30.385
of him and the Hastings girl?

08:30.427 --> 08:32.762
They're on their way

08:30.427 --> 08:32.762
to the newspapers right now.

08:32.804 --> 08:34.597
We're going to destroy

08:32.804 --> 08:34.597
the old bastard.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.642
Perfect. Now all we have to

08:34.639 --> 08:37.642
worry about is old man Landers.

08:37.684 --> 08:38.935
CHAD:

08:37.684 --> 08:38.935
Mmm.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.561
VANESSA:

08:38.977 --> 08:40.561
Maybe we should send Largo

08:40.603 --> 08:42.605
to pay him a little visit.

08:42.647 --> 08:45.484
(both chuckle)

08:45.525 --> 08:48.153
What'd I miss?

08:48.195 --> 08:49.446
Mr. Herkabe just called.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.572
He said you got Cs

08:49.488 --> 08:51.572
on your last two tests

08:51.614 --> 08:53.825
and you didn't even turn

08:51.614 --> 08:53.825
in your history paper.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.494
I warned you about

08:53.867 --> 08:55.494
this, Malcolm!

08:55.535 --> 08:57.371
Mom, this has nothing

08:55.535 --> 08:57.371
to do with Sara.

08:57.412 --> 08:58.413
I just forgot.

08:58.455 --> 08:59.998
I'm doing it now, okay?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.756
So, what kind of socks

09:05.920 --> 09:08.756
are you wearing?

09:08.798 --> 09:10.675
Yeah, I like those.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.593
Which shoes are you wearing?

09:12.635 --> 09:13.845
Not the sneakers?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.430
How about your boots?

09:15.472 --> 09:17.432
Your sandals.

09:17.474 --> 09:20.601
God, I, like, totally love

09:17.474 --> 09:20.601
all your shoes.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.688
Yeah, I guess I have homework

09:20.643 --> 09:23.688
to do, too.

09:23.730 --> 09:25.273
You hang up first.

09:25.315 --> 09:27.192
No, you hang...

09:25.315 --> 09:27.192
(dial tone)

09:27.234 --> 09:28.609
Hello?

09:30.153 --> 09:31.779
This is all your

09:30.153 --> 09:31.779
fault, Hal.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.698
You're the one who bought

09:31.821 --> 09:33.698
him that acne medicine.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.116
I thought we were safe.

09:35.158 --> 09:36.701
I mean, he's still

09:35.158 --> 09:36.701
goofy-looking.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.079
His head is like five times

09:36.743 --> 09:39.079
too big for his body.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.498
We shouldn't have to worry

09:39.120 --> 09:41.498
about this with Malcolm.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.500
He's gifted.

09:41.540 --> 09:43.500
He's in genius classes.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.210
Girls aren't supposed

09:43.542 --> 09:45.210
to be interested in him

09:45.252 --> 09:46.836
until he's 28 and

09:45.252 --> 09:46.836
a billionaire.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.005
Well, certain things are

09:46.878 --> 09:49.005
beyond the boy's control, Lois.

09:49.047 --> 09:50.673
It's his genetics.

09:50.715 --> 09:53.634
The girls, they just swoon.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.720
Sorry.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.720
What am I telling you for?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.638
You battle with it every day.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.057
There's nothing we can do.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.641
Oh, yes, there is.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.641
I can ground him.

10:00.683 --> 10:01.893
And I can ground

10:00.683 --> 10:01.893
him again.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.562
And I can keep

10:01.935 --> 10:03.562
on grounding him

10:03.603 --> 10:04.645
until he graduates

10:03.603 --> 10:04.645
from Harvard.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.939
Lois, if we push

10:04.687 --> 10:05.939
too hard,

10:05.980 --> 10:07.648
he's just going to

10:05.980 --> 10:07.648
pull away.

10:07.690 --> 10:09.568
And then we'll have

10:07.690 --> 10:09.568
another Francis on our hands.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.027
Are you blaming

10:09.609 --> 10:11.027
Francis on me?

10:11.069 --> 10:12.487
What? No!

10:12.529 --> 10:13.654
That's what you said.

10:13.696 --> 10:15.282
No, I meant that...

10:15.323 --> 10:18.243
Lois, please, l-let's...

10:15.323 --> 10:18.243
let's not have this veer off

10:18.285 --> 10:21.329
into us somehow

10:18.285 --> 10:21.329
not having sex tonight.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.664
Oh, God!

10:23.706 --> 10:26.501
Why do they do

10:23.706 --> 10:26.501
this to us?

10:26.543 --> 10:28.669
Why can't they learn

10:26.543 --> 10:28.669
from their mistakes?

10:28.711 --> 10:31.672
Do you think they're just

10:28.711 --> 10:31.672
being stupid on purpose?

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
It seems like

10:31.714 --> 10:33.674
the only logical conclusion.

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
When they're grown and they

10:33.716 --> 10:35.843
have families of their own,

10:35.885 --> 10:37.720
we don't have to let

10:35.885 --> 10:37.720
them visit, do we?

10:37.762 --> 10:39.598
Absolutely not, sweetie.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.558
It's just going to be

10:39.639 --> 10:41.558
you and me,

10:41.600 --> 10:42.683
old and shriveled,

10:42.725 --> 10:45.770
alone in a big, empty house,

10:45.812 --> 10:50.358
the only sound the gentle

10:45.812 --> 10:50.358
sucking of the respirator.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.693
And all our money

10:50.400 --> 10:52.693
will be sitting in a bank

10:52.735 --> 10:54.529
helping no one.

10:59.117 --> 11:00.701
You guys seen Sara?

11:00.743 --> 11:01.702
No.

11:01.744 --> 11:02.703
That's weird.

11:02.745 --> 11:03.913
She's two minutes late.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.499
Were you supposed

11:03.955 --> 11:05.499
to meet her here?

11:05.540 --> 11:07.292
Well, no, not exactly.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.709
But it was implied.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.587
Implied?

11:10.629 --> 11:11.879
It's our thing.

11:10.629 --> 11:11.879
It's what we do.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.714
We meet at the water

11:11.921 --> 11:13.714
fountain at 8:00.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.715
We're always

11:13.756 --> 11:14.715
within 30 seconds

11:14.757 --> 11:16.134
of each other

11:14.757 --> 11:16.134
in the lunch line,

11:16.176 --> 11:17.594
and when I get home every night,

11:17.636 --> 11:19.179
I wait four minutes

11:17.636 --> 11:19.179
before I call her.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.555
That's how it's always been.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.722
That's our thing.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.433
Wow.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.810
I didn't know having

11:23.475 --> 11:25.810
a girlfriend was so creepy.

11:25.852 --> 11:26.894
It's not creepy!

11:26.936 --> 11:28.104
This is totally normal.

11:28.146 --> 11:29.105
This is dating.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.649
You spend time

11:29.147 --> 11:30.649
with each other,

11:30.689 --> 11:32.233
get to know

11:30.689 --> 11:32.233
each other's habits.

11:32.275 --> 11:34.194
When you're in a relationship,

11:32.275 --> 11:34.194
you'll understand.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.154
But until then, back off.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.782
I'll just hang out

11:36.196 --> 11:39.782
outside the bathrooms.

11:39.824 --> 11:40.825
Hi, Mrs. DeMarco.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.452
Sorry to bother you,

11:42.494 --> 11:44.829
but the nanny put too much

11:42.494 --> 11:44.829
banana in my smoothie.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.747
Oh, well,

11:44.871 --> 11:46.747
we'll fix that, honey.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.042
(whispering):

11:46.789 --> 11:49.042
I just booked the cowboy.

11:49.083 --> 11:51.378
He's going to be passing out

11:49.083 --> 11:51.378
cowboy hats

11:51.419 --> 11:52.837
and making balloon animals.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.381
Does he do trick-shooting?

11:54.422 --> 11:55.756
Well, if he doesn't,

11:55.798 --> 11:57.050
I'm sure we can find

11:55.798 --> 11:57.050
someone who does.

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
I bet Ronnie'd like

11:57.091 --> 11:59.969
a moonbounce, too.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.146
This relationship is finally

12:07.060 --> 12:10.146
starting to make sense.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.940
For a while, all we did

12:10.188 --> 12:12.940
was fight, then make out.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.693
Then fight, then make out.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.152
But that's all behind us.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.072
We were screaming at each other

12:16.194 --> 12:19.072
five minutes ago.

12:19.113 --> 12:20.948
But now it just feels so right.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.076
Wait. What are you doing?

12:20.990 --> 12:23.076
Where are you going?

12:23.117 --> 12:24.785
Home.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.787
We've been kissing

12:24.827 --> 12:26.787
for two hours.

12:26.829 --> 12:27.997
My face is sore.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.374
Yeah, she's right.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.875
We can't make out all day.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.793
We've both got our own things

12:30.917 --> 12:32.793
to do.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.088
She's so smart when it comes

12:32.835 --> 12:35.088
to these things.

12:35.129 --> 12:36.881
If you're seeing someone else,

12:35.129 --> 12:36.881
just tell me!

12:36.923 --> 12:38.799
What?!

12:38.841 --> 12:40.260
I'm sorry.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.220
I don't know where

12:40.301 --> 12:42.220
that came from.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.805
Look, I got to go home.

12:44.847 --> 12:46.765
I'll call you tonight.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.896
That was pathetic.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.814
You were watching us?!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
Believe me,

12:53.856 --> 12:55.400
it's the last time.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
You know, just because

12:55.442 --> 12:57.110
you have a girl

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
doesn't mean

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
you should act like one.

12:59.028 --> 13:01.615
I don't know what's wrong

12:59.028 --> 13:01.615
with her.

13:01.656 --> 13:02.823
She's driving me crazy.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.285
I freak out, like,

13:02.865 --> 13:05.285
20 times a day.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.621
Dude, you think

13:05.326 --> 13:07.621
about everything too much.

13:07.662 --> 13:10.081
You just got to calm down,

13:07.662 --> 13:10.081
turn off your brain.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.249
It's not that easy.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.251
Sure, it is.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.251
I do it all the time.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.628
Watch.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.504
You can't just

13:14.669 --> 13:16.504
turn off your...

13:16.546 --> 13:18.548
Reese?

13:18.590 --> 13:19.840
Reese?

13:19.882 --> 13:21.760
Whoa...

13:21.800 --> 13:23.344
How long was I out?

13:23.386 --> 13:26.681
BROCK:

13:23.386 --> 13:26.681
And as I pulled her

13:23.386 --> 13:26.681
from the wreckage,

13:26.723 --> 13:30.727
she was so disfigured

13:30.769 --> 13:34.897
that I didn't even know

13:30.769 --> 13:34.897
it was my own sister!

13:34.939 --> 13:37.066
VANESSA:

13:34.939 --> 13:37.066
Don't worry.

13:37.108 --> 13:38.652
Dimitri is the finest

13:38.693 --> 13:40.153
reconstructive surgeon

13:38.693 --> 13:40.153
in the state.

13:40.194 --> 13:42.697
Who's Dimitri?

13:42.739 --> 13:44.741
The head of

13:42.739 --> 13:44.741
Municipal Hospital.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.867
He and Vanessa had an affair

13:44.783 --> 13:46.867
last year, then he...

13:46.909 --> 13:48.911
Shut up in there!

13:51.164 --> 13:53.583
Oh, man, who's got their

13:51.164 --> 13:53.583
assignment on Cambodia?

13:53.625 --> 13:54.875
I need to borrow it.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.878
Where were you... last night?

13:57.920 --> 13:58.879
What?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.508
The  Space 1999  marathon

14:01.549 --> 14:02.883
on the Sci-Fi Channel.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.471
I made you a tunic.

14:02.925 --> 14:06.471
And a hologram badge.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.972
Dabney, I...

14:06.513 --> 14:07.972
Forget it!

14:08.014 --> 14:10.684
I gave it to my

14:08.014 --> 14:10.684
mom's boyfriend.

14:10.725 --> 14:12.143
Thanks for nothing.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.187
Guys, look, I'm sorry.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.896
I've just been...

14:15.938 --> 14:18.692
Sara and I were on the phone...

14:18.733 --> 14:21.110
Never mind, I'm just sorry.

14:22.945 --> 14:25.990
I promise

14:22.945 --> 14:25.990
this won't happen again.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.368
I think I turned a corner

14:26.032 --> 14:28.368
on this thing.

14:28.409 --> 14:31.746
Sara and I were talking,

14:28.409 --> 14:31.746
and, uh, it just came to me.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.083
I think we worked things out.

14:36.125 --> 14:38.127
Can you guys excuse me for

14:36.125 --> 14:38.127
a second? I'll be right back.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.842
He does seem... sorry.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.010
I say we cancel our

14:43.883 --> 14:46.010
vote of censure.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.928
I second that.

14:47.970 --> 14:51.974
After all, he was there for us

14:47.970 --> 14:51.974
after the Arboretum burnt down.

14:52.016 --> 14:54.394
And how can you

14:52.016 --> 14:54.394
look in those eyes

14:54.435 --> 14:56.730
and say no to

14:54.435 --> 14:56.730
anything he asks?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.356
(both sigh)

14:58.398 --> 15:01.901
I think... he's learned...

14:58.398 --> 15:01.901
his lesson.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.453
Okay, only two

15:08.991 --> 15:12.453
invitations left.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.954
Ronnie's going to

15:12.495 --> 15:13.954
have a moonbounce

15:13.996 --> 15:15.248
and a make-your-own-sundae cart.

15:15.289 --> 15:16.332
I'll go.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.751
Maybe you will.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.586
What kind of present

15:17.792 --> 15:19.586
would you bring?

15:19.627 --> 15:20.587
Skateboard.

15:20.628 --> 15:22.213
Excellent choice.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.965
Ronnie already has

15:22.255 --> 15:24.965
a brand-new skateboard.

15:25.007 --> 15:27.886
Why don't you let me

15:25.007 --> 15:27.886
worry about Ronnie?

15:29.303 --> 15:32.265
Sit.

15:32.306 --> 15:33.683
Look at yourself.

15:33.725 --> 15:35.393
They put you on probation.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.770
Probation!

15:36.811 --> 15:38.271
If you do just

15:38.312 --> 15:39.856
one more thing wrong,

15:39.898 --> 15:41.441
they're going to kick

15:39.898 --> 15:41.441
you out of school!

15:41.482 --> 15:43.359
Do you have any idea

15:41.482 --> 15:43.359
how serious this is?

15:43.401 --> 15:45.152
Is this who you

15:43.401 --> 15:45.152
want to be?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.987
You want to be some

15:45.194 --> 15:46.987
little lapdog

15:47.029 --> 15:48.907
who ruins his life

15:47.029 --> 15:48.907
for some girl?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.241
For God's sake, Malcolm,

15:50.283 --> 15:52.410
you beat up a foreign

15:50.283 --> 15:52.410
exchange student!

15:52.452 --> 15:53.994
Poor little Zadoc

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
left his country to get away

15:54.036 --> 15:56.205
from this kind of abuse!

15:57.123 --> 15:58.875
Are you even

15:57.123 --> 15:58.875
listening to me?

15:58.917 --> 16:00.293
Yes, I'm listening!

16:00.334 --> 16:02.796
But you know what, Mom?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.796
I've got bigger problems!

16:02.837 --> 16:04.004
You may not have noticed,

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
but I've been screwing up

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
a lot lately.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.842
All because

16:06.090 --> 16:07.842
of some stupid girl.

16:07.884 --> 16:09.218
I'm on probation!

16:09.260 --> 16:11.596
I beat up a kid

16:09.260 --> 16:11.596
who doesn't even speak English!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.264
I am going through

16:11.638 --> 16:13.264
a lot right now,

16:13.306 --> 16:15.349
and you don't even care!

16:17.560 --> 16:19.103
VANESSA:

16:17.560 --> 16:19.103
We can still

16:19.145 --> 16:20.730
pull this off.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.482
You'll never pass the

16:20.772 --> 16:22.482
DNA test, Vanessa.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.943
And even your lies aren't

16:22.523 --> 16:24.943
going to be enough this time.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.947
But, Brock, if you didn't buy

16:24.984 --> 16:28.947
the mining rights, then who did?

16:28.988 --> 16:31.031
BROCK:

16:28.988 --> 16:31.031
Don't either of you two

16:28.988 --> 16:31.031
see what's going on?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.617
The person who bought

16:31.073 --> 16:32.617
the mining rights

16:32.659 --> 16:34.034
is the same person

16:34.076 --> 16:35.912
who stole Mrs. Bronson's

16:34.076 --> 16:35.912
diamond brooch.

16:35.954 --> 16:37.413
And the person

16:35.954 --> 16:37.413
who ran Nathaniel's car

16:37.455 --> 16:38.748
off the road that night.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.040
That person's name is...

16:40.082 --> 16:41.501
Okay, you're free to go.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
Shh!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.127
Come on, move it!

16:43.169 --> 16:45.296
What? No, no, no!

16:43.169 --> 16:45.296
You can't do this to me.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.714
Just give me five

16:45.338 --> 16:46.714
more minutes!

16:46.756 --> 16:47.674
Let's go.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.049
Wait! No! hang on!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.217
Wait, it was the mayor, right?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.636
No, the Widow Farthington!

16:51.678 --> 16:53.053
And what about

16:51.678 --> 16:53.053
the creepy janitor?

16:53.095 --> 16:54.054
Oh, no, no, no!

16:54.096 --> 16:55.055
His amnesiac brother!

16:55.097 --> 16:56.056
(shrieks)

16:56.098 --> 16:57.266
(door slamming)

16:57.308 --> 16:59.143
(bell ringing)

16:59.185 --> 17:01.061
I didn't understand one word

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
that was said

17:01.103 --> 17:02.730
in the last six hours.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.064
I'm exhausted.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.359
I couldn't sleep all night.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.320
But I finally figured out

17:06.400 --> 17:09.320
what I got to do.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.697
Sara, wait up!

17:12.907 --> 17:15.075
Look, I've done a lot

17:12.907 --> 17:15.075
of thinking,

17:15.117 --> 17:17.077
and we need to talk.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.746
Sara, this just isn't working.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.164
Since I've known you,

17:20.206 --> 17:22.333
I've been nothing

17:20.206 --> 17:22.333
but obsessive and neurotic

17:22.375 --> 17:25.503
and a totally jealous creep

17:22.375 --> 17:25.503
who's way too clingy.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.087
I don't like

17:25.545 --> 17:27.087
what this relationship

17:27.129 --> 17:29.089
has turned me into, so...

17:29.131 --> 17:30.090
I got you this pager.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.885
What?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.885
It's perfect.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.970
See, now we'll know exactly

17:31.926 --> 17:33.970
where the other one is

17:34.012 --> 17:36.096
every second of the day.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.096
No more worry, no more doubt.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.932
We'll finally be able

17:36.138 --> 17:37.932
to trust each other.

17:37.974 --> 17:39.099
It's perfect.

17:39.141 --> 17:41.060
We have to

17:39.141 --> 17:41.060
break up, Malcolm.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.731
I don't think you heard me.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.274
In fact, I'm proposing

17:44.772 --> 17:47.274
the exact opposite of that.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.151
That's what the pager's for.

17:49.193 --> 17:51.153
I'm sorry.

17:51.195 --> 17:54.323
Good-bye.

17:56.158 --> 17:57.159
No.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.704
No! No!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.706
Sara!

18:01.748 --> 18:03.416
(echoing)

18:03.457 --> 18:05.209
You can't break up with me!

18:05.251 --> 18:08.170
Because I am filled with nothing

18:05.251 --> 18:08.170
but love and good feelings

18:08.212 --> 18:10.924
and no anger and no jealousy.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.133
And none of those bad things

18:10.965 --> 18:13.133
that will lead to you

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
not wanting to

18:13.175 --> 18:14.510
be with me!

18:14.552 --> 18:15.636
Okay, fine!

18:15.678 --> 18:17.221
Get out of here!

18:17.263 --> 18:18.723
I don't need you anyway!

18:18.765 --> 18:19.724
I hate your guts!

18:19.766 --> 18:20.808
I never needed you!

18:20.850 --> 18:23.185
No, no, no, no.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.729
I love you!

18:24.771 --> 18:26.146
I always have!

18:26.188 --> 18:27.815
I always will!

18:27.857 --> 18:30.526
We were meant to be together!

18:30.568 --> 18:33.362
I gave you my soul, Sara!

18:33.404 --> 18:34.864
I gave it to you!

18:34.906 --> 18:36.156
My soul!

18:36.198 --> 18:38.034
My soul...

18:38.868 --> 18:41.996

MRS. DeMARCO:

18:56.218 --> 18:57.887
Here you go, sweetheart.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.180
You know, I always thought

18:57.929 --> 19:00.180
you hated cookie dough.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.808
So, are you having a good time?

19:01.849 --> 19:03.183
Yeah, Mom.

19:03.225 --> 19:04.184
Thanks.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
Well, you really

19:04.226 --> 19:06.186
should thank Dewey, too.

19:06.228 --> 19:08.856
He was a big help

19:06.228 --> 19:08.856
in planning all of this.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.192
(laughing):

19:10.149 --> 19:12.192
I got you!

19:12.234 --> 19:13.861
You're dead!

19:15.237 --> 19:16.990
You ruined my birthday!

19:17.031 --> 19:18.491
I hate you!

19:18.532 --> 19:22.161
I've had two sundaes

19:18.532 --> 19:22.161
and four snow cones.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.581
Malcolm, let go.

19:25.623 --> 19:27.500
Come on, come on.

19:27.541 --> 19:30.377
I can't feel my fingers.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
Hey, I'll go get us

19:30.419 --> 19:32.212
some more punch.

19:32.254 --> 19:33.422
How does that

19:32.254 --> 19:33.422
sound, huh?

19:36.843 --> 19:39.219
You know, son, this is

19:36.843 --> 19:39.219
all part of growing up.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.681
You're just going to

19:39.261 --> 19:41.681
have to get used to it.

19:47.561 --> 19:50.314
No, I don't.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.692
I can go back.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.320
I can go back.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.159
What are you doing?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.326
Playing.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.037
I'm going to play.

20:04.078 --> 20:05.872
You can't!

20:04.078 --> 20:05.872
You're too big.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.331
No, I'm not.

20:07.373 --> 20:08.708
I'm going back.

20:08.749 --> 20:09.917
No.

20:09.959 --> 20:11.044
You're too big!

20:11.085 --> 20:12.252
You're going to ruin my party!

20:12.294 --> 20:14.254

20:44.368 --> 20:46.286
Okay, don't panic!
