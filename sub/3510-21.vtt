00:36.717 --> 00:39.756
You are very beautiful,
Nikki Heat.

00:39.954 --> 00:43.358
It is too bad that I
have to kill you now.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.774
Uglier men than you
have tried, Drago.

00:47.015 --> 00:48.423
You have slapped me.

00:49.278 --> 00:50.360
I will not have...

00:50.361 --> 00:52.177
Playing with dolls, are we?

00:52.365 --> 00:53.511
These are action figures.

00:54.078 --> 00:56.473
I am using them to
envision a scene.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.885
I owe a few chapters of
"Frozen Heat" to my editor,

00:59.886 --> 01:01.332
and I've not been
able to write a page.

01:01.384 --> 01:02.655
Maybe a case with Beckett might,

01:02.714 --> 01:04.525
you know, spark something.

01:04.572 --> 01:05.749
She's prepping for a trial.

01:06.546 --> 01:07.203
That the mail?

01:07.204 --> 01:09.324
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thank God Alexis is

01:09.325 --> 01:12.372
finally getting some college
acceptance letters.

01:12.378 --> 01:14.644
Her friends started
getting them weeks ago.

01:17.201 --> 01:18.022
Richard Castle,

01:18.654 --> 01:20.555
what on earth are
you playing at?

01:21.143 --> 01:23.036
I don't want Alexis to
have to live through

01:23.037 --> 01:25.695
that Stanford rejection
nightmare again

01:25.696 --> 01:27.260
so I'm holding the letters.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.509
This way, she gets
them all at once,

01:28.510 --> 01:29.912
and she'll get all the
good news with the bad.

01:30.269 --> 01:33.206
Richard, that is the dumbest
idea you've ever had.

01:33.316 --> 01:34.613
Now you've got to give
her these letters

01:34.614 --> 01:36.560
before she has a
nervous breakdown.

01:36.561 --> 01:38.301
Okay, I will. I will.

01:38.475 --> 01:39.304
Though you have to admit,

01:39.305 --> 01:41.793
watching her have a nervous
breakdown is pretty funny.

01:41.794 --> 01:42.787
Unlike yours.

01:42.984 --> 01:44.783
Now what are we gonna
do about your writing?

01:44.784 --> 01:47.932
Oh, I don't know.
I just need something... different,

01:48.226 --> 01:48.972
something new,

01:49.116 --> 01:50.097
something like...

01:51.711 --> 01:52.664
Severed heads.

01:53.379 --> 01:54.456
Severed heads?

01:54.605 --> 01:57.353
The victim was found shot
to death after midnight.

01:57.629 --> 02:01.031
According to police, his bag
contained three severed heads.

02:01.424 --> 02:03.102
Detective Slaughter, what
can you tell us about...

02:03.103 --> 02:04.370
Get that camera out of my face

02:04.371 --> 02:05.501
before I put a bullet in it!

02:07.338 --> 02:08.946
Oh-ho, mother,

02:09.157 --> 02:10.414
forget severed heads.

02:10.675 --> 02:11.879
I want to meet that guy.

02:12.338 --> 02:13.977
You already have
a muse, darling.

02:13.978 --> 02:16.337
Yes, well, muses are to
provide inspiration,

02:16.338 --> 02:18.243
and right now I
ain't getting any.

02:18.541 --> 02:20.251
So detective Nikki Heat,

02:22.017 --> 02:23.262
meet detective Slaughter.

02:24.191 --> 02:26.513
You know what?
Park that in the conference room.

02:26.618 --> 02:27.255
Thank you.

02:28.797 --> 02:30.989
Hey. Castle, what
are you doing here?

02:31.057 --> 02:32.401
I just haven't seen
you in a few days.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.984
Thought I'd drop by,
see how you're doing.

02:34.094 --> 02:35.302
Thank you. That's so sweet.

02:35.303 --> 02:37.053
Um, I'm great, actually.

02:37.074 --> 02:39.257
The trial prep is
going really well.

02:39.258 --> 02:41.345
I've been getting home
at a decent hour, and...

02:42.074 --> 02:43.167
it's great to see you.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.331
It's good to see you, too.

02:44.445 --> 02:46.931
Hey, listen, do you know
anything about this gang cop

02:46.932 --> 02:47.913
named Slaughter?

02:48.247 --> 02:50.383
The severed-heads homicide,
that's why you're here?

02:51.163 --> 02:51.948
Uh, no. I mean,

02:52.896 --> 02:54.805
just, since you're busy
prepping for the trial,

02:54.806 --> 02:56.708
I just thought I'd look
into this Slaughter guy,

02:56.709 --> 03:00.103
get a sense of who he is for
the background research,

03:00.104 --> 03:01.647
the... the...

03:02.544 --> 03:03.527
Unless that's a problem.

03:04.125 --> 03:05.033
No, not a problem.

03:05.932 --> 03:08.596
Great.
So where would I find him?

03:09.672 --> 03:10.564
Wherever the body is.

03:15.826 --> 03:17.616
Darlin', you might
as well confess.

03:17.950 --> 03:18.862
I know you killed him

03:18.863 --> 03:20.801
so we could spend some
quality time together.

03:21.190 --> 03:23.347
Not if you were the
last man on earth.

03:23.596 --> 03:25.147
Don't think I'm not
up to the challenge.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.047
How about we skip
the macho fantasy,

03:27.071 --> 03:28.360
and I just tell you
cause of death?

03:28.378 --> 03:29.801
Let me guess... lead poisoning?

03:29.802 --> 03:31.115
Three shots to the chest.

03:31.314 --> 03:33.495
Most likely died of blood
loss within minutes.

03:33.496 --> 03:35.705
Always figured Glitch would
end up on this table.

03:36.360 --> 03:37.548
Glitch... it's his street name

03:37.549 --> 03:38.863
on account, he's such a screwup.

03:38.864 --> 03:40.121
You fish the slugs out for me?

03:41.864 --> 03:43.671
Ah. See? You do love me.

03:45.080 --> 03:46.485
.32s, I'm guessing.

03:48.466 --> 03:50.367
- You're talking about the bullets, right?
- Yeah.

03:50.751 --> 03:51.958
Aren't you gonna ask
about the heads?

03:53.061 --> 03:54.931
- Who the hell are you?
- That's Castle.

03:55.108 --> 03:57.129
He's a writer, and he
consults with the 12th.

03:57.315 --> 03:59.214
It's weird.
You can tell they aren't fresh.

03:59.581 --> 04:02.518
You can smell it... formaldehyde
with a soupcon of decay.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.651
Judging from the
dirt in the hair,

04:04.691 --> 04:06.425
I'd say our victim
dug the bodies up

04:06.426 --> 04:07.424
and then cut the heads off.

04:07.458 --> 04:08.895
No kidding, Sherlock.

04:09.098 --> 04:11.778
I already got unis checking
out the local cemeteries,

04:11.814 --> 04:13.504
not that it's any
of your business.

04:13.582 --> 04:15.136
Rick Castle, and
like Laura said,

04:15.137 --> 04:16.660
I work out of the 1-2
with detective Beckett.

04:18.410 --> 04:19.289
Here's the thing...

04:19.781 --> 04:22.340
I was hoping I could ride
along with you on this one,

04:22.341 --> 04:23.852
just for a day or two.

04:23.853 --> 04:24.938
- No.
- No?

04:25.072 --> 04:27.420
I need a writer hanging around
like I need a case of the crabs.

04:27.779 --> 04:28.393
That's...

04:29.719 --> 04:31.229
What could I say to
change your mind?

04:33.492 --> 04:35.578
Well, that is a very fine coat.

04:37.581 --> 04:40.131
And it would look
fabulous on you.

04:49.775 --> 04:50.926
So are we good?

04:51.469 --> 04:52.243
No.

04:52.704 --> 04:53.653
See ya, gorgeous.

04:56.387 --> 04:58.539
You said I could ride along
if I gave you my coat.

04:58.789 --> 04:59.614
I never said that.

04:59.955 --> 05:00.684
It was implied.

05:00.766 --> 05:01.847
Look, I work alone.

05:01.850 --> 05:03.402
Nothing you say is
gonna change that.

05:04.285 --> 05:05.376
I'm friends with the mayor.

05:07.439 --> 05:08.071
Yeah?

05:08.195 --> 05:10.376
And seeing as how I'm asking
you for a favor here,

05:11.566 --> 05:13.111
that would mean I would
owe you one in return.

05:14.665 --> 05:16.472
Well, any friend of the
mayor is a friend of mine.

05:16.508 --> 05:17.392
What's our first move?

05:17.732 --> 05:19.112
Break the news to Glitch's dad.

05:24.711 --> 05:27.485
That was awesome.
Beckett never drives on the sidewalk.

05:27.634 --> 05:28.504
If you're gonna hang with me,

05:28.505 --> 05:29.826
we're gonna lay out
some ground rules.

05:29.959 --> 05:30.689
Rule number one,

05:30.778 --> 05:32.386
do not use the word "awesome."

05:32.658 --> 05:33.489
You're a grown man.

05:34.019 --> 05:35.868
Rule number two,
stay outta my way.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.141
Is that it?

05:37.391 --> 05:38.650
That's kinda all-encompassing.

05:41.435 --> 05:42.898
This is the hardest
part of the job...

05:43.027 --> 05:44.365
breaking the news to the family.

05:44.911 --> 05:47.478
So what's your style,
terse yet compassionate,

05:48.017 --> 05:49.785
- sensitive but strong?
- Brian.

05:50.429 --> 05:51.518
Glitch is in the morgue.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.231
Someone pumped three
rounds into him.

05:56.362 --> 05:57.310
We're sorry for your loss.

05:58.447 --> 05:59.987
My what? My "loss"?

06:00.863 --> 06:02.563
Who the hell are you
to talk about my loss?

06:03.232 --> 06:05.497
Your boy was into something
bad, worse than usual.

06:05.869 --> 06:06.709
What do you know about it?

06:07.634 --> 06:10.009
And why would I tell
ya even if I knew?

06:10.214 --> 06:12.612
Well, it involved cutting
the heads off of dead guys.

06:12.792 --> 06:14.614
Doesn't sound like your
boy's brand of stupid.

06:14.782 --> 06:15.742
My son...

06:16.356 --> 06:18.837
was a simple lad operating
in difficult times.

06:18.976 --> 06:20.896
You disparage his
memory at your peril.

06:21.328 --> 06:21.924
Now...

06:22.229 --> 06:25.510
I've gotta go tell his
mom, make arrangements.

06:29.486 --> 06:30.367
That's a hard man.

06:30.995 --> 06:33.117
Yeah, you don't get to be top
leg breaker in the Westies

06:33.118 --> 06:34.067
by being soft.

06:34.498 --> 06:36.199
No wonder he didn't give
us anything useful.

06:36.200 --> 06:37.060
Never thought he would.

06:38.958 --> 06:40.870
He's a "take the law into
your own hands" kinda guy.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.064
You think he's gonna hunt
down Glitch's killer himself.

06:44.065 --> 06:45.657
Yeah, and we're
gonna follow him.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.466
The tricky part's
gonna be interceding

06:48.467 --> 06:49.670
before he kills the guy.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.273
Let's go. He's on the move.

06:52.778 --> 06:53.593
Where do you think he's going?

06:55.342 --> 06:56.733
I don't know.
That's why we're following him.

07:01.278 --> 07:01.944
Yeah?

07:02.241 --> 07:03.045
Outstanding.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.782
Unis found the cemetery
where Glitch got the heads.

07:05.915 --> 07:07.213
Four blocks from
the crime scene.

07:09.812 --> 07:10.545
Thanks, brother.

07:12.395 --> 07:14.016
When we get back to the office,
we'll run these names down,

07:14.090 --> 07:15.592
find out who these
heads belong to.

07:15.954 --> 07:19.175
Why wait when I can have my
team run them right now?

07:19.329 --> 07:20.186
You got a team?

07:21.748 --> 07:23.006
- Hello?
- I am texting you

07:23.007 --> 07:24.832
three names, all
recently deceased.

07:24.833 --> 07:25.929
I need you to run 'em for me.

07:26.039 --> 07:27.462
Beckett's not working
a case right now.

07:27.615 --> 07:30.236
No, I'm running and gunning
with Slaughter from gangs.

07:30.378 --> 07:31.348
Then have him run the names.

07:31.985 --> 07:32.848
I don't work for you.

07:34.466 --> 07:35.521
Ah, Esposito,

07:35.748 --> 07:36.621
you are too funny.

07:36.968 --> 07:38.078
He's there, isn't he?

07:38.079 --> 07:39.293
- Uh-huh.
- All right.

07:39.643 --> 07:41.864
If you want me to make you
look good, it's gonna cost.

07:42.156 --> 07:43.266
Front-row Knicks tickets.

07:46.847 --> 07:47.516
Sounds good.

07:47.737 --> 07:49.273
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

07:49.352 --> 07:50.152
your boy Slaughter...

07:50.502 --> 07:52.166
he's got quite a
reputation in gangs.

07:53.178 --> 07:54.822
His nickname is
"The Widowmaker."

07:55.230 --> 07:56.801
His last three partners
were all killed

07:57.116 --> 07:57.934
in the line of duty.

08:01.226 --> 08:02.265
- All good?
- Yeah.

08:06.098 --> 08:07.492
You think one of those
guys could be the killer?

08:07.690 --> 08:10.348
Nah, he's just
trolling for info,

08:11.172 --> 08:12.113
which means we watch

08:13.069 --> 08:13.800
and wait.

08:17.979 --> 08:18.960
Ahh. Ah, no, than.

08:21.235 --> 08:21.908
Okay, sure.

08:25.691 --> 08:26.400
So...

08:28.326 --> 08:29.590
they call you The Widowmaker.

08:29.615 --> 08:32.381
Hey, not my fault they keep
sticking me with idiots.

08:33.928 --> 08:34.943
Speaking of partners,

08:35.284 --> 08:37.409
I've seen pictures of yours.
She's smokin' hot.

08:39.172 --> 08:40.160
You're tappin' that, right?

08:40.176 --> 08:41.234
What? No.

08:41.496 --> 08:43.149
No? What's wrong with you?

08:43.357 --> 08:44.775
Nothing's... nothing's
wrong with me.

08:45.014 --> 08:45.802
We're just friends.

08:46.106 --> 08:47.405
Man needs a friend,
he gets a dog.

08:48.126 --> 08:49.503
Woman like that, you
storm the beaches

08:49.504 --> 08:50.753
or die trying. Come on.

08:51.803 --> 08:53.457
He's heading for that bar.
Showtime.

08:59.734 --> 09:00.430
You packin'?

09:01.052 --> 09:04.071
Packing? No, I'm not a cop.
My vest says "Writer" on it.

09:04.102 --> 09:06.382
Rule number three, you ride
with me, you ride strapped.

09:06.739 --> 09:07.398
Come on.

09:09.484 --> 09:11.547
Hey, hey, what
about regulations?

09:11.624 --> 09:12.894
You signed a waiver, didn't you?

09:13.322 --> 09:16.212
Okay, you take the front,
I'll go in the back.

09:16.610 --> 09:19.116
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shouldn't we call for backup?

09:19.132 --> 09:21.047
You got a skirt that says
"Writer" on it, too?

09:21.431 --> 09:22.145
No.

09:22.192 --> 09:24.493
Come on. Give me ten
seconds, then go in hard.

09:24.816 --> 09:26.830
Yell out "NYPD," the
louder, the better.

09:40.772 --> 09:41.742
NPYD!

09:41.863 --> 09:43.833
Associated civilian investigator.
Nobody move.

09:52.348 --> 09:54.270
- Drop the gun, dirtbag!
- What did you call me?

09:54.379 --> 09:55.637
D- dirtbag.

09:56.733 --> 09:58.237
Drop it or your wife
will be getting

09:58.238 --> 09:59.934
a volume discount
at the mortuary.

10:00.106 --> 10:01.816
Come on. Sit down.

10:03.498 --> 10:04.352
Get him, Sherlock!

10:15.943 --> 10:16.768
I got him!

10:16.960 --> 10:18.370
I don't... I don't got him.
I don't got him.

10:18.466 --> 10:19.900
I don't got him.
I don't got him.

10:20.527 --> 10:21.133
Little help!

10:21.418 --> 10:22.312
You're doing fine.

10:35.890 --> 10:37.387
Well done, Sherlock. Attaboy.

10:40.998 --> 10:46.071
Sync & corrections by Anonymous

10:51.017 --> 10:51.931
What's this I hear about Castle

10:51.932 --> 10:53.225
researching with another cop?

10:53.760 --> 10:55.249
Don't you have some
fives to fill out?

10:56.210 --> 10:58.231
I'm sure it's just a phase.
You know Castle.

10:58.232 --> 11:00.363
He's probably caught up
in the severed heads

11:00.379 --> 11:02.319
and the rush of the
gangster squad...

11:02.320 --> 11:03.171
I don't care what...

11:03.172 --> 11:04.151
what...

11:04.211 --> 11:06.369
he's wrapped up in
just so long as he...

11:06.677 --> 11:07.594
stays out of my...

11:08.475 --> 11:10.061
hair. Thanks.

11:24.853 --> 11:26.571
Hey, put him on ice for me, huh?

11:26.618 --> 11:29.000
Shea, keep it in
the family, huh?

11:30.298 --> 11:32.124
- Where's interrogation?
- Right there. First door right there.

11:32.125 --> 11:32.904
Come on, you.

11:36.243 --> 11:37.374
What the hell happened?

11:37.378 --> 11:39.197
Oh, you should have seen it.

11:39.461 --> 11:40.886
Slaughter got the
drop on the one guy,

11:40.887 --> 11:42.325
but the other guy tried
to make a break for it.

11:42.707 --> 11:44.233
I had to take his ass down.

11:44.234 --> 11:46.277
You what? Are you kidding me?

11:46.355 --> 11:48.236
You're a writer, Castle.
Not a cop.

11:48.546 --> 11:50.794
Hey, I can take care of myself.
You just never give me a chance.

11:50.856 --> 11:52.429
Yeah, because I'm not
trying to get you killed.

11:52.430 --> 11:54.466
And what is he doing
using our box?

11:54.713 --> 11:55.671
Well, I invited him to.

11:55.771 --> 11:57.088
Castle, that's not your place.

11:57.094 --> 11:59.568
I didn't think you'd mind.
Besides, guys like Slaughter,

11:59.569 --> 12:01.659
they just float from precinct
to precinct, you know?

12:01.660 --> 12:03.120
They're like nomads,

12:03.673 --> 12:05.397
wandering the streets
of New York City,

12:06.155 --> 12:07.719
kicking ass and taking names,

12:07.908 --> 12:09.782
which isn't the most
original turn of phrase,

12:09.783 --> 12:12.097
but the character is so great.

12:12.538 --> 12:14.636
It's really gonna help me shake
up this next Nikki Heat book.

12:14.647 --> 12:16.561
Yeah, sure, if you
live long enough

12:16.562 --> 12:17.662
to actually write about it.

12:19.685 --> 12:20.560
I didn't kill Glitch.

12:21.313 --> 12:22.834
Then why'd his father
come after you?

12:23.173 --> 12:24.855
I don't know, but you
gotta convince him

12:24.856 --> 12:25.735
that I'm innocent.

12:26.924 --> 12:27.925
No, no, no, no.

12:28.392 --> 12:29.635
You gotta convince me

12:30.298 --> 12:31.599
or I'm gonna park you in holding

12:32.258 --> 12:33.600
then sit back and marvel

12:33.601 --> 12:35.608
at how Brian removes your limbs

12:36.253 --> 12:37.551
with his bare hands.

12:38.009 --> 12:39.895
I was at my sister's house

12:39.917 --> 12:41.561
on long island last night.

12:41.989 --> 12:44.031
You can call and ask her.

12:48.159 --> 12:50.240
So why does Brian think
you killed his son?

12:53.869 --> 12:54.628
Really, Shea?

12:55.491 --> 12:57.497
Want me to bust out Jake
and The Fatman again?

13:06.007 --> 13:08.008
Brian heard me and Glitch
had a falling out,

13:08.009 --> 13:08.823
but we didn't.

13:09.223 --> 13:09.934
It's just...

13:11.278 --> 13:13.403
Finn Rourke told us all
to stay away from him.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.482
The head of the Westies
made you freeze Glitch out?

13:16.498 --> 13:17.147
Why?

13:19.572 --> 13:21.081
He screwed up another
job last week.

13:21.324 --> 13:23.590
He abandoned a truck full
of stolen medical equipment

13:23.591 --> 13:25.695
on the FDR
after he ran out of gas.

13:26.456 --> 13:27.479
The only reason

13:27.604 --> 13:29.876
Finn didn't have Glitch
killed was Brian,

13:30.194 --> 13:31.425
because he knew he
was crazy enough

13:31.426 --> 13:33.517
to go after him if anything
happened to his kid.

13:34.366 --> 13:36.402
Why did Glitch have a
bag full of heads?

13:36.914 --> 13:37.665
No clue.

13:38.091 --> 13:39.381
When's the last
time you saw him?

13:39.629 --> 13:40.516
Two days ago.

13:40.664 --> 13:41.978
He said he was
gonna do something

13:42.076 --> 13:43.748
to get back in good
with the Westies.

13:44.137 --> 13:45.161
Did he say what it was?

13:45.383 --> 13:46.726
No, and I didn't ask.

13:48.997 --> 13:49.755
How could Glitch think

13:49.756 --> 13:51.498
that cutting the heads
off dead bodies

13:51.499 --> 13:53.047
would get him back in
good with the Westies?

13:54.941 --> 13:55.767
He wasn't a deep thinker.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.723
I wouldn't knock myself
out looking for motive.

13:57.942 --> 13:58.660
Cappuccino?

14:00.904 --> 14:01.695
Rule four.

14:02.004 --> 14:02.692
Castle.

14:04.053 --> 14:04.673
Perfect.

14:04.784 --> 14:07.373
Thank you. Thank you very much.

14:08.336 --> 14:09.333
Esposito said

14:09.334 --> 14:10.504
you'd have something for him.

14:17.527 --> 14:18.487
Uh, that's...

14:19.022 --> 14:20.484
Tell him... tell him
they're on their way.

14:21.258 --> 14:21.842
Thank you.

14:22.085 --> 14:22.719
All right.

14:23.090 --> 14:24.828
Looks like we got
IDs on our heads.

14:25.361 --> 14:28.113
All three belong to members
of the Trenchtown posse.

14:28.114 --> 14:30.210
Hot damn. Mystery solved.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.473
- Uh...
- Trenchtown posse,

14:32.474 --> 14:33.970
jamaican gang... runs
girls and drugs

14:33.971 --> 14:35.092
from Brooklyn to the Bronx.

14:35.634 --> 14:37.116
They're fighting a turf
war with the Westies

14:37.117 --> 14:38.227
over the morningside heights.

14:38.874 --> 14:40.661
I bet Glitch thought he
could make his bones

14:40.811 --> 14:43.533
by cutting the heads
off of Westie enemies.

14:43.768 --> 14:45.062
Bet he planned on
putting those heads

14:45.063 --> 14:47.083
in some high-ranking
jamaican beds.

14:48.312 --> 14:50.737
Like a horse's head,
"The Godfather."

14:52.086 --> 14:53.945
Yeah, that's the stupidest
thing you said yet,

14:54.958 --> 14:57.001
and just dumb enough to
seem smart to Glitch.

14:57.002 --> 14:58.423
And knowing that boy,
he'd run his mouth,

14:58.729 --> 15:00.305
Jamaicans hear about it,
and they ambush him.

15:00.306 --> 15:00.987
Come on.

15:03.376 --> 15:05.993
I got a source on the street
tied in with the Jamaicans.

15:05.994 --> 15:07.161
He'll be able to give us intel.

15:07.308 --> 15:09.010
I love this run-and-gun
police work.

15:12.473 --> 15:13.169
You're upset.

15:13.319 --> 15:14.003
No.

15:14.774 --> 15:16.222
Yes. Okay? Fine. Yes.

15:16.223 --> 15:17.239
I thought that

15:17.240 --> 15:19.835
the two of us were actually
getting closer together,

15:19.855 --> 15:21.843
and now it seems like
he's just pulling away.

15:22.385 --> 15:23.640
Have you asked him why?

15:23.641 --> 15:25.082
Yes, and he said...

15:25.101 --> 15:26.333
"Oh, everything is fine."

15:27.405 --> 15:28.468
What makes you think it isn't?

15:28.469 --> 15:30.827
Because he's acting like
a complete jackass!

15:31.247 --> 15:32.512
He shows up at the precinct

15:32.513 --> 15:34.074
with these bimbos
hanging on his arm,

15:34.075 --> 15:35.857
and now he's running
around with another cop.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.263
Is this other cop a woman?

15:37.264 --> 15:38.629
No! No. Why...

15:39.148 --> 15:40.278
why would you even ask that?

15:40.378 --> 15:41.395
That's not even the point.

15:41.396 --> 15:44.953
The point is, I don't understand
why he's acting like this.

15:44.954 --> 15:45.925
I mean, what did I do?

15:47.081 --> 15:48.660
Well, maybe, from
his point of view,

15:48.856 --> 15:51.003
the question is,
what didn't you do?

15:51.225 --> 15:51.879
Wait. What?

15:52.253 --> 15:53.041
W- what do you mean?

15:53.768 --> 15:56.108
When you were shot, Castle
said that he loved you.

15:56.521 --> 15:57.577
How long ago was that?

15:57.578 --> 15:59.880
Seven months ago, but I wasn't
ready to hear that then...

15:59.881 --> 16:01.923
What do you think he's telling
you with his behavior?

16:04.135 --> 16:05.589
That maybe

16:05.590 --> 16:08.707
he's not there anymore?

16:08.708 --> 16:10.335
That maybe he's not ready?

16:20.626 --> 16:22.033
What if I waited too long?

16:23.017 --> 16:25.932
You weren't waiting, Kate.
You were healing.

16:25.933 --> 16:27.201
Yeah, but then in the meantime,

16:27.202 --> 16:28.287
he's moved on.

16:28.804 --> 16:30.293
Or he's protecting himself

16:30.351 --> 16:32.723
by not taking more
emotional risks.

16:34.071 --> 16:35.056
So then what do I do?

16:36.969 --> 16:37.952
What do you want to do?

16:39.746 --> 16:40.847
I tell you what I'd do,

16:41.072 --> 16:43.376
I'd go all caveman on
that partner of yours.

16:43.429 --> 16:45.335
Show her what time it
is in real-man land.

16:45.709 --> 16:46.590
Real-man land?

16:47.575 --> 16:48.742
Oh, is that what you
were showing Laura

16:48.743 --> 16:49.776
when we were back at the morgue?

16:50.342 --> 16:51.979
Just throw a little
attention her way,

16:52.099 --> 16:52.843
make her happy.

16:53.192 --> 16:56.134
You know who I'm mackin'
on is this hot new redhead

16:56.146 --> 16:57.297
just started working there.

16:57.803 --> 16:59.284
That girl's barely street legal.

17:01.037 --> 17:01.760
A redhead?

17:01.826 --> 17:02.466
Yeah.

17:02.467 --> 17:04.319
About 5'5", blue eyes, intern?

17:04.320 --> 17:05.608
Yeah. You know her?

17:06.348 --> 17:07.348
That's my daughter.

17:07.348 --> 17:09.314
Seriously?
That girl got an ass...

17:11.718 --> 17:12.327
Hey.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.357
Relax, Sherlock.
I'm just playin'.

17:16.749 --> 17:17.506
All right.

17:17.953 --> 17:19.777
As long as we're clear that
my daughter's off-limits.

17:20.130 --> 17:23.053
Yeah. You pack a little
punch there for a writer.

17:26.271 --> 17:27.169
There's my guy.

17:35.765 --> 17:36.777
Nah, you stay here.

17:37.361 --> 17:38.072
Keep an eye out.

18:00.286 --> 18:01.513
- You okay?
- I got a name.

18:03.801 --> 18:05.241
What happened in there?
Did you kill him?

18:05.345 --> 18:07.298
You don't want to know.
We were never here.

18:28.807 --> 18:29.921
- What are you doing?
- Jeez!

18:31.607 --> 18:32.304
You okay?

18:33.231 --> 18:34.162
That guy is insane.

18:34.335 --> 18:35.612
Yeah, I know.
I tried to tell you.

18:35.613 --> 18:37.152
No, he's insane.

18:37.602 --> 18:38.360
Why? What did he do?

18:39.924 --> 18:40.587
Jeez!

18:46.855 --> 18:47.720
I can't talk now.

18:51.946 --> 18:52.822
I want those tickets.

18:56.284 --> 18:57.018
Hey.

18:57.529 --> 18:58.248
What's up?

18:58.709 --> 18:59.725
What are you talking about?

18:59.807 --> 19:00.415
Where?

19:01.888 --> 19:02.698
Oh, there. Um...

19:04.033 --> 19:04.688
Nothing.

19:05.764 --> 19:06.932
I mean, obviously, not nothing.

19:07.464 --> 19:10.469
We were talking.
We weren't just moving our...

19:13.443 --> 19:14.395
I gotta go to the bathroom.

19:27.339 --> 19:27.972
Hey.

19:29.703 --> 19:30.397
What the hell?

19:31.177 --> 19:32.166
I thought you killed him.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.268
Yeah, you shoulda seen
the look on your face

19:34.283 --> 19:35.371
when I came out that door.

19:37.598 --> 19:38.407
That's not funny.

19:39.356 --> 19:40.169
That's not funny.

19:40.186 --> 19:42.634
No, no, it's hysterical!

19:51.051 --> 19:53.050
Look at 'em laughing it up.

19:53.388 --> 19:53.958
Okay.

19:54.036 --> 19:55.323
Just acting like
they own the place.

19:56.254 --> 19:57.029
I'm gonna say something.

19:57.030 --> 19:58.648
No, don't. It's not worth it.

20:00.329 --> 20:01.341
I feel like he's cheating on us.

20:01.655 --> 20:03.940
He's not cheating on us, Ryan.
He's just...

20:04.793 --> 20:05.701
branching out.

20:07.028 --> 20:08.296
Don't take it personally, son.

20:08.517 --> 20:09.412
Marc Gibson.

20:09.566 --> 20:11.111
I'm undercover on the
gang task force.

20:11.314 --> 20:12.970
I had to make sure
I could trust ya,

20:13.078 --> 20:14.619
that you had my back
if things got ugly.

20:15.139 --> 20:16.288
Luckily, you passed.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.620
Well, you were right about the
Jamaicans taking out Glitch.

20:19.769 --> 20:20.877
Neighbors near the cemetery

20:20.878 --> 20:22.315
heard gunshots on the
night of the murder.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.485
Source tells me a low-level
banger named Maxi

20:24.486 --> 20:26.063
- was the one doing the shooting.
- Ah.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.658
He's holed up in a building
on Avenue A and 5th.

20:30.626 --> 20:31.715
Take a walk, fellas.

20:32.337 --> 20:32.979
Let's go, man.

20:32.995 --> 20:34.674
Maxi, why you gotta
make this so hard, huh?

20:34.723 --> 20:37.045
We both know you killed
that Westie kid last night.

20:37.046 --> 20:38.108
I want me lawyer.

20:38.555 --> 20:39.273
Your lawyer?

20:39.659 --> 20:41.183
- Sure. He's right in here.
- Uhh!

20:45.331 --> 20:45.839
Wait!

20:45.841 --> 20:47.197
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

20:47.198 --> 20:48.301
Tell me you killed him
or they're gonna have to

20:48.302 --> 20:51.045
- hose you outta here, Maxi.
- I didn't kill no one!

20:52.393 --> 20:53.258
Wait! Wait!

20:53.259 --> 20:55.679
Wait! I got a call
that some Westie boy

20:55.680 --> 20:58.071
was running his mouth about
digging up our dead.

20:58.389 --> 21:00.471
Me go out to the
cemetery to ambush him,

21:00.511 --> 21:02.037
but I never fire no shot!

21:02.790 --> 21:03.705
You better stand back.

21:03.706 --> 21:05.430
This guy's gonna
pop like a grape.

21:06.010 --> 21:07.306
No, wait! I swear!

21:07.437 --> 21:10.107
He wasn't alone!
A group of Mexicans was waiting there

21:10.228 --> 21:11.745
next to a tricked-out escalade!

21:12.171 --> 21:12.857
Are you telling me

21:12.858 --> 21:14.755
a third gang is
involved in this?

21:14.756 --> 21:16.349
Man, I don't know
who they are, man!

21:16.471 --> 21:18.054
But that Glitch
clearly knew them!

21:18.317 --> 21:20.989
He told 'em he had the heads,
then things went south!

21:21.297 --> 21:24.030
The Mexicans opened fire on
him and took off running,

21:24.053 --> 21:26.092
- and so did I.
- Okay, okay, okay,

21:26.093 --> 21:28.319
so the Mexicans hunted down
Glitch, and they shot him.

21:28.325 --> 21:30.164
Or he did and he's
making up a story.

21:30.165 --> 21:31.958
No, no, no, no, no!
I can prove it!

21:32.036 --> 21:34.054
The escalade had Texas plates.

21:34.198 --> 21:37.310
I saw the first two
letters... "R" and "X."

21:37.826 --> 21:38.869
Okay, Maxi.

21:38.918 --> 21:40.333
But that license
better check out,

21:40.334 --> 21:42.423
or I'm gonna come back
here and recycle your ass.

21:42.424 --> 21:43.800
It will check. It will check!

21:43.967 --> 21:45.391
- It'll check, man! I swear!
- Bye-bye.

21:45.460 --> 21:47.404
Slaughter, get me out of here!

21:48.634 --> 21:50.385
Another gang.
That's plausible, right?

21:50.386 --> 21:51.022
Yep.

21:51.718 --> 21:54.122
You threaten enough guys, you
get a feel for their honesty.

21:54.228 --> 21:55.834
But you wouldn't have
really crushed him?

21:55.835 --> 21:56.725
Nah, of course not.

21:56.744 --> 21:58.714
It would've been more
like a-a mangling.

21:59.401 --> 22:00.699
Slaughter! Aah!

22:04.830 --> 22:05.542
Detective Ryan.

22:05.554 --> 22:06.260
Yeah, it's Castle.

22:06.261 --> 22:08.340
I have a partial Texas
plate I need you to run.

22:08.341 --> 22:10.131
First letters "R" and "X."

22:10.594 --> 22:11.701
Yeah, Castle.

22:12.038 --> 22:14.154
That's gonna be
really tough for me.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.468
I'm pretty busy.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.269
Really? You, too, huh?

22:17.369 --> 22:18.302
Get the Ferrari.

22:18.374 --> 22:20.132
You know, Castle,
Jenny's been bugging me

22:20.133 --> 22:21.711
to set you up with
her cousin Ramona.

22:21.712 --> 22:22.772
She's a dental hygienist.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.108
Mm-hmm. Sounds good.

22:25.564 --> 22:27.816
- Ferrari.
- And I want the Ferrari for the weekend.

22:28.380 --> 22:31.429
All right. Hey, and, buddy,
I am never gonna forget this.

22:32.762 --> 22:33.649
All right. We're all set.

22:34.590 --> 22:35.098
All right.

22:35.530 --> 22:36.803
We'll get the results
in the morning.

22:36.853 --> 22:39.178
Tonight... we celebrate.

22:39.724 --> 22:40.525
Celebrate what?

22:40.768 --> 22:43.259
Well, you survived the first
day on the job with me.

22:44.924 --> 22:46.321
You ever have a
partner who didn't?

22:48.820 --> 22:51.163
You know, I'd love to,
uh, celebrate, but...

22:51.164 --> 22:51.856
But what?

22:52.524 --> 22:54.467
But nothing. But nothing.

22:55.049 --> 22:56.855
Let's... let's do this.

22:56.885 --> 22:58.303
What's the worst that
could happen, right?

23:06.199 --> 23:06.771
What happened?

23:06.772 --> 23:08.581
Dad, I got in. I got in!

23:08.984 --> 23:09.878
Oh, where?

23:09.880 --> 23:11.833
Almost everywhere so far.

23:11.970 --> 23:14.879
Oxford, Princeton,
Sarah Lawrence.

23:15.249 --> 23:17.700
That's great, honey.
I- I knew it would work out.

23:17.940 --> 23:18.523
Really?

23:18.524 --> 23:19.205
Yeah.

23:19.206 --> 23:21.342
Then why were you hiding
the letters from me?

23:22.067 --> 23:23.483
- What?
- Come on, dad.

23:23.484 --> 23:25.638
I can read a postmark.
Some of these came last week.

23:26.541 --> 23:28.493
Oh. I just... I'm sorry.

23:28.626 --> 23:30.219
Honey, I-I'm just
trying to protect you.

23:30.220 --> 23:31.157
I'm 18 now.

23:31.264 --> 23:33.557
You need to trust that I
can take care of my...

23:35.398 --> 23:36.085
myself.

23:36.777 --> 23:37.458
What?

23:37.923 --> 23:38.872
I got into Stanford.

23:38.873 --> 23:40.908
Yes! Oh, great!

23:41.158 --> 23:43.515
That's always been your
first choice, right?

23:45.109 --> 23:46.325
And yet, I sense trouble.

23:47.070 --> 23:47.910
I- I don't know.

23:48.693 --> 23:49.885
I mean, I should be happy,

23:50.348 --> 23:52.589
but after they shot me down
for early admission...

23:53.173 --> 23:55.707
They rejected you, and
you feel betrayed.

23:57.063 --> 23:58.310
How am I supposed
to get over that?

24:03.025 --> 24:03.880
You look like crap.

24:04.398 --> 24:06.490
Here. Little hair of the dog.
That'll get you flying right.

24:06.491 --> 24:08.851
No. It's not gonna do
anything to turn back time.

24:09.634 --> 24:10.796
Anyway, where are we going?

24:11.062 --> 24:12.520
Salvage yard in the Bronx.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.004
I ran that Texas plate
myself last night.

24:15.254 --> 24:17.577
Turns out Maxi was telling the
truth about the third player.

24:18.015 --> 24:20.921
Escalade was registered
to a Cesar Vales.

24:21.100 --> 24:22.602
Runs with a Mexican gang.

24:22.873 --> 24:25.067
Rumor has it they're making
inroads into New York,

24:25.068 --> 24:27.268
trying to corner the market
on the city's crank trade.

24:27.495 --> 24:30.048
So Vales is coming into
town trying to muscle in

24:30.049 --> 24:32.083
on the Westies and
the Jamaicans.

24:32.084 --> 24:33.888
Yeah, which ain't
exactly easy to do.

24:34.102 --> 24:35.642
Well, it would be a lot easier

24:35.643 --> 24:37.533
if he could get them to
take each other out.

24:39.281 --> 24:39.904
That's good.

24:40.737 --> 24:41.438
So he's sitting around

24:41.439 --> 24:43.555
trying to think about a
way to make that happen,

24:43.689 --> 24:45.478
and he overhears Glitch
running his mouth.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.032
Right, he realizes, if a Westie

24:47.033 --> 24:49.460
was to turn up murdered with a
bag full of jamaican heads,

24:49.461 --> 24:50.700
both sides would go to war.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.230
And they could jump in and
take over their territories.

24:55.505 --> 24:56.733
Are you sure it's
such a good idea

24:56.734 --> 24:58.113
to go after this guy ourselves?

24:58.253 --> 25:00.558
I mean, Maxi made 'em
sound pretty dangerous.

25:01.040 --> 25:01.880
Piece of cake.

25:01.881 --> 25:03.761
Guy's nothing but
a two-bit punk.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.881
He's high-level mexican mafia.

25:05.882 --> 25:07.771
About as dangerous as they come.

25:07.793 --> 25:09.983
According to the DEA,
Cesar Vales is suspected

25:09.984 --> 25:11.371
in the deaths of
over a dozen people,

25:11.372 --> 25:13.269
including three cops in Mexico

25:13.270 --> 25:14.579
who were killed
with a sledgehammer

25:14.580 --> 25:16.436
and then cut up into pieces.

25:16.754 --> 25:17.800
You don't think
Castle and Slaughter

25:17.801 --> 25:18.503
are going after him?

25:18.504 --> 25:19.329
I'd put money on it,

25:19.330 --> 25:21.181
'cause I wasn't the only one
who ran his plates last night.

25:21.182 --> 25:22.712
Slaughter did, too.

25:22.729 --> 25:24.304
If Castle and Slaughter
go after this guy,

25:24.305 --> 25:25.225
they're gonna both end up dead.

25:25.226 --> 25:27.231
- We need to warn Castle.
- I tried,

25:27.232 --> 25:28.654
but his phone keeps
going to voice mail.

25:28.655 --> 25:30.132
I got a bad feeling that
they're on their way

25:30.133 --> 25:31.973
to take down Vales right now.

25:40.493 --> 25:42.448
You're not gonna mangle
anyone today, are you?

25:43.403 --> 25:45.232
I like to keep my options open.

25:51.715 --> 25:53.456
There's an awful lot of 'em.

25:53.790 --> 25:55.735
Just follow my lead.

25:57.830 --> 25:58.662
Hola.

25:58.663 --> 26:02.043
Gentlemen, on
behalf of the NYPD,

26:02.044 --> 26:03.918
I'd like to welcome you
to the greatest city

26:03.919 --> 26:05.759
on God's green earth.

26:09.607 --> 26:11.039
Unless you want
your friends to see

26:11.040 --> 26:13.189
what the inside of
your head looks like,

26:13.627 --> 26:14.805
back off.

26:18.181 --> 26:21.953
Wow. Now what seems to
be the problem, officer?

26:21.958 --> 26:22.891
You Vales?

26:22.892 --> 26:23.844
That's me.

26:23.845 --> 26:26.251
Name Michael Reilly
mean anything to you?

26:26.252 --> 26:28.142
AKA Glitch.

26:28.143 --> 26:30.770
No. I'm afraid not.

26:31.124 --> 26:33.210
That's funny, 'cause
I got an eyewitness

26:33.211 --> 26:35.541
that puts you and
your girls here

26:35.658 --> 26:38.304
shooting the hell outta him
in Queens two nights ago.

26:38.408 --> 26:39.639
That is funny.

26:41.137 --> 26:43.324
Hey, you. Where's your badge?

26:44.343 --> 26:45.884
In his other coat.

26:48.376 --> 26:50.947
Yeah, Vales, we know
all about your plan.

26:50.948 --> 26:52.839
Use Glitch to spark a gang war

26:52.840 --> 26:55.970
so you could move your drug
business into New York.

26:55.971 --> 26:58.372
Wow. Your partner here,

26:58.397 --> 26:59.978
he's pretty high-strung,
isn't he?

26:59.979 --> 27:00.939
Yeah.

27:00.940 --> 27:03.371
- High-strung, huh?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:05.973 --> 27:07.477
Hey! NYPD!

27:08.533 --> 27:10.400
NYPD! Let me see your hands!

27:12.758 --> 27:13.901
The party's over.

27:15.222 --> 27:17.796
That's too bad, because this
was just getting interesting.

27:17.797 --> 27:19.458
If I were you, I'd get
your affairs in order,

27:19.459 --> 27:21.347
'cause I'll be back.

27:23.581 --> 27:25.710
Hey! Slaughter.

27:26.635 --> 27:27.370
Going in there like that

27:27.371 --> 27:29.700
without backup, putting a
civilian in harm's way,

27:29.701 --> 27:32.039
that's not only reckless,
that is bad police work.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.591
You're just lucky that
we traced Castle's phone

27:33.592 --> 27:35.235
and we found you guys in time.

27:36.135 --> 27:38.811
What, you think I'm gonna thank
you for almost ruining my play?

27:39.669 --> 27:40.957
You had a play?

27:41.155 --> 27:44.568
I always have a play.
Had to escalate things.

27:44.569 --> 27:46.780
That way I could find the
weak member of the herd.

27:47.737 --> 27:48.652
That kid.

27:48.653 --> 27:49.924
Exactly.

27:49.985 --> 27:51.483
He's the one I'm gonna
get to flip on Vales

27:51.484 --> 27:54.176
once I figure out how to
separate him from the pack.

27:55.075 --> 27:56.239
Who knew all these years

27:56.240 --> 27:58.200
we've been working together
that you had a death wish?

27:58.201 --> 28:00.803
Come on, that? That wasn't bad.

28:00.804 --> 28:02.360
Slaughter had a plan.

28:03.750 --> 28:05.755
Yeah, he had a plan
to get you killed.

28:11.888 --> 28:13.231
It's Slaughter.

28:14.007 --> 28:14.865
I gotta go.

28:14.866 --> 28:15.885
All right.

28:17.700 --> 28:19.939
Next time, we might not
be there to save you.

28:21.936 --> 28:23.589
You need to do something.

28:26.715 --> 28:29.505
Espo, if the guy is hell-bent
on leaving the nest,

28:29.506 --> 28:31.995
then there is nothing
that I can do about it.

28:31.996 --> 28:34.111
You don't really feel
that way, do you?

28:41.552 --> 28:43.032
Don't you listen to those
whiners, Sherlock.

28:43.033 --> 28:44.365
You got balls.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.833
Yeah, I may have
needlessly put you

28:45.868 --> 28:47.408
in a little harm's way
there with Vales,

28:47.409 --> 28:49.638
but seeing as it paid off...

28:50.326 --> 28:51.519
What do you mean, paid off?

28:52.987 --> 28:55.090
What was that? What was what?

28:55.124 --> 28:56.511
Hey, come on, man!
It's not cool!

28:56.512 --> 28:58.653
Is there someone in the trunk?

28:58.654 --> 29:00.959
Gilberto Mendoza, our weak link.

29:00.960 --> 29:02.743
Get me the hell outta here, man!

29:03.632 --> 29:06.752
Please tell me that we are
just going to talk to him.

29:06.753 --> 29:07.952
Yeah, pretty much.

29:12.154 --> 29:14.658
Come on, man! What's going on?!
You can't do that!

29:14.659 --> 29:17.394
This is wrong. You gotta stop.

29:17.395 --> 29:19.271
Not till he flips on Vales.

29:22.383 --> 29:23.200
You hear that, Gilberto?

29:23.201 --> 29:24.803
Only way you're gettin'
out of that trunk

29:24.804 --> 29:26.426
is if you rat out your boss.

29:26.427 --> 29:28.701
Well, guess what.
I'm not sayin' nothing!

29:31.455 --> 29:33.626
Hey, remember that
favor you promised me?

29:33.627 --> 29:36.664
There's this civilian review
board thing coming up.

29:36.665 --> 29:40.075
Excessive force complaints.
Total BS, right?

29:46.043 --> 29:48.200
Anyway, you being a friend
of the mayor and all,

29:48.201 --> 29:49.733
I figure a statement from you

29:49.734 --> 29:52.628
would go a long way to making
those charges go away, right?

29:59.147 --> 30:00.138
You're crazy.

30:00.139 --> 30:01.285
Is that a no?

30:07.324 --> 30:09.121
I'll do it!
I'll do it if you stop!

30:12.146 --> 30:13.888
Outstanding. Next Tuesday.

30:13.889 --> 30:15.296
9:00 AM sharp.

30:15.297 --> 30:16.569
I'll send you an e-mail.

30:18.201 --> 30:19.349
Hey, man, I know my
rights, all right?

30:19.350 --> 30:21.701
- This is kidnapping. Police abuse.
- Uh-huh.

30:21.702 --> 30:23.352
I know something, too, Gilberto.

30:23.353 --> 30:25.393
You got a brother in
juvie back in Texas.

30:25.394 --> 30:26.687
Poor little Hector.

30:26.688 --> 30:29.022
I hear he cries himself
to sleep every night.

30:29.023 --> 30:30.190
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

30:30.191 --> 30:32.902
Just having a little
chat here with Gilberto.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.974
Listen, unless you want
something very bad

30:35.975 --> 30:37.561
to happen to Hector,

30:37.944 --> 30:40.342
you're gonna help me
bury Vales, aren't ya?

30:41.236 --> 30:42.404
Aren't ya?

30:44.530 --> 30:46.313
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

30:46.456 --> 30:48.353
I need to hear the magic words.

30:50.296 --> 30:51.252
Vales killed Glitch.

30:51.253 --> 30:53.201
Vales killed Glitch.

30:53.202 --> 30:56.046
Yes. Victory.

31:02.946 --> 31:05.215
Vales was looking for a way
to take over the Jamaicans'

31:05.217 --> 31:06.691
and the Westies' turf.

31:06.873 --> 31:08.576
That's when we heard about
this punk-ass Westie

31:08.577 --> 31:10.847
trying to prove himself,
and Vales saw his chance.

31:10.848 --> 31:13.807
He convinced Glitch that if he
dug up a couple of Jamaicans

31:13.808 --> 31:14.635
and cut off their heads,

31:14.636 --> 31:16.883
that it would get him back in
tight with his Westie pals.

31:16.884 --> 31:18.358
So Vales wanted to use the heads

31:18.359 --> 31:19.865
to spark a gang war?

31:19.866 --> 31:21.550
For the Westies and
Jamaicans to go at it

31:21.551 --> 31:22.444
till no one's left standing,

31:22.445 --> 31:24.306
then he waltzes in, takes
over the territory?

31:24.307 --> 31:25.389
Yeah.

31:26.017 --> 31:27.211
What went down at the cemetery?

31:27.212 --> 31:29.474
Vales got Glitch to
dig up the bodies.

31:29.475 --> 31:32.063
The plan was to kill
him and make it look

31:32.064 --> 31:33.625
like the Jamaicans did it.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.152
And Glitch must have
sensed it or something,

31:35.153 --> 31:38.368
'cause he took off right as
we started opening fire.

31:41.362 --> 31:42.691
Tell me about the murder.

31:44.780 --> 31:47.028
Look, kid, I know you're scared,

31:47.029 --> 31:48.397
and I was a little rough.

31:48.669 --> 31:51.874
But I talked to the DA
and the Feds.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.201
They said, you
cooperate with me,

31:54.202 --> 31:56.703
your brother's sentence will
be reduced to time served,

31:56.704 --> 31:59.373
and both of you get a
free ride into WITSEC.

31:59.395 --> 32:01.736
So tell me how it went down.

32:04.641 --> 32:07.558
We chased him, we cornered him.

32:07.733 --> 32:09.171
Under the overpass?

32:10.483 --> 32:11.690
Yeah.

32:12.165 --> 32:13.625
And?

32:14.004 --> 32:16.212
And then Vales shot him twice
and just left him for dead.

32:16.213 --> 32:17.637
How many... how many times?

32:24.136 --> 32:25.356
Three.

32:25.806 --> 32:27.410
He shot him three times.

32:31.141 --> 32:32.449
What do you think you're doing?

32:32.450 --> 32:33.856
Closing this case.

32:33.857 --> 32:35.381
I got an arrest
warrant for Vales

32:35.382 --> 32:36.474
burning a hole in my pocket.

32:36.475 --> 32:37.996
You coached that kid
through his interrogation.

32:37.997 --> 32:39.011
What? Nah, nah.

32:39.012 --> 32:41.011
I just refreshed
his recollection.

32:41.012 --> 32:42.439
Really?
'Cause the way he was talking,

32:42.440 --> 32:43.836
he didn't even
witness that murder.

32:43.837 --> 32:45.009
Hey. H...

32:46.348 --> 32:48.779
Vales has bodies on him
like you wouldn't believe...

32:48.780 --> 32:51.631
women, children, cops.

32:51.632 --> 32:53.464
And I got a chance to put him away.
I'm gonna take it.

32:53.465 --> 32:56.013
The question is,
are you in or out?

32:57.445 --> 32:58.840
I guess I'm out.

33:00.670 --> 33:01.965
Well, that's a shame.

33:02.705 --> 33:04.978
I had high hopes
for you, Sherlock.

33:05.773 --> 33:08.318
Never thought you'd punk
out on me like this.

33:14.642 --> 33:15.548
Hey.

33:15.549 --> 33:16.455
I need some help.

33:16.456 --> 33:18.384
Sorry, Castle. Caught a murder.

33:18.524 --> 33:19.799
Talk to Beckett.

33:27.331 --> 33:28.523
Hey.

33:29.467 --> 33:30.204
How's it going?

33:30.205 --> 33:32.846
You can skip the small talk, Castle.
What do you want?

33:33.977 --> 33:35.456
Slaughter went too far.

33:35.819 --> 33:37.159
Well, isn't that what he does,

33:37.160 --> 33:39.603
along with kicking ass
and taking names?

33:39.604 --> 33:41.912
He pressured a kid into
making a false statement

33:41.913 --> 33:43.302
so he could arrest Vales.

33:43.303 --> 33:44.466
So you came to me
so I can fix it?

33:44.467 --> 33:45.589
You have every right to be mad.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.489
You warned me about Slaughter,
and I wouldn't listen.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.565
I'm just trying to
make this right.

33:49.566 --> 33:51.444
It's not my case, Castle.

33:51.445 --> 33:53.012
Even if I wanted to help,

33:53.013 --> 33:54.344
we've got strict rules about

33:54.345 --> 33:57.267
interfering in another
cop's investigation.

33:57.268 --> 33:59.217
I'm not asking you
to do it for me.

33:59.218 --> 34:00.175
I'm asking you to do it

34:00.176 --> 34:02.556
so the real killer doesn't
get away with murder.

34:03.029 --> 34:04.782
What makes you think I'm
actually gonna fall

34:04.783 --> 34:07.479
for that blatant manipulation?

34:07.480 --> 34:08.705
Because it's true.

34:15.324 --> 34:16.246
What's this?

34:16.246 --> 34:18.391
A traffic cam shot of Vales' car

34:18.393 --> 34:21.748
10 blocks from the cemetery,
heading away from the overpass

34:21.750 --> 34:23.288
where Glitch was killed.

34:23.746 --> 34:25.168
11:57.

34:25.168 --> 34:27.107
Glitch was killed
after midnight.

34:27.616 --> 34:29.789
This shows that Vales
couldn't have killed him.

34:31.413 --> 34:32.755
You did this for me?

34:36.309 --> 34:37.841
All this time, you had my back.

34:37.842 --> 34:39.632
I had Ryan run a
traffic cam search

34:39.632 --> 34:42.306
while he was pulling a plate.

34:42.434 --> 34:43.973
It's not a smoking gun, Castle.

34:43.974 --> 34:46.757
Okay? You can't even see
Vales' face in that photo.

34:46.757 --> 34:48.681
It's not enough to
change Slaughter's mind

34:48.683 --> 34:50.561
unless you've got
something else.

34:52.268 --> 34:54.688
There is one more thing
that doesn't make sense.

34:54.688 --> 34:56.804
This is a map of the area.

34:56.806 --> 34:58.883
Here's the cemetery.
Here's the overpass.

34:58.884 --> 35:01.465
But to get to it, Glitch would
have to climb a 6-foot fence.

35:01.466 --> 35:04.747
Why do that when there's a
subway station a block away?

35:04.969 --> 35:06.776
Why hide when you can run?

35:06.777 --> 35:08.409
Maybe we can find out.

35:10.806 --> 35:12.375
According to the CSU report,

35:12.376 --> 35:14.941
- Glitch was shot somewhere around here.
- Uh-huh.

35:14.942 --> 35:15.843
He staggered away

35:15.844 --> 35:17.654
and ended up on the other
side of that pillar.

35:17.655 --> 35:20.214
So you think that Vales'
plan was to use Glitch

35:20.216 --> 35:22.395
and the jamaican heads
to start up a gang war?

35:22.396 --> 35:23.252
Yeah. Why?

35:23.253 --> 35:25.293
I don't know, Castle.
That's not what I'm seeing.

35:25.294 --> 35:27.631
Let's say I'm Vales

35:27.858 --> 35:31.282
and I shoot Glitch
to start that war.

35:31.528 --> 35:32.201
Where do you think would be

35:32.202 --> 35:34.394
the best spot to
drop off that body?

35:34.879 --> 35:36.092
In the middle of
Westie territory.

35:36.093 --> 35:39.117
Exactly.
So why did he leave it here?

35:41.163 --> 35:42.752
Oh, crap.

35:42.884 --> 35:44.095
Well...

35:44.887 --> 35:47.274
imagine my surprise when
I got to the station

35:47.275 --> 35:48.812
with my killer,

35:48.813 --> 35:51.320
and I hear you're stirring
up my crime scene.

35:51.321 --> 35:52.542
Okay, look, I can explain.

35:52.543 --> 35:54.936
Save it. He doesn't know
any better, but you do.

35:54.937 --> 35:57.790
What I know is that you
coerced a confession

35:57.791 --> 35:59.363
out of an 18-year-old kid.

35:59.364 --> 36:01.135
I didn't coerce jack.

36:01.136 --> 36:03.181
He works for a guy who's
got a trail of bodies

36:03.182 --> 36:05.033
that stretches all the way
back to the Rio Grande.

36:05.034 --> 36:06.456
If he doesn't go down for this,

36:06.457 --> 36:07.659
the body count just grows.

36:07.660 --> 36:10.365
We got a traffic video camera
photo of Vales' escalade

36:10.366 --> 36:11.965
10 blocks from here when
the murder went down.

36:11.966 --> 36:14.781
Yeah, so what?
Could you see him in the car?

36:15.540 --> 36:16.306
Not exactly.

36:16.307 --> 36:17.693
And if his lawyer
gets ahold of it,

36:17.694 --> 36:19.505
you've handed him
reasonable doubt,

36:19.506 --> 36:21.191
and Vales walks.

36:21.192 --> 36:22.291
Maybe he deserves to walk.

36:22.292 --> 36:24.541
He deserves to be
pulled apart by horses.

36:24.542 --> 36:26.317
But the law says
I can't do that.

36:26.318 --> 36:27.348
But what I can do is,

36:27.349 --> 36:29.622
I can lock him up in prison
for the rest of his life.

36:29.623 --> 36:32.215
Now the question is,
are you gonna back off

36:32.216 --> 36:35.134
or am I gonna have to report
you for jumping my case?

36:35.135 --> 36:37.669
You do what you gotta
do, Slaughter.

36:37.670 --> 36:39.186
And I'll do the same.

36:47.194 --> 36:48.105
Thanks.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.311
We got about an hour to figure
out who really killed Glitch

36:50.312 --> 36:51.429
before I get called
to the carpet

36:51.430 --> 36:53.166
by the chief of detectives.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.340
What can he do to you?

36:54.341 --> 36:56.010
Well, best-case scenario,

36:56.011 --> 36:57.342
he suspends me.

36:57.842 --> 36:59.388
And worst-case scenario?

37:02.841 --> 37:04.077
Crap.

37:07.990 --> 37:08.917
So I'm Glitch.

37:08.918 --> 37:11.524
I just dug up three bodies,
cut the heads off 'em,

37:11.525 --> 37:12.672
which was horrible,

37:12.673 --> 37:15.293
to try and win my way
back in with the Westies.

37:15.294 --> 37:16.834
And then the kindly
mexican gentlemen

37:16.835 --> 37:17.682
I thought were helping me

37:17.683 --> 37:19.387
suddenly pull out guns
and try to kill me.

37:19.388 --> 37:20.899
Running for my life,

37:20.900 --> 37:23.892
I end up on the wrong
side of this fence.

37:23.893 --> 37:26.515
Where you can see a
sign for the subway.

37:26.516 --> 37:29.862
So why would you climb
a barbed wire fence

37:29.863 --> 37:33.409
when can just hang a right
and hop a train outta here?

37:33.550 --> 37:34.614
Fear.

37:34.813 --> 37:35.865
For all I know, the Mexicans

37:35.866 --> 37:37.660
are driving the streets
looking for me.

37:37.661 --> 37:39.760
With all these street lights
on, I'd be a sitting duck.

37:39.761 --> 37:42.851
But under here, it
would be pitch black,

37:42.852 --> 37:45.794
so I climb the fence and I hide.

37:45.795 --> 37:47.886
Why hide when you can escape?

37:49.919 --> 37:51.122
Because I wasn't just hiding.

37:51.123 --> 37:53.436
I was waiting.
I called for help.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.653
But when they found
Glitch's body,

37:54.654 --> 37:55.992
he didn't have a
phone on him, so...

37:55.993 --> 37:58.364
So either the killer took it or...

37:58.365 --> 37:59.932
Or he used that pay phone.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.755
Why'd you call me down here?

38:07.495 --> 38:11.239
Because we have definitive proof
that Vales didn't kill Glitch.

38:11.372 --> 38:12.971
And you want to rub
my face in it?

38:12.972 --> 38:13.979
No.

38:13.980 --> 38:16.238
Look, Slaughter, we're
different kids of cops.

38:16.239 --> 38:16.815
Yeah.

38:16.816 --> 38:19.282
And although I'm not a
fan of your methods,

38:19.283 --> 38:21.152
I know you don't want to
send an innocent man to jail

38:21.153 --> 38:23.910
when you know that the real
killer is still out there.

38:30.551 --> 38:32.571
Okay. So who killed Glitch?

38:33.271 --> 38:34.848
We know he called you, Brian.

38:34.849 --> 38:37.932
Your son dialed your
cell from that pay phone

38:37.933 --> 38:39.844
about a half an hour
before he was murdered,

38:39.845 --> 38:41.779
and you answered that call.

38:42.328 --> 38:43.675
We also have surveillance photos

38:43.676 --> 38:45.994
of you at that subway
stop from before

38:45.995 --> 38:47.553
and after the murder.

38:47.655 --> 38:49.121
All those years...

38:49.811 --> 38:51.506
all those screwups...

38:52.283 --> 38:54.516
must have been unbearable for
a stand-up guy like you,

38:54.517 --> 38:55.731
huh, Brian?

38:55.962 --> 38:58.681
And then Glitch calls you to
tell you that he screwed up

38:58.682 --> 38:59.934
again.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.899
But this time, it was
different, wasn't it?

39:06.127 --> 39:07.366
He'd crossed the line.

39:07.367 --> 39:08.327
He was your son.

39:08.328 --> 39:10.987
Which made him my
responsibility.

39:12.203 --> 39:14.080
So I did what had to be done.

39:17.732 --> 39:19.738
He wasn't even surprised.

39:22.093 --> 39:26.197
'Twas if he'd been waiting
for it his whole life.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.046
Then why didn't you
take the heads?

39:32.047 --> 39:32.870
That way, none of this

39:32.871 --> 39:34.677
would come back on
you and the Westies.

39:36.116 --> 39:38.886
He vanished into the
dark after I'd shot him.

39:40.941 --> 39:42.379
Even with his last breath,

39:42.380 --> 39:44.457
that boy managed to screw me up.

39:46.494 --> 39:49.284
Well, at least you'll finally
get a conviction on Brian.

39:49.484 --> 39:51.342
That's gotta be
some consolation.

39:51.984 --> 39:53.640
But Vales still walks.

39:57.334 --> 39:58.493
Excuse me.

40:00.008 --> 40:01.240
Counselor.

40:01.588 --> 40:03.650
Can I speak with your
client for a second?

40:03.651 --> 40:05.621
She probably wants my autograph.

40:06.223 --> 40:07.983
You feel cocky. I get it.

40:07.984 --> 40:09.805
You just dodged a murder rap.

40:09.806 --> 40:12.577
Probably gonna go out tonight
and celebrate with your boys,

40:12.578 --> 40:14.876
and you should paint the town.

40:14.877 --> 40:17.156
But then in the morning,

40:17.157 --> 40:21.963
I want you to get the
hell out of my city.

40:22.667 --> 40:24.005
But I like it here.

40:24.006 --> 40:25.868
You might like it right now.

40:25.869 --> 40:27.649
But starting tomorrow,
you're gonna see

40:27.650 --> 40:29.681
just how hard a city
New York can be

40:29.682 --> 40:31.655
when the full force of the NYPD

40:31.656 --> 40:33.509
comes crashing down on you

40:33.510 --> 40:35.039
with 30,000 cops

40:35.040 --> 40:37.959
making it their daily
duty to make your life

40:37.960 --> 40:39.862
a living hell.

40:42.796 --> 40:45.360
Counselor, you can
take him away now.

40:45.361 --> 40:46.932
Oh, that is sexy.

40:48.705 --> 40:51.057
What, you want to hit
me for that, too?

40:51.058 --> 40:52.194
No.

40:56.008 --> 40:57.789
That's for not having my back.

40:57.790 --> 40:59.199
Oh, and if I ever see

40:59.200 --> 41:00.846
a character in one of
your novels like me,

41:00.847 --> 41:01.877
we're gonna have words.

41:01.878 --> 41:03.822
So I'm gonna see you at the
hearing on Tuesday, right?

41:03.823 --> 41:04.949
You got it.

41:04.950 --> 41:06.383
Outstanding.

41:07.163 --> 41:09.038
Detective, you ever
want to go on a date

41:09.039 --> 41:11.422
that ends in hot sex after
a drunken fistfight,

41:11.423 --> 41:12.548
you know where to find me.

41:12.549 --> 41:15.638
Uh, yeah, in
never-gonna-happen land.

41:16.303 --> 41:17.484
Hey.

41:17.883 --> 41:20.455
Thanks very much for your help.

41:20.456 --> 41:21.242
No problem, Castle.

41:21.243 --> 41:23.230
It's what partners
are supposed to do.

41:34.062 --> 41:36.304
Basking in the glory of you?

41:36.712 --> 41:39.560
No, trying to figure
out what to do.

41:40.059 --> 41:42.030
Stanford has always
been my dream school.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.766
But what if their
initial rejection

41:43.767 --> 41:45.447
was the universe
sending me a sign

41:45.448 --> 41:47.037
that I'm better off
somewhere else?

41:47.038 --> 41:49.241
You think you'd be better
off somewhere else?

41:49.760 --> 41:50.998
I don't know.

41:51.374 --> 41:52.488
Do you?

41:53.625 --> 41:54.999
I don't know, either.

41:56.167 --> 41:57.776
I guess the question is,

41:57.777 --> 41:59.625
do you want it badly enough...

42:01.131 --> 42:02.944
to get over being hurt?

42:07.615 --> 42:09.533
You know what I think would
help with this decision?

42:11.372 --> 42:12.751
Ice cream.

42:14.373 --> 42:15.511
Race you.

42:18.006 --> 42:19.108
That's cheating!

42:20.305 --> 42:26.222
