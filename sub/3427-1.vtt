01:24.333 --> 01:27.101
Eight, nine, ten.

01:27.103 --> 01:29.170
Ready or not, here I come.

01:31.840 --> 01:33.007
Larry!

01:34.776 --> 01:35.843
Rachel!

01:54.596 --> 01:55.896
Who are you?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.898
What are you doing here?

01:57.900 --> 01:59.800
We're playing a game.

01:59.802 --> 02:02.169
I'm playing with
Larry and Rachel.

02:02.171 --> 02:03.505
Who are you?

02:04.407 --> 02:05.973
I'm Michelle.

02:08.009 --> 02:10.745
You brought me here.
You drove me.

02:37.106 --> 02:38.406
<i>Yeah, Darkroom?</i>

02:38.408 --> 02:40.775
I got your card from
Rachel Lefferson.

02:40.777 --> 02:42.910
She's a therapist at...

02:42.912 --> 02:45.980
<i>Oh, yeah, Rachel.
Rehab center.</i>

02:45.982 --> 02:47.081
Right.

02:49.818 --> 02:52.687
Parents gone.
Any other living relatives?

02:54.022 --> 02:55.690
No.

02:57.759 --> 02:59.160
What about school?

02:59.162 --> 03:01.429
They took away my aid

03:01.431 --> 03:04.031
after the accident
and the court order.

03:06.703 --> 03:08.736
I'm gonna come to the point,
Michelle.

03:08.738 --> 03:11.105
You're eligible to leave
with my signed approval.

03:12.174 --> 03:15.276
But you'll stay indefinitely
until I give you a good review.

03:16.812 --> 03:18.892
If you want to get out of here,
you have to prove it.

03:31.927 --> 03:33.761
Someone call for a ride?

03:33.763 --> 03:34.929
Yeah.

03:40.035 --> 03:42.002
Thank you.
No problem.

03:45.474 --> 03:46.807
So, where to?

03:46.809 --> 03:49.977
The address is 1040
Millview Lane.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.112
Yeah.

03:53.014 --> 03:54.482
What's wrong?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.083
Nothing.

03:56.085 --> 03:59.286
Just... nothing.

04:06.895 --> 04:09.897
Do you mind if I
ask what happened?

04:09.899 --> 04:11.232
To your leg?

04:13.769 --> 04:16.103
It doesn't matter.

04:16.105 --> 04:19.140
I'm sorry, my mouth goes
too fast sometimes.

04:22.244 --> 04:23.778
And then what happened?

04:25.013 --> 04:26.914
I woke up in the hospital,

04:26.916 --> 04:29.817
and I had never felt
that pathetic.

04:29.819 --> 04:31.952
Oh, God, my brother.

04:35.123 --> 04:37.024
How could I have...

04:40.929 --> 04:42.997
He's gone.

04:44.934 --> 04:48.002
Thank you, Jean.
Takes a lot of courage.

04:48.004 --> 04:50.271
The process has begun.

04:50.273 --> 04:53.174
You've started on the
course of penitence.

04:53.176 --> 04:56.544
And you'll find peace.
I know you will.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.879
Michelle, have you decided

04:58.881 --> 05:01.115
to share your experience
with the group?

05:03.952 --> 05:05.319
How about it?

05:11.259 --> 05:12.359
No?

05:34.850 --> 05:36.984
Well, we're here, I guess.

05:49.631 --> 05:50.931
Michelle!

05:51.933 --> 05:53.334
You can pull around back.

05:53.336 --> 05:54.335
Nancy will take care of you.

05:54.337 --> 05:58.873
Yeah, she'll be doing
your hair and wardrobe.

05:58.875 --> 06:04.211
I thought I was just doing
some PA/gopher stuff.

06:04.213 --> 06:07.214
Not today,
I had a model drop out.

06:07.216 --> 06:09.350
That's okay, right?
It's the same pay.

06:09.352 --> 06:11.986
Oh, you want me to model?

06:11.988 --> 06:14.421
Hmm.
What exactly is this for?

06:14.423 --> 06:16.957
It's for print fashion shots

06:16.959 --> 06:19.360
for a real estate periodical.

06:19.362 --> 06:20.461
Real exciting stuff, huh?

06:22.631 --> 06:24.365
Well, I've never
done this before.

06:24.367 --> 06:27.334
Ah. Don't worry.
I'll take good care of you.

06:27.336 --> 06:28.502
I'll see you in a bit?

06:57.265 --> 06:58.365
Hey, there.

07:00.101 --> 07:04.004
I'm Daniel.
I've seen you around.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.173
Michelle.

07:06.175 --> 07:08.475
I work here, odds and ends.

07:08.477 --> 07:10.344
Yeah, I've seen you.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.416
You ready for the bad news?

07:15.418 --> 07:17.484
We're not allowed to smoke here.

07:21.089 --> 07:22.356
I've heard.

07:27.195 --> 07:29.196
Shit.

07:29.198 --> 07:32.066
Thought I was enlightening you.
Hmm.

07:35.270 --> 07:37.371
Well, I'll see you around.

07:38.306 --> 07:39.440
Yeah.

07:52.153 --> 07:53.220
Thanks for the ride.

07:53.222 --> 07:55.122
Sure thing.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.159
Give a call if you
need a ride back.

07:59.161 --> 08:01.028
Okay. Thanks.

08:31.793 --> 08:34.094
Hi, you must be Michelle!

08:34.096 --> 08:35.562
Uh, yeah. It's me.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.432
You find it okay?

08:40.268 --> 08:42.568
Okay, come on, come on,
let's get started.

08:50.512 --> 08:52.446
This place is amazing!

08:55.116 --> 08:57.117
Does someone actually live here?

08:57.119 --> 08:59.186
It's for sale.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.587
Come along.
No time for today.

09:02.190 --> 09:04.158
Place is huge.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.293
Larry wants to start in the study,
then move to the backyard.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.096
I think the weather is
gonna hold up just fine.

09:09.098 --> 09:11.198
You need to use
the little girl's room?

09:11.200 --> 09:13.333
Uh, no, I'm fine.

09:46.568 --> 09:47.868
All right, let's get started.

09:47.870 --> 09:50.204
Larry likes to keep his schedule.

09:53.341 --> 09:55.109
Could you take off your jewelry?

09:59.447 --> 10:01.448
My, you are very lovely.

10:02.484 --> 10:04.118
Thank you.

10:17.232 --> 10:18.332
Am I hurting you?

10:19.467 --> 10:21.335
No.

10:27.609 --> 10:30.277
Ooh, so sorry.

10:30.279 --> 10:31.578
Did I hurt you?

10:38.153 --> 10:39.553
Pretty, pretty.

10:43.658 --> 10:46.326
Okay, outfit, outfit.

10:46.328 --> 10:47.461
Larry said that this was

10:47.463 --> 10:50.330
some sort of real estate shoot?

10:50.332 --> 10:52.732
It's like a PR shoot.
You just have to smile and be yourself.

10:54.235 --> 10:57.771
Here we go.
Yeah, this looks like your size.

10:59.274 --> 11:00.440
You'll look great.

11:00.442 --> 11:02.643
Oh, and, uh...

11:02.645 --> 11:05.579
Put these on and I'll
give you some privacy.

11:54.429 --> 11:58.632
The reason I'm not in school
anymore is because, um...

11:59.968 --> 12:01.768
I was in an accident.

12:03.738 --> 12:05.272
You can do it, Michelle.

12:05.274 --> 12:07.541
You can be purged
and free of your past.

12:09.644 --> 12:11.578
Come on.

12:13.715 --> 12:16.350
I was driving.

12:16.352 --> 12:19.319
And Trey was...

12:19.321 --> 12:21.555
He was my boyfriend.

12:23.725 --> 12:24.992
We were arguing.

12:27.996 --> 12:29.596
He was distracting me.

12:33.001 --> 12:34.668
It wasn't my fault.

12:38.406 --> 12:39.673
Is that it?

12:41.743 --> 12:42.876
Yep.

12:52.420 --> 12:53.820
Knock, knock.

12:55.757 --> 12:58.759
Excellent,
Larry is gonna be so pleased.

12:58.761 --> 13:00.761
So, the study is down the hall.

13:00.763 --> 13:03.597
This way, you make a right.
It's the last room.

13:24.652 --> 13:26.853
My parents died when I was 14.

13:28.089 --> 13:32.059
And I just moved around from
foster home to foster home...

13:32.061 --> 13:35.796
Until I realized I was
better off on my own.

13:37.332 --> 13:39.533
My dad died when I
was young, too.

13:39.535 --> 13:41.735
Makes it hard to trust people.

13:43.371 --> 13:45.806
You know, I felt
better when I talked.

13:48.509 --> 13:50.077
Look, I'm sorry, okay?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.812
I didn't mean to upset you.

13:51.814 --> 13:54.748
I just...
I can't talk about this anymore.

14:52.540 --> 14:54.875
You're so lucky to be
leaving this dump.

14:54.877 --> 14:59.546
Remember, you gotta talk about
what got you into here, Michelle.

14:59.548 --> 15:00.914
It's the only way out.

15:00.916 --> 15:02.949
You got no other choice.

15:04.619 --> 15:05.819
See ya.

15:12.660 --> 15:13.860
Hello?

15:15.630 --> 15:16.830
Nancy?

15:38.586 --> 15:40.921
Can I, uh...
Can I talk to you?

15:40.923 --> 15:44.558
Jean got here after I did.

15:45.694 --> 15:46.960
Why am I still here?

15:46.962 --> 15:49.629
Jean was an active participant
in this community.

15:49.631 --> 15:52.532
When you participate,
then you can go, too.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.768
But I just want to
move on with my life.

15:54.770 --> 15:57.204
Well, I find that very offensive.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.874
I'd say you have plenty of
issues to work out here.

16:13.020 --> 16:16.089
Hello!
Nancy!

16:17.625 --> 16:18.792
Larry?

16:42.050 --> 16:43.617
Hello?

16:55.897 --> 16:57.063
Hello?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.635
Is anyone there?

17:32.867 --> 17:33.934
Larry?

17:35.803 --> 17:36.970
Nancy?

18:05.099 --> 18:07.334
Hello.

18:11.606 --> 18:13.940
Shit!

18:13.942 --> 18:15.642
Oh, my God!

18:22.384 --> 18:23.683
Hello?

18:28.689 --> 18:30.156
Is anyone there?

18:40.868 --> 18:42.702
Please answer me.

18:48.776 --> 18:50.043
Come get me, Rachel.

19:04.793 --> 19:06.393
<i>Oh, careful!</i>

19:06.395 --> 19:08.662
<i>Boys, play nice.
Play nice.</i>

19:10.399 --> 19:12.999
<i>Boys, be sweet, be sweet.
Come on, Daniel.</i>

19:17.138 --> 19:19.072
<i>Is your name...
No.</i>

19:21.876 --> 19:24.077
<i>I can't pick it up...</i>

19:28.416 --> 19:29.849
<i>It's not working.
Here, you try.</i>

19:31.153 --> 19:32.952
<i>Amy!</i>

19:40.027 --> 19:41.695
Oh, my God.

19:49.070 --> 19:50.136
Hey!

19:50.138 --> 19:52.005
What the fuck is this?

19:54.842 --> 19:58.111
Let me out!
Come on!

20:01.248 --> 20:04.784
What do you want from me?
Come on!

20:04.786 --> 20:06.786
No!

20:34.482 --> 20:37.784
This is your key and the address
where you're gonna be living.

20:37.786 --> 20:40.153
Work is really a big part of
the rehabilitation process.

20:40.155 --> 20:42.222
Do you have any thoughts?

20:43.924 --> 20:46.025
I'll see what comes.

20:46.027 --> 20:47.927
I do want you to
stay off the street.

20:47.929 --> 20:50.049
I wouldn't want you to end
up some kind of dirty girl.

20:52.166 --> 20:53.833
What's this?

20:53.835 --> 20:57.971
Larry's a friend. He sometimes
has opportunities for our girls.

20:57.973 --> 21:00.140
I'll let you finish up here.

21:48.155 --> 21:49.355
Hello?

21:54.895 --> 21:56.095
Hello, you fucks!

22:13.280 --> 22:15.315
Hey!

22:15.317 --> 22:17.383
Oh, fuck!
Fuck you!

22:19.220 --> 22:21.054
Hello?

22:21.056 --> 22:23.156
You fuckers!

22:25.160 --> 22:26.359
Cheers.

22:28.395 --> 22:29.462
And another.

22:30.866 --> 22:33.967
Well, if you act like a dick,
I'm gonna keep going at it.

22:33.969 --> 22:35.201
Look, stop lecturing me.

22:35.203 --> 22:36.236
Oh, you're such an asshole.

22:36.238 --> 22:37.637
Get over here!
Get over here!

22:37.639 --> 22:39.272
Hey! Hey!
What?

22:39.274 --> 22:40.340
Watch your hands.

22:40.342 --> 22:42.141
You're twisting her arm.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.343
And how is that any
of your business?

22:43.345 --> 22:44.410
I'm making it my business,
all right?

22:44.412 --> 22:46.112
Stay out of it!
Oh, my God!

22:46.114 --> 22:49.349
Yo, why don't you take
control of your girlfriend.

22:49.351 --> 22:51.184
Uh, you know what? Fuck you.
No, fuck you!

22:52.887 --> 22:54.387
No! It's not my fault.
Help!

22:56.123 --> 22:57.190
Get out of here!

23:02.363 --> 23:03.897
Hello?

23:06.233 --> 23:08.034
Is anyone there?

23:29.957 --> 23:31.658
Hi.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.693
So, you're leaving us.

23:33.695 --> 23:35.128
Finally.

23:36.196 --> 23:38.665
You must feel good.

23:38.667 --> 23:40.667
Uh...

23:40.669 --> 23:42.669
Yeah, I mean,
as good as it can feel.

23:42.671 --> 23:45.405
I still got some shit
to work out, though.

23:45.407 --> 23:48.241
You'll do fine.
Hey.

23:49.710 --> 23:51.177
I brought you something.

23:52.146 --> 23:53.246
What?

23:58.319 --> 24:00.279
Thought you could think of
me when you smoke them.

24:01.689 --> 24:04.123
You know, uh, maybe we could...

24:05.793 --> 24:08.696
I have some additional
forms for you.

24:08.697 --> 24:12.699
Daniel, I thought that you needed
to pack up the art supplies?

24:12.701 --> 24:13.967
Yeah, I'm on it.

24:16.136 --> 24:18.004
Good luck out there.

24:37.725 --> 24:39.058
No!

25:03.751 --> 25:05.018
Oh, my God!

25:06.353 --> 25:08.354
<i>Please help me!</i>

25:14.062 --> 25:17.230
- Let me out of here!
<i>- Quiet!</i>

25:19.299 --> 25:22.168
What is this about, okay?
Let me out!

25:22.170 --> 25:23.403
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

25:27.141 --> 25:28.441
<i>Have a seat.</i>

25:31.145 --> 25:33.146
<i>Have a seat in a chair!</i>

25:42.389 --> 25:44.057
<i>Let's begin.</i>

25:46.193 --> 25:47.326
<i>Confess.</i>

25:48.462 --> 25:49.562
<i>Confess, my child.</i>

25:53.233 --> 25:55.601
<i>I confess.</i>

25:55.603 --> 25:58.071
<i>What do you confess?</i>

25:59.406 --> 26:01.074
<i>I was wrong.</i>

26:02.342 --> 26:03.443
<i>Oh.</i>

26:04.578 --> 26:06.245
<i>Praise God.</i>

26:07.347 --> 26:09.348
<i>The purging has begun.</i>

26:10.617 --> 26:13.252
Been a naughty girl,
haven't you?

26:14.555 --> 26:16.622
<i>Haven't you?</i>

26:16.624 --> 26:18.191
<i>Say it.</i>

26:20.527 --> 26:22.361
<i>I've been a naughty girl.</i>

26:24.531 --> 26:27.133
<i>You're a slut!</i>

26:27.135 --> 26:28.601
A Goddamn whore.

26:34.541 --> 26:36.442
<i>What are you doing?</i>

26:36.444 --> 26:40.413
<i>What are you doing?
What are you doing?</i>

26:40.415 --> 26:42.281
<i>Please! No!</i>

26:44.118 --> 26:45.318
<i>Confess.</i>

26:46.587 --> 26:49.122
<i>You have to confess.</i>

26:51.592 --> 26:52.658
<i>Huh?</i>

26:52.660 --> 26:55.461
<i>No! Let me out!</i>

26:55.463 --> 26:58.431
<i>Let me out!
Hey!</i>

27:06.607 --> 27:07.707
<i>Shut your mouth.</i>

27:12.479 --> 27:14.147
Oh, my God!

27:23.224 --> 27:26.359
How is this my fault?
I was trying to protect you.

27:26.361 --> 27:28.594
Look,
I don't need your protection.

27:28.596 --> 27:30.229
Guys, it's done, relax!

27:30.231 --> 27:34.634
No, no, no, the night's over, I just...
Done.

27:34.636 --> 27:36.502
Okay.

27:36.504 --> 27:38.024
What would you have
done to that guy?

27:38.050 --> 27:38.404
Oh, shit!

27:38.406 --> 27:40.506
Michelle,
should you be driving?

27:40.508 --> 27:42.441
I am fine, okay?

27:42.443 --> 27:44.377
It's my ride, my rules.

29:04.491 --> 29:06.325
Let go of me.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.393
No!

29:16.536 --> 29:18.404
Stay the fuck away from me!

29:19.740 --> 29:21.674
What do you want with me?

29:25.012 --> 29:27.313
Stay the fuck away from me!

29:28.315 --> 29:30.316
No!

29:40.360 --> 29:43.629
I told you she was a dirty girl.

29:43.631 --> 29:45.031
You bitch!

29:45.033 --> 29:47.633
The Lord hates a crude tongue.

29:54.541 --> 29:55.808
Patience, sister.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.446
No!

30:02.517 --> 30:04.650
Welcome to my little fun house.

30:04.652 --> 30:06.319
Isn't that right, Daniel?

30:07.789 --> 30:09.355
We had so much fun here as kids.

30:10.458 --> 30:12.525
Why are you doing this to me?

30:12.527 --> 30:13.793
I didn't do anything to you.

30:13.795 --> 30:16.595
We got plenty of time
to answer that question.

30:30.344 --> 30:31.644
Fuck you!

30:36.817 --> 30:39.485
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with me?

30:40.687 --> 30:42.388
What is wrong with you?

30:42.390 --> 30:43.823
You put me in a very bad position.

30:43.825 --> 30:47.393
I can't keep protecting you.
Stop it.

30:48.729 --> 30:49.829
Daniel knows his role.

30:49.831 --> 30:51.831
He better know his role.

30:51.833 --> 30:53.833
This is your responsibility
to teach him.

30:53.835 --> 30:56.102
We can't take care of him forever.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.703
I have work to do.

30:57.705 --> 30:59.605
Go be eyes and ears.

31:06.447 --> 31:09.582
Don't ever talk that way
in front of him again.

31:10.851 --> 31:12.651
Know your place.

31:25.665 --> 31:26.999
Hello?

31:28.869 --> 31:30.436
Hello?

31:30.438 --> 31:31.637
Hello?

31:34.408 --> 31:36.175
Is someone there?

31:36.177 --> 31:38.144
Yes.

31:38.146 --> 31:40.146
Who is this?

31:41.816 --> 31:43.716
My name is Jean Balfour.

31:44.885 --> 31:46.886
Jean?

31:46.888 --> 31:49.488
Oh, my God, it's Michelle.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.890
Michelle.

31:50.892 --> 31:52.725
Oh, my God.

31:52.727 --> 31:53.759
We gotta get out of here.

31:53.761 --> 31:55.428
These people are nuts.

31:58.433 --> 31:59.865
Um...

31:59.867 --> 32:03.769
Is there anything in your room?
Anything at all?

32:03.771 --> 32:05.671
Just a chair.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.873
I'm wearing some
stupid green dress.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.910
My God,
I think they're gonna kill us.

32:10.912 --> 32:13.779
They're not gonna kill us.

32:13.781 --> 32:15.781
We're gonna get out of this room.

32:15.783 --> 32:17.716
How?

32:17.718 --> 32:20.653
I don't know.
I just...

32:20.655 --> 32:22.455
I need to think.

32:26.594 --> 32:28.494
Oh, God!

32:33.800 --> 32:35.201
Oh, God.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.469
Michelle!

32:37.537 --> 32:38.871
Michelle, help!

32:38.873 --> 32:40.473
Wait, what are you...
Wait!

32:41.608 --> 32:43.542
What are you doing?

32:46.713 --> 32:48.047
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Please!

32:49.583 --> 32:50.649
Please!

32:58.525 --> 32:59.925
Leave her alone!

33:22.582 --> 33:24.116
No! Stop it!

33:32.859 --> 33:34.793
<i>Let her go!</i>

33:38.031 --> 33:39.098
Jean!

33:54.781 --> 33:56.282
Hey!

33:56.284 --> 33:57.650
Jean!

33:57.652 --> 33:59.118
Hello?

34:20.607 --> 34:22.007
God!

34:32.918 --> 34:34.587
Sweetheart.

34:35.989 --> 34:37.922
I have something for you.

34:44.630 --> 34:45.697
Not so fast.

34:49.803 --> 34:51.870
You have to sing for your supper.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.841
Give me the food, bitch.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.810
Tsk, tsk.

34:57.812 --> 34:59.845
The Lord hates a crude tongue.

35:01.915 --> 35:04.149
Now let's remain
lady-like, shall we?

35:06.353 --> 35:08.854
Shall we leave you in the dark?

35:08.856 --> 35:10.356
No, no, no just...

35:10.358 --> 35:12.691
I'm sorry.
I'm just really hungry.

35:12.693 --> 35:13.892
Shut up!

35:14.894 --> 35:16.629
Now do as I say.

35:17.964 --> 35:20.766
Go to chair and sit.

35:29.676 --> 35:30.943
Who's a dirty girl?

35:33.113 --> 35:34.847
Who's a dirty girl?

35:35.882 --> 35:38.884
Please just tell me
what you want me to do.

35:38.886 --> 35:40.886
Who's a dirty girl,
you little slut?

35:43.990 --> 35:45.057
Me.

35:47.127 --> 35:48.193
Me!

36:03.843 --> 36:04.910
Mmm...

37:03.203 --> 37:05.270
We gotta get out of here, okay?

37:09.209 --> 37:11.877
Easy, easy.

37:14.080 --> 37:15.748
Okay.

37:19.185 --> 37:20.953
Help me.

37:20.955 --> 37:24.056
Please don't leave.
You have to help me, okay?

37:24.058 --> 37:26.158
I wish...

37:27.193 --> 37:30.763
You can make it. Go.

37:30.765 --> 37:32.798
I can't go.

37:32.800 --> 37:35.234
I can't go!
Go.

37:35.236 --> 37:37.870
Michelle...
I can't go!

37:38.972 --> 37:40.305
Go.

37:40.307 --> 37:41.774
I'm sorry.

37:45.278 --> 37:46.979
You can make it.

37:47.981 --> 37:49.148
You can make it.

38:08.301 --> 38:10.135
You left me there, Michelle.

38:11.137 --> 38:12.204
Lauren.

38:14.808 --> 38:16.542
It wasn't my fault, Lauren.

38:25.952 --> 38:28.020
Help, please!

38:28.022 --> 38:30.923
I was worried they put too
much medicine in your food.

38:32.960 --> 38:37.095
My brother and sister are angry,
that's all.

38:38.565 --> 38:41.166
I need to...
I need to get up.

38:41.168 --> 38:43.368
Here, I can help.

38:44.604 --> 38:46.171
What is it?

38:46.173 --> 38:47.272
You sniff this.

38:48.976 --> 38:53.145
It'll make the nightmares go away.

39:02.155 --> 39:03.388
Feel better?

39:04.624 --> 39:05.991
Mmm...

39:07.126 --> 39:08.961
Do you want to see my scar?

39:10.864 --> 39:14.867
I saw yours and that's how
I knew we would be friends.

39:18.271 --> 39:20.272
I haven't shown this to anyone,

39:22.275 --> 39:24.176
but we have a real connection

39:28.081 --> 39:30.115
I got this a long time ago.

39:37.657 --> 39:39.157
That's right, Daniel.

39:40.393 --> 39:42.094
We have a connection.

39:44.364 --> 39:46.431
You want to be friends, right?

39:49.669 --> 39:54.072
We need to help each other
get out of here, together.

39:58.044 --> 40:00.045
I don't think that can happen.

40:00.047 --> 40:03.415
That's between Larry and Rachel.

40:03.417 --> 40:05.984
We can stay here, though.

40:05.986 --> 40:08.453
You people are fucking crazy!

40:08.455 --> 40:12.124
Don't call me that.
That is not nice.

40:14.193 --> 40:17.329
This is our funhouse,
like my brother said.

40:19.966 --> 40:21.166
Daniel?

40:22.402 --> 40:24.970
Larry, please.
I was just...

40:36.683 --> 40:38.150
You see what you've done to him?

40:44.157 --> 40:46.091
Michelle...

40:46.093 --> 40:47.960
<i>Wakey-wakey.</i>

40:53.433 --> 40:55.267
<i>Since you bullied my brother...</i>

40:56.369 --> 40:58.170
<i>Now I'm gonna bully you.</i>

40:59.973 --> 41:01.239
I didn't bully him.

41:13.186 --> 41:14.252
<i>Choose.</i>

41:16.456 --> 41:19.024
I don't want to.

41:19.026 --> 41:20.492
<i>Choose or you get both.</i>

41:23.329 --> 41:24.396
<i>Hmm?</i>

41:25.999 --> 41:27.099
<i>Okay.</i>

43:44.604 --> 43:46.138
Michelle?

44:22.909 --> 44:24.342
No!

44:29.415 --> 44:31.416
Larry, she's getting away!

45:09.522 --> 45:11.756
Larry!
Help me!

45:16.495 --> 45:19.598
Don't go!
Please, come back.

45:19.600 --> 45:21.299
No!

45:48.995 --> 45:52.264
Just wait till your sister
gets home, you moron!

45:57.637 --> 46:01.205
All right, little girl.
There's no way out!

47:10.343 --> 47:11.676
Help!

47:14.513 --> 47:15.747
Help me, please!

47:19.752 --> 47:21.386
Help me.

47:26.525 --> 47:28.460
Okay.

47:28.462 --> 47:30.462
Help.

47:34.834 --> 47:36.835
What did he do?

47:36.837 --> 47:39.604
He helped one of them with food.

47:42.508 --> 47:44.409
She's in the ceiling...

47:44.411 --> 47:45.677
Like a little bitch.

47:45.679 --> 47:47.412
A little rat bitch!

47:50.416 --> 47:51.783
But he's sorry now.

47:51.785 --> 47:52.851
Right, Daniel?

47:54.887 --> 47:56.521
You can turn around.

48:01.460 --> 48:02.894
I'll get the whore.

48:02.896 --> 48:04.662
Don't bother.

48:04.664 --> 48:06.965
She can't escape.
I made sure.

48:09.135 --> 48:10.769
She'll be down soon enough.

48:12.671 --> 48:16.474
There's someone down the hallway
who needs your attention.

48:16.476 --> 48:18.009
Oh, yeah, right.

49:27.613 --> 49:28.880
Oh, my God.

49:30.916 --> 49:32.050
Is that Jean?

49:33.219 --> 49:34.486
Jean.

49:46.632 --> 49:50.502
I don't get it, Daniel.
What's gotten into you?

49:51.971 --> 49:53.905
Is it the new whore?

49:55.241 --> 49:58.743
Is it her dirty body?

49:58.745 --> 49:59.811
Parts?

50:01.046 --> 50:03.248
I could cut them off?

50:03.250 --> 50:05.650
Give them to you as an
early birthday present?

50:05.652 --> 50:07.018
No, Larry.

50:07.020 --> 50:09.053
That's not...

50:10.556 --> 50:14.058
Honestly, Daniel, I sometimes
despair for your soul.

50:22.701 --> 50:24.401
Are you worried about this?

50:25.738 --> 50:28.006
You don't need to
worry about this.

50:28.008 --> 50:29.841
It's for the dirty sinners.

50:32.678 --> 50:34.145
Are you a dirty sinner, Daniel?

50:51.330 --> 50:52.797
No, you're no sinner.

50:54.333 --> 50:56.634
You're the most innocent of us.

50:57.636 --> 50:59.938
Too innocent, hmm?

51:02.909 --> 51:06.844
A little pain to remind
you of what's important.

51:08.347 --> 51:09.781
We're family, Daniel.

51:09.783 --> 51:11.583
It's all about the family, hmm?

51:15.921 --> 51:17.121
I love you.

51:26.932 --> 51:28.066
Jean?

51:30.936 --> 51:32.003
Okay.

51:33.906 --> 51:34.973
Come on.

51:36.809 --> 51:38.743
Come on.

51:43.849 --> 51:45.049
<i>Larry!</i>

51:49.021 --> 51:50.822
<i>Tickle Rachel.</i>

51:50.824 --> 51:52.156
<i>Tickle Daniel!</i>

51:52.158 --> 51:54.826
<i>Tickle Daniel!
Daniel!</i>

51:56.363 --> 51:59.030
<i>Be nice, boys!
Play nice. Play nice.</i>

51:59.965 --> 52:02.634
<i>Now children, who has sinned?</i>

52:03.669 --> 52:05.069
<i>We have, Mother.</i>

52:05.071 --> 52:07.405
<i>And who needs to be purged?</i>

52:07.407 --> 52:09.807
<i>We all need purging.</i>

52:09.809 --> 52:11.976
<i>Remember that.</i>

52:11.978 --> 52:14.846
What were you doing
in your room, Daniel?

52:14.848 --> 52:16.014
<i>Nothing, Mother.</i>

52:16.016 --> 52:18.116
Idle hands are the
Devil's playground.

52:18.118 --> 52:20.852
You were looking at these
comics again, weren't you?

52:23.756 --> 52:25.023
<i>Is this a funhouse?</i>

52:25.991 --> 52:29.927
Do you know what God told
King David in the Bible?

52:29.929 --> 52:33.665
<i>He said, "Fear not.
And show courage."</i>

52:34.900 --> 52:37.969
<i>"For your Father is
with you always."</i>

52:37.971 --> 52:40.772
<i>Your superheroes act
bravely, Daniel.</i>

52:40.774 --> 52:42.206
<i>It's what makes them special.</i>

52:42.208 --> 52:45.176
You're a little coward,
aren't you?

52:45.178 --> 52:46.744
Open your shirt.

52:46.746 --> 52:48.846
<i>Mother, please!
Open your shirt!</i>

52:48.848 --> 52:50.882
<i>Now! Now!</i>

52:52.918 --> 52:53.985
<i>Open.</i>

52:59.158 --> 53:00.758
Oh, my God.

53:00.760 --> 53:02.226
<i>What are you telling me?</i>

53:02.228 --> 53:03.795
<i>I started to bleed.</i>

53:05.831 --> 53:07.932
<i>From your private area?</i>

53:07.934 --> 53:10.068
<i>I hoped you wouldn't
be touched by this.</i>

53:10.070 --> 53:12.003
<i>But you're a dirty little girl.</i>

53:13.238 --> 53:14.806
<i>Say it!</i>

53:16.442 --> 53:18.176
What are you?
<i>A dirty girl.</i>

53:18.178 --> 53:20.845
I can't hear you.
<i>A dirty girl!</i>

53:20.847 --> 53:22.980
<i>A dirty girl.</i>

53:22.982 --> 53:25.183
<i>Thankless child...</i>

53:25.185 --> 53:27.919
You were supposed to put
together Mother's table.

53:32.458 --> 53:33.958
You didn't do it right.

53:36.028 --> 53:37.762
Mother got hurt.

53:37.764 --> 53:40.932
<i>I'm sorry, Mother.
That's all right.</i>

53:40.934 --> 53:44.135
<i>But I think you know God's law.
What is it?</i>

53:45.204 --> 53:47.038
<i>An eye for an eye.</i>

53:49.508 --> 53:51.275
<i>I'm sorry, my child.</i>

53:52.244 --> 53:54.746
This is painful for me as well,

53:54.748 --> 53:56.314
but you made your bed.

53:58.784 --> 54:00.785
Now you have to lie in it.

54:00.787 --> 54:03.020
<i>Mother, no!</i>

54:03.989 --> 54:05.156
Oh, my God.

54:11.964 --> 54:13.030
Ugh!

54:42.828 --> 54:45.062
You have to confess.

54:45.064 --> 54:46.264
Are you a sinner?

54:47.833 --> 54:49.066
Are you a sinner?

54:51.036 --> 54:54.005
No.
I am not a sinner.

54:54.007 --> 54:57.241
Hmm?
But you are a sinner.

54:57.243 --> 55:00.278
And you must confess your
sins in order to be free.

55:05.250 --> 55:07.852
I am a sinner.

55:07.854 --> 55:11.122
I want you to say it louder,
so you can get purged.

55:12.291 --> 55:14.225
I am a sinner.
Louder.

55:14.227 --> 55:16.027
I am a sinner.
Louder.

55:16.029 --> 55:17.595
I am a sinner.
Louder.

55:17.597 --> 55:19.363
I am a sinner...

56:44.283 --> 56:45.349
Jean.

56:47.920 --> 56:48.986
Jean!

57:00.332 --> 57:01.465
Jean!

57:01.467 --> 57:04.168
You're gonna be okay!

57:04.170 --> 57:05.236
Oh, my God.

57:12.144 --> 57:14.946
Come on, baby.
Come on!

57:16.248 --> 57:18.349
Come on!
We're gonna go.

57:18.351 --> 57:19.550
You're making it.

57:28.127 --> 57:29.360
I can't do...

57:40.172 --> 57:41.640
Back pocket!

57:46.112 --> 57:47.178
Michelle!

58:23.348 --> 58:24.415
Ssh...

58:25.450 --> 58:27.218
You've been a very bad girl.

58:29.488 --> 58:33.290
But everything's gonna
be okay now.

58:37.429 --> 58:39.630
I'm gonna get the dirty
girl back to normal.

58:44.536 --> 58:47.071
Pretty girl. Ssh.

58:47.073 --> 58:48.339
Mommy loves you.

58:50.776 --> 58:53.644
You are one resourceful girl.

58:59.117 --> 59:00.451
Shoes are important.

59:02.154 --> 59:04.789
Usually we take much longer.

59:04.791 --> 59:07.058
Seeing it takes time to purge.

59:07.060 --> 59:11.462
But since you messed up our
schedule with your stunt.

59:22.307 --> 59:23.474
Choose.

59:30.149 --> 59:32.216
Choose, or you get both.

59:45.297 --> 59:46.497
Time to purge.

01:00:03.182 --> 01:00:04.315
Praise the Lord.

01:00:07.552 --> 01:00:09.587
I knew from the first
moment I saw you,

01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:11.188
how rotten you were.

01:00:13.325 --> 01:00:14.492
Confess.

01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:19.330
When your mother tells you
to do something, you do it!

01:00:22.534 --> 01:00:24.135
I confess.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:26.237
For what?

01:00:28.507 --> 01:00:30.174
For killing my friends.

01:00:31.476 --> 01:00:35.279
Not your dirty whore friends.
I'm talking about me.

01:00:37.215 --> 01:00:38.682
What do you confess to me?

01:00:44.222 --> 01:00:46.624
The dirty girl just
doesn't get it, does she?

01:00:46.626 --> 01:00:48.159
Apparently not.

01:01:01.473 --> 01:01:02.573
We'll be back.

01:01:03.642 --> 01:01:05.643
Don't go anywhere.

01:01:05.645 --> 01:01:07.478
I have a new friend to attend to.

01:01:20.325 --> 01:01:21.525
Handle this.

01:01:26.431 --> 01:01:27.498
Come here.

01:01:30.635 --> 01:01:32.303
You know what to do.

01:01:34.406 --> 01:01:36.240
I'll be there in a few minutes.

01:01:59.364 --> 01:02:00.798
You really messed up.

01:02:04.769 --> 01:02:06.670
I wanted to be friends.

01:02:08.573 --> 01:02:10.307
Why couldn't you do it?

01:02:24.456 --> 01:02:27.758
When we met, I was nice to you...

01:02:29.327 --> 01:02:31.328
Because I thought
you were special.

01:02:32.497 --> 01:02:34.598
I thought you would
understand me.

01:02:36.368 --> 01:02:38.335
And then I saw your scar...

01:02:39.404 --> 01:02:42.273
And I knew we had
a real connection.

01:02:57.422 --> 01:02:58.722
Larry?

01:02:58.724 --> 01:03:00.491
Hi. Kristen, right?

01:03:00.493 --> 01:03:02.793
Yeah, you said, uh, 2:00.

01:03:02.795 --> 01:03:06.497
I did, you know,
it's the darnedest thing.

01:03:06.499 --> 01:03:09.300
We had a scheduling problem
with yesterday's model.

01:03:10.402 --> 01:03:12.636
I know, I know,
it's such a bummer.

01:03:12.638 --> 01:03:14.705
Do you think we could
reschedule tomorrow?

01:03:17.709 --> 01:03:20.444
No, but Mother always said,

01:03:20.446 --> 01:03:23.314
you can't trust a pretty girl.

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:24.548
I know that now.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:25.616
No, please!

01:03:30.789 --> 01:03:34.658
Oh, don't be such a coward!
A baby!

01:03:34.660 --> 01:03:37.061
No, let me tell you, Mother!

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:38.829
No, let me tell you, Daniel.

01:03:40.765 --> 01:03:42.433
Let Mother speak.

01:03:43.802 --> 01:03:45.602
You know what I always say.

01:03:47.472 --> 01:03:50.341
That courage is the
most important thing.

01:03:50.343 --> 01:03:53.711
And that what makes a superhero
special, is their bravery.

01:03:56.414 --> 01:03:58.549
And you've been very brave.

01:04:00.418 --> 01:04:03.554
You've proven that you
could stand up to Mother

01:04:03.556 --> 01:04:05.089
and be your own man.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:07.491
I'm so sorry, Daniel!

01:04:14.833 --> 01:04:16.934
Now come, give Mother a hug.

01:04:30.382 --> 01:04:32.383
I may have to work tomorrow.

01:04:32.385 --> 01:04:34.885
I was really psyched about
getting the photos today.

01:04:34.887 --> 01:04:36.653
I promise I'll pay you double

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:38.422
and we'll give you extra shots.

01:04:38.424 --> 01:04:39.923
Huh? Just for being
such a sweetheart?

01:04:44.129 --> 01:04:45.529
I'm so sorry.

01:05:21.199 --> 01:05:23.700
Okay.
Thanks, Kristen.

01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:26.470
Tomorrow, I promise you,
a shoot you'll never forget.

01:06:20.758 --> 01:06:21.825
No!

01:06:52.790 --> 01:06:53.857
Daniel...

01:07:01.032 --> 01:07:02.533
Rachel!

01:07:03.801 --> 01:07:04.968
Rachel!

01:07:58.224 --> 01:08:01.124
The Lord is my shepherd.
And I shall not want.

01:08:01.126 --> 01:08:03.627
He leadeth me to the soul...

01:08:40.698 --> 01:08:41.999
I'm with you.

01:08:42.001 --> 01:08:43.966
Are you okay?
Huh?

01:08:59.082 --> 01:09:00.149
Okay.

01:09:14.899 --> 01:09:16.167
Let's go this way.
