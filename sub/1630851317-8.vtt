00:02.741 --> 00:04.047
<i>Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...</i>

00:04.091 --> 00:05.309
I am taking the day

00:05.353 --> 00:07.442
to explore new
employment opportunities

00:07.485 --> 00:10.053
outside of MaxDot.

00:10.097 --> 00:13.100
I feel
I am underappreciated here,

00:13.143 --> 00:14.492
and would like

00:14.536 --> 00:17.278
to find a place that...

00:17.321 --> 00:19.454
values me.

00:19.497 --> 00:20.933
Christina has left.

00:20.977 --> 00:21.978
Now you will need

00:22.022 --> 00:23.284
to replace her

00:23.327 --> 00:24.981
with someone qualified,

00:25.025 --> 00:26.983
who has great knowledge of
the workings of the company.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.202
That's exactly right.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.073
I usually am.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.466
Congratulations, Kofo.

00:31.509 --> 00:32.684
Excuse me?

00:32.728 --> 00:34.469
Mr. Wheeler, you said "Kofo."

00:34.512 --> 00:37.124
My name is "Goodwin."

00:37.167 --> 00:41.215
I know, but Kofo came up
with the outlet store idea.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.478
Plus, he worked with
Christina rebranding

00:43.521 --> 00:46.568
our socks, and she left him
a glowing recommendation.

00:46.611 --> 00:48.309
You want Kofo?

00:48.352 --> 00:50.702
The Kofo that sleeps
in my garage?

00:50.746 --> 00:53.227
Yes, Goodwin.
We need you down on the floor.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.924
You're our guy.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.839
Your floor guy.

00:59.189 --> 01:01.148
Douglas, I need you

01:01.191 --> 01:02.453
to process some returns.

01:02.497 --> 01:05.326
Well, since you
asked so nicely.

01:05.369 --> 01:09.156
It's weird not having
Kofo working with us.

01:09.199 --> 01:11.941
- It is fine.
- You guys were like
Batman and Robin.

01:11.984 --> 01:14.161
- Mm-hmm.
- And Bob went and
promoted Robin.

01:14.204 --> 01:16.293
Unless...

01:16.337 --> 01:18.295
Was Kofo Batman all along?

01:18.339 --> 01:20.254
I am Batman.

01:21.037 --> 01:23.518
We need more tape.

01:23.561 --> 01:26.173
You should have been the one
to get the gig, if you ask me.

01:26.216 --> 01:28.131
- I did not ask you.
- You've been here
longer than Kofo.

01:28.175 --> 01:30.177
Hell, you've been
here longer than Bob.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.179
What's it been--
20 years?

01:32.222 --> 01:33.919
Twenty-five.

01:33.963 --> 01:35.573
I don't know
how you do it.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.358
People come,
and people go,

01:37.401 --> 01:40.012
and you're always
right here.

01:40.056 --> 01:42.189
Year after year after year.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.321
Please, stop.

01:44.365 --> 01:45.801
It's comforting,
really, knowing

01:45.844 --> 01:47.150
no matter where
life takes you,

01:47.194 --> 01:48.412
you can always come back

01:48.456 --> 01:49.761
to this warehouse,
and snap a selfie

01:49.805 --> 01:51.546
in front of
Mount Goodwin.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.984
- Where do I put these?
- Put what?

01:55.027 --> 01:59.162
Hold them in the tunnel so I can
see what you are referencing.

01:59.206 --> 02:02.165
You okay?
You don't look so good.

02:02.209 --> 02:03.949
I'm fine.

02:03.993 --> 02:06.735
Hey, check out the new
marketing director.

02:06.778 --> 02:09.085
- Looking good, Kofo.
- Thank you.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.957
I hope you don't mind, Cousin,
but I borrowed your suit.

02:12.001 --> 02:14.177
That one is my favorite.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.397
Make sure to bury me in it.

02:17.398 --> 02:18.834
Goodwin!

02:51.475 --> 02:52.476
What happened?

02:52.520 --> 02:54.391
You passed out at work.

02:54.435 --> 02:55.784
Oh. Is it serious?

02:55.827 --> 02:58.090
Maybe I should get the doctor.

02:58.134 --> 02:59.091
Oh. Tell me.

02:59.135 --> 03:01.398
Goodwin,

03:01.442 --> 03:03.705
there is no easy way
to say this.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.143
You had a...

03:07.187 --> 03:08.927
panic attack.

03:08.971 --> 03:11.408
No.

03:11.452 --> 03:13.889
Surely it must be something
more serious.

03:13.932 --> 03:16.283
I'm sorry. We ran all the tests.

03:16.326 --> 03:17.371
Your body is fine.

03:17.414 --> 03:19.721
The issue is...

03:19.764 --> 03:22.506
psychological.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.334
Impossible.

03:24.378 --> 03:27.250
Nigerians do not have
psychological issues.

03:27.294 --> 03:28.643
What will I tell my family?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.253
I'm sure they'll understand.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.168
Would you understand?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.301
No.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.401
Do not worry, Tiwa.

03:47.444 --> 03:50.055
I will do the right thing
for you and the children.

03:50.099 --> 03:51.753
What are you talking about?

03:51.796 --> 03:54.364
God forbid,
you need a new husband,

03:54.408 --> 03:56.497
I will be happy
to step into that role.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.890
I will be happy
to step off a bridge

03:58.934 --> 04:00.457
before marrying you.

04:00.501 --> 04:03.286
Because I would always
remind you of Goodwin.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.463
Because you would
always remind me of you.

04:06.507 --> 04:07.682
Tiwa, hey.

04:07.725 --> 04:09.858
Hello.

04:09.901 --> 04:12.208
I'm so sorry to see you again
- under these circumstances.
- Ah.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.345
Tiwa, what a lovely thing
to say about Mr. Wheeler.

04:18.388 --> 04:20.477
Nice try, Kofo,
but I got the gist.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.003
Ah.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.877
That one I didn't get.

04:28.920 --> 04:31.271
Nothing.
Just more pleasantries.

04:32.489 --> 04:34.186
There he is.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.062
Oh.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.514
So is he gonna be all right?

04:57.558 --> 04:59.124
I'll tell you later.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.605
Let him finish
lying to his wife.

05:07.568 --> 05:09.396
Hello, Mother.

05:09.439 --> 05:13.008
What are you doing here?
I thought you quit the family.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.706
I did not quit the family.
I quit the business.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.752
Same difference.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.189
Bob asked me
to give you a ride home.

05:20.232 --> 05:22.496
He's still at the hospital
with Goodwin.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.149
How is Goodwin?

05:24.193 --> 05:26.195
- He's gonna be fine.
- Good.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.371
Because I care about the people
that work for me,

05:28.415 --> 05:29.807
and don't betray me.

05:30.808 --> 05:32.941
I didn't betray you.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.856
Mm-hmm.

05:34.899 --> 05:38.642
But I did
what I had to do for myself,

05:38.686 --> 05:42.472
and I'm so glad
because it's really paying off.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.996
Wait. You got a job already?

05:45.040 --> 05:47.390
Yes. I have a job...

05:47.434 --> 05:52.003
finding a new job,
which really is a full-time job.

05:52.047 --> 05:55.616
Got it. You ain't working.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.008
What are you doing?

05:57.052 --> 05:59.097
Saving you the embarrassment
of asking.

05:59.141 --> 06:01.578
Mom, I do not want your money.

06:01.622 --> 06:02.884
Just take it.

06:02.927 --> 06:05.626
- No.
- You don't have

06:05.669 --> 06:07.454
to cash it right away,
but you'll feel better

06:07.497 --> 06:10.413
knowing it's in your purse,
like ChapStick

06:10.457 --> 06:12.415
or a handgun.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.114
Okay, that makes sense.

06:18.682 --> 06:21.337
We should do this once a week.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.600
Our own little super club.

06:23.644 --> 06:24.645
- Yeah.
Yes.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.298
That way,
we can make sure

06:26.342 --> 06:27.778
that you are both
- eating well.
- Mm-hmm.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.650
Bob, you are looking very thin.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.652
Oh, thank you.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.697
I'm actually just doing
smaller portions these days.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.830
Uh, Abishola,

06:35.873 --> 06:39.094
a fat husband is
a happy husband.

06:41.270 --> 06:44.839
That no other woman wants.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.449
So, Bob,

06:46.493 --> 06:47.624
how is work?

06:47.668 --> 06:51.149
Tell us tales
of socks and glory.

06:51.193 --> 06:53.500
Well, work's a little weird
right now.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.676
I heard Goodwin had
an attack of the panic.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.679
She did not hear it from me.

06:58.722 --> 07:00.550
It's on Kemi's Facebook.

07:01.682 --> 07:04.293
<i>She</i> heard it from me.

07:05.512 --> 07:07.601
He's having a hard time
with Kofo's promotion.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.603
I tried to explain it to him.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.821
Why would you do that?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.388
Well, because he's upset.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.737
Why do you care?

07:13.781 --> 07:17.393
Bob wants his employees
to like him.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.569
Oh, Bob.

07:19.613 --> 07:20.918
What? It's a family company.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.529
I want them to feel like family.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.705
- And you tell them this?
- Of course.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.403
No wonder they are
so soft and panicky.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.665
And happy.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.537
It is a factory.

07:30.580 --> 07:32.626
What are you,
Willy Wonka?

07:33.583 --> 07:36.630
Can we please
just talk about something else?

07:36.673 --> 07:38.545
So, Abishola,

07:38.588 --> 07:39.676
how is your work?

07:39.720 --> 07:41.591
Oh, yesterday,

07:41.635 --> 07:43.288
we had a three-hour mandatory

07:43.332 --> 07:44.725
sensitivity training.

07:44.768 --> 07:46.509
Sensitivity to what?

07:46.553 --> 07:47.684
To each other.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.165
The whole world has gone mad.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.172
I'm just feeling
a little rudderless.

07:57.215 --> 07:59.566
I mean, I know I have
a toolset, but...

07:59.609 --> 08:01.959
sometimes I feel
like I left them out in the yard

08:02.003 --> 08:03.657
and they got all rusty.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.310
Does that make sense?

08:05.354 --> 08:06.573
No.

08:06.616 --> 08:09.097
I've only ever had
one job in my life

08:09.140 --> 08:10.751
and it was given to me
by my mommy

08:10.794 --> 08:13.580
and I don't know
what I'm gonna do next.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.104
I understand that.

08:16.147 --> 08:17.932
When my husband died
and left me nothing,

08:17.975 --> 08:21.196
I was also... rudderless.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.589
What did you do?

08:22.632 --> 08:24.373
I grew a rudder.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.332
I could not afford a caterer
for his funeral,

08:27.376 --> 08:29.204
so I did all the cooking myself.

08:29.247 --> 08:30.988
And of course...

08:31.032 --> 08:32.816
I was amazing at it.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.123
That's nice.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.646
He helped you find your passion

08:36.690 --> 08:38.561
by dying
and leaving you nothing.

08:39.475 --> 08:41.042
Well, I'm not lucky enough

08:41.085 --> 08:43.435
to be poor
and have a dead husband.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.046
Christina.

08:45.089 --> 08:48.049
There is only one person who
can tell you should do next.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.616
Me.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.574
No. The Babalawo.

08:51.618 --> 08:52.923
The baba-who?

08:52.967 --> 08:54.446
He's a Yoruba priest

08:54.490 --> 08:55.970
who ascertains the future

08:56.013 --> 08:57.841
through communicating
with the spirit world.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.278
Oh, my God.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.672
That is exactly
who I need to talk to.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.030
There he is!

09:13.074 --> 09:14.379
Welcome back, buddy.

09:16.643 --> 09:19.210
Hello, everyone. I'm fine.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.517
They were all worried
about you, Cousin.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.997
There was nothing
to worry about.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.738
It was just a mild heart attack.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.087
I thought it was a panic attack.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.263
Of the heart-- are you a doctor?

09:28.306 --> 09:31.179
- No.
- Then do not speak of this!

09:31.222 --> 09:33.224
Back to work, everyone!

09:33.268 --> 09:34.878
Hang on, hang on.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.489
Now we're all thrilled
Goodwin's back,

09:37.533 --> 09:39.274
but let his little episode
serve as a reminder

09:39.317 --> 09:40.667
mental health matters!

09:40.710 --> 09:42.494
Oh, dear God.

09:42.538 --> 09:44.845
Now if any of you are feeling
too stressed,

09:44.888 --> 09:46.455
I want you to listen
to your bodies,

09:46.498 --> 09:48.631
and take a break so you
don't faint like Goodwin.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.851
And while he's recovering

09:50.894 --> 09:53.767
he's going to be
on "light duty."

09:53.810 --> 09:55.682
Okay? I see him lift anything

09:55.725 --> 09:58.249
over ten pounds,
it'll be your asses.

10:00.121 --> 10:01.557
I am not wearing this.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.689
Look, I know it's a pain,

10:02.732 --> 10:04.125
but it's for your own good.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.605
And insurance purposes.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.478
I would like to be allowed
to do my job.

10:09.521 --> 10:11.219
Well, right now
your job is to get better.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.569
You start feeling shaky,
you take a break.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.657
I refuse.

10:14.701 --> 10:17.138
It wasn't really a request.

10:17.181 --> 10:19.053
It was an order.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.576
I refuse the order.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.708
Come on, man,
don't be like that.

10:21.751 --> 10:23.666
We're a family here.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.234
What are you going to do,
put me in a timeout, Papa?

10:26.277 --> 10:27.670
You know what? Yeah.

10:27.714 --> 10:28.932
Grab your stuff--
you're going home!

10:28.976 --> 10:30.760
Fine!

10:36.200 --> 10:38.289
Can I go home, Papa?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.682
Not today.

10:40.727 --> 10:42.250
Not today.

10:42.293 --> 10:44.339
No!

10:52.956 --> 10:55.306
It is such an honor

10:55.350 --> 10:58.353
to be in front
of a real Yoruba priest.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.573
I am but a messenger for Ifa,
our God of wisdom.

11:01.617 --> 11:03.271
I'm also a notary, if you have

11:03.314 --> 11:04.881
any documents
that need guidance.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.537
So how do we start this?

11:08.580 --> 11:10.757
Do you need a lock of my hair?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.759
Also, if it helps, I am

11:12.802 --> 11:14.804
easily hypnotized.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.937
Just take the
divination chain

11:16.980 --> 11:18.721
and express any
questions you have

11:18.765 --> 11:20.723
for Ifa to the Babalawo.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.420
And I will place the chain
on the divination board

11:22.464 --> 11:25.728
so Ifa can send his answer
back to me.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.643
Let me show you.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.515
Is Chukwuemeka my soul mate?

11:30.559 --> 11:32.126
- Kemi.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.737
you ask this every week,
and the answer is always no.

11:34.781 --> 11:35.782
Ask again!

11:43.703 --> 11:45.182
Ooh! Oh, this is interesting.

11:45.226 --> 11:46.314
What?

11:46.357 --> 11:47.707
He says no again.

11:49.143 --> 11:50.884
I should just go to the Babalawo
by the airport.

11:50.927 --> 11:52.799
He only tells you
what you want to hear.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.191
Exactly.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.455
Christina, go ahead.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.159
Oh, holy Ifa...

12:06.638 --> 12:09.163
...please tell me
if I made a huge mistake

12:09.206 --> 12:10.773
quitting my job

12:10.817 --> 12:13.080
or if I'm on the right path.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.866
♪ Amen.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.281
Ifa says you cannot move forward

12:40.324 --> 12:42.457
because something
is holding you back.

12:43.675 --> 12:45.939
Some dark force.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.157
Like a demon?

12:48.289 --> 12:49.899
Is Christina possessed?

12:51.901 --> 12:53.207
It is not <i>in</i> you.

12:53.250 --> 12:54.469
Oh.

12:54.991 --> 12:56.427
But it is <i>near</i> you.

12:58.342 --> 13:00.257
Is it me?

13:01.519 --> 13:03.043
It has hair of yellow.

13:04.348 --> 13:05.828
And the voice of a crow.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.615
Oh, my God.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.313
- What?
- What?

13:12.356 --> 13:14.924
The yellow crow is my mother.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.319
Okay, my turn.

13:24.673 --> 13:26.718
Kofo.
Oh!

13:27.502 --> 13:28.895
Hello, Cousin.

13:28.938 --> 13:29.896
You startled me.

13:29.939 --> 13:31.854
I am hiding from my wife.

13:31.898 --> 13:34.291
Because she emasculates you
and makes you feel small?

13:34.335 --> 13:37.468
Because I was sent home early
and I do not want her to know.

13:37.512 --> 13:40.123
Because she emasculates you
and makes you feel small.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.908
Just shut up!

13:43.126 --> 13:44.867
I'm going to stay here
a little longer.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.913
Take as much time as you need.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.524
As long as you don't mind me
finishing my jigsaw puzzle.

13:49.567 --> 13:52.527
Why do you do
these stupid things?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
They are very calming
after a long day.

13:54.964 --> 13:57.010
Oh, ridiculous.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.886
It is called
"Dogs, Dogs, Dogs."

14:05.757 --> 14:07.107
You are good at this.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.935
Yes, I am.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.939
You are good at
so many things.

14:12.982 --> 14:15.724
And just because I am better
than you at one thing,

14:15.767 --> 14:17.813
does not take away all
the things you are good at.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.293
Just shut up
and do the puzzle.

14:25.386 --> 14:27.431
And thank you.

14:33.437 --> 14:36.266
<i>Thank you so much for helping.</i>

14:36.310 --> 14:38.486
If the Babalawo thinks
this will be good for you,

14:38.529 --> 14:40.096
then I do, too.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.706
For the record, i-it's not

14:41.750 --> 14:44.100
that I feel my mother is evil,

14:44.144 --> 14:46.842
it's more
like her hold on me is evil.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.932
This will cover you either way.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.281
Oh, good.

14:51.325 --> 14:53.370
All right, let's do this.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.941
Is there a chant?

14:58.985 --> 15:01.117
- No.
- Can I do one?

15:01.161 --> 15:02.162
It cannot hurt.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.207
Ah, okay.

15:04.251 --> 15:06.166

so I can
fully embrace my future.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.585
Oh, for crying out loud.

15:34.629 --> 15:37.066
Actually, Mom,

15:37.110 --> 15:39.025
since you're up.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.026
What's that?

- Mm-hmm.

15:50.036 --> 15:53.256
Okay, clearly I'm still asleep.

15:54.910 --> 15:57.695
Mom, I love you, but I can't

16:01.134 --> 16:02.439
I'm not taking back the check.

16:02.483 --> 16:04.180
You need it.

16:04.224 --> 16:06.182
Well, then, I'm just gonna
set this right here.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.577
So this is what I get
for trying to help you.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.405
Now you want
to cut me out of your life.

16:11.448 --> 16:14.016
No, that's not what I am doing.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.149
All I ever wanted was
what's best for you.

16:16.192 --> 16:20.022
I know that's what you think,
but it's done the opposite.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.632
You may not want to hear this,
but I think

16:21.676 --> 16:23.634
you turned out pretty okay.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.375
You do?

16:25.419 --> 16:27.812
And I hate
that you don't see that.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.728
Me, too.

16:30.772 --> 16:32.469
I'm sorry
I want to take care of you,

16:32.513 --> 16:35.037
but you're my baby girl.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.952
And I always will be.

16:41.087 --> 16:43.480
All right, ladies,

16:43.524 --> 16:45.178
even though
we are on light duty,

16:45.221 --> 16:47.658
that does not mean
we take our duties lightly.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.878
We are the last line

16:49.921 --> 16:52.750
of defense between this company
and a substandard sock.

16:52.794 --> 16:55.927
So grab your stickers
and find those irregularities!

16:55.971 --> 16:58.278
Are you gonna be
like this all day?

16:58.321 --> 17:00.497
- Like what?
- Never mind.

17:02.456 --> 17:03.979
What are you doing?

17:04.023 --> 17:05.676
Admiring my cousin's spirit.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.548
He may be broken
on the inside,

17:07.591 --> 17:09.158
but you would
never know it.

17:09.202 --> 17:11.073
How bad is it?

17:11.117 --> 17:13.423
Last night, we did
a jigsaw puzzle together.

17:13.467 --> 17:16.122
Ah, geez.

17:16.165 --> 17:17.297
Found one!

17:17.340 --> 17:19.125
Very good, Shirley.

17:19.168 --> 17:21.301
I would have never spotted
that flawed gusset.

17:21.344 --> 17:24.130
And I'm blind in one eye.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.960
Excuse me, ladies,
can you give us a minute?

17:29.004 --> 17:30.136
Uh, take some socks with you.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.268
Whatever.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.492
You know,

17:38.535 --> 17:40.320
you and I are the only two

17:40.363 --> 17:42.452
who can do every job
in this company.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.367
Clearly not every job.

17:44.411 --> 17:46.891
All right.

17:46.935 --> 17:49.677
I'm sorry for the way
I handled promoting Kofo.

17:49.720 --> 17:51.113
I should've talked to you first.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.158
Nonsense.

17:52.201 --> 17:53.550
You are the boss.

17:53.594 --> 17:54.986
You have the right
to break the hearts

17:55.030 --> 17:56.901
of your employees.

17:56.945 --> 17:58.164
Look, it was a tough call,

17:58.207 --> 17:59.774
but you got to make
those decisions

17:59.817 --> 18:01.384
when you're in charge--
you'll see.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.299
What do you mean?

18:03.343 --> 18:05.258
One day, I'm gonna step aside

18:05.301 --> 18:07.173
and you're gonna be
the unfortunate soul

18:07.216 --> 18:08.522
that has to deal with it.

18:09.566 --> 18:12.003
You want me to be
in charge of MaxDot?

18:12.047 --> 18:13.788
Eventually.

18:13.831 --> 18:16.138
Who else can I trust
this place with, Douglas?

18:19.359 --> 18:21.317
Very funny, Mr. Wheeler.

18:21.361 --> 18:23.406
And I am honored.

18:23.450 --> 18:25.756
No, Goodwin.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.281
It's my honor.
Ah.

18:28.324 --> 18:29.543
So when?

18:29.586 --> 18:31.371
Huh?

18:31.414 --> 18:32.633
When will I be taking over?

18:32.676 --> 18:34.417
I don't know.
A few years, maybe.

18:34.461 --> 18:37.028
I will need you
to be more specific.

18:37.072 --> 18:39.030
And put it in writing.

18:45.428 --> 18:46.951
Big changes are coming,
ladies.

18:46.995 --> 18:48.344
You will see.

18:48.388 --> 18:50.216
But do not worry.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.174
After I come to power,

18:52.218 --> 18:55.395
I will remember those
who stood by me.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.180
Did you hit your head
when you fainted?

18:58.224 --> 19:01.183
Okay, Rita is out. Shirley,
you are my new number two.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.403
- What?
- I said, you're my number two!

19:03.446 --> 19:06.406
Go to lunch, back at 2:00.

19:09.235 --> 19:11.802
Rita!

19:11.846 --> 19:13.891
I have reconsidered.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.198
Your future is
once again bright.

19:16.242 --> 19:17.330
Whatever.

19:17.373 --> 19:20.115
Yes, indeed!

19:20.159 --> 19:22.378
Big changes coming.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.815
You definitely hit your head.
