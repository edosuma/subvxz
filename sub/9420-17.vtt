His professional name

03:40.554 --> 03:41.987

03:49.230 --> 03:51.129
Of you to let us help you,

03:51.131 --> 03:53.765
Because this is your coming out.

>> yeah.

03:54.768 --> 03:55.500
>> how are you feeling

03:55.502 --> 03:56.368
About that right now?

03:56.370 --> 03:57.035
>> honestly,

03:57.037 --> 03:58.837
I'm a little nervous.

03:58.839 --> 04:00.305
She's the only girl

04:00.307 --> 04:02.374
I've felt that way about.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.509
I still want to do it for myself

04:04.511 --> 04:06.211
And other haitian kids around,

04:06.213 --> 04:07.479
Because i know, like,

04:07.481 --> 04:09.214
Being gay is not something that

04:09.216 --> 04:11.016
We're supposed to think about.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.417
>> have you had relationships

04:12.419 --> 04:13.085
In the past?

04:13.087 --> 04:15.254
>> yeah. I've had a lot

04:15.256 --> 04:17.221
Of relationships with boys.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.390
I just got my heart

04:18.392 --> 04:19.757
Broken not too long ago.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.192
>> is emily the only woman

04:21.195 --> 04:22.160
You can see yourself with?

04:22.162 --> 04:23.362
>> yeah, she is,

04:23.364 --> 04:24.963
Because that's the only female

04:24.965 --> 04:26.331
That i've been "conversating"

04:26.333 --> 04:27.899
With on that type of level.

04:27.901 --> 04:29.735
>> how did you and emily meet?

04:29.737 --> 04:32.137
>> i contacted her when i had

04:32.139 --> 04:34.673
Gotten my heart broken by my ex.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.108
I was feeling gay for a day,

04:36.110 --> 04:36.842
So i'm like, "hey,

04:36.844 --> 04:38.176
Let me just be gay for a day

04:38.178 --> 04:39.511
And see what happens."

04:39.513 --> 04:40.178
I was just

04:40.180 --> 04:41.213
Going through facebook

04:41.215 --> 04:42.614
Looking at girls' pictures.

04:42.616 --> 04:43.815
I came across her picture.

04:43.817 --> 04:44.616
I'm like, "oh, snap.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.784
This girl's really cute.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.985
Let me just hit her up

04:46.987 --> 04:48.453
And see what happens,

04:48.455 --> 04:49.388
And we hit off

04:49.390 --> 04:50.422
Right then and there.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.724
And then she gave me her number.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.725
She opened up

04:53.727 --> 04:55.494
To me about her personal

04:55.496 --> 04:57.429
Situations with her family.

04:57.431 --> 04:58.196
How hard it was

04:58.198 --> 04:59.264
For her to come out.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.166
She made me understand

05:01.168 --> 05:03.735
It's okay to be gay.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.404
I really do love her,

05:05.406 --> 05:07.205
And she's pretty.

05:07.207 --> 05:07.906
>> so that's part

05:07.908 --> 05:08.774
Of the package to you,

05:08.776 --> 05:09.775
Like, she has to be

05:09.777 --> 05:10.742
Who she looks like?

05:10.744 --> 05:12.644
>> i would hope so.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.112
>> and you said you guys

05:14.114 --> 05:15.714
Have tried to meet up before?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.516
>> yeah. I actually tried

05:17.518 --> 05:19.618
To drive to her.

05:19.620 --> 05:20.619
She made it seem

05:20.621 --> 05:21.520
Like she was still home,

05:21.522 --> 05:22.688
Everything like that.

05:22.690 --> 05:23.722
So, when i drove there, it

05:23.724 --> 05:25.524
Was supposed to be a surprise.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.425
Then when i got there, i was

05:26.427 --> 05:28.026
Like, "hey, i'm in new york.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.294
Where are you at?"

05:29.296 --> 05:30.562
She was just like, "oh,

05:30.564 --> 05:32.864
I'm gone on family vacation."

05:32.866 --> 05:34.833
And then on a couple occasions,

05:34.835 --> 05:36.034
She said that something

05:36.036 --> 05:37.736
Was wrong with her car.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.371
I was nice enough to even

05:39.373 --> 05:40.572
Send her money

05:40.574 --> 05:41.773
To try to get her car

05:41.775 --> 05:42.874
On the road.

05:42.876 --> 05:45.177
>> oh, no.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.745
So why do you keep texting her

05:46.747 --> 05:47.646
If you know that she's giving

05:47.648 --> 05:48.847
You, like, the spin-around?

05:48.849 --> 05:50.015
>> 'cause i want to see her.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.583
Like, i just feel like it's

05:51.585 --> 05:53.618
Really meant for me to meet her,

05:53.620 --> 05:55.420
Because she's made

05:55.422 --> 05:57.122
Me understand i don't have

05:57.124 --> 05:58.523
To be scared because my parents

05:58.525 --> 05:59.725
Are gonna disown me,

05:59.727 --> 06:00.959
But i'm just starting

06:00.961 --> 06:02.194
To get frustrated.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.695
I feel like i'm wasting my time.

06:03.697 --> 06:06.198
>> i mean, your whole identity

06:06.200 --> 06:07.132
Is sort of wrapped up

06:07.134 --> 06:08.900
In this girl who may or may not

06:08.902 --> 06:10.068
Be who she says she is,

06:10.070 --> 06:11.870
And you need to figure this out.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.605
So we want to help.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.040

That.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.675
>> if you're close by,

06:16.677 --> 06:17.709
We can just head over there,

06:17.711 --> 06:18.510

06:18.512 --> 06:19.678
A lot more about this.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.113
And look, if nothing else,

06:21.115 --> 06:23.048
This is just an important moment

06:23.050 --> 06:24.116
In your life.

Thanks for sharing with us.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.197
But not comfortable saying it.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.165
I think that's why she'll keep,

06:40.167 --> 06:41.466
Like, making little excuses,

06:41.468 --> 06:42.934
Like, "i'm gay for a day."

06:42.936 --> 06:44.035
>> it's pretty interesting.

06:44.037 --> 06:44.870

06:44.872 --> 06:46.104
Like, strapped up for the ride

06:46.106 --> 06:47.305

On national television

07:48.802 --> 07:50.569
And express my feeling

07:50.571 --> 07:52.070
Towards a girl.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.738
I'm a haitian, and to my

07:53.740 --> 07:56.608
Culture, they look at it as you

07:56.610 --> 07:58.143
Disrespecting your family.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.478
>> have you ever said anything

07:59.480 --> 08:00.846
To her, like, "hey,

08:00.848 --> 08:02.314
If you're not being straight

08:02.316 --> 08:02.981
With me,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.283
Like, please tell me what's up?"

08:05.285 --> 08:06.051
>> i said it to her

08:06.053 --> 08:07.052
Not too long ago.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.753
I was like, "look, i'm really

08:08.755 --> 08:10.522
Thinking about doing something

08:10.524 --> 08:11.890
That could affect my whole life

08:11.892 --> 08:13.024
When it comes down to you,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.159
So please tell me

08:14.161 --> 08:15.260
What it really is."

08:15.262 --> 08:16.928
She was just basically like,

08:16.930 --> 08:17.596
"oh, babe,

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
I would never do that to you."

08:19.500 --> 08:20.999
>> but there's some pretty

08:21.001 --> 08:23.401
Big sort of red flags.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.471
The first one is sending money.

08:26.473 --> 08:27.439
>> i sent it to her

08:27.441 --> 08:29.207
Through western union.

08:29.209 --> 08:31.376
She sent me a brooklyn address,

08:31.378 --> 08:32.611
And then when she sent me

08:32.613 --> 08:34.946
The address she sent me a name,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.748
But it wasn't emily.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.149
She said it was her cousin.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.083
>> did you get a confirmation

08:39.086 --> 08:40.217
That she picked up the money?

08:40.220 --> 08:40.919
>> i don't think

08:40.921 --> 08:42.687
I have any of that.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.455
>> wow.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.589
>> and then over the course of

08:44.591 --> 08:46.191
The nine months, she's text me

08:46.193 --> 08:48.026
From five different numbers.

08:48.028 --> 08:48.760
>> wow.

08:48.762 --> 08:49.594
>> five?

08:49.596 --> 08:50.896
>> her most recent number

08:50.898 --> 08:51.997
Is this number.

08:51.999 --> 08:52.764
As you can see,

08:52.766 --> 08:54.766
It's a 267 number.

08:54.768 --> 08:55.834
>> is that an area code

08:55.836 --> 08:56.801
For here?

08:56.803 --> 08:57.469
>> yeah.

08:57.471 --> 08:58.470
>> which is weird, right?

08:58.472 --> 08:59.137
>> right.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.105
'cause you're in new york.

09:00.107 --> 09:01.506
A new york area code

09:01.508 --> 09:03.074
Is 917, 347--

09:03.076 --> 09:03.909
>> 646.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.043
>> yeah.

09:05.045 --> 09:05.844
>> well, i'm so curious.

09:05.846 --> 09:06.678
What photos do you have?

09:06.680 --> 09:07.379
How many pictures

09:07.381 --> 09:08.280
Has she sent you?

09:08.282 --> 09:09.347
>> three.

09:09.349 --> 09:10.015
>> wait.

09:10.017 --> 09:11.216
The whole time you guys have

09:11.218 --> 09:12.183
Been talking, she's only

09:12.185 --> 09:13.084
Text-messaged you three

09:13.086 --> 09:13.752
Pictures?

09:13.754 --> 09:14.419
>> mm-hmm.

09:14.421 --> 09:15.253
>> i don't like that.

09:15.255 --> 09:16.655
>> i seen a couple more from

09:16.657 --> 09:17.489
Her facebook page,

09:17.491 --> 09:18.823
But she deactivated her facebook

09:18.825 --> 09:19.491
Page.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.158
>> wow.

09:20.160 --> 09:21.026
>> do you have the pictures?

09:21.028 --> 09:21.860
'cause me and nev

09:21.862 --> 09:22.794
Haven't seen the pictures.

09:22.796 --> 09:23.528
>> mm-hmm.

09:23.530 --> 09:27.098
>> let's see.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.700
Oh, she's got some tats.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.367
>> yeah.

09:29.369 --> 09:30.368
>> both: Okay.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.102
>> really cute.

09:31.104 --> 09:32.637
>> yes.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.305
>> we weren't sure

09:33.307 --> 09:34.072
If she was gonna be,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.173
Like, a victoria's secret model

09:35.175 --> 09:35.840
Or something.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.075
>> no, she's regular cute.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.577
>> it's so interesting,

09:38.579 --> 09:40.745
'cause you seem extremely smart,

09:40.747 --> 09:41.713
But for some reason,

09:41.715 --> 09:42.747
Like, emily has this,

09:42.749 --> 09:45.317
Like, spot in your life that,

09:45.319 --> 09:46.818
Like, all of those things go--

09:46.820 --> 09:47.485
Like, wisp away.

09:47.487 --> 09:48.153
>> yeah.

09:48.155 --> 09:49.054
>> you don't seem like the kind

09:49.056 --> 09:50.288
Of person who puts up

09:50.290 --> 09:51.222
With people's bull[bleep].

09:51.224 --> 09:52.657
>> no. That's

09:52.659 --> 09:53.491
Why i'm getting irked,

09:53.493 --> 09:55.093
But i still want to know

09:55.095 --> 09:56.428
Who i've been talking to,

09:56.430 --> 09:57.529
Because that person

09:57.531 --> 09:58.597
Has made it easier

09:58.599 --> 10:00.799
For me to find a side of myself

10:00.801 --> 10:02.233
That i never wanted to share

10:02.235 --> 10:03.234
With nobody else.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.236
I'm putting so much on the line

10:05.238 --> 10:06.805
To show to somebody that i've

10:06.807 --> 10:08.406
Been talking to for so long

10:08.408 --> 10:10.008
That i really do love you,

10:10.010 --> 10:11.610
'cause if i didn't, obviously,

10:11.612 --> 10:12.644
I wouldn't be putting myself

10:12.646 --> 10:13.612
Through all this.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.279
>> all right,

10:14.281 --> 10:15.313
So give us the night

10:15.315 --> 10:16.715
To kind of do some research.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.882
Tomorrow we'll check back

10:17.884 --> 10:19.284
In with you, let we know

10:19.286 --> 10:20.385
What you find out.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.487
>> the emily mystery begins.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.655
>> yeah. All right. Well,

10:23.657 --> 10:24.489
Let's get out of here, then.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.123
>> thank you, guys.

10:25.125 --> 10:25.724
>> all right,

10:25.726 --> 10:26.458
We'll see you later.

10:26.460 --> 10:29.594
>> bye.

10:29.596 --> 10:31.096
>> whew. What a story.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.130
>> yeah, dude.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.098
>> with a different name

10:33.100 --> 10:34.065
On the money order...

10:34.067 --> 10:35.000
>> it's really odd.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.234
>> yeah.

10:36.236 --> 10:38.770
If emily is in philly...

10:38.772 --> 10:39.704
>> mm-hmm.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.006
>> then who the hell

10:41.008 --> 10:42.407
Is she sending that money to?

10:42.409 --> 10:43.475
>> right. I feel like she's

10:43.477 --> 10:45.210
In that house right there.

10:45.212 --> 10:45.877
>> i mean, she really

10:45.879 --> 10:47.278
Could be, like, anywhere.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.213
Her not being the girl

10:48.215 --> 10:48.947
In the pictures would be

10:48.949 --> 10:49.614
The least of the lies

10:49.616 --> 10:51.683
At this point.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.154
>> all right.

10:56.156 --> 11:01.092
Investigation time.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.360
Hello. Can i come in, please?

11:02.362 --> 11:03.294
>> okay.

11:03.296 --> 11:04.929
>> all right, thanks.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.965
[laughs]

11:06.967 --> 11:09.234
>> all right, so let's just go

11:09.236 --> 11:10.301
Over everything.

11:10.303 --> 11:10.969
>> yeah.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.370
>> hundra sees this cute girl

11:12.372 --> 11:14.472
On facebook, reaches out.

11:14.474 --> 11:15.407
They're into each other,

11:15.409 --> 11:16.441
Obviously.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.375
Emily says, "my car

11:17.377 --> 11:18.276
Has broke down."

11:18.278 --> 11:19.444
So hundra's like, "no problem.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.211
I'll send you some money

11:20.213 --> 11:20.779
To fix it."

11:20.781 --> 11:21.546
Doesn't fix it,

11:21.548 --> 11:22.280
And then hundra

11:22.282 --> 11:23.281
Started to get fed up.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.349
>> hundra said that she

11:24.351 --> 11:25.750
Gave her the ultimatum

11:25.752 --> 11:26.418
That she was gonna

11:26.420 --> 11:27.419
Go on the show.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.286
"are you going to really

11:28.288 --> 11:29.154
Let me do this?"

11:29.156 --> 11:29.821
>> right.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.222
She'd lived her whole life

11:31.224 --> 11:34.359
Afraid to discuss her feelings

11:34.361 --> 11:35.427
Towards women.

11:35.429 --> 11:36.094
Well, let's see

11:36.096 --> 11:36.995
What we can figure out

11:36.997 --> 11:39.831
About this emily girl.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.332
We have an email from hundra.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.400
"i have attached the pictures

11:42.402 --> 11:43.134
I have of her.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.436
Here are the phone numbers

11:44.438 --> 11:45.837
That i still have on my phone.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.605
The cousin who i sent money to--

11:47.607 --> 11:48.907
I do not remember the address.

11:48.909 --> 11:49.574
It was in brooklyn,

11:49.576 --> 11:51.042
But i can't find it."

11:51.044 --> 11:52.877
So let's just try and see

11:52.879 --> 11:54.045
If anything comes up when we

11:54.047 --> 11:57.515
Search her current phone number.

11:57.517 --> 11:58.650
Oh, boy.

11:58.652 --> 11:59.384
>> yes, nice.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.652
>> we got a match.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.253
Geralyn...

12:02.255 --> 12:02.954
Philadelphia.

12:02.956 --> 12:06.224
Well, we should search geralyn.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.359
Geralyn, 21. Lesbian.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.594
>> yeah. Oh, dude!

12:09.596 --> 12:10.261
Dude.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.596
>> this is her facebook page.

12:11.598 --> 12:12.731
Hold on.

12:12.733 --> 12:13.398
>> ha!

12:13.400 --> 12:14.065
>> wait.

12:14.067 --> 12:18.737
Let's go through these pictures.

12:18.739 --> 12:19.404
I mean,

12:19.406 --> 12:21.039
She's more of a boyish look...

12:21.041 --> 12:21.706
>> right, right.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.507
>> as the girl in the pictures

12:22.509 --> 12:23.074
That she sent.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.542
Oh, wait a second.

12:24.544 --> 12:25.543
This is where it

12:25.545 --> 12:26.644
Might get complicated,

12:26.646 --> 12:27.746
Because it looks like she

12:27.748 --> 12:29.047
Might have a girlfriend.

12:29.049 --> 12:31.282
>> a girlfriend.

12:31.284 --> 12:31.950
>> okay, so here

12:31.952 --> 12:33.485
She is making out with a girl

12:33.487 --> 12:35.687
From seven or eight months ago.

12:35.689 --> 12:37.055
Who is she with?

12:37.057 --> 12:38.590
>> dude, dude, dude.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.257
That's the one

12:39.259 --> 12:40.325
From the pictures earlier.

12:40.327 --> 12:40.992
>> which pictures?

12:40.994 --> 12:41.659
>> hundra's.

12:41.661 --> 12:42.327
Doesn't that look

12:42.329 --> 12:43.695
Like emily to you?

12:43.697 --> 12:44.362
>> oh, that looks

12:44.364 --> 12:45.797
Like it could be the girl.

12:45.799 --> 12:46.464
Here we go.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.232
Look, look.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.267
She does have a bunch of tats.

12:49.269 --> 12:49.934
>> that is her, dude.

12:49.936 --> 12:50.602
>> it is her.

12:50.604 --> 12:51.269
>> that's her.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.270
>> so hold on a second.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.037
So figured out who the girl

12:53.039 --> 12:54.272
In the pictures are.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.673
It's a girl named melanie.

12:55.675 --> 12:56.875
She's a lesbian.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.642
She lives in philadelphia,

12:57.644 --> 12:58.443
But she seems to be

12:58.445 --> 12:59.677
In a very serious relationship

12:59.679 --> 13:00.779
With geralyn.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.847
It's looking more likely that

13:02.849 --> 13:04.682
Hundra's talking to geralyn.

13:04.684 --> 13:07.385
>> why would geralyn pimp photos

13:07.387 --> 13:08.353
Of her girl out?

13:08.355 --> 13:09.420
Is melanie

13:09.422 --> 13:11.055
In on the whole thing?

13:11.057 --> 13:11.723
>> maybe.

13:11.725 --> 13:12.457
>> are they running a scam

13:12.459 --> 13:13.491
On multiple people?

13:13.493 --> 13:14.926
Maybe this is all a game.

13:14.928 --> 13:15.693
>> there's still a lot

13:15.695 --> 13:16.294
Of questions,

13:16.296 --> 13:17.228
But i feel like we're starting

13:17.230 --> 13:18.763
To get a little bit closer

13:18.765 --> 13:19.798
To figuring this out.

13:19.800 --> 13:20.465
We got to go

13:20.467 --> 13:21.432
Over all this with her.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.100
>> yeah.

13:22.102 --> 13:22.767
>> all right, cool.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.836
Let's get this going.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.474
There's definitely a new part

13:29.476 --> 13:30.141
Of the story now,

13:30.143 --> 13:31.709
Which is geralyn.

13:31.711 --> 13:32.510
>> yeah.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.444
>> she's definitely involved

13:33.446 --> 13:34.112
Somehow,

13:34.114 --> 13:36.114
But the fact that melanie,

13:36.116 --> 13:36.848
The girl in the pictures,

13:36.850 --> 13:38.449
Is actually also very likely

13:38.451 --> 13:39.484
Involved--

13:39.486 --> 13:41.186
I'm just not sure what hundra's

13:41.188 --> 13:44.255
Gonna make of all this.

13:44.257 --> 13:44.923
Hi.

13:44.925 --> 13:45.623
>> hi, how are you?

13:45.625 --> 13:46.291
>> what's up?

13:46.293 --> 13:46.958

13:51.231 --> 13:51.896
About all this?

13:51.898 --> 13:52.664
>> i'm feeling okay.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.499
I'm just a little nervous.

13:54.501 --> 13:55.433
>> i think we found

13:55.435 --> 13:57.836
Some interesting clues.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.604
We are curious to see

13:59.606 --> 14:01.406
If you can help us add it up.

14:01.408 --> 14:02.073
>> right.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.975
>> okay, so we started

14:03.977 --> 14:05.476
Searching the phone numbers.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.511
The number you have for her now,

14:06.513 --> 14:07.178
Her current number...

14:07.180 --> 14:07.846
>> yeah.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.147
>> that comes up registered

14:09.149 --> 14:11.449
To someone named geralyn.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.250
Have you ever heard that name

14:12.252 --> 14:13.017
Before?

14:13.019 --> 14:13.852
>> no.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.153
>> that doesn't ring any bells?

14:15.155 --> 14:15.954
>> no.

14:15.956 --> 14:16.821
>> so we did a search

14:16.823 --> 14:17.822
For geralyn,

14:17.824 --> 14:19.023
And the first thing that comes

14:19.025 --> 14:20.058
Up is a facebook page.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.726
So we went to her photos,

14:21.728 --> 14:22.527
And we were just sort of--

14:22.529 --> 14:24.095
Started going through.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.465
>> does she look familiar?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.133
>> that looks like emily,

14:29.135 --> 14:30.635
For sure,

14:30.637 --> 14:33.004
And it looks like they're

14:33.006 --> 14:34.505
In a relationship, obviously.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.208
They're kissing and touching.

14:40.847 --> 14:42.947
Have you heard that name before?

14:42.949 --> 14:44.148
>> both: No.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.850
>> and melanie lives in philly.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.819
She's got a lot of photos.

Here are two of the photos

14:50.423 --> 14:54.425
That you got of her.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.361
And if we go down here,

14:56.363 --> 14:57.028
There are a lot

14:57.030 --> 15:00.064
Of pictures of them together.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.332
And she says, "my girlfriend,

18:03.516 --> 18:04.816
Looking into this whole

18:04.818 --> 18:05.983
Situation, and we found

Some interesting things.

You might actually be able to

For a while.

18:32.045 --> 18:32.710
We ended up getting

18:32.712 --> 18:33.411
Into a relationship.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.513
We broke up because i was still

18:35.515 --> 18:36.647
In love with the other girl,

18:36.649 --> 18:37.482
So i got back

>> don't get me wrong,

24:51.190 --> 24:52.923
But you're not emily...

24:52.925 --> 24:53.591
>> i know.

24:53.593 --> 24:56.026
>> or melanie or whoever.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.061
>> i'm not emily.

24:57.063 --> 24:58.529
I'm not a femme.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.631
I'm me.

25:00.633 --> 25:01.465
>> do you have any

25:01.467 --> 25:02.766
Of the same kind of intensity

25:02.768 --> 25:03.901
Or feelings towards hundra

25:03.903 --> 25:07.538
That you felt for melanie?

25:07.540 --> 25:08.606
If there's a moment

25:08.608 --> 25:10.074
To be totally--

25:10.076 --> 25:10.774
>> honest, it's now.

25:10.776 --> 25:11.442
>> level with her

25:11.444 --> 25:12.710
So that she can make

25:12.712 --> 25:13.544
The best decision for her.

25:13.546 --> 25:15.079
Like, you've got to do that now.

25:15.081 --> 25:15.880
>> i got it.

25:15.882 --> 25:16.814
>> both: Yeah.

25:16.816 --> 25:17.581
>> i was just trying

25:17.583 --> 25:19.917
To be spiteful...

25:19.919 --> 25:20.985
But then i actually

25:20.987 --> 25:22.887
Started to like you,

25:22.889 --> 25:23.754
And then i felt

25:23.756 --> 25:24.855
Like i was in too deep,

25:24.857 --> 25:25.956
And i didn't want to lose you at

25:25.958 --> 25:27.691
The same time, but i wanted to--

25:27.693 --> 25:28.993
>> yeah, but you have been open

25:28.995 --> 25:30.728
To me about a lot of things.

25:30.730 --> 25:31.629
>> i've been real with you,

25:31.631 --> 25:33.397
Despite the pictures.

25:33.399 --> 25:35.232
>> well, a lot of it's not true.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.333
I mean...

25:36.335 --> 25:37.301
>> and then i sent you money.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.536
Like, where's my money?

25:38.538 --> 25:39.770
>> i never picked it up.

25:39.772 --> 25:40.437
>> okay, so--

25:40.439 --> 25:41.539
>> i just wanted to see if you

25:41.541 --> 25:43.440
Really was riding for me or not.

25:43.442 --> 25:45.009
>> how you know i rocked out

25:45.011 --> 25:46.577
And really sent you the money?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.913
>> i just took your word for it.

25:48.915 --> 25:49.813
>> like i've been

25:49.815 --> 25:51.081
Taking your word for it.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.050
Okay.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.018
>> from what i'm gathering,

25:54.020 --> 25:56.854
Like, she actually started

25:56.856 --> 25:57.855
Liking you, and i don't think

25:57.857 --> 26:00.190
It's some deep, crazy scheme

26:00.192 --> 26:02.927
Going on.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.128
>> i feel like now it sort of

26:04.130 --> 26:05.796
Needs to, like,

26:05.798 --> 26:06.997
Marinate a little bit.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.032
You do your thing

26:08.034 --> 26:10.200
And then meet up again tomorrow

26:10.202 --> 26:11.569
And, like, see how it

26:11.571 --> 26:13.470
Feels starting a fresh day.

26:13.472 --> 26:14.138
>> okay.

26:14.140 --> 26:14.805
>> good to meet you.

26:14.807 --> 26:18.008
>> thank you.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.476
>> oh, wow.

26:19.478 --> 26:22.546
Oh...

26:26.484 --> 26:27.251
>> i mean, you're being

26:27.253 --> 26:28.686
Pretty harsh on her.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.054
>> i really don't want that...

26:30.056 --> 26:30.721
At all.

26:30.723 --> 26:31.522
>> that's an ignorant way

26:31.524 --> 26:33.490
To look at it.

26:37.195 --> 26:37.861
>> message came in.

26:37.863 --> 26:38.529
>> from?

26:38.531 --> 26:39.196
>> geralyn.

26:39.198 --> 26:40.097
>> oh, really?

26:40.099 --> 26:41.231
>> "hey, nev, can we meet up

26:41.233 --> 26:42.833
Today without hundra?

26:42.835 --> 26:44.001
I need to tell you

26:44.003 --> 26:45.369
A few things."

26:45.371 --> 26:46.537
>> okay.

26:46.539 --> 26:47.805
>> so my feeling was, like,

26:47.807 --> 26:49.907
Hundra's whole weird philosophy

26:49.909 --> 26:51.108
On lesbians trying

26:51.110 --> 26:52.376
To convert--

26:52.378 --> 26:53.711
>> yeah, you're right.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.378
>> i don't know

26:54.380 --> 26:55.112
Where she gets that from.

26:55.114 --> 26:55.913
I don't know that geralyn

26:55.915 --> 26:56.580
Would necessarily want

26:56.582 --> 26:57.481
To be with someone who's like--

26:57.483 --> 26:58.849
That doesn't seem like her vibe.

26:58.851 --> 26:59.516
>> right, right.

26:59.518 --> 27:00.384
>> maybe the move is we head

27:00.386 --> 27:01.719
Over to geralyn's, find out

27:01.721 --> 27:02.720
What she needs to tell us.

27:02.722 --> 27:03.387
>> yeah.

27:03.389 --> 27:05.689
>> all right, then.

27:05.691 --> 27:09.526
Is geralyn really into hundra?

27:09.528 --> 27:10.828
I mean, geralyn was definitely

27:10.830 --> 27:13.197
Crazy in love with melanie.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.565
I don't think she's over that.

27:14.567 --> 27:15.833
>> i wonder if there's, like,

27:15.835 --> 27:17.735
An interesting fact that

27:17.737 --> 27:19.236
Geralyn's about to lay on us,

27:19.238 --> 27:20.004
'cause, i mean, if she

27:20.006 --> 27:21.505
Was not interested in hundra,

27:21.507 --> 27:22.306
Then she could probably

27:22.308 --> 27:24.675
Have just told hundra that.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.343
>> okay.

27:26.345 --> 27:28.379
Let's see what she's got to say.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.613
[knock at door]

27:29.615 --> 27:30.314
Hey.

27:30.316 --> 27:30.981
>> hey, guys.

27:30.983 --> 27:31.815
>> good morning. How you doing?

27:31.817 --> 27:32.383
>> good morning.

27:32.385 --> 27:33.550
>> can we come in with the crew?

27:33.552 --> 27:34.218
>> yeah.

27:34.220 --> 27:35.686
>> all right, let's do it, guys.

27:35.688 --> 27:36.720
Have a seat.

27:36.722 --> 27:38.188
>> [sighs]

27:38.190 --> 27:41.125
>> so did you and hundra talk

27:41.127 --> 27:42.059
At all between--

27:42.061 --> 27:42.726
>> nope.

27:42.728 --> 27:45.729
>> no?

27:45.731 --> 27:47.531
>> listen...

27:47.533 --> 27:48.332
I'm gonna be honest

27:48.334 --> 27:49.266
With you guys.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.201
>> now she's gonna be honest.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.938
All right, what's up?

27:54.940 --> 27:56.807
>> i don't know hundra.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.175
>> you don't know hundra?

27:58.177 --> 27:59.576
>> what do you mean

27:59.578 --> 28:00.644
You don't know hundra?

28:00.646 --> 28:02.212
>> i've only been talking to her

28:02.214 --> 28:03.547
For about, like, four weeks.

28:03.549 --> 28:04.214
>> so you mean

28:04.216 --> 28:05.482
The whole nine-months thing

28:05.484 --> 28:06.483
Isn't actually true?

28:06.485 --> 28:07.217
>> it's not true, no.

28:07.219 --> 28:07.885
>> so you guys only

28:07.887 --> 28:09.053
Started talking four weeks ago?

28:09.055 --> 28:10.754
>> yes.

28:10.756 --> 28:11.422
>> okay.

28:11.424 --> 28:12.656
>> see, but you still

28:12.658 --> 28:15.959
Have been talking to her?

28:15.961 --> 28:19.496
>> okay, um...

28:19.498 --> 28:20.497
Well, obviously,

28:20.499 --> 28:22.299
She contacted the show.

28:22.301 --> 28:22.966
>> right.

28:22.968 --> 28:24.768
>> but it's just, like--

28:24.770 --> 28:26.603
It's not true.

28:26.605 --> 28:28.172
Don't know hundra.

28:28.174 --> 28:33.010
Don't like her at all like that.

28:33.012 --> 28:33.777
>> wait.

28:33.779 --> 28:35.879
Melanie knew hundra?

28:35.881 --> 28:36.647
>> yeah.

28:36.649 --> 28:37.781
>> so melanie knows

28:37.783 --> 28:38.949
That this is all fake too?

28:38.951 --> 28:39.950
Either you guys are, like,

28:39.952 --> 28:41.952
Academy award-winning actors or,

28:41.954 --> 28:42.786
Like--

28:42.788 --> 28:44.088
'cause you guys are--

28:44.090 --> 28:44.755
>> okay, so hold on.

28:44.757 --> 28:45.622
So you and melanie

28:45.624 --> 28:47.758
Are for real ex-girlfriends?

28:47.760 --> 28:48.425
>> yeah.

28:48.427 --> 28:50.294
>> okay.

28:50.296 --> 28:51.295
>> that's true.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.163
>> and a month ago, hundra

28:53.165 --> 28:54.865
Contacted you guys

28:54.867 --> 28:55.799
And said, "hey, i want to get

28:55.801 --> 28:58.068
On this show 'catfish.'"

28:58.070 --> 28:59.336
>> i don't know.

28:59.338 --> 29:00.003
I don't know

29:00.005 --> 29:00.938
If it was like that.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.039
I have no idea.

29:02.041 --> 29:03.273
>> that's bull[bleep].

29:03.275 --> 29:05.109
There's got to be some reason

29:05.111 --> 29:07.144
You're involved in this.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.278
Was it because you thought

29:08.280 --> 29:10.047
You could get on the show?

29:10.049 --> 29:10.748
Why would you

29:10.750 --> 29:11.849
Risk your reputation

29:11.851 --> 29:12.783
Just to help some girl

29:12.785 --> 29:14.017
You don't know?

29:14.019 --> 29:15.085
>> if melanie wanted to help

29:15.087 --> 29:16.587
Her, then...

29:16.589 --> 29:18.021
I love her, so i'm gonna help.

29:18.023 --> 29:20.124
>> so melanie asked you to help

29:20.126 --> 29:21.358
Her and encouraged

29:21.360 --> 29:23.127
You to get involved?

29:23.129 --> 29:24.194
>> well, yeah.

29:24.196 --> 29:24.995
She needs help,

29:24.997 --> 29:26.697
I'm gonna help her, okay?

29:26.699 --> 29:28.132
I'm down. I'm riding.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.266
>> help her what, though?

29:29.268 --> 29:30.734
>> is hundra even lesbian?

29:30.736 --> 29:31.802
Does she even like girls?

29:31.804 --> 29:32.903
>> i have no idea, but the way

29:32.905 --> 29:33.937
She's trying to make me look

29:33.939 --> 29:34.838
Out there was like--

29:34.840 --> 29:35.906
I'm just trying

29:35.908 --> 29:37.274
To turn straight girls out.

29:37.276 --> 29:38.709
No, that's not how--

29:38.711 --> 29:39.810
You don't portray a lesbian

29:39.812 --> 29:40.477
That way.

29:40.479 --> 29:42.746
I don't want to be made to look

29:42.748 --> 29:44.448
On tv like i'm that person.

29:44.450 --> 29:45.282
>> i'm still not sure

29:45.284 --> 29:46.650
I understand the situation.

29:46.652 --> 29:47.584
Why are we here?

29:47.586 --> 29:49.052
>> i could be with my daughter

29:49.054 --> 29:50.788
On father's day right now.

29:50.790 --> 29:51.455
Does hundra know

29:51.457 --> 29:52.256
That we know this right

29:52.258 --> 29:52.923
Now that you told us?

29:52.925 --> 29:53.590
>> nope.

29:53.592 --> 29:54.291
>> so hundra thinks

29:54.293 --> 29:55.025
That we believe her?

29:55.027 --> 29:55.993
>> yeah.

29:55.995 --> 29:56.960
>> piece of [bleep].

29:56.962 --> 29:58.629
I'm pretty [bleep] mad.

29:58.631 --> 29:59.797
There's really no point

29:59.799 --> 30:01.431
In us being here.

30:01.433 --> 30:03.467
I'm [bleep] out, for sure.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.968
[bleep] idiot.

30:04.970 --> 30:05.769
Let's go get hundra.

30:05.771 --> 30:06.904
I'm about to go crazy

30:06.906 --> 30:10.908

30:10.910 --> 30:12.376
>> all right. "hey, ladies,

30:12.378 --> 30:15.012
Would love to chat."

30:15.014 --> 30:15.679
>> it was all, like,

30:15.681 --> 30:17.815
A plot just to get on tv.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.419
>> swear to god,

30:22.421 --> 30:23.554
I'm mad as [bleep].

30:23.556 --> 30:25.255
>> all right.

30:25.257 --> 30:28.091
>> sorry.

Right.

30:51.350 --> 30:52.115
The only person

30:52.117 --> 30:54.618
Who could manipulate geralyn

30:54.620 --> 30:56.019
Into doing this is melanie,

30:56.021 --> 30:56.954
'cause she's got her wrapped

30:56.956 --> 30:57.554
Around her finger.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.310
>> find out why they did it.

31:20.312 --> 31:21.678
>> just like get a straight

31:21.680 --> 31:22.980
Story that makes sense.

31:22.982 --> 31:24.214
>> yeah.

31:24.216 --> 31:27.384
Is this them pulling up?

31:33.591 --> 31:34.925
>> did you come with hundra?

31:34.927 --> 31:35.592
>> no.

31:35.594 --> 31:36.260
>> no.

31:36.262 --> 31:38.562
Oh, here she is.

31:43.768 --> 31:45.002
>> hi.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.303
>> so what's up?

31:46.305 --> 31:47.704
>> really?

31:47.706 --> 31:49.106
So you just steal pictures

31:49.108 --> 31:53.043
And talk to people?

31:53.045 --> 31:54.111
I'm talking to you.

31:54.113 --> 31:55.078
>> i can hear you.

31:55.080 --> 31:55.746
>> so speak.

31:55.748 --> 31:59.149
Like, you think that's cool?

31:59.151 --> 32:00.150
>> it's over, yo.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.919
>> what's over?

32:01.921 --> 32:03.520
What's over?

32:03.522 --> 32:06.390
>> this whole thing is over.

32:06.392 --> 32:07.624
>> what do you mean?

32:07.626 --> 32:09.660
>> she spilled the beans.

32:09.662 --> 32:12.930
Y'all playing us.

32:12.932 --> 32:13.797
Hundra, you want

32:13.799 --> 32:16.667
To tell us something?

32:16.669 --> 32:18.802
You knew them already, huh?

32:25.810 --> 32:27.077
>> so that was it?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.378
You just wanted to come out?

32:28.380 --> 32:29.179
You had to have at least

32:29.181 --> 32:30.047
Had a reason to want

32:30.049 --> 32:33.951
To be on television.

32:33.953 --> 32:34.651
Why does the world

32:34.653 --> 32:35.953
Need to know that you're gay?

32:35.955 --> 32:37.387
>> when you're in a culture

32:37.389 --> 32:38.655
That hates

32:38.657 --> 32:40.657
What you have to become,

32:40.659 --> 32:41.825
It's not that easy.

32:41.827 --> 32:42.859
So, yeah, in a way, the world

32:42.861 --> 32:43.860
Should give a [bleep].

32:43.862 --> 32:44.528
I don't want

32:44.530 --> 32:45.262
To keep hiding myself.

32:45.264 --> 32:46.029
>> but what's the world

32:46.031 --> 32:48.966
Gonna take away from this?

32:48.968 --> 32:49.933
Right now you're setting

32:49.935 --> 32:52.069
A really bad example for people.

32:52.071 --> 32:53.070
>> how?

32:53.072 --> 32:55.639
>> because you lied,

32:55.641 --> 32:58.742
And you also speak on gays...

32:58.744 --> 33:02.145
Like they have a disease.

33:02.147 --> 33:03.547
>> i feel like i can call

33:03.549 --> 33:04.414
Them certain names

33:04.416 --> 33:06.183
Because i've been in their world

33:06.185 --> 33:08.585
For a while.

33:08.587 --> 33:09.686
>> on paper, like,

33:09.688 --> 33:12.923
I think your crusade to liberate

33:12.925 --> 33:14.391
Haitian women across the nation

33:14.393 --> 33:16.126
Is, like, beautiful, and,

33:16.128 --> 33:17.527
Like, there are very real ways

33:17.529 --> 33:18.895
That one could do that.

33:18.897 --> 33:20.297
And this is the worst way

33:20.299 --> 33:20.998
To do it.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.666
This is incredibly selfish.

33:22.668 --> 33:23.500
>> 'cause you don't look

33:23.502 --> 33:26.036
Like a hero.

33:26.038 --> 33:27.637
>> okay, well, this is done.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.472
>> yeah.

33:28.474 --> 33:32.576
Thank you.

33:32.578 --> 33:34.044
So why are you smiling?

33:34.046 --> 33:34.711
What's funny?

33:34.713 --> 33:35.746
>> it's not funny.

33:35.748 --> 33:36.980
It's just [bleep] up.

33:36.982 --> 33:37.647
It is.

33:37.649 --> 33:38.415
>> and why did you go along

33:38.417 --> 33:39.016
With this?

33:39.018 --> 33:40.150
What do you have invested

33:40.152 --> 33:40.817
In her?

33:40.819 --> 33:41.485
>> sucker.

33:41.487 --> 33:42.652
You are a sucker.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.820
You.

33:43.822 --> 33:44.755
Corny.

33:44.757 --> 33:45.422
You are corny.

33:45.424 --> 33:46.623
>> so a random girl just hits

33:46.625 --> 33:47.457
You up on the internet and says,

33:47.459 --> 33:48.325
Like, "hey, will you help me

33:48.327 --> 33:49.760
Lie on national television?"

33:49.762 --> 33:50.460
You're like, "sure."

33:50.462 --> 33:51.328
>> well, it wasn't like that.

33:51.330 --> 33:51.895
I mean,

33:51.897 --> 33:52.796
She wasn't a random girl.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.197
I mean, we were friends.

33:54.199 --> 33:54.898
>> i just don't see

33:54.900 --> 33:56.166
You and hundra being friends.

33:56.168 --> 33:56.967
I don't get that pairing.

33:56.969 --> 33:57.701
>> no, but we are, though.

33:57.703 --> 33:58.668
I mean, i wouldn't say we're,

33:58.670 --> 34:00.037
Like, the best of friends.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.038
I'm like, "oh..."

34:01.040 --> 34:05.208
Now we're not friends.

34:05.210 --> 34:06.309
I regret all of it.

34:06.311 --> 34:07.110
You're corny.

34:07.112 --> 34:07.778
You're not a hero.

34:07.780 --> 34:11.014
You are a shameful citizen.

34:11.016 --> 34:13.617
Like...

34:13.619 --> 34:14.384
And she runs away

34:14.386 --> 34:15.052
From her problems.

34:15.054 --> 34:15.752
Are you kidding me?

34:15.754 --> 34:16.585
You know what the [bleep]

34:16.588 --> 34:17.587
I had to do to get here?

34:17.589 --> 34:18.822
What a coward, dude.

34:18.824 --> 34:21.792
You're a coward, man.

34:21.793 --> 34:22.659
>> why wouldn't you say,

34:22.661 --> 34:24.027
Like, "hey, hundra,

34:24.029 --> 34:25.362
We want to help you,

34:25.364 --> 34:26.496
But i'm not about to make

34:26.498 --> 34:28.231
My [bleep] ex-girlfriend look

34:28.233 --> 34:29.199
Like an ass[bleep]."

34:29.201 --> 34:30.833
When we came up here yesterday,

34:30.835 --> 34:32.469
She made it sound like geralyn

34:32.471 --> 34:33.536
Was just trying to, like,

34:33.539 --> 34:34.737
Put a notch on her belt and,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.172
Like, convert a straight girl.

34:36.175 --> 34:37.306
>> oh, my god.

34:37.309 --> 34:38.375
>> is she blackmailing you?

34:38.377 --> 34:39.476
Like, what--

34:39.478 --> 34:40.310
Why would you go through

34:40.312 --> 34:41.878
With this?

34:41.880 --> 34:44.748
>> i don't know.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.384
>> you did it for her.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.018
>> yeah, pretty much.

34:49.021 --> 34:49.886
>> well, the lesson here,

34:49.888 --> 34:51.922
Obviously, is if you're gonna

34:51.924 --> 34:53.422
Get involved in something,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.190
You got to, like,

34:54.193 --> 34:55.492
Think about what that means.

34:55.494 --> 34:56.159
>> yeah.

34:56.161 --> 34:56.827
>> right.

34:56.829 --> 34:57.594
>> i mean, for both of you--

34:57.596 --> 34:58.161
Like, you know,

34:58.163 --> 34:59.129
You guys put yourselves

34:59.131 --> 35:00.330
In a [bleep] situation and,

35:00.332 --> 35:01.598
Like, risked your reputation.

35:01.600 --> 35:02.399
>> for the whole world to see.

35:02.401 --> 35:03.266
>> yeah.

35:03.268 --> 35:03.934
>> wow.

35:03.936 --> 35:05.769
>> yeah.

35:05.771 --> 35:06.803
>> it sucks.

35:06.805 --> 35:08.205
I just want to apologize.

35:08.207 --> 35:09.239
I'm sorry.

35:09.241 --> 35:09.906
>> all right.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.609
Well, good luck with everything.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.116
>> hundra, man...

35:19.118 --> 35:20.450
The mastermind.

35:20.452 --> 35:22.519
Who would have [bleep] thunk?

35:22.521 --> 35:23.386
>> never did i think--

35:23.388 --> 35:24.121
>> this is the conclusion.

35:24.123 --> 35:24.855
>> i don't even know

35:24.857 --> 35:26.790
What to think.

35:30.862 --> 35:31.795
>> this episode of

35:31.797 --> 35:33.130
Catfish: The tv show"

35:33.132 --> 35:37.234
Continues now.

35:37.236 --> 35:39.136
Well, i'm back in my hotel

35:39.138 --> 35:40.403
Room...

35:40.405 --> 35:43.807
Trying to sort of just, like...

35:43.809 --> 35:45.642
Process everything

35:45.644 --> 35:46.643
That's been going--

35:46.645 --> 35:47.878
[laughs]

35:47.880 --> 35:49.312
Everything that went down.

35:49.314 --> 35:50.514
It's definitely upsetting.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.817
I don't like...

35:53.819 --> 35:56.019
Being made

35:56.021 --> 35:58.488
To look like a fool.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.723
[sighs]

35:59.725 --> 36:00.390
I just don't know

36:00.392 --> 36:01.158
What's up with hundra.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.726
I can't figure it out.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.594
Well, speak of the devil.

36:04.596 --> 36:05.929
I just got a text message

36:05.931 --> 36:07.564
From hundra, saying

36:07.566 --> 36:10.333
That she's at my hotel.

36:10.335 --> 36:13.069
"can i talk to you, only you?"

36:13.071 --> 36:14.070
Okay.

36:14.072 --> 36:14.871
Be curious to see

36:14.873 --> 36:15.772
What she has to say.

36:15.774 --> 36:19.176
Let's go talk to hundra.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.844
Hey.

36:20.846 --> 36:23.113
How you doing?

36:23.115 --> 36:27.551
You want to talk about it?

36:27.553 --> 36:29.519
So i was hoping

36:29.521 --> 36:30.720
We'd get a chance to talk,

36:30.722 --> 36:32.422
'cause, obviously, things got

36:32.424 --> 36:34.524
A little crazy at the end there.

36:34.526 --> 36:35.659
>> well, me personally,

36:35.661 --> 36:36.326
I'm not gonna

36:36.328 --> 36:37.794
Apologize for anything.

36:37.796 --> 36:38.528
I'm really not,

36:38.530 --> 36:39.196
Because regardless

36:39.198 --> 36:40.964
How you felt about how i did it,

36:40.966 --> 36:42.332
I wanted my coming out to be

36:42.334 --> 36:43.333
Something "rememorable" for me.

36:43.335 --> 36:44.000
>> i don't think

36:44.002 --> 36:46.102
This is going to get you further

36:46.104 --> 36:47.137
With the friends and family

36:47.139 --> 36:47.804
That you care about.

36:47.806 --> 36:48.471
They're now going

36:48.473 --> 36:50.106
To be so surprised that this

36:50.108 --> 36:51.174
Happened that they're not even

36:51.176 --> 36:51.942
Going to focus on the fact

36:51.944 --> 36:52.609
That you're gay.

36:52.611 --> 36:53.343
It's going to just be

36:53.345 --> 36:54.177
Like, "well, why'd you lie?

36:54.179 --> 36:55.011
Why'd you have to go on tv?"

36:55.013 --> 36:56.580
>> not necessarily.

36:56.582 --> 36:57.714
>> but isn't this gonna

36:57.716 --> 36:59.482
Be worse?

36:59.484 --> 37:00.517
>> for my mom?

37:00.519 --> 37:01.184
>> yeah.

37:01.186 --> 37:02.652
Now friends and family--they're

37:02.654 --> 37:04.254
All gonna hear about this.

37:04.256 --> 37:05.155
If you wanted people to know

37:05.157 --> 37:05.989
You were gay, there were, like,

37:05.991 --> 37:07.090
A lot of little things you

37:07.092 --> 37:09.192
Could have tried before this.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.493
That's all.

37:10.495 --> 37:11.761
>> there was, but--

37:11.763 --> 37:13.096
>> i think your intentions,

37:13.098 --> 37:14.831
In terms of creating an episode

37:14.833 --> 37:15.498
Of a show

37:15.500 --> 37:17.000
That addresses homosexuality--

37:17.002 --> 37:18.668
Like, that is incredibly

37:18.670 --> 37:20.003
Important.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.671
>> ♪ will we make it? ♪

37:21.673 --> 37:22.572

37:23.675 --> 37:24.708
By this [bleep]-up craziness

37:24.710 --> 37:25.475
Of all this.

But everybody's different.

37:29.681 --> 37:30.981

38:14.326 --> 38:15.158
To geralyn.

38:15.160 --> 38:15.825
>> right, right.

38:15.827 --> 38:16.493
>> and i think melanie

38:16.495 --> 38:17.394
Might actually be there.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.194
>> oh, sick. All right, cool.

38:18.196 --> 38:18.895
>> all right, you ready?

38:18.897 --> 38:20.263
I'll add geralyn.

38:20.265 --> 38:21.398
Hey-o.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.065
>> hey.

38:22.067 --> 38:22.832
>> hey.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.000
What's been the aftermath

38:24.002 --> 38:26.903
With this whole crazy situation?

38:35.880 --> 38:36.579
>> i think that thing

38:36.581 --> 38:37.580
With her was just so weird,

38:37.582 --> 38:38.248
'cause it was

38:38.250 --> 38:39.082
Like it didn't really seem

38:39.084 --> 38:39.783
That there was anything

38:39.785 --> 38:42.085
In it for you guys.

38:52.430 --> 38:53.229
>> why do you think she

38:53.231 --> 38:55.565
Would go through with all this?

38:55.567 --> 38:56.700
All right, so, aside

38:56.702 --> 38:57.500
From all of that,

38:57.502 --> 38:58.234
I see that you guys

38:58.236 --> 38:58.902
Are hanging out,

38:58.904 --> 39:00.937
But, like, has any--

39:00.939 --> 39:02.372
Oh, okay. Oh.

39:02.374 --> 39:03.707
[girls laugh]

39:03.709 --> 39:04.574
I'm glad that you're still

39:04.576 --> 39:05.709
Friends and that you made it

39:05.711 --> 39:07.043
Through this weird thing

39:07.045 --> 39:07.711
Together.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.645
>> again, i'm sorry.

39:08.647 --> 39:09.346
>> yeah, i'm sorry.

39:09.348 --> 39:10.213
>> i am so sorry, you guys.

39:10.215 --> 39:11.381
>> all right, ladies,

39:11.383 --> 39:12.449
You guys be good, okay?

39:12.451 --> 39:13.516
We'll speak to you soon.

39:13.518 --> 39:14.184
>> all right.

39:14.186 --> 39:14.884
>> bye.

39:14.886 --> 39:15.985
>> bye.

39:15.987 --> 39:17.687
[line trilling]

39:17.689 --> 39:18.655
>> hey, hundra.

39:18.657 --> 39:19.322
How you doing?

39:19.324 --> 39:20.290
>> i'm fine.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.124
>> have you now

39:21.126 --> 39:22.425
Told your friends and family

39:22.427 --> 39:23.560
That you're exploring

39:23.562 --> 39:25.195
Your sexuality?

39:25.197 --> 39:26.696
>> i've been talking to girls,

39:26.698 --> 39:28.365
And my friends have been out on

39:28.367 --> 39:29.966
Dates with me and other girls,

39:29.968 --> 39:31.768
So i'm just testing it out,

39:31.770 --> 39:34.137
Because, you know, i came out.

39:34.139 --> 39:34.804
>> how do you feel

39:34.806 --> 39:37.173
About how you chose to come out?

39:37.175 --> 39:37.974
>> i'm not happy

39:37.976 --> 39:39.943
About how i went about with it,

39:39.945 --> 39:40.977
'cause people that know me--

39:40.979 --> 39:42.178
They're gonna know that,

39:42.180 --> 39:43.179
"hundra's not that type of

39:43.181 --> 39:43.847
Person.

39:43.849 --> 39:45.181
Like, why would she go that far

39:45.183 --> 39:46.383
Just to get, whatever,

39:46.385 --> 39:47.050
Attention?"

39:47.052 --> 39:48.184
>> well, and you wasted our

39:48.186 --> 39:48.952
Time.

39:48.954 --> 39:50.320
>> i mean, i wasn't necessarily

39:50.322 --> 39:51.154
Wasting time,

39:51.156 --> 39:52.655
Because everybody still

39:52.657 --> 39:54.290
Got something out of it.

39:54.292 --> 39:55.925
You're still a rapper that's

39:55.927 --> 39:57.560
About to be on a television show

39:57.562 --> 39:59.129
Because of whatever i came up

39:59.131 --> 39:59.796
With.

39:59.798 --> 40:01.297
>> oh, don't even--

40:01.299 --> 40:03.500
>> if you want an apology

40:03.502 --> 40:04.768
For wasting your time--

40:04.770 --> 40:06.436
I don't feel bad, because i feel

40:06.438 --> 40:08.071
As though i'm a person

40:08.073 --> 40:09.672
That got you to my attention.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.740
>> but the way you did it

40:10.742 --> 40:12.342
By lying and disrespecting

40:12.344 --> 40:13.476
Your community--

40:13.478 --> 40:14.878
I just feel like this would have

40:14.880 --> 40:16.012
Been the perfect opportunity

40:16.014 --> 40:17.881
To learn from it and be like,

40:17.883 --> 40:18.548
"oh, [bleep].

40:18.550 --> 40:20.183
I don't want to be like this."

40:20.185 --> 40:21.184
>> i'm not gonna go

40:21.186 --> 40:22.285
And reverse my words

40:22.287 --> 40:24.320
And say, "i regret how i went

40:24.322 --> 40:25.355
About it with myself,"

40:25.357 --> 40:26.189
'cause there's nothing

40:26.191 --> 40:27.157
That i can take back.

40:27.159 --> 40:27.924
>> okay.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.659
>> it's just that.

40:29.661 --> 40:30.827
>> i guess that's it.

40:30.829 --> 40:31.661
I guess, you know--

40:31.663 --> 40:32.429
>> okay.

40:32.431 --> 40:33.730
>> bye for now.

40:33.732 --> 40:34.531
>> later.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.498
>> okay.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.200
She hasn't changed much.

40:37.202 --> 40:37.867
>> no comment.

40:37.869 --> 40:38.535
[both laugh]

40:38.537 --> 40:39.302
>> all right, later, kells.

40:39.304 --> 40:39.869
>> later, guys.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.938
>> peace.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.608
>> "she could be the one for me.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.342
I've even asked her

40:46.344 --> 40:47.844
To come live with me."

40:47.846 --> 40:49.045
>> i went to her house.

40:49.047 --> 40:49.913
Her uncle answered,

40:49.915 --> 40:51.147
And he told me no one

40:51.149 --> 40:52.615
By that name lived there.

40:52.617 --> 40:53.683
>> "18-year-old takes police

40:53.685 --> 40:55.652
On stolen-vehicle chase."

40:55.654 --> 40:56.419
She could have a little bit

40:56.421 --> 40:57.854
Of a record.

40:57.856 --> 40:58.955
If i were in your shoes,

40:58.957 --> 41:00.423
I would be freaking out.

41:00.425 --> 41:01.157
>> somebody's looking.

41:01.159 --> 41:03.159
>> what the hell is going on?
