Your name is Annie Walker,

04:44.968 --> 04:47.320
sent here to murder your former
colleague Lena Smith.

05:00.048 --> 05:02.248
Chip.

05:02.250 --> 05:06.352
Your last contact,
somebody called Mingus.

05:06.354 --> 05:08.688
The same area code you used
to contact Lena.

05:08.690 --> 05:10.656
It's a front for Langley.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.593
You were calling

Who is Mingus?

05:22.904 --> 05:27.542
Wrong again.

05:27.544 --> 05:30.611
This is your "Mingus".

05:30.613 --> 05:33.581
Lena was a tremendous font

05:33.583 --> 05:36.851
especially about you.

If you know all the answers,

Thank you.

So...

05:58.107 --> 06:00.741
How you holding up?

06:00.743 --> 06:03.244
I've been better.

06:03.246 --> 06:05.279
Listen, that--
that offer still stands

06:05.281 --> 06:06.914
if, um, you're interested.

06:06.916 --> 06:09.884
There's Arthur.

06:12.253 --> 06:13.387
None of us look forward

06:13.389 --> 06:15.556
to this kind

06:15.558 --> 06:17.758
and having to discuss
worst-case scenarios.

06:17.760 --> 06:20.328
It's been four days
since we lost contact

06:20.330 --> 06:21.629
with operative Walker,

06:21.631 --> 06:23.097
and it's time to address
the potential fallout

06:23.099 --> 06:24.232
if she's been captured.

06:24.234 --> 06:25.500
That's the worst-case
scenario?

06:25.502 --> 06:27.502
For the purposes
of this exercise, yes.

06:27.504 --> 06:29.504
Her being captured
is as bad as it gets.

06:29.506 --> 06:30.672
If she can't hold up

06:30.674 --> 06:32.241
under the pressure
of interrogation--

06:32.243 --> 06:34.276
- She'll hold up.
- But if she can't,

06:34.278 --> 06:36.479
and she tells the F.S.B.
everything she knows,

06:36.481 --> 06:38.180
we need to know what kind
of damage that can do

06:38.182 --> 06:40.116
to the Agency's operations.

06:40.118 --> 06:42.252
Annie is not going
to talk.

06:42.254 --> 06:44.788
She's already demonstrated
her commitment

06:44.790 --> 06:47.157
to this Agency
by eliminating someone

06:47.159 --> 06:49.193
who could've done
a hell of a lot more damage

06:49.195 --> 06:50.494
to our operations.

06:50.496 --> 06:51.828
Joan, no one is questioning
Annie's courage

06:51.830 --> 06:52.929
or her commitment.

06:52.931 --> 06:54.998
We're conducting a risks

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
and vulnerabilities inventory
for operative Walker, Joan,

06:57.002 --> 07:00.003
same as we do
for every captured operative.

07:02.106 --> 07:05.107
So?

07:08.512 --> 07:10.446
Okay, Annie has

07:10.448 --> 07:11.948
top-secret-clearance-level
knowledge

07:11.950 --> 07:13.349
of the following ops:

07:13.351 --> 07:16.886
Project Spartacus,
Operation Zyzyx,

07:16.888 --> 07:18.788
Operation Sentinel...

07:21.392 --> 07:22.792
Believe me,
if I could've chosen

07:22.794 --> 07:24.127
a different venue,
I would have.

07:24.129 --> 07:26.629
Could you have been
any more clinical?

07:26.631 --> 07:28.131
Well, this was
a significant snafu, Joan.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.367
Yours is not the only
resignation being considered.

07:30.369 --> 07:31.835
So, yes, for the time being,

07:31.837 --> 07:33.169
we get everything
on the record

07:33.171 --> 07:34.838
to eliminate any confusion.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.973
A vulnerabilities inventory?

07:36.975 --> 07:38.341
You know,
you can keep referring to her

07:38.343 --> 07:40.510
as operative Walker
all you want,

07:40.512 --> 07:42.245
but that's not gonna make this
feel any less personal.

07:42.247 --> 07:44.080
We're doing everything we can
to bring her back.

07:44.082 --> 07:46.016
We're holding strategy sessions
nonstop.

07:46.018 --> 07:47.251
Well, I hope so.

07:47.253 --> 07:51.021
We are doing what we can.

07:51.023 --> 07:52.689
She knew what
she was getting into.

07:52.691 --> 07:56.259
Well, I'm not so sure
she did, Arthur.

07:56.261 --> 07:59.195
Come on, what operative
truly understands the meaning

07:59.197 --> 08:04.066
of "We will deny
all knowledge"?

08:04.068 --> 08:05.768
Uh, I'm not sure
what you want me to say

08:05.770 --> 08:07.169
or what you want me
to do.

08:07.171 --> 08:09.037
I want you
to stop pretending

08:09.039 --> 08:11.340
that Annie
is just a line item,

08:11.342 --> 08:15.443
a thing to be
damage-controlled.

08:15.445 --> 08:18.447
Message received.

09:17.007 --> 09:19.007
I'm impressed.

09:19.009 --> 09:22.511
You have held out
longer than most.

09:22.513 --> 09:23.979
It's important
for you to hear

09:23.981 --> 09:25.747
that you're better
than the others, isn't it?

09:25.749 --> 09:28.283
I'm guessing you
didn't hear that much at home

09:28.285 --> 09:31.419
as a child.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.157
But Simon was more generous
with his affections.

09:45.599 --> 09:47.800
What did he tell you
about his operations?

09:47.802 --> 09:49.535
Nothing.

09:49.537 --> 09:51.437
He takes you to Cuba.

09:51.439 --> 09:52.938
His handler ends up dead.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.141
You he keeps alive.

09:55.143 --> 09:56.676
You keep asking me
the same questions,

09:56.678 --> 09:59.445
and I keep giving you
the same answers.

09:59.447 --> 10:02.448
So which one of us
is the stubborn one?

10:06.219 --> 10:08.187
Sir?

10:08.189 --> 10:09.655
I mean no disrespect,

10:09.657 --> 10:11.223
but it has been
more than two weeks

10:11.225 --> 10:12.458
since Annie was captured.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.626
When are we gonna get
off our asses

10:13.628 --> 10:14.627
and do something?

10:14.629 --> 10:16.328
But you meant
no disrespect.

10:16.330 --> 10:18.030
I felt I needed
to get your attention.

10:18.032 --> 10:19.232
Consider it gotten.

10:19.234 --> 10:20.867
Is that all
you came up here for?

10:20.869 --> 10:23.202
No, I came
to pitch you this.

10:23.204 --> 10:24.704
I've been researching
Lefortovo.

10:24.706 --> 10:27.540
I've drawn up some blueprints
based on the recollections

10:27.542 --> 10:28.574
of ex-prisoners.

10:28.576 --> 10:29.809
We have no confirmation

10:29.811 --> 10:30.810
that's where
they're holding her.

10:30.812 --> 10:31.911
That's where they kept

10:31.913 --> 10:33.046
Litvinenko and Rust.

10:33.048 --> 10:34.047
They're keeping her
at Lefortovo.

10:34.049 --> 10:35.481
I'm fairly certain.

10:35.483 --> 10:37.917
And I do realize
that no one's ever escaped,

10:37.919 --> 10:39.318
but I think I've found
some vulnerabilities.

10:39.320 --> 10:41.887
A small team might be able
to breach the prison

10:41.889 --> 10:43.022
via an adjacent tunnel.

10:43.024 --> 10:44.190
You're talking
about an underground,

10:44.192 --> 10:45.891
fortified prison,
smack dab in the middle

10:45.893 --> 10:47.593
of the sixth largest city
in the world.

10:47.595 --> 10:51.163
Even assuming we make it out,
what then?

10:51.165 --> 10:52.531
We can't control
the air space.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.666
We're over 200 miles
from the nearest border.

10:54.668 --> 10:55.734
Yeah, it's a risky gambit,
granted.

10:55.736 --> 10:58.938
It's a suicide mission.

10:58.940 --> 11:01.073
You think you're the only one
in this place

11:01.075 --> 11:02.441
to work up a rescue?

11:02.443 --> 11:04.243
I've had a team
constructing plans

11:04.245 --> 11:06.779
since Annie was taken.

11:06.781 --> 11:08.247
None of them
have been initiated

11:08.249 --> 11:10.282
because none of them
have been deemed feasible.

11:10.284 --> 11:11.583
What about
a negotiated release,

11:11.585 --> 11:13.185
some kind of spy swap?

11:13.187 --> 11:14.719
No, Russia won't even admit
they have her in custody,

11:14.721 --> 11:17.422
and we can't exactly admit
our part in anything.

11:17.424 --> 11:18.757
So you're telling me
Annie's fate is tied up

11:18.759 --> 11:20.358
in a game of liar's poker?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.927
Unless facts change
on the ground,

11:21.929 --> 11:22.961
there's nothing I can do.

11:22.963 --> 11:25.964
I wish that wasn't
the case.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.765
But it is.

11:56.728 --> 11:59.163
Nobody's coming for you.

11:59.165 --> 12:03.801
You understand that
by now, don't you?

12:03.803 --> 12:05.770
What are you afraid of?

12:05.772 --> 12:08.240
Being thought of as a traitor?
Is that it?

12:08.242 --> 12:09.274
Yes.

12:09.276 --> 12:11.276
Well, don't be.

12:11.278 --> 12:13.645
That word has
no meaning anymore.

12:13.647 --> 12:16.614
It hasn't had
for a long time.

12:16.616 --> 12:18.315

12:29.995 --> 12:32.996
It's easier that way.

12:40.271 --> 12:43.273
I'm left-handed.

♪ ♪

18:16.055 --> 18:17.588
All right,
let me get this straight.

18:17.590 --> 18:20.090
You staged an unsanctioned,
off-book, one-man jailbreak

18:20.092 --> 18:22.126
with an operative
from a competing spy service.

18:22.128 --> 18:24.361
That's what you took away
from our last discussion.

18:24.363 --> 18:26.730
- It worked.
- For the time being.

18:26.732 --> 18:28.098
If this thing went sideways,
I didn't want it

18:28.100 --> 18:29.366
to connect back to us.

18:29.368 --> 18:30.768
Plus Eyal
is exceptionally competent,

18:30.770 --> 18:33.972
and he owes Annie
a favor too.

18:33.974 --> 18:36.308
Can you get me Tel Aviv?

18:36.310 --> 18:38.477
I would've done it myself
if I could, just so you know.

18:38.479 --> 18:39.811
Did Joan know about this?

18:39.813 --> 18:41.447
Not beforehand, no.

18:41.449 --> 18:42.648
Does she know about it now?

18:42.650 --> 18:43.782
She's not
in her office yet.

18:43.784 --> 18:45.284
We've been trying
to reach her.

18:45.286 --> 18:48.287
Well, this does change
everything for the Russians.

18:48.289 --> 18:49.956
That was the idea.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.424
If I were to put myself
in the Russians' shoes,

18:51.426 --> 18:54.261
the proper play
is to shoot Annie on sight.

18:54.263 --> 18:55.929
You and I both know
she was gonna die

18:55.931 --> 18:57.464
in that prison.

18:57.466 --> 18:59.299
The escape at least gives her
a chance.

18:59.301 --> 19:00.767
What's the plan now?

19:00.769 --> 19:02.102
We've obtained clean I.D.s
and travel documents

19:02.104 --> 19:03.303
for both of them.

19:03.305 --> 19:04.771
They're gonna be on the 216
to Helsinki.

19:04.773 --> 19:06.139
They're traveling by train.

19:06.141 --> 19:07.473
Yeah, they have a car,

19:07.475 --> 19:09.475
but there'll be too many
roadblocks to avoid.

19:09.477 --> 19:11.477
Now, anything you can do,
any strings you can pull

19:11.479 --> 19:13.480
to give them
extra protection--

19:13.482 --> 19:15.648
We don't have any suitable
assets on the ground in Moscow,

19:15.650 --> 19:17.284
not after Lena burned
the covers.

19:17.286 --> 19:18.685
I've got Rivka Singer on two.

19:18.687 --> 19:21.188

19:21.190 --> 19:23.657

19:25.127 --> 19:26.760

19:28.331 --> 19:30.198
We'll have some reinforcements
catch up with the train there,

they're on their own.

19:35.005 --> 19:36.171

19:36.173 --> 19:39.007
We got a train to catch.

I have to make
a stop first.

Zarya Fischer.

19:47.450 --> 19:48.950
Yeah, well, so is a friend
of mine--Annie Walker.

19:48.952 --> 19:50.151
Have you ever heard
of her?

19:50.153 --> 19:52.354
My interrogator threatened
to hurt her

19:52.356 --> 19:54.556
to elicit a confession
from me.

19:54.558 --> 19:57.159
Well, interrogators
say a lot of things.

19:57.161 --> 19:58.894
99% of them are bullshit.

19:58.896 --> 20:00.830
I can't take that chance.

20:00.832 --> 20:03.533
Listen.

20:03.535 --> 20:05.468
Zarya's no good
to the F.S.B.

20:05.470 --> 20:06.802
unless they have you
in custody,

20:06.804 --> 20:08.704
so the best thing you can do
for her right now

20:08.706 --> 20:10.640
is keep your distance
and get home safely.

20:10.642 --> 20:12.842
I understand if you want
to go on without me.

20:14.979 --> 20:16.646

for me than I can already repay.

Look, whatever he
may have meant to you,

20:37.869 --> 20:40.570

20:40.572 --> 20:42.939
You don't owe him
in perpetuity.

20:42.941 --> 20:45.942

30:24.440 --> 30:25.741
You're sure here?

30:25.743 --> 30:28.010
That's what the map says.

30:36.185 --> 30:38.253
So what kind of questions
did he ask you?

30:38.255 --> 30:41.423
He wanted to know
about Simon's ops.

30:41.425 --> 30:42.524
What'd you tell him?

30:42.526 --> 30:44.226
Nothing.

30:44.228 --> 30:45.794
Not because I was trying to be
a hero or anything.

30:45.796 --> 30:49.131
Because I didn't know
the answers.

30:49.133 --> 30:51.099
And he didn't believe me.

30:51.101 --> 30:53.568
That's the scariest part.

31:19.898 --> 31:22.832
CIA sure likes to do things
the hard way.

31:31.579 --> 31:33.412
If Auggie says this is
the best way out of Russia,

31:33.414 --> 31:35.014
then this is
the best way out.

31:35.016 --> 31:37.216
I'm sure it's the best way out.

31:37.218 --> 31:38.784
But first we gotta figure out
a way in.

31:38.786 --> 31:40.519
I mean, there's Cyclone fencing
around the entire perimeter,

31:40.521 --> 31:42.888
barricades there,
there, there,

31:42.890 --> 31:46.257
30 or so infantry,
plus flight crew.

31:46.259 --> 31:49.561
I'm open to suggestions.

32:22.930 --> 32:24.297
Drop it.

32:37.644 --> 32:40.213
You look like you lost
a little weight in there.

32:40.215 --> 32:43.749
You should come
back to Israel with me.

32:43.751 --> 32:45.485
Safta Lavin will help you
fill up those uniforms

32:45.487 --> 32:46.653
in no time.

32:46.655 --> 32:50.157
I'm not sure
I can sell this.

32:50.159 --> 32:52.460
You know, I may have been
a little too quick

32:52.462 --> 32:54.929
to dismiss this gambit.

32:54.931 --> 32:56.797
After all, my people,
we know something

32:56.799 --> 32:58.131
about counterstrikes,
you know?

32:58.133 --> 33:00.167
The Raid of Entebbe,

33:00.169 --> 33:02.169
the Six-Day War.

33:02.171 --> 33:04.505
I had a similar experience
in Lebanon myself

33:04.507 --> 33:07.675
when I was in service.

33:07.677 --> 33:09.410
Was a walk in the park
compared to this.

33:09.412 --> 33:11.111
Wheels up in two minutes.

33:11.113 --> 33:14.081
We'll get there.

33:17.086 --> 33:18.686
♪ ♪

33:41.378 --> 33:44.814
Like I said...

33:44.816 --> 33:47.784
A walk in the park.

34:35.065 --> 34:36.264
Can I ask you a question?

34:36.266 --> 34:39.068
Yes, my eyes are
naturally this color.

34:39.070 --> 34:41.237
I'm serious.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.572
I want to make sure
that you didn't sign up

34:42.574 --> 34:44.174
for this mission

34:44.176 --> 34:45.708
because of that file
you gave me.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.945
The one
about Simon Fischer?

34:49.915 --> 34:52.049
With or without the intel
in that file,

34:52.051 --> 34:54.418
I would've ended up
where I ended up.

34:54.420 --> 34:56.853
I made my own bed.

34:56.856 --> 34:58.755
I just want to make sure
that you don't have

34:58.757 --> 34:59.957
any feelings of guilt or--

34:59.959 --> 35:02.593
Guilt?

35:02.595 --> 35:05.930
I'm Jewish.
What do I know from guilt?

35:05.932 --> 35:08.766
No, the truth is,
Auggie caught me at a good time.

35:08.768 --> 35:11.769
I was gonna be
in the neighborhood anyway.

35:14.306 --> 35:15.639
Yeah?

35:15.641 --> 35:17.774
Yeah.

35:17.776 --> 35:20.777
I got this thing
for Balalaikas.

35:34.892 --> 35:39.831
Whatever happened
in that raid in Lebanon?

35:39.833 --> 35:42.834
I gotta admit,
it wasn't our finest hour.

35:42.836 --> 35:45.137
We were all so green.

35:45.139 --> 35:48.340
Yeah, but that was then.
This is now.

35:48.342 --> 35:51.343
Different day,
better team.

36:01.121 --> 36:02.589
- There's a problem.
- What happened?

36:02.591 --> 36:04.691
- Plane stopped.
- No, no, it can't stop.

36:04.693 --> 36:06.259
We just lost our window.

36:33.576 --> 36:36.978
Wasn't sure
I'd get these back.

36:36.980 --> 36:39.981
I had less doubts
about you.

36:46.389 --> 36:50.725
Mark Sanderson.

36:50.727 --> 36:52.394
I'm guessing this is
not your real name.

36:52.396 --> 36:54.896
Who are you really?

36:54.898 --> 36:57.732
A friend.

36:57.734 --> 37:00.435
I congratulate you, Annie.

37:00.437 --> 37:04.205
You obviously inspire
great loyalty from your friends.

37:04.207 --> 37:07.175
Shame you can't inspire
more intelligence.

37:12.581 --> 37:14.615
I'm guessing that was a gift
from someone.

37:14.617 --> 37:16.918
Your dad?

37:16.920 --> 37:20.521
Grandfather.

37:20.523 --> 37:22.790
Holding on to something
like that

37:22.792 --> 37:27.028
says a lot about you.

37:27.030 --> 37:30.064
If you think you uncovered
sentimentality in me,

37:30.066 --> 37:32.300
I caution you not to read
too much into that.

37:32.302 --> 37:36.371
It says you're not
Oleg Yursky.

37:36.373 --> 37:37.773
You stepped in for him
at the last minute,

37:37.775 --> 37:39.241
and I think that's because
you were afraid

37:39.243 --> 37:44.046
of something I might say.

37:44.048 --> 37:45.948
And what would I be
afraid of?

37:45.950 --> 37:49.786
That I might say that you,
Alexei Vershinin,

37:49.788 --> 37:51.821
are a traitor
to the F.S.B.

37:53.292 --> 37:54.291
A traitor?

37:54.293 --> 37:55.659
Mmhmm.

37:55.661 --> 37:57.094
That's what Simon told me.

37:57.096 --> 37:58.896
That you're double-dealing.

37:58.898 --> 38:00.665
Embezzling.
You're making this up.

38:00.667 --> 38:02.434
You don't know what
you're talking about.

38:02.436 --> 38:03.568
Oh, but I do.

38:03.570 --> 38:05.470
It's all in the file
we assembled

38:05.472 --> 38:07.839
on Simon Fischer.

38:07.841 --> 38:08.973
I'm Mossad, by the way.

38:08.975 --> 38:11.009
This is ridiculous.

38:11.011 --> 38:12.644
Maybe.

38:12.646 --> 38:15.080
But if anything I'm saying
even has a grain of truth,

38:15.082 --> 38:19.184
I wouldn't want to be you.

38:19.186 --> 38:22.521
A person in your position
could use an exit strategy...

38:22.523 --> 38:25.524
such as a new identity.

38:29.462 --> 38:30.696
That passport is clean.

38:30.698 --> 38:33.098
There's access to funds.

38:33.100 --> 38:35.100
The F.S.B.
might never find you.

38:35.102 --> 38:36.969
By this time tomorrow,
you could be leading

38:36.971 --> 38:39.505
a completely new life
with a completely new identity.

38:39.507 --> 38:43.309
Become Mark Sanderson.

38:43.311 --> 38:46.679
It's an even trade
for letting us go.

38:46.681 --> 38:49.348
Let's assume for a second
what you say is right.

38:49.350 --> 38:51.017
What's stopping me
from taking this package

38:51.019 --> 38:53.352
and shooting you both
in the head, huh?

38:53.354 --> 38:56.989
If we're not both home
and safe in 24 hours,

38:56.991 --> 38:59.692
the details of that identity
will be sent to the F.S.B.

38:59.694 --> 39:01.127
You'll be signing
your own death certificate.

39:01.129 --> 39:05.064
And how would I know
you wouldn't do that anyway?

39:05.066 --> 39:08.535
You'll have to take
my word for it.

39:08.537 --> 39:11.304
You said you could tell
if I was lying.

39:11.306 --> 39:14.206
Look at me.

39:14.208 --> 39:17.176
Am I not telling the truth?

39:54.716 --> 39:57.618
You will be reported dead.

39:57.620 --> 40:00.087
And as long as you stay
that way,

40:00.089 --> 40:01.755
you'll find it easy
to make your exit.

40:01.757 --> 40:05.025
Nearest port
is 20 kilometers north.

40:13.302 --> 40:16.304
May God help us all.

Hey.

You okay?

40:32.956 --> 40:34.089
