14:15.920 --> 14:16.956
- Fine.
- That's it.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.496
- It's all right. We're fine.
- [Sean yells]

14:18.520 --> 14:19.351
Ow!

14:19.440 --> 14:21.320
But I gotta talk to you
about something serious.

14:21.640 --> 14:24.917
- What?
- Why my hands are so cold this morning.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.776
- I can't go to work with these cold hands.
- Okay.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.395
I'ma need to warm them up
on that ass of yours just for a second.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.676
Oh, my God. But your hands are so cold!

14:31.760 --> 14:32.776
[Miles] Just for a second.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.995
[Ashley] You're ridiculous.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.117
- [sighs]
- I know. I know. I know.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.270
[sighs]

14:37.360 --> 14:39.079
- You feel better?
- It's so nice.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.856
- What am I supposed to do? It's just...
- I bet it is so nice.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.400
- It's a privilege.
- 'Cause it's nice.

14:42.960 --> 14:43.960
I gotta go.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.880
I love you.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.391
Love you too.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.039
Whoo!

14:49.120 --> 14:50.395
S, you cheated.

14:50.480 --> 14:51.960
[hip-hop music playing]

14:52.960 --> 14:55.191
[woman shouting indistinctly]

14:57.440 --> 14:58.999
[indistinct chatter]

14:59.080 --> 15:00.296
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What's up, Collin?

15:00.320 --> 15:01.356
What's up, Miles?

15:05.040 --> 15:07.271
[newscaster] <i>After a pursuit
in West Oakland last night,</i>

15:07.360 --> 15:10.432
<i>a dramatic standoff with police
left one suspect dead.</i>

15:10.520 --> 15:11.670
This the shit you saw?

15:11.760 --> 15:15.231
<i>He was evading arrest by fleeing down
Adeline Street towards West Grand...</i>

15:15.320 --> 15:17.312
- You see this cop?
- Yeah, I saw him.

15:17.400 --> 15:19.256
<i>...police officers fired four shots,
killing the man.</i>

15:19.280 --> 15:20.776
Why the fuck is he wearing
his hat all low?

15:20.800 --> 15:22.473
Why would you take a picture like that?

15:22.560 --> 15:24.472
- This cop see you?
- [Collin] Yeah.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.313
Hey, bro, let me get that square.

15:26.400 --> 15:27.516
What, then you just left?

15:27.600 --> 15:29.536
I mean, it was after 11:00.
What I'm supposed to do?

15:29.560 --> 15:31.456
- James always be talking that shit.
- But you're a witness.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.176
You're not gonna leave
a statement or some shit?

15:33.200 --> 15:35.576
Oh, yeah. "Hello, police?
I'd like to report a murder you did.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.240
I was out after curfew.
Yeah, I'm a convicted felon."

15:38.320 --> 15:39.515
- All right.
- "Back to jail?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.956
Yeah, tomorrow works for me. What time?

15:42.040 --> 15:43.713
Fo sho. Mmm-hmm.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.995
Yup. Okay."

15:45.600 --> 15:46.600
[sighs]

15:48.800 --> 15:51.634
Bro, what the fuck is this
green juice shit doing up in here?

15:51.760 --> 15:52.760
It's good for you.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.395
- How much?
- $10.

15:54.480 --> 15:55.675
- What?
- What?

15:55.760 --> 15:57.256
What is this, the blood of fucking Jesus?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.556
The fuck is in it that it costs $10?

15:59.640 --> 16:02.280
- Let me get one.
- I'm sorry, what?

16:03.880 --> 16:06.679
[mumbling]

16:13.040 --> 16:14.235
[door opens]

16:15.480 --> 16:17.856
[Val] All right, we are all set.
Thank you so much for choosing Commander.

16:17.880 --> 16:19.553
<i>Namaste,</i> Val.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.999
Your aura is looking
very transcendent this morning.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.675
Did you finally purge yourself
of your superiority complex or...

16:26.120 --> 16:28.510
No, you're still...
Still working on it? Okay.

16:33.160 --> 16:36.836
- Oh, is that a green juice?
- Is it? Oh. Oh, yeah.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.376
I guess it is. You know,
it's just part of my regimen these days.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.736
A little green juice,
a little, what's that class you be taking?

16:41.760 --> 16:43.160
- SoulCycle.
- SoulCycle.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.993
Yeah, a little... My soul is so...

16:46.040 --> 16:46.951
Shit.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.238
- [chuckles]
- Ah... It's healthy.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.875
I am just glad
you're taking care of yourself.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.235
Most definitely.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.240
Um...

16:58.200 --> 16:59.998
Collin was involved in a shootout

17:00.120 --> 17:02.077
- last night with the police.
- What?

17:02.160 --> 17:03.696
I wasn't... That's not true.
That's not what happened.

17:03.720 --> 17:04.597
- He's not...
- Who were you out...

17:04.680 --> 17:05.776
- No.
- Very exciting. People died.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.536
- Who were you out with?
- He's fucking with you, babe.

17:07.560 --> 17:10.358
- Uh, sorry, Val. Front desk girl.
- [phone ringing]

17:10.440 --> 17:12.520
- Person. Front desk, front desk person.
- Get going.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.455
- I'm going now.
- Thank you for calling Commander,

17:14.480 --> 17:16.949
where we strive for excellence
in relocations...

17:25.640 --> 17:28.234
- Fuck Val! Fuck Val.
- [all groaning]

17:28.319 --> 17:30.630
She disloyal, she uppity,

17:30.720 --> 17:32.757
and she permanently
in downward bitch pose.

17:32.840 --> 17:33.751
That ain't my fault.

17:33.840 --> 17:36.560
Motherfucker, you're bugging.
That's his ex-girl.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.856
Yorkie, stop saying "bugging."
You live on the West Coast now.

17:38.880 --> 17:40.880
You're a Californian.
Get with the fucking program.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.196
Hey, Miles. You bugging.

17:43.280 --> 17:46.114
- [all laughing]
- Shut the fuck up, Tel! Shut the fuck up!

17:46.200 --> 17:48.635
Hey, she got this nigga a job,

17:48.720 --> 17:50.951
and she lets you guys
both drive the truck home.

17:51.040 --> 17:53.016
- Come on, get out this boy's head.
- Thank you, Tel.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.736
She gotta let us drive the truck
to and from work.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.638
That's how we get to and from work, man.

17:56.760 --> 17:58.776
She's... I'm not saying she's not smart.
She plenty smart.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.160
I'm just saying it's a shame
she only uses that intelligence

18:01.240 --> 18:03.152
toward being a higher caliber of bitch.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.536
- That's all I'm saying.
- You got to simmer.

18:04.560 --> 18:05.755
Simmer, man.

18:05.840 --> 18:08.674
Hey, he only defending her
'cause he like that vegan Kwik Way pussy

18:08.760 --> 18:10.216
that he giving her. That's the whole shit.

18:10.240 --> 18:13.950
- [all] Oh!
- [laughs] That's too far. That's too far.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.416
You don't get to eat no pussy
'cause that rusty-ass grill in your mouth.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.318
- [all] Oh!
- [laughing]

18:20.760 --> 18:21.989
[engine starts]

18:22.120 --> 18:24.237
[hip-hop music playing]

18:42.600 --> 18:45.195
[Collin] Oh, shit,
tall-ass bike, big-ass beard.

18:45.280 --> 18:48.398
[Miles] Oh, gentrification
on a whole other level.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.239
Who are these people?

19:04.920 --> 19:06.957
[buzzing]

19:08.440 --> 19:10.671
[Patrick] Okay, there's Leon.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.991
Cynthia. Marvin.

19:14.160 --> 19:17.870
Where's Vivian?
Such an evasive little firecracker.

19:17.960 --> 19:19.235
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.391
Don't have Santiago and Dante
facing each other.

19:21.480 --> 19:24.234
They... They do not get along. Please.

19:26.200 --> 19:30.479
My work looks to make people fall in love.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.631
So I love trees?

19:32.720 --> 19:34.791
That's from my last exhibit.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.270
I superimposed photographs of oak trees

19:37.360 --> 19:39.716
over neighborhoods
where they used to grow,

19:39.800 --> 19:42.872
to remind people
that they used to be everywhere.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.792
Now they're just on the damn street signs.

19:45.240 --> 19:48.153
Oh, boys, they're chopping us down.

19:48.680 --> 19:52.640
These people were all forced out
for the new Oakland.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.031
Which is why faces.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Eyes.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.478
To stare is to see.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.920
Come on. Come here for a minute.

20:05.440 --> 20:07.636
Just stare at each other for a moment.

20:07.720 --> 20:11.555
Oh, no, man, we're close enough.

20:11.640 --> 20:13.696
We got kinda like
a Calvin and Hobbes thing going on.

20:13.720 --> 20:14.995
This isn't sexual.

20:16.160 --> 20:18.436
See, but now it is,
'cause now you said that.

20:18.520 --> 20:22.036
This is about finding the soul. [shushing]

20:22.120 --> 20:24.416
- I know. Okay. All right.
- All right. Okay. All right. Okay.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.216
- [Patrick] Look.
- Fuck, your eyes match your jumpsuit.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.436
- Don't talk about the emeralds.
- [Patrick] Look deep.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
Connect.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.794
Understand.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.798
Fucking, don't fucking do it!

20:53.880 --> 20:55.234
[laughing]

20:55.920 --> 20:58.594
Oh, look, Patrick,
you a swell motherfucker, man,

20:58.680 --> 21:01.912
and I dig everything about you,
except that shit right there.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.480
I'm sorry. [laughs]

21:08.520 --> 21:09.840
Yes, I got it already.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.636
Hey, man, you gonna
have to move your car, bruh.

21:12.720 --> 21:13.870
We got to get out.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.080
Bruh, you gotta move, boy! Let's go!

21:18.760 --> 21:21.070
Look at this fucking transplant.
What's he doing?

21:21.160 --> 21:22.389
[cell phone rings]

21:23.920 --> 21:26.071
- Hey, Mom.
- Move your shit, bruh!

21:28.440 --> 21:31.399
Oh, you're not gonna listen?
You don't hear me?

21:31.480 --> 21:32.736
- [Collin] Yeah, that is Miles.
- Yeah.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.194
[Miles] He's just ignoring me.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.273
- [Collin] He said hi.
- Move, bruh!

21:36.360 --> 21:37.656
Yo, I think we could be there in, like...

21:37.680 --> 21:39.216
- Fifteen minutes.
- [Miles] You kidding me?

21:39.240 --> 21:42.438
[horn blaring]

21:50.120 --> 21:54.239
Hey! Hey! Do you hear
the fucking ringing sound?

21:54.720 --> 21:57.360
- Move your shit! Son of a...
- Mom, I gotta go.

21:57.440 --> 22:00.114
[soul music playing]

22:16.520 --> 22:18.876
[men screaming in video game]

22:28.280 --> 22:29.509
Who is this little homie?

22:29.960 --> 22:31.519
[Collin] Me think he my stepbrother.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.392
Why is he drinking out of
your dinosaur mug you made in fifth grade?

22:35.480 --> 22:36.596
Mugasaurus.

22:36.680 --> 22:38.433
[slurping]

22:38.520 --> 22:40.536
[Miles] You just gonna let him
drink out your mug like that?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.120
You just gonna let him do that, Collin?

22:43.320 --> 22:44.913
Mom! Mom!

22:45.000 --> 22:47.071
[Nancy] I'm in the bathroom, sir!

22:47.720 --> 22:50.519
What? My... You...
That's my... This is my room!

22:50.600 --> 22:52.398
- You gave him my room?
- [Nancy] I know.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.800
Mom! He is living in my room?

22:53.880 --> 22:56.793
[Nancy] This is why I told you
to come over so we could talk about

22:56.880 --> 23:01.875
- what your, you know, long-term plan is.
- Ma! I am moving home in two days!

23:02.760 --> 23:04.638
[Nancy]
You really couldn't find an apartment?

23:05.240 --> 23:07.516
The whole damn city
got a "For Rent" sign on it.

23:07.600 --> 23:11.879
"Have you ever been convicted of a felony?
If so, what is the nature of your crime?"

23:11.960 --> 23:14.759
- Well, whose fault is that?
- Damn.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.514
Well, I just assumed
you'd only be here for a little bit.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.832
- And eventually you and Val...
- Mom. Mom.

23:20.960 --> 23:23.919
- She came by a couple of days ago.
- We are not together right now.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.952
- Okay. Okay.
- Okay. Okay.

23:27.360 --> 23:30.398
Well, Jimmy and all my drums
are in guest room A now.

23:30.480 --> 23:32.216
- I saw that.
- [Nancy] Clear the rest of Shanai's stuff

23:32.240 --> 23:34.914
off her old bed
and you can have that room for a bit.

23:35.000 --> 23:38.710
But that is not your room.
That is my guest room B.

23:38.800 --> 23:40.359
Where is your sister anyway?

23:40.480 --> 23:44.599
Shanai's in Bali teaching
non-Eurocentric beauty techniques.

23:44.680 --> 23:45.830
Right on, right on.

23:45.920 --> 23:51.279
Hmm. Took out a second mortgage
on this house to send her to school.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.920
I'm going to be paying it off
for the rest of my life.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.736
Well, why don't you just
sell the house then?

23:55.760 --> 23:59.356
- She is not going to sell our house.
- I am not selling my house.

24:00.040 --> 24:01.997
I'll be damned if I move out
of this neighborhood

24:02.080 --> 24:04.595
now that they got good food and shit.

24:05.440 --> 24:06.440
Oh.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.315
- Give this to his better half.
- Yeah.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.736
- Tell her it's from me, please.
- Okay.

24:11.760 --> 24:13.176
- What is that?
- Get your hand out of my pocket.

24:13.200 --> 24:16.830
Something for Ashley and my godson.
And you'll just lose it.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.149
You're not wrong.

24:18.240 --> 24:19.674
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

24:22.000 --> 24:25.835
Hey, hey, hey,
look at this good-looking man!

24:25.920 --> 24:27.718
- Hey, what's happening, Marty?
- Oh!

24:28.560 --> 24:30.631
- How you doing, bro?
- I'm good, man.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.536
- Staying out of trouble?
- Yeah, man, I'm good.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.096
- Hey, what's up, Marty?
- Hey, what's up?

24:34.120 --> 24:37.158
- Nancy, uh, can I have this?
- [Nancy] What?

24:37.240 --> 24:38.799
Whatcha gonna do with those?

24:39.280 --> 24:41.431
[hair dryer whirring]

24:41.520 --> 24:43.159
[indistinct chatter]

24:43.240 --> 24:46.358
Flat irons! Top of the line, metallic,

24:46.440 --> 24:49.239
heat-absorbent, alloy metal.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.240
Uh-uh.

24:53.760 --> 24:57.071
Who the fuck said
you could talk in Mama Liz's shop?

24:57.160 --> 24:58.196
[women] Mmm-hmm.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.316
Oh, shit.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.153
This is finnabit a show you want to watch.

25:01.240 --> 25:04.790
We've got ceramic and titanium,
some for home, some for travel.

25:04.880 --> 25:06.234
Wide plates for long weaves,

25:06.320 --> 25:09.074
short plates for thinking
about going all natural.

25:09.520 --> 25:11.432
Boy, please. Those look old.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.816
These are from the cosmetology school
after just one class.

25:13.840 --> 25:15.399
Out the box, but not quite out of gas.

25:15.480 --> 25:17.496
They use the best to teach
the worst to become the best,

25:17.520 --> 25:19.256
and the best is here
and that's what you deserve,

25:19.280 --> 25:21.715
so forget the rest.
I mean, come on, people!

25:21.800 --> 25:23.056
[woman] I don't know about that.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.232
Well, you haven't even
told me how much yet.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.915
And Mama Liz does not enjoy suspense.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.196
- I don't even like suspense movies.
- I don't either.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.317
- Fuck Alfred Hitchcock!
- [woman] Right on.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.359
- Fuck him.
- And M. Shyamalan Night...

25:35.440 --> 25:37.636
That motherfucker could kiss my ass too.

25:37.720 --> 25:39.576
- Makes me nervous.
- [woman] There's always a twist.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.795
Let me ask you something.

25:40.880 --> 25:42.792
How much is that one
you're holding right now?

25:43.440 --> 25:47.434
- $140.
- $140? I would never!

25:47.520 --> 25:50.399
These have gotta be
at least a third of the price of that,

25:50.480 --> 25:52.080
and hand to God, I bet they work better.

25:52.160 --> 25:53.160
Okay.

25:53.600 --> 25:55.751
Who the fuck is this white boy
y'all let in my shop?

25:55.840 --> 25:57.240
- Tina!
- What?

25:57.320 --> 26:00.711
I'm just a West Oakland homegrown Bay boy
about his town business.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.872
Matter of fact, 100% of the proceeds today
are actually going

26:03.960 --> 26:06.873
towards bilingual education
for the youth of Oakland.

26:07.000 --> 26:10.072
And it's gonna help men
transitioning out of incarceration

26:10.160 --> 26:12.800
towards finding a better life
and having a second chance.

26:12.880 --> 26:17.671
Because that is what our community
so desperately needs.

26:18.080 --> 26:19.376
- [women agreeing]
- I feel it, you feel it,

26:19.400 --> 26:20.880
we all feel it, we all know it.

26:20.960 --> 26:21.791
Come on.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.712
[woman] They all deserve a second chance.

26:24.720 --> 26:26.837
- Here we go.
- [woman 2] It's on now.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.632
[women] Ooh...

26:43.520 --> 26:44.715
How we know these work?

26:55.320 --> 26:56.549
I think it look good.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.033
You know, it is so uncomfortable

27:00.120 --> 27:02.112
to have to fit this shit on my belt, man.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.635
Oh, right.
Plausible deniability ruined. Thank you.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.359
- Shut up.
- Thank you very much.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.556
That reminds me, man.

27:08.760 --> 27:12.436
Made $600. $300 is very much yours.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.035
No, bruh, you keep that
for La Raza preschool or whatever.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.616
How do you mean?
You know how family work, man.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.216
I got some, you got some.
Whatcha talking about?

27:18.240 --> 27:19.240
[cell phones chime]

27:23.120 --> 27:25.351
You just get this text
about Nak's co-worker's party?

27:25.440 --> 27:26.635
Yeah, you trying to go?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.995
- Nope.
- Nope.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.878
[Ashley] Yo, Miles!

27:30.320 --> 27:32.357
Miles, can you please come upstairs?

27:32.960 --> 27:37.000
Well, hello, Collin's perm!

27:37.440 --> 27:40.000
- That looks fucking terrible.
- Thank you.

27:40.080 --> 27:41.120
I mean, if you gonna perm,

27:41.200 --> 27:43.016
why don't you go
wherever your mom or Val went?

27:43.040 --> 27:44.936
- I wasn't... Come on.
- Nancy's hair looks great.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.713
The hell you doing talking to Val for?

27:46.800 --> 27:48.837
<i>Calmate!</i> I didn't break
the picket line, nigga.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.354
I just follow her on social medias.

27:50.480 --> 27:53.598
You could all be friends with Val still.
She's, like, a really good person.

27:53.680 --> 27:54.875
No, the fuck we can't!

27:54.960 --> 27:55.960
- Fuck Val!
- Okay. Wow.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.071
And, baby, unfollow Val on the medias!

27:58.160 --> 27:59.879
[cell phone vibrating]

28:03.400 --> 28:04.400
Hi.

28:05.680 --> 28:09.594
Um, I had to take my hair out today for...

28:09.680 --> 28:12.957
for this something and...

28:13.960 --> 28:16.520
Now I need to get it braided
back again before tomorrow.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.080
Okay.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.871
And you're the only one
who can get it done before 11:00.

28:22.600 --> 28:23.840
Why's it have to get done by...

28:25.560 --> 28:28.758
Right. Why'd you take your hair out?

28:29.440 --> 28:32.911
It was profitable to do so.

28:33.000 --> 28:35.120
Look, I'm really not trying
to make this a "us" thing.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.119
I just really have to get my hair braided.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.634
Fine. Let's do it
at your mom's house, okay?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.234
I have to return a bowl anyway.

28:43.320 --> 28:46.040
And this is my study time,
so you need to help me memorize stuff.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.231
It has to actually be study time.

28:48.800 --> 28:50.696
[Collin] "The tendency to judge
the strength of arguments

28:50.720 --> 28:53.474
based on the plausibility
of their conclusions,

28:53.560 --> 28:55.392
rather than how strong it is."

28:55.480 --> 28:56.516
Belief bias effect.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.034
- Yes. Okay.
- Next.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.519
"The tendency to attribute
one's own actions to external causes

29:01.600 --> 29:03.136
while attributing other people's behaviors

29:03.160 --> 29:04.856
- to internal causes."
- Blame gaming. Blame gaming.

29:04.880 --> 29:07.315
You blame the game.
It's actor observer bias.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.311
- Yes.
- Yes!

29:08.400 --> 29:10.392
What are you saying before the answer?

29:10.480 --> 29:13.359
Oh, you're gonna love this.
This is absolutely your fault.

29:13.480 --> 29:14.596
- I love that.
- [chuckles]

29:15.680 --> 29:18.149
I made up, like, slang words
to help me remember things.

29:18.240 --> 29:22.632
Oh, shit. Look at you out here innovating.
See, she is still town. I knew it.

29:23.280 --> 29:24.919
I'm still town. Who said I'm not town?

29:25.000 --> 29:27.216
Nah, I mean, people just be
saying things on the street, girl...

29:27.240 --> 29:29.311
But it's cool. [chuckles]

29:29.400 --> 29:31.790
What, uh, what is this vase one?

29:32.320 --> 29:34.789
- Oh, you see a vase?
- Why you say it like that?

29:35.760 --> 29:38.673
[gasps] Ooh! It's two faces though!

29:38.760 --> 29:42.436
"Rubin's vase.
The image is fundamentally ambiguous.

29:42.520 --> 29:46.070
People perceive a vase or faces,
but not both at the same time."

29:46.600 --> 29:48.557
All right, so apparently you like vases.

29:48.680 --> 29:51.798
- Oh, I got you. Facevasin.
- [laughs]

29:51.880 --> 29:54.236
- Facevasin'. No, try it out.
- No. You...

29:54.320 --> 29:56.312
- Facevasin'.
- You can't just keep saying it...

29:56.440 --> 29:57.496
- Facevasin'.
- ...and think it's gonna...

29:57.520 --> 29:59.576
It's gotta be like real slang
so it'll stick in my head.

29:59.600 --> 30:01.717
I'm sprinkling it though. Facevasin'.

30:02.440 --> 30:04.113
- [laughing]
- [chuckles]

30:04.200 --> 30:05.395
- Hey.
- What?

30:06.080 --> 30:07.753
You know I'm a free bird tomorrow, right?

30:10.760 --> 30:12.479
- Yes, I do know.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:14.040 --> 30:15.633
- I'm happy for you.
- Me too.

30:23.240 --> 30:26.950
You gonna hang out of car windows
and curse at people then, too?

30:29.120 --> 30:31.016
- Why would I do that?
- I don't know. You tell me.

30:31.040 --> 30:32.816
I got a complaint today
that one of our trucks

30:32.840 --> 30:35.639
was just honking and yelling at people.

30:35.720 --> 30:37.880
A black guy with dreads
was just screaming at everyone.

30:37.960 --> 30:38.791
Nah, nah, nah, that's...

30:38.880 --> 30:40.256
- You don't have all the information.
- Okay.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.749
So what happened,
Miles was honking the horn because...

30:42.840 --> 30:43.840
Miles.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.856
- There was a dude that wouldn't get...
- Wait, Miles was honking?

30:45.880 --> 30:47.256
He was the one who was honking the horn.

30:47.280 --> 30:49.776
- We set it up so you would be the driver.
- I was driving the truck. I know.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.176
- No, I was... Nah.
- We talked about this.

30:51.200 --> 30:51.997
I was driving.

30:52.120 --> 30:53.536
- Keep your head straight.
- I was driving,

30:53.560 --> 30:54.789
but if he reach across me

30:54.880 --> 30:56.416
and honk the horn,
then what I'm supposed to do?

30:56.440 --> 30:58.480
Collin, just take some responsibility
for the things

30:58.520 --> 30:59.656
that are happening around you.

30:59.680 --> 31:01.433
I'm not denying it. I'm just saying

31:01.520 --> 31:06.037
that maybe this time it wasn't
the black guy with dreads that did it.

31:11.320 --> 31:12.674
[sighs]

31:13.400 --> 31:14.800
[sighs]

31:14.880 --> 31:16.155
I know you're trying.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.880
At least you don't wear
that fucking grill anymore.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.673
Now if you could just

31:24.520 --> 31:27.115
get rid of all this hair.

31:31.080 --> 31:34.790
- You'd almost look...
- Like, less blamable?

31:36.200 --> 31:39.716
"Not the hair, bruh.
It's my identity, bruh."

31:41.320 --> 31:42.356
It is.

31:42.440 --> 31:46.400
Yeah, well, your identity is [sighs] done.

31:47.520 --> 31:48.556
And I gotta go.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.197
I got it. Thanks.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.480
- Can we... Is that?
- Yeah.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.960
- Okay.
- Thanks.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.075
[sighs]

32:29.280 --> 32:32.990
Okay, this is why
I didn't want to come to your place.

32:33.440 --> 32:36.512
[Nancy] Collin! It's 10:45, babe.

32:36.640 --> 32:39.109
- Thank you, Nancy!
- [Nancy] Sorry to interrupt.

32:40.760 --> 32:41.760
Um...

32:46.680 --> 32:47.680
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.919

01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:10.950
- Of fucking course.
- Oh, Collin!

01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.096
I got a little somethin'- somethin'

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.349
Celebrate your freedom.

Cool jacket, man.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.312
[Sid] Hey, all right.
There's some new blood.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:00:59.720

- I dig it.
- Oh, shit.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:13.036
Same tattoo, man.

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.274

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.438
Come on in, man.
You guys are welcome here anytime.

Yeah, that's right.

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:21.751
I moved down here from Portland
about a year ago.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.194
Finally found my home.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:24.915
Hey, thank you, Sid.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.276

Yes, you are a great dancer.

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:45.157
- Hello. Hi, there.
- What's up?

01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.155
All right, pig on a shirt.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.637
- Nak?
- Wow. What's up?

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.157
Oh! Man, you never respond to my invites.

01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:05.715
- I mean...
- And this was a weird one to come to.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:08.440
- Yes.
- It's one of our CEO's monthly mixers.

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:09.636
Define mixer.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.030
Well, right now,
it's mixed 150 white people

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:14.635
with, now, three black people.

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.189
- Hmm.
- Oh, Terry, this is Collin.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.078
Terry and I worked
at Youth Radio together.

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160
How's it going, man?

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.240
What is that?

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:23.320
It's goat cheese.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:25.469
What's the little leaf?

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.736
Yo, what's going on, everybody?

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.936
- How's it going? Hey! Hey, you guys good?
- Hey, man, all right.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.713
You guys need any drank?

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:34.680
- Hey, hey, no. I'm good.
- Nah, you sure? You're good?

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:37.070
- All right. Thank you.
- Thank you, Sid. Thank you, Sid.

01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.276
[Sid] Whoa!

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.590
Uh-uh, sorry,
there's just no cups on the table.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:44.512
Let me tell you, this right here...

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:49.959
This is an original
Oakland oak tree stump.

01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.396
That's 140 years old right there.

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:55.359
Was. Look at all those rings.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.271
- Wow.
- Amazing.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:57.536
[Sid] Well, hey, you just let me know.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:59.711
There's plenty of drank
in the kitchen, homies.

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:00.950
Feel free.

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:07.038
So I'm gonna go get some "drank"
from the kitchen.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.600
Get me whatever you having.

01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.399
[Miles] Oh, what in the...

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:14.633
[gasps] No!

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:20.190
Kwik Way does not cater, people!

01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:22.274
It's quick,

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.595
it's around the way.

01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:25.440
It's in the name.

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.559
This is some jank ass shit right here.

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:29.520
[Terry laughing]

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:31.953
[Terry coughs]

01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:35.955
- You good, bruh?
- Yeah, I'm good, bruh.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.277
Oh, the grill.

01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.760
You have a grill in.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:41.910
Wow.

01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:46.995
You know, you don't have to
act ghetto to hang out here.

01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:49.115
Welcome to Oakland.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.000
Have fun, bud. [chuckles]

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.560
- Oh, man.
- [Nak] Oh, Lord.

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:04.394
- Oh, God, what happened?
- Some hipster kid by the drinks,

01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:05.709
full on culture vulture.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.111
- "What it do, my bruh. It's lit."
- No. No, no, no.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.392
I'm like, um, "Don't talk like that.
That's not you."

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.516
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.670
Somebody had to tell him.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.536
You know what? I made two more
in the kitchen, I'll be right back.

01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.630
Oh, my goodness.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.079
[sighs] It's so...

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.040
Oh, man, I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be here. I'm telling you.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.959
- Fuck.
- Yo, what up, my man?

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.430

- [Nak] No, wait, Terry!
- No.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.296
[Collin] I knew
we shouldn't have come here.

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:46.280
- God fucking damn it.
- What the fuck ever, bruh.

01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:48.496

What the fuck, man, and then what?

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:12.696

You wanna act brand-new, then fine.

01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:51.994
Go ahead. Be a hipster,
get a tech job or some shit.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.515
And go act like you don't know
where the fuck you from!

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.956
I ain't got to prove to nobody
where the fuck I'm from!

01:07:57.040 --> 01:07:58.269
Oh, good for you!

You ain't gotta do shit!
You ain't gotta...

You ain't gotta worry about you changing
up your clothes or your lifestyle.

You ain't gotta worry

01:08:53.319 --> 01:08:54.993
- No, and you know...
- Why? Why?

01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.640
- Come the fuck on!
- But... But why?

01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:00.555
'Cause you know I don't say that shit!

01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:03.075
But what? So it's okay for me
to call you nigga, nigga?

01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:05.015
You been calling me that
since we were 12 years old.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.776
I'm not gonna stop you now.
Do what the fuck you want to,

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:08.616
- say what you want.
- Nigga, if that is so disrespectful,

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:11.314
then why is it okay for me
to call you that?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.479
You're a fucking nigga!

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:19.794
- You're a fucking nigga, Miles!
- Why are we talking about...

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:21.758
You out here acting an ass

01:09:21.840 --> 01:09:24.674
like it ain't no fucking consequences
for that shit.

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.752
And every nigga who sees me
thinks that I do the same

01:09:27.840 --> 01:09:32.392
dumb, fuckin' ignorant,
gun-carrying shit that you do!

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.639
But I've been taking care of my shit!

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:39.470
I fucking... Don't I do
our timecards every week?

01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.076
I pick us up. I keep you out of dumb shit,

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.799
and then what do you do?

01:09:45.439 --> 01:09:48.796
You go out and you buy
a fucking gun for what?

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.033
For your family?

01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:55.760
You are the nigger
that they are out here looking for!

01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:24.879
Well, then, fuck you then!

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:29.715
You hear that?

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.274
Then, fuck you then!

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.476
You better not have
no fuckin' gun on you, 'cause...

- Ow, the shit's broken!
- Shut up!

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.696
I got into a fucking fight!
The fuck you want me to do about it, huh?

01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.120
You wanna fight about the shit too?

01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:08.197
You're picking the wrong fights,
all right?

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:10.994
This is already hard. This is work.

01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:13.616
He is work, and I don't feel like
you are here with me right now!

01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:15.600
I didn't buy that gun
on no tough shit, all right?

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.149
I know why you thought
you needed to buy a gun!

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.955
Just let me ask you something.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.994
Were you afraid

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.752
when you came out here

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.351
and saw Sean holding a gun?

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:43.760
Yes.

01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:46.750
And do you think

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:52.235
if you would have possibly told me
about buying a gun

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.471
that I might have seen
the scenario coming?

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:04.279
I'm sorry. I didn't...

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
I'm sorry.

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.920
Well, maybe if you niggas
weren't so wild all the fuckin' time.

01:14:21.440 --> 01:14:22.840
Could you not call me that?

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.956
What, "nigga"?

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.032
Yeah, can you not call me that, please?

01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:33.710
Okay.

[cell phone vibrating]

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.000
Hi.

01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:11.120
Hi.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.876
Um...

01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:17.954
How's the...

01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:19.599
How's the memorizing coming?

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:22.790
Yeah, just trying
to learn these psych terms.

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.557

for the double picture one?

Oh, I like that one.

01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.158
It was "blindspotting."

01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:36.993
Why "blindspotting"?

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.311
'Cause it's all about
how you can look at something,

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:42.598
and there can be another thing there
that you aren't seeing.

01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:44.034
So you got a blind spot.

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:49.756
But if somebody points out
the other picture to you,

01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.991
doesn't that make it
not a blind spot anymore?

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:57.277
No, 'cause you can't go against
what your brain wants to see first.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:00.080
Unless you spend the time to
retrain your brain, which is hella hard,

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.920
so you're always gonna
be instinctually blind

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.559
to the spot you weren't seeing.

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.000

01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.477
