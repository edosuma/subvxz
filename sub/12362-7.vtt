23:58.438 --> 24:02.147
NOW, JULIA, YOU NEED TO
START TELLING ME THE TRUTH,

24:02.358 --> 24:04.610
OR I'M GONNA START THINKING YOU
WERE BEHIND THIS WHOLE THING,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.980
LOOKING FOR A SHORTCUT
OUT OF YOUR MARRIAGE.

24:07.196 --> 24:09.812
SHERIFF LONGMIRE,
I DIDN'T TRY TO KILL MY HUSBAND.

24:10.033 --> 24:12.740
I MAY HAVE BEEN LOOKING
FOR SOME PASSION IN MY LIFE,

24:12.952 --> 24:14.328
BUT I CARE ABOUT CHRIS,

24:14.537 --> 24:16.573
AND I WANT WHOEVER DID THIS
BROUGHT TO JUSTICE.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.917
I KNOW YOU MAY NOT LIKE
WHAT I'VE DONE --

I'M NOT PERFECT --
BUT I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.

24:22.545 --> 24:24.501
WELL, KEEP GOING, THEN.
WHAT ABOUT THE CUSTER PAINTING?

24:24.714 --> 24:26.875
WE BOUGHT IT
ON THE BLACK MARKET.

24:27.091 --> 24:29.127
I KNOW IT'S ILLEGAL,
BUT...

24:29.344 --> 24:30.754
IT WAS PERFECT FOR US.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.471
HOW MUCH
IS THE PAINTING WORTH?

24:32.680 --> 24:37.265
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN $300,000
AND $400,000.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.681
I SIGHS 1
THAT MUCH?

24:44.901 --> 24:47.358
YOU THINK LEVI KNEW
HOW MUCH THE PAINTING WAS WORTH?

24:47.570 --> 24:49.982
IT WAS WORTH SOMETHING.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.905
IT'S THE SAME BASIC SIZE
AND SHAPE.

24:53.117 --> 24:55.449
LOOKS LIKE
A DURANGO HEEL, TOO.

YOU THINK THEY SELL HERE

25:05.296 --> 25:07.287

A LOT.

25:07.507 --> 25:08.872

OUT LEVI, EITHER, SO...

25:11.511 --> 25:13.968
WHAT ABOUT THAT BELT BUCKLE
THAT YOU FOUND?

25:16.057 --> 25:18.673
WELL,
ACCORDING TO JULIA,

25:18.893 --> 25:21.430

BELONGED TO CHRIS.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.021
WHEN HE WAKES UP
AND FINDS OUT

25:33.241 --> 25:41.455
THAT HIS WIFE WAS CHEATING
ON HIM WITH BARLOW CONNALLY.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.952
I DON'T KNOW HOW PEOPLE
LIVE WITH THEMSELVES.

25:46.254 --> 25:48.461
CHEATERS HAVE A WAY
OF RATIONALIZING WHAT THEY DO.

YOU MARRIED THE WRONG PERSON.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.349

QUESTIONS I NEED TO ASK YOU.

27:42.453 --> 27:44.865

FROM YOUR HOUSE,

WITHIN AN INCH OF HIS LIFE
LAST FRIDAY NIGHT.

35:49.189 --> 35:52.522

THAT'S MURDER.

WHAT THE HELL
THIS IS REALLY ABOUT?

36:08.292 --> 36:10.032
BETWEEN $300,000
AND $400,000,

36:10.252 --> 36:12.629
WHICH BEGS THE QUESTION,
WHY WOULD ONE OF YOU

36:12.838 --> 36:15.295
HAVE JUST DROPPED IT IN THE BACK
OF A STRANGER'S PICKUP TRUCK?

36:17.426 --> 36:19.712

WE STOLE THIS PAINTING.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.699
I MEAN,
MAYBE HE DOESN'T,

36:51.919 --> 36:54.001
BUT HE WAS NOT
AT THE SUBLETTES' HOUSE.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.373
I'M SORRY,
DENNIS, BUT...

36:58.592 --> 37:00.207
WELL, I WAS WORRIED

37:00.427 --> 37:01.507
THAT DENNIS WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH JULIA SUBLETTE.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.006
HONEY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

37:04.223 --> 37:06.088

HOUSE AND TENDING
TO THE ANIMALS.

REAL CLOSE...LATELY.

SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.476
YOU GO TO THE SUBLETTE HOUSE,
LANGLEY?

37:18.612 --> 37:21.445
I ASKED ZAC
TO FOLLOW HIM.

37:28.956 --> 37:31.538
DID YOU
FOLLOW HIM, ZAC?
YES.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.251
BUT IT'S ALL
GONNA BE OK.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.542
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING
TO TELL YOU.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.040
ZAC FOLLOWED HIM
TO THE SUBLETTES' HOUSE,

37:38.257 --> 37:40.464
BUT HE TOLD ME THAT
HE WAS NOT HAVING AN AFFAIR

37:40.676 --> 37:42.587
WITH JULIA SUBLETTE.

37:42.803 --> 37:46.045
SO, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO CHRIS SUBLETTE,

37:46.265 --> 37:49.849
BUT NEITHER ZAC OR DENNIS

37:50.060 --> 37:53.268
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

SAME SIZE, ZAC.

ARE YOU CRAZY?
GET YOUR HANDS OFF HIM!

THAT PUT CHRIS INTO A COMA?

WE'RE GONNA CALL A LAWYER!

WHAT'S GOING ON, SON?

38:03.699 --> 38:06.907
WERE YOU THERE THAT NIGHT?
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

38:08.787 --> 38:10.163

38:16.295 --> 38:18.160
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE
RIGHT NOW.

SCREWING JULIA SUBLETTE.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.544
YOU WERE SCREWING HER HUSBAND.

ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:26.764 --> 38:28.629

PUT YOU UP TO THIS?

38:28.849 --> 38:31.181

AT THE SUBLETTES'.

I JUST GOT SO PISSED.

38:35.731 --> 38:39.474

I GOT THE HOT SHOT,

38:51.163 --> 38:55.076
AND THEN I -- I-I WAITED.

38:55.292 --> 38:59.501
AND THEN WHEN MY DAD LEFT,
I WENT TO THE HOUSE,

38:59.713 --> 39:03.046
RANG THE DOORBELL,
AND MR. SUBLETTE ANSWERED.

39:03.258 --> 39:05.635
HE SAID SOMETHING TO ME.

39:05.844 --> 39:07.380
HE CALLED ME...

39:07.596 --> 39:09.552
HE CALLED ME "SON."

I FLIPPED OUT.

39:14.645 --> 39:16.351

39:16.563 --> 39:18.144
HE HIT THE SECURITY ALARM,
AND THE ALARM WENT OFF,

39:18.357 --> 39:20.063
BUT I HAD THE HOT SHOT,

39:20.275 --> 39:24.314
AND IT JUST TOOK HIM RIGHT DOWN.

I STARTED KICKING HIM...

39:27.825 --> 39:28.814

UNTIL HE JUST...
STOPPED MOVING.

YOU AND CHRIS SUBLETTE TRUE?

WAS DRUNK AT A CRIME SCENE.

40:58.373 --> 41:01.365
NOW, DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S THE KIND OF INFORMATION

41:01.585 --> 41:03.576

DESERVES TO KNOW?

41:03.795 --> 41:05.296

41:05.505 --> 41:07.632
HE DIDN'T
GET BEHIND THE WHEEL,

41:07.841 --> 41:10.799

HELPED SAVE CHRIS' LIFE,
