WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:03.840
Tracy, Jenna.

00:03.878 --> 00:05.124
We all know what happen

00:05.125 --> 00:07.457
when you hosted
the St. Patrick's day parade

00:07.458 --> 00:08.393
three years ago.

00:10.122 --> 00:11.256
Wake up,
mother-.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.008
And when you hosted
two years ago.

00:13.042 --> 00:14.542
Die, demon!

00:14.593 --> 00:16.327
Why didn't you
ever call me back?

00:16.344 --> 00:18.563
Unfortunately,
unless <i>Harry's law</i>

00:18.597 --> 00:20.048
really took off this week
and no one told me,

00:20.082 --> 00:22.550
you two are the biggest stars
at the network.

00:22.601 --> 00:24.552
But this year,
everything you say

00:24.603 --> 00:26.337
will be scripted
and on prompter.

00:26.355 --> 00:28.974
Do not deviate
from the script.

00:29.008 --> 00:30.809
Jack, Tracy and I
are total pros.

00:30.843 --> 00:32.060
On television,

00:32.110 --> 00:34.195
and when it comes to
the assisted suicide debate.

00:34.230 --> 00:38.700
Secret handshake,
my baloney.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.285
Hazel,
I won't be here tomorrow,

00:40.319 --> 00:43.154
so... I wanted
to give you this.

00:43.188 --> 00:45.040
It's the tail I had
until I was 16.

00:45.074 --> 00:47.742
Well, don't worry
about the parade.

00:47.793 --> 00:49.160
I'll take care
of Tracy and Jenna

00:49.194 --> 00:51.046
like they're
my own children.

00:51.080 --> 00:52.213
Which is a bad example,

00:52.248 --> 00:56.301
because I left my kids
at a sears in 2004.

00:56.335 --> 00:58.870
I told you about
Mr. Jordan's allergies, right?

00:58.888 --> 01:00.088
Yes, Kenneth.

01:00.139 --> 01:01.556
He's only allergic
to allergy medication.

01:01.590 --> 01:04.208
But he loves it.
And Ms. Mulroney's...

01:04.226 --> 01:06.544
Kenneth, let go.
This is my rodeo now.

01:06.562 --> 01:09.064
Well, not literally,
of course.

01:09.098 --> 01:12.383
The U.S. Rodeo Association
does not lift lifetime bans.

01:15.104 --> 01:17.856
So are you gonna work
through St. Patrick's day?

01:17.890 --> 01:20.275
Don't you want to celebrate
Ireland's great accomplishments,

01:20.326 --> 01:23.361
like Michael Lohan
and vomiting into a bagpipe?

01:23.395 --> 01:24.529
Lemon,
so I take it

01:24.563 --> 01:25.914
you will not be
wearing green tomorrow.

01:25.948 --> 01:27.615
I will be wearing
head-to-toe orange,

01:27.666 --> 01:29.918
in honor of protestant
William of Orange,

01:29.952 --> 01:33.104
inventor of the Orange,
according to Yahoo answers.

01:33.139 --> 01:35.206
You in Orange?

01:35.240 --> 01:36.624
You'll look
like a creamsicle

01:36.675 --> 01:37.842
with an old tooth
stuck in it.

01:37.877 --> 01:39.377
Well,
you'll never see me,

01:39.411 --> 01:41.346
'cause I don't leave my house
on St. Patrick's day.

01:41.380 --> 01:43.932
Criss and I are going
to ride out hurricane shamrock

01:43.966 --> 01:46.250
holed up in my apartment,

01:46.268 --> 01:48.586
laughing at excerpts
from <i>Angela's ashes.</i>

01:48.604 --> 01:50.555
You know, some people might
find your attitude offensive.

01:50.589 --> 01:51.606
What are they
going to do about it,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.058
write a meandering play

01:53.092 --> 01:56.644
about how amazing the Irish are
at not overcoming adversity?

01:56.695 --> 01:57.762
Well, I'm sorry
we can't all belong

01:57.780 --> 01:59.764
to ethnic groups
as beloved as the Germans.

01:59.782 --> 02:01.316
Please,
without Germans,

02:01.367 --> 02:02.951
you wouldn't have any
of the <i>Indiana Jones</i> movies.

02:02.985 --> 02:05.487
Lemon, your secret love
of the Irish is well-documented.

02:05.538 --> 02:06.821
After all,
I am your mentor,

02:06.872 --> 02:08.406
you dated Dennis Duffy,

02:08.440 --> 02:10.274
and in the '90s,
you gave money to the IRA.

02:10.292 --> 02:12.293
I thought it was contributing
to a retirement account.

02:12.328 --> 02:13.945
You know, I think
someone needs to learn

02:13.963 --> 02:16.014
a St. Patrick's day lesson.

02:19.552 --> 02:22.153
What is that?
A curse?

02:22.188 --> 02:23.354
Take it back,
you witch!

Get out of my studio!</i>

02:52.985 --> 02:55.120

02:56.906 --> 02:59.290
<i>Didn't you hear
my show on bullying?</i>

02:59.325 --> 03:01.025
Criss,
watch this.

03:02.194 --> 03:04.879
Megan!
Megan!

03:06.332 --> 03:08.633
Look at them spin around.
They're so confused.

03:08.667 --> 03:10.502
- Awesome.
- It's too many Megans, right?

03:10.536 --> 03:11.669
I love you.

03:13.139 --> 03:14.923
I just ordered thai food.
How much do you love me now?

03:16.058 --> 03:17.475
Man, they're fast.

03:17.510 --> 03:19.761
You know what, I can't wait
till the asians take over.

03:19.812 --> 03:21.879
Thank God for delivery,
keeping us inside

03:21.897 --> 03:24.315
and safe from
all the Irish nonsense.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.316
Dummy.

03:25.351 --> 03:27.552
The curse.

03:27.570 --> 03:29.254
What's up?
I'm Dennis,

03:29.288 --> 03:32.407
a former lover of Liz's....

03:32.441 --> 03:34.492
I tried to steal beer
from a Duane reade,

03:34.527 --> 03:36.578
and some black guy
cold-cocked me.

03:36.612 --> 03:37.579
Like a security guard?

03:37.613 --> 03:38.863
I don't know, pal.

03:38.897 --> 03:42.951
I don't see people
that way.

03:44.370 --> 03:45.837
No, no.
No.

03:45.871 --> 03:48.573
Before we go on,

03:48.591 --> 03:50.375
- do you want to pray together?
- Yeah.

03:50.409 --> 03:52.877
- Michael Jackson's ghost...
- Great Kabbalah monster...

03:52.911 --> 03:55.380
<i>NBC is showing the promo
I worked on for the parade!</i>

03:55.414 --> 03:56.548
I'm famous.

03:56.582 --> 03:59.384
<i>And now back to
NBC's live coverage</i>

03:59.418 --> 04:01.119
<i>of the 2012
St. Patrick's day parade,</i>

04:01.153 --> 04:03.321
<i>with hosts Jenna Maroney
and Tracy Jordan.</i>

04:03.355 --> 04:07.609
My God!
They said my name first.

04:07.643 --> 04:09.027
But I'm more famous
than you.

04:09.061 --> 04:13.147
This is probably
some Hollywood prank,

04:13.199 --> 04:14.816
like on the set
<i>ocean's 12,</i>

04:14.867 --> 04:17.035
when I put that snake
in George Clooney's bed.

04:17.069 --> 04:18.620
I was not in the movie.

04:18.654 --> 04:20.538
Or maybe now that
<i>Kidz</i> is a giant hit,

04:20.572 --> 04:22.323
I'm the one
America wants to see.

04:22.374 --> 04:23.658
You better not be
talking about

04:23.709 --> 04:25.210
my dear friend,
America Ferrera.

04:25.244 --> 04:26.744
Get your stuff
out of here,

04:26.778 --> 04:28.463
'cause I get
the bigger dressing room now.

04:28.497 --> 04:29.914
I'll replace your lizard

04:29.948 --> 04:32.417
with a gay guy
in a giant champagne bottle.

04:32.451 --> 04:33.751
Siri, kill Jenna!

04:33.785 --> 04:35.720
what's going on?

04:35.754 --> 04:37.755
I get second billing
to this small-boobied grandma?

04:37.789 --> 04:40.925
No, you guys are friends,
remember? "My baloney"?

04:40.959 --> 04:43.428
The only baloney Tracy has
is the baloney he's full of.

04:43.462 --> 04:45.313
Why would you say that?

04:45.347 --> 04:46.898
You can't take that back.

04:48.133 --> 04:51.102
<i>I killed Jenna elfman.
Is that right?</i>

04:51.136 --> 04:52.403
Did you show them
the promo?

04:52.438 --> 04:55.523
Hazel, we don't let them
watch NBC.

04:55.574 --> 04:56.941
Jenna thinks
that Christina Aguilera

04:56.975 --> 04:58.309
lost her voice
during childbirth,

04:58.327 --> 04:59.577
and Tracy doesn't
need to know

04:59.612 --> 05:00.978
that he just became
number two around here.

05:00.996 --> 05:02.830
That kind of mistake
can ruin everything.

05:02.865 --> 05:05.483
I don't like
the way you're talking to me.

05:05.501 --> 05:09.504
Why don't we drive to Sears?
I'll buy you a toy.

05:14.627 --> 05:16.928
Excuse me.
May I help you?

05:16.962 --> 05:18.680
What? We don't use your
bathroom when you're not here.

05:18.714 --> 05:20.331
I'm Lutz.

05:20.349 --> 05:22.183
Frank, first of all,

05:22.217 --> 05:24.052
what are you doing here
on a Saturday?

05:24.103 --> 05:26.287
None of the writers can
go out on St. Patrick's day

05:26.322 --> 05:29.107
because we all have faces people
naturally just want to punch.

05:29.141 --> 05:30.725
So we're all
hiding out here,

05:30.776 --> 05:32.777
playing
<i>Colonizers of Malaar.</i>

05:32.811 --> 05:34.228
It's a strategy board game

05:34.280 --> 05:36.447
from the makers <i>Goblet quest</i>
<i>and virginity keep.</i>

05:36.482 --> 05:38.366
In Malaar,
you build a kingdom

05:38.400 --> 05:40.451
and battle
for world domination.

05:40.486 --> 05:43.404
Right now, I'm just
the Lord of the Karthian plains,

05:43.455 --> 05:45.073
but that means
I control all the wheat!

05:45.124 --> 05:48.793
It's actually interesting.

05:48.827 --> 05:50.878
You have
a monopoly on wheat.

05:50.913 --> 05:53.748
But what happens if you
overproduce, flood the markets?

05:53.799 --> 05:55.083
Prices drop,
your economy collapses.

05:55.134 --> 05:56.718
You've got
to diversify, Frank.

05:56.752 --> 05:58.469
It's basic capitalism.

05:58.504 --> 06:00.004
What other resources
do you have?

06:00.038 --> 06:01.673
Unicorns?

06:01.707 --> 06:03.308
Can you breed
and sell them?

06:03.342 --> 06:04.892
There's got to be
a market for unicorns.

06:04.927 --> 06:08.396
If I've learned anything from
reading Liddy's princess books,

06:08.430 --> 06:10.598
unicorn hair
has magical properties.

06:10.649 --> 06:11.649
You've got to know
your product, Frank.

06:11.684 --> 06:13.267
That's awesome.

06:13.319 --> 06:14.569
It's nothing.

06:14.603 --> 06:16.404
That kind of thinking
is what I do for a living.

06:16.438 --> 06:18.756
At least, I used to.

06:18.791 --> 06:20.558
You just have
to replace "Malaar"

06:20.576 --> 06:22.443
with "Fairfield, Connecticut,"

06:22.478 --> 06:25.563
and "unicorn" with...

06:25.597 --> 06:30.251
Unicorn,"
a death Ray.

06:30.285 --> 06:33.955
Hot dog truck,
I went entrepreneur, too.

06:34.006 --> 06:35.373
I got this new business

06:35.407 --> 06:37.508
where I burn your old DVDs
onto laserdisc.

06:37.543 --> 06:39.210
Dennis,

06:39.244 --> 06:41.012
I don't think you should
be drinking with a head injury.

06:42.214 --> 06:43.965
That's a good Liz impression,
Criss.

06:44.016 --> 06:46.134
She's a bummer.

06:46.185 --> 06:47.769
Well, 911
is still busy.

06:47.803 --> 06:50.688
What could be causing so many
medical emergencies today?

06:50.723 --> 06:52.690
Right,
an Irish religious festival.

06:52.725 --> 06:54.359
Irish pride!
Go, Celtics!

06:54.393 --> 06:55.860
Celtics suck.
Go, Knicks!

06:55.894 --> 06:57.595
As soon as I get through,
I'm getting you an ambulance,

06:57.613 --> 06:59.313
and you are
out of here, Dennis.

06:59.365 --> 07:00.782
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't get into an ambulance.

07:00.816 --> 07:02.817
I don't have health insurance
because of Obama.

07:02.868 --> 07:04.986
Look, Liz, I don't think
he needs to go to the hospital

07:05.037 --> 07:06.821
for a concussion.
I was a volunteer EMT.

07:06.872 --> 07:08.956
At burning man, and we agreed
never to talk about that.

07:08.991 --> 07:10.742
At sunset,
the CACTI start to resemble

07:10.776 --> 07:12.160
people looking for hugs.

07:12.211 --> 07:13.628
It gets ugly, Liz.

07:13.662 --> 07:15.913
You know, there's some things
I miss about being with you,

07:15.947 --> 07:17.965
like having somewhere
to hook my SEGA up to,

07:18.000 --> 07:19.133
but this constant judgment...

07:19.168 --> 07:21.252
Criss deserves better.

07:21.286 --> 07:22.754
Criss, may I speak to you
alone for a minute?

07:22.788 --> 07:25.423
No. Anything you need
to say to him,

07:25.457 --> 07:26.591
you can say
in front of me.

07:26.625 --> 07:28.309
Me and Criss...

07:28.343 --> 07:30.912
We're bang brothers....

07:36.080 --> 07:38.381
God, live TV's such a rush.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.966
It's like sex,

07:40.001 --> 07:42.636
but your husband isn't looking
at a picture of a bridge.

07:42.670 --> 07:46.089
Peter, can you
explain this to me?

07:46.123 --> 07:48.225
Well, obviously
I'm host number one.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.576
We all saw the promo.

07:49.610 --> 07:52.729
Hazel, the script had
Tracy and Jenna's names in it.

07:52.763 --> 07:53.713
Did you change that?

07:53.748 --> 07:54.931
Duh!

07:54.965 --> 07:57.100
After you PMS-ed
about their names yesterday,

07:57.134 --> 07:59.269
I thought numbers
would make everyone happy.

07:59.303 --> 08:02.839
We're on in five,
four, three...

08:02.874 --> 08:07.444
Welcome to the 2012
St. Patrick's day parade on NBC.

08:07.478 --> 08:09.779
They're both reading
host number one.

08:09.813 --> 08:10.864
Would a third host help?

08:10.915 --> 08:12.449
I am S.A.G. eligible,

08:12.483 --> 08:15.368
but I will only do nude stuff
if there's a mirror behind me.

08:15.419 --> 08:17.087
Forget the parade, Hazel!

08:17.121 --> 08:18.872
For six years,
we've been tricking them

08:18.923 --> 08:20.457
into thinking
they're friends,

08:20.491 --> 08:21.958
and you've undone
all that in a day.

08:21.992 --> 08:23.793
I understand you have
some interesting trivia

08:23.827 --> 08:25.896
about this year's parade.

08:25.930 --> 08:30.050
No way,
that's amazing!

08:32.219 --> 08:34.971
No.
I've moved on.

08:35.005 --> 08:38.006
I couldn't agree more.

08:42.947 --> 08:44.063
I'm playing
two timber

08:44.115 --> 08:45.565
and one brick
to build a bridge

08:45.616 --> 08:48.702
and establish
a trading post in Midgar.

08:49.904 --> 08:50.870
That failed...

08:50.905 --> 08:53.840
And the Orcs
raped everybody.

08:53.874 --> 08:57.744
Okay, and I am offering Frank
500 gold coins

08:57.795 --> 08:59.629
for the neutral land
between the Elf kingdoms.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.665
- I'll double it.
- The price is now 3000.

09:01.699 --> 09:03.300
- I'll mortgage Theowyn castle.
- I'll take out a loan.

09:03.334 --> 09:05.085
Don't you see
what you're doing?

09:05.136 --> 09:06.419
You're creating
a real estate bubble,

09:06.470 --> 09:08.221
and the only person
who'll benefit is sue,

09:08.255 --> 09:09.723
who'll buy up
all the neutral land

09:09.757 --> 09:11.091
for cents on the dollar.

09:11.142 --> 09:12.392
Thanks a lot, Klootzak.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.810
I don't come to where you work
and slap the...

09:13.844 --> 09:16.346
It's basic macroeconomics,
people.

09:16.380 --> 09:18.231
None of you is fit
to be king of Malaar.

09:18.265 --> 09:21.851
And you would presume to wield
the scepter of Thalbain?

09:21.885 --> 09:24.104
Yes.

09:24.155 --> 09:27.991
Yes, I would.

09:28.025 --> 09:29.159
Why are you
being nice to him?

09:29.193 --> 09:30.560
What, you want me
to be jealous?

09:30.578 --> 09:32.996
I'm not that guy.
I'm this guy.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.164
No, you need
to know something.

09:34.198 --> 09:35.565
Dennis Duffy is
like the Terminator

09:35.583 --> 09:37.233
with cheaper sunglasses.

09:37.251 --> 09:38.668
He just keeps
coming back,

09:38.703 --> 09:41.087
because his potato brain thinks
he still has a chance with me.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.423
Liz, you'll be back.

09:43.457 --> 09:45.008
If I ever see you again,
I'll kill you.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.242
You'll be back.

09:46.260 --> 09:48.044
- Never again!
- You'll be back, Liz Lemon.

09:48.079 --> 09:49.546
You'll be back.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.414
I'm not kicking Dennis out
of here in his condition.

09:51.449 --> 09:53.099
Guy with a concussion
on St. Patrick's day

09:53.134 --> 09:54.434
is like a horse
with a broken leg.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.720
Exactly.
We should shoot him.

09:56.754 --> 09:57.937
Don't you see
what he's doing?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.140
He's already driving
a wedge between us.

10:00.191 --> 10:03.643
Criss, get in here.
There's a lez movie on showtime.

10:21.045 --> 10:22.412
Three again?

10:22.446 --> 10:26.399
And your yak...
Has smallpox.

10:26.434 --> 10:27.834
Rockefeller, no!

10:29.119 --> 10:30.236
What?

10:30.271 --> 10:31.971
Dennis is here.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.357
Take back your curse.
This isn't funny anymore.

10:34.392 --> 10:36.009
Really?
You're cursed?

10:36.060 --> 10:37.961
Try ruling over
the desert wastelands of Kroth

10:37.995 --> 10:39.512
with no spell cards.

10:39.563 --> 10:42.482
Are you playing <i>Volonizers</i>
<i>of Lamar</i> with the writers?

10:42.516 --> 10:45.568
<i>Malaar,</i> and this game
is just dumb luck.

10:45.603 --> 10:48.021
I dug all these trenches
to irrigate the desert...

10:48.072 --> 10:50.190
But no one's playing
his rain ca...

10:52.243 --> 10:54.911
I'm trapped
in a barren wasteland,

10:54.945 --> 10:57.414
and no matter what I do,
I can't get out.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.415
Wait.

10:59.834 --> 11:02.502
My God,
it's happening again.

11:02.536 --> 11:05.422
The desert of Kroth
is Kabletown.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.540
I've got
to get some fresh air.

11:07.591 --> 11:09.759
So fine,
two can play at this game.

11:09.794 --> 11:12.462
I'm putting
an old German curse on you.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.136
- Dennis had a great idea.
- No.

11:20.170 --> 11:21.805
I should take the hot dog
truck out after the parade,

11:21.839 --> 11:23.523
and sell empty buns
to drunk people.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.892
My God, Criss,
he's just trying to get me alone

11:25.943 --> 11:29.062
so he can start a gas leak
or claim squatter's rights

11:29.096 --> 11:30.396
or hit me over the head,

11:30.448 --> 11:32.615
and when I wake up,
we're on our honeymoon.

11:32.650 --> 11:33.983
At seaworld.

11:34.017 --> 11:35.618
Are you sure
this is Dennis's obsession?

11:35.653 --> 11:38.204
'Cause you're the one who can't
seem to stop talking about him.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.790
Are you kidding?
I know Dennis Duffy's brain.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.859
I saw some of it
when he jumped on the ice

11:42.877 --> 11:43.960
during an islanders game.

11:43.994 --> 11:45.378
His next move
will be

11:45.412 --> 11:50.216
mentioning some fake girlfriend
to try to make me jealous...

11:50.251 --> 11:52.802
But I'm going to turn it
against him.

11:52.837 --> 11:57.257
And once again, the puppet
will become the puppet master.

11:57.308 --> 11:58.424
What does that mean,
"once again"?

11:58.476 --> 12:00.510
That's not a thing.

12:00.544 --> 12:04.547
This ends right now.

12:06.117 --> 12:08.234
Dude, you missed
the end of the lez movie.

12:08.269 --> 12:10.270
Their daughter,
she goes off to college,

12:10.321 --> 12:12.105
and Mark Ruffalo,
he's just gonna do

12:12.156 --> 12:13.439
his own thing
with the restaurant.

12:13.491 --> 12:15.325
Look, is there anyone
you want us to call

12:15.359 --> 12:16.993
to let them know
you're okay?

12:17.027 --> 12:18.912
I left a message
for Megan earlier,

12:18.946 --> 12:19.929
but it's hard for her
to answer her phone,

12:19.964 --> 12:21.498
'cause her boobs
are so big.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.666
I'm sorry,
and who's Megan?

12:23.701 --> 12:25.502
She's my lady, Liz.
I'm seeing someone.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.453
She's a card girl
at kangaroo boxing matches,

12:27.505 --> 12:30.673
so she's got a body,
and she's loaded.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.709
Her grandfather
invented the stop sign.

12:32.743 --> 12:34.711
Wait, are you saying
you're over me?

12:34.745 --> 12:36.462
Elizabeth,
don't do this.

12:36.514 --> 12:38.715
Because I am not over you.

12:38.749 --> 12:40.216
I never will be!

12:40.250 --> 12:43.520
I love you, Dennis.
I love you so much...

12:43.554 --> 12:45.138
What the hell, Liz?

12:45.189 --> 12:47.390
No, Criss,
I'm just proving my point.

12:47.424 --> 12:48.975
I don't care
what you're doing.

12:49.009 --> 12:50.527
So it turns out
you <i>can't</i> say "I love you,"

12:50.561 --> 12:52.779
- just not to me.
- Wait, what?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.230
It's not like you haven't
had the chance to say it.

12:54.264 --> 12:57.066
- Love you.
- You're the best.

12:57.100 --> 12:59.452
- Love you.
- Scooby-doo.

12:59.486 --> 13:01.704
- I love you.
- I just ordered thai food.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.907
And I thought you were
just emotionally infantile.

13:03.941 --> 13:06.543
I am!
Me baby.

13:06.577 --> 13:07.994
Yeah.
I'm gonna take the truck out.

13:08.045 --> 13:11.247
No, it's happening.
The wedge!

13:12.833 --> 13:15.301
Liz, we need to talk.

13:15.336 --> 13:18.004
Open the bag of wine.

13:18.055 --> 13:19.956
<i>And we're back
with our live coverage</i>

13:19.974 --> 13:21.591
<i>of the St. Patrick's day
parade.</i>

13:21.625 --> 13:24.844
<i>I'm Al Roker, taking over for
Jenna Maroney and Tracy Jordan.</i>

13:24.879 --> 13:27.129
He should have said
my name first.

13:27.147 --> 13:28.731
Roker should be
on my side.

13:28.766 --> 13:31.351
Why, because you both have
had huge weight fluctuations?

13:37.057 --> 13:38.641
What?

13:38.659 --> 13:41.661
Okay, that's not how you're
supposed to answer the phone.

13:41.695 --> 13:42.745
Just thought I'd check in.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.581
Everything's fine.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.583
Pete says
I'm doing great.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.418
I'm not about
to screw this up, Kenneth,

13:48.452 --> 13:50.336
'cause I'd get kicked out
of show business,

13:50.371 --> 13:51.921
and then
how would I be famous?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.006
By starting a fire

13:53.040 --> 13:54.457
and then rescuing everyone
from it?

13:54.491 --> 13:57.210
And then I'm a hero
and then I'm <i>Playboy?</i>

13:57.261 --> 13:58.945
Hazel, are Mr. Jordan
and Ms. Maroney fighting?

13:58.979 --> 14:01.180
Well, you're not a page
anymore, Kenneth.

14:01.215 --> 14:04.584
That information
is classified.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.940
You look troubled, son.

14:10.975 --> 14:13.326
Would you like
to talk about it?

14:13.360 --> 14:14.727
I'm stuck, father.

14:14.778 --> 14:18.214
Stuck in a company
that won't innovate or change.

14:18.249 --> 14:21.034
I feel helpless.
Impotent.

14:21.068 --> 14:23.453
Buy me a drink first.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.905
Sorry, we've been instructed
to keep it light.

14:27.491 --> 14:29.659
Now there's a man
who overcame some difficulties.

14:29.693 --> 14:31.878
I'm sure you know
the story of St. Patrick,

14:31.912 --> 14:33.296
driving the snakes
out of Ireland.

14:33.330 --> 14:35.031
I'm going to have to stop you
right there, father,

14:35.049 --> 14:36.198
'cause I know for a fact

14:36.216 --> 14:38.034
that there were
never any snakes in Ireland,

14:38.052 --> 14:40.169
and St. Patrick didn't drive
anything out of anywhere.

14:40.203 --> 14:42.255
Knock, knock.

14:42.306 --> 14:44.807
First of all, he was born
in fourth century Ireland.

14:44.842 --> 14:47.143
He might as well have been
born in a grave.

14:47.177 --> 14:50.596
His only worldly possession
was no snakes.

14:50.648 --> 14:53.099
But he turned that...

14:53.150 --> 14:56.636
Into sainthood,
a holiday,

14:56.670 --> 14:59.622
this magnificent cathedral.

14:59.657 --> 15:01.341
He was just some guy

15:01.375 --> 15:04.694
starving in the wilderness...

15:04.728 --> 15:06.395
Exactly like me.

15:06.413 --> 15:10.333
But he found a way
to change his luck,

15:10.367 --> 15:15.722
to take nothing
and turn it into...

15:15.756 --> 15:18.624
By the scepter of Thalbain.

15:20.925 --> 15:22.325
Out!
Now!

15:25.652 --> 15:27.269
Look, Liz, there's something
I've got to tell you.

15:27.304 --> 15:29.238
- Not interested.
- Megan isn't my girlfriend.

15:29.272 --> 15:31.006
I know,
and I am not letting you...

15:31.041 --> 15:31.991
She's my wife.

15:32.025 --> 15:34.309
We just got back
from Seaworld yesterday,

15:34.327 --> 15:35.911
and I know this is
hard for you to hear...

15:35.946 --> 15:38.697
Yeah, it's so hard for me
to hear about your "wife."

15:38.748 --> 15:39.698
I'm so jealous.

15:39.749 --> 15:40.916
Dennis, baby!

15:40.951 --> 15:42.034
I would have
got here sooner,

15:42.085 --> 15:44.954
but I passed out
laughing on 69th Street.

15:44.988 --> 15:47.623
That's hilarious, Megs.
What's up, sugar?

15:47.657 --> 15:48.707
- Hi, how are you?
- How are you doing?

15:48.758 --> 15:50.626
Wait a minute,
Megan is real?

15:50.660 --> 15:53.128
I thought you were
lying to get us back together.

15:53.162 --> 15:54.380
That's why I said
I loved you.

15:54.431 --> 15:55.931
I was trying
to call your bluff.

15:55.966 --> 15:57.433
You know,
that's really messed up, Liz.

15:57.467 --> 15:59.935
Okay, wait,
you said you love him?

15:59.970 --> 16:01.270
Okay.

16:01.304 --> 16:04.607
You got two minutes
to fill a sock with quarters,

16:04.641 --> 16:07.142
and then we go outside.

16:07.176 --> 16:09.311
My God, stop it,
no more of this Irish nonsense.

16:09.345 --> 16:12.114
Dennis, you came in here,
possibly as part of a curse,

16:12.148 --> 16:14.116
and ruined everything!

16:14.150 --> 16:15.701
What? I did nothing.

16:15.735 --> 16:18.204
If anyone's full
of Irish nonsense, it's you.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.538
- Excuse me?
- Think about it.

16:19.573 --> 16:21.457
You're the one
that got all emotional

16:21.491 --> 16:23.075
and made a fool of herself
at a party.

16:23.126 --> 16:24.577
This wasn't a party.

16:24.628 --> 16:25.794
Tell me about it.
It sucked.

16:25.829 --> 16:28.497
Look, you're stubborn,
you hold grudges,

16:28.531 --> 16:30.332
you're emotionally repressed.

16:30.366 --> 16:31.550
She's been living
with this great guy,

16:31.585 --> 16:33.135
and hasn't said
"I love you" yet.

16:33.169 --> 16:35.671
Really?
Not even on a Ferris wheel?

16:35.705 --> 16:37.056
Let's face it, Liz.

16:37.090 --> 16:39.558
You're the most
Irish person here.

16:39.593 --> 16:41.260
Happy St. Patrick's day,
dummy.

16:41.311 --> 16:42.928
Wait, it's St. Patrick's day?

16:42.979 --> 16:47.016
St. Patrick's day, baby.

16:51.321 --> 16:52.821
The first car is here

16:52.856 --> 16:57.743
for whichever one of you
wants to leave first.

16:58.778 --> 17:00.579
Why do I keep
doing this stuff?

17:00.614 --> 17:03.832
Is 70 not a good IQ?

17:10.006 --> 17:11.906
Well, the bigger star
gets the first car.

17:11.925 --> 17:14.792
But the sign says
it's for host number two.

17:14.844 --> 17:16.712
I'm scared, J-mohr.

17:16.746 --> 17:18.097
And not just 'cause
today's the day

17:18.131 --> 17:20.432
that guy that tried
to kill me gets out of jail.

17:20.467 --> 17:23.801
I'm scared 'cause...

17:23.853 --> 17:25.688
What if I'm not
the biggest star anymore?

17:25.722 --> 17:27.640
Tracy,
I know how you feel.

17:27.691 --> 17:29.275
I've felt that way
for the past five years.

17:29.309 --> 17:30.809
And now that I've gotten
everything I wanted,

17:30.860 --> 17:33.896
all I can think about is
how quickly it can all go away.

17:33.930 --> 17:36.365
Tell me about it.
A year ago, I won an Oscar.

17:36.399 --> 17:37.483
Now look at me.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.652
I had to beg to take over
for Andy Rooney.

17:39.703 --> 17:41.403
And it did not go well.

17:41.437 --> 17:42.521
When I was a kid,

17:42.555 --> 17:45.157
you could get
a prostitute for $5.

17:45.208 --> 17:47.242
You know what?

17:47.276 --> 17:48.577
I'll read host number two.

17:48.611 --> 17:51.246
No.
We'll read it together.

17:51.280 --> 17:54.282
Aww.

18:01.174 --> 18:03.926
Know this, Hazel.
I will always be here...

18:03.960 --> 18:05.511
For them and for you.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.012
Nothing can ever make me...

18:07.063 --> 18:08.597
Move your car.

18:16.189 --> 18:18.991
I'd like to spend
my remaining gold...

18:19.025 --> 18:20.359
To purchase a fire spell.

18:20.410 --> 18:23.512
And against whom will you
be casting this spell?

18:23.546 --> 18:25.197
Against myself.

18:25.248 --> 18:27.449
I am setting fire
to my own desert.

18:27.483 --> 18:30.669
- You're insane!
- Am I?

18:30.704 --> 18:32.871
I'm going to turn
my desert into glass,

18:32.906 --> 18:35.457
and glass is a commodity
that you all need,

18:35.491 --> 18:38.260
for your elfin
oracle mirrors,

18:38.294 --> 18:39.678
for your crystal palace,

18:39.713 --> 18:41.013
for the colorful
glass beads

18:41.047 --> 18:43.966
that you keep buying
for some reason.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.285
I'm going to wear them
to the pirates' ball.

18:46.319 --> 18:47.886
You need my glass.

18:47.921 --> 18:49.888
And I'll take your gold...

18:49.923 --> 18:53.892
And eventually,
the throne of 1,000 kings.

18:53.927 --> 18:55.310
You see, it doesn't matter

18:55.344 --> 18:57.446
if I'm on the wind-blown
dunes of Kroth

18:57.480 --> 18:59.181
or in the fluorescent-lit
boardrooms

18:59.215 --> 19:01.150
of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

19:01.184 --> 19:03.535
I will create something

19:03.570 --> 19:06.555
from nothing.

19:06.589 --> 19:11.043
Today Malaar...

19:11.077 --> 19:12.911
Tomorrow Kabletown.

19:19.002 --> 19:23.472
Your highness, you may take
your right as king.

19:23.506 --> 19:27.426
I am a virgin...
with white guys.

19:27.477 --> 19:29.228
All right,
mustard only.

19:29.262 --> 19:31.096
There you go.
Enjoy your bun.

19:31.147 --> 19:33.649
Sorry, sorry.

19:33.683 --> 19:35.317
These are
the only green things I own.

19:35.351 --> 19:38.404
More importantly,
I have never been with someone

19:38.438 --> 19:39.855
for longer than nine months.

19:39.889 --> 19:41.573
You and I have been
together for six,

19:41.608 --> 19:43.275
so I assume something
will go wrong soon.

19:43.326 --> 19:45.527
You'll tell me
you believe in ghosts,

19:45.561 --> 19:48.831
or I'll reveal
that I am terrible

19:48.865 --> 19:51.366
at expressing my feelings.

19:51.400 --> 19:52.751
But it's not
because I don't have them.

19:52.786 --> 19:54.453
It's just because...

19:54.504 --> 19:55.754
I'm used
to being let down.

19:55.789 --> 19:57.339
Wait, is now the time

19:57.373 --> 20:00.008
on St. Patrick's day when
we talk about our feelings?

20:00.043 --> 20:02.511
I don't understand
your art, Kevin.

20:04.848 --> 20:06.932
But this isn't fair
to you, Criss.

20:06.966 --> 20:09.101
This is the happiest
I've been in a long time,

20:09.135 --> 20:12.521
and I'm sorry that I can't
just be a normal person

20:12.555 --> 20:14.356
and tell you stuff.

20:14.390 --> 20:17.592
Like, nice stuff.
Like...

20:17.610 --> 20:19.061
Greeting card stuff.

20:19.095 --> 20:20.312
You're right there,
buddy.

20:20.363 --> 20:22.281
Come on, homestretch.

20:22.315 --> 20:24.650
Come on.

20:24.701 --> 20:26.068
Okay.

20:26.102 --> 20:27.486
I love you.

20:27.537 --> 20:29.621
I know.

20:29.656 --> 20:33.909
You solo-ed me.

20:40.131 --> 20:44.631
Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

20:54.810 --> 20:56.027
Thanks, host number one.

20:56.062 --> 20:58.246
Let's take a look at
what's happening live

20:58.247 --> 20:59.363
in Rockefeller Plaza.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.834
<i>I love you.</i>

21:00.868 --> 21:02.169
I got this!

21:02.203 --> 21:03.537
That is a person named
Liz Lemon

21:03.571 --> 21:05.371
who just told some dude
she loves him.

21:05.393 --> 21:08.593
Well, I have known her for a long time
and she never said that before.

21:08.723 --> 21:11.943
****

21:13.479 --> 21:15.979
Also, TV viewers
liked when in a show is a song.

21:25.056 --> 21:26.347
Don't you dare fade out on me.
