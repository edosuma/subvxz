00:23.501 --> 00:27.471
Abortion is part of a huge
issue on both sides.

00:27.538 --> 00:33.812
Followers of the Lord of Love, How can
we call ourselves Christians, when we are

00:33.878 --> 00:38.917
murdering two million babies,
every single year?!

00:38.983 --> 00:44.322
When you look at an abortion procedure,
there are no arguments, you are

00:44.388 --> 00:46.357
terminating a human life.

00:50.328 --> 00:56.835
Once the sperm and the egg meet, you
now have a developing human being.

00:56.901 --> 01:03.742
I think, women that allow themselves to be
used by men and then go to an abortion clinic

01:03.808 --> 01:05.810
are absolutely insane!

01:05.877 --> 01:14.953
We are warned by Christ's maxim in the
gospel, that those who live by violence will

01:15.019 --> 01:18.222
perish by violence!

01:18.289 --> 01:20.291
[explosion]

01:21.459 --> 01:23.427
[screaming]

01:23.494 --> 01:29.968
Where is the mentality? They've been seduced
by Satan, into this mentality of killing

01:30.034 --> 01:35.807
our children first of all, then killing
our handicapped and our old people.

01:35.874 --> 01:41.545
You wonder, why Christian fathers get
angry, you wonder why we get upset!

01:41.612 --> 01:48.953
We've got to make sure, we keep
abortion safe and legal for women!

01:49.020 --> 01:54.859
At around 10am on December thirtieth, a Friday
morning, I was in pre-term, in the stock

01:54.926 --> 02:01.232
room, when suddenly I heard a loud explosion,
followed by shrill high-pitched screams.

02:04.302 --> 02:11.442
God's word is supreme, before I
formed you in the womb, I knew you.

02:11.509 --> 02:19.350
Before you were born, I set you apart!
My focus, is on his word!

02:19.417 --> 02:24.555
Not opinion polls, not focus
groups, but his word-

04:19.036 --> 04:22.440
Scott! Ginny!
Come and grab some breakfast!

04:24.142 --> 04:27.145
Huh, I think we need a bigger bowl.

04:28.546 --> 04:31.515
Ironically, now we need a smaller bowl.

04:31.582 --> 04:32.683
Watch your feet buddy.

04:32.750 --> 04:33.952
Yes Mother.

04:34.018 --> 04:35.486
Did you lock the legs?

04:35.553 --> 04:36.587
Yes Mother dear.

04:36.654 --> 04:37.989
Uh-huh, sure you did.

04:38.056 --> 04:39.958
Now, now, now, mother.

04:40.024 --> 04:45.463
You should know that I've put this table
up many times without locking in the legs.

04:45.529 --> 04:48.366
And it just magically
stood up by itself?

04:48.432 --> 04:53.371
No faith, no honesty, no trust, in men.

04:53.437 --> 04:54.772
Oh Christ.

04:54.838 --> 05:01.579
All perjured, all forsworn, all
nought, all dissemblers.

05:01.645 --> 05:03.214
Hey Shakespeare.

05:03.281 --> 05:06.517
- Oh, Romeo and Juliet.
- Mmm, I love you.

05:06.584 --> 05:07.551
I love you.

05:07.618 --> 05:08.752
Go make the egg nog.

05:08.819 --> 05:10.621
Uhhh...

05:13.291 --> 05:15.526
[Laughs]

05:15.593 --> 05:19.397
Ohhh. Where are Peter and Suzy?
I'm starving.

05:19.463 --> 05:22.200
I want food.

05:22.266 --> 05:24.135
Crikey! It's cold.

05:24.202 --> 05:27.538
He who chops the wood, he
warms himself twice.

05:27.605 --> 05:28.572
Or herself.

05:28.639 --> 05:31.575
Aaarrrgh Ginny, my favorite sister.

05:32.476 --> 05:33.111

Oh, Sorry. I mean.

05:35.346 --> 05:38.149
Hope, is my favorite adopted sister.

05:38.216 --> 05:39.583
Gee, thanks Jerry.

05:39.650 --> 05:41.285
You know mom, there's only eight of us.

05:41.352 --> 05:43.554
Don't worry babe, they're
American servings.

05:43.621 --> 05:45.256
And you're eating for two.

05:45.323 --> 05:47.325
Yeah, two, not twenty!

05:47.391 --> 05:48.392
Hey guys!

05:48.459 --> 05:51.195
Oh Joe, where's the cranberry sauce?

05:51.262 --> 05:55.633
They're here.

05:55.699 --> 05:59.303
What took you so bloody long?

05:59.370 --> 06:00.304
Heeeeeyyy!

06:00.371 --> 06:04.442
Come on in, we've done this before.

06:04.508 --> 06:05.142
Good to see you man.

06:05.143 --> 06:05.823

06:05.843 --> 06:10.248
Yeah, great, yeah.

06:10.314 --> 06:12.250
Sooo, uh, come on in.

06:12.316 --> 06:18.456

crusade to make this the best Christmas ever.

06:18.522 --> 06:21.525

Hope's new art work.

06:32.403 --> 06:35.073
Actually the piece is
called post-cringe.

06:35.139 --> 06:37.675
Oh, well, it's delightful.

06:37.741 --> 06:39.477
I don't get it.

06:39.543 --> 06:40.311
Sorry.

06:40.378 --> 06:42.313
Well done Hope. Well Done.

06:42.380 --> 06:44.848
Dinner's in the oven, presents
in fifteen minutes.

06:44.915 --> 06:47.485
You know mom, we're in Australia,
we should be eating prawns.

06:47.551 --> 06:50.654
Whatever, its tradition,
fifteen minutes.

06:50.721 --> 06:53.091
Well, what are we supposed
to do until then?

06:53.157 --> 06:54.858
Clean the gutters.
[Laughs]

06:54.925 --> 06:56.860
Or we can play charades.

06:56.927 --> 06:59.530
[Whispered]
Or we could be in the laundry.

06:59.597 --> 07:00.664
Or that!

07:00.731 --> 07:05.369
I know, I know, I can do a recital!

07:05.436 --> 07:05.936
No.

07:06.003 --> 07:07.671
Jerry, No.

07:07.738 --> 07:11.242
Oh crap! I forgot my bell!

07:11.309 --> 07:15.613
What time'd your flight get in?

07:15.679 --> 07:16.547
Padre.

07:16.614 --> 07:18.116
What time'd your flight get in?

07:18.182 --> 07:19.650
Oh, uh, we drove.

07:19.717 --> 07:22.686
Yeah, uh, Suzy, gets anxiety,
so we don't fly.

07:22.753 --> 07:25.689
We left late last night.
After the Christmas eve sermon.

07:25.756 --> 07:28.292
Christ! Oh fuck sorry.

07:28.359 --> 07:29.427
That's all right.

07:29.493 --> 07:32.196
So you haven't slept, that's rough.

07:32.263 --> 07:34.865
Is Hope no longer allergic to peanuts?

07:34.932 --> 07:36.500
What?

07:36.567 --> 07:39.370
Oh my God, Joe!

07:39.437 --> 07:40.638
Get upstairs, wash now!

07:40.704 --> 07:41.739
I didn't touch them.

07:41.805 --> 07:44.808
I don't care, wash!
Upstairs now!

Damn it guys, come on!

07:50.548 --> 07:52.683
Why can't the kid have a goodamn peanut?

07:52.750 --> 07:56.687
Uh, you know she's allergic, Jerry
must have put them out by mistake.

07:56.754 --> 07:58.594
Sis, what doesn't kill you
make's you stronger.

07:58.656 --> 08:02.826
Yeah well it's not like dirt on her
knee, these could literally kill her.

08:02.893 --> 08:05.163
Literally?

08:05.229 --> 08:11.702
Wow.

08:52.943 --> 08:54.445
You want an egg nog?

08:54.512 --> 08:58.816
No. No thanks, I need my keys.
I think, they're, um, upstairs.

08:58.882 --> 09:00.218
Thought you just dropped them.

09:00.284 --> 09:04.955

you away from the others.

09:41.792 --> 09:46.697
Sit down honey.

09:46.764 --> 09:53.504
Thanks.

09:53.571 --> 09:56.440
That's a lot of money.

09:56.507 --> 10:00.911
I know how hard it can be,
starting a family late in life.

10:00.978 --> 10:02.746
I can't take this.

10:02.813 --> 10:07.485
Oh honey, I'm selling the house, I'm
not going to be around for very long.

10:07.551 --> 10:09.587
Mom, don't say that.

10:09.653 --> 10:15.359
[laughter] Well actually I was referring to
my trip to Europe, but thanks for the vote

10:15.426 --> 10:16.460
of confidence.

10:16.527 --> 10:18.462
You know what I mean.

10:18.529 --> 10:27.471
Suzy, you deserve to be happy, you do,
and I know fertility treatment isn't cheap.

10:27.538 --> 10:29.239
God is all the treatment we need.

10:29.307 --> 10:41.485
Well it's been six years, maybe, God
wants you to have a helping hand.

10:41.552 --> 10:47.358
You would make, such an awesome mother.

10:47.425 --> 10:49.393
It's not that simple.

Hey Uncle Joe, it's time to
open the presents.

13:53.944 --> 13:57.114
Okay, bud.

13:57.180 --> 14:00.751
Let's fucken do this.

14:00.818 --> 14:03.153
Now where is Peter?

14:03.220 --> 14:06.524
Just a minute!

Drum Roll! Bd-d-d-d-d-d-d-de!
Mother!

14:10.828 --> 14:11.995
Thank you sweetheart.

14:12.062 --> 14:13.262
They said your stutter was
getting better!

14:13.263 --> 14:15.298
Shut up Joe!

14:15.365 --> 14:20.037
Okay, this year I thought, before we opened
presents it would be nice if we went around

14:20.103 --> 14:21.872
and said what we're grateful for.

14:21.939 --> 14:23.040
Wonderful.

14:23.106 --> 14:24.908
Perhaps, Peter could lead
us in a prayer.

14:24.975 --> 14:27.645
This isn't a goddamn church. So...

14:27.711 --> 14:32.082
Very nice Virginia, perhaps you could try
setting a good example for your future child.

14:32.149 --> 14:37.087
Well, how about you don't lecture me
about parenting until you have a kid.

14:37.154 --> 14:43.594
Uh, I would like to take a moment
to pray to my personal God...

14:43.661 --> 14:46.129
medical marijuana.

14:46.196 --> 14:48.699
And Jerry's God-Fraiser.

14:48.766 --> 14:52.302
No I hate Frasier, I worship the bard,

14:52.369 --> 14:54.572
What a piece of work is a man?

14:54.638 --> 14:57.575
And here I thought this
would be so easy.

14:57.641 --> 15:01.178
Okay, so I'll start...

15:01.244 --> 15:08.218
I'm very grateful to have all my
family here for Christmas.

15:08.285 --> 15:10.287
Hope?

15:10.353 --> 15:15.258
I'm grateful that I got an early acceptance
into art school and that I don't have to spend

15:15.325 --> 15:17.595
another minute in high school.

15:17.661 --> 15:20.864
Very nice sweetheart. Scott?

15:20.931 --> 15:28.005
I'm grateful that this year, I got to promote
my profile for the World Health Organization.

15:28.071 --> 15:32.710
I'm so sorry, I'm really...
really sorry, but...

15:32.776 --> 15:35.846
...does anyone else find
this really weird?

15:35.913 --> 15:41.251
Why can't we just open our presents like normal
people and forget all this Oprah bullshit,

15:41.318 --> 15:43.320
Why is it so hard for you to
express gratitude?

15:43.386 --> 15:47.758
Well, I don't know, maybe I can't be grateful
when I know this our last Christmas in

15:47.825 --> 15:48.826
our family home.

15:48.892 --> 15:50.661
Oh honey, we've had this discussion.

15:50.728 --> 15:53.295
No, no, no, no. There was no discussion,
you told us you were going to

15:53.296 --> 15:54.932
sell the house.

15:54.998 --> 15:58.101
No, you knew Daddy and I had
decided when we turned sixty-five.

15:58.168 --> 15:59.837
Dad would have never sold this house.

15:59.903 --> 16:01.604
Perhaps you shouldn't speculate
on things you know nothing about.

16:01.605 --> 16:06.677
Do you that think Dad would be happy
that Mom's putting Jerry in a home?

16:06.744 --> 16:13.651
It's called assisted living, thank you
very much, and I work in the cafeteria!

16:13.717 --> 16:15.653
Hell yeah, Café Jerry!

16:15.719 --> 16:20.323
Dad worked his whole life for this place
and you're cashing it in for a package deal

16:20.390 --> 16:21.491
tour of Europe.

16:21.558 --> 16:23.661
We're really going to do
this on Christmas?

16:23.727 --> 16:26.730
Yeah!

16:26.797 --> 16:33.937
You know, I have done so much for you kids
and now it's my turn to do something for me.

16:34.004 --> 16:35.905
Well great as long as you're
looking after yourself mom.

16:35.906 --> 16:37.507
Babe, that's enough.

16:37.574 --> 16:40.878
You think this was an easy decision?
Your father made me promise

16:40.944 --> 16:43.013
to go on this trip.

16:43.080 --> 16:48.285
Oh, was that before or after he was doped up
on morphine, with a chunk of his brain missing?

16:48.351 --> 16:52.923
Ginny! You need to stop!

16:52.990 --> 17:00.831
You know I wish he were here, I wish I
didn't have to make this decision by myself.

17:00.898 --> 17:03.233
But I deserve to be happy.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.367
Here, here.

17:05.435 --> 17:10.140
[doorbell]

17:10.207 --> 17:11.273
[doorbell]

17:11.340 --> 17:15.813
Now, who could be calling
on Christmas day?

17:15.878 --> 17:19.482
Probably Bible bashers.
No offence Padre.

17:19.549 --> 17:21.218
That's very offensive Joe.

17:21.284 --> 17:23.787
Well it could be one of
my idiot friends.

17:23.854 --> 17:24.855
[doorbell]

17:24.922 --> 17:27.724
Alright, I'll get it!

17:27.790 --> 17:32.303
Good one Ginny, you're incapable of
thinking about anyone else but yourself.

17:40.370 --> 17:41.939
Ohhh...

17:42.005 --> 17:43.106
Yes?

17:43.173 --> 17:50.881
Good afternoon, is your name... Diane?

17:50.948 --> 17:54.051
Yes. What can I do for you?

17:54.117 --> 17:56.286
Well, you just hold onto that.

17:56.353 --> 18:01.258
[Coughing]

18:01.324 --> 18:05.428
Sorry I...
[Coughing]

18:05.495 --> 18:09.967
Would you... like to come in and
warm up for a moment?

18:10.033 --> 18:13.336
Yes... [Coughing]
I have a letter... [coughing]

18:13.403 --> 18:15.072
For your mother...

18:15.138 --> 18:16.239
Yes.

18:16.306 --> 18:30.453
[Coughing]

18:30.520 --> 18:34.357
Mister Cletus, may I take your cloak?

18:34.424 --> 18:35.425
No.

18:35.492 --> 18:41.069
Thank you.
I need to leave it on.

18:46.136 --> 18:47.938
Would you like a warm drink?

18:48.005 --> 18:49.506
Perhaps for the road?

18:49.572 --> 18:54.377
A cup of tea please...

18:54.444 --> 18:56.479
And a straw.

18:56.546 --> 18:57.981
Of course.

18:58.048 --> 18:58.982
I'll help you mom.

18:59.049 --> 18:59.817
No, I'll, I'll...

18:59.883 --> 19:02.085
No it's okay, I've got it.

19:02.152 --> 19:07.357
Yeah, of course you do.

19:07.424 --> 19:11.194
So... Cletus is it?

19:11.261 --> 19:12.295
Yes.

19:12.362 --> 19:14.197
Oh.

19:14.264 --> 19:17.835
[Comical Redneck Accent] You don't sound
like you're from the south, Cletus.

19:17.901 --> 19:20.237
[laughter]

19:20.303 --> 19:23.306
No.

19:23.373 --> 19:25.208
Are you cold?

19:25.275 --> 19:26.409
Yes.

19:26.476 --> 19:29.612
Oh, Is that why you're
wearing the cloak?

19:29.679 --> 19:31.414
Yes.

19:31.481 --> 19:35.518
It keeps my skin on.

19:35.585 --> 19:38.088
Oh.

19:38.155 --> 19:43.226
Yeah... well I got to...

19:43.293 --> 19:49.900
Oh, fuck it.

19:49.967 --> 19:52.936
So, do you live nearby?

19:53.003 --> 19:57.875
I'd like to read my letter.

19:57.941 --> 20:03.280
Oh...

20:03.346 --> 20:05.949
He's creepy and he smells like urine.

20:06.016 --> 20:07.284
It's Christmas.

20:07.350 --> 20:10.353
So? It's not let in a vagrant day.

20:10.420 --> 20:13.423
Cheers for letting Satan
into the house Di.

20:13.490 --> 20:14.757
Oh, shut up Joe.

20:14.824 --> 20:17.995
Well maybe he's lost and we
should call someone.

20:18.061 --> 20:19.596
He's not a dog guys.

20:19.662 --> 20:21.064
You could ask.

20:21.131 --> 20:23.901
I'm sure the number for the
pound is in here somewhere.

20:23.967 --> 20:26.103
Yes, with the straw.

20:26.169 --> 20:27.504
Come on, let's go.

20:27.570 --> 20:30.273
[Laughter]

20:30.340 --> 20:33.310
Here we go.

20:33.376 --> 20:36.980
So, uh, Cletus, would you like
to use the telephone?

20:37.047 --> 20:38.916
No. Thank you.

20:38.982 --> 20:40.951
We'd be happy to call someone for you.

20:41.018 --> 20:43.954
I'd like to read my letter.

20:44.021 --> 20:48.158
Well, we were, we were actually about
to just open, uh, presents, weren't we?

20:48.225 --> 20:48.758
Yeah.

20:48.825 --> 20:49.927
Yeah. Yeah.

20:49.993 --> 20:53.063
What are presents?

20:53.130 --> 20:55.198
You've never heard of presents?

20:55.265 --> 20:57.334
No.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.303
Uh, excuse me, I'm going to get
some honey for the tea.

21:00.370 --> 21:05.008
Cletus, do you remember the gospel of Matthew
where the three wise men go and visit

21:05.075 --> 21:06.043
the new born Lord?

21:06.109 --> 21:08.511
Yes. The Negroids.

21:08.578 --> 21:10.948
Uh, excuse me?
[Laughter]

21:11.014 --> 21:12.782
Uh, It's African-American.

21:12.849 --> 21:17.587
Uh, actually the Magi were from
different regions from around Israel.

21:17.654 --> 21:19.990
They, they weren't American.

21:20.057 --> 21:22.059
Yes sir, the Negroids.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.227
Can you please stop saying that?

21:24.294 --> 21:29.232
Well the Magi brought with them gifts, gold,
frankincense and myrrh and we give each other

21:29.299 --> 21:32.970
gifts at Christmas in the
tradition of the three wise men.

21:33.036 --> 21:34.604
Because it's also fun.

21:34.671 --> 21:35.872
Cletus...

21:35.939 --> 21:38.976
My family would like to
give you a present.

21:39.042 --> 21:40.443
My family?

21:40.510 --> 21:43.246
Yes, our family to you.

21:43.313 --> 21:49.052
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen.

21:49.119 --> 21:51.321
Take the paper off bro.

21:51.388 --> 21:52.822
Why?

21:52.889 --> 21:57.394
It's the wrapping paper bud,
what's inside, that's for you.

21:57.460 --> 21:59.396
Like a letter.

21:59.462 --> 22:05.768
Hmmph. Sure.

22:05.835 --> 22:09.006
Sorry it's not very much.

22:09.072 --> 22:12.009
They are so beautiful.

22:12.075 --> 22:16.413
Uh... I can't accept this present.

22:16.479 --> 22:18.581
Well you have to.
It's a Christmas present.

22:18.648 --> 22:20.583
I can't.

22:20.650 --> 22:25.422
Well, it's okay Cletus, we can't have them
in the house anyway I'm allergic to them.

22:25.488 --> 22:27.024
Are you sure?

22:27.090 --> 22:28.391
Yes dear.

22:28.458 --> 22:39.436
Ohhh... thank you.
I'd like to read my letter now.

22:39.502 --> 22:41.404
Dear Mother.

22:41.471 --> 22:46.443
I hope that this letter finds you well.

22:46.509 --> 22:59.056
My father believed in vengeance, but I believe
in love. I'm writing to inform you of an

22:59.122 --> 23:08.231
extraordinary occurrence, an event which is
impossible for you to know anything about.

23:08.298 --> 23:10.100
Um... are... we...

23:10.167 --> 23:17.774
Twenty years have passed since I entered
the world in such heroic circumstances.

23:17.840 --> 23:25.215
With my father's passing, I have left his
care and gone in search of my family.

23:25.282 --> 23:30.587
My man, maybe you can save your reading
until you get to your family, huh?

23:30.653 --> 23:37.727
Two decades ago my father extinguished
the lives of two child murderers at the.

23:37.794 --> 23:40.630
Northland Medical Clinic.

23:40.697 --> 23:42.232
What do you want?

23:42.299 --> 23:45.602
Pardon my reading I am slow.

23:45.668 --> 23:48.371
Oh, I think you know exactly
what you're doing.

23:48.438 --> 23:50.407
Mom, what's happening, are you okay?

23:50.473 --> 23:56.146
He's talking about an abortion clinic up
in the city. How dare you bring this stuff

23:56.213 --> 23:59.182
into my house, especially
on Christmas Day.

23:59.249 --> 24:01.218
Well, it is a Christian message.

24:01.284 --> 24:04.854
I mean no offence.

24:04.921 --> 24:08.158
I approach from a place of love.

24:08.225 --> 24:10.527
You need to leave now.

24:10.593 --> 24:16.166
During my father's liberation of
life, he came across my...

24:16.233 --> 24:18.401
[Shouting] Get out!
You get him out!

24:18.468 --> 24:20.036
[Shouting]
Get out him out!

24:20.103 --> 24:26.776
[Shouting] Get out him out of my house
right now! Get him out!

24:26.843 --> 24:33.550
[Shouting] Get out him out!
Get him out of here!

24:33.616 --> 24:36.786
Oomph!
[sobbing]

24:36.853 --> 24:40.157
I got a shotgun in the shed, you
come back and I'll use it.

24:40.223 --> 24:41.924
Don't you ever come back!

24:41.991 --> 24:45.295
[clink]

24:45.362 --> 24:47.697
Jerry, Joe, get inside.

24:47.764 --> 24:51.434
[Sobbing]

24:51.501 --> 24:53.470
Get out!

24:53.536 --> 24:57.840
Get! Out!

24:57.907 --> 25:03.813
Goddamn son-of-a-bitch.

25:03.880 --> 25:05.282
What the hell was that?

25:05.348 --> 25:08.218
Some pro-life piece of shit
protesting on Christmas Day.

25:08.285 --> 25:10.287
Piece of trash!

25:10.353 --> 25:13.655
What kind of an asshole dresses up on Christmas
Day and scares the hell out of families?

25:13.656 --> 25:15.858
Uncle Joe you should have blown
his fucken' head off!

25:15.925 --> 25:17.327
Ginny! That's too much.

25:17.394 --> 25:20.263
Too much! These are the people
that assassinate doctors!

25:20.330 --> 25:25.235
He wanted to upset mom and hurt
her on Christmas day! I hate him!

25:25.302 --> 25:28.571
Jerry, you need to calm down,
breathe, breathe.

25:28.638 --> 25:30.373
P-p-perhaps we should call the police.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.874
Yes. He could be dangerous.

25:31.941 --> 25:35.345
You know this is exactly why I
don't go to church anymore.

25:35.412 --> 25:36.413
We're not all extremists.

25:36.479 --> 25:38.281
Maybe we should call the sheriff.

25:38.348 --> 25:40.783
Is it true?

25:40.850 --> 25:42.018
What?

25:42.084 --> 25:46.889
When dad was sick did you
have a miscarriage?

25:46.956 --> 25:50.227
Diane!

25:50.293 --> 25:50.993
Oh mom.

25:51.060 --> 26:03.640
Oh Suzy.

26:03.706 --> 26:13.782
[Sobbing]

26:13.783 --> 26:23.793
[Sobbing]

26:32.735 --> 26:35.605
Mother! Mother!

26:35.672 --> 26:43.280
[Sobbing]

26:43.346 --> 26:55.725
Mother!
[sobbing]

26:55.792 --> 27:02.999
Mother!

27:03.065 --> 27:05.702
Uhhh.

27:05.768 --> 27:07.304
Uhhh.

27:07.370 --> 27:08.438
Wooh!

27:08.505 --> 27:09.672
You all right buddy?

27:09.739 --> 27:13.075
Yes madam Ginny, I need
another cream pie.

27:13.142 --> 27:19.349
Of course.

27:19.416 --> 27:21.318
You better not be going to the kitchen.

27:21.384 --> 27:22.018
No.

27:22.084 --> 27:23.386
No more cream pies

27:23.453 --> 27:33.330
I'm not! I'm getting a
glass of water for Hope!

27:33.396 --> 27:34.430
[Laughing]
What are you doing?

27:34.431 --> 27:36.366
I'm sorry to do this to you, I...

27:36.433 --> 27:37.266
What?

27:37.334 --> 27:43.740
You know my... I got to ask...

27:43.806 --> 27:48.044
Is it possible that... What he
said was true, with the kid and...

27:48.110 --> 27:49.479
What? No!

27:49.546 --> 27:50.947
You certain?

27:51.013 --> 27:53.883
Oh! It's called an abortion
that's the whole point.

27:53.950 --> 27:54.951
Yeah-

27:55.017 --> 27:58.888
Yeah, sure, but you were
out of it right?

27:58.955 --> 28:01.624
- Oh... my God. - A lot of unexpected
things happened on that day.

28:01.691 --> 28:07.096
Oh My God! Oh My God!
Look, this was a stupid prank by

28:07.163 --> 28:08.765
a bunch of assholes with a

28:08.831 --> 28:10.999
- police report and a phone book, okay!?
- Yeah, you're right.

28:11.000 --> 28:17.474
Uh, can we not give it anymore of our time on
Christmas day please and fix the bloody door.

28:17.540 --> 28:20.109
Fuck yeah! Yeah. Of course.

28:20.176 --> 28:23.846
I'll fix the door.

28:23.913 --> 28:29.051
All right, all right.

28:29.118 --> 28:32.389
[chop]

28:32.455 --> 28:34.424
Bro, sure you don't want any?

28:34.491 --> 28:39.796
Oh, no, tempting, but no thank you.

28:39.862 --> 28:41.063
Not allowed hey?

28:41.130 --> 28:43.099
Oh, no, no, the church.

28:43.165 --> 28:47.937
Yeah.

28:48.004 --> 28:50.172
Nice arse!

28:50.239 --> 28:51.541
Don't you think Pete? Huh?

28:51.608 --> 28:52.488
Well, I wouldn't know.

28:52.509 --> 28:54.276
[Laughter]

28:54.343 --> 28:58.681
You know a woman's breasts can grow
two cup sizes when she's pregnant.

28:58.748 --> 29:00.216
I see.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.618
I don't know if you've noticed,
but mine have gotten bigger.

29:02.619 --> 29:04.654
No, I'm sorry I have not.
[Laughter]

29:04.721 --> 29:07.056
Oh did you... did you want some?

29:07.123 --> 29:08.425
Oh no thank you.

29:08.491 --> 29:09.211
You should try it.

29:09.225 --> 29:12.028
Yep I'm fine. Thank you.

29:12.094 --> 29:15.632
[coughing]

29:15.698 --> 29:17.166
Oh, relax, it's natural.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.334
Tisk.

29:18.401 --> 29:21.203
It's your unborn baby I'm
thinking about.

29:21.270 --> 29:24.073
Oh, cheers, thank you.

29:24.140 --> 29:30.112
[Laughter]

29:30.179 --> 29:34.851
You! You keep your pot to yourself.

29:34.917 --> 29:40.457
Good idea.

29:40.523 --> 29:50.599
[birds chirping]

29:50.600 --> 30:00.610
[birds chirping]

30:15.892 --> 30:25.967

[Sobbing]

30:38.848 --> 30:39.982
[Scream]

30:40.049 --> 30:42.519
We're going out to watch the
sunset, anybody?

30:42.585 --> 30:43.185
I'll come.

Hey, sit down you crazy kook, relax!

31:14.016 --> 31:18.788
Oh, I'm fine thank you Joe.

31:18.855 --> 31:22.296
You can't give her the

31:35.805 --> 31:37.774
I'm putting it in the fridge.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.842
Mom says it doesn't go in the fridge.

31:39.909 --> 31:40.877
What?

31:40.943 --> 31:42.278
No, I'm being serious.

31:42.344 --> 31:44.279
Don't be contrary Virginia, it
belongs in the fridge.

31:44.280 --> 31:49.156
Uh, I'm not being contrary, mom says it's
meringue and it doesn't go in the fridge.

32:04.934 --> 32:08.137
Okay, you don't have to lie, if
you want some take it.

32:08.204 --> 32:10.907
I'm not lying, just leave it
on the goddam table.

32:10.973 --> 32:16.145
Oh come on you two, out half in
the table and half in the fridge.

32:18.314 --> 32:20.316
Good!

32:21.584 --> 32:23.952
I don't particularly care what mom says,
it's a meringue so it belongs in the fridge.

32:23.953 --> 32:28.230
Yeah, well, she made it, so why
don't we let her decide!

32:34.296 --> 32:39.201

01:03:47.201 --> 01:03:52.139
Lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil.

01:03:52.206 --> 01:04:00.180
Kingdom come and your glory,
forever and ever. Amen.

01:04:00.247 --> 01:04:06.754
Goddam you! Let me out!

01:04:06.821 --> 01:04:12.693
Do you pray Cletus?

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:20.935
Shall we pray together?

01:04:21.001 --> 01:04:30.681
Lord, we give thanks that you were able to
bring us all here together for Christmas Day.

01:04:33.748 --> 01:04:39.086
Including the family's youngest son who had
been unknown to the members of the family

01:04:39.153 --> 01:04:41.822
since birth.

01:04:41.889 --> 01:04:47.762
Lord, we take pity on the innocents of the
family who were not aware of the choices

01:04:47.828 --> 01:04:50.698
made by their mother.

01:04:50.765 --> 01:04:58.673
What Diane did to her youngest son was wrong
and we ask you for your forgiveness dear Lord.

01:04:58.739 --> 01:05:05.580
Lord we know it was your plan for Cletus to be
born different with Down's Syndrome and other

01:05:05.646 --> 01:05:08.315
gifts that people may misunderstand.

01:05:08.382 --> 01:05:15.122
We know it was a sin for Diane to try and abort
him, but Lord, you kept him alive and you

01:05:15.189 --> 01:05:18.626
brought him here today.

01:05:18.693 --> 01:05:23.230
Is there anything else you'd lie to
add, Cletus? Brought him here today.

01:05:23.297 --> 01:05:25.673
I'm sorry.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:38.613

Help somebody!

01:06:12.379 --> 01:06:13.914
Ah!

01:06:13.981 --> 01:06:16.250
Oh. Jerry.

01:06:16.316 --> 01:06:17.250
We have to get up to the-

01:06:17.251 --> 01:06:18.986
No!

01:06:19.053 --> 01:06:21.221
Peter's dead!

01:06:21.288 --> 01:06:24.058
You tried to abort me!

01:06:24.124 --> 01:06:25.192
Answer me!

01:06:25.259 --> 01:06:27.327
Did you try to abort me?

01:06:27.394 --> 01:06:30.164
No sweetheart. I love you.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:31.531
Of course not.

01:06:31.598 --> 01:06:36.203
Did you abort Cletus because
he's got Down's Syndrome?

01:06:36.270 --> 01:06:42.677
Yes, but your daddy and I loved
you, we wanted you.

01:06:42.743 --> 01:06:45.312
You want to kill me too?

01:06:45.379 --> 01:06:46.881
No.

01:06:46.947 --> 01:06:48.215
You want to kill me?

01:06:48.282 --> 01:06:49.717
No.

01:06:49.784 --> 01:06:52.386
You don't love me anymore.

01:06:52.452 --> 01:06:58.092
I do love you, I do love you.

01:06:58.158 --> 01:07:01.328
No, Jerry!

01:07:01.395 --> 01:07:03.671
Jerry, open the door.

01:07:11.672 --> 01:07:13.682
Jerry, open the door.

01:08:53.874 --> 01:09:00.180
Jerry. Oh baby. I'm sorry.

01:09:00.247 --> 01:09:08.587
When, when Mommy got pregnant and we found
out you were special, we were so excited.

01:09:08.654 --> 01:09:10.724
We,

01:09:10.791 --> 01:09:22.002
We wanted to have you so much and then Daddy
got sick, and I got so sad, I just, couldn't

01:09:22.069 --> 01:09:26.874
have another baby without Daddy.

01:09:26.941 --> 01:09:35.950
I just love you so much, I would
never want to take you away from me.

01:09:36.015 --> 01:09:43.924
Can you come with Mommy now? Let's
go upstairs where we're safe

01:09:43.991 --> 01:09:47.304
Jerry. Okay?

01:09:57.371 --> 01:10:00.318

01:10:20.627 --> 01:10:22.963
Oh,

01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:33.307
Oh my baby. Oh my baby.
I'm sorry.

Ah.

01:11:10.277 --> 01:11:11.645
Mother...

01:11:11.711 --> 01:11:23.657

to kill your children?
