00:01.767 --> 00:04.367
(upbeat music)

00:08.267 --> 00:09.167
(car beeping)

00:09.167 --> 00:12.300
(upbeat music)

00:12.300 --> 00:13.467
* Come on home

00:13.467 --> 00:14.667
* Come on home baby now

00:14.667 --> 00:16.133
* You know I'm
waiting here for you *

00:16.133 --> 00:18.333
* I'm coming home
now real soon *

00:18.333 --> 00:19.500
* You've been gone

00:19.500 --> 00:21.000
* Coming home baby now

00:21.000 --> 00:22.800
* You don't know what
I'm going through *

00:22.800 --> 00:24.600
* I'm coming home I
know I'm overdue *

00:24.600 --> 00:26.300
* Since you've went away

00:26.300 --> 00:29.467
* Expect me any
day now real soon *

00:29.467 --> 00:32.233
* I'm coming home and
never more to go *

00:32.233 --> 00:33.533
* Maybe tell me you

00:33.533 --> 00:37.800
* Baby I'm for
sure coming home *

00:37.800 --> 00:38.767
* I'm coming home

00:38.767 --> 00:40.900
* I'm coming home

00:40.900 --> 00:43.467
(upbeat music)

00:48.067 --> 00:50.633
(water rowing)

01:01.700 --> 01:03.600
(boat squashes)

01:03.600 --> 01:05.200
(duck quacking)

01:05.200 --> 01:07.067
- Ouch

01:07.067 --> 01:09.467
(man groans)

01:09.467 --> 01:11.233
(door bangs)

01:11.233 --> 01:13.533
- The rowing team
is an epic fail,

01:13.533 --> 01:16.100
Mr Vicksox is a geography
teacher not a coach,

01:16.100 --> 01:18.700
it's his fault that the
stupid boat keeps crashing.

01:18.700 --> 01:19.633
- I don't think that
you liked rowing.

01:19.633 --> 01:21.500
- That's not the point,

01:21.500 --> 01:22.867
the inter school
regatta is next week

01:22.867 --> 01:24.800
and I need to participate
in order to win

01:24.800 --> 01:27.467
the Nancy Drew Smith trophy
for best all around student.

01:27.467 --> 01:28.933
Why are dad's pants down?

01:28.933 --> 01:30.167
- He's got an ingrown hair.

01:30.167 --> 01:32.700
- I have a pilonidal
cyst on my spine.

01:32.700 --> 01:33.900
- Above your coccyx.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.300
- It's very serious

01:35.300 --> 01:37.233
I have to have emergency
surgery on Friday.

01:37.233 --> 01:39.400
- Well, it's not really
emergency surgery

01:39.400 --> 01:41.233
I just asked Helen if
she could squeeze you in.

01:41.233 --> 01:42.900
- Mom, I've worked
so hard all year

01:42.900 --> 01:43.933
and if we can't finish the race,

01:43.933 --> 01:45.400
I won't get the trophy.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.633
- Isn't the point that
you've worked hard all year?

01:47.633 --> 01:48.867
- Can you not give
me parental advice

01:48.867 --> 01:49.833
while you've got
your pants down?

01:49.833 --> 01:50.667
- Okay.

01:50.667 --> 01:52.633
I need those points.

01:52.633 --> 01:54.167
Susie Uhm is gonna win otherwise

01:54.167 --> 01:56.467
because she's doing the
badminton competition.

01:56.467 --> 01:57.700
- Well sweetheart,

01:57.700 --> 01:59.433
maybe Susie is
good at badminton.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.733
- That is so racist,

02:01.733 --> 02:04.067
just because she's Asian
she's good at badminton?

02:04.067 --> 02:05.200
- No.

02:05.200 --> 02:06.533
- She's terrible at sport.

02:08.933 --> 02:09.967
I'm not.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.067
There are four
rowers in my boat,

02:13.067 --> 02:14.867
but you think I'm the weak link.

02:14.867 --> 02:16.267
- No.
- Of course not.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.600
Its just that you are.

02:17.600 --> 02:18.400
- You're not particularly
- coordinated.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.800
- Remember the shot put?

02:19.800 --> 02:20.600
- You broke your arm.

02:20.600 --> 02:21.433
- And the window.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.267
- At the same time.

02:23.367 --> 02:24.200
- Oh, what about a tutor?

02:24.200 --> 02:25.933
- A tutor?

02:25.933 --> 02:27.833
Could there be anything
more embarrassing

02:27.833 --> 02:29.333
than a tutor for sport?

02:29.333 --> 02:30.967
- Having one for
religious education.

02:30.967 --> 02:32.600
- Let's just leave
Oscar out of this.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.400
- I don't have tutors.

02:35.400 --> 02:38.867
- You also don't have the
Nancy Drew Smith trophy.

02:39.900 --> 02:42.133
- Who do we know that rows?

02:42.133 --> 02:42.967
(hands clapping)

02:42.967 --> 02:43.800
- And stroke

02:45.067 --> 02:45.967
and stroke.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.200
- How long is that?

02:49.833 --> 02:50.667
- Three minutes.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.733
- How far have I gone?

02:52.700 --> 02:54.167
- 22 meters.

02:54.167 --> 02:55.700
(machine bangs)

02:55.700 --> 02:57.567
Girl, you need to be on the
rowing machine like full-time

02:57.567 --> 02:59.067
for six months to be ready,

02:59.067 --> 03:00.267
when is it?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.067
- Next weekend.

03:02.300 --> 03:03.633
- Can you do before
school as well as after?

03:03.633 --> 03:06.700
- It's not just me, my
entire crew was bad,

03:06.700 --> 03:08.867
what happened to there
being no I in team?

03:08.867 --> 03:10.400
- I can't tutor the whole crew.

03:12.600 --> 03:14.233
- Yes you can,

03:14.233 --> 03:16.067
you can coach us,

03:16.067 --> 03:17.867
you need to because we're all

03:17.867 --> 03:18.900
- Crap?

03:18.900 --> 03:20.067
- Physically challenged.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.400
- You have a coach.

03:21.400 --> 03:23.267
- We have a clueless
geography teacher filling in

03:23.267 --> 03:25.233
because the school can't
find a replacement.

03:25.233 --> 03:26.933
He doesn't know
anything about rowing.

03:26.933 --> 03:27.967
- Apart from this machine

03:27.967 --> 03:29.167
and that Olympic Folsom

03:29.167 --> 03:30.833
that sing about for
it neither do I.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.767
- It's just like
this but on water.

03:32.767 --> 03:34.233
- And with no tele,

03:34.233 --> 03:35.067
nailed it.

03:36.067 --> 03:37.500
- Please come,

03:37.500 --> 03:39.867
I promise there are girls worse
than me that need your help.

03:39.867 --> 03:40.767
- Worse?

03:41.833 --> 03:44.300
Okay, that'd be
seriously funny to see,

03:44.300 --> 03:45.167
no offense.

03:45.167 --> 03:46.467
(door squeaks)

03:46.467 --> 03:48.167
(motorbike roaring)

03:48.167 --> 03:49.067
(door bangs)

03:49.067 --> 03:49.833
- Sean?

03:55.600 --> 03:57.133
(phone ringing)

03:57.133 --> 03:58.167
- Where the fuck are you?

03:58.167 --> 03:59.267
- Hi Amber.

03:59.267 --> 04:00.267
- Hi mom.

04:00.267 --> 04:01.500
- How could you not see my note?

04:01.500 --> 04:03.067
All you do is eat cereal.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.433
- I had to do some emergency
babysitting for dad.

04:05.433 --> 04:06.267
- What's happened?

04:06.267 --> 04:07.733
- Nothing.

04:07.733 --> 04:09.467
Dad surprised Michelle with
a trip to the Gold Coast

04:09.467 --> 04:10.933
that he won in a work raffle.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.267
Mom, what's wrong?

04:14.267 --> 04:16.667
- Dad and work in
the same sentence,

04:16.667 --> 04:18.767
when did Troy become a
functioning human being?

04:18.767 --> 04:19.700
- I know, right?

04:19.700 --> 04:21.200
That's why I'm happy to help.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.700
- Even after we split up,

04:22.700 --> 04:24.400
he can still find a way
to stand me up for dinner.

04:24.400 --> 04:26.467
(air roars)

04:26.467 --> 04:27.300
- Oh my god, no.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.100
(upbeat music)

04:31.100 --> 04:33.667
(water rowing)

04:40.233 --> 04:42.833
(boat crashes)

04:46.067 --> 04:48.067
- Okay, that was
more sad than funny,

04:49.067 --> 04:50.267
we guys have three days

04:50.267 --> 04:53.067
it's cold, dark,
hard, and creepy.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.300
There's a homeless guy sleeping
in that boat over there.

04:58.300 --> 05:00.667
- That's Mr Vicksox, our coach,

05:00.667 --> 05:02.600
see why we need
you to take over?

05:02.600 --> 05:04.167
- Why isn't she rowing?

05:04.167 --> 05:05.400
- Maranda,

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
she's our reserve.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.833
- She looks like she could row.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.300
- She had a knee
operation last year,

05:10.300 --> 05:13.067
she just got out of
her calipers please.

05:13.067 --> 05:14.267
- Babe no offense but

05:14.267 --> 05:15.833
why would I take on
five uncos out here

05:15.833 --> 05:18.067
when your mum is paying
me 60 bucks a sesh

05:18.067 --> 05:19.200
to train one unco

05:19.200 --> 05:20.900
in the comfort of my own home?

05:20.900 --> 05:22.333
- I checked with
the sports office

05:22.333 --> 05:25.533
coaches get paid 1500 a week.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.733
- That's exactly why,

05:27.733 --> 05:29.067
when do we leave?

05:29.067 --> 05:30.067
- Ah, ah, ah.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.167
- How many stitches was it?

05:34.167 --> 05:35.267
- I don't know
how deep they cut,

05:35.267 --> 05:37.300
I think maybe 18.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.467
- Four,

05:38.467 --> 05:40.867
but they were four very big ones

05:40.867 --> 05:42.800
I am worried about
you being on your own.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.233
- Yeah and that's why I'm
coming to the Murray river.

05:45.233 --> 05:46.067
- You can't travel that distance

05:46.067 --> 05:47.667
you can't even sit down.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.067
- I could stand with you dad.

05:49.067 --> 05:49.933
- Oh, oh, oh

05:49.933 --> 05:52.600
no, no, never in a million.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.067
I thought you and Caspian
were in the cheer squad.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.633
- Only because it's compulsory
if you don't make the team.

06:00.633 --> 06:02.067
Cheer squad is lame.

06:02.067 --> 06:04.267
- It most certainly is not lame,

06:04.267 --> 06:05.100
is it Danny?

06:05.100 --> 06:06.067
- Well, it is kind of.

06:06.067 --> 06:07.267
- Ouch,

06:07.267 --> 06:08.100
what you make of it.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.067
- Exactly,

06:09.067 --> 06:09.967
what would the Olympics be like

06:09.967 --> 06:11.233
if there were no supporters?

06:11.233 --> 06:12.533
- The Commonwealth games.

06:12.533 --> 06:13.367
- Oh okay,

06:13.367 --> 06:15.100
Mate, you know what?

06:15.100 --> 06:17.633
Cheer squad is just as
important as the race

06:17.633 --> 06:18.900
if not more so,

06:18.900 --> 06:21.100
It's up to you to
make a difference.

06:21.100 --> 06:23.200
Baby, I really wanna go
and support our kids.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.933
- No, you wanna
support the wineries

06:24.933 --> 06:27.300
and providores because
it's foodie paradise.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.733
You're not coming,

06:28.733 --> 06:30.467
you can stay home and
binge watch Game of Thrones

06:30.467 --> 06:32.367
so you stop feeling left
out at dinner parties.

06:32.367 --> 06:33.200
- Don't want to.

06:33.200 --> 06:34.900
- It's not scary dad.

06:34.900 --> 06:36.133
- I'm not scared of it.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.400
- But every time we
start to watch it

06:37.400 --> 06:39.433
you get worried about
the White Walkers

06:39.433 --> 06:40.867
you hide behind the cushions

06:40.867 --> 06:41.767
and then you go to bed.

06:41.767 --> 06:42.833
- Hide behind the,

06:42.833 --> 06:45.967
I get sleepy behind the cushions

06:45.967 --> 06:48.067
because Game of
Thrones is boring,

06:48.067 --> 06:49.067
it's not scary.

06:50.433 --> 06:52.333
Don't you have some cheer
squad stuff to get together?

06:52.333 --> 06:54.333
- Only a maroon T-shirt.

06:54.333 --> 06:55.333
- Well that's it?

06:55.333 --> 06:56.267
Oh, that's great,

06:56.267 --> 06:57.633
if you're playing the lame game

06:57.633 --> 07:00.300
come one get busy
make a difference now.

07:03.800 --> 07:04.800
I'm not scared.

07:05.833 --> 07:07.300
You have to buy me cheese.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.067
(upbeat music)

07:10.067 --> 07:12.900
(woman kissing)

07:12.900 --> 07:14.267
- Good luck with the car chain.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.800
Is two types of
powder gonna be enough

07:15.800 --> 07:17.367
for the girls for the weekend?

07:17.367 --> 07:18.733
- You can't give them
supplements you dickhead

07:18.733 --> 07:19.667
they're children.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.467
You sure you're gonna be okay?

07:22.467 --> 07:24.067
- I'm fine.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.500
- Are you at a playground?

07:25.500 --> 07:27.067
- I'm sort of,

07:27.067 --> 07:29.067
I'm in the cubby that dad built.

07:29.067 --> 07:30.700
- He built a cubby?

07:30.700 --> 07:32.867
When did he learn
how to build a cubby?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.067
(wood creaks)

07:34.067 --> 07:35.467
- He didn't.

07:35.467 --> 07:36.933
- I'm worried about you being
on your own with the kids.

07:36.933 --> 07:39.067
- Well dad's put all
their meals in the fridge

07:39.067 --> 07:41.167
and I've got heaps of
homework to do anyway.

07:41.167 --> 07:42.133
Say bye bye, Amber.

07:42.133 --> 07:43.833
- Bye bye Amber.

07:43.833 --> 07:44.800
- Bye mom.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.367
- Amber,

07:46.367 --> 07:47.700
we might get a headstart

07:47.700 --> 07:49.233
'cause I don't think
I can go much faster

07:49.233 --> 07:51.133
than 130 with this
much gear on the back.

07:51.133 --> 07:52.667
- You sure Evan's on his way?

07:52.667 --> 07:54.167
- He said he had to
pick something up.

07:54.167 --> 07:55.067
- Oh my God,

07:55.933 --> 07:57.400
he sure did.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.800
(rock music)

08:12.300 --> 08:13.133
- Belonged to my dad,

08:13.133 --> 08:14.500
he was a mechanic,

08:14.500 --> 08:15.733
on the BP survey,

08:15.733 --> 08:17.400
always doing some
trading on the side,

08:17.400 --> 08:18.600
loved his boats.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.933
- And had a terrific
sense of humor.

08:20.933 --> 08:23.067
- Evan I could do a
graphic to go with that,

08:23.067 --> 08:25.267
like a squirrel holding
its hands between its legs.

08:25.267 --> 08:27.100
- My dad would have
loved you Kayne.

08:27.100 --> 08:30.200
- Oh, she's beautiful Evan.

08:30.200 --> 08:31.700
- Isn't she?

08:31.700 --> 08:34.600
- Dad, it's an
original 308 mint,

08:34.600 --> 08:35.700
so sexy.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.400
- Look out you've aroused Kayne.

08:38.400 --> 08:39.333
You sure you wanna bring it?

08:39.333 --> 08:41.367
You might never get it back.

08:41.367 --> 08:44.133
- That's the idea it's
a present for you.

08:44.133 --> 08:45.067
- What do you mean?

08:45.067 --> 08:46.267
- I want you to have it.

08:46.267 --> 08:47.100
- The boat?

08:47.100 --> 08:48.100
- No, the towboat,

08:48.100 --> 08:48.967
yes the boat.

08:50.067 --> 08:52.733
- I can't take it.
- No of course you can.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.933
Come on, let's go.

08:57.233 --> 08:59.567
- Push, pull, pull, release,

09:02.200 --> 09:03.767
a little harder on your right,

09:03.767 --> 09:06.267
stretch, control, entry, push,

09:08.400 --> 09:10.800
draw, pull, release, stretch.

09:13.900 --> 09:15.233
Oh my God girls,

09:16.367 --> 09:19.967
you are literally not
on curve right now

09:19.967 --> 09:23.100
don't just see how good it
is to keep your eyes open?

09:23.100 --> 09:27.900
Jolie down that straight,
Cassie headed your way.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.400
(rock music)

09:30.400 --> 09:32.067
(boat roaring)

09:32.067 --> 09:33.400
(girl screams)

09:33.400 --> 09:35.833
(rock music)

09:43.533 --> 09:45.067
- Well, I can do it barefoot too

09:45.067 --> 09:46.933
but dad's always
been a two ski guy.

09:46.933 --> 09:49.367
(rock music)

09:52.100 --> 09:53.367
- Amber,

09:53.367 --> 09:54.200
Amber

09:55.467 --> 09:56.533
- Amber, what are you doing?

09:56.533 --> 09:58.300
You're meant to be spotting.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.867
(upbeat music)

10:05.200 --> 10:08.800
- Amber, we need
your complete focus.

10:08.800 --> 10:09.933
- And dad used to stay up longer

10:09.933 --> 10:12.333
than ten bloody seconds.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.433
I looked away for what,
two, three minutes?

10:14.433 --> 10:15.700
- Can I remind you,

10:15.700 --> 10:18.633
it's hard to judge the
horizon with one eye.

10:18.633 --> 10:19.467
- You okay?

10:19.467 --> 10:20.300
- Yeah.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.500
- Yeah, really?

10:21.500 --> 10:22.933
I feel like you're
upset about something.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.900
- I am, my dad can't skate,

10:24.900 --> 10:26.033
go.

10:26.033 --> 10:29.467
(boat engine revs)

10:29.467 --> 10:32.033
(upbeat music)

10:34.733 --> 10:35.500
- My girls,

10:36.500 --> 10:37.933
oh yes,

10:37.933 --> 10:39.433
love it,

10:39.433 --> 10:41.633
so proud.

10:41.633 --> 10:43.600
And look at you, Sophie,

10:43.600 --> 10:45.467
dry, what's that like?

10:45.467 --> 10:46.700
- We can race,

10:46.700 --> 10:48.067
we can actually
make it to the end.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.267
- Wait, I'm gonna do more
than just make it to the end,

10:52.267 --> 10:53.233
we're gonna win.

10:53.233 --> 10:55.900
Back in the boat, bitches.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.867
- I've got the
sour apple chutney

10:57.867 --> 10:59.733
and their blood orange
infused olive oil.

10:59.733 --> 11:01.433
- Well, what about
the pickled fig?

11:01.433 --> 11:02.867
- Yes, everything on the
list that you sent through.

11:02.867 --> 11:04.333
- Are you sure?

11:04.333 --> 11:07.067
Because I updated it last
night and this morning

11:07.067 --> 11:08.833
and while you've
been in the shop.

11:08.833 --> 11:09.667
- Oh, how's the wound?

11:09.667 --> 11:11.167
- Sore.

11:11.167 --> 11:12.633
- That is why I want someone
to look at that dressing.

11:12.633 --> 11:13.867
- No, I don't need anyone to.

11:13.867 --> 11:15.500
- Yoo-hoo.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.100
- Don't be mad.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.633
- You gave her a key?

11:20.633 --> 11:22.633
- They don't have anything
on my list here mum,

11:22.633 --> 11:27.633
I need masking tape, crepe
paper, a foot pump and PVC pot.

11:28.500 --> 11:29.433
- Listen to me Danny Bright,

11:29.433 --> 11:30.667
if that wound gets infected

11:30.667 --> 11:31.667
you are looking at
three months of pain

11:31.667 --> 11:32.867
and when I say pain,

11:32.867 --> 11:35.100
I mean you won't be able
to you-know-what me.

11:35.100 --> 11:36.233
- For three months?

11:36.233 --> 11:37.733
- So let Margaret look at it.

11:39.133 --> 11:40.967
Okay, you are gonna need a
news agent to the crepe paper,

11:40.967 --> 11:42.233
did you say a foot pump?

11:42.233 --> 11:44.167
- I told Caspian we need
to get the cheer squad

11:44.167 --> 11:45.733
to Commonwealth games standard,

11:45.733 --> 11:47.433
he came up with a great idea.

11:47.433 --> 11:48.467
- Turn up?

11:48.467 --> 11:50.067
No nanny Margaret

11:50.067 --> 11:50.933
and Christopher Pine will
be thrilled with the support

11:50.933 --> 11:51.933
for the Commonwealth

11:51.933 --> 11:53.467
it's great Oscar,

11:53.467 --> 11:54.767
get whatever you need.

11:56.767 --> 11:58.500
- It's where?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.700
- It's on my above my,

12:01.967 --> 12:02.800
buttocks.

12:04.300 --> 12:05.233
- I said I had to.

12:05.233 --> 12:06.333
- I know.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.933
- What's that?

12:09.933 --> 12:11.200
- Game of Thrones,

12:13.100 --> 12:15.300
do you wanna watch an
episode before you?

12:16.333 --> 12:17.167
- Yes.

12:20.067 --> 12:21.533
- It can be a bit gory.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.800
- Put it on.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.200
- Up, up, up, up,

12:25.133 --> 12:26.400
move it, again.

12:27.767 --> 12:30.533
(rock music)

12:30.533 --> 12:33.200
- Push it push it push it,

12:33.200 --> 12:34.700
yes, yes, move it.

12:39.533 --> 12:40.867
Yes, push, push.

12:44.900 --> 12:48.367
Yes, think Wesley College.

12:48.367 --> 12:52.533
Yes, struck Cana
Baptist, push it.

12:52.533 --> 12:55.900
Presbyterian ladies
give it to them.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.400
It's not time for a break.

12:58.400 --> 13:00.833
- I've had enough
of the exercises.

13:00.833 --> 13:04.100
- You don't get to say
when you've had enough.

13:04.100 --> 13:05.967
- Look, I know you have to
look like you're coaching,

13:05.967 --> 13:07.700
but seriously
you've done enough.

13:07.700 --> 13:09.400
Just take the rest
of the day off.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.800
- Look like I'm coaching?

13:10.800 --> 13:11.900
I am coaching,

13:11.900 --> 13:13.233
this is my job.

13:13.233 --> 13:15.533
- Are we having a break miss?

13:15.533 --> 13:18.500
- Yep come and grab
a chocolate bar,

13:18.500 --> 13:20.733
while Edwina does 50 push-ups,

13:20.733 --> 13:22.333
since she missed
out on the jabs.

13:22.333 --> 13:24.733
(jazz music)

13:28.767 --> 13:30.600
- Now remember, you
can't physically steer

13:30.600 --> 13:32.300
and you have no control

13:32.300 --> 13:33.467
but that's a part of it yeah.

13:33.467 --> 13:34.667
- Hilarious.

13:34.667 --> 13:36.067
- He cut me out this time.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.500
- I'll sit this one out.

13:38.500 --> 13:41.267
- You sat out the
last half dozen.

13:41.267 --> 13:43.167
- Because I was
fired as spotter.

13:43.167 --> 13:45.300
- It's 'cause you left your dad
out in the water five times.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.500
- Four, pretty sure
it was only four.

13:48.500 --> 13:50.800
- Oh, you haven't
had a skate yet?

13:50.800 --> 13:51.933
- I'll have a go later.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.733
- You don't like
the boat, do you?

13:55.733 --> 13:57.167
You're not into
the vintage thing

13:57.167 --> 13:58.433
and you like everything modern,

13:58.433 --> 14:00.167
that's it isn't it?

14:00.167 --> 14:01.800
- No that's not it,

14:01.800 --> 14:02.733
there is no it.

14:02.733 --> 14:03.933
- And why are you avoiding boat?

14:03.933 --> 14:05.233
You're sitting here
reading a dopey magazine

14:05.233 --> 14:06.367
we could be out in the river.

14:06.367 --> 14:07.300
- Fine,

14:07.300 --> 14:08.067
you wanna see me in the boat?

14:08.067 --> 14:09.367
Get in.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.367
Dad, I'm driving.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.900
(boat engine revs)
(rock music)

14:13.900 --> 14:15.267
- Jesus Christ

14:15.267 --> 14:16.667
- Too easy

14:16.667 --> 14:17.500
- Amber.

14:20.433 --> 14:21.267
- Move to the right

14:21.267 --> 14:22.167
- Amber.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.200
(Kayne shouting)

14:24.200 --> 14:27.067
(upbeat music)

14:27.067 --> 14:29.600
(Kayne shouts)

14:31.233 --> 14:32.067
- Stop

14:32.067 --> 14:33.300
- Amber.

14:33.300 --> 14:35.833
(air booms)

14:35.833 --> 14:37.067
- Amber, you blew it up.

14:38.400 --> 14:39.700
- You're right, dad

14:39.700 --> 14:42.567
absolutely no
control whatsoever.

14:42.567 --> 14:43.733
- What were you thinking?

14:43.733 --> 14:46.500
You could have
seriously hurt Kayne.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.667
- Let's look at the
GoPro on my staff.

14:49.667 --> 14:51.167
- That doesn't count,

14:51.167 --> 14:53.833
you know how Kayne contents
danger once he's excited.

14:53.833 --> 14:55.600
- I can't believe you'd be
so reckless in the water.

14:55.600 --> 14:56.567
- And with the boat

14:56.567 --> 14:58.633
imagine how Evan's feeling.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.167
(Evans vomiting)

15:00.167 --> 15:01.533
- We're having fun.

15:01.533 --> 15:04.133
(crowd noises)

15:06.467 --> 15:07.300
- Yeah.

15:12.733 --> 15:16.200
- They can't do
that to Ned Stark,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.467
there must be some mistake,

15:18.467 --> 15:20.867
he's the hero.

15:20.867 --> 15:21.867
- I hate this show.

15:25.167 --> 15:26.167
Another one?

15:27.933 --> 15:29.600
(swords clanging)

15:29.600 --> 15:32.400
- 32nd mark feel the
power of your arms

15:32.400 --> 15:33.500
push through your legs

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
your legs are strong,

15:35.500 --> 15:36.900
52nd mark,

15:36.900 --> 15:39.067
you can feel a massive
surge of energy

15:39.067 --> 15:42.367
like when you slam two Red
Bulls after a really big night

15:42.367 --> 15:45.300
and now you are
Queens on the water.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.700
That had better be a book
on how to win at rowing.

15:50.833 --> 15:53.467
Oh, what a surprise

15:53.467 --> 15:54.700
it's not,

15:54.700 --> 15:56.500
it's about how to
lose at rowing,

15:56.500 --> 15:58.067
by reading instead of training.

15:58.067 --> 15:59.900
- It doesn't matter if we lose.

15:59.900 --> 16:02.133
- Lower your voice.

16:02.133 --> 16:04.333
- I just need the
participation points.

16:04.333 --> 16:06.067
- Participation points?

16:06.067 --> 16:07.500
You're like one of those kids

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
whose mum always praises
them for getting a ribbon

16:09.500 --> 16:11.133
for 10th place,

16:11.133 --> 16:12.400
you're disgusting.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.567
- It's not like it's
anything important,

16:14.567 --> 16:15.967
it's only sport.

16:17.800 --> 16:18.633
- I get it.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.367
- What do you get?

16:21.367 --> 16:23.067
- You aren't trying anything
you can't be the best at

16:23.067 --> 16:24.767
then you can't say you failed.

16:24.767 --> 16:25.867
- That's so not true.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.200
- Remind me what the trophy is.

16:27.200 --> 16:28.600
- The Nancy Drew Smith trophy

16:28.600 --> 16:31.067
for most outstanding
contribution to school life.

16:32.167 --> 16:33.667
- Hiding behind a boat

16:33.667 --> 16:36.100
while your crew
does all the work,

16:36.100 --> 16:37.633
super outstanding,

16:37.633 --> 16:38.633
you're off the team.

16:39.733 --> 16:41.300
- You can't do this to me.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.667
- Doing it.

16:42.667 --> 16:45.467
- Susie Uhm is playing
badminton this weekend

16:45.467 --> 16:47.833
which means she'll have more
participation points than me.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.900
- Someone who is so
keen to participate,

16:50.900 --> 16:53.400
really should have
participated in training.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.100
You're not gonna
let the girls down

16:55.100 --> 16:58.067
Maranda, put the damn
trigonometry down

16:58.067 --> 16:59.533
you're on the team.

16:59.533 --> 17:01.967
(rock music)

17:05.133 --> 17:06.800
- Feeling any better?

17:06.800 --> 17:08.400
- Stomach wise yes.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.900
embarrassment wise, no.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.133
- Shouldn't have scoffed so
much food before you went out.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.800
- Oh, was that the problem?

17:14.800 --> 17:15.733
Or was it that I
was thrown around

17:15.733 --> 17:17.633
like I was in a rinse cycle?

17:17.633 --> 17:19.400
- Nobody else to lump.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.833
- What's the matter with you?

17:21.833 --> 17:22.800
- Nothing's the matter,

17:22.800 --> 17:24.067
you wanted me on the boat

17:24.067 --> 17:25.433
I got on the boat and
you couldn't handle it.

17:25.433 --> 17:26.900
- You couldn't handle it,

17:26.900 --> 17:27.833
you drove it like a maniac
and you destroyed it.

17:27.833 --> 17:29.300
- It's a 40 year old Kingwood

17:29.300 --> 17:30.967
it's called fucking destiny.

17:30.967 --> 17:34.133
- Why are you being so
horrible about my dad's boat?

17:34.133 --> 17:35.200
- Your dad's?

17:35.200 --> 17:37.300
Oh, I thought it was mine,

17:37.300 --> 17:39.133
thought it belonged to me so
I could do what I want with it

17:39.133 --> 17:39.967
but you know what?

17:39.967 --> 17:41.233
Fine, take it back.

17:41.233 --> 17:42.433
- Well if you don't
want it I will.

17:42.433 --> 17:44.500
- Good, it's a pile
of shit anyway.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.200
- I can't talk to you like this.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.300
- That's easily fixed.

17:50.067 --> 17:50.933
- Unlike the boat.

17:51.967 --> 17:54.533
(gentle music)

18:11.067 --> 18:12.967
- Sorry for snoring
so much last night.

18:12.967 --> 18:13.900
- Yeah you probably should
have slept with Julie

18:13.900 --> 18:15.167
and me and Aaron.

18:15.167 --> 18:17.700
Kayne's nasal polyps
really blocking me.

18:17.700 --> 18:20.433
- So fun, couldn't sleep anyway.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.900
- She'll be all right you know?

18:21.900 --> 18:23.167
- I don't know,

18:23.167 --> 18:24.333
we haven't fought
like that before.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.333
- Oh no, I was talking
about the boat.

18:26.333 --> 18:27.700
Amber will still be mental.

18:30.100 --> 18:32.233
(woman chuckles)

18:32.233 --> 18:33.733
- All right big boy

18:34.633 --> 18:36.667
just give me a minute.

18:36.667 --> 18:38.067
Oh, Eddie.

18:38.067 --> 18:39.900
- Please, can you
talk to Brianna?

18:39.900 --> 18:41.867
She's still saying
that I can't race.

18:41.867 --> 18:44.833
- I have told you all due
to the volume of complaints.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.100
I can only interfere
in family disputes

18:47.100 --> 18:48.700
that nanny Margaret has started,

18:48.700 --> 18:50.067
oh, Oscar,

18:50.067 --> 18:51.533
is the cheer squad
meeting early?

18:51.533 --> 18:54.333
- Caspian and I need to test
the pompoms down by the river.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.767
- Oh, maybe Edwina can join you.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.600
- No.
- No.

18:56.600 --> 18:57.867
- She'll spoil it.

18:57.867 --> 18:59.333
- How, from dying
of embarrassment?

18:59.333 --> 19:00.900
- Edwina,

19:00.900 --> 19:03.067
hasn't that arrogance got you
into enough trouble already?

19:03.067 --> 19:05.200
- Oscar I applaud your efforts.

19:05.200 --> 19:06.733
- So what am I supposed to do?

19:06.733 --> 19:08.200
- Sort it out yourself.

19:11.533 --> 19:13.200
- How bad do I need a wash?

19:13.200 --> 19:14.467
Join me for a dip?

19:14.467 --> 19:15.300
- Pass.

19:15.300 --> 19:16.233
You've seen Evan?

19:16.233 --> 19:17.467
- Yeah, he left in his boat.

19:17.467 --> 19:20.300
(water splashing)

19:21.267 --> 19:23.933
(phone ringing)

19:25.467 --> 19:26.600
- Danny's not answering,

19:26.600 --> 19:28.333
I'll try mum again.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.167
(phone vibrates)

19:29.167 --> 19:31.567
(mum snoring)

19:31.567 --> 19:33.433
(Margret coughs)

19:33.433 --> 19:34.267
(hand slaps)

19:34.267 --> 19:35.100
- It's Bess

19:36.233 --> 19:37.733
- Hello?

19:37.733 --> 19:38.767
- Are you all right?

19:38.767 --> 19:40.067
I've been trying to reach Danny.

19:40.067 --> 19:42.167
- He's fine he's been sleeping.

19:42.167 --> 19:43.367
- You're with him now,

19:43.367 --> 19:44.933
again?

19:44.933 --> 19:45.767
Is he all right,

19:45.767 --> 19:46.700
how's the wound?

19:46.700 --> 19:47.800
- I haven't checked it yet,

19:48.967 --> 19:51.633
this morning, yes,
it's healing nicely.

19:51.633 --> 19:52.900
- Right, okay

19:52.900 --> 19:53.967
well tell Danny that I'm
on my way to the winery

19:53.967 --> 19:55.233
for the rest of his list

19:55.233 --> 19:56.633
and can he please
stop updating it?

19:56.633 --> 19:58.100
- Good, I have to go, bye.

19:59.100 --> 20:00.067
Season three.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.533
- Warm up started five
minutes ago Chloe,

20:04.533 --> 20:06.033
what is that?

20:06.033 --> 20:07.867
- I fell out of the bunk
bed and sprained my thumb.

20:07.867 --> 20:10.800
I literally can't move it.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.400
(metal bangs)

20:13.400 --> 20:14.933
- You got lucky.

20:14.933 --> 20:17.233
- Two more glasses
of the Pelorus wine.

20:17.233 --> 20:18.967
- And we all have
two more wheels

20:18.967 --> 20:20.867
of that cheese to wash it down.

20:20.867 --> 20:21.700
(Julie laughing)

20:21.700 --> 20:23.667
(phone beeps)

20:23.667 --> 20:25.800
- Edwina is back in the race,

20:25.800 --> 20:27.033
oh we should head back.

20:27.033 --> 20:29.367
- Sweetheart, could we
have those wheels to go?

20:29.367 --> 20:30.633
Evan.

20:30.633 --> 20:32.167
- Evan, hi,

20:32.167 --> 20:33.400
where's Amber?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.233
- Oh, setting fire to
a heritage building,

20:35.233 --> 20:37.667
slashing the seats
of an old Mercedes,

20:37.667 --> 20:39.567
blowing up an antique store.

20:39.567 --> 20:40.667
- You still mad at her?

20:42.533 --> 20:44.267
I see how that was
a dumb question.

20:47.033 --> 20:48.167
- Frank fix the engine?

20:49.100 --> 20:49.933
- He's amazing,

20:49.933 --> 20:50.800
terrible polyps,

20:50.800 --> 20:52.333
great heads.

20:52.333 --> 20:54.400
- Amber is very lucky that
Cane came to the rescue,

20:54.400 --> 20:55.800
did she apologize?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.400
- That was a dumb
question too Julie.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.067
- No no, she will
be apologizing after

21:01.067 --> 21:03.433
what she did to
your beautiful boat.

21:03.433 --> 21:04.667
- No, her beautiful boat.

21:04.667 --> 21:05.633
- What do you mean?

21:05.633 --> 21:06.600
- I gave it to her.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.133
- That explains why.

21:10.133 --> 21:11.900
- Oh, if only I'd known.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.067
- I don't get what
the big deal is.

21:13.067 --> 21:14.467
- You gave her
your father's boat.

21:14.467 --> 21:16.633
- That is a big commitment.

21:16.633 --> 21:18.200
- Okay, so?

21:18.200 --> 21:20.167
- Amber is terrified
of commitment.

21:20.167 --> 21:22.400
- She's terrified of the only
commitment she's ever known,

21:22.400 --> 21:23.867
Troy.
- Troy.

21:23.867 --> 21:25.133
- What's Troy got to do with me?

21:25.133 --> 21:27.967
- For 17 years he
promised her something

21:27.967 --> 21:28.933
and then took it away,

21:28.933 --> 21:30.767
he said one thing did another,

21:30.767 --> 21:32.933
he told her that
he would get a job,

21:32.933 --> 21:34.800
pay for Sean, buy a house

21:34.800 --> 21:35.867
never did.

21:35.867 --> 21:37.800
- So, when you gave her the boat

21:37.800 --> 21:39.833
she is just waiting for
you to take it away.

21:39.833 --> 21:41.633
- And that's just what I did,

21:41.633 --> 21:42.533
took it away.

21:45.067 --> 21:46.667
I'm gonna go.

21:46.667 --> 21:47.933
- Yeah we should go too,

21:47.933 --> 21:49.167
we've got a support
Edwina and Ariana.

21:51.333 --> 21:53.633
- You two all right
to drive back?

21:53.633 --> 21:57.167
(boat engine roaring)

21:57.167 --> 21:59.700
(upbeat music)

22:06.467 --> 22:09.167
(indistinct)

22:09.167 --> 22:11.067
- How's the sprained thumb?

22:11.067 --> 22:13.433
What did Edwina
offer for your spot?

22:13.433 --> 22:15.133
- She'd do my humanities essay,

22:16.100 --> 22:17.067
please don't say anything

22:17.067 --> 22:18.700
I could actually pass this year.

22:20.100 --> 22:22.100
- Who's that chick that's
gonna get the trophy?

22:22.100 --> 22:24.600
Susie something,
plays badminton.

22:24.600 --> 22:25.633
- Susie Uhm?

22:26.833 --> 22:28.733
- Girls, it's a drainer

22:28.733 --> 22:31.800
that we don't have Chloe's
vast experience in the boat

22:31.800 --> 22:33.933
because of her thumb

22:33.933 --> 22:36.433
but she can still help
us out if she's the cox.

22:36.433 --> 22:38.267
Maranda, get out,

22:38.267 --> 22:39.633
Chloe.

22:39.633 --> 22:42.067
- I'm going to be encouraging
you all to push hard

22:42.067 --> 22:43.367
so that we can continue

22:43.367 --> 22:47.067
Throssington Graham's
incredible success this weekend.

22:47.067 --> 22:49.367
We just found out Susie Uhm

22:49.367 --> 22:51.467
won state championships
for badminton.

22:56.233 --> 22:57.700
- Why are you taking that off?

22:58.900 --> 23:00.300
- Are you going
back to Melbourne?

23:00.300 --> 23:01.100
- By boat?

23:01.100 --> 23:02.567
Yeah, that was the plan

23:02.567 --> 23:03.900
but I remembered how the
Murray had paid us out into

23:03.900 --> 23:05.967
that salt flat in
South Australia.

23:05.967 --> 23:07.167
I just wasn't sure
about how regular

23:07.167 --> 23:08.500
the buses were from there.

23:10.700 --> 23:11.833
- We have to win,

23:11.833 --> 23:12.833
we can't just finish,

23:12.833 --> 23:14.400
we have to win,

23:14.400 --> 23:16.933
there's a humanities essay
in it for everyone if we.

23:16.933 --> 23:17.900
(gun bangs)

23:17.900 --> 23:18.733
- Go.

23:20.100 --> 23:21.200
- Let's go

23:21.200 --> 23:22.267
let's go Throssington

23:22.267 --> 23:23.333
let's go

23:23.333 --> 23:24.167
let's go Throssington

23:24.167 --> 23:25.067
let's go

23:26.200 --> 23:28.800
- I'm sorry for
what I did, really.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.067
I don't think this is gonna work

23:30.067 --> 23:32.067
maybe we should hook it
up to my dad's truck?

23:33.067 --> 23:34.100
- It's your boat

23:34.100 --> 23:35.267
I gave it to you

23:35.267 --> 23:36.733
you may not wanna use it yet,

23:38.067 --> 23:39.100
ever,

23:39.100 --> 23:40.333
well I'm not taking it back.

23:40.333 --> 23:41.433
- 'Cause I wrecked it?

23:42.467 --> 23:44.233
- 'Cause it's yours.

23:44.233 --> 23:45.833
- Guy throw the tie

23:45.833 --> 23:48.600
(crowd cheering)

23:50.400 --> 23:51.333
- Come on.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.100
- If Susie Uhm can win,

23:53.100 --> 23:53.933
so can we.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.100
Susie Uhm,

23:55.100 --> 23:55.900
Susie Uhm.

23:57.067 --> 23:58.300
- I know you're scared

23:58.300 --> 23:59.567
I'm not Troy.

23:59.567 --> 24:01.267
- I know you're
not fucking Troy.

24:01.267 --> 24:02.200
- You've got a bank account

24:02.200 --> 24:03.367
and an IQ in double digits,

24:03.367 --> 24:04.200
shit.

24:05.433 --> 24:07.433
You being Troy is
not the problem,

24:07.433 --> 24:08.900
me being me is.

24:10.233 --> 24:12.400
Troy is a useless
dickhead his entire life,

24:12.400 --> 24:15.600
until we broke up and
now he's got a job

24:15.600 --> 24:19.700
and he's cooking and
building happy houses.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.200
Why couldn't he do
any of that for me?

24:26.900 --> 24:28.467
- Hard,

24:28.467 --> 24:30.533
don't let a spotlight
in badminton beat you,

24:30.533 --> 24:31.467
Edwina

24:31.467 --> 24:32.800
how embarrassing,

24:32.800 --> 24:33.667
pull.

24:33.667 --> 24:34.500
- Let go.

24:35.500 --> 24:36.800
(crowd cheering)

24:36.800 --> 24:40.233
- I've never seen
her move like that.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.233
- I said, pull,

24:41.233 --> 24:42.267
come on.

24:42.267 --> 24:43.500
- Let's go Throssington.

24:43.500 --> 24:44.833
let's go

24:44.833 --> 24:46.167
let's go Throssington

24:46.167 --> 24:47.400
let's go

24:47.400 --> 24:49.600
- You and Troy weren't
right for each other

24:49.600 --> 24:51.900
but you kept trying to
make him right for you

24:51.900 --> 24:52.733
'cause of Shawn,

24:54.867 --> 24:56.667
and that's why I'm
in love with you.

24:58.633 --> 25:00.933
- You are?

25:00.933 --> 25:02.467
- Yeah,

25:02.467 --> 25:03.967
and also cause you're hot.

25:03.967 --> 25:05.933
(woman laughing)

25:05.933 --> 25:08.700
(fireball booms)

25:11.067 --> 25:13.367
(fireball booms)

25:13.367 --> 25:15.167
- Pompom fireballs.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.533
- Shot out of a cannon

25:16.533 --> 25:18.300
wicked old man.

25:18.300 --> 25:20.400
(fireball booms)

25:20.400 --> 25:22.067
(upbeat music)

25:22.067 --> 25:23.433
- No, no, no, no.

25:24.933 --> 25:26.833
- Edwina, are you okay?

25:28.800 --> 25:29.633
- Did we win?

25:33.533 --> 25:35.933
(horn honks)

25:37.067 --> 25:38.800
- We didn't finish?

25:38.800 --> 25:41.133
(crowd cheering)

25:41.133 --> 25:43.633
- I agree, it was
very irresponsible

25:43.633 --> 25:45.200
but in their defense,

25:45.200 --> 25:46.433
did you see the opening

25:46.433 --> 25:48.200
of the Commonwealth
games in Glasgow?

25:51.067 --> 25:52.100
- I think I've torn a muscle.

25:52.100 --> 25:53.200
- Which one?

25:53.200 --> 25:54.267
- All of them.

25:54.267 --> 25:55.767
- Sorry for pushing you so hard.

25:55.767 --> 25:57.300
- Sorry for being a prat,

25:57.300 --> 25:58.233
I should have tried in training.

25:58.233 --> 26:00.067
- Well, you tried in the race.

26:00.067 --> 26:01.367
- We still couldn't finish.

26:01.367 --> 26:02.800
- There's always next year.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.400
- Next year, that
trophy isn't mine,

26:04.400 --> 26:05.533
I'm doing badminton

26:05.533 --> 26:07.067
I mean if Susie Uhm can win.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.633
- Oh yeah, about that,

26:08.633 --> 26:12.133
I may have not told you the
exact truth about Susie Uhm.

26:12.133 --> 26:14.967
(people laughing)

26:18.233 --> 26:20.067
(boat engine revs)

26:20.067 --> 26:21.800
(woman laughing)

26:21.800 --> 26:23.833
(upbeat music)

26:23.833 --> 26:25.333
(horse neighing)

26:25.333 --> 26:27.067
- The White Walkers are coming.

26:28.500 --> 26:30.667
No, I burst my stitches,

26:30.667 --> 26:31.633
ha, ha,

26:31.633 --> 26:32.467
- Ow, ow,

26:32.467 --> 26:33.533
Danny

26:33.533 --> 26:34.300
(Margaret screams)
Danny.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.900
(upbeat music)

27:02.700 --> 27:05.533
(car engine revs)
