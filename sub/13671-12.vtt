WEBVTT

00:01.680 --> 00:03.880
You'll enjoy this.

00:03.880 --> 00:07.560
I got all this violence.
Why I didn't fight back harder.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.800
They will not let me
return to Russia.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.520
It's three years
since I've seen
my husband.

00:13.520 --> 00:17.120
You and Yuri can stay here
until you find a place.

00:17.120 --> 00:18.760
Vietnam was a mistake.

00:18.760 --> 00:21.640
Don't say my brother
died for no reason.

00:21.640 --> 00:24.720
You tried sandbagging me.
That only happens once.

00:24.720 --> 00:26.200
We'll have to
start dating.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.520
You were the top
residency pick.

00:28.520 --> 00:32.520
You've started off poorly.

02:02.000 --> 02:02.920
             Move it!

02:02.920 --> 02:04.880
             Move it!
Watch it, now!

02:04.880 --> 02:07.440
Come on, tighten it up!

02:07.440 --> 02:11.080
Nobody fall back.

02:11.080 --> 02:15.080
Wide awake.
Nobody fall back.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.080
PING

02:17.080 --> 02:18.320
             I'm hit!

02:18.320 --> 02:19.960
       Behind those rocks!

02:19.960 --> 02:21.920
Dig in! Move it!

02:21.920 --> 02:25.920
Keep your heads down.

02:27.520 --> 02:28.000
Victor!

02:28.000 --> 02:29.680
Victor!
Watch yourself.

02:29.680 --> 02:33.680
We'll never get
out of here alive.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.160
              Yuri, here we are.

02:35.160 --> 02:38.680
St Elegius, a well-oiled
medical machine.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.160
This man outside
begging for money,

02:42.160 --> 02:44.880
he's one of
your many homeless?

02:44.880 --> 02:47.640
For all I know, he has
a house in Marblehead.

02:47.640 --> 02:49.080
                 Any messages for me?

02:49.080 --> 02:51.440
Busy, huh?

02:51.440 --> 02:53.680
         Here. I'll say.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.120
              Look at this.

02:55.120 --> 02:59.120
Looks like everyone's heart
went kaplooey at once.

03:01.520 --> 03:03.440
When is my license
approved?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.800
                        What's that?

03:05.800 --> 03:08.400
Uh, to practice surgery.
My license.

03:08.400 --> 03:12.200
Oh. Well, you see, the board
of registration

03:12.200 --> 03:14.280
can be very slow
about these things.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.160
They're a bunch of
petty bureaucrats.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.680
But Josiah Bartlett
is a friend of mine.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.040
He'll push your approval
straight through.

03:21.040 --> 03:25.040
                         Here we are.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.560
I'm out of practice,

03:29.560 --> 03:32.720
the two years I spent
on the assembly line,
building tractors.

03:32.720 --> 03:36.360
A pioneer in Russian cardiovascular
laser surgery,

03:36.360 --> 03:38.440
forced to manufacture farm equipment.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.040
              It's terrible.

03:40.040 --> 03:41.760
You're right.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.280
Come on, Mrs Ditko,
you won't die.

03:44.280 --> 03:47.080
Masha and I fought
all the way from the airport.

03:47.080 --> 03:50.200
She started all the troubles
with her protests.

03:50.200 --> 03:54.200
And then the Soviet
officials just
forced her to emigrate.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.760
I tried to get her back
to the Soviet Union.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.160
Two months ago,
they returned me
to my hospital.

04:01.160 --> 04:05.160
I was so happy,
at my laser,
helping people.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.600
Then the word comes,
"You can go to US,

04:09.600 --> 04:13.600
and I must choose between
my work, my wife...

04:14.880 --> 04:16.800
both of which I love.

04:16.800 --> 04:20.800
I said you'd get
your license, didn't I?

04:25.640 --> 04:29.640
Oh, for the love of...
Mikhail.

04:29.920 --> 04:31.400
Mr And Mrs Gillette?

04:31.400 --> 04:32.440
Yeah

04:32.440 --> 04:33.880
Dr Turner,
head of obstetrics.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.000
I'm here for a consult.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.440
Obstetrics? But my wife only fainted.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.520
Because she's pregnant.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.480
Can't be.

04:42.480 --> 04:43.920
Can't be.
It could be.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.560
You are.

04:45.560 --> 04:47.200
Well?

04:47.200 --> 04:51.200
Well, all right!

04:52.200 --> 04:54.040
How far along?

04:54.040 --> 04:56.600
20 weeks.

04:56.600 --> 04:58.560
My periods
have been irregular.

04:58.560 --> 05:01.400
I even took
a home pregnancy test.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.960
It came out negative.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.200
Those aren't 100% accurate.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.040
          Why did Gail black out?

05:07.040 --> 05:09.200
She's slightly anaemic.

05:09.200 --> 05:12.120
We got to get you
on a proper diet -

05:12.120 --> 05:15.840
vitamins,
lots of rest...a kid!

05:15.840 --> 05:17.200
Mr And Mrs Gillette,

05:17.200 --> 05:19.600
I'd like to perform
an amniocentesis -

05:19.600 --> 05:23.200
withdraw a sample
of the amniotic fluid
for examination.

05:23.200 --> 05:24.360
Something's wrong?

05:24.360 --> 05:25.720
Your initial blood test

05:25.720 --> 05:28.520
showed elevated levels
of Rh antibody.

05:28.520 --> 05:30.000
In simplest terms,

05:30.000 --> 05:33.400
Gail's blood
and the baby's blood
are not compatible.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.800
The two
are fighting it out.

05:35.800 --> 05:39.800
And right now,
the baby's losing.

05:49.360 --> 05:51.760
Hey! Messed up my knot.

05:51.760 --> 05:54.600
I picked up something - a fungus, a
rash.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.080
Stay away from me.

05:56.080 --> 05:57.520
Sure. Have a yuk.

05:57.520 --> 06:01.520
You don't have to do
crusty skin rotations
in Dermatology.

06:01.800 --> 06:04.200
I'm not doing
a rotation anywhere.

06:04.200 --> 06:06.160
I'm Mr 50-50,
half-orderly,

06:06.160 --> 06:08.080
half physician's
assistant-in-training.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.520
But I do look good.

06:09.520 --> 06:13.520
Moriasis rosia,
got to be.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.800
Tough time answering
the bell today.

06:25.800 --> 06:29.720
My son streaked his hair
like that for Halloween.

06:29.720 --> 06:33.480
It's a girlfriend's
idea of a joke. She did it
while I slept.

06:33.480 --> 06:37.440
I haven't taken
a shower yet.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.840
Mr Mildaur had
a rough night, too.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.600
Let's up him
to 10 milligrams
Valium IV.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.080
Please write instructions
on the chart.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.720
Helen, would you
DC Miss Reams?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.080
No problem.

06:49.080 --> 06:52.280
What? Word of mouth's
good enough for her?

06:52.280 --> 06:55.200
You and I have
had our problems
communicating.

06:55.200 --> 06:57.120
If you write
everything down,

06:57.120 --> 07:01.120
there won't be
any misunderstanding.

07:03.840 --> 07:06.720
I've got to
get back on top
with Rosenthal.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.600
Tough climb
for a guy like you.

07:09.600 --> 07:13.600
Nice coif.

07:19.880 --> 07:22.520
          You just missed Helen.

07:22.520 --> 07:25.400
She left her wallet
on the car seat.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.200
Could you
give this to her?

07:27.200 --> 07:29.280
              Sure. You grew a beard.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.600
The only place
I can grow hair.

07:32.600 --> 07:35.800
Listen...

07:35.800 --> 07:38.200
Helen told me
about the walk-out.

07:38.200 --> 07:41.080
Your divorce. Sorry.
I'm a federal mediator.

07:41.080 --> 07:44.440
Well, there will be
no negotiations
in this dispute.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.160
Robert
met someone else.
Looks like a merger.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.440
Too bad.

07:48.440 --> 07:51.280
Mates lose interest.
Stare at you one day,

07:51.280 --> 07:53.480
wishing they saw
someone else.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.000
When I was married,

07:55.000 --> 07:58.760
I kept the sports page
in front of my face.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.760
See you.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.960
     Come on, yellow team!

08:07.960 --> 08:09.400
What about the reds?

08:09.400 --> 08:11.680
They've retreated
to defend their flag.

08:11.680 --> 08:13.680
How are you so sure?

08:13.680 --> 08:14.920
Know your enemy, Chandler.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.000
They're accountants.
They'll cut their
losses and run.

08:18.000 --> 08:21.480
We doctors from
the Inner Hospital Squad

08:21.480 --> 08:24.600
will excise them
with surgical precision.

08:24.600 --> 08:27.240
Now come on.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.800
And don't forget -

08:29.800 --> 08:32.720
if you're captured,
they get ten points,

08:32.720 --> 08:35.600
so it's better
to get shot for five.

08:35.600 --> 08:36.720
Or escape?

08:36.720 --> 08:39.120
I had a spicy
chorizo earlier.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.520
You lower GIs stink.

08:41.520 --> 08:43.919
Whoa!
Friendly forces.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.800
You really
take this seriously.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.720
I thought we were
just playing a game.

08:48.720 --> 08:50.160
It's no big deal,

08:50.160 --> 08:53.040
just competition,
planned strategy.

08:53.040 --> 08:55.880
A chance to blow out
that pent-up testosterone,

08:55.880 --> 08:58.040
see what you miss
not being Audie Murphy.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.320
We're shooting at people.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.040
         Yeah. With paint pellets.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.240
         Yeah. With paint pellets.
Hey, it's the whole idea.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.880
This is pretending
to kill other human beings.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.360
We're just
letting off steam.

09:07.360 --> 09:09.000
         We're doctors.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.280
Exactly. All smiles
and bedside manner.

09:11.280 --> 09:12.880
We need a release.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.440
Not Boomer.
He never gets revved.

09:15.440 --> 09:19.320
We spent a night getting
a bullet from Wayne's chest.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.600
I know.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.520
Your brother died
in Vietnam.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.320
Doesn't glorifying
battle bother you?

09:24.320 --> 09:27.600
You know, you're the one
taking this too seriously.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.120
Let's split up.

09:29.120 --> 09:31.480
Chandler, you're with me.

09:31.480 --> 09:33.360
Should we buddy
with you?

09:33.360 --> 09:37.360
             Nah.

09:43.680 --> 09:47.680
Get this filled,
and take the iron
supplement daily.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.080
And the Rh problem?

09:50.080 --> 09:54.080
It's genetic.
There's nothing
you could have done.

09:56.800 --> 09:57.920
                       Any word?

09:57.920 --> 10:01.920
Results of the amnio
still aren't back.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.920
All they have
in the gift shop

10:04.920 --> 10:08.280
are chocolates,
flowers, and stuffies.

10:08.280 --> 10:09.400
That's cute.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.320
What are you
looking for?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.720
Literature
for the baby.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.600
A little
prenatal preschool.

10:16.600 --> 10:19.480
Like your sister Claire
did with William?

10:19.480 --> 10:21.400
     That baby is a wizard.

10:21.400 --> 10:25.240
You. I'm going
to read you the classics -

10:25.240 --> 10:27.640
     the Iliad, the Odyssey,

10:27.640 --> 10:30.520
Ted Williams's
Art of Hitting.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.360
We'll listen to music,
we'll talk...

10:34.360 --> 10:35.800
         Well, I'll talk.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.720
We've still got
five months

10:37.720 --> 10:40.880
before you graduate
from the womb.

10:40.880 --> 10:43.440
Hatching
superbaby, huh?

10:43.440 --> 10:46.320
Competition for
the top schools is rough.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.320
     Boston Latin, Yale...

10:51.000 --> 10:52.400
         My child will have

10:52.400 --> 10:56.400
the educational
opportunities I never had.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.280
Here you go, Dr Turner.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.680
Oh, Dr Auschlander
is looking for you.

11:01.680 --> 11:05.400
Need some help
with that?

11:05.400 --> 11:08.880
             Thanks.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.800
It's just as I thought.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.200
The amnio results indicate

11:12.200 --> 11:15.440
we should do a foetal transfusion
as soon as possible.

11:15.440 --> 11:17.440
That operation
you mentioned.

11:17.440 --> 11:20.160
I'll insert a needle
through the womb

11:20.160 --> 11:22.960
and replace the baby's blood
with Rh negative.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.240
Well, what
are the risks?

11:25.240 --> 11:28.080
Infection, stimulating labour,
fatal injury to the...

11:28.080 --> 11:29.920
There must be
some other way.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.840
Too much of the baby's blood
has been destroyed.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.920
Oh, yeah?

11:35.920 --> 11:39.920
Well, I want
a second opinion.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.480
Of course.

11:45.480 --> 11:47.560
I can recommend
another doctor...

11:47.560 --> 11:51.560
I can find one
on my own. Thanks.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.400
Could you excuse us?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.840
                       I missed.

12:01.840 --> 12:05.520
That guy's tough to get.

12:05.520 --> 12:08.080
Your brother
was in Nam, huh?

12:08.080 --> 12:12.080
                       Yeah.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.240
                   Son of a gun.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.040
Real thing
must be terrifying.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.720
Nathan sent
lots of letters.

12:17.720 --> 12:21.720
He hated most
those VC tunnels,

12:21.720 --> 12:23.400
just wide enough
for a man.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.120
Someone had to go in
and flush out the enemy.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.960
They sent him in
a couple of times,

12:27.960 --> 12:30.760
knife in his teeth,
.45 in his hand,

12:30.760 --> 12:33.680
no room
to move around,

12:33.680 --> 12:36.120
dark, dirty...

12:36.120 --> 12:40.080
didn't know if Charlie
was in there,

12:40.080 --> 12:44.080
waiting.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.400
I had him wide open
and missed him.

12:48.400 --> 12:52.400
How did your brother
handle that place?

12:52.800 --> 12:54.960
Nathan had big ones,
you know?

12:54.960 --> 12:58.960
When his draft number
came up, he was gone,

12:59.000 --> 13:03.000
no two ways about it.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.040
The only call
I would have heard

13:05.040 --> 13:09.040
was the Canadian goose.

13:12.160 --> 13:14.200
His first letters
he sent home

13:14.200 --> 13:17.960
were full of glory stories,
souvenirs.

13:17.960 --> 13:19.760
Then, after six months,

13:19.760 --> 13:23.000
before he was killed
in Khe Sanh,

13:23.000 --> 13:27.000
he sent the family
a letter.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.240
"Dear Mom, Dad, Phil...

13:31.240 --> 13:35.120
"I love you."

13:35.120 --> 13:38.680
"I love you."

13:38.680 --> 13:42.360
That's all he wrote.

13:42.360 --> 13:45.640
"I love you."

13:45.640 --> 13:48.000
I love you.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
SHOUTS WAR CRY

13:54.120 --> 13:56.720
          CCU, cardiac care unit.

13:56.720 --> 14:00.720
State-of-the-art patient
life-support systems.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.120
Mr Kuell
had near total occlusion

14:03.120 --> 14:06.200
of his left main
coronary artery.

14:06.200 --> 14:10.040
Coronary bypass
prevented a fatal
myocardial infarction.

14:10.040 --> 14:13.160
Laser angioscopy
can achieve
the same results

14:13.160 --> 14:14.600
without
the major surgery.

14:14.600 --> 14:18.120
                       True.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.400
SUSTAINED BEEP

14:20.400 --> 14:21.560
Get that cart here.

14:21.560 --> 14:25.560
Get that cart here.
                        Yes, doctor.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.600
Oh, Donald!

14:32.600 --> 14:35.720
This is
Dr Yuri Peltrovitch.

14:35.720 --> 14:38.840
How do you do?
Donald Westphall. How's the tour?

14:38.840 --> 14:40.480
Actually,
I've got patients.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.200
In Moscow,
one of the local
cardiology clinics

14:43.200 --> 14:46.560
is on the top floor
of a five-story walk-up,

14:46.560 --> 14:49.480
and if patients make it up
all those stairs,

14:49.480 --> 14:52.520
doctors say,
"You're fine. Go home."

14:52.520 --> 14:55.320
Sounds like Boston
city planning.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.920
Uh, I don't
understand.

14:57.920 --> 15:00.800
Uh, short on funding
and logic.

15:00.800 --> 15:02.640
Oh. It's so strange.

15:02.640 --> 15:06.280
I see such abundance,
efficiency, care.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.680
And in Russia, we don't
have enough antibiotics,

15:08.680 --> 15:11.320
bandages, cotton.

15:11.320 --> 15:14.320
What Soviet doctors
could do with your garbage!

15:14.320 --> 15:15.840
Look. Tell Donald
about it.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.600
I'll review
surgery reports.

15:17.600 --> 15:20.600
Share some of
your sob stories
about Ethiopia.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.720
Dr Craig.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.120
I'm looking forward
working with him.

15:24.120 --> 15:25.480
It's a different breed.

15:25.480 --> 15:26.680
It's...

15:26.680 --> 15:28.600
Pit bull.

15:28.600 --> 15:32.480
Come on.

15:32.480 --> 15:34.840
I'm glad
you came back.

15:34.840 --> 15:37.240
I couldn't get
United Folding Chair

15:37.240 --> 15:39.640
to sit at
the bargaining table.

15:39.640 --> 15:41.440
Can't pass up an eclair.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.800
I'm watching my weight.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.200
Excuse me, guys.

15:45.200 --> 15:49.200
Thank you.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.280
Join me for lunch?

15:57.280 --> 15:58.720
Uh...sure.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.720
I've got to get
another shot
of Phisohex first.

16:10.920 --> 16:14.280
                  Jackie.

16:14.280 --> 16:18.280
            It has your name on it.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.200
Why are you
mad at me?

16:26.200 --> 16:28.760
I just think
you have a scruple loose.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.280
Everybody has me
pegged for a jerk.

16:31.280 --> 16:34.000
I booted the pooch
a couple of times,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.240
but what's a guy got to do
around here

16:36.240 --> 16:38.880
to get
a second chance?

16:38.880 --> 16:40.320
             Hi, Helen.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.760
    Hey. How you doing?

16:41.760 --> 16:42.720
Nice guy.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.680
Mm-hmm.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.120
Met him earlier.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.040
Thinks the world
of you.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.480
And on, and on.

16:48.480 --> 16:50.880
What a great
nurse you are.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.240
How lovely...
Guy's hot for you.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.320
Twit.

16:55.320 --> 16:58.800
In my profession, what's unsaid is
often most important.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.960
When it comes to
expressing wants,

17:00.960 --> 17:04.359
I've learned to read
the small, unspoken signals.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.200
He's a boy.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.000
You're not
attracted to him?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.680
Seth? Well,
he's in good shape.

17:10.680 --> 17:12.079
Got great hair.

17:12.079 --> 17:14.000
And looks like
Michelangelo's David.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.040
Yes, he does.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.359
And what about me?

17:18.359 --> 17:20.800
What do you see when you stare
across the table?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.200
Sauce on your tie.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.560
Oh.

17:26.560 --> 17:28.319
Just as I thought.

17:28.319 --> 17:32.200
I'm nothing more than one of those
pathetic, bald, middle-aged men,

17:32.200 --> 17:35.600
who drool

17:35.600 --> 17:39.600
Pass the salt.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.280
It's great
being outdoors.

17:47.280 --> 17:50.680
Boomer, if you don't
want to be here,
you can leave.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.320
You don't have to fight.

17:52.320 --> 17:55.960
If you stay,
I think you'll need this.

17:55.960 --> 17:57.200
Just great.

17:57.200 --> 18:01.200
Stevie Hill used
to beat the snot
out of me

18:02.040 --> 18:03.640
every day
after school.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.040
Even if
I came late,

18:06.040 --> 18:09.480
changed my route,
turned the corner,
there he'd be.

18:09.480 --> 18:11.120
Had the same
problem.

18:11.120 --> 18:12.480
How did you
handle it?

18:12.480 --> 18:13.960
Worked out a system.

18:13.960 --> 18:17.680
Every week, I'd mail my milk money
to the class bully.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.160
I never fought back.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.480
My father tried
to teach me to box.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.920
When I'd see Stevie,

18:23.920 --> 18:26.760
I couldn't even
block his punches.

18:26.760 --> 18:30.760
One time, at
the kitchen table...

18:31.120 --> 18:35.120
..my mother was cleaning
my bloody lip with a dishtowel.

18:35.880 --> 18:39.080
My father came
home from work...

18:39.080 --> 18:42.760
stared at me,
shook his head.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.040
As he walked
out of the room,

18:45.040 --> 18:48.840
I heard him say,
"pansy."

18:48.840 --> 18:49.920
Nice guy.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.800
Parents want
their kids strong.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.440
They want them able to
defend themselves.

18:55.440 --> 18:59.440
I don't know.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.600
Doing my community
service work at
Newcastle prison,

19:02.600 --> 19:04.240
I allowed myself
to get raped.

19:04.240 --> 19:07.120
How much do you take
before you strike back?

19:07.120 --> 19:10.400
You think fighting Nick Moats
would've done any good?

19:10.400 --> 19:14.400
FOOTSTEPS

19:15.000 --> 19:16.200
Did you guys quit?

19:16.200 --> 19:18.880
We stopped before we went
a bridge too far.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.160
Oh. Morrison.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.120
You go that way.

19:24.120 --> 19:28.120
Ehrlich...

19:28.880 --> 19:30.400
Right here. Here.

19:30.400 --> 19:34.400
Cover your head
with it.

19:40.280 --> 19:44.280
Shot anyone yet,
Ehrlich?

19:50.120 --> 19:51.160
KNOCK ON DOOR

19:51.160 --> 19:53.160
KNOCK ON DOOR
Come in.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.080
Here I am.
What's up?

19:55.080 --> 19:58.440
Your patient,
Gail Gillette.

19:58.440 --> 20:00.360
They wanted
a second opinion.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.880
Dr Glenn agrees
with my diagnosis,

20:02.880 --> 20:05.240
so she's scheduled
for an in vivo transfusion

20:05.240 --> 20:07.360
after I grab
a cheeseburger.

20:07.360 --> 20:08.800
Want some tea?

20:08.800 --> 20:10.400
Yes.

20:10.400 --> 20:14.200
You're aware this hospital
subscribes to a consulting service

20:14.200 --> 20:16.120
that alerts us
to those patients

20:16.120 --> 20:19.720
who've filed malpractice
suits in the past.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.520
I got the memo.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.520
The Gillettes are suing
an entire surgical team

20:24.520 --> 20:26.800
at the Immaculata
hospital in Baltimore

20:26.800 --> 20:28.400
         for ¤3 million.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.480
That's a lot
of Whipout.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.080
                   The point is,

20:32.080 --> 20:36.080
hospital trustees
are skittish about
litigious patients.

20:36.960 --> 20:40.960
I would suggest that you explain this
operation carefully to the couple.

20:42.320 --> 20:46.320
Make certain that all proper
consent forms are signed.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.200
         And if possible,

20:48.200 --> 20:52.200
get your conversation
with them on tape.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.000
Even if I do...

20:57.000 --> 20:59.880
Daniel, this is
a risky procedure.

20:59.880 --> 21:02.720
I can't possibly
cover every angle

21:02.720 --> 21:06.720
or eliminate
the dangers.

21:07.920 --> 21:09.680
              As an obstetrician,

21:09.680 --> 21:11.520
your malpractice
premiums

21:11.520 --> 21:13.440
are the highest
in our profession.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.200
              A sizeable lawsuit

21:15.200 --> 21:19.200
could seriously
affect your future
ability to practice.

21:20.800 --> 21:24.800
I'll explain everything
to the Gillettes again.

21:26.920 --> 21:30.920
There's a computer
service of patients, too.

21:30.920 --> 21:34.640
It lists all the doctors in America
who've been sued for malpractice.

21:34.640 --> 21:38.640
We don't want you
winding up on that list.

21:40.240 --> 21:44.240
               Please. Look around.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.160
Mark Craig
has guided this
surgical department

21:52.160 --> 21:54.840
               into the modern era.

21:54.840 --> 21:58.360
Bypass machine.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.760
This is
the ultra station.

22:00.760 --> 22:02.240
         This is amazing.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.120
Once you've started
operating here,

22:04.120 --> 22:06.080
you'll wonder
how you managed

22:06.080 --> 22:07.680
without these
wonderful tools.

22:07.680 --> 22:09.920
You have 14
operating rooms here.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.840
Why is this one idle?

22:11.840 --> 22:15.840
We can be saving lives
right now.

22:16.360 --> 22:19.520
Mark, for me,
this is a utopia.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.840
What's the matter?
Trouble with a patient?

22:21.840 --> 22:23.840
No.

22:23.840 --> 22:26.680
I just got off
the phone with
Josiah Bartlett.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.120
Uh, Yuri,

22:28.120 --> 22:29.760
your surgical
license was denied.

22:29.760 --> 22:32.040
Well, what, uh...

22:32.040 --> 22:36.040
You can't practise
medicine here.

22:46.360 --> 22:50.360
Never should've
had that chorizo.

22:54.040 --> 22:55.920
             Ah...

22:55.920 --> 22:57.400
         remember, kids,

22:57.400 --> 23:01.400
     save those wrappers.

23:05.440 --> 23:09.440
Last request?

23:10.440 --> 23:14.440
A wet nap?

23:27.520 --> 23:31.520
We're going
to be parents.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.560
Ready for me
upstairs?

23:35.560 --> 23:38.840
We need
to talk first.

23:38.840 --> 23:41.720
I want you
to understand

23:41.720 --> 23:43.920
the risks
of this procedure.

23:43.920 --> 23:46.120
Is there something
you didn't tell us?

23:46.120 --> 23:49.640
No, but I'm not sure
I made myself clear.

23:49.640 --> 23:52.840
The transfusion could
send Gail into labour.

23:52.840 --> 23:54.480
You explained that.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.640
You're aware
there's some possibility
of foetal demise.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.880
Are you making excuses
before beginning?

23:59.880 --> 24:02.520
You're not giving us
much confidence.

24:02.520 --> 24:06.200
Mr Gillette,
your name appeared
on our computer.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.520
Apparently you're suing
some doctors in Baltimore?

24:08.520 --> 24:10.560
That's none
of your business.

24:10.560 --> 24:12.600
Doctors have to
protect themselves.

24:12.600 --> 24:15.520
You have no right
to invade our privacy.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.200
I don't
like this either.

24:17.200 --> 24:20.680
The doctor-patient relationship is
supposedly based on trust.

24:20.680 --> 24:23.720
Trust? I don't
even know you,

24:23.720 --> 24:25.520
and you're asking us
to let you handle

24:25.520 --> 24:28.120
the most important
event in our lives.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.480
Then if it fails,
it's, "Sorry.

24:30.480 --> 24:33.120
     "Don't hold me accountable."

24:33.120 --> 24:34.680
How can I operate?

24:34.680 --> 24:38.680
My ability's undermined
by your attitude
and suspicions.

24:38.920 --> 24:41.960
I'll do my best, but I can
make a mistake.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.960
I'd have to live
with my conscience,
same as you.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.640
Dr Turner...

24:49.640 --> 24:52.240
I trust you.

24:52.240 --> 24:56.240
Please help us.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.960
Sorry things
didn't work out,

25:02.960 --> 25:05.200
but at least
in this job,

25:05.200 --> 25:07.080
you'll be involved
in medicine.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.520
It's not the OR,

25:08.520 --> 25:12.520
but the blood bank's still vital
in health care.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.720
Haematology.
Important, yes,

25:17.720 --> 25:19.840
but it's only
diagnostic.

25:19.840 --> 25:21.960
In surgery,
you and I would enable the blood

25:21.960 --> 25:24.440
to circulate
through the body,

25:24.440 --> 25:26.360
pump heart and arteries,

25:26.360 --> 25:29.240
we have repaired
the sustaining life,

25:29.240 --> 25:32.440
and I will not
be in the OR

25:32.440 --> 25:36.280
to see the blood's
power to heal.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.800
Listen. Be patient.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.800
We're appealing
the board's ruling.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.160
Hey, Benoit!

25:43.160 --> 25:45.000
Where are you?

25:45.000 --> 25:47.400
I'll have to
find Dr Benoit.

25:47.400 --> 25:51.400
He's in charge here.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.600
Misfire, huh?

26:16.600 --> 26:19.280
Come on, let's go.

26:19.280 --> 26:22.080
You're my prisoner.

26:22.080 --> 26:26.080
                       10 points.

26:58.480 --> 27:00.200
Have a seat.

27:00.200 --> 27:01.880
Thanks for
finding time for me.

27:01.880 --> 27:04.360
My problems aren't
life and death.

27:04.360 --> 27:08.360
You learn in dermatology rotation
that oily skin is an emergency.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.160
Actually, I'm here
for my hair.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.160
Um...
what hair?

27:13.160 --> 27:14.640
   Exactly.

27:14.640 --> 27:18.640
Oh! You want
to resod?
Medically, you have
several choices.

27:18.960 --> 27:22.240
Plugs - transplanting healthy hair
to the bald area,

27:22.240 --> 27:26.080
if you don't mind pain, scabs,
and looking like a doll's head.

27:26.080 --> 27:29.600
Then there's
hair-weaving,
the same as plugs,

27:29.600 --> 27:31.520
except you look like
a grape arbour.

27:31.520 --> 27:33.160
Could be impetigo.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.800
What about lotion?

27:34.800 --> 27:37.040
Oh, hydrocort.
Thanks.

27:37.040 --> 27:39.240
I was talking
about a new drug.

27:39.240 --> 27:40.800
Supposed to grow hair.

27:40.800 --> 27:43.520
Oh! Oh! Minoxidil.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.120
It was originally
developed to lower
blood pressure.

27:46.120 --> 27:50.080
Some of the users started to look
like werewolves or Michael Landon.

27:50.080 --> 27:51.560
They started using it experimentally
on bald patients,

27:51.560 --> 27:54.920
and they found
promising results.

27:54.920 --> 27:56.960
Trowel it on.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.520
That's the problem with
dermatology patients.

27:58.520 --> 28:00.960
Only concerned
about cosmetics,

28:00.960 --> 28:03.120
never about the possible
side effects,

28:03.120 --> 28:06.080
you know, like
increased heart rate

28:06.080 --> 28:07.440
and difficulty breathing

28:07.440 --> 28:08.520
and weight gain.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.280
and weight gain.
Calm down.

28:09.280 --> 28:11.000
You don't know what this
department's like.

28:11.000 --> 28:14.720
People always say to me, "Here.
Look at this." I cringe.

28:14.720 --> 28:18.720
They lift flaps of skin
and spread their folds,

28:19.320 --> 28:21.920
then they expect me
to touch them!

28:21.920 --> 28:23.600
Sounds awful.

28:23.600 --> 28:26.680
Teenage girls
with a few zits,
no problem.

28:26.680 --> 28:28.440
Old men
with liver spots,

28:28.440 --> 28:30.000
doesn't even
rattle me.

28:30.000 --> 28:31.520
Not even
planter's warts.

28:31.520 --> 28:33.600
But ringworm!
Weeping dermatitis!

28:33.600 --> 28:35.800
Eczema! Seborrhea!
Psoriasis!

28:35.800 --> 28:37.600
Why don't
I stop back?

28:37.600 --> 28:41.600
No. You came here
for me to help. I'm here.

28:41.960 --> 28:43.440
I just have
one question.

28:43.440 --> 28:44.960
I just have
one question.
What's that?

28:44.960 --> 28:48.240
You shampooed
this morning?

28:48.240 --> 28:49.400
And conditioned.

28:49.400 --> 28:50.920
Oh, no problem.

28:50.920 --> 28:54.920
Let's have a look.

29:03.720 --> 29:07.720
   Hey!

29:13.360 --> 29:14.600
             Lie still.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.280
Dr Wade's trying to locate
the baby's position

29:17.280 --> 29:18.720
               with the ultrasound.

29:18.720 --> 29:21.000
After entering the
peritoneal cavity,

29:21.000 --> 29:25.000
I'll inject 60cc's
of matched blood.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.320
There's the head...

29:28.320 --> 29:30.160
feet...

29:30.160 --> 29:32.240
and little hands folded.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.560
Stay with me,
Jackie.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.080
Sorry.

29:36.080 --> 29:38.200
Ok, Gail. You'll feel
a slight stick.

29:38.200 --> 29:42.200
After that, you shouldn't
know we're there.

29:42.680 --> 29:44.360
Holler if
the baby moves.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.400
We're not
taking any chances.

29:46.400 --> 29:48.680
Is it a boy or girl?

29:48.680 --> 29:50.200
You really
want to know?

29:50.200 --> 29:51.920
                   Folks, folks.

29:51.920 --> 29:54.240
              First things first.

29:54.240 --> 29:58.240
          We're just about there.

30:01.160 --> 30:03.360
                   Almost there.

30:03.360 --> 30:06.920
Blood's here.

30:06.920 --> 30:10.080
The baby's moving.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.840
I can't enter the cavity
from this angle.

30:12.840 --> 30:14.200
Still moving.

30:14.200 --> 30:15.400
Still moving.
              OK, I'm with you.

30:15.400 --> 30:17.320
Don't let
anything happen.

30:17.320 --> 30:21.320
Lie still.

30:21.480 --> 30:25.480
I can do this.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.040
         What's cooking?

30:30.040 --> 30:32.440
Pulse rate's
up to 150.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.360
I'll help you,
Mr Stroud.

30:34.360 --> 30:35.800
My heart...

30:35.800 --> 30:37.560
jumping out
of my chest.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.000
        It's tachycardia.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.000
We have
to start an IV.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.280
     Dunk your face in here.

30:47.280 --> 30:51.280
             Come on.

31:00.880 --> 31:02.320
Hey.

31:02.320 --> 31:04.240
It worked.

31:04.240 --> 31:06.640
I've never seen
that done before.

31:06.640 --> 31:09.040
Cold water stimulates
increased vagal tone.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.920
It reduces heart
to a normal rhythm.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.320
Sorry about
the wet PJs.

31:14.320 --> 31:18.320
I'll get you
a fresh gown.

31:23.400 --> 31:24.880
I tend to forget -

31:24.880 --> 31:27.280
you do know
your medicine.

31:27.280 --> 31:31.280
People just see
what they want to see.

31:32.520 --> 31:33.960
Dr Griffin,

31:33.960 --> 31:37.800
why not assume
we started off
on the wrong foot,

31:37.800 --> 31:40.200
and wipe the slate clean?

31:40.200 --> 31:42.720
I've always loved
clapping erasers.

31:42.720 --> 31:46.720
                  Thanks.

32:00.320 --> 32:03.240
We played
the Boston Pops team last month.

32:03.240 --> 32:06.480
They were
better than you.

32:06.480 --> 32:10.480
             Aw. Man.

32:10.480 --> 32:11.640
Boomer?

32:11.640 --> 32:13.560
Boomer, yeah!
Get the flag!

32:13.560 --> 32:15.960
All right!
All right!

32:15.960 --> 32:17.360
Get us out of here!

32:17.360 --> 32:19.040
                            Hey!

32:19.040 --> 32:20.080
You're out.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.160
He nailed you,
Morrison.

32:22.160 --> 32:26.160
Be a good boy.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.400
It's just a game!

32:28.400 --> 32:32.400
It's just a game!

32:48.960 --> 32:50.000
Richard!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.800
Let me show
you something.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.520
Helen?
Miss Ramos.

32:53.520 --> 32:55.400
Yeah. I VC'd her.

32:55.400 --> 32:58.520
You'd better start it up again.
Hi, Richard.

32:58.520 --> 33:01.520
What did you
want to show me?

33:01.520 --> 33:02.960
Not here.
It's private.

33:02.960 --> 33:05.680
Richard, did you try
that Minoxidil I prescribed?

33:05.680 --> 33:07.600
Actually, I...

33:07.600 --> 33:11.360
well...

33:11.360 --> 33:12.800
Wow!

33:12.800 --> 33:14.400
Aah!

33:14.400 --> 33:16.360
That stuff
really works.

33:16.360 --> 33:18.000
A toupee.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.240
What do you think?

33:20.240 --> 33:22.080
Want me to be honest?

33:22.080 --> 33:25.040
Completely.

33:25.040 --> 33:29.040
Well...

33:37.320 --> 33:41.320
Richard Clarendon?

33:47.120 --> 33:50.000
I want to tell you
my feelings

33:50.000 --> 33:51.600
about that
computer blacklist.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.160
I see how you feel.

33:53.160 --> 33:54.600
I see how you feel.
              You know nothing.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.520
Let's go
to my office.

33:56.520 --> 33:58.960
I don't want
to cool down!

33:58.960 --> 34:01.320
I just finished
Mrs Gillette's transfusion.

34:01.320 --> 34:04.600
Because I was made to feel
paranoid, I hesitated.

34:04.600 --> 34:06.080
I second-guessed myself.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.239
That facilitates
losing a patient.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.800
Today I felt
like an accident
waiting to happen.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.320
How did the surgery go?

34:13.320 --> 34:17.320
Mother and baby are fine.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.080
   Thanks.

34:22.080 --> 34:26.080
For giving me room
to kick...like a mule.

34:36.520 --> 34:38.880
You were
with a patient.

34:38.880 --> 34:41.880
Why do you
clean floors?

34:41.880 --> 34:45.239
I'm studying to be
a physician's assistant.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.639
Meanwhile,
I double as an orderly.

34:47.639 --> 34:48.760
Luther Hawkins.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.199
Yuri Peltrovich.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.639
Dr Peltrovich?

34:51.639 --> 34:53.080
Not in your country.

34:53.080 --> 34:54.520
Unable to get certified.

34:54.520 --> 34:55.960
Yeah. Me, too.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.880
My experience
as a paramedic,

34:57.880 --> 34:59.800
my years
at St Eligius,

34:59.800 --> 35:01.720
I'm still short
on my PA license.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.640
You must be
very upset.

35:03.640 --> 35:05.080
You're damn right.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.960
I've got Drs Auschlander
and Westphall on my side.

35:07.960 --> 35:10.360
They helped me whip
the bureaucracy

35:10.360 --> 35:12.240
so I can get ahead.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.160
Yeah?
You still push mop.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.520
Your beginnings
aren't important.

35:16.520 --> 35:18.480
I'm a guy from
a poor neighbourhood,

35:18.480 --> 35:19.920
very few opportunities.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.320
What counts is
where I'm going.

35:22.320 --> 35:25.200
You do whatever
till something better comes along.

35:25.200 --> 35:28.080
You got to keep fighting
for your dreams.

35:28.080 --> 35:32.080
That's America.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.800
Jackie, hi.

35:44.880 --> 35:47.240
I'm sorry about
my meltdown earlier.

35:47.240 --> 35:51.240
I didn't mean
to yell at you.

35:56.400 --> 35:58.800
You know
how hard it is,

35:58.800 --> 36:02.800
walking around
with this huge cloud
hung over my head?

36:04.520 --> 36:06.440
Of course,
you wouldn't know.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.880
Everybody likes you.

36:07.880 --> 36:10.920
You're just a sweet,
small-town girl -

36:10.920 --> 36:14.920
uncomplicated,
never throw any curves.

36:40.840 --> 36:42.400
KNOCK ON DOOR

36:42.400 --> 36:46.400
It's open.

36:52.120 --> 36:55.800
Gail is resting.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.720
This whole thing has
been stressful for her.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.120
For both of us.

37:00.120 --> 37:02.080
Count me in, too.

37:02.080 --> 37:06.080
You can sit,
if you want.

37:10.200 --> 37:14.080
As far as I'm concerned,
this baby is a miracle.

37:14.080 --> 37:18.080
Immaculate conception.

37:18.400 --> 37:20.840
In a manner
of speaking, yeah.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.200
Uh, see, the reason...

37:23.200 --> 37:27.200
I'm suing those doctors
at Immaculata in Baltimore...

37:29.640 --> 37:31.800
I went in for a hernia.

37:31.800 --> 37:33.720
They botched the job.

37:33.720 --> 37:37.720
They tied off
the testicular artery
by mistake.

37:37.720 --> 37:41.200
I lost a testicle
because of their incompetence.

37:41.200 --> 37:42.680
I see.

37:42.680 --> 37:46.680
I know a man
doesn't need both
to be fertile, but...

37:47.600 --> 37:51.600
   still...

37:52.920 --> 37:55.800
..you get scared something else
might happen.

37:55.800 --> 37:59.800
That's why I was
uptight with you.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.960
You wait and see, though.

38:02.960 --> 38:06.800
My child
will  be  a superbaby.

38:06.800 --> 38:10.800
Prenatal education
has just begun.

38:12.040 --> 38:15.440
   Thanks.

38:15.440 --> 38:16.880
Mr Gillette...

38:16.880 --> 38:18.800
good luck
with your lawsuit.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.200
I mean it.

38:20.200 --> 38:22.160
Find out the truth.

38:22.160 --> 38:23.600
But remember -

38:23.600 --> 38:25.680
there are no guarantees
in the OR -

38:25.680 --> 38:27.440
or in our kids.

38:27.440 --> 38:30.320
That baby of yours
isn't PC Junior.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.840
You can't
program him.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.280
Give nature
enough room

38:34.280 --> 38:38.280
to work
a little magic.

38:42.120 --> 38:46.120
I'll start a new game -
conscientious objector.

38:46.120 --> 38:48.040
Take a bus to Canada,

38:48.040 --> 38:50.800
shoot yourself in the foot
with a paint pellet,

38:50.800 --> 38:54.800
wait till Jimmy Carter
gives you amnesty.

38:55.240 --> 38:57.160
How you feeling,
Boomer?

38:57.160 --> 38:59.680
Ahh. I'll live.

38:59.680 --> 39:02.760
The biggest casualty
was my Hersheys.

39:02.760 --> 39:06.760
I'm sorry
for dragging you
out there today.

39:07.200 --> 39:08.640
What a goose egg.

39:08.640 --> 39:10.920
Those accountants are
really into violence.

39:10.920 --> 39:13.240
Working with
numbers all day,
you would be, too.

39:13.240 --> 39:15.400
Playing games
makes them think

39:15.400 --> 39:18.400
they're facing
real life and death
situations.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.480
We just walk
into the ICU.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.600
Victor.

39:22.600 --> 39:25.000
Pudge.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.920
Come on.
Join the brigade.

39:26.920 --> 39:29.800
No, I'm trying
to keep my pores closed.

39:29.800 --> 39:32.200
I came here
to congratulate you.

39:32.200 --> 39:33.840
Oh, thanks. For what?

39:33.840 --> 39:37.840
Oh. Maybe I wasn't
supposed to say anything.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.000
Elliot, don't
do this to me.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.400
He popped you
pretty hard.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.440
   Mmm.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.840
I did my share
of swinging.

39:58.840 --> 40:00.680
Bobbing and weaving.

40:00.680 --> 40:04.280
Actually you didn't
have much form, but...

40:04.280 --> 40:07.000
Looked like rock 'em,
sock 'em robots.

40:07.000 --> 40:09.880
Arms and legs
flying every which way.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.760
I don't know
what happened.

40:12.760 --> 40:16.360
Getting chased,
someone coming after me,

40:16.360 --> 40:19.600
I finally had to
draw the line.

40:19.600 --> 40:22.520
Tired of running.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.960
Does that make sense?

40:23.960 --> 40:27.960
Makes perfect sense.

40:28.240 --> 40:30.200
I was gone,

40:30.200 --> 40:34.200
and that felt great.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.520
Getting even with
all the Stevie Hills
and Nick Moats.

40:41.720 --> 40:45.720
Satisfaction only
lasted a few moments.

40:46.480 --> 40:49.800
It didn't
accomplish anything.

40:49.800 --> 40:53.800
It just created
new problems.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.960
This steam's not
making me feel better.

40:57.960 --> 41:01.960
I'll see you later.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.800
You put the top down.

41:21.800 --> 41:23.440
              Helen, I love you.

41:23.440 --> 41:26.480
Your energy,
your body.

41:26.480 --> 41:29.080
Not in front
of the hospital.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.640
Let's find
a side street.

41:31.640 --> 41:33.960
Now listen,
let's talk.

41:33.960 --> 41:37.960
What's gotten
into you?

41:38.280 --> 41:40.400
Are you still
interested in me?

41:40.400 --> 41:41.960
Of course I am.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.400
             Look at me.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.360
You can't because
I'm sitting down,

41:45.360 --> 41:46.920
but underneath
these clothes,

41:46.920 --> 41:49.320
I'm as rumpled
as they are.

41:49.320 --> 41:52.000
Remember our first time
at the motel?

41:52.000 --> 41:53.440
I was embarrassed.

41:53.440 --> 41:57.440
It was right after
my mastectomy
and breast implant.

41:58.400 --> 42:00.800
I was afraid
you'd reject me.

42:00.800 --> 42:03.480
But you were
so at ease.

42:03.480 --> 42:06.280
I had
nothing to lose...

42:06.280 --> 42:07.400
                  then.

42:07.400 --> 42:11.120
              Now, well...

42:11.120 --> 42:14.120
You've rotated husbands
every four years.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.360
          We've been together two.

42:15.360 --> 42:16.680
The clock's not running.

42:16.680 --> 42:20.000
              I lost my...

42:20.000 --> 42:22.880
I started losing my hair
in junior high.

42:22.880 --> 42:26.880
By 12, I was already
dubbed "the fender."

42:27.200 --> 42:30.800
Guys like Griffin
would have been so jealous

42:30.800 --> 42:32.760
       of that kid's duck-tail.

42:32.760 --> 42:35.800
Our voices were
getting deeper,

42:35.800 --> 42:38.080
we were supposed to be
growing hair,

42:38.080 --> 42:41.840
muscles hardening,
just becoming men.

42:41.840 --> 42:44.440
I already looked like
somebody's grandfather.

42:44.440 --> 42:48.440
Disqualified myself
in the race for women. Today...

42:48.640 --> 42:52.120
all those insecurities
came flooding back.

42:52.120 --> 42:54.400
You know...

42:54.400 --> 42:56.560
after all my marriages,

42:56.560 --> 43:00.560
I'm finally looking
at a relationship
from the inside out.

43:00.640 --> 43:02.680
When I gaze at you,

43:02.680 --> 43:06.400
I don't see a bald head
or a slight paunch,

43:06.400 --> 43:10.400
I see the man I love.

43:16.080 --> 43:20.080
Let's go home.

43:21.840 --> 43:25.840
              What slight paunch?

43:31.320 --> 43:34.320
Yuri hasn't
said much tonight.

43:34.320 --> 43:38.320
He's probably
deciding how to drop
the bombski on Masha.

43:39.120 --> 43:42.440
Explain his licence
was rejected.

43:42.440 --> 43:43.920
If you ask me,

43:43.920 --> 43:47.240
Yuri's ready to catch
the next plane home.

43:47.240 --> 43:50.160
You really think
he'd return to Russia?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.560
If he does,

43:52.560 --> 43:54.440
poor Masha will
be devastated.

43:54.440 --> 43:56.840
Why anyone would
want to live

43:56.840 --> 43:59.760
in the Union
of Soviet Socialist
Republics...

43:59.760 --> 44:03.600
I mean, lousy cars,
second-rate housing,

44:03.600 --> 44:05.960
standing on line
to buy food.

44:05.960 --> 44:08.800
This rib roast
is the best shot

44:08.800 --> 44:12.200
Masha has of keeping
Yuri here.

44:12.200 --> 44:13.600
Here we go.

44:13.600 --> 44:16.000
  OK.

44:16.000 --> 44:18.920
Look at the size
of this rib roast.

44:18.920 --> 44:20.360
Huh?

44:20.360 --> 44:21.800
                   This is nice.

44:21.800 --> 44:23.200
Very nice.

44:23.200 --> 44:24.680
OK.

44:24.680 --> 44:28.520
Let's pass
the food.

44:28.520 --> 44:32.520
Yuri, you told nothing
of hospital.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.920
Well, first day
was informative.

44:38.920 --> 44:42.360
I want to say something.

44:42.360 --> 44:43.360
Dr Craig...

44:43.360 --> 44:44.800
Hmm?

44:44.800 --> 44:47.160
Mrs Craig.

44:47.160 --> 44:49.640
Thank you
for your generosity.

44:49.640 --> 44:51.480
Masha,

44:51.480 --> 44:54.280
your political views

44:54.280 --> 44:57.800
forced us to
leave our homeland.

44:57.800 --> 45:01.120
You raised your voice
against oppression.

45:01.120 --> 45:04.000
Today I met someone
who reminded me

45:04.000 --> 45:07.680
that we have to fight
for what's important to us.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.880
Thank you.

45:09.880 --> 45:11.840
No. Somebody else.

45:11.840 --> 45:14.720
Who helped me to realise

45:14.720 --> 45:17.240
that this country
is a place

45:17.240 --> 45:20.440
where individual struggle
is celebrated...

45:20.440 --> 45:24.440
That people must be allowed
to improve themselves

45:24.760 --> 45:28.760
and make mistakes.

45:28.840 --> 45:32.840
Masha.

45:33.080 --> 45:37.000
Masha.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.000
A toast!

45:42.360 --> 45:43.800
To you...

45:43.800 --> 45:47.120
and to our new life
together here.

45:47.120 --> 45:50.720
And to America!

45:50.720 --> 45:51.960
Hear, hear!

45:51.960 --> 45:55.960
            Na zdorovia!

45:58.120 --> 46:02.120
Not the baccarat!

46:26.320 --> 46:34.000
