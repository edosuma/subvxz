00:01.710 --> 00:05.089
DRAGON: /In a land of myth
and a time of magic,

00:05.214 --> 00:10.261
the destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young boy.

00:10.386 --> 00:13.097
His name, Merlin.

00:34.577 --> 00:37.788
My Lord. He is here.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.464
You are Myror.

00:48.299 --> 00:50.301
Legend has it,
you are the most feared assassin

00:50.426 --> 00:51.969
in all the known lands.

00:52.762 --> 00:54.430
Tell me.

00:54.513 --> 00:56.807
Are you as ruthless
as they say you are?

00:57.475 --> 01:00.353
-You would kill anyone?
-I have killed many people.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.938
They are all the same to me.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.816
You are prepared
to kill royalty?

01:05.942 --> 01:09.362
My Lord, you would already be dead had
someone placed a bounty on you.

01:12.323 --> 01:13.616
(GRUNTING)

01:30.383 --> 01:35.554
| want you to kill the man
who murdered my son.

01:36.847 --> 01:40.685
| want you to Kill
Arthur Pendragon.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.074
That has got to hurt.

02:38.617 --> 02:41.370
That's the point, Merlin.
It's not a pillow fight.

02:42.413 --> 02:44.206
Fetch me another lance,
will you?

03:08.439 --> 03:11.025
Why did you pull out? I was wide open,
you could have unhorsed me.

03:11.275 --> 03:14.403
-I was fearful that I might injure you, Sire.
-You had the advantage.

03:14.487 --> 03:16.280
You can't afford to hesitate.

03:16.364 --> 03:18.532
| wouldn't have done if I were facing
a different opponent.

03:20.076 --> 03:22.578
You are the future King, my Lord.

03:23.412 --> 03:25.581
You jousted against me
in the tournament last year.

03:25.664 --> 03:29.752
-Are you saying you let me win?
-No, my Lord.

03:34.256 --> 03:36.801
It doesn't matter who I am.

03:36.926 --> 03:39.220
| do not expect
any special treatment from you,

03:39.303 --> 03:42.306
from any of you.
Is that understood!

03:51.482 --> 03:53.150
How am I going to prove myself,

03:53.275 --> 03:55.611
if my opponents aren't
trying their hardest?

03:55.694 --> 03:58.155
I'm sure it's not happening
all the time.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.242
-So it's happening some of the time?
-No, I'm certain it isn't.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.994
Now you're doing it.
You're telling me

04:04.120 --> 04:06.705
exactly what you think
| want to hear.

04:06.831 --> 04:08.165
Yes.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.960
No. What was the question?

04:12.503 --> 04:14.505
That just proves it.

04:16.507 --> 04:19.468
All my life I've been treated
as if I'm special.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.846
| just want to be treated
like everyone else.

04:22.012 --> 04:23.305
Really?

04:23.389 --> 04:25.307
You have no idea
how lucky you are.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.228
Any time you want to swap places,
just let me know.

04:30.688 --> 04:33.607
That's not
a totally stupid idea.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.194
You're Prince Arthur.
You can't change who you are.

04:41.574 --> 04:43.242
Yes, I can.

04:48.873 --> 04:51.167
We've received reports
that a beast has been sighted

04:51.250 --> 04:54.086
roaming the forest
near the northern borders.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.505
-What's the nature of this beast?
-It's said to have

04:56.589 --> 05:01.427
the body of a lion,
wings of an eagle and the face of a bear.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.513
(SNICKERS)

05:05.848 --> 05:07.933
| believe it has been conjured
by sorcery.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.477
Then we must destroy it.

05:09.560 --> 05:11.270
| leave for
the northern borders in the morning.

05:11.896 --> 05:15.524
-You'll miss the tournament.
-As much as I want to compete,

05:15.608 --> 05:19.069
-my duty to Camelot comes first.
-You're right, of course.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.536
I'll meet you here in four days.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.414
You must tell no one
that I have returned to Camelot.

05:45.804 --> 05:49.517
-You're late.
-Sorry... Gaius... The floors...

05:55.439 --> 05:57.608
What is that smell?
Whose clothes are these?

05:58.067 --> 05:59.777
They're mine.
| washed them specially.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.072
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.449
It seems pretending to be someone else
is the only way

06:05.574 --> 06:07.826
to get people to
be honest with me.

06:07.952 --> 06:10.663
-Grab my bag, will you?
-To pass as a peasant,

06:10.788 --> 06:14.667
-you should probably carry your own bag.
-You're forgetting something, Merlin.

06:14.792 --> 06:17.503
No one will know it's my bag.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.715
There must be easier ways
to prove yourself.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.133
Shut up, Merlin.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.302
| was there in person.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.596
Odin has put a price
on Prince Arthur's head.

06:27.680 --> 06:31.141
-Surely he wouldn't dare?
-He is blinded by grief, my Lord.

06:31.267 --> 06:34.562
The assassin Myror
has accepted the bounty.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.897
| have heard of this Myror.

06:36.981 --> 06:40.276
| believe he is
heading for Camelot as we speak.

06:41.318 --> 06:45.322
| bring you this information
at great risk to myself.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.580
Double the guard.
| want this assassin intercepted

06:52.663 --> 06:54.999
before he reaches Camelot.

07:13.601 --> 07:15.019
(BELL TOLLING)

07:28.657 --> 07:29.700
My Lord.

07:31.535 --> 07:35.456
Guinevere, it's good of you
to let me stay in your home.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.207
I'm happy to help.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.878
-Food.
-I'll prepare some food for you.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.176
| can't believe
you talked me into this.

07:51.138 --> 07:54.308
You can't really expect me
to stay here?

07:54.391 --> 07:55.476
We need to keep you out of sight.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.436
We can trust Gwen
not to tell anyone you're here.

07:57.519 --> 07:59.897
-Doubt anyone would believe it.
-Well, if you really can't cope

07:59.980 --> 08:02.900
without your big bed
and your soft pillows...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.736
This will be fine.

08:07.571 --> 08:10.282
How are the preparations coming along?
You found someone to

08:10.366 --> 08:12.409
-play our knight for the tournament?
-Absolutely.

08:12.493 --> 08:15.579
He's a farmer
from one of the outlying villages

08:15.704 --> 08:18.207
and no one will recognize him.

08:19.416 --> 08:20.668
But does he look the part?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.681
Great.

08:52.950 --> 08:55.786
From now on,
you're Sir William of Deira.

08:59.581 --> 09:02.042
Imagine you're
really arrogant.

09:02.126 --> 09:04.545
Knights think they're so much better
than everyone else.

09:04.628 --> 09:06.588
It's not arrogance.
Ignore him. He's an idiot.

09:07.131 --> 09:10.467
A knight must behave
with honor and nobility.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.305
That's better.

09:16.473 --> 09:21.311
You must convince everyone that you were
born into a noble family.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.736
Polish my armor, boy.

09:30.654 --> 09:32.322
Now you're
getting the hang of it.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.824
(LAUGHS)

09:34.658 --> 09:36.410
That's a good point, you do need
to polish our armor.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.494
Yeah.

09:38.328 --> 09:39.496
(LAUGHS)

09:45.502 --> 09:46.920
(SIGHS)

09:48.464 --> 09:50.340
I'm glad to see
you resting, Merlin.

09:50.424 --> 09:54.428
| take it that means
you've got the energy to clean my leech tank.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.181
(GROANS)

10:02.352 --> 10:07.357
It's been a long day.
| think I'll turn in for the night.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.985
Is this my bed?

10:12.863 --> 10:16.617
Of course.
| hope you'll be comfortable.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.161
I'm sure I will be.

10:46.522 --> 10:48.982
Good night, Guinevere.

10:51.735 --> 10:53.570
Good night, my Lord.

11:36.029 --> 11:39.241
Halt. Show yourself.

11:42.119 --> 11:43.412
(CHUCKLES)

11:44.121 --> 11:45.873
What business do you have
in the King's palace?

11:45.956 --> 11:49.293
| came to seek an audience
with Prince Arthur.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.463
-What's your name?
-My name is Myror.

12:01.805 --> 12:04.975
-Why are you here?
-Your information was wrong.

12:05.100 --> 12:08.395
Prince Arthur is not among the party
traveling to the northern borders.

12:08.478 --> 12:11.148
-The Prince left with them yesterday...
-They must have separated.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.151
-Perhaps he has returned to Camelot?
-Not that I've heard.

12:14.276 --> 12:17.446
His return would have been
announced at Court.

12:17.988 --> 12:21.491
It would seem the Prince
does not want to be found.

12:21.825 --> 12:23.118
Hmm.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.330
(SIGHS)

12:28.165 --> 12:30.000
(HORSE WHINNYING)

12:39.426 --> 12:42.512
ARTHUR: Remember the plan.
I'm competing in the tournament,

12:42.638 --> 12:45.098
but no one will
know that it's me.

12:45.182 --> 12:49.186
All you have to do is acknowledge the crowd
at the end of the match.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.105
Act like you belong there

12:54.358 --> 12:56.360
and people will
believe that you do.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.663
Knights of the realm,
welcome to Camelot.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.875
You have trained for this day
for many years.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.672
-He hasn't fallen off his horse.
-I suppose that's something.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.341
And your skill to the test.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.511
Today, you will fight
for glory and for honor.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.180
For this is the ultimate
test of courage

13:25.263 --> 13:28.266
and it will be the measure of you as men.

13:28.600 --> 13:32.562
For only the most skillful,
the most fearless among you,

13:32.646 --> 13:35.482
will emerge as
a worthy champion.

13:35.857 --> 13:36.900
(CROWD CHEERING)

13:46.952 --> 13:48.036
They're ready for you, Sire.

14:33.915 --> 14:35.167
(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

15:34.142 --> 15:35.936
You must go
and acknowledge the crowd.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.396
-How do I do that?
-You wave. They cheer.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.689
It's not difficult.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.570
| do all the work,
someone else gets all the praise.

15:45.654 --> 15:47.531
| know the feeling.

15:47.614 --> 15:51.118
When I win this tournament,
I'll reveal my true identity.

15:51.201 --> 15:54.704
-Get the credit I deserve.
-Yeah. Of course you will.

15:55.914 --> 15:59.209
Well, don't just stand there.
Help me off with my armor.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.586
And remember
to polish it before tomorrow,

16:01.670 --> 16:03.088
the horse needs grooming

16:03.171 --> 16:05.757
and don't forget
to repair the broken lances...

16:11.388 --> 16:13.807
Do you have news on the
whereabouts of Prince Arthur?

16:14.057 --> 16:16.935
Everyone believes he is traveling
to the northern borders,

16:17.018 --> 16:20.313
but I have discovered that
Arthur's servant remains in Camelot.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.941
-Who is this servant?
-That's him.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.239
Why is he working
for another knight?

16:46.673 --> 16:48.466
Is this about the leech tank?

16:48.550 --> 16:52.512
-How very perceptive of you, Merlin.
-I'll clean it tomorrow.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.348
And will that be before or after
you've scrubbed the floors

16:55.432 --> 16:57.309
and done the laundry?

17:17.037 --> 17:18.663
From what I hear, the ladies of the court

17:18.747 --> 17:23.210
are quite impressed with Sir William.
They think he's very handsome.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.837
Typical. They wouldn't know
a real knight

17:25.921 --> 17:28.715
if he whacked
them 'round the head with his lance.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.221
Why are you doing this?

17:38.391 --> 17:41.978
| fear that people respect me
just because of my title.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.772
| don't believe
that's true of everyone.

17:43.855 --> 17:46.942
-Would you tell me if it were?
-No.

17:51.905 --> 17:55.116
When I'm competing as William,
my title doesn't matter.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.868
Nobody gives me
any special treatment.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.287
So when I win this tournament,

18:00.205 --> 18:05.168
if I win this tournament,
it will be because I deserve it,

18:06.253 --> 18:10.423
not because I'm Prince Arthur.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.682
| think I'll take a bath.

18:19.891 --> 18:23.228
That might be difficult,
seeing as I don't have a bath tub.

18:23.311 --> 18:24.562
Really?

18:26.398 --> 18:29.859
Perhaps you could prepare me
a bowl of hot water.

18:29.943 --> 18:34.072
- I take it you have a bowl?
- I think I can manage a bowl.

18:39.744 --> 18:43.164
I'll just walk all the way down to the well
and fetch some water then, shall I?

18:43.248 --> 18:44.541
(GROANS)

18:47.210 --> 18:48.920
(ROOSTER CROWING)

18:59.055 --> 19:03.101
Merlin, on your feet.
Arthur may be away, but I am not.

19:03.184 --> 19:06.062
And why is my
leech tank still dirty?

19:06.146 --> 19:09.107
Where do you get the idea that
you can sit around all day doing nothing?

19:11.109 --> 19:13.236
Do you think I sit around
doing nothing?

19:15.655 --> 19:18.867
| haven't had a chance to sit around and
do nothing since the day I arrived in Camelot.

19:18.950 --> 19:22.120
I'm too busy running after Arthur.
"Do this, Merlin. Do that."

19:22.203 --> 19:24.497
And when I'm not running around after Arthur
I'm doing chores for you,

19:24.581 --> 19:26.750
and if I'm not doing that
I'm fulfilling my destiny.

19:26.833 --> 19:31.171
Do you know how many times I've saved
Arthur's life? I've lost count.

19:31.254 --> 19:32.380
Do I get any thanks? No!

19:32.464 --> 19:34.966
| have fought griffins, witches, bandits.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.510
| have been punched, poisoned,
pelted with fruit.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.304
And all the while I have to hide
who I really am,

19:39.387 --> 19:41.473
because if anyone finds out
Uther will have me executed.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.933
Sometimes I feel like I'm being pulled
in so many directions,

19:44.017 --> 19:45.810
| don't know which way to turn!

20:04.037 --> 20:05.538
(CROWD CHEERING)

20:10.418 --> 20:13.129
Sir Alynor has
advanced to the final.

21:10.645 --> 21:14.482
You're not impressed by this
Sir William of Deira?

21:14.566 --> 21:16.943
| believe he's
an arrogant pig.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.780
Congratulations.
You are in the final.

21:24.993 --> 21:28.121
Go on then.
Your people await you.

21:30.665 --> 21:33.376
No one can say
Sir Leon let me win this time.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.502
(CROWD CHEERING LOUDLY)

21:34.586 --> 21:37.380
It sounds like
the crowd are really taking to William.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.175
That will change
when I reveal my identity.

21:40.258 --> 21:43.178
You really miss getting
all the attention, don't you?

21:43.261 --> 21:45.972
Just go and water
the horse will you.

21:49.392 --> 21:50.727
(EXHALES)

21:56.149 --> 21:58.485
He's a fine horse.

21:59.986 --> 22:02.071
| see your master
has advanced to the final.

22:02.155 --> 22:04.657
He is extremely
skilled with a lance.

22:04.741 --> 22:07.994
He's doing well.
Just one more match to go.

22:08.077 --> 22:10.288
Tell me,
what is he like to work for?

22:10.371 --> 22:13.374
Between me and you,
he can be bit of a prat.

22:15.460 --> 22:17.712
So you are no longer
working for Prince Arthur?

22:17.795 --> 22:22.592
No.
Yes, not right now, though. Arthur's away.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.887
I'm just helping out.

22:28.348 --> 22:32.727
| wish your master luck
in the final.

22:33.311 --> 22:34.562
Thanks.

22:38.900 --> 22:41.194
-Guinevere?
-Just a minute.

22:45.240 --> 22:48.993
Have you got a needle and thread?
My shirt needs mending.

22:53.998 --> 22:56.376
Is this where you sleep?
Where's your bed?

22:57.252 --> 22:58.378
You're sleeping in it.

23:00.338 --> 23:05.593
-Why didn't you say something?
-How could 1? You're Prince Arthur.

23:07.804 --> 23:10.640
Besides, you didn't give me the chance.
You just assumed the bed was yours.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.475
How am I supposed to know
if you don't tell me?

23:12.559 --> 23:13.560
You shouldn't need to be told to think

23:13.643 --> 23:15.687
of someone other than yourself.
You're not a child.

23:23.903 --> 23:26.030
Is there anything else
you'd like to say to me?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.409
Please. I'd like to hear it.

23:30.034 --> 23:34.289
If there's something you
want to say to me, don't let me stop you.

23:34.872 --> 23:38.418
-You don't have any idea, do you?
-About what?

23:38.501 --> 23:40.878
About how rude and arrogant
you can be.

23:42.714 --> 23:45.633
This is my home
and you are my guest in it.

23:45.717 --> 23:47.552
| know you are
used to more luxurious quarters

23:47.635 --> 23:50.555
but that is not an excuse
to be so rude.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.391
You claim titles don't matter to you,
but you behave like a prince

23:53.474 --> 23:55.351
and expect me to
wait on you like a servant.

23:55.435 --> 23:58.104
Saying it means nothing
if your actions betray you.

23:58.187 --> 24:01.691
Would it kill you to say
"Please" and "Thank you" once in a while,

24:04.819 --> 24:06.112
my Lord?

24:11.743 --> 24:13.661
Is there anything else
you'd like to add?

24:15.663 --> 24:17.582
No, I think that's it.

24:26.758 --> 24:27.925
You're right.

24:30.261 --> 24:35.975
You have invited me into your home and |
have behaved appallingly.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.898
- I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
-Oh, really?

24:41.981 --> 24:44.359
Well, perhaps a little.

24:44.442 --> 24:47.612
There's no excuse.
| will make it up to you.

24:48.529 --> 24:51.783
Tonight I will
make dinner for you.

24:54.369 --> 24:56.245
-You're going to cook me dinner?
-I most certainly am.

24:56.329 --> 25:00.124
Now go for a walk, or do whatever it is
that girls do at this time of the evening.

25:00.208 --> 25:03.461
-A walk would be nice.
-Your dinner will be ready when you return.

25:14.597 --> 25:18.309
-Where's Arthur?
-He's cooking me dinner.

25:19.310 --> 25:20.436
Arthur's cooking?

25:31.072 --> 25:35.910
-Merlin. Thank God.
-Gwen says you're cooking?

25:35.993 --> 25:38.454
| need you to fetch me two
dinners from the palace kitchens.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.998
-So you're not cooking?
-No.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.583
Gwen doesn't need to know that.

25:42.667 --> 25:48.005
As far as she's concerned,
dinner will be prepared and cooked by me.

25:48.089 --> 25:52.051
-Are you trying to impress her?
-Don't be ridiculous, Merlin.

25:52.135 --> 25:55.138
And get me a decent shirt,
your clothes are making me itch all over.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.973
It's like having fleas.

26:49.442 --> 26:51.486
She's coming.
Quick, out the back way.

26:52.779 --> 26:53.863
Do something with this.

26:56.657 --> 26:58.451
| hope Gwen's impressed
with your cooking.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.585
Guinevere, perfect timing.

27:12.673 --> 27:14.050
Thank you.

27:38.658 --> 27:41.118
This is delicious.

27:41.202 --> 27:43.329
-I'm glad you like it.
-(LAUGHS)

27:57.385 --> 28:00.388
Hey, you. Stop right there.

28:32.295 --> 28:33.504
Dinner's ready.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.800
What I said this morning...

28:37.884 --> 28:41.053
It is I who should be
apologizing to you.

28:41.137 --> 28:45.141
| have failed to appreciate
just how heavy your burden must be.

28:45.224 --> 28:48.811
- I shouldn't have lost my temper.
-It's no wonder you're upset.

28:48.895 --> 28:51.188
There's so much resting
on your young shoulders...

28:51.272 --> 28:54.483
Now that Arthur's away,
you must take time to enjoy yourself.

28:56.152 --> 28:57.862
What about the leech tank?

28:57.945 --> 29:01.532
-Don't even think about the leech tank.
-Really?

29:01.616 --> 29:04.911
All this talk of leeches
will put us off our dinner.

29:08.122 --> 29:10.416
Where did that
chicken come from?

29:12.001 --> 29:13.294
Come in!

29:14.128 --> 29:15.922
The King commands
your presence immediately.

29:18.591 --> 29:22.470
-Can you determine a cause of death?
-His neck's been broken.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.013
There's scarcely a mark on the flesh.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.223
Whoever killed him knew
exactly what he was doing.

29:26.307 --> 29:29.352
Earlier these evening an intruder
was spotted in the lower town.

29:29.435 --> 29:30.436
Then I fear it's true.

29:30.519 --> 29:32.772
Odin has sent an assassin
to kill Arthur.

29:32.855 --> 29:35.691
-An assassin?
-Have you any word from Arthur

29:35.775 --> 29:38.527
-since he left?
-No. None.

29:38.611 --> 29:41.822
With this assassin in Camelot,
we must be thankful Arthur isn't here.

29:41.906 --> 29:43.491
Search the entire town.

29:43.574 --> 29:45.910
| want the assassin found
before Arthur returns.

29:45.993 --> 29:46.994
Yes, my Lord.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.959
So, do I have any more
annoying habits you wish to tell me about?

29:54.627 --> 29:58.089
-No. None.
-There's something else, isn't there?

29:59.840 --> 30:02.426
-What is it?
-Well...

30:03.219 --> 30:05.471
The truth is, you snore.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.558
-I do not snore.
-You do.

30:10.559 --> 30:13.229
The first night you were here,
| thought a pig had got into the house.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.022
So now I'm a pig.
Thank you, Guinevere.

30:15.106 --> 30:17.066
| just meant you
sound like a pig.

30:18.818 --> 30:22.154
- I think I'd better stop talking.
-I'll do that.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.200
Where did you
get those plates?

30:27.535 --> 30:29.245
From the cupboard.

30:30.871 --> 30:34.000
They have the royal seal.
They're from the palace kitchens.

30:34.083 --> 30:36.127
| have washed
enough of them to know.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.964
-Is that's where our food came from?
-Look, I can kill a chicken from 1000 paces

30:40.047 --> 30:42.383
just don't ask me to cook it.
That's what servants are for...

30:46.262 --> 30:50.057
-I didn't mean it like that.
-I'm not ashamed to be a servant.

30:50.141 --> 30:53.936
-At least I'm not a liar.
-We had a nice meal together.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.980
What does it matter
where it came from?

30:56.063 --> 30:58.941
Because I thought you
had shown some humility.

30:59.025 --> 31:02.778
You had done something
kind for me even though I'm just a servant.

31:02.862 --> 31:06.115
A good king should
respect his people no matter who they are.

31:07.033 --> 31:08.409
Guinevere.

31:13.414 --> 31:15.666
| know I have much to learn.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.919
There are some things
that I am terrible at,

31:19.003 --> 31:21.130
cooking being one of them,

31:23.340 --> 31:28.637
but also, knowing what to say
to someone I care about.

31:36.896 --> 31:40.149
Arthur,
there's an assassin in Camelot.

31:40.232 --> 31:41.317
He's here to Kill you.

31:44.695 --> 31:49.742
The assassin Killed a guard.
Your father said Odin sent him.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.327
Why would Odin want you dead?

31:55.081 --> 31:56.707
Because I killed his son.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.505
Odin's son challenged me to a fight.
| had no quarrel with him.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.173
| asked him to withdraw.

32:04.840 --> 32:07.927
Perhaps he felt he had
to prove himself.

32:08.928 --> 32:11.013
| still see his face.

32:14.308 --> 32:16.143
He looked so scared.

32:17.645 --> 32:19.480
You cannot blame yourself.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.067
No one,
but us, knows where you are.

32:23.776 --> 32:26.362
If the assassin
can't find you, he can't Kill you.

32:29.031 --> 32:32.535
-May I continue to stay here?
-Of course. For as long as you need.

32:33.202 --> 32:34.578
Thank you.

32:35.412 --> 32:37.873
-I'll sleep on the floor tonight.
-No, have my bed.

32:37.957 --> 32:39.959
You need to be well-rested
for the tournament tomorrow.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.629
- I will not hear of it. Good night, Guinevere.
-Good night.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.179
Fetch a mattress
from my quarters and bring it up here.

32:52.263 --> 32:53.931
How am I supposed to carry
a mattress on my own?

32:54.014 --> 32:57.017
| don't know. Strap it to your back.

33:10.114 --> 33:12.700
One more match
and the tournament will be over.

33:14.285 --> 33:15.911
You can go back to being
Prince Arthur.

33:25.588 --> 33:28.299
| thought you might wear it for luck.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.180
Thank you.

34:21.560 --> 34:22.645
| must go.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.191
They're nearly
ready for you, Sire.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.577
Sir Alynor,
good luck in the final.

37:14.858 --> 37:17.611
His lance pierced my armor.

37:17.694 --> 37:20.489
-You're losing too much blood.
-Do what you can.

37:20.572 --> 37:23.742
| have to be back on the course
in five minutes, or I forfeit the match.

37:23.826 --> 37:25.661
You can't possibly joust.
You're too badly injured.

37:25.744 --> 37:30.040
| have never withdrawn from a match.
| do not intend to start now.

37:30.124 --> 37:32.668
You would risk your life
to protect your pride?

37:33.377 --> 37:36.672
You have nothing to prove,
least of all to me.

37:40.384 --> 37:44.263
| have everything to prove,
to myself.

38:13.417 --> 38:15.169
You'll have to
pass me my lance.

38:19.590 --> 38:20.799
This is madness.

38:26.555 --> 38:29.766
-Gwen? Where's Arthur?
-He's about to joust.

38:29.850 --> 38:32.436
He's jousting
against the assassin.

39:32.454 --> 39:34.164
(CHANTS)

40:15.581 --> 40:16.957
(GROANING)

40:29.803 --> 40:31.722
You were jousting
against the assassin.

40:31.805 --> 40:34.600
He killed Sir Alynor
and took his place.

40:38.145 --> 40:39.730
The people are waiting
for their champion.

40:42.232 --> 40:44.192
It's time to reveal yourself.

40:48.989 --> 40:50.907
You must go and
collect the trophy.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.996
| thought this was going to be
your moment of glory?

41:01.376 --> 41:04.796
Perhaps this is
a time for humility.

41:53.178 --> 41:56.431
Merlin. Who is this man?
Where's Sir Alynor?

42:01.186 --> 42:04.106
The assassin attacked us
as we returned to Camelot.

42:04.189 --> 42:05.941
| was injured
whilst killing him.

42:06.024 --> 42:09.403
Odin must be made to pay for his actions.
We must strike back at him.

42:09.486 --> 42:12.906
Surely you understand
the grief he feels for the loss of his son?

42:13.907 --> 42:19.287
We should try to make peace with him.
There's been enough bloodshed.

42:22.457 --> 42:23.959
Perhaps you're right.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.003
How was the rest of your trip?
Fruitful?

42:28.046 --> 42:29.214
Very.

42:32.968 --> 42:34.553
| learnt a great deal.

42:37.931 --> 42:41.435
-How was the tournament?
-Excellent. We have a new champion.

42:41.518 --> 42:42.561
Sir William of Deira.

42:45.647 --> 42:48.400
I'm sorry
| missed all the excitement.

43:11.173 --> 43:12.549
Guinevere.

43:15.844 --> 43:17.554
(CLEARING THROAT)

43:21.183 --> 43:23.810
What happened,
while I was staying with you,

43:26.480 --> 43:29.483
I'm afraid my father
would never understand.

43:31.234 --> 43:32.903
You don't have to explain.

43:37.032 --> 43:42.204
Perhaps when you are king,
things will be different.

43:48.668 --> 43:50.212
UTHER: Arthur?

44:27.958 --> 44:30.001
This is horrible.

44:32.546 --> 44:33.713
This is so disgusting.

44:33.797 --> 44:38.134
Well, perhaps you will think
twice about lying to me in future.

44:38.218 --> 44:41.555
And, Merlin,
there's something on your face.

44:42.013 --> 44:43.223
Where?

44:44.641 --> 44:46.101
(EXCLAIMING)

44:47.519 --> 44:48.728
(LAUGHING)

44:54.234 --> 44:55.694
DRAGON: Merlin!

44:57.904 --> 44:59.364
(GASPING)

45:00.740 --> 45:02.158
Its magic, Merlin.

45:02.242 --> 45:05.078
What about the Druids?
They help people like you.

45:05.161 --> 45:07.497
Uther thinks that
Morgana's been kidnapped.

45:10.625 --> 45:11.751
This way!

45:14.713 --> 45:17.299
DRAGON: It would be better
if the witch never knew

45:17.382 --> 45:19.551
the true extent of her powers.
