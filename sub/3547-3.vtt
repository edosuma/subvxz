00:00.125 --> 00:02.041
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives.

00:02.875 --> 00:04.083
Prior to implantation,

00:04.166 --> 00:07.333
your embryo was accidentally switched
with another client's.

00:07.417 --> 00:10.375
<i>Carlos and Gabby</i>
<i>didn't get what they expected.</i>

00:10.458 --> 00:12.083
I'm Austin, Edie Britt's nephew.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.375
You're not that hot.

00:13.458 --> 00:15.250
<i>Julie met her new neighbour.</i>

00:15.333 --> 00:17.041
God, I love seeing you laugh.

00:17.125 --> 00:20.500
Oh, well, it's been a long time since
I've been in the mood to. Thank you.

00:20.583 --> 00:22.959
<i>Persistence paid off</i>
<i>for Susan's new friend.</i>

00:23.041 --> 00:25.500
You're gonna leave me out here
in the middle of nowhere?

00:25.583 --> 00:28.667
<i>And Bree began to regret</i>
<i>what she had done.</i>

00:30.417 --> 00:34.250
<i>Orson Hodge dreamed</i>
<i>of the perfect honeymoon.</i>

00:34.333 --> 00:36.041
<i>Indeed, he'd begun planning it</i>

00:36.125 --> 00:40.166
<i>the moment Bree Van De Kamp</i>
<i>agreed to marry him.</i>

00:40.250 --> 00:43.875
<i>They'd start by flying first class</i>

00:43.959 --> 00:47.500
<i>to an exclusive five-star hotel</i>

00:47.583 --> 00:50.500
<i>where they'd spend</i>
<i>their days by the pool</i>

00:50.583 --> 00:53.208
<i>and their nights making love.</i>

00:53.291 --> 00:55.291
<i>And when they returned home,</i>

00:55.375 --> 00:59.834
<i>their perfect honeymoon</i>
<i>would continue forever.</i>

01:01.709 --> 01:03.333
Mrs Hodge.

01:04.500 --> 01:07.125
Yes, Mr Hodge?

01:07.208 --> 01:10.500
Do you have any idea
how happy we're going to be?

01:11.792 --> 01:16.875
I don't need to be any happier
than I am already at this very second.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.375
Oh, my goodness, there's only
15 minutes before our plane.

01:22.458 --> 01:24.166
If you want that latte,
you should go now.

01:24.250 --> 01:25.667
That's a good idea.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.000
<i>The population of homeless teenagers</i>
<i>continues to climb.</i>

01:30.083 --> 01:34.583
<i>This is Andrew. Andrew,</i>
<i>what is it like to live on the streets?</i>

01:34.667 --> 01:37.709
<i>It's not so bad. I mean, you know,</i>
<i>sometimes people give you food.</i>

01:37.792 --> 01:40.333
<i>You can find a lot in dumpsters.</i>

01:40.417 --> 01:43.709
<i>I mean, just last night, I found</i>
<i>almost a whole bucket of chicken</i>

01:43.792 --> 01:45.333
<i>that'd hardly been touched.</i>

01:45.458 --> 01:48.375
<i>Andrew told me</i>
<i>his heart-wrenching story.</i>

01:48.458 --> 01:49.542
<i>An alcoholic mother,</i>

01:49.625 --> 01:52.709
<i>a father murdered</i>
<i>by the woman's boyfriend,</i>

01:52.792 --> 01:54.500
<i>and a childhood shattered</i>

01:54.583 --> 01:58.417
<i>the day his mother abandoned him</i>
<i>on the side of the road.</i>

01:59.667 --> 02:01.333
I'll tell you one thing,

02:01.417 --> 02:05.500
some people just should
never be allowed to have children.

02:09.375 --> 02:11.291
Darling, I got an extra one
just in case...

02:11.375 --> 02:12.375
Bree, what's the matter?

02:12.458 --> 02:15.750
A reporter just did a story on homeless
teens, and my son was one of them.

02:15.834 --> 02:17.542
Oh, my God.

02:17.625 --> 02:20.625
Well, we'll call Child Welfare
the minute we get to the resort.

02:20.709 --> 02:23.375
Orson, you can't imagine
that we're still going?

02:23.458 --> 02:25.125
Darling, the tickets are non-refundable.

02:25.208 --> 02:27.000
My son is eating out of dumpsters.

02:27.083 --> 02:29.208
Well, yes, but think how much better

02:29.291 --> 02:31.667
you'll be able to deal with this crisis
after a nice, relaxing...

02:31.750 --> 02:34.625
Orson, my child is in trouble.

02:34.709 --> 02:36.333
Don't make me choose
between the two of you

02:36.417 --> 02:38.083
because believe me, you will lose.

02:38.125 --> 02:41.291
Now, please, get your ass in gear.

02:45.959 --> 02:50.375
<i>It was at this moment that Orson</i>
<i>realised the honeymoon was over,</i>

02:51.667 --> 02:53.792
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

03:37.667 --> 03:41.291
<i>It was a holiday weekend</i>
<i>on Wisteria Lane,</i>

03:41.375 --> 03:44.750
<i>and everyone was packing their bags,</i>

03:44.834 --> 03:47.750
<i>hoping to get away from it all.</i>

03:47.834 --> 03:50.458
- No, no. All right, bye.
- This is so unfair.

03:50.542 --> 03:53.375
No, no. What's unfair is that
we're slowly running out of money

03:53.458 --> 03:55.166
and you've barely
even looked for a job.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.792
You're gonna have a good time,
all right? I love you. Bye.

03:57.875 --> 04:02.208
<i>Lynette was getting away</i>
<i>from growing tension in her marriage.</i>

04:02.333 --> 04:05.917
You can call it blackmail, Carlos,
but the court calls it spousal support.

04:06.000 --> 04:10.125
So unless I get a cheque by Monday,
your shower buddies from jail

04:10.208 --> 04:12.208
will be throwing you
a welcome-back party.

04:12.291 --> 04:16.125
<i>Gabrielle was getting away</i>
<i>from an increasingly bitter divorce.</i>

04:16.208 --> 04:17.458
Hi.

04:18.166 --> 04:19.709
I'm ready.

04:19.792 --> 04:22.792
So that's my number in case
there's any change in Mike's condition.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.959
I'm going to the mountains
with a friend.

04:25.041 --> 04:29.917
And just in case you were wondering,
it's strictly platonic.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.500
He wasn't wondering.

04:31.583 --> 04:35.583
<i>Susan was getting away</i>
<i>from mounting guilt.</i>

04:35.667 --> 04:38.375
So you can't tell me
anything about my son's whereabouts?

04:38.458 --> 04:39.875
<i>And then there was Bree,</i>

04:39.959 --> 04:42.959
<i>who had just learned</i>
<i>there are some problems...</i>

04:43.041 --> 04:45.000
- Fine.
<i>- ...you can't run away from.</i>

04:45.083 --> 04:46.250
Some reporter.

04:46.333 --> 04:48.583
All she could tell me was
what neighbourhood they found him in.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.375
They don't have
any contact information,

04:50.500 --> 04:52.834
no phone number, no address.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.291
You know, dear, if he had an address,
he wouldn't be homeless.

04:55.375 --> 04:57.166
This really blows.

04:57.250 --> 04:59.709
I am this close
to becoming homecoming queen.

04:59.792 --> 05:02.041
And now I'm gonna be that creepy girl

05:02.125 --> 05:03.750
whose brother's
a pathetic street junkie.

05:03.834 --> 05:06.125
You know, you could show
a little compassion.

05:06.208 --> 05:09.333
Your brother is out there on the streets,
struggling to survive.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.625
And whose fault is that?

05:19.458 --> 05:21.750
Oh, she's right. This is all my fault.

05:21.834 --> 05:23.333
You can't blame yourself.

05:23.417 --> 05:26.959
No parent can stop a child
who's determined to run away.

05:28.458 --> 05:30.291
He didn't run away.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.834
- I kicked him out.
- You what?

05:35.709 --> 05:40.625
I left him on the roadside
with some money and his clothes.

05:41.667 --> 05:45.291
I didn't tell you because I was afraid
of what you'd think of me.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.875
You did what you had to do.

05:51.166 --> 05:53.959
I just wish
you'd said something sooner.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.125
You must know
there's nothing you can't tell me.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.875
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

06:02.959 --> 06:05.458
There won't be. Not any more.

06:07.959 --> 06:10.834
You know, Andrew is not the only one
having a rough year.

06:10.917 --> 06:14.291
I'm the one whose boyfriend
got shot right in front of her.

06:16.917 --> 06:18.917
We'll talk in the car.

06:26.166 --> 06:27.959
Don't you love this?

06:28.041 --> 06:31.667
Oh, God bless Tom for taking
the kids camping this weekend.

06:32.959 --> 06:35.125
This is exactly what we needed,

06:35.208 --> 06:37.166
especially after everything
I've been through lately.

06:37.250 --> 06:39.959
I am all about relaxing
and rejuvenating...

06:40.041 --> 06:41.542
- Gabby?
- Yeah.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.417
- Could you be all about shutting up?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.625
Thanks.

06:46.792 --> 06:48.709
Please don't tell me
you brought your cell phone.

06:48.792 --> 06:52.291
I'm sorry. It's just,
I'm waiting for Carlos' lawyer to call.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.667
This whole spousal support thing's
gotten ugly.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.333
Hello?

06:57.417 --> 06:59.917
- Oh, hi, Tom.
- No. No, no, no.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.959
- Yeah. Yeah, she's right here.
- No.

07:02.041 --> 07:04.667
Hang on. Did you say something?

07:07.208 --> 07:08.375
Hey.

07:08.458 --> 07:13.208
Honey, I know it is your weekend away,
but it's my damn back.

07:13.291 --> 07:15.000
I threw it out again.

07:15.083 --> 07:18.000
- So?
- So I can barely sit up.

07:18.083 --> 07:21.583
The kids are running wild.
I need you to come up here.

07:21.667 --> 07:23.291
Well, why don't you take
a muscle relaxant?

07:23.375 --> 07:26.792
Honey, I've already taken two.
They're not making a dent.

07:26.875 --> 07:28.583
Well, why don't you
give them to the kids?

07:28.667 --> 07:29.709
Lynette.

07:29.792 --> 07:32.375
Please, Tom,
please don't do this to me.

07:32.458 --> 07:37.083
Parker, for the last time,
put down the damn axe.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.667
Oh, all right. Yeah, yeah.
I will be there as soon as I can.

07:45.291 --> 07:47.750
- God, I hate my life.
- I know.

07:47.834 --> 07:50.375
I wouldn't trade with you for anything.

07:53.917 --> 07:56.917
Oh, wow. Look at the view.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.750
Don't you just love
when the leaves change colour?

08:01.834 --> 08:03.375
Well, that's why I suggested this.

08:03.458 --> 08:06.458
So we could hang out for the weekend,
and...

08:06.542 --> 08:08.625
And enjoy the

08:10.166 --> 08:11.458
scenery.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.458
Yeah, scenery's great.

08:15.750 --> 08:19.917
So, maybe I should unpack.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.458
Where should I do that?

08:22.542 --> 08:25.959
Well, there are two bedrooms.

08:26.041 --> 08:27.709
One is mine.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.208
- And there's a guestroom.
- Oh.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.291
- A guestroom. Well, that's handy.
- Yeah.

08:38.458 --> 08:41.834
Unless, of course,
you'd like to sleep in my room.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.417
In which case,
I would take the guestroom.

08:48.333 --> 08:52.709
No, no. I should take the guestroom
because I am the guest.

08:52.792 --> 08:56.166
Yeah, well, it's up the stairs
and at the end of the hall.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.709
Okay.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.250
Susan, I... I think I have your suitcase.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.333
Yeah, and I think I have yours.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.125
So, did you...
Did you happen to see the...

09:30.208 --> 09:31.500
Yeah.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.959
- And did you notice...
- Hard to miss.

09:39.959 --> 09:43.458
- Well, I'm just gonna...
- Hide pathetically in your room?

09:43.542 --> 09:44.917
Me, too.

09:52.375 --> 09:53.834
Hey, Lynette.

09:54.834 --> 09:56.333
What are you doing here?

09:56.417 --> 09:58.458
Kayla called
and she told me about Tom's back.

09:58.542 --> 09:59.792
And my car got impounded again,

09:59.875 --> 10:02.250
so I thought that
I'd hitch a ride with you.

10:02.333 --> 10:03.500
Hitch?

10:04.542 --> 10:07.542
You mean, like, we're gonna be
driving in the car together?

10:07.625 --> 10:10.041
Well, you could strap me
to the front bumper,

10:10.125 --> 10:12.583
but, yeah,
I'd be more comfortable inside.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.542
It's like an eight-hour drive.

10:15.625 --> 10:17.083
So?

10:18.083 --> 10:19.875
How far is the impound lot?

10:19.959 --> 10:23.083
Because, you know,
I could just drive you over there and...

10:23.166 --> 10:27.000
- What's your problem, Lynette?
- I don't have a problem.

10:27.083 --> 10:29.333
I just don't think
we both need to go up there.

10:29.417 --> 10:31.000
I can grab Kayla and bring her back.

10:31.083 --> 10:32.834
Oh, I see your plan.

10:32.917 --> 10:35.125
You just wanna go charging up there
on your white horse

10:35.208 --> 10:36.917
and save everyone,

10:37.000 --> 10:40.125
and then I get to be the rotten mother
who didn't give a rat's ass

10:40.208 --> 10:42.583
and stayed home eating bonbons.

10:43.834 --> 10:45.125
No.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.250
<i>- Due to Lynette's sudden departure...</i>
- Thank you.

10:55.333 --> 11:00.250
<i>...Gabrielle was forced to spend the</i>
<i>last night of her spa vacation alone.</i>

11:00.333 --> 11:02.166
<i>But she didn't mind.</i>

11:04.458 --> 11:09.000
<i>In fact, she looked forward to</i>
<i>a quiet dinner alone with her thoughts.</i>

11:10.166 --> 11:12.250
<i>Unfortunately for Gabrielle,</i>

11:12.333 --> 11:15.500
<i>her thoughts quickly turned</i>
<i>to her impending divorce</i>

11:15.583 --> 11:18.625
<i>and the empty house</i>
<i>she'd soon return to.</i>

11:20.458 --> 11:25.041
<i>And she began to resent</i>
<i>the happy couples she was seeing,</i>

11:25.125 --> 11:26.542
<i>everywhere.</i>

11:28.041 --> 11:30.709
What is this? Freaking Noah's ark?

11:30.792 --> 11:32.500
Wow.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.250
Guess it really is a small world.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.709
Who's there? I can't see you.

11:38.959 --> 11:40.792
You see me now?

11:51.125 --> 11:53.000
How much, baby?

11:54.458 --> 11:56.208
Excuse me, ma'am?

11:58.041 --> 11:59.917
I mean, miss.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.333
I'm looking for someone.

12:01.417 --> 12:03.458
His name is Andrew.
Have you seen him?

12:03.542 --> 12:06.375
Hard to say, boo.
I see a lot of lost boys his age.

12:06.458 --> 12:09.250
Good-looking one, though.
Someone special?

12:09.333 --> 12:12.041
Yes, very,
and I'm worried sick about him.

12:12.125 --> 12:14.709
You might try the soup kitchen
at St Malachi's on Third.

12:14.792 --> 12:18.083
- Well, thank you, Miss...
- Gates. Pearly Gates.

12:18.166 --> 12:21.417
'Cause you can't get to heaven
without going through me.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.959
How very saucy.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.250
- Great piano. Do you play?
- Oh, no, I'm a bit rusty.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.417
Jane loved to sing, so I'd play for her.
But since the accident...

12:38.500 --> 12:39.834
Right.

12:46.542 --> 12:48.000
So...

12:49.417 --> 12:54.375
Brandy, roaring fire.
What could be more romantic?

12:54.458 --> 12:56.834
Well, I can think of something.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.417
Wow, my heart is pounding.

13:01.500 --> 13:04.667
Is that a bad thing?
Consider the alternative.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.583
Your heart is beating
even faster than mine.

13:07.667 --> 13:11.250
I guess I'm excited. It has been a while.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.625
Me, too.

13:22.542 --> 13:27.083
- So, was that okay?
- It was bloody fantastic.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.333
Of course, it's a bit different
than what I'm used to.

13:30.417 --> 13:31.709
Different?

13:31.792 --> 13:34.667
Well, I was with the same woman
for a long time.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.542
Oh, yeah.

13:36.625 --> 13:39.083
But, I mean, you kissed other girls
before that, right?

13:39.166 --> 13:42.083
Sure, but most of them were 12.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.375
As was I.

13:43.458 --> 13:48.000
I met Jane at a school dance,
and after we started dating, well, I...

13:48.083 --> 13:50.208
Well, I never looked at anyone else.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.834
Are you saying that
Jane is the only woman you ever...

13:52.917 --> 13:55.250
Oh, God!
I so didn't want to tell you that.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.709
Why not? I think that's adorable.

13:57.792 --> 14:02.375
Well, I don't want to be adorable.
I want to be dashing and worldly.

14:02.458 --> 14:05.959
Oh, Ian. It's okay.

14:06.041 --> 14:09.625
Some people have a lot of lovers
and some just a few.

14:09.709 --> 14:12.375
It doesn't matter.

14:12.458 --> 14:17.125
Well, seeing as it doesn't matter,
where do you fall on that spectrum?

14:17.208 --> 14:18.542
Huh?

14:18.625 --> 14:21.375
You know,
how many men have you been with?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.917
- Ian.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.333
That was rude. I withdraw the question.

14:25.417 --> 14:27.792
It's not that it's rude.
It's just immaterial.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.834
I mean, it's just a number.
It doesn't mean anything.

14:30.917 --> 14:32.959
- Seeing as it doesn't mean anything...
- Ian!

14:33.041 --> 14:34.959
Well, you know my number.
It's only fair.

14:35.041 --> 14:38.166
Is it more than three?

14:38.250 --> 14:40.250
Nine.

14:40.333 --> 14:42.208
Please, tell me
you were answering in German.

14:42.291 --> 14:46.125
Nine lovers is not a lot.
Nine lovers does not make me a slut.

14:46.208 --> 14:48.417
- Why are you getting upset?
- Because it was really 11,

14:48.500 --> 14:50.583
and I knocked off two,
and you're still judging me.

14:50.667 --> 14:54.041
I'm not judging you. It's just...
Did you work in the recording industry?

14:54.125 --> 14:57.709
Okay, just so you know,
11 is not a lot for a woman my age.

14:57.792 --> 15:01.417
- How old are you?
- What is this, the Gallup poll?

15:01.500 --> 15:04.250
- Hey, where are you going?
- To bed. Alone.

15:04.333 --> 15:06.125
You know, it's something
I've always wanted to try

15:06.208 --> 15:08.792
but I've just never gotten around to.

15:11.041 --> 15:13.166
So, they liked the landscaping
I did here so much

15:13.250 --> 15:18.291
that they hired my company
to do the whole Sinclair Hotel chain.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.291
Your company?
You have a company now?

15:21.375 --> 15:24.250
Oh, my gosh, when I met you,
all you had was a bike.

15:24.333 --> 15:25.542
Well, not only that,

15:25.625 --> 15:28.542
the Gardening Channel's approached
me about hosting my own show.

15:28.625 --> 15:31.917
I mean, we're still
in the talking stages, but...

15:32.959 --> 15:35.834
- What?
- Nothing. I just...

15:35.917 --> 15:39.208
I can't get over
how mature and confident you are.

15:39.291 --> 15:42.750
- You have really changed.
- Thanks.

15:42.834 --> 15:44.875
I was hoping you'd notice.

15:44.959 --> 15:47.542
So, I guess there's no chance
of getting you over to the house

15:47.625 --> 15:51.291
to pick the dead leaves off my ficus.

15:51.375 --> 15:54.458
Yeah, you know, I'm kind of past that.

15:54.542 --> 15:59.458
Besides, I don't think
Mr Solis would approve.

15:59.542 --> 16:03.417
- Actually, we're getting a divorce.
- Wow.

16:04.583 --> 16:07.333
I'm really sorry to hear that.

16:07.417 --> 16:11.542
- Really? Then why are you smiling?
- I don't know. Why are you?

16:13.542 --> 16:14.917
Gabrielle.

16:16.667 --> 16:19.000
It's really great to see you.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.291
Gabrielle.

16:21.375 --> 16:24.875
I think that's the first time
you've ever called me that.

16:26.834 --> 16:30.542
Well, I hope you enjoy
the rest of your stay.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.166
I intend to.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.000
Your cuppy thing is full.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.208
Do you mind if I put this
in your glove compartment?

16:57.291 --> 16:59.375
Yeah, I do mind. I mind deeply.

16:59.458 --> 17:02.291
Jeez-a-marooni. I'll just get rid of it.

17:06.834 --> 17:09.417
Oh, that... Delightful. That's delightful.

17:09.500 --> 17:13.291
Maybe it'll just soak up
the cream soda you spilled.

17:13.375 --> 17:16.041
Why do you always pick on me?

17:16.125 --> 17:18.542
It's like your new favourite game
is "finding fault with Nora."

17:18.625 --> 17:20.917
No, my favourite game

17:21.000 --> 17:25.875
is counting all the things
I'm dying to say to you but I don't.

17:25.959 --> 17:29.834
Like, "Pipe down,
you annoying nut job."

17:29.917 --> 17:32.250
I'd never say that.

17:32.333 --> 17:35.458
- You think I'm crazy.
- No.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.875
You're colourful.

17:37.959 --> 17:42.125
Colourful in a way
that might respond to medication.

17:42.208 --> 17:46.458
Well, you know,
there's levels of crazy, Lynette.

17:46.542 --> 17:50.792
I mean, there are people like me
who just have a big personality.

17:50.875 --> 17:54.291
And then there are the kind of people
who do things like this.

17:54.375 --> 17:57.959
Oh, my God! Knock it off!
What is the matter with you?

17:58.041 --> 17:59.125
What is wrong with you?

17:59.208 --> 18:00.834
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

18:00.917 --> 18:02.667
Oh, lighten up.

18:02.750 --> 18:05.291
- Come on, it was a joke.
- No, well, it wasn't funny.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.834
If you wanna kill yourself, fine,
but don't take me with you.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.917
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

18:10.000 --> 18:12.959
You'd really like that,
if I killed myself.

18:13.041 --> 18:17.125
That is not what I'm saying.

18:17.208 --> 18:20.333
But if you did,
I'd find a way to carry on.

18:26.333 --> 18:29.208
- Pull over.
- Oh, lighten up, it's a joke.

18:29.291 --> 18:31.125
- Pull the car over.
- Nora.

18:31.208 --> 18:34.000
Pull it over!
Pull over or I will jump out of this car.

18:34.083 --> 18:37.250
All right, all right, all right.
All right, I'm pulling over.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.333
What the hell are you doing?

18:39.417 --> 18:43.875
Hitching my way to the campsite!

18:45.166 --> 18:48.041
Nora, you can't be serious.

18:48.125 --> 18:51.750
Shut up! Just get out of my face.
I'm not talking to you.

18:54.083 --> 18:56.625
All right, now, look,
you've gone from crazy to stupid.

18:56.709 --> 18:58.166
This guy could be dangerous.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.417
Well, then it's your lucky day,
huh, Lynette?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.625
Shut up!

19:03.709 --> 19:07.542
See? This is what you do.
You just manipulate.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.792
You wormed your way into my family.

19:10.875 --> 19:14.041
You conned your way
into coming on this trip with me.

19:14.125 --> 19:17.083
And now you wanna force me
into saving you.

19:17.166 --> 19:20.792
Well, forget it. You wanna go, go.

19:43.709 --> 19:46.709
No, I've tried that.
It wasn't enough power.

19:47.709 --> 19:51.000
Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.
All right. Here it goes.

19:53.333 --> 19:55.500
Oh, it worked. I'm a genius.

20:03.625 --> 20:07.208
- Oh, hi. I'm looking for Edie.
- She's out.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.625
Oh, God, where is everyone tonight?

20:09.709 --> 20:13.542
- Anything I can do?
- No, not unless you can fix a fuse box.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.834
My science fair project
blew the power out.

20:15.917 --> 20:20.000
- Oh, what's your project?
- Oh, it's complicated.

20:20.083 --> 20:23.166
Do you think I'm too dumb to
understand your little science project?

20:23.250 --> 20:25.625
It's not little.
I finished third in the state twice.

20:25.709 --> 20:28.375
Now, can you fix the fuse box or not?

20:28.458 --> 20:31.625
Most houses built after 1990
are wired through a circuit breaker.

20:31.709 --> 20:34.333
You didn't blow a fuse,
you tripped a breaker.

20:34.417 --> 20:36.083
Not to challenge
a two-time state science fair

20:36.166 --> 20:38.291
almost-champion or anything.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.208
Let me grab a flashlight.

20:42.291 --> 20:45.750
Maybe you could also grab a shirt,
and some pants.

20:45.834 --> 20:47.917
Pants would be nice.

20:49.917 --> 20:52.125
Susan, can I come in?

20:52.208 --> 20:54.792
I'm with a client. Take a number.

20:55.792 --> 20:57.542
Susan, please.

21:00.542 --> 21:04.083
Everything I said came out
of my own insecurity and fear

21:04.166 --> 21:07.333
that I might...
Well, I might disappoint you.

21:09.041 --> 21:10.792
I was gonna stay mad at you
another hour,

21:10.875 --> 21:13.917
but your damn accent
gets me every time.

21:14.000 --> 21:17.458
- Blimey, you don't say?
- Don't push it.

21:41.166 --> 21:44.709
I don't mean to break the flow,
but I just...

21:44.792 --> 21:48.250
Look, I know that I'm only
your second lover ever,

21:48.333 --> 21:50.250
and I know that means a lot.

21:50.333 --> 21:53.709
And I just don't want it
to mean too much.

21:53.792 --> 21:56.000
I'm not following you.
What do you want it to mean?

21:56.083 --> 21:59.458
I mean, the last time you did this,
it turned into a lifetime commitment.

21:59.542 --> 22:02.875
- I just... I'm not ready for that.
- You think I am?

22:02.959 --> 22:07.417
Well, I assure you, I'm as capable
of having meaningless sex as you are.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.333
I have never had meaningless sex.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.291
So you were passionately in love

22:13.375 --> 22:16.458
and deeply committed
to all 11 of your conquests?

22:16.542 --> 22:19.917
Don't judge me, Mr Virgin, plus one.

22:20.000 --> 22:25.250
Okay, okay, we seem to have gotten off
on the wrong foot again. Susan.

22:25.333 --> 22:29.041
Cheerio? Bob's your uncle?

22:29.125 --> 22:30.625
Get out.

22:32.333 --> 22:34.125
- Can't we at least talk?
- Why?

22:34.208 --> 22:35.750
You know, every time we do,
we just get angry.

22:35.834 --> 22:38.500
Well, we're still getting
to know each other and that's good.

22:38.583 --> 22:40.333
You've learned I'm a tad insecure.

22:40.417 --> 22:42.917
And I've learned,
well, you're just a wee bit touchy.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.333
Okay, Ian, you know what?
This is not happening.

22:45.417 --> 22:49.709
I'm just going to sleep and you can
just drive me home in the morning.

22:59.041 --> 23:02.458
Excuse me. I'm looking for my son.
Have you seen him?

23:03.667 --> 23:05.417
Have you seen him?

23:06.125 --> 23:09.667
Excuse me, young man.
Have you seen this boy?

23:12.000 --> 23:14.542
Andrew. Oh, my God. Thank God.

23:14.625 --> 23:15.834
What are you doing here?

23:15.917 --> 23:17.750
Looking for you.
How did you get that bruise?

23:17.834 --> 23:20.458
- It's none of your business.
- Andrew, please.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.750
Look, shouldn't you be at home,
taking care of your new husband?

23:23.834 --> 23:26.000
- How did you find out...
- I read it in the paper.

23:26.083 --> 23:27.750
You know, the one I sleep under.

23:27.834 --> 23:30.333
Andrew, you have every right
to be angry with me.

23:30.417 --> 23:32.250
But if you knew how sorry I am...

23:32.333 --> 23:34.041
If you came here
sucking after forgiveness,

23:34.125 --> 23:35.291
you came to the wrong place.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.583
Andrew, please,
can't we just talk about this?

23:37.667 --> 23:39.667
I'm your mother, for God's sakes.
You're my son.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.208
No, you dumped your son
at a gas station seven months ago.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.083
I'm somebody else now.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.709
Andrew.

23:49.834 --> 23:51.417
Andrew!

23:51.500 --> 23:53.625
Andrew, please!

23:55.834 --> 23:57.500
Andrew!

24:15.125 --> 24:17.333
What happened to your ride?

24:18.125 --> 24:19.500
The guy grabbed my boob,

24:19.583 --> 24:22.959
so I hit him over the head
with his bong, and I got out.

24:27.125 --> 24:29.000
Look, I'm sorry
I freaked out there before.

24:29.083 --> 24:31.208
It's just when you
made that crack about suicide,

24:31.291 --> 24:33.959
it just kind of hit home.

24:34.041 --> 24:36.917
Oh, my God, Nora.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.875
Did you actually...

24:40.542 --> 24:44.417
Well, I'm very sorry. I had no idea.

24:48.834 --> 24:53.125
But your life is better now, right?
You have a beautiful daughter.

24:53.208 --> 24:58.000
And you have that fun job
at the Pancake House.

24:58.083 --> 25:01.208
- Oh, yeah, my life's better.
- Yeah.

25:01.291 --> 25:05.542
But it's not your life.
Your life's perfect.

25:05.625 --> 25:07.166
Excuse me?

25:07.250 --> 25:10.250
Did you smoke that bong
before you beat the guy with it?

25:10.333 --> 25:11.500
It's just, you have it all.

25:11.583 --> 25:14.166
You have the kids.
You have the career.

25:14.250 --> 25:17.834
You have a husband.
You're Super Mom.

25:17.917 --> 25:19.458
And you think that's easy?

25:19.542 --> 25:22.583
Okay, I have a good life.
Yes, yes, I am very lucky.

25:22.667 --> 25:24.792
But I work 12 hours a day,

25:24.875 --> 25:27.000
and then I come home
to what seems like 33 children

25:27.083 --> 25:29.667
and a husband
who refuses to get a job.

25:29.750 --> 25:32.458
And believe me,
there is not a super mom out there

25:32.542 --> 25:35.125
who wouldn't trade in her cape
for a chance to read a book

25:35.208 --> 25:38.750
and get a massage by a man who has
the decency to leave when it's over.

25:38.834 --> 25:41.667
Okay. Sorry I brought it up.

25:45.208 --> 25:48.750
I'm sorry I said that about Tom.
He's doing his best to find a job.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.542
Well, you know,
maybe he'd try a little harder

25:50.625 --> 25:52.750
if he didn't hate advertising so much.

25:52.834 --> 25:55.041
He doesn't hate advertising.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.250
Last week,
when he came to pick up Kayla,

25:57.333 --> 26:00.458
and he'd just come
from some crappy interview,

26:00.542 --> 26:05.250
he said that he'd hated the ad game
for, like, freaking ever,

26:05.333 --> 26:07.458
and would like to bag the whole thing.

26:07.542 --> 26:09.375
He said that to you?

26:11.959 --> 26:15.291
- He's never told me that.
- He's probably afraid to.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.417
Why would he be afraid?

26:18.500 --> 26:20.375
Probably because
you're the kind of woman

26:20.458 --> 26:23.709
who, when someone says
they wanna kill themselves,

26:23.792 --> 26:25.542
you say, "Go ahead."

26:31.417 --> 26:34.417
- You sure you don't wanna come in?
- No, I'm good.

26:37.583 --> 26:41.583
You really should see what I'm doing,
you know, for next time.

26:46.333 --> 26:49.250
Okay, here's the tripped switch.

26:49.333 --> 26:52.625
So first you move it to "off," to "reset,"

26:52.709 --> 26:54.875
then you press it to "on."

26:56.208 --> 26:58.542
- That's it?
- Yeah.

26:58.625 --> 27:01.125
You didn't have to come
all the way over here to do that.

27:01.208 --> 27:06.375
- You could've just explained it to me.
- Yeah, I guess I could have.

27:06.458 --> 27:10.041
- Well, hello there.
- Edie, hi.

27:10.500 --> 27:12.208
Sorry. He was just...

27:12.291 --> 27:14.166
He was helping me
get the lights back on. I...

27:14.250 --> 27:17.041
- I overloaded my circuits.
- I can see that.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.458
Yeah, so she's doing
some big science project

27:20.542 --> 27:23.333
and she needed me to explain
how electricity works.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.709
I think that's called irony.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.834
- Julie, where's your mom?
- She's on a trip.

27:28.917 --> 27:30.458
- Do you need something?
- Yeah.

27:30.542 --> 27:34.333
Back when I could stand her,
I loaned her my CD player. I need it.

27:34.417 --> 27:36.667
Oh, she took it to the hospital, for Mike.

27:36.750 --> 27:38.125
Oh, God.

27:38.208 --> 27:42.583
This Florence Nightingale act
is really chapping my ass.

27:42.667 --> 27:45.875
Hey, science guy,
I have an experiment for you.

27:45.959 --> 27:50.709
Go home, mix two ounces of gin,
a splash of vermouth,

27:50.792 --> 27:53.750
and see if it improves my mood
when I drink it.

27:57.041 --> 28:00.959
Julie, sweetie, you're a good girl.

28:01.041 --> 28:03.166
Do yourself a favour
and stay away from my nephew.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.625
Oh, trust me, I have no interest

28:05.709 --> 28:08.834
in swaggering,
muscle-bound juvenile delinquents.

28:08.917 --> 28:15.125
Honey, that's what every good girl says
just before she becomes a bad girl.

28:15.208 --> 28:17.208
Trust me. I know.

28:21.542 --> 28:23.959
Just like old times, huh?

28:24.041 --> 28:25.291
Except now when we're done,

28:25.375 --> 28:27.542
I don't have to proofread
your essay on Ethan Frome.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.041
And I don't have to
jump out of a window.

28:29.125 --> 28:31.291
- That's a nice change.
- Yeah.

28:31.375 --> 28:34.375
Hey, how about
I order up a bottle of Dom?

28:34.458 --> 28:36.834
Oh, I like rich John.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.667
Hello?

28:43.750 --> 28:45.583
Oh, hi.

28:46.667 --> 28:50.125
Nothing. You know,
just room service and a movie.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.333
What?

28:52.583 --> 28:55.166
Really? You're kidding?

28:55.250 --> 28:57.250
No, I'm thrilled.

28:58.125 --> 29:01.166
It's room 424.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.500
Me, too. Bye.

29:03.583 --> 29:05.250
- You gotta get out of here.
- What?

29:05.333 --> 29:07.959
- My fiancée's on her way up.
- Your fiancée?

29:08.041 --> 29:09.291
She was supposed to come tomorrow.

29:09.375 --> 29:12.417
Guess she decided to surprise me.
Get dressed.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.250
You're engaged? To who?

29:14.333 --> 29:17.208
Her name's Tammy.
Where's your other shoe?

29:17.291 --> 29:18.417
How could you do this to me?

29:18.500 --> 29:21.166
I would never have let you seduce me
if I knew you were getting married.

29:21.250 --> 29:22.208
What, you didn't have any problems

29:22.291 --> 29:23.375
sleeping with me
when you were married.

29:23.458 --> 29:26.125
You knew about Carlos.
My cheating was upfront and honest.

29:26.208 --> 29:28.792
Look, Gabby,
we don't have time for this.

29:28.875 --> 29:31.250
- Get moving.
- No, I'm not going anywhere.

29:31.333 --> 29:33.083
In fact, I wanna meet
the blushing bride.

29:33.166 --> 29:34.291
Listen to me, okay.

29:34.375 --> 29:37.291
Her name is Tammy Sinclair,
as in Sinclair Hotels.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.375
As in, her father owns
this whole damn chain.

29:39.458 --> 29:42.875
So if she catches you in here,
I am totally screwed.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.625
Poodle!

29:53.208 --> 29:55.542
Look at you, surprising me.

29:55.625 --> 29:58.250
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

30:00.250 --> 30:02.083
This room blows.

30:02.166 --> 30:03.792
Daddy was supposed to
hook us up with a suite.

30:03.875 --> 30:05.792
You know, you're right.

30:05.875 --> 30:07.542
Why don't we go down to the front desk
and demand one?

30:07.625 --> 30:10.375
- Come on.
- Oh, no, they're all booked.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.125
They call this a closet?

30:16.208 --> 30:18.375
Where am I supposed
to put all my stuff?

30:18.458 --> 30:22.291
You know, I could really use a drink.
Why don't we go down to the bar?

30:22.375 --> 30:25.667
I'm wiped. I just wanna stay in.

30:27.125 --> 30:29.667
Didn't you unpack yet?

30:29.750 --> 30:33.583
No, actually, the zipper is stuck.

30:33.667 --> 30:37.542
But they have a guy at the hotel
that can fix it.

30:37.625 --> 30:40.500
You know, I should probably go ahead
and take it down to the lobby.

30:40.583 --> 30:42.750
Now?

30:42.834 --> 30:46.375
- I'm horny.
- So am I.

30:47.709 --> 30:52.917
But I will be a lot hornier
once I get rid of this suitcase.

30:58.542 --> 31:02.166
Poodle, where did
this diamond watch come from?

31:02.250 --> 31:04.166
Oh, shoot.

31:06.542 --> 31:09.250
That's what you get for surprising me.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.709
I didn't get a chance to wrap it.

31:12.875 --> 31:14.583
You like it?

31:15.792 --> 31:17.291
I love it.

31:18.792 --> 31:20.959
I'm never taking it off.

31:21.041 --> 31:22.500
Son of a bitch.

31:23.375 --> 31:25.375
Come here, you.

31:32.792 --> 31:34.250
John?

31:43.834 --> 31:46.166
John, where are you, damn it?

32:02.709 --> 32:05.500
Don't laugh.
I saved a bundle on airfare.

32:31.959 --> 32:34.959
Susan, I'm so...

32:35.041 --> 32:36.542
Keep playing.

33:04.125 --> 33:07.458
- Your azaleas are breathtaking.
- Thank you.

33:08.750 --> 33:11.333
You should be very proud of them.

33:11.417 --> 33:15.500
Yeah, it's nice to know
that I can raise some things correctly.

33:15.583 --> 33:19.291
Darling, be patient.

33:19.375 --> 33:21.500
Andrew will come around.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.709
No, I don't think he will.

33:25.083 --> 33:26.291
I failed him.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.792
I think you're being
too hard on yourself.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.250
And you're not being hard enough.

33:30.333 --> 33:32.875
Stop saying that what I did
was understandable.

33:32.959 --> 33:36.959
I'm a mother who abandoned her child.
It's unnatural.

33:37.041 --> 33:40.375
It's hot, you're tired.
Why don't you come inside?

33:40.458 --> 33:43.000
Because there is a bottle
of Chardonnay in the refrigerator,

33:43.125 --> 33:45.792
and right now,
this little chore is the only thing

33:45.875 --> 33:50.083
that's keeping me from going inside
and drinking the whole damn thing.

33:53.041 --> 33:54.166
Oh.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.500
The azaleas really are lovely.

34:06.291 --> 34:08.500
Yes, they are, aren't they?

34:24.417 --> 34:25.500
Hi.

34:27.333 --> 34:29.875
Look, I'm sorry.

34:34.041 --> 34:35.834
Here's your watch.

34:36.834 --> 34:39.166
Guess I'll just buy Tammy a new one.

34:39.250 --> 34:41.125
Don't you mean
her daddy will buy her a new one

34:41.208 --> 34:42.875
and just launder the money
through you?

34:42.959 --> 34:44.917
I don't blame you for being angry.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.375
All right, I should have told you
the truth from the start.

34:47.458 --> 34:51.291
But when I saw you
there in the moonlight,

34:51.375 --> 34:54.542
it took me right back
to when we were together.

34:55.834 --> 34:57.125
Me, too.

34:59.208 --> 35:01.125
Do you want to sit down?

35:04.709 --> 35:08.250
You know,
you're pretty hard to stay mad at.

35:08.333 --> 35:12.000
Good, 'cause I really
didn't want this to end badly.

35:12.083 --> 35:14.083
Who says it has to end?

35:16.083 --> 35:17.417
What are you talking about?

35:17.500 --> 35:20.250
Well, I'm single now,
and I thought we could maybe...

35:20.333 --> 35:23.583
Gabby, I'm getting married.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.458
Sure, and I was married
when we got together.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.250
Right, but that is not
how I'm gonna be married.

35:31.333 --> 35:35.625
Well, that's what I thought,
but, trust me, marriage is hard.

35:35.709 --> 35:37.333
I know that.

35:38.291 --> 35:42.250
But I love Tammy,
and I don't wanna screw it up.

35:42.333 --> 35:46.250
'Cause enough of those screw-ups
and you just end up alone.

35:50.083 --> 35:52.000
Yeah, that can happen.

36:03.458 --> 36:05.083
Bye, Gabrielle.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.625
Hey, mister,
could you spare a buck or two?

36:21.709 --> 36:23.417
I'm really hungry.

36:27.500 --> 36:29.000
Hey, thanks.

36:29.083 --> 36:32.000
I'll give you $50 more,
you let me buy you lunch.

36:32.709 --> 36:35.333
Fries and a large root beer.

36:38.625 --> 36:40.500
What am I gonna have to do
to earn this?

36:40.583 --> 36:42.375
I told you, I just wanna talk to you.

36:42.458 --> 36:45.750
- You another reporter?
- No.

36:45.834 --> 36:49.250
You a youth pastor?
You trying to save my soul?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.500
You make it sound like a challenge.

36:51.583 --> 36:54.375
No, I just wanna
understand you, Andrew.

36:55.333 --> 36:57.583
Hey, how did you know my name?

37:01.166 --> 37:05.625
You're him, aren't you?
You're the new "husband."

37:05.709 --> 37:06.709
Orson.

37:08.458 --> 37:12.375
If I wouldn't talk to her,
what makes her think I'll listen to you?

37:12.458 --> 37:15.041
Your mother doesn't know I'm here.

37:15.709 --> 37:18.959
All right, Dad.
What do you wanna talk about, Dad?

37:19.041 --> 37:20.959
I wanna know
how you survive out here.

37:21.041 --> 37:22.875
What do you do for money?

37:24.500 --> 37:26.750
I ask. People give it to me.

37:28.709 --> 37:30.083
That's it?

37:31.458 --> 37:33.333
What do you wanna know?

37:33.417 --> 37:36.458
Have I done stuff for money
that I'm not proud of?

37:38.709 --> 37:41.250
Yeah, sure, but you figured that out

37:41.333 --> 37:43.875
as soon as I asked you
what the $50 was for.

37:43.959 --> 37:47.125
But don't tell my mom.

37:47.208 --> 37:51.083
Or you know what? Do. Who cares?

37:51.166 --> 37:52.542
I think part of you wants me to tell her

37:52.625 --> 37:54.875
because you know
how much it would hurt her.

37:54.959 --> 37:57.125
I mean, that's why
you're out here, isn't it?

37:57.208 --> 37:58.417
To punish her.

37:58.500 --> 38:01.917
When will you have
punished her enough, Andrew?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.834
When you turn to drugs
to numb the pain,

38:03.917 --> 38:06.709
or you catch a disease
you'll never be rid of?

38:06.792 --> 38:09.083
Don't pretend
to care about me, all right?

38:09.166 --> 38:12.166
I do care about you,
because Bree cares about you.

38:13.166 --> 38:16.291
And because we're more alike
than you think.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.750
I know about rage.

38:18.834 --> 38:20.834
I know how it eats you up.

38:20.917 --> 38:22.375
But rage goes away.

38:22.458 --> 38:26.917
And when it does, you're just left
with the mess you've made.

38:29.542 --> 38:31.458
Thanks for lunch.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.917
You change your mind,
you know where to find us.

38:52.500 --> 38:56.208
- How's your back?
- If I don't breathe, great.

38:56.291 --> 38:59.500
God, it has been so long
since my back has acted up.

38:59.583 --> 39:02.625
Then, wham, out of the blue,
I'm crying by a tree stump.

39:02.709 --> 39:04.875
Well, you're under a lot of stress.

39:04.959 --> 39:08.583
You got a new kid in the family,
you're job-hunting...

39:08.667 --> 39:10.417
Are we gonna fight about that again?

39:10.500 --> 39:13.291
Because if so, I'm gonna need
those last four muscle relaxants.

39:13.375 --> 39:15.333
No, I don't wanna fight.

39:15.458 --> 39:18.417
In fact, I was thinking,

39:18.500 --> 39:21.500
if you can't find something
you like in advertising,

39:21.583 --> 39:24.375
maybe you should cast a wider net.

39:24.458 --> 39:26.750
Meaning what?

39:26.875 --> 39:30.875
You're a bright guy. Isn't there
anything else you might wanna do?

39:32.625 --> 39:34.709
I'd like to play bass for Aerosmith.

39:34.792 --> 39:37.000
Okay, let's call that the backup plan.

39:37.083 --> 39:40.542
But, seriously,
don't you have some road not taken,

39:40.625 --> 39:43.917
some dream you never got around to?

39:45.959 --> 39:48.750
I don't know. Maybe.

39:48.834 --> 39:50.291
Maybe?

39:50.375 --> 39:53.458
I don't know,
you get married, you have kids,

39:55.667 --> 39:57.750
and lose track of that stuff.

39:57.834 --> 39:59.875
Well, think about it, okay?

39:59.959 --> 40:03.709
'Cause whatever you wanna do,
I'm in your corner.

40:05.792 --> 40:10.333
- Man, did I luck out marrying you.
- Tell me something I don't know.

40:21.500 --> 40:22.875
Hi, Mike.

40:24.000 --> 40:25.458
It's Edie.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.166
I'm sorry that I haven't come by to visit.

40:34.375 --> 40:36.375
Pretty rough luck, huh?

40:39.542 --> 40:45.500
Anyway, I'm here
to pick up my CD player, so...

40:52.375 --> 40:55.458
Well, I hope you feel better soon.

41:10.875 --> 41:12.333
Damn.

41:13.500 --> 41:15.500
And that's with the coma.

41:31.709 --> 41:34.792
<i>We all carry something with us.</i>

41:36.166 --> 41:39.709
<i>Of course,</i>
<i>it's nice if we travel with someone</i>

41:39.792 --> 41:42.125
<i>who can help lighten the load.</i>

41:45.500 --> 41:50.208
<i>But usually it's easier to just drop</i>
<i>what we've been carrying</i>

41:50.291 --> 41:53.959
<i>so we can get home that much sooner.</i>

41:58.000 --> 42:00.709
<i>Assuming, of course,</i>
<i>there will be someone there</i>

42:00.792 --> 42:03.125
<i>to greet us when we arrive.</i>

42:06.917 --> 42:09.208
<i>Why do we clutch at this baggage,</i>

42:09.291 --> 42:12.125
<i>even when we're desperate</i>
<i>to move on?</i>
