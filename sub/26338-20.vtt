00:01.995 --> 00:03.495
Previously, on
"MacGyver"...

00:03.562 --> 00:05.702
Whatever time I have left,

00:06.085 --> 00:07.608
I want to spend it with you.

00:07.735 --> 00:09.756
I promised Mac I'd pick
up his dad after chemo today.

00:09.844 --> 00:11.977
You're not picking up
Oversight in your car, are you?

00:12.064 --> 00:15.155
No. Mac Daddy said
I could drive his new whip.

00:15.533 --> 00:16.960
What the...?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.546
Bye, Jim.

00:20.522 --> 00:21.661
You got to get me
out of here.

00:21.749 --> 00:23.118
I don't know
how much longer I can stay still.

00:23.205 --> 00:24.757
- Is this gonna work?
- It has to.

00:24.920 --> 00:27.491
Three, two, one.

00:27.579 --> 00:29.384
- Bomb fuse?
- That's what's left

00:29.472 --> 00:31.779
of one of the trigger mechanisms
from the device found

00:31.866 --> 00:33.106
in your dad's SUV.

00:33.194 --> 00:35.241
Someone wants to
kill your father.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.804
"Car," C-A-R.

00:53.892 --> 00:54.905
I said steal a car

00:54.993 --> 00:56.257
- and pick me up behindthe royal palace.
- No, you said "vehicle."

00:56.345 --> 00:58.442
"Steal a vehicle and pick me
up behind the royal palace."

00:58.530 --> 01:00.848
- Direct quote, so that's what I did.
- Nobody uses the word "vehicle"

01:00.936 --> 01:02.028
colloquially,
it sounds ridiculous.

01:02.116 --> 01:04.077
So does using the word
"colloquially."

01:05.072 --> 01:06.512
Even if I did say "car,"

01:06.600 --> 01:08.778
which I 100% did not,
how was this the best option?

01:08.866 --> 01:10.637
It's bulletproof,
bombproof and fireproof.

01:10.725 --> 01:12.776
Dude, this thing is rad.
Besides, nothing else was gonna

01:12.863 --> 01:15.014
get us out of that mess
back there.

01:17.068 --> 01:19.083
Okay, fair enough.
But stealing it is what

01:19.171 --> 01:20.489
got us into this current mess.

01:20.577 --> 01:22.278
How does someone
as thorough as you not realize

01:22.366 --> 01:24.645
the Garde rÃ©publicainetracks
the French president's limo

01:24.733 --> 01:26.181
at all times?

01:27.860 --> 01:29.035
Oh, great.

01:29.968 --> 01:32.153
Hey, Matty, I, uh,
assume you heard we're in

01:32.241 --> 01:33.493
- a bit of a pickle?
- Yes, Mac,

01:33.580 --> 01:35.575
you're on every
channel in the EU.

01:35.663 --> 01:36.887
Also, Desi's right.

01:36.974 --> 01:38.239
You did say "vehicle,"

01:38.327 --> 01:39.629
- not "car".
- Okay,

01:39.716 --> 01:42.122
now that everyone's up to speed,
how about you clear up

01:42.210 --> 01:44.022
- this little misunderstanding?
- I'm sorry,

01:44.110 --> 01:46.559
but unfortunately, I don't have
the supreme magistrate's

01:46.647 --> 01:48.382
personal celly on speed dial.

01:48.470 --> 01:50.522
And even if I did,
nothing would change the fact

01:50.610 --> 01:52.575
that you two took
his private limo

01:52.663 --> 01:53.817
for a joie-ride.

01:53.904 --> 01:56.161
Sorry, guys, but if the men
in the ear pieces and the suits

01:56.249 --> 01:57.583
catch you,
there's nothing I can do.

02:04.099 --> 02:06.275
Oh, we just lost a tire!

02:08.527 --> 02:09.658
According to this,

02:09.746 --> 02:11.139
the limo's
titanium-reinforced

02:11.226 --> 02:13.073
run-flat tires should hold up
for about ten minutes.

02:13.161 --> 02:14.731
Well, that's not a lot of time.

02:14.819 --> 02:16.268
Tell us about the car's
other features.

02:16.356 --> 02:17.692
It's built on
a tank chassis,

02:17.780 --> 02:19.877
it's hermetically sealed
in case of a chemical attack,

02:19.965 --> 02:21.276
it's got night vision
headlights...

02:21.364 --> 02:23.673
Like I said: R-A-D rad.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.973
Backup oxygen
tanks, tear gas grenades,

02:26.061 --> 02:28.229
bags of the president's blood
in case he needs a transfusion

02:28.317 --> 02:29.940
- in transit...
- Wait, wait, I got an idea.

02:30.027 --> 02:31.614
Riley, I need you to direct us

02:31.702 --> 02:33.334
to the nearest underpass
or tunnel.

02:33.422 --> 02:34.567
I'm on it.

02:36.121 --> 02:38.129
Sorry!

02:40.230 --> 02:41.869
I'll admit it, Desi was right.

02:41.957 --> 02:43.528
This limo is rad.

02:43.616 --> 02:46.221
Resuscitator masks,
blood transfusion bags,

02:46.309 --> 02:48.350
medical tape, oxygen tanks?

02:48.528 --> 02:50.334
It's got everything
a couple of spies

02:50.422 --> 02:52.122
could need
to make their escape.

02:53.455 --> 02:55.748
Whatever you're doing back
there, Einstein, do it faster.

02:55.836 --> 02:59.153
Faster? You try making
a gas mask at 90 miles an hour.

03:00.211 --> 03:01.407
Desi, there's a tunnel coming up

03:01.495 --> 03:03.735
- on your left.
- Turn... now.

03:03.823 --> 03:05.429
Sorry.

03:10.321 --> 03:11.461
You okay?

03:11.673 --> 03:13.517
Just keep your eyes
on the road.

03:16.548 --> 03:19.462
This stuff doesn't just exist
in James Bond movies.

03:19.712 --> 03:22.538
These are the real deal,
and they'll help, too.

03:22.626 --> 03:25.483
Because now we'll be breathing
the good old O2,

03:25.571 --> 03:28.501
while the French Republican
Guard chokes on fumes.

03:28.731 --> 03:30.167
Au revoir.

Oh, this is one's a lawsuit
in the making.

04:08.411 --> 04:09.794

04:10.005 --> 04:11.341

Thanks, Jim.
Till tomorrow?

04:13.187 --> 04:15.232
..<i>.in daily
contact with us, our children</i>

04:15.320 --> 04:17.599
<i>have disappeared
without a trace.</i>

04:18.269 --> 04:22.130
<i>They haven't responded to calls
or e-mails, or posted online.</i>

04:22.314 --> 04:23.967
<i>This is highly unusual.</i>

04:24.083 --> 04:26.036
<i>We know something is wrong.</i>

04:26.229 --> 04:28.864
<i>We're begging the international

04:28.959 --> 04:32.692
<i>Anyone with knowledge of their
whereabouts, please contact us.</i>

04:34.046 --> 04:36.048
<i>We just want our babies home.</i>

04:45.554 --> 04:47.671
Man...

04:48.105 --> 04:51.891
Another dead end, bringing us
to a grand total of zero leads.

04:52.397 --> 04:54.442
Whoever planted this bomb
in my dad's SUV

04:54.530 --> 04:56.257
went to great lengths
to remain anonymous. Look, man,

04:56.351 --> 04:58.658
you've been staring
at that wreckage for days now.

04:58.790 --> 05:02.301
How about you take a break
to behold Sparky's new skills?

05:02.389 --> 05:04.663
You really reprogrammed him
to assess human emotions?

05:04.751 --> 05:05.999
I sure did.

05:06.089 --> 05:08.450
My hard drive homeboy
can now analyze

05:08.538 --> 05:10.348
eye movement,
body language,

05:10.436 --> 05:12.637
epidermal fluctuations
and a dozen other factors

05:12.725 --> 05:14.489
to determine intent
and feelings.

05:14.577 --> 05:16.723
And he's accurate as hell.

05:16.811 --> 05:18.239
Look.

05:18.991 --> 05:20.858
This footage
was taken in Siena, Italy.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.126
Without knowing any other
details, Sparky will

05:23.214 --> 05:25.155
tell us exactly
what those two guys are.

05:25.243 --> 05:26.855
Would you kindly
shut up already?

05:26.943 --> 05:28.616
I'm trying
to work here.

05:28.924 --> 05:30.733
A side effect
of his new programming:

05:30.821 --> 05:32.499
he's becoming kind of a jerk.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.317
Analysis complete.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.975
Subject One is leaning forward
at a 27 degree angle,

05:40.063 --> 05:41.760
indicating eagerness to share.

05:41.977 --> 05:45.894
Eye movement is 32.6% higher
than human average,

05:45.982 --> 05:48.533
indicating nervousness.
Based on these metrics

05:48.621 --> 05:49.761
and 11 others,

05:49.849 --> 05:52.657
I have concluded that Subject
One is a highly suggestible

05:52.745 --> 05:54.225
intelligence asset

05:54.320 --> 05:56.738
eager to provide information
to Subject Two.

05:56.826 --> 05:57.868
Boo-yah!

05:57.956 --> 05:59.988
That guy's a foreign operative,
and we just watched him

06:00.107 --> 06:02.050
successfully recruit
a Ukrainian asset.

06:02.138 --> 06:03.980
Bozer, this is insane.

06:04.078 --> 06:05.601
I mean, this tech will give us

06:05.689 --> 06:07.753
so many valuable applications
in the field.

06:07.841 --> 06:09.507
- Great job, man.
- What am I,

06:09.595 --> 06:10.722
chopped liver?

06:10.832 --> 06:12.275
My bad. You, too, Sparky.

06:12.363 --> 06:13.949
Whatever.

06:14.339 --> 06:16.119
Hey, uh, you think Oversight
will be so impressed

06:16.207 --> 06:17.595
that he'll give me
a raise for this?

06:17.683 --> 06:18.778
Yeah, good luck with that.

06:18.865 --> 06:20.816
Speak of the devil.
Oversight wants us

06:20.933 --> 06:22.486
in the war room in five minutes.

06:22.574 --> 06:23.957
See you there.

06:26.785 --> 06:28.808
We'll get that raise
one day, Sparky.

06:32.661 --> 06:34.425
<i>Analysis complete.</i>

06:34.513 --> 06:35.607
Who are you analyzing?

06:35.695 --> 06:37.728
<i>Agents MacGyver and Nguyen,
of course.</i>

06:37.816 --> 06:40.808
<i>During observed interaction,
they each experienced</i>

06:40.896 --> 06:43.933
<i>rapid spikes in both heart rate
and epidermal redness,</i>

06:44.021 --> 06:48.113
<i>increases in pupillary dilation
by two and three millimeters,</i>

06:48.201 --> 06:53.684
<i>and held 37.3% more eye contact
than baseline Phoenix employees.</i>

06:53.835 --> 06:55.421
<i>Based on these factors,
subjects appear</i>

06:55.509 --> 06:57.163
<i>to have a mutual attraction,</i>

06:57.251 --> 07:00.148
<i>or what humans commonly refer to
as a crush.</i>

07:00.249 --> 07:01.577
Say what?

07:01.665 --> 07:04.062
Other synonyms
include: having hots for,

07:04.150 --> 07:06.499
thirsting, catching feelings...

07:09.021 --> 07:10.499
Oh, man.

07:10.587 --> 07:13.530
<i>We are begging the international
community for help.</i>

07:13.941 --> 07:17.577
<i>Anyone with knowledge of their
whereabouts, please contact us.</i>

07:19.899 --> 07:21.814
<i>We just want our babies home.</i>

07:25.046 --> 07:26.679
It's a nightmare.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.778
Your kids take a gap
year after graduating

07:28.866 --> 07:32.218
college to travel the world and
one day, they just disappear.

07:32.321 --> 07:33.489
Do we know where
they went missing?

07:33.577 --> 07:34.528
No.

07:34.616 --> 07:35.997
Ben Hagan and Isabel Marx

07:36.085 --> 07:39.280
last called their parents from
BogotÃ¡, Colombia six days ago.

07:39.523 --> 07:42.138
The next day, they missed
their flight off the continent.

07:42.226 --> 07:43.583
No one's heard from them since.

07:43.671 --> 07:44.935
What did
the State Department say?

07:45.023 --> 07:45.966
That they won't launch

07:46.054 --> 07:46.933
- an official search.
- Won't?

07:47.021 --> 07:47.935
Why? Because right before

07:48.023 --> 07:49.747
Ben and Isabel
disappeared,

07:49.835 --> 07:51.630
they told their friends
they were participating

07:51.734 --> 07:54.226
in something called
a No-Go Challenge.

07:54.890 --> 07:55.997
It's a scavenger hunt,

07:56.085 --> 07:57.896
known mainly
in the backpacking community,

07:57.984 --> 07:59.398
where you go to
dangerous places

07:59.486 --> 08:01.255
so you can do even more
dangerous things

08:01.343 --> 08:02.788
when you get there.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.695
- Whoa.
- I've heard about this.

08:05.783 --> 08:08.320
There are No-Go Challenges
on almost every continent.

08:08.476 --> 08:09.796
I mean, Ben and Isabel
must have been doing

08:09.884 --> 08:11.233
- the South American leg.
- Correct.

08:11.321 --> 08:13.616
The State Department advises
Americans not to travel

08:13.704 --> 08:15.398
to most places
on the No-Go list.

08:15.486 --> 08:18.163
Since these kids ignored those
warnings, they won't intervene.

08:18.251 --> 08:20.687
Sending rescuers after Ben
and Isabel sets a precedent,

08:20.775 --> 08:22.296
and encourages others
to take the same risks.

08:22.384 --> 08:23.351
Which is why

08:23.439 --> 08:24.963
the parents appealed
to the public.

08:25.083 --> 08:26.604
- They're out of options. 
- That's where

08:26.692 --> 08:27.726
we come in.

08:27.814 --> 08:29.023
I called the State Department,

08:29.111 --> 08:31.452
convinced them to let us
handle it unofficially.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.288
Now, this isn't
the type of job

08:33.376 --> 08:35.765
that Phoenix
normally does, but...

08:35.852 --> 08:38.195
You're sending us to find them.
And bring them home safely.

08:38.326 --> 08:40.155
How do we know that they're actually
in trouble?

08:40.243 --> 08:41.485
The truth is,
we don't really know

08:41.573 --> 08:43.155
what happened
to Ben or Isabel.

08:43.297 --> 08:44.458
They could've gotten injured,

08:44.546 --> 08:46.393
or run into some
unsavory characters,

08:46.481 --> 08:47.786
or it could be
something else entirely.

08:47.874 --> 08:48.838
The No-Go Challenge

08:48.926 --> 08:50.245
is our only lead.

08:50.333 --> 08:51.245
And since you all

08:51.333 --> 08:53.846
can pass as backpackers,
we're sending you to follow

08:53.934 --> 08:54.932
in their footsteps.

08:55.020 --> 08:56.604
We're gonna do
the Challenge ourselves.

08:56.692 --> 08:59.608
Not to pile on the pressure,
but the clock is ticking.

09:00.079 --> 09:02.104
The longer Ben and
Isabel are missing,

09:02.200 --> 09:04.010
the less likely it is
we'll ever find them.

09:04.097 --> 09:06.995
Remember, this is
an unsanctioned op, so...

09:07.083 --> 09:09.825
No backup, no local support,
and if things go bad,

09:09.985 --> 09:11.628
- we're on our own.
- That's right.

09:11.724 --> 09:13.682
- Any questions?
- Yeah.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.370
How soon can we leave?

09:23.499 --> 09:26.970
âª Hey, ah âª

09:28.245 --> 09:30.651
âª Con puÃ±o arriba tumba
ya toda la muralla... âª

09:30.765 --> 09:33.461
According to the bits
of info Riley found online,

09:33.549 --> 09:35.924
we are not far from the address
where backpackers

09:36.012 --> 09:37.963
start the No-Go Challenge
in South America.

09:38.102 --> 09:40.805
That's our best bet for picking
up on Ben and Isabel's trail.

09:40.893 --> 09:42.643
Out of all of the beautiful
places in the world,

09:42.739 --> 09:44.792
they decided to go
to the slums of BogotÃ¡?

09:44.880 --> 09:47.404
Yeah, definitely not at the top
of my travel bucket list.

09:47.492 --> 09:49.003
Still, I'm glad
they're sending us.

09:49.091 --> 09:50.995
I mean, kids do stupid things.

09:51.083 --> 09:52.706
They don't deserve
to lose their life for it.

09:52.794 --> 09:54.635
I've certainly done
my fair share.

09:54.723 --> 09:57.542
Like steal the French
president's limousine, or...?

09:57.629 --> 09:59.354
At least that served a purpose.

09:59.442 --> 10:01.549
I'm talking about
monumental stupidity

10:01.637 --> 10:03.130
that accomplished
absolutely nothing.

10:03.290 --> 10:04.841
Idiocy of a higher order.

10:04.929 --> 10:06.540
Pretty sure I have you beat
in that category.

10:06.628 --> 10:08.325
I will take that bet,
gadget boy.

10:08.413 --> 10:11.809
Game on.
I was 22 in Tangiers.

10:11.931 --> 10:13.933
On a camel.

10:14.668 --> 10:15.713
Hey, uh...

10:15.801 --> 10:18.208
Riley, I got
to tell you something.

10:18.456 --> 10:21.348
You know how I was programming
Sparky to read human behavior?

10:21.436 --> 10:22.825
- Yeah?
- Well, he analyzed

10:22.913 --> 10:24.614
the conversation
between Mac and Desi

10:24.702 --> 10:26.247
and he concluded that, uh,

10:26.722 --> 10:29.098
Mac and Desi have
a thing for each other.

10:29.186 --> 10:30.184
- A thing?
- Yeah.

10:30.272 --> 10:31.177
You know,
a crush?

10:31.265 --> 10:33.231
The hots? Mac and Desi
are sweating each other?

10:33.319 --> 10:35.700
Yeah, Bozer, I know
what thing you're referring to.

10:35.788 --> 10:37.145
I just...

10:37.692 --> 10:39.262
I'm surprised.

10:40.161 --> 10:41.973
But, if it's true, that's great.

10:42.607 --> 10:43.958
Uh, no.

10:44.046 --> 10:46.137
It absolutely is not great.

10:46.225 --> 10:47.309
Why not?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.067
Mac's awesome,
Desi's awesome.

10:49.155 --> 10:50.559
I don't see the problem.
When Mac's heart

10:50.647 --> 10:52.497
gets involved,
his head gets weird.

10:52.585 --> 10:53.856
You know what happened
with him and Nikki.

10:53.944 --> 10:55.333
Yeah, he wound up
taking a bullet.

10:55.421 --> 10:56.747
Exactly.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.966
And then there was
Deena Feinberg.

10:59.053 --> 11:00.309
Who?

11:00.397 --> 11:03.100
Deena "Fatal Attraction"
Feinberg.

11:03.188 --> 11:05.014
Mac's lab partner
in the 7th grade.

11:05.102 --> 11:06.436
He fell head over heels.

11:06.524 --> 11:07.787
Well, by the time
I realized

11:07.875 --> 11:09.951
why he was offering to carry
her Trapper Keeper

11:10.039 --> 11:12.201
to and from class
every day, it was too late.

11:12.289 --> 11:13.709
And that semester...

11:13.845 --> 11:15.670
Angus MacGyver...

11:16.350 --> 11:18.526
- got a B in chemistry.
- What?!

11:20.742 --> 11:22.414
That's impossible.

11:22.502 --> 11:24.648
Oh, it's possible.
I was there.

11:25.069 --> 11:27.859
Okay, so, a-are you saying
Mac shouldn't date?

11:28.193 --> 11:30.672
No, I'm saying Mac shouldn't
date anyone he works with.

11:30.838 --> 11:32.086
Okay?
In 7th grade,

11:32.174 --> 11:33.260
the worst thing
that could happen

11:33.355 --> 11:34.966
was a slightly
less than perfect grade.

11:35.054 --> 11:37.861
But on a mission... I'd rather
Mac keep his head in the game,

11:37.949 --> 11:38.736
you know?

11:38.824 --> 11:40.130
I hear you, Boze.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.587
I just don't see it.

11:42.788 --> 11:45.799
I hope you're right.
For all of our sakes.

12:05.229 --> 12:06.814
You're sure we're
at the right place?

12:06.902 --> 12:08.596
When you said we were
starting the scavenger hunt

12:08.684 --> 12:11.273
at a skyscraper,
I figured you meant a finished one.

12:11.361 --> 12:13.594
The building's construction
was frozen during the

12:13.682 --> 12:16.549
country's banking crisis;
it's now the world's tallest slum.

12:16.637 --> 12:19.666
Home to 5,000 squatters
who moved in and won't leave.

12:19.846 --> 12:21.275
According to
the No-Go lore,

12:21.363 --> 12:23.437
anyone who wants to participate
in the Challenge

12:23.525 --> 12:24.869
must first retrieve a map

12:24.957 --> 12:26.273
located on the 45th floor

12:26.361 --> 12:28.869
- in a utility closet.
- Did you say 45th?

12:30.156 --> 12:31.418
Let's go.

12:33.095 --> 12:35.088
They finished building
the elevators, though, right?

12:35.262 --> 12:36.486
Riley!

12:47.832 --> 12:49.658
The maps are up ahead
on the left.

12:53.871 --> 12:56.572
These people just decided to
move in and make it their home?

12:56.792 --> 12:59.033
Yeah, I mean, doing
the best with what they've got.

12:59.267 --> 13:01.138
It's pretty awesome,
no matter how

13:01.226 --> 13:02.663
technically
illegal, maybe.

13:02.811 --> 13:05.127
I agree, but everyone
stay sharp.

13:05.215 --> 13:07.611
There's a reason why the
State Department gave this place

13:07.751 --> 13:09.502
a Level 3 Travel Warning.

13:10.843 --> 13:12.105
This is it.

13:12.193 --> 13:14.103
This is where we're
supposed to find the map.

13:22.738 --> 13:24.160
That's no bueno.

13:24.248 --> 13:26.324
Don't tell me we went up
all those stairs for nothing.

13:26.412 --> 13:27.373
My glutes are burning.

13:27.461 --> 13:30.403
I think I pulled a
hammy.

13:32.514 --> 13:35.430
Oh. You looking for these?

13:36.539 --> 13:38.824
Oh, I'll give you
one of these maps...

13:39.254 --> 13:41.132
for everything
you got on you.

13:42.157 --> 13:45.971
Counter offer: one of those maps
and his adorable knife

13:46.059 --> 13:47.268
for me not kicking
all your asses.

13:48.617 --> 13:49.887
She's kidding.

13:49.998 --> 13:52.801
We're just, uh, looking
for some of our friends.

13:53.540 --> 13:54.976
Maybe you've seen them?

13:57.309 --> 14:00.002
Look, just answer a few of
our questions, give us some

14:00.090 --> 14:02.615
of those maps and we'll gladly
give you all the cash we have.

14:03.046 --> 14:05.657
Oh, yeah? Well, this
isn't a negotiation.

14:05.839 --> 14:08.309
We take what we want. Now!

14:24.088 --> 14:25.829
Mac, the maps!

14:25.916 --> 14:28.440
One of mankind's most
effective inventions is also

14:28.527 --> 14:30.398
its simplest: flypaper.

14:30.485 --> 14:33.706
Great for catching insects and
runaway scavenger hunt maps.

14:47.371 --> 14:48.963
Glad you reconsidered.

14:56.697 --> 14:59.775
"Begin your hunt at one
of the four starting points.

14:59.992 --> 15:02.533
"The Challenge you start with
will determine your path.

15:02.621 --> 15:06.439
"At each, sign your name
and get a clue to the next. One:

15:06.674 --> 15:10.017
"bike to Marker 13 of Death Road
in La Paz, Bolivia.

15:10.119 --> 15:12.096
Two..."Wait, Death Road? Hold on.

15:12.184 --> 15:13.267
Let me see this.
"Two:

15:13.355 --> 15:15.885
"cross the Bridge to the Clouds
in Salta, Argentina.

15:15.973 --> 15:18.658
"Three: climb the high-voltage
electrical tower 312

15:18.746 --> 15:20.312
"in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.967
"Four: swim through
Alligator Alley

15:22.055 --> 15:23.579
in Caracas, Venezuela."

15:23.667 --> 15:25.394
I cast my vote for option five:

15:25.482 --> 15:26.987
none of the above.
This is nuts.

15:27.075 --> 15:29.549
Yeah, you're right, Boze,
but we have a bigger problem.

15:29.713 --> 15:32.776
We have no idea which starting
point Ben and Isabel chose.

15:35.595 --> 15:38.213
I don't understand.
I thought the State Department

15:38.315 --> 15:40.026
said that they weren't
going to help us.

15:40.114 --> 15:42.971
The organization that we work
for operates independently from

15:43.110 --> 15:44.909
the State Department.
We have a team

15:44.997 --> 15:47.502
on the ground in South America
searching for Ben and Isabel

15:47.590 --> 15:49.104
as we speak.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.518
I don't know
what to say.

15:53.331 --> 15:55.346
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

15:55.567 --> 15:56.728
We don't have the resources

15:56.816 --> 15:58.846
to follow every path
on the Challenge,

15:58.944 --> 16:00.674
so we need
to prioritize.

16:00.771 --> 16:04.667
Is there anything Ben said
to you regarding any of these

16:04.790 --> 16:06.307
starting points?

16:12.130 --> 16:14.692
In these cases,
sometimes the smallest,

16:14.780 --> 16:17.479
most seemingly
insignificant detail

16:17.567 --> 16:19.177
could make all the difference.

16:24.104 --> 16:25.909
I don't know how this happened.

16:27.210 --> 16:28.854
Last year was fine.

16:29.958 --> 16:31.706
Ben landed a great job,

16:32.284 --> 16:35.113
and then at the last minute,
he turned it down.

16:35.238 --> 16:37.565
Said he was too young
to be stuck behind a desk

16:37.743 --> 16:39.266
and instead was
going to travel

16:39.353 --> 16:41.018
the world with Isabel.

16:41.551 --> 16:42.798
I was against it.

16:42.886 --> 16:45.602
I didn't have the opportunity
to take that kind of adventure

16:45.690 --> 16:46.885
when I was Ben's age.

16:46.973 --> 16:48.846
And he's right,
you know, once you start

16:48.934 --> 16:51.432
with the family, the job,
the whole thing,

16:51.950 --> 16:55.213
it's hard to take the time.
And he's smart.

16:56.528 --> 16:57.940
I assumed he'd be okay.

16:58.028 --> 17:00.854
If I had known he'd be this
reckless, I never would've...

17:03.334 --> 17:06.604
All you can do
is raise them right, trust them,

17:06.856 --> 17:10.598
hold your breath until
you see them again.

17:12.200 --> 17:14.760
It's the curse
of being a parent.

17:16.393 --> 17:18.955
- You have kids?
- A son.

17:21.117 --> 17:23.549
As a matter of fact,
he's on the team searching

17:23.637 --> 17:24.948
for Ben and Isabel.

17:27.041 --> 17:28.323
Which is why
I can promise you

17:28.411 --> 17:31.456
that no stone will be
left unturned, because I know

17:31.544 --> 17:36.120
and believe in my son
as absolutely as you do yours.

17:38.858 --> 17:39.932
We used to call Ben

17:40.020 --> 17:41.987
our Little Monkey Man...

17:42.090 --> 17:44.658
...because he insisted
on climbing on everything.

17:44.777 --> 17:46.049
Since he was three,
we'd find him

17:46.137 --> 17:48.549
on top of cabinets and
bookshelves, remember?

17:48.637 --> 17:51.292
I had to bolt down every piece
of furniture we owned.

17:54.652 --> 17:57.581
My Ben would've started

17:57.669 --> 17:58.966
right here.

18:03.829 --> 18:05.620
And there it is.

18:07.132 --> 18:09.265
I already feel too close
to this thing.

18:09.493 --> 18:11.843
Local news says last month
an Australian girl

18:11.930 --> 18:14.324
was found dead here,
electrocuted.

18:14.583 --> 18:16.229
Cops couldn't figure out
what she was doing.

18:16.317 --> 18:17.838
Well, I bet you if they looked
closer, they would've found

18:17.926 --> 18:19.387
a weird photoshopped map
in her belongings.

18:19.475 --> 18:21.059
Okay, she was definitely doing

18:21.147 --> 18:22.754
the No-Go Challenge.
Question is,

18:22.842 --> 18:25.379
are Ben's parents right that
he and Isabel started here?

18:25.523 --> 18:26.965
I don't see any
security cameras.

18:27.053 --> 18:28.840
The No-Go rules
say to sign your name

18:28.928 --> 18:30.942
at each stop.
If they were here,

18:31.063 --> 18:33.145
their names are up there.
Let's go up.

18:39.256 --> 18:40.692
What's the problem?

18:41.867 --> 18:43.207
I'm afraid of heights.

18:43.295 --> 18:44.629
Come on.

18:45.871 --> 18:48.895
Well, good news is,
if we fall,

18:49.179 --> 18:50.340
it'll be the electricity

18:50.428 --> 18:52.535
- that kills us.
- Ah.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.422
Desi's not wrong.

18:58.510 --> 19:01.383
Those live wires up there
are carrying 5,000 volts

19:01.539 --> 19:03.594
from the generating plant
to people's homes.

19:03.682 --> 19:06.554
If we slip and touch the wrong
thing at the wrong time,

19:06.642 --> 19:09.384
part of Rio will go dark,
and we'll be cooked alive,

19:09.472 --> 19:12.127
so I'm gonna take
a few safety precautions.

19:27.739 --> 19:29.945
Nice work on these
safety harnesses.

19:30.059 --> 19:32.711
How about we
not talk and just climb?

19:33.930 --> 19:37.195
I was just teasing, you know.
You didn't have to come with me.

19:37.300 --> 19:39.219
Yeah, well,
I'm the only one who knows

19:39.311 --> 19:42.555
what we can and can't
touch up here. Besides,

19:42.645 --> 19:45.712
New Year's resolution:
exposure therapy.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.031
Is it working?

19:47.119 --> 19:49.034
I don't know,
I haven't looked down yet.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.638
Can't watch. They're okay.

19:54.726 --> 19:55.771
They're okay.

19:55.859 --> 19:57.774
- What about now?
- Still okay.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.501
- What about now?
- They're okay, Bozer, they're okay.

20:06.057 --> 20:08.146
Just breathe.
You got this.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.071
Hey, there's something
on the discs.

20:10.299 --> 20:11.698
Could be the signatures,

20:11.786 --> 20:12.753
but I can't really
tell from here.

20:12.841 --> 20:14.144
They're insulator strings.

20:14.232 --> 20:17.446
They keep the high-voltage wires
from touching the tower itself.

20:17.534 --> 20:19.519
- Otherwise...
- Zip!

20:19.607 --> 20:21.448
Exactly. It'll...

20:21.651 --> 20:24.003
electrify the entire
structure we're standing on.

20:24.091 --> 20:25.417
How about we avoid
doing that, then?

20:25.505 --> 20:27.072
Good idea.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.253
- The rope.
- Oh, yeah.

20:44.001 --> 20:45.587
On belay?

20:46.066 --> 20:47.454
Belay on.

21:05.228 --> 21:08.899

21:19.633 --> 21:21.898
âª Con chau dem âª

21:21.986 --> 21:24.466
âª Bay gio, la gio âª

21:24.664 --> 21:26.405
âª Con ngu ngon. âª

21:26.493 --> 21:27.625
What are you doing?

21:27.713 --> 21:29.237
My mom used to sing that to me

21:29.325 --> 21:30.340
when I was scared.

21:30.427 --> 21:31.390
I thought that might help.

21:31.478 --> 21:33.312
Surprisingly enough,
it actually does.

21:33.507 --> 21:35.523
I guess so, you made it.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.726
I've got coordinates for
the next No-Go location here,

21:39.906 --> 21:42.023
as well as signatures
written in marker.

21:42.111 --> 21:43.943
- Do you see Ben and Isabel's?
- Not yet.

21:44.031 --> 21:46.404
I can't really see on the other
side of these insulators,

21:46.492 --> 21:48.437
so let me see if I can
get a better look.

21:53.221 --> 21:54.930
Mac! Got you.

22:00.112 --> 22:01.712
I'm okay.

22:02.018 --> 22:04.712
I might ralph, but I'm okay.

22:05.409 --> 22:08.586
You were right.
The ground is not

22:08.836 --> 22:10.579
as scary as the wires.

22:10.667 --> 22:13.024
And I got Ben and Isabel's
signatures,

22:13.121 --> 22:14.946
and some coordinates down here.

22:15.034 --> 22:16.600
But I'm gonna need your phone.

22:16.688 --> 22:18.696
And then, after that,
I want to go

22:18.784 --> 22:21.618
anywhere but here, so...

22:23.820 --> 22:25.821
Now we know where they started,

22:25.909 --> 22:27.235
but what happened to them next?

22:27.323 --> 22:28.788
There's no news reports on

22:28.876 --> 22:29.985
either of them getting
hurt here.

22:30.073 --> 22:32.061
Best guess, they followed
those coordinates

22:32.149 --> 22:34.124
- to the next location.
- Then that's what you'll do, too.

22:34.212 --> 22:35.501
Retracing their steps

22:35.589 --> 22:37.251
- is still our only shot.
- Maybe not.

22:37.339 --> 22:38.938
What if we use the other
signatures up there

22:39.026 --> 22:40.915
to ID more kids
doing the No-Go Challenge?

22:41.003 --> 22:42.719
One of them must have crossed
paths with Ben and Isabel.

22:42.807 --> 22:44.983
- Riley?
- Yep, I'm on it, Matty.

22:45.382 --> 22:49.891
Ten names match people who
flew into South America in

22:49.993 --> 22:51.983
the last two weeks. I'm pulling
up personal info now, Matty.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.379
Sending you contact info.

22:53.466 --> 22:54.602
Start making calls,

22:54.690 --> 22:56.087
and distribute Ben
and Isabel's photo.

22:56.175 --> 22:58.743
Connect me immediately to anyone
who may have seen them.

22:58.831 --> 23:00.050
Excellent work, Bozer.

23:00.138 --> 23:01.587
Thanks, Matty.

23:01.682 --> 23:03.516
Wait, six of those kids
were also booked

23:03.639 --> 23:04.842
on flights that they missed.

23:04.930 --> 23:06.633
Riley, send me the most recent

23:06.721 --> 23:08.670
social media, credit card,
and cellular activity

23:08.758 --> 23:10.430
for those six backpackers.

23:10.819 --> 23:12.001
That's weird.

23:12.089 --> 23:13.612
There's no activity
on any of them

23:13.700 --> 23:15.149
in the last 72 hours.

23:15.237 --> 23:17.563
Six 20-somethings all randomly
stopped using their cell phones

23:17.651 --> 23:19.540
and Facebook accounts
at the same time?

23:19.628 --> 23:20.797
No chance.

23:20.885 --> 23:22.467
Ben and Isabel
didn't just happen

23:22.555 --> 23:23.977
to go missing
on the No-Go Challenge.

23:24.065 --> 23:25.071
Someone's piggybacking

23:25.159 --> 23:26.751
on the Challenge itself
and abducted them,

23:26.839 --> 23:27.946
all of them.

23:28.034 --> 23:29.340
For what?

23:36.379 --> 23:38.196
The next stop
on the No-Go Challenge:

23:38.284 --> 23:41.842
the famous Rio soccer stadium,
Estadio Escanso.

23:41.930 --> 23:44.782
Which is currently
closed for renovations.

23:47.146 --> 23:48.797
At least it was.

24:00.931 --> 24:03.202
All the greats played here.

24:03.290 --> 24:07.188
Neymar, Ronaldo, Messi.

24:07.485 --> 24:09.876
McCartney, Madonna, Bieber.

24:10.048 --> 24:11.884
It's a great
place for an abduction.

24:12.478 --> 24:15.420
Outskirts of the city,
lots of places to hide.

24:15.508 --> 24:17.332
Whoever's behind this
came up with the perfect cover.

24:17.420 --> 24:19.681
Grab kids on the No-Go Challenge
so their families think

24:19.774 --> 24:21.249
they got killed doing
something dangerous,

24:21.336 --> 24:22.804
instead of suspecting
foul play.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.210
And then the world
writes them off the same way

24:24.298 --> 24:25.632
the State Department did
publicly.

24:25.720 --> 24:28.108
If this is where they abducted
Ben, Isabel and the others,

24:28.196 --> 24:29.910
someone could be watching us
right now.

24:30.149 --> 24:31.434
Let's all assume
that's the case.

24:31.591 --> 24:33.655
 Okay,
according to the last clue,

24:33.743 --> 24:34.655
we're looking for a message

24:34.743 --> 24:35.827
on one of the seats
at the bottom level.

24:35.915 --> 24:36.999
So Desi and I
will search that side,

24:37.087 --> 24:38.397
you guys search this side.

24:38.484 --> 24:40.142
Keep your comms on
and your guards up.

24:40.308 --> 24:41.788
Comms on.

24:43.688 --> 24:46.362
See? He just picked her
to go with him.

24:46.501 --> 24:48.364
That was a tactical decision.

24:48.517 --> 24:50.884
Their skill sets complement
each other, don't you think?

24:50.972 --> 24:52.774
And 'cause they like each other.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.540
What's up with you
that you can't see this?

24:54.628 --> 24:56.282
I'm telling you,
disaster's imminent.

24:56.446 --> 24:58.124
Even their couple
name says so.

24:58.212 --> 25:00.680
Mac plus Desi equals "Messy."

25:00.767 --> 25:03.901
Actually, Mac plus Desi
equals... "Mesi."

25:04.032 --> 25:06.173
Don't nitpick, okay?
You get my point.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.339
Okay, you want to talk
stupid decisions?

25:08.427 --> 25:10.507
I hiked into the crater
of an active volcano

25:10.595 --> 25:11.595
on a dare once.

25:11.683 --> 25:14.811
Burned my feet pretty bad,
lost a good pair of boots,

25:14.899 --> 25:16.899
and I got thrown in the brig
back at base,

25:16.993 --> 25:18.345
but I won my bet.

25:18.433 --> 25:21.110
I once took a full bite out of
a Carolina Reaper pepper...

25:21.212 --> 25:22.993
Hottest pepper
in the world, by the way...

25:23.081 --> 25:24.100
And swallowed it.

25:24.188 --> 25:25.464
I couldn't see for two days.

25:25.552 --> 25:26.837
That is dumb.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.532
Thank you.

25:34.681 --> 25:37.618
You did a nice job comforting
Ben's parents earlier.

25:38.118 --> 25:40.204
Not easy at a time like this.

25:40.712 --> 25:42.173
Well, it's not in
my job description,

25:42.261 --> 25:44.454
but if we can ease
the family's pain,

25:44.643 --> 25:46.220
all the better.

25:47.856 --> 25:50.033
It's unusual that you would
choose to divulge

25:50.121 --> 25:53.032
that one of the agents
on the mission is your son.

25:53.472 --> 25:56.015
I wanted to let them know
what we're in this together.

25:56.103 --> 25:58.188
That I understand
how they feel,

25:58.735 --> 26:00.305
'cause I feel the same way

26:00.392 --> 26:02.176
every time Angus is
out in the field.

26:02.263 --> 26:03.452
You didn't used to.

26:03.540 --> 26:05.483
You've sent Mac on scores
of missions,

26:05.571 --> 26:08.600
but it's not till recently
you started monitoring

26:08.688 --> 26:10.728
his ops from this room.

26:11.259 --> 26:13.975
My diagnosis has reminded me

26:14.063 --> 26:15.494
that life is fragile.

26:15.711 --> 26:17.897
My priority used to be
mission success,

26:17.985 --> 26:21.821
but now, all I want is
to make sure that

26:22.149 --> 26:24.173
Angus gets home safe.

26:25.668 --> 26:29.991
If we could just
keep that between us,

26:30.079 --> 26:31.220
Director Webber.

26:31.308 --> 26:33.049
I want the team to think
I'm a good boss,

26:33.137 --> 26:35.890
not some big softy.

26:35.978 --> 26:38.181
Believe me, Jim,
no one thinks that.

26:38.563 --> 26:40.243
The fact that you
secretly are

26:40.553 --> 26:42.579
is what makes you a good boss.

26:44.978 --> 26:46.830
No message yet,
just...

26:46.917 --> 26:50.050
gum, soda cans and...

26:51.141 --> 26:52.438
What is this?

26:52.526 --> 26:53.788
A vuvuzela.

26:54.259 --> 26:56.361
Air horn.
They should be outlawed.

26:56.448 --> 26:59.204
Nothing more distracting to the
players of this beautiful game.

26:59.292 --> 27:01.337
Don't you have one
of these in your room?

27:02.106 --> 27:03.411
Two, actually.

27:03.498 --> 27:04.674
But it's okay to use 'em

27:04.761 --> 27:06.140
when the other team
has the ball.

27:06.228 --> 27:07.501
Mm-hmm.

27:07.615 --> 27:11.665
It was negative 25 degrees,
shark-infested waters,

27:11.753 --> 27:13.030
and I had no wetsuit.

27:13.118 --> 27:14.249
How is that for
a stupid decision?

27:14.422 --> 27:16.134
That's insane.

27:16.222 --> 27:18.095
Ho! I got something.

27:19.210 --> 27:20.725
Riley, Bozer,
I have the coordinates

27:20.813 --> 27:21.860
for the next No-Go location.

27:21.948 --> 27:23.686
Any sign Ben
and Isabel were there?

27:23.774 --> 27:25.172
Yeah, they signed their names,

27:25.259 --> 27:26.673
along with a dozen other kids.

27:26.761 --> 27:28.376
Some of these names
match the ones I saw

27:28.503 --> 27:30.819
- at the high-voltage field.
- But is this where they were abducted?

27:30.907 --> 27:32.376
I think we can answer
that question.

27:32.464 --> 27:33.657
There's a black van
approaching

27:33.790 --> 27:35.360
the north entrance
of the stadium.

27:35.448 --> 27:36.579
He's coming in hot.
On our way.

27:36.836 --> 27:38.313
Everyone hold their positions.

27:38.401 --> 27:40.397
Apprehending these guys
could be our only chance

27:40.485 --> 27:41.454
at finding Ben and Isabel.

27:41.542 --> 27:42.876
Show our hand too quickly,
we could spook 'em.

27:42.964 --> 27:44.662
So, until they get close,
Desi and I are just

27:44.750 --> 27:46.858
thrill-seeking backpackers
on the No-Go Challenge. Copy?

27:46.946 --> 27:48.469
Copy.

27:54.263 --> 27:55.672
Can I help you guys?

27:55.931 --> 27:58.063
Angus, behind you!

28:08.316 --> 28:11.014
Bozer, Riley,
Mac and Desi are in trouble.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.419
Forget Ronaldo.
The next jersey I get

28:41.507 --> 28:43.030
is gonna say "Davis."

28:50.207 --> 28:52.394
They're not talking. That's okay.

28:52.482 --> 28:54.160
Cell phones will tell us
everything we need to know.

28:54.279 --> 28:57.535
Riley? Yeah, all of them
recently called someone

28:57.623 --> 28:59.214
less than a mile from here.
I'm gonna activate

28:59.302 --> 29:01.003
that phone's camera
to see who's using it.

29:01.105 --> 29:03.207
<i>Same departure point as usual.</i>

29:03.295 --> 29:06.230
- <i>See you there.</i>
- Gotcha. Matty, I'm sending you a photo.

29:06.853 --> 29:09.003
Running facial rec now.

29:13.628 --> 29:15.152
We have a match.

29:15.239 --> 29:17.937
Derek Diresta, human trafficker,

29:18.024 --> 29:20.043
active in South America.
INTERPOL's been

29:20.183 --> 29:21.593
chasing this guy
for years.

29:21.714 --> 29:24.798
He abducts and sells
people for forced labor,

29:24.886 --> 29:26.449
farming, mining,

29:26.537 --> 29:27.746
domestic servitude.

29:27.834 --> 29:30.053
Their intel says he got
a request for English speakers

29:30.141 --> 29:32.072
right before Ben and Isabel
disappeared.

29:32.160 --> 29:33.712
Well,
based on proximity and timing,

29:33.800 --> 29:34.878
that's not a coincidence.

29:34.966 --> 29:37.738
Got his location. He's in
a farmhouse outside the city.

29:37.910 --> 29:40.126
Ben, Isabel
and the other abducted kids

29:40.214 --> 29:41.047
must be
in there, too.

29:41.134 --> 29:43.277
I'll tip local PD, have them
pick up those abductors.

29:43.365 --> 29:44.541
You get to the farmhouse.

29:44.629 --> 29:46.704
Guys, wait. He's still
talking to someone.

29:46.792 --> 29:48.839
Get the boats docked.
We move them in 30.

29:48.949 --> 29:51.797
He's talking about the backpackers.
He's gonna move them.

29:51.884 --> 29:52.842
If we don't
make it there now,

29:52.929 --> 29:54.597
we'll never see
those kids again.

30:08.359 --> 30:10.057
Diresta's in that farmhouse.

30:10.145 --> 30:12.938
Given the tight security,
I would say our hunch is correct.

30:13.026 --> 30:14.405
Ben, Isabel and the other kids

30:14.493 --> 30:15.702
must be in there, too.

30:15.790 --> 30:16.735
Not for long, Matty.

30:16.822 --> 30:17.881
They're blacking out
the van windows

30:17.969 --> 30:18.751
so you can't see inside.

30:18.839 --> 30:21.370
Once that van leaves
the property, we risk losing

30:21.458 --> 30:22.289
those kids for good.

30:22.377 --> 30:23.889
You've got to get inside
and rescue them...

30:23.977 --> 30:25.135
- before that happens.
- How?

30:25.222 --> 30:27.436
We're outnumbered, no backup,
and breaking in risks

30:27.524 --> 30:29.008
alerting the guards,
who might hurt the kids.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.798
If we can't break in, we're
gonna have to convince them

30:30.915 --> 30:32.533
to let us in.

30:33.823 --> 30:35.085
You really think this will work?

30:35.188 --> 30:36.799
Yeah, sure.
At least,

30:36.886 --> 30:38.496
until these guys
start wondering why we wore

30:38.583 --> 30:40.210
these itchy masks
the entire drive

30:40.298 --> 30:41.483
from the stadium.

30:41.571 --> 30:42.967
You guys all right back there?

30:43.055 --> 30:45.563
Just peachy.
Never better.

30:54.344 --> 30:55.946
How do we get
them to open the gate?

30:56.034 --> 30:57.727
They won't recognize our voices.

31:55.616 --> 31:57.140
All right.

31:57.227 --> 31:58.507
Let's get these guys
in the back.

32:00.491 --> 32:02.406
Okay, we're in.
What do you see?

32:02.493 --> 32:03.675
A No-Go.

32:03.763 --> 32:04.763
South America map

32:04.851 --> 32:06.497
with all four routes
fully charted out.

32:06.585 --> 32:10.459
Along with detailed research
on each No-Go location.

32:10.547 --> 32:12.810
This is how they knew
the best places to abduct kids.

32:12.898 --> 32:15.800
Guys, I have work orders over
here, for where to send them.

32:15.888 --> 32:16.942
And No-Go maps

32:17.029 --> 32:18.271
for other continents. Asia,

32:18.359 --> 32:20.495
Europe, North America.
Looks like Diresta plans

32:20.583 --> 32:21.886
to expand his business
and piggyback

32:21.974 --> 32:23.370
on other Challenges.

32:23.458 --> 32:25.646
Guys.

32:28.725 --> 32:31.597
Matty, Diresta's
got the kids in a dark room

32:31.685 --> 32:33.600
with cinder block walls.
I'm guessing it's the basement.

32:33.694 --> 32:34.997
Go get them.

32:35.091 --> 32:36.630
But Mac, be careful.

32:36.718 --> 32:37.850
If he hears you coming,

32:37.938 --> 32:39.701
he could hurt those kids,
or worse.

32:39.818 --> 32:41.091
Yeah.

32:42.419 --> 32:44.372
I got an idea.
Help me search these backpacks

32:44.460 --> 32:45.766
for sleeping bag
stuff sacks.

32:45.888 --> 32:48.560
Polyurethane inside
with a siliconized outside.

32:51.256 --> 32:52.605
Just check the tags.

32:52.693 --> 32:53.747
If it says "waterproof,"

32:53.841 --> 32:55.716
it'll also be airtight.

33:05.678 --> 33:07.474
Mac, got one.

33:08.325 --> 33:11.896
Oh, yeah, this'll work
as a face mask.

33:11.997 --> 33:14.652
Now I just need something toxic
but not lethal to fill it with.

33:14.740 --> 33:17.037
How about this?

33:41.187 --> 33:43.348
There's kids handcuffed
in rooms down the hall.

33:43.436 --> 33:44.601
We'll go free them.

33:45.574 --> 33:46.726
We'll take care of Diresta.

33:46.814 --> 33:47.990
Okay.

33:51.077 --> 33:55.171
Your time here is almost over.

33:55.873 --> 33:57.247
Soon, you will be placed

33:57.335 --> 34:01.003
in your new... situations.

34:01.788 --> 34:02.950
Please don't make

34:03.038 --> 34:05.147
the process difficult
for our clients.

34:05.235 --> 34:07.936
We guarantee our products,

34:08.208 --> 34:10.248
and we discard...

34:10.619 --> 34:12.404
...returned items.

34:30.414 --> 34:33.058
Hey, Bozer and I
locked up the guards.

34:33.683 --> 34:35.072
All right,
good news, Matty.

34:35.159 --> 34:37.830
We've captured Diresta
and we're freeing the kids now.

34:37.918 --> 34:39.855
They look shook,
but they'll be okay.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.516
We're here to help. All right?
You guys are gonna be okay.

34:42.605 --> 34:45.478
Hold up, Mac. We have a problem.
Ben and Isabel aren't here.

34:45.565 --> 34:46.744
Where are they?

34:46.831 --> 34:48.092
The Americans?

34:48.179 --> 34:50.465
Their faces were
all over the TV.

34:50.647 --> 34:52.340
They got too famous.

34:52.428 --> 34:53.650
What does that mean?

34:53.737 --> 34:55.612
It means they're gonna
kill Ben and Isabel.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.715
Mac, I think we got them.

35:01.803 --> 35:05.244
Matching green van heading north
on BR-40, just past.

35:05.332 --> 35:08.635
Exit 12. This must be Diresta's
men with Ben and Isabel.

35:08.722 --> 35:10.394
BR-40?

35:11.193 --> 35:13.282
They're headed for the
high-voltage transmission field.

35:13.370 --> 35:14.641
They're gonna make it look like

35:14.728 --> 35:16.199
Ben and Isabel died on
the No-Go Challenge.

35:16.287 --> 35:19.051
Okay, you two stay here,
coordinate with the local PD

35:19.139 --> 35:20.967
to get these kids
to a hospital ASAP.

35:21.055 --> 35:22.949
You and I, we're going
after Ben and Isabel.

35:23.090 --> 35:24.785
They got a
pretty good head start.

35:24.990 --> 35:26.910
How you gonna make up the time?

35:29.072 --> 35:30.605
How about these?

35:31.471 --> 35:34.277
Shortest distance
between A and B is off-road.

35:36.827 --> 35:38.925
Isabel?

35:39.810 --> 35:41.433
I'm sorry.

35:42.007 --> 35:44.215
I wish I would've
never talked you into this.

35:44.629 --> 35:45.965
It's okay, Ben.

35:46.053 --> 35:48.055
Just hold my hand.

35:51.510 --> 35:54.283
You were right, Mac.
Diresta's men are approaching

35:54.389 --> 35:56.117
the electrical tower
with Ben and Isabel.

35:56.205 --> 35:57.249
Almost there.

35:57.336 --> 35:58.816
Almost there isn't good enough.

36:03.515 --> 36:05.517
Mac, there's no entrance
on this side.

36:05.605 --> 36:06.737
We're gonna have to go
all the way around.

36:06.824 --> 36:08.347
No time for that.

36:10.826 --> 36:11.871
Guys,

36:11.959 --> 36:12.917
we're gonna lose this.

36:13.005 --> 36:14.951
- Where are you?
- Close!

36:37.223 --> 36:38.703
It's okay.

36:38.791 --> 36:40.532
It's okay. You're safe now.

36:40.814 --> 36:42.033
You're safe.

36:59.268 --> 37:02.619
<i>âª Down to the wire âª</i>

37:05.535 --> 37:10.369
<i>âª There in the fire, yeah âª</i>

37:11.033 --> 37:12.978
<i>âª Ooh... âª</i>

37:24.322 --> 37:28.697
<i>âª When all is lost âª</i>

37:28.909 --> 37:34.439
<i>âª I will stay with you âª</i>

37:34.564 --> 37:37.557
<i>âª I will stand âª</i>

37:37.721 --> 37:40.231
<i>âª With you âª</i>

37:40.635 --> 37:45.658
<i>âª Like I always do âª</i>

37:47.256 --> 37:52.299
<i>âª Every battle
that we've been through âª</i>

37:52.500 --> 37:56.658
<i>âª I will stand with you âª</i>

37:56.746 --> 37:57.878
You a'ight, Dad?

37:59.689 --> 38:00.819
I am now.

38:01.840 --> 38:03.605
We should get out of here

38:03.723 --> 38:04.807
before they start
asking questions.

38:04.895 --> 38:06.070
Good idea.

38:07.564 --> 38:08.916
Oh, been thinking, Jim,

38:09.004 --> 38:11.789
isn't it time you gave
your employees a vacation?

38:11.877 --> 38:13.183
You know,
something beachy.

38:13.271 --> 38:15.299
May I suggest Tahiti?

38:17.346 --> 38:18.564
Keep dreaming, Bozer.

38:18.799 --> 38:20.525
Uh, okay. What about Fiji?

38:20.613 --> 38:22.377
Uh, Bali? Bora Bora?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.244
Compton?

38:27.120 --> 38:29.237
<i>Tears of joy today
when nearly a dozen</i>

38:29.325 --> 38:31.347
<i>missing young travelers
were reunited</i>

38:31.435 --> 38:33.519
<i>with their families
after being rescued</i>

38:33.666 --> 38:35.354
<i>from an overseas abduction ring.</i>

38:35.442 --> 38:36.852
<i>Now, who exactly found them</i>

38:36.940 --> 38:39.933
<i>and brought them home
remains unknown at this time.</i>

38:40.894 --> 38:42.374
And it gets better.

38:42.462 --> 38:43.800
Faced with a life sentence,

38:43.888 --> 38:46.847
Derek Diresta flipped
on his overseas counterparts.

38:47.043 --> 38:49.098
Phoenix is coordinating
with INTERPOL to rip

38:49.186 --> 38:51.292
the entire operation
out by the roots.

38:51.380 --> 38:52.903
Countries worldwide

38:52.990 --> 38:55.229
are working to stop
the No-Go Challenge.

38:55.317 --> 38:57.214
'Cause let's face it,
young people don't need

38:57.302 --> 38:59.425
any more encouragement
to do stupid things.

38:59.608 --> 39:01.392
Amen to that.

39:02.035 --> 39:03.237
Hey, guys.

39:03.450 --> 39:05.003
- Hey.
- Desi.

39:05.295 --> 39:06.665
Glad you could stop by.

39:06.753 --> 39:08.237
Still think
it's all in my head?

39:08.325 --> 39:09.630
I did at first.

39:09.718 --> 39:11.347
But you don't wear a dress
like that on accident.

39:11.475 --> 39:12.761
Sparky was right.

39:12.849 --> 39:14.372
- It's on.
- Like I said.

39:14.460 --> 39:17.158
Mac and Desi?
Messy.

39:17.246 --> 39:18.690
This is getting to be

39:18.778 --> 39:20.183
a theme with you.
You can't have one beer?

39:20.271 --> 39:21.987
I hear you, but
I just stopped by

39:22.075 --> 39:23.946
to say great job, everyone.

39:24.337 --> 39:25.878
I can't stay.
I'm running late.

39:25.966 --> 39:28.433
- Ah. Got plans?
- Yeah. A date.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.394
Ah. Well, have fun.

39:32.521 --> 39:33.827
Thanks.

39:36.329 --> 39:37.721
- See you all tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.386
- Bye.
- See you.

39:42.578 --> 39:44.379
So I guess we're safe, right?

39:48.237 --> 39:49.785
I'm not so sure.

39:51.113 --> 39:52.614
Oh, no.
