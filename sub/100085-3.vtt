IfI was under his thumb,
I'd be afraid,

39:51.000 --> 39:52.991
whether he was
in jail or not.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.787
I'd want help.
Protection.

39:55.790 --> 39:57.496
And you'd be willing
to do me a solid, huh?

39:57.500 --> 40:00.663
If you help me find
Feeney's killer.

40:00.670 --> 40:03.616
Before he kills you.
[ Sighs ]

40:03.620 --> 40:05.872
This offer's for right here,
right now.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.529
Tomorrow?

40:07.540 --> 40:11.032
I come after you.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.373
Just do me a favor --
leave Dex out of this,

40:14.380 --> 40:17.531
whatever it is
you think you're doing.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.201
[ Knock on door ]

40:23.830 --> 40:25.320
[ Door closes ]

40:25.330 --> 40:27.491
[ Siren wailing distantly ]

40:34.710 --> 40:36.450
[ Foot tapping ]

40:36.460 --> 40:37.575
[ Sighs ]

40:41.040 --> 40:42.530
Ah!
[ Tape deck whirs ]

40:42.540 --> 40:44.496
[ Snap!'s "The Power" plays ]

40:46.250 --> 40:47.911
I've got the power

40:47.920 --> 40:49.535
Power

40:52.620 --> 40:53.917
[ Engine starts ]

40:53.920 --> 40:55.740
I've got the power

40:55.750 --> 40:57.706
Power

40:57.710 --> 40:59.826
[ Knock on door ]

40:59.830 --> 41:01.912
Hey.

41:01.920 --> 41:02.989
Um...

41:03.000 --> 41:03.910
I've got the power

41:03.920 --> 41:05.956
Today, I got beat.

41:05.960 --> 41:08.872
I lost. We lost.

41:08.880 --> 41:12.372
Artie sold me out,
and it [exhales sharply]

41:12.380 --> 41:13.995
it pisses me off,
and it pisses me off

41:14.000 --> 41:18.414
that my mistake
could cost you your child.

41:18.420 --> 41:20.786
But they're not gonna
get away with this, okay?

41:20.790 --> 41:22.030
No, they think
we're just gonna lie down

41:22.040 --> 41:24.531
and we're gonna take it.

41:24.540 --> 41:26.110
Yeah, you know,
they have the power

41:26.120 --> 41:28.327
and they have
the influence and...

41:28.330 --> 41:29.376
But you know what?

41:29.380 --> 41:31.166
They're arrogant
sons of bitches,

41:31.170 --> 41:33.161
and they don't know that women
like us have been fighting

41:33.170 --> 41:35.491
our entire lives
for everything.

41:37.790 --> 41:39.030
Randall's gonna pay,

41:39.040 --> 41:41.076
and Artie's gonna pay
for what he did.

41:41.080 --> 41:43.878
And I...

41:43.880 --> 41:44.949
I won't lose again.

41:44.960 --> 41:46.780
I've got the power
