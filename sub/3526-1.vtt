01:41.968 --> 01:45.096
Nobody ever went broke underestimating
the taste of the American public.

02:03.556 --> 02:08.550
The ancient Egyptians
postulated seven souls.

02:08.595 --> 02:12.395
The top soul and the first to leave
at the moment of death

02:12.432 --> 02:16.596
is Ren:
the Secret Name.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.605
This corresponds
to my Director.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.574
He directs
the film of your life

02:22.609 --> 02:25.305
from conception
to death.

02:25.345 --> 02:30.442
''The Secret Name''
is the title of your film.

02:30.483 --> 02:35.113
When you die,
that's where Ren came in.

02:39.926 --> 02:42.486
Second soul
and second one

02:42.529 --> 02:45.794
off the sinking ship
is Sekem:

02:45.832 --> 02:50.166
Energy, Power, Light.
The Director gives the orders,

02:50.203 --> 02:53.229
Sekem presses
the right buttons.

03:03.616 --> 03:08.110
Number three is Khu:
the Guardian Angel.

03:08.154 --> 03:12.284
He, she or it
is third man out.

03:12.325 --> 03:15.886
Number four is Ba:
the Heart--

03:15.929 --> 03:18.022
often treacherous.

03:23.970 --> 03:27.235
Number five is Ka:
the Double.

03:27.273 --> 03:30.436
The Ka, which usually
reaches adolescence

03:30.476 --> 03:32.467
at the time
of bodily death,

03:32.512 --> 03:36.505
is the only reliable guide
through the Land of the Dead.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.476
Who's gonna live here?

03:40.520 --> 03:44.217
A family. l'll have it
finished by October.

03:48.795 --> 03:51.286
- l'm worried, Ade.
- Everybody's worried.

03:51.331 --> 03:55.893
No. l am worried
all the time.

04:04.077 --> 04:09.310
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

04:09.349 --> 04:14.184
your whole past conditioning from this and
other lives.

04:17.656 --> 04:22.321
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.

04:26.866 --> 04:29.300
l'm halfway to China.
There's nothing here.

04:29.335 --> 04:31.394
40,000 l had--

04:31.437 --> 04:34.099
my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

04:34.140 --> 04:35.732
Did you wrap it right?

04:35.775 --> 04:37.834
lt gets moldy--
it could've disintegrated.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.504
- Wrap what?
- The money.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.439
He knows l need that money
for my fucking retrial!

04:44.484 --> 04:46.042
- Who?
- You know who.

04:46.085 --> 04:48.485
No, l don't know who.
That's why l asked you.

04:48.521 --> 04:51.615
- Malanga.
- Will you stop with that?

04:51.658 --> 04:54.218
Pussy Malanga's dead
six years now.

04:54.260 --> 04:56.353
l should dig him up
already!

05:00.300 --> 05:03.895
Moles. They chewing
through your sprinklers too?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.506
40,000 l had--

05:07.540 --> 05:09.872
my share of the Bohack's haul
from the '70s.

05:09.909 --> 05:13.675
We'll look later.
You're gonna be late for your doctor's.

05:13.713 --> 05:15.408
Come on.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.122
Hello?

05:28.161 --> 05:29.992
Let me ask you something:

05:30.029 --> 05:31.758
ls your time more valuable
than mine?

05:31.798 --> 05:33.561
Where's the baby?

05:33.599 --> 05:36.432
Sorry, Ton'. The car seat,
the other stuff--

05:36.469 --> 05:38.437
packin' it in there
takes forever.

05:38.471 --> 05:40.439
You probably
remember that.

05:40.473 --> 05:42.304
No, l don't.
l didn't do that crap.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.276
How are you feeling,
Uncle Jun', huh?

05:44.310 --> 05:45.937
He's late enough, Janice.
Come on.

05:45.978 --> 05:47.445
A hello to your niece,
maybe?

05:47.480 --> 05:49.812
Hi, sweetie.
How are you?

05:49.849 --> 05:51.817
Help him get ready,
will you?

05:51.851 --> 05:54.285
- Yeah.
- Come on, Jun'.

06:00.259 --> 06:01.886
So? How's he doing?

06:01.928 --> 06:04.089
He's Knucklehead Smith,
that's how he's doing.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.564
He's paranoid. He doesn't remember
whether he ate or not.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.624
The man is not
competent, Tony.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.398
- Not again, come on!
- He has the money for assisted living.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.302
He's got legal bills
up the ass.

06:13.339 --> 06:15.398
He can sell this museum
and move to Green Grove.

06:15.441 --> 06:18.308
Fuck assisted living, okay?
Remember what they did to Ma?

06:18.344 --> 06:22.144
- She was thriving there, Tony.
- He stays where he is, Janice.

06:22.181 --> 06:24.149
He's our uncle.
lt's the least we can do.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.208
So the split,
your friend in Jersey

06:26.252 --> 06:29.551
says it should be the same
as the old business we do over there.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.352
That's public works,
this isn't.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.258
- l'll hold the line.
- Don't turn it into World War lll.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.796
So day to day,
how are you getting along with Tony?

06:38.831 --> 06:41.356
You asked me
to bury the hatchet, John.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.835
l'm doing it
out of respect to you.

06:43.870 --> 06:46.270
Am l still grieving
over my brother Bill?

06:46.305 --> 06:48.239
lt'll never go away.

06:48.274 --> 06:50.367
l appreciate it, Phil.

06:52.278 --> 06:54.473
- With me in here--
- l hear you, John.

07:00.853 --> 07:04.152
Your bride--
she's a rock for you, kid.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.117
Her brother's fitting me
for contacts.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.958
When the trial starts,
l don't wanna be

07:09.996 --> 07:12.294
reading documents
in the courtroom with glasses.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.128
lt looks weak.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.896
Yes?

07:17.770 --> 07:20.068
- Hey, Ton'.
- Hey.

07:22.041 --> 07:24.373
My sports book
down in Roseville,

07:24.410 --> 07:26.640
Bacala's still making
things unpleasant.

07:26.679 --> 07:28.909
- God damn it.
- Listen, Tony,

07:28.948 --> 07:30.848
l got you something.

07:30.883 --> 07:34.148
For you, Carm, the kids--
David Yurman watches.

07:35.588 --> 07:38.421
18-karat gold,
diamond center.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.858
Why do l get the feelin'
there's a jeweler somewhere

07:40.893 --> 07:42.884
filin' an insurance
claim today?

07:42.929 --> 07:46.365
Actually,
that ain't what it is.

07:46.399 --> 07:48.367
- My Aunt Edie died.
- No?

07:48.401 --> 07:51.461
That one that moved to California
back in the '60s?

07:51.504 --> 07:53.802
She was a great lady,
the only person in my life

07:53.840 --> 07:55.398
who ever made me
feel special.

07:55.441 --> 07:57.341
What are you gonna do?

07:57.376 --> 08:01.005
Anyway, the silver cloud
is she did pretty well.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.016
She was married
to Victor Borge's agent.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.417
She left me an inheritance, Ton'.
Just over two mil.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.887
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.086
Well, congratulations.

08:15.127 --> 08:17.322
Make sure you invest it.

08:17.363 --> 08:20.389
Well, you know, that's kinda
what l wanted to talk to you about.

08:21.801 --> 08:23.325
Deanne and me
and the kids,

08:23.369 --> 08:25.303
you know how much
we love Florida, right?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.898
What, do you wanna put some money
on the street down there?

08:27.940 --> 08:31.569
l was thinking about buying
a place in Fort Myers.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.976
- Retiring there, actually.
- Retiring?

08:35.014 --> 08:37.482
What, are you
a hockey player?

08:37.517 --> 08:40.953
l'm gonna be 50 in three years, Ton'.
My dad died at 52.

08:40.986 --> 08:43.956
You took an oath, Gene.
There's no retirin' from this.

08:43.990 --> 08:47.721
Well, l thought about that,
and there was Joe Bananas.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.751
Come on, huh?

08:51.531 --> 08:54.329
What about your sports book,
your other responsibilities?

08:54.367 --> 08:55.925
What am l supposed
to do about those?

08:55.968 --> 08:59.062
Benny? We know
Bobby wants it.

08:59.105 --> 09:02.040
lt's just-- we go back
a long way, Ton'.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.673
Yeah, we do.

09:07.713 --> 09:11.672
Fuckin' CYO Basketball,
do you believe that?

09:11.717 --> 09:13.617
lt'd mean a lot
to me and Deanne.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.225
Well, let me
think about it.

09:27.199 --> 09:29.326
Ooh, look at this one
with the pool.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.427
Yeah, we could
go swimming.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.802
Guess who's blocking
the driveway again.

09:33.839 --> 09:35.534
Did you talk
to Tony?

09:35.575 --> 09:37.099
lt looks good.
He gave me a hug.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.543
- Did he like the watches?
- Do l know my psychology?

09:39.579 --> 09:41.809
The realtor called.
She's e-mailing some pictures.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.146
- The one on River Road?
- The split level-- the four-bedroom.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.709
They lost the buyer?

09:47.753 --> 09:51.211
Hey, there he is.
Where are you goin'?

09:51.257 --> 09:54.055
- Kevin's.
- Who else is gonna be there?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.220
- Gene.
- l don't know.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.459
What's with this hostility all the time?
You want a smack in the mouth?

09:59.498 --> 10:01.261
l told you l'm not
getting high anymore!

10:01.300 --> 10:02.995
- l believe you.
- Stop fucking touching me.

10:03.035 --> 10:04.866
Watch your mouth
in front of your sister!

10:04.904 --> 10:06.872
l have a right to know
who your friends are!

10:07.940 --> 10:09.498
Hey!

10:09.542 --> 10:11.373
Hey!

10:26.826 --> 10:29.386
Spicy shrimp hand roll,
that's Nori's favorite,

10:29.428 --> 10:32.295
special yellowtail,
toro scallion and oysters.

10:32.331 --> 10:34.299
You tell me
when you wanna stop.

10:34.333 --> 10:36.301
Well, keep it comin'.

10:36.335 --> 10:39.395
l don't know about you,
but ever since we found this place,

10:39.438 --> 10:41.736
l catch myself
fantasizing about this.

10:41.774 --> 10:44.572
Me too.
Sometimes during sex.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.441
So l had a nightmare the other night.
Did l wake you up?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.280
- No.
- Ade was in the house,

10:52.318 --> 10:54.479
my spec house.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.385
Was she gonna buy it?

10:56.422 --> 10:58.481
We were just talking.

10:58.524 --> 11:00.515
Speaking of which,
did you call that guy,

11:00.559 --> 11:02.823
the inspector
at the building department?

11:02.862 --> 11:05.228
- l will. l promise.
- He's coming on Friday, Tony.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.959
That could be
my last chance to get

11:06.999 --> 11:08.728
a reversal
on the stop-work order.

11:08.768 --> 11:11.259
All right, l'll call.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.771
l wonder where she is.

11:13.806 --> 11:16.297
- Ade.
- l told you, she probably met some guy.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.242
And not call anyone
for over a year?

11:18.277 --> 11:20.837
What's this,
this sauce on the shrimp?

11:20.880 --> 11:23.474
Shiromi, tekka maki,
salmon with tomato.

11:24.950 --> 11:26.747
So l was over
by Ginny's--

11:26.786 --> 11:28.754
that situation is
not going so well.

11:28.788 --> 11:30.779
Johnny cooped up
and awaiting trial,

11:30.823 --> 11:32.882
plus now they're fighting
an asset seizure.

11:32.925 --> 11:35.792
They could lose everything--
the house, the condo at the shore.

11:37.396 --> 11:40.194
You know Jimmy Petrille,
the rat that gave up John?

11:40.232 --> 11:43.668
He's like an uncle to him,
his father's compare.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.729
Why do you think l toss at night?
Ain't just the apnea.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.570
l noticed you haven't been taking
your antidepressants.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.940
And yet, the bonefish
are back in season.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.673
We should count our blessings,
the kind of year l just had.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.909
You're right.
We're very lucky.

11:56.949 --> 12:01.181
$40 for a piece of fish
they just flew in first class.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.950
l think we're
more than lucky.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.624
Great food in there.
lt's pretty good.

12:08.661 --> 12:10.390
You wanna keep
this baggie or shall l?

12:10.429 --> 12:12.090
- Nah, you keep it for lunch.
- Okay.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.655
We're here.

12:13.699 --> 12:15.360
Thanks for dinner, Hesh.

12:15.401 --> 12:17.460
Grease is coming through
the bag as usual.

12:17.503 --> 12:19.835
Chinese food--
it's part of the tradition.

12:22.208 --> 12:23.800
What the--

12:23.843 --> 12:25.811
Whoa! Whoa!

12:25.845 --> 12:27.676
What the fuck
is this?

12:29.882 --> 12:31.782
Come on, come on!
Hey, where are you goin'?

12:31.817 --> 12:33.307
Get outta the car!

12:33.352 --> 12:34.842
Get outta here,
get outta here!

12:34.887 --> 12:37.822
- Take a hike, Jimmy.
- Open up, Eli!

12:37.857 --> 12:39.347
- Get out!
- Open the fucking door!

12:39.391 --> 12:41.416
- Get outta here!
- What do you want me to do?

12:41.460 --> 12:44.361
- l can't do anything!
- Fucking Jew!

12:44.396 --> 12:46.660
- Let's go, old man!
- Open the fucking door!

12:46.699 --> 12:49.031
Holy shit, they're trying
to burn us out!

12:49.068 --> 12:51.161
- Open the fucking door!
- Get out, Hesh!

12:52.738 --> 12:56.538
- Leave me alone!
- Jerry warned you, Eli!

13:00.446 --> 13:03.711
Jerry fucking told you
to stay outta Brooklyn!

13:03.749 --> 13:06.240
What are you guys doin'?
You're gonna kill this guy.

13:08.921 --> 13:10.388
Fuck you, Grandpa!

13:15.628 --> 13:18.825
l tell you, one of the best things
about dropping the weight,

13:18.864 --> 13:20.991
a whole new wardrobe.
l keep this up,

13:21.033 --> 13:22.898
l'm gonna need
Clothing Anonymous.

13:22.935 --> 13:26.701
You should have called your sponsor
before you bought that jacket.

13:27.706 --> 13:29.537
Look at this guy.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.043
''Members Only''?
How long have you been wearing that?

13:32.077 --> 13:34.102
Cugino mio!

13:35.447 --> 13:37.142
You look sharp.
How do you feel?

13:37.183 --> 13:38.707
Two miles l walk
every mornin'.

13:38.751 --> 13:40.616
You goin' to little
Tommy's communion?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.985
l gotta talk to Aunt Lenore.
Say hello to Marie for me.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.887
Hold on, let me
get that number,

13:44.924 --> 13:46.585
- the custom cufflinks.
- Oh yeah.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.354
What'd that prick want?

13:48.394 --> 13:50.828
Really something, isn't he,
with that jerk-off face?

13:50.863 --> 13:53.764
The eyebrows--
l fucking can't stand him.

13:53.799 --> 13:57.098
l gotta tell you though,
he surprised me.

13:58.204 --> 13:59.569
He's acting boss,

13:59.605 --> 14:01.163
takes care
of John's business,

14:01.207 --> 14:03.539
plus the wife
while John's in jail.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.806
No complaints.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.642
He's real old school.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.511
Gotta take
my hat off.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.277
Cocksucker
wanted me killed?

14:11.317 --> 14:13.911
What's past is past.
Leave it alone.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.750
Things are
going good now.

14:17.323 --> 14:19.484
You and Phil settle
that office park shit?

14:19.525 --> 14:21.993
We said
we'd revisit it.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.018
Agent Harris,
where've you been?

14:24.063 --> 14:27.430
l got some new federale
in my rear view for six months.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.435
- Actually, l've been in Pakistan.
- Get the fuck out.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.460
Seriously.
l was transferred to terrorism.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.802
This is my partner, Ron Goddard.
Tony Soprano.

14:34.840 --> 14:36.808
The terrorist
squad, huh?

14:36.842 --> 14:39.436
- What, did you lose a little weight?
- Uh...

14:39.478 --> 14:41.309
You look good.
Atkins, right?

14:41.347 --> 14:44.248
l caught a parasite over there.
Doctors don't know what it is.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.649
- What do they eat, tabbouleh?
- Actually, that's why l'm here.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.916
l've been dying for a Satriale's
veal parm hero.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.962
Fuck him. l hope that parasite
eats his asshole out.

14:56.996 --> 14:59.760
l kinda feel bad
for the guy.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.130
Shit, when did
this happen?

15:02.167 --> 15:05.898
Hold on.
Ton' just come in.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.929
lt's Hesh.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.565
Yeah.

15:14.380 --> 15:16.848
Here, honey.
lt's ice.

15:19.685 --> 15:22.245
Tony.

15:22.288 --> 15:24.381
Thank you.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.120
Hey.

15:29.995 --> 15:31.622
Beth, how're you doin'?

15:31.664 --> 15:33.632
l've had
better weeks.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.634
Could you get me
some coffee, sweetie?

15:35.668 --> 15:39.798
- Anyone else?
- Hot water with lemon would be great.

15:44.743 --> 15:47.109
My son-in-law and me,
we're having dinner Sunday,

15:47.146 --> 15:50.343
Chinese restaurant near Mill Basin,
we get jumped by three guys in a Lexus.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.180
- Chinks did this?
- Are you trying to be fucking funny?

15:53.218 --> 15:55.516
- You want a smack in the mouth?
- What? l was serious.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.283
They're with your cousin
Phil Leotardo.

15:57.323 --> 15:58.756
l told you he was a prick!

15:58.791 --> 16:00.554
- We were just with him.
- Let him talk.

16:00.592 --> 16:02.560
l got some money
on the street over there.

16:02.594 --> 16:05.358
Apparently, it got back
to Phil's guy

16:05.397 --> 16:07.297
- Gerry Torciano.
- The Hairdo?

16:07.333 --> 16:09.767
He claims that he felt
that Eli here was

16:09.802 --> 16:12.794
some independent shy
trying to poach his customers.

16:12.838 --> 16:15.568
- ls that a fucking catheter?
- Massive internal bleeding,

16:15.607 --> 16:18.007
half his fucking skin
is sheared off his hips.

16:18.043 --> 16:19.943
My daughter's
besides herself.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.277
You send somebody to Brooklyn, and you
talk to Phil

16:22.314 --> 16:25.249
- about this mook, this--
- Gerry Torciano.

16:29.355 --> 16:31.084
Sorry l yelled
at you, kid.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.569
l'm installing gable joists
in the rotunda.

16:50.676 --> 16:53.736
l'm afraid l'm gonna have to agree
with the original assessment.

16:53.779 --> 16:55.872
Oh, for the love
of Mike!

16:55.914 --> 16:57.848
This is pine, sir--
utility grade.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.943
l know what it is.
l've been building houses for years.

17:00.986 --> 17:03.614
Then you know that the code calls
for Doug fir grade,

17:03.655 --> 17:07.318
stamped for all floor joists,
ceiling joists, lintels and rafters.

17:07.358 --> 17:10.055
Get Pudgie Walsh on the horn.
He'll straighten this out.

17:10.095 --> 17:12.893
Pudgie Walsh
retired, sir.

17:12.931 --> 17:16.059
- l'm affirming the stop-work order.
- Oh, come on!

17:16.101 --> 17:18.069
- ls there nothing else we can do?
- For God's sake!

17:18.103 --> 17:20.833
You can schedule a further appeal.
But if l were you,

17:20.873 --> 17:23.967
l'd think about starting over
with the proper lumber.

17:27.880 --> 17:31.145
God, 15 times
l asked you!

17:31.183 --> 17:33.151
Do you know what this does
to my cost basis,

17:33.185 --> 17:35.813
- to start over with this?
- lt's bureaucratic bullshit!

17:35.854 --> 17:38.846
- ln my day, they'd turn a blind eye.
- l hired you to do a job!

17:38.891 --> 17:40.859
Hired?
l'm not for hire.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.861
You presented this
like we were partners.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.920
- You don't listen to anybody, do you?
- Oh!

17:44.963 --> 17:48.421
To hell with this.
No good deed goes unpunished.

17:52.171 --> 17:54.571
Artie. Ho.

17:54.606 --> 17:56.836
Menus.

18:01.180 --> 18:04.343
- ls that Phil?
- My wife.

18:04.383 --> 18:08.046
What's it take to get that guy
to return a phone call?

18:08.087 --> 18:09.850
l want this Hesh thing
settled.

18:09.888 --> 18:12.379
Gentlemen,
start your engines.

18:12.424 --> 18:15.621
Jesus Christ, Artie,
l can recite that menu in my sleep.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.459
Where did he get this bread,
the bread museum?

18:21.500 --> 18:23.400
The antipaste?

18:23.435 --> 18:26.427
Fuckin' Phil.
Now l gotta go see the optometrist

18:26.472 --> 18:28.963
to get a message to John
about this.

18:29.007 --> 18:30.497
Go through
Ginny's brother?

18:30.542 --> 18:32.635
He's a stunad
of the first magnitude.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.647
l need a back channel
to John, obviously.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.413
What the fuck is it?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.420
l can't catch
a fucking break!

18:42.454 --> 18:44.422
This is Tony Soprano

18:44.456 --> 18:46.856
talking about
the Angelo Giacolone murder.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.860
The sound quality
is not good,

18:48.894 --> 18:51.158
but l can back it up
in court.

18:51.196 --> 18:53.164
He said--

19:13.752 --> 19:15.720
You all right, Ton'?

19:15.754 --> 19:18.552
Yeah.
That formaldehyde smell...

19:18.590 --> 19:20.888
l knew this guy once,
Vietnam vet.

19:20.926 --> 19:23.258
He drank formaldehyde
over there just to get high.

19:23.295 --> 19:25.160
lt's the alcohol.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.764
Does he have to be here,
your fucking AA sponsor?

19:28.800 --> 19:31.667
lt ain't just that he helps me
with the disease, T.

19:31.703 --> 19:33.728
This guy is great
at forging documents.

19:33.772 --> 19:36.240
- He was a good kid, Raymond.
- The best.

19:36.275 --> 19:39.767
At least he went fast.
Not like Dick Barone, poor fuck.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.211
- Dick Barone died?
- Lou Gehrig's disease.

19:42.247 --> 19:44.272
Did you ever think
what a coincidence it is

19:44.316 --> 19:48.047
that Lou Gehrig died
of Lou Gehrig's disease?

19:48.086 --> 19:50.577
You gonna make that same stupid joke
every time that comes up?

19:50.622 --> 19:52.590
Sorry.

19:52.624 --> 19:54.455
Everything's
so fucking morbid.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.018
There's a man
lying dead over there.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.053
l'm gonna go smoke.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.505
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

20:11.543 --> 20:13.511
l don't know
what l was thinking.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.445
For you.
Your taste.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.107
The inheritance.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.118
l didn't want
to say nothing,

20:20.152 --> 20:22.848
with your aunt and all,
but this is thoughtful.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.618
- So that thing we spoke about...
- Still mulling it.

20:25.657 --> 20:27.921
Yeah, whatever.
Sure.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.793
All right.
All right.

20:30.829 --> 20:34.026
Look at this guy.
Not a day over 76.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.296
- Fucking ballbreaker.
- How are you, Rusty?

20:37.936 --> 20:40.496
ls Phil Leotardo here?
'Cause l won't stay

20:40.539 --> 20:42.871
- in the same room with that man.
- l haven't seen him.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.206
So you hear about that guy
in Westchester?

20:45.244 --> 20:47.007
Fucking captain,

20:47.045 --> 20:49.445
doing his own radio broadcast
the last three years.

20:49.481 --> 20:52.348
- W.R.A.T.
- Jesus Christ, another one now?

20:52.384 --> 20:56.286
No wonder the papers are calling this
''The Year of the Rat.''

20:56.321 --> 20:59.813
Standup guys like that,
they're a dying breed.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.951
Amen to that.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.962
What can you do?

21:03.996 --> 21:06.965
Anyway, let me go
pay my respects.

21:06.999 --> 21:08.990
All right, Rusty.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.973
- You okay?
- l gotta get out of here.

21:23.015 --> 21:25.950
He's thinking about it.
What do you want me to tell you?

21:25.984 --> 21:29.317
How many years have we dreamt
about this, to get out of this shit?

21:29.354 --> 21:31.345
Every time someone
we know gets arrested--

21:31.390 --> 21:32.823
l know. Will you stop?

21:32.858 --> 21:35.986
l'm worried, Gene.
We've already made the offer.

21:36.028 --> 21:38.258
l'm doing
everything l can.

21:39.264 --> 21:41.494
Why are you fighting?

21:41.533 --> 21:43.797
We're not fighting, sweetie.
We're talking.

21:43.835 --> 21:46.360
- How come you're not in bed, hmm?
- l don't know.

21:46.405 --> 21:49.340
All l'm saying is,
he has to see

21:49.374 --> 21:51.365
this is a huge
opportunity for us.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.378
Give the man
time to process.

21:55.781 --> 21:58.306
Oh my God,
this eel is delicious.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.818
Okay, Spanish mackerel now.

22:00.852 --> 22:02.513
Can l get
another sake, hon'?

22:05.557 --> 22:09.516
Listen, l got some stuff
l gotta take care of.

22:09.561 --> 22:12.121
You okay
to drive yourself home?

22:12.164 --> 22:14.758
l don't have
my car, Tony.

22:14.800 --> 22:17.200
Oh, yeah.
So take this one.

22:17.235 --> 22:19.465
- Hey, Mrs. S.
- What is this?

22:19.504 --> 22:21.472
Oh my God.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.474
ls this the new Porsche?

22:25.510 --> 22:29.037
Cayenne Turbo.
l got the 4.5-liter V-8.

22:29.081 --> 22:31.208
Wasn't sure about the color,
so l took a shot.

22:31.249 --> 22:33.683
Tony, l love it.
lt's gorgeous!

22:33.719 --> 22:36.779
l still wish you'd talked to that guy
at the building department,

22:36.822 --> 22:39.154
but oh my God!
What a car!

22:55.140 --> 22:57.836
Ho, Joe College,
where's your mother?

22:57.876 --> 23:01.368
She went to the outlet stores
with Aunt Ro.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.608
ls that the jacket
we got you for Christmas?

23:03.648 --> 23:06.640
l'm lending it to Matt.

23:08.086 --> 23:11.647
Hey, how was the interview
for the internship?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.282
Got moved
to next week.

23:13.325 --> 23:15.190
Would you mind keeping me
in the loop, though, since it was

23:15.227 --> 23:17.957
- my lawyer that set it up, huh?
- Okay.

23:21.700 --> 23:24.669
- Matt don't have his own clothes?
- He's borrowing it for a party.

23:24.703 --> 23:27.365
Oh, good.
You'll never see it again.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.772
You have such a low
opinion of people.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.678
Let me tell you
something, AJ.

23:34.713 --> 23:36.681
l don't care
how close you are,

23:36.715 --> 23:38.910
in the end, your friends
are gonna let you down.

23:38.950 --> 23:41.510
Family. They're the only ones
you can depend on.

23:48.727 --> 23:52.322
He was vital, my uncle,
alive.

23:52.364 --> 23:55.333
For all his faults,
he was sharp in his day.

23:57.235 --> 23:59.795
But now...

24:03.208 --> 24:05.699
We stopped
at a light yesterday,

24:05.744 --> 24:08.178
and l see this nanny,

24:08.213 --> 24:10.579
black girl,
pushing a baby carriage.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.583
Coming the other way,

24:12.617 --> 24:14.778
there's another one

24:14.820 --> 24:17.050
with this old lady
in a wheelchair

24:17.088 --> 24:20.990
- staring off into space.
- The circle of life.

24:21.026 --> 24:25.019
The circle jerk of life.
Where's the dignity?

24:25.063 --> 24:29.090
lf you're lucky, in the end you can
let go of your pride,

24:29.134 --> 24:31.159
let your loved ones
care for you.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.330
l'd rather they hold
a pillow over my face.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.771
l find it interesting
you would say that.

24:37.242 --> 24:39.938
You tried to smother
your mother with a pillow.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.677
- What?
- ln the hospital, after her stroke.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.014
The fuck l did!

24:47.052 --> 24:49.782
l grabbed a pillow,
but it was...

24:49.821 --> 24:53.257
just to keep my hands
occupied.

24:53.291 --> 24:55.259
Have you considered

24:55.293 --> 24:57.727
getting your uncle
some live-in help?

24:57.762 --> 25:01.061
We got a girl comes in days,
she's from Trinidad.

25:01.099 --> 25:03.431
Does he have the means
for assisted living?

25:03.468 --> 25:06.869
Did you just say to let your loved ones
take care of you?

25:06.905 --> 25:09.669
- lf it's feasible.
- Well, he's my uncle.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.539
l don't think that's what
we're talking about.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.907
What are we
talking about?

25:12.944 --> 25:16.402
The fact that you still,
after all this time,

25:16.448 --> 25:19.042
cannot accept you had a mother
who didn't love you.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.450
ln pitying your uncle,

25:21.486 --> 25:23.920
the man she conspired with,

25:23.955 --> 25:26.617
you're turning the blame
for what she did

25:26.658 --> 25:30.719
back on yourself again,
after all this time.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.730
What was your mother like?

25:32.764 --> 25:35.232
Did she ever let you down,
hurt your feelings?

25:35.267 --> 25:37.633
Of course she did.
She was controlling

25:37.669 --> 25:39.967
and manipulative at times.

25:40.005 --> 25:43.634
- She also never tried to kill me.
- l pushed her over the edge.

25:43.675 --> 25:47.111
By placing her in a lovely
retirement community.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.669
lt's a nursing home!

25:48.713 --> 25:51.204
lt's less hurtful to believe
that they were right

25:51.249 --> 25:54.241
to try and destroy you
than to accept the fact

25:54.286 --> 25:57.414
that she didn't value you.

26:03.795 --> 26:06.127
Hesh is a personal
friend of mine,

26:06.164 --> 26:08.223
and the kid is
his son-in-law.

26:08.266 --> 26:11.099
Now l know Phil's got
a lot on his plate, but come on.

26:11.136 --> 26:14.003
l'll talk to John. l was taking
my sister there Saturday anyway.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.405
How is Ginny?
Carmela says she's got her hands full.

26:16.441 --> 26:19.103
The kid has the weight
of the world on her.

26:21.279 --> 26:24.578
Ray-Bans.
Classic, affordable.

26:24.616 --> 26:26.140
l just put those
on special.

26:26.184 --> 26:30.018
You got something
a little more current?

26:32.490 --> 26:34.481
Like those.

26:38.563 --> 26:41.726
Armanis.
Flexible acetate frames,

26:41.766 --> 26:44.496
rimless lenses.

26:46.805 --> 26:50.400
You know what?
l left my wallet in the car.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.433
l'll catch you next time.

27:03.521 --> 27:05.580
Some people
from the lRS came by.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.922
They want to inventory
the entire house.

27:10.895 --> 27:12.863
Maybe l should
sell the car,

27:12.897 --> 27:14.865
at least get some
liquidity out of it.

27:14.899 --> 27:16.696
The Maserati?

27:16.735 --> 27:19.329
Can't say l disagree.

27:19.371 --> 27:21.396
That breaks my
fucking heart.

27:21.439 --> 27:25.068
Christopher Moltisanti
came over to the house asking about it.

27:25.110 --> 27:28.238
He'll pay cash, he said.

27:29.280 --> 27:31.077
There's something else,
John,

27:31.116 --> 27:33.676
Phil related.

27:33.718 --> 27:36.016
The Hairdo, he's in a beef
with the Jew.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.682
What?
God damn it, what?

27:38.723 --> 27:40.691
The Jew's son-in-law.
lt got physical.

27:40.725 --> 27:44.183
Your friend from Jersey got involved,
but he can't get Phil to focus.

27:44.229 --> 27:46.527
Do l not have enough
on my fucking mind?

27:46.564 --> 27:48.532
The guy from Jersey
asked me to tell you.

27:48.566 --> 27:52.229
Well, then call Phil
and have him fucking handle it!

27:52.270 --> 27:56.366
Don't yell at my brother, John.
He's trying to do right by us.

28:02.681 --> 28:05.411
The pictures
from Allegra's shower.

28:28.106 --> 28:30.074
Noon he said, right?

28:30.108 --> 28:32.076
Passive-aggressive
bullshit.

28:32.110 --> 28:35.102
l recognize that in people
every time now.

28:35.146 --> 28:37.114
There he is.

28:37.148 --> 28:40.117
Ho, finally. l was starting to grow
mushrooms out my ass.

28:40.151 --> 28:42.051
There's an image.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.357
So Gerry filled me in
on the way over.

28:50.395 --> 28:53.159
This whole thing was
a complete misunderstanding.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.496
Yeah, this Eli kid, l had any idea
he was with you,

28:55.533 --> 28:58.001
- l would have never...
- He didn't tell you about Hesh?

28:58.036 --> 29:01.563
l asked who he was. He high-handed me.
l thought he was a civilian.

29:01.606 --> 29:03.369
Still, to get dragged
by a car?

29:03.408 --> 29:06.844
For the record, though,
the car thing was a hit-and-run.

29:07.979 --> 29:09.844
So what do we do here?

29:09.881 --> 29:11.974
- What did we say?
- 25 sounds right.

29:12.016 --> 29:15.110
He's bleeding internally.
Pain, suffering--

29:15.153 --> 29:17.815
So you tell me. 50?

29:17.856 --> 29:19.824
Yeah, fair enough.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.917
Could we segue now
into something more pressing?

29:21.960 --> 29:23.928
The floor is yours,
Senator.

29:23.962 --> 29:27.363
l spoke to John. The split on the office
park is way out of whack.

29:27.398 --> 29:29.263
Same thing
as the Esplanade.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.791
Apples and bowling balls, Tony.
With fuel costs now--

29:31.836 --> 29:34.464
Like you're not
passing that on to the drivers?

29:34.506 --> 29:36.701
65-35.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.338
All right.

29:47.886 --> 29:50.411
Why you always cave
for this prick?

29:50.455 --> 29:53.447
l'm not caving.
lt's a strategy.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.627
Johnny's in jail.
You keep him happy,

29:56.661 --> 29:59.255
he'll keep a lid
on Phil.

29:59.297 --> 30:03.324
Tony B,
Phil's kid brother,

30:03.368 --> 30:05.802
the bad taste
that left with Phil--

30:05.837 --> 30:08.863
there are 200 soldiers
in his family.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.875
l'm not scared of them.

30:10.942 --> 30:12.876
- Tony left?
- Yeah.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.277
l stopped by Stewart's.
l got a whole lunch set up.

30:27.792 --> 30:30.420
Did Tony mention anything to you
about what we talked about?

30:30.461 --> 30:32.429
About you
moving to Florida?

30:32.463 --> 30:35.057
Did he say if he's leaning
one way or the other?

30:39.003 --> 30:41.938
Listen, there's something
l need you to do.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.339
l got a call from Fritzie
up in Boston.

30:44.375 --> 30:47.742
There's a guy named
Teddy Spirodakis, owes some money.

30:47.779 --> 30:51.875
- You want me to collect?
- That ship sailed. Final notice time.

30:51.916 --> 30:53.543
Really?

30:53.585 --> 30:55.485
You got a problem
with that?

30:55.520 --> 30:57.488
No.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.082
l just gotta run it by Vito.
He's my captain.

31:00.124 --> 31:02.615
Believe me,
Vito will be down with it.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.719
So this comes from Tony?

31:04.762 --> 31:07.287
lt's coming from me.
l'm not a fucking captain?

31:07.332 --> 31:09.527
All right, okay?

31:10.635 --> 31:12.603
- How soon?
- ASAP.

31:12.637 --> 31:14.605
Like right away.

31:14.639 --> 31:16.766
l'll call with the details.
Get it done.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.709
l'll put in a good word to T
about the Florida thing.

31:39.964 --> 31:42.364
The rear deck, didn't they say
that would be refinished?

31:42.400 --> 31:45.665
That's the old photo.
lt's been completely redone.

31:45.703 --> 31:48.035
The wiring in the pool house?
Tell them they can knock

31:48.072 --> 31:50.472
two grand off the price
or they can sell to someone else.

31:50.508 --> 31:52.669
Listen, you're responding
to their counter.

31:52.710 --> 31:54.575
You should ask
for whatever you want.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.580
Okay, we'll call you
tomorrow.

31:56.614 --> 31:58.582
All right then,
good night.

31:58.616 --> 32:00.982
What do you think?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.715
That if we lose this house,
l'm gonna die.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.727
Ton', what do you want
to do for dinner?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.756
l'll be right down!

32:48.166 --> 32:49.599
Well...

32:51.302 --> 32:53.270
Hey.

32:53.304 --> 32:55.704
Your new insurance card.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.970
Oh, good.

33:00.912 --> 33:03.676
Any thoughts
on dinner?

33:03.715 --> 33:05.706
Whatever you like.

33:07.285 --> 33:09.253
l know this is insane,

33:09.287 --> 33:11.517
but l can't stop
thinking about Nori's.

33:11.556 --> 33:12.921
l was just there.

33:12.957 --> 33:15.687
- Today? With who?
- Nobody.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.287
You went there
without me?

33:18.329 --> 33:21.492
Yeah, l was hungry.

33:21.532 --> 33:23.693
- What?
- Nothing.

33:23.735 --> 33:25.703
- Come on, what?
- l don't know,

33:25.737 --> 33:28.103
l just thought
that was our special place.

33:28.139 --> 33:29.868
Well, it is.

33:29.907 --> 33:31.534
Well?

33:31.576 --> 33:33.942
- l went there alone, Carm.
- l know that. You said.

33:33.978 --> 33:38.278
lt just felt nice
to have something special, for us.

33:38.316 --> 33:41.183
No kids around,
without my parents...

33:42.286 --> 33:44.254
We can go
if you want.

33:44.288 --> 33:46.483
No no,
don't be silly.

33:46.524 --> 33:48.515
Are you sure?

33:56.234 --> 33:58.225
How's the car?

34:20.858 --> 34:22.826
Teddy, right?

34:22.860 --> 34:25.795
Yeah.
Hey!

35:02.700 --> 35:04.998
- Carmela.
- Ginny, hi.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.368
l tried calling,
but l kept getting the machine.

35:07.405 --> 35:09.498
ls everything all right?
Truth is,

35:09.540 --> 35:12.100
sometimes l don't answer the phone.
Goddamn creditors.

35:12.143 --> 35:15.340
l was in the neighborhood. l thought
l might kidnap you for a spa date.

35:15.379 --> 35:17.279
Well, that's
a nice surprise.

35:17.315 --> 35:20.182
l thought maybe we'd drive up there,
maybe stop at Occitane.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.186
ls that new?

35:22.220 --> 35:24.188
Oh, the car?
Yes yes.

35:24.222 --> 35:25.985
Porsche Cayenne,
like the pepper.

35:26.023 --> 35:28.389
lt's beautiful, Carm.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.951
Five minutes

35:30.995 --> 35:34.362
at no incline. Then l switch to full
uphill for my cardio.

35:34.398 --> 35:36.832
l was telling Tony
he should come with me.

35:36.868 --> 35:40.497
- Do him good.
- lt ain't just aesthetics, either.

35:40.538 --> 35:42.938
God forbid he ever has
a heart attack.

35:44.008 --> 35:45.942
Yeah.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.502
Vito, you're in
the handicapped spot.

35:48.546 --> 35:52.004
- That fucking guy is here again?
- The man's a former judge.

35:55.253 --> 35:57.346
Hey, listen to this.

35:57.388 --> 36:00.357
''lf your nose runs
and your feet smell--

36:00.391 --> 36:02.086
you're built
upside down.''

36:02.126 --> 36:04.287
Funny.

36:06.664 --> 36:08.962
Hey, by the way,
your Florida thing...

36:10.568 --> 36:12.798
Tony asked me
to speak to you...

36:14.272 --> 36:15.864
that's a no-go.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.932
- What?
- Can't be accommodated.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.875
You're part of the team.

36:19.911 --> 36:23.745
- But l just did that thing.
- That's not my department.

36:25.683 --> 36:29.278
Well, can l talk
to Tony at least?

36:29.320 --> 36:31.288
l wouldn't bother him.

36:31.322 --> 36:34.018
He's out on the new boat.

36:36.127 --> 36:38.755
Does he think
l'm gonna talk about shit up here,

36:38.796 --> 36:41.458
with what l've done,
what l just did?

36:56.380 --> 36:58.848
lt's not so silly
when you think about it.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.950
l'm a top earner now.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.955
lt's not out of the realm
of possibility

37:04.989 --> 37:07.890
that l could be the boss
of this family one day.

37:09.660 --> 37:12.185
l mean, God forbid
Tony ever gets...

37:12.230 --> 37:16.599
cancer, coronary,
something like that.

37:27.778 --> 37:30.372
- Yeah.
- Hey, big brother.

37:30.414 --> 37:33.349
Listen, l know l was supposed to sit
with Uncle Jun' tonight,

37:33.384 --> 37:35.648
but Tom just called
from location.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.621
Apparently,
some smoke effect went awry

37:38.656 --> 37:40.624
and he inhaled
noxious chemicals.

37:40.658 --> 37:42.023
Well, go go.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.894
The thing is,
Uncle Jun' doesn't want me to.

37:46.931 --> 37:50.025
He's exceptionally agitated
today and he's been nauseous.

37:51.602 --> 37:54.696
Well, did you call Janice?
l mean, her or Bobby should go.

37:54.739 --> 37:57.207
- l'm all the way out here on a boat.
- They can't do it.

37:57.241 --> 37:59.072
- What do you mean can't?
- l don't know.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.840
She didn't elaborate.
lt didn't seem like she wanted to.

38:01.879 --> 38:04.905
- Aw, God damn it!
- l'm sorry, Tony.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.917
All right, all right,
all right.

38:17.395 --> 38:20.262
Mother--

38:32.677 --> 38:36.670
l swear to God, l'm throwing
all this shit right in the garbage!

38:36.714 --> 38:39.205
lt's my hobby, Janice.
Why do you gotta belittle it?

38:39.250 --> 38:41.912
Will you just
get ready please?

38:41.952 --> 38:45.080
- You go. l gotta work.
- You can do your collections tomorrow!

38:45.122 --> 38:48.717
l'm on a schedule!
lt don't work that way.

38:48.759 --> 38:50.727
This is why you can't
watch Uncle Jun'?

38:50.761 --> 38:53.025
l told you last week,
we have Nica's preschool meeting.

38:53.064 --> 38:55.396
- She's 15 months old.
- No one was more competitive

38:55.433 --> 38:57.526
than your wife when
it came to this stuff with AJ.

38:57.568 --> 38:59.536
A lot of good it did.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.765
This child-- constantly wanting
the breast.

39:01.806 --> 39:04.775
He doesn't want to be alone.
He says he doesn't feel good.

39:04.809 --> 39:08.506
The school, they need to meet both
parents if it's an intact family.

39:08.546 --> 39:10.411
So call the girl,
the nurse.

39:10.448 --> 39:13.906
Miss Trinidad? Right. Every time
l call, a different person answers.

39:13.951 --> 39:16.078
l'll go, Ton'.
l'm on it.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.089
Fuck it! You wanna get something done,
you gotta do it yourself.

39:19.123 --> 39:21.853
You were the one
who was opposed to assisted living.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.693
You and l
are gonna talk.

39:32.670 --> 39:34.865
You didn't have
to wear your fucking hat.

39:34.905 --> 39:36.463
Shit.

39:36.507 --> 39:39.943
So how about you?
Are you dating?

39:39.977 --> 39:41.638
With my hours
at the body shop?

39:41.679 --> 39:44.842
Ladies.
Dessert was on me.

39:44.882 --> 39:46.406
Thank you, Artie.

39:46.450 --> 39:48.850
lt's nice to see you two
patch things up.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.878
- So silly.
- l'm not even sure what happened.

39:51.922 --> 39:53.890
Me and Tony didn't speak
for months.

39:53.924 --> 39:55.619
You pick up
right where you left off.

39:55.659 --> 39:58.594
Did Charmaine tell you?
We're getting back together.

39:58.629 --> 40:00.756
No, she didn't
mention it.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.733
- That's terrific!
- We're both very happy.

40:05.803 --> 40:08.294
Jesus, will you
hear me out at least?

40:08.339 --> 40:11.638
We buy here. Livingston,
North Caldwell maybe.

40:11.675 --> 40:13.643
- Right near Tony.
- Oh.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.702
Better schools,
new friends.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.374
We got the money, baby.
$2 million.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.907
lt's not
the same, Gene.

40:20.951 --> 40:23.181
lt could be better.

40:23.220 --> 40:25.950
The summers down there--
we were ignoring the negatives.

40:25.990 --> 40:29.050
lt's fucking brutal
with the bugs.

40:29.093 --> 40:33.427
Tony and Silvio,
all they understand is appearances.

40:33.464 --> 40:36.695
We'll buy a new car.
lt'll raise my profile.

40:36.734 --> 40:39.430
You watch,
l'll make captain.

40:51.582 --> 40:54.847
l found this
under our son's bed.

41:06.864 --> 41:10.527
Florida's any better?
lt's the drug capital of the world.

41:10.568 --> 41:12.468
Look, for Tony to--

41:12.503 --> 41:14.528
Tony, Tony!
Why don't you kill him?

41:14.572 --> 41:16.972
- Put a bullet in his fucking head.
- l can't do that.

41:17.007 --> 41:20.238
What, you think l don't know
that you've done it before?

41:21.412 --> 41:23.812
- He's the boss, Deanne.
- The boss of what?

41:23.848 --> 41:26.408
He's a piece of shit!

41:27.685 --> 41:29.812
ls our life that bad?

41:29.854 --> 41:32.846
lt's your money.
Your aunt's money.

41:32.890 --> 41:35.859
lt has nothing
to do with him.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.623
There's this wonderful
Jersey contemporary

41:40.664 --> 41:44.327
l want you to see with me.
lt's cathedral ceilings.

41:44.368 --> 41:47.098
You'll fall in love.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.202
There's nothing
l can say.

41:59.216 --> 42:03.619
Colonel Dax, you're
a disappointment to me.

42:03.654 --> 42:06.748
You have spoiled
the keenness of your mind

42:06.790 --> 42:08.758
by wallowing
in sentimentality.

42:08.792 --> 42:11.124
You really did want
to save those men

42:11.161 --> 42:13.425
and you were not angling
for Mireau's command.

42:13.464 --> 42:15.432
You're an idealist

42:15.466 --> 42:17.491
and l pity you as l would
the village idiot.

42:17.535 --> 42:20.163
We're fighting a war, Dax,
a war that we've got to win.

42:20.204 --> 42:22.263
Those men didn't fight,
so they were shot.

42:22.306 --> 42:25.673
l apologize for not being
entirely honest with you.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.007
l apologize for not revealing
my true feelings.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.172
l apologize, sir,
for not telling you--

42:30.214 --> 42:32.307
- Hello.
- Who's that?

42:32.349 --> 42:34.249
- lt's me.
- You can go to hell

42:34.285 --> 42:36.617
before l apologize to you
now or ever again!

42:36.654 --> 42:38.679
- What are you doing?
- l lost my uppers.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.986
- Probably upstairs.
- God fuck it all!

42:41.025 --> 42:43.118
Relax, will ya?
We'll find them.

42:43.160 --> 42:47.358
The phone keeps ringing,
and then they hang up.

42:47.398 --> 42:49.491
lt's probably salespeople.

42:49.533 --> 42:52.832
- l know who it is!
- Pussy Malanga, l know.

42:52.870 --> 42:55.964
We'll get J. Edgar Hoover
right on it.

42:56.006 --> 42:59.032
l'll tell you what, you go upstairs,
you look for your teeth.

42:59.076 --> 43:02.637
l'm gonna fix you
something to eat, okay?

43:04.949 --> 43:07.543
l had a banana
in there.

43:09.453 --> 43:12.115
All right,
we'll find that too.

43:16.093 --> 43:18.721
l got it.

43:18.762 --> 43:21.731
We buy a vacation place
in Florida, a condo.

43:21.765 --> 43:23.392
lt's not the same.

43:23.434 --> 43:25.402
l make another run
at Tony

43:25.436 --> 43:27.563
- six months, a year from now.
- A year?

43:27.605 --> 43:30.073
- You can go ahead even.
- What?

43:30.107 --> 43:32.769
And let me tell you,
a year, two years from now

43:32.810 --> 43:34.539
everything could be
different.

43:34.578 --> 43:37.570
Tony could be gone.

43:41.652 --> 43:45.019
- l, uh...
- Go ahead.

43:45.055 --> 43:47.114
His master's voice.

43:59.003 --> 44:00.994
Yeah?

44:02.873 --> 44:05.137
Now?!

44:30.734 --> 44:33.669
- Gene, this is Agent Sanseverino.
- Hello.

44:33.704 --> 44:36.264
Where've you been, buddy?
Haven't heard from you lately.

44:36.306 --> 44:39.742
Busy, you know.
My kid has some problems.

44:39.777 --> 44:41.745
That's rough.

44:41.779 --> 44:44.179
The thing is, Geno,
you gotta keep in touch with me.

44:44.214 --> 44:46.341
You have a chance to help
in more important ways.

44:46.383 --> 44:49.750
- What do you mean?
- We lost a major asset this month.

44:49.787 --> 44:52.347
- The point is--
- Was Ray Curto a cooperator?

44:52.389 --> 44:55.756
The way things are shaping up,
you're a designated hitter.

44:55.793 --> 44:58.489
Look, Ron,

44:58.529 --> 45:00.497
we've talked
about Florida, okay?

45:00.531 --> 45:02.590
Gene, that's not
gonna happen.

45:02.633 --> 45:04.897
Here among your friends
is where you're useful.

45:04.935 --> 45:07.802
l told you, you tell your bosses,
l'd come back for any trial.

45:07.838 --> 45:10.830
Florida's just one of those things
you gotta let go.

45:21.351 --> 45:23.319
Okay.

45:23.353 --> 45:27.016
So, the Feast of St. Joe's,
Tony gave some rulings on the unions.

45:27.057 --> 45:29.855
Were any made guys
from New York there?

47:15.632 --> 47:17.600
10 minutes, Uncle Jun'.

47:17.634 --> 47:19.795
Who's down there?

47:19.837 --> 47:22.101
Artie Shaw.
10 minutes.

47:22.139 --> 47:24.107
Don't go anywhere.

47:24.141 --> 47:26.109
l'm not.
l'm right here.

47:36.553 --> 47:38.748
You got any wine?

47:38.789 --> 47:40.950
Malanga!

49:02.873 --> 49:04.636
Well, here l am.

49:04.675 --> 49:06.370
ls that a Porsche?

49:06.410 --> 49:08.537
Had my eye on it for months.
lt's a gift from Tony.

49:08.578 --> 49:10.910
l thought about a Boxster,
but l don't know.

49:10.948 --> 49:12.848
The 'Vette felt
more like me.

49:14.384 --> 49:15.578
You bought that
yourself?

49:15.619 --> 49:18.588
The accountant says l'm better off
owning it outright.

49:30.600 --> 49:32.932
Uncle Jun'!

49:32.970 --> 49:35.438
Call 911!

49:35.472 --> 49:37.463
Uncle Jun'!

49:49.086 --> 49:51.077
Uncle Jun'!

50:23.086 --> 50:25.816
911, where is
the emergency?

50:25.856 --> 50:29.986
911, where is
the emergency?

51:32.022 --> 51:37.255
Number six is Khaibit:
the Shadow, Memory,

51:37.294 --> 51:42.129
your whole past conditioning from this and
other lives.

52:02.219 --> 52:06.883
Number seven is Sekhu:
the Remains.
