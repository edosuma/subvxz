00:03.754 --> 00:04.839
Mr. Bingham?

00:04.964 --> 00:07.090
Yes, I am Jeff Bingham.

00:07.215 --> 00:08.175
Just filled out
this form here.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.135
(GROANS)

00:13.263 --> 00:15.432
Sorry. I'm having a baby.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.352
Congratulations.
And your wife is doing fine.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.269
Well, she's not my wife.
She's a lesbian.

00:21.271 --> 00:22.898
I don't know
if that affects anything,

00:23.022 --> 00:24.441
but I wrote it
on the form there.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.819
Oh.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.779
Yes, I see.
"Big ol' lesbian."

00:29.989 --> 00:31.615
My wife is on her way.

00:31.740 --> 00:33.868
Now, will the two of you
be in the delivery room?

00:33.993 --> 00:36.411
Well, according to her,
we will be.

00:36.537 --> 00:37.412
But to be honest,
I really don't wanna
see my buddy's business.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.876
I'll get started
on your paperwork.
Okay.

00:42.001 --> 00:43.711
Jeff, I'm here. Sorry.
Ahh.

00:44.795 --> 00:45.921
Ah.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.756
Ah, me too. Me too, buddy.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.636
Okay. Hey, guys.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.596
Look, and as far as
this may or may not

00:54.722 --> 00:57.265
affect our wedding tonight,
it is all good.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.142
All right, the important
thing is not to worry.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.268
What's he talking about?

01:01.854 --> 01:04.023
Ha! That is a good one,
best man.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.650
And look,
if you'd like me to,

01:06.775 --> 01:08.276
I could be there
in the delivery room to help,

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
'cause as you know,
my mother was a doula.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.616
Well, I don't know
what that is,

01:14.742 --> 01:17.036
but don't take that as
an invitation to tell me.

01:19.872 --> 01:22.875
Well, a doula
is a nonmedical
birthing guide.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.836
Listen, maybe you can
go to the cafeteria and
get us some snacks.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.046
You're kinda under-using me,
but okay.

01:28.630 --> 01:31.132
Oh, hey,
speaking of snacks...

01:31.258 --> 01:32.467
Do you guys plan on
eating the placenta?

01:32.593 --> 01:33.594
(SIGHS)

01:34.887 --> 01:36.221
Uh...
No?

01:36.346 --> 01:37.765
No, Mm-mmm.
Just go.

01:37.890 --> 01:39.558
Okay. Placenta.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.395
Okay. When do we go
to the delivery room?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.272
All right. Well,
actually, I was thinking,

01:45.397 --> 01:46.774
with today's technology,
we could probably...

01:46.899 --> 01:49.359
No. You cannot
Skype the birth.

01:49.484 --> 01:51.528
Honey, I know
you're squeamish,

01:51.653 --> 01:53.154
but I want you in there
with me, come on.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.282
Yeah, well, forgive
me for not wanting
to see Brenda

01:55.407 --> 01:56.742
nearly torn in two
by another human.

01:58.410 --> 01:59.745
Honey, I will be
there to help you.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.455
Come on, it's gonna
be beautiful.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.791
Wow. You gals all stick
together, don't you?

02:08.879 --> 02:11.131
♪ How many ways
to say I love you?

02:14.134 --> 02:18.513

02:18.639 --> 02:23.393

02:44.623 --> 02:46.416
Ah, hello, Mr. Charles.
How goes the conference?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.794
(CHUCKLES)

02:48.919 --> 02:50.796
Oh, very witty, sir.

02:50.921 --> 02:52.756
So nice to work for someone
whose sense of humor

02:52.881 --> 02:54.883
transcends that
of a horny schoolboy.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.596
What's that?

02:59.721 --> 03:03.266
Human resources said there's
a problem with my work visa?

03:03.391 --> 03:05.978
Sir, I assure you,
it should've transferred
from my old job.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.147
I completed all the
required paperwork.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.690
All that was needed
was for Mr. Dunbar to...

03:09.815 --> 03:10.941
Oh, my God!

03:17.322 --> 03:19.700
EDDIE: Wait. Wait, you
can't just go in there!

03:21.952 --> 03:24.454
Sorry, sorry.
Sir, I tried to stop him.

03:24.579 --> 03:26.165
And you couldn't?
That doesn't have brakes?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.793
Just go get me
a cup of coffee or something.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.007
Well, well.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.343
To what do I owe
this inconvenience?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.387
Shouldn't be at your new job,
trying to curry favor
with your boss?

03:42.347 --> 03:44.099
And by curry,
I mean Indian curry.

03:46.309 --> 03:50.814
I'm here, braving your acrid
cologne one final time,

03:50.939 --> 03:52.232
to ask if you've
received a call

03:52.357 --> 03:53.358
from immigration officials
asking about me.

03:53.775 --> 03:54.693
No.

03:56.945 --> 04:00.032
I did get a prank phone call
about some fake name though.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.785
Timir Patel?
Yes!

04:03.911 --> 04:05.037
Did you get
that same call?

04:06.371 --> 04:08.498
That's my given name.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.167
Oh, really?
You should give it back.

04:11.626 --> 04:14.504
Sir, that was
a verification call

04:14.629 --> 04:17.132
to extend my visa
to stay in America.

04:17.257 --> 04:19.760
Tell 'em to call me back.
I'll "strizzy" it all "izzy."

04:19.885 --> 04:22.221
Oh, I think you've
"strizzled" enough "izzle."

04:24.556 --> 04:25.891
What do you need?

04:27.226 --> 04:28.476
I have your coffee.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.896
I'm in a meeting.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.231
You can't barge in...
Just put it on the floor.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.235
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
Okay.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.612
Oh, and Adam Rhodes
called from the hospital.

04:38.737 --> 04:41.156
He said Brenda's
gone into labor.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.867
Just another prank phone call.
I don't know a Brenda.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.078
Brenda.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.621
(SIGHS)
Seriously?

04:47.746 --> 04:49.539
Mr. and Mrs. Bingham's friend

04:49.664 --> 04:50.874
and surrogate
for their child...

04:52.459 --> 04:54.836
Who you've met umpteen times!

04:55.462 --> 04:56.421
Brenda!

05:04.471 --> 05:05.806
Oh, Bren-da.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.601
I know Brenda.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:09.726 --> 05:11.352
No, she's having a kid.
We should go see it.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.562
And more importantly,
hot nurses.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.314
I'd love to.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.108
Unfortunately, I have to go
to the immigration office.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.735
Why?

05:18.860 --> 05:22.239
I'm kidding.
All that stuff you were
blabbing out, I heard ya.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.574
Listen, why don't you
cruise by after you
straighten all that out, okay?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.410
Aah.

05:30.371 --> 05:32.624
Really, Eddie?
You put coffee
on the floor?

05:39.047 --> 05:41.633
All right, Brenda,
keep breathing.
You're doing great.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.010
Ahh, Doctor says
you're doing great.
Yes, I can hear.

05:43.135 --> 05:44.928
The baby is not coming
out of my ears.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.596
Hey, Jeff.
Don't look down there, okay?

05:46.721 --> 05:48.182
Don't worry.
I don't want to.

05:48.307 --> 05:49.850
Jeff! Can you please
try to be helpful?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.269
All right. I will, okay?

05:52.393 --> 05:53.979
Mets lost again.
No surprise there.
(GRUNTING)

05:54.104 --> 05:56.148
What are you doing?

05:56.273 --> 05:58.399
I'm reading the sports
page to take Brenda's
mind off of the pain.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.068
That's not gonna help.
No, actually I think that
it will. Keep going, Jeff.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.320
As I was saying...

06:01.444 --> 06:02.529
Mets three games in a row.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.156
(GROANS LOUDLY)

06:04.281 --> 06:05.406
Yeah, it's been
a rough season.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.492
(GRUNTS)

06:07.617 --> 06:10.162
Andres Torres, one for four.
Justin Turner, one for four.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.040
All right, this is not
exactly how I pictured
the birth of my child.

06:13.165 --> 06:14.791
Yeah, well...
Who pitched for the Mets?

06:14.916 --> 06:16.459
Santana.
Ugh.

06:16.584 --> 06:17.502
They just never
score runs for him.

06:18.461 --> 06:20.297
Please, what is happening?

06:20.421 --> 06:22.632
I blame the middle of
the Mets' batting order.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.925
No, I meant with Brenda.
What...

06:24.718 --> 06:26.636
Oh, of course.

06:26.761 --> 06:29.056
Oh, looks like
the baby's coming
down the birth canal.

06:29.181 --> 06:31.183
Ooh. David Wright, 0 for 4.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.018
Ow, ow!

06:33.143 --> 06:35.062
DOCTOR: Keep breathing.
That's a girl.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.855
You two wanna come see
the progress down here?

06:36.980 --> 06:38.273
Oh, come on, doc!

06:39.774 --> 06:41.568
Jeff, this is the birth
of our daughter.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.611
If you miss this,
you're gonna be sorry.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.072
Yeah, go ahead, Jeff.
Everyone else
is looking at it.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.532
Come on, I'll help you.
I'll hold your hand.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.705
(VOMITS)

06:53.830 --> 06:55.456
What just happened?

06:55.582 --> 06:57.209
Audrey looked at your stuff
and threw up.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.339
Oh, hey.

07:02.463 --> 07:04.632
Hey, Russell.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.551
Jeff and Audrey,
having a baby, huh?

07:06.676 --> 07:09.012
Pretty exciting.
I know.
It's a real hoot, buddy.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.513
Plus it gets me
out of some lame

07:10.638 --> 07:12.057
bummer of a thing
I had to do later tonight.

07:14.809 --> 07:16.311
My wedding to Jen?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.855
Oh, that was it, yeah.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.732
Whew, bullet dodged.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.778
Hey, don't worry, buddy.
We're gonna reschedule it.

07:24.903 --> 07:27.447
Hey, to be honest,
it gives me more
time to train Mambo.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.824
Mm-mmm.
You know, I want him to,
like, fly the rings in.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.368
Right.

07:31.492 --> 07:32.535
We are just not there yet.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.330
Really? Tell me less.

07:35.455 --> 07:36.581
Hey, listen...

07:37.999 --> 07:40.752
Where's all the, uh,
nurses around here?

07:40.877 --> 07:43.255
Uh, there's a couple of
'em right over there.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.883
No. No, no.

07:47.008 --> 07:48.969
No, you're not hearing me.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.221
The nurses with the,
uh, fishnets and the
short skirts and the...

07:54.182 --> 07:56.393
Oh, yeah, the porno nurses.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.852
Yes, those.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.396
(ELEVATOR DINGS)

08:01.189 --> 08:02.732

It's the wife.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.985
Hi, baby.

08:05.110 --> 08:08.280
Jen, it's good you're here.
Maybe you can help.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.824
Do you know where I can
find the porno nurses?

08:13.701 --> 08:16.537
Yes, on the browsing history
of every computer
you've ever touched.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.540
(CHUCKLES) Not untrue.

08:19.666 --> 08:21.209
But if there's any
on this floor,
I'll find 'em stat.

08:25.046 --> 08:27.299
It's pretty exciting, huh?

08:27.424 --> 08:30.010
Hey, maybe Jeff and Audrey
will put us down on
who gets the baby if they die.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.303
I mean...

08:31.428 --> 08:32.220
Maybe.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.640
What's wrong, huh?

08:35.765 --> 08:38.477
Oh. Honey, are you...

08:38.601 --> 08:40.187
Are you sad that
Jeff and Audrey are dead?

08:42.647 --> 08:45.108
No. I'm upset
because, once again,

08:45.233 --> 08:46.693
something happens on the day
we're supposed to get married.

08:46.818 --> 08:48.445
No, we can still do it.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.072
No, it wouldn't be the same
without Jeff and Audrey.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.950
And besides, they're supposed
to be our best man
and our maid of honor.

08:54.075 --> 08:57.204
Okay, so we'll reschedule it.

08:57.329 --> 08:58.163
I mean, this whole thing
is super casual.
It won't be hard.

08:59.956 --> 09:03.210
Plus, plus Mambo
is almost to the point...

09:03.335 --> 09:05.212
Enough with the bird!

09:05.337 --> 09:07.964
Okay. But when
we do get married,

09:08.089 --> 09:09.590
hmm-hmm,
he will stick the landing.

09:11.343 --> 09:12.719
I don't know.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.929
I mean, maybe this
is the universe's way

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
of telling us we're just
not meant to get married.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.599
Are...
Are you dumping me?

09:19.976 --> 09:21.436
What?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.062
Honey, no, because I,
I can change.

09:22.187 --> 09:23.897
I mean...

09:24.022 --> 09:25.190
I can make more money.
I could get smarter.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.364
No. I'm just saying,
maybe we should just
keep living together.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.823
(ELEVATOR DINGS)
You know, maybe getting
married wasn't meant to be.

09:33.948 --> 09:34.782
(SIGHS)

09:40.621 --> 09:41.540
Or maybe it was.

09:49.506 --> 09:51.091
Come on, Brenda!
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

09:51.216 --> 09:53.260
Come on! It's a good
deal for both of us.

Jeff, I am not making
a fantasy baseball
trade right now!

09:56.721 --> 09:58.515
Okay.
All right, I'm back.

09:58.639 --> 10:00.267
I've just been
a little nauseous lately,

10:00.392 --> 10:01.809
but I swear I did not throw up
because I saw your vagina.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
Aah!
Whoa!

10:03.228 --> 10:04.479
You gotta use the "V" word.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.647
It's a medical term.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.817
I prefer to use "hoo ha."
Little more fun. Try it.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.819
Hoo ha.
Yeah, that's better.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.239
Oh, my God.
Come on, guys, focus.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.740
DOCTOR: All right.
Okay, Brenda.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.658
Now one more big push.

10:17.784 --> 10:19.202
Oh, God.
Ah, okay.
It's happening.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.954
(GRUNTING)

10:21.079 --> 10:21.829
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's happening?
What's happening?

10:21.955 --> 10:23.790
Your baby, she's crowning.

10:23.915 --> 10:25.833
Ahh! Ahh!
Jeff, did you hear that?

10:25.959 --> 10:28.044
Yeah, already wearing
a crown, just like
her mom, Queen Audrey.

10:28.169 --> 10:29.712
(GROANS)

10:29.837 --> 10:31.631
I have never been
in so much pain,

10:31.756 --> 10:33.550
but at least
I'm not married to you.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.760
(BREATHES HEAVILY)

10:40.848 --> 10:41.641
Hello, your excellence.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.439
I'm Adam, and this
is my fiancee Jennifer.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.190
I'm Reverend Todd.
Pleased to meet you.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.775
Are you family?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.360
No. We're just browsing.

10:53.528 --> 10:55.405
So, uh, you busy?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.493
Well, I'm here to
tend to this man's
spiritual needs.

10:59.618 --> 11:00.619
Oh.

11:01.495 --> 11:02.745
Yeah, wow. He is old.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.041
He looks like a turtle
that just crawled
out of his shell.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.628
Adam!
No, no. He's right.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.381
But he has lived a
very long, very full life.

11:13.507 --> 11:14.215
Yes.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.552
Come on, Adam.
Just ask him.
Okay.

11:17.676 --> 11:18.845
(DEEP BREATH)

11:18.970 --> 11:21.473
Well, the thing is,
uh, you know,

11:21.598 --> 11:24.142
Jen and I here
have been engaged
for, like, ever.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.019
All right.
Fast-forward to right now.

11:26.144 --> 11:27.479
Can I be me, please?
Can I just be me?

11:31.149 --> 11:33.234
I'm sorry. Uh, anyway,
we were wondering

11:33.360 --> 11:35.862
if maybe you could marry
us in the hospital chapel.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.738
I would be happy to.

11:37.864 --> 11:38.990
Wow. That's great!
You know, thank you so much!

11:39.115 --> 11:41.409
Look, see, Jen,
it was meant to be.

11:41.535 --> 11:44.412
Unfortunately, I need
to be here at his bedside
until he passes.

11:45.580 --> 11:48.041
Oh.

11:48.166 --> 11:50.502
We... We understand.
And we appreciate you
even consid...

11:50.627 --> 11:52.337
(ECG FLATLINING)
All right!
Let's do this thing!

11:57.217 --> 11:58.092
Hey.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.555
By the way, before
you get too excited...

12:01.680 --> 12:03.557
All the nurses are actual
medical professionals.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.479
I'm here for the Bingham's.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.730
Mmm.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.568
And are you at all curious
about the problem of mine
that you created?

12:14.693 --> 12:15.694
Your virginity?

12:18.238 --> 12:19.738
Uh, I didn't create that,
the women of America did.

12:21.282 --> 12:23.159
I'm referring to
my work visa problem.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.328
Oh, yeah.
What's going on with dat?

12:25.453 --> 12:28.582
My work visa has expired,
thanks to you.

12:28.707 --> 12:29.708
You know what you should do?

12:29.832 --> 12:30.791
Renew it.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.920
I can't.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.881
I have to leave the
country and wait to get
back in line to return.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.550
It could be years.

12:38.675 --> 12:40.343
Well, can't you just,
you know,

12:40.468 --> 12:42.136
scale a fence or...

12:43.930 --> 12:45.306
Stow away in some
container ship?

12:47.642 --> 12:49.852
Or maybe float
to America in a bottle,
that's how Fievel did it.

12:51.396 --> 12:52.939
Ah, brilliant.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.233
If only I were
a cartoon mouse.

12:55.358 --> 12:56.109
You're closer
than you think.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.905
What?

13:01.989 --> 13:02.865
Come...

13:04.992 --> 13:06.494
Okay. You're doing great,
doing great.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.786
Just keep breathing,
keep breathing.

13:07.912 --> 13:09.080
Fourth and goal.
You're on the one.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.124
Just punch it in!
Break the plane!

13:11.249 --> 13:12.626
DOCTOR: She's coming.
(EXHALES)

13:12.751 --> 13:13.960
Keep pushing.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.420
(GRUNTS)
She's coming.

13:15.545 --> 13:17.088
Here she is!

I can drink again!

AUDREY:
Jeff, we have a daughter.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.392

13:36.316 --> 13:37.358
Oh, sorry, right.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.277
Hey, doc, way to go.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.072
Best for last.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.076
(BABY CRYING)

13:48.161 --> 13:49.454
Oh.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.915
(LAUGHS)

13:53.832 --> 13:55.335
Look at her.

13:55.460 --> 13:58.087
She's beautiful.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.297
Yeah, she's perfect.

14:02.258 --> 14:03.384
The head's gonna
round out though, right?

14:08.222 --> 14:10.266
...and then she
suckled my pinkie.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.851
My little baby,
she was so cute,

14:12.977 --> 14:14.228
dribbling and drooling
all over herself.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.605
Aw.

14:15.730 --> 14:16.356
Just like her daddy.

14:18.149 --> 14:20.694
Congratulations.
I can't wait to see her.

14:20.819 --> 14:25.281
And, hey, if anything
happens to you guys,
don't worry. We got her.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.658
I'll do whatever it takes
to outlive you.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.954
Listen, we're sorry all this
ruined your wedding.

14:32.079 --> 14:33.414
Oh, there's no need
to apologize.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.416
Yeah, none at all.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.252
Because you didn't ruin it.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.213
Do you, Alan,
take Jennifer...
Uh...

14:40.338 --> 14:41.088
Actually, it's Adam.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.300
Ah.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.260
Do you, Alan, take Adam...

14:46.386 --> 14:47.970
(CHUCKLES)

14:48.095 --> 14:49.180
I'm kidding.
That's a little
officiating humor.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.893
Do you, Adam,
take Jennifer to be your
lawfully wedded wife?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.480
Yeah, I do.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.399
And do you, Jennifer,
take Adam to be your
lawfully wedded husband?

15:00.316 --> 15:02.485
I do.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.404
Then by the powers
vested in me by
the state of New York,

15:04.529 --> 15:05.446
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.448
Finally.

15:10.535 --> 15:11.703
(SOBS)
I always cry at weddings.

15:13.037 --> 15:15.623
You may now...
Yes, that.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.542
Ahh, congratulations, guys.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.043
(TIMMY SIGHS)

15:19.168 --> 15:21.462
I'm going to miss all of you.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.798
Dude, there's gotta be
some way you can stay.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.841
Yeah, come on.
We'll all help.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.762
I appreciate that,
I really do.

15:28.887 --> 15:31.055
But I'm afraid I've exhausted
all the avenues and, um...

15:31.598 --> 15:32.432
Stop.

15:33.516 --> 15:34.809
Ooh, drama.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.356
I can't sit by
and do nothing.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.858
Timmy, you know
when I make a mistake,
I'm the first to admit it.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.697
Couldn't be less true.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.407
I've made a mistake.
I'm here to fix it.

15:49.532 --> 15:51.409
Really? How?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.746
Well, we've been
together a long time,

15:54.871 --> 15:57.164
and, uh,
I don't want it to end.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.959
I guess what
I'm trying to say is,

16:01.502 --> 16:02.712
Timmy Patel,
will you marry me?

16:06.633 --> 16:07.926
I knew it.

16:11.262 --> 16:14.891
Um, sir, what are you doing?

16:15.015 --> 16:16.434
If you marry a citizen,
they can't kick you
out of the country.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.146
Sir, I don't even
know what to say.

16:21.063 --> 16:22.482
(WHISPERS)
Just say yes.

16:26.569 --> 16:30.490
...and there may be times
filled with happiness,
sorrow, tears, or laughter.

16:30.615 --> 16:33.868
Whatever it may be,
remember love
has given you wings.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.119
How come we didn't
get the wings thing?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.748
I know.
Mambo would've loved that.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.876
So I'll now ask.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.128
Do you, Russell,
take Timir to be your
lawfully wedded spouse?

16:44.671 --> 16:46.923
I do.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.258
And do you, Timir,
take Russell to be your
lawfully wedded spouse?

16:49.383 --> 16:50.844
I do.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.303
Do I? Really?

16:54.096 --> 16:55.264
Oh, I feel nauseous.

16:59.143 --> 17:00.478
Wait till they kiss,
I'll be right there with you.

17:02.438 --> 17:04.440
And by the powers
vested in me by the
state of New York,

17:04.565 --> 17:06.901
I now pronounce
you are married.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.820
If you'd like to seal
this marriage with a kiss,
you may now do so.

17:18.997 --> 17:19.664
I don't think so.

17:20.832 --> 17:21.916
Yeah, no.

17:22.041 --> 17:22.917
Uh, of course not.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.338
So it's not just
in my mind anymore.

17:27.463 --> 17:28.882
You two are legally gay.

17:32.886 --> 17:34.094
Hello, little Shea.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.557
I'm your daddy.

17:39.350 --> 17:41.811
And I'm gonna do
the best I can
to take care of you.

17:44.564 --> 17:48.609
Now your mom, she can
go a little  Looney Tunes
every once in a while,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.528
but all in all,
she's a good egg.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.363
There you go.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.949
There you go.
Hey.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.744
How's she doing?
Oh, she's perfect.

17:57.869 --> 17:58.745
Well, yeah.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.163
Come here, you.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.750
Where'd you run off to?

18:03.875 --> 18:05.626
Well, you know,
I've been feeling
kind of sick lately,

18:05.752 --> 18:06.961
so I decided
to get checked out.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.215
Was it that pot roast
you made the other night?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.550
That was a swing and a miss.

18:17.889 --> 18:18.890
Jeff, I'm pregnant.

18:23.019 --> 18:24.353
What?
(GIGGLES)

18:24.478 --> 18:26.731
Really?
I know. It's crazy.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.525
I thought we couldn't.
I thought that it was
medically a no-go.

18:29.650 --> 18:32.152
I know. It's...
Well, it's a go.
It's definitely a go.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.030
(CHUCKLES)

18:39.911 --> 18:40.745
Is it okay to come in?

18:41.495 --> 18:42.288
Yeah, yeah.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.335
Oh, my God.
She's beautiful.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.170

18:50.296 --> 18:51.839

is our anniversary.

Giving you any ideas?

19:02.016 --> 19:04.184
I'm not quite
ready to be a dad.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.437
Uh, I'm the dad.
You're the lady.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.566

as a married couple.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.609

you guys actually did it.
