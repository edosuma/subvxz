-[door clicks]

02:48.646 --> 02:50.779
Nice run?

02:50.866 --> 02:53.129
Yeah, thanks.

02:53.216 --> 02:55.218
-She up yet?
-What do you think?

02:57.960 --> 03:00.005
-[Hailey] Sienna.
-Hmm?

03:04.140 --> 03:05.794
Come on.
We got packing to do.

03:06.577 --> 03:07.274
Go away.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.930
Three days. That's it,
and then you'll feel better.

03:12.670 --> 03:13.367
Sienna.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.154
I've invested too much time
in your recovery

03:18.285 --> 03:20.461
for you mess things up again,
okay?

03:24.508 --> 03:26.728
-Get up.
-Ah.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.078
Five minutes.

[pulsating music]

04:12.991 --> 04:14.254
[somber music]

04:19.563 --> 04:21.303
[Josh] So this is it?

04:21.391 --> 04:23.001
This is the place you learned
to be--

04:23.088 --> 04:24.786
[Hailey] ...a medic.

04:24.916 --> 04:27.702
We used to spend weeks up here
trekking through this forest.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.094
I hated it.

04:29.181 --> 04:31.140
[Josh] And you wanted
to come back. Why?

04:31.271 --> 04:33.447
I strangely missed it.

04:33.534 --> 04:36.276
The air, the nature,
secludedness.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.364
It's nice.

04:37.494 --> 04:39.582
I'm not sure Sienna
would ever like it.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.890
Yeah, well, she's nearly
over the hill.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.197
These next few days
will be rough for her, so...

04:45.241 --> 04:47.852
-We have to make an effort.
-Yes, Sarge.

04:47.939 --> 04:49.985
It's Captain to you.

04:50.028 --> 04:51.508
Permission to ask
a question, Captain?

04:52.074 --> 04:54.032
Hmm. What is it?

04:56.774 --> 04:58.036
[birds chirping]

05:02.084 --> 05:03.259
You know that...

05:04.173 --> 05:06.393
what we talked about?

05:12.355 --> 05:14.139
I think I'm ready
to start trying.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.577
[soft sentimental tune]

05:18.970 --> 05:20.494
Maybe even right now.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.018
[giggles] My sister
is right there.

05:23.061 --> 05:24.976
She's not gonna hear.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.935
[giggles] But seriously

05:27.022 --> 05:28.980
there's never perfect time

05:29.981 --> 05:31.592
or a place...

05:32.549 --> 05:34.638
when there's a perfect person

05:34.725 --> 05:35.987
-Hmm?
-[giggles]

05:38.990 --> 05:40.514
Did you just rehearse that?

05:41.602 --> 05:42.516
No...

05:44.735 --> 05:45.432
Come on.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.002

[foreboding music]

06:27.909 --> 06:30.128
Guys, guys.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.478
You have to see this.

06:33.915 --> 06:34.959
-Oh, God.
-[Hailey] Sienna.

06:35.046 --> 06:36.439
Guys, come on.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.020
This better be good.

06:55.153 --> 06:57.286
[Josh] Hailey!

06:57.373 --> 06:58.592
What could possibly--

06:59.854 --> 07:01.421
Wait.

07:03.074 --> 07:04.598
[intriguing music]

07:12.562 --> 07:15.609
Oh, my God.
I have to call Lyssa.

07:15.696 --> 07:18.089
-Is that what I think it is?
-I think so.

07:21.092 --> 07:22.224
It's beautiful.

07:25.314 --> 07:26.402
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.490
We don't know if it's friendly.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.144
I don't see the Army anywhere.

07:29.187 --> 07:30.798
What if it just got here?

07:30.841 --> 07:32.408
If they were here
to take over the world

07:32.495 --> 07:34.018
they would have done it
already.

07:37.892 --> 07:39.110
[suspenseful music]

07:44.115 --> 07:45.682
Wooh, wooh, wait, wait.

07:54.691 --> 07:55.692
Sienna?

07:56.911 --> 07:57.607
Sienna.

09:42.973 --> 09:44.801
Josh, Josh?

09:44.888 --> 09:45.802
You okay?

09:51.068 --> 09:52.809
Baby, wake up.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.250
What happened?

10:01.209 --> 10:02.210
I don't know.

10:04.342 --> 10:05.692
I guess they are not friendly.

10:07.171 --> 10:09.434
No, not at all.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.222
Oh, my phone's not working.

10:19.270 --> 10:21.403
How long were we are for?

10:21.490 --> 10:23.057
I don't know, it's night.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.015
Few hours?

10:25.102 --> 10:28.279
We need to go to the car.
We need to check the car radio.

10:28.366 --> 10:31.282
Yeah, good idea.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.632
Let's just hope it still works.

10:35.156 --> 10:36.287
Come on.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.519
[brooding music]

11:01.661 --> 11:03.967
Let's get packed up.

11:04.098 --> 11:05.882
Get the stuff to the car.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.870
-We have to go now.
-Go?

11:38.001 --> 11:38.698
[blast]

11:42.919 --> 11:43.877
But where?

11:59.240 --> 12:00.545
We're staying.

12:02.243 --> 12:04.245
We're staying, it's safer.

12:04.332 --> 12:05.855
-Okay.
-What?

12:08.815 --> 12:10.904
We can't go back.
What's the point?

12:10.991 --> 12:13.471
I'm going to sort out
the wood for the fire.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.604
Go to the car, check the radio.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.606
See if you can find out
what's going on.

12:17.693 --> 12:19.651
I need you to go to the car.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.175
I need you to grab
the lighter fluid.

12:21.262 --> 12:22.524
Can you do that?

12:25.396 --> 12:26.702
[sobs]

12:26.789 --> 12:28.573
The walk will do you good.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.575
It'll keep you warm.

12:30.662 --> 12:31.794
Josh, look after her.

12:33.187 --> 12:34.841
You'll be fine.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.103
I'll be fine.

12:36.190 --> 12:37.408
Okay

12:40.411 --> 12:41.978
[breathes heavily]

12:42.979 --> 12:44.154
Come on.

12:44.198 --> 12:45.503
You okay.

12:53.424 --> 12:54.948
[gasps]

13:04.044 --> 13:05.306
[white noise]

13:13.270 --> 13:14.445
[soft ominous music]

13:30.766 --> 13:31.811
Is the radio working, then?

13:33.508 --> 13:34.552
No, it's dead.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.555
Can you not just start the car?

13:37.642 --> 13:39.470
There's no point.

13:39.557 --> 13:41.995
What do you want from cars
that got computers.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.346
So whatever that was...

13:45.433 --> 13:46.695
would have fried everything...

13:48.305 --> 13:49.437
along with our phones.

13:53.354 --> 13:54.398
Yes.

14:14.810 --> 14:16.377
Okay, let's head back to camp.

14:19.510 --> 14:20.860
[whizzing noise]

14:28.389 --> 14:29.694
[suspenseful music]

14:39.139 --> 14:40.053
Let's go.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.841
[campfire sizzles]

14:53.153 --> 14:54.458
The car is dead.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.767
Managed to get it going?

15:29.580 --> 15:30.799
You got any food?

15:37.023 --> 15:39.155
I have some marshmallows...

15:41.027 --> 15:45.945
some bread...
some cheese, some soup.

15:47.511 --> 15:49.035
You got any water?

16:11.057 --> 16:12.972
[animal-like sound in distance]

16:22.024 --> 16:25.854
[Sienna] Guys,
there's something out there.

16:29.814 --> 16:30.859
[scare chord]

16:30.990 --> 16:32.774
Guys, there's something there.

16:34.950 --> 16:36.212
[Josh] Who is there?

16:39.520 --> 16:41.087
[Josh shouts] Stop.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.220
Stop!

16:45.047 --> 16:46.657
Stop.

16:46.744 --> 16:48.137
-Stop.
-[growls]

16:50.966 --> 16:53.012
Stay back, stay back.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.230
Stop!

16:56.319 --> 16:57.581
[thud]

17:01.237 --> 17:02.195
Is she okay?

17:04.501 --> 17:05.720
Is she...

17:05.762 --> 17:07.113
Check her pulse.

17:15.556 --> 17:16.470
[growls]

17:16.599 --> 17:18.559

[high-pitched roar]

17:29.961 --> 17:31.267
[animal growls in distance]

17:37.839 --> 17:40.015
There's more of them.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.495
We need to go.
Give me the bag.

17:41.582 --> 17:42.931
Pack the tents up.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.107
Pack up the tent.
Be careful.

17:46.369 --> 17:47.066
Come on.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.417
-Your hand.
-Don't worry about.

17:50.460 --> 17:52.680
Let's pack up the tent
and let's just go.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.116
Sienna, pack up the tent.

17:58.947 --> 18:00.862
[sinister tone]

18:09.131 --> 18:11.264
-Okay.
-[Hailey] We need to keep going.

18:11.351 --> 18:13.527
Your sister's not going
to go any further.

18:13.614 --> 18:14.919
Look, the further we are away

18:14.963 --> 18:16.747
the safer we'll be.
Come on.

18:16.834 --> 18:18.271
Hailey, I'm tired,
I'm hungry

18:18.358 --> 18:19.707
and we haven't seen
one of those things in a while.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.056
We're staying here.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.323
Are we staying or going?

18:57.701 --> 18:59.138
It's broken

19:00.530 --> 19:01.923
We need to keep moving.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.664
We can't just walk in the dark.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.927
[indistinct]

19:06.014 --> 19:07.233
I'm not leaving her.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.670
If we carry on walking
she'll follow us.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.324
Come on.

19:11.411 --> 19:14.109
You need to pick
her up and get out of here.

19:16.546 --> 19:17.286
Who are you?

19:21.986 --> 19:23.162
Those things are everywhere.

19:26.426 --> 19:27.470
What are they?

19:27.601 --> 19:30.256
I don't know, mate.

19:30.343 --> 19:33.215
But they don't stop.
So you shouldn't either.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.174
Stay quiet
and find a place to hide.

19:38.177 --> 19:39.395
Where are you hiding?

19:43.834 --> 19:45.662
I've been in my holiday home.

19:45.706 --> 19:46.924
Is it far?

19:55.237 --> 19:57.413
All right. You three look
like you need a hand.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.201
Stay quiet. Stay out of sight.

20:11.601 --> 20:12.994

[foreboding music]

21:10.356 --> 21:12.271

21:15.143 --> 21:16.449
[Liam] Run faster, please.

21:16.536 --> 21:17.928
[Hailey]
We're faster than them.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.930
[Liam] You don't get it.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.367
They don't stop.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.376
[gasps]

21:36.033 --> 21:37.470
Wait, wait, wait.

21:37.600 --> 21:38.993
This trail.
If we follow this trail

21:39.036 --> 21:41.822
we can make it to the coast
in about three or four days.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.127
Three or four days?

21:43.214 --> 21:44.738
If we keep up the pace,
we can stay ahead

21:44.825 --> 21:45.695
of those creatures.

21:45.782 --> 21:47.262
Ad you even trust this man?

21:47.393 --> 21:49.046
He seems
to know where he's going

21:49.177 --> 21:51.048
so I'm gonna take my chances

21:51.135 --> 21:53.529
-Hailey?
-She's right, Josh. Come on.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.534
Josh, come on.

22:09.893 --> 22:11.199
Come on love.

[gasps and groans]

22:34.091 --> 22:35.397

[screams]

22:41.838 --> 22:43.144
[pained whimper]

22:54.895 --> 22:56.636
You owe me one.

23:01.292 --> 23:03.686
Why have they stopped her?

23:03.817 --> 23:04.992
They're outnumbered.

23:05.732 --> 23:07.255
[roars]

23:17.091 --> 23:18.484
[Liam] Okay, we're clear.

23:22.313 --> 23:23.532
Josh, keep a lookout.

23:24.881 --> 23:26.230
-Map.
-Yeah.

24:43.569 --> 24:45.309
I'm sorry I brought you here.

24:49.226 --> 24:52.099
-I did it for you.
-I can't...

24:55.015 --> 24:57.670
I can't do this anymore.

24:57.757 --> 25:00.324
I need you to do
something to make it.

25:00.368 --> 25:01.630
I need to dig deep

25:04.154 --> 25:07.680
because we need to get
the hell out of here.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.725
You can, you can.

25:11.379 --> 25:13.729
Have I ever lied to you?
Have I?

25:15.818 --> 25:16.993
I promise you.

25:17.037 --> 25:19.605
I'm not going to let
anything happen to you.

25:20.562 --> 25:21.824
I swear.

25:21.955 --> 25:22.651
Okay?

25:37.144 --> 25:38.406
It's okay.

[Liam]
Right, it's just up here.

26:34.288 --> 26:37.421
-We call it Emerald Ridge.
-[Hailey] Who is we?

26:37.508 --> 26:39.119
Me and my business associates.

26:45.908 --> 26:48.563
We need to discuss terms
before we get there.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.609
-Terms?
-Yeah, terms.

26:51.914 --> 26:53.176
So what do you want?

26:53.263 --> 26:54.700
My house, my rules.

26:54.830 --> 26:57.572
So you do as I say
when I say it.

26:57.703 --> 26:59.705
Secondly, we're splitting
these supplies

26:59.792 --> 27:02.359
and thirdly,
you stay out of my tent.

27:03.491 --> 27:05.145
Specially her.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.844
[suspenseful music]

27:12.718 --> 27:13.719
Fine.

27:14.807 --> 27:15.851
Lead the way.

27:44.053 --> 27:45.881
[helicopter whirring]

27:57.588 --> 27:59.068
Hailey, give me some lights.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.331
Give me the flares,
give me the flares.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.727
[indistinct]

28:08.251 --> 28:09.470
Where is he going?

28:09.557 --> 28:10.689
To find the key ring.

28:20.133 --> 28:21.525
[indistinct]

28:23.310 --> 28:24.790
Don't just leave me here.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.469
What are you doing,
you stupid prick?

29:35.512 --> 29:36.557
Get off me.

[both grunt]

29:47.307 --> 29:48.569
[sting]

29:53.530 --> 29:54.749
[Hailey] Josh.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.884
Get off him.
Josh, you're gonna kill him.

[Hailey] Stop it. Stop it.

30:16.249 --> 30:18.642
You two, stop.

30:18.729 --> 30:20.340
Everyone knows where we are now.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.692
You're on your own.

30:24.779 --> 30:26.476
What the hell
are you playing at?

30:28.130 --> 30:29.436
It wasn't me.

30:29.479 --> 30:30.916
I wasn't in control.

30:34.267 --> 30:37.009
You just say the word
and I walk away, I promise.

30:38.532 --> 30:41.709
We stick together.

30:41.796 --> 30:43.885
Let's go
before he steals our stuff.

31:19.051 --> 31:21.792
-Where are you going?
-Over there.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.838
He's going to get us all killed.

31:23.969 --> 31:26.406
You can't just leave us here
with no food.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.538
Watch me.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.018
He was just trying to help.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.851
Please.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.075
[pulsing music]

32:16.238 --> 32:18.762
I think it's
an old Army compound

32:18.849 --> 32:20.764
but a landslide blocked
the only route in

32:21.635 --> 32:22.810
except one.

[suspenseful music]

33:15.645 --> 33:17.082

Sienna.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.458
-Sienna, come--
-Calm down.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.895
What happened to his hand
since last night?

34:31.982 --> 34:33.201
It'll get better tomorrow.

34:33.245 --> 34:34.811
Hailey, he's turning
into one of them.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.771
Be quiet, please.

34:37.813 --> 34:39.815
If that stuff in his hand
changes him

34:39.902 --> 34:41.340
we'll deal with it, okay?
I promise.

34:41.382 --> 34:43.907
Do you really want
to be stuck with Liam?

34:48.956 --> 34:51.219
Haily,
you can't hide this forever.

34:51.263 --> 34:53.525
-And if Liam sees it...
-He won't find out.

34:53.656 --> 34:54.962
-Okay?
-Okay.

35:02.361 --> 35:04.102
Everything all right out here
in Paradise?

35:14.024 --> 35:15.200
I found this old radio.

35:19.552 --> 35:20.509
Get it fixed.

35:20.596 --> 35:22.990
See if we can find out
anything useful.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.344
Care to give us a house tour?

35:31.346 --> 35:33.653
This ain't
the Four Seasons, mate.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.176
Stay out.

35:46.100 --> 35:48.189
What kind of a person
needs a hideout?

35:50.626 --> 35:52.237
The kind that survives.

36:09.645 --> 36:11.125
[eerie music builds up]

36:39.501 --> 36:41.068
[eerie music]

37:20.499 --> 37:23.589
You do realize that's
an old short wave radio.

37:23.632 --> 37:26.374
We're going to need
a battery and antenna.

37:26.418 --> 37:29.029
-We'll get more luck--
-Look, I'm just trying to help.

37:42.695 --> 37:44.000
I'm sorry.

37:51.704 --> 37:54.576
What's up?

37:54.663 --> 37:57.623
What strange is that is
in the middle of the forest

37:57.666 --> 38:01.235
and it only has a short wave,
a few miles max?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.019
So whoever originally
put that in that tent

38:03.150 --> 38:04.804
...was in range
of a bigger base.

38:04.891 --> 38:05.892
Exactly.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.329
So why don't we lead them out?

38:08.416 --> 38:11.593
I have to figure out
what it is first.

38:11.680 --> 38:12.812
I'll get some supplies.

38:12.942 --> 38:14.030
You can tell Sienna.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.336
She'll be more
compliant with you.

38:15.380 --> 38:16.598
And Liam?

38:16.685 --> 38:18.034
I can try.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.820
You really think we can
tear him away from Paradise.

than your man cave.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.896
When was the last time
you ate something?

38:55.594 --> 38:56.943
What do you care?

39:01.513 --> 39:03.732
Let's just say I've seen
what going cold turkey

39:03.819 --> 39:05.299
can do to a person.

39:17.833 --> 39:19.531
Where did you get those?

39:19.618 --> 39:20.793
Lets' say
there's a good reason

39:20.880 --> 39:22.447
why you need
to stay out of my tent.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.887
We might as well
have some fun, hadn't we

39:28.017 --> 39:29.105
Before they kill us...

39:32.021 --> 39:33.371
or worse.

Sienna.

44:36.978 --> 44:38.937
Hailey, Hailey.

44:40.155 --> 44:41.722
Look at me.

44:41.766 --> 44:42.680
Look at me.

44:44.203 --> 44:45.204
Ow.

45:13.798 --> 45:14.886
Liam.

45:19.368 --> 45:20.718
Liam.

45:25.984 --> 45:26.941
What?

45:34.427 --> 45:35.689
What did you give her?

45:38.561 --> 45:40.825
Look, I've seen
withdrawal before.

45:40.912 --> 45:43.828
Now isn't the time for her
to go cold turkey.

45:43.915 --> 45:46.395
You seem to think
of Sienna better than I do.

45:47.396 --> 45:48.615
You expect me to believe

45:48.746 --> 45:50.399
you did that
for any other reason

45:50.486 --> 45:52.010
than to take advantage of her?

46:01.846 --> 46:04.283
You dose my sister again--

46:04.370 --> 46:05.763
And you'll what?

46:11.943 --> 46:15.424
Is there anything else in there
you're hiding from us?

46:15.511 --> 46:16.817
More food, drugs...

46:18.297 --> 46:19.907
weapons?

46:19.951 --> 46:22.301
Any secrets you've got
you should be worried about.

46:23.868 --> 46:25.739
The water is contaminated.

46:29.525 --> 46:30.657
Thought you should know.

46:31.658 --> 46:33.312
Just wait for the rain.

46:33.442 --> 46:34.574
Yeah, what if it doesn't rain?

46:34.661 --> 46:36.837
Yeah, you seem to know it all.

46:38.317 --> 46:40.580
Know of any other freshwater
we could use?

46:42.234 --> 46:44.410
It's a bit of a trek.

46:44.497 --> 46:45.977
I'm going to need a hand.

46:46.064 --> 46:47.108
If you don't think

46:47.239 --> 46:49.067
you could do it by yourself
then let's go.

46:49.110 --> 46:51.112
You two can go.

46:51.243 --> 46:52.113
We're staying here

46:52.244 --> 46:53.680
considering
she can't go anywhere.

Look.

47:30.369 --> 47:31.500
It's not safe out there.

47:33.502 --> 47:34.808
So, be careful.

47:36.418 --> 47:37.724
Be careful of him.

48:37.436 --> 48:40.047
Right. I found some things
that can carry water.

48:41.657 --> 48:43.050
We'll line your back with these.

48:45.400 --> 48:46.140
I found this.

48:52.016 --> 48:54.018
You best hang onto this as well.

Come on, partner.

of those things earlier.

51:48.409 --> 51:49.758
When?

51:50.629 --> 51:51.934
I don't know.

51:53.327 --> 51:54.372
A few hours.

51:55.851 --> 51:57.375
We better get to move on.

51:58.941 --> 52:01.205
We are in the middle
of the forest.

52:01.335 --> 52:02.989
What could those things want?

52:04.991 --> 52:06.079
I dunno mate.

52:06.166 --> 52:08.081
If I were a betting man

52:08.212 --> 52:09.952
I'd say
they're looking for us two.

52:14.305 --> 52:16.655
Do you think we'll make it
back to camp?

52:18.744 --> 52:19.745
We can try.

52:23.357 --> 52:24.402

What did you do to me?

53:14.495 --> 53:15.975
I can't keep doing this.

53:18.804 --> 53:19.805
I'm tired.

53:32.687 --> 53:33.427
It'll pass.

53:36.648 --> 53:37.344
It always does.

53:42.523 --> 53:43.872
You killed me.

53:47.093 --> 53:48.399
Are you joking?

53:51.271 --> 53:52.794
Sienna, you're killing yourself.

53:58.322 --> 54:00.062
We only have each other, Sienna.

54:00.149 --> 54:01.629
And you keep doing
shit like this.

54:01.716 --> 54:02.891
You're not only gonna get
yourself killed

54:02.978 --> 54:04.284
but me too.

54:06.895 --> 54:08.332
What a shame that would be.

54:24.565 --> 54:26.045
[brooding music]

54:34.706 --> 54:36.360
[Josh]
So you know the forest well?

54:38.231 --> 54:39.841
[Liam] Not bad for a druggie.

54:41.756 --> 54:43.149
[Josh] I never called you that.

54:43.236 --> 54:44.411
But you did drug Sienna.

54:45.934 --> 54:47.980
I didn't force her, mate.

54:48.023 --> 54:49.111
You took advantage.

54:51.113 --> 54:52.289
You knew she was vulnerable.

54:58.382 --> 55:00.297
What are you going to do?
Report me?

55:02.037 --> 55:03.822
I'm not trying to start a fight.

55:03.952 --> 55:05.693
You sure about that?

55:05.780 --> 55:07.260
If you was in my position

55:07.391 --> 55:08.740
would you not try to do
the same thing?

55:08.827 --> 55:10.742
I'm just trying to get Sienna
and Hailey to safety.

55:10.829 --> 55:12.091
Safety?

55:12.178 --> 55:14.093
I've taken you three to safety

55:14.180 --> 55:16.922
and now I'm taking you to water.

55:17.009 --> 55:19.403
So I'm doing a much better job
than you, mate.

55:24.190 --> 55:25.496
That's for Sienna.

55:27.062 --> 55:27.976
Liam, stop.

55:28.063 --> 55:29.587
You two abandoned her.

55:29.630 --> 55:30.979
Liam, stop.

55:31.066 --> 55:33.982
I'm just asking you to do
one thing, just one thing.

55:40.424 --> 55:43.296
If something happens to me...

55:43.383 --> 55:45.559
then you're going to be
what they only have.

55:47.518 --> 55:49.520
Let's get the water
and get out of here.

55:59.617 --> 56:00.879
[grunts]

56:24.816 --> 56:25.947
Finally.

56:27.601 --> 56:28.820
Come on.

56:28.907 --> 56:30.430
[water running]

56:40.222 --> 56:41.920
[giggles] It's clear.

56:43.835 --> 56:45.532
I think you're
understanding, mate.

56:47.795 --> 56:49.667
That's going to be
a lot tougher getting back

56:49.710 --> 56:52.409
especially carrying
these water bottles.

56:52.496 --> 56:54.585
-It's your--
-Sh, sh, sh.

56:59.938 --> 57:01.200
[ominous music]

57:08.076 --> 57:09.208
She's looking the house.

57:09.295 --> 57:10.601
She will live?

57:13.473 --> 57:14.518
Something is not right.

57:18.739 --> 57:19.958
Be careful.

57:35.103 --> 57:36.975
[sinister tone]

57:58.257 --> 57:59.867
She's been shot.

57:59.954 --> 58:01.129
[sting]

58:02.304 --> 58:04.132
There's no blood.

58:04.219 --> 58:05.699
Just get the water and go.

58:19.017 --> 58:20.584
[Josh screams in pain]

58:25.763 --> 58:28.026
You have to [indistinct]
Let's have a look.

58:28.113 --> 58:30.332
I'm fine.

58:30.419 --> 58:32.117
You're not good
with a swollen arm.

58:32.204 --> 58:33.248
Stay off. I'm fine.

58:35.599 --> 58:36.687
I'm fine.

58:38.993 --> 58:40.255
Whatever you say, mate.

58:51.049 --> 58:52.050
Go.

[ominous music]

59:05.629 --> 59:06.630

Liam!

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:52.736
Liam.

1:00:53.867 --> 1:00:54.738
Help me.

Where is Josh?

1:04:44.968 --> 1:04:45.969
Liam.

1:05:00.070 --> 1:05:01.767
What the hell
happened out there?

1:05:03.508 --> 1:05:05.640
Liam knows.

1:05:05.727 --> 1:05:07.512
-Huh?
-He knows.

1:05:07.555 --> 1:05:08.905
Oh, shit.

1:05:11.820 --> 1:05:13.126
What happened to your face?

1:05:15.868 --> 1:05:17.565
I don't take it personally.

1:05:22.657 --> 1:05:24.442
I need to see if it was.

1:05:28.663 --> 1:05:29.795
I cannot control myself.

1:05:33.016 --> 1:05:35.105
We need to get out of here.

1:05:38.021 --> 1:05:39.022
Yeah.

1:05:39.674 --> 1:05:40.937
Yeah, we do.

1:06:51.616 --> 1:06:54.575
I guess we all have
to thank you for all of this.

1:06:55.446 --> 1:06:56.664
Sorry.

1:07:14.204 --> 1:07:15.901
You're just after another fix.

1:07:17.207 --> 1:07:18.251
So you want?

1:07:26.607 --> 1:07:27.913
It's your choice.

1:07:43.711 --> 1:07:46.497
Like you said

Where is Josh?

1:10:55.512 --> 1:10:57.209
We didn't hear about.
Get out.

1:10:57.296 --> 1:10:58.689
Something happened to his tent.

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:00.125
So?

1:11:00.255 --> 1:11:02.300
So we're going to go find him.

1:11:09.916 --> 1:11:11.267
Oh, shit.

1:11:14.922 --> 1:11:16.315
Josh?

1:11:32.112 --> 1:11:33.289
Josh, can you hear me?

1:11:34.594 --> 1:11:35.682
Hailey.

1:11:35.769 --> 1:11:37.031
Hailey.

1:11:40.383 --> 1:11:42.733
Josh, I will take you back.
Okay?

1:11:42.820 --> 1:11:44.952
This way. Come on.

1:11:45.605 --> 1:11:47.520

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:54.309
Hailey. Someone helps.

1:11:56.268 --> 1:11:58.531
He's too far.
He needs to go now.

1:11:58.618 --> 1:11:59.619
Just go and call Hailey.

1:11:59.750 --> 1:12:02.273
[Liam] You need to let him
rest in peace.

1:12:03.797 --> 1:12:05.059
[Sienna] Hailey.

1:12:05.190 --> 1:12:07.410
[Liam]
Stop calling your sister.

[Liam indistinct

1:12:09.934 --> 1:12:12.197

1:12:19.117 --> 1:12:20.553
[distorted voice] Josh?

1:12:24.601 --> 1:12:26.342
Josh.

1:12:31.172 --> 1:12:32.434
[Liam] Hailey.

1:12:39.224 --> 1:12:40.356
Josh, wake up.

1:12:41.835 --> 1:12:42.532
Hailey.

1:12:48.014 --> 1:12:49.974
Josh.

1:12:50.061 --> 1:12:51.496
What the hell happened to him?

1:12:51.541 --> 1:12:54.108
-He's gone into the tunnel.
-He's turning, Hailey.

1:12:54.195 --> 1:12:55.893
We need to get him in your tent.

1:12:56.023 --> 1:12:57.155
He needs somewhere warm.

1:12:57.242 --> 1:12:59.070
He is not going in my tent.

1:12:59.112 --> 1:13:00.550
Liam, he's going in your tent.

1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:02.465
Please, dont' be stupid,
just help me.

1:13:06.164 --> 1:13:07.905
Liam, please, come on.

1:13:07.992 --> 1:13:09.123
Christ.

1:13:11.952 --> 1:13:13.911
Move the bed.

1:13:13.998 --> 1:13:14.999
Move the bed.

1:13:19.960 --> 1:13:21.353
Stay with me.

1:13:22.441 --> 1:13:23.877
We need to keep him awake.

1:13:23.921 --> 1:13:26.139
Every time he falls asleep
he gets worse.

1:13:26.271 --> 1:13:27.751
Do you have any stimulant
or anything?

1:13:27.838 --> 1:13:29.143
Yes.

1:13:29.230 --> 1:13:31.494
Hey, baby. Stay awake.

1:13:31.581 --> 1:13:33.626
Look at me.
Please, stay awake.

Come on.

1:13:56.780 --> 1:13:58.085

1:14:02.046 --> 1:14:04.264
Haley!

1:14:04.352 --> 1:14:06.616
[gasps] What the hell
are you doing?

1:14:06.702 --> 1:14:08.705
He's too far gone.

1:14:08.748 --> 1:14:11.403
It's not like you said.
He still has time.

1:14:11.490 --> 1:14:12.969
You don't get it, Hailey.

1:14:14.362 --> 1:14:16.016
I've seen this before.

1:14:16.103 --> 1:14:17.409
Liam, please.

1:14:17.975 --> 1:14:19.455
Liam, wait.

1:14:21.413 --> 1:14:23.067
Just let her say goodbye.

1:14:28.986 --> 1:14:30.030
It's too dangerous.

1:14:30.117 --> 1:14:32.337
Tie him up, just--

1:14:33.730 --> 1:14:34.992
Just give me this.

1:14:35.079 --> 1:14:36.297
Please.

1:14:45.871 --> 1:14:46.568
One hour.

1:14:49.528 --> 1:14:51.225
One hour and then I'm doing it.

1:15:03.324 --> 1:15:04.587
[eerie music]

1:15:06.675 --> 1:15:07.677
[Liam] It's time.

1:15:12.029 --> 1:15:14.597
All is changing
if you like it or not.

1:15:16.380 --> 1:15:18.339
We need to adapt and learn.

1:15:45.279 --> 1:15:46.585
[Liam] Haley.

1:15:56.508 --> 1:15:57.770
Come on, Hailey. It's time.

1:16:06.344 --> 1:16:07.737
Get off Josh, please.

1:16:17.050 --> 1:16:17.790
Last chance.

1:16:34.981 --> 1:16:36.112
I can make it painless.

1:16:48.299 --> 1:16:50.693
I've seen those things
rip my friends apart.

1:17:01.355 --> 1:17:03.401
You have no idea
how dangerous he is.

1:17:09.712 --> 1:17:11.627
This is the best thing for him

1:17:11.714 --> 1:17:13.454
and the best thing for us.

1:17:20.897 --> 1:17:21.811
Please, may I?

1:17:46.835 --> 1:17:47.837
[Hailey screams]

1:17:54.844 --> 1:17:56.410
Put your hands
behind your back.

1:18:09.510 --> 1:18:11.643
[whispers] Put your hands
behind your back.

1:19:41.733 --> 1:19:43.822
I'll give him some [indistinct]

1:19:47.652 --> 1:19:49.436
Quick and painless.

1:20:00.404 --> 1:20:01.840
You can say goodbye.

1:20:23.253 --> 1:20:24.689
[scare chord]

1:20:39.791 --> 1:20:41.358
[Liam] Don't worry.

1:20:43.708 --> 1:20:44.927
I won't abandon you.

1:20:48.495 --> 1:20:50.062
She can check on him.

Help me.

1:27:02.826 --> 1:27:03.957
Come on, Sienna.

1:27:04.088 --> 1:27:06.090
We have to go.
We can't stay here.

1:27:07.309 --> 1:27:08.309
Sienna.

1:27:10.050 --> 1:27:11.487
I've got a better idea.

1:27:13.532 --> 1:27:14.228
Please.

What are you doing?

Bend on your knees.

1:28:25.561 --> 1:28:27.954
Liam. No!

1:28:28.041 --> 1:28:29.565
She's done nothing for you.

1:28:31.654 --> 1:28:33.830
She was going to run away
with that thing

1:28:33.916 --> 1:28:35.048
take all of our supplies

1:28:35.179 --> 1:28:36.267
and leave us here to run.

1:28:36.398 --> 1:28:37.355
He's lying, it was for you.

1:28:37.398 --> 1:28:39.139
I swear, I promise, Sienna.

1:28:41.968 --> 1:28:43.709
Bullshit.

1:28:43.796 --> 1:28:44.928
Sienna.

1:28:45.014 --> 1:28:47.452
Make another move,
and I put one in your leg.

1:28:56.418 --> 1:28:58.420
To [indistinct] this world.

1:29:03.163 --> 1:29:05.165
[indistinct] survive.

1:29:05.209 --> 1:29:07.559
And that's-- [growls]

1:29:07.646 --> 1:29:08.343
Hailey.

1:29:12.041 --> 1:29:13.478
[Sienna] Run, run.

1:30:00.482 --> 1:30:02.484
Sienna, come on.
We have to go.

1:30:25.071 --> 1:30:26.986
[sighs]

1:30:33.514 --> 1:30:35.430
He was giving lot of shit
helping you.

1:30:43.742 --> 1:30:45.657
But you won't be here
if you run.

1:30:50.401 --> 1:30:51.489
I'm not going anywhere.

1:30:51.532 --> 1:30:53.404
If you're staying, I'm staying.

1:30:53.491 --> 1:30:54.666
If you're done, I'm done.

1:31:08.898 --> 1:31:10.246
Sorry about Josh.

1:31:18.995 --> 1:31:20.257
Me too.

1:31:46.152 --> 1:31:48.067

[thud]

1:36:14.507 --> 1:36:15.813
[music fades down]

1:36:37.269 --> 1:36:38.531
[distorted voice] Sienna?

1:36:52.415 --> 1:36:53.677
Sienna.

1:36:55.460 --> 1:36:56.811
Sienna.

1:37:14.916 --> 1:37:15.960
Sienna.

1:37:19.702 --> 1:37:21.966
