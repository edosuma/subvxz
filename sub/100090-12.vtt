WEBVTT

00:04.352 --> 00:06.354
- That's definitely our baby.

00:06.397 --> 00:08.225
- We're not meant
to be together.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.314
But we're meant
to be a family.

00:10.358 --> 00:13.143
- Darius, it's time to start
working for the police.

00:13.187 --> 00:14.536
- I get it.
I'm a snitch.

00:14.579 --> 00:16.929
- I got something good, girl.
Your new CI, Darius--

00:18.279 --> 00:20.933
10-1, 10-1.
Shots fired at the police.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.500
We're still going to use him

00:22.544 --> 00:24.285
even though he might have
just offed a CI?

00:24.328 --> 00:26.026
- We got to keep him in play.
He's valuable.

00:26.069 --> 00:27.070
- He was my guy.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.724
I put him out there.

00:28.767 --> 00:31.509
- I'm sure his death
is the cost of the game,

00:31.553 --> 00:33.033
but you're the one
who has to carry.

00:33.076 --> 00:35.209
- How do I do that?

00:37.950 --> 00:39.604
- Pregnant and undercover.

00:39.648 --> 00:41.476
It's a good name
for a reality show.

00:41.519 --> 00:42.955
- Ha.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.696
Yeah, I'm not gonna
lie to you, man,

00:44.740 --> 00:48.396
this whole thing makes me
nervous, but she loves the job.

00:48.439 --> 00:50.528
She wants to get as much time
out here as she can

00:50.572 --> 00:51.964
before she's got to go
on light duty,

00:52.008 --> 00:53.140
so here we are.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.533
- It's badass, no doubt.
- Thanks, man.

00:55.577 --> 00:59.363
Yeah, can you imagine the
stories we'll tell this kid?

00:59.407 --> 01:01.713
- Ross, fill us in.
- All right.

01:01.757 --> 01:04.194
Our target is the DTO
we've been jamming on.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.848
Finally getting a chance
to buy up.

01:05.891 --> 01:08.285
I'm fronting as an in-between
for a big player.

01:08.329 --> 01:10.940
I mean, today is step one, a
test ride, quarter brick of H.

01:10.983 --> 01:13.203
I take it to my boss,
make sure he likes the product,

01:13.247 --> 01:14.639
we do a major sale next week.

01:14.683 --> 01:16.554
At least that's
what my guy thinks.

01:16.598 --> 01:19.253
Instead, we take down
my guy today, flip him.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.472
- Great, we'll have eyes
on you inside and out.

01:21.516 --> 01:24.084
I'll be up top, Kev and Kim
will be right there with you.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.389
Adam and Jay
will take your guy down

01:25.433 --> 01:26.782
as soon as he hits the street.

01:26.825 --> 01:28.914
- Dibs.
- All you, dawg.

01:30.046 --> 01:33.049
- All right.
Okay, it's show time.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.746
- So what's
the takedown signal?

01:34.790 --> 01:36.183
- Raspberry.

01:36.226 --> 01:37.749
- Cute.
- Let's roll.

01:37.793 --> 01:38.968
- I like that.

01:40.448 --> 01:43.146
- Thank you.
- Next?

01:45.757 --> 01:47.237
- Here we go.

02:07.692 --> 02:09.390
- Hi, you.
- How are you doing?

02:09.433 --> 02:11.566
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

02:15.309 --> 02:18.181
- So, um...

02:18.225 --> 02:19.791
- What?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.402
- What do you think
about having dinner next week?

02:21.445 --> 02:24.840
- Well, I'm a big eater.
Fair warning.

02:28.191 --> 02:30.193
Raspberry.

02:30.237 --> 02:32.195
- Let's go.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.806
- South side.
Leather jacket, jeans.

02:36.373 --> 02:38.419
- No, do not approach.

02:38.462 --> 02:40.725
- What's the story here,
Hailey?

02:40.769 --> 02:43.424
- He's coming right at me.
What's the play?

02:43.467 --> 02:46.818
- I repeat, do not engage.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.312
- Yo, what the hell was that?

03:02.356 --> 03:04.793
It took me weeks
to get in there, we had a plan.

03:04.836 --> 03:06.577
- Yeah, we didn't plan
for one thing.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.710
Your dope dealer?
He's a cop.

03:10.581 --> 03:13.193
- Damn.
- Yeah.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.286
- What happened?

03:19.329 --> 03:21.288
- My dealer.

03:24.204 --> 03:25.379
- One of us.

03:25.422 --> 03:27.250
- Kelly Tyler.
PO.

03:27.294 --> 03:29.383
Assigned to Area
South Mission Team, TAC.

03:29.426 --> 03:31.515
- 11-year veteran.
Nothing but standard beefs.

03:31.559 --> 03:34.126
- And we're sure it's him?
- Yeah.

03:34.170 --> 03:35.476
We went
to the Academy together.

03:35.519 --> 03:37.173
He might've asked me out
on a date.

03:38.522 --> 03:40.045
I might've said no.

03:40.089 --> 03:42.483
- Well, maybe he was just
doing what we're doing.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.311
Got our wires crossed.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.530
Could've been detailed
to DA, Customs--

03:46.574 --> 03:48.228
- We deconflicted
before we got here.

03:48.271 --> 03:50.534
And now we were going through
the list of all the agencies,

03:50.578 --> 03:51.927
checked A and A records.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.494
- There's nothing
that suggests he's here

03:53.537 --> 03:56.540
in any official capacity.

03:56.584 --> 03:59.456
- You're saying he's dirty?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.328
- We're saying
what we know to be true.

04:01.371 --> 04:03.243
We have no reason
to believe Kelly Tyler

04:03.286 --> 04:04.244
was here working today.

04:04.287 --> 04:05.810
He was selling heroin.

04:14.341 --> 04:17.126
- Okay.

04:17.169 --> 04:19.389
Tell me something I don't know.

04:19.433 --> 04:22.784
- Well, we scrubbed Tyler's
personal financials.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.002
Dude lives well.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.570
- "Well."
He lives in Portage Park.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.659
- With the rest of the cops.
- Sure.

04:28.703 --> 04:32.272
And then a couple of years ago,
he bought this in cash.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.795
Door County.
Lakefront property.

04:33.838 --> 04:35.579
- He also rents a storage unit.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.190
- Which is the corporate
address of a cash-only LLC

04:38.234 --> 04:39.670
that does absolutely nothing.

04:39.714 --> 04:41.585
- And it's run by a shell
corporation, which somehow

04:41.629 --> 04:44.632
was founded by his mother.
Three years after she died.

04:44.675 --> 04:47.417
- All right, the way we left
things at the bus depot,

04:47.461 --> 04:49.941
Tyler thought we had
a successful exchange, right?

04:49.985 --> 04:51.508
Got a good thing going.

04:51.552 --> 04:54.337
- Well, I texted him, you know,
just to keep the vibe alive.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.599
Told him my boss
enjoyed the product,

04:55.643 --> 04:57.688
we're ready to do this.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.691
Dude left me on read.
Just ghosted me.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.824
- He's spooked.
He's a pro.

05:02.867 --> 05:05.522
- 'Cause he's a cop.
- Yeah, a veteran cop.

05:05.566 --> 05:09.396
So he's gonna think like us
and move like us.

05:09.439 --> 05:12.790
We exercise extreme precaution.

05:12.834 --> 05:15.358
But I want a sneak and peek
on that storage unit.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.708
Off the books.
Invisible.

05:17.752 --> 05:22.060
So no fingerprints,
real or digital.

05:42.559 --> 05:44.344
- All clear.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.302
- We're set up at the south.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.348
- Almost there.

05:48.391 --> 05:50.524
Come on, man.
Let's go.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.067
Yo.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.420
Tyler must be using this
like some kind of stash house.

06:17.464 --> 06:18.987
- Damn.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.119
I know he's a TAC guy
and they gotta bend the rules

06:21.163 --> 06:23.774
here and there, but that's
a hell of a lot of product.

06:31.347 --> 06:32.870
- You got company.
Copy?

06:32.914 --> 06:34.481
Tyler is here.
- Yeah, copy.

06:34.524 --> 06:35.873
We gotta go.
- Yeah.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.921
- What are you doing?

06:44.142 --> 06:47.798
- He's right on top of you.
Get out now.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.888
- Jay, I can hear
the elevator, man.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.761
- Yeah, all right.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

06:53.804 --> 06:55.415
Let's go, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

06:58.853 --> 06:59.854
Go.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.033
All right, let's move.

07:19.874 --> 07:22.659
- I hate to say it.
I hate to do it.

07:22.703 --> 07:26.924
But we're there.
Roll him up.

07:28.796 --> 07:32.147
- Hey, Sarge.
We can't move just yet.

07:34.105 --> 07:36.020
I think there's
another cop involved.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.765
- Shut the door.

07:44.115 --> 07:46.988
- So remember about a year ago?
We did a drug case

07:47.031 --> 07:49.425
where we seized six half-bricks
of H over in Lawndale?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.774
- The guy
with the fake bread truck.

07:50.818 --> 07:52.907
- So after he pleaded out,
I put in the destroy order

07:52.950 --> 07:54.778
for the dope down
at the South Side Drug Vault.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.954
I did the paperwork
with ERPS and Forensics--

07:56.998 --> 07:59.087
- Yes, incinerated
in the big burn, dope's gone.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.523
- Except it wasn't.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.612
I found some of it last night
in Tyler's storage unit.

08:02.656 --> 08:04.527
So I went down
to the Review Officer,

08:04.571 --> 08:06.224
and I pull up stuff
from the old case.

08:06.268 --> 08:09.053
It's the same dope.
This is like a baseball thing.

08:09.097 --> 08:10.794
The guy was using it
as a signature,

08:10.838 --> 08:14.015
putting it on his packages
like a company logo.

08:14.058 --> 08:15.146
Look at this.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.629
- That's your writing.

08:19.673 --> 08:22.327
- Who signed the order
said the dope was destroyed?

08:22.371 --> 08:24.547
- Sergeant Jake Gibbs.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.506
Apparently he's worked
in the drug vault

08:26.549 --> 08:28.159
for, like, a thousand years.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.335
But guess who took a turn in
the vault when he was a rookie?

08:30.379 --> 08:32.163
- Kelly Tyler.

08:32.207 --> 08:34.252
- If Tyler's dirty and he's got
someone inside the drug vault--

08:34.296 --> 08:35.993
- Yeah, it's like a buffet.
It's free dope.

08:36.037 --> 08:38.213
- If this is what it seems,
it's a whole new thing.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.345
I got to loop in Crawford.

08:40.389 --> 08:41.912
And we can't move on anybody

08:41.956 --> 08:44.828
till we know exactly how deep
this thing really goes.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.614
So just widen the net.
Gibbs, Tyler,

08:47.657 --> 08:50.530
and whoever the hell else
comes our way.

08:50.573 --> 08:51.748
- Trackers?
- Do it.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.358
Both of their
personal vehicles.

09:03.151 --> 09:05.545
- Here we go.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.206
That's Jake Gibbs,
the guy from the drug vault.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.338
- Well, there it is.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.079
Confirmation
they're working together.

09:18.122 --> 09:20.690
- Yeah.
- Guys, we got a bogey.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.431
Unknown third vehicle
headed your way.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.563
It's a silver SUV.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.665
- That's Darius Walker.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.667
- Holy crap.

09:42.756 --> 09:44.192
- You got that right.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.430
- You planning on telling me
you're in business with cops?

10:05.474 --> 10:07.302
- What?

10:07.345 --> 10:09.478
- You think I'm stupid?

10:09.521 --> 10:12.089
- Hold up, wait a minute.
What do you expect from me?

10:12.133 --> 10:14.178
You think I'm gonna volunteer
to a cop

10:14.222 --> 10:16.398
who's got a fat prison term
hanging over my head?

10:16.441 --> 10:19.662
That there are dirty cops
out there selling me dope?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.708
- How long have you been
in business with them?

10:25.407 --> 10:26.669
- Maybe four years.

10:26.713 --> 10:29.672
They're good suppliers.
Reliable.

10:29.716 --> 10:30.934
I mean, they should be.

10:30.978 --> 10:33.937
They got everything
right at their fingertips.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.766
They're just--
they're just the help.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.160
Bag men.
All right, man.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.640
Don't get me wrong,
they're dirty as hell,

10:40.683 --> 10:42.598
but they got a boss,
somebody big.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.121
Bigger than you.
- Who is it?

10:44.165 --> 10:45.166
- I don't know.
- Who is it?

10:45.209 --> 10:46.776
- I don't know!

10:46.820 --> 10:48.430
It's part of our deal,

10:48.473 --> 10:51.259
so I got nothing left
to offer you.

10:51.302 --> 10:54.262
- You gotta be kidding me.

10:54.305 --> 10:55.916
Darius, you're gonna help me
figure it out.

10:55.959 --> 10:57.918
- Oh, that ain't happening.
- Oh, yeah, it is.

10:57.961 --> 11:03.358
Darius, you work for me.
That's how this goes.

11:03.401 --> 11:05.186
Bro, I'm the only reason
you're out here,

11:05.229 --> 11:07.101
not doing burpees
in a prison cell.

11:07.144 --> 11:08.972
- Correct.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.280
And I ain't gonna jump
off a building for you neither.

11:13.977 --> 11:16.676
You think these gang bangers
out here are dangerous?

11:18.155 --> 11:20.244
Try dirty cops.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.380
- Name your price.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.603
- Come in.

11:31.647 --> 11:35.477
You can leave it open.
- No, shut it.

11:35.520 --> 11:39.220
- What's up?

11:39.263 --> 11:42.179
- We got two bad cops
out there.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.443
Kelly Tyler, some TAC guy.

11:45.487 --> 11:49.056
And Jake Gibbs, sergeant.
Runs the South Side Drug Vault.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.710
- What?

11:50.753 --> 11:53.713
- I got solid evidence they're
selling drugs on the street.

11:53.756 --> 11:54.888
Maybe others too.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.628
- Protocol says
you take this to IAD.

11:56.672 --> 11:58.152
- No way.
Case like this,

11:58.195 --> 12:01.459
the only people I trust are the
ones I can see from my desk.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.157
- Okay, so what are
you doing here then?

12:03.200 --> 12:06.464
- Well, I got a way in.

12:06.508 --> 12:09.641
But I need your co-sign.
- Uh-huh.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.557
- Turns out Darius Walker
has been buying narcotics

12:12.601 --> 12:14.342
from these guys for years.

12:14.385 --> 12:16.953
- That's--that's perfect.

12:16.997 --> 12:19.477
- Yeah, well, Darius is willing
to help us participate

12:19.521 --> 12:22.002
in a significant drug buy,
which we will document.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.699
Sworn testimony,
the whole thing.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.353
- But?

12:25.396 --> 12:28.573
- But the only way
he's gonna do it

12:28.617 --> 12:33.187
is if it's his last case
working for us.

12:33.230 --> 12:37.191
He makes this case, Darius has
met his burden, and then some.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.236
- Even a documented sale
to Darius,

12:39.280 --> 12:41.238
it might not be enough.
These are cops.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.198
They can claim
plausible deniability.

12:44.241 --> 12:46.548
I mean, Hank, for all we know,

12:46.591 --> 12:48.811
they build case initiatives
for everybody they sell to.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.987
They create a record.
They make it look legit.

12:51.031 --> 12:54.295
- Yeah, that's what I do.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.906
Let me remind you,

12:56.950 --> 12:58.821
a case this big,

12:58.865 --> 13:02.172
showing you're not afraid
to take on corruption,

13:02.216 --> 13:05.567
that's a hell of a bullet
on a résumé.

13:10.006 --> 13:11.703
- It won't be easy.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.709
- All right, everybody here?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.761
Okay, let's walk through
the steps one last time.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.981
- Okay, so we believe
the key to this whole thing

13:28.024 --> 13:29.678
is the South Side Drug Vault.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.854
Cops seize narcotics off the
street, and they put them into

13:31.898 --> 13:33.987
the vault, where it's stored
until it's needed as evidence.

13:34.030 --> 13:35.771
- All right, once a month,
they do a huge burn.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.381
They take all the drugs
they don't need as evidence

13:37.425 --> 13:38.861
and they bring it
to a blast furnace.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.602
- All right, and that's
really the loophole.

13:40.645 --> 13:42.082
The big burn is how
they cover their tracks

13:42.125 --> 13:43.344
with fake paperwork.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.867
- Destroy orders come
into the vault,

13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
orders from cops
to incinerate narcotics.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.175
Gibbs signs off on those,

13:48.218 --> 13:49.785
so there are no
checks and balances.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.787
- There's no system in place
to make sure that the stuff

13:51.831 --> 13:53.615
that actually goes into
the burner is really gone.

13:53.658 --> 13:56.139
- And why would there be?

13:56.183 --> 13:57.880
- Okay, how do we prove it?

13:57.924 --> 13:59.621
- It all starts
with the manifest.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.623
- There's a running list
of each type of narcotic

14:01.666 --> 14:02.798
stored in this drug vault.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.887
A key of coke,
half-key of MDMA--

14:04.931 --> 14:06.715
- And we know how much heroin
is in there right now.

14:06.758 --> 14:08.369
- Like two keys, give or take.

14:08.412 --> 14:11.372
- So we're gonna ask Darius
to ask for a lot more than that

14:11.415 --> 14:14.244
on purpose--
a bigger score, bigger payday.

14:14.288 --> 14:15.637
- And that's how
we flush them out,

14:15.680 --> 14:17.465
figure out who else
is involved.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.294
The play is, we escalate
the amount of the buy.

14:20.337 --> 14:23.036
It should press Tyler and Gibbs
to kick the deal upstairs

14:23.079 --> 14:26.604
to whoever they're working for.
The third cop.

14:26.648 --> 14:28.476
- Right, that's where
Sergeant Platt comes in.

14:28.519 --> 14:29.825
She's gonna bring them
the product

14:29.869 --> 14:31.479
based on her relationship
with Gibbs.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.394
- Yeah, I've known Jake
for almost 30 years,

14:33.437 --> 14:34.656
or thought I did.

14:34.699 --> 14:37.180
- All right, so we got
10 bricks of heroin,

14:37.224 --> 14:38.355
two bricks of coke.

14:38.399 --> 14:39.922
- We got tracers in the heroin?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.532
- They have their own
chemical footprint.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.230
So when they sell it to Darius,
we'll be able to test them

14:43.273 --> 14:44.492
and make sure
it's the same stuff,

14:44.535 --> 14:45.754
even if they change
the packaging.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.408
- Sarge, we're gonna
need you to front

14:47.451 --> 14:48.975
like the dope isn't tied
to any active cases.

14:49.018 --> 14:52.282
That nobody's gonna need it
for court or evidence.

14:52.326 --> 14:53.501
It can go straight
to the furnace.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.937
And if we're correct,

14:54.981 --> 14:56.852
it'll go straight
into their pockets instead.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.767
- They'll tell us
it's been incinerated,

14:58.810 --> 15:00.682
and they'll sell it
to Darius Walker.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.553
- And that's the trap.

15:04.947 --> 15:07.341
Hailey.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.299
You okay with this?

15:09.343 --> 15:12.172
- With what?

15:12.215 --> 15:15.479
- This play's tough enough
without triggering an old beef.

15:15.523 --> 15:19.005
Can you work
with Darius Walker?

15:19.048 --> 15:22.530
- Last time I checked,
this wasn't a democracy.

15:31.582 --> 15:34.324
- Hey, Jake.
- You kidding me?

15:34.368 --> 15:36.761
Been way too long, Trudy.
- Uh-huh.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.546
- You and Mouse,
you tied the knot, right?

15:38.589 --> 15:39.982
- Yes, we did.
- How's he doing?

15:40.026 --> 15:42.985
- Well, you know,
dashing, dastardly.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.118
- So same as ever.
- Yeah, how about you?

15:45.161 --> 15:49.035
It's been what?
Two years since Helen passed?

15:49.078 --> 15:50.297
You know, Jake,

15:50.340 --> 15:51.907
we're always here for you,
no matter what.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.040
- I know.
Part of the blue code.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.258
- Yeah.

15:55.302 --> 15:56.999
- Somebody's been busy.
Nice hit.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.349
- Not me.
Some of my patrol guys.

15:59.393 --> 16:03.788
That's a destroy order, 10 keys
of heroin and two of coke.

16:03.832 --> 16:05.790
- You got a court case number
attached to this?

16:05.834 --> 16:07.575
- No, straight to the oven.

16:07.618 --> 16:09.359
Well-being call,
out near Midway.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.318
Dead guy, dead case.
No one to charge.

16:11.361 --> 16:14.016
- Sometimes just getting it
off the street is the win.

16:14.060 --> 16:15.278
- Amen.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.542
- Good to see you again, Trudy.
- You too.

16:18.586 --> 16:21.545
- I'm not hearing
anything new.

16:21.589 --> 16:23.504
I gotta go.

16:23.547 --> 16:25.680
Darius make the ask?
- Yup.

16:25.723 --> 16:28.683
He asked Tyler for
six keys of 10, 50 gram per.

16:28.726 --> 16:30.598
- You think they bought it?

16:30.641 --> 16:32.556
- We'll have to find out
the hard way.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.169
- I got it.

16:36.212 --> 16:37.692
They just did
this month's big burn.

16:37.735 --> 16:39.824
Confirmation signed
by Jake Gibbs.

16:39.868 --> 16:42.436
The narcotics I checked
into the drug vault

16:42.479 --> 16:44.264
have been incinerated.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.614
Allegedly.
- Great.

16:46.657 --> 16:49.660
- Huh.

16:49.704 --> 16:51.010
- Right on time.

16:51.053 --> 16:53.447
- Talk to me.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.449
Yup.

16:55.492 --> 16:57.973
No, we'll bring it to you
at the motel.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.105
We're on.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.113
- I need to test your wire.
Talk to me for a sec.

17:07.156 --> 17:09.941
I understand you have plans
for going straight.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.552
Heard you bought a mall.

17:11.595 --> 17:14.903
A strip mall, big difference.

17:14.946 --> 17:17.906
It's a urban renewal
kind of thing.

17:17.949 --> 17:20.648
All about access.
- Yeah.

17:20.691 --> 17:24.130
You're a real hero, Darius.
Give me that back.

17:29.483 --> 17:32.051
Do you remember a guy
named Cameron Balow?

17:37.534 --> 17:41.016
- Yeah.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.539
- He was my CI.

17:42.583 --> 17:47.109
Like you're Voight's CI,
he was mine.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
Sort of like
we came up together.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.244
Two sides of the same street.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.729
He saw your face,
so you had him killed.

17:58.773 --> 18:01.210
He died right in front of me.

18:04.126 --> 18:08.087
So you tell yourself
whatever story you want to

18:08.130 --> 18:10.219
about the life
you think you're living.

18:10.263 --> 18:13.135
But don't forget the truth.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.444
The truth is,
you're the kind of man

18:17.487 --> 18:21.883
that has people killed just
because they saw your face.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.145
- Wrong place, wrong time.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.408
- Mm.
Just some bad luck.

18:25.452 --> 18:27.149
- Well, now,
if you believe in luck,

18:27.193 --> 18:29.325
that means you believe
that the universe

18:29.369 --> 18:30.935
gives a damn about your fate.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.156
There's no luck on the streets.
Only choices.

18:34.200 --> 18:37.507
One after the next.

18:37.551 --> 18:42.164
Young Cameron,
he made a bad choice.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.688
- Mm.
- He wasn't unlucky.

18:44.732 --> 18:47.952
He was foolish.

18:47.996 --> 18:50.085
- Fascinating.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.919
- Are we good
with the overhear?

18:57.962 --> 18:59.616
- All set.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.060
- All right, here we go.

19:09.104 --> 19:11.280
You ready to do this?

19:11.324 --> 19:13.630
- Yeah.

19:13.674 --> 19:17.895
- Cash is in the bag.
- Yeah.

19:17.939 --> 19:20.724
I just want to get
on the other side of this game.

19:20.768 --> 19:21.725
- Hmm.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.815
- And that means...

19:24.859 --> 19:26.730
I'm trusting you on this.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.648
We all got skin
in this one, Darius.

19:31.692 --> 19:33.215
Come on.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.151
- Wire's up.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.761
- Remember, they walk.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.372
The rules are different
on this one.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.764
We're building a case.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.592
We need warrants.

20:02.636 --> 20:07.118
If we don't play it right,
none of this matters.

20:07.162 --> 20:08.424
- Here we go.

20:16.737 --> 20:18.304
- It's Tyler.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.883
- Guys, I can't get a read
on the second subject.

20:32.927 --> 20:35.538
- I'm in the same boat.
Is it Jake Gibbs?

20:41.675 --> 20:44.155
- It's not Jake Gibbs.
Here.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.070
It's Lieutenant Mike Packer.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.986
- Mike Packer?

20:49.030 --> 20:51.206
- How you doing?

20:54.949 --> 20:57.821
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get this over with.

20:57.865 --> 21:00.259
I'm just here for the tan.

21:10.356 --> 21:12.488
When I get that home
and open it up,

21:12.532 --> 21:14.708
I'm not gonna find
any scag in there, right?

21:14.751 --> 21:17.537
I'm here for the quality stuff.
All right?

21:17.580 --> 21:20.191
Thunder.

21:20.235 --> 21:22.455
My name is my business.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.502
- I don't like change.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.462
This is an escalation.
This is change.

21:29.505 --> 21:32.508
- This is an opportunity.
For both of us.

21:32.552 --> 21:34.423
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But before we get there,

21:34.467 --> 21:36.033
I just want to look you
in the eyes

21:36.077 --> 21:40.037
and make sure we have
good communication.

21:40.081 --> 21:41.778
- I've been doing good business

21:41.822 --> 21:43.650
with your boys
for a long time, brother.

21:43.693 --> 21:45.216
- Hey, you don't deal
with them anymore.

21:45.260 --> 21:47.871
You want to make this kind
of product on a regular basis,

21:47.915 --> 21:50.874
you deal with me.
And I'm not your brother.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.576
And just for the record,
you don't deliver...

21:59.579 --> 22:02.321
The last thing
that comes out of that mouth

22:02.364 --> 22:05.062
is a bullet.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.890
- Message received.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.608
- We have a positive delivery.
It's done.

22:28.651 --> 22:31.872
- All right.
That's it.

22:31.915 --> 22:34.048
All right, grab the dope
from Darius.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.397
Print it.
Confirm the tracer.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.921
We got these guys
dead to rights.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.184
The best part is,
I gotta sit next to this guy

22:40.228 --> 22:42.491
at a CompStat meeting
tomorrow morning.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.322
Hey, Pack.
Hey, Johnny.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.541
- Hey.
How you been, Voight?

22:48.584 --> 22:50.107
Still out there
pounding the pavement.

22:50.151 --> 22:51.848
I can't believe it.
- Well, you do what you know.

22:51.892 --> 22:53.720
- Hey, you're gonna be
the only one awake in there.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.156
- It's why we became
cops, right?

22:55.199 --> 22:56.418
CompStat meetings.
- Yeah.

22:56.462 --> 22:58.333
- Hey, maybe this one
won't be so painful.

22:58.377 --> 23:00.770
I heard the new numbers
are pretty good.

23:00.814 --> 23:05.340
- The lowest rate of gunshot
victims in four years.

23:05.384 --> 23:09.997
Homicides, one of the biggest
drops among large cities.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.261
Now I'm gonna ask you
to dig deep.

23:13.304 --> 23:16.743
Major crime
clearance rate, 36%.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.789
And that is being generous
measured over multiple years.

23:19.833 --> 23:22.009
We've got to get
that number to 40.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.489
- Guy will do anything
to get rid of

23:23.532 --> 23:25.578
the interim part of his title.
- Mm-hmm.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.452
- Lieutenant Mike Packer

23:30.496 --> 23:32.933
sold your CI bricks of heroin?

23:32.976 --> 23:34.935
- Packer's real police, sir.

23:34.978 --> 23:36.980
- I never would have thought
in a million years--

23:37.024 --> 23:38.678
- You know that
I just promoted him?

23:38.721 --> 23:40.897
I just made him head
of the fugitive task force.

23:40.941 --> 23:44.727
We need to bury these guys
loudly and publicly.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.468
Now, before we get up there,

23:46.512 --> 23:48.470
do you know Elena Becerra
as prosecutor?

23:48.514 --> 23:49.558
- By reputation.

23:49.602 --> 23:50.820
She's tough, right?

23:50.864 --> 23:52.648
- Well, that's one way
to look at it.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.563
Doesn't take a case
she can't win, is another.

23:54.607 --> 23:56.913
But she's what we get, okay?

23:56.957 --> 24:00.047
Comes to public corruption
cases, she is the gatekeeper.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.353
She's also fiercely protective
of the police,

24:02.397 --> 24:04.617
which is normally a good thing.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.793
- Sir, all I need is
her signature on some warrants.

24:06.836 --> 24:08.272
I'll handle the rest--
- No.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.709
The minute you get in there,

24:09.752 --> 24:12.189
you make her
your equity partner.

24:12.233 --> 24:13.974
You need her buy-in, okay?

24:14.017 --> 24:16.367
Search warrants,
arrest warrants, indictments.

24:16.411 --> 24:17.978
The standard is high.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.632
We're not talking
preponderance.

24:19.675 --> 24:22.243
We're talking above
and beyond, Hank, way beyond.

24:22.286 --> 24:24.506
Okay?
- Uh-huh.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.726
- Did the tracer check out?

24:26.769 --> 24:29.163
- The narcotics Darius bought
are the same ones

24:29.206 --> 24:30.643
we checked into the vault.

24:30.686 --> 24:33.689
State Crime Lab confirmed it.

24:33.733 --> 24:36.866
- All right, well,
you did it, Hank.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.869
I mean, these cases,
they are as hard as it gets.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.392
And I know you wouldn't
have picked this,

24:41.436 --> 24:44.526
but you're there.

24:44.570 --> 24:46.528
- So let's do it.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.097
And they just had
a big payday.

24:50.140 --> 24:54.144
They're sitting on $300,000
in 1505 funds.

24:54.188 --> 24:55.581
We're ready to move.

24:55.624 --> 24:57.583
We don't want them
to take it and run.

24:57.626 --> 24:59.454
- Have a seat, gentlemen.

25:01.804 --> 25:03.893
Let me ask you something,
Sergeant Voight.

25:03.937 --> 25:05.460
- Ma'am?

25:05.504 --> 25:07.810
- What happens after
you make these arrests?

25:07.854 --> 25:10.639
- I put away three bad people.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.598
Probably have a nice scotch.
Get back to work.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.904
- Yeah, well,
that's what happens to you.

25:14.948 --> 25:17.559
What happens in the community
is a bit more complicated.

25:17.603 --> 25:19.561
Defense attorneys
will trip over themselves

25:19.605 --> 25:22.042
challenging past cases won
by these officers.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.565
And they'll succeed.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.654
You might put
three bad people away,

25:25.698 --> 25:27.569
but many more will have
their convictions overturned.

25:27.613 --> 25:28.875
They'll walk.

25:28.918 --> 25:32.095
- Yeah, well,
that's unfortunate.

25:32.139 --> 25:35.751
It's also exactly why we have
to go after guys like this.

25:35.795 --> 25:38.928
- I appreciate your passion in
this case and your hard work--

25:38.972 --> 25:41.714
- I don't need medals.
I need warrants.

25:41.757 --> 25:43.629
- Yes, you have a case.

25:43.672 --> 25:45.718
But with those stakes,
is it enough?

25:45.761 --> 25:47.415
These are TAC officers.

25:47.458 --> 25:48.808
And what you have
isn't that different

25:48.851 --> 25:52.333
from what our officers do
every day all over the city.

25:52.376 --> 25:55.597
Buy-bust, a UC flash, whatever.
Manipulate the drug market.

25:55.641 --> 25:59.601
- Okay.
Yeah, take a look at that.

25:59.645 --> 26:01.690
Look at the signature.

26:01.734 --> 26:03.779
That's confirmation
from Sergeant Gibbs

26:03.823 --> 26:06.695
that the drugs we just bought
from him were incinerated.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.523
- Which any defense attorney
worth his salt

26:08.567 --> 26:10.003
will challenge
as a paperwork error.

26:10.046 --> 26:13.267
- Yeah, well, we scrubbed
their finances too.

26:13.310 --> 26:16.618
Let me ask you something.
How many cops you know

26:16.662 --> 26:18.664
got a second home on a lake
looks like that?

26:18.707 --> 26:21.623
- Sergeant,
what you have, mostly,

26:21.667 --> 26:24.452
is the sworn testimony of a CI.

26:24.495 --> 26:25.801
That's your case.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.499
It's the most compelling stuff
you've got.

26:28.543 --> 26:30.284
But he's also a drug dealer.

26:30.327 --> 26:32.242
And he's not the first
to allege the cops are dirty.

26:32.286 --> 26:36.638
And if he's a liar, he's not
the first of those either.

26:36.682 --> 26:38.161
To move forward,

26:38.205 --> 26:41.034
I'm gonna need to know
your CI is credible.

26:44.254 --> 26:47.083
So name him.

26:47.127 --> 26:49.695
- You gotta be kidding me.
You know I can't do that.

26:53.089 --> 26:56.658
I gave him my word.
It's not gonna happen.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.879
- Hank.

26:59.922 --> 27:02.055
- Sergeant.

27:02.098 --> 27:03.578
Name him,

27:03.622 --> 27:05.885
or I cannot sign
your arrest warrants.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.806
- I came here
as a courtesy, Darius--

27:13.849 --> 27:15.459
- You want a thank you?
You hung me out to dry.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.897
- Look, if I didn't name you
as my informant,

27:17.940 --> 27:20.290
we couldn't make the case.
They wouldn't move forward.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.944
- What's that mean for me?

27:21.988 --> 27:23.467
- There's no way
of knowing that yet--

27:23.511 --> 27:24.991
- Try.

27:25.034 --> 27:27.515
- If the case goes to trial,

27:27.558 --> 27:31.301
you're gonna have to testify
in public using your name.

27:31.345 --> 27:34.304
- As a snitch.
So everyone's coming after me.

27:34.348 --> 27:38.352
- And I'm gonna do everything
I can to avoid that.

27:38.395 --> 27:43.357
Look, most of these cases, they
never even make it to trial.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.838
The State's Attorney has agreed
to push for a plea.

27:45.881 --> 27:48.710
We're gonna pit these guys
against each other, okay?

27:48.754 --> 27:51.452
Let the lawyers do their thing,
hopefully you never get called.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.236
Your name will never surface.

27:53.280 --> 27:57.327
- Hopefully.
- Hopefully.

27:59.547 --> 28:01.201
Look, the goal was
to get you out, right?

28:01.244 --> 28:03.029
It still is.

28:03.072 --> 28:05.684
Just not as pretty
as we wanted.

28:05.727 --> 28:09.078
- So I'm no longer anonymous.
And I'm not a free man.

28:09.122 --> 28:12.168
- I had no choice.
- Of course you did.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.215
You traded me for them.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.652
- Well, now you know.

28:17.696 --> 28:20.481
I wanted to tell you
face-to-face.

28:22.570 --> 28:24.093
Listen.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.968
Until the dust settles,

28:29.011 --> 28:31.492
it's probably best
you get out of town.

28:31.535 --> 28:35.583
You know, lay low.
- I guess you're right.

28:35.626 --> 28:39.413
I can't get to the other side
if I'm dead, can I?

28:39.456 --> 28:40.414
Yo.

28:44.505 --> 28:47.334
- All right, warrants are in
from the State's Attorney.

28:47.377 --> 28:49.597
Time to get this done.
- We just got ping orders too.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.642
- Get up on their cell phones.
Figure out where they are.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.035
- Yeah, I'm already
working on it.

28:53.079 --> 28:55.081
17 minutes ago,
Packer, Tyler, and Gibbs

28:55.124 --> 28:56.778
converged on the south side.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.475
- It's significant
if they're all together.

28:58.519 --> 29:00.260
Another exchange, maybe.
Something real.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.783
- Where are they?
- Off Vincennes.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.698
Hold on, it takes a second
to triangulate.

29:06.222 --> 29:07.789
86th Place.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.531
- Same spot we set up
for the heroin exchange.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.275
All right, Kim,
you stay here on the pings.

29:15.318 --> 29:17.190
Any movement from any of them,
you call me.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.408
- Copy.

29:18.452 --> 29:19.627
- Warrants against guys
like this

29:19.670 --> 29:20.802
don't stay secret
for very long.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.586
- All right, so strap up.
It's game time.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.937
Let's arrest these pricks.

29:41.562 --> 29:43.172
Psst.

29:43.216 --> 29:46.654
- Looks like he was in
a hell of a battle.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.880
- Get down!

29:56.838 --> 29:59.232
- 10-1, 10-1.
Shots fired at the police.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.887
300 block of 86th Place.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.027
- Offender down!

30:12.071 --> 30:13.333
- Who was it?

30:13.376 --> 30:15.509
- It was not one of us.
Let's move.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.735
- Let's move.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.218
- Oh, my God.

30:32.439 --> 30:34.571
- That's Gibbs.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.450
- And Tyler.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.472
- Sarge.

31:05.515 --> 31:07.604
- I got Packer.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.873
- We got another body
over here.

31:27.146 --> 31:29.757
- What the hell happened here?

31:29.800 --> 31:32.281
- Call it in.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.588
- 5021, George.
We need the Crime Lab.

31:34.631 --> 31:37.286
We got six victims.
Gunshot wounds.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.030
- An ambush.
- Had to be.

31:42.074 --> 31:44.511
We know what these cops
are capable of.

31:44.554 --> 31:47.296
- They could take on an army.
- And this was war.

31:47.340 --> 31:49.255
Semi-autos.
Extra clips.

31:49.298 --> 31:52.780
- They were lured there
and assassinated.

31:52.823 --> 31:54.956
And we know exactly
who was behind it.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.611
- That's exactly why I didn't
want to name Darius as my CI.

31:57.654 --> 32:00.048
- Come on, Hank.
It was all we had left.

32:00.092 --> 32:03.225
- You think I was just trying
to protect Darius?

32:03.269 --> 32:05.532
That's what it looks like
from behind that desk.

32:05.575 --> 32:08.100
Man, you get out there
in the muck, you'd know.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.666
I didn't want to name him

32:09.710 --> 32:11.930
because I know
what he's capable of doing.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.455
- So now what?

32:15.498 --> 32:18.284
- Now we got no good answers,
is what.

32:18.327 --> 32:19.546
I could scoop up Darius,

32:19.589 --> 32:20.982
try and connect him
to the shooting,

32:21.026 --> 32:22.723
but we got no case.

32:22.766 --> 32:24.116
And it would expose everything.

32:24.159 --> 32:27.206
- Now we got three dirty cops,
one dirty informant.

32:27.249 --> 32:30.426
You got the force pissed.
You got the community pissed.

32:36.389 --> 32:37.694
Okay.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.483
We got three cops, right?

32:43.526 --> 32:46.486
Gunned down, by thugs,

32:46.529 --> 32:51.404
for the sin of trying
to make Chicago a safer city.

32:51.447 --> 32:57.105
Packer, Tyler, and Gibbs,
they're heroes.

32:57.149 --> 32:59.064
- What about Darius Walker?

33:06.332 --> 33:08.856
- That's it?
- Yeah, that's it.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.814
- Crawford
declares them heroes?

33:10.858 --> 33:14.862
And everyone washes
their hands of it?

33:14.905 --> 33:17.473
And Darius?

33:17.517 --> 33:19.519
- Darius?

33:19.562 --> 33:21.390
They're cutting him loose.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.871
- What?
- He's a free man.

33:23.914 --> 33:25.438
- He screwed us.

33:25.481 --> 33:27.918
He screwed you.
- You got that right.

33:27.962 --> 33:30.008
- After all of this,

33:30.051 --> 33:34.708
the only winner here
is Darius Walker.

33:34.751 --> 33:37.537
- Well, there's an old saying.

33:37.580 --> 33:41.584
Some cases
are better left unsolved.

33:41.628 --> 33:45.371
- Not this one.

33:45.414 --> 33:47.068
- Yeah, this one.

33:54.771 --> 33:56.469
- So that's it?
- That's it.

33:56.512 --> 33:58.471
We're done.
You're a free man.

33:58.514 --> 34:01.256
You know, I am wondering
one thing, though.

34:05.565 --> 34:09.264
Did you even have the guts
to show up for it?

34:09.308 --> 34:12.267
- For what?
- Don't do that.

34:12.311 --> 34:16.097
When you took out
Packer, Tyler, and Gibbs,

34:16.141 --> 34:18.404
were you even there?

34:20.623 --> 34:24.062
- If you don't find a way to
beat the house once in a while,

34:24.105 --> 34:25.585
you crap out.

34:25.628 --> 34:26.847
- Hmm.

34:29.284 --> 34:33.375
Well, like I said, we're done.
You're a free man.

34:33.419 --> 34:34.985
But you should
probably understand

34:35.029 --> 34:37.727
what that means, Darius.

34:37.771 --> 34:41.079
See, what we had,

34:41.122 --> 34:45.909
it was a relationship,
a partnership.

34:45.953 --> 34:47.085
- A partnership?

34:47.128 --> 34:49.913
- Mm-hmm.

34:49.957 --> 34:52.220
- You put me here.

34:52.264 --> 34:56.137
- Bro, you put yourself here.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.966
And you got no protection now.

35:02.230 --> 35:04.102
- I survived out here
a long time

35:04.145 --> 35:05.973
before you showed up, Voight.

35:06.016 --> 35:10.195
- Yeah, that's true.
You did.

35:27.647 --> 35:29.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.787
We get an ID on the guy we
took down at the forging plant?

35:37.831 --> 35:39.485
- Yeah.

35:42.009 --> 35:43.271
Here we go.

35:43.315 --> 35:47.536
South side hustler.
One of Darius Walker's guys.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.494
- And the other two?

35:48.537 --> 35:50.017
The ones that were
already dead.

35:50.060 --> 35:51.192
We got addresses
on them, right?

35:51.236 --> 35:52.976
South side hustler turf?
- Right.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.282
They all lived
around Ogden Park.

35:54.326 --> 35:55.631
- Okay.
- Why, what's up?

35:55.675 --> 35:57.981
- Nothing.
Thanks.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.548
- All right.

36:25.226 --> 36:29.187
- No, no, no.
I just want to talk.

36:29.230 --> 36:30.927
- We don't talk to cops.

36:30.971 --> 36:32.668
- I want to talk to you about
your people that got killed.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.148
- Y'all are the ones
that killed them.

36:34.192 --> 36:35.497
- I didn't.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.412
But I know that doesn't matter.
I was there.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.024
I want to know
why they were there.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.201
Who hired them?

36:43.244 --> 36:44.332
- Why the hell you think

36:44.376 --> 36:47.335
I'm gonna help you
figure out that?

36:47.379 --> 36:49.642
- Because I think the guy
that got them killed

36:49.685 --> 36:51.034
was working with us.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.135
You following me?

37:05.179 --> 37:07.225
- What the hell
are you doing, Hailey?

37:07.268 --> 37:09.139
- Doesn't concern you.
- Yes, it does.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.620
Good or bad, right or wrong.
You know it does.

37:11.664 --> 37:13.535
- Okay.

37:13.579 --> 37:16.234
I'm investigating the murder
of three police officers.

37:16.277 --> 37:18.453
- We were told to stand down.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.063
You were given a direct order

37:20.107 --> 37:22.152
by the superintendent
of police.

37:22.196 --> 37:24.242
This could destroy
your whole career or worse.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.939
So yeah, this concerns me.

37:25.982 --> 37:28.594
- I'm gonna figure out
what the hell happened.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.335
And then I'm gonna take
that case to Crawford

37:30.378 --> 37:33.686
and he can tell me to my face
to stand down.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.775
- 20 different times,
you have figured out a way

37:35.818 --> 37:38.343
to tell me don't get too close.

37:38.386 --> 37:41.650
I'm telling you,
you're too close.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.438
- I'm okay, Jay.

37:49.005 --> 37:52.139
Go home, okay?

37:57.362 --> 38:00.190
- Hank.
- Hey, Trudy, what's up?

38:00.234 --> 38:01.714
- We got a call.

38:58.292 --> 38:59.902
- Hmm.

39:11.218 --> 39:15.004
You had to know.

39:15.048 --> 39:18.878
Ask those questions
in that neighborhood,

39:18.921 --> 39:20.488
you had to know
there's a good chance

39:20.532 --> 39:22.229
something like this
would happen.

39:28.235 --> 39:31.673
- I was just working a case.

39:31.717 --> 39:37.331
Investigating the murder
of three police officers.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.726
Someone misinterpreted
one of my statements.

39:40.769 --> 39:43.729
I can't help that.

39:43.772 --> 39:46.384
And if it worked out that a bad
thing happened to a bad person

39:46.427 --> 39:49.256
because of that
misinterpretation,

39:49.299 --> 39:50.997
well...

39:54.522 --> 39:57.003
I learned from the best.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.488
- Hailey.

40:05.577 --> 40:08.318
Want to know
what keeps me awake at night?

40:12.932 --> 40:14.412
Nothing.

40:19.634 --> 40:22.420
I do what I do because I can.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.513
Something inside me...

40:31.646 --> 40:36.434
I turned it off,
a long time ago.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.136
Hailey, you do
something like this,

40:43.179 --> 40:45.051
you don't turn that part off...

40:49.272 --> 40:52.580
It will eat you alive.

40:55.975 --> 41:01.023
- Have a little faith, Sarge.
I'll get there.

41:01.067 --> 41:03.548
- That's what I'm afraid of.
