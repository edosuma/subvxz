01:59.719 --> 02:01.550
I don't see her.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.113
The shift changes.
Just give it a couple of minutes.

02:07.927 --> 02:09.622
You guys sure about this?

02:09.662 --> 02:11.823
Yeah yeah, works all the time.

02:11.865 --> 02:15.130
Besides, this lady loves Lynch.

02:15.168 --> 02:17.466
- Loves him.
- I'm cute.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.740
Is that...
is that her?

02:29.949 --> 02:31.678
Shit.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.994
Parker, what you could do

02:44.030 --> 02:48.228
is go down there and look beautiful
and smile.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.896
- What? Me?
- Yeah.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.268
Uh, no.

02:52.305 --> 02:55.433
No no, this is your thing.

02:56.442 --> 02:59.411
All you have to do is go
over there and say, like,

02:59.445 --> 03:01.913
"Hey, me and my friends..."

03:01.948 --> 03:04.041
Girlfriends.
Say girlfriends.

03:04.083 --> 03:07.075
"Me and my girlfriends totally
forgot our credit cards

03:07.120 --> 03:09.418
so we can't get our lift tickets
from over there.

03:09.455 --> 03:12.253
- So can you, like, help us out?"
- That is so lame.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.850
- Give me my money back.
- Your money.

03:13.893 --> 03:16.361
- It's not gonna work.
- Take this. Start at 50.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.227
That's what the other
lady usually takes.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.459
And just, you know,
work your way up if you need to.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.128
- Dan...
- Hey, look at me. Look at me.

03:23.169 --> 03:25.967
You're gonna be fine.
You'll be great.

03:26.005 --> 03:27.973
Parker, you've so got this.

03:28.007 --> 03:31.204
Yeah, and what's the worst
that can happen?

03:31.244 --> 03:32.973
The guy says no.

03:33.012 --> 03:36.778
And he's not gonna say no.
No one's ever said no.

03:36.816 --> 03:38.875
Dan, you do it.
I feel stupid.

03:38.918 --> 03:42.319
Relax, okay?
I promise, you're gonna be great.

03:42.355 --> 03:45.483
- Why me?
- That's 'cause you're a girl.

03:45.525 --> 03:48.983
A beautiful...
hey, you're a beautiful girl.

03:50.163 --> 03:52.563
And you have a charming smile.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.564
Just...

03:59.839 --> 04:01.704
just...

04:02.709 --> 04:04.506
There we go.

04:08.615 --> 04:11.175
That's great.
Go get him.

04:12.986 --> 04:14.851
- Get in the game.
- Okay.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.911
Come on.

04:19.791 --> 04:22.420
Woman on P. A: Attention all skiers.
The Black Dog Trail is now open.

04:22.462 --> 04:24.794
Sorry for the inconvenience.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.135
Hey.

04:35.141 --> 04:37.837
Can I bum a smoke?

04:55.161 --> 04:58.688
- I'm Parker.
- Jason.

04:58.731 --> 05:01.029
Oh cool.
My brother's name is Jason.

05:01.067 --> 05:03.126
That's awesome.

05:03.169 --> 05:07.196
Yeah, so I don't want to waste
your time or anything

05:07.240 --> 05:10.539
because you seem like
a wicked busy guy and everything.

05:10.576 --> 05:13.477
This is gonna sound really stupid.

05:13.513 --> 05:16.141
It's just that my girlfriends and I

05:16.182 --> 05:18.150
came all the way up
from Salem State.

05:18.184 --> 05:21.210
I was kind of the dumbass
who said that I could pay

05:21.254 --> 05:23.188
for all three of the tickets
on my mom's credit card.

05:23.222 --> 05:26.919
And then I left her credit card
at the gas station.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.086
- Right.
- No, I mean...

05:29.128 --> 05:30.891
I totally have money.

05:30.930 --> 05:33.023
Just not enough for all three,
you know?

05:33.066 --> 05:35.500
- How much?
- 50?

05:36.803 --> 05:38.327
I could lose my job.

05:39.939 --> 05:41.531
No no, he's not going for it.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.668
Yes he will.
Just shut up, please.

05:44.711 --> 05:47.839
I mean he's either gonna do
that job for...

05:47.880 --> 05:49.507
what do you call it, minimal?

05:49.549 --> 05:51.016
- Minimum.
- Minimum wage,

05:51.050 --> 05:54.019
or he's gonna do it for minimum wage
plus a little bit.

05:54.053 --> 05:56.180
I mean, I know what I'd do.

06:00.893 --> 06:03.293
She just had to come
skiing today, huh?

06:05.732 --> 06:07.359
You said you wouldn't mind.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.197
I don't. I don't mind.
I don't mind at all.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.401
I'm just saying we haven't seen you
at Fezzywigs for a $1 pitcher

06:14.440 --> 06:17.136
since last semester and you don't
show up for Monday Night Football.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.406
I watched football
at your house last week.

06:19.445 --> 06:22.710
Dan, 10 minutes. Football games
are more than 10 minutes.

06:22.749 --> 06:24.444
They're like lots of 10 minuteses,
you know?

06:24.484 --> 06:26.145
I have a girlfriend now.

06:26.185 --> 06:28.380
I don't know what you want
me to do about it.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.979
- I'm sorry.
- You know what? It's fine.

06:30.022 --> 06:33.423
I'm... I'm just just saying that
Mt. Holliston was kind of our thing.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.620
And she can't even ride
so it's a little weird.

06:35.661 --> 06:38.289
- She's getting better.
- Yeah yeah.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.663
Now I feel like a dick.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.225
I mean, if you had a problem with this,
you've got to say something.

06:43.269 --> 06:46.727
No no, it's not a problem.
Just forget I said anything.

06:46.773 --> 06:48.331
I'm sorry.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.899
Woman on P. A:
Attention all skiers.

06:50.943 --> 06:53.173
Mt. Holliston will be open
next Friday through Sunday.

06:53.212 --> 06:55.942
Get your tickets now
to avoid waiting in line.

07:09.462 --> 07:11.760
Okay.

07:13.866 --> 07:16.494
I think you did great.
I'm proud of you, Parker.

07:16.536 --> 07:19.699
- I did good, right?
- You did well.

07:22.141 --> 07:24.109
So where's my change?

07:24.143 --> 07:26.111
Um, there isn't any.

07:26.145 --> 07:28.113
You just gave him the full 100?

07:28.147 --> 07:30.547
Well, yeah.
He wasn't gonna do it for 50.

07:30.583 --> 07:34.519
Okay, so what happened to
the numbers between 50 and 100?

07:34.554 --> 07:36.454
Like, say, 51

07:36.489 --> 07:38.548
or 75 even?

07:38.591 --> 07:41.685
Dan, you gave me two 50s.
Was I supposed to ask for change?

07:41.727 --> 07:44.195
I would have asked for change.

07:44.230 --> 07:46.892
I mean, it's still way cheaper
than paying for tickets, right?

07:48.434 --> 07:50.732
I definitely would have
asked for change.

07:52.572 --> 07:53.834
Hey.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.708
Girlfriends?

07:59.745 --> 08:01.474
What's up?

08:08.588 --> 08:11.648
Look at these chumps paying
top dollar for their lift tickets.

08:11.691 --> 08:14.023
- Whoo-hoo!
- Not us, though.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.358
Thanks to you, babe.

08:16.395 --> 08:20.058
Oh, now I'm babe.

08:20.099 --> 08:22.431
You never call me pet names.

08:22.468 --> 08:25.369
- I'm not a pet name guy.
- Hmm.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.202
He calls me Parker.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.039
- That's your name.
- I know.

08:31.077 --> 08:33.272
But you're supposed to
call me something affectionate

08:33.312 --> 08:35.542
like honey or sweetie.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.845
You know, I hooked up
with a girl last semester

08:37.884 --> 08:40.511
that called me my last name in bed.
It was weird.

08:40.553 --> 08:43.681
She was all like, "Oh, Lynch,
your hair's so soft.

08:43.722 --> 08:46.783
Do me harder, Lynch."
It was like throwing it to Dan over here.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.726
Yeah, I could call you O'Neil.

08:50.329 --> 08:53.856
You don't touch
my face enough either.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.629
Third wheel.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.898
- Watch it, Lynch.
- Hey, I'm not dating you.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.928
You don't get to make my life suck.

08:59.972 --> 09:02.270
- Whoa! No no no.
- Whoa.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.969
No one ever said anything

09:04.010 --> 09:06.308
about you making my life suck.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.279
- Uh-huh.
- Sweetie.

09:09.348 --> 09:11.441
Aw.

09:14.153 --> 09:16.314
So Dan tells me you're getting
a little better on that board.

09:16.355 --> 09:18.050
Well, I don't know about that.

09:18.090 --> 09:20.752
Last time I did pretty good,
didn't I?

09:20.793 --> 09:23.421
Yeah.
Yeah, you're getting better.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.157
You fall on your ass snowboarding.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.789
The first few times
you fall on your ass.

09:26.832 --> 09:29.232
After that it's easy.
It's like riding a bike.

09:33.205 --> 09:36.800
Just tell me, when are you gonna
get rid of those goddamn skis?

09:36.842 --> 09:38.639
- Come on.
- What?

09:38.678 --> 09:42.341
I mean, snowboards are just
too emo for me.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.407
Those things are a fad.
In 10 years they'll be gone.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.851
Yeah, that's what they said about rap.

09:47.887 --> 09:49.912
That's true.

09:53.125 --> 09:55.423
Can you guys smell
that fresh mountain air?

09:55.461 --> 09:57.656
It smells a bit like...

09:59.031 --> 10:00.498
cancer.

10:02.468 --> 10:05.266
You know what?
I am so sick of potheads

10:05.304 --> 10:06.862
giving me shit about smoking butts.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.807
- At least pot does something for you.
- Oh.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.003
Yes, cigarettes are just gross,
especially in the cold.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.807
They stick to you.
You smell like

10:13.846 --> 10:16.644
an ashtray,
an old man's used floss.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.776
Old man's... where the hell do you
come up with this stuff?

10:19.819 --> 10:22.344
Okay, have you ever
smelled your floss?

10:22.388 --> 10:24.856
No, I have never
smelled my own floss.

10:24.890 --> 10:27.552
- Never. Not once.
- Well, it's nasty. It is nasty.

10:27.593 --> 10:30.619
- Why am I friends with you?
- I don't know.

10:30.663 --> 10:33.029
Here, give me a drag.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.192
Do you guys know
when we're gonna get back?

10:37.236 --> 10:40.797
'Cause I've got like two weeks
worth of chapters to read.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.569
Oh come on.
She broke the first rule.

10:42.608 --> 10:45.543
- Parker, you broke the first rule.
- What?

10:45.578 --> 10:47.307
You can't talk about real life shit
while we're up here.

10:47.346 --> 10:50.577
The whole point of being here
is to forget about all that shit,

10:50.616 --> 10:52.049
- relax, enjoy ourselves.
- Okay.

10:52.084 --> 10:53.483
Deal with that shit
when you get home.

10:53.519 --> 10:56.488
Okay, but I've got...

11:03.796 --> 11:07.493
Okay, what asshole couldn't
get on the chair right?

11:07.533 --> 11:09.763
- What the hell, right?
- Dude.

11:09.802 --> 11:12.532
Oh, that's good.
Yell more.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.009
- Hello!
- Man: Having fun up there?

11:17.043 --> 11:19.238
Parker, it's okay.

11:19.278 --> 11:21.769
Is someone afraid of heights?

11:21.814 --> 11:23.839
- No.
- No?

11:23.883 --> 11:27.580
So it doesn't bother you
when I do this?

11:27.620 --> 11:30.282
- Quit it!
- Don't be an asshole.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.755
Stop.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.190
Sorry.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.853
Honey, crazy thing.

11:35.895 --> 11:38.693
Only one of these things
has ever fallen off

11:38.731 --> 11:41.393
a chairlift thing before.

11:41.434 --> 11:44.892
Okay,
points for calling me honey.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.405
But you just made that statistic up.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.807
Yeah, and statistics don't work
on smokers.

11:52.678 --> 11:54.612
Come on, man.
We paid good money to ride.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.706
Let's go!

11:56.749 --> 11:59.377
Actually, I paid good money.

11:59.418 --> 12:02.546
Actually, I'm gonna pay you back,
so it's like the same thing.

12:02.588 --> 12:04.988
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:05.024 --> 12:07.492
What, do you want it now?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.994
All right, that's what I'm talking about.

12:10.029 --> 12:12.896
Whoo!
You guys ready?

12:17.770 --> 12:20.432
- Why do I have to wear a helmet?
- Safety first.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.634
But you guys aren't wearing helmets.

12:22.675 --> 12:24.575
Only kids wear helmets.

12:24.610 --> 12:27.602
That's 'cause they're still learning,
like you.

12:27.646 --> 12:30.308
Here, I'm not arguing about this.
Just put it on. Here.

12:30.349 --> 12:32.010
No, Dan, I don't want...

12:32.051 --> 12:35.282
Look, even the pro guys wear helmets.
Nobody makes fun of them.

12:36.622 --> 12:38.647
Aw.

12:38.691 --> 12:40.750
You guys are just doing this
to make fun of me.

12:40.793 --> 12:42.090
Dan:
No, huh-uh.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.961
Parker:
Oh yeah, sure.

12:44.997 --> 12:48.592
No, I think chicks in helmets are hot.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.296
- Right?
- Yeah.

12:54.707 --> 12:57.642
- Need a little help?
- You think?

12:57.676 --> 12:59.769
Yeah, looks like your bindings
are a little loose.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.939
Come on, I'll get you up.
Come on.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.676
There you go.
I'll just tighten these up for you.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.207
- Thanks.
- No problem.

13:06.252 --> 13:08.345
Aw.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.218
Look at Lynch.

13:10.256 --> 13:13.157
Yeah, look at him.
He's a chick magnet.

13:14.393 --> 13:17.487
- These all right?
- Yeah, that's a lot better.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.294
- What the hell are you doing, man?
- Lynch: What's your problem?

13:20.332 --> 13:21.856
- I'm trying to help her.
- Ryan!

13:21.901 --> 13:25.462
- He had his hands all over you.
- No he didn't. I can take care of myself.

13:25.504 --> 13:28.530
Just go, okay?
I'll be there in a second.

13:32.378 --> 13:35.711
I am so sorry about that.
He can be such an asshole sometimes.

13:35.748 --> 13:38.046
I was seriously just trying to help.

13:38.083 --> 13:40.916
I mean, I don't know if I can compete
with a catch like that.

13:44.056 --> 13:45.990
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.993
Well, thank you for your help.

13:48.027 --> 13:50.257
I'm really sorry about that.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.196
- I'm Shannon, by the way.
- Joe.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.222
Shannon, come on.

13:54.266 --> 13:57.599
Well, it was really nice to meet you.

13:57.636 --> 14:00.503
- Yeah, you too.
- I've got to go.

14:00.539 --> 14:03.406
- Good luck with that.
- Yeah.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.347
I was like a second away
from kicking that guy's ass.

14:10.382 --> 14:13.010
Yeah, I know you were, Lynch.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.179
Don't worry about it.
He's a douchebag.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.519
Seriously, that guy was such a dick.

14:17.556 --> 14:20.525
Why don't we talk about how tough
you guys are at the bottom?

14:24.897 --> 14:27.024
I'm tough.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.727
I know you are, baby.

14:28.767 --> 14:30.394
Come here.

14:36.008 --> 14:38.568
Whoo!

14:41.247 --> 14:46.116
* How can you say there are no answers
to my questions? *

14:46.151 --> 14:51.088
* You just called once
to let it go *

14:51.123 --> 14:55.992
* How can you say that none
of this is really worth it *

14:56.028 --> 15:00.328
* When we've already won? *

15:01.333 --> 15:05.736
* When we've already won. *

15:13.112 --> 15:14.443
What?

15:31.196 --> 15:32.458
Oh, she told you that?

15:32.498 --> 15:35.365
Yeah, we'll go to Okemo, Killington.
We'll just go up north.

15:35.401 --> 15:37.266
- We'll get away for a while.
- Let's do it.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.362
- Christmas, you and me.
- Deal.

15:39.405 --> 15:43.034
Listen, it's not like out West where,
you know, it's like a commercial.

15:43.075 --> 15:45.771
You've got to ride three lifts to get to
the top, it's like perfect powder.

15:45.811 --> 15:47.301
Let's be honest,
it's not gonna be like that.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.644
Yeah, well, speaking of good skiing,

15:49.682 --> 15:52.480
riding the bunny hill
has been fun all day,

15:52.518 --> 15:56.614
but, you know, I think I'd like to do
an actual run before we leave tonight.

15:58.157 --> 16:01.058
Look, if you want to go off on your own,
you don't have to hang out with us all day.

16:01.093 --> 16:04.290
No no, it's fine. I'm just saying
I'd like to step it up at some point.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.798
You know, it's been amazing watching
Parker fall on her ass all day,

16:06.832 --> 16:09.232
but, you know, it'd be cool to...

16:09.268 --> 16:11.998
do some real skiing.

16:12.037 --> 16:15.370
I think I've had enough
skiing for today anyway.

16:15.407 --> 16:17.170
So I can just stay here at the lodge

16:17.209 --> 16:19.677
if you guys want to do more.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.010
I didn't mean that.
I didn't mean it like that.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.878
That's not what I meant.
I don't know what I meant.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.680
I told you I didn't...
I didn't have to come.

16:26.719 --> 16:29.552
No no no, Parker,
I didn't not want you to come.

16:29.588 --> 16:31.886
No, he was the one who suggested
you come in the first place.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.983
Okay okay.

16:34.026 --> 16:37.587
The last thing I want
to do is intrude on guy time.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.756
I will not be offended.

16:39.798 --> 16:41.766
I have a lot of things I can do here.

16:41.800 --> 16:45.065
Actually, why don't you give me the key
and I'll go check my messages?

16:45.104 --> 16:47.004
Not to the locker, no.
You're gonna...

16:47.039 --> 16:49.007
Come sit down for a second.
Come here.

16:49.041 --> 16:51.703
All you're gonna get is a bunch
of messages from your mom

16:51.744 --> 16:54.212
complaining about this,
complaining about that.

16:54.246 --> 16:56.680
No, I'm not gonna give you the key.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.344
I'm sorry if I ruined
skiing for you today.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.877
You didn't.
Honestly, you didn't at all.

17:02.921 --> 17:06.378
You missed the whole part of
the conversation before you walked up

17:06.425 --> 17:10.020
where I was saying, like, um...
what was I saying?

17:10.061 --> 17:11.893
I was saying, like,
"Dude, this has been really cool.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.694
I'm glad that we sort of had
this chance

17:14.733 --> 17:17.201
to bond as a threesome."

17:17.236 --> 17:20.762
What?

17:20.806 --> 17:23.741
No, I mean, I've seen you
fall a couple times today.

17:23.776 --> 17:27.405
But Dan, I mean, I think
it took him maybe three months

17:27.445 --> 17:30.438
before he could even stand on that
thing without looking like a total idiot.

17:30.482 --> 17:33.042
No offense, buddy.
Just the truth.

17:33.085 --> 17:35.246
Joe.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.222
I will catch up with you guys.

17:38.257 --> 17:40.748
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

17:41.860 --> 17:44.954
I just... I wanted to apologize again.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.897
Yeah, it's no big deal.

17:46.932 --> 17:48.490
He's just lucky
he didn't make me mad.

17:48.534 --> 17:50.058
I only look half your boyfriend's size.

17:50.102 --> 17:52.229
Ex. He's my ex-boyfriend.

17:52.271 --> 17:55.934
We're, you know, trying to
still be friends and everything.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.943
But as you can see,
it's not really gonna work out.

17:58.977 --> 18:00.569
No way.

18:00.612 --> 18:03.012
A group of us all agreed
to go skiing this weekend.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.846
Well, whatever. It's this whole story
and I don't want to hold you up.

18:05.884 --> 18:09.411
But that was just
really embarrassing

18:09.455 --> 18:11.013
and I just wanted to say sorry.

18:11.056 --> 18:12.751
That's no problem.

18:13.892 --> 18:16.656
Um, are you gonna be here
next weekend?

18:16.695 --> 18:18.185
Yeah yeah, probably.

18:18.230 --> 18:21.688
My roommate and I come up like every
Sunday, so maybe I'll see you around.

18:21.733 --> 18:24.861
That would be a nice time.

18:24.903 --> 18:28.532
- Okay.
- I guess I'll see you then.

18:28.574 --> 18:31.099
- Great. Good night.
- Good night.

18:34.179 --> 18:36.477
Come on.
You know what?

18:36.515 --> 18:38.881
Can I just get your number so I know
how to catch up with you?

18:38.917 --> 18:40.680
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

18:40.719 --> 18:42.812
Shit, I don't ski with a phone.
You have a pen?

18:42.855 --> 18:45.119
I don't ski with a pen.
Sorry.

18:45.157 --> 18:47.057
All right, you know what?
Just shoot.

18:47.092 --> 18:48.457
I've got a pretty good memory.

18:48.494 --> 18:51.292
I've only smoked pot like 500 times
so I'm good.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.895
Dan:
How can they afford to close early?

18:54.933 --> 18:56.867
You're only open three days
out of the week, man.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.233
Why don't you write a letter?

18:58.270 --> 18:59.737
Why don't you give me
my money back?

18:59.771 --> 19:01.204
What money?

19:01.240 --> 19:03.731
We're only had, like, four runs.

19:03.775 --> 19:05.538
- Can you give us a break, please?
- 830.

19:05.577 --> 19:07.204
- What?
- Just remember 830.

19:07.246 --> 19:09.714
- Just one more time, please?
- Sorry.

19:09.748 --> 19:12.717
I'd give you more money
but I gave it all to you.

19:12.751 --> 19:14.651
Hey, you got a pen?

19:14.686 --> 19:17.519
It's not about the money.
We got weather coming in.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.854
We're trying to clear the mountain.
There's nothing I can do.

19:19.892 --> 19:23.658
Okay, what if we run straight down?
Like the quickest run ever?

19:25.797 --> 19:27.822
We'll be, like, wicked fast.

19:27.866 --> 19:30.426
We gave you 100 bucks.

19:30.469 --> 19:32.937
Come on.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.373
Please?

19:41.480 --> 19:44.040
- Hurry.
- Like I said, wicked fast.

19:44.082 --> 19:46.676
- Like the wind.
- 7860.

19:59.064 --> 20:01.692
Seriously, for 100 bucks you'd figure
the guy would cut us some slack.

20:01.733 --> 20:03.223
No shit.

20:03.268 --> 20:05.429
I thought they were open
till 10:00 on Sundays.

20:05.470 --> 20:08.200
What ever happened
to night skiing?

20:08.240 --> 20:11.141
Wachusett's got night skiing.
Should have gone there.

20:11.176 --> 20:13.872
It's kind of like Quash Hill,
just not as lame.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.877
Do you remember
the numbers I told you?

20:16.915 --> 20:19.110
830.

20:19.151 --> 20:21.619
Look at you, Lynch.
You got her number.

20:21.653 --> 20:23.382
What did He-Man
have to say about that?

20:23.422 --> 20:25.720
That guy? Who cares?
Steroids shrink your dick.

20:25.757 --> 20:28.248
Oh shit, what are my numbers?

20:28.293 --> 20:30.386
7860.

20:30.429 --> 20:33.057
Parker, will you
remember that, 7860?

20:33.098 --> 20:35.498
Nope.

20:37.636 --> 20:40.662
- Early night, huh?
- Yeah.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.333
Pendergraph wants to see you
in his office.

20:42.374 --> 20:44.274
Something about the schedule
next weekend.

20:44.309 --> 20:47.073
- I'm not working next weekend.
- Well, that's what you thought.

20:47.112 --> 20:49.410
Come on, Rifkin,
it's my brother's bachelor party.

20:49.448 --> 20:51.143
I put in for it two months ago.

20:51.183 --> 20:53.777
Go talk to the boss.
He's packing up.

20:53.819 --> 20:56.253
I'm the best man.

20:57.623 --> 20:58.920
Ready to shut down?

20:58.957 --> 21:02.415
There's three more on the way down.
Wait for them and it's all set.

21:06.632 --> 21:09.100
I am not waiting till we get back
to campus to eat.

21:09.134 --> 21:10.692
I am starving.

21:10.736 --> 21:13.034
Why didn't you just eat
some of that pizza?

21:13.071 --> 21:15.801
Oh, you mean the cardboard
with tomato sauce you guys ate?

21:15.841 --> 21:17.968
That's not pizza.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.138
That's like roller-skating-rink-
birthday-party pizza. No.

21:21.179 --> 21:24.945
There's a Papa Gino's in the way back.
It's like 15 minutes down the mountain.

21:24.983 --> 21:26.678
Sweet.

21:26.718 --> 21:29.949
I may eat a whole real pizza
myself, thank you.

21:30.989 --> 21:32.957
Dan:
Whoa, look at those guys.

21:32.991 --> 21:35.118
We are definitely hitting
that jump this time.

21:35.160 --> 21:37.390
Last run, got to make it count.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.827
Hey, Sullivan, hey.

21:42.868 --> 21:45.632
Hey, man, do me a solid.
I've got to take a piss so bad I can taste it.

21:45.671 --> 21:48.333
- What? What?
- I'll just be gone for two minutes.

21:50.509 --> 21:52.977
Asshole.

21:58.583 --> 22:02.075
- Jesus.
- It's just the wind, Parker.

22:02.120 --> 22:05.021
Don't you mean baby?

22:24.443 --> 22:26.502
Man on radio:
Last chair is through.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.513
All set down here.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.606
Man on radio:
Let's go home.

22:40.225 --> 22:42.523
Oh, come on.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.971
It's freakin' cold up here!

22:54.005 --> 22:56.439
We don't have time for this.
Thank you.

23:06.852 --> 23:09.286
Anyone know any good jokes?

23:09.321 --> 23:11.551
Uh...

23:13.024 --> 23:15.390
what did the 14-year-old girl
from New Hampshire

23:15.427 --> 23:17.258
say to her dad
when she lost her virginity?

23:17.295 --> 23:19.820
Get off me,
you're crushing my Marlboros.

23:20.832 --> 23:22.129
Yup.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.076
What do you think the worst
way to die would be?

23:36.114 --> 23:38.582
That's not morbid.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.745
Yeah, seriously,
that's kind of spooky, Dan.

23:41.787 --> 23:45.120
See, I think being eaten by a shark,

23:45.157 --> 23:47.421
that would be the worst way to go.

23:47.459 --> 23:50.917
Not like one of those surfers
who gets attacked from below.

23:50.962 --> 23:53.260
You know, never sees it coming.

23:53.298 --> 23:56.597
Like the poster for "Jaws."

23:56.635 --> 23:58.193
The chick on the "Jaws"
poster was hot.

23:58.236 --> 23:59.828
She was?

23:59.871 --> 24:03.102
I don't know. She was naked
and naked chicks are hot.

24:03.141 --> 24:07.635
What if you actually saw
the fin coming towards you?

24:09.314 --> 24:11.373
That'd be worse than being eaten,
I think.

24:11.416 --> 24:14.317
I mean, knowing this giant animal
is coming at you

24:14.352 --> 24:17.014
and it's gonna eat you alive.

24:19.424 --> 24:21.892
Did you ever see the video,
by the way,

24:21.927 --> 24:25.624
of that great white that's jumping out
of the water and eating the seal?

24:25.664 --> 24:28.064
Yeah, that's why I only swim in pools.

24:30.001 --> 24:32.231
I think burning would be
the worst way to go.

24:32.270 --> 24:34.636
Well, yes and no.

24:34.673 --> 24:37.540
I mean, most people die of smoke
inhalation before fire even touches them.

24:37.576 --> 24:39.840
It's a fact.

24:39.878 --> 24:43.211
I remember watching TV
for three days straight

24:43.248 --> 24:45.478
after 9/11.

24:45.517 --> 24:49.146
The footage they showed of those
people leaping off the Trade Center.

24:51.022 --> 24:53.820
Can you imagine how bad
it must have been inside

24:53.859 --> 24:56.692
to know that jumping would have
been the better way out?

24:59.264 --> 25:01.926
Yeah, but they say that when you jump
from that height your heart stops.

25:02.934 --> 25:04.663
You don't feel it
when you hit the ground.

25:04.703 --> 25:07.228
Okay then, Lynch,
what is the worst way to die?

25:07.272 --> 25:09.103
- What?
- Oh no no no.

25:09.140 --> 25:13.042
You have an answer for everything.
What is your biggest fear?

25:13.078 --> 25:15.911
That's easy.
The sarlacc pit.

25:17.148 --> 25:19.480
I'm sorry, the what?

25:20.485 --> 25:22.510
The sarlacc pit
from "Return of the Jedi."

25:22.554 --> 25:26.251
Uh, hello. Being slowly digested
over 1000 years...

25:26.291 --> 25:29.124
worst death ever.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.391
"Dan, why don't I ever
have a girlfriend?

25:32.430 --> 25:33.795
Why?"

25:33.832 --> 25:36.392
Hey, shut up.

25:41.406 --> 25:43.704
Why hasn't the chair started again?

25:43.742 --> 25:46.040
Just give it a minute.

25:46.077 --> 25:48.136
This is nothing, man.

25:48.179 --> 25:50.545
At Stowe last year,
me and Sullet

25:50.582 --> 25:53.415
were stranded for like 25 minutes.

25:53.451 --> 25:57.080
This big chick fell at the top
and twisted her leg, you know?

25:57.122 --> 26:00.057
And I was like, fine, people.
Just hoist her off to the side.

26:00.091 --> 26:02.924
Keep the line moving.
But no, they had to stop,

26:02.961 --> 26:05.225
celebrate it right there.
We all had to stay on the lift

26:05.263 --> 26:07.231
and freeze our asses off.

26:07.265 --> 26:10.325
Honestly, by the end of it I couldn't
feel my fingers.

26:12.037 --> 26:15.063
What? Come on.

26:15.106 --> 26:16.733
Oh, come on now.

26:16.775 --> 26:18.766
Man, this is so messed up.

26:20.612 --> 26:23.080
- Are you kidding me?
- Dan.

26:23.114 --> 26:26.174
I kind of just shat my pants a little bit.
I'm not gonna lie.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.585
Hey!

26:30.622 --> 26:32.749
Turn the goddamn lights on!

26:35.560 --> 26:38.757
They forgot that we're up here.
No one knows we're up here.

26:38.797 --> 26:40.594
They didn't forget
that we're up here, okay?

26:40.632 --> 26:42.691
There's cameras all over the place.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.134
- Hello!
- Hey!

26:45.170 --> 26:48.435
Assholes, start the chair!
We're freezing!

26:49.641 --> 26:52.337
Oh my God.
What if they can't get the chair moving?

26:52.377 --> 26:54.436
What if... what if everyone went home?

26:54.479 --> 26:56.947
Hey hey, you know what you need to do?
You need to stop, okay?

26:56.982 --> 26:59.041
You're just scaring the shit out of me.

26:59.084 --> 27:03.020
By the way, remind me to knock
the shit out of that chairlift guy.

27:03.054 --> 27:04.783
What exactly did you say to him?

27:04.823 --> 27:07.053
What? Nothing.
I didn't say anything to him.

27:07.092 --> 27:09.788
Well, you clearly pissed him off
enough to do this.

27:09.828 --> 27:11.125
Look, he knows we're up here.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.653
Then why are the lights off, Dan?

27:13.698 --> 27:15.029
Is that part of their policy?

27:15.066 --> 27:16.795
Turn off the lights
and scare the customers?

27:16.835 --> 27:18.826
I don't know.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.304
Maybe it's a power outage
or something, okay?

27:21.339 --> 27:23.330
That stuff happens all the time.

27:23.375 --> 27:26.367
They didn't go home.
That's retarded.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.081
This is so messed up.

27:36.388 --> 27:39.516
I mean, worst-case scenario

27:39.557 --> 27:41.684
they send up a ladder
or something, right?

27:49.034 --> 27:51.502
Worst case I could just jump.

27:52.637 --> 27:54.832
I've done that before.

27:54.873 --> 27:57.341
It's not so bad.

28:04.616 --> 28:07.676
We have to get off these chairs.
We can't stay up in this chair.

28:07.719 --> 28:09.744
Why isn't the goddamn chair
moving, Dan?

28:09.788 --> 28:13.246
You acting all psycho is not gonna
make the chair move along, okay?

28:14.893 --> 28:16.520
All right?

28:19.330 --> 28:22.424
Please don't yell at me.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.298
I didn't mean to yell.

28:27.105 --> 28:29.369
This shit happens
all the time though, okay?

28:29.407 --> 28:32.934
I mean, they can't just leave
people up on chairs.

28:32.977 --> 28:35.707
You know the kind of lawsuit
that they would have?

28:35.747 --> 28:37.715
What other people?

28:39.117 --> 28:41.312
There wasn't anybody
in front of us.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.283
They're not gonna leave us
up here all night.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.723
That's all I'm saying.

28:47.759 --> 28:49.226
It's Sunday.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.626
It's fucking Sunday

28:51.663 --> 28:53.631
and they're not open again till Friday.

28:53.665 --> 28:56.463
We're gonna be stuck
here all week.

28:56.501 --> 28:58.731
Oh God.

28:58.770 --> 29:01.432
We're not gonna
be stuck up here.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.907
Parker.
Parker, look at me.

29:03.942 --> 29:07.002
Come on, there is no way a ski resort
would let that happen,

29:07.045 --> 29:09.411
no matter how shitty
they are, okay?

29:28.199 --> 29:30.190
Hello!

29:30.235 --> 29:33.261
Somebody help us, please!

29:33.304 --> 29:36.501
- Somebody! Hello!
- Hey hey hey.

29:36.541 --> 29:38.600
- Come on, it's all right.
- Somebody!

29:38.643 --> 29:40.338
Shh.
Come on, it's okay.

29:40.378 --> 29:42.346
They're gonna turn
the power on in a minute.

29:42.380 --> 29:46.043
We're all gonna be
laughing about this. Seriously.

29:48.887 --> 29:50.855
I have to pee.

29:54.993 --> 29:56.483
I have to pee wicked bad.

29:56.528 --> 29:58.462
Yeah, that makes two of us.

29:58.496 --> 30:00.464
Ew, Lynch.

30:00.498 --> 30:03.160
If you pull your junk out
in front of me, I might puke.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.998
Well, what do you want me to do?
I've got to go.

30:07.238 --> 30:09.138
How am I supposed to go?

30:09.174 --> 30:11.870
I don't know. Just, you know,
lift this up and bend down.

30:11.910 --> 30:14.572
Are you crazy?
Put the bar down.

30:14.612 --> 30:16.876
It's just a safety bar, okay?
It doesn't really do anything.

30:16.915 --> 30:21.249
Well, I like the safety bar and I like it
down where it's supposed to be.

30:21.286 --> 30:22.719
Well, how are you gonna piss?

30:25.256 --> 30:28.555
- I can hold it.
- For a week?

30:33.097 --> 30:36.430
What? She's the one saying
we're gonna be here for a week.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.172
I can hold it.

30:43.408 --> 30:44.841
Well, I can't.
I'm pissing.

30:44.876 --> 30:48.004
Ew, that is so gross, Lynch.

30:48.046 --> 30:50.344
Well, too bad, okay?

30:51.716 --> 30:53.684
Make me wait up here

30:53.718 --> 30:56.016
in this below freezing weather...

30:57.922 --> 31:00.686
while I wait for this Fisher-Price
lift to work.

31:00.725 --> 31:02.522
Ah.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.960
Oh shit.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.228
Hey!
We're up here!

31:37.262 --> 31:39.287
Hello!

31:39.330 --> 31:41.662
- Somebody help us!
- Somebody!

31:41.699 --> 31:43.564
- Put the bar down, Joe.
- Help!

31:43.601 --> 31:46.092
Put the goddamn bar down, Joe!

31:47.939 --> 31:49.964
God, it feels like a needle.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.937
Hey!
Hey!

32:28.980 --> 32:31.608
What did I tell you guys?

32:31.649 --> 32:34.174
Hello!

32:34.218 --> 32:37.187
- Hey!
- Hey, we're over here!

32:37.221 --> 32:39.689
Whoo-hoo!

32:43.061 --> 32:45.291
Up here!

32:45.330 --> 32:48.458
- Whoo-hoo!
- Help us!

32:48.499 --> 32:51.195
Help us!

32:51.235 --> 32:52.998
Man on radio:
Cody, this is base.

32:55.373 --> 32:58.467
Why is he stopping?

32:58.509 --> 33:01.205
He's gonna help us.
He sees us.

33:01.245 --> 33:02.507
Go for Cody.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.811
Hey man, where you at?

33:06.017 --> 33:08.315
I'm cutting over to Pinewood
to pick up Barnes.

33:08.353 --> 33:11.322
No, man, Barnes just landed.
The mountain is clear.

33:11.356 --> 33:13.722
Come back to base so we can
get the hell out of here.

33:13.758 --> 33:17.717
Copy that.

33:18.896 --> 33:21.922
Hey, where are you going?

33:21.966 --> 33:24.526
- Hey! Hey!
- Where's he going?

33:27.572 --> 33:30.234
- What is he doing?
- Where is he going?

33:30.274 --> 33:33.004
- Up here!
- We're up here!

33:38.483 --> 33:40.713
- Hey!
- Come on.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.617
Up here.

33:46.157 --> 33:48.057
Hey!

33:49.927 --> 33:53.590
- Hey!
- Please don't leave us!

33:53.631 --> 33:56.930
- Look up!
- No!

33:56.968 --> 34:00.267
- Come back! Stop!
- Hey!

34:00.304 --> 34:03.967
Stop! Stop!

34:07.979 --> 34:10.072
Hey, come back!

34:15.253 --> 34:17.619
Parker:
Come back. We're here.

34:17.655 --> 34:21.216
No. No.

34:41.379 --> 34:44.177
My face is burning.

34:44.215 --> 34:45.681
Power's coming back on.

34:45.716 --> 34:48.583
- No it isn't.
- It has to.

34:48.619 --> 34:51.588
Does anybody know what time it is?

34:51.621 --> 34:55.023
Hold on. Let me just
run back to the locker.

34:55.059 --> 34:57.152
I'll check my phone real quick.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.994
Okay,

35:02.033 --> 35:04.263
top three breakfast cereals
of all time.

35:04.302 --> 35:06.327
Go.

35:06.370 --> 35:08.099
Okay, I'll go first.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.664
Uh, Crunch Berries.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.438
- Parker: Stop.
- Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

35:13.478 --> 35:15.105
Please stop.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.977
And I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

35:17.014 --> 35:19.448
Lucky Charms
pre purple horseshoes.

35:19.484 --> 35:22.351
Is it just me or is it really weird

35:22.386 --> 35:24.786
eating purple horseshoes?

35:28.359 --> 35:30.554
Everybody went home.

35:30.595 --> 35:33.291
They left us up here.

35:35.533 --> 35:38.661
Top three celebrities you'd do.
Go.

35:39.737 --> 35:41.534
Somebody needs to jump.

35:43.841 --> 35:46.674
If we're up here all week
we're gonna die.

35:54.519 --> 35:56.714
Hey. Shh.

35:56.754 --> 35:59.188
Hey.

35:59.223 --> 36:01.487
Shh shh.

36:01.526 --> 36:04.324
- It's okay.
- I don't want to die up here, Dan.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.331
No no no.
Hey, you're not gonna die.

36:07.365 --> 36:11.096
I promise I won't let you die.

36:12.703 --> 36:14.933
Okay?

36:16.574 --> 36:19.065
I'm so...

36:19.110 --> 36:21.738
I'm so scared.

36:21.779 --> 36:24.612
Yeah, me too.

36:28.052 --> 36:30.680
Oh my God.

36:32.723 --> 36:34.554
Hey, guys.

36:36.460 --> 36:40.362
What was the best Christmas
present you guys ever got?

36:41.465 --> 36:43.695
Shaina my puppy.

36:43.734 --> 36:46.362
Hey, Dan?

36:46.404 --> 36:48.372
No? Okay.

36:48.406 --> 36:50.567
I guess it's my turn.

36:51.576 --> 36:54.704
My skis.
You get it?

36:56.080 --> 36:58.810
- Oh shit.
- Oh! Shit.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.716
Hey. Hey.

37:05.756 --> 37:08.657
Look at me.
Look at me.

37:08.693 --> 37:10.786
Look at me. Look at me.

37:10.828 --> 37:13.058
Your face is...

37:13.097 --> 37:16.294
it's really red.
I think you got frostbite.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.428
Lynch:
No, you can't get frostbite that fast.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.665
We've only been up here, what?

37:21.706 --> 37:24.937
I mean, it's only been
a few hours tops.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.069
- What are you doing?
- I'm jumping.

37:27.111 --> 37:28.908
- No you're not.
- Yes I am.

37:28.946 --> 37:31.244
Even if I hurt myself
I can get myself down

37:31.282 --> 37:33.682
and I can get us some help.

37:33.718 --> 37:34.946
It's too far, man.
You can't jump.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.954
- Do you have a better idea?
- Than jumping?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.580
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I got a better idea.

37:38.623 --> 37:40.853
We can wait till the morning.
I mean, someone's gonna come.

37:40.891 --> 37:42.256
A groomer or some shit.

37:42.293 --> 37:44.284
They're gonna groom the mountain
when it's closed, huh?

37:44.328 --> 37:46.592
When it's not gonna be open
for another five days.

37:46.631 --> 37:49.156
- Dan, don't leave me.
- I can do this.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.770
All right, Joe's gonna
be here with you, okay?

37:53.804 --> 37:56.466
All right?
He'll take care of you.

37:56.507 --> 37:58.134
No, man, don't do this.
Walker, don't.

37:58.175 --> 38:01.338
Dan, don't leave me.
Please.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.711
Look at me.
Look at me.

38:05.916 --> 38:09.943
You're gonna be okay, baby.
You're gonna be okay.

38:17.828 --> 38:20.023
- Dan, no.
- Don't do this, man.

38:26.904 --> 38:30.362
Remember that thing I said
about having done this before?

38:31.876 --> 38:34.344
I totally lied.
I'm scared shitless.

39:01.539 --> 39:03.700
Dan! Danny!

39:03.741 --> 39:06.266
Dan, are you okay? Say something!

39:06.310 --> 39:09.108
Oh my God.

39:10.114 --> 39:11.547
Oh my God!

39:11.582 --> 39:14.346
Danny!
Talk to me, Danny!

39:14.385 --> 39:16.910
Oh my God.

39:16.954 --> 39:19.252
- Oh my God, my legs.
- Dan!

39:19.290 --> 39:23.556
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

39:23.594 --> 39:25.858
My legs are broken!
Oh my God!

39:25.896 --> 39:28.057
Can you move, Dan?

39:28.099 --> 39:30.431
No, I can't.
I can't move.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.231
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, baby.

39:32.269 --> 39:34.362
- What are you doing?
- I've got to get down to him.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.872
Stop, you're gonna get hurt.
Calm down.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.136
No no no, stay there.

39:38.175 --> 39:40.575
Don't get off the chair.
Stay on the chair.

39:40.611 --> 39:44.103
- How bad is it?
- It's bad.

39:44.148 --> 39:45.809
It's really bad.

39:45.850 --> 39:49.286
The bone is sticking out of my leg.
Help!

39:49.320 --> 39:51.447
Help!

39:51.489 --> 39:53.480
Please help!

39:53.524 --> 39:55.389
Hey, Dan, buddy.

39:55.426 --> 39:56.984
Dan, can you move at all?

39:57.027 --> 39:59.495
No, man, it's bad.

39:59.530 --> 40:01.725
You can't slide down the hill
or anything?

40:01.766 --> 40:05.065
No, I can't slide down the fucking hill!
I'm bleeding to death, man!

40:05.102 --> 40:07.002
Okay okay.

40:07.037 --> 40:08.971
Can you stop the bleeding?

40:09.006 --> 40:11.941
- With what?
- Hold on.

40:17.047 --> 40:18.480
Here.

40:20.484 --> 40:21.951
Shit!

40:21.986 --> 40:23.510
Hey, Dan, hold on, man.

40:23.554 --> 40:26.250
Hold on.
I'm gonna throw mine down to you.

40:26.290 --> 40:29.418
Here it comes.
Ready?

40:31.028 --> 40:32.586
Can you get to it?

40:33.631 --> 40:35.599
Just feel for it, buddy.

41:10.401 --> 41:12.961
I got it.
I got it.

41:13.003 --> 41:17.804
Okay, Dan, you're gonna have to
tie that to your legs.

41:17.842 --> 41:20.037
Tie it onto your legs
above where it's bleeding.

41:20.077 --> 41:22.807
Okay?
Like a tourniquet thing.

41:32.189 --> 41:35.590
Okay, hold on. Wait.
Here, take my coat.

41:35.626 --> 41:39.221
No, leave your coat on.
Don't take your coat off.

41:39.263 --> 41:41.163
It's okay.
I can huddle next to Lynch.

41:41.198 --> 41:43.063
- Please.
- Leave your coat on!

41:53.277 --> 41:55.507
Fuck!

42:03.120 --> 42:05.918
- Hey. Hey, Dan.
- What?

42:05.956 --> 42:08.220
Maybe I can climb up to the cable

42:08.259 --> 42:10.523
and get to a chair
that's closer to the ground.

42:10.561 --> 42:13.553
You've got to be careful, man.
Those cables are razor sharp.

42:13.597 --> 42:16.122
You think you can pull yourself
across on these chairs?

42:17.334 --> 42:18.562
I can't even do a pull-up.

42:18.602 --> 42:20.433
You never even tried
to do a fucking pull-up.

42:20.471 --> 42:24.202
Your mom had to write you a letter
so you could get out of gym class.

42:26.143 --> 42:28.304
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah?

42:28.345 --> 42:30.973
Remember Jenny Bluth?
Huh?

42:31.015 --> 42:33.540
Remember her?
She could do a fucking pull-up.

42:33.584 --> 42:35.279
I know, but...

42:35.319 --> 42:38.777
even if I get to that chair,
how many more chairs is it gonna take

42:38.822 --> 42:40.255
before I get to one
that's closer to the ground?

42:42.259 --> 42:43.886
The poles.

42:43.928 --> 42:45.828
The poles, they all have
ladders on them, okay?

42:45.863 --> 42:47.228
The lift poles.

42:47.264 --> 42:48.993
You just have to find
your way to one of those.

42:49.033 --> 42:51.001
Okay.

42:51.035 --> 42:54.766
Okay, how far is that chair
away from the pole?

42:54.805 --> 42:57.603
- I don't know.
- Just give me a second.

42:57.641 --> 43:00.075
Give me a second, all right?

43:00.110 --> 43:02.510
Wait, what if you fall too?

43:02.546 --> 43:06.004
Parker, if we stay up here we're gonna
freeze to death and he's gonna die.

43:08.319 --> 43:11.288
Okay, Dan.
Dan, I'm gonna try and scale back

43:11.322 --> 43:13.415
to the next chair.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.757
Baby.

43:17.795 --> 43:20.025
Baby, was that you?

43:20.064 --> 43:23.591
- What?
- Hey, shut up, Dan. Shut up.

43:25.469 --> 43:27.801
Oh my God.

43:27.838 --> 43:30.864
Oh my God.
That was a wolf.

43:30.908 --> 43:33.274
Dan, that's not a wolf, man.
That's a coyote or something.

43:33.310 --> 43:35.540
I know the sound of a fucking wolf!

43:35.579 --> 43:37.945
- Help!
- They're scared of people.

43:37.982 --> 43:40.450
- Help me!
- Come on, relax.

43:40.484 --> 43:42.884
When was the last time you heard
of a wolf attack in New England?

43:42.920 --> 43:46.014
Never.
They're pussies, man.

43:46.056 --> 43:48.490
The wolves around here,
they're not even that big.

43:50.894 --> 43:54.728
Hey. Hey, listen.
It could be worse, right?

43:54.765 --> 43:56.232
How could it be worse?

43:59.169 --> 44:01.296
It could be the sarlacc pit.

44:01.338 --> 44:05.069
Hey, Parker came through
with the tension breaker, bud.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.475
Your girl's all right, Walker.

44:07.511 --> 44:10.480
- Hey, she's all right.
- Just climb.

44:10.514 --> 44:12.982
Please, please just climb.

44:13.017 --> 44:16.248
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, I'm coming.

44:20.391 --> 44:22.154
Hold on.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.820
It'll be okay, Dan.

44:27.798 --> 44:31.063
You know it's funny, I was never
afraid of heights until right now.

44:31.101 --> 44:33.399
- Okay, what can I do to help?
- I don't know.

44:33.437 --> 44:35.405
Just hold on to my legs.

44:35.439 --> 44:37.930
I mean, you can't stop me
from falling but it's...

44:37.975 --> 44:39.943
it's like psychological or something.

44:39.977 --> 44:42.502
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:44.314 --> 44:46.441
Oh shit, it's high.
It's really fucking high.

44:46.483 --> 44:49.680
- What can I do to help?
- Nothing. Just stop talking, okay?

44:49.720 --> 44:51.688
- Okay.
- Okay.

44:51.722 --> 44:54.213
Come on.

45:00.230 --> 45:02.095
Please hurry!

45:02.132 --> 45:04.362
Dan, just be quiet, okay?

45:08.105 --> 45:09.800
Oh God.

45:11.775 --> 45:13.766
Shit, it's all ice.

45:13.811 --> 45:17.212
Hey, Dan.
Dan, buddy, it's all ice.

45:17.247 --> 45:20.148
But I think if we knock it off
I can get to the top.

45:21.585 --> 45:23.416
Hold on.

45:25.823 --> 45:27.381
Shit.

45:43.807 --> 45:46.708
Oh shit.

45:47.711 --> 45:49.941
What am I supposed to do?

45:53.817 --> 45:56.285
You guys!

45:56.320 --> 45:58.185
What the fuck
am I supposed to do?

46:01.158 --> 46:03.023
Get the hell away from him!

46:12.569 --> 46:14.537
Hey.
Hey, are you all right?

46:14.571 --> 46:16.664
Yeah.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.800
Yeah, I'm alive.

46:20.377 --> 46:22.311
See, I told you, man.

46:22.346 --> 46:25.611
They're more afraid of you
than you are of them. Huh?

46:25.649 --> 46:28.550
I don't know, man.
I'm pretty afraid.

46:28.585 --> 46:30.382
I know, man.
I know.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.014
I can't feel my legs anymore.

46:33.056 --> 46:36.355
That's not good, right?

46:36.393 --> 46:39.453
I mean, they don't hurt as bad,

46:39.496 --> 46:41.623
but that's not good.

46:41.665 --> 46:44.065
No no, it's fine.
You're gonna be all right.

46:44.101 --> 46:46.501
Okay, it's probably
really really bad.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.471
We're got to move and get...

46:48.505 --> 46:51.030
Hey hey hey.
Go like this.

46:51.074 --> 46:53.565
Ow.
Ow, it's like a sunburn.

46:53.610 --> 46:56.010
- No no, I think it's frostbite.
- What?

46:56.046 --> 46:57.809
Is my face changing color anywhere?

46:58.949 --> 47:01.383
I don't know.
I can't see anything.

47:01.418 --> 47:03.318
Don't... don't touch it.
Stop.

47:03.353 --> 47:05.321
- Stop.
- But it itches now.

47:05.355 --> 47:07.220
I know, but if you rub your face
it's gonna come off.

47:07.257 --> 47:08.519
Will you just hurry up up there?!

47:08.559 --> 47:10.823
Okay, I'm trying.
Hold on.

47:10.861 --> 47:12.692
Shit.

47:28.378 --> 47:29.709
Be careful.

47:29.746 --> 47:32.613
Okay, just don't talk.

47:35.919 --> 47:38.217
I can do this.

47:44.228 --> 47:46.128
Oh, I got you.

47:46.163 --> 47:47.687
Shit, it's slippery.

47:48.932 --> 47:51.093
Don't look down.

47:56.240 --> 47:58.367
My boots are so heavy.

48:13.357 --> 48:16.417
The cable is cutting
through my gloves.

48:19.596 --> 48:21.723
Do you got it?

48:30.474 --> 48:31.907
Oh, my hands.

48:36.480 --> 48:38.505
Oh my God.

48:38.548 --> 48:40.675
What?
What's wrong?

48:40.717 --> 48:43.151
Oh my God.
Okay.

48:44.688 --> 48:47.316
What is it? What?

48:48.792 --> 48:50.783
I got you.
I got you, you're okay.

48:50.827 --> 48:52.818
I got you.

48:52.863 --> 48:55.354
You're okay.

48:55.399 --> 48:57.094
What's wrong?

48:57.134 --> 48:58.601
- What's wrong?
- Don't look down.

48:58.635 --> 49:00.728
- What?
- Don't look. Don't look.

49:01.738 --> 49:03.262
- Lynch.
- Yeah, man?

49:03.307 --> 49:05.935
Don't you let her look.

49:05.976 --> 49:08.444
- Don't you fucking let her look.
- Dan!

49:08.478 --> 49:10.878
- Shh.
- Dan!

49:10.914 --> 49:13.212
No, I won't, man.

49:13.250 --> 49:15.115
Don't.

49:15.152 --> 49:17.882
Don't you let her look!

49:17.921 --> 49:21.152
Dan!

49:26.229 --> 49:28.561
Let me look.
I need to look.

49:28.598 --> 49:31.123
I need to look!

49:31.168 --> 49:33.295
No!

49:35.172 --> 49:37.970
No! Dan!

49:38.008 --> 49:40.533
Let me look!

49:44.715 --> 49:47.912
- No!
- Oh my God. Oh my God.

49:47.951 --> 49:51.148
Oh my God.

49:53.357 --> 49:55.848
Oh God.
Think about Dan.

50:01.698 --> 50:03.495
Shh shh.

50:03.533 --> 50:06.093
Don't listen to it.
Just don't listen to it.

50:06.136 --> 50:08.229
Don't listen to it.

50:15.312 --> 50:17.837
Okay. Okay.

50:17.881 --> 50:20.679
Okay.

50:38.468 --> 50:40.766
Dan!

50:47.911 --> 50:49.879
No, Dan.

50:54.985 --> 50:57.283
No!

51:25.348 --> 51:27.475
Cables cut through my gloves.

51:27.517 --> 51:29.678
My hands are wasted.

51:30.687 --> 51:32.484
Why'd you let him jump?

51:36.693 --> 51:39.127
You can't be serious.

51:40.130 --> 51:41.620
It was too far.

51:43.633 --> 51:45.692
No, he said he could do it.

51:45.735 --> 51:48.101
You didn't try to stop him.

51:53.176 --> 51:55.974
I can't believe this.
Are you trying to blame me?

51:56.012 --> 51:57.946
No.

51:57.981 --> 51:59.539
No, I'm not blaming you.

51:59.583 --> 52:01.050
I mean, you're his girlfriend.

52:01.084 --> 52:03.484
I didn't see you trying to throw
yourself in front of him.

52:03.520 --> 52:05.852
He wasn't going to listen to me.

52:05.889 --> 52:07.618
But he would have listened to me?

52:09.593 --> 52:11.720
No, I said it was a bad idea.

52:11.761 --> 52:13.490
I said it was too far a drop.

52:13.530 --> 52:15.964
I didn't hear any ideas from you
except for crying about it.

52:18.101 --> 52:20.126
Don't you fucking blame me.

52:22.405 --> 52:24.999
You've been his girlfriend for what,
a year?

52:25.041 --> 52:26.872
Maybe?

52:30.614 --> 52:33.640
I've known him
my entire fucking life.

52:34.851 --> 52:36.546
You should've...

52:36.586 --> 52:38.713
- you should've...
- What?

52:40.957 --> 52:42.982
Say it!

52:45.061 --> 52:47.086
It should've been me.

52:47.130 --> 52:49.530
- No.
- That's what you want to say.

52:49.566 --> 52:51.830
No, that's...
that's not what I said.

52:51.868 --> 52:54.701
It's okay. I get it.
I get it.

52:54.738 --> 52:56.729
It should have been me
down there, right?

52:56.773 --> 52:58.172
'Cause who gives a fuck about me?

52:58.208 --> 53:00.199
No.

53:01.545 --> 53:03.103
You know what?

53:03.146 --> 53:05.546
If we hadn't spent the entire day
on the fucking bunny hill

53:05.582 --> 53:07.516
watching you fall on your ass

53:07.551 --> 53:09.519
we would have done some runs
and we could have gone home.

53:09.553 --> 53:11.680
I'm sorry.

53:13.390 --> 53:16.257
Or maybe if you hadn't
fucked with our thing.

53:16.293 --> 53:18.523
Maybe if you had just stayed home

53:18.562 --> 53:20.689
and not tried to force yourself

53:20.730 --> 53:22.789
into every little aspect of his life

53:22.832 --> 53:24.925
my best friend
wouldn't be dead right now.

53:24.968 --> 53:27.368
That's...

53:27.404 --> 53:29.201
not fair.

53:29.239 --> 53:31.139
That's not fair.

53:33.810 --> 53:36.574
It's not fair
that my best friend is dead.

53:38.481 --> 53:40.915
He's not coming back.
He's gone.

53:44.921 --> 53:48.049
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you!

54:09.212 --> 54:11.077
I'm sorry.

54:14.551 --> 54:16.485
I'm sorry.

54:16.519 --> 54:19.511
I'm so sorry, Lynch.

54:20.957 --> 54:22.948
Please.

54:31.067 --> 54:33.126
I'm sorry.

54:34.137 --> 54:37.698
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it.

54:44.314 --> 54:47.306
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it, okay?

54:47.350 --> 54:49.784
I didn't mean it.

55:05.669 --> 55:07.500
Parker: 830.

55:08.872 --> 55:10.806
Oh shit.

55:10.840 --> 55:13.331
What were my numbers?

55:13.376 --> 55:16.504
- 786...
- 7860.

55:17.681 --> 55:20.479
830-7860.

55:20.517 --> 55:22.508
Yeah.

55:22.552 --> 55:25.248
I'm so gonna call that girl
when I get back.

55:25.288 --> 55:27.552
You know what?

55:27.590 --> 55:30.354
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
No messing around.

55:30.393 --> 55:32.520
I'm just gonna call her and I'm gonna
be like, "Hey, Shannon.

55:32.562 --> 55:35.258
It's Joe from the chairlift.
Will you marry me?"

55:35.298 --> 55:37.425
We'll get a house,
have two kids

55:37.467 --> 55:39.162
and a dog named Steve.

55:39.202 --> 55:42.399
- Who's gonna pay for the house?
- She will.

55:42.439 --> 55:44.566
She's got a great job.

55:44.607 --> 55:46.507
What does she do?

55:46.543 --> 55:49.103
Orthodontist.

55:49.145 --> 55:51.545
Orthodontists make a lot of money.

55:51.581 --> 55:53.412
Yeah.

55:53.450 --> 55:57.011
Well, I'm sure the two of you
will be really happy.

55:58.388 --> 56:01.619
830-7860.

56:03.760 --> 56:05.421
Who names their dog Steve?

56:05.462 --> 56:07.726
I will.

56:08.998 --> 56:11.193
Steve's a people name.

56:11.234 --> 56:13.464
Says who?

56:16.172 --> 56:18.299
You don't, like,
go to someone's house

56:18.341 --> 56:21.970
and have them say,
"Here, meet my dog Steve."

56:23.012 --> 56:25.572
Why not?
I think Steve's a good name for a dog.

56:25.615 --> 56:27.947
Here, meet my cat Chris.

56:27.984 --> 56:30.714
No cat.

56:30.754 --> 56:33.814
Just a dog...
Steve.

56:37.193 --> 56:39.718
Shaina must be so hungry.

56:43.266 --> 56:44.824
What kind of pizza should we get?

56:44.868 --> 56:46.426
The poor thing.

56:48.338 --> 56:51.102
She's just a puppy.

56:52.475 --> 56:56.172
She's not gonna understand
that I died.

56:58.281 --> 57:00.806
She's gonna think that I left,

57:00.850 --> 57:02.818
that I forgot about her.

57:03.953 --> 57:06.581
She's probably waiting

57:06.623 --> 57:09.023
by the front door right now.

57:09.058 --> 57:12.789
At every little noise
that she hears

57:12.829 --> 57:14.296
in the hallway,

57:14.330 --> 57:17.595
she's probably
cocking her little head

57:17.634 --> 57:19.829
to the side

57:19.869 --> 57:22.497
wondering when
I'm gonna come in.

57:22.539 --> 57:25.133
But I won't.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.473
I won't come in.

57:27.510 --> 57:30.638
And she's gonna...
she's gonna starve to death.

57:34.083 --> 57:36.017
She's gonna starve to death

57:36.052 --> 57:39.647
waiting for me to come in.

57:39.689 --> 57:41.987
It's all my fault.

57:42.025 --> 57:44.823
She's not gonna starve to death.

57:44.861 --> 57:47.557
You're not gonna die, Parker.

57:48.565 --> 57:51.966
I'm the only one with a key
to my apartment, though.

57:52.001 --> 57:54.526
Yeah, I know, but the neighbors
will kick the door down

57:54.571 --> 57:57.472
if she doesn't stop barking.

57:57.507 --> 57:59.907
Someone will figure it out.

57:59.943 --> 58:02.309
She'll be just fine.

58:04.214 --> 58:06.205
So will you.

58:06.249 --> 58:08.809
So will we.

58:17.293 --> 58:19.158
I just want to see my mom.

58:22.031 --> 58:23.896
And my dad.

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:11.692
Ah!

01:01:18.374 --> 01:01:21.070
I thought I was dreaming.

01:01:21.110 --> 01:01:24.011
I thought I was dreaming this.

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:35.749
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

01:01:37.126 --> 01:01:38.991
Your frostbite is getting worse.

01:01:39.996 --> 01:01:42.624
- Really? How bad...
- Don't touch it. It's bad.

01:01:45.234 --> 01:01:47.065
It doesn't itch as much anymore.

01:01:47.103 --> 01:01:49.537
Okay, don't touch your face though.

01:01:51.974 --> 01:01:53.703
When we get out of here
I'm gonna get you to a doctor.

01:01:53.743 --> 01:01:56.303
- They'll fix it right away.
- You have...

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.973
You have red marks on your face too.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.443
They'll fix me up too.

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:08.489
Don't. Don't.
Don't touch it. It's bad.

01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.753
Well, it's the morning.

01:02:16.766 --> 01:02:18.631
Maybe someone will come up now.

01:02:18.668 --> 01:02:20.761
For what?

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:24.967
Mountain maintenance.
I don't know.

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.836
Besides, if we don't show up for class
people will start looking for us.

01:02:29.879 --> 01:02:31.904
No one knows we're here.

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.746
I didn't tell anyone
I was coming.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:39.588
Help!

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:42.614
We need help!

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:53.661
If I can get to that pole
I can climb down the ladder.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:00.508
How are you gonna climb
with your hands like that?

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.342
We won't make it another night.

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:06.644
Are you sure you don't want to...

01:03:06.682 --> 01:03:09.014
wait a few hours?

01:03:09.051 --> 01:03:11.042
I mean, maybe you're right.

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:13.954
Maybe someone's coming in today.

01:05:38.134 --> 01:05:40.694
The sun feels good.

01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:44.263
First we're freezing,
now we're gonna get sunburned.

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:46.673
Be careful what you wish for, right?

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:49.303
How come you
never have a girlfriend?

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:52.439
How am I supposed to answer that?

01:05:52.481 --> 01:05:55.109
I just mean you're a decent guy.

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:57.381
And chicks dig you.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:00.116
But you never
have a relationship.

01:06:02.024 --> 01:06:03.958
I had a serious girlfriend once.

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.553
- High school doesn't count.
- No.

01:06:06.595 --> 01:06:08.893
No, post high school.
Freshman year.

01:06:08.931 --> 01:06:10.831
Who?

01:06:10.866 --> 01:06:13.664
This girl Annie.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:17.195
We met at freshman orientation.

01:06:17.239 --> 01:06:19.833
We emailed each other
during the summer.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:22.673
When we got back to school
it was like we were dating.

01:06:22.712 --> 01:06:24.202
Oh.

01:06:24.246 --> 01:06:27.374
I just really felt it
with her, you know?

01:06:27.416 --> 01:06:29.907
We were into the same stuff,
which was cool.

01:06:29.952 --> 01:06:32.182
She was way into Aerosmith.

01:06:32.221 --> 01:06:34.382
I'd seen 'em five times.
She'd seem 'em eight.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.857
What happened?

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.686
She, uh...

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:46.231
had the same favorite
movie as me... ET.

01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:50.337
It was like soulmates,
that shit you read about.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:57.344
So what happened?

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:00.244
Same old shit.

01:07:00.282 --> 01:07:02.512
No.

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:05.076
You know what happened?
She...

01:07:05.121 --> 01:07:06.952
she liked another guy.

01:07:08.591 --> 01:07:13.221
This fraternity douchebag
named Dean.

01:07:14.563 --> 01:07:17.031
She dumped you for a frat guy?

01:07:17.066 --> 01:07:18.863
No.

01:07:18.901 --> 01:07:21.096
No, I dumped her.

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.367
We were in the cafeteria, right?

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.636
You know, we were having lunch,
facing each other.

01:07:25.674 --> 01:07:29.201
I was facing the wall and she was
facing everybody behind me.

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.907
And I kept seeing her, like,

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:37.748
you know, looking at somebody.
You know, like kind of laughing.

01:07:37.787 --> 01:07:39.652
And I was just like,
you know,

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:41.588
"What's so funny?"
You know?

01:07:41.624 --> 01:07:43.819
And, you know, like,
"What the hell is going on?"

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.383
And she said...

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.832
she said,
"Dean's making fun of you."

01:07:51.867 --> 01:07:55.769
So I turn around and I'm ready to
just beat the shit out of this guy.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:00.575
But all I can see are these
random fucking people.

01:08:00.609 --> 01:08:02.736
All these faces.

01:08:02.778 --> 01:08:06.578
This guy was making eyes
at my girl and could see me

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:09.584
but I couldn't see him.

01:08:12.988 --> 01:08:15.286
That's messed up.

01:08:17.292 --> 01:08:19.420
I never felt so stupid.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:23.292
I just walked out.

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.200
You just walked out?

01:08:26.234 --> 01:08:28.260
Yeah, I told her to laugh it up
with Dean the frat guy.

01:08:28.304 --> 01:08:29.999
I was out.

01:08:30.038 --> 01:08:32.506
That sucks.

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:37.675
Maybe I shouldn't have been
so quick to walk away.

01:08:37.712 --> 01:08:40.613
You know, maybe I should
have had a thicker skin

01:08:40.649 --> 01:08:42.640
and not been
such a sensitive bitch.

01:08:49.225 --> 01:08:52.524
Sometimes I feel like
I was just insecure.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.654
Maybe I screwed up.

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:59.861
You should tell her that.

01:08:59.902 --> 01:09:02.962
When you get home
you should call her.

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:07.470
I can't.

01:09:11.180 --> 01:09:13.205
She's dating Dean.

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:25.587
I should have done something.

01:09:29.365 --> 01:09:30.854
There was nothing
you could have done.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:34.426
I just sat here
and I let him die.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:37.166
No, you didn't.
We didn't let him die, okay?

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.867
There was nothing
we could have done.

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.536
He jumped down there
to save us, okay?

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.009
He was the one.

01:09:47.049 --> 01:09:49.950
He was the boy
I was gonna marry.

01:09:52.621 --> 01:09:54.748
Hey.

01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:56.951
First grade

01:09:56.992 --> 01:10:00.359
and we get left there
by our moms

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:01.761
for the day.

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.697
It's like the first
real day of school,

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.359
you know,
without your folks around.

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:09.303
And Dan was this chubby little kid.

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:11.363
No, fuck it.

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:14.399
He was a fat ass.

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:17.037
And so our moms all leave

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:19.206
but Dan wouldn't let go
of his mom's hand.

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:23.116
And even after she left he just stood
at the front of the class

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.245
crying like a total pussy.

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:28.051
- That sounds like Dan.
- Yeah, you have no idea.

01:10:29.625 --> 01:10:32.093
Anyway, so the teacher...

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:34.891
oh, what's her name?

01:10:38.801 --> 01:10:40.496
Mrs. Schifrin.

01:10:40.536 --> 01:10:44.233
So Mrs. Schifrin is trying everything
to get the fat kid to stop crying.

01:10:44.273 --> 01:10:46.901
And she says,

01:10:46.942 --> 01:10:49.240
"You know,
maybe there's somebody...

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.405
somebody else
you know in the class.

01:10:51.447 --> 01:10:53.438
Maybe you have a friend
you want to sit with."

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:58.914
And this little fucker points
right at me and says, "Him."

01:10:58.954 --> 01:11:01.855
Now I've never seen
this kid in my life.

01:11:03.292 --> 01:11:06.693
But for some reason
he pointed at me.

01:11:08.197 --> 01:11:10.495
- So you had to sit with him?
- Yeah, for a whole week.

01:11:10.532 --> 01:11:13.763
Whole first week of school I had to share
my little cubby with his fat ass.

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:15.963
Oh, gosh.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.369
He was a douchebag.
I never let him forget it.

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:42.219
Dan didn't die up here just for you
and I to give up and die too.

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.205
Help me up.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:15.656
Are you okay?

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:22.697
Oh God!

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:24.501
Oh shit.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:27.703
- Shit, just hold on.
- Oh my God.

01:12:27.743 --> 01:12:30.610
- The chair is gonna fall.
- No it's not. No it's not.

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:33.672
Oh, God.

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:38.677
My hands.

01:12:47.463 --> 01:12:49.590
Oh God, my hands.

01:13:35.043 --> 01:13:36.169
Joe!

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:50.959
Fuck you, Jenny Bluth.

01:13:52.127 --> 01:13:54.755
Oh fuck.

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:06.632
Oh shit.
Shit.

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.200
- Hey, Parker.
- What?

01:14:09.244 --> 01:14:12.111
I need you to throw my extra pole
as far as you can this way.

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:14.138
What?

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:16.777
I said I want you
to throw my ski pole

01:14:16.819 --> 01:14:19.447
as far down the hill as you can.

01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.854
I'm gonna need some defense
when I get on the ground.

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:23.983
Okay.

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:55.657
Okay.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:06.431
Oh my God.

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:11.933
- Shit.
- I'm sorry.

01:15:11.974 --> 01:15:15.068
It's okay.

01:15:23.819 --> 01:15:26.447
Shit.
Oh shit.

01:15:28.557 --> 01:15:30.081
Okay.

01:15:30.125 --> 01:15:31.683
You can do it.

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:34.355
You can do it.
Please do it.

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:11.588
Please don't break.
Please don't break.

01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.304
Shit.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.085
I just want to go.
Please let me go.

01:16:55.510 --> 01:16:58.138
You did it!
You did it!

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.489
- Oh shit.
- Joe!

01:17:08.523 --> 01:17:10.354
Lynch!

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:14.027
- Lynch!
- I'm okay.

01:17:39.755 --> 01:17:41.586
No! No!

01:17:55.437 --> 01:17:57.564
No!

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:13.747
Stay the fuck back!

01:18:18.326 --> 01:18:20.385
Try and stay still.

01:18:24.399 --> 01:18:26.594
I'll be back as fast as I can.

01:18:26.635 --> 01:18:29.035
Please please hurry.
Please.

01:18:31.406 --> 01:18:34.432
Joe, look out!

01:18:39.281 --> 01:18:41.943
Joe!

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:02.847
Aw, Joe...

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:12.019
Ow!

01:26:14.402 --> 01:26:16.427
Hello!

01:26:22.210 --> 01:26:24.201
Help, please!

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:26.179
Wait!

01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:35.078
Hey, you okay?

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.674
Hello?

01:27:36.718 --> 01:27:38.583
Hey, you all right?

01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.248
Hold on.
Hold on.

01:27:41.289 --> 01:27:42.688
Hold on.

01:27:42.724 --> 01:27:44.749
I'm gonna get you help.

01:27:47.562 --> 01:27:49.462
No, there were no other cars.

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:53.263
I found her laying in the road
right outside of Mt. Holliston.

01:27:56.471 --> 01:27:58.769
I'm taking her to you now.

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:02.306
Hold on.

01:28:02.343 --> 01:28:04.538
The hospital
is only 10 minutes away.

01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:07.845
You're gonna be okay.

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:10.112
You're gonna
be okay.

01:28:11.419 --> 01:28:13.614
You're gonna be okay, baby.

01:28:15.823 --> 01:28:18.018
You're gonna be okay.
