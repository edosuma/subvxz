How'd you like to open a show
for me in a couple of weeks?

00:13.305 --> 00:17.059

‐In the comedy capital
of Sacramento.

dating anyone right now.

Yeah, well, you moved out fast.

01:51.111 --> 01:53.322

a third of the rent
when money's tight.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.199
‐So you did it for me?
‐I need a new roommate.

01:56.199 --> 01:58.493
‐Why?
‐Because I might get fired.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.746
And I need someone that can
actually pay half the rent.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.331

02:03.290 --> 02:04.041
Well thanks.

someone who was looking.

one line and they cut it.

of her money modeling.

Well, I hope you got
some good references.

‐Down here.

‐Are you okay?
‐Yes.

10:40.348 --> 10:42.600
I problem solve better
on my back.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.855
Maybe if we refresh
the client more often,

10:46.855 --> 10:48.773
that'll ensure any database
updates are reflected?

10:48.773 --> 10:50.942
Yes, but that doesn't solve
the issue as to why

10:50.942 --> 10:53.111
arbitrary responses
aren't being received.

‐Ordering dinner.

So, problem.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.548

11:55.548 --> 11:57.133
DB is missing receipts too.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.594
Then it would be a client

‐Can't open it.

12:02.055 --> 12:03.181

12:03.181 --> 12:05.225

you switched your connection.

12:05.225 --> 12:07.227
Where do we go through
offline requests?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.063
Uh... should be in
the network listener.

12:10.063 --> 12:13.983
So if the listener is
also making a request
to the send controller...

12:15.318 --> 12:16.486
It's a race condition.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.529
The controller is clearing
the cached requests

12:18.529 --> 12:19.781

has gone through them.

22:15.292 --> 22:17.044
But! I'd be coming to
Sacramento to see you.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.089
I haven't seen your stand‐up
and I really need to get away.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.549
It's been really stressful
at work.

22:22.216 --> 22:23.592
Dental cleanings
are stressful?

22:23.592 --> 22:24.927
Have you ever spent
eight hours a day

22:24.927 --> 22:26.387
with your hands
in other people's mouths?

22:27.638 --> 22:30.891
Well, remember when we went
through that experimental phase?

22:30.891 --> 22:32.017
No! I guess I haven't!

22:32.017 --> 22:34.436
Look. I won't cross
any lines with Lindsay.

22:34.436 --> 22:35.896
Okay? I promise.

‐Great.

I'll wait in the car.

I'm there. I promise!

‐Who's it gonna be...

22:54.748 --> 22:55.875
‐Sumi: Me. Me.
‐It's you, Sumi.

Absolutely. For sure.

have come clean with Joey.

Now Sumi knows
what Lindsay thinks
about Joey.

23:03.048 --> 23:04.675
And God knows she
can't keep a secret.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.051
It's like a ticking time bomb.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.678

after what you said earlier.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.246
Yeah, just,
I didn't wanna say it
just because you said it.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.789
Of course. Yeah.

You should say it

If you wanna say it.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.754
Well it's not that I don't

the moment's right for saying.

disappointed you were

from your drive.
‐Uh, I flew.

comfortable around you.

Wow. That's ironic.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.277
Joey.
Glad you could make it.

24:47.277 --> 24:49.071
Why don't we all
grab dinner before the show?

24:49.071 --> 24:50.614
I think we're gonna eat
at the hotel.

‐Order room service.
‐There's no room service.

Dinner sounds great.

Alright then.
Let's do it.

Restaurant here
is pretty good.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.251
And, uh, all our meals
are comped.

25:02.251 --> 25:03.585
Hey, even better.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.593
Sumi!
You forgot your purse.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.262
I left it at the hotel.

25:13.262 --> 25:14.430
It wasn't there when we left.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.933
You two go grab a table.
I'll help her find it.

25:19.435 --> 25:20.811
Go. Go.

25:20.811 --> 25:22.479
I'm one punch away
from a free fro‐yo.

25:22.479 --> 25:23.814
I need that bag, Alice.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.190
Where do you think it is?

25:26.108 --> 25:27.693
Back at the hotel.
I lied.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.069
I needed to talk to you alone.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.113
Okay. I know Lindsay has been
flirting with me,

25:31.113 --> 25:33.323
but don't worry.
I'm not flirting back.

25:33.323 --> 25:35.743
Really? 'Cause you're
practically sitting
on their face.

25:36.201 --> 25:38.037
I don't appreciate
that kind of talk.

25:38.037 --> 25:40.080
It's not about Lindsay.
It's about Joey.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.874
Oh, now you think
I'm flirting with Joey?

25:41.874 --> 25:44.501
No. You can't tell Joey
that Lindsay thinks

25:44.501 --> 25:46.336
they're the one broke up
their relationship with Jenny

25:46.336 --> 25:48.130
because Joey thinks
Lindsay's the one

25:48.130 --> 25:49.715
that broke up their
relationship with Jenny.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.427
This Jenny sounds like
a piece of work.

25:54.094 --> 25:55.679
Yeah, I'm pretty sure you two
have nothing in common.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.723
Look, do you understand
what I'm saying?

25:57.723 --> 26:00.225
They both have
opposite points of view
of what happened

26:00.225 --> 26:01.435
and I don't want drama
before the show.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.520
Okay, okay!
I get it. Geez...

26:04.396 --> 26:05.731
(sighs)
Okay. Let's go.

26:05.731 --> 26:06.940
I don't want them alone
for too long.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.942
‐What about my purse!
‐It's at the hotel!

26:10.110 --> 26:11.236
Oh, right. Yeah.

26:20.704 --> 26:24.083
So, Marcus told me about
your conflict of interest.

26:24.917 --> 26:26.960
I thought I warned you
about dating another lawyer.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.796
Too late.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.965
So what did Marcus say to you?

26:31.965 --> 26:35.677
Um. He said that
there'd be other cases.

26:36.386 --> 26:38.013
And no one would blame me

26:38.013 --> 26:39.973
for stepping away
for personal reasons.

26:40.682 --> 26:41.600
Of course he did.

26:43.018 --> 26:44.019
This is my point.

26:44.561 --> 26:47.189
If you were a man,
he never would have
offered you an out.

26:47.981 --> 26:50.359
Because it wouldn't occur to him
that a man would or should

26:50.359 --> 26:52.319
put a relationship
before his career.

26:55.572 --> 26:58.909
Look, I have a friend who's
trying a case in New York

26:58.909 --> 27:00.702
and she's looking
for someone to house sit.

27:01.662 --> 27:04.665
She's got a really nice
two‐bedroom place in Echo Park
with a city view.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.044
All you'd have to do
is water the plants
and take care of the place.

27:13.090 --> 27:15.717
So are we meat eaters,
vegetarians...

27:16.468 --> 27:17.469
Joey and Lindsay:
Vegan.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.014
Oh. You two have
so much in common!

27:22.307 --> 27:25.185

27:25.894 --> 27:26.854
Okay, sorry!

27:26.854 --> 27:28.564

Hey! Okay, so, um...

27:29.565 --> 27:31.400
Why are we
speaking Chinese?

27:31.733 --> 27:33.068
Oh. Are we?

27:33.610 --> 27:35.153
Sometimes we slip into it.

to your pronouns and diet.

27:42.244 --> 27:43.871

27:51.169 --> 27:54.548
Okay, I think we should discuss
the elephant in the room.

These chips are subpar.

Isn't one of the reasons

so you could have
a quiet place to study?

30:02.634 --> 30:05.387

Yes. But obviously
I'm team you

It would have just made
you mad and then I would've
had to choose a side.

I would never make you
