01:15.868 --> 01:18.953
Money, success, fame, glamour

01:19.037 --> 01:23.082
Has either been discredited or destroyed

01:23.167 --> 01:26.836
Money, success, fame, glamour...

01:27.379 --> 01:29.839
- Let me ask you a question, E.
- I'd rather you didn't.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.425
Do you think it was a good idea
to bang Sloan's ex-mother

01:32.509 --> 01:34.886
even if there was only a slight chance
you would want Sloan back?

01:34.970 --> 01:37.472
- That answer would be a no.
- It's like when they killed off

01:37.556 --> 01:39.098
Brandon Walsh from 90210,

01:39.183 --> 01:40.641
destroying any chance of a movie.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.769
They didn't kill off
Brandon Walsh in 90210.

01:42.853 --> 01:43.811
- They didn't?
- No.

01:43.896 --> 01:45.104
Then why didn't
they make a movie?

01:45.189 --> 01:46.814
Probably because nobody
would have gone to see it.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.775
- I would have gone to see it.
- Yeah, me too.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.151
Anyway, let's get
back to the point.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.487
- No, let's not.
- What were you thinking?

01:52.571 --> 01:56.282
- She was Sloan's mother, dude!
- And now she's a client.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.993
VINCE: Hey, there's my motherfucker.

01:59.661 --> 02:02.163
- Get it?
- Oh, I get it. Hilarious.

02:02.706 --> 02:05.124
- I don't get it.
- "Motherfucker. "

02:05.417 --> 02:08.877
- E fucked the mother.
- Oh, you mean stepmotherfucker.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.838
I get it, I get it.
That's funny, bro.

02:10.923 --> 02:12.590
- How are you holding up?
I feel strong.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.842
This picket line will not give.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.761
- ERIC: How goes it here?
- It goes great.

02:16.845 --> 02:18.763
Did you really need
the cheerleading squad though?

02:18.847 --> 02:21.891
- Raphael, give me a minute?
- I have to change the lights anyway.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.645
So do tell, E.
Any word from CBS on Johnny's movie?

02:25.729 --> 02:27.980
Moonves liked the script.
He's gonna think about it.

02:28.065 --> 02:29.982
Hey well, there's a start. Should I call him?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.943
- I'll let you know if you need to.
- Okay.

02:32.528 --> 02:34.654
- Anyone else need anything?
- I'm all good.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.656
Got my peeps
from Don Peppe's flying in today,

02:36.740 --> 02:39.283
- gonna find us a place to make magic.
- You paid to bring them out?

02:39.368 --> 02:42.537
First class the whole way,
Beverly Hills hotel suite, Laker tix.

02:42.621 --> 02:45.331
- I told him to take it slow.
These guys are culinary masters.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.833
I've got to show them
I'm not fucking around.

02:46.959 --> 02:49.502
- Sounds like a man with a plan.
- Don't knock him, Shauna.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.587
He did it with AviÃ³n,
and I'm here to help.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.631
Thank you, Vin,
but I don't want your help.

02:53.882 --> 02:56.175
- Either way.
- Vince, let's do this.

02:56.260 --> 02:58.302
Okay.
This guy's amazing.

02:58.387 --> 03:01.013
- He did the Culo book for Interscope.
- The one with the sick asses?

03:01.723 --> 03:03.850
Yeah, he's good.
Hey, bro, maybe he could shoot me, huh?

03:03.934 --> 03:06.644
Maybe he'll put your face
in the next "sick asses" book, Drama.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.896
So funny I forgot to laugh.

03:08.981 --> 03:11.023
So is Vince gonna get
the cover or what, Shauna?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.359
That's the hope.
Let's see what they think of the article.

03:13.443 --> 03:14.861
When will we get to see
what we think of the article?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.028
Could be any second.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.406
- Are you worried?
- I'm not. The interview went great.

03:18.490 --> 03:20.992
Sophia loved me.
In fact, you all go about your day

03:21.076 --> 03:23.077
- and when it comes in I'll call you.
- Are you sure?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.037
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- I'm on strike, bro.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.331
- I got nothing else to do.
- Go with E.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.292
- I do want to focus.
- All right.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.669
- We'll check with you later, Vin.
- All right, good luck, Turtle.

03:31.753 --> 03:34.297
- Thanks.
- You are worried!

03:34.381 --> 03:37.216
- I'm curious.
- You know what? It just came in on my Berry.

03:37.301 --> 03:39.802
- Now I'm worried.
- Let me get it printed, okay?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.305
Raphael, I'm gonna
need another 1 0.

03:43.473 --> 03:45.182
What's the worst
that could happen?

03:45.267 --> 03:47.435
In your case, your wife
files for full custody of the children.

03:47.519 --> 03:49.687
- She would never!
- Ari.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.439
You know my wife.
She would never.

03:51.523 --> 03:53.524
Hey, I've known
a lot of wives, including my own,

03:53.609 --> 03:55.443
and when things get ugly,
all bets are off.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.737
You know my wife actually
spit at me in court?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.197
She did.
When the judge asked her if it was true

04:00.282 --> 04:01.949
because he hadn't seen it,
she offered to do it again.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.619
I won't let this get ugly.
I'm gonna offer her whatever she wants.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.412
- No, you can't do that.
- Why not?

04:06.496 --> 04:08.956
The first thing
I advise in a divorce is to give in nothing

04:09.041 --> 04:12.001
because then when you want to give
something, you've got nothing left to give.

04:12.085 --> 04:14.003
I don't want this
to be contentious, Jim.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.755
- When someone is hurt...
- She's not hurt, I'm hurt.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.841
- She wants this.
- Maybe she does.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.843
Maybe she thinks you forced her into it.
I don't know.

04:20.928 --> 04:24.096
Either way, let her attorney and me deal with
each other. You have no contact at all,

04:24.181 --> 04:25.890
except about the kids.

04:25.974 --> 04:28.768
What is she entitled to financially?

04:29.061 --> 04:31.354
Half your earnings for life.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.650
- Even though she's the rich one?
- Even though.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.693
And the money she
put in the business, how much was that?

04:38.528 --> 04:41.113
- Almost 1 1 million.
- You're gonna have to return that to her.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.616
Separate and apart
from anything else, that money is hers.

04:43.700 --> 04:44.867
I don't have it right now.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.953
You're gonna have
to sell your piece of the company.

04:47.037 --> 04:49.413
- Are you joking?
- Major League Baseball took over the Dodgers

04:49.498 --> 04:51.666
during an ugly divorce.
Why do you think you would be any different?

04:51.750 --> 04:54.585
- So she can take my kids and my business?
- She can try to take your kids.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.587
It's almost impossible
for her to win full custody.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.422
As far as your business,
it's almost impossible,

04:58.507 --> 05:00.132
if you don't get her that money,
for you to keep it.

05:01.093 --> 05:02.885
Maybe this is going to get ugly.

05:04.388 --> 05:05.429
Breathe, buddy.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.556
This is only
the entrance point.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.892
- The entrance point to what?
- To hell.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.356
Hey, hey, why aren't you
returning Melinda Clarke's phone calls?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.400
- Who says I'm not returning her calls?
- She says.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.151
She called me five times.
"Why isn't Eric calling me back?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.654
- "Why isn't Eric calling me back?" Five times!
- I'm gonna call her back.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.531
I mean, you know she got
the J.J. Abrams show?

05:23.615 --> 05:25.491
- Are you serious?
- Pick up the phone!

05:25.575 --> 05:28.452
- All right, I'm gonna call her.
- E, Melinda Clarke again.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.205
Tell her I'll call her back.

05:31.289 --> 05:34.125
What the fuck is going on, huh?

05:34.876 --> 05:36.669
What the fuck is going on?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.754
It's Walsh.
I wonder how he's holding up.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.549
- Billy.
- You selfish, greedy,

05:41.633 --> 05:43.175
money-hungry cocksucker.

05:43.260 --> 05:45.386
- Hey, take it easy, Billy.
- Don't tell me to take it easy.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.556
You told me this little
strike of yours would last 24 hours or less.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.600
Trust me, Billy,
it'll all be over soon. We just can't panic.

05:51.727 --> 05:55.438
I have a mortgage, five kids
and no maple syrup, Drama.

05:55.731 --> 05:56.731
No maple syrup?

05:56.815 --> 05:59.442
Maya, baby, what did I tell you
at breakfast this morning?

05:59.651 --> 06:02.611
Daddy says we can't
afford maple syrup.

06:03.572 --> 06:06.490
I can't lose this job, Drama. I need the money.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.368
You're not gonna lose the job.
The talent has all the power.

06:09.453 --> 06:13.080
My check didn't come this morning, Drama.
My check that I need.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.959
Phil said all payments to everyone are
frozen until they make a decision.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.545
- A decision on what?
- On what they're gonna do with my show!

06:19.713 --> 06:21.255
- They'll cave.
- They better

06:21.339 --> 06:23.257
or I'll cave your fucking face in.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.468
You cost me this job
and I'll kill you.

06:25.552 --> 06:28.679
I don't mean figuratively.
I'll literally gut you like a salmon steak.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.598
- Do you hear me?
- Daddy, Daddy!

06:30.682 --> 06:31.849
- I gotta go.
- Billy...

06:31.933 --> 06:36.187
All right, everybody!
Who's ready to kill this piÃ±ata?

06:36.271 --> 06:38.606
Get it, get it!

06:42.652 --> 06:44.570
They're not giving
Billy his paycheck.

06:44.654 --> 06:47.031
- That's not good.
- Maybe we should call Phil.

06:47.157 --> 06:50.326
You can't, you're on strike. You can't call the
power people. It shows weakness.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.119
You don't believe
in this strike, do you, E?

06:52.204 --> 06:53.621
No, I never did, Drama.
I told you that.

06:53.705 --> 06:56.373
But you said there was no show without Dice
and you were gonna stay strong.

06:56.458 --> 06:58.417
Billy panicked me.
I'm weakening.

06:59.169 --> 07:00.211
You wanna cross the line?

07:01.338 --> 07:02.338
No.

07:03.048 --> 07:04.924
I want to hit the gym,
bulk up.

07:05.801 --> 07:06.926
Good move.

07:07.511 --> 07:10.262
- There's something very strange.
- What's that?

07:10.347 --> 07:14.934
Well, there's a $300,000 SLS
in the parking lot with a cute red bow on it.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.936
- Oh yeah, whose?
- It's yours.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.688
- Gift from Melinda.
- Hmm.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.529
Call Melinda.
Tell her to find a place to meet me, right now.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.864
- Thank you.
- What, are you banging her?

07:29.241 --> 07:31.992
She wouldn't let him
bang her, would she?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.913
May I have your attention, please...

07:35.997 --> 07:38.582
- John, Gina.
- How are you? Come here.

07:38.667 --> 07:40.167
Good, I'm good.
John, how are you?

07:40.252 --> 07:43.796
I'm great. Never thought
giving you free extra sauce as a kid would

07:43.880 --> 07:46.465
get me a first-class visit to Hollywood,
but here we are, huh?

07:46.550 --> 07:48.008
Looks like we're needed.
What are you,

07:48.093 --> 07:50.177
some kind of
California man-orexic now, Turtle?

07:50.262 --> 07:52.304
- Jesus.
- I'm saving room for your garlic bread.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.640
Plus you haven't seen me
since I dropped the baby fat.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.101
- Yeah, and your accent...
- Bullshit. I'm as Queens as ever.

07:57.185 --> 07:58.394
- Let me get that for you.
- If you say so.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.937
So what do you got
planned for us?

08:00.021 --> 08:02.857
I thought I'd get you
settled in the hotel, have a nice lunch

08:02.941 --> 08:04.775
- then get right down to business.
- Hotel?

08:04.860 --> 08:07.987
I thought we were like family? No room
for the De Lucas at Vinnie's mansion?

08:08.071 --> 08:10.156
- Actually we live in a hotel now.
- Oh my God.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.866
You really have gone
Hollywood, haven't you?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.160
Are you sure you're the right
guy for the Don Peppe name

08:14.244 --> 08:16.328
or are you gonna make us do
some Italian fusion bullshit?

08:16.413 --> 08:18.414
I would never think about
tinkering with your food.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.166
- You better not.
- And we live in a hotel

08:20.250 --> 08:22.084
because I burned down our house.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.378
For what?
An insurance scheme?

08:24.462 --> 08:25.921
No, no, no,
it was an accident.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.340
Good, because we're not
looking for any bullshit out here, you know?

08:28.425 --> 08:31.927
No bullshit, John.
I'm here to work 24/7 to make this happen.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.888
And I am certain that
I will not disappoint you.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.764
First thing you do
to avoid that,

08:35.849 --> 08:37.308
make sure my wife meets a movie star.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.351
- And not Vince, huh? We've seen him plenty.
- All right.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.477
Turtle, do you know
where Brad Pitt's house is?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.313
- Uh, no.
- How about George Clooney?

08:43.398 --> 08:45.357
She loves George Clooney.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.109
I don't think it's that bad.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.528
She says I'm an insecure
womanizer "whose game is

08:49.613 --> 08:52.364
"to feign respect for women
in order to get them into bed. "

08:52.449 --> 08:53.866
Look, you're focusing
on just that.

08:53.950 --> 08:56.368
All the stuff about your
recovery and your comeback

08:56.453 --> 08:58.871
- is fantastic.
- I don't want my mother reading this.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.457
- I don't want anyone reading this.
- Vince.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.459
- Do you think this is accurate?
- Of course I don't.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.628
- Then we gotta do something.
- Like what?

09:05.754 --> 09:08.088
- Call her and tell her to edit it.
- She's not gonna do that.

09:08.173 --> 09:10.674
Then call the editors and tell
them not to print it. This is garbage.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.760
- Well, they don't think so.
- How do you know?

09:12.844 --> 09:14.678
- Because I just got another email.
- What does it say?

09:14.763 --> 09:16.972
It says they love it
and they're giving us the cover.

09:17.265 --> 09:19.225
- Oh, fuck.
- Where are you going?

09:19.309 --> 09:20.267
I'm going to see her.

09:20.352 --> 09:21.727
But we have a photo shoot
to finish here, Vincent.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.729
I don't give a shit.
Tell them to finish it without me.

09:24.022 --> 09:26.857
They don't need an accurate article.
Why would they need an accurate photo?

09:26.942 --> 09:28.108
Vince!

09:31.488 --> 09:32.780
Barbara, hi.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.366
"Barbara, hi. "
What kind of a weird greeting is that?

09:36.076 --> 09:37.701
- What would you like?
- It's not what I'd like,

09:37.786 --> 09:40.746
but I'm more used to
"hey, Babs, you're so old

09:40.830 --> 09:43.415
"I'm surprised they didn't
carry you here in a coffin. "

09:43.500 --> 09:45.167
No. You look great.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.336
Why did you summon me
to your office, Ari?

09:47.462 --> 09:50.547
Summon you? No.
I actually just wanted to see if you were in.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.841
- I was gonna come to your office.
- What do you want?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.345
Ahem, my marriage is
clearly over and as you know

09:56.429 --> 09:59.974
my wife legally is going to be
entitled to her capital back...

10:00.058 --> 10:01.100
No.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.894
- No?
- No, I won't float you.

10:03.979 --> 10:07.147
Who's asking you to?
I simply wanted to take it out of the company.

10:07.357 --> 10:09.358
- Borrow it.
- $1 1 million?

10:09.484 --> 10:10.943
Yeah.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.988
I know you don't visit
the accounting department very often,

10:14.072 --> 10:17.157
but cash flow is
not ideal right now.

10:17.409 --> 10:20.077
Then float me. You probably
have that much in your Depends.

10:20.537 --> 10:21.537
There you go, Ari.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.749
Barbara, look, if we don't
give her the money back...

10:25.834 --> 10:28.752
I don't know. She could end up
in the boardroom with us.

10:28.837 --> 10:31.797
How the fuck did I
let this happen? How did you?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.466
Look, I never thought this
was gonna happen. Ever.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.802
And you didn't want to put
any more of your money into this company.

10:36.886 --> 10:38.512
Not with you having 51 %.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.472
Who would you fantasize about
if you didn't have a boss?

10:40.557 --> 10:44.518
I'll write you a check, Ari.
But I want a majority stake.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.229
- I'd rather leave.
- And go where?

10:48.982 --> 10:52.693
Amazing.
World-class chauvinist Ari Gold's balls

10:52.777 --> 10:55.571
are being held by two women.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.239
Who'da thunk it?

11:00.744 --> 11:02.536
Good power today, Drama.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.580
That's the power
of the people behind me, Danny.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.082
- You can't let the man keep you down.
- Can't and won't.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.002
- Today I'm taking the man down.
- Johnny!

11:10.086 --> 11:11.086
Lloyd, what are
you doing here?

11:11.171 --> 11:12.880
Eric told me where
I could find you.

11:12.964 --> 11:15.007
- You got some news?
- I'm hearing that the network

11:15.091 --> 11:17.801
is preparing to shut down
Johnny Bananas for good.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.679
- They could be bluffing, right?
- They've already ordered

11:20.764 --> 11:23.932
an extra batch of Mike & Molly
episodes to replace you with.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.519
- I don't believe it.
- Greed is no longer good, Johnny.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.606
This isn't about greed, Lloyd.
It's about doing good work.

11:30.774 --> 11:31.774
- Come on.
- Let's go, come on.

11:31.858 --> 11:36.195
You could be doing good work at
a dinner theater in Boca Raton, Florida,

11:36.279 --> 11:39.406
if you don't get back to work.
I'm told you have until sundown.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.160
- Are you advising me to scab, Lloyd?
- Just dig down inside

11:43.244 --> 11:45.871
and decide if you really
can't do this show without Dice.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.665
If that's true, then I will
try and find you anotherjob,

11:48.750 --> 11:51.335
even though it took almost
two decades to find one this good.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.090
I don't know what
you're so offended about.

11:56.174 --> 11:59.551
- You gave me a car for sex.
- Aww, Eric's feeling used.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.471
- No, I'm not.
- The car was for the show.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.432
- I'm sending you something else for the sex.
- I don't want anything.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.518
- Nothing?
- No. I wanted to rep you,

12:07.602 --> 12:09.395
but now I'm thinking maybe
it wasn't such a good idea.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.064
Oh, are you kidding?
You're like my little lucky charm.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.483
You sent me in on a general
and I booked a series.

12:14.651 --> 12:17.069
You booked the series because you're good,
not because we had sex.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.113
- Eh, potato, potahto.
- I think you're using me

12:19.197 --> 12:20.656
to piss Terrance off.
That's what I think.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.950
- Melinda, great to have you today.
- Hey, Scott.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.702
- Nice to see you. Enjoy your lunch.
- Thank you so much.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.416
Okay, yes, at first maybe.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.084
But I was angry at Terrance

12:32.168 --> 12:34.920
and now I'm not.
I'm an emotional actress.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.965
- One day I'm sad, now I'm happy.
- Mel, this isn't good.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.634
You'd really walk away from all the
money we're gonna make together?

12:40.718 --> 12:43.178
- You're gonna force me to.
- You're still worried about Sloan.

12:43.430 --> 12:44.847
- No, I'm not.
- You are.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.226
I can't believe I didn't fuck you good
enough to make you forget about her.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.853
Melinda, stop it, please.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.355
Honey, listen,
this is just business.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.899
I don't even need to fuck.
Maybe just a little

12:56.025 --> 12:58.026
flirt here and there
to keep my mojo going.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.946
I know how addicting
sex can be with me,

13:01.030 --> 13:03.282
- but I'm not looking for a relationship.
- Neither am I.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.200
- So we're all good.
- Good.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.536
- Mr. Murphy.
- Johnny Galecki.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.079
- Hey, how are you doing?
- How are you? I'm doing well.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.206
- You know Melinda Clarke.
- I do indeed.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.875
- How are you, Melinda?
- I'm great.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.588
Eric here is the best thing
that's happened to me in a long time.

13:18.006 --> 13:19.006
I'll be right back.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.718
- She likes you, huh?
- She's cool.

13:23.761 --> 13:25.179
- Have a seat.
- She tried to fuck me

13:25.263 --> 13:26.513
at the Golden Globes last year.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.682
- Followed me right into the men's room.
- Really?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.768
Well, maybe I followed her
into the ladies' room.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.022
I was a little busted up.
It's all kind of a blur.

13:35.106 --> 13:38.066
Either way.
Wasn't she married to Sloan's dad?

13:38.568 --> 13:40.986
- Yeah. How'd you know that?
- Sloan told me.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.529
At dinner last night. Actually

13:43.656 --> 13:45.616
what she told me was
that she's freaking out

13:45.825 --> 13:48.911
at the thought of you possibly
having sex with her ex-mom.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.122
And I told her she
was just being paranoid.

13:52.207 --> 13:57.044
But after seeing
you two basically lost in each other's eyes,

13:57.128 --> 13:58.420
maybe she wasn't.

14:01.466 --> 14:02.674
Anywho.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.929
Not my business.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.609
If you want to turn to page 8,

14:20.693 --> 14:22.903
you'll see the breakdown
of my profit projections.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.863
You've got some
big names down here.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.950
I was hoping we'd
see some big names here, like stars.

14:28.785 --> 14:30.035
All the names on this list

14:30.119 --> 14:33.163
are real New Yorkers who I know love
Don Peppe's. You got Mark Teixeira,

14:33.248 --> 14:35.541
- Amar'e Stoudemire...
- You're friends with these people?

14:36.167 --> 14:38.043
Friends enough to ask
them for 1 00 Gs each.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.128
Yeah, but who are you
friends with out here, Turtle?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.381
- Like do you know anyone on Glee?
- No.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.884
- Why isn't Vince on here?
- Vince isn't involved in this.

14:45.969 --> 14:48.470
- Vince doesn't like Don Peppe's?
- Vince loves Don Peppe's.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.514
It's just I'm trying
to do my own thing.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.599
- Oh my god.
- What, baby?

14:52.684 --> 14:55.018
9:00, a guy from Saturday Night Live.

14:55.478 --> 14:56.979
- Intro her, Turtle.
- I don't know him.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.565
- Just intro her anyway.
- I've never met him in my life.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.691
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.734
Hi, hi. I'm a huge fan

15:02.819 --> 15:05.070
and I would like you to sign an autograph.
Just right over here.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.738
- Are you somebody too?
- Oh no, no.

15:06.823 --> 15:09.283
Just get in the shot. Ready?

15:10.285 --> 15:11.994
- Got it.
- There you go.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.579
I never signed
a blueprint before.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.539
Yeah, could you
write something funny?

15:15.999 --> 15:18.333
- Sure. There's "something funny. "
- Yeah.

15:18.459 --> 15:19.459
Well, that's very clever.

15:19.961 --> 15:22.337
Jay Leno makes a smiley face. Find him.

15:23.881 --> 15:24.923
So it's really true, huh?

15:25.174 --> 15:27.259
That very tiny little guy
gets lots of pussy.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.469
It's not important.
Guys, can we get back to this?

15:29.554 --> 15:32.222
I worked very hard on this stuff
and I want to hear what you think.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.016
I'm sorry, Turtle.
I know you worked hard,

15:34.100 --> 15:37.436
but I cook.
I don't look at blueprints and graphs.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.938
- So let's go look at the real space then.
- You got a place in mind?

15:40.023 --> 15:42.733
- An amazing one.
- No, no, no, baby, we got the Lakers game.

15:42.817 --> 15:45.193
- Yeah, in like five hours.
- Gina wants to get there early,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.070
see if she can meet Jack Nicholson.

15:47.155 --> 15:50.032
- I really wanted you guys to look at it today.
- We'll see it tomorrow.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.618
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.745
Turtle, you got a limo
taking us to the game?

15:55.747 --> 15:57.080
Naw, I just figured
I'd drive you there.

15:57.165 --> 16:00.042
No, you don't have to do that. Get us a limo.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.211
Yeah.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.551
- Mind if I sit?
- For a minute. I'm waiting for someone.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.720
- I'll be fast.
- Is this a coincidence?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.723
No, I talked to your assistant
and she told me where I could find you.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.475
- Really?
- Oh, but please don't be mad at her.

16:16.559 --> 16:20.395
I charmed and deceived her.
And I wasn't even trying to get her into bed.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.899
- What do you want, Vince?
- I opened up to you and you mocked me.

16:24.192 --> 16:27.402
- I don't see it that way.
- I have good relationships with women.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.655
- I write what I see.
- I don't know how

16:29.739 --> 16:31.907
after everything else
I shared with you, you could see that.

16:32.116 --> 16:34.951
I don't know why you're focusing on
a tiny part of a six-page article.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.912
Because it's not true.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.915
I have tons of respect for women and not
just the ones I want to sleep with.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.708
And you
show it by stalking me to a restaurant?

16:42.085 --> 16:44.002
- I wouldn't call this stalking.
- What would you call it?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.837
- I want to talk.
- What do you think that would accomplish?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.256
- I want to correct your opinion of me.
- Why?

16:48.675 --> 16:50.717
- Why?
- Yes. The article is done.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.344
I couldn't change it now
even if I wanted to.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.929
I'm sure even you're smart enough
to know that.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.099
- I am.
- So what's the point in this?

16:58.643 --> 17:01.937
I guess I want you not to think
what you wrote about me.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.397
Why?
What's the difference?

17:04.482 --> 17:07.275
I'm just a journalist
you don't know who won't sleep with you.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.361
- Do you think you can change that?
- No, I...

17:09.444 --> 17:11.696
If you want to leave a good impression,
next time you get overexcited

17:11.781 --> 17:13.406
during an interview,
restrain yourself.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.701
Wait until you go out
and catch the eye of one

17:15.785 --> 17:18.578
of the 50 random women,
which will help you achieve the same effect.

17:18.829 --> 17:19.954
Unless you care what
they think about you too,

17:20.039 --> 17:21.748
in which case you need
to reevaluate your whole self-image.

17:21.833 --> 17:23.709
- Bhagwan.
- Miss Lear.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.002
- Hi.
- Vincent Chase.

17:26.087 --> 17:27.796
Vincent, this is
Professor Bhagwan Chowdhry

17:27.880 --> 17:29.464
- from the UCLA Anderson School.
- How do you do?

17:29.549 --> 17:32.175
- Hi.
- Professor Chowdhry's an expert in finance

17:32.385 --> 17:35.178
and I'm writing a piece
on his financial access at birth initiative.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.639
- Wow, I love that.
- You've heard of F.A.B.?

17:38.266 --> 17:40.642
Uh no, but I'm excited
to read about it now.

17:41.102 --> 17:42.728
Probably won't get
the cover like you.

17:43.855 --> 17:45.772
Convincing world leaders
and private funders

17:45.857 --> 17:49.443
to open a $1 00 savings account
for every child in the world

17:49.777 --> 17:51.945
isn't as sexy
as a Hollywood star.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.197
- But far more interesting.
- Thank you.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.992
Anyway, I'll let you go to it.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.618
- And you.
- Sophia.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.078
Bye, Vince.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.666
Ari, I am imploring you
not to do this.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.085
We are not your
run-of-the-mill divorce.

18:07.170 --> 18:08.837
I've known her
since I'm 1 9.

18:09.172 --> 18:11.548
I just want to speak to her
for five minutes rationally.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.341
Rationality goes out the window
with these things.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.302
Please trust me
and get back in your car.

18:15.428 --> 18:16.928
No can do.
I'll call you after.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.138
Ari!

18:19.265 --> 18:21.391
It's really important to make
sure that the blade is flush.

18:21.517 --> 18:23.477
- Right. You do that so perfectly.
- I've got good hands.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.103
- You do.
- So do you.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.271
Oh.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.526
Oh, okay, stop, like,
because we're in my house

18:31.611 --> 18:33.445
- and I... I...
- You stop me wherever we are.

18:33.571 --> 18:35.614
I know, I'm sorry.
I just... I'm not...

18:35.698 --> 18:37.741
I know, you're not ready. I get it, I get it.

18:37.867 --> 18:39.451
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.203
It's okay.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.248
Holy shit, it's Ari!

18:45.333 --> 18:47.959
- Relax, just answer it.
- No. Do you really think that I should?

18:48.044 --> 18:49.544
- I got it.
- No, wait, no, no!

18:49.629 --> 18:51.797
Stay, stay, Bobby.
I'll go do it.

18:51.881 --> 18:55.091
You stay here and just...

18:55.176 --> 18:56.384
Stay.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.430
- Ari, what are you doing here?
- I didn't walk in the house. I rang the bell.

19:00.515 --> 19:01.556
I'm trying to be respectful.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.892
Respectful is a phone call
and the kids aren't here.

19:04.060 --> 19:07.312
- Well, I came to see you.
- Ari, please, this is not okay.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.940
Look, I understand that you have made
up your mind and all I want

19:10.024 --> 19:12.818
is for you to be happy.
But there are some

19:12.902 --> 19:14.986
financial things that
we need to discuss.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.614
- We have lawyers.
- And I know I'm not supposed to talk about it,

19:17.698 --> 19:19.616
but I have some
real concerns right now.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.826
I... I'm sorry.
I can't, you know.

19:20.910 --> 19:24.120
- I could lose the company.
- I can't talk right now.

19:24.205 --> 19:27.207
- After 20 years you can't talk?
- Not right now.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.291
I'm sorry.

19:31.254 --> 19:33.588
- What do I smell?
- I'm cooking.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.383
- That's not your cooking.
- Ari!

19:36.467 --> 19:38.593
- Is Flay in my fucking house?
- You want to talk money?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.929
We can!
The first thing I'm gonna bring up is that

19:41.013 --> 19:43.765
- this is not your house.
- Holy shit.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.350
- He's in my house?
- Ari, no!

19:45.434 --> 19:46.643
Yo, grill master!

19:46.727 --> 19:48.812
- Ari, Ari, just don't.
- Are you in my fucking house?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.565
I've got a new show for you. It's called
Boy Meets Husband Who Kills Him.

19:51.649 --> 19:54.192
- Ari, Ari!
- I'm not hiding, Ari.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.944
- Well, you should.
- Please, Bobby.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.572
Melissa, it's okay.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.324
I don't fucking believe it.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.034
What?
What don't you believe?

20:03.119 --> 20:06.371
What? More lies about how all
you care about is how happy I am?

20:06.455 --> 20:09.583
- You are so full of shit.
- I have never hidden who I am.

20:09.667 --> 20:13.211
Obviously you have.
I have no idea who you are.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.214
From here on out we're
gonna let the lawyers handle everything.

20:16.966 --> 20:20.677
Look, honey, I've changed.
I'm leaving my house

20:20.761 --> 20:22.971
with you and your
barbecuing boy toy in it,

20:23.055 --> 20:24.973
no fight,
no cops called,

20:25.057 --> 20:28.268
no tears, no beating
his fucking face in.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.276
Come in, it's open!

20:37.653 --> 20:39.738
Drama, you don't
look so good.

20:39.822 --> 20:40.864
What's the problem?

20:40.948 --> 20:43.325
How could you play poker
when we don't have a job?

20:43.659 --> 20:46.369
- I have a job.
- And I never lose at poker.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.412
You know who this is?

20:47.496 --> 20:50.165
Hey, guys, could we just play
some fucking cards, please?

20:50.249 --> 20:55.003
- Yes, Mr. Happy.
- Dice, the network's canceling the show.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.421
- Officially.
- All right, all right.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.131
Guys, keep playing.
I'll be right back.

20:58.215 --> 21:01.217
Mack, make sure nobody cheats.

21:01.510 --> 21:04.846
Johnny, what, are you cracking
a couple days on the lines?

21:05.473 --> 21:09.059
Do you know 30 men went
on a hunger strike

21:09.143 --> 21:12.854
in the salt mines of Belarus?
Some of them starved to death,

21:12.939 --> 21:14.731
but they knew what
they was doing was right.

21:14.815 --> 21:19.027
Well, Dice, I don't want to starve to death.
I think we should go back.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.821
I believe it'll
all work out in the end if we do a good job.

21:21.906 --> 21:25.325
Drama, it is working out.
They've already contacted my people.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.828
- Really?
- Yeah, if you don't crack, it's gonna get done.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.330
They're just trying
to get you nervous

21:30.414 --> 21:33.458
so you fuck me which will
ultimately fuck you.

21:33.542 --> 21:36.711
So do me a favor, stay strong.

21:38.381 --> 21:39.881
- It's Phil.
- Don't pick it up.

21:40.800 --> 21:42.300
- Hey, what...
- Hey, Phil, how are you?

21:42.385 --> 21:45.303
Great, listen, Les Moonves
sent over a script to produce

21:45.388 --> 21:48.306
for a miner-with-a-labrador
movie that your brother wants to make

21:48.391 --> 21:50.141
- with you and Billy Walsh.
- You read it?

21:50.351 --> 21:51.726
- Read what?
- Yeah, I did.

21:51.936 --> 21:54.145
Did you know that Les Moonves
is one of my best friends?

21:54.397 --> 21:56.690
- No.
- Did you know that I was best man

21:56.774 --> 22:00.068
- at his and Julie Chen's wedding?
- No, I didn't know that.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.029
Did you know that I saved
Les Moonves's

22:03.114 --> 22:05.240
Great Dane from drowning
when he was a puppy?

22:05.533 --> 22:07.283
No, I didn't know that either.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.869
You know it all now.
And now you know this:

22:09.954 --> 22:13.081
I will make sure that this
fucking movie never gets made.

22:13.457 --> 22:15.417
Anywhere! And if it does,

22:16.043 --> 22:18.753
I'll hire an exact
fucking replica of you...

22:18.921 --> 22:20.171
- Hang up! Who cares?
- ... to star in it

22:20.256 --> 22:22.090
if you don't get your ass back to work.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.760
This is the moment
that men choose their fates. Choose yours.

22:25.928 --> 22:28.805
- What's he saying?
- Not only are we gonna lose Johnny Bananas,

22:28.889 --> 22:30.348
but he's gonna bury my miners.

22:30.433 --> 22:33.226
- What's your answer, Johnny?
- I can't have it all go to shit, Dice.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.562
Show him how strong you are.
You believed when you came into this

22:35.646 --> 22:38.606
- you had the right goal, right?
- Yeah, yeah, but I don't know.

22:38.691 --> 22:42.569
Maybe I'm just
a crazy self-sabotager like my therapist says.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.946
What's your answer, Johnny?
Right fucking now!

22:46.741 --> 22:49.242
- I'm sorry, Phil.
- Good man!

22:49.368 --> 22:50.827
Good man! Yes!

22:51.620 --> 22:53.705
- I think I'm gonna be sick.
- Come on, come on.

22:54.331 --> 22:56.875
Just breathe through your nose.
Come on, out your mouth.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.960
- Eleanor, get him water.
- I'm going.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.796
Everything's going to be fine.

23:04.467 --> 23:05.633
Hello.

23:06.635 --> 23:08.136
- Phil.
- Oh, no.

23:09.263 --> 23:10.346
Yeah.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.557
What... What's he saying?

23:12.641 --> 23:14.476
Talk to me, Phil. What?

23:16.228 --> 23:17.979
- What?
- Okay then.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.110
- We're done?
- Done?

23:24.195 --> 23:26.613
Drama, I'd rather be dead
than be disrespected.

23:26.697 --> 23:28.907
- The show's canceled?
- Yeah, it's canceled.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.745
God, I am such a fucking loser.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.084
Drama, I'm kidding.

23:39.168 --> 23:41.461
They made the deal.
We're back on.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.089
- You were fucking with me?
- I fuck with everybody.

23:44.799 --> 23:48.259
They caved
and Johnny Bananas rides again.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.931
- Thank god.
- Victory.

23:54.183 --> 23:55.266
Yeah!

23:56.352 --> 23:58.186
Huh? Yes.

23:59.188 --> 24:01.231
- We had a good time, right?
- The best.

24:01.315 --> 24:03.191
Why, you want
to give us another go?

24:03.275 --> 24:05.652
I just want to make sure
you didn't feel used.

24:05.778 --> 24:08.863
Vince, you're a great guy.
Why are you beating yourself up?

24:09.198 --> 24:10.865
I had a little
reality check today.

24:11.492 --> 24:13.118
What we had wasn't the deepest,

24:13.202 --> 24:14.828
most intellectual relationship,

24:14.912 --> 24:16.538
but I'm sure
you've had your share.

24:16.747 --> 24:18.998
I mean I'm one of what?
A thousand?

24:19.166 --> 24:21.626
- No.
- More?

24:22.628 --> 24:24.129
You know,
I'm not good at math.

24:24.213 --> 24:25.213
Whatever you are...

24:27.049 --> 24:29.509
Who you are was
good enough for me.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.053
- And for my sister.
- Your sister?

24:32.263 --> 24:34.139
Yeah. Marissa,
she works at Goal.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.892
- Marissa is your sister?
- Yeah.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.854
I didn't know. Sorry!

24:42.773 --> 24:44.274
- Look.
- What's that?

24:44.358 --> 24:46.317
That is the back
of Leo's head at a Laker game.

24:46.402 --> 24:47.360
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:47.444 --> 24:48.444
The De Lucas are
sending me pics.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.822
I gotta make
a collage of all the celebrities' heads.

24:50.906 --> 24:51.990
Maybe you should have
gotten better seats.

24:52.074 --> 24:53.449
You should have
company tickets.

24:53.534 --> 24:54.659
What did they think
of the space?

24:54.743 --> 24:57.537
They're gonna look at it
tomorrow if the Lakers win.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.998
- And what if they don't?
- I don't know.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.417
- How'd it go with the waitress?
- She said I wasn't very deep.

25:02.793 --> 25:06.254
- But you already knew that.
- Turtle, how many relationships have I had?

25:06.422 --> 25:09.924
- Huh?
- Deep, real, meaningful relationships?

25:10.009 --> 25:12.051
- Not counting us?
- Women.

25:12.887 --> 25:15.013
- I don't think any.
- Seriously, come on.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.432
Oh, what about
the ass mechanic, Sasha?

25:17.766 --> 25:19.142
We talked about sex mostly.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.936
- Mandy Moore.
- We were like 1 2.

25:22.730 --> 25:24.606
- Yo, what up?
- What's up, E?

25:24.690 --> 25:25.690
You know anything about Sloan

25:25.774 --> 25:27.525
- and Johnny Galecki?
- No!

25:27.610 --> 25:29.694
I just ran into him.
He basically claims he's fucking her.

25:30.279 --> 25:32.280
I called her five times.
She won't return my call.

25:32.489 --> 25:34.532
I thought she didn't
date actors.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.243
- You think maybe she did bang Seth Green?
- Okay, E,

25:37.411 --> 25:40.038
I swear to God I don't know
anything about this, okay?

25:40.122 --> 25:43.249
Well, now you know.
So either you fire him or you and I are done.

25:48.172 --> 25:51.507
All I want

25:51.592 --> 25:56.221
Is food and air and shelter and water

25:57.932 --> 26:01.935
And you

26:02.019 --> 26:08.316
You and your mammalian locomotions

26:11.195 --> 26:15.823
I know you are my love

26:16.867 --> 26:22.914
Mammalian locomotion

26:22.998 --> 26:26.501
A stellium of stars

26:45.062 --> 26:48.356
When I want

26:48.440 --> 26:53.695
A starlit sky reflected in ocean

26:54.863 --> 26:56.489
Then I know...
