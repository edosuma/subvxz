(FIRECRACKERS EXPLODING)

00:24.033 --> 00:26.300
Hats off to Tanis,
boys.

00:26.333 --> 00:28.200
It's certainly a great day
for Thunder Bay.

00:28.233 --> 00:30.366
Yeah, Tanis has
outdones herself.

00:30.400 --> 00:31.866
She sure did.

00:31.900 --> 00:33.100
Say, where is Tanis?

00:50.533 --> 00:52.933
Well, Tanis the

00:52.966 --> 00:54.133
Tough gal.
Homewrecker.

00:54.166 --> 00:55.200
Rocket.
Sniper.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.866
Alpha female.
Temptress.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.133
A bit rough around the edges.

00:58.166 --> 01:00.066
Tried to lure you
in to the barn for a...

01:00.100 --> 01:01.400
Round of the bases.
Homewrecking.

01:01.433 --> 01:02.833
Slam.
Crush.

01:02.866 --> 01:05.066
Roll in the hay.
Lay in the biblical sense.

01:05.100 --> 01:07.866
Toe curl.
And the truth is
you kinda wanted to...

01:07.900 --> 01:09.400
Pet heavily.
Wreck your home?

01:09.433 --> 01:11.100
Rack up a kill.
Score a take down.

01:11.133 --> 01:12.366
Have the best sex
of your life.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.200
Fondle?
Become one.

01:14.233 --> 01:16.566
But you didn't.
Because that's not what a...

01:16.600 --> 01:18.066
Good 'ol boy.
Real man.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.166
Straight shooter.
Team player

01:19.200 --> 01:21.033
Seriously?
God‐fearing gentleman.

01:21.066 --> 01:23.000
Stand up guy.
Does.

01:23.033 --> 01:24.833
On the contrary, a...

01:24.866 --> 01:26.200
Good 'ol boy.
Real man.

01:26.233 --> 01:27.300
Straight shooter.
Team player.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.166
Pussy.
God‐fearing gentleman.

01:29.200 --> 01:30.700
Stands‐up guy.
Doesn't cheat.

01:30.733 --> 01:34.400
So while you walked
towards the barn for what one
would assume was a...

01:34.433 --> 01:36.466
Poke.
Terrible fucking idea.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.066
Easy kill.
Quick mash.

01:38.100 --> 01:39.233
Whatever you are into, baby.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.866
Lustful encounter.

01:40.900 --> 01:42.200
A lot of character
is undertaken.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.233
You didn't.

01:43.266 --> 01:46.900
You got in the truck,
drove over to Rosie's and...

01:48.300 --> 01:49.500
Now, Rosie is a...

01:49.533 --> 01:51.433
Real pretty gal.
So fucking cute.

01:51.466 --> 01:52.500
Ten.
Damn.

01:52.533 --> 01:54.100
Book reader.
Goddess.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.266
Fine woman.
You can't be
with one woman

01:56.300 --> 01:58.000
and have feelings
for another.

01:58.033 --> 02:00.033
You are of the opinion
that cheaters are...

02:00.066 --> 02:04.166
In the wrong.
Like, 95% in the wrong.

02:04.200 --> 02:06.000
Bad?
Or...

02:06.033 --> 02:07.500
Seduced.
Fair and square.

02:07.533 --> 02:09.166
Antagonized.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.300
Likely a good persons
who just mades a mistake.

02:11.333 --> 02:13.433
And you shouldn't very well
go down that road.

02:13.933 --> 02:14.966
So...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.233
BOTH: Here's the thing...

02:16.266 --> 02:17.366
BOTH: Okay, you go.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.033
BOTH: No, you go.
Okay, I'll go.

02:20.066 --> 02:21.433
I'm gonna move
to the city.

02:21.466 --> 02:23.000
You are gonna move
to the city?

02:23.033 --> 02:24.166
I'm gonna move
to the city.

02:24.200 --> 02:25.766
What city?
Vancouver.

02:25.800 --> 02:29.233
Well, you won't get
many random snowy summer nights
like this in Vancouver.

02:29.266 --> 02:31.500
Nope.
So what's in Vancouver?

02:31.533 --> 02:32.633
Pit bull rescue.

02:32.666 --> 02:36.066
I'm tired of reading
about it every day.
I wanna help.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.333
You're
a great fucking gal,
Rosie.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.166
You're
a great fucking dude,
Wayne.

02:40.200 --> 02:41.233
When will I see you?

02:41.266 --> 02:43.133
When you see me.
Good enough.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.133
And that's what
a get out of jail free card
looks like.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.133
Boy, howdy.
Well, I should say.

02:48.166 --> 02:49.433
Sick buddy.
Sick, bro.

02:49.466 --> 02:51.033
Can we bang now?
Wondrous!

02:51.066 --> 02:52.133
I likes Monopoly.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.033
So, as for Tanis...

02:54.066 --> 02:55.466
Get after it.
Sure.

02:55.500 --> 02:56.900
Killzone?
Poundtown?

02:56.933 --> 02:58.500
We should be
banging right now.
Tanis.

02:58.533 --> 03:00.300
You could do much worse,
good buddy.

03:00.333 --> 03:03.100
You and Tanis
are gonna give her
the old college try.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.200
Good enough.
Good enough.

03:04.233 --> 03:05.500
BOTH: Good enough.
Good enough.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.966
Good enough.
Good enough.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.366
Good stuff.

a non‐summer weddings.

03:21.533 --> 03:22.966
I'm smilings.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.433
Well, it seems
a little bit unfair

03:24.466 --> 03:27.233
that at summer weddings
gals get to wear
a nice, breezy summer dress

03:27.266 --> 03:28.600
and then we're stuck
being sweaty

03:28.633 --> 03:30.433
and sticky in some
three‐piece wool suit.

03:30.466 --> 03:32.400
I guess it can gets
quites pongies down there.

03:32.433 --> 03:34.233
Yeah, it can get
a bit moist.
No.

03:34.266 --> 03:36.333
Who do you think
is gonna moist the Stanley Cup,
this year, Katy?

03:36.366 --> 03:38.500
I'm thinking Calgary.
I swear to fucking Christ

03:38.533 --> 03:39.733
Oh, did you
never see
Moist Story?

03:39.766 --> 03:42.200
Or Moist Story 2,
starring Tim Allen
and Tom Hanks?

03:42.233 --> 03:44.266
Are you out of
your fucking mind?
I will fight you.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.966
We don't fight
at weddings.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
So, Dary,
are you gonna be
wearing your dad's suit?

03:49.033 --> 03:50.500
Do falling timbers
make tambers?

03:50.533 --> 03:52.400
Who the fuck are you?
Yes, Katy.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.200
I got it
for a grade 13 semi‐formal
from the Letterkenny Op shop.

03:55.233 --> 03:57.466
Loves the Op shops.
I'll take the Sally Ann.

03:57.500 --> 04:00.933
You know what?
That suit is so dad
the last time you wore it,

04:00.966 --> 04:04.100
it told me the Dire Straits
were the greatest band
of all time.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.433
That suit is so dad

04:05.466 --> 04:07.866
it ate all the lunch meat
on the way home
from the grocery store.

04:07.900 --> 04:10.966
The suit is so dad
it owns a VHS copy
of The Hunt for Red October.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.466
So, Dan,
are you gonna
cold rock a kilt?

04:12.500 --> 04:15.133
Like my Grandpas
and his grandpas
before him.

04:15.166 --> 04:16.433
A little class,
a little sass

04:16.466 --> 04:18.600
and a lot of ass
all in one
tartans garments.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.600
Wayne,
I assume you'll be wearing one
of only two suits that you own.

04:21.633 --> 04:24.333
Two will do you.
One for weddings
and one for funerals.

04:24.366 --> 04:27.533
A good suit lasts you
the rest of your life
if you take care of it.

04:27.566 --> 04:29.966
What would you wear
for a court appearance?
I've never been arrested.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.233
What would you wear
to a job interviews?
I've only ever had one job.

04:32.266 --> 04:34.233
KATY: What would you wear
to a bar mitzvah?
Not Jewish.

04:34.266 --> 04:36.200
Bat mitzvahs?
Still not Jewish.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.366
Graham's from the city.

04:37.400 --> 04:39.566

a lot of citiots
at this thing.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.100
(GROANS)

04:41.133 --> 04:42.433
I fucking hate citiots.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.533
They're always going on
about how we're saying,

04:44.566 --> 04:48.066
"fucking mud in our
fucking hammies".

04:48.100 --> 04:51.866
Fucking riding
our sleds down to
a fucking pit party, bud.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.366
Giving her tits.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.433
I was climbing the ladder
up the hay mound
behind your brother and ew!

04:57.466 --> 04:59.833
Ripped a fart
that sounded like
a creaky door opening

04:59.866 --> 05:01.500
inside a hot air balloon, but...

05:02.433 --> 05:05.400
We do not fight
at weddings.

05:05.433 --> 05:09.000
No, but we can get laid
if we're keen to.

05:09.033 --> 05:11.300
Sexy just wafts around
at weddings.

05:11.333 --> 05:13.966
Plenty of opportunities
for people looking
to do some yessing.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.933
A little bit
of wedding spreading.

05:15.966 --> 05:18.200
A little bit of matrimonies
and hide the balonies.

05:18.233 --> 05:21.233
Oh, sure,
maybe some exchanging of rings
and rubbing of things.

05:21.266 --> 05:22.500
KATY: Clear eyes.

05:22.533 --> 05:23.800
Full Windsors.

05:24.533 --> 05:25.533
ALL: Can't lose.

06:41.466 --> 06:43.000
Clean up well,
Cowboy.

06:43.033 --> 06:45.033
Well, a good suit
will last the rest of your life
if you take care of it.

06:45.066 --> 06:46.466
And me?

06:46.500 --> 06:48.533
Well, I wouldn't kick you
out of bed for eating
fucking crackers, Tanis.

06:48.566 --> 06:50.233
Top shelf ceremony,
boys.

06:50.266 --> 06:52.133
Short, sweet
and not too much God.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.866
I'm told God
doesn't have much time
for gays these days, so...

06:54.900 --> 06:56.100
Par for the course,
I guess.

06:56.133 --> 06:58.966
Real prouds of Dax and Ronsford
jumps in the brooms like that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.166
Good guys.
Good grooms.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.033
I wonder what
that must be like.

07:03.066 --> 07:04.133
What?
Getting hitched?

07:04.166 --> 07:07.400
No, being into dudes.
I've got so many questions.

07:07.433 --> 07:09.266
Yeah,
and I wanna hear
exactly zero of them.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.133
It's like,
what if you
are attracted

07:11.166 --> 07:13.033
to somebody
with the same name as you?

07:13.066 --> 07:15.400
Is it like,
"How fun"?

07:15.433 --> 07:17.600
Or is it fucking weird?
It'd be fucking weird.

07:17.633 --> 07:20.000
Quite likely.
That's never happened to me.

07:20.033 --> 07:23.833
Guess the closest I ever came
to it was almost doing it
with a gal named Sheryl.

07:23.866 --> 07:25.266
Yeah, I suppose
it'd kindsa be
like the time

07:25.300 --> 07:28.366
I almost hooked up
with a gal who had
the same names as my Grandmas.

07:28.400 --> 07:29.566
That would be
fucking off‐putting.

07:29.600 --> 07:33.566
It was.
It was distracting
at inappropriate times...

07:33.600 --> 07:35.033
With...

07:35.066 --> 07:36.300
Ruth.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.166
I wish there was
a goddamn way
I could do it with a Katy.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.933
Ew!
Or a Kate
or a Caitlin.

07:40.966 --> 07:42.966
I guess Katherine
would even be
walking the line.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.400
There's no way
I could do it
with a Wayne.

07:44.433 --> 07:47.500
Ew!
Unless it was Gretzky
or Rostad.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.366
Or Newton.

07:50.000 --> 07:52.133
(CHEERING)

07:52.166 --> 07:54.166
I'd bow to the great ones.
I'd bend right over.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.066
I'd like Gretzky
in my office
behind the net.

07:57.100 --> 08:00.066
I'd be a jar of curry
in a fucking hurry just
feeding him all night long.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.400
I promised Mess
I wouldn't do this.

08:01.433 --> 08:02.466
I just promised
to mess.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.233
I'd let Gretzk
leave my ass
seriously McSorely

08:05.266 --> 08:07.066
I'd let that lady
Bing lady bang me.

08:07.100 --> 08:09.133
That's 69 with 99
into overtime.

08:09.166 --> 08:11.000
I'd just straight up
let him 99 me.

08:11.033 --> 08:13.833
Howdy who.
Ah, what's a 99?

08:13.866 --> 08:16.033
It's just fucking
while spooning.

08:16.066 --> 08:17.233
(CHUCKLES)

08:19.333 --> 08:21.033
All right, boys.

08:21.066 --> 08:22.400

what you can do
with a cock.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.066
Oh, are you fucking
matting her?

08:35.100 --> 08:36.966
Is she
a charity ride,
like, "Holy Fuck"?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.000
Just about clear putting it
in the fucking rhubarb.

08:39.033 --> 08:41.300

rubbing your peckers or what?

08:41.333 --> 08:43.100
Oh, she's
fucking tits,
eh?

08:43.133 --> 08:45.433
D'you give her beans, bud?
D'you give her boots, bud?

08:45.466 --> 08:46.600
Do you give her
fucking torque?

08:46.633 --> 08:48.100
MAN: Do you wanna get
fucking smoke?

08:48.133 --> 08:49.300
Or are you
taking her easy?

08:49.333 --> 08:51.266
If she's easy,
take her twice, bud.

08:51.300 --> 08:53.266
We'll call you
toonie two times.

08:53.300 --> 08:54.366

where you...
We don't fight at weddings.

09:03.566 --> 09:06.833
Those citiots
can fucking tie
their dicks in a knot.

09:06.866 --> 09:08.100
They can go
piss up a rope.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.933
Gretzky, Rostad
and Newton
for Katy, eh?

09:14.200 --> 09:15.833
I'm surprised
Lil Wayne
didn't make the cut.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.166

09:20.200 --> 09:22.033
Great dress, Bonnie.

09:29.366 --> 09:32.966

09:33.000 --> 09:35.433
You should be honored.
My buddy here

09:35.466 --> 09:37.000
Only tens.
Right in the X.

come outside.
I'll show you the 3.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.300
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

09:50.333 --> 09:53.933
Stewart, I know
you are the world's
foremost fire selector,

09:53.966 --> 09:56.933
but this is a wedding
and I promised the grooms
we'd play songs like

09:56.966 --> 09:59.466
Brown Eyed Girl
and Shout
and Lean on Me,

09:59.500 --> 10:02.166
Ain't No Mountain High Enough
and Mambo No. 5

10:02.200 --> 10:04.300
Yous guys
got the Chicken Dance
ready to play yet?

10:04.333 --> 10:05.733
I fucking love that song,
I'll tell you.

10:05.766 --> 10:08.366
I put it on in the barn
for the cluckers
when them pecker‐faced bastards

10:08.400 --> 10:10.166
ain't dropping eggs,
I just love it.

10:10.200 --> 10:11.800
Are you
being facetious?
Huh?

10:11.833 --> 10:15.366
Can your vestigial minds
even comprehend the derogatory
nature of your requests?

10:15.400 --> 10:16.666
Or maybe
you could compromise?

10:16.700 --> 10:18.566
Do something cool
like beat juggle
the <i>Chicken Dance?</i>

10:18.600 --> 10:19.966
Here, take...

10:22.133 --> 10:23.333
Enough!

10:23.366 --> 10:25.500
Deejaying is an art form.

10:25.533 --> 10:29.500
A medium in which
the most prolific audio auteurs
of our time can speak through.

10:29.533 --> 10:31.600
A deep connection
of the soul of yourself

10:31.633 --> 10:33.433
and the gyrating asses
of the great unwashed

10:33.466 --> 10:37.300
who eagerly thirst
for your deafening
compositions.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.166
I like gyrating asses
but I'm pretty sure
it ain't art there, bud.

10:40.200 --> 10:42.333
Yeah, wouldn't you have to
have written the songs yourself
for it to be art?

10:42.366 --> 10:44.033
I'm sorry,
composed?

10:44.066 --> 10:45.600
I think the word
is produced.

10:45.633 --> 10:49.233
Right, or at least
didn't download off the Internet
so you could profit off them.

10:49.266 --> 10:51.833
Yeah, you are
more like an art dealer
than an artiste.

10:51.866 --> 10:53.900
Or like
an art gallery curator.

10:53.933 --> 10:55.300
Selling stolen paintings.

10:55.333 --> 10:57.000
That you printed
off the Internet.

10:57.033 --> 10:58.466
(BOTH LAUGHING)

10:59.300 --> 11:00.933
Whoa!

11:00.966 --> 11:02.000
If you do not
fall back,

11:02.600 --> 11:04.100
and fasten that lip.

11:05.000 --> 11:08.266
Your other,
thinner lip.

11:08.300 --> 11:13.900
I'll turn this elegant, soigne
ceremony of the coming together
of two bonded souls

11:13.933 --> 11:16.066
into a straight up blood rain.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.000
Hey!
Over here.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.833
Chicken Dance.

11:21.300 --> 11:22.466
Get it?

11:26.200 --> 11:27.833
(MUTTERING)

11:29.433 --> 11:30.933
Just wanna go
(CLUCKING)

11:33.633 --> 11:35.566
Good game
you fucking beauties.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.233
Way to tape your
sticks together, boys.

11:37.266 --> 11:39.000
You two make
a hot pairing.

11:39.033 --> 11:41.366
Five minute major
and a lifetime misconduct
for butt ending.

11:41.400 --> 11:42.833
You boys
enjoying yourselves?

11:42.866 --> 11:44.266
Acting single.
Seeing double.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.500
Drinking triples.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.333
Daxy, I gotta say,

11:50.366 --> 11:52.933
solid work
on the big city
slam prospects.

11:52.966 --> 11:55.166
Solid big city
slam scouting, Daxy.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.066
Boys, a little, uh,
players only here.

11:58.100 --> 11:59.433
You are not
pulling tonight.

11:59.466 --> 12:00.500
BOTH: Yes, we are.

12:00.533 --> 12:01.733
These are
modern city gals.

12:01.766 --> 12:03.966
None of them
have any interest
in hockey player types.

12:05.533 --> 12:08.166
Boys, big muscles haven't
been popular with the ladies
since <i>Jersey Shore.</i>

12:08.200 --> 12:11.966
The only way to get
any attention from a
cosmopolitan, college gal type

12:12.000 --> 12:14.100
is to get in touch
with your inner twink.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.866
You need to be less
power forward

12:15.900 --> 12:17.366
and more power bottom.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.500
We'll get
our wedding stylist
to help them out.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.266
So we need to...

12:23.600 --> 12:25.133
Spruce up our look?

12:25.166 --> 12:26.266
No.

12:27.433 --> 12:31.066
You gotta bruce
up your look.

12:31.100 --> 12:34.366
So Professor Tricia says
that Letterkenny has developed
into quite the homosexual scene

12:34.400 --> 12:37.600
and we can rightly expects
a Pride parades next springs.

12:37.633 --> 12:39.933
Never been to
a Pride parade.
What's it like?

12:39.966 --> 12:41.233
It's like a Santa Claus parade.

12:41.266 --> 12:43.966
Except instead
of handing out candy,
they hand out condoms.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.566
I should probably start
thinking about a name
right now.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.600
Great Day for gay.
A Hard Gay's Night.

12:47.633 --> 12:49.566
Eyes Pride Shut.
Pride Green Tomatoes.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.866
Pride of Chucky.
Independence Gay.

12:51.900 --> 12:53.433
Ferris Bueller
Gets Off.

12:53.466 --> 12:55.133
Star Wars
Rogue One.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.933
The Princess Pride.
Pride of Frankenstein.

12:57.966 --> 12:59.900
Pride and Go Seeks.
Carlito's Gay.

12:59.933 --> 13:02.033
Night of the Giving Head.
Lay Anything.

13:02.066 --> 13:03.233
Final Mantasy.

13:03.266 --> 13:04.433
Third Cock from the Sun.

13:04.466 --> 13:06.266
How fella Got
His Groove Pack.

13:06.300 --> 13:08.233
The Gay the Earth
Stood Still.

13:08.266 --> 13:09.433
Eat, Gay, Love.

13:09.466 --> 13:10.466
Dr. Strangelove

13:10.500 --> 13:12.866
or how I learned
to stop wearing,
"Love the Bum".

13:13.566 --> 13:14.966
Bonnie and Pride.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.366
ALL: Oh, Bonnie McMurray.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.966
You boys tried
the catering yet?

13:19.000 --> 13:21.566
I am chomping at the bit
to get one of those cupcakes.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.066
Nots to be impolite,
Dary

13:23.100 --> 13:26.000
but it's actually
champing at the bits.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.366
Oh, you got those
pits ready for your
fucking ponies?

13:28.400 --> 13:31.166
How many ponies you got
under your hood? You got
a frigging hemmy under there?

13:31.200 --> 13:32.900
How many
CCs is your sled?

13:32.933 --> 13:35.033
Do you fucking pin her
when you get pickled there, bud?

13:35.066 --> 13:37.100
Oh, I really fucking gave it
to her last night.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.833
Working hard
or hardly working?

13:44.300 --> 13:46.366
What happened
to the part where...
We don't fight at weddings.

13:48.133 --> 13:49.600
I gotta piss.
KATY: I'll come with you.

13:49.633 --> 13:51.900
BONNIE: Yeah, same.
Okay, let's go. (CLEARS THROAT)

13:55.633 --> 13:57.566
My cock he lives now.
(CHUCKLES)
Redux.

14:07.100 --> 14:08.366
What's up,
ladies?

14:08.400 --> 14:09.566
What is
your nationality?

14:09.600 --> 14:10.933
Grow up
around here?

14:10.966 --> 14:12.166
Have any tattoos?

14:12.200 --> 14:14.066
I got a Celtic symbol
on my calf.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.066
I got a Nike swoosh
right above my heart.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.866
I got you a drink.
I swear it's not
a roofie.

14:19.900 --> 14:21.300
Yes, it is.
Of course, it is.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.966
Hey, that's
a real nice dress.

14:23.000 --> 14:24.600
Look a lot nicer
on my hotel room floor.

14:24.633 --> 14:26.833
You ever seen
the front seat
of a Honda del Sol?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.200
I'll have a roll
in your hay any day.

14:29.233 --> 14:31.100
We don't fight
at weddings.

14:31.133 --> 14:33.333
I got a Harman Kardon
system in the 3.

14:33.366 --> 14:36.466
X3.
BM motherfucking W,
baby.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.200
It's actually
way better than Bose.

14:49.933 --> 14:51.333
Dickskin?
Dickens.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.866
Fellas, a list
of my requests.

14:55.900 --> 14:57.933
To be played back two,
back two, three, four,
well I have five songs...

14:58.300 --> 15:00.066
No requests.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.066
How dare thou
come into
my private roost

15:02.100 --> 15:07.000
of penetrating beats
with an audacious act
of social and musical treason.

15:07.033 --> 15:09.200
Every single one of these
is a Brooks and Dunn song.

15:09.233 --> 15:10.866
Starting with
the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.333
I didn't realize
they had other songs.

15:12.366 --> 15:13.966
Of all the boogies,
the Boot Scootin'
is the last one I would

15:14.000 --> 15:16.300
and will ever torture
myself or others with.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.500
I'll give you
a Boot Scootin'.

15:17.533 --> 15:20.033
What about
Blame It on the Boogie
by the Jackson 5?

15:20.066 --> 15:21.566
Boogie, Oogie, Oogie,
A taste of honey.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.466
Boot Scootin'.
Boogie Wonderland,
by Earth Wind & Fire

15:23.500 --> 15:24.766
Elton John's
Street Boogie.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.166
This wedding needs a boogie
and it's gonna be <i>Boot Scootin'.</i>

15:27.200 --> 15:28.400
Born to Boogie,
T Rex?

15:28.433 --> 15:29.966
Boogie Woogie Wu,
Insane Clown Posse.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.366
Zip Gun Boogie,
T Rex again.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.866
Take the damn boogie
and make it
a Boot Scootin'.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.566
I'm Your Boogie Man,
KC and the Sunshine band.

15:35.600 --> 15:37.500
I'm Your Boogieman,
White Zombie.

15:37.533 --> 15:40.100
I hoped it wouldn't come
to blows over a boogie.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.900
But I'll damn well
go to blows.

15:43.933 --> 15:45.433
For the Boot Scootin' Boogie.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.200
Not happening,
Dickskin.
Dickens!

15:54.266 --> 15:55.966
I got it.
I got it.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.333
I got the Chicken Dance.

15:57.366 --> 15:59.133
Went home and got it
out of the cassette player
in the tractor.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.466
You play it now or later.
Either way, you'll play it.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.866
Or you'll die.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.133
What's with
the super sad
glassware, boys?

16:11.166 --> 16:13.033
What's with your hair?

16:13.066 --> 16:15.033
Oh, just got some
big city prospects.

16:15.066 --> 16:17.300
Don't wanna risk
putting a big goose egg
up on the board.

16:17.333 --> 16:20.033
Don't wanna fan
on a yonny cage, buddy.

16:20.066 --> 16:22.033
So, we bruced up
our looks.

16:22.066 --> 16:23.966
What does that mean?

16:24.000 --> 16:25.533
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it, yeah.

16:25.566 --> 16:27.133
How's that
going for ya?

16:27.166 --> 16:28.966
Uh, good.
We got bites.

16:29.533 --> 16:31.033
Yeah.

16:31.066 --> 16:32.900
Well,
we got like, a...
A bite.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.966
They were 50 though.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.433
I took down
an older lady once.
It was kinda fun.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.366
Kinda weird.
Why?

16:41.400 --> 16:43.866
Well,
after she made a pizza.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.400
Sick, buddy.
She ordered a pizza.

16:45.433 --> 16:47.200
No, made a pizza.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.166
From scratch, buddy.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.466
I had to sit
and talk

16:50.500 --> 16:53.900
while she made
a pizza.

16:53.933 --> 16:55.233
You two
look like dandies.

16:55.266 --> 16:56.266
You look
like pansies.

16:56.300 --> 16:57.966
You know,
the landscape
might be changing

16:58.000 --> 16:59.800
but manly men
never go out of style.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.833
Hello, ladies.

17:08.866 --> 17:11.066
Yeuch, I can't drink
this shit anymore.

17:11.100 --> 17:13.266
What am I
a ballerina trying
to get skinny?

17:13.300 --> 17:14.533
I'm gonna get
some rye, babe.

17:14.566 --> 17:15.800
Cheers.

17:21.100 --> 17:22.533
Katy got hit on
by a top hat guy.

17:22.566 --> 17:25.333
A top hat.
A guy in a top hat.

17:25.366 --> 17:28.333
I'd rather take down
a city than a guy
in a top hat.

17:28.366 --> 17:29.366
Oh, I don't know,
Ms. Katys.

17:29.400 --> 17:32.233
Some men looks
quite statelys
in a top hat.

17:32.266 --> 17:33.933
Scrooge McDuck
comes to mind.

17:33.966 --> 17:35.433
Mr. Peanut.
Slash.

17:35.466 --> 17:37.233
The guy from T Rex.
Abe Lincoln.

17:37.266 --> 17:40.000
Uncle Pennybags
from Monopoly.
Willy Wonka's.

17:40.033 --> 17:42.566
The Cat in the Hat.
Guy from T Rex again.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.533
Oh, hey there,
buds.

17:44.566 --> 17:46.866
Is she a manual?
Or are you driving
a bitch stick?

17:46.900 --> 17:49.566
You like bud lite?
You like butt holes
around here.

17:49.600 --> 17:52.366
Oh, did you get
your pecker stuck
in a bottle of brew?

17:52.400 --> 17:53.533
Where's your sweety bud?

17:53.566 --> 17:55.833
Did she leave you
to your John
and your John Deere?

17:55.866 --> 17:57.533
Where's your John queer, bud?

18:04.366 --> 18:06.400
I was brought up on
Looney Tunes and only dancing
when nobody's around.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.166
Learned the heck
out of it that way, Dan.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.333
I am fucking irritated.

18:09.366 --> 18:10.966
We don't fight
at weddings.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.000
Right.

18:12.866 --> 18:15.433
We don't fight
at weddings.

18:16.633 --> 18:18.400
Ten four?
Over and out.

18:21.033 --> 18:22.866
Hello, ladies.
Ladies.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.033
Can we interest you
in a shot of sourpuss?

18:25.066 --> 18:27.300
Perhaps a half glass
of white zinfandel?

18:27.333 --> 18:29.500
Have you looked at
any interesting furniture
lately?

18:29.533 --> 18:32.066
I admire his eye
for interior design.

18:32.100 --> 18:33.200
What are you two
going on about?

18:33.233 --> 18:34.566
You are really
missing the mark.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.200
You know,
metrosexuality
went out of style

18:37.233 --> 18:39.066
with the Von Dutch
and Chingy.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.966
We are into men.
Classic men, athletic types.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.166
You don't look like
you can fix my car.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.133
You don't look
like you can fix
a sliding screen door.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.400
What?
Wha... What?

18:47.433 --> 18:50.233
We're ...
We're hockey players.

18:50.266 --> 18:52.266
We're the snipe,
celly boys.

18:52.300 --> 18:53.966
Dirty fucking
dangles boys.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.366
What are you guys
going on about now?

18:55.400 --> 18:57.966
