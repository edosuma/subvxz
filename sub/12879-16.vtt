not tell me?

You go on about how I
have to be responsible

me, yet you didn't trust me

We should have had

that I had to put behind me.

leave Athenia?

Bringing an Other
back wasn't allowed.

18:29.775 --> 18:31.360

my brother said.

"An Other could
never be queen!"

Harsh.

regret it?

No, my time with your mom was
too short but it was magical.

18:40.828 --> 18:42.246
So...

18:42.329 --> 18:43.497
what would she
want you to do?

18:43.580 --> 18:48.210
She would tell me to be peaceful
and to let my heart decide.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.212
She would tell me to
keep moving forward.
