[high-pitched giggling]

01:07.317 --> 01:08.443
[Bular]
<i>Impure.</i>

01:08.527 --> 01:10.279
[suspenseful music playing]

01:11.280 --> 01:15.617
-[laughing]
-Who--? It... It can't be.

01:15.701 --> 01:18.912
Bular? I thought you were dead.

01:18.996 --> 01:23.292
I live. Only to find you've left my father
to rot in the Darklands?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.671
You dare to conspire
to steal my father's throne?

01:27.754 --> 01:29.923
No, I would never betray...

01:31.383 --> 01:35.554
The Inferna Copula?
You think Angor Rot will bring your reign?

01:35.637 --> 01:39.224
[laughing]

01:39.308 --> 01:41.560
Abandon the ring now,

01:41.643 --> 01:45.689
before I feast on your corpse
and floss with your intestines.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.482
Bular, please!

01:47.566 --> 01:49.318
Oh, boy.

01:49.401 --> 01:52.237
Oh, you shall beg. Abandon the ring!

01:52.321 --> 01:54.740
[gasps]
She just walked right--

01:54.823 --> 01:56.074
[laughing]

01:57.659 --> 01:58.952
Pixies.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.370
[high-pitched giggling]

02:03.332 --> 02:04.833
[high-pitched screaming]

02:04.916 --> 02:10.547
Angor! You dare attempt to distort
my mind with a pixie?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.049
[laughing]

02:14.926 --> 02:18.930
The nightmare would scare the ring
from my hand?

02:19.014 --> 02:20.265
-[grunts]
-[gasps]

02:20.349 --> 02:23.977
You are a dog and this is your leash!

02:28.190 --> 02:29.900
I am your master.

02:31.735 --> 02:36.615
Obey my command
and kill the Trollhunter!

02:36.698 --> 02:41.662
Then you should avoid
that school of yours tomorrow.

02:47.959 --> 02:51.880
But the ring will be mine.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.548
[school bell rings]

02:53.632 --> 02:56.802
Jim Lake asked you to the dance
and you didn't tell us?

02:56.885 --> 03:00.138
Spill it, C-bomb,
before Mare and I go ka-boom.

03:00.222 --> 03:04.476
There's not much to really tell,
except... I sorta asked him.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.353
-[both gasp]
-Good, girl!

03:06.436 --> 03:09.314
Excuse me, Darci. Do not celebrate.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.690
Educate.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.651
That's not the way you do things, Claire.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.737
There are rules to being on top
of the social food chain.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.532
What sort of world
do you think we live in?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.783
If only you knew.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.119
-[Darci] My goodness, really?
-[Mary] You don't want to know.

03:22.202 --> 03:25.205
Look at my face and tell me that
you do not want to know what happened.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.082
[yelps, groans]

03:28.041 --> 03:29.084
[sobs]

03:29.793 --> 03:32.462
I can't feel my arms.

03:32.546 --> 03:34.673
First day of training can do that,

03:34.756 --> 03:37.175
but you are the one
that wanted the war hammer.

03:37.259 --> 03:40.053
Hey, hey. Next time a magic troll assassin
pinches your sword,

03:40.137 --> 03:43.098
you'll be happy ol' Warhammer
and Shadowdancer have your back.

03:43.181 --> 03:47.769
"Shadowdancer"? Let me guess.
You haven't run that by Claire.

03:47.853 --> 03:50.522
Well, Tobes, rest up.
We can at least feel safe in school

03:50.605 --> 03:52.899
knowing Angor Rot won't attack us
in broad daylight.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.902
Oh, my gosh, I think I can feel
a little baby muscle growing.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.738
[water running]

04:05.370 --> 04:07.289
[high-pitched giggling]

04:07.372 --> 04:08.457
[grunts]

04:09.708 --> 04:12.878
Sweet dreams, hunter.

04:14.713 --> 04:17.339
I fear Master Jim
is in far more danger than we imagined.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.303
According to the <i>Gloomanac,</i>
Angor Rot made a Faustian bargain.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.555
Faustian?

04:23.638 --> 04:29.019
In exchange for his magnificent sorcery,
he cursed his soul into a single ring,

04:29.102 --> 04:30.604
the Inferna Copula.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.482
Mm, picture. Helpful.

04:33.565 --> 04:35.192
Whoever bears it, controls him.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.235
Aaarrrgghh, it says here

04:37.319 --> 04:39.988
that Angor's been stealing
the souls of Trollhunters

04:40.071 --> 04:43.909
in a blasphemous attempt
to fill the void ever since.

04:43.992 --> 04:47.704
-[moans]
-You don't have to hide it from me.

04:47.788 --> 04:50.832
I might only have two eyes,
but I can see clear as day.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.250
It's obvious.

04:52.334 --> 04:55.962
Ever since my human deformity,
you have been distant.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.757
Uh... yes. Distant.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.427
I may look different,
but I'm still the same Blinky.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.597
How about, to cheer you up,
maybe later today,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.808
I could rent a mini-van,
we could go for a drive?

05:07.891 --> 05:09.976
Something with tinted windows, of course.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.271
I hear we're not too far away
from the world's largest thermometer.

05:13.355 --> 05:14.856
I bet you could eat it!

05:14.940 --> 05:16.775
Mm, not today.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.946
Perhaps another time, my dear friend.

05:22.239 --> 05:24.991
Oh, hey, Steve.
I finished your math homework,

05:25.075 --> 05:27.702
and I've already wired lunch money
into your account.

05:27.786 --> 05:30.330
Maybe we can skip
the locker stuffing today?

05:30.413 --> 05:32.374
-Eli, we've discussed this.
-Ow!

05:32.457 --> 05:35.460
I make the rules. I'm the alpha.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.588
-Who am I?
-Steve Palchuk.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.881
[screams]

05:39.965 --> 05:41.967
-[laughs]
-[groans]

05:42.050 --> 05:45.387
And there can only be one.

05:48.098 --> 05:51.518
Phase one, find out the name
of the cute blonde in biology.

05:51.601 --> 05:57.107
Phase two,
ask said cute blonde to Spring Fling.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.441
Phase three...

06:00.235 --> 06:02.988
-[toilet flushes]
-...make all her dreams come true.

06:03.071 --> 06:04.614
[laughs]

06:04.698 --> 06:05.740
-I love you.
-[grunts]

06:05.824 --> 06:07.450
[water running]

06:08.118 --> 06:12.497
-What up, bro?
-[gasps] Who are you? Who are you?

06:12.581 --> 06:15.917
-Steve Palchuk. MVP, on the field and off.
-[whimpering]

06:16.001 --> 06:20.088
-Future king of Arcadia Oaks High.
-[stammering] No, you can't be Steve.

06:20.171 --> 06:23.800
-I'm Steve. I'm Steve!
-Ooh! Ooh-hoo!

06:23.883 --> 06:26.636
You may need to let that one rest. Dang.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.680
No! No, no, no!

06:28.763 --> 06:30.265
[whimpers, screams]

06:32.350 --> 06:34.394
-[chuckles]
-[screams]

06:34.477 --> 06:35.562
[screaming]

06:35.645 --> 06:38.189
[whimpering]

06:38.273 --> 06:40.317
What up, Steve? High-five.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.193
So, what are you benching, like, uh...?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.362
-[both] What are you looking at?
-[screams]

06:45.572 --> 06:46.698
I'm Steve.

06:46.781 --> 06:50.076
You're not Steve!
I'm Steve! I'm Steve! I'm Steve!

06:50.160 --> 06:52.203
-What was that all about?
-SAT season.

06:52.287 --> 06:56.207
I'll tell you, one kid snaps
like a snow pea every spring.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.752
[school bell rings]

06:58.835 --> 07:00.962
So... "Shadowdancer"?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.589
-Well--
-Don't you think I should be--

07:02.672 --> 07:04.633
I don't know--
coming up with my own name?

07:04.716 --> 07:05.925
Sorry, too much?

07:06.009 --> 07:09.054
Hardly. How about "Queen Death Viper 5000
of the Shadow Realm"?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.556
Yeah! That's more like it.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.683
[high-pitched giggling]

07:13.767 --> 07:15.560
...the Puente de San MartÃ­n Bridge

07:15.644 --> 07:16.978
crosses the...

07:18.271 --> 07:20.273
Sorry, I was, um...

07:21.524 --> 07:22.776
As I was saying...

07:22.859 --> 07:24.653
...crossing the Tagus River.

07:24.736 --> 07:28.740
The bridge is considered a masterpiece
of Spanish architecture.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.325
After the Killahead Bridge
was destroyed...

07:30.408 --> 07:33.370
-Wait, Killahead?
-...in the Battle of Tagus River,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.956
the question then became...

07:36.039 --> 07:40.543
"Why wasn't Claire paying
better attention to her baby brother?"

07:40.627 --> 07:42.003
[gasps]

07:42.504 --> 07:45.256
Why, Claire?
Why would you let them take him?

07:45.340 --> 07:47.968
It's all your fault!

07:53.640 --> 07:56.059
[grunts]

07:56.142 --> 07:57.686
-[baby crying]
-[gasps]

07:58.687 --> 08:00.271
-[baby cooing]
-En...?

08:00.355 --> 08:01.606
Enrique?

08:01.690 --> 08:02.565
[gasps]

08:07.696 --> 08:09.906
Enrique! Stop!

08:11.825 --> 08:14.077
[Vendel]
Your fears are true.

08:14.160 --> 08:17.247
You've been nicked
by Creeper's Sun poison

08:17.330 --> 08:19.916
and you're turning to stone.

08:21.209 --> 08:24.254
You have medicine?

08:24.337 --> 08:26.006
To slow it, yes.

08:26.089 --> 08:27.257
To cure it...

08:28.425 --> 08:31.219
regrettably, no.

08:31.302 --> 08:35.222
Sooner or later,
the poison will overtake you.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.140
Mmm...

08:39.144 --> 08:40.979
How long?

08:41.062 --> 08:45.150
Weeks. With treatment, a few months.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.986
You need to tell your friends.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.030
-No.
-No?

08:50.113 --> 08:52.866
Don't want Toby to know.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.868
-I understand.
-[sighs]

08:55.827 --> 08:59.080
Then this will be our secret.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.004
What do you mean the dino-park is offline?

09:06.087 --> 09:07.547
[screams]

09:07.630 --> 09:10.050
-This is bad.
-Definitely not SATs.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.052
-There! There are shadows!
-My teeth are all gone!

09:12.135 --> 09:16.473
There's monsters in our town!
Why won't anyone believe me?

09:16.556 --> 09:18.516
No! Who took my clothes?

09:18.600 --> 09:21.436
-It's like we're invisible, dude.
-No, we're not invisible.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.148
They're sleepwalking,
like a night terror but in the day.

09:25.231 --> 09:28.151
-Have you seen Claire?
-No. Who do you think did this?

09:28.234 --> 09:31.404
I don't know, but I bet you
Strickler is involved. Come on.

09:35.784 --> 09:39.746
No running! No screaming!
No acting weird.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.706
-What's happened to you all?
-[high-pitched giggling]

09:43.166 --> 09:44.626
Oh!

09:44.709 --> 09:49.172
What do you mean, it's opening night?
Why is the spotlight on me? [chuckles]

09:49.255 --> 09:51.424
Line? Line!

09:53.009 --> 09:54.844
No surprise he's gone.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.722
This is supposed to be our safe place,
Jim! What's happening?

09:57.806 --> 10:00.266
Why is everyone crazy-town banana-pants?

10:00.350 --> 10:03.436
I don't know, but I don't like it either.
I need time to think.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.188
We may be down a Shadowdancer,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.649
but Warhammer ain't leaving
your side, bud.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.861
Tobes, don't move.
There's something glowing on you.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.488
-[screams, whimpers]
-[high-pitched giggling]

10:13.571 --> 10:16.866
-[whimpering]
-Stay very, very still.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.701
-[high-pitched giggling]
-[whimpering]

10:18.785 --> 10:21.871
-It's in my nose! It's in my nose!
-Blow your nose! Hurry, hurry!

10:21.955 --> 10:23.123
[snorting]

10:23.206 --> 10:24.999
Oh, my gosh, it's inside of me!

10:25.083 --> 10:27.252
Oh, no! This is what's happening
to everybody else!

10:27.335 --> 10:28.211
[groans]

10:29.129 --> 10:31.464
We don't know that.
Toby, don't freak out.

10:31.548 --> 10:34.300
-You need to study me.
-What are you talking about?

10:34.592 --> 10:37.387
Like in the movies. I'm that guy.
I'm the test subject you gotta study

10:37.470 --> 10:39.597
to learn how to fight
the stupid alien creatures.

10:39.681 --> 10:42.559
Whatever happens next,
you have to pay close attention--

10:42.642 --> 10:44.435
-attention-- attention--
-What? Are you insane?

10:44.519 --> 10:50.316
Strange sensations,
heart rate rising. My mind is...

10:50.400 --> 10:51.609
[groans]

10:51.693 --> 10:53.194
Toby! Tobes!

10:56.823 --> 10:58.074
It's you!

11:01.119 --> 11:03.204
[soft whimsical music playing]

11:07.333 --> 11:09.377
Hey, you, mole.

11:09.460 --> 11:12.964
[psychedelic music playing]

11:15.133 --> 11:17.302
[heart beating]

11:44.454 --> 11:50.335
[in slow-motion]
Will you be my date to Spring Fling?

11:58.509 --> 12:00.011
I love you,

12:00.094 --> 12:03.014
[in gravelly voice]
Toby-pie...

12:03.097 --> 12:03.932
[screams]

12:04.015 --> 12:05.475
Get away from me, Nana!

12:05.558 --> 12:07.852
[screaming]

12:07.936 --> 12:09.187
[continues screaming]

12:09.270 --> 12:12.523
-And there goes Warhammer.
-Get away from me, Nana!

12:12.607 --> 12:15.360
Thank you so much
for coming over, Mr. Blinky.

12:15.443 --> 12:19.572
Well, to be frank, I'm concerned
about Jim's progress.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.698
-Ugh!
-Oh!

12:20.782 --> 12:25.161
-Would you like some cream for that?
-Oh, yes, please. The whipped kind.

12:25.244 --> 12:27.330
Okay.

12:27.413 --> 12:30.041
As for your concern about Jim,
he's had his final growth spurt,

12:30.124 --> 12:32.502
but his voice should be changing soon.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.128
Ah, thank you!

12:34.212 --> 12:38.007
I meant his odd behavior.

12:39.717 --> 12:44.055
Not his voice. But, you know,
the late nights, the lying.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.224
Jim has a solid head on his shoulders.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.310
And now that we've blasted
through his emotional roadblocks,

12:49.394 --> 12:52.522
you shouldn't witness any more
unusual outbursts from your son.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.067
[phone vibrating, ringtone playing]

12:56.150 --> 12:57.068
Hello?

12:57.151 --> 13:00.238
Blinky, everyone's going
crazy-town banana-pants!

13:00.321 --> 13:01.447
Uh...
[chuckles]

13:01.531 --> 13:04.951
Oh, good, good. Good afternoon,
Mr. President Eisenhower.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.328
I suppose I could pencil you in.

13:07.412 --> 13:10.957
Help! I've got flying glow-balls
making everyone crazy.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.002
It's like they're all trapped in a dream
and can't wake up.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.254
No, no, no! No more mole madness!

13:16.337 --> 13:17.672
[screams, groans]

13:17.755 --> 13:21.467
<i>It sounds like an infestation</i>

13:21.551 --> 13:24.053
Blinky, I only have time
for the cheat sheet, not the textbook.

13:24.137 --> 13:26.264
<i>-Pixies.</i>
-Get away from me, Nana!

13:26.347 --> 13:28.141
-Pixies? That's it?

-Stop looking!
-One thousand and two pirouettes.

13:50.913 --> 13:51.914
I'm barn dooring! I'm...

Glory!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.136
[chuckles]

14:05.928 --> 14:08.306
Now to ignite the accelerator.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.390

14:55.353 --> 14:58.272
-[gasps]
-You've kept your wits, hunter.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.983
Let's see if you can keep your head.

15:01.067 --> 15:03.111
Okay, then. Plan B.

Oh, no. No!

17:36.806 --> 17:38.057

-[whimpering]

18:08.504 --> 18:09.755
I'm sorry.

18:09.839 --> 18:11.674
A gentleman never strikes a lady,

18:11.757 --> 18:12.925
but I'm no gentleman.

18:13.009 --> 18:15.970
-Just do it, Toby. Just do it!
-No, wait. Wait up, Enrique.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.180
I'm not Enrique, Claire! I'm Toby!

18:18.264 --> 18:20.725
Enrique, when did you learn how to talk?

18:20.808 --> 18:23.728
-Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!
-Wait, Enrique. Wait, no.

-Hey!
-Uh...

18:28.232 --> 18:29.942
Toby, what the heck is going on?

18:30.026 --> 18:33.529
No time! Now, stick these up your nose
and let's go protect Jim.

18:33.613 --> 18:36.532
[suspenseful music playing]

There! There's Jim!

18:41.662 --> 18:43.372
[both grunting]

18:43.456 --> 18:46.917
May today be an example, hunter.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.670
Nowhere is safe for you.

18:49.754 --> 18:53.341
You are never beyond my reach.

18:53.424 --> 18:57.720
Even right here, protected by peers,

18:57.803 --> 19:01.932
nothing can stop me from getting to you.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.809
Then what are you waiting for?

19:03.893 --> 19:06.562
You know nothing of waiting.

19:06.646 --> 19:10.316
I've waited centuries
to reclaim what is mine...

19:11.025 --> 19:12.026

-What do you want from me?
-I want you to get my ring.

19:25.414 --> 19:27.917
We share a common enemy.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.043
Strickler?

19:29.126 --> 19:32.088
He wears the Inferna Copula.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.632
You will steal it for me.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.509
You want my help?

19:36.592 --> 19:39.845
In return, I shall help you

19:39.929 --> 19:44.141
by severing the connection
between your mother and Strickler.

19:44.225 --> 19:47.353
We will both be free.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.482
-Why should I trust you?
-Because you have no other choice.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.904
The next time our paths cross, hunter,

19:56.987 --> 20:01.575
it will either be the end
of Strickler or you.

Romeo, don't leave me. You can't.

I can't feel them.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.307
-Uh...
-[chuckles nervously]

20:26.600 --> 20:28.060

-Jim! You're alive!

20:47.580 --> 20:49.206
Oh, man!

20:51.292 --> 20:53.127
We really thought we lost you.

-[faint police radio chatter]
-[siren blaring in distance]

20:59.383 --> 21:01.552
-What did you see, Darce?
-Don't ask.

21:01.635 --> 21:04.680
Yeah. Let's never speak of this again.

21:04.764 --> 21:05.598
[whimpers]

21:05.681 --> 21:07.725
I came as soon as I got word.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.269
Please tell me no one was hurt.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.688
[sighs]
They're all accounted for.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.858
Looks like some kind of chemical leak
in your science lab.

21:15.941 --> 21:18.194
That stuff can make you go pretty loopy.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.737
You're lucky no one was hurt.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.825
Very lucky indeed.

21:26.577 --> 21:28.662
Oh! Oh...

By Deya's grace!

21:30.748 --> 21:32.750
[sighs]
You're alive!

21:32.833 --> 21:37.046
Master Jim, I had to run the entire way,
with a lavatory stop or two.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.047
[stomach grumbling]

21:38.130 --> 21:39.256
Oh, dear.

21:39.340 --> 21:42.676
Your automobiles are
the most obstinate machines.

21:42.760 --> 21:46.222
-How did you survive Angor Rot?
-Long story.

21:46.305 --> 21:49.391
Have you heard of the Inferna Copula?

21:49.475 --> 21:51.769
Indeed, I have.
