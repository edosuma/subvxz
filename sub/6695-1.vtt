00:37.370 --> 00:39.565
<i>Our sun is dying.</i>

00:40.273 --> 00:43.140
<i>Mankind faces extinction.</i>

00:45.111 --> 00:49.810
<i>Seven years ago, the Icarus Project
sent a mission to restart the sun.</i>

00:49.983 --> 00:53.783
<i>But that mission was lost
before it reached the star.</i>

00:55.855 --> 01:00.121
<i>Sixteen months ago, I, Robert Capa,
and a crew of seven...</i>

01:00.293 --> 01:03.592
<i>...left Earth frozen in a solar winter.</i>

01:04.964 --> 01:06.488
<i>Our payload...</i>

01:06.666 --> 01:11.603
<i>...a stellar bomb with the mass
equivalent to Manhattan Island.</i>

01:12.472 --> 01:14.440
<i>Our purpose...</i>

01:15.108 --> 01:18.669
<i>...to create a star within a star.</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:47.702
<i>Eight astronauts strapped
to the back of a bomb.</i>

01:48.141 --> 01:49.665
<i>My bomb.</i>

01:51.277 --> 01:53.438
<i>Welcome to Icarus II.</i>

02:26.012 --> 02:27.172
<i>Icarus.</i>

02:27.714 --> 02:29.739
<i>Yes, Dr. Searle?</i>

02:29.949 --> 02:33.407
Please re-filter
the Observation Room portal.

02:33.586 --> 02:37.215
<i>Filter up or down, Dr. Searle?</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:39.519
Down.

02:43.663 --> 02:45.528
Oh, my.

02:48.468 --> 02:53.167
<i>Icarus, how close is this
to full brightness?</i>

02:53.606 --> 02:57.667
<i>At this distance of 36 million miles...</i>

02:57.844 --> 03:02.577
<i>...you are observing the sun
at 2 percent of full brightness.</i>

03:02.916 --> 03:03.974
Two percent?

03:05.418 --> 03:07.113
Can you show me 4 percent?

03:07.287 --> 03:11.724
<i>Four percent would result in
irreversible damage to your retinas.</i>

03:18.631 --> 03:21.964
<i>However, you could observe
3. 1 percent...</i>

03:22.135 --> 03:25.127
<i>...for a period of not longer than
30 seconds.</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:28.306
<i>All right. Icarus, I'm gonna reset...</i>

03:28.508 --> 03:32.604
...the filter to 3.1 percent.

04:09.549 --> 04:11.608
Well, it's invigorating.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.617
It's like taking a shower in light.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.846
- You lose yourself a little.
- Like a flotation tank.

04:18.057 --> 04:19.081
Actually, no.

04:24.597 --> 04:25.962
Look, what is it, beef?

04:26.132 --> 04:27.497
Chicken.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.033
If you don't like it,
you take my shift next time.

04:30.203 --> 04:33.366
For psych tests on deep space,
I ran sensory-deprivation trials.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.007
Testing total darkness
on flotation tanks.

04:36.175 --> 04:40.043
And the point about darkness is,
you float in it.

04:40.213 --> 04:43.046
You and the darkness are distinct
from each other...

04:43.216 --> 04:47.312
...because darkness is an absence
of something, it's a vacuum.

04:47.487 --> 04:50.513
But total light, it envelops you.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.317
It becomes you.

04:54.861 --> 04:56.829
It's very strange. I don't...

04:57.530 --> 04:59.122
I recommend it.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.132
What's strange, Searle,
is that you're the psych officer...

05:02.302 --> 05:04.634
...and I'm clearly a lot saner
than you are.

05:07.507 --> 05:08.531
Good.

05:23.189 --> 05:25.555
All right, if no one's gonna say it,
I'm going to.

05:25.725 --> 05:30.059
The solar wind reading is much higher
than we'd anticipated at this distance.

05:30.229 --> 05:33.426
For the moment we can still send
package messages back.

05:33.633 --> 05:36.101
High-frequency bursts will rise
above interference...

05:36.269 --> 05:39.170
...and the Moon Stations
will be able to pick them up.

05:39.339 --> 05:44.572
But it's possible that within 24 hours
we won't be able to communicate at all.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.234
Possible?

05:47.380 --> 05:49.041
Probable.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.115
We'll finally be on our own.

05:53.286 --> 05:56.551
We're 55 million miles from Earth.
I'd say we're already on our own.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.889
Come on, guys.
We were expecting this.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.118
No great drama.
We're flying into the dead zone...

06:02.295 --> 06:04.695
...seven days sooner
than we thought.

06:05.198 --> 06:09.066
But if any of you are planning
on sending a final message home...

06:09.602 --> 06:11.365
...you should do it now.

06:21.781 --> 06:24.477
Well, Mom and Dad.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.784
I hope you're proud of your son...

06:28.955 --> 06:31.788
...saving mankind and so on.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.955
By the time you get this message,
I'll be in the dead zone.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.821
It came a little sooner
than we thought.

07:09.262 --> 07:13.221
But this means that you won't be able
to send a message back.

07:14.467 --> 07:19.131
So I just wanted to let you know
that I don't need the message.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.798
<i>Because I know everything
you wanna say:</i>

07:31.484 --> 07:37.650
Just remember it takes eight minutes
for light to travel from sun to Earth.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.883
Which means you'll know
we've succeeded...

07:40.059 --> 07:43.324
...about eight minutes
after we deliver the payload.

07:43.496 --> 07:48.024
All you have to do is look out
for a little extra brightness in the sky.

07:48.201 --> 07:52.535
So, if you wake up one morning,
and it's a particularly beautiful day...

07:52.705 --> 07:54.696
...you'll know we made it.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.568
Okay.

07:58.811 --> 08:00.676
I'm signing out.

08:01.714 --> 08:04.012
And I'll see you in a couple of years.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.589
<i>Icarus, dial it down a little, will you?</i>

08:54.767 --> 08:57.031
<i>Yes, Corazon.</i>

09:01.941 --> 09:03.841
Captain?

09:06.646 --> 09:08.273
Captain?

09:10.783 --> 09:13.581
I'm guessing you've been
talking to Searle.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.115
- So, do you have that report for me?
- Yeah.

09:18.291 --> 09:19.588
Right here.

09:21.227 --> 09:25.095
The O2 productivity is good. In fact,
if anything, we're over-producing.

09:25.264 --> 09:27.960
It will trail off dramatically
when we get nearer.

09:28.134 --> 09:32.867
But in truth, we have the reserves
to make it there and a quarter-way back.

09:35.141 --> 09:37.666
<i>You're thinking about Icarus I.</i>

09:39.478 --> 09:42.504
Well, whatever it was
that tripped them up...

09:42.682 --> 09:45.651
...I don't think
it was a lack of oxygen.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.815
Not on the outward journey,
at any rate.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.951
Fuck.

09:55.027 --> 09:56.494
Fuck.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.892
- Mace.
- Mace.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.030
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.103
- Fuck.
- Relax. Put it down.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.330
You son of a bitch.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.301
<i>- Fucker took an hour in there.
- Stop.</i>

10:11.477 --> 10:13.809
I can't send my package,
the wind is too high.

10:13.980 --> 10:17.381
<i>- Calm down.
- I'm sorry, all right? Jesus.</i>

10:17.550 --> 10:20.383
Kaneda, Searle, report to Flight Deck.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.316
<i>What's up?</i>

10:22.655 --> 10:26.614
We have an excess of manliness
breaking out in the Comms Center.

10:30.630 --> 10:31.654
So how does this work?

10:31.864 --> 10:34.059
<i>Am I supposed to tell you
about my childhood?</i>

10:34.233 --> 10:37.361
I probably know more
about your childhood than you do.

10:43.442 --> 10:44.568
It's the time.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.740
Sixteen months,
you can get used to anything.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.717
You just...

10:53.252 --> 10:54.981
...lose track.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.553
I know I fucked up.

11:07.767 --> 11:09.530
From now on...

11:09.702 --> 11:12.398
<i>...I'm not gonna lose track again.</i>

11:14.573 --> 11:15.972
Prescription...

11:17.276 --> 11:19.437
...Earth Room.

11:19.612 --> 11:21.011
Two hours?

11:21.580 --> 11:24.913
- And get a haircut, Mace.
- Yeah.

11:39.598 --> 11:40.792
Bring back the waves.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.868
<i>Dr. Searle's prescription specifies
a peaceful module.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:46.698
The waves make me feel peaceful.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.212
Again.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.931
Mace, I'm sorry.
I should have let you go first.

12:19.105 --> 12:22.438
Capa. It's me.
I'm the one apologizing, all right?

12:22.842 --> 12:24.400
All right.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.678
- Was that the apology?
- Yeah.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.285
- Consider it accepted.
- Okay.

12:59.478 --> 13:03.107
<i>It was a sequence of contact reports
on the top-left shield quadrant...</i>

13:03.849 --> 13:08.445
<i>...which, by 1700, had turned
into a minor asteroid storm.</i>

13:08.621 --> 13:10.646
<i>None bigger than a raindrop...</i>

13:10.823 --> 13:12.381
<i>...but we had 19 punctures...</i>

13:12.591 --> 13:15.890
<i>...and a secondary contact
to the engine compartment.</i>

13:16.095 --> 13:18.791
<i>Took three alpha shifts to patch it up.</i>

13:18.964 --> 13:21.797
<i>Lost a little vapor. Nothing serious.</i>

13:22.301 --> 13:25.031
<i>I watched them hit us
from the Observation Room.</i>

13:25.504 --> 13:28.098
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

13:28.908 --> 13:30.637
<i>It was...</i>

13:31.110 --> 13:32.737
<i>...beautiful.</i>

13:34.246 --> 13:36.806
<i>Gotta tell you, Moon Base, it was...</i>

13:37.683 --> 13:39.344
<i>It was...</i>

13:39.819 --> 13:41.650
<i>...beautiful.</i>

13:57.870 --> 13:59.895
<i>- Mace?
- Yeah.</i>

14:00.072 --> 14:03.041
<i>Your maintenance program
allows a further 14 minutes...</i>

14:03.209 --> 14:06.645
<i>...for the mainframe panel
to remain out of coolant tank.</i>

14:08.180 --> 14:09.738
Shit.

14:34.773 --> 14:35.933
Guys...

14:36.108 --> 14:37.973
...you wanna see something?

14:41.046 --> 14:44.106
Well, I should have
a few words to say...

14:44.283 --> 14:46.148
...but on reflection...

14:46.318 --> 14:47.808
...what can one say?

14:47.987 --> 14:50.182
Ladies and gentlemen.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.214
Mercury.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.852
Twenty-three hours ago,
on the comms systems...

16:33.025 --> 16:34.720
While listening to your space music?

16:34.893 --> 16:38.329
- While scanning the frequencies,
I heard a transmission.

16:39.865 --> 16:42.527
It appeared as we flew
into the dark side of Mercury.

16:42.701 --> 16:44.362
The iron content of the planet...

16:44.536 --> 16:45.901
...is acting as an antenna.

16:46.071 --> 16:49.563
There's high background interference,
but the signal is clear enough.

16:49.742 --> 16:53.542
<i>Icarus, please play audio file 7-5/B.</i>

16:53.712 --> 16:55.805
<i>Yes, Harvey.</i>

17:12.397 --> 17:13.422
End file.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.027
What is it?

17:16.635 --> 17:18.397
<i>It's the Icarus I.</i>

17:20.138 --> 17:22.107
That signal is their distress beacon.

17:22.273 --> 17:23.570
Jesus.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.800
That's impossible.
It's been seven years.

17:25.978 --> 17:28.571
Clearly it's not impossible
because you can hear it.

17:28.747 --> 17:30.772
- They're still alive?
- We don't know.

17:30.949 --> 17:33.144
But they could be.
Oxygen is self-replenishing.

17:33.352 --> 17:34.910
Water is recycled.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.884
They have the solar power
they need.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.752
What about food?
Their supplies couldn't last.

17:39.925 --> 17:41.290
That depends.

17:41.460 --> 17:44.088
They had stock to cover eight people
for three years.

17:44.263 --> 17:46.163
That's a four-year shortfall.
Hell of a diet.

17:46.365 --> 17:48.333
<i>We don't know what happened
to Icarus I.</i>

17:48.500 --> 17:50.627
There might have been an accident.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.998
There might not have been
eight people to feed.

17:53.172 --> 17:57.131
- Captain, do we know where they are?
- Well done, Capa. That is the question.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.908
<i>Icarus.</i>

18:00.379 --> 18:03.940
Please plot our trajectory following
the slingshot around Mercury.

18:04.116 --> 18:06.084
<i>Yes, captain.</i>

18:08.487 --> 18:12.082
<i>Now plot the source
of the Icarus I beacon.</i>

18:17.296 --> 18:19.264
Jesus. They almost made it.

18:19.431 --> 18:21.899
That's why no one picked up
the signal until now.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.196
It was lost in the background light
and noise.

18:25.404 --> 18:26.871
We're gonna pass right by them.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.372
Within 10 or 15 thousand miles.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.533
Can anyone survive?

18:32.711 --> 18:35.271
If the shield is intact.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.707
We'll be able to see them?

18:38.684 --> 18:40.049
Yes.

18:40.219 --> 18:44.155
I'd need to look at all of this
pretty carefully. Very carefully.

18:44.323 --> 18:49.556
But if I had to make a guess right now,
I'd say we could adjust our trajectory.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.452
We could fly straight to them.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.188
But we're not gonna do that.

18:56.702 --> 19:00.638
Just to make it absolutely clear,
there's no way we're gonna do that.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.234
Do I have to spell it out for you?

19:06.445 --> 19:09.380
We have a payload to deliver
to the heart of our nearest star.

19:09.548 --> 19:11.982
We're doing it
because that star is dying.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.016
And if it dies, we die.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.517
Everything dies.

19:15.687 --> 19:17.484
So that is our mission.
There is nothing...

19:17.656 --> 19:21.422
...literally nothing, more important than
completing our mission. End of story.

19:21.593 --> 19:24.061
- He's right.
- He's right. Of course I'm right.

19:24.229 --> 19:26.527
Is anyone here seriously
considering otherwise?

19:26.698 --> 19:28.393
- May I put a counter argument?
- No.

19:28.567 --> 19:29.932
Captain?

19:30.102 --> 19:31.228
Go ahead.

19:32.004 --> 19:34.097
It would, of course...

19:34.273 --> 19:38.710
<i>...be absurd to alter our trajectory
to assist the crew of the Icarus I.</i>

19:38.877 --> 19:42.244
Even if we knew that some or
even all of that crew are still alive...

19:42.748 --> 19:47.776
...their lives are expendable
when seen in the context of our mission.

19:48.921 --> 19:49.945
As are our own lives.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.714
- Exactly.
- However...

19:52.624 --> 19:56.116
<i>...there is something onboard the
Icarus I that may be worth the detour.</i>

19:56.295 --> 19:58.923
As you pointed out, Mace,
we have a payload to deliver.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.121
A payload. Singular.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.860
Now, everything about the delivery
and effectiveness of that payload...

20:04.069 --> 20:06.594
...is entirely theoretical.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.433
Simply put...

20:08.607 --> 20:10.973
...we don't know if it's gonna work.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.374
But what we do know is this...

20:14.713 --> 20:17.910
...if we had two bombs,
we'd have two chances.

20:18.083 --> 20:20.950
<i>You're assuming
we'd be able to pilot Icarus I.</i>

20:21.119 --> 20:22.143
- Yes.
- Which is assuming...

20:22.321 --> 20:26.781
...that whatever stopped them wasn't
a fault or a damage to the spacecraft.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.927
- Yes.
- It's a lot of assumptions.

20:29.094 --> 20:30.118
It is.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.592
It's a risk assessment.

20:31.763 --> 20:32.787
The question is:

20:32.965 --> 20:36.901
Does the risk of a detour outweigh
the benefits of an extra payload?

20:46.111 --> 20:47.442
- We'll have a vote.
- No, no.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.277
No, we won't.

20:50.482 --> 20:52.109
We are not a democracy.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.653
We're a collection of astronauts
and scientists.

20:56.822 --> 21:00.280
So we're gonna make the most
informed decision available to us.

21:00.459 --> 21:01.756
Made by you, by any chance?

21:01.927 --> 21:05.124
Made by the person best qualified
to understand the complexities...

21:05.297 --> 21:07.265
...of a payload delivery.

21:07.699 --> 21:09.166
Our physicist.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.836
Shit.

21:23.782 --> 21:28.219
<i>Okay, Icarus, run the math on the
successful delivery of the payload.</i>

21:28.387 --> 21:30.719
<i>Okay, payload delivery point reached.</i>

21:30.889 --> 21:32.015
Detach the payload.

21:32.591 --> 21:35.617
<i>Stellar bomb initiated and detached.</i>

21:35.794 --> 21:38.228
<i>Crew and living section
have four minutes...</i>

21:38.397 --> 21:41.230
<i>...to clear and commence
homeward journey.</i>

21:41.667 --> 21:46.229
And four minutes after separation,
boosters automatically fire.

21:46.405 --> 21:51.172
<i>Payload boosters will automatically
fire after four-minute delay.</i>

21:51.343 --> 21:53.834
<i>Entering coronal hole
in South Polar Cap.</i>

21:54.012 --> 21:55.673
<i>Magnetic field structure open.</i>

21:55.847 --> 21:58.407
<i>Temperature, 37,000.</i>

21:58.617 --> 22:02.314
<i>Reliability of projection has dropped
below 45 percent.</i>

22:02.487 --> 22:06.014
<i>Remaining projection is not open
to useful speculation.</i>

22:06.191 --> 22:07.749
<i>Variables infinite.</i>

22:07.926 --> 22:09.257
<i>Accuracy unknown.</i>

22:09.428 --> 22:11.055
That's the problem right there.

22:11.229 --> 22:13.595
Between the boosters
and the gravity of the sun...

22:13.765 --> 22:15.596
...the velocity will be so great...

22:15.767 --> 22:18.099
...space and time
will become smeared together.

22:18.270 --> 22:21.398
Everything will distort,
everything will be unquantifiable.

22:21.573 --> 22:24.371
You have to come down on one side
or the other.

22:24.676 --> 22:28.544
- I need a decision.
- It's not a decision, it's a guess.

22:28.880 --> 22:33.078
It's like flipping a coin and asking me
to decide whether it'll be heads or tails.

22:34.019 --> 22:35.577
And?

22:36.688 --> 22:38.053
Heads.

22:43.061 --> 22:46.519
We've mined all Earth's fissile
materials for this bomb.

22:46.932 --> 22:49.560
There's not gonna be
another payload.

22:51.169 --> 22:53.967
The one we carry is our last chance.

22:54.172 --> 22:57.903
Our last best hope.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.871
Searle's argument is sound.

23:04.216 --> 23:06.184
Two last hopes are better than one.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.687
That's it.

23:26.705 --> 23:28.297
<i>Slingshot complete.</i>

23:28.473 --> 23:31.601
<i>Icarus leaving Mercury orbit.</i>

23:59.938 --> 24:00.996
Hey.

24:01.173 --> 24:03.004
Hey.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.043
Good dream?

24:11.183 --> 24:12.514
Let me guess.

24:12.851 --> 24:14.819
The surface of the sun?

24:16.822 --> 24:18.756
Only dream I ever have.

24:19.391 --> 24:22.690
Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.

24:24.362 --> 24:26.990
Maybe you should talk
to Dr. Searle about that.

24:27.666 --> 24:30.260
See if he can help you out.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.500
Maybe.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.409
I just wanted to let you know...

24:41.012 --> 24:43.537
...I think you made the right decision.

24:44.716 --> 24:46.183
Well.

24:48.420 --> 24:53.221
Mace doesn't and I'm guessing Harvey
and Trey don't either.

24:53.391 --> 24:54.858
Yeah...

24:55.293 --> 24:57.022
...but I do.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.789
- Get the alarm. What's going on?
- I screwed up.

25:25.957 --> 25:27.891
It's not you. It's my responsibility.

25:28.059 --> 25:30.289
- We shouldn't be straying.
- Trey, cut to it.

25:30.462 --> 25:33.898
<i>In order to change the route,
I had to manually override Icarus.</i>

25:34.065 --> 25:37.728
So I made all the calculations myself.
And I double- and triple-checked them.

25:37.903 --> 25:39.097
They all worked out.

25:39.271 --> 25:42.240
So I set the new coordinates
and put us on our way.

25:42.407 --> 25:44.602
What's the problem?
The trajectory is wrong?

25:44.776 --> 25:46.038
The trajectory is good.

25:46.645 --> 25:50.877
But it changes our angle of approach
to the sun by 1.1 degrees.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.847
You didn't reset the shields
to the new angle.

25:57.088 --> 25:59.420
Jesus Christ, Trey.

25:59.891 --> 26:01.756
I forgot.

26:04.596 --> 26:09.761
My head was full of velocities and fuel
calculations and a million different...

26:09.935 --> 26:12.733
I fucked up, all right?

26:14.506 --> 26:16.235
People do shit.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.137
They get stressed...

26:19.010 --> 26:20.944
...and fuck up.

26:21.746 --> 26:22.974
I fucked up.

26:23.148 --> 26:24.979
Trey.

26:29.821 --> 26:32.813
The fact is, we're still alive.

26:33.959 --> 26:36.484
A hole hasn't burnt
in the side of the ship.

26:36.661 --> 26:38.788
We don't have
a 10,000-degree climate.

26:38.964 --> 26:41.831
- So, what's the actual damage?
- We don't know.

26:42.000 --> 26:45.527
<i>Icarus tried to reset the shields
independently when the alarm triggered.</i>

26:45.704 --> 26:47.797
But all the sensors up there are
burned out.

26:47.973 --> 26:50.533
So we have no idea of the state
of the affected area.

26:51.476 --> 26:54.104
Only way we're gonna know
is if we go out there.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.304
Okay.

26:57.482 --> 26:59.313
I'll get suited up.

26:59.484 --> 27:01.384
It's a two-man job.

27:01.553 --> 27:04.147
As second in command,
you're not going anywhere.

27:04.322 --> 27:06.313
- I volunteer.
- No, I volunteer.

27:07.125 --> 27:08.217
Fine.

27:08.426 --> 27:10.553
I volunteer Capa.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.231
Sure.

27:16.434 --> 27:17.799
I'll do it.

27:19.871 --> 27:21.429
Okay.

27:47.032 --> 27:48.397
Okay.

28:27.739 --> 28:30.765
You've done this a thousand times
in Earth-orbit training.

28:31.576 --> 28:33.043
Yeah.

28:33.211 --> 28:34.940
You're gonna be fine.

28:35.113 --> 28:36.137
Okay?

28:48.727 --> 28:49.751
<i>Okay, Icarus.</i>

28:49.928 --> 28:51.919
I'm gonna be taking
control for a while.

28:52.097 --> 28:54.395
<i>- Okay, Cassie.
- I'm gonna be cutting speed.</i>

28:54.566 --> 28:57.558
I'm gonna rotate us so the damage
is facing away from the sun.

28:57.736 --> 29:00.068
<i>- Do we understand each other?
- Yes, Cassie.</i>

29:00.238 --> 29:03.401
Rotate by that much, we're gonna
lose comm towers three and four.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.066
Well, it's a good thing
we don't need them, then.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.940
We don't need them now,
we're gonna need them to go home.

29:09.114 --> 29:11.139
We'll cross that bridge when
we come to it.

29:11.316 --> 29:14.945
In the meantime, I'm gonna try and
give them as much shadow as I can.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.280
All right, guys.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.183
I'm opening up.

29:50.455 --> 29:52.389
Okay.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.453
<i>Helmet-cam operational.</i>

30:00.632 --> 30:02.395
<i>Affirmative. Good image.</i>

30:04.836 --> 30:06.827
Capa, check,
helmet-cam fully operational.

30:07.005 --> 30:08.666
<i>Affirmative.</i>

30:12.544 --> 30:15.877
<i>Exiting airlock with maintenance
modules.</i>

30:29.561 --> 30:33.429
Moving down
to investigate damaged area.

30:34.265 --> 30:36.165
Okay, guys.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.029
Nice and easy.

30:39.003 --> 30:40.766
<i>Nice and easy.</i>

30:40.939 --> 30:42.702
<i>Copy.</i>

30:55.186 --> 30:58.212
<i>Icarus, please adjust shield
to allow for rotation.</i>

30:58.423 --> 31:00.550
<i>Yes, Cassie.</i>

31:28.753 --> 31:31.187
<i>Establishing new alignment to sun.</i>

31:33.791 --> 31:35.418
Jesus.

31:35.593 --> 31:37.720
That's the temperature change
on the shields.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.421
The metal's just contracting
and expanding.

31:40.598 --> 31:43.260
I know what it is, flyboy.

31:51.609 --> 31:54.442
It sounds like she's tearing apart.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.467
<i>Fatal damage to Comms Towers
3 and 4.</i>

32:19.637 --> 32:22.970
<i>Copy, Icarus. Loss of towers
3 and 4. Cancel alarm.</i>

32:23.141 --> 32:26.304
Shut down sensor
to Comms Tower 3 and 4.

32:36.020 --> 32:39.046
<i>You should see it up here, guys.</i>

32:39.958 --> 32:42.153
<i>It's pretty impressive.</i>

32:53.905 --> 32:55.372
<i>Okay.</i>

32:55.540 --> 32:58.509
<i>There are four damaged panels.</i>

33:01.479 --> 33:04.414
<i>They're about 300 meters out.</i>

33:17.161 --> 33:20.426
Capa, take it easy. You're going
through your O2 pretty fast.

33:22.233 --> 33:24.326
Copy that, Cory.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.670
That's it.
Slow down the breathing.

33:31.843 --> 33:33.834
Relaxed movement.

33:53.731 --> 33:56.097
<i>Approaching the first panel.</i>

34:18.889 --> 34:20.118
<i>We were lucky.</i>

34:20.291 --> 34:22.589
<i>Can you guys see this?</i>

34:22.760 --> 34:23.818
<i>We can see it.</i>

34:23.995 --> 34:26.395
The hydraulics are burnt out.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.862
<i>Let's get this closed.</i>

34:50.388 --> 34:52.379
Okay, Mace.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.882
That's it.

34:58.463 --> 35:00.090
That's the first one closed.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.856
You can do it?

35:02.033 --> 35:03.330
<i>It'll take a while, but...</i>

35:04.602 --> 35:06.263
Yeah.

35:07.038 --> 35:08.096
We can do it.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.906
Great job.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.508
<i>Lots of smiling faces
in this room, guys.</i>

35:21.719 --> 35:23.687
<i>- Great job.
- I love you, captain.</i>

35:33.297 --> 35:35.561
<i>Moving to next panel.</i>

35:58.222 --> 35:59.746
Hey.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.384
Don't kill yourself, man.
We got this, okay?

36:06.397 --> 36:07.659
What's going on, guys?

36:08.166 --> 36:09.326
<i>The ship's moving.</i>

36:09.500 --> 36:11.229
We're venting O2. Shit.

36:11.402 --> 36:12.835
I think we're venting O2.

- Sealing sector. Sealing feed.

36:50.308 --> 36:53.243
- Seal sections five through nine.
- Sealing five through nine.

36:56.414 --> 36:58.439
Kaneda, Capa,
get back to the airlock now.

36:58.616 --> 37:00.015
Can't.

37:01.285 --> 37:03.719
<i>Can't leave upright panels.</i>

<i>The ship will burn up if the shields

37:07.291 --> 37:08.622

38:45.189 --> 38:47.555
Lt'll cause a flashover.
Make it burn itself out.

38:47.725 --> 38:49.317

39:03.207 --> 39:04.936
No.

39:21.292 --> 39:24.921
<i>Eighty-nine percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

39:43.414 --> 39:46.110
<i>Capa, go back.</i>

39:46.384 --> 39:48.284
<i>I'll finish this.</i>

39:48.452 --> 39:49.476
Please, I can do this.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.781
Go.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.301
Capa returning to airlock.

40:04.468 --> 40:05.833
Do you copy?

40:08.005 --> 40:11.133
<i>Capa returning to airlock.
Do you copy?</i>

40:11.308 --> 40:14.072
<i>Copy, Capa. Hurry.</i>

40:15.413 --> 40:18.974
<i>Ninety-one percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

40:43.374 --> 40:47.105
<i>Ninety-four percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

40:52.750 --> 40:56.652
Captain? Captain?
I'm at the edge of the shield.

40:57.154 --> 40:58.746
<i>Do you copy?</i>

40:59.190 --> 41:01.658
Captain, you must leave now.
Captain?

41:01.826 --> 41:05.125
<i>Ninety-seven percent of shield
in full sunlight.</i>

41:05.296 --> 41:08.356
Final panel closing.
The shield is secure.

41:08.532 --> 41:09.863
You have to move now.

41:10.034 --> 41:12.525
<i>Captain, it's right on you.</i>

41:12.703 --> 41:15.228
<i>- Kaneda's not gonna make it.
- You have to move.</i>

41:15.406 --> 41:17.374
<i>You have to move now.</i>

41:17.541 --> 41:18.633
It's too far.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.271
<i>Captain, move.</i>

41:23.848 --> 41:25.372
<i>Why isn't he moving?</i>

41:26.350 --> 41:27.510
<i>Kaneda.</i>

41:27.685 --> 41:29.243
What do you see?

41:29.420 --> 41:31.752
<i>Searle, tell our captain to move.</i>

41:31.922 --> 41:35.016
Kaneda, what can you see?

41:35.192 --> 41:36.989
<i>Searle, do you copy?</i>

41:53.043 --> 41:54.305
Kaneda?

42:25.409 --> 42:28.242
<i>Shield rotation complete.</i>

42:54.305 --> 42:56.273
The breakdown is as follows.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.271
Trey is sedated in the Med Centre.

42:58.442 --> 43:01.104
Dr. Searle has diagnosed him
as a suicide risk.

43:02.646 --> 43:05.581
I don't think any of us
are about to question that diagnosis.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.515
<i>As second in command,
I am now the captain of Icarus II.</i>

43:09.687 --> 43:12.019
Thanks both to Kaneda...

43:12.189 --> 43:15.249
...and Capa, our shields are intact.

43:15.426 --> 43:17.690
As is the payload.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.631
But the oxygen garden
is totally destroyed.

43:22.099 --> 43:25.967
In addition, a large amount of O2
was burned in the fire.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.703
As it stands now...

43:28.839 --> 43:33.469
...we don't have enough oxygen reserves
to get us to our payload delivery point.

43:35.145 --> 43:37.477
Let alone to survive
the return journey.

43:37.648 --> 43:40.481
So cancel the ticker-tape parade.

43:43.821 --> 43:47.917
<i>We now have no choice
but to rendezvous with Icarus I.</i>

43:48.859 --> 43:51.293
If we're gonna complete
the mission...

43:51.462 --> 43:54.158
<i>...the Icarus I is our only hope.</i>

44:06.243 --> 44:08.871
Technically, he made a mistake.

44:09.046 --> 44:10.638
What are you trying to say, Cory?

44:10.814 --> 44:14.477
Harvey said there's not enough oxygen
to get us to the delivery point.

44:14.652 --> 44:16.677
But there is.

44:17.988 --> 44:21.583
There just isn't enough oxygen
to get all of us there.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.155
Are you suggesting
we let Trey kill himself?

44:25.329 --> 44:26.887
No.

44:27.965 --> 44:30.092
And in any case...

44:30.601 --> 44:33.092
...Trey wouldn't be enough.

44:34.204 --> 44:36.502
We need to lose two more.

44:41.979 --> 44:45.073
Three out of seven.
That's a lot of short straws.

45:26.423 --> 45:28.721
<i>Capa, it's me.</i>

45:34.298 --> 45:35.890
It's different.

45:36.066 --> 45:39.229
Being afraid
that you won't make it back home.

45:39.903 --> 45:43.600
And then knowing that you won't.

45:45.275 --> 45:48.267
<i>Our survival depends
on what we can salvage from Icarus I.</i>

45:48.445 --> 45:49.969
No.

45:51.348 --> 45:52.576
We're gonna die out here.

45:53.550 --> 45:55.677
Like the other crew.

45:56.086 --> 45:57.815
I know it.

45:59.857 --> 46:01.552
So do you.

46:05.162 --> 46:06.254
Are you scared?

46:15.305 --> 46:17.364
When the stellar bomb is triggered...

46:18.575 --> 46:21.169
...very little will happen at first.

46:21.512 --> 46:24.538
<i>And then a spark
will pop into existence...</i>

46:24.715 --> 46:28.583
<i>...and it will hang for an instant,
hovering in space. And then...</i>

46:30.020 --> 46:32.011
...it will split into two.

46:32.189 --> 46:33.884
And those will split again...

46:34.091 --> 46:35.956
...and again and again.

46:40.230 --> 46:42.323
Detonation beyond all imagining.

46:44.334 --> 46:45.961
A big bang on a small scale.

46:46.136 --> 46:48.104
A new star born out of a dying one.

46:50.340 --> 46:52.467
I think it'll be beautiful.

46:53.544 --> 46:55.603
No. I'm not scared.

47:00.717 --> 47:02.309
I am.

47:50.934 --> 47:53.528
<i>Searle, Capa, they're waiting for you.</i>

47:53.704 --> 47:55.729
Okay, let's go.

49:42.346 --> 49:44.871
Be careful, watch your step.

49:49.286 --> 49:51.311
Cassie, are you getting this
on the feed?

49:51.488 --> 49:52.978
<i>Getting what?</i>

49:53.523 --> 49:56.822
The air. It's full of dust.

49:56.994 --> 49:58.655
Human skin.

49:58.829 --> 49:59.921
What?

50:00.097 --> 50:03.362
Eighty percent of all dust
is human skin.

50:08.305 --> 50:10.000
Sorry.

50:14.611 --> 50:16.044
- No lights?
- No.

50:16.213 --> 50:17.441
No surprise.

50:18.949 --> 50:21.417
Anyone afraid of the dark?

50:22.319 --> 50:23.343
We should split up.

50:23.520 --> 50:26.114
I'm not sure that's such a good idea.

50:26.623 --> 50:27.954
Yeah, probably right.

50:28.125 --> 50:31.288
Might get picked off one at a time
by aliens.

50:31.461 --> 50:34.897
<i>Icarus I is a big ship. We can't search it
effectively in one group.</i>

50:35.065 --> 50:37.465
Okay. You're right.

50:38.835 --> 50:42.032
Mace, head up for the Flight Deck,
see if you can't get her to fly.

50:43.940 --> 50:46.704
Searle, check the social area
and the sleeping quarters.

50:46.877 --> 50:48.742
Capa, aim for the payload.

50:50.280 --> 50:52.475
I'll check the garden.

50:52.749 --> 50:55.377
Let's keep in contact, guys.

51:33.156 --> 51:35.522
Listen up, everybody.

51:36.126 --> 51:39.755
You gotta see this.
Seven years of unchecked growth.

51:41.331 --> 51:43.322
<i>Can you see this?</i>

51:43.633 --> 51:46.761
<i>It's an ecosystem working beautifully
after all this time.</i>

51:46.937 --> 51:49.167
You seeing this readout,
O2, everybody.

51:50.107 --> 51:51.131
It's wonderful.

51:51.608 --> 51:52.632
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

51:52.809 --> 51:54.709
<i>Cory, look at the ferns.</i>

52:10.827 --> 52:12.988
That's strange.

52:13.430 --> 52:15.990
Subsystems are fine.
Solar harvest is fine.

52:16.166 --> 52:20.068
The ship should be running except I'm
getting nothing from the flight computer.

52:27.077 --> 52:28.135
Got water.

52:32.082 --> 52:33.572
Food.

52:39.756 --> 52:41.485
No crew.

52:42.092 --> 52:43.218
No bodies.

52:50.834 --> 52:52.665
My God.

52:53.737 --> 52:56.171
You can hardly walk, it's so thick.

52:59.843 --> 53:02.835
<i>I am Pinbacker.</i>

53:04.748 --> 53:07.046
<i>Commander of the Icarus I.</i>

53:10.787 --> 53:13.551
<i>We have abandoned our mission.</i>

53:14.724 --> 53:17.522
<i>Our star is dying.</i>

53:19.062 --> 53:21.553
<i>All our science...</i>

53:23.099 --> 53:25.363
<i>...all our hopes...</i>

53:26.770 --> 53:30.365
<i>...our dreams, are foolish.</i>

53:31.141 --> 53:33.405
<i>In the face of this...</i>

53:34.244 --> 53:35.939
<i>...we are...</i>

53:36.713 --> 53:40.410
<i>...dust. Nothing more.</i>

53:40.884 --> 53:45.787
<i>And to this dust, we will return.</i>

53:49.059 --> 53:54.929
<i>When he chooses for us to die.</i>

53:55.098 --> 53:57.328
<i>It is not our place...</i>

53:58.335 --> 54:01.099
<i>...to challenge God.</i>

54:05.075 --> 54:06.975
Okay, that make sense to anyone?

54:07.143 --> 54:10.601
Transmission code is six
and a half years ago.

54:12.682 --> 54:15.082
<i>That would be after they entered
the non-com zone.</i>

54:16.052 --> 54:19.249
That should be the time they
were supposed to deliver the payload.

54:36.072 --> 54:38.632
<i>Payload is fully operational.</i>

54:38.808 --> 54:40.002
Say again, Capa?

54:40.176 --> 54:42.872
The payload is fully operational.
It's A-okay.

54:44.881 --> 54:47.850
That's great news.
Looks like we got what we came for.

54:48.018 --> 54:49.645
No, we don't.

54:49.819 --> 54:51.377
<i>Go ahead, Mace?</i>

54:51.588 --> 54:54.022
I know what caused
the distress signal.

54:54.491 --> 54:57.722
<i>There's a coolant failure of some kind.
The bottom line is...</i>

54:57.894 --> 55:00.795
<i>...it doesn't matter that Capa
has his payload.</i>

55:00.964 --> 55:03.398
<i>Without the mainframe, we can't fly.</i>

55:04.801 --> 55:06.996
<i>It's been sabotaged.</i>

55:10.407 --> 55:12.637
We should never have
gone off the mission.

55:30.694 --> 55:32.855
I have something to say.

55:34.664 --> 55:35.722
Found the crew.

55:57.287 --> 55:59.050
What happened?

56:00.924 --> 56:02.516
They had an epiphany.

56:03.526 --> 56:04.584
They saw the light.

56:05.695 --> 56:07.686
They burned themselves.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.195
No shit.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.733
I suspect the observation filter
is fully open.

56:12.902 --> 56:18.204
<i>If we weren't behind the screen
of Icarus II, we'd join them.</i>

56:18.775 --> 56:20.174
Ashes to ashes.

56:22.445 --> 56:24.538
Stardust to stardust.

56:25.482 --> 56:26.540
<i>Icarus!</i>

56:31.888 --> 56:33.412
<i>Icarus. Stabilizers.</i>

56:39.829 --> 56:42.730
- What was that?
- Guys, get back to the airlock, now.

56:48.138 --> 56:49.765
<i>We have a major incident.</i>

56:49.939 --> 56:51.736
<i>We are floating free from you.</i>

56:51.908 --> 56:53.637
<i>Repeat, we are floating free.</i>

56:54.344 --> 56:55.743
<i>All crew back to the airlock.</i>

57:08.224 --> 57:09.851
<i>- Cassie.
- The airlock has decoupled.</i>

57:10.026 --> 57:11.584
<i>We don't know why.</i>

57:11.761 --> 57:14.423
<i>The locking system on Icarus I
is totally ripped open.</i>

57:14.597 --> 57:17.794
I can hold our position but we aren't
gonna be able to dock again.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.298
<i>There's another thing, guys.</i>

57:19.469 --> 57:22.336
<i>You've got a breach, I can see it.
You're losing atmosphere.</i>

57:23.106 --> 57:24.130
We're screwed.

57:25.141 --> 57:26.165
No, we're not.

57:32.682 --> 57:34.240
One of us isn't, anyway.

57:52.469 --> 57:53.493
What happened?

57:53.670 --> 57:56.662
Airlock's destroyed.
There's only one suit. Capa's taking it.

58:05.215 --> 58:07.649
- Why Capa?
- The rest of us are lower priority.

58:07.817 --> 58:09.216
I'm not a low priority.

58:09.385 --> 58:12.218
You're a comms officer on a ship
that has no communication.

58:12.388 --> 58:13.548
I am the captain.

58:14.524 --> 58:16.788
The mission needs a captain
to hold it together.

58:18.061 --> 58:21.895
<i>Harvey, Capa's the only person outside
of Icarus who can operate the payload.</i>

58:22.398 --> 58:23.490
There is no choice.

58:23.666 --> 58:25.190
No, there's no choice for you.

58:25.368 --> 58:28.201
Capa, I order you to remove that suit.

58:31.541 --> 58:33.406
Get out of the suit.

58:36.746 --> 58:39.738
That is a direct order.

58:42.452 --> 58:47.219
<i>I assure you, when I'm onboard Icarus II
that I'll do everything within my power...</i>

58:47.390 --> 58:49.950
To what?
Shuttle back with more suits?

58:50.126 --> 58:51.684
The airlock is ripped in half.

58:51.861 --> 58:55.558
Once we break that seal,
how are we gonna re-pressurize?

59:02.238 --> 59:03.705
Cassie.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.873
Go.

59:06.042 --> 59:09.034
<i>Listen. We can't depressurize
when we open the airlock.</i>

59:09.212 --> 59:12.079
<i>So the force of the gas
is gonna fire him out, right?</i>

59:12.615 --> 59:13.639
Right.

59:13.850 --> 59:17.149
<i>If you open your airlock and
we line it up right, he'll fire inside.</i>

59:19.088 --> 59:20.112
And so will we.

59:23.459 --> 59:24.483
Without suits?

59:26.062 --> 59:28.792
- Get as close as you can.
- You'll have 20 meters to cover.

59:28.965 --> 59:31.593
At minus 273 degrees Celsius.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.567
It's gonna be cold.

59:36.005 --> 59:37.905
But we'll make it.

59:40.410 --> 59:42.105
Anyone got any better ideas?

59:47.317 --> 59:48.648
Copy that.

01:00:05.168 --> 01:00:06.829
Mace.

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.268
One problem.

01:00:09.806 --> 01:00:11.774
The computer's down.

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:15.502
One of us has to manually
operate the seal.

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:17.677
From inside.

01:00:18.715 --> 01:00:20.842
Shit.

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.849
You're right.

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:29.048
So, whatever happens,
one of us is staying behind.

01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:34.186
I see. I get it.

01:00:34.364 --> 01:00:37.697
It's me.
That's what you're all thinking?

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.860
No, Harvey.

01:00:42.038 --> 01:00:43.062
It's me.

01:01:03.993 --> 01:01:05.517
You okay?

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.588
Hey, Capa.

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:10.590
We're only stardust.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:25.740
<i>Mace, we're lined up.</i>

01:01:25.915 --> 01:01:28.042
<i>Everything's set.</i>

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.614
Searle, are you ready?

01:01:37.593 --> 01:01:40.687
All right.
We only got one shot at this.

01:01:40.863 --> 01:01:41.887
Cassie.

01:01:42.498 --> 01:01:44.295
<i>- Are you ready?
- Ready.</i>

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:48.197
Harvey, keep your eyes shut
and exhale slowly.

01:01:48.371 --> 01:01:49.497
Copy.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:55.110
Let's do it.

01:02:41.924 --> 01:02:43.585
<i>Crew detected in airlock.</i>

01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.290
<i>Recommend sealing
outer airlock door.</i>

01:02:46.462 --> 01:02:49.022
<i>I lost Harvey. I lost Harvey.</i>

01:02:49.198 --> 01:02:51.689
<i>- Harvey's gone.
- Crew detected in airlock.</i>

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.630
<i>Sealing outer airlock door.</i>

01:03:30.807 --> 01:03:32.206
Breathe, Mace. Just breathe.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:33.535
Get my hand. Get my hand.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:35.142
- Breathe, Mace.
- Capa?

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:38.144
You're okay, Mace. You're okay, Mace.
Please, breathe.

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:59.866
- Capa, are you all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:04:01.437 --> 01:04:03.337
Let's get you out of here.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.410
<i>Searle?</i>

01:04:48.217 --> 01:04:50.048
<i>We're leaving now.</i>

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.585
<i>We're gonna complete the mission.</i>

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.589
<i>We're all thinking of you, Searle.</i>

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:02.989
<i>Searle?</i>

01:05:04.066 --> 01:05:05.966
<i>We're gonna go now.</i>

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:12.835
<i>We love you.</i>

01:05:41.103 --> 01:05:43.663
<i>I've been through Icarus's activity file
and I checked it.</i>

01:05:43.839 --> 01:05:46.000
Double-checked it.
Cory triple-checked it.

01:05:46.175 --> 01:05:48.541
And it's the same results.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:53.309
<i>In other words, unless Icarus is deleting
her own files, she didn't do it.</i>

01:05:53.482 --> 01:05:56.610
And there was no malfunction
on the airlock hardware.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:06:00.244
Which means the airlock
was decoupled manually.

01:06:01.324 --> 01:06:03.519
Cassie and I were on the Flight Deck.

01:06:03.693 --> 01:06:05.684
And I was with Capa and Searle.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:09.689
And I think we can all assume
it wasn't Harvey.

01:06:10.166 --> 01:06:12.498
Which leaves one possibility.

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:15.128
Trey.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:17.966
Trey is so doped up
he can hardly walk or feed himself.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.837
He sleeps for 23 hours a day.
And he blames himself for everything.

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.569
- Why would he do it?
- We don't know.

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:27.510
The possibility remains that it was
him and we gotta take that seriously.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:29.014
By doping him up more?

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:34.247
This isn't just about the possibility
whether he sabotaged the airlock.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.687
There is something else too.

01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:44.390
When Searle and Harvey died,
we lost two breathers.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.158
If Trey dies...

01:06:48.204 --> 01:06:51.605
...we'll have the oxygen
to make it to the delivery point.

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:54.002
<i>At least now we know what happened
on Icarus I.</i>

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:57.441
- The same thing that's happening here.
- Fuck you, Capa.

01:06:57.613 --> 01:07:00.810
What are you trying to remind us of?
Our lost humanity?

01:07:06.188 --> 01:07:07.212
I'll do it.

01:07:09.025 --> 01:07:10.959
I'm not passing any bucks.

01:07:11.694 --> 01:07:13.457
Do it how?

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:17.192
That's between me and Trey.

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.869
We'll have a vote this time.
Unanimous decision required.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:26.535
So you know where I stand.

01:07:33.749 --> 01:07:34.773
And me.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.120
What are you asking?

01:07:40.790 --> 01:07:43.953
That we weigh the life of one
against the future of mankind?

01:07:48.731 --> 01:07:49.993
Kill him.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:52.291
Cassie?

01:07:56.305 --> 01:07:57.795
No.

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:04.440
- Cassie.
- I know the argument.

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:06.672
I know the logic.

01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:09.607
You're saying you need my vote.

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.276
I'm saying you can't have it.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.761
What do we do?

01:08:29.037 --> 01:08:31.165
Oh, God.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.703
I'm sorry, Cassie.

01:08:40.549 --> 01:08:43.040
You make it easy for him.

01:08:44.487 --> 01:08:46.216
Somehow.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:49.120
Find a kindness.

01:09:53.255 --> 01:09:54.984
Trey.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:01.356
<i>Everybody get here now.</i>

01:10:17.646 --> 01:10:18.704
He cut his wrists.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.076
He took responsibility.

01:10:24.587 --> 01:10:26.555
All these deaths.

01:10:26.722 --> 01:10:28.155
Kaneda.

01:10:28.324 --> 01:10:30.792
Searle. Harvey.

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.427
Trey.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:36.721
None of them would have happened
if you hadn't diverted the mission.

01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:41.332
- What do you want me to say?
- I don't want you to say shit.

01:10:41.537 --> 01:10:44.665
I just want you to know that this...

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.831
...belongs here.

01:10:49.345 --> 01:10:50.972
Fuck you.

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:14.430
Air is low.
We need to limit our exertions.

01:11:48.203 --> 01:11:50.364
<i>- Icarus?
- Yes, Capa?</i>

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:53.167
Run an update on biometric signs
for all crew.

01:11:53.342 --> 01:11:55.833
Check oxygen consumption.

01:11:56.478 --> 01:11:58.139
<i>Checking.</i>

01:11:58.714 --> 01:12:00.409
Thank you.

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:03.546
<i>Capa.</i>

01:12:03.719 --> 01:12:05.516
<i>- Yes?
- You are dying.</i>

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.747
<i>All crew are dying.</i>

01:12:07.923 --> 01:12:09.754
We know we're dying.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:13.686
As long as we can live long enough
to deliver the payload...

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.056
...we're okay with it.

01:12:15.230 --> 01:12:17.824
<i>Capa, warning.</i>

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.935
<i>You will not live long enough
to deliver the payload.</i>

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.764
Please clarify.

01:12:25.941 --> 01:12:29.707
<i>Twelve hours before crew will be unable
to perform complex tasks.</i>

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:33.541
<i>Fourteen hours before crew will
be unable to perform basic tasks.</i>

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.513
<i>Sixteen hours until death.</i>

01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.174
<i>Journey time to delivery point:</i>

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:39.753
<i>- Nineteen hours.
- Impossible. Corazon was certain.</i>

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:42.254
We have remaining oxygen
to keep four crew alive.

01:12:42.424 --> 01:12:45.359
<i>Affirmative. Four crew could
survive on current reserves...</i>

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.893
Trey is dead.
There are only four crew members.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.087
<i>Negative.</i>

01:12:49.264 --> 01:12:52.199
<i>Affirmative, Icarus. Four crew:
Mace, Cassie, Corazon and me.</i>

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.393
<i>Five crew members.</i>

01:12:59.875 --> 01:13:01.399
<i>Icarus?</i>

01:13:01.577 --> 01:13:03.169
<i>Yes?</i>

01:13:05.681 --> 01:13:06.978
Who's the fifth crew member?

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:09.979
<i>Unknown.</i>

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.653
Where is the fifth crew member?

01:13:14.823 --> 01:13:17.621
<i>In the Observation Room.</i>

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.830
Are you an angel?

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:03.361
Has the time come?

01:14:07.042 --> 01:14:09.840
I've been waiting so long.

01:14:16.785 --> 01:14:18.514
Who are you?

01:14:20.289 --> 01:14:21.847
Who am I?

01:14:28.363 --> 01:14:30.763
At the end of time...

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.527
...a moment will come
when just one man remains.

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.071
Then the moment will pass.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:43.911
The man will be gone.

01:14:46.815 --> 01:14:50.581
There will be nothing to show
as if we were ever here...

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.987
...but stardust.

01:14:56.024 --> 01:15:00.688
The last man, alone with God.

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:06.156
Am I that man?

01:15:20.415 --> 01:15:22.042
My God.

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:28.079
My God, Pinbacker?

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.219
Not your God.

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:33.054
Mine.

01:15:46.742 --> 01:15:48.573
<i>Icarus. Full sunlight.</i>

01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:06.852
Anyone.

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.041
Oh, my God.

01:17:04.486 --> 01:17:05.510
<i>Icarus?</i>

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:15.225
<i>Warning, you do not have
authority to remove...</i>

01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:17.694
<i>...the mainframe panels
from the coolant.</i>

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:20.630
<i>Please return the panels
to the coolant.</i>

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:24.533
<i>I cannot locate
your biometric signs.</i>

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.005
<i>Please identify yourself.</i>

01:17:50.666 --> 01:17:53.396
You gotta be kidding.

01:18:10.252 --> 01:18:12.345
My God.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:22.597
A baby.

01:18:24.566 --> 01:18:26.193
A beautiful baby.

01:18:26.368 --> 01:18:28.859
<i>Icarus, patch me through to Mace.
I have something...</i>

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:30.561
...wonderful to show him.

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.230
Or Cassie or Capa.

01:18:34.042 --> 01:18:35.703
<i>Icarus?</i>

01:18:40.615 --> 01:18:42.515
Don't fight.

01:18:43.819 --> 01:18:45.719
Don't fight.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:19.648
Mace?

01:19:55.157 --> 01:19:56.283
Capa?

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:00.322
<i>Is anyone else getting silence
from Icarus?</i>

01:20:02.831 --> 01:20:04.799
Anybody?

01:20:19.915 --> 01:20:21.678
Capa?

01:20:51.179 --> 01:20:53.739
<i>Icarus, why are we in orbit?</i>

01:20:56.418 --> 01:20:57.646
Respond.

01:21:00.956 --> 01:21:02.014
What?

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.350
Jesus Christ.

01:21:04.092 --> 01:21:05.753
Capa? Capa?

01:21:09.464 --> 01:21:10.726
<i>In the suit.</i>

01:21:10.899 --> 01:21:12.366
<i>Use the hard link.</i>

01:21:12.534 --> 01:21:13.626
<i>In the helmet.</i>

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.394
Mace?

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.903
<i>- What the hell is going on?
- Mace?</i>

01:21:21.076 --> 01:21:22.771
<i>I can't talk to Icarus.</i>

01:21:22.944 --> 01:21:26.277
<i>Pinbacker is onboard.
He's trying to stop the mission.</i>

01:21:26.448 --> 01:21:29.281
<i>He's trying to destroy the mission.
He's insane.</i>

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:43.464
<i>Mace, listen.
I'm locked in the airlock.</i>

01:21:43.632 --> 01:21:46.567
Jesus Christ.
The mainframe is out of the coolant.

01:21:52.274 --> 01:21:53.832
The mechanism is disabled.

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.772
I can't lower the mainframe panels.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.809
Mace, repeat, please.

01:21:59.281 --> 01:22:01.340
<i>Icarus is gonna burn out.</i>

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:05.410
Mace.

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.315
<i>Mace, come in.</i>

01:24:34.402 --> 01:24:35.960
Come on.

01:24:40.809 --> 01:24:42.299
<i>Capa.</i>

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:43.501
<i>- Capa.
- Mace?</i>

01:24:44.245 --> 01:24:46.736
We're in orbit. The computer is down.

01:24:47.615 --> 01:24:50.778
<i>I don't know if I can get her
back online.</i>

01:24:50.952 --> 01:24:54.752
<i>You have to break us out
of orbit manually.</i>

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.481
<i>The only way to do that...</i>

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:59.627
...is separate the payload.
Do you get it, Capa?

01:24:59.794 --> 01:25:02.592
<i>Force the bomb into the sun.</i>

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:04.831
Separate the payload.

01:25:05.333 --> 01:25:09.861
You'll have to get to the bomb
and detonate manually.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.529
Unlock the airlock, do you copy?
Unlock the airlock.

01:25:13.108 --> 01:25:16.805
I don't know how, just do it.
Just do it.

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:19.639
<i>Okay.</i>

01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:22.346
<i>I'm gonna do this.</i>

01:25:23.218 --> 01:25:24.810
Copy, Mace.

01:25:26.287 --> 01:25:27.982
Copy.

01:26:24.846 --> 01:26:26.211
Capa.

01:26:26.381 --> 01:26:28.406
My leg.

01:26:42.564 --> 01:26:44.259
Oh, God.

01:26:51.639 --> 01:26:53.903
Do it, Capa.

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:00.604
Do it.

01:27:06.821 --> 01:27:07.879
Mace.

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.395
Come on.

01:32:49.096 --> 01:32:51.121
<i>Only dream I ever have.</i>

01:32:51.432 --> 01:32:52.899
<i>Is it the surface of the sun?</i>

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:57.635
<i>Every time I shut my eyes
it's always the same.</i>

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:01.354
Cassie?

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:11.462
Cassie?

01:35:11.639 --> 01:35:12.901
We're flying into the sun.

01:35:16.744 --> 01:35:18.905
Cassie, there's not much time.
I need to know.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.547
Where is he? Is he here?

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:30.888
For seven years I spoke with God.

01:35:38.299 --> 01:35:41.826
He told me to take us all to heaven.

01:35:48.542 --> 01:35:50.100
No.

01:36:33.687 --> 01:36:35.348
