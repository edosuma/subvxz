As some of you may know,

03:54.220 --> 03:55.630
we are approaching
the rainy season

03:55.830 --> 03:57.500
here in Li Tolqa.

03:57.700 --> 04:00.510
For the locals, this period
before the storms come

04:00.700 --> 04:03.640
is known as "Umbramaq,"
or "The Summoning."

04:03.840 --> 04:05.680
It is celebrated
with traditional music,

04:05.880 --> 04:09.380
and feasting, and of course,
good company.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.390
So, this morning,
I would like to welcome you all

04:12.590 --> 04:17.740
to Umbramaq and to anoint you
with the "fet yegga" pigment

04:17.940 --> 04:20.870
in the colors of the coast,
because it signifies

04:21.070 --> 04:22.610
that we are all bound
by friendship

04:22.810 --> 04:26.140
and we are closing out
the season together.

04:26.340 --> 04:28.920
Oh, and if any of you would like
to purchase "ekki" masks,

04:29.120 --> 04:31.580
they are still available
at the gift shop.

of the Tra-kla Island formations
this afternoon.

05:22.260 --> 05:23.630
I was thinking
we could go on that,

05:23.830 --> 05:27.720
and make reservations
in town for dinner.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.720
We could try the Chinese place.

05:29.920 --> 05:33.640

survive another dinner in town.

it's a real town?

a Chinese place?

making a statement.

One of the locals, I'd guess.

06:32.950 --> 06:35.490
What do you think
he's trying to say?

06:35.690 --> 06:37.230
[Gabi] He's saying that
he wants to put a long knife

06:37.430 --> 06:39.400
right through here.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.190
And after you die,

the other tourists.

I could convince you

07:43.320 --> 07:45.640
to join us for dinner
this evening?

around the resort

for a few days now and I would
love to get to know you.

tonight at Yangs.

I would say.

I can get you?

please have a great meal.

- [Ketch] And let me know anytime

if I can make your experience
even more enjoyable.

Interesting guy.

08:27.190 --> 08:28.640
[Alban] Yes.

08:28.840 --> 08:30.730
This is what is labeled
in the resort guide

08:30.930 --> 08:33.820
as a multicultural
dining experience.

08:34.020 --> 08:37.260
Well, it certainly
is an experience.

08:37.460 --> 08:40.180
So, Alban, what is it
you do for a living?

08:40.380 --> 08:42.830
Oh, architecture,
but I've mostly retired.

08:43.030 --> 08:46.310
Now I run a journal out of
Los Angeles called <i>Glass Pane.</i>

08:46.510 --> 08:47.490

I'm from London first,
then Paris.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.020
- We met there.
- That's how we met.

08:57.220 --> 08:58.670
[James] Oh.

08:58.870 --> 09:01.550
But I couldn't get work there,
so I made Alban move with me.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.760
And what do you do?

09:03.960 --> 09:07.120
Well, I'm an actress,
of course.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.940
- [James] Oh, really?
- She's great.

09:10.140 --> 09:11.770
- For commercials.
- [James] Okay.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.600
I have a contract
with an LA company.

09:13.800 --> 09:15.120
They've been grooming me.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.690
I specialize
in failing naturally.

09:18.890 --> 09:22.090
What does that mean?
"Failing naturally"?

09:22.290 --> 09:26.790
Finding a natural-seeming way
to fail at any given task.

09:26.990 --> 09:28.350
In each of the commercials
that I'm in,

09:28.550 --> 09:31.360
I'm the one who simply can't
go on without the product.

09:31.560 --> 09:34.580
It's ridiculous for me
to not have the product.

09:34.780 --> 09:35.840
Okay. [laughs]

09:36.040 --> 09:37.360
- Show them.
- No.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.150
- No, you should.
- [James chuckles] Yeah.

09:39.350 --> 09:40.280
Please.

09:40.480 --> 09:41.280
You wanna...?
Do you wanna see it?

09:41.480 --> 09:42.370
I wanna see.
I wanna see.

09:42.570 --> 09:43.710
Here.

It's impossible.

with a knife.

10:17.860 --> 10:18.670
- [Alban] No one.
- [James] No.

10:18.870 --> 10:21.450
No one. I need the BunChop.

10:21.650 --> 10:22.890
[Alban] Yeah.

10:23.090 --> 10:25.370
James, don't you need
the BunChop?

10:25.570 --> 10:26.410
[Alban] Yeah, you need it.

10:26.610 --> 10:27.540
Clearly.

10:27.740 --> 10:29.110
And see, each act of failure

10:29.310 --> 10:31.320
is a sort of mental
and physical puzzle.

10:35.110 --> 10:40.820
You know, I've been waiting
six years for your second book.

10:41.020 --> 10:42.990
[Alban] That's true.

10:43.190 --> 10:44.550
Is it coming out soon?

10:52.080 --> 10:53.650
We'll-- We'll see. [chuckles]

10:58.960 --> 11:00.620
Did I say something wrong?

11:00.820 --> 11:02.620
Oh, no, no. It's just he--
He hasn't been writing.

11:02.820 --> 11:03.620
No, no.

11:03.820 --> 11:06.540
No. I'm-- I'm working on it.

11:06.740 --> 11:09.890
[Alban] Hm, writer's block?

11:10.090 --> 11:12.810
Well, I'm starting to think
it might be the lack of talent.

11:13.010 --> 11:14.370
- [Alban] No. No.
- [Gabi] No.

11:14.570 --> 11:17.120
Don't say that. Please.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.080
I actually came here
looking for inspiration.

11:21.280 --> 11:26.170
To a-- To a resort.
It's quite pathetic.

11:26.370 --> 11:28.560
So, what do you do
for money then?

11:28.760 --> 11:30.220
Do you teach, or?

11:30.410 --> 11:31.960
- He married rich.
- [laughter]

11:32.160 --> 11:34.610
That's a good one.

11:34.810 --> 11:37.000
Well, it's good for an artist
to have a patron, isn't it?

11:37.200 --> 11:38.530
- [James] Yes... Yeah.
- [Em] Oh, sure.

11:38.730 --> 11:40.270
I'm in danger of becoming
a charitable organization

11:40.470 --> 11:44.090
at this point. [laughs]

[unsettling music playing]

12:51.420 --> 12:53.470
[James] What's wrong?

12:53.670 --> 12:54.950
[Em] No, I just...

12:55.150 --> 12:56.560
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.830
We barely know these people.

12:59.030 --> 13:00.090
[James]
We spent last night with them.

13:00.290 --> 13:01.830
[Em] You know what I mean.

13:02.030 --> 13:04.220
We're not supposed
to leave the resort strip.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.490
It's a poor country.
I know it's not their fault,

13:06.680 --> 13:07.830
but they have a high crime rate,

13:08.030 --> 13:10.660
and the guide says
they target foreigners.

13:10.860 --> 13:12.360
Well, maybe
a little therapeutic mugging

13:12.560 --> 13:13.880
could fix my back.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.500
Come on.

13:18.700 --> 13:22.240
I'm sure it's safe
if the Bauers are going.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.240
They come here every year.

13:25.440 --> 13:28.590
You're just happy
you found your fan club.

13:28.790 --> 13:31.600
Well, Em, you knew
it had to be somewhere.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.770
All right? It's one day.

13:34.970 --> 13:38.950
Let's mix things up a bit.
It'll be fun.

13:39.150 --> 13:41.430
[seagulls squawking]

to be especially careful...

13:45.990 --> 13:47.270
Hi!

13:47.460 --> 13:48.310
- [Em] Hi.
- [James] Hi.

13:48.510 --> 13:49.750
You made it.

13:49.950 --> 13:51.620
- [Em] Yeah.
- How are you?

13:51.820 --> 13:52.750
- [Em] Good.
- [James] Good. Good.

13:52.950 --> 13:53.920
Are you well?
You slept well?

13:54.120 --> 13:55.190
- [James] Yeah.
- [Gabi] Nice to see you.

13:55.390 --> 13:57.490
This is Mr. Thresh.

13:57.690 --> 14:00.230

to rent us his car for the day.

16:20.490 --> 16:23.460
do you want a buffalo sausage?

16:23.660 --> 16:26.860
No, if I ate another sausage,
I would vomit.

16:27.060 --> 16:28.820
Can you vomit first
and then eat one?

16:29.020 --> 16:30.250
They're coming out perfectly.

16:30.450 --> 16:33.340
[James chuckles]
Are you trying to kill me?

16:33.540 --> 16:35.870
I'm just fattening you
for dinner.

16:36.070 --> 16:38.130
You will be our final course.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.960
Once the oil starts
coming out of your eyes,

16:41.160 --> 16:43.960
I'll fry you with rosemary,

16:44.160 --> 16:47.010
and Em can eat your balls
like a real marriage.

16:47.210 --> 16:48.930
How do you know
I haven't already?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.750
[Alban] Look at him,
he's too disobedient.

16:51.950 --> 16:53.490
- Gab?
- [Gabi] Hm?

16:53.690 --> 16:55.320
[Alban] Do you want
a buffalo sausage, baby?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.800
No.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.940
[Alban] Also disobedient,

16:59.130 --> 17:02.240
and she doesn't even
have balls for us.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.990
So why this guy,
if you don't mind?

17:06.190 --> 17:09.860
He has no money. Why him?

17:10.060 --> 17:11.080
I don't know.

17:11.280 --> 17:15.470
Mm, I suppose
it has to be daddy issues.

17:15.670 --> 17:16.950
[Alban] Daddy issues?

17:17.150 --> 17:19.650
[Em chuckles]
Well, my father hates him.

17:19.850 --> 17:21.480
[Alban] Oh, come on, be serious.

17:21.680 --> 17:23.920
She is serious.

17:24.120 --> 17:26.570
[Em] My-- My father runs
a publishing house,

17:26.770 --> 17:27.920
and the one thing
that he told me

17:28.120 --> 17:30.010
was to never marry a writer.

17:30.210 --> 17:31.660
[Alban] Of course.

17:31.860 --> 17:33.360
But my father
was also a monster,

17:33.560 --> 17:36.150
so I married
the first broke writer

17:36.350 --> 17:38.020
to spill coffee on me.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.850
- [Alban] Really?
- [Em] Yeah.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.460
[both laugh]

17:42.660 --> 17:45.450
[James pissing]

17:55.770 --> 17:57.070
Almost done.

18:25.530 --> 18:28.360
[James moaning]

18:56.220 --> 18:59.130
[breathing heavily]

19:11.880 --> 19:14.710
[foreboding music playing]

19:53.270 --> 19:55.620
[Gabi] I'm sleeping
in the back with Em.

19:58.320 --> 19:59.330
[trunk closes]

19:59.530 --> 20:02.120
Fuck, I'm still drunk.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.820
[James] I can drive.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.030
[Alban] You sure?

20:06.230 --> 20:07.510
Yeah, I'm good.

20:07.710 --> 20:09.300
All right, thank you.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.680
[keys jingle]

20:19.950 --> 20:23.660
[Alban] Okay.

20:23.860 --> 20:26.610
[car engine starts, revving]

21:21.410 --> 21:24.280
[suspenseful music playing]

21:29.890 --> 21:31.290
Come on.

21:46.260 --> 21:47.830
- [shouts] No!
- [car window shatters]

21:48.030 --> 21:49.960
- [car tires screech]
- [body thudding]

21:55.440 --> 21:56.920
What the fuck was that?

21:58.920 --> 22:00.230
James?

22:04.410 --> 22:05.850
Stay in the car.

22:06.050 --> 22:09.020
[tense music playing]

22:16.420 --> 22:18.210
[Alban] What did you do?

22:18.410 --> 22:19.900
Oh, my God!

22:20.990 --> 22:24.700
[Alban] Fuck, James. Fuck!

22:24.890 --> 22:30.700
[breathes heavily]
I didn't see him. [stammers]

22:30.900 --> 22:32.830
- I couldn't see!
- We have to call someone.

22:33.030 --> 22:34.310
[Alban] Call who?

22:34.510 --> 22:36.230
Call the resort,
they'll call our consulate.

22:36.430 --> 22:37.400
[Alban] Nobody will find us.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.490
[James]
How do you call the police?

22:39.690 --> 22:43.100
[Gabi] No police.
Get back in the car.

22:43.300 --> 22:45.360
We're not calling the police.

22:46.100 --> 22:48.590
W-- Wait.

22:48.790 --> 22:51.200
Do you know anything
about jail in Li Tolqa?

22:51.400 --> 22:53.330
This isn't a civilized country.
It's brutal and it's filthy.

22:53.530 --> 22:54.420
We're not getting
picked up for this.

22:54.620 --> 22:55.860
Get back in the car now!

22:56.060 --> 22:57.210
It was an accident.

22:57.410 --> 22:59.990
She's right.
It's very dangerous for us now.

23:00.190 --> 23:01.600
[Em] Oh, my God.
James, we can't.

23:01.800 --> 23:04.130
[Gabi] What do you think's
gonna happen to you?

23:04.330 --> 23:05.430
You'll be raped
by police tonight

23:05.630 --> 23:06.650
and tomorrow
they'll find your body.

23:06.850 --> 23:07.780
That's how it works
with these animals.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.130
I'm not doing that.

23:09.330 --> 23:10.870
You get back in the car,
we drive, you go to bed.

23:11.070 --> 23:11.920
Alban and I will deal
with Mr. Thresh

23:12.120 --> 23:14.080
directly in the morning. Now!

23:18.170 --> 23:20.790
[Gabi shouts loudly]
Now! Alban, drive!

23:25.880 --> 23:28.180
[car engine starts]

23:32.100 --> 23:34.970
[thunder rumbling]

23:43.330 --> 23:46.200
[dramatic music playing]

23:53.510 --> 23:54.520
[Gabi] Hello?

23:54.720 --> 23:56.300
- [guard] Hey.
- [Gabi] Hi, there.

23:58.690 --> 24:01.310
Guys, we seem to be locked out.

24:01.510 --> 24:02.880
[guard] And who are you?

24:03.080 --> 24:05.320
Well, we're guests
at the Pa Qlqa.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.800
We're staying here
but we got lost.

24:08.000 --> 24:09.800
[guard] How did you
get through the gate?

24:10.000 --> 24:11.150
[Alban] Excuse me, sir.

24:11.350 --> 24:12.850
But we were just coming back
from the disco,

24:13.050 --> 24:16.460
and we seem to have found
ourselves outside somehow.

24:16.660 --> 24:22.330
We-- We must have gone around.
Here, look. My key card.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.340
I'm sorry, I'm not sure
what happened.

24:24.540 --> 24:25.950
Maybe the fence
is drunk tonight.

24:26.150 --> 24:28.070
James, you have your key card?

24:35.430 --> 24:36.390
[guard] Guests are not allowed

24:36.590 --> 24:37.650
beyond the border
of the compound.

24:37.850 --> 24:39.130
[Alban] Yeah, we know.

24:39.330 --> 24:41.340
[Gabi] We're extremely sorry.
It won't happen again.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.660
[gate opening]

24:47.860 --> 24:49.270
[Alban] Thank you.

24:49.470 --> 24:52.270
[crickets chirping]

24:55.620 --> 24:58.490
[James puking, retching]

25:03.320 --> 25:05.600
[Alban] You're okay, yeah?
You're gonna be okay.

25:05.790 --> 25:09.120
We'll see you at breakfast.

25:09.320 --> 25:12.200
[unsettling music playing]

25:35.270 --> 25:37.630
[knocking on door]

25:37.830 --> 25:38.840
[James groans]

25:44.580 --> 25:45.590
[knocking on door continues]

25:45.790 --> 25:47.580
Yeah. I'm coming.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.030
[knocking on door continues]

25:54.230 --> 25:55.420
I'm coming!

26:04.690 --> 26:08.310
Mr. James Foster?

26:08.510 --> 26:11.140
[James] Yeah?

26:11.340 --> 26:15.400
[officer]
You'll have to come with us.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.140
[suspenseful music playing]

26:35.810 --> 26:38.590
[Em hyperventilating]

26:46.300 --> 26:51.480
Excuse me. Excuse me,
where are we going?

26:51.680 --> 26:54.700
[suspenseful music continues]

27:23.990 --> 27:24.950
No, no, no!

27:25.150 --> 27:26.260
[Em] James!

27:26.460 --> 27:27.350
[James] We're together.
We're together!

27:27.540 --> 27:28.430
James!

27:28.630 --> 27:30.570
I'll go--
I'll go with her.

27:30.770 --> 27:33.700
Em, I'll find you!
I'll find you!

27:33.900 --> 27:36.650
[suspenseful music swells]

27:46.140 --> 27:48.180
[music fades]

27:52.840 --> 27:54.540
[thuds]

28:19.610 --> 28:20.650
[echoes] Hello?

28:23.130 --> 28:24.320
[banging on door]

28:24.510 --> 28:26.530
Hello? Can you let me
out of here, please?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.840
Hello?

28:32.040 --> 28:34.800
[door unlocking,
opens and closes]

28:43.370 --> 28:45.680
[Thresh]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

28:45.880 --> 28:47.600
[James] Where's my wife?

28:47.800 --> 28:50.520
Mrs. Foster is fine.

28:50.710 --> 28:52.650
I was speaking with her
in the other room,

28:52.850 --> 28:54.740
just down the hall from here.

28:54.940 --> 28:58.090
A lovely woman.

28:58.290 --> 29:03.660
You must feel very lucky.

29:03.860 --> 29:05.490
Smoke?

29:05.690 --> 29:06.740
No, thank you.

29:21.540 --> 29:24.150
My name
is Detective Iral Thresh.

29:27.800 --> 29:30.080
That surname will sound
familiar,

29:30.280 --> 29:31.730
as you met my uncle Dro Thresh,

29:31.930 --> 29:36.130
who works at the Pa Qlqa
Pearl Princess resort.

29:36.330 --> 29:40.570
I'm told he rented you his car
yesterday morning.

29:40.760 --> 29:43.520
James, I'm going to ask
if that's true,

29:43.720 --> 29:45.830
but before you answer,
I should explain that my uncle

29:46.030 --> 29:47.960
will be in a great deal
of trouble

29:48.160 --> 29:51.880
if he rented you the car,
so, for his benefits,

29:52.080 --> 29:57.760
would you agree to answer
that he did not rent it to you?

29:57.960 --> 30:00.370
What would that change
for me?

30:00.570 --> 30:03.540
Nothing. It's just something
I would appreciate,

30:03.740 --> 30:07.290
given the situation.

30:07.490 --> 30:08.900
Okay.

30:09.100 --> 30:10.280
Thank you.

30:19.510 --> 30:23.480
Mr. Foster, did a resort
worker named Dro Thresh

30:23.680 --> 30:24.870
rent you his car
yesterday morning

30:25.070 --> 30:27.820
at the Pa Qlqa Pearl Princess?

30:31.130 --> 30:32.530
No.

30:32.730 --> 30:36.010
Good.

30:36.210 --> 30:39.540
The Bauer couple,
Gabi and Alban,

30:39.740 --> 30:41.760
have already explained
that after stealing a car

30:41.960 --> 30:45.760
from a man named Dro Thresh
at the Pa Qlqa Pearl Princess,

30:45.960 --> 30:48.420
you went on a joyride
with your wife up the coast.

30:48.620 --> 30:50.810
There you became intoxicated
and hit a farmer

30:51.010 --> 30:54.550
named Myro Myron,
killing him instantly.

30:54.750 --> 30:58.430
You fled the accident
without contacting the police,

30:58.630 --> 31:00.690
and Mr. Myron's body
was found by his family

31:00.890 --> 31:03.210
yesterday morning.

31:03.410 --> 31:05.730
Your wife has confirmed
this account.

31:09.040 --> 31:11.050
Em-- Em did?

31:11.250 --> 31:12.430
Mm-hm.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.130
She was quite forthcoming.

31:20.570 --> 31:22.280
Under our federal law
in Li Tolqa,

31:22.480 --> 31:24.840
if you are responsible
for the death of a man,

31:25.040 --> 31:27.800
including in the case
of an avoidable accident,

31:28.000 --> 31:31.280
his eldest son should kill you
to preserve the family's honor.

31:31.480 --> 31:34.240
We do it here in the station,
on Level B.

31:34.440 --> 31:38.990
Wha...? [chuckles]

31:39.190 --> 31:41.950
What... What'd you say?

31:42.150 --> 31:43.510
In the case
that there is no son,

31:43.710 --> 31:45.390
the state will take on
that role.

31:45.590 --> 31:47.170
But luckily,
Mr. Myron has two sons,

31:47.370 --> 31:49.350
ages nine and 13.

31:49.550 --> 31:53.870
But-- But-- But--
But it's not... I'm sorry.

31:54.070 --> 31:57.700
Please. Please. It-- it--

31:57.900 --> 32:02.050
James, it is unlikely
that we will kill you.

32:02.250 --> 32:04.270
Are you aware of the Revised
Process of Doubles Act

32:04.470 --> 32:07.220
for International Visitors
and Diplomats?

32:09.920 --> 32:12.370
Physical doubles.

32:12.570 --> 32:13.890
This is the deal
my government offers

32:14.090 --> 32:15.890
to foreign visitors
in your situation

32:16.090 --> 32:19.860
as part of our longstanding
tourism initiative.

32:20.050 --> 32:23.900
For a significant sum,
the state will build a double

32:24.100 --> 32:26.510
to stand in for your execution.

32:26.710 --> 32:31.480
Importantly, and this is key
to our diplomatic agreement,

32:31.670 --> 32:33.870
it will also maintain
your memories,

32:34.070 --> 32:36.960
and so will believe itself
to be guilty of your crimes

32:37.160 --> 32:38.570
at the time of death.

32:38.770 --> 32:41.530
Do you, James William Foster,
consent to be doubled,

32:41.730 --> 32:43.970
and to the associated fee,

32:44.170 --> 32:47.260
for the purposes of satisfying
our legal proceedings?

32:51.140 --> 32:54.630
I'm sorry. I-- I--
I don't quite understand.

32:54.830 --> 32:57.710
Would you prefer
to be executed?

33:00.190 --> 33:01.580
Please sign.

33:07.460 --> 33:09.730

[distorted sound playing]

37:41.780 --> 37:43.390
[Em] Are you all right?

37:46.560 --> 37:51.360
Em? Where am I?

37:51.560 --> 37:55.360
We're still at the station.
You're recovering.

37:57.230 --> 37:59.850
Does it hurt?

38:00.050 --> 38:04.240
My head is killing me.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.990
They told me the double
turned out correctly.

38:08.180 --> 38:11.950
It's already finished.

38:12.150 --> 38:14.470
The double?

38:14.670 --> 38:17.260
The surrogate.

38:17.460 --> 38:19.600
They're waiting for us
downstairs.

38:23.510 --> 38:26.390
[footsteps]

38:54.590 --> 38:57.340
[Thresh]
Often, it takes a few attempts.

38:57.540 --> 38:59.120
Even the smallest imperfection

38:59.320 --> 39:03.040
is unacceptable
to the language of the law.

39:03.240 --> 39:07.610
But this one...

39:07.810 --> 39:12.880
has turned out the first time.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.230
But how...?

39:14.430 --> 39:15.910
It's horrible.

39:26.270 --> 39:30.070
It looks just like me.

39:30.270 --> 39:34.330
You will both be present
for the execution.

39:34.530 --> 39:36.330
Oh, no.
I don't want to see it.

39:36.530 --> 39:37.810
[Thresh]
This is non-negotiable.

39:44.460 --> 39:45.650
[gasps]

39:45.850 --> 39:46.740
Oh.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.030
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

39:58.350 --> 40:01.480
[suspenseful music playing]

40:39.300 --> 40:42.130
[footsteps approaching]

41:06.460 --> 41:08.500
Please... James.

41:15.770 --> 41:20.870
No. No, no, no.

41:21.070 --> 41:25.140
Please. Don't. I-- I...

41:25.340 --> 41:27.880
Please don't. I didn't...

41:28.080 --> 41:33.840
Em, please. Em, please!

41:34.040 --> 41:37.630
Em! Em!

41:37.830 --> 41:43.510
Em, help me! Em!

41:43.700 --> 41:47.680
Please help! Em!

41:47.880 --> 41:53.720
Help me! Help, Em! Help!

41:57.550 --> 42:01.510
No! Em, please!

42:04.870 --> 42:07.740
- [grunting]
- [blood splattering]

42:15.010 --> 42:16.920
[grunting]

42:18.970 --> 42:21.100
[blood splattering]

43:16.150 --> 43:20.160
[tragic music playing]

43:36.090 --> 43:38.970
This is the ashes
for you to take.

43:39.170 --> 43:40.610
Consider this a souvenir.

43:43.050 --> 43:45.880
A car is waiting to bring you
back to the resort.

43:49.230 --> 43:52.450
[clattering]

43:55.760 --> 43:59.550
[Em] Can you fucking help?

43:59.750 --> 44:02.240
All right, there's a shuttle
to the airport in 15 minutes.

44:03.680 --> 44:06.260
James? James!

44:06.460 --> 44:08.210
Yeah? Yeah.

44:08.410 --> 44:09.640
[Em] What the fuck.

44:26.180 --> 44:28.500
[James] Where the...?

44:28.700 --> 44:29.710
[Em] What?

44:29.910 --> 44:32.540
My passport.
I can't find my passport.

44:32.740 --> 44:34.070
[Em] What do you mean?

44:34.270 --> 44:35.290
I don't know. I always
put it in my carry-on.

44:35.480 --> 44:36.420
It's not here.

44:36.620 --> 44:37.500
What do you mean
you can't find it?

44:37.700 --> 44:38.850
I... I don't know
where it is.

44:39.050 --> 44:40.120
- It-- It's all--
- [Em] James, we have to leave.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.770
Well, I know,
I'm looking but it's not,

44:41.970 --> 44:42.950
- I can't-- I don't know--
- We have to leave!

44:43.140 --> 44:44.560
We have to leave!
We have to leave!

44:44.760 --> 44:45.770
- Fuck!
- [suitcase thuds]

45:01.350 --> 45:06.220
If you want to go without me,
I'll understand.

45:10.090 --> 45:12.440
I'll come home as soon
as I can get on a flight.

45:19.100 --> 45:20.760
Em?

45:26.980 --> 45:29.240
It's really so disgusting.

45:32.420 --> 45:33.460
What?

45:39.340 --> 45:44.660
It's really so disgusting
that you could just...

45:44.860 --> 45:48.100
sit there

45:48.300 --> 45:51.580
and watch it happen.

45:51.780 --> 45:57.110
Like a robot.

45:57.310 --> 45:58.750
What's wrong with you?

46:05.410 --> 46:08.900
I'm gonna go down
to the front desk,

46:09.100 --> 46:13.990
see if they can help.

46:14.190 --> 46:18.480
Okay?

46:18.670 --> 46:19.990
I'll be right back.

46:28.220 --> 46:30.750
[receptionist]
Yes, I understand.

46:30.950 --> 46:32.970
Thank you. Thank you.

46:33.170 --> 46:36.190
Thank you for your patience,
Mr. Foster.

46:36.390 --> 46:38.050
Would you like us
to extend your room booking?

46:41.360 --> 46:42.710
Mr. Foster?

46:44.840 --> 46:49.640
Sorry. Um, is our room
still available?

46:49.840 --> 46:51.070
[receptionist] Yes, Mr. Foster.

46:51.270 --> 46:52.470
Your room is still available

46:52.670 --> 46:54.860
until we close down
at the end of the month.

46:55.060 --> 46:56.300
We have a number
of free rooms now

46:56.500 --> 46:59.860
with the rainy season coming up.

47:00.060 --> 47:04.090
Okay. Well, let's say extend it
by another week, to start with.

47:04.290 --> 47:07.470
[receptionist] Uh, will this
still be under Em Foster?

47:08.650 --> 47:10.610
Yes.

47:10.810 --> 47:12.010
[receptionist] Wonderful.

47:12.210 --> 47:13.880
Is there anything else
I can help you with today?

47:14.080 --> 47:15.350
[James] No. Thank you.

47:21.620 --> 47:23.710
Are you leaving us?

47:23.910 --> 47:25.320
As soon as I can.

47:25.520 --> 47:26.490
[Gabi] That's a shame.

47:28.880 --> 47:31.450
James, I'm sorry.

47:34.590 --> 47:38.560
Come have a drink with me
and let me explain.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.850
Please.

47:44.470 --> 47:46.610
The first year we came,
Alban was working as

47:46.810 --> 47:50.090
a consultant on the construction
of a new resort.

47:50.290 --> 47:53.220
The Bot Vre 2.
Do you know it?

47:53.420 --> 47:55.180
No.

47:55.380 --> 47:56.660
It's just a few compounds
over from here,

47:56.860 --> 47:58.440
north up the beach.

47:58.640 --> 48:00.970
They were installing
an infinity pool,

48:01.170 --> 48:03.490
one of Alban's designs.

48:03.690 --> 48:04.930
A little pervy,
with a glass bottom

48:05.130 --> 48:08.240
that you could look up into
from the bar.

48:08.440 --> 48:10.200
But the plate split
and fell off the crane,

48:10.400 --> 48:12.330
and two workers were killed.

48:12.530 --> 48:14.810
The owner of the Bot Vre
put the blame on Alban

48:15.010 --> 48:18.810
and so we were arrested.
Penalty of death.

48:19.010 --> 48:22.690
And we made a discovery then
that you have now discovered.

48:22.890 --> 48:25.120
A discovery.

48:25.320 --> 48:30.860
Are you upset?
Maybe think of it as a gift.

48:33.730 --> 48:35.860
You said you were
looking for inspiration.

48:39.040 --> 48:43.190
There's something
to the experience, isn't there?

48:43.380 --> 48:46.580
You come out of it feeling...

48:46.780 --> 48:48.580
it's hard to explain
but I can see it in your eyes,

48:48.780 --> 48:50.010
if you know what I mean.

48:54.010 --> 48:56.370
Will you come
to our villa tonight?

48:56.570 --> 48:58.420
There are a few others
we've encountered over the years

48:58.620 --> 49:01.060
who share our little secret.

49:08.850 --> 49:11.330
[thunder rumbles]

49:17.430 --> 49:20.340
[distant music playing]

49:24.130 --> 49:26.230
[Alban] Oh, James.

49:26.430 --> 49:29.400
James, you made it.

49:31.140 --> 49:35.370
You're completely transformed.
You look so beautiful now.

49:35.570 --> 49:38.200
I can see the beauty
just pouring right out of you.

49:38.400 --> 49:40.900
Here, quickly.

49:41.090 --> 49:43.590
- [man] Yes.
- [Alban] Quickly.

49:43.790 --> 49:48.250
Yes, that's correct.

49:48.450 --> 49:51.430
A little bit more.
Here. Here. Come.

49:51.630 --> 49:53.690
- [James] Thank you.
- [Alban] Come, come, come, come.

49:53.890 --> 49:57.170
Everyone, everyone.

49:57.370 --> 50:01.610
This is the new friend
I was telling you about.

50:01.810 --> 50:07.490
James, this is Charles,
Jennifer, Dr. Modan,

50:07.690 --> 50:09.840
and the beautiful Bex.

50:10.040 --> 50:11.270
[Bex giggles]

50:11.470 --> 50:13.970
Nice to meet you.

50:14.170 --> 50:16.890
[Alban] Do you know that Bex's
father is a film producer?

50:17.090 --> 50:18.450
Wow.

50:18.650 --> 50:21.760
[Alban] Maybe he'll turn
your book into a movie.

50:21.960 --> 50:23.680
[Jennifer]
So, you're a writer?

50:23.880 --> 50:26.420
[James] Sort of.

50:26.620 --> 50:27.590
[Jennifer] Sort of?

50:27.790 --> 50:28.990
[others laugh]

50:29.190 --> 50:30.600
What does that mean?

50:30.800 --> 50:32.770
[Gabi] James wrote a very
brilliant book that I love.

50:32.970 --> 50:33.770
[Alban] Mm.

50:33.970 --> 50:35.430
[Jennifer] Okay.

50:35.630 --> 50:37.560
So then,
what is this book about?

50:37.760 --> 50:40.130
[Charles] Don't harass the man.
He's just had a very bad day.

50:40.330 --> 50:42.780
[laughter]

50:42.980 --> 50:44.220
It's quite all right.

50:44.420 --> 50:45.870
[Jennifer] I'm just curious
about our new zombie.

50:46.070 --> 50:47.530
You don't have to be afraid,
James.

50:47.730 --> 50:49.310
We are all zombies here.

50:49.510 --> 50:52.010
[laughter]

50:52.210 --> 50:53.750
[Bex] Well, you're certainly
a flesh-eater.

50:53.950 --> 50:55.570
- [Jennifer] Oh, please.
- [Charles] Ladies.

50:57.790 --> 51:01.500
[Alban] Everyone here
is a brother, James.

51:01.700 --> 51:03.500
You don't understand
Li Tolqa yet,

51:03.700 --> 51:06.020
but they are very generous
with discipline,

51:06.220 --> 51:08.030
especially if they know
you can pay.

51:08.230 --> 51:11.460
[laughter]

51:11.660 --> 51:13.770
Very conservative
outside the resorts.

51:13.970 --> 51:16.340
Very religious.

51:16.540 --> 51:22.300
They will kill you
for drugs, blasphemy, sodomy.

51:22.500 --> 51:28.310
[Bex] Can you guess
which one of us was sodomy?

51:28.510 --> 51:31.610
[laughter]

51:31.810 --> 51:32.830
[Dr. Modan] Honestly,
it's amazing that anyone

51:33.030 --> 51:35.530
is still alive in this country.

51:35.730 --> 51:38.970
You know, James, I'm glad
you could come tonight.

51:39.170 --> 51:41.450
It's a great time
to have you with us.

51:41.650 --> 51:43.020
[Gabi]
Dr. Modan is writing a paper

51:43.220 --> 51:45.500
on the Li Tolqan
doubling tradition.

51:45.700 --> 51:47.150
[Dr. Modan] It's Bob, please.

51:47.350 --> 51:49.500
I was wondering
if I could ask you a question

51:49.700 --> 51:52.500
while you're still fresh,
as they say.

51:52.700 --> 51:55.070
Sure.

51:55.270 --> 51:57.380
[Dr. Modan] Do you worry
they got the wrong man?

51:57.580 --> 51:59.030
[Jennifer] Oh, God.

51:59.230 --> 52:02.300
[Dr. Modan] Do-- Do you think,
I mean, looking back on it,

52:02.500 --> 52:04.560
that they killed the real James?

52:04.760 --> 52:06.560
That was my biggest fear
after my own experience.

52:06.760 --> 52:08.740
Because you wake up
in that little room,

52:08.940 --> 52:12.520
and for all you know, they
could've just swapped you out.

52:12.720 --> 52:14.870
Hard to say what happened
while you were asleep.

52:15.070 --> 52:16.350
[Jennifer]
So, what does it matter?

52:16.550 --> 52:18.440
You have to let it go.
I've let it go.

52:18.640 --> 52:20.710
[Dr. Modan] How can I?

52:20.910 --> 52:22.490
I'll never know
if I'm really myself,

52:22.690 --> 52:24.320
for as long as I live.

52:24.520 --> 52:26.630
[Jennifer]
Exactly, so who cares?

52:26.830 --> 52:28.980
[Charles]
What do you think, James?

52:29.180 --> 52:33.980
Do you fear you may have just
witnessed your own demise?

52:34.180 --> 52:35.240
I can only hope.

52:35.440 --> 52:37.200
[others laugh]

52:37.400 --> 52:40.150
[water running]

52:43.890 --> 52:46.770
[phone vibrating]

53:03.090 --> 53:04.870
Are you feeling all right?

53:07.880 --> 53:08.890
Ah, yeah, yeah.

53:09.080 --> 53:10.620
Just, um...

53:12.400 --> 53:14.890
Maybe I had
too much to drink.

53:15.090 --> 53:16.410
I don't think that's it.

53:19.930 --> 53:23.770
The first day
is always difficult.

53:23.970 --> 53:29.730
It's like a new skin
working itself into place.

53:29.930 --> 53:33.210
And in your case, I can see
something special happening.

53:38.300 --> 53:41.660
I have this...

53:41.860 --> 53:45.480
pressure...
in my head...

53:48.610 --> 53:50.000
[Gabi] It will pass.

53:54.750 --> 53:59.890
James...

54:00.090 --> 54:02.060
Will you trust me tonight?

54:06.540 --> 54:08.850
- [gun fired]
- [screams, laughing]

54:12.070 --> 54:14.560
He got it from
one of the cleaning staff.

54:14.760 --> 54:16.870
It's fine. Come.

54:17.070 --> 54:19.470
[laughing continues]

54:20.640 --> 54:22.870
[man] That was a great shot.

54:23.070 --> 54:26.570
James. James, why don't you
come over here for a moment.

54:26.770 --> 54:28.790
I have a proposition for you.

54:28.990 --> 54:30.660
Don't worry about this gun.

54:30.860 --> 54:32.190
I hear you have
a passport problem.

54:32.390 --> 54:33.580
Is that right?

54:33.780 --> 54:36.930
That can be a lot of trouble
in a place like this.

54:37.130 --> 54:38.240
I tell you what,

54:38.440 --> 54:41.240
I will talk to my connections
in immigration

54:41.440 --> 54:43.020
and see if I can help

54:43.220 --> 54:45.020
if you play a little game
with us tonight.

54:45.220 --> 54:47.240
[all] Ooh.

54:47.440 --> 54:50.070
[Alban] We just have
a little plan tonight, James.

54:50.270 --> 54:51.680
Just a bit of fun.

54:51.880 --> 54:53.990
[Gabi] Yes, tell him
about the mission.

54:54.190 --> 54:55.600
- [Alban] The mission?
- [man] Yes.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.430
[Dr. Modan] Early this week,
the owner of Bot Vre 2 resort,

54:58.630 --> 55:03.170
he was awarded a medal for
promoting Li Tolqan prosperity.

55:03.370 --> 55:05.650
And there was a ceremony
on the beach.

55:05.850 --> 55:08.270
[Alban] We found out the owner
lives in a house

55:08.470 --> 55:09.960
just up the hill.

55:10.160 --> 55:15.450
So, we decided tonight we will
go get the medal for ourselves.

55:15.650 --> 55:20.630
Just a little game
to play, for fun.

55:20.830 --> 55:24.590
[Gabi] It's actually
rather important to us, James.

55:24.790 --> 55:28.720
I mean, after all,
he did have us executed.

55:28.920 --> 55:31.380
At a certain point, if you don't
respond to an insult like that,

55:31.580 --> 55:33.510
you're such a coward that you'll
just fall to the ground

55:33.710 --> 55:35.810
and never get up again.

55:37.550 --> 55:39.370
[Alban] What do you say?

55:41.380 --> 55:42.780
[Charles] Or maybe
we just off you now

55:42.980 --> 55:44.170
so you don't give us away.

55:44.370 --> 55:46.340
[laughter]

55:59.310 --> 56:00.190
[glass shatters]

56:00.390 --> 56:02.710
[window shattering]

56:02.910 --> 56:05.710
[intense music playing]

56:14.630 --> 56:17.500
[ladies laughing]

56:37.910 --> 56:39.910
[Bex laughs]
A perfect likeness.

56:43.530 --> 56:46.400
[intense music playing]

57:53.730 --> 57:56.600
[crickets chirping]

58:07.610 --> 58:10.480
[James straining]

58:17.450 --> 58:18.930
[door opens]

58:24.190 --> 58:27.120
[groaning]

58:27.320 --> 58:30.110
[woman screaming]

59:03.620 --> 59:05.810
[woman] We found it!

59:06.010 --> 59:08.840
[laughter]

59:11.670 --> 59:14.560
[owner screaming]

59:14.750 --> 59:17.550
[muffled screaming]

59:49.280 --> 59:52.150
Have you ever
fired a gun before?

59:59.940 --> 1:00:02.810
[footsteps]

1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:12.650
It would be so easy.

1:00:18.090 --> 1:00:20.480
Not everybody gets this chance.

1:00:50.250 --> 1:00:53.170
[gun cocks]

1:01:00.220 --> 1:01:05.670
Hey, what are you kids
up to in here?

1:01:05.870 --> 1:01:07.320
Just playing chicken.

1:01:07.520 --> 1:01:11.850
Oh. Have you seen
what he has in this place?

1:01:12.050 --> 1:01:14.330
James, you're going
to want a drink,

1:01:14.530 --> 1:01:16.100
and you're going
to want a cigar.

1:01:19.450 --> 1:01:22.510
You have beautiful taste, sir.

1:01:22.710 --> 1:01:24.590
I'm really starting to like you.

1:01:42.130 --> 1:01:44.910
- [rapid gunfire]
- [all screaming]

1:01:53.140 --> 1:01:54.630
[screaming]

1:01:54.830 --> 1:01:58.060
[Indian music
playing on speaker]

1:02:07.020 --> 1:02:09.290
[Alban grunting]

1:02:11.900 --> 1:02:14.170
[Dr. Modan] We need to get him
inside, right now.

1:02:14.370 --> 1:02:16.820
[Alban] Yes.

1:02:17.020 --> 1:02:19.390
[James] My building
is just around the corner.

1:02:19.590 --> 1:02:21.440
To the right.

1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:23.050
[Alban grunting]

1:02:23.250 --> 1:02:26.050
[indistinct chatter]

1:02:26.250 --> 1:02:28.040
[James grunting]

1:02:31.090 --> 1:02:32.270
[groaning in pain]

1:02:32.470 --> 1:02:33.360
[Em screaming]

1:02:33.560 --> 1:02:34.710
[indistinct chatter]

1:02:34.910 --> 1:02:36.540
[James] It's okay, honey!

1:02:36.740 --> 1:02:38.500
- [Dr. Modan] I need some towels.
- [Em] James, what's going on?

1:02:38.700 --> 1:02:40.200
- [Alban groaning in pain]
- [Dr. Modan] No, no, no, no!

1:02:40.390 --> 1:02:43.150
[cries out in pain]

1:02:47.630 --> 1:02:49.120
[Jennifer] They really
should have water in here.

1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:50.600
Charles, do you have
any water on you?

1:02:50.800 --> 1:02:53.770
They took my bag, sweetheart.

1:02:53.970 --> 1:02:54.910
[Jennifer]
Why don't you be a gentleman

1:02:55.110 --> 1:02:56.600
and give Gabi your seat?

1:02:56.800 --> 1:02:58.780
[Charles] Because I'm old.

1:02:58.980 --> 1:03:01.700
I went for a colonoscopy
last month,

1:03:01.890 --> 1:03:05.090
and it was like looking
at a painting by Jackson Polyp.

1:03:05.290 --> 1:03:07.220
[Dr. Modan laughs]

1:03:07.420 --> 1:03:10.050
[Dr. Modan] James, do you know
why the doubling tradition

1:03:10.250 --> 1:03:13.580
is unique to Li Tolqa?

1:03:13.780 --> 1:03:18.060
I'm starting to think
it's just their poetic flair.

1:03:18.260 --> 1:03:20.580
We've spent years trying to
reproduce the process in the lab

1:03:20.780 --> 1:03:23.630
but we're far too literal.

1:03:23.830 --> 1:03:24.760
We just never taken
into account...

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:26.550
- [door rattling]
- [Jennifer] Uh, finally.

1:03:26.750 --> 1:03:28.240
...the transcend connection--

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:29.420
- [door clicks open]
- [Jennifer] Hi.

1:03:29.620 --> 1:03:31.940
We've been waiting
in here for hours.

1:03:32.140 --> 1:03:33.160
[door slams shut]

1:03:33.360 --> 1:03:35.110
Do you feel
you've been inconvenienced?

1:03:36.550 --> 1:03:37.770
[Dr. Modan] Well... [chuckles]

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:44.350
Our country is not a playground
for foreign children.

1:03:44.550 --> 1:03:47.040
It sometimes seems
we have forgotten this.

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:50.830
But maybe not today.

1:03:51.030 --> 1:03:53.700
You've tested the limits
of our hospitality.

1:03:53.900 --> 1:03:57.050
And today I'm feeling inspired
to make a statement.

1:03:58.570 --> 1:04:00.970
What do you say?

1:04:01.170 --> 1:04:01.970
Yes, please.

1:04:02.170 --> 1:04:04.760
[laughing]

1:04:04.960 --> 1:04:05.850
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey!

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:06.890
[all shouting]

1:04:07.090 --> 1:04:08.110
I can walk.

1:04:08.310 --> 1:04:09.980
[Dr. Modan] What's going on?

1:04:10.180 --> 1:04:11.330
- [officer] Go now!
- [Gabi] Okay.

1:04:11.530 --> 1:04:12.330
[Dr. Modan] Okay.

1:04:12.530 --> 1:04:13.330
[Gabi] Okay.

1:04:13.530 --> 1:04:15.030
[officer] Come on.

1:04:15.230 --> 1:04:18.370
[suspenseful music playing]

1:04:22.940 --> 1:04:24.030
[Charles] Where are we?

1:04:25.510 --> 1:04:28.040
[Alban]
Detective, where are we going?

1:04:28.240 --> 1:04:29.650
We're ready to pay now.

1:04:29.850 --> 1:04:35.660
[clamoring, shouting]

1:04:35.860 --> 1:04:38.260
[overlapping screams]

1:04:49.530 --> 1:04:50.580
[Gabi] Alban!

1:04:52.970 --> 1:04:54.890
[screams and arguments]

1:04:56.930 --> 1:05:00.940
[screaming]

1:05:04.420 --> 1:05:05.460
Alban!

1:05:09.120 --> 1:05:10.340
Leave her alone!

1:05:12.160 --> 1:05:13.380
No!

1:05:15.040 --> 1:05:17.080
[grunting]

1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:19.390
Get away from me!

1:05:22.040 --> 1:05:24.050
- Get away from me!
- [Gabi] James!

1:05:25.260 --> 1:05:27.400
[all shouting]

1:05:29.400 --> 1:05:30.790
No! Go! Aah!

1:05:40.240 --> 1:05:43.160
[panting]

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:45.980
- [blood splattering]
- [grunting]

1:05:49.330 --> 1:05:50.730
James!

1:05:50.930 --> 1:05:54.250
[suspenseful music swells,
fades]

1:05:55.340 --> 1:05:56.780
[clapping]

1:05:56.980 --> 1:06:01.050
[Alban] Bravo! Bravo!

1:06:01.250 --> 1:06:02.660
Well done, James!

1:06:02.860 --> 1:06:05.230
I didn't think
you had it in you!

1:06:05.430 --> 1:06:07.450
[clapping continues]

1:06:07.650 --> 1:06:10.010
Beautiful.

1:06:10.210 --> 1:06:12.880
- [doubles convulsing horribly]
- [blood splattering]

1:06:27.980 --> 1:06:30.420
- [beeps]
- [door opens]

1:06:33.990 --> 1:06:35.160
Em?

1:06:37.210 --> 1:06:39.170
What's wrong with you?

1:06:39.370 --> 1:06:40.510
With me?

1:06:42.040 --> 1:06:44.090
I'm leaving.

1:06:44.290 --> 1:06:46.310
I don't have a passport.

1:06:46.510 --> 1:06:49.440
Well then,
I guess you get to stay.

1:06:49.640 --> 1:06:51.480
They told me I've already paid.

1:06:59.710 --> 1:07:01.060
Is this a dream?

1:07:04.150 --> 1:07:05.670
It would make more sense.

1:07:09.890 --> 1:07:11.380
You've gone wrong
around the eyes,

1:07:11.580 --> 1:07:13.500
like one of those crabs
at the dump.

1:07:17.990 --> 1:07:19.330
Go on, then.

1:07:20.680 --> 1:07:22.120
Run back to Daddy.

1:07:33.480 --> 1:07:35.740
[suitcase wheels rolling]

1:07:36.830 --> 1:07:38.180
Wait...

1:07:40.010 --> 1:07:41.050
[door closes]

1:07:57.810 --> 1:08:00.680
[seagulls squawking]

1:08:26.970 --> 1:08:28.270
[James] Em left today.

1:08:29.880 --> 1:08:31.580
[Gabi] That may be for the best.

1:08:38.370 --> 1:08:39.760
[James]
We've been together ten years.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:42.820
It's none of my business

1:08:43.020 --> 1:08:44.680
but I don't really think
she suits you.

1:08:48.730 --> 1:08:50.520
Men are trained
by women like Em

1:08:50.720 --> 1:08:53.790
to see themselves as weak.

1:08:53.990 --> 1:08:55.950
It can take some work to undo.

1:08:58.220 --> 1:08:59.610
It can take some blood.

1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:04.740
I don't know about that.

1:09:35.210 --> 1:09:38.080
[rain falling]

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000
The rainy season is coming.

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:47.270
Will you walk with me?

1:09:48.270 --> 1:09:51.400
[tense music playing]

1:10:21.650 --> 1:10:23.520
[thunder rumbling]

1:10:28.350 --> 1:10:30.270
[James] What's that?

1:10:30.470 --> 1:10:32.450
[Gabi]
It's called the ekki gate.

1:10:32.650 --> 1:10:36.110
It's a traditional
Li Tolqan root drug.

1:10:36.310 --> 1:10:37.750
I got it from one of the guards.

1:10:39.400 --> 1:10:40.490
What does it do?

1:10:41.670 --> 1:10:43.770
It's a hallucinogen.

1:10:43.960 --> 1:10:45.240
Also an aphrodisiac.

1:10:48.850 --> 1:10:52.210
Drug use is heavily restricted
in the modern state,

1:10:52.410 --> 1:10:54.110
but this is considered
to be religious.

1:11:01.120 --> 1:11:02.600
[match lit]

1:11:12.260 --> 1:11:14.740
I want you to show me
how strong you are.

1:11:32.850 --> 1:11:35.760
[coughing]

1:11:39.990 --> 1:11:41.610
It's horrible.

1:11:41.810 --> 1:11:43.030
You'll come to like it.

1:12:06.750 --> 1:12:08.800
How long does it take
for it to work?

1:13:12.770 --> 1:13:15.820
[rhythmic sensual music playing]

1:16:29.010 --> 1:16:31.890
[birds chirping]

1:16:53.600 --> 1:16:54.910
[giggling]

1:16:57.040 --> 1:16:58.090
[spits cherry]

1:17:00.920 --> 1:17:03.100
Come on.

1:17:03.300 --> 1:17:04.350
[whispers] Pathetic.

1:17:06.270 --> 1:17:07.240
[glass shattering]

1:17:07.430 --> 1:17:09.500
Ooh.

1:17:09.700 --> 1:17:12.200
[Jennifer] Not so loud.

1:17:12.400 --> 1:17:13.240
[Charles] You know, James,

1:17:13.440 --> 1:17:14.590
[coughs]

1:17:14.790 --> 1:17:18.120
I spoke to my son-in-law
about your passport.

1:17:18.320 --> 1:17:19.160
About what?

1:17:19.360 --> 1:17:22.210
Your new--
Your new passport.

1:17:22.410 --> 1:17:26.300
He said it's Thresh who is
the problem, the detective.

1:17:26.500 --> 1:17:28.390
Thresh is holding you back
from leaving.

1:17:28.590 --> 1:17:31.350
Probably hoping
to bring you in again

1:17:31.550 --> 1:17:34.830
and fill up his pretty
police piggy bank.

1:17:35.030 --> 1:17:37.700
[Gabi] The Li Tolqans
only understand one thing.

1:17:37.900 --> 1:17:40.960
You need to show him that you're
the dominant in this conflict.

1:17:41.160 --> 1:17:42.660
[Alban] Yeah.

1:17:42.860 --> 1:17:44.840
They're like baboons.

1:17:45.040 --> 1:17:47.280
[Alban] Like baboons,
but we think we know

1:17:47.470 --> 1:17:49.320
just the thing to help.

1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:50.630
[James] Oh, yeah?

1:17:50.830 --> 1:17:54.410
Trigeminal neuralgia, James.

1:17:54.610 --> 1:17:56.680
[Dr. Modan] <i>It seems</i>
<i>the detective is due for</i>

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:59.500
<i>a glycerol injection tonight</i>

1:17:59.700 --> 1:18:01.500
<i>at Li Tolqa Brain and Spine.</i>

1:18:12.770 --> 1:18:15.600
[Alban] Hey, James. James.

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:18.950
Why don't you stand down?

1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:22.340
[Dr. Modan]
We're gonna be fast.

1:18:34.140 --> 1:18:37.270
[door opens, closes]

1:19:08.220 --> 1:19:11.090
[engine rumbling]

1:19:20.450 --> 1:19:23.100
- [engine revving]
- [tires screeching]

1:19:26.190 --> 1:19:29.020
[James breathing heavily]

1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:44.830
[Dr. Modan] Any trouble?

1:19:45.030 --> 1:19:47.090
There was a police van...

1:19:47.290 --> 1:19:49.570
Almost ran me down.

1:19:49.770 --> 1:19:51.700
[Alban] Oh. They just
sold out their boss.

1:19:51.900 --> 1:19:53.480
Probably had to get drunk first.

1:20:27.030 --> 1:20:28.910
[inhales deeply]

1:21:05.380 --> 1:21:06.420
[woman] Oh.

1:21:12.820 --> 1:21:14.520
Show him your strength, James.

1:21:20.960 --> 1:21:22.450
[Bex giggles]

1:21:22.650 --> 1:21:24.410
[Bex]
Yeah, I like that. I like that.

1:21:24.600 --> 1:21:26.360
[Charles] Attaboy, James.

1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:28.020
[Jennifer] Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1:21:28.220 --> 1:21:30.970
[James speaking gibberish]

1:21:34.580 --> 1:21:39.240
[James grunting]

1:21:41.500 --> 1:21:43.630
- [grunts]
- [all cheering]

1:21:46.850 --> 1:21:51.430
- [all] Oh!
- [laughter]

1:21:51.630 --> 1:21:53.250
[yelling]

1:21:55.730 --> 1:21:59.400
[cheering, laughing]

1:21:59.600 --> 1:22:04.390
[all] Oh!

1:22:08.010 --> 1:22:10.400
[James growling]

1:22:27.020 --> 1:22:29.420
[cheering, laughing]

1:22:33.680 --> 1:22:35.160
Aaaaahhh!

1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:40.000
Whooh!

1:22:40.200 --> 1:22:42.430
[applauding]

1:23:04.060 --> 1:23:06.980
[laughing]

1:23:30.780 --> 1:23:32.970
[door opens, closes]

1:23:33.170 --> 1:23:35.310
[door lock clicks]

1:23:38.270 --> 1:23:41.100
[James breathing heavily]

1:23:51.540 --> 1:23:54.460
[sobs]

1:24:10.080 --> 1:24:12.960
[faint singing]

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:25.750
[singing]

1:24:45.990 --> 1:24:47.430
[knocks on door]

1:24:50.650 --> 1:24:52.310
[Gabi] James.

1:24:52.510 --> 1:24:54.830
[knocks on door]

1:24:55.030 --> 1:24:57.050
James, come on. You aren't
really upset, are you?

1:24:57.250 --> 1:24:59.270
It's just a little joke.

1:24:59.470 --> 1:25:01.190
We paid the detective
to make another double

1:25:01.390 --> 1:25:03.440
just to have a little fun
with you.

1:25:06.310 --> 1:25:07.630
[door rattles]

1:25:07.830 --> 1:25:09.010
James, open up.

1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:14.550
Maybe I'll bring the double here
and you can both fuck me.

1:25:14.750 --> 1:25:15.890
Have you ever tried that?

1:25:19.980 --> 1:25:21.420
Don't be pathetic tonight,
James.

1:25:21.620 --> 1:25:23.420
It's so unattractive.

1:25:39.690 --> 1:25:42.520
[intense music playing]

1:27:04.170 --> 1:27:07.090
[car honking]

1:27:09.780 --> 1:27:11.050
[mouths] Hi.

1:27:26.630 --> 1:27:29.940
[car honking]

1:27:33.370 --> 1:27:34.910
- [gun fired]
- [bus window shattering]

1:27:35.110 --> 1:27:37.070
[bus tires screech]

1:27:56.660 --> 1:27:58.270
[Gabi] James!

1:28:05.140 --> 1:28:06.890
James!

1:28:08.060 --> 1:28:10.850
Come out, James!

1:28:12.670 --> 1:28:17.430
What are you doing in there,
James? Huh?

1:28:17.630 --> 1:28:21.680
Where do you think
you're going, you little baby?

1:28:24.470 --> 1:28:30.520
James!

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:45.400
Members of the bus!

1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:50.940
Give us the coward James Foster,

1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:54.250
or I will come in shooting!

1:28:54.450 --> 1:28:57.420
He is a spineless worm
and a bedwetter

1:28:57.620 --> 1:29:01.590
and he'd sell his own mother
for horse meat to save himself!

1:29:16.520 --> 1:29:22.270
Yeah. Jamesy!

1:29:22.470 --> 1:29:26.270
Come on. Come on, little baby.

1:29:27.710 --> 1:29:32.140
Come on, James. Come on. Come.

1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:42.370
[car revving]

1:29:57.080 --> 1:29:59.210
You're so pathetic, James.

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:02.390
A real sucky baby.

1:30:04.310 --> 1:30:07.350
I can always pick out
a sucky baby for us.

1:30:08.620 --> 1:30:09.790
What a joke.

1:30:11.230 --> 1:30:14.500
This whole time,
we've been laughing at you.

1:30:14.700 --> 1:30:17.450
You're just a bit of fun
for us on our vacation.

1:30:18.670 --> 1:30:21.680
And such a terrible driver!

1:30:21.880 --> 1:30:24.380
I can't believe
you ran that guy over, James.

1:30:24.580 --> 1:30:26.470
Do you remember that?

1:30:26.670 --> 1:30:28.860
We thought we'd have
to get you into trouble,

1:30:29.060 --> 1:30:31.990
turns out you're such an idiot
you did it yourself.

1:30:35.430 --> 1:30:36.770
Faster!

1:30:41.910 --> 1:30:43.350
I never read your book.

1:30:47.740 --> 1:30:49.130
Did you believe that?

1:30:51.750 --> 1:30:53.010
I'm a good actress.

1:30:54.970 --> 1:30:56.450
It was hard to look you up.

1:30:58.060 --> 1:31:03.070
One shitty book six years ago
that nobody read.

1:31:03.270 --> 1:31:05.330
Bad reviews.

1:31:05.530 --> 1:31:06.990
You're so vain, James,

1:31:07.190 --> 1:31:08.900
to actually believe
that we read it.

1:31:09.100 --> 1:31:10.250
It's sort of funny,

1:31:10.450 --> 1:31:12.420
but really more than anything,
it's depressing.

1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:16.380
Mm.

1:31:18.770 --> 1:31:23.210
I do have a review with me,
Jamesy.

1:31:25.080 --> 1:31:26.130
Have you read this one?

1:31:28.220 --> 1:31:33.270
[reading] <i>"The Variable Sheath:</i>
As Bad as Its Title.

1:31:33.470 --> 1:31:36.970
Seeming to recognize
his own lack of talent,

1:31:37.170 --> 1:31:42.110
newcomer James W. Foster
overcompensates with pretension,

1:31:42.310 --> 1:31:45.720
failed posturing
that only serves to emphasize

1:31:45.920 --> 1:31:49.510
how truly terrible
this debut really is.

1:31:49.710 --> 1:31:52.820
<i>Sheath</i>is a book
that has nothing to say

1:31:53.020 --> 1:31:55.340
and lacks the words to say it.

1:31:55.540 --> 1:31:59.260
One can't help but wonder
whether its very existence

1:31:59.460 --> 1:32:02.350
is owed to Foster's powerful
father-in-law,

1:32:02.550 --> 1:32:05.480
media mogul Edward Servek.

1:32:05.680 --> 1:32:08.740
Maurice Tate

struggles therein--"

1:32:11.730 --> 1:32:15.620
Ah. Oh, no.
Alban, my wine.

1:32:15.820 --> 1:32:17.710
- [James yelling]
- [Gabi giggles]

1:32:17.910 --> 1:32:21.280
- Oh, Jamesy!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1:32:21.480 --> 1:32:22.370
[Alban] James.
What are you doing?

1:32:22.570 --> 1:32:23.590
[Gabi] James!

1:32:23.790 --> 1:32:28.590
[laughing]

1:32:28.790 --> 1:32:30.110
[James] No! No!

1:32:30.310 --> 1:32:32.030
No! No! No!

1:32:32.230 --> 1:32:33.070

1:32:39.540 --> 1:32:43.650
[Gabi] Oh, no! James!

1:32:43.850 --> 1:32:44.650
[Alban] Come on.

1:32:44.850 --> 1:32:47.220
[Gabi] Come on.

1:32:47.420 --> 1:32:48.380
[Charles] James.

1:32:49.430 --> 1:32:52.530

[rapid gunfire]

1:32:56.700 --> 1:32:58.580
Ah!

1:32:58.780 --> 1:33:00.880
[rapid gunfire continues]

1:33:01.080 --> 1:33:03.880
[grunting in pain]

1:33:07.270 --> 1:33:09.060
- [blood splattering]
- [James sobbing]

1:33:13.020 --> 1:33:14.980
[Gabi from a distance] James!

1:33:15.180 --> 1:33:16.980
[car honking]

James!

Help...

1:34:42.060 --> 1:34:44.940
[breathing heavily]

1:35:36.460 --> 1:35:37.600
No, don't--

[choking]

1:35:59.010 --> 1:36:02.060
[distorted sound plays]

1:36:07.230 --> 1:36:08.640
[Em mocking] Help me, Em.

1:36:08.840 --> 1:36:11.980
[laughs] Em, please help me.

1:36:14.150 --> 1:36:17.560

Hello?

1:37:28.230 --> 1:37:29.400
[door opens]

Hello?

1:37:38.240 --> 1:37:41.330
[crickets chirping]

1:37:49.550 --> 1:37:53.780
[suspenseful music playing]

1:38:00.700 --> 1:38:05.790
[Gabi] He emerges!
Back from the dead!

1:38:07.830 --> 1:38:12.360
[Alban] Hey. James, here.

1:38:14.490 --> 1:38:18.720
Come. It's okay.

1:38:18.920 --> 1:38:21.590
It's okay. Come forward.

1:38:27.460 --> 1:38:31.000
[Gabi] Today we're going
to fix you, James.

1:38:31.200 --> 1:38:35.520
I know it's been hard,
but believe me when I say

1:38:35.720 --> 1:38:39.000
that we are
on a mission of mercy.

1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:43.660
It's time for you to shed that
disgusting larval mind of yours

1:38:43.860 --> 1:38:46.130
and find out what kind
of a creature you really are.

1:38:51.310 --> 1:38:53.100
Bring the dog.

1:38:56.400 --> 1:38:57.450
[Bex] Come on.

1:39:17.470 --> 1:39:20.510
[inhales deeply]

1:39:23.040 --> 1:39:25.270
[growling]

1:39:25.470 --> 1:39:28.090
The dog is here for you
to complete your transformation.

1:39:30.660 --> 1:39:33.140
Only through blood
can you release your past.

1:39:58.640 --> 1:40:00.690
Sacrifice the dog, James.

1:40:07.650 --> 1:40:10.520
[panting]

1:40:14.130 --> 1:40:15.660
Kill the dog.

1:40:24.230 --> 1:40:27.450
Fuck you. Fuck all of you.

1:40:33.150 --> 1:40:34.850
Pick up the knife, James.

1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:38.110
[sniffles]

1:40:43.640 --> 1:40:45.080
It's for your own good.

1:40:54.700 --> 1:40:56.050
You pick it up.

1:41:01.400 --> 1:41:02.440
Go on.

1:41:03.880 --> 1:41:05.190
Go fetch!

1:41:05.390 --> 1:41:08.190
[screaming and grunting]

1:42:38.970 --> 1:42:41.890
[panting]

1:42:54.420 --> 1:42:56.870
Come here. It's okay.

1:42:57.070 --> 1:42:59.170
[crying]

1:43:07.390 --> 1:43:13.310
[dramatic music playing]

1:43:55.350 --> 1:43:56.400
Yeah.

1:43:57.920 --> 1:43:58.970
Mm-hm.

1:44:01.670 --> 1:44:02.970
Mm.

1:44:04.320 --> 1:44:05.290
Well, I'll land at ten,

1:44:05.490 --> 1:44:08.110
so I'll be home
around 11, 11:30.

1:44:12.020 --> 1:44:13.240
I'm so sorry, baby.

1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:17.200
Really am.

1:44:19.940 --> 1:44:24.310
Yeah.

1:44:24.510 --> 1:44:25.650
I miss you.

1:44:28.650 --> 1:44:30.530
Okay.

1:44:30.730 --> 1:44:31.880
Okay, but, I should
probably get going

1:44:32.080 --> 1:44:34.710
so I don't miss the shuttle.

1:44:34.910 --> 1:44:36.400
But I'll see you very soon.

1:44:37.660 --> 1:44:38.710
All right?

1:44:38.910 --> 1:44:40.970
I love you. Bye.

1:44:51.410 --> 1:44:52.980
[driver talking indistinctly]

1:44:53.760 --> 1:44:54.810
Thank you.

1:44:57.370 --> 1:44:58.850
Thanks.

1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:03.260
There you go.

1:45:03.460 --> 1:45:04.740
Oh, Charles,
did you remind Stacy

1:45:04.940 --> 1:45:06.520
I have a spare key
under the planter?

1:45:06.720 --> 1:45:08.310
I spoke to her yesterday.

1:45:08.510 --> 1:45:09.790
I swear it's in one ear

1:45:09.990 --> 1:45:11.130
and out the other
with that girl.

1:45:16.390 --> 1:45:19.320
Gabi, what are you two doing
when you go back to LA?

1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:21.970
Oh, well, Alban is going
straight back to work,

1:45:22.170 --> 1:45:23.020
aren't you?

1:45:23.220 --> 1:45:24.370
Oh, yes, unfortunately.

1:45:24.570 --> 1:45:26.720
The spring issue of the journal
is coming up fast,

1:45:26.920 --> 1:45:28.110
and I'm behind.

1:45:28.310 --> 1:45:29.330
Which means
I'll be eating alone

1:45:29.530 --> 1:45:31.110
and rearranging the house again.

1:45:31.310 --> 1:45:33.550
Please don't.

1:45:33.750 --> 1:45:35.550
Whenever I'm bored,
I rearrange the house

1:45:35.750 --> 1:45:36.640
and it drives Alban crazy.

1:45:36.840 --> 1:45:37.680
You don't.

1:45:37.880 --> 1:45:39.900
You and Bex must be related.

1:45:40.100 --> 1:45:41.900
I like to repaint
the walls as well.

1:45:42.100 --> 1:45:43.120
Don't give her any idea.

1:45:43.320 --> 1:45:44.730
Alban,
that actually reminds me

1:45:44.930 --> 1:45:46.740
that we need to pay Jonas for
the work he did on the garage.

1:45:46.940 --> 1:45:48.350
I paid him last month.

1:45:48.550 --> 1:45:50.830
You did? He just sent me
an invoice before we left.

1:45:51.030 --> 1:45:52.830
[woman over PA]

James, great to meet you.

Hopefully we'll see you
again next year.

1:46:13.740 --> 1:46:16.200
Have a good flight.
