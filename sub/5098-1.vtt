01:07.025 --> 01:11.404
I shall never forget
the weekend Laura died.

01:11.488 --> 01:17.201
A silver sun burned through the sky
like a huge magnifying glass.

01:17.286 --> 01:21.497
It was the hottest Sunday
in my recollection.

01:21.582 --> 01:25.668
I felt as if I were the only human being
left in New York.

01:27.463 --> 01:30.965
For with Laura's
horrible death, I was alone.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.344
I, Waldo Lydecker

01:35.429 --> 01:38.431
was the only one
who really knew her

01:40.017 --> 01:44.103
and I had just begun
to write Laura's story when

01:44.188 --> 01:47.523
another of those detectives
came to see me.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.526
I had him wait.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.282
I could watch him
through the half-open door.

02:10.005 --> 02:13.007
I noted that his attention
was fixed upon my clock.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.469
There was only one other
in existence

02:16.553 --> 02:19.263
and that was
in Laura's apartment,

02:19.473 --> 02:22.391
in the very room
where she was murdered.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.440
Careful there.
That stuff is priceless.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.610
Come in here, please.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.285
Mr. Lydecker?

02:41.370 --> 02:43.746
You recognize me. How splendid.

02:43.831 --> 02:45.832
Sit down, please.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.711
Nice little place
you have here, Mr. Lydecker.

02:50.796 --> 02:54.006
It's lavish,
but I call it home.

02:54.132 --> 02:57.260
I suppose you're here
about the Laura Hunt murder.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.595
Yesterday morning,
after Laura's body was found,

02:59.680 --> 03:02.807
I was questioned
by Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,

03:02.933 --> 03:04.934
and I stated,

03:05.018 --> 03:08.187
"On Friday night, Laura had a dinner
engagement with me"

03:08.313 --> 03:11.524
"after which she was ostensibly
going out of town."

03:11.733 --> 03:15.778
"She phoned and canceled
our engagement at exactly 7:00."

03:15.904 --> 03:17.989
- After that I...
- You "ate a lonely dinner,"

03:18.073 --> 03:21.284
"then got into the tub to read."

03:21.368 --> 03:23.160
Why did you write it down?

03:23.287 --> 03:25.538
Afraid you'd forget it?

03:25.622 --> 03:29.208
I am the most widely
misquoted man in America.

03:29.293 --> 03:31.836
When my friends do it,
I resent it.

03:31.920 --> 03:35.298
From Sergeants McAvity and Schultz,
I should find it intolerable.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.092
Hand me that washcloth,
please, Mr.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.386
Mr.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.388
McPherson.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.224
McPherson. McPherson.

03:45.309 --> 03:48.227
Mark McPherson,
the siege of Babylon, Long Island.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.593
The gangster with the machine gun.
Killed three policemen.

03:50.647 --> 03:53.107
I told the story over the air
and wrote a column about it.

03:53.191 --> 03:55.192
Are you the one
with the leg full of lead,

03:55.277 --> 03:57.570
- the man who walked right in and got him?
- Yeah.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.364
Well, well.
Hand me my robe, please.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.580
You have a pretty good memory,
Mr. Lydecker.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.459
I always liked that detective
with the silver shinbone.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.796
Thanks. I hope you won't have any reason
to change your mind about me.

04:15.881 --> 04:18.882
- Have you any more questions?
- Yeah, just one.

04:18.966 --> 04:21.427
Two years ago,
in your October 17 column,

04:21.511 --> 04:23.679
you started out
to write a book review,

04:23.764 --> 04:24.764
but at the bottom of the column,

04:24.848 --> 04:27.350
you switched over
to the Harrington murder case.

04:27.434 --> 04:31.604
Are the processes of the creative mind
now under the jurisdiction of the police?

04:31.688 --> 04:36.484
You said Harrington was rubbed out with
a shotgun loaded with buckshot,

04:36.568 --> 04:39.362
the way Laura Hunt was murdered
night before last.

04:39.446 --> 04:41.364
- Did I?
- Yeah.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.450
But he was really killed
with a sash weight.

04:44.534 --> 04:48.454
How ordinary.
My version was obviously superior.

04:48.538 --> 04:50.498
I never bother
with details, you know.

04:50.582 --> 04:53.542
I do. Well, so long.

04:54.586 --> 04:57.004
Mind if I go with you?

04:57.089 --> 05:00.633
- What for?
- Murder is my favorite crime.

05:00.717 --> 05:02.760
I write about it regularly,

05:02.844 --> 05:06.847
and I know you'll have to visit everyone
on your list of suspects.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.016
I'd like to study
their reactions.

05:09.101 --> 05:11.894
- You're on the list yourself, you know.
- Good.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.481
To have overlooked me
would have been a pointed insult.

05:15.565 --> 05:19.235
You're not the sort of man
one would insult, Mr. Lydecker.

05:19.319 --> 05:22.279
- Do you really suspect me?
- Yes.

05:22.364 --> 05:26.409
McPherson, if you know anything
about faces, look at mine.

05:28.912 --> 05:32.081
How singularly innocent
I look this morning.

05:32.708 --> 05:35.418
Have you ever seen
such candid eyes?

05:39.506 --> 05:42.675
Something you confiscated
in a raid on a kindergarten?

05:42.759 --> 05:47.013
Takes a lot of control.
Would you like to try it?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.432
No, thanks.

05:49.516 --> 05:52.351
Were you in love
with Laura Hunt, Mr. Lydecker?

05:55.105 --> 05:57.356
Was she in love with you?

05:57.441 --> 05:59.859
Laura considered me
the wisest, the wittiest,

05:59.943 --> 06:02.987
the most interesting man
she'd ever met.

06:03.071 --> 06:05.781
I was in complete accord
with her on that point.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.868
She thought me also
the kindest,

06:08.952 --> 06:11.120
the gentlest,

06:11.204 --> 06:13.622
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.292
Did you agree
with her there too?

06:16.376 --> 06:18.753
McPherson,
you won't understand this,

06:20.005 --> 06:23.549
but I tried to become
the kindest, the gentlest,

06:24.468 --> 06:26.635
the most sympathetic man
in the world.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.138
Have any luck?

06:29.222 --> 06:32.433
Let me put it this way.

06:32.601 --> 06:37.104
I should be sincerely sorry to see my
neighbors' children devoured by wolves.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.689
Shall we go?

07:03.006 --> 07:04.799
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Good morning, Mrs. Treadwell.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.133
- Waldo.
- Good morning, Ann.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.512
- I've just taken over the Laura Hunt case.
- Won't you sit down?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.598
Thanks. I have all the reports,

07:12.682 --> 07:15.059
but there are a few more questions
I'd like to ask.

07:15.143 --> 07:16.811
Certainly. I'll do anything
I can to help.

07:16.895 --> 07:19.021
You were fond of your niece,
Mrs. Treadwell?

07:19.106 --> 07:21.107
Why, I adored her. Cigarette?

07:21.191 --> 07:24.193
No, thanks. You collapsed when
you identified the body.

07:24.277 --> 07:28.364
I can quite understand that. A shotgun
loaded with buckshot, close range.

07:28.532 --> 07:31.617
- It's not very nice to look at.
- It was horrible.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.328
Her maid Bessie, I suppose
she was devoted to Miss Hunt?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.706
She worshipped her.
Laura had had her for years.

07:37.791 --> 07:40.960
I'll never forget her scream
when she saw Laura lying there.

07:41.336 --> 07:45.005
Did you approve of Miss Hunt's
coming marriage to Mr. Carpenter?

07:45.340 --> 07:48.717
Why? Shouldn't I approve?

07:48.802 --> 07:52.888
I don't know. What is your relationship
with Mr. Carpenter?

07:53.932 --> 07:54.974
What do you mean?

07:55.183 --> 07:58.060
What I mean is, he's been
a frequent guest in your home.

07:58.145 --> 08:00.896
Is he an acquaintance? Friend?
Are you in love with him?

08:01.022 --> 08:02.982
This is beginning to assume
fabulous aspects.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.818
Oh, shut up, Waldo!
What are you driving at?

08:05.986 --> 08:09.321
The truth, Mrs. Treadwell.
Are you in love with him?

08:10.949 --> 08:14.994
Why, no. I'm very fond
of Mr. Carpenter, of course.

08:15.203 --> 08:17.329
- Everybody is.
- I'm not. I'll be hanged if I am.

08:17.414 --> 08:19.832
Oh, don't be
so annoying, Waldo!

08:19.958 --> 08:21.959
Did you give
Mr. Carpenter money?

08:22.252 --> 08:23.752
What do you mean?

08:23.837 --> 08:26.237
A couple of checks went through
your account endorsed by him.

08:26.298 --> 08:31.093
One on May 15 for $250.
One on May 22 for $400.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.554
That. I...

08:34.639 --> 08:37.057
I asked him to do
some shopping for me. That's all.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.018
Shelby's a very obliging fellow.

08:39.186 --> 08:42.938
For some time, also, you've been
withdrawing various amounts in cash.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.149
Sometimes 1,500.

08:46.151 --> 08:48.110
Sometimes 1,700 at a clip.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.696
Yes. I needed that money.

08:51.865 --> 08:57.036
The day you took out $1,500,
Mr. Carpenter deposited 1,350.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.581
When you withdrew 1,700,
he deposited 1,550.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.666
Maybe they were shooting crap.

09:03.001 --> 09:05.586
Must I be insulted like this?

09:08.715 --> 09:11.967
I'm sorry, Mrs. Treadwell, but I have
to find out about these things.

09:12.510 --> 09:14.261
Shelby needed some money,
and I lent it to him.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.722
That's all. After all, it is my money.

09:16.806 --> 09:19.166
- I suppose I can do as I please with it.
- Sure. Of course.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.977
Now, on Friday night, Mrs. Treadwell,
you stayed home alone all evening?

09:22.145 --> 09:23.187
Yes.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.147
Why didn't you go to the concert
with Shelby?

09:26.483 --> 09:28.150
Because he didn't ask me.

09:28.485 --> 09:30.611
We were just talking
about you, Carpenter.

09:30.820 --> 09:33.697
- What a coincidence to find you here.
- This is Lieutenant McPherson.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.866
How do you do, Lieutenant?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.826
I didn't know you were here, Mr. Carpenter.

09:37.911 --> 09:40.329
As a matter of fact,
I was just lying down here.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.999
My hotel room was so hot, and then all
the people and reporters and telephone.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.834
You know how it is, Lieutenant.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.671
I've hardly slept a wink
since it happened.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.423
Is that a sign of guilt or innocence,
McPherson?

09:51.883 --> 09:55.135
I'm at your disposal, Lieutenant. I'm as
eager to find the murderer as you are.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.138
But what possible motive
could I have for killing Laura?

09:58.223 --> 10:00.623
Miss Hunt and I were going to be married
this week, you know.

10:00.642 --> 10:02.977
No, he doesn't know,
and neither do I,

10:03.061 --> 10:06.814
- or you or anyone else alive.
- What do you mean by that?

10:06.898 --> 10:09.775
Laura had not definitely made up
her mind to marry him.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.862
She told me so herself last Friday when she
called up to cancel our dinner engagement.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.283
As a matter of fact, she was going
to the country to think it over.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.785
She was extremely kind,
but I was always sure

10:19.869 --> 10:24.164
she would never have thrown her life
away on a male beauty in distress.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.667
I suppose you've heard
losers whine before,

10:26.751 --> 10:28.752
especially in your profession?

10:28.837 --> 10:30.517
Would you like
a bite of lunch, Lieutenant?

10:30.547 --> 10:32.589
That's very thoughtful,
the perfect host.

10:32.716 --> 10:33.966
- Waldo.
- You'd almost think

10:34.050 --> 10:35.050
he was in his own home.

10:35.218 --> 10:38.554
Shelby knows how distracted I am.
Would you, Lieutenant?

10:38.805 --> 10:40.889
Thank you, Mrs. Treadwell,
but I've got to be going.

10:41.057 --> 10:44.810
But, Lieutenant. Well, I rather thought
you'd want to ask me some questions.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.147
Yes. What did they play
at the concert Friday night?

10:48.231 --> 10:51.025
Brahms's First
and Beethoven's Ninth.

10:51.151 --> 10:54.403
Have you got a key
to Miss Hunt's house up in the country?

10:54.487 --> 10:57.281
No, but I think there's one
up in her apartment.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.908
- Okay, I'll have a look.
- Perhaps I could help you?

11:00.577 --> 11:02.328
All right. Come along.

11:02.412 --> 11:04.872
I'll be seeing you,
Mrs. Treadwell.

11:08.877 --> 11:12.004
Extra! Extra!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

11:12.088 --> 11:14.298
Extra! Girl victim
in brutal slaying!

11:14.382 --> 11:16.925
Read all about it!
Girl victim in brutal slaying!

11:17.052 --> 11:19.762
Girl victim
in brutal slaying! Read all about it!

11:24.976 --> 11:27.061
All right.
Break it up. Break it up.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.105
Ice-cold drinks!

11:57.050 --> 11:59.843
- The doorbell rang.
- What?

11:59.928 --> 12:03.222
As she opened the door,
the shot was fired.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.432
And how do you deduce that?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.769
She fell backward.
The body was there.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.439
I thought you hadn't
been up here before.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.733
I saw the police photos.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.078
I guess I better
try and find that key.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.667
McPherson, tell me, why did they have to
photograph her in that horrible condition?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.294
When a dame gets killed,
she doesn't worry about how she looks.

12:34.379 --> 12:37.464
Will you stop calling her a dame?
Look around.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.884
Is this the home of a dame?

12:42.971 --> 12:44.638
Look at her.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.352
Not bad.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.522
Jacoby was in love with her
when he painted it,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.858
but he never captured
her vibrance, her warmth.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.112
Have you ever been in love?

13:00.196 --> 13:03.198
A doll in Washington Heights
once got a fox fur out of me.

13:03.366 --> 13:06.827
Ever know a woman who wasn't
a "doll" or a "dame"?

13:09.080 --> 13:12.791
Yeah, one, but she kept walking me
past furniture windows

13:12.876 --> 13:14.793
to look at the parlor suites.

13:16.004 --> 13:18.755
- Would you mind turning that off?
- Why? Don't you like it?

13:18.840 --> 13:22.634
It was one of Laura's favorites.
Not exactly classical, but sweet.

13:23.219 --> 13:25.819
- You know a lot about music?
- I don't know a lot about anything,

13:25.889 --> 13:27.848
but I know a little
about practically everything.

13:27.932 --> 13:29.600
Yeah?

13:29.684 --> 13:31.685
Then why did you say
they played Brahms's First

13:31.769 --> 13:34.688
and Beethoven's Ninth
at the concert Friday night?

13:34.772 --> 13:37.441
They changed the program at the last
minute and played nothing but Sibelius.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.902
I suppose I should have
told you in the first place.

13:40.069 --> 13:42.696
I'd been working on that
advertising campaign with Laura.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.158
Well, we'd been working so hard,
I just couldn't keep my eyes open.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.869
I didn't hear a note at the concert.
I fell asleep.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.872
Next he'll produce
photographic evidence of his dreams.

13:51.956 --> 13:55.042
I know it sounds suspicious,
but I'm resigned to that by now.

13:55.168 --> 13:58.587
I'm a natural-born suspect just because
I'm not the conventional type.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.131
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mr. Carpenter.

14:01.257 --> 14:04.510
It sounds reasonable.
I fall asleep at concerts myself.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.178
Thank you.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.223
You found that key yet?

14:09.307 --> 14:13.018
No. I looked for it in the den,
but it wasn't there. It may be in here.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.694
Yes, here it is.

14:22.946 --> 14:25.405
I knew there must be
one around somewhere.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.116
The police are very fussy
about their inventories.

14:28.576 --> 14:31.620
That key isn't on the list of things
that were in that drawer yesterday.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.039
Then it's made
a recent reappearance.

14:35.416 --> 14:36.667
You put it there, didn't you?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.628
- Yes.
- Why?

14:39.712 --> 14:42.339
It's just that I didn't want to give it
to you while Waldo was present.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.133
I have private reasons
that don't concern him.

14:45.218 --> 14:47.135
Everything about Laura
concerns me.

14:47.804 --> 14:51.431
You have private reasons,
no doubt, to lie about the key.

14:51.516 --> 14:54.643
Waldo, for your own good,
I'm warning you to stop implying

14:54.769 --> 14:57.020
that I had anything to do
with Laura's death.

14:57.689 --> 14:59.606
Very well. I'll stop implying.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.275
I'll make a direct statement.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.859
All right, you asked for it.

15:03.486 --> 15:04.945
I wouldn't.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.865
Will you please stop dawdling
with that infernal puzzle?

15:08.992 --> 15:12.661
- It's getting on my nerves.
- I know, but it keeps me calm.

15:13.204 --> 15:14.454
Okay, let's go.

15:30.888 --> 15:33.098
This was our table,

15:33.182 --> 15:34.850
Laura's and mine.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.520
We spent many quiet evenings
here together.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.067
I remember we dined here the night
before her 22nd birthday.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.487
Just we two,

15:47.572 --> 15:51.366
happy, making plans
for her future.

15:52.702 --> 15:53.660
Good luck.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.621
But this was a far cry

15:55.705 --> 16:00.542
from the girl who walked into my life
at the Algonquin Hotel five years before.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.212
Pardon me. Excuse me.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.467
Excuse me.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.562
Mr. Lydecker, how do you do?

16:20.647 --> 16:24.191
My name is Laura Hunt,
and I'm with Bullitt and Company.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.610
You know,
the big advertising firm.

16:26.694 --> 16:29.613
And I'd like to talk
something over with you, if I may.

16:29.697 --> 16:33.909
You can hardly fail to realize that
I am engaged in eating my lunch.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.788
Yes, I know. I'm awfully sorry
to interrupt this way

16:37.872 --> 16:40.957
but it's so hard to get to see you
the regular way, and

16:41.042 --> 16:43.043
this will only
take a minute, really.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.006
- Now, this is...
- Young woman,

16:48.549 --> 16:52.344
either you have been raised
in some incredibly rustic community

16:52.679 --> 16:54.388
where good manners are unknown

16:54.681 --> 16:57.099
or you suffer from the common
feminine delusion

16:57.183 --> 16:58.934
that the mere fact
of being a woman

16:59.018 --> 17:02.104
exempts you from the rules
of civilized conduct.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.856
Or possibly both.

17:04.982 --> 17:07.818
Possibly, but here's
what I wanted to show you.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.028
It's for
the Wallace Flow-Rite pen.

17:10.113 --> 17:14.199
I know my company would be glad to pay
you $5,000 if you'll endorse the ad.

17:14.282 --> 17:16.242
I don't use a pen.

17:16.411 --> 17:18.369
I write with a goose quill
dipped in venom.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.748
Yes, but this is a very fine pen,
Mr. Lydecker,

17:21.833 --> 17:23.458
the best on the market.

17:23.626 --> 17:26.502
Wouldn't you at least
consider endorsing it?

17:26.587 --> 17:30.549
I'll neither consider, endorse
or use the Wallace pen.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.884
I hate pens.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.346
If your employers wish me to publish
that statement in my column,

17:36.639 --> 17:39.391
you may tell them that I shall be
delighted to oblige.

17:40.017 --> 17:43.145
Oh, no. You mustn't do that.

17:43.396 --> 17:45.856
Don't blame Bullitt and Company,
Mr. Lydecker.

17:45.940 --> 17:49.651
They don't know anything about this.
It was my idea to see you.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.487
Indeed?

17:52.572 --> 17:56.908
Yes. I know they'd give anything down
at the office to get your endorsement,

17:56.993 --> 17:58.869
only they think
there's no use asking.

17:58.995 --> 18:02.080
So I had this ad made up
all on my own

18:02.206 --> 18:05.625
because I thought, well,
what's the harm in trying?

18:05.710 --> 18:08.128
There was always a chance
that you might, Mr. Lydecker.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.005
Just think what
it would mean...

18:10.089 --> 18:11.923
You seem to be completely disregarding

18:12.008 --> 18:14.342
something more important
than your career.

18:14.427 --> 18:17.053
- What?
- My lunch.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.725
Do you really believe that?

18:21.851 --> 18:24.394
Implicitly.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.980
I never heard
of anything so selfish.

18:28.024 --> 18:31.943
In my case, self-absorption
is completely justified.

18:32.028 --> 18:35.322
I have never discovered any other
subject quite so worthy of my attention.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.866
But you write about people

18:37.950 --> 18:41.328
with such real understanding
and sentiment.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.915
That's what makes
your column so good.

18:45.708 --> 18:48.627
Sentiment comes easily
at 50 cents a word.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.214
Well, if that's the way
you really feel,

18:53.174 --> 18:54.966
you must be very lonely.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.554
Will you kindly continue
this character analysis elsewhere?

19:00.431 --> 19:03.350
- You begin to bore me.
- You're a poor man.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.019
I'm very sorry for you.

19:08.940 --> 19:11.691
Naturally,
I was annoyed by the incident,

19:12.443 --> 19:14.820
but she had something
about her, that girl.

19:16.197 --> 19:20.283
I had to speak to her again.
I had to see her.

19:20.576 --> 19:22.536
- Miss, would you mind if I...
- Just a moment, please.

19:22.620 --> 19:24.996
I'll tell Mr. Bullitt right away.
He's on the telephone.

19:25.122 --> 19:27.207
Thank you.

19:47.979 --> 19:51.565
Boy, Waldo Lydecker
to see Miss Laura Hunt.

19:53.609 --> 19:54.985
Announce me.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.822
Johnny, please tell
the gentleman I'm busy.

20:03.828 --> 20:07.414
Miss Hunt, I have something
to say to you.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.332
You've already said it,
Mr. Lydecker.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.336
I wish to point out that you caught me
at my most difficult moment.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.798
Ordinarily I am not
without a heart.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.508
Really?

20:18.634 --> 20:21.136
Shall I produce
X-ray pictures to prove it?

20:24.682 --> 20:26.558
I wish to apologize.

20:26.934 --> 20:28.685
Your apology is accepted.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.148
Good-bye, Mr. Lydecker.

20:33.316 --> 20:35.609
If you come
a little bit closer, my boy,

20:35.693 --> 20:37.902
I can just crack your skull
with my stick.

20:42.199 --> 20:46.494
And now, for reasons
which are too embarrassing to mention,

20:46.579 --> 20:48.079
I'd like to endorse that pen.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.541
Mr. Lydecker!

20:51.751 --> 20:53.209
Thank you.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.506
- You're a very strange man.
- What?

20:59.467 --> 21:02.552
You're really sorry
for the way you acted, aren't you?

21:03.638 --> 21:06.139
Let's not be psychiatric,
Miss Hunt,

21:06.223 --> 21:08.850
but in a word, yes.

21:10.394 --> 21:12.187
It's very kind of you,
you know.

21:12.396 --> 21:15.190
I'm not kind. I'm vicious.
It's the secret of my charm.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.779
But if you choose
to think me kind,

21:21.864 --> 21:23.698
I'll call for you at 6:00.

21:25.618 --> 21:27.619
All right?

21:28.329 --> 21:30.080
All right.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.961
Her career began
with my endorsement of the pen.

21:37.046 --> 21:39.881
I secured other endorsements for her,

21:39.965 --> 21:42.342
introduced her
to important clients.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.887
I gave her her start

21:46.097 --> 21:48.139
but it was her own talent
and imagination

21:48.224 --> 21:51.142
that enabled her to rise
to the top of her profession

21:51.227 --> 21:52.602
and stay there.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.731
She had an eager mind always.

21:57.692 --> 22:01.236
She was always quick to seize upon
anything that would improve her mind...

22:01.445 --> 22:02.987
or her appearance.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.908
Laura had innate breeding.

22:11.789 --> 22:14.457
But she deferred
to my judgment and taste.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.420
I selected a more attractive
hairdress for her.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.884
I taught her what clothes
were more becoming to her.

22:26.887 --> 22:29.139
Through me, she met everyone.

22:29.724 --> 22:31.766
The famous and the infamous.

22:32.476 --> 22:36.896
Her youth and beauty, her poise
and charm of manner...

22:36.981 --> 22:38.356
captivated them all.

22:39.233 --> 22:42.026
She had warmth, vitality.

22:42.820 --> 22:45.029
She had authentic magnetism.

22:46.615 --> 22:49.284
Wherever we went,
she stood out.

22:50.119 --> 22:53.163
Men admired her.
Women envied her.

22:54.081 --> 22:57.959
She became as well known
as Waldo Lydecker's walking stick...

22:58.252 --> 22:59.878
and his white carnation.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.172
But Tuesday and Friday nights,

23:02.256 --> 23:05.759
we stayed home, dining quietly

23:05.843 --> 23:08.052
listening to my records.

23:08.429 --> 23:10.597
I read my articles to her.

23:11.474 --> 23:14.476
The way she listened
was more eloquent than speech.

23:16.937 --> 23:18.646
These were the best nights.

23:20.524 --> 23:23.651
Then one Tuesday, she phoned
and said she couldn't come.

23:25.154 --> 23:26.905
It didn't matter, really.

23:27.782 --> 23:30.867
But when it happened again
the following Friday, I was disturbed.

23:33.662 --> 23:37.957
I couldn't
understand it. I felt betrayed

23:38.167 --> 23:41.127
and yet I knew Laura
would never betray anyone.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.844
I walked for a long time.

23:52.181 --> 23:55.350
Then I found myself
before her apartment building.

23:55.851 --> 24:00.104
The lights were on.
It pleased me to know she was home,

24:00.523 --> 24:02.565
till I saw she was not alone.

24:05.027 --> 24:09.239
But I waited.
I wanted to see who he was.

24:13.869 --> 24:17.330
It was Jacoby, who had recently
painted her portrait.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.749
I never liked the man.

24:19.875 --> 24:24.546
He was so obviously conscious of looking
more like an athlete than an artist.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.799
I sat up the rest of the night
writing a column about him.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.093
I demolished his affectations,

24:30.219 --> 24:33.555
exposed his camouflaged
imitations of better painters,

24:33.806 --> 24:36.015
ridiculed his theories.

24:36.392 --> 24:39.727
I did it for her,
knowing Jacoby was unworthy of her.

24:39.854 --> 24:43.231
It was a masterpiece
because it was a labor of love.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.901
Naturally, she could never
regard him seriously again.

24:48.404 --> 24:51.406
There were others, of course,

24:51.574 --> 24:53.533
but her own discrimination
ruled them out

24:53.617 --> 24:56.077
before it became necessary
for me to intercede

24:58.038 --> 25:00.999
until one night at a party
at Ann Treadwell's.

25:01.333 --> 25:05.253
It was one of her usual roundups
of bizarre and nondescript characters

25:05.379 --> 25:08.140
- corralled from every stratum of society.
- How are you this evening?

25:08.173 --> 25:10.925
This is Mr. and Mrs. Preston.
They've been waiting to meet you.

25:11.010 --> 25:12.552
How do you do?

25:15.598 --> 25:17.390
- Hello, Shelby.
- Excuse me, honey.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.771
You're Laura Hunt.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.901
- Yes?
- Hello. I'm Shelby Carpenter.

25:27.985 --> 25:31.070
- Want to dance?
- I'm not alone.

25:32.948 --> 25:35.742
Oh, him? I'll bet
he's still doing the polka.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.119
Excuse me, please. Yes.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.455
Betsy Ross taught it to me.

25:40.581 --> 25:43.082
- Hello, Waldo. Darling, how are you?
- Hello, darling.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.542
- I see you've met Shelby.
- Hello, Ann.

25:44.627 --> 25:46.878
- Unavoidably.
- He was awfully nice to me in Louisville

25:46.962 --> 25:49.297
at the Derby. His family's from Kentucky.

25:50.132 --> 25:52.050
Sharecroppers, no doubt.

25:57.139 --> 26:00.266
Louise. Louise, for the last time,
will you marry me?

26:00.351 --> 26:02.518
I won't, but I've saved
some chicken livers for you.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.646
You're an angel.
In the meantime, darling,

26:04.730 --> 26:06.814
you think you could
get this spot out for me?

26:06.899 --> 26:09.609
I can afford a blemish on my character
but not on my clothes.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.612
- Couldn't eat another mouthful.
- I'm afraid it's rouge.

26:12.696 --> 26:14.697
- I'm afraid it's liquor.
- Louise.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.699
May I have a glass of
milk for Mr. Lydecker?

26:16.784 --> 26:17.784
Of course, Miss Hunt.

26:17.868 --> 26:19.744
I forgot to tell you.
I also read palms.

26:19.828 --> 26:24.040
I cook, I swallow swords, I mend my own
socks, I never eat garlic or onions.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.917
What more can you want
of a man?

26:26.001 --> 26:29.087
- Don't listen to that scalawag.
- I didn't expect to find him here, Louise.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.880
What do you mean?
We're old friends.

26:30.965 --> 26:32.757
She feeds me,
humors me, repairs me

26:32.841 --> 26:34.926
and refuses to marry me,
don't you, honey?

26:35.010 --> 26:36.928
- I do.
- She has good sense.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.597
- Now, wait just a minute. Thanks, Louise.
- You're wasting your time.

26:39.682 --> 26:41.975
- She's got good sense too.
- You're jealous.

26:44.353 --> 26:46.646
And what does it feel like,
Mr. Carpenter?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.565
What does what feel like,
Miss Hunt?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.151
Living on the income
from an estate.

26:52.486 --> 26:54.404
- Well, I...
- Or don't you know?

26:54.530 --> 26:58.074
Well, I did, until the sheriff
took it over 10 years ago.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.035
Why maintain the fiction?
Why not work?

27:01.120 --> 27:04.288
Believe it or not, I asked
one of my many friends for a job once,

27:04.373 --> 27:07.458
executive of a big company,
2,500 employees.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.794
He could have pressed a button
and done it, but he just laughed.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.963
- He thought I was joking.
- Weren't you?

27:12.047 --> 27:15.091
No. When I convinced him, he got
embarrassed, said he'd phone me.

27:15.175 --> 27:19.303
That was months ago. Now whenever
he sees me, he looks the other way.

27:27.521 --> 27:30.148
- Do you really want a job?
- Yes.

27:33.235 --> 27:35.236
Here you are.

27:35.320 --> 27:38.614
Laura, dear, I cannot stand
these morons any longer.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.868
If you don't come with me
this instant, I shall run amok.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.412
All right, Waldo.

27:45.914 --> 27:48.124
10:30 tomorrow,
Bullitt and Company.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.793
You've got a job.

27:51.712 --> 27:55.339
I concealed my
annoyance with masterly self-control,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.761
but I sensed a situation
which would bear watching.

28:00.387 --> 28:03.014
Laura, take a look at this.

28:04.266 --> 28:07.769
Do you like it? Do you think it'll make
people want to bathe more often?

28:08.145 --> 28:10.521
It should. It's excellent.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.024
- There you are.
- Good night, Miss Hunt.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.192
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. Carpenter.

28:14.276 --> 28:17.361
- Good night, honey.
- It's really very good. Who's the model?

28:17.446 --> 28:20.323
A girl named Diane Redfern.
You hired her yourself last week.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.783
- Don't you remember?
- Oh, yeah.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.869
Well, let's go, moon of my delight.
I am starved.

28:25.329 --> 28:26.788
You usually are.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.624
- I approve of that hat.
- You do?

28:30.459 --> 28:31.834
And the girl in it too.

28:32.503 --> 28:34.087
Thank you.

28:37.633 --> 28:39.467
I knew there was
something on my mind.

28:39.593 --> 28:42.887
What is it? Oh, yes.
Will you dine with me tomorrow night?

28:43.138 --> 28:45.556
- Maybe.
- No, that isn't what's worrying me.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.641
- It's the next night.
- But, Shelby, I can't be...

28:47.643 --> 28:51.229
Good. What about three weeks from
tonight and all the nights in between?

28:51.313 --> 28:52.897
Don't you think
I have any other engagements?

28:52.981 --> 28:56.234
What about two months
from now and the month after that?

28:56.318 --> 28:59.529
- What about next year?
- That's all settled. What about breakfast?

29:00.489 --> 29:02.323
What about dancing?

29:02.407 --> 29:04.325
What about lunch?
Beautiful lunches

29:04.451 --> 29:07.245
- day after day after day after day?
- What about work?

29:07.329 --> 29:10.456
Beautiful work,
day after day after day?

29:10.541 --> 29:12.250
Why, Miss Hunt,
the way you talk.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.377
You'd think I was in love with you.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.510
Yes, Laura,
I heard everything he said.

29:26.014 --> 29:27.557
I went to call for you.

29:29.393 --> 29:30.852
I'm sorry, Waldo.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.521
And that reminds me.

29:35.983 --> 29:38.693
Old Mother Hubbard has
something in the cupboard.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.114
The results of
my private investigation

29:43.198 --> 29:45.700
of that sterling character,
Mr. Shelby Carpenter.

29:47.744 --> 29:50.246
By stooping so low, you only
degrade yourself, Waldo.

29:51.999 --> 29:55.585
Did you know that he almost went to jail
for passing rubber checks,

29:55.669 --> 29:58.129
that he was suspected of stealing
his hostess's jewels

29:58.213 --> 30:00.131
when he was a house-guest
in Virginia?

30:00.257 --> 30:02.925
Naturally they'd suspect him,
because he isn't rich.

30:03.927 --> 30:06.137
Those are only insinuations,

30:06.221 --> 30:08.389
the cheapest kind.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.100
These aren't only
insinuations, my dear.

30:11.226 --> 30:13.227
There you are. Read them.

30:15.105 --> 30:17.148
What of it?

30:17.232 --> 30:21.277
I know his faults.
A man can change, can't he?

30:21.361 --> 30:24.405
People are always ready
to hold out a hand to slap you down,

30:24.489 --> 30:26.407
but never to pick you up.

30:26.867 --> 30:28.576
All right, I'm helping Shelby.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.745
His past is his own affair.

30:30.871 --> 30:33.664
I only care about the present.

30:33.999 --> 30:37.126
Speaking of the changed Mr. Carpenter
in the present tense,

30:38.587 --> 30:41.380
he's now running around
with a model from your own office.

30:41.465 --> 30:43.716
Her name is Diane Redfern.

30:45.886 --> 30:49.222
I'm closer to despising you
than I thought I ever would be.

30:55.938 --> 30:59.148
I'm sorry. I should have
told you before.

30:59.733 --> 31:02.318
Shelby and I are going to be
married next week.

31:06.573 --> 31:09.784
I believe you presented him with
a cigarette case on his last birthday.

31:14.206 --> 31:15.665
Rather valuable, isn't it?

31:15.749 --> 31:17.291
Where did you get it?

31:17.501 --> 31:20.419
From the pawnshop where Diane Redfern
took it after he gave it to her.

31:21.046 --> 31:24.465
I don't believe it. He probably needed
money and was too proud to borrow.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.092
Carpenter proud?

31:27.719 --> 31:30.304
Perhaps that's why
the pawn ticket was in her name.

31:30.472 --> 31:32.313
Before this goes any further,
why, I'll just...

31:34.601 --> 31:36.060
He isn't home.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.153
He's dining at Ann Treadwell's.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.447
He can't be.
He asked me to dinner.

31:48.657 --> 31:52.243
He would have canceled his appointment
with her if you had accepted.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.120
He treats her
rather badly these days.

31:56.999 --> 31:59.125
I'm afraid she'll say
he isn't there.

32:08.635 --> 32:10.636
Waldo,

32:11.847 --> 32:13.472
why are you doing this?

32:19.062 --> 32:20.896
For you, Laura.

32:22.941 --> 32:24.525
Shall we pay them a visit?

32:25.861 --> 32:29.405
He won't be there, Waldo.
I know he won't.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.949
All right. We'll see.

32:34.202 --> 32:37.204
Don't you want to take this little
bauble along in case he is there?

32:46.548 --> 32:47.748
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

32:47.841 --> 32:50.676
- I'm sorry. Mrs. Treadwell is not home.
- We know, dear.

33:03.398 --> 33:05.066
Good evening.

33:10.447 --> 33:13.449
Hello, darling. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

33:13.658 --> 33:15.076
There you are, my dear.

33:15.494 --> 33:18.162
In a moment of supreme disaster,
he's trite.

33:18.246 --> 33:21.082
You've been reading
too many melodramas, Waldo.

33:21.792 --> 33:24.168
I was just telling Ann
about our getting married.

33:25.045 --> 33:26.796
Well, have you two had dinner?

33:27.839 --> 33:29.298
Would you like a glass of wine?

33:29.424 --> 33:31.008
Why don't you sit down?

33:40.185 --> 33:44.021
I couldn't find out
if she saw Carpenter in the meantime.

33:44.231 --> 33:47.775
All I know is that on Friday
she had lunch with Diane Redfern.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.987
What came
of it, I hoped to hear that night.

33:52.155 --> 33:53.572
I alternated between moods of

33:53.657 --> 33:55.533
overoptimism and over-pessimism.

33:55.617 --> 33:58.119
When the phone rang,
I had a foreboding of disaster.

34:02.958 --> 34:05.584
I called to tell you, Waldo,
I'm frightfully sorry.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.045
I can't have dinner
with you tonight.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.674
Oh, no, no. I'm not sick.
I'm just dreadfully nervous.

34:11.757 --> 34:14.342
I'm going to the country
for a few days.

34:14.594 --> 34:16.512
Yes. I'm afraid
it's about Shelby.

34:17.556 --> 34:19.764
Oh, no. Please.
There's nothing you can do.

34:19.850 --> 34:22.351
I've got to think
this thing out for myself.

34:22.561 --> 34:26.647
I'm sorry. I'll call you
when I get back. Good-bye.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.609
It was the last time
I ever heard her voice.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.905
I was sure she had
too much pride to forgive him.

34:36.658 --> 34:38.159
But...

34:39.077 --> 34:41.495
Where does
this Diane Redfern live?

34:42.164 --> 34:44.540
Brooklyn somewhere.
She's in the phone book.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.835
Come on. It's late.
Let's get going.

34:49.838 --> 34:51.839
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir.

34:55.010 --> 34:57.011
- All right.
- Thank you, Mr. Lydecker.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.017
Good night.

35:07.147 --> 35:10.357
I shall never forgive myself for
letting her become involved with Shelby.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.027
It was my fault.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.030
I should have
stopped it somehow.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.365
Well, it's too late now.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.246
Thanks for the wine.

35:43.099 --> 35:45.184
Hello. Mosconi's?

35:45.268 --> 35:48.521
This is Lieutenant McPherson,
Homicide Bureau.

35:48.605 --> 35:52.691
Laura Hunt had been buying her liquor
from you for several years, hadn't she?

35:52.776 --> 35:54.985
Yeah.

35:55.070 --> 35:58.364
Did she ever buy a brand of scotch
called Black Pony?

35:59.991 --> 36:01.909
Yeah.

36:03.078 --> 36:05.704
I see.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.915
Well, that's all
I wanted to know. Thanks.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.917
She's here, McPherson,
the maid.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.461
Okay.

36:12.546 --> 36:15.297
- Come in, Miss Clary.
- Never mind the "Miss Clary" stuff.

36:15.382 --> 36:19.218
My name's Bessie, and I'm a domestic,
and I got nothin' to be ashamed of.

36:19.302 --> 36:21.387
Sit down, Bessie.

36:22.305 --> 36:24.390
Her letters.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.600
And her private diary.

36:27.769 --> 36:30.104
You've been reading them,
pawing over them.

36:30.188 --> 36:33.107
It's a shame in the face of the dead.
That's what it is. It's a shame.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.026
- Sit down, Bessie.
- I'll stand on my own two feet.

36:36.111 --> 36:38.195
Don't you go
ordering me around.

36:38.280 --> 36:42.825
I ain't afraid of cops. I was
brought up to spit whenever I saw one.

36:42.909 --> 36:46.745
Okay, go ahead and spit
if that'll make you feel better.

36:52.627 --> 36:54.753
What do you want to know?

36:54.838 --> 36:57.172
What we all want to know,
who killed Laura Hunt.

36:57.257 --> 36:58.924
How would I know?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.386
You don't think I done it?

37:03.054 --> 37:05.931
I know you cops
get crazy notions,

37:06.016 --> 37:08.392
but if you got any notion
concerning me...

37:08.476 --> 37:11.895
Ask anyone,
anyone who ever come to this house.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.897
I would have worked for her.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.899
I would have washed,
ironed, scrubbed,

37:15.984 --> 37:19.695
done everything she wanted of me,
whether she paid me for it or not.

37:19.779 --> 37:23.741
And it wasn't only on account of the
thousand sweet things she done for me.

37:23.825 --> 37:26.368
It was because she was
so sweet herself,

37:26.453 --> 37:29.330
because she was
a real fine lady.

37:30.832 --> 37:34.668
But you cops
wouldn't know about that.

37:34.961 --> 37:40.257
But you do. That's all the more reason
why you should help me, Bessie.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.427
Do you happen to know how this got into
her liquor cabinet?

37:44.846 --> 37:46.847
I put it there.

37:47.015 --> 37:50.351
But she never bought cheap stuff like
that, not a lady like Miss Hunt.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.437
- No.
- When did you put it in the cabinet?

37:53.521 --> 37:55.439
- Saturday.
- Before the police came.

37:55.523 --> 37:59.026
- Was it there Friday night before you left?
- No.

37:59.152 --> 38:01.236
Are you sure of that?

38:01.446 --> 38:04.114
I cleaned out
the cabinet on Friday

38:04.199 --> 38:06.200
and put the empties
in the basement.

38:07.452 --> 38:09.953
Then somebody was with her
in the apartment Friday night,

38:10.038 --> 38:11.955
someone
who brought that bottle.

38:12.040 --> 38:13.749
- Yes.
- Who?

38:13.833 --> 38:16.377
I don't know,
but I didn't want anyone

38:16.461 --> 38:19.755
getting any wrong ideas about her,
God rest her soul.

38:20.507 --> 38:22.841
That's why I took it out of the bedroom
and put it in the cabinet

38:22.926 --> 38:24.885
before the police got here.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.471
And that ain't all I done.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.641
I washed out the glasses
and cleaned off the bottle too.

38:30.725 --> 38:32.768
Do you know what happens to people
who destroy evidence?

38:32.852 --> 38:34.228
I don't care.

38:35.980 --> 38:38.357
You ain't gonna tell
the newspaper reporters, are ya,

38:38.441 --> 38:40.401
and let them make up
their nasty stories

38:40.527 --> 38:42.111
and drag her name
through the mud?

38:43.571 --> 38:46.031
Go ahead,
but it won't do you any good.

38:46.116 --> 38:48.992
- I'll say you lied. I'll say...
- Take it easy, Bessie.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.413
Get me some ice
and a setup, will you?

38:52.539 --> 38:54.581
All right.

38:54.666 --> 38:56.750
A couple of highball glasses.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.590
Good morning.
Lieutenant McPherson sent for us.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.592
- Good morning, Lieutenant.
- Hello, McPherson.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.845
This is quite a delegation.
I only sent for you, Carpenter.

39:07.929 --> 39:09.096
- I know.
- Shelby's dropping me off

39:09.180 --> 39:10.347
at the hairdresser's later,

39:10.432 --> 39:13.726
- so I thought I might as well come along.
- My excuse is equally feeble.

39:14.060 --> 39:16.228
I just popped in
to pay my dubious respects

39:16.312 --> 39:18.313
and inquire as to
the state of your health.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.024
- Insipid, I trust.
- I was just going to pour myself a drink.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.360
- Care to join me?
- A very nice idea.

39:23.445 --> 39:24.645
Shelby, wouldn't you like one?

39:24.654 --> 39:26.155
- I'll get it.
- Never mind.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.781
Bessie, would you bring
a couple more glasses?

39:27.907 --> 39:29.575
- Yes, sir.
- Hi, Bessie.

39:29.659 --> 39:30.951
What are you doing here?

39:31.035 --> 39:33.537
I'm paid up for the week,
and I'm working, regardless.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.874
- Would you like one, Lydecker?
- I see no reason to exclude myself

39:36.958 --> 39:38.417
if the host provides scotch.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.878
- This do?
- I presume it'll have to.

39:40.962 --> 39:43.130
How about you, Carpenter?
It's cheap, but it's potent.

39:43.214 --> 39:46.800
As a matter of fact, I don't think I care
for any. I'm not much of a daytime drinker.

39:46.885 --> 39:49.428
That'll be all for you,
Bessie. You can go home now.

39:49.512 --> 39:51.180
But I... Yes, sir.

39:53.391 --> 39:54.850
I remember when Laura
bought these glasses.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.227
She loved them.
She loved all her things so.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.063
What are you going to do?
Sell them?

40:00.148 --> 40:03.066
I don't know.
I suppose so. Thank you.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.526
If I'm appointed
administrator of the estate,

40:04.611 --> 40:06.945
I shall probably just call in Corey.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.114
You mean Lancaster Corey,
the art dealer?

40:09.199 --> 40:11.283
Yes. He was
a friend of Laura's.

40:11.367 --> 40:14.536
Let him dispose of everything.
It'll be less gruesome that way.

40:14.662 --> 40:17.706
Not quite everything, Ann.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.042
Two or three things in here
belong to me.

40:20.210 --> 40:22.669
This vase, for instance,

40:23.338 --> 40:25.506
and that clock, of course,

40:26.466 --> 40:28.217
and the antique fire screen.

40:28.510 --> 40:30.844
- I only lent them to Laura, you know.
- Oh, really, Waldo.

40:30.970 --> 40:35.307
Yes, really. This vase is the gem of my
collection. I intend to have it back.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.600
And the clock and the screen too.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.686
But they aren't yours. You gave them
to Laura. I won't permit it.

40:39.854 --> 40:42.356
Does an alleged fiancé
have any voice in this matter?

40:43.191 --> 40:44.608
I'll take the vase with me now

40:44.692 --> 40:48.195
and send someone to collect
the other things this very day.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.490
Nothing is leaving here
except you, Lydecker.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.910
Is that your quaint way
of indicating dismissal?

40:55.703 --> 40:58.705
We're all going anyway. I have to be
back at headquarters by noon.

40:58.790 --> 41:02.543
Lieutenant, I don't understand.
You sent for me, didn't you?

41:02.752 --> 41:04.419
- Yeah.
- Well, don't you want to see me?

41:04.546 --> 41:07.214
- Don't you want to ask me some questions?
- I'll be seeing you.

41:07.382 --> 41:09.132
- Well...
- I bid you good day.

41:09.259 --> 41:10.425
Come along, Shelby.

41:10.510 --> 41:13.053
Are you making any progress
on the case, Lieutenant?

41:14.973 --> 41:16.431
We're doing all right.

41:32.824 --> 41:35.617
- Hello, Mark.
- Go get something to eat. I'll take over.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.327
- Thanks.
- Take your time.

44:37.216 --> 44:38.842
Fred?

44:43.931 --> 44:46.266
- Yes?
- What's the matter? Did you go to sleep?

44:46.768 --> 44:49.227
This is McPherson.
Any calls come through?

44:50.855 --> 44:52.481
Well, keep listening.

44:52.857 --> 44:54.566
No. Nothing new.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.116
I happened to see
the lights on.

45:04.786 --> 45:06.495
Have you sublet this apartment?

45:06.579 --> 45:08.538
You're here often enough
to pay rent.

45:08.748 --> 45:11.124
- Any objections?
- Yes.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.044
I object to you prying
into Laura's letters,

45:14.212 --> 45:15.796
especially those from me.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.049
- Why? Yours are the best in the bunch.
- Thanks.

45:19.258 --> 45:20.967
But I didn't write them to you.

45:21.844 --> 45:24.262
Haven't you any sense
of privacy?

45:25.223 --> 45:28.058
Murder victims have
no claim to privacy.

45:28.476 --> 45:32.020
Have detectives who buy portraits
of murder victims a claim to privacy?

45:33.940 --> 45:37.234
Lancaster Corey told me
that you've already put in a bid for it.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.528
That's none of your business.

45:39.904 --> 45:43.365
McPherson, did it ever strike you
that you're acting very strangely?

45:43.825 --> 45:47.369
It's a wonder you don't come here like a
suitor, with roses and a box of candy,

45:47.578 --> 45:49.579
drugstore candy, of course.

45:50.623 --> 45:53.083
Have you ever dreamed
of Laura as your wife,

45:53.167 --> 45:56.586
by your side at the policeman's ball,
or in the bleachers,

45:56.671 --> 45:59.673
or listening to the heroic story of how
you got a silver shinbone

45:59.757 --> 46:01.299
from a gun battle
with a gangster?

46:03.594 --> 46:06.304
- I see you have.
- Why don't you go home? I'm busy.

46:08.349 --> 46:10.100
Perhaps we can
come to terms now.

46:11.686 --> 46:14.980
You want the portrait.
Perfectly understandable.

46:15.064 --> 46:18.483
I want my possessions,
my vase, my clock and my screen.

46:18.568 --> 46:20.902
Also perfectly understandable.
Now, if you...

46:21.028 --> 46:22.571
Get going.

46:22.864 --> 46:26.366
You better watch out, McPherson,
or you'll end up in a psychiatric ward.

46:27.410 --> 46:31.371
I don't think they've ever had a patient
who fell in love with a corpse.

48:02.129 --> 48:03.630
What are you doing here?

48:06.968 --> 48:08.301
You're alive.

48:09.262 --> 48:11.638
If you don't get out at once,
I'm going to call the police.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.765
You are Laura Hunt, aren't you?

48:16.852 --> 48:18.270
Aren't you?

48:18.396 --> 48:21.022
- I'm going to call the police.
- Well, I am the police.

48:22.149 --> 48:23.692
Mark McPherson.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.195
What's this all about?

48:28.823 --> 48:30.240
Don't you know?

48:30.324 --> 48:32.325
- Don't you know what's happened?
- No.

48:33.995 --> 48:36.371
Haven't you seen the papers?
Where have you been?

48:37.665 --> 48:40.583
Up in the country.
I don't get a newspaper.

48:41.502 --> 48:45.005
- Haven't you got a radio?
- It was broken.

48:45.214 --> 48:46.673
What...

49:05.192 --> 49:07.736
Somebody was murdered
in this room.

49:07.945 --> 49:09.863
Do you have any idea
who it was?

49:10.156 --> 49:11.865
No.

49:11.949 --> 49:14.117
Who had a key
to your apartment?

49:14.702 --> 49:16.745
Nobody.

49:16.871 --> 49:18.830
Are you sure?

49:19.582 --> 49:22.334
- When did it happen?
- Friday night.

49:26.255 --> 49:28.048
What are you going to do now?

49:28.382 --> 49:30.550
Find out who was murdered

49:30.676 --> 49:32.719
and then find the murderer.

49:36.474 --> 49:39.476
You'd better take off those wet clothes.
You might catch cold.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.191
Yeah.

49:55.659 --> 49:57.660
I found this in my closet.

49:57.745 --> 49:59.662
It's Diane Redfern's.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.624
It wasn't here when I left.
She's one of our models.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.417
Just about my size.

50:07.129 --> 50:08.755
Beautiful, wasn't she?

50:09.090 --> 50:10.632
Do you suppose...

50:14.804 --> 50:16.596
Sit down, please.

50:20.935 --> 50:23.603
This is Monday night.
You left on Friday.

50:24.021 --> 50:27.399
- Rather a long weekend, isn't it?
- Yes.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.442
What train did you take?

50:30.069 --> 50:31.611
The 7:26.

50:31.946 --> 50:34.447
- See anybody you knew on the train?
- No.

50:35.116 --> 50:38.701
- Then what?
- Then I got off the train at Norwalk.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.204
Saw nobody you knew
at the station either?

50:41.288 --> 50:42.580
No.

50:43.082 --> 50:44.416
Go on.

50:44.500 --> 50:47.293
Then I went to the garage
where I keep my car.

50:47.461 --> 50:51.172
It's a private garage.
Nobody saw me there either.

50:51.841 --> 50:53.133
Then I drove to my house.

50:54.009 --> 50:55.885
You were there three days.
What did you do?

50:56.387 --> 50:58.012
Work in my garden.

50:59.265 --> 51:00.890
You didn't go out
in all that time?

51:01.308 --> 51:04.060
No. I had everything
I needed in the house.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.272
- Nobody came to see you?
- Nobody.

51:07.565 --> 51:09.065
I went there to be alone.

51:10.109 --> 51:12.509
Police were there on Saturday.
There was no one in the house.

51:13.821 --> 51:16.781
Oh, yes. Saturday,
I took a long walk.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.159
I walked for hours
in the woods.

51:21.328 --> 51:24.330
You were going to
marry Shelby Carpenter this week.

51:24.707 --> 51:26.166
Thursday, if I'm not mistaken.

51:29.170 --> 51:30.462
Yes.

51:30.963 --> 51:33.214
Yet you went away
just before your wedding,

51:33.340 --> 51:35.633
for a long weekend to be alone.

51:36.469 --> 51:38.928
I was tired.
I'd been working hard.

51:39.013 --> 51:42.265
You know Shelby Carpenter has a key to
this apartment. Why didn't you tell me?

51:42.349 --> 51:44.601
I know nothing of the sort.
He hasn't.

51:44.685 --> 51:46.686
How else did the girl
get into the apartment?

51:46.937 --> 51:50.482
You knew she was in love with Carpenter,
that he'd given her your cigarette case.

51:50.566 --> 51:51.983
You know all that, don't you?

51:52.151 --> 51:54.944
I knew that she was in love with him.
She told me so herself.

51:55.070 --> 51:58.281
- When did she tell you?
- At lunch last Friday.

51:58.365 --> 52:01.951
I also know she meant nothing to Shelby.
I understand him better than you do.

52:02.036 --> 52:04.370
She was found in your
dressing gown and slippers.

52:04.455 --> 52:06.915
That's hardly the regulation costume
for an impersonal chat

52:06.999 --> 52:09.542
between a man and woman
who mean nothing to each other.

52:09.835 --> 52:12.835
Did you know or did you suspect he was
going to bring her here Friday night?

52:12.880 --> 52:15.548
How could I? I don't know that he
brought her here. Neither do you.

52:15.674 --> 52:18.134
- You merely assume it.
- What other assumption is possible?

52:18.219 --> 52:21.554
Do you love Carpenter so much you'd risk
your own safety to protect him?

52:21.639 --> 52:24.474
My own safety?
Do you suspect me?

52:24.642 --> 52:27.894
I suspect nobody and everybody.
I'm merely trying to get at the truth.

52:28.103 --> 52:30.313
I see you have been trying
to get at the truth.

52:30.397 --> 52:33.191
You've read things I never meant
anyone else to look at.

52:33.651 --> 52:35.109
Strictly routine.

52:35.236 --> 52:36.986
I'm sorry. Really.

52:40.616 --> 52:43.243
I'd better be going. I'll see you
in the morning, Miss Hunt.

52:43.536 --> 52:46.829
I must ask you not to leave
the house or use the phone.

52:47.164 --> 52:50.250
But... But I've got
to let my friends know I'm alive.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.127
Sorry, Miss Hunt,
but I must insist you do as I say.

52:53.254 --> 52:55.547
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

52:56.257 --> 52:59.842
But if anything should happen
to you this time, I wouldn't like it.

53:01.262 --> 53:02.929
All right. I promise.

53:03.055 --> 53:06.015
There's one more thing.
You may as well know what I know,

53:06.100 --> 53:07.725
some of it, at any rate.

53:07.810 --> 53:10.353
It'll save time and a lot
of unnecessary fencing.

53:11.564 --> 53:14.274
I know that you went away
to make up your mind

53:17.194 --> 53:20.697
whether you'd marry
Shelby Carpenter or not.

53:22.032 --> 53:24.742
What did you decide?
I want the truth.

53:26.912 --> 53:28.580
I decided not to marry him.

53:30.332 --> 53:32.500
I'll see you in the morning.
Good night.

53:32.751 --> 53:34.210
Good night.

53:48.851 --> 53:51.978
Really?
Does McPherson know that?

53:52.313 --> 53:55.023
Well, okay. Good-bye.

53:56.442 --> 53:58.943
Say, Mark, that was
the medical examiner's report.

53:59.069 --> 54:02.405
It wasn't Laura Hunt. It was Diane
Redfern that was bumped off upstairs.

54:02.573 --> 54:05.241
- Kinda balls things up, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

54:05.326 --> 54:07.368
Say, you're not taking it too hard.

54:07.453 --> 54:09.829
Wait a minute.

54:10.164 --> 54:12.582
- Hello?
- This is Laura. I've...

54:12.666 --> 54:14.500
Don't say anything on the phone.
Meet me right away.

54:14.627 --> 54:16.628
I'll wait for you in my car
in front of Bullitt's.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.505
- Was that...
- Yeah.

54:19.965 --> 54:21.758
Dames are always
pulling a switch on you.

54:22.301 --> 54:23.635
Stand by.

54:41.695 --> 54:43.571
You follow her.
I'm gonna tail him.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.292
Are you taking it down
or putting it away, Carpenter?

55:51.849 --> 55:54.600
- It's been fired lately.
- Yes. I killed some rabbits with it.

55:54.768 --> 55:57.520
- When?
- A while back. I don't know exactly.

55:57.604 --> 55:59.355
You know about guns, don't you?

55:59.440 --> 56:02.275
- Yes.
- How come you didn't clean it afterward?

56:02.359 --> 56:05.111
I don't know.
I forgot, I suppose.

56:05.362 --> 56:08.698
- Your initials?
- Yes. I gave it to Laura for protection.

56:08.991 --> 56:11.033
She didn't want it,
but I insisted.

56:11.452 --> 56:13.911
This house is rather isolated,
as you see.

56:14.079 --> 56:16.539
- Did you teach her how to use it?
- No.

56:16.790 --> 56:20.293
- Does she know how?
- I don't know. It didn't occur to me to ask.

56:20.502 --> 56:22.670
You're a vague sort of a fellow,
aren't you, Carpenter?

56:22.796 --> 56:26.257
I've spent very little time in observing
my own character, Mr. McPherson.

56:26.341 --> 56:29.102
You haven't borrowed it lately?
You didn't just bring it back tonight?

56:29.136 --> 56:32.180
You followed me here.
You saw me come in. You ought to know.

56:33.056 --> 56:35.975
You realize
the spot you're in, Carpenter?

56:36.977 --> 56:38.978
You took that poor girl
to Miss Hunt's apartment.

56:39.062 --> 56:41.439
You knew all along
it was she who was murdered.

56:43.317 --> 56:46.694
Didn't you know Laura Hunt would come
back any day and spill the whole thing?

56:48.655 --> 56:50.364
Or did you plan
to kill her too,

56:50.449 --> 56:53.493
hide the body someplace
and cover up your first crime?

56:53.577 --> 56:55.369
You're being fantastic,
McPherson.

56:57.164 --> 56:59.665
You took a bottle of Black Pony
to her house Friday night.

57:00.042 --> 57:01.959
I took it there
over a week ago.

57:02.169 --> 57:05.254
Bessie said it wasn't there Friday
night. It was Saturday morning.

57:05.339 --> 57:06.923
I can't help what Bessie said.

57:10.177 --> 57:13.137
- Where's the key to her apartment?
- I haven't got it.

57:13.222 --> 57:15.681
What did you do with it,
give it back to her tonight?

57:16.934 --> 57:17.934
I never had one.

57:18.227 --> 57:20.895
You didn't take the bottle
of scotch to her house Friday night.

57:20.979 --> 57:23.105
You haven't got a key to her apartment.
How did you get in?

57:23.190 --> 57:24.910
- Well, I...
- You had a key, and I know it.

57:24.942 --> 57:27.360
- Now, come on, Carpenter. Spill it.
- I...

57:28.987 --> 57:32.073
Laura kept a duplicate key
at her office. I went over and got it.

57:32.533 --> 57:36.327
I'd asked Diane to dine with me. I wanted
to have it out with her once and for all.

57:36.578 --> 57:40.540
You know, she thought... Well,
she thought she was in love with me.

57:41.041 --> 57:44.293
Well, we couldn't go on talking
in public places. She was too upset.

57:44.461 --> 57:47.182
I couldn't go to her room, and I didn't
want to take her to my hotel.

57:47.256 --> 57:49.298
- So we went to Laura's.
- Yeah?

57:49.591 --> 57:51.592
We talked there
for about three hours,

57:52.094 --> 57:54.929
- and then the doorbell rang and...
- Go on.

57:55.389 --> 57:58.099
Diane was frightened.
But knowing Laura as I've known her,

57:58.183 --> 58:00.142
I've learned to be
surprised at nothing.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.644
What do you mean by that?

58:01.728 --> 58:03.396
Her friends would come to her
with their troubles

58:03.522 --> 58:05.731
at all hours
of the day or night.

58:05.816 --> 58:08.234
I asked Diane
to answer the door.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.569
Why didn't you go yourself?

58:09.653 --> 58:12.280
Supposing one of Laura's friends
had found me there.

58:12.364 --> 58:15.199
- Why open the door at all?
- They must have seen the light.

58:15.325 --> 58:18.035
What about the girl? Diane,
what about her reputation?

58:18.120 --> 58:21.664
I asked her to tell them Laura had let
her the apartment while she was away.

58:21.832 --> 58:24.083
Anybody that knew Laura
would have believed that.

58:24.293 --> 58:27.128
- Yeah. Go on.
- Well, then the doorbell rang again.

58:27.713 --> 58:30.506
I could hear Diane's mules,
Laura's they were

58:30.591 --> 58:33.593
clattering across the bare boards
between the rugs.

58:33.677 --> 58:36.178
Then there was a moment's silence
and then a shot.

58:37.264 --> 58:39.056
It was an awful explosion.

58:40.183 --> 58:42.768
By the time I reached her,
the door was closed.

58:43.270 --> 58:45.897
- She lay there on the floor.
- Did you go out to see who it was?

58:45.981 --> 58:49.734
No. I was too confused, too horrified,
incapable of doing anything.

58:49.943 --> 58:53.154
The room was dark. I saw only
a vague heap lying on the floor.

58:54.031 --> 58:57.074
I don't think
I fully grasped the situation.

58:57.200 --> 59:00.328
I think I called her name,
but I'm not sure. I...

59:00.454 --> 59:03.623
I remember kneeling on the floor,
feeling her heart.

59:05.250 --> 59:07.043
My first instinct
was to call the police.

59:07.127 --> 59:09.128
- Why didn't you?
- I don't know.

59:09.212 --> 59:12.423
Or rather, I was afraid,
not only for myself, but for Laura.

59:12.633 --> 59:17.094
In a panicky sort of way, I felt I must
keep out of this to keep Laura out of it.

59:17.179 --> 59:19.347
I know now how foolish
and hopeless it was,

59:19.431 --> 59:22.016
but there was only
one thing on my mind,

59:22.100 --> 59:24.685
the safety of a person whose life
was dearer to me than my own.

59:24.770 --> 59:26.479
Don't you understand that?

59:26.688 --> 59:28.189
Did you think
Laura had done it?

59:29.066 --> 59:32.026
- Did you?
- I don't remember what I thought.

59:32.444 --> 59:34.779
- Do you think so now?
- No.

59:35.280 --> 59:37.156
- But you didn't?
- No.

59:37.491 --> 59:40.785
On Saturday, when our men went to the
hotel to tell you that Laura was dead,

59:40.869 --> 59:44.789
- you seemed sincerely shocked.
- I was. I hadn't expected that mistake.

59:44.873 --> 59:46.958
But you had your alibi ready
no matter who was dead.

59:47.125 --> 59:49.669
Yet you knew the minute
Laura got back it wouldn't stick.

59:49.920 --> 59:52.588
Don't you see? I was incapable
of thinking that far ahead.

59:52.673 --> 59:55.216
I was incapable
of thinking at all.

59:55.300 --> 59:58.761
I was groping for some way
to keep Laura's name out of it.

59:58.845 --> 01:00:03.015
I was heartbroken about Diane
and panic-stricken about Laura.

01:00:03.558 --> 01:00:06.018
I haven't slept a full two hours
since this thing happened.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:09.271
Let's get back to the present. What did
you and Laura talk about tonight?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.941
I told her the whole story,
just as I've told you.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.987
She phoned you after she promised me
she wouldn't call anybody.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:17.154
What did she want?

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:19.281
It's perfectly natural
she should want to see me

01:00:19.366 --> 01:00:21.200
especially
after what's happened.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:23.828
Why don't you tell the truth? She sent
you here to get rid of this gun.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:27.248
She did not. It was my own idea.
She doesn't even know I'm here.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:36.882
- It works fine, doesn't it?
- Yes. Did you think it wouldn't?

01:00:38.385 --> 01:00:40.928
I hoped it wouldn't.
All right. Let's go.

01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:46.434
- Well, am I under arrest?
- No, but you're not to leave town

01:00:46.518 --> 01:00:48.119
and it would be
foolish of you to try it.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.082
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:14.962
- What's that?
- Breakfast.

01:01:15.130 --> 01:01:17.423
You didn't buy any food
when you went out last night.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:27.308
I'll fix some bacon and eggs.
Can you make coffee?

01:01:27.601 --> 01:01:30.102
Suppose you set the table
while I get breakfast.

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:33.606
Do you always sound like this
in the morning?

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.441
Don't tell me you can cook.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:39.779
My mother always listened
sympathetically to my dreams of a career

01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:41.572
and then taught me
another recipe.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.992
Don't move.

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:53.209
It's all right, Bessie.
It's all right, Bessie.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:55.544
She's alive.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.797
It's all been
a mistake, Bessie.

01:01:57.923 --> 01:01:59.131
I'm not a ghost. Really.

01:02:00.926 --> 01:02:03.469
I found you, and you were dead.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.138
It was Miss Redfern's
body you found.

01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.559
How about taking over here,

01:02:10.644 --> 01:02:12.561
fixing us some coffee and eggs.

01:02:12.979 --> 01:02:17.024
But I saw it with my own eyes.

01:02:18.485 --> 01:02:19.860
I don't understand it.

01:02:19.945 --> 01:02:22.154
Have you ever
heard a ghost ask for eggs?

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:24.782
No, miss.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:26.325
You'll be all right, Bessie.

01:02:37.129 --> 01:02:40.005
Somebody should have warned her.
Poor Bessie.

01:02:40.340 --> 01:02:43.342
By the way, I've asked Waldo Lydecker
to come here this morning.

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.386
- Did you tell him?
- No.

01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.680
Why not? It's brutal.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.473
I'm not doing it for fun.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:54.520
Why did you break your promise
and go out and see Shelby last night?

01:02:54.855 --> 01:02:56.730
You forced me
to give you my word.

01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:59.692
I never have been and I
never will be bound by anything

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:01.694
I don't do of my own free will.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.946
Redfern was in love
with Carpenter.

01:03:04.990 --> 01:03:06.699
You admitted that last night.

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:09.451
- May I have a match, please?
- I'm sorry.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.371
I also told you that
he wasn't in love with her.

01:03:13.582 --> 01:03:15.791
Just sit still.

01:03:23.550 --> 01:03:24.842
Hello, Lieutenant.

01:03:26.344 --> 01:03:28.637
- Morning, my darling.
- Hello, dear.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:32.558
Thank you.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:34.018
It's on again.

01:03:34.102 --> 01:03:36.142
Do I have to get a permit
from the police department

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:37.897
to kiss my fiancée good morning?

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.690
So he made you
change your mind.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:42.484
Speaking of changing one's mind,
Mr. McPherson,

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.361
I have just come
from my lawyer.

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.281
Yeah? Did he tell you how much
you'll get off for good behavior?

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:49.783
No, but he told me that anything
I may have said last night

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:52.828
was said under duress
and can't be used against me.

01:03:52.913 --> 01:03:54.538
Besides, none of it was true.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.832
Smart lawyer you've got.

01:03:56.917 --> 01:03:58.876
Maybe he told you how that scotch
got up here Friday night

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.628
after you'd bought it
at Mosconi's.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:02.796
Maybe it was the lawyer
who brought Diane Redfern up here.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.673
Maybe...

01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:12.139
Well, McPherson,

01:04:12.265 --> 01:04:14.266
have you thought over
the deal I suggested?

01:04:18.396 --> 01:04:21.023
Waldo.

01:04:21.233 --> 01:04:22.775
Waldo.

01:04:26.821 --> 01:04:28.989
Right-hand pocket.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:30.783
You want a doctor?

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.952
Right-hand pocket.

01:04:33.703 --> 01:04:35.287
We'd better take him
into the bedroom.

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.020
- What...
- Don't try and say anything, dear.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.470
Just be quiet.

01:04:54.683 --> 01:04:56.934
I think this is
carrying things too far.

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.270
Your methods are vicious.
There ought to be a law against it.

01:04:59.354 --> 01:05:01.647
- Yeah?
- How does he feel now?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:04.108
It was a terrible shock.
Poor darling.

01:05:04.192 --> 01:05:05.734
Don't tell me you're in love
with him too.

01:05:05.819 --> 01:05:08.320
Look here, fella. You're not to talk
that way to Miss Hunt.

01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:10.489
Shut up. Why do you cover up
for a guy like him?

01:05:10.657 --> 01:05:13.033
- Don't answer him, Laura.
- What story did he tell you last night?

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:14.878
Don't answer him. Let him
talk to our lawyer.

01:05:14.911 --> 01:05:15.911
Our lawyer?

01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:17.997
- So now you're covering up for each other.
- Look at him, Laura.

01:05:18.081 --> 01:05:20.916
He's beginning to crack up.
He'd use anything to make an arrest

01:05:21.001 --> 01:05:22.802
just so he can be a big shot
in the headlines.

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.962
I've got enough on you
to arrest you right now.

01:05:25.046 --> 01:05:27.047
Quick, McPherson,
the handcuffs.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:29.591
- Trundle him off to the hoosegow.
- You keep out of this.

01:05:29.676 --> 01:05:30.926
You'll look nice in bracelets.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:33.053
Why don't you get down
on all fours again, Waldo?

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:35.556
It's the only time you've ever
kept your mouth shut.

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:38.517
I hope you'll forgive
my wee touch of epilepsy, my dear.

01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.394
It's an old family custom.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:44.356
Well, McPherson, what does
Laura's resurrection do to you?

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:46.942
Too bad Diane Redfern
can't be resurrected.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.862
I'm afraid I've interrupted
what you call "a pinch."

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:52.031
Do your duty, McPherson.

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:55.909
You know, Lydecker,
you've made me change my mind.

01:05:56.411 --> 01:05:58.454
- For the moment.
- Well, in that case,

01:05:58.538 --> 01:06:00.581
we'll have time
for a little get-together.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.042
You'd better order some liquor
and some food, Laura.

01:06:03.168 --> 01:06:04.877
What for?

01:06:04.961 --> 01:06:06.641
People are coming
to celebrate your return.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.881
Ann and Bullitt and Corey.
Everybody.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:12.009
- Who asked them to come?
- I did, when I was in there.

01:06:12.552 --> 01:06:14.345
I phoned my man,
and he's calling everyone.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:18.390
- Why did you do that, Waldo?
- A sense of the fitness of things, my dear.

01:06:18.558 --> 01:06:22.144
Perhaps our friend can weave all the
loose ends into a noose. McPherson?

01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:24.628
Sorry you went to all that trouble.
I've already called them.

01:06:29.402 --> 01:06:31.403
You're working yourself
to death, darling.

01:06:31.529 --> 01:06:34.907
- I haven't had a moment with you all day.
- It's a very thirsty crowd.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:37.242
After all,
it isn't your homecoming.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:39.828
Aren't you being
a little bit nasty, Ann?

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.997
I feel nasty
when I don't see you.

01:06:42.123 --> 01:06:45.667
Well, you look very sweet. That's
a completely wonderful hat, darling.

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:48.462
Now, if you'll forgive me,
Laura wants a cocktail.

01:06:48.880 --> 01:06:51.256
- So do I.
- Well, here you go.

01:06:52.550 --> 01:06:54.760
Shelby, why don't you
come to your senses?

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:58.305
You know it's all over between you
and Laura, or it soon will be.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:02.059
But you haven't lost me.
Why don't we get married now?

01:07:02.143 --> 01:07:03.519
Ann, dear, you don't seem
to realize the situation.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:04.853
Yes, but I do.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:08.315
That's why you need me. We'll get
the best lawyer that money can buy.

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.776
When it's all over, we'll go away,
anywhere you want,

01:07:10.944 --> 01:07:11.984
and forget about all this.

01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:15.155
Thanks, Ann, but you see,
Laura needs me. Sorry.

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.123
- Laura.
- Thanks.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.459
If you don't mind,
I'd like a word with Miss Hunt.

01:07:27.627 --> 01:07:30.254
I don't mind.
Talk to her as much as you like.

01:07:31.548 --> 01:07:34.800
- I see he's taking a new tack.
- What do you mean?

01:07:34.968 --> 01:07:37.803
Trying to make you like him
to make you talk.

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.473
Shelby, tell me,
why did you go to...

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:44.560
Excuse me.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.148
Why did you go
to the cottage last night?

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.567
But don't you know?
I was afraid

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:53.318
you wouldn't think
of hiding that shotgun.

01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:56.572
- What shotgun?
- The one I gave you.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.992
You don't have to lie
to me, darling.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.702
I'll stand by you.

01:08:09.544 --> 01:08:11.003
What's the matter, Laura?

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:14.339
I guess I'm just nervous.
That's all.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:16.841
So am I.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.345
McPherson suspects Shelby.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.390
He seems to suspect me too.

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:26.435
And so do some of my friends.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:29.020
You? Don't be absurd.

01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:31.857
- You could never do a thing like that.
- And Shelby?

01:08:31.983 --> 01:08:33.649
I don't think he did it.

01:08:33.776 --> 01:08:35.109
But he's capable of it.

01:08:37.697 --> 01:08:39.865
Are you as interested in McPherson
as he is in you?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.075
But, Ann, I only
met him last night.

01:08:42.785 --> 01:08:44.495
That's more than
long enough sometimes.

01:08:44.953 --> 01:08:47.788
Anyway, he's better for you
than Shelby. Anybody is.

01:08:49.751 --> 01:08:52.336
- Shelby's better for me.
- Why?

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:56.215
Because I can afford him,
and I understand him.

01:08:57.216 --> 01:08:59.218
He's no good,
but he's what I want.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.638
I'm not a nice person,
Laura. Neither is he.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:06.390
He knows I know he's
just what he is.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:08.769
He also knows
that I don't care.

01:09:10.104 --> 01:09:13.232
We belong together because we're
both weak and can't seem to help it.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.734
That's why I know
he's capable of murder.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:19.404
He's like me.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:23.575
No, dear, I didn't

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.827
but I thought of it.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.182
Hello? Yes. Yes.

01:09:47.725 --> 01:09:49.309
It's for you, Lieutenant.

01:09:50.728 --> 01:09:52.312
Thank you, Bessie.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:54.523
McPherson.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.819
Yeah, I know. Don't worry.

01:09:58.945 --> 01:10:01.071
I told you I'd bring in
the killer today.

01:10:02.782 --> 01:10:04.992
Yeah. I was just gonna
make the arrest when you called.

01:10:06.327 --> 01:10:08.704
No, I can't tell you now.
I'm not alone.

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.291
You'll see when I come in.

01:10:13.167 --> 01:10:14.751
Right. See you later.

01:10:35.189 --> 01:10:36.440
All right. Let's go.

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:38.567
- You mean...
- Yeah.

01:10:38.735 --> 01:10:40.402
Oh, no!

01:10:42.363 --> 01:10:44.740
No. No, no.

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:46.658
Not Miss Hunt.

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:48.660
Please!

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.747
Thank you, Bessie.

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:55.417
Thank you.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:59.254
Now will you please be good enough
to go and get me my things?

01:11:00.173 --> 01:11:02.174
- Yes, miss.
- Laura.

01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.511
Don't worry, darling.
Let them accuse you.

01:11:07.013 --> 01:11:08.555
We'll fight them.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:12.809
I have every weapon,
money, connections, prestige.

01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.353
And my column.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:17.773
Every day, millions will read about you
and rally to your defense.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:20.567
You talk as if you wanted
to see her tried for murder.

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:25.822
Yes. Rather than let you blacken
her name with suspicions and rumors.

01:11:26.491 --> 01:11:28.283
Try to prove her guilty.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:31.119
Get on the witness stand
with your poor shreds of evidence.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:34.373
I'll expose your cheap methods
you used on her.

01:11:35.958 --> 01:11:38.919
- Thank you, Bessie.
- Laura, I told you to watch out for this fella.

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:41.213
- Can we go now?
- I warned you.

01:11:43.508 --> 01:11:46.551
It's too bad you didn't
open that door Friday night, Carpenter.

01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:49.346
- Wait a minute.
- Shelby!

01:11:52.308 --> 01:11:53.975
Did he hurt you, darling?

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.561
Darling.

01:11:58.106 --> 01:11:59.606
Ann.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.362
Come in.

01:12:06.614 --> 01:12:08.198
Sit down.

01:12:09.701 --> 01:12:11.576
- That'll be all, Gallagher.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:19.418
All right. Let's have it.
Look at me.

01:12:21.754 --> 01:12:24.172
What are you trying to do,
force a confession out of me?

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.800
You've been holding out,
and I want to know why.

01:12:26.884 --> 01:12:28.719
It'll be easier for you
if you tell the truth.

01:12:30.388 --> 01:12:32.806
What difference
does it make what I say?

01:12:32.890 --> 01:12:35.058
You've made up your mind
I'm guilty.

01:12:35.143 --> 01:12:38.937
- Are you?
- Don't tell me you have any doubts.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:41.690
Since you... Oh, I can't.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.942
Please. Do I have to have
those lights in my face?

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:54.369
Thanks. No, I didn't
kill Diane Redfern

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:56.288
or anyone else.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.375
Then why...

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:03.712
Why did you tell me the radio
at your country place was broken?

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.047
- Because it was broken.
- Not when I tried it.

01:13:06.132 --> 01:13:08.972
Just as I was leaving the village,
I asked the local handyman to fix it.

01:13:09.051 --> 01:13:10.510
How did he get in?

01:13:10.595 --> 01:13:13.013
I always leave a key under the flowerpot
on the porch.

01:13:13.639 --> 01:13:18.226
You're too intelligent to make up
something I could check so easily

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:23.148
but you're intelligent enough to have broken
it yourself to strengthen your story.

01:13:23.274 --> 01:13:24.232
The main thing I want to know is

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:27.027
why you pulled that switch on me
about Carpenter.

01:13:27.153 --> 01:13:30.697
You told me last night
you decided not to marry him.

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:35.118
- Yes, I guess I did.
- But today it was on again. Why?

01:13:35.203 --> 01:13:39.456
Well, I changed my mind.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:44.002
What are you trying to hide? Don't you
realize you're involved in a murder?

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.963
You've got yourself in a jam it's not
going to be easy to get out of,

01:13:47.048 --> 01:13:49.090
unless you're on the level
with me.

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:51.676
This is no time for secrets.

01:13:51.761 --> 01:13:53.887
Now, did you really decide
to call it off

01:13:53.971 --> 01:13:57.557
or did you just tell me that because
you knew I wanted to hear it?

01:14:02.021 --> 01:14:05.148
What went on between you and Carpenter
when you saw him last night?

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.359
Did he persuade you to make up?

01:14:08.986 --> 01:14:11.196
Or did you agree
to pretend you had?

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:14.491
- Was that it?
- Well, we... That is, both of us thought...

01:14:14.575 --> 01:14:17.369
He convinced you that if you
broke the engagement now,

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.996
people would think
you believed he was guilty.

01:14:20.081 --> 01:14:23.583
Yes, but now I know it was only
because he thought I was.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:26.795
- Did you believe he was guilty?
- No. I'm sure he isn't.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:29.798
But he'd gotten himself
into an awfully suspicious position

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:33.134
and he's the sort of man that people are
always ready to believe the worst about.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:36.721
Are you in love with him?

01:14:41.227 --> 01:14:43.061
I don't see how
I ever could have been.

01:14:47.775 --> 01:14:49.526
Come on. You're going home.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:54.906
- But I thought I was...
- That's what I wanted you to think.

01:14:55.825 --> 01:14:59.035
You and a few others.
I didn't even book you.

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:01.329
You mean this was
some sort of a game?

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:04.332
I was 99% certain about you

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.751
but I had to get rid of
that one percent doubt.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:09.921
Wasn't there
an easier way to make sure?

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:13.425
I'd reached a point
where I needed official surroundings.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.596
Then it was worth it, Mark.

01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:22.517
I'll call a cab for you.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.325
Good night.
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:15:38.409 --> 01:15:39.618
Good night, Mark.

01:15:41.621 --> 01:15:43.622
I'm going over
to Lydecker's apartment.

01:17:06.747 --> 01:17:08.790
It still doesn't
make sense to me, Laura.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.084
He's playing some sort
of a game with you.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.587
- I don't think so.
- I don't deny that he's infatuated with you

01:17:14.672 --> 01:17:17.340
in some warped way of his own.

01:17:17.967 --> 01:17:21.553
But he isn't capable of any normal,
warm human relationship.

01:17:22.054 --> 01:17:25.015
He's been dealing
with criminals too long.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.477
When you were unattainable,
when he thought you were dead,

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:31.354
that's when he wanted you most.

01:17:31.439 --> 01:17:33.440
But he was glad
when I came back

01:17:33.524 --> 01:17:35.525
as if he were waiting for me.

01:17:35.693 --> 01:17:38.903
Do you know what
he calls women? "Dames."

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:42.407
A "dame" in Washington Heights
got a fox fur out of him.

01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:45.785
- His very words.
- That doesn't mean anything.

01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:47.746
He isn't like that.

01:17:48.539 --> 01:17:50.415
Laura, you have
one tragic weakness.

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:54.502
With you, a lean, strong body
is the measure of a man

01:17:54.587 --> 01:17:56.171
and you always get hurt.

01:17:58.215 --> 01:18:00.133
No man is ever
going to hurt me again.

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:03.011
No one, not even you.

01:18:03.971 --> 01:18:06.848
I? Hurt you?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:09.392
Laura, look at me.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:15.023
When a man has everything
in the world that he wants,

01:18:15.107 --> 01:18:18.276
except what he wants most,

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.403
he loses his self-respect.

01:18:20.780 --> 01:18:22.614
It makes him bitter, Laura.

01:18:23.783 --> 01:18:26.534
He wants to hurt someone
as he's been hurt.

01:18:28.662 --> 01:18:32.040
You were a long time
in finding out about Shelby,

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:35.085
but that's over now.

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:38.213
We'll be back together again.

01:18:40.174 --> 01:18:43.551
Haven't you heard of science's
newest triumph, the doorbell?

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:46.721
I don't like to remind her.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:53.770
- That was the murderer's signal.
- Did you eavesdrop too? I hope.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:57.315
I thought you'd like to know. We
tested your shotgun. It isn't the one.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.360
Now, that's what I call
a typical move,

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.946
a real key
to the man's character.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:05.865
First he tells you that
he thinks you're innocent,

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:08.034
then proceeds
to check up on you.

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:10.161
When I report that I think
she's innocent,

01:19:10.287 --> 01:19:12.455
that's my own personal opinion.

01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:15.125
When I submit proof, it becomes
the opinion of the department.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:18.002
This entire maneuver could be a trick
to get you off your guard.

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:19.754
It could be, but it isn't.

01:19:19.839 --> 01:19:23.591
- I believe you, Mark.
- It's the same obvious pattern, Laura.

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:27.679
If McPherson weren't muscular and
handsome in a cheap sort of way,

01:19:27.805 --> 01:19:29.597
you'd see through him
in a second.

01:19:29.849 --> 01:19:33.101
Waldo, I mean to be
as kind about this as I know how

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:37.939
but I must tell you, you're the one who
follows the same obvious pattern.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:39.941
First it was Jacoby, then Shelby.
And now I suppose...

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.192
- Laura, I...
- I don't think

01:19:41.277 --> 01:19:42.652
we should see each other again.

01:19:42.736 --> 01:19:46.781
- You're not yourself, darling.
- Yes, I am.

01:19:46.866 --> 01:19:49.868
For the first time in ages,
I know what I'm doing.

01:19:52.663 --> 01:19:54.914
Very well.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.584
I hope you'll never regret
what promises to be

01:19:57.668 --> 01:20:00.044
a disgustingly
earthy relationship.

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.840
My congratulations, McPherson.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.385
Listen to my broadcast
in 15 minutes.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:10.722
I'm discussing
great lovers of history.

01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:34.996
It was the most difficult thing
I ever had to do in my whole life.

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.166
All I need is the gun.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.297
What are you doing?

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:46.341
Do you know the combination
to this thing?

01:20:47.259 --> 01:20:50.970
- I never knew it had one.
- It must be somewhere.

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:05.610
- Have you ever seen this before?
- No.

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:08.446
Waldo gave you that clock,
didn't he?

01:21:10.032 --> 01:21:11.532
Yes.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:15.161
The doorbell rang

01:21:15.371 --> 01:21:18.206
and Diane Redfern
went to the door in your negligee.

01:21:19.792 --> 01:21:23.127
She opened the door.
The room was dark.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:27.757
Waldo saw a girl standing there,
and he assumed it was you.

01:21:28.968 --> 01:21:31.052
He figured that if
he couldn't have you himself,

01:21:31.136 --> 01:21:32.971
he was gonna make sure
that nobody else did.

01:21:33.097 --> 01:21:35.139
So he let her have it

01:21:38.727 --> 01:21:40.812
with both barrels,
right in the face.

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.816
She fell here.

01:21:45.985 --> 01:21:48.278
Waldo heard Shelby running
from the next room

01:21:48.821 --> 01:21:51.197
so he hid
in the stairway outside.

01:21:53.284 --> 01:21:56.077
Shelby was scared,
so he ran out as fast as he could.

01:21:56.203 --> 01:21:58.997
Then Waldo came back
and placed the gun in that clock.

01:22:01.542 --> 01:22:03.626
I knew it.

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:06.170
I've felt it
ever since I came back

01:22:06.255 --> 01:22:08.673
but I didn't want
to believe it.

01:22:08.966 --> 01:22:11.676
I couldn't make myself
believe that

01:22:11.844 --> 01:22:14.012
Waldo was a murderer.

01:22:14.638 --> 01:22:18.349
- Well, he is.
- He didn't really kill Diane Redfern.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:20.768
- I killed her.
- What are you talking about?

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:25.690
But I did, Mark. I did as surely
as if I'd pulled the trigger myself.

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:27.525
That's nonsense. Forget it.

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:31.612
No, Mark, I can't.
I'm as guilty as he is,

01:22:31.739 --> 01:22:35.700
not for anything I did,
but for what I didn't do.

01:22:37.411 --> 01:22:41.456
But I couldn't help myself.
I owed him too much.

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:48.963
I can understand that, Laura,

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:50.965
but I can't understand why
you've tried so hard

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:52.717
to protect Shelby these last few days.

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:55.053
I was nearly frantic for fear
you'd arrest Shelby.

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:58.264
I knew he wasn't guilty.
He hasn't enough courage to kill a fly.

01:22:58.390 --> 01:23:01.392
And Waldo was doing everything
he could to incriminate him.

01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.603
It was his way
of getting rid of Shelby,

01:23:03.729 --> 01:23:05.271
just as he did Jacoby.

01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:10.902
I must say, for a charming,
intelligent girl,

01:23:10.986 --> 01:23:14.280
you've certainly surrounded yourself
with a remarkable collection of dopes.

01:23:16.033 --> 01:23:18.826
Don't touch anything.
Fingerprints will be important.

01:23:21.121 --> 01:23:22.789
I'll have the clock
picked up tomorrow.

01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:25.291
- What are you going to do?
- Arrest Waldo.

01:23:25.417 --> 01:23:28.086
- Mark.
- Can't be helped.

01:23:34.468 --> 01:23:36.761
That's to make sure
you're not disturbed.

01:23:37.262 --> 01:23:39.013
If the doorbell rings,
don't answer it.

01:23:39.723 --> 01:23:42.308
- I'll phone you in the morning.
- Good night, Mark.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:46.813
Get some sleep. Forget
the whole thing like a bad dream.

01:25:39.218 --> 01:25:42.887
And thus,
as history has proved, love is eternal.

01:25:44.014 --> 01:25:47.308
It has been the strongest motivation
for human actions

01:25:47.392 --> 01:25:49.185
throughout centuries.

01:25:49.561 --> 01:25:51.395
Love is stronger than life.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:54.857
It reaches beyond
the dark shadow of death.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.402
I close this evening's
broadcast

01:25:58.529 --> 01:26:01.489
with some favorite lines
from Dowson.

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.699
Brief Life.

01:26:05.327 --> 01:26:09.372
"They are not long,
the weeping and the laughter,"

01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.583
"love and desire and hate."

01:26:13.835 --> 01:26:16.045
"I think they have
no portion in us"

01:26:16.380 --> 01:26:18.256
"after we pass the gate."

01:26:19.424 --> 01:26:22.718
- Who's tailing Lydecker?
- I was going to, when he came out.

01:26:22.886 --> 01:26:25.763
- He left five minutes ago.
- He didn't come out this way.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:28.266
Must've gone out the back way.
Come on. Let's check.

01:26:29.685 --> 01:26:33.854
"They are
not long, the days of wine and roses."

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:38.985
"Out of a misty dream,
our path emerges for a while,"

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:41.028
"then closes within a dream."

01:26:43.323 --> 01:26:45.825
- That's the way it is, isn't it, Laura?
- Waldo!

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.369
You have
heard the voice of Waldo Lydecker

01:26:48.453 --> 01:26:49.996
by electrical transcription.

01:26:50.581 --> 01:26:54.458
Waldo, you've taken one life.
Isn't that enough?

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:58.296
The best part of myself,
that's what you are.

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:02.174
Do you think I'm going to leave it
to the vulgar pawing

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:05.428
of a second-rate detective
who thinks you're a dame?

01:27:05.512 --> 01:27:08.264
Do you think I could bear the thought
of him holding you in his arms,

01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:10.891
kissing you, loving you?

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.312
Laura! It's Mark.
Open the door!

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:16.147
- There he is now.
- Laura!

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.442
He'll find us together, Laura,

01:27:19.901 --> 01:27:23.154
as we always have been, as we always
should be, as we always will be.

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.164
Mark!

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:45.676
Good-bye, Laura.

01:27:55.395 --> 01:27:58.189
Good-bye, my love.
