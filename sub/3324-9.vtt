00:02.003 --> 00:03.288
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.504 --> 00:06.337
- When's the Kanima not the Kanima?
- When it's Jackson.

00:06.549 --> 00:07.789
Someone's controlling him.

00:07.967 --> 00:09.707
Something that affects the Konimo...

00:09.886 --> 00:12.298
- affects its master.
- Meaning we can catch them.

00:12.472 --> 00:14.428
- You're supposed to trust me.
- I trust you.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.547
- Scott!
- Just stay out of the way!

00:22.106 --> 00:24.643
I had a plan, you know.
That would be you.

00:24.817 --> 00:29.777
You wouldn't die, but you would
be able to do one very important thing.

00:51.427 --> 00:52.667
Lydia.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.584
Lydia! Lydia!

02:20.933 --> 02:22.218
Leave me alone.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.558
Unfortunately, I ca n't.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.106
At least not yet.

02:31.986 --> 02:33.601
Are you real?

02:39.201 --> 02:40.816
Interestingly,

02:41.746 --> 02:44.579
that question can also be
answered, "Not yet."

02:46.709 --> 02:49.246
I promise everything's going to
get back to normal, Lydia.

02:50.463 --> 02:51.953
All that you have to do...

02:55.009 --> 02:58.547
is every single thing that | ask.

03:01.140 --> 03:03.301
Timing is key here, Lydia.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.676
It all needs to happen
by the next full moon.

03:07.355 --> 03:09.562
Do you know what they call
the full moon in March?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.889
It's called the Worm Moon.

03:15.029 --> 03:19.022
They call it that because
it's the last full moon of winter,

03:19.617 --> 03:23.860
and the worms would literally
crawl out of the earth as it thawed.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.163
Kind of has the feel of a rebirth,
doesn't it?

03:34.382 --> 03:36.293
But the full moon is on Wednesday.

03:36.676 --> 03:38.382
That's my birthday.

03:38.969 --> 03:39.924
Exactly.

03:41.347 --> 03:44.430
And Lydia's birthday is always
the party of the year, isn't it?

03:45.559 --> 03:47.595
Everyone wants to go to Lydia's party.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.390
So we're going to make it
a very special party.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.107
And what if I don't?

03:57.321 --> 04:00.188
I think it's best if we
just make a plan and stick to it.

04:01.117 --> 04:02.653
That way no one gets hurt.

04:04.787 --> 04:05.947
Why me?

04:06.163 --> 04:08.620
Because Lydia Martin
is not only beautiful,

04:08.916 --> 04:10.622
not only incredibly intelligent,

04:11.168 --> 04:12.874
she's immune.

04:13.838 --> 04:14.918
Immune to what?

04:15.131 --> 04:17.964
That's right.
They haven't told you, have they?

04:18.759 --> 04:21.296
Bet you've felt like
the last to know for a long time.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.423
Doesn't feel good, does it?

04:23.639 --> 04:25.630
You deserve to know everything.

04:25.850 --> 04:28.091
It's probably best if I just show you.

05:26.744 --> 05:29.030
It's not that deep, okay?

05:33.083 --> 05:34.209
It's all right.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.999
I'll clean it myself.

05:40.424 --> 05:42.005
It's not that bad.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.879
We don't know. We can't know.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.174
Not for sure.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.923
It's a bite from an Alpha.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.713
She's my wife.

05:50.100 --> 05:51.135
Allison's mother.

05:51.310 --> 05:56.100
And I'm the cold-hearted patriarch
holding his family to its commitments.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.934
We all have our roles.

05:58.526 --> 06:03.065
Just don't expect me to play
poisoned king to your Hamlet of a son.

06:03.948 --> 06:05.313
Not with a full moon coming.

06:05.533 --> 06:07.148
What about Allison?

06:07.409 --> 06:09.400
How am I supposed to
get her through this?

06:09.620 --> 06:10.780
We just buried Kate.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.453
Then tell me,
how long is long enough?

06:14.208 --> 06:15.744
When exactly do you think

06:15.960 --> 06:18.201
Allison will be emotionally
prepared enough

06:18.379 --> 06:20.165
to handle the death of her mother?

06:23.634 --> 06:25.590
She can't lose her too.

06:25.845 --> 06:28.052
You're getting your tenses mixed up.

06:28.681 --> 06:30.342
Your wife is already dead.

06:31.809 --> 06:35.848
That thing over there is
just a cocoon waiting to hatch.

06:40.568 --> 06:42.729
I'm saying we need a new plan,

06:42.945 --> 06:46.062
because next time, one of us
is gonna be too hurt to heal.

06:47.116 --> 06:48.526
I get it.

06:48.951 --> 06:50.907
We can't save Jackson.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.992
We can't seem to kill him either.

06:53.205 --> 06:54.786
I've seen a lot of things, Scott.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.905
I've never seen anything like this.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.416
Every new moon's just gonna make
him stronger.

06:59.712 --> 07:01.577
Then how do we stop him?

07:02.047 --> 07:03.332
I don't know.

07:03.549 --> 07:04.664
I don't even know if we can.

07:04.884 --> 07:06.624
Yeah, maybe we should just
let the Argents handle it.

07:06.844 --> 07:10.257
I'm the one who turned him.
It's my fault.

07:10.472 --> 07:13.009
Yeah, but you didn't turn him into this.

07:13.225 --> 07:15.841
I mean, this happened because of
something in his past, right?

07:16.061 --> 07:18.552
That's a legend in a book.
It's not that simple.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.808
What do you mean?
What are you not telling me?

07:20.816 --> 07:22.852
Why do you think I'm always
keeping something from you?

07:23.068 --> 07:25.400
Because you always are
keeping something from me.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.478
Well, maybe I do it to protect you.

07:28.324 --> 07:31.737
Doesn't being part of your pack
mean no more secrets?

07:33.537 --> 07:36.279
Go home, Scott. Sleep. Heal.

07:36.749 --> 07:38.205
Make sure your friends are safe.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.408
'Cause the full moon's coming.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.827
And with the way things are going,

07:43.047 --> 07:46.039
I've got a feeling
it's gonna be a rough one.

07:54.224 --> 07:58.968
So, about that
incredibly bad idea I had...

07:59.188 --> 08:00.519
You mean the kiss?

08:00.731 --> 08:03.222
- Yeah, that's the one.
- Don't worry about it.

08:03.692 --> 08:04.647
For real?

08:04.944 --> 08:06.184
Definitely.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.736
So, what's going on with you and Scott?
Are you guys...

08:13.953 --> 08:15.784
Are you guys still together, or what?

08:18.874 --> 08:20.080
Not really.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.914
"Not really."

08:22.419 --> 08:23.534
God, I hate not reallys.

08:23.754 --> 08:25.915
You never know what to do
with "not really."

08:26.882 --> 08:29.874
Would you understand if I said
it was complicated?

08:30.844 --> 08:32.095
Not really.

08:35.975 --> 08:37.090
But I'll try.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.453
Open the window.

09:48.589 --> 09:49.954
Forgot my bag.

09:50.215 --> 09:51.921
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.129
Some good pictures in there,
don't you think?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.723
Yeah, the lacrosse ones are amazing.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.721
You're really talented. I was...

10:03.937 --> 10:05.518
l was really impressed.

10:09.026 --> 10:12.143
There was a good candid
of you in there too.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.815
Really?

10:15.032 --> 10:16.442
You can see some of
the others if you'd like.

10:16.658 --> 10:17.864
I mean, this...

10:18.077 --> 10:19.738
This tiny little screen
doesn't really do it justice,

10:19.953 --> 10:22.820
but I could show you some
on my computer.

10:23.957 --> 10:27.666
Oh, I would totally like that,
but maybe another night.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.911
Well, just for a few minutes.

10:31.507 --> 10:32.792
It's getting kind of late.

10:33.592 --> 10:34.752
It's the weekend.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.754
I know, but, you know, I...

10:36.970 --> 10:38.130
And it's spring break.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.339
I mean, you don't have a thing
going on tomorrow.

10:42.684 --> 10:43.890
Do you?

10:45.479 --> 10:47.310
I should really get going.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.685
You sure?

10:52.111 --> 10:53.226
I'm sure.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.026
Okay.

11:18.971 --> 11:19.960
What is that?

11:20.639 --> 11:21.924
It's a triskele.

11:23.767 --> 11:27.225
Spirals mean different things,
past, present, future.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.643
Mother, father, child.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.312
You know what it means to me?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.188
Alpha, Beta, Omega?

11:33.652 --> 11:34.687
That's right.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.943
It's a spiral.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.654
Reminds us that we can all rise
to one or fall to another.

11:39.867 --> 11:41.073
Betas can become Alphas,

11:41.285 --> 11:43.901
but Alphas can also fall to
Betas or even Omegas.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.486
Like Scott?

11:46.248 --> 11:48.455
- Scott's with us.
- Really?

11:49.251 --> 11:50.991
Then where is he now?

11:51.378 --> 11:52.663
He's looking for Jackson.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.620
Don't worry, he's not gonna have
it easy tonight either.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.205
None of us will.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.837
There's a price you pay
for this kind of power.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.718
You get the ability to heal.

12:01.930 --> 12:04.012
But tonight you're gonna want to
kill anything you can find.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.385
Good thing I had
my period last week, then.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.272
Well, this one's for you.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.692
Clear your schedule.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.520
This could take a while.

12:24.620 --> 12:26.576
How many outfits do you plan
on wearing tonight?

12:26.914 --> 12:28.575
It's my birthday party.

12:28.790 --> 12:32.374
I'm thinking host dress,
evening dress, then...

12:32.920 --> 12:34.126
after-hours casual.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.625
I noticed that you
didn't send out any invites.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.086
Biggest party of the year, Allison.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.542
Everyone knows.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.885
l was wondering if maybe...

12:44.765 --> 12:47.381
this year things, you know,
might be different.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.094
Why would anything be different?

12:49.436 --> 12:50.972
Just 'cause things have been off lately.

12:51.438 --> 12:52.848
Things and people.

12:53.232 --> 12:54.688
Like Jackson.

12:57.653 --> 12:59.189
What do you care about Jackson?

13:03.158 --> 13:05.274
Do you know if he's coming tonight?

13:06.787 --> 13:08.152
Everyone's coming.

13:11.375 --> 13:12.535
This one's American Rag.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.747
Mmm, I love it.
For me, not you.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.124
This one's Material Girl.

13:18.924 --> 13:20.039
That's for you.

13:21.176 --> 13:22.165
Ms. Argent.

13:22.678 --> 13:24.464
- What do you think of this one?
- It's lovely.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.054
Allison, can I grab you
for a moment to talk?

13:28.642 --> 13:31.725
- Just the two of us.
- Um, can we do it later?

13:31.979 --> 13:36.097
Actually, to be honest,
sooner would be better.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.518
Party's at 10:00.

13:37.776 --> 13:40.062
You'll be around before then?

13:40.862 --> 13:42.693
- I think so.
- You think so.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.233
I don't know.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.441
You think so?

13:47.661 --> 13:49.572
Well, it does have black on it, but...

13:52.332 --> 13:54.493
- No, it's too much.
- I think I like this.

13:55.043 --> 13:57.034
I like that.
Yeah, no, I do.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.793
Happy birthday.

13:59.006 --> 14:00.086
Thank you.

14:00.424 --> 14:01.960
I actually appreciate that.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.132
Hey, what you doing?

14:09.016 --> 14:10.096
Homework.

14:14.438 --> 14:16.099
It's spring break.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.515
What do you think you're doing?

14:19.735 --> 14:21.851
Just satisfying my own curiosity.

14:24.948 --> 14:27.735
We brought Harris in
this morning for questioning.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.282
They brought him in.

14:29.536 --> 14:30.366
And?

14:30.579 --> 14:32.740
And they're working on a warrant
to arrest him for the murders.

14:32.956 --> 14:33.945
For all of them?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.281
- Enough of them.
- With what proof?

14:36.501 --> 14:38.162
You remember the couple
at the trailer?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.835
The tire tracks nearby
match Harris's car.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.629
That's not enough.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.879
The same car was also seen
outside the hospital

14:47.095 --> 14:49.006
where the pregnant wife was killed.

14:49.222 --> 14:52.635
It's got some bumper sticker on it,
a quote from Einstein.

14:52.893 --> 14:53.882
Wait, what quote?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.593
Something about imagination
and knowledge.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.892
"Imagination is more important
than knowledge." Yeah.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.815
I saw the same car
parked outside the rave.

15:03.028 --> 15:05.485
That means you're a witness.
You're gonna have to give a statement.

15:05.697 --> 15:08.814
But what about the concert promoter, Kara?
She wasn't in Harris's class, right?

15:09.034 --> 15:10.695
I mean, what does Mr. Lahey
have to do with Harris?

15:10.911 --> 15:12.321
It doesn't matter.

15:12.537 --> 15:16.029
The tire tracks put Harris
at the site of three murders.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.580
That's damning evidence.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.999
No, it's not enough.

15:19.211 --> 15:20.701
I thought you hated this guy.

15:20.921 --> 15:22.786
I don't hate him, all right?
He hates me.

15:23.006 --> 15:24.507
And, you know,
if he killed them all,

15:24.716 --> 15:26.331
then yeah,
lock the psycho up.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.167
But there's something missing.
There's gotta be something missing.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.174
Hey. Hey!

15:33.600 --> 15:35.636
You don't have to solve this for me.

15:36.937 --> 15:38.768
No, I have to do something.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.852
Look at the swim team.

15:53.829 --> 15:55.740
Dad, the coach.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.374
It's Isaac's dad.

16:07.676 --> 16:08.631
Jackson.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.335
You're coming to my party, right?

16:25.110 --> 16:27.146
You don't want me there.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.397
Trust me.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.608
Don't worry about it.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.903
I'm over it.
Look, of course I want you...

16:35.745 --> 16:37.997
You do not want me there.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.967
I'll see you there.

17:15.952 --> 17:17.283
For Lydia.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.376
Whoo, party!

17:40.060 --> 17:41.596
Happy birthday!

17:42.187 --> 17:43.142
Yeah!

17:43.480 --> 17:44.845
Coming in.

17:45.482 --> 17:46.597
Oh, whoa.

17:46.816 --> 17:47.976
Hang on.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.979
Okay.

17:51.363 --> 17:54.196
You know, you don't...
Can you just grab that side, maybe?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.782
Don't forget to try the punch.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.619
- Have you seen Jackson anywhere?
- No. Seen Allison?

18:05.835 --> 18:08.121
No, but we should probably
tell her what we found.

18:08.338 --> 18:09.874
I'm still kind of
not sure what we found.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.876
We figured out it has
something to do with water.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.083
You know, the fact that all the
victims were on the swim team,

18:14.302 --> 18:16.384
the way the Kanima reacted
around the pool.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.882
So whoever's controlling the Kanima
really hates the swim team?

18:19.099 --> 18:21.966
Hated the swim team.
Specifically, the 2006 swim team.

18:22.185 --> 18:24.562
So it could be another teacher.
Maybe, like, a student back then.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.932
I mean, who are we missing?
What haven't we thought of?

18:28.608 --> 18:30.348
Uh, Jackson's not here.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.066
Yeah, no one's here.

18:33.363 --> 18:35.274
- Maybe it's just early.
- Or maybe nobody's coming

18:35.490 --> 18:38.197
because Lydia's turned into
the town wackjob.

18:39.703 --> 18:42.490
Well, we have to do something, because we've
completely ignored her for the past two weeks.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.747
She's completely ignored Stiles
the past ten years.

18:45.959 --> 18:49.451
I prefer to think of it as
me not having been on her radar yet.

18:50.046 --> 18:51.161
We don't owe her a party.

18:51.381 --> 18:52.962
- What about the chance to get
back to normal? - Normal?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.756
She wouldn't be the town
wack job if it wasn't for us.

18:58.555 --> 19:01.547
I guess I could use my co-captain status
to get the lacrosse team here.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.927
Yeah, I also know some people
who can get this thing going.

19:04.144 --> 19:04.974
Like, really going.

19:05.186 --> 19:06.562
- Who?
- I met them the other night.

19:06.771 --> 19:09.228
Let's just say they know how to party.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.738
And you are?

19:19.951 --> 19:21.907
We're here for the party.

19:26.958 --> 19:28.494
Well, come on in.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.121
Nice!

19:31.671 --> 19:32.956
Come on, man!

19:34.758 --> 19:36.339
Don't touch anything.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.085
Hey, what if we break free?

19:40.305 --> 19:41.795
Then you'll do anything you can
to get out of here.

19:42.057 --> 19:43.137
Probably try to kill me,

19:43.350 --> 19:45.466
then kill each other and kill
anything else with a heartbeat.

19:45.977 --> 19:47.513
I need you to hold her.

19:48.146 --> 19:50.262
So how come she gets to wear
the headband thing?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.768
Because she'll be able to withstand
more pain than the two of you.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.355
I've got an extra one
if you really want it.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.606
I'll pass.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.448
You ready?

19:59.699 --> 20:00.939
Yeah.

20:37.195 --> 20:40.107
Are you gonna apologize to
Allison or what?

20:40.323 --> 20:43.986
- Why should I apologize?
- Because you're the guy. It's what we do.

20:44.285 --> 20:47.152
- But I didn't do anything wrong.
- Then you should definitely apologize.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.408
See, any time a guy thinks he
hasn't done anything wrong,

20:49.624 --> 20:51.740
it means he's definitely done
something wrong.

20:52.460 --> 20:53.666
I'm not apologizing.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.001
Is that the full moon talking, buddy?

20:56.214 --> 20:59.206
Probably.
Why do you care, anyway?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.378
Because, Scott,
something's gotta go right here.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.836
I mean, we're getting our asses
royally kicked, if you haven't noticed.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.842
People are dying.
I got my dad fired.

21:07.058 --> 21:08.594
You're gonna be held back in school.

21:08.810 --> 21:09.970
I'm in love with a nut job.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.098
And if on top of all that, I gotta watch
you lose Allison to a stalker like Matt,

21:13.314 --> 21:15.646
I'm gonna stab myself in the face.

21:15.859 --> 21:18.396
- Don't stab yourself in the face.
- Why not?

21:18.611 --> 21:19.817
Because Jackson's here.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.698
Glad you could make it.

22:10.121 --> 22:11.406
How do you not feel this?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.079
I feel every second of it.

22:14.375 --> 22:15.581
Then how do you control it?

22:15.794 --> 22:17.159
Find an anchor.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.334
Something meaningful to you.
Bind yourself to it.

22:19.547 --> 22:20.798
Keeps the human side in control.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.087
What is it for you?

22:23.676 --> 22:26.668
Anger. But it doesn't have to be
that for everybody.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.253
You mean Scott?

22:29.224 --> 22:30.339
Yeah.

22:32.060 --> 22:33.470
All right, that should do it.

22:45.490 --> 22:48.448
You really thought I would
do this using prescription pills.

22:48.660 --> 22:51.697
According to gender statistics,
most women...

22:55.416 --> 22:57.031
But you're not most women.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.451
I'll go upstairs and write the letter.

23:08.847 --> 23:11.213
Don't hesitate because of Allison.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.094
She'll feel the ground
shifting beneath her feet

23:14.310 --> 23:16.096
time and again in her life.

23:16.354 --> 23:19.642
It is our job to teach her
how to keep standing.

23:20.024 --> 23:21.980
The ground isn't shifting.

23:22.443 --> 23:24.434
- It's crumbling.
- You want easy?

23:24.654 --> 23:26.064
Change your last name.

23:27.323 --> 23:32.818
Otherwise, go up there and
help your wife die with dignity.

23:33.872 --> 23:36.238
Because if she doesn't fall
on her own sword,

23:36.457 --> 23:39.199
one of us is gonna have to
run her through.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.883
Uh, I can't drink tonight.

24:31.095 --> 24:33.051
All right, what is with the two of you?

24:33.556 --> 24:35.012
Oh, no, Stiles is drinking.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.634
Not Stiles.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.136
You and Allison.

24:38.353 --> 24:40.765
I don't care why you have to
keep your little love affair so secret,

24:40.939 --> 24:45.933
but right here and right now
seems like the perfect time just...

24:47.320 --> 24:48.901
...to have a good time.

24:50.281 --> 24:51.782
You know something?

24:53.284 --> 24:54.820
You're right.

25:02.377 --> 25:03.332
See?

25:03.962 --> 25:05.202
Isn't it good?

25:08.591 --> 25:09.831
Really good.

25:23.690 --> 25:25.396
You get two minutes.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.103
Okay, right.

25:33.491 --> 25:37.655
So, I know I took some pictures
of you that I should've told you about.

25:37.954 --> 25:40.115
But is it really that bad that...

25:41.749 --> 25:43.785
That I think you're beautiful...

25:44.252 --> 25:47.210
And I think you should be the
subject of a perfect photograph?

25:47.422 --> 25:50.789
Um, Matt, some of those pictures,

25:51.009 --> 25:53.125
I don't even know how you took them.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.126
Telephoto lens.
I mean, come on, Allison.

25:55.346 --> 25:57.052
Photographers call them candids.

25:57.432 --> 25:59.844
Well, police officers call it stalking.

26:04.188 --> 26:07.021
Stalking.
So I'm a stalker now.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.222
Is that it?

26:08.401 --> 26:11.188
You think my bedroom is
wall-papered with your photos.

26:11.404 --> 26:13.315
You think I'm the kind of guy
that's gonna say something like,

26:13.489 --> 26:15.741
"Well, if I can't have her, no one can"?

26:15.950 --> 26:18.532
Well, you know what? Get over yourself,
because there's another pretty girl

26:18.745 --> 26:20.952
walking through the room
every five minutes.

26:25.668 --> 26:28.159
Well, then, all you have to do
is wait another three.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.998
- Good luck.
- Allison, wait.

26:34.802 --> 26:38.169
- What is the matter with you?
- I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.266
No. No, not here.

26:49.317 --> 26:50.557
Scott!

26:51.277 --> 26:52.437
Scott!

27:05.792 --> 27:07.498
Look at you.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.166
Yelling for help.

27:09.712 --> 27:12.124
Always yelling for help.

27:13.007 --> 27:14.747
It's pathetic, Allison.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.129
You. You have no idea

27:18.346 --> 27:21.133
how much I've been
looking forward to this.

27:42.453 --> 27:43.693
You feeling okay?

27:45.206 --> 27:46.946
It's not the moon. It's different.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.407
Why am I wearing black?
What are you, an idiot?

27:49.627 --> 27:53.040
I just came from a funeral.
You know, people wear black of funerals.

27:53.256 --> 27:56.293
- Dude, chill. It was just...
- Chill... Get out of my face!

28:03.015 --> 28:04.300
It's you.

28:04.934 --> 28:06.549
It's all you.

28:08.271 --> 28:09.977
You know, every day I saw her

28:10.189 --> 28:12.726
lying in that hospital slowly dying...

28:14.485 --> 28:19.024
I thought, "How the hell am I supposed
to raise this stupid kid on my own?

28:19.740 --> 28:23.699
"This hyperactive little bastard
who keeps ruining my life?"

28:28.624 --> 28:29.830
It's all you.

28:30.459 --> 28:32.711
It's you, Stiles.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.500
You killed your mother.
You hear me?

28:38.718 --> 28:40.128
You killed her.

28:42.013 --> 28:44.004
And now you're killing me.

29:05.077 --> 29:07.614
I didn't get a chance to talk to her.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.369
So I want to do it here,

29:12.960 --> 29:14.916
where I can be with her.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.878
But I think I'm gonna need your help.

30:21.237 --> 30:22.352
Lydia.

30:34.125 --> 30:35.661
His name is Jackson.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.162
- We're looking for Jackson Whittemore.
- Has anyone seen Jackson?

30:39.213 --> 30:41.670
- We're his parents.
- Mr. Whittemore?

30:41.882 --> 30:43.713
No, we're his real parents.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.459
No, no.

30:46.679 --> 30:49.842
- Could someone tell him we're here?
- Tell him we're his real parents.

31:18.419 --> 31:20.284
You guys seen Lydia?
You know where Lydia is?

31:20.504 --> 31:22.244
Have you seen Lydia? Lydia?

31:22.590 --> 31:23.955
Where's Lydia?

31:46.614 --> 31:49.856
Scott, can you call me back?
I'm probably gonna need some help.

31:52.703 --> 31:54.534
Definitely gonna need some help.

32:16.727 --> 32:17.762
Isaac!

32:28.280 --> 32:30.316
Stiles, look at me.
Drink the water.

32:30.533 --> 32:33.240
Stiles, drink it. Something's happening,
and I need you to sober up right now.

32:33.411 --> 32:35.072
- Come on, Stiles.
- What do you think you're doing?

32:35.287 --> 32:37.118
You want to sober him up fast,
that's not the way to do it.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.868
- You can do better?
- I can do best, boy.

32:45.339 --> 32:47.000
How do you feel?

32:47.216 --> 32:50.333
Like I might have to revisit
my policy on hitting a girl.

32:50.553 --> 32:52.043
He's sober.

33:38.017 --> 33:39.052
Wait.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.887
I can feel it.

33:41.103 --> 33:42.604
It's happening.

33:43.772 --> 33:45.353
You know what to do.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.979
You know what to tell people.
Tell them I had a history of depression.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.026
- Promise me.
- I will.

33:52.323 --> 33:55.315
I will, even though I've never
seen you depressed once in 20 years.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.525
Allison needs to say it too.

33:58.954 --> 34:00.990
But I won't let her believe it.

34:02.750 --> 34:04.365
She'll hear things.

34:05.920 --> 34:07.876
People will say I was weak.

34:10.257 --> 34:13.090
They'll say I took the easy way out.

34:13.511 --> 34:16.344
Well, I'll tell her it was
the hardest thing you ever did.

34:17.097 --> 34:20.931
And they'll ask, how could I
do this to my family?

34:25.105 --> 34:27.357
She'll know you did it for us.

34:45.543 --> 34:47.283
I can't do this myself.

34:48.337 --> 34:49.326
Chris.

34:50.256 --> 34:51.541
Help me.

35:08.482 --> 35:09.597
Now.

35:29.169 --> 35:30.909
Think you'll be okay now.

35:32.506 --> 35:34.007
Looks like you found an anchor.

35:35.301 --> 35:36.586
My father.

35:40.097 --> 35:42.930
Your father locked you in a freezer
in the basement to punish you.

35:45.352 --> 35:46.603
He didn't use to.

36:41.325 --> 36:42.815
No.

36:43.118 --> 36:44.324
Babe...

36:44.536 --> 36:45.491
No.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.080
No,Dad.No,Dad!

36:47.581 --> 36:51.039
If this is some kind of sick
training session you had...

36:52.169 --> 36:54.706
You better tell me!
You better tell me!

36:55.172 --> 36:57.003
No. I'm sorry.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.336
I'm sorry.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.962
I hate...

37:03.305 --> 37:05.296
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:05.516 --> 37:06.676
You...

37:07.309 --> 37:08.264
I'm sorry.

37:08.477 --> 37:10.718
What happened? What...

37:11.730 --> 37:12.890
Sweetie...

37:16.026 --> 37:17.436
I'm sorry.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.234
I'm sorry.

37:29.707 --> 37:30.913
Hey, I can't find her.

37:31.125 --> 37:33.787
And, dude, anyone who drank that crap,
they're freaking out.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.579
I can see that.

37:39.133 --> 37:40.998
- What the hell do we do?
- I don't know, but we gotta...

37:41.218 --> 37:42.628
I can't swim!

37:43.137 --> 37:46.004
No, no, no, stop!
I can't swim! I can't... Stop!

37:47.975 --> 37:49.090
I can't...

37:53.522 --> 37:54.807
I can't...

38:15.711 --> 38:17.292
What are you looking at?

38:30.017 --> 38:32.099
- The cops are here.
- Party's over!

Lydia.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.308
Lydia.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.450
Lydia, stop.

39:47.386 --> 39:49.342
You don't know what you're doing.

40:56.204 --> 40:58.456
I heard there was a party.

41:06.840 --> 41:08.546
But don't worry.

41:09.217 --> 41:11.082
I invited myself.
