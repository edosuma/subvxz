<i>My name is Michael Westen.</i>
<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.462 --> 00:06.963
We got a burn notice
on you. You're blacklisted.

00:07.031 --> 00:09.399
<i>When you're burned,</i>
<i>you've got nothing --</i>

00:09.467 --> 00:11.905
<i>no cash, no credit,</i>
<i>no job history.</i>

00:11.973 --> 00:14.327
<i>You're stuck in whatever city</i>
<i>they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.395 --> 00:16.318
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.386 --> 00:19.514
<i>You do whatever work</i>
<i>comes your way.</i>

00:19.582 --> 00:22.113
<i>You rely on anyone</i>
<i>who's still talking to you.</i>

00:22.181 --> 00:23.717
<i>A trigger-happy</i>
<i>ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:23.785 --> 00:25.320
Should we shoot them?

00:25.387 --> 00:27.890
<i>...An old friend who used</i>
<i>to inform on you to the FBI...</i>

00:27.960 --> 00:30.300
You know spies --
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.368 --> 00:32.700
<i>...Family, too...</i>
<i>Hey, is that your mom again?</i>

00:32.768 --> 00:34.935
<i>...If you're desperate.</i>
<i>Someone needs your help, Michael.</i>

00:35.004 --> 00:37.440
<i>Bottom line --</i>
<i>as long as you're burned,</i>

00:37.508 --> 00:39.041
<i>you're not going anywhere.</i>

00:44.504 --> 00:46.370
Max! What happened?

00:46.438 --> 00:47.704
Who did this to you?

00:47.772 --> 00:49.404
Say goodbye for me.
Max!

00:51.074 --> 00:52.874
Whoever did this
managed to put

00:52.942 --> 00:55.008
a murder weapon in Michael's
hands and get away clean.

00:55.076 --> 00:57.476
The only thing that's gonna save
me is finding the real killer.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.244
Now, we know
you built the bomb, Lucien,

01:02.312 --> 01:04.513
but you're not the guy
we're after.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.214
Either you tell us
how to find the guy

01:06.282 --> 01:07.750
who killed Max, or --

01:07.818 --> 01:08.786
Mike, get down!

01:13.594 --> 01:15.162
Where, Lucien?!
Where is his place?

01:15.230 --> 01:17.698
Warehouse...
in Wynwood.

01:20.704 --> 01:22.672
He's gone, Mike.
And we lost our only lead.

01:22.739 --> 01:24.909
Not quite. Lucien told me
where to find him.

01:24.977 --> 01:27.645
Well, then, I think we owe
that son of a bitch a visit.

01:30.860 --> 01:33.162
<i>In any search-and-capture</i>
<i>operation,</i>

01:33.230 --> 01:36.299
<i>you have to balance speed</i>
<i>against planning.</i>

01:36.367 --> 01:37.934
<i>Once you locate your target,</i>

01:38.002 --> 01:39.569
<i>you have a hard choice</i>
<i>to make --</i>

01:39.637 --> 01:43.006
<i>take too much time planning,</i>
<i>and your target gets away.</i>

01:43.074 --> 01:46.477
<i>Take too little time planning,</i>
<i>and you get yourself killed.</i>

01:56.422 --> 01:58.390
He's in there.
We should go in now.

01:58.458 --> 02:01.259
I'm pretty sure we can bypass
the security system.

02:01.327 --> 02:02.761
The guy just tried
to mow us down

02:02.829 --> 02:04.496
with a high-caliber
machine gun, Mike.

02:04.564 --> 02:06.499
"I'm pretty sure" isn't what
I want to hear right now.

02:07.434 --> 02:09.701
He thinks we're dead, Sam.
He won't be expecting us.

02:09.769 --> 02:11.703
Oh, well, then it'll be
a walk in the park.

02:11.771 --> 02:13.104
Look,
I'm just saying, Mike,

02:13.172 --> 02:15.206
the guy killed an experienced
CIA field officer

02:15.274 --> 02:16.740
and framed you for it.

02:16.808 --> 02:19.009
Guy's gonna be a handful whether
he sees us coming or not.

02:19.077 --> 02:21.511
If we call for reinforcements,
we might tip him off.

02:21.579 --> 02:22.812
We can't risk that.

02:22.880 --> 02:25.282
Right. What kind of defenses
we talking about?

02:25.349 --> 02:27.818
Nothing we can't handle.

02:27.885 --> 02:30.120
Oh, great, so,
we're gonna snatch a murderer

02:30.188 --> 02:32.623
with some magnets
and a roll of duct tape?

02:32.691 --> 02:35.526
And guns, Sam.
Plenty of guns.

02:37.129 --> 02:40.731
<i>Most commercial security</i>
<i>systems use magnetic sensors.</i>

02:40.799 --> 02:42.833
<i>When a door opens,</i>
<i>it breaks an electrical circuit</i>

02:42.901 --> 02:44.869
<i>and triggers the alarm,</i>

02:44.936 --> 02:46.904
<i>which means defeating</i>
<i>the system is just a matter</i>

02:46.972 --> 02:49.507
<i>of keeping a magnet in contact</i>
<i>with the sensor.</i>

03:01.052 --> 03:03.753
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>very security-conscious people</i>

03:03.821 --> 03:07.557
<i>often customize systems</i>
<i>with less-visible sensors...</i>

03:07.625 --> 03:08.825
Mike.

03:08.892 --> 03:10.693
I think I stepped
on something.

03:10.761 --> 03:12.161
<i>...Like a pressure plate</i>
<i>in the floor</i>

03:12.229 --> 03:14.631
<i>that silently announces</i>
<i>your presence...</i>

03:14.699 --> 03:16.767
<i>...And gives whoever's inside</i>

03:16.834 --> 03:18.469
<i>a chance to do something</i>
<i>about it.</i>

03:26.745 --> 03:27.978
Mike, there's the guy!

04:07.185 --> 04:10.287
Mike, it's over.

04:10.355 --> 04:12.290
He's gone.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.654
So the guy who shot Max

04:20.680 --> 04:21.910
finally pokes his head out

04:21.922 --> 04:23.289
and no one thinks
to call me?

04:23.356 --> 04:25.557
I wanted to, believe
me. There just wasn't time.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.125
You keep me
on the sidelines again,

04:27.193 --> 04:29.528
you can bandage
your own burns.

04:29.595 --> 04:30.895
Focus, people.

04:30.963 --> 04:32.830
We got to find this guy,
and the only thing we got now

04:32.898 --> 04:33.931
is a thoroughly toasted
computer.

04:33.999 --> 04:35.266
It looks like
scrap metal.

04:35.334 --> 04:37.402
You really think you can get
something off there?

04:37.470 --> 04:38.970
We have to try.

04:39.038 --> 04:41.173
He wouldn't have destroyed it
if there wasn't something there.

04:41.241 --> 04:43.709
I know a guy who can help,
but it's gonna take some doing.

04:43.777 --> 04:45.344
We're not exactly
on speaking terms.

04:45.412 --> 04:47.013
Plus, I got this
corporate-security gig

04:47.080 --> 04:48.881
I told Jesse I would do.

04:48.949 --> 04:50.851
We got to make it fast, Sam.
I already talked to Pearce.

04:50.918 --> 04:52.219
She's investigating
the warehouse fire.

04:52.286 --> 04:54.388
That was like two hours ago.
How'd she even know?

04:54.456 --> 04:56.690
I'm not sure, but I'm supposed
to meet her there later.

04:56.758 --> 04:58.392
You think she suspects
you're involved?

04:58.459 --> 05:00.861
I don't know what she knows,
but it's probably a good idea

05:00.929 --> 05:03.131
for you two to steer clear of me
for a while.

05:03.198 --> 05:04.365
Okay, how about this?

05:04.433 --> 05:06.467
You fill in for me
on this job with Jesse,

05:06.535 --> 05:08.769
fi and I will handle
the barbecued hard drive.

05:08.837 --> 05:10.405
Until then,
we'll just go radio silent.

05:10.472 --> 05:12.106
No calls, no contact
till we know what's up.

05:12.174 --> 05:13.508
Sounds like a plan.

05:13.575 --> 05:14.509
Thanks.

05:28.057 --> 05:29.925
It's an HK91.

05:29.992 --> 05:32.226
The same make and model was used
in a murder in Hialeah

05:32.294 --> 05:33.695
the police discovered
this morning.

05:33.762 --> 05:36.998
And this is connected
to our investigation how?

05:37.066 --> 05:39.867
Murder victim was a Romanian
war criminal.

05:39.935 --> 05:44.072
Max had dealings in that area
in 2002, made some enemies.

05:44.140 --> 05:46.574
Not sure why they'd wait a
decade to come after him, but...

05:46.642 --> 05:48.309
at this point,
it's the best lead we've got.

05:48.377 --> 05:50.378
Sounds good.
How can I help?

05:50.446 --> 05:52.747
You can start by letting me have
your files on the investigation.

05:52.815 --> 05:54.382
I want to review everything

05:54.450 --> 05:56.451
for a connection
to the Romanians.

05:56.519 --> 05:58.487
Why don't you let me take another
look at the files? I could --

05:58.554 --> 06:01.456
No offense, but I need
my own eyes on this.

06:01.524 --> 06:03.892
I've got a feeling.

06:03.960 --> 06:05.260
I know I'm close.

06:06.229 --> 06:07.530
No problem.

06:07.597 --> 06:10.500
I could get you
all my files...friday.

06:10.567 --> 06:12.636
Make it tomorrow.

06:12.703 --> 06:13.837
Latest.

06:21.413 --> 06:23.111
Look, Mike, I appreciate
you filling in for Sam

06:23.136 --> 06:24.707
on this job. I really do.

06:24.716 --> 06:26.718
I just got to ask you,
are you sure this is a good time

06:26.785 --> 06:28.086
for you to be taking
freelance work?

06:28.153 --> 06:29.487
Well, the way I see it,

06:29.555 --> 06:31.256
Sam's got his hands full,
and you need the help.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.025
Yeah, and your CIA contact
is like this close

06:33.093 --> 06:34.526
to discovering
you've been lying to her.

06:34.594 --> 06:36.962
All the more reason for me
to stay busy and out of her way.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.031
Just tell me
what the job is.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.067
It's a -- it's a
corporate-security gig.

06:41.135 --> 06:43.770
Client's name is
Richard Gronbach -- billionaire.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.172
He owns fast-food joints
and big-box stores.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.676
Some industrial-espionage types
have been targeting him.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.177
- Do we know what they're after?
- No. No.

06:51.245 --> 06:52.846
That's what
we have to find out.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.814
I got in with them
posing as a middleman

06:54.882 --> 06:56.182
for stolen
financial data.

06:56.250 --> 06:58.250
The other day, they asked me
if I know a decryption guy

06:58.318 --> 06:59.485
who could do a quick job.

06:59.552 --> 07:01.887
Enter Michael Westen,
a.k.a. Matt Graham.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.722
They're meeting
at a private airport

07:03.789 --> 07:04.956
that Gronbach uses
up north.

07:05.023 --> 07:06.724
They want to hack
some airport computers.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.058
I think
I can handle that.

07:08.126 --> 07:09.927
There's one more little --
little thing.

07:09.994 --> 07:12.662
Uh, I needed someone to take
some surveillance photos

07:12.730 --> 07:13.964
in the parking lot.

07:14.031 --> 07:16.299
Only problem is, all my guys
look like FBI agents.

07:16.367 --> 07:18.601
So, I figured no one
would notice, like, a...

07:18.669 --> 07:21.771
you know,
like a 60ish-year-old woman

07:21.839 --> 07:23.741
sitting in a car.
- You called my mom.

07:23.809 --> 07:26.076
I'll call her and tell her
it's a no-go. It's -- I --

07:26.144 --> 07:27.478
just tell me it's safe.

07:27.545 --> 07:30.081
They're white-collar guys, Mike.
It's a cakewalk.

07:30.148 --> 07:31.749
It's just something to keep
your mind off things

07:31.817 --> 07:33.952
while Sam and Fi deal
with your CIA problem.

07:34.019 --> 07:36.388
I said I don't want
to talk to you. Go away!

07:36.455 --> 07:38.190
Dixon, I just need
a small favor, okay?

07:38.257 --> 07:39.424
Favors are for friends,

07:39.492 --> 07:41.126
and friends don't tase
one another

07:41.194 --> 07:42.962
and put them
in the trunks of cars!

07:44.598 --> 07:46.232
First of all,
that was years ago.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.533
Second,
I said I was sorry.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.035
And, you know, third,
if you'd agreed to help,

07:49.103 --> 07:50.237
I wouldn't have
had to do it.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.506
You never have to
tase anyone, ever!

07:52.574 --> 07:55.008
How can you sit there and t--
mnh! Leave me alone!

07:55.076 --> 07:57.043
Dixon, just hear me out.

07:57.111 --> 07:58.445
A quick trip to your lab,

07:58.513 --> 08:00.013
we take some stuff
off a computer,

08:00.081 --> 08:02.016
you never see me again.

08:02.083 --> 08:04.284
Oh, since you put it
that way -- no! Okay?

08:04.352 --> 08:06.620
Are you sure
that's your answer?

08:06.688 --> 08:07.955
Who are you?
How'd you get in here?

08:09.224 --> 08:10.858
You picked my door lock?!
Wh--

08:10.925 --> 08:12.393
Sam said you might
be reluctant to help.

08:12.460 --> 08:13.627
Sam! No!
Oh, Fi. Fi!

08:15.330 --> 08:17.465
Ohh...Fi.

08:17.533 --> 08:19.534
I was really hoping
that wouldn't be necessary.

08:19.601 --> 08:21.269
Ahh.

08:21.336 --> 08:22.837
So, uh,
where's his lab?

08:22.905 --> 08:24.005
Other side of town.

08:25.574 --> 08:27.908
Hopefully he wakes up
by the time we get there.

08:27.976 --> 08:28.943
All righty.

08:33.615 --> 08:35.349
So, what's
a corporate spy, anyway?

08:35.417 --> 08:37.585
Usually former
finance guys or consultants

08:37.653 --> 08:39.653
who finally figured out
they can make more money

08:39.721 --> 08:41.655
stealing corporate secrets
than keeping them.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.424
It's nothing too scary.
It's gonna be quick.

08:43.491 --> 08:46.895
Mike's gonna use the decryption
software on this laptop,

08:46.962 --> 08:48.596
go in there and do
his hacking thing for them.

08:48.664 --> 08:50.198
Maddy, you're gonna
document everything.

08:50.266 --> 08:54.235
Mike comes back, we debrief,
we are done by lunch.

08:54.303 --> 08:55.970
- Here we go. Right over here.
- Where?

08:56.038 --> 08:58.039
Black Benz.

08:58.106 --> 08:59.907
All right, you see that weasel
texting on his phone?

08:59.975 --> 09:01.909
That's Holcomb.

09:01.977 --> 09:03.411
He's the one running
this little project.

09:07.048 --> 09:08.448
Well, it's nice to be dealing

09:08.516 --> 09:10.416
with people
who carry Blackberrys

09:10.484 --> 09:12.118
instead of guns
for a change.

09:12.186 --> 09:14.320
All right. Maddy, you go get
set up in short-term parking.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.589
Mike, good luck.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.625
I'll be parked right down the
road if you guys need anything.

09:20.328 --> 09:24.964
<i>Businesses often use</i>
<i>independent contractors on jobs</i>

09:25.032 --> 09:28.101
<i>to contain costs</i>
<i>and limit liability.</i>

09:28.169 --> 09:30.537
<i>Criminals do the same thing</i>
<i>for similar reasons.</i>

09:30.605 --> 09:33.240
<i>Someone who just joined</i>
<i>the team</i>

09:33.307 --> 09:36.176
<i>won't expect an equal cut</i>
<i>of whatever you're stealing,</i>

09:36.244 --> 09:37.577
<i>and if they don't know</i>
<i>your plans,</i>

09:37.645 --> 09:39.480
<i>they can't go to the cops.</i>
- <i>Are you Graham?</i>

09:39.547 --> 09:40.881
That's me.

09:40.949 --> 09:42.483
I'm Holcomb.

09:42.550 --> 09:44.451
This is Ward.

09:44.519 --> 09:45.853
We'll be working together
today.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.087
Let's go.

09:47.155 --> 09:48.722
Wait. Slow down.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.658
You want to fill me in
on what we're doing?

09:50.725 --> 09:52.126
I can tell you
what we're <i>not</i> doing.

09:52.193 --> 09:53.794
We're not asking questions.

09:53.862 --> 09:55.763
I got to know what the job is.
I got to know --

09:55.830 --> 09:58.265
You're gonna push some buttons on
a computer when I tell you to.

10:03.037 --> 10:05.472
<i>There's nothing quite like</i>
<i>the feeling that you get</i>

10:05.540 --> 10:07.407
<i>in the pit of your stomach</i>
<i>when you begin to suspect</i>

10:07.475 --> 10:10.677
<i>your intelligence on an</i>
<i>operation may have been wrong.</i>

10:10.745 --> 10:12.679
<i>Once you're in, though,</i>
<i>there's not much you can do</i>

10:12.747 --> 10:14.180
<i>but keep your eyes open</i>

10:14.248 --> 10:17.283
<i>and figure out</i>
<i>just how bad the situation is.</i>

10:18.852 --> 10:21.487
Uh, guys, I thought
I was just pushing buttons.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.555
- What's with the hardware?
- Okay.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.490
Mr. Inquisitive.

10:25.558 --> 10:27.525
I'm only gonna
say this once.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.494
A billionaire
named Richard Gronbach

10:29.561 --> 10:31.162
is landing here
today at noon.

10:31.229 --> 10:33.731
By then, we are gonna have
this whole place locked down.

10:33.798 --> 10:36.500
We board his plane,
we use our, uh, "Hardware"

10:36.567 --> 10:38.535
to take care
of his security detail

10:38.603 --> 10:41.405
and to convince Mr. Gronbach
to give up his bank codes,

10:41.472 --> 10:42.706
and then you...

10:42.774 --> 10:44.207
You get to push
some buttons.

10:44.275 --> 10:45.742
Got it?

10:45.810 --> 10:47.945
Sounds good. I wish you
would've told me that earlier.

10:48.012 --> 10:49.279
I would've brought
my own piece.

10:49.347 --> 10:50.948
Why don't you give me
one of those bad boys?

10:51.016 --> 10:52.216
I'll make myself useful.

10:52.283 --> 10:55.619
Thanks.
But we got this.

10:59.090 --> 11:01.091
Everyone
to the center of the room!

11:01.159 --> 11:02.460
- Now!
- Get down!

11:05.130 --> 11:06.664
Down!

11:06.732 --> 11:08.933
Don't move!
Don't move!

11:11.036 --> 11:13.337
<i>There's a cold math</i>
<i>to hostage-taking.</i>

11:13.405 --> 11:16.239
<i>Once someone dies,</i>
<i>things get worse quickly.</i>

11:16.307 --> 11:18.008
<i>Because the penalty</i>
<i>for killing one hostage</i>

11:18.076 --> 11:19.610
<i>is pretty much the same</i>

11:19.678 --> 11:21.645
<i>as the penalty</i>
<i>for killing all of them...</i>

11:21.713 --> 11:24.648
<i>The key is keeping</i>
<i>that first person alive...</i>

11:26.217 --> 11:28.719
<i>...even if you have to bruise</i>
<i>a few ribs to do it.</i>

11:32.657 --> 11:34.490
Hey, old man.

11:34.558 --> 11:38.094
I know you think you're
supposed to be a hero here.

11:38.162 --> 11:39.996
But you're not ready for
this action. You understand?

11:40.064 --> 11:41.464
Y-y-yeah.
I understand.

11:41.532 --> 11:44.133
I was just explaining
to the rent-a-cop here

11:44.201 --> 11:45.268
the merits
of cooperating.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.005
I think I've earned
my keep.

11:49.073 --> 11:50.473
You'll earn your keep
with the computer.

11:52.476 --> 11:55.111
Now put him
with the others.

11:58.148 --> 12:00.516
Get inside!
Get inside! Sit down.

12:01.817 --> 12:02.817
All right, everyone!

12:02.885 --> 12:04.952
May I have your attention?

12:05.020 --> 12:07.254
We're not here to hurt you.

12:07.322 --> 12:09.423
In fact, you are gonna be

12:09.491 --> 12:12.860
our new partners
in a little business venture.

12:12.927 --> 12:15.963
Your job here today is easy --

12:16.031 --> 12:17.165
stay calm...

12:17.232 --> 12:19.801
And do as you're told.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.636
And in exchange
for a job well done,

12:21.704 --> 12:24.239
you will receive two things --

12:24.307 --> 12:27.476
a gift certificate
for a steak dinner...

12:27.544 --> 12:29.311
and your lives.

12:29.379 --> 12:31.046
Now, I-I know some of you

12:31.114 --> 12:33.115
must be concerned
that you've seen our faces.

12:33.183 --> 12:34.683
Don't be,
because in a few hours,

12:34.751 --> 12:36.818
my team and I are gonna be
sitting on a beach in a country

12:36.886 --> 12:39.921
that does not cooperate
with U.S. law enforcement.

12:39.989 --> 12:42.657
So, you see,
you have nothing to fear

12:42.725 --> 12:44.725
as long as things
go well today.

12:44.793 --> 12:47.194
But if things don't go well...

12:47.262 --> 12:49.696
if you resist...

12:49.764 --> 12:52.632
or try to call the police...

12:52.699 --> 12:55.235
then I'm gonna be forced
to use this.

12:56.770 --> 13:00.240
And kill
every single one of you.

13:03.077 --> 13:04.678
steak dinner...

13:04.745 --> 13:06.814
or a grenade.

13:06.881 --> 13:09.216
The choice is yours.

13:13.847 --> 13:15.053
Go.

13:15.652 --> 13:17.469
Up the stairs to the left,
ladies.

13:18.411 --> 13:20.512
Go.

13:20.580 --> 13:24.515
Everybody
in the conference room.

13:24.583 --> 13:26.650
Hey, at the risk
of asking a question,

13:26.718 --> 13:28.385
who you got taking roll call
on the hostages?

13:28.453 --> 13:31.421
Roll call?
How do you mean?

13:31.488 --> 13:32.956
Come on. You're a pro.

13:33.023 --> 13:35.091
you do a head count...

13:35.159 --> 13:36.960
check it against
the employee records,

13:37.027 --> 13:38.328
make sure
everybody's here.

13:38.396 --> 13:40.663
This isn't homeroom, Graham.
Don't worry.

13:40.731 --> 13:42.598
We've got everybody.

13:42.666 --> 13:44.434
You know how I ended up
in the joint?

13:44.501 --> 13:47.404
1997, my crew was doing
a bank job up in Boston.

13:47.472 --> 13:49.039
We didn't notice
that there was

13:49.107 --> 13:50.841
an extra security guard
on duty.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.876
He hid in the can
and called the cops.

13:52.944 --> 13:54.578
Feel free to check
all the stalls

13:54.646 --> 13:56.046
next time
you go take a leak.

13:56.114 --> 13:57.548
You already missed
one guard.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.017
You don't want to see that
happen again, do you?

14:00.085 --> 14:01.886
Look, I'll pull
the personnel files

14:01.954 --> 14:03.121
from the airport's
computer.

14:03.189 --> 14:04.623
I'll cross-check it
against the hostages.

14:04.690 --> 14:06.458
Consider it insurance.

14:08.862 --> 14:10.896
Fine.
Knock yourself out.

14:10.964 --> 14:14.033
You won't regret it,
boss man.

14:14.100 --> 14:16.669
Next. Come on.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.437
<i>The ironic thing</i>
<i>about infiltrating</i>

14:18.505 --> 14:20.139
<i>a group of criminals</i>

14:20.207 --> 14:21.874
<i>is that the only way</i>
<i>to successfully be accepted...</i>

14:21.942 --> 14:23.242
Next.

14:23.310 --> 14:24.643
<i>...Is to actually</i>
<i>be helpful.</i>

14:24.711 --> 14:26.278
Stan Werner.
Have a seat.

14:26.346 --> 14:27.913
Next. Next.

14:27.981 --> 14:29.214
<i>If you're useless or lazy,</i>

14:29.282 --> 14:31.049
<i>you'll probably wind up</i>
<i>getting shot.</i>

14:31.117 --> 14:32.751
Good. Sit down. Next.

14:32.819 --> 14:35.253
J-j-Judy --
j-Judy -- Judy --

14:35.321 --> 14:36.988
Come on. Spit your name out.
Come on!

14:37.056 --> 14:38.623
Judy Epplebee.

14:40.559 --> 14:42.126
Okay. Thanks.
<i>You have to be</i>

14:42.194 --> 14:43.828
<i>the best little worker</i>
<i>you can be...</i>

14:43.895 --> 14:45.929
Sit d--
get her to sit down.

14:45.997 --> 14:47.297
<i>...All to give yourself room</i>

14:47.365 --> 14:48.832
<i>to look for</i>
<i>the best opportunity</i>

14:48.900 --> 14:50.567
<i>to destroy the people</i>
<i>you're working for.</i>

14:50.634 --> 14:53.269
Hey! Blondie! Yeah.

14:53.337 --> 14:54.905
With the spiked hair.
Come here!

14:54.972 --> 14:56.806
Yeah, you!

14:56.874 --> 14:59.777
See anybody else
spiky and blond?

14:59.845 --> 15:01.379
Show me some I.D.

15:01.446 --> 15:03.180
What the hell's going on,
Michael?

15:03.248 --> 15:04.649
Tell me
you have a plan.

15:04.717 --> 15:06.384
I do, but I'm gonna need
your help.

15:07.652 --> 15:08.986
What a surprise.

15:09.054 --> 15:11.022
Okay, smart lady,
you're gonna have a job.

15:11.090 --> 15:12.690
You're gonna keep everyone
in that room calm.

15:12.758 --> 15:13.892
You think
you can do that?

15:13.959 --> 15:15.827
- I think I can do that.
- Good. Go sit down.

15:15.895 --> 15:17.329
Get her to sit down.
Come on.

15:17.396 --> 15:19.798
Move it along.

15:25.438 --> 15:27.172
Next. Wait. Hold on.

15:27.240 --> 15:28.340
Where are the guys?
I need a guy.

15:28.407 --> 15:31.076
I need a "Jack Marsden."

15:31.144 --> 15:33.011
Jack Marsden?

15:33.079 --> 15:34.813
Uh, there's no other guys
in here.

15:34.880 --> 15:35.881
Damn it.

15:37.984 --> 15:39.684
Gentlemen,
we got a problem.

15:39.752 --> 15:42.053
- What kind of problem?
- Oh, nothing too big.

15:42.121 --> 15:44.789
Just my hostage count was off
and we're missing someone.

15:44.857 --> 15:46.157
Who?

15:46.225 --> 15:47.659
Jack Marsden.

15:47.726 --> 15:49.160
Works in
the maintenance hangar.

15:49.228 --> 15:51.129
No way. We cleared
all the buildings.

15:51.197 --> 15:54.432
The computer doesn't lie.
Somebody is missing!

15:54.500 --> 15:57.802
I don't know
who the hell you think you are,

15:57.870 --> 15:59.538
but I don't appreciate
being yelled at.

15:59.606 --> 16:03.342
Well, I don't appreciate working
on a job run by amateurs!

16:03.410 --> 16:04.977
Maybe you're not worried
about jail,

16:05.044 --> 16:06.679
but I am certainly
not going back!

16:06.746 --> 16:08.881
Now, the computer says
that Marsden's office

16:08.948 --> 16:10.649
is over
in the maintenance hangar.

16:10.717 --> 16:12.151
Why don't you
let me handle this?

16:12.219 --> 16:14.419
I'll go over there,
check it out.

16:16.656 --> 16:19.725
Send Landes with him.
I'm not taking any chances.

16:22.395 --> 16:24.930
Man, like Ward said,
we checked this building.

16:24.998 --> 16:28.033
No one's here.
You got your count wrong.

16:31.203 --> 16:33.304
If I got my count wrong...

16:33.372 --> 16:35.940
Why is this coffee
still hot?!

16:36.008 --> 16:37.709
Son of a bitch!

16:37.776 --> 16:40.045
- He's around here somewhere!
- Man, calm down!

16:40.113 --> 16:42.414
No, I'm not gonna calm down until I
find this guy, and I know he's here.

16:42.482 --> 16:44.883
And I'm gonna tear this place
upside down to find him!

16:46.386 --> 16:48.821
You should go check
the perimeter.

16:48.889 --> 16:50.856
Holcomb didn't say anything
about splitting up.

16:50.924 --> 16:53.392
Yeah, Holcomb didn't say anything
about screwing up, either.

16:53.460 --> 16:55.761
You want to be the guy that tells him
we missed this guy <i>again?</i>

16:55.829 --> 16:58.064
Go back to the S.U.V.
after you check the perimeter.

16:58.131 --> 16:59.666
I'll meet you there.

16:59.733 --> 17:01.234
I'll meet you there!

17:01.302 --> 17:03.670
Let's go!
Let's find this guy!

17:03.738 --> 17:05.704
Come on!

17:10.810 --> 17:12.242
Mike, thank God.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.145
I was getting a little worried,
man. What's going on?

17:14.213 --> 17:15.814
Hey, Jesse,
we have a hostage situation.

17:15.882 --> 17:17.782
Holcomb and three other guys
have locked down the airport.

17:17.849 --> 17:19.784
They've got MAC-10s
and grenades.

17:19.852 --> 17:21.353
Wait. Wait a minute.
What?

17:21.420 --> 17:23.489
Yeah, your thieves aren't hacking
airport computers, Jesse.

17:23.556 --> 17:25.458
They're looking to drain
Gronbach's bank account.

17:25.525 --> 17:27.727
Jesus. W-we got to
call the cops, man.

17:27.794 --> 17:29.295
No. If we want
to keep everyone alive,

17:29.363 --> 17:30.930
our only move
is to create a distraction

17:30.998 --> 17:33.066
and get the hostages out.

17:33.134 --> 17:34.801
Yeah. What --
what do you want me to do?

17:34.869 --> 17:36.703
I need you to cut a hole through the
fence near the southwest hangar.

17:36.770 --> 17:39.071
That's the way
we're gonna try to escape.

17:39.139 --> 17:40.773
Okay, Mike, I don't mean
to second-guess you,

17:40.841 --> 17:42.708
but how are you gonna distract
four guys with MAC-10s?

17:42.776 --> 17:44.510
I'm working on that.
I'll call you later.

17:46.112 --> 17:48.479
<i>To improvise a weapon,</i>
<i>you have to understand</i>

17:48.547 --> 17:51.315
<i>the basic principle</i>
<i>behind whatever you're making.</i>

17:51.383 --> 17:54.451
<i>A gun, for example, is just</i>
<i>a barrel and a firing pin...</i>

17:56.388 --> 17:59.190
<i>...while a time-delay bomb</i>
<i>can be as simple</i>

17:59.257 --> 18:02.759
<i>as a corrosive chemical,</i>
<i>an oxidizing agent,</i>

18:02.827 --> 18:04.128
<i>and something to keep them</i>

18:04.195 --> 18:05.730
<i>from mixing together</i>
<i>long enough</i>

18:05.797 --> 18:07.898
<i>so you don't blow</i>
<i>your hands off.</i>

18:17.342 --> 18:19.024
Marsden wasn't in the building.
Did you see him out here?

18:19.025 --> 18:21.534
No, man. There's no one
out here. What's that?

18:21.535 --> 18:23.035
These are his papers.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.948
I took everything he had
in his desk, you know --

18:25.008 --> 18:26.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever.

18:26.092 --> 18:26.992
Just hurry up
and put it in the trunk.

18:27.060 --> 18:28.860
We got to get back.

18:28.928 --> 18:31.163
Holcomb's gonna be pissed!

18:43.811 --> 18:45.078
Jesus, Fi.

18:45.146 --> 18:46.914
The guy in the trunk
needs to be alive

18:46.982 --> 18:48.683
to do his fancy
computer work later.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.284
I just want
to get this over with,

18:50.352 --> 18:52.053
give Michael what he wants,
and be done with it.

18:53.556 --> 18:56.457
Not to pry, but is there
something with you and Mike?

18:56.525 --> 18:58.426
I mean, ever since you guys
moved in together,

18:58.493 --> 19:00.027
it seems like things
have been a little tense.

19:00.095 --> 19:02.163
I'd be happy with tense.

19:02.231 --> 19:04.399
Michael can find room for my
snow globes in his apartment,

19:04.466 --> 19:06.701
but he can't seem to figure out
how I fit into his life.

19:06.768 --> 19:09.170
Well, you know how Mikey is
with commitment.

19:09.237 --> 19:11.405
You know, I really don't want to
talk about his issues right now.

19:11.473 --> 19:12.806
I have issues of my own.

19:12.874 --> 19:16.543
I am driving around with an
unconscious man in my trunk.

19:16.611 --> 19:18.045
Correction --

19:18.113 --> 19:19.981
I am driving around with an
unconscious man in my trunk...

19:20.048 --> 19:21.850
And a cop trying
to pull me over.

19:21.917 --> 19:24.953
Aw, crap. Do you think someone
spotted us nabbing Dixon?

19:25.021 --> 19:26.355
We're not gonna stick around
to find out.

19:32.763 --> 19:34.430
- Landes, you find anything?
- Yeah, we found a --

19:34.498 --> 19:36.198
We found a cup
of steaming coffee

19:36.266 --> 19:39.802
on top of some half-finished
paperwork on Marsden's desk.

19:39.869 --> 19:41.170
Hot coffee?

19:41.238 --> 19:42.471
Which means
we just missed him.

19:42.539 --> 19:44.106
Now, I know he's out there
somewhere.

19:44.174 --> 19:45.908
We should organize
a search.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.477
I'll stay with the hostages.
You guys --

19:47.545 --> 19:49.446
Who the hell do you think
you are, giving orders?

19:49.513 --> 19:52.382
You are just the
keyboard monkey, remember?

19:52.450 --> 19:53.583
And I'm not convinced

19:53.651 --> 19:55.218
of anything this guy says,
all right?

19:55.286 --> 19:57.454
W-what does
a cup of coffee prove?

19:57.522 --> 19:59.589
We don't even know that
anybody's really out there.

20:07.431 --> 20:08.498
Outside!

20:19.410 --> 20:21.378
He couldn't have gone far.

20:21.446 --> 20:22.879
Spread out, find him.
Find him!

20:36.995 --> 20:38.294
Aah!

20:38.362 --> 20:40.330
It came from the roof!
It came from the roof!

20:40.397 --> 20:41.831
It's Marsden!

20:49.006 --> 20:51.741
Hey, chief, you and me
need to have a chat

20:51.808 --> 20:54.544
about your perfect
little plan.

21:02.565 --> 21:04.600
Mike, there you are. Dude,
I was about 60 seconds away

21:04.668 --> 21:06.802
from calling the boys in blue
and hoping for the best.

21:06.870 --> 21:08.971
Not yet. We're still the best
chance the hostages have

21:09.039 --> 21:10.273
of getting out of here
alive.

21:10.341 --> 21:12.275
Yeah? Then why did I just see
a truck explode?

21:12.343 --> 21:14.343
I told Holcomb his team
missed a maintenance man

21:14.411 --> 21:15.712
when they were rounding
everybody up.

21:15.779 --> 21:18.113
If I can get his team
to start a manhunt...

21:18.181 --> 21:19.882
Then we might able to get the
hostages out. Okay. I like it.

21:19.950 --> 21:21.817
All right, well, there's
a nice big hole in the fence

21:21.884 --> 21:23.351
by the southwest hangar
whenever you're ready.

21:23.419 --> 21:25.086
Well, there's
one more problem.

21:25.154 --> 21:27.655
Gronbach's plane is scheduled
to arrive in one hour.

21:27.723 --> 21:30.758
When he lands, Holcomb's gonna
kill his security team

21:30.825 --> 21:32.326
and kidnap him.

21:32.393 --> 21:34.394
All right, well, I-I guess
I can't let that plane land.

21:34.462 --> 21:35.763
All right. I'm on it.

21:35.831 --> 21:37.932
Bad news, guys.

21:39.034 --> 21:41.970
Turns out Marsden's
an explosives expert.

21:42.037 --> 21:43.338
Explosives expert?

21:43.405 --> 21:45.107
You said he worked
in maintenance.

21:45.174 --> 21:46.708
Well, apparently,
blowing things up

21:46.776 --> 21:48.410
is one of the few tricks
he picked up

21:48.478 --> 21:49.812
from the Special Forces.

21:49.879 --> 21:51.680
Special Forces?
What are you talking about?

21:51.748 --> 21:53.182
I checked
his employment records.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.317
You're dealing with
a highly trained ex-Ranger.

21:55.385 --> 21:57.620
He probably overheard your
warning about calling the cops

21:57.687 --> 21:59.154
and took matters
into his own hands.

21:59.222 --> 22:02.057
Oh, s-so he's trying
to save the hostages?

22:02.125 --> 22:03.992
How about we threaten
to kill the hostages

22:04.060 --> 22:06.028
unless he surrenders?

22:06.096 --> 22:07.379
How are you gonna get
that message to him,

22:07.404 --> 22:08.804
smart guy? Telepathy?

22:09.098 --> 22:12.200
He's right. Our only option
is to find him.

22:12.268 --> 22:14.369
- Take him out.
- Yeah.

22:14.437 --> 22:15.637
There was a machine shop

22:15.705 --> 22:17.506
on the northeast corner
of the tarmac.

22:17.574 --> 22:19.275
He probably
made the bomb there.

22:19.342 --> 22:21.077
That's as good a place
to start as any.

22:21.144 --> 22:23.479
You leave a gun with me,
and I'll watch the hostages.

22:23.547 --> 22:25.682
Landes,
stay here with Graham.

22:25.750 --> 22:28.552
Are you insane? You saw
what this guy is capable of.

22:28.620 --> 22:31.256
You're gonna need every member
of your team to handle him.

22:31.323 --> 22:34.292
As far as I know, he could be
on his way back here.

22:34.360 --> 22:37.395
And besides, if the hostages
become a liability,

22:37.463 --> 22:39.730
I need somebody here
who likes to do dirty work.

22:39.798 --> 22:41.832
Landes stays.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.102
All right, guys.
Time to go hunting.

22:46.905 --> 22:49.740
<i>If you need to redirect</i>
<i>an airplane mid-flight</i>

22:49.808 --> 22:51.809
<i>and you can't get</i>
<i>to the airport,</i>

22:51.876 --> 22:54.844
<i>your best bet is probably</i>
<i>the local TRACON relay station.</i>

22:54.912 --> 22:56.947
<i>Responsible</i>
<i>for guiding aircraft</i>

22:57.015 --> 22:59.249
<i>until airport traffic control</i>
<i>takes over,</i>

22:59.316 --> 23:02.485
<i>their job is to keep anything</i>
<i>bad from happening mid-flight.</i>

23:02.553 --> 23:04.787
<i>Fortunately, their job</i>
<i>is also to be nervous,</i>

23:04.855 --> 23:07.390
<i>so it doesn't take much</i>
<i>to spook them.</i>

23:07.457 --> 23:10.126
Caleb, we might have
a problem.

23:10.194 --> 23:12.028
Agent Loman, FBI.

23:12.095 --> 23:13.696
We <i>absolutely</i> have
a problem.

23:13.764 --> 23:15.331
FBI?

23:15.399 --> 23:16.799
He said it involved
national security.

23:16.866 --> 23:20.302
Yeah, I did, so why the hell
are you still standing here?

23:20.370 --> 23:22.738
Okay, uh, what's up?

23:22.806 --> 23:24.507
"What's up?"

23:24.575 --> 23:26.175
You guys didn't send
a redirect confirmation

23:26.243 --> 23:27.844
for North Dade Airport,
so, my boss calls me,

23:27.912 --> 23:29.712
tells me to come down here
in person.

23:29.780 --> 23:32.015
So instead of finishing my prime rib
and garlic mashed potatoes,

23:32.083 --> 23:33.817
here I am with you jackasses --
that's what's up.

23:33.884 --> 23:35.285
What redirect?

23:35.353 --> 23:36.620
You got jokes?

23:36.687 --> 23:39.523
No, no. I just -- I never
received a request for it.

23:39.590 --> 23:41.524
Are you kidding me?
Oh, my God.

23:41.592 --> 23:42.959
What's going on?

23:43.027 --> 23:45.762
The CIA has a covert flight
scheduled to take off

23:45.829 --> 23:48.131
from North Dade Airport
this afternoon.

23:48.199 --> 23:50.333
I sent out a request
<i>last week</i>

23:50.401 --> 23:53.036
to have all air traffic diverted
for the next two hours.

23:53.104 --> 23:55.339
And now I get word that there's
a flight headed that way.

23:55.406 --> 23:56.940
Oh, God. Yeah.

23:57.008 --> 23:59.476
Uh, we have
a private jet inbound.

23:59.544 --> 24:01.645
- Send it away. Send it away. Now!
- I-I can't!

24:01.713 --> 24:03.013
I-I don't have
authorization.

24:03.081 --> 24:04.448
You don't have auth--

24:04.516 --> 24:06.884
he -- he needs authorization.
You need authorization.

24:06.952 --> 24:09.153
Okay, yeah.
Call Arnold Logan, NTSB.

24:09.221 --> 24:11.021
No, no. Better yet,
call my boss --

24:11.089 --> 24:12.256
Agent Ramirez,
from the FBI.

24:12.324 --> 24:13.991
You want to bother him
while he's golfing?

24:14.059 --> 24:15.593
Here you go.
I got him on speed dial.

24:15.661 --> 24:17.061
No, let's go big.
Let's go big.

24:17.129 --> 24:19.330
Call the President of
the United States of America.

24:19.397 --> 24:21.865
He will tell you,
if you want to keep your job,

24:21.933 --> 24:23.566
you will keep
my runways clear.

24:23.634 --> 24:25.568
No, no, no.
All right, all right.

24:25.636 --> 24:28.737
Control to Gronbach,
Flight 6-2-1-6-Juliet.

24:28.805 --> 24:31.540
You are no longer authorized
to land at North Dade Airport.

24:31.608 --> 24:34.610
Please stand by to redirect
to Fort Lauderdale. Over.

24:34.678 --> 24:37.914
Copy that. Adjusting
course for Fort Lauderdale.

24:37.982 --> 24:40.183
Okay. Good. All right.

24:40.251 --> 24:41.452
Nice work.

24:41.519 --> 24:43.654
Nice work, everybody.
Huh?

24:43.722 --> 24:45.390
Good job.

24:45.457 --> 24:47.358
You made America
a little safer.

24:53.199 --> 24:55.100
Well, I think
we lost the cops.

24:55.167 --> 24:56.401
I just want to know

24:56.469 --> 24:58.269
how the hell they found us
in the first place.

24:59.805 --> 25:01.272
You guys suck!

25:01.340 --> 25:02.640
Hey, I've ridden in there.

25:02.708 --> 25:04.609
As trunks go,
it's not so bad.

25:04.677 --> 25:08.379
Uh, Sam, I think I know
how the cops found us.

25:08.446 --> 25:10.681
Dixon here
likes to accessorize.

25:10.749 --> 25:12.683
You're under house arrest?
Why didn't you say something?

25:12.751 --> 25:14.251
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I forget to mention that

25:14.319 --> 25:15.886
when I was unconscious?

25:15.954 --> 25:18.523
And I'm unconscious
because <i>you</i> tased me.

25:18.591 --> 25:20.425
Uh, technically,
she tased you.

25:20.493 --> 25:22.461
I don't want to go to jail.
I can't go to jail.

25:22.529 --> 25:23.729
Okay, look, I'm sorry.

25:23.797 --> 25:26.166
M-maybe this is fixable.
What are you in for?

25:26.233 --> 25:28.535
I was just hiding some money
for these developers.

25:28.603 --> 25:30.103
It was actually
a huge misunderstanding.

25:30.171 --> 25:31.571
Okay, so,
how about this --

25:31.639 --> 25:33.507
you help us
with our computer problem,

25:33.575 --> 25:35.609
I'll call in a favor
with my cop buddy,

25:35.677 --> 25:36.910
see what we can work out?

25:36.978 --> 25:39.713
So you're saying
that if I do you a favor

25:39.781 --> 25:42.282
that you'll <i>attempt</i>
<i>to solve the problem</i>

25:42.350 --> 25:43.650
that you just created
for me?

25:43.718 --> 25:44.684
So it's a deal?

25:46.420 --> 25:48.288
Fine. Fine. Fine!

25:48.356 --> 25:49.622
But just to remind you,

25:49.690 --> 25:51.457
um, I'm sending out
a "Come and get me" signal.

25:51.525 --> 25:53.225
My -- my lab is probably
crawling with cops.

25:53.293 --> 25:54.893
Oh, one problem
at a time.

25:56.797 --> 25:59.699
<i>Anyone who's used a cellphone</i>
<i>near an alarm clock</i>

25:59.766 --> 26:02.936
<i>knows even minor interference</i>
<i>disrupts radio signals.</i>

26:03.004 --> 26:04.872
<i>So if radio silence</i>
<i>is your goal,</i>

26:04.940 --> 26:06.774
<i>you can create an electromagnet</i>

26:06.842 --> 26:09.977
<i>by running the current from</i>
<i>your car's electrical system</i>

26:10.045 --> 26:12.914
<i>through a tire iron wrapped</i>
<i>with copper speaker wiring.</i>

26:12.982 --> 26:15.450
<i>It's hard on your car's</i>
<i>audio system,</i>

26:15.517 --> 26:19.587
<i>but it's a small price to pay</i>
<i>for staying out of prison.</i>

26:19.655 --> 26:22.189
Do you see
Marsden over there?

26:22.257 --> 26:24.092
No, we haven't seen
any sign of him here.

26:24.159 --> 26:26.527
Uh-huh. Okay.

26:26.595 --> 26:28.695
I'll call you back in 10.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.299
There's no reason to think
they're gonna let us go.

26:32.367 --> 26:34.701
I mean, you hear about
these hostage situations.

26:34.769 --> 26:38.272
They always end badly.
Like...

26:38.339 --> 26:41.008
R-remember that -- t-that
thing in India, where they --

26:41.075 --> 26:43.644
Judy. Judy, honey.
We're gonna be fine.

26:43.711 --> 26:45.479
We just have to stay calm

26:45.546 --> 26:47.114
and not get each other
worked up.

26:47.181 --> 26:47.914
Hey, sit down, lady!

26:50.384 --> 26:52.786
You heard the man.
Sit down!

26:55.690 --> 26:58.492
I need you to make a scene
right now.

26:58.560 --> 27:00.794
Get your hands off me!

27:00.862 --> 27:02.329
You told me you wanted me
to keep these people calm,

27:02.397 --> 27:03.830
and that's what I'm doing!

27:03.898 --> 27:05.365
And I want you
to sit down now!

27:05.433 --> 27:07.067
And I will!
When I'm done!

27:07.135 --> 27:08.735
You're done right now!
Let's go.

27:08.803 --> 27:10.204
Hey, let her go!

27:10.272 --> 27:12.273
Sit down!

27:22.984 --> 27:25.251
It's all right.
I'm here to help.

27:25.319 --> 27:27.320
I'm one of the good guys.

27:28.255 --> 27:30.890
Judy, do you have any
tranquilizers in your purse?

27:30.957 --> 27:33.392
How -- how did you know?

27:33.460 --> 27:36.129
Uh, you just seem
like the type, honey.

27:36.197 --> 27:38.065
Could we have them?

27:38.133 --> 27:40.200
Now, we have help
on the outside.

27:40.268 --> 27:43.304
So I need everyone
to go out the back way

27:43.372 --> 27:45.373
and head for the fence,
and we need to go right now.

27:45.441 --> 27:47.108
Hold on! You were working
with these guys, all right?

27:47.176 --> 27:48.476
How can we trust you?

27:48.544 --> 27:49.944
Because he's my son.

27:52.047 --> 27:53.227
And I'll tell you all about it

27:53.232 --> 27:54.915
when we get on
the other side of the fence.

27:54.916 --> 27:56.083
Now, are we going?

27:57.886 --> 28:00.254
Or do you want to wait for
this guy's friends to get back?

28:00.321 --> 28:02.189
This'll keep him out
for a while.

28:02.257 --> 28:04.157
He's right.
W-we need to go.

28:04.225 --> 28:06.226
I know a back way
to the fence.

28:06.293 --> 28:09.295
All right, all right. I'm ready.
Come on. Let's go.

28:09.363 --> 28:11.230
Single file. Keep it quiet.
Let's go.

28:13.333 --> 28:15.401
Move, move, move. Come on.

28:15.468 --> 28:17.503
Just move. Keep moving.

28:17.571 --> 28:19.639
That's it. Go. Mnh.

28:41.498 --> 28:43.832
All right, we need to head
to that fence line.

28:43.900 --> 28:45.734
There's an opening there.

28:45.802 --> 28:48.136
You all need to run as fast as you
can, and you do not look back.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.038
You want us to run
from here to there?

28:50.106 --> 28:52.040
We'll never make it.
We'll be seen.

28:52.107 --> 28:54.142
The only way that happens is if we
stay here and keep talking about this.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.177
- We got to move now!
- Michael.

28:56.245 --> 28:57.379
It's too late.

28:59.850 --> 29:01.183
Damn it.

29:06.289 --> 29:09.024
New plan -- you're all going
to that warehouse.

29:09.092 --> 29:11.660
It's closer, but we're still
gonna be out in the open.

29:11.728 --> 29:13.229
Won't they see us?

29:13.296 --> 29:15.097
Trust me --
they won't be looking at you.

29:15.165 --> 29:17.233
I need you
to collect everybody

29:17.300 --> 29:19.535
as close as you can
to that warehouse.

29:19.603 --> 29:22.071
You wait for my signal and
then you move. Do it now. Go.

29:24.541 --> 29:27.910
<i>Wool or silk ties</i>
<i>are considered higher-quality</i>

29:27.978 --> 29:29.978
<i>than the polyester variety.</i>

29:30.046 --> 29:32.815
<i>Polyester ties do have</i>
<i>certain advantages, however.</i>

29:32.883 --> 29:35.718
<i>They're less expensive</i>
<i>and considerably more flammable</i>

29:35.785 --> 29:37.352
<i>than natural fibers,</i>

29:37.420 --> 29:40.389
<i>making them the tie of choice</i>
<i>to ignite a gas tank.</i>

30:11.488 --> 30:13.389
<i>In any kind</i>
<i>of sabotage operation,</i>

30:13.456 --> 30:14.990
<i>the most important thing</i>

30:15.058 --> 30:17.593
<i>is keeping your enemy thinking</i>
<i>you're on his side.</i>

30:17.660 --> 30:20.863
<i>That means selling your story</i>
<i>by any means necessary.</i>

30:27.737 --> 30:29.571
<i>While it may be painful</i>
<i>and unpleasant,</i>

30:29.639 --> 30:31.173
<i>nothing sells loyalty</i>

30:31.240 --> 30:34.376
<i>like shedding a little blood</i>
<i>for the cause.</i>

30:47.559 --> 30:49.761
What the hell happened?

30:49.829 --> 30:51.563
Where are my hostages?

30:51.631 --> 30:52.898
They were here.
They were here.

30:52.966 --> 30:54.066
They --
he must have took them.

30:54.134 --> 30:56.535
Who? Marsden?

30:56.603 --> 30:58.705
He got the drop on us.

30:58.772 --> 31:00.339
He smashed my head
through the table.

31:00.407 --> 31:01.875
Boss, we got a problem.

31:01.942 --> 31:03.510
Fuller called
from the control tower.

31:03.577 --> 31:05.511
Gronbach's jet's been diverted
to another airport.

31:05.579 --> 31:08.046
What? Why?!
I don't know, all right?

31:08.114 --> 31:09.948
He just said it changed course
and it's headed north.

31:13.886 --> 31:18.357
So, Marsden manages to divert
a plane mid-flight...

31:18.425 --> 31:20.292
he takes my hostages...

31:20.360 --> 31:22.428
he goes to all this trouble
to stop <i>us,</i>

31:22.496 --> 31:24.597
but he leaves you alive.

31:24.665 --> 31:26.767
Our payday is flying away,
and you're concerned

31:26.835 --> 31:29.003
Marsden isn't killing us
quick enough?

31:29.070 --> 31:32.774
I am concerned that he seems
to know all of our moves

31:32.842 --> 31:34.042
before we make them.

31:34.110 --> 31:35.977
But you know
everything about him.

31:36.045 --> 31:38.246
In fact, you're the only one
who's ever seen him.

31:38.314 --> 31:39.447
Why is that?

31:39.515 --> 31:41.183
I don't know why.

31:41.250 --> 31:42.651
I've got a theory.

31:44.988 --> 31:47.590
You and Marsden
are working together.

31:51.232 --> 31:53.141
I have had <i>enough</i> of your lies.

31:53.142 --> 31:54.773
I want to know
where the hostages are,

31:54.774 --> 31:56.174
and I want to know now!

31:56.242 --> 31:58.076
- How the hell would I know that?
- Stop it!

31:58.144 --> 31:59.711
Admit it you're working
with Marsden.

31:59.779 --> 32:02.714
I'm not. Think about it. I'm
the one who told <i>you</i> about <i>him!</i>

32:02.781 --> 32:05.616
I told you his name,
where he is, how to find him!

32:05.684 --> 32:07.251
So you could send us
on a wild-goose chase,

32:07.318 --> 32:09.119
you son of a bitch!

32:09.187 --> 32:11.421
So you could lead Marsden
to the hostages!

32:11.488 --> 32:13.489
Why the hell
would I do that?

32:13.557 --> 32:15.658
This was supposed to
be my big score.

32:15.725 --> 32:18.961
I heard voices coming
from one of the warehouses.

32:19.028 --> 32:20.429
I think the hostages
are in there.

32:20.496 --> 32:23.832
Guys, you need to forget
about the hostages.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.835
All right?

32:25.902 --> 32:27.937
Marsden has them, and
he's probably called the cops.

32:28.005 --> 32:29.872
They're probably on their way
here right now!

32:29.940 --> 32:31.641
- No.
- We got to go!

32:31.709 --> 32:33.877
I'm not leaving
any witnesses alive.

32:33.945 --> 32:36.514
They all die.
But first...

32:36.582 --> 32:37.715
<i>You</i> do.

32:37.783 --> 32:39.617
I'll kill 'em.

32:39.685 --> 32:41.353
What?

32:41.420 --> 32:44.389
You want proof
that I'm not with Marsden?

32:44.457 --> 32:47.492
I'll kill him and the hostages.
I'll do it.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.129
But you got to promise me
you got someplace to go after,

32:50.197 --> 32:51.964
someplace the cops
can't find us.

32:52.031 --> 32:55.701
'Cause I am not going back
to the joint,

32:55.769 --> 32:58.137
not on a murder rap.

33:03.443 --> 33:05.944
We've got a room
at the Sea Oak Motel

33:06.012 --> 33:09.081
with new clothes,
I.D.s, cars.

33:09.149 --> 33:11.484
Holcomb, what the hell
are you doing, man?

33:11.552 --> 33:13.786
- We can't trust this guy.
- Maybe.

33:13.854 --> 33:15.455
Maybe not.

33:15.522 --> 33:17.056
Go in behind him.

33:17.124 --> 33:20.160
If he kills everyone,
we don't got a problem.

33:20.227 --> 33:22.695
If he doesn't...

33:22.763 --> 33:24.530
put two bullets
in the back of his head.

33:30.871 --> 33:34.240
<i>When you need to get into</i>
<i>a facility guarded by police,</i>

33:34.308 --> 33:35.541
<i>you have three options.</i>

33:35.609 --> 33:37.110
<i>You can go through them --</i>

33:37.177 --> 33:38.877
<i>not an option if you don't</i>
<i>want a body count.</i>

33:38.945 --> 33:40.479
<i>You can go around them,</i>
<i>which is tough</i>

33:40.547 --> 33:42.481
<i>if there's</i>
<i>a full surveillance team,</i>

33:42.549 --> 33:44.817
<i>or you can give them</i>
<i>a reason to leave.</i>

33:44.885 --> 33:46.685
Okay, fi,
we got two cop cars

33:46.753 --> 33:50.373
and four plainclothes officers
sitting on Dixon's computer lab.

33:50.374 --> 33:51.449
Don't worry, Sam.

33:51.451 --> 33:53.006
We'll get him working on
that hard drive soon enough.

33:53.526 --> 33:56.161
Dixon's ankle bracelet
is live.

33:57.096 --> 33:59.731
Okay.

33:59.799 --> 34:01.933
Yeah. It's working.
Hey, Fi, um...

34:02.001 --> 34:03.802
if I were you, I'd get out
of there, like, now.

34:03.869 --> 34:07.571
Relax. I've got to make it
a fair fight, or else...

34:07.639 --> 34:08.873
where's the fun in it?

34:14.545 --> 34:17.047
Okay, Dixon,
time to get your mojo working

34:17.114 --> 34:19.081
on that scrap heap.

34:22.518 --> 34:24.587
It's not too late
to surrender.

34:25.554 --> 34:27.290
No.
If we do, we all die.

34:28.458 --> 34:31.395
My son will get us
out of this.

34:31.463 --> 34:33.063
All right, but how?
He's one man!

34:33.130 --> 34:35.199
What hope does he stand
against all of them?

34:35.266 --> 34:38.370
M-maybe she's right.
We should give ourselves up.

34:38.438 --> 34:41.440
Who says t-they'll kill us?
They weren't going to before.

34:41.507 --> 34:44.342
We've already run once. They're
not gonna risk that again.

34:44.411 --> 34:46.612
If we surrender,
they're gonna kill us.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.715
If we stay and fight,
you know, we have a chance.

34:51.318 --> 34:53.818
Oh, my God.
They're coming.

34:53.886 --> 34:57.254
Um, okay,
we move to the back.

35:02.360 --> 35:04.829
Okay, anyone who wants to die
can stay here.

35:04.896 --> 35:06.063
If you don't, follow me.

35:20.881 --> 35:23.149
Sounds like
they're out back.

35:23.217 --> 35:26.085
We can use the crates as cover
to get closer.

35:26.153 --> 35:28.555
I'll cover you.

35:28.623 --> 35:31.424
You first, killer.

35:38.698 --> 35:40.398
See, I --

35:40.466 --> 35:41.899
I-I knew we should've
surrendered.

35:41.967 --> 35:43.767
- They're gonna shoot us!
- Quiet!

35:43.835 --> 35:46.103
Why is your son here
with a gun

35:46.171 --> 35:48.539
- if he's supposed to be on our side?!
- Shh! Quiet!

35:50.308 --> 35:52.342
Put the gun down.

36:15.370 --> 36:17.438
Unh-unh-unh-unh.

36:19.275 --> 36:21.576
I'm done playing games.

36:22.812 --> 36:24.279
Tell me where Marsden is.

36:27.984 --> 36:30.352
Here's Marsden,
you son of a bitch.

36:30.420 --> 36:32.021
Thanks, Ma.

36:35.425 --> 36:37.392
What are you doing,
Michael?

36:37.460 --> 36:39.061
I'm putting blood
on my shirt.

36:39.129 --> 36:41.697
Well, that can't be
very sanitary.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.765
Ma, I need to look like
I've been fatally wounded.

36:43.833 --> 36:46.067
I'd rather not do it
with a real bullet.

36:46.135 --> 36:48.903
Ward? Graham?

36:48.970 --> 36:50.204
What's going on?!

36:53.975 --> 36:55.609
I need to go
back out there.

36:55.677 --> 36:58.111
When I'm clear, I need you
to shoot at the crates

36:58.179 --> 37:00.213
and then hide in the back
with the other hostages

37:00.281 --> 37:01.414
and have everyone
take cover.

37:01.482 --> 37:02.649
You ready?

37:02.716 --> 37:03.916
Yeah.

37:24.841 --> 37:26.475
What the hell happened?

37:26.543 --> 37:28.978
- Where's Ward?
- He didn't make it.

37:29.045 --> 37:31.113
Marsden was waiting
for us.

37:31.181 --> 37:32.614
Man, he caught me
in the liver.

37:32.682 --> 37:35.284
Move your hand.
I can stop the bleeding.

37:35.352 --> 37:37.520
Don't bother. It's over.

37:37.588 --> 37:40.690
I saw a guy in the joint
take a shiv in the same spot.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.259
That son of a bitch.

37:43.327 --> 37:46.094
I'm putting Marsden
in the ground right now.

37:46.162 --> 37:47.529
No, no, no, no.
I got an idea.

37:47.597 --> 37:49.698
Marsden said he wants us
to surrender.

37:49.765 --> 37:51.633
Oh, we are not
surrendering.

37:51.701 --> 37:52.834
You give me the grenade.

37:54.403 --> 37:55.937
I'll call Marsden out.

37:56.004 --> 37:57.805
I'll tell him...

37:57.873 --> 37:59.139
we're giving ourselves up.

38:01.142 --> 38:02.877
When I get close
to him and the hostages,

38:02.945 --> 38:05.013
I pull the pin.

38:05.080 --> 38:06.081
It'll kill them all.

38:09.185 --> 38:10.319
You would do that?

38:10.387 --> 38:13.657
When you get Gronbach,

38:13.724 --> 38:15.692
you take my cut,
you send it to my mom.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.528
She's in the old-folks home
in Homestead.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.266
Yeah.

38:22.334 --> 38:24.935
You have my word.

38:27.405 --> 38:30.473
Marsden!

38:30.541 --> 38:32.041
We want to talk!

38:32.109 --> 38:34.010
Don't shoot!

38:34.078 --> 38:36.044
We want to make a deal!

38:36.112 --> 38:38.713
Go. Go now.

38:45.121 --> 38:48.056
<i>In trench warfare,</i>
<i>a common practice</i>

38:48.124 --> 38:50.526
<i>is to dig a hole</i>
<i>called a grenade sump.</i>

38:50.594 --> 38:53.062
<i>It works on a simple principle.</i>

38:53.130 --> 38:54.697
<i>When a grenade falls</i>
<i>into your trench,</i>

38:54.765 --> 38:56.399
<i>you kick it into a deeper hole,</i>

38:56.467 --> 38:58.668
<i>which directs the force</i>
<i>of the grenade upward.</i>

38:58.736 --> 39:00.704
<i>The same idea can work</i>
<i>aboveground</i>

39:00.771 --> 39:03.873
<i>with large pieces of furniture.</i>

39:03.941 --> 39:07.310
That lowlife better not
be pulling something.

39:14.484 --> 39:17.420
That lowlife
just saved your ass.

39:17.487 --> 39:19.555
Show some respect.

39:24.193 --> 39:26.294
<i>Criminals often keep safehouses</i>

39:26.362 --> 39:29.097
<i>to fall back to</i>
<i>in case things go wrong.</i>

39:29.456 --> 39:31.057
<i>They know</i>
<i>that once they get there,</i>

39:31.125 --> 39:33.454
<i>they can relax and let</i>
<i>their guard down a little,</i>

39:34.538 --> 39:36.906
<i>which makes it a perfect place</i>
<i>to send the cops after them.</i>

39:36.974 --> 39:38.308
Down!
Down on the ground! Now!

39:41.112 --> 39:42.613
Hands where
we can see 'em!

39:42.681 --> 39:44.282
Up against the car!

39:44.349 --> 39:46.116
Down!

39:55.860 --> 39:59.062
You got to be kidding me.

40:02.834 --> 40:04.201
I know. I know.

40:04.268 --> 40:07.705
I owe you and your mom more
than a thank-you for this one.

40:07.772 --> 40:10.340
A new tie would be nice.

40:16.836 --> 40:17.542
Owh.

40:17.567 --> 40:18.827
Michael, what happened?

40:19.641 --> 40:21.342
Jesse's gig turned out

40:21.409 --> 40:24.912
to be a little more
than I bargained for.

40:24.980 --> 40:26.847
Well, you're lucky
you're already hurt.

40:26.915 --> 40:29.651
I was gonna beat the hell
out of you after the day we had.

40:29.718 --> 40:32.053
Did you find anything
on the computer?

40:34.224 --> 40:36.191
This should make you
feel better.

40:36.259 --> 40:38.627
Its gonna take time to make
sense of the information.

40:38.695 --> 40:41.029
A lot of it
was destroyed permanently.

40:41.097 --> 40:43.432
But now we have the name
of Max's killer --

40:43.500 --> 40:45.200
Tavian Korzha.

40:45.268 --> 40:46.635
And based
on his bank accounts,

40:46.703 --> 40:48.704
we know he was being financed
by somebody local.

40:48.771 --> 40:51.473
Well, we need to find out who
and pay them a visit.

40:51.541 --> 40:53.642
I can't stall Pearce
any longer.

40:53.710 --> 40:55.118
Michael, once she starts
going through your files,

40:55.119 --> 40:56.653
you're only gonna have
a couple of weeks, tops,

40:56.678 --> 40:57.878
before she'll be after you.

40:58.781 --> 41:01.616
Well, let's hope we find Tavian
before that.

41:01.684 --> 41:03.118
I should go.

41:03.186 --> 41:04.820
Pearce is waiting.

41:04.887 --> 41:06.154
Of course she is.

41:13.897 --> 41:15.564
Any progress?

41:15.632 --> 41:17.800
Haven't found anything yet.

41:17.867 --> 41:21.337
But now that we're chasing down
this Romanian lead,

41:21.404 --> 41:22.871
I think it's just
a matter of time

41:22.939 --> 41:24.873
before we find
Max's killer.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.810
You know the first thing I do
when I start an investigation?

41:27.878 --> 41:29.779
Put the victim's
next of kin's number

41:29.847 --> 41:31.948
at the top
of my speed dial.

41:32.016 --> 41:33.750
I -- it's --

41:33.817 --> 41:36.953
That's Max's wife's.

41:37.021 --> 41:39.456
I look at it every day,
and I think about the day

41:39.524 --> 41:41.791
I'll be able to call
and say...

41:41.859 --> 41:44.460
"We got the bastard."

41:44.528 --> 41:47.263
That day is close, Michael.

41:47.331 --> 41:48.598
And you will have been
a part of that.

41:50.368 --> 41:51.935
We have to
get rid of the gun.

41:52.003 --> 41:53.703
You are taking big risks.

41:53.771 --> 41:55.872
I covered my tracks, so I covered
the tracks of the killer.

41:57.208 --> 41:59.343
I can always do more.

41:59.411 --> 42:01.912
Are you sure you don't want me to
take another look at this stuff?

42:01.980 --> 42:03.414
Now you have two crime scenes
to process

42:03.482 --> 42:05.582
and a whole network of Romanians
to run down.

42:05.650 --> 42:07.418
Thanks, but I've got
three times the manpower

42:07.486 --> 42:09.086
working the case now.

42:09.154 --> 42:12.356
I just need
that one last piece, Michael.

42:14.960 --> 42:17.494
And maybe
it's in this box.
