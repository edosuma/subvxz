WEBVTT

00:00.416 --> 00:01.450
So how are you doing, Mr.
MacArthur?

00:01.584 --> 00:05.120
Pretty good. Any side effects
from the Andro-Lube? No, not really, no.

00:05.288 --> 00:06.838
I mean, except for the burning.
Ugh.

00:06.955 --> 00:08.436
Did you put it directly on
your penis?

00:08.508 --> 00:11.176
Yes, very generously.
We had a pretty thorough

00:11.294 --> 00:14.096
conversation about how you
should not put it directly onto

00:14.213 --> 00:15.931
your genitalia.
I don't recall that.

00:16.047 --> 00:19.079
You don't? They should probably put
that on the label. Oh, it's on there.

00:19.199 --> 00:21.034
Did you, uh, read the label?
Nope.

00:21.201 --> 00:22.535
Right, but it's effective for
you?

00:22.670 --> 00:24.871
Yes. Except, don't get it in
the hole, because then...

00:25.005 --> 00:26.339
You put it directly in the hole?

00:26.457 --> 00:28.091
Game-changing. Because I
figured, you know, why not start

00:28.208 --> 00:30.043
from the inside out?
Well, there are several

00:30.177 --> 00:31.377
medical reasons you wouldn't do
that.

00:31.545 --> 00:32.378
Horrible.
Uh-huh.

00:32.546 --> 00:34.347
Should I be worried?
In very rare cases, there are

00:34.465 --> 00:37.300
growths and tumors, but your
blood and urine samples should

00:37.434 --> 00:38.885
be back soon.
In the meantime, why don't we

00:39.053 --> 00:44.223
just do a manual check. Lift up the
hood, see what we got. All right.

00:44.358 --> 00:48.194
There we go. Got any big plans for
the weekend? Wouldn't say big.

00:48.312 --> 00:49.562
No?
How about you?

00:49.730 --> 00:51.981
Heading up to Lake Geneva
this weekend with my boyfriend.

00:52.116 --> 00:57.070
Boyfriend? Boy... There a problem
with that, Mr. MacArthur?

00:57.237 --> 01:00.656
No. No, no, no, no, no.
I love gay doctors.

01:00.791 --> 01:05.578
Oh, do you? Yes. My ear, nose and
throat guy: gay. Like, flaming gay.

01:05.746 --> 01:06.963
Flaming?
Flaming!

01:07.081 --> 01:08.414
So you think we're all flaming?

01:08.582 --> 01:10.083
I wouldn't put you in the
category of flaming.

01:10.217 --> 01:12.001
Mm-hmm.
He's in flaming.

01:12.136 --> 01:13.803
You're in Anderson Cooper.
I see.

01:13.921 --> 01:15.588
It seems like you're taking
this the wrong way.

01:15.756 --> 01:17.306
I'm saying you would love this
guy.

01:17.424 --> 01:19.342
You're trying to set me up
with him, is that it?

01:19.476 --> 01:21.427
Maybe. I-I mean...
Even though I've established

01:21.595 --> 01:24.147
I already have a boyfriend?
Because we're all promiscuous

01:24.264 --> 01:26.849
and we'll just sleep with anyone
that comes along.

01:26.984 --> 01:28.384
I thought that was one of the
perks.

01:28.485 --> 01:30.269
I think your lab work should
give us everything we need to

01:30.404 --> 01:33.656
know.
Have a good day, Mr. MacArthur.

01:33.774 --> 01:37.076
Enjoy Lake Geneva.
Use protection... sunscreen.

01:37.196 --> 01:41.829

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:41.949 --> 01:45.001
I know what I did was wrong, but
I just find it weird. I do.

01:45.119 --> 01:46.869
I disagree.
If you want the best penis

01:47.004 --> 01:49.372
doctor, you're not gonna find
anyone more expert than a gay

01:49.506 --> 01:50.746
- man.
- I mean, the man takes

01:50.841 --> 01:52.708
his work home with him.
Like me, his profession is his

01:52.843 --> 01:55.678
passion. JENNY: It's totally normal, Kevin.
You met my gynecologist...

01:55.796 --> 01:58.798
single, straight guy, drives a
motorcycle, really strong hands.

01:58.966 --> 02:00.800
All right, all right, all
right, thank you, thank you.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.552
But it's not weird.
No, it's weird.

02:02.686 --> 02:05.021
I mean, would you like if your
girlfriend went to a male

02:05.139 --> 02:07.190
gynecologist?
This is not an issue for me.

02:07.307 --> 02:09.525
Rosette and I broke up.
Those love pants didn't do

02:09.643 --> 02:11.644
- anyone any favors.
Hey-hey!

02:11.812 --> 02:13.646
Oh, my God.
Wow, wow, wow.

02:13.781 --> 02:15.231
Andre.
Look at this!

02:15.365 --> 02:19.068
Thank you very much. Did you Bling
Ring Elton John's house? Oh, the pink?

02:19.203 --> 02:21.320
I'm wearing it for Breast Cancer
Awareness Month.

02:21.488 --> 02:24.123
So you're telling us that you
purchased the hat, the shirt,

02:24.241 --> 02:27.043
the sweater and the shoes all
for Breast Cancer Awareness

02:27.161 --> 02:29.912
Month?
Well... I purchased them

02:30.047 --> 02:32.665
separately, but I thought this
was a great opportunity to

02:32.833 --> 02:34.550
wear...
You are so full of shit.

02:34.668 --> 02:37.670
Andre, look, if you want to wear
pink, just wear pink.

02:37.805 --> 02:40.506
You don't have to exploit breast
cancer awareness for your

02:40.641 --> 02:42.341
fashion purposes.
I'm not exploiting it.

02:42.509 --> 02:44.594
NFL players wear pink in
October.

02:44.728 --> 02:47.180
I'm like an NFL player.
Kevin, back us up on this.

02:47.347 --> 02:48.764
This is ridiculous, right?
I can't.

02:48.899 --> 02:50.683
I'm on homophobe probation.
Thank you.

02:50.851 --> 02:52.235
Oh, God.
No.

02:52.352 --> 02:54.103
I'm going to get a drink.
You're not seeing patients in

02:54.238 --> 02:58.274
that ensemble, are you? No. I have a
pair of pink scrubs, you dummy. Perfect.

02:58.408 --> 03:00.159
Hey, can I get another beer
please?

03:00.277 --> 03:04.363
Pete. What are you doing out
on a work night? Oh, hi, Amy.

03:04.531 --> 03:07.166
I'm trying not to get busted by
someone I work with.

03:07.284 --> 03:09.702
I won't tell the
King of Chardonnay unless you

03:09.870 --> 03:12.205
do.
Deal. I like your style.

03:12.372 --> 03:13.706
You look good out of the office.

03:13.874 --> 03:15.675
Well, you look good out of
the office, and you look good in

03:15.792 --> 03:17.760
the office.
Oh. Aren't you dating Rosette

03:17.878 --> 03:20.179
from digital marketing?
No. That is over.

03:20.297 --> 03:22.882
That ship has sailed.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:23.016 --> 03:25.184
I'm not that sorry.

03:25.302 --> 03:26.886
When's Ruxin coming back anyway?

03:27.020 --> 03:29.722
Who cares?
Guys, I just got a date.

03:29.857 --> 03:31.190
With who?
Back in the game.

03:31.308 --> 03:32.748
Check it out.
At the bar right there.

03:32.809 --> 03:34.310
Oh, the Asian girl?
Yeah.

03:34.444 --> 03:35.945
Yeah, but that's two Asian
girls in a row.

03:36.063 --> 03:37.196
So what?
Yeah, you can't do that.

03:37.314 --> 03:39.866
Why not? 'Cause that means you
have an Asian thing. Yeah.

03:39.983 --> 03:42.952
And girls don't want to date
a guy who has any kind of thing.

03:43.070 --> 03:45.510
Yeah. Then they wonder, like,
oh, is he into submissive girls?

03:45.622 --> 03:47.456
Has he been rejected by his own
kind?

03:47.574 --> 03:49.542
Is he only attracted to women
with boyish figures?

03:49.660 --> 03:54.046
Yeah, like Kevin. Hey, I don't have a
boyish figure. Whoa, I got a text from

03:54.164 --> 03:56.165
Korea.
It's Ruxin saying when he first

03:56.300 --> 03:58.634
met you, he thought you were a
pre-op transsexual.

03:58.752 --> 04:03.306
What? Are you just having that phone
on so Ruxin can insult me from Korea?

04:03.423 --> 04:05.641
No, that's from before.
He sent me a list of insults,

04:05.759 --> 04:09.128
and I junpet's appropriate.
Oh, here's one.

04:09.263 --> 04:11.964
"Pete, stop giving Kevin a hand
job underneath the table."

04:12.099 --> 04:13.549
Oh...
He apologizes.

04:13.717 --> 04:16.935
He says it's obvious, but he's
very busy.

04:19.356 --> 04:21.140
Hey.
Ah! Ellie, what the hell?

04:21.274 --> 04:22.725
Language.
It's for charity.

04:22.893 --> 04:25.361
You owe me a dollar.

04:25.479 --> 04:27.080
For this ribbon you just
stabbed me with?

04:27.147 --> 04:28.698
It's for breast cancer
awareness.

04:28.815 --> 04:30.700
Ellie, I'm aware.
You're aware.

04:30.817 --> 04:34.704
Nobody is not aware of breast
cancer.

04:34.821 --> 04:37.290
Fine, here.
Tell me when it's November.

04:37.407 --> 04:38.908
That's Bullying Awareness Month.

04:39.042 --> 04:41.410
Oh, that's more appropriate.
You know what, I'm done here.

04:41.578 --> 04:43.179
Do you want to just go for
frozen yogurt?

04:43.213 --> 04:46.249
Yeah.
Awesome. Help me up.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.918
Feral child.

04:51.588 --> 04:59.095
Mmm. Ooh. Mom, you have to weigh and
pay before you eat. Oh, please.

04:59.263 --> 05:00.763
I insist.
Really?

05:00.897 --> 05:03.149
You're very brave.
Thanks.

05:03.267 --> 05:08.437
Um... so are you.
Parents, right?

05:08.572 --> 05:12.024
Oh, it's on the house.
Really?

05:12.159 --> 05:13.743
Free yogurt?
All month long.

05:13.860 --> 05:15.745
Thank you.
Uh, there is one more though,

05:15.862 --> 05:17.780
and she's got, like, 40 bucks
worth of toppings.

05:17.914 --> 05:20.583
That's on us, too.
You are so brave.

05:20.701 --> 05:25.254
Wow. Um, thank you. My mom had
breast cancer, too. Really?

05:25.372 --> 05:27.039
Now it's just me and my daddy.

05:27.174 --> 05:28.708
I don't know how you juggle
it all.

05:28.842 --> 05:30.676
I know. These kids are a
nightmare.

05:30.794 --> 05:32.962
Ellie, come on.
Let's go. You've got enough.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.681
Thank you again so much.
I am coming back.

05:35.799 --> 05:38.434
Yes, you are gonna be back
for so many more free yogurts.

05:38.552 --> 05:42.438
Thank you. You just keep that
fighting spirit. You got this.

05:42.556 --> 05:44.076
What's up, Bill?
I've noticed something

05:44.191 --> 05:45.858
lately.
Something I didn't know before,

05:45.976 --> 05:47.977
and I'm frankly quite surprised.
Listen, if there's an issue,

05:48.111 --> 05:51.314
I'm happy to... I didn't know
you had an Asian thing. Right?

05:51.481 --> 05:54.700
Wait... uh, Bill, just
because I dated Rosette and

05:54.818 --> 05:56.652
now I think Amy's cool, it
doesn't mean I have an Asian

05:56.787 --> 05:59.905
thing. Listen, when you date two out
of my four Asians, that's a thing.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.824
It's not a big deal.
Everybody's got a thing.

06:01.958 --> 06:04.160
Myself... I'm into horsey-face
women.

06:04.294 --> 06:06.045
I'm sorry, did you say
"horsey-face women"?

06:06.163 --> 06:08.914
Uh-huh. Women with long jaws
and teeth.

06:09.049 --> 06:11.050
Nostrils that flare up when they
get angry.

06:11.168 --> 06:12.835
Or excited.
Okay, yeah, I got it.

06:12.969 --> 06:18.224
I guess... Got your Carly Simons, your
Alanis Morissettes. Hilary Swank, ooh.

06:18.342 --> 06:20.059
Wow.

06:20.177 --> 06:23.179
Yes? Mr. Haddock, we're ordering lunch.
What are you in the mood for?

06:23.347 --> 06:25.815
I don't know, what do you
think about some sushi, Pete?

06:25.932 --> 06:29.318
Okay, right.
 Time to pick a

06:29.436 --> 06:31.821
kicker, Chalupa Batman.
It's the having to eat your

06:31.938 --> 06:35.107
vegetables of the fantasy world.
Hey, guys.

06:35.242 --> 06:37.076
That new yogurt place is
amazing.

06:37.194 --> 06:39.314
They're just, like, doling out
free yogurt, "Come back

06:39.363 --> 06:40.946
anytime."
Really? They're nice, huh?

06:41.081 --> 06:42.948
Yeah, they were super nice.
You think they were nice

06:43.083 --> 06:44.750
because they think that you have
cancer?

06:44.868 --> 06:46.535
What?
Babe, they saw you in the

06:46.670 --> 06:48.537
bandana; that's what they think.
Just because I'm wearing a

06:48.672 --> 06:50.589
bandana, I have cancer?
I don't think so, Kevin.

06:50.707 --> 06:53.292
Yes! People equate bandanas
with cancer.

06:53.427 --> 06:55.761
Just like they equate fanny
packs with tourists.

06:55.879 --> 06:59.181
And-and long skirts and high
collars with bipolar, you know?

06:59.299 --> 07:01.851
It's a disease, that's what...
People put two and two together.

07:01.968 --> 07:03.269
Stop.
Speaking of disease, I need

07:03.387 --> 07:05.054
you to check this out.
What? We are not doing this

07:05.188 --> 07:06.472
in the dining room.
First of all, that has never

07:06.606 --> 07:09.608
stopped us before. Second of
all, this is bad, okay? Whoa!

07:09.726 --> 07:12.445
There is something wrong.
I went to Dr. Ewing, and he

07:12.562 --> 07:14.647
would not give me the
examination I needed him to.

07:14.781 --> 07:16.565
Is that how they do it?
So you got to do it.

07:16.700 --> 07:17.900
Give me your hand.
No, I'm not... no.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.403
It's called a self-exam
because you do it to yourself.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.955
When you invite someone else to
do it, it's foreplay, which I am

07:23.073 --> 07:26.158
down for, but not right now.
Early detection is the key.

07:26.293 --> 07:29.545
What if I end up losing one, or
maybe even both of my balls?

07:29.663 --> 07:31.247
I mean, they've kind of
served their purpose, right?

07:31.415 --> 07:33.582
You're being very dramatic.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.718
I think you've kind of become a
hypo-cock-driac.

07:35.836 --> 07:36.719
Oh, really?
Mm-hmm.

07:36.837 --> 07:38.337
Well, there's something
wrong, and you're gonna be real

07:38.472 --> 07:40.639
sad when we're burying my
testicles in the backyard.

07:40.757 --> 07:43.426
They're fine, I promise.
No, look at them please!

07:43.560 --> 07:47.096
No.
One's heavier than the other!

07:48.554 --> 07:51.050
I can't see Dr. Ewing for
another two weeks, so I don't

07:51.170 --> 07:52.890
know what to do.
I-I mean, there's something

07:52.922 --> 07:54.756
really wrong down there.
You have, like, testicular

07:54.874 --> 07:56.792
Munchausen's.
No, Andre, you would not know

07:56.926 --> 07:59.211
what it's like to have a pretty
cock and great balls.

07:59.379 --> 08:02.347
Now, granted, my cock has taken
some abuse over the years, with

08:02.465 --> 08:05.050
the naginata and the fire, but
my balls are still great.

08:05.184 --> 08:06.635
These are blue chip balls,
Andre.

08:06.769 --> 08:08.270
Okay, all right.
Why are we talking about balls

08:08.388 --> 08:11.473
so much, here? Isn't this Breast
Cancer Awareness Month? It is.

08:11.607 --> 08:14.226
You know we have to go to a
bake sale now at Ellie's school?

08:14.360 --> 08:16.361
For breast cancer awareness?
Yes.

08:16.479 --> 08:20.232
Can someone please explain to me
how selling me a snickerdoodle

08:20.366 --> 08:22.234
is going to cure the problem of
cancer?

08:22.368 --> 08:24.236
Well, we can't cure the
problem of cancer, but we can

08:24.404 --> 08:27.906
cure the problem of bye weeks if
you take Golden Tate and I take

08:28.041 --> 08:29.791
Torrey Smith.
It's a fair trade, am I right?

08:29.909 --> 08:31.877
Okay, fine, we can make
that... ouch!

08:31.995 --> 08:35.914
Jesus, Andre! How long have you been
single now? I don't know, like, what,

08:36.049 --> 08:38.216
like 13 months and five days?

08:38.333 --> 08:39.918
Oh.
Salami vice.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.919
Yeah, he's got salami vice.
He's got that death grip.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.255
How many times a week you
jerk off, Andre?

08:43.423 --> 08:44.923
30? 40?
Okay, I am not sitting around

08:45.091 --> 08:47.676
my apartment jerking off, okay?
Trixie and I had a very

08:47.810 --> 08:50.929
passionate love life and that
fire burned very hot...

08:51.064 --> 08:53.598
- Ugh... - ...and I need to keep on
putting coal into that furnace...

08:53.733 --> 08:55.100
No, no...
Okay, all right, enough.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.903
Gentlemen.
Now that Taco Corp's made the

08:58.021 --> 09:01.323
nut of all nuts, I've decided to
give back to society.

09:01.441 --> 09:03.608
Taco Corp has started a
charitable wing called Taco

09:03.776 --> 09:08.080
Cares and our first initiative
is Breast Awareness Month.

09:08.197 --> 09:10.832
Breast <i> Cancer</i> Awareness.
No, no, no, no.

09:10.950 --> 09:13.835
See, that's the problem.
Why celebrate the cancer?

09:13.953 --> 09:15.954
We should be celebrating the
breast.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.707
Vaginas have always gotten their
due credit, as they should.

09:18.841 --> 09:21.259
Past 15 years have been great
for asses.

09:21.377 --> 09:24.463
But what about the breast?
It's been a little forgotten.

09:24.630 --> 09:28.216
I intend on bringing back the
golden age of the breast.

09:28.351 --> 09:30.519
Even breasts like Jenny's
deserve some respect.

09:30.636 --> 09:32.521
What's wrong with my boobs?
Kevin loves these boobs.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.606
Yeah, I have to.
Who's with me?

09:34.724 --> 09:38.026
That's the spirit, Pete!
Here you go, Kevin.

09:38.144 --> 09:41.563
No, no... There we go. Yes!
Please, open up your wallets and

09:41.697 --> 09:43.949
your bras and donate.
Wait, you're the one who has

09:44.067 --> 09:45.707
all the money.
Well, as a charity, I'm not

09:45.818 --> 09:48.236
gonna use my own money.
You know what? Enough.

09:48.371 --> 09:49.871
I actually have a legitimate
problem.

09:49.989 --> 09:52.040
You guys were right about this
whole Asian thing.

09:52.158 --> 09:54.159
Everyone at the office has
started, like, whispering, like,

09:54.327 --> 09:57.162
"Oh, Pete's got an Asian thing."
Which sucks, 'cause I actually

09:57.296 --> 10:00.882
really like Amy. I don't want her to think
I have a fetish. You can't go Asian

10:01.000 --> 10:04.002
back-to-back. You have to have a buffer
in there. That's kind of brilliant,

10:04.170 --> 10:05.637
actually.
So, basically, I need to have a

10:05.755 --> 10:08.840
full relationship with someone
non-Asian by Friday, break up

10:09.008 --> 10:10.509
with her and then I'm clear for
Amy.

10:10.643 --> 10:11.927
Where are you gonna find
someone by Friday?

10:12.061 --> 10:17.816
Oh, I got somebody in mind. Amy...
Looking forward to Friday. Me, too.

10:20.236 --> 10:21.903
Hey, Shauna.
Hi, Pete.

10:22.021 --> 10:26.992
You know, I was thinking. You and
I should go out sometime. Yeah.

10:27.110 --> 10:29.861
Yeah, yes, we could.
Any-any time you want, yes.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.036
Great, how about tonight?
I'll just need to, um, run

10:32.198 --> 10:34.533
home and turn off my Crock-Pot.
Unless you want to have

10:34.667 --> 10:37.202
Crock-Pot meatballs.
No, you know what? Never mind.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.204
My house is too dirty to have
people in.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.590
Oh, you're blowing it.
Shauna, what are you doing?

10:41.707 --> 10:43.125
Forget tonight.
Why don't we just go right now?

10:43.259 --> 10:44.459
We just go to, like, a happy
hour or something?

10:44.594 --> 10:45.877
Yes.
Let's go now.

10:46.045 --> 10:47.285
All right, let me get my jacket.

10:47.380 --> 10:51.299
Get your jacket.
I'll see you really soon.

10:51.434 --> 10:55.554
It's not great, but it's okay.

10:55.721 --> 10:59.191
Let's just get in here, get Ellie... And
12 cupcakes. ...and get out of here.

10:59.308 --> 11:03.361
I just want to go home. Wait... were
you supposed to bake something? Eh.

11:03.479 --> 11:05.030
I never do, though.
No one notices.

11:05.148 --> 11:07.732
Okay.
What is Taco doing here?

11:07.867 --> 11:10.235
I have no idea.
Just want you to know,

11:10.369 --> 11:12.404
ladies, I am very aware of your
breasts.

11:12.572 --> 11:14.906
Taco Cares, okay?
Breasts?

11:15.074 --> 11:17.159
What are you doing?
This is a school.

11:17.293 --> 11:18.960
Yeah, it's important.
I'm leaving behind some Breast

11:19.078 --> 11:21.997
Awareness Month literature.
Did you guys know that one in

11:22.131 --> 11:24.583
three nipples goes to bed
unfondled?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.801
What is all this?
These?

11:26.919 --> 11:29.087
These are sad nipples.
Is that Mom?

11:29.255 --> 11:30.889
Yeah, yeah, that's Mom in the
'60s.

11:31.007 --> 11:33.425
Her breasts looked great back
then, until you ruined 'em.

11:33.593 --> 11:36.811
<i> We</i> ruined Mom's breasts. We.
This is Andre's Aunt Kiki.

11:36.929 --> 11:38.813
She was a boat model.
Very large.

11:38.931 --> 11:40.398
Who's that?
That's my neighbor Russ.

11:40.516 --> 11:43.485
He's really out of shape.
Now, guys, would you like to

11:43.603 --> 11:46.188
take part in our Sponsor a
Breast Program?

11:46.322 --> 11:49.774
For only 30 cents a day, you can
sponsor a pair of Third World

11:49.942 --> 11:51.826
titties.
Your money's gonna go towards a

11:51.944 --> 11:54.529
bra and every month you get a
photograph of your breasts to

11:54.664 --> 11:57.165
see how they're doing.
No. No.

11:57.283 --> 11:59.501
You guys are really not
charitable people whatsoever.

11:59.619 --> 12:03.788
But you...
Those breasts need my awareness.

12:03.956 --> 12:06.958
I'll be right back.
They're gonna kick us out.

12:07.093 --> 12:08.426
Yeah.
Mom.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.011
Hey.
Where are the cookies?

12:10.129 --> 12:11.930
You didn't tell me I was
supposed to make any.

12:12.048 --> 12:14.299
It's a bake sale.
It's implied.

12:14.467 --> 12:17.636
Oh, man. Cheryl.
She is gonna totally ream me for

12:17.803 --> 12:20.855
not baking anything. Will you just...
Well, you should've baked something.

12:20.973 --> 12:22.493
It's a bake sale.
Just go cover for me.

12:22.558 --> 12:24.226
No, I don't want...
Ah, the MacArthurs.

12:24.360 --> 12:27.195
Hello, Cheryl.
Well, I see that you've come

12:27.313 --> 12:32.651
empty-handed again. No, I... I have...
I brought my charm. Can't sell that.

12:32.818 --> 12:38.123
Cheryl, hi. What's that you said about
showing up empty-handed? Oh. Oh...

12:38.241 --> 12:42.127
Oh, my... when... when were
you diagnosed?

12:42.245 --> 12:43.912
What?
I knew it!

12:44.046 --> 12:48.967
You do have cancer!
And that is why I just

12:49.085 --> 12:52.170
couldn't bake the cookies.
Of course.

12:52.338 --> 12:56.508
There's actually someone that I would
really love for you to meet. Uh, Pam?

12:56.642 --> 13:01.179
Pam! Pam... Hi. Hi. This is Pam.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.431
She's Cindy's mom.
She has cancer, too.

13:03.566 --> 13:04.899
That's right.
Oh, my God.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.685
I'd love you to join us.
I have a support group that's

13:06.819 --> 13:08.653
starting up in just a few
minutes in the choir room and

13:08.771 --> 13:10.772
they say sharing is the best
medicine.

13:10.906 --> 13:12.274
I would think medicine would
be the best medicine.

13:12.408 --> 13:16.494
No. Like radiation and chemo and removal
and... Well, those are helpful, but

13:16.612 --> 13:18.530
not entirely the best.
No, not like sharing.

13:18.698 --> 13:23.251
No. Honestly, my prognosis is very good.
I feel great, I...

13:23.369 --> 13:25.086
If-if you're too weak to
bake, you-you probably need our

13:25.204 --> 13:27.756
help.
We have to take Ellie home.

13:27.873 --> 13:31.126
Yes. This has been very tough on her.
While you're with Pam, I can

13:31.260 --> 13:32.877
just take her to the children's
support group.

13:33.045 --> 13:36.381
That's right, my daughter Cindy's in
there, so you can be with her. Thank you.

13:36.549 --> 13:40.802
You're welcome. Let's-let's learn about
the three pillars of coping. Ah...

13:40.936 --> 13:42.554
So why don't we head that way?

13:42.722 --> 13:44.389
Give me one minute.
You take your time.

13:44.523 --> 13:46.057
Thanks.
Oh, great, great, great.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.393
Great, thank you.
Oh, my God.

13:48.527 --> 13:51.563
You are lying to our daughter
that you have cancer to get out

13:51.731 --> 13:53.865
of baking cookies.
I will tell her the truth

13:53.983 --> 13:57.736
after the bake sale is over.
She is going to be thrilled it

13:57.903 --> 14:02.073
was just a little pink lie.
We're going to the seventh

14:02.241 --> 14:04.576
layer of hell.
I thought I lost you two.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.495
Oh, no, no, no.
I gotta get you to come.

14:07.630 --> 14:10.131
We have a terrific guest
speaker, so come on.

14:10.249 --> 14:13.468
Let's go.
Oh...

14:14.897 --> 14:16.593
Boy, you really enjoyed those
wings, huh?

14:16.713 --> 14:18.047
Yeah.
I love little buffalos.

14:18.215 --> 14:20.093
You can have mine if you
want. Just go ahead.

14:20.213 --> 14:22.097
Oh, we can take 'em, wrap 'em
up, put 'em in my purse.

14:22.215 --> 14:24.383
We can eat 'em for breakfast.
You know what?

14:24.517 --> 14:26.018
I'm gonna take some pictures of
us.

14:26.136 --> 14:28.888
All right. Let's get some
close-ups, here. Okay.

14:29.022 --> 14:31.557
All right.
Look at us, like a real couple.

14:31.725 --> 14:34.393
Okay. Okay, all right, good.

14:34.527 --> 14:36.779
Let's get this going here.
Whoa, you're posting it to

14:36.897 --> 14:38.614
Facebook?
Yeah, I'm gonna put it on

14:38.732 --> 14:40.366
Twitter, I'm gonna put it on
Facebook, I'm gonna put it on

14:40.483 --> 14:43.452
Vine.
All right, what do you think?

14:43.570 --> 14:45.905
Should we be... Shpete?
Or what about Pauna?

14:46.072 --> 14:47.456
We have a couple's name already?

14:47.574 --> 14:49.124
Yeah. Come on.
Okay!

14:49.242 --> 14:50.826
Let's get a good one... let's
get a good one right now.

14:50.961 --> 14:52.244
Okay, a good one.
Yeah.

14:52.412 --> 14:56.548
Oh, wow, that buffalo sauce is
really strong.

14:56.666 --> 14:59.218
Yeah, it's real strong.

14:59.336 --> 15:05.307
Oh, look at this. Well, well, well,
what do we have here? Oh, Shpete.

15:05.425 --> 15:10.145
So cute.

15:10.263 --> 15:13.849
Salami vice.
You're such a good girl.

15:13.984 --> 15:16.268
Hungry?
Ooh, watch those fingers, girl.

15:16.403 --> 15:18.354
Yeah.
So regal.

15:18.488 --> 15:21.240
Ooh, excuse me.

15:21.358 --> 15:23.325
Huh.
Not Asian.

15:23.443 --> 15:25.661
He is really plowing his way
through that office.

15:25.779 --> 15:28.447
Welcome, everybody.
I'm glad to see you here.

15:28.581 --> 15:31.784
Let me introduce to you the
chairman and CEO of Taco Corp,

15:31.952 --> 15:34.703
and its charitable foundation
Taco Cares, Mr. Taco MacArthur.

15:34.838 --> 15:36.705
What?
What?

15:36.840 --> 15:39.291
Thank you. Thank you.

15:39.459 --> 15:43.295
I love the bandanas.
I am also a Guns N' Roses fan.

15:43.430 --> 15:46.849
"Hello!
My name is 'Take-o.'"

15:46.967 --> 15:51.103
It's very nice to meet you all.
Breasts are beautiful things.

15:51.221 --> 15:53.472
But all too often, they go
unnoticed.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.108
Like the homeless guy in the
street we walk right by on our

15:56.226 --> 15:57.943
way to the vagina.
No. No, please.

15:58.061 --> 16:01.530
Yeah.
Now, the breast has four parts.

16:01.648 --> 16:07.152
The magma, the firm part, the
squishy part, and then the soft

16:07.320 --> 16:09.154
part.
Before we get into the fun

16:09.289 --> 16:12.074
stuff, I do have to talk about a
subject that's a little

16:12.208 --> 16:15.127
uncomfortable: breast hygiene.
What?

16:15.245 --> 16:17.496
Nobody wants a dirty titty.
No. No, Taco.

16:17.664 --> 16:23.552
Oh, my God. You got to shine them titties
up with baking soda and buttermilk.

16:23.670 --> 16:25.087
I'm sorry...
You just mix...

16:25.221 --> 16:27.172
This... I don't understand
what this has to do with breast

16:27.307 --> 16:28.924
cancer.
Nothing to do with cancer.

16:29.059 --> 16:31.143
Why is everyone so obsessed with
cancer?

16:31.261 --> 16:34.013
Because this is a breast
cancer support group, and you do

16:34.180 --> 16:35.848
work for breast cancer
awareness.

16:36.016 --> 16:38.100
No, no, no, no.
I never said cancer.

16:38.234 --> 16:41.904
Do not put words in my mouth.
I am here to teach women the

16:42.022 --> 16:45.524
importance of their breasts.
To tell them how special their

16:45.658 --> 16:49.528
breasts are. Women like Jenny here,
who wasn't given much. What?

16:49.662 --> 16:53.499
What? But she does so well with those
tiny little bee stings. How dare you?!

16:53.616 --> 16:56.502
She has clearly had a radical
double mastectomy.

16:56.619 --> 16:59.204
The fact that you haven't had
breast reconstruction and that

16:59.372 --> 17:02.674
you walk around looking like
that... so courageous.

17:02.792 --> 17:04.710
Good for you. Good for you.
What?

17:04.844 --> 17:08.763
It's beautiful. And let's hear it for
her husband, who's here supporting her.

17:08.882 --> 17:11.599
And he teaches us a very
valuable lesson: that he can

17:11.718 --> 17:16.055
still light up, get active for
what is just a wasteland.

17:16.189 --> 17:17.638
But he can grease it...
Thank you.

17:17.773 --> 17:19.391
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, Pam!

17:19.526 --> 17:24.980
What?! Okay, this is no barren wasteland.
This is a beautiful wonderland

17:25.115 --> 17:28.117
that he loves exploring.
They're not bad. I like them.

17:28.233 --> 17:30.536
Now, that is the breast
awareness spirit.

17:30.653 --> 17:35.240
Here you go.
Do you even have cancer?

17:35.408 --> 17:39.578
Um... funny thing.
Um... no.

17:39.746 --> 17:42.081
Oh...
The thing is, I am a

17:42.215 --> 17:46.335
distracted, overextended mother,
and I didn't want to bake any

17:46.469 --> 17:48.470
flipping cookies.
Okay, excuse my monster wife.

17:48.588 --> 17:50.722
Okay? I am so sorry about
your cancer.

17:50.840 --> 17:53.258
If it makes a difference, I
actually might have testicular

17:53.426 --> 17:55.094
cancer. I might.
He might have cancer...

17:55.228 --> 17:57.763
No. This is our month.
Your month is April!

17:57.931 --> 17:59.431
You need to go.
Let's go. Let's go.

17:59.566 --> 18:00.983
Great idea. Let's go.
Thank you so much.

18:01.101 --> 18:02.422
Good-bye.
The cookies were lovely.

18:02.485 --> 18:06.105
Hope to see you guys. That's right,
ladies, it's your month!

18:07.863 --> 18:10.048
Hey, Shauna.
Oh, hi, Pete.

18:10.168 --> 18:12.409
So, listen, I want to say,
this has been a very important

18:12.550 --> 18:15.969
relationship to me. Ugh, wish
I could say the same. What?

18:16.087 --> 18:18.005
I don't think we should see
each other anymore.

18:18.172 --> 18:20.974
Wait, are you... are you
breaking up with me?

18:21.092 --> 18:23.560
I feel like I saw kind of
everything you are.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.395
There's really not much going
on.

18:25.513 --> 18:28.232
You know when you go to a pool
at a hotel and you're like, "Oh,

18:28.349 --> 18:31.318
yeah, this pool's sexy"?
 Then you get in, you

18:31.436 --> 18:33.737
realize the whole thing is just
two feet.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.356
You can't dive anywhere.
And it's kind of dirty.

18:36.491 --> 18:39.571
Think I get it. Everyone's, like, suntan
lotion is floating on it. It's gross.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.861
You know what? Okay.
Good talk.

18:40.995 --> 18:46.366
You're just like, "Ugh, I don't
want to get that in my mouth!" Hey.

18:46.501 --> 18:48.702
Hey, Amy.
You ready for our date tonight?

18:48.870 --> 18:51.121
What up, Pete?
Hey, Tyree. Uh, one second.

18:51.256 --> 18:53.576
I'm just gonna finish up here.
Actually, I just needed Miss

18:53.591 --> 18:55.926
- Amy for a minute.
- Hey.

18:56.044 --> 18:58.929
So, uh, we good for tomorrow?
Yeah. I can't wait.

18:59.047 --> 19:01.715
All right, baby.
See you then.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.968
Later, man.
Bye, Tyree.

19:05.103 --> 19:07.771
W-Wait, you're going out with
me on Friday night and then

19:07.889 --> 19:09.773
you're going out with him on
Saturday night?

19:09.891 --> 19:11.775
What's going on?
So, my ex-boyfriend was

19:11.893 --> 19:14.728
black, and Tyree is...
: black.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.480
Yeah, I noticed that.
And so I wanted to sandwich

19:16.614 --> 19:18.398
you in between so people don't
think that I only date black

19:18.533 --> 19:21.568
dudes, you know?
So you have a black thing.

19:21.736 --> 19:25.105
Oh, yeah.
Big-time.

19:25.239 --> 19:28.458
I got to say, I am honored
and humbled that you asked me to

19:28.576 --> 19:29.960
do this.
I feel like it brings our

19:30.078 --> 19:32.359
friendship to a whole new level.
Me, too. An all-time low.

19:32.380 --> 19:33.797
You know, fine.
I'm not gonna do it.

19:33.915 --> 19:35.048
It was a favor...
Okay, all right, all right.

19:35.166 --> 19:38.001
Andre, would you please examine
my testicles?

19:38.136 --> 19:40.387
Fine. Let me just kind of
explain what I'll be doing here

19:40.505 --> 19:43.590
today. I'll be taking my hand... Uh-huh.
...and I'll be going under

19:43.725 --> 19:47.094
your shaft, around your scrotum,
and I'm gonna be massaging...

19:47.261 --> 19:51.348
Massaging? Yes. I will be getting from
the back, kind of rubbing up forward.

19:51.482 --> 19:53.723
All right, I just want you to
check to see if something's

19:53.735 --> 19:55.268
wrong please.
All right.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.271
And here we go.
Getting close.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.023
And that's me.
That's me.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.658
Okay. All right.
And that's you. Hi.

20:01.776 --> 20:05.112
I know. Just look right into my eyes here.
I will not... I will not look

20:05.279 --> 20:07.039
into your eyes.
This trade we made was great,

20:07.115 --> 20:08.782
and I'm excited about that.
Am I right, buddy? Come on.

20:08.950 --> 20:11.118
Ow. Andre, please.
There you go, there you go.

20:11.285 --> 20:13.420
Easy, easy, easy, easy, easy,
easy!

20:13.538 --> 20:15.455
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:15.623 --> 20:18.125
Oh! Ow!
It's my dick hand.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.127
It's gotten more powerful.
Why would you use your dick

20:20.294 --> 20:23.130
hand? Why wouldn't you use your ball hand?
I don't know. I was too busy

20:23.297 --> 20:25.215
trying to make eye contact with
you, and I just got lost in the

20:25.350 --> 20:26.590
moment!
Why are you using such a

20:26.634 --> 20:28.685
tight grip on your dick anyway?
Well, if you have to know,

20:28.803 --> 20:30.854
Trixie had a very tight lady
purse, and I just...

20:30.972 --> 20:32.689
Oh, no, no, no.
No. No, thank you.

20:32.807 --> 20:34.487
No, thank you.
I just need to re-create the

20:34.559 --> 20:37.477
feeling, that's all. I mean, look,
it's not a weird thing. Oh, God.

20:37.612 --> 20:39.029
You know, just... it's a
little extra pressure.

20:39.147 --> 20:41.031
Look, we're still on for that
trade, am I right?

20:41.149 --> 20:43.483
Fine, just... ow!
Oh, God!

20:43.618 --> 20:45.786
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

20:45.903 --> 20:49.790
I'm so sorry!
Forget this happened.

20:49.907 --> 20:53.126
I'm a monster.

20:53.244 --> 20:55.796
Mr. MacArthur, what a
pleasant surprise.

20:55.913 --> 20:58.498
Dr. Mike, thank you so much for
seeing me.

20:58.666 --> 21:00.717
Uh-huh.
You know, your appointment

21:00.835 --> 21:03.053
wasn't until next week.
I know, but I-I need you to

21:03.171 --> 21:04.805
look at my balls.
You need me to look at your

21:04.922 --> 21:06.423
balls?
Yes. I've been spending a lot

21:06.557 --> 21:09.059
of time down there recently, and
something is not right, you

21:09.177 --> 21:10.927
know?
One feels like an egg and one

21:11.062 --> 21:12.896
feels like a little grape.
Uh-huh. A grape?

21:13.014 --> 21:15.065
All I know is I haven't been
able to put my gel on for the

21:15.183 --> 21:17.851
last five days.
I cannot tell you enough

21:18.019 --> 21:20.687
times, you're not supposed to
put gel down there, sir.

21:20.855 --> 21:22.489
Please, you have to take a
look at it.

21:22.607 --> 21:23.824
All right. All right.
Okay.

21:23.941 --> 21:25.742
Let's take a look.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.996
No! No, no, no!
No, I... I can't.

21:30.114 --> 21:31.998
I-I can't, I can't, I can't.
I can't do that.

21:32.116 --> 21:34.476
What's wrong, Mr. MacArthur?
Did you just remember I'm a gay

21:34.585 --> 21:35.702
doctor?
No. No, no.

21:35.837 --> 21:37.838
Just, my buddy grabbed my balls
too tight.

21:37.955 --> 21:40.757
Just squeezed them.
Okay. I think I see what's

21:40.875 --> 21:42.626
going on here.
Oh, God, what is it?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.511
You're confused.
What?

21:44.629 --> 21:47.964
You're having a crisis in
regards to your sexuality.

21:48.099 --> 21:50.050
Me?
I mean, you come in here, you

21:50.218 --> 21:53.186
have your stereotypically limp
wrist, you have your pink

21:53.304 --> 21:55.639
accessories.
No. No, no, no.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.691
You wanted me to touch your
balls, and then you didn't want

21:57.809 --> 22:00.360
me to touch your balls.
You want a gay urologist, but

22:00.478 --> 22:03.113
you're also afraid of having a
gay urologist, because what if

22:03.231 --> 22:04.981
you like it?
No, I'm not gay.

22:05.116 --> 22:09.069
I'm married and have two kids.
Your wife... does she have a

22:09.203 --> 22:12.372
boyishly athletic figure?
Does everyone say she's one of

22:12.490 --> 22:15.709
the guys?
Sh... yes. Maybe.

22:15.827 --> 22:17.711
And your male friends... are
you close to them?

22:17.829 --> 22:20.611
Some might say too close?

22:20.985 --> 22:21.908
No...

22:22.871 --> 22:25.890
Will you please please please
just look at my balls?

22:26.010 --> 22:27.792
Just put your hand back down there

22:27.912 --> 22:29.663
and get grabbing, feel around...

22:30.387 --> 22:32.470
Kevin, it's not going to work out with us.

22:32.590 --> 22:33.930
It's too complicated.

22:34.179 --> 22:37.223
But I want you to explore,
spread your wings.

22:41.030 --> 22:43.791
What do you expect I would discover,
except that I've got ball cancer?
