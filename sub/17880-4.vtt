00:08.654 --> 00:09.703
There's Linda.

00:09.825 --> 00:12.056
Things have been a little awkward
since we kissed

00:12.091 --> 00:14.428
and I told her I couldn't
be with her.

00:14.463 --> 00:16.751
Actually, the kiss was
a bit awkward, too,

00:16.786 --> 00:17.936
and clanky.

00:22.609 --> 00:23.990
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:25.052 --> 00:28.840
Listen, I hope things are okay with us,
since we're not gonna,

00:28.875 --> 00:30.525
you know, be together.

00:30.741 --> 00:32.969
You mean you're not getting
on the elevator?

00:33.004 --> 00:34.705
You know what I mean.

00:34.942 --> 00:36.626
It just can't happen for us right now.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.515
But I think you are a great person, and
I know you are gonna find someone-

00:39.550 --> 00:41.650
Ted, this is my boyfriend Don.

00:42.041 --> 00:43.041
Hey.

00:45.066 --> 00:46.671
Well, that was fast.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.389
Hey, it's nice to meet you, Ted.

00:49.424 --> 00:52.074
And you're right.
Linda is a great person.

00:56.651 --> 00:58.553
Ted, we didn't go anywhere.

00:58.682 --> 01:00.201
This is the same floor.

01:00.236 --> 01:01.711
I know. I like this one.

01:06.424 --> 01:10.674
Lem, you ever get the feeling the ooplasm
cultures are looking up at you,

01:10.840 --> 01:13.140
worshipping you like a vengeful god?

01:13.435 --> 01:14.435
No.

01:14.665 --> 01:18.365
Cytoplasm cultures sometimes,
but never ooplasm.

01:18.435 --> 01:21.385
Sometimes you are a complete
stranger to me.

01:22.074 --> 01:24.763
Coffee? I think there's still some
of the fancy stuff the company

01:24.798 --> 01:27.634
- got us for Christmas instead of bonuses.
- You mean got you for Christmas.

01:27.669 --> 01:30.111
Because you were too scared to tell them
they left you off the guest list.

01:30.146 --> 01:32.349
Look, I don't need any coffee.

01:32.384 --> 01:35.047
And I知 sorry I知 not
the alpha male you are.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.210
Ooplasm.

01:46.576 --> 01:47.741
That's crazy.

01:55.075 --> 01:57.740
Did you put hydrochloric acid in this mug?

01:57.775 --> 01:59.678
Oh, yeah. I was trying to get the stains out.

01:59.713 --> 02:00.901
You know, soap would work,

02:00.936 --> 02:03.651
and it wouldn't kill someone if
they accidentally drank it.

02:03.686 --> 02:05.500
But soap leaves a film.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.154
Hello?

02:18.961 --> 02:20.515
Motion sensors.

02:21.702 --> 02:23.202
I'm motioning.

02:24.646 --> 02:26.146
I'm motioning.

02:26.967 --> 02:28.767
Please sense me.

02:46.295 --> 02:48.213
It tastes like cinnamon, hazelnut

02:48.248 --> 02:50.966
and just a hint of hydrochloric acid.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.252
It gets dark whenever you leave the room.

02:53.287 --> 02:54.290
Oh...

02:55.076 --> 02:58.385
Now how can I stay mad at you
when you say things like that?

03:05.726 --> 03:08.224
Who's that incredibly handsome guy
with gidget over there?

03:08.259 --> 03:10.745
Uh, that's Don, Linda's formerly ex,

03:10.884 --> 03:12.806
currently current boyfriend.

03:13.253 --> 03:15.760
- You're still hung up on her, aren't you?
- No, I知 not.

03:15.795 --> 03:17.870
I'm the one that didn't want
to get involved.

03:17.905 --> 03:20.429
I can't, because my daughter
really likes her, and

03:20.464 --> 03:23.358
Linda talks about taking off one day,
and that's exactly what Rose's mom did,

03:23.393 --> 03:25.279
- so I can't run the risk of that happening-
- Stop.

03:25.314 --> 03:28.314
I need to be out of this conversation
by tomorrow.

03:28.453 --> 03:29.817
Oh, uh, one other thing.

03:29.852 --> 03:33.720
Lem mentioned that there's, uh, something weird
going on with the motion sensors in the lab.

03:33.755 --> 03:36.197
Oh, yeah, we replaced all
the sensors in the building

03:36.232 --> 03:38.883
with a new, state-of-the-art system
that's gonna save money.

03:38.918 --> 03:41.769
It works by detecting light
reflected off the skin.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.441
Well, Lem says it doesn't work at all.

03:43.476 --> 03:45.226
Lem's wrong. It does work.

03:45.385 --> 03:48.877
Although there is a problem.
It doesn't seem to see black people.

03:49.590 --> 03:52.840
- Because that's what they like to eat.
- Fine.

04:01.271 --> 04:02.981
The system doesn't see black people?

04:03.016 --> 04:04.680
I know. Weird, huh?

04:04.715 --> 04:08.115
That's more than weird, Veronica.
That's basically, well...

04:08.204 --> 04:10.021
- Racist.
- The company's position is

04:10.056 --> 04:12.138
that it's actually the opposite of racist,

04:12.173 --> 04:15.229
because it's not targeting black people,
it's just ignoring them.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.548
They insist the worst people
can call it is "indifferent".

04:18.583 --> 04:21.298
Well, they know it has to be fixed, right?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.215
Please... at least say they know that.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.612
Of course they do, and
they're working on it.

04:25.647 --> 04:28.208
In the meantime, they'd like to remind
everyone to celebrate the fact

04:28.243 --> 04:32.176
that it does see Hispanics, Asians,
pacific islanders and Jews.

04:39.396 --> 04:41.329
Oh, great, she saw me looking at her.

04:41.364 --> 04:44.414
Now she's gonna think I知
hung up on her, which I知 not.

04:48.576 --> 04:50.764
Oh, man, she saw me doing it again.

04:50.799 --> 04:54.712
Now I have to go over there and
show her I知 cool with her and

04:54.747 --> 04:55.747
Don.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.043
I'm not gonna play racquetball
with you. You'll win.

04:58.078 --> 05:00.649
- Not if you distract me.
- I'm not flashing you again.

05:00.684 --> 05:04.835
That was a onetime deal because I forgot
to get you a birthday present.

05:04.870 --> 05:07.491
Oh, Ted, you remember Don,
my boyfriend.

05:07.526 --> 05:10.241
Of course. You hold a hell
of an elevator door.

05:10.276 --> 05:12.061
There's a lot more to him than that, Ted.

05:12.139 --> 05:14.538
He's funny, smart, speaks French.

05:14.572 --> 05:16.509
Say something in French, Don.

05:16.544 --> 05:17.620
<i>Non.</i>

05:18.382 --> 05:22.139
That was French and funny in one syllable,
which makes it smart.

05:22.174 --> 05:24.633
Do you wanna play racquetball with him?
He'll kick your ass.

05:24.668 --> 05:27.875
You play? Because I just got back into town,
and I don't have a partner.

05:27.910 --> 05:29.449
Except in bed.

05:30.133 --> 05:31.173
Go on.

05:32.071 --> 05:35.601
- I mean, I don't want you to feel like you have to...
- No! No, no, I値l play.

05:35.636 --> 05:37.300
<i>J'adore le racquetball...</i>

05:37.587 --> 05:38.587
<i>Don.</i>

05:45.608 --> 05:48.074
So we got the children's hospital
all set up and running.

05:48.109 --> 05:50.763
I left Liberia and went to Paris.

05:50.798 --> 05:53.805
Uh, Linda and I went there the
first time we were together.

05:53.840 --> 05:57.135
We found this vendor who makes
the most amazing chocolate crepes.

05:57.170 --> 06:00.534
She loved them so much, I got the recipe so
I could make 'em for her when we got back home...

06:00.569 --> 06:03.254
<i>It turned out Don was
really a good guy.</i>

06:03.289 --> 06:05.807
<i>Linda was right.
He was funny and smart.</i>

06:05.842 --> 06:10.429
<i>And for some reason, he could name
every freshwater fish in North America.</i>

06:10.464 --> 06:13.372
Plus, he once played miniature
golf with Tiger Woods.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.753
Good morning, Lem.
You're here bright and early.

06:25.788 --> 06:27.290
No, I was here all night.

06:27.325 --> 06:29.290
Really? Sweet.

06:29.325 --> 06:32.642
You single guys... wish I could spend
all night in the lab.

06:32.677 --> 06:34.868
I wasn't in the lab all night
because I知 single.

06:34.903 --> 06:37.854
I was stuck here because I知 black
and the door wouldn't open for me.

06:37.889 --> 06:40.063
What? Why didn't you call security?

06:40.098 --> 06:41.933
I did. Spoke to Lamont-
Nice guy.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.932
He spent the night trapped in his kiosk.

06:43.967 --> 06:46.906
This is ridiculous. You have
to talk to Veronica.

06:47.004 --> 06:49.341
- I'm going to.
- No, I mean you really have to.

06:49.376 --> 06:50.466
I'm going to.

06:50.501 --> 06:52.823
- No, you won't.
- Yes, I might.

06:53.398 --> 06:55.657
You have to stand up
for yourself this time.

06:55.692 --> 06:59.771
This isn't just delicious flavored coffee.
It is your dignity we're talking about.

06:59.806 --> 07:03.456
I have my dignity. Now will you please
take me to the bathroom?

07:06.495 --> 07:08.445
All right, I see your point.

07:08.823 --> 07:12.317
Guess I could get a couple of the black employees,
and we could go talk to Veronica.

07:12.352 --> 07:14.614
Good idea. Safety in numbers.

07:14.649 --> 07:15.684
She is...

07:15.903 --> 07:18.785
way too attractive and
intimidating to face alone.

07:18.820 --> 07:22.066
Plus, if I get enough guys, maybe
she won't know which one's me.

07:27.491 --> 07:28.624
Nothing.

07:29.961 --> 07:32.103
We never should've let
that white guy off.

07:32.138 --> 07:34.022
We're eight black men in an elevator.

07:34.057 --> 07:36.706
Of course the white guy's gonna get off.

07:37.861 --> 07:39.523
<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

07:40.022 --> 07:41.528
<i>Diversity.</i>

07:41.725 --> 07:44.925
<i>Just the thought of it makes
these white people smile.</i>

07:45.237 --> 07:49.097
<i>We believe everyone works best
when they work together,</i>

07:49.383 --> 07:52.195
<i>even if they're just standing around.</i>

07:52.407 --> 07:55.082
<i>Just like we enjoy varieties of foods,</i>

07:55.117 --> 07:57.756
<i>we enjoy varieties of people,</i>

07:57.792 --> 08:00.136
<i>even though we can't eat them.</i>

08:00.438 --> 08:04.654
<i>At Veridian Dynamics, we're committed
to a multiethnic workplace.</i>

08:04.689 --> 08:06.842
<i>You can shake on it...</i>

<i>Veridian Dynamics.</i>

08:10.327 --> 08:11.551
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Diversity.</i>

08:11.752 --> 08:13.153
<i>Veridian Dynamics.
Diversity. Good for us.</i>

08:19.581 --> 08:21.881
I had a really good time
with Don last night.

08:21.916 --> 08:23.166
Yeah, I heard.

08:23.261 --> 08:24.647
Great news.

08:24.682 --> 08:26.990
And he is obviously crazy about you.

08:27.025 --> 08:29.267
He's obviously crazy about you, too.
Good job, Ted.

08:29.302 --> 08:30.702
Everybody loves everybody.

08:31.104 --> 08:32.871
Wait. I-I知 saying I like Don.

08:32.907 --> 08:35.518
And I知 saying fantastic.

08:36.351 --> 08:38.061
It doesn't sound like
you're saying, "fantastic. "

08:38.096 --> 08:40.933
I mean, you're using the word,
but it sounds all...

08:40.967 --> 08:42.025
yell-y?

08:46.362 --> 08:48.648
- Oh. Is that one of Don's crepes?
- Yeah,

08:48.683 --> 08:50.033
they're really, really good.

08:50.179 --> 08:52.579
I'd love to taste it.

08:52.977 --> 08:54.742
Sorry. That was the last bite.

09:00.153 --> 09:03.602
This was the company's plan.
We're gonna die in here.

09:03.637 --> 09:06.265
Yeah, we'll get the last laugh next week
when everyone is wondering

09:06.300 --> 09:08.050
what that smell is.

09:11.469 --> 09:14.178
I thought you guys might
need a little help.

09:20.867 --> 09:21.867
Veronica?

09:22.790 --> 09:24.535
Oh, god. This looks way too aggressive.

09:24.570 --> 09:27.870
No, it's okay. I think I know
why you're all here.

09:28.143 --> 09:29.531
Well, most of you.

09:32.689 --> 09:34.573
Um, I have something prepared. Um...

09:36.048 --> 09:38.469
"Veronica, you are a terrific Boss. "

09:38.659 --> 09:40.410
Thank you, Lem, I値l take it from here.

09:40.445 --> 09:43.329
Let me start by apologizing
on behalf of Veridian for this

09:43.364 --> 09:45.114
inexcusable situation.

09:45.192 --> 09:46.794
I understand what you're going through.

09:46.899 --> 09:50.131
I know what it's like to see
the ugly face of discrimination.

09:50.186 --> 09:52.632
- You do?
- Yes, I do.

09:55.792 --> 09:57.490
When I was 16,

09:57.525 --> 09:58.771
I was 5'9"

09:59.044 --> 10:00.184
and stunning.

10:00.219 --> 10:02.309
I mean, off-the-charts gorgeous.

10:02.344 --> 10:05.894
At school, I was like a swan
among ugly ducklings.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.173
All the other girls hated me, and...

10:08.453 --> 10:10.531
like our light sensors are doing to you,

10:10.566 --> 10:12.153
totally ignored me.

10:12.311 --> 10:15.302
If it wasn't for the modeling contracts
and the comfort of college boys,

10:15.337 --> 10:17.033
I don't know if I would've made it.

10:17.433 --> 10:18.433
Wow.

10:19.107 --> 10:20.662
Wow, I had no idea.

10:21.351 --> 10:22.740
No, how could you?

10:22.774 --> 10:24.431
You're still not 5'9".

10:25.754 --> 10:26.763
Thank you.

10:27.143 --> 10:28.509
My point is,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.747
the company is committed
to fixing this problem,

10:31.782 --> 10:33.082
and they will.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.552
Anything else?

10:38.558 --> 10:42.475
"Great boss... always fair...
hair like spun gold... " No, that's it.

10:42.980 --> 10:45.771
Well, my door is always open to you.

10:45.806 --> 10:47.480
Please close it on the way out.

10:55.430 --> 10:57.436
I laid into Veronica pretty good.

10:57.471 --> 11:00.439
I figured it was my only shot,
so I took the gloves off.

11:00.474 --> 11:02.346
Well, that sounds great,
Lem. Sounds like you

11:02.347 --> 11:04.055
gave the company a
really strong message.

11:04.090 --> 11:04.922
Oh, yeah.

11:04.957 --> 11:08.924
She said they're working 24/7
to make things right.

11:12.892 --> 11:16.239
Manual Drinking Fountain

11:19.495 --> 11:22.799
- Separate drinking fountains?
- Thank god we don't have a company bus.

11:22.834 --> 11:24.661
Okay, they realize it didn't work.

11:24.696 --> 11:27.973
Although there's a lot of fighting upstairs
about whether it was the idea

11:28.008 --> 11:29.409
or the execution.

11:29.444 --> 11:31.818
- Look, Veronica.
- Yes, Lem?

11:32.494 --> 11:34.274
- I think we know
what I'm going to say.

11:34.275 --> 11:36.445
- No! Go ahead. You tell
her, Lem. You earned it.

11:36.880 --> 11:39.390
I am really angry about this.
Or just angry.

11:39.425 --> 11:41.289
You know, whatever feels right to you.

11:41.324 --> 11:43.449
You have every right to be angry.

11:43.484 --> 11:46.531
The good news is, I'm told
they've fixed it.

11:46.566 --> 11:49.463
- Really?
- Yes. You won. Nice work.

11:49.498 --> 11:51.591
You can walk away tall.

11:52.631 --> 11:53.781
Thank you.

11:53.912 --> 11:56.797
- I just...
- Walk... away... tall.

11:56.832 --> 11:58.393
I think she's telling you to walk away,

11:58.427 --> 11:59.756
but tall.

12:00.286 --> 12:01.286
Oh. Right.

12:02.016 --> 12:03.587
Go, Veridian!

12:07.277 --> 12:09.727
Look at you, letting him be heard.

12:10.492 --> 12:13.607
Sometimes it's important to listen
to the people who work for you, Ted.

12:13.840 --> 12:16.202
Someone just told me the
most incredible thing.

12:16.237 --> 12:17.737
Oh, god. Another one.

12:18.350 --> 12:21.509
Okay, this isn't a joke.
Eight black guys walk into an elevator...

12:21.544 --> 12:23.883
We know.
It's being handled.

12:23.918 --> 12:25.901
Whoa, excuse me.

12:25.936 --> 12:27.816
Maybe if Don were
telling you this, you'd

12:27.817 --> 12:29.874
let him finish and then
go out for smoothies.

12:33.356 --> 12:35.896
That chick gets weirder every day.

12:35.931 --> 12:37.466
I don't know what
happened. She's been mad

12:37.467 --> 12:39.286
at me ever since I told
her I liked her boyfriend.

12:39.321 --> 12:41.731
I guess I should go talk to them about
the drinking fountains,

12:41.766 --> 12:44.120
although they're not gonna want
to pull them out too fast

12:44.155 --> 12:46.555
because it'll look like they're admitting
they made a mistake.

12:46.590 --> 12:49.403
The thing is, it was Linda's idea for me
to date Don in the first place.

12:49.438 --> 12:51.062
So seriously, what the hell?

12:51.097 --> 12:52.288
Okay.

12:52.323 --> 12:53.635
She set you up, hoping you would have

12:53.636 --> 12:55.089
a bad time because you're not over her.

12:55.124 --> 12:58.420
But you had a good time, so now she's
mad because it means you are over her.

12:58.455 --> 12:59.455
Got it?

13:00.058 --> 13:02.505
That's weird. Linda and I haven't had sex.
It's complicated.

13:02.540 --> 13:05.163
You and I had sex that one time,
and it's no big deal.

13:05.198 --> 13:08.433
Well, I'm different than other women, Ted.
And by "different",

13:08.468 --> 13:09.918
I mean "better".

13:14.907 --> 13:15.907
Hey...

13:16.419 --> 13:19.653
- Look at that. The lights are on.
- Yes, they are, Phil.

13:19.688 --> 13:22.614
See? Got them to fix it.

13:22.649 --> 13:25.600
When you stand up for yourself,
you get things done.

13:25.635 --> 13:29.474
I learned that the first time I sent back
undercooked chicken at a restaurant.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.788
Yes, I ended up paying
for two chickens,

13:31.823 --> 13:34.592
- but still...
- They didn't fix the system.

13:34.627 --> 13:36.528
Sure they did. The lights were on when
I got here, so...

13:36.529 --> 13:38.170
All they did was hire a bunch of

13:38.205 --> 13:42.305
minimum-wage white guys to follow
the black employees around...

13:42.656 --> 13:44.556
And activate things for us.

13:46.685 --> 13:47.799
This is Stu.

13:48.055 --> 13:49.274
He's a huge idiot

13:49.309 --> 13:53.759
But he was born with the god-given talent
to trigger a light sensor, so...

13:54.136 --> 13:55.205
Here we are.

13:56.755 --> 13:59.675
- This tastes salty!
- Well, that's because it's salt...

13:59.710 --> 14:01.436
You huge idiot.

14:01.471 --> 14:02.731
What is it?

14:02.766 --> 14:03.766
Salt.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.010
Salt.

14:05.319 --> 14:07.805
- Salt!
- Okay, you know what? You have to do something,

14:08.691 --> 14:11.429
because I don't care for all this yelling.

14:11.464 --> 14:13.252
It's time for me and the guys
to ride again.

14:13.287 --> 14:14.787
Stu, we're leaving.

14:16.839 --> 14:18.889
I think this might be salt!

14:24.160 --> 14:26.782
You really shouldn't eat things in here.

14:51.014 --> 14:52.132
Okay, what are you doing?

14:52.167 --> 14:54.397
I was told to do exactly what you do.

14:54.432 --> 14:58.015
They didn't mean that. That doesn't even make
any sense. What they meant... okay, cut it out.

14:58.050 --> 15:01.163
Can't risk it, bro. This is the first job
I've had in, like,

15:01.198 --> 15:02.259
two years?

15:09.813 --> 15:11.599
Can you believe this?

15:11.634 --> 15:13.370
I know, isn't it great?

15:13.793 --> 15:15.887
We all get our own free
white guys.

15:15.922 --> 15:17.440
- You like it?
- Yeah!

15:17.958 --> 15:19.411
Hey, Todd's the best.

15:19.446 --> 15:22.922
He anticipates everything I need.
Plus, he picked up my dry cleaning.

15:22.957 --> 15:24.715
Oh, and he got this kink out of my neck.

15:25.004 --> 15:26.004
Really?

15:27.632 --> 15:29.421
My white guy sucks.

15:29.456 --> 15:31.378
Well, maybe you're just
not using yours right.

15:31.413 --> 15:34.613
- Yeah, maybe it's on you, dude.
- Shut up, Stu.

15:35.927 --> 15:37.977
I got the worst black guy.

15:44.102 --> 15:46.070
I can't be friends with Don anymore.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.739
Really?

15:50.177 --> 15:51.177
Go on.

15:51.212 --> 15:53.584
In fact, I never want to see him again.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.997
I'm surprised to hear you say that since
you said he was such a great guy.

15:57.111 --> 16:00.061
I know, and he is.
But it turns out, I hate him.

16:00.777 --> 16:01.802
Do you really?

16:01.837 --> 16:02.837
Yes.

16:02.876 --> 16:05.640
I want to crush his handsome skull
with a hammer.

16:05.675 --> 16:07.141
Well, that's horrible.

16:08.628 --> 16:09.718
Anything else?

16:09.988 --> 16:11.604
Well, then I'd chop him into pieces and

16:11.639 --> 16:15.065
I'd feed him to all his precious
North American freshwater fish.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.644
- Then, with whatever's leftover, I...
- Okay, easy, Ted. I am dating the guy.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.200
Right.

16:21.373 --> 16:22.773
So I should get going.

16:26.680 --> 16:27.980
Good-bye, Linda.

16:32.411 --> 16:35.211
You know, we have a meeting
now in the conference room.

16:36.296 --> 16:37.392
Oh, yeah.

16:40.392 --> 16:41.661
I'll walk with you.

16:49.355 --> 16:52.416
This whole black thing has turned
into a complete nightmare.

16:52.451 --> 16:55.239
Really? There's a problem with operation
white shadow?

16:55.274 --> 16:58.543
Human resources says it's against the law
to just hire a bunch of white people

16:58.578 --> 17:00.270
because that's discrimination.

17:00.305 --> 17:04.329
So now we also have to hire black people to
follow our black people around,

17:04.365 --> 17:07.670
which doesn't make any sense because
our system won't see them, either.

17:07.704 --> 17:11.540
So then we'd have to hire more white
people for those black people,

17:11.575 --> 17:15.430
which we can't do without hiring
more black people.

17:15.464 --> 17:19.863
Oh, Ted, I'm having the most
awful, awful, awful day.

17:20.755 --> 17:21.867
So am I.

17:26.974 --> 17:30.575
And suddenly the day takes
an unexpected turn.

17:31.785 --> 17:33.319
Not that I'm complaining.

17:37.755 --> 17:39.591
<i>I had a terrible day,</i>

17:39.695 --> 17:41.700
<i>but things were finally
starting to look up.</i>

17:41.735 --> 17:42.961
Ted, wait.

17:44.325 --> 17:46.475
I don't think this is a good idea.

17:46.705 --> 17:48.942
You couldn't have mentioned
that a couple seconds ago?

17:49.285 --> 17:50.440
I'm sorry.

17:50.645 --> 17:52.680
If we did this, it would be fun.

17:52.715 --> 17:54.500
I mean, it always is with me.

17:54.535 --> 17:58.410
I'm not bragging. It just is.
Plus, you and I are good together.

17:58.445 --> 18:01.270
But the thing is, you wouldn't
be doing it with me.

18:01.305 --> 18:03.035
Oh, come on, Linda!

18:03.765 --> 18:05.864
Okay, I see what you're saying.

18:06.895 --> 18:08.375
Listen, you're not...

18:08.445 --> 18:09.445
you know...

18:09.645 --> 18:10.645
What, Ted?

18:11.015 --> 18:13.125
Embarrassed? Upset? Disappointed?

18:13.255 --> 18:15.460
Itchy? Hungry? Earning
twice your salary?

18:15.495 --> 18:17.759
Don't worry.
I'm not any of those things.

18:17.794 --> 18:19.230
Maybe a little hungry.

18:19.265 --> 18:20.880
Plus, the salary thing.

18:20.915 --> 18:24.115
Now let's talk about the problems of
institutional racism.

18:25.335 --> 18:28.080
Boy, when the moment's gone with you,
it's really gone.

18:28.115 --> 18:29.650
I've been doing some reading.

18:29.685 --> 18:31.640
We're on the wrong side of this issue.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.950
Well, why don't they just get rid of
the new system

18:33.985 --> 18:37.670
- and put the old one back in?
- It'd be too expensive. Ted...

18:37.705 --> 18:40.129
This isn't about race.
It's about money.

18:40.164 --> 18:41.700
It's always about money.

18:41.735 --> 18:44.350
"Money before people. "
That's the company motto...

18:44.385 --> 18:47.300
Engraved right there on
the lobby floor.

18:47.335 --> 18:50.343
It just looks more heroic in Latin.

18:59.545 --> 19:02.520
<i>It turned out Lem had also been thinking about the money issue,</i>

19:02.555 --> 19:05.889
<i>and he put together some interesting
numbers to show us.</i>

19:08.075 --> 19:10.409
<i>And then we all went to speak
to management</i>

19:10.410 --> 19:12.090
<i>in a language they could understand.</i>

19:12.125 --> 19:15.910
Within a margin of error of plus
or minus 1%.

19:15.945 --> 19:17.820
And so if the company

19:17.855 --> 19:19.980
keeps hiring white people
to follow black people

19:20.015 --> 19:22.610
to follow white people to follow
black people, by...

19:22.645 --> 19:25.250
Thursday, June 27, 2013...

19:25.285 --> 19:28.568
Every person on earth will be
working for us.

19:29.305 --> 19:32.105
And... we don't have
the parking for that.

19:32.535 --> 19:33.950
- No way.
- Now...

19:33.985 --> 19:37.370
let's take a look at how this would
affect health care costs.

19:37.405 --> 19:39.651
Gee, Ted, it seems like, financially,

19:39.686 --> 19:43.026
it makes more sense to just go back
to the old system.

19:44.205 --> 19:45.800
Great idea, Veronica.

19:45.835 --> 19:48.885
That's why you're earning
twice my salary.

19:52.715 --> 19:55.390
<i>And so the company reinstalled the old
motion detectors,</i>

19:55.425 --> 19:57.047
<i>and things got back to normal.</i>

19:57.048 --> 19:57.940
See?

19:57.975 --> 20:01.550
You stood up for yourself, and finally,
the problem got solved.

20:01.585 --> 20:03.919
- Good for you, Lem.
- Thank you.

20:03.954 --> 20:08.576
I'm really gonna enjoy living my life without
having white people hovering around me.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.684
Veridian to black people:
We see you!

20:20.245 --> 20:22.920
- We're a good team, Ted.
- Yeah, we are.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.620
Here. I bought you some briefs.

20:24.655 --> 20:27.392
The boxers you were wearing
didn't highlight your assets.

20:27.605 --> 20:28.920
Penisly speaking.

20:28.955 --> 20:32.910
Thank you. And I promise to never tear off
my clothes in front of you again.

20:32.945 --> 20:34.220
I didn't say "never".

20:34.255 --> 20:36.443
I'll just let you know when you're ready.

20:36.965 --> 20:38.908
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Ted.

20:39.236 --> 20:40.236
Don.

20:40.295 --> 20:43.280
- Don stopped by for lunch.
- You guys want join us?

20:43.315 --> 20:46.615
Thanks. No, I, I've got some
briefs to look over.

20:47.045 --> 20:48.046
Veronica?

20:48.336 --> 20:49.894
Well, that was a lovely invitation.

20:50.185 --> 20:52.435
Now you can walk away tall.

20:53.785 --> 20:54.935
Walk away...

20:55.065 --> 20:56.171
Tall.

20:56.725 --> 20:58.842
Walkin' away tall, Boss.

20:59.044 --> 21:02.377
