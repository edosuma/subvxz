01:51.551 --> 01:53.591
When?

01:53.678 --> 01:55.007
Today.

01:59.518 --> 02:01.925
Get me Eric Rayburn, NSA.

02:10.779 --> 02:13.566
I wish Nicole could have come.
She loves it out here.

02:13.657 --> 02:15.733
Yeah.

02:16.993 --> 02:19.449
What do you wanna do tonight?

02:19.538 --> 02:22.111
I don't know. Get a movie?

02:22.207 --> 02:25.327
You came all this way to watch a video?

02:33.427 --> 02:35.668
How's your mom?

02:35.762 --> 02:37.470
Who knows?

02:37.556 --> 02:43.392
She puts on a happy face for everyone,
but I know she's hurtin'.

02:43.478 --> 02:46.396
Yeah.

02:47.858 --> 02:50.431
OK. Copy that.

02:50.527 --> 02:54.738
- What is it, Rosser?
- There's a situation, Mr. President.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.950
OK, try and find me!

03:08.044 --> 03:10.500
Excuse me. What are you doing in my bed?

03:10.589 --> 03:12.665
Sh. I'm hiding from Daddy.

03:12.757 --> 03:14.133
What?

03:14.217 --> 03:16.755
- Oh, hi.
- Hey, Kim.

03:17.804 --> 03:21.505
You haven't seen Megan around, have you?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.766
- What does she look like?
- Big wart on the tip of her nose.

03:24.853 --> 03:27.261
- I do not!
- There you are.

03:27.355 --> 03:29.763
Now I'm gonna get you.

03:31.985 --> 03:34.476
- Let me go!
- I'm gonna get you now.

03:34.571 --> 03:37.406
I'm going to hide again.

03:44.539 --> 03:46.746
How do you keep up with her all day?

03:46.833 --> 03:48.458
It's not easy.

04:00.806 --> 04:03.012
Dad, I'm hiding! Try to find me!

04:03.100 --> 04:05.176
Here I come!

04:17.113 --> 04:19.687
Rayburn is waiting for us.

04:19.783 --> 04:22.155
I'll see you back at the retreat.

04:22.244 --> 04:24.948
Look, son...

04:25.038 --> 04:27.873
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. It's not your fault.

04:27.958 --> 04:30.875
- I just miss hanging out with you.
- I know.

04:30.961 --> 04:33.249
We'll get there.

04:33.338 --> 04:35.461
- See you later.
- All right.

04:35.549 --> 04:38.170
I know you wanna spend time with him.
I'm sorry, sir.

04:38.260 --> 04:42.044
- How bad is the situation?
- I don't know, but I don't have a good feeling.

04:42.139 --> 04:46.432
To my knowledge, no president's
been rerouted by NSA on a morning off.

04:46.518 --> 04:48.594
Thank you.

04:58.321 --> 05:01.275
I didn't know how you liked
intel presented at impromptus,

05:01.366 --> 05:04.450
if you like it chronologically
with an alphabetical key,

05:04.536 --> 05:08.284
or if you just like
separate folders with access tabs.

05:09.291 --> 05:13.703
- I don't really care.
- I did it both ways, so you can choose.

05:14.838 --> 05:16.581
Thanks, Paula. George.

05:17.716 --> 05:20.005
- Hi, Mr. Mason.
- Yeah?

05:20.093 --> 05:23.628
I ordered upgrades on all the SIM software.
I hope you don't mind.

05:23.722 --> 05:26.474
They just went to production
and I thought you'd...

05:26.558 --> 05:28.716
Paula, stop.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.767
Right. OK. Thanks.

05:31.730 --> 05:33.105
What do you need?

05:33.190 --> 05:36.724
- Division want a meeting next month.
- For what?

05:36.818 --> 05:41.231
They wanna see our proposal
for the LAX security upgrades.

05:41.323 --> 05:45.901
Tony, if I'm still here this time next year,
take me out to the woodshed and shoot me.

05:45.994 --> 05:50.739
I should be in DC, not chasing old ladies who
set off metal detectors with knitting needles.

05:50.832 --> 05:52.410
The morning of the 15th?

05:52.751 --> 05:53.533
That's fine.

05:53.627 --> 05:56.296
- Mr. Mason.
- What?

05:56.379 --> 05:59.748
I just got off the phone
with Eric Rayburn's office at NSA.

05:59.841 --> 06:04.219
They've a request, sir.
They want you to take care of it right away.

06:07.057 --> 06:09.844
This can't be right. Eileen, get me Rayburn.

06:09.935 --> 06:11.638
I think he's up in Oregon
with the president.

06:11.655 --> 06:13.110
Put it in my office.

06:19.986 --> 06:22.062
What was that about?

06:22.155 --> 06:25.109
NSA wants us to bring in Jack Bauer.

06:25.200 --> 06:27.572
What? What for?

06:27.661 --> 06:31.824
I don't know. That's all they said.
Isn't Bauer inactive?

06:32.874 --> 06:34.950
Yeah, he's inactive.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.689
We'll have to reschedule our day.
What do we have?

07:43.779 --> 07:47.148
National Wildlife benefit at one,
a tour of the new Nike Campus,

07:47.240 --> 07:49.482
and your speech tonight.

07:49.576 --> 07:51.865
OK. Cancel what you have to,

07:51.953 --> 07:55.654
but I wanna give that speech,
announce the new clean-energy proposal.

07:55.749 --> 07:59.449
- I'm not sure you'll have time for any of that.
- Eric.

08:01.171 --> 08:03.210
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks, Jenny.

08:03.298 --> 08:08.043
- What's this about, Eric?
- We have a domestic terrorist alert.

08:08.136 --> 08:10.710
- How serious?
- Very.

08:12.099 --> 08:15.183
- Has Lynne been informed?
- She's here.

08:15.268 --> 08:16.679
Who else?

08:16.770 --> 08:22.061
Representatives from all branches
of the military, some FBI and the CIA.

08:25.362 --> 08:29.609
Mr. President, I've called Mike Novick.
He's getting on a plane right away.

08:29.699 --> 08:31.609
Good. Thank you.

08:43.212 --> 08:46.629
- Gentlemen. Lynne.
- Morning, Mr. President.

08:46.716 --> 08:50.714
What I'm about to tell you,
Mr. President, is triple-sourced.

08:50.804 --> 08:56.723
While crucial details are still unknown,
we believe this intel to have high credibility.

08:56.810 --> 08:58.470
Go on.

08:58.562 --> 09:03.188
There's a nuclear device,
under terrorist control, that's on US soil.

09:05.193 --> 09:06.771
My God!

09:07.779 --> 09:09.819
- Where?
- Los Angeles.

09:10.866 --> 09:15.029
It gets worse.
This bomb is going to go off today.

09:18.290 --> 09:20.366
How do we know this?

09:22.627 --> 09:25.462
This suicide bomber is
Mamud Rashed Faheen,

09:25.547 --> 09:32.048
a suspected terrorist who we believe has
been associated with fundamentalist groups.

09:32.137 --> 09:35.007
This is the Valentine's Day bombing
in the West Bank?

09:35.098 --> 09:40.852
This particular attack
resulted in 13 fatalities, 26 injured.

09:40.937 --> 09:43.938
We discovered that
the secondary purpose of this incident

09:44.024 --> 09:47.607
was to create the impression
Faheen was killed.

09:47.694 --> 09:50.315
- He wasn't?
- No.

09:51.448 --> 09:55.113
This was taken five days ago
at a small airport outside Léon, France.

09:55.202 --> 09:58.535
We had the man on the left,
Jason Park, under surveillance.

09:58.622 --> 10:04.126
It was just a coincidence that we caught
the very much alive Faheen in the photo.

10:04.211 --> 10:07.710
We grabbed Park and tried to extract
everything we could out of him.

10:07.798 --> 10:11.297
15 minutes ago he broke
and confessed that for the last two years

10:11.384 --> 10:14.718
Faheen has been preparing for
today's attack on Los Angeles.

10:14.805 --> 10:16.797
Why didn't you pick up Faheen?

10:16.890 --> 10:20.639
This picture wasn't analyzed
until after the two had separated.

10:20.727 --> 10:25.306
I've contacted Defense, CIA,
FBI and local jurisdictions.

10:25.398 --> 10:29.443
- Everything will be run through NSA.
- Who controls Faheen?

10:29.528 --> 10:33.442
Relatively new splinter group
that goes by the name of Second Wave.

10:33.532 --> 10:34.694
Government affiliation?

10:34.783 --> 10:38.068
Officially not recognised
by any Middle Eastern state.

10:38.161 --> 10:40.237
Unofficially?

10:53.885 --> 10:56.803
- Get me their prime minister.
- Right away.

11:24.124 --> 11:26.994
Gary, your breakfast is ready.
Don't let it get cold.

11:27.085 --> 11:29.161
I'll be right there.

11:34.342 --> 11:38.636
I won't be back till this afternoon. I'm
expecting a package. Keep an eye out for it?

11:38.722 --> 11:40.798
Sure.

11:42.017 --> 11:45.302
- Mom, I'm going skateboarding.
- And what does that mean?

11:45.395 --> 11:49.013
I know - I have to put on my helmet
and my elbow and knee pads.

11:49.107 --> 11:51.183
And stay close to Kim.

11:52.068 --> 11:53.860
- Love you.
- What about Kim?

11:53.945 --> 11:56.318
She's the best nanny ever.

11:56.406 --> 11:58.198
- You off?
- Yeah.

11:58.283 --> 12:01.818
Coffee's ready, I cut your grapefruit
and I bought some scones.

12:01.912 --> 12:04.403
- Blueberry?
- Of course.

12:19.137 --> 12:21.213
- You look good today.
- Thanks.

12:21.306 --> 12:23.382
- I'll see you tonight, OK?
- OK.

12:34.986 --> 12:38.106
You know, Kim, you've got a great body.

12:40.075 --> 12:42.151
You work out?

12:42.244 --> 12:44.735
Not really. I like to swim.

12:53.421 --> 12:54.453
Yes.

12:54.548 --> 12:57.121
I have the prime minister
on the phone for you.

12:57.217 --> 12:59.838
- Mr. Prime Minister.
- Mr. President.

12:59.928 --> 13:02.715
I was told you need to speak to me.

13:02.806 --> 13:07.183
What can you tell me about a terrorist
organisation known as Second Wave?

13:07.269 --> 13:12.511
I've heard of them, but my government
firmly rejects its tenets and its methods.

13:12.607 --> 13:16.854
In fact, we've recently arrested
several of its members.

13:16.945 --> 13:22.781
How do you account for three Second Wave
camps operating unimpeded in your country?

13:22.868 --> 13:25.489
There are no camps in my country.

13:25.579 --> 13:28.580
Mr. Prime Minister, I know two things.

13:28.665 --> 13:33.541
One: Second Wave is planning
an attack against one of my cities today.

13:34.754 --> 13:38.170
Two: your government
supports Second Wave.

13:38.258 --> 13:43.169
I would appreciate it if you would stop
using my people and my country

13:43.263 --> 13:46.513
as a source for every threat
leveled at the United States.

13:46.600 --> 13:51.392
What I'm saying is not meant to be a threat,
simply a statement of fact.

13:52.314 --> 13:56.608
If a bomb goes off on US soil today,

13:56.693 --> 14:00.144
I will have no choice but to retaliate,

14:00.238 --> 14:03.488
with immediate and decisive force,
against your government.

14:03.575 --> 14:06.280
This is an insult.

14:06.369 --> 14:09.988
We are not planning
to attack the United States.

14:10.081 --> 14:12.121
Insult or not,

14:12.209 --> 14:15.081
if you care about the
lives of your citizens,

14:15.281 --> 14:17.630
you need to hear me loud and clear.

14:18.465 --> 14:25.262
Mr. Prime Minister,
if a bomb goes off today, it will hurt us,

14:25.347 --> 14:27.838
but it will destroy you.

14:30.477 --> 14:33.229
Then, Mr. President,

14:33.313 --> 14:38.308
you will have created an enemy
of over one third of the world's population.

14:40.445 --> 14:42.901
Proceed carefully.

14:42.989 --> 14:45.065
You as well, sir.

14:57.671 --> 14:59.747
- You wanna try it again?
- Yeah.

15:01.216 --> 15:03.789
Don't fall. You can do it, though.

15:03.885 --> 15:05.961
All right. Slow...

15:34.958 --> 15:37.116
- Yeah.
- Mr. Bauer?

15:37.210 --> 15:39.962
- Who is this?
- I have George Mason from CTU on the line.

15:40.046 --> 15:42.668
- I don't work for CTU any more.
- He said that...

15:42.757 --> 15:46.292
I'm in the middle of something right now.
Thank you.

15:58.982 --> 16:01.473
I'm so proud of you. You did so good.

16:02.569 --> 16:05.523
- Is there any blood?
- Let me see.

16:05.614 --> 16:08.484
No, no blood. You're perfect.

16:09.951 --> 16:12.027
OK. I wanna go again.

16:12.120 --> 16:16.332
- All right. Let's go, tough guy.
- Hey! I'm not a guy.

16:26.218 --> 16:30.381
You know what? Why don't you go play
in the back yard. I'll meet you there.

16:30.472 --> 16:32.548
See you in a bit.

16:34.392 --> 16:36.634
Hey, sweetheart.

16:36.728 --> 16:40.311
- Dad, what are you doing here?
- I just wanted to say hi.

16:40.398 --> 16:42.771
You haven't been returning my calls.

16:42.859 --> 16:44.935
I'm sorry.

16:46.905 --> 16:49.277
I didn't come to ask you
for lunch or hang out.

16:49.366 --> 16:54.360
I know you just started this job,
but I just wanted to see you. I miss you.

16:56.373 --> 17:00.620
I know. I miss you too.

17:01.795 --> 17:04.998
- Then why won't you...
- Every time I see you, I think of Mom.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.999
- No, honey, please...
- Yes, I do.

17:07.092 --> 17:11.837
If you wanna know, I'm telling you,
it's too hard for me right now.

17:11.930 --> 17:14.884
All I ever wanted was
the three of us to be together.

17:14.974 --> 17:18.675
- It wasn't your fault. It just happened.
- Of course it was my fault.

17:18.770 --> 17:19.968
Dad.

17:20.771 --> 17:23.477
I'm so sorry, honey. I'm so sorry.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.186
I love you.

17:28.864 --> 17:32.197
I'm just... still not ready yet.

17:36.913 --> 17:39.914
- Then when?
- I don't know.

17:40.000 --> 17:43.333
Hey, Kim. Come on.

17:44.921 --> 17:46.997
- I gotta go.
- Yeah.

18:25.462 --> 18:29.507
- Come in, Eric.
- Mr. President, you wanted to see me.

18:29.591 --> 18:33.505
Yes. This report seems to be
missing a casualty assessment.

18:33.595 --> 18:38.886
I'm having those figures compiled right now.
They'll be ready in about 10 minutes.

18:38.975 --> 18:42.309
- Thank you, Eric.
- Mr. President, if I may...

18:43.355 --> 18:46.938
I think you need to have a serious
conversation with the Pentagon.

18:47.025 --> 18:49.599
They need to know how to proceed.

18:49.694 --> 18:52.945
It's too early to discuss a response.

18:53.031 --> 18:55.949
We don't even know who to retaliate against.

18:56.034 --> 19:00.826
- You know the prime minister was lying.
- He was lying about the terrorist camps.

19:00.914 --> 19:04.579
But that doesn't mean his government
is responsible for this threat.

19:04.668 --> 19:07.419
- Mr. President, I think...
- Eric, enough.

19:08.213 --> 19:12.258
Right now, my only concern
is protecting Americans.

19:12.342 --> 19:16.885
Somewhere in Los Angeles, there is
a terrorist with his finger on the trigger.

19:16.972 --> 19:18.086
We've got to get him.

19:53.341 --> 19:56.295
- Good morning.
- Hi, sweetheart.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.634
Hey, you two! Cut it out.

20:00.724 --> 20:03.511
What? I can't kiss my own wife?

20:03.602 --> 20:07.813
She's not your wife
for at least another 10 hours.

20:07.898 --> 20:11.017
- Andre is on the phone.
- Is there a problem with the flowers?

20:11.109 --> 20:13.185
- I don't know.
- God!

20:15.197 --> 20:16.395
Whoa.

20:16.490 --> 20:18.862
- Sorry.
- So where are the tables?

20:18.950 --> 20:23.577
They're not even here yet. I don't know how
they're gonna get everything set up in time.

20:23.663 --> 20:26.154
I thought you were picking your cousin up.

20:26.249 --> 20:28.705
- I sent a car.
- Cab?

20:28.794 --> 20:31.545
No, the company car.

20:31.630 --> 20:34.334
Hey, Bob. How you doin'?

20:34.424 --> 20:37.425
- There's the groom.
- Let me get that for you.

20:37.511 --> 20:38.673
I'm fine.

20:38.762 --> 20:42.807
I told Marie I'd help her fix the fountain.
Best get to it. Luis.

20:42.891 --> 20:47.185
Dad, did you tell Reza he could use
the company car to pick up his cousin?

20:47.270 --> 20:49.596
Kate, honey, please. Not today.

20:49.689 --> 20:55.194
If it were every now and then, fine, but there's
the condo in Palm Springs, the days off...

20:55.278 --> 20:57.053
Why is it you can't trust Reza?

20:58.492 --> 21:00.569
I can't believe it's because
he's from the Middle East...

21:00.659 --> 21:04.194
Dad, please.
You brought me up better than that.

21:05.372 --> 21:08.456
I don't know. It's... something else.

21:09.209 --> 21:11.000
What?

21:16.341 --> 21:21.336
I don't know. Maybe I'm just having
a hard time letting go of my little sister.

21:28.937 --> 21:31.855
I do miss your mother so much today.

21:33.692 --> 21:36.183
She'd be so proud of both of you.

21:47.831 --> 21:50.500
- Rayburn.
- Eric, it's George again.

21:50.584 --> 21:53.750
- What have you got?
- Not a lot. Haven't reached Bauer.

21:53.837 --> 21:56.791
- What's this about?
- Your office will be briefed.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.088
Just find him and bring him in.

21:59.176 --> 22:02.461
We're doing everything we can.
I don't think he wants to be found.

22:02.554 --> 22:05.638
In his condition, I don't think
he'll be worth a damn anyway.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.808
I'm not asking for your opinion.
I need this guy now.

22:08.894 --> 22:13.271
I refuse to believe that given your resources
you can't bring in one former agent.

22:13.356 --> 22:17.105
I'll tell you how you can get hold of Bauer,
but you're not gonna like it.

22:17.194 --> 22:21.820
- I'm listening.
- You're with the president right now, correct?

22:23.200 --> 22:25.572
Yeah, I am.

22:43.845 --> 22:47.428
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

22:47.516 --> 22:51.015
Hi, Jack. It's Tony Almeida at CTU.

22:51.103 --> 22:55.681
I've left messages for you everywhere.
Could you please give us a call?

22:55.774 --> 22:57.850
It's very important.

24:34.372 --> 24:37.208
This is Jack Bauer.
Leave your message after the beep.

24:37.292 --> 24:41.753
Hello, Mr. Bauer.
I'm calling on behalf of President Palmer.

24:41.838 --> 24:45.966
The president needs to speak to you
on an urgent matter. Please call us back...

24:46.051 --> 24:50.262
- Hello?
- Mr. Bauer? Please hold for the president.

24:50.347 --> 24:52.256
Sir, I have Jack Bauer.

24:52.349 --> 24:54.638
- Jack?
- Mr. President.

24:54.726 --> 24:57.478
You've been avoiding
CTU's calls this morning.

24:57.562 --> 25:00.896
- I don't work for them any more, sir.
- So I hear.

25:02.651 --> 25:04.809
How's it all going, Jack?

25:04.903 --> 25:08.023
- It's been difficult, sir.
- I'm sure it has.

25:09.407 --> 25:14.615
- I've thought a lot about you this past year.
- Thank you, Mr. President.

25:15.539 --> 25:17.911
I know this is a bad time,
but I need your help.

25:17.999 --> 25:22.211
I've been inactive for over a year.
I can't see how I'd be of any help to anyone.

25:22.295 --> 25:25.499
We are in a grave situation
that requires the attention

25:25.590 --> 25:28.591
of all branches of our national security.

25:28.677 --> 25:33.173
My advisors are convinced that you can
play an important part in this effort.

25:33.265 --> 25:37.428
- I'm sorry, but I'm in no condition...
- Jack, listen to me.

25:38.562 --> 25:41.536
I know you suffered a
loss, I know it's hard,

25:41.736 --> 25:44.102
but this is not a routine request.

25:44.192 --> 25:45.355
Go to CTU,

25:45.444 --> 25:49.607
listen to what's happening,
and then make your decision.

25:52.951 --> 25:55.027
Jack...

25:57.581 --> 25:59.739
You saved my life.

26:00.709 --> 26:05.584
I trust you as much as I trust anyone,
and now I need your help.

26:08.091 --> 26:10.214
When do they need me?

26:10.302 --> 26:12.378
Now.

26:26.443 --> 26:28.768
Carla, why'd you come back?

26:28.862 --> 26:32.646
I was supposed to wrap a gift
for Gary to take to his assistant today.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.196
- I can do it.
- No. I have to do it.

26:35.285 --> 26:36.400
Why?

26:36.495 --> 26:39.661
Because Gary likes these things done
in a very specific way.

26:39.748 --> 26:42.321
It would take too long to explain it.

26:42.417 --> 26:44.077
OK.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.208
Kim...

26:48.340 --> 26:49.668
I'm sorry.

26:51.259 --> 26:54.379
Will you take Megan upstairs to play?

26:54.471 --> 26:56.298
Sure.

27:06.483 --> 27:08.855
Have you looked at your system?

27:08.944 --> 27:11.020
No. What's up?

27:11.905 --> 27:19.153
Langley issued an information flow advisory.
Whatever's going on will be inter-agency.

27:19.246 --> 27:25.498
All right. Call Lindauer and Grothy and tell
them they don't have a day off after all.

27:27.295 --> 27:31.293
And... start filtering anything
that comes in.

27:49.526 --> 27:51.602
Hey.

27:52.279 --> 27:55.398
- Something's going on, isn't it?
- We're not sure.

27:56.783 --> 27:59.072
- I could do those redundancies.
- It's OK.

27:59.161 --> 28:03.823
- I've studied the protocols.
- Paula, you're trying too hard.

28:06.835 --> 28:10.120
Just do your job.
Everything's gonna be fine.

28:10.213 --> 28:13.463
Sorry. I waited to get assigned here
for two years. I just...

28:13.550 --> 28:17.215
Heads up. I need all department heads
over here right now.

28:17.304 --> 28:19.592
We've an active priority.

28:29.024 --> 28:32.393
I just got off a conference call
with NSA and Division.

28:32.486 --> 28:35.819
It appears there's a nuclear bomb,
under terrorist control,

28:35.906 --> 28:37.317
somewhere here in Los Angeles,

28:37.396 --> 28:41.944
set to go off at some point in
the course of the day, so...

28:42.037 --> 28:43.994
From this moment on,

28:44.080 --> 28:49.537
we do not communicate with anybody
outside of our secured envelope.

28:49.628 --> 28:55.251
That means we don't call home, we don't
talk to friends, we don't call relatives.

28:55.342 --> 28:59.042
Our job is to find this device and stop it.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.296
We do not want to create panic.

29:02.891 --> 29:05.808
I know this isn't very pleasant,

29:05.894 --> 29:09.263
but this is our job, this is what we do.

29:11.441 --> 29:13.683
So let's do it.

29:15.570 --> 29:17.646
George.

29:18.698 --> 29:22.696
- I still haven't been able to reach Jack.
- NSA got hold of him.

29:22.786 --> 29:28.125
Is this why they wanted him? I mean,
he's been out of play for over a year.

29:28.208 --> 29:33.712
I'm guessing it has something to do
with one of his previous covers.

29:36.299 --> 29:41.839
In this scenario, immediate loss of life would
be in the low thousands, relatively small.

29:41.930 --> 29:46.426
But the dispersal of radioactive debris
from a dirty bomb is unpredictable

29:46.518 --> 29:50.017
and could multiply
that figure many times over.

29:51.898 --> 29:56.525
I understand that we don't know whether
this is a dirty bomb or something bigger.

29:56.611 --> 29:59.778
Give me the worst-case scenario.

29:59.865 --> 30:02.700
All right. Worst-case scenario.

30:04.703 --> 30:07.276
Stolen Soviet nuclear warhead,

30:07.372 --> 30:12.367
a properly configured trigger
detonated 500 feet above the city.

30:12.461 --> 30:17.087
Approximately 100 square miles
would be irradiated within seconds.

30:17.591 --> 30:19.484
Apart from the loss of life,

30:19.684 --> 30:22.929
this kind of blow would
have global repercussions

30:23.013 --> 30:25.089
that would last for years.

30:27.017 --> 30:28.215
Thank you, Eric.

30:30.729 --> 30:33.498
What would you like to do
about the Joint Chiefs, sir?

30:33.598 --> 30:35.474
They're waiting to hear from you.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.643
I'm not ready to speak to them yet.

30:37.736 --> 30:42.065
Mr. President, if I could suggest
that you at least start the dialogue.

30:42.157 --> 30:45.407
At this point,
this is not a military operation.

30:45.494 --> 30:50.618
It is a potential terrorist attack,
and that's the way I'm going to approach it.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.783
Yes, sir.

30:55.796 --> 30:57.872
Thank you, everybody.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.762
Paula, I need you to open up
another socket for me.

32:28.847 --> 32:32.180
And Mason wants to see you
in the conference room.

32:35.270 --> 32:37.346
Paula?

32:50.076 --> 32:53.410
- I don't know if I can do this.
- Of course you can do it.

32:53.955 --> 32:56.928
No, I'm just a programmer and...

32:57.228 --> 32:59.709
I don't think I work very well
under this kind of pressure,

32:59.795 --> 33:03.875
so maybe they just wanna
bring somebody else in.

33:04.382 --> 33:07.917
Look, Paula, there is no one else.

33:08.011 --> 33:09.455
You're the best at what you do.

33:09.555 --> 33:12.720
You know the system inside out.
That's why you're here.

33:12.808 --> 33:15.512
Just take it one task at a time.

33:15.602 --> 33:18.638
Right now all I need you to do
is open up a couple of sockets.

33:18.730 --> 33:22.395
And then get to
the conference room, all right?

33:23.527 --> 33:25.318
OK?

33:30.617 --> 33:32.693
OK.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.376
Thank you.

34:16.538 --> 34:18.744
Hey, Jack.

34:18.831 --> 34:22.117
- Hi, Tony. How you doing?
- Fine. How you been?

34:23.420 --> 34:25.792
I've been all right. Where's George?

34:25.880 --> 34:28.335
He's waiting for you in the conference room.

34:28.425 --> 34:30.501
- You've been briefed?
- Yeah.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.061
Jack.

34:51.739 --> 34:55.820
- Jack Bauer, Michelle Dessler...
- What am I doing here, George?

34:57.704 --> 35:01.536
There's a rogue nuclear weapon
here in Los Angeles, Jack.

35:01.625 --> 35:04.329
Intel says it's going off today.

35:08.256 --> 35:10.830
- How good's your intel?
- Very.

35:10.926 --> 35:16.631
NSA have high-probability leads
on regional cells that might be involved.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.594
How close are you to IDing a prime suspect?

35:20.727 --> 35:22.554
Not close at all.

35:25.440 --> 35:27.931
That's what you're here for.

35:31.029 --> 35:33.235
Where are you going, Jack? Jack?

35:33.949 --> 35:36.191
George, let me talk to him.

35:44.167 --> 35:45.198
Jack.

35:45.293 --> 35:47.619
Just give me a second, Tony.

35:47.712 --> 35:50.548
Hello?

35:50.632 --> 35:55.377
- It's me. Listen. This is really important.
- Dad, I told you today, I'm not ready.

35:55.470 --> 35:58.590
- Kim, this is not about us.
- What's it about?

35:59.683 --> 36:02.174
I'm at CTU. They gave me some information.

36:02.269 --> 36:05.104
You and I have to leave
Los Angeles together now.

36:05.188 --> 36:09.897
No, Dad. If you're going back to work, fine,
but you're not dragging me into it.

36:09.985 --> 36:13.733
I'm not trying to get back to work.
Kim, don't hang up on me.

36:25.000 --> 36:27.325
Hi, this is Kim. Leave a message.

36:27.419 --> 36:30.870
Honey, it's me.
If you don't wanna leave with me, fine,

36:30.964 --> 36:33.455
but you've got to get out of Los Angeles.

36:33.550 --> 36:38.093
It's not safe for you here. Don't talk
to anybody. Just go to Aunt Carol's.

36:38.180 --> 36:40.237
I'm gonna call her now and
tell her that you're coming.

36:40.373 --> 36:42.411
When you get there,
phone me on my cellphone.

36:44.060 --> 36:47.809
Sweetheart, please,
just do this for me. Please.

36:50.192 --> 36:52.480
- Jack, wait a minute.
- I don't have time.

36:52.569 --> 36:55.819
You were called in
because it's a background match.

36:55.906 --> 36:58.479
You're the only one that can run with this.

36:58.575 --> 37:00.817
- I don't care.
- It's not like before.

37:00.911 --> 37:04.529
We can get to Kim, get her out of the city,
keep her safe. I promise you.

37:04.623 --> 37:07.410
The best thing you can do now
is help us find that bomb.

37:07.501 --> 37:11.285
I trusted everybody here at CTU
to protect my wife and I lost her.

37:11.379 --> 37:14.914
Tony, I'm not gonna
lose my daughter. I'm sorry.

37:15.008 --> 37:18.175
I know, Jack. I was there.

37:23.767 --> 37:27.930
Tony, look, I know you did
everything you could. I do.

37:30.107 --> 37:32.598
I just can't lose my daughter.

37:33.693 --> 37:35.982
I'm sorry.

37:49.459 --> 37:53.623
Carol, it's Jack. I wanted Kim
to get out of the city and come visit you.

37:53.713 --> 37:57.711
I'll explain as soon as I talk to you.
Could you do me a huge favour?

37:57.801 --> 38:02.379
As soon as she gets there, call me
and let me know she's safe. Thank you.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.117
Great, Almeida. Now what?

38:34.212 --> 38:38.874
- Back off, George. I did the best I could.
- I guess your best isn't very good, then.

38:38.967 --> 38:42.550
Maybe there's another way to find Wald.

38:42.637 --> 38:44.146
Why didn't I think of that?

38:44.246 --> 38:47.430
I bet NSA had us bring in a
burnt-out agent for the challenge.

38:47.517 --> 38:51.515
- Anyone could have done the job.
- Settle down, George, all right?

38:51.605 --> 38:54.724
Let's sit down, regroup
and figure out what we're gonna do.

38:54.816 --> 38:58.434
What we're gonna do?
We're gonna call NSA. Now.

38:59.529 --> 39:03.278
Here's the deal. I want Knoll or Grothy
to pick up my daughter

39:03.366 --> 39:06.202
and take her a safe distance
outside of this city.

39:06.244 --> 39:06.861
Done.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.829
I wanna be kept up to date
on their status by Tony.

39:09.915 --> 39:13.284
- Sorry, George. I don't trust you.
- You're gonna have to start.

39:13.376 --> 39:17.374
What we're up against today
none of us can walk away from.

39:17.464 --> 39:20.381
Tony and I'll both take care of Kim.

39:22.969 --> 39:25.045
I'll do it now.

39:26.681 --> 39:28.970
Thank you.

39:34.648 --> 39:37.353
Tell me about the regional cells.

39:38.902 --> 39:42.401
The most promising one's
headed by Joseph Wald.

39:42.489 --> 39:43.687
Joseph Wald?

39:43.782 --> 39:46.949
Wald's been linked to a terror group
called Second Wave.

39:47.035 --> 39:50.451
That's why it had to be you.
You put in time undercover with him.

39:50.539 --> 39:53.575
- I put him in jail, George.
- He's out on appeal.

39:53.667 --> 39:56.917
And he's actually awaiting trial
right now on new charges.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.704
- If he's convicted, he goes away for life.
- What's Wald's connection?

40:00.799 --> 40:04.844
NSA established meetings between him
and the group behind the threat.

40:04.928 --> 40:08.095
- Why didn't you pick Wald up?
- We haven't tracked him down yet.

40:08.181 --> 40:11.716
He's not at any of
the addresses in his file.

40:11.810 --> 40:15.309
Are there are key witnesses
against Wald in his upcoming trial?

40:15.397 --> 40:17.188
- There's one.
- Marshall Goren.

40:17.274 --> 40:20.856
- Apparently without him there's no case.
- Good. Bring him in.

40:20.944 --> 40:22.853
Here? What for?

40:22.946 --> 40:27.822
You want me to re-establish my cover
with Wald. It takes at least six weeks.

40:27.909 --> 40:32.820
You want me to do this in under two hours.
Where's the FBI holding Goren?

40:32.914 --> 40:35.701
Downtown, right here in protective custody.

40:35.792 --> 40:38.414
Good. Bring him in. Now.

40:50.056 --> 40:52.974
- Scott's coming to the wedding?
- Yeah. He called.

40:53.059 --> 40:55.597
I thought you knew he wouldn't come.

40:55.687 --> 41:00.349
I dated him six years ago, honey.
He's more like a brother to me.

41:01.234 --> 41:03.939
Is the groom jealous?

41:04.029 --> 41:07.065
Jealous? It's not a question of jealousy.

41:07.783 --> 41:10.534
It's a question of what
I'm comfortable with.

41:10.619 --> 41:13.952
My brothers married women that
had never been with another man.

41:14.039 --> 41:16.790
That's what my family expects of us all.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.417
Oh.

41:18.502 --> 41:23.876
I see. So, instead, they have to settle
for Marie, who's what - damaged goods?

41:23.965 --> 41:28.544
All right, don't let him bait you.
He's just trying to push our buttons.

41:28.637 --> 41:32.765
I've got this guy wrapped
around my little finger and he knows it.

41:32.849 --> 41:35.340
Kate. Teléfono.

41:39.981 --> 41:42.188
I'll show you the seating chart.

41:42.275 --> 41:44.564
Thanks.

41:44.653 --> 41:48.022
- Hello?
- This is Ralph Burton. Is this a bad time?

41:48.115 --> 41:50.819
No, Ralph. Can you hold on a second?

42:01.753 --> 42:04.837
Sorry, Ralph. What's up?
Didn't you get my cheque?

42:04.923 --> 42:06.916
Yes. That's not why I'm calling.

42:07.008 --> 42:09.546
When you asked for
a background on Reza Naiyeer,

42:09.636 --> 42:12.127
you were worried about
his financial integrity.

42:12.222 --> 42:17.014
The report you showed me said I had nothing
to worry about. Has something changed?

42:17.102 --> 42:20.601
Not exactly. He's done nothing wrong
at your father's company,

42:20.689 --> 42:24.817
and his financial dealings in the past
have been legitimate.

42:24.901 --> 42:26.941
Great. So what's the problem?

42:27.028 --> 42:29.946
I was proofing a file on another individual.

42:30.031 --> 42:33.447
- Reza's name came up.
- Yeah, so?

42:33.535 --> 42:37.698
There's a man named Syed Ali.
He's an international financier

42:37.789 --> 42:41.621
with ties to several
terrorist organisations.

42:41.710 --> 42:45.161
What are you saying?
Reza knows this guy Ali?

42:45.255 --> 42:48.458
Well, according to this file,
they've had dealings.

42:48.550 --> 42:49.748
Oh, my God.

42:49.843 --> 42:54.920
It's possible that Reza's business
with Ali was legitimate,

42:55.015 --> 42:58.431
that Reza didn't even know
about Ali's terrorist connection.

42:58.518 --> 43:02.979
But if you wanna know for sure,
I'm gonna need your help.

43:06.359 --> 43:09.064
What do you need me to do?

43:16.620 --> 43:21.282
Let's not waste time. I don't want
my decisions based on speculation.

43:21.374 --> 43:23.675
Before I read any of the reports,

43:23.775 --> 43:27.709
I want the sources and their
reliability double-checked.

43:28.757 --> 43:30.833
Excuse me.

43:31.843 --> 43:35.295
Did you set up a comm with the Joint Chiefs
regarding response?

43:35.388 --> 43:36.302
No.

43:36.389 --> 43:40.636
The secretary of state called. They're
expecting to speak with you in five minutes.

43:40.727 --> 43:42.636
What?

43:45.065 --> 43:47.141
- Cancel it.
- Yes, sir.

43:52.697 --> 43:54.655
Eric.

43:54.741 --> 43:56.817
Yes, Mr. President.

43:57.619 --> 44:00.110
Would you excuse us, please?

44:04.126 --> 44:08.040
I thought I was clear that we're not
to burn time and energy on response.

44:08.130 --> 44:09.956
Of course, sir.

44:11.258 --> 44:15.006
Then why is there a conference call
set up with the Joint Chiefs?

44:15.095 --> 44:18.760
In case you changed your mind.
It takes time to coordinate.

44:18.849 --> 44:21.933
Don't second-guess me, Eric.

44:22.853 --> 44:24.994
Today's gonna be a very long day,

44:25.694 --> 44:28.439
and I don't want my own
people working against me.

44:28.525 --> 44:32.439
Sir, I would never work against you.

44:41.013 --> 44:42.484
Goren's gonna be here any minute.

44:42.681 --> 44:46.824
He'll be back in your
custody within the hour.

44:46.918 --> 44:49.207
All right, George.

44:49.296 --> 44:51.237
Our pals at the FBI aren't too happy.

44:51.337 --> 44:53.625
Goren's the state's only
witness against Wald.

44:53.717 --> 44:56.587
Get what you want fast
cos I want them off my back.

44:56.678 --> 44:57.876
What's that?

44:57.971 --> 45:02.929
We're saying you were extradited to Florida
on two counts of armed robbery.

45:03.018 --> 45:06.184
Don't make it armed robbery -
that's not how they knew me.

45:06.271 --> 45:09.391
Conspiracy to transport illegal explosives.

45:09.483 --> 45:10.348
Got it.

45:10.442 --> 45:12.684
Are you gonna let me in our your plan?

45:12.778 --> 45:16.229
And get in touch
with a Rudi Collett, a parole officer.

45:16.323 --> 45:20.901
- Brief him and then put him into my cover.
- Jack.

45:21.953 --> 45:25.737
Look at you. You look like a bum
off the street, you're not talking to me.

45:25.832 --> 45:29.747
I just confiscated a witness
outside of my authority based on your call.

45:29.836 --> 45:33.585
- Are you gonna tell me what you're doing?
- No.

45:33.673 --> 45:39.427
Are you losing it? I don't have the time or
the resources to clean up your messes today.

45:39.513 --> 45:42.217
I'm not losing it.

45:48.355 --> 45:51.060
Just put him in the chair.

45:54.569 --> 45:56.645
Thank you, gentlemen.

45:58.824 --> 46:01.528
Michelle, please excuse us.

46:01.618 --> 46:04.405
- Don't you want me to...?
- No.

46:19.136 --> 46:22.505
- You are Marshall Goren?
- Yeah.

46:22.597 --> 46:26.512
Eight counts: kidnapping a minor.
Two counts: child pornography.

46:26.601 --> 46:28.927
First degree murder.

46:29.020 --> 46:32.472
Yeah. Hey, look. I already made my deal.

46:33.692 --> 46:36.064
I don't need to hear this noise.

46:36.153 --> 46:40.696
All I gotta do is testify against Wald,
and I walk.

46:56.047 --> 46:59.666
Get a helicopter and a backup team
ready to leave here in 15 minutes.

46:59.760 --> 47:02.381
- Are you out of your mind?
- You wanna find this bomb?

47:02.471 --> 47:05.341
- This is what it's gonna take.
- Killing a witness?

47:05.432 --> 47:09.132
People like you want results
but you never wanna get your hands dirty.

47:09.227 --> 47:12.347
I'd start rolling up your sleeves.

47:17.402 --> 47:19.194
I'm gonna need a hacksaw.

48:03.490 --> 48:06.610
Look, Kim. Olivia's giving
Kristen a haircut.

48:06.701 --> 48:11.031
- Olivia gave Kristen a haircut last night.
- Her hair grows really fast.

48:12.040 --> 48:16.204
Are you a complete idiot?
I had to leave in the middle of a meeting!

48:16.294 --> 48:20.837
How do you think that makes me look?
You cannot possibly be this incompetent.

48:20.924 --> 48:25.716
Can we go somewhere else?
I don't like it when he gets like this.

48:27.055 --> 48:30.009
What do you mean? What does he do?

48:30.100 --> 48:32.389
Stay there.

48:39.443 --> 48:42.230
It's gonna be fine.

48:42.988 --> 48:44.815
Megan.

48:45.824 --> 48:47.900
Sweetie.

48:49.911 --> 48:54.075
Megan, are you in there?
Open the door, sweetie. Now.

48:55.417 --> 48:57.326
Go in the bathroom.

48:57.419 --> 49:00.336
- Just a minute. We're in the bathroom.
- You're what?

49:00.422 --> 49:02.498
Be right there.

49:07.679 --> 49:11.843
Sorry. Megan's going through
a modest stage. No boys allowed.

49:14.311 --> 49:17.561
- So you guys were in the bathroom?
- Yeah.

49:21.067 --> 49:23.819
- You didn't hear anything?
- What do you mean?

49:25.739 --> 49:28.656
- Carla had a little accident. She slipped.
- Is she OK?

49:28.742 --> 49:31.363
Yeah, she's fine. Just fine.

49:35.040 --> 49:38.076
- Why don't you go give her a hand?
- Well...

49:38.168 --> 49:42.462
Listen, I need a few minutes
with my daughter before I leave, OK?

49:46.051 --> 49:48.624
- What's the matter, petal?
- We were...

49:48.720 --> 49:51.887
- Did I not tell you to get outta here?
- Mommy!

49:52.766 --> 49:55.435
- It's OK, Megan.
- Honey, I'm sorry.

49:55.519 --> 49:59.137
Daddy's had a bad... I'm sorry.
Just be quiet. Megan, shut up.

49:59.231 --> 50:01.519
- Megan, shut up!
- Leave her alone!

50:01.608 --> 50:04.313
Stay down, Kim. I will hurt you!

50:05.278 --> 50:06.654
Shut up, Megan!

50:21.044 --> 50:22.835
What? Yeah.

50:22.921 --> 50:26.456
Yes, I said I'd be back
in a couple of minutes.

50:26.550 --> 50:27.795
Yeah.

50:27.884 --> 50:30.921
Listen, I just have to
take care of something.

50:31.012 --> 50:33.634
I'll be a few minutes.
