WEBVTT

02:05.380 --> 02:07.048
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

02:08.841 --> 02:10.760
Come on, you gotta help me.
Come on.

02:12.011 --> 02:13.179
Leave.

02:14.722 --> 02:16.057
- Leave.
- Shut up, Joel.

02:16.057 --> 02:18.267
- Take the gun.
- Joel, shut the fuck up!

02:19.394 --> 02:22.772
You go. You go.
You go north.

02:22.772 --> 02:24.399
You go to Tommy.

02:26.526 --> 02:27.652
You go.

03:48.274 --> 03:49.609
Give 'em back!

03:50.109 --> 03:51.360
Then pick up your pace.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.322
I'm not running doubles again
because of your shitty attitude.

03:54.697 --> 03:56.491
I don't wanna fight about it.

03:56.491 --> 03:57.617
Fight about it?

03:57.617 --> 03:59.368
You don't fight.

03:59.368 --> 04:01.204
Your friend fights.

04:01.746 --> 04:03.956
She's not here anymore, is she?

04:42.328 --> 04:43.246
What's goin' on?

04:44.372 --> 04:45.957
You've never been
what I'd call well-behaved,

04:45.957 --> 04:47.583
but the last few weeks?

04:54.757 --> 04:56.634
Bethany started it.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.886
Well, Bethany's in the infirmary
with 15 stitches.

04:58.886 --> 05:00.096
- Good.
- Okay.

05:00.096 --> 05:01.305
Just put me in the fuckin' hole.

05:01.305 --> 05:04.308
I put you in the hole three times.
It doesn't work.

05:04.725 --> 05:07.270
- So I'm gonna try something new.
- What?

05:07.603 --> 05:09.647
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

05:10.773 --> 05:13.901
You're smart, Ellie.
You're so smart, you're stupid.

05:14.443 --> 05:15.611
You can't see where this is going?

05:15.611 --> 05:17.029
Let me help you out.

05:17.029 --> 05:18.364
Two paths ahead of you.

05:21.325 --> 05:22.285
First path.

05:22.285 --> 05:24.662
You keep acting like a grunt,
so you get the life of a grunt.

05:25.246 --> 05:27.290
Up at dawn.
Walk the streets, walk the wall.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.542
Ya eat shit food, ya do shit jobs,

05:29.542 --> 05:32.044
ya take shit orders
from your patrol leader,

05:32.044 --> 05:34.338
who'll probably be Bethany.

05:35.173 --> 05:38.134
And that'll be your life from now
until ya catch a bullet from a Firefly,

05:38.134 --> 05:39.427
or fall drunk off a roof,

05:39.427 --> 05:41.470
or get your hair caught
in a moving tank tread.

05:43.389 --> 05:44.557
There's the other path.

05:44.557 --> 05:46.976
You swallow this pride of yours.

05:46.976 --> 05:50.062
You follow the rules.
You become an officer.

05:51.147 --> 05:53.524
You get your own room.
You get a nice bed.

05:53.524 --> 05:55.693
We eat well.
We don't go on patrol.

05:55.693 --> 05:57.445
We're cool in the summer.
We're warm in the winter.

05:57.445 --> 05:59.238
And best of all,
when you're an officer,

05:59.238 --> 06:02.867
you get to tell the Bethanys of the world
exactly where to shove it.

06:06.913 --> 06:08.497
Why do you even care?

06:10.833 --> 06:14.295
I care because no matter what
anyone out there says or thinks,

06:14.295 --> 06:16.797
we're the only thing
holding this all together.

06:17.465 --> 06:20.343
If we go down, the people in the zone
will starve or murder each other.

06:20.343 --> 06:22.220
That much I know.

06:26.349 --> 06:27.683
There's a leader in you.

06:28.726 --> 06:30.645
And one day, it could be your turn.

06:31.604 --> 06:32.730
Or not.

06:35.691 --> 06:37.109
So, which way?

06:42.406 --> 06:43.324
Keys.

06:43.908 --> 06:45.034
Good.

06:49.497 --> 06:53.042
- Is that it?
- That's it.

06:56.504 --> 06:58.130
Can I have my Walkman back?

07:55.479 --> 07:57.606
Lights out, ladies!

08:00.359 --> 08:01.944
Turn 'em off!

09:03.255 --> 09:05.341
Riley! Where have you been?

09:05.341 --> 09:07.843
What the fuck is wrong with you,
sneaking up on me like that?

09:07.843 --> 09:09.387
It was a joke, okay?

09:09.387 --> 09:10.930
I thought it would work better.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.932
In my mind, you loved it.

09:16.685 --> 09:17.603
So

09:18.854 --> 09:20.398
how's it going?

09:22.108 --> 09:24.151
- Okay, it's bad.
- I thought you were dead.

09:24.151 --> 09:25.861
You've been gone for three weeks.

09:25.861 --> 09:27.780
I should fuckin' stab you.

09:27.780 --> 09:29.824
No, I appreciate your mercy.

09:35.037 --> 09:36.288
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

09:36.288 --> 09:38.332
I just ran away for a bit, that's all.

09:38.332 --> 09:40.960
If you're going through some shit,
you're supposed to, I don't know,

09:40.960 --> 09:42.670
talk to your best friend about it?

09:45.047 --> 09:46.382
I came back.

09:47.758 --> 09:50.177
- Wait, who gave you the black eye?
- Tell me where you were.

09:50.177 --> 09:51.762
Gimme a name and I'll fuck 'em up.

09:51.762 --> 09:54.432
It was Bethany
and I already fucked her up.

09:54.432 --> 09:56.058
Where were you?

10:08.904 --> 10:11.490
- I joined the Fireflies.
- Fuck you.

10:12.533 --> 10:15.453
I'm not in the mood for this, Riley.
I'm really not in the mood.

10:16.787 --> 10:19.248
- You're a Firefly?
- Jesus!

10:19.248 --> 10:20.499
I told you I'd fuckin' do it.

10:20.499 --> 10:23.335
Talking about "liberating the QZ"
is not the same as--

10:23.335 --> 10:25.421
- Fuck. Where did you even--
- Slow down, slow down.

10:25.421 --> 10:27.131
I will tell you everything.

10:27.131 --> 10:29.467
But first,
you have to promise me something.

10:29.467 --> 10:33.846
Sort of crazy, and you're gonna say no,
but then you have to say yes.

10:36.265 --> 10:39.977
Come with me for a few hours,
and have the best night of your life.

10:41.854 --> 10:42.771
No.

10:43.355 --> 10:45.524
- Okay, now say yes.
- I'm not going anywhere with you.

10:45.524 --> 10:47.485
It's-- Great.
It's 2:00 AM.

10:47.485 --> 10:51.489
And in a few hours, I have drills
where we learn to kill Fireflies.

10:52.948 --> 10:54.283
Get dressed.

10:57.203 --> 10:58.329
So stupid.

11:01.999 --> 11:04.293
- Turn around.
- You're so weird about that.

11:22.978 --> 11:24.522
If you're thinking about
hanging in the park,

11:24.522 --> 11:26.482
we can't go there anymore.

11:26.482 --> 11:28.150
There's a new patrol
that they just put in.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.986
Well, we're not going to the park.

11:31.529 --> 11:32.738
Okay.

11:32.738 --> 11:35.324
- So where are we going?
- Secret.

11:35.324 --> 11:36.534
Trust me.

11:37.201 --> 11:38.953
You trust me, right?

11:39.828 --> 11:40.955
I don't know.
Should I trust you?

11:40.955 --> 11:43.082
Of course, you should. With your life.

11:50.005 --> 11:53.717
- Guards?
- No, 'cause FEDRA's fucking stupid.

11:53.717 --> 11:56.053
- Ready?
- This better be good.

12:10.985 --> 12:13.445
Not that fuckin' stupid, are they?

12:13.445 --> 12:15.489
Okay, rocky start.

12:15.489 --> 12:17.491
Could've been worse, though.

12:17.491 --> 12:20.286
- Could've been a 7-11 situation.
- No thanks.

12:20.286 --> 12:22.830
I'd like to keep my other eyebrow
in one piece.

12:22.830 --> 12:26.166
Well, since you're so interested
in self-preservation all of a sudden,

12:26.166 --> 12:28.419
maybe you should stop
fucking with Bethany.

12:28.419 --> 12:31.630
- What's that about?
- Nothing. It's stupid.

12:32.339 --> 12:33.924
She had to get 15 stitches.

12:33.924 --> 12:35.801
Maybe you shouldn't mess
with people like that.

12:35.801 --> 12:39.430
I'm sorry.
Are you telling me not to beat people up?

12:39.430 --> 12:41.724
You put Carol in the infirmary
for a fuckin' week.

12:41.724 --> 12:45.102
I'm just saying,
you can't fight everything and everyone.

12:45.102 --> 12:46.937
You can pick and choose what's important.

12:46.937 --> 12:50.024
Oh, are they teaching you this
at Firefly University?

12:50.024 --> 12:52.067
Kinda, yeah.

12:52.776 --> 12:54.153
And fuck Carol.

12:55.154 --> 12:58.073
Fuck Carol. Fucking Carol.

12:58.782 --> 13:01.535
- Where are we going?
- Through a damn window.

13:17.134 --> 13:18.052
Wow.

13:18.802 --> 13:22.139
Look at how that water trickles down
those rusty mailboxes.

13:22.931 --> 13:24.642
This really is the best night of my life.

13:24.642 --> 13:26.268
- See?
- Yeah.

13:29.563 --> 13:31.148
Firefly lights are better.

13:31.857 --> 13:34.026
Congrats.
One point for the anarchists.

13:34.026 --> 13:36.862
- We prefer freedom fighters.
- Whatever.

13:37.446 --> 13:41.075
- How many floors?
- Like two.

13:43.035 --> 13:44.995
What the fuck?

13:44.995 --> 13:47.206
Okay, I'm sorry.

13:50.250 --> 13:53.128
- Two floors. Fuck you.
- I was a tad bit off.

13:56.298 --> 13:57.716
Oh, shit.

13:58.842 --> 14:00.886
- Is he dead?
- Yeah.

14:00.886 --> 14:03.389
- Is this the big surprise?
- No.

14:03.389 --> 14:06.016
No, this guy wasn't here yesterday.

14:21.323 --> 14:23.075
So disgusting.

14:31.208 --> 14:34.086
- Is that real?
- Bottle's real.

14:36.088 --> 14:38.882
This isn't moonshine either.
It's, like, from before.

14:39.758 --> 14:42.219
This guy must've spent every card
he had to get this.

14:42.219 --> 14:45.347
No one told him he couldn't mix pills
with that shit?

14:46.557 --> 14:48.058
I think he knew what he was doing.

14:57.025 --> 14:58.610
You're sick.
You know that, right?

14:58.610 --> 15:00.446
You laughed, too.
You're laughing.

15:00.446 --> 15:02.281
Okay, we drinkin' it or what?

15:03.240 --> 15:04.074
Yeah.

15:13.459 --> 15:15.043
- Yum.
- Gimme.

15:15.043 --> 15:16.086
Oh, okay.

15:24.678 --> 15:25.763
It's great.

15:31.810 --> 15:33.729
Was that the first dead body you ever saw?

15:34.605 --> 15:35.522
No.

15:36.648 --> 15:38.192
My parents.

15:38.817 --> 15:41.487
Yeah. Sorry. I know--
I mean, I knew that.

15:41.487 --> 15:44.490
No, it's fine. It's fine. Gimme.

15:50.162 --> 15:51.705
Can I hold your gun?

15:53.332 --> 15:55.918
They kinda made me swear

15:55.918 --> 15:57.836
not to let other people handle my sidearm.

15:57.836 --> 16:01.882
"Not to handle my sidearm
'cause I'm such a fuckin' Firefly."

16:03.801 --> 16:06.136
- Give me your gun.
- All right, fine.

16:12.893 --> 16:13.811
It's heavy.

16:14.728 --> 16:15.646
'Kay.

16:18.941 --> 16:19.858
Thank you.

16:25.113 --> 16:27.491
So, what happened?
You started dating some Firefly dude,

16:27.491 --> 16:30.160
and was like, "Oh, this is cool.
I think I'll be a terrorist."

16:30.160 --> 16:32.704
Yup. That's it.
We're getting married.

16:35.499 --> 16:37.042
But really. Why?

16:40.462 --> 16:44.466
Okay, one night, you were in the hole.

16:44.466 --> 16:46.385
I got bored, so I snuck out.

16:46.385 --> 16:49.972
I was on my way back,
being stealthy like I am.

16:49.972 --> 16:51.974
And this chick popped outta nowhere.

16:51.974 --> 16:54.643
- Chick, like our age?
- No. Like, 40.

16:55.185 --> 16:56.103
Or 50.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.564
Whatever.
Anyways, old.

16:58.564 --> 17:02.401
She said she was impressed
watching me sneak around,

17:02.401 --> 17:04.444
avoiding guards,

17:04.444 --> 17:07.447
and she asked
what I thought about FEDRA.

17:07.447 --> 17:08.866
So I told her the truth.

17:08.866 --> 17:11.201
They're fascist dickbags,
and they're the ones

17:11.201 --> 17:14.580
that should be getting hanged
for their crimes, not the people.

17:14.580 --> 17:17.249
She's like,
"All right. If you want in, you're in."

17:18.041 --> 17:20.419
That's it?
No weird initiations?

17:20.419 --> 17:23.255
Nope. I said yes,
and now I'm a Firefly.

17:23.255 --> 17:25.549
That easy to give up everything, huh?

17:25.549 --> 17:29.845
By "everything," you mean
becoming a fascist dickbag?

17:29.845 --> 17:32.890
I don't know if it's that simple.

17:32.890 --> 17:35.642
Like, in a way, FEDRA
kinda holds everything together.

17:35.642 --> 17:39.438
Ya know, as much as I love
arguing with your stubborn ass,

17:40.439 --> 17:42.065
we're on a mission here.

18:18.977 --> 18:20.604
Okay, stop, stop.

18:20.604 --> 18:23.065
- Gimme a second.
- Okay.

18:27.945 --> 18:29.154
Those lights are new.

18:29.696 --> 18:32.157
Yeah, they wired up the block
a couple weeks ago.

18:32.157 --> 18:35.369
You know, more people in the QZ,
so more apartments.

18:36.203 --> 18:37.412
So FEDRA's not entirely bad.

18:38.246 --> 18:40.499
Fascist dickbags
starving their own population.

18:41.041 --> 18:43.961
Fireflies blowing up the storage depot
didn't help.

18:43.961 --> 18:47.965
- Propaganda bullshit.
- Yeah? So you don't bomb stuff anymore?

18:47.965 --> 18:50.801
- Not when civilians are around.
- That's propaganda bullshit.

18:53.595 --> 18:56.390
- What?
- One,

18:56.390 --> 18:58.058
it's okay you don't know everything.

18:58.058 --> 18:59.393
Agree to disagree.

19:00.978 --> 19:03.313
And two, we're here.

19:10.612 --> 19:13.281
The mall?
You out of your fuckin' mind?

19:13.281 --> 19:16.326
They sealed that place off for a reason.
It's full of Infected.

19:16.326 --> 19:18.245
If it's sealed off, then,

19:18.245 --> 19:20.455
why isn't it sealed off?

19:48.191 --> 19:49.526
It's slimy.

19:49.526 --> 19:52.738
Yeah. It's been exposed for a few years.

19:52.738 --> 19:55.991
So, turns out when FEDRA
connected that block up to the grid,

19:55.991 --> 19:58.201
this place got connected, too.

19:58.201 --> 19:59.828
Not that they know.

20:01.872 --> 20:03.040
So what are we doing here?

20:03.040 --> 20:05.083
Trying to get electrocuted, or--

20:06.251 --> 20:07.711
Pay attention.

20:07.711 --> 20:10.505
You're gonna go through there,
then turn right.

20:10.505 --> 20:13.800
- You'll see a door. Go through it. Wait.
- No.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.219
Fucking turn right, open the door,

20:16.219 --> 20:17.971
tell me when you're there.

20:17.971 --> 20:19.806
- Go.
- Fine.

20:20.307 --> 20:21.558
Are you gonna kill me?

20:21.558 --> 20:23.477
This seems like a perfect place to do it.

20:23.477 --> 20:24.352
I'm aware.

20:43.580 --> 20:46.500
- Are you there?
- I'm here! Now what?

20:47.459 --> 20:50.962
You fucking piece of shit.
Come on.

21:13.110 --> 21:14.027
So

21:15.278 --> 21:16.613
what do you think?

21:17.447 --> 21:18.573
It's

21:20.492 --> 21:23.078
it's fuckin'--
Wait. The lights.

21:23.078 --> 21:25.122
We're fine.
You saw outside.

21:25.122 --> 21:26.414
It's like a big bunker.

21:26.414 --> 21:29.000
No one can see shit but us.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.085
Just me and you.

21:30.752 --> 21:33.296
And you ain't seen nothin' yet.

21:34.047 --> 21:38.176
Tonight, I'm gonna show you
the four wonders of the mall.

21:38.176 --> 21:40.303
You planned stuff?

21:47.519 --> 21:49.062
No way!

21:49.688 --> 21:51.606
Electric stairs?

21:52.149 --> 21:54.359
- Escalator.
- Escalator?

21:55.318 --> 21:57.195
Go ahead.

22:02.909 --> 22:04.035
No way!

22:05.203 --> 22:08.748
Check me out, man!
This is so cool!

22:09.499 --> 22:11.126
Look! Backwards.

22:13.336 --> 22:15.922
Forwards! And backwards!

22:15.922 --> 22:17.257
And now I'm not goin' anywhere.

22:17.966 --> 22:19.092
I'm not moving!

22:19.676 --> 22:23.096
- So this is the first wonder, right?
- Yeah, sure.

22:23.096 --> 22:25.599
There can be five wonders in this mall.

22:27.851 --> 22:30.145
Be careful!

22:32.480 --> 22:34.024
- I'm coming for you.
- What are you doing?

22:34.816 --> 22:35.775
Ooh, shit.

22:35.775 --> 22:37.944
- Jesus, Ellie.
- No, I'm good.

22:38.361 --> 22:40.906
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I just tripped.

22:41.656 --> 22:42.449
Okay.

22:42.949 --> 22:43.825
See?

22:46.828 --> 22:49.164
You are just a graceful ballerina.

22:49.164 --> 22:52.667
- But chop, chop. We're on a schedule.
- Okay.

23:10.268 --> 23:13.647
Not exactly "full of Infected," is it?

23:13.647 --> 23:15.732
Okay, you were right.

23:15.732 --> 23:17.984
Can we, like,
stop and check some of it out?

23:17.984 --> 23:20.612
Nope. Time is of the essence.

23:22.656 --> 23:25.242
Why are some of these stores empty
and some not?

23:25.242 --> 23:27.827
My mom said when the outbreak happened,

23:27.827 --> 23:30.622
people started looting
until the military shut it down,

23:30.622 --> 23:33.500
so the stuff that's gone
is the stuff that people

23:33.500 --> 23:37.128
needed the most, or wanted, I guess.

23:37.712 --> 23:41.299
Right. So, sneakers

23:41.299 --> 23:42.926
and not soap.

23:43.551 --> 23:45.095
Or that shit.

23:47.222 --> 23:50.725
I don't get why people back then
wanted all this stuff.

23:50.725 --> 23:54.354
- Do you need me to explain it to you?
- No. I know why.

23:54.354 --> 23:57.565
- It just looks uncomfortable.
- Yep.

24:00.068 --> 24:00.944
What?

24:00.944 --> 24:03.530
Nothing. I was just trying to imagine
you wearing that.

24:03.530 --> 24:04.531
Shut up.

24:07.325 --> 24:09.286
All right, come on.

24:09.286 --> 24:10.704
We're almost there.

24:22.507 --> 24:24.467
- Ellie!
- I'm on my way!

24:37.314 --> 24:38.648
Stop right here.

24:39.607 --> 24:40.567
Close your eyes.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.110
- What for?
- Close.

24:44.821 --> 24:46.906
- Do you trust me?
- With my life, apparently.

24:47.532 --> 24:48.783
Well then, give me your hand.

24:51.786 --> 24:52.662
Come on.

25:02.464 --> 25:04.215
Almost there.

25:05.967 --> 25:10.889
- Now?
- Almost. I said almost.

25:12.015 --> 25:12.932
Okay.

25:14.642 --> 25:16.394
Open your eyes.

25:24.486 --> 25:25.820
Shit.

25:37.248 --> 25:38.416
What?

25:38.416 --> 25:40.043
- No way.
- Yep.

26:15.203 --> 26:17.163
- What?
- Nothing.

26:17.163 --> 26:19.249
- You're drunk.
- No.

26:19.249 --> 26:20.792
- Yes.
- Not yet.

26:20.792 --> 26:21.793
Gimme.

26:33.179 --> 26:34.264
- Ya need help?
- No.

26:41.938 --> 26:43.189
Yeah.

27:25.356 --> 27:27.567
Come on. Damn it.

27:27.567 --> 27:29.569
Let me see if I can fix it.

27:31.237 --> 27:32.155
Wait.

27:34.657 --> 27:37.994
Did you really leave because you actually
think you could liberate this place?

27:37.994 --> 27:40.914
Don't say it like
it's some type of fantasy, Ellie.

27:40.914 --> 27:43.291
They've done it in the other QZs.

27:43.291 --> 27:46.085
Set things right,
the way they used to be.

27:46.085 --> 27:48.129
Yeah, we could do that, too.

27:49.130 --> 27:50.507
If you come back, I mean.

27:50.507 --> 27:52.926
We're, like, the future.

27:53.885 --> 27:55.929
You know, we could make things better.

27:55.929 --> 27:57.764
We could be running things.

27:58.556 --> 28:01.726
You could be running things.

28:02.519 --> 28:04.479
I turn 17 next month.

28:04.479 --> 28:06.356
That's when you get your assignment.

28:06.356 --> 28:08.358
You know what Kwong gave me?

28:11.361 --> 28:13.279
Sewage detail.

28:14.113 --> 28:15.490
Fuck.

28:15.490 --> 28:18.785
Standing guard while people shovel shit.

28:18.785 --> 28:20.787
That's what they think of me.

28:23.581 --> 28:25.917
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

28:27.669 --> 28:29.003
I don't know.

28:29.796 --> 28:32.048
I just-- I panicked.

28:32.632 --> 28:36.386
And I ran,
and the longer I was away,

28:36.386 --> 28:39.430
the harder it was for me to come back.

28:40.223 --> 28:42.141
Is that making sense?

28:43.434 --> 28:44.978
No, I get it.

28:47.021 --> 28:49.774
I would've gotten it back then, too,
ya know?

28:51.234 --> 28:55.280
You know, you're the one thing I missed
from that fucking place,

28:57.282 --> 29:00.034
if that makes a difference.

29:01.744 --> 29:02.870
No?

29:12.130 --> 29:13.381
You know what?

29:13.381 --> 29:16.342
We're two wonders down,
three more to go,

29:16.342 --> 29:17.969
if you wanna keep going.

29:17.969 --> 29:21.931
I mean, I'm on a magic horse
with, like, a million lights.

29:21.931 --> 29:23.766
I don't know
how it's supposed to get better.

29:30.106 --> 29:31.858
Is that a time machine?

29:32.817 --> 29:33.943
Come on.

29:43.036 --> 29:45.288
<i>Can you be cool like me?</i>

29:45.288 --> 29:46.914
<i>Strike your best pose.</i>

29:46.914 --> 29:49.250
<i>Hey, being cool ain't free.</i>

29:49.250 --> 29:51.753
-<i>Please insert five dollars.</i>
- Fuck you.

29:51.753 --> 29:54.464
Well, look at that.
I came prepared.

29:54.464 --> 29:55.923
Have you done this before?

29:55.923 --> 29:58.926
No, idiot.
I was waiting to do it with you.

30:04.140 --> 30:06.893
<i>- Remember, strike your coolest pose.</i>
- Let's go, bunny<i>.</i>

30:10.688 --> 30:11.773
Oh shit!

30:11.773 --> 30:12.899
What should we do?

30:13.733 --> 30:14.525
<i>Lookin' great.</i>

30:15.109 --> 30:16.361
Okay, bunny ears?

30:17.153 --> 30:18.279
- Wait.
<i>- Say "cheese."</i>

30:18.780 --> 30:19.781
<i>Find another pose.</i>

30:20.907 --> 30:22.283
- Back-to-back?
- Yeah.

30:23.993 --> 30:25.662
- Do scary, do scary.
- Okay.

30:27.747 --> 30:28.623
<i>Time's up.</i>

30:28.623 --> 30:29.874
<i>- Thanks for all your cool poses.</i>
- Okay, yeah.

30:29.874 --> 30:31.668
- Get off of me.
- Okay, okay, sorry.

30:31.668 --> 30:34.128
- I gotcha.
-<i>Your photos are almost done.</i>

30:34.128 --> 30:35.963
<i>Let's see how ya did.</i>

30:38.800 --> 30:40.927
- Oh, yeah.
-<i>Thanks for hoppin' on by.</i>

30:40.927 --> 30:42.428
There we go.

30:43.137 --> 30:44.389
Oh, fuck.

30:47.266 --> 30:48.810
That one's not bad.

30:50.228 --> 30:51.938
If you like it, it's yours.

31:01.030 --> 31:05.827
Come on. We got places to be
and wonders to see.

31:05.827 --> 31:08.496
Are we going to whatever number
we're up to?

31:08.496 --> 31:11.624
Fourth wonder of the mall,
and I hope you're prepared

31:11.624 --> 31:13.626
because it's pretty dang awesome,

31:13.626 --> 31:16.170
- and it might break you.
- Don't oversell, man.

31:20.591 --> 31:21.676
Listen.

31:32.603 --> 31:33.521
Riley?

31:34.355 --> 31:35.356
Yeah?

31:36.524 --> 31:39.068
This is the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

31:40.945 --> 31:42.697
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:02.550 --> 32:04.135
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

32:04.135 --> 32:09.140
<i>The Earth is being invaded
by flying saucers from Mars!</i>

32:09.557 --> 32:11.142
Ohh, yeah.

32:11.142 --> 32:12.685
<i>Select a racehorse.</i>

32:13.436 --> 32:14.562
Cool.

32:26.199 --> 32:27.325
Do you have any money?

32:28.910 --> 32:31.871
No, not that useless shit. Coins.

32:31.871 --> 32:34.123
We can't even play once.

32:41.214 --> 32:43.466
- You asshole.
- Yeah, I'm the same asshole

32:43.466 --> 32:47.136
that spent an hour yesterday
breaking this fucker open.

32:49.514 --> 32:50.640
Thank you.

32:58.648 --> 32:59.774
Dude.

33:01.359 --> 33:03.110
- Dude.
- Yeah.

33:04.904 --> 33:07.281
- Oh, my God.
- Ya ready?

33:07.281 --> 33:08.699
Yeah.

33:20.336 --> 33:21.420
Oh, my God.

33:24.715 --> 33:26.300
Raiden.
Fuck yeah!

33:26.759 --> 33:27.927
-<i>Mileena.</i>
- Mileena.

33:29.262 --> 33:30.513
Dead Pool.

33:30.513 --> 33:32.807
-<i>Round one. Fight.</i>
- Wait, how do I play?

33:32.807 --> 33:35.059
- Smash the buttons.
- There's so many of them.

33:39.564 --> 33:40.398
Boom.

33:40.815 --> 33:42.108
- Use the joystick more.
- Okay.

33:46.612 --> 33:48.030
Mileena wins.

33:48.030 --> 33:49.615
That is such horseshit.

33:49.615 --> 33:52.076
Flawless horseshit.
You ready?

33:52.076 --> 33:54.287
-<i>Round two. Fight.</i>
- No! I'm-- Shit.

33:54.287 --> 33:56.455
Okay. Joystick.

33:59.250 --> 34:01.335
- You're doin' so good!
- How am I doing that?

34:01.335 --> 34:02.670
<i>Finish him.</i>

34:02.670 --> 34:04.338
- Finish him!
- Do not finish me.

34:04.338 --> 34:07.174
But then you wouldn't get to see this.

34:12.054 --> 34:13.514
- Fuck!
-<i>Mileena wins.</i>

34:13.514 --> 34:15.391
-<i>Fatality.</i>
- Fatality<i>.</i>

34:15.391 --> 34:16.893
Okay, that was pretty cool.

34:16.893 --> 34:18.227
Yeah, I know.

34:18.227 --> 34:20.021
How many times have you played this?

34:20.021 --> 34:23.274
I mean, I've been here a few times.

34:24.525 --> 34:26.402
So you don't wait
to do everything with me.

34:30.615 --> 34:31.532
Go again?

34:32.575 --> 34:34.118
Goddamn right.

34:38.164 --> 34:41.250
- Ready?
- Round one. Fight.

34:42.209 --> 34:44.086
- Not for long.
- Oh shit.

34:44.086 --> 34:47.131
- You're cheating!
- I'm not cheating. You're just losing.

34:47.131 --> 34:49.091
Okay. Just for that. Boom!

34:50.092 --> 34:50.885
Boom!

34:51.636 --> 34:52.511
Here we go.

35:23.542 --> 35:25.461
That was a good punch. I can't lie.

35:26.087 --> 35:29.131
- Yeah! Gotcha.
- You are beating my ass.

35:29.924 --> 35:31.300
Jesus!

35:31.300 --> 35:33.260
- Now, what do I do? What do I do?
- Okay, back, forward,

35:33.260 --> 35:34.887
down, forward, low punch!

35:44.730 --> 35:45.606
Come on.

35:45.606 --> 35:46.983
Next thing.

35:55.825 --> 35:57.118
It's getting late.

35:57.118 --> 36:00.788
I have to wake up and make my bed soon.

36:00.788 --> 36:01.872
So.

36:03.082 --> 36:05.042
We still have a few hours left, though.

36:05.042 --> 36:07.878
Yeah, I just can't get in trouble again.

36:09.714 --> 36:12.049
But I'll meet you here tomorrow.

36:15.344 --> 36:17.263
I got you a gift.

36:20.349 --> 36:23.102
I mean, I do like gifts.

36:23.561 --> 36:24.729
- Is it a spider?
- No.

36:24.729 --> 36:26.147
- Is it a new shirt?
- No.

36:26.147 --> 36:27.523
Is it a water pistol?

36:27.523 --> 36:29.025
- Better.
- Better?

36:29.025 --> 36:30.901
- Is it a dinosaur?
- Possibly.

36:30.901 --> 36:32.903
I mean, I'll be your best friend again
if it's a dinosaur.

36:32.903 --> 36:34.405
Really, my best friend again?

36:34.405 --> 36:37.033
Ellie, you are already my best friend.

36:37.033 --> 36:38.784
Wait, wait.

36:39.285 --> 36:40.536
Is it tacos?

36:43.080 --> 36:45.833
Okay, not tacos.

36:56.969 --> 36:58.345
Is this where you've been staying?

36:58.345 --> 36:59.555
Mostly.

37:02.892 --> 37:04.727
"Volume Too."

37:04.727 --> 37:07.271
Shut up! They made a second one?

37:07.271 --> 37:09.273
Where did you get that?

37:12.026 --> 37:14.653
"What did the frustrated cannibal do?"

37:15.696 --> 37:17.782
- Lay it on me.
-"He threw up his hands."

37:19.658 --> 37:21.410
- Gimme. I wanna go. Okay.
- Okay.

37:26.874 --> 37:28.793
"What did the triangle say to the circle?"

37:30.795 --> 37:31.921
"You're so pointless."

37:33.506 --> 37:34.882
Okay.

37:34.882 --> 37:37.718
Okay, "How does a computer get drunk?"

37:37.718 --> 37:40.012
"It takes screenshots."

37:41.222 --> 37:43.307
- What are screenshots?
- I don't actually know.

37:43.307 --> 37:44.767
Okay, gimme.

37:46.644 --> 37:48.187
Give me a second.

37:53.859 --> 37:58.322
Here we go.
"What do you call an alligator in a vest?"

38:06.664 --> 38:07.873
Did you make these?

38:09.250 --> 38:11.794
Yes, Ellie, put it down.

38:12.586 --> 38:14.130
To kill soldiers?

38:18.592 --> 38:20.386
You didn't find this mall, did you?

38:20.386 --> 38:22.054
They posted you here.

38:22.054 --> 38:23.681
A new recruit guarding their stash?

38:23.681 --> 38:28.102
We would never use them on you
or anywhere ever near you.

38:28.102 --> 38:30.062
I would never let them do that.

38:30.062 --> 38:31.856
You would never let them?

38:31.856 --> 38:33.941
Right,
and you think they're gonna listen to you?

38:40.364 --> 38:42.283
I mean, I guess we'll find out.

38:42.700 --> 38:44.076
- Ellie.
- It's okay. I'm going.

38:44.076 --> 38:45.077
Ellie!

38:45.828 --> 38:46.745
Ellie?

38:48.706 --> 38:49.874
Ellie!

38:49.874 --> 38:51.417
None of this shit was even about me!

38:51.417 --> 38:53.127
- Would you stop?
- Fuck you!

38:53.127 --> 38:54.128
Ellie!

38:55.129 --> 38:57.047
Ellie, I'm leaving.

39:00.676 --> 39:04.221
They're sending me to a post
in the Atlanta QZ.

39:07.725 --> 39:12.062
I asked if you could join
so we could go together.

39:13.981 --> 39:16.150
- But Marlene said no.
- Who the fuck is Marlene?

39:16.150 --> 39:17.818
Marlene is the lady that helped me get--

39:17.818 --> 39:19.445
It doesn't matter.

39:21.780 --> 39:23.324
Ellie, I tried.

39:26.118 --> 39:28.454
Tonight's my last night in Boston.

39:48.307 --> 39:50.226
Why did you bring me here?

39:53.103 --> 39:55.022
Because I wanted to see you.

39:57.566 --> 39:58.484
And?

40:00.694 --> 40:01.820
And

40:10.704 --> 40:13.123
and I wanted to say goodbye.

40:18.420 --> 40:20.798
- This isn't easy, Ellie.
- It actually is.

40:22.007 --> 40:23.550
You just did it.

40:25.719 --> 40:27.012
Goodbye.

41:20.816 --> 41:22.234
Shit.

41:22.234 --> 41:23.610
Riley?

41:27.197 --> 41:28.324
Riley!

41:32.995 --> 41:34.705
What the fuck?

41:38.751 --> 41:40.294
Surprise.

41:44.381 --> 41:45.924
The fifth wonder.

41:47.676 --> 41:51.263
I thought you'd like this one the best,
so I saved it for last.

41:52.723 --> 41:54.641
I guess that was stupid.

41:55.100 --> 41:58.020
- I'm fucking stupid.
- Gimme the book.

42:23.754 --> 42:25.297
So you leave me.

42:26.006 --> 42:27.549
I think you're dead.

42:29.093 --> 42:31.053
All of a sudden, you're alive.

42:31.053 --> 42:33.555
And you give me this night,

42:33.555 --> 42:36.558
this amazing fucking night.

42:37.935 --> 42:39.728
And now you're leaving again.

42:39.728 --> 42:40.938
Forever.

42:41.939 --> 42:45.484
To join some cause
I don't even think you understand.

42:46.568 --> 42:47.903
Tell me I'm wrong.

42:50.864 --> 42:54.993
I think that you don't know everything.

42:58.497 --> 43:02.459
You don't know what it was like
to have a family.

43:02.459 --> 43:03.877
To belong.

43:05.003 --> 43:08.132
I didn't have them for long,
but I had them.

43:09.133 --> 43:10.884
I belonged to them.

43:11.844 --> 43:13.470
And I want that again.

43:14.888 --> 43:17.766
Maybe the Fireflies aren't
what I think they are

43:17.766 --> 43:19.977
but they chose me.

43:22.104 --> 43:23.856
I matter to them.

43:25.274 --> 43:27.401
You mattered to me first.

43:29.528 --> 43:32.072
Goddamn it, I wanna punch you so bad.

43:33.490 --> 43:35.617
If it makes you hate me less.

43:40.080 --> 43:41.999
And you're sure about this?

43:42.791 --> 43:43.959
About leaving?

43:50.549 --> 43:51.758
Yeah.

43:59.641 --> 44:00.767
Okay.

44:03.187 --> 44:06.273
And I'm not saying it all pissy and shit.

44:10.777 --> 44:12.529
You're my best friend

44:14.490 --> 44:16.241
and I'll miss you.

44:22.956 --> 44:23.916
Well

44:24.791 --> 44:26.543
night's not over yet.

44:29.087 --> 44:30.297
One last thing?

44:31.757 --> 44:32.758
Sure.

44:44.728 --> 44:45.521
Hey.

44:51.151 --> 44:53.320
What am I supposed to do with this?

44:53.320 --> 44:55.989
- Put it on, stupid.
- But why?

44:55.989 --> 44:57.616
'Cause it's fun.

44:58.617 --> 45:00.953
And this music sucks.

45:01.954 --> 45:05.123
- You little thief!
- I was definitely

45:05.916 --> 45:07.417
probably gonna give it back.

45:07.918 --> 45:08.710
Right.

45:28.480 --> 45:29.856
Really?

45:30.649 --> 45:32.276
- Come on.
- I don't--

45:32.276 --> 45:34.486
Get your ass up here.

45:45.998 --> 45:47.207
Come on.

46:03.223 --> 46:08.103
<i>I got you, babe</i>

46:36.048 --> 46:37.174
What?

46:40.052 --> 46:41.386
Don't go.

46:47.309 --> 46:48.310
Okay.

46:57.069 --> 46:58.403
I'm sorry.

47:03.158 --> 47:04.368
For what?

47:18.965 --> 47:21.093
What do we do now?

47:23.095 --> 47:24.846
We're gonna figure it out.

47:31.937 --> 47:33.480
Get ready to run.

47:38.485 --> 47:40.404
Go! Go! Go!

48:11.601 --> 48:13.228
Get the fuck off of me!

48:45.427 --> 48:47.095
Holy shit!

49:03.779 --> 49:04.696
No.

49:10.285 --> 49:12.287
No, no, no, no, no!

49:12.287 --> 49:13.705
No!

50:02.546 --> 50:05.465
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

50:12.389 --> 50:15.559
You motherfucker! Fuck you! Fuck!

50:15.559 --> 50:17.894
You mother-- Fuck!

50:24.484 --> 50:26.611
There's more stuff over there
you can break.

50:34.411 --> 50:36.162
What are we gonna do?

50:38.582 --> 50:40.917
Way I see it, we got two options.

50:42.294 --> 50:43.211
One,

50:44.170 --> 50:46.089
we take the easy way out.

50:47.382 --> 50:49.718
It's quick, painless.

50:52.596 --> 50:55.515
No, no, I don't like option one.

50:58.768 --> 51:00.312
Option two,

51:01.938 --> 51:03.857
we just keep going.

51:07.277 --> 51:10.197
What are you talking about, Riley?
It's over.

51:10.822 --> 51:14.159
It will be, but not yet.

51:15.035 --> 51:18.580
It ends this way for everyone
sooner or later, right?

51:19.664 --> 51:23.209
Some of us just get there faster
than others.

51:25.587 --> 51:27.339
But we don't quit.

51:31.384 --> 51:32.510
Whether

51:33.887 --> 51:35.805
it's two minutes

51:36.890 --> 51:38.642
or two days

51:41.186 --> 51:42.938
we don't give that up.

51:45.357 --> 51:47.108
I don't wanna give that up.

51:50.612 --> 51:54.783
We can just be all poetic and shit
and lose our minds together.

51:58.995 --> 52:00.747
What's option three?

52:04.376 --> 52:07.295
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

53:56.571 --> 53:58.448
Okay, okay.
