00:27.070 --> 00:28.071
Anyone gotten hurt?

00:28.245 --> 00:29.638
Not as far
as I can tell.

00:29.812 --> 00:31.509
Have you seen Agent Brody yet?

00:31.683 --> 00:32.858
What are we doing here?

00:33.033 --> 00:35.426
Well, he said for us
to meet him here.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.559
He needed to talk to us
about something important.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.995
Yeah, but Paige, it's a fire.

00:39.169 --> 00:40.692
So?
So we don't do fires.

00:40.866 --> 00:44.044
Firemen do fires,
we do fireballs.

00:44.218 --> 00:45.567
Look, he said
it was something connected

00:45.741 --> 00:47.525
to this new power thing
he's been talking about.

00:47.699 --> 00:50.528
Yeah, well, we're not
Brody's Angels.

00:50.702 --> 00:52.965
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's just, I'm stressed.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.663
It's my first week
back at work

00:54.837 --> 00:56.621

of catching up to do.

on the third floor.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.278

Wait. Why?

01:01.452 --> 01:02.584
Because somebody's
trapped inside,

01:02.758 --> 01:04.064
and if I'm right,
he's gonna jump

01:04.238 --> 01:05.413
and he's not
gonna get hurt.

01:05.587 --> 01:06.892
PAIGE:
How do you know?

01:07.067 --> 01:08.242
Just a hunch.

01:08.416 --> 01:10.200
Just a hunch,
huh, Agent Brody?

01:10.374 --> 01:11.114
Kyle.

01:11.288 --> 01:13.247
Whatever. Look.

01:13.421 --> 01:14.596
I don't mean
to be rude,

01:14.770 --> 01:16.946
but we don't
really know you.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.426
And I know
you were right

about the whole

Whoa.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.155
Okay, how did you
know that?
Because that's

01:52.329 --> 01:54.592
the fourth person it's
happened to in the last month.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.552
Which means if the pattern
holds, he's about to die.

01:57.726 --> 01:59.075
Pattern, what pattern?What?

01:59.249 --> 02:00.598
All right, guys,

02:00.772 --> 02:01.991
stay on the survivor.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.732
And keep recording.

02:03.906 --> 02:05.255
Copy that.

02:05.429 --> 02:07.127
God, is he talking
to that helicopter?

02:08.693 --> 02:10.434
He's really cool.

how he knew

04:28.268 --> 04:29.747
this was gonna happen.

04:29.921 --> 04:31.575
And I don't know why we
couldn't have stopped it.

04:31.749 --> 04:32.924
Stopped what?

04:33.098 --> 04:35.231
A man jumped out
of a burning building

04:35.405 --> 04:36.754
only to get hit by a truck?

04:36.928 --> 04:38.234
I mean,
what's the connection there?

04:38.408 --> 04:39.975
I'm hoping Kyle knows.

04:40.149 --> 04:42.978
Okay, you know, can we please
call him Agent Brody

04:43.152 --> 04:44.371
until we can trust him?

04:44.545 --> 04:45.807
I trust him.

04:48.897 --> 04:49.680
Are you okay?

04:49.854 --> 04:51.247
No.

04:51.421 --> 04:52.944
I wish I knew why
this keeps happening.

04:53.118 --> 04:54.598
Well, you said something
about a pattern, right?

04:54.772 --> 04:56.208
Yeah. Every time

04:56.383 --> 04:57.862
something unusual happens,
I investigate it.

04:58.036 --> 04:59.777
The more unusual it is,
the more it tends to lead me

04:59.951 --> 05:00.865
towards this new power

05:01.039 --> 05:02.171
that I was telling
you about.

05:02.345 --> 05:03.694
Does this new power have a name?

05:03.868 --> 05:05.305
I don't know yet.
You guys want to walk?

05:09.047 --> 05:10.658
So you think, uh,

05:10.832 --> 05:12.790
that whole thing is what's
killing these innocents?

05:12.964 --> 05:14.226
Well, I don't think

05:14.401 --> 05:15.445
they're literally
running them down

05:15.619 --> 05:17.055
if that's what
you're asking,

05:17.229 --> 05:18.318
but I do think that
they're doing something

05:18.492 --> 05:19.536
to cause them
to be killed.

05:19.710 --> 05:20.624
Hmm, what kind
of something?

05:20.798 --> 05:22.104
I don't know.

05:22.278 --> 05:23.758
But whatever it is,
it's got something

05:23.932 --> 05:25.194
to do with taking power.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.413
'cause that's what
they're all about.

Innocents don't
have powers.

If they did,
they wouldn't need us.

All I know is that things
this unusual

05:33.289 --> 05:35.291
don't just happen like this
over and over again.

05:35.465 --> 05:36.510

you're ready?

help save their humans,

07:23.921 --> 07:25.401
that they can
help me instead.

07:25.575 --> 07:28.622
All this just to defeat me?

07:28.796 --> 07:30.319
No. So that I can
protect myself

from the great threat
you taught us was coming.

07:32.364 --> 07:37.152

08:04.135 --> 08:06.050
Yeah, I'm positive. Why?

the only one who can save Leo.

that's what Leo needs.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.717
Yeah, but there's no guarantees
that Leo would see that.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.633
I mean, the vision quest
can take you anywhere

08:23.807 --> 08:25.200
and sometimes it can
even be dangerous.

Why would that be?

09:40.449 --> 09:41.711

09:41.885 --> 09:43.539
that your sister doesn't
trust me very much.

09:45.802 --> 09:47.804

I've saved you from getting
exposed more than once.

where isInspector Sheridan?

09:53.767 --> 09:56.334
Does it really matter?

09:56.508 --> 09:58.728
Uh, it does
if you hurt her.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.774
I'm not here
to hurt anybody, Paige.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.123
I'm here to keep them

10:02.297 --> 10:03.951
from getting hurt, remember?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.170
The fact that you know
that people may die

10:06.344 --> 10:09.043
is exactly what makes you
so suspicious, Agent Brody.

10:09.217 --> 10:10.435
Kyle.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.397
What is that?

10:15.571 --> 10:18.792
That is a bird's-eye-view
of the victim

10:18.966 --> 10:21.142
just before he
stepped off the curb.

10:21.316 --> 10:23.797
Now, we shot this with
the fastest digital
imaging equipment

10:23.971 --> 10:26.626
known to man-- or at least
Homeland Security anyway.

10:26.800 --> 10:30.107
Now, if you look at it in
normal light, it appears

10:30.281 --> 10:33.067
as though he's alone--
throw an E.M. filter on it...

10:34.764 --> 10:36.026
he's not.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.811
What are those?

10:37.985 --> 10:39.464
If I had to guess,
I'd say the light one's

10:39.639 --> 10:41.118
a protector of some kind.

10:41.292 --> 10:44.426
Protector what? Like, some sort
of guardian angel thing?

10:44.600 --> 10:46.515
Mm-hmm.
That's one way of putting it.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.258
What? You don't believe in them?

10:50.432 --> 10:51.433
You do?

10:51.607 --> 10:52.913
You've been in all the scrapes

10:53.087 --> 10:54.610
that I've slipped out of,

10:54.784 --> 10:56.743
it's the only reason
why I think I'm still alive.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.440
My guess is,

10:58.614 --> 11:01.399
that's the power
the dark figure wants.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.314
People who have

11:03.488 --> 11:05.099
especially strong protectors,

11:05.273 --> 11:06.709
it would explain why

11:06.883 --> 11:08.102
they miraculously
survive something

11:08.276 --> 11:10.931
and then,
the next moment... don't.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.241
What?

11:17.415 --> 11:20.288
Nothing. So, uh...

11:20.462 --> 11:22.464
how do we find out
if that

11:22.638 --> 11:24.727
dark figure is what
you think it is?

11:24.901 --> 11:26.294
We wait for the next fire.

11:27.599 --> 11:28.905
Interested?

11:41.439 --> 11:42.789
Nowhere else to turn.

11:44.051 --> 11:46.967
Nowhere else to go... to go.

11:47.141 --> 11:48.055
Leave me alone!

11:48.229 --> 11:49.491
Let go of all you know...

11:49.665 --> 11:51.275
all you know.

11:51.449 --> 11:54.496
Don't resist... Don't resist us.

11:54.670 --> 11:57.847
Why are you doing this to me?

11:58.021 --> 11:59.588
What do you want?

12:04.158 --> 12:06.290
Perhaps we've
pushed him too far.

12:06.464 --> 12:07.944
We have no choice.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.468
He must join us willingly.

12:10.642 --> 12:11.905
But first

12:12.079 --> 12:14.342
must see
there is no other option.

12:14.516 --> 12:16.997
His will is strong,
even for an Elder.

12:17.171 --> 12:20.652
Which is why
he's so valuable to us.

12:25.179 --> 12:27.747
What is it?

12:27.921 --> 12:29.749
There may be another way.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.576
Another opportunity to show him

12:31.751 --> 12:35.406
that one cannot
ignore the truth forever.

12:39.541 --> 12:42.370
PIPER:
Leo?

12:42.544 --> 12:45.242
Leo?

12:45.416 --> 12:46.853
You see, I know he can hear me.

12:47.027 --> 12:48.506
He just doesn't
want to come.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.247
Let me give this a try.

12:50.421 --> 12:53.163
Leo! Leo, you get your butt
down here right now

12:53.337 --> 12:55.600
or we will summon your ass!

12:59.561 --> 13:01.432
Nicely done.

13:01.606 --> 13:03.739
It's not safe for me to be here.
You know that.

13:03.913 --> 13:05.088
We'll take that risk.

13:05.262 --> 13:06.611
What about the boys?

13:06.786 --> 13:08.091
They're at school.
Nice try though.

13:08.265 --> 13:09.789
We think we found a way
to help you.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.008
Help me what?Help you stop running.

13:12.182 --> 13:13.140
It's a vision quest.

13:13.314 --> 13:14.402
A vision quest?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.099
No way.

13:16.273 --> 13:17.666
Leo, don't you dare leave.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.450
This is not just about you.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.713
You are a father, and
somebody's husband, too.

13:21.888 --> 13:23.977
Which is why it's too risky
for me to be here.

13:24.151 --> 13:25.805
Yeah, except you're
the one that's in danger.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
I'm an Elder.
I can take care of myself.

13:28.111 --> 13:29.112
Actually,
you haven't

13:29.286 --> 13:30.722
really been yourself lately.

13:32.202 --> 13:33.334
Look, Leo, the
vision quest

13:33.508 --> 13:34.857
helped me,
and we're just thinking

13:35.031 --> 13:36.076
maybe it could help you, too,
you know?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.338
It won't stop the creatures.

13:37.512 --> 13:38.426
How do you know?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.775
You've tried
everything else.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.081
What do you
have to lose?

13:41.255 --> 13:43.300
Your mind, your family,
your life?

13:43.474 --> 13:45.433
You've already lost all
those things, haven't you?

13:45.607 --> 13:47.087
Go ahead. Tell me I'm wrong.

13:50.351 --> 13:52.614
I'll go get the potion.

14:07.237 --> 14:08.848
Okay, when I said
I'd help you,

14:09.022 --> 14:10.980
this is not what
I had in mind.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.416
Just go. I'll be okay.Are you crazy?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.027
How is this going to be okay?

14:14.201 --> 14:15.724
Because I believe
in my guardians, remember?

14:15.898 --> 14:17.204
Look, if I'm right,
whoever set this fire

14:17.378 --> 14:18.640
is out there waiting for mine,

14:18.814 --> 14:19.946
so just say your spell
when I'm safe,

14:20.120 --> 14:20.947
and we'll see what happens.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.339
Don't worry about me.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.906
Yeah, it's a little
late for that.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.570
Which way?

14:42.620 --> 14:45.536
[indistinct voices]

14:55.459 --> 14:57.331
MAN:
You all right?

14:57.505 --> 14:59.289
It's all right.

14:59.463 --> 15:02.118
Homeland Security.

15:02.292 --> 15:03.946
Paige! Paige!

15:05.252 --> 15:07.645
Come on.

15:09.212 --> 15:13.216
"Show me what the evil sees,
even if at lightning speeds."

15:22.573 --> 15:24.314
So it is true.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.448
THIEF:
Well, well, well.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.102
What have we here?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.452
A witch?

15:31.626 --> 15:33.628
You're not getting his guardian.

15:33.802 --> 15:39.851
Now, why would I want his
when I can have yours?

15:48.208 --> 15:50.732
What's the matter?
Huh? What's wrong?

15:50.906 --> 15:54.475
I think I'm in big trouble.

15:56.738 --> 15:59.828
No, I know, Elise,
but something came up.

16:00.002 --> 16:03.136
Yes again. You don't have
to worry about my column.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.746
I promise it will be...

16:04.920 --> 16:06.095
[pounding, bumping]

16:06.269 --> 16:07.618
Uh... I got to go.

16:07.792 --> 16:10.447
Wha...? Paige?

16:10.621 --> 16:12.667
What's going on?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.278
Pai... Oh, my God!
What happened?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.498
Par for the course,
unfortunately.

16:17.672 --> 16:18.803
Par for what course?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.109
And what are
you doing here?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.284
Trying to protect your sister.

16:21.458 --> 16:23.895
I lost my guardian angel.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.375
You lost your who?

16:25.549 --> 16:26.768
You know,
protection spirits.

16:26.942 --> 16:28.465
Guides. They're with us
all the time.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.728
Yes, I know what guardian
angels are, thank you.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.730
Not just the Hallmark thing.

16:32.904 --> 16:34.428
It's real. I actually saw mine.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.082
I'm surprised
we had not seen them before.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.866
Yeah, and
the problem is,

16:38.040 --> 16:38.910
without them, people tend
to be a little vulnerable.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.609
In my case, accident prone.

16:41.783 --> 16:42.958
Okay, so I don't understand.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.177
How did you lose
your guardian angel?

16:44.351 --> 16:45.830
Well, actually,

16:46.005 --> 16:47.789
we were trying to lose mine
but then this demon...

16:47.963 --> 16:49.312
Demon, right?
Demon.

16:49.486 --> 16:51.227
Yeah. Demon comes along
and takes hers instead.

16:51.401 --> 16:52.750
Can I talk to you

16:52.924 --> 16:57.016
for a second,
please, over here?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.236
What is going on?

17:00.410 --> 17:02.108
What's going on
is that we figured out

17:02.282 --> 17:04.066
what is killing
all of those Innocents.

17:04.240 --> 17:05.937
The demon is stealing
their protectors.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.462
We think it's somehow connected
to this whole new power thing.

17:08.636 --> 17:09.811
And let me guess.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.204
This is another one
of his hunches?

17:11.378 --> 17:12.901
No. It's one of mine.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.772
But you have to admit,
all of his have panned out

17:14.946 --> 17:16.165
so far, right?

17:16.339 --> 17:18.472
Yeah. So far they have.

17:18.646 --> 17:19.864
So what's
the next move?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.910
Well, I'm going
to go I.D. the demon.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.259
Have you seen The Book of
Shadows?It wasn't upstairs.

17:23.433 --> 17:24.521
Why? You're not going
to show him

17:24.695 --> 17:25.435
The Book of Shadows,are you?

17:25.609 --> 17:27.611
Yeah, I am. I trust him.

17:27.785 --> 17:29.831
I told you that.
Look, if it
considers him

17:30.005 --> 17:31.441
a threat, it'll just zap him.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.618
Don't worry.

17:34.792 --> 17:36.359
Paige, you're my sister.

17:36.533 --> 17:37.708
I have to worry.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.101
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

17:39.275 --> 17:40.450
why don't you just come with us?

17:40.624 --> 17:42.887
I wish I could, but I can't.

17:43.062 --> 17:46.587
Leo needs some... serious help.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.110
What's new?

17:48.284 --> 17:49.807
Just promise me
you're going to be careful.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.288
I promise. I think I can
take care of one little demon.

17:52.462 --> 17:55.074
I meant Agent Brody.

17:55.248 --> 17:56.379
The Book'sin the kitchen.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.819
Everything okay?

18:01.993 --> 18:03.691
Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

18:03.865 --> 18:07.825
No problem.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.392
She lost her what?

18:09.566 --> 18:11.046
Agent Brody is watching her.
She's okay.

18:11.220 --> 18:13.309
We can't leave her alone
if she lost her guardian angel.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.920
Phoebe said she's fine.
Now, would you please focus?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.792
What am I supposed to do?

18:17.966 --> 18:20.186
Don't fight it.
Just let it take you

18:20.360 --> 18:21.926
to where you're
supposed to be.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.450
What if I want to get out?Well, you won't be able to.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.582
Not until you see what
you're supposed to see.

18:30.674 --> 18:31.936
Just sip it.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.771
Now what?

18:40.945 --> 18:42.164
Make yourself comfortable.

18:49.258 --> 18:52.218
Close your eyes,
and just let it all go.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.529
[gunfire, explosions]

18:59.703 --> 19:00.878
Get him sulfa powder!

19:01.052 --> 19:02.402
We got to stop the bleeding!

19:02.576 --> 19:04.926
He's going into shock!

19:07.058 --> 19:10.279
I need a morphine kit! Is there
a medic out in the field?

19:18.244 --> 19:20.898
What's going on?
What am I doing here?

19:21.072 --> 19:23.640
Don't worry, Dad.

19:23.814 --> 19:25.729
I'm going to help you
through this.

19:25.903 --> 19:29.472
Chris?

19:29.646 --> 19:31.344
Chris...

19:40.657 --> 19:42.006
Thank you.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.921
Yeah.

19:44.095 --> 19:45.227
Guess I never knew how much

19:45.401 --> 19:46.968
my guardian angel
actually helped me,

19:47.142 --> 19:48.709
even with the little stuff.

19:48.883 --> 19:50.145
Well, don't worry.
We'll find her.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.060
I hope.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.239
You know, maybe it'd help

19:57.413 --> 19:59.241
if you looked
at The Bookwith me.

20:11.645 --> 20:12.907
Feel better?

20:13.081 --> 20:15.126
What do you mean?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.085
I assume The Bookwon't let
anything evil touch it.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.870
Most magical
tomes don't.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.787
I mean, what do I have
to do to prove

20:23.961 --> 20:25.354
that I'm not
a threat to you?

20:25.528 --> 20:30.316
Look, I'm sorry.

20:30.490 --> 20:31.926
I am. I can't seem
to trust myself

20:32.100 --> 20:34.668
right now,
let alone anybody else.

20:34.842 --> 20:37.018
Well guardians do more
than keep you upright.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.150
I mean they're your inner voice,
your conscience,

20:39.325 --> 20:40.848
instincts.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.459
And without them, you tend
to get a little lost.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.896
You really do believe
in them, don't you?

20:46.070 --> 20:47.898
Yeah.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.944
I'm a believer all right.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.946
Hunting the new
power for years

20:52.120 --> 20:53.730
has made me realize

20:53.904 --> 20:55.689
that there's some awful
things in this world.

20:55.863 --> 20:57.821
I'd just like to think that

20:57.995 --> 21:00.607
there's some good things
too to balance it out.

21:00.781 --> 21:02.609
Like you.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.049
You found it.

21:08.223 --> 21:10.399
Celerity demons.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.271
"Celerity demons are
powerful beings

21:12.445 --> 21:14.055
"who can move at the speed
of light

21:14.229 --> 21:15.926
and feed off lesser demons."

21:16.100 --> 21:18.929
Yeah, but the guardian angels
are hardly lesser demons.

21:19.103 --> 21:20.931
Well, whether they are
or they aren't,

21:21.105 --> 21:22.629
they've been able
to steal them,

21:22.803 --> 21:24.108
the question is why.

21:28.112 --> 21:32.203
[grunts]

21:35.337 --> 21:36.469
Well done.

21:36.643 --> 21:39.254
Witches have powerful guardians.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.951
Especially a Charmed One's.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.477
How can you be sure
that she was a Charmed One?

21:44.651 --> 21:45.913
It's the only
explanation.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.741
It's the most powerful one
I possess.

21:47.915 --> 21:50.178
Still...

21:50.352 --> 21:51.266
it will not be enough

21:51.440 --> 21:53.747
when the Avatars come.

21:53.921 --> 21:55.401
Perhaps not.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.055
Unless I get the other two.

21:58.229 --> 22:01.624
After all, legend holds that the
sisters are magically connected.

22:01.798 --> 22:03.931
It stands to reason that their
guardians should be as well.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.325
How will you get them?

22:06.499 --> 22:09.458
I'll just listen
to the one I've got.

22:09.632 --> 22:11.939
She'll whisper to me
when the others need

22:12.113 --> 22:13.375
their guardians the most.

22:13.549 --> 22:15.203
When they're the most
vulnerable.

22:18.511 --> 22:20.600
You taught me well, Aku.

22:30.131 --> 22:35.179
I hope... well enough.

22:40.968 --> 22:45.364
Why isn't he saying anything?
Do you think he's all right?

22:45.538 --> 22:48.976
Yes, I think he's
doing exactly what
he needs to be doing.

22:50.586 --> 22:52.327
Sure you don't want
to help me out here?

22:52.501 --> 22:54.721
No, I'm fine right here.

22:54.895 --> 22:57.288
Sweetie, you said
it yourself.

22:57.463 --> 22:59.334
This is something
that he needs to do.

22:59.508 --> 23:01.728
Yeah, well I can have
second thoughts, can't I?

23:01.902 --> 23:03.643
I mean what if something
happens to him?

23:03.817 --> 23:06.385
Well, hopefully his guardian
angels are taking care of him.

23:06.559 --> 23:09.953
I don't think angels have
angels, Phoebe, it's redundant.

23:10.127 --> 23:11.172
You just protect ours

23:11.346 --> 23:13.348
so we can protect him.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.133
So I don't understand.

23:16.307 --> 23:18.397
If I'm in the past,
what are you doing here?

23:18.571 --> 23:19.659
I'm guiding you.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.312
So you're real?

23:21.487 --> 23:22.531
No.

23:22.705 --> 23:24.577
But I represent
something that is.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.187
I died in your arms, Dad.

23:26.361 --> 23:27.318
Killed by everything

23:27.493 --> 23:28.755
that you thought was good.

23:30.191 --> 23:31.235
I'm your root pain, okay?

23:31.410 --> 23:32.976
And I'm gonna be

23:33.150 --> 23:35.022
sticking with you until you're
ready to let me go.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.546
How will I know when that is?

23:37.720 --> 23:40.419
Come on, let's check out
some parts of your life

23:40.593 --> 23:42.116
that you really
need to remember.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.901
Do I have a choice?

23:45.075 --> 23:46.860
Hey, it's your vision quest.

23:47.034 --> 23:47.948
It's up to you.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.253
[airplane passing, gunfire]

23:49.428 --> 23:51.342
Come on.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.956
Where are we now?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.789
I never stopped loving you.

24:12.886 --> 24:14.844
That feeling is what
it's all about, Dad.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.977
You died fighting evil
in the war.

24:17.151 --> 24:19.762
And you were reborn
as a whitelighter
fighting evil again.

24:19.936 --> 24:20.894
That led you to Mom...

24:21.068 --> 24:22.939
love...

24:23.113 --> 24:24.985
to all that's good.

24:28.423 --> 24:30.469
Is that what I think it is?

24:30.643 --> 24:32.558
To the day
Wyatt was born.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.781
LEO:
Oh, I got a boy?

24:38.955 --> 24:40.174
Here you go, Mama.

24:41.654 --> 24:42.742
Hi...

24:43.656 --> 24:45.484
Hi little guy.

24:45.658 --> 24:47.747
What are you doing?

24:47.921 --> 24:49.139
Look what we did.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.359
LEO:
I see.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.188
PIPER:
It's a miracle.

24:54.362 --> 24:57.408
A little miracle.

24:58.888 --> 25:00.890
To the day when I was born.

25:06.461 --> 25:08.463
Oh, look,

25:08.637 --> 25:10.726
he's beautiful.

25:10.900 --> 25:12.249
Baby Christopher,
that's your brother.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.513
Looks like we didn't
lose him after all.

25:16.036 --> 25:17.994
Do you understand now?

25:18.168 --> 25:21.041
All the pain,
all the sacrifices,

25:21.215 --> 25:22.303
it's all been for good.

25:22.477 --> 25:23.826
That's what you're
all about, Dad.

25:24.000 --> 25:26.220
That's what you've
always been about.

25:26.394 --> 25:28.570
That's what the future's
about, too.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.269
PAIGE:
Look at your brother...

25:32.443 --> 25:34.097
You just need to believe
in that again.

25:35.664 --> 25:36.970
Can we see her?

25:37.144 --> 25:38.449
Go.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
Your family's waiting
for you.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.466
Piper...

25:55.641 --> 25:57.599
Hey... how you feeling?

25:57.773 --> 25:59.253
Good...

26:02.299 --> 26:03.736
Wait...

26:03.910 --> 26:04.911
What?

26:05.825 --> 26:06.782
What is it?

26:09.742 --> 26:10.569
Leo...

26:10.743 --> 26:13.180
Leo, wake up...

26:14.529 --> 26:16.270
Leo! Wake up!

26:25.061 --> 26:27.324
Who are you?
What do you want?

26:27.498 --> 26:29.762
I want you to see
the truth, Leo.

26:31.024 --> 26:35.681
I want you to see
the real future.

26:48.650 --> 26:49.999
PIPER:
We've gotta do something.

26:50.173 --> 26:52.088
There's nothing we can do.
He's back in the quest.

26:52.262 --> 26:53.786
Only he can get himself
out of it.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.483
But he was just out.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.094
Something made him go back in,
something he saw.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.748
I don't think anything can
get past the crystals.

26:59.922 --> 27:00.880
What about the new power?

27:01.054 --> 27:02.403
I didn't see any floating heads.

27:02.577 --> 27:04.666
Doesn't mean they weren't there.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.929
Why are you doing this?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.062
Why are you doing this to me?

27:10.933 --> 27:13.370
I want to get out of here.

27:13.544 --> 27:16.939
You can't leave yet, Leo.
You're not ready.

27:17.113 --> 27:18.767
You haven't seen what
you need to see.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.248
Why are you haunting me?

27:21.422 --> 27:23.163
Haunting?

27:23.337 --> 27:24.817
No...

27:24.991 --> 27:26.906
the creature heads

27:27.080 --> 27:30.997
were a necessary part
of guiding you to the truth.

27:31.171 --> 27:33.173
To the truth that lies

27:33.347 --> 27:35.871
beyond good and evil.

27:36.045 --> 27:36.959
To us.

27:37.133 --> 27:38.831
Us?

27:39.005 --> 27:41.050
Avatars.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.704
We are...

27:42.878 --> 27:45.272
a power.

27:45.446 --> 27:46.577
One that offers

27:46.752 --> 27:50.016
a better way.

27:50.190 --> 27:51.147
A solution

27:51.321 --> 27:53.759
to this...

27:53.933 --> 27:56.370
You see, Leo,
the future Chris
failed to mention

27:56.544 --> 27:59.765
the death of all
the people that you love.

27:59.939 --> 28:01.680
Sometimes peaceful,

28:01.854 --> 28:04.421
sometimes painful,

28:04.595 --> 28:06.772
but always

28:06.946 --> 28:09.383
inevitable.

28:09.557 --> 28:11.820
And all well before their time.

28:11.994 --> 28:13.604
Death is a part of life.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.781
Natural death, yes,

28:15.955 --> 28:20.481
but not death caused by the
pointless, endless battles

28:20.655 --> 28:22.222
between good and evil.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.354
It's not pointless,
it's necessary.

28:24.528 --> 28:26.095
And when good wins...Wins?

28:26.269 --> 28:28.532
Duality is
self-perpetuating.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.926
It feeds only on itself.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.189
That is why the battle
has been raging

28:33.363 --> 28:35.104
since the dawn of time.

28:35.278 --> 28:37.846
There is no winner.

28:38.020 --> 28:39.630
There can be.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.590
How? With good,
there is always evil.

28:42.764 --> 28:44.287
And so the battle
never ends.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.420
Not until there's nothing left.

28:46.594 --> 28:48.596
That is the future

28:48.770 --> 28:51.730
your fight is leading to...

28:51.904 --> 28:52.905
not good...

28:53.079 --> 28:54.471
nor evil...

28:54.645 --> 28:57.083
only nothing.

28:58.388 --> 29:01.565
No!

29:01.740 --> 29:03.611
No...

29:03.785 --> 29:04.960
Leo, who are you talking to?

29:05.134 --> 29:06.266
Piper, he can't hear you.

29:06.440 --> 29:07.833
Well, he's hearing someone.

29:09.922 --> 29:11.314
[indistinct voices]

29:11.488 --> 29:12.359
Leo... Leo!

29:16.276 --> 29:17.668
What was that?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.670
Stay here.Why?

29:19.845 --> 29:21.107
Just stay.

29:32.205 --> 29:34.468
Guess your guardians didn't
tell you about that.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.078
That's why I want yours.

29:36.252 --> 29:37.471
So these kinds of things

29:37.645 --> 29:39.038
don't happen again.

29:39.952 --> 29:40.779
Damn it.

29:40.953 --> 29:42.215
Paige, quick!

29:42.389 --> 29:43.390
In here!

29:49.962 --> 29:51.441
You're getting to be a pain.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.661
You can't hide in
there forever.

29:53.835 --> 29:55.619
Paige?

29:55.794 --> 29:57.621
What the hell?

30:00.276 --> 30:01.538
Leave him alone!

30:01.712 --> 30:03.105
No.
There's too much at stake.

30:03.279 --> 30:04.280
Besides,

30:04.454 --> 30:06.630
I could use the leverage.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.504
Oh, no.
[blow landing]

30:10.678 --> 30:12.158
[groans]

30:12.332 --> 30:13.550
You're not a witch.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.030
What are you?

30:16.902 --> 30:17.990
I'm a federal agent.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.556
[laughs]

30:19.730 --> 30:20.775
A what?

30:20.949 --> 30:22.429
And you know
about all this?

30:22.603 --> 30:24.648
Magic? Demons?

30:24.823 --> 30:27.651
I'm getting a quick education.

30:29.392 --> 30:31.090
That won't do you much good.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.614
I only need you long enough for
the witches to attempt a rescue.

30:33.788 --> 30:35.659
And since they're obviously
otherwise occupied...

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
and down a guardian,

30:37.009 --> 30:38.749
they won't come
all at once.

30:38.924 --> 30:42.144
Someone will get left behind,
and that's when I'll attack.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.016
[panting]

30:44.190 --> 30:45.234
I'm just curious.

30:45.408 --> 30:47.149
[coughing]

30:47.323 --> 30:49.195
What do you want with all
these... these guardians?

30:49.369 --> 30:51.240
If you don't
mind me asking.

30:51.414 --> 30:52.676
I don't want them.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.243
I need them.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.465
Worried about
the new power, are we?

30:58.639 --> 31:00.380
You know about the Avatars?

31:00.554 --> 31:01.947
Avatars?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.036
So that's what they're called?

31:04.210 --> 31:06.603
Yes, that's what
they're called.

31:06.777 --> 31:08.431
And I, for one,

31:08.605 --> 31:09.955
won't be cast
aside by them

31:10.129 --> 31:11.347
when the time comes
for them to take power--

31:11.521 --> 31:13.959
which is why I need
more guardians,

31:14.133 --> 31:16.613
which is the only reason
I'm keeping you alive.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.060
PHOEBE:
So what are you
gonna do if you find him?

31:28.234 --> 31:30.366
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

31:30.540 --> 31:31.541
I'm gonna save him.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.021
Weare going to save him.

31:33.195 --> 31:34.066
But it's a trap.

31:34.240 --> 31:35.371
The demon said
so himself.

31:35.545 --> 31:36.895
He just took him
for leverage.

31:37.069 --> 31:37.983
So we're just gonna
let him get killed?

31:38.157 --> 31:39.723
He's not gonna
kill him, okay?

31:39.898 --> 31:40.942
He needs him alive.

31:41.116 --> 31:42.422
PAIGE:
Yeah, but
for how long?

31:42.596 --> 31:43.379
Piper, help me out.

31:43.553 --> 31:45.555
I'm with Phoebe here.

31:45.729 --> 31:48.950
Sarpedon's really powerful and
he's got all those guardians.

31:49.124 --> 31:50.560
Yeah, including mine.

31:50.734 --> 31:51.692
And that's why you're
not thinking straight.

31:51.866 --> 31:53.259
Paige, we can't
go after him.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.000
It's ridiculous.

31:55.174 --> 31:57.263
Yeah, well I'm not just
gonna let him rot, either.

32:00.222 --> 32:02.137
I'll go get him myself.

32:02.311 --> 32:04.096
Wha... Oh... Pai...

32:04.270 --> 32:05.749
Oh.

32:14.497 --> 32:15.716
Kyle?

32:16.847 --> 32:18.023
Kyle?

32:23.028 --> 32:25.769
Kyle?

32:25.944 --> 32:27.771
Kyle?

32:42.177 --> 32:44.745
Okay, so now that we know where
they are, all we have to do

32:44.919 --> 32:46.268
is mix up a new
vanquishing potion

32:46.442 --> 32:47.574
and get Paige's spell.

32:47.748 --> 32:48.923
Yeah, but that
would mean

32:49.097 --> 32:50.838
we would have to go to The Book,

32:51.012 --> 32:53.667
which is in the kitchen, which
entails us going downstairs

32:53.841 --> 32:55.321
away from the
crystals, which means

32:55.495 --> 32:58.063
which means the demon
could slice and dice us.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.412
True, but for all we know,

32:59.586 --> 33:00.935
the demon could
already have Paige.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.981
Us getting killed
doesn't change that.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.678
Besides, I can't leave Leo.

33:04.852 --> 33:06.680
Okay, I know this is
really hard for you, Piper,

33:06.854 --> 33:09.944
but there's nothing that
we can do to help Leo.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.121
He's gotta fight
this fight on his own.

33:13.295 --> 33:14.644
But we can help Paige.

33:14.818 --> 33:16.690
All right, let's
just make it fast.

33:16.864 --> 33:19.910
Okay. Remember, if the demon
attacks, grab the amulet.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.477
Oh sure, yeah.
No problem.

33:30.399 --> 33:31.574
Phoebe!

33:33.489 --> 33:38.842
[indistinct voices]

33:42.846 --> 33:44.631
Next.

33:44.805 --> 33:45.762
Hey!

33:45.936 --> 33:47.590
Where's your amulet?

33:51.638 --> 33:53.074
No!

33:55.555 --> 33:57.557
[grunts]

33:57.731 --> 33:59.341
Leo...

33:59.515 --> 34:01.039
[grunts]

34:13.616 --> 34:15.444
What do you mean,
this is the end?

34:15.618 --> 34:17.620
The end of what?

34:17.794 --> 34:20.058
The end of the battle...

34:20.232 --> 34:22.364
between good and evil.

34:22.538 --> 34:24.584
Its outcome--

34:24.758 --> 34:28.109
Mutual destruction,

34:28.283 --> 34:32.026
and the eternal void
that necessarily follows.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.072
How is this possible?

34:34.246 --> 34:37.553
I'm afraid it's unavoidable.

34:37.727 --> 34:41.035
A flawed design.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.736
There is, however, another way.

34:46.910 --> 34:49.087
A better way.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.786
That is what we
represent, Leo,

34:52.960 --> 34:55.441
but we'll need
your help to implement.

34:56.920 --> 35:00.054
And the Charmed Ones, of
course, when they're ready.

35:00.228 --> 35:01.447
What way is that?

35:01.621 --> 35:03.623
Utopia.

35:03.797 --> 35:07.801
A world where good and
evil no longer exist.

35:07.975 --> 35:12.414
Where the battle is behind
you, behind everyone.

35:12.588 --> 35:17.027
A world where you and Piper
no longer have to suffer

35:17.202 --> 35:20.248
through the obstacles
that have kept you apart.

35:23.512 --> 35:24.818
What's the catch?

35:24.992 --> 35:29.257
Only the courage to change.

35:31.738 --> 35:34.393
Unless it's
already too late.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.353
Piper?

35:38.527 --> 35:39.702
She's not here, Leo.

35:39.876 --> 35:42.662
I'm afraid there
isn't much time.

35:42.836 --> 35:44.054
Piper!

35:45.839 --> 35:47.145
Piper!

35:53.281 --> 35:54.413
No.

35:58.243 --> 35:59.983
Why did you do this?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.203
We didn't do this, Leo.

36:02.377 --> 36:04.292
Evil did.

36:05.772 --> 36:07.252
It might not
be too late,

36:07.426 --> 36:08.427
though, to
reverse it,

36:08.601 --> 36:11.386
if...you'll join us.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.346
You can save them?

36:14.520 --> 36:16.696
We can save everyone, Leo.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.525
With your help.

36:24.443 --> 36:26.053
So be it.

36:39.893 --> 36:42.330
Welcome to the fold...

36:42.504 --> 36:45.246
What do I do next?

36:45.420 --> 36:47.292
Heal them.

36:47.466 --> 36:50.077
I can't heal them,
they're dead.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.079
You're an Avatar now, Leo.

36:52.253 --> 36:55.213
You have all you need.

36:55.387 --> 36:57.389
You have... the powers.

37:30.422 --> 37:31.553
Leo?

37:37.820 --> 37:40.258
Piper!You're back.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.613
I thought I was...Dead?

37:49.615 --> 37:50.703
Where did
you get that?

37:50.877 --> 37:52.835
From the demon I guess.

37:53.009 --> 37:55.098
Oh, so that's it? It's over?

37:56.491 --> 37:57.579
Is it?

37:59.189 --> 38:01.801
I've never seen you heal
anyone like that, Leo.

38:03.237 --> 38:04.891
Did something happen to you?

38:05.065 --> 38:06.371
What do you mean?

38:06.545 --> 38:07.633
In the vision quest,
you seemed

38:07.807 --> 38:09.069
like you were in pain.

38:10.549 --> 38:14.770
Yeah, well... something
I had to go through I guess...

38:14.944 --> 38:15.989
to see the truth.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.070
Ooh, you guys
look great

39:37.244 --> 39:38.593
for being recently deceased.

We weren't dead!

My bad.

because we almost

40:01.529 --> 40:03.401
got him killed doesn't mean
we have to trust him.

Oh, come on, now.
Enough of this already.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.318
Everything turned out fine
like it always does.

40:08.493 --> 40:10.712
Well... almost
always does.

40:10.886 --> 40:13.454
Except for the Avatars.

Kyle said that that's what
the demon called the new power.

back together.
