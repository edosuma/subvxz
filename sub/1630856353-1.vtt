So we're still thinking

30:27.826 --> 30:31.351
a straightforward accidental?

DCI MAGGIE KNIGHT:
I'm not thinking anything

Why are you trying to blame

Was he drunk? Was he high?
Was it maybe even suicide?

This is a routine investigation.

in the tape is Dan, with Harper.

own powers if the need arises,
