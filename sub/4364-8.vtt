00:02.000 --> 00:04.840
- These are my boys, Richard and Thomas Grey. 
- Will you marry me? 

00:04.840 --> 00:08.400
- Yes! 
- You are not married, Elizabeth! 

00:08.400 --> 00:12.760
It was a pretend service. He's done it before and he has a bastard son. 

00:12.760 --> 00:15.560
I am not happy about this marriage. 

00:15.560 --> 00:17.880
Your daughter could never be royal. 

00:17.880 --> 00:20.400
Jane Shore, her name's all around the Court. 

00:20.400 --> 00:23.160
Your husband is a king with a king's appetites. 

00:23.160 --> 00:25.240
Have you known loss, Lady Margaret? 

00:25.240 --> 00:27.720
My only son is forced to live away from me. 

00:27.720 --> 00:30.880
He is heir to the House of Lancaster, an enemy to the King. 

00:30.880 --> 00:33.640
Jasper, you're the only man I trust to look after him. 

00:33.640 --> 00:35.680
Are we to live in Wales? 

00:35.680 --> 00:38.000
We won't but our son will. 

00:38.000 --> 00:41.400
Then I will appoint his guardian. I am his mother. And if he is to leave me, 

00:41.400 --> 00:44.920
I will choose into whose care he will go and who will raise him into a man. 

00:44.920 --> 00:48.520
I want you to take my son, Anthony. You are the only one I can trust with him. 

00:48.520 --> 00:51.000
We are the three sons of York. 

00:51.000 --> 00:53.800
How can we be divided by one woman? 

00:53.800 --> 00:57.200
Your Henry is going to have to walk past five coffins to take the crown 

00:57.200 --> 01:00.240
and I don't know how he's going to manage that. Do you?

02:18.800 --> 02:21.520
You're too long in Brittany, Henry Tudor. 

02:21.520 --> 02:24.960
You do that to a Welsh knight and see if you're still smiling. 

02:24.960 --> 02:27.520
I can only beat what you put in front of me, Uncle. 

02:29.880 --> 02:31.880
Well, your timing is perfect. 

02:33.000 --> 02:35.040
Absolutely perfect. 

02:49.160 --> 02:53.720
Hmm. Lovely. The perfect match for gracious King Edward. 

02:56.120 --> 03:00.800
- Gracious? 
- Truly. Allowing my son to return from exile. 

03:05.840 --> 03:10.520
Well, perhaps it shows how secure the King is on the throne. 

03:10.520 --> 03:13.040
It seems your boy is not a threat to us any more. 

03:15.360 --> 03:17.840
He's a man now. 

03:17.840 --> 03:22.880
Of course. He's been away so long, you must hardly know him. 

03:28.040 --> 03:30.360
CHATTER 

03:46.360 --> 03:48.440
Ah, my prize catch! 

03:48.440 --> 03:52.200
From your boasts, Father, I half expected an army to bring it in. 

03:52.200 --> 03:55.560
Princess Elizabeth will be having a small portion for that remark. 

03:55.560 --> 03:58.640
And I'll be having yours as you've clearly had too many of late. 

03:58.640 --> 04:01.440
I am merely eating like a king. Shall we dine alone tonight, 

04:01.440 --> 04:04.240
send these little leeches away to eat with the peasantry? 

04:04.240 --> 04:08.680
Leeches! He called me a leech, Thomas! 

04:08.680 --> 04:10.200
SHE LAUGHS 

04:10.200 --> 04:13.600
Have as much as you like, Father. You've earned the right to enjoy yourself. 

04:13.600 --> 04:15.160
More wine, Father? 

04:15.160 --> 04:19.959
Thank you, Richard, Cecily, all my delightful children. 

04:19.959 --> 04:21.800
And my queen. 

04:24.000 --> 04:25.960
Are you unwell? 

04:25.960 --> 04:27.560
You're warm. 

04:28.560 --> 04:30.320
It's nothing. 

04:56.280 --> 04:58.160
My son is coming home. 

04:59.560 --> 05:03.560
I think Jasper Tudor would be glad to come home, too. 

05:03.560 --> 05:06.400
Well, he can come home... 

05:06.400 --> 05:08.200
to the block. 

05:09.600 --> 05:11.160
Don't get your hopes up, Margaret. 

05:11.160 --> 05:13.680
Your son is not returning home as a contender to the throne. 

05:13.680 --> 05:17.920
He's just...another pretender that Edward's brought to heel. 

05:19.040 --> 05:22.280
I still believe God will have my son on the throne of England. 

05:23.480 --> 05:26.560
But what are you doing about it? What's your plan? 

05:30.960 --> 05:32.480
Pray for a miracle? 

05:36.440 --> 05:38.840
HE GAGS AND COUGHS 

05:40.600 --> 05:45.720
Here. Here, sip this. Shhh! Darling, what pains you? 

05:52.200 --> 05:55.200
Wife...to bed. 

05:55.200 --> 05:58.080
I think Your Grace should save his strength. 

05:58.080 --> 06:00.480
- Oh! Edward! 
- HE GROANS 

06:02.640 --> 06:06.800
Help! Somebody! Oh, the King! 

06:09.080 --> 06:10.840
The King! 

06:16.440 --> 06:19.520
It's a fever. It'll pass. 

06:19.520 --> 06:21.000
Fevers pass. 

06:22.200 --> 06:25.800
My brother, Richard, send for him. 

06:31.200 --> 06:35.120
Shhh. It's not necessary. 

06:35.120 --> 06:37.320
You're strong. 

06:37.320 --> 06:39.520
You don't lose. 

06:39.520 --> 06:41.360
You are a born warrior. 

06:45.320 --> 06:46.840
Fight this for me. 

06:49.920 --> 06:51.640
Do as I ask, Elizabeth. 

07:05.040 --> 07:07.440
- Lady Mother, what is the cause of this? 
- Nobody knows. 

07:07.440 --> 07:12.080
- Is it something he ate? 
- We all had the same at dinner, there's no sign of food poison. 

07:12.080 --> 07:15.080
All we can do is wait for the fever to break. 

07:15.080 --> 07:17.800
Send word to Richard, the Privy Councillors. 

07:17.800 --> 07:20.440
And find Uncle Anthony, Thomas. 

07:29.640 --> 07:32.400
- Prepare horses, my clothes. 
- Yes, my lord. 

07:32.400 --> 07:34.680
Weapons. We ride to London. 

07:34.680 --> 07:36.880
Richard, what's the matter? Are we at war? 

07:37.960 --> 07:39.360
The King is gravely ill. 

07:41.000 --> 07:44.720
But his heir is just a boy, not ready to reign. 

07:47.000 --> 07:49.360
Elizabeth. 

07:49.360 --> 07:52.440
She will try to rule through him as she does through Edward. 

07:53.640 --> 07:55.040
This is your divine act! 

07:55.040 --> 07:58.760
I'm sure the Queen will fish out some potion to restore his... 

08:17.200 --> 08:20.200
QUIET SOBBING 

08:22.800 --> 08:27.080
I must send word to Brittany. Henry must stay put for now. 

08:27.080 --> 08:28.400
If the King should die... 

08:28.400 --> 08:31.440
We should wait until we know who is Lord Protector. 

08:31.440 --> 08:33.240
We must be cautious... 

08:35.400 --> 08:38.200
..but ready to grasp any opportunity if it comes up. 

08:39.280 --> 08:41.080
Let's just see how it plays out. 

08:51.240 --> 08:53.760
Anyone would think they've come for a fight. 

08:56.560 --> 08:58.760
- Take the Duke's horse. 
- Yes, sir. Whoa! 

09:15.200 --> 09:17.840
We thank you, Your Grace, for sending for us. 

09:17.840 --> 09:19.360
How is my brother? 

09:19.360 --> 09:21.080
You're here just in time. 

09:26.680 --> 09:28.200
You saw the look she cut us. 

09:37.520 --> 09:40.440
Her fortunes fade with the King. 

09:40.440 --> 09:44.440
She's like a wounded beast defending her lair. 

09:44.440 --> 09:46.360
And you're a threat. 

09:49.400 --> 09:51.280
Be wary. 

09:58.280 --> 09:59.800
Brackenbury. 

10:02.240 --> 10:04.040
Buckingham. 

10:09.240 --> 10:12.280
COUGHING 

10:19.000 --> 10:21.360
It is the fate of kings 

10:21.360 --> 10:24.760
that we never get to see what kind of ruler our sons will be. 

10:24.760 --> 10:30.000
I will never get to know what kind of man my sweet boy will become. 

10:31.880 --> 10:35.880
I beg you...be as one now. 

10:37.200 --> 10:39.080
Care for Prince Edward. 

10:40.360 --> 10:42.000
Keep him safe. 

10:45.160 --> 10:50.000
I will work with all of you...to put Prince Edward on the throne. 

10:52.200 --> 10:53.440
And I, Your Grace. 

10:55.600 --> 10:56.800
And I. 

11:01.000 --> 11:03.200
Anthony. 

11:18.280 --> 11:19.880
Richard shall be guardian. 

11:22.400 --> 11:23.800
As you wish. 

11:25.080 --> 11:26.800
Surely you mean Anthony? 

11:30.640 --> 11:34.320
Richard is Lord Protector until Prince Edward comes of age. 

11:38.520 --> 11:40.600
Do you accept this, Elizabeth? 

11:54.000 --> 11:55.600
Now leave us. 

11:57.720 --> 12:00.560
I want to say goodbye to my husband. 

12:04.040 --> 12:09.200
Look upon your king one last time and remember him in your prayers. 

12:34.000 --> 12:36.400
I will honour your wish. 

13:04.400 --> 13:06.200
I know this does not please you. 

13:08.680 --> 13:12.600
Anthony is his true guardian. He has taught him everything he knows. 

13:12.600 --> 13:14.520
Anthony's name goes against him. 

13:16.160 --> 13:19.280
The Rivers are esteemed by the people, but not the Court. 

13:21.040 --> 13:22.960
I trust Richard to do what I ask. 

13:27.080 --> 13:29.080
I did it for peace. 

13:29.080 --> 13:31.560
I know. I just... 

13:31.560 --> 13:35.040
Please don't make me waste my last words on matters of state. 

13:44.240 --> 13:46.000
You are the love of my life. 

13:54.160 --> 13:56.280
You are mine. 

14:00.600 --> 14:03.200
Thank you, lovely Elizabeth... 

14:06.040 --> 14:08.480
..for waiting under that oak tree. 

14:08.480 --> 14:09.520
SHE LAUGHS 

14:11.680 --> 14:13.360
For wanting me. 

14:19.920 --> 14:23.960
You gave me...another chance. 

14:25.840 --> 14:27.560
A better life. 

14:30.760 --> 14:33.160
Beautiful children! 

14:35.440 --> 14:37.800
Certainty. 

14:55.560 --> 14:57.880
- No! 
- SHE SOBS 

14:57.880 --> 14:59.880
No! 

14:59.880 --> 15:03.440
No! No! No! 

15:03.440 --> 15:05.920
SHE WAILS 

15:11.680 --> 15:15.080
Mother? Mother! 

15:52.840 --> 15:55.920
You won't even bow to me! 

15:58.280 --> 16:00.920
We're equal now. 

16:00.920 --> 16:03.160
Both mothers to a king. 

16:35.600 --> 16:37.320
This tension is unbearable. 

16:39.000 --> 16:40.960
We must sustain it. 

16:50.880 --> 16:53.480
- Sister, I am so sorry. 
- Get word to my son, Richard Grey, 

16:53.480 --> 16:55.680
and tell him to bring Prince Edward here from Wales. 

16:55.680 --> 16:59.480
People are already taking sides and I fear the outcome. 

16:59.480 --> 17:05.200
- Elizabeth? 
- It will be Richard and the Yorks around my boy's throne 

17:05.200 --> 17:10.680
- and I'll be sent back to Grafton! 
- You won't. Richard is a decent man. 

17:10.680 --> 17:12.440
He loved the King. 

17:12.440 --> 17:15.839
- Swore to do right by your son. 
- I don't trust any of them! 

17:20.960 --> 17:26.560
I...need my son, the King, to protect me. 

17:29.160 --> 17:31.120
Send word, Anthony. 

17:32.680 --> 17:36.520
I want my son here now, so he can be crowned. 

17:38.440 --> 17:40.840
Get that boy. 

17:40.840 --> 17:43.840
- Mother, please, not now. 
- She's right. 

17:43.840 --> 17:46.000
Keep him away from her. 

17:46.000 --> 17:48.920
She accepted Edward's decision. 

17:48.920 --> 17:53.200
So Edward would die happy. She was lying through gritted teeth. 

17:53.200 --> 17:57.400
She had George executed, poisoned Isabel, 

17:57.400 --> 18:01.240
who knows what she'd do to secure the throne for the Rivers. 

18:01.240 --> 18:04.520
Your sister died from childbirth! 

18:04.520 --> 18:07.120
I know you don't trust her, 

18:07.120 --> 18:12.200
I know to be careful and I know what has to be done. 

18:12.200 --> 18:14.400
So leave being Lord Protector to me. 

18:22.720 --> 18:24.280
Sir Robert. 

18:32.320 --> 18:36.040
- Mistress Shore. 
- Your Grace, I am truly sorry. 

18:36.040 --> 18:39.480
Please. The Queen has just lost her husband. 

18:39.480 --> 18:41.840
Show some respect. 

18:41.840 --> 18:44.680
- You have no place here now. 
- But, Your Graces... 

18:44.680 --> 18:48.000
Brackenbury, throw this woman out. 

18:48.000 --> 18:50.120
Her kind is not welcome at Court. 

18:54.160 --> 18:58.280
- Your Grace. 
- Please, I'm no longer... This is my home. I have nowhere to go. 

18:59.440 --> 19:02.160
Make sure she leaves, Sir Robert. 

19:02.160 --> 19:04.400
Then ready my horse and good men. 

19:30.680 --> 19:33.240
MEN SHOUT OUTSIDE 

19:41.240 --> 19:43.600
This isn't goodbye. 

19:43.600 --> 19:45.360
He's not going anywhere just yet. 

19:45.360 --> 19:47.360
What? 

19:47.360 --> 19:49.440
Word from your mother. 

19:49.440 --> 19:51.320
A change of plan. 

19:51.320 --> 19:53.080
Come on, out. 

19:55.000 --> 19:56.360
Out. 

20:04.040 --> 20:05.840
The King is dead. 

20:09.640 --> 20:11.720
Huh! How? 

20:11.720 --> 20:14.280
Fever...apparently. 

20:15.560 --> 20:18.600
- So what now? 
- We wait and see what happens. 

20:21.880 --> 20:23.880
We must be ready to raise an army. 

20:25.160 --> 20:29.560
For when you do return...you will be fighting for the throne. 

20:42.200 --> 20:44.240
Stay back. 

20:44.240 --> 20:47.080
- Whoa! 
- HORSE WHINNIES 

20:57.280 --> 20:59.040
My Lord Grey. 

21:00.360 --> 21:02.640
What is this, Brackenbury? 

21:02.640 --> 21:05.560
We're to escort the King to the Tower for his protection. 

21:05.560 --> 21:10.000
We are grateful for your concern, but I too have orders to take the Prince to Westminster. 

21:10.000 --> 21:13.520
I'm going to see my mother. Prepare my horse. 

21:20.600 --> 21:23.640
- Argh! 
- Stop! 

21:26.480 --> 21:30.200
- Forgive me. 
- Richard, I demand the right to ride on. 

21:30.200 --> 21:34.360
- Lower your sword, sir. 
- I won't until you let us pass. 

21:34.360 --> 21:36.640
Secure the Prince's safety. 

21:38.400 --> 21:41.000
Stop it! Don't touch him. 

21:41.000 --> 21:43.920
I promised your father I would keep you safe. 

21:46.200 --> 21:48.160
- No! 
- Edward! 

21:48.160 --> 21:50.200
Edward! 

22:04.760 --> 22:06.720
Jane? 

22:06.720 --> 22:08.880
What is it? 

22:08.880 --> 22:12.080
I'm banished from Court. My family turned me away. 

22:12.080 --> 22:14.800
Friends won't give me shelter. 

22:14.800 --> 22:16.880
- Help me! 
- Come in. 

22:25.640 --> 22:28.960
I didn't think my fall from grace would be so swift. 

22:37.520 --> 22:38.840
Thank you. 

22:42.360 --> 22:46.200
The death of a king always causes disharmony. 

22:46.200 --> 22:48.680
People overreact, take sides. 

22:50.280 --> 22:53.920
This will all blow over once young Edward is crowned. 

22:53.920 --> 22:58.800
You haven't heard? Richard has taken Prince Edward to the tower. 

23:00.960 --> 23:05.320
I regret what happened to your guard, but my men were there to protect you. 

23:05.320 --> 23:06.880
You outnumbered us. 

23:06.880 --> 23:10.240
You are safe here. Until you are the King, you are vulnerable. 

23:11.560 --> 23:15.680
What sort of Protector would Uncle Richard be if he put you even in the slightest danger? 

23:15.680 --> 23:17.720
I wish to console my mother. 

23:19.920 --> 23:21.760
She is suffering, Edward. 

23:23.160 --> 23:25.360
Better to go when she's herself again. 

23:26.960 --> 23:28.960
I'll visit in the morning. 

23:30.080 --> 23:32.200
We have much to discuss. 

23:32.200 --> 23:34.080
And I am sorry. 

23:52.200 --> 23:54.400
How dare he terrorize my sons? 

23:54.400 --> 23:57.800
He claims he's keeping Prince Edward safe, just keeping his promise. 

23:57.800 --> 23:59.880
- You believe that? 
- Yes. 

23:59.880 --> 24:02.680
I knew I should have gone to fetch him myself. 

24:02.680 --> 24:06.640
- Then you'd be in the Tower too. 
- I've petitioned the Privy Council to demand their release. 

24:06.640 --> 24:09.000
Anthony! This is an act of war. 

24:09.000 --> 24:12.640
- We must raise men now. 
- And risk your brother's safety? 

24:12.640 --> 24:16.200
You're upset, rightly, but have faith that Richard will do what is right... 

24:16.200 --> 24:19.080
He put Edward in the Tower to keep him from me. 

24:19.080 --> 24:21.000
And he arrested Richard Grey. 

24:21.000 --> 24:24.840
Take everything of value, wake your brother and your sisters, we're going into sanctuary. 

24:24.840 --> 24:28.680
- Sister! 
- Lizzie. 
- Mother, talk to Uncle Richard. 

24:28.680 --> 24:30.560
Or get Anthony to. 

24:30.560 --> 24:33.480
Ask him to let my brothers go as a show of consideration. 

24:33.480 --> 24:36.880
Only fools wait to see if their enemies might be friends! 

24:38.680 --> 24:42.920
Richard's got Edward, what's stopping him from snatching my other son? 

24:44.320 --> 24:45.880
Do as I say! 

24:49.960 --> 24:52.400
I'll send word to my brother to ready the fleet. 

24:52.400 --> 24:54.200
You mustn't do this! 

24:54.200 --> 24:58.360
- Join us after. 
- I'd serve you all better on the outside as your eyes and ears. 

24:58.360 --> 25:00.400
Send word when it's done. 

25:03.200 --> 25:04.760
Take care, Thomas. 

25:06.600 --> 25:10.000
Please! You must trust him. 

25:10.000 --> 25:11.920
I trust nobody! 

25:14.200 --> 25:17.560
Play your politics to secure my sons' release. 

25:17.560 --> 25:21.080
If anything happens to them, I will never forgive you! 

25:29.280 --> 25:33.800
Not just jewels, she's taken the entire Treasury to Westminster 

25:33.800 --> 25:36.560
to provide for her children in sanctuary. 

25:36.560 --> 25:38.760
How long does she plan to stay? 

25:38.760 --> 25:42.080
This truly is a gift. 

25:42.080 --> 25:45.240
The boys' abduction gives Elizabeth reason to doubt Richard 

25:45.240 --> 25:49.560
and her taking off with the war chest gives him cause to fear her. 

25:49.560 --> 25:52.480
- If this escalates... 
- They fight for the crown. 

25:52.480 --> 25:56.800
Well, one or the other could fall, they could destroy each other. 

25:56.800 --> 26:00.200
The throne would be empty, my son's to claim. 

26:00.200 --> 26:02.680
SHE SIGHS Is this our chance? 

26:05.280 --> 26:08.880
They're all in the abbey, apart from Thomas Grey. 

26:08.880 --> 26:11.920
We've intercepted a letter from him to his uncle, Edward Rivers. 

26:11.920 --> 26:15.560
- The Lord Admiral? 
- They wish to ready the fleet. 

26:21.360 --> 26:24.480
Arrest the Lord Admiral and Thomas Grey for treason. 

26:26.440 --> 26:29.760
We can't have them plotting against me. 

26:29.760 --> 26:31.880
Rally the men, all of them. 

26:43.880 --> 26:47.520
- Why? Why would Elizabeth do this? 
- Because she's devious. 

26:47.520 --> 26:50.520
When will you accept she doesn't want you anywhere near her son? 

26:50.520 --> 26:52.760
She could buy an army with those riches. 

26:52.760 --> 26:56.440
Perhaps. But what can she achieve from sanctuary? 

27:00.720 --> 27:03.640
You've a short memory. 

27:03.640 --> 27:06.280
She called up a mist to conceal your advance 

27:06.280 --> 27:09.960
upon my father's forces at Barnet the last time she was there. 

27:11.880 --> 27:16.680
Guard yourself against her ways, protect yourself and the King's legacy. 

27:17.720 --> 27:22.440
That's all I want, to crown his son, like he asked. 

27:22.440 --> 27:24.200
Then do it. 

27:24.200 --> 27:29.320
And name yourself Lord Protector, before she can do anything about it. 

27:30.520 --> 27:34.960
I'll send a message saying that I will not be intimidated. 

27:42.160 --> 27:45.720
Soldiers, everywhere. The gates, cloisters. 

27:46.960 --> 27:49.040
Then this is war. 

27:49.040 --> 27:52.200
No. No, no, Mother. 

27:52.200 --> 27:55.560
We can't fight Richard, the York Army, from this dungeon! 

27:55.560 --> 27:58.240
Do you think that is what your father thought 

27:58.240 --> 28:01.600
when he faced the Lancastrian Army four times his number at Barnet? 

28:01.600 --> 28:04.920
No. He won the greatest victory in England's history! 

28:04.920 --> 28:07.280
And he is in every one of you. 

28:07.280 --> 28:11.480
His is the voice charging you to be valiant and brave. 

28:11.480 --> 28:17.240
We might be boxed in here, but we have him watching over us. 

29:04.560 --> 29:07.120
Forgive me. 

29:08.200 --> 29:11.240
It has been a tiring few days. 

29:12.640 --> 29:14.920
Well, then, may I offer my services, 

29:14.920 --> 29:17.480
as Your Grace is likely to be at Court a while? 

29:31.280 --> 29:34.080
The last thing the country needs is a lack of direction. 

29:38.480 --> 29:40.520
Forgive me, ladies, 

29:40.520 --> 29:44.240
I don't feel up to a fitting for the Prince's coronation just now. 

29:45.880 --> 29:47.920
Your Grace. 

30:00.600 --> 30:03.880
He will be crowned three days from now. 

30:35.440 --> 30:37.400
I bring news from your brother Anthony. 

30:37.400 --> 30:39.440
Please let me in. 

30:53.920 --> 30:55.960
Your Grace. 

30:57.680 --> 31:00.160
Anthony is keeping his distance to appear detached 

31:00.160 --> 31:01.640
but he petitions for you. 

31:01.640 --> 31:05.640
He's convinced Richard to set a date for Edward's coronation, three days from now. 

31:05.640 --> 31:08.680
How do I know this is not a trap, set by Richard, to lure us out? 

31:08.680 --> 31:12.720
Richard cast me out, threw me onto the streets the moment the king died. 

31:14.080 --> 31:16.880
So Anthony now provides for you? 

31:16.880 --> 31:19.440
I admire him greatly. 

31:19.440 --> 31:21.800
It's why I risk so much coming here. 

31:24.080 --> 31:26.200
Cecily. 

31:35.120 --> 31:37.160
- Richard plans on crowning my son? 
- Yes. 

31:37.160 --> 31:40.680
Anthony thinks you should go to the coronation and show you can work with Richard. 

31:40.680 --> 31:41.920
That will never happen. 

31:41.920 --> 31:45.920
I have demands of my own - that he releases my sons and that Richard's punished! 

31:45.920 --> 31:50.360
Mother. Anthony has brokered a truce, offered us a way out. 

31:51.680 --> 31:54.000
Don't undermine his efforts. 

31:55.480 --> 32:00.640
Tell him I'd feel better if he removed the soldiers from the abbey. 

32:00.640 --> 32:02.640
And tell Anthony I'll consider it. 

32:03.920 --> 32:05.800
Tell him I am sorry. 

32:07.600 --> 32:09.440
I said things in rage. 

32:11.320 --> 32:13.360
Your Graces. 

32:25.280 --> 32:27.320
The soldiers, they're gone. 

32:31.360 --> 32:35.760
Richard's yielding. Anthony must have conveyed your request. 

32:38.720 --> 32:40.760
Wait. 

32:40.760 --> 32:44.200
Can we trust Richard? 

32:44.200 --> 32:47.080
Should we now attend Edward's coronation? 

32:49.720 --> 32:52.640
All of Richard's soldiers left? 

32:52.640 --> 32:55.360
Anthony Rivers requested it and assured an end to hostilities. 

32:55.360 --> 32:56.800
They're still wary of each other. 

32:56.800 --> 32:59.120
But they're just not killing each other. 

33:00.200 --> 33:01.840
We must end this truce. 

33:01.840 --> 33:05.920
- Elizabeth must not be allowed to trust Richard. 
- Agreed. 

33:12.120 --> 33:14.800
- Edward, a bastard? 
- Our cooks were gossiping about it. 

33:14.800 --> 33:17.320
Naturally, I scolded and warned them never to repeat... 

33:17.320 --> 33:21.040
- And who's telling you these old rumours? 
- Soldiers. 

33:23.240 --> 33:26.560
No. Such conduct is shameful. 

33:26.560 --> 33:29.360
It would be beneath most soldiers I know. 

33:29.360 --> 33:31.400
These were Richard's men. 

33:31.400 --> 33:33.960
Why are you telling me this? 

33:33.960 --> 33:36.400
Because I worry for you all. 

33:36.400 --> 33:39.600
If this is true and Richard were to recall Parliament, 

33:39.600 --> 33:42.240
declare Edward illegitimate, you'd lose everything. 

33:42.240 --> 33:44.480
Your children would be disinherited. 

33:44.480 --> 33:46.200
What if he's not after peace? 

33:47.920 --> 33:49.760
There is one other thing. 

33:50.760 --> 33:54.440
As you were away from Court, I felt you needed eyes and ears there, 

33:54.440 --> 33:57.040
so I offered my services to Anne. 

33:57.040 --> 33:59.240
How very kind of you(!) 

33:59.240 --> 34:02.920
This may be trivial, but how do you understand Anne's refusal 

34:02.920 --> 34:05.160
to be fitted for your son's coronation? 

34:06.600 --> 34:10.440
- What? 
- I may be reading too much into it, she may have enough gowns. 

34:13.600 --> 34:18.040
Or... Or she's not going, for there may not even be a coronation. 

34:22.719 --> 34:24.679
No. No. 

34:26.800 --> 34:29.159
Jane Shore, passing messages to Elizabeth? 

34:29.159 --> 34:31.120
From your enemies, I'm told. 

34:31.120 --> 34:33.719
- Told by whom? 
- It's the talk of Court, my Lord. 

34:34.840 --> 34:41.080
- With respect, it's unlikely that people would concern Your Graces with such a seedy matter. 
- Yet you do. 

34:41.080 --> 34:43.560
I raise it only to protect you, your reputation. 

34:43.560 --> 34:46.040
I'm sure you wouldn't want to be seen to be out-manoeuvred 

34:46.040 --> 34:48.880
by the Queen and her growing band of conspirators? 

34:48.880 --> 34:51.000
Nor played by you, Stanley. 

34:51.000 --> 34:54.840
- My Lord, I would never do any... 
- No, but your tone is leading. 

34:56.159 --> 34:58.160
I am able to make my own judgments. 

35:01.000 --> 35:05.200
It seems banishing Jane Shore has given her cause to defy me. 

35:06.760 --> 35:10.200
Why would Elizabeth plot with her husband's mistress? 

35:10.200 --> 35:13.240
Desperation? Her friends must be few. 

35:13.240 --> 35:15.760
You should have men follow the whore, 

35:15.760 --> 35:17.400
see who she's in bed with now. 

35:18.480 --> 35:21.240
"In remembering th'unsteadfastness 

35:21.240 --> 35:23.640
"This world being of such wheeling 

35:23.640 --> 35:25.360
"Me... 

35:25.360 --> 35:27.160
"Contrary?" 

35:29.040 --> 35:32.680
Contrary... What may I guess? 

35:34.680 --> 35:38.440
It's a first stanza. I need to finish it. 

35:45.920 --> 35:49.640
LOUD BANG What in God's name? 

35:55.160 --> 35:57.360
Arrest the traitor. 

35:57.360 --> 36:00.080
- Get off me. 
- Leave him alone. Stop it. 

36:00.080 --> 36:02.480
Get off me. Don't touch me. Get out! 

36:02.480 --> 36:05.640
- Get out! 
- Cover yourself. 

36:05.640 --> 36:09.200
- Get out! Get out! 
- QUIET! 

36:12.160 --> 36:15.520
- Who else is in this house? 
- Nobody. 

36:30.040 --> 36:32.760
Thomas Grey. Find him! 

36:37.360 --> 36:39.400
Anthony? 

36:40.760 --> 36:45.560
He's always been so loyal to me, even these past few days. 

36:49.720 --> 36:53.280
He's a Rivers. Her brother. 

36:56.600 --> 36:58.720
You must punish him and his whore. 

37:00.280 --> 37:03.160
I vowed... 

37:03.160 --> 37:08.840
We all swore to be as one, care for the child, see him crowned. 

37:13.600 --> 37:18.520
Then you must do what your heart tells you with more authority. 

37:20.200 --> 37:23.480
If the soldiers in the abbey didn't scare Elizabeth into submission 

37:23.480 --> 37:25.120
then do something that will. 

37:27.040 --> 37:29.360
Show them who's the real Lord Protector. 

37:33.120 --> 37:35.160
CROWDS JEER AND CALL 

37:43.280 --> 37:48.520
Deus meus, ex toto corde me paenitet. 

37:52.520 --> 37:54.080
Ac doleo de omnibus... 

37:55.440 --> 37:57.480
They pity her. 

38:01.360 --> 38:06.880
Christi super omnia diligaris. 

38:06.880 --> 38:12.360
Per merita passionis Salvatoris nostri Iesu Christi, 

38:12.360 --> 38:14.480
Domine, miserere. 

38:25.520 --> 38:29.840
Richard, I plead with you to listen to reason. 

38:31.200 --> 38:33.040
I am not your enemy. 

38:34.320 --> 38:39.640
- KNOCK ON DOOR 
- It's Buckingham. May I come in? 

38:39.640 --> 38:42.720
(Hide, hide. Quick, hide.) 

38:45.160 --> 38:47.200
A private word with Your Grace. 

38:50.120 --> 38:53.040
This is from Richard. He handed it to me as I left. 

38:53.040 --> 38:56.520
He thought his nieces and nephew might want some fresh food. 

38:59.520 --> 39:01.280
Why are you really here? 

39:01.280 --> 39:04.600
He would very much like Prince Richard to join his older brother 

39:04.600 --> 39:07.240
- in preparation for his coronation. 
- No. 

39:07.240 --> 39:12.480
For moral support and so he can be fitted with a handsome outfit. 

39:14.920 --> 39:19.080
Would Your Grace like his tunic embroidered in gold, rubies? 

39:19.080 --> 39:22.160
Perhaps he would just like to see his older brother? 

39:22.160 --> 39:25.160
My son has a cold and can't go anywhere. 

39:25.160 --> 39:28.200
Ah, Richard won't be happy at all. 

39:33.560 --> 39:38.880
But...I will not take a sick child from his mother. 

39:44.320 --> 39:48.720
- Anthony has been arrested, along with his mistress, Jane Shore. 
- What? 

39:48.720 --> 39:54.080
Suspected of conspiring with Thomas Grey and you against the Lord Protector. 

39:54.080 --> 39:57.320
- My God. What about Thomas? 
- He got away. 

39:59.080 --> 40:03.440
Your Grace, it would help Anthony very much 

40:03.440 --> 40:06.120
if you complied with Richard's demands. 

40:16.920 --> 40:18.680
I will return tomorrow. 

40:20.400 --> 40:23.440
Let's hope there is some change in his condition. 

40:29.320 --> 40:31.360
(Richard, stay down, stay covered.) 

40:41.640 --> 40:44.160
We must get you out of here, tonight. 

40:44.160 --> 40:47.080
You and Thomas Grey. 

40:47.080 --> 40:49.680
We must find a boy that's the very image of you. 

40:49.680 --> 40:53.080
Mother. To defy Richard now would be to put us all at risk. 

40:53.080 --> 40:54.760
Don't you see? 

40:54.760 --> 40:57.960
Richard can do whatever he wants, whether we comply or not. 

40:57.960 --> 41:00.320
He can keep dishonouring us. 

41:00.320 --> 41:03.720
He can keep your brother out of sight and rule through him. 

41:03.720 --> 41:06.520
I have a chance of saving my son and I must take it. 

41:50.200 --> 41:52.280
"Lady Margaret, I need your help. 

41:53.280 --> 41:56.880
"I am grateful for your loyalty, but now we must act." 

42:05.440 --> 42:08.520
You are doing a great service for the King. 

42:08.520 --> 42:10.240
Let's get you a bed, Geoffrey. 

42:23.080 --> 42:26.360
Damn Richard... 

42:29.480 --> 42:32.560
..Duke of Gloucester. 

42:33.640 --> 42:39.160
Damn his sword arm, Lord Protector. 

42:42.560 --> 42:45.240
Husband to a frail wife. 

42:46.760 --> 42:49.640
Father to a sickly heir. 

42:50.840 --> 42:53.280
'He's Lord Protector.' 

42:53.280 --> 42:56.000
He shouldn't have to justify himself to Privy Councillors! 

42:56.000 --> 42:59.200
They wouldn't have liked the way he hauled Anthony Rivers out of bed 

42:59.200 --> 43:01.560
or sent Buckingham to secure the other boy. 

43:01.560 --> 43:04.000
Gives the impression he doesn't care for their counsel. 

43:04.000 --> 43:06.520
You are the Lord Protector. We must put a stop to this. 

43:06.520 --> 43:10.120
I know, Brackenbury. Damned fools, don't they see? Argh! 

43:10.120 --> 43:12.760
- My Lord! 
- Richard? 

43:12.760 --> 43:15.520
- Fetch a physician, Brackenbury! 
- No, no. It'll pass... 

43:15.520 --> 43:19.400
This is her. I can tell. She's cursed you, your sword arm. 

43:19.400 --> 43:23.680
I'm sure it is nothing, Your Grace, it'll pass. 

43:25.880 --> 43:29.920
The Council are demanding Anthony's release, almost to a man. 

43:31.600 --> 43:34.200
I cannot reason with these people. 

43:34.200 --> 43:36.280
I do not even know if I can trust them. 

43:39.320 --> 43:41.640
If they support him, they're against you. 

43:41.640 --> 43:44.640
They could be plotting in there as we speak. 

43:47.640 --> 43:51.640
There are too many men having their say in matters of security 

43:51.640 --> 43:53.400
and Prince Edward's future. 

44:01.520 --> 44:03.480
Root out the traitors. 

44:04.560 --> 44:08.120
ELIZABETH: 'We must free Prince Edward from the Tower. 

44:08.120 --> 44:11.840
'I fear Richard will only use my son to further his ambitions.' 

44:14.920 --> 44:17.240
Stand aside. Men, follow me. Follow me. 

44:21.840 --> 44:25.080
Secure the door. Seek out any evidence of treason. 

44:25.080 --> 44:27.720
What is the meaning of this? 

44:27.720 --> 44:32.160
Lord Stanley's under house arrest, we're to search his papers. 

44:32.160 --> 44:35.040
- Chambers. 
- This is absurd! To what end? 

44:35.040 --> 44:36.960
With me. 

44:36.960 --> 44:40.080
Richard suspects the Council has been plotting with the Queen 

44:40.080 --> 44:41.440
and Anthony Rivers. 

44:41.440 --> 44:44.320
My husband is an ally of Richard's. 

44:44.320 --> 44:47.320
This is, this is how he treats his friends? 

44:47.320 --> 44:51.160
- These are my possessions. 
- Let them look. We've nothing to hide. 

44:52.880 --> 44:55.760
Please. They're sacred items. They're delicate. 

45:01.960 --> 45:04.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa. 

45:04.000 --> 45:06.440
That Bible is consecrated. 

45:07.440 --> 45:09.640
The only other person to have held it 

45:09.640 --> 45:12.080
is His Holiness himself, the Pope. 

45:35.760 --> 45:37.800
Thank you, Sir Robert. 

45:44.680 --> 45:47.480
Lord Stanley. 

45:47.480 --> 45:51.040
I could find no evidence that you took part in this conspiracy. 

45:51.040 --> 45:53.160
Of course you couldn't. 

45:57.760 --> 46:01.320
My apologies, Lady Margaret. 

46:01.320 --> 46:03.320
Men! 

46:09.600 --> 46:11.640
Oh, my God! 

46:18.480 --> 46:20.640
Were any charges brought? 

46:20.640 --> 46:22.360
Thankfully, not against you. 

46:24.760 --> 46:26.880
Would you mind helping me? 

46:26.880 --> 46:30.920
It's a sensitive matter and Richard's asked for complete discretion. 

46:33.280 --> 46:40.040
I'd do anything to help the Duke, not least to prove my loyalty. 

46:41.080 --> 46:45.920
- Still? 
- You wouldn't? 

46:49.200 --> 46:52.400
He's just shown he's willing to act of his own accord. 

46:53.840 --> 46:56.760
There's no questioning him. We must all do as he says. 

46:58.880 --> 47:02.720
I worry what he might do tomorrow, 

47:02.720 --> 47:06.440
after he has crowned the boy and is confirmed as Lord Protector. 

47:16.840 --> 47:20.760
Stanley. Lord Buckingham. 

47:27.960 --> 47:31.000
Tell your brother I'll be thinking of him. 

47:32.320 --> 47:34.320
As we all will, Your Grace. 

47:42.960 --> 47:44.920
Come, child. 

47:50.760 --> 47:53.520
Do you really think people will believe he is Richard? 

47:53.520 --> 47:56.120
At least it will buy some time to get our boy away. 

47:56.120 --> 47:59.160
If you didn't think it was safe for Prince Richard to go to the Tower 

47:59.160 --> 48:01.080
then you must believe Edward's at risk too. 

48:03.720 --> 48:07.680
When he sees Geoffrey, realises what's happened, he'll fear for his life. 

48:07.680 --> 48:10.000
He will know I had no choice, 

48:10.000 --> 48:12.720
that I'll be trying to get him out of there. 

48:12.720 --> 48:16.360
- The boy has instructions. 
- Tell Uncle Richard he can be Lord Protector. 

48:16.360 --> 48:18.760
That you'll give up wanting your "Rivers King". 

48:18.760 --> 48:22.520
Never. We must protect the throne and I don't trust your uncle to do what's right now. 

48:22.520 --> 48:27.040
- Mother, please, try to see reason. 
- Why did he want both sons? 

48:27.040 --> 48:30.320
He knows that if you have the heirs, you hold all the power. 

48:42.560 --> 48:45.880
There. Your brother has come to see you crowned. 

48:46.960 --> 48:49.560
I would often share with your father. 

48:49.560 --> 48:53.640
He would tell me great stories, of battles and great warriors. 

48:53.640 --> 48:57.960
But would be ashamed of you if he saw how you were treating his sons. 

48:57.960 --> 49:01.200
- Richard, how are you? 
- Well, Your Grace. 

49:01.200 --> 49:04.320
I'm not yet King, brother, call me Edward. 

49:04.320 --> 49:06.760
You'll be crowned in the morning. 

49:22.000 --> 49:25.000
How can you crown a boy who'd grow up to be your enemy? 

49:25.000 --> 49:28.840
What would you have me do, Anne? Not make him King? 

49:28.840 --> 49:31.600
Take the throne for myself? 

49:34.160 --> 49:37.120
I have to get the coronation over with. 

49:37.120 --> 49:40.000
Swear the boy in so I'm Lord Protector and no other. 

49:41.400 --> 49:44.360
As King, he'll always be looking to Anthony Rivers, 

49:44.360 --> 49:47.280
- the man who raised him. 
- And his mother. 

49:47.280 --> 49:51.320
Crown him, and you will be signing your own death warrant, 

49:51.320 --> 49:53.360
putting us at risk, too. 

49:54.840 --> 49:58.800
Name yourself King, it is the safest option now. 

50:02.000 --> 50:04.320
Finally, 

50:04.320 --> 50:08.040
someone who is not afraid of saying what we're all thinking. 

50:08.040 --> 50:11.280
I worry how that might look, my Lord. 

50:13.000 --> 50:15.560
I can't be seen to be stealing the throne, 

50:15.560 --> 50:18.760
- the people would not allow it. 
- The people only want peace. 

50:19.840 --> 50:22.960
They know how risky it is to have a young king. 

50:22.960 --> 50:26.600
- You wouldn't be stealing anything. 
- Enough, Mother. 
- They know. 

50:28.040 --> 50:30.120
Edward was wed before. 

50:30.120 --> 50:33.360
His marriage to Elizabeth was never legitimate. 

50:34.440 --> 50:36.960
I never thought there was any truth in those rumours. 

50:39.480 --> 50:42.880
I know of at least one ceremony performed in secret 

50:42.880 --> 50:45.040
so he could bed a woman. 

50:45.040 --> 50:46.960
He has bastards all over England. 

50:46.960 --> 50:48.680
Then you must crown yourself, 

50:48.680 --> 50:51.120
for those boys in the Tower are not entitled! 

50:51.120 --> 50:55.160
Neither am I. And I wouldn't be King in the eyes of God. 

50:55.160 --> 50:59.560
God knows you'd only be doing it to stop a commoner from being crowned, 

50:59.560 --> 51:01.640
a witch from reigning. 

51:02.720 --> 51:05.440
You'd be totally justified and sanctified. 

51:22.600 --> 51:24.640
Convene Parliament. 

51:35.280 --> 51:39.840
I'll warn Henry he's no longer preparing to face a young king, but Richard. 

51:39.840 --> 51:43.480
- Is Buckingham with us? 
- As much as he ever will be. 

51:43.480 --> 51:45.040
His claim is as strong as your son's. 

51:45.040 --> 51:48.680
Well then, Henry must strengthen his claim. Marry well. 

51:48.680 --> 51:50.240
Princess Elizabeth. 

51:50.240 --> 51:53.680
Her mother stands to lose everything now. She'll be open to the match. 

51:53.680 --> 51:56.400
And Henry could call upon her support fighting for the throne. 

51:56.400 --> 52:00.520
That's for later. For now we have to convince her 

52:00.520 --> 52:03.800
we're working with her to get the princes out of the Tower. 

52:35.720 --> 52:37.760
Your Grace. 

52:39.760 --> 52:42.480
I'm Doctor Lewis, Lady Margaret Stanley's physician. 

52:42.480 --> 52:46.440
Forgive the plague mask, I needed a disguise to bypass the guards. 

52:47.640 --> 52:50.240
Grave news, Your Grace. 

52:50.240 --> 52:53.480
Richard, Duke of Gloucester plans to make himself King. 

52:53.480 --> 52:56.200
Parliament declared your marriage to Edward of York invalid 

52:56.200 --> 53:01.440
- and your sons as bastards. 
- What? No. He can't. Mother? 

53:04.000 --> 53:05.840
Lady Margaret is cutting us too? 

53:05.840 --> 53:09.080
On the contrary, she's on your side, as is her husband. 

53:09.080 --> 53:11.840
They believe Richard has acted unlawfully 

53:11.840 --> 53:14.720
and they fear for the safety of your sons. 

53:22.520 --> 53:26.040
You got my letter explaining everything? 

53:26.040 --> 53:28.680
That I played no part in any betrayal? 

53:28.680 --> 53:31.840
We could've raised Prince Edward together. 

53:31.840 --> 53:34.000
I'm no threat. 

53:35.640 --> 53:41.280
I know that if I crown him, he'd only take your counsel 

53:41.280 --> 53:43.600
and I cannot trust you. 

53:43.600 --> 53:50.000
You can. You have no proof of any betrayal! 

53:51.240 --> 53:55.800
- You can't do this to me! 
- Richard, please! 

53:55.800 --> 53:59.240
- I've done nothing wrong! 
- Richard, please. 

54:03.880 --> 54:07.920
I am Your Grace, King to be. 

54:10.520 --> 54:12.920
Though you will never see me crowned. 

54:14.840 --> 54:17.280
Spare Richard Grey. 

54:19.000 --> 54:21.400
Think about this, what you're doing! 

54:38.120 --> 54:45.800
- Lizzie? What's wrong? 
- You'll never give up, will you? 

54:46.800 --> 54:50.160
Your ambition will be the death of the boys 

54:50.160 --> 54:54.160
and when they're all gone, you'll put me on the throne. 

54:54.160 --> 54:56.760
You love the crown more than us. 

54:56.760 --> 54:59.520
I don't. You can't know such a thing. 

54:59.520 --> 55:03.520
Yes, I can. You know that I... 

55:05.160 --> 55:07.880
You've had a seeing. 

55:09.400 --> 55:11.440
What did you see? 

55:15.040 --> 55:17.080
Is it Anthony? 

55:18.200 --> 55:21.760
- Richard Grey? 
- I'm sorry, Mother. I'm sorry. 

55:21.760 --> 55:23.760
I'm sorry. 

55:45.160 --> 55:49.280
'My life was lent me to one intent. 

55:54.640 --> 55:57.360
'It is nigh spent. 

55:57.360 --> 56:00.000
'Welcome, fortune!' 

56:29.840 --> 56:31.720
'We'll stay in sanctuary for now.' 

56:33.240 --> 56:35.600
But we'll come out to our true place. 

56:37.960 --> 56:41.320
Call it the curse of ambition 

56:41.320 --> 56:44.000
but I only want for you. 

56:45.840 --> 56:49.640
I will restore your good names and get my boys back. 

56:53.280 --> 56:55.560
I will not stop until it's done.
