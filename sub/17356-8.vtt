with just a tube

- WOMAN: [on TV] [screams]

00:16.751 --> 00:17.750
- BARB:
Oh!

00:17.752 --> 00:19.752
We're eating cupcakes
while watching cupcakes.

00:19.754 --> 00:23.188
- That's called winning
the game of life, honey.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.492
- Oh, hey, kids.
Do you want some cupcakes?

00:26.494 --> 00:27.559
- Put those away.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.394
Max and I
gave up desserts

00:28.396 --> 00:30.763
in order to get in peak physical
form to make the Z Force.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.498
- They don't want cupcakes?

00:32.500 --> 00:35.634
Is it too late to
have more kids?

00:36.771 --> 00:38.704
- Yes!

00:38.706 --> 00:43.342
- Why would we need cupcakes
when we've got rice cakes?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.744
- BOTH:
[chomping]

00:49.717 --> 00:51.784

- Thundermans, I have a very
special assignment for Max.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.361
- For Max?

01:02.363 --> 01:04.129
What, are you guys
testing out

01:04.131 --> 01:07.166
some new sort of
super hairspray?

01:07.168 --> 01:09.201
- We'd like you to speak
to some troubled youths

01:09.203 --> 01:11.770
at the Metroburg Juvenile
Detention Center.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.806
- Oh, Max, remember that
summer you spent there

01:13.808 --> 01:15.674
while the rest of us--
- BARB: Unh-unh.

01:15.676 --> 01:20.379
- --didn't go on
vacation to Hawaii?

01:20.381 --> 01:22.247
- You guys went where?

01:22.249 --> 01:24.850
- President Kickbutt
is talking.

01:25.252 --> 01:26.552
- As a reformed supervillain,

01:26.554 --> 01:28.454
we think you'd be
a perfect role model

01:28.456 --> 01:32.124
to help the kids
turn over a new cape.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.859
- Me? A role model?

01:33.861 --> 01:36.128
I mean, fashion model, sure.

01:36.130 --> 01:40.232
- [camera shutter clicks]
- No filter needed.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.103
- Are you going
to do it or not?

01:44.105 --> 01:45.137
- Uh...yeah, I'll do it.

01:45.139 --> 01:49.274
But only if they name a sandwich
after me in the cafeteria.

01:49.276 --> 01:53.345
- Fine. You can have
the chopped liver and onions.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.447
- Yes!

01:55.449 --> 01:58.684
- Super President Kickbutt,
out!

01:58.686 --> 01:59.651
- [sighs, laughs]

02:03.424 --> 02:05.324
[chuckles]
Every time they puke,

02:05.326 --> 02:07.659
they'll think of this guy.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.229
- Well, what do you think
about that, Barb?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.798
Max is goin' back
to super juvie.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.732
- Yeah.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.301
This time we can
tell people about it.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.604
- This is so much better than
the last time I was there.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.472
I mean, the only people
they had come talk to us

02:20.474 --> 02:21.707
were a couple of lame supes.

02:21.709 --> 02:25.544
- Didn't they send Mom and Dad?
- Yeah, it was the worst.

02:26.714 --> 02:31.216
- ¶

02:31.218 --> 02:34.319
- Nora, there's bedbugs

Kids, pack your bags!
We're moving!

02:49.503 --> 02:50.669
- HANK:

02:50.671 --> 02:52.204
Evil Super Cockroach
is back?

02:52.206 --> 02:56.575
You ate my sidekick,
but you won't eat my family!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.311
- We're just playing
Super Bug Blitz.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.747
Can you just
stop being old?

03:03.284 --> 03:04.449
- I knew that.

03:04.451 --> 03:06.885
Stop being so old, Barb.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.786
- Kids, look at this mess.

03:07.788 --> 03:11.223
You can't tear up the whole
house for a video game.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.758
- We didn't tear up
the whole house.

03:12.760 --> 03:15.227
- Yeah, we haven't even
been near the bathroom.

03:15.229 --> 03:17.629

The bathroom!

Take that, spider!
- Look at Chloe.

Where'd you get
that phone?

- 'Cause for the past
20 minutes,

03:49.463 --> 03:51.797
you've been screaming
"Phoebe-e-e!"

03:51.799 --> 03:54.967
- Well, since you're here,
do you mind cutting my nails?

03:54.969 --> 03:56.668
They could use a trim.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.904
- Ugh! No, I'm not
touching those.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.806
- Then I'll just do this.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.274
- [nails screeching]

04:02.276 --> 04:03.542
- Okay! Okay! Okay!
I'll cut them.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.578
- I just need them short enough
so I can hit that button.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.814
- PHOEBE: "Top Secret Party."
Colosso, what is this?

04:08.816 --> 04:12.751
- Don't touch it.
You're not invited.

04:13.420 --> 04:16.521
- [triumphant music plays]

04:18.292 --> 04:21.727
- You made a "Welcome Back To
Being Evil" banner for Max?

04:21.729 --> 04:25.364
- That banner could
be for anybody.

04:25.366 --> 04:28.500
- [triumphant music plays]

04:29.436 --> 04:31.903
- What makes you think he's
gonna go back to being evil?

04:31.905 --> 04:33.872
- Hanging with those
pint-sized villains today

04:33.874 --> 04:37.909
will remind him how much fun
it was to be a bad guy.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.980
You know, before you
ruined him?

04:41.982 --> 04:43.715
- Aren't you
a pint-sized villain?

04:43.717 --> 04:46.318
- I'm fun-sized.
It's different.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.389
The point is he'll be back
to the old Max in no time.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.857
- No way.
Max gave up evil.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.859
When Max gives something up,
it's for good.

04:53.861 --> 04:55.761
- Oh, like he gave
up sweets?

04:55.763 --> 04:59.631
Well, feast your eyes on
the security monitors.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.069
- [typing on keyboard]

05:04.071 --> 05:06.004
- COLOSSO: This was
taken this morning,

05:06.006 --> 05:08.740
before he left for Metroburg.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.709
- PHOEBE:
What? Uh...

05:10.711 --> 05:11.610
It can't be.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.746
- And look what
happens next.

05:14.748 --> 05:17.716
- Oh, come--
no, Max, not the trash.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.550
No, don't eat it.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.853
What the--
Don't! Don't! Aww...

05:21.855 --> 05:25.090
How am I the single one?

05:25.092 --> 05:25.757
- Told ya.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.025
He couldn't resist
those cupcakes.

05:27.027 --> 05:31.330
And he won't be able to
resist being evil again.

05:31.332 --> 05:32.064
- I guess I was wrong.

05:32.066 --> 05:35.867
- Heh. Maybe you should push
that button one more time.

05:38.038 --> 05:41.073
- [foghorn blasting]

05:41.075 --> 05:43.775
- [laughs]
You were wrong.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.578
[laughter continues]

05:46.580 --> 05:48.680
- ¶

05:48.682 --> 05:49.748
¶ What you see ¶

05:49.750 --> 05:50.949
¶ Is not what you get ¶

05:50.951 --> 05:54.619
¶ Livin' our lives
with a secret ¶

05:54.621 --> 05:56.088
¶ We fit right in ¶

05:56.090 --> 05:57.522
¶ Bet you never guessed ¶

05:57.524 --> 05:59.057
¶ 'Cause we're
livin' our lives ¶

05:59.059 --> 06:00.792
¶ Just like all the rest ¶

06:00.794 --> 06:02.661
¶ A picture
perfect family ¶

06:02.663 --> 06:04.563
¶ Is what we try to be ¶

06:04.565 --> 06:05.897
¶ Look closer,
you might see ¶

06:05.899 --> 06:07.599
¶ The crazy things we do ¶

06:07.601 --> 06:09.534
¶ This isn't
make believe ¶

06:09.536 --> 06:10.936
¶ It's our reality ¶

06:10.938 --> 06:12.070
¶ Just your average family ¶

06:12.072 --> 06:15.674
¶ Trying to be normal
and stay out of trouble ¶

06:15.676 --> 06:19.945
¶ Livin' a double life ¶¶

06:22.616 --> 06:26.852
- ¶

06:26.854 --> 06:28.854
- MAX: Hey.
- [chuckles]

06:28.856 --> 06:30.756
Little Max Thunderman.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.624
As I live and breathe.
- MAX: [chuckles]

06:32.626 --> 06:36.895
Officer Bosco!
- BOTH: [laugh]

06:36.897 --> 06:39.531
- Ooh, I still can't believe
you're the same boy

06:39.533 --> 06:41.633
who started
the puddin' rebellion.

06:41.635 --> 06:42.601
Uh, what was that slogan?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.503
- "We're not puddin'
up with this."

06:44.505 --> 06:46.037
- BOTH: [laugh]
- That's the one.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.038
- Ha!
- [laughs]

06:47.040 --> 06:48.707
You'd better
be careful in there.

06:48.709 --> 06:52.144
This crop of delinquents
is as bad as they come.

06:52.146 --> 06:52.878
- Not for long.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.046
I'm here to be a good
influence on them.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.047
Ugh.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.749
It feels weird to say
that out loud.

06:57.751 --> 07:01.553
- The kids are right through
that thundertanium door.

07:01.555 --> 07:02.220
- [metal clanking]

07:02.222 --> 07:03.989
- We had to upgrade
the security systems

07:03.991 --> 07:07.025
since somebody escaped
three times.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.659
- Ah...

07:07.661 --> 07:10.162
I was so good at being bad.
- [chuckles]

07:10.164 --> 07:13.899
Well, now, nobody gets in
or out without my knowing.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.067
- [beep]
- Hey, there.

07:16.069 --> 07:17.936
- Oh! What the--

07:17.938 --> 07:19.938
How'd you get
past the security system?

07:19.940 --> 07:21.807
- Oh, I'm the official
Hero League protector.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.776
I have access to every
code in Metroburg.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.511
It's a perk.

07:26.513 --> 07:28.013
I also give free jelly jams.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.948
- Ooh, I like you.

07:30.117 --> 07:31.249
- Phoebe, what are
you doing here?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.884
- Well, President Kickbutt
wanted me

07:32.886 --> 07:34.219
to come watch you
change some lives.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.854
I don't mind. Do you?
'Cause she didn't mind.

07:35.856 --> 07:38.523
Do you mind?
- I don't mind.

07:38.525 --> 07:39.658
- I have my talk
all planned out.

07:39.660 --> 07:43.094
And you can't be here, throwing
around your pointy elbows.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.229
- Look, don't make
her leave.

07:44.231 --> 07:45.997
She might take
the jelly jams.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.899
You want one?
- PHOEBE: [laughs]

07:47.901 --> 07:50.235
Max wouldn't eat those.
He's given up sweets.

07:50.237 --> 07:53.205
And when he gives
something up, it's for good.

07:53.207 --> 07:54.806
Right, Max?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.576
- Back up. Why are
you so close to me?

07:57.578 --> 07:58.343
- Before you go in there,

07:58.345 --> 08:00.078
you've gotta put on
these power zappers.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.281
No superpowers allowed
in the detention center.

08:03.283 --> 08:04.115
- Wait.

08:04.117 --> 08:07.319
There's something very
important I need to do first.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.888
[powers whooshing]
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

08:09.890 --> 08:11.923
- [laughs]
Classic Max.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.825
- Ha ha!
I knew you'd like that.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.560
- BOSCO:
[laughs]

08:15.562 --> 08:18.263
- ¶

08:18.265 --> 08:20.999
- President Kickbutt,
our phones are missing.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.100
- Send in the Z Force.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.603
- The Z Force is at
the center of the Earth

08:24.605 --> 08:27.205
fighting a giant
radioactive worm.

08:27.207 --> 08:30.942
- Good! They're not busy.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.143
- I am.

08:32.145 --> 08:34.713
Stop calling me.

08:34.882 --> 08:37.849
- Kids, we have
your phones.

08:37.851 --> 08:38.650
- Oh, good.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.253
We'd better warm up
our squishing fingers.

08:41.255 --> 08:44.189
- Ow! Cramp.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.891
- Kids, we took your
phones away

08:45.893 --> 08:47.692
because you were
destroying the house.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.628
You guys need a break
from technology.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.695
- When your mother
and I were kids,

08:50.697 --> 08:54.132
we used to play a little
game called "go outside."

08:54.134 --> 08:54.966
- Yeah.

08:54.968 --> 08:57.903
- We play "Go Outside."
It's an app.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.271
On our phones.

08:59.273 --> 09:02.807
- Every ten minutes, it charges
both of your credit cards.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.843
It's so fun.

09:05.779 --> 09:08.046
- No, we actually
played outside--

09:08.048 --> 09:10.682
real games,
like pick up sticks.

09:10.684 --> 09:11.883
- Paint the sticks.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.885
- Kick the sticks.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.255
It was a lot of
stick-based games.

09:17.257 --> 09:20.158
- How old are you guys?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.294
- Outside.
- Mm-hmm.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.662
- Fine.
Come on, Nora.

09:23.664 --> 09:27.198
I think the outside
is that way?

09:29.937 --> 09:32.404
- [door buzzes]

09:32.406 --> 09:33.805
- All right...

09:33.807 --> 09:39.244
time to meet Metroburg's
worst of the worst.

09:40.647 --> 09:43.348
This is T-Bone.
He has magnet powers.

09:43.350 --> 09:47.252
- I'm also a babe magnet.

09:47.254 --> 09:48.386
- Child, sit down.

09:48.388 --> 09:51.723
- This is Gale Force.
She's a human wind tunnel.

09:51.725 --> 09:55.694
- That's right.
I blow a mighty wind.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.729
- From which end?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.931
- Wanna find out?

10:01.234 --> 10:03.835
- This little one,
they call Maisy.

10:03.837 --> 10:06.705
And we don't talk
about her power.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.340
- Hello, Phoebe.

10:08.342 --> 10:10.709
- How does she
know my name?

10:10.711 --> 10:13.979
- You're gonna be great.
[chuckles]

10:13.981 --> 10:15.146
You're gonna be great.

10:15.148 --> 10:17.916
[chuckles]
Release the monsters.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.919
- [force field hums]

10:21.855 --> 10:24.089
- Time to be an inspiration.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.324
Sit down, delinquents!

10:27.227 --> 10:30.962
- Where do you want me to go?
- Away. You're ruining my flow.

10:31.865 --> 10:36.001
So, you little wannabes
think being bad is cool?

10:36.003 --> 10:37.068
[scoffs]

10:37.070 --> 10:39.237
Well, it's not!

10:39.406 --> 10:42.273
- How would you
know, buttface?

10:42.275 --> 10:45.343
- It's "Mr. Buttface,"
to you.

10:46.279 --> 10:49.781
And I used to be evil,
just like you.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.016
- You? Evil?

10:51.018 --> 10:52.317
What's the worst thing
you've ever done?

10:52.319 --> 10:56.421
- Remember that news anchor that
got punched by the kangaroo?

10:56.423 --> 10:59.891
- Everybody knows Punchy.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.427
- Well, I trained him.
[laughs]

11:02.429 --> 11:04.295
Yeah, they tried to
turn Punchy good again,

11:04.297 --> 11:09.367
but once you made an anchorman
cry, there's no going back.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.437
- Then you turned good.
Right, Max?

11:12.439 --> 11:15.440
- Why'd you bring
your mom?

11:15.442 --> 11:18.843
- We are twins.

11:18.845 --> 11:21.446
- Sit down and stop riling
up the juvies, Mom.

11:21.448 --> 11:23.314
- Yeah!
- Burn!

11:23.316 --> 11:26.284
- I know where you sleep.

11:26.787 --> 11:31.356
- The point is you are
never too evil to change,

11:31.358 --> 11:33.058
no matter what you've done.

11:33.060 --> 11:35.293
- Well, uh, I destroyed
a whole city

11:35.295 --> 11:37.862
with a tornado
made of corn--

11:37.864 --> 11:40.131
a cornado.

11:42.102 --> 11:42.801
- Okay.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.937
Uh, thanks for sharing.
[chuckles nervously]

11:45.939 --> 11:47.172
You...

11:47.174 --> 11:50.942
might be in
your forever home.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.277
What about you, T-Bone?

11:52.279 --> 11:56.081
- I dropped a satellite
on my gym teacher's car.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.150
You tackle that,
Coach Kelly!

12:00.954 --> 12:03.021
- Please. Heh!
That stuff's not that bad.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.825
You know, I once tried to take
over the world with, uh...

12:06.827 --> 12:08.860
[chuckles]
...Dark Mayhem.

12:08.862 --> 12:10.028
- KIDS:
[gasping]

12:10.030 --> 12:12.230
- You know Dark Mayhem?
- Know him?

12:12.232 --> 12:14.799
I was almost his plus-one
at the Villain Awards.

12:14.801 --> 12:17.268
- Okay, let's not forget to
tell them about the time

12:17.270 --> 12:20.972
you helped me take
down Dark Mayhem--

12:20.974 --> 12:22.474
'cause you're not
evil anymore.

12:22.476 --> 12:24.509
Remember that part, Max?

12:24.511 --> 12:25.443
- Wait.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.946
You took down
Dark Mayhem, too?

12:27.948 --> 12:29.314
- I don't wanna
brag, but...

12:29.316 --> 12:32.984
I gained his trust
and stabbed him in the back.

12:32.986 --> 12:33.818
- Wow.

12:33.820 --> 12:37.889
Bosco, bring me
a Max Thunderman sandwich!

12:37.891 --> 12:40.992
- BOSCO:
Get your own sandwich!

12:40.994 --> 12:44.129
- ¶

12:44.131 --> 12:46.865
- Woo!

12:46.867 --> 12:47.432
- Aw, Hank!

12:47.434 --> 12:50.401
The kids are having so much
fun without their phones.

12:50.403 --> 12:54.005
- Is it possible to be
too good at parenting?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.206
- BARB:
[laughs]

12:55.208 --> 12:56.841
- Oh, we should
reward ourselves

12:56.843 --> 12:58.176
with the "Cupcake Island"
finale.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.278
- Yeah. I have to see
if Tristan can beat Bryce

13:00.280 --> 13:04.315
after that gator took
his baking hat.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.018
Hank!

13:07.020 --> 13:07.619
The TV's gone!

13:07.621 --> 13:11.422
- What kind of filthy, no-good
loser would steal our TV?

13:11.424 --> 13:14.159
- These losers.

13:14.161 --> 13:14.659
- What?

13:14.661 --> 13:15.994
- We realized
you guys were right.

13:15.996 --> 13:19.264
We've all been spending too much
time staring at screens.

13:19.266 --> 13:23.301
- So we made
the TVs go bye-bye.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.070
- Um, kids, we...
we appreciate the thought.

13:26.072 --> 13:29.040
But we're about to watch
our show's big finale.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.308
- It is very important

13:30.310 --> 13:32.911
we find out who gets
off Cupcake Island.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.614
- Maybe you could fly there--
on "Twig" Town Airlines.

13:37.584 --> 13:41.119
- Sorry we can't
"stick" around.

13:41.121 --> 13:43.388
- You'll need these.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.259
- Sticks?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.093
Barb, I wanna watch

13:49.095 --> 13:52.197
America's number-one
dessert-themed reality show.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.132
- Maybe we should
take our own advice

13:54.134 --> 13:55.366
and take a break
from our devices.

13:55.368 --> 13:58.403
- Yeah, I mean, I guess
we don't need to see Bryce win.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.071
- No, it's gonna
be Tristan.

14:00.073 --> 14:01.272
- Bryce!
- Tristan!

14:01.274 --> 14:04.375
- BOTH: We have
to find the TV!

14:05.345 --> 14:07.946
- Then I took control of
Tech Rider's super cycle,

14:07.948 --> 14:11.049
and almost drove my sister
straight off a cliff!

14:11.051 --> 14:11.516
[laughs]

14:11.518 --> 14:15.119
Dr. Colosso and I laughed
about that one for weeks.

14:15.956 --> 14:19.624
- You used to be
so awesome, Mr. Buttface.

14:19.626 --> 14:22.493
- Yeah. Why did
you turn good?

14:22.495 --> 14:25.363
- Because I...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.966
I don't know.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.401
- Well, Max, you turned good
because you love your family.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.438
And deep down, he was really
good the whole time.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.074
- No, that's not it.

14:37.277 --> 14:38.643
- Uh, I have an idea.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.946
Why don't we write
down all the things

14:41.948 --> 14:43.514
we love about
being good, huh?

14:43.516 --> 14:48.119
Here. For instance,
I love flossing twice a day

14:48.121 --> 14:52.223
and having a brother
I can totally trust.

14:52.225 --> 14:54.192
- Wait, everyone stop.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.693
Give me those pens.

14:55.695 --> 14:58.263
Phoebe, I need to talk
to you immediately.

14:58.265 --> 15:02.700
- [chuckles]
¶ His mom's in trouble ¶

15:03.270 --> 15:06.304
- Will you cut it out so I can
change their stupid lives?

15:06.306 --> 15:07.972
- I'm just trying
to help you.

15:07.974 --> 15:09.307
- They're villains.
If you give them pens,

15:09.309 --> 15:11.542
they're gonna use them to
pry off their power zappers.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.279
- I think you're
overreacting.

15:14.281 --> 15:17.982
Wait, why is one of
those pens a straw?

15:17.984 --> 15:19.417
- Because I switched it.

15:19.419 --> 15:21.519
- [zapping]

15:24.424 --> 15:27.992
- Now we're gonna
teach you a lesson.

15:27.994 --> 15:28.693
- [wind gust]

15:28.695 --> 15:31.296
- MAX & PHOEBE:
[thudding]

15:31.298 --> 15:33.631
- [powers zapping]

15:33.633 --> 15:36.367
- I think I'm gettin'
through to 'em.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.342
- ¶

15:44.344 --> 15:46.778
- You kids are being
very rude right now.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.579
Just putting
that out there.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.249
- Shut your stupid trap.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.252
- You guys better let us
out of here or else!

15:54.254 --> 15:55.753
- Or else what?

15:55.755 --> 15:57.188
- Or else...

15:57.190 --> 16:00.258
I'm gonna repeat
my request to be released.

16:00.427 --> 16:03.761
- If the Hero League ever wants
to see either of you again,

16:03.763 --> 16:06.331
they're gonna have
to agree to our demands.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.733
- What have we got
so far, T-Bone?

16:08.735 --> 16:12.236
- Uh, a picture of me
in a silly hat.

16:12.238 --> 16:14.605
Man, I miss hats.

16:15.508 --> 16:16.841
- What was President Kickbutt

16:16.843 --> 16:19.510
thinking, sending
you down here today?

16:19.512 --> 16:20.278
- ¶ We-e-e-e-ll... ¶

16:20.280 --> 16:24.849
she didn't send me so much
as I made the whole thing up.

16:24.851 --> 16:27.118
- What? Then why'd
you come down here?

16:27.120 --> 16:28.486
- ¶ We-e-e-e-ll... ¶

16:28.488 --> 16:30.555
- Just say it.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.857
- Because this is the first
time you've spent any time

16:32.859 --> 16:36.127
with villains since
you stopped being evil.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.563
I was afraid that being
around these kids

16:38.565 --> 16:40.431
might bring out
the old Max.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.533
- So...you think
I'd just go back

16:42.535 --> 16:44.202
to be evil,
just like that?

16:44.204 --> 16:46.404
- No, I just meant--
- No, I get it.

16:46.406 --> 16:49.273
You think I'll always
be a villain.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.112
And you're right.

16:54.114 --> 16:56.147
- I'm sorry, what?

16:56.149 --> 16:57.815
- People never
really change.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.183
I guess being back
here with them

16:59.185 --> 17:01.285
reminded me of
who I really am.

17:01.287 --> 17:05.390
- A stand-up guy
who loves his family?

17:05.392 --> 17:06.424
- No.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.159
Evil.
[evil chuckle]

17:08.161 --> 17:09.727
Hey, kids!
Let me help you out.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.396
- Come on, Max,
you've worked so hard

17:11.398 --> 17:13.398
to turn your life around--
don't throw it all away.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.832
- You know,
real supervillains

17:14.834 --> 17:17.568
would've busted outta
this joint by now.

17:17.570 --> 17:18.136
- How?

17:18.138 --> 17:20.271
Even with our powers,
we can't break that door down.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.840
- Well, I guess you'll just
have to talk to someone

17:22.842 --> 17:27.845
who has access to every
prison code in Metroburg.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.679
- [clicks tongue]

17:28.681 --> 17:30.681
Good thing there's
no one here like that.

17:30.683 --> 17:32.884
- President Kickbutt gave
my sister all the access codes

17:32.886 --> 17:34.852
back when she was named
protector of Hiddenville.

17:34.854 --> 17:40.224
- Then tell your mom to
get your sister down here.

17:40.226 --> 17:43.428
- I am his sister!

17:44.697 --> 17:46.264
- Give them the code.
- Never!

17:46.266 --> 17:50.635
- I'll break her.
My powers break everyone.

17:52.372 --> 17:55.473
- [powers zapping]
- PHOEBE: [giggling]

17:56.709 --> 17:59.477
- Hyperkinetic
tickle powers?

17:59.479 --> 18:01.345
It's evil and adorable.

18:01.347 --> 18:02.713
- [giggling]

18:02.715 --> 18:04.415
[crying]

18:05.885 --> 18:06.951
- HANK:
[sobbing]

18:06.953 --> 18:08.553
Our TV has to be
here somewhere!

18:08.555 --> 18:11.589
- I'm coming for ya,
"Cupcake Island"!

18:11.591 --> 18:13.558
[roars]
- [couch thuds]

18:13.560 --> 18:16.594
- Whoa, maybe we should
give them back the TV.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.497
- No. This is what we're
waiting for, Billy.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.232
They're cracking.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.233
- Oh, kids!
[laughs]

18:22.235 --> 18:24.902
Listen, uh, your mother
and I think

18:24.904 --> 18:25.903
that we have taught you

18:25.905 --> 18:27.672
a very valuable life
lesson, right, Barb?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.873
- Yep, yep!
You guys learned.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.709
We learned.
Everybody learned.

18:31.711 --> 18:33.945
- Here are your phones.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.847
Now, where is our TV?

18:35.849 --> 18:38.416
- I don't know--
the sticks are pretty fun.

18:38.418 --> 18:40.685
- Give us back our TV!

18:40.687 --> 18:42.386
- Oh, Chloe!

18:42.388 --> 18:43.821
- [whooshing]

18:43.823 --> 18:45.256
- He-he-hey!

18:45.258 --> 18:47.225
I don't think
that's our TV.

18:47.227 --> 18:50.294
- It's all right, Hank,
just take it.

18:50.930 --> 18:51.662
- Billy, look.

18:51.664 --> 18:53.965
They added crickets
to Super Bug Blitz.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.833
- What a time to be alive.

18:55.835 --> 18:56.767
- [digital bugs squishing]

18:56.769 --> 18:58.669
- Look, the kids are back
to their old habits

18:58.671 --> 19:00.872
because we couldn't
give up TV.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.740
Does this mean
we're bad parents?

19:02.742 --> 19:05.409
- No. Watch this.
- [bugs continue squishing]

19:05.411 --> 19:09.747
- Kids, go play with
your phones...outside.

19:11.417 --> 19:11.983
[chuckling]

19:11.985 --> 19:14.619
That is called winning
the game of parenting, honey.

19:14.621 --> 19:17.388
And now to find out who
won "Cupcake Island."

19:17.390 --> 19:18.055
- BARB:
Ooh...

19:18.057 --> 19:21.659
- Tristan won it all, baby!
[whooshing]

19:21.661 --> 19:24.695
- BOTH:
Chloe!

19:24.697 --> 19:26.731
- [sobbing]

19:26.733 --> 19:27.965
- PHOEBE:
[continues giggling]

19:27.967 --> 19:29.834
- Get her pointy elbows,
where she's weak!

19:29.836 --> 19:31.469
- Ow!
[cries]

19:31.471 --> 19:33.437
Okay, okay.
The first number is 3.

19:33.439 --> 19:36.040
Just please stop.
[giggling]

19:36.042 --> 19:38.009
- Come on. Just tell us
the rest of the code.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.312
- Max, why did you have to
go back to being evil?

19:41.314 --> 19:42.013
- Isn't it obvious?

19:42.015 --> 19:43.714
So they'd be distracted
while I do this.

19:43.716 --> 19:46.717
[grunts]
- [electrical zapping]

19:46.719 --> 19:47.985
- [laughs]

19:47.987 --> 19:50.721
- [powers zapping]

19:51.958 --> 19:54.292
[powers zapping]

19:54.928 --> 19:55.927
- [sighs]

19:55.929 --> 19:58.396
Max, I knew you
were good.

19:58.398 --> 19:59.030
Well, now I do.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.299
Before, I thought
you were totally evil.

20:01.301 --> 20:04.468
- Traitor!
- Let's take them down!

20:04.470 --> 20:10.741
- ¶

20:10.743 --> 20:11.642
- All right...

20:11.644 --> 20:13.878
we should get these power
zappers on 'em before...

20:13.880 --> 20:15.880
[giggling]
...they hurt us really bad.

20:15.882 --> 20:18.683
- [powers zapping]
- PHOEBE: What? What?

20:18.685 --> 20:19.917
Why can't I control
my hand?

20:19.919 --> 20:22.820
- T-BONE: 'Cause there's
metal in your watch.

20:22.822 --> 20:25.790
Told you I'm
a babe magnet.

20:27.961 --> 20:29.994
[giggling]

20:29.996 --> 20:31.462
Maisy, stop.

20:31.464 --> 20:35.766
I'm gonna pee my pants.
[giggling]

20:35.768 --> 20:37.635
- Max, now!

20:37.637 --> 20:40.972
- ¶

20:40.974 --> 20:43.908
- All right, one of us
just has to get to her.

20:43.910 --> 20:46.644
- Oh, looks like we're in
for some stormy weather.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.379
- [wind gust]

20:48.381 --> 20:52.483
- ¶

20:52.485 --> 20:54.385
- [heavy thud]

20:54.387 --> 20:55.686
- Max, it's up to you!

20:55.688 --> 20:58.055
- I'm gonna need a push!

20:58.057 --> 21:01.759
- ¶

21:01.761 --> 21:03.694
- [sighs]
Gotcha, windbag!

21:03.696 --> 21:05.062
- That would be funny...

21:05.064 --> 21:07.765
if I didn't just
pee my pants.

21:09.068 --> 21:09.900
- Sorry, kids.

21:09.902 --> 21:12.637
But I told you,
evil doesn't pay.

21:12.639 --> 21:13.137
- Really?

21:13.139 --> 21:15.072
'Cause it was kinda
evil how you tricked us.

21:15.074 --> 21:17.575
- Guys, being a superhero
doesn't mean

21:17.577 --> 21:21.545
you have to be all goody-goody
like my older sister here.

21:21.547 --> 21:24.415
- We are the same age!

21:24.417 --> 21:29.720
- So, we can be superheroes,
but still be cool like you?

21:29.722 --> 21:31.555
- [chuckles]
Exactly.

21:31.557 --> 21:35.593
- All right. I'm in.
- Me, too.

21:36.462 --> 21:38.729
- I'll think about it.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.401
- Hey.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.435
I'm sorry I doubted you.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.437
Should've trusted that
you gave up being evil.

21:46.439 --> 21:47.972
- Yeah, when
Max Thunderman says

21:47.974 --> 21:51.609
he's giving something up,
it's for good.

21:52.578 --> 21:53.711
You know about
the cupcakes, don't you?

21:53.713 --> 21:56.047
- And the garbage cupcakes.
- Awww...

21:56.049 --> 21:56.947
- [door buzzes]

21:56.949 --> 22:00.985
- Oh, I forgot to tell you--
don't hand out any pens.

22:03.990 --> 22:07.758
- ¶

22:10.663 --> 22:26.744
