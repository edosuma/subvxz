WEBVTT

00:10.644 --> 00:11.979
<i>Previously on</i> Nancy Drew...

00:12.080 --> 00:13.581
<i>On my lips right now is a curse</i>

00:13.681 --> 00:15.349
that I will release
the moment that I die.

00:15.449 --> 00:16.950
<i>It will kill Ace</i>

00:17.051 --> 00:18.419
<i>if you ever act upon your
feelings for each other.</i>

00:18.519 --> 00:20.154
I shouldn't have come here.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.522
<i>We are friends,</i>

00:21.622 --> 00:22.890
and those feelings
that you have for me...

00:22.990 --> 00:25.193
I do not share them
and I never will.

00:26.727 --> 00:28.096
Nancy Drew Investigations.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.697
<i>I've got a case for you.</i>

00:29.797 --> 00:32.032
<i>Meet me at the cemetery
at 10:00 p.m.</i>

00:32.133 --> 00:33.834
<i>Come alone.</i>

00:38.206 --> 00:40.508
Where are the bodies?

00:53.487 --> 00:55.623
Eight empty graves.

01:08.702 --> 01:12.740
Find us. Find us. Find us.

01:32.360 --> 01:33.261
Okay.

01:33.361 --> 01:34.528
And then we realized

01:34.628 --> 01:35.963
that we're both standing
on Main Street

01:36.063 --> 01:37.498
at the crack of dawn,
buying you breakfast!

01:37.598 --> 01:38.832
So I loaded his bike in my car...

01:38.932 --> 01:40.401
No, <i>on</i> your car.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.170
I left you that mountain bike
rack when I moved out.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.037
- You need to eat.
- Healthy breakfast.

01:44.172 --> 01:45.606
Thanks, Dads.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.007
Aren't you gonna
be late for work?

01:47.175 --> 01:48.542
No, I'm a small business
consultant now.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.178
You know, I go in
at like a soft 10:00 a.m.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.445
You're not worried
I could be late?

01:51.545 --> 01:52.946
No, you've clearly reorganized

01:53.046 --> 01:54.515
your entire schedule
'cause Jean's out of town,

01:54.615 --> 01:55.683
and her absence made you
suddenly realize

01:55.783 --> 01:56.884
you're an empty-nester.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.786
Oh...

01:58.886 --> 02:01.855
So, how's business
at Horseshoe Bay's

02:01.955 --> 02:03.691
newest detective agency?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.659
Which case was keeping you up?

02:05.759 --> 02:07.195
The lost antique watch?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.329
Ooh, the case
of the missing safe.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.597
The embezzling spouse.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.465
No. Try Chunky.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.201
Whoa! Whoa!
Not cool.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.068
Don't listen to her, bro.
You look great.

02:15.203 --> 02:16.270
Hey.

02:16.370 --> 02:18.406
I was talking
about Chunky the ferret.

02:18.506 --> 02:19.907
Once I find the Velez family's

02:20.007 --> 02:21.209
beloved MIA weasel,

02:21.275 --> 02:23.211
I can finally pay
my overdue electric bill

02:23.277 --> 02:25.379
and make a dent
in the property tax.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.780
This one's due tomorrow.

02:27.948 --> 02:30.050
I work best under time pressure.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.553
Which is maybe
why I haven't solved

02:32.653 --> 02:35.756
the case of the missing bodies
in the last five weeks.

02:35.856 --> 02:37.825
Made a dope
murder board, though.

02:39.059 --> 02:40.294
It's too bad
that the Mystery Caller

02:40.394 --> 02:42.095
just ghosted you after
they gave the phone tip.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.598
Yeah, left me with no
witnesses to the grave robbing.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.768
The missing dead had no
relationship to each other.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.670
Their lives
never even overlapped.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.104
The only thing
they have in common

02:51.239 --> 02:53.441
is that they all died
before the age of 30

02:53.541 --> 02:56.577
and they're buried in the same
section of the graveyard.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.712
I don't even have
a working theory

02:58.812 --> 03:00.681
other than ambitious vandals.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.716
Well, don't be
too hard on yourself.

03:02.816 --> 03:05.486
The new police chief hasn't
figured it out yet either.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.355
Is there any help from
the coroner's office, you know?

03:07.455 --> 03:09.257
'Cause I know Ace works there,
so maybe he could give you

03:09.357 --> 03:11.024
- some tips.
- Yeah, we don't...

03:11.124 --> 03:12.560
What'd I say, what'd I say?

03:12.660 --> 03:14.628
You know what?

03:14.728 --> 03:16.129
We don't have to talk about Ace

03:16.264 --> 03:17.698
if the topic is upsetting.

03:17.798 --> 03:18.966
I'm not upset.

03:19.066 --> 03:20.968
I can talk about
a platonic friend

03:21.068 --> 03:22.403
who I have to keep alive

03:22.503 --> 03:24.272
by never letting him know
that I'm in love with him

03:24.338 --> 03:25.906
so that we don't act
on our feelings for each other

03:26.006 --> 03:27.308
and activate
a secret death curse.

03:27.408 --> 03:29.843
And, to be fair,
that is speculation.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.279
It's not speculation.

03:31.312 --> 03:32.546
I lived it.

03:34.014 --> 03:35.783
Temperance showed me a vision.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.618
On my lips right now

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
<i>is a curse that I will release</i>

03:38.986 --> 03:40.288
<i>the moment that I die.</i>

03:41.389 --> 03:43.491
<i>It will kill Ace if you ever act</i>

03:43.591 --> 03:45.426
<i>upon your feelings
for each other.</i>

03:46.794 --> 03:48.296
So I had to push Ace away.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.597
If he finds out about the curse,

03:49.697 --> 03:50.631
he's gonna try and break it,

03:50.731 --> 03:51.932
and then he'll end up dead.

03:52.032 --> 03:52.766
So there we go.
We talked about it.

03:55.102 --> 03:56.770
Mm, Bess just texted me.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.772
She said,
"Tell Nancy she's late."

03:58.872 --> 04:00.374
Exclamation point.

04:00.474 --> 04:01.809
"And also find out if
she muted my notifications,

04:01.909 --> 04:02.810
but don't tell her
I was asking."

04:02.910 --> 04:03.911
- I did not...
- Ooh.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.313
I did not... I did not mute her.

04:05.379 --> 04:07.981
I just forgot
that we had to meet, so...

04:08.081 --> 04:09.850
- Bye.
- Later!

04:09.950 --> 04:12.853
She totally muted you, dude.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.989
Hello, fellow Horseshoe Baygels.

04:16.089 --> 04:19.893
I'm Bess Marvin,
coming to you live.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.664
As the new director and curator

04:23.764 --> 04:25.165
of the Historical Society,

04:25.333 --> 04:27.200
I've asked some fellow members

04:27.335 --> 04:29.803
of the #HistSo community

04:29.903 --> 04:32.072
to share how excited they are

04:32.172 --> 04:33.807
for the annual Lovers' Vigil

04:33.907 --> 04:36.344
being held here tomorrow night.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.580
Can I see?

04:39.680 --> 04:40.881
And action!

04:40.981 --> 04:43.016
Hi, I'm Nancy Drew

04:43.116 --> 04:45.252
of Nancy Drew Investigations,

04:45.353 --> 04:47.988
and I am just thrilled
to be a sponsor

04:48.088 --> 04:51.024
of the Lover's Vigil and...

04:52.159 --> 04:54.261
<i>Nancy, I saw that weasel
you were looking for.</i>

04:54.362 --> 04:55.896
- You saw him?
<i>- Yeah...</i>

04:55.996 --> 04:57.531
You saw Chunky Velez?

04:57.631 --> 04:58.732
- Sorry.
- Nancy!

04:58.832 --> 05:00.133
As a prelaw student,

05:00.368 --> 05:02.069
I love reviewing
old case records from

05:02.169 --> 05:03.571
the Historical Society.

05:03.671 --> 05:06.206
"Site of the Lovers'
Vigil tomorrow night."

05:06.374 --> 05:07.475
Wait, that's tomorrow?

05:07.575 --> 05:09.076
I have to get started
on catering.

05:09.176 --> 05:10.678
- Action.
- As the coroner's assistant,

05:10.778 --> 05:13.914
I can't wait for
the annual Lovers' Vigil.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.016
- Um...
- Cut, cut.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.385
As a local business owner,

05:17.418 --> 05:18.652
I understand how important

05:18.752 --> 05:20.287
a place like
the Historical Society is.

05:20.388 --> 05:21.389
Hey, Nick. Thanks.

05:21.422 --> 05:23.156
After a devastating disaster

05:23.256 --> 05:24.558
like our recent tsunami,

05:24.658 --> 05:27.060
we need an opportunity
to bond with each other.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.462
Appreciate it.

05:28.562 --> 05:31.699
That's why I'll be
at the Lovers' Vigil

05:31.799 --> 05:33.100
tomorrow night.

05:33.200 --> 05:34.602
<i>Will you be there?</i>

05:34.702 --> 05:35.936
Wow.

05:36.036 --> 05:37.605
A star is born.

05:37.705 --> 05:39.740
I used to do postgame interviews

05:39.840 --> 05:41.008
when I played football.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.743
I guess I forgot
how much I missed it.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.277
- Aw.
- Thank you both

05:44.412 --> 05:46.246
for helping Nancy Drew
Investigations' sponsorship

05:46.414 --> 05:47.748
of the Lovers' Vigil.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.249
You are very welcome.

05:49.417 --> 05:53.687
But what are the chances
that next year's sponsorship

05:53.787 --> 05:56.524
comes in the form of money
and not our free labor?

05:56.624 --> 06:00.093
Well, as long as Chunky Velez
is in the wind, low.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.262
- Great.
- That lead was a bust.

06:02.430 --> 06:03.431
He fled the scene.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.765
His name is Chunky.

06:04.865 --> 06:05.999
How fast can he be?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.335
You'd be surprised.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.937
- Thank you.
- Sure thing.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.872
- Later, Nick.
- Thanks, Tristan.

06:17.177 --> 06:18.646
Hmm!

06:18.746 --> 06:20.914
Hey, you're the town's
most eligible heartthrob now.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.850
Why don't you sponsor
the Lovers' Vigil?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.284
No.

06:24.452 --> 06:25.819
I'm still getting used
to being single again.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.055
And isn't the Vigil
all about reuniting the souls

06:28.155 --> 06:29.289
of long-lost loves?

06:29.457 --> 06:31.358
I'm done with lovers

06:31.459 --> 06:32.493
and their souls
for the time being.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.161
Mmm, well, speak for yourself.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.463
Addy's been out of town,

06:35.496 --> 06:38.599
and I cannot wait
to unite our souls

06:38.699 --> 06:41.268
all over the Historical Society.

06:42.369 --> 06:43.537
Oh, come on. What?

06:43.637 --> 06:46.339
The Keeper's quarters
are too cramped.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.376
Yeah, well,
no need to rub it in.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.344
The rest of us
are lonely enough.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.816
I, uh, I almost
forgot the cider.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.995
Thank you.

07:09.497 --> 07:12.232
Have you spoken to Ace lately?

07:12.332 --> 07:14.602
I'm just giving him space.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.069
Feels like the least I could do

07:16.169 --> 07:17.571
after stomping on his heart.

07:19.907 --> 07:21.141
How is he?

07:21.241 --> 07:23.410
You could ask him yourself.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.513
But I am late.

07:25.546 --> 07:26.747
Me and Nick have
to pick up flowers.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.415
Do you mind holding the fort?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.725
Did you forget something?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.031
Bess told me
to bring these, she said...

07:44.131 --> 07:45.799
you'd be running errands.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.603
I have no errands whatsoever.

07:50.604 --> 07:52.039
Bess <i>Parent Trapped</i> us.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.644
You don't have to talk to me
if you don't want to.

07:56.744 --> 07:58.912
You can just set the box down
and go.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.682
Or you could stay.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.684
See, I don't know
what's right anymore.

08:04.952 --> 08:06.554
I've been trying
to make peace with it all,

08:06.587 --> 08:07.788
but I was so mad at you.

08:07.888 --> 08:08.956
I know.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.924
I respect what you want,
I really do.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.762
But what hurts is that
I lost a friend.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.564
Over a stupid...
like, not even a kiss!

08:16.597 --> 08:20.601
If there's anything
that I can do...

08:20.701 --> 08:22.703
for us to be friends again...

08:25.906 --> 08:28.008
I'd like that.

08:28.108 --> 08:30.043
- There he is, we got him.
- Wait, Ace...

08:30.143 --> 08:31.579
Horseshoe Bay PD.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.946
You're under arrest
for the theft of eight bodies...

08:33.046 --> 08:34.447
- What?
- What's going on here?

08:34.582 --> 08:36.083
...from the Horseshoe
Bay graveyard.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.417
Okay, Officer, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

08:37.585 --> 08:38.752
Wait, what?

08:38.852 --> 08:39.753
You have the right
to remain silent...

08:39.853 --> 08:40.721
I didn't steal any bodies.

08:40.821 --> 08:42.990
I know... I believe you.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.162
♪ ♪

09:06.113 --> 09:07.147
Joyce.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.617
How am I not allowed
in the bullpen?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.084
I'm the community liaison.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.419
Not anymore.

09:12.519 --> 09:14.421
That program's under review
by the new chief.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.656
Hey.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.390
They just booked Ace.

09:17.490 --> 09:18.626
They wouldn't let me near him.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.027
Okay, well, Carson's on his way,

09:20.127 --> 09:21.629
and Nick is trying
to reach Ace's parents.

09:21.695 --> 09:23.330
Yeah, it turns out
the Appalachian Trail

09:23.430 --> 09:24.732
has zero cell coverage.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.234
In the meantime,

09:27.334 --> 09:28.435
I just turned
in my first assignment

09:28.535 --> 09:29.970
as Abbott's law clerk,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.939
so how about I throw a
little habeas corpus around?

09:32.039 --> 09:33.006
Mm.

09:33.106 --> 09:35.208
Nancy, the chief will see you.

09:38.445 --> 09:39.647
Chief Lovett, I'm Nancy...

09:39.713 --> 09:42.082
Nancy Drew.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.450
Get over here.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.987
I am thrilled to have you
in my office, Nancy Drew.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.289
God, I wish I had something
around here for you to sign.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.357
Why?

09:50.457 --> 09:51.892
Come on, you're a local hero.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.494
You've been solving actual
crimes since you were 12.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.496
God, at 12,
I was still searching

09:56.664 --> 09:57.731
for everyone's missing pets.

09:57.831 --> 09:59.733
So, what can I do for you?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.301
You can release my friend Ace.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.470
Sorry, I can't do that.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.039
No, not with what we found
behind his parents' house,

10:06.139 --> 10:09.142
where Ace has been house-sitting
alone for weeks.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.111
We've got a very
strong case against him.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.746
You don't, because
there is no chance

10:12.846 --> 10:15.448
Ace dug up graves
and stole bodies.

10:15.548 --> 10:16.850
That's not who he is.

10:16.950 --> 10:20.187
Ace is responsible
and law-abiding.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.289
- His father was a police captain.
- Sure.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.224
Police captains have been
known to father children.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.827
Ace is also employed
by the town.

10:26.927 --> 10:28.161
At the coroner's office,

10:28.261 --> 10:29.797
where he's surrounded
by dead bodies.

10:29.897 --> 10:32.165
So is the coroner,
but you didn't arrest him.

10:32.265 --> 10:35.135
Do you actually have a shred
of evidence against Ace?

10:35.235 --> 10:36.737
Oh, we've got the goods.

10:40.107 --> 10:42.710
Box is a little small for
eight bodies, don't you think?

10:42.810 --> 10:44.712
This is great.
I love it.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.113
We're just gonna make
each other better.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.247
Take my number.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.216
Text me if you need anything.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.454
It's called habeas corpus.

10:54.554 --> 10:55.956
"To have the body."

10:56.056 --> 10:57.590
It means you literally have
to have the eight bodies

10:57.691 --> 10:59.059
before you arrest Ace.

10:59.159 --> 11:01.094
That's not
what habeas corpus means.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.296
What?

11:04.031 --> 11:06.299
Oh, my God! The ice cream
sandwiches I ordered!

11:06.399 --> 11:08.501
That's not ice cream sandwiches!
What are you...?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.839
What are you doing?
It's a delivery for the chief.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.110
Definitely not
ice cream sandwiches.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.782
They clearly ID'd it
as one of the missing bodies.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.116
Maybe because of this ring?

11:23.216 --> 11:24.284
It could be a family crest?

11:24.384 --> 11:25.385
And this piece of sleeve.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.754
Burial clothes.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.188
Right, so let's do the same.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.890
Nancy already has the names
of the eight bodies

11:29.990 --> 11:32.059
from her investigating
a few weeks ago.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.326
So let's just identify the body

11:33.426 --> 11:34.928
this arm belongs to
and figure out

11:35.028 --> 11:36.764
how it wound up
behind Ace's house.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.331
Then maybe that'll help us
figure out

11:38.431 --> 11:40.768
why someone would have
the motive to steal it.

11:40.801 --> 11:41.935
And seven more.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.503
We'll split up and move fast.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.072
- I'll grab Nick.
- Okay, all right.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.339
Bess and I will do a deep dive

11:46.439 --> 11:47.540
on the identities
of our "late eight."

11:47.640 --> 11:49.009
God, this is my fault.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.044
This deep dive should
have happened weeks ago.

11:51.144 --> 11:52.645
Instead, I let the case go cold.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.782
Hey, we are going to defrost it.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.283
Okay?

11:56.383 --> 11:57.951
We got you.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.025
No leads from any
of the other neighbors.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.393
What are you drinking?

12:06.493 --> 12:09.562
Oh, Mrs. Burnstein gave me
some apple cider.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.198
She saw my video.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.802
Anyway, she also told me
about what happened.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.804
Mr. Williams next door

12:16.870 --> 12:18.138
is the one
who discovered the arm.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.907
He was walking his dog
around 10:00 p.m.

12:20.007 --> 12:21.108
when it started barking
like crazy

12:21.208 --> 12:22.475
and then ran off in Ace's yard.

12:22.575 --> 12:23.977
And, let me guess,
brought his owner back

12:24.077 --> 12:25.145
a skeletal arm treat.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.114
- Mm-hmm.
- Let's go.

12:28.615 --> 12:31.051
Pretty big hole
for just an arm, no?

12:34.687 --> 12:37.991
My dad says Ace should be
able to post bail tomorrow.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.293
His arraignment
will be in a few days.

12:40.393 --> 12:42.029
Hopefully that gives us
enough time

12:42.129 --> 12:43.630
to prove he's innocent,
and they'll have no choice

12:43.730 --> 12:44.865
but to drop the charges.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.835
Do you hear that?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.939
It's 10:00 p.m.

12:52.039 --> 12:53.473
Exactly when Mr. Williams' dogs

12:53.573 --> 12:55.708
started barking
and ran off last night.

12:55.843 --> 12:57.410
Hey, look at all these.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.047
Dozens of complaints
from the past couple nights

13:00.147 --> 13:02.515
about dogs barking
in this neighborhood.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.451
At various spots,
including this one.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.419
What time were
the complaints made?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.555
Right after 10:00 p.m.
Every one.

13:09.957 --> 13:12.025
I'm thinking
we follow those dogs.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.098
Tell me you're not
blaming yourself

13:18.198 --> 13:19.199
for what happened to Ace.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.134
Of course I'm blaming myself.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.702
If I'd found these bodies
weeks ago

13:22.870 --> 13:24.471
instead of taking on
a bunch of small-time cases

13:24.571 --> 13:27.707
to pay the bills, Ace
wouldn't be in jail right now.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.743
You sure that's all it is?

13:30.878 --> 13:32.212
What else would it be?

13:34.114 --> 13:36.950
Listen, Ace...

13:37.050 --> 13:38.118
Ace is a mess.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.020
I've had my heart broken before,

13:40.120 --> 13:41.288
but, man, if I have to hear

13:41.388 --> 13:42.789
about how his barometer

13:42.890 --> 13:44.491
shattered one more time, then...

13:44.591 --> 13:46.159
What is that?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.197
Is that a footprint?

14:17.424 --> 14:19.626
Nobody stole that body.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.195
It rose from the grave itself.

14:34.975 --> 14:38.011
Hey, listen, thank you so much

14:38.111 --> 14:39.846
for agreeing to sit down
with the Glasses.

14:39.947 --> 14:41.381
Hear 'em out, you know?

14:41.481 --> 14:42.983
This could be a worthwhile
opportunity for you.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.653
Hmm, yeah, and for you
it gets you out of their debt?

14:46.753 --> 14:49.589
Yeah, well,
it's not a debt exactly.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.292
It's more like
a hostage situation.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.194
Right, oh, yeah, maybe next time

14:54.294 --> 14:56.496
you rent and then destroy
a skinwalker hatchet

14:56.596 --> 14:58.065
belonging to some, you know,

14:58.165 --> 14:59.466
friendly suburban relic traders,

14:59.566 --> 15:01.868
maybe don't put your
Porsche up as collateral?

15:01.969 --> 15:03.003
Hey, be fair.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.537
You know you miss
those relic runs

15:04.637 --> 15:06.073
in my car just as much as I do.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.976
And, besides, it's no secret
that the town council

15:09.076 --> 15:11.178
is gonna be voting
to reduce the quarterly funding

15:11.278 --> 15:12.980
for the Historical Society.

15:13.046 --> 15:14.481
Yeah, I am doing
everything I can

15:14.581 --> 15:17.684
to remind the town
how important the Society is,

15:17.784 --> 15:19.819
you know, without exposing
its secrets, of course.

15:19.987 --> 15:22.389
Of course. Of course.

15:22.489 --> 15:23.756
It's... you know, it doesn't hurt

15:23.856 --> 15:25.792
to sit down with
like-minded people, right?

15:25.892 --> 15:28.861
I mean, this... this... they...
they could be your backup plan.

15:28.996 --> 15:31.464
Yeah, fine, and I will
happily sit down with them

15:31.564 --> 15:33.166
after the Vigil,
thank you very much.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.501
Wait...

15:36.003 --> 15:37.470
Uh...

15:41.674 --> 15:45.078
Or right now could work, too.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.346
Here she is.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.016
Bess, meet Shelby and Jonas.

15:49.082 --> 15:50.650
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.484
Hi!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.890
As Keeper, you receive
newly-discovered

15:58.025 --> 16:00.227
relics for safe storage.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.095
What if I told you

16:02.195 --> 16:05.132
that many of those relics
and haunted objects

16:05.232 --> 16:07.800
could fetch a premium
on the black market?

16:07.900 --> 16:11.771
I would say that was true, yes.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.474
And since the items bound
for your Archive Room

16:14.574 --> 16:16.776
are technically off the books,

16:16.876 --> 16:19.946
why not let us utilize
our expertise

16:20.047 --> 16:25.452
as relic connoisseurs
by monetizing them for you?

16:25.552 --> 16:26.519
See, this-this right here,

16:26.619 --> 16:28.155
this sounds like a cool idea.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.057
Totally.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.261
I'm sorry.
I have to take this.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.063
Um, okay.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.066
I mean...

16:39.166 --> 16:40.700
Hi, 4:00 p.m. at the docks?

16:40.800 --> 16:43.703
I will get a ride
and I'll meet you there.

16:43.803 --> 16:44.837
Okay.

16:47.107 --> 16:48.975
So, what do you think?

16:49.076 --> 16:50.277
Can we help each other?

16:50.377 --> 16:53.313
Um, Mr. and Mrs. Glass,

16:53.413 --> 16:58.551
I admire your
entrepreneurial zest,

16:58.651 --> 17:02.289
but I must decline your offer.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.423
Sorry.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.996
Listen, if I could...

17:10.097 --> 17:11.531
Okay, um, listen.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.732
Hold on, please.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.301
Please, please, please, listen,

17:14.401 --> 17:17.170
I'm... I'm so sorry that that
didn't work, obviously.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.173
But you saw I tried my best.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.008
All right.

17:22.109 --> 17:23.743
Deal's a deal.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.278
You can have your car back.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.613
Really?

17:27.614 --> 17:30.117
Thank you.
Thanks.

17:36.823 --> 17:39.959
Aren't those your paying cases?

17:40.127 --> 17:42.229
These are cases that can wait.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.335
Good news, Ace definitely
didn't steal any bodies.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.871
- Bad news...
- It's looking like the bodies stole themselves.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.241
Nick and I only witnessed
one walking corpse,

17:54.341 --> 17:57.043
but I have to imagine the other
seven are out there as well.

17:57.144 --> 18:00.147
As to why and how

18:00.247 --> 18:02.014
eight corpses reanimated,

18:02.149 --> 18:04.851
burst from their graves, and
have been creeping around town

18:04.951 --> 18:06.553
for the last five weeks...

18:06.653 --> 18:09.822
Could be a ritual gone awry,

18:09.922 --> 18:11.591
could be a mystical timer
that went off.

18:11.691 --> 18:13.760
Totally, it could be either.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.628
But reanimated bodies

18:15.728 --> 18:17.397
are found in plenty
of cultures worldwide.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.898
You have the <i>upyr</i> of Ukraine,

18:18.998 --> 18:20.367
you have the <i>soucriant</i>
of the Caribbean...

18:20.467 --> 18:22.169
Is there a common method
for how to deal with them?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.836
Aside from run away
very quickly?

18:23.936 --> 18:26.473
Depends on how they died.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.907
Once we know that,

18:28.007 --> 18:29.309
we can figure out what
caused them to reanimate.

18:29.409 --> 18:31.644
And then from there,
get them back to rest.

18:31.744 --> 18:33.446
That is tomorrow's mission.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.447
Today's mission?

18:34.547 --> 18:35.782
Find the bodies.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.350
Get some proof to Chief Lovett

18:37.450 --> 18:39.252
about their current behavior.

18:39.352 --> 18:41.621
And how exactly are
we going to achieve that?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.256
I am working on it.
I have a theory

18:43.356 --> 18:46.859
based on what I saw in the marsh
and hole in Ace's backyard.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.796
I think the bodies bury
themselves during the daytime,

18:49.896 --> 18:51.398
and at night they rise.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.932
I just have to figure
out what they're doing.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.301
Okay, while you puzzle that out,

18:54.401 --> 18:55.668
I did get an ID on the body

18:55.768 --> 18:57.204
that is now one-armed.

18:57.270 --> 18:59.939
The ring belonged to
a woman named India Burnett.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.374
India.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.842
I remember that name.

19:02.942 --> 19:05.678
Most recently deceased
of all the dead bodies.

19:05.778 --> 19:09.849
She died in 1998
at the age of 27.

19:09.949 --> 19:11.984
"Cause of death inconclusive."

19:12.084 --> 19:12.985
Profoundly unhelpful.

19:13.085 --> 19:15.388
But I did find this.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.924
Took a lot of stalking around
the hilltopper part of town,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.226
but I got the story.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.960
India's parents
were really wealthy,

19:21.060 --> 19:22.395
but she was deeply troubled.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.996
She suffered from long,
depressive episodes,

19:24.096 --> 19:25.465
so she took to living
alone on her yacht.

19:25.565 --> 19:27.934
That's where they found
her body in 1998.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.369
There's the name
of the boat behind her.

19:29.469 --> 19:31.103
<i>Lost Time.</i>

19:31.238 --> 19:35.608
I recognized that boat
from my Marvin days.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.311
Yeah, it's docked in
the private hilltoppers' harbor.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.812
They say that no one's
been inside it

19:39.912 --> 19:41.080

19:41.248 --> 19:42.382
Well, it's about to get
a visitor.

19:42.482 --> 19:44.116
Okay, I got to get back
to The Claw.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.118
Carson probably needs
help with Ace's case.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.855
Uh, have you spoken to Ace?

19:48.955 --> 19:51.023
How's he doing?

19:51.123 --> 19:52.592
Ace was suspended
from his job at the morgue

19:52.692 --> 19:53.926
until this is over.

19:56.263 --> 19:59.031
I'm gonna find the proof
we need to free him.

I'm searching your boat.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.210

I'll have your boat impounded

Be sure to tell the Gloversons
why their daily catch

21:58.818 --> 22:00.987

I hope that doesn't mean
I risked your boat

22:26.746 --> 22:28.448
or your livelihood.

23:05.017 --> 23:08.054
Do I sense a hint of regret?

23:08.154 --> 23:10.590
No, it's just Nick and I
have barely even broken up.

23:10.690 --> 23:12.825
We haven't even
had time to talk about

23:12.925 --> 23:14.561
things we haven't even
talked about.

23:14.661 --> 23:15.862
What am I going to say to him

23:15.962 --> 23:17.830
at the Lovers' Vigil tonight?

23:17.930 --> 23:19.599
Got some stuff here.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.803
Are you sketching an old
outline of Horseshoe Bay?

23:23.903 --> 23:26.573
'Cause that's not bad.

23:26.673 --> 23:27.774
Sorry, what?

23:27.874 --> 23:30.810
Well, here, check it out.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.779
This is old
Horseshoe Bay before '99,

23:32.879 --> 23:34.481
when they incorporated
the eastern marsh.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.015
It looks just like it.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.350
I only remember because
I used to take Lucy out there

23:38.485 --> 23:39.886
to stare at the stars.

23:39.986 --> 23:42.188
That's close to where I found
India's body last night.

23:42.288 --> 23:43.623
Okay, hold up.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.391
What does an old map of
Horseshoe Bay have to do

23:45.492 --> 23:47.494
with whatever India's
reanimated body is up to now?

23:47.527 --> 23:48.961
I love how casually
you just said that.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.397
What if India's body
is following a pattern,

23:51.498 --> 23:53.132
and the other bodies, too?

23:53.232 --> 23:55.001
Bess, can you track all

23:55.101 --> 23:57.570
the Stoop Snoop complaints
about barking dogs

23:57.670 --> 23:59.506
since the night
the bodies went missing?

23:59.572 --> 24:01.073
- Mm-hmm.
- Every neighborhood in Horseshoe Bay.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.241
Look for patterns.

24:02.341 --> 24:03.543
Yeah, on it.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.513
If the dogs bark
when the bodies emerge,

24:06.579 --> 24:07.780
maybe we can locate the others

24:07.880 --> 24:09.516
and predict where
they're going tonight.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.317
And we can be there
when they move again.

24:11.417 --> 24:12.952
I will send you what
I find from the road.

24:13.052 --> 24:15.221

24:15.321 --> 24:17.389

24:17.524 --> 24:18.625
And we'll make it speedy

24:18.725 --> 24:20.893

the old wheels back.

24:28.100 --> 24:31.337

solve your issue

24:32.739 --> 24:35.608
with the town council, but...

24:35.708 --> 24:38.778
You know, if I can help at all,
I'm here.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.180
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.782
Yeah, I'm just trying to figure
out another way...

24:42.882 --> 24:44.283
Ryan, what's happening?

24:44.383 --> 24:45.818
I don't know,
the brakes are going out!

24:54.594 --> 24:57.697
Hi, hi, hello,
this is Bess Marvin.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.399
I'm gonna be late
to pick up a shipment.

25:00.567 --> 25:02.802
Is that a talisman?

25:02.902 --> 25:05.838
I'm sorry, my "assistants"
picked it up just now?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.708
No, I don't have any assistants.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.011
I can't believe it.

25:12.111 --> 25:13.279
The Glasses did this.

25:13.379 --> 25:15.247
Oh, my God.

25:16.348 --> 25:19.185
Okay. You know what?
When we get back into town,

25:19.285 --> 25:20.787
I am getting my shipment back

25:20.887 --> 25:22.689
and they're having
a piece of my mind.

25:22.789 --> 25:24.256
- No, no, stay out of this, okay?
- Yes.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.093
Because I-I underestimated
how dangerous they are.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.228
I mean, we could have died.

Mmm.

- Yes!
- I wasn't gonna let you

26:44.303 --> 26:45.471
Do you mind?

27:09.228 --> 27:11.063
I just spent ten hours
writing this legal memo

27:11.163 --> 27:13.299

he says none of it's usable.

Yeah, I saw it in the pawnshop
window last month.

27:56.976 --> 27:59.645
I needed the money
to pay a contractor

27:59.746 --> 28:00.913

28:29.175 --> 28:31.210
Neither of us
have changed our minds.

We can't live our lives

It's not really living.

28:43.790 --> 28:45.524
I mean, you...

28:46.325 --> 28:48.928
You should download
one of those apps

28:49.028 --> 28:49.996
and say yes.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.331
Say yes to what?

28:53.365 --> 28:55.667
All the women
who are going to message you.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.941
I will take that

29:03.442 --> 29:05.144

29:16.856 --> 29:18.024
I just don't know which ones.

29:18.124 --> 29:20.259
Is this arts and crafts?

29:20.359 --> 29:23.896
No, it is the centerpiece
of the Lover's Vigil.

29:23.996 --> 29:26.232
Didn't mean to offend.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.366
Tell me.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.403
Local legend says
on this night every year,

29:31.503 --> 29:35.341
lovers' souls separated in death
can find each other.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.979
So people write
the name of their beloved,

29:40.079 --> 29:43.249
seal it in a bottle,
and send it out to sea

29:43.349 --> 29:46.218
so their souls can reunite
if they so desire.

29:46.318 --> 29:47.987
On this side or the other.

29:49.021 --> 29:50.589
And there's general
buy-in on this?

29:50.689 --> 29:51.858
You seem to have an issue

29:51.958 --> 29:53.692
with what people
in this town believe.

29:56.062 --> 29:57.229
In my experience,

29:57.329 --> 29:59.265
when people start
believing ghost stories,

29:59.365 --> 30:00.666
problems lie ahead.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.735
I don't want
to see anyone get hurt.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.271
Same.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.174
I'm running out of bottles.

30:08.274 --> 30:10.642

for a minute?

30:10.742 --> 30:12.311

weeks ago in my loft and...

31:47.739 --> 31:48.874
You didn't.

31:52.078 --> 31:54.413
I did.
It's my fault.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.685

have just cracked
