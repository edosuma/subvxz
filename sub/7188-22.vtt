20:09.408 --> 20:10.909
MMM.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.178
AHH.

20:13.478 --> 20:16.014
MMM-MMM.

20:17.716 --> 20:18.317
HEY, BLACK KNIGHT!

20:18.317 --> 20:19.351
YOUR BOOT'S
UNBUCKLED.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.320
WHAT? WHICH ONE?

20:21.320 --> 20:24.256
YAAAH!

20:25.390 --> 20:28.193
MMM, MMM, MMM. AAH!

20:28.193 --> 20:30.362
UH! UH!

20:30.362 --> 20:32.030
WAKE UP, YO!

20:32.030 --> 20:34.766
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU
THAT YOU CAN'T SHOW

20:34.766 --> 20:36.735
JUST A LITTLE BIT
OF WILLPOWER?

20:36.735 --> 20:38.270
DUH! THEY'RE BOYS.

20:38.270 --> 20:39.938
OH, RIGHT.

20:39.938 --> 20:41.273
UH!

20:41.273 --> 20:43.408
AAH!

20:43.408 --> 20:45.444
FIND HER!

20:45.444 --> 20:48.347
AAH! IS THERE ANYTHING
MORE INCONVENIENT

20:48.347 --> 20:52.451
THAN BEING A ZIRADE
WITH SWIMMER'S EAR?

20:53.852 --> 20:54.853
COOL AERODYNAMICS!

20:54.853 --> 20:58.323
EEK! A FIRE-EATING
DRAGON!

21:02.494 --> 21:03.595
THERE! GET HER!

21:03.595 --> 21:05.530
CHECK OUT THE SUIT
TRIXIE GAVE ME.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.366
WHAT? YOU THINK THAT
LAME DRAGON COSTUME

21:07.366 --> 21:09.234
IS BETTER THAN
THE BRADSTER'S?

21:09.234 --> 21:14.106
MY WHOLE KNIGHT IN
SHINING ARMOR THING
I GOT GOING ON,

21:14.106 --> 21:16.308
THEY'LL BE HITTING
ON ME LIKE CRAZY.

21:16.308 --> 21:18.277
SPEAKING OF TAKING A HIT.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.445
AAH-OOH!

21:22.381 --> 21:24.082
THANKS
FOR THE SAVE, TRIX.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.318
IT'S COOL.
I OWED YOU ONE ANYWAY--

21:26.318 --> 21:29.121
AFTER MESSING THINGS UP
FOR YOU AND DANIKA.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.956
[DANIKA SOBBING]

21:31.890 --> 21:35.227
I GUESS YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
JUDGE ON APPEARANCE,

21:35.227 --> 21:36.862
ALTHOUGH YOU KIND OF DID,

21:36.862 --> 21:38.930
AND YOU WERE KIND OF RIGHT.

21:38.930 --> 21:39.831
WAIT! I'M CONFUSED!

21:39.831 --> 21:41.233
WHAT'S THE LESSON HERE?!

21:41.233 --> 21:43.468
MAYBE IF I HADN'T
BEEN SO SHALLOW,

21:43.468 --> 21:47.839
THEN SHE WOULDN'T
HAVE HAD A REASON TO GO
ALL JEALOUS ON ME,

21:47.839 --> 21:51.376
ALTHOUGH THEN
I'D BE GOING OUT
WITH A DEADLY SIREN.

21:51.376 --> 21:53.812
HOLD UP. THAT DOESN'T
SOUND RIGHT EITHER.

21:53.812 --> 21:55.147
WHAT IS THE LESSON HERE?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.082
NEVER SWIM RIGHT
AFTER A MEAL?

21:57.082 --> 22:00.585
ME? I'D HAVE TO GO WITH
NEVER TAKE ROMANTIC ADVICE

22:00.585 --> 22:03.488
FROM A LITTLE GIRL'S
FOLDED PAPER TOY.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.123
GUESS SO.
SOUNDS GOOD.

22:05.123 --> 22:05.390
THAT IS SO TRUE.

22:08.427 --> 22:13.131
NOW, THE DRAGON'S
AWKWARD FLAME-OUT.

22:13.131 --> 22:15.300
Danika:
JAKE, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

22:15.300 --> 22:19.538
NO, NO, LISTEN.
DANIKA, I WROTE YOU
A SONG TO APOLOGIZE.

22:19.538 --> 22:21.873
♪ SORRY,
IT'S WHAT I AM ♪

22:21.873 --> 22:25.077
♪ AND WHAT I AM
IS A BAD MAN ♪

22:25.077 --> 22:26.611
♪ I HURT YOU BAD,
IT MADE YOU SAD... ♪

22:26.611 --> 22:28.914
HEY, FOOL,
WHAT'S GOING--YO!
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

22:28.914 --> 22:31.983
IT'S IN THE INTEREST
OF PUBLIC SCIENCE!
