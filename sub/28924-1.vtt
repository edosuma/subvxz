07:48.841 --> 07:51.862
Could be 238 or gamma radiation.

07:51.864 --> 07:55.020
Either way, her brain is fried.

07:55.022 --> 07:57.119
Penn won't take her.

07:57.121 --> 07:59.260
Maybe he can use her
for the harvest, though.

07:59.262 --> 08:02.762
You gonna be the one to escort her back?

08:05.957 --> 08:06.983
Let's just do this.

08:06.985 --> 08:10.068
I wanna get home before it gets dark.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.820
That there is poison!

09:02.269 --> 09:03.602
My name's Peeky.

09:04.487 --> 09:07.987
Peeky Joe, on account of I see everything.

09:10.487 --> 09:13.045
What the hell are you doing drinking that?

09:13.047 --> 09:14.214
I'm thirsty.

09:17.165 --> 09:17.998
Here.

09:19.582 --> 09:20.499
It's clean.

09:26.429 --> 09:29.863
What are you, what are you
doing just walking around here?

09:29.865 --> 09:32.615
You're not contaminated, are you?

09:42.285 --> 09:43.703
Where are you from, anyway?

09:43.705 --> 09:47.205
'Cause I know everyone around these parts,

09:49.149 --> 09:52.482
what's left of it, but I don't know you.

09:53.842 --> 09:54.759
I just...

09:57.426 --> 10:00.259
I used to live a few streets down.

10:03.709 --> 10:04.876
What happened?

10:06.361 --> 10:07.361
Excuse me?

10:08.759 --> 10:11.075
Was there a fire?

10:11.077 --> 10:11.910
A fire?

10:13.161 --> 10:15.601
How long you been hiding?

10:15.603 --> 10:16.853
I don't know.

10:18.004 --> 10:19.100
Months?

10:19.102 --> 10:20.540
I lost track of time.

10:20.542 --> 10:23.376
You been holding out underground?

10:23.378 --> 10:25.211
No, not holding out.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.156
They murdered her.

10:30.158 --> 10:31.658
What's that now?

10:32.793 --> 10:34.376
Those guys, they,

10:35.401 --> 10:39.298
they murdered her right on the street.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.876
Yeah, unfortunately that's common.

10:42.878 --> 10:44.498
You see, they've been
killing off everybody

10:44.500 --> 10:47.458
that is affected by the blast.

10:47.460 --> 10:49.986
If you're healthy, like you and me,

10:49.988 --> 10:52.759
they take you in as slaves.

10:52.761 --> 10:54.844
She must have been crazy.

10:57.481 --> 10:59.116
You smell like shit.

10:59.118 --> 11:02.118
When was the last time you showered?

11:04.660 --> 11:08.160
Well come on, I know a place, fresh water.

11:22.222 --> 11:24.961
Hey, I thought you were
gonna give me privacy.

11:24.963 --> 11:26.435
I'm sorry.

11:26.437 --> 11:27.623
I am sorry.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.292
Old habits die hard.

11:30.585 --> 11:34.335
They call me Peeky for
a reason, sweet thing.

11:35.561 --> 11:38.700
You're welcome for the
bar of soap, by the way.

11:38.702 --> 11:40.835
I only got one bar left.

11:40.837 --> 11:42.115
Hey.

11:59.271 --> 12:03.273
You really don't know nothing, do ya?

12:03.275 --> 12:06.916
Well they started hacking
the conglomerates.

12:06.918 --> 12:08.713
Soon after that, they started

12:08.715 --> 12:11.798
breaking into the rich neighborhoods.

12:12.791 --> 12:16.791
They wouldn't stop until
there was nothing left.

12:17.675 --> 12:20.513
They got too big in numbers.

12:20.515 --> 12:21.913
Who?

12:21.915 --> 12:24.772
They call themselves the Disciples.

12:24.774 --> 12:28.932
You've probably seen
'em walking around here.

12:28.934 --> 12:32.953
They got our town, and
the next towns over.

12:32.955 --> 12:36.318
And who knows what else by now?

12:36.320 --> 12:37.792
Not enough power or signal strength

12:37.794 --> 12:40.794
to get the news around here anymore.

12:42.502 --> 12:43.860
Hell, I wouldn't be surprised

12:43.862 --> 12:47.112
if it spread across the country by now.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.796
What was wrong with the water?

12:51.798 --> 12:56.500
Contamination and radiation
been running rampant.

12:56.502 --> 13:00.137
Our power plant went down a few weeks ago,

13:00.139 --> 13:02.156
went down in flames.

13:02.158 --> 13:03.919
Most of the survivors
have been running around

13:03.921 --> 13:07.417
with a lot of problems with themselves.

13:07.419 --> 13:10.836
Just like the poor woman you saw earlier.

13:12.038 --> 13:16.079
Hell, I wouldn't even
call 'em human anymore.

13:16.081 --> 13:19.801
I've seen some cases
where skin's falling off,

13:19.803 --> 13:20.886
and mutatin'.

13:22.699 --> 13:24.580
It ain't a pretty sight.

13:24.582 --> 13:25.940
Why would they do this?

13:25.942 --> 13:29.014
Because they're just a bunch
of poor, angry assholes

13:29.016 --> 13:31.266
trying to fight the system.

13:32.422 --> 13:36.719
If you ask me, this country
needed a revolution,

13:36.721 --> 13:39.304
but this ain't no way to do it.

13:41.542 --> 13:42.656
You really don't know what the hell's

13:42.658 --> 13:44.991
going on around here, do ya?

13:47.382 --> 13:48.457
What the hell happened to you

13:48.459 --> 13:50.959
you got locked up for so long?

13:54.111 --> 13:55.944
It's okay, sweetheart.

13:56.830 --> 13:58.163
You can tell me.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.288
I left them.

14:01.290 --> 14:03.083
You left who?

14:03.085 --> 14:06.488
My husband and my two daughters.

14:06.490 --> 14:08.283
What do you mean you left 'em?

14:08.285 --> 14:10.627
Just up and ran off?

14:10.629 --> 14:11.462
No.

14:13.430 --> 14:15.513
But I might as well have.

14:18.031 --> 14:22.285
I was making dinner, waiting
for Charles to get home.

14:22.287 --> 14:24.088
Isabelle was in the front room studying,

14:24.090 --> 14:26.862
and Desiree was out shopping.

14:26.864 --> 14:27.987
Hey Isabelle?

14:27.989 --> 14:30.189
I need to go to the basement
for a few ingredients.

14:30.191 --> 14:31.187
Can you let your dad in?

14:31.189 --> 14:32.328
I saw him just pull up.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.830
Yeah no problem.

14:49.736 --> 14:51.569
What the?

14:52.536 --> 14:55.119
Stay down, Rockefeller!

14:57.896 --> 15:00.396
Anyone else in the house?
No.

15:01.449 --> 15:04.436
There's money and jewelry
upstairs in the master bedroom.

15:04.438 --> 15:06.161
Just take it and leave.

15:06.163 --> 15:08.220
I won't call the police.

15:08.222 --> 15:10.337
You think I want your money?

15:10.339 --> 15:12.241
What do you want then?

15:12.243 --> 15:14.538
What do I want?

15:14.540 --> 15:15.373
Well.

15:23.667 --> 15:26.566
If I didn't hesitate, who knows?

15:26.568 --> 15:29.068
Maybe I could have saved them.

15:30.227 --> 15:31.060
Maybe not.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.284
But at least I would've tried.

15:36.286 --> 15:39.185
Yeah sounds like the Disciples.

15:39.187 --> 15:42.422
Your house must have been
one of the early firsts.

15:42.424 --> 15:45.358
That's what they started doing

15:45.360 --> 15:47.404
is either killing who was in them mansions

15:47.406 --> 15:49.739
or turning them into slaves.

15:51.481 --> 15:52.478
But who knows?

15:52.480 --> 15:55.004
Maybe they were able to get away.

15:55.006 --> 15:57.377
Or maybe they were killed.

15:57.379 --> 16:01.046
Possibly, but we don't know that for sure.

16:04.983 --> 16:06.150
Tell you what.

16:07.880 --> 16:10.195
Why don't you ride with me?

16:10.197 --> 16:12.755
You have a vehicle?

16:12.757 --> 16:14.137
No I didn't mean that.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.980
I meant why don't you
trek with me on foot?

16:17.982 --> 16:21.315
You need protection, and I need company.

16:22.302 --> 16:23.542
I'll pass.

16:23.544 --> 16:27.874
Listen, I know a few places
the Disciples congregate.

16:27.876 --> 16:30.598
And if your family's still alive,

16:30.600 --> 16:32.161
it's more than likely they're gonna be

16:32.163 --> 16:34.621
at one of these compounds,

16:34.623 --> 16:37.706
slaving away against their free will.

16:39.283 --> 16:43.366
If this is the case, I
can help you get 'em back.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.337
I assume

16:47.864 --> 16:50.518
that you ain't got one of these.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.981
And that's too bad, because
you're gonna need it

16:52.983 --> 16:55.150
if you're gonna be a hero.

16:56.904 --> 16:57.737
Now.

16:59.898 --> 17:03.065
Now I got a shit load of these things.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.955
I've been collecting them
through the wreckage,

17:06.958 --> 17:07.958
bullets too.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.958
But I only got two hands.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.497
Now I can teach you how to use 'em.

17:16.499 --> 17:18.460
It ain't hard.

17:18.462 --> 17:20.080
Now I hate these son of a bitches

17:20.083 --> 17:22.000
just as much as you do,

17:23.042 --> 17:25.361
so let's work together, sweetie.

17:25.363 --> 17:27.157
My name is Sloan.

17:27.160 --> 17:28.733
Excuse me.

17:28.735 --> 17:31.638
Let's kill these motherfuckin' assholes,

17:31.640 --> 17:35.057
and get your family back together, Sloan.

17:41.098 --> 17:43.765
Everything's gonna be just fine.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.765
Now the first place I know about

17:55.767 --> 17:58.017
is a few miles up the road.

17:59.447 --> 18:02.118
Now we're gonna need to take 'em all out

18:02.120 --> 18:05.537
if we're gonna set up camp for the night.

18:07.043 --> 18:08.626
You okay with that?

18:12.462 --> 18:13.293
Yeah.

18:13.295 --> 18:14.128
Okay.

18:16.419 --> 18:18.935
You don't seem too confident.

18:18.937 --> 18:21.520
How's your aim with that thing?

18:25.846 --> 18:29.679
All right, I reckon I
can spare a few minutes.

18:30.727 --> 18:33.309
Now you're gonna squeeze
it with your finger.

18:33.311 --> 18:35.729
You're not gonna pull the trigger,

18:35.731 --> 18:37.928
just use the tip.

18:37.930 --> 18:40.306
Otherwise you're gonna shift to the left.

18:40.308 --> 18:42.106
You ever shot one of these before?

18:42.108 --> 18:43.570
I mean, my dad had one when I was little,

18:43.572 --> 18:45.330
but I wasn't allowed to touch it.

18:45.332 --> 18:47.106
All right then, this is gonna

18:47.108 --> 18:50.589
scare the shit out of you the first time.

18:50.591 --> 18:54.008
Whatever you do, don't drop it all right?

18:55.530 --> 18:56.363
Here.

18:58.351 --> 19:02.028
Now you're gonna line up your sights,

19:02.030 --> 19:03.613
take a deep breath,

19:05.348 --> 19:06.348
now squeeze.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.959
By golly, you're a natural!

19:13.108 --> 19:14.850
But it ain't gonna be that easy

19:14.852 --> 19:18.669
when you have flesh and
blood in your eyeline.

19:18.671 --> 19:21.143
Now you just remember your family

19:21.145 --> 19:25.606
when doubt comes knocking
on your door, you hear?

19:25.608 --> 19:28.027
Now let's practice on your reloads.

19:33.918 --> 19:37.414
You actually think my husband
and kids are in this place?

19:37.416 --> 19:39.416
There's a good chance.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.032
See, the Disciples have
all these shantytowns

19:44.034 --> 19:47.940
set up all over, where
they manufacture goods,

19:47.942 --> 19:49.692
or food, or whatever.

19:50.865 --> 19:52.783
If your family isn't at this one,

19:52.785 --> 19:55.679
it's a good chance they'll be at the next.

19:55.681 --> 19:58.920
How many compounds exist like that?

19:58.922 --> 20:02.079
Well I've seen at least
four with my own eyes.

20:02.081 --> 20:03.658
If you go further north,
that's when you hit

20:03.660 --> 20:05.160
the main fortress.

20:06.113 --> 20:08.719
And that's where Red Penn lives.

20:08.721 --> 20:10.319
Who's Red Penn?

20:10.321 --> 20:12.922
Red Penn is the son of a bitch

20:12.924 --> 20:16.020
responsible for this hellhole.

20:16.022 --> 20:18.959
You can think of him as Charles Manson,

20:18.961 --> 20:21.128
or Jim Jones, or whatever.

20:22.284 --> 20:23.562
All these other pieces of shit

20:23.564 --> 20:26.314
are just swallowing the Kool-Aid.

20:27.505 --> 20:30.543
They call him Red Penn on account of

20:30.545 --> 20:33.212
he corrects the ills of society,

20:34.124 --> 20:37.020
like some teacher grading some dumb kid's

20:37.022 --> 20:39.105
mistakes on his homework.

20:40.402 --> 20:43.069
It's all childish if you ask me.

20:45.023 --> 20:46.863
We should be getting close now.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.711
We're lucky.

21:03.713 --> 21:05.850
Not many guards on today.

21:05.852 --> 21:08.019
Are you locked and loaded?

21:11.590 --> 21:12.421
Good.

21:12.423 --> 21:13.747
Peeky!

21:13.749 --> 21:15.429
Peeky that's my husband Charles!

21:15.431 --> 21:17.610
Goddamn it, keep your voice down!

21:17.612 --> 21:21.107
But he's right there, we can rescue him.

21:21.109 --> 21:25.692
We can't just run in there
guns blazing with no plan!

21:30.012 --> 21:32.170
But what are they gonna do with him?

21:32.172 --> 21:35.755
Looks like just simple slave labor to me.

21:36.612 --> 21:38.671
Be thankful he's still alive.

22:01.892 --> 22:04.975
Stay here, don't move.

22:10.991 --> 22:13.165
Where'd you find this one, Peeky?

22:13.167 --> 22:14.509
Oh she's just trying to get home

22:14.511 --> 22:17.261
like everyone else in this world.

22:18.489 --> 22:20.406
Is she a nightingale?

22:21.245 --> 22:22.922
She sure looks it.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.305
What's a nightingale?

22:24.307 --> 22:27.149
Nightingale's just a term for rich folk,

22:27.151 --> 22:28.706
mostly the womens.

22:28.708 --> 22:33.207
Pure evil in the eyes of
the peasant revolutionaries.

22:33.209 --> 22:38.143
Vengeance must be wrought,
ain't that right Chopsticks?

22:38.145 --> 22:39.478
You stay here.

22:41.375 --> 22:43.042
It's okay.

22:59.591 --> 23:01.817
Why'd you bring her here, Peeky?

23:01.819 --> 23:05.513
I got no alliance to you or Penn anymore.

23:05.515 --> 23:07.734
We were just trying to get by.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.795
You know damn well

23:09.797 --> 23:11.859
that Penn will cut your fucking head off

23:11.861 --> 23:14.194
if he finds out you're here.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.191
Probably kill me too for
not killing you myself.

23:18.193 --> 23:22.179
I ain't scared of Penn or
any of you shitless bastards.

23:22.181 --> 23:24.598
That there woman is my guest,

23:25.621 --> 23:28.638
and we just came here
to get her husband back.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.557
What, the soft-brain?

23:31.575 --> 23:34.537
That Frankenstein monster
is about as useless

23:34.539 --> 23:36.039
as tits on a boar.

23:37.141 --> 23:39.635
If it weren't for his pure
brawn to swing a hammer,

23:39.637 --> 23:41.551
probably put the poor son of a bitch

23:41.553 --> 23:44.078
out of his misery two weeks ago.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.758
What kind of radiation you think

23:45.760 --> 23:48.238
is up in that head of his?

23:48.240 --> 23:50.407
Oh, it's the worst kind.

23:51.637 --> 23:54.637
And it's about to get real bad soon.

23:55.861 --> 23:59.057
Well, I'd still like to bring him back.

23:59.059 --> 24:02.297
It'll make that lady awful happy.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.915
I'd give you some bullets to trade.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.673
This ain't negotiable, Peeky.

24:07.675 --> 24:08.842
You know that.

24:10.117 --> 24:14.659
Well, I appreciate you
bringing in the skirt.

24:14.661 --> 24:17.815
She may have even saved your life today.

24:17.817 --> 24:20.650
You know what, you leave her here?

24:21.518 --> 24:25.101
And I'll let you go
without notifying Penn.

24:26.260 --> 24:29.175
I don't think I can do that.

24:29.177 --> 24:32.354
Your loyalties lie here with us.

24:32.356 --> 24:33.189
Used to.

24:35.358 --> 24:39.474
Then I got no choice, but to put you down

24:39.476 --> 24:42.726
and take the bitch to the man upstairs.

24:43.593 --> 24:44.615
Turn around.

24:50.756 --> 24:51.589
Ah, ah!

25:11.467 --> 25:13.676
Son of a bitch!

25:51.977 --> 25:53.517
Charles!

25:53.519 --> 25:54.436
Come to me!

25:55.801 --> 25:56.855
I'm here!

25:56.857 --> 25:58.317
Sloan, where are you?

27:34.595 --> 27:36.928
Charles, Charles, Charles!

27:40.179 --> 27:41.262
Are you okay?

27:44.857 --> 27:47.036
Do you remember me?

27:47.038 --> 27:49.288
Of course I remember you.

27:52.681 --> 27:54.497
What have they done to you?

27:54.499 --> 27:56.195
What is wrong with him?

27:56.197 --> 27:59.030
Come on, we have to keep moving.

28:06.057 --> 28:07.307
It's radiation.

28:08.422 --> 28:09.679
I don't know which kind exactly,

28:09.681 --> 28:12.431
but I have seen this type before.

28:13.718 --> 28:18.298
The brain gets mushy,
and starts deteriorating.

28:18.300 --> 28:20.639
You start losing recent memories,

28:20.641 --> 28:23.517
and reverts back to a child-like state.

28:23.519 --> 28:24.719
Is he gonna get better?

28:24.721 --> 28:26.099
I mean, can it be reversed?

28:26.101 --> 28:27.460
I'm afraid not.

28:27.462 --> 28:29.759
It's only gonna get worse.

28:29.761 --> 28:33.072
I'm surprised he still
remembers your face.

28:33.074 --> 28:35.574
That may not last much longer.

28:46.996 --> 28:49.471
That's Orion, and the other one over there

28:49.473 --> 28:51.391
is the asteroid belt.

28:51.393 --> 28:52.976
Charles, Charles?

28:55.097 --> 28:56.597
Isabelle, Desiree.

28:57.838 --> 29:00.834
Can you tell me what happened that day?

29:00.836 --> 29:04.336
Oh I don't know, they just took me away.

29:05.556 --> 29:07.998
Desiree and Isabelle just ran off.

29:08.000 --> 29:12.156
I think they got away.
You think or you know?

29:12.158 --> 29:14.594
They just ran off.

29:14.596 --> 29:16.956
That was the last time I saw them.

29:16.958 --> 29:19.432
Well can you describe the people,

29:19.434 --> 29:21.934
or can you remember any names?

29:25.060 --> 29:28.227
They called each other Red and Lyle.

29:29.257 --> 29:30.090
Red?

29:31.860 --> 29:32.693
Yes sir.

29:34.580 --> 29:38.215
I'm tired, I'm gonna get some sleep.

29:50.244 --> 29:54.639
I think it was Red Penn
that broke into our house.

29:54.641 --> 29:56.263
Wouldn't surprise me.

29:56.265 --> 29:59.842
He's been pretty active in
all this from the get go.

29:59.844 --> 30:02.844
Any luck in the leads on your girls?

30:04.084 --> 30:06.667
He doesn't remember anything.

30:07.881 --> 30:09.881
He thinks they got away.

30:16.344 --> 30:18.261
Hey what are you doing?

30:19.503 --> 30:21.901
Well I haven't seen a woman in months.

30:21.903 --> 30:25.741
Just thought you might
like some attention is all.

30:25.743 --> 30:27.076
I'm all right.

30:28.142 --> 30:30.162
Come on, now.

30:30.164 --> 30:31.959
I saved your life.

30:31.961 --> 30:35.239
I'm even helping you find your family.

30:35.241 --> 30:38.861
I turned against my
brothers in the process,

30:38.863 --> 30:41.282
and they're after me now too.

30:41.284 --> 30:43.042
My husband is right there.

30:43.044 --> 30:44.599
He can see us.

30:44.601 --> 30:48.119
Oh he don't know what the hell's going on.

30:48.121 --> 30:52.356
Probably won't never get
them urges no more neither.

30:52.358 --> 30:56.221
Slim pickings out there in
that wasteland, princess.

30:56.223 --> 30:59.101
So come on, what do you say?

30:59.103 --> 31:00.603
Some other time.

31:03.953 --> 31:05.815
You'll come around.

31:05.817 --> 31:10.234
I'll be appreciated one of
these days, mark my words.

31:14.537 --> 31:16.455
Mom, how much longer do
we have to wait here?

31:16.457 --> 31:17.549
I'm supposed to be back in the courthouse

31:17.551 --> 31:19.357
in 20 minutes to meet a new client.

31:19.359 --> 31:21.858
Desiree, your sister
will be here any minute,

31:21.860 --> 31:25.186
and she has something
important to tell us.

31:25.188 --> 31:26.258
Besides, it's not gonna kill you

31:26.260 --> 31:28.258
to clock in five minutes late.

31:28.260 --> 31:30.354
Time is money, all I'm saying.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.757
Desiree?

31:31.759 --> 31:33.378
Be nice.

31:34.659 --> 31:35.492
Let's go!

31:39.975 --> 31:41.517
Isabelle!

31:41.519 --> 31:42.852
Mom, Dad, sis.

31:47.796 --> 31:50.594
I said yes.

31:50.596 --> 31:53.096
Congratulations!
Oh thanks.

31:54.995 --> 31:58.245
David, welcome to the family.

32:00.649 --> 32:02.149
It's about time.

32:05.678 --> 32:09.116
I love you.
I love you too, Mom.

32:21.024 --> 32:22.908
How much are we looking at, Izzy?

32:22.910 --> 32:23.993
10 dollars.

32:25.310 --> 32:26.988
You holding out on us?

32:26.990 --> 32:29.046
I swear to god.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.929
That's all we got.

32:30.931 --> 32:31.985
The rest of our provisions were taken

32:31.987 --> 32:35.868
up the road two weeks ago, by Disciples.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.286
Just kind of find it hard to believe

32:37.288 --> 32:40.769
that a man wearing a watch only
has 10 dollars to his name.

32:40.771 --> 32:43.104
Here, take it, it's yours.

32:45.827 --> 32:48.268
Who the hell cares what
time it is out here?

32:48.270 --> 32:51.249
I don't understand what you want from us.

32:51.251 --> 32:53.418
You have all of our money.

32:54.648 --> 32:56.369
Well shit.

32:56.371 --> 32:57.985
I can think of a few things.

32:57.987 --> 33:00.885
I beg of you, I'll do anything.

33:00.887 --> 33:02.268
And my wife?

33:02.270 --> 33:04.006
She'll do anything.

33:04.008 --> 33:05.125
Now what the hell would I want

33:05.127 --> 33:07.710
with you and your used up wife?

33:08.590 --> 33:10.507
But we have children!

33:11.752 --> 33:13.502
Shit, well so do I.

33:14.552 --> 33:17.719
Somewhere.

33:19.386 --> 33:21.136
They didn't scream.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.729
I like it when they scream.

33:25.731 --> 33:27.526
There'll be more, pumpkin.

33:30.872 --> 33:33.430
You said it was only
gonna be a few more miles.

33:33.432 --> 33:37.169
Yeah we'll definitely hit it by nightfall.

33:37.171 --> 33:40.921
The man's name is Briggs,
a mean old bastard,

33:41.888 --> 33:44.305
but no ties to the Disciples.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.308
They didn't want to mess with him.

33:47.310 --> 33:49.989
How do you know he's
gonna be friendly with us?

33:49.991 --> 33:51.052
There ain't no telling,

33:51.054 --> 33:54.188
but I'm gonna try to bribe
some information out of him.

33:54.190 --> 33:56.470
The man may be pure slime,

33:56.472 --> 34:00.188
but he has a strong
pulse on this wasteland.

34:00.190 --> 34:04.289
If your daughters are still
alive, he'll know something.

34:29.678 --> 34:30.594
Try some.

34:36.255 --> 34:37.088
Not bad.

34:38.676 --> 34:39.831
Let 'em cool down for a few minutes.

34:39.833 --> 34:42.166
I'm gonna grab us some beer.

35:04.164 --> 35:06.125
Gotcha, what's the matter?

35:06.127 --> 35:08.318
That's Isabelle, that's my daughter.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.987
I'll be goddamned!

35:11.124 --> 35:12.263
Isabelle!

35:12.265 --> 35:14.639
Shut your fucking mouth, mister!

35:14.641 --> 35:16.823
These folks are not
ones to be trifled with.

35:16.825 --> 35:18.458
We gotta get her, we gotta get her now.

35:18.460 --> 35:20.277
Hold on there, missy.

35:20.279 --> 35:22.138
We can't just blindly run in there.

35:22.140 --> 35:24.180
That's trespassing.

35:24.182 --> 35:28.218
These inbred sons of bitches
got more guns than the militia.

35:28.220 --> 35:29.818
So what do you propose?

35:29.820 --> 35:32.698
I'm gonna wander in there, like I'm lost.

35:32.700 --> 35:34.421
I'm gonna find Briggs,

35:34.423 --> 35:37.839
and I'll be real friendly to him.

35:37.841 --> 35:41.008
I'll be able to buy some time until...

35:44.359 --> 35:47.359
Sweetie, are you okay?
Fuck off.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.673
Sweetie.

35:52.161 --> 35:54.058
What have they done to you?

35:54.060 --> 35:55.643
It's Mom, it's Mom.

35:58.716 --> 35:59.737
Have they brainwashed you?

35:59.739 --> 36:01.406
Look, it's your mom!

36:02.338 --> 36:04.088
If you don't leave,

36:06.380 --> 36:08.630
I'll tell them to kill you.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.279
All of you.

36:19.281 --> 36:20.161
Tell who?

36:20.163 --> 36:25.163
Now what in the name of Jesse
James is going on back here?

36:26.531 --> 36:29.666
You find some new playthings, Izzy?

36:29.668 --> 36:31.501
Something like that.

36:34.515 --> 36:37.515
Where the hell did they come from?

36:41.294 --> 36:42.849
They're my parents.

36:42.851 --> 36:43.684
Hm.

36:45.373 --> 36:46.708
Hi Mom.

36:49.533 --> 36:51.711
Come on, let's eat.

37:02.607 --> 37:06.024
Isabelle, do you know where Desiree is?

37:09.750 --> 37:11.204
Please, Isabelle!

37:11.206 --> 37:13.604
Now that's enough, all right?

37:13.606 --> 37:14.607
If Izzy don't want to answer

37:14.609 --> 37:16.847
your questions, she don't have to.

37:16.849 --> 37:19.266
She's a grown woman out here.

37:27.006 --> 37:29.360
Izzy was saying you folks have money?

37:29.362 --> 37:30.195
Used to.

37:31.286 --> 37:32.619
What happened?

37:34.326 --> 37:37.076
Look around, what do you think?

37:39.198 --> 37:41.958
You know your mom's a real fucking bitch.

37:41.960 --> 37:45.793
She was a bitch before
our house burnt down.

37:49.379 --> 37:51.756
What's your pop's deal?

37:51.758 --> 37:53.841
He a retard or something?

37:57.299 --> 37:58.549
I don't know.

38:01.197 --> 38:04.030
At least he tried to stick around.

38:07.096 --> 38:10.118
Where's your ring, Isabelle?

38:10.120 --> 38:12.873
I don't see you wearing your ring.

38:12.875 --> 38:16.875
I mean, do you even know
what happened to David?

38:18.559 --> 38:19.809
I don't know.

38:22.860 --> 38:27.027
But I'm kind of off the
market at the moment, Mom.

38:32.638 --> 38:34.780
Come on, come on Charles.

38:41.834 --> 38:44.131
That is not my daughter.

38:44.133 --> 38:46.051
She was a straight A student.

38:46.053 --> 38:47.811
She didn't swear.

38:47.813 --> 38:49.293
She was engaged to a CEO

38:49.295 --> 38:52.209
of a tech company, for Christ's sake.

38:52.211 --> 38:55.769
All that shit means
nothing out here anymore.

38:55.771 --> 39:00.632
She's just trying to
survive, like the rest of us.

39:00.634 --> 39:05.134
What'd she mean when she
said you didn't stick around?

39:07.317 --> 39:08.150
Nothing.

39:15.615 --> 39:17.651
Why didn't you do anything?

39:17.653 --> 39:18.947
What?

39:18.949 --> 39:21.369
You just sit there all day!

39:21.371 --> 39:23.292
She's been brainwashed by some scum,

39:23.294 --> 39:26.672
and you just sit there
and you don't do anything!

39:26.674 --> 39:29.331
You bastard!
Hey, take it easy!

39:29.333 --> 39:30.416
Take it easy!

39:31.813 --> 39:33.396
It ain't his fault!

39:34.231 --> 39:35.651
I seen fellas eat their own fingers

39:35.653 --> 39:37.653
on account of radiation.

39:38.495 --> 39:42.162
He's doing all right,
all things considered.

39:46.410 --> 39:48.328
Don't you remember anything?

39:48.330 --> 39:51.528
Don't you remember your daughter's face?

39:51.530 --> 39:52.613
Some of it.

39:54.490 --> 39:57.323
What, what else do you remember?

39:58.166 --> 40:00.755
I remember you locking
yourself in the basement

40:00.757 --> 40:03.272
while all those thugs tried to kill us.

40:18.445 --> 40:20.945
A beautiful night, isn't it?

40:22.707 --> 40:24.683
Where's my daughter?

40:24.685 --> 40:27.139
Oh don't you worry about her.

40:27.141 --> 40:31.563
She's safely nestled,
getting her beauty sleep.

40:31.565 --> 40:34.482
We're leaving tomorrow, with her.

40:36.163 --> 40:38.705
Now why you gotta be so rude?

40:38.707 --> 40:42.353
I've invited you all
into my house as guests,

40:42.355 --> 40:45.344
provided food, shelter for you.

40:45.346 --> 40:46.759
What more do you want from me?

40:46.761 --> 40:50.860
So help me god, if she
tries to hold onto you

40:50.862 --> 40:53.362
I'll rip her fucking arms off!

40:56.765 --> 40:59.848
Why don't you take a look that way?

41:05.384 --> 41:07.717
Now take a look over yonder.

41:13.523 --> 41:17.745
You scream, and that's
all that's gonna hear you.

41:17.747 --> 41:20.822
A fucking black hole of nothing.

41:20.824 --> 41:23.803
All that matters is right here,

41:23.805 --> 41:26.422
and your daughter's happy.

41:26.424 --> 41:28.757
Let her live in that moment.

41:30.963 --> 41:33.130
I will kill you for her.

41:34.157 --> 41:36.225
Now you listen here, Mom.

41:36.227 --> 41:39.003
Izzy is now my property.

41:39.005 --> 41:41.403
She'll even say as such.

41:41.405 --> 41:44.039
Hell, we even talked about branding her,

41:44.041 --> 41:47.478
a tramp stamp right on that
tight little ass of hers.

41:47.480 --> 41:50.902
Property of Briggs Incorporated.

41:50.904 --> 41:54.683
It's got a nice ring
to it, don't you think?

41:54.685 --> 41:57.723
Now that you're part of the family,

41:57.725 --> 42:02.022
we're gonna set the
ground rules right here.

42:02.024 --> 42:04.818
As long as you're breathing any air

42:04.820 --> 42:07.781
what's in 100 yards of my person,

42:07.783 --> 42:10.362
you will do as I say.

42:10.364 --> 42:12.531
I'm a family man by trade,

42:13.401 --> 42:16.068
and I treat my family like gold.

42:17.245 --> 42:20.745
You will never have to feel excluded, Mom.

42:25.165 --> 42:26.332
Don't do this.

42:27.245 --> 42:31.141
This is a bigger game
than you know how to play.

42:31.143 --> 42:33.976
And I will win, every single time.

42:43.668 --> 42:45.418
Now go get some rest.

42:47.494 --> 42:49.732
Sweet dreams, Mom.

43:06.489 --> 43:08.156
We gotta kill him.

43:09.569 --> 43:11.652
As soon as the sun rises.

43:14.085 --> 43:14.918
I know.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.285
Almost got me a squirrel, Briggs.

43:50.287 --> 43:51.282
How many times I gotta tell you

43:51.284 --> 43:53.282
to use the goddamn shotgun, Carl.

43:53.284 --> 43:55.986
Oh, it makes Joshua nervous.

43:55.988 --> 43:58.146
I didn't want to have to unchain him.

43:58.148 --> 43:59.762
Jesus fucking Christ, Joshua's nervous

43:59.764 --> 44:02.226
'cause he ain't pinched
his daily shit yet.

44:02.228 --> 44:03.223
Why don't you unchain him

44:03.225 --> 44:04.445
and take him around the block a few times?

44:04.447 --> 44:05.447
The critters can wait.

44:05.449 --> 44:06.282
Yes sir.

44:11.985 --> 44:12.818
Goddamn.

44:22.226 --> 44:25.821
When you gonna take care
of the parental units?

44:25.823 --> 44:27.808
What do you mean?

44:27.810 --> 44:30.380
Your mom's a goddamn battleax.

44:30.382 --> 44:32.805
She ain't ever gonna play nice.

44:32.807 --> 44:35.445
So why don't you go over there,
say your last words to 'em

44:35.447 --> 44:37.584
so I can get to it.

44:37.586 --> 44:41.753
I don't like this negativity
filling my workplace.

44:44.487 --> 44:46.245
With pleasure.

44:46.247 --> 44:47.664
That's my girl.

45:04.238 --> 45:06.203
Briggs is gonna kill you all.

45:06.205 --> 45:08.922
If you're lucky, maybe I can
distract him for a minute

45:08.924 --> 45:12.786
while you run back in the
same direction you came.

45:12.788 --> 45:15.644
Either way, you have to leave.

45:15.646 --> 45:18.396
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

45:23.843 --> 45:27.119
It's too late for apologies, Sloan.

45:27.121 --> 45:28.401
Be grateful for the warning.

45:28.403 --> 45:30.403
You're coming with us.

45:31.284 --> 45:33.426
What does that piece of
shit have to offer you?

45:33.428 --> 45:35.383
The next time some whore
comes walking down the street,

45:35.385 --> 45:38.552
shaking her ass, he will toss you out.

45:39.582 --> 45:40.599
Frankly, I'm not too concerned

45:40.601 --> 45:43.018
with competition around here.

45:44.382 --> 45:48.965
I said my piece, feel free
to take my advice, or don't.

45:51.364 --> 45:53.281
I'll give you a minute.

45:56.621 --> 45:58.788
We have to kill him now.

45:59.901 --> 46:02.620
I got about three
handguns in here, loaded.

46:02.622 --> 46:04.365
How are you on ammunition?

46:04.367 --> 46:05.950
I need some more.

46:09.780 --> 46:11.122
Charles, you know how to shoot?

46:11.124 --> 46:11.957
No!

46:12.942 --> 46:14.802
Charles, you stay in here no matter what,

46:14.804 --> 46:17.052
do you understand me?

46:17.054 --> 46:17.887
Yes.

46:29.172 --> 46:30.728
What's the matter?

46:30.730 --> 46:31.563
Nothing.

46:32.752 --> 46:35.092
You tell 'em to leave?

46:35.094 --> 46:36.311
What'd they say?

46:36.313 --> 46:37.813
They're leaving.

46:39.312 --> 46:41.689
I wanted to ask you something.

46:41.691 --> 46:43.449
What is it?

46:43.451 --> 46:45.892
Come with me around the back.

46:45.894 --> 46:48.212
Got something to show you.

46:48.214 --> 46:50.714
Stole it from my dad's wallet.

46:58.934 --> 46:59.851
Briggs, no!

47:01.515 --> 47:04.772
Briggs!

47:09.691 --> 47:11.274
Goddamn!

47:19.030 --> 47:21.184
Izzy what the fuck was that?

47:21.186 --> 47:23.465
I didn't know they were armed!

47:26.267 --> 47:29.105
Intruders on the south
side, Briggs is hit.

47:40.191 --> 47:41.204
Fuck it.

48:05.946 --> 48:07.110
Briggs!

48:43.649 --> 48:45.149
Over easy!

48:53.423 --> 48:54.256
Briggs!

48:55.405 --> 48:56.238
Damn it!

48:57.339 --> 48:58.256
Goddamn it.

49:01.048 --> 49:02.381
Fucking asshole.

49:06.765 --> 49:08.432
Give me another gun.

49:09.443 --> 49:11.121
One of you assholes give me a gun!

49:48.020 --> 49:48.853
Briggs!

49:55.183 --> 49:56.600
Son of a bitch.

50:03.823 --> 50:06.156
No baby, please don't die.

50:08.026 --> 50:09.859
Please don't kill him!

50:10.826 --> 50:11.743
I love you.

50:12.981 --> 50:16.231
She won't kill you, she won't kill you.

50:17.283 --> 50:18.866
She won't kill you.

50:20.228 --> 50:21.061
Don't die.

50:22.326 --> 50:23.243
No, no, ah!

50:25.551 --> 50:28.718
Well you see Izzy, I'm already dead.

50:29.690 --> 50:32.045
You just make sure you
make this cunt's life

50:32.047 --> 50:35.048
miserable for as long as you can.

50:39.727 --> 50:41.060
No, you bitch!

50:42.506 --> 50:44.006
You fucking bitch!

50:47.078 --> 50:50.141
Charles, have you been hit?

50:50.143 --> 50:51.393
No.
Come on.

50:54.521 --> 50:55.438
Stay there.

51:42.319 --> 51:43.152
No.

51:55.833 --> 51:57.650
Sloan, I'm home.

51:57.652 --> 51:59.410
She's in the basement, Dad.

52:03.409 --> 52:05.492
Stay down, Rockefeller!

52:07.230 --> 52:08.563
Get off of me!

52:09.529 --> 52:12.967
Anybody else in the house?
No!

52:12.969 --> 52:14.951
There's money and jewelry upstairs.

52:14.953 --> 52:16.748
Just take it and leave.

52:16.750 --> 52:18.268
I won't call the police.

52:18.270 --> 52:19.831
You think I want your fucking money?

52:19.833 --> 52:20.664
Then what do you want then?

52:20.666 --> 52:22.231
Get off of me!

52:22.233 --> 52:23.741
Just take it and leave.

52:23.743 --> 52:25.325
We'll talk about this.

52:30.689 --> 52:32.106
What do I want?

52:39.371 --> 52:40.233
Get away from him!

52:40.235 --> 52:41.818
Shut the fuck up.

52:42.850 --> 52:44.212
Every time you write a check,

52:44.214 --> 52:46.410
every time you sip your
morning cappuccino,

52:46.412 --> 52:49.370
every time you pay your
fancy country club dues,

52:49.372 --> 52:51.991
I want you to see my face.

52:51.993 --> 52:54.431
I want you to remember that
that little piece of shit

52:54.433 --> 52:56.888
you stepped on to get
your plush corner office,

52:56.890 --> 53:00.821
well he's here to get
what's rightfully his.

53:00.823 --> 53:02.490
I've never seen you in my life.

53:02.492 --> 53:05.930
Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit,

53:05.932 --> 53:08.349
you're right, no you haven't.

53:09.370 --> 53:10.730
Would it matter if you did?

53:10.732 --> 53:12.831
I haven't seen you before today either,

53:12.833 --> 53:14.271
and this ain't personal.

53:14.273 --> 53:16.373
We just needed somewhere to start,

53:16.375 --> 53:18.015
and knowing the company you work for,

53:18.017 --> 53:19.653
seeing this lovely house

53:19.655 --> 53:22.191
and seeing how nice
you people are dressed,

53:22.193 --> 53:25.114
I think this is as good
a place as any to start.

53:25.116 --> 53:26.172
You get off him!

53:26.174 --> 53:29.055
Twinkie, quit that shit!

53:29.057 --> 53:30.655
I think we're gonna take her with us.

53:30.657 --> 53:33.231
Leave us alone!

53:33.233 --> 53:37.900
Hey Lyle, quit that piddly
shit and throw the mark up.

53:40.500 --> 53:42.583
Wait, don't!

53:46.263 --> 53:47.096
Don't!

53:50.204 --> 53:52.454
The revolution has begun!

53:55.357 --> 53:57.024
What's going, Dad!

53:58.119 --> 53:59.877
Desiree, get out!

53:59.879 --> 54:01.473
Dad are you okay?

54:06.023 --> 54:08.421
Right, everybody calm the fuck down!

54:08.423 --> 54:10.439
Now what's your neighbor's name?

54:10.441 --> 54:11.445
Fuck you!

54:11.447 --> 54:12.783
Oh.

54:16.221 --> 54:17.221
No, don't!

54:19.724 --> 54:20.555
Good.

54:20.557 --> 54:21.390
Now.

54:23.244 --> 54:25.802
You ever had a gun like this
pushed in your face before?

54:25.804 --> 54:29.119
You ever seen a gun up close
and personal like this?

54:29.121 --> 54:30.523
I don't think so.

54:30.525 --> 54:31.536
Me?

54:31.538 --> 54:33.781
I picked up my first pistol
when I was six years old.

54:33.783 --> 54:35.423
Shot my first pistol when I was 10.

54:35.425 --> 54:39.200
Hey, you know what my
daddy's last words were, huh?

54:39.202 --> 54:42.698
He said boy, you better put that gun down.

54:44.705 --> 54:45.761
You don't think it's funny?

54:45.763 --> 54:48.447
Oh you city folk, oh no sense of humor.

54:48.449 --> 54:49.903
I'm getting depressed just looking at you.

54:49.905 --> 54:51.365
Now Lyle!

54:51.367 --> 54:53.183
Why don't you take that nice
lady into the kitchen there,

54:53.185 --> 54:55.786
turn the gas on, and light this place up?

54:55.788 --> 54:56.943
We got four more houses on this street

54:56.945 --> 54:59.368
to hit before nightfall.

54:59.370 --> 55:01.275
Get off of her!

55:05.469 --> 55:06.302
Get off!

55:07.271 --> 55:08.309
Weeping Jesus Christ.

55:08.311 --> 55:12.368
Hey take your fucking
paws off of her, Twinkie!

55:12.370 --> 55:13.201
You fucking animal.

55:13.203 --> 55:14.656
Take your paws off of her!

55:14.658 --> 55:17.674
Please don't hurt them.
Shut the fuck up.

55:17.676 --> 55:20.357
Now, we ain't gonna kill any of you.

55:20.359 --> 55:22.736
We're gonna do something much worse.

55:22.738 --> 55:25.856
I want you to give me your phones,

55:25.858 --> 55:28.530
your fucking keys, your
wallets, your Kindles,

55:28.532 --> 55:30.315
your fucking cappuccino cards,

55:30.317 --> 55:32.400
whatever you fucking got!

55:33.810 --> 55:34.810
Your wallet?

55:36.196 --> 55:37.716
For what?

55:37.718 --> 55:40.301
Shut the fuck up, just do it.

55:45.837 --> 55:47.613
Where's your fucking phone?

55:47.615 --> 55:49.611
Oh my goodness gracious

55:49.613 --> 55:51.863
where's your fucking phone?

55:53.457 --> 55:55.294
Fucking iPhone 10 is it?

55:55.296 --> 55:56.463
All right now.

55:59.581 --> 56:01.797
Ladies and gentlemen!

56:01.799 --> 56:04.132
Consider yourself liberated.

56:05.318 --> 56:07.600
You are free to go.
Go where?

56:07.602 --> 56:08.928
Don't give a flying fuck.

56:08.930 --> 56:09.761
Don't go to the neighbors though.

56:09.763 --> 56:10.618
Don't get help.

56:10.620 --> 56:11.451
How are we gonna survive?

56:11.453 --> 56:13.520
Man shut the fuck up, hey Twinkie?

56:13.522 --> 56:14.795
Let her fucking go before I put a bullet

56:14.797 --> 56:17.322
between your fuckin' eyes.

56:17.324 --> 56:19.461
There's no houses for miles around here.

56:19.463 --> 56:20.581
I get kicked out of a dozen orphanages

56:20.583 --> 56:22.796
with nothing but the shirt on my back.

56:22.798 --> 56:25.440
I think you folks will be just fine.

56:25.442 --> 56:27.621
And if you're not, well,

56:27.623 --> 56:29.400
maybe it's for the best.

56:29.402 --> 56:30.858
What if we won't?

56:30.860 --> 56:32.421
Are you gonna kill all three of us?

56:32.423 --> 56:34.460
I got nothing better to do.

56:34.462 --> 56:36.000
Tick tock,

56:36.002 --> 56:36.835
tick tock,

56:37.900 --> 56:38.733
tick tock.

56:40.140 --> 56:42.320
Get up, get up!

56:42.322 --> 56:43.439
Dad!

56:43.441 --> 56:45.499
Tick tock, tick tock,

56:45.501 --> 56:47.802
why don't you leave that bag here?

56:47.804 --> 56:48.637
Tick tock.

56:51.544 --> 56:52.377
Tick tock.

56:55.664 --> 56:57.962
Tock, all right boys.

56:57.964 --> 56:59.099
Get the mattresses out of the bedroom

56:59.101 --> 57:00.103
and put 'em in the living area.

57:00.105 --> 57:03.241
We're gonna burn this place down.

57:03.243 --> 57:04.881
Let's fucking go!

57:26.417 --> 57:28.698
Where are we going?

57:28.700 --> 57:29.695
Anywhere.

57:29.697 --> 57:32.495
If you find a safe place
to lodge, let me know.

57:32.497 --> 57:34.733
Shouldn't we be looking for Desiree?

57:34.735 --> 57:36.917
We don't know where she is, Charles.

57:36.919 --> 57:38.836
Isabelle won't tell us.

57:39.996 --> 57:42.329
I don't know where she is!

57:45.239 --> 57:48.072
And if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

57:48.940 --> 57:52.794
She ran off like a coward, just like Dad.

57:52.796 --> 57:53.629
Hey!

57:55.100 --> 57:57.754
Your dad is not a coward!

57:57.756 --> 57:59.738
You're right, he's not.

57:59.740 --> 58:03.338
That honor is reserved entirely for you!

58:03.340 --> 58:04.352
He didn't lock himself away

58:04.354 --> 58:09.354
while his family was being
attacked, and almost murdered.

58:09.457 --> 58:11.295
You think I feel horrible?

58:11.297 --> 58:12.534
What was I supposed to do?

58:12.536 --> 58:13.578
There was three of them.

58:13.580 --> 58:14.597
It would've been lights out for me

58:14.599 --> 58:17.397
at the moment I went upstairs.

58:17.399 --> 58:19.418
Great excuse, Sloan.

58:19.420 --> 58:22.117
I hope that lets you sleep at night.

58:22.119 --> 58:23.036
Fuck you!

58:24.060 --> 58:27.919
Right back at you, you fucking bitch.

58:33.260 --> 58:36.657
♪ Now I lay myself to sleep ♪

58:36.659 --> 58:39.937
♪ I pray the lord my soul to keep ♪

58:39.939 --> 58:41.237
Charles, stop it.

58:41.239 --> 58:42.559
She's a grown woman.

58:42.561 --> 58:43.781
Just lay off of him.

58:43.783 --> 58:44.877
If he continues to act that way

58:44.879 --> 58:46.796
it's just gonna worsen.

58:48.422 --> 58:50.505
There is no recovering.

58:56.700 --> 58:58.617
He's fucked either way.

59:36.594 --> 59:38.911
Charles, where did she go?

59:38.913 --> 59:40.192
Where did she go?

59:40.194 --> 59:42.752
She ran off before the sun came up.

59:42.754 --> 59:47.491
Well did she say where,
or when she's coming back?

59:47.493 --> 59:48.990
You gotta tell me these things, Charles.

59:48.992 --> 59:50.715
You know better.

59:50.717 --> 59:51.717
I'm sorry.

59:53.997 --> 59:54.992
Can we go now?

59:54.994 --> 59:56.494
It's cold in here.

59:57.853 --> 59:58.686
Yeah.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:07.350
I think I know where she went.

01:00:07.352 --> 01:00:08.374
What?

01:00:08.376 --> 01:00:09.293
Isabelle.

01:00:10.674 --> 01:00:11.931
Where, where did she go?

01:00:11.933 --> 01:00:14.452
She got into the car, and they drove off.

01:00:14.454 --> 01:00:15.287
A car?

01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:18.830
Why the fuck didn't you wake me up?

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:20.670
It was far away.

01:00:20.672 --> 01:00:22.468
I think it was black and white.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.553
Did it sound like that?

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:32.049
Howdy folks.

01:00:35.282 --> 01:00:36.800
Pick up any passengers today?

01:00:36.802 --> 01:00:39.162
You're my first, name's Warcry,

01:00:39.164 --> 01:00:42.181
on account of you can
always hear me coming.

01:00:42.183 --> 01:00:43.499
I don't need to know your name.

01:00:43.501 --> 01:00:45.978
I'm just looking for someone.

01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:50.443
Well, cover more ground
if you'd just get in.

01:00:50.445 --> 01:00:52.843
If you don't mind the noise, that is.

01:00:52.845 --> 01:00:55.345
Charles, is this is the car?

01:00:58.845 --> 01:01:01.417
Look, we don't have much to
offer if you're okay with that.

01:01:01.419 --> 01:01:03.979
Hey not everybody out
here is a fucking asshole.

01:01:03.981 --> 01:01:04.814
Get in.

01:01:32.021 --> 01:01:34.640
How many other cars are around here?

01:01:34.642 --> 01:01:35.559
Not many.

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:39.964
Fuel's cherished more than
solid gold around these parts.

01:01:39.966 --> 01:01:42.124
I shouldn't actually be driving
out in the open like this.

01:01:42.126 --> 01:01:44.444
Who are you running from, Disciples?

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:45.863
Isn't everyone?

01:01:45.865 --> 01:01:46.860
I caught one of 'em trying to siphon gas

01:01:46.862 --> 01:01:48.903
out of my tank yesterday.

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.343
Had to put 'em down.

01:01:50.345 --> 01:01:53.040
Now they got extra reason to hunt me down.

01:01:53.042 --> 01:01:53.875
You armed?

01:01:55.004 --> 01:01:56.762
Look, I'm just saying.

01:01:56.764 --> 01:01:58.500
You gotta be ready for anything out here.

01:01:58.502 --> 01:02:00.263
You never know when
somebody's gonna emerge.

01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:03.380
That's the car!

01:02:05.785 --> 01:02:06.924
Are you sure?

01:02:06.926 --> 01:02:08.176
I'm positive.

01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:10.305
Shit!

01:02:10.307 --> 01:02:11.303
That's Diamondhead.

01:02:11.305 --> 01:02:12.563
He ain't no cop, though.

01:02:15.086 --> 01:02:16.844
I don't see her in the car.

01:02:16.846 --> 01:02:17.985
Maybe in the trunk.

01:02:17.987 --> 01:02:19.324
They ain't gonna let no slave ride shotgun

01:02:19.326 --> 01:02:21.084
on the way to the fortress.

01:02:51.007 --> 01:02:52.061
If you got any ammo in that bag,

01:02:52.063 --> 01:02:54.140
now's the time to use it.

01:02:54.142 --> 01:02:55.901
My daughter may be in that car.

01:02:55.903 --> 01:02:57.181
Don't shoot at the trunk then,

01:02:57.183 --> 01:02:58.941
just get him off my ass!

01:03:50.306 --> 01:03:51.139
Ahh.

01:03:52.728 --> 01:03:53.561
Come on!

01:04:26.537 --> 01:04:29.104
What the hell is that?
Shit.

01:04:29.106 --> 01:04:30.461
That's Skin and Juice.

01:04:30.463 --> 01:04:31.789
Their son's the one I caught yesterday

01:04:31.791 --> 01:04:33.405
trying to siphon my tank.

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:37.303
Greetings and salutations, motherfuckers!

01:04:47.149 --> 01:04:47.982
Come on!

01:04:48.889 --> 01:04:51.825
Come on, you're fucking done!

01:04:53.886 --> 01:04:57.047
You're fucking done, Warcry!

01:04:57.049 --> 01:04:59.716
Nobody sleeps on Skin and Juice!

01:05:03.550 --> 01:05:05.050
Fucking civilians!

01:05:44.047 --> 01:05:44.880
Come on!

01:05:52.553 --> 01:05:53.386
Fuck!

01:05:54.931 --> 01:05:55.767
Honey?

01:05:59.667 --> 01:06:03.167
It jammed, it's fucking jammed, goddamnit!

01:06:07.369 --> 01:06:10.036
Goddamn it, reload motherfucker!

01:06:19.907 --> 01:06:21.083
He's still behind us.

01:06:24.605 --> 01:06:26.726
Get him off my ass!

01:06:47.235 --> 01:06:48.895
Ready, I think I can run it!

01:07:43.703 --> 01:07:45.953
What a lousy fucking day.

01:07:49.648 --> 01:07:52.065
Come on you son of a bitch!

01:07:57.864 --> 01:07:59.364
Ah, god.

01:08:26.694 --> 01:08:27.861
Fucking bitch.

01:08:36.912 --> 01:08:38.372
Just put me out of my fucking misery.

01:08:57.957 --> 01:08:59.818
Where is she?

01:08:59.819 --> 01:09:02.487
Pound dirt, you cunt and twat.

01:09:03.877 --> 01:09:05.390
Ahh!

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.058
I don't know who the fuck
you're talking about,

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:15.537
but she's either tied up or dead.

01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.477
The Disciples run a tight ship.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:20.657
How far up the road is the fortress?

01:09:20.658 --> 01:09:24.492
I won't give you the
slightest satisfaction.

01:09:26.822 --> 01:09:30.654
I'm coming, baby.

01:09:35.286 --> 01:09:36.618
Come on, yeah!

01:10:45.864 --> 01:10:46.781
Isabelle!

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.937
Don't bother with me.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:26.280
I'm just gonna slow you down.

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.019
Charles, how are you?

01:11:32.021 --> 01:11:34.040
Have you been hit?

01:11:34.042 --> 01:11:35.625
I don't think so.

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.819
Come on, we gotta keep looking.

01:12:12.793 --> 01:12:14.293
You guys hungry?

01:12:55.048 --> 01:12:57.913
So you folks looking for a good time?

01:12:57.915 --> 01:12:59.411
No.

01:12:59.413 --> 01:13:02.452
But we appreciate the help.

01:13:02.454 --> 01:13:03.892
But look, we don't have any money,

01:13:03.894 --> 01:13:06.612
but maybe we can find something to trade.

01:13:06.614 --> 01:13:09.031
Well what are you offering?

01:13:10.429 --> 01:13:12.313
This tall glass of water for sale?

01:13:12.315 --> 01:13:14.271
No, he's a happily married man.

01:13:14.273 --> 01:13:19.273
Oh, ain't no such thing as
institutions around here, hon.

01:13:19.974 --> 01:13:21.474
My name's Pretzel.

01:13:22.475 --> 01:13:23.642
This is Spoon.

01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:27.971
What do you call yourselves?

01:13:27.973 --> 01:13:29.847
Look, I'm not much in conversation.

01:13:29.849 --> 01:13:32.599
Let's just get where we're going.

01:13:33.435 --> 01:13:34.951
Let's go.

01:13:34.953 --> 01:13:36.536
You asked for it.

01:13:38.668 --> 01:13:40.212
Come on, Charles.

01:13:58.095 --> 01:13:58.928
Hi baby.

01:14:04.191 --> 01:14:05.274
What's wrong?

01:14:17.302 --> 01:14:19.498
Look, we're looking for
the Disciples fortress.

01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:21.856
Man, y'all still got a ways to go.

01:14:21.858 --> 01:14:24.100
Why don't you two just
spend the night here?

01:14:24.102 --> 01:14:26.269
Head out tomorrow morning.

01:14:27.424 --> 01:14:28.462
Where did you find them?

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:31.714
Same place we found you, hitchhiking.

01:14:32.579 --> 01:14:34.698
But you safe though, girl.

01:14:34.700 --> 01:14:37.102
Hell, I got enough meat
and pussy around here

01:14:37.104 --> 01:14:39.321
than I know what to do with.

01:14:40.993 --> 01:14:44.296
What business you got with
the Disciples for anyway?

01:14:44.298 --> 01:14:45.976
Two common folk like you gonna fuck around

01:14:45.978 --> 01:14:47.853
and go up there and get killed,

01:14:47.855 --> 01:14:50.253
especially when you armed and whatnot.

01:14:50.255 --> 01:14:54.666
You're from the Alma suburbs, aren't you?

01:14:54.668 --> 01:14:58.549
Yeah, I think I used to see the two of you

01:14:58.551 --> 01:15:01.429
around there quite often.

01:15:01.431 --> 01:15:03.809
We used to live there.

01:15:03.811 --> 01:15:05.964
You're from Alma?

01:15:05.966 --> 01:15:07.029
You don't look like it.

01:15:07.031 --> 01:15:08.448
Neither do you.

01:15:09.852 --> 01:15:13.370
I used to have a plush job, comfy savings.

01:15:13.372 --> 01:15:17.930
You think I like living like
this, like a fucking animal?

01:15:17.932 --> 01:15:21.850
It's something we've
quickly grown accustomed to.

01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:24.184
I suggest the two of you
toughen up real quick,

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.389
or you're not gonna make
it out of here alive.

01:15:26.391 --> 01:15:28.608
If you can't beat 'em, you gotta join 'em.

01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:30.549
The hell you keep looking at her for?

01:15:30.551 --> 01:15:33.610
I don't know, she looks familiar.

01:15:33.612 --> 01:15:34.608
Where'd you find her?

01:15:34.610 --> 01:15:36.810
The hell you care.

01:15:36.812 --> 01:15:38.848
I'm just curious.

01:15:38.850 --> 01:15:39.683
Well?

01:15:41.148 --> 01:15:45.210
We call her Pookie,
because she's just as cute

01:15:45.212 --> 01:15:47.226
as a little teddy bear,

01:15:47.228 --> 01:15:50.389
but just as fucking useless.

01:15:50.391 --> 01:15:52.224
She usually deals with my soiled laundry,

01:15:52.226 --> 01:15:56.643
and Spoon has his way with
her when he's in the mood.

01:15:59.570 --> 01:16:01.050
Enough about me, let's eat.

01:16:36.641 --> 01:16:40.339
You gotta treat 'em like
animals, 'cause they are animals.

01:16:40.341 --> 01:16:42.341
You goddamn filthy dogs!

01:16:43.897 --> 01:16:48.421
You better savor that, let
alone have some goddamn manners.

01:16:48.423 --> 01:16:50.261
There ain't that many
hogs left around here.

01:16:50.263 --> 01:16:51.096
Hey!

01:16:52.098 --> 01:16:54.515
He hasn't eaten for two days.

01:17:00.604 --> 01:17:03.018
Why the hell do you keep looking at her?

01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.282
Yeah, maybe she used to be a nightingale,

01:17:04.284 --> 01:17:07.802
but now she's just a pile of trash.

01:17:07.804 --> 01:17:09.253
Is she contaminated?

01:17:29.125 --> 01:17:29.958
Spoon.

01:17:38.157 --> 01:17:39.952
Oh easy, darling!

01:17:39.954 --> 01:17:41.621
You look over there?

01:17:45.554 --> 01:17:47.270
Hey you take it easy, now.

01:17:47.272 --> 01:17:48.710
What you want with Pookie?

01:17:48.712 --> 01:17:52.294
Oh Spoon, don't you see the resemblance?

01:17:52.296 --> 01:17:54.328
Well you ain't taking her, regardless.

01:17:54.330 --> 01:17:55.334
What do you care?

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:56.547
You called her worthless!

01:17:56.549 --> 01:17:59.430
Well maybe I like the decorations.

01:17:59.432 --> 01:18:01.189
Desiree, Desiree!

01:18:01.191 --> 01:18:02.272
It's your mother!

01:18:02.274 --> 01:18:05.051
Oh she's not gonna respond.

01:18:05.053 --> 01:18:06.467
We've hit her over the head so many times,

01:18:06.469 --> 01:18:08.802
she can't even hear no more.

01:18:10.808 --> 01:18:14.166
I swear to god, if you don't
go over there and untie her,

01:18:14.168 --> 01:18:16.486
I will fucking break her arm in two!

01:18:16.488 --> 01:18:17.963
And a pig's ass!

01:18:17.965 --> 01:18:20.199
Honey, just put the gun down.

01:18:20.201 --> 01:18:22.144
She's a lot stronger than she looks.

01:18:52.105 --> 01:18:53.188
No, no, no!

01:18:57.443 --> 01:18:58.526
Oh ho, yes!

01:19:10.048 --> 01:19:10.881
Charles!

01:19:15.412 --> 01:19:16.628
Charles?

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:21.787
Charles!

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:25.146
She's dead.

01:19:42.345 --> 01:19:43.345
I see you.

01:19:53.257 --> 01:19:54.757
Let's go, Charles.

01:19:55.598 --> 01:19:58.681
Stop looking at her, I said let's go!

01:20:01.983 --> 01:20:03.650
Oh baby.

01:20:08.622 --> 01:20:09.455
Baby!

01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.533
Baby!

01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:26.074
Baby!

01:20:27.337 --> 01:20:28.170
Baby?

01:20:42.496 --> 01:20:43.329
Charles.

01:20:45.658 --> 01:20:46.491
Charles?

01:20:51.178 --> 01:20:52.011
Charles.

01:21:58.032 --> 01:22:01.115
Hey, hey hey, I don't have much left.

01:22:02.896 --> 01:22:03.727
What's your name?

01:22:05.555 --> 01:22:06.388
Heather.

01:22:08.355 --> 01:22:10.188
Is the fortress far?

01:22:11.251 --> 01:22:13.089
I'm headed there myself, actually.

01:22:13.091 --> 01:22:16.129
Only place with open
food and water I know of.

01:22:16.131 --> 01:22:18.209
You don't look like a Disciple.

01:22:18.211 --> 01:22:20.786
They're just gonna chain you up.

01:22:20.788 --> 01:22:22.871
Better than being dead.

01:22:24.195 --> 01:22:25.249
You from Alma?

01:22:25.251 --> 01:22:26.834
Close, Brigadier.

01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:31.415
That was the first sip of
water I've had in days.

01:22:31.417 --> 01:22:34.334
I haven't eaten in over a week now.

01:22:35.614 --> 01:22:37.895
Why are you headed there?

01:22:37.897 --> 01:22:39.397
Family business.

01:22:41.577 --> 01:22:43.196
What kind of radiation he got?

01:22:43.198 --> 01:22:44.855
Some forms are contagious.

01:22:44.857 --> 01:22:47.034
He's not contagious.

01:22:47.036 --> 01:22:49.411
I'm not taking any chances.

01:22:49.413 --> 01:22:50.746
Suit yourself.

01:22:52.057 --> 01:22:54.140
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:22:56.718 --> 01:22:59.570
I'm about to collapse if
I continue on by myself.

01:22:59.572 --> 01:23:01.330
What do you have to offer us?

01:23:01.332 --> 01:23:02.695
I don't know what I can offer you,

01:23:02.697 --> 01:23:05.364
but you look like decent people.

01:23:08.613 --> 01:23:09.446
Are ya?

01:23:12.638 --> 01:23:13.713
Come on.

01:23:22.894 --> 01:23:26.227
Our daughter may be held prisoner there.

01:23:27.630 --> 01:23:31.569
If so, we're gonna have
to take her by force.

01:23:31.571 --> 01:23:33.586
Do you know how to use a weapon?

01:23:33.588 --> 01:23:36.505
I'll be upfront with ya, I can't.

01:23:37.353 --> 01:23:39.489
We'll have to use you for some diversion.

01:23:39.491 --> 01:23:40.929
Whatever I can do to help.

01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:42.668
You know I was a secretary for 15 years,

01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:45.532
and then a stay a home mom for five.

01:23:45.534 --> 01:23:48.551
I've never even been camping before.

01:23:48.553 --> 01:23:51.303
So you're worthless, we get it.

01:23:56.014 --> 01:23:57.008
That's it, you can see it

01:23:57.010 --> 01:23:59.177
just past the trees, look.

01:24:00.894 --> 01:24:02.003
All right, I see three Disciples.

01:24:02.005 --> 01:24:04.163
There's probably more around back.

01:24:04.165 --> 01:24:06.639
How should we proceed?

01:24:06.641 --> 01:24:07.801
All right, just watch him.

01:24:07.803 --> 01:24:08.803
I'll be right back.

01:24:08.805 --> 01:24:10.707
Oh when will you be back?

01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:13.027
How long should we wait?

01:24:13.029 --> 01:24:14.504
Just stay here.

01:24:14.506 --> 01:24:15.891
I'm gonna go see if I can see Isabelle,

01:24:15.893 --> 01:24:17.464
then I'll be right back.

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:50.142
Now mister, everything's
gonna be all right.

01:24:50.144 --> 01:24:51.960
You must be so scared.

01:24:51.962 --> 01:24:53.422
You never told me your name.

01:25:29.587 --> 01:25:31.201
Oh sweet Jesus!

01:25:31.203 --> 01:25:32.241
Where do you come from?

01:25:32.243 --> 01:25:33.701
We were just walking down
that road over yonder,

01:25:33.703 --> 01:25:36.036
and stopped to take a break.

01:25:36.963 --> 01:25:38.963
Anybody else with you?

01:25:44.104 --> 01:25:45.687
Is he contaminated?

01:25:51.886 --> 01:25:52.719
Charles!

01:25:54.004 --> 01:25:55.171
Shut her up.

01:25:57.647 --> 01:25:59.064
Take her to Penn.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:14.773
Charles, Charles, Charles.

01:26:18.099 --> 01:26:20.266
I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry.

01:26:21.997 --> 01:26:23.432
Where's Heather?

01:26:23.434 --> 01:26:25.739
Did Heather do this to you?

01:26:25.741 --> 01:26:27.741
Well howdy, strangers.

01:26:30.216 --> 01:26:31.351
What's a couple of nice folks like you

01:26:31.353 --> 01:26:33.718
doing all the way out here?

01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:35.398
We're just looking for food and water.

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:40.315
What makes you think I'd give
you anything, nightingale?

01:26:40.317 --> 01:26:41.150
Oh shit!

01:26:42.141 --> 01:26:43.857
He doesn't look too well.

01:26:43.859 --> 01:26:46.026
He destroyed our family!

01:26:53.459 --> 01:26:55.233
What'd he ever do to you?

01:26:55.235 --> 01:26:57.934
He did a lot of things, ma'am.

01:26:57.936 --> 01:26:58.955
Now me?

01:26:58.957 --> 01:27:01.274
I'm just finishing what I started.

01:27:01.276 --> 01:27:02.679
I wouldn't be much of a revolutionary now

01:27:02.681 --> 01:27:04.278
if I didn't, would I?

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:05.556
That's right.

01:27:05.558 --> 01:27:08.513
Now I may not remember all of my actions,

01:27:08.515 --> 01:27:12.114
but I surely do remember my first.

01:27:12.116 --> 01:27:15.595
It's quite an honor,
breaking into your home,

01:27:15.597 --> 01:27:18.872
terrorizing your lovely
husband and daughters.

01:27:18.874 --> 01:27:21.041
I'm sorry you missed that.

01:27:24.418 --> 01:27:25.585
Oh wait, wait.

01:27:27.677 --> 01:27:30.118
Were you hiding in the house that day?

01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:33.537
Oh I bet you were, you were, weren't you?

01:27:35.462 --> 01:27:37.757
Well I gotta hand it to them,

01:27:37.759 --> 01:27:40.281
they didn't give you up or nothing,

01:27:40.283 --> 01:27:44.923
not even with death
breathing down their necks.

01:27:44.925 --> 01:27:46.508
Well he's dead now.

01:27:49.883 --> 01:27:51.883
I did him a favor.

01:27:51.885 --> 01:27:54.948
He was gonna be dead
in a few days, anyway.

01:27:54.950 --> 01:27:58.492
That there is stage four brain rot.

01:27:58.494 --> 01:27:59.494
I should know.

01:27:59.496 --> 01:28:01.663
I see it almost every day.

01:28:06.254 --> 01:28:09.150
Now we ain't gonna kill you,

01:28:09.152 --> 01:28:11.235
'cause you're too strong.

01:28:12.195 --> 01:28:13.334
And the Disciples, well they love

01:28:13.336 --> 01:28:15.753
a strong woman by their side.

01:28:17.214 --> 01:28:20.033
And unlike your husband's company,

01:28:20.035 --> 01:28:23.285
we are an equal opportunities employer.

01:28:26.515 --> 01:28:29.713
I bet you learned from
the experience, though.

01:28:29.715 --> 01:28:33.465
Living like me and my
family did for decades.

01:28:35.176 --> 01:28:37.574
You can thank me later, ma'am.

01:28:37.576 --> 01:28:39.334
It does build character.

01:28:44.414 --> 01:28:46.171
Stop your lying, Twinkie!

01:28:48.462 --> 01:28:50.907
You fucking dumb cunt!

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:52.459
You realize what you've done?

01:28:52.461 --> 01:28:55.206
I'm the closest thing to a
god this country got left.

01:28:55.208 --> 01:28:57.606
I brought balance, you rich bitch.

01:29:00.888 --> 01:29:02.406
Oh you're dead now, honey.

01:29:51.916 --> 01:29:53.999
Goddamn it, ah!

01:30:28.442 --> 01:30:29.275
Damn it.

01:30:30.799 --> 01:30:32.397
Hey!

01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:38.756
Goddamn it.

01:30:40.992 --> 01:30:41.825
Get up.

01:31:25.442 --> 01:31:29.525
Is there anyone inside I
should be worried about?

01:31:32.221 --> 01:31:33.945
Is my daughter inside?

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:36.281
Who?
My daughter.

01:31:36.283 --> 01:31:38.361
Her name is Isabelle.

01:31:38.363 --> 01:31:40.389
Can you even remember?

01:31:40.391 --> 01:31:42.298
Yeah, I remember.

01:31:42.300 --> 01:31:43.354
She's not inside, though.

01:31:43.356 --> 01:31:45.523
I don't know where she is.

01:31:46.359 --> 01:31:49.442
Look, I'm gonna need to see a doctor.

01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:53.051
Then you shouldn't have run.

01:31:53.053 --> 01:31:56.432
I'm gonna lose my leg if
this shit gets infected.

01:31:56.434 --> 01:31:58.879
Do you know of a hospital around here?

01:31:58.881 --> 01:32:01.214
No, we burnt 'em all down.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:06.120
I tell you what,

01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.338
I'm gonna go inside that mansion

01:32:08.340 --> 01:32:11.301
and I'm gonna pack up
everything I can carry,

01:32:11.303 --> 01:32:13.199
and then we're gonna go
look for my daughter.

01:32:13.201 --> 01:32:15.115
Are you out of your fucking mind, lady?

01:32:15.117 --> 01:32:18.762
I can barely stand on my own two feet.

01:32:18.764 --> 01:32:20.101
Do you have a better idea?

01:32:20.103 --> 01:32:23.242
Yeah, we live like king and
queens up in this posh pad.

01:32:23.244 --> 01:32:25.722
I mean, Penn's dead, his goons are dead.

01:32:25.724 --> 01:32:28.901
Ain't nobody gonna bother us.

01:32:28.903 --> 01:32:33.423
Yeah, you see that
doesn't sit right with me.

01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:35.621
You're too goddamned ugly.

01:32:35.623 --> 01:32:36.623
So what are you gonna do?

01:32:36.625 --> 01:32:38.281
You just gonna go on
some wild goose chase?

01:32:38.283 --> 01:32:41.541
Who knows where your fucking daughter is?

01:32:41.543 --> 01:32:43.460
Nothing better to do.

01:32:52.684 --> 01:32:57.684
