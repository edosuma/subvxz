WEBVTT

00:03.568 --> 00:05.179
<i>The science fiction writer
Arthur C. Clarke</i>

00:05.222 --> 00:07.659
<i>said this about aliens,</i>

00:07.703 --> 00:10.140
<i>"Two possibilities exist.</i>

00:10.184 --> 00:12.186
<i>Either, we are alone
in the universe</i>

00:12.229 --> 00:14.579
<i>or we're not.</i>

00:14.623 --> 00:16.712
<i>-Both are equally terrifying."</i>

00:22.892 --> 00:24.807
Mom, come on.
It's almost time for the game.

00:33.903 --> 00:35.078
Polly's out there, Mom.

00:37.298 --> 00:39.561
We don't even know if that was
her blood on the phone booth.

00:39.604 --> 00:42.172
She called us
from that booth a half hour
before we got there.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.608
Who else's blood would it be?

00:43.652 --> 00:45.915
We'll find out
when the FBI calls me back

00:45.958 --> 00:48.265
with their analysis.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.354
Maybe you should get back
into your support group

00:50.398 --> 00:52.400
with all of those other moms.

01:11.462 --> 01:12.637
All right. Bring it in.

01:17.599 --> 01:19.296
We lost again.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.994
We totally could've been
practicing for regionals,

01:22.038 --> 01:24.736
instead of wasting
our time here.

01:24.780 --> 01:26.956
I couldn't agree more,
Cassandra.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.829
Could not agree more.

01:35.182 --> 01:37.619
All right, guys,
that was another tough one.

01:37.662 --> 01:39.751
But the Baxter High Ravens
are number two in the league.

01:39.795 --> 01:41.405
You guys fought hard out there.

01:41.449 --> 01:43.625
Keep fighting. We're gonna
break through. All right?

01:43.668 --> 01:45.801
While I do believe
Coach Andrews

01:45.844 --> 01:48.760
is the best motivator
a Gridiron Gang could ask for,

01:48.804 --> 01:50.110
as your de facto team owner,

01:50.153 --> 01:52.199
what can I do
to incentivize you?

01:54.636 --> 01:57.421
How about ten grand

01:57.465 --> 02:00.598
to whichever Bulldog
scores first this season?

02:02.905 --> 02:04.472
All right?

02:09.738 --> 02:10.782
You okay, Derek?

02:10.826 --> 02:12.132
I'll be all right.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.176
It just sucks to lose, Coach.

02:13.220 --> 02:14.308
I'm giving it my all.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.179
I hear you, man.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.834
There was
no better player than you
out on that field today.

02:22.751 --> 02:23.839
<i>Seriously,
what do we do?</i>

02:23.882 --> 02:24.840
Push them more?

02:27.234 --> 02:28.800
I'm already
running them ragged.

02:28.844 --> 02:30.976
Not to mention,
there's zero fan support.

02:31.020 --> 02:33.283
The Bulldogs were supposed
to inspire the town

02:33.327 --> 02:35.677
and Riverdale was supposed
to rally behind the Bulldogs,

02:35.720 --> 02:37.200
but no one even comes
to our games.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.897
In that case,

02:38.941 --> 02:41.073
I'll get the town to back
our Bulldogs again.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.163
You just keep those kids
motivated, Coach.

02:45.774 --> 02:46.775
What about me?

02:48.255 --> 02:49.865
Don't coaches
need motivation too?

02:54.043 --> 02:55.175
Chin up, Andrews.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.094
<i>And the incidents,
they go back decades, Samm.</i>

03:02.138 --> 03:04.096
There's dozens of people
seeing things
they can't explain.

03:04.140 --> 03:05.533
There's even support groups.

03:05.576 --> 03:06.751
Slow down, Jones.

03:06.795 --> 03:08.231
You're writing
about aliens now?

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
Yeah, but it's
not just about aliens.

03:09.928 --> 03:11.756
It's about personal trauma.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.194
And if I'm right,
it's about a town's
collective trauma.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.326
<i>Could you please just take
the idea to Scribners?</i>

03:16.370 --> 03:18.328
Y-Yeah, I'll let you know
what they say.

03:18.372 --> 03:19.764
Thank you. I appreciate it.

03:28.730 --> 03:30.427
Tabitha.

03:30.471 --> 03:34.126
How do you feel about Pop's
hosting a pancake breakfast

03:34.170 --> 03:35.606
so that folks
can mix and mingle

03:35.650 --> 03:37.434
with the new and improved
Riverdale Bulldogs?

03:37.478 --> 03:38.914
Sounds fun.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.611
And if it brings in
warm bodies, then great.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.265
Amazing!

03:42.309 --> 03:43.875
And what if, hypothetically,

03:43.919 --> 03:46.051
Pop's became
the official sponsor

03:46.095 --> 03:46.922
of the Bulldogs?

03:49.490 --> 03:50.882
Let's give it a shot.

03:50.926 --> 03:52.884
I like supporting underdogs.

03:52.928 --> 03:55.060
I will express order
the pancake mix and the syrup.

03:55.104 --> 03:57.628
Oh, no. No.
Don't order the syrup.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.413
I have
a special supplier for that.

03:59.456 --> 04:02.067
I'm sorry, but I cannot donate
my precious maple resource

04:02.111 --> 04:04.244
to help fund that collection
of tatterdemalions

04:04.287 --> 04:06.246
you call
a football team, Archie.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.944
Moreover,
the Vixens can no longer,
in good conscience,

04:08.987 --> 04:10.815
continue cheering for
the bad news Bulldogs.

04:10.859 --> 04:12.077
Cheryl, please.

04:12.121 --> 04:13.731
Just stick around
for one more game

04:13.775 --> 04:15.385
and maybe help get
some more people in the stands.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.432
My Vixens are cheerleaders,
not boosters, Archie.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.477
Fine. I'll do it myself.

04:21.435 --> 04:22.566
Hi, Ms. Bell

04:22.610 --> 04:23.611
Can you turn this on, please?

04:27.528 --> 04:29.312
<i>Attention, everyone.
This is Coach Andrews.</i>

04:29.356 --> 04:31.401
You may not know this,
but a bunch of your classmates

04:31.445 --> 04:33.403
are out there
busting their asses
on the football field

04:33.447 --> 04:34.839
to represent this school

04:34.883 --> 04:37.407
and to represent
each and every one of you.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.017
<i>So why don't you all
show some school spirit</i>

04:39.061 --> 04:40.497
<i>and support your team.</i>

04:40.541 --> 04:41.629
<i>Starting with...</i>

04:41.672 --> 04:43.674
<i>the free pancake breakfast</i>

04:43.718 --> 04:45.285
<i>that Pop's is hosting
tomorrow morning.</i>

04:45.328 --> 04:48.940
Give them your support.
And, hell...

04:48.984 --> 04:50.812
you might even get something
out of it yourselves.

04:55.164 --> 04:57.035
And what about the Vixens?

04:57.079 --> 04:58.036
One more game.

04:59.255 --> 05:00.996
I'll even come out
of retirement

05:01.039 --> 05:03.128
to give the people something
they'd actually like to see.

05:03.172 --> 05:04.652
Namely, <i>moi.</i>

05:08.699 --> 05:11.311
But first,
there's something broken
I need to fix.

05:13.008 --> 05:14.879
Don't forget to turn in
your short story assignments

05:14.923 --> 05:16.054
on the way out, guys.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.189
Thank you.

05:22.539 --> 05:24.498
Good job. Thank you.

05:43.908 --> 05:46.084
Glen.

05:46.128 --> 05:47.782
Did you get the blood results
from the phone booth back?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.654
I did.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
The recovered blood
is AB-negative.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.179
The rarest type.

05:54.223 --> 05:56.007
Under one percent
of the population.

05:56.051 --> 05:57.661
And a match for Polly.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.231
So, she... She's really...

06:02.274 --> 06:03.711
I'm so sorry, Betty.

06:07.932 --> 06:10.282
No, you're not.

06:10.326 --> 06:13.416
If you had cared at all
about me or my sister,

06:13.460 --> 06:15.766
you would have done something
to help me.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.377
Betty, look,
I realize you're upset--

06:17.420 --> 06:18.552
Screw you, Glen.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.567
I must admit,

06:33.610 --> 06:35.438
it is a bit disturbing.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.267
Waldo, a kid is held captive
by mole people.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.400
Only to escape

06:40.443 --> 06:42.619
and be abducted by
a family of mothmen

06:42.663 --> 06:44.752
who operate on him
in a spaceship,

06:44.795 --> 06:46.144
in graphic detail.

06:46.188 --> 06:47.711
Doesn't it ring
any alarm bells for you?

06:47.755 --> 06:49.583
But the child survives.

06:49.626 --> 06:51.541
He's found on the side
of the highway.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.064
What do we know about Lerman?

06:53.108 --> 06:55.153
Well, he's a good student,
average grades.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.939
Is there any trouble at home?

06:57.982 --> 07:01.812
He has sustained
a substantial number
of injuries.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.162
A broken arm, a black eye,

07:04.206 --> 07:05.468
was on crutches for a while.

07:07.862 --> 07:09.907
I know what you're thinking,
Mr. Jones,

07:09.951 --> 07:13.302
but I spoke to Lerman
and his parents.

07:13.345 --> 07:14.651
They couldn't be nicer people.

07:14.695 --> 07:16.087
So what?
He's just accident prone?

07:16.131 --> 07:17.349
And then what about this story?

07:17.393 --> 07:19.264
Some kids get hurt a lot.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.179
And, yes...

07:21.223 --> 07:24.182
sometimes a story
is just a story.

07:30.667 --> 07:31.538
Order up.

07:33.148 --> 07:34.671
Behold. 'Tis the nectar
of the gods.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.630
Amazing!
Thank you again.

07:39.371 --> 07:40.460
Enjoy.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.505
Thank you.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.768
We're feeling optimistic
about the rest of the season,
Mrs. Davis.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.204
And your son plays
a huge part in that.

07:46.248 --> 07:47.945
Which is why, Derek,

07:47.989 --> 07:49.686
-I want you to be
captain of the team.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.863
And what's the team gonna do
for my son, Coach Andrews?

07:52.907 --> 07:54.517
Uh, I'm not sure I understand.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.824
Derek's a damn good player.

07:56.867 --> 07:59.348
And football could be
his ticket out of this town.

07:59.391 --> 08:02.351
-He could get a scholarship--
-Mom, chill!

08:02.394 --> 08:04.527
I have to think
of my son's future, Coach.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.008
Not just your team's.

08:08.183 --> 08:09.184
Excuse me.

08:10.838 --> 08:12.622
No, I understand.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.971
So sorry to interrupt.

08:14.015 --> 08:16.365
Coach, we have a situation.

08:25.679 --> 08:27.985
I take it you didn't come
for the hotcakes, Reginald?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.683
No.

08:29.726 --> 08:31.511
I'm here on behalf of

08:31.554 --> 08:32.860
the Greater Rockland County
High School Football League.

08:32.903 --> 08:34.731
The eight other teams
in the conference

08:34.775 --> 08:37.865
and our commissioner saw fit
to send me as a representative.

08:38.866 --> 08:39.997
We're all in agreement.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.564
We'd like for the Bulldogs

08:41.608 --> 08:44.393
to withdraw from the league
like... yesterday.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.004
You guys, uh, suck.

08:47.048 --> 08:48.440
Screw you, Reggie.

08:48.484 --> 08:50.051
Riverdale has a right to play.

08:50.094 --> 08:53.358
Come on, Andrews.
The Bulldogs are
an embarrassment.

08:53.402 --> 08:55.535
They're tainting
the league's prestige.

08:55.578 --> 08:58.712
So, can we tell the league
you're withdrawing?

08:58.755 --> 09:00.583
Like hell.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.194
I want the names
of every member of
this so-called league.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.719
Doesn't it kill you, Coach?

09:05.762 --> 09:07.895
To watch the Bulldogs
lose week after week.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.419
Yeah. Well, it's not
all about winning, Reg.

09:13.117 --> 09:14.466
Keep telling
yourself that, loser.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.469
Loser. Loser. Loser.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.876
Y-You want to talk about it?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.400
A few days ago,
you were getting married
and having a kid,

09:35.444 --> 09:38.578
and now, uh...
Now we're moving you out.

09:38.621 --> 09:41.015
It was my decision, you know.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.279
Maybe you're right, Dad.
Maybe...

09:44.322 --> 09:45.846
I'm not the kind of guy
who deserves a family.

09:46.760 --> 09:47.804
Hold on, now.

09:47.848 --> 09:49.632
You, you don't really believe

09:49.676 --> 09:51.678
that you don't deserve
happiness now, do you?

09:56.117 --> 09:57.597
You know what, Dad,
I actually don't want
to talk about it.

10:00.948 --> 10:02.906
Given how invested you are

10:02.950 --> 10:05.735
in seeing Riverdale High fail
on all fronts,

10:05.779 --> 10:07.258
I find it hard to believe
you're not behind

10:07.302 --> 10:09.130
the league's attempt
to oust the Bulldogs.

10:09.173 --> 10:11.959
All I know about the Bulldogs
is that they're garbage

10:12.002 --> 10:14.091
and that they haven't even
scored this season.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.441
They will against
your precious Stallions.

10:16.485 --> 10:18.139
Oh, please.

10:18.182 --> 10:21.316
We'll be wiping Bulldog blood
off our cleats for weeks.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.798
You seem so sure.

10:26.495 --> 10:27.757
How about a wager?

10:27.801 --> 10:30.107
Ooh. What are the terms?

10:30.151 --> 10:31.631
If your Stallions

10:31.674 --> 10:34.808
keep my Bulldogs
off the scoreboard,

10:34.851 --> 10:37.637
we'll withdraw
from the league, voluntarily.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.682
If, however, we do score,

10:39.726 --> 10:41.945
you'll have to convince
your good friend,

10:41.989 --> 10:44.339
the commissioner,
and his legion of doom,

10:44.382 --> 10:46.646
to stop trying
to muscle out the Bulldogs.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.387
I will take that bet.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.651
Great.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.013
Hey, Lerman.
Could you hang back for a sec?

11:12.715 --> 11:13.629
Story is great.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.024
It's very vivid, it's intense.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.330
I wanted to ask you
what inspired it.

11:19.374 --> 11:22.507
Uh, just a series
of dreams I had.

11:22.551 --> 11:24.814
Really? Recurring?

11:24.858 --> 11:27.338
Yes. Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.166
Now some experts believe that

11:29.210 --> 11:32.169
stories about aliens
and the like

11:32.213 --> 11:35.825
are really about traumas
that people have experienced

11:35.869 --> 11:37.784
and that these stories
are cries for help.

11:39.220 --> 11:42.702
What? What do you...
What do you mean?

11:42.745 --> 11:46.227
I mean,
is this story real, Lerman?

11:46.270 --> 11:47.358
Any part of it?

11:47.402 --> 11:48.359
Did someone hurt you?

11:48.403 --> 11:49.709
Like what you wrote about

11:49.752 --> 11:51.754
or tie you up,
or keep you locked up?

11:51.798 --> 11:52.668
Mr. Jones...

11:54.104 --> 11:55.889
it's just a story. Okay?

11:55.932 --> 11:59.066
I...
I never should've
written it. I'm sorry.

12:00.067 --> 12:00.894
Sorry. I have to go.

12:06.073 --> 12:08.466
Sweet cousin,
what a surprise.

12:11.992 --> 12:14.298
Any news on your fair sister?

12:14.342 --> 12:15.604
Yeah. As a matter of fact,

12:15.647 --> 12:17.301
that's why I'm here, Cheryl.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.481
When Jason first disappeared,

12:23.525 --> 12:25.483
for a long time,
no one knew where he was

12:25.527 --> 12:28.095
or what had happened to him.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.880
But when you learned
that he had died,

12:30.924 --> 12:32.708
was it helpful
to know the truth?

12:35.624 --> 12:37.757
To say it was soul-crushing

12:37.800 --> 12:39.193
would be an understatement.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.809
So what if you'd never
learned the truth?

12:46.853 --> 12:49.377
If you had had hope
that he might still be alive?

12:50.639 --> 12:52.815
When I learned the truth,

12:52.859 --> 12:56.253
I was able to grieve
for my brother.

12:56.297 --> 13:01.606
From my experience,
it is better to know the truth

13:01.650 --> 13:03.347
and make your peace with it.

13:09.658 --> 13:10.702
Does this mean Polly's...

13:16.491 --> 13:18.580
I don't know what
it's gonna do to my mom.

13:29.896 --> 13:31.332
What's going on?

13:31.375 --> 13:33.029
Why aren't you guys
dressed for practice?

13:33.073 --> 13:35.336
Derek transferred.

13:35.379 --> 13:37.817
He got recruited to play
for Stonewall Prep.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.297
We're doomed.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.696
As much as
I hate Stonewall Prep,

13:47.739 --> 13:49.393
I can't blame Derek.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.395
Enrolling there,
playing for the Stallions.

13:52.788 --> 13:54.355
It's his best shot at college.

13:54.398 --> 13:56.879
And they're a team
that wins games.

13:57.924 --> 14:00.361
The Bulldogs will be, too.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.232
You've only
just re-launched them.

14:02.276 --> 14:04.669
Not to mention,
we're down a player.

14:04.713 --> 14:06.584
The league won't even let us
on the field with ten.

14:08.195 --> 14:09.674
It seems to me
like the Bulldogs

14:09.718 --> 14:12.329
just need a little motivation.

14:12.373 --> 14:14.244
Something to
get them energized.

14:17.378 --> 14:18.901
Luckily...

14:18.945 --> 14:21.991
I just came up
with one of my genius ideas

14:22.035 --> 14:23.340
that will rally the troops

14:23.384 --> 14:25.734
and maybe even
recruit some new ones.

14:37.224 --> 14:38.225
Mom.

14:40.575 --> 14:41.489
Mom.

14:46.581 --> 14:48.235
We got the blood results back.

14:51.412 --> 14:52.543
Is it Polly's?

14:57.287 --> 14:58.158
No.

15:01.465 --> 15:04.729
No, it was O-positive.

15:04.773 --> 15:05.817
It wasn't a match.

15:12.955 --> 15:14.783
Oh, thank God!

15:16.611 --> 15:18.134
Thank God!

15:18.178 --> 15:19.701
Oh, thank you, Betty.

15:40.156 --> 15:41.157
Hey, you're awake.

15:41.201 --> 15:42.637
Perfect timing.

15:42.680 --> 15:43.943
I ordered a platter
of cold cuts from Pop's.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.292
Would you mind running
to get it?

15:46.510 --> 15:47.947
What's happening?

15:47.990 --> 15:49.774
Oh, I decided
you were right about me

15:49.818 --> 15:52.429
getting back into
the support group.
I'm hosting today.

15:52.473 --> 15:54.040
Would you mind running
to get the cold cuts?

15:56.564 --> 15:58.174
Yeah. No. Of course.

16:00.655 --> 16:01.743
What's the buzz, Waldo?

16:02.483 --> 16:03.788
It was him?

16:03.832 --> 16:06.008
Mr. Jones,
these are the Logans.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.444
Lerman's parents.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.447
Oh, hi.

16:10.491 --> 16:13.798
They've come in to discuss
a conversation you had
with their son.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.191
In what world, Mr. Jones,

16:15.235 --> 16:16.714
do you think
that it's appropriate

16:16.758 --> 16:18.629
to encourage
these wild fantasies

16:18.673 --> 16:19.979
that Lerman is obsessed with?

16:20.022 --> 16:23.721
Death and aliens
and underground monsters?

16:23.765 --> 16:25.114
What's wrong with you?

16:25.158 --> 16:26.986
Well, I'm sorry.

16:27.029 --> 16:29.989
I'd figured
it was my responsibility
as Lerman's teacher.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.034
The story he wrote...

16:32.078 --> 16:34.036
might've been alluding
to some troubles at home.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.385
Then why didn't you come to us?

16:36.517 --> 16:38.388
Instead, you ambush our child?

16:38.432 --> 16:40.303
Mr. and Mrs. Logan,

16:40.347 --> 16:43.219
Mr. Jones' behavior
was wildly inappropriate.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.743
But I can promise you
that it will never
happen again.

16:45.787 --> 16:47.484
Oh, we know it won't,

16:47.528 --> 16:49.921
because we don't want him
teaching our child.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.185
Now, wait.
I didn't reach out to your so--

16:52.228 --> 16:53.577
Not a problem at all.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.188
We'll move Lerman
to another English class.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.497
How dare you break protocol
in such a reckless manner!

17:00.541 --> 17:02.673
I told you, I had already
vetted the Logans.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.893
I know. No. I'm sorry. I...

17:04.936 --> 17:06.721
I felt like something was off.

17:06.764 --> 17:07.852
My instinct was telling me
something strange was going on.

17:07.896 --> 17:09.767
One more misstep...

17:09.811 --> 17:11.595
I mean,
even just a little one...

17:13.075 --> 17:14.120
and you're done at my school.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.601
<i>Kevin. Fangs.</i>

17:17.645 --> 17:20.387
Thank you both for agreeing
to this tete-a-tete.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.867
Toni may never forgive me,

17:22.911 --> 17:25.087
but I will never forgive myself

17:25.131 --> 17:26.349
if I don't try to repair

17:26.393 --> 17:28.221
what my antics
have torn asunder.

17:28.264 --> 17:31.093
Namely, hashtag Kangs.

17:31.137 --> 17:33.965
Your games brought up
deeper issues between
Kevin and I.

17:34.009 --> 17:36.272
-Agreed.
-See? Consensus.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.058
Go on, Fangs.

17:39.101 --> 17:41.060
You've never been all in,
Kevin.

17:41.103 --> 17:43.366
Y-You've always,
always held back.

17:43.410 --> 17:45.194
And I don't know
if that's because of me

17:45.238 --> 17:47.370
or if it's because
you're ashamed of being gay.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.546
I am not ashamed
of being gay.

17:49.590 --> 17:50.939
Dude, you go to the woods,

17:50.982 --> 17:52.897
you hook up
with anonymous strangers.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.986
You don't want to be
in a real relationship

17:55.030 --> 17:56.075
with a real gay guy.

17:56.118 --> 17:57.685
Fangs, don't.

17:58.425 --> 17:59.774
You're not me.

17:59.817 --> 18:01.776
You don't know
my experience, okay?

18:01.819 --> 18:04.257
We were about
to get married, Kevin.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.910
I want to know
everything about you,

18:05.954 --> 18:07.129
the good and the bad.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.000
I think it's too late for that.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.959
-Kevin, please.
I gotta go.

18:11.002 --> 18:13.440
Cheryl, please butt out
of our lives.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.143
What? Are you having a party

18:21.187 --> 18:22.101
and I wasn't invited?

18:24.451 --> 18:27.018
No. Um, it's for
my mom's support group.

18:27.671 --> 18:28.629
How's she doing?

18:28.672 --> 18:30.500
Uh...

18:32.502 --> 18:34.809
there've been... developments

18:36.158 --> 18:37.768
in Polly's case.

18:37.812 --> 18:41.424
Um, apparently,

18:41.468 --> 18:43.600
the blood they recovered

18:43.644 --> 18:44.645
at the phone booth

18:45.863 --> 18:47.517
is a match for hers.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.955
Which means
most likely that, um...

18:50.999 --> 18:54.263
Oh, God. Betty, I'm so sorry.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.613
And the worst part is,
she disappeared four weeks ago,

18:56.657 --> 19:00.139
which means she has
or had been alive

19:01.009 --> 19:02.315
that entire time,

19:02.358 --> 19:05.187
somewhere along
the Lonely Highway.

19:05.231 --> 19:07.798
So I just didn't do enough.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.801
Hey, I actually met
someone that lives on
the Lonely Highway.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.325
I mean,
he's kind of an eccentric kook,

19:12.368 --> 19:14.979
but he sees a lot of
what goes on out there.

19:15.023 --> 19:18.287
Maybe he might've seen
or heard something
about the missing girls.

19:18.331 --> 19:20.681
If you want,
I can put this tray on ice,
and I can...

19:20.724 --> 19:21.899
take you to go meet him.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.164
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

19:28.863 --> 19:30.169
All right. Bring it in.

19:30.212 --> 19:31.909
What's the point
in practicing, Coach?

19:31.953 --> 19:33.911
We don't even have
enough players anymore.

19:33.955 --> 19:35.652
Bulldogs are a team, Britta.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.654
We play for each other
and for the love of the game.

19:37.698 --> 19:40.918
Yoo-hoo! Got room for one more?

19:40.962 --> 19:43.486
Bulldogs, I wanna introduce you
to a friend of mine

19:43.530 --> 19:45.227
who plays professional football

19:45.271 --> 19:47.403
for a little team
called the New York Goliaths.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.318
-Holy crap!

19:49.362 --> 19:51.364
It's T Dub!

19:51.407 --> 19:53.235
Wow! It's a pleasure
to meet you, bro.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.410
You're one hell of a player.

19:54.454 --> 19:56.107
Oh, man. I appreciate it.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.544
Heard you're one hell
of a coach.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.110
How are you even here?

19:59.154 --> 20:00.677
Ronnie and I go way back.

20:00.721 --> 20:02.940
T Dub was one of
my most loyal clients

20:02.984 --> 20:04.855
when I was selling jewelry
in New York.

20:04.899 --> 20:06.901
Hey. Uh, is it cool
if I say a few words
to the team?

20:06.944 --> 20:08.250
Yeah, please.

20:10.078 --> 20:12.211
Some of you might've seen me
play for the Goliaths,

20:12.254 --> 20:15.562
but my career started off
in a small town
just like Riverdale,

20:15.605 --> 20:17.825
with a coach who pushed me
to be what I could be.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.610
He believed in me.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.526
Just like Coach Andrews
believes in you.

20:23.570 --> 20:27.356
But you gotta be the ones
to make it happen on the field.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.358
You're not underdogs.

20:29.402 --> 20:30.707
You're the damn Bulldogs!

20:30.751 --> 20:32.231
Yeah!

20:32.274 --> 20:33.232
Y'all ready to prove
these haters wrong?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.886
Yeah!

20:35.930 --> 20:37.888
You must be Britta.

20:37.932 --> 20:38.976
Heard you got a cannon.

20:40.108 --> 20:41.457
Come on. Let's see.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.288
This might be the shot
in the arm we needed, Ronnie.

20:46.332 --> 20:48.812
I just wish T Dub
could suit up for us.
We're still short a player.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.988
Oh, Archiekins, not for long.

20:51.032 --> 20:53.426
Behold, a group
of Bulldogs-to-be.

20:58.605 --> 21:00.389
Hey...

21:00.433 --> 21:04.959
-who wants to play football?

21:05.002 --> 21:06.134
<i>We have a problem.</i>

21:06.177 --> 21:07.962
The interest in the Bulldogs

21:08.005 --> 21:09.398
is growing, not waning.

21:09.442 --> 21:11.574
I do not want people

21:11.618 --> 21:14.273
rallying around this team
or that school

21:14.316 --> 21:15.839
or that town.

21:15.883 --> 21:18.320
I want you to target
their weakest link

21:18.364 --> 21:19.974
and knock some heads.

21:20.975 --> 21:22.933
We don't need to go there.

21:22.977 --> 21:24.500
We're still gonna
crush the Bulldogs

21:24.544 --> 21:27.938
on the field
fair and square. Easy.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.115
Your loyalty lies with me.
At Stonewall.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.857
Yeah, but I'm not gonna
break some kid's legs
for no reason.

21:34.467 --> 21:35.685
Yeah.

21:38.079 --> 21:41.169
Consider yourself benched,
Reggie.

21:41.212 --> 21:44.346
I'll be leading Stallions
into battle against
Riverdale High.

21:47.654 --> 21:49.656
So be it.

21:49.699 --> 21:51.658
I'll be standing
with the Bulldogs, then.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.142
<i>What were you doing
out here?</i>

21:58.186 --> 22:00.493
Just working on a book.

22:00.536 --> 22:02.625
So, the old-timer
that owns this place

22:02.669 --> 22:04.192
has been here for decades.

22:05.585 --> 22:07.369
Mr. Dreyfuss, hi.

22:07.413 --> 22:11.025
-Jughead Jones,
you remember me?
-'Course I do.

22:11.068 --> 22:12.853
Great. This is Betty Cooper.

22:12.896 --> 22:15.159
She's a friend of mine,
from the FBI.

22:15.203 --> 22:17.336
-We were hoping that you could
help us with an investigation.
-Come on up.

22:19.076 --> 22:20.687
We're
one hundred percent certain

22:20.730 --> 22:22.906
that my sister made a call
from the payphone

22:22.950 --> 22:24.343
on the Lonely Highway.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.910
But when we got there,
it was destroyed.

22:26.954 --> 22:28.695
Shredded? Like a tin can?

22:29.696 --> 22:31.001
Exactly, yeah.

22:31.045 --> 22:32.481
Have you seen that before?

22:32.525 --> 22:34.222
Back in the summer of '77.

22:34.265 --> 22:37.007
And again in '82.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.835
I know what happened
to your sister.

22:38.879 --> 22:40.489
She's had an encounter.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.839
Yes, right.
But... But with who?

22:42.883 --> 22:44.711
The mothmen.

22:45.581 --> 22:47.714
I'm sorry. The mothmen?

22:49.977 --> 22:51.370
What makes you say that?

22:52.066 --> 22:54.024
The phone booth.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.504
You see,

22:55.548 --> 22:59.682
their ships use
anti-matter fusion reactors

22:59.726 --> 23:03.512
that create
a gravity field that, uh,

23:03.556 --> 23:07.429
that allows them to levitate,
like, like a balloon.

23:07.473 --> 23:10.389
But anything that gets caught
in that stasis,

23:10.432 --> 23:15.132
well, it gets crushed,
like it's made
out of papier-mache.

23:15.176 --> 23:17.091
I knew our friends
were back in town.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.789
I've been pickin' up
their chatter on my radios.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.274
That was a colossal
waste of time.

23:26.317 --> 23:28.624
Look, a lot of people
believe this stuff.
And there is some evidence.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.409
My sister went missing, Jug.

23:30.452 --> 23:33.412
She was taken by someone.
Not some thing.

23:33.455 --> 23:34.587
What are you even saying?

23:34.630 --> 23:36.284
I'm saying that things happen,

23:36.327 --> 23:38.808
especially in Riverdale,
that you and I can't explain.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.810
Sometimes, there isn't
a logical explanation.

23:40.854 --> 23:44.771
-Sometimes,
unexplained phenomenon--
-No, someone is...

23:44.814 --> 23:47.469
kidnapping, torturing,
and murdering women,

23:47.513 --> 23:49.297
that's not a phenomenon.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.994
It's just pure evil.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.257
But I'll be damned if I let it
happen to anyone else.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.956
Can you hurry up?
I need to get back
to Riverdale.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.628
<i>Because I care about you.</i>

24:15.671 --> 24:17.456
<i>You don't live here.</i>

24:17.499 --> 24:19.022
<i>You deserted us.</i>

24:19.066 --> 24:21.460
<i>Okay, being a real sister</i>

24:21.503 --> 24:23.113
<i>doesn't mean coming in
for one day and telling me
how to live my life.</i>

24:23.157 --> 24:26.160
<i>Especially when you don't know anything about it.</i>

24:26.203 --> 24:28.205
<i>My daughter is alive!</i>

24:28.249 --> 24:30.686
<i>-She called--
Betty, you
have to help me.</i>

24:30.730 --> 24:32.949
<i>I don't know,
I ran as fast as I could.
You have to come get me.</i>

24:32.993 --> 24:36.387
<i>Polly, I wanna tell you
that I love you,</i>

24:36.431 --> 24:37.954
<i>and that I'm here for you,</i>

24:37.998 --> 24:40.391
<i>just please, please,
please come home.</i>

25:17.777 --> 25:19.169
Hey, how's it going?

25:19.213 --> 25:21.868
Good, good.

25:21.911 --> 25:24.523
I haven't seen you
in here before.

25:24.566 --> 25:27.177
My name's Shane.
I'm visiting from LA.

25:27.221 --> 25:29.223
Ah. Well...

25:32.095 --> 25:34.663
I guess it's true
what they say about LA guys.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.404
Oh, what's that?

25:37.579 --> 25:40.713
That they're... hot.

25:40.756 --> 25:43.977
And what to they say
about guys from Riverdale?

25:46.327 --> 25:48.155
Why don't you tell me?

25:50.505 --> 25:51.724
-What the hell are you doing?
-Oh.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.203
Uh, I'm sorry.

25:53.247 --> 25:54.857
I must've misread
the situation. I thought--

25:54.901 --> 25:56.685
-You thought I was like you?
-No.

25:56.729 --> 25:58.600
-You thought I wanted you?
-No.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.210
You think I came here
to be groped
by your pathetic ass.

26:00.254 --> 26:02.299
No, no--

26:33.766 --> 26:36.464
-What the hell?
-Hey! What are you doing?

26:36.507 --> 26:39.249
Saving your life,
whether you want it
saved or not.

26:39.293 --> 26:40.947
Get the hell out of here.

26:44.037 --> 26:46.082
You're leaving
these girls alone,

26:46.126 --> 26:47.910
and you're never
coming back here again.

26:47.954 --> 26:49.912
Hey, these girls are the ones
looking to trick.

26:52.698 --> 26:55.265
Tell your dirtbag friends

26:55.309 --> 26:57.137
the party's over.

27:01.358 --> 27:02.621
Put a little ice on it.

27:04.361 --> 27:06.625
These bruises will settle down
in a few days.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.715
You keep those cuts clean.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.981
-Thanks, Dad.
-You're a grown man.

27:18.201 --> 27:20.029
And as your father...

27:22.249 --> 27:24.251
I'm terrified for you
right now.

27:25.513 --> 27:26.645
What's going on, son?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.998
I think...

27:33.216 --> 27:35.001
I'm ashamed of myself...

27:38.874 --> 27:40.528
of being gay.

27:40.571 --> 27:42.704
Is this something
that... that I did?

27:42.748 --> 27:43.705
No.

27:43.749 --> 27:46.316
No, Dad. No.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.971
It isn't your fault, okay?

27:49.015 --> 27:51.191
You've... you've always
accepted me.

27:51.234 --> 27:52.888
You've never judged me.

27:58.546 --> 28:01.854
-But, Mom--
-What? What happened?

28:02.855 --> 28:04.857
There was this one time...

28:06.032 --> 28:08.512
we were
back-to-school shopping.

28:08.556 --> 28:11.167
And she made

28:11.211 --> 28:14.605
some offhand comment.

28:14.649 --> 28:18.218
Like, about needing
to buy me...

28:20.611 --> 28:22.396
husky clothes.

28:24.050 --> 28:25.529
I don't know.

28:25.573 --> 28:28.010
Man, I just felt...

28:28.054 --> 28:30.796
like, so ashamed.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.063
So, I, uh...

28:39.239 --> 28:41.720
I told her I was meeting Betty.

28:41.763 --> 28:45.288
And I went to Fox Forest...
to be alone.

28:48.335 --> 28:50.380
I didn't even know
it was a cruising spot.

28:50.424 --> 28:53.383
And there was this
other guy there,

28:53.427 --> 28:56.778
and he was telling me
I was cute...

28:56.822 --> 28:57.910
or whatever.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.653
And it was like...

29:04.612 --> 29:07.615
all the stuff Mom said,
just washed away.

29:10.096 --> 29:14.274
And ever since then,
I... I've been cruising.

29:15.623 --> 29:17.886
It's like I'm hardwired
this way,

29:17.930 --> 29:20.106
or something.

29:20.846 --> 29:22.673
I don't know.

29:45.044 --> 29:46.654
Get out. Now.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.833
You--

29:51.877 --> 29:54.444
-You're not Patty.
-No, I'm her sister.

29:54.488 --> 29:56.272
You can't do this.
You can't arrest me again.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.274
You let me go.
You got nothing on me.

29:58.318 --> 30:00.146
You're right, John.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.017
I'm not gonna arrest you.

30:02.061 --> 30:04.367
But you are coming with me.

30:13.986 --> 30:15.291
Waldo, what's going on?

30:15.335 --> 30:16.640
Jughead, is Lerman with you?

30:16.684 --> 30:17.946
What?

30:17.990 --> 30:19.643
No, definitely not.

30:19.687 --> 30:21.384
I've been steering clear
with him. Why?

30:21.428 --> 30:23.822
His parents just called me.
They think Lerman ran away.

30:23.865 --> 30:25.388
<i>Any idea where he might be?</i>

30:25.432 --> 30:26.999
Oh, God, no.
I haven't talked to him.

30:27.042 --> 30:29.349
Tell the Logans that I'm
calling in some help, okay?

30:30.524 --> 30:34.310
Come on.

30:34.354 --> 30:36.008
Please don't do this.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.580
I told you.
I don't know where Patty is.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.495
What? Why are you doing this?

30:45.539 --> 30:50.718
-You really
have to ask me that?

30:50.761 --> 30:53.199
You are still preying

30:53.242 --> 30:54.591
on these girls.

30:54.635 --> 30:56.202
Exactly the same way

30:56.245 --> 30:58.378
you preyed on Polly.

30:58.421 --> 30:59.770
I have a family.

31:03.426 --> 31:04.732
I had a sister.

31:07.822 --> 31:11.521
No one looked out
for those girls.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.349
No one was protecting them.

31:13.393 --> 31:15.786
I couldn't even protect Polly.

31:19.312 --> 31:21.140
But I can deliver justice.

31:41.682 --> 31:43.945
-Jughead?
-Betty. Hey,
this is an emergency.

31:43.989 --> 31:46.121
One of my student is missing,
and I think
he's on the Lonely Highway.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.080
I'm on the highway.

31:48.123 --> 31:50.560
I'm ten miles north of town.

31:50.604 --> 31:52.432
I'm leaving
from town right now.
I'll meet you halfway.

31:52.475 --> 31:54.521
<i>-Who is it?
-Lerman Logan, he's 14.</i>

31:57.611 --> 31:59.091
I'm on my way.

32:09.144 --> 32:11.451
I'll send someone
to come untie you tomorrow.

32:13.453 --> 32:14.933
If I remember.

32:21.678 --> 32:24.246
<i>Here are
the Stonewall Stallions</i>

32:24.290 --> 32:26.814
<i>versus the Riverdale Bulldogs.</i>

32:28.294 --> 32:29.295
Let's go.

32:30.818 --> 32:31.645
Go. Go.

32:49.054 --> 32:51.795
Lerman. Thank God.

32:51.839 --> 32:55.321
Yeah, he was walking
on the shoulder in a daze.

32:57.888 --> 32:59.325
You okay, bud?

33:00.587 --> 33:02.589
Mr. Jones...

33:04.025 --> 33:05.244
did it happen again?

33:12.903 --> 33:15.123
Thank you
for finding Lerman.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.126
We'd hoped you wouldn't
have to go through this again.

33:18.170 --> 33:19.998
-Again?
-Yeah, Lerman is a sleepwalker.

33:21.086 --> 33:23.131
Has been since he was little.

33:23.175 --> 33:25.481
We thought he grew out of it,
but, uh...

33:25.525 --> 33:26.743
then he started
hurting himself.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.658
He walked into a door.

33:28.702 --> 33:31.139
Another time,
he burned his hand
on the stove.

33:31.183 --> 33:33.837
Even fell out of a window once
and broke his arm.

33:33.881 --> 33:36.710
So, we started locking
his bedroom door at night.

33:36.753 --> 33:39.843
Now, we gave him
the whole basement
to himself.

33:39.887 --> 33:42.063
We just... We made sure
he was safe.

33:42.107 --> 33:44.674
So you were the "Mole People"
who were keeping him locked up.

33:44.718 --> 33:46.328
All we've done is try our best
to protect him.

33:46.372 --> 33:48.417
I remember we were so terrified

33:48.461 --> 33:51.072
after that morning
we found the front door open

33:51.116 --> 33:52.552
and, and...

33:53.814 --> 33:56.164
Lerman was just gone.

33:56.208 --> 33:59.602
That whole week,
we thought we lost my boy.

33:59.646 --> 34:01.909
No, wait. He left
in the middle of the night
and was missing for a week?

34:01.952 --> 34:04.042
Where did he go?
What happened to him?

34:04.085 --> 34:06.479
A good Samaritan
found him wandering
the Lonely Highway...

34:09.308 --> 34:10.918
with no memory
of the prior week.

34:10.961 --> 34:13.616
That's why we were so upset
with you, Mr. Jones.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.227
We thought your questioning
might trigger...

34:15.270 --> 34:18.056
Well, something
like this happening.

34:19.753 --> 34:21.929
God only knows
what draws him to that highway.

34:26.803 --> 34:30.068
I don't think
it's a coincidence, Jug.

34:30.111 --> 34:33.201
Polly and Lerman both end up
on the Lonely Highway? No way.

34:33.245 --> 34:35.421
I agree. But what are
the other connections?

34:35.464 --> 34:37.945
When Polly escaped
and made that phone call,

34:37.988 --> 34:41.601
my mom said,
she described being in

34:41.644 --> 34:44.778
what sounded like
an alien spaceship.

34:44.821 --> 34:46.649
Seriously?

34:46.693 --> 34:48.434
They could've been abducted
by the same person.

34:48.477 --> 34:50.566
Why would they keep Polly
but let Lerman go?

34:50.610 --> 34:51.915
Well, maybe he escaped.

34:51.959 --> 34:53.221
Which is why
we need to find out

34:53.265 --> 34:55.136
what Lerman knows
about that missing week.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.007
Yeah, we're going to have to
exhaust every possible option

34:57.051 --> 34:59.923
no matter how insane
it might seem.

Circle up. Circle up.
Circle up, come on.

37:07.486 --> 37:09.139
Look at me.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.403
Hey, look at me. Don't worry
about the scoreboard.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.579
I don't care what it says.
You guys are playing
with heart.

37:13.622 --> 37:14.928
You're leaving it
all out there.

37:14.971 --> 37:16.538
That is all I could ever
ask from you.

37:16.582 --> 37:17.626
But listen,

37:17.670 --> 37:19.411
this is your moment.

37:19.454 --> 37:20.890
The whole town is behind you.

37:20.934 --> 37:23.153
The people in those stands
are here for you!

37:23.197 --> 37:24.372
Your teammates
are here for you!

37:24.416 --> 37:25.895
I'm here for you!

37:25.939 --> 37:27.897
And we're not gonna give up
on each other.

37:27.941 --> 37:29.464
If you don't give up
on yourself,

37:29.508 --> 37:30.900
then guess what?

37:30.944 --> 37:32.598
You can't lose.

37:32.641 --> 37:34.382
If you don't give up
on yourself,
you cannot lose.

37:34.426 --> 37:36.254
This game is not over.
Keep your head up.

37:36.297 --> 37:37.907
Let's go out there
and make something happen.

37:37.951 --> 37:39.561
Let's make this a night
we'll remember forever.

37:39.605 --> 37:41.259
This game is not over.
Come on, bring it in.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.739
-Britta, on you.
-Bulldogs, on three!

37:43.783 --> 37:45.654
One, two, three!

37:45.698 --> 37:48.091
-Bulldogs!
-Get out there, and make
something happen. Come on!

37:51.007 --> 37:52.966

39:31.760 --> 39:33.109
Archie!

39:35.416 --> 39:36.852
Heck of a game, Coach.

39:36.896 --> 39:38.854
Yeah? What game
were you watching?

39:38.898 --> 39:41.030
Well, the Bulldogs
may not have triumphed
on the scoreboard,

39:41.074 --> 39:44.686
but I'd say we've started
to win over the hearts
and minds of the town.

39:44.730 --> 39:47.123
And thanks
to a little side wager
with my father,

39:47.167 --> 39:50.083
the rest of the league
will no longer demand
that we withdraw.

39:51.171 --> 39:52.912
Ronnie for the win.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.873
I, just, uh...

39:57.917 --> 39:59.875
I just wanted to say,
good game, Coach.

39:59.919 --> 40:02.051
Hey. Thanks, Derek.
You played great out there.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.314
What do you think, Ronnie?
Kid's got wheels, huh?

40:04.358 --> 40:05.925
He sure does.

40:05.968 --> 40:08.144
Just remember. Keep working.
Keep getting better.

40:08.188 --> 40:10.190
I promise I will, Coach.
Just like you taught me.

40:19.112 --> 40:21.941
Waldo, this is becoming
sort of a regular thing
for us?

40:21.984 --> 40:24.247
So it seems.

40:24.291 --> 40:26.075
But I just wanted
to let you know

40:26.119 --> 40:28.643
that Lerman's parents
have pulled him out of school.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.558
They've left Riverdale.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.560
My God. Where'd they go?

40:32.604 --> 40:35.345
They left me a message,
but no forwarding address

40:35.389 --> 40:37.565
or contact information.

40:37.609 --> 40:39.393
I suppose they wanted
a fresh start.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.788
Yeah. Don't we all?

40:50.970 --> 40:52.580
Hey, what's wrong?

40:52.624 --> 40:53.886
Agent Cooper.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.979
Glen, what's going on?

41:00.022 --> 41:01.459
I came to check on you.

41:02.634 --> 41:04.331
Why is my mom upset?

41:04.374 --> 41:06.594
Because you...
You lied to me.

41:06.638 --> 41:10.859
Elizabeth, you made me
feel like she might
still be out there.

41:10.903 --> 41:13.949
That there might still be hope!

41:13.993 --> 41:16.386
You told your mother
that the blood
in the phone booth

41:16.430 --> 41:18.127
wasn't a match
for your sister's?

41:18.171 --> 41:21.304
Mom,
I'm so sorry.
-Don't.

41:21.348 --> 41:25.395
How could you? How dare you!

41:25.439 --> 41:28.529
I can't imagine
what you must be going through,
Mrs. Cooper.

41:28.573 --> 41:31.532
But I want you to know that
I will be personally
taking over this case.

41:31.576 --> 41:35.797
No. I'm working
this case, Glen.
This is my sister!

41:35.841 --> 41:38.844
I'll make sure that this
investigation is handled
thoroughly, by the book.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.282
I'll leave no stone unturned.
