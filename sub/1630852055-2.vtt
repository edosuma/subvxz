07:01.818 --> 07:04.793
I'll get onto the service provider,
see what it throws up.

07:04.818 --> 07:07.504
Also find out
who practices kendo around here.

Rueben hadn't come back.

07:31.387 --> 07:33.522
Not even when you woke up
this morning?

07:33.547 --> 07:34.652
Rueben has...

07:35.876 --> 07:40.082
...had... insomnia
since his operation.

07:40.107 --> 07:41.882
He didn't want
to keep disturbing me,

07:41.907 --> 07:43.801
so he moved into a spare room.

07:45.387 --> 07:47.462

08:08.626 --> 08:10.162
had made any enemies recently,

08:10.187 --> 08:12.412
perhaps upset someone,
had an argument with them?

08:12.437 --> 08:17.292
I nursed Rueben back to health
after his heart bypass.

08:17.317 --> 08:20.492
Day and night, I prayed for him.

08:20.517 --> 08:25.522

12:23.327 --> 12:26.012

12:27.716 --> 12:29.691
We're here about Rueben Tooms.

12:29.716 --> 12:32.332
We heard that you were planning
to meet with him last night.

12:32.357 --> 12:34.731
Sometime between the kendo class
and when he was murdered.

12:34.756 --> 12:36.302
I did meet him.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.691
But I definitely
wasn't the last person he saw.

12:39.716 --> 12:41.652
And you know this because...?

12:42.886 --> 12:45.142
Well, that would have been
his killer, obviously.

12:46.966 --> 12:49.731
And what did you and Rueben
talk about?

12:49.756 --> 12:51.502
Oh... He wanted
to put my mind at ease

12:51.527 --> 12:53.332
about Toby Wagner joining the club,

12:53.357 --> 12:57.552
which he did, and then
I came straight home afterwards.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.142
Tell me, what did Toby do

12:59.167 --> 13:01.422
to make himself so unpopular
in the first place?

13:02.677 --> 13:03.972
I run the local paper.

13:15.836 --> 13:19.691
"Toby Wagner arrested
in connection with brutal murder"?

13:19.716 --> 13:21.972
You didn't hold back
in naming and shaming him, then?

13:21.997 --> 13:24.992
That's Viola. Alberta Tooms' sister.

13:26.187 --> 13:28.892
Murdered in cold blood
for absolutely no reason.

13:28.917 --> 13:31.092
And all the evidence
pointed towards Toby.

13:31.117 --> 13:35.292
It says here the case was thrown
out of court and Toby walked free?

13:35.317 --> 13:37.332
Harry Marx screwed up in court.

13:37.357 --> 13:39.652
The defence destroyed
his credibility as a key witness,

13:39.677 --> 13:44.292
and the rest of the case
disintegrated, and I was... furious.

13:44.317 --> 13:46.582
And yet you publicly hounded
Toby regardless?

13:46.607 --> 13:49.972
I couldn't bear see him strolling
around the village. No-one could.

13:49.997 --> 13:53.582
It didn't take much
to whip them into a frenzy...

13:53.607 --> 13:55.941
until he had no choice but to leave.

13:57.317 --> 13:58.532
And now...

13:59.756 --> 14:01.092
...according to Rueben...

14:02.607 --> 14:04.252
...I've been wrong all this time.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.452
Ancl Rueben had
definite proof of this?

14:06.477 --> 14:09.422
He said another witness
had been found,

14:09.447 --> 14:12.292
putting Toby elsewhere
at the time of Viola's murder.

14:12.317 --> 14:15.422
I don't know how,
and I don't know when, but...

14:15.447 --> 14:17.652
he assured me
he was going to tell everyone.

14:20.886 --> 14:22.502
Hm. I know that woman.

14:22.527 --> 14:25.422
That's Toby's ex. Mimi Dagmar.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.422
Or Wagner, as she was then.

14:29.557 --> 14:32.292
Actually...
Miss Tremayne?

14:33.836 --> 14:36.222
It's probably nothing.

14:36.247 --> 14:39.092
But she's been pretty angry
at Rueben lately.

14:40.557 --> 14:43.142
To be honest, she looked like
she was gonna kill him yesterday.

14:45.447 --> 14:47.941
Send for the case file
on Toby Wagner.

14:47.966 --> 14:51.532
I'd like to know how he walked free
in spite of the evidence.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.611
Ancl, erm, dig into Georgie Tremayne.

14:54.636 --> 14:58.092
Let's see what sort of a history
she had with Rueben Tooms.

14:58.117 --> 15:00.292
What about Alberta Tooms, sir?

15:00.317 --> 15:02.652
Rueben did step in
to defend her sister's killer.

15:02.677 --> 15:04.502
She might not be
too happy about that.

15:04.527 --> 15:06.292
Alleged killer,
but good thinking, Winter.

15:06.317 --> 15:07.892
You know how I know
it's good thinking?

15:07.917 --> 15:09.372
Because I was thinking the same.

15:10.807 --> 15:12.092
SIGHS

15:21.477 --> 15:22.782
Mrs Dagmar?

15:22.807 --> 15:26.452
Oh, wait, don't tell me -
it's Mr Barnaby, isn't it?

15:26.477 --> 15:28.941
Oh! What a lovely surprise!

15:28.966 --> 15:31.972
Are you and Sally
still in that house I sold you?

15:31.997 --> 15:35.332
Indeed we are, and it's, erm, Sarah.

15:35.357 --> 15:38.142
Anyway, erm,
I'm here to ask you about...

15:38.167 --> 15:40.061
Still shackled together, then?

15:40.086 --> 15:41.691
HE CHUCKLES UNCOMFORTABLY,
SHE LAUGHS

15:41.716 --> 15:45.012
Erm, Mrs Dagmar, I'm here
on official police business.

15:45.037 --> 15:50.532
Oh! In that case, I'm... all ears,
all eyes and all the rest of me.

15:52.247 --> 15:56.222
Hm. Tell me about, erm,
Rueben Tooms.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.652
Only, a witness told us that
you looked like

15:58.677 --> 16:01.252
you wanted to kill him
during your kendo class.

16:01.277 --> 16:04.691
Well, isn't that the whole point?
To kill one's opponent?

16:04.716 --> 16:06.892
I mean, not literally, of course.

16:06.917 --> 16:10.941
Are you denying there was enmity
between you and Rueben?

16:10.966 --> 16:13.372
Cards on the table -
his wife, Alberta,

16:13.397 --> 16:17.611
has been a very good fried to me
through all my ups and downs, and...

16:17.636 --> 16:20.172
I had the overwhelming sense
that he was...

16:20.197 --> 16:24.012
playing away, so I was just
a teensy little bit angry with him,

16:24.037 --> 16:25.652
but only on behalf of Alberta.

16:27.397 --> 16:30.252
Could the other woman
be Georgie Tremayne?

16:30.277 --> 16:33.252
We know that she met with Rueben
last night.

16:33.277 --> 16:34.452
They did meet, then.

16:35.716 --> 16:39.892
She's so...
lost and vague these days.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.702
I mean, come on, have you met her?

16:41.727 --> 16:45.172
She's all... smocks and sandals.

16:45.197 --> 16:47.172
Hardly going to catch anyone's eye.

16:47.197 --> 16:50.292
Did you know that Toby Wagner,
your ex-husband,

16:50.317 --> 16:52.861
was coming back to the village?
SHE SIGHS

16:52.886 --> 16:54.702
He wouldn't be here if I had.

16:54.727 --> 16:57.892
You still believe that
he killed Viola Deepdale, then?

16:57.917 --> 17:01.652
SHE SIGHS
I married a wrong'un, Mr Barnaby.

17:02.966 --> 17:04.782
I just didn't realise it
until it was too late.

17:04.807 --> 17:06.892
Now, please do remember me
to, er, Sandra.

17:08.447 --> 17:12.292
Now, this is the beating heart
of The Stitcher Society.

17:12.317 --> 17:14.252
It's where the idea was born,
Jocasta.

17:14.277 --> 17:16.941
And you think there could be one
of these in every town and village?

17:16.966 --> 17:19.172
Easily. A surgeon
might mend people physically,

17:19.197 --> 17:20.691
but it's what happens afterwards,

17:20.716 --> 17:23.092
that's where the healing
really begins.

17:23.117 --> 17:25.382
It all sounds... well and good,

17:25.407 --> 17:29.252
but are there honestly
that many heart patients?

17:29.277 --> 17:32.691
Definitely, if Tamworth Springs
is anything to go by.

17:32.716 --> 17:35.292
Trust me.
Coronary disease is a gold mine.

17:35.317 --> 17:38.102
I mean, we've had a revolving door
of members for several years now.

17:38.127 --> 17:41.052
All I need are the funds
to get as many Stitcher Societies

17:41.077 --> 17:42.612
up and running as possible.

17:42.637 --> 17:46.052
Premises, private nurses, money
for confidence-building activities.

17:46.077 --> 17:48.571
People will pay a fortune for that.

17:48.596 --> 17:50.612
There's no lonelier person
in the world

17:50.637 --> 17:54.102
than a patient with fears
no-one else understands.

17:54.127 --> 17:57.492
Mm... Well, as I said,
I like it in principle,

17:57.517 --> 18:00.052
but I would need to see first-hand
how it works.

18:00.077 --> 18:02.932
Absolutely. Let's... Let's get you
down to our next class or outing.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.691
Meet a few members.
I can arrange that.

18:04.716 --> 18:08.212
Oh... Text me a date and time,
and I'll pop along.

18:08.237 --> 18:11.002
Thanks for the tour. It was lovely
to meet you, Mrs Tooms.

18:12.796 --> 18:14.002
HE SIGHS

18:15.357 --> 18:17.742
I'm... I'm sorry.
I know how hard that must have been.

18:18.796 --> 18:20.901
I see you've reinstated yourself.

18:22.077 --> 18:24.612
Mother, all you need to know is,
I'm gonna make a great job of this.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.382
Only after you apologise for Toby.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.571
I couldn't be more sorry.

18:29.596 --> 18:31.901
Really and truly,
but father insisted he was innocent,

18:31.926 --> 18:34.332
said we'd all find out soon enough,
and I...

18:34.357 --> 18:35.542
What?

18:37.207 --> 18:39.571
I suppose I thought
the more people in the club,

18:39.596 --> 18:41.332
the more impressed Jocasta would be.

18:41.357 --> 18:45.691
If you weren't my son,
you'd disgust me.

18:47.567 --> 18:51.252
I'll get rid of Toby. I will.
You can consider him gone.

18:51.277 --> 18:53.462
And Georgie?
What about her?

18:53.487 --> 18:55.821
If your father changed her mind
about Toby,

18:55.846 --> 18:57.972
we'll never hear the end of it.

18:57.997 --> 18:59.972
She could turn everyone else.

18:59.997 --> 19:01.612
Fair enough. She's gone, too.

19:02.796 --> 19:05.021
But if I do that,
where does that leave me and you?

19:06.157 --> 19:07.492
Are we gonna be all right?

19:08.997 --> 19:10.571
We'll be just fine.

19:11.676 --> 19:13.182
Like always.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.132
SHE SIGHS

19:24.407 --> 19:28.612
Can't blame them.
People are in shock over Rueben.

19:28.637 --> 19:30.771
Probably not up to a pub quiz.

19:30.796 --> 19:33.691
Get wise. We've been blacklisted.

19:33.716 --> 19:36.212
It was insanity,
bringing Toby back here.

19:37.957 --> 19:39.901
Dear me.

19:39.926 --> 19:41.852
Oh, chin up, Julia!

19:41.877 --> 19:44.901
I'm here to offer you
a little bowl of hopefulness.

19:44.926 --> 19:48.742
Only, I may have a buyer for your...
delightful pub.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.612
You are outrageous. Just get out!

19:51.637 --> 19:53.132
SHE LAUGHS

19:55.357 --> 19:57.852
Ooh, pub quiz!

19:57.877 --> 20:01.252
Question one, economics.

20:01.277 --> 20:04.132
A man owns a pub
and can make a small profit

20:04.157 --> 20:05.612
if he sells immediately.

20:05.637 --> 20:09.292
Now, does he, A, say no,
because his wife tells him to,

20:09.317 --> 20:12.492
B, stall and lose the buyer,

20:12.517 --> 20:15.932
or C, does he save himself from
a second stress-related heart attack

20:15.957 --> 20:18.132
after his business
goes into receivership?

20:18.157 --> 20:21.742
As soon as people accept
that Toby is innocent...

20:21.767 --> 20:22.821
SHE SIGHS

20:22.846 --> 20:24.612
...they'll be back here
drinking again.

20:24.637 --> 20:27.972
My brother is not
and never was a killer.

20:27.997 --> 20:30.182
You know the truth of all this,
Cooper?

20:30.207 --> 20:32.292
It's only going to get worse

Betty's class are having

and we've decided to support her.

21:02.077 --> 21:03.691
I don't remember agreeing to that.

21:03.716 --> 21:05.972
Well, that happened
when you said "I do"?

21:05.997 --> 21:07.132
Oh.

21:12.487 --> 21:14.972
Are you happy
that we moved to this house?

21:14.997 --> 21:16.691
Well, yes, of course.

It's a quaint village,

23:16.229 --> 23:19.264

Toby, just slow down.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.663
No, no, no, there's no time!
They could come here.

They might even hurt you.

But that mob,
thanks to Georgie's newspaper,

24:41.899 --> 24:43.764
they decided
I was guilty regardless.

24:45.688 --> 24:47.634
You didn't report the "mob"?

24:49.329 --> 24:51.994
Georgie made sure that I was hated
by the entire village.

24:52.019 --> 24:53.514
No-one would have backed me up.

24:55.068 --> 24:56.913
Yet you're back here now?

24:58.868 --> 25:01.994
Rueben came to visit me
after my heart attack.

25:02.019 --> 25:03.913
He said he had proof of my innocence

25:03.938 --> 25:06.154
and that he was gonna
make things right.

25:06.179 --> 25:09.514
I... I couldn't believe it,
but he was adamant.

25:09.539 --> 25:13.234
Said that... he hopes that I'd be
able to forgive him and the others,

25:13.259 --> 25:16.024
so... I pitched up, and...

25:16.049 --> 25:17.954
and nothing changed.

25:17.979 --> 25:19.913
He hadn't even told them
that I was coming.

25:29.068 --> 25:30.954
Can you account
for your brother's whereabouts

25:30.979 --> 25:33.713
on the night Rueben was killed?

25:33.738 --> 25:37.234
What are you talking about?
He... He wouldn't attack Rueben.

25:37.259 --> 25:39.954
Why would he?
All the same, Mrs Steinman.

25:41.068 --> 25:42.593
Well, he was here.

25:43.738 --> 25:46.484
All night?
Yes. I was with him.

25:49.509 --> 25:53.234
Well, rest assured, we'll, er...
look into the break-in.

26:01.019 --> 26:02.154

Make sure you stick to our story.
You were here all night.

27:38.249 --> 27:41.144
I'm sorry. For a moment,
I thought you said "zipper".

27:41.169 --> 27:43.324
SHE CHUCKLES
I did.

27:43.349 --> 27:46.863
It's how surgeons describe
the heart bypass scar.

27:46.888 --> 27:49.374
Looks like a zip.
What they do is...

27:49.399 --> 27:53.613
break open the sternum
and then slice all the way down

27:53.638 --> 27:55.733
to a few inches
above the belly button.

27:58.119 --> 28:00.014
If you're ever having
a Sunday roast,

28:00.039 --> 28:01.254
make sure you invite a surgeon.

28:03.279 --> 28:04.894
They do a cracking job
on your chicken.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.504
Who would know he had that scar?

28:10.529 --> 28:12.733
His surgeon, obviously. Nurse.

28:14.039 --> 28:16.574
Or a member of The Stitcher Society.

28:25.399 --> 28:28.374
I want everything you can find
on Rueben Tooms,

28:28.399 --> 28:33.094
including whatever evidence he had
that proved Toby Wagner's innocence.

28:33.119 --> 28:34.424
I'll start with his wife.

28:39.399 --> 28:42.014
How's your eyesight, Mr Marx?

28:42.039 --> 28:45.813
Why? Are you moonlighting

of doing that.

29:08.758 --> 29:12.784
How did you feel about Toby Wagner
joining The Stitcher Society?

29:12.809 --> 29:16.174
Honestly? Volcanic.

29:16.199 --> 29:19.324
And when you and your husband
returned home after the kendo class?

29:19.349 --> 29:21.654
I was still volcanic.
I'm not going to hide that.

29:21.679 --> 29:24.144
I was furious with him.

29:24.169 --> 29:26.613
But please be aware that,
when you're married to someone

29:26.638 --> 29:31.094
with a damaged heart, you tend
not to yell at them or upset them.

29:31.119 --> 29:34.683
You're scared stiff
it might bring on another attack.

29:34.708 --> 29:38.574
So whatever anger or rage
I was feeling, it never surfaced.

29:38.599 --> 29:40.324
I merely went to my room.

29:40.349 --> 29:44.574
Hm. Your husband told Georgie that
he had proof of Toby's innocence.

29:44.599 --> 29:46.784
Interestingly,
he didn't tell you that.

29:46.809 --> 29:49.094
We didn't talk
for the rest of the evening.

29:50.599 --> 29:52.324
One more thing, Mrs Tooms.

29:53.679 --> 29:55.813
Were you alone the night
your husband was murdered?

29:55.838 --> 29:57.534
Yes.

29:57.559 --> 30:00.704
Yes, I was,
but I didn't leave the house.

30:00.729 --> 30:04.094
And for what it's worth,
I loved my husband very much.

30:04.119 --> 30:07.613
He may have done
a very silly, stupid thing,

30:07.638 --> 30:10.863
but it was nothing
that 40 years of a very solid,

30:10.888 --> 30:13.683
very loving marriage wouldn't fix.

30:32.818 --> 30:33.874
Training alone?

30:38.818 --> 30:41.554
Mimi had to take a quick call
from one of her clients.

30:41.579 --> 30:44.944
I am really sorry
about your father, Gideon.

30:46.068 --> 30:47.843
Erm... thank you.

30:49.088 --> 30:51.683
But listen, your subs are overdue,
for this month and last.

30:51.708 --> 30:54.404
I apologise. It's just a cash flow
thing. It'll sort itself out.

30:54.429 --> 30:56.593
I'm sorry to do this, Georgie,
but you're out of the club.

30:58.009 --> 31:00.154
You can't do that.
I'd be lost without it.

31:00.179 --> 31:01.404
I hear you... I do, but it's...

31:01.429 --> 31:03.194
it's not really fair
on the others, is it?

31:03.219 --> 31:05.304
You are not throwing me out, Gideon.

31:06.379 --> 31:07.634
I think I just have.

31:09.329 --> 31:11.793
I am running things now, after all.

31:11.818 --> 31:14.194
Then perhaps
I'd better tell the police

31:14.219 --> 31:16.684
your father and I didn't
just talk about Toby when we met.

31:17.818 --> 31:20.154
Rueben was really angry.

31:20.179 --> 31:22.043
He said he'd sacked you,

31:22.068 --> 31:25.194
and the next thing I know,
he's dead.

31:30.868 --> 31:32.593
Anyone else hear him say that?

31:34.259 --> 31:35.793
SHE SIGHS

31:37.688 --> 31:39.663
Close the door on your way out.

31:49.018 --> 31:51.123
Right. That's it.

31:52.258 --> 31:54.433
All done.
So, how am I? Still breathing?

31:54.458 --> 31:55.943
Still here?
GEORGIE CHUCKLES

31:55.968 --> 31:58.153
Er, yes, you are, but...

31:58.178 --> 32:00.273
Don't give me a "but".
Anything but a "but".

32:02.607 --> 32:04.353
I got your echocardiogram results.

32:05.817 --> 32:08.303
I'm sorry, Georgie,
but they've found an anomaly.

32:08.328 --> 32:09.633
Oh, God...

32:09.658 --> 32:12.173
Your surgeon is recommending
a second operation.

32:12.198 --> 32:13.732
I can't face another op, Erika.

32:13.757 --> 32:16.273
But it's not gonna be anything
you haven't experienced before.

32:16.298 --> 32:18.123
And the club
will rally round to you.

32:19.658 --> 32:20.873
I doubt that.

32:22.938 --> 32:26.293
I can't pay the fees,
so Gideon kicked me out.

32:28.138 --> 32:29.263
What?

32:31.138 --> 32:33.572
He's supposed to be carrying on
Rueben's legacy.

32:33.597 --> 32:35.343
Even after Rueben fired him?

32:37.528 --> 32:38.773
I didn't know he had.

32:39.908 --> 32:42.083
Rueben told me the night he died.

32:42.108 --> 32:44.423
Apparently...
it didn't go down too well.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.223
You should start
looking after your own heart.

32:49.248 --> 32:51.393
Oh, mine's fine.

32:51.418 --> 32:53.293
I mean in regard... to Gideon.

32:55.008 --> 32:57.543
Stop. We're very happy.

32:57.568 --> 32:59.423
Thank you.

32:59.448 --> 33:01.902
OK. I'll see you later.

So, SOCO found this in the pages
of a book in Rueben's bedroom.

33:43.168 --> 33:45.393
It's, er... It's an agreement
with a letting agency.

33:45.418 --> 33:47.933
He was due to move into
a new flat next month.

33:47.958 --> 33:51.223
'Anyone else's name on the lease?'
'Just Rueben's.'

33:51.248 --> 33:52.983
'Who was handling
the letting agreement?'

33:53.008 --> 33:56.063
'That'd be Dagmar & Deepdale.'
'Mimi's agency.'

'Indeed it is, sir.'

It's Sarah.

34:24.368 --> 34:28.032
So, this is how you knew
about Rueben's affair.

34:29.318 --> 34:31.493
My bad. Should have said.

34:31.518 --> 34:34.263
Only, he swore me to secrecy.

34:34.288 --> 34:37.343
Even though Alberta
is one of your best friends?

34:37.368 --> 34:39.983
Don't you think I told him that?
Yet still you helped him.

34:40.008 --> 34:44.702
Well... what can I say?
He was... emotional.

34:44.727 --> 34:45.983
And...

34:47.568 --> 34:49.063
...I have a big heart.

34:51.888 --> 34:53.263
Please.

34:59.978 --> 35:01.413
Ooh!

35:01.438 --> 35:04.423
Sorry. I wondered
where that had got to.

35:09.677 --> 35:13.063
Do you know,
you are sitting precisely...

35:13.088 --> 35:15.223
five feet and eight inches from me?

35:17.498 --> 35:19.863
Make that...

35:19.888 --> 35:24.503
four feet... and nine inches.

35:28.168 --> 35:30.293
You mentioned that Rueben
was emotional.

35:31.648 --> 35:33.503
He was... very upset.

35:33.528 --> 35:37.753
He said that the murder of Viola
had changed Alberta irrevocably,

35:37.778 --> 35:40.702
she couldn't get over it
and it was dominating their lives.

35:40.727 --> 35:43.113
And, sadly...

35:43.138 --> 35:45.143
very sadly...

35:45.168 --> 35:48.393
40 years of happiness just...
slipped slowly away.

35:50.448 --> 35:52.572
Who was Rueben moving in with?

35:52.597 --> 35:55.323
Oh... He refused to tell me.

35:57.918 --> 35:59.403
Was it you, Mimi?

36:00.898 --> 36:02.873
Are you the other woman?

36:05.538 --> 36:06.993
Would you like me to be?

36:37.788 --> 36:39.993
Now, I feel a bit feel weird.
Hands in, out?

36:40.018 --> 36:41.943
No, out.

36:41.968 --> 36:44.912

36:44.937 --> 36:46.763

Well, can you help me or not?

Mimi's found a buyer,
and they're in a hurry.

37:23.937 --> 37:26.943
You're using Mimi's estate agency?

37:26.968 --> 37:28.943
I mean, could you make it any worse?

37:28.968 --> 37:32.273
Julia loathes her,
and Mimi was there that night,

37:32.298 --> 37:34.483
threatening to feed Toby
to the dogs.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.763
Yes, and that's why
we're doing it on the sly.

37:36.788 --> 37:40.912
And now Toby's back, things
are going to go to the wall, Harry.

37:42.218 --> 37:44.123
Well, get rid of Toby.

37:47.238 --> 37:50.253
Don't you think
I haven't thought of that already?

Well, as if you don't!

She was practically

38:32.538 --> 38:35.353
OK, so, first,
you ask if I like this house,

and then Mimi crops up.

38:38.538 --> 38:40.073
What's going on?

Well, she's part of this case

Georgie was here on her own.

Anything back
on Toby Wagner's trial?

42:41.259 --> 42:43.164
Nothing new yet, sir.

42:43.189 --> 42:46.284
I was thinking,
what if Toby was a killer then

42:46.309 --> 42:47.673
and is still a killer now,

42:47.698 --> 42:51.053
and he came back to settle a score
with the people that hounded him?

42:51.078 --> 42:55.234
Trouble is, Georgie and Rueben
were seemingly on his side.

42:55.259 --> 42:56.923
They wanted him back in the village.

42:56.948 --> 42:59.164
Well, it's something
that the victims have in common.

42:59.189 --> 43:02.644
Is that all they have in common?

43:02.669 --> 43:06.644
Rueben stood in the way of his son
Gideon's plans for expansion,

43:06.669 --> 43:09.484
but where does Georgie
fit into that?

43:09.509 --> 43:11.774
Well, we know that Rueben
had a secret lover,

43:11.799 --> 43:14.874
and Alberta told me
that he made a silly mistake,

43:14.899 --> 43:18.053
which I just assumed she meant
letting Toby back into the club,

43:18.078 --> 43:20.954
but maybe Mimi isn't the only one

43:20.979 --> 43:22.484
that thinks Rueben's
having an affair.

43:24.229 --> 43:26.414
This is deeply unfair of you,
Mr Barnaby,

43:26.439 --> 43:30.644
to march in here and to accuse
my husband of infidelity.

43:30.669 --> 43:33.084
Rueben had a rental agreement.

43:33.109 --> 43:34.644
Absolute nonsense!

43:34.669 --> 43:36.414
You claimed yours
was a loving marriage.

43:36.439 --> 43:37.803
That wasn't a claim!

43:37.828 --> 43:42.364
All the same... we believe
that Rueben had met someone else.

43:42.389 --> 43:45.444
Look, I admit,
we had a few bumps in the road,

43:45.469 --> 43:47.524
especially after Viola was murdered,

43:47.549 --> 43:50.484
but not enough to warrant
his running off with someone else.

43:50.509 --> 43:52.723
Was Georgie Tremayne
the other woman? Georgie?!

43:52.748 --> 43:54.234
Dear Lord.

43:54.259 --> 43:56.923
You already knew that Rueben
was going to meet her

43:56.948 --> 43:58.564
on the night he was killed.

44:01.149 --> 44:04.484
Georgie and Viola were lovers,
Detective.

44:04.509 --> 44:08.314
So there is very little chance
that she and my husband

44:08.339 --> 44:09.954
were having an affair.

44:12.439 --> 44:14.593
I'd like you both to leave, please.

44:22.669 --> 44:27.414
Ah... here she is. Erika Marx.
Medicine woman.

44:27.439 --> 44:30.004
Hey... how are you doing?
How do you think?

44:31.509 --> 44:33.164
Ask a stupid question...

44:34.309 --> 44:35.843
I liked Georgie.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.234
Do you wanna talk about it?

44:41.259 --> 44:42.774
I'm just... here to get drunk.

44:42.799 --> 44:45.314
Well, that's also my kind of talk.

44:52.259 --> 44:54.444
You still haven't let me
give you a proper health check.

44:54.469 --> 44:56.414
MACK CHUCKLES

44:56.439 --> 44:58.803
Ach... You know
what my answer's gonna be.

44:58.828 --> 45:02.314
And I don't want anyone else dying
because I didn't do my job properly.

45:06.979 --> 45:10.694
Aye. You look like
you need a friend.

45:13.868 --> 45:15.593
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS,
CAR DOOR CLOSES

45:15.618 --> 45:17.284
That's a bit quick, isn't it?

45:17.309 --> 45:19.444
I bet the heating's
not even been turned off yet.

45:19.469 --> 45:21.444
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

45:21.469 --> 45:24.524
Mrs Dagmar.

45:24.549 --> 45:26.364
Mr Barnaby.

45:26.389 --> 45:28.564
You're handling the sale
of Georgie's cottage?

45:28.589 --> 45:30.803
That's somewhat swift.
She only died last night.

45:30.828 --> 45:32.774
Are you thinking of making an offer?

45:32.799 --> 45:35.843
What would this go for?
Oh, let me see.

45:35.868 --> 45:38.004
Oozes charm and character.

45:39.589 --> 45:42.774
Deceptive frontage,
yet dynamic interior.

45:44.799 --> 45:46.874
Worth a small fortune, I'd say.

45:49.109 --> 45:51.723
Sounds like there's a windfall
coming your way.

45:51.748 --> 45:53.484
Tell me, Mr Barnaby...

45:53.509 --> 45:56.414
why is my ex-husband
still walking around?

45:56.439 --> 45:58.414
It's just two people have died
since he came back,

45:58.439 --> 46:01.234
and yet here you are,
asking me about house prices.

46:01.259 --> 46:02.923
If you'd like to do some good,

46:02.948 --> 46:05.564
perhaps a little police protection
wouldn't go amiss.

46:09.229 --> 46:11.084
CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS

46:11.109 --> 46:13.234
DOOR CLOSES

46:17.109 --> 46:19.414
That man's going to end up
running someone over.

46:19.439 --> 46:21.204
Want me to have a word, sir?

46:21.229 --> 46:22.954
Confiscate his licence
while you're at it.

46:22.979 --> 46:24.124
ENGINE STARTS

46:29.469 --> 46:30.564
Mr Marx!

46:48.669 --> 46:50.414
Have you got a minute, Mr Marx?

46:50.439 --> 46:54.314
WINTER STRAINS

46:54.339 --> 46:57.524
Where did you say you live?
Oh, just up the hill.

46:57.549 --> 46:59.673
Look, you could just give me
my keys back, you know.

47:00.979 --> 47:03.874
Oh, that would be
a dereliction of duty, Mr Marx.

47:03.899 --> 47:07.084
Dangerous driving.
You could do time for that.

47:07.109 --> 47:08.284
Sounds tempting.

47:09.509 --> 47:11.204
Probably have more friends.

47:13.948 --> 47:15.644
You don't fancy a pint, do you?

47:20.439 --> 47:21.524
In you come.

47:24.339 --> 47:26.694
What's this? Are you leaving?

47:26.719 --> 47:28.234
Cooper can't afford to keep me on.

47:28.259 --> 47:32.204
I thought I'd shoot a few
clay pigeons and then be on my way.

47:32.229 --> 47:33.314
Have a seat.

47:41.719 --> 47:43.414
Yeah, it's clean.
Oh.

47:43.439 --> 47:45.234
SHE CHUCKLES

47:45.259 --> 47:46.923
Slainte.

47:46.948 --> 47:48.234
Cheers.

47:49.979 --> 47:51.644
Well, you'd better strip off
now then.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.084
In the name of medicine.

47:56.109 --> 47:57.514
THEY CHUCKLE

47:57.539 --> 48:00.723
An MOT before you check out.
It's Stitcher Society rules.

48:00.748 --> 48:03.204
I've got to make sure you're
not falling apart at the seams.

48:03.229 --> 48:05.314
Literally.
I have a sewing machine for that.

48:12.439 --> 48:13.694
Can I trust you, Mack?

48:15.789 --> 48:17.923
Course. Why?

48:17.948 --> 48:19.414
What is it?

48:22.309 --> 48:24.444
Rueben and Georgie are dead...

48:25.589 --> 48:28.874
...and all Gideon can think about
is building an empire.

48:30.719 --> 48:34.564
I've seen him cry.
I've seen him look upset,

48:34.589 --> 48:35.593
but the truth is...

48:36.719 --> 48:38.723
...I don't believe any of it.

48:38.748 --> 48:40.923
It's all an act, Mack.

48:40.948 --> 48:43.644
SHE SIGHS
And it scares me.

48:46.719 --> 48:48.593
Wait...

48:48.618 --> 48:50.764
You think Gideon
killed both of them?

48:57.389 --> 48:58.803
GIDEON: Mother got inspired.

48:58.828 --> 49:03.284
My father used to take us up to
Scotland for the Glorious Twelfth.

49:03.309 --> 49:05.484
Admittedly,
this is slightly different,

49:05.509 --> 49:07.314
but it'll still
get the blood pumping.

49:07.339 --> 49:10.004
Next week,
we'll have them fire walking.

49:10.029 --> 49:12.204
Well, this is rather more ambitious
than I imagined.

49:12.229 --> 49:14.514
In a good way?
In a very good way.

49:14.539 --> 49:16.514
I want to have a go myself.
THEY LAUGH

49:16.539 --> 49:18.124
And you won't be alone in that.

49:18.149 --> 49:20.694
PHONE DINGS
Oh...

49:20.719 --> 49:23.764
Oh, sorry. I need to be somewhere.

49:24.979 --> 49:28.234
But, look,
I am going to push hard on this.

49:28.259 --> 49:31.923
Though I'd have to insist
on a makeover.

49:31.948 --> 49:33.593
"The Stitcher Society"

49:33.618 --> 49:36.644
sounds like it's about old ladies
embroidering hankies.

49:36.669 --> 49:41.484
So, how about...
Blood Pumpers Limited?

49:42.899 --> 49:45.164
Be... Because that's
what I'm feeling here.

49:45.189 --> 49:47.484
Well, have a think, OK?
Hm, get the blood pumping.

49:47.509 --> 49:49.843
GIDEON LAUGHS
See you in a bit.

49:52.539 --> 49:55.803
It's happening, Mother.
It's really happening.

49:55.828 --> 49:57.803
"Blood Pumpers"?

49:57.828 --> 50:00.564
Your father would have hated that.

50:14.149 --> 50:16.843
Another club event?

50:16.868 --> 50:18.923
Got to keep the tickers ticking.

50:18.948 --> 50:20.954
Even though two of your members
have died?

50:20.979 --> 50:23.364
It's not down to me,
Chief Inspector, it really isn't.

50:23.389 --> 50:25.723
I'd soon as cancel everything,
but my investor insisted on

50:25.748 --> 50:27.444
seeing the club in action.
Your investor?

50:27.469 --> 50:28.923
It was my father's dream.

50:28.948 --> 50:31.564
To reach out to
as many damaged hearts as possible.

50:31.589 --> 50:33.954
Start again.
Sorry?

50:33.979 --> 50:35.923
I know your father sacked you

50:35.948 --> 50:38.694
and that you now
stand to benefit from his death.

50:38.719 --> 50:39.954
Why did he sack you, Gideon?

50:42.789 --> 50:45.414
He found out I was trying to sell
the format of The Stitcher Society.

50:46.669 --> 50:49.923
I'd found an investor. She...
She'd shown a lot of interest.

50:49.948 --> 50:51.723
Ancl Georgie Tremayne?

50:51.748 --> 50:54.314
You threw her out of your club,
so what had she clone to upset you?

50:54.339 --> 50:56.053
I didn't kill her.

50:56.078 --> 50:58.314
If anything,
I was gonna reinstate her.

50:58.339 --> 51:00.564
I mean, think about it.
The more members there are,

51:00.589 --> 51:02.694
the more the club
looks like a viable proposition.

51:12.868 --> 51:15.764
You won't believe this, sir,
but Harry Marx just told me

51:15.789 --> 51:18.164
that Georgie went to him yesterday
and changed her will.

51:19.439 --> 51:22.414
He didn't think to come to us as
soon as he knew she'd been murdered?

51:22.439 --> 51:25.084
He's stoned 24-7. I'm surprised
he even remembered this.

51:25.109 --> 51:27.694
Well, who's the beneficiary?

51:27.719 --> 51:30.764
It's the newest member of the club.
One Toby Wagner.

51:44.028 --> 51:46.363
BELL TOLLS IN DISTANCE

51:50.428 --> 51:52.563
Mr Wagner?

51:52.588 --> 51:54.403
I don't know what to say.

51:54.428 --> 51:58.233
You weren't aware that Georgie
had made you her sole beneficiary?

51:58.258 --> 51:59.922
No, I swear.
He didn't know about the will.

51:59.947 --> 52:01.513
How... How could he?

52:01.538 --> 52:04.203
Harry is hardly going to call Toby.

52:05.468 --> 52:09.153
I know that you and Harry Marx
are good friends, Mr Steinem.

52:09.178 --> 52:11.483
<i>É</i>

52:11.508 --> 52:12.953
£

52:12.978 --> 52:16.403
Hm. Let's hope not.

52:21.388 --> 52:24.722
Jules... I swear
I never knew about this.

52:24.747 --> 52:27.643
He's not going anywhere.

52:27.668 --> 52:29.643

52:29.668 --> 52:32.483

52:34.867 --> 52:36.953
F

52:40.508 --> 52:45.052
One thing I don't understand is,
that mob had Toby Wagner,

52:45.077 --> 52:47.203
the most hated man in the village,
at its mercy,

52:47.228 --> 52:48.643
and yet they did nothing.

52:48.668 --> 52:50.233
Not everyone's a killer, sir.

52:50.258 --> 52:53.802
Well, all the same, they had dogs,
he'd hurt his leg, and yet still,

52:53.827 --> 52:56.802
he managed to escape
and get to his sister's pub.

52:56.827 --> 52:59.123
And I'd like to know
how he managed to do that.

53:03.588 --> 53:06.922
Tell me about that night
on the village green.

53:06.947 --> 53:10.353
Which one? I've had many nights out
on the green.

53:10.378 --> 53:12.753
This one involves dogs
and an angry mob.

53:12.778 --> 53:15.503
DOG BARKS ECHOING

53:15.528 --> 53:17.792
I didn't know
I could feel that murderous.

53:17.817 --> 53:19.553
TOBY: N0!
Turn them loose!

53:19.578 --> 53:22.582
Mimi, for the love of God!

53:22.607 --> 53:25.393
Just... Just... Just wait.

53:25.418 --> 53:28.433
This is crazy! I am innocent.

53:29.857 --> 53:32.353
OK, OK, please, just...
just... just wait.

53:32.378 --> 53:34.353
F

53:34.378 --> 53:35.943
Rueben!
HARRY: What are you doing?

53:35.968 --> 53:38.143
MIMI:
Go!

53:38.168 --> 53:40.433
He killed Viola!
Look at us, Alberta.

53:40.458 --> 53:44.143
We are not these people.
None of us are.

53:44.168 --> 53:46.943
And Viola wouldn't want this.
She'd be horrified.

53:52.578 --> 53:54.863
We weren't really
going to set the dogs on him.

53:54.888 --> 53:58.113
We just wanted to scare him
into confessing.

53:58.138 --> 54:01.473
But then Rueben stepped in
and prevented that from happening.

54:01.498 --> 54:04.473
That must have hurt, Mrs Tooms.
Horribly.

54:04.498 --> 54:06.073
I'd never felt so betrayed.

54:08.067 --> 54:13.633
But then, later, when Rueben had his
heart attack, I was there for him.

54:13.658 --> 54:18.273
I couldn't not be.
Every day, every minute.

54:18.298 --> 54:20.582
And you did all that
just for another woman to come along

54:20.607 --> 54:22.433
and take him from you?

54:22.458 --> 54:24.473
We were making things work.

54:24.498 --> 54:27.393
Caring for him
had brought has back together.

54:27.418 --> 54:30.223
Until he stopped believing
that Toby was guilty.

54:30.248 --> 54:33.943
Ancl worse, started
convincing people like Georgie.

54:33.968 --> 54:39.073
Toby Wagner bludgeoned my sister
to death in cold blood.

54:39.098 --> 54:42.353
He lured her to a house
he told her he wanted to buy.

54:42.378 --> 54:46.753
She turned up to show him around,
and he killed her.

54:46.778 --> 54:49.633
That is the only truth of this.

54:51.607 --> 54:53.113
BEEPING

55:00.418 --> 55:02.832
What the hell?
Oh, gosh!

55:02.857 --> 55:04.303
Er... so sorry.

55:04.328 --> 55:07.863
Erm, Cooper said to do this
when Julia wasn't here, but I...

55:07.888 --> 55:10.073
I can come back later.
Yeah.

55:10.098 --> 55:12.273
Maybe you should.
Yeah...

55:12.298 --> 55:15.863
Oh... by the way, you can't
tellJulia that I was here.

55:15.888 --> 55:18.353
HE SCOFFS
This village.

55:18.378 --> 55:19.633
Jam-packed with secrets.

55:19.658 --> 55:21.433
Not to mention a killer.

55:21.458 --> 55:24.223
I mean... I can't believe
that Toby hasn't been arrested yet.

55:25.498 --> 55:29.223
Maybe you've got it wrong, Mimi.
Could be someone else.

55:31.658 --> 55:32.832
Could be me.

55:34.067 --> 55:36.943
SHE SCOFFS
You're not funny, Mack.

55:38.248 --> 55:41.303
Why don't you jog on
back to your wee estate agency?

55:41.328 --> 55:43.863
Sell a few houses, this pub.

55:43.888 --> 55:46.912
Whatever keeps you
in pearls and perfume.

56:05.298 --> 56:06.792
Mimi?

56:07.968 --> 56:09.792
You forgot this.
Oh...

56:09.817 --> 56:11.912
CLATTERING

56:32.238 --> 56:34.523
Sir... finally got the report back
on Rueben's phone.

56:34.548 --> 56:37.732
It went to the wrong department.
Hm.

56:37.757 --> 56:39.163
What can you see, Winter?

56:40.908 --> 56:44.653
The village?
From this specific vantage point.

56:46.118 --> 56:47.963
Erm...
WINTER CLEARS HIS THROAT

56:47.988 --> 56:49.653
Harry's office...

56:51.038 --> 56:53.773
...and the estate agents,
Georgie's cottage...

56:54.908 --> 56:56.163
...and the pub.

56:57.877 --> 57:00.602
Yes. The pub.

57:00.627 --> 57:04.163
That's exactly what I can see.

57:04.188 --> 57:06.602
Good. Cos we need to go back there.

57:09.118 --> 57:11.243
Your mobile number
was called on this phone

57:11.268 --> 57:13.213
on the night Rueben Tooms died.

57:13.238 --> 57:16.013
The history of the call
was erased from the phone's log,

57:16.038 --> 57:17.163
but it still showed up

57:17.188 --> 57:19.653
in the service provider's
automated records.

57:19.678 --> 57:22.732
So...?
The phone belonged to Rueben.

57:24.268 --> 57:26.932
Is there anything
you'd like to tell us, Julia?

57:26.957 --> 57:30.493
Only that Rueben Tooms would
never have any reason to call me.

57:30.518 --> 57:34.293
Well, he was about to move into
a rented flat with someone.

57:34.318 --> 57:36.573
A woman.
His lover.

57:37.877 --> 57:40.883
SHE CHUCKLES
I loathed Rueben.

57:40.908 --> 57:43.163
You know what he did to my brother.

57:43.188 --> 57:45.163
Him and all those other savages.

57:45.188 --> 57:48.653
Except they didn't actually
do anything to Toby.

57:48.678 --> 57:51.243
Because Rueben stepped in.

57:53.188 --> 57:55.493
Anyway, I would never
have answered the phone.

57:55.518 --> 57:56.963
Not to a number I didn't know.

57:56.988 --> 58:00.373
Hm. That's odd, because the call
lasted 18-and-a-half minutes.

58:03.348 --> 58:04.852
Mrs Steinem?

58:05.908 --> 58:07.602
You're looking in the wrong place.

58:08.757 --> 58:11.602
Maybe someone else
picked up my phone and spoke to him.

58:11.627 --> 58:15.413
It certainly wasn't me. I swear.

58:36.908 --> 58:38.243
I heard everything.

58:39.518 --> 58:42.213
They're clutching at straws.
You and Rueben...

58:42.238 --> 58:45.573
Not now, Cooper.
..were running away together.

58:45.598 --> 58:48.093
What about me, Julia?

58:48.118 --> 58:51.493
Hm? You're gonna leave me here
to die, like this pub?

58:51.518 --> 58:53.413
Well, it's a good job
I'm selling it.

58:53.438 --> 58:55.133
You're what? You can't!
How dare you?!

58:55.158 --> 58:59.653
Wait. No, please, listen.
I'm doing this for us.

59:01.957 --> 59:05.413
I didn't nearly die on an operating
table just to have you walk away.

59:07.478 --> 59:11.052
I got through that not for me,
for you. For you, Julia.

59:12.318 --> 59:16.013
And I want us to move on. Up sticks.

59:16.038 --> 59:18.493
And get away from everything,
including Toby.

59:23.728 --> 59:26.413
Coop, we're done. It's finished.

59:27.798 --> 59:33.243
The only reason that I am still here
with you is because Rueben's dead.

59:52.798 --> 59:55.293
You all right?
HE SIGHS

59:55.318 --> 59:58.273
Fancy watching a matinee with me?
What?

1:00:01.348 --> 1:00:02.932
You've got a starring role.

1:00:04.318 --> 1:00:07.573
Ah... That doesn't look good,
does it? How...?

1:00:09.118 --> 1:00:11.963
What? I didn't kill Rueben.

1:00:11.988 --> 1:00:14.602
Talking of whom, you know,
he owes me a fair amount of moolah.

1:00:16.368 --> 1:00:17.963
I mean, obviously,
he can't stump up,

1:00:17.988 --> 1:00:20.133
but I thought, well,
you could do it on his behalf.

1:00:21.598 --> 1:00:23.573
Owes you? For what?

1:00:23.598 --> 1:00:26.453
Proving that your brother
is innocent.

1:00:26.478 --> 1:00:29.133
You've got the proof?
Eh! Money first.

1:00:29.158 --> 1:00:32.013
Oh, I need to know.
And, if you pay me extra,

1:00:32.038 --> 1:00:35.013
I can make
this little film disappear.

1:00:35.038 --> 1:00:36.852
SHE SCOFFS
You know we're broke.

1:00:36.877 --> 1:00:39.493
You won't be when Cooper sells up.

1:00:39.518 --> 1:00:41.163
How do you know about that?

1:00:41.188 --> 1:00:43.323
This is all you need
to worry about the now.

1:00:44.518 --> 1:00:45.852
What?

1:00:49.827 --> 1:00:52.052
Oh... That's outrageous.

1:00:52.077 --> 1:00:54.883
So's what's on this film.

1:00:56.268 --> 1:00:58.493
SHE SCOFFS

1:00:58.518 --> 1:01:00.013
Wha...?

1:01:06.077 --> 1:01:09.323
INDISTINCT CHATTER

1:01:20.318 --> 1:01:22.052
Rules are there for a reason, Harry.

1:01:23.238 --> 1:01:25.883
Leave your gun uncocked until you're
in a designated shooting area.

1:01:28.678 --> 1:01:31.852
I thought I told you
to get rid of Toby Wagner.

1:01:31.877 --> 1:01:34.802
I will, I promise.
CLEARS HIS THROAT

1:01:34.827 --> 1:01:39.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
today is all about targets.

1:01:39.188 --> 1:01:42.653
The things you think
have drifted out of reach.

1:01:42.678 --> 1:01:44.852
That you'll never be able
to grab for again.

1:01:44.877 --> 1:01:47.602
Well, none of that is true.

1:01:47.627 --> 1:01:50.523
You are all highly capable people.

1:01:50.548 --> 1:01:52.373
You'll see that I've put your names
on the guns

1:01:52.398 --> 1:01:56.602
solely because I what you to pick up
that weapon and become its master.

1:01:56.627 --> 1:01:58.802
Or mistress.
SHE CHUCKLES

1:01:58.827 --> 1:02:03.013
You need to take control of all the
things that scare or unsettle you,

1:02:03.038 --> 1:02:04.883
and you need to do it now.

1:02:04.908 --> 1:02:07.523
APPLAUSE

1:02:07.548 --> 1:02:11.163
Right. Let's get
this shooting party started.

1:02:11.188 --> 1:02:13.013
Yes! Come on, Coop.

1:02:13.038 --> 1:02:14.453
COOPER:

1:02:20.438 --> 1:02:22.653
Barnaby?
He's in the canteen.

1:02:22.678 --> 1:02:24.413
Something about
"murdering a sausage roll".

1:02:25.757 --> 1:02:28.133
We found several sets
of fingerprints in the lodge,

1:02:28.158 --> 1:02:30.343
none that shouldn't have been there.

1:02:30.368 --> 1:02:32.093
So?
Drum roll, please.

1:02:33.988 --> 1:02:38.163
I ran them anyway, and one set
showed up on the police database.

1:02:38.188 --> 1:02:40.373
The prints belong to Mack Mclnally.

1:02:40.398 --> 1:02:43.052
The Scotsman?
EMAIL ALERT

1:02:43.077 --> 1:02:45.703
Ugh... I knew it.

1:02:48.318 --> 1:02:51.453
That's the same paint that Mack
was using when I interviewed him.

1:02:51.478 --> 1:02:54.773
Mack threatened Toby?
He's a bag of tricks.

1:02:54.798 --> 1:02:57.802
Turns out he's also
a private investigator.

1:02:57.827 --> 1:02:59.573
Oh.

1:02:59.598 --> 1:03:03.817
Which begs the question as to why
he joined The Stitcher Society.

1:03:03.842 --> 1:03:06.750
Was it for health or business?

1:03:07.952 --> 1:03:10.304
Mack's got a room
at the Steinems' pub.

1:03:10.329 --> 1:03:12.583
Get a team round there,
see what you can dig up

1:03:12.608 --> 1:03:15.864
whilst I take in a spot of, er,
clay pigeon shooting.

1:03:15.889 --> 1:03:19.114
Sir?
Apparently, it's good for the heart.

1:03:20.219 --> 1:03:21.634
Cooper, you're up first.

1:03:23.019 --> 1:03:24.754
Me?
MACK LAUGHS

1:03:24.779 --> 1:03:28.144
Aye, you big Southern jessie.
Hey, less of the "Southern", you!

1:03:28.169 --> 1:03:32.634
Right, I might need to, er...
do some... deep breathing.

1:03:32.659 --> 1:03:34.144
Yes.

1:03:34.169 --> 1:03:36.304
COOPER EXHALES DEEPLY

1:03:36.329 --> 1:03:40.504
HE BREATHES DEEPLY

1:03:50.889 --> 1:03:53.554
Mmmmmmm
HE EXHALES DEEPLY

1:03:58.299 --> 1:04:00.634
Oh, for God's sake.

1:04:02.499 --> 1:04:06.194
And by the way,
you don't belong here.

1:04:11.449 --> 1:04:12.634
Mother?

1:04:13.808 --> 1:04:15.194
Pull!

1:04:16.419 --> 1:04:18.033
GUNSHOT,
APPLAUSE

1:04:18.058 --> 1:04:19.554
Good shot.

1:04:23.058 --> 1:04:25.144
SHELL CLATTERS
Take note.

1:04:26.699 --> 1:04:30.474
Er... great stuff, Mother.
Leading the way, as usual.

1:04:30.499 --> 1:04:32.304
Mack, why don't you see
if you can follow that?

1:04:32.329 --> 1:04:35.394
And, obviously,
stick to the safety guidelines.

1:04:39.449 --> 1:04:42.274
HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

1:04:42.299 --> 1:04:44.674
Remember, eyes on the target, Mack.

1:04:44.699 --> 1:04:46.114
F

1:04:49.608 --> 1:04:51.114
<i>A</i>

1:04:52.299 --> 1:04:54.474
GUNSHOT
Oh!

1:04:54.499 --> 1:04:56.394
APPLAUSE
Good.

1:04:57.449 --> 1:04:58.843
<i>A</i>

1:05:01.628 --> 1:05:03.053
GUNSHOT
Oh!

1:05:03.078 --> 1:05:07.214
SCREAMING

1:05:27.148 --> 1:05:28.563
Good for the heart, you see.

1:05:31.108 --> 1:05:33.433
I take it the shotgun
was tampered with?

1:05:33.458 --> 1:05:36.123
It's easier than you might imagine.

1:05:38.338 --> 1:05:42.083
Thin strips of cloth
used to jam the barrel.

1:05:42.108 --> 1:05:45.203
The shell had nowhere else to go
but backwards.

1:05:45.228 --> 1:05:47.792
All but guaranteed
to remove someone's face.

1:05:47.817 --> 1:05:50.563
I'm amazed no-one saw it
being tampered with.

1:05:50.588 --> 1:05:54.003
Humans, Barnaby.
If they can find a way, they will.

1:05:54.028 --> 1:05:57.873
And, of course, now,
I can answer your earlier question.

1:05:57.898 --> 1:06:00.643
He doesn't have a zipper scar,
does he?

1:06:00.668 --> 1:06:03.792
He was here on business.
Probably working undercover.

1:06:07.867 --> 1:06:09.313
Did I say, "Class dismissed"?

1:06:12.817 --> 1:06:15.873
These are bar towels. From a pub.

1:06:17.538 --> 1:06:23.042
Rueben is killed,
which means Gideon can go ahead

1:06:23.067 --> 1:06:26.643
and build
his Stitcher Society empire.

1:06:26.668 --> 1:06:29.643
Georgie's death
means Toby inherits a cottage,

1:06:29.668 --> 1:06:34.683
and... Mack was killed because...

1:06:34.708 --> 1:06:36.513
What?

1:06:36.538 --> 1:06:40.563
He found a witness
who proved Toby's innocence?

1:06:40.588 --> 1:06:42.363
But who is this witness, sir?

1:06:42.388 --> 1:06:45.922
I mean, so far, there's no evidence
of one anywhere. No name, nothing.

1:06:48.458 --> 1:06:50.153
No sign of forced entry.

1:06:50.178 --> 1:06:52.922
The door was unlocked
when we got there.

1:06:52.947 --> 1:06:57.233
No self-respecting PI is going to
go out and leave his door unlocked,

1:06:57.258 --> 1:07:01.283
especially not if he's undercover
and hiding who knows what.

1:07:01.308 --> 1:07:03.403
You think someone
had a spare set of keys?

1:07:04.747 --> 1:07:06.922
Let's ask the landlord, shall we?

1:07:48.538 --> 1:07:49.922
Mm!

1:07:52.388 --> 1:07:53.722
SHE SIGHS

1:07:55.588 --> 1:07:57.073
Mrs Steinem.

1:08:01.898 --> 1:08:03.513
If you don't mind?

1:08:04.788 --> 1:08:07.003
I-It's not...
It's not mine, I swear.

1:08:08.348 --> 1:08:09.842
I'll get Tech onto it.

1:08:11.508 --> 1:08:14.403
All roads keep leading back
to this very point.

1:08:14.428 --> 1:08:15.922
Don't they, Julia?

1:08:18.747 --> 1:08:21.003
No!

1:08:21.028 --> 1:08:22.873
Dinner time.
OK, OK, please, just...

1:08:22.898 --> 1:08:24.513
just... just wait.

1:08:24.538 --> 1:08:27.842
'The mob was about to scare
a confession out of Toby.

1:08:30.508 --> 1:08:32.683
'But then Rueben steps in.'

1:08:32.708 --> 1:08:35.643
<i>é</i>

1:08:35.668 --> 1:08:37.592
Toby managed to get away,

1:08:37.617 --> 1:08:40.592
but he wasn't your only visitor
that night, was he?

1:08:40.617 --> 1:08:43.563
KNOCKING ON DOOR

1:08:45.028 --> 1:08:47.233
<i>Q</i>

1:08:47.258 --> 1:08:49.792
'How long had your affair
with Rueben been going on?'

1:08:49.817 --> 1:08:51.203
<i>é</i>

1:08:52.388 --> 1:08:53.592
'For a while.'

1:08:53.617 --> 1:08:57.483
But it ended when my brother
was arrested for killing Viola.

1:08:58.978 --> 1:09:01.513
Despite the trial collapsing,

1:09:01.538 --> 1:09:05.073
Rueben just couldn't accept
that Toby was innocent.

1:09:05.098 --> 1:09:07.792
So... we fell apart.

1:09:07.817 --> 1:09:09.973
How dare you come here?
You're one of them.

1:09:11.198 --> 1:09:13.992
<i>É</i>

1:09:14.017 --> 1:09:17.062
You need to leave.

1:09:20.048 --> 1:09:23.503
<i>É</i>

1:09:27.637 --> 1:09:29.423
<i>é</i>

1:09:30.967 --> 1:09:32.942
I told him to leave.

1:09:34.408 --> 1:09:38.383
That all I wanted was for my brother
to be able to live peacefully

1:09:38.408 --> 1:09:42.453
in our village
without accusations and threats.

1:09:42.478 --> 1:09:45.742
So Rueben decided
to prove Toby's innocence?

1:09:45.767 --> 1:09:49.343
It took a few years...
a few false starts.

1:09:50.637 --> 1:09:53.703
Plus, he had to do it
all behind his wife's back.

1:09:53.728 --> 1:09:59.143
But, a few months ago, he said that
he'd found someone who could help.

1:09:59.168 --> 1:10:03.862
That they were confident that
they could find unequivocal proof.

1:10:05.198 --> 1:10:08.942
So Rueben and I started
making plans to be together.

1:10:13.887 --> 1:10:16.812
The night that Toby
escaped from the mob...

1:10:18.168 --> 1:10:20.583
...were you alone in the pub?

1:10:20.608 --> 1:10:22.893
Er... no.

1:10:22.918 --> 1:10:24.173
They were your dogs, Reuben...

1:10:24.198 --> 1:10:26.062
'Cooper was upstairs.

1:10:26.087 --> 1:10:28.862
'Though he'd sleep through
a hurricane.'

1:10:28.887 --> 1:10:31.612
He was absolutely petrified!

1:10:34.688 --> 1:10:37.143
Yeah, no, I can take it from here.
Thanks.

1:10:38.688 --> 1:10:42.663
So, this is linked
to a specific Wi-Fi configuration.

1:10:42.688 --> 1:10:45.612
It's... It's transmitting
to a laptop or a PC.

1:10:45.637 --> 1:10:48.893
Can you locate it?
Thanks to Tech, I can.

1:10:50.048 --> 1:10:52.663
PULSING SIGNAL

1:10:54.728 --> 1:10:56.583
Oh... That's...

1:11:01.248 --> 1:11:02.973
Wait here, Mrs Steinem.

1:11:10.168 --> 1:11:13.023
PULSING SIGNAL

1:11:23.837 --> 1:11:26.742
SIGNAL INTENSIFIES

1:11:30.328 --> 1:11:33.583
RAPIDLY PULSING SIGNAL

1:11:37.087 --> 1:11:38.703
We'll take that,
if you don't mind.

1:11:38.728 --> 1:11:40.173
I'd also like you to explain

1:11:40.198 --> 1:11:42.942
what you're doing
with a murdered man's laptop.

1:11:47.168 --> 1:11:50.093
It wasn't Mack who did that.

1:11:50.118 --> 1:11:52.453
It was you. Wasn't it, Mr Steinem?

1:11:56.278 --> 1:11:57.862
SIGHS

1:11:59.608 --> 1:12:01.062
Toby wouldn't take the hint,
would he?

1:12:02.528 --> 1:12:04.783
Him coming back,
it ruined everything.

1:12:04.808 --> 1:12:08.023
Me and Julia were happy.
Happier than we'd been in years.

1:12:08.048 --> 1:12:09.893
Until Rueben hired Mack.

1:12:12.278 --> 1:12:13.862
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:12:14.998 --> 1:12:17.143
Then why did you steal
Mack's computer?

1:12:17.168 --> 1:12:19.173
To be honest, I found him creepy.

1:12:19.198 --> 1:12:21.533
He was always sneaking about,
poking his nose in.

1:12:21.558 --> 1:12:23.173
I wanted to know what he was up to.

1:12:23.198 --> 1:12:25.062
Or you knew exactly
what he was up to

1:12:25.087 --> 1:12:27.253
and decided to erase everything
he'd found out.

1:12:27.278 --> 1:12:28.942
What, me? Pfft, no. No way.

1:12:30.278 --> 1:12:32.942
Where were you on the night
Rueben Tooms was murdered?

1:12:32.967 --> 1:12:34.663
Why?

1:12:34.688 --> 1:12:37.973
Because Rueben was having an affair
with your wife, Mr Steinem.

1:12:39.248 --> 1:12:40.423
Was.

1:12:41.757 --> 1:12:44.812
Was. You're also
Harry Marx's only friend.

1:12:44.837 --> 1:12:46.612
He told you about Georgie's will,
didn't he?

1:12:46.637 --> 1:12:47.783
Hang on a minute...

1:12:47.808 --> 1:12:50.303
Which gave you the idea
to frame Toby for Georgie's murder.

1:12:50.328 --> 1:12:53.583
Then you'd kill Mack to destroy
any evidence of Toby's innocence.

1:12:53.608 --> 1:12:55.783
Come on. That's a bit of a stretch,
isn't it?

1:12:55.808 --> 1:12:57.703
I've already had confirmation
that the bar towels

1:12:57.728 --> 1:13:00.223
used to block Mack's shotgun
came from your pub.

1:13:02.728 --> 1:13:04.533
And I did all this because...?

1:13:04.558 --> 1:13:08.503
Julia would have no-one
to turn to but you.

1:13:08.528 --> 1:13:10.703
You'd have your wife back,
Mr Steinem.

1:13:12.637 --> 1:13:15.942
HE SCOFFS
Do you know what?

1:13:15.967 --> 1:13:19.942
That is really good.
I honestly really like that.

1:13:19.967 --> 1:13:22.383
Yeah. It's got legs.

1:13:22.408 --> 1:13:24.583
Pff, makes perfect sense.

1:13:24.608 --> 1:13:28.423
Only, may I return to
the original question you asked me

1:13:28.448 --> 1:13:30.812
that you wouldn't actually
let me answer? Little bit rude.

1:13:32.168 --> 1:13:34.812
Where was I
the night Rueben was murdered?

1:13:39.118 --> 1:13:40.093
Well...

1:13:41.278 --> 1:13:43.423
...believe it or not...
KNOCK ON DOOR

1:13:43.448 --> 1:13:47.023

1:13:49.348 --> 1:13:50.842
KNOCK ON DOOR

1:13:53.258 --> 1:13:55.953
I-I-I'm so, so sorry,
but I needed to talk to someone.

1:13:55.978 --> 1:13:58.873
It's been doing my head in,
and I-I think...

1:13:58.898 --> 1:14:01.283
Rueben and Julia are back together.

1:14:01.308 --> 1:14:03.763
I'm not saying I know this for sure,
but you of all people

1:14:03.788 --> 1:14:06.123
know what it's like to be married
to someone that you adore,

1:14:06.148 --> 1:14:08.042
every breath, every move,
every nuance.

1:14:08.067 --> 1:14:12.283
I have ignored this once, and I am
not prepared to ignore this twice.

1:14:15.028 --> 1:14:16.592

1:14:18.508 --> 1:14:22.363
When you meet the single-most
amazing person ever,

1:14:22.388 --> 1:14:26.513
you would do anything,
ANYTHING to hang onto that person.

1:14:28.428 --> 1:14:31.683
So... all those things
that you have accused me of...

1:14:35.258 --> 1:14:37.513
...I probably could have done them.

1:14:37.538 --> 1:14:40.283
In fact, I...
I probably would have done them.

1:14:41.817 --> 1:14:46.153
But I promise you... I didn't.

1:14:51.708 --> 1:14:53.953
Even after she broke my heart.

1:15:00.258 --> 1:15:04.123
Well, assuming Cooper
isn't lying about Alberta...

1:15:04.148 --> 1:15:08.003
Then they both have alibis
for the night Rueben was killed.

1:15:08.028 --> 1:15:09.563
Mm.

WINTER SIGHS

1:15:16.817 --> 1:15:20.003
Ah! Look at that.
Mack filmed us, sir.

1:15:21.148 --> 1:15:22.763
Never knew
I had such screen presence.

1:15:25.228 --> 1:15:28.073
Is there anything else
Mack's cameras picked up?

1:15:28.098 --> 1:15:30.513
Oh, there's tons
of video files here, sir.

1:15:30.538 --> 1:15:32.643
OK, so, what have we got?

1:15:37.067 --> 1:15:40.363
Hm, I meant of interest.
Sorry.

1:15:42.788 --> 1:15:44.953
Oh, look, it's your admirer, sir.

1:15:44.978 --> 1:15:47.233
Thank you. What else?

1:15:54.788 --> 1:15:58.233
Well, that's Georgie meeting Rueben
on the night he was killed.

1:16:00.428 --> 1:16:02.592
That's Julia Steinem.

1:16:02.617 --> 1:16:04.683
And she told me she was in the pub

1:16:04.708 --> 1:16:07.283
on the night
Rueben Tooms was murdered.

1:16:23.067 --> 1:16:24.403
Hi. Yeah, it's me.

1:16:27.817 --> 1:16:29.233
I'm at Georgie's cottage.

1:16:30.668 --> 1:16:32.612
OK. I'll see you in a bit.

1:16:34.248 --> 1:16:35.863

1:16:44.218 --> 1:16:46.063
Argh!
Well?

1:16:47.937 --> 1:16:50.143
Why would I kill Rueben?

1:16:50.168 --> 1:16:52.273
I was about to start
a new life with him.

1:16:53.528 --> 1:16:57.912
The film on Mack's laptop places you
in the vicinity of Rueben's murder.

1:16:57.937 --> 1:17:00.393
A film that Mack
was trying to blackmail me with.

1:17:01.778 --> 1:17:05.393
Look, I promise you that all I did
that night was go out to tell Rueben

1:17:05.418 --> 1:17:07.553
that we needed to hold off
on leaving the village.

1:17:09.378 --> 1:17:13.063
Because the village wasn't as safe
for Toby as you hoped it would be.

1:17:15.138 --> 1:17:17.553
Viola's murder
has twisted this village

1:17:17.578 --> 1:17:20.393
into something
it wasn't meant to be.

1:17:20.418 --> 1:17:23.393
I hoped that Rueben and I
could change that.

1:17:23.418 --> 1:17:26.993
Bring peace. Even closure.

1:17:27.018 --> 1:17:28.993
But people don't forget.

1:17:29.018 --> 1:17:32.912
No, and they never forgave Harry
for losing the trial.

1:17:32.937 --> 1:17:34.582
Hence his unpopularity.

1:17:35.778 --> 1:17:39.423
That spaced-out fool is almost
as reviled as my brother is.

1:17:40.658 --> 1:17:44.032
Losing that court case
has haunted him ever since.

1:17:56.378 --> 1:17:59.673

that doesn't make him innocent.

Is that what triggered this?

I'm gonna kill him!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

There's no need for this,
not any more. Rueben!

1:22:32.318 --> 1:22:34.333
Georgie, just put the stick down.

1:22:34.358 --> 1:22:36.883
I know this is hard,
but we'll talk later, OK?

1:22:39.238 --> 1:22:41.333
Toby is not what you think he is.

1:22:43.358 --> 1:22:46.363
'Rueben's about-face
must have come as a huge shock.'

1:22:46.388 --> 1:22:49.693
It meant he knew
that Toby hadn't killed Viola.

1:22:51.388 --> 1:22:53.693

1:22:55.077 --> 1:22:59.852
So you had to kill Rueben

Trouble is... you were too late.

1:23:03.827 --> 1:23:06.413
Could the other woman
be Georgie Tremayne?

She was refusing a second operation.

1:24:04.604 --> 1:24:08.550
Rueben Tooms must have had
some very substantial evidence

1:24:08.575 --> 1:24:11.940
to be able to do that,
which leads us to Mack.

1:24:13.445 --> 1:24:14.940
He doesn't have a zipper scar,
does he?

1:24:16.054 --> 1:24:18.220
Is there anything else
Mack's cameras picked up?

1:24:20.495 --> 1:24:24.630
'Oh, it's more about the person
who didn't have one...

1:24:25.695 --> 1:24:27.670
'..and who else knew that.'

1:24:27.695 --> 1:24:31.060

1:24:31.085 --> 1:24:32.060

'..It had to mean that he was here
under false pretences.'

It wouldn't take much
to do some research on Mack,

1:24:43.215 --> 1:24:46.779
find out who he really was

about Viola's murder.

in return for telling him
what he wanted to hear.

1:25:46.624 --> 1:25:48.410
Mack had a history
