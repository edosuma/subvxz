00:02.086 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Justified...

00:03.462 --> 00:05.296
You have to do something
about your son Boyd.

00:05.381 --> 00:07.090
He has gone clear off the deep end.

00:07.299 --> 00:09.926
I got control over my boy.
Can you say the same about yours?

00:10.010 --> 00:13.012
"We know you ran Bo's
protection racket into the dirt."

00:13.097 --> 00:15.431
So it don't take a prophet
to see the future from here.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.393
Okay? You can either sit around,
waiting to catch a bullet...

00:18.477 --> 00:20.978
Or you can accept protection
from the Marshals Service.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.289
This is Ernesto and Pilar.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.375
Tomorrow they'll get into a truck,

00:42.459 --> 00:46.546
and, in two days, deliver
the shipment of ephedrine you requested.

00:46.630 --> 00:49.799
Now, you bring meth into our homes,
and I will destroy it.

00:50.050 --> 00:54.053
You destroy my shit,
it's the same thing as destroying yourself.

00:54.179 --> 00:55.638
Fire in the hole.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.201
Ava?

01:20.372 --> 01:21.497
Ava!

01:22.291 --> 01:23.750
Who is that?

01:24.668 --> 01:26.586
It's Boyd.

01:26.670 --> 01:29.046
You get the hell away from here.

01:29.131 --> 01:32.800
I apologize for the late hour.
I just want a word.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.559
What the hell you want?

01:41.643 --> 01:45.354
I am alone, and my hands are empty,
as you can see.

01:46.190 --> 01:48.065
Yeah, well, maybe you can use them
to keep this shot

01:48.150 --> 01:49.442
from ripping open your chest.

01:49.526 --> 01:52.361
I can only imagine that you'd want to
do that, Ava, given our history.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.490
Boyd, I got to warn you,
if I start counting down from 10,

01:55.574 --> 01:57.867
I may lose patience at five.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.660
I just came to say I'm sorry.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.581
I will leave now and disturb you no further.

02:05.250 --> 02:06.959
Sorry about what?

02:11.590 --> 02:14.383
So many things that I have done to you.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.261
Well, I want to hear this.

02:17.346 --> 02:20.348
Well, it's hard to know where to begin.

02:20.432 --> 02:23.976
I suppose I could start
with the last time I saw you.

02:24.061 --> 02:27.104
I held you hostage in your own home,

02:27.648 --> 02:30.107
and I instigated a shootout
in your dining room.

02:30.526 --> 02:32.902
That didn't end so bad,
as far as I was concerned.

02:32.986 --> 02:36.614
Well, before that, for years,
I lusted after you,

02:37.407 --> 02:39.534
and I was far from subtle.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.205
Well, that was wrong. Not only because
you were my brother's wife,

02:44.289 --> 02:49.752
but because it was unseemly, unwanted,
and it made you uncomfortable.

02:49.837 --> 02:55.258
If by "uncomfortable,"
you mean it made my skin crawl, then yes.

02:55.843 --> 03:00.304
But by far, my biggest regret
concerns my brother, Bowman.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.348
Why? You wish he was never born?

03:02.432 --> 03:07.645
No, no, no. I don't question the will of God
bringing any soul into this world.

03:07.729 --> 03:11.816
My regret is that I did nothing to stop

03:13.235 --> 03:16.362
or in any way curtail
his atrocious behavior.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.991
I know how he was, Ava,

03:20.576 --> 03:25.121
yet I took no action,
and for that I am deeply, deeply sorry.

03:27.207 --> 03:32.420
Now, if there is anything that I can do
to atone for that which I have done,

03:33.255 --> 03:35.131
I will gladly do it.

03:37.134 --> 03:39.552
How about what you do for me,

03:40.304 --> 03:43.431
is you leave here
and you never see me again.

03:45.601 --> 03:47.351
Let's start there.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.354
All right.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.953
Son of a bitch, Rufus!
What the hell's wrong with you?

04:50.123 --> 04:51.165
What time is it?

04:52.334 --> 04:53.876
About 2:45.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.092
- Get off my coat.
- What the hell is the matter with you?

05:01.176 --> 05:02.843
They should have been here by now.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.137
You call Bo.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.722
Where the hell you going?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.349
See if they didn't got lost.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.559
Ain't they got GPS?

05:11.478 --> 05:13.980
He can be a real old lady sometimes,
can't he?

05:14.064 --> 05:17.066
Yes, but he ain't got to be such a bitch.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.872
God Almighty, cousin. Where you been?

05:32.582 --> 05:34.500
I had matters to attend to.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.628
- Did you intercept the truck?
- We did, and we got the shipment.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.381
Damn, boy! We are taking over!

05:40.632 --> 05:41.841
What'd you do with the drivers?

05:41.925 --> 05:44.260
I sent them back to where they come from.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.890
Wait. What? You let them go?

05:49.975 --> 05:52.059
They should be halfway
to Tennessee by now.

05:52.144 --> 05:55.229
No. No, Boyd.
They were just supposed to disappear,

05:55.313 --> 05:57.106
along with the truck and the shipment.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.484
Where's the shipment?

06:00.569 --> 06:03.404
Johnny, it went up in a pillar of fire.

06:03.989 --> 06:07.992
Okay, enough of this bullshit, okay, Boyd?
It's time to start talking serious now.

06:08.618 --> 06:11.579
I could not allow that poison
back into Harlan.

06:12.664 --> 06:15.958
We had a plan, Boyd. Remember?

06:16.626 --> 06:19.170
Shipment disappears, Bo takes the fall,
and you and me, we step up.

06:19.254 --> 06:21.297
Is there a part of this plan
that you do not understand?

06:21.381 --> 06:23.507
Johnny, listen to me.

06:23.592 --> 06:29.430
Now, do you want to spend
the rest of eternity writhing in hellfire?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.807
Because that's how your plan ends, son.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.476
Well, you didn't tell me, cousin,

06:33.560 --> 06:35.895
that your plan was to go out there
and blow the shit up!

06:35.979 --> 06:39.690
And in that omission, I have sinned,
and I beg forgiveness from the Lord.

06:40.025 --> 06:44.862
You have always been crazy,
but this is batshit crazy.

06:45.989 --> 06:49.116
You have any idea
how ugly it's gonna get now?

06:49.534 --> 06:51.202
I am ready to reap the whirlwind.

06:51.453 --> 06:54.538
God! Well, I am not, okay?

06:55.582 --> 06:58.209
From here on out, you understand me,
you just stay clear of me,

06:58.293 --> 07:00.419
or I will kill you with these bare hands!

07:00.504 --> 07:01.962
As you wish.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.354
About 3:00 in the a.m.,
Harlan Sheriff's Office got a call

07:18.438 --> 07:20.689
about a truck fire out on a country road.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.400
And in the debris,
they found all these scorched metal rims

07:23.485 --> 07:25.319
for about a dozen shipping drums

07:25.403 --> 07:29.865
and all this residue that their forensics guy
identified as Ephedrine.

07:30.659 --> 07:32.201
A dozen barrels of Ephedrine?

07:32.285 --> 07:35.287
Somebody is going into
the meth business in a big way.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.082
Or the folks in Harlan
are really, really congested.

07:38.166 --> 07:42.461
From the debris pattern,
looks like the truck's payload was blown up.

07:42.879 --> 07:44.880
Like somebody hit it with a rocket launcher.

07:45.382 --> 07:47.466
- Boyd.
- Boyd's MO, anyway.

07:47.551 --> 07:48.717
Anyone killed?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.052
No sign of the driver,

07:50.137 --> 07:53.139
but the truck was reported stolen
in Florida a week ago.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.808
Well, Bo's got a connection
with the Miami cartel.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.601
Could be their Ephedrine.

07:57.686 --> 07:59.436
That'd make sense.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.148
But Boyd blowing up Bo's shipment doesn't.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.483
Unless he and his daddy
aren't working together.

08:04.776 --> 08:08.737
He did say we were on the same team now.
I just assumed he was full of shit.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.574
Maybe he's become some kind of vigilante.

08:12.659 --> 08:13.951
Maybe he's Batman.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.120
Maybe we should
just look the other way for a while,

08:16.204 --> 08:17.580
let him clean up Harlan.

08:19.332 --> 08:23.711
Your father was supposed to
meet Bo Crowder at Johnny's bar tonight,

08:24.504 --> 08:25.713
and in light of current events,

08:25.797 --> 08:29.091
maybe we should give some thought
to how to proceed.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.927
Give Arlo a call.
Have him come up here to Lexington.

08:35.682 --> 08:39.977
It ain't that hard. You follow him wherever
he goes and try not to let him see you.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.104
- You want us to call you?
- No, I'll call you.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.231
Go.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.403
Where the hell have you been?

08:49.487 --> 08:51.780
Out looking for the drivers.

08:52.866 --> 08:53.908
Who are they supposed to be?

08:53.992 --> 08:56.118
Them? They're the drivers!

08:56.953 --> 08:59.747
They're also very close associates
with our friend in Miami.

08:59.831 --> 09:01.415
They were just telling me a hell of a story.

09:01.499 --> 09:05.211
You want to tell the same story
to my nephew, please?

09:05.295 --> 09:08.005
There was a pickup on the side of the road.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.715
When we went to go move it,

09:09.799 --> 09:13.427
a man with a shoulder missile
came out and blew up our truck.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.471
And what did he say
just before he blew the truck?

09:15.555 --> 09:16.639
"Fire in the hole."

09:17.474 --> 09:19.808
- Oh, yeah.
- When we find him...

09:20.894 --> 09:22.728
...and shove them up his ass!

09:27.859 --> 09:28.984
How you think it's gonna go for you

09:29.069 --> 09:31.070
when our uncle finds out
you lost his shipment?

09:31.488 --> 09:34.490
- Not very well.
- Not well at all.

09:34.574 --> 09:38.911
Maybe we should try to put off him finding
out as long as possible. Lock them up.

09:39.996 --> 09:45.000
Are you shitting me? When Gio finds out,
he's gonna feed you to his alligator.

09:46.002 --> 09:47.044
Saddle up, Johnny.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.296
An alligator.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.591
I didn't have anything to do
with blowing up a truck.

09:52.676 --> 09:55.636
- No one said you did.
- Don't know anything about it, either.

09:55.720 --> 09:59.223
We just want to make sure that
you understand how this changes things.

09:59.349 --> 10:03.060
Our focus has been on Boyd,
getting him back in prison.

10:03.186 --> 10:06.689
To make up for you screwing up your case
by making time with Ava?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.023
Pretty much.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.819
The Bo Crowder operation now
is gonna have a lot more eyes on it,

10:11.903 --> 10:14.488
and that means you are now
gonna be the star CI

10:14.572 --> 10:18.534
for an investigation that includes the FBI
and the DEA.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.286
I'm not gonna be
working with you anymore?

10:20.370 --> 10:24.415
Yes, you are,
but you're gonna be working with them, too.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.042
Not just a little family affair anymore, Arlo.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.087
How much more do you figure
they'll pay me?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.010
I'm nothing if not predictable, huh?

10:36.094 --> 10:37.928
Like phases of the moon.

10:38.054 --> 10:41.640
The first step is gonna be to have you
sit down with AUSA Vasquez,

10:41.725 --> 10:44.393
and he is gonna be in a Grand Jury meeting
all day,

10:44.477 --> 10:47.271
so that's gonna have to happen later.

10:47.647 --> 10:52.192
You got anyplace that your father could
lay low until that meeting can happen?

10:52.277 --> 10:54.737
Someplace that's not my office?

11:02.329 --> 11:05.122
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

11:06.458 --> 11:08.667
- Come on! Move!
- Get out here, sunshine!

11:08.752 --> 11:10.210
Get out of here!

11:10.295 --> 11:11.712
There, boy.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.423
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Daddy.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.800
To what do we owe the pleasure?

11:16.885 --> 11:19.720
Well, looks like you've been a bad boy.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.182
You know what happens to bad boys?
They get spanked.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.518
Well, I told you what would happen
if you brought that poison here, Daddy.

11:26.603 --> 11:29.396
And I told you what would happen
if that happened.

11:30.648 --> 11:34.068
Who am I kidding? I can't hurt my own son.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.154
Johnny, hurt my son.

11:41.451 --> 11:43.118
Glad to oblige.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.204
And don't stop till I tell you.

11:45.288 --> 11:46.580
No, sir.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.418
Hey, Boyd.

11:51.503 --> 11:53.003
Hey, Johnny.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.506
This is gonna hurt.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.135
- Hey, come on.
- Shut up.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.089
Turning the other cheek on me, Boyd?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.334
Think he's had enough?

13:14.752 --> 13:17.129
I do not.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.173
You want me to kill him?

13:19.257 --> 13:22.009
That ain't the worst idea I heard today.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.180
We never was as close
as we should have been, Son,

13:26.264 --> 13:28.515
but how did it ever come to this?

13:29.142 --> 13:33.437
I don't know, Daddy.
I guess it's just one of those things.

13:33.688 --> 13:35.272
I guess it is.

13:36.107 --> 13:38.025
Where you hiding them guns?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.569
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.699
Listen up!

13:46.284 --> 13:49.161
Unless you want to stand there and
watch your little tin-pot messiah here

13:49.245 --> 13:50.454
get beat to death,

13:50.538 --> 13:53.207
you better start telling me
where you're hiding them damn weapons!

13:55.502 --> 13:56.835
Johnny.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.141
Hey.

14:13.561 --> 14:14.728
It's under the fire.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.605
Well, grab shovels and start digging.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.190
- Now!
- Come on, move it!

14:18.274 --> 14:20.275
- Let's go!
- Go!

14:29.702 --> 14:31.078
Not you.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.330
You leave.

14:34.040 --> 14:35.999
I will not leave.

14:36.084 --> 14:37.251
Oh, yeah, you will.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.920
Because after we dig up them guns,

14:40.004 --> 14:42.798
we're gonna rope your merry band
to these trees,

14:43.299 --> 14:45.384
and then I'm gonna
call your Marshal friend Raylan

14:45.468 --> 14:46.677
and tell him to come on out,

14:46.761 --> 14:51.473
and your flock is gonna be sent away
on numerous parole violations, I suspect.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.350
And I will go with them.

14:53.977 --> 14:57.396
Oh, you're not getting the point here.
You're done.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.816
You're no longer my son.
You're no longer their leader.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.026
You are being cast into exile.

15:03.111 --> 15:05.195
I will not abandon them.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.949
Okay.

15:12.787 --> 15:15.622
You can open your eyes.
I ain't gonna kill you.

15:16.082 --> 15:19.084
I'm gonna kill one of them, unless you leave.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.128
So, help me out here.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.380
Which one should it be?

15:51.034 --> 15:55.162
Did you think you could do what you did
and there'd be no consequences?

15:56.289 --> 15:59.875
All that transpires here is on you!

15:59.959 --> 16:03.462
You think about that while you're in exile,
church leader!

16:03.546 --> 16:06.214
All of this, it's on you.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.681
Make yourself comfortable.
Just not too comfortable.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.808
No danger of that.

16:17.101 --> 16:20.312
I'm supposed to be down in Harlan tonight
to meet with Bo.

16:20.396 --> 16:22.981
No, cancel that. Tell him you're feeling sick.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.691
Tell him you'll meet him tomorrow, okay?

16:24.776 --> 16:26.276
There a bar around here?

16:26.361 --> 16:29.821
Just stay put,
and I'll get you when the time comes.

17:21.124 --> 17:23.416
Well, how long has he been there?

17:23.501 --> 17:25.919
And you're sure he's by himself?

17:26.462 --> 17:30.173
All right. I'm on my way.
You call me if he moves.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.134
Release the hounds.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.139
Y'all come on up out of there, now.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.976
I'm sorry we didn't have the bridal suite
ready for you this week.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.562
Not as sorry as you're gonna be, dead man.

17:45.857 --> 17:49.693
Listen to me, Pancho.
Everybody's got to die sometime or another.

17:49.819 --> 17:50.819
I ain't got no alligators,

17:50.903 --> 17:53.739
but I do know where there's
some real deep mine shafts around here,

17:53.823 --> 17:57.492
so it might be a good idea
for us to keep this on a friendly basis.

17:57.577 --> 18:00.454
You got me there? I couldn't hear you.

18:00.538 --> 18:02.497
- Yes.
- Yes...

18:03.166 --> 18:04.291
Yes, sir.

18:04.375 --> 18:05.834
See? Was that so hard?

18:07.170 --> 18:11.548
You, call Gio. Tell him I took care
of that man that blew up his truck.

18:11.674 --> 18:14.426
- He's dead?
- He's out of business.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.512
But Gio's out $2 million.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.223
Gio's gonna get his $2 million.

18:20.349 --> 18:23.560
He's gonna get every penny that I owe him,
and a little something extra.

18:23.686 --> 18:25.604
What else?

18:25.688 --> 18:28.899
I prefer talking to Gio about that personally.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.237
Hey.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.073
Hey. Glad I ran into you.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.576
Well, I'm glad you're glad.

18:39.702 --> 18:44.372
No. I mean, yes. We should talk.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.041
- Raylan.
- Art.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.251
- Winona, how are you?
- I'm fine, Chief. How are you?

18:48.377 --> 18:49.586
- Never better.
- Good.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.797
Raylan, you want to take
a ride upstairs with me?

18:51.881 --> 18:54.508
- There a problem?
- Well, Vasquez got a 15-minute break.

18:54.592 --> 18:58.678
We need to brief him and also arrange
a sit-down with our CI, you know?

18:58.763 --> 19:00.096
Oh, well, I should go.

19:01.057 --> 19:03.892
Hang on, Winona. Can I catch up with you?

19:04.227 --> 19:06.561
I'll wait. You got till the elevator comes.

19:07.772 --> 19:10.816
- Anytime is good for me, to talk.
- And I mean just talk.

19:11.108 --> 19:14.402
Yeah. Well, I'm open.
Gary's at the athletic club.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.239
Living there.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.407
Maybe we could talk about that.

19:21.661 --> 19:22.953
Raylan?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.288
Right now!

19:27.583 --> 19:30.460
- Good to see you, Winona.
- You, too, Chief.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.589
- And that's when you got arrested?
- That's when I got arrested.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.883
All right, you know,
you were probably drunk,

19:36.968 --> 19:39.469
and everyone in the courtroom...

19:40.596 --> 19:43.098
- Who is it?
- Open the door, Arlo.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.142
Are you out of your mind?

19:46.269 --> 19:47.519
You have no idea.

19:47.603 --> 19:50.605
You're not supposed to know
I'm working with the Marshals.

19:50.690 --> 19:51.898
Are you wearing a wire?

19:51.983 --> 19:55.277
How's it look, you knowing I'm here?
What if Raylan answered the door?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.611
Raylan's not home, is he?

19:56.988 --> 19:58.989
You got a shadow on me?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.493
How do you know
there's not a mike in the ceiling?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.997
What are the chances
they're gonna bug their own guy's place?

20:07.123 --> 20:08.832
Fair enough.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.501
- Why are you here?
- Why are you here?

20:11.627 --> 20:15.380
Doesn't look to me like you're gonna be able
to make our meeting at the Pine Top.

20:15.464 --> 20:17.340
Things are different.

20:18.134 --> 20:21.303
They know about Boyd
blowing up your shipment.

20:22.305 --> 20:23.722
That he's not working for you.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.098
Yeah, they got that right.

20:25.182 --> 20:26.892
They're gonna give me new handlers.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.186
- Who?
- FBI. DEA.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.564
Which is good.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.275
Give me a chance to
give you even better information.

20:35.735 --> 20:39.362
Yeah, you see, the problem there is, I still
don't know whether or not I can trust you.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.323
You've known me 50 years.

20:41.407 --> 20:44.534
You think that ought to incline me
to trust you more or less?

20:45.411 --> 20:48.288
Help me see what it is from your side, Arlo.

20:48.372 --> 20:51.708
What's in it for you
backing me against the feds?

20:53.085 --> 20:54.794
You scare me, Bo.

20:56.631 --> 20:59.966
A hell of a lot more
than any damn federal agents.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.843
Right.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.723
You know, there is one thing
you could do for me

21:06.849 --> 21:09.976
that just might settle my mind
once and for all.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.937
What thing is that?

21:12.355 --> 21:13.897
Sit down, Arlo.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.823
It won't be an easy thing.

21:23.908 --> 21:25.742
I mean, how could it be?

21:25.868 --> 21:29.913
Make everything good between us,
put us back in business again.

21:33.876 --> 21:36.836
The other day,
we were talking about our boys,

21:36.921 --> 21:40.548
how much trouble they'd gotten us into,
which one was worse.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.800
Well, mine's worse.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.970
That shipment that Boyd blew up
was very valuable.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.889
It was sent to me by a friend in Miami.

21:49.058 --> 21:53.395
I have a lot to do to try and
repair my relationship with that man,

21:55.398 --> 21:57.565
and money alone won't cut it.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.442
To make matters worse,

21:59.568 --> 22:03.405
my Miami friend lost a captain
and a couple of button men

22:03.990 --> 22:06.741
to a certain deputy marshal.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.208
In order for me to get square with him,

22:15.292 --> 22:19.254
I'm gonna have to ask you to
help me give them Raylan.

22:47.450 --> 22:51.286
Dear Heavenly Father,
I'm not gonna pretend to understand.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.999
You told me what you wanted done,
and that's what we did.

22:58.878 --> 23:01.463
How could you let it end like this?

23:04.216 --> 23:05.967
All these men

23:07.511 --> 23:11.014
trusted me to lead them
on the path of righteousness

23:11.724 --> 23:13.641
for your name's sake.

23:15.394 --> 23:19.814
All these men came to you
because they believed in me.

23:25.154 --> 23:27.197
And now they're dead.

23:30.868 --> 23:32.827
I'm gonna need a sign.

23:35.039 --> 23:39.334
I'm gonna need to know
that their sacrifice meant something to you.

23:53.516 --> 23:57.185
Maybe I've just been talking to myself
this whole time.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.868
We set a meeting for you and the AUSA
first thing in the morning.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.873
Everything all right?

24:19.041 --> 24:24.045
I've been cooped up here all day
with nothing to do but watch TV and sleep.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.797
No one said it'd be easy, Arlo.

24:28.092 --> 24:31.302
How about we get you your own room
with your own TV? Sound good?

24:31.387 --> 24:33.054
Sounds good.

24:33.139 --> 24:37.642
Let me just put my shit down,
and I'll call the girl at the front desk.

24:40.771 --> 24:41.980
Want a drink?

24:43.232 --> 24:45.817
Of my own liquor? Sure. Why not?

24:55.661 --> 24:57.495
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

25:04.253 --> 25:06.796
You ever gonna get married again?

25:07.423 --> 25:09.090
What brought that on?

25:10.092 --> 25:12.260
I'm just making small talk.

25:15.681 --> 25:17.765
I don't know. Maybe.

25:18.309 --> 25:20.476
Never showed much aptitude for it.

25:21.937 --> 25:27.108
Guess if the girls chased me
like they chase you, I'd stay single, too.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.777
What are you talking about?

25:30.988 --> 25:33.281
I remember the girls always chased you,

25:33.782 --> 25:35.742
since you were 12.

25:35.826 --> 25:38.036
- Like hell.
- Ava Crowder.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.829
You're gonna tell me she didn't chase you?

25:39.955 --> 25:41.873
She didn't have to.

25:53.135 --> 25:55.637
Remember your mama's laugh?

25:55.721 --> 25:57.555
She had a good one.

25:58.474 --> 26:02.185
She always hoped you and me
would get closer.

26:03.812 --> 26:07.315
Maybe things would be different now
if we had.

26:07.816 --> 26:10.193
Well, I guess that ain't our way.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.819
You should get married again.

26:12.488 --> 26:13.821
Not living like this.

26:18.702 --> 26:19.827
What's going on, Arlo?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.746
You keep checking your watch.

26:21.830 --> 26:25.541
Just wondered how long
I've been a prisoner here.

26:25.668 --> 26:26.751
That all, huh?

26:26.835 --> 26:28.002
That's it.

26:32.675 --> 26:35.510
We never had much in common,
you and me,

26:36.553 --> 26:39.555
but that doesn't mean I don't have regrets.

26:44.728 --> 26:46.562
Put the gun down.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.574
When are they coming?

26:58.701 --> 27:00.702
They're waiting outside.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.871
How long you known?

27:05.541 --> 27:07.625
Well, Arlo, in truth,

27:08.752 --> 27:11.087
I think I've always known.

27:11.714 --> 27:14.007
This isn't something I wanted to do, Son.

27:14.091 --> 27:15.383
- No.
- But...

27:16.802 --> 27:17.969
Don't call me that.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.265
What's the plan?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.601
For me to shoot you in the leg.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.895
Bo wants to take you alive.

27:31.775 --> 27:32.984
Then what happens?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.798
- Where is he?
- Drop the guns, fellas.

28:18.655 --> 28:20.281
911. What is your emergency?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.117
This is Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.661
I'm gonna need an ambulance,

28:25.788 --> 28:26.996
and a coroner.

28:27.122 --> 28:28.623
Ava Crowder!

28:31.335 --> 28:32.710
Hey, Ava.

28:36.632 --> 28:37.965
What are you doing here, Johnny?

28:39.551 --> 28:42.303
It's Raylan. Got some bad news.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.138
What are you talking about?

28:45.140 --> 28:48.309
- Oh, no! Let go of me!
- Throw me that shotgun.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.019
A little help here!

28:50.145 --> 28:51.479
Watch your head.

28:55.150 --> 28:57.693
Johnny, get your ass up here.

28:57.820 --> 29:00.029
What are we gonna do with her?

29:00.239 --> 29:01.280
What the hell?

29:01.365 --> 29:03.950
This is for tipping Boyd off
about that shipment.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.827
No, hey, now, Uncle Bo, that wasn't me.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.334
Yeah, it was.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.045
You know, when they get here,
all they're gonna find is you dead

29:16.171 --> 29:17.755
and Ava gone.

29:18.715 --> 29:22.093
They'll figure that she killed
another Crowder come to harass her

29:22.177 --> 29:24.137
and then she lit out for the territories.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.848
That'll just be a theory, you know.

29:27.558 --> 29:30.393
They'll never be able to tell for sure.

29:31.854 --> 29:34.939
Ain't nobody ever gonna see little Ava again.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.066
So long, Johnny.

29:41.864 --> 29:43.906
- Don't...
- Shut up.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.242
- Easy.
- Does it hurt?

29:46.368 --> 29:48.077
What do you think?

29:49.121 --> 29:50.746
I think it hurts.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.081
You happy about that?

30:00.215 --> 30:02.633
What in God's name, Raylan?

30:02.718 --> 30:04.719
Your daddy sent them after me.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.262
Dear Lord.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.600
What are you doing here?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.731
I am lost, Raylan.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.816
What the hell does that mean?

30:18.901 --> 30:21.277
I sent my flock to slaughter.

30:23.739 --> 30:26.240
I'm not following you, Boyd.

30:28.243 --> 30:33.748
My daddy, he killed all my men, Raylan.

30:37.586 --> 30:39.462
He killed all of them.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.594
What happened to Arlo?

30:47.095 --> 30:48.679
He took a bullet.

30:48.764 --> 30:49.889
Ava?

30:49.973 --> 30:54.644
Marshal. I figured either one of my guys
would answer the call or you would.

30:55.479 --> 30:56.604
Seeing as you're still alive,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.524
I guess I can pretty well
figure out what happened with Arlo.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.108
You're on Ava's phone.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.986
Yeah. You get the picture.

31:04.488 --> 31:08.366
I'd let you say hi to her,
but she's in the trunk.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.117
So, what happens now?

31:10.202 --> 31:13.663
Why don't you get in your car
and start driving toward Bulletville?

31:13.789 --> 31:15.665
You ought to be there by sunrise.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.167
I'll call you with directions
when you get close.

31:18.961 --> 31:21.128
I know I don't need to tell you
to come alone.

31:21.213 --> 31:22.296
Yeah, I figured that.

31:22.381 --> 31:27.802
'Cause if I see a cop or a helicopter,
or even a glint from a sniper's scope,

31:28.136 --> 31:29.637
I will kill Ava.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.222
I'll be alone.

31:31.306 --> 31:34.016
That's all I ask. We'll make a straight trade.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.768
My life for hers?

31:35.852 --> 31:36.978
Something like that.

31:41.316 --> 31:43.025
- He has Ava?
- Yeah.

31:43.151 --> 31:44.193
Where does he want you to go?

31:44.695 --> 31:46.028
West towards Bulletville.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.490
He has a cabin out in Brogie Holler.

31:49.575 --> 31:50.658
Is that right?

31:51.660 --> 31:54.328
I know every inch of Brogie Holler.

32:04.548 --> 32:06.924
How many men he got with him?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.219
Well, you got Heckle and Jeckle,

32:10.679 --> 32:16.100
so that leaves Hestler, Rufus,
my cousin Johnny, and two other men.

32:16.727 --> 32:18.561
Any of them good with a gun?

32:18.687 --> 32:20.855
They're not as good as you.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.612
You were telling the truth, huh?

32:28.447 --> 32:30.197
This conversion?

32:31.867 --> 32:33.367
Was I?

32:33.910 --> 32:36.912
I don't know now, Raylan. I'm so confused.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.458
Yeah.

32:41.710 --> 32:43.753
Do you believe in God?

32:45.255 --> 32:46.547
I do.

32:47.591 --> 32:50.051
Tell me about your God, Raylan.

32:52.929 --> 32:56.807
Well, you know, white hair, long beard,
sits on a heavenly throne.

33:02.731 --> 33:05.733
I set all this into motion, didn't I?

33:05.817 --> 33:10.905
Actually, I think me shooting Tommy Bucks
might have had something to do with it.

33:25.462 --> 33:28.506
I'll approach them straight up front.
You make your way around back.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.091
If you can get Ava out, do it.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.176
Well, I'm gonna need a gun.

33:40.602 --> 33:44.438
Understand, Boyd, you take advantage of
this situation, I'll hunt you down like a dog.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.816
If I'm not dead.

33:47.776 --> 33:48.984
And you're not dead.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.529
You afraid you give me a gun,
I'd turn it on you?

34:13.802 --> 34:15.636
- Mr. Crowder.
- Raylan.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.933
Make sure and get that backup.

34:21.016 --> 34:24.186
This old boy can't be trusted with a cap gun.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.440
I hope you know how sorry I am
about this, Marshal.

34:27.524 --> 34:29.190
Yeah. You seem torn up.

34:29.317 --> 34:33.279
Well, I ain't saying I'm gonna throw myself
on top of your coffin or anything,

34:33.362 --> 34:35.697
but this "bring him in to me alive" shit
ain't quite my style.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.993
- I'd kill you quick if I could.
- Thoughtful of you.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.248
- So? Now what?
- Come on inside.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.625
We got something rigged up.
You're gonna love it.

34:46.710 --> 34:49.420
Hestler's been keeping Ava company.

35:06.897 --> 35:08.272
Well, let's go see.

35:15.530 --> 35:17.698
Raylan, I'm gonna need you to
step away from my father.

35:18.200 --> 35:21.076
Boyd, you don't want to do that.

35:21.369 --> 35:25.164
Not something I want to do, my friend.
It's something I have to do.

35:25.248 --> 35:27.082
Step back, please.

35:27.876 --> 35:30.044
You didn't come to save my ass,
did you, boy?

35:30.212 --> 35:32.087
No, Daddy, I did not.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.591
You gonna shoot me, Son? That it?

35:36.092 --> 35:37.176
Maybe.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.428
It don't really seem right.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.597
I had a chance to kill you, and I didn't do it.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.057
That's where you're wrong, Daddy.

35:43.558 --> 35:46.602
There's more than one way to kill a man.

35:46.770 --> 35:50.898
You can kill his physical body,
or you can kill his spirit within.

35:51.566 --> 35:55.069
You gonna pull the trigger,
or you gonna talk me to death?

36:14.089 --> 36:15.256
Who are these people?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.758
Raylan, who's out there?

36:18.134 --> 36:20.511
Miami gun thugs, I suspect.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.598
- What do they want?
- Me.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.851
You thinking about giving yourself up
to save us?

36:26.935 --> 36:29.770
Well, if I thought that'd work,
I might consider it,

36:29.938 --> 36:33.440
but I'm getting the impression
they intend to kill us all.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.109
How many you figure are out there?

36:36.111 --> 36:39.321
- More than one.
- I think I saw two in the trees.

36:40.115 --> 36:42.658
Looks like we got two more in a vehicle.

36:43.201 --> 36:45.035
- Ava.
- Raylan?

36:46.037 --> 36:48.038
Next time I ask you to get out of Harlan...

36:48.456 --> 36:50.124
I'll get the hell out of Harlan.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.793
You do seem to have a penchant
for getting abducted.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.795
Well, hey, it's a knack.

36:55.130 --> 36:56.338
Is my daddy moving?

36:59.634 --> 37:00.968
No.

37:10.729 --> 37:12.938
- Okay. Ava?
- Yeah?

37:13.023 --> 37:14.481
That window over your right shoulder.

37:15.317 --> 37:17.318
- Yeah?
- When I say,

37:18.069 --> 37:19.987
stick your gun out and take two shots.

37:20.363 --> 37:22.323
- At what?
- Don't matter.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.576
- All right.
- Now.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.336
One down.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.724
Will you hand me that rag?

37:53.897 --> 37:55.773
Put it right on here.

38:02.030 --> 38:03.238
Where's Johnny?

38:04.449 --> 38:08.577
Bo shot him at my house,
said that he betrayed him to you,

38:09.412 --> 38:13.457
said everyone would think
that I shot another Crowder and ran.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.418
Is he dead?

38:16.544 --> 38:18.796
I don't know. He was gut shot.

38:20.382 --> 38:21.882
Oh, dear Lord.

38:47.242 --> 38:48.909
I got your man out back!

38:49.494 --> 38:52.246
That leaves three of us, only two of you!

38:54.082 --> 38:57.626
You start walking, we'll hold our fire!

39:16.104 --> 39:17.479
You guys good? You all right?

39:17.605 --> 39:20.482
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. You good, Ava?
- Yeah.

39:25.613 --> 39:27.948
You didn't happen to
bring your rocket launcher, did you?

39:28.033 --> 39:29.700
I didn't think to pack one.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.827
All we want is Raylan Givens!

39:32.620 --> 39:34.288
I'm Raylan Givens!

39:34.622 --> 39:36.040
No, I'm Raylan Givens!

39:36.374 --> 39:37.458
Are you trying to be funny?

39:37.834 --> 39:39.168
A little.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.211
We get Givens, the other two can walk.

39:42.338 --> 39:44.381
I ain't going anywhere.
They killed my daddy.

39:44.466 --> 39:46.508
You came here to kill your daddy yourself.

39:46.634 --> 39:48.677
- Well, that's different.
- How?

39:48.803 --> 39:50.804
You got to kill the two men
who came after your daddy.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.556
You give me the same courtesy.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.141
Why don't we all just run?

39:54.225 --> 39:57.269
Well, someone's got to keep them here
for the other two to have a chance,

39:57.353 --> 39:59.688
and if we all stay here,
night comes, we're dead.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.275
Only one way this works.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.401
I'll stay, then.

40:04.486 --> 40:09.323
Boyd, I'm asking you, take Ava out of here.

40:14.579 --> 40:15.996
Come on.

40:37.852 --> 40:40.229
I don't suppose you'd flip on Gio?

40:41.856 --> 40:43.857
Come on out, and we'll discuss it.

40:44.192 --> 40:46.068
When I see empty hands, maybe.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.946
Yeah, and how do we know
you won't just shoot us?

40:49.030 --> 40:51.573
How about I come out unarmed

40:52.200 --> 40:55.619
and you come out unarmed and we talk?

40:57.372 --> 40:58.705
Okay.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.919
The second he clears,
you shoot him in the gut.

41:04.045 --> 41:06.296
Maybe we can get him to Gio before he dies.

41:06.381 --> 41:07.714
Got you.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.060
My hands are empty.

41:21.396 --> 41:22.646
Me, too.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.941
Where's your friend?

41:54.762 --> 41:56.180
Is he dead?

41:56.264 --> 41:58.140
- Yeah, I think so.
- Where's Ava?

41:58.266 --> 42:01.268
She's running through the woods.
Where you going?

42:01.352 --> 42:03.645
I'm going after the young lady
with the automatic weapon.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.272
I'll get her.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.866
What are you gonna do after you get her?

42:15.992 --> 42:20.787
I ain't quite figured that out yet.
You gonna shoot to stop me?

42:20.872 --> 42:22.664
Maybe.

42:22.790 --> 42:25.042
I'm pretty sure you're empty.

42:25.627 --> 42:27.002
You gonna bet your life on that?

42:28.213 --> 42:30.255
No, Raylan, I'm gonna bet my life on you

42:30.340 --> 42:32.799
being the only friend I have left
in this world.
