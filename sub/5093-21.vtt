00:07.960 --> 00:09.895
Come on, let's grab a bite.

00:09.897 --> 00:12.247
I can't. Got to work
in the morning.

00:12.249 --> 00:13.908
Party pooper.

00:13.909 --> 00:15.809
Be safe.

00:20.517 --> 00:22.416
Don't move! I'll shoot you!

00:22.418 --> 00:23.634
I am not playing
around here!

00:23.636 --> 00:25.770
Give me the cash! Now!

00:25.772 --> 00:27.088
Now!

00:27.090 --> 00:28.523
You two, back up!

00:29.858 --> 00:31.392
Let's go! Hurry up!

00:31.394 --> 00:32.759
Move, stupid bitch!

00:36.365 --> 00:38.032
<i>I-I know.</i>

00:38.034 --> 00:39.033
I know, Ma.

00:39.035 --> 00:40.785
I will.

00:40.787 --> 00:42.703
I promise, I will.

00:42.705 --> 00:44.539
I love you, too, Ma.

00:44.541 --> 00:46.107
I love you. Bye.

00:46.109 --> 00:47.959
I swear, not a word.

00:47.961 --> 00:50.211
Hey, I like hearing you
talking to your mother.

00:50.213 --> 00:52.547
She's probably the only woman
you don't lie to.

00:52.549 --> 00:53.781
Except about my tour.

00:53.783 --> 00:56.134
I tell her we work days,
'cause she always said

00:56.136 --> 00:57.668
nothing good happens
after midnight.

00:57.670 --> 00:59.253
12 George, report of

00:59.255 --> 01:01.506
shots fired, corner of
three-three and Broadway.

01:01.508 --> 01:03.558
12 George responding.

01:03.560 --> 01:05.927
Like she said, nothing good
happens after midnight.

Police! Don't move!

01:18.074 --> 01:19.323
Put the gun down!

01:22.028 --> 01:23.411
Put it down!

01:24.980 --> 01:27.165
Nobody's been hurt yet.
Be smart!

01:28.034 --> 01:29.167
Shut up!

01:29.169 --> 01:31.252
Shut up!

01:43.348 --> 01:45.466
What are we looking at here?

01:45.468 --> 01:46.868
Guy's covered
in blood.

01:46.870 --> 01:49.270
Says he has no idea where
the blood came from.

01:49.272 --> 01:50.438
You give him a toss?
Yeah.

01:50.440 --> 01:51.973
Any weapons on him?
No.

01:51.975 --> 01:54.909
Nothing, huh?
Okay. Thanks.

01:54.911 --> 01:56.944
We got it.

01:56.946 --> 01:58.045
Sir?

01:58.047 --> 01:59.297
You hurt, sir?

01:59.299 --> 02:00.781
Hmm?

02:00.783 --> 02:01.949
You hurt?

02:01.951 --> 02:03.718
I don't know.
I don't think so.

02:05.554 --> 02:07.232
Where'd the blood
on your shirt come from?

02:10.692 --> 02:12.759
Oh, my God.
What happened?

02:12.761 --> 02:14.028
You got any I.D. on you, sir?

02:14.030 --> 02:16.096
Hey.

02:16.098 --> 02:17.097
Where you live?

02:17.099 --> 02:19.533
In Bloomingvalley, sir.

02:19.535 --> 02:20.651
Blooming what?

02:20.653 --> 02:22.436
It's in Pennsylvania, sir.

02:22.438 --> 02:23.770
I just got here yesterday.

02:23.772 --> 02:25.105
And you don't know

02:25.107 --> 02:26.874
how your shirt
got full of blood?

02:26.876 --> 02:28.909
No, ma'am. I...

02:28.911 --> 02:30.878
I-I don't feel so well
right now.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.463
We'll get you
checked out at the E.R.

02:32.465 --> 02:34.665
Why don't you get
on your feet, okay?

02:35.884 --> 02:38.085
Come on.

02:38.087 --> 02:39.953
What's the last thing
you remember?

02:39.955 --> 02:42.956
Um... uh, being at my hotel.

02:42.958 --> 02:43.807
Which one?

02:43.809 --> 02:45.259
It's the, um...

02:45.261 --> 02:47.261
the Camelot Hotel.

02:47.263 --> 02:48.929
Oh, right there. Good.

02:48.931 --> 02:51.065
Let's take a little walk.

02:51.067 --> 02:53.234
Come on.

02:54.302 --> 02:56.854
Come on. I got him.
Come on.

02:56.856 --> 02:58.189
Nice, work, brother.

02:58.191 --> 02:59.773
It happened so fast.

03:01.194 --> 03:02.809
What, did you
have a few?

03:02.811 --> 03:05.112
Uh, I just came out
of a retirement party.

03:05.114 --> 03:06.313
Had a couple beers.

03:06.315 --> 03:09.483
All right, don't
say another word.

03:09.485 --> 03:11.452
You got to get a breath
mint or something.

03:11.454 --> 03:13.654
Here. Take
two of these.

03:21.429 --> 03:22.429
What was that about?

03:22.431 --> 03:23.564
What's that, boss?

03:23.566 --> 03:25.382
What was that about?

03:25.384 --> 03:26.967
Nothing.

03:26.969 --> 03:28.719
Nothing?

03:28.721 --> 03:31.021
Officer Grasso,
you the first one on the scene?

03:31.023 --> 03:32.356
Yes, he was, sir.

03:32.358 --> 03:34.191
Collared the gunman
with no shots fired.

03:34.193 --> 03:37.177
Are you his spokesperson,
Officer Reagan?

03:37.179 --> 03:41.949
No, um... I was walking by,
I heard the shot.

03:41.951 --> 03:44.034
What are the mints for?

03:45.353 --> 03:46.403
Have you been drinking, Officer?

03:46.405 --> 03:48.122
Uh, maybe I better

03:48.124 --> 03:50.023
call my PBA rep.

03:53.078 --> 03:54.695
This is
Lieutenant John Vance.

03:54.697 --> 03:56.213
Want to make notification

03:56.215 --> 03:57.798
and request IAB respond

03:57.800 --> 03:59.866
to Broadway

03:59.868 --> 04:02.803
and East three-three
to administer a Breathalyzer.

04:02.805 --> 04:05.089
Right.

04:05.091 --> 04:07.258
Boss,

04:07.260 --> 04:08.726
what are you doing?
He was off duty.

04:08.728 --> 04:09.977
He didn't even fire
his weapon.

04:09.979 --> 04:12.396
I'm following procedure.

04:12.398 --> 04:14.481
What are <i>you</i> doing,
Officer Reagan?

04:14.483 --> 04:15.766
Are you questioning me?

04:15.768 --> 04:19.353
'Cause I don't see
any captain bars on that collar.

04:19.355 --> 04:22.406
No, boss.

04:22.408 --> 04:24.441
I didn't think so.

04:32.834 --> 04:34.901
Gone, but not forgotten.

04:34.903 --> 04:37.454
About a half an half hour ago,
an off-duty police officer

04:37.456 --> 04:39.957
on his way home from a party
apprehended an armed robber.

04:39.959 --> 04:40.958
Fatalities?

04:40.960 --> 04:42.075
No.

04:42.077 --> 04:44.295
And the officer
didn't fire his gun.

04:44.297 --> 04:47.715
Good for him.

04:47.717 --> 04:49.683
There's something else.

04:49.685 --> 04:51.685
We have a situation.

04:51.687 --> 04:53.971
I'm on my way.

05:05.617 --> 05:07.117
How long you in town?

05:07.119 --> 05:08.602
Only here for a few nights.

05:08.604 --> 05:10.321
I'm here
for a vintage auto show.

05:10.323 --> 05:11.705
You in the car business?

05:11.707 --> 05:12.823
I restore classic cars.

05:12.825 --> 05:15.042
My dealer's here in the city.

05:18.112 --> 05:21.465
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

05:21.467 --> 05:22.449
Hey!

05:22.451 --> 05:23.634
Oh, my God.

05:23.636 --> 05:24.501
Come here.

05:24.503 --> 05:25.753
Oh, my God.
Come here.

05:25.755 --> 05:26.920
Give me your hands.

05:29.290 --> 05:30.641
Who is she?

05:30.643 --> 05:31.792
She's my girlfriend.

05:31.794 --> 05:34.061
I came to New York to
ask her to marry me.

05:34.063 --> 05:36.797
Well, I'm assuming
she said no.

05:36.799 --> 05:39.767
You want to tell us
what the hell happened here?

05:39.769 --> 05:41.685
Huh?!

05:41.687 --> 05:43.637
I... I don't know.

05:43.639 --> 05:46.523
I don't remember.
I don't know.

06:23.651 --> 06:27.069
Officer Grasso blew a point
zero eight on the Breathalyzer.

06:27.071 --> 06:28.070
He was intoxicated.

06:28.072 --> 06:29.405
I saw it.

06:29.407 --> 06:31.273
It's borderline.

06:31.275 --> 06:33.192
Sir, I know Officer Grasso.

That's all, Baker.

06:37.248 --> 06:39.448
Yes, sir.

06:40.567 --> 06:43.285
If he'd been driving a car,

06:43.287 --> 06:45.421
he would have been arrested
and charged with DWI.

06:45.423 --> 06:46.756
He wasn't driving a car.

06:46.758 --> 06:47.906
He was off duty

06:47.908 --> 06:50.543
and over the legal limit
when he pulled his gun.

06:50.545 --> 06:52.011
Did you have a drink
last night, Garrett?

06:52.013 --> 06:53.379
What do you think?

06:53.381 --> 06:54.764
Were you armed?

06:54.766 --> 06:56.265
Don't ask.

06:59.103 --> 07:01.687
They're already citing
the patrol guide, Frank.

07:01.689 --> 07:03.422
I didn't write the patrol guide.

07:03.424 --> 07:05.924
"All members must be fit

a press conference.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.037
He's leaving it up to you.

07:18.039 --> 07:19.321
Of course he is.

07:19.323 --> 07:20.623
And according
to Officer Grasso's

07:20.625 --> 07:23.042
PBA rep, he's gonna
fight any charges,

07:23.044 --> 07:24.960
which means
a department hearing.

07:24.962 --> 07:26.962
I suggest

07:26.964 --> 07:30.633
you let it go
through the proper channels.

07:32.587 --> 07:35.438
Let it go
through the proper channels.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.129
I don't do drugs.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.649
And I-I really don't understand
what's going on here.

07:46.651 --> 07:49.301
Well, that makes
three of us, Mr. Carter.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.970
Did you see Madeline last night?

07:51.972 --> 07:54.907
We were supposed
to meet at 10:00.

07:54.909 --> 07:56.192
Uh, she was running late.

07:56.194 --> 07:58.994
You said you were gonna
propose to her. Did you?

07:58.996 --> 08:00.362
I-I don't know.

08:01.532 --> 08:03.732
What happened
to the engagement ring?

08:03.734 --> 08:06.535
I don't remember.

08:06.537 --> 08:07.753
What do you remember?

08:07.755 --> 08:08.954
I remember waiting for her.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.540
I... I had a couple drinks.

08:11.542 --> 08:13.509
And then, uh,
this woman came up.

08:13.511 --> 08:16.328
She asked me
if she could sit with me.

08:16.330 --> 08:17.513
No, no.

08:17.515 --> 08:19.181
It's-it's not
what you're thinking.

08:19.183 --> 08:20.683
Oh, yeah, what
are we thinking?

08:20.685 --> 08:22.351
I told her right off the bat

08:22.353 --> 08:24.520
that I was waiting
for my girlfriend.

08:24.522 --> 08:26.889
She just didn't want
to be alone,

08:26.891 --> 08:28.390
she didn't want anybody
hitting on her.

08:28.392 --> 08:30.442
So, I was like,
"Yeah, sure." So...

08:30.444 --> 08:32.061
I don't...

08:32.063 --> 08:33.696
I don't remember
anything after that.

08:33.698 --> 08:35.648
What did she look like?

08:35.650 --> 08:38.701
Um, she was blonde, in her 20s.

08:38.703 --> 08:39.985
She have a name?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.370
Lacy.

08:41.371 --> 08:43.188
Did you and Lacy
do drugs together?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.456
Oh, my God,

08:44.458 --> 08:45.457
this is so crazy.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.693
I don't...

08:47.695 --> 08:51.463
I don't do drugs,
and I love Maddie.

08:52.716 --> 08:54.366
I-I don't remember

08:54.368 --> 08:56.585
what happened, please.

08:56.587 --> 08:58.470
Yeah, we get that part.

08:58.472 --> 09:00.756
Unfortunately for you,
we can't file charges

09:00.758 --> 09:03.041
until we complete
our investigation.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.311
Charges for what?

09:05.313 --> 09:06.879
Murder, for starters.

09:06.881 --> 09:08.681
Murder?
Yeah.

09:08.683 --> 09:11.267
With a shirt full of blood,
a dead body in your room

09:11.269 --> 09:13.235
and no memory of where
you were last night,

09:13.237 --> 09:14.820
it's not looking
so good for you.

09:17.158 --> 09:19.692
Keep us informed
of your whereabouts.

09:19.694 --> 09:21.694
I'll do whatever.

09:21.696 --> 09:23.779
Just, please...

09:25.916 --> 09:28.751
Just find out who did this.

09:28.753 --> 09:31.737
Don't leave
the city.

09:35.458 --> 09:36.959
You ready?

09:36.961 --> 09:38.510
No, I'm not.

09:38.512 --> 09:39.879
What's wrong?

09:39.881 --> 09:41.297
That was your principal.

09:41.299 --> 09:42.715
She wants to see me.

09:42.717 --> 09:43.933
What's that about?

09:43.935 --> 09:46.101
I don't know.
Why didn't you just ask her?

09:46.103 --> 09:49.087
I did. She said that she was
gonna tell me when I get there.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.973
Come on, Mom.
I'm a straight A student.

09:50.975 --> 09:52.641
What makes you think
it's something bad?

09:52.643 --> 09:54.526
I spent 12 years
at Catholic school.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.728
There is no way

09:55.730 --> 09:58.397
the principal is calling me
at 7:30 in the morning

09:58.399 --> 10:01.266
to request a meeting to tell me
you're an A student.

10:04.988 --> 10:06.605
He's got the greatest
defense ever:

10:06.607 --> 10:08.123
"I don't remember""

10:08.125 --> 10:10.943
He remembers a blonde named
Lacy asking to sit with him.

10:10.945 --> 10:12.795
He doesn't remember
killing his own girlfriend?

10:12.797 --> 10:14.246
Maybe because he didn't.

10:14.248 --> 10:15.881
You actually
believe this guy?

10:15.883 --> 10:17.716
I didn't say
he didn't kill her.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.169
I'm just saying, I believe he
doesn't remember what happened.

10:20.171 --> 10:22.421
But even if I he
drank too much

10:22.423 --> 10:24.473
and blacked out,
he's still responsible.

10:24.475 --> 10:28.143
Wow. You know, I've never seen
you this skeptical before, Baez.

10:28.145 --> 10:30.095
Boy meets girl,

10:30.097 --> 10:31.897
girl rejects boy,
boy kills girl.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.232
It's a textbook case.

10:33.234 --> 10:35.317
He proposed,
and she turned him down.

10:35.319 --> 10:37.603
So, why does boy give up
his shirt and agree to a swab?

10:37.605 --> 10:40.189
Because he's trying
to appear cooperative.

10:40.191 --> 10:41.740
A cooperative killer. Wow.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.326
You know, that's something
we don't see every day.

10:45.862 --> 10:48.697
How about we try to find
this Lacy girl, okay?

10:48.699 --> 10:50.816
If she even exists.

10:59.510 --> 11:01.126
Hey, what's up?

11:01.128 --> 11:02.494
Baker said you took off early.

11:02.496 --> 11:03.846
What's with the monkey suit?

11:03.848 --> 11:07.266
The mayor's awards
for arts and culture.

11:07.268 --> 11:08.934
What's with the small talk?

11:12.555 --> 11:14.390
Same situation,
I think I would've done

11:14.392 --> 11:15.841
exactly what he did, Dad.

11:15.843 --> 11:18.343
I probably would, too.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.345
You think he should be punished?

11:20.347 --> 11:24.483
As a cop, I think
he should get a medal.

11:26.136 --> 11:28.070
As commissioner...

11:28.072 --> 11:32.157
I-I have to testify
at the departmental hearing.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.659
Just tell the truth.

11:33.661 --> 11:36.211
Grasso didn't even
fire his weapon that night.

11:36.213 --> 11:38.697
There was no need
for that Breathalyzer test.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.800
It's not mandatory,
but a boss can ask for one.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.969
Yeah, well,
he's just a hard-ass.

11:45.755 --> 11:49.008
People have been known
to say the same thing about me.

11:49.010 --> 11:51.043
Vance only asked for that
Breathalyzer because of me.

11:51.045 --> 11:54.046
He saw the name
on my name plate...

11:54.048 --> 11:56.598
and I think that I drew
attention to Grasso.

11:56.600 --> 11:59.902
If you're a Reagan,
that goes with the job, too.

11:59.904 --> 12:01.820
You think he should
lose his job.

12:01.822 --> 12:06.275
I think he did the right thing,
no matter the consequences.

12:06.277 --> 12:09.945
That's what you need to do
when you testify.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.666
And that's what I need to do
as commissioner.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.240
<i>This is a copy</i>

12:21.242 --> 12:23.792
of an e-mail that Nicky
sent out yesterday morning,

12:23.794 --> 12:26.678
trying to rally students
to participate in a sit-in.

12:26.680 --> 12:30.182
Protesting locker searches
without student's consent?

12:30.184 --> 12:32.084
Which I'm sure you're aware of,
as an attorney,

12:32.086 --> 12:33.635
is perfectly legal.

12:33.637 --> 12:37.272
Right, but the issue here
is not whether it's legal,

12:37.274 --> 12:40.976
Ms. Pender, but whether
it's necessary to do so.

12:40.978 --> 12:43.529
Last week, we confiscated
a pack of cigarettes

12:43.531 --> 12:44.763
from a senior's locker.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.117
He's been suspended.

12:48.119 --> 12:50.869
Seems a bit harsh.

12:50.871 --> 12:53.072
I just think we need
to keep in mind

12:53.074 --> 12:54.406
who we're talking about here.

12:54.408 --> 12:56.775
I mean, Nicky is
an exceptional student.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.327
She's active
in the student council.

12:58.329 --> 13:00.829
She's never had a disciplinary
action brought against...

13:00.831 --> 13:02.631
Which is exactly
why I called you.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.833
Hoping that we
could find a way

13:04.835 --> 13:07.002
to preserve
her good record.

13:07.004 --> 13:09.121
'Kay. How do we do that?

13:09.123 --> 13:11.507
Nicky calls off
the sit-in.

13:11.509 --> 13:14.927
And... she apologizes.

13:14.929 --> 13:17.479
And if that doesn't happen?

13:17.481 --> 13:20.265
I would have no choice
but to suspend her.

13:25.989 --> 13:27.139
Scotch and soda.

13:27.141 --> 13:28.690
He was here last night.

13:28.692 --> 13:30.742
What could you
tell me about him?

13:30.744 --> 13:33.328
Guy was
pretty wasted to me.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.664
Was there a woman
hanging around with him at all?

13:35.666 --> 13:37.699
Blonde hottie.

13:37.701 --> 13:39.034
This blonde hottie have a name?

13:39.036 --> 13:41.120
Chardonnay.

13:41.122 --> 13:43.122
Chardonnay?
But other than what she was drinking,

13:43.124 --> 13:44.656
I don't know what to tell you.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.292
Right. Was the woman
coming on to him at all?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.460
I'd-I'd call it mutual.

13:48.462 --> 13:50.429
You know, looked like
they were hitting it off.

13:50.431 --> 13:51.463
They left together.

13:51.465 --> 13:52.764
What time?

13:52.766 --> 13:55.100
Just after 11:00.

13:55.102 --> 13:56.351
All right.

13:56.353 --> 13:57.836
I'm gonna need the, uh, footage

13:57.838 --> 14:00.105
from that security camera
up there.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.611
There's Carter
going to the bathroom.

14:07.346 --> 14:09.314
All right,
looks like she's getting

14:09.316 --> 14:11.233
something out of her purse.

14:11.235 --> 14:13.368
Come on.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.626
She could be

14:20.628 --> 14:21.743
slipping something in his drink.

14:21.745 --> 14:23.629
Yeah, but you can't
tell from there.

14:23.631 --> 14:25.464
How about the other
hotel security video?

14:25.466 --> 14:28.033
They got any footage of him
going back up to the room?

14:28.035 --> 14:29.534
Only Madeline going up.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.336
I got Carter coming down
around midnight,

14:31.338 --> 14:32.971
but his jacket's closed,
so you can't

14:32.973 --> 14:33.922
see his shirt.

14:33.924 --> 14:35.057
But he's alone.

14:35.059 --> 14:37.209
Great. How about
the service elevator?

14:37.211 --> 14:38.594
We can't check that.

14:38.596 --> 14:40.045
There's no cameras in it.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.515
So, in other words,
we got squat.

14:43.517 --> 14:47.603
Maybe he went upstairs with
the hottie to have sex,

14:47.605 --> 14:50.772
and Madeline arrives, but
he's not in the hotel bar,

14:50.774 --> 14:53.325
so she goes up to his
room, catches them,

14:53.327 --> 14:55.494
a fight ensues, he kills her.

14:55.496 --> 14:56.728
So, the hottie
just stands there

14:56.730 --> 14:58.363
while he kills a girl
and doesn't call 911?

14:58.365 --> 14:59.748
Because she's a pros.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.251
Still could've called 911.

15:04.204 --> 15:05.621
Serology report is back.

15:05.623 --> 15:09.424
The blood on his shirt
is a match to his girlfriend.

15:09.426 --> 15:10.375
What about drugs?

15:10.377 --> 15:13.262
He had scopolamine
in his system.

15:13.264 --> 15:14.680
The zombie drug.

15:14.682 --> 15:16.798
Zombie drug? What are
you talking about?

15:16.800 --> 15:19.518
Yeah, we came across this
when I was in vice.

15:19.520 --> 15:21.720
It comes from Venezuela.

15:21.722 --> 15:23.305
The drug makes you

15:23.307 --> 15:25.423
lose your free will,
do crazy stuff,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.359
and at the same time,
it wipes your memory.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.777
Kind of like roofies?

15:28.779 --> 15:30.812
Yeah, only worse.

15:30.814 --> 15:33.431
There's cases
down in South America

15:33.433 --> 15:35.734
where people wake up
beaten to a pulp,

15:35.736 --> 15:38.570
with no valuables, and
the victims remember nothing.

15:38.572 --> 15:40.289
So, he could've
killed his girlfriend

15:40.291 --> 15:41.773
and not even know it?

15:41.775 --> 15:43.942
Yeah.

15:43.944 --> 15:46.111
And that's where its street name
comes from.

15:46.113 --> 15:47.412
Which is?

15:47.414 --> 15:49.881
Devil's breath.

15:49.883 --> 15:52.084
Devil's breath.

15:59.008 --> 16:01.843
I just met a very nice
young woman outside

16:01.845 --> 16:04.896
whose last name is Grasso.

16:04.898 --> 16:06.415
Could it be a coincidence?

16:06.417 --> 16:07.849
Do you think it's wise

16:07.851 --> 16:10.235
to meet with
Officer Grasso's wife?

16:10.237 --> 16:13.405
I don't always do
what's wise, Garrett.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.656
I have 45

16:14.658 --> 16:17.993
unanswered calls and e-mails
asking your position.

16:17.995 --> 16:18.977
Ignore them.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.645
You know I
can't do that.

16:21.698 --> 16:24.783
So, I guess it's
"No comment at this time"?

16:29.489 --> 16:30.789
I'll see her now, Baker.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.298
Is there some reason
you do this?

16:40.933 --> 16:42.634
Seeing her will just
make it harder.

16:44.554 --> 16:46.772
It's supposed to be hard.

16:48.858 --> 16:50.675
Sir, Mrs. Grasso.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.860
Thanks.
Yeah.

16:51.862 --> 16:53.478
Hello.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.614
Please, sit down.

16:55.616 --> 16:57.866
Thank you for seeing me.

16:57.868 --> 16:59.484
Sure.

17:01.738 --> 17:04.071
Peter doesn't know I'm here.

17:05.907 --> 17:09.294
He's been on the job
for seven years now.

17:09.296 --> 17:11.380
He's a good cop.

17:11.382 --> 17:13.298
A good father.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.417
I know that, Mrs. Grasso.

17:17.887 --> 17:20.372
My husband put the welfare
of other people

17:20.374 --> 17:22.257
above his own, Commissioner.

17:22.259 --> 17:24.876
He saved those people's lives.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.146
And instead of getting
a medal for being a hero,

17:28.147 --> 17:30.599
he's being put on trial.

17:30.601 --> 17:34.102
I know how these
departmental hearings work.

17:34.104 --> 17:36.488
The cops never win.

17:38.392 --> 17:40.826
Judge Keller is fair.

17:40.828 --> 17:43.228
You think she's not going to
pay attention to the papers

17:43.230 --> 17:46.231
that are calling
my husband a drunk?

17:46.233 --> 17:49.234
Saying that cops
shouldn't be above the law?

17:53.005 --> 17:56.625
Commissioner, I notice that
in all of these news stories,

17:56.627 --> 17:59.928
there's not
one comment from you.

18:01.964 --> 18:04.966
And I'd really like to know why.

18:21.392 --> 18:22.475
When we got there,
Officer Grasso

18:22.477 --> 18:23.976
had the scene under control.

18:24.192 --> 18:26.275
He had subdued Mr. Nathan
without incident,

18:26.277 --> 18:28.211
and the victims
were no longer in danger.

18:28.213 --> 18:29.412
No longer in danger

18:29.414 --> 18:32.448
from Mr. Nathan
or from Officer Grasso?

18:32.450 --> 18:33.700
Objection.

18:33.702 --> 18:34.834
Withdrawn.

18:34.836 --> 18:36.519
You smelled alcohol

18:36.521 --> 18:39.255
on Officer Grasso's
breath, correct?

18:41.625 --> 18:44.243
Officer Grasso was off duty, and
when we arrived at the scene...

18:44.245 --> 18:45.261
I'm sorry.

18:45.263 --> 18:46.462
We're not here
for your commentary.

18:46.464 --> 18:48.414
Did you or did you not
smell alcohol

18:48.416 --> 18:49.766
on Officer Grasso's breath?

18:49.768 --> 18:51.083
Well...

18:51.085 --> 18:52.935
Yes or no?

18:54.421 --> 18:57.306
Yes.

18:57.308 --> 18:58.858
And did you try to give him
breath mints

18:58.860 --> 18:59.859
to cover up the fact

18:59.861 --> 19:02.228
that you smelled alcohol on him?

19:03.897 --> 19:05.782
Permission to treat

19:05.784 --> 19:07.734
Officer Reagan
as a hostile witness?

19:07.736 --> 19:09.152
Permission granted.

19:09.154 --> 19:10.936
Officer Reagan,
didn't you take

19:10.938 --> 19:13.373
a pack of breath mints
from the counter of the deli?

19:13.375 --> 19:14.607
Yes.

19:14.609 --> 19:15.708
And the purpose

19:15.710 --> 19:18.294
was to give them
to Officer Grasso, correct?

19:20.330 --> 19:21.798
Was the purpose

19:21.800 --> 19:23.916
to give them to Officer Grasso?

19:26.670 --> 19:28.971
Answer the question, Officer.

19:30.140 --> 19:32.842
Yes, Your Honor.

19:32.844 --> 19:34.260
To mask the smell of alcohol?

19:36.096 --> 19:38.631
Yes.

19:38.633 --> 19:40.683
No further questions,
Your Honor.

19:45.690 --> 19:48.241
You know, I'd be willing to bet

19:48.243 --> 19:49.609
this isn't the first time

19:49.611 --> 19:51.244
that Lacy pulled off
this little stunt.

19:51.246 --> 19:53.496
You know, drop a little
devil's breath in a guy's drink,

19:53.498 --> 19:54.997
then go upstairs
and clean him out.

19:54.999 --> 19:57.500
Hey, easy payday, and you don't
even have to have sex.

19:57.502 --> 19:59.335
Yeah, that would explain
where his credit cards went.

19:59.337 --> 20:01.421
She took them.
Or he gave them to her.

20:01.423 --> 20:02.822
Did you run the, uh, hotel,

20:02.824 --> 20:04.657
see if there were
any complaints filed there?

20:04.659 --> 20:06.259
Yeah, I just did.

20:06.261 --> 20:08.010
Three complaints
in the past two months

20:08.012 --> 20:10.346
from men saying they were
drugged and/or robbed.

20:10.348 --> 20:11.497
Probably the only three

20:11.499 --> 20:13.299
brave enough to
come forward.

20:14.718 --> 20:17.270
Almost all of them
are from out of town.

20:17.272 --> 20:18.855
Welcome to New York.

20:18.857 --> 20:21.357
Wait, you said
<i>almost</i> all of them

20:21.359 --> 20:23.008
are from out of town.

20:23.010 --> 20:24.694
One of them's a New Yorker?

20:24.696 --> 20:26.946
Yeah, one guy, Richard Young,

20:26.948 --> 20:28.981
50s, lives in Midtown.

20:28.983 --> 20:30.950
Well, let's go see
if his memory's

20:30.952 --> 20:32.652
better than Mr. Carter's.

20:33.370 --> 20:35.404
<i>I don't know why</i>

20:35.406 --> 20:37.156
you're making this
such a big deal, Mom.

20:37.158 --> 20:39.125
When the principal starts
talking about suspension,

20:39.127 --> 20:40.259
it's a very big deal.

20:40.261 --> 20:41.644
And there are
other ways to get

20:41.646 --> 20:42.929
the administration's
attention, Nicky.

20:42.931 --> 20:44.030
I have a great way.

20:44.032 --> 20:45.331
Why don't I just
start bringing

20:45.333 --> 20:47.717
drugs into school?

20:47.719 --> 20:49.335
You know what
I don't get?

20:49.337 --> 20:51.003
You always
taught me to fight for

20:51.005 --> 20:52.305
what I believe in,
to fight to make

20:52.307 --> 20:53.539
the world the place I want it

20:53.541 --> 20:55.508
to be, and now that I'm
putting that into practice,

20:55.510 --> 20:56.676
you want me to stop.

20:56.678 --> 20:58.928
I also taught you
to respect authority.

20:58.930 --> 21:00.045
I've been
very respectful, Mom.

21:00.047 --> 21:01.347
I even went to
Mrs. Pender's office today

21:01.349 --> 21:03.215
to ask if we could have
a town hall meeting,

21:03.217 --> 21:04.818
so that the students
and the administration

21:04.819 --> 21:06.385
could have their say.

21:06.387 --> 21:08.020
Well, see, that's a great idea.

21:08.022 --> 21:09.272
And she shut me down completely.

21:09.274 --> 21:11.190
She said if
I continued the protest,

21:11.192 --> 21:12.658
I'm not just gonna be suspended,

21:12.660 --> 21:14.911
she'll make sure
I get kicked out of school.

21:14.913 --> 21:16.279
Wait, she said that?

21:16.281 --> 21:17.580
Yeah, she did.

21:17.582 --> 21:19.565
But the one thing
I can't understand

21:19.567 --> 21:21.751
is how the one person
who always encouraged me

21:21.753 --> 21:23.002
to have convictions and stand up

21:23.004 --> 21:24.570
for what I believe
in is now being

21:24.572 --> 21:27.006
so critical.

21:33.046 --> 21:35.181
Mr. Young, I'm Detective Reagan.

21:35.183 --> 21:36.516
This is Detective Baez.

21:36.518 --> 21:38.634
We wanted to ask you some
questions about a complaint

21:38.636 --> 21:40.603
you filed while you were
staying at the Camelot Hotel

21:40.605 --> 21:41.637
earlier this year.

21:41.639 --> 21:42.855
Yeah.

21:42.857 --> 21:45.608
My wife is inside.

21:45.610 --> 21:47.560
Um, we don't want to get you
in trouble with the missus.

21:47.562 --> 21:48.528
So, why don't we go talk

21:48.530 --> 21:50.029
over here, okay?
Yeah, sounds good.

21:50.031 --> 21:53.366
We just need your help
identifying a woman

21:53.368 --> 21:55.067
who's been
targeting men at bars,

21:55.069 --> 21:56.769
stealing their
personal belongings.

21:56.771 --> 21:58.487
Is that what happened to you?

21:58.489 --> 22:00.706
She took $800 from me.

22:00.708 --> 22:02.542
And all of my credit cards.

22:02.544 --> 22:04.109
'Kay, who is this "she"?

22:04.111 --> 22:05.912
Lacy. I didn't...

22:05.914 --> 22:08.080
didn't get a last name.
Is this her?

22:09.583 --> 22:12.585
Oh, my God. Yeah.

22:12.587 --> 22:14.470
Yeah. That's-that's Lacy.

22:14.472 --> 22:16.055
Okay.

22:16.057 --> 22:17.390
So, she approached
you at the hotel bar.

22:17.392 --> 22:18.457
Is that what happened?

22:18.459 --> 22:19.508
Uh, no.

22:19.510 --> 22:22.979
We... we met at a-a strip club

22:22.981 --> 22:24.814
a couple blocks away,
and then we, um...

22:24.816 --> 22:26.983
we walked back to the hotel.

22:26.985 --> 22:28.601
We went upstairs
and opened up the bar,

22:28.603 --> 22:29.969
and I made us
both a drink,

22:29.971 --> 22:31.404
and...

22:31.406 --> 22:34.190
after that,
I don't remember a damn thing.

22:34.192 --> 22:36.809
I woke up,
and everything was gone.

22:36.811 --> 22:38.611
What was the name
of the strip club?

22:38.613 --> 22:40.029
Scores.

22:40.031 --> 22:42.331
She works there?
She a dancer?

22:42.333 --> 22:44.367
She was that night.

22:44.369 --> 22:45.651
I'll bet.

22:46.503 --> 22:48.621
Thanks for your time.

22:51.091 --> 22:53.325
This concludes
the proceedings.

22:59.132 --> 23:00.683
Hey, Pete. Uh...

23:00.685 --> 23:02.602
about my testimony
back there,

23:02.604 --> 23:04.553
I wasn't trying to...
It's all right.

23:04.555 --> 23:06.338
I know how these things work.

23:06.340 --> 23:08.107
Well, I wish I could've
just said what I think,

23:08.109 --> 23:09.475
which is that you did
the right thing.

23:09.477 --> 23:11.527
I know, I know.

23:11.529 --> 23:13.312
I'm sorry you're going
through all this.

23:13.314 --> 23:14.346
Me, too.

23:14.348 --> 23:16.232
That night...

23:16.234 --> 23:19.485
Makes me wish I would've
just kept walking.

23:34.067 --> 23:35.968
Excuse me.
Yeah?

23:35.970 --> 23:37.336
Where's your owner?

23:43.977 --> 23:45.928
Excuse me. Detective Reagan.

23:45.930 --> 23:48.180
This is Detective Baez.
You the owner?

23:48.182 --> 23:51.050
Something tells me you're
not here for a lap dance.

23:51.902 --> 23:54.437
You recognize her?

23:54.439 --> 23:55.688
Lacy.

23:55.690 --> 23:57.023
How about
her real name?

23:57.025 --> 23:59.025
Jennifer Riley.
What did she do now?

23:59.027 --> 24:00.910
What do you mean,
"What did she do now"?

24:00.912 --> 24:02.778
Look, I'll tell you something
right now, I never bought

24:02.780 --> 24:04.497
any of those stolen
credit cards.

24:04.499 --> 24:07.667
Well, that's lucky
for you then.

24:07.669 --> 24:09.752
That's not why you're here.

24:09.754 --> 24:11.337
Where can we find her?

24:11.339 --> 24:12.738
She's in the
dressing room.

24:12.740 --> 24:14.573
Look, she's going on
in half an hour.

24:14.575 --> 24:16.959
Well, think you're gonna
have to find a backup dancer.

24:16.961 --> 24:19.428
Why don't you take us over
to the dressing room, okay?

24:19.430 --> 24:22.431
Right this way.

24:22.433 --> 24:24.517
That's her locker.

24:24.519 --> 24:27.136
She was right here a minute ago.

24:27.138 --> 24:29.088
Where's your back door?

24:29.090 --> 24:30.422
Through this door.

24:34.978 --> 24:37.496
Hey! Hold it!

24:38.398 --> 24:39.598
Hold it!

24:40.701 --> 24:42.101
Police! Hey!

24:42.103 --> 24:43.102
Stop the car.

24:43.104 --> 24:44.620
Come on.

24:44.622 --> 24:45.871
Let's go. Get out!

24:45.873 --> 24:47.606
What?
Hands against the vehicle.

24:47.608 --> 24:48.908
Right now!

24:48.910 --> 24:50.626
Cuff her.
I got it.

24:50.628 --> 24:52.611
Jennifer Riley,
you're under arrest.

24:52.613 --> 24:54.046
What for? I didn't do anything.

24:54.048 --> 24:56.415
So, night on the town
turns into a dead body, huh?

24:56.417 --> 24:59.018
You got some explaining
to do, hot stuff.

24:59.020 --> 25:01.187
Let's go.

25:13.863 --> 25:15.814
I didn't drug anyone.

25:15.816 --> 25:18.834
And he gave me
his credit cards.

25:18.836 --> 25:20.119
Why?

25:20.121 --> 25:22.487
Because he was impressed
with your dancing abilities?

25:22.489 --> 25:23.822
Ms. Reagan.

25:23.824 --> 25:26.291
Criminal possession
of stolen property

25:26.293 --> 25:27.376
is a felony-- four years.

25:27.378 --> 25:28.594
Murder in
the second degree is...

25:28.596 --> 25:31.130
Oh, please. Come on.

25:31.132 --> 25:33.132
You can't pin a murder on me.

25:33.134 --> 25:35.834
Either way, you're looking
at jail time for possession.

25:36.669 --> 25:38.037
Is that true?

25:39.622 --> 25:42.775
I didn't murder that woman.

25:42.777 --> 25:44.393
But if you want
to talk deal,

25:44.395 --> 25:46.845
I might be able to
tell you who did.

25:46.847 --> 25:48.513
Not another word.

25:48.515 --> 25:50.983
Criminal possession
in the third degree.

25:50.985 --> 25:52.618
Criminal
possession in the fifth.

25:52.620 --> 25:54.486
That's a misdemeanor.

25:54.488 --> 25:56.455
Yeah, and she's giving you
a murder conviction.

25:56.457 --> 25:59.191
Is it an eyewitness testimony,
and is she going to testify?

25:59.193 --> 26:00.909
Yes.

26:00.911 --> 26:02.861
Start talking.

26:02.863 --> 26:04.513
The deal expires

26:04.515 --> 26:05.864
in five minutes.

26:05.866 --> 26:08.333
I started talking to Robert
at the bar.

26:08.335 --> 26:11.136
He asked me to take a walk
because he wanted...

26:11.138 --> 26:14.006
uh, to get some cash at an ATM.

26:14.008 --> 26:15.507
Why?

26:15.509 --> 26:17.810
Honey, when a man wants
to take money at an ATM

26:17.812 --> 26:19.928
and spend it on me, I
don't usually ask why.

26:19.930 --> 26:21.546
We walked back
to his hotel,

26:21.548 --> 26:23.849
and we went up, um...

26:23.851 --> 26:25.317
to his room.

26:25.319 --> 26:26.985
For what purpose?

26:28.488 --> 26:32.407
To hang out, to have a drink.

26:32.409 --> 26:35.244
And then his girlfriend
showed up.

26:35.246 --> 26:37.279
She was...

26:37.281 --> 26:38.447
she was really
pissed off.

26:38.449 --> 26:39.698
She started
accusing him

26:39.700 --> 26:42.167
of cheating on her, of
standing her up, and...

26:42.169 --> 26:46.455
she started yelling and...
she was pushing him.

26:46.457 --> 26:50.509
And he pulled out a knife,
and he stabbed her to death.

26:50.511 --> 26:52.711
So you witnessed him
kill this girl?

26:53.880 --> 26:55.130
And what'd you do?

26:55.132 --> 26:57.883
I just got out of there
as fast as I could.

26:57.885 --> 26:59.218
You didn't think

26:59.220 --> 27:03.055
to notify the hotel security
or call 911 to report it?

27:03.057 --> 27:05.858
No.

27:05.860 --> 27:09.812
Because I thought you...
would pin this on me.

27:09.814 --> 27:12.698
Which is pretty much
what happened, right?

27:19.906 --> 27:22.440
All I see
is a typical guy

27:22.442 --> 27:24.159
who got suckered
by a pretty face,

27:24.161 --> 27:25.777
ended up killing
his girlfriend.

27:25.779 --> 27:27.462
He's probably gonna
blame it on the drugs.

27:27.464 --> 27:28.964
Be nice if
they had a drug

27:28.966 --> 27:30.549
that could make us
forget certain things.

27:30.551 --> 27:31.834
Like what?

27:31.836 --> 27:34.386
Every dead body I've ever
seen at a crime scene.

27:34.388 --> 27:37.472
I rebuilt the old stock parts,
so the numbers match.

27:37.474 --> 27:39.474
All the original miles.

27:39.476 --> 27:41.093
Back at work already,
huh, Mr. Carter?

27:41.095 --> 27:44.296
Uh, actually, I just wanted
to sign over my inventory.

27:44.298 --> 27:45.964
I just want
to go home.

27:45.966 --> 27:48.300
Well, unfortunately
that's not happening today.

27:48.302 --> 27:49.935
Did you find out anything?

27:49.937 --> 27:52.104
Found out
you killed your girlfriend.

27:52.106 --> 27:53.405
What?

27:53.407 --> 27:55.073
Turn around, please.

27:55.075 --> 27:57.409
- N... No, no, no.
- Come on.

27:57.411 --> 28:01.029
Turn around.
We got an eyewitness.

28:01.031 --> 28:03.198
Oh, my God.

28:05.001 --> 28:06.952
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

28:06.954 --> 28:08.954
So are we.
Let's go.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.592
<i>Bless these gifts</i>

28:13.594 --> 28:16.762
which we are about to receive
through Christ, our Lord. Amen.

28:16.764 --> 28:18.163
Amen.

28:18.165 --> 28:20.599
Good job, Sean.

28:20.601 --> 28:22.801
When we say grace in school,
our teacher makes us

28:22.803 --> 28:25.003
tell everyone what
we're grateful for.

28:25.005 --> 28:26.504
What are you grateful for?

28:26.506 --> 28:29.141
I'm grateful that I'm a better
kicker than Austin Jenner

28:29.143 --> 28:31.843
in soccer, even though it's
his fault my arm's in a sling.

28:31.845 --> 28:33.779
I'm grateful that Linda
made her scalloped potatoes,

28:33.781 --> 28:36.181
'cause I'm tired
of eating healthy.

28:36.183 --> 28:38.016
Anyone else?

28:41.020 --> 28:44.623
Wow. Has everybody had
that bad of a week?

28:44.625 --> 28:46.191
Guess I should be

28:46.193 --> 28:48.210
grateful I'm not Peter Grasso.

28:48.212 --> 28:49.694
Yeah, no good deed

28:49.696 --> 28:51.046
goes unpunished.

28:51.048 --> 28:53.582
What do you think the
departmental hearing will find?

28:53.584 --> 28:55.050
That he's guilty

28:55.052 --> 28:57.035
of violating procedure.

28:57.037 --> 28:59.421
Because he had a couple drinks
at a retirement party?

28:59.423 --> 29:01.590
No, because he blew
a point zero eight.

29:01.592 --> 29:03.558
Wait, so let me
get this straight.

29:03.560 --> 29:05.644
This guy is being
charged by the NYPD,

29:05.646 --> 29:07.145
not the D.A.'s office?

29:07.147 --> 29:08.647
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

29:08.649 --> 29:10.682
For doing what he was
trained to do.

29:10.684 --> 29:13.352
You draw your weapon,
you better be stone-cold sober.

29:13.354 --> 29:15.187
It is not
the commissioner's job

29:15.189 --> 29:18.190
to pick or choose
when to enforce the guidelines.

29:18.192 --> 29:19.908
Personally, I think
it's a good rule.

29:19.910 --> 29:21.360
And cops shouldn't carry guns

29:21.362 --> 29:22.778
if they know
they're gonna be drinking.

29:22.780 --> 29:25.063
Well, it's not quite
that simple, Nicky.

29:25.065 --> 29:27.449
What? He could've just called it
in and waited for help, right?

29:27.451 --> 29:29.534
So you're advocating that
people follow the rules

29:29.536 --> 29:31.536
that are laid
out for them?

29:31.538 --> 29:33.255
Look, it's true

29:33.257 --> 29:34.873
he could've just
called it in and waited,

29:34.875 --> 29:36.792
but it's also true
that if he did,

29:36.794 --> 29:38.627
three civilians
might have been dead.

29:38.629 --> 29:40.629
Let's say you had
a couple of glasses

29:40.631 --> 29:42.597
of wine with dinner,

29:42.599 --> 29:46.251
and then on your way home with
your best friend, who's driving,

29:46.253 --> 29:48.103
he has a heart attack.

29:48.105 --> 29:50.055
Do you jump behind the wheel
and take him

29:50.057 --> 29:53.191
to an E.R., or do you wait
for help to come?

29:54.694 --> 29:56.311
I can't deal in what-ifs.

29:56.313 --> 29:57.562
It's a judgment call.

29:57.564 --> 29:58.814
Unless you're a cop.

29:58.816 --> 30:01.149
And then the judgments
are made for you.

30:01.151 --> 30:03.535
That's right. There's no
other job on earth where you got

30:03.537 --> 30:05.320
to be fit for duty
24 hours a day,

30:05.322 --> 30:06.538
whether you're
working work or not.

30:06.540 --> 30:09.041
Yeah, if Grasso was
a regular civilian,

30:09.043 --> 30:11.293
probably never would've
ended up on the front page.

30:11.295 --> 30:12.444
Sure he would have.

30:12.446 --> 30:13.829
It just would've said
"Good Samaritan"

30:13.831 --> 30:16.081
instead of "Drunk Cop."

30:26.726 --> 30:29.311
You're sitting
in my chair.

30:29.313 --> 30:31.263
Where's Norma Rae?

30:31.265 --> 30:33.982
Beating Pop at poker.

30:33.984 --> 30:37.903
I thought sitting in your chair
would inspire me with wisdom.

30:40.156 --> 30:41.806
It's not working.

30:44.077 --> 30:47.812
How does it feel going from
rebel to disciplinarian?

30:47.814 --> 30:49.481
I was never a rebel.

30:49.483 --> 30:51.149
Sister Margaret Mary.

30:51.151 --> 30:53.151
I was never suspended.

30:53.153 --> 30:55.670
Only because your mom went
to see her and fought for you.

30:55.672 --> 30:57.172
Really?

30:57.174 --> 31:00.092
Yeah. Really.

31:01.794 --> 31:04.262
Don't tell me you're taking
Nicky's side here.

31:04.264 --> 31:07.049
I'm not taking sides.

31:07.850 --> 31:09.384
But you are

31:09.386 --> 31:10.602
raising a pretty good kid.

31:10.604 --> 31:11.937
I just don't think
she realizes

31:11.939 --> 31:15.440
how a disciplinary action
is gonna look on her record.

31:15.442 --> 31:18.393
Or what if it affects
her getting into college?

31:18.395 --> 31:23.148
What-ifs are unknowable;
you should decide on the merits.

31:23.150 --> 31:25.817
So should you, Dad.

31:32.858 --> 31:34.910
You look like you've
been here a while.

31:34.912 --> 31:36.861
Since 4:00 a.m.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.085
You could use that more than me.

31:43.087 --> 31:44.202
Yeah.

31:44.204 --> 31:46.171
The Carter case, isn't it?

31:46.173 --> 31:48.090
Yeah.

31:48.092 --> 31:49.808
I knew you weren't
gonna let that go.

31:49.810 --> 31:51.876
Call me crazy, but...

31:51.878 --> 31:53.929
eh, I believe the kid.

31:53.931 --> 31:55.931
I mean, don't you
need a reason

31:55.933 --> 31:58.817
to kill somebody
that you're about to propose to?

31:58.819 --> 32:00.936
According to Jennifer,
it was heat of the moment.

32:00.938 --> 32:02.104
We've seen that before.

32:02.106 --> 32:04.656
That girl-- I'm
sorry-- her statement

32:04.658 --> 32:06.324
is not enough for me.

32:06.326 --> 32:08.193
It's not enough to
put that kid away

32:08.195 --> 32:09.861
for 25 years to life.

32:09.863 --> 32:11.863
And until I know exactly
what the hell happened

32:11.865 --> 32:13.832
in that room,
I'm not gonna do it.

32:15.668 --> 32:17.002
Okay.

32:17.004 --> 32:18.453
So?

32:18.455 --> 32:21.072
So... those three
other complaints--

32:21.074 --> 32:22.958
the guys who
were drugged

32:22.960 --> 32:26.261
and robbed--
what if she had help?

32:27.763 --> 32:29.747
What if she didn't do it alone?

32:30.583 --> 32:32.584
You're right.

32:32.586 --> 32:34.803
I'll go over the 61s again.

32:34.805 --> 32:36.521
I'm gonna head back
to that strip club and see

32:36.523 --> 32:37.939
if there's something
we missed.

32:37.941 --> 32:40.125
Hey. Thank you.

32:43.530 --> 32:45.397
Detective, you're back.
Yeah, I just wanted to take

32:45.399 --> 32:46.931
a second look around.
Oh, yeah, no,

32:46.933 --> 32:48.200
I bet you did.
What?

32:48.202 --> 32:50.202
In fact, if you want
a lap dance or...

32:50.204 --> 32:52.270
No, that's not what
I-- No, no, no, no.

32:52.272 --> 32:54.773
I just want to take a second
look around the dressing room.

32:54.775 --> 32:56.107
Oh. Go right ahead.

32:56.109 --> 32:57.742
We got nothing
to hide around here.

32:57.744 --> 32:59.110
Great.

32:59.112 --> 33:01.296
This one?
Mm-hmm.

33:01.298 --> 33:02.814
"I am a money magnet.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.816
"My income is
constantly increasing.

33:04.818 --> 33:06.668
Money comes to me
frequently and easily."

33:06.670 --> 33:08.170
What the hell
does that mean?

33:08.172 --> 33:09.888
It's the stripper's creed.
Oh.

33:09.890 --> 33:13.725
Problem with Lacy, if it doesn't
come to her, she takes it.

33:13.727 --> 33:16.811
Good to know.
Do you mind opening this?

33:16.813 --> 33:19.097
Thank you.
Voilà.

33:23.986 --> 33:27.272
Son of a bitch.

33:27.274 --> 33:28.740
Baez.

33:30.159 --> 33:33.662
You're never gonna guess
who Lacy is cozy with.

33:34.747 --> 33:37.482
Oh, I think we found
our common denominator:

33:37.484 --> 33:41.453
the bartender
from Carter's hotel bar.

33:48.394 --> 33:49.761
Okay, think we got it.

33:49.763 --> 33:51.012
Thank you.

33:51.014 --> 33:52.063
Thank you, kids.

33:52.065 --> 33:53.548
Congrats.

33:53.550 --> 33:54.883
We hope the Police
Sports League can fund

33:54.885 --> 33:56.668
new programs with that.
Thank you.

33:56.670 --> 33:58.637
You bet.
Thank you.

34:01.941 --> 34:05.560
Judge Keller is recommending
termination of Officer Grasso.

34:05.562 --> 34:07.279
And the press
are looking

34:07.281 --> 34:08.647
for a comment from you.

34:08.649 --> 34:10.331
I want a press conference.

34:10.333 --> 34:12.400
There's really no need for a press...
I didn't say

34:12.402 --> 34:14.202
there was a need;
I said a want one.

34:14.204 --> 34:17.155
The cops are unhappy,
the mayor's happy.

34:17.157 --> 34:20.190
I think you're really better
off letting things lie, Frank.

34:20.193 --> 34:22.877
I also want a copy
of Judge Keller's opinion.

34:22.879 --> 34:25.630
I need to know
what you're gonna say.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.500
So do I.

34:39.797 --> 34:42.244
We will
fight for student rights!

34:42.344 --> 34:44.408
We will fight
for student rights!

34:44.587 --> 34:47.187
We will fight for
student rights!

34:47.188 --> 34:49.672
We will fight
for student rights!

34:49.675 --> 34:52.443
We will fight for
student rights!

34:52.445 --> 34:56.263
Students of Blessed Heart
who do not disperse immediately

34:56.264 --> 34:59.900
will be suspended
indefinitely, and face

34:59.902 --> 35:01.602
disciplinary action.

35:03.355 --> 35:06.006
I repeat,
students of Blessed Heart

35:06.008 --> 35:08.609
who do not disperse
immediately will be

35:08.611 --> 35:10.778
suspended indefinitely and...

35:12.198 --> 35:13.897
Isn't that your mom?

35:13.899 --> 35:15.199
Yeah.

35:15.201 --> 35:16.950
What's she doing?

35:16.952 --> 35:19.903
I don't know.

35:34.052 --> 35:36.036
You have a pretty good turnout.

35:36.038 --> 35:38.338
What did you say
to Mrs. Pender?

35:38.340 --> 35:40.641
Well, I just told her
what you would have said

35:40.643 --> 35:42.176
if you went
to law school.

35:42.178 --> 35:43.760
That a peaceful protest

35:43.762 --> 35:47.064
after school hours and
not on school property

35:47.066 --> 35:49.683
is actually protected
by the First Amendment.

35:49.685 --> 35:51.735
So they can't suspend us?

35:51.737 --> 35:55.388
No. Not that I want you
to make a habit of this.

35:55.390 --> 35:57.691
No, I know, I get it, but...

35:57.693 --> 35:59.159
Wow.

35:59.161 --> 36:01.778
"Wow"?

36:01.780 --> 36:05.332
That was just really cool, Mom.

36:05.334 --> 36:09.086
"Cool"? Well, I have not
been cool in a very long time.

36:09.088 --> 36:10.954
I'm gonna savor this moment.

36:10.956 --> 36:12.956
Well, the way I understand it,

36:12.958 --> 36:16.176
I'm really just a chip
off the old block.

36:17.245 --> 36:18.912
Grandpa told me
how you started a petition

36:18.914 --> 36:20.597
to allow girls
on the boys' soccer team

36:20.599 --> 36:22.049
when you were in high school.

36:22.967 --> 36:26.637
Absolutely nothing is sacred
in this family.

36:36.731 --> 36:38.265
Oh, I'm sorry.

36:38.267 --> 36:39.900
Am I interrupting?

36:39.902 --> 36:41.485
Maybe we'll try

36:41.487 --> 36:43.070
the radio room instead.

36:43.072 --> 36:44.771
Come on.

36:44.773 --> 36:46.623
What is this about?

36:46.625 --> 36:47.774
I'll escort Ms. Salazar.

36:47.776 --> 36:49.109
You can take
Jennifer's statement.

36:49.111 --> 36:50.043
What statement?

36:50.045 --> 36:51.545
Jennifer's
been released.

36:51.547 --> 36:53.630
Well, how would you know?

36:53.632 --> 36:57.634
Don't you only
know her as "Chardonnay"?

36:57.636 --> 36:59.720
Go ahead.

36:59.722 --> 37:00.921
Go.

37:05.927 --> 37:08.962
Well, you look
a little concerned, Jennifer.

37:08.964 --> 37:10.597
Or is it, uh, Lacy?

37:10.599 --> 37:12.599
Or Chardonnay?

37:13.818 --> 37:16.103
What's wrong?
You concerned that

37:16.105 --> 37:18.572
your, uh, girlfriend out
there is gonna flip on you?

37:22.243 --> 37:24.077
Hmm?

37:24.079 --> 37:25.979
I-I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:25.981 --> 37:27.948
Detective, my client
has made a deal.

37:27.950 --> 37:29.283
Your client
<i>had</i> a deal.

37:29.285 --> 37:30.617
That was until
we discovered

37:30.619 --> 37:33.370
that her and her girlfriend
were running a robbery ring.

37:35.924 --> 37:38.926
Thing is, these guys
that you rob...

37:38.928 --> 37:40.510
they're cheaters.

37:40.512 --> 37:42.930
Right? I mean, they're
guys stepping out

37:42.932 --> 37:44.181
on their wives and girlfriends,

37:44.183 --> 37:46.717
so who the hell cares
if you victimize them?

37:46.719 --> 37:49.136
But Robert Carter--

37:49.138 --> 37:50.670
he was an exception.

37:50.672 --> 37:52.389
He was a good guy.

37:52.391 --> 37:55.642
He was at that hotel not
to hook up with somebody,

37:55.644 --> 37:58.362
he was there to propose
to his girlfriend.

37:58.364 --> 38:00.781
He even got her
an engagement ring.

38:00.783 --> 38:03.367
If you're not charging
my client, we're leaving.

38:03.369 --> 38:06.320
You can leave if you want to,
but I'd get used to this place,

38:06.322 --> 38:08.322
'cause you will be back.

38:08.324 --> 38:09.406
You threatening us?

38:09.408 --> 38:10.457
I don't make threats,

38:10.459 --> 38:11.825
but I'll promise you this.

38:11.827 --> 38:13.526
I will sit down
with Robert Carter,

38:13.528 --> 38:15.545
and I will tell him <i>exactly</i>

38:15.547 --> 38:18.031
what the hell happened
to his fiancée,

38:18.033 --> 38:20.367
and I will not rest until I do.

38:27.892 --> 38:29.309
Yeah?

38:29.311 --> 38:31.511
I can't crack
her; she wants a lawyer.

38:34.432 --> 38:36.016
Okay.

38:36.018 --> 38:38.101
Well, this one
doesn't know that.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.220
Okay, great, Detective.

38:40.222 --> 38:42.239
Why don't you go back,
finish up her statement,

38:42.241 --> 38:43.556
then we'll wrap this up.

38:45.243 --> 38:47.327
Well, what do you know.

38:47.329 --> 38:50.230
Looks like your time is up
there, uh, Lacy.

38:51.115 --> 38:53.000
Seems your girlfriend is...

38:53.002 --> 38:56.236
more interested in saving
her own ass than she is

38:56.238 --> 38:57.204
in saving yours.

38:57.206 --> 38:59.206
You're lying.

38:59.208 --> 39:00.290
No, I'm not.

39:00.292 --> 39:02.709
I don't think
she's lying either.

39:06.047 --> 39:07.964
By the way...

39:07.966 --> 39:10.750
that is a lovely engagement ring
you got there.

39:10.752 --> 39:12.585
Where'd you get it?

39:12.587 --> 39:15.689
'Cause I have a buddy
who just lost one.

39:19.394 --> 39:20.977
No!

39:23.364 --> 39:25.732
We just wanted his money.

39:25.734 --> 39:28.368
We had no idea
his girlfriend would show up.

39:28.370 --> 39:30.153
So what happened when she did?

39:30.155 --> 39:31.288
Don't answer!

39:31.290 --> 39:34.241
That bitch was gonna
call the cops on us.

39:36.944 --> 39:39.663
"That bitch."

39:47.788 --> 39:49.756
How you doing, Robert?

39:49.758 --> 39:51.624
I don't know.

39:51.626 --> 39:53.009
Well, if it helps
at all,

39:53.011 --> 39:56.430
it was the bartender
that killed Madeline.

39:58.099 --> 40:00.267
We know it wasn't you.

40:00.269 --> 40:01.968
Soon as they finish
your paperwork,

40:01.970 --> 40:03.687
you'll be
free to go, and...

40:03.689 --> 40:06.139
try to put this all behind you.

40:06.974 --> 40:09.192
I-I guess it's...

40:09.194 --> 40:11.578
supposed to make me
feel better, right?

40:11.580 --> 40:13.246
But, uh...

40:13.248 --> 40:17.918
I don't feel anything,
Detective.

40:17.920 --> 40:21.588
Except the same pit
in my stomach,

40:21.590 --> 40:24.257
because I'll never
see her again,

40:24.259 --> 40:27.594
I'll never talk
to her again,

40:27.596 --> 40:31.882
I never told her how important
she was to me, and...

40:31.884 --> 40:35.335
now I'll never get that chance.

40:40.057 --> 40:42.192
Robert...

40:42.194 --> 40:44.194
you held her

40:44.196 --> 40:48.014
in your arms
while she was dying.

40:49.683 --> 40:52.736
That's how you got the blood
all over your clothes.

40:52.738 --> 40:56.039
And given the circumstances,
I'd say...

40:56.041 --> 40:59.192
there's nothing more
you could've done at that point.

41:03.631 --> 41:06.500
Because of you,
she didn't die alone.

41:15.726 --> 41:18.545
<i>In regard to the incident</i>

41:18.547 --> 41:21.548
involving Officer Peter Grasso,

41:21.550 --> 41:24.768
Judge Keller has concluded
the departmental hearing

41:24.770 --> 41:28.188
with a guilty verdict and a
recommendation for termination.

41:28.190 --> 41:31.908
As the New York City
Police Commissioner,

41:31.910 --> 41:33.860
I can exercise discretion

41:33.862 --> 41:37.581
and amend or overturn
this decision.

41:40.368 --> 41:42.919
Officer Grasso...

41:42.921 --> 41:44.421
will not be pardoned.

41:44.423 --> 41:47.574
There is no disputing
he was over the legal limit

41:47.576 --> 41:50.577
when he chose to act.

41:50.579 --> 41:52.579
He did the right thing,

41:52.581 --> 41:57.050
for the right reasons,
at the right time,

41:57.052 --> 41:59.352
under unfortunate circumstances.

41:59.354 --> 42:04.140
And it is hard for
this commissioner to understand

42:04.142 --> 42:07.811
how our city would have
been better served

42:07.813 --> 42:12.399
had he simply called 911
and moved on.

42:12.401 --> 42:15.285
He made a mistake,

42:15.287 --> 42:18.038
but Peter Grasso
is the kind of police officer

42:18.040 --> 42:20.240
I want to serve with.

42:21.742 --> 42:25.278
He will be given
a 30-day suspension

42:25.280 --> 42:28.915
and a one-year probation.

42:28.917 --> 42:32.335
But he <i>will</i> keep his job.

42:38.459 --> 42:39.993
Will this
decision involve

42:39.995 --> 42:41.761
changing NYPD policy,
Commissioner?

42:41.763 --> 42:43.346
What are you gonna
do now, Frank?

42:43.348 --> 42:45.732
I'm gonna go home
and have a drink.
