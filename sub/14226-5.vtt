WEBVTT

00:04.225 --> 00:06.225
We came here seeking refuge,

00:06.242 --> 00:08.274
but the Humans thought
that it was an invasion.

00:08.505 --> 00:10.575
(All yelling)

00:10.991 --> 00:13.991
That night, I met a Human girl
who tried to protect me.

00:13.992 --> 00:15.792
A girl I never thought I'd see again.

00:16.415 --> 00:17.881
The surviving members of my race,

00:17.883 --> 00:19.283
<i>the Atrians, were rounded up</i>

00:19.285 --> 00:21.786
<i>and isolated inside
a militarized sector.</i>

00:21.788 --> 00:23.988
<i>Now it's 2024.</i>

00:23.990 --> 00:25.991
<i>Seven of us have been chosen
to attend high school</i>

00:26.016 --> 00:28.492
as a part of a government
integration program.

00:28.493 --> 00:29.759
<i>But the humans and Atrians</i>

00:29.761 --> 00:32.003
<i>continue to distrust
each other,</i>

00:32.005 --> 00:35.005
while I fight to protect my people,
and the Human girl

00:35.006 --> 00:36.605
who saved my life at any cost.

00:37.093 --> 00:39.927
<i>Previously on Star-Crossed...</i>

00:39.929 --> 00:41.974
JULIA: Isn't it illegal
for Atrians to have phones?

00:41.999 --> 00:44.375
Yes, but it's important that
I find out what's on this one.

00:45.266 --> 00:47.766
Do you have any idea why my
father would have had that phone?

00:47.991 --> 00:49.491
Whoever your father was talking to,

00:49.493 --> 00:50.528
it was someone Human.

00:50.529 --> 00:53.029
The closer she is to me,
the more danger she's in.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.964
You won't even talk to me now?

00:54.965 --> 00:56.716
I can't.

00:56.718 --> 00:57.984
<i>Some of these Tatties</i>

00:57.986 --> 01:00.522
have learn how to remove their markings

01:00.547 --> 01:03.089
and embed themselves in our society?

01:03.890 --> 01:05.459
(Gasping)

01:05.459 --> 01:06.907
He was a traitor.

01:06.908 --> 01:08.207
We will unleash

01:08.209 --> 01:13.045
black cyper on the humans.

01:13.547 --> 01:15.247
Tomorrow begins

01:15.249 --> 01:17.716
a new phase of the integration program.

01:17.718 --> 01:21.790
The Atrian Seven will be
taken by bus into town.

01:21.791 --> 01:24.791
Once there, you'll be
free to explore Edendale.

01:25.592 --> 01:26.992
Now, your curfew still stands.

01:26.994 --> 01:28.493
The bus will take you back

01:28.495 --> 01:31.231
to the Sector at 9:00 pm sharp.

01:31.233 --> 01:33.267
So a dog with a longer leash.

01:33.292 --> 01:35.091
We haven't put you down yet.

01:35.092 --> 01:36.625
It's an opportunity for Atrians

01:36.721 --> 01:38.320
to experience more of human culture.

01:38.322 --> 01:41.556
- Is it even safe for the Atrians?
- SEU guards

01:41.558 --> 01:44.626
will be patrolling Edendale just
like they do here at Marshall.

01:44.628 --> 01:46.228
And we can go anywhere we want?

01:46.230 --> 01:47.528
I'd rather go back to the Sector.

01:47.529 --> 01:49.095
Now, there's an idea.

01:49.227 --> 01:50.860
We'll be monitoring your
progress very closely

01:50.862 --> 01:52.628
over the next few months.

01:52.630 --> 01:55.266
If you break these rules,
you'll lose those privileges.

01:55.267 --> 01:59.542
But if you obey by now, it can
lead to greater freedoms outside

01:59.543 --> 02:01.786
the Sector for all Atrians.

02:02.941 --> 02:05.941
(School bell rings)

02:09.294 --> 02:10.793
Congrats.

02:10.794 --> 02:12.832
This is pretty epic.

02:12.878 --> 02:15.877
Do you think they're ready
for the main streets in Edendale?

02:15.878 --> 02:17.977
I guess we'll find out.

02:17.978 --> 02:19.877
Well, good luck...

02:19.879 --> 02:21.813
On your new beginning.

02:22.538 --> 02:24.548
- That's it.
- Allright.

02:24.573 --> 02:26.573
You too.

02:26.598 --> 02:30.849
I got them. Two tickets, The
Omen, classic, midnight screening.

02:30.940 --> 02:32.923
You, me, bucket of popcorn...

02:32.924 --> 02:34.226
some scares...

02:34.776 --> 02:36.362
maybe a little cuddling.

02:37.707 --> 02:39.788
Wow, you think of everything.

02:39.802 --> 02:41.301
It's all for you Emery!

02:41.302 --> 02:42.877
(Laughs)

02:42.892 --> 02:45.459
Its... it's from the movie.

02:45.461 --> 02:46.994
Oh I know.

02:46.996 --> 02:50.931
What I didn't know is what
a colossal nerd you are.

02:54.092 --> 02:55.525
Hey, Lukas.

02:55.527 --> 02:57.561
Any luck with the phone?

02:57.563 --> 03:00.063
No, I still haven't been
able to ping its location.

03:00.586 --> 03:03.020
You know, whoever has it
must have turned it off

03:03.022 --> 03:05.689
after they left the swim meet.

03:05.691 --> 03:08.125
You all right?

03:08.127 --> 03:10.578
Yeah. I just... I still can't believe

03:10.579 --> 03:13.203
my father was talking to
someone on a Trag phone.

03:13.204 --> 03:15.157
I was hoping my first night in town

03:15.158 --> 03:16.972
would give me the chance
to find out who it was.

03:16.973 --> 03:20.473
Let me know if that phone is turned on.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.067
<i>FEMALE: Tomorrow, seven Atrians</i>

03:23.069 --> 03:25.737
will be given new freedoms.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.972
For our next move...

03:27.974 --> 03:30.441
The Trags must call on one.

03:33.887 --> 03:35.887

03:39.271 --> 03:40.872
You must deliver this to our operative

03:40.874 --> 03:42.440
living outside the Sector.

03:42.442 --> 03:43.908
She's had her markings removed.

03:43.910 --> 03:45.476
How do I find her?

03:45.477 --> 03:49.044
There's a loose slat under a
blue bench in the town square.

03:49.048 --> 03:50.915
Leave a note for her inside

03:50.917 --> 03:52.750
with a meeting place and time.

03:52.752 --> 03:55.186
Beaumont employed this method to reach her.

03:55.188 --> 03:57.355
It's less risky than traceable technology.

03:57.357 --> 03:59.557
After I deliver it, what then?

03:59.559 --> 04:01.692
The operative will do the rest.

04:01.694 --> 04:05.229
Humans see freedom for
the Seven as the next step

04:05.231 --> 04:06.831
toward peaceful integration.

04:06.833 --> 04:08.899
For us...

04:08.901 --> 04:11.368

04:24.884 --> 04:27.384
I want those animals out of my house.

04:29.120 --> 04:32.188
This is exactly why we
built this safe room.

04:34.626 --> 04:37.895
This is retaliation, isn't it?

04:37.897 --> 04:39.063
For letting

04:39.065 --> 04:40.931
the Atrian Seven into town.

04:40.933 --> 04:42.933
You did this.

04:42.935 --> 04:45.235
I did it for him.

04:45.237 --> 04:47.971
Integration was the only
way to give him a future.

04:47.973 --> 04:50.140
We were lucky we heard the police scanner

04:50.142 --> 04:51.708
and had time to hide.

04:51.710 --> 04:53.143
You heard...

04:53.145 --> 04:55.412
Red Hawks beat a shop owner

04:55.414 --> 04:58.582
half to death for supporting the Atrians.

04:58.584 --> 05:01.451
If they did that to a human,

05:01.453 --> 05:04.955
what do you think they'll do to your son?

05:06.424 --> 05:09.826
I need to take him somewhere he'll be safe.

05:14.566 --> 05:16.667

05:16.669 --> 05:18.902
Nox promised that he
would take our son there

05:18.904 --> 05:20.704
if things ever got too dangerous.

05:20.706 --> 05:24.841
Well, didn't he also say
only an Atrian can find it?

05:27.245 --> 05:29.779
EMERY: It's weird to think that tomorrow

05:29.781 --> 05:32.349
Atrians will walk these
streets for the first time.

05:32.351 --> 05:34.451
It's pretty incredible.

05:34.453 --> 05:37.387
Wish my parents felt that way.

05:37.389 --> 05:39.189
You don't think your parents will order

05:39.191 --> 05:41.124
some kind of Red Hawk attack, do you?

05:41.126 --> 05:42.792
No way. I mean, they hate the Atrians,

05:42.794 --> 05:44.995
but they would never... hurt them.

05:44.997 --> 05:48.398
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have asked.
- No, no.

05:48.400 --> 05:51.301

11:10.857 --> 11:13.024
I'll keep the cube safe
until you make contact

11:13.026 --> 11:15.960
and you're sure the operative's
ready for the handoff.

11:15.962 --> 11:17.728
No, Vega never said
you'd be involved, right?

11:17.730 --> 11:20.598
After you left, she ordered me to help you.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.568
This mission is the Trags' top priority.

TAYLOR: High school boys

No, no, but if Eljida really

Okay. If... If your plan is
to search the entire bayou

13:37.802 --> 13:39.636
How do you get there?

13:39.638 --> 13:43.439
They say the only way to get
to Eljida is with Jesytur.

13:43.441 --> 13:46.242
The Gatekeeper. From Atrian legend.

13:46.244 --> 13:51.247
Oh, right. My parents used to
tell me about Jesytur as a kid.

13:51.249 --> 13:54.717
He's the one that takes people to Eljida?

13:54.719 --> 13:57.186
They say it's so deep in the bayou

13:57.188 --> 13:59.455
that not even an Atrian can swim there.

13:59.457 --> 14:01.424
Jesytur the Boatman has to take you,

14:01.426 --> 14:05.061
and the only way to summon
him is by lighting three fires.

14:06.396 --> 14:09.599
Hey, if Eljida does exist,

14:09.601 --> 14:12.535
you want to help me find it? Tonight?

14:13.904 --> 14:15.304
The last time I snuck off,

14:15.306 --> 14:17.506
the Red Hawks nearly fed me to the gators.

14:17.508 --> 14:20.076
I think I'm gonna go to
the Bug party. Lie low.

excited about learning more

14:28.886 --> 14:32.488
about human culture.

14:32.490 --> 14:35.558
I just don't understand why you
didn't tell the police the truth.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.426
Because Eric didn't deserve
to go down for something

14:37.428 --> 14:39.528
- those other Red Hawks did.
- They're charging you

14:39.530 --> 14:41.430
- with a hate crime, Grayson.
- MR. MONTROSE: Doesn't matter.

14:41.432 --> 14:43.065
Our lawyer spoke with your friend Eric,

14:43.067 --> 14:44.500
and he's gonna confess to all of it.

14:44.502 --> 14:46.502
- He did?
- Yeah.

14:46.504 --> 14:47.736
And Eric's confession will make this

14:47.738 --> 14:49.104
all go away quickly.

14:49.106 --> 14:50.506
We certainly don't want people thinking

14:50.508 --> 14:52.141
the Red Hawks condone
this kind of behavior.

14:52.143 --> 14:53.442
I'm not gonna let you do that.

14:53.444 --> 14:54.710
Don't worry about your friend.

14:54.712 --> 14:56.545
We'll get him a great lawyer,

14:56.547 --> 14:59.114
line up a job for him when he
gets out, look after his family

14:59.116 --> 15:01.417
while he's away... the
kid's getting a good deal.

15:01.419 --> 15:03.619
- A good deal?
- (doorbell rings)

15:05.955 --> 15:07.689
Turns out one of those Red Hawks

15:07.691 --> 15:10.192
roughed up a local shop owner pretty bad.

15:10.194 --> 15:11.527
Put him in the hospital.

15:11.529 --> 15:13.962
All for selling Atrian T-shirts.

15:13.964 --> 15:15.831
Is he gonna be okay?

15:15.833 --> 15:17.566
I hope so.

15:17.568 --> 15:20.102
Now Eric's taking the rap for a hate crime.

15:20.104 --> 15:22.504
And you're sure he's innocent?

15:22.506 --> 15:24.039
Eric's a Red Hawk,

15:24.041 --> 15:25.674
but he would never do
anything to hurt anyone.

15:25.676 --> 15:28.310
And he certainly doesn't
deserve to go to jail.

15:28.312 --> 15:31.747
I just... wish there
was something I could do.

15:31.749 --> 15:33.215
We should go talk to him,

15:33.217 --> 15:34.916
see if there's anything he can remember

15:34.918 --> 15:37.486
from that night to keep
the both of you out of jail.

15:37.488 --> 15:40.088
Why are you doing this?

15:40.090 --> 15:42.891
Um...

15:42.893 --> 15:45.293
if you see something good in Eric,

15:45.295 --> 15:48.530
I'm willing to trust you.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.303
Go... I'll hang out over here.

17:02.305 --> 17:04.939
Give me a signal when you make contact.

17:13.714 --> 17:18.085
I got you a little "welcome
to the real world" gift.

17:18.087 --> 17:19.619
(gasps happily)

17:19.622 --> 17:21.422
I love it!

17:21.424 --> 17:23.523
It's so expensive, though. Are you sure?

17:23.526 --> 17:25.393
Yeah.

17:25.395 --> 17:29.563
I decided tonight everybody
gets what they deserve.

17:29.565 --> 17:32.867
Sophia! You made it.

17:32.869 --> 17:36.103
You, uh, want to look
over the menu with me?

17:36.105 --> 17:38.472
Yeah. She would love to.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.741
(chuckles)

17:40.743 --> 17:42.910
Have fun.

17:49.084 --> 17:51.518
Hey. No, you can't sit here, all right?

17:51.520 --> 17:52.753
I'm waiting for someone.

17:52.755 --> 17:54.221
I'm here.

17:54.223 --> 17:56.323
So the wait is over.

17:57.859 --> 17:59.259
You know what I mean.

17:59.261 --> 18:01.762
No. No.

18:01.764 --> 18:03.630
Don't make me spell it out.

18:03.632 --> 18:06.366
What are you saying?

18:08.436 --> 18:10.070
I mean, it kind of does make sense, right?

18:10.072 --> 18:11.939
In a... a weird way.

18:11.941 --> 18:13.440
Yeah. Yeah.

18:13.442 --> 18:14.942
I think so.

18:14.944 --> 18:16.176
No one would suspect it.

18:16.178 --> 18:19.012
You got that right.

18:20.348 --> 18:22.616
Follow me.

18:35.763 --> 18:38.265
I have what you want.

18:38.267 --> 18:39.466
Just not on me.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.134
But first I need to, uh,

18:41.136 --> 18:42.536
know what happens...

18:42.538 --> 18:44.404
next. Um...

18:48.109 --> 18:49.876
Uh...

18:52.613 --> 18:53.980
What are you doing?

18:53.982 --> 18:55.782
<i>What are you doing?</i>

18:55.784 --> 18:58.952
(chuckles) I... I thought
we came in here to talk.

18:58.954 --> 19:01.354
(chuckles)

19:01.356 --> 19:02.889
Talk?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.924
Mmm.

19:04.926 --> 19:07.727
What kind of talk?

19:07.752 --> 19:09.752
This kind of talk?

19:30.248 --> 19:32.682
Your parents got me a lawyer.
He said if I cop to everything,

19:32.683 --> 19:34.383
I'll just get a couple of months in juvy.

19:34.387 --> 19:35.653
Eric, you shouldn't have to take

19:35.685 --> 19:37.251
the blame for something you didn't do.

19:37.253 --> 19:38.753
I got you into this mess.

19:38.755 --> 19:40.121
I'm not letting you take the fall.

19:40.123 --> 19:42.023
Neither one of you would
have to take the fall

19:42.025 --> 19:44.392
if we found the Red Hawks
who assaulted the shop owner.

19:44.394 --> 19:46.227
If they get away with this,
they could do worse next time.

19:46.290 --> 19:47.899
They didn't tell me their
names. Probably in case

19:47.900 --> 19:49.491
something like this happened.

19:49.493 --> 19:51.126
Do you remember anything about them?

19:51.128 --> 19:53.495
What they were wearing, the
type of car they were driving...

19:53.497 --> 19:54.363
They weren't driving a car.

19:54.365 --> 19:56.866
They were driving bikes. Motorcycles.

19:56.868 --> 19:59.134
The big guy, he had a...

19:59.136 --> 20:01.704
a sexy skeleton custom
paint on his gas tank.

20:01.706 --> 20:03.072
GRAYSON: There are a lot

20:03.074 --> 20:04.506
of biker Red Hawks,

20:04.508 --> 20:05.975
and I know where they hang out.

20:05.977 --> 20:07.543
We can talk to the cops
about looking there first.

20:07.545 --> 20:09.645
And say what? Hey, we don't have a name,

20:09.647 --> 20:12.781
but anybody here want to confess
to beating a man half to death?

20:19.097 --> 20:23.200
Okay, I know that you alien
freaks are really enjoying

20:23.202 --> 20:25.636
your newfound freedoms, but
I'm a little bit busy right now,

20:25.638 --> 20:27.705
so, can you go celebrate with someone else?

20:27.707 --> 20:29.107
Drop the act.

20:29.109 --> 20:32.544
I know who you are,
and I know what you are.

20:32.546 --> 20:34.646
Drake's busy, so I'm taking over.

20:34.648 --> 20:36.247
And I have the cube.

20:40.719 --> 20:42.754
(gasps)

20:42.756 --> 20:45.757
What do you think you're
doing, little girl?

20:47.292 --> 20:50.461
So, is this what working
with you is going to be like?

20:50.463 --> 20:52.063
TAYLOR (laughing): Work?

20:52.065 --> 20:54.832
Felt more like play to me.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.735
(laughs)

20:57.737 --> 21:00.271
Mmm.

21:04.176 --> 21:05.876
(laughing)

21:05.878 --> 21:08.479
Should we be, uh, you know,

21:08.481 --> 21:11.082
on our mission or something?

21:12.050 --> 21:14.719
What are you talking about?

21:14.721 --> 21:17.254
(laughs)

21:20.225 --> 21:22.860
What the hell?

21:24.529 --> 21:28.566
Okay, I think that we are
having a communication problem.

21:32.237 --> 21:33.537
You're human!

21:33.539 --> 21:35.372
Yeah.

21:35.374 --> 21:37.452
That didn't seem to
bother you ten seconds ago.

21:38.084 --> 21:39.984
I don't think you understand who I am.

21:39.986 --> 21:41.786
I have orders to meet Drake here,

21:41.788 --> 21:43.821
and that's what I'm
gonna do, so, where is he?

21:43.823 --> 21:46.557
Like I said, Drake's busy, but I'm here.

21:46.559 --> 21:48.526
Talk to me.

21:48.528 --> 21:50.995
(gasps) Where is Drake?

21:57.303 --> 21:59.370
What the hell is going on here?

22:00.090 --> 22:03.211
_

22:04.514 --> 22:05.276
I can't believe you're my contact.

22:05.278 --> 22:06.678
I can't believe that

22:06.680 --> 22:08.346
Vega saddled me with a rookie meathead

22:08.348 --> 22:10.481
<i>who can't keep his iwap in his pants.</i>

22:10.483 --> 22:12.283
I've been watching you
and Taylor do your little

22:12.285 --> 22:13.351
dance for weeks now,

22:13.353 --> 22:17.155
and I didn't think that you were
actually gonna go through with it.

22:17.157 --> 22:19.223
Do you have any idea what the Trags

22:19.225 --> 22:20.525
are gonna do to you when they find out?

22:20.572 --> 22:21.971
What is she talking about?

22:21.973 --> 22:24.273
I was confused.

22:24.275 --> 22:26.442
We have work to do, and you
already put us behind schedule.

22:26.444 --> 22:28.010
So, let's go.

22:29.346 --> 22:31.113
Cube, please.

22:36.119 --> 22:38.688
Have a nice night.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.983
Jesytur.

23:10.387 --> 23:12.388
(laughs)

23:29.149 --> 23:31.550

- Really?

23:54.028 --> 23:55.427
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Lukas.

23:55.429 --> 23:58.497
Yeah. I was thinking...

23:58.499 --> 24:02.368
(overlapping chatter, techno music playing)

24:08.434 --> 24:10.802
Hey.

24:10.804 --> 24:14.106
What do you think?

24:14.108 --> 24:17.009
You look really sweet and adorable.

24:17.011 --> 24:19.277
But I'm not really in the mood

24:19.279 --> 24:21.279

24:29.822 --> 24:32.257
It's a stupid game.

24:32.259 --> 24:34.192
And you're terrible at it.

24:34.194 --> 24:39.130
Yeah, well, I'm playing
with a handicap, so...

24:39.132 --> 24:41.433
I don't share with humans.

24:41.435 --> 24:46.104
You're stuck here until
your bus comes anyways.

25:00.152 --> 25:02.754
Uh, you mind telling me
what we're doing here?

25:03.256 --> 25:04.555
You're on a need-to-know basis.

25:04.557 --> 25:06.157
And judging from your behavior...

25:06.159 --> 25:08.559
I told you, I thought Taylor
was my contact, all right?

25:08.561 --> 25:10.161
If you thought that that bobble head

25:10.163 --> 25:12.930
was a Trag, then you're
even dumber than she is.

25:12.932 --> 25:14.598
I can't wait for the day that she

25:14.600 --> 25:16.801
and the rest of the humans
are choking on black cyper.

25:16.803 --> 25:18.402
But here's a question.

25:18.404 --> 25:20.371
When Vega learns what you did, do you think

25:20.373 --> 25:22.807
she's gonna slit your throat
first or cut your spinal cord?

25:22.809 --> 25:25.409
- Neither, if you don't tell her.
- I'm a Trag.

25:25.411 --> 25:27.912
We have very strong rules
about how to deal with traitors.

25:27.914 --> 25:30.714
Or did you forget?

25:30.716 --> 25:32.383
Now you dig.

25:43.762 --> 25:46.830
EMERY: Does that qualify
as a sexy skeleton?

25:46.832 --> 25:48.232
(laughs)

25:53.304 --> 25:57.708
Hey, uh, do you know who owns that bike?

25:57.710 --> 25:59.176
I'm looking for a custom paint artist,

25:59.178 --> 26:02.312
and I'd like to know who did it.

26:02.314 --> 26:05.082
It's K.P.'s bike. He's in the back room.

26:05.084 --> 26:07.651
Okay. Uh, thanks.

26:09.320 --> 26:12.556
Listen, uh...

26:12.558 --> 26:15.392
I should go in alone in case it gets weird.

26:15.894 --> 26:17.727
I don't think that's a good idea.

26:17.729 --> 26:19.663
Look, we have a name,
but I need to see his face

26:19.665 --> 26:22.366
and make sure he's the guy that
jumped in the back of my car.

26:22.368 --> 26:23.934
Then we take off, call the cops.

26:23.936 --> 26:25.168
We'll make it to Lukas's party

26:25.170 --> 26:26.537
before all the crawfish are gone.

26:26.539 --> 26:29.272
I am a big believer in the buddy system.

26:29.274 --> 26:31.074
And you are not leaving me out here alone.

26:31.076 --> 26:35.178
Why am I letting some
guy make me doubt myself?

26:35.180 --> 26:37.380
I don't know. Yes, he's a warrior.

26:37.382 --> 26:39.749
But I'm strong, I have skills.

26:39.751 --> 26:42.085
I could tear his throat out.

26:42.087 --> 26:43.787
We don't need validation from men.

26:43.789 --> 26:46.022
Uh-uh. Or anyone else.

26:46.024 --> 26:48.358
You're right.

26:49.427 --> 26:51.394
Hurry up.

26:51.396 --> 26:54.864
I have to get you back to
the Sector before curfew.

26:54.866 --> 26:56.533
Did it hurt?

26:56.535 --> 26:58.601
Getting your marks removed?

26:58.603 --> 27:00.637
Nothing will ever hurt worse.

27:00.639 --> 27:02.172
Why'd you do it?

27:02.174 --> 27:04.507
A Trag does what needs to be done.

27:15.452 --> 27:17.220

Beaumont was a traitor when he was alive.

38:12.873 --> 38:16.609
All our people are protected and cared for.

38:16.611 --> 38:19.779
Your son will have everything he needs.

38:28.522 --> 38:32.625
(softly): I am always thinking about you.

38:41.368 --> 38:43.102
(sighs)

38:43.104 --> 38:45.638
I love you, baby.

38:45.640 --> 38:47.306
Always remember that.

38:47.308 --> 38:49.308
Swear to keep this place secret.

38:49.310 --> 38:51.343
No human can know about it.

38:51.345 --> 38:53.212
Eljida and your son's life

38:53.214 --> 38:55.381
depend on it.

38:55.383 --> 38:59.518
BOY (crying): Mommy... I want Mommy.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.521
(boat motor chugging)

39:02.523 --> 39:05.023
BOY (voice fading): I want Mommy...

39:33.453 --> 39:36.021
You'll see your mother again.

39:36.023 --> 39:38.523
I really believe that.

39:38.525 --> 39:41.259
After today, I do, too.

39:41.261 --> 39:42.861
How do you think that'll make her feel,

39:42.863 --> 39:45.096
knowing her son is a Trag?

39:45.998 --> 39:47.898
Whatever you think you're looking for,

39:47.900 --> 39:50.702
- joining the Trags is not the answer.
- And what is?

39:50.704 --> 39:53.972
Hm? Your father's dream of integration?

39:53.974 --> 39:56.207
Forgive me if I'm not more grateful

39:56.209 --> 39:58.043
<i>for a few hours of freedom.</i>

39:58.045 --> 40:00.445
I don't know what my father's
dream was anymore, but I do know

40:00.447 --> 40:02.681
that I can't let what he
wanted dictate my path.

40:02.683 --> 40:06.751
We have gotten a taste of freedom, Drake.

40:06.753 --> 40:08.920
<i>We get to choose where that leads us,</i>

40:08.922 --> 40:10.588
not my father, not the Trags.

40:10.590 --> 40:12.223
Maybe there is a better way

40:12.225 --> 40:14.626
to achieve integration;
maybe you and I can find that.

40:14.628 --> 40:17.495
You know, for the first time,

40:17.497 --> 40:21.099
<i>you are the one that's unsure
about which road to take,</i>

40:21.101 --> 40:24.435
but I've never been more certain
about anything in my life.

40:24.437 --> 40:26.471
So give integration your best shot.

40:26.473 --> 40:27.739
Make it work.

40:27.741 --> 40:29.407
Give us freedom.

40:29.409 --> 40:30.808
'Cause if you don't,

40:30.810 --> 40:33.177
I won't just join the war...

40:33.179 --> 40:35.046
I'll lead the charge.
