Wahey!
CHILDREN CHEERING

00:07.781 --> 00:11.621
♪ Oh...I do like to
be beside the seaside... ♪

00:11.621 --> 00:13.261
Judy?

00:13.261 --> 00:15.901
Hey, hey... Oh, there you are!
Now, look after the baby.

00:15.901 --> 00:17.861
I tell you what, teach him to walk.

00:17.861 --> 00:20.301
He's not very good at walking yet,
you see, boys and girls.

00:20.301 --> 00:23.421
CHILDREN: Oh! So, that'll keep them
both out of mischief, won't it?

00:23.421 --> 00:24.941
All right, you, get on with it.

00:24.941 --> 00:27.701
MR PUNCH MUTTERS

00:27.701 --> 00:30.061
Left, right! Left, right!
Left, right! Left, right!

LAUGHTER

00:31.221 --> 00:33.381
Whey!
APPLAUSE

00:33.381 --> 00:35.101
Oh, what a clever boy!

00:36.621 --> 00:38.661
As the new mayor of this town,

00:38.661 --> 00:40.621
I have a very wide remit,

00:40.621 --> 00:45.141
but one of my pet hates is
enviro-crime -

00:45.141 --> 00:51.021
namely, fly-tipping, vandalism
and litter.

00:51.021 --> 00:56.381
On-the-spot fines of up to ã100 have
been introduced for anyone

00:56.381 --> 01:00.541
failing to dispose of their litter
in an appropriate fashion.

01:00.541 --> 01:04.501
And what's more,
I will be leading the way.

01:04.501 --> 01:05.621
Alan...

01:11.261 --> 01:15.741
Let's be proud of this
beautiful town of ours.

01:15.741 --> 01:21.341
After all, it is Lighthaven,
not Litterhaven.

01:22.781 --> 01:25.141
FROM STAGE: Ow! Oh!

01:26.741 --> 01:28.221
Get off!

01:28.221 --> 01:31.661
Oh! Oh! You wicked...

01:31.661 --> 01:33.621
Excuse me...

01:33.621 --> 01:36.821
Oh! Get off! Get off!

01:36.821 --> 01:40.301
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen,
the performance has been cancelled.

01:40.301 --> 01:42.621
CHILDREN: Boo!
Sorry, stop it!

01:42.621 --> 01:44.901
If you give your details to my
assistant, Alan,

01:44.901 --> 01:46.581
I'm sure you'll get a full refund.

01:46.581 --> 01:49.261
What...what are you doing?!
CHILD CRIES

01:49.261 --> 01:50.381
My job.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.541
Your job, is it, to make
children cry?

01:52.541 --> 01:54.461
I hope you're proud of yourself!

01:54.461 --> 01:56.101
SHE GRUNTS

02:00.581 --> 02:02.741
No, no pictures. Alan, Alan...

02:39.181 --> 02:41.821
Madam Mayor...Jane Kennedy, coroner.

02:41.821 --> 02:43.781
How can I help?

02:43.781 --> 02:48.421
Er...I believe you closed down Harry
Putman's show yesterday afternoon.

02:48.421 --> 02:49.821
What exactly did you say to him?

02:49.821 --> 02:50.981
Not a great deal.

02:50.981 --> 02:52.741
There wasn't a lot to say.

02:52.741 --> 02:55.261
He knew he didn't have a leg
to stand on.

02:55.261 --> 02:56.301
Excuse me?

02:56.301 --> 02:59.341
On many an occasion,
I've asked Mr Putman -

02:59.341 --> 03:03.421
Harry, as you call him - to update
his act.

03:03.421 --> 03:05.381
I explained to him that Mr Punch
doesn't need

03:05.381 --> 03:08.261
to beat his wife with a stick,

03:08.261 --> 03:09.701
but he just wouldn't listen.

03:09.701 --> 03:12.501
But did you spell it out to him
that if he failed to comply,

03:12.501 --> 03:14.221
you would put him out of business?

03:14.221 --> 03:17.701
Let's not get this
out of perspective.

03:17.701 --> 03:21.821
Revoking the wretched man's ability
to perform in Lighthaven

03:21.821 --> 03:23.901
was hardly going to put him
out of business.

03:23.901 --> 03:25.341
I'll take that as a no then.

03:25.341 --> 03:27.101
There are resorts up and down
the country

03:27.101 --> 03:29.221
that would have welcomed him
with open arms.

03:29.221 --> 03:30.981
Nonetheless, Harry lived here.

03:30.981 --> 03:32.221
This was his home.

03:32.221 --> 03:33.941
It's my home too, Ms Kennedy.

03:35.301 --> 03:36.501
I believe in this town.

03:37.461 --> 03:38.901
I have big plans for its future.

03:39.861 --> 03:43.701
But any show that invites children
to laugh at domestic abuse

03:43.701 --> 03:45.541
belongs firmly in the past.

03:47.101 --> 03:49.821
Now...if you will excuse me,

03:49.821 --> 03:53.621
I have to meet my daughter
in...precisely two minutes.

03:58.141 --> 04:01.141
I'm aware that in a conservative
town like ours,

04:01.141 --> 04:03.341
people are bound to take sides.

04:03.341 --> 04:07.821
Mr Putman has been the Punch & Judy
man in this town for 40 years.

04:07.821 --> 04:10.661
I've only been mayor for,
what...two months?

04:10.661 --> 04:12.621
Quite an achievement, though.

04:12.621 --> 04:14.421
Thank you.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.021
I was talking about Mr Putman.

04:17.261 --> 04:20.221
May I ask you something?
Can I stop you?

04:20.221 --> 04:22.461
Of all the things in this town
that need changing,

04:22.461 --> 04:24.461
why focus on Punch & Judy?

04:24.461 --> 04:25.621
Happy now, are you?!

04:26.861 --> 04:29.701
Now you've hounded an old
man to his death!

04:29.701 --> 04:33.621
Go away, before I have you
reported for drinking in public.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.701
You practically murdered Harry!

04:35.701 --> 04:39.261
Stamped him out like
he was some kind of bug!

04:39.261 --> 04:41.781
Well, you better watch out,
Your Worship,

04:41.781 --> 04:45.461
cos one of these days,
someone might stamp on you!

04:47.701 --> 04:48.741
Alan...

04:50.421 --> 04:52.901
Get off me, you idiot!

04:52.901 --> 04:55.101
I see your mum's causing
trouble again.

04:55.101 --> 04:56.301
So, what else is new?

04:57.781 --> 04:58.981
See you next weekend, Dad.

04:58.981 --> 05:00.701
Yeah. Take care, sweetheart...

05:07.501 --> 05:09.021
Friend of yours?

05:09.021 --> 05:10.261
My husband.

05:11.661 --> 05:13.341
We're separated,

05:13.341 --> 05:15.341
not that it's any of your business.

05:16.461 --> 05:17.821
What was that all about?

05:17.821 --> 05:20.501
Oh, just a drunk. Ignore him.

05:22.421 --> 05:23.461
You're late.

05:24.661 --> 05:28.301
Madam Mayor, you still haven't
answered my question.

05:33.781 --> 05:35.861
Drink this. It'll help sober you up.

05:40.821 --> 05:43.901
I see you're looking after
Harry's props.

05:43.901 --> 05:46.741
Yeah, his son asked me to find
a good home for them.

05:46.741 --> 05:48.621
Were you and Harry close?

05:49.941 --> 05:51.301
We looked out for each other.

05:52.461 --> 05:54.061
He was good for business.

05:54.061 --> 05:57.221
See...as long as there's
Punch & Judy,

05:57.221 --> 05:59.621
there'll always be
a need for deckchairs.

06:01.581 --> 06:03.581
In your opinion, do you
think it's conceivable

06:03.581 --> 06:05.181
he could have taken his own life?

06:05.181 --> 06:07.901
No. Not a chance.
He wasn't that type.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.461
I'm not saying that he wasn't fed
up. Who wouldn't be?

06:10.461 --> 06:14.461
A lifetime of entertaining people,
only to be nobbled by some

06:14.461 --> 06:18.741
jumped-up busybody who hasn't
been in the job for five minutes!

06:18.741 --> 06:19.821
Are you still at it?

06:19.821 --> 06:22.941
I've received a complaint
about you, John.

06:22.941 --> 06:24.581
Drunk and disorderly.

06:24.581 --> 06:27.821
Not to mention, behaviour likely to
cause a breach of the peace.

06:27.821 --> 06:30.581
So, arrest me.
It'll be just like old times.

06:30.581 --> 06:34.021
I'd rather you sobered up and
stopped threatening public figures.

06:34.021 --> 06:36.701
All right, I'll do my best,
Davey boy.

06:36.701 --> 06:38.061
Glad to hear it.

06:38.061 --> 06:39.901
Thanks for your time, Mr Holland.

06:39.901 --> 06:41.421
That's all right, my love.

06:56.581 --> 06:57.621
Thanks.

07:13.701 --> 07:15.461
Maybe I should introduce myself.

07:15.461 --> 07:17.741
My name's Hannah and I've got
reason to believe that,

07:17.741 --> 07:20.181
18 years ago, you gave birth to me.

07:20.181 --> 07:22.501
Darling, I'm sorry
if you feel neglected

07:22.501 --> 07:25.861
but...I've got a lot to do
and only a year to do it in.

07:25.861 --> 07:28.701
Only last night, Councillor Jeffries
assured me,

07:28.701 --> 07:30.381
and he was being perfectly serious,

07:30.381 --> 07:33.501
that we don't need a Pride Festival
here in Lighthaven.

07:33.501 --> 07:36.741
So, that's who you were with until
four in the morning,
Councillor Jeffries.

07:39.141 --> 07:41.141
Well...I'm here now.

07:41.141 --> 07:44.821
So...let's make the most of it,
shall we?

07:44.821 --> 07:46.821
I thought we could try that
new wine bar later.

07:46.821 --> 07:48.661
All cocktails are half price.

07:48.661 --> 07:51.861
Hannah, darling, I can't.
I've got a meeting this evening.

07:51.861 --> 07:54.621
Well, can't you cancel it?
I thought we could catch up.

07:54.621 --> 07:56.381
Sorry, darling.

07:56.381 --> 07:58.021
Urgent council business.

08:06.341 --> 08:07.701
Give it to me, Your Worship...

08:07.701 --> 08:09.061
MAYOR LAUGHS

08:09.061 --> 08:10.301
Oh!

08:10.301 --> 08:11.581
SHE LAUGHS

08:13.781 --> 08:16.061
Oh... Oh-ho-ho...

08:17.221 --> 08:18.421
SHE LAUGHS

08:20.821 --> 08:23.341
THEY MOAN

08:25.941 --> 08:27.821
SHE MOANS

08:27.821 --> 08:29.221
SHE LAUGHS

08:45.061 --> 08:46.381
Hi, it's me.

08:47.621 --> 08:50.221
Um...just wondering where you are.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.141
Hope all's well.

08:54.381 --> 08:56.261
Give me a call when you get this.

09:07.821 --> 09:10.221
People get the wrong
idea about Mr Punch.

09:11.461 --> 09:12.581
He's not a bully.

09:13.621 --> 09:14.861
He's a freedom fighter...

09:16.541 --> 09:17.861
..battling oppression.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.781
The real bullies are his wife
and the constable.

09:23.861 --> 09:26.461
Oh, yeah? Then how come he throws out
the baby?

09:27.621 --> 09:29.141
That's an accident.

09:29.141 --> 09:30.341
It doesn't count.

09:31.581 --> 09:34.381
Not sure the mothers down the
women's refuge would see it that way.

09:34.381 --> 09:35.541
PHONE RINGS

09:35.541 --> 09:37.181
Oh, damn...

09:37.181 --> 09:38.341
Don't answer it.

09:38.341 --> 09:40.741
It's Davey. It might be important.

09:40.741 --> 09:41.781
Hello?

09:42.741 --> 09:43.981
Yes, I know who this is.

09:46.501 --> 09:47.901
OK. I'll be there in ten minutes.

09:47.901 --> 09:50.021
What's happened?

09:50.021 --> 09:52.461
They found a body at the Grand Hotel.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.861
Keep an eye on the curry.

10:03.901 --> 10:05.941
Any ID on the deceased?

10:05.941 --> 10:08.661
Oh, didn't I mention that?
Mention what?

10:08.661 --> 10:10.701
It's the mayor. Our mayor?

10:10.701 --> 10:12.661
The mayor I was talking to
this afternoon?

10:12.661 --> 10:15.181
Yeah...I think it's fair to say
she's no longer in office.

10:16.581 --> 10:18.261
Are we sure it's her?

10:18.261 --> 10:19.821
Yeah, positive.

10:19.821 --> 10:21.661
Looks like Mr Punch got his own
back.

10:21.661 --> 10:23.461
I was just thinking the same thing.

10:24.661 --> 10:27.541
We think the murder weapon was
a champagne bottle.

10:27.541 --> 10:30.501
It seems Una and Danny Ball had
themselves a little party.

10:30.501 --> 10:32.181
Who's Danny Ball?

10:32.181 --> 10:34.261
He's the hotel's resident crooner.

10:34.261 --> 10:36.101
It was a regular thing, apparently.

10:37.341 --> 10:38.541
Yeah...

10:38.541 --> 10:41.901
This is the 999 message
she tried to make at 7.18.

10:43.981 --> 10:46.461
MAYOR CRYING

10:46.461 --> 10:49.101
And by the time we'd traced the
call,

10:49.101 --> 10:51.061
the body had already been found.

10:51.061 --> 10:53.261
Where's this singer?
I need to talk to him.

10:53.261 --> 10:54.501
No, you don't.

10:54.501 --> 10:56.301
You need to get in line.

10:56.301 --> 10:57.621
It's a murder inquiry.

11:12.181 --> 11:13.901
Do you need a moment, Mr Drake? No.

11:15.421 --> 11:16.541
No, that's her.

11:18.381 --> 11:19.941
That's my girl.

11:22.461 --> 11:24.181
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.

11:25.381 --> 11:26.781
Are you all right? OK...

11:34.621 --> 11:37.741
You say she was
found at the Grand Hotel?

11:37.741 --> 11:40.621
Er...yeah, that's correct.

11:40.621 --> 11:44.301
I don't understand. Una
lives in town with my daughter.

11:44.301 --> 11:46.101
Why would she want a hotel room?

11:47.901 --> 11:49.901
I'm afraid I can't disclose
that information.

11:51.741 --> 11:52.861
Ah...

11:53.901 --> 11:54.941
I'm sorry.

11:55.981 --> 11:58.621
Well, at least I know why
she stood me up.

12:00.181 --> 12:01.221
I'm sorry?

12:02.181 --> 12:05.141
Una and I were supposed to be
having dinner together last night.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.021
That would explain the messages you
left on your wife's voicemail.

12:10.141 --> 12:11.941
Can I ask which restaurant it was?

12:13.261 --> 12:14.381
The Handsome Crab.

12:15.861 --> 12:17.661
And what time did you get there?

12:19.861 --> 12:22.141
Um...about 6:55.

12:23.541 --> 12:25.581
And who booked the table? Una.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.741
And what time did you leave,
roughly?

12:32.821 --> 12:35.021
Ten past eight...
There or thereabouts.

12:36.181 --> 12:37.421
Right. Much obliged.

12:40.621 --> 12:43.101
A family liaison officer
will be in touch with you.

12:43.101 --> 12:46.701
And I'll... I'll let you know as
soon as we have any news.

12:46.701 --> 12:48.461
I'm sorry, Mr Drake.

12:50.221 --> 12:54.101
Actually, I was wondering
if you'd mind coming over some time,

12:54.101 --> 12:56.301
to talk to Hannah about what
happened?

12:56.301 --> 12:58.061
Not at all. I'd be happy to.

13:00.341 --> 13:03.061
Maybe...I'm old-fashioned but I...

13:03.061 --> 13:05.341
I think some things are better
coming from a woman.

13:06.941 --> 13:08.261
I'll give you a minute.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.061
Danny Ball.

13:17.061 --> 13:19.981
And what exactly was the nature
of your relationship with the mayor?

13:21.181 --> 13:22.381
NSA.

13:23.421 --> 13:25.061
As in the National Sheep
Association?

13:26.181 --> 13:28.421
As in No Strings Attached.

13:28.421 --> 13:30.141
Did she pay you?

13:30.141 --> 13:31.621
What do you take me for?

13:31.621 --> 13:33.421
Well, I'd have thought
that was obvious.

13:35.741 --> 13:38.781
THEY WHISPER

13:38.781 --> 13:41.301
Looks like we've replaced
Punch & Judy with The Sooty Show.

13:42.581 --> 13:45.301
No. She didn't pay me.

13:45.301 --> 13:46.541
Oh...

13:46.541 --> 13:49.901
A witness in the next room said they
heard a woman yelling.

13:49.901 --> 13:51.261
Would you care to comment?

13:51.261 --> 13:52.941
In the heat of the moment,

13:52.941 --> 13:57.821
Una tended to get quite vocal...if
you catch my drift.

14:00.501 --> 14:04.341
And at...6:55,
when you left the room...

14:06.221 --> 14:07.621
..how did Ms Drake seem?

14:08.821 --> 14:10.021
Just happy.

14:11.301 --> 14:12.341
Just...relaxed.

14:13.981 --> 14:15.421
I'd even say grateful.

14:20.181 --> 14:21.661
Well, his alibi checks out.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.141
He was on stage at the time.

14:23.141 --> 14:25.861
No blood on his clothes or his body.
No previous.

14:25.861 --> 14:29.061
Wanted for crimes against music
but that's about it.

14:29.061 --> 14:30.301
Don't like him, then?

14:30.301 --> 14:32.781
Never trust a man whose hair
looks like a wig.

14:32.781 --> 14:34.701
Do you think Una
was in love with him?

14:34.701 --> 14:36.501
Doubt it.

14:36.501 --> 14:38.221
She was just using him for sex.

14:39.621 --> 14:41.461
All pretty sordid, if you ask me.

14:41.461 --> 14:42.941
What? Because she's a woman?

14:42.941 --> 14:45.621
No, cos she's set herself up as
the guardian of public morals.

14:45.621 --> 14:47.301
I mean, talk about double standards.

14:47.301 --> 14:49.261
What about your double standards? Eh?

14:49.261 --> 14:52.021
A man uses a woman for sex, all his
mates pat him on the back.

14:52.021 --> 14:54.381
A woman behaves the same way
and suddenly it's sordid.

14:54.381 --> 14:58.141
Blimey, you're even beginning to
sound like the mayor. I don't know
why this bothers you.

14:58.141 --> 14:59.901
It's police business.

14:59.901 --> 15:01.021
Yes, but...

15:01.021 --> 15:03.621
Una's death may be linked
to my ongoing investigation

15:03.621 --> 15:06.061
into old Harry's drowning.

15:06.061 --> 15:08.181
Hey, I told you about this before.

15:08.181 --> 15:09.701
The coconut ones are mine.

15:11.381 --> 15:13.381
Sorry. Sorry.

15:14.701 --> 15:16.061
Calamity...

15:49.581 --> 15:50.941
Thanks for coming.

15:50.941 --> 15:52.381
Hannah's in the kitchen. OK.

16:00.301 --> 16:03.261
Dad would never hear a bad
word said about her.

16:03.261 --> 16:05.061
Not even when she walked out on him.

16:05.061 --> 16:06.101
When was that?

16:07.101 --> 16:08.821
About 18 months ago.

16:08.821 --> 16:10.661
Just after she got
elected to the council.

16:11.861 --> 16:15.181
Dad acted like it was his fault for
not being interesting enough but...

16:15.181 --> 16:16.781
that's him all over.

16:17.781 --> 16:20.181
Well...as marriage splits go,

16:20.181 --> 16:21.981
it all sounds fairly amicable.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.581
I guess.

16:23.581 --> 16:25.901
I wasn't around much at the time.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.821
I'd just turned 16 -
too busy partying.

16:29.581 --> 16:33.461
I think they drifted apart
because Mum was ambitious

16:33.461 --> 16:36.221
and Dad, well, prefers the simple
life.

16:37.821 --> 16:41.661
His idea of success is winning a
prize at the annual apple festival.

16:44.541 --> 16:46.501
I loved her, don't get me wrong,
but...

16:47.981 --> 16:50.141
..you met her.

16:50.141 --> 16:51.781
You must have seen what
she was like.

16:55.501 --> 16:58.501
Hannah, apart from the
Punch & Judy man,

16:58.501 --> 17:00.141
did your mum have any other enemies?

17:01.221 --> 17:02.701
Hundreds.

17:11.421 --> 17:13.101
Right, John...there you go.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.421
No charge.

17:17.741 --> 17:22.340
So...yesterday evening, between
seven and eight, where were you?

17:22.340 --> 17:24.221
Er...drunk.

17:24.221 --> 17:26.461
Drunk is not a location.

17:26.461 --> 17:28.941
It is when you're as drunk as I was!

17:28.941 --> 17:31.781
John, either you start taking this
seriously or I'm going to charge

17:31.781 --> 17:34.221
you with obstruction and make the
rest up as I go along.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.621
Take what seriously?

17:35.621 --> 17:37.741
I don't even know what I'm
supposed to have done!

17:37.741 --> 17:40.261
No-one's accusing
you of anything...yet.

17:40.261 --> 17:42.461
Despite the fact that you're
a known offender

17:42.461 --> 17:44.021
with a history of violent assaults,

17:44.021 --> 17:47.221
and yesterday afternoon,
you threatened the mayor
in front of witnesses.

17:47.221 --> 17:50.221
Yeah, well, she had that coming.
Well, someone obviously thought so,

17:50.221 --> 17:52.981
because shortly after your little
outburst, she was found dead.

17:54.781 --> 17:55.941
This is a joke, right?

17:56.901 --> 17:58.101
Do you see me laughing?

17:58.101 --> 17:59.621
Yes! Oh, yes!

17:59.621 --> 18:01.101
Oh, there is a God! Yes!

18:01.101 --> 18:02.941
John... All right, John, John,
sit down.

18:05.381 --> 18:06.941
Now, where were you?

18:06.941 --> 18:08.621
I can't remember!

18:08.621 --> 18:12.261
All I can tell you is, I woke up in
my hut at seven o'clock this morning

18:12.261 --> 18:15.701
with the worst hangover I've
had in years...but, eh,

18:15.701 --> 18:16.981
it's not all bad news.

18:16.981 --> 18:20.701
The Wicked Witch is dead!
That's karma, that's what that is!

18:20.701 --> 18:21.741
All right...

18:23.261 --> 18:24.981
On your way.

18:24.981 --> 18:26.501
HE LAUGHS

18:30.421 --> 18:31.861

We're now going to take a short
break but...don't go anywhere.

19:41.941 --> 19:43.101
Mr Ball.

19:43.101 --> 19:45.501
I was wondering if you'd mind
answering a few questions?

19:45.501 --> 19:46.541
Oh...

19:46.541 --> 19:50.141
Officer, please...I've already
spoken to you guys.

19:50.141 --> 19:51.541
I'm not the police.

19:51.541 --> 19:52.941
Jane Kennedy, coroner.

19:55.461 --> 19:57.101
Then we'd best have a drink.

19:59.661 --> 20:02.341
I'm investigating
the death of Harold Putman.

20:03.381 --> 20:04.541
The Punch & Judy man?

20:06.141 --> 20:09.261
Oh, yeah.
Una was a bit upset about that.

20:09.261 --> 20:10.581
Oh?

20:10.581 --> 20:12.981
Yeah. She thought it might
damage her popularity.

20:14.261 --> 20:16.381
All heart, was old Una.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.661
You obviously liked her. Yeah...

20:22.341 --> 20:26.781
Mmm...I just wish me and Una had
parted on better terms, that's all.

20:26.781 --> 20:29.061
Was there some sort of disagreement?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.821
Hmm, more like a blazing row.

20:32.181 --> 20:34.141
About the Punch & Judy man?

20:34.141 --> 20:35.781
About my career.

20:35.781 --> 20:38.701
I've had this great idea
for an album, see...

20:38.701 --> 20:40.901
Having A Ball With Danny Ball.

20:40.901 --> 20:44.701
But, I just need a backer to
pay for some studio time.

20:44.701 --> 20:45.821
And you asked Una?

20:45.821 --> 20:48.461
Mmm...even bought her a bottle of
bubbly to sweeten her up.

20:48.461 --> 20:50.301
And guess what she told me.

20:50.301 --> 20:53.901
That it'd be a waste of money cos
I'm not much of a singer.

20:53.901 --> 20:57.061
That...if I had what it takes,
I would've made it by now!

20:57.061 --> 20:58.501
And what did you say?

20:58.501 --> 20:59.821
Well, I went ballistic.

21:00.821 --> 21:02.021
I mean, you've heard me...

21:03.221 --> 21:04.941
Would you say I've got a voice?

21:06.181 --> 21:08.901
Oh, yeah...it's definitely a voice.

21:10.821 --> 21:13.461
Well...thanks for your time,
Mr Ball.

21:14.581 --> 21:17.261
You know, for your age...

21:19.021 --> 21:21.021
..you really are a fine-looking
lady.

21:23.021 --> 21:25.341
Has anyone ever told you
that before?

21:25.341 --> 21:27.861
Funnily enough, just men like you.

21:49.581 --> 21:51.661
As bad as that, is it? Hey.

21:53.181 --> 21:54.341
Yeah...

21:56.061 --> 21:58.981
I don't think the deckchair
man's got anything to do with it.

21:58.981 --> 22:01.421
The fact that he hated the mayor
is not enough to hold him.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.181
I may as well arrest myself.

22:03.181 --> 22:05.021
And Gavin Drake's alibi is
rock solid -

22:05.021 --> 22:07.701
he was in a restaurant
the whole time.

22:07.701 --> 22:10.021
He could have arranged
for someone else to kill Una.

22:10.021 --> 22:13.101
Yeah, I did think of that so I ran
a check on the Drakes' finances

22:13.101 --> 22:16.181
to see if Gavin had anything to
gain from his wife's death but...

22:16.181 --> 22:17.821
it turns out the house, the farm,

22:17.821 --> 22:20.381
everything that went
with it was in his name.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.981
When Una left,
she wouldn't take a penny from him.

22:22.981 --> 22:24.101
A proud woman.

22:24.101 --> 22:25.781
Yeah, a very annoying woman.

22:25.781 --> 22:28.061
As unhelpful in death as she was
in life.

22:28.061 --> 22:29.821
No joy from forensics? No...

22:31.021 --> 22:33.581
The only DNA on the champagne
bottle belonged to the victim.

22:35.061 --> 22:38.461
Well, if it's any consolation, Danny
Ball has been hiding something.

22:38.461 --> 22:40.861
Yeah, what's that?
It really is a wig?

22:42.661 --> 22:47.101
He and Una, they had a blazing row
just before she was killed.

22:57.301 --> 22:59.341
All right, I love you!

22:59.341 --> 23:00.501
CAR ACCELERATES

23:00.501 --> 23:01.901
TYRES SCREECH

23:01.901 --> 23:03.541
HE SCREAMS

23:08.381 --> 23:10.701
POLICE SIREN BLARES

23:15.621 --> 23:17.581
Let's step you out of the car!

23:17.581 --> 23:18.901
Get off me!

23:18.901 --> 23:20.741
You should be arresting him, not me!

23:20.741 --> 23:22.701
He killed my mother!
You're a murderer!

23:22.701 --> 23:24.381
Easy, easy, easy.

23:24.381 --> 23:26.461
Right, you're under arrest.
Do you understand?

23:28.621 --> 23:30.221
Why did you run him over?

23:30.221 --> 23:31.261
I didn't.

23:31.261 --> 23:32.861
He stepped in front of my car.

23:32.861 --> 23:35.621
Oh, you just happened to be driving
through the hotel car park

23:35.621 --> 23:36.661
and there he was?

23:38.581 --> 23:41.141
Now, your mum kept her relationship
with Mr Ball under wraps

23:41.141 --> 23:43.741
and we've been careful not to
release his name to the public,

23:43.741 --> 23:46.261
so why would you even be
aware of his existence?

23:46.261 --> 23:47.501
Why don't you ask him?

23:48.541 --> 23:51.301
Because I'd rather hear it from you.

23:51.301 --> 23:52.341
DANNY GROANS

23:52.341 --> 23:54.661
Why did the mayor's
daughter attack you?

23:54.661 --> 23:58.301
Oh, is that who it was? Danny...

23:58.301 --> 24:02.021
If you persist in lying, you're only
going to get yourself in deeper and
deeper trouble.

24:02.021 --> 24:04.941
I haven't lied - not exactly.

24:06.381 --> 24:08.141
Just haven't told the truth,
that's all.

24:09.461 --> 24:12.621
More to the point, what has any
of this got to do with Punch & Judy?

24:12.621 --> 24:14.021
I don't know yet.

24:14.021 --> 24:16.781
I dated Hannah last Christmas.

24:16.781 --> 24:21.301
Nice girl,
but a bit too keen for my liking.

24:21.301 --> 24:24.901
We'd only known each other a week
and she invited me for Sunday lunch.

24:24.901 --> 24:26.541
Is that when you first met Una?

24:26.541 --> 24:27.781
HE LAUGHS
Yeah...

24:29.061 --> 24:30.581
It was lust at first sight.

24:32.341 --> 24:34.581
I ended it with Hannah
the very next day.

24:36.261 --> 24:37.381
Yes, please, Nurse.

24:42.421 --> 24:43.581
Thank you.

24:43.581 --> 24:44.901
You were saying?

24:46.101 --> 24:49.301
A few days later, her mum turned
up at the hotel...

24:50.381 --> 24:51.741
Told me she wanted me.

24:52.981 --> 24:55.741
Her sole condition being that Hannah
must never find out.

24:59.661 --> 25:01.341
God, what a mess.

25:03.341 --> 25:05.541
What am I going to do now?

25:05.541 --> 25:07.701
You're worried Hannah will
incriminate you?

25:07.701 --> 25:10.061
No. No!

25:10.061 --> 25:12.781
I mean, what are my fans going to
say when they see me like this?

25:14.261 --> 25:15.981
Goodbye, Danny.

25:15.981 --> 25:17.741
HE INHALES

25:19.301 --> 25:21.061
I'm going to ask you again.

25:21.061 --> 25:22.221
How did you find out?

25:28.181 --> 25:31.061
A friend from college said
she'd seen Mum and Danny

25:31.061 --> 25:32.621
together in the hotel bar.

25:34.981 --> 25:36.221
I didn't believe her.

25:37.581 --> 25:39.781
So, I checked Mum's phone
when she was in the shower.

25:41.261 --> 25:42.901
And there were the texts,

25:42.901 --> 25:45.261
all the things she wanted to
do to him

25:45.261 --> 25:47.461
and all the things
he wanted to do to her.

25:49.261 --> 25:50.301
I'm sorry.

25:53.501 --> 25:55.021
Did you challenge her about it?

25:55.021 --> 25:56.701
I was going to...

25:56.701 --> 25:57.941
on the night she died.

25:59.581 --> 26:01.541
But she made an excuse.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.021
Went off to see Danny instead.

26:03.021 --> 26:06.261
So, you felt like she had betrayed
you? She DID betray me.

26:06.261 --> 26:09.581
You hated her. You wanted her dead.
Is that what you're telling me,
Hannah?

26:11.821 --> 26:13.261
Yeah.

26:13.261 --> 26:14.661
You admit it, then?

26:14.661 --> 26:16.381
I just said so, didn't I? Good.

26:17.541 --> 26:19.861
Now we're getting somewhere.

26:19.861 --> 26:22.541
What time did you go to the hotel?

26:22.541 --> 26:24.181
I don't understand the question.

26:24.181 --> 26:27.261
Oh, come on,
don't play games with me. I'm not!

26:29.421 --> 26:31.261
All right...

26:31.261 --> 26:33.421
Well, maybe this will
jog your memory.

26:40.421 --> 26:42.941
No... No, no, no, no!

26:42.941 --> 26:44.541
Hannah! Hannah!

26:44.541 --> 26:45.901
Get some help, please. Hannah!

26:45.901 --> 26:47.741
SHE CRIES UNCONTROLLABLY

26:47.741 --> 26:50.101
ALARM SOUNDS

26:52.621 --> 26:54.901
Well, obviously she went to the
hotel.

26:54.901 --> 26:56.261
What if she didn't?

26:56.261 --> 26:59.861
If you ask me, a girl who runs her
ex-boyfriend over with a car
is capable of anything,

26:59.861 --> 27:01.901
unless you think the mayor was
murdered twice?

27:01.901 --> 27:04.061
So, listen, why don't you do us
both a favour?

27:04.061 --> 27:06.341
Go home, put your feet up,
pour a nice glass of red wine

27:06.341 --> 27:08.861
and drink to the fact that
I can and I have, just this once,

27:08.861 --> 27:11.861
managed to wrap up a murder inquiry
without your help.

27:22.821 --> 27:24.461
I know he wasn't serious but...

27:26.461 --> 27:29.261
..maybe Davey had a point.
What about?

27:32.661 --> 27:34.341
Maybe there were two killers...

27:35.701 --> 27:37.781
Two separate murder attempts.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.101
How do you reckon that?

27:41.141 --> 27:45.501
According to this, the injuries to
Una's brain were so severe,

27:45.501 --> 27:47.461
death would have been instantaneous.

27:47.461 --> 27:50.421
Instantaneous meaning she would
have had no time to make phone calls.

27:50.421 --> 27:54.181
So, surely that means
she received the head injuries

27:54.181 --> 27:55.261
after she passed out?

27:56.301 --> 27:59.941
So, what if Hannah gets the ball
rolling, puts her mum out of action?

28:01.061 --> 28:03.781
Then someone else
comes into the hotel room,

28:03.781 --> 28:06.541
sees the mayor lying there and...
But who, though?

28:09.661 --> 28:10.821
No, you're right...

28:12.341 --> 28:14.621
Without a name or a motive,
we're no further on.

28:18.541 --> 28:19.821
Funny...

28:19.821 --> 28:21.621
I never noticed that before. What?

28:23.101 --> 28:24.741
Looks like she had a nose job.

28:27.421 --> 28:28.901
Before and after.

28:30.381 --> 28:33.861
There is nothing wrong with
that nose. I agree.

28:35.221 --> 28:36.461
So, why change it?

28:36.461 --> 28:38.781
Might've got knocked out of shape.

28:38.781 --> 28:41.861
We all know she was a...pain
in the bum.

28:41.861 --> 28:43.381
Someone could have punched her.

28:45.421 --> 28:46.461
Punch...

28:54.021 --> 28:56.421
PHONE RINGS

28:58.301 --> 28:59.821
Hi...

28:59.821 --> 29:00.901
Dr Sharp?

29:00.901 --> 29:02.301
Thanks for getting back.

29:02.301 --> 29:05.381
I just wondered if there was an
update on Hannah Drake?

29:07.221 --> 29:10.141
So, she's not well enough to be
interviewed yet, no?

29:11.221 --> 29:12.941
No, no, no, it's all right.

29:12.941 --> 29:14.741
That's all I wanted to know.

29:14.741 --> 29:15.781
Thanks.

29:20.981 --> 29:23.221
Well? Looks like you were right.

29:23.221 --> 29:26.381
Una made two visits to A & E
last year.

29:26.381 --> 29:28.341
The first was in late May.

29:28.341 --> 29:33.661
"Multiple contusions to back
and shoulders caused by
a fall down stairs."

29:33.661 --> 29:36.741
Just two weeks after her
election to town council.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.821
Her next visit - 2nd June...

29:38.821 --> 29:44.341
"Broken nose and dislocated right
shoulder - patient slipped in bath."

29:44.341 --> 29:45.461
Hmm...likely story.

29:45.461 --> 29:48.741
And listen to this, the very next
day, she leaves her husband.

29:48.741 --> 29:51.261
A week later, she books
herself into a private clinic

29:51.261 --> 29:52.981
and gets a new conk.

29:54.341 --> 29:55.701
Good work. Well done.

29:55.701 --> 29:58.621
Unfortunately, it still leaves us
with a major problem.

29:58.621 --> 30:01.741
Of all the suspects, Gavin Drake is
the only one with an alibi.

30:01.741 --> 30:04.861
At the time of the murder, he was sat
here at a table booked by his wife.

30:04.861 --> 30:06.901
I wonder what made her
choose this place?

30:06.901 --> 30:09.461
Well, I'm guessing the fact
it's only a minute from the hotel

30:09.461 --> 30:11.061
had something to do with it.

30:11.061 --> 30:12.701
Plus, the food's meant to be good.

30:12.701 --> 30:16.221
Yeah! I'm surprised anyone's ever
lived long enough to find out.

30:16.221 --> 30:17.301
What do you mean?

30:17.301 --> 30:18.901
I came here with a girl once...

30:18.901 --> 30:21.141
They usually wait till I've settled
the bill

30:21.141 --> 30:23.421
before they tell me
they only want me as a friend.

30:23.421 --> 30:26.701
But that night, the service was
so bad,

30:26.701 --> 30:28.821
I got dumped before we'd
even ordered.

30:33.981 --> 30:35.381
Catch you later.

30:35.381 --> 30:37.461
Hang on, I thought you were paying?

30:39.101 --> 30:40.301
So, what does this prove?

30:40.301 --> 30:41.541
Well, it all fits.

30:41.541 --> 30:44.901
No wonder she didn't like
Punch & Judy. She was living with
a real life Mr Punch.

30:44.901 --> 30:46.741
Well, then why didn't she report it?

30:46.741 --> 30:48.781
Maybe she didn't want
to be seen as a victim.

30:48.781 --> 30:51.101
No. What you've got there is
purely circumstantial.

30:51.101 --> 30:52.821
Yes, but as you're always pointing
out,

30:52.821 --> 30:56.421
the majority of convictions are
supported on the basis of
circumstantial evidence.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.261
That doesn't even prove she was
attacked, let alone by her husband.

30:59.261 --> 31:02.941
Besides, you put Gavin Drake in the
ring with Una and my money's on
the mayor every time.

31:02.941 --> 31:06.261
Surely we should at least talk to
him? You talk to him. I'm busy.

31:06.261 --> 31:08.461
I'm finally going to get to
interview his daughter.

31:08.461 --> 31:11.661
You know, the person that actually
committed the crime.

31:19.581 --> 31:22.141
OPERA MUSIC
Hello?

31:23.341 --> 31:24.701
Hello?

31:27.261 --> 31:28.341
Gavin...

31:30.101 --> 31:31.901
God, woman... I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

31:33.661 --> 31:35.261
Don't creep up on people like that.

31:35.261 --> 31:36.781
I didn't mean to. Are you all right?

31:38.541 --> 31:40.221
You nearly gave me a heart attack.

31:40.221 --> 31:43.061
For a moment, I thought you were
Una come back to haunt me.

31:44.301 --> 31:48.301
Actually...it was Una I wanted to
talk to you about. Hmm?

31:50.061 --> 31:53.781
I know it's...none
of my business but I just...

31:53.781 --> 31:55.261
I wondered why you separated?

31:56.541 --> 31:57.661
It was a tough time.

31:59.181 --> 32:02.061
Una started putting her
career before her family.

32:03.181 --> 32:05.541
I thought I was losing her.

32:05.541 --> 32:07.741
I...panicked...

32:09.901 --> 32:12.581
Turns out I have abandonment issues.

32:12.581 --> 32:16.141
There's a therapist's phrase
if ever I heard one. Yeah...

32:16.141 --> 32:18.021
It was Una's idea.

32:18.021 --> 32:21.141
She said the marriage wasn't over,
just on hold.

32:21.141 --> 32:23.261
Promised that
if I went to counselling,

32:23.261 --> 32:26.741
sorted my head out,
there might be a way back for us.

32:26.741 --> 32:28.341
And you took her at her word.

32:29.421 --> 32:30.461
I had no choice.

32:32.181 --> 32:33.221
I loved her.

32:34.861 --> 32:36.981
Now, if you don't mind,
I'm sort of busy.

32:37.981 --> 32:39.181
Of course. Sorry.

32:40.661 --> 32:42.221
I'm sorry. That sounded rude.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.461
It's just I'm expecting my daughter
any moment.

32:44.461 --> 32:47.261
Haven't you heard? Heard what?

32:47.261 --> 32:48.941
Hannah's been arrested.

32:48.941 --> 32:50.021
Ow!

33:00.661 --> 33:02.781
How are you feeling?

33:02.781 --> 33:04.181
You're the detective.

33:04.181 --> 33:05.821
How do you think I'm feeling?

33:06.821 --> 33:10.181
Whilst the doctors were assessing
you, I did some homework.

33:11.581 --> 33:13.821
I reread the forensic
pathologist's report

33:13.821 --> 33:18.461
and I found evidence of a thing
called...laryngeal oedema.

33:18.461 --> 33:20.541
You know what that is?

33:20.541 --> 33:24.261
No? It's a well-known
symptom of anaphylactic shock.

33:26.901 --> 33:29.261
Was your mum allergic to anything,
Hannah?

33:29.261 --> 33:30.301
The truth.

33:32.661 --> 33:34.821
She was allergic to crustaceans.

33:34.821 --> 33:36.421
Crab, lobster, prawn...

33:37.501 --> 33:39.341
But I get the feeling you
already knew that.

33:39.341 --> 33:41.221
You know, you're right.

33:41.221 --> 33:45.341
So, I went back to your mum's house
and I searched your bedroom

33:45.341 --> 33:47.661
and I found these on top
of the wardrobe.

33:48.781 --> 33:51.541
I'm showing the suspect
Exhibit A and Exhibit B.

33:53.261 --> 33:55.941
Now, my guess is you took these
out of your mum's bag at the cafe

33:55.941 --> 33:58.901
at about the same time you
poisoned her food.

33:58.901 --> 34:00.061
Would that be right?

34:02.621 --> 34:04.701
Why don't you tell me what happened?

34:07.341 --> 34:11.221
Mum went to the counter to complain
that her tea was too weak.

34:11.221 --> 34:13.261
She was always complaining
about something.

34:14.741 --> 34:16.380
As soon as her back was turned,

34:16.380 --> 34:18.501
I smeared a bit of prawn
on one of her scones.

34:19.981 --> 34:21.661
And then what happened? Nothing.

34:22.860 --> 34:24.860
It wasn't likely to.
She suffered from EIA.

34:25.940 --> 34:27.021
Come again?

34:27.021 --> 34:28.900
Exercise-induced anaphylaxis.

34:31.021 --> 34:35.860
Mum could eat something that had
been contaminated and, at first,
there'd be no reaction.

34:35.860 --> 34:40.061
The choking and shortness of breath
only kicked in after exercise.

34:40.061 --> 34:43.061
And, of course, you knew she'd soon
be at that hotel...

34:44.701 --> 34:45.741
..exercising.

34:47.900 --> 34:51.661
I'm sorry. I assumed Hannah would
have called to let you know. No.

34:51.661 --> 34:55.821
I don't know any details, just that
she has admitted to killing her mum.

34:55.821 --> 34:57.141
No. It's impossible.

34:57.141 --> 34:58.981
You seem very certain.

34:58.981 --> 35:00.421
I know my own daughter, OK?

35:02.021 --> 35:04.141
They must have tricked
her, forced a confession.

35:04.141 --> 35:05.541
Hannah had nothing to do with it.

35:05.541 --> 35:07.541
I see you're still
wearing your wedding ring.

35:07.541 --> 35:09.101
What about it?

35:09.101 --> 35:10.581
No, nothing, just...

35:11.821 --> 35:13.981
When I met Una,
she wasn't wearing hers and yet...

35:15.221 --> 35:18.061
..in that photograph, taken just
24 hours previously, there it is.

35:19.301 --> 35:21.421
It's odd, don't you think?

35:21.421 --> 35:23.461
As if she deliberately removed her
wedding ring

35:23.461 --> 35:26.261
on the day that she arranged
to meet you.

35:26.261 --> 35:27.301
I can't say I noticed.

35:29.541 --> 35:31.741
Care to join me? No, I'm driving.

35:31.741 --> 35:33.061
Go on...

35:33.061 --> 35:34.781
It's my own home-made scrumpy.

35:34.781 --> 35:35.821
Lovely stuff.

35:36.941 --> 35:38.261
OK, maybe just a little.

35:44.661 --> 35:46.741
Thanks. Cheers. Cheers.

35:56.781 --> 35:57.821
OK...

35:58.941 --> 36:00.901
I'll admit I knew something
was going on.

36:02.301 --> 36:03.341
So I followed her.

36:04.501 --> 36:06.581
Stupid, I know, but...

36:06.581 --> 36:08.981
that's what jealousy
does to you...

36:08.981 --> 36:12.061
Eats away at you until you simply
have to know the worst.

36:16.901 --> 36:19.181
You do realise what
you've admitted to?

36:19.181 --> 36:20.901
She was my mum, for God's sake!

36:22.501 --> 36:24.461
She was supposed to love me
and take care of me.

36:25.861 --> 36:27.781
I thought Danny would phone
an ambulance.

36:28.941 --> 36:31.221
I didn't know he'd be on stage
when it happened.

36:31.221 --> 36:32.941
So, you didn't mean to
kill your mother?

36:34.181 --> 36:35.821
Is that what you're telling me?
Yeah.

36:35.821 --> 36:39.341
Hannah, for someone who didn't mean
to kill their mother, you did
a pretty good job.

36:39.341 --> 36:43.341
Those head injuries? They're among
the worst I've ever seen. That
wasn't me. Hannah, come on.

36:43.341 --> 36:44.381
No, look!

36:45.581 --> 36:46.941
Those pictures...

36:48.781 --> 36:50.501
I don't know who did that to her.

36:51.701 --> 36:53.941
All I know is,
I had nothing to do with it.

37:00.221 --> 37:02.541
I saw her at the hotel with that...

37:02.541 --> 37:03.941
X Factor reject.

37:05.661 --> 37:07.661
I kept my distance, didn't want to
make a scene.

37:08.861 --> 37:12.381
I thought that could wait till
dinner, when I got her all to
myself.

37:14.221 --> 37:16.621
But then she didn't even
bother to turn up.

37:19.741 --> 37:23.061
There was me thinking
she wanted to build bridges.

37:23.061 --> 37:26.341
When in fact, she was probably going
to ask you for a divorce.

37:27.821 --> 37:28.861
I know.

37:31.421 --> 37:32.621
Why couldn't I see that?

37:34.181 --> 37:35.821
Like a little kid sometimes...

37:37.221 --> 37:38.421
Too trusting.

37:40.621 --> 37:42.541
Spent a fortune in counselling.

37:43.781 --> 37:45.301
"How are we feeling today, Gavin?"

37:46.341 --> 37:48.421
All the time, she was just
stringing me along.

37:48.421 --> 37:51.261
The night it ended said it all,
me...

37:51.261 --> 37:53.821
waiting at that restaurant
like a lemon

37:53.821 --> 37:56.021
while she's living it up,
drinking cham...

37:57.701 --> 37:59.261
Drinking champagne?

38:02.061 --> 38:04.661
What makes you think
she was drinking champagne?

38:11.341 --> 38:13.141
You were in a lot of pain, Gavin.

38:17.181 --> 38:18.661
SEAGULLS CRY

38:18.661 --> 38:20.981
When she didn't show at the
restaurant, I think you...

38:22.581 --> 38:23.821
..you went to go and find her.

38:26.541 --> 38:29.221
DANNY HUMS

38:29.221 --> 38:32.421
When you got to the hotel, you
discovered the reason she'd been

Where are they, then?

39:25.541 --> 39:29.941
OK, attacking your wife is one thing.
You hurt me, that's a different
story. You know that, don't you?

39:29.941 --> 39:33.261
BREATHLESSLY: Come on, Gavin, it's
over. Put the knife down. Please
don't...

39:33.261 --> 39:34.701
You don't want to hurt me.

Are you OK? Are you OK?

Mr Drake.

40:26.301 --> 40:27.501
Hey.

40:27.501 --> 40:28.741
Clever clogs.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.581
Do you ever get
tired of being right?

40:32.581 --> 40:34.461
Especially at moments like this.

40:35.581 --> 40:37.941
What gets me is Drake
needn't have bothered.

40:37.941 --> 40:40.301
If he'd left his wife alone,
she would have died anyway!

40:40.301 --> 40:42.621
Oh, I'm glad you think it's amusing.

40:42.621 --> 40:45.061
No, it's bloody tragic.

40:45.061 --> 40:46.861
A whole family destroyed
and for what?

40:48.941 --> 40:50.581

Hello, Annette.

41:19.701 --> 41:21.781
Yeah.

Yeah, I know,
I've got to pick the car up.

Yes. What's the matter with it now?

Now, now, Punch.

41:33.141 --> 41:36.941
What's all this about you raising
your voice to Mrs Punch?

41:38.061 --> 41:40.261
I'm sorry, Officer.

41:40.261 --> 41:42.381
I don't know what came over me.

41:43.381 --> 41:48.341
Well...as long as you're willing to
attend an anger management course,

41:48.341 --> 41:52.261
we'll say no more about it.

APPLAUSE

41:53.821 --> 41:55.221

Well...I've seen old Harry's show
so many times, I know it by heart.

42:00.781 --> 42:03.541
I thought I might as well
continue the tradition.

42:03.541 --> 42:06.301
Actually, it was Harry I came to
talk to you about.

42:07.341 --> 42:09.541
We heard back from the pathologist.

42:09.541 --> 42:12.061
It looks as though Harry drank
himself into a stupor

42:12.061 --> 42:13.301
and passed out on the beach.

42:14.421 --> 42:16.341
The incoming tide did the rest.

42:18.621 --> 42:21.981
If it's any comfort, John, I don't
think he knew anything about it.

42:21.981 --> 42:24.861
The show must go on, eh?
 Oh, yeah!
