00:02.402 --> 00:04.104
( bell rings )

00:04.137 --> 00:06.705
 <i>* When I wake up in the</i>
 <i>morning and the alarm</i>
 <i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.740 --> 00:09.676
 <i>* I don't think</i>
 <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.612
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.645 --> 00:16.383
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.416 --> 00:20.487
 <i>* It's all right</i>
 <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.821 --> 00:24.858
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.891 --> 00:27.861
  <i>* And my dog ate</i>
  <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.894 --> 00:30.797
 <i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
 <i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.830 --> 00:34.534
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>

00:34.567 --> 00:38.405
 <i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.719 --> 00:55.722
   <i>* It's all right</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:58.692

00:58.725 --> 01:02.362
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:18.778 --> 01:20.847
The student council meeting
is now in session.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.850
  Zack, what's the first
  order of business?

01:23.883 --> 01:25.885
   Well, we have
   a very exciting petition

01:25.919 --> 01:28.788
signed by four nerds,
two dorks and a dweeb.

01:29.622 --> 01:31.491
I'm the dweeb.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.563
  Everybody knows that,
  Franklin.

01:38.498 --> 01:41.634
 We want Thursday to be
 an official day of mourning.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.637
  Franklin's right.
  25 years ago next Thursday,

01:44.671 --> 01:47.640
 they canceled
 "Gilligan's Island."

01:47.674 --> 01:50.010
  Somebody
  should cancel you.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.778
Any other new business?

01:51.811 --> 01:54.814
  I think Graham
  has to go to the bathroom.

01:55.515 --> 01:56.916
 Yes, Graham?

01:56.950 --> 02:00.420
  I'd like to
  introduce all of you
  to Public Enemy #1.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.622
 Hey, he's right here.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.557
 The plastic foam cup.

02:04.591 --> 02:08.461
 Every time we use one of these
 in our school we
 pollute our planet,

02:08.495 --> 02:12.065
because plastic foam cups
are not biodegradable.

02:12.065 --> 02:14.934
He's right, we need to talk
to the administration.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.772
 No, we need to stop tomorrow's
 delivery of plastic foam cups.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.508
   No one's gonna be here.
   It's "Cut Day," remember?

02:21.541 --> 02:23.076
It's the only reason
I go to school.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.645
  Zack, we need
  to save the planet.

02:25.679 --> 02:27.714
  A planet without Cut Day
  isn't worth saving.

02:27.747 --> 02:31.551
 Zack: Bravo!

02:31.584 --> 02:35.689
   All right, everybody, I have
   an important
   announcement to make.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.991
  I know that tomorrow
  is Cut Day.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.694
  - Thanks for
  reminding us, sir.
  - Stop by again next year.

02:40.727 --> 02:41.961
See ya.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.264
 Now there's nothing
 I can do to stop you,

02:44.297 --> 02:48.601
 but anyone who does cut
 will get an unexcused absence,

02:48.635 --> 02:52.906
   and... 10 unexcused absences
   means suspension.

02:52.939 --> 02:56.810
   And somebody here
   already has nine.

03:00.080 --> 03:03.216
Come on, sir.
You can't expect me
to be here on Cut Day.

03:03.249 --> 03:06.920
 Oh, yes I can.
 I'm going to check
 on you all day long.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.856
   If you're not here,
   you're suspended.

03:09.889 --> 03:12.058
   Sense of impending doom.

03:15.962 --> 03:18.064
  What do you think, Lisa?
  A little less on the sides,

03:18.098 --> 03:20.066
   maybe straighten
   my curls on top?

03:20.066 --> 03:21.801
What are you
talking about, Screech?

03:21.835 --> 03:23.737
   Well, tomorrow's Cut Day.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.940
You don't get a haircut
on Cut Day, you doofus.

03:26.973 --> 03:29.676
 You cut school
 and go to the beach.

03:29.709 --> 03:31.711
How come nobody
told me this last year?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.114
  I blew the whole day
  at the barbershop.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.349
 What?

03:36.383 --> 03:38.718
 This is going to be
 the best Cut Day ever, Mama.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.754
   First we'll start at The Max
   and after that...

03:40.787 --> 03:43.089
  Hold it, Slater. I want
  to stay in school tomorrow.

03:43.089 --> 03:45.658
 What?
 You out of your mind?

03:45.692 --> 03:48.661
  I want to
  guarantee the survival
  of the earth's environment.

03:48.695 --> 03:49.863
 Can't that wait till Monday?

03:49.896 --> 03:51.865
 There's a plastic
 foam protest tomorrow

03:51.898 --> 03:53.667
   and I intend
   to be part of it.

03:53.700 --> 03:54.901
  Oh, well. Have fun.

03:54.934 --> 03:58.371
  I'll be at the beach
  with my plastic
  foam boogie board.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.341
 - How can you be
 so irresponsible?
 - Jessie, lighten up.

04:01.374 --> 04:05.111
 Missing one protest isn't
 going to put the earth
 on the critical list.

04:05.145 --> 04:08.682
You know everything about
the environment,
except how to enjoy it.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.050
If you don't do
something about it now,

04:10.050 --> 04:13.753
there won't be
anything left to enjoy.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.589
  Graham, I thought what
  you said this
  morning was great.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.625
 Wait till you see me tomorrow,
 even if I have
 to protest alone.

04:19.659 --> 04:22.195
 Oh, you won't be alone.
 I'll be here
 protesting with you.

04:22.228 --> 04:25.131
  Really? That's great.
  Two people can
  make a difference.

04:25.165 --> 04:28.101
 All you need is a spark
 to start a fire. I'll see ya.

04:28.134 --> 04:30.136
 Okay.

04:30.170 --> 04:33.206
   While you and Graham are out
   toasting marshmallows,

04:33.239 --> 04:35.775
 I'll be having fun
 with Kelly and Zack.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.877
  Correction. Zack is going
  to be here with me.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.913
 You? Marching
 for the environment?

04:39.946 --> 04:43.983
His idea of recycling
is trading
blondes for brunettes.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.219
  No, I'm not marching,
  Slater.

04:46.252 --> 04:49.122
  Belding said if he cuts
  once more, he's suspended.

04:49.155 --> 04:52.859
   Aw. Pretty poor Preppie.
   I'll send you a postcard.

04:52.892 --> 04:55.895
 Hey, the King of Cut Day
 will find a way out.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.098
 Your folks will kill you
 if you get suspended.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.034
   Give it up, guy.
   You're spending
   Cut Day here at Bayside.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.069
   Yeah? All right.

05:03.103 --> 05:06.673
  100 bucks says
  I'll find a way out
  and spend Cut Day with you.

05:06.706 --> 05:08.041
  You're on.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.047
 All right,
 let's call the roll.

05:14.080 --> 05:15.815
Adams?

05:16.783 --> 05:18.685
  Applegate?

05:18.718 --> 05:20.153
Baker?

05:20.186 --> 05:21.955
   Barnett?

05:24.190 --> 05:25.892
  Who cares?

05:26.893 --> 05:28.828
 Where did we
 leave off yesterday?

05:28.862 --> 05:32.065
  We were discussing
  the obvious benefits of
  a female president.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.466
  She's long overdue.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.236
Yup, just like a woman.
Always late.

05:39.205 --> 05:42.942
 It's about time the
 United States caught up
 with the rest of the world.

05:42.976 --> 05:45.178
 They've had
 Margaret Thatcher in England,

05:45.211 --> 05:48.948
 Indira Gandhi in India...
 Golda Meir in Israel.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.985
   - What?
   - Oh... nothing.

05:52.085 --> 05:56.956
 I didn't know there was
 a male brain capable
 of that kind of thinking.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.825
  Excuse me, Mrs. Carpenter.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.927
  I just want to make sure
  that one of
  your students is...

06:01.027 --> 06:03.129
   Well, good morning, Zack.

06:03.163 --> 06:07.167
   Yes, that's easy
   for you to say, sir.
   They pay you to be here.

06:09.836 --> 06:13.239
 I have to go now, but I'll be
 checking on you later, Zack.

06:13.273 --> 06:16.176
 - You can count on it.
 - Zack: Okay.

06:16.209 --> 06:20.046
   - You're out 100 bucks.
   - I wouldn't be
   too sure, Jessie.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.483
  Zack Morris to the library.

06:23.516 --> 06:26.086
   You owe $86
   in overdue books

06:26.119 --> 06:30.790
  and the librarian is shouting
  in a whisper for her money.

06:30.824 --> 06:34.060
   All right, Zack.
   You'd better go.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.897
 See what happens when
 you don't cut school?
  You get in trouble.

06:39.299 --> 06:41.267
  Screech: Come on, 'gator.
  You're mine!

06:41.301 --> 06:43.570
 - Take that and that!
 - Let me have a turn!

06:43.603 --> 06:45.839
 This is a man's job, Lisa.
 Take that!

06:45.872 --> 06:47.807
  Back in your swamp!

06:47.841 --> 06:50.377
   - ( game beeps )
   - I got 'em all.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.245
  No, you missed one.

06:52.278 --> 06:53.847
  Ow.

06:55.882 --> 06:58.918
 I don't think you
 understand the rules.

06:58.952 --> 07:02.022
  Now just let the stick
  slide through
  your fingers, okay?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.024
  Keep it straight
  and follow through.

07:04.024 --> 07:05.558
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

07:05.592 --> 07:08.028
 - You got it.
 - Bull's-eye!

07:08.061 --> 07:09.863
 You're a terrific teacher,
 Slater.

07:09.896 --> 07:11.898
  You and Jessie
  must have a blast together.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.067
 You kidding?
 I tried to
 teach her horseshoes

07:14.100 --> 07:16.302
  and she said it was
  cruelty to animals.

07:16.336 --> 07:19.873
 - Come on, let's try this one.
 - Okay.

07:19.906 --> 07:21.107
   You want to take a turn?

07:21.141 --> 07:24.110
  Oh, no. That's all right.
  I enjoy teaching.

07:27.914 --> 07:30.183
 All right! This has been
 the best Cut Day yet.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.951
   And the most profitable.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.287
 I feel like I've already got
 Zack's 100 bucks in my pocket.

07:34.320 --> 07:38.058
 - You better check
 that pocket again.
- Both: Zack?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.660
  - Hey, how'd you get out?
  - I had a friend
  come and get me.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.963
 Remember, you promised to help
 support my "Mr.
 Ed" resolution.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.433
 Yes, you have my word,
 Franklin.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.069
 Give me my money now,

07:49.069 --> 07:51.071
  so I can head back to class
  before Belding catches me.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.240
 Time out. Wait a second.
 This is Cut Day not Cut Class.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.909
  You don't win the bet
  unless you show up

07:55.942 --> 07:58.211
 everywhere we go,
 all day long.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.380
You want me to sneak out
of every single class?

08:00.413 --> 08:03.016
   If you can't do it, Preppie,
   then I guess you lose.

08:03.049 --> 08:05.018
   - Just give me my money now.
   - No way.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.020
The bet's still on
and you're gonna lose.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.089
Wherever you go,
I'll be there.

08:09.122 --> 08:11.291
  All right.
  Come on, let's go.

08:15.795 --> 08:18.431
   10, nine...
   I knew he'd cut.

08:18.465 --> 08:21.267
   I know Zack Morris
   like the back of my hand.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.236
 five, four,

08:23.269 --> 08:25.572
 three, two...

08:25.605 --> 08:28.408
   Mr. Belding!
   What a pleasant surprise.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.843
 What brings you to study hall?

08:29.876 --> 08:32.779
Don't get cocky, Zack.
I've got my eye on you.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.847
   Sorry,
   sir, you're not my type.

08:34.881 --> 08:36.649
( bell rings )

08:43.556 --> 08:47.660
 Okay, nobody's here.
 Free period.
 Do whatever you want.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.696
  You were gone a long time.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.698
They must have put it
to you at the library.

08:51.731 --> 08:54.367
   Oh, get real.
   I was at The Max.

08:54.401 --> 08:56.569
- You cut? How'd you get...
- Huh-uh-uh.

08:56.603 --> 08:59.539
  A great magician
  never reveals his secrets.

08:59.572 --> 09:02.475
   Now, I've got to figure out
   my next disappearing act.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.611
I gotta paint signs
for the rally.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.347
  Oh, great idea.
  Can I help?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.349
  Sure. How are you
  at slogans?

09:09.382 --> 09:12.485
Oh, my specialty.
How's this one?

09:12.519 --> 09:15.755
"Plastic Foam:
the Choice of Idiots."

09:15.789 --> 09:19.392
 Maybe just a wee bit
 too intense.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.861
   Mr. Maloney,
   can I go to the bathroom?

09:21.895 --> 09:23.496
  Aw.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.399
  All right. Thanks.

09:28.568 --> 09:31.705
   Okay, let's see what we got.
   "Drink Now, Die Later."

09:31.738 --> 09:33.840
   "Go Home Plastic Foam"...

09:33.873 --> 09:35.575
This one's my favorite.

09:35.608 --> 09:38.111
   "It's Time to Wake Up;
   Drink From a Paper Cup."

09:38.144 --> 09:40.480
  Protest poetry, I love it.

09:43.616 --> 09:45.385
 Why are you so happy?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.954
  Well, I did a little
  painting of my own.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.958
   Oh, tell me
   he skipped out...

09:53.793 --> 09:56.663
    Woman over PA: <i>Mr. Belding,</i>
   <i>your car is being towed.</i>

09:56.696 --> 09:58.865
<i>You parked</i>
<i>it in a red zone.</i>

09:58.898 --> 10:01.868
What? I did not park
in a red zone!

10:03.770 --> 10:05.905
  Guess who painted the curb.

10:06.906 --> 10:09.509
 ( suspenseful music playing )

10:13.947 --> 10:15.915
 Want some
 imported chocolates?

10:15.949 --> 10:18.485
- Where are they from?
- Afghanistan.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.588
  They make the best
  chocolate-covered
  grasshoppers in the world.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.723
  - Grasshoppers!
  - ( gags )

10:24.824 --> 10:26.893
  How about a beetle?

10:28.528 --> 10:30.463
   Oh, look a wing.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.901
   You know, Kelly, I am
   really glad we came here.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.737
 Jessie wouldn't
 go to this kind
 of flick in a million years.

10:37.771 --> 10:38.872
 I love a good scare.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.841
I saw "Revenge of
the Zombie Headhunters"
seven times.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.677
   I really wanted
   to see that one,

10:43.710 --> 10:45.845
 but Jessie wouldn't go
 because I
 couldn't convince her

10:45.879 --> 10:48.682
that zombie headhunters
were feminists.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.017
( both groan )

10:51.051 --> 10:53.853
   Uh oh.
   The creature's
   starting to ooze.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.056
  ( creature howls )

10:56.089 --> 10:58.725
  ( Screech screams )

10:58.758 --> 11:00.860
  - Look what you did, Screech.
  - Hey, don't complain.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.496
 You got all the ones
 with butter.

11:10.603 --> 11:12.072
  ( screams )

11:12.806 --> 11:14.974
- Screech!
- Shh!

11:15.075 --> 11:17.577
Hush. It's me.

11:17.610 --> 11:21.081
   - What's going on here?
   - The monster
   just ate Burbank.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.083
   No, I mean between
   Kelly and Slater.

11:23.083 --> 11:26.086
  He didn't eat them, Zack.
  They're fine.

11:29.789 --> 11:31.725
- ( clears throat )
- Zack.

11:31.758 --> 11:33.960
  It was a really
  scary moment in the movie.

11:33.993 --> 11:37.097
   Uh-huh. Well, this is
   a scary moment
   for you, Slater.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.965
  I got out again.
  You're gonna lose.

11:38.998 --> 11:42.569
 Well,
 don't be so sure, Preppie.
 You never know what'll happen.

11:42.602 --> 11:44.738
  ( growls )

11:44.771 --> 11:46.840
 No, I guess
 you never do.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.683
   The delivery person
   will be here any minute,

11:56.716 --> 11:58.918
so we have to block
the hall by ourselves.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.054
   We can do it. It's not
   how many of us there are,

12:01.087 --> 12:02.689
  it's how much
  we believe.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.759
  I've never met
  anyone else quite like you.

12:05.792 --> 12:08.962
- Is that a compliment?
- Yeah, you bet it is.

12:10.597 --> 12:12.165
   Hi, guys.
   ( sighs )

12:12.198 --> 12:14.100
   Ah ha!
   Ha ha ha!

12:14.134 --> 12:17.637
  This time I caught you.
  What do you
  think you're doing?

12:17.671 --> 12:19.706
- Uh...what am I doing?
- Uh-huh.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.974
 Um...

12:21.074 --> 12:22.942
   I'm exercising my
   right to protest.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.778
   Yes! Power to the people!

12:24.811 --> 12:27.080
Right on! Go team, go!

12:27.113 --> 12:29.082
   Graham: Hey, there he is!

12:29.115 --> 12:31.384
   Both: One, two, three, four,
   don't use
   plastic foam no more!

12:31.418 --> 12:33.353
  Yeah!
  Five, six, seven, eight...

12:33.386 --> 12:36.089
   nine, 10, 11, 12!

12:36.122 --> 12:39.092
   All right. You have
   made your point.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.894
  Now, let the man
  make his delivery.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.163
Mr. Belding, don't you
care about our future?

12:43.196 --> 12:45.932
  I care about running
  an orderly school.

12:45.965 --> 12:47.934
 If you don't want
 plastic foam,

12:47.967 --> 12:50.704
 then present a petition
 to the school board.

12:50.737 --> 12:54.174
 Now go to class before
 I present all three of you
 with detention.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.942
  Zack: Hey.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.813
  Ah!

13:01.047 --> 13:02.749
 - Hey, Jessie...
 - Graham, we failed.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.150
No, we didn't.

13:04.184 --> 13:07.887
  If we convinced
  even one person
  then we succeeded.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.689
 Right, Zack?

13:09.723 --> 13:11.791
  Graham, you failed.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.730
 When you try
 and save the world
 and people don't even care...

13:16.763 --> 13:19.899
You start to think
what's the use?

13:19.933 --> 13:22.135
You really understand
how I feel, don't you?

13:22.168 --> 13:25.839
  Yeah, I do, 'cause I feel
  the same way.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.941
  But I keep trying.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.914
   What a Cut Day.
   Some people are
   ditching classes;

13:34.948 --> 13:37.117
   some people
   are ditching each other.

13:42.088 --> 13:44.090
( rock music playing )

14:11.151 --> 14:13.186
 You're really
 a hot dancer, Slater.

14:13.219 --> 14:15.288
  Oh, thanks.
  So are you.

14:15.321 --> 14:17.457
 - But your
 shoulders are too hot.
 - What?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.059
  They're burning up.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.727
 Come here let me put
 some lotion on them.

14:20.760 --> 14:22.295
  Oh, thanks.

14:24.330 --> 14:27.734
   You know, Kelly, this is
   a new experience for me,

14:27.767 --> 14:31.071
 spending
 the whole day with a girl
 and not getting into a fight.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.140
   This is the most fun
   I've had in a long time.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.444
 Lisa, my shoulders
 are getting red too.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.312
Could you put some
lotion on them?

14:39.346 --> 14:42.582
 Why don't I bury
 you in the sand,
 then the sun won't bother you?

14:42.615 --> 14:45.251
That's a terrific idea.

14:45.285 --> 14:48.321
 - Sure you won't mind?
 - I won't mind a bit.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.523
  Just wish
  I had a bulldozer.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.128
 Hey, everybody!
 Let's party!

14:55.161 --> 14:57.130
- All right!
- Yeah!

14:57.163 --> 14:59.366
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

14:59.399 --> 15:01.267
  Why are you
  dressed like that?

15:01.301 --> 15:03.236
 Let's just say,
 Ernie the custodian,

15:03.269 --> 15:05.271
  well, he's wearing
  a blond wig

15:05.305 --> 15:07.507
and he's taking
my French test.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.045
Gee, Zack, I knew
you'd show up.

15:12.045 --> 15:15.081
 I saved my last box of
 chocolate-covered
 grasshoppers for you.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.283
  - You're my hero.
  - Thanks, Screech.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.086
   I'll, uh...
   gosh, I'll eat 'em later.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.488
  It's not smart to swim
  on a full stomach.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.790
  - You're right. Safety first.
  - Yup.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.292
 All right, Lisa.
 You can bury me now.

15:26.326 --> 15:28.061
With pleasure.

15:29.562 --> 15:33.266
 So, bud, getting ready
 to pay up?

15:33.299 --> 15:34.434
It's not over yet, bud.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.303
 You still have to show up
 at The Max during last period.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.306
  That's no problem. I have
  Mrs. Culpepper last period.

15:40.340 --> 15:43.309
 A herd of elephants
 could sneak out of her class.

15:43.343 --> 15:46.112
 I better go get us some drinks
 while I still have some cash.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.081
  I'll be right back.

15:51.685 --> 15:55.155
So, looks like you've
been enjoying Cut Day.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.257
  I really have.
  That's the problem.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.292
Why? You're supposed
to have fun on Cut Day.

15:59.325 --> 16:00.860
But not this much fun.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.229
   I mean, not with my
   best friend's boyfriend.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.498
When I think of poor Jessie
stuck in school,

16:05.532 --> 16:08.101
  while I'm at the beach
  having a great
  time with Slater...

16:08.134 --> 16:10.270
  I wouldn't feel too sorry
  for poor Jessie.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.639
 Come on, Zack.
 If the situation was reversed,

16:12.672 --> 16:16.109
 can you imagine Jessie
 getting closer to another guy?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.511
   Well, you know,
   if I really force myself,

16:18.545 --> 16:20.380
   I think I could.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.119
  - Here you go, Kelly.
  - Thanks.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.487
   - Zack.
   - Thanks.

16:30.590 --> 16:33.660
   - Here you go, Lisa.
   - Thanks.

16:33.693 --> 16:36.663
 - You want some soda, Screech?
 - Screech: Thanks.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.671
  ( belches )

16:51.311 --> 16:53.546
  Hi, Mrs. Culpepper.

16:53.580 --> 16:56.282
Oh, good afternoon,
Zack.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.388
   This is too easy.

17:01.421 --> 17:05.657
 I am touched that everyone
 showed up on Cut Day.

17:05.692 --> 17:09.262
  Now, let's travel
  to Africa.

17:13.465 --> 17:15.635
   Nigeria is here.

17:17.637 --> 17:20.272
  Next to Las Vegas?

17:20.306 --> 17:22.375
 I wouldn't bet on it.

17:22.409 --> 17:25.512
  Mrs. Culpepper!
  Mrs.
  Culpepper, congratulations!

17:25.545 --> 17:27.380
We just
received this telegram.

17:27.414 --> 17:30.650
  You have won
  $2 million in the lottery.

17:30.684 --> 17:32.452
  Oh!

17:34.354 --> 17:37.424
 - I'm so happy for you.
 - Oh,
 I don't care what you think.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.293
 Good riddance to you
 and my lousy salary.

17:40.326 --> 17:41.828
   I'm out of here.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.801
   ( phone ringing )

17:51.738 --> 17:52.739
Hello.

17:52.772 --> 17:56.576
 Did Mrs. Culpepper
 get my telegram yet, Preppie?

17:56.609 --> 17:58.812
  Slater.
  What are you up to?

17:58.845 --> 18:02.282
  You'll see,
  'cause if I know Belding...

18:02.315 --> 18:04.684
  All right,
  put that phone away, Zack.

18:04.718 --> 18:07.687
 You are finishing the day
 right here at school

18:07.721 --> 18:10.690
 and I am
 staying here with you,
 to keep you company.

18:10.724 --> 18:13.293
The rest of you may go.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.828
   Gotcha, Preppie.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.733
   This does not look good.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.770
 You know, Zack, I will be glad
 when this day is over.

18:23.803 --> 18:27.841
 I've been so
 busy keeping an eye
 on you I forgot to have lunch.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.642
   Thank you, Lord.

18:29.676 --> 18:32.579
   Sir, I happen to have
   some candy here.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.315
Would you like a piece?

18:35.348 --> 18:37.650
   That is very thoughtful.
   Thank you, Zack.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.619
Yes, I would like some.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.826
Oh, thank you.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.630
 Mmm... good.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.732
Yeah, they're imported.

18:52.766 --> 18:54.634
- It's crunchy.
- Yeah.

18:54.668 --> 18:57.404
But it doesn't
really taste like nuts.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.805
 What is it, exactly?

18:58.838 --> 19:00.807
 It's chocolate-covered
 grasshoppers.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.043
  ( laughs )

19:03.076 --> 19:05.278
   ( gulps )

19:05.311 --> 19:08.415
And the crunchy part's
the thorax. ( laughs )

19:14.120 --> 19:16.656
   - Have you seen Belding?
   - He just ran by
   here in a panic.

19:16.690 --> 19:19.592
- What's wrong?
- He has a stomach bug.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.428
- Off to The Max. Bye.
- We'll see you there.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.396
Okay. Not okay!

19:23.430 --> 19:26.433
 If Jessie sees Slater
 with Kelly and Slater
 sees Jessie with Graham,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.668
   Cut Day becomes Kill Day.

19:28.702 --> 19:31.871
   Um... Jessie, you can't
   go to The Max right now.

19:31.905 --> 19:33.773
   Why not?

19:33.807 --> 19:36.343
  Because you guys were
  gonna save the world today.

19:36.376 --> 19:39.612
 We tried. Now we're gonna
 take the rest of the day off.

19:39.646 --> 19:42.415
 Why don't you go to the beach?
 It's sunnier than The Max.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.584
 Too much sun
 is bad for you, Zack.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.453
   Stay out of this,
   paleface.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.822
   - Let's go, Jess.
   - No, no! Jessie, Jessie!

19:48.855 --> 19:52.425
  - You don't understand...
  - Zack Morris!

19:52.459 --> 19:54.594
   Trying to cut
   at the last minute, huh?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.530
 Sir, you misjudge me.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.600
 I was just coming to
 see if you were all right.
 I was concerned.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.936
Whoa... oh, no.

20:02.969 --> 20:05.772
 I appreciate your concern.
 I'm all right now.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.708
I'm just a little weak.

20:08.742 --> 20:10.010
   Then you should eat, sir.

20:10.043 --> 20:11.745
Would you like
another piece of candy?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.214
  - ( groans )
  - No, don't worry.

20:14.247 --> 20:17.650
   It's not chocolate
   and it's no grasshopper.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.787
   All right, thanks, Zack.
   Thanks.

20:20.820 --> 20:24.524
- Hard to get, huh?
- I got it, thank you.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.227
 - Mmm.
 - Mmm. Yeah.

20:27.260 --> 20:29.496
- This is great!
- Yeah?

20:29.529 --> 20:32.232
  - What is it?
  - Well,
  it's a caramel caterpillar.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.967
 Have another?

20:36.803 --> 20:39.072
  Hope I can beat
  Jessie to The Max.

20:41.107 --> 20:44.878
   At the tone the time
   will be... beep... 3:30.

20:44.911 --> 20:47.547
 Zack owes me
 100 smackers.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.583
 - Yo, Slater!
 - Too late, Preppie.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.686
  - Is Jessie already here?
  - Jessie?

20:52.719 --> 20:55.989
 What's Jessie
 got to do with it?
 You just lost a bet.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.891
 Let's go to the bank right now
 and get your money.

20:57.924 --> 20:59.292
   What's the rush?

20:59.325 --> 21:01.695
  - ( Jessie laughing )
  - Jessie?

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
 - Slater?
 - Hi.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.900
   Hi. I think
   we need to talk.

21:06.933 --> 21:08.968
  - Yeah, maybe we do.
  - Oh, no you don't!

21:09.069 --> 21:11.838
 Come on,
 everybody, let's dance.
 Slater you can dance with me.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.607
   - Let's sit here.
   - ( Zack groans )

21:17.077 --> 21:20.780
  Brace yourself, guys.
  You're about to
  see some fireworks.

21:20.814 --> 21:24.551
  Look,
  Slater, we went the whole day
  without seeing each other.

21:24.584 --> 21:25.885
  I don't know how you feel,

21:25.919 --> 21:28.788
but I enjoyed spending time
with someone else.

21:28.822 --> 21:31.791
- You mean Graham?
- Yes.

21:31.825 --> 21:35.562
  Look,
  it's been great going steady,
  but we do fight a lot.

21:35.595 --> 21:39.099
 Maybe it would be better if we
 started to see other people.

21:39.099 --> 21:41.835
 Yeah,
 that is a good idea.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.971
  - Now,
  don't take this too hard.
  - I'm not.

21:45.005 --> 21:46.740
   Time will heal your pain.

21:46.773 --> 21:50.010
 No, Jessie, I think seeing
 other people is a great idea.

21:50.110 --> 21:52.112
 - What?
 - I feel the same way you do.

21:52.145 --> 21:54.714
In fact, I had a great time
with Kelly today.

21:54.748 --> 21:57.817
 Kelly! You cheated
 on me with my friend?

21:57.851 --> 22:01.154
I told you. Here it comes.
"Feminist eats Tokyo."

22:02.088 --> 22:03.123
 Look, I didn't cheat on you.

22:03.156 --> 22:05.959
 I just had a fun day
 with a girl without arguing.

22:06.059 --> 22:08.862
  Why don't you just keep
  going out with other girls?

22:08.895 --> 22:11.698
I will... and you'll go out
with other guys.

22:11.731 --> 22:15.635
  We already said that,
  remember?
  Come on, it was your idea.

22:17.971 --> 22:20.607
  Look, they're
  laughing together.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.809
   I've never
   seen that before.

22:22.842 --> 22:25.111
 Man, I thought they were going
 to tear each other's eyes out.

22:25.145 --> 22:28.815
   Come on, Zack, that only
   happens in zombie movies.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.217
   Guys, we want you
   to be the first to know.

22:31.251 --> 22:34.087
 Slater and I have decided
 to date other people.

22:34.087 --> 22:36.122
 But you were
 so happy together...

22:36.156 --> 22:39.092
  every now and then.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.126
   Don't worry. Jessie and I
   are still gonna go out...

22:41.961 --> 22:44.931
  whenever we feel
  the need for a good fight.
