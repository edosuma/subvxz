WEBVTT

00:03.703 --> 00:05.037
(laughter, chatter)

00:05.039 --> 00:06.481
Hey, guys, why don't
you go upstairs

00:06.482 --> 00:07.814
and wash your hands
before dinner.

00:07.817 --> 00:09.066
(laughter)

00:09.068 --> 00:10.851
I know I only met
you guys at the wedding,

00:10.853 --> 00:12.536
but the amount of times
your name comes up here,

00:12.538 --> 00:14.121
you would think that we
were next-door neighbors.

00:14.123 --> 00:16.290
Well, we practically are now.
Just over the bridge.

00:16.292 --> 00:17.124
Mm-hmm.
Yep.

00:17.126 --> 00:18.492
Don't tell anyone,

00:18.494 --> 00:19.943
but I think
he missed you.

00:19.945 --> 00:22.445
Well, I might've
told some stories

00:22.447 --> 00:23.964
from the old days
now and again.

00:23.966 --> 00:25.549
Aw, do you miss me, buddy?

00:25.551 --> 00:27.384
Yeah, you know I do.

00:27.386 --> 00:29.119
Oh, you should talk.

00:29.121 --> 00:30.420
This one goes on about

00:30.422 --> 00:31.839
his boyhood
BFF so much,

00:31.841 --> 00:33.140
when our kids were little,

00:33.142 --> 00:34.975
they thought Danny Reagan
was the name of a superhero.

00:34.977 --> 00:37.177
It's not?

00:37.179 --> 00:39.847
She's funny.
She's funny.

00:39.849 --> 00:42.649
No, but all jokes aside,
it's... having you guys here,

00:42.651 --> 00:44.651
it's like an early
Christmas present.

00:44.653 --> 00:45.686
Same here.

00:46.571 --> 00:48.071
And it's permanent now?

00:48.073 --> 00:49.573
It's official?

00:49.575 --> 00:50.491
I mean, no more Florida?

00:50.493 --> 00:52.826
Bye-bye, Boca.
Hello, Bay Ridge.

00:52.828 --> 00:54.661
Hello, Bay Ridge.

00:54.663 --> 00:56.330
No, you know,
with my mom being sick,

00:56.332 --> 00:57.447
it was time to come home.

00:57.449 --> 00:59.199
Oh, I'm sorry
to hear about that.

00:59.201 --> 01:00.167
Thanks.

01:00.169 --> 01:01.535
Sit down, relax.

01:01.537 --> 01:02.586
Thank you.

01:02.588 --> 01:03.754
But you know what's nice

01:03.756 --> 01:05.589
is that we'll actually
get to know you guys

01:05.591 --> 01:06.656
after all these years.

01:06.658 --> 01:08.175
Yeah, we should make
something official,

01:08.177 --> 01:09.626
like, uh, once a week,

01:09.628 --> 01:11.628
either dinner or a game
or something.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.680
Done and doner.
All right.

01:13.682 --> 01:14.765
We just hope you're happy here

01:14.767 --> 01:15.883
and you don't miss
Florida too much.

01:15.885 --> 01:18.685
Speaking of missing Florida...

01:18.687 --> 01:21.038
you must've done
pretty well down there

01:21.040 --> 01:22.356
in the Sunshine State,
my friend,

01:22.358 --> 01:24.191
with that, uh,
snazzy Benz you pulled up in.

01:24.193 --> 01:25.692
MICKEY (laughs):
I got lucky.

01:25.694 --> 01:28.678
I wind up in real
estate after college.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.864
Right time,
right place, I guess.

01:30.866 --> 01:32.616
CONNIE: Mickey's being modest.
He works really hard

01:32.618 --> 01:35.202
to give our family
life's little extras.

01:35.204 --> 01:36.519
Um...

01:36.521 --> 01:38.906
Babe, I'm gonna, um,
take the trash cans out, okay?

01:38.908 --> 01:40.374
Danny, we're about to sit.

01:40.376 --> 01:41.942
Yeah, I know. It's, uh...

01:41.944 --> 01:43.710
If I don't do it now,
I'll forget, so...

01:43.712 --> 01:44.962
Yobou obokobay?

01:44.964 --> 01:47.080
Tobotobally.

01:47.082 --> 01:49.032
What on earth was that?

01:49.034 --> 01:51.835
Ob. I never told you about ob?

01:51.837 --> 01:52.669
Ob?

01:52.671 --> 01:54.137
Yeah, it's-it's their

01:54.139 --> 01:55.889
secret language
from fifth grade?

01:55.891 --> 01:57.040
That's right.

01:57.042 --> 01:59.393
Danny made me learn that
before we got engaged.

01:59.395 --> 02:00.644
Oh, brother.

02:00.646 --> 02:01.678
Yeah.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.096
Here, have some more.

02:03.098 --> 02:04.264
We're gonna need it.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.693
(engine starts)

02:35.746 --> 02:37.514
The perp came running
out of the liquor store

02:37.516 --> 02:38.715
with a bag of cash,

02:38.717 --> 02:42.469
and the clerk right behind him
with a baseball bat.

02:42.471 --> 02:45.355
I yelled, "Police, don't move."

02:45.357 --> 02:47.024
I saw a flash,

02:47.026 --> 02:48.925
and the next thing I know,
I'm lying here.

02:48.927 --> 02:52.529
That flash was a .9 millimeter
in the hand of the wheelman.

02:52.531 --> 02:54.314
I should have seen him coming.

02:54.316 --> 02:56.566
He was around a corner.

02:56.568 --> 02:58.318
When he heard you,
he came out blasting.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.488
There's nothing
you could have done.

03:01.490 --> 03:05.125
The good news is the doctor says
you're going to be just fine.

03:05.127 --> 03:06.960
Yeah, he thinks
I can go home tomorrow.

03:06.962 --> 03:09.246
With a medal pinned
to your chest.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.800
Rest up.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.618
Thank you, Commissioner.

03:18.456 --> 03:21.124
The press is going
to want a few words.

03:21.126 --> 03:22.175
What else is new?

03:22.177 --> 03:23.644
Commissioner.

03:23.646 --> 03:25.562
As you were.

03:25.564 --> 03:26.730
Officer Wallace.

03:26.732 --> 03:27.731
Yes, sir.

03:27.733 --> 03:29.599
Partner's doing fine.

03:29.601 --> 03:30.967
And you both did good work.

03:30.969 --> 03:32.969
Well, we could have
done better, sir.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.571
He came out of a blind spot.

03:34.573 --> 03:35.822
You didn't stand a chance.

03:35.824 --> 03:36.857
That's just it, sir.

03:36.859 --> 03:38.808
That perp never should
have had that gun.

03:38.810 --> 03:42.029
The shooter-- I saw
him casing that shop

03:42.031 --> 03:42.996
four hours earlier.

03:42.998 --> 03:44.531
He kept patting
his hip, you know,

03:44.533 --> 03:46.816
like there was
a gun there...

03:49.003 --> 03:51.204
But you didn't question him.

03:52.423 --> 03:56.843
Because of the new restrictions
on Stop, Question and Frisk?

03:59.497 --> 04:01.548
The judge says we could
get sued personally

04:01.550 --> 04:02.849
if we do a wrong stop.

04:02.851 --> 04:05.168
And you didn't want
to take any chances.

04:06.020 --> 04:08.021
I screwed up, didn't I?

04:09.006 --> 04:10.507
No, son.

04:10.509 --> 04:12.693
We did.

04:20.151 --> 04:21.902
Hey, top of
the morning, Sarge.

04:21.904 --> 04:23.153
There you are.
Follow me.

04:23.155 --> 04:25.522
Little coffee first, boss?
Now.

04:25.524 --> 04:28.125
I got someone who
needs to talk to you.

04:28.127 --> 04:30.026
Okay.

04:30.028 --> 04:32.212
And bah humbug to you, too.

04:33.381 --> 04:36.383
Reagan, this is
Lieutenant Sutton from OCID.

04:37.585 --> 04:39.035
Lieutenant.

04:39.037 --> 04:40.370
Is there a problem?

04:40.372 --> 04:43.039
Well, frankly, that's what
we're here to find out.

04:43.041 --> 04:45.509
This is you,
isn't it, Detective?

04:45.511 --> 04:47.043
Yeah.

04:47.045 --> 04:50.097
That was you taking pictures
at my house?

04:50.099 --> 04:51.064
Yes, it was.

04:51.066 --> 04:52.766
What the hell
is going on here, Sarge?

04:52.768 --> 04:53.900
You got OCID
sitting on my house,

04:53.902 --> 04:55.885
taking pictures
of me and my family?

04:55.887 --> 04:57.687
No, they weren't taking
pictures of you, Danny.

04:57.689 --> 04:59.022
Like hell they weren't.

04:59.024 --> 05:00.407
We weren't on you,
Detective.

05:00.409 --> 05:02.109
We were on your pal,
Michael Patrick.

05:02.111 --> 05:03.443
Mickey?

05:03.445 --> 05:05.996
What... what the hell would
OCID want with Mickey?

05:05.998 --> 05:07.697
Well, maybe because
he's a known member

05:07.699 --> 05:08.832
of the Vasquez Family...

05:08.834 --> 05:10.500
Come on.
...the biggest crime family in Florida.

05:10.502 --> 05:12.369
Right.
And I'm the Lord of the Dance.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.571
I'm not horsing around,
Detective.

05:14.573 --> 05:16.923
Look, it can't be, okay?

05:16.925 --> 05:18.175
It's not even possible.

05:18.177 --> 05:20.761
Last month, the key players
from the top families

05:20.763 --> 05:22.212
across the country
held a summit

05:22.214 --> 05:23.930
masquerading as
a golf outing.

05:23.932 --> 05:25.048
Yeah, right. Okay.

05:25.050 --> 05:26.716
Now, look,
you got the wrong guy.

05:26.718 --> 05:28.718
Okay? Mickey's into real estate.

05:28.720 --> 05:31.438
Want to tell me
what your buddy

05:31.440 --> 05:33.223
in real estate was
doing with them?

05:33.225 --> 05:36.443
There he is, with the rest
of the Vasquez capos.

05:42.099 --> 05:43.700
Mickey's a gangster?

05:45.369 --> 05:46.936
Have a seat, Detective.

05:46.938 --> 05:49.122
We're gonna be
here a while.

Quality of life crime

Violent crime
is up 20.

06:24.992 --> 06:26.858
A judge rules against
Stop and Frisk

06:26.860 --> 06:29.227
and basically says,
"My work here is done."

06:29.229 --> 06:30.579
ARBOGAST:
And now you see the results.

06:30.581 --> 06:31.713
We've got a wounded cop

06:31.715 --> 06:33.448
that almost didn't
make it home to his family

06:33.450 --> 06:36.034
because this judge won't
let our cops do their jobs.

06:36.036 --> 06:38.704
This department
dates back to 1845.

06:38.706 --> 06:40.789
That's a whole lot of
good police work done

06:40.791 --> 06:42.924
before anyone came up
with Stop and Frisk.

06:42.926 --> 06:45.076
I think we should get these
numbers in front of the press.

06:45.078 --> 06:45.844
To what end?

06:45.846 --> 06:46.878
To get public opinion

06:46.880 --> 06:47.846
back on our side.

06:47.848 --> 06:49.247
In an effort to...?

06:49.249 --> 06:50.248
Ignite debate.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.633
Oh, come on, Garrett.

06:51.635 --> 06:52.917
The last thing
in the world

06:52.919 --> 06:54.252
this issue needs
is more debate.

06:54.254 --> 06:55.971
All due respect,
I think Garrett is right.

06:55.973 --> 06:58.423
People see those crime numbers,
they might rethink the issue.

06:58.425 --> 07:00.091
Well, a lot of good
it's gonna do them.

07:00.093 --> 07:01.393
The judge has ruled.

07:01.395 --> 07:03.195
It's a bad call.
Shouldn't we try to change it?

07:03.197 --> 07:04.946
Our job isn't
to change the law.

07:04.948 --> 07:08.933
Our job is to uphold the law--
even the ones we don't like.

07:08.935 --> 07:10.485
Frank, in all the years
I've known you,

07:10.487 --> 07:12.287
I've never once seen you
willing to give up.

07:12.289 --> 07:15.407
Who the hell said anything
about giving up?

07:18.944 --> 07:20.746
He never gave any hints
about his mob ties?

07:20.748 --> 07:21.997
No.

07:21.999 --> 07:24.583
Look, as far as I knew,
Mickey was making a killing

07:24.585 --> 07:26.551
selling beachfront property
to the Boca blue hairs.

07:26.553 --> 07:27.719
Well, he wasn't.

07:27.721 --> 07:29.471
He was help bringing
their crime business

07:29.473 --> 07:30.839
to the 21st century.

07:30.841 --> 07:33.759
Setting up shell companies,
offshore accounts, et cetera.

07:33.761 --> 07:36.061
Okay, so if he's some
Florida mob big shot,

07:36.063 --> 07:37.345
why'd he come back home?

07:37.347 --> 07:39.181
Expanding.

07:39.183 --> 07:41.233
The Vasquez family has
been building up relationships

07:41.235 --> 07:43.735
with some of the organized
crime outfits up here.

07:43.737 --> 07:46.488
Your buddy Mickey
is the go-between.

07:47.306 --> 07:49.357
(sighs):
Okay.

07:49.359 --> 07:51.443
If what you're
saying is true,

07:51.445 --> 07:53.161
well, then,
I guess Mickey...

07:53.163 --> 07:54.663
he deserves whatever
he's got coming.

07:54.665 --> 07:56.248
I'm glad you feel that way.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.332
Good.

07:57.334 --> 07:59.367
Let me know how it goes.

07:59.369 --> 08:01.169
Actually, we were hoping
you could help.

08:01.171 --> 08:02.587
Yeah.

08:02.589 --> 08:03.839
Thanks, but no thanks.

08:03.841 --> 08:04.923
Well, you said it yourself.

08:04.925 --> 08:06.258
He deserves
what he's got coming.

08:06.260 --> 08:08.493
If what you're saying is true.

08:08.495 --> 08:09.427
It is.

08:09.429 --> 08:11.329
Okay, suppose it is.

08:11.331 --> 08:12.664
It's a bad play.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.466
Mickey's no idiot.
He knows I'm a cop.

08:14.468 --> 08:16.051
He's not gonna spill
mob secrets to me

08:16.053 --> 08:18.470
just 'cause we goofed around
on the monkey bars as kids.

08:18.472 --> 08:19.855
I agree.

08:19.857 --> 08:21.022
We have to get creative.

08:21.024 --> 08:22.173
(sighs)

08:22.175 --> 08:23.859
Look, there are
a thousand other detectives

08:23.861 --> 08:25.727
who you could put
on this besides me.

08:25.729 --> 08:27.512
Yes, but there's
only one that he trusts.

08:27.514 --> 08:29.731
Does it mean anything to you
that he's my friend,

08:29.733 --> 08:30.899
that we grew up together?

08:30.901 --> 08:32.650
Means everything.

08:32.653 --> 08:34.068
Means you could get close.

08:34.071 --> 08:36.154
You could put him in
a compromising position.

08:36.155 --> 08:37.706
It means if we flip him,

08:37.707 --> 08:41.042
we just took down the biggest
mob operation in 20 years.

08:41.044 --> 08:42.878
And it also means

08:42.880 --> 08:46.331
that I will have
sold my soul.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.133
I got cases to work.

08:49.585 --> 08:52.704
Right now, I'm asking
for your help, Detective.

08:52.706 --> 08:54.472
But I don't have to ask.

09:06.435 --> 09:07.886
Mickey is a wise guy?

09:07.888 --> 09:09.053
That's what I'm saying.

09:09.055 --> 09:10.572
It can't be, right?

09:10.574 --> 09:12.390
Well, I'm surprised,

09:12.392 --> 09:14.359
but I'm not exactly
blown away.

09:14.361 --> 09:15.327
What do you mean?

09:15.329 --> 09:16.695
It's not like
I was an angel.

09:16.697 --> 09:18.246
I mean, every time
Mickey got in trouble,

09:18.248 --> 09:19.414
I was right there with him.

09:19.416 --> 09:20.532
Yeah, which is why Dad

09:20.534 --> 09:21.783
never liked you
hanging around him

09:21.785 --> 09:23.535
and always kept you
on a short leash.

09:23.537 --> 09:24.903
Don't remind me.

09:24.905 --> 09:26.154
You remember that time

09:26.156 --> 09:27.505
you guys got caught
for shoplifting

09:27.507 --> 09:29.674
down at Jim Duffy's
five and dime?

09:29.676 --> 09:31.409
Yeah. Thought the
old man was gonna

09:31.411 --> 09:32.911
pull the slapper out for sure.

09:32.913 --> 09:34.095
Yeah, and that's
when Mom

09:34.097 --> 09:35.764
wanted to send you
to military school.

09:35.766 --> 09:36.915
Do you know why?

09:36.917 --> 09:40.418
Let me guess: because
Mickey was a bad influence?

09:40.420 --> 09:42.721
No. Because she always
thought you had a blind spot

09:42.723 --> 09:43.972
when it came to Mickey.

09:43.974 --> 09:45.724
You know, there's
a story about that day

09:45.726 --> 09:47.108
that I never told anyone.

09:47.110 --> 09:49.561
Mickey was halfway home
when the cops rolled up on me.

09:49.563 --> 09:51.730
Now, anyone else would've
kept going, but he didn't.

09:51.732 --> 09:53.264
When he heard I was
getting pinched,

09:53.266 --> 09:55.367
he turned around
and he took the rap with me.

09:55.369 --> 09:57.869
Okay, so now he's
a stand-up guy, is that it?

09:57.871 --> 09:59.270
Oh... maybe.

09:59.272 --> 10:02.540
Maybe you still
have a blind spot.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.209
Or maybe OCID got it wrong.

10:04.211 --> 10:06.328
If they were coming
to get you

10:06.330 --> 10:07.963
to lock up one of your friends,

10:07.965 --> 10:10.081
would you just take
their word for it?

10:13.118 --> 10:15.136
Okay, you have
a point, Danny.

10:15.138 --> 10:17.172
If I was going after
one of my friends,

10:17.174 --> 10:19.891
I would make damn sure
they were no good first.

10:29.185 --> 10:31.353

He just got off on 16.

12:08.085 --> 12:09.918
Sixteen.

12:31.307 --> 12:33.942
Punch me in the face.

12:33.944 --> 12:34.976
What?

12:34.978 --> 12:37.929
I'm not kidding.
Come on, hit me.

12:37.931 --> 12:40.098
Detective,
what the hell's going on?

12:40.100 --> 12:41.232
We tailed Mickey.

12:41.234 --> 12:42.951
Keyed his way
into an office on Madison

12:42.953 --> 12:45.703
under the name
of Gator Empire, Inc.

12:45.705 --> 12:48.373
It's a shell corp
for the Vasquez family.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.991
I'm sorry.

12:49.993 --> 12:52.794
Yeah, so am I.

12:52.796 --> 12:54.278
So, does this mean
that you're in?

12:54.280 --> 12:55.330
On one condition.

12:55.332 --> 12:56.447
You got to offer him
witness protection.

12:56.449 --> 12:57.382
Done.

12:57.384 --> 12:59.634
All right,
go ahead and punch me.

12:59.636 --> 13:00.752
You're nuts.

13:00.754 --> 13:02.286
Just do it already.

13:02.288 --> 13:04.455
(grunts)

13:15.530 --> 13:17.280
How'd you get
the shiner, Reagan?

13:17.282 --> 13:18.565
You step out of line with Linda?

13:18.567 --> 13:22.119
Yeah, left my socks
on the floor again.

13:22.121 --> 13:23.670
Closed eighteens.
You're up.

13:23.672 --> 13:25.839
Yeah, seriously though,
what happened?

13:25.841 --> 13:27.340
Perils of the job.

13:27.342 --> 13:29.342
Mm-hmm.
DANNY: Oh, no. No, no.

13:29.344 --> 13:30.260
Come on!
What's wrong?

13:30.262 --> 13:32.429
Mack Daddy's losing.

13:32.431 --> 13:34.131
Come on, come on!

13:34.133 --> 13:36.316
(chuckles): You betting
the ponies, Reagan?

13:36.318 --> 13:38.218
I got a little action
going, come on.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.937
Come on, come on!
A lot of action?

13:40.939 --> 13:42.939
DANNY: He's ten lengths
behind this horse!

13:42.941 --> 13:45.058
How does he lose
that race?!

13:45.060 --> 13:47.644
Unbelievable.
Bartender! Two more.

13:47.646 --> 13:49.813
Danny, how much you bet?

13:51.082 --> 13:53.650
He's the back end of my double.

13:53.652 --> 13:54.951
(scoffs)

13:54.953 --> 13:56.119
You bet a daily double?

13:56.121 --> 13:57.320
Reagan, that's a sucker bet.

13:57.322 --> 13:58.739
Yeah, well, call me a sucker.

13:58.741 --> 14:00.457
No, not the Danny Reagan I know.

14:00.459 --> 14:03.126
Now, why don't you tell me
how you got a black eye.

14:03.128 --> 14:04.661
Don't worry about it, okay?

14:04.663 --> 14:06.830
No, you know, that's what I do
because that's what friends do.

14:06.832 --> 14:10.050
(sighs)

14:10.052 --> 14:12.469
Look, I tell you,
you can't tell a soul, okay?

14:12.471 --> 14:14.054
No.
Not even Connie.

14:14.056 --> 14:17.057
I sobwobear obon moby lobife.

14:17.059 --> 14:18.425
What's going on?

14:18.427 --> 14:19.676
Come on.

14:19.678 --> 14:20.644
(sighs)

14:20.646 --> 14:22.395
I'm in a hole, Mick.

14:22.397 --> 14:24.014
Yeah?
Yeah.

14:24.016 --> 14:25.932
How deep?
12 feet.

14:25.934 --> 14:28.268
$12,000?
Things just got a little out of hand.

14:28.270 --> 14:30.470
That's all.
A lot out of hand, Danny.

14:30.472 --> 14:32.189
You know how it is, Mick.

14:32.191 --> 14:34.941
I fell behind, I tried
to double up and catch up.

14:34.943 --> 14:37.027
Stupid horse was
gonna be my Hail Mary.

14:37.029 --> 14:38.662
She didn't come
through for you.

14:38.664 --> 14:40.447
No.

14:40.449 --> 14:42.666
Built a real house of cards.

14:44.085 --> 14:46.286
Behind on the car payment,
the kids' tuition,

14:46.288 --> 14:48.922
took out a pension loan.

14:48.924 --> 14:51.424
It's only a matter of time
before Linda finds out,

14:51.426 --> 14:53.627
and that's
when I'm really screwed.

14:54.846 --> 14:57.464
Listen to me.

14:57.466 --> 14:58.765
I'm gonna help, all right?

14:58.767 --> 14:59.999
I'm gonna give you the money.
No, no.

15:00.001 --> 15:01.635
You're gonna pay me
back when you can.

15:01.637 --> 15:03.136
No interest. I insist.
No, forget about it.

15:03.138 --> 15:03.854
Forget about it.

15:03.856 --> 15:05.188
Danny.

15:05.190 --> 15:07.641
Mick, you and I both know
what money does to friendships.

15:07.643 --> 15:09.810
You've been gone
all these years,

15:09.812 --> 15:12.145
you just got back;
I'm not gonna screw this up

15:12.147 --> 15:13.697
over my problems, no way.

15:13.699 --> 15:16.650
I-I hear you, but...

15:16.652 --> 15:18.685
what are you gonna do?

15:18.687 --> 15:22.522
Put in some overtime,
couple odd jobs, I guess.

15:22.524 --> 15:23.623
12 grand in overtime?

15:23.625 --> 15:27.544
What other choice do I have?

15:31.382 --> 15:33.667
Well, let me think
about this, look...

15:36.420 --> 15:37.754
I might know a guy

15:37.756 --> 15:40.540
that might be able to
give you some work.

15:42.226 --> 15:43.393
Yeah?

15:43.395 --> 15:45.512
Yeah, but no promises.

15:45.514 --> 15:46.730
And no more betting.

15:46.732 --> 15:48.932
All right, no more betting.

15:59.243 --> 16:02.245
(door opens)

16:02.247 --> 16:03.413
Frank.

16:03.415 --> 16:06.065
Mr. Mayor.

16:06.067 --> 16:08.285
I just got word
from the hospital

16:08.287 --> 16:09.669
that they will be sending

16:09.671 --> 16:12.255
Officer Powell home
this afternoon.

16:12.257 --> 16:13.423
That's good news.

16:13.425 --> 16:17.294
Yes, he's recovering nicely.

16:17.296 --> 16:19.078
His partner's wounds, however,

16:19.080 --> 16:21.798
might take a while
longer to heal.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.916
I'm sorry, Frank, I wasn't aware

16:22.918 --> 16:24.083
there was
another officer injured.

16:24.085 --> 16:26.469
Well, a few hours
before the shooting,

16:26.471 --> 16:28.772
his partner observed the shooter

16:28.774 --> 16:30.774
and thought he might be
carrying a weapon.

16:30.776 --> 16:33.092
But fearing that a judge
might rule his actions

16:33.094 --> 16:35.478
to be a violation
of civil rights,

16:35.480 --> 16:38.615
he chose not to stop
and question the individual.

16:38.617 --> 16:39.950
If you've come here to tell me

16:39.952 --> 16:41.368
that your men and women
are handicapped...

16:41.370 --> 16:43.019
I didn't.
...because they can no longer

16:43.021 --> 16:45.322
toss black men against
the wall for no reason,

16:45.324 --> 16:47.791
you've come to the wrong person.

16:47.793 --> 16:48.825
Aw, cut it out.

16:48.827 --> 16:50.276
I know exactly
where this is going, Frank.

16:50.278 --> 16:53.496
No, you don't.

16:53.498 --> 16:57.334
I'm not here looking to reopen
Stop, Question and Frisk.

16:57.336 --> 17:00.804
But our crime stats are now
headed in the wrong direction.

17:00.806 --> 17:02.005
I've seen the numbers,

17:02.007 --> 17:03.390
and I'm confident
you can turn them around.

17:03.392 --> 17:05.976
The judge's new rules say
we must have

17:05.978 --> 17:09.429
significant cause before we stop
and question individuals.

17:09.431 --> 17:11.815
That's how it is.

17:11.817 --> 17:13.148
But we'd like some help.

17:13.151 --> 17:15.185
Frank, I'll do anything
I can to help.

17:15.186 --> 17:16.301
You know that.

17:16.304 --> 17:19.305
Good.

17:19.307 --> 17:21.907
I would like you to go
to the press and explain

17:21.910 --> 17:24.493
that See Something,
Say Something no longer applies

17:24.496 --> 17:28.164
to just stray backpacks
and unattended luggage.

17:28.165 --> 17:30.533
If we're gonna
stop someone,

17:30.535 --> 17:32.585
we need to show just cause,

17:32.587 --> 17:35.005
and a phone call
from a concerned citizen

17:35.007 --> 17:36.339
goes a long way.

17:36.341 --> 17:39.292
Frank, you want me to ask
the people of our city

17:39.294 --> 17:41.294
to be on the lookout for crime?

17:41.296 --> 17:43.046
That's gonna make
people nervous.

17:43.048 --> 17:46.099
Mr. Mayor,

17:46.101 --> 17:50.103
the last two decades have shown
dramatic decreases in crime.

17:50.105 --> 17:52.055
Our job is to sustain that

17:52.057 --> 17:56.059
under new
and more challenging conditions.

17:56.061 --> 17:58.344
But we can't do it alone.

17:58.346 --> 18:01.865
Let me think about it.

18:03.451 --> 18:05.952
You don't want to go near this.

18:05.954 --> 18:08.571
Frank, I said
let me think about it.

18:10.491 --> 18:12.692
Please do.

18:15.079 --> 18:17.747
(door opens, closes)

18:17.749 --> 18:20.450
(sighs)

18:20.452 --> 18:23.303
You know, I can't believe
you got a table in this place.

18:23.305 --> 18:24.921
We've been trying
to come here for months.

18:24.923 --> 18:26.056
How did you do it?

18:26.058 --> 18:27.724
Oh, Mickey has
a fancy friend.

18:27.726 --> 18:30.226
Some Wall Street guy
I sold a house to, that's it.

18:30.228 --> 18:31.394
Well, that's what we need, hon.

18:31.396 --> 18:32.679
We need a fancy friend.

18:32.681 --> 18:34.097
Well, we got a fancy friend
of a friend,

18:34.099 --> 18:35.231
how's that?
Yeah!

18:35.233 --> 18:37.216
You boys are funny.

18:37.218 --> 18:38.568
I gonna step
to the ladies room.

18:38.570 --> 18:40.653
Linda?
I am right behind you.

18:40.655 --> 18:42.572
See you in an hour.
Ah.

18:42.574 --> 18:44.390
You're in better spirits, huh?

18:44.392 --> 18:46.693
It's an act.

18:46.695 --> 18:48.495
I don't want Linda
getting suspicious.

18:48.497 --> 18:49.996
Did you speak to your friend?

18:49.998 --> 18:51.664
Yeah, about that,
I didn't mean

18:51.666 --> 18:53.083
to get your hopes up, Danny.

18:53.085 --> 18:54.918
Look, I don't think
that thing's a good idea.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.236
What are you talking
about, Mick? Why not?

18:57.238 --> 19:00.090
He's not the kind of guy
you want to be involved with.

19:00.092 --> 19:02.175
Well, who is he?

19:02.177 --> 19:04.410
Danny, just let me
lend you the money.

19:04.412 --> 19:06.096
No.
Listen, it's not gonna

19:06.098 --> 19:08.264
come between us, okay?
You know what?

19:08.266 --> 19:10.433
I'll give it to you.
No strings.

19:10.435 --> 19:11.751
Consider it a gift. Done.

19:11.753 --> 19:13.970
So, I'm a charity case now,
is that it?

19:13.972 --> 19:15.638
Danny, you got it all wrong.

19:15.640 --> 19:16.639
Do I?

19:16.641 --> 19:18.274
Hmm?

19:18.276 --> 19:20.894
Sounds to me like you're saying
that you're the fancy big shot

19:20.896 --> 19:23.613
and I'm the guy looking
for a handout here.

19:23.615 --> 19:25.264
That's not
what I'm saying at all.

19:25.266 --> 19:29.202
Mick, just introduce me
to the guy.

19:29.204 --> 19:31.571
Let me figure it out
for myself, okay?

19:31.573 --> 19:32.872
Make the connection.

19:32.874 --> 19:35.375
Look, I got into this jam
on my own.

19:35.377 --> 19:37.994
Danny, look at me.

19:37.996 --> 19:40.497
We're not talking
about hanging some drywall

19:40.499 --> 19:42.499
for some extra bucks.

19:42.501 --> 19:44.167
You understand what I'm saying?

19:44.169 --> 19:45.835
Yeah, I do.

19:45.837 --> 19:48.121
You're okay with that?

19:48.123 --> 19:50.289
It's the only shot I got, Mick.

19:53.511 --> 19:56.096
All right.

19:56.098 --> 19:58.431
Call you tomorrow.
We'll sit down and talk.

19:58.433 --> 19:59.466
Okay?

19:59.468 --> 20:01.267
Okay.

20:03.687 --> 20:05.071
Okay, whatever he says,

20:05.073 --> 20:07.574
you make sure
you get it on tape.

20:07.576 --> 20:08.775
On tape? Whoa.

20:08.777 --> 20:10.527
Nobody said anything to me
about wearing a wire.

20:10.529 --> 20:11.811
Well, he wants
to meet in an hour.

20:11.813 --> 20:13.329
We have no lead time
to wire the place.

20:13.331 --> 20:14.313
It's too risky.

20:14.315 --> 20:15.648
And so is me walking
into the church

20:15.650 --> 20:17.584
with that thing
stuck to my chest.

20:17.586 --> 20:18.868
He's your friend.
He trusts you.

20:18.870 --> 20:21.671
He may look stupid,
but he's actually pretty smart.

20:21.673 --> 20:22.755
He's not smarter than you.

20:22.757 --> 20:24.323
You know how to play him.

20:24.325 --> 20:25.508
Besides, we'll be
right around the corner.

20:25.510 --> 20:26.826
One word from you,

20:26.828 --> 20:28.178
and we'll storm the place
like it's Normandy.

20:28.180 --> 20:29.712
Normandy was a bloodbath.

20:29.714 --> 20:31.948
Not my best analogy.

20:31.950 --> 20:34.968
But you got my word,
we'll take care of you.

20:34.970 --> 20:36.686
I'll take care
of myself, thanks.

20:36.688 --> 20:38.888
Give me the wire.

21:02.997 --> 21:04.664
What are we doing
here, Mickey?

21:04.666 --> 21:07.300
Christmastime.

21:07.302 --> 21:09.636
I love coming to church
this time of year.

21:09.638 --> 21:11.337
Right.
Why, you got the creeps?

21:11.339 --> 21:12.555
Well, yeah, a little bit.

21:12.557 --> 21:16.426
Me and you here like this,
it's a little creepy.

21:17.261 --> 21:20.980
It looks... smaller,
doesn't it?

21:20.982 --> 21:22.949
I don't know.
I'm here all the time.

21:22.951 --> 21:24.300
Looks the same to me.

21:24.302 --> 21:26.486
I remember
being... terrified

21:26.488 --> 21:29.222
coming in
here as a kid.

21:29.224 --> 21:30.423
(clicks tongue)

21:30.425 --> 21:33.910
Really felt the eyes
of God on you, didn't you?

21:33.912 --> 21:36.362
Yeah. Yeah, tell me about it.

21:36.364 --> 21:39.065
You, um... want
to go get a slice?

21:39.067 --> 21:41.117
No, in a minute.
Let's talk.

21:41.119 --> 21:42.619
We're gonna talk here?

21:42.621 --> 21:44.921
No, not here. Up there.

21:44.923 --> 21:47.406
Up... there?
What? Like old times.

21:47.408 --> 21:50.593
When we were altar
boys. But first...

21:50.595 --> 21:53.429
(exhales)
The new millennium.

21:53.431 --> 21:56.799
Huh, Danny? Eyes and
ears everywhere, and...

21:56.801 --> 21:59.969
what we have to discuss today,
best kept between friends.

21:59.971 --> 22:01.921
Yeah. Of course.

22:01.923 --> 22:04.140
Thank you.
Thanks.

22:06.777 --> 22:08.928
What are you doing?

22:08.930 --> 22:12.031
No offense, Danny,
you're a cop.

22:12.033 --> 22:12.865
And?

22:12.867 --> 22:14.734
And... I would be stupid

22:14.736 --> 22:16.769
not to take precautions.

22:16.771 --> 22:19.539
Come on.
You want to pat me down?

22:19.541 --> 22:21.157
Well, I don't want to.

22:21.159 --> 22:22.792
I'm not wearing a wire, Mickey.

22:22.794 --> 22:24.294
Then you won't
mind showing me.

22:24.296 --> 22:27.797
Since when is my word
not good enough for you?

22:27.799 --> 22:29.165
Come on, Danny.

22:29.167 --> 22:30.950
Your word's
good enough for me.

22:30.952 --> 22:33.052
We're gonna be discussing
third parties,

22:33.054 --> 22:36.472
and I'm afraid your word,
not good enough for them.

22:36.474 --> 22:37.674
So, may I?

22:42.296 --> 22:43.680
Of course.

22:50.321 --> 22:51.904
All right, okay,
let's talk.

23:11.914 --> 23:12.997
What the hell happened?

23:12.999 --> 23:14.165
Why didn't we hear anything
on the wire?

23:14.167 --> 23:16.167
'Cause I took this
damn thing off

23:16.169 --> 23:18.035
before I even walked in
the door, that's why.

23:18.037 --> 23:19.287
And it's a good thing.

23:19.289 --> 23:21.205
Otherwise, you'd be at
a cop funeral right now.

23:21.207 --> 23:23.474
You pulled the wire and still
went through with the sit-down?

23:23.476 --> 23:25.927
Yeah, and Mickey said enough
to incriminate himself.

23:25.929 --> 23:27.462
That's great.

23:27.464 --> 23:30.047
Too bad it's of no use to us--
it's your word against his.

23:30.049 --> 23:32.517
You know they make apps
for everything these days?

23:33.719 --> 23:35.520
You recorded it on your phone?

23:35.522 --> 23:37.605
He took my phone
before I sat down,

23:37.607 --> 23:41.275
but... I had a second phone
stashed in my ankle holster,

23:41.277 --> 23:43.778
and I recorded every word.

23:43.780 --> 23:45.346
You happy?

23:47.065 --> 23:48.649
Nice work, Detective.

23:48.651 --> 23:50.568
Yeah, some victory. Whoo-hoo.

23:54.206 --> 23:56.290
I'll tell you how
to beat this thing.

23:56.292 --> 23:57.291
Ignore it.

23:57.293 --> 23:59.293
Tell every cop
to go out there

23:59.295 --> 24:01.329
and do the job, like
they've done before.

24:01.331 --> 24:04.165
Great idea. And open up each
and every one to a lawsuit, Pop.

24:04.167 --> 24:07.101
What they gonna do,
sue 35,000 cops?

24:07.103 --> 24:08.970
Nonsense.

24:08.972 --> 24:12.373
Let this mess crumble
under its own weight.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.176
And if it doesn't,
you're carrying a mortgage,

24:14.177 --> 24:15.393
you're saving
for your kid's college.

24:15.395 --> 24:17.094
The legal fees alone would
wipe you out.

24:17.096 --> 24:20.598
Pop, what kind of a PC orders
his people to break the law?

24:20.600 --> 24:22.266
The judge's rule was wrong.

24:22.268 --> 24:23.518
That's an opinion.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.236
But the fact is
the judge has ruled,

24:25.238 --> 24:27.522
and we have to live with it,
like it or not.

24:27.524 --> 24:29.407
Well, I don't like it,
and neither should you.

24:29.409 --> 24:31.509
I didn't say I did.

24:35.397 --> 24:38.616
So, as a cop,

24:38.618 --> 24:40.418
where do you come down on this?

24:40.420 --> 24:42.670
As a cop?

24:42.672 --> 24:43.737
(sighs)

24:43.739 --> 24:46.407
Professionals are valued
for their instincts,

24:46.409 --> 24:48.259
their ability to react,

24:48.261 --> 24:51.262
whether you're a cop
or an NFL quarterback.

24:51.264 --> 24:54.432
I can think of no other
profession where you're told

24:54.434 --> 24:57.751
to bench your talents, and then
you're penalized if you don't.

24:57.753 --> 25:02.106
Honestly, this ruling makes
the job ten times harder.

25:02.108 --> 25:03.090
But?

25:03.092 --> 25:05.443
But I think
the judge has a point.

25:05.445 --> 25:08.029
I think Stop and Frisk
is an effective instrument

25:08.031 --> 25:09.430
that started to be overused.

25:09.432 --> 25:11.732
Cops going too far with it.

25:11.734 --> 25:12.950
That's part of it.

25:12.952 --> 25:15.236
There's something else?

25:15.238 --> 25:17.238
A lot of cops started
to get lazy.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.291
A few years ago, Stop and Frisk
was just one of many ways

25:20.293 --> 25:22.159
that we could get guns
off the streets.

25:22.161 --> 25:23.327
It was a potent tool.

25:23.329 --> 25:26.631
So potent that bosses
started to encourage us

25:26.633 --> 25:30.001
to abandon all other means
in favor of this one method.

25:30.003 --> 25:33.554
So the shortcut became
the favorite route.

25:35.007 --> 25:37.791
And I'm the boss
of those bosses.

25:37.793 --> 25:39.460
Didn't mean it like that.

25:39.462 --> 25:41.295
Sure, you did.

25:41.297 --> 25:44.131
You're saying this falls
on my shoulders.

25:45.934 --> 25:47.968
And you're right.

25:51.990 --> 25:54.375
(sighs)

26:06.288 --> 26:08.339
Hey, Danny boy!

26:08.341 --> 26:09.490
Mickey.

26:09.492 --> 26:10.675
What's the matter?

26:10.677 --> 26:14.512
Oh, no, don't tell me
you're betting again.

26:14.514 --> 26:17.048
No betting, Mickey.
No?

26:17.050 --> 26:19.850
In fact, there was never
any gambling trouble at all.

26:19.852 --> 26:21.352
I'm not following.

26:21.354 --> 26:23.688
It was a play, Mick.

26:23.690 --> 26:25.473
What are you telling me?

26:25.475 --> 26:27.892
I'm telling you I got
a recording of you

26:27.894 --> 26:30.478
offering me money for sensitive
NYPD information.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.680
Danny, listen to me.

26:32.682 --> 26:34.815
Some kind of joke,
it's not funny.

26:34.817 --> 26:36.517
It's no joke.
It's real and it's happening,

26:36.519 --> 26:38.703
so do me a favor, get your hands
out of your pockets,

26:38.705 --> 26:40.287
get 'em up in the air.
Come on.

26:40.289 --> 26:42.406
You framed me?
Come on, Mick.

26:42.408 --> 26:45.859
You framed me, Danny,
your oldest friend?

26:45.861 --> 26:48.379
You set me up?

26:49.631 --> 26:50.881
Turn around.

26:50.883 --> 26:53.134
Okay, okay.

27:01.810 --> 27:04.044
(both grunting)

27:28.036 --> 27:31.088
Give it up.
Give it up!

27:37.796 --> 27:39.714
I don't kill anybody.

27:39.716 --> 27:41.966
Oh, so that's supposed
to make what you do okay, hmm?

27:41.968 --> 27:45.419
I'm just a businessman, Danny.

27:45.421 --> 27:48.556
I'm good at making deals,
that's all.

27:48.558 --> 27:50.424
What kind of deals you making,
huh, Mick?

27:50.426 --> 27:52.777
Hmm? Drugs, gambling,
prostitution, what?

27:52.779 --> 27:54.195
Do you even hear yourself?!

27:54.197 --> 27:55.929
No, no, I don't do
any of that stuff.

27:55.931 --> 27:57.264
I'm not involved
with any of that.

27:57.266 --> 27:58.532
I put people together.

27:58.534 --> 28:00.868
I buy and sell companies,
I move some money around.

28:00.870 --> 28:03.537
That's it, okay? I got nothing
to do with anybody getting hurt.

28:03.539 --> 28:05.105
But they <i>do</i> get hurt!

28:05.107 --> 28:07.408
And if it's not you,
it's your associates,

28:07.410 --> 28:08.876
which makes you just as guilty!

28:08.878 --> 28:10.127
Don't you get that?!

28:15.383 --> 28:18.452
What the hell
happened to you, huh?

28:18.454 --> 28:19.970
Why did you do this?

28:19.972 --> 28:23.924
I didn't know
I <i>was</i> doing it, Danny.

28:23.926 --> 28:26.560
I was just a young hotshot
good at making deals.

28:26.562 --> 28:28.896
These guys saw it,
they paid me a premium

28:28.898 --> 28:31.816
to do the exact same thing
on a larger scale with them.

28:31.818 --> 28:35.686
By the time I realized
who they were...

28:35.688 --> 28:38.072
it's too late.

28:41.493 --> 28:43.310
(sighs)

28:45.146 --> 28:48.365
Well... maybe it's not too late.

28:50.318 --> 28:51.485
How bad is it?

28:51.487 --> 28:52.787
Ten years bad.

28:52.789 --> 28:54.371
Maybe 15.

28:54.373 --> 28:56.257
Unless you're willing
to work with me.

28:57.292 --> 28:58.509
Don't even say it.

28:58.511 --> 29:00.211
You got to testify
against them, Mick.

29:00.213 --> 29:01.045
Not possible.

29:01.047 --> 29:02.830
You got to put these animals

29:02.832 --> 29:04.632
where they belong, behind bars.

29:04.634 --> 29:06.851
Danny, you know.

29:06.853 --> 29:08.936
I speak one word
against the Vasquez family,

29:08.938 --> 29:11.388
and that's as good as me
putting Connie and the boys

29:11.390 --> 29:12.807
in a body bag myself.

29:12.809 --> 29:14.475
Mick, we'll protect you.

29:14.477 --> 29:16.310
We'll put you and Connie
and the boys

29:16.312 --> 29:17.978
in witness protection
where you'll be safe!

29:17.980 --> 29:19.230
At least you'll have a chance!

29:19.232 --> 29:21.482
And then what?

29:21.484 --> 29:24.034
Connie never sees her mother
ever again?

29:25.821 --> 29:28.405
My boys have
to give up my name?

29:28.407 --> 29:31.242
And become a couple of nobodies
living in the middle of nowhere.

29:31.244 --> 29:33.828
Yeah. Maybe you'd rather

29:33.830 --> 29:36.247
they just stare at you through
six inches of Plexiglas

29:36.249 --> 29:37.798
for the next ten years, huh?

29:37.800 --> 29:39.867
(knocking)

29:39.869 --> 29:41.252
What?

29:41.254 --> 29:43.420
My name is Charles Bryce.

29:43.422 --> 29:44.705
I'm the attorney
of record,

29:44.707 --> 29:47.224
and my client has
nothing more to say.

29:52.180 --> 29:53.848
That's how it's gonna be, Mick?

29:53.850 --> 29:55.266
Nothing to say?

29:55.268 --> 29:57.902
Not a word.

30:00.322 --> 30:01.822
Turn around.

30:01.824 --> 30:03.490
(handcuffs clicking)

30:06.945 --> 30:09.062
Get him out of here.

30:25.079 --> 30:26.213
What?

30:26.215 --> 30:28.248
Feds are requesting
a million dollars bail.

30:28.250 --> 30:29.516
A million dollars?

30:29.518 --> 30:31.468
Well, he just moved here.
He's a flight risk.

30:31.470 --> 30:33.220
And trust me,
it's a good thing.

30:33.222 --> 30:34.254
Why is that?

30:34.256 --> 30:36.357
Vasquez family put a hit out
on Mickey.

30:36.359 --> 30:37.858
You got to be kidding me.

30:37.860 --> 30:39.426
I knew this was a terrible idea.

30:39.428 --> 30:40.895
They think he's talking to us.

30:40.897 --> 30:42.196
Well, obviously,
he's not talking.

30:42.198 --> 30:43.480
You just heard for yourself.

30:43.482 --> 30:44.615
Well, they don't know that.

30:44.617 --> 30:46.066
And they wouldn't believe it
if we told them.

30:46.068 --> 30:47.902
We can't help this guy
'cause he won't talk,

30:47.904 --> 30:50.103
and they want to whack him
'cause they think he is?

30:50.105 --> 30:51.655
I know.
You know?

30:51.657 --> 30:53.207
That's all you got
to offer-- you know?

30:53.209 --> 30:55.275
I want two marshals
on him at all times.

30:55.277 --> 30:56.377
If he goes to take a leak,

30:56.379 --> 30:57.578
I want one of them
flushing the...

30:57.580 --> 30:59.330
It's already being
taken care of.

30:59.332 --> 31:01.799
If he gets whacked,
it's on me.

31:01.801 --> 31:03.884
Then I'm gonna be on you.

31:09.925 --> 31:11.976
FRANK:
Over there.

31:11.978 --> 31:14.395
Those three.

31:15.981 --> 31:18.131
Why are we here, Frank?

31:18.133 --> 31:20.684
The one in the ball cap and
the blue jacket. You see him?

31:20.686 --> 31:21.969
I do.

31:21.971 --> 31:23.854
FRANK:
Two cell phones going--

31:23.856 --> 31:26.690
one for calls,
the other for texts.

31:26.692 --> 31:28.409
I don't think he
runs a hedge fund.

31:28.411 --> 31:30.811
There's no law against
carrying two cell phones, Frank.

31:30.813 --> 31:32.112
No, there isn't.

31:32.114 --> 31:34.748
But you see the way
he keeps shifting his weight

31:34.750 --> 31:36.149
and tapping his hip?

31:39.254 --> 31:40.788
Okay. So?

31:40.790 --> 31:43.874
Well, a loaded pistol
weighs about two pounds.

31:43.876 --> 31:45.325
These guys don't use holsters,

31:45.327 --> 31:48.262
so it's just
kind of loose weight

31:48.264 --> 31:50.831
with only the elastic
in his waistband

31:50.833 --> 31:52.967
or a skinny belt to secure it.

31:52.969 --> 31:54.468
So that man's carrying a gun?

31:54.470 --> 31:59.006
My 30-plus years doing
police work says yes.

31:59.008 --> 32:01.058
He is carrying
a gun and therefore

32:01.060 --> 32:04.278
likely to be involved
in dealing drugs.

32:04.280 --> 32:07.347
Given the neighborhood,
probably crack.

32:07.349 --> 32:10.284
So what are we going
to do about it?

32:10.286 --> 32:12.486
Nothing.

32:12.488 --> 32:15.039
Frank, I got it.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.323
Lesson over.

32:16.325 --> 32:18.826
If he's carrying a gun,
someone needs to stop him.

32:18.828 --> 32:20.193
Well, what if I'm wrong?

32:20.195 --> 32:22.713
What if it's just a pint
of vodka he keeps checking?

32:22.715 --> 32:24.832
But you say your experience
tells you it's a gun.

32:24.834 --> 32:26.667
It does.

32:26.669 --> 32:29.303
But I am not infallible.

32:29.305 --> 32:31.055
And he is black.

32:32.874 --> 32:37.311
If I'm wrong and stop him,
I open myself up to a lawsuit.

32:37.313 --> 32:38.762
But if somebody makes a call,

32:38.764 --> 32:41.732
then it gives the police just
cause to stop and question him.

32:41.734 --> 32:44.935
That's right.

32:44.937 --> 32:47.721
But unless and until it does,

32:47.723 --> 32:51.608
no cop who cares about
his pension will go near him.

32:55.113 --> 32:57.281
We're done here.

33:04.589 --> 33:06.623
Your medicine working yet?

33:06.625 --> 33:07.758
(sighs)

33:07.760 --> 33:10.077
Aw, Gramps.

33:10.079 --> 33:13.597
I'm either sending my buddy
to jail or to his grave.

33:13.599 --> 33:16.383
They don't make medicine
strong enough to deal with that.

33:16.385 --> 33:19.219
You didn't do anything
but your job.

33:19.221 --> 33:20.254
Right.

33:20.256 --> 33:22.556
Mickey brought this on himself.

33:22.558 --> 33:26.927
So why do I feel
like a piece of crap then?

33:26.929 --> 33:29.262
'Cause you cared for him.

33:29.264 --> 33:32.783
Yeah. Well, sometimes I think
I should've been a firefighter.

33:32.785 --> 33:34.618
(chuckles)

33:34.620 --> 33:37.905
You just learning
this is a thankless job?

33:37.907 --> 33:40.107
(cell phone ringing)

33:43.328 --> 33:45.329
What now, Sutton?

33:45.331 --> 33:47.331
Mickey just made bail.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.882
How the hell did he do that?

33:48.884 --> 33:50.617
It wasn't him.

33:50.619 --> 33:53.303
A Vasquez soldier posted it
for him.

33:55.673 --> 33:58.008
Vasquez family
just bailed Mickey out.

33:58.010 --> 34:00.644
There's only one reason
they'd want to spring him.

34:03.848 --> 34:06.650
Careful.

34:12.940 --> 34:13.907
Connie, where's Mickey?

34:13.909 --> 34:14.741
What do you want?

34:14.743 --> 34:15.976
I need to talk to Mickey.

34:15.978 --> 34:17.777
He's in jail, where you put him.

34:17.780 --> 34:19.279
Come on. You and I both know
they bailed him out,

34:19.281 --> 34:20.246
so knock it off.

34:20.248 --> 34:21.364
So what if they did?

34:21.367 --> 34:22.783
That's what friends do.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.650
You think they're his friends.
They're not, Connie.

34:24.652 --> 34:25.652
They think he talked.

34:25.654 --> 34:26.753
He didn't tell you a thing.

34:26.755 --> 34:28.288
I know that, but they don't.

34:28.290 --> 34:30.157
If they bailed him out,
it's 'cause they think he sang

34:30.159 --> 34:31.341
and they're gonna hurt him.

34:32.677 --> 34:35.094
(exhales)
I...

34:35.097 --> 34:36.679
Connie, look at me.

34:38.099 --> 34:39.716
You know I'm not lying.

34:39.717 --> 34:41.101
Where is he?

34:42.937 --> 34:44.804
I don't... I don't know
where he is.

34:44.806 --> 34:47.440
I honestly don't.

34:47.443 --> 34:50.610
He texted me a while ago,
but it's just gibberish.

34:50.612 --> 34:52.512
I think he pocket-dialed me.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.116
It's in ob.

34:56.951 --> 34:59.570
"Taking me under the bridge.
I...

34:59.572 --> 35:01.288
I love you."

35:01.290 --> 35:03.323
What?

35:03.325 --> 35:04.908
I got to... I got to go.

35:07.745 --> 35:09.163
This is Detective Reagan.

35:09.165 --> 35:12.166
I'm gonna need
a 10-85 forthwith.

35:25.305 --> 35:27.973
(Mickey grunting)

35:27.975 --> 35:30.258
No, no, no! You got it wrong.

35:30.260 --> 35:32.427
You got it wrong! No!
Shut up.

35:40.287 --> 35:43.455
No. No.

35:43.457 --> 35:44.606
Don't do this.

35:44.608 --> 35:47.126
You got it wrong.
You guys got it wrong.

35:47.128 --> 35:49.277
I didn't do anything!

35:49.279 --> 35:51.413
I'm begging you.
Don't do this.

35:51.415 --> 35:54.282
Police! Drop it!

36:02.642 --> 36:05.728
(grunting)

36:11.017 --> 36:13.235
(grunting)

36:16.973 --> 36:17.856
Twelve.

36:18.158 --> 36:19.074
Thirteen.

36:21.310 --> 36:22.644
(gunshot)
Fourteen.

36:22.996 --> 36:23.862
Fifteen.

36:25.782 --> 36:28.117
One in the chamber.

36:28.119 --> 36:29.284
Drop the gun!

36:29.286 --> 36:30.869
(gun clicking)

36:32.589 --> 36:34.623
Learn how to count.

36:34.625 --> 36:37.209
(sirens approaching)

36:41.965 --> 36:43.599
Come on.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.768
(sirens wailing)

36:48.438 --> 36:50.022
Come on.

36:50.024 --> 36:51.190
(coughing)

36:51.192 --> 36:53.559
Get this piece of crap
out of here.

36:58.565 --> 37:00.849
This is what's gonna happen.

37:00.851 --> 37:04.787
You're gonna make a change,
you're gonna set things right

37:04.789 --> 37:06.354
and then, maybe then,

37:06.356 --> 37:09.958
I'll consider calling you
a friend again.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.910
(sighs)

37:11.912 --> 37:13.579
I got to testify.

37:13.581 --> 37:15.130
Yeah, you got to testify.

37:15.132 --> 37:17.066
I'll be there
the whole time

37:17.068 --> 37:18.634
making sure
you don't screw it up

37:18.636 --> 37:20.469
like you screwed up
everything else.

37:20.471 --> 37:22.755
And after that?

37:25.175 --> 37:29.478
After that, you start a new life
with Connie and the boys.

37:38.354 --> 37:40.722
I want to say something, but...

37:40.724 --> 37:43.609
"thank you" doesn't seem
like enough.

37:43.611 --> 37:45.944
It's not enough.

37:47.831 --> 37:49.782
Come on.

37:49.784 --> 37:52.000
Let's go.

37:54.070 --> 37:56.171
Come on.

38:00.043 --> 38:01.844
Ten-hut!

38:10.603 --> 38:13.272
At ease.

38:18.761 --> 38:22.030
There's a lot of talk
around this precinct

38:22.032 --> 38:25.451
and throughout the department

38:25.453 --> 38:28.153
about Stop, Question and Frisk.

38:30.490 --> 38:33.876
Many of you believe
that the judge's ruling

38:33.878 --> 38:36.378
is unfair,

38:36.380 --> 38:38.797
even dangerous.

38:38.799 --> 38:42.468
Here is my take on the ruling.

38:42.470 --> 38:44.470
It is the law.

38:44.472 --> 38:46.972
And because it is the law,

38:46.974 --> 38:50.309
we damn sure are gonna see
that it is carried out.

38:54.647 --> 38:58.684
Now, I know that's not
what many of you want to hear.

38:58.686 --> 39:00.135
And that's fine.

39:00.137 --> 39:02.354
You have a right
to your opinion...

39:03.189 --> 39:06.325
...when you are off duty.

39:06.327 --> 39:09.477
But when you come
through those doors

39:09.479 --> 39:13.248
and you put on that uniform,

39:13.250 --> 39:17.319
best check those opinions
in your locker.

39:22.125 --> 39:26.762
The real truth
about Stop, Question, and Frisk

39:26.764 --> 39:30.632
is that it is
a highly effective measure.

39:30.634 --> 39:33.969
And it has helped us take
a whole lot of bad guys

39:33.971 --> 39:35.871
off the street.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.359
But it is not

39:40.361 --> 39:43.612
the only tool on your belt.

39:43.614 --> 39:48.984
And it is not something
we are discarding altogether.

39:48.986 --> 39:51.519
And I can tell you

39:51.521 --> 39:55.457
that the mayor gets that.

39:58.628 --> 40:01.430
I need some help.

40:03.416 --> 40:05.367
I need you

40:05.369 --> 40:09.537
to do the job
you signed on to do.

40:12.842 --> 40:16.711
I will give you clear guidelines
so you can do that job.

40:16.713 --> 40:20.182
And I will...

40:21.251 --> 40:23.885
...always

40:23.887 --> 40:27.055
have your back.

40:27.057 --> 40:29.908
That is all.

40:29.910 --> 40:31.243
Ten-hut!

40:35.865 --> 40:37.366
When you were kids,
did you know

40:37.368 --> 40:40.035
that Mr. Patrick was gonna
turn out to be a criminal?

40:40.037 --> 40:43.422
No, I didn't know that.
We were just friends.

40:43.424 --> 40:44.339
I knew.

40:44.341 --> 40:45.424
Oh, come on, Pop.

40:45.426 --> 40:46.741
20/20 hindsight?

40:46.743 --> 40:48.460
Well, I did.

40:48.462 --> 40:50.762
Mickey Patrick was a born felon.

40:50.764 --> 40:51.797
Oh...

40:51.799 --> 40:52.914
Come on, Gramps.

40:52.916 --> 40:54.466
I didn't even how I
was gonna turn out,

40:54.468 --> 40:55.801
much less anyone else.

40:55.803 --> 40:56.802
None of us did.

40:56.804 --> 40:58.637
You thought you might
turn out sideways?

40:58.639 --> 40:59.921
No, I was an angel.

40:59.923 --> 41:01.390
I'm talking about
your Uncle Danny.

41:01.392 --> 41:04.426
Grandma always kept
a little bail fund for Danny

41:04.428 --> 41:06.812
in a mayonnaise jar
over the fridge.

41:06.814 --> 41:09.097
No, she did not.

41:10.199 --> 41:11.266
Your dad was
the type of guy

41:11.268 --> 41:12.284
that liked to know
everyone else's moves

41:12.286 --> 41:13.935
before he decided
on his own.

41:13.937 --> 41:16.321
Which is not a bad way to be,
and handy for a cop.

41:16.323 --> 41:17.456
Thanks.

41:17.458 --> 41:20.709
If you can stop yourself
from defining someone

41:20.711 --> 41:22.494
by their worst choices,

41:22.496 --> 41:25.631
you know, like your dad tries to
do, then you'll be a better man.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.215
I'm really loving this.

41:27.217 --> 41:28.216
(chuckles)

41:28.218 --> 41:30.085
But if a guy
commits a crime,

41:30.087 --> 41:31.336
isn't he a criminal?

41:31.338 --> 41:33.839
For that act, yes.

41:33.841 --> 41:35.807
But that's not all he is.

41:35.809 --> 41:38.226
Uh, okay.

41:38.228 --> 41:40.128
All right, Sean,

41:40.130 --> 41:43.148
what movie do we always watch
this time of year?

41:43.150 --> 41:44.399
<i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

41:44.401 --> 41:45.851
Okay, take Ebenezer Scrooge.

41:45.853 --> 41:48.987
He starts out a decent fellow,
then he gets cranky,

41:48.989 --> 41:52.807
then he gets downright mean,
then he gets scared,

41:52.809 --> 41:56.278
and then he tries
to bargain his way out,

41:56.280 --> 41:58.646
and then he ends up
all jolly and generous.

41:58.648 --> 42:01.533
So, Ebenezer Scrooge,
good guy or bad guy?

42:01.535 --> 42:02.534
Good?

42:02.536 --> 42:05.037
But he is bad
through most of the story.

42:05.039 --> 42:06.154
I say bad.

42:06.156 --> 42:08.340
Yeah, and when you call
someone a Scrooge,

42:08.342 --> 42:11.126
it means that they're cheap
in a mean sort of way.

42:11.128 --> 42:11.993
That's right.

42:11.995 --> 42:13.045
LINDA:
Yeah, but...

42:13.047 --> 42:14.179
when you watch the movie,

42:14.181 --> 42:16.181
you end up liking him
in the end.

42:16.183 --> 42:17.215
Also right.

42:17.217 --> 42:18.967
What you take away is up to you,

42:18.969 --> 42:22.187
makes you who you are in terms
of how you look at other people.

42:22.189 --> 42:24.523
Hmm.

42:24.525 --> 42:26.892
And there was no bail fund.

42:28.194 --> 42:30.729
You remember
that envelope full of cash

42:30.731 --> 42:33.231
that Mom gave you
on your 21st birthday?

42:33.233 --> 42:35.850
Yeah. Had a couple hundred bucks
in it.

42:35.852 --> 42:37.035
Bail fund.

42:37.037 --> 42:38.653
No, no, no. Mom told me

42:38.655 --> 42:40.989
it was docked allowance
from over the years.

42:40.991 --> 42:42.290
Yeah?
Yes.

42:42.292 --> 42:44.459
No. Bail fund.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.578
