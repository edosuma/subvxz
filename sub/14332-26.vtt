- AW, DAD, YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT,
AND WE NEVER WIN.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.705
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THIS TIME
IS GONNA BE ANY DIFFERENT?

01:12.772 --> 01:15.942

I ACTUALLY BOUGHT A TICKET.

WE CAN BUY A HOUSE
WITH A SWIMMING POOL

01:50.343 --> 01:51.744
AND A TENNIS COURT.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.413
AND THEN I CAN PAY SOMEONE
TO TEACH ME

01:53.480 --> 01:55.582
HOW TO SWIM AND PLAY TENNIS!

01:55.648 --> 01:58.251

OF ALL THEIR JOY.

03:18.298 --> 03:19.566
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:19.632 --> 03:21.467
IF THE TURNERS DERIVE HAPPINESS
FROM A GOOD PET,

03:21.534 --> 03:23.770
THEN THEY SHOULD DERIVE MISERY
FROM AN EVIL ONE.

03:23.836 --> 03:25.538

WHY ARE YOU WORKING
AT A PET STORE?

[gasping]
AM I DEAD?

04:12.819 --> 04:14.921
IT'S DIFFICULT TO TELL
BECAUSE I'M ALREADY BLUE.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.456
AND AFTER ALL, YOU'RE HERE.

04:16.522 --> 04:19.158
- RELAX, I DON'T HAVE YOU
SCHEDULED FOR A WHILE.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.459
OH, THIS IS FUN.

04:20.526 --> 04:22.028
YOU'RE GONNA PERISH
ON THE TOILET.

I'M NEVER GOING POTTY AGAIN!

04:25.832 --> 04:28.301
ANYWAY, WHAT OTHER PETS
DO YOU HAVE?

- WELL, THERE'S BERNIE.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.471
- OOH, HE'S COLORFUL!

04:31.537 --> 04:33.473
WHY DO YOU CALL HIM BERNIE?

04:46.452 --> 04:48.021
WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM?

04:48.087 --> 04:50.456
- WE CALL HIM ANTI-SPARKY.

04:50.523 --> 04:52.058
- NOT VERY CREATIVE,

04:52.125 --> 04:54.227
BUT AS LONG AS HIS NAME'S
NOT BERNIE, I'M GOOD.

04:54.293 --> 04:56.062
SO WHAT DOES HE EAT?

04:56.129 --> 04:58.831
- THE QUESTION IS,
WHO DOES HE EAT?

04:58.898 --> 05:01.334
- I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU
FOR DINNER.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.202

AND BY THAT,
I MEAN I'LL TAKE HIM.

05:13.846 --> 05:16.149
I'LL SWITCH THIS MONSTER
FOR THE TURNERS' DOG

05:16.215 --> 05:19.285
AND BRING MISERY TO THEIR LIVES
FOREVER.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.722
- THAT'LL BE $100.

05:22.789 --> 05:26.492
- UH, THAT'S ABOUT $100 MORE
THAN I WAS PREPARED TO PAY.

05:26.559 --> 05:30.329
- NO, I GIVE YOU THE MONEY
TO TAKE THIS BEAST OFF MY HANDS.

05:30.396 --> 05:32.198

05:40.673 --> 05:42.909
IT'S GONNA BE
AN UNCOMFORTABLE TRIP HOME.

- SHOULDN'T YOU BE DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK, TIMMY?

05:49.115 --> 05:50.316
- I ALREADY DID IT.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.251
ACTUALLY, SPARKY DID IT FOR ME.

TIMMY, I'M NOT SURE
THIS IS RIGHT.

06:04.230 --> 06:05.164
- WHATEVER.

06:05.231 --> 06:06.165
THE POINT IS,

06:06.232 --> 06:07.166
SPARKY DID MY HOMEWORK

06:07.233 --> 06:08.167
SO I DON'T HAVE TO.

06:08.234 --> 06:09.669
HE REALLY IS THE BEST DOG EVER.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.704
- OH, TIMMY!

06:11.771 --> 06:14.440
THAT SPARKY REALLY IS
THE BEST DOG EVER.

06:14.507 --> 06:15.808
HE BROUGHT ME THE PAPER

06:15.875 --> 06:18.111
AND THIS FANCY DIAMOND GRILL
FOR MY TEETH.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.279

06:56.816 --> 06:58.885
THE OTHERS ARE:
NEVER LOOK ME IN THE EYE

06:58.951 --> 07:01.087
AND NEVER RAISE YOUR VOICE
AT ME.

07:01.154 --> 07:02.288

07:02.355 --> 07:03.890
- YES.
- WHAT?

- I DON'T SEE ANYTHING.

CAN I TELL YOU
ABOUT MY DIABOLICAL PLAN

07:17.703 --> 07:19.372
TO GET RID OF SPARKY?

07:19.438 --> 07:20.940
- I ASSUME
YOU'RE GONNA DESTROY HIM,

07:21.007 --> 07:23.176
PERHAPS BY LURING HIM
INTO A VAT OF ACID.

07:23.242 --> 07:25.745

THROW A TENNIS BALL REALLY FAR

07:25.812 --> 07:27.513
SO IT'LL TAKE HIM WEEKS
TO FETCH IT.

07:28.848 --> 07:30.049
- I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO THROW IT.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.853

AT WATER PILATES.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.497
AND IF YOU'RE REALLY
THE ANTI-ME,

07:44.564 --> 07:46.599
THEN YOU'RE BOTH PROBABLY
