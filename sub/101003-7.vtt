-Yes, I did.

11:29.271 --> 11:32.650
He's about to learn that you don't mess

Shut door before chickens get out.

11:35.528 --> 11:36.737

My name Slutskaya. We share office now.
Mr. Mayor, he say so.

11:42.618 --> 11:46.038
So, uh, you think you might want
to change your mind about that vote?

11:46.622 --> 11:48.708
Or do you need to learn the hard way?

11:48.791 --> 11:50.710
I ain't learning dick.

11:51.627 --> 11:55.548
So be it. I'm about to make things
very hard for you.

13:09.705 --> 13:10.539
Well--

13:10.623 --> 13:13.709
I got a brother who could use a job
with the parks department.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.545
You know, one of those
where he just sits in a truck all day?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.672
Maybe give him a badge and a gun.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.300
Rosie, you think you could name
my street after me?

13:21.383 --> 13:23.552
It would make it easier
to tell people where I live.

13:23.636 --> 13:26.806
Now, listen here,
it may be a little more difficult

13:26.889 --> 13:30.017
than I initially expected
to fulfill some of my promises.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.352
So you can't do anything?

13:31.435 --> 13:32.645
Well, I didn't say that.

He's not doing nothing for us.

Well, how could you say that?
I'm busting my ass for you!

And everything's gotten worse!
Hydrants, garbage.

Shit, Rosie. What the fuck
are you doing over there?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
[stammers] Well, it's not me.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.795
The mayor's fucking me over
by trying to make me rich.

13:57.878 --> 14:01.715
Wh-- He wants to knock down the library
and put up a dog track.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.052
Dog track?
That's what the fuck I'm talking about!

14:05.135 --> 14:07.429
I'm trying to do something important
for the community here.

-Except lie to us!

Yeah! We sing better than his ass,
but he's uptown fucking Berry Gordy.

Chauncey, don't act like that
in front of the kids. They look up to you.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.108
Where's that inspirational man
who was running for alderman?

15:01.191 --> 15:03.485
He got hit by a streetcar named reality.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.739
Well, the whole reason you ran
is because you knew how corrupt it was

15:06.822 --> 15:08.198
and you wanted to fix it.

15:08.282 --> 15:10.242
[stammers] The whole reason I ran

15:10.326 --> 15:12.453
is because you
told me to stop complaining about things!

15:12.536 --> 15:14.163
Well, that certainly didn't work.

15:14.246 --> 15:17.541
Well, fine then! Next time
I'll just keep it all boiling inside of me

15:17.625 --> 15:21.003

the top of my head like a volcano!

15:21.086 --> 15:22.671
-Is that what you want?
-No!

15:22.755 --> 15:25.007
Well, then get used
to hearing me complain!

15:25.090 --> 15:29.637
I love you. I would die for all of you.
Now get off my ass! Goodbye!

15:33.933 --> 15:36.435
Forgot my tuna salad and Pop-Tarts.

Now, Rosie, you gonna have
to make it fast. I'm in between shows.

I'm spending every waking second
trying to keep my campaign promises,

15:48.572 --> 15:51.116
but the mayor is roadblocking me
at every turn.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.077
And now my own friends are against me!

15:53.160 --> 15:54.787
Patience, my son.

It took Jesus 24 tries
before he could walk on water.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.751
That's in the verses you don't see.

16:00.834 --> 16:04.296
I need your help now.
The mayor respects you.

16:04.380 --> 16:07.132
You're the only one that can help me
get this turned around.

16:07.216 --> 16:11.261
Rosie, I've been praying
you would come to me.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.555
We're going to get everything you want.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.683
You will feel the love of your flock again

16:15.766 --> 16:18.227
because you are going to raise
the community from the dead!

16:18.310 --> 16:20.354

-And bring it back

Shit. You're in the pocket
with those crooks too?

The Bible says you run
with the dogs or from the dogs.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.218
-What book is that?
-The book of one-tenth

16:51.301 --> 16:54.054
of all popcorn sales at the dog track.

16:54.471 --> 16:57.891
I will never sell my soul
for one-tenth of anything!

17:07.234 --> 17:09.361
This sweater's making me itchy.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.864
I don't care. I paid $18 for it,

17:11.947 --> 17:15.200
so you're gonna do $30 worth
of dancing in it before we take it back.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.161
Welcome to <i>Funk Implosion.</i>

You can go back to work now.

the sanitary napkins in the ladies' room?

with more sense than you.

maybe I should go back to school.

Don't leave me, Larry!

Okay, you ride shotgun.

Well, that was certainly
a collection of noise.

This next tune is "Super Soul Brother,"

19:00.764 --> 19:06.270
followed by a group called Parliament
with "Tear the Roof off the Sucker."

19:06.895 --> 19:08.856
Well, at least
they're not burning it down.

22:16.793 --> 22:20.130
Mayor Tangenti, how are you
this lovely morning, huh?

22:20.547 --> 22:25.385
Oh, the mayor's office,
jewel of City Hall. [giggles]

22:25.469 --> 22:26.803
You're in a good mood today.

22:26.887 --> 22:30.974
Well, I'm happy because it's time
to vote... on my dog track.

22:31.558 --> 22:33.602
This is my counter-proposal.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.855
It designates a public plot of vacant land
for the dog track.

22:36.938 --> 22:41.193
The proceeds will go back to my community
to make their lives better.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.780
You get your seventh vote
when you give me this.

22:44.863 --> 22:46.865
Nice speech, nice presentation.

22:46.948 --> 22:49.326
But I already got my seventh vote.

22:49.910 --> 22:52.162
Alderman Liebowitz from Little Tel Aviv.

22:52.245 --> 22:55.248
Thanks, Mr. Mayor.
These steaks will go great

22:55.332 --> 22:58.752
with those garage door openers
you gave me last month.

22:58.835 --> 23:02.089
Sorry, Rosie.
You snooze, you lose to Jews.

23:02.172 --> 23:05.258
The library is out. The dog track is in.

23:05.342 --> 23:10.514
But I had a nice gabagool for lunch,
so I'm feeling generous.

23:10.597 --> 23:13.558
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll take care of one of these for you.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.520
And if you learn to play ball,
I'll do another one...

23:16.603 --> 23:18.230
uh...

23:18.313 --> 23:19.606
maybe next year.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.818
-What do you say?
-[grunts] Fine.

23:22.901 --> 23:24.569
You started a little slow,

23:24.986 --> 23:26.238
but you're learning.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.539
[groans] Maybe next year.

23:39.876 --> 23:44.172
Daddy, they fixed the fire hydrants.
We got our water pressure back.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.426
I can almost see through it.

23:47.509 --> 23:49.052
Maybe one day you will.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.512
Another hard day, huh?

23:50.595 --> 23:55.642
One step forward, three steps back,
and two to the side just because they can.

23:56.143 --> 23:59.020
I don't know if anything's
ever gonna change around here.

23:59.521 --> 24:02.441
<i>I've been told I wish to make</i>

24:26.047 --> 24:30.802

24:30.886 --> 24:34.222
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

<i>Preplanned vacation!</i>

24:38.685 --> 24:40.353
I guess things do change.

24:40.437 --> 24:43.982
-That was your little girl's doing.
-I made that man mad by dancing.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.943
Sometimes it doesn't come
the way you expect it to.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.945
No, I guess it doesn't.

24:50.822 --> 24:53.033
Aw, they turned off our swimming pool?

24:53.116 --> 24:55.202
Man, we don't have nothing.

25:00.165 --> 25:01.917

25:02.000 --> 25:05.587
Careful with the big one.
It's made from California condor skin.

25:06.087 --> 25:08.590
Yes, sir. Thank you for flying Mohican.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.217
I don't think you mean that.

25:11.009 --> 25:11.927
[sighs]

25:12.010 --> 25:15.430
Make it the last night, Charlie.
Make it the last night.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.348
[Rosie] Hey, Frank.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.559
Rosie! What are you doing here?

25:19.643 --> 25:22.896
Turns out taking all those sick days
was bad for my health.

25:23.396 --> 25:25.649
I thought being in charge would be easy.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.486
Now I know why you're
such a miserable prick all the time.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.279
Thanks. I-- That means a lot.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.532
Would you mind if I came back
once in a while?

25:33.615 --> 25:36.743
-Really?
-I hate sucking up to assholes,

25:36.826 --> 25:40.956
but it'd be nice to spend a piece
of my day somewhere I know what I'm doing.

25:41.039 --> 25:43.875
Oh, this is great.
I can go home early now,

25:43.959 --> 25:46.836
watch <i>Colt Luger </i>with my dad,
maybe get another hug.

25:47.837 --> 25:49.047
I love you, Rosie!

25:58.848 --> 25:59.849
Excuse me.

25:59.933 --> 26:03.603
Here we go. Where are you
lovely people going today?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.189
-Oriskany.
-Oriskany, New York!

26:27.711 --> 26:32.173
<i>Oh, 50 cents! Thank you! </i>[laughs]

26:32.257 --> 26:35.218
