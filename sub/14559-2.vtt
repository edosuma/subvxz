WEBVTT

00:03.171 --> 00:07.375
* How are things
on the West Coast? *

00:07.408 --> 00:09.710
* I hear you're movin'
real fine... *

00:09.743 --> 00:12.346
MAN: You might want to take the
lens cap off there, Spielberg.

00:12.380 --> 00:14.248
All right, I'm getting it,
just a sec.

00:14.282 --> 00:16.217
Camera stuff is lame;
let me just show you the house.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.285
N-N-N-N-N-No!
I got it.

00:17.318 --> 00:18.552
Okay, are you ready now?

00:18.586 --> 00:20.354
Yes.
Let's go.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.789
VoilГ .

00:21.822 --> 00:23.157
Oh, my God.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.692
What? What?

00:24.725 --> 00:26.294
You've got
to be kidding me.

00:26.327 --> 00:28.362
The guys back home are
never going to believe this.

00:28.396 --> 00:31.199
Brett, man,
this place is sick.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.233
What, you didn't
think I'd make it?

00:32.266 --> 00:35.403
Nah, man, we all knew
you'd make it, but this...!

00:35.436 --> 00:37.338
Dude, you have no idea

00:37.371 --> 00:40.374
the tail
that comes through here, man.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.809
Do they all come here
for you?

00:41.842 --> 00:44.145
No, jackass,
they come here for Brett,

00:44.178 --> 00:46.147
but to get to Brett,
they gotta go through me,

00:46.180 --> 00:47.115
you know what I mean?

00:48.882 --> 00:50.184
Brett, we got to roll.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.619
We're gonna be late
for the studio.

00:51.652 --> 00:52.620
(groans)

00:52.653 --> 00:54.422
Studio owns me.

00:54.455 --> 00:55.823
House is yours.
Enjoy.

00:55.856 --> 00:56.657
Fair enough.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.359
Let's go check out
my house, shall we?

00:58.392 --> 01:00.361
Okay, here we go.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.463
Check it out, ladies,
here it is--

01:02.496 --> 01:04.298
Brett Chandler's
bedroom.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.666
I'm gonna snag
these sheets

01:05.699 --> 01:07.768
and I'm gonna
sell 'em on eBay.

01:07.801 --> 01:09.270
Let's head
down here.

01:09.303 --> 01:12.373
His wardrobe-- probably
cost more than my life.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.674
Check this.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.309
Look at that view
from the bathroom.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.179
You can check out the waves
while you unload.

01:18.212 --> 01:22.883
Looks like somebody left
the tub on for me here.

01:22.916 --> 01:26.454
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.522
Hey, hey, hey,
somebody!

01:28.556 --> 01:30.524
Hey, somebody!

01:32.460 --> 01:34.195
It was delivered
anonymously

01:34.228 --> 01:35.696
about two hours ago.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.431
Do we know if it's for real?
-He's an actor.

01:37.465 --> 01:39.167
He might have been playing a
joke on his friend.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.401
DAVID: No, I checked.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.902
There haven't been any emergency
phone calls from his house.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.271
Data coding

01:43.304 --> 01:45.239
on the tape says it
was shot six days ago

01:45.273 --> 01:46.440
and, I mean, that's
plenty of time

01:46.474 --> 01:48.242
to cover
something up.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.877
Well, Brett Chandler's
a pretty big star.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.346
We better know what's up before
we go after someone like him.

01:52.380 --> 01:53.781
And what about the girl?

01:53.814 --> 01:54.815
MEGAN:
Charlie's working on it.

01:54.848 --> 01:57.618
He thinks he can pull
a clean image off the tape.

01:57.651 --> 01:59.387
Really? How? Her face
is completely distorted.

01:59.420 --> 02:02.790
CHARLIE: Actually, it's just
being refracted.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.758
It's the same as

02:04.792 --> 02:07.928
when we look at a pencil
through a glass

02:07.961 --> 02:10.564
of water.

02:10.598 --> 02:13.367
It's complicated
by multiple refractions, motion.

02:13.401 --> 02:16.270
Think of a gum ball machine
packed with hundreds

02:16.304 --> 02:17.771
of gum balls.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.540
Imagine striking it
with a sledgehammer.

02:19.573 --> 02:22.743
The resulting chaos
might seem random; it's not.

02:22.776 --> 02:25.513
The path and position
of each and every gum ball

02:25.546 --> 02:28.749
is the result of the
specific forces acting on it--

02:28.782 --> 02:31.385
gravity, velocity,
momentum, mass.

02:31.419 --> 02:32.920
In fact, it's conceivable that,

02:32.953 --> 02:36.324
were we to measure and quantify
each of these forces,

02:36.357 --> 02:38.759
we could use the end position
of the gum balls

02:38.792 --> 02:42.463
to completely reconstruct
the original gum ball machine

02:42.496 --> 02:45.633
with each gum ball placed
exactly where it started.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.801
And it's the same
with this image here.

02:47.835 --> 02:50.871
See? It's being scattered
by the forces of refraction.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.573
But using
Snell's Law,

02:52.606 --> 02:54.642
a dash of Goos-Haenchen
shifts

02:54.675 --> 02:56.510
and a motion-tracking
algorithm...

02:56.544 --> 02:57.778
Ooh, that's freaky.

02:57.811 --> 03:00.214
Yeah, the techs are
already running it

03:00.248 --> 03:01.682
through the facial
recognition software.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.360
Look who's back.

03:25.273 --> 03:27.241
Emptied out
my whole desk.

03:27.275 --> 03:31.545
Wow, you guys don't waste
any time around here, huh?

03:31.579 --> 03:32.480
I mean, they told us

03:32.513 --> 03:34.415
to send everything
down to Quantico, so....

03:34.448 --> 03:36.817
Yeah, I know.
I could've figured.

03:36.850 --> 03:37.751
How are you feeling?

03:37.785 --> 03:39.620
You look a lot better
than the last time

03:39.653 --> 03:41.622
I saw you.
No permanent damage.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.324
At least that I know of.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.393
I guess they just want me
to sit tight here

03:45.426 --> 03:46.894
until I'm reassigned, so...

03:52.466 --> 03:54.968
You going to go
say something?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.805
Not sure what
there is to say.

03:57.838 --> 03:59.607
(computer blipping)
Hey! We got a match.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.378
That's her.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.380
Andrea Barton.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.317
Oop... Looks like we've got
two matches.

04:09.350 --> 04:10.884
DAVID:
That's a Jane Doe.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.786
She's in the morgue.
I guess that answers

04:12.820 --> 04:15.856
the question whether the video
is real or not.

04:15.889 --> 04:18.892
I was wondering why I haven't
seen Andrea in a while.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.428
What a shame.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.830
You have
any information on next of kin?

04:22.863 --> 04:24.332
Someone we might contact?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.399
I'd have to check
her lease.

04:27.335 --> 04:28.436
(sighs)
It's one of these.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.874
(scraping, then thud)

04:33.907 --> 04:35.042
Does Andrea have a roommate?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.510
No. She lived alone.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.717
Is there a back door?
There's a window.

04:53.361 --> 04:54.895
Stand back.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.512
Hey! You!

05:11.545 --> 05:12.513
Get out of the car!

05:12.546 --> 05:13.981
(tires squealing)

05:14.014 --> 05:15.483
(shouting)

05:20.087 --> 05:21.021
David!

05:22.956 --> 05:24.558
(engine roaring
into distance)

05:24.592 --> 05:27.094
That was her
driving the car.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.562
What do you mean? Who?
Our dead girl.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.330
Andrea Barton.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.780
That's the girl you saw
driving the car?

05:46.814 --> 05:47.815
EXAMINER: That'd be
quite a trick.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.149
She's been here
for three days.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.918
Someone had dumped her body
in Runyon Canyon.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.553
DAVID: Well, maybe
she has a sister.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.655
MEGAN: No, I spoke to
the mother back in Tucson.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.123
Andrea's an only child.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.526
Well, I haven't done
the cut yet--

05:58.559 --> 05:59.560
we're pretty
backed up.

05:59.593 --> 06:00.861
But I could give
you some

06:00.894 --> 06:01.995
interesting
preliminaries.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.531
Uh, C.O.D.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.965
looks like drowning,

06:04.998 --> 06:06.634
but it wasn't accidental.

06:06.667 --> 06:07.801
The bruising on her neck

06:07.835 --> 06:09.903
and shoulders suggests
she was held under.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
Struggled.

06:11.939 --> 06:15.175
Her mother said she moved
out here to be an actress.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.844
I'd say she wanted it
pretty badly.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.946
Why do you say that?

06:18.979 --> 06:19.913
She's had work done.

06:19.947 --> 06:21.449
Breast augmentation,

06:21.482 --> 06:22.950
chin work, for sure,

06:22.983 --> 06:24.618
a little bit
of liposuction.

06:24.652 --> 06:26.954
Lipo?
She's barely 100 pounds.

06:26.987 --> 06:29.122
Yeah, I think
it's about time

06:29.156 --> 06:31.759
somebody paid
our movie star a visit.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.561
Thanks for letting me
team up with you

06:33.594 --> 06:35.529
on this one, Liz.
Yeah.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.965
Seems like David
wants nothing

06:37.998 --> 06:39.032
to do with me
right now.

06:39.066 --> 06:40.834
Aw, what do
you expect?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.570
Come on, you're a
good guy, Colby,

06:42.603 --> 06:44.037
but you've lied to
him for two years.

06:44.071 --> 06:46.039
Well, I lied to you, too.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.041
Ah, but only
for six months.

06:48.075 --> 06:50.110
I'm less invested.

06:50.143 --> 06:52.946
Besides, teaming us wasn't
my idea, it was Don's.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.115
Really. So you can
keep an eye on me?

06:55.148 --> 06:56.984
Look, out in the field,

06:57.017 --> 06:58.986
I'm just like any other agent,
okay? Right.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.988
Except you're sleeping
with the boss.

07:01.021 --> 07:03.491
Granger, I didn't
partner with you

07:03.524 --> 07:05.959
so I could report on you,
you got it?

07:05.993 --> 07:08.061
Sure.

07:09.997 --> 07:12.666
Hey guys,
we're looking for Brett.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.134
Agents Granger
and Warner.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.503
You're agents?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.871
What agency you with?
ICM, CAA?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.172
FBI.

07:19.206 --> 07:20.941
Oh, cool.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.010
Uh, I-I don't know if you're
signing new clients, but, uh,

07:23.043 --> 07:24.077
I-I got a showcase
tomorrow night.

07:24.111 --> 07:25.779
Yeah, where's Brett?
Is he in here?

07:25.813 --> 07:26.880
Yeah, yeah, he's here.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.215
He's out back.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.883
Wh-What about
my showcase?

07:29.917 --> 07:31.985
Ah. Wouldn't miss it.

07:34.021 --> 07:37.090
(medium-tempo pop music blaring
from distance)

07:37.124 --> 07:39.960
(overlapping, indistinct
conversations)

07:49.770 --> 07:51.805
Brett Chandler.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.973
FBI.

07:55.843 --> 07:59.513
Feds? Really?

07:59.547 --> 08:02.015
I'm playing a DEA agent
in my next film.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.784
Maybe I could, uh,
pick your brains.

08:03.817 --> 08:04.852
Why are you here?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.119
Who are you?

08:06.153 --> 08:07.287
Logan Oliver.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.656
I handle Brett's security.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.123
Uh, Logan keeps me
out of trouble.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.693
And this is, uh,
Josh Ryan.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.794
He usually gets me into it.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.028
Hey, you know,

08:15.062 --> 08:17.164
if you ever wanna come up
here and hang out...

08:17.197 --> 08:18.932
you'd definitely make the cut.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.134
You all three live here?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.670
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.707
Take a look at this.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.676
Is that...?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.210
That's my bathroom.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.745
What the hell is this?

08:31.779 --> 08:33.714
Well, that's what we were hoping
you could tell us.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.683
It's gotta be a fake
or something.

08:35.716 --> 08:36.817
She's down at the morgue.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.986
Seems pretty real to me.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.054
This is what she looked like
when she was alive.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.756
You guys know her?

08:42.790 --> 08:44.224
Never seen her.

08:44.257 --> 08:46.093
No.

08:46.126 --> 08:47.060
Swear to God.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.698
Lot of people come and
go here, you know?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.099
Got an open door
policy.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.768
Is that smart,
given how famous you are?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.570
That's how Brian
would have done it.

08:56.604 --> 08:57.638
Who's Brian?

08:57.671 --> 08:59.339
My brother.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.609
We all moved out here together
from Baltimore.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.977
Flat broke, dreams
of being big stars.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.846
He was killed
in a carjacking

09:05.879 --> 09:07.314
six months
after we got here.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.049
So this is somehow
for him?

09:09.082 --> 09:10.283
Everything's for him.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.952
And this would
have been his way,

09:11.985 --> 09:12.986
you know,
share the wealth.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.822
What about Pete?
Where's he?

09:14.855 --> 09:16.056
That's his name, right?

09:16.089 --> 09:17.891
The friend of yours
who shot this video?

09:17.925 --> 09:19.059
Pete took that?

09:19.092 --> 09:21.061
Pete is a buddy
we grew up with.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.196
He was out visiting
a week or so ago.

09:23.230 --> 09:24.998
Okay, so where
is he now?

09:25.032 --> 09:26.734
He split kind of sudden.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.069
I guess now we know why.

09:29.102 --> 09:31.104
Look, I feel awful
about this.

09:31.138 --> 09:33.841
I mean, my house,
this girl...

09:33.874 --> 09:36.109
Whatever you guys need,
open door policy

09:36.143 --> 09:37.645
applies to you, too.

09:37.678 --> 09:39.813
You don't mind

09:39.847 --> 09:41.782
if I watch a little bit,
see how it's done?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.050
Pick our brains.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.186
It'd be awesome
research.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.128
Oh! Hi.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.664
Hi.

09:56.697 --> 09:57.931
Charlie gave me a key,

09:57.965 --> 09:59.933
so that I'm not always
making you get up

09:59.967 --> 10:01.068
to answer the door for me.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.136
I don't mind getting up.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.138
Hey...
ALAN: Hi, Charlie.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.239
Hi.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.340
What are you doing?

10:07.374 --> 10:08.876
I'm cleaning
the fish tank.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.043
Mmm.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.712
He's also already trimmed
the rose bushes,

10:11.745 --> 10:13.981
straightened the attic
and cleaned out the garage.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.115
If this keeps up,

10:15.148 --> 10:17.184
we're liable to have a new roof
on the house by morning.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.019
Okay, so,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.021
I will ask again--
what are you doing?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.122
(sighs)

10:22.155 --> 10:23.256
You know that old friendship

10:23.290 --> 10:26.126
math paper that I wrote
when I was, uh, when I was 12?

10:26.159 --> 10:27.427
Sure.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.664
"A Mathematical Analysis
of Friendship Dynamics."

10:30.698 --> 10:31.932
I sent it off to
a couple journals,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.033
to see if there was
any interest

10:33.066 --> 10:33.867
in publishing.

10:33.901 --> 10:36.269
There was--
great interest, in fact.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.906
Well, that's great!
Why aren't you working on it?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.308
In a word-- procrastination.

10:41.341 --> 10:42.843
Why? What's wrong?

10:42.876 --> 10:45.345
You know, I sat down
to update it and expand it.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.981
I just... I'd like it to be
a little more relevant...

10:48.015 --> 10:51.218
but, um, it's just kind of
not coming to me.

10:51.251 --> 10:54.054
Well, I mean,
I've read the article, Charlie.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.088
I think it's great.

10:55.122 --> 10:56.023
You just need to sit down

10:56.056 --> 10:58.258
and actually force yourself to
work on it.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.392
You know what?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.731
I think I can tell Don
the exact size

11:03.764 --> 11:05.132
of the killer he's looking for.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.099
How are you gonna do that?

11:06.133 --> 11:07.968
Displacement.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.102
Check it out.

11:09.136 --> 11:10.470
Look what happens
to this water level

11:10.503 --> 11:12.172
when I remove
this rock.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.440
Yeah, well,
of course, Charlie,

11:13.473 --> 11:15.108
the level drops.
By an amount

11:15.142 --> 11:17.745
exactly equal
to the volume of the rock.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.446
See, Don thinks

11:19.479 --> 11:22.182
the killer was in the tub
with the girl

11:22.215 --> 11:23.817
when she was killed.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.252
So when the killer

11:25.285 --> 11:27.387
climbed out,
the water level fell

11:27.420 --> 11:31.324
by a very specific amount.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.293
I don't see any
new clues on the video.

11:33.326 --> 11:34.294
How about the kid

11:34.327 --> 11:35.863
who shot it?
I got nothing.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.431
Colby contacted
his parents in Maryland.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.101
I got a list of other friends
he might be staying with.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.803
You put Colby
on the case?

11:42.836 --> 11:45.105
Yeah. You know, I mean,
until he's reassigned.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.039
I-I needed
another agent.

11:46.073 --> 11:47.975
He must be looking at a
pretty prime post.

11:48.008 --> 11:51.244
I mean, after what he did,
he's considered a hero.

11:53.180 --> 11:54.147
Have a look at this.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.950
These are photos
of the victim, Andrea Barton.

11:56.984 --> 11:59.252
We gathered them
from her apartment.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.221
Wow, I wouldn't have
even recognized her.

12:01.254 --> 12:04.257
DON: Yeah, yeah, she completely
transformed herself.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.358
The question is why?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.994
Well, she's
at an impressionable age.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.996
Broken home, maybe,

12:09.029 --> 12:10.297
dysfunctional family.

12:10.330 --> 12:12.065
Surgeries could've stemmed
from a desire to change

12:12.099 --> 12:14.802
who she really is.
DAVID: Yeah, maybe.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.804
Maybe she's trying to hide
from something in the past.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.005
What about the surgeon?

12:18.038 --> 12:21.141
Yeah, the guy's name
is, uh, Dr. Jacobsen.

12:21.174 --> 12:23.343
I found his card
in her desk.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.478
Check him out.
Yeah.

12:31.384 --> 12:35.055
Wow, th-this is... wow.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.990
Yeah, "wow."

12:37.024 --> 12:39.159
Measured against
my recent accommodations,

12:39.192 --> 12:41.361
a space station,
a Zen hermitage...

12:41.394 --> 12:44.031
no, this just--
it's a little excessive.

12:44.064 --> 12:45.966
This is excessive
by any means, Larry,

12:45.999 --> 12:47.901
but it's also quite awesome.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.170
No, it's emptiness itself.

12:50.203 --> 12:52.139
This tempts me not.

12:54.541 --> 12:58.245
Oh, I may have to take back
a portion of what I just said.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.847
Oh, what, the tub?

12:59.880 --> 13:01.982
Nothing like this
at the monastery

13:02.015 --> 13:04.384
and you know how
I love a good soak.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.019
That's right about
where she died.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.220
All right,
that's unpleasant.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.288
Come on out of there.

13:08.321 --> 13:11.558
Hey, you guys
with the FBI?

13:11.591 --> 13:14.094
Yeah, hi, we're your...
I'm Charles Eppes,

13:14.127 --> 13:16.229
and this is Lawrence Fleinhardt.
Hi.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.166
You guys don't
look like FBI agents.

13:19.199 --> 13:21.068
I'm actually
a math professor.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.335
Dr. Fleinhardt
is a physicist.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.937
Currently on sabbatical.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.272
Well...
It's not important.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.141
So you're not with the FBI?

13:28.175 --> 13:29.509
Yeah, yeah.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.979
Yeah, we are consultants for the
FBI. -In a sense, today.

13:32.012 --> 13:33.847
What, solving crimes with math?

13:35.248 --> 13:37.117
No offense, but how is that
suppose to work?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.852
No offense taken.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.587
In this case,

13:40.620 --> 13:43.256
we're trying
to determine the basic

13:43.290 --> 13:46.126
parameters of the killer's
body size, using

13:46.159 --> 13:48.962
a method called
"submerged volume."

13:48.996 --> 13:50.263
See, look,

13:50.297 --> 13:52.265
in this picture, we can see that

13:52.299 --> 13:54.601
the final water level in the tub

13:54.634 --> 13:59.239
is, um, is just right about...
right about here.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.974
Yeah, you see,
it's establishing

14:01.008 --> 14:03.043
a high water level, that's where
things really get complicated.

14:03.076 --> 14:05.145
Now, we do know
from the video

14:05.178 --> 14:07.147
that the towel was hanging
in just such a way

14:07.180 --> 14:10.183
that its lowest edge was just
below the rim of the tub.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.920
And the towel's edge is wet.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.154
So we have to calculate

14:14.187 --> 14:16.056
for the towel's absorbency,
evaporation,

14:16.089 --> 14:18.391
the bubbles-- but we do
know that, at some point,

14:18.425 --> 14:23.063
the minimum level of the water
was just about here.

14:23.096 --> 14:24.364
See, it's high

14:24.397 --> 14:26.066
because someone else
was in this water.

14:26.099 --> 14:27.067
The killer.

14:27.100 --> 14:29.169
Yeah, so if we measure
the volume of the water

14:29.202 --> 14:30.637
between these two lines,
we can calculate

14:30.670 --> 14:32.005
the killer's body size.

14:32.039 --> 14:34.908
Sounds like something
out of a movie.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.476
Only not as cool.

14:40.213 --> 14:43.216
You're asking me the whys
of cosmetic surgery?

14:43.250 --> 14:45.485
Women have a million reasons.

14:45.518 --> 14:47.654
And honestly,

14:47.687 --> 14:49.389
it isn't the whys
that bought my Bentley.

14:49.422 --> 14:51.024
Yeah, well,
we don't want to know

14:51.058 --> 14:53.260
about all
your patients, Doctor, okay?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.161
Just this one right here.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.963
Who is it?

14:55.996 --> 14:58.231
She's your patient
and you don't know who she is?

14:58.265 --> 14:59.599
No, I mean
which one of the twins?

14:59.632 --> 15:01.334
Andrea or Tracy?

15:01.368 --> 15:04.037
Andrea Barton was an only child.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.907
Well, so was Tracy Meade,
but I cut them to be identical.

15:18.351 --> 15:20.220
DON:
They look exactly the same, huh?

15:20.253 --> 15:21.989
Yeah, they were already
similar to begin with,

15:22.022 --> 15:23.556
then after the surgeries...

15:23.590 --> 15:25.325
It turns out,
actually, our victim

15:25.358 --> 15:27.560
is this girl right here,
Tracy Meade.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.062
Well, how'd that happen?

15:29.096 --> 15:31.231
Neither of them have
fingerprints in the system.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.499
And Andrea was
the only one

15:32.532 --> 15:34.401
to get a new license
since the surgeries.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.136
So when we ran facial
recognition,

15:36.169 --> 15:36.869
hers was the photo to pop.

15:36.903 --> 15:40.640
Oh.
Oh, billing records indicate

15:40.673 --> 15:43.076
neither of the girls
paid for their work.

15:43.110 --> 15:45.545
The costs were covered
by a third party,

15:45.578 --> 15:47.547
Ms. Leslie Dennis.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.482
Leslie Dennis,
the Melrose Madam?

15:49.516 --> 15:51.551
Oh, come on, you guys
don't ever browse

15:51.584 --> 15:53.386
the trashy gossip
Web sites?

15:53.420 --> 15:54.454
She was investigated

15:54.487 --> 15:57.024
for tax evasion tied to running
an escort service.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.758
So why'd she pay
to have them look alike?

15:58.791 --> 16:01.661
I mean, judging
from how many guys have

16:01.694 --> 16:02.695
fantasies about being
with twins...

16:02.729 --> 16:04.597
I mean, you know,
in that way, it makes sense.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.200
Mm-hmm.
All right, well, talk to 'em.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.469
See if you can connect either
of them to Brett Chandler.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.271
All right.

16:12.405 --> 16:14.407
Thanks. Hey, David.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.277
Hey, man, you, uh...

16:17.310 --> 16:20.580
haven't really given me a chance
yet to, uh, say thanks.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.115
For what?

16:22.149 --> 16:24.484
You saved my life, man.

16:24.517 --> 16:26.519
It goes with the job.
David, come on.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.621
I don't want there to be all
this weirdness, you know?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.290
What do you mean?

16:30.323 --> 16:32.592
Two years not knowing
who your best friend really is?

16:32.625 --> 16:34.627
What's weird about that?
You don't think

16:34.661 --> 16:37.030
I didn't want to tell you
that I was working undercover?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.166
I couldn't tell
you, David.

16:39.199 --> 16:40.633
You get that, right?

16:40.667 --> 16:42.302
Yeah, man, I get it.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.503
And I respect it.

16:43.536 --> 16:45.272
I've got get to work.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.777
Have we allowed for evaporation?

16:50.810 --> 16:53.113
Evaporation, check.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.614
Hi, Larry.
Hey.

16:54.647 --> 16:56.416
Hello, Charlie.
Hey.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.584
I just came to see
how your work...

16:57.617 --> 16:59.119
Don't. Don't say it.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.454
Okay.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.423
If you don't want me to.
I don't.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.158
My, my, what have we here?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.694
My "Friendship
Dynamics" work

17:07.727 --> 17:09.062
is going to be published.

17:09.096 --> 17:10.497
If he ever writes it.

17:12.232 --> 17:13.366
Well, I mean,
speaking frankly here, Charles,

17:13.400 --> 17:16.603
I did find some of the math
just a trifle subjective,

17:16.636 --> 17:18.471
your random Apollonian Networks
in particular.

17:18.505 --> 17:21.474
Well, actually, Larry, it goes
deeper than Apollonian Networks.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.344
The numbers aren't transcending.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.414
You know, they're not finding
the humanity.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.250
But you can't always find
transcendency

17:30.283 --> 17:32.152
in human connections.

17:32.185 --> 17:35.155
It's similar to the bonds
between atoms.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.324
I mean, some are
eternal and able

17:37.357 --> 17:40.093
to change the nature
of those atoms they join.

17:40.127 --> 17:42.529
Others are fleeting,
insubstantial,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.731
potentially combustible.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.566
Even catastrophic.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.800
Food for thought.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.669
Yeah... bon appГ©tit.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.743
(whispering)

18:00.213 --> 18:02.149
This is private property, you
have no right to be back here.

18:02.182 --> 18:04.717
Yeah, we rung the bell,
nobody answered,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.187
and, uh, the sign said
"come around back."

18:07.220 --> 18:09.122
I left that for FedEx,

18:09.156 --> 18:11.424
not for the federal government.
Oh, Ms. Dennis,

18:11.458 --> 18:14.627
we're here to see about
one of your girls-- Tracy Meade.

18:14.661 --> 18:16.729
You know where she is?

18:16.763 --> 18:17.897
She hasn't been around for days.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.366
She's in the county morgue.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.470
Oh, my God, I've been
worried sick about her,

18:23.503 --> 18:24.504
but I didn't think...

18:24.537 --> 18:25.738
What about Andrea Barton?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.374
WOMAN:
What about her?

18:28.908 --> 18:30.577
I got away from you
once already.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.612
Thought I should make it
easier for you this time.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.348
DAVID:
That's cute.

18:35.382 --> 18:36.916
Why'd you run before?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.852
I didn't know who you were.

18:39.886 --> 18:43.390
Look, a lot of guys have
twisted fantasies about twins.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.757
What if some freak
has a fantasy about

18:44.791 --> 18:47.727
killing a pair?
So you knew Tracy was dead?

18:47.760 --> 18:49.762
I didn't know.
Tracy never went anywhere

18:49.796 --> 18:51.298
without telling me--
when she disappeared,

18:51.331 --> 18:52.599
I knew something was wrong.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.168
You or Tracy ever find yourself

18:55.202 --> 18:57.404
over at Brett Chandler's
mansion?

18:57.437 --> 18:58.905
Yeah, we were regulars there.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.774
But Tracy started going even
when we weren't requested.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.810
I think she was starstruck.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.845
MEGAN: Really? 'Cause we showed
your photograph

19:05.878 --> 19:07.180
to Brett and all
his friends

19:07.214 --> 19:08.815
and none of them
knew who you were.

19:08.848 --> 19:10.783
Then Brett and his friends lied.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.920
(elevator bell dings)

19:13.953 --> 19:15.555
Go ahead, gentlemen.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.856
Welcome to the FBI.

19:16.889 --> 19:20.927
(excited chattering,
whooping, laughing)

19:23.896 --> 19:25.832
Would you like to hang?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.872
Oh, it looks like
the circus is here.

19:32.905 --> 19:33.873
This is great!

19:33.906 --> 19:35.742
Don...
Hey.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.776
this is Brett,

19:36.809 --> 19:37.844
Josh, Logan,

19:37.877 --> 19:40.580
Brett's manager, Mark.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.981
Guys, this is
Agent Don Eppes, my boss.

19:42.014 --> 19:42.982
What do you say, guys?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.884
Appreciate you showing us
around the office.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.420
It's gonna be a huge help on my
next role. -Are you kidding?

19:47.454 --> 19:49.689
It's our pleasure-- we're all
big fans around here.

19:49.722 --> 19:50.723
So what do you think, Colby?

19:50.757 --> 19:51.824
Where should we start all this?

19:51.858 --> 19:53.793
I was thinking
maybe Interrogation.

19:53.826 --> 19:56.396
(laughing, hooting)

19:56.429 --> 19:57.597
Follow me, guys.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.001
Oh, man! This is what
I'm talking about.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.671
Ah, it's so real!

20:04.704 --> 20:06.673
We love it!
Ah, man!

20:06.706 --> 20:09.342
This is where you sweat out
the confessions, huh?

20:09.376 --> 20:10.743
Yeah, something like that.

20:10.777 --> 20:11.978
So, listen here.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.414
We know you
guys lied to us.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.682
Wait, hold on a minute.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.849
What are you talking about?

20:16.883 --> 20:17.884
The three of you
guys all said

20:17.917 --> 20:19.619
that you didn't know this girl.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.254
We happen to know
that that's not true.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.394
Okay, busted.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.629
What, like we're going
to admit to the FBI

20:29.662 --> 20:31.931
we had a bunch of hookers
up at the place?

20:31.964 --> 20:33.733
We got a little bit
freaked out; we're sorry.

20:33.766 --> 20:35.635
Oh, yeah? So that's it, huh?

20:35.668 --> 20:36.769
Hey, Don.
Hey, Charlie.

20:36.803 --> 20:39.005
You guys met?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.940
Yeah, math detective.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.542
How're the calculations
going, professor?

20:42.575 --> 20:43.510
Did you find the killer yet?

20:43.543 --> 20:47.847
Well, as a matter of fact...
(clears throat)

20:47.880 --> 20:49.816
...my measurements yielded

20:49.849 --> 20:52.051
a net water displacement
of 89.6 liters.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.786
Now, that translates to a killer

20:53.820 --> 20:55.855
who's well
above average in size.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.859
COLBY:
What're you, Logan,

20:59.892 --> 21:02.429
like, six-four?
210, 215?

21:02.462 --> 21:03.696
That fits perfectly

21:03.730 --> 21:05.798
within the boundaries
of my results.

21:05.832 --> 21:06.966
Why don't you take
these guys out and let me

21:06.999 --> 21:08.401
have a little chat
with Logan then?

21:08.435 --> 21:09.669
Is this some kind of a joke?

21:09.702 --> 21:11.571
No, we're not going anywhere.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.672
Yeah, you are.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.040
Let's go, guys.
The three of you.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.961
Okay, I was
in that tub with her,

21:34.994 --> 21:36.596
but I didn't have anything
to do with her death.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.964
What happened?
What, she turned you down?

21:37.997 --> 21:40.433
She was hot for Brett
and you got angry and...?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.869
Tracy wasn't
into Brett, all right?

21:42.902 --> 21:45.438
She was into me.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.840
We had a thing;
it was serious, too,

21:47.874 --> 21:51.077
you know, for real and...

21:51.110 --> 21:53.513
She was alive
when I got out of that tub.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.816
So who killed her?

21:56.849 --> 21:58.485
Look, I don't know.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.587
Just... not for sure.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.622
Not for sure?

22:02.655 --> 22:04.056
Don't say another
word, Logan.

22:04.090 --> 22:05.692
Wait, what do you think
you're doing?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.960
I just talked to our attorney.
This interview's over.

22:07.994 --> 22:10.363
Hey, listen... -So this is how
the FBI works these days?

22:10.397 --> 22:13.433
You dupe these guys into coming
down here, then you ambush them?

22:13.466 --> 22:14.934
Nothing Logan said in
there is admissible.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.604
I don't that's really for you
to decide, now, is it?

22:17.637 --> 22:19.572
My client has a movie
opening in three weeks.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.074
If you ruin his reputation by
dragging him into some sloppy

22:22.108 --> 22:23.843
murder investigation,

22:23.876 --> 22:25.712
you could cost a lot
of people a lot of money.

22:25.745 --> 22:26.779
Let me tell you something,
I don't care about that, okay?

22:26.813 --> 22:28.681
I don't care one iota about
that-- what I care about

22:28.715 --> 22:30.617
is the dead girl
in your client's house.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.051
Now, if any of them
had anything to do with it,

22:32.084 --> 22:33.653
I'm gonna be coming
after 'em, okay?

22:33.686 --> 22:35.955
Then do it when you have
an arrest warrant, Agent Eppes.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.924
Until then,
stay the hell away from them.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.062
I mean, he definitely knew more,

22:43.095 --> 22:45.031
and he would've said,
too, you know?

22:45.064 --> 22:46.599
LIZ: Yeah, well, at least we
know

22:46.633 --> 22:47.967
we're looking in
the right direction now.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.569
I love that manager guy saying

22:49.602 --> 22:51.404
we're dragging the kid
into a sloppy investigation.

22:51.438 --> 22:53.406
Forget about the manager.

22:53.440 --> 22:54.707
Brett Chandler's his cash cow,

22:54.741 --> 22:55.975
and he'll do
anything he can

22:56.008 --> 22:58.044
to keep the money
from being turned off.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.045
So, how was Colby?

22:59.078 --> 23:01.047
He did fine.
Yeah?

23:01.080 --> 23:02.449
Focused?

23:02.482 --> 23:04.551
Yeah, I said he did fine.

23:04.584 --> 23:07.487
What? If you want more,
talk to him yourself.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.021
What?
Don,

23:09.055 --> 23:11.458
it's hard enough as it is
getting respect out there

23:11.491 --> 23:13.192
when they all know
we're sleeping together.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.496
(groans) You want to play right
into their assumptions?

23:16.529 --> 23:17.764
Thanks. I appreciate the help.

23:17.797 --> 23:20.066
(phone ringing)

23:20.099 --> 23:24.003
(shower running)

23:24.036 --> 23:25.805
Agent Warner.

23:25.838 --> 23:26.906
It's Logan Oliver.

23:26.939 --> 23:29.842
Look, I need to talk to you,
but if I say anything,

23:29.876 --> 23:31.110
everything will come apart.

23:31.143 --> 23:32.044
Okay, Logan, calm down.

23:32.078 --> 23:34.814
What do you mean?
What will come apart?

23:34.847 --> 23:37.083
Okay, listen to me,
I'm coming to the house

23:37.116 --> 23:38.751
right now to get you, okay?

23:38.785 --> 23:40.987
Look, I'm not home--
I-I'm in my car,

23:41.020 --> 23:43.089
at the turnout at Brenner Park.

23:43.122 --> 23:45.057
It's all just gone too far.

23:45.091 --> 23:47.193
You know? -Okay, well, just stay
where you are.

23:47.226 --> 23:49.161
I'll be there in a few minutes.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.804
You sure this is where
he said he'd be?

23:57.837 --> 24:00.006
Yes.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.508
He must have had
second thoughts.

24:01.541 --> 24:03.876
You know, maybe he went home.
-Whoa-ho, here we go.

24:03.910 --> 24:04.944
Hey.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.619
Is he conscious?
No.

24:14.687 --> 24:16.122
He's dead.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.667
COLBY: Single shot, like you
saw, pretty much straight-on,

24:27.700 --> 24:29.636
through-and-through
the left hand.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.938
LIZ: Okay, so he saw the gun,
and probably

24:31.971 --> 24:32.739
raised his hands up
as a shield.

24:32.772 --> 24:35.842
Yeah, a lot of
good it did, huh?

24:35.875 --> 24:37.610
So, just out of
curiosity, partner,

24:37.644 --> 24:40.212
how come you didn't call me
when Logan called you?

24:40.246 --> 24:43.883
'Cause I was with Don.

24:43.916 --> 24:46.986
Hey, let's find out where
Brett and Josh were tonight.

24:47.019 --> 24:48.120
Yeah, I think
that's going to be tough.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.088
After today, there's no way

24:49.121 --> 24:50.857
their handlers are going
to let us near them.

24:50.890 --> 24:52.058
Wait a second.

24:52.091 --> 24:53.660
Logan lived
in Brett's house, right?

24:53.693 --> 24:55.294
I mean, that was
his legal address.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.963
Now he's the victim
of a homicide.

24:56.996 --> 24:58.931
So, we get a warrant
to search his possessions.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.900
That'll get you in the house,
right? Good thinking.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.576
No way, Agents.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.544
Get the hell out of here.
-We got a warrant.

25:11.578 --> 25:13.613
Well, you have no
decency at all, do you?

25:13.646 --> 25:16.783
You got to do this now, with all
we're going through?

25:16.816 --> 25:19.018
All right, this limits you
to Logan's personal areas.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.853
In this house,
I'd say that means

25:20.887 --> 25:22.221
nowhere outside
the guest quarters.

25:22.254 --> 25:24.190
This way.

25:38.070 --> 25:41.007
This is so damn
messed up.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.309
I'm sorry for
your loss, Brett.

25:43.342 --> 25:46.946
Four years ago,
my brother's killed, now this?

25:46.979 --> 25:49.081
What the hell is going on?

25:49.115 --> 25:51.283
Hey, where were you
last night, Brett?

25:51.317 --> 25:53.285
I know you
have to ask.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.588
I was here.

25:55.622 --> 25:56.756
Me and Josh.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.290
Was there
someone around

25:58.324 --> 26:00.292
who can corroborate that?

26:00.326 --> 26:01.761
I don't think so.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.129
It was pretty quiet.

26:03.162 --> 26:07.667
Course now, it's a circus again
down there.

26:07.700 --> 26:08.935
I shouldn't
even be up here.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.670
Mark would freak
out if he knew

26:10.703 --> 26:13.039
I was talking
to you guys.

26:13.072 --> 26:14.941
I should get
back down.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.381
Was any of that real?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.816
Real good acting.

26:23.850 --> 26:26.619
Liz, why don't you come
take a look at this.

26:26.653 --> 26:28.721
What?
Do I really want to see?

26:28.755 --> 26:30.790
Logan had these
huge data files

26:30.823 --> 26:32.058
that it looks like

26:32.091 --> 26:34.193
he was e-mailing
to a love-2-love

26:34.226 --> 26:35.394
at Melrose-Madam-dot-com.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.929
Yeah, Love-2-love's

26:36.963 --> 26:38.130
got to be Tracy.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.699
Not too big a leap.

26:39.732 --> 26:42.802
I just want to know
what it was he was sending her.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.372
Hey.
LIZ: Hey.

26:46.405 --> 26:49.108
I really appreciate you
taking a look at this.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.677
Hope we're not ruining
breakfast. Hey.

26:50.710 --> 26:51.844
Not a problem.
Hey, man.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.680
It's really good
to see you, man.

26:53.713 --> 26:54.947
Yeah, thanks.
Hey.

26:54.981 --> 26:57.216
Charlie was really worried
about you for a while.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.651
We all were.

26:58.685 --> 26:59.752
Yeah, but you're
back here,

26:59.786 --> 27:01.120
and you're
a hero, man,

27:01.153 --> 27:02.388
and it's all good.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.091
Oh, come on, I don't know
about this hero stuff.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.893
Hey, hey, there you
are-- that Colby.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.161
Hi. It's so good to
see you, I mean it.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.329
Thank you.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.331
I can't tell you
how happy I was

27:12.364 --> 27:13.866
to find out that you're
still one of the,

27:13.900 --> 27:15.034
you know,
the good guys.

27:15.067 --> 27:16.435
Welcome back.

27:16.468 --> 27:20.339
Let's see...
here are the data files.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.676
They're MPEG-1 media files
transcoded from MPEG-2.

27:23.710 --> 27:24.844
What's that mean?

27:24.877 --> 27:26.012
CHARLIE:
They're audio-visual files.

27:26.045 --> 27:26.979
It's how
they code DVDs.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.247
So, he was e-mailing
his girlfriend a movie?

27:28.280 --> 27:31.784
ALAN: There was a time when you
took a girl out to a movie.

27:31.818 --> 27:34.754
Or you rented a VHS
and stayed home and watched it,

27:34.787 --> 27:36.088
but now you e-mail movies?

27:36.122 --> 27:37.757
Where's the romance in this?

27:37.790 --> 27:39.759
This movie's called
Breaker's Edge.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.828
I've seen ads for this,
but it's not out yet.

27:41.861 --> 27:42.995
ALAN:
Well, if it's not,

27:43.029 --> 27:44.196
how did this guy get it?

27:44.230 --> 27:45.364
COLBY:
Well, pirated DVDs

27:45.397 --> 27:46.465
are a big industry.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.735
I mean, the FBI has
a whole section devoted to that.

27:48.768 --> 27:51.704
Well, let's see
if it's got a watermark.

27:51.738 --> 27:54.373
Studios sometimes put
a digital tag in the coding.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.908
The idea being
that if a pirated

27:55.942 --> 27:57.777
DVD shows up,
it can be traced

27:57.810 --> 28:00.046
back to a source.

28:02.849 --> 28:04.784
It was issued to Brett Chandler.

28:09.321 --> 28:11.123
What makes you think

28:11.157 --> 28:12.792
I know anything
about DVD pirating?

28:12.825 --> 28:14.894
I'll bet nothing goes on
in this place

28:14.927 --> 28:16.796
that you don't get
a percentage of.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.766
Brett Chandler got pre-releases
of all the big movies.

28:19.799 --> 28:21.433
That's a perk of being a star.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.035
And Logan was
e-mailing them to Tracy.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.805
What we want to know is
what Tracy was doing with them.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.807
I run a legal dating service.

28:27.840 --> 28:31.177
What the girls do with their
own time is their business.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.746
Ms. Dennis, how deep
do you want us to dig here?

28:33.780 --> 28:36.248
Right now, your dating service
is not our concern, but

28:36.282 --> 28:37.950
we could make it our concern.

28:37.984 --> 28:40.920
MEGAN: Or we could get a warrant
for your Web server.

28:40.953 --> 28:43.022
I'm sure there's a lot
of exciting stuff

28:43.055 --> 28:44.957
at Melrose-Madam-dot-com.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.926
All we want
is a name.

28:48.294 --> 28:51.130
It's two names--
Kevin and Bryce Lee.

28:51.163 --> 28:54.466
They run a club in Hollywood
called Bedouin.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.335
Just don't let them
know it came from me.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.004
Oh, we'll be real discreet.

28:58.037 --> 28:59.972
MEGAN:
Oh, yeah.

29:04.143 --> 29:07.246
It's hard to believe people
line up to get into this place.

29:07.279 --> 29:09.816
Lots more get lined up
to be turned away.

29:09.849 --> 29:12.084
Don't ever say I don't take you
to the hottest places.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.559
Excuse me.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.361
FBI.

29:22.394 --> 29:25.031
We're looking for
Kevin or Bryce Lee.

29:28.400 --> 29:31.437
Hey, I noticed you still
haven't cleared things up

29:31.470 --> 29:32.972
with Colby yet.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.374
How long you going to
leave him on the hook?

29:35.407 --> 29:36.542
(sighs)

29:36.575 --> 29:38.144
The hours we logged
on stakeouts,

29:38.177 --> 29:40.012
the stuff I told that guy--

29:40.046 --> 29:41.313
I trusted him.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.149
Yeah, but we were
all fooled, David.

29:43.182 --> 29:46.185
He was looking
for a mole in the FBI.

29:46.218 --> 29:49.088
I mean, he was really
investigating all of us.

29:49.121 --> 29:50.923
It hasn't bothered you at all?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.324
Honestly.

29:57.329 --> 29:58.998
A little bit weird, right?

29:59.031 --> 30:01.868
Liquor guy's
taking alcohol out

30:01.901 --> 30:03.502
instead of bringing it in.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.536
Hmm.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.475
MAN: Mario says you want to talk
to me?

30:09.508 --> 30:11.210
Hey. Maybe you're the one

30:11.243 --> 30:13.012
who should be talking to us.

30:13.045 --> 30:14.914
Want to put your
hands behind your back?

30:17.149 --> 30:18.517
Gun, David!

30:18.550 --> 30:19.852
(gunshots)

30:23.990 --> 30:25.858
(gunshots)

30:28.527 --> 30:30.529
Think about it...

30:30.562 --> 30:32.999
unless you want to wind up
like your brother out here.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.566
Okay. All right.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.172
Let's go.

30:40.206 --> 30:41.908
Come on!

30:44.276 --> 30:46.278
DAVID: We just talked to the
hospital.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.114
What did they say?
How's my brother?

30:48.147 --> 30:49.481
Now, I think we're going

30:49.515 --> 30:51.583
to ask you
a few questions first.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.085
And maybe afterward,
we'll get around

30:53.119 --> 30:54.353
to talking about your brother.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.923
You know
either of them?

30:56.956 --> 30:59.091
You were doing business
with both of them,

30:59.125 --> 31:00.492
and now they're dead.

31:00.526 --> 31:03.562
Whoa, whoa, no,
I don't know nothing about that.

31:03.595 --> 31:04.964
Of course you don't.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.966
Never even seen that guy before.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.034
Yeah? What about her?

31:11.437 --> 31:13.973
DAVID:
Come on, you want to know

31:14.006 --> 31:15.541
about your brother or not?

31:15.574 --> 31:18.077
How'd the deal work?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.179
Leslie's girls--
they're always ending up

31:20.212 --> 31:22.915
in the homes of movie stars,
producers, directors, right?

31:22.949 --> 31:23.983
So we had a standing
arrangement.

31:24.016 --> 31:26.052
Any girl who could snag me
an unreleased movie--

31:26.085 --> 31:28.120
there would be five grand
waiting for her.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.222
How many movies
did she get for you?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.457
Uh, ten,

31:31.490 --> 31:33.993
maybe 12 in the last six months.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.227
She was my big earner.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.496
'Cause she was sleeping
with one of the guys?

31:37.529 --> 31:40.566
Because she had leverage.

31:40.599 --> 31:43.335
I don't know, maybe Brett
Chandler was gay or something.

31:43.369 --> 31:45.337
She didn't tell me.

31:45.371 --> 31:49.008
But she had dirt of some kind,
she knew how to use it.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.109
Blackmail.
DON: Right.

31:50.142 --> 31:52.711
And Logan said to Liz
that if he talked,

31:52.744 --> 31:54.646
everything would,
quote, come apart.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.615
Whatever Tracy knew, he knew, as
well. -Uh-huh.

31:56.648 --> 31:59.418
Yeah, see, what bothers me,
though, is that

31:59.451 --> 32:00.719
Tracy's been apparently
blackmailing Logan

32:00.752 --> 32:01.988
for months, right?

32:02.021 --> 32:03.655
DVDs in exchange
for her silence.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.524
But then,
she's suddenly murdered.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.459
Yeah, you know,
part of game theory

32:07.493 --> 32:09.962
is risk and
response analysis.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.999
It's like when a jackal is
circling a lion and her cub.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.567
The jackal presents a risk,
but as long as the jackal

32:15.601 --> 32:17.503
stalks at a distance,

32:17.536 --> 32:19.371
the risk he presents is low,

32:19.405 --> 32:21.407
so the lion's probably going
to tolerate him.

32:21.440 --> 32:24.310
On the other hand,
if the jackal comes too close,

32:24.343 --> 32:26.745
he crosses a line,
and the risk he presents

32:26.778 --> 32:27.946
becomes unacceptable
to the lion.

32:27.980 --> 32:30.549
The lion's response
will probably be lethal.

32:30.582 --> 32:33.152
Tracy demanding DVDs seems like
a low-risk situation to me,

32:33.185 --> 32:34.486
so something
must have changed.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.687
All right.

32:35.721 --> 32:37.123
It's basic
game theory again.

32:37.156 --> 32:38.357
I could walk you
through it.

32:38.390 --> 32:40.259
All right, I'll check
in with you later.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.129
Hey, Don, we got the kid
who shot the video, Pete Sears.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.264
He was at a friend's house
in Van Nuys.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.398
All right, good.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.702
Listen, I swear,
I got out of that house

32:50.736 --> 32:52.238
a few hours after filming that.

32:52.271 --> 32:54.106
Oh, yeah? Why?

32:54.140 --> 32:55.107
Why?

32:55.141 --> 32:59.278
Uh, well, there was a dead girl
in the bathtub.

32:59.311 --> 33:01.447
And Josh and Logan
said that they didn't

33:01.480 --> 33:03.115
want to tell anybody,
not even Brett.

33:03.149 --> 33:06.452
They just wanted to get rid
of her, so no one would know.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.620
What they just let you leave
with the video?

33:08.654 --> 33:11.690
No, um, I pretended
to erase it.

33:11.723 --> 33:14.193
You know, I kind of
played along there, you know?

33:14.226 --> 33:15.694
And then, all week,

33:15.727 --> 33:18.130
I'm watching the news,
and nothing's happened,

33:18.164 --> 33:19.031
so I feel like
I need to say something.

33:19.065 --> 33:21.733
I send the tape
to you guys.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.403
Listen...

33:24.436 --> 33:30.676
those aren't the same guys
that I grew up with, right?

33:30.709 --> 33:32.744
They've changed.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.091
Just so you know,
it hasn't escaped me

33:45.124 --> 33:46.758
that you're still
not working on your paper.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.760
Nothing gets past you, does it?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.829
Hey, Charlie, how do
we know this killer

33:50.862 --> 33:52.764
is gonna play according
to your rules?

33:52.798 --> 33:54.766
Uh, we don't-- not exactly.

33:54.800 --> 33:57.369
But game theory
gives us a model.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.672
Allows us to look at each
player in terms of strategy.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.108
The idea is that
each player

34:02.141 --> 34:04.376
works to maximize
their own return.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.378
What's the best way
to exploit the secret?

34:06.412 --> 34:08.547
What's the best strategy
to protect it?

34:08.580 --> 34:11.683
And at what point does it make
more sense for me to kill you,

34:11.717 --> 34:13.119
rather than pay you off.

34:13.152 --> 34:14.520
Hey, Charlie,
I'm looking

34:14.553 --> 34:15.721
for this box
of sprinkler parts

34:15.754 --> 34:16.655
and I know
you moved them.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.590
put 'em here in the garage,
did you see 'em?

34:18.624 --> 34:19.825
I put 'em over there.

34:19.858 --> 34:20.492
Where?

34:20.526 --> 34:22.628
Oh, they're by
the hoses.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.131
ALAN: Charlie cleaned out the
garage.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.366
Now I can't find
a damn thing.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.867
Something's bothering you.

34:28.900 --> 34:30.569
Yeah.

34:30.602 --> 34:31.837
This model...

34:31.870 --> 34:35.407
you know, Tracy was killed, but
the threat she posed remains.

34:35.441 --> 34:36.875
What do you mean?

34:36.908 --> 34:38.277
Well, you know
that analogy

34:38.310 --> 34:41.280
I gave about the lioness
and the jackal...

34:41.313 --> 34:43.215
Tracy might be dead,

34:43.249 --> 34:46.218
but the model is saying that
the jackal is still out there.

34:46.252 --> 34:48.420
Sounds like a Raymond
Chandler novel, huh?

34:48.454 --> 34:50.822
Murder, blackmail,
movie stars.

34:50.856 --> 34:53.259
Even got
the evil twins.

34:53.292 --> 34:55.327
Wait a minute, Alan--
I think you just said it.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.163
Said what?
What did I say?
The twins.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.398
Charlie, we confused
these girls before, right?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.499
Right.
-What if we're doing

35:00.532 --> 35:01.633
the same thing
right now.

35:01.667 --> 35:03.635
How about you plug in
Andrea Barton

35:03.669 --> 35:05.304
instead of Tracy Meade.

35:05.337 --> 35:07.439
Yeah.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.286
AMITA:
That's it.

35:20.319 --> 35:22.454
She's the missing piece.

35:33.899 --> 35:36.735
I was wondering
when you'd be back.

35:42.608 --> 35:43.842
MEGAN:
Love-2-love.

35:43.875 --> 35:45.644
That's your e-mail
address, isn't it?

35:45.677 --> 35:46.945
I'm not sure
why you're asking me.

35:46.978 --> 35:48.580
You obviously already know.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.249
We also know that you
were the blackmailer.

35:50.282 --> 35:51.717
Not Tracy.

35:51.750 --> 35:54.686
What is your leverage
on Brett Chandler?

35:54.720 --> 35:55.887
What's your big secret?

35:55.921 --> 35:57.723
What's it worth to you?

35:57.756 --> 36:00.259
Look, you're not really
in a position to deal here.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.727
I'm exactly
in a position to deal.

36:01.760 --> 36:02.961
I can help you catch a killer.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.296
That really depends

36:04.330 --> 36:06.298
on what you know.

36:06.332 --> 36:08.434
How about you tell us
how you found out?

36:08.467 --> 36:12.271
Logan told Tracy
something about Brett--

36:12.304 --> 36:13.605
pillow talk probably.

36:13.639 --> 36:15.674
Tracy couldn't wait
to tell me.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.343
She was really
into the "twins" thing,

36:17.376 --> 36:18.810
thought it made us
best friends.

36:18.844 --> 36:20.879
Mm, some friend.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.881
I didn't even know Tracy
before the surgeries.

36:22.914 --> 36:26.518
Okay, we were similar types,
so Leslie put us together.

36:26.552 --> 36:28.520
I saw an opportunity.

36:28.554 --> 36:30.756
And it doesn't
bother you

36:30.789 --> 36:32.924
that your "opportunity"
got Tracy killed?

36:32.958 --> 36:35.761
Like I said, it's not like
she was my real sister.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.564
(sighs)

36:38.597 --> 36:40.599
I'm getting bored.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.601
You want the information I have,

36:42.634 --> 36:45.704
guarantee I'm not charged
with the blackmail.

36:45.737 --> 36:48.006
You tell us or I'm gonna
guarantee you're charged

36:48.039 --> 36:50.709
as an accessory to murder,
as well as blackmail.

36:55.681 --> 36:59.451
What good is a secret,
if you can't share it anyway?

36:59.485 --> 37:01.420
You know
about Brett's brother...

37:01.453 --> 37:02.554
Brian.

37:02.588 --> 37:05.257
He was killed shortly
after he arrived here in LA--

37:05.291 --> 37:06.592
a carjacking.

37:06.625 --> 37:09.528
That's the story
Brett told the police.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.797
It isn't the real story.

37:13.899 --> 37:15.767
Guys.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.736
Didn't know you
were here.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.508
What? What is it?

37:22.541 --> 37:24.410
Secret's out, Brett.

37:24.443 --> 37:26.812
We know you killed your brother.

37:26.845 --> 37:29.681
Brian was killed
in a botched carjacking.

37:29.715 --> 37:30.682
Check with police.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.918
Well, I checked the LAPD file.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.053
And the funny thing is, the only
witnesses to the shooting

37:35.086 --> 37:36.622
were you,
Josh and Logan.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.956
And all three
of you guys

37:37.989 --> 37:39.325
gave the same account.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.659
And I don't mean

37:40.692 --> 37:42.361
that your statements
were consistent.

37:42.394 --> 37:43.429
They were identical.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.397
So?

37:45.431 --> 37:46.332
So there's always

37:46.365 --> 37:48.500
some variation
between witness testimony,

37:48.534 --> 37:50.502
unless the witnesses
happen to rehearse

37:50.536 --> 37:51.937
before the police
showed up.

37:53.805 --> 37:57.843
Look, you gotta know I never
would've hurt Brian, ever.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.545
I loved him.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.813
Then why don't you start showing
him the respect he deserves.

38:01.847 --> 38:02.914
Tell the truth.

38:02.948 --> 38:03.949
Stop acting.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.786
(sighs)

38:10.756 --> 38:12.758
It was a dumb, drunken accident.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.561
I had just landed
my first role.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.529
We were messing around
in the parking lot

38:17.563 --> 38:19.465
after celebrating in a bar.

38:19.498 --> 38:22.968
I was using the gun
as a... a prop,

38:23.001 --> 38:25.371
acting out my part.

38:26.472 --> 38:28.840
It went off.

38:31.743 --> 38:33.712
(sighs)

38:33.745 --> 38:36.081
I'm glad it's out.

38:36.114 --> 38:38.083
I am.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.951
They can't
hold it over me anymore.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.887
Who?
My guys.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.490
My "boyz."

38:44.523 --> 38:45.891
Why do you think I let them
live in my house,

38:45.924 --> 38:47.926
drive my cars,
and spend my money?

38:47.959 --> 38:50.396
If I them cut them off, it
wouldn't have been ten minutes

38:50.429 --> 38:52.030
before they sold me out
to the tabloids.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.566
That's what Logan meant

38:54.600 --> 38:56.635
when he said that everything
would come apart.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.036
Well, the thing is, Brett,

38:58.069 --> 39:00.972
the three of you
had the motive to kill.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.642
But with Logan dead,
that leaves just you and Josh.

39:03.675 --> 39:06.111
No.
Mark Green knew, too.

39:06.144 --> 39:09.080
And Josh was with me
when Logan was shot, so...

39:17.989 --> 39:19.425
You son of a bitch!

39:19.458 --> 39:20.992
You killed Logan?
Hey, hey, hang on...

39:26.064 --> 39:27.433
I'll try
and head him off.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.039
(gunshot)

39:34.072 --> 39:35.507
(people screaming)

39:37.543 --> 39:39.511
Don't come any closer.
(screams)

39:39.545 --> 39:40.912
All right,
now stay back.

39:40.946 --> 39:43.048
Where do you think
you're gonna go, Mark?

39:43.081 --> 39:43.982
Let go of the girl.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.717
Listen, man,
I got nothing left to lose.

39:45.751 --> 39:46.985
I'll kill her.
I swear.

39:47.018 --> 39:48.787
And then what do you think's
gonna happen?

39:48.820 --> 39:51.022
Drop it!

39:57.663 --> 39:58.897
You all right?

39:58.930 --> 40:00.499
COLBY:
Yeah. Fine.

40:09.140 --> 40:09.941
DON:
Good job, you guys.

40:09.975 --> 40:11.209
LIZ:
Thanks.

40:11.242 --> 40:13.144
Kinda doubt
it's what the ADIC had in mind

40:13.178 --> 40:15.080
when he told me
to sit tight, though, huh?

40:15.113 --> 40:17.983
So the manager's not talking,
but we've got his gun,

40:18.016 --> 40:19.618
so ballistics will tie him
to Logan's murder.

40:19.651 --> 40:21.787
Also, U.S. Attorney hopes
to leverage him

40:21.820 --> 40:22.821
for a confession on Tracy, too.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.794
Well, Brett's on the hook
for his brother's death,

40:28.827 --> 40:30.228
but as far as the
blackmail goes,

40:30.261 --> 40:31.096
he didn't know.

40:31.129 --> 40:33.064
Logan and Green
kept it from him, so...

40:33.098 --> 40:35.834
Just to protect their ends, huh?

40:35.867 --> 40:36.668
Look...

40:36.702 --> 40:38.136
this is from
the Director's Office.

40:38.169 --> 40:40.005
I wouldn't be surprised
if you could pick

40:40.038 --> 40:41.172
wherever you want
to go next.

40:49.648 --> 40:51.650
DAVID: Colby and I were pretty
tight.

40:51.683 --> 40:55.120
Everything went down,
and he looked dirty.

40:55.153 --> 40:58.824
I believed it.

40:58.857 --> 41:00.992
Is that what's
bothering you?

41:01.026 --> 41:02.961
Feel guilty?

41:05.163 --> 41:07.666
Maybe just proves we weren't
that tight to, uh...

41:07.699 --> 41:09.668
to begin with.

41:09.701 --> 41:12.003
Come on.

41:12.037 --> 41:13.972
You don't really
believe that.

41:25.717 --> 41:27.753
Okay, if you guys are ready,
let's go now, okay?

41:27.786 --> 41:28.887
Okay.

41:32.558 --> 41:33.992
Hey. -Hey!
Well, well.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.794
What's going on?
Um...

41:35.827 --> 41:38.263
Larry has invited us
to have dinner at the monastery.

41:38.296 --> 41:39.598
Oh, that sounds
different.

41:39.631 --> 41:40.932
LARRY: It's our monthly open
house.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.801
I just thought
it might break down

41:42.834 --> 41:45.036
some of the mystique
concerning my residency there.

41:45.070 --> 41:46.938
In other words, he's tired
of our stupid questions.

41:46.972 --> 41:48.173
He figured it would be better

41:48.206 --> 41:49.975
for us to take a look
ourselves.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.276
If you're free,
you're welcome to join us.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.278
Yeah.
Yeah, uh...

41:53.311 --> 41:55.881
Come on,
it sounds like fun.

41:55.914 --> 41:58.149
Tell you, prior to his
complete nervous breakdown,

41:58.183 --> 42:00.251
Brother Michael ran
a very successful restaurant

42:00.285 --> 42:01.286
right here in town.

42:01.319 --> 42:02.621
We'd love to go.

42:02.654 --> 42:03.955
(chuckles)
Right?

42:03.989 --> 42:05.624
I guess what she said.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.059
Okay, I'll go see
what's taking Charlie so long.

42:11.697 --> 42:13.665
Charlie, are you
ready to go?

42:13.699 --> 42:16.602
Oh.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.169
Are you writing?

42:18.203 --> 42:19.705
The block's gone.
I've got it now.

42:19.738 --> 42:20.772
What changed?

42:20.806 --> 42:23.575
My observation of
Brett Chandler and his friends,

42:23.609 --> 42:24.876
or Colby coming back,

42:24.910 --> 42:26.344
or could've even been
you and Larry.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.979
But I know what
I want to say

42:28.013 --> 42:29.648
about friendship now.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.850
I know what goes along
with the math.

42:32.918 --> 42:34.853
Good.

42:36.822 --> 42:38.657
I'm glad to hear it.
