00:02.037 --> 00:03.841
<i>Managing the runway
is one of the most
importantthings</i>

00:03.841 --> 00:05.511
<i>a model can
learn how to do.</i>

00:05.511 --> 00:06.680
I'm gonna be flat out
honest and say that Binta

00:06.680 --> 00:07.949
scares the ( bleep )
out of me.

00:07.949 --> 00:09.185
Where did y'all people
come from?

00:09.185 --> 00:10.588
They didn't come
from my people.

00:10.588 --> 00:11.791
We don't know
where we come from.

00:11.791 --> 00:13.427
- You come from us?
- No, we do not.

00:13.427 --> 00:16.867
Law's friends with
Zendaya. Oh, my God!

00:16.867 --> 00:18.538
Put your legs together.

00:18.538 --> 00:20.542
Gotta bring your leg over.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.645
If she shows that pussycat
one more time...

00:22.645 --> 00:26.052
<i>The model who gets to
stay this week, Coryanne.</i>

00:26.052 --> 00:29.058
- Justine, I'm so sorry.
- <i>I wanted this</i>

00:29.058 --> 00:30.393
really, really badly.

01:18.891 --> 01:23.033
<i>Well, ladies, we made it.
We made it.</i>

01:23.033 --> 01:25.872
We made it to our first
elimination.

01:25.872 --> 01:29.245
When they said,
"Justine, you are leaving,"

01:29.245 --> 01:31.182
my heart just sunk,

01:31.182 --> 01:33.554
<i>but that's when I knew
this was a real deal.</i>

01:33.554 --> 01:35.625
Somebody's gonna leave
every week.

01:35.625 --> 01:38.029
That's okay.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.937
Beautiful.
You were so worried.

01:41.937 --> 01:43.541
Tatiana:
<i>Cody wins best photo.</i>

01:43.541 --> 01:45.043
<i>I mean, I think she looked
absolutely popping.</i>

01:45.043 --> 01:46.112
<i>Like, her face
looked amazing.</i>

01:46.112 --> 01:47.549
Beautiful, yeah?

01:47.549 --> 01:50.086
She's definitely
big competition for sure.

01:50.086 --> 01:52.191
<i>I've never seen
you do that.</i>

01:52.191 --> 01:54.195
<i>I was looking at it,
like, damn.</i>

01:54.195 --> 01:57.970
When I see my sister
succeed it gives me
encouragement,

01:57.970 --> 02:00.441
and we practically
share the same face,

02:00.441 --> 02:03.614
so it's kinda like,
if she can do it, I can do it.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.292
Courtney:
I think the twins,
they're a little bit

02:09.292 --> 02:10.962
<i>too confident right now.</i>

02:10.962 --> 02:13.266
Me, personally,
that's not my style.

02:13.266 --> 02:15.905
<i>because you never know
what might happen.</i>

02:15.905 --> 02:19.045
- I'm proud of you, baby.
- I don't wanna go home.

02:19.045 --> 02:20.648
Like, every day I'm praying,
"I don't wanna go home."

02:20.648 --> 02:21.951
But I was like,
"I don't want to be bottom two."

02:21.951 --> 02:23.921
It was like, no,
not the bottom two.

02:23.921 --> 02:25.625
Like that was the worst,
because I was like,

02:25.625 --> 02:27.061
I have hella friends
that are models.

02:27.061 --> 02:28.463
Everybody's gonna be like,
"Cory, wow."

02:28.463 --> 02:29.799
- Yeah.
- And I was like--

02:29.799 --> 02:31.637
Even my parents.
Even my mom.

02:31.637 --> 02:33.006
Everybody's putting
this pressure on me
about my mom.

02:33.006 --> 02:34.976
My mom's gonna
be like, "Wow."

02:34.976 --> 02:37.582
Last elimination I ended
up in the bottom two

02:37.582 --> 02:39.853
and I was very
embarrassed.

02:39.853 --> 02:41.924
<i>I'm a signed model. I
have been for a while now.</i>

02:41.924 --> 02:44.328
And I came in feeling
very in confident,

02:44.328 --> 02:45.966
and I'm, like,
not anymore.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.869
I wanna be broken down
to be built up.

02:47.869 --> 02:49.472
Coryanne:
I want criticism,
about me,

02:49.472 --> 02:51.610
<i>not about my mama.</i>

02:51.610 --> 02:53.246
<i>My mom was a supermodel,
but I didn't grow up
with my mom.</i>

02:53.246 --> 02:54.983
<i>I grew up in Bali
with my dad.</i>

02:54.983 --> 02:56.620
She was an incredible model,
but I'm not like her.

02:56.620 --> 02:57.989
I'm never gonna be her.

02:57.989 --> 02:59.959
I'm never gonna
have her career.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.164
And I don't want that career.
I wanna be a star.

03:02.164 --> 03:03.534
This goddamn mom thing.

03:05.170 --> 03:06.306
Come on, girls.

03:06.306 --> 03:09.880
<i>Rita alert!</i>

03:09.880 --> 03:13.987
Hi, ladies.
I hope you're taking in all
of our advice and critiques,

03:13.987 --> 03:16.827
as we expect to you raise
and improve your game

03:16.827 --> 03:18.898
at every photo shoot.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.701
All right, see you soon.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.304
What the hell?

03:22.304 --> 03:24.810
<i>With each photo shoot,
which means tomorrow</i>

03:24.810 --> 03:27.515
<i>we're probably gonna
have a photo shoot.</i>

03:27.515 --> 03:30.622
Krislian: <i>Photo shoots make
me nervous because I feel like
the judges</i>

03:30.622 --> 03:32.859
have me in this mold.

03:32.859 --> 03:36.867
You sell sex,
is what I'm gathering.

03:36.867 --> 03:39.305
<i>I'm Latina, I'm short,
I have a big butt,</i>

03:39.305 --> 03:43.212
so I still have to convince
them that I'm high fashion,

03:43.212 --> 03:44.984
and I have to nail
every single shot.

03:44.984 --> 03:46.854
And I hope you're taking
all of our advice

03:46.854 --> 03:48.557
- <i>and getting better.</i>
-And improving.

03:48.557 --> 03:50.026
Cherish:
<i>Panel didn't go
as we expected,</i>

03:50.026 --> 03:52.532
and being in the bottom
three really woke me up.

03:52.532 --> 03:53.868
<i>I know how to
take a photo.</i>

03:53.868 --> 03:56.071
So, you bet
your sweet ass,

03:56.071 --> 03:58.209
I'm just gonna blow this photo
shoot out of the water.

03:58.209 --> 04:01.182
<i>Gotta be up
and ready to go at 9:00 AM,</i>

04:01.182 --> 04:02.250
<i>so, let's kick it.</i>

04:05.725 --> 04:07.428
<i>- ( coughing )
- Let's play Uno.</i>

04:07.428 --> 04:09.666
I feel very
sick right now.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.003
I was like, "Oh, no!"

04:12.003 --> 04:13.608
All I wanna do
is go to sleep.

04:13.608 --> 04:15.410
I'm like, that's
what it comes down to.

04:15.410 --> 04:18.050
<i>But these girls
won't stop talking.</i>

04:18.050 --> 04:19.418
Ugh!

04:19.418 --> 04:21.255
- ( indistinct
conversation ) - ( Courtney
coughing )

04:24.428 --> 04:26.031
Well, you have to hear it.

04:28.169 --> 04:30.508
<i>Courtney has
the supermodel attitude</i>

04:30.508 --> 04:32.912
and I don't know
if she's quite earned it.

04:32.912 --> 04:36.587
Every minute, getting hurt.
"I'm hurt, I'm getting sick."

04:36.587 --> 04:38.690
Everybody's hurting.
Everybody's going through
something.

04:38.690 --> 04:40.862
The right thing to do
when someone is sick

04:40.862 --> 04:42.599
<i>- is to let them sleep.
- So that's how you feel
about it.</i>

04:42.599 --> 04:45.270
- If you guys were sick.
- You were acting
like an adult,

04:45.270 --> 04:46.740
<i>you would've said,
"I'm going downstairs
to go to sleep."</i>

04:46.740 --> 04:48.276
Yeah, ( bleep )

04:48.276 --> 04:50.113
you guys look like
you're having a good time.

04:50.113 --> 04:52.952
and I don't wanna
ruin it for you,

04:52.952 --> 04:54.623
- <i>so I'm gonna go
downstairs.</i> - Take myself
downstairs where it's quiet.

04:54.623 --> 04:57.494
- Like, what the ( bleep
). - You were a ( bleep ).

04:57.494 --> 04:59.231
<i>I think it's funny that
you think you're gonna stay</i>

04:59.231 --> 05:01.235
<i>in this competition
with that attitude.</i>

05:01.235 --> 05:03.206
<i>You can't just bring
on this victim.</i>

05:03.206 --> 05:05.443
<i>You're not even staying
in this room,</i>

05:05.443 --> 05:06.613
<i>so how is this
your fight?</i>

05:06.613 --> 05:07.548
Because I was in here,
wasn't I?

05:07.548 --> 05:10.287
Marissa, this is not your fight.

05:10.287 --> 05:12.491
Are you telling me--
everybody go to sleep?
We don't have bedtime.

05:12.491 --> 05:16.566
I asked you nicely
if you guys could please
shut down in 15 minutes.

05:16.566 --> 05:20.340
15 minutes later?
"Guys, I have to wake up
at six in the morning.

05:20.340 --> 05:22.845
Will you guys please
( bleep ) lights ( bleep )?"

05:22.845 --> 05:26.820
- I did not say it like that.
-This is not the Courtney
( bleep ) show!

05:26.820 --> 05:28.958
You are not
the goddamn victim

05:28.958 --> 05:31.162
and I'm gonna leave before
I look like the goddamn bully.

05:31.162 --> 05:32.198
( bleep )

05:32.198 --> 05:34.536
I am very bitchy
and I let it be known

05:34.536 --> 05:35.972
when I don't like someone.

05:35.972 --> 05:38.076
You're very selfish.

05:38.076 --> 05:42.986
It's just a little
annoying to be with such a
downer all the time.

05:42.986 --> 05:45.290
Look, ( bleep )
"America's Next Top Model"

05:45.290 --> 05:48.697
cannot be decided by everybody
in the goddamn house.

05:48.697 --> 05:50.033
She's so captivating
in the face,

05:50.033 --> 05:52.103
but she definitely
lacks personality.

05:52.103 --> 05:53.607
It's not okay.

05:59.284 --> 06:01.155
Everybody knows Courtney
looks like a model.

06:01.155 --> 06:02.725
She's like ( bleep )
beautiful.

06:02.725 --> 06:05.396
All I did was I asked them
if they could go to sleep

06:05.396 --> 06:06.834
in 15 minutes.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.370
It doesn't matter
how much she complains.

06:08.370 --> 06:10.006
She feels like all the girls
are talking about her

06:10.006 --> 06:11.844
because she's one
of the biggest threats.

06:11.844 --> 06:13.279
Duh.

06:13.279 --> 06:15.216
I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go.

06:18.389 --> 06:20.027
What's going on
with Courtney?

06:20.027 --> 06:21.329
I just talked to her,
and what she told me,

06:21.329 --> 06:22.966
it's like, not cool with me.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.236
What I love about Cherish
is that she has the willingness

06:25.236 --> 06:26.707
to just take on whatever.

06:26.707 --> 06:28.844
She told me that she came
in here and she said,

06:28.844 --> 06:31.382
"Can you guys
go to sleep in 15 minutes,
I'm not feeling good,"

06:31.382 --> 06:33.186
<i>and then you guys
all attacked her
and said that--</i>

06:33.186 --> 06:34.488
<i>- Not all of us--
- No.</i>

06:34.488 --> 06:36.258
<i>Or it was-- let me finish,
let me finish.</i>

06:36.258 --> 06:41.035
So, you guys think that it
was the best possible way

06:41.035 --> 06:43.574
for everyone
to let it all out--

06:43.574 --> 06:46.546
Pumping that skin up,
like it has to happen.

06:46.546 --> 06:49.752
- <i>You know what I mean?</i>
- Sure, it's okay.
She's a big girl.

06:49.752 --> 06:51.356
<i>Like, I get it.
Whatever.</i>

06:51.356 --> 06:52.525
<i>Sleep on it.</i>

06:54.061 --> 06:55.496
( alarm buzzes )

07:05.919 --> 07:06.753
Hi.

07:08.089 --> 07:09.926
- Good morning.
- All: Good morning.

07:09.926 --> 07:11.429
Tatiana:
<i>We show up in a studio.</i>

07:11.429 --> 07:12.932
<i>Rita's there with Drew</i>

07:12.932 --> 07:14.970
and I have no idea
what to expect.

07:14.970 --> 07:18.777
As you can see,
you're standing on the set
of your next photo shoot.

07:18.777 --> 07:20.681
<i>- All right?
- Fine.</i>

07:20.681 --> 07:25.223
Today's hair and make-up
is gonna be a little more
intense than usual.

07:27.127 --> 07:29.933
Most every fashion icon
has a trademark style

07:29.933 --> 07:31.737
<i>that makes them
completely stand out.</i>

07:31.737 --> 07:33.641
<i>Take Ariana Grande's
long ponytail,</i>

07:33.641 --> 07:35.578
<i>Alek Wek's shaved head,</i>

07:35.578 --> 07:37.114
<i>Beyoncé's golden locks,</i>

07:37.114 --> 07:39.720
<i>and me with blond hair
and red lips.</i>

07:39.720 --> 07:41.590
When I honed in
on my signature style,

07:41.590 --> 07:45.130
that's when
I got a Rimmel London
cosmetic contract.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.134
So we've created
a trademark look
for each of you.

07:47.134 --> 07:49.706
( cheering )

07:49.706 --> 07:53.446
Inside of these envelopes
are the secret ingredients

07:53.446 --> 07:55.617
- for the new you.
- Oh, yeah.

07:58.089 --> 08:00.794
Most of my experience
is in commercial print work.

08:00.794 --> 08:02.464
<i>I was in an American
Eagle campaign,</i>

08:02.464 --> 08:05.571
<i>but to be a supermodel,
you have to have "it,"</i>

08:05.571 --> 08:07.642
<i>so I'm excited
to step it up,</i>

08:07.642 --> 08:10.782
but I'm hoping
that I can still be myself.

08:10.782 --> 08:12.484
- Yes!
- Paige!

08:12.484 --> 08:14.789
( cheering )

08:14.789 --> 08:18.496
So my makeover card
says "box shave"

08:18.496 --> 08:21.002
and I think "high top."

08:21.002 --> 08:22.171
Wow.

08:22.171 --> 08:23.306
There's no way
I'm getting a high top.

08:23.306 --> 08:25.010
Get it out of your head.

08:25.010 --> 08:28.249
Look, look!
I'm getting
a bob with ombre.

08:28.249 --> 08:32.357
So, what I got was
fairy dust lavender rainbow.

08:32.357 --> 08:33.794
What does that even mean?

08:33.794 --> 08:36.365
Okay, girls, so you're
going to head next door

08:36.365 --> 08:38.169
to the Sally Hershberger
Salon.

08:38.169 --> 08:40.206
- Are you ready
to get glammed?
- ( cheering )

08:40.206 --> 08:41.509
Go, go!

08:43.514 --> 08:46.385
Cherish:
<i>My paper said my hair
was gonna be fiery red,</i>

08:46.385 --> 08:49.726
and it scared me.
I'm gonna be
a big redhead?

08:49.726 --> 08:52.197
I did the model.
This is who I am.

08:52.197 --> 08:56.005
Being the redhead,
freckled girl my whole life,
I've been called ugly,

08:56.005 --> 08:58.510
<i>so I learned
how to love myself,</i>

08:58.510 --> 09:01.850
and now I feel like
they're just gonna
change who I am.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.554
How do you know
it's gonna be red red,
right?

09:03.554 --> 09:05.023
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.

09:05.023 --> 09:07.695
- Cherish, you all right?
- This is my hair.

09:07.695 --> 09:09.866
Every strand
is a different color.

09:09.866 --> 09:11.837
It's gold,
it's yellow, it's red.

09:11.837 --> 09:13.907
Marissa:
<i>Like, all they're doing
is enhancing the color,</i>

09:13.907 --> 09:15.210
<i>and she just
started crying</i>

09:15.210 --> 09:16.680
<i>and started breaking
down about it.</i>

09:16.680 --> 09:19.051
I think that's
crazy and stupid.

09:19.051 --> 09:22.090
I'm joking, I'm joking,
but, no, I'm really not.

09:22.090 --> 09:24.227
Nobody has this hair,
so you're gonna bottle my hair

09:24.227 --> 09:26.165
to make it look like
everyone can get?

09:26.165 --> 09:28.202
Cherish is freaking out
over becoming a redhead

09:28.202 --> 09:29.706
and she's already redhead.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.209
She wasn't really
acting like a boss.

09:31.209 --> 09:32.578
She was acting
like a baby.

09:37.521 --> 09:39.025
<i>Let me be me.</i>

09:39.025 --> 09:41.229
<i>I'm a girly girl.
I wear skirts.</i>

09:41.229 --> 09:43.066
<i>That is who I am.</i>

09:43.066 --> 09:47.575
- So you guys obviously
saw that I just did this.
- ( laughing )

09:47.575 --> 09:52.551
When I watched you on set,
I just am not confident
that you're a model.

10:03.373 --> 10:04.943
- <i>Hi, by the way, I'm
Sally.</i> -Hi.

10:04.943 --> 10:06.880
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.251
- I'm so excited,
you have no idea.
- I'm so excited.

10:09.251 --> 10:12.558
- You're in major
good hands here.
- I can tell.

10:12.558 --> 10:14.629
Awesome.
Awesome, awesome.

10:14.629 --> 10:17.367
Fabulous.

10:17.367 --> 10:19.305
Are you excited
for your makeover?

10:19.305 --> 10:21.041
I can't wait.
I'm so excited.

10:21.041 --> 10:22.779
You just have
such strong features.

10:22.779 --> 10:25.584
- that we're just trying
to bring that out.
- Yeah, thank you.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.755
<i>My trademark look card says,
"Bigger and better."</i>

10:27.755 --> 10:32.598
Just perfect thing for
me-- I'm going to be that bitch.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.902
I need to feel girly.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.272
Girl, you're gonna look great.

10:36.272 --> 10:38.577
This is gonna be
just so exciting for you.

10:38.577 --> 10:41.415
You know, my sister and I,
my sister is an androgynous
model,

10:41.415 --> 10:44.254
I'm very girly, and, you
know, I don't wanna be
masculine.

10:44.254 --> 10:45.757
<i>We're not asking
to do that.</i>

10:45.757 --> 10:48.597
We're not asking to change
how you are or how you act.

10:48.597 --> 10:52.571
I just wanna give you something
that people go, "That's her."

10:52.571 --> 10:54.441
I'm just like really
trying to stay positive,

10:54.441 --> 10:57.114
<i>but when he took
those clippers out,</i>

10:57.114 --> 10:59.786
<i>it was a little scary.</i>

10:59.786 --> 11:01.421
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

11:01.421 --> 11:03.125
- We're gonna make
it like really--
- Red?

11:03.125 --> 11:04.461
We love her hair.

11:04.461 --> 11:06.633
What do you mean?
What do you mean by this?

11:06.633 --> 11:08.436
- Huh?
- What do you mean
by redder?

11:08.436 --> 11:11.108
You need to brighten up
your hair color.

11:11.108 --> 11:15.116
I-- I honestly, um,
hi, I'm Cherish.

11:15.116 --> 11:16.819
Hi, I'm Sally.
Nice to meet you.

11:16.819 --> 11:18.456
- Thank you for having
me in your salon.
- God.

11:18.456 --> 11:20.360
Yeah, I loved it.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.500
My hair is virgin hair,
it's never been touched.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.669
<i>Honey, if you're gonna
be a model,</i>

11:24.669 --> 11:26.472
you gotta get
used to this.

11:26.472 --> 11:29.277
- I understand.
- You're not gonna be
a virgin for very long.

11:29.277 --> 11:32.985
I know, but the one thing
that I won't change is, like--

11:32.985 --> 11:34.387
It'll be awesome.

11:37.662 --> 11:41.201
<i>If I am to do this,
my hair won't ever
be the same.</i>

11:43.974 --> 11:46.946
You have such beautiful
hair, do you know that?

11:48.482 --> 11:50.954
It's not changing it.
We're emphasizing the color

11:50.954 --> 11:52.490
<i>you already
actually have.</i>

11:52.490 --> 11:57.000
Do you know Sally Hershberger
does hair for Gigi Hadid...

11:57.000 --> 11:59.505
- Julia Roberts.
- Christy Turlington.

11:59.505 --> 12:01.475
<i>Linda Evangelista.
Joselle.</i>

12:01.475 --> 12:03.012
- Hello?
- Whoo!

12:03.012 --> 12:04.849
- Come on!
- All right.

12:04.849 --> 12:05.416
Sally:
<i>All right.</i>

12:10.360 --> 12:12.096
<i>Hey, girls.</i>

12:12.096 --> 12:13.198
All: Hi.

12:13.198 --> 12:15.538
- What up?
- How are you guys doing?

12:15.538 --> 12:16.673
All: Good.

12:16.673 --> 12:17.875
<i>So, as you all know,</i>

12:17.875 --> 12:19.745
we created these
trademark looks for you,

12:19.745 --> 12:24.020
and these trademark looks
are going to be the only thing

12:24.020 --> 12:25.858
that you wear
at your next photo shoot.

12:25.858 --> 12:27.661
( gasps, cheers )

12:27.661 --> 12:31.368
That's right, you are going
to be posing completely nude.

12:31.368 --> 12:33.874
( cheering )

12:33.874 --> 12:36.378
India:
I always told myself
I would never pose nude.

12:36.378 --> 12:40.687
I really do want to win
this, but I am so scared.

12:40.687 --> 12:42.357
<i>So, when you guys
are finished here,</i>

12:42.357 --> 12:45.096
you're gonna be shooting
your nude photo shoot,

12:45.096 --> 12:47.701
but you're going
to be doing it in groups,

12:47.701 --> 12:50.340
so this is a time to really
work together as a team.

12:50.340 --> 12:53.747
<i>Nude celebrity photos
are so popular now.</i>

12:53.747 --> 12:57.287
<i>I have shot nude a million
and a half times.</i>

12:57.287 --> 12:59.257
We're shooting something
that's beautiful.

12:59.257 --> 13:01.228
We're shooting fashion,
elegance.

13:01.228 --> 13:04.769
Your body is your fashion,

13:04.769 --> 13:09.779
And you are going to be shot
by one of the most famous

13:09.779 --> 13:11.917
photographers
in the entire world,

13:11.917 --> 13:13.386
<i>Who? Who? Who?</i>

13:13.386 --> 13:16.660
<i>One of my favorites,
Ellen Von Unwerth.</i>

13:16.660 --> 13:17.762
<i>( cheering )</i>

13:17.762 --> 13:19.498
Ellen is so amazing.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.503
<i>She's a badass
photographer.</i>

13:21.503 --> 13:23.306
<i>Everything she
does is bomb.</i>

13:23.306 --> 13:25.476
<i>She's so free
and so cool.</i>

13:25.476 --> 13:28.048
<i>I'm so happy that we're
shooting with her.</i>

13:28.048 --> 13:29.217
<i>She makes everyone
look so good.</i>

13:42.477 --> 13:43.445
<i>Good luck!</i>

13:43.445 --> 13:45.618
Thank you, guys.
See you over there.

13:45.618 --> 13:47.120
- Bye!
- <i>Bye!</i>

13:49.826 --> 13:54.969
I feel like
you're just gonna come out
looking like a superstar.

13:54.969 --> 13:57.073
<i>I'm getting
a sassy-ass bob.</i>

13:57.073 --> 14:01.783
I look like an alien right now,
but when I get out of this,
I'm gonna be fly.

14:01.783 --> 14:03.419
It really worked.

14:03.419 --> 14:05.190
It looks great.

14:05.190 --> 14:07.093
That's what I want.
I want you to walk into a room

14:07.093 --> 14:08.697
and every photographer
will be like

14:08.697 --> 14:11.034
"That's her.
That's India."

14:13.139 --> 14:15.811
As a competition,
I would like us to make you

14:15.811 --> 14:18.784
look girly, because
then I'll be the edgy one.

14:18.784 --> 14:21.021
You don't want to be edgy.
That's why you're not gonna
make it in this business.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.491
<i>You don't want
to be girly.</i>

14:22.491 --> 14:23.894
<i>They switched our looks.</i>

14:23.894 --> 14:26.899
<i>I identify
as being the tomboy</i>

14:26.899 --> 14:29.138
<i>and my sister identifies
as being the girly girl,</i>

14:29.138 --> 14:31.943
but I'm not scared to get
something new.

14:31.943 --> 14:33.479
Rita:
Okay, girls,
I'm gonna leave you

14:33.479 --> 14:35.483
<i>with Ashley and Drew
for your photo shoot.</i>

14:35.483 --> 14:38.523
<i>I'll see you later
at panel. Good luck.</i>

14:38.523 --> 14:41.563
I think we did a good job.

14:41.563 --> 14:44.802
Tash:
<i>I feel like my makeover's
very masculine</i>

14:44.802 --> 14:47.007
<i>and we're posing
nude today,</i>

14:47.007 --> 14:50.313
and looking like a boy
kinda bothers me.

14:50.313 --> 14:53.185
You know, it's a little
hard to look at myself.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.201
Courtney:
<i>Tash is a little upset,</i>

15:01.201 --> 15:02.871
<i>which I don't really
feel bad about,</i>

15:02.871 --> 15:06.178
<i>because last night, both
of the twins came at me,</i>

15:06.178 --> 15:08.750
and I'm not saying
karma's real,

15:08.750 --> 15:10.754
but, like, karma's
definitely real.

15:29.424 --> 15:33.398
Tash, you're crushing
Courtney a little.

15:33.398 --> 15:35.537
<i>This might be the
photo shoot I can't do.</i>

15:46.593 --> 15:48.428
Tash:
<i>Let me be me.</i>

15:56.880 --> 15:58.950
Marissa:
Tash really didn't like
her hair.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.127
But I'm absolutely
loving my makeover.

16:04.127 --> 16:06.633
I just wanna flip my hair
and make all the girls

16:06.633 --> 16:08.603
that got their hair cut,
like, super pissy.

16:11.041 --> 16:12.644
Ashley:
<i>What's the problem?</i>

16:12.644 --> 16:16.451
I know-- I'm just saying
that I know who I am.

16:16.451 --> 16:18.289
I know who I am
on the inside.

16:18.289 --> 16:20.928
<i>I'm flirty, I'm sexy,
I'm a seductress.</i>

16:20.928 --> 16:23.834
This is when the brand,
the boss, and the business

16:23.834 --> 16:25.504
- separate.
- Yeah.

16:25.504 --> 16:26.773
Because at the end
of the day your look

16:26.773 --> 16:27.942
is probably always
gonna be changing.

16:27.942 --> 16:29.410
<i>- Right.
- Right.</i>

16:29.410 --> 16:30.814
- I'ma worry about my
look. - Right.

16:30.814 --> 16:32.685
- And I'm gonna go slay.
- Right.

16:32.685 --> 16:34.622
- Because that's what
a boss does.
- Does.

16:34.622 --> 16:37.426
- And I'm a boss.
- Yes.

16:37.426 --> 16:38.296
- I see a boss.
- Thank you.

16:38.296 --> 16:39.999
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.669
- I'm gonna see you
at the shoot.
- Yes.

16:51.823 --> 16:53.794
I actually love
everybody's look so far.

16:53.794 --> 16:55.531
Now that we all have
our makeovers,

16:55.531 --> 16:58.102
<i>some people feel
less confident</i>

16:58.102 --> 16:59.705
<i>and others feel
a lot more confident</i>

16:59.705 --> 17:01.442
Beauty is pain, baby.

17:01.442 --> 17:03.814
<i>I don't have this
attachment to my hair</i>

17:03.814 --> 17:05.784
that a lot of women do.

17:05.784 --> 17:07.555
I'm surprised yours was
done as fast as it was.

17:07.555 --> 17:09.390
- Six hours?
- Six hours.

17:09.390 --> 17:10.359
Not that bad.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.199
Binta was pretty quick.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.737
I'm not very flattered
that they would choose
this for me.

17:15.737 --> 17:17.106
It's definitely
something different.

17:17.106 --> 17:18.175
Courtney:
<i>It looks like a smurf</i>

17:18.175 --> 17:20.012
<i>( bleep ) your head.</i>

17:20.012 --> 17:21.048
In a good way.

17:21.048 --> 17:22.383
<i>"My Little Pony"!</i>

17:22.383 --> 17:23.854
If you're ever
looking for me, just say,

17:23.854 --> 17:25.022
"Oh, the one
with the purple hair."

17:25.022 --> 17:26.024
Here we go.

17:26.024 --> 17:27.026
Come on in.

17:27.026 --> 17:28.696
All: Ah!

17:28.696 --> 17:32.336
Now girls, this
is how you do it.

17:32.336 --> 17:33.707
( all yelling )

17:33.707 --> 17:36.145
- You want a picture with
me? - Wow! Yes!

17:36.145 --> 17:38.082
Take if off and come on.

17:38.082 --> 17:39.652
Yeah!
( laughs )

17:43.092 --> 17:46.999
Lots of pearls.
Pearls all over the body.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.004
I was there when
Kim Kardashian got naked

17:49.004 --> 17:52.476
but she ain't got
anything on you guys.

17:54.848 --> 17:56.886
Perfect.

17:56.886 --> 17:58.388
<i>I don't know it it's me
being self-conscious,</i>

17:58.388 --> 18:00.159
but I just can't whip
off a robe

18:00.159 --> 18:02.230
and be like, "Okay, yeah,
well, let's go run around
naked."

18:02.230 --> 18:03.833
It's just not me.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.203
<i>This might be
the photo shoot</i>

18:05.203 --> 18:06.404
<i>I can't do.</i>

18:08.275 --> 18:11.248
So you guys obviously saw
that I just did this.

18:11.248 --> 18:13.052
- Hello.
- Whoo!

18:13.052 --> 18:14.756
I've got curves,
I've got cellulite,

18:14.756 --> 18:16.693
I got things that
I don't like about myself,

18:16.693 --> 18:19.264
or that people told me
that I shouldn't like
about myself,

18:19.264 --> 18:21.903
so any of you who feel
self-conscious right now,

18:21.903 --> 18:23.906
remember, I just took
all my clothes off,

18:23.906 --> 18:26.378
so own your confidence,
all right?

18:26.378 --> 18:27.782
All: Yes.

18:27.782 --> 18:29.785
All right.
Do it!

18:29.785 --> 18:31.756
And now that we see
that you're not shy,

18:31.756 --> 18:33.927
I'm going to put
you guys into groups

18:33.927 --> 18:36.098
and then we will
start our shoot.

18:36.098 --> 18:38.068
The first group
is going to be Krislian,

18:38.068 --> 18:41.475
- Cherish, and Binta.
- All: Whoo!

18:41.475 --> 18:43.045
Let's go.

18:43.045 --> 18:45.751
The important thing
to remember in a group shot

18:45.751 --> 18:46.987
is to work as a team

18:46.987 --> 18:49.056
and to make sure
that everyone looks good.

18:49.056 --> 18:51.629
Ellen:
Just concentrate on the hair,
not on the rest.

18:51.629 --> 18:54.000
Yeah, 'cause that's
the transformation.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.539
So I popped my
virgin cherry.

18:56.539 --> 18:59.879
Drew: <i>Remember the trademark
style, so make sure hair
lit.</i>

18:59.879 --> 19:01.615
My hair won't ever
be the same.

19:01.615 --> 19:04.120
Now I have to be
a bottled redhead.

19:04.120 --> 19:05.256
Ellen:
<i>Put the hand on her.</i>

19:05.256 --> 19:06.926
There.

19:06.926 --> 19:08.896
Binta:
Cherish is too attached
to her hair color.

19:08.896 --> 19:10.466
She'd better
put a smile on,

19:10.466 --> 19:11.736
and act like
she's happy right now.

19:11.736 --> 19:14.842
If she does not
they might send her home.

19:14.842 --> 19:16.177
Ellen:
<i>Look over here.</i>

19:16.177 --> 19:17.781
<i>( camera clicking )</i>

19:17.781 --> 19:20.353
Krislian: <i>I absolutely
hate my hair.</i>

19:20.353 --> 19:23.827
I haven't had fringe like
this since I was five.

19:23.827 --> 19:26.766
<i>This definitely is testing
my confidence.</i>

19:26.766 --> 19:31.141
Drew:
Krislian, you have to watch
that video vixen mentality.

19:31.141 --> 19:33.412
I want you to like think
like expensive.

19:33.412 --> 19:34.749
<i>Too much.</i>

19:34.749 --> 19:36.451
I think we're good.

19:36.451 --> 19:39.324
My hair is like my trademark,
and that color is very rare.

19:39.324 --> 19:42.832
It's like saying
like they would like dye
your skin a different color.

19:42.832 --> 19:46.171
Homegirl is like bugging.
She's crazy.

19:46.171 --> 19:47.106
That's all I can say.

19:51.616 --> 19:55.022
Thanks, ladies.
Love you, too.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.197
Ellen:
<i>Touch her butt.</i>

19:59.197 --> 19:59.999
<i>That's nice.</i>

19:59.999 --> 20:02.638
<i>Put both arms around her.</i>

20:02.638 --> 20:03.973
<i>Gorgeous, yeah.
Nice.</i>

20:03.973 --> 20:06.044
Cody:
I look like a dude
in a damned wig.

20:06.044 --> 20:08.517
but as soon as that photo
snaps, I'm gonna look like a
lady,

20:08.517 --> 20:09.785
and that's all
that matters.

20:09.785 --> 20:11.054
Use your leg to cover.

20:11.054 --> 20:12.691
<i>- There you go.
- Yeah.</i>

20:12.691 --> 20:14.060
Drew:
Get closer, yeah.
There you go.

20:14.060 --> 20:15.028
<i>That's nice.</i>

20:15.028 --> 20:16.464
Obviously being
in the bottom two

20:16.464 --> 20:18.169
I have a lot
more pressure on me.

20:18.169 --> 20:19.872
Drew:
<i>Trademark looks,
work the hair.</i>

20:19.872 --> 20:21.742
And so this long hair
just kinda give me confidence.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.178
Drew:
<i>That's it.</i>

20:23.178 --> 20:25.482
I know I did a lot better.
but I just hope I did

20:25.482 --> 20:26.586
a lot better
than everyone else.

20:26.586 --> 20:28.022
Ellen:
<i>Amazing.</i>

20:28.022 --> 20:29.056
Hey, girl.

20:29.056 --> 20:30.727
Are you okay?

20:30.727 --> 20:32.396
It's not just you doing--

20:32.396 --> 20:34.401
No, but all you guys just
like whip off your robes,

20:34.401 --> 20:36.372
no problem, and I'm like,
"Are you serious?"

20:36.372 --> 20:38.543
I'm not.
I went to a private
Catholic school.

20:38.543 --> 20:41.716
- So did I.
- I've been to Burning Man.

20:41.716 --> 20:43.419
Courtney:
I think India
is a beautiful girl,

20:43.419 --> 20:45.724
but if this is the life
that you want,

20:45.724 --> 20:48.062
you need to be okay
with your body.

20:48.062 --> 20:49.565
Yep.

20:49.565 --> 20:51.000
- What's next?
- India.

20:55.009 --> 20:58.583
Drew:
All right, let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go.

20:58.583 --> 20:59.919
Whoo!

20:59.919 --> 21:01.288
Mm-hmm.

21:01.288 --> 21:02.925
- Are you okay?
- Yep.

21:02.925 --> 21:04.595
Yes, yes, yes, I just
don't wanna think about it.

21:04.595 --> 21:06.198
Not think about it?
We're not thinking.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.568
♪ Doo, doo, doo ♪

21:07.568 --> 21:09.037
- Okay.
- Yep, happy, happy.

21:09.037 --> 21:11.576
I always told myself I
would never pose nude.

21:11.576 --> 21:13.680
- Come on, let's do it.
- Okay.

21:13.680 --> 21:16.685
I was like, "Oh my God.
Okay. Here we go."

21:18.054 --> 21:19.423
Ellen:
<i>Concentrate on hiding.</i>

21:19.423 --> 21:21.595
<i>Gorgeous.</i>

21:21.595 --> 21:23.900
I got out there and
I just completely forgot

21:23.900 --> 21:25.269
<i>that I had no
clothes on.</i>

21:25.269 --> 21:26.906
Look at each other.

21:26.906 --> 21:28.476
Marissa:
It just came
naturally, kind of.

21:28.476 --> 21:30.046
Which is a
little alarming.

21:30.046 --> 21:33.285
Go like, "Oh!
Oh my God, camera."

21:33.285 --> 21:36.224
This is the absolute
craziest thing I've ever done.

21:36.224 --> 21:38.128
<i>It's definitely freeing.
Very liberating.</i>

21:38.128 --> 21:41.335
India, can we try a couple
that your mom would get mad at?

21:41.335 --> 21:42.270
Ellen:
<i>That's nice.</i>

21:42.270 --> 21:44.040
<i>That's beautiful.</i>

21:44.040 --> 21:46.913
I was like covered in
pearls and covering everything.

21:46.913 --> 21:48.716
Ellen:
I think your mom
will love that.

21:48.716 --> 21:52.256
So technically,
I wasn't nude, Mom.

21:52.256 --> 21:53.793
Ellen:
<i>Beautiful, nice.</i>

21:53.793 --> 21:54.461
Drew:
<i>We have it.
She's good.</i>

21:54.461 --> 21:56.131
Amazing.

21:56.131 --> 21:57.935
( coughs )

21:57.935 --> 21:59.805
I'm sick,
but I feel confident

21:59.805 --> 22:01.576
and comfortable
with this shoot.

22:01.576 --> 22:06.785
<i>I feel like a 2016 punk
version of Marilyn Monroe.</i>

22:09.323 --> 22:10.627
- Yeah, yeah.
- Okay.

22:10.627 --> 22:12.664
It's just I'm
allergic to MAC.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.573
So if it had, like, all the oil
in it that would be bad.

22:16.573 --> 22:19.645
Tash:
I have never met one person
who knows how to play

22:19.645 --> 22:22.016
<i>that victim role
as well as Courtney.</i>

22:22.016 --> 22:23.285
( coughs )

22:23.285 --> 22:24.487
Girl, you got problems.

22:24.487 --> 22:25.524
Beautiful.

22:25.524 --> 22:26.993
Arch a little bit more.

22:26.993 --> 22:30.700
I have bars on my back,
so I'm-- it's okay.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.003
- Bars? Like big...
- Scoliosis.

22:32.003 --> 22:33.773
Scoliosis.

22:33.773 --> 22:36.177
Marissa:
Courtney is a little
immature sometimes,

22:36.177 --> 22:38.048
<i>but that face
is just so stunning.</i>

22:38.048 --> 22:39.685
I was, like,
watching her like,

22:39.685 --> 22:41.054
<i>"Damn, this girl
is the ( bleep )."</i>

22:41.054 --> 22:43.526
Give me some leg.
Some legs up.

22:45.863 --> 22:48.335
You've got to work together
to hide each other.

22:48.335 --> 22:50.674
Can't hide yourself.

22:50.674 --> 22:53.513
Tash, don't
cover too much.

22:53.513 --> 22:55.851
Tash didn't really know
what to do with her body.

22:55.851 --> 22:57.387
<i>She was kind of
flailing around.</i>

22:57.387 --> 22:59.959
Tash, we still can't
see anything.

22:59.959 --> 23:02.196
I don't think it
looked very good,

23:02.196 --> 23:04.500
Drew:
Now, Tash, they're kind of
like interlocked, join that.

23:04.500 --> 23:07.072
Courtney:
I feel like me and Giah
connected way better.

23:07.072 --> 23:10.245
You're crushing
Courtney a little.

23:10.245 --> 23:12.851
Dude, we don't have time
to playing games like this.

23:12.851 --> 23:17.727
Like, this is a group
shot. Fake it till you make it.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.364
- Helen: <i>Okay, thanks,
girls.</i> - Drew:Fab.

23:19.364 --> 23:23.138
- Whoo!
- All right, guys.
That's a wrap.

23:23.138 --> 23:24.140
( cheering )

23:24.140 --> 23:26.746
Done. Amazing!

23:26.746 --> 23:31.021
It takes balls to come to
someone's face and say that.

23:31.021 --> 23:31.989
That's some
hurtful ( bleep ).

23:31.989 --> 23:34.060
Your face looks
uncomfortable.

23:34.060 --> 23:38.034
I just am not confident
that you're a model.

23:52.296 --> 23:54.067
<i>I think everybody
just got naked today</i>

23:54.067 --> 23:55.236
<i>and we all
feel super close.</i>

23:55.236 --> 23:57.440
This was the most naked
day of all days.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.277
<i>Everyone's like,
"Wait, guys.</i>

23:59.277 --> 24:00.614
<i>How can we not
be friends?"</i>

24:00.614 --> 24:01.949
<i>Paige trying to figure
out this hair.</i>

24:01.949 --> 24:03.452
This-- I'm trying
to figure out--

24:03.452 --> 24:04.955
I've been trying to
figure this hair.

24:04.955 --> 24:06.424
<i>She's trying
to figure it out.</i>

24:06.424 --> 24:08.629
I've been trying to figure
out this hair for five hours.

24:08.629 --> 24:10.968
Marissa:
Me and Courtney got into
it a little bit yesterday,

24:10.968 --> 24:14.608
<i>but after the shoot I feel
a lot closer to every girl.</i>

24:14.608 --> 24:15.910
<i>I've just been thinking
about everything</i>

24:15.910 --> 24:17.213
that was
said last night.

24:17.213 --> 24:18.482
and that just made me
feel super bad.

24:18.482 --> 24:20.319
Yes, I do have
an attitude problem

24:20.319 --> 24:21.889
and yes,
you will get checked,

24:21.889 --> 24:24.460
but this is not
my opportunity

24:24.460 --> 24:26.231
to show who's
the biggest bitch.

24:26.231 --> 24:27.601
If I wanted
to be doing that,

24:27.601 --> 24:30.039
I would have applied
for "Bad Girls Club."

24:30.039 --> 24:31.876
I really feel guilty
that I feel like

24:31.876 --> 24:33.478
I'm contributing
to anyone badly.

24:33.478 --> 24:36.217
And knowing that you have
a really strong history

24:36.217 --> 24:38.989
that didn't break you,
just makes you a super
strong person.

24:38.989 --> 24:42.329
So for me saying
you're a crybaby
or you lack personality,

24:42.329 --> 24:44.000
that's some
hurtful ( bleep )

24:44.000 --> 24:45.236
because you've been
through a lot

24:45.236 --> 24:46.505
and you're not
broken from it.

24:46.505 --> 24:48.342
So, like, go you.

24:48.342 --> 24:52.183
It takes balls to come
to someone's face

24:52.183 --> 24:53.686
and say that
and apologize.

24:53.686 --> 24:56.157
I think Marissa
is very mature for her age.

24:56.157 --> 25:01.669
She did something at 18
that the twins can't even
do when they're almost 30.

25:01.669 --> 25:03.973
We have differences
and misunderstandings

25:03.973 --> 25:06.646
that totally could be worked
out with better communication.

25:06.646 --> 25:08.783
- Yeah, I know.
- That's the Marissa I know.

25:08.783 --> 25:11.021
You are a good person.

25:11.021 --> 25:12.356
Ritalert.

25:12.356 --> 25:13.793
Look at my--
Look at my little room.

25:13.793 --> 25:17.499
Shh.

25:17.499 --> 25:20.540
Hi ladies, I hope you're
owning the new looks we gave
you.

25:20.540 --> 25:22.878
<i>I can't wait
to see you rock it.</i>

25:22.878 --> 25:27.186
<i>Sadly, the time
has come where one of you
must go home.</i>

25:27.186 --> 25:29.992
Good luck.
See you soon, ladies.

25:29.992 --> 25:31.361
I told you.

25:31.361 --> 25:32.697
<i>Knew it was
elimination.</i>

25:36.639 --> 25:38.643
Cherish:
If I'm the one to go home,
I'll be very upset.

25:38.643 --> 25:40.178
I mean I like my hair now,

25:40.178 --> 25:43.218
and I think it really does
take me to the next level,

25:43.218 --> 25:45.557
<i>but I put a lot of trust
in the judges.</i>

25:45.557 --> 25:48.730
I'm going to be really honest,
I feel really good about
winning.

25:48.730 --> 25:50.634
I don't know if that's--

25:50.634 --> 25:53.706
I don't know if that's
just like ruins the moment
of unsureness,

25:53.706 --> 25:55.075
but I'm feeling pretty good.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.913
Courtney:
<i>I'm a little bit worried</i>

25:56.913 --> 25:59.484
<i>that I'm not going to deliver
what I wanted to deliver.</i>

25:59.484 --> 26:02.222
I think I'm just gonna
have to explain to the judges

26:02.222 --> 26:05.931
that I tried as hard as I
could with being as sick as I
was.

26:05.931 --> 26:09.069
I watched every single one of
you guys and you're all good.

26:09.069 --> 26:10.573
I'm very proud of myself
this week.

26:10.573 --> 26:13.378
I think I really pushed
myself to the next level,

26:13.378 --> 26:15.717
which is what the judges have
been waiting to see from me,

26:15.717 --> 26:17.755
<i>and I'm just gonna walk
in there, being confident.</i>

26:17.755 --> 26:20.059
You can just screw up
the one time and then
you're going home.

26:20.059 --> 26:22.096
I'm so
( bleep ) nervous.

26:22.096 --> 26:24.099
I'm a little concerned
about the group shot,

26:24.099 --> 26:25.837
<i>with Tash and
with Courtney,</i>

26:25.837 --> 26:29.611
<i>because I just feel like it
was a lot of pressure on me.</i>

26:29.611 --> 26:31.447
<i>So I'm just going to hope
for the best.</i>

26:31.447 --> 26:34.420
I'm going to pray
like I always do
and give it to God.

26:54.862 --> 26:57.099
- Hi, ladies.
- All: Hi.

26:57.099 --> 26:59.871
By the way, you all look
stunning.

26:59.871 --> 27:02.276
<i>I can't wait to see
your shots from this week.</i>

27:02.276 --> 27:04.447
Let's introduce
our new judges.

27:04.447 --> 27:08.589
Our gorgeous supermodel,
Ashley Graham.

27:08.589 --> 27:12.631
Our amazing image
architect to the stars, Law
Roach.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.802
And, our incredible
creative consultant

27:14.802 --> 27:18.142
and chief creative officer
at "Paper" magazine,
Drew Elliot.

27:18.142 --> 27:22.216
The winner of
"America's Next Top Model"
will receive $100,000

27:22.216 --> 27:25.790
<i>and be featured in
a commercial thanks
to Rimmel London.</i>

27:25.790 --> 27:27.460
The winner will
also be featured

27:27.460 --> 27:30.232
in a fashion spread
in "Paper" magazine.

27:30.232 --> 27:35.676
And get this, you'll get
an exclusive one year
talent deal with VH1.

27:35.676 --> 27:39.150
This week we gave each
of you a trademark style

27:39.150 --> 27:40.987
<i>to help establish
your brand.</i>

27:40.987 --> 27:44.594
Then, we threw you straight
into a nude group photo shoot.

27:44.594 --> 27:49.971
By the way, you weren't
the only girls to pose nude.

27:49.971 --> 27:51.675
( laughs )

27:51.675 --> 27:55.449
I mean, how did it feel
to pose with Ashley herself?

27:55.449 --> 27:56.585
She's so sexy.

27:56.585 --> 27:58.488
Rita: <i>Right?</i>

27:58.488 --> 28:01.428
I just felt like
if I'm the one talking
about body confidence

28:01.428 --> 28:03.833
and I'm over here posing
naked on my own time,

28:03.833 --> 28:05.503
why not do it with y'all?

28:05.503 --> 28:07.373
And I mean it's going to be
a tough decision,

28:07.373 --> 28:10.513
because, you know,
Ellen makes everyone
look incredible.

28:10.513 --> 28:12.718
So, you were put together
in groups.

28:12.718 --> 28:15.857
<i>So let's start
with our first squad.</i>

28:15.857 --> 28:17.561
( all reacting excitedly )

28:17.561 --> 28:19.899
This is so amazing!

28:19.899 --> 28:21.467
Wow.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.038
- Ashley: <i>Incredible.</i>
- Law:Yes.

28:23.038 --> 28:24.207
Okay, so, let's start off
with Cody.

28:24.207 --> 28:27.346
Will you please
step forward?

28:27.346 --> 28:29.317
Let's take a look
at your single shot.

28:29.317 --> 28:30.620
Ashley:
<i>You look amazing, Cody.</i>

28:30.620 --> 28:32.456
Cody, how do you feel?

28:32.456 --> 28:34.661
It is a huge change.
I like being a tomboy

28:34.661 --> 28:37.199
and I was like, "Wait,
are they not gonna allow me

28:37.199 --> 28:38.736
<i>to express
that part of myself?"</i>

28:38.736 --> 28:40.472
Let me just get
one thing clear.

28:40.472 --> 28:45.717
We do what we think is best
to elevate you and your brand.

28:45.717 --> 28:47.887
And I thought it was
really interesting too, you
said,

28:47.887 --> 28:51.528
"You know what? I can rock long
hair better than my sister."

28:51.528 --> 28:53.498
- I can.
- You, like, gave it to me.

28:53.498 --> 28:56.539
Wild style didn't
work with Ellen.
She's tough

28:56.539 --> 28:58.408
because she knows exactly
what she wants

28:58.408 --> 28:59.844
and she's not afraid
to tell you that.

28:59.844 --> 29:02.382
This is beyond.

29:02.382 --> 29:05.389
Coryanne, can you please
step forward?

29:05.389 --> 29:07.225
Let's have a look
at your photo.

29:07.225 --> 29:09.931
If you're like, selling
underwear

29:09.931 --> 29:12.370
I would so walk into
Victoria's Secret

29:12.370 --> 29:13.673
<i>just to kind of
look at the photo bra.</i>

29:13.673 --> 29:17.246
Coryanne, mother,
that face is beautiful.

29:17.246 --> 29:19.116
<i>My favorite
picture so far.</i>

29:19.116 --> 29:23.058
You were much, much better
at this shoot than
I've seen you be.

29:23.058 --> 29:25.262
<i>The hair really
gave you the power.</i>

29:25.262 --> 29:27.868
Rita:
This is one of the best
makeovers I've seen.

29:27.868 --> 29:30.740
<i>We didn't exactly
take away from your look,
we just added it more</i>

29:30.740 --> 29:32.543
<i>and we gave you
a little bit more color.</i>

29:32.543 --> 29:34.046
It's great,
I remember you now.

29:34.046 --> 29:35.416
Oh, wow.

29:35.416 --> 29:37.019
Kyle, can you step forward,
please?

29:37.019 --> 29:39.257
<i>That 'do is
giving me life!</i>

29:39.257 --> 29:40.926
I'm loving it.
How do you feel?

29:40.926 --> 29:42.362
Really good.
I like it a lot.

29:42.362 --> 29:44.100
Let's take a look
at your individual.

29:44.100 --> 29:47.273
Ashley:
You know your angles and you
know how to work your body.

29:47.273 --> 29:48.543
Rita:
<i>It's so masculine.</i>

29:48.543 --> 29:50.445
<i>I love
the form of your eyes.</i>

29:50.445 --> 29:52.617
Law:
I think she looks actually
really soft in the picture.

29:52.617 --> 29:54.888
Really feminine and I'm
very surprised, but I love it.

29:54.888 --> 29:56.291
Kyle, thank you so much.

29:56.291 --> 29:58.328
Tatiana, could you please
step forward?

29:58.328 --> 30:01.735
Let's take a look
at your single shot.

30:01.735 --> 30:04.073
Law:
Your style, your aesthetic,
it's always right.

30:04.073 --> 30:05.576
I can't really say
anything bad.

30:05.576 --> 30:07.814
I think you are
supermodel material.

30:07.814 --> 30:09.951
<i>I think that your
body is on point.</i>

30:09.951 --> 30:12.658
I love you
and I love this shot.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.127
All right, squad 2.

30:14.127 --> 30:16.732
Let's take a look
at your group shot.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.638
- Ashley: <i>Oh, I love it
so much!</i>
- Rita:I'm so happy.

30:19.638 --> 30:20.573
<i>It's just sexy.</i>

30:20.573 --> 30:22.910
I wanna be part
of that fun group.

30:22.910 --> 30:24.113
Marissa, let's
start with you.

30:25.649 --> 30:29.256
Ashley:
The body, the attitude,
the personality.

30:29.256 --> 30:31.829
You rocked it, so whatever
you're doing, keep doing it.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.331
Thank you so much.

30:33.331 --> 30:36.338
Paige. Let's take a look
at your individual.

30:36.338 --> 30:39.811
<i>You look so beautiful.</i>

30:39.811 --> 30:41.815
<i>And your booty looks hot.</i>

30:41.815 --> 30:46.324
You've kept it feminine but
you've also kept it classy.

30:46.324 --> 30:47.994
<i>And your hair is giving me
rock and roll.</i>

30:47.994 --> 30:49.464
It's just like,
"What's up?"

30:49.464 --> 30:51.133
This is
your trademark look.

30:51.133 --> 30:52.670
If you hair starts growing out,
cut it, honey.

30:54.173 --> 30:56.010
- Rita: <i>India.</i>
- Hello.

30:57.948 --> 31:01.020
- I mean, yes, yes, yes.
- Whoo hoo!

31:01.020 --> 31:02.824
You know how the photos
are black and white?

31:02.824 --> 31:06.130
Ellen, she said, "I can't not
put her purple hair in this."

31:06.130 --> 31:08.536
Law:
<i>I love the photo.</i>

31:08.536 --> 31:11.006
<i>I love the face.
You have range.</i>

31:11.006 --> 31:12.375
You are India.

31:12.375 --> 31:15.182
I felt super great
after the shoot.

31:15.182 --> 31:16.985
Drew:
It was just
a big day for you.

31:16.985 --> 31:18.989
You had your hair
dyed purple

31:18.989 --> 31:20.526
<i>and you did
a nude photo shoot</i>

31:20.526 --> 31:23.364
which you were extremely
uncomfortable with.

31:23.364 --> 31:25.703
Everybody has limits, you
know. Just give yourself a limit

31:25.703 --> 31:27.406
and say "I'm gonna do this
but this is why I'm not doing."

31:27.406 --> 31:29.210
And don't move past it.
When I showed up

31:29.210 --> 31:31.715
with Terry Richardson
for the cover of "Look" magazine

31:31.715 --> 31:34.053
I said, "You know what,
I'll give you this, but
I'm not giving you this."

31:34.053 --> 31:35.990
<i>No more conversation.</i>

31:35.990 --> 31:37.426
<i>And that's what you did,
so I'm very proud of you.</i>

31:37.426 --> 31:40.065
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

31:40.065 --> 31:42.435
Squad three.

31:42.435 --> 31:44.007
<i>As a collective, it
looked like you're supporting
each other,</i>

31:44.007 --> 31:45.643
<i>which is amazing.</i>

31:45.643 --> 31:49.049
Girls supporting girls.
I'm such a big fan of that.

31:49.049 --> 31:49.884
<i>Okay, so let's start
off with Binta.</i>

31:51.855 --> 31:54.894
Ashley:
<i>I don't love it.</i>

31:54.894 --> 31:58.435
I don't. I'm so sorry, Binta.
I really wanted to love it.

31:58.435 --> 32:01.407
I think you're hiding
yourself a little bit

32:01.407 --> 32:03.512
<i>because you're thinking too
much of the other women.</i>

32:03.512 --> 32:05.583
I wish your head
would have been up,

32:05.583 --> 32:07.353
<i>I wish we could've seen
your neck.</i>

32:07.353 --> 32:09.290
<i>I think your ass
looks amazing.</i>

32:09.290 --> 32:11.595
Rita:
<i>In a group photo...</i>

32:11.595 --> 32:15.436
if you are not giving face
in every single shot

32:15.436 --> 32:18.509
<i>and someone else is, you just
become the girl in the photo</i>

32:18.509 --> 32:20.713
that isn't giving
the best look.

32:20.713 --> 32:22.584
Thank you, Binta.

32:22.584 --> 32:24.119
Krislian, can you
step forward, please?

32:25.455 --> 32:27.627
Let's take a look
at your shot.

32:27.627 --> 32:30.265
<i>I mean, definitely sexy.</i>

32:30.265 --> 32:33.238
The only thing that I see
is sexy, though.

32:33.238 --> 32:35.242
So my fear
is that we can't go

32:35.242 --> 32:37.079
into the other
realm of editorial.

32:37.079 --> 32:40.285
Rita:
I think what my thing is
with you, Krislian, is...

32:40.285 --> 32:43.291
I'm trying to take you
away from online.

32:43.291 --> 32:45.295
You look like
an online model.

32:45.295 --> 32:47.099
There's a little bit
more work to do

32:47.099 --> 32:48.769
in the body posturing.

32:48.769 --> 32:51.273
We need some sophistication
and that's it.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.610
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Thank you so much.

32:52.610 --> 32:54.213
Cherish.

32:54.213 --> 32:56.618
<i>Let's take a look
at your photo.</i>

32:56.618 --> 33:00.560
<i>This photo for me did
you no justice whatsoever.</i>

33:00.560 --> 33:02.630
<i>Your face
looks uncomfortable.</i>

33:02.630 --> 33:05.468
<i>Your hand
looks very awkward.</i>

33:05.468 --> 33:07.106
It's weird, it almost
looks like...

33:07.106 --> 33:08.308
...a claw.

33:08.308 --> 33:09.811
<i>When I watched
you on set,</i>

33:09.811 --> 33:13.351
I just-- I'm not confident
that you're a model.

33:13.351 --> 33:16.257
I know I'm a way stronger
model than this

33:16.257 --> 33:19.263
and I really wanna prove
it to you guys.

33:19.263 --> 33:21.300
We're gonna have
to just wait and see.

33:21.300 --> 33:25.008
So group four,
let's take a look.

33:25.008 --> 33:27.012
<i>Badass!</i>

33:27.012 --> 33:28.983
<i>I just found
my gangster squad.</i>

33:28.983 --> 33:31.488
That is like, boom!

33:31.488 --> 33:33.926
<i>Tash,
let's start off with you.</i>

33:33.926 --> 33:35.428
<i>You look great.</i>

33:35.428 --> 33:38.501
You've just gone from here
to here in my opinion.

33:38.501 --> 33:40.305
Ashley:
<i>That photo is amazing.</i>

33:40.305 --> 33:42.877
<i>Just having that
one leg forward</i>

33:42.877 --> 33:46.618
<i>brings you in to the photo
and you look badass.</i>

33:46.618 --> 33:48.956
And I would've thought
that you've had that look
for a very long time.

33:48.956 --> 33:51.528
- I am a badass.
- Law: <i>This is one of</i>
my favorite makeovers.

33:51.528 --> 33:53.999
Look at the face.
It's so tough and
it's so androgynous

33:53.999 --> 33:55.536
but it's sexy
at the same time.

33:55.536 --> 33:58.341
You have become
the dark horse for me

33:58.341 --> 34:01.447
and I am really excited
to see what happens, thank you.

34:01.447 --> 34:03.819
- Rita: <i>Thanks, Tash.</i>
- Ashley:Ooh.

34:03.819 --> 34:07.459
- See, look at that.
- She practiced that. I like it.

34:07.459 --> 34:09.731
Up next.
Giah.

34:09.731 --> 34:11.635
<i>Let's take a look
at your shot.</i>

34:11.635 --> 34:15.910
Law:
This looks like, model,
model, R&B singer.

34:15.910 --> 34:17.680
<i>You just don't look like
a model to me right here.</i>

34:17.680 --> 34:20.252
You don't look like a model
to me right now in front of me.

34:20.252 --> 34:23.024
- Only one, Law.
- I just have to be honest.

34:23.024 --> 34:24.561
I know, girl, trust me.

34:24.561 --> 34:26.497
If I don't tell the truth,
my heart is gonna bust.

34:26.497 --> 34:28.234
Listen, that's
why you're here.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.472
Your trademark style
looks amazing.

34:30.472 --> 34:33.545
<i>I think there's been a true
transformation in you.</i>

34:33.545 --> 34:36.518
<i>I would say from
the model perspective</i>

34:36.518 --> 34:38.221
I think the next shoot
is going to have to be

34:38.221 --> 34:40.224
really, really strong

34:40.224 --> 34:42.864
if you move
to next week.

34:42.864 --> 34:45.501
Yeah. I'm definitely
gonna bring it.

34:45.501 --> 34:47.005
Okay, thank you.

34:47.005 --> 34:49.577
Last up. Courtney.

34:49.577 --> 34:51.682
<i>Wow, Courtney,
it's just timeless for me.</i>

34:51.682 --> 34:53.552
- <i>Timeless, timeless.</i>
- Yum, yum, yummy.

34:53.552 --> 34:56.090
Rita:
Your hair just gives
you, just, elegance.

34:56.090 --> 34:59.129
<i>You have such
an incredible face.</i>

34:59.129 --> 35:01.768
I wanna be your friend.
I wanna have sex with you

35:01.768 --> 35:02.971
<i>and I wanna be you.</i>

35:02.971 --> 35:04.273
<i>Does that make sense?</i>

35:04.273 --> 35:08.515
For me, so far,
you deliver on every front.

35:08.515 --> 35:11.588
When Ellen told you
to arch your back,
it wasn't a complaint,

35:11.588 --> 35:13.926
it was that you tried to do
as much as you could

35:13.926 --> 35:16.297
and you did
a phenomenal job.

35:16.297 --> 35:18.268
Thank you.

35:18.268 --> 35:19.904
And now it's time
for us to decide

35:19.904 --> 35:22.943
which one of you is gonna pack
your bags and leave tonight.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.769
All right, guys.

35:35.769 --> 35:37.439
Unfortunately,
someone has to go.

35:37.439 --> 35:39.911
So let's talk about
our favorite this week.

35:39.911 --> 35:41.080
<i>Let's start off
with Coryanne.</i>

35:41.080 --> 35:44.621
She elevated her posing,
she elevated her face

35:44.621 --> 35:46.991
She just stepped up it
a whole notch since last week.

35:46.991 --> 35:49.463
She was in the bottom two
and now, I'm like "Oomph."

35:49.463 --> 35:51.401
Can't stop looking at her.

35:51.401 --> 35:52.670
- <i>Courtney.</i>
- Law:She looks like a girl

35:52.670 --> 35:55.174
that walks
the runways in Paris.

35:55.174 --> 35:57.279
She's definitely my favorite
photo of the night.

35:57.279 --> 35:58.682
The only thing
I don't like about her

35:58.682 --> 36:00.351
is I don't believe
everything else.

36:00.351 --> 36:02.122
I don't believe
the brand and the boss.

36:02.122 --> 36:03.325
I don't.

36:03.325 --> 36:04.460
Rita:
<i>India.</i>

36:04.460 --> 36:06.264
I don't remember her
photo from last week.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.701
But this one,
I'm gonna remember.

36:07.701 --> 36:10.640
I'm down with this color.
Kids can copy her.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.510
Binta:
<i>Don't cry.
Your look is your look.</i>

36:12.510 --> 36:14.346
I'm positive they liked
this one better than last time.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.616
Okay, so, that's
all that matters.

36:15.616 --> 36:17.687
Cherish:This was
a big change for me.

36:17.687 --> 36:20.425
I'm not gonna cry anymore
because I know
I'm a great model

36:20.425 --> 36:23.699
and I know I killed
that shoot with Ellen.

36:23.699 --> 36:26.204
You can't look like
an R&B singer next time.

36:26.204 --> 36:28.374
That doesn't mean
you're going home.

36:28.374 --> 36:31.882
Rita:Let's talk about the girls
that didn't do so well this
week.

36:31.882 --> 36:33.484
<i>Cherish.</i>

36:33.484 --> 36:35.388
Ashley:
You know what,
I feel kinda bad

36:35.388 --> 36:36.390
<i>because, like,
she cried so much</i>

36:36.390 --> 36:38.696
during her transformation.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.231
By the way, she didn't have
a major transformation.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.869
She went from red to red.

36:41.869 --> 36:44.173
She was better today.
She was more sophisticated.

36:44.173 --> 36:45.208
But she still
didn't bring it.

36:45.208 --> 36:46.778
Rita:
<i>Krislian.</i>

36:46.778 --> 36:50.285
I don't know if we could
possibly transform this girl.

36:50.285 --> 36:51.955
I did see
drastic improvement.

36:51.955 --> 36:53.457
She's a pretty girl.
She can take a pretty picture.

36:53.457 --> 36:54.995
She's not a model.

36:54.995 --> 36:56.899
- Rita: <i>Giah.</i>
- Ashley:I love Giah.

36:56.899 --> 36:58.167
But I still think there's
something that she's not giving

36:58.167 --> 36:59.804
that's that "unh!"

36:59.804 --> 37:02.042
Okay, guys, you feel like
we've made a decision?

37:02.042 --> 37:04.246
- Yes.
- Are we ready
to let them know?

37:04.246 --> 37:05.315
Yeah.

37:05.315 --> 37:06.584
( sighs )

37:08.387 --> 37:09.925
Rita:
<i>Models, welcome back.</i>

37:09.925 --> 37:12.696
If I call your name,
you will be staying another week

37:12.696 --> 37:15.268
<i>to prove you have
what it takes to become</i>

37:15.268 --> 37:16.871
<i>America's Next Top Model.</i>

37:19.377 --> 37:22.315
The first name I call
gets best photo.

37:25.890 --> 37:26.925
Courtney.

37:30.098 --> 37:31.434
Come here.

37:31.434 --> 37:34.339
- Congratulations.
- Wow. Thank you.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.275
<i>You did
an extraordinary job.</i>

37:35.275 --> 37:37.613
You really owned
your new makeover.

37:37.613 --> 37:42.624
- You should be really proud
of that, congratulations.
- <i>I am. Thank you so much.</i>

37:42.624 --> 37:46.965
The next name
I'm gonna call is...

37:46.965 --> 37:47.933
Coryanne.

37:50.706 --> 37:51.741
Marissa.

37:53.879 --> 37:56.685
<i>India.</i>

37:56.685 --> 38:00.792
Ladies, you're the top four.
You should be really proud
of yourselves.

38:00.792 --> 38:02.764
The next name,

38:02.764 --> 38:03.932
Cody.

38:05.803 --> 38:06.738
Tash.

38:10.278 --> 38:11.079
<i>Kyle.</i>

38:13.317 --> 38:14.587
<i>Tatiana.</i>

38:19.997 --> 38:22.403
Four names left.

38:22.403 --> 38:24.239
<i>This was very
difficult for us.</i>

38:28.314 --> 38:30.418
Paige.

38:34.126 --> 38:35.494
<i>Binta.</i>

38:40.005 --> 38:41.006
<i>Giah.</i>

38:44.246 --> 38:46.985
Krislian and Cherish,
can you please step forward?

38:46.985 --> 38:47.953
Come here, sugar.

38:52.429 --> 38:55.468
Cherish, we tried
to give you vibrance,

38:55.468 --> 38:59.844
but in that
photo you faded away.

38:59.844 --> 39:03.852
Do you really have what
it takes to be a boss?

39:03.852 --> 39:05.321
Absolutely.

39:07.359 --> 39:12.536
Krislian, without a doubt
your new style has elevated
your look,

39:12.536 --> 39:15.275
but your photo
still says "commercial."

39:15.275 --> 39:19.282
Can you go from catalog
to catwalk?

39:19.282 --> 39:20.986
<i>The judges
just don't know.</i>

39:23.224 --> 39:25.294
So who's it gonna be?

39:27.700 --> 39:29.738
The girl who
is one step closer

39:29.738 --> 39:33.277
to becoming
America's Next Top Model
is...

39:35.281 --> 39:36.618
<i>Krislian.</i>

39:39.223 --> 39:42.295
Krislian, you
have to think

39:42.295 --> 39:45.402
and believe
you're a supermodel.

39:45.402 --> 39:50.411
Not an Instagram model,
not a video model. Okay?

39:50.411 --> 39:53.652
Go over there.
It's okay.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.823
- Ta-da.
- Cherish, at the end
of the day,

39:55.823 --> 39:58.160
<i>your picture really didn't
prove as well as the others.</i>

39:58.160 --> 40:00.431
It's upsetting,
'cause the other girls look
good in the photo,

40:00.431 --> 40:01.501
<i>but I know I didn't.</i>

40:01.501 --> 40:02.770
Fantastic an issue.

40:02.770 --> 40:04.473
You can go say goodbye
to your friends.

40:04.473 --> 40:08.582
Playas!
Come here. Ah!

40:08.582 --> 40:10.418
You're trying to break me,
but you can't,

40:10.418 --> 40:12.656
so... yeah,
I'm angry.

40:12.656 --> 40:15.696
The fact that they told me
to dye my hair and you know,

40:15.696 --> 40:18.535
dye my integrity of
who I am as a person inside,

40:18.535 --> 40:20.506
by being
a "genuine redhead."

40:20.506 --> 40:23.177
<i>It's like, I did it,
'cause I trusted them.</i>

40:23.177 --> 40:24.780
I don't trust nobody.

40:24.780 --> 40:27.720
<i>I did ( bleep )
amazing in that photo shoot</i>

40:27.720 --> 40:31.360
and I don't understand why
they don't see anything in me,

40:31.360 --> 40:33.364
'cause I am everything.

40:33.364 --> 40:35.803
<i>"America's Next Top Model"
isn't the end for me,</i>

40:35.803 --> 40:38.709
<i>and I'm a strong woman
and you can't break me.</i>

40:38.709 --> 40:42.950
So have fun picking your winner,
because I'm a unicorn.

40:59.818 --> 41:02.757
Today is all
about social media.

41:02.757 --> 41:05.929
I want you
to meet DJ Khaled.

41:09.570 --> 41:11.775
- Arguing with me
is not going this...
- Next text!

41:11.775 --> 41:13.712
You take the phone.

41:13.712 --> 41:16.751
- I was doing
everything for you.
- I tried to get you--

41:16.751 --> 41:18.889
Nothing, you
stupid-ass bitch.

41:18.889 --> 41:22.095
On the first day
I saw Courtney, I saw like
a little evil in her.

41:22.095 --> 41:23.799
It is ( bleep ) broken,

41:23.799 --> 41:25.969
I'm like, out of
the competition.

41:25.969 --> 41:27.472
Karma is a bitch.

41:33.585 --> 41:35.087
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
