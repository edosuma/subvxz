11:50.881 --> 11:53.593
What's everyone
so happy about?

11:53.593 --> 11:55.796
Is it macaroni
and beef day?

11:55.796 --> 11:57.177
Hey, Chyna!
It's me Paisley!

11:57.177 --> 11:59.760
Paisley Houndstooth!

11:59.760 --> 12:02.012
We went to school together
before you were famous.

12:04.014 --> 12:04.474
Paisley, that
was yesterday.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.398
It does feel
like yesterday.

12:09.269 --> 12:10.440
She remembers me!

12:16.987 --> 12:19.409
Hey, what are
you guys doing?

12:19.409 --> 12:21.121
You don't have to let me go
to the front of the line.

12:21.121 --> 12:22.993
I'm still the
same Chyna.
 Shh.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.535
It is macaroni and beef day
and there's never enough
to go around.

12:25.535 --> 12:28.668
Watch out! Famous
celebrity and her entourage
coming through!

12:30.630 --> 12:32.422
Guys, relax.

12:32.422 --> 12:35.135
Last night was really cool,
but it was just
a one time thing.

12:35.135 --> 12:35.505
I do not need
special treatment.

12:41.341 --> 12:43.183
Although
decent treatment
would be nice.

12:47.767 --> 12:48.688
Psst. Chyna?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.854
Syerra? Laurin?

12:53.854 --> 12:55.155
What are you guys
doing here?

12:55.155 --> 12:57.607
And why are you
dressed like that?

12:57.607 --> 13:00.200
This is what we wear
when we're out in public,
so we don't get mobbed.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.743
Look who's here!

13:03.743 --> 13:07.247
Two nobodies trying
to horn in on our
macaroni and beef!

13:07.998 --> 13:08.829
Let's get 'em!

13:11.501 --> 13:13.914
Relax!
They don't even like
macaroni and beef.

13:15.625 --> 13:17.878
They don't like
macaroni and beef?

13:17.878 --> 13:20.590
Let's get 'em!
 ALL: Yeah!

13:20.590 --> 13:24.885
I mean, they had
macaroni and beef
before they came.

13:24.885 --> 13:27.557
They have their own stash
of macaroni and beef?

13:27.557 --> 13:30.480
Let's get 'em!
 ALL: Yeah!

13:30.480 --> 13:32.432
Did I say
macaroni and beef?

13:32.432 --> 13:35.315
I meant
beef and macaroni.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.316
ALL: Oh!

13:40.861 --> 13:46.366
Anyway, it turns out Darlene
had a lot of time to think
while she was on the toilet.

13:46.366 --> 13:48.999
And she decided
to quit Trifecta.
For good.

13:48.999 --> 13:51.121
What?

13:51.121 --> 13:53.253
Trifecta can't break up!

13:53.253 --> 13:56.086
Track five on
your third album is
 Together Forever.

13:57.457 --> 13:58.959
We're not breaking up.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.670
We're just getting
a new member.

14:00.670 --> 14:03.013
You.
 What?

14:03.013 --> 14:06.266
You were so good last night
no one even missed Darlene.

14:06.266 --> 14:09.559
So we want you to
leave school and
go on tour with us!

14:09.559 --> 14:12.022
You want Chyna
to leave school?

14:12.022 --> 14:13.143
And go on tour
with them.

14:14.104 --> 14:16.776
Yes! I'm in Trifecta!

14:16.776 --> 14:18.738
I'm in Trifecta!

14:18.738 --> 14:19.739
Did you guys hear that?
I'm in Trifecta!

14:32.042 --> 14:32.832
(TV PLAYING)

14:32.832 --> 14:33.954
Hey! There's my megastar!

14:33.954 --> 14:36.666
Thanks, Dad.

14:36.666 --> 14:39.049
No, I meant my Megastar
universal remote I bought.

14:39.049 --> 14:41.131
It controls the TV
and the DVR!

14:41.131 --> 14:42.963
Mmm!

14:42.963 --> 14:45.095
But you were incredible!

14:45.095 --> 14:46.716
I'm so proud of you!

14:48.598 --> 14:49.219
I brought you
something from school.

14:51.271 --> 14:52.772
Is this

14:52.772 --> 14:54.354
macaroni and beef?

14:56.276 --> 14:57.357
What do you want?

14:59.519 --> 15:01.071
Nothing.

15:01.071 --> 15:04.194
I was just
wondering if

15:04.194 --> 15:06.616
I could go
on a little trip with
a couple of friends.

15:06.616 --> 15:08.908
Well, where would you
guys be going?

15:09.789 --> 15:12.662
These places.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.375
Trifecta asked me
to join the band and
go on tour with them.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.247
What?

15:17.247 --> 15:19.459
I thought this was
a one time thing.

15:19.459 --> 15:22.422
Well, it was
supposed to be,
but Darlene quit.

15:22.422 --> 15:24.754
Now they want
to make me
a permanent member.

15:24.754 --> 15:25.845
Isn't that exciting?

15:26.756 --> 15:28.598
And only exciting,

15:28.598 --> 15:30.850
and not at all a problem
in any kind of way?

15:32.722 --> 15:34.014
Well, aren't you
going to say something?

15:35.605 --> 15:37.267
Come on, say something.
Anything.

15:39.649 --> 15:42.062
Okay. No, you can't go.

15:42.062 --> 15:43.943
Absolutely not.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.066
Okay, um, come to think of it,
don't say anything.

15:46.066 --> 15:47.277
Just take your time.

15:48.828 --> 15:50.700
Mull it over,

15:50.700 --> 15:52.912
perhaps while eating some
delicious macaroni and beef,

15:52.912 --> 15:55.996
which, uh, keep in mind,
I brought you so you kind of

15:55.996 --> 15:58.078
owe me one now.

15:59.079 --> 16:02.132
Chyna, you're 13 years old.

16:02.132 --> 16:05.385
I know, but, I'll be
completely supervised,

16:05.385 --> 16:08.348
I'll have a full-time tutor,
and I'll be a Trifecta!

16:10.050 --> 16:13.893
But all the places
on this shirt
are far away.

16:13.893 --> 16:15.265
Can't you guys just
tour the neighborhood?

16:18.098 --> 16:22.152
I know it's a big step, Dad,
but this is everything
I've ever wanted.

16:22.152 --> 16:23.863
You always say
we should
follow our dreams.

16:23.863 --> 16:26.406
Yeah, but I meant
the kind of dreams
I have.

16:26.406 --> 16:28.158
Like last night

16:28.158 --> 16:30.370
I had a dream that
I put bacon on my cereal.

16:30.370 --> 16:31.821
And then this morning,

16:31.821 --> 16:35.035
I lived my dream.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.327
Not the type of dreams
that would take my
little girl far away from me.

16:39.119 --> 16:42.542
I'd really
miss you too, Dad,

16:42.542 --> 16:43.293
but this is the
chance of a lifetime.

16:45.335 --> 16:47.387
Please.

16:47.387 --> 16:50.930
Well, I'll have to
ask your mom, but...

16:50.930 --> 16:52.972
Thank you, thank you,
thank you!

16:52.972 --> 16:54.304
Hey! I did not
say yes yet.

16:56.266 --> 16:58.558
But if this is
what you want,
I'll support you.

16:58.558 --> 17:01.811
I love you so much!
 (LAUGHS)

17:01.811 --> 17:03.853
I love you, too.

17:03.853 --> 17:05.855
That's why
I'm not letting go of you
until you get on that bus.

17:05.855 --> 17:08.358
(LAUGHS)

17:13.823 --> 17:15.454
ALL: Surprise!

17:16.116 --> 17:17.997
(LAUGHS)

17:18.828 --> 17:20.920
That's so sweet!

17:20.920 --> 17:23.252
I can't believe
you guys threw
a farewell party for me!

17:23.252 --> 17:26.215
Oh, we didn't.
 She did.

17:26.215 --> 17:27.757
I've been planning it
since the day

17:27.757 --> 17:29.759
you showed up
at this school.

17:29.759 --> 17:32.592
Finally a chance to
use these "Good riddance
Chyna" balloons!

17:34.634 --> 17:38.057
Oh, Lexi. I'm going to
miss you least of all.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.849
You're going to miss me?

17:47.817 --> 17:50.110
Chyna, I know it's silly,

17:50.110 --> 17:53.533
but now that
you're famous and all,

17:53.533 --> 17:55.365
can I get your autograph
before you leave?

17:55.365 --> 17:57.617
Really?
 Yeah.

17:57.617 --> 17:58.578
Okay.

17:59.999 --> 18:02.962
Ha!

18:02.962 --> 18:05.335
You just signed
an iron-clad,
binding contract

18:05.335 --> 18:07.046
that says you will
never leave Webster High!

18:07.046 --> 18:09.879
Plus we're now legally
married in the Bahamas.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.514
Fletcher, this is
a geography test
you got a D on.

18:16.926 --> 18:18.978
My mom was supposed
to sign that one.

18:18.978 --> 18:21.721
(CHUCKLES)

18:21.721 --> 18:24.144
I can't believe
I'm not gonna see you guys
for almost a year.

18:26.486 --> 18:28.568
Punch me in the face.
 What?

18:28.568 --> 18:31.281
Punch me in the face!
 Why would I punch you
in the face?

18:31.281 --> 18:34.364
Because I'm not gonna
miss some jerk who
punches me in the face!

18:34.364 --> 18:35.735
Olive, I'm not going to
punch you in the face.

18:36.576 --> 18:38.448
Of course not!

18:38.448 --> 18:40.200
You would never
do that to me.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.871
That's why I'm going
to miss you so much!

18:41.871 --> 18:43.543
I'll punch you in the face.
 Stay out of this, Fletcher!

18:48.168 --> 18:49.419
Maybe I could
come with you.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.462
Do you guys need
any backup dancers?

18:55.715 --> 18:59.639
Look, I'm really going
to miss you guys, too.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.351
But we'll video chat
every day.

19:01.351 --> 19:02.892
We have our A.N.T. Pads!

19:02.892 --> 19:05.024
Actually,
that's school property.

19:05.024 --> 19:06.316
And as school
supply monitor,

19:06.316 --> 19:07.527
I'm gonna need
to confiscate that.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.732
Ah. Here, take it.

19:12.732 --> 19:14.614
I won't tell.
 (CHYNA CHUCKLES)

19:14.614 --> 19:17.697
Come on, guys,
it's time for cake!

19:17.697 --> 19:20.119
"I thought
you'd never leave."

19:21.241 --> 19:23.543
Aw. How sweet.

19:23.543 --> 19:24.454
It's made with coconut.

19:24.454 --> 19:27.166
You hate coconut, right?

19:30.460 --> 19:32.962
SYERRA: Welcome to your home
for the next year!

19:32.962 --> 19:35.795
Come on. We will
show you around while
Gus gets your bags.

19:35.795 --> 19:38.258
He's our new bus driver.

19:38.258 --> 19:40.850
I can't believe
our last bus driver quit.

19:40.850 --> 19:43.263
We wrote
 "Together Forever"
 about him.

19:43.263 --> 19:45.725
Don't worry about me
texting and driving,

19:45.725 --> 19:48.568
because I do not know
what texting is.

19:51.070 --> 19:55.365
So, Chyna,
what do you think?

19:55.365 --> 19:58.197
This place is awesome!

19:58.197 --> 20:01.741
Video games,
a recording studio...

20:01.741 --> 20:02.952
Ooh, what's in here?

20:02.952 --> 20:04.123
That's the bathroom.

20:04.123 --> 20:05.785
But, I wouldn't
go in there.

20:05.785 --> 20:07.667
It's still recovering
from Darlene.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.379
But don't worry.

20:09.379 --> 20:10.540
We've got this
scented candle.

20:13.883 --> 20:16.095
So, there's a living room,
a kitchen,
and three bedrooms.

20:16.095 --> 20:18.217
(CHUCKLES)

20:18.217 --> 20:20.009
Ooh!

20:20.009 --> 20:21.220
Can I please
have the top bunk?

20:21.220 --> 20:24.264
BOTH: Yes!

20:24.264 --> 20:25.224
Am I going to fall out
every time the bus turns?

20:25.224 --> 20:28.107
BOTH: Yes!

20:28.107 --> 20:29.309

20:33.773 --> 20:35.565
This happens
all the time.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.737
Crazed fans trying
to sneak on the bus.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.989
That's why we both
study ju-jitsu!

20:39.989 --> 20:41.781
BOTH: Hi-yah!

20:41.781 --> 20:43.363
No. No, no, no, no.

(GRUNTING)

20:45.785 --> 20:49.208

20:49.208 --> 20:51.921
Wow. That ju-jitsu
really works.

20:51.921 --> 20:53.543
And we've only
had one lesson.

20:53.543 --> 20:54.674
How to yell "hi-yah"
and pose like this...

21:06.015 --> 21:09.349
Why are you
gift wrapping
the hallways?

21:09.349 --> 21:10.810
They're posters
for the school play.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.692
We already had
the school play.

21:12.692 --> 21:15.695
Chyna was the lead and
you were the lead usher.

21:15.695 --> 21:20.239
I remember your big line.
"Who cares?
Just sit anywhere!"

21:22.572 --> 21:24.364
I don't care
if we already
did a school play!

21:24.364 --> 21:26.326
We're doing another one!

21:26.326 --> 21:29.168
Chyna's gone and
I finally get to be
the star and not her!

21:30.830 --> 21:33.292
Actually, now that
she's in Trifecta,

21:33.292 --> 21:35.465
she's a bigger star
than ever.

21:35.465 --> 21:36.916
Shut up,
we're doing a play!

21:44.884 --> 21:46.476
Well, looks like
Chyna and I aren't

21:46.476 --> 21:49.188
going to be together
anytime soon, so...

21:49.188 --> 21:50.640
I guess it's time
to move on to
my second choice.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.563
Uh, you better not
be looking at me.

21:53.563 --> 21:55.194
I said second choice,
not zombie apocalypse

21:55.194 --> 21:58.778
and you and I are the last
humans alive choice.

22:03.032 --> 22:04.404
(GASPS)

22:04.404 --> 22:06.366
What are those
big kids doing in here?

22:06.366 --> 22:09.288
I don't know.
What do we do?
 Don't look at me.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.210

going to stop?

33:53.072 --> 33:54.953
ALL: Help! Help!

33:54.953 --> 33:56.825
This crazy girl is
trying to kill us!

33:56.825 --> 33:58.247
Oh, that?

33:58.247 --> 34:00.419
We're just rehearsing
a new song called

34:00.419 --> 34:03.582
"Help! Help!
This Crazy Girl Is
Trying to Kill Us!"

34:04.543 --> 34:06.875
Now what?

34:06.875 --> 34:09.967
Maybe we can
use this light to
signal for some help.

34:09.967 --> 34:13.051
Like in Gotham City,
when they used
the bat signal.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.724
We just need to
make our bodies into
the shape of a bat.

34:15.724 --> 34:17.014
Oh. Or we could
make a bunny rabbit!

34:17.014 --> 34:20.018
Ooh, I like that!
Bunnies are much cuter!

34:31.570 --> 34:33.031
One problem.

34:33.031 --> 34:34.193
There's no bunny superhero!

34:35.364 --> 34:35.694
Stop right there!

34:37.826 --> 34:39.788
Bunny... Man?

34:41.460 --> 34:44.002
Excuse me, do you mind?

34:44.002 --> 34:44.583
I'm trying to
roast these people.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.837
Get her, Bunny Man!

34:48.837 --> 34:51.380
Actually, I'm just the
lighthouse keeper.

34:51.380 --> 34:53.512
Then why are you
dressed like a bunny?

34:53.512 --> 34:55.344
I'm in the
middle of a race
with a tortoise.

34:55.344 --> 34:57.556
But don't worry,
I have plenty of time

34:57.556 --> 34:57.716
to find out what
you guys are up to.

35:00.018 --> 35:02.561
Now I will
free these girls!

35:02.561 --> 35:04.183
I may not be a superhero,

35:04.183 --> 35:05.103
but there's one thing
I detest!

35:05.103 --> 35:06.485
Injustice.

35:06.485 --> 35:08.727
Smudges on my light.

35:11.940 --> 35:14.283
I must hop off
into the night.

35:14.283 --> 35:15.824
I have a carrot cake
in the oven.

35:19.158 --> 35:21.160
Now it's time to say
goodbye to Trifecta,

35:21.160 --> 35:24.163
because I'm going solo!

35:24.163 --> 35:26.455
Oh, yeah, well,
I think you need to
clean up your act!

35:27.336 --> 35:28.587
(SCREAMING)

35:33.131 --> 35:34.343
(SPLASHING)

35:37.596 --> 35:38.967
Well, good thing
I got her those

35:38.967 --> 35:39.808
swimming lessons
for Secret Santa.

35:42.851 --> 35:44.853
(SCREAMING)
 Oh, no!

35:44.853 --> 35:47.226
Do you think
she saw a shark?

35:47.226 --> 35:47.816
That wasn't a scream.
That was my ringtone.

35:50.068 --> 35:51.069
Hi, Mom!

35:52.611 --> 35:54.273
Nothing.

36:00.199 --> 36:02.741
Chyna, you got your
first piece of fan mail.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.334
(CHUCKLES)

36:05.334 --> 36:08.877
And you're on the cover of
 Teeny Bopper magazine.

36:08.877 --> 36:12.170
"Trifecta's Newest
Member Gets

36:12.170 --> 36:14.092
"First Piece of Fan Mail."

36:14.092 --> 36:16.885
Wow, this magazine
knows their stuff.

36:16.885 --> 36:20.929
And this postcard is from
Olive and Fletcher,
my best friends!

36:20.929 --> 36:24.102
We know.
We read the article.
 And the postcard.

36:28.267 --> 36:31.520
Dear Chyna. It's me, Olive.
 And Fletcher!

36:31.520 --> 36:32.981
OLIVE: By the
 time you get this,

36:32.981 --> 36:35.274
you should be well
on your way to Seattle.

36:35.274 --> 36:36.945
By the way, I hope
you had an opportunity

36:36.945 --> 36:38.487
to stop at
Oregon's beautiful

36:38.487 --> 36:40.409
Tillamook Rock Lighthouse,

36:40.409 --> 36:42.321
built in 1881,
under the leadership

36:42.321 --> 36:44.583
of George Lewis Gillespie, Jr.

36:44.583 --> 36:46.495
Its gift shop has
delicious kettle corn,

36:46.495 --> 36:48.627
popped fresh by a
delightful but eccentric

36:48.627 --> 36:49.918
lighthouse keeper
in a bunny suit.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.592
FLETCHER: Unbelievable!

36:53.592 --> 36:55.884
Olive took up all the space!

36:55.884 --> 36:58.136
I barely have
any room to write
"I love..."

36:58.136 --> 36:59.678
Hmm.

36:59.678 --> 37:00.839
I wonder what he loves.

37:03.892 --> 37:06.224
I miss those guys so much.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.055
I'm going to call them!

37:08.767 --> 37:11.520
Okay. Sure,
the janitor kicked us out,

37:11.520 --> 37:14.853
but the new Ant Farm has
this great purse hook.

37:17.065 --> 37:19.568
Yeah, and a toilet.
 (FLUSHING)

37:19.568 --> 37:22.741
This is my first day here.
Is it always like this?

37:24.703 --> 37:26.785
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING)

37:26.785 --> 37:28.957
That's Chyna's ring tone!

37:30.959 --> 37:33.712
I can't reach
my A.N.T. Pad.
It's in my backpack!

37:33.712 --> 37:35.424
Will anyone
with a free hand,

37:35.424 --> 37:36.585
reach into
Fletcher's backpack!

37:40.339 --> 37:41.760
Hey!

37:41.760 --> 37:43.512
You with the cold hands.

37:43.512 --> 37:46.345
That is not my backpack!

37:46.345 --> 37:47.646
My first day
keeps getting worse.

37:47.646 --> 37:50.559
Hey, hey, I've got it!

37:50.559 --> 37:52.150
Oh, no!

37:53.892 --> 37:56.815
The toilet's auto flush!
No one move!

37:56.815 --> 37:58.236
ANGUS: Hey, guys.

37:58.236 --> 38:00.028
(FLUSHING)

38:00.028 --> 38:01.450
(ALL EXCLAIMING)

38:03.782 --> 38:05.954
Why did you have to come
into the Ant Farm now?

38:05.954 --> 38:07.496
Ant Farm?

38:17.626 --> 38:19.918
Is everything okay?

38:19.918 --> 38:23.091
I keep trying,
but I can't reach
my best friends.

38:23.091 --> 38:24.763
I used to talk to them
all day at school,

38:24.763 --> 38:28.517
and then more
when I got home.

38:28.517 --> 38:30.308
But I haven't even
spoken to them once
since I left.

38:30.308 --> 38:34.523
Life on the road
isn't easy, is it?

38:34.523 --> 38:35.524
No.

38:37.145 --> 38:38.777
I guess I was just

38:38.777 --> 38:40.939
so excited when
Syerra and Laurin

38:40.939 --> 38:43.071
asked me to join Trifecta

38:43.071 --> 38:45.323
that I didn't really
think about what
I'd be giving up.

38:46.615 --> 38:50.038
My friends, my family.
 Mmm.

38:50.038 --> 38:51.289
I even miss my brother.

38:53.372 --> 38:55.333
What should I do, Gus?

38:55.333 --> 38:58.507
Well, you need to
listen to your heart.

38:58.507 --> 39:01.460
Unless, like mine,

39:01.460 --> 39:04.763
it's saying, "Please
stop eating bacon."

39:04.763 --> 39:05.804
That's just crazy talk.

39:14.933 --> 39:17.235
Sold out?
Well, that's a bit harsh.

39:17.235 --> 39:19.738
I mean I know
they're extremely commercial,

39:19.738 --> 39:20.979
but I wouldn't say
Trifecta's sold out.

39:22.030 --> 39:25.073
The tickets are sold out!

39:25.073 --> 39:26.324
I told you
we should have checked

39:26.324 --> 39:28.537
before we flew to
Seattle to see Chyna.

39:29.408 --> 39:30.989
This is all your fault.

39:30.989 --> 39:33.492
(SCOFFS) Just because I said

39:33.492 --> 39:34.913
"Don't worry.
There's no way
there won't be tickets.

39:34.913 --> 39:36.705
"Let's fly to Seattle
without checking,"

39:36.705 --> 39:37.045
suddenly this is my fault?

39:38.797 --> 39:39.798
Olive!

39:40.629 --> 39:42.340
Fletcher!

39:42.340 --> 39:45.303
What are you guys
doing here?

39:45.303 --> 39:47.305
We came to
see you, Chyna!

39:47.305 --> 39:49.177
And you guys, too.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.641
But really just you.

39:52.641 --> 39:53.642
(LAUGHS)

39:55.143 --> 39:58.517
Well, I've missed you
both so much!

39:58.517 --> 40:01.149
I have a few hours
till the show.
We can hang out.

40:01.149 --> 40:03.572
We should check out
Seattle's famous
Pike's Place Market,

40:03.572 --> 40:07.616
where the fishmongers
are famous for throwing
giant salmon.

40:07.616 --> 40:09.027
I wonder
if it's near here.

40:09.027 --> 40:09.117
(SCREAMS)

40:12.290 --> 40:14.122
(LAUGHS)

40:14.122 --> 40:14.993
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's near here.

40:18.537 --> 40:20.629
LEXI: Okay, let's rehearse

40:20.629 --> 40:22.541
the climactic scene
where our heroine,

40:22.541 --> 40:25.383
the beautiful and
talented Lexi,

40:25.383 --> 40:28.216
has her party ruined
by the evil Chyna.

40:32.350 --> 40:33.141
And begin.

40:33.141 --> 40:35.393
I, the evil Chyna,

40:35.393 --> 40:38.056
will now intentionally
ruin Lexi's party

40:38.056 --> 40:39.558
by destroying her stereo!

40:44.272 --> 40:46.615
Paisley!
That's your line!

40:47.736 --> 40:49.237
Yeah, I have
some questions

40:49.237 --> 40:51.740
about this
Paisley character.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.572
She seems really dumb.

40:53.572 --> 40:54.032
It doesn't seem
believable.

40:56.374 --> 40:57.075
Oh, it's believable.

40:59.167 --> 41:00.208
And why is she
friends with Lexi?

41:00.208 --> 41:03.131
Lexi seems
so full of herself.

41:03.131 --> 41:04.543
Lexi is not
full of herself!

41:04.543 --> 41:07.385
Now can we please
go back to rehearsing

41:07.385 --> 41:09.638
"Lexi: The Musical"
 starring Lexi!

41:11.179 --> 41:14.182
Yeah! Let's do this
Will Smith Style!

41:14.182 --> 41:15.594
(LAUGHS)

41:15.594 --> 41:18.807
Whoo!

41:18.807 --> 41:23.812
If you all want music,
I, the evil Chyna,
can play something.

41:23.812 --> 41:26.404
Just as I'd planned
from the beginning.

41:26.404 --> 41:28.947
No. Everyone would
rather hear

41:28.947 --> 41:32.030
the beautiful
and talented
Lexi sing, right?

41:33.782 --> 41:35.954
The script says
"murmur in agreement!"

41:35.954 --> 41:37.536
So murmur in agreement!

41:37.536 --> 41:38.376
(ALL AGREEING)

41:41.920 --> 41:45.423
Well, if you all insist.

41:45.423 --> 41:49.087
I'll give them
a performance
they'll never forget.

41:49.087 --> 41:52.010
They will if I
use this neuralyzer.

41:52.010 --> 41:52.090
Just stick to the script!

41:54.893 --> 41:55.013
Okay.

41:59.517 --> 42:01.229
(LAUGHING)

42:01.229 --> 42:02.520
Whoo!

42:05.774 --> 42:08.486
Seeing Seattle
with you guys
was amazing!

42:08.486 --> 42:09.948
It was just like
old times,

42:09.948 --> 42:12.070
except with more rain.

42:12.070 --> 42:13.572
And salmon.

42:19.207 --> 42:21.329
Well, the concert
starts soon.

42:21.329 --> 42:22.250
Come on,
I'd better go get ready.

42:23.001 --> 42:25.293
Performers only.

42:25.293 --> 42:26.715
Oh, I'm a part
of Trifecta.

42:26.715 --> 42:31.590
And I'm part of
Bell Biv DeVoe.

42:31.590 --> 42:34.673
Miss, no one
gets back there except
real members of Trifecta.

42:34.673 --> 42:37.676
What makes you think
we aren't real
members of Trifecta?

42:37.676 --> 42:39.307
Well, I've never
actually seen the band,

42:39.307 --> 42:42.891
but I'm pretty sure
it's three girls.

42:42.891 --> 42:46.144
Hey, she may not
be all that feminine,
but she's a girl.

42:48.066 --> 42:49.527
Hey, look.

42:49.527 --> 42:50.989
If you're Trifecta,
then prove it.

42:50.989 --> 42:53.692
Sing that song I heard,

Right before the show,
Chyna asked

45:00.278 --> 45:02.200
