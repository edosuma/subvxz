WEBVTT

00:04.047 --> 00:05.788
And now I've been working

00:05.831 --> 00:07.572
at the Greendale Public Library
for almost seven years.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.358
How marvelous.

00:10.401 --> 00:12.316
And what about your mother?

00:12.360 --> 00:14.144
How is she doing these days?

00:14.188 --> 00:15.841
Oh, um,

00:15.885 --> 00:17.495
not long after we moved
to Greendale,

00:17.539 --> 00:19.410
she died in a tragic accident.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.761
How Gothic.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.677
I'm so sorry, Heather.

00:25.721 --> 00:26.896
It's a long time ago now.

00:28.332 --> 00:30.030
But tell me about you, Cheryl.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.293
Are you...

00:33.990 --> 00:36.297
unattached?

00:36.340 --> 00:41.345
I was seeing someone special
named Toni.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.086
We had a beautiful

00:43.130 --> 00:46.263
and nurturing relationship
for a time.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.657
But we've both gone on
to forge different paths.

00:49.614 --> 00:50.615
We're friends.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.096
Are you...

00:54.097 --> 00:55.577
seeing anyone?

00:57.057 --> 00:58.623
Every now and then.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.451
Nothing serious or long-term.

01:04.499 --> 01:07.458
Oh, my goodness,
it's almost the witching hour.

01:07.502 --> 01:10.635
I better get going
or I'll miss the midnight bus
back to Greendale.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.550
Wait, Heather,
before you leave...

01:16.641 --> 01:18.252
You're a librarian.

01:18.295 --> 01:19.688
By an odd coincidence,

01:19.731 --> 01:21.646
I've had the most cuckoo notion

01:21.690 --> 01:23.126
of turning Thornhill
into Riverdale's

01:23.170 --> 01:25.085
new privately-owned library.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.826
How kismet.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.612
Since you're a scholar
of the library sciences,

01:31.569 --> 01:33.093
would you mind helping me?

01:34.006 --> 01:36.052
Cheryl, of course.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.445
Why don't I come back tomorrow?

01:39.882 --> 01:41.362
Despite my best
efforts to have

01:41.405 --> 01:43.842
Pop's declared
a historic landmark,

01:43.886 --> 01:46.628
my request was denied.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.847
But look, just because Percival
claimed land rights

01:48.891 --> 01:50.762
doesn't mean I'm gonna
let him bulldoze Pop's.

01:52.199 --> 01:54.157
As you've said
many times, Grandpa,

01:54.201 --> 01:56.942
the diner is this town's soul.

01:56.986 --> 01:58.248
Its safe harbor.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.642
Luckily,

02:00.685 --> 02:03.035
I possibly came up with an idea
that could buy us some time.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.303
<i>So, my mother</i> <i>
looked the other way</i>

02:09.346 --> 02:12.044
and allowed my father's evil
to flourish.

02:14.003 --> 02:16.832
She helped him
bury a body

02:16.875 --> 02:19.704
which rotted under our
family dining room table

02:19.748 --> 02:21.445
for decades.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.839
That's the Coopers.

02:23.882 --> 02:28.365
Apple pies served
over an unmarked grave.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.541
And your father was groomed
by his mother to kill,

02:30.585 --> 02:31.673
- wasn't he?
- Hmm.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.414
My disturbing inheritance. Yes.

02:35.503 --> 02:36.330
Agent Cooper...

02:37.635 --> 02:38.593
Betty...

02:40.247 --> 02:43.380
you survived 18 years
of trauma in that house.

02:43.424 --> 02:46.775
And you need
to move out of it, ASAP.

02:46.818 --> 02:48.690
Is there a place you can go to?

02:48.733 --> 02:52.433
A boyfriend's house
or your girlfriend's?

02:52.476 --> 02:53.869
A boyfriend.

02:55.523 --> 02:56.654
Well, thank you

02:56.698 --> 02:59.266
for the impromptu
therapy session,

02:59.309 --> 03:01.181
Agent Drake.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.619
I'm glad you requested
a transfer to help with TBK.

03:04.662 --> 03:07.622
Well, of course.
And it's Jillian.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.537
Or just Drake, if you prefer.

03:13.802 --> 03:15.238
A little walk, huh?

03:15.282 --> 03:16.892
Yeah. Come on.

03:16.935 --> 03:18.850
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.025
We were just about
to go for a walk.
Do you want to join us?

03:20.069 --> 03:22.680
Um, can I ask you
something first?

03:22.724 --> 03:24.291
Yeah. Everything okay?

03:24.334 --> 03:26.597
Yeah, everything's fine. Um...

03:29.383 --> 03:31.211
Would you mind
if I moved in here?

03:31.254 --> 03:34.475
While I untangle
all of my...

03:34.518 --> 03:37.217
- emotional childhood trauma?
- Of course you can.

03:40.872 --> 03:42.265
You can stay for
as long as you need.

03:42.309 --> 03:43.397
We would love to have you.

03:43.440 --> 03:44.354
Right, Bingo?

03:46.226 --> 03:48.053
Okay, come on. Let's go.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.056
Good boy.

03:51.100 --> 03:53.058
<i>Thanks for</i> <i>
talking with us, Janet.</i>

03:53.102 --> 03:54.190
Kevin's still pressing

03:54.234 --> 03:56.018
for full custody
of Baby Anthony.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.933
That's so disappointing.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.501
But I'm happy to help,
of course.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.286
As we discussed,
there are certain circumstances

04:03.330 --> 04:04.809
that are working against you.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.335
Like that we're gangbangers?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.685
And the fact that you both have
criminal records.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.948
Well, how about the fact
that I'm Anthony's mother?

04:12.991 --> 04:14.819
And a high school
guidance counselor

04:14.863 --> 04:16.865
with a master's degree
in social work?

04:16.908 --> 04:18.736
All good points that will be
brought up in court,

04:18.780 --> 04:20.260
but it's not a slam dunk,
I'm afraid.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.221
How about you, Fangs?
Are you working?

04:25.265 --> 04:27.789
Uh, yeah, I was a truck driver,

04:27.832 --> 04:29.704
and now I work part-time

04:29.747 --> 04:31.967
- at Toni's Bar.
- Our bar.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.577
And he takes care
of Baby Anthony

04:33.621 --> 04:35.275
while I'm at school
during the day.

04:35.318 --> 04:37.712
That's got to look good
to a judge.

04:37.755 --> 04:39.540
It depends on the judge,
to be honest.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.934
There's something I want
to pitch to you, Archie.

04:42.978 --> 04:45.110
It's the only way I can think
to save Pop's long-term.

04:46.590 --> 04:48.375
What if we broke the diner down

04:48.418 --> 04:50.551
and moved it to a new,
safe location?

04:50.594 --> 04:52.596
Brick-by-brick.
Somewhere we know for sure

04:52.640 --> 04:56.208
Percival can't claim
eminent domain ever again.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.253
Where do you have in mind?

04:58.080 --> 05:00.125
As of now, TBD.

05:00.169 --> 05:02.911
But in the meantime,
we could just put the diner
into storage.

05:02.954 --> 05:04.782
Once I secure
a piece of protected land,

05:04.826 --> 05:06.915
we can rebuild Pop's.

05:06.958 --> 05:10.397
Look, Percival clearly sees
Pop's as a threat.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.355
The symbol and the headquarters
of the resistance.

05:12.399 --> 05:15.140
- We have to keep it as intact as possible.
- Okay.

05:15.184 --> 05:17.578
Hell yeah. Let me
get a crew together
and get this done for you.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.754
Amazing. Amazing. Thank you.

05:19.797 --> 05:21.451
But we have to do it fast.

05:21.495 --> 05:23.845
Because Percival's
allegedly gonna be bulldozing

05:23.888 --> 05:25.368
in the next few days.

05:25.412 --> 05:27.544
Yeah, well, he sucks.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.677
But don't worry about it.
There'll be nothing there
for him to knock down.

05:31.592 --> 05:35.378
<i>Ah, writer's block,</i>

05:35.422 --> 05:37.424
<i>the constant foe in my life.</i>

05:37.467 --> 05:39.904
<i>And I've run out of ways</i> <i>
to procrastinate.</i>

05:46.955 --> 05:48.435
Reggie and the shareholders

05:48.478 --> 05:51.176
have declared open war
on me, Jughead.

05:51.220 --> 05:52.830
I need money
to build up my war chest

05:52.874 --> 05:54.832
if I want to keep control
of this place.

05:54.876 --> 05:58.749
So, knowing that you
can read minds,

05:58.793 --> 06:00.316
I'm proposing

06:00.360 --> 06:03.363
we use your gift
for our mutual benefit.

06:04.276 --> 06:06.148
And how would that work?

06:06.191 --> 06:07.976
You've heard of those

06:08.019 --> 06:09.281
mentalist acts?

06:10.239 --> 06:12.197
Like the kind in Vegas?

06:12.241 --> 06:14.243
I want to present one here.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.679
You can be the seer.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.029
I'll be your Girl Friday,
working the crowd.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.989
You read a few minds,
astonish a few out-of-towners,

06:21.032 --> 06:23.383
and we make some bucks.

06:23.426 --> 06:26.081
Sixty-forty split.
My way, of course.

06:29.911 --> 06:31.782
Fifty-fifty.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.436
And we only read
the minds of the willing.

06:34.481 --> 06:35.743
Done and done.

06:40.182 --> 06:42.140
Okay, guys, it's been a minute.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.187
We got a new gig lined up.

06:45.230 --> 06:46.536
Andrews Construction

06:46.580 --> 06:48.582
is gonna tear down
and rebuild Pop's.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.758
This a union job?

06:50.801 --> 06:52.455
It is, Carlos. Which means, uh,

06:52.499 --> 06:54.283
health benefits,
time-and-a-half,

06:54.326 --> 06:57.417
pension plans, and no scabs.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.115
What do you guys say?
You ready to save Pop's?

07:00.158 --> 07:02.509
Yeah!

07:07.557 --> 07:08.776
Hey.

07:08.819 --> 07:10.908
- Hey.
- Anthony just went down.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.868
How was your day?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.565
It was good. It was good.

07:15.609 --> 07:18.220
Archie's putting together
a new crew to help move Pop's.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.962
So I signed up.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.268
Okay. Well, we should
probably talk to Janet

07:23.312 --> 07:25.836
before we make
any big life changes.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.621
Fine.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.492
But I want to start pulling
my weight around here, Toni.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.016
I don't want the judge to think
I'm some kind of freeloader.

07:32.060 --> 07:33.191
"Freeloader"?

07:38.501 --> 07:40.895
Are you joking?

07:40.938 --> 07:43.375
I couldn't do any of this
without you.

07:43.419 --> 07:44.986
I hear you. I hear you.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.684
I just want to do everything
that I possibly can

07:47.728 --> 07:49.469
to help provide
for Baby Anthony.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.388
I think it'll make me
a better father.

07:57.694 --> 08:00.958
You're already
an amazing father.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.485
We'll make this work.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.400
Thanks, Toni.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.406
Hey, guys.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.800
I'm just gonna grab
a couple things.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.367
Where's Grandma?

08:18.410 --> 08:19.847
Upstairs. Resting.

08:20.804 --> 08:21.979
What are you guys up to?

08:30.074 --> 08:31.598
Where did you get that cat?

08:31.641 --> 08:32.773
Granny got him for us.

08:35.471 --> 08:36.428
Oh.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.256
What's his name?

08:38.300 --> 08:39.910
Butterscotch.

08:39.954 --> 08:42.086
We're gonna have so much fun
playing with his tail.

08:50.747 --> 08:51.705
Um...

08:54.403 --> 08:57.449
I'm just gonna borrow
Butterscotch for a little bit

08:57.493 --> 09:01.366
and make sure that he has
all of his shots and whatnot.

09:01.410 --> 09:04.152
Okay. But bring him back soon
so he can catch mice for us.

09:06.023 --> 09:06.937
Okay.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.510
I need
your insight, Drake.

09:58.554 --> 10:01.383
Regarding some more
fringe science stuff.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.646
Of course,
always happy to help.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.256
Oh.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.085
What would you say
if I told you that I recently

10:08.129 --> 10:10.914
acquired the ability

10:10.958 --> 10:14.352
to see auras around
people who are...

10:15.266 --> 10:17.094
threats?

10:17.138 --> 10:19.706
Auras are the energy fields
that emanate from us.

10:19.749 --> 10:23.535
Some people are more sensitive
and can see those vibrations.

10:23.579 --> 10:26.800
Sounds like you detect
hostile energy fields.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.846
Last night, I saw an aura
around my nephew, Dagwood,

10:29.890 --> 10:32.501
but not around
his twin sister, Juniper.

10:32.544 --> 10:35.286
So, I was worried
Dagwood was having

10:35.330 --> 10:38.681
evil impulses towards
a newly acquired pet.

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
Now in a shelter.

10:40.770 --> 10:44.252
Impulses that he hasn't
acted on yet, thank God,

10:44.295 --> 10:45.601
but it felt like a...

10:45.645 --> 10:47.516
like a brewing threat.

10:47.559 --> 10:49.300
Who else have you seen
an aura around?

10:49.344 --> 10:50.911
Killers.

10:50.954 --> 10:53.130
- People who are about to cause harm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.436
But there are exceptions.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.046
I didn't see
an aura around TBK,

10:56.090 --> 10:59.006
even though he was
planning to attack Archie.

10:59.049 --> 11:02.357
It's like I have a blind spot
for some people.

11:02.400 --> 11:05.403
One that I would like
to figure out and remove.

11:05.447 --> 11:08.493
Well, the twins could be
a sort of test-case scenario.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.582
For a while I thought maybe
they could have inherited

11:10.626 --> 11:12.715
the MAOA gene.

11:12.759 --> 11:16.545
It runs in my family.
I have it, my mother has it.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.460
Maybe Dagwood
inherited the gene,

11:18.503 --> 11:21.550
and that's why I could see
his aura,

11:21.593 --> 11:26.207
because he's
a killer-in-the-making?

11:26.250 --> 11:27.904
Get the twins tested
for the gene.

11:27.948 --> 11:31.081
Find out if one or both,
or neither has it.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.649
Know a doctor
who would do that?

11:37.566 --> 11:38.959
Thank you for seeing us

11:39.002 --> 11:41.091
on such short notice,
Dr. Curdle.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.180
Of course, Miss Cooper.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.792
And are these the subjects

11:45.835 --> 11:48.490
we'll be testing
for the MAOA gene?

11:48.533 --> 11:50.840
Yeah. These are
my niece and nephew,

11:50.884 --> 11:53.974
Juniper and Dagwood.

11:54.017 --> 11:57.542
<i>Now,</i> <i>
let's set an intention</i> <i>
for your new library.</i>

11:59.936 --> 12:02.243
Smoke of air and fire of earth,

12:02.286 --> 12:05.768
cleanse and bless
this home and hearth.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.727
Under careful cultivation,

12:09.032 --> 12:10.860
create a space for...

12:12.122 --> 12:13.080
innovation.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.737
You know, Heather...

12:20.261 --> 12:22.480
I, too, am a student
of the arcane arts.

12:24.395 --> 12:25.962
Studying Wicca,

12:26.006 --> 12:27.964
worshipping the goddess Hecate,

12:29.009 --> 12:30.619
it helped me self-actualize.

12:31.446 --> 12:32.926
That's beautiful.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.624
I, too, have
dabbled in the occult.

12:35.667 --> 12:36.930
Tell me more about that.

12:48.942 --> 12:51.683
Unbelievable.

12:51.727 --> 12:53.294
And this is what
it must've looked like

12:53.337 --> 12:54.861
back in the day
before it opened up.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.255
So much potential. Huh.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.563
Well, it's like
you said, Tabitha,

13:01.606 --> 13:03.043
- it's only temporary.
- Hello.

13:04.087 --> 13:07.264
Oh, I'm so sorry to intrude.

13:07.308 --> 13:09.919
I just... I thought I'd
check on my property...

13:11.921 --> 13:14.837
and on this fine crew
you've assembled.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.665
And let them know
about a job opportunity

13:16.708 --> 13:17.971
I might have for them.

13:18.014 --> 13:20.712
We're already
on a job here, Percival.

13:20.756 --> 13:24.847
Yes, but my railroad project
is set to begin in earnest, so.

13:24.891 --> 13:26.414
And as foreman,
I would like to offer

13:26.457 --> 13:29.156
each and every one of you
a place on our crew.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.853
It's long-term.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.463
Higher wages, signing bonus.

13:34.161 --> 13:36.467
And not a penny in union dues.

13:36.511 --> 13:39.166
We're all long-term
union members here, Frank,

13:39.209 --> 13:40.732
like you used to be.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.647
Like my dad fought for.

13:42.691 --> 13:44.954
Nobody wants
what you're selling.

13:44.998 --> 13:47.739
Perhaps your crew would like
to speak for themselves.

13:47.783 --> 13:51.482
Yeah, actually, I'm interested.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.093
Fangs, you can't be serious.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.878
Toni and I are drowning
in legal bills, Archie.

13:55.922 --> 13:59.751
If there's an offer
for longer-term work
with less dues, more money--

13:59.795 --> 14:03.190
That is exactly
what we're offering.

14:03.233 --> 14:04.887
Glad to have
you aboard, Mr. Fogarty.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.716
As for the rest of you,

14:07.759 --> 14:10.458
we hope you'll consider
the offer to join our team.

14:10.501 --> 14:12.068
Sooner rather than later.

Ladies and gentlemen,

you're in for a treat tonight.

14:52.761 --> 14:54.763
The Babylonium
is proud to present

14:54.806 --> 14:56.852
The Seer of the Southside,

14:56.896 --> 14:58.071
Forsythe the Fantastic!

15:05.034 --> 15:06.862
Now, remember,
ladies and gentlemen...

15:08.646 --> 15:10.344
we can all see

15:10.387 --> 15:11.954
this brave soul's number.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.263
But Forsythe
the Fantastic cannot.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.048
Or can he?

15:19.962 --> 15:20.789
Forsythe?

15:21.964 --> 15:23.400
Yes.

15:23.444 --> 15:25.315
I do see something
through the fog.

15:27.143 --> 15:28.971
Is it...

15:29.015 --> 15:32.148
115,658?

15:33.671 --> 15:35.673
It is indeed.

15:35.717 --> 15:37.066
Bravo, Forsythe.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.938
Seer of the Southside!

15:50.079 --> 15:51.515
What the hell?

15:51.559 --> 15:52.603
Oh, my God.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.477
We left this truck
fully loaded last night.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.044
I locked it myself.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.437
- Who'd steal booths and tables?
- Wait, Archie.

16:02.004 --> 16:03.179
You have to see this.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.837
Who could've done this?
And why?

16:08.880 --> 16:11.013
This has Percival's
fingerprints all over it.

16:11.057 --> 16:12.884
Agreed.

16:12.928 --> 16:14.538
He wants to flatten the diner
with everything still in it.

16:14.582 --> 16:16.105
Tough luck

16:16.149 --> 16:18.238
'cause we're getting it all
out of here again.

16:18.281 --> 16:20.240
Double-time. Come on.

16:20.283 --> 16:22.024
And I will deal with Percival.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.386
- Percival.
- Mm.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.388
I just came from Pop's,
where all the furniture

16:38.432 --> 16:40.129
and the decor
that was in a moving truck

16:40.173 --> 16:43.263
is now suddenly
back inside the diner.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.916
Stop messing with me.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.657
Ms. Tate,

16:46.701 --> 16:48.181
I have legitimately no idea
what you're talking about.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.618
I want you off
that property, remember?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.315
No, no, no, no. What you want

16:52.359 --> 16:54.317
is you want Pop's
and its contents destroyed.

16:55.449 --> 16:56.624
And for the hundredth time,

16:56.667 --> 16:58.017
- that's not gonna happen.
- Mmm.

16:58.930 --> 16:59.975
Oops.

17:12.466 --> 17:14.424
<i>♪ After you, who</i>

17:16.557 --> 17:20.430
<i>♪ Could supply</i> <i>
My sky of blue? ♪</i>

17:21.736 --> 17:24.086
Help! Help!

17:24.130 --> 17:26.915
- What happened?
- Sam got electrocuted trying to move the jukebox!

17:27.611 --> 17:28.699
Oh, my God.

17:35.184 --> 17:36.838
<i>Agent Cooper.</i>

17:36.881 --> 17:38.579
Dr. Curdle, hi.

17:38.622 --> 17:41.582
Do you have the twins'
MAOA test results back already?

17:41.625 --> 17:42.887
<i>Indeed.</i>

17:42.931 --> 17:46.108
And the girl has the gene,

17:46.152 --> 17:47.849
but the boy does not.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.288
<i>Okay, so I can see</i>

17:52.332 --> 17:55.161
Dagwood's aura,
but he doesn't have the gene.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.728
Juniper, on the other hand,
has the MAOA gene,

17:57.772 --> 17:59.426
and no apparent aura.

17:59.469 --> 18:01.123
Maybe it's counterintuitive.

18:01.167 --> 18:03.256
Meaning those who have
the serial killer gene

18:03.299 --> 18:05.388
are the ones in my blind spot?

18:05.432 --> 18:09.914
Yes. The MAOA gene
produces a specific enzyme.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.874
You have it, Juniper has it.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.094
Maybe that enzyme
is masking your ability

18:15.137 --> 18:16.921
to detect the aura in question.

18:19.228 --> 18:20.621
Now the million-dollar
question is,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.188
how do we test this new theory?

18:25.408 --> 18:27.932
That guy
from the hospital. Trevor.
I saw his aura.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.369
I also saw Cheryl's aura

18:29.412 --> 18:31.719
when she was being
inhabited by Abigail.

18:31.762 --> 18:33.547
Great. Let's get them tested
for the gene.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.853
Yeah.

18:35.897 --> 18:37.899
But first we gotta get
the twins out of that house
and away from my mom.

18:37.942 --> 18:39.640
You don't think she'd
hurt them, do you?

18:39.683 --> 18:41.032
Not intentionally,

18:41.076 --> 18:42.904
but she's in deep
with Percival Pickens.

18:42.947 --> 18:44.775
And if the twins have
any inclination

18:44.819 --> 18:47.517
towards violence and mayhem,

18:47.561 --> 18:49.302
I don't want them
crossing paths with him.

18:55.873 --> 18:58.920
Reggie, I have nothing
to say to you until our
next board meeting.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.617
Yeah, well, I do.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.185
And it's not something
one discusses over the phone.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.666
Your act with Jones.
I want a cut.

19:06.710 --> 19:07.624
Wow.

19:08.669 --> 19:11.585
Even for you. Wow.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.240
You are so unburdened
by intelligence

19:14.283 --> 19:16.633
or reason,
I am almost in awe.

19:16.677 --> 19:19.941
Why on earth would I give you
a cut of our act?

19:21.725 --> 19:24.728
Because I know
your secrets, Ronnie.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.991
What would happen
if I told Percival

19:27.035 --> 19:29.559
you're the one that
put a hit on Hiram?

19:29.603 --> 19:32.301
That tidbit alone
would destroy your career,

19:32.345 --> 19:36.349
your reputation,
and probably land you in jail.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.046
Blackmailing me, Reggie?

19:39.526 --> 19:41.441
Is that how you roll now?

19:41.484 --> 19:43.182
I'm not trying
to be greedy about it.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.009
All I want

19:45.836 --> 19:48.796
is 20%, let's say.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.152
Um, whose car is out front?

19:58.632 --> 20:00.111
Ours.

20:00.155 --> 20:02.070
I used my signing bonus
as a down payment.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.423
Archie gave you
a signing bonus?

20:07.467 --> 20:10.078
Uh, no.

20:10.121 --> 20:13.342
Perceval did.
I joined his crew.

20:13.386 --> 20:15.692
He's paying almost double
what Archie is.

20:15.736 --> 20:18.347
Fangs, Percival is
evil incarnate.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.044
He's trying
to dismantle Riverdale.

20:20.088 --> 20:21.655
And for all we know,
he could have been responsible

20:21.698 --> 20:23.787
for Baby Anthony's kidnapping.

20:23.831 --> 20:26.137
People are saying
he can control their minds.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.704
For instance, Kevin,

20:27.748 --> 20:29.532
Alice, Frank.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.579
Yeah, Archie already
warned me about that.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.407
He told me that I can use

20:34.450 --> 20:37.366
an emotional tether
to keep that from happening.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.586
Baby Anthony will be my tether.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.286
<i>The Queen of Wands.</i>

20:44.330 --> 20:46.723
Well, I do consider
myself a queen.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.073
This card represents
a new strength

20:49.117 --> 20:51.119
or ability you've discovered.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.382
A power within you
that has ignited.

20:55.079 --> 20:57.343
That might be accurate.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.172
The Lovers.

21:02.391 --> 21:04.524
You yearn for connection.

21:05.394 --> 21:06.265
Intimacy.

21:07.396 --> 21:09.093
Love.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.095
Don't we all yearn
for those things?

21:15.796 --> 21:18.364
Oh. That doesn't look good.

21:18.407 --> 21:20.279
It isn't.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.803
The Tower is a dark card,

21:22.846 --> 21:26.372
promising disaster,
carnage, war.

21:27.721 --> 21:29.375
Welcome to Riverdale.

21:29.418 --> 21:30.724
<i>What happened, Archie?</i>

21:30.767 --> 21:32.421
It was
a freak accident.

21:32.465 --> 21:35.119
One of my guys got electrocuted
moving the jukebox.

21:35.163 --> 21:36.599
Must have been
some frayed wiring.

21:36.643 --> 21:38.514
No, no, that's not possible.

21:38.558 --> 21:41.169
I had the jukebox serviced
two months ago.

21:41.212 --> 21:43.563
It was perfectly fine.

21:43.606 --> 21:46.914
<i>Here's an unexpected bonus</i> <i>
from helping Veronica.</i>

21:46.957 --> 21:48.481
<i>I finally started</i> <i>
writing again.</i>

21:49.656 --> 21:51.048
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

21:51.092 --> 21:52.659
<i>It all should have been</i> <i>
smooth sailing</i>

21:52.702 --> 21:53.921
<i>from now on if not for...</i>

21:59.143 --> 22:00.754
Reggie's blackmailing you?

22:01.972 --> 22:03.583
See,

22:03.626 --> 22:05.672
this is why I never liked him.
Even in high school.

22:05.715 --> 22:07.456
I know, he's the worst.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.328
But he has a certain
piece of information

22:09.371 --> 22:12.548
that could destroy me
if it got out.

22:12.592 --> 22:16.465
So, I was wondering,
since you can read minds,

22:17.336 --> 22:20.469
you can't erase them

22:20.513 --> 22:21.644
as well, can you?

22:21.688 --> 22:24.038
You mean mind-wipe Reggie?

22:24.081 --> 22:26.606
Not his entire mind.
Small, though, it may be.

22:29.043 --> 22:30.479
Just the fact that I...

22:31.654 --> 22:32.916
ordered a hit on my father.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.356
Yeah, you know,
I always wondered about that.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.184
I have made my peace with it.

22:40.228 --> 22:43.623
Okay. Let me
be honest with you. Um...

22:43.666 --> 22:47.235
first off, I don't even know
if that kind of surgical wipe

22:47.278 --> 22:50.194
is possible,
or if it's something
I'm even capable of.

22:51.544 --> 22:52.980
But I can do my research.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.207
What the hell?

23:24.098 --> 23:25.969
I wouldn't be saying
the diner's haunted

23:26.013 --> 23:27.971
if I hadn't seen the ghosts
with my own eyes, Archie.

23:28.015 --> 23:30.234
And then I talked
to my grandpa,
and sure enough,

23:30.278 --> 23:32.367
people have died at Pop's.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.325
They are the ones
causing problems.

23:34.369 --> 23:36.502
Look, to be honest, Tabitha,

23:36.545 --> 23:39.026
a haunted diner is the least
of my worries right now.

23:39.069 --> 23:41.463
I mean, I've been
getting calls all morning.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.247
Sam's electrocution
was a tipping point.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.075
A lot of my crew's quit.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.556
They've gone over to work
for Percival and Uncle Frank.

23:49.123 --> 23:50.429
Okay, look, Archie, I will...

23:50.472 --> 23:52.735
I will figure out
our ghost problem,

23:52.779 --> 23:54.258
but we still need
to move the diner

23:54.302 --> 23:56.260
before Percival seizes control
of the land.

23:56.304 --> 23:59.220
We will. I'll get my crew back.

23:59.263 --> 24:01.352
<i>Thanks for coming,</i> <i>
Uncle Frank.</i>

24:01.396 --> 24:02.441
Drinks are on me.

24:03.354 --> 24:04.399
Here's my Chime card.

24:07.837 --> 24:11.188
Look, Frank, I don't want
to fight with you.

24:11.232 --> 24:12.755
I just want us to talk.

24:15.279 --> 24:17.020
You know what my dad
would say to us right now?

24:18.152 --> 24:19.458
He'd say that no matter what

24:20.284 --> 24:22.286
we're blood.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.288
And he wouldn't put up with us
behaving like this.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.639
He'd demand us to find a way
back to each other.

24:28.815 --> 24:30.512
Your dad was an idealist.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.395
We can disagree
on some things, Frank,

24:44.439 --> 24:47.834
but here are two things
that I know we both love.

24:47.877 --> 24:51.054
Pop's diner
and Andrews Construction.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.534
Can't we put our
differences aside?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.189
At least until we get this
one job finished?

24:56.059 --> 24:57.191
In honor of my dad?

25:08.289 --> 25:10.509
According to the test results,
neither Cheryl

25:10.552 --> 25:12.249
nor orderly Trevor

25:12.293 --> 25:13.773
have the serial killer gene.

25:13.816 --> 25:16.906
Okay, then.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.909
Based on all the information
we gathered,

25:19.953 --> 25:21.215
our best hypothesis is that

25:21.258 --> 25:24.174
your blind spot
is the MAOA gene.

25:24.218 --> 25:25.872
Its presence seems

25:25.915 --> 25:29.484
to short-circuit your ability
to detect auras.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.617
Maybe there's some
kind of work-around?

25:31.660 --> 25:35.185
Well, reading auras
is an inexact science.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.624
It's part psychological,
part biological.

25:38.667 --> 25:40.451
Now that we've established
a working theory

25:40.495 --> 25:42.845
on why you have a blind spot,

25:42.889 --> 25:44.673
your brain may process, absorb,

25:44.717 --> 25:46.632
and therefore
perceive auras differently.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.507
Otherwise, I've been
meaning to ask.

25:53.769 --> 25:55.554
How's living
with the boyfriend?

25:56.816 --> 25:58.600
<i>I'm desperate, Cheryl.</i>

25:58.644 --> 26:00.776
Time traveling is one thing,
but this, this is--

26:00.820 --> 26:03.518
Sounds like a classic haunting.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.826
Those ghosts are lingering.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.436
Oh, my friend Heather
is quite knowledgeable

26:08.479 --> 26:10.307
in things that go
bump in the night.

26:10.351 --> 26:13.746
Well, they are sabotaging
our efforts to save Pop's.

26:13.789 --> 26:16.749
Why haven't they moved on?

26:16.792 --> 26:19.839
It could be that they're afraid
of what awaits them
in the afterlife.

26:19.882 --> 26:22.537
Or they have
unfinished business here

26:22.581 --> 26:23.930
on this mortal coil.

26:23.973 --> 26:24.974
Concur.

26:26.759 --> 26:29.152
I have had some
experience facilitating

26:29.196 --> 26:31.938
communication between
mortals and spirits.

26:31.981 --> 26:33.722
Perhaps I can invoke them

26:33.766 --> 26:36.812
and help them move on,
as you say.

26:36.856 --> 26:38.771
Perhaps we...

26:38.814 --> 26:40.860
both can help.

26:47.867 --> 26:50.826
Hear these names
and cross the divide.

26:50.870 --> 26:53.873
Mona Mitchell and Gilda Snide.

26:53.916 --> 26:57.050
Join us here and do not hide.

26:57.093 --> 27:00.053
Marcus Lee and Jenny Bride.

27:15.155 --> 27:16.504
Who will speak for the dead?

27:18.332 --> 27:20.769
I will. Gilda Snide.

27:20.813 --> 27:23.076
Why are you
still here, spirits?

27:23.119 --> 27:24.686
Do you have
unfinished business?

27:24.730 --> 27:27.515
We're bound to this place.
We must bear witness.

27:27.994 --> 27:29.691
To what?

27:29.735 --> 27:32.781
To the battle that approaches
between good and evil.

27:32.825 --> 27:34.783
Only then
can we complete our journey.

27:34.827 --> 27:36.219
Fine, bear witness,

27:36.263 --> 27:38.744
but we need you
to stop sabotaging us.

27:38.787 --> 27:42.182
We must protect this place.
It is the final battleground.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.226
We know,

27:43.270 --> 27:44.837
but we're only moving it.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.969
Pop's will be rebuilt soon.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.580
There can be no disruption.

27:49.624 --> 27:51.321
Oh, my God.
Work with us, people.

27:51.365 --> 27:52.714
Percival Pickens,

27:52.758 --> 27:54.673
the man who is
taking over this land

27:54.716 --> 27:56.849
wants to destroy the diner
to cripple the resistance

27:56.892 --> 27:58.851
and build his
stupid train here.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.156
- "Train"?
- Wait.

28:01.201 --> 28:02.724
Why does that frighten you?

28:02.768 --> 28:05.161
Is he building the ghost train?

28:05.205 --> 28:06.946
What the hell
is the ghost train?

28:06.989 --> 28:10.645
An engine that grants
its conductor great power.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.256
Dominion over the realms
of the living and the dead.

28:13.300 --> 28:14.605
So please, let's just...

28:14.649 --> 28:17.783
let's find a way
to work together.

28:17.826 --> 28:20.568
The diner cannot be broken-down
for long.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.963
If it is, we will dissipate
into the ether.

28:24.006 --> 28:26.487
If that happens,
there will be no witnesses,

28:26.530 --> 28:28.924
and the final battle
cannot take place.

28:28.968 --> 28:30.970
And there will be
no opportunity

28:31.013 --> 28:33.494
to defeat the Eldritch evil.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.539
Which is why
Percival has been so hell-bent

28:35.583 --> 28:37.803
on destroying Pop's.

28:37.846 --> 28:39.500
This is all starting
to make sense.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.806
- Is it?
- Okay. So, to be clear,

28:40.849 --> 28:42.633
we can disassemble the diner

28:42.677 --> 28:45.462
so long as we do not
put it into deep storage

28:45.506 --> 28:47.769
and we find some other place
to rebuild it

28:47.813 --> 28:49.379
as quickly as possible?

28:54.515 --> 28:55.951
How could you, Elizabeth?

28:57.736 --> 28:59.346
How could you
steal those children from me?

28:59.389 --> 29:01.130
I'm their grandmother.

29:01.174 --> 29:02.479
You are not
in the right headspace

29:02.523 --> 29:03.959
to be taking care of children.

29:04.003 --> 29:05.569
I am their guardian,

29:05.613 --> 29:07.571
I am perfectly capable
of taking care of them.

29:07.615 --> 29:10.574
You know what, Mom?
There's evil in that house.
Real evil.

29:10.618 --> 29:13.099
And I don't want the twins
growing up the same way I did.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.753
I am trying to protect them.

29:14.796 --> 29:16.755
"Protect them." What, trying
to protect them from me?

29:19.061 --> 29:20.280
How dare you?

29:21.020 --> 29:23.370
How dare you?

29:23.413 --> 29:25.154
Do you even care
about people's feelings?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.896
- Do you even have feelings?
- Of course I do.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.116
All of the love in the world
and all of the sacrifice,

29:30.159 --> 29:32.596
and it was never enough.
It was never enough for you!

29:33.902 --> 29:35.469
You always had to...

29:35.512 --> 29:37.558
You always had
to conjure up these villains

29:37.601 --> 29:39.821
to explain everything
that was wrong with you.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.824
But did you ever stop to think
that maybe you're the villain?

29:42.868 --> 29:45.044
You need to stop looking
for monsters under the bed

29:45.087 --> 29:46.959
and in the closets

29:47.002 --> 29:49.483
and just stop and take
a really good look
in the mirror.

29:51.615 --> 29:55.576
Despite everything that
I did as a mother,

29:55.619 --> 29:58.100
you have always been
a bad person.

29:59.580 --> 30:02.061
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

30:02.104 --> 30:03.845
And I hope that you're
never a mother,

30:03.889 --> 30:05.542
so you don't have to experience

30:05.586 --> 30:07.457
the things that you
have made me endure.

30:12.854 --> 30:16.118
I hate asking this
of you, Archie,

30:16.162 --> 30:18.555
but can we set up the diner
at the El Royale?

30:18.599 --> 30:20.601
The booths,
the counter, the jukebox?

30:20.644 --> 30:22.342
So that the Pop's continuum
isn't broken?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.779
Of course, Tabitha.

30:24.823 --> 30:28.478
But this might mean that
the El Royal winds up

30:28.522 --> 30:30.698
haunted for a time.

30:30.741 --> 30:33.135
Well, ghosts don't
scare me, so...

30:33.179 --> 30:34.180
Me neither.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.878
Uncle Frank.

30:41.883 --> 30:42.928
Archie...

30:45.104 --> 30:46.322
I have been looking
at this picture

30:46.366 --> 30:48.890
ever since you gave it to me.

30:48.934 --> 30:51.153
Thinking about what you said,
about what your dad would say.

30:53.721 --> 30:56.028
You were right.

30:56.071 --> 30:58.073
He'd want us to find our way
back to each other.

30:59.379 --> 31:01.294
And to save Pop's.

31:01.337 --> 31:05.385
So, me and a few of my guys
are willing to, uh...

31:06.255 --> 31:08.127
call in sick,

31:08.170 --> 31:10.912
help you move the diner,
if we can do it fast.

31:12.958 --> 31:14.046
And if you'll have us.

31:21.270 --> 31:23.577
<i>That's a relief</i> <i>
about your uncle, Arch.</i>

31:23.620 --> 31:25.100
I'm happy for you.

31:25.144 --> 31:27.276
Yeah. And it probably means

31:27.320 --> 31:28.712
there's still hope
for your mom, Betty.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.280
Maybe.

31:31.324 --> 31:33.543
She's in pretty deep
with Percival.

31:33.587 --> 31:34.849
Yeah.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.982
But what's the next step
for Pop's?

31:37.025 --> 31:38.853
Well, we move
everything out tomorrow,

31:38.897 --> 31:40.376
which is perfect timing
because Frank says

31:40.420 --> 31:42.335
the bulldozers
are on their way.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.903
Hmm. Could you
use an extra hand?

31:44.946 --> 31:47.949
I can swing by tomorrow morning
after I do a couple things.

31:47.993 --> 31:50.212
I could use
all the help I could get.

31:50.256 --> 31:51.648
Especially if it's from you.

31:59.439 --> 32:01.441
<i>I did my due diligence.</i>

32:01.484 --> 32:03.051
<i>What Veronica was asking for</i>

32:03.095 --> 32:05.619
<i>was something called</i> <i>
telepathic erasure.</i>

32:05.662 --> 32:07.664
<i>The removal of specific</i> <i>
images and thoughts</i>

32:07.708 --> 32:09.362
<i>from someone's memory.</i>

32:09.405 --> 32:11.886
<i>Turns out, it's possible.</i>

32:11.930 --> 32:14.149
<i>To do it,</i> <i>
the someone being mind-wiped</i>

32:14.193 --> 32:16.108
<i>has to be either asleep</i> <i>
or distracted enough</i>

32:16.151 --> 32:18.197
<i>so that their</i> <i>
subconscious is unguarded.</i>

32:19.502 --> 32:20.416
<i>There you go.</i>

32:22.201 --> 32:24.377
Sorry, it's small
bills tonight.

32:24.420 --> 32:25.900
You know I'll have to count it.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.293
Take all the time you need.

33:14.775 --> 33:16.037
Everything
all right, Reginald?

33:19.780 --> 33:20.781
Yeah, we're good.

33:23.827 --> 33:25.220
Great.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.353
Because I've just had
a change of heart.

33:27.396 --> 33:29.050
From this moment on,
we'll no longer be sharing

33:29.094 --> 33:30.704
any of our profits with you.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.706
Okay, don't push me, Ronnie.
I'll tell Percival.

33:32.749 --> 33:34.142
Tell him about...

33:34.882 --> 33:35.709
what?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.103
About that thing.

33:39.017 --> 33:40.018
Um...

33:42.150 --> 33:43.891
Why don't you
have a think on it?

33:43.934 --> 33:46.807
In the meantime,
get the hell out of my office.

34:02.083 --> 34:05.086
Thought you said we still had
a ton of work to do, Red.

34:05.130 --> 34:06.131
Well, we did.

34:10.178 --> 34:13.225
Looks like some
good Samaritan souls
gave us a head start.

34:13.268 --> 34:15.705
All right, well, Uncle Frank,
you and a couple guys

34:15.749 --> 34:18.186
load up the truck,
head to the El Royale.

34:18.230 --> 34:20.145
The rest of us, let's start
dismantling the diner.

34:32.287 --> 34:34.202
You know, Heather,

34:34.246 --> 34:35.943
I was already quite impressed
with your knowledge

34:35.986 --> 34:38.946
of the realm
of the unseen arts,

34:38.989 --> 34:41.688
but what you did
back at Pop's...

34:41.731 --> 34:44.517
that was necromancy, wasn't it?

34:45.344 --> 34:46.432
Death magic?

34:47.737 --> 34:50.349
Yes, Cheryl.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.742
After my mother died,
I was taken in

34:52.786 --> 34:55.397
by a group of women
who raised me.

34:55.441 --> 34:59.184
A powerful coven in Greendale.

34:59.227 --> 35:01.447
I'm not just Wiccan, Cheryl.

35:02.926 --> 35:03.797
I'm...

35:05.015 --> 35:05.842
a witch.

35:07.670 --> 35:09.803
They taught me
everything I know.

35:09.846 --> 35:12.022
And based on
what I've observed here,

35:12.066 --> 35:14.112
and I wouldn't want
to put a label on you,

35:15.330 --> 35:17.550
but I suspect

35:17.593 --> 35:20.161
you may be a witch as well.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.295
I...

35:23.338 --> 35:25.906
haven't used that word
to describe myself yet,

35:26.515 --> 35:28.256
no,

35:28.300 --> 35:31.346
but I feel as if I've been
dancing around it for months,

35:32.086 --> 35:33.174
if not years.

35:34.697 --> 35:35.655
And then there's this.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.660
Pyrokinesis.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.053
Heather,

35:43.924 --> 35:44.925
if you are

35:45.795 --> 35:48.189
what you say you are,

35:48.233 --> 35:50.844
and I am, too,

35:50.887 --> 35:53.455
would you teach me
what you know?

35:53.499 --> 35:55.022
I've been walking along
this witchy path

35:55.065 --> 35:56.632
for quite some time,

35:57.546 --> 35:58.547
but mostly alone.

36:00.723 --> 36:01.681
Cheryl...

36:05.075 --> 36:06.425
I'd love that.

36:08.688 --> 36:10.037
<i>What is it, Reggie?</i>

36:10.080 --> 36:12.822
You look more perplexed
than usual.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.433
I'm not sure.

36:14.476 --> 36:18.480
I think Jughead and Veronica
did something to me.

36:18.524 --> 36:20.395
Made me forget something.

36:20.439 --> 36:22.876
But I have no idea what it is.

36:24.051 --> 36:25.183
Is that possible?

36:26.009 --> 36:28.229
Hmm.

36:28.273 --> 36:30.231
Perhaps Jughead's
telepathic abilities

36:30.275 --> 36:32.929
have gotten stronger
since they first manifested.

36:35.715 --> 36:38.108
Hey, Frank.

36:38.152 --> 36:40.372
I came to help, but it looks
like you're already done.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.156
Yeah. Out here, anyway.

36:42.200 --> 36:43.853
Archie could probably use
a hand inside, though.

36:51.296 --> 36:52.471
Everything okay?

36:54.168 --> 36:55.125
Yeah.

37:01.697 --> 37:02.829
We have a problem...

37:04.265 --> 37:05.223
with your uncle.

37:07.660 --> 37:09.314
Hey, I'm just gonna
drive this stuff

37:09.357 --> 37:11.272
- over to the El Royale, cool?
- No.

37:13.753 --> 37:17.147
I know you were gonna
drive this into
Sweetwater River.

37:17.191 --> 37:19.933
Or maybe a big bonfire
at the town dump?

37:19.976 --> 37:22.501
Whatever your plan was,
Uncle Frank, you're busted.

37:25.591 --> 37:26.940
How'd you know?

37:26.983 --> 37:29.203
Give me the keys.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.858
You know, I didn't want it
to come to this, Archie,

37:32.598 --> 37:33.468
but here we are.

37:35.035 --> 37:36.210
Don't try it, Uncle Frank.

37:38.299 --> 37:39.822
You brought this on yourself.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.654
Looks like you
weren't strong enough
for the tether to work.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.179
Get out of here.

37:49.223 --> 37:52.400
Go crawl back to your boss.
And why don't you tell Percival

37:52.444 --> 37:54.184
that the battle's on.

37:54.228 --> 37:56.186
I'm invulnerable again,

37:56.230 --> 37:57.449
and we're ready to fight.

38:10.810 --> 38:14.117
I can't believe
what you've done.

38:14.161 --> 38:15.467
The paint, the colors,

38:15.510 --> 38:17.730
it almost feels
like the real McCoy.

38:17.773 --> 38:21.168
Benjamin Moore
for the win, again.

38:21.211 --> 38:24.345
It was the definition
of a group effort, Grandpa.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.346
Speaking of...

38:26.652 --> 38:27.957
did your plan work?

38:28.001 --> 38:28.915
Like a charm.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.961
Pop's is still Pop's.

38:33.354 --> 38:36.183
A refuge for lost souls.

38:36.226 --> 38:38.968
And the final battle,
whenever it happens,

38:39.012 --> 38:42.015
will be witnessed
by the appropriate parties.

38:42.929 --> 38:45.540
The living and the dead.

38:52.504 --> 38:53.331
Hey.

38:55.811 --> 38:57.509
Uh,

38:57.552 --> 38:58.901
what's the occasion?

38:59.989 --> 39:04.385
I wanted to apologize, Fangs.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.604
You're right.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.738
I haven't had
enough faith in you.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.308
My...

39:14.352 --> 39:18.268
whole life,
I've been fiercely independent.

39:18.312 --> 39:22.142
Thinking I could take
on everything myself.

39:22.185 --> 39:24.362
But now I realized

39:24.405 --> 39:28.235
we need to be equal partners
in all things.

39:28.278 --> 39:31.804
So, that's why
I was thinking...

39:35.198 --> 39:36.983
maybe we should get married.

39:40.247 --> 39:41.074
Toni...

39:42.467 --> 39:44.120
where is all this coming from?

39:47.297 --> 39:49.517
I'm worried about
what you're telling me, Toni.

39:49.561 --> 39:52.390
Me, too, Janet.

39:52.433 --> 39:54.827
Lately, Fangs and I have been
disagreeing about everything.

39:54.870 --> 39:57.307
Toni, one of
the biggest advantages

39:57.351 --> 39:59.005
you and Fangs have over Kevin

39:59.048 --> 40:02.312
is that the court sees you
as a happy, stable couple.

40:02.356 --> 40:03.923
Going into these
custody hearings,

40:03.966 --> 40:07.796
you need to be stronger,
more united than ever.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.146
Otherwise, you could lose
that advantage.

40:10.190 --> 40:11.670
And possibly Baby Anthony.

40:15.630 --> 40:17.458
Where this
is coming from, Fangs,

40:17.502 --> 40:19.155
is that I heard you.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.114
I hear you.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.597
So what do you say?

40:28.251 --> 40:29.775
Will you marry me?

40:35.041 --> 40:36.738
I think we were wrong

40:36.782 --> 40:40.786
about the serial killer gene
being my blind spot.

40:40.829 --> 40:44.267
I saw an aura around my mom
clear as day.

40:45.181 --> 40:46.182
And she has the gene.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.927
Your powers are
a byproduct of trauma, Betty.

40:51.971 --> 40:55.888
Your most recent discoveries
about your mom are more trauma.

40:55.931 --> 40:58.281
This could be
a natural expansion
of your abilities,

40:58.325 --> 41:00.936
sensing everyone
who poses a danger,

41:00.980 --> 41:02.155
physical or emotional.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.292
She wasn't the only one, Drake.

41:11.599 --> 41:14.602
I saw another aura
that I hadn't previously.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.215
On someone else
who has the MAOA gene.

41:22.262 --> 41:23.829
<i>The scary part is...</i>

41:26.309 --> 41:29.182
<i>I don't know who this person</i> <i>
is a threat to.</i>

41:31.271 --> 41:32.577
<i>Herself?</i>

41:34.927 --> 41:37.407
<i>Anyone who comes close to her?</i>

41:38.844 --> 41:40.933
<i>Or even the people</i> <i>
that she loves?</i>
