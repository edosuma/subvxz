Subtitles by demonseye

02:30.743 --> 02:31.970
Yeah?

02:36.380 --> 02:37.707
Yeah, I got it.

03:26.315 --> 03:29.768
Take it easy, Lu.
You gotta have a little faith.

03:29.768 --> 03:31.696
Relax.
Have something to eat.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.680
There's some more stuff
in the fridge, if you like.

03:36.184 --> 03:40.133
- You want some coffee or something?
- No, I just want this to be over with.

03:51.930 --> 03:53.238
I'm gonna lie down.

03:53.238 --> 03:55.740
- Lu, you gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

04:02.749 --> 04:05.050
- Hi, baby.
- Hi.

04:05.991 --> 04:07.848
Thanks.
Come here, come here.

04:08.696 --> 04:10.009
Come over here.

04:10.862 --> 04:14.494
- Honey, you gotta take it easy.
- I shouldn't have done this, Michael.

04:14.494 --> 04:17.188
- This is insane.
- Come on, come on.

04:17.188 --> 04:19.913
Come on, look what it's done.
I mean, look where we are.

04:20.178 --> 04:22.879
Well, won't last forever.

04:23.206 --> 04:27.876
Yes, it will.
This is gonna last forever.

04:28.030 --> 04:32.540
- You don't know these people.
- Now, now, let's just get through the trial.

04:33.484 --> 04:37.366
Then we'll get the hell out of
the country, just you and me.

04:39.538 --> 04:44.565
- I love you.
- I love you too, kid.

04:59.350 --> 05:01.922
I had such a great time
at the party last night.

05:01.872 --> 05:03.845
They always get
the best caterers.

05:03.845 --> 05:07.003
I don't know where they find them.
That food was great.

05:07.977 --> 05:10.103
What do we have here?

05:16.354 --> 05:18.912
<i>- McNamara, you there?
- Yeah, we're here.</i>

05:18.912 --> 05:21.969
<i>We have a septic truck
right in front of the house.</i>

05:22.240 --> 05:26.142
- 3-5-2-M-S-R.
- Running the plate.

05:29.278 --> 05:30.673
"You dump it... We pump it."

05:30.673 --> 05:33.397
- Sounds like a government job.
- Yeah.

05:44.658 --> 05:46.396
<i>Okay, the license plate
checks out.</i>

05:46.396 --> 05:48.742
<i>We have
a scheduled pump for today.</i>

05:48.826 --> 05:51.925
Lucky us,
or should I say, lucky you?

05:51.925 --> 05:55.544
You may unfasten your safety belts
and rumba around the cabin.

06:01.117 --> 06:03.747
We have a pizza delivery
this time.

06:04.935 --> 06:06.936
Running the plate now.

06:16.457 --> 06:18.168
What the hell, you guys
didn't order pizza, did you?

06:18.168 --> 06:20.803
- Oh, right.
- No, it's 7 o'clock in the morning.

06:21.029 --> 06:23.303
- Oh, shi...
- We have a Code Red! Code Red!

06:43.548 --> 06:44.313
Ready? Now!

06:44.313 --> 06:46.902
- Freeze! Move!
- Turn around! Get down!

06:48.949 --> 06:50.666
I didn't do nothin'!
I swear!

06:53.724 --> 06:54.791
I swear
I didn't do nothin'!

06:54.791 --> 06:55.729
- Hey!
- Relax!

06:59.120 --> 07:00.924
- Well, is that wired?
- I don't know!

07:07.444 --> 07:09.924
Hey, this truck's
not pumpin' out, it's pumpin' in!

07:09.924 --> 07:12.413
- Lu, get outta the house!
- Lu, get out!

07:25.472 --> 07:27.786
Hey, go on and get
that truck outta there!

07:28.176 --> 07:29.732
Get that truck
outta here!

07:30.420 --> 07:33.589
Lu, get out!
Lu! Lu!

07:34.145 --> 07:37.109
- Out the back!
- This way! This way! You'll know why.

07:47.666 --> 07:50.262
Okay, get it outta here!
Get it out!

08:03.216 --> 08:04.723
This way! Go!

08:19.339 --> 08:21.371
Run, Lu, run!

08:24.003 --> 08:25.339
Lu, help!

08:26.122 --> 08:28.359
Lu! Lu!

08:31.988 --> 08:34.763
Oh, my God!
Michael!

09:23.241 --> 09:27.552
Unbelievable!
This is... unbelievable!

09:28.023 --> 09:31.886
The truck was filled with gasoline.
The guy must have had a remote.

09:32.185 --> 09:33.992
Well, he detonated
his truck.

09:35.295 --> 09:37.424
And once they found out
where the safe house was,

09:38.141 --> 09:40.186
it would have been easy
to find schedules.

09:41.826 --> 09:44.965
He probably intercepted the truck
sometime before the last stop.

09:44.965 --> 09:46.687
- We've uncovered another body.
- Where is it?

09:46.687 --> 09:48.715
Over there.
That makes number three.

09:57.643 --> 10:01.211
- Oh, is this Delano or not?
- No, I don't think so.

10:01.406 --> 10:03.267
This weapon's police issue.

10:07.261 --> 10:11.977
Our entire case against Costanzo
is based on Delano's testimony.

10:11.977 --> 10:15.016
So I would really like to know
if she is alive or dead

10:15.016 --> 10:17.727
before I call her
to the witness stand!

10:17.732 --> 10:22.386
I can't take this goombah into court
with a bunch of circumstantial crap!

10:22.386 --> 10:24.767
He'll walk, just like he
walked the last two times.

10:24.767 --> 10:28.516
Hello? This was your responsibility,
sir, and you blew it!

10:28.516 --> 10:31.190
- Don't you dare pin this on me!
- Don't talk back to me, sir!

10:31.190 --> 10:32.843
- Hey, listen!
- This whole operation was compromised!

10:34.414 --> 10:35.633
Back off!

10:35.633 --> 10:38.124
What you people don't seem
to be able to understand

10:38.124 --> 10:40.942
is that without
this witness, I have no case!

10:40.942 --> 10:44.100
Now, can anyone tell me
if she is dead?

10:45.531 --> 10:47.537
Sir, I don't think
she's one of the bodies.

10:48.630 --> 10:50.484
You think
she survived this?

10:51.305 --> 10:53.281
Well, I've looked at
all the bodies we found.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.313
None of them match
Delano's description.

10:58.990 --> 11:01.136
Are you telling me
that she's alive?

11:02.321 --> 11:06.268
Well, she's definitely not
one of the bodies we have.

11:09.134 --> 11:11.085
Then where the hell is she?

11:54.702 --> 11:57.653
- Hey.
- Loser.

12:00.066 --> 12:02.733
- I think it's him.
- Where?

12:03.616 --> 12:05.659
Long hair
over by the pickup.

12:06.833 --> 12:09.150
- What do you got?
- Hey.

12:10.407 --> 12:11.469
You sure?

12:11.469 --> 12:14.729
Son of a bitch
killed my friends. Cut me bad.

12:14.877 --> 12:18.321
- You think I'd forget?
- We got a positive ID.

12:18.681 --> 12:20.662
Told you not to bother me
unless it was important.

12:20.662 --> 12:24.521
- Hope you're wearin' sun block.
- I'm a construction worker. I need rays.

12:24.521 --> 12:25.761
<i>He's coming
in your direction.</i>

12:25.761 --> 12:28.734
<i>Fatigues, Rayban sun glasses,
long hair.</i>

12:28.962 --> 12:32.388
- Whoo! What have we got here?
- Hey, you jerk!

12:32.388 --> 12:34.798
I think we should arrest him
for what he's wearing.

12:36.193 --> 12:39.414
Yeah, he looks like he's on page 26
of Madonna's sex book.

12:39.414 --> 12:40.707
<i>I got 'im.</i>

12:44.520 --> 12:46.434
Think it's safe to assume
he's armed and dangerous?

12:46.434 --> 12:48.945
- Wanna yell "Freeze"?
- Uh, no, I yelled "Freeze" last time.

12:50.018 --> 12:51.630
<i>- Go ahead, it makes you feel better.
- No, no, no.</i>

12:51.630 --> 12:54.812
Hey, stay right here.
No, no, you get hurt, it's my ass.

13:12.593 --> 13:15.258
Whoa... whoa! Hold it!

13:27.652 --> 13:28.668
Whoops.

13:28.668 --> 13:31.527
Yes! Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

13:31.527 --> 13:33.805
What are you lookin' at?
Go after 'im!

13:35.998 --> 13:38.870
No, I've seen this one before.
You go there. I'll take the back.

13:51.924 --> 13:53.607
- He's goin' upstairs!
- Got it!

13:58.760 --> 14:00.228
Freeze! Oh!

14:02.084 --> 14:06.091
Uh, just a hunch, but I don't think
this guy's gonna go in peacefully.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.380
Freeze!

14:11.694 --> 14:12.899
He's not freezing!

14:12.899 --> 14:16.171
- Try "Stop or I'll shoot!"
- Stop or I'll shoot!

14:18.512 --> 14:20.000
No! Anything else?

14:20.000 --> 14:21.751
Did you say
"Simon says"?

14:23.721 --> 14:25.233
Watch a pro.

14:26.505 --> 14:29.433
- Police! You're under arrest!
- Whoa!

14:44.411 --> 14:45.565
Chris!

14:51.071 --> 14:52.187
Yuck!

14:54.983 --> 14:56.760
So that's how
a pro does it, huh?

15:08.280 --> 15:09.503
Die.

15:13.040 --> 15:16.955
Hey, wait! Wait! Whoa, whoa!
Seattle P.D., stop that truck!

15:27.305 --> 15:30.672
Hey! Seattle P.D.!
Stop!

15:30.672 --> 15:32.381
Stop the truck!

15:35.718 --> 15:38.177
- Stop the truck.
- What?

15:38.606 --> 15:40.510
My partner's in the back.

16:03.333 --> 16:05.108
Ta-daaaa!

16:09.898 --> 16:10.930
I'm hit!

16:12.316 --> 16:14.683
- Let's get outta here!
- Come on. Come on.

16:15.421 --> 16:17.486
Son of a bitch
killed my friend.

16:18.759 --> 16:19.977
Drop it!

16:28.456 --> 16:29.718
Mm-hmm?

16:30.425 --> 16:33.511
Shi... Oh, no.

16:41.025 --> 16:42.271
Yeah, what do you want?

16:42.271 --> 16:44.539
- Gina Garrett for the captain.
- Okay.

16:45.346 --> 16:46.902
Gina Garrett for you.

16:50.853 --> 16:52.039
Hey, you two!

16:52.039 --> 16:55.021
Stinky, Reimers!
Captain's havin' a hemorrhoid.

16:55.021 --> 16:58.456
Wants your butts
in his office A.S.A.P.

16:58.466 --> 17:01.269
- I'm sorry, Gina Garrett, was it?
- Gina Garrett, yes.

17:03.052 --> 17:04.189
In!

17:04.750 --> 17:06.762
All right, gimme a minute.
I'll get back to you.

17:09.890 --> 17:11.670
Oh, let me guess.

17:11.704 --> 17:15.182
Sanitation and construction.
Two of my favorites... Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

17:15.182 --> 17:18.124
Don't you dare sit in
those chairs. Either of you.

17:18.124 --> 17:20.691
Detective Lecce, is this the weapon
involved in the assault?

17:20.691 --> 17:22.391
- Yes, sir, captain, sir.
- And do we know whose weapon it is?

17:22.391 --> 17:26.561
- Yes, sir, captain, sir, it's mine, sir.
- Okay. Let's get some facts straight.

17:26.742 --> 17:30.180
Winston and I don't want Internal
Affairs pointing a finger at us,

17:30.180 --> 17:32.717
saying that we didn't
do our job right.

17:32.717 --> 17:34.372
Uhh... The gun fell out
of my hand

17:34.372 --> 17:36.227
because I happened
to be falling out of a window.

17:36.475 --> 17:38.843
Witness picked it up,
shot the suspect. Sue me.

17:38.843 --> 17:42.992
Okay. Since this is now classified
as an officer-involved shooting,

17:43.193 --> 17:46.203
you two won't mind
a quick visit with the D.A.'s office.

17:46.203 --> 17:46.951
- What?
- What?!

17:46.951 --> 17:49.371
- The guy was resisting arrest!
- It took the two of us to hold him down!

17:49.371 --> 17:50.156
- He can't file charges against me!
- Really?

17:50.156 --> 17:54.958
- The gun was falling out of my hand!
- Hey! Hey!

17:55.672 --> 17:58.810
- Who said anything about filing charges?
- But you said the D.A.'s office!

17:58.810 --> 18:00.051
No, no, no, no.
I didn't say anything.

18:00.051 --> 18:03.524
You two are temporarily reassigned
to the D.A.'s office

18:03.524 --> 18:05.368
and they'd like
to stop by and tell you why.

18:05.368 --> 18:06.421
Do we get a choice?

18:06.602 --> 18:10.561
Choice?
A handcuffed suspect?

18:13.386 --> 18:17.233
- Good afternoon.
- Phillip. Gentlemen.

18:17.233 --> 18:20.089
Gentlemen, this is Assistant
District Attorney Gina Garrett.

18:20.089 --> 18:22.694
This is detective Chris Lecce
and detective Bill Reimers.

18:22.706 --> 18:24.608
Oh, I'm really sorry about that.
I didn't mean to...

18:24.608 --> 18:27.299
Aw, don't use that.
That's my scarf!

18:27.301 --> 18:29.579
- I got some spaghetti all over...
- That's fine, everything's fine.

18:30.556 --> 18:33.684
Gentlemen, this assignment's
confidential. Don't discuss it.

18:34.055 --> 18:37.400
Two days ago the Las Vegas D.A.
and the U.S. Department of Justice

18:37.400 --> 18:39.973
asked us to help find a witness
who was gonna testify

18:39.973 --> 18:42.249
against the head
of a Chicago crime family.

18:42.562 --> 18:44.629
Luella Delano was the witness.

18:44.629 --> 18:48.367
Justice had her under protective custody
until someone blew up the safe house,

18:48.367 --> 18:52.436
- killing several agents.
- How many are several?

18:52.484 --> 18:55.704
Three.
Somehow she got away.

18:55.906 --> 18:58.409
She's made no attempt to contact
the Department of Justice

18:58.409 --> 19:00.376
or the Las Vegas D.A.
since then.

19:00.376 --> 19:02.983
- What, no, uh, postcard?
- No.

19:03.117 --> 19:05.330
Trial begins next week.
The Feds are all worked up.

19:05.330 --> 19:08.074
Apparently, without Delano
the government has no case.

19:08.074 --> 19:12.244
So, all leads are being followed,
including one which leads here.

19:12.244 --> 19:14.882
Phone call Delano made
to a number here in Seattle

19:14.882 --> 19:17.067
belonging to
a Brian and Pam O'Hara.

19:17.067 --> 19:19.848
- She may be lookin' to lay low with them.
- Anybody check the O'Haras?

19:19.848 --> 19:22.398
They left for their vacation home
on Bainbridge Island two days ago,

19:22.398 --> 19:25.228
which makes putting them
under surveillance a little tricky.

19:25.534 --> 19:27.675
- Stakeout.
- We heard you're good at it.

19:27.675 --> 19:29.561
We cannot rotate
surveillance teams.

19:29.561 --> 19:31.597
- Oh, no.
- You'll be on it round the clock.

19:31.901 --> 19:34.940
I have managed to secure
the house next to the O'Haras.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.180
It belongs
to judge Hoberman.

19:37.504 --> 19:40.026
- Maximum Dave?
- And I've had to promise on my career

19:40.026 --> 19:41.534
that nothing would happen
to his house,

19:41.534 --> 19:44.766
so, gentlemen, nothing
had better happen to his house.

19:44.766 --> 19:46.878
- So no wipin' your boogers on the sofa.
- Don't say boogers!

19:46.878 --> 19:48.685
- It's a habit you have to break.
- What's the matter...

19:48.685 --> 19:52.970
Your cover is you're renting the
judge's house for a month of vacation.

19:52.970 --> 19:54.655
As what,
friends or lovers?

19:56.103 --> 19:59.404
We think you'll be able
to pass for father and son.

20:02.448 --> 20:03.363
What, are you kidding me?

20:03.363 --> 20:05.081
- Mmm-mmm.
- Dad?

20:05.368 --> 20:06.478
- No way!
- Papa!

20:06.478 --> 20:08.092
All right,
just stop it right now.

20:08.092 --> 20:11.352
- And I'll be going with you.
- Really? As what? My granddaughter?

20:11.352 --> 20:13.930
- No, your wife.
- My wife?!

20:13.930 --> 20:16.749
- Your second wife actually.
- Look, boss, this is not an assignment...

20:16.749 --> 20:19.160
Detective! I'm the boss.

20:19.637 --> 20:23.198
- You are the...
- Yes, detective, I am the boss.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.668
Okay, this is a joke,
right?

20:40.363 --> 20:42.650
Okiedoke.
I'll see you later.

20:42.650 --> 20:45.703
- Uh, daddy?
- Uh, don't start with that crap.

20:45.968 --> 20:49.396
- I'm just practising.
- Oh-ho-ho, practise your prayers, pal.

20:49.396 --> 20:51.677
Come on, come on.
Just try calling me "son" just once.

20:51.677 --> 20:53.779
- Oh, you're really getting off on this one.
- Hello, son.

20:53.779 --> 20:55.794
The dad thing. The thing
with the dad and the son thing.

20:55.794 --> 20:57.858
This is a big-big chuckle
for you, right?

20:57.869 --> 21:02.005
- We have to be able to talk.
- Eat me. How's that?

21:02.400 --> 21:04.650
Does Maria let you
talk to her like that?

21:05.343 --> 21:07.956
I'm my own man.
When you're all grown up,

21:07.956 --> 21:09.731
you'll understand
what that means.

21:13.659 --> 21:14.592
- Hey, Ray.
- Chris.

21:14.592 --> 21:15.372
Whatcha doin'?

21:15.683 --> 21:18.951
Uh, helpin' my sister out.
Sorry, nothin' personal.

21:21.246 --> 21:23.559
"Nothing personal"?

21:26.333 --> 21:27.544
Maria!

21:29.056 --> 21:32.002
- Get out!
- What the hell is goin' on here?

21:32.002 --> 21:34.686
- I said get out.
- I know what you said.

21:34.686 --> 21:36.847
Then do it
and take your stuff!

21:37.654 --> 21:39.849
Maria, talk to me.

21:40.661 --> 21:41.986
Maria.

21:43.986 --> 21:46.373
- Are you throwing me out?
- Yes!

21:46.844 --> 21:49.852
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Nothing your leaving won't cure.

21:49.852 --> 21:51.434
Did I miss
a couple of pages?

21:51.830 --> 21:54.359
Exactly what is it that
I'm supposed to have done?

21:54.394 --> 21:55.295
You came home.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.802
I always come home.

21:56.802 --> 21:58.689
It's what I do
before I go back to work.

21:58.732 --> 22:01.872
Well, I am saving you
a trip.

22:01.872 --> 22:03.786
Uh, could we... could we go back
a couple of steps?

22:03.786 --> 22:06.629
You know, not that many either.
Just-just-just-just like last night.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.549
Remember?
I came home, we had dinner,

22:09.549 --> 22:11.483
we made love,
we went to sleep.

22:11.518 --> 22:13.364
In the morning, I got up
and went to work.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.532
Now-now, uh,
did I miss somethin'?

22:18.833 --> 22:23.601
I'm leaving.
When I come back, I want you gone.

22:23.601 --> 22:25.000
No, not until
you tell me why.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.672
Because I'm tired of wanting
something I'm not gonna get.

22:27.791 --> 22:30.037
- You're happy. I'm not.
- Oh, Maria, we have been over this.

22:30.037 --> 22:33.115
Don't bother, I don't want
to hear the reasons anymore.

22:33.115 --> 22:35.269
Marriage doesn't work
in my family. Now just listen to me.

22:35.269 --> 22:37.541
My parents, my sisters,
my brothers, my aunts,

22:37.541 --> 22:40.764
everybody got divor... If we got
married, that would be the end of this.

22:40.764 --> 22:42.540
What do you think
this is?

22:43.461 --> 22:46.531
Maria. Maria, we love each other.
We're living together.

22:46.531 --> 22:46.898
Just go!

22:46.898 --> 22:49.963
Why do you wanna ruin the whole thing
for a goddamn piece of paper?

22:50.042 --> 22:52.272
Get out of my way,
you asshole!

22:52.272 --> 22:55.641
Maria, I am not leaving.
Do you hear me? I am not leaving!

22:55.641 --> 22:58.086
I'm willing to work this out.
I'm not leaving.

22:58.086 --> 23:01.349
Okay, Chris.
You're right. You stay.

23:23.317 --> 23:26.098
- What are you doing?
- Calling the police.

23:26.098 --> 23:29.225
- Ha-ha-ha! Very funny.
- McGuire, Maria.

23:29.276 --> 23:31.318
M-c-G-u-i-r-e.

23:31.318 --> 23:34.199
Yes, I'd like to report
a domestic disturbance.

23:34.199 --> 23:36.686
That's right, isn't it?
And I'd hate to be wrong

23:36.686 --> 23:38.969
after living with a cop
for six years.

23:39.181 --> 23:43.249
Yes, a domestic disturbance.
I'm being held against my will.

23:47.503 --> 23:51.659
All right. All right!
I'll marry you!

24:02.660 --> 24:05.154
Life is too short.

24:12.821 --> 24:16.322
Okay. I don't have much time,
so just listen.

24:16.322 --> 24:20.422
- They don't think Delano's dead.
- Are you sure?

24:20.422 --> 24:23.704
<i>- Yes, I'm sure.
- Well, then, where the hell is she?</i>

24:23.704 --> 24:28.680
No one knows.
She hasn't contacted anybody.

24:29.025 --> 24:33.181
Look, chances are, if they find her,
it won't be till after the trial anyway.

24:33.227 --> 24:37.646
<i>- There's no guarantee.
- You're the guarantee, Hassrick.</i>

24:37.646 --> 24:42.276
- Do you understand me?
- It is not my fault. It's your man.

24:42.276 --> 24:46.647
Look, you just find her
and you call me. Got it?

24:46.647 --> 24:49.261
Fine. I will. If I find out.

25:01.535 --> 25:05.914
Hey, guys. Sit tight.
I'll be with you in a second.

25:06.551 --> 25:08.632
So, did she tell you why
or was it just...

25:09.138 --> 25:11.085
- You know.
- Marriage.

25:11.085 --> 25:13.822
- Mmm.
- Mmm, commitment thing.

25:14.533 --> 25:16.708
- So what are you afraid of?
- Advice.

25:19.764 --> 25:23.812
Okay, guys, here it goes.
Unleaded fuel only.

25:23.812 --> 25:28.299
Check the oil when you fill it up
and don't try and use the car phone

25:28.299 --> 25:31.068
because...
we disconnected it.

25:31.205 --> 25:32.907
And I know you guys
might feel a little tempted

25:32.907 --> 25:35.178
to have some fun
with that fuckin'... Hey!

25:35.232 --> 25:38.146
Chill! Keep your yang
in your pants.

25:38.146 --> 25:41.375
This vehicle goes on sale
at the auction at the end of next week.

25:41.375 --> 25:46.301
The guys upstairs expressly asked me
to ask you two... not to mess it up.

25:46.301 --> 25:48.690
You got that? Okay.

25:48.822 --> 25:51.992
- All right, guys, who gets the keys?
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

25:54.460 --> 25:59.189
I'm the dad! This is a family car.
You'll have to beg.

26:15.675 --> 26:18.938
- Hey!
- Yee-ha!

26:21.536 --> 26:22.633
Hey!

26:23.359 --> 26:25.412
Ave...

26:28.845 --> 26:30.621
So, what do you think?
Left or right?

26:35.521 --> 26:38.852
Well... maybe
this won't be so bad.

26:39.252 --> 26:41.284
We've been in worse situations
than this before, right?

26:41.284 --> 26:43.132
Remember all that stuff
with Droolin' Harry?

26:43.132 --> 26:45.781
I told you never to mention
Droolin' Harry again.

26:47.016 --> 26:50.526
This is it.
What clown painted this place?

26:55.022 --> 26:59.495
Archie, shut up! I could use
some help up here, please.

27:00.480 --> 27:02.187
Help your mother.

27:04.926 --> 27:08.480
Good boy, yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

27:08.690 --> 27:12.781
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you nuts? Four bags?

27:12.781 --> 27:14.580
Oh, please, don't give me
that man thing.

27:14.580 --> 27:15.332
No, no, no. No.

27:15.332 --> 27:17.538
This is not a man thing.
This is a woman thing.

27:17.538 --> 27:18.974
Really?
Well, this is what I'm takin'.

27:18.974 --> 27:22.110
Fine, take the bags!
We're stayin' here.

27:22.110 --> 27:25.648
Isn't this great? Our first fight.
Feel like a family already.

27:25.648 --> 27:29.533
Listen, detective.
We're supposed to be well-to-do.

27:29.533 --> 27:32.534
I cannot do well-to-do
with one change of clothes.

27:32.534 --> 27:35.811
So this is what I'm taking.
Open the trunk.

27:39.270 --> 27:41.563
Well, we could leave the bugging
equipment and the recorder.

27:41.563 --> 27:45.637
I suppose. Course, we could, uh,
write down what they say, I think.

27:45.910 --> 27:48.064
Should have taken that shorthand
course. What about the cameras?

27:48.064 --> 27:48.995
- Uh, leave 'em.
- Yeah.

27:48.995 --> 27:50.048
You can draw pretty well.

27:50.048 --> 27:51.304
Just need to pick up
some paper

27:51.304 --> 27:53.394
and some crayons,
you know, the big thick ones.

27:53.394 --> 27:54.581
Don't leave the pictures
on the refrigerator...

27:54.581 --> 27:58.157
All right. All right. All right.

28:00.463 --> 28:04.533
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

28:04.949 --> 28:07.307
You cannot be paper
every time.

28:07.307 --> 28:09.461
There are no rules
in paper, rock, scissors.

28:09.461 --> 28:10.475
Yes, there are.

28:10.475 --> 28:11.991
- No, there are not.
- Yes, there are.

28:11.991 --> 28:12.952
No, they're not.

28:14.817 --> 28:17.806
- Yes, there are.
- Oh, God, don't be so childish.

28:23.616 --> 28:24.383
Good boy, sit!

28:24.383 --> 28:26.717
Uh... I hope
you're taking him for a walk.

28:26.912 --> 28:28.272
He's comin' with us.

28:28.307 --> 28:29.860
- Not a chance.
- No way.

28:29.860 --> 28:32.208
- What's the problem?
- We're on a job.

28:32.208 --> 28:34.514
Oh, yeah? And what, are you afraid
he's gonna tell the neighbors?

28:34.514 --> 28:37.566
- Put him in a kennel.
- I have never put him in a kennel

28:37.566 --> 28:40.779
and I'm not about to start now.
He is very well trained.

28:40.779 --> 28:42.935
He'll simply lie by the fire,
I'll take him for walks...

28:42.935 --> 28:44.678
It doesn't get much
more complicated than that.

28:45.033 --> 28:46.707
Really.
We're a family, gentlemen.

28:46.742 --> 28:48.940
- Families have dogs.
- Not this family.

28:48.940 --> 28:51.050
If he doesn't go,
I don't go.

28:59.934 --> 29:01.991
Archie! Up!

29:06.599 --> 29:08.342
Don't make
any sudden movements.

29:08.342 --> 29:10.708
He's trained.
He's not that well trained.

29:38.600 --> 29:40.204
So what do you think,
I should marry 'er?

29:40.436 --> 29:42.641
It's only a stakeout, Chris.
It'll be over in a couple o' days.

29:42.641 --> 29:44.886
Maria!
I'm talking about Maria.

29:45.041 --> 29:47.588
If you're asking me, I think
you should have married her six years ago.

29:47.588 --> 29:50.569
- Hmm, I was too young.
- How about now?

29:51.048 --> 29:53.781
- I'm-I'm-I'm too old!
- Maybe you're too late.

29:53.781 --> 29:55.243
Did you ever think that
the reason she dumped you

29:55.243 --> 29:57.918
was maybe because
she's seein' another guy?

29:58.746 --> 30:00.816
If she was seein'
somebody else, I'd know.

30:01.213 --> 30:04.251
- Maybe!
- No maybe. I would know, all right?

30:04.342 --> 30:07.275
If she was seein'
somebody else, I'd know.

30:07.834 --> 30:11.841
Yeah, you're right. Beautiful girl
like her dumps you for a younger guy...

30:11.841 --> 30:13.172
That could never happen.

30:14.318 --> 30:17.679
Look at me, I've been married for
eight years. I've two wonderful kids,

30:17.679 --> 30:21.615
I'm happy, I'm still in love and not
a grey hair on my head. Now look at you.

30:21.615 --> 30:23.757
- Have I done something to offend you?
- Do you love her?

30:23.757 --> 30:27.137
- Yes! I love her.
- Then marry her! Commit to her.

30:27.137 --> 30:29.441
You're not gonna find
a better woman than Maria.

30:31.593 --> 30:33.275
Looks like
our time is up.

30:33.602 --> 30:36.923
- How much do I owe you?
- Oh, gee, this stuff don't come cheap.

30:36.923 --> 30:39.638
- Two, three bucks?
- Three. Thank you.

30:39.873 --> 30:43.450
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.

30:44.063 --> 30:46.551
Listen, I know that you feel
this assignment is beneath you.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.622
Perhaps it's because I'm a woman,
maybe it's because I'm not a cop.

30:49.622 --> 30:50.629
It doesn't really matter.

30:50.629 --> 30:53.386
The fact is, I'm really not
as bad as you think I am.

30:53.386 --> 30:56.795
And I'm hoping that you're not
as bad as I think you are.

30:56.795 --> 30:57.384
- Look.
- He is.

30:57.384 --> 31:00.318
You just do what you do
and we'll do what we do. Okay?

31:00.318 --> 31:02.164
It really doesn't get
any more complicated than that.

31:02.164 --> 31:04.489
That's fine with me.
I've prepared our backgrounds

31:04.489 --> 31:06.550
in case we come into contact
with our neighbors.

31:06.550 --> 31:09.763
We need to have a cohesive story.
I've tried to keep it simple.

31:10.088 --> 31:12.977
Chris... What's this word?

31:14.160 --> 31:15.808
- "The."
- Oh, yeah.

31:15.808 --> 31:20.150
There is one more thing. I think
that Bill should shave his moustache.

31:22.245 --> 31:23.569
Excuse me?

31:23.569 --> 31:24.077
Your moustache.

31:24.077 --> 31:25.225
It would make you
look a lot younger

31:25.269 --> 31:27.054
and you are supposed
to be Chris' son.

31:27.054 --> 31:27.647
Forget it!

31:27.750 --> 31:29.486
I really think
it would be more convincing.

31:29.521 --> 31:31.170
I don't think you understand
the relationship

31:31.170 --> 31:32.668
a man has
with his facial hair.

31:32.668 --> 31:35.577
Oh, please! I am not asking you
to cut off your penis.

31:35.577 --> 31:38.086
- Well, maybe you'd like to try!
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

31:38.086 --> 31:42.507
I have had this moustache for 13 years!
How long have you had yours?

31:47.482 --> 31:50.313
Man's relationship
with his facial hair, eh?

32:14.824 --> 32:16.073
How's it goin'?

32:17.217 --> 32:19.667
I'm not talkin' to you.
You took her side.

32:19.824 --> 32:22.526
This is the second marriage
for you and the first for me, Chris.

32:23.177 --> 32:25.476
- What happened to my first wife?
- Your first wife is dead.

32:25.476 --> 32:28.687
- Hmm, great.
- You think this is stupid, don't you?

32:29.596 --> 32:31.964
You have any idea
what's really goin' on here?

32:32.335 --> 32:36.174
You know what a stakeout is all about?
You sit, you listen, you watch.

32:36.465 --> 32:39.418
That's it.
You don't participate.

32:39.673 --> 32:41.913
You don't go over and, uh,
borrow a cup of sugar

32:41.913 --> 32:43.785
and you don't, uh,
bake them cookies.

32:43.785 --> 32:44.947
I think that about covers it.

32:44.947 --> 32:46.445
You know, Bill,
you look a lot younger.

32:46.445 --> 32:48.219
I look 12 years old!

33:05.400 --> 33:08.517
- It's so beautiful.
- That one's ours.

33:11.076 --> 33:12.649
Not bad, pop.

33:21.466 --> 33:22.958
Archie, stay.

33:25.342 --> 33:26.586
Thank you, Bill.

33:40.054 --> 33:43.731
- You are unbelievable.
- I'm an innocent guy.

33:45.950 --> 33:47.948
You want me to carry you
across the threshold?

33:47.948 --> 33:51.413
No, we've been married
for five years. The thrill is gone.

33:59.134 --> 34:01.065
Look at that view.

34:03.435 --> 34:04.879
Oh, it's gorgeous.

34:04.879 --> 34:08.610
Oh, look at these antiques.
My God, it must be worth a fortune!

34:08.610 --> 34:10.516
Oh, I wanna be a judge!

34:12.819 --> 34:18.083
Hey! It's Stickley!
Stickley's my favorite.

34:18.835 --> 34:21.813
Stickley's our favorite!

34:25.248 --> 34:27.553
This is fine-quality furniture,
gentlemen.

34:27.553 --> 34:30.337
Could you please be careful
with your fingers there?

34:56.974 --> 34:59.105
- Pretty good.
- Better here.

34:59.105 --> 35:01.043
See everybody
comin' and goin'.

35:07.998 --> 35:09.895
Looks good to me.

35:22.250 --> 35:25.189
Archie?
Oh, no. Archie, boy!

35:26.359 --> 35:27.554
Archie!

35:27.881 --> 35:31.604
Oh, Lord.
Oh, no, Archie! Archie!

35:31.709 --> 35:33.539
No, boy! Archie!

35:33.539 --> 35:37.331
- Mommy said "No". Archie!
- Oh, stop, it's gone.

35:37.331 --> 35:40.221
- Will you forget about it?
- I miss it! Okay?

35:43.724 --> 35:47.015
He's headin' next door!
Archie!

35:47.432 --> 35:49.722
Archie! No, Archie!

35:51.866 --> 35:53.190
No! Archie!

35:54.118 --> 35:56.082
No!
Come back here, Archie!

35:58.119 --> 36:01.108
Archie!
No, Archie!

36:02.726 --> 36:05.926
Wait for mommy!
Archie!

36:06.727 --> 36:08.531
Shoot the dog!

36:28.263 --> 36:32.209
No! Bad dog, Archie!
No! Mommy said "No"!

36:33.595 --> 36:35.076
- Hi, is everything all right?
- Hi!

36:35.076 --> 36:40.164
Oh, yes! Everything's fine.
My dog's not usually like this, uh.

36:40.164 --> 36:43.204
It's our dog, actually.
He's... quite friendly.

36:43.394 --> 36:46.660
I think, yeah, your cat's fine.
Just a little bit scared.

36:46.660 --> 36:48.479
Oh, it's no problem.
It's not even our cat.

36:48.479 --> 36:50.272
It belongs to the Outlingers
down the road.

36:50.272 --> 36:51.793
Every dog in the neighborhood
chases it.

36:51.793 --> 36:52.434
Don't worry about it.

36:52.434 --> 36:54.270
Really, I'm sorry still
about the garden.

36:54.270 --> 36:56.896
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
don't worry about it,

36:56.896 --> 36:58.085
as long as
everyone is all right.

36:58.085 --> 36:59.883
- It's not gonna happen again.
- It's all right.

36:59.883 --> 37:00.984
Are you staying
around here?

37:00.984 --> 37:04.039
Yes, we've rented the house next door
for a couple of weeks.

37:04.039 --> 37:04.588
Great!

37:04.588 --> 37:06.102
Oh, that's great.
You know Judge Hoberman.

37:06.242 --> 37:06.911
Maximum Dave.

37:06.911 --> 37:11.001
Not, not well, not. We just...
we met him... couple of times.

37:11.001 --> 37:13.480
Well, I'm Pam O'Hara.
This is my husband, Brian.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.877
- Hi! Hi!
- Great, I'm Gina. This is my husband...

37:17.493 --> 37:21.898
Chris! Chris. It's an unusual name.
Glad to meet you.

37:22.272 --> 37:26.489
Hi, Chris' son, Bill.
Uh, I'm his son from his first marriage.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.885
My, uh, mom's dead.

37:31.765 --> 37:33.723
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

37:33.988 --> 37:36.445
Well, I-I guess we'll be seeing
a lot more of you then.

37:36.445 --> 37:39.150
Yes! That would be lovely.
We'd like that, wouldn't we?

37:39.150 --> 37:41.527
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
We'll have drinks'n...

37:41.688 --> 37:43.091
dinner maybe.

37:43.890 --> 37:46.759
Maybe we'll even have a party.
You know, what the hell?

37:46.759 --> 37:48.224
- Sure.
- That'll be great.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.837
- Really like that, wouldn't you, honey?
- Yes, that would be lovely.

37:50.837 --> 37:53.631
Well, we're gonna leave you...
leave you guys alone here, uh...

37:54.088 --> 37:56.670
Nice to meet you and, uh,
we're gonna go home.

37:56.670 --> 37:57.347
Good bye.

37:57.347 --> 37:59.189
- So long.
- Good bye. See ya. Bye-bye.

37:59.189 --> 38:02.218
- Come on, Archie.
- That's a... nice moustache.

38:02.218 --> 38:03.065
You had that long?

38:03.065 --> 38:06.402
Oh, thanks for asking. A long time.
Most of my life, really. Thanks for askin'.

38:06.402 --> 38:09.154
- You had that... for a while.
- Billy, please. Honey.

38:11.096 --> 38:13.757
Okay, so, uh, we've been
here, what, five minutes?

38:13.757 --> 38:15.999
I usually wait two or three days
before I introduce myself

38:15.999 --> 38:17.276
to the people
that I'm staking out.

38:17.276 --> 38:19.508
I'm sorry, okay?
It will not happen again.

38:19.508 --> 38:23.144
I will keep him in the house and
I'm sorry about blanking on your name.

38:23.144 --> 38:27.380
Blanking on my name. Hello, my name
is Gina. This is my husband, duh!

38:27.380 --> 38:28.962
- You know, that's really not nice.
- Mom, dad!

38:28.962 --> 38:29.644
You know that?

38:29.644 --> 38:30.753
Please don't fight
in front of me.

38:30.753 --> 38:32.853
- It's very upsetting.
- What, you think this is funny?

38:32.853 --> 38:35.293
It's not my dog.
This assignment gets blown,

38:35.293 --> 38:37.794
it's not my butt,
it's Archie's butt.

38:39.656 --> 38:40.973
Good point.

38:41.043 --> 38:42.773
Hello, this is Chris.
Is Mari...

38:43.973 --> 38:47.697
Hola, es Chris.
E-es Maria en casa?

38:48.907 --> 38:53.515
No. Well, would you tell...
Diga Maria se llama?

38:53.515 --> 38:56.686
Si. Si. No, no. No, no.
Momento.

38:56.686 --> 39:00.699
Um, dos, uh, ceros,
uh, seis,

39:01.180 --> 39:03.371
uh, siete, uh...

39:03.371 --> 39:05.353
Uno, dos, tres, quatro,
cinqo, seis, siete...

39:05.353 --> 39:06.800
- Ocho.
- Ocho. Okay.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.504
Dos, cero, seis, no, no, no, no, no,
dos, cero, seis...

39:09.504 --> 39:13.616
- Shut up!
- Dos, cero, seis...

39:13.616 --> 39:18.569
Dos, cero, seis,
siete, ocho, ocho. Gracias.

39:20.116 --> 39:24.989
Senor. Pendejo.
Cuidado.

39:25.302 --> 39:27.922
- So what'd she say?
- She wasn't home.

39:28.656 --> 39:32.133
- Yeah? Try work?
- She wasn't there either.

39:32.133 --> 39:34.782
- Well, she's probably just out.
- Yeah? Where?

39:34.919 --> 39:36.102
Oh, shopping or something.

39:36.102 --> 39:37.876
- How do I know?
- She's with another guy.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.337
- Now, how do you know that?
- You told me.

39:40.438 --> 39:42.785
- Hello, I was kidding.
- I'm gonna find out.

39:42.785 --> 39:43.883
Oh, wait a minute.

39:43.883 --> 39:47.827
Wait for mommy, honey.
Good boy.

39:47.827 --> 39:49.765
- You're acting like a madman.
- I'll be back.

39:49.765 --> 39:51.208
Look, we are on a job.

39:51.208 --> 39:52.803
I'm just gonna ask her
if she's seeing somebody, that's all.

39:52.803 --> 39:54.758
I am telling you
as a friend, don't do this.

39:54.758 --> 39:57.400
And I'm-a tell you
as a friend, don't do this.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.523
No-no! No!

40:02.123 --> 40:04.715
Wait, I need that car!
Wait a second!

40:04.715 --> 40:08.190
Wait, wait! Wait! Wait!

40:20.322 --> 40:21.911
Tell me about it later?

40:25.876 --> 40:28.138
Sir, excuse me.

40:35.146 --> 40:36.633
Tony, where you goin'?

40:37.152 --> 40:39.723
They, uh, couldn't
identify her body.

40:40.186 --> 40:41.233
What are you saying?

40:41.233 --> 40:42.867
Well, I'm saying,
without confirmation

40:42.867 --> 40:44.108
we're a little nervous.

40:44.755 --> 40:47.184
- You want me to get confirmation?
- What we want is

40:47.184 --> 40:50.876
reassurance that the job
you were paid for... was done.

40:50.876 --> 40:53.395
- You know she's alive?
- We don't know she isn't.

40:53.395 --> 40:56.371
- And you know the situation that puts us in.
- I'm gonna say it again.

40:56.371 --> 40:59.710
What... what are you saying?
Do you want the money back? What?

40:59.710 --> 41:05.874
Tony, Tony, you misunderstand me.
Money is not the issue here. Trust is.

41:05.932 --> 41:09.478
That's why we came to you with
this very important piece of business.

41:09.568 --> 41:12.007
And, Tony,
we have every confidence

41:12.347 --> 41:14.980
that you'll do the job
that was entrusted to you.

41:16.538 --> 41:17.694
Okay?

41:23.420 --> 41:26.718
- Oh, makin' a little dinner?
- Yes, I am. Love cooking.

41:26.718 --> 41:29.467
- Mmm, looks good.
- Thank you very much.

41:31.229 --> 41:34.226
- It's late. Maria should be home by now.
- Maybe.

41:34.226 --> 41:37.185
- Why don't you try callin' her again?
- Aww, it's too late.

41:37.185 --> 41:40.550
She's probably married by now.
I have to get 'er a gift.

41:40.550 --> 41:43.164
Did you know she asked me
to be her maid of honor?

41:46.558 --> 41:50.144
So... when are we gonna
invite them over for drinks?

41:52.487 --> 41:55.130
- Ah, Bill?
- Yes, Chris?

41:55.130 --> 41:58.237
Did I just hear you suggest that
we invite the neighbors over for drinks,

41:59.113 --> 42:01.437
the very people that
we're here to stake out?

42:01.579 --> 42:03.629
Why, no, Chris.
I would never do such a thing.

42:03.629 --> 42:05.094
Good to know, Bill!

42:05.094 --> 42:09.300
The reason that I thought is because
it's simply a more expedient way

42:09.300 --> 42:10.118
of finding out
whether or not

42:10.118 --> 42:11.184
they've heard anything
about Delano.

42:11.184 --> 42:13.960
And how do you expect us
to go about doing that? I know!

42:13.960 --> 42:15.459
Maybe we could
just ask them

42:15.459 --> 42:17.722
if they have any friends
in... protective custody.

42:17.823 --> 42:19.451
Well, you know,
it was not my idea.

42:19.451 --> 42:21.291
You happen to be the one
who invited them over.

42:21.959 --> 42:24.333
- I did not!
- You certainly did invite them!

42:24.333 --> 42:25.713
- I did not!
- Yes, you did.

42:25.713 --> 42:26.812
- Not!
- You went "yes"!

42:26.812 --> 42:27.533
- Not!
- Yes!

42:27.533 --> 42:28.076
- Not!
- Yes!

42:28.076 --> 42:29.475
- Not!
- Yes, you did!

42:29.475 --> 42:32.190
You said as clear as day: "Why
don't you come over for drinks?"

42:32.190 --> 42:35.364
- Oh, now!
- "Maybe for dinner! Heck! Let's have a party!"

42:35.364 --> 42:36.683
- That's what you said!.
- No, no, no.

42:36.683 --> 42:38.905
Yes, it is.
Is that what he said?

42:38.905 --> 42:41.030
- Technically, yes.
- "Technically"?

42:41.030 --> 42:43.033
You should have defended me
on the moustache thing.

42:43.033 --> 42:47.758
I didn't mean it, okay?
I was lyin'!

42:48.526 --> 42:51.448
You know, I had no intention
of inviting them over here

42:51.448 --> 42:52.854
for drinks or anything else.

42:52.854 --> 42:55.526
Let's just put it down to the fact
that I'm a bad neighbor, all right?

42:55.526 --> 42:58.994
That... as soon as they understand that,
everyone will get along fine.

43:00.561 --> 43:04.919
- That's good. What is that?
- Hummus.

43:04.919 --> 43:06.844
- What-us?
- Hummus.

43:06.844 --> 43:10.726
Some sliced vegetables,
a side of hummus. A hummus-side!

43:12.287 --> 43:14.075
That's funny.

43:19.699 --> 43:20.580
Hello?

43:20.580 --> 43:22.749
I can't believe you've never
seen the show before.

43:22.749 --> 43:24.924
All right, now,
which one is Stimpy?

43:25.051 --> 43:28.629
Stimpy's the cat...
and Ren is the Chihuahua.

43:28.629 --> 43:31.963
- You idiot!
- And-and-and-and which one is Stinky?

43:31.963 --> 43:34.652
Stinky is not a regular on the show.
Stinky just appears every now and again...

43:34.652 --> 43:37.551
<i>Oh, oh, so the bodily functions
don't appear every day?</i>

43:37.551 --> 43:41.289
No, it's-it's like a guest-starring bodily
function. Sometimes it's rotting teeth,

43:41.289 --> 43:43.444
- sometimes it's farts.
- Where have I been?

43:43.469 --> 43:46.865
You know, this is the end of Western
civilization as we know it, don't you?

43:47.749 --> 43:50.033
- I got the tap in.
- Goodbye.

44:06.235 --> 44:08.757
Hey, I'm not just
a piece of meat, you know.

44:39.513 --> 44:44.162
1.58 a.m.
Mrs. O'Hara goes peepee.

44:45.546 --> 44:49.176
Do you have to go peepee?
Hmm? I bet you do.

44:49.375 --> 44:52.525
Well, you should have thought
about that before we left for the island.

44:57.133 --> 44:58.738
No! Chris!
Don't take the car.

44:58.738 --> 45:01.380
You'll kill your... self!

45:21.800 --> 45:26.270
Nice steady stream.
No penile obstructions.

45:30.699 --> 45:35.989
3.58 a.m.
Mr. O'Hara goes peepee.

45:39.889 --> 45:44.611
Two peepees in one night. You people
are gonna give me high blood pressure.

46:13.780 --> 46:15.990
What is it, Archie?
What is it?

46:24.798 --> 46:27.892
What is so important at...

46:28.989 --> 46:31.265
4:41 in the morning?

46:31.689 --> 46:34.843
Come on, Brian, Pam,
talk to me.

46:36.062 --> 46:37.602
Is it Delano?

46:41.739 --> 46:44.339
No, Bill,
it's not Delano.

46:45.776 --> 46:47.957
It's diarrhea.

46:50.850 --> 46:53.382
You know all about diarrhea,
don't you, Arch?

46:54.446 --> 46:55.981
I bet you get it
when someone gives you

46:55.981 --> 46:58.803
a nice big piece
of chocolate.

46:59.515 --> 47:02.039
Come here. Come here.

47:26.878 --> 47:28.613
Get off mommy's bed.

47:30.287 --> 47:32.137
Hurry up, hurry up.
Come on, let's go, let's go!

47:32.137 --> 47:32.311
What?

47:32.311 --> 47:34.092
Do you wanna be part
of this stakeout or not?

47:34.092 --> 47:34.322
Okay.

47:34.357 --> 47:37.606
Come on, come on, come on.
You've got to follow 'im!

47:37.606 --> 47:40.150
- He might be going to meet Delano.
- Why?

47:40.150 --> 47:42.331
And I'm injured!
Come on, take the dog!

47:42.331 --> 47:44.050
Get the dog! Archie!

47:53.362 --> 47:54.965
Get up or move over.

47:58.019 --> 48:00.184
They had a lot to talk about
at 4:00 in the morning.

48:00.184 --> 48:02.141
I think we should
put in a bug.

48:08.806 --> 48:12.233
Mr. O'Hara went for a jog.
I told her to follow 'im.

48:14.114 --> 48:16.858
You told her to follow him?

48:17.987 --> 48:19.564
Call 911.

48:24.098 --> 48:26.603
Good, Archie. Good boy.

48:41.192 --> 48:45.646
All right. Okay.
Slow down for mommy, Archie.

48:48.173 --> 48:49.409
All right.

49:09.660 --> 49:12.550
Oh. Oh, God. Oh.

49:12.591 --> 49:15.086
Archie, no.
Mommy can't go, Archie.

49:15.086 --> 49:17.467
Archie! Archie!

49:18.730 --> 49:21.847
Okay, good boy.
Let mommy rest.

49:26.632 --> 49:28.036
No, Archie!

49:29.894 --> 49:31.566
No, not the bunny,
Archie.

49:31.566 --> 49:35.331
No, no, Archie. Archie!
Leave the bunny!

49:35.331 --> 49:36.661
No! No!

50:04.036 --> 50:07.014
Ah! A little
gardening action, huh?

50:07.014 --> 50:10.629
Love that gardening action.
What have we got, peas and carrots?

50:13.119 --> 50:17.576
Oh, yeah, yeah. Just...
There you go. Get those weeds.

50:17.576 --> 50:20.181
Get that. Turn around.
Turn around.

50:20.181 --> 50:23.028
Yes, get that weed. Yes!

50:23.028 --> 50:27.339
Yeah. Brian's home.

50:33.300 --> 50:36.754
No, I'll do that for you.
Ah! Oh!

50:37.179 --> 50:38.725
Feel better, huh?

50:48.993 --> 50:50.441
Where's Gina?

51:03.510 --> 51:05.241
- All right, slowly.
- Okay.

51:05.241 --> 51:07.151
- You all right?
- Yes, thank you.

51:07.910 --> 51:11.056
- I got you.
- Okay. Ow.

51:12.520 --> 51:14.167
Come on, Archie.

51:15.975 --> 51:18.677
- Okay, here we go. You all right?
- Oh, yes, thank you, Frank.

51:18.677 --> 51:21.705
- No problem.
- This ended up being such a joy.

51:22.631 --> 51:26.195
- What happened?
- Oh, I sprained my ankle. I'm fine.

51:26.354 --> 51:29.363
Hi. I'm Frank Sutter.
You must be Gina's father.

51:31.620 --> 51:35.365
Yep! Yep!
That's exactly who I am.

51:35.365 --> 51:37.979
By cracky Pa. Pa Kettle!

51:37.979 --> 51:42.878
Oh, oh, my God!
I... I've fallen and I can't get up!

51:42.878 --> 51:45.768
- Daddy? Stop it!
- Oh, you broke my Depends.

51:45.768 --> 51:49.853
- You take care of that ankle. I gotta go.
- How about some lemonade?

51:49.853 --> 51:54.036
Frank, Frank! Frank! Don't go!
Now, you can help me eat!

51:54.036 --> 51:58.237
- No, no, no, Frank. Frank!
- You can hold the utensil...

51:59.759 --> 52:02.124
You spineless,
selfish maggot!

52:02.494 --> 52:06.018
- Telephone.
- I heard it! Geez!

52:06.018 --> 52:07.942
- Police work!
- Yes, I'm not deaf!

52:07.942 --> 52:10.495
- Oh, the pain must be excruciating.
- Oh, just shut your trap!

52:10.495 --> 52:11.235
What do you think I did?

52:11.235 --> 52:13.556
- I ran my ass all over town for you!
- Shush, shush, quiet!

52:13.556 --> 52:15.519
<i>- Hello?
- Pam? It's Kate.</i>

52:15.519 --> 52:19.178
<i>- Hi! How are you?
- Oh, not too good.</i>

52:19.855 --> 52:22.674
<i>- What's the matter?
- Larry and I are getting divorced.</i>

52:22.674 --> 52:26.951
<i>- I needed to talk to someone.
- Oh, God, I'm sorry.</i>

52:26.951 --> 52:29.725
<i>- Are you okay? Are you at the house?
- Yeah.</i>

52:30.036 --> 52:34.638
<i>- I'm sorry, Pam.
- Hey, don't be sorry. Where's Larry?</i>

52:35.022 --> 52:38.738
<i>He left. I don't know.
I think he went to Henry's.</i>

52:38.957 --> 52:40.426
<i> Are-are the kids with you?</i>

52:40.426 --> 52:44.036
<i>No... They're... they're staying
with my parents for the week.</i>

52:45.396 --> 52:47.868
<i>Kate, are you and Larry
still seeing that counselor?</i>

52:47.868 --> 52:49.002
<i>- No.
- Oh...</i>

52:49.002 --> 52:51.061
<i>Pam, I don't wanna
make it work anymore.</i>

52:51.061 --> 52:55.952
<i>I'm sick of makin' it work. Larry's
a son of a bitch. And I hate him.</i>

52:56.052 --> 52:59.226
Will Larry and Kate stay together
or will they get divorced?

52:59.226 --> 53:02.841
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Please! Larry's a pig!

53:02.841 --> 53:04.623
Oh, and Kate's
an angel, right?

53:04.993 --> 53:10.565
Kate is a woman, Larry is a man.
Need I say more? I rest my case.

53:10.565 --> 53:15.085
This is really fabulous. I mean
this whole thing of being able to hear.

53:15.085 --> 53:17.924
I feel a teeny bit guilty,
but I'm really enjoying it.

53:17.924 --> 53:19.220
Don't go native on me...

53:20.099 --> 53:22.317
- Aaah!
- Get down.

53:22.352 --> 53:23.726
What? What?!

53:25.709 --> 53:27.060
Get down!

53:32.510 --> 53:34.689
Chris!
What happened?

53:36.004 --> 53:37.616
Somebody's out there.

53:38.748 --> 53:43.304
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I hate this part. Chris! Bill!

53:46.362 --> 53:48.897
- What do you see?
- I don't know!

53:56.821 --> 53:58.401
I'm gonna circle
around back.

54:10.624 --> 54:14.026
Cover me.
I'm taking a bath.

54:26.167 --> 54:28.688
Hello? Hello!

54:29.756 --> 54:33.809
Hi! I just rented the house
next door. My name is Chris Lecce.

54:33.809 --> 54:38.085
Yeah, I saw you yesterday.
I'm Barbara. Barbara Burnside.

54:39.273 --> 54:41.330
Did you lose a baseball?

54:42.633 --> 54:43.720
What did it break?

54:43.720 --> 54:46.614
- A window.
- Kitchen window?

54:48.721 --> 54:52.020
Ronnie! Ronnie!

54:52.386 --> 54:54.275
He always hides
when he thinks he's in for it.

54:54.275 --> 54:56.019
This is his responsibility.

54:56.054 --> 54:58.273
Well, look, it's-it's
really no big deal.

54:59.124 --> 55:01.910
Do you mind
coming with me, please?

55:18.499 --> 55:22.443
Phone! Somebody get the...
Somebody get the phone!

55:44.379 --> 55:47.153
Somebody get the phone!
I'm sleeping!

55:52.290 --> 55:55.003
- Yeah?
- Could I speak to det. Lecce, please?

55:55.397 --> 55:57.774
- Maria?
- Bill?

55:58.477 --> 55:59.989
Yeah. Where are you?

55:59.989 --> 56:03.709
- I'm at my mother's.
- Yeah, well, Chris told me what happened.

56:03.709 --> 56:05.386
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

56:05.611 --> 56:07.988
<i>My partner misses you.</i>

56:09.486 --> 56:10.725
Is he there?

56:10.725 --> 56:14.239
<i>Yeah, um... Look, no matter
how much of a jerk he can be,</i>

56:14.239 --> 56:17.921
<i>and... believe me, he can be
a jerk, I-I, you know, I know,</i>

56:18.791 --> 56:22.785
he absolutely, totally
adores you and loves you.

56:23.724 --> 56:27.841
Listen, you don't have to tell me,
but, um... is there another guy?

56:27.841 --> 56:29.583
Did he tell you
that was the reason?

56:29.583 --> 56:31.781
<i>Oh, no, no!
I-I-I just thought, maybe...</i>

56:32.470 --> 56:37.540
<i>you know, I-I just start
talking and... Forget it.</i>

56:37.657 --> 56:39.729
<i>I'll-I'll-I'll get him, okay?
I'll be right back.</i>

56:39.729 --> 56:40.756
Thanks.

56:41.869 --> 56:43.160
Chris!

56:55.363 --> 56:57.234
I don't believe this.

57:08.765 --> 57:11.599
<i>Hi, um...
I can't find 'im.</i>

57:15.895 --> 57:17.612
Where is he?

57:17.937 --> 57:21.189
<i>- I-I'll have him call you.
- Where did he go?</i>

57:21.189 --> 57:23.220
Uh, well, you see,
the funniest thing happened.

57:23.220 --> 57:26.275
This, uh, baseball, uh, went
through this window

57:26.275 --> 57:29.300
<i>- and, uh, he had to take it next door...
- Bill. Bill.</i>

57:30.863 --> 57:34.600
- No, don't bother, okay?
- Right.

57:34.600 --> 57:36.159
Bye.

57:45.029 --> 57:47.040
I just wanna
get some sleep!

57:51.794 --> 57:53.104
Phone!

57:57.240 --> 57:58.996
Telephone!

58:01.430 --> 58:03.172
<i>Hi, you've reached
the O'Hara residence.</i>

58:03.172 --> 58:04.580
<i>We can't come
to the phone right now,</i>

58:04.580 --> 58:05.484
<i>so please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

58:05.484 --> 58:06.245
They're not home.

58:06.245 --> 58:08.920
<i>- Thank you.
- Oh, my God, they're not home.</i>

58:08.920 --> 58:09.644
Where the hell are they?

58:09.644 --> 58:11.743
I don't know where they are!
Where the hell were you?

58:11.863 --> 58:12.764
Where the hell were you?

58:12.764 --> 58:15.570
I-I was returning the baseball,
that's where I was.

58:15.570 --> 58:17.280
Well, I was taking a bath.
Excuse me!

58:17.280 --> 58:17.711
Aw, geez!

58:17.711 --> 58:19.407
What the hell is goin' on?
I was tryin' to sleep!

58:19.407 --> 58:20.807
Can't you people
keep from yellin'...

58:20.807 --> 58:22.740
Here, take the equipment.
We're puttin' in a bug.

58:22.740 --> 58:25.730
- We're puttin' in a bug.
- We're puttin' in a bug.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.382
Fine.

59:35.086 --> 59:36.086
Chris!

59:36.368 --> 59:39.387
Chris. They're coming.

59:39.868 --> 59:43.351
Bill. Bill!

59:44.473 --> 59:45.853
Come on, come on.

01:00:09.335 --> 01:00:10.427
The bag!

01:00:24.742 --> 01:00:25.947
They're coming.

01:00:42.346 --> 01:00:43.578
Hi, there.

01:00:43.578 --> 01:00:45.961
- Hi!
- Oh, look, it's, uh...

01:00:46.070 --> 01:00:47.484
- Gina.
- Gina!

01:00:48.196 --> 01:00:50.978
- What are you doing here?
- I just stopped by...

01:00:51.345 --> 01:00:53.701
here... at your house...

01:00:53.707 --> 01:00:56.797
today to...
invite you to dinner.

01:00:56.797 --> 01:00:59.780
I was in the shower
in fact, and I thought to myself...

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.977
those people next door are lovely,
why not some dinner?

01:01:02.977 --> 01:01:04.223
- Can I take that for you?
- No, no.

01:01:04.223 --> 01:01:06.211
Please?
It'd-it'd be my pleasure.

01:01:12.422 --> 01:01:13.387
Yes!

01:01:17.987 --> 01:01:22.567
Yes, isn't it great? And I was
thinking, perhaps, dinner sometime soon?

01:01:22.567 --> 01:01:24.750
- Uh, like, when?
- Like, uh...

01:01:24.792 --> 01:01:27.812
I was thinking... that...
Like, tonight.

01:01:29.488 --> 01:01:32.448
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:36.315
Yes. Thank God.
All right, then.

01:01:50.404 --> 01:01:52.421
What's happenin', Tom?

01:01:52.406 --> 01:01:54.135
- Do I know you?
- Not important.

01:01:54.359 --> 01:01:56.540
- What do you want?
- I want you to get back in the car.

01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.796
- What?
- We need to talk.

01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:00.016
- Get lost.
- Whoa, wait a second. Wait. Hold it.

01:02:00.129 --> 01:02:02.561
You're making my life
very difficult.

01:02:02.936 --> 01:02:05.445
Now, I need to know where she is
and you need to tell me.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:08.907
You stupid
son of a bitch.

01:02:08.907 --> 01:02:10.861
What the hell are you doin' here?
Are you crazy?

01:02:12.571 --> 01:02:14.341
We can still
get in the car.

01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:17.675
I don't know
where the hell she is.

01:02:18.269 --> 01:02:20.625
When I find out,
I'll call.

01:02:21.148 --> 01:02:24.309
Good.
Thank you.

01:02:26.078 --> 01:02:28.095
Keep the hell
away from me.

01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:30.317
Tommy!

01:02:31.461 --> 01:02:34.128
Just remember,
I do know where you are.

01:02:34.392 --> 01:02:36.629
- Okay?
- Okay, uh...

01:02:36.629 --> 01:02:39.544
I have a home security business.
I started it ten years ago.

01:02:39.544 --> 01:02:42.153
We broke up after two years of
living together. Her name was Louise.

01:02:42.153 --> 01:02:45.054
I have one son, Bill, by my
first marriage. She's dead.

01:02:45.054 --> 01:02:47.295
She wanted to get married.
I didn't. Hey, we should trade.

01:02:47.295 --> 01:02:48.939
You shouldn't have
any problem remembering this.

01:02:49.147 --> 01:02:50.566
Did you know that
you were illegitimate?

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:51.351
Thank God.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:54.261
I, now... Now,
my first wife's name was, uh...

01:02:54.428 --> 01:02:55.049
Cheryl.

01:02:55.049 --> 01:02:57.659
Ah! Don't help me!
Cheryl, it was Cheryl.

01:02:57.934 --> 01:03:00.294
Sometimes I really
miss mom, don't you?

01:03:00.294 --> 01:03:02.961
Just don't take any longer
in there than you have to.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.668
- Put the bug in and get the hell out.
- Home before midnight, pop.

01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:07.605
Forty-five minutes,
that's all you're gonna get.

01:03:07.605 --> 01:03:09.731
Then I'm gonna puke on the table,
they're gonna come home.

01:03:09.731 --> 01:03:12.340
- Forty-five minutes, check your watch.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey!

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:15.353
Don't you even think
of touching my hors d'oeuvres.

01:03:15.353 --> 01:03:17.009
Let me tell you something,
Miss Assistant District Attorney.

01:03:17.009 --> 01:03:18.340
- Do not use that tone with me.
- Just... just a minute.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:21.687
If this assignment gets blown,
I wanna go on record right now...

01:03:21.687 --> 01:03:24.978
that this is the most stupid,
dim-witted, idiotic,

01:03:24.978 --> 01:03:28.662
moronic piece of putrefied garbage
that I have ever,

01:03:28.662 --> 01:03:33.227
in my entire professional career, ever had
the displeasure of being involved with.

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:34.367
- Really?
- Really.

01:03:34.367 --> 01:03:35.304
And?

01:03:35.453 --> 01:03:39.830
Re... And I don't like the panties
hanging on the rod!

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:43.708
Excuse me, detective,
but the dryer was not working.

01:03:43.708 --> 01:03:46.813
You pathetic
Steven Seagal wanna-be.

01:03:46.813 --> 01:03:48.925
Walkin' around
all dressed in black.

01:03:49.002 --> 01:03:52.109
You think it's funny? Well, you're even
worse than he is, do you know that?

01:03:52.109 --> 01:03:54.414
You're just a flunky.
You're a sidekick.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.797
That's what you are.
He's Fred, you're Barney.

01:03:56.797 --> 01:03:59.400
He's Johnny Carson,
you're Ed McMahon!

01:03:59.839 --> 01:04:03.138
That's it!
Nobody calls me Ed McMahon!

01:04:03.283 --> 01:04:06.523
Here is my gun,
here is my badge...

01:04:06.523 --> 01:04:08.586
- and here is me... quitting!
- Me too.

01:04:08.586 --> 01:04:10.902
- You can't quit.
- Watch us.

01:04:11.422 --> 01:04:12.168
Oh, yeah, right.

01:04:12.168 --> 01:04:13.974
Oh, what are you gonna do,
just leave me here alone?

01:04:14.365 --> 01:04:15.430
Yes!

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:18.701
All right, I'm sorry!
I am sorry.

01:04:19.031 --> 01:04:21.192
- Really?
- I'm sorry about this whole thing.

01:04:21.192 --> 01:04:23.738
I'm sorry that you feel
this assignment is beneath you.

01:04:23.738 --> 01:04:25.748
I am sorry that
I brought my dog.

01:04:25.748 --> 01:04:27.351
I am sorry that
I was taking a bath

01:04:27.351 --> 01:04:29.440
when I should have been watching
the O'Hara's house.

01:04:29.440 --> 01:04:33.519
But most of all...
I am sorry we are not getting along!

01:04:33.519 --> 01:04:35.575
So if you wanna leave,
just leave!

01:04:37.462 --> 01:04:39.157
This is not working.

01:04:39.157 --> 01:04:40.900
You just go
and I'll cover for you.

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:43.346
I'll say, maybe, that
one of your alarms went off

01:04:43.346 --> 01:04:45.678
and you had to go,
okay? So just go.

01:04:45.678 --> 01:04:48.551
You think that we're gonna be
guilty and we're gonna stay.

01:04:48.888 --> 01:04:51.495
I have a job
that I have to do

01:04:51.495 --> 01:04:55.051
and you guys can just decide
what's right for you to do, okay?

01:04:55.797 --> 01:04:58.235
Oh, l-look at her.
She's doing the shoulder thing.

01:04:58.235 --> 01:05:00.493
- We're bein' had, right?
- Absolutely.

01:05:00.493 --> 01:05:02.277
We're outta here!

01:05:13.694 --> 01:05:14.871
Gina...

01:05:16.142 --> 01:05:19.179
They're here!
I knew you guys would stay.

01:05:19.179 --> 01:05:22.224
Bill, I want you to go in there
and put in the bug. You know why?

01:05:22.224 --> 01:05:23.648
You're the best bugger
I ever met.

01:05:23.648 --> 01:05:25.966
And, Chris, we've been married
for five years.

01:05:25.966 --> 01:05:27.553
I love you,
you love me.

01:05:28.243 --> 01:05:31.099
- This is gonna be fabulous!
- Wait, wait.

01:05:31.099 --> 01:05:32.493
- Be right there!
- Where are you going?

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:33.803
Gotta freshen up.

01:05:34.395 --> 01:05:36.905
- Forty-five minutes.
- Just a... Just a minute.

01:05:36.962 --> 01:05:39.040
Wait a minute. Wait, wait.
Where are you... where are you...?

01:05:40.263 --> 01:05:44.540
Jesus Christ, I can't believe
I got myself hooked into this one.

01:05:47.506 --> 01:05:50.105
- Goddamn it. Hi!
- Hi!

01:05:50.281 --> 01:05:52.683
- Here. Welcome.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

01:05:52.683 --> 01:05:55.539
That's very nice. Thanks a lot.
Hi, glad to see you.

01:05:55.539 --> 01:05:57.208
- Hi, good to see you.
- Thanks for having us.

01:05:57.208 --> 01:06:00.538
Come on in. What would you, uh...
What would you like to drink?

01:06:00.538 --> 01:06:03.883
- Cheryl will be down in just one second.
- Uh, Cheryl?

01:06:03.936 --> 01:06:06.782
Cheryl. Cheryl, my, my, um...

01:06:08.764 --> 01:06:12.404
I'm sorry. Cheryl is the name
of my first dead wife, uh...

01:06:12.404 --> 01:06:14.412
- Ah.
- Right. Sometimes, I call Gina Cheryl.

01:06:14.412 --> 01:06:16.792
It's a... Please, don't tell her
I said that because it's, uh...

01:06:17.643 --> 01:06:19.494
No. No, not a word.

01:06:19.494 --> 01:06:21.571
Please, please.
What can I get you to drink?

01:06:21.571 --> 01:06:23.886
- Oh, uh, scotch and water for me, thanks.
- Okeydoke.

01:06:23.886 --> 01:06:25.833
I'll take a vodka
if you've got it. Straight up?

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:26.802
You got it.

01:06:27.171 --> 01:06:30.968
- Honey? Pam and Brian are here.
- I'll be right there.

01:06:30.968 --> 01:06:34.523
- Would you like something to drink, dear?
- I'll have the usual, honey.

01:06:35.558 --> 01:06:36.924
The usual.

01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:40.447
His first dead wife?

01:06:40.729 --> 01:06:42.850
I told you I didn't wanna
be here to begin with.

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.834
I hope we brought 'em
cheap wine.

01:07:24.308 --> 01:07:25.581
Dude.

01:07:35.249 --> 01:07:38.498
Scotch... and water.

01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:42.716
And vodka straight up.

01:07:42.716 --> 01:07:46.735
And, uh...
The usual, the usual.

01:07:46.735 --> 01:07:47.966
Oh, Jesus.

01:07:51.446 --> 01:08:01.895
Ah! Gin and tonic.
Okay. Gin and... tonic.

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:08.424
- Hello, how are you? Lovely of you to come.
- Hi, how are you? Fine.

01:08:08.424 --> 01:08:08.769
Thank you.

01:08:08.769 --> 01:08:10.358
- Do you like chili?
- Chili?

01:08:10.358 --> 01:08:12.995
- Yes?
- I love chili. Oh, yeah, I love it.

01:08:12.995 --> 01:08:15.799
- All right. Here we have scotch for Brian...
- Oh, thank you.

01:08:15.799 --> 01:08:18.252
- and a vodka straight for Pam...
- Thanks.

01:08:18.252 --> 01:08:20.576
and a gin for... Gina.

01:08:20.576 --> 01:08:23.107
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- Aren't you drinking, Chris?

01:08:23.107 --> 01:08:26.337
No, no, not anymore.
Too many funny hats.

01:08:29.006 --> 01:08:31.166
Oh, honey, honey.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.832
Oh, honey. I'm...
Did I make that too strong?

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:35.685
- No, it's fine, thank you.
- Oh, oh, I'm really...

01:08:37.102 --> 01:08:38.839
- Honey.
- Thank you.

01:08:38.839 --> 01:08:40.554
- Should I try again?
- No, no, no, sweetheart.

01:08:40.554 --> 01:08:42.267
- Okay.
- It's fine, really.

01:08:42.267 --> 01:08:42.841
Okay.

01:08:43.089 --> 01:08:44.441
So tell me, uh...

01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:45.868
Where's your son, uh...

01:08:45.868 --> 01:08:46.999
- Bill.
- ... Bill.

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:47.888
- Bill!
- Yes.

01:08:47.888 --> 01:08:49.557
Yes. Actually, he went out
for a little while.

01:08:49.557 --> 01:08:53.103
Yeah, he should be back
in about, um, 37 minutes.

01:09:00.676 --> 01:09:02.461
- How long have you two lived here?
- Uh...

01:09:02.461 --> 01:09:04.734
- Five years.
- Yeah, just about, uh, five years.

01:09:05.241 --> 01:09:06.938
Cute, yes.

01:09:07.163 --> 01:09:09.707
Actually, we just spend the summer
and the weekends here.

01:09:09.707 --> 01:09:12.779
- Oh, the summers here are incredible!
- You'll love it.

01:09:12.874 --> 01:09:14.394
You, uh, keep a place
in the city?

01:09:14.394 --> 01:09:17.054
- Mm-hmm. Lake Washington.
- Yeah, we love being near the water.

01:09:17.054 --> 01:09:18.875
- We spent ten years in Las Vegas.
- Oh!

01:09:18.875 --> 01:09:20.005
- Vegas!
- Yeah.

01:09:20.005 --> 01:09:22.234
Really? Honey,
they're from Vegas.

01:09:22.234 --> 01:09:24.566
- Uh, would you like another drink?
- Yes.

01:09:24.892 --> 01:09:25.381
Pam?

01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:27.281
I would love one.
A drink would be great.

01:09:27.281 --> 01:09:30.215
- Honey?
- No, no. Thank you.

01:09:32.636 --> 01:09:33.750
Bill?

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:39.301
Bill?

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.031
Bill? God!

01:09:45.270 --> 01:09:48.651
You know, sometimes
it is just so peaceful here that...

01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:50.991
we... never...

01:09:58.079 --> 01:09:59.602
Honey?

01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:05.933
Drinks! Ha!

01:11:07.643 --> 01:11:10.276
- Well, this certainly looks delicious.
- Thank you so much.

01:11:10.479 --> 01:11:11.129
Wonderful.

01:11:11.129 --> 01:11:15.555
Uh, Brian was telling us before
that they're originally from Chicago.

01:11:15.555 --> 01:11:17.830
- Oh, Chicago.
- Chicago.

01:11:18.803 --> 01:11:23.099
- Oh, Chicago! We love Chicago.
- Oh, really? Well, you can have it.

01:11:23.518 --> 01:11:26.384
You know, Gina, this all looks
absolutely delicious.

01:11:26.384 --> 01:11:28.054
- Would you excuse me, please?
- Yes, honey.

01:11:28.054 --> 01:11:29.317
- Sure.
- Sure.

01:11:32.599 --> 01:11:35.058
- The chili's fabulous.
- Oh, I bet it is. It looks...

01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:41.934
So, how long have you
and Chris been married?

01:11:41.934 --> 01:11:42.848
Five years.

01:11:42.848 --> 01:11:45.528
- But you know Chris was married before.
- Oh, I know. I know.

01:11:45.528 --> 01:11:49.390
He must have started young.
Bill's, what, about... late 20s?

01:11:49.390 --> 01:11:51.227
- Thirty-two.
- Thirty-two?

01:11:51.227 --> 01:11:51.733
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:51.733 --> 01:11:53.819
- How old's Chris?
- Forty-five.

01:11:56.587 --> 01:11:58.669
Did I say 45?

01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:00.884
- I meant 55.
- Oh!

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:02.332
Chris is fifty-five.

01:12:02.332 --> 01:12:04.600
- He's the speed limit.
- Fifty-five!

01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:05.790
That's exactly what he is.

01:12:05.790 --> 01:12:07.486
- The big five-five.
- No kidding.

01:12:07.486 --> 01:12:07.851
Yes!

01:12:07.851 --> 01:12:10.028
- That is amazing. I can't believe he's 55.
- Really?

01:12:10.028 --> 01:12:10.251
He doesn't look 55, does he?

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:12.987
No, I thought he was
much much... much younger.

01:12:12.987 --> 01:12:15.692
Actually, it came as
a surprise to me, too, at first.

01:12:15.692 --> 01:12:16.172
- I'll bet it did.
- Really?

01:12:16.172 --> 01:12:19.624
Yes, it did.
Brian, how's the chili?

01:12:20.395 --> 01:12:22.754
- Yes, it... I'm...
- Yes?

01:12:22.754 --> 01:12:25.059
- You must save room for meat loaf.
- Oh.

01:12:25.059 --> 01:12:28.622
- It's armadillo.
- Yes.

01:12:28.622 --> 01:12:29.691
- Pam?
- Yeah?

01:12:29.691 --> 01:12:31.021
These are corn flakes.

01:12:31.021 --> 01:12:32.175
- Oh.
- Yes.

01:12:32.175 --> 01:12:33.995
- Get outta here.
- They're corn flakes.

01:12:33.995 --> 01:12:37.313
Not much of an armadillo eater,
but I'll try it.

01:12:37.256 --> 01:12:40.695
No, no, Brian, it's meat loaf.
It's just shaped that way.

01:12:49.624 --> 01:12:50.644
Bill.

01:12:55.227 --> 01:12:56.953
Bill.

01:13:02.554 --> 01:13:03.999
Bill?

01:13:13.770 --> 01:13:15.085
Bill.

01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:17.229
Bill!

01:13:20.422 --> 01:13:22.124
Oh! Oh!

01:13:23.395 --> 01:13:24.627
Shit!

01:13:31.198 --> 01:13:32.706
You know, Brian and I

01:13:32.706 --> 01:13:35.605
- have been married almost ten years.
- No!

01:13:35.605 --> 01:13:38.912
- I can hardly believe it.
- Oh, that is just so wonderful.

01:13:38.912 --> 01:13:41.631
- Thank you.
- You know, marriage isn't always easy.

01:13:42.148 --> 01:13:44.321
Now, come on. Ours hasn't been
that bad, has it?

01:13:44.321 --> 01:13:47.286
- Oh, honey, I wasn't talking about ours.
- Okay. All right.

01:13:47.286 --> 01:13:48.848
We've a couple of friends
who are splitting up.

01:13:48.848 --> 01:13:49.873
Oh.

01:13:49.873 --> 01:13:52.830
For the umpteenth time. I don't know
why they just don't get it over with.

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:54.908
I'm sure if it was that easy
they would.

01:13:54.908 --> 01:13:57.194
Yeah, well, it's never that easy
when kids are involved.

01:13:57.194 --> 01:13:59.790
Well, excuse me, but it's my opinion
that it's harder on the kids

01:13:59.790 --> 01:14:01.454
when people like that
stay together.

01:14:01.454 --> 01:14:05.239
- Yeah, but you've got to try, honey.
- Well, of course, dear, you have to try.

01:14:05.239 --> 01:14:07.974
They should try.
But if it's not working,

01:14:07.974 --> 01:14:10.449
nothing they do is gonna
make it right, now is it?

01:14:10.449 --> 01:14:14.412
Beside, Kate is a real bitch. I wouldn't
be married to her for ten seconds.

01:14:14.412 --> 01:14:15.798
Kate is not that bad.

01:14:15.798 --> 01:14:18.818
Kate is a friend of yours,
and I'd rather not get into it right now.

01:14:19.099 --> 01:14:23.335
Far be it for me to interrupt, however,
it's never just one person's fault, is it?

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:26.549
I'm sure Larry bears just
as much responsibility as Kate.

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:29.932
Well, excuse me, but I've known Larry
longer than the both of you.

01:14:35.848 --> 01:14:37.584
You know
Kate and Larry?

01:14:38.867 --> 01:14:43.091
Well, um... I don't
know them, actually, no.

01:14:43.219 --> 01:14:44.947
You've met them?

01:14:47.199 --> 01:14:49.010
Not exactly.

01:14:49.545 --> 01:14:52.753
- How do you not exactly meet somebody?
- Hmm?

01:15:08.645 --> 01:15:09.698
Oh, honey!

01:15:12.251 --> 01:15:16.664
Oh, uh...
The bathroom faucet got all, uh...

01:15:17.048 --> 01:15:20.300
You know, spritz me and I had
to change. So what did I miss?

01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:22.612
Do you know
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

01:15:23.278 --> 01:15:25.840
Kate and Larry Sawyer.

01:15:26.299 --> 01:15:29.465
Uh, Kate and Larry Sawyer,
Kate and Larry Sawyer. Um...

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:33.297
Golly, honey, do I know...
Kate and Larry Sawyer?

01:15:33.297 --> 01:15:37.698
No, sweetheart, you do not
but I do in my own special way and...

01:15:37.942 --> 01:15:39.994
honey,
I've decided to tell them.

01:15:40.568 --> 01:15:42.511
Oh, no. I don't think that
would be a good idea, dear.

01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:44.421
- Yes, sweetheart, yes.
- No, no, no.

01:15:44.421 --> 01:15:45.087
- Yes.
- No.

01:15:45.087 --> 01:15:45.579
- Yes.
- No.

01:15:45.579 --> 01:15:45.996
- Yes.
- No.

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:48.487
- Yeeees.
- No.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.537
Pam, Brian...

01:15:53.075 --> 01:15:55.828
I have the ability
to see things.

01:15:56.757 --> 01:15:59.861
I hate to say this.
Some people even say that I'm psychic.

01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:03.923
It's strange. Ideas, images,
thoughts, names just pop in my head.

01:16:03.923 --> 01:16:07.421
Just before, I was thinking
Larry, Kate Sawyer.

01:16:07.421 --> 01:16:10.444
I don't know how. I don't know
where. It's frightening, isn't it?

01:16:10.444 --> 01:16:13.581
I can't even watch "Jeopardy".
I know all the answers. It's crazy!

01:16:13.581 --> 01:16:15.928
It scares Chris, actually.
It really does.

01:16:15.928 --> 01:16:18.109
He doesn't like me to talk about it.
Do you, honey?

01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:23.606
No, knock yourself out.

01:16:25.693 --> 01:16:27.172
- Telephone!
- Telephone!

01:16:29.322 --> 01:16:32.832
You know, I've never met anyone
who could actually do it.

01:16:32.832 --> 01:16:35.108
Oh, I don't do it,
it just sorta happens.

01:16:35.108 --> 01:16:38.480
Well, I've gotta do it.
Go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.291
- Hello?
- Chris?

01:16:41.250 --> 01:16:44.104
- Maria?
- You called.

01:16:44.548 --> 01:16:46.878
Yeah. Yeah.
Hold on one second.

01:16:47.566 --> 01:16:50.232
- Are you okay?
- Fine. You?

01:16:51.137 --> 01:16:53.892
I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:16:53.892 --> 01:16:55.892
I'm going back
to Veracruz.

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.864
- For how long?
- I've been offered a job.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:02.312
Well... Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

01:17:02.514 --> 01:17:04.668
Are you talking about
permanently moving?

01:17:04.668 --> 01:17:06.602
I'm leaving Friday.

01:17:08.596 --> 01:17:12.584
- Are you tryin' to kill me?
- No, I... just want a life.

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:17.173
I want kids and I'm sick
of... hearing myself ask for it.

01:17:17.173 --> 01:17:20.500
Maria, how do I tell you that I
love you and make you believe it?

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:21.801
What do I say?

01:17:21.801 --> 01:17:24.888
- Don't.
- No, no, no, just... just listen to me.

01:17:25.454 --> 01:17:26.764
Maria...

01:17:28.223 --> 01:17:33.544
I... I wanna marry you.

01:17:34.198 --> 01:17:35.614
Did you hear me?

01:17:35.614 --> 01:17:37.431
I know you think
I'm only saying something that...

01:17:37.431 --> 01:17:38.564
- that I think you wanna hear,
- Chris! Chris!

01:17:38.564 --> 01:17:40.300
- but I really mean it.
- Chris, don't do it like this.

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.731
Chris, don't do it like this.
Not on the phone like this!

01:17:42.731 --> 01:17:44.276
All right, it's not on the phone.
Bad idea, bad.

01:17:44.276 --> 01:17:47.175
Let's, let's start again,
all right? Just...

01:17:49.389 --> 01:17:52.342
I will do anything
I have to do.

01:17:52.937 --> 01:17:56.866
Anything at all, no matter how hard
it is. Except it's very hard now to talk.

01:17:58.239 --> 01:18:02.706
I want to marry you.
I wanna marry you...

01:18:03.964 --> 01:18:05.167
tonight.

01:18:06.636 --> 01:18:10.415
I'm willing to leave here.
We'll go to a justice of the peace.

01:18:10.415 --> 01:18:13.576
- I gotta go.
- No, wait! No, no, no, wait! Aw!

01:19:21.112 --> 01:19:25.061
I'm sensing...
you have been very stressed lately.

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:28.365
- Oh, you're right.
- Yes, I know, very very stressed.

01:19:28.365 --> 01:19:30.588
Something concerning...

01:19:31.281 --> 01:19:34.078
Brian and another woman.

01:19:34.513 --> 01:19:38.831
Yes, Pam, I feel it.
It's... a woman from his past.

01:19:38.831 --> 01:19:40.848
- I don't know the nature of the relationship.
- Honey.

01:19:40.848 --> 01:19:43.637
- One second. It could be sexual, it may not.
- Honey, honey. Could I...

01:19:43.637 --> 01:19:44.938
- One second, sweetheart.
- No, no, no, honey.

01:19:44.938 --> 01:19:47.339
- Honey, sweetheart, darling.
- It's someone that he... Wait.

01:19:47.339 --> 01:19:48.320
- Honey?
- Yes.

01:19:48.386 --> 01:19:50.350
Honey, uh...
This is the first time

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:52.218
the O'Haras have ever been
over for dinner

01:19:52.218 --> 01:19:54.201
and I think, maybe,
it's not such a good idea that,

01:19:54.201 --> 01:19:56.956
you know, they think this kind
of thing happens all the time.

01:19:56.956 --> 01:20:00.091
- You know, you're right. I'm sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:01.511
- I really am.
- It's okay.

01:20:01.511 --> 01:20:03.717
All right. Sweetheart,
was that Bill on the phone?

01:20:03.717 --> 01:20:06.043
- No, no, just some public opinion poll.
- I knew that.

01:20:06.043 --> 01:20:09.509
- I knew it was a public opinion poll.
- Pardon me, excuse me. Pam?

01:20:09.670 --> 01:20:12.498
Honey, I've developed a bit of a
headache and I think we should be going.

01:20:12.498 --> 01:20:13.960
Thanks very much
for having us over.

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.021
Oh, no, you...
you haven't had dessert yet.

01:20:16.056 --> 01:20:17.476
- No, no, no, we really...
- Would you like some aspirin?

01:20:17.476 --> 01:20:17.844
No.

01:20:17.844 --> 01:20:18.828
- Or some Motrin?
- No.

01:20:18.828 --> 01:20:19.735
- Some Tylenol?
- No.

01:20:19.735 --> 01:20:20.862
- Or Percodan?
- No.

01:20:21.060 --> 01:20:22.049
Honey, please, let's go.

01:20:22.049 --> 01:20:24.646
Honey, I told you.
The psychic thing flips people out.

01:20:24.646 --> 01:20:27.082
Was that what happened, Pam?
Was it the psychic thing?

01:20:27.082 --> 01:20:27.777
Oh, no, no, no!

01:20:27.777 --> 01:20:30.725
Please, could I ask you,
just give us one more half hour.

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:31.931
She's been working
all day on this dessert.

01:20:31.931 --> 01:20:32.746
I have.

01:20:32.746 --> 01:20:35.267
You won't be sorry.
One half hour more, okay?

01:20:35.267 --> 01:20:36.405
Please.

01:20:36.682 --> 01:20:38.661
- Okay, fine.
- All right. Great!

01:20:38.661 --> 01:20:43.456
Okay. Let's move into the living room.
It is such a pleasure to know you two.

01:20:43.597 --> 01:20:45.467
- Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
- What?

01:20:45.467 --> 01:20:48.143
- Shh. I heard him at the phone.
- So?

01:20:49.648 --> 01:20:52.059
He said that he loved her
and he wanted to marry her.

01:20:52.059 --> 01:20:53.976
I even know her name.
Maria!

01:20:54.209 --> 01:20:57.492
"Maria, I love you. Maria, I wanna
marry you." Just like the song.

01:20:57.492 --> 01:20:59.250
I was waitin' for him
to start singin' and dancin'.

01:20:59.250 --> 01:21:00.722
Oh, my God.

01:21:00.722 --> 01:21:03.482
This guy has got balls
this big.

01:21:03.482 --> 01:21:05.753
She calls right here,
right under her nose.

01:21:05.753 --> 01:21:09.027
Some psychic she is. Her own husband
is in love with a woman named Maria,

01:21:09.027 --> 01:21:11.735
- and she doesn't even know it!
- I feel so sorry for her.

01:21:12.196 --> 01:21:14.250
They are not psychic,
they're psychotic.

01:21:14.250 --> 01:21:16.383
What kind of a woman makes
an armadillo meat loaf

01:21:16.383 --> 01:21:18.113
and God knows
what was in those eggs.

01:21:18.236 --> 01:21:19.591
- Pam.
- What?

01:21:19.715 --> 01:21:22.964
I wouldn't be surprised if this guy killed
his first wife. We gotta get outta here.

01:21:22.964 --> 01:21:25.473
- Let's go.
- No! No, no, no, we...

01:21:25.473 --> 01:21:26.299
Be right there!

01:21:26.299 --> 01:21:27.487
Oh, knowing these two,

01:21:27.487 --> 01:21:28.535
they will bring the dessert
to our house.

01:21:28.535 --> 01:21:30.156
Okay, listen, we'll just
sit down and eat fast.

01:21:30.156 --> 01:21:31.683
Fast, fast! Eat fast! Eat fast!

01:21:31.684 --> 01:21:34.407
- All we got's ice cream sandwiches.
- We'll tell 'em it's homemade.

01:21:35.813 --> 01:21:38.776
- We need somethin' else.
- Reddi-Wip.

01:21:38.788 --> 01:21:42.365
Very good. It was a good cover
with the psychic thing.

01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:44.139
- You really think so?
- Yeah.

01:21:44.660 --> 01:21:46.820
Thank you.
How'd you get all wet?

01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:47.838
I snuck over to their house.

01:21:47.838 --> 01:21:49.963
I snuck over to their house
looking for Bill.

01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:51.720
- Yeah?
- And the sprinklers went off.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:53.999
- Oh, God. Did you find 'im?
- No, he wasn't there.

01:21:53.999 --> 01:21:55.386
- He wasn't there?
- No.

01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:57.003
Give me that.

01:21:58.137 --> 01:22:00.545
I wouldn't worry about this too much.
We're not gonna be invited over for dinner.

01:22:00.545 --> 01:22:01.529
They already think we're nuts.

01:22:01.529 --> 01:22:04.054
They don't think we're nuts.
We're a perfectly normal couple. Go.

01:22:04.313 --> 01:22:07.201
"I scream, you scream.
We all scream for ice cream."

01:22:07.535 --> 01:22:08.975
- Great.
- Oh, thank you.

01:22:08.975 --> 01:22:10.696
You're really gonna like this.
It's a specialty.

01:22:10.696 --> 01:22:11.451
Oh, honey.

01:22:11.473 --> 01:22:12.495
Doesn't this look great?

01:22:12.495 --> 01:22:14.519
Oh, yeah, looks real good.
Looks real good.

01:22:14.519 --> 01:22:16.354
Oh, mmm, this is wonderful.

01:22:16.354 --> 01:22:18.211
You're gonna have
to give me the recipe, okay?

01:22:18.255 --> 01:22:20.109
- I will.
- Okay.

01:22:20.248 --> 01:22:22.234
Oh, it's terrific.

01:22:28.533 --> 01:22:30.450
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

01:22:34.539 --> 01:22:37.511
Oh, God.
Headache, honey?

01:22:37.967 --> 01:22:39.435
Honey, honey.

01:22:39.795 --> 01:22:41.072
I think we'd better...

01:22:41.072 --> 01:22:42.466
I think we're gonna go home.

01:22:42.466 --> 01:22:43.814
- Yes, I think it's time for us to go.
- Yeah.

01:22:44.330 --> 01:22:46.164
- No! No, no, no!
- No, no, no.

01:22:46.164 --> 01:22:48.083
No, no, really,
we have to go.

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:51.472
No, really, we... I have
an early tee time tomorrow morning.

01:22:51.799 --> 01:22:54.349
Thanks very much
for a very interesting evening.

01:22:54.349 --> 01:22:56.787
If-if... If you
could just... If you could just...

01:22:56.787 --> 01:22:59.507
Oh, the hell with this.
I'm goin' out there to find Bill.

01:22:59.839 --> 01:23:02.260
Well, get your badge.
They'll never believe you're a cop.

01:23:07.323 --> 01:23:09.537
- Oh, my God.
- Did you call the police?

01:23:09.537 --> 01:23:11.748
- No.
- Lu, you've gotta call the police.

01:23:11.748 --> 01:23:14.420
If I tell the police,
they'll take me back to testify.

01:23:14.664 --> 01:23:15.924
I have to leave.

01:23:15.924 --> 01:23:17.537
What about him?
What are you gonna do with him?

01:23:20.235 --> 01:23:21.895
- I'll have to kill 'im.
- Hmm?

01:23:23.263 --> 01:23:24.635
Brian, talk to her.

01:23:26.290 --> 01:23:29.190
- Shut up.
- Wait. Wait. Lu, wait a minute, now.

01:23:29.190 --> 01:23:30.232
What do you mean,
you're just gonna kill 'im?

01:23:30.232 --> 01:23:31.768
That's it?
You kill 'im and that's it?

01:23:31.981 --> 01:23:33.631
He came here to kill me.

01:23:34.967 --> 01:23:39.045
Shut up! Look, if he lives,
he'll tell them that you helped me.

01:23:39.045 --> 01:23:40.780
Then they're comin' after you.

01:23:41.087 --> 01:23:42.517
Shut up!

01:23:46.158 --> 01:23:48.383
Get up. Get up.
Come on.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.095
He's probably
havin' a beer somewhere.

01:24:11.835 --> 01:24:12.847
Shit.

01:26:00.014 --> 01:26:02.455
Try anything,
I'll shoot you. Get out.

01:26:02.455 --> 01:26:04.100
Come on, get up.

01:26:09.351 --> 01:26:10.824
I don't see them.

01:26:12.514 --> 01:26:15.494
Goddamn it.
Must have turned off.

01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:18.943
Come on, come on!
So how much was I worth, huh?

01:26:18.943 --> 01:26:21.645
25? 30,000?
Huh?

01:26:21.756 --> 01:26:23.152
Keep going.

01:26:23.512 --> 01:26:26.850
You shouldn't have come after me.
You just shouldn't have come.

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:29.126
I wasn't gonna testify.

01:26:29.387 --> 01:26:32.914
Don't stop! You don't do
anything unless I tell you.

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:36.009
Maybe you're the guy
that killed Michael. Huh?

01:26:36.009 --> 01:26:38.401
Are you?
Did you kill Michael?

01:26:38.401 --> 01:26:41.078
I bet you are,
you son of a bitch!

01:26:41.078 --> 01:26:43.909
I just bet you are.
You killed Michael, didn't you?

01:26:44.015 --> 01:26:46.034
Now I'm gonna kill you.
Get down!

01:26:49.624 --> 01:26:53.302
If you believe in God, you better
pray for forgiveness now.

01:26:53.302 --> 01:26:55.417
Because you got no time left.

01:27:34.834 --> 01:27:36.011
Watch out!

01:27:41.346 --> 01:27:42.616
Go get Bill!

01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.724
Hang on, Bill!

01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:21.761
Okay!

01:28:22.288 --> 01:28:23.293
Okay.

01:28:25.009 --> 01:28:25.985
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:28:25.985 --> 01:28:27.200
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:40.841 --> 01:28:42.632
Get away
from the dock!

01:28:46.242 --> 01:28:48.938
I'll get it!
I'm gonna get the car!

01:28:52.949 --> 01:28:54.086
- She okay?
- Yeah.

01:28:54.086 --> 01:28:55.198
How about you?

01:28:55.198 --> 01:28:57.439
- I'm fine. Where's Bill?
- Up there.

01:29:27.557 --> 01:29:30.061
Okay! I got 'er!

01:29:41.032 --> 01:29:42.448
Oo-ha!

01:29:43.325 --> 01:29:46.513
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo!

01:30:04.504 --> 01:30:07.467
<i>This is the final boarding call
for Flight 610...</i>

01:30:20.428 --> 01:30:20.800
Yep.

01:30:20.800 --> 01:30:22.853
They found her on
one of those islands near Seattle.

01:30:22.853 --> 01:30:25.072
Staying with some family
named O'Hara.

01:30:25.072 --> 01:30:27.820
- She's agreed to testify, am I right?
- I don't know yet.

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:29.669
<i>We just got the call
from Seattle.</i>

01:30:29.669 --> 01:30:32.691
Don't worry about it. I'm catching
a plane, I'm bringin' her back.

01:30:32.691 --> 01:30:34.480
Look, I need to know
where she is right now.

01:30:34.480 --> 01:30:37.056
Do you follow me?
That woman...

01:30:39.442 --> 01:30:41.855
That woman...
will not testify.

01:30:41.855 --> 01:30:45.958
Yeah. I'll call
when I get there. Hey!

01:30:50.586 --> 01:30:51.908
Hello, Tony?

01:30:52.238 --> 01:30:56.440
Yeah.
We got work to do.

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:04.929
- Yeah.
- Dr. Gold, it's about Badham again.

01:31:04.929 --> 01:31:07.781
- So she's gonna be all right?
- Okay. A broken nose. She'll be fine.

01:31:07.781 --> 01:31:09.091
Thank you very much.

01:31:12.982 --> 01:31:17.525
Miss Delano. Am I glad to see you.
I can't tell you

01:31:17.525 --> 01:31:20.379
what an experience this has been
for all of us down in Las Vegas.

01:31:20.379 --> 01:31:22.156
We were so relieved...

01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.836
when we learned that they had found
you and that you were all right.

01:31:24.836 --> 01:31:27.113
Listen,
I know that this has been...

01:31:28.391 --> 01:31:31.663
extremely traumatic for you,
but I'm here to assure you

01:31:31.663 --> 01:31:33.762
that every precaution
has been taken.

01:31:33.762 --> 01:31:37.203
- We're gonna get you home safe.
- I have to see my friends first.

01:31:37.446 --> 01:31:39.188
Oh, the O'Hara's.
Well, you know what?

01:31:39.749 --> 01:31:43.075
I think it would be safer if we just
went straight from here to the airport.

01:31:43.075 --> 01:31:45.649
They don't even know
what happened to me last night.

01:31:45.753 --> 01:31:47.522
Well, you could give 'em
a phone call.

01:31:47.522 --> 01:31:51.801
No, no, I'm sorry. If I decide
to go back and testify,

01:31:51.801 --> 01:31:54.269
I want to see my friends first.

01:31:56.793 --> 01:31:58.452
Well, I guess, uh,

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:02.120
a quick side trip wouldn't do
too much harm.

01:32:02.358 --> 01:32:03.106
Not at all.

01:32:03.106 --> 01:32:04.942
And I'll stay with you
until you're on the plane.

01:32:04.942 --> 01:32:06.034
Thanks, Gina.

01:32:40.643 --> 01:32:43.443
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, shut up.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:32:45.418 --> 01:32:48.192
I'll let the dog out.
Will you grab my bag in there?

01:32:48.192 --> 01:32:49.172
Got it.

01:32:50.908 --> 01:32:51.793
Whoa!

01:32:52.161 --> 01:32:56.965
Archie! Archie! Archie!

01:32:59.003 --> 01:33:00.720
Archie, stop!

01:33:03.797 --> 01:33:06.540
- Archie, you come back here right now!
- Archie!

01:33:07.069 --> 01:33:09.217
- Archie! Archie!
- Stop it, Archie! Don't...

01:33:09.217 --> 01:33:13.799
- Come back here!
- Aw, sic 'em, Archie. Eat the cat.

01:33:14.531 --> 01:33:16.353
So I asked her to marry me.

01:33:16.496 --> 01:33:20.060
- Really? What'd she say?
- She hung up on me.

01:33:20.870 --> 01:33:23.935
- You asked her on the phone?
- Yeah, I asked her on the phone.

01:33:23.935 --> 01:33:27.642
Remember? I'm stuck on an island?
I'm at a dinner party, I can't get away.

01:33:28.493 --> 01:33:31.138
Dumb, stupid idea.
I know. Sorry.

01:33:31.138 --> 01:33:33.199
I'm sorry
I ruined my life.

01:33:33.736 --> 01:33:35.916
I'm sorry the suspect
got shot by my gun.

01:33:35.916 --> 01:33:37.878
I'm sorry the Mercedes
went into the bay.

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:40.977
- What about me gettin' hit?
- Sorry about that too.

01:33:40.977 --> 01:33:44.267
- And me rollin' down the stairs?
- I'm sorry about that too.

01:33:44.267 --> 01:33:46.753
- And my moustache?
- All right!

01:33:47.027 --> 01:33:49.421
What are you gonna do,
blame the deficit on me?

01:33:56.473 --> 01:34:01.277
Just... really sorry
that she walked out on me.

01:34:05.963 --> 01:34:10.065
Dad... we still have
each other.

01:34:10.681 --> 01:34:12.516
A reason to live.

01:34:22.843 --> 01:34:25.823
- Chris?
- Hmm?

01:34:26.276 --> 01:34:27.568
They're back.

01:34:29.506 --> 01:34:32.731
- Who?
- Gina and the woman I love.

01:34:34.299 --> 01:34:37.383
- Cops.
- Who's the other one?

01:34:38.339 --> 01:34:39.541
- Lawyer.
- Lawyer.

01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:42.432
- They're going back to Vegas.
- I'm sure gonna miss 'er.

01:34:42.432 --> 01:34:46.581
- Come on, let's get the hell outta here.
- Another car.

01:34:50.169 --> 01:34:52.261
More cops,
it looks like.

01:34:55.574 --> 01:34:58.280
- In a Mustang?
- Maybe another lawyer.

01:35:03.757 --> 01:35:06.770
This guy's got a gun.
Not a lawyer.

01:35:13.948 --> 01:35:16.475
She had to constantly
smear cream on herself.

01:35:16.586 --> 01:35:18.974
I spent a week
at the Mirage. I loved it there.

01:35:19.957 --> 01:35:22.694
Come on right in. Relax a minute.
Take a look at this, will you?

01:35:42.267 --> 01:35:43.770
- Get down!
- Down!

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:47.268
- Get down, there's a man!
- Behind the tree! He's got a gun! Get down!

01:35:47.922 --> 01:35:50.308
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, it's them!
- What?

01:35:50.308 --> 01:35:52.140
- Get down!
- There's a man!

01:35:52.883 --> 01:35:53.930
- Get down!
- Get down!

01:35:53.930 --> 01:35:56.356
Brian, Brian, it's them! It's those guys
that tried to kill me!

01:35:56.462 --> 01:36:00.180
Everybody, get down! No, not there,
not there! Get up here!

01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:02.709
Do it fast!
Keep your heads down!

01:36:05.441 --> 01:36:07.281
Police! Freeze!

01:36:11.538 --> 01:36:14.551
The idiots are shooting at us.
Stop shooting at us, you idiots.

01:36:16.141 --> 01:36:20.243
They think we're the bad guys.
Show 'em your badge.

01:36:20.243 --> 01:36:22.959
- They're never gonna believe we're cops.
- Gina's there, she'll tell 'em.

01:36:22.959 --> 01:36:24.640
Go on! Hold it up!

01:36:25.464 --> 01:36:28.344
Wait a minute.
Why don't you show 'em yours?

01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:29.863
You think I'm crazy?

01:36:30.099 --> 01:36:31.731
All right, all right!

01:36:31.826 --> 01:36:35.113
- Do it together. One, two, three.
- ... two, three.

01:36:35.113 --> 01:36:36.909
Don't shoot! We're cops!

01:36:39.191 --> 01:36:40.279
Great idea.

01:36:41.341 --> 01:36:44.595
- Can we shoot back?
- What if we kill 'em?

01:36:44.755 --> 01:36:46.572
- What if they kill us?
- Good point.

01:36:46.756 --> 01:36:50.731
Okay. You go,
I'll cover you. Go!

01:36:51.742 --> 01:36:54.717
Wait a minute.
Why don't... you go, and I cover?

01:36:54.717 --> 01:36:57.173
Because I'm already doing
the covering thing! Go on, go on!

01:36:57.465 --> 01:36:59.345
But you're older.
You got less to live for.

01:37:00.065 --> 01:37:02.782
- Get outta here!
- Don't shoot anybody.

01:37:14.885 --> 01:37:16.930
- Who'd you see?
- The same men.

01:37:16.930 --> 01:37:18.247
- The ones from last night?
- Yes.

01:37:18.345 --> 01:37:18.889
Oh, my God!

01:37:18.889 --> 01:37:21.267
Stop shooting! Stop shooting,
they're police!

01:37:21.267 --> 01:37:21.840
What?

01:37:21.840 --> 01:37:24.536
They're cops. Det. Lecce
and Reimers out of Seattle.

01:37:24.522 --> 01:37:26.961
They're with me.
Part of the stakeout next door.

01:37:26.961 --> 01:37:31.087
Bullshit! If they're cops, what the
hell are they shootin' at us for?

01:37:31.087 --> 01:37:33.985
- Because you're shooting at them!
- Call for backup.

01:37:41.747 --> 01:37:44.340
Chris, Bill, stop!
I told them you're cops!

01:37:52.128 --> 01:37:53.528
Oh, shit.

01:37:53.816 --> 01:37:57.804
- Steve. Steve! Hang in there, buddy.
- I'm all right.

01:38:09.393 --> 01:38:12.754
- What the hell are you doing?
- Hang on, Steve.

01:38:35.484 --> 01:38:36.179
In the basement!

01:38:36.179 --> 01:38:38.459
No, no, no! I gotta get her
outta the house!

01:38:40.444 --> 01:38:41.145
Go!

01:38:41.614 --> 01:38:45.556
- Tommy.
- You?!

01:38:46.859 --> 01:38:50.147
Jesus Christ, am I glad to see you.
I've been goin' nuts here.

01:38:50.147 --> 01:38:52.680
- Where is she?
- She's back there. Upstairs.

01:38:53.241 --> 01:38:54.931
It's great
workin' with you, Tom.

01:39:10.292 --> 01:39:12.320
- Bastard.
- I'm a cop.

01:39:14.568 --> 01:39:16.784
Run to the water.
Stay by the shore.

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.724
Don't stop for anything.

01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:23.352
- Go!
- I can't.

01:39:23.352 --> 01:39:26.151
Go!
Jump, goddamn it!

01:39:56.317 --> 01:39:58.226
Throw out your gun!

01:39:59.529 --> 01:40:02.330
Come out with your hands
above your head!

01:40:03.131 --> 01:40:05.413
This is the police.
You're completely surrounded!

01:40:05.413 --> 01:40:08.246
- You got ten seconds!
- No, you got ten seconds!

01:40:08.246 --> 01:40:11.083
You kill her, we kill you.
It's that simple.

01:40:11.083 --> 01:40:13.154
She's a friend of yours.
Wanna see her die?

01:40:13.154 --> 01:40:14.370
I'm sorry.

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.784
I'm sorry!

01:40:16.538 --> 01:40:20.699
You see. She's sorry.
Now back off.

01:40:20.767 --> 01:40:23.094
Back the hell off!
Now!

01:40:25.671 --> 01:40:28.049
Ooh, I don't like
what you're thinkin', ace.

01:40:28.846 --> 01:40:32.353
Cool heads, boys.
Cool heads.

01:40:50.413 --> 01:40:51.829
- Let's talk, gentlemen.
- No talk.

01:40:52.007 --> 01:40:53.695
Let's trade here.
What do you care?

01:40:54.641 --> 01:40:57.211
You want 'er alive, right? I don't
care about 'er, you can have 'er.

01:40:57.325 --> 01:40:59.226
But I get the other one.
I get who I came for.

01:40:59.226 --> 01:41:01.210
She walks away and I walk away.
Works for me.

01:41:01.210 --> 01:41:03.293
Shoot her. I don't care.
You're not walkin' outta here.

01:41:03.293 --> 01:41:05.057
Listen, nobody's gonna
blame you guys.

01:41:05.445 --> 01:41:07.583
But somebody is gonna die,
I promise you that.

01:41:09.084 --> 01:41:10.804
- You got a shot?
- I got a shot.

01:41:10.804 --> 01:41:11.509
You got nothin'!

01:41:11.509 --> 01:41:12.189
Take it.

01:41:12.189 --> 01:41:14.416
I'm takin' it.
I'm gonna drop this bastard!

01:41:14.501 --> 01:41:17.888
Listen to me. Shut up!
Let's trade here, all right?

01:41:17.888 --> 01:41:20.871
We're runnin' outta time,
boys. Runnin' outta time.

01:41:46.048 --> 01:41:47.410
- He got me.
- Yeah.

01:41:47.517 --> 01:41:48.961
- Did you get 'im?
- Yeah.

01:41:49.151 --> 01:41:50.830
- Am I gonna live?
- Yeah.

01:41:50.861 --> 01:41:52.249
Excellent.

01:41:52.334 --> 01:41:55.310
- Gina? Oh, my God. Is she all right?
- She'll be all right.

01:41:55.310 --> 01:41:56.997
- Are you sure?
- She'll be all right. Yeah.

01:41:56.997 --> 01:41:59.854
- Good dog, Arch. Good dog.
- Oh, good dog.

01:42:07.733 --> 01:42:10.025
- You havin' a good week?
- Perfect.

01:42:10.107 --> 01:42:11.890
- Hey.
- You hurt bad?

01:42:11.890 --> 01:42:15.601
Nah. Winged me, clipped me. Took a
hit in the shoulder. It was nothin'.

01:42:15.601 --> 01:42:18.146
- I'm just glad it wasn't me.
- Yeah, glad it wasn't me.

01:42:18.146 --> 01:42:20.274
Yeah, you know, I cannot believe
I'm about to say this,

01:42:20.274 --> 01:42:22.522
but... I'm actually gonna
miss you guys.

01:42:22.522 --> 01:42:25.461
- A little.
- Yeah, well, we're gonna miss you too.

01:42:25.461 --> 01:42:26.782
- A little less.
- Thank you.

01:42:26.782 --> 01:42:29.454
- The bad news is... your dog's okay.
- I know you love him.

01:42:29.454 --> 01:42:31.066
- We gotta go.
- I can feel you love him.

01:42:31.066 --> 01:42:31.532
Yeah.

01:42:32.188 --> 01:42:34.276
Hey, uh, listen, if I get
another assignment like this,

01:42:34.276 --> 01:42:36.175
- how about I give you guys a call?
- No.

01:42:36.350 --> 01:42:39.210
No? Right.
I am gonna sue for custody.

01:42:39.210 --> 01:42:40.297
- For him?
- Yeah.

01:42:40.297 --> 01:42:42.377
Take 'im.
He irritates the hell outta me.

01:42:42.978 --> 01:42:45.848
You were right.
I do look better without it.

01:42:46.913 --> 01:42:50.042
That's why I shaved mine off.
Because I look better without it.

01:42:50.042 --> 01:42:53.447
No. You shaved yours off
because you look old with it.

01:42:53.447 --> 01:42:56.066
- Oh, how old do I look?
- You look like, uh, Santa Claus old.

01:42:56.066 --> 01:42:59.107
- What? That's ridiculous!
- You look like a little old clockmaker.

01:42:59.107 --> 01:43:01.321
You're even starting
to smell old.

01:43:08.137 --> 01:43:10.740
- So, you wanna go get somethin' to eat?
- No, go home.

01:43:10.740 --> 01:43:14.876
You got a wife and kids.
They miss you. I don't know why.

01:43:16.627 --> 01:43:19.030
Why don't you come over?
You got nothin' to eat here.

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:22.022
No one to eat with.
You'll get lonely, depressed...

01:43:22.022 --> 01:43:24.017
You'll start wondering
what you got to live for...

01:43:24.017 --> 01:43:26.294
I'll have to go downtown,
identify the body...

01:43:26.294 --> 01:43:27.714
Come on, do it for me.

01:43:29.124 --> 01:43:34.214
It's only three storeys.
I'd just hurt myself. I'll see you.

01:43:34.355 --> 01:43:37.684
- Okay, dad.
- Enough with the dad thing.

01:44:15.608 --> 01:44:16.118
<i>Hola?</i>

01:44:16.118 --> 01:44:19.371
Hello, uh,
puedo hablar con Maria?

01:44:19.678 --> 01:44:22.564
<i>- Quien habla?
- It's Chris. Who do you thin...</i>

01:44:22.847 --> 01:44:24.284
Hello?

01:44:51.576 --> 01:44:53.922
Would you marry me?

01:45:02.578 --> 01:45:04.503
Yes.

01:45:16.791 --> 01:45:18.309
Awww!

01:45:23.933 --> 01:45:25.409
Ooh!

01:45:26.305 --> 01:45:32.626
