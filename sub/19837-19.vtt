00:04.020 --> 00:07.860
<b>Fearsome monsters... Exotic creatures...</b>

00:09.020 --> 00:12.110
<b>Vast riches... Hidden treasures...</b>

00:14.570 --> 00:18.330
<b>Evil enclaves... Unexplored lands...</b>

00:20.040 --> 00:23.150
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.150 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.490 --> 00:29.290
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.220 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.540 --> 01:56.800
<b>What?</b>

01:56.800 --> 01:58.050
<b>Are you serious about this?</b>

02:00.260 --> 02:02.030
<b>Dead serious.</b>

02:02.400 --> 02:06.340
<b>Those who win will join 
the ranks of the Hunters.</b>

02:06.810 --> 02:11.810
<b>Can't Win x And x Can't Lose</b>

02:14.730 --> 02:16.820
<b>Nine applicants:</b>

02:16.820 --> 02:20.070
<b>Gon, Killua, Kurapika,</b>

02:20.070 --> 02:23.200
<b>Leorio, Pokkle, Bodoro,</b>

02:23.200 --> 02:27.210
<b>Gittarackur, Hanzo, and Hisoka,</b>

02:27.210 --> 02:31.240
<b>head to the Final Phase, having passed 
the exam's Fourth Phase.</b>

02:33.340 --> 02:35.040
<b>Well, gentlemen.</b>

02:35.040 --> 02:37.210
<b>Did you get plenty of rest?</b>

02:37.830 --> 02:41.390
<b>This hotel is owned by the 
Hunter Exam Selection Committee.</b>

02:41.390 --> 02:46.220
<b>The place is all yours until the 
battles have concluded.</b>

02:47.500 --> 02:53.110
<b>For the Final Phase, we will be 
holding a one-on-one tournament.</b>

02:56.190 --> 03:00.630
<b>So only the last person standing passes?</b>

03:01.090 --> 03:02.360
<b>No.</b>

03:03.300 --> 03:06.120
<b>One win is all you need to pass.</b>

03:06.120 --> 03:07.580
<b>One win?</b>

03:07.580 --> 03:09.870
<b>Then, in this tournament...</b>

03:10.600 --> 03:13.430
<b>The winners are removed from competition,</b>

03:13.430 --> 03:16.810
<b>while the losers continue up the bracket.</b>

03:16.810 --> 03:21.620
<b>In other words, the person who 
finishes at the top will not pass.</b>

03:22.290 --> 03:24.260
<b>Does everyone understand now?</b>

03:24.260 --> 03:27.510
<b>So you're saying that only 
one person will fail.</b>

03:28.070 --> 03:29.300
<b>Exactly.</b>

03:35.570 --> 03:38.360
<b>And here is the bracket.</b>

04:02.770 --> 04:05.130
<b>Impressive, right?</b>

04:05.130 --> 04:10.850
<b>After all, everyone has at least 
two chances to win.</b>

04:10.850 --> 04:12.380
<b>But some people,</b>

04:12.380 --> 04:16.190
<b>like #294 and #405, get five chances.</b>

04:17.420 --> 04:20.200
<b>Why didn't you use a balanced bracket?</b>

04:20.200 --> 04:22.700
<b>A question that must be on everyone's mind.</b>

04:23.020 --> 04:26.060
<b>This bracket was assembled 
based on your performances</b>

04:26.060 --> 04:29.080
<b>throughout the entire exam.</b>

04:29.390 --> 04:35.460
<b>Those who performed better 
received more chances.</b>

04:36.750 --> 04:38.710
<b>That doesn't sound right.</b>

04:39.240 --> 04:42.210
<b>Can you explain how you 
scored our performances?</b>

04:46.020 --> 04:47.670
<b>No!</b>

04:47.210 --> 04:48.220
<b>Why not?</b>

04:49.770 --> 04:52.820
<b>Your scores are classified information.</b>

04:52.820 --> 04:55.060
<b>So I can't tell you everything.</b>

04:55.060 --> 04:58.730
<b>But I can explain our methods.</b>

05:00.190 --> 05:04.000
<b>First, we consider three major criteria:</b>

05:04.000 --> 05:07.330
<b>physical strength, mental strength,</b>

05:07.330 --> 05:09.700
<b>and overall impression.</b>

05:11.030 --> 05:15.000
<b>For physical strength, we use 
an aggregate of agility,</b>

05:15.000 --> 05:19.210
<b>flexibility, endurance, and perception.</b>

05:19.210 --> 05:23.800
<b>For mental strength, we use 
an aggregate of resilience,</b>

05:23.800 --> 05:27.300
<b>adaptability, judgment, and creativity.</b>

05:27.300 --> 05:30.010
<b>However, this information is only 
used as a reference point.</b>

05:30.010 --> 05:32.830
<b>After all, you were strong enough</b>

05:32.830 --> 05:35.050
<b>to advance to the Final Phase.</b>

05:38.100 --> 05:41.140
<b>However, we are most concerned 
with your overall impression.</b>

05:41.140 --> 05:44.350
<b>This refers to any intangible factors</b>

05:44.350 --> 05:46.400
<b>not previously mentioned.</b>

05:48.450 --> 05:49.650
<b>You could consider this</b>

05:49.650 --> 05:52.660
<b>an evaluation of your potential as a Hunter.</b>

05:53.370 --> 05:57.930
<b>And we also incorporate the 
opinions of your peers.</b>

05:57.930 --> 05:59.170
<b>That was our process.</b>

05:59.620 --> 06:02.820
<b><i>Based on performance, 
I should be ranked higher...</i></b>

06:05.330 --> 06:07.600
<b><i>Do I have less potential than Gon?</i></b>

06:09.510 --> 06:12.140
<b>The battle rules are quite simple.</b>

06:12.140 --> 06:13.470
<b>Weapons are allowed.</b>

06:13.470 --> 06:14.670
<b>No cheating.</b>

06:14.670 --> 06:17.370
<b>If your opponent admits defeat, you win.</b>

06:17.370 --> 06:18.440
<b>However!</b>

06:18.700 --> 06:21.560
<b>If you kill your opponent,</b>

06:21.560 --> 06:23.140
<b>you will be immediately disqualified.</b>

06:23.140 --> 06:27.800
<b>All remaining applicants will pass, 
and the exam will end.</b>

06:27.800 --> 06:28.700
<b>Are we clear?</b>

06:31.230 --> 06:34.030
<b>Then, we shall begin the exam's Final Phase.</b>

06:50.870 --> 06:53.860
<b>The first match is Hanzo versus Gon.</b>

06:54.380 --> 06:55.310
<b>Please step forward.</b>

07:19.830 --> 07:23.290
<b>I will serve as the referee.</b>

07:23.290 --> 07:24.540
<b>My name is Masta.</b>

07:24.540 --> 07:25.550
<b>Best of luck.</b>

07:25.550 --> 07:26.890
<b>Hey, good to see you again.</b>

07:27.500 --> 07:30.590
<b>You were tailing me during the Fourth Phase.</b>

07:31.640 --> 07:33.280
<b>You noticed?</b>

07:33.280 --> 07:34.440
<b>Naturally...</b>

07:34.440 --> 07:38.850
<b>I'm assuming that each applicant was 
assigned an examiner for the Fourth Phase.</b>

07:39.210 --> 07:42.750
<b>Well, I'm sure everyone else noticed.</b>

07:42.750 --> 07:44.610
<b><i>I had no idea.</i></b>

07:44.820 --> 07:46.860
<b><i>I obviously noticed.</i></b>

07:47.360 --> 07:50.210
<b>I thought it wasn't worth mentioning.</b>

07:50.210 --> 07:51.610
<b>Y-Yeah...</b>

07:51.900 --> 07:54.110
<b><i>How was I supposed to notice that?</i></b>

07:54.340 --> 07:55.940
<b>You have my thanks.</b>

07:55.940 --> 07:59.710
<b>My rank was higher because your 
reports on me were accurate.</b>

07:59.710 --> 08:01.590
<b>Though the outcome was never in doubt!</b>

08:01.590 --> 08:02.550
<b>Y-Yes...</b>

08:03.140 --> 08:04.630
<b>Moving on,</b>

08:05.200 --> 08:07.030
<b>I have a question for you.</b>

08:07.030 --> 08:07.880
<b>What is it?</b>

08:08.110 --> 08:12.010
<b>We only win if our opponent 
surrenders, correct?</b>

08:12.200 --> 08:14.660
<b>It doesn't count if we knock them unconscious.</b>

08:14.660 --> 08:16.500
<b>No TKOs allowed, either.</b>

08:17.140 --> 08:19.520
<b>Yes, that is correct.</b>

08:21.200 --> 08:22.270
<b><i>I see.</i></b>

08:24.220 --> 08:27.170
<b><i>This one could be difficult...</i></b>

08:28.920 --> 08:31.990
<b><i>He looks tough, but we should be even</i></b>

08:31.990 --> 08:33.780
<b><i>in terms of strength and speed.</i></b>

08:33.780 --> 08:37.030
<b><i>I can use my speed to keep on the 
move until I get an opening.</i></b>

08:37.440 --> 08:39.280
<b>Now then, it's time to begin.</b>

08:44.100 --> 08:46.290
<b><i>Get him, Gon!</i></b>

08:46.540 --> 08:49.290
<b><i>How well can he do against Hanzo?</i></b>

08:57.240 --> 08:58.050
<b>Begin!</b>

09:01.260 --> 09:03.060
<b><i>Put some distance between us...</i></b>

09:06.770 --> 09:09.440
<b>You must be confident in your legs.</b>

09:09.440 --> 09:10.520
<b>You have my respect.</b>

09:17.220 --> 09:19.240
<b>You did well for a kid.</b>

09:25.500 --> 09:26.410
<b><i>Tsk.</i></b>

09:26.410 --> 09:29.210
<b><i>I could have easily dodged that attack.</i></b>

09:33.350 --> 09:38.230
<b>Well, this would already be over 
if it were a normal fight...</b>

09:40.490 --> 09:42.390
<b>Here, wake up.</b>

09:45.400 --> 09:47.040
<b>You must feel terrible.</b>

09:47.040 --> 09:50.550
<b>I hit you hard enough to make 
your brain bounce around.</b>

09:50.550 --> 09:53.460
<b>Do you understand? 
You have no chance against me.</b>

09:53.460 --> 09:55.690
<b>Might as well give up now...</b>

09:57.370 --> 09:59.030
<b>No way...</b>

10:04.640 --> 10:06.040
<b>Think about it.</b>

10:06.470 --> 10:09.420
<b>If you surrender now, you'll still be in 
decent shape for your next fight.</b>

10:09.420 --> 10:12.290
<b>There's no reason to be stubborn.</b>

10:12.780 --> 10:14.480
<b>Just surrender.</b>

10:16.850 --> 10:18.430
<b>Never gonna happen!</b>

10:23.770 --> 10:24.650
<b>Surrender.</b>

10:43.980 --> 10:45.640
<b>Gon! Don't be silly!</b>

10:45.640 --> 10:46.910
<b>You'll still have another chance!</b>

10:46.910 --> 10:47.500
<b>You should...</b>

10:47.500 --> 10:48.410
<b>Leorio!</b>

10:48.810 --> 10:51.790
<b>If you were in Gon's position, 
would you surrender?</b>

10:51.790 --> 10:53.530
<b>Hell, no!</b>

10:54.700 --> 10:56.670
<b>That guy thinks he's hot stuff...</b>

10:57.040 --> 10:58.670
<b>Gon feels the same way!</b>

10:58.900 --> 11:01.260
<b>I know! I know that...</b>

11:01.260 --> 11:04.020
<b>But there isn't any other choice!</b>

11:04.020 --> 11:05.350
<b>You're contradicting yourself,</b>

11:05.350 --> 11:07.070
<b>but I understand how you feel!</b>

11:11.010 --> 11:12.730
<b><i>Yield this fight, Gon!</i></b>

11:12.730 --> 11:13.770
<b><i>It's suicide!</i></b>

11:15.230 --> 11:20.780
<b>Honestly, the chairman's nasty 
streak is in a class all its own.</b>

11:21.060 --> 11:22.510
<b>What do you mean?</b>

11:22.510 --> 11:24.730
<b>The applicants who've made it this far</b>

11:24.730 --> 11:27.290
<b>are unlikely to simply surrender.</b>

11:27.680 --> 11:29.290
<b>True.</b>

11:31.400 --> 11:33.560
<b>This goes beyond a "rather peculiar fight."</b>

11:33.560 --> 11:36.160
<b>This system is just plain crazy.</b>

11:36.160 --> 11:38.050
<b>That kid's in danger.</b>

11:47.080 --> 11:57.150
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

11:53.100 --> 11:57.150
<b>Hanzo</b>

12:17.430 --> 12:19.420
<b>It's been three hours.</b>

12:19.710 --> 12:22.170
<b>There's nothing left for him to vomit.</b>

12:23.540 --> 12:24.770
<b>Get up.</b>

12:26.990 --> 12:28.740
<b>Enough, already...</b>

12:28.740 --> 12:30.830
<b>I'm gonna kill you!</b>

12:30.830 --> 12:32.690
<b>I'll fight you in his place!</b>

12:33.930 --> 12:36.360
<b>If you can't take it, leave.</b>

12:36.360 --> 12:38.320
<b>It's only going to get worse.</b>

12:38.610 --> 12:40.070
<b>What was that?!</b>

12:40.400 --> 12:43.070
<b>No one may interfere in a one-on-one match.</b>

12:43.500 --> 12:48.700
<b>And if you step in, Gon will be 
the one disqualified!</b>

12:50.680 --> 12:51.960
<b>It's okay...</b>

12:53.520 --> 12:54.580
<b>Leorio.</b>

12:56.210 --> 12:57.200
<b>This is...</b>

12:58.700 --> 13:02.260
<b>nothing...</b>

13:07.270 --> 13:10.970
<b>I-I can still fight...</b>

13:16.740 --> 13:17.690
<b>I'm going to break your arm.</b>

13:23.380 --> 13:24.800
<b>I'm not joking around,</b>

13:24.800 --> 13:26.070
<b>so give up.</b>

13:27.380 --> 13:28.540
<b>Surrender.</b>

13:31.860 --> 13:34.140
<b>Never!</b>

13:47.190 --> 13:48.840
<b>He really broke his arm.</b>

13:50.340 --> 13:51.660
<b>There you go.</b>

13:51.660 --> 13:54.350
<b>You can't use your left arm anymore.</b>

13:58.980 --> 14:01.610
<b>Kurapika, don't try to stop me.</b>

14:03.210 --> 14:06.610
<b>If that bastard does anything else to Gon...</b>

14:07.420 --> 14:10.520
<b>Sorry, Gon, but I can't stop myself.</b>

14:10.960 --> 14:12.190
<b>Me?</b>

14:12.750 --> 14:14.020
<b>Stop you?</b>

14:15.680 --> 14:16.920
<b>Don't worry.</b>

14:17.260 --> 14:19.380
<b>There is no chance of that happening.</b>

14:20.470 --> 14:22.680
<b>I'm sure you're in too much pain to listen,</b>

14:22.680 --> 14:23.780
<b>but hear me out.</b>

14:25.000 --> 14:28.880
<b>I am descended from the shinobi, 
a clan of covert agents.</b>

14:32.100 --> 14:35.510
<b>From the day I was born, I was forced</b>

14:35.510 --> 14:39.520
<b>to endure harsh training in order 
to master the art of ninpo.</b>

14:40.140 --> 14:41.670
<b>For eighteen years,</b>

14:41.670 --> 14:45.360
<b>I have trained my body and 
technique, without rest.</b>

14:46.800 --> 14:49.410
<b>By the time I was your age, 
I had already killed a man.</b>

14:50.120 --> 14:52.910
<b><i>Heh, that's nothing to brag about.</i></b>

14:53.680 --> 14:58.730
<b>At this point in time, 
you cannot defeat me in combat.</b>

14:59.670 --> 15:01.000
<b>I'm trying to be nice.</b>

15:02.520 --> 15:03.880
<b>Admit defeat—</b>

15:09.140 --> 15:11.550
<b>Ow...</b>

15:12.600 --> 15:13.600
<b>Damn it!</b>

15:14.210 --> 15:18.600
<b>My head's cleared a bit, after all the 
pain and that long explanation.</b>

15:18.890 --> 15:20.850
<b>Yes!</b>

15:21.270 --> 15:22.880
<b>Gon, go!</b>

15:22.880 --> 15:25.610
<b>Kick him while he's down!</b>

15:27.430 --> 15:30.990
<b>If you're eighteen, you're only 
six years older than I am.</b>

15:32.420 --> 15:36.260
<b>Besides, this isn't a battle 
to see who's stronger.</b>

15:36.260 --> 15:39.500
<b>It's to see who's willing to surrender first.</b>

15:43.830 --> 15:46.090
<b>I let you kick me on purpose.</b>

15:46.410 --> 15:48.060
<b>Liar!</b>

15:48.060 --> 15:49.800
<b>You don't understand...</b>

15:50.280 --> 15:52.790
<b>This isn't a warning.</b>

15:52.790 --> 15:54.680
<b>It's an ultimatum.</b>

15:55.140 --> 15:57.890
<b>Was it too hard for you to understand?</b>

15:57.890 --> 16:00.060
<b>Then I'll make it easier for you.</b>

16:02.840 --> 16:04.970
<b>I'll cut off your legs,</b>

16:05.350 --> 16:07.320
<b>so that they can't be reattached.</b>

16:10.360 --> 16:14.570
<b>A permanent injury should 
help to wake you up.</b>

16:15.310 --> 16:17.990
<b>But first, I'll ask you once more.</b>

16:18.900 --> 16:21.080
<b>Surrender.</b>

16:25.810 --> 16:27.300
<b>I won't accept that!</b>

16:30.990 --> 16:33.440
<b>I don't want my legs cut off,</b>

16:33.440 --> 16:35.470
<b>but I don't want to surrender.</b>

16:36.200 --> 16:38.690
<b>So let's find a different way to fight!</b>

16:38.690 --> 16:42.100
<b>Hey... Do you understand 
your own situation?!</b>

16:45.890 --> 16:47.110
<b>Excuse me.</b>

16:47.590 --> 16:49.230
<b>You don't get to make demands!</b>

16:49.230 --> 16:50.520
<b>Are you trying to insult me?!</b>

16:50.520 --> 16:53.110
<b>I'm seriously gonna cut off your legs!</b>

16:55.290 --> 16:58.120
<b>But I still will not surrender.</b>

16:58.990 --> 17:02.950
<b>Besides, if you do that, 
I'll bleed to death.</b>

17:03.750 --> 17:07.350
<b>He'll be disqualified if that happens, right?</b>

17:07.970 --> 17:09.130
<b>Oh, yes.</b>

17:09.490 --> 17:10.740
<b>See?</b>

17:10.740 --> 17:12.840
<b>Neither of us wants that to happen.</b>

17:12.840 --> 17:14.380
<b>So let's think of a better way.</b>

17:20.780 --> 17:22.640
<b>I think he's okay now.</b>

17:22.640 --> 17:24.140
<b>Gon's taken control.</b>

17:24.700 --> 17:26.820
<b>He's so self-centered...</b>

17:26.820 --> 17:30.400
<b>But he's succeeded in convincing 
Hanzo and the rest of us.</b>

17:30.960 --> 17:32.250
<b>Honestly...</b>

17:33.120 --> 17:33.980
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

17:34.500 --> 17:36.490
<b><i>The situation hasn't changed.</i></b>

17:36.950 --> 17:39.160
<b><i>Gon hasn't gotten stronger than his opponent.</i></b>

17:39.560 --> 17:42.290
<b><i>His arm is still broken!</i></b>

17:43.040 --> 17:47.460
<b><i>So why is the brutal 
atmosphere from before</i></b>

17:47.460 --> 17:50.540
<b><i>suddenly so much lighter?</i></b>

18:01.440 --> 18:04.640
<b>You really don't get it...</b>

18:05.200 --> 18:08.020
<b>If you die, you'll never get another chance.</b>

18:08.730 --> 18:12.470
<b>If I kill you here,</b>

18:12.470 --> 18:16.100
<b>I need only try again next year.</b>

18:16.100 --> 18:18.530
<b>We are not on equal footing!</b>

18:20.040 --> 18:22.030
<b><i>He's right, Gon.</i></b>

18:22.760 --> 18:26.180
<b><i>You can try all you want 
to talk your way out of this,</i></b>

18:26.180 --> 18:28.250
<b><i>but he's far stronger than you.</i></b>

18:29.480 --> 18:32.190
<b><i>That isn't something you can 
neutralize on the spot.</i></b>

18:33.450 --> 18:36.290
<b><i>It all comes down to power.</i></b>

18:51.740 --> 18:54.490
<b>Why won't you concede? 
It's easy to do.</b>

18:55.220 --> 18:58.830
<b>You can try again next year.</b>

19:00.280 --> 19:02.870
<b>You value your pride more 
than your own life?!</b>

19:02.870 --> 19:05.700
<b>You're really willing to die for your pride?!</b>

19:14.500 --> 19:16.710
<b>I'm going to find my dad.</b>

19:18.130 --> 19:19.220
<b>Your dad?</b>

19:20.070 --> 19:22.460
<b>My dad is a Hunter.</b>

19:22.460 --> 19:27.040
<b>So I'm going to become a Hunter 
and find him!</b>

19:31.740 --> 19:34.280
<b>I believe that I'll find him one day...</b>

19:37.520 --> 19:40.910
<b>But I have a feeling that if I give up now,</b>

19:40.910 --> 19:43.090
<b>I'll never find him!</b>

19:46.420 --> 19:48.160
<b>So I won't surrender.</b>

19:52.980 --> 19:56.250
<b>If you don't yield, you'll die...</b>

20:01.780 --> 20:03.680
<b><i>He defies reason.</i></b>

20:09.820 --> 20:12.190
<b>I give up. You win.</b>

20:15.510 --> 20:17.730
<b>I can't kill you.</b>

20:18.080 --> 20:22.050
<b>But I can't think of a way 
to make you surrender.</b>

20:22.620 --> 20:25.200
<b>I'll take this loss and take my 
chances in the next battle!</b>

20:27.870 --> 20:29.380
<b>I can't accept that.</b>

20:29.970 --> 20:30.950
<b>That's not fair!</b>

20:31.960 --> 20:35.210
<b>We both have to think of 
a way to settle this fight!</b>

20:35.990 --> 20:38.960
<b>Heh, I knew you would say that.</b>

20:39.480 --> 20:40.510
<b>You fool!</b>

20:40.510 --> 20:43.810
<b>There's no point, because you'll 
never surrender!</b>

20:43.810 --> 20:46.780
<b>But I don't want to win like this!</b>

20:46.780 --> 20:48.180
<b>What am I supposed to do?</b>

20:48.180 --> 20:50.220
<b>We can work together to figure it out!</b>

20:51.850 --> 20:56.010
<b>In other words, I've already 
given up on this match,</b>

20:56.010 --> 20:59.490
<b>but you want me to try to win again,</b>

20:59.490 --> 21:05.020
<b>while helping to determine a way to 
make you feel good about your victory!</b>

21:05.020 --> 21:06.240
<b>Is that right?</b>

21:06.510 --> 21:07.370
<b>Uh-huh!</b>

21:07.370 --> 21:09.120
<b>You moron!</b>

21:11.610 --> 21:12.950
<b>Hey, ref.</b>

21:12.950 --> 21:15.290
<b>I lose. Let's move on to the next match.</b>

21:15.290 --> 21:16.510
<b>Understood.</b>

21:17.180 --> 21:19.460
<b>But I want to tell the executive 
committee something first.</b>

21:19.460 --> 21:21.020
<b>When he wakes up,</b>

21:21.020 --> 21:23.320
<b>he'll probably refuse his passing judgment.</b>

21:23.320 --> 21:25.340
<b>Because he's a stubborn boy,</b>

21:25.340 --> 21:26.810
<b>as we've seen.</b>

21:27.230 --> 21:29.800
<b>Only one person will fail this round, right?</b>

21:30.190 --> 21:36.020
<b>If Gon fails, wouldn't that make the 
rest of our fights meaningless?</b>

21:43.020 --> 21:46.310
<b>Gon's victory has been assured, 
following Hanzo's concession.</b>

21:48.400 --> 21:51.660
<b>The Final Phase, to determine 
the single failing applicant,</b>

21:52.680 --> 21:55.530
<b>has only just begun.</b>

23:28.420 --> 23:30.860
<b>Next time: Baffling x Turn Of x Events!</b>

23:32.640 --> 23:34.530
<b>They got Gon, too!</b>
