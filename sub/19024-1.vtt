00:02.333 --> 00:04.750
(J.D.) <i>Yesterday seemed like</i>
<i>it would be a good day.</i>

00:04.834 --> 00:06.000
<i>Then it happened.</i>

00:06.875 --> 00:08.041
Hey, everyone.

00:08.125 --> 00:09.208
Brace yourself there, newbie.

00:09.834 --> 00:12.709
Carla, my ex-husband
is in love with you.

00:12.792 --> 00:13.875
It's true.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.250
Ask your boyfriend.
He knows.

00:15.333 --> 00:17.375
He and Perry
talk about it all the time.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.709
Huh.

00:18.792 --> 00:21.333
And, Bob, when are you
gonna tell Perry

00:21.417 --> 00:23.583
that that promotion you're making him
jump through hoops for

00:23.667 --> 00:26.000
was filled months ago?

00:26.083 --> 00:28.291
Which brings us to twinkie.

00:28.375 --> 00:29.542
If you don't have to courage

00:29.625 --> 00:31.500
to tell your colleague
Dr. Dorian

00:31.583 --> 00:32.917
that you're still crazy
about him,

00:33.000 --> 00:34.750
I'm gonna go ahead
and do it for ya,

00:34.834 --> 00:36.625
'cause that's
what friends do. Yeah.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.125
And finally, Perry.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.291
You are not gonna believe
what happened

00:42.375 --> 00:44.667
the first time I met
your little protégé here.

00:44.750 --> 00:46.917
No!

00:47.000 --> 00:48.291
I slept with him.

00:48.375 --> 00:49.750
And it was good.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.166
Oh.

00:51.834 --> 00:52.750
Bye.

00:52.834 --> 00:54.083
(J.D.) <i>Call it wishful thinking,</i>

00:54.166 --> 00:55.542
<i>but I couldn't</i>
<i>shake this feeling</i>

00:55.625 --> 00:59.166
<i>that this was nothing more</i>
<i>than a very, very bad dream.</i>

01:01.625 --> 01:02.834
Whew.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.083
Good morning, tiger.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.875
(J.D.) <i>Of course,</i>
<i>I've been wrong before.</i>

01:05.959 --> 01:07.875
How can you let a woman
kick you out of your own bed?

01:07.959 --> 01:10.083
Baby, why you got to be so cranky
in the morning?

01:10.166 --> 01:11.041
This is unacceptable.

01:11.125 --> 01:13.125
You said we were
gonna sleep head to foot.

01:13.208 --> 01:16.000
Dude, either way, the naughty bits
is still in the middle.

01:16.083 --> 01:17.291
Yeah, but with the head
to foot alignment,

01:17.375 --> 01:19.041
there's no way
for them to lock in.

01:19.125 --> 01:20.875
Could you be more homophobic?

01:20.959 --> 01:22.959
Oh. I'm not.

01:24.583 --> 01:25.583
Ready to go?

01:28.166 --> 01:29.500
Morning, boy.

01:29.583 --> 01:33.333
I can't remember the last time
I was in this foul a mood.

01:34.166 --> 01:35.542
Rowdy, no.

01:35.625 --> 01:37.291
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

01:37.375 --> 01:39.625
Who would laugh at that?

01:39.709 --> 01:41.834
Get him, Rowdy!
Hit that!

01:41.917 --> 01:43.291
(laughing)

01:43.375 --> 01:45.959
I'm out of here.

01:46.041 --> 01:47.834
-Babe.
-(door closes)

01:48.625 --> 01:52.333
Oh, I hate that everything's so messed up
between all of us, you know?

01:52.417 --> 01:55.500
Just remember what I said to you
this morning in bed.

01:55.583 --> 01:56.500
I had my shoes on.

01:56.583 --> 01:57.917
It would have been impossible
to lock in.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.375
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?
Just be cool.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.750
-I'm cool. I'm cool.

No problem.
I keep it right down there

05:22.834 --> 05:25.000
in the "get it yourself" file.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.542
You know, Bob, I've been thinking about
all the times

05:28.625 --> 05:30.709
that you've manipulated me
and toyed with me,

05:30.792 --> 05:34.166
and, well, I can't help but recall
that children's fable

05:34.250 --> 05:35.959
about the race between the tortoise

05:36.041 --> 05:37.583
and the pain-in-the-ass
chief of medicine

05:37.667 --> 05:38.959
that everybody hates.

05:39.041 --> 05:41.208
You see, Bob, the pain-in-the-ass
chief of medicine

05:41.291 --> 05:42.291
that everybody hates

05:42.375 --> 05:44.125
kept running out
in front of the tortoise

05:44.208 --> 05:47.125
and taunting him,
but right at the end,

05:47.208 --> 05:49.959
oh, gosh, I'm sure you remember
what happened, Bob.

05:50.041 --> 05:52.041
The tortoise
bit clean through

05:52.125 --> 05:53.875
the chief of medicine's
calf muscle,

05:53.959 --> 05:57.792
dragged him to the ground, where he and
all the other turtles devoured him alive,

05:57.875 --> 05:59.625
right there on the racetrack.

05:59.709 --> 06:03.417
It's a disturbing children's book,
Bob, I know,

06:03.500 --> 06:06.667
but it's one that stuck
with me nonetheless.

06:08.083 --> 06:11.083
Buzzy buzz buzz.

06:11.166 --> 06:12.291
I beg pardon?

06:12.917 --> 06:16.083
Oh, that's the sound
of all the bees in your bonnet.

06:16.166 --> 06:18.917
And, Perry, even though
I could give a rat's ass,

06:19.000 --> 06:21.417
I still think
it's a pretty sound.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.750
(J.D.) <i>And just like that,</i>

06:25.834 --> 06:28.000
<i>it was my turn</i>
<i>to face the music.</i>

06:33.917 --> 06:35.417

06:35.500 --> 06:37.083
(J.D.) <i>What the hell?</i>

06:37.166 --> 06:39.000
-Dr. Dorian.
-Whoo!

06:39.083 --> 06:40.208
Here you go, whiz kid.

06:40.291 --> 06:41.834
Oh, is that my new nickname?

06:41.917 --> 06:43.208
'Cause, you know,
I actually thought people were

06:43.291 --> 06:44.542
gonna start calling me that
in high school,

06:44.625 --> 06:46.208
when I was in our production
of <i>The Wiz.</i>

06:46.291 --> 06:48.917
It was sort of the hip version
of <i>the Wizard of Oz.</i>

06:49.000 --> 06:51.667
Nipsey Russell played the Tin Man.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.458

06:53.542 --> 06:55.250
<i>♪ Ease on down the road ♪</i>

06:55.333 --> 06:57.125
Remember that? No? Well, anyway,
you know, kids can be mean,

06:57.208 --> 06:59.500
and everyone just started
calling me Dorothy.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.709
High school was hard.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.542
Oh. I'm sorry, sport.
I was thinking about soup.

07:05.625 --> 07:09.166
Now, Mr. Zerbo was initially admitted
with a high fever

07:09.250 --> 07:10.542
and suspected meningitis,

07:10.625 --> 07:13.667
but both the head C.T. and the lumbar
puncture came back negative.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.709
Uh, yes. Sir, I have a full patient load,

07:15.792 --> 07:17.750
and I don't understand how you can just
drop this guy in my lap

07:17.834 --> 07:19.250
and expect me to make him a top priority.

07:19.333 --> 07:22.041
Do you want me to say, "ta-da,"
so it seems more like a trick?

07:22.125 --> 07:24.917
Mr. Zerbo back there
is a major hospital benefactor,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.834
and, by golly, you know
it's a lot harder

07:26.917 --> 07:28.917
to write a big, fat check
if you're dead.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.041
Neurology, rheumatology,
hematology.

07:32.125 --> 07:33.959
This guy's been turfed
to every service in the hospital,

07:34.041 --> 07:35.625
and no one knows what's wrong with him.
What do you want me to do?

07:35.709 --> 07:37.333
I hope it's Navy bean today.

07:37.417 --> 07:40.041
-Dr. Kelso.
-Well, gee, sport,

07:40.125 --> 07:41.875
I would say you should stop whining,

07:41.959 --> 07:43.500
find out what's wrong with him,
and treat it,

07:43.583 --> 07:45.208
or you can be damn sure
I'm gonna give you

07:45.291 --> 07:47.625
something to whine about.

07:48.625 --> 07:49.625
Okay, fine, you know?

07:49.709 --> 07:52.208
After all, I'm the whiz kid.

07:54.333 --> 07:56.083
You are now.

07:57.542 --> 08:00.417
Ladies, now that the Todd is a resident,

08:00.500 --> 08:03.500
he wants to clear things up
so you don't have to wonder anymore.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.875
Yes, yes, no,

08:04.959 --> 08:06.291
yes, no,

08:06.375 --> 08:08.667
and yes, if I've been drinking.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.041
Come here, wonder bread.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.667
What's up, doll?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.250
If you ever get this close again,

08:13.333 --> 08:14.625
I will end you.

08:14.709 --> 08:18.166
I'm changing you to a yes
because you're feisty.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.083
Carla, I'm sorry.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.083
For him?
Not your fault.

08:22.875 --> 08:25.375
No. I'm talking about us.
I'm sorry for what I did wrong.

08:25.458 --> 08:26.625
Which was?

08:27.709 --> 08:28.542
You know.

08:28.625 --> 08:31.125
See, you don't even realize
why I'm upset. That--

08:31.208 --> 08:32.417
Why are you smiling?

08:32.500 --> 08:34.583
Because I set your ass up.

08:35.375 --> 08:38.709
Baby, I should've told you
how Cox felt about you,

08:38.792 --> 08:40.750
and I was wrong for talking
behind your back,

08:40.834 --> 08:42.792
which is a violation of the trust

08:42.875 --> 08:44.417
our relationship is based on.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.041
And that is why I'm sorry.

08:46.125 --> 08:48.041
My boy's got mad apologizing
skills.

08:48.125 --> 08:49.417
Todd, not now.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.667
You can't just point out the obvious.

08:52.750 --> 08:55.709
You have to go deeper, and, Todd,
if you say, "that's what she said,"

08:55.792 --> 08:57.375
I will brain you.

08:58.250 --> 09:00.875
Now, come on, baby.
Connect with me.

09:00.959 --> 09:02.458
Why am I really upset?

09:04.125 --> 09:06.834
I'm gonna stick with the violation
of trust thing. Final answer.

09:09.792 --> 09:10.959
Yeah, right.

09:11.041 --> 09:12.625
Ohh.

09:14.750 --> 09:17.125
You know, I got half a mind
to ask her out.

09:18.208 --> 09:19.583
Too soon?

09:23.208 --> 09:26.208
Well, thanks for the loaners, Chet.

09:26.291 --> 09:27.208
Don't stain them.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.125

<i>you get a decent locker.</i>

09:31.208 --> 09:34.125

09:36.083 --> 09:37.208

09:37.291 --> 09:39.500
Dude, that was, like, some sort of record
or something.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.875
Sorry, mom. It's just that it's gotten
really awkward

09:44.000 --> 09:46.291
with this guy that I was seeing, and...

09:46.375 --> 09:48.875
Yes, mom.
Yay, I'm straight.

09:48.959 --> 09:50.417
Look, I just-- I don't know what to do.

09:50.500 --> 09:52.917
I mean, every time I see him,
I get so embarrassed

09:53.000 --> 09:56.458
and lonely and mortified,

09:56.542 --> 09:59.208
and I guess I was just
hoping that you could...

10:00.250 --> 10:03.417
Um, about 115 pounds.

10:04.834 --> 10:06.792
Phen-phen kills people, mom.

10:08.125 --> 10:11.375
Because I'm a doctor.
That's how I know.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.083
-(Cox) You look pretty today.
-Don't even start with me.

10:15.166 --> 10:16.417
You look horrible?

10:16.500 --> 10:17.792
I look fantastic,

10:17.875 --> 10:19.375
and what you're doing,
that's starting.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.417
I'm pretty sure
I said not to start. Laverne?

10:21.500 --> 10:22.542
That's what she said.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.750
<i>Así que no empiezas,</i> okay?

10:27.333 --> 10:29.291
That's "don't start" in Spanish.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.542
<i>Bueno.</i>

10:30.625 --> 10:32.625
(J.D.) <i>I had planned</i>
<i>to avoid Dr. Cox all day,</i>

10:32.709 --> 10:34.834
<i>but unfortunately, I needed his help.</i>

10:34.917 --> 10:37.291
Dr. Cox, I have this patient, Mr. Zerbo.
Can't quite figure out--

10:37.375 --> 10:38.667
-(whistles)
-(J.D.) <i>Who knows?</i>

10:38.750 --> 10:41.375
<i>Maybe he just decided to let</i>
<i>the whole ex-wife thing go.</i>

10:41.458 --> 10:43.750
-Autoimmune serologies?
-All negative.

10:43.834 --> 10:46.417
(J.D.) <i>Then again, maybe he's just</i>
<i>letting me stew for a while.</i>

10:46.500 --> 10:48.875
-Bone marrow biopsy?
-Negative.

10:48.959 --> 10:51.542
(J.D.) <i>What kind of man</i>
<i>tortures people like this?</i>

10:51.625 --> 10:53.125
'Fraid you got yourself a toughie.

10:54.166 --> 10:55.959
Okay, fine!
I'm sorry I slept with your ex-wife!

10:56.041 --> 10:57.959
(tires screech sound effect)

10:58.041 --> 11:01.834
(theme song from <i>Twilight Zone)</i>

11:03.583 --> 11:05.834
I think I'll sit back down.

11:06.333 --> 11:07.834
It was an accident.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.709
Look. First of all,

11:09.792 --> 11:12.625
it's not like you tripped
and fell into her and then out of her

11:12.709 --> 11:15.083
and then into her again.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.875
And second of all,
you're smart enough to know

11:16.959 --> 11:18.166
that I don't want to talk about this.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.041
I don't want to know where you did it.

11:20.125 --> 11:22.333
I don't even want to know how it was.

11:22.417 --> 11:25.041
A little scary. It's like, "jitters."

11:25.125 --> 11:27.208
(J.D.)
<i>Here come the fireworks.</i>

11:27.291 --> 11:28.709
Look it,

11:29.500 --> 11:31.583
I know you didn't have any idea
who she was

11:31.667 --> 11:33.959
and I understand
why you were too nervous to tell me,

11:34.041 --> 11:35.959
so what do you say we leave it at that?

11:36.041 --> 11:39.291
I forgive you. You are forgiven, okay?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.041
Damn.

11:44.792 --> 11:46.750
(J.D.) <i>Hospitals aren't</i>
<i>as big as you think.</i>

11:46.834 --> 11:49.458
<i>Eventually, you run into everyone.</i>

11:49.542 --> 11:50.959
Hey, Elliot.

11:51.542 --> 11:54.750
I'm not--I'm not hiding. Um, I just--I was
just looking for my, um,

11:54.834 --> 11:56.333
you know, the--

11:57.125 --> 11:59.542
I was looking for my dignity.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.125
Did you find it?

12:01.208 --> 12:02.458
No.

12:05.250 --> 12:07.000
I must've left it at college.

12:07.083 --> 12:09.667
(J.D.) <i>Oh, for god's sakes,</i>
would you throw her a rope?

12:10.667 --> 12:12.834
I have no idea
how to treat this patient.

12:12.917 --> 12:13.834
Help me out.

12:13.917 --> 12:15.709
(J.D.) <i>Now, she's in a really</i>
<i>awkward place,</i>

12:15.792 --> 12:17.667
<i>so just be sensitive.</i>

12:17.750 --> 12:19.041
I think we should sex each other.

12:19.125 --> 12:20.959
-I'm sorry?
-Just hear me out.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.291
Our relationship ended so quickly.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.041
Maybe too quickly, you know?

12:25.125 --> 12:28.542
And now there's, like,
these feelings floating around,

12:28.625 --> 12:30.542
and I feel like we're
always gonna regret it

12:30.625 --> 12:33.375
if we don't see
if they lead somewhere.

12:35.542 --> 12:36.458
What do you think?

12:37.250 --> 12:39.792
I can't believe how weird it feels
to be back here again.

12:39.875 --> 12:43.166
Yeah, but it seems so right.

12:44.500 --> 12:45.583
If Carla's so mad,

12:45.667 --> 12:47.792
I don't understand why she just doesn't
just crash at her own place.

12:47.875 --> 12:50.166
Oh, she is back at her place.

12:50.250 --> 12:52.125
What are you talking about, Willis?

12:52.208 --> 12:53.917
Heh. Pretty funny.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.083
-We should make that one of our things.
-Yeah, I know.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.500
That's stupid.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.041
I think I'd really panic
if she went back to her place.

13:03.625 --> 13:06.041
J.D., this sucks.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.792
Yeah. You know what's weird, though,

13:07.875 --> 13:10.709
it's like Dr. Cox and I
are pretty vegan kosher.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.917
-He hasn't yelled at you?
-No.

13:13.041 --> 13:15.125
This is the guy that screamed on you
for, like, 20 minutes

13:15.208 --> 13:16.709
for dropping a thermometer,

13:16.792 --> 13:19.583
and he hasn't raised his voice once about
you bumping uglies with his ex-wife?

13:19.667 --> 13:20.750
Uh-uh.

13:21.709 --> 13:22.917
I don't get that guy.

13:24.458 --> 13:26.250
(J.D.) <i>And that's when</i>
<i>I realized something.</i>

13:28.291 --> 13:30.458
Hey, where ya been?
I paged you twice.

13:30.542 --> 13:32.542
Um, I must've misplaced my pager.

13:32.625 --> 13:36.500
(J.D.) <i>The reason Dr. Cox wasn't</i>
<i>yelling at me like he used to...</i>

13:36.583 --> 13:38.166
Probably ought
to try and find that.

13:40.375 --> 13:42.083
(J.D.) <i>He didn't care about me anymore.</i>

13:45.208 --> 13:47.667
Yup. It's a leaky oil ring.

13:47.750 --> 13:49.041
I can fix her,

13:49.125 --> 13:51.792
but I don't got the parts in stock.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.208
We need an oil ring
down there.

13:53.291 --> 13:55.208
Ha ha ha!

13:55.291 --> 13:56.834
That's entertainment.

14:03.583 --> 14:07.166
(J.D.) <i>Standing there, I couldn't help</i>
<i>thinking about the way things used to be.</i>

14:07.250 --> 14:09.208
Don't forget, Felicia,

14:09.291 --> 14:13.792
if you flake on me,
you're finished!

14:15.625 --> 14:18.709
Son, you know, you really ought to
buy that thing dinner first.

14:23.583 --> 14:26.417
(J.D.) <i>And it wasn't</i>
<i>just me and Dr. Cox.</i>

14:27.792 --> 14:30.291
<i>Everyone was just drifting</i>
<i>through the halls,</i>

14:30.375 --> 14:33.959
<i>each one of us acting like</i>
<i>the others didn't exist.</i>

14:36.583 --> 14:38.500
<i>That's when I decided</i>
<i>to get proactive,</i>

14:38.583 --> 14:40.375
<i>and I knew just where to start.</i>

14:40.458 --> 14:42.291
<i>What the bejesus?</i>

14:42.375 --> 14:43.375
Hello, boys.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.166
What the hell are you doing?

14:45.250 --> 14:47.458
This is how the Todd gets
his self-esteem on.

14:48.709 --> 14:49.709
Do these help?

14:49.792 --> 14:52.125
-(imitates fart)
-Uncool.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.083
You look totally hot,
mirror Todd.

14:58.208 --> 15:01.250
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.792
You know, Elliot, I think we should
talk about the sexual tension.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.709
There is no sexual tension, okay?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.250
Just go ahead and look
before your neck snaps.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.333
Awesome.

15:15.417 --> 15:17.250
J.D., the problem is this place.

15:17.333 --> 15:19.458
You know, when we broke up,
I had to see you the next day.

15:19.542 --> 15:20.875
And the next day.

15:20.959 --> 15:23.291
You know, I never got any distance
from the relationship.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.583
I never got to move on, you know?

15:25.667 --> 15:27.500
And the sexual tension.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.542
Oh, my god. You have no idea
what you sound like, do you?

15:35.375 --> 15:39.208
J.D., J.D. Check it.
Rat tail!

15:39.291 --> 15:42.125
Yah! Yah! Yah!

15:42.208 --> 15:43.500
You don't want to play?

15:44.959 --> 15:46.959
Ha! Too slow!

15:47.041 --> 15:49.250
What now, Mr. Smart guy?

15:49.333 --> 15:50.917
(squeaks)

15:52.125 --> 15:56.458
-That is so not funny.
-Ha ha ha! Wet butt.

15:57.834 --> 15:59.583
It gets better.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.667
-Is it starting to burn?
-I would think so.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.542
Hey, uh, don't touch your eyes.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.667
(J.D.) <i>Okay, right back on the horse.</i>

16:08.750 --> 16:10.458
First off, I'd like to thank you all
for agreeing to talk.

16:10.542 --> 16:12.500
-Bambi, you paged us here.
-Be that as it may,

16:12.583 --> 16:14.083
I think there are some simple solutions.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.333
-Dr. Cox, you're angry with me.
-No, I'm not.

16:16.417 --> 16:17.625
And you won't admit this,
but you're in love with Carla.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.625
-No, he's not.
-Actually, I am.

16:19.709 --> 16:20.583
You're starting again.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.959
And, Carla, you're mad that Turk
didn't trust you enough to tell you.

16:23.041 --> 16:24.542
See? Trust, woman. Trust.

16:24.625 --> 16:25.917
(J.D.) Whatever.
The point is, Turk is sorry.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.750
-Not anymore.
-I can't believe you thought

16:27.834 --> 16:29.500
-he was a threat.
-I'm a threat.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.250
You're not in love with me.
You idealize me.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.000
(J.D.) If we could just
try and stay focused.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.500
You're mad 'cause
I'm scared of losing you?

16:34.583 --> 16:36.125
Yes, because we're
stronger than that.

16:36.208 --> 16:38.834
<i>♪ Apparently not ♪</i>

16:38.917 --> 16:41.500
You should be glad I never took our
relationship for granted, you silly woman.

16:41.583 --> 16:43.083
If we could just refrain
from name-calling.

16:43.166 --> 16:45.083
-Oprah's right.
-Lay off of him!

16:45.166 --> 16:46.917
You're just pissed because
you're still in love with your ex.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.500
Okay, that's it!

16:49.375 --> 16:52.000
Now, I'd kill for so much less than that,
and I'll damn sure do it again

16:52.083 --> 16:54.000
unless you all shut the hell up
right now,

16:54.083 --> 16:55.917
and I mean now!

17:01.583 --> 17:02.583
Aren't you glad
we did this?

17:02.667 --> 17:04.875
I'm going out for Mexican food
tonight,

17:04.959 --> 17:07.625
and I'll see you in bed,
my friend.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.625
(pager beeps)

17:10.709 --> 17:12.583
Oh, my god. Rounds.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.333
(J.D.) <i>Rounds started</i>
<i>5 minutes ago,</i>

17:14.417 --> 17:15.875

<i>about Mr. Zerbo.</i>

17:15.959 --> 17:18.125
<i>Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god.</i>

17:18.208 --> 17:19.625
Unh.

17:21.208 --> 17:24.000
Are you planning on
making this worth my while?

17:24.750 --> 17:25.792
Ow.

17:27.500 --> 17:31.667
Dr. Dorian, how about you step up
to the mike and tell the entire gang

17:31.750 --> 17:33.792
how you ended up treating Mr. Zerbo?

17:33.875 --> 17:35.834
(J.D.) <i>Think, whiz kid, think.</i>

17:37.250 --> 17:39.417
<i>Ah, hell with it.</i>

17:39.500 --> 17:40.500
Sir, I did nothing.

17:40.583 --> 17:43.000
(theme song from <i>Twilight Zone)</i>

17:44.667 --> 17:47.667
Is this because
of the same kid as before?

17:49.709 --> 17:51.500
You did nothing?

17:51.583 --> 17:53.083
Nothing at all.

17:58.208 --> 17:59.709
Great job, sport.

18:00.917 --> 18:03.375
Whenever a patient
gets bounced from ward to ward,

18:03.458 --> 18:05.750
there's always a chance
a high fever could be sustained

18:05.834 --> 18:09.375
or even caused by the constant stream
of different antibiotics.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.250
It's called drug fever,

18:11.333 --> 18:13.542
and it's a good catch by Dr. Dorian.

18:14.417 --> 18:15.291
Next patient.

18:15.375 --> 18:19.542
Mush, people. Mush!
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

18:21.250 --> 18:22.625
Thank you, doctor.

18:23.750 --> 18:24.917
Oh, no problem.

Did you know how I know
that this is yours, Farrah?

19:47.709 --> 19:48.834
'Cause when I paged you earlier,

19:48.917 --> 19:50.917
someone found it next to a can of fresca

19:51.000 --> 19:53.291
and a dog-eared copy
of <i>Teen People</i> magazine.

19:53.417 --> 19:55.500
Anyway, long story short,

19:55.583 --> 19:57.208
the whole incident gave me a bang-up idea,

19:57.291 --> 19:59.500
because, you see, I've got tomorrow off.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.959
So I'm gonna be on my couch
sipping on some scotch

20:02.041 --> 20:03.709
and paging you every 20 seconds,

20:03.792 --> 20:05.417
and if you don't answer
every damn last one of 'em,

20:05.500 --> 20:07.375
I'm gonna show this thing
so far down your throat,

20:07.458 --> 20:09.917
it's gonna make you take a tinkle
every time it goes off.

20:11.375 --> 20:13.291
Big fun, right?

20:13.375 --> 20:14.959
