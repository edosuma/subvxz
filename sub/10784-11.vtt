20:08.333 --> 20:10.875
OH. YOU TWO KIDS
HAVE FUN NOW,

20:10.875 --> 20:12.458
AND HAVE HER HOME
BY MIDNIGHT,

20:12.458 --> 20:14.208
OR SHE'LL TURN
INTO A PUMPKIN.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.041
OK,
I WILL, I PROMISE.

20:16.041 --> 20:17.458
I'LL TAKE
GOOD CARE OF HER.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.959
SHE LIKES YOU.

20:21.959 --> 20:23.834
NOT-- NOT A GOOD SIGN.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.500
OH, REALLY?

20:25.500 --> 20:27.834
I-- YOU KNOW, UM,
IT'S KINDA CHILLY.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.542
MAYBE I SHOULD
GO GET MY JACKET.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.500
WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE'RE NOT GOING THAT FAR--
JUST ABOUT A HUNDRED FEET.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.000
REALLY?
WHERE ARE WE GOING?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.333
DAWSON'S.
HE'S HAVING A SEANCE.
WON'T THAT BE KILLER?

20:39.083 --> 20:43.125
HMM. IT'S A NICE HOUSE.

20:44.375 --> 20:45.667
OH! CARAMEL CORN.

20:45.667 --> 20:46.875

20:46.875 --> 20:50.250

20:53.917 --> 20:55.500

20:55.500 --> 20:56.708
TOO EASY.

20:56.708 --> 20:57.917
OH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
I LOVE TO BE SCARED.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.959
MY BOYFRIEND, EDDIE,
SCARES THE GOOP OUTTA ME.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.875
I CAN IMAGINE.

21:02.875 --> 21:05.000
I NEED A DRINK.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.667
EVERYBODY
HELP YOURSELF.

21:09.458 --> 21:12.250
SO, UH, THANKS
FOR THE PHONE CALL.

21:12.250 --> 21:13.291
WHAT PHONE CALL?

21:13.291 --> 21:14.750

TO CALL YOU?

21:14.750 --> 21:17.542
YEAH. AND THE NOTE
IN MY LOCKER. NICE TOUCH.

21:17.542 --> 21:20.417

A BIT HARSH, BUT YOU DO
STRIVE FOR REALISM.

21:20.417 --> 21:21.542
WHAT NOTE?
WHAT PHONE CALL?

21:21.542 --> 21:24.000
OH, COME ON,
DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME.

21:24.000 --> 21:25.000
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO SCARE ME.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.375
NO, I'M NOT.
WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

21:26.375 --> 21:29.083
BECAUSE IT'S--IT'S
WHAT YOU DO.

21:29.083 --> 21:30.542
IT'S FRIDAY THE 13TH.

21:30.542 --> 21:33.458
YEAH, BUT, JEN,
THIS IS IT--
FAKE SNAKES.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.125
I'M SORRY I DIDN'T
PLAN ANYTHING
SPECIFIC FOR YOU.

21:36.125 --> 21:38.333
I DIDN'T THINK
YOU'D GET INTO IT.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.708
HMM. OK.

21:43.708 --> 21:44.250
NOTHING HERE.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.291

21:46.291 --> 21:48.542
IT'S NOT COLD, SO WE'LL
HAVE TO ADD SOME ICE.

21:48.542 --> 21:51.333
AAH!

21:56.125 --> 21:59.291
IT'S LIKE
A FUN HOUSE IN HERE.

22:01.917 --> 22:04.208

YOU GET THE SEANCE BOOK?

22:04.208 --> 22:05.583
IT'S IN THE HALL CLOSET.

22:10.834 --> 22:12.875
HEY, MAN, THANKS
FOR HAVING ME OVER.
THIS IS PERFECT.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.875
YOU THINK?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.750
THE MOST ORIGINAL
FIRST DATE I CAN THINK OF.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.208
HOW MANY GUYS
WOULD BRING A GIRL

22:18.208 --> 22:19.208
TO THEIR
EX-BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE?

22:19.208 --> 22:21.500
IT'S CLASSIC.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.708
I THINK SHE'S REALLY
WARMIN' UP TO ME, MAN.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.166
CONGRATULATIONS.

22:26.166 --> 22:30.000
JOEY, IS IT JUST ME,
OR IS THIS TOO WEIRD
FOR WORDS?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.583
I MEAN, I'M ON A DATE,
AND I END UP HERE?

22:32.583 --> 22:34.250
COME ON.
WHOSE IDEA WAS THIS?

22:34.250 --> 22:35.458
CLIFF'S?

22:35.458 --> 22:37.667
NO, NO. HE'S NOT
THAT INVENTIVE.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.917
THIS IS DEFINITELY
THE WORK OF DAWSON.

22:39.917 --> 22:42.000
YA THINK?

22:42.000 --> 22:44.708
AAH!
AAH!

22:53.250 --> 22:58.041
SPIRITS...ARE YOU WITH US?

22:58.041 --> 23:02.667
WHOOOAAHH...SPIRITS,
COME TO US. WHOOO.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.417
URSULA, ARE YOU, LIKE,
A SPIRIT GODDESS?

23:04.417 --> 23:06.041
WELL, I CHANNEL
FROM TIME TO TIME.

23:06.041 --> 23:08.166
I HAVE A COUPLE
OF SISTER SPIRITS THAT
OCCUPY MY BODY OCCASIONALLY.

23:08.166 --> 23:10.542
DIONNE AND LATOYA?

23:10.542 --> 23:11.959
PACEY: YOU KNOW
WHAT WE SHOULD DO?

23:11.959 --> 23:15.083
WE SHOULD CHANNEL
THE VICTIM
OF THE LADY KILLER.

23:15.083 --> 23:16.500
MAYBE THEY'D I.D.
THE GUY.

23:16.500 --> 23:18.834
WE COULD GET
THAT REWARD MONEY.
THAT'D BE SWEET.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.959
DID YOU GUYS KNOW
HE LIKES TO STALK
HIS VICTIMS?

23:20.959 --> 23:23.875
USUALLY COMING
IN CONTACT FIRST THROUGH
NOTES AND PHONE CALLS.

23:23.875 --> 23:25.625
REALLY?
YEAH.

23:25.625 --> 23:27.750
THAT'S HOW HE GOT THAT GIRL
DOWN IN NORTH CAROLINA.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.667
HE SENT HER NOTES
AND THEN FOLLOWED HER HOME
FROM SCHOOL ONE DAY.

23:30.667 --> 23:32.875
THEN HE PEEKED
THROUGH HER WINDOW.

23:32.875 --> 23:35.250
AND THEN HE CALLED,
PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

23:35.250 --> 23:38.375
THAT'S CREEPY. YOU GOT
A CALL, DIDN'T YOU?

23:38.375 --> 23:39.750
SOMEBODY CALLED YOU?

23:39.750 --> 23:41.667
YES, AND HIS NAME
IS DAWSON.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.583
JEN, I SWEAR
I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

23:43.583 --> 23:46.125
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T
YOU FINISH THE STORY?

23:46.125 --> 23:47.166
BUT YOU DON'T LIKE
SCARY STUFF.

23:47.166 --> 23:50.291
I HAVE A CONTRADICTING
PERSONALITY.

23:51.333 --> 23:52.458
PLEASE CONTINUE.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.333
OK.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.041
SO ANYWAY,
SO HE CALLED HER

23:55.041 --> 23:58.083
AND LEARNED THAT
SHE WAS GOING TO BE
HOME THAT NIGHT.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.834
NOW, SHE LIVED
IN A TOWN WHERE NOBODY
LOCKED THEIR DOORS.

24:00.834 --> 24:04.083
HE DISCONNECTED
HER ELECTRICITY,
CUT OFF HER PHONE,

24:04.083 --> 24:06.625
WALKED RIGHT THROUGH
THE FRONT DOOR,
UP HER STAIRS,

24:06.625 --> 24:07.750
INTO HER BEDROOM
WHILE SHE WAS SLEEPING,

24:07.750 --> 24:11.792
AND CUT OUT HER HEART
IN ONE, CLEAN SWEEP.

24:11.792 --> 24:12.917
UGH.

24:12.917 --> 24:14.667
HE USES A LONG,
LACERATING SCALPEL,

24:14.667 --> 24:15.792
SO THEY THINK HE MIGHT BE
A DOCTOR OR SOMETHING.

24:15.792 --> 24:18.208
YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES
THAT STORY SO SCARY?

24:18.208 --> 24:19.750
IT'S TRUE.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.625
YOU THINK
STUFF LIKE THAT
NEVER HAPPENS,

24:21.625 --> 24:23.500
BUT THEN
IT ALWAYS DOES.

24:23.500 --> 24:25.458
I'VE GOT A STORY.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.166
IT'S TRUE, TOO.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.417
A WOMAN WITH A NEWBORN
GOES OUT TO THE COUNTRY
TO PICK BLUEBERRIES.

24:30.417 --> 24:33.208
AND SHE LEAVES
THE BABY IN THE BACK
IN HIS LITTLE CAR SEAT,

24:33.208 --> 24:35.834
WITH THE DOOR OPEN
SO SHE CAN HEAR HIM
IF HE CRIES.

24:35.834 --> 24:37.792
SHE GOES OUT PICKING
IN THE BLUEBERRY PATCH,

24:37.792 --> 24:39.250
AND AFTER ABOUT
A HALF AN HOUR,

24:39.250 --> 24:41.708
SHE REALIZES
SHE HASN'T HEARD A PEEP
FROM THE BABY.

24:41.708 --> 24:43.625
UH-OH.

24:43.625 --> 24:46.208
SHE RUNS
BACK TO THE CAR,
LOOKS IN THE BACK.

24:46.208 --> 24:49.166
A HUGE SNAKE HAS CRAWLED
DOWN THE THROAT
OF THE BABY,

24:49.166 --> 24:52.834
ITS TAIL WAGGING OUT.

24:52.834 --> 24:55.417
SO IN MAJOR SHOCK,
SHE REACHES IN,

24:55.417 --> 24:57.750
YANKS THE SNAKE OUT,
AND ALONG WITH IT,

24:57.750 --> 25:00.417
COMES ALL THE BABY'S
INSIDES.

25:00.417 --> 25:02.959
THAT'S NOT SCARY.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

25:02.959 --> 25:04.333
IT'S NASTY.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.583
POOR BABY.

25:07.333 --> 25:09.750
I HAVE A SCARY STORY.

25:09.750 --> 25:13.166
THERE'S THIS YOUNG KID,
THIS BOY,

25:13.166 --> 25:15.917
WHO GOES
TO THIS CONVENIENCE STORE
AND PICKS UP THIS WOMAN.

25:15.917 --> 25:18.208
SHE'S WILD, YOU KNOW,
A LITTLE CRAZY.

25:18.208 --> 25:20.291
BUT PRETTY.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.625
AND HE TAKES HER BACK
TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE,

25:22.625 --> 25:24.875
WHERE THEY'RE HAVING ALL THESE,
LIKE, FUN AND GAMES.

25:24.875 --> 25:27.291
AND WHAT NONE OF THEM KNOW
IS THAT THIS WOMAN

25:27.291 --> 25:29.750
IS A LITTLE ILL--

25:29.750 --> 25:30.708
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
IN THE HEAD,

25:30.708 --> 25:35.000

OF ABUSE--

25:35.000 --> 25:37.333
AND THAT, IN HER PURSE,

25:37.333 --> 25:41.667
SHE CARRIES
THIS GREAT, BIG KNIFE...

25:41.667 --> 25:42.792
BECAUSE SOMETIMES,

25:42.792 --> 25:44.875
JUST FOR FUN,

25:44.875 --> 25:46.917
SHE LIKES
TO SLICE OPEN THROATS

25:46.917 --> 25:50.417
AND SEE HOW FAR
THE BLOOD WILL SPURT.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.417
HEH...

25:59.208 --> 26:01.834
[ALL SCREAMING]

26:04.583 --> 26:07.208

THIS FREAKS ME OUT.

26:07.208 --> 26:08.875
DAWSON, TURN
THE LIGHTS BACK ON.

26:08.875 --> 26:10.667
IT WASN'T ME.
IT MUST BE A BLACKOUT.

26:10.667 --> 26:11.542
REALLY? A BLACKOUT
DURING OUR SEANCE.

26:11.542 --> 26:13.875
HOW COINCIDENTAL,
DAWSON.

26:13.875 --> 26:17.333
YEAH. I THINK I'LL CALL
THE ELECTRICAL COMPANY.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.542
WELL, IMAGINE THAT.
THE PHONE'S DEAD.

26:23.542 --> 26:24.500
DON'T LOOK AT ME. I--

26:24.500 --> 26:26.458
GREAT! NO PHONES,
NO ELECTRICITY.

26:26.458 --> 26:27.458
MAYBE IT'S
THE LADY KILLER.

26:27.458 --> 26:29.542
MAYBE IT'S DOOFUS DAWSON!

26:29.542 --> 26:32.417

'CAUSE I'M GETTIN'
A LITTLE SPOOKED HERE.

26:32.417 --> 26:33.375

26:33.375 --> 26:34.417

26:34.417 --> 26:36.250

26:38.083 --> 26:40.208

YOU GOING?

26:42.625 --> 26:44.208

39:49.041 --> 39:50.875
[SNAP]
OH!

39:56.625 --> 39:59.291
WHAT IS IT, DEAR?

39:59.291 --> 40:02.583
OH, UM...

40:02.583 --> 40:05.166
ACTUALLY, GRAMS,
IT'S FOR YOU.

40:05.166 --> 40:06.834
GOOD NIGHT.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.000
GRAMS: OOH!

40:13.000 --> 40:16.041
HA HA. I SCARED YOU
PRETTY BAD WITH THIS BABY.

40:16.041 --> 40:19.417
YEAH, BUT NOT AS BAD
AS I SCARED YOU.

40:19.417 --> 40:20.542
I WASN'T SCARED.

40:20.542 --> 40:22.083
I SAW THE LOOK
ON YOUR FACE

40:22.083 --> 40:26.250
WHEN YOU SAW ME TUMBLE
OUT OF THE CLOSET.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.834
I DON'T KNOW.

40:28.834 --> 40:30.542
I THOUGHT MAYBE
FOR A SECOND

40:30.542 --> 40:33.959
YOU MIGHT EVEN...
BE SAD IF I DIED.

40:35.375 --> 40:38.458
JOEY, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

40:38.458 --> 40:39.875
YOU WOULDN'T BE SAD?

40:39.875 --> 40:42.625
THANKS.

40:42.625 --> 40:46.542
ARE YOU KIDDING? GOD,
I WOULD BE INCONSOLABLE.

40:48.125 --> 40:49.458
JOEY...

40:49.458 --> 40:53.000
IF YOU DIED, GOD, I...

40:53.000 --> 40:56.917
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WOULD DO.

40:56.917 --> 41:00.417
THAT'S THE WORST
POSSIBLE THING
I COULD IMAGINE.

41:07.125 --> 41:09.000
WHAT ABOUT ME?

41:11.500 --> 41:14.500
WOULD YOU SHED ANY TEARS
IF I DIED?

41:24.291 --> 41:26.500
SO YA SLEEPIN' OVER?

41:28.458 --> 41:30.083
DO YA MIND?

41:30.083 --> 41:32.875
I DON'T KNOW.
ALL THIS MAYHEM HAS
REALLY SPOOKED ME OUT.

41:32.875 --> 41:35.083
IT WAS FUN, THOUGH,
WASN'T IT?

41:35.083 --> 41:37.542
YEAH, BUT FRIDAY
THE 13TH'S OVER,

41:37.542 --> 41:40.500
SO NO MORE BRUSHES
WITH DEATH, OK?

41:40.500 --> 41:42.625
CAN WE JUST GO TO SLEEP

41:42.625 --> 41:45.166
AND PRETEND THE WORLD'S
A SAFE AND HAPPY PLACE TO LIVE?

41:45.166 --> 41:46.708
