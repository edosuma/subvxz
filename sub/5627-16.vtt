Previously on Criminal Minds.
-

00:09.290 --> 00:11.290
Don't tell me you got another case.

00:11.290 --> 00:12.830
No, no, no. Baby, I'm coming home.

00:12.830 --> 00:15.330
-I swear, I'm coming home.
-Good. Me, too.

00:17.210 --> 00:18.580
No!-What's wrong?

00:18.830 --> 00:21.330
- -Derek, are you there?

00:21.830 --> 00:23.380
What's wrong?

01:42.250 --> 01:43.290
Wake him up.

01:45.290 --> 01:46.330
He is awake.

01:50.420 --> 01:51.460
What's he doing?

01:59.750 --> 02:03.000
He's dissociating himself from the pain
he knows we're going to inflict.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.080
Outstanding.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.500
Hello, hello, hello!

02:25.500 --> 02:27.620
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Daddy's home!

02:27.620 --> 02:29.000
Daddy's home!
-What?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.670
-Daddy!
-Wow, yes!

02:30.670 --> 02:33.000
Yes, yes, Daddy is home!

02:33.000 --> 02:34.670
Daddy is home.

02:34.670 --> 02:37.620
Look at you, my beautiful babies.
My beautiful babies!

02:37.620 --> 02:39.120
Oh, my...

02:40.960 --> 02:42.920
Good.

02:42.920 --> 02:44.750
Oh, wow, what do you got?

02:46.380 --> 02:48.500
-Did you make this all by yourself?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.330
For me? Oh, it's so good.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.830
It's so good.

02:53.580 --> 02:54.750
You're late.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.880
Daddy's in trouble.

02:56.880 --> 03:00.710
So you know what? It's time for dinner.
Gotta go wash 'em up. Go, go, go, go!

03:00.710 --> 03:01.960
You promised.

03:04.920 --> 03:06.670
Baby, it was work.

03:07.380 --> 03:08.540
You promised.

03:08.540 --> 03:12.500
Hey. Come on, now. Work is work.

03:12.500 --> 03:14.460
And work makes all of this work.

03:14.460 --> 03:17.000
Yeah, it works because
I put in a 10-hour shift

03:17.000 --> 03:19.210
and made it home to do
two sets of homework,

03:19.210 --> 03:21.120
give two baths, and cook for four.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.670
Woman, do you know how much I love you?

03:25.330 --> 03:28.000
How much I appreciate
everything that you do?

03:29.170 --> 03:30.670
How much?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.040
This much.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.120
Baby.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.290
What is it?

04:25.880 --> 04:26.960
Daddy's home.

04:33.290 --> 04:34.750
You're late.

04:35.380 --> 04:37.210
-Huh?
-You promised.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.460
You want to make it work, make this work.

04:39.460 --> 04:42.000
It works because I put in a 10-hour shift,

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
made it home to do two sets of homework,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.710
-give two baths, and cook for seven.
-Word.

04:46.710 --> 04:48.880
You say you'll be home for dinner,
be home for dinner.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.000
She was waiting on you, Derek.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.290
-Get home for dinner, Derek.
-Keep your word, Derek.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.620
Where are you

04:54.620 --> 04:56.040
I'm trying.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.920
I'm trying.

04:59.380 --> 05:00.790
I'm trying.

05:01.580 --> 05:04.210
Problem is, you're goin'
in the wrong direction.

05:29.210 --> 05:30.500
Can't avoid me forever.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.120
Do I know you?

05:39.920 --> 05:42.380
Come on. Let's go.

05:44.040 --> 05:46.420
I'm not going anywhere with you.

05:47.040 --> 05:49.210
We're not going anywhere bad.

05:49.920 --> 05:51.170
But we are going.

05:57.460 --> 05:58.750
Come on.

06:05.670 --> 06:07.500
His heart rate's back to baseline.

06:08.170 --> 06:09.210
Start a fire.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.080
Okay.

06:30.540 --> 06:31.880
I get it.

06:33.290 --> 06:34.620
I get it.

06:35.040 --> 06:38.380
You, this. This is all in my head, right?

06:38.380 --> 06:40.170
So I can survive what they're doing to me.

06:43.210 --> 06:44.580
Who are you?

06:46.170 --> 06:47.210
You want a hint?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.210
Dad?

07:50.250 --> 07:51.960
-What did you find?
-No sign of him.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.620
But they left this in his car
at the parking lot.

07:53.620 --> 07:54.750
Could Savannah tell us anything?

07:54.750 --> 07:56.790
She says she thought
she heard three attackers,

07:56.790 --> 07:59.250
and that Morgan sounded drugged
before they cut off the call.

07:59.250 --> 08:01.880
Then it's a coordinated, planned attack,
most likely professional.

08:01.880 --> 08:03.710
We did just take down
a network of online hitmen,

08:03.710 --> 08:05.290
but if this is blowback, why Morgan?

08:05.290 --> 08:07.460
Well, we have to assume
that we're all targeted.

08:07.460 --> 08:09.420
I've put protective details
on each of our families,

08:09.420 --> 08:10.670
but I want Savannah to stay here.

08:10.670 --> 08:12.080
How is she?

08:12.920 --> 08:14.710
She's being brave.

08:14.710 --> 08:16.120
And you know
what the worst part is?

08:16.380 --> 08:18.580
What?
-I live with a profiler.

08:18.580 --> 08:22.250
So I know things I shouldn't.

08:23.830 --> 08:28.000
Like if they... They wanted him dead,
he'd already be dead.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.040
Right?

08:30.120 --> 08:31.250
That's right.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.620
- -

08:34.080 --> 08:35.120
Garcia needs us.

08:37.920 --> 08:41.880
You can stay here.
Whatever we find out, we'll tell you.

08:55.670 --> 08:59.620
I know wherever you are, you can hear me.

09:01.620 --> 09:05.460
This is white phosphorus.

09:07.170 --> 09:10.920
Fortunately for you,
there's a high ignition point.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.880
So, uh, we have a few minutes.

09:15.670 --> 09:17.580
It's good to see you, son.

09:18.790 --> 09:20.830
Don't tell me you're not happy to see me.

09:21.880 --> 09:25.620
Yes. Of course I'm happy to see you.

09:26.290 --> 09:28.250
I just can't pretend
that I don't know what this is.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.380
That I'm just a figment
of your imagination?

09:30.380 --> 09:33.080
-Yeah.
-Maybe I'm here

09:33.080 --> 09:36.380
because you're gonna die,
and I'll make it less scary.

09:37.040 --> 09:40.210
Or maybe I'm here to help you hang on.

09:40.210 --> 09:43.120
Or maybe I'm a cop and you're a profiler,

09:43.120 --> 09:46.290
and I can help you understand
how you got here.

09:46.290 --> 09:51.120
I don't know how I got here.
I don't recognize those men.

09:51.120 --> 09:55.250
When you start a case,
what's the first thing you look at?

09:55.790 --> 09:57.250
Victimology.

09:58.210 --> 09:59.920
Who's the victim?

10:00.420 --> 10:02.460
-Me.
-Hmm.

10:02.460 --> 10:05.040
We start there.
But here's the trick.

10:06.420 --> 10:11.460
You want to make sense of this.
So you gotta start from the beginning.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.380
You gotta go way back.

10:13.620 --> 10:17.040
-Where do we start?
-November 7, 1985.

10:20.290 --> 10:22.790
- -This is the block Derek was taken from.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.670
That blue dot is him.

10:24.670 --> 10:27.540
23, we lose him.

10:27.540 --> 10:30.250
So I checked all the other
cell signals in the area.

10:30.250 --> 10:33.500
They're all legit, aside from one
that I was only able to find

10:33.500 --> 10:35.880
thanks to some technology no one
outside this room needs to know about.

10:35.880 --> 10:37.580
-What is that?
-An encrypted signal, most likely

10:37.580 --> 10:38.710
bouncing off a satellite.

10:38.710 --> 10:40.960
I know we're thinking this would be tied
to our darknet investigation,

10:40.960 --> 10:42.830
but satellite encryption
is much higher-end technology

10:42.830 --> 10:43.960
than most online crime.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.830
That's true,
but the hitmen are still our best lead.

10:45.830 --> 10:48.790
We need to exhaust that
before we move on to other theories.

10:48.790 --> 10:52.040
JJ, you and Garcia will take
an armed agent to Savannah's house

10:52.040 --> 10:53.880
and get her to pack a bag.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.790
Yes, sir. Absolutely. But why me?

10:55.790 --> 10:57.420
Because while she gathers her things,

10:57.420 --> 10:59.000
we're going to see
if they were under surveillance.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.880
Whoever's behind this has been
planning this for weeks, if not months.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.210
We have no time to catch up. Let's move.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.880
He's gonna be okay.

11:13.210 --> 11:15.290
He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be okay.

11:15.290 --> 11:17.210
He's gonna be okay.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.080
Penelope, he's gonna be okay.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.040
He's gonna be okay, he's gonna be okay,

11:21.040 --> 11:22.750
he's gonna be okay, he's gonna be okay.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.460
This isn't the first time
I've done this.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.080
But it will be the most
that I've enjoyed it.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.210
How am I supposed to do this, Pop?

11:42.420 --> 11:45.790
You know how.
You do it with witnesses all the time.

11:45.790 --> 11:48.290
Cognitive interview.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.880
That's the one.

11:50.750 --> 11:54.540
Oh, man. You know how many
knuckleheads I could have put away

11:54.540 --> 11:56.710
if I had your training?

11:57.420 --> 12:01.120
The question is,
can you apply that training to yourself?

12:02.960 --> 12:06.000
Go ahead, Derek. Do it.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.170
It was November 7th.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.040
I was in the fifth grade
and I started throwing up

12:20.040 --> 12:22.000
in the middle of math class.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.540
Mom was at work, so you had to pick me up.

12:25.540 --> 12:28.380
You were mad.
You thought I was faking.

12:28.380 --> 12:31.790
Can you blame me?
You faked out of school before.

12:31.790 --> 12:34.710
You take that state capitals test?

12:34.710 --> 12:37.330
-Yeah.
-How'd you do?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.000
Got 'em all, I think.

12:40.540 --> 12:43.750
Mmm-hmm. What's the capital of Nevada?

12:43.750 --> 12:47.120
-Carson City.
-Oh. So close.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.580
-It's Las Vegas.
-Nuh-uh.

12:49.580 --> 12:52.830
The judges have spoken.
It is Las Vegas.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.750
It's Carson City.

12:58.290 --> 13:01.040
-You want anything from the store

13:01.920 --> 13:03.290
One Gatorade coming up.

13:06.380 --> 13:07.750
Dad, stop!

13:10.540 --> 13:13.830
This is 99-60.
We got a 212 at Marquette and Racine.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.710
You stay here. Keep your head down.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.920
Dad!

13:32.000 --> 13:33.250
Dad!

13:37.750 --> 13:40.790
I'll be okay. I'll be okay.

13:40.790 --> 13:43.000
Dad! No!

13:43.000 --> 13:45.330
I'll be okay.
- No!

13:47.620 --> 13:49.460
Only you weren't okay.

13:50.290 --> 13:53.380
Nothing was okay after that.

13:53.830 --> 13:57.670
You had to accept something
no one should have to accept.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.670
Especially at 10 years old.

14:01.920 --> 14:04.880
Which is that dads die.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.250
My death...

14:11.330 --> 14:12.580
Whose fault was it?

14:12.580 --> 14:14.210
The man who pulled the trigger.

14:14.210 --> 14:15.620
Yeah, him.

14:17.790 --> 14:18.920
But who else?

14:23.540 --> 14:25.330
Who do you blame?

14:29.880 --> 14:30.960
You.

14:33.460 --> 14:34.960
I blame you.

14:34.960 --> 14:38.080
If you want to be angry at me,
then be angry.

14:39.500 --> 14:40.540
I can take it.

14:40.830 --> 14:42.380
I'm not angry.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.670
-I never was.
-No?

14:45.120 --> 14:47.080
I blamed you for making me believe.

14:47.460 --> 14:48.580
Believe what?

14:53.210 --> 14:56.000
"'If I were to be made a knight,'
said Arthur,

14:56.710 --> 14:58.670
"'I should pray to God to let me encounter

14:58.670 --> 15:02.210
"'all the evil in the world
in my own person,

15:02.580 --> 15:05.580
"'so that if I conquered,
there would be none left.

15:06.080 --> 15:10.830
"'And if I were defeated,
I would be the one to suffer for it.'"

15:11.750 --> 15:14.120
It's getting late.
Your mama's gonna kill me.

15:14.120 --> 15:16.120
Oh, but it's just getting good.

15:16.420 --> 15:19.790
Wait till Lancelot shows up.
Then it really gets good.

15:19.790 --> 15:22.540
You're kind of like a knight,
aren't you, Dad?

15:22.540 --> 15:25.460
Eh. Never been on a horse before.

15:25.460 --> 15:28.960
But I have saved a damsel
in distress or two.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.170
Night.

15:30.790 --> 15:32.960
Are you protected by God like they were?

15:33.670 --> 15:36.120
Come on, now. Of course I am.

15:36.580 --> 15:38.380
Everyone with a badge is.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.210
Now go to sleep.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.500
That's why I told you
to stop the car.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.170
I thought if you helped that lady,
you'd be protected.

15:57.170 --> 15:59.040
I would have done it anyway.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.330
That's why I wasn't mad at you back then.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.210
But it's also when I had to start
figuring things out for myself.

16:05.210 --> 16:06.540
Like God.

16:07.500 --> 16:12.290
He doesn't stop bullets, Pop.
And he damn sure doesn't stop bad men.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.620
I'd have to do that myself.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.670
Fire in the hole!

16:31.670 --> 16:33.250
It's burning.

16:33.580 --> 16:36.380
Pop, it's burning!

16:37.920 --> 16:40.000
Son, listen to me.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.460
The man who's doing this
wants to break you.

16:43.920 --> 16:47.380
You hold out. He'll make a mistake.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.790
Will you stay
with me through this?

16:50.790 --> 16:51.960
Yes.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.210
-You promise?
-Yes.

16:56.960 --> 16:59.500
His heart rate's going back down.

17:00.460 --> 17:02.250
That's impossible.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.750
Cut him loose.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.880
Why?

17:08.710 --> 17:09.750
I want him naked.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.040
Wait for it.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.460
Wait for it.

17:25.540 --> 17:26.670
Now.

18:18.250 --> 18:19.290
Thanks.

18:20.290 --> 18:23.670
Hey, so I just talked to your neighbors.
They didn't see anything,

18:23.670 --> 18:26.120
and I didn't find
anything forensic outside.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.710
So, they weren't peeping on us
through our windows?

18:30.290 --> 18:31.880
Thank God for that, I guess.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.080
That leaves you, Penelope.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.540
I'm finishing my diagnostic now.
I think I have something.

18:40.710 --> 18:42.170
Do you have a wireless router on your DVR?

18:42.750 --> 18:44.830
-Uh, I think so.
-Okay.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.040
They used it as their back door.
And the encrypted phone call,

18:47.040 --> 18:49.380
this is the hacking version
of that same thing, and...

18:49.830 --> 18:52.120
Oh, man,
they were all up in your business.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.500
Was it the same UnSubs?

18:53.500 --> 18:56.830
My money says yes, but what's weird
is they used an intranet.

18:56.830 --> 18:58.170
What is that?

18:58.170 --> 18:59.920
An intranet is a private closed system.

19:00.620 --> 19:03.040
But here's a portal to a public page.

19:11.960 --> 19:15.170
Will someone explain why
the CIA would abduct Derek?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.120
Hey, Bob, it's Jennifer.
I need a big favor.

20:37.830 --> 20:40.040
-Who are you?
-

20:40.040 --> 20:43.710
Solomon-Comma-Edgar-Hector-Bravo-Kilo...

20:43.710 --> 20:45.380
Why are you doing this to me?

20:45.380 --> 20:48.380
Solomon-Comma-Edgar-Hector...

20:50.080 --> 20:51.960
Why are you doing this to me?

20:51.960 --> 20:54.040
You're a job. An assignment.

20:55.330 --> 20:58.460
They told me to bring you here
and hurt you.

20:58.460 --> 21:00.790
I do... I do as I'm told.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.330
Where's your backup?

21:02.330 --> 21:05.080
No backup. Just...

21:05.080 --> 21:07.080
Just cleanup. Just cleanup.

21:07.080 --> 21:08.460
When are they coming?

21:08.460 --> 21:09.540
12 hours.

21:09.830 --> 21:11.710
Isolation was the whole point,

21:12.170 --> 21:13.750
so no one would ever find you.

21:14.210 --> 21:15.380
Look for yourself.

21:17.710 --> 21:18.960
We're stranded.

22:31.330 --> 22:34.460
Good thing you know someone
with a PhD in chemistry.

22:34.830 --> 22:36.000
A couple years back,

22:36.000 --> 22:39.080
when our troops encountered
white phosphorus in Iraq,

22:39.080 --> 22:42.170
Reid took it upon himself to find a cure.

22:42.170 --> 22:44.920
The kid wouldn't shut up
about copper sulphate.

22:44.920 --> 22:49.000
Maybe you should thank him
the next time you see him.

22:51.710 --> 22:54.210
Am I ever going to see him again?

22:54.580 --> 22:57.000
I don't know. That's up to you.

22:57.380 --> 23:01.540
Just like your boss said,
you don't have enough for a profile yet.

23:03.250 --> 23:05.290
Why are we back here?

23:05.290 --> 23:09.170
You've been here before.
When you were 15 years old.

23:11.620 --> 23:14.620
If I visited this place when I was 15,
I would remember that.

23:14.620 --> 23:18.080
Because you didn't visit it, you built it.

23:20.330 --> 23:22.120
What was going on at 15?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.960
I don't want to talk about that.

23:25.210 --> 23:26.330
We have to.

23:29.170 --> 23:33.580
The man who did that to you
was a pillar in the community.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.670
I met him before I died.

23:36.120 --> 23:37.880
I was fooled, too.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.710
I was just a kid.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.000
I didn't know what to do.

24:01.670 --> 24:02.960
So I did nothing.

24:02.960 --> 24:04.290
That's not true.

24:06.080 --> 24:07.380
You survived.

24:08.420 --> 24:10.710
You created this space,

24:10.710 --> 24:13.420
the space in your head
that monster couldn't get to.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.000
But that place never went away.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.620
It was still here for you
when you needed it.

24:20.500 --> 24:21.710
Like now.

24:25.830 --> 24:27.210
Are you ashamed of me?

24:29.830 --> 24:32.620
I should have fought more, like...

24:33.500 --> 24:35.080
You would have.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.620
No.

24:37.960 --> 24:39.960
I'm not ashamed of you.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.120
I'm proud.

24:42.120 --> 24:43.330
Proud?

24:45.420 --> 24:47.290
How can you be proud?

24:47.290 --> 24:50.250
Because you turned your pain
into your greatest asset.

24:51.710 --> 24:53.210
And I saw it.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.330
You became the man of the house.

24:56.880 --> 25:00.000
You took care of your sisters
and your mother.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.790
And that's why you're good at what you do.

25:07.210 --> 25:09.960
My contact at the Agency told me
the guys who took Derek

25:09.960 --> 25:12.790
are freelance contractors
and not on our side.

25:12.790 --> 25:15.750
-So they're ex-spooks?
-Mostly foreign, a few domestic.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.000
These guys have figured out
how to piggyback

25:17.000 --> 25:19.380
on existing infrastructure
to hide their tracks.

25:19.380 --> 25:21.790
My contact thinks it might be this group.

25:21.790 --> 25:23.670
It's hard to stamp out
who might be

25:23.670 --> 25:25.330
hitching a ride on their computer traffic.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.120
Fortunately, one of the CIA versions of me

25:27.120 --> 25:29.040
is trying to crack
their encryption signatures.

25:29.040 --> 25:30.330
What do we know about them so far?

25:30.330 --> 25:33.500
A six-man team.
They do dirty work for the highest bidder.

25:33.500 --> 25:36.460
-What kind of dirty work?
-From what we can tell, disappearances.

25:36.460 --> 25:39.710
If you need someone politically
inconvenient to disappear,

25:39.710 --> 25:41.420
these guys make that happen.

25:41.420 --> 25:43.380
When you're in the field,
what do you rely on?

25:43.830 --> 25:46.120
My training. Instinct.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.170
And?

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
My team! The one I really need isn't here.

25:54.250 --> 25:55.620
Hey, there.

25:57.420 --> 26:00.500
What? All you had to do was ask.

26:01.790 --> 26:03.670
Hold on. Oops.

26:03.670 --> 26:04.750
Hi.

26:08.290 --> 26:09.380
Let's go.

26:10.210 --> 26:13.420
He was giving me a name
and a serial number.

26:13.420 --> 26:14.540
Military training.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.290
Yeah, but that combination
of letters and numbers

26:17.290 --> 26:18.710
isn't in my database.

26:18.710 --> 26:20.250
My database being your brain.

26:20.250 --> 26:21.620
No rank. There was no rank.

26:21.620 --> 26:23.170
He doesn't have rank.

26:23.170 --> 26:24.500
Not anymore. He's out.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.540
That's not enough.
I need more. Give me more.

26:33.620 --> 26:35.670
Garcia, can you zoom in
on the tattoo on his forearm?

26:35.670 --> 26:36.830
Yeah.

26:37.120 --> 26:39.880
Morgan's in more trouble than we thought.

26:41.460 --> 26:42.790
"Who dares wins."

26:43.750 --> 26:45.040
"Who dares wins."

26:45.040 --> 26:47.330
That's the motto
of the British Special Air Service.

26:47.330 --> 26:51.750
Which my system/your drunken night
hanging out with Scotland Yard

26:51.750 --> 26:53.120
is now filling me in on.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.040
The SAS designed
the first survival course,

26:56.040 --> 26:59.380
which our military used as
the basis for SERE school.

26:59.380 --> 27:00.960
That in turn evolved into...

27:00.960 --> 27:02.710
Enhanced interrogation techniques.

27:05.580 --> 27:06.830
They're torturers, Pop.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.120
And they're coming back.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.080
Listen...

27:10.080 --> 27:11.790
I'm telling you, they're all dead.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.380
I need an exfil now.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.420
Just get me out of here.

27:20.790 --> 27:22.250
No, no, now.

27:23.710 --> 27:25.290
No, you listen.

27:26.420 --> 27:28.420
Just get me out of here. We're done.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.040
You son of a bitch. You got a phone?

27:32.880 --> 27:34.380
He's still... God, he's coming.

27:42.380 --> 27:45.250
I need that phone. Give me the phone!

27:48.580 --> 27:50.750
No! No, don't do that!

27:50.750 --> 27:52.880
No! No! Don't do that!

27:53.710 --> 27:55.500
I just told you not to do that!

28:05.210 --> 28:07.540
It won't work now. The phone is useless.

28:07.540 --> 28:09.500
Whatever you swallowed,
you can throw back up.

28:17.500 --> 28:19.380
Why are you doing this to me?

28:20.670 --> 28:22.670
Why are you doing this to me?

28:23.580 --> 28:24.620
Why?

29:08.710 --> 29:10.290
Not like this!

29:10.290 --> 29:12.210
No, not like this.

29:13.290 --> 29:15.120
Not like what?

29:17.290 --> 29:19.420
You get to decide, do you?

29:20.330 --> 29:23.750
No. But I'm not doing this.

29:24.420 --> 29:29.040
I'm not buying it in some house
in the middle of nowhere.

29:30.250 --> 29:34.040
Well, you, you let me know when you're
done with your temper tantrum.

29:48.210 --> 29:49.750
That's a Dominican, right?

29:50.080 --> 29:51.380
Yeah.

29:51.380 --> 29:53.380
We had a Day of the Dead thing at work.

29:56.830 --> 29:58.620
I put that in there for you.

29:59.250 --> 30:00.460
I got it.

30:08.380 --> 30:09.710
I'm back, Pop.

30:09.710 --> 30:12.000
Good. Think like a profiler.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.500
Your team will find this farmhouse.

30:15.500 --> 30:17.250
That's inevitable.

30:18.000 --> 30:21.170
But what will they find
when they walk in the door?

30:25.960 --> 30:27.210
FBI!

30:28.920 --> 30:30.170
Morgan?

30:32.540 --> 30:33.580
Spence.

30:58.380 --> 31:00.120
Does anyone want to say anything?

31:04.790 --> 31:05.960
I do.

31:06.750 --> 31:07.920
I do.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.670
Hotch. Hotch.

31:14.920 --> 31:17.460
You've kept this team together, man.
I know that.

31:17.460 --> 31:19.290
I want to thank you.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.790
JJ.

31:21.790 --> 31:23.580
JJ, you're one of the best people I know.

31:23.580 --> 31:25.080
No, JJ, wait.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.830
Rossi. Kid.

31:28.170 --> 31:31.460
You've inspired me so much.
I never got to tell you that.

31:43.290 --> 31:46.540
Baby girl, please stay with me.

31:48.750 --> 31:52.460
No. No, please.
Please, don't, don't leave me.

32:04.620 --> 32:09.420
Stop that right now.
You're letting your fear take over.

32:09.420 --> 32:10.540
I'm so tired.

32:10.540 --> 32:13.120
You skipped over the most important part.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.960
When your team comes through that door,

32:16.500 --> 32:17.830
what are they gonna see?

32:17.830 --> 32:20.040
Me, on the floor,

32:21.290 --> 32:23.380
with a useless phone in my hand.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.120
Wait.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.120
If I press redial,
one of those guys is gonna answer.

32:32.750 --> 32:34.790
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.

32:34.790 --> 32:35.960
You see it now?

32:35.960 --> 32:38.380
Yes, I... I see it.

32:40.210 --> 32:41.540
I may have a line on him.

32:41.540 --> 32:43.380
I just got notification from Fort Eustis.

32:43.380 --> 32:46.670
That encrypted sat phone,
it became active again

32:46.670 --> 32:48.920
and we managed to pin down
one side to here.

32:48.920 --> 32:51.080
It is a 20-mile radius of woods
in Virginia.

32:51.080 --> 32:52.710
The other side was to a contractor

32:52.710 --> 32:54.750
who didn't even bother
not to use his own cell phone.

32:54.750 --> 32:56.620
Arrogant. He thinks we can't find him.

32:56.620 --> 32:57.790
And he would be wrong.

32:57.790 --> 33:01.750
He being John Bradley,
not SAS as we had suspected.

33:01.750 --> 33:04.420
Bradley and Mr. Who Dares Wins

33:04.420 --> 33:06.580
tried to become SAS,
but they couldn't cut it.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.000
Not to mention people who are SAS

33:08.000 --> 33:11.620
don't get tattoos saying SAS
because SAS is covert. That is the point.

33:11.620 --> 33:14.120
But apparently people who are
dishonorably discharged

33:14.120 --> 33:16.250
from the British Royal Marines
do get that tattoo.

33:16.250 --> 33:17.670
Your last ping has him
in Derek's direction.

33:17.670 --> 33:18.880
He's probably on his way to him now.

33:18.880 --> 33:21.420
We've got helos on the roof
standing by for immediate transport.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.920
Any way we can narrow down the search?

33:22.920 --> 33:25.290
Yes. Their encryption algorithms are dust.

33:25.290 --> 33:27.620
If and when that sat phone
connects, I've got him.

33:27.620 --> 33:29.250
- -

33:31.540 --> 33:32.830
Hello?

33:32.830 --> 33:35.500
Sir, it just went live.

33:36.330 --> 33:37.540
Solomon, is that you, mate?

33:39.000 --> 33:42.620
No. It's Agent Morgan, isn't it?

33:43.000 --> 33:44.380
Is this the cleanup crew?

33:44.380 --> 33:45.880
That's me.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.620
Well, you got a whole
hell of a lot of cleaning up

33:49.620 --> 33:50.880
to do when you get here.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.580
- -That's funny to you.

34:04.580 --> 34:07.750
Yeah, what's funny is you trying
to keep me on the line.

34:17.920 --> 34:22.620
Even if your team finds you,
all they're gonna find is a corpse,

34:22.620 --> 34:25.330
-because I'm closer.-That's tough talk.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.500
How are you feeling right now?

34:33.920 --> 34:35.750
Not so good, I bet.

34:36.710 --> 34:41.670
So, yeah, I'll be seeing you real soon.

34:49.290 --> 34:51.210
Son. Son?

34:51.210 --> 34:52.380
Wait.

34:54.380 --> 34:57.040
Come on. What else is there?

34:57.500 --> 34:59.040
How did you get here, Derek?

34:59.460 --> 35:02.380
They kidnapped me from the grocery store.

35:05.080 --> 35:07.120
I was buying food for dinner.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.420
For who?

35:10.080 --> 35:11.250
Savannah.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.120
Do you love her?

35:27.330 --> 35:29.880
Yes, I do.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.670
There's the moment when you realize
you love a woman,

35:32.670 --> 35:36.080
and the moment you realize
you're gonna marry her.

35:36.080 --> 35:37.710
I want to hear about the second one.

35:43.080 --> 35:45.330
It was the end of last year.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.960
I'd gotten in late from a case.

35:52.620 --> 35:54.040
It was a bad one.

35:54.790 --> 35:56.830
She found me downstairs.

35:58.210 --> 35:59.670
She didn't have to ask.

36:01.420 --> 36:04.960
We just sat there till the sun came up.

36:08.380 --> 36:09.710
No words.

36:14.290 --> 36:16.420
You were getting food from the store.

36:17.420 --> 36:19.620
-Does she cook a lot?
-No.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.830
She can't cook worth a damn.

36:24.170 --> 36:26.750
I know dinner's ready
when the smoke alarm goes off.

36:27.460 --> 36:28.920
She knows it, too.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.210
She hates her cooking
almost as much as I hate eating it.

36:31.210 --> 36:34.420
Must have been important, then,
her wanting you home for a meal.

36:35.580 --> 36:37.540
She said she wanted to tell me something.

36:38.040 --> 36:40.210
-Something bad?
-No. It...

36:43.120 --> 36:45.500
She said it was something good.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.620
I just want
to tell you I'm happy.

36:48.420 --> 36:50.170
And maybe I'll show you how happy

36:50.170 --> 36:51.880
-when I get home.-

36:52.500 --> 36:55.960
Okay, okay, I like the way that sounds.

36:58.540 --> 37:00.580
I think it was something wonderful, Pop.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.080
Yeah?

37:04.580 --> 37:06.170
She's pregnant.

37:07.540 --> 37:11.460
What are you gonna do, son

37:17.620 --> 37:19.080
Hello, Agent Morgan.

37:23.080 --> 37:24.960
You were an expensive job, mate.

37:25.830 --> 37:30.380
After what you did here,
I'll finish you for free.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.750
That's it

37:51.540 --> 37:52.670
Pop!

37:53.420 --> 37:54.620
Dad!

37:56.120 --> 37:57.250
Pop!

38:00.830 --> 38:03.920
You said you were gonna
stay with me through this!

38:05.000 --> 38:06.500
Where are you?

38:08.330 --> 38:09.420
Right here, son.

38:10.290 --> 38:11.670
-Wakey.
-

38:13.290 --> 38:14.460
Wake up.

38:25.580 --> 38:26.750
It's time to die.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.120
Not yet.

38:34.750 --> 38:35.830
Get medical in here.

38:54.620 --> 38:55.920
Dad...

38:55.920 --> 38:57.790
What is it, Morgan

38:59.790 --> 39:01.170
I'm scared, Pop.

39:08.540 --> 39:10.460
I can't feel anything.

39:14.080 --> 39:15.580
Pop, I'm scared.

39:15.580 --> 39:17.040
- -

39:24.170 --> 39:25.710
Dying is easy.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.620
You know what's hard?

39:30.620 --> 39:32.080
Not being there for your son.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.830
I want to. I do.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.750
I want to be there for my family.

39:41.750 --> 39:44.380
Savannah, Mom, my sisters.

39:45.960 --> 39:47.330
All of them, Pop.

39:52.120 --> 39:53.920
But what if I'm not strong enough?

39:54.290 --> 39:57.500
That's why I walked you
through those moments,

39:57.500 --> 40:00.420
so you could see what I've seen
for 30 years.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.920
You are strong enough.

40:05.290 --> 40:07.920
You've always been strong enough.

40:10.960 --> 40:12.170
Pop.

40:13.580 --> 40:15.580
I love you, son.

40:16.540 --> 40:18.420
More than you will ever know.

40:21.500 --> 40:23.250
Now go be a dad.

40:54.040 --> 40:55.120
Hi.

40:56.040 --> 40:57.080
How long?

40:58.710 --> 40:59.750
Three days.

41:01.040 --> 41:02.080
Thank you.

41:16.500 --> 41:18.040
Savannah.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.170
Yeah?

41:20.420 --> 41:21.750
I'm sorry.

41:22.460 --> 41:23.500
For what?

41:24.040 --> 41:25.460
I was late for dinner.

41:27.460 --> 41:28.750
It's okay.

41:30.880 --> 41:32.540
-You made it.
-No.

41:33.330 --> 41:35.250
The next time you ask,

41:36.420 --> 41:38.210
I will not be late for you.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.080
Or our son.

41:46.460 --> 41:47.620
How did you know?

41:47.620 --> 41:49.000
I figured it out.

41:54.330 --> 41:57.380
Then I guess
I should probably tell you

41:57.380 --> 41:59.420
that I don't know if it's a boy.

41:59.420 --> 42:00.500
It could be a girl.

42:01.420 --> 42:04.670
Do you know how much I love you?

42:06.920 --> 42:10.040
How much I appreciate
everything that you do?

42:13.330 --> 42:14.960
Will you marry me?

42:14.960 --> 42:16.960
- -Yes.

42:19.420 --> 42:20.540
Yes.
