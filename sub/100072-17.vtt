¶<i> It seems today</i>
<i>that all you see</i> ¶

00:04.863 --> 00:08.250
¶<i> Is violence in movies</i>

00:08.251 --> 00:11.869
¶<i> But where are those</i>

00:11.870 --> 00:14.706
¶<i> On which we used to rely?</i> ¶

00:14.707 --> 00:18.167
¶<i> Lucky there's a family guy</i> ¶

00:18.168 --> 00:21.521

00:36.904 --> 00:39.522
Thanks for coming
to our cocktail party, everyone.

00:39.523 --> 00:41.616
We're so glad you could make it.

00:41.617 --> 00:43.067
That's the speech
you were working on?

00:43.068 --> 00:44.694
Okay, now let's play a game.

00:44.695 --> 00:46.288
It's called:
"Everybody give me an idea

00:46.289 --> 00:47.697
what time you're leaving."

00:47.698 --> 00:49.216
Settle down, Peter.

00:49.217 --> 00:51.293
Hey, is the party
good out there? Can I come out?

00:51.294 --> 00:53.262
No, Brian,
you're fine in the kitchen.

00:53.263 --> 00:54.888
Is there food on the floor?
I can clean it up!

00:54.889 --> 00:57.040
- No.
- Oh, come on.

00:57.041 --> 00:59.083
Joe just dropped a cracker.
Joe just dropped a cracker!

00:59.084 --> 01:01.544
Damn it, Brian!

01:01.545 --> 01:04.547
I can't figure out
how to open the gate.

01:04.548 --> 01:06.591
Well, since this is
a nice cocktail party,

01:06.592 --> 01:08.402
let's talk about books.

01:08.403 --> 01:10.145
What book is everyone reading?

01:10.146 --> 01:12.072
I only read four books
in my life,

01:12.073 --> 01:13.890
and three of them were
about Johnny Bench.

01:13.891 --> 01:15.558
Ah, I can top that.

01:15.559 --> 01:17.485
I ain't ever read a book
in my entire life.

01:18.913 --> 01:20.747
- Never read a book?
- Peter's never read a book!

01:20.748 --> 01:22.774
Yeah, I heard the first guy.

01:22.775 --> 01:26.086
And you said
this was a fancy cocktail party.

01:26.087 --> 01:27.945
Reginald, we're leaving!

01:30.591 --> 01:32.617
Damn it!
I shopped at Trader Joe's

01:32.618 --> 01:35.119
for this fancy cocktail party,
and once again,

01:35.120 --> 01:36.579
your ignorance of books
has ruined it.

01:36.580 --> 01:38.414
Enough is enough.

01:38.415 --> 01:41.084
I got a junior high book list
here, and starting tomorrow,

01:41.085 --> 01:42.960
you are reading one
of these books.

01:42.961 --> 01:45.680
<i>Little Women, Holes, The Giver.</i>

01:45.681 --> 01:47.015
These are all porn categories.

01:47.016 --> 01:48.633
<i>Black Beauty.</i>

01:48.634 --> 01:50.718
Is there anything here
that's not pornography?

01:50.719 --> 01:53.355
<i>1984!</i> Just read <i> 1984.</i>

01:53.356 --> 01:55.765
Fine. Geez. I'll read <i> 1984.</i>

01:55.766 --> 01:57.975
You better, 'cause this was
more embarrassing

01:57.976 --> 02:01.029
than when we played truth or
dare with present-day Madonna.

02:01.030 --> 02:03.865
Ah... truth.

02:03.866 --> 02:06.126
Do I look younger than 90?

02:06.127 --> 02:07.752
Dare.

02:11.799 --> 02:14.209
Ah, the public library.

02:14.210 --> 02:16.711
I'm just gonna put my backpack
down for one second.

02:16.712 --> 02:18.121
And it's gone.

02:18.122 --> 02:19.714
My laptop was in there,
no password.

02:19.715 --> 02:20.957
My wallet. Everything.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.384
That person is now me.

02:22.385 --> 02:24.460
My entire life went away.

02:24.461 --> 02:26.671
Hey, how do you find something
in here?

02:26.672 --> 02:29.724
It's a lot easier
than finding a man out there.

02:31.894 --> 02:34.137
Yeah.
Yeah, maybe wash your hair,

02:34.138 --> 02:35.897
lose the bun,
give that a chance.

02:35.898 --> 02:37.640
Anyway, you guys have <i> 1984?</i>

02:37.641 --> 02:39.684
We've got it on CD.

02:39.685 --> 02:41.403
"C-D."

02:41.404 --> 02:44.814
Sounds like my high school
report card.

02:44.815 --> 02:47.666
Okay, okay,
all right, all right.

02:49.912 --> 02:52.247
Okay, boring book: <i> 1984.</i>

02:52.248 --> 02:53.990
I am ready for you to be lame

02:53.991 --> 02:56.200
and a book
and not something unexpected.

03:00.348 --> 03:03.040
-¶<i> Oh, yeah...</i> ¶
- This is books?

03:03.041 --> 03:07.186
- Books kick ass!
- ¶<i> Panama, Pana...</i> ¶

03:09.265 --> 03:11.816
Probably reading Orwell.

03:15.179 --> 03:17.013
Kids, where's your father?

03:17.014 --> 03:18.723
He left a note.

03:18.724 --> 03:20.742
"If Van Halen calls,
tell them they rule."

03:20.743 --> 03:21.851
What?

03:21.852 --> 03:24.871
¶<i> Panama...</i> ¶

03:24.872 --> 03:28.065
- Did they call?
- Peter, what are you doing?!

03:28.066 --> 03:31.068
I did what you wanted. I went
to the library and I got <i> 1984.</i>

03:31.069 --> 03:34.047
What a book!

03:34.048 --> 03:37.217
Peter, I'm not okay with this
new Van Halen phase of yours.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.076
Yeah, Dad, it's crazy.

03:39.077 --> 03:42.964
Like JFK deciding to cruise
through Dallas in a rental.

03:42.965 --> 03:44.891
How'd that convertible
work out for you?

03:44.892 --> 03:47.543
Yeah, I don't... I don't know.
Good. Okay.

03:47.544 --> 03:49.921
And did you get all your stuff
out of the car?

03:49.922 --> 03:51.973
Kind of.

03:51.974 --> 03:53.591
¶<i> Panama...</i> ¶

03:53.592 --> 03:55.235
<i>All units, this is Dispatch.</i>

03:55.236 --> 03:57.737
<i>We've got a red station wagon
blasting "Panama"</i>

03:57.738 --> 03:59.981
<i>and being awesome
and partying and being rad.</i>

03:59.982 --> 04:02.433
Not in my town, Dispatch.

04:02.434 --> 04:06.154
This is Officer Stickbutt,
in pursuit.

04:06.155 --> 04:07.605
¶<i> Whoo!</i> ¶

04:09.917 --> 04:12.109
<i>Stickbutt, break off pursuit.</i>

04:12.110 --> 04:14.829
<i>"Panama" kicks too much ass
and shreds way too hard.</i>

04:14.830 --> 04:16.255
<i>You'll never catch him.</i>

04:16.257 --> 04:18.425
Negative, Dispatch.
Just need to wait

04:18.426 --> 04:21.452
for that "Runnin' a little bit
hot tonight" part.

04:21.452 --> 04:23.838
¶<i> Yeah, we're runnin'</i>
<i>a little bit hot tonight</i> ¶

04:23.839 --> 04:27.100
Bingo. Got him now.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.126
¶<i> I can barely see the road</i> ¶

04:29.127 --> 04:30.461
¶<i> From the heat coming</i>
<i>off of it</i> ¶

04:32.106 --> 04:34.131
What's he doing?!

04:34.132 --> 04:36.926
Suspect is headed
toward Unjumpable Canyon.

04:36.927 --> 04:39.262
- It's totally unjumpable!
- ¶<i> Ease the seat back...</i> ¶

04:39.263 --> 04:42.932
- Unless...
<i>- Unless what, Stickbutt? Over.</i>

04:42.933 --> 04:45.285
Dear God, he's gonna do it.

04:45.286 --> 04:48.604
He's gonna time his jump for the
greatest harmonized sound drop

04:48.605 --> 04:50.532
in '80s rock history.

04:50.533 --> 04:52.200
<i>You're right.
The part that goes...</i>

04:52.201 --> 04:54.151
¶<i> Ain't no stoppin'</i> ¶

04:54.152 --> 04:58.447
¶<i> Now...!</i> ¶

05:03.954 --> 05:06.047
-¶<i> Panama</i> ¶
-Damn it!

05:06.048 --> 05:08.308
<i>- What? What happened?</i>
- Get off this channel, Joe.

05:08.309 --> 05:11.127
<i>Come on, I want</i>
<i>to be an outside cop!</i>

05:11.128 --> 05:12.895
¶<i> Panama.</i> ¶

05:18.227 --> 05:20.820
¶<i> Panama.</i> ¶

05:20.821 --> 05:22.730
Damn it, Peter,
I'm sick of this!

05:22.731 --> 05:25.066
Take that Van Halen CD back
today.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.826
No way. I ain't never
returning that CD.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.978
It's too awesome.

05:28.979 --> 05:30.855
I didn't want to play this card,
Peter, but...

05:30.856 --> 05:32.481
if you won't listen to me,

05:32.482 --> 05:35.192
listen to the pancake
with slices of banana on it.

05:35.193 --> 05:37.003
Oh, my God.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.838
But you're always smiling.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.674
Note the maple syrup tears.

05:40.675 --> 05:43.676
Don't you think I see
the maple syrup tears, Lois?!

05:47.848 --> 05:50.641
I guess
my Van Halen days are over.

05:55.856 --> 05:58.549
No, no, no.
Those days are behind me.

05:58.550 --> 06:00.568
I made a promise to a pancake.

06:02.771 --> 06:04.698
¶<i> On and on</i> ¶

06:04.699 --> 06:08.109
¶<i> He just keeps on trying</i> ¶

06:08.110 --> 06:12.229

- Working squirrel.

06:51.153 --> 06:52.912
Hey, in case you need it,

06:52.913 --> 06:55.064
someone left this business card
at the crash site.

06:55.065 --> 06:57.900
Looks like there's a new
squirrel in the insurance game.

06:57.901 --> 06:59.753
I don't care about that,
Dr. Hartman.

06:59.754 --> 07:02.571
Just tell me
what's wrong with my husband.

07:02.572 --> 07:04.924
I'm sorry, Mrs. Griffin,
but your husband...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.784
is in a coma.

07:06.785 --> 07:08.428
Oh, my God!

07:08.429 --> 07:10.913
And to deliver the news
to your teenage children,

07:10.914 --> 07:12.790
I've hired an EDM DJ.

07:12.791 --> 07:14.768
¶<i> Your father's in a coma</i> ¶

07:14.769 --> 07:17.011
¶<i> Coma, coma, coma, coma, coma</i> ¶

07:17.012 --> 07:18.754
¶<i> He's gonna die.</i> ¶

07:18.755 --> 07:20.682
This is awesome!

07:20.683 --> 07:24.026
Yeah, I saw this guy playing
at an H&M, and I got his number!

07:31.026 --> 07:32.810
My husband is in a coma?!

07:32.811 --> 07:34.454
I'm afraid so.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.814
I mean, he's not responding
to my advances,

07:36.815 --> 07:39.125
so it's either a coma,
or he's a frigid bitch.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.818
We'll leave you with him now.

07:40.819 --> 07:42.820
But it's very important
that you speak to Peter.

07:42.821 --> 07:44.447
He can hear you.

07:44.448 --> 07:46.949
Talk about the good times,
what he means to you.

07:46.950 --> 07:49.093
Talk and keep talking.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.938
Psh-psh-pshew.

08:01.890 --> 08:04.559
Let's just turn on the TV.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.694
<i>We now return to</i> The Simpsons.

08:10.682 --> 08:12.400
Meme.

08:12.401 --> 08:13.993
Not a meme.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.995
Meme.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.454
Not a meme.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.375
Where am I?
Hey, let me out. Let me out!

08:24.029 --> 08:28.215
Hello, Peter.

09:08.698 --> 09:11.959
What did I ever do
to deserve this?!

09:11.960 --> 09:15.054
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!

09:15.055 --> 09:16.705
Oh, yeah!

09:18.750 --> 09:20.835
<i>The Godfather</i> insists
upon itself.

09:20.836 --> 09:23.212
- It insists upon itself.
- It insists upon itself.

09:23.213 --> 09:25.256
<i>The Godfather</i> insists
upon itself.

09:25.257 --> 09:27.341
- It insists upon itself.
- It insists upon itself.

09:27.342 --> 09:29.009
It insists upon itself.

09:29.010 --> 09:30.594
<i>The Godfather</i> insists
upon itself.

09:30.595 --> 09:31.905
- It insists...
- It insists...

09:31.906 --> 09:34.056
Ah, no! Wait!
I agree with all of you!

09:34.057 --> 09:35.199
...upon itself.

09:41.064 --> 09:43.491
Has the jury reached a verdict?

09:43.492 --> 09:44.992
We have, Your Honor.

09:44.993 --> 09:46.920
And how do you find
the defendant?

09:46.921 --> 09:49.330
B'caw, or not b'caw?

09:49.331 --> 09:52.575
We find the defendant,
Peter Griffin, b'caw.

09:55.838 --> 09:59.123
Peter Griffin,
I hereby sentence you

09:59.124 --> 10:03.085
to an awkward apology dinner
with Joaquin Phoenix.

10:06.965 --> 10:09.967
Well... I'm waiting.

10:09.968 --> 10:12.687
Hey, if, uh, this goes south,

10:12.688 --> 10:16.265
is there a plan
for Peter's rakes?

10:16.266 --> 10:18.785
Um... who's gonna
get Peter's rakes?

10:18.786 --> 10:21.145
What did I tell you, Mom?
What did I tell you?

10:21.146 --> 10:22.622
Well, I just thought
it would be one less thing

10:22.623 --> 10:24.031
to worry about later.

10:24.032 --> 10:26.292
You came out
of the blocks too soon, Joe.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.537
Oh, Lois,
I came as soon as I heard.

10:29.538 --> 10:33.282
So... h-have you guys made
any arrangements rake-wise?

10:33.283 --> 10:35.784
Bonnie. Ix-nay on the akes-ray.

10:39.882 --> 10:41.290
Clear!

10:41.291 --> 10:44.477
No, you do stuff up here. Clear!

10:44.478 --> 10:52.059
Clear!

10:54.012 --> 10:56.990
No, that's the good sound.

10:56.991 --> 10:59.183
Oh, well, why don't you
just do everything.

10:59.184 --> 11:01.143
I hate this stupid hospital.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.162
Clear!

11:09.694 --> 11:11.654
- What are they all doing here?
- The canal.

11:11.655 --> 11:13.748
- She is finished.
- What canal?

11:13.749 --> 11:16.825
Think, senor.
What is your new favorite song?

11:16.826 --> 11:18.511
- "Panama"?
<i>- Sí.</i>

11:18.512 --> 11:19.921
It is the Panama Canal.

11:19.922 --> 11:21.923
Your President Woodrow Wilson

11:21.924 --> 11:24.541
is giving the dedication
right now.

11:24.542 --> 11:27.687
Ah, you reach down
between my legs.

11:27.688 --> 11:29.672
Ease the seat back.

11:29.673 --> 11:32.099
Got the feeling. Power steering.

11:32.100 --> 11:33.768
Pistons popping.

11:33.769 --> 11:36.845
Ain't no stopping now, Panama.

11:39.057 --> 11:41.016
And now, senor, you must pee.

11:41.017 --> 11:43.227
- What?
- Pee. You must pee.

11:43.228 --> 11:44.995
Fill the canal.

11:47.023 --> 11:49.283
Well, it's gonna take a minute.

11:49.284 --> 11:51.786
- You see <i> Coco?</i>
- Of course.

11:51.787 --> 11:54.714
- It's good, right?
- It's very good.

11:54.715 --> 11:57.366
Okay, I'm gonna try pulling
my pants all the way down.

11:57.367 --> 11:59.794
Sometimes that helps.

11:59.795 --> 12:02.037
- It wasn't a true story, right?
- What?

12:02.038 --> 12:04.057
<i>- Coco.</i>
- No, it was fiction.

12:04.058 --> 12:06.133
Somebody make it up
out of their head.

12:06.134 --> 12:08.043
Aw, that's too bad.

12:08.044 --> 12:10.879
I can't go. Can't we
just fill this up with a hose?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.898
Oh, yeah. Turn on the hose!

12:20.098 --> 12:21.098
Mayor West?

12:21.099 --> 12:22.099
Angela?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.059
My dad?

12:24.060 --> 12:26.821
Quagmire's fat girlfriend
who died in the <i> Clue</i> episode?

12:26.822 --> 12:29.064
What do all these people
have in common?

12:29.065 --> 12:31.959
And how do they know
I like being slowly beckoned?

12:37.073 --> 12:40.451
Mrs. Griffin, I have
some good news or some bad news

12:40.452 --> 12:42.244
depending on how you feel
about your husband.

12:42.245 --> 12:44.621
- Do you love your husband?
- Yes.

12:44.622 --> 12:46.432
Mrs. Griffin,
I have some bad news.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.459
Your husband is brain-dead.

12:48.460 --> 12:52.105
I'm afraid it's time
for you to... make your choice.

12:52.106 --> 12:55.349
What? A-Are you telling me
I should pull the plug?

12:55.350 --> 12:56.776
I'm afraid so.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.519
Also, you might be
getting a call

12:58.520 --> 13:00.262
about the service
you received here today.

13:00.263 --> 13:02.264
Do you feel
I've earned all tens?

13:02.265 --> 13:04.617
Oh, God, I-I don't know.

13:04.618 --> 13:06.285
I can't get
anything less than a ten,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.478
so if there's a problem,

13:07.479 --> 13:08.788
you should tell me about it
right now.

13:08.789 --> 13:10.773
I may have to pull the plug
on my husband.

13:10.774 --> 13:12.458
Yeah, I-I can't do anything
about that.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.986
But really, we-we really,
really, really need the tens.

13:15.987 --> 13:18.539
I-It's two minutes for you.
It's a job or not for me.

13:20.134 --> 13:22.159
Hello?

13:22.160 --> 13:23.660
Six.

13:23.661 --> 13:25.621
Yeah, six across the board.

13:25.622 --> 13:26.888
Ah, nuts.

13:29.334 --> 13:32.836
Senor Griffin, I think it's time
for you to depart.

13:32.837 --> 13:35.815
Thanks, Jose, probably.
Thanks for everything.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.484
Hey, before I go, what's
the boat's Wi-Fi password?

13:38.485 --> 13:40.677
Oh, there's no Wi-Fi on board.

13:40.678 --> 13:45.282
I don't want to go!

13:47.352 --> 13:49.495
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:49.496 --> 13:52.523
That's a... that's a plug.

13:52.524 --> 13:55.859
You...
You pulled the plug on me?

13:55.860 --> 13:58.487
Peter, it was
a very difficult decision.

13:58.488 --> 14:00.006
How could you do that?
I'm alive.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.008
I'm here
from the mortgage company.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.827
Mr. Griffin, you're three months
late on your payment.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.539
Oh, he died.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.924
Oh, that's too bad.

14:09.925 --> 14:12.501
Mind if I turn on
my cotton candy machine?

14:14.712 --> 14:16.396
Aw, you got me.

14:23.271 --> 14:25.848
Hey, sweetheart.
How you feeling?

14:25.849 --> 14:28.776
Terrible! My family tried
to off me in my sleep.

14:28.777 --> 14:30.727
We said we're sorry, all right?

14:30.728 --> 14:32.371
We're sorry we pulled the plug!

14:32.372 --> 14:35.282
-But you know what?
It was a relief.
-What?

14:35.283 --> 14:38.044
There! I said it. You know what
it's like being married to you?

14:38.045 --> 14:39.695
Every day wondering

14:39.696 --> 14:42.123
if my husband's gonna die
from something stupid?

14:42.124 --> 14:44.575
Crashing your Petercopter.
Getting eaten at the zoo.

14:44.576 --> 14:46.961
Running into a tunnel
that's not really a tunnel

14:46.962 --> 14:48.370
but just something
the Road Runner painted

14:48.371 --> 14:49.746
on the side of a rock.

14:49.747 --> 14:51.224
Yeah, well,
I saw <i> him</i> go through it.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.559
Honestly,
I-I'm amazed you haven't died

14:53.560 --> 14:56.712
in some kind of <i> Black Mirror</i>
techno nightmare by now.

14:56.713 --> 14:58.139
Excuse me.

14:58.140 --> 15:00.066
I have to take
this phone call from...

15:00.067 --> 15:03.151
Me?!

15:09.058 --> 15:12.245
This me took a picture
of dog poo.

15:12.246 --> 15:14.580
The thought of losing you
was such a burden.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.566
So when the moment came,
I confess.

15:17.567 --> 15:19.735
I-I felt free, and I did it.

15:19.736 --> 15:20.828
I pulled the plug.

15:20.829 --> 15:23.089
And then
I instantly regretted it.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.166
And when you woke up,
I was overjoyed.

15:25.167 --> 15:27.910
I'm so sorry,
and if there's any way

15:27.911 --> 15:30.621
I can make it up to you,
I will. I promise.

15:30.622 --> 15:32.080
We all will.

15:32.081 --> 15:33.916
Damn right
you're gonna make it up to me.

15:33.917 --> 15:35.509
I am gonna be
more high-maintenance

15:35.510 --> 15:37.753
than a white woman on vacation.

15:37.754 --> 15:40.181
Excuse me, could I get
<i>dos</i> margaritas, por favor?

15:40.182 --> 15:42.775
Yoo-hoo! Hello? Senor?

15:42.776 --> 15:45.778
Excuse me? Could I get towels?
We need more towels.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.639
Wh-When you get a chance,
but right now.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.409
Is someone available
to take 20 to 40 pictures of me?

15:56.481 --> 15:57.940
Family, you know how
you said you're sorry

15:57.941 --> 16:00.108
- and you'll do anything I want?
- Yeah.

16:00.109 --> 16:01.652
Well, this is Timothy Olyphant.

16:01.653 --> 16:04.321
I want you to line up
and give him one compliment

16:04.322 --> 16:06.707
about his Netflix show,
the <i> Santa Clarita Diet.</i>

16:06.708 --> 16:08.951
- Aw, really?
- And it has to sound legit.

16:08.952 --> 16:10.285
Like you've actually watched it.

16:10.286 --> 16:12.996
Peter, you ask too much.

16:12.997 --> 16:15.791
Hey, you tried to kill me.
This is the logical consequence.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.960
Uh, Mr. Olyphant,

16:17.961 --> 16:19.979
I think you were awesome
in <i> Deadwood.</i>

16:19.980 --> 16:21.647
No, no, that's not what I said.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.799
The comments
have to exclusively relate

16:23.800 --> 16:25.484
to the <i> Santa Clarita Diet,</i>

16:25.485 --> 16:28.637
a show which aired
three full seasons on Netflix.

16:28.638 --> 16:30.973
I will take the first compliment
off the table.

16:30.974 --> 16:32.474
I like your hair.

16:32.475 --> 16:33.850
Well, now I have nothing.

16:33.851 --> 16:36.019
- Come on, kids, we're leaving.
- What?

16:36.020 --> 16:38.072
It's over.
You'll never forgive us

16:38.073 --> 16:40.482
for killing you at the hospital,
so we're done.

16:40.483 --> 16:42.243
We're leaving town today.

16:42.244 --> 16:43.836
You... You're leaving?

16:43.837 --> 16:45.654
You'll never hear from us again.

16:45.655 --> 16:47.322
It'll be like <i> we</i> died.

16:47.323 --> 16:49.157
Come on, kids.

16:49.158 --> 16:51.326
No, don't take the kids.

16:51.327 --> 16:54.997
Please. No.
Whatever will I do without them?

16:54.998 --> 16:57.091
Banana pancake, you, too?

16:57.092 --> 16:58.517
You're leaving forever?

16:58.518 --> 17:01.354
I'm actually going
to Hedo for Pancakes.

17:01.355 --> 17:03.839
Oh, yeah!
The ripping and the tearing.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.191
The ripping and the tearing.

17:05.192 --> 17:07.026
The syrup and the bacon.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.069
The syrup and the...

17:14.943 --> 17:16.368
Well, they're gone.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.353
It's all right. I'll be okay.

17:18.354 --> 17:20.614
And I definitely won't have
any flashbacks

17:20.615 --> 17:23.858
of our happy times together
to convince me otherwise.

You'll be driving there slow.

would show up at the last second

one of those airport scenes.

18:55.993 --> 18:57.803
I just... I've been thinking.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.546
Okay, so you tried to kill me.

18:59.547 --> 19:02.290
But maybe that's what
a family is, you know?

who try to kill each other.
