00:02.669 --> 00:04.254
<i>-HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED IN FRONT OF

00:04.337 --> 00:05.922
A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
- THE MOMENT WE'VE ALL BEEN
WAITING FOR IS FINALLY HERE.

00:10.009 --> 00:12.595
TONIGHT,
ON THE MOST DRAMATIC EPISODE

00:12.679 --> 00:15.473
IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SERIES--

00:15.557 --> 00:19.227
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

00:19.310 --> 00:21.229
- I'M SORRY, JOY.
UM, LOOK...

00:21.312 --> 00:23.606
YOU'RE ABOUT TO EMBARK
ON AN INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.108
TELL US ABOUT IT.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.444
- WELL, EVERY YEAR,
FOR OUR FAKE BIRTHDAYS,

00:27.527 --> 00:29.487
MY FRIENDS AND I FIX
EACH OTHER UP.

00:29.571 --> 00:33.324
- FOUR WOMEN, FOUR DATES.
THERE'S A CHANCE NO ONE'S HEART

00:33.408 --> 00:35.660
IS GONNA BE BROKEN HERE.
WHERE'S THE FUN IN THAT?

00:35.744 --> 00:38.913
- OH, THERE'S ALWAYS PLENTY
OF HEARTBREAK.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.415
BUT THIS YEAR'S GOING
TO BE DIFFERENT.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.250
- DO YOU SAY THAT EVERY YEAR?

00:42.333 --> 00:43.585
- YES.

00:43.668 --> 00:45.962
BUT THIS YEAR REALLY
IS GOING TO BE DIFFERENT.

00:46.045 --> 00:48.631
- DO YOU ALSO SAY THAT
EVERY YEAR?

00:48.715 --> 00:50.925
- YES.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.594
- JUST TELL ME ABOUT THE DATES.

00:52.677 --> 00:56.306
- WELL, ELKA WANTED US TO TRACK
DOWN STAN, HER FIRST LOVE,

00:56.389 --> 00:58.808
WHO SHE LEFT BEHIND IN POLAND
70 YEARS AGO.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.645
- HE WAS MR. SOUR CREAM
WHEN I WAS MISS TEEN POTATO.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.027
WHEN THE VILLAGERS
LAID HIM ON TOP OF ME

01:09.110 --> 01:11.196
AND WRAPPED US IN TINFOIL...

01:11.279 --> 01:16.826
WELL,
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.162
- SO, WHAT KIND OF RITUAL
IS THAT?

01:19.245 --> 01:23.374
- WELL, IT WAS SUPPOSED
TO KEEP THE GERMANS AWAY.

01:23.458 --> 01:27.253
IN HINDSIGHT,
WE SHOULD'VE INVESTED IN TANKS.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.383
- VICTORIA WANTED US TO SET
HER UP WITH A MALE MODEL

01:32.467 --> 01:34.719
SHE SAW IN <i> CLEVELAND MAGAZINE.</i>

01:34.803 --> 01:38.014
- WELL, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
ROMANCE. ALL I WANT IS BEAUTY.

01:38.097 --> 01:40.183
- YOU SAY THAT EVERY YEAR.

01:40.266 --> 01:42.685
- YEAH, WELL, I HAVE YET
TO GET IT.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.022
I HAVE PUT UP WITH MAN BOOBS,
CONJOINED TWINS...

01:46.105 --> 01:49.692
WEBBING, AND TAILS.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.861
- WHAT'S SO WEIRD ABOUT A GUY
WITH A TAIL?

01:51.945 --> 01:55.532
YOU KNOW, MANY PROMINENT, SEXY
ENTERTAINMENT PERSONALITIES

01:55.615 --> 01:58.701
HAVE TAILS.
- OH, MY GOD, DO YOU MEAN YOU--

01:58.785 --> 02:00.703
- HEY, YOU KNOW, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL ME ABOUT

02:00.787 --> 02:02.205
THE DATE WITH MELANIE.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.416
- WELL, SHE WANTED A GUY
WHO CALLED INTO HER RADIO SHOW,

02:05.500 --> 02:08.377
LOOKING FOR ADVICE FOR
HIS SHYNESS WITH WOMEN.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.213
- SO, I TOLD HIM TO SEE
A COUNSELOR.

02:10.295 --> 02:12.882
AND THEN, A WEEK LATER,
HE CALLS BACK OFF THE AIR

02:12.966 --> 02:15.051
AND HE WAS JUST SO GRATEFUL
AND SWEET,

02:15.134 --> 02:16.719
AND INCREDIBLY PERCEPTIVE.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.429
- WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY?

02:18.513 --> 02:20.014
- HE SAID I WAS BEAUTIFUL
AND SMART.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.225
[murmurs of agreement]

02:22.308 --> 02:24.894
- WELL, I WISH YOU LUCK
WITH YOUR DESPERATE

02:24.978 --> 02:27.272
LITTLE DATING CAPERS.

02:27.355 --> 02:29.065
I, OF COURSE,
WILL BE WITH MITCH,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.734
THE MAN I LOVE, AND WHO,
IN AN UNUSUAL TWIST,

02:31.818 --> 02:34.028
LOVES ME BACK.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.697
SO, DON'T EVEN BOTHER
WISHING ME LUCK,

02:35.780 --> 02:39.576
BECAUSE, FOR ONCE IN MY LIFE,
I DON'T NEED IT.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.369
- SO YOU RUBBED IT IN
YOUR FRIENDS' FACES

02:41.452 --> 02:43.454
BY SAYING YOU HAD
THE PERFECT DATE.

02:43.538 --> 02:45.248
AND THEN YOU TEMPTED FATE
BY SAYING

02:45.331 --> 02:48.084
NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY
GO WRONG FOR YOU.

02:48.167 --> 02:51.754
IN RETROSPECT,
YOU WISH YOU HADN'T DONE THAT?

02:51.838 --> 02:55.758
- I DO.
I REALLY DO.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.191

03:53.274 --> 03:55.151

ME TO GET PROFESSIONAL HELP,

04:03.034 --> 04:04.160
{\an8}MARCY IS THE PERSON I CALLED.

04:04.243 --> 04:06.454
- OH, SHE'S YOUR THERAPIST.

04:06.537 --> 04:08.915
- MM, IN A WAY.
I'M HIS SEX SURROGATE.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.464
- WHAT?
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:17.548 --> 04:20.093
WE'VE HAD SEX ENOUGH TIMES
THAT, UH, I'M...

04:20.176 --> 04:23.388
I'M READY TO DO IT
WITH A WOMAN I'M DATING.

04:23.471 --> 04:27.058
- AND IF TONIGHT GOES WELL,
MELANIE, THAT COULD BE YOU.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.645
AND LET ME TELL YOU,
YOU'RE IN FOR A TREAT.

04:37.235 --> 04:39.862
- ELKA?
- YES?

04:39.946 --> 04:43.908
- IT'S ME, STAN!

04:43.992 --> 04:47.578
YOUR FIRST LOVE?

04:47.662 --> 04:51.332
- STAN?
- WELL, OLGA, NOW.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.044
BUT YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED
A BIT.

04:55.128 --> 04:58.923
- YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND...

04:59.007 --> 05:01.843
- I JUST HAPPENED UPON A PICTURE
OF YOU ON THE INTERNET,

05:01.926 --> 05:05.513
IN A BATHING SUIT,
AND I HAVE TO ASK...

05:05.596 --> 05:07.515
WAS THERE ANY PHOTOSHOPPING
DONE,

05:07.598 --> 05:10.893
OR ARE YOU ACTUALLY...
PERFECT FROM HEAD TO TOE?

05:10.977 --> 05:14.772
- I ACTUALLY AM.

05:14.856 --> 05:17.734
BUT THAT'S SO SUPERFICIAL.
THE THING THAT MADE ME

05:17.817 --> 05:19.736
WANT TO GO OUT WITH YOU WAS
WHEN I READ THAT YOU DONATED

05:19.819 --> 05:24.032
A KIDNEY.
- THAT MAKES ME GLAD I DID IT.

05:24.115 --> 05:27.076
- IT INSPIRED ME. GAVE ME
THE COURAGE TO TAKE A BREAK

05:27.160 --> 05:28.536
FROM MODELING,
HELP SOMEONE OUT.

05:28.619 --> 05:30.580
- ARE YOU DONATING A KIDNEY
TO SOMEONE?

05:30.663 --> 05:33.124
- NO, UH, MY BROTHER
WAS IN A CAR ACCIDENT

05:33.207 --> 05:36.461
AND HIS NOSE
WAS IRREPARABLY DAMAGED.

05:36.544 --> 05:40.465
WELL, FOREHEAD SKIN IS THE BEST
MATCH FOR NOSE SKIN.

05:40.548 --> 05:44.469
- SO...YOU'RE DONATING
SOME OF YOUR PERFECT

05:44.552 --> 05:47.305
FOREHEAD SKIN TO YOUR BROTHER?
- EVEN BETTER.

05:47.388 --> 05:51.934
THIS IS REALLY GONNA
MAKE YOU HAPPY.

05:52.018 --> 05:54.395
IMPRESSIVE, HUH?

06:01.652 --> 06:05.448
- WELL, IT'S NOTHING
TO SNEEZE AT.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.077
- IT WAS SO ROMANTIC OF YOU
TO RESERVE THE WHOLE PATIO

06:09.160 --> 06:11.913
JUST FOR US.

06:11.996 --> 06:14.957
MITCH, ARE YOU OKAY?

06:15.041 --> 06:18.252
- JOY, I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT
ABOUT THE TWO OF US

06:18.336 --> 06:22.048
AND ABOUT HOW MUCH WE LOVE EACH
OTHER AND ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

06:22.131 --> 06:25.968
- FUTURE? ARE YOU SAYING
WHAT I THINK YOU'RE SAYING?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.470
- PLEASE, I WANT TO GET THIS
JUST RIGHT.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.474
- SORRY, GO AHEAD.

06:31.557 --> 06:34.644
- OKAY, UH, WHERE WAS I?

06:34.727 --> 06:36.145
THINKING ABOUT THE TWO OF US...

06:36.229 --> 06:37.814
LOVE EACH OTHER, FUTURE...
OH, UH, YEAH.

06:37.897 --> 06:41.651
DEEP BREATH.
TAKE A KNEE.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.028
JOY, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.824
WILL YOU--WILL YOU...

06:47.907 --> 06:49.659
- JOY, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

06:52.370 --> 06:55.456
- WHAT THE HELL?

06:55.540 --> 06:58.501
- SIMON, DID YOU
JUST PROPOSE TO ME?

06:58.584 --> 07:00.002
- YES, I DID.
- WELL, SO DID I.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.671
I W--I MEAN, I WAS GOING TO.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.841
JOY, WILL YOU MARRY ME?

07:04.924 --> 07:07.802
AND NOT HIM?

07:07.885 --> 07:10.638
- MINE'S BIGGER.

07:15.101 --> 07:19.230
- HE BROUGHT HIS SEX SURROGATE.
THIS IS THE WORST DATE EVER.

07:19.313 --> 07:22.567
- IS IT, MELANIE?

07:22.650 --> 07:25.027
HOW MANY NOSES
DOES YOUR DATE HAVE?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.156
BECAUSE MINE HAS TWO.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.033
- THAT'S NUTS.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.869
AND SPEAKING OF NUTS,

07:32.952 --> 07:35.621
MY DATE DOESN'T HAVE ANY
ANYMORE.

07:38.457 --> 07:40.376
- TWO MEN JUST PROPOSED TO ME.

07:40.459 --> 07:42.670
FIRST MITCH, AND THEN SIMON!

07:42.753 --> 07:45.590
- OH, MY GOD, JOY!
- I KNOW!

07:45.673 --> 07:48.050
TWO WONDERFUL, HANDSOME MEN
WHO WANT TO SPEND

07:48.134 --> 07:49.677
THE REST OF THEIR LIVES
WITH ME.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.888
OH, THIS IS ALL SO COMPLICATED.

07:51.971 --> 07:55.057
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
MORE COMPLICATED.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.893
A THIRD SUCH MAN
WHO WANTED TO PROPOSE

07:56.976 --> 07:59.854
BUT...MISSED HIS BUS.

07:59.937 --> 08:01.063
- BOB?

08:01.147 --> 08:03.733
- JOY...

08:03.816 --> 08:04.942
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

08:05.026 --> 08:07.236
[all gasp]

08:07.320 --> 08:09.864
- IT WAS MY GRANDMOTHER'S RING.
SHE LOVED IT SO MUCH,

08:09.947 --> 08:13.409
SHE WAS BURIED WITH IT.

08:13.492 --> 08:17.205
PLEASE...DON'T ASK
THE NEXT LOGICAL QUESTION.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.751
- JOY. THREE BACHELORS,

08:21.834 --> 08:23.794
ONE FINAL ROSE.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.922
TWO OF THESE MEN
WILL LEAVE TONIGHT,

08:26.005 --> 08:28.382
UTTERLY DEVASTATED.

08:28.466 --> 08:32.260
THIS IS MORE LIKE IT.

08:32.345 --> 08:34.429
- I NEEDED SOME TIME TO THINK,

08:34.514 --> 08:36.432
SO MY FRIENDS WENT BACK
TO THEIR DATES.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.986
- [clears throat]

08:49.070 --> 08:52.114
- SORRY, [laughs]
LAST MINUTE CRAM SESSION.

08:52.198 --> 08:56.077
SO, HOW WERE MY HANDS?
- OH, TERRIFIC.

08:56.160 --> 08:57.828
- MM-HMM?
- YOU REALLY PAINTED THE ENTIRE

08:57.912 --> 09:00.122
CANVAS OF MY BACK BEAUTIFULLY.
- [exhales] WELL.

09:00.206 --> 09:05.127
- WHEN WE STARTED, BRIAN WAS
A LITTLE SAME-SPOT-SALLY.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.421
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I THINK THE TWO
OF US CAN TAKE IT FROM HERE.

09:07.505 --> 09:10.174
- OH! OKAY.
- UH...

09:10.258 --> 09:13.094
- DON'T BE NERVOUS.
I'LL BE AT THE BAR.

09:13.177 --> 09:17.014
- UM...

09:17.098 --> 09:19.350
OH, THIS IS GONNA BE WEIRD,

09:19.433 --> 09:22.937
DOING IT WITHOUT MARCY.

09:23.020 --> 09:26.649
- IT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD DOING IT
WITH MARCY.

09:26.732 --> 09:28.776
SO, ARE YOU ORIGINALLY
FROM CLEVELAND?

09:28.859 --> 09:29.819
- I LOVE HER, MELANIE!

09:29.902 --> 09:33.698
- WHAT?
- I LOVE MARCY!

09:33.781 --> 09:36.367
I STARTED HAVING SEX WITH HER
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE WITH YOU,

09:36.450 --> 09:38.828
BUT, THEN
THE STRANGEST THING HAPPENED.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.497
I STARTED HAVING FEELINGS
FOR THE PERSON

09:41.580 --> 09:43.291
I WAS HAVING SEX WITH.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.544
YEAH, BUT,
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.

09:46.627 --> 09:50.339
I'M ON A DATE WITH YOU, SO--

09:50.423 --> 09:52.341
DO YOU HAVE ANY HOBBIES?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.217
- YEAH, DON'T EVEN.

09:53.301 --> 09:56.637
- ALL RIGHT.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.805
- SO, IN A FEW WEEKS,

09:57.888 --> 10:01.809
THE NOSE WILL BE HARVESTED,

10:01.892 --> 10:05.646
AND, YOU'LL BE
YOUR HOT SELF AGAIN.

10:05.730 --> 10:09.358
- ACTUALLY, I'VE DECIDED I, UH,
I HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY

10:09.442 --> 10:12.403
TO LET MY FERTILE FOREHEAD
SERVE HUMANITY.

10:14.905 --> 10:17.033
- I--I'M SORRY, WHAT?

10:17.116 --> 10:19.285
- YEAH, SEE THIS LITTLE GUY
RIGHT HERE?

10:21.537 --> 10:22.705
- IN 18 MONTHS,
THAT'S GONNA BE

10:22.788 --> 10:26.000
A FULL-GROWN EAR.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.052
- THE MORE I DRINK,
THE LESS CRAZY IT SEEMS

10:36.135 --> 10:38.763
THAT YOU BECAME A WOMAN!
- both: [laugh]

10:38.846 --> 10:41.557
- WELL, YOU REMEMBER
OUR TOWN'S MOTTO...

10:41.640 --> 10:44.852
"DRINK UNTIL IT MAKES SENSE."

10:47.104 --> 10:49.065
- MMM...AH.

10:49.148 --> 10:52.568
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE
MY STANISLAUS.

10:52.651 --> 10:56.572
- OH, I AM. THE SAME PERSON
THAT SAT IN THE OX CART WITH YOU

10:56.655 --> 11:00.034
IN THE MOONLIGHT.
- both: [laugh]

11:00.117 --> 11:02.244
- THAT'S WHERE WE SHARED
OUR FIRST KISS!

11:02.328 --> 11:05.956
- YOU WERE THE ONLY WOMAN
I EVER LOVED.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.254
- I GUESS YOU WERE
THE ONLY "VOMAN"

11:12.338 --> 11:14.965
I EVER LOVED, TOO.

11:19.720 --> 11:23.099
- LOOK, YOU'RE THREE
AMAZING MEN, AND, HOPEFULLY

11:23.182 --> 11:25.643
WE CAN GET THROUGH THIS WITHOUT
TOO MANY HURT FEELINGS.

11:25.726 --> 11:28.437
- OBVIOUSLY THIS SITUATION IS
A POTENTIAL MINEFIELD,

11:28.521 --> 11:30.314
SO LET'S AGREE FROM THE START...

11:30.398 --> 11:34.110
SEPARATE CHECKS?

11:34.193 --> 11:37.822
- LOOK, JOY, THIS IS INSANE.
I'M YOUR BOYFRIEND.

11:37.905 --> 11:40.074
I INVITED YOU HERE
TO PROPOSE TO YOU.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.159
FROM THE MOMENT WE MET,
YOU SAID I WAS THE MAN

11:42.243 --> 11:43.244
YOU WANTED TO MARRY.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.080
- YES, AND THEN YOU IMMEDIATELY
STARTED CAVORTING

11:46.163 --> 11:48.165
WITH HER FRIEND, MELANIE.
- THAT'S TRUE.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.960
- BUT, I PROPOSED FIRST.
- ACTUALLY, I PROPOSED FIRST.

11:51.043 --> 11:53.462
WE HAVE A CHILD, AND A
GRANDCHILD, TOGETHER.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.423
AND--AND YOU ALWAYS SAID THAT
I'M THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.675
IF ANYONE'S DESTINED
TO BE WITH YOU FOREVER, IT'S ME.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.469
- YEAH, YOU'D BETTER MOVE FAST.
KNOWING SIMON, YOU'LL SAY "YES,"

12:00.553 --> 12:04.598
AND HE'LL BE ON THE FIRST PLANE
TO CAN'T-COMMIT-ISTAN.

12:04.682 --> 12:08.352
- MITCH MAKES AN EXCELLENT POINT
ABOUT HOW AWFUL SIMON IS.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.813
- CAN WE JUST GET RID OF BOB,
AND NARROW THE FIELD

12:10.896 --> 12:12.648
TO THE REAL CONTENDERS?
- AGREED.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.692
- HEY, I THOUGHT WE HAD
AN ALLIANCE.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.027
- WHY WOULD WE HAVE AN ALLIANCE?

12:17.111 --> 12:19.321
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.
IF THE GLOVES ARE OFF,

12:19.405 --> 12:23.117
I SUGGEST YOU KICK SCOTTY
AND FATSO, HERE, TO THE CURB.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.870
- HEY, I'M NOT FAT ANYMORE.
- OH, I DON'T KNOW,

12:25.953 --> 12:28.456
THOSE POUNDS ARE COMING BACK.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.790
- SHUT UP.
- YOU SHUT UP!

12:29.874 --> 12:32.168
- BOTH OF YOU SHUT UP.
RIGHT, JOY?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.171
- OKAY.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.299
OBVIOUSLY THIS
GROUP DATE WAS A TERRIBLE IDEA.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.719
WHY DON'T I TALK TO EACH ONE
OF YOU SEPARATELY?

12:41.802 --> 12:44.680
- MAY THE BEST MAN WIN.
- OR THE FUNNIEST.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.559
- OR THE TALLEST AND SMARTEST
AND HANDSOMEST.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.854
OR, JUST THE TALLEST
AND SMARTEST.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.198
- SO, YOU'RE STILL CONSIDERING
ALL THREE OF THEM, EVEN BOB?

13:02.281 --> 13:05.534
- YES, EVEN BOB.
I LIKE HIM.

13:05.618 --> 13:09.497
- AND HE LIKES YOU.
WHICH PUTS HIM AHEAD OF MY DATE,

13:09.580 --> 13:11.540
WHO'S IN LOVE
WITH HIS SEXUAL SURROGATE.

13:11.624 --> 13:12.875
IT'S SO STRANGE!

13:12.958 --> 13:16.545
- IS IT, MELANIE?

13:16.629 --> 13:18.047
STRANGER THAN A MAN
WITH TWO NOSES,

13:18.130 --> 13:21.717
AND AN EXTRA EAR?

13:21.800 --> 13:26.180
I AM ON A DATE
WITH MR. POTATO HEAD.

13:26.263 --> 13:28.390
- WELL, I'D BETTER
GET BACK OUT THERE,

13:28.474 --> 13:30.559
AND MAKE THE BIGGEST DECISION
OF MY LIFE.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.522
- JOY? CHOOSE A GOOD ONE.
YOU DESERVE IT.

13:34.605 --> 13:38.359
- OKAY, I'M WAITING.
WHERE'S THE INSULT?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.903
I'VE GOT NO BOOBS, I'M OLD,
I'M SKANKY...

13:40.986 --> 13:43.822
- I'M SAVING THOSE
FOR YOUR WEDDING TOAST.

13:48.827 --> 13:51.539
- BOB, YOU'RE A TERRIFIC GUY.
BUT, WE'VE NEVER EVEN BEEN

13:51.622 --> 13:54.416
ON A DATE.
MARRIAGE SEEMS QUITE THE LEAP.

13:54.500 --> 13:58.420
- FINE, FORGET ME.
FOCUS ON YOUR OTHER TWO SUITORS.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.047
LET'S FACE IT,
BOTH MITCH AND SIMON

14:00.130 --> 14:02.299
ARE GONNA LOSE THEIR LOOKS.
WHERE AS I?

14:02.383 --> 14:05.719
WILL LOOK LIKE THIS FOREVER.

14:05.803 --> 14:07.888
WELL, AS LONG AS
SHOPPERS DRUG MART CONTINUES

14:07.972 --> 14:11.892
TO MAKE "APRICOT KISS FOAM-IN
HAIR COLOR, FOR MEN."

14:11.976 --> 14:15.563
- STOP MAKING ME LAUGH.
- WHY, JOY? YOU LOVE TO LAUGH.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.108
I COULD GUARANTEE YOU
A LIFETIME OF LAUGHTER.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.820
JOY, I'VE BEEN IN LOVE WITH YOU
FROM THE FIRST MOMENT I MET YOU.

14:22.903 --> 14:25.948
- BUT, WHAT ABOUT
YOUR GIRLFRIEND IN CANADA?

14:26.031 --> 14:28.075
ARE YOU SURE THAT'S OVER?

14:28.158 --> 14:29.743
- HER LAST WORDS TO ME WERE,

14:29.827 --> 14:33.455
"GET OUT OF HERE, YOU BIG DICK."

14:33.539 --> 14:34.915
- I'M SORRY.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.002
- FOCUS ON THE LAST TWO WORDS,
JOY.

14:38.085 --> 14:41.755
- [laughs]

14:41.839 --> 14:44.842
- I LOVE JOY SO MUCH.
SHE SHOULD BE WITH ME.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.468
IT'S AS PLAIN THE NOSE ON MY--

14:46.552 --> 14:49.471
HOLY CRAP!

14:49.555 --> 14:52.641
- YOU OBVIOUSLY RECOGNIZE ME
FROM <i> CLEVELAND MAGAZINE.</i>

14:52.725 --> 14:56.520
- YEAH, THAT'S IT.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.608
- WHAT DO I DO IF JOY DOESN'T
PICK ME?

15:00.691 --> 15:02.276
I'LL BE LOST,
I'LL BE DEVASTATED,

15:02.359 --> 15:04.278
I--I WON'T BE ABLE TO GO ON.

15:04.361 --> 15:07.156
- LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.
WERE YOU ALWAYS A MAN?

15:10.534 --> 15:12.620
- YOU COULD ALWAYS
MAKE ME SMILE.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.289
- OH, ELKA.
IF ONLY YOU WERE A MAN.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.459
- I WAS JUST ABOUT TO SAY
THE SAME THING.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.799
- WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON,
HERE?

15:25.883 --> 15:29.637
- JOY, YOU MEAN THE WORLD TO ME.
WE'RE SOUL MATES.

15:29.720 --> 15:33.349
EVEN AFTER I LOST 300 POUNDS,
I WOULD LOOK AT MYSELF

15:33.432 --> 15:35.976
IN THE MIRROR,
AND I WOULD SEE A FAT GUY.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.896
BUT YOUR LOVE HAS GIVEN ME
THE CONFIDENCE TO SEE MYSELF

15:38.979 --> 15:40.648
FOR WHO I TRULY AM...

15:40.731 --> 15:42.733
A VERY HANDSOME MAN.

15:42.816 --> 15:44.026
- MITCH.

15:44.109 --> 15:48.030
- I'M VERY HANDSOME, JOY.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.658
BORDERLINE PRETTY.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.204
- YOU REALLY ARE.
- AND YOU ARE...

15:55.287 --> 15:59.041
A LITTLE SHALLOW, RIGHT?
- MORE THAN A LITTLE.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.669
- THEN PICTURE WAKING UP
FOR THE NEXT 50 YEARS

16:01.752 --> 16:05.089
NEXT TO SIMON, OR BOB,
OR, WAKING UP...

16:05.172 --> 16:09.385
NEXT TO THIS.

16:09.468 --> 16:11.178
- YOU MAKE A LOT OF SENSE,
MITCH.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.515
A LOT OF SENSE.

16:14.598 --> 16:18.060
- SO, MARCY. BRIAN AND I HAVE
BEEN, UM, TALKING,

16:18.143 --> 16:19.853
AND HE HAS SOMETHING THAT
HE WOULD LIKE TO SAY TO YOU.

16:19.937 --> 16:20.938
BRIAN?

16:21.021 --> 16:24.525
- YES. MARCY, UH, I, YOU SEE--

16:24.608 --> 16:26.777
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT. MELANIE?
- WHAT?

16:26.860 --> 16:28.737
- I NEED YOUR HELP TO WIN JOY.
ANYTHING THAT WILL MAKE HER

16:28.821 --> 16:30.239
WANT ME OVER ALL OTHER MEN.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.241
- MAYBE I CAN HELP.
BY HAVING SEX WITH ME,

16:32.324 --> 16:33.283
YOU'LL BECOME A BETTER LOVER.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.787
-YOU HAVE MY ATTENTION.

16:36.870 --> 16:40.082
- NO, I--I--I DON'T WANT YOU
HAVING SEX WITH ANYBODY BUT ME.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.460
- I'M FLATTERED, BUT--

16:43.544 --> 16:46.088
- NOT YOU, HER.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.424
HE'S IN LOVE WITH HER.

16:48.507 --> 16:51.427
- IS THIS TRUE?
- YES, MARCY.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.221
- SO, WHEN I TAUGHT YOU TO
CALL OUT MELANIE'S NAME,

16:54.304 --> 16:56.098
YOU--YOU ACTUALLY WANTED
TO CALL OUT MINE?

16:56.181 --> 16:58.934
- [laughing] YES.
NO, I ONLY THOUGHT OF MELANIE

16:59.017 --> 17:01.437
WHEN I NEEDED TO DISTRACT MYSELF
TO MAKE IT LAST LONGER.

17:01.520 --> 17:04.940
- OH!

17:05.022 --> 17:07.401
- SOMETIMES I'D THINK OF
HER RADIO SHOW, AND...

17:07.483 --> 17:10.738
I COULD LAST ALL NIGHT.

17:10.820 --> 17:14.241
- I'M GONNA NEED TAPE
OF YOUR SHOW.

17:14.324 --> 17:17.077
- SO, TREVOR, YOU'RE A MODEL.
HOW DO GOOD-LOOKING GUYS,

17:17.161 --> 17:19.788
LIKE US, WIN A WOMAN?

17:19.872 --> 17:23.416
- IT'S NOT ABOUT THE LOOKS.
IF YOU REALLY WANNA CAPTURE

17:23.500 --> 17:25.669
JOY'S HEART,
DO SOMETHING HUMANITARIAN.

17:25.752 --> 17:28.797
WOMEN LOVE THAT.
- DO THEY?

17:28.881 --> 17:32.509
- WELL, YEAH. AND YOU ONLY KNOW
ABOUT THE EAR AND THE NOSE.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.887
YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT I GOT

17:34.970 --> 17:37.306
GROWING ON MY BACK.

17:37.389 --> 17:40.350
YOU'LL SEE.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.686
- WILL IT SEE ME?

17:42.770 --> 17:45.689
TELL ME NOW.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.817
- YOU DID A GOOD THING, MELANIE.
- YEAH, I DID, DIDN'T I?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.945
- WHY ARE WE STILL SITTING HERE?

17:52.029 --> 17:54.156
AND WHERE'S MITCH GOING?
IT'S NOT HIS TURN.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.367
- CAN I GET YOU ANOTHER DRINK?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.787
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

18:03.749 --> 18:07.669
- JOY. WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,
I SEE THE TEENAGE GIRL

18:07.753 --> 18:11.131
I FELL IN LOVE WITH. AND THAT'S
WHO I'M ALWAYS GONNA SEE.

18:11.215 --> 18:14.176
- REALLY?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.847
- DANCING?

18:18.931 --> 18:22.184
I DIDN'T KNOW
THERE'D BE A DANCING PORTION.

18:22.267 --> 18:26.105
- LET GO OF HER.
- NO, YOU LET GO OF HER.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.523
- SHE'S MINE.
- SHE'S MINE!

18:27.606 --> 18:29.233
- STOP IT! ALL OF YOU!

18:34.196 --> 18:35.739
- OH MY GOD.

18:41.912 --> 18:45.207
- THIS HAS BEEN QUITE A JOURNEY
FOR YOU, JOY.

18:45.290 --> 18:49.044
HAVE YOU MADE YOUR DECISION?
- I THINK I HAVE.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.963
I CHOOSE--

18:51.046 --> 18:54.508
I CHOOSE...

18:54.591 --> 18:57.010
WAIT A MINUTE,

18:57.094 --> 18:58.554
YOU'RE NOT CHRIS HARRISON.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.514
- YOU'VE HAD A BAD BUMP,
SWEETIE.

19:00.597 --> 19:03.892
YOU NEED TO LIE
QUIET FOR A WHILE.

19:03.976 --> 19:07.187
- I FEEL TERRIBLE.
I'VE NEVER HIT A WOMAN BEFORE.

19:07.271 --> 19:10.566
- ME EITHER...
EXCEPT THE TIME AN ELBOW

19:10.649 --> 19:14.570
GOT AWAY FROM ME IN ZUMBA CLASS.

19:14.653 --> 19:15.904
- CHEER UP, SIMON.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.448
IF JOY DOESN'T PICK YOU...

19:18.532 --> 19:21.869
I'M RIGHT HERE.

19:21.952 --> 19:23.871
- YOU KNOW BOB, I'VE ALWAYS
THOUGHT YOU WERE KINDA CUTE.

19:23.954 --> 19:25.080
I'D GO OUT WITH YOU.

19:25.163 --> 19:27.624
- KEEP IT IN YOUR PANTS,
MELANIE.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.877
I'M IN LOVE WITH JOY.

19:29.960 --> 19:33.755
- WHAT A NICE NIGHT IT'S BEEN.

19:33.839 --> 19:36.800
- IT WAS GREAT TO SEE STAN
AGAIN, BUT...

19:36.884 --> 19:38.927
I REALLY HAD A FEELING
I WAS GONNA

19:39.011 --> 19:40.721
MEET A SPECIAL MAN TONIGHT.

19:43.891 --> 19:45.601
- ELKA?

19:45.684 --> 19:49.271
- MAX! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

19:49.354 --> 19:50.939
- I THOUGHT I WAS
HAVING HEART TROUBLE.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.942
BUT IT WAS NOTHING.
ALTHOUGH, NOW,

19:54.026 --> 19:56.320
IT'S STARTING TO RACE AGAIN.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.614
- [laughs] IS IT?

19:58.697 --> 20:02.451
- YOU KNOW, I'M JUST VISITING
FROM FLORIDA,

20:02.534 --> 20:05.454
I'M NOT STAYING VERY LONG, BUT,
UH, WOULD YOU, UH--

20:05.537 --> 20:08.582
- YES!
- AND MAYBE TOMORROW?

20:08.665 --> 20:11.919
- YES.
- AND THERE WAS SOMETHING ELSE

20:12.002 --> 20:14.338
I WANTED TO ASK YOU...UH...

20:14.421 --> 20:17.090
- WHEN YOU REMEMBER IT, YES.

20:19.551 --> 20:23.180
- OKAY, SHE'S DOING FINE.
SHE JUST NEEDS TO REST.

20:23.263 --> 20:24.514
- DID SHE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT
WHICH MAN

20:24.598 --> 20:26.016
SHE WAS GOING TO MARRY?

20:26.099 --> 20:28.644
- SHE'S IN NO CONDITION TO BE
MAKING LIFE DECISIONS.

20:28.727 --> 20:32.230
- THEN, I...GUESS EVERYONE
IS JUST GONNA HAVE TO WAIT.
