WEBVTT

00:03.612 --> 00:05.135
Alright!

00:05.222 --> 00:08.791
I got all the supplies
from the hardware store.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.967
I thought you were going to
prep and measure the walls.

00:11.054 --> 00:14.014
Well, I started to, but then I
found your high school yearbook

00:14.101 --> 00:16.712
and it's a real page-turner.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.192
Can't wait to see how it ends.

00:18.279 --> 00:20.237
Yeah, I graduate,
I get my teaching degree

00:20.324 --> 00:23.066
and then I marry
Lazy Bones Jones.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.720
This is a nice picture
of you though.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.635
Who would expect the captain
of the debate club

00:26.722 --> 00:28.245
to have such a rocking mullet?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.508
It is not a mullet.

00:30.595 --> 00:32.075
I was going through
a prince phase.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.250
Really?

00:33.337 --> 00:35.339
Charles or Albert?

00:35.426 --> 00:36.862
You want to talk hairstyles?

00:36.949 --> 00:39.474
I've seen your prom picture,
Buzz Lightyear.

00:39.561 --> 00:43.260
Hey, it's the same exact
haircut I have now.

00:43.347 --> 00:45.828
Yes, it is.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.309
Well, I'm certainly not
going to cross verbal swords

00:48.396 --> 00:51.181
with the girl voted "most likely
to tell you you're wrong."

00:51.268 --> 00:52.835
Seriously,
if we don't get cracking

00:52.922 --> 00:54.706
we're never going to make it
livable for us down here.

00:54.793 --> 00:56.056
Don't worry, we'll get it done.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.580
You know my motto,
"Do it right, do it once."

00:58.667 --> 00:59.929
I thought your motto was,
"There's always room

01:00.016 --> 01:01.713
for Jell-O."

01:01.800 --> 01:04.934
Hey, a guy can have more than
one motto. What's it read?

01:05.021 --> 01:07.980
Ten feet, five inches
and one, two, 3/16ths.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.026
- Can you write that down?
- I can remember it.

01:10.113 --> 01:13.247
- What's my phone number?
- You got a pencil?

01:13.334 --> 01:14.422
By the saw.

01:14.509 --> 01:15.945
We'll slap this
paneling up quicker

01:16.032 --> 01:17.860
than you can say
"little red Corvette."

01:17.947 --> 01:20.080
Don't push it, Buzz.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.994
Hey, uh, what was that
measurement again?

01:22.082 --> 01:24.040
I don't know, that's why
I want you to write it down.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.302
Well, what's it say now?

01:25.389 --> 01:27.870
Now, 12 feet, six inches.

01:27.957 --> 01:30.394
Well, I'm guessing I walked
about three feet, seven inches

01:30.481 --> 01:31.700
give or take.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.615
Mike, can you please
measure it again?

01:33.702 --> 01:35.834
You know, measure twice,
cut once.

01:35.921 --> 01:39.403
That's just for cake. Something
like this you can eyeball.

01:39.490 --> 01:41.231
What are we doing?
We're never gonna finish this.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.015
We should hire a professional.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.322
Why? You're married
to a first-class handyman.

01:45.409 --> 01:46.758
Who fixed that hole in the roof?

01:46.845 --> 01:48.717
You did. Same hole three times.

01:48.804 --> 01:50.284
No, same hole twice.

01:50.371 --> 01:51.807
The other hole was
where my foot went through.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.983
And that patchwork
is holding up very nicely.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.899
Perhaps it's the all-weather
boot that you left stuck in it.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.728
Point being, I fixed it.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.382
Now let's get
this show on the road.

02:03.384 --> 02:05.908
- What'd you do with the pencil?
- By the saw.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.127
We're going to have to
hire somebody just to

02:07.214 --> 02:09.955
keep track of the pencil.

02:10.042 --> 02:12.001
♪ For the first time ♪

02:12.088 --> 02:15.483
♪ In my life ♪

02:15.570 --> 02:18.399
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:28.322 --> 02:29.801
[doorbell rings]

02:32.717 --> 02:34.284
Hey, come on in.

02:34.371 --> 02:35.807
- What happened to your hand?
- Oh, it's nothing.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.505
I'm doing some home
improvements at the house

02:37.592 --> 02:41.030
and I sliced my thumb
cutting an apple.

02:41.117 --> 02:43.728
You got no business
working with tools or knives.

02:43.815 --> 02:47.254
The only thing you can build
is a hamburger at Fuddruckers.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.951
At least I can do
my own laundry.

02:49.038 --> 02:50.909
I don't have to come over to my
grandma's to get her to do it.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.521
Hey, I came over to check in on
that helpless, poor, old woman.

02:53.608 --> 02:56.176
Excuse me for being
an exemplary grandson.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.221
Listen, SpongeBob BrownPants.

03:00.136 --> 03:01.877
What's the point of
getting you out of my house

03:01.964 --> 03:04.227
if I still got to handle
your dirty drawers?

03:04.314 --> 03:06.229
Grandma, how many times
do I got to tell you?

03:06.316 --> 03:08.797
I like my underpants tri-folded,
like little flags.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.190
Not just rolled up!

03:10.277 --> 03:12.583
Those crusty things
roll up all on their own.

03:14.411 --> 03:16.283
Like the dead witch's feet
and the "Wizard of Oz."

03:16.370 --> 03:17.893
I just..

03:17.980 --> 03:19.329
Carl, we should probably
get out of here.

03:19.416 --> 03:21.679
You're not wearing
your bulletproof vest.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.073
Michael, do you still
go to your mama's house

03:24.160 --> 03:26.075
expecting her to fix you dinner

03:26.162 --> 03:28.599
do your laundry and shave
the back of your neck?

03:28.686 --> 03:30.732
No, but part of that's me
not wanting my mom

03:30.819 --> 03:33.213
standing behind me
with a razor in her hand.

03:33.300 --> 03:36.477
He's not nearly as
nervous as he should be.

03:36.564 --> 03:38.261
I'll be over later tonight
to check on you

03:38.348 --> 03:40.220
make sure you're okay and
that you've taken your medicine.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.440
The only pills I take are
for the headache yougive me.

03:43.527 --> 03:45.137
And you're not coming here
to check on me

03:45.225 --> 03:46.443
you just wanna steal my food.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.053
You steal her food?

03:48.140 --> 03:49.359
The grocery was closed,
and I'm not paying

03:49.446 --> 03:50.752
liquor store prices.

03:52.362 --> 03:54.538
Came home another night
and found nothin' in the

03:54.625 --> 03:56.801
Frigidaire
but my milk of magnesia

03:56.888 --> 03:58.673
and a half-eaten radish.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.545
Yeah, always forget I hate
radishes until I bite into one.

04:01.632 --> 04:03.025
Get him out of here right now

04:03.112 --> 04:04.983
before you're witness
to a black-on-black

04:05.070 --> 04:06.376
foot-in-ass crime!

04:08.944 --> 04:10.902
Remember to check my shirt
sleeves for dryer sheets.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.121
I've been pulling
those things out of my

04:12.208 --> 04:13.601
cuffs like a damn magician!

04:13.688 --> 04:15.080
Boy, you better disappear

04:15.167 --> 04:17.082
before I saw you in half.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.913
I-I know it's out of
my way to come by here

04:22.000 --> 04:23.219
but it's always worth it
when I see

04:23.306 --> 04:25.482
that big smile on her face.

04:25.569 --> 04:29.399
And quit leaving your
pornography in my DVD player!

04:29.486 --> 04:32.315
I sat down to watch "The View"
and got one I'll never forget.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.281
Boy, for a guy
with his own apartment

04:41.368 --> 04:43.370
you sure spend a lot
of time at your grandma's.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.720
Hey, she's an old woman
and she misses me.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.940
I'm trying to wean her off me
slowly, like methadone.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.116
Right, look, if you're lonely,
maybe you should

04:51.203 --> 04:52.553
get a dog or a plant.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.251
You know, something that
has to love you back.

04:55.338 --> 04:56.818
First of all, I'm not lonely.

04:56.905 --> 04:59.168
And secondly, a dog
doesn't guarantee you love.

04:59.255 --> 05:01.605
I've had three run off on me.
One of them left me for a hobo.

05:03.346 --> 05:04.652
- You're kidding.
- No.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.262
I saw him on the street
a week later.

05:06.349 --> 05:09.265
Acted like
he didn't even know me.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.007
Aloof as hell.

05:12.094 --> 05:14.009
Write down what you want
to eat and make it legible.

05:14.096 --> 05:15.837
No pointing and grunting
at the menu, I'm too tired.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.360
Wow, Carl, I wrong.

05:17.447 --> 05:21.059
Service in here
actually could be crappier.

05:21.146 --> 05:22.539
I'm going on no sleep.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.236
My roommate Aziz
moved his crazy wife

05:24.324 --> 05:25.934
and screaming baby into
our apartment, so there are now

05:26.021 --> 05:27.675
seven people
living in a one-bedroom!

05:27.762 --> 05:29.807
Three of them are telemarketers
who work from home!

05:33.463 --> 05:35.160
Hey, why don't you ask Samuel
to move in with you?

05:35.247 --> 05:36.814
You got that extra room
at your place.

05:36.901 --> 05:39.208
I'm gonna turn that
into my meditation dojo.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.602
Yeah, a place where I can
reflect and hear myself think.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.299
I hear you thinking
all day long.

05:43.386 --> 05:47.085
Believe me, you don't want to be
trapped in a room with that.

05:47.172 --> 05:48.826
Hey, I like Samuel

05:48.913 --> 05:50.698
but I don't want to
live with a guy.

05:50.785 --> 05:52.874
You find a chick's pubes
in your soap, that's sexy.

05:52.961 --> 05:55.485
But another dude? You got to
throw away the whole bar.

05:57.313 --> 05:58.836
Those are the kind of
little things you can work out

05:58.923 --> 06:00.838
between the two of you.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.579
I don't know,
I like living on my own.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.538
I don't need another person
cramping my style.

06:04.625 --> 06:07.454
Yeah, and by style, you mean
doing Tai Chi in your towel wrap

06:07.541 --> 06:10.979
and masturbating
in front of your TV?

06:11.066 --> 06:12.459
And where else
would you have me masturbate?

06:12.546 --> 06:15.418
In front of a window?

06:15.505 --> 06:17.986
You wonder why that dog
left you for that hobo.

06:23.339 --> 06:26.037
Don't you mention Tippy to me.

06:26.124 --> 06:28.257
I took him off death row
and gave him a home.

06:28.344 --> 06:31.434
He caught that frisbee
and kept running.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.349
He was sending a message.

06:33.436 --> 06:35.525
I loved him,
but Tippy was a vindictive

06:35.612 --> 06:37.266
little son of a bitch.

06:42.227 --> 06:43.968
You did a nice job on that

06:44.055 --> 06:45.927
framing-ma-jiggy.

06:46.014 --> 06:47.755
Those are called furring strips.

06:47.842 --> 06:50.627
Gives you a nice, level surface
to attach the paneling to.

06:50.714 --> 06:53.151
Well, I'm very impressed.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.502
Can I play with the glue gun?

06:55.589 --> 06:58.243
No, you may not.
This is a tool, not a toy.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.767
Really? Because you just wrote

06:59.854 --> 07:02.683
"Mike is cool" with the glue.

07:02.770 --> 07:04.511
First of all, it's called epoxy.

07:04.598 --> 07:07.383
And second of all, Mike is cool.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.167
Well, I'm cool, too.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.040
I know, I read it in your
yearbook, like, five times.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.258
Here.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.086
- Molly..
- Uh-huh.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.219
- Is..
- Mm-hmm.

07:17.306 --> 07:18.699
- Cool.
- Thanks.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.744
So, what do we do now?
Slap this baby up there?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.224
No, we're not gonna
slap anything.

07:22.311 --> 07:24.095
We're gonna carefully
apply the epoxied

07:24.182 --> 07:25.401
surface to the frame.

07:25.488 --> 07:27.316
Okay.

07:27.403 --> 07:30.058
- Oh.
- Alright.

07:30.145 --> 07:32.060
How long's it take
this glue to dry?

07:32.147 --> 07:34.149
We have to hold it in place
for about ten minutes.

07:34.236 --> 07:36.630
Grab that block of wood
so we can tap it into place.

07:40.068 --> 07:41.722
I thought you said
it takes ten minutes?

07:41.809 --> 07:44.289
That's for wood, not gloves.
Yank it off of there.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.422
Otherwise, we're gonna have
to hang a picture over it.

07:51.079 --> 07:54.386
Oh, wow. Good glue, bad wood.

07:54.474 --> 07:56.476
Grab the gun!
I'll hold this in place.

07:58.565 --> 08:02.046
Damn it, that ten-minute thing
is a load of crap!

08:02.133 --> 08:04.396
- Oh!
- Aah!

08:04.484 --> 08:07.225
- It's in my eye!
- I gave you safety goggles!

08:07.312 --> 08:08.966
- Here, let me get it.
- Hurry, it's hardening!

08:09.053 --> 08:11.012
I can feel it!

08:13.667 --> 08:15.495
I'm gonna go
make you a sandwich!

08:15.582 --> 08:17.409
Wait! Where are you going?

08:17.497 --> 08:19.977
Molly! Molly!

08:26.114 --> 08:27.071
[knock on door]

08:27.158 --> 08:28.899
I got it, roomie.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.382
Hey, man, come on in.

08:33.469 --> 08:34.862
What's different about you?

08:34.949 --> 08:35.993
Did you finally get
a new haircut?

08:36.080 --> 08:38.953
I'm missing an eyebrow,
Sherlock!

08:39.040 --> 08:40.911
That's what it is.

08:40.998 --> 08:42.652
Word to the wise,
when you got a glove

08:42.739 --> 08:44.045
glued to your face,
don't tell your wife

08:44.132 --> 08:46.134
to just yank it off.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.570
You should've let her
yank off the other one.

08:47.657 --> 08:50.268
You look weird this way.

08:50.355 --> 08:52.532
Believe me, we debated
about that for a long time

08:52.619 --> 08:54.708
and this is where we landed.

08:54.795 --> 08:58.320
Alright, I folded
your undies like little flags.

08:58.407 --> 08:59.887
Tonight, I will wash
your colors and delicates

08:59.974 --> 09:01.671
when I get home from work.

09:01.758 --> 09:03.717
See, now, if you had gotten up
earlier like I told you to

09:03.804 --> 09:05.893
you could have finished
all of it.

09:05.980 --> 09:08.112
Well, I was up pretty late
ironing your work shirts

09:08.199 --> 09:10.724
and shaving
the back of your neck.

09:10.811 --> 09:12.421
You get the line even
the first time

09:12.508 --> 09:13.814
then you won't have to
do it over again.

09:13.901 --> 09:14.858
Grandma used to draw it in first

09:14.945 --> 09:16.730
with a little eyebrow pencil.

09:18.340 --> 09:20.821
I'll remember that
for next time.

09:20.908 --> 09:22.649
No problem. I mean,
you just moved in.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.042
We're still discovering each
other's little peccadillos.

09:26.870 --> 09:29.046
Indeed, we are.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.570
By the way,
I was thinking tonight

09:30.657 --> 09:31.875
you could cook pork chops.

09:31.962 --> 09:34.399
- Kind of in a pig mood.
- More than usual.

09:37.011 --> 09:38.621
Man, you were right,
letting Sammy move

09:38.708 --> 09:40.405
in here was a great idea.

09:40.492 --> 09:42.190
It really feels good
to help out a friend.

09:42.277 --> 09:45.280
Still, I'd be careful
biting into those pork chops.

09:52.461 --> 09:53.897
You should hire a guy for this.

09:53.984 --> 09:55.638
It'd be done by now
and you wouldn't look like

09:55.725 --> 09:58.772
an unfinished, Mr. Potato Head.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.556
Just pipe down
and make sure it's level.

10:00.643 --> 10:02.427
Looks level to me,
but, of course

10:02.514 --> 10:03.777
my view might be obscured

10:03.864 --> 10:07.128
by my two lush eyebrows.

10:07.215 --> 10:08.608
Ah, crap,
why didn't you tell me

10:08.695 --> 10:10.479
there was a two-inch gap
between them?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.612
You didn't ask me
if there was a two-inch gap!

10:12.699 --> 10:13.961
You asked me if it was level!

10:14.048 --> 10:16.137
Which it is. You're welcome.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.489
Why would I want a giant gap
between the panels?

10:20.576 --> 10:22.839
Why would you glue
a glove to your face?

10:22.926 --> 10:25.886
This project is raising
a lot of questions.

10:28.323 --> 10:31.239
Thank you for your helpful
insight. I'll take it from here.

10:31.326 --> 10:33.502
You're the one who lassoed me
into this barn raising.

10:33.589 --> 10:36.026
I only came down here to
take a dump in private.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.246
Yeah, which reminds me,
when Molly and I

10:38.333 --> 10:40.552
are living down here,
that toilet is off limits.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.121
You need to go to a hospital,
not the bathroom.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.689
One could argue, you're
projecting your anger at me

10:46.776 --> 10:50.127
because you're not
so much handy, as handicapped.

10:51.955 --> 10:54.741
I'm holding a hammer and
it might be glued to my hand.

10:56.003 --> 10:58.266
Oh, good,
you're off the crapper.

10:58.353 --> 11:01.617
I thought you strained
too hard and blew a valve.

11:01.704 --> 11:04.315
I barely got my pants up
before getting drafted by

11:04.402 --> 11:06.143
this old big as a house.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.233
Yeah, and you were
a tremendous help, too.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.801
There's not supposed to be a
big gap between them, is there?

11:11.888 --> 11:13.585
Don't point out his mistakes.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.109
He's horrible with criticism.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.113
Boy, the two of them are never
gonna move down here, are they?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.680
I'm working on it!

11:20.767 --> 11:22.290
"Working on it,"
If he nails everything

11:22.377 --> 11:23.552
the way he nails paneling

11:23.639 --> 11:25.554
we're never gonna see
any grandkids.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.338
One project at a time!

11:27.425 --> 11:29.471
[Vince]
'See?
You can't tell him anything!'

11:35.346 --> 11:37.914
[Mike]
'Damn it, line up,
you son of a bitch!'

11:39.481 --> 11:41.483
[hammering]
'Ow!'

11:41.570 --> 11:43.354
- Everything okay?
- 'Fine!'

11:43.441 --> 11:45.052
'Looking great!'

11:45.139 --> 11:47.663
'Damn it, it looks great!'

11:47.750 --> 11:49.404
[hammering continues]

11:49.491 --> 11:51.536
Worst-case scenario,
we brick up the basement

11:51.623 --> 11:53.974
and live in the garage.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.540
Well, he may not be any good

11:55.627 --> 11:57.368
but he's not a quitter.

11:57.455 --> 12:00.197
Kind of like you
and the baton twirling.

12:00.284 --> 12:01.242
What are you talking about?

12:01.329 --> 12:04.114
I-I was a baton master.

12:04.201 --> 12:07.422
They asked me to be in
the Fourth of July parade, so..

12:07.509 --> 12:09.119
I remember.

12:09.206 --> 12:12.819
You beaned that poor old
Shriner right in the fez.

12:12.906 --> 12:16.126
All those little cars
crashing into each other.

12:16.213 --> 12:18.912
Hey, I slipped
on horse manure, okay?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.609
[doorbell rings]

12:20.696 --> 12:22.611
That pile-up was
on the Buckaroo Club.

12:22.698 --> 12:25.614
Either diaper those things or
don't feed 'em the night before.

12:27.311 --> 12:28.922
Hey, Samuel. Come on.

12:29.009 --> 12:31.185
How's everything going
with Carl?

12:31.272 --> 12:33.970
It's kind of like
Whoopi Goldberg and Danny Glover

12:34.057 --> 12:37.408
in "The Color Purple."

12:37.495 --> 12:39.106
That movie always makes me cry.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.935
Yeah, I cried on
the bus ride over here.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.112
- Is Mike home?
- Yeah, downstairs.

12:45.199 --> 12:47.767
Just follow the "oh craps"
and "damn its."

12:47.854 --> 12:49.769
[Mike]
'Aw, crap! Damn it!'

12:51.422 --> 12:52.772
Thank you.

12:57.472 --> 13:00.954
If you're covering cracks,
you missed the big one.

13:01.041 --> 13:02.694
Damn it,
what are you doing here?

13:02.782 --> 13:04.522
Supposed to be getting Carl
a Peanut Buster Parfait

13:04.609 --> 13:07.743
and some bath beads.
He likes to snack in the tub.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.484
You don't have to
tell me everything.

13:09.571 --> 13:12.139
I like there being a little
mystery between me and Carl.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.358
He won't buy toilet paper
and insists

13:14.445 --> 13:16.708
I steal it from restaurants
and gas stations.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.449
He says he risks
his life every day

13:18.536 --> 13:20.321
the city owes him a clean ass.

13:22.149 --> 13:24.673
See, right there.
Happy without that information.

13:24.760 --> 13:26.588
- Grab that end, will you?
- Of course.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.938
How do you deal with
being around him all the time?

13:29.025 --> 13:31.288
Well, you just got to treat him
like a toddler or a dog.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.724
Say "no" and "down"

13:32.812 --> 13:35.945
and run him a lot
so he sleeps at night.

13:36.032 --> 13:37.773
Tack that up, will you?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.862
Alright.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.864
The important thing is
you stand up for yourself.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.561
It's your place, too.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.955
You're his roommate,
not his mail-order bride.

13:46.042 --> 13:47.435
Well, I am certainly
getting sick of doing

13:47.522 --> 13:49.437
"washy washy for Mr. Carl."

13:49.524 --> 13:50.873
Yeah, he's a handful.

13:50.960 --> 13:52.396
Give him an inch
and he'll take a mile.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.007
Go ahead and tack up
that other side

13:54.094 --> 13:55.835
since you got the hammer.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.010
Sure.

13:57.097 --> 13:58.054
Remember to keep the hammer

13:58.141 --> 14:00.056
centered and straight.

14:00.143 --> 14:02.885
And keep going. Momentum is
the key to finishing a project.

14:02.972 --> 14:05.540
Ooh, another motto.

14:05.627 --> 14:07.237
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna grab a beer.

14:07.324 --> 14:09.283
You can have one
when you're done.

14:13.156 --> 14:16.507
HBO, Cinemax, Showtime.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.684
The minute I move out, that old
woman buys the premium package.

14:19.771 --> 14:22.165
She better not be burning
through my inheritance.

14:22.252 --> 14:24.951
Sister Rosetta, you've got
the devil inside of you.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.866
Well, there's room enough
for both of you.

14:28.389 --> 14:30.739
O-oh, hell, no!

14:30.826 --> 14:32.132
Hey, grandma.

14:32.219 --> 14:34.177
When'd you start
buying Australian beer?

14:34.264 --> 14:36.266
There's a lovely peach
cobbler in the kitchen.

14:36.353 --> 14:39.661
Why don't you help yourself.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.968
Carlton, what do I
got to do to get rid of you?

14:42.055 --> 14:43.926
You're like a toe fungus!

14:45.623 --> 14:46.755
Grandma, you're an old woman

14:46.842 --> 14:47.930
and somebody's
got to take care of you.

14:48.017 --> 14:49.366
If you wasn't here right now

14:49.453 --> 14:51.064
I'd be upstairs
with Brother Heywood

14:51.151 --> 14:53.805
and he'd be
taking care of me good.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.938
Come on, grandma,
I got a belly full of cobbler.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.593
Boy, you got your own
apartment now and a roommate.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.248
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.728
'Cause you ain't got nobody
waiting on you hand and foot

15:03.815 --> 15:05.817
cooking your meals,
doing your laundry.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.732
Actually, I do,
and Samuel can fold

15:07.819 --> 15:09.169
a pair of underpants
better than you.

15:09.256 --> 15:11.736
My dresser drawer looks
like a military funeral!

15:11.823 --> 15:14.043
Well, if you got
Bushman Benson at home

15:14.130 --> 15:15.827
what you doing
sitting on my couch

15:15.915 --> 15:17.960
sucking down my imported beer?

15:21.616 --> 15:22.660
Being away from you
made me realize

15:22.747 --> 15:24.314
how much you done for me.

15:24.401 --> 15:25.707
And I'm not just talking about
cooking and cleaning

15:25.794 --> 15:27.404
and changing the oil in my car.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.102
Well, you're about due,
by the way.

15:29.189 --> 15:32.453
I put a little sticker
on your windshield.

15:32.540 --> 15:34.455
I saw it.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.760
You take good care
of me, grandma.

15:35.847 --> 15:37.719
I tookgood care of you.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.113
Now it's time for you
to take care of yourself.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.420
Alright, I understand.

15:45.292 --> 15:47.120
I'm sorry to bother you.

15:47.207 --> 15:49.383
How about this Sunday
you come over

15:49.470 --> 15:52.603
bring your laundry
and I'll make you a nice dinner?

15:52.690 --> 15:54.562
Oh, okay. I'd like that.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.346
But don't show
your face before then.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.827
Otherwise, the next time
you drink my beer

15:58.914 --> 16:00.960
it'll be through a straw.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.788
Son, the secret of getting

16:03.875 --> 16:06.530
somebody to miss you is getting
gone in the first place.

16:06.617 --> 16:08.489
- I'm going.
- Don't be rough on him.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.056
That's my precious grandson.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.492
Sorry, Rosetta.

16:11.579 --> 16:13.581
Might be that little
blue pill talking.

16:13.668 --> 16:14.669
Out!

16:22.633 --> 16:25.201
Hey, man. Something smells good.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.116
Braised chicken and baby carrots

16:27.203 --> 16:28.683
drizzled with balsamic vinegar

16:28.770 --> 16:30.380
and a dash of tarragon.

16:30.467 --> 16:32.513
Mmm, sounds delicious.
But listen, Samuel.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.603
I want you to know you don't
have to cook for me like this.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.475
- Carl, this isn't for you.
- Oh.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.216
Good, 'cause I did have
my heart set

16:40.303 --> 16:41.522
on those pork chops
we were talking about

16:41.609 --> 16:43.350
which I assume
are still in the oven.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.961
Is dinner almost ready?

16:46.048 --> 16:48.790
- Who's this?
- My roommate Carl.

16:48.877 --> 16:49.965
He was just leaving.

16:50.052 --> 16:51.662
- I was?
- You were.

16:53.229 --> 16:54.926
Funny thing.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.494
It turns out, chicks dig a man
whose bed does not include

16:57.581 --> 17:00.019
two cab-driving cousins and
an uncle with a prostate issue.

17:02.064 --> 17:04.545
Wait, you're not gonna make me
a sandwich or anything?

17:07.069 --> 17:10.290
Damn. That's what you get
for helping a brother out.

17:10.377 --> 17:12.248
It's Tippy all over again.

17:15.338 --> 17:17.384
You'll probably need this
more than I will tonight.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.739
[hammering]

17:24.826 --> 17:27.220
Moved in two days ago,
already brought home some woman.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.613
See, I was supposed to be
the one to christen that place.

17:31.180 --> 17:32.399
Yeah, that's a bummer.

17:32.486 --> 17:35.010
Make sure you pound
that straight.

17:35.097 --> 17:37.795
Make me feel like a second-class
citizen in my own house.

17:37.882 --> 17:40.015
Man!

17:40.102 --> 17:41.321
That's no way to treat someone.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.105
And maybe tack up
that corner piece

17:43.192 --> 17:45.716
make sure they're flush.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.109
I'm telling you, man,
my blood is boiling!

17:47.196 --> 17:48.502
You know what's good for that?

17:48.589 --> 17:50.069
Hammering.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.689
Oh, my God!

18:01.776 --> 18:03.604
This is beautiful!

18:03.691 --> 18:05.954
I told you I could do it.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.695
Cop and construction worker.

18:07.782 --> 18:09.958
You're like two of
the Village People in one body.

18:10.045 --> 18:11.351
[chuckles]

18:11.438 --> 18:12.700
Not the first time
I've heard that

18:12.787 --> 18:15.181
but never as a compliment.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.139
I'm so proud of you.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.967
What do you say we head upstairs

18:19.054 --> 18:20.664
and start working on
your next project?

18:20.751 --> 18:23.102
Ooh, let me grab
my, uh, safety goggles.

18:23.189 --> 18:24.320
You're gonna need them.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.106
- Hello, young lovers.
- Ay.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.977
Hey, if you're looking
for another project

18:29.064 --> 18:30.718
a ceiling fan in the crapper

18:30.805 --> 18:32.981
should be on the top
of your to-do list.

18:33.068 --> 18:34.548
'The air doesn't circulate'

18:34.635 --> 18:37.377
it just hangs there
like a grim evil.

18:40.249 --> 18:41.729
You're gonna put a lock
on that door, right?

18:41.816 --> 18:43.948
Yeah, Samuel's seeing
that girl again this Friday

18:44.035 --> 18:46.125
so I'll get Carl right on that.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.257
That's my handyman.

18:51.391 --> 18:52.566
How long do you think
it's gonna take

18:52.653 --> 18:55.351
that eyebrow to grow back in?

18:55.438 --> 18:56.744
I don't know.

18:56.831 --> 18:58.746
Maybe I should just
yank that one off.
