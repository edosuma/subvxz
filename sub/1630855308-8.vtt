23:23.560 --> 23:24.860
Hey!

23:24.960 --> 23:26.500
Hey, Kate, come on now.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.700
I need some help.
Please help me now.

23:28.800 --> 23:30.860
OK, when does she
get back from work?

23:30.960 --> 23:33.300
When does she get back
from fucking work?!

23:33.400 --> 23:36.060
Hey! Let me in the fucking room!

23:36.160 --> 23:39.580
(SOBBING) No! Go away!

23:39.680 --> 23:40.740
-(HEAVY THUD)
-You fucking...

23:40.840 --> 23:42.420
(SCREAMS) Stop it!

23:42.520 --> 23:44.340
Tell Kate
we're two minutes away.

23:44.440 --> 23:46.140
-(PHONE CHIMES)
-What the fuck?

23:46.240 --> 23:48.880
-Tully's reading the group chat.
-What?

23:50.240 --> 23:52.260
-Isn't he dead?
-MAYA: Yeah, obviously.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.060
LUCINDA: What happened
to the music?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.660
-(MUSIC RESUMES PLAYING)
-What happened?

23:55.760 --> 23:58.740
Why don't...why don't the three
of us have, like, a group chat?

23:58.840 --> 24:00.700
I don't have a group chat
with anyone.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.860
-(LAUGHS) Can you...
-It'd be just, like...

24:02.960 --> 24:05.580
We could give it a name. You can
call it whatever you want.

24:05.680 --> 24:07.060
-A name?
-LUCINDA: 'L-O-L'.

24:07.160 --> 24:11.340
No, no, no!
'Single Steve Slutty...'

24:11.440 --> 24:13.260
I think that's my cue
to go home.

24:13.360 --> 24:14.980
-BOTH: No! No!
-Yes, I'm going back!

24:15.080 --> 24:16.580
ALAN: No, no, no. Stay.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.180
LUCINDA: No,
there's still a drink.

24:18.280 --> 24:20.500
-Just stay for a little while.
-And...and...and...

24:20.600 --> 24:23.020
-I'll do a little dance.
-Alan's still got a sexy dance.

24:23.120 --> 24:24.700
You gotta see it!

24:24.800 --> 24:26.500
-(LAUGHS)
-LUCINDA: Ride, cowboy!

24:26.600 --> 24:28.460
-(PHONE CHIMES)
-Why does Kate always do this?

24:28.560 --> 24:30.060
She never wants
to do drugs with us,

24:30.160 --> 24:32.180
then when she does, she just
messages the group chat.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.320
Do you think she's OK?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.700
She kind of just
stopped messaging.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.860
GEORGE: Well, I don't know,

24:39.960 --> 24:41.420
but it's annoying.

24:41.520 --> 24:43.260
MAYA: She's not responding
to the chat anymore.

24:43.360 --> 24:45.340
-GUS: Wait. What do you mean?
-MAYA: I don't know.

24:45.440 --> 24:47.220
She's just not replying.
Mo, hurry up!

24:47.320 --> 24:48.700
MO: Don't fuckin' rush me!

24:48.800 --> 24:50.180

-GUS: Finally!

24:56.920 --> 24:59.180
-Maya, stay here.
-Um, wait.

24:59.280 --> 25:01.060
If you get in trouble
for taking the car,

25:01.160 --> 25:02.580
you better not snitch me in.

25:02.680 --> 25:05.260
If I get caught, I absolutely
will be snitching you in.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.900
Stay here.

25:07.000 --> 25:09.540

Fuck!

26:12.360 --> 26:14.360
What do we do now?

26:15.400 --> 26:16.780
GUS: There's a rehab place

26:16.880 --> 26:18.880
he always goes to
