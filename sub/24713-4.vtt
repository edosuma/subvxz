<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "NYPD BLUE"...</i>

00:02.544 --> 00:05.463
YOU'VE ALL MET JOHN CLARK.
HE'S BEEN ASSIGNED TO OUR SQUAD.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.716

FEEL AT HOME.

00:07.716 --> 00:08.717
WELCOME ABOARD.

00:08.717 --> 00:09.801

00:09.801 --> 00:11.845

00:11.845 --> 00:13.471

00:13.471 --> 00:14.639
SORRY ABOUT MISSING
THE FUNERAL.

00:14.639 --> 00:15.765

THEY BURIED HIM.

00:17.225 --> 00:18.226
Eddie: YOU CLARK?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.478

00:20.478 --> 00:21.646

00:25.942 --> 00:27.819
YEAH, I FIGURE
WORK WITH YOUR KID,

00:27.819 --> 00:29.320
MAYBE YOU AND ME
GET TO HANG OUT.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.363
WHAT'D YOU GET?

00:30.363 --> 00:32.198
IT'S A POSSIBLE BREAK-IN,

00:32.198 --> 00:33.867
BUT THE HUSBAND'S ALIBI
DOESN'T CHECK.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.201

GILMORE AT T.A.R.U. SAYS
DETECTIVE CLARK

00:43.168 --> 00:46.296
CALLED TELEPHONE SECURITY

00:46.296 --> 00:48.465
I NEVER CALLED ANYONE!

00:48.465 --> 00:50.759
OH, MAN.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.135
BOSS, THIS IS ON ME.

00:52.135 --> 00:54.679
MY DAD ASKED ME ABOUT THE CASE,
AND I TOLD HIM.

00:54.679 --> 00:57.348
BUT NOT IN A MILLION YEARS
DID I THINK HE WOULD --

00:57.348 --> 00:58.850
IT WAS ME WHO SCREWED UP.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.935
I WON'T HAVE THIS
IN MY SQUAD.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.604
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
YOU'RE NOT A DRUNK.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.980
I WON'T LET HIM
TURN YOU INTO ONE.

01:03.980 --> 01:05.023
GET OUT OF HERE, CLARK.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.649
SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

01:06.649 --> 01:09.152
IF YOUR KID WANTS TO FOLLOW,
HE WILL, BUT YOU LEAVE NOW.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.445
SHUT UP,
YOU MISERABLE DRUNK.

01:10.445 --> 01:11.571

01:11.571 --> 01:12.864
GET AWAY FROM ME, JOHN.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.367
DAD, JUST GO.
WE'LL TALK AT HOME.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.222
JOHNNY ON THE SPOT.

01:37.222 --> 01:39.933
YEAH, I WAS UP ANYWAY.
GOT SOME COFFEES OVER THERE.

01:39.933 --> 01:44.312
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH --
YOU GOT MY VOTE.

01:44.312 --> 01:45.355
SHE A PROS?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.481
IT LOOKS LIKE IT.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.525
HISPANIC, THREE SHOTS TO
THE HEAD, SMALL CALIBER.

01:48.525 --> 01:49.943
ANY I.D.?

01:49.943 --> 01:51.653
JUST A NECKLACE
AND A LEATHER JACKET.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.613
CRIME SCENE SHOULD
BE HERE IN AN HOUR.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.490
HASN'T BEEN HERE
TOO LONG.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.033
NO MORE THAN A DAY.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.786
NOTHING TO CANVASS, I GUESS.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.830
STILL, YOU AND BALDWIN
TAKE A WALK AROUND.

02:01.830 --> 02:04.165
SEE IF THERE'S A PARK BUILDING
OR CONSTRUCTION WORKERS.

02:04.165 --> 02:07.001
ALL RIGHT.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.003
SHE'S GOT A UNICORN TATTOO
ON HER BACK,

02:09.003 --> 02:11.172
SO I'VE GOT VICE RUNNING IT
THROUGH THEIR DATABASE.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.299
THIS SITUATION
WITH YOUR OLD MAN --

02:13.299 --> 02:14.717
I GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.970
SO HE'S NOT GONNA BE COMING
AROUND THE SQUAD ANYMORE,

02:16.970 --> 02:18.763
LET ALONE INTERFERING
WITH CASES.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.682
HEY, I WORKED
WITH YOUR OLD MAN, HUH?

02:20.682 --> 02:22.851
HE'S NOT THE TYPE
TO WALK AWAY FROM THINGS.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.812
HE'S WALKING AWAY FROM THIS
'CAUSE WE HASHED IT OUT,

02:25.812 --> 02:28.481
AND YESTERDAY --
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.566
COME HERE.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.828
INSTEAD OF EVERYBODY
GETTING ALL AGGRAVATED,

02:41.828 --> 02:44.706
WHY DON'T YOU GO WORK
WITH YOUR DAD UP IN THE BRONX?

02:44.706 --> 02:46.374
THEY GOT CRIMES
UP THERE, TOO.

02:46.374 --> 02:50.253
'CAUSE<i> THIS </i>IS WHERE I WANT
TO WORK, AND I'M READY.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.548
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO PARTNER UP
WITH ME BECAUSE OF MY DAD

02:53.548 --> 02:55.049
OR SOME OTHER REASON

02:55.049 --> 02:58.094
THAT DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT KIND OF COP I AM,

02:58.094 --> 02:59.762
THEN JUST MAKE THE CALL,
ALL RIGHT?

02:59.762 --> 03:00.930

IN ANY COMMAND I WORKED FOR.

03:04.017 --> 03:07.353
ASK THEM HOW I DO MY JOB.
LOOK AT MY ARREST RECORD.

03:07.353 --> 03:10.315
I BUILT UP SOLID INFORMANTS
IN THIS PRECINCT.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.608
AND I NEVER BEEN

03:11.608 --> 03:13.526
IN FRONT OF THE CIVILIAN
COMPLAINT REVIEW BOARD.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.570
YOU NEVER PUT YOUR
HANDS ON A GUY?

03:15.570 --> 03:18.406
NO, NOBODY WHO DIDN'T
KNOW THEY DESERVED IT.

03:18.406 --> 03:23.286
I'LL HAVE YOUR BACK
ON THE STREETS, YOU KNOW THAT.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.996
I DON'T COME
DRAGGING INTO WORK.

03:24.996 --> 03:27.749
IF YOU DON'T TYPE GOOD,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THE FIVES.

03:27.749 --> 03:31.044
I SHOW UP EVERY DAY,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.671

05:09.559 --> 05:11.269
PRIMED AND READY
TO GET BACK ON THE CHART.

05:11.269 --> 05:14.439

05:14.439 --> 05:16.482

YOU'RE ASSIGNED
TO MY SQUAD NOW.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.825

05:25.825 --> 05:28.453

EXPERIENCE ALONG WITH ME.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.748
I LOOK FORWARD
TO WORKING WITH YOU.
I'VE HEARD NOTHING BUT...

05:31.748 --> 05:33.708
HAVEN'T HEARD ONE
BAD THING ABOUT YOU.

05:33.708 --> 05:37.587
IF I DON'T KNOW THIS JOB
BY NOW, AFTER 28 YEARS,

05:37.587 --> 05:38.546
I'LL NEVER KNOW IT,
AM I RIGHT?

05:38.546 --> 05:39.756
I HEAR YOU.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.090
SO, WHY THE CHANGE?

05:41.090 --> 05:42.925
YOU WERE ON NIGHT WATCH
THE LAST 10 YEARS, RIGHT?

05:42.925 --> 05:45.386
ACTUALLY, 12,
AND I ENJOYED MY TIME THERE

05:45.386 --> 05:47.347
'CAUSE IT GAVE ME MORE TIME
WITH MY FAMILY,

05:47.347 --> 05:51.351
AND NEW YORK CITY AT NIGHT --
NO NEED FOR EXPLANATION THERE.
SURE, SURE.

05:51.351 --> 05:53.394
BUT I'M THIRD GRADE STILL,

05:53.394 --> 05:56.439

DON'T GET A GRADE BUMP
WORKING NIGHT WATCH.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.691
SO, I PUT IN THE WORK

05:58.691 --> 06:00.818
WHY SHOULDN'T I REAP
MAXIMUM BENEFITS?

06:00.818 --> 06:02.779
I GOTTA BUILD UP
MY PENSION, RIGHT?

06:02.779 --> 06:06.282
WELL, THAT'S AS GOOD
A REASON AS ANY, I GUESS.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.785
WELL, WE GOT A DOA.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.578

LIKE A DEAD PROS.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.428
APPARENTLY NOT.

06:27.428 --> 06:28.429
WHERE ARE THEY?

06:28.429 --> 06:29.764
ON THEIR WAY BACK.

06:29.764 --> 06:33.351
HAVE THEM RESPOND TO RIKERS
AND INTERVIEW HER CO-WORKERS.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.685

I GOTTA NOTIFY THE BOROUGH.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.532
EDDIE.
LIEUTENANT.

06:47.532 --> 06:50.118
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME WITH YOU,
I SPENT FIVE YEARS IN HIGHWAY,

06:50.118 --> 06:52.078
SO I KNOW MY WAY
AROUND A STEERING WHEEL.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.497
YOU CAN DRIVE IF YOU WANT.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.873
HERE WE GO.

07:07.510 --> 07:08.886
HERE'S HIS FILE --

07:08.886 --> 07:11.556
DARIO JENKINS.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.558
WHAT WAS HIS BEEF
WITH LINDA?

07:13.558 --> 07:15.810
LINDA FOUND A JOINT
IN HIS BUNK.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.563
BUT APPARENTLY DARIO FELT SHE
DISSED HIM IN FRONT OF HIS CREW.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.815
I DON'T KNOW, I NEVER GOT
THE WHOLE STORY,

07:20.815 --> 07:23.818
BUT IT ESCALATED, HE ASSAULTED
HER, SAID HE WAS GONNA KILL HER.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.528
THAT GOT HIM
AN EXTRA SIX MONTHS.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.363
RIGHT AWAY
I TOOK HER OFF THE TIERS

07:27.363 --> 07:28.865
AND PUT HER IN ADMINISTRATION.

07:28.865 --> 07:31.492
AND HE WAS RELEASED
A MONTH AGO?
YEAH.

07:31.492 --> 07:34.162
HE'S THE ONLY PRISONER I CAN
THINK OF WHO'D DO SOMETHING.

07:34.162 --> 07:37.206
I SENT HER HOME WITH A POLICE
RADIO SINCE HE GOT OUT.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.833
HOW WAS LINDA OTHERWISE?

07:38.833 --> 07:42.003
SHE WAS A COMPETENT OFFICER.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.546
HOW ABOUT PERSONALLY?

07:43.546 --> 07:47.300
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH I CAN
REALLY GIVE YOU ON THAT.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.926
WELL, GIVE IT A SHOT.

07:48.926 --> 07:52.346
LINDA WAS A LITTLE...ODD.

07:52.346 --> 07:55.600
A LITTLE ODD? WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THAT?

07:55.600 --> 07:57.602
THERE WAS NO BEHAVIOR THAT
WARRANTED MY INTERVENTION

07:57.602 --> 08:00.062
OR ANYTHING THAT
INTERFERED WITH HER JOB.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.647
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
HER MURDER.

08:01.647 --> 08:02.815
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

08:02.815 --> 08:05.026
SO DON'T FILTER INFORMATION
THROUGH YOUR JOB.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.486
LET'S CONCENTRATE
ON<i> OURS </i>RIGHT NOW.

08:06.486 --> 08:09.197

HAVE TO DO WITH WHO KILLED HER

08:09.197 --> 08:10.239
IS DARIO JENKINS.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.283

RESPONSIBILITY TO MY DEPARTMENT.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.376
I HOPE YOU GUYS ARE GONNA DO
THE RIGHT THING AND TREAT THIS

08:22.376 --> 08:25.046

WELL, AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

08:27.048 --> 08:29.467

EVERY CASE WE CATCH.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.594
FROM WHAT SHE SAID, YEAH --

WERE YOU WITH YOUR GRANDMA
THIS MORNING?

29:09.998 --> 29:11.082
SHE TAKE YOU TO SCHOOL?

29:11.082 --> 29:13.752
WE WENT TO MY MOM'S HOUSE
FIRST, BUT SHE WASN'T HOME.

29:16.463 --> 29:19.215
SO... YOU AND YOUR
GRANDMA WENT

29:19.215 --> 29:22.051
TO YOUR MOM'S HOUSE
FIRST AND THEN TO SCHOOL?

29:23.595 --> 29:26.890
DID YOU GO WITH YOUR GRANDMA
TO SEE IF YOUR MOM WAS HOME,

29:26.890 --> 29:29.350
OR DID YOU STAY IN THE CAR?

29:29.350 --> 29:32.020
I STAYED IN THE CAR.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.606
SHE'S IN HEAVEN NOW.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.357
I KNOW SHE IS.

29:36.357 --> 29:37.609
I KNOW.

29:37.609 --> 29:39.819
SHE'S NOT SICK ANYMORE,
SHE'S HAPPY,

29:39.819 --> 29:41.946
AND SHE'S LOOKING DOWN
ON YOU RIGHT NOW.

29:45.825 --> 29:48.953
JOHN'S GONNA STAY IN HERE
WITH YOU NOW, OKAY?

29:48.953 --> 29:50.288
OKAY.

30:01.925 --> 30:05.136
IS JANIE ALL RIGHT?

30:05.136 --> 30:06.429
SHE'S FINE.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.849
THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW,
MRS. FOLANDER...

30:11.518 --> 30:13.686
YOU WENT TO YOUR DAUGHTER'S
HOUSE THIS MORNING,

30:13.686 --> 30:14.979
AND SOMETHING WENT WRONG.

30:14.979 --> 30:17.273
YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT TO,
WHICH IS IMPORTANT,

30:17.273 --> 30:18.900
BECAUSE THEN IT
WASN'T PREMEDITATED.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.276
WHAT IS THIS?

30:20.276 --> 30:22.070
YOU NEED TO TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED,

30:22.070 --> 30:24.864
BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T
AND FORCE THIS TO TRIAL,

30:24.864 --> 30:26.491
THEY'RE GONNA PUT JANIE
ON THE STAND

30:26.491 --> 30:28.159
AND MAKE HER TESTIFY
TO EVERYTHING,

30:28.159 --> 30:30.662
INCLUDING HOW SHE WAITED IN
THE CAR WHILE YOU WENT UP --

30:30.662 --> 30:31.746
YOU TALKED TO HER?

30:31.746 --> 30:33.540
DON'T PUT YOUR
GRANDDAUGHTER THROUGH THIS.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.835
DON'T TRAUMATIZE HER MORE
THAN SHE ALREADY HAS BEEN.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.378
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

30:38.378 --> 30:41.089
WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE
CAN TO HELP YOU

30:41.089 --> 30:42.465
AND PROTECT JANIE.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.678
YOU DON'T KNOW THE HELL
THAT I WENT THROUGH

30:46.678 --> 30:47.679
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

30:47.679 --> 30:50.348
YOU'RE RIGHT. WE DON'T.

30:50.348 --> 30:51.641
SO TELL US.

30:53.393 --> 30:57.814
SHE WASN'T FIT TO LIVE,
LET ALONE RAISE A CHILD.

30:57.814 --> 30:59.983
SHE TOLD ME SHE
WASN'T FIT TO LIVE --

30:59.983 --> 31:01.442
THAT SHE WANTED TO DIE.

31:01.442 --> 31:02.694
DID SHE WANT TO DIE

31:02.694 --> 31:04.487
WHEN YOU WENT OVER THERE
THIS MORNING?

31:04.487 --> 31:06.614
OR WAS THAT MORE
ABOUT WHAT<i> YOU </i>WANTED?

31:06.614 --> 31:09.242
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT SHE WAS DOING.

31:09.242 --> 31:11.619
JANIE WANTED TO STAY
WITH ME.

31:11.619 --> 31:14.747
SHE'D CRY IN THE CAR EVERY
TIME SHE HAD TO GO BACK.

31:14.747 --> 31:17.292
SANDY GOT THE COURT ORDER
JUST SO SHE WOULDN'T BE ALONE.

31:17.292 --> 31:20.753
I CONVINCED HER YESTERDAY
NOT TO GO THROUGH WITH IT.

31:20.753 --> 31:23.882
THEN SHE CALLED ME
THIS MORNING

31:23.882 --> 31:25.800
AND SAID THAT SHE'D
CHANGED HER MIND.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.510
WHICH YOU WEREN'T UP FOR.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.929
SO I-I WENT OVER THERE,

31:29.929 --> 31:31.264
AND I-I BEGGED HER...

31:31.264 --> 31:34.434
NOT TO RUIN
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE,

31:34.434 --> 31:36.144
OR MOVE IN WITH US.

31:36.144 --> 31:38.563
BUT NO!

31:38.563 --> 31:41.232
AND AS A MOTHER...

31:41.232 --> 31:45.570
TO BOTH OF THEM,
I HAD TO MAKE A CHOICE.

31:45.570 --> 31:47.655
AND SO I DID.

31:47.655 --> 31:51.075
AND THAT'S NOT RUINING
THIS LITTLE GIRL'S LIFE?

31:51.075 --> 31:54.245
DON'T YOU JUDGE ME.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.413
I'M NOT, MA'AM.

31:57.248 --> 31:59.125
THEY GOT SOMEONE
WHO'LL DO THAT LATER.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.013
WHATEVER.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.015
WHATEVER, MAN. WHATEVER.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.308
GET THESE CUFFS OFF ME --

32:15.308 --> 32:16.517
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?

32:19.562 --> 32:20.813
TAKE A SEAT.

32:20.813 --> 32:22.398
SIT DOWN.

32:23.441 --> 32:24.859
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT?

32:24.859 --> 32:26.319
NOTHING HAPPENED, MAN.

32:26.319 --> 32:28.655
HEY, YOU'RE IN HERE
FOR A REASON, GERALD.

32:28.655 --> 32:31.032
WE DIDN'T PICK YOU
RANDOM OFF THE STREET.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.241
HER NAME WAS LINDA VELEZ,

32:32.241 --> 32:33.868
IN CASE NOBODY BOTHERED
WITH INTRODUCTIONS.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.703
WE GOT WITNESSES SAW YOU
AND JERMAINE

32:35.703 --> 32:37.455
TAKE HER INTO GRANDMA'S
APARTMENT.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.583
AND WE GOT WITNESSES SAW YOU
AND LINDA LEAVE IN HER CAR.

32:40.583 --> 32:42.251
WITNESSES LIKE WHAT?
JERMAINE?

32:42.251 --> 32:44.587
YOU GOT BIGGER PROBLEMS
THAN WHO SAW YOU DO IT.

32:44.587 --> 32:47.173
MAN, LISTEN, LOOK, I HAD
A GOOD TIME, ALL RIGHT?

32:47.173 --> 32:50.551
ALL I WANTED WAS A RIDE TO
THE PARTY I WAS ON MY WAY TO

32:50.551 --> 32:52.387
BEFORE SHE SCOOPED ME
AND JERMAINE UP

32:52.387 --> 32:54.847
AND PUT US EVERY WHICH WAY
BUT ON HER HEAD.

32:54.847 --> 32:58.518
WHAT HAPPENED AFTER THAT
IS ALL ON THAT CRAZY, YO.
NOBODY ELSE.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.646
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A NEW YORK CITY
CORRECTIONS OFFICER,

33:01.646 --> 33:03.022
SO WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.148
OKAY, OKAY.

33:04.148 --> 33:05.858
LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT HAPPENED, THEN.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.819
SHE PULLED A GUN ON ME.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.070
YEAH -- A GUN.

33:09.070 --> 33:11.656
SO GUESS WHO WENT
INTO SURVIVAL MODE?

33:11.656 --> 33:12.532
ME.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.617
WHY WOULD SHE PULL A GUN
ON YOU, GERALD?

33:14.617 --> 33:17.078
I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE DRIVING DOWN THE BLOCK,

33:17.078 --> 33:19.789
TALKING ABOUT THIS CLUB,
BALLISTICS, WE'VE BOTH BEEN TO,

33:19.789 --> 33:21.958
WHEN OUT OF THE BLUE,
SHE JUST STARTS FLIPPING,

33:21.958 --> 33:23.751
LIKE, "WHERE'S MY GOLD
NECKLACE?"

33:23.751 --> 33:25.753
HELL IF I KNOW.
I AIN'T TAKE IT.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.047
SO THEN SHE PULLS OVER,
YANKS A GUN OUT ON MY ASS.

33:28.047 --> 33:29.298
PUT IT RIGHT IN MY FACE.

33:29.298 --> 33:32.093
SO I SAID, "THIS NECKLACE
THAT YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT

33:32.093 --> 33:33.636
IS RIGHT AROUND YOUR NECK."

33:33.636 --> 33:37.640
SO THEN SHE FEELS IT,
CALMS DOWN, LOWERS THE GUN,

33:37.640 --> 33:39.308
STARTS TALKING
ABOUT BALLISTICS AGAIN

33:39.308 --> 33:40.893
LIKE NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED.

33:40.893 --> 33:42.186
BITCH WAS CRAZY.

33:42.186 --> 33:43.771
JUST STICK TO WHAT
HAPPENED

33:43.771 --> 33:46.649
AND LEAVE YOUR OPINIONS
OF HER OUT OF IT.

33:46.649 --> 33:49.652
SO I'M LOOKING AT THIS GUN.
IT'S IN HER LAP.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.863
I'VE NEVER SEEN A GUN
LIKE THAT BEFORE --

33:51.863 --> 33:54.365
NO HAMMER ON IT.
IT'S AN ILL GUN.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.784
SO I TOLD HER I'D GIVE HER
100 FOR IT.

33:56.784 --> 33:59.120
SHE SAID NAH, SHE NEEDED IT
FOR THE JOB,

33:59.120 --> 34:01.581
WHICH I AIN'T KNOW MEANT
"CORRECTIONS OFFICER."

34:01.581 --> 34:04.250
SO I TOLD HER,
"PRETEND LIKE YOU LOST IT."

34:04.250 --> 34:05.626
SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T DO IT.

34:05.626 --> 34:08.254
SHE'D GET A 10-DAY RIP FOR IT,
WHATEVER THE HELL THAT MEANT.

34:08.254 --> 34:10.381
SHE PUT IT BACK
IN HER POCKET.

34:10.381 --> 34:12.759
SHE STARTS STARING
OUT THE WINDOW,

34:12.759 --> 34:14.218
ALL SPACED-OUT LIKE.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.887
THAT'S WHEN
I PULLED OUT MY GUN,

34:15.887 --> 34:18.097
SHOT HER THREE TIMES
IN THE HEAD.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.432
SO YOU COULD TAKE HER GUN?

34:19.432 --> 34:21.893
I ENDED UP
TAKING THE GUN, YEAH.

34:21.893 --> 34:24.103
WHERE IS IT?
AT MY APARTMENT.

34:24.103 --> 34:25.563
WHERE'S YOURS?

34:25.563 --> 34:28.149
IT'S WITH IT. LOOK, I DIDN'T
KNOW THAT SHE WAS AN OFFICER.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.026
IT'S ALL RIGHT TO KILL HER
IF SHE WASN'T?

34:30.026 --> 34:31.360
SHE PULLED A GUN OUT ON ME!

34:31.360 --> 34:34.238
WAS SHE POINTING A GUN
AT YOU WHEN YOU SHOT HER?

34:34.238 --> 34:35.907
COME ON, IT'S REAL SIMPLE.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.700
IN MY BOOK,
YOU DON'T PULL A GUN

34:37.700 --> 34:38.910
ON SOMEBODY YOU'RE
NOT PREPARED TO SHOOT.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.330
WAS SHE POINTING THE GUN
AT YOU WHEN YOU SHOT HER?!

34:42.330 --> 34:44.665
NO, BUT SHE HAD IT
IN MY FACE UP UNTIL THEN!

34:44.665 --> 34:45.917
AND LIKE I SAID,

34:45.917 --> 34:47.919
YOU PULL OUT A GUN,
THAT'S SAYING SOMETHING TO ME.

34:47.919 --> 34:49.337
AND IT DON'T SAY NOTHING

34:49.337 --> 34:51.172
THAT THEY PUT IT BACK
IN THEIR POCKET?!

34:51.172 --> 34:53.800
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
UP IN HARLEM WORLD, MAN.

34:53.800 --> 34:56.677
YOU PULL A GUN ON SOMEBODY,
THERE'S CONSEQUENCES.

34:56.677 --> 34:57.929
THAT'S HOW IT GOES.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.138
YEAH?

34:59.138 --> 35:02.558
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA LEARN
ABOUT SOME CONSEQUENCES.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.742
I DON'T KNOW.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.913
COME ON.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.216
WHAT IS IT YOU DON'T KNOW?

35:35.216 --> 35:38.469
HOW MUCH SHE'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR GETTING HERSELF KILLED.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.596
YOU FEEL HE SHOT HER
IN SELF-DEFENSE?

35:40.596 --> 35:41.472
NO.

35:41.472 --> 35:42.598
DID HE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE

35:42.598 --> 35:44.642
WHEN SHE PUT THE GUN
BACK IN HER POCKET?

35:44.642 --> 35:46.435
SOMEONE COULD ARGUE THAT
HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT

35:46.435 --> 35:48.062
SHE WAS GONNA
PULL HER GUN OUT AGAIN.

35:48.062 --> 35:50.189
WE JUST INTERVIEWED HIM.
HE DIDN'T SAY THAT.

35:50.189 --> 35:52.400
THINGS PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN SAYING ABOUT HER --

35:52.400 --> 35:54.902
THE DEFENSE ATTORNEY'S
GONNA CLAIM SHE WAS CRAZY.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.237
WHAT ARE WE GONNA SAY?

35:56.237 --> 35:58.573
THAT'S ASSUMING WE PUT
ALL THAT IN THE FIVES.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.996
LISTEN, THIS IS YOUR CASE.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.789
WHEN YOU TYPE IT UP,
IT'LL SAY,

36:06.789 --> 36:09.208
"IN THE COMPANY OF
DETECTIVE ANDY SIPOWICZ."

36:09.208 --> 36:12.211
<i>YOU </i>GET CALLED TO TESTIFY
WHEN IT GOES TO TRIAL,

36:12.211 --> 36:14.797
SO YOU GOTTA MAKE
THE DECISION THAT SITS RIGHT.

36:14.797 --> 36:16.966
BUT I AM TELLING YOU
RIGHT NOW,

36:16.966 --> 36:18.718
IF YOU PUT IN
ALL THESE OPINIONS

36:18.718 --> 36:20.720
ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THOUGHT
MAYBE SHE WAS HALF WACKY,

36:20.720 --> 36:22.138
THIS GUY WALKS.

36:22.138 --> 36:25.266
I DON'T CARE IF SHE STOOD
AROUND WITH A CANDLE IN HER HAND

36:25.266 --> 36:26.726
CALLING HERSELF
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

36:26.726 --> 36:28.144
SHE PUT HER GUN AWAY.

36:28.144 --> 36:31.230
HER ANIMOSITY WAS GONE,
AND HE WAS OUT OF DANGER.

36:31.230 --> 36:35.276
BUT HE WENT AHEAD
AND HE SHOT HER FOR HER GUN,

36:35.276 --> 36:36.861
WHICH HE TOOK.

36:39.155 --> 36:40.907
SO YOU GOTTA DECIDE.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.452
I NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT.

36:54.670 --> 36:56.005
DID HE GO?

36:56.005 --> 36:57.924
YEAH.
YEAH, HE, UH --

36:57.924 --> 36:59.926
HE KILLED HER
FOR HER SERVICE REVOLVER.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.844
HE WANTED TO BUY IT.
SHE DECLINED.

37:01.844 --> 37:03.846
SHE SHOWED IT TO HIM,
OR HE FOUND IT?

37:03.846 --> 37:07.058
IT'S JUNIOR'S CASE.
LET HIM RUN THE SPECIFICS.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.936
YOU TAKING THE MOTHER
TO CENTRAL BOOKING?

37:09.936 --> 37:12.939
UH, GIBSON'S STILL
PROCESSING HER DOWNSTAIRS.

37:12.939 --> 37:14.523
WE, UH...FLIPPED FOR IT.

37:14.523 --> 37:16.776
WHAT'S HE DOING
OUT OF NIGHT WATCH?

37:16.776 --> 37:19.362
HE'S ON DAY TOUR NOW,
LIKE HE'S GOT A RIGHT TO DO.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.405
AND HE DIDN'T GET
BOUNCED OUT OF THERE?

37:21.405 --> 37:23.449
NOPE. AND I ASKED AROUND.

37:23.449 --> 37:25.243
GREAT. WE GOT ONE GUY
IN DIAPERS,

37:25.243 --> 37:26.535
THE OTHER ONE IN DEPENDS.

37:26.535 --> 37:28.579
IF YOU LIKE,
I'LL TAKE CLARK,

37:28.579 --> 37:30.581
AND YOU CAN PARTNER
WITH EDDIE.

37:30.581 --> 37:32.875
IF I HAVE TO PARTNER WITH THAT
STIFF, I'LL KILL MYSELF.

37:32.875 --> 37:35.920
YOU OKAY WITH GIBSON FOR NOW?
IT'S NOT LIKE WE GOT A CHOICE.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.380
SURE.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.173
BUT YOU OWE ME.

37:39.173 --> 37:42.301
LEAST YOU WON'T
HAVE TO PAY FOR A MEAL.

37:42.301 --> 37:43.511
[ CHUCKLES ]

37:43.511 --> 37:44.679
WHERE'S THE GRANDKID?

37:44.679 --> 37:46.806
JOHN IRVIN'S WITH HER
UP IN THE CRIB.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.475
BOSS...I'LL BE BACK IN
A LITTLE BIT IF THAT'S OKAY.

37:49.475 --> 37:51.852
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO
WITH THE GIRL?

37:51.852 --> 37:53.187
Connie: WE RAN THE DAD.

37:53.187 --> 37:55.940
NO RECORD OTHER
THAN THE TWO DOMESTICS.

37:55.940 --> 37:57.400
HE GOT A JOB.

37:57.400 --> 38:00.069
HE'S GOT GENUINE CONCERN
FOR HIS DAUGHTER.

38:00.069 --> 38:03.406
COURT RECORDS SHOW HE TRIED
REPEATEDLY TO GET HER BACK.

38:03.406 --> 38:04.907
YOUR CALL.

38:04.907 --> 38:07.576
I THINK WE SHOULD
PUT THEM BACK TOGETHER.

38:07.576 --> 38:08.911
DO IT.

38:08.911 --> 38:10.538
AND LET THE BUREAU
OF CHILD SERVICES KNOW.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.790
WHERE'S CLARK GOING?

38:12.790 --> 38:16.127
HOPEFULLY NOT TO RUN
THIS CASE BY HIS OLD MAN.

38:22.842 --> 38:26.262
THANKS FOR MEETING ME.

38:26.262 --> 38:27.972
IS THERE A BREAK
IN THE CASE?

38:27.972 --> 38:30.182
UH, WE'VE GOT SOMEBODY
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.268
AND IT'S NOT THE GUY
THAT SHE WAS SEEING.

38:32.268 --> 38:33.936
HE HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH IT.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.858
I WANTED TO TALK SOME MORE
ABOUT LINDA --

38:38.858 --> 38:41.110
HER PERSONALITY.
OKAY.

38:41.110 --> 38:44.196
UH, THINGS THAT PEOPLE WHO
KNEW HER HAVE SAID, UH --

38:44.196 --> 38:45.865
WELL, IT'S PAINTED A PICTURE

38:45.865 --> 38:48.409
OF SOMEONE WHO
WAS MAYBE A LITTLE...OFF.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.911
THAT'S GOT SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HOW SHE DIED?

38:50.911 --> 38:53.080
WELL, WE GOT A "HE SAID,
SHE SAID" THING GOING ON.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.290
OKAY.

38:54.290 --> 38:56.834
DID LINDA...EVER BLOW UP,

38:56.834 --> 38:58.586

FOR NO REASON?

38:58.586 --> 39:00.338

WITH PEOPLE SOMETIMES,

39:00.338 --> 39:02.131
BUT NOTHING
OUT OF THE ORDINARY.

39:02.131 --> 39:04.383
WERE YOU EVER AFRAID OF HER?
NO.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.719
ANYBODY YOU KNOW
EVER AFRAID OF HER?
NO.

39:06.719 --> 39:07.928

39:07.928 --> 39:09.847
NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

39:09.847 --> 39:13.309
DID SHE EVER SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT BEING OVERWHELMED?

39:13.309 --> 39:15.603
YOU MEAN LIKE --
LIKE SUICIDAL?

39:15.603 --> 39:16.854
YEAH.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.147
NO.

39:18.147 --> 39:21.275

REALLY DARK MOODS SOMETIMES.

39:21.275 --> 39:24.153
DID SHE EVER SEEK ANY HELP,
TALK TO SOMEONE?

39:24.153 --> 39:26.655
THAT WAS THE THING PEOPLE
WOULD SAY ABOUT HER --

39:26.655 --> 39:28.616
THAT MAYBE SHE
SHOULD GET SOME HELP.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.785
BUT NO ONE EVER
SUGGESTED IT TO HER?

39:30.785 --> 39:33.996
THAT'S A BIG THING,
TELLING SOMEONE THAT.

39:33.996 --> 39:37.041

WHO HELD A JOB,

MAYBE IT WAS A ROBBERY.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.103
I'M SORRY.

40:06.153 --> 40:07.905
SHE PULLED HER GUN ON HIM?

40:07.905 --> 40:10.616
YEAH. SHE THOUGHT HE STOLE
HER NECKLACE,

40:10.616 --> 40:13.244
BUT IT GOT RESOLVED
WHEN SHE PUT IT BACK
IN HER COAT.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.413
SO HE WASN'T IN IMMINENT
DANGER WHEN HE SHOT HER?

40:16.914 --> 40:18.541

40:29.176 --> 40:32.221
ANYTHING ELSE I NEED TO KNOW
THAT ISN'T IN THE STATEMENT?

40:32.221 --> 40:33.472
