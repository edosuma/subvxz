01:31.320 --> 01:32.390
Hi.

01:35.920 --> 01:36.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:55.040 --> 01:56.110
Get in.

04:45.240 --> 04:46.879
Hey there, baby!

04:49.040 --> 04:50.360
Come here, baby!

06:14.840 --> 06:15.956
Beautiful.

06:18.840 --> 06:20.240
Mmm.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.990
Thank you.

06:36.760 --> 06:37.750
Hello?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.036
Yes.

06:39.240 --> 06:40.356
How are things?

06:44.520 --> 06:45.590
What time?

06:47.120 --> 06:49.635
Are you going to dress like a slut again?

06:50.000 --> 06:52.196
And whine if you don't find a guy?

06:54.280 --> 06:55.714
Hold on a second.

07:01.160 --> 07:03.516
I'll call you back. I've got work to do.

07:04.040 --> 07:05.918
I'll swing by your place.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.314
See you tonight.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.313
<i>Do you have any more time left?</i>

07:36.960 --> 07:38.740
- Your thighs touch.
- What?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.314
Your thighs rub together.

07:40.760 --> 07:41.955
Stop it!

07:42.880 --> 07:44.997
It's your body shape.

07:45.200 --> 07:49.916
Even if you weighed 30 kg, your thighs
would still touch, like a baby's.

07:51.480 --> 07:52.820
You're silly! Back off!

07:52.880 --> 07:53.950
Why?

07:54.200 --> 07:55.111
Babies are cute!

09:19.800 --> 09:21.100
What's your name?

09:21.160 --> 09:22.116
Rupert.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.840
Nice to meet you.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.431
- And you?
- Electre.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.954
Nice to meet you.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.792
You coming? I'm fed up. Let's go home.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.400
Not just yet.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.556
I can't take any more.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.110
Are you staying?

10:15.520 --> 10:16.840
Seriously?

10:18.040 --> 10:19.110
You'd stay for that?

10:20.520 --> 10:22.876
"That" can drive you home, if you like.

10:24.680 --> 10:25.670
Hey.

10:32.480 --> 10:33.470
Do you like him?

10:33.680 --> 10:34.670
A little.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.519
You're not picky.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.359
You think all guys are lame.

10:48.520 --> 10:50.000
He's got a lousy car.

11:15.920 --> 11:17.718
Well... thank you.

11:18.880 --> 11:20.109
You're welcome.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.709
Have a good night.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.840
What do you do in London?

11:54.280 --> 11:56.590
I work in an agency.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.159
I find flats for French people.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.551
Do you make a good living?

12:03.600 --> 12:04.636
A living.

12:06.680 --> 12:07.716
How about you?

12:08.440 --> 12:09.590
A living.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.518
Do you mind if I put on some music?

12:21.960 --> 12:23.155
No.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.800
Got anything happier?

12:42.720 --> 12:43.870
No.

12:45.440 --> 12:46.874
I have sadder stuff.

12:49.560 --> 12:51.040
Do you enjoy suffering?

13:06.600 --> 13:09.115
Ever wonder what life's like for these girls?

13:09.920 --> 13:10.876
What?

13:12.440 --> 13:14.991
Do you ever wonder
what life is like for these girls?

13:16.560 --> 13:17.550
No.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.029
It's normal.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.559
You're a great estate agent.

13:23.520 --> 13:25.352
With estate agent's problems.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.079
Their lives...

13:33.080 --> 13:35.515
...despair, misery...

13:36.520 --> 13:38.432
...concentrated violence.

13:39.440 --> 13:41.318
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

13:44.680 --> 13:46.399
You caught a lucky break.

13:49.320 --> 13:51.073
You see the girl in the red right there?

13:52.560 --> 13:54.836
Maybe she's a great estate agent potentially.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.110
Shut up!

14:06.640 --> 14:08.199
I'm sorry, I...

14:08.800 --> 14:10.075
Let's just have the music.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.240
Excuse me.

14:18.840 --> 14:21.275
Can you let me out? I'd like to walk a bit.

14:22.160 --> 14:23.435
Anything wrong?

14:23.640 --> 14:24.710
Fine, I...

14:26.240 --> 14:27.594
I need some air.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.634
I feel nauseous.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.114
A walk will do me good.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.438
- <i>And you?</i>
- <i>Charlotte.</i>

15:24.120 --> 15:25.156
<i>Okay.</i>

15:26.040 --> 15:27.713
- <i>Your name?</i>
- <i>Imogen.</i>

15:28.120 --> 15:29.540
- <i>Sorry?</i>
- <i>Imogen.</i>

15:29.600 --> 15:32.900
- <i>Okay. What's your name?</i>
- <i>Chrissy.</i>

15:32.960 --> 15:35.620
<i>Very good. Okay, could you laugh?</i>

15:35.680 --> 15:37.831
<i>Could you show me your teeth?</i>

15:38.720 --> 15:40.154
Okay, your teeth?

15:40.520 --> 15:41.749
<i>Your teeth?</i>

15:42.160 --> 15:43.116
<i>Okay.</i>

15:43.280 --> 15:44.873
<i>Bit more relaxed.</i>

15:45.760 --> 15:48.036
<i>Could you come on and walk?</i>

15:52.520 --> 15:53.954
<i>Okay, come back.</i>

16:29.200 --> 16:30.634
Hello, beautiful!

16:36.560 --> 16:37.630
What's new?

16:38.400 --> 16:39.629
Nothing.

16:42.040 --> 16:42.996
You look tired.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.236
You think so?

16:48.440 --> 16:49.500
Do you sleep well?

16:49.560 --> 16:50.550
Very well.

16:51.480 --> 16:52.470
Do you eat well?

16:55.520 --> 16:56.636
Vegetables?

16:57.280 --> 16:58.396
Lots of vegetables.

16:58.880 --> 16:59.916
That's good.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.314
You're prettier than ever.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.150
Thanks.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.913
I'd like to take off on holiday.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.796
Where?

17:23.119 --> 17:24.156
I don't know.

17:25.599 --> 17:26.920
Not sure who with, either.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.712
- Do you still see Marine?
- No.

17:30.480 --> 17:31.436
Good.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.600
I'm fed up with seeing...

17:34.840 --> 17:36.194
girls of the trade.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.113
Do you want to go with me?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.076
Yes.

17:43.760 --> 17:44.876
Why not?

17:51.400 --> 17:52.834
Do it as a favor.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.072
They're good customers. They know you.

17:56.480 --> 17:57.960
I trust you.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.833
I know. But that's not it.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.918
- I don't do that anymore.
- I know.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.274
But it's a one-time thing.

18:07.840 --> 18:08.990
It's big money.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.154
I'll think it over.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.550
Yes, please do.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.000
Still wild about me, Pussy?

18:35.200 --> 18:36.111
You turn me on.

18:36.480 --> 18:37.516
Shh.

18:42.840 --> 18:44.420
I'll give you the papers Tuesday.

18:44.480 --> 18:45.880
We're meeting then anyway.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.150
Fine.

18:48.200 --> 18:49.714
I'm counting on you, Virginie.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.434
Stop looking at me.

19:01.440 --> 19:02.760
I'll look if I want.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.075
Get some rest.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.234
Bye, Cook, honey!

19:43.280 --> 19:45.033
You hate that I earn so much, eh?

20:31.800 --> 20:33.996
You seem to be in a nasty mood, darling.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.753
Not too nasty, I hope.

20:37.520 --> 20:38.840
Sit down.

20:48.600 --> 20:49.716
Don't touch.

23:27.000 --> 23:28.673
- Hey, ebony lady!
- Yo!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.753
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

23:32.560 --> 23:33.630
Got time for lunch?

23:33.840 --> 23:36.400
My aunt didn't show up this morning.

23:37.440 --> 23:38.635
You should have phoned.

23:38.840 --> 23:39.990
I was in the neighborhood.

23:40.360 --> 23:41.510
Oh, Okay...

23:41.880 --> 23:43.519
I'll take a cigarette break.

23:44.240 --> 23:45.276
I'll be right back.

23:54.680 --> 23:56.399
So, did you fuck the guy?

23:56.560 --> 23:57.596
No...

23:57.760 --> 24:00.150
I wouldn't mind if you had. You can tell me.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.516
Well, I didn't.

24:07.040 --> 24:08.110
What's up?

24:08.360 --> 24:10.192
You got a secret or what?

24:13.560 --> 24:15.870
Have you ever met a guy

24:16.600 --> 24:18.637
and felt totally bewildered?

24:22.200 --> 24:25.910
Like you're about to die?
Like it's the end of your life?

24:28.760 --> 24:29.955
No, forget it.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.070
Hi.

25:20.840 --> 25:21.700
Hello.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.340
- Hello.
- Thirty-Six Upper Street.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.437
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

25:50.760 --> 25:51.989
Hey!

25:55.400 --> 25:56.436
Hey.

25:57.440 --> 25:58.317
Thanks.

25:59.880 --> 26:01.075
Why's he here?

26:01.920 --> 26:03.240
He called. I invited him.

26:06.720 --> 26:07.949
Is he your new boyfriend?

26:08.680 --> 26:09.796
Not at all.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.236
I just invited him.

26:45.120 --> 26:47.237
I'm sorry about the other night.

26:50.200 --> 26:51.395
It's no big deal.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.491
Hold on.

28:04.400 --> 28:05.834
Do you want me to drive you home?

28:14.800 --> 28:16.280
I should never go out.

28:16.440 --> 28:17.715
It's always an ordeal.

28:18.920 --> 28:20.440
You don't have fun?

28:21.200 --> 28:22.395
I don't know how to.

28:22.960 --> 28:24.110
Me, either.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.033
Talking with someone like you
is my idea of fun.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.960
Like me?

28:32.480 --> 28:33.709
What am I like?

28:34.040 --> 28:37.636
Not normal. Barely human.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.513
No sad song?

28:51.840 --> 28:54.196
I'm not going to put on any song at all.

28:57.000 --> 28:58.400
I'm better when I'm alone.

29:00.160 --> 29:01.833
I think I'm toxic for others.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.035
Why do you say that?

29:04.360 --> 29:05.350
No reason.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.836
If you don't know how to have fun,
and you don't chat,

29:10.360 --> 29:11.589
can you sing?

29:11.800 --> 29:12.916
A little.

29:17.680 --> 29:18.909
Go ahead.

29:19.920 --> 29:21.832
- What, here?
- Yes.

29:24.360 --> 29:25.430
Okay.

29:29.800 --> 29:32.872
<i>Hey you, tell me you love me.</i>

29:33.200 --> 29:35.078
<i>Even if it's a lie</i>

29:35.440 --> 29:37.477
<i>Even if we don't stand a chance</i>

29:37.920 --> 29:39.832
<i>Life is so sad</i>

29:40.320 --> 29:42.152
<i>Tell me you love me.</i>

29:42.680 --> 29:44.751
<i>Every day is the same</i>

29:44.960 --> 29:47.191
<i>I need some romance.</i>

32:03.080 --> 32:04.596
Come in.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.393
I didn't lie, she's lovely.

32:13.320 --> 32:14.390
What do you think?

32:14.680 --> 32:15.909
She's beautiful.

32:17.760 --> 32:18.830
Sit.

32:27.960 --> 32:29.679
Sofia, this is Virginie.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.840
She's the one you're going
away with for the weekend.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.953
She will make sure everything
goes well for your first big trip.

32:40.720 --> 32:43.838
Virginie and I have known each other
for a long, long time.

32:44.440 --> 32:45.920
I have complete trust in her.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.070
You understand?

32:51.760 --> 32:53.956
You must do everything she tells you.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.993
It's very important.

32:56.480 --> 32:59.518
Like me, trust her. Blind trust.

33:00.680 --> 33:02.558
Okay? You are very lucky.

33:02.840 --> 33:05.116
She is a nice girl. The nicest.

33:05.480 --> 33:06.880
The sweetest.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.511
Okay, thank you. You can go back.

33:18.920 --> 33:20.752
There! It's done.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.670
I'm relieved.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.116
Damn!

33:26.400 --> 33:27.834
- This will do, right?
- Yes.

33:29.880 --> 33:31.872
- What do you think?
- She's pretty.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.475
But not very bright.

33:40.120 --> 33:41.236
Excuse me?

33:41.680 --> 33:43.860
- You know my sister?
- Sorry?

33:43.920 --> 33:47.100
- Do you know my sister?
- Yes, a little.

33:47.160 --> 33:49.516
I've been waiting for her. I'm her sister.

33:52.480 --> 33:55.031
We're in the pub right at the corner,
if you want to come.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.158
- Pub?
- Yeah, come on.

33:57.800 --> 33:58.836
Okay.

34:20.159 --> 34:21.958
So how many of you are in your family?

34:24.360 --> 34:26.500
Seven. I'm the youngest.

34:26.560 --> 34:29.500
And before me... Malika.

34:29.560 --> 34:32.359
- Malika?
- My sister.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.630
Right.

34:49.719 --> 34:50.915
Why are you here?

34:52.000 --> 34:53.070
What the fuck!

34:57.720 --> 34:58.949
What happened?

34:59.960 --> 35:01.519
I'm fed up. He drives me mad.

35:01.720 --> 35:04.838
- Did you quarrel with Dad?
- As usual. You know him.

35:06.320 --> 35:07.740
How did you get the travel money?

35:07.800 --> 35:08.836
I just did.

35:09.080 --> 35:11.231
- How?
- Baby-sitting left and right.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.620
Malika, can you get me a job?

35:13.680 --> 35:14.670
In your agency?

35:14.960 --> 35:16.394
- The estate agency.
- No.

35:16.600 --> 35:18.193
They always need help.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.596
- I can't.
- Your boss will hire me.

35:20.840 --> 35:21.830
It won't work.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.260
You're a school kid!

35:23.320 --> 35:24.595
Let me live with you.

35:24.880 --> 35:25.870
They won't let you.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.152
Dad will never allow it.
You know that. You're no dummy.

35:39.520 --> 35:40.840
Can you do me big favor?

35:42.360 --> 35:43.430
Depends.

35:45.880 --> 35:47.633
I have an important meeting.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.798
Can you take my sister to a film?

35:55.440 --> 35:57.557
What kind of movies does your sister like?

35:59.840 --> 36:01.160
Ask her.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.510
Okay.

36:08.440 --> 36:10.079
Why were you on my doorstep?

36:12.560 --> 36:13.471
Hmm?

36:15.800 --> 36:17.200
Do we go now?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.116
Yes.

36:21.600 --> 36:23.478
- Cool.
- Thank you.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.560
Let's go to the cinema.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.910
So, you know, there's no one in this room...

37:30.480 --> 37:33.040
Are you my sister's boyfriend?

37:34.840 --> 37:36.194
- No.
- Too bad.

37:36.720 --> 37:38.359
Do you have a girlfriend?

37:39.920 --> 37:42.071
- No.
- Do you want one?

39:11.840 --> 39:13.194
Is everything alright?

39:14.720 --> 39:15.710
Yes.

39:17.120 --> 39:20.557
I'm sorry. I don't know what's wrong with me.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.271
- Nothing serious?
- No, no.

39:26.480 --> 39:28.278
I don't feel very well.

39:30.080 --> 39:32.754
It's the first time something
like that happens to me.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.275
But it's okay.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.715
- I'm off. I'm in a hurry.
- Okay.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.239
- Okay.
- Take your time.

39:54.880 --> 39:56.360
Get some rest.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.314
Thank you. That's nice.

40:01.160 --> 40:02.958
- See you next week.
- Yeah.

40:32.680 --> 40:36.115
Gramps wanted to drive, but he was drunk.

40:36.320 --> 40:37.800
He didn't have his license.

40:38.000 --> 40:41.072
And at that time,
the cops were searching for him.

40:41.280 --> 40:43.670
Talk about being in a fix!

40:43.920 --> 40:45.798
So my grandmother hid...

40:48.680 --> 40:54.118
...behind the door to hide the keys
to prevent Gramps from taking them.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.279
And they...

40:56.920 --> 40:59.560
They had a row, and we had to separate them.

40:59.760 --> 41:03.914
Malika picked up the first thing
she could and threw it at him.

41:04.120 --> 41:05.395
It knocked him out.

41:05.640 --> 41:06.676
What a mess!

41:06.880 --> 41:07.916
We died laughing!

41:08.240 --> 41:09.993
Wait, I was scared.

41:10.440 --> 41:12.079
When you're scared, you're violent.

41:17.280 --> 41:20.273
It's your turn to tell a childhood memory.

41:21.240 --> 41:22.390
I don't have any.

41:24.280 --> 41:25.919
I don't have any memories.

41:30.720 --> 41:32.279
Anyway, it's time to go.

41:39.880 --> 41:41.553
You give this to Mom.

41:42.520 --> 41:43.636
Okay.

41:44.200 --> 41:45.316
Study hard.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.710
Sure.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.754
When you're 18, you can come.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.190
I'll wait for you.

41:52.480 --> 41:53.550
Okay.

41:53.760 --> 41:54.910
Anyway, I'll come see you.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.356
Really?

41:57.440 --> 41:58.635
I promise.

42:01.480 --> 42:02.675
Off you go.

42:05.240 --> 42:06.515
Be careful.

42:07.520 --> 42:09.079
I'll miss you.

42:26.600 --> 42:28.273
So what do you want to do now?

42:30.800 --> 42:32.634
Let's try to have some fun.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.754
We're lousy at having fun.

42:50.520 --> 42:52.193
Do you know this game?

42:52.880 --> 42:54.030
What game?

42:56.760 --> 42:59.192
- Do you know?
- Of course, I do.

42:59.680 --> 43:00.909
Want to play?

43:07.080 --> 43:09.959
<i>Un, deux</i>, three!

43:11.240 --> 43:15.120
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

43:16.800 --> 43:17.836
One more.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.860
One, two...

43:19.920 --> 43:20.990
Three.

43:22.360 --> 43:23.430
Again.

43:23.880 --> 43:26.759
One, two, three.

43:35.400 --> 43:37.676
- Do you want a drink?
- No.

45:42.640 --> 45:43.994
Shit, I fell asleep.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.320
I'll never go back to sleep.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.680
Do you want to come up?

46:01.920 --> 46:02.876
Yes.

46:19.960 --> 46:22.316
Lola! Lola!

46:23.400 --> 46:24.470
Come here, baby.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.149
I don't have any alcohol.

46:35.840 --> 46:37.160
How about hot chocolate?

46:38.080 --> 46:39.600
Okay.

47:45.880 --> 47:46.996
Thank you.

48:30.720 --> 48:36.159
In French, what's the difference
between a <i>baiser</i> and a <i>bisou?</i>

48:42.640 --> 48:43.580
Um...

48:43.640 --> 48:45.040
A <i>bisou</i> is...

48:45.760 --> 48:47.592
friendly and on the cheek.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.154
And a <i>baiser...</i>

48:50.400 --> 48:53.199
is more for lovers,

48:53.640 --> 48:54.596
on the mouth.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.476
Show me.

49:09.720 --> 49:10.836
<i>Bisou.</i>

49:20.840 --> 49:21.910
<i>Baiser.</i>

49:23.920 --> 49:25.832
I'm not quite sure I understand.

49:27.040 --> 49:28.360
Show me again.

50:02.560 --> 50:05.120
How do you have boyfriends
in your line of work?

50:08.160 --> 50:09.355
In my line of work?

50:09.680 --> 50:10.909
I know what you do.

50:11.200 --> 50:12.190
How so?

50:13.160 --> 50:15.072
I know you're not an estate agent.

50:16.800 --> 50:17.870
Are you a cop?

50:19.120 --> 50:20.031
So, you're a cop?

50:20.320 --> 50:21.959
No, I'm looking for this girl.

50:23.760 --> 50:24.637
Get out.

50:25.120 --> 50:26.180
She's a minor.

50:26.240 --> 50:27.260
Whatever, get out.

50:27.320 --> 50:29.277
I'm trying... I'm trying to find this girl.

50:29.680 --> 50:30.909
Get out, okay?

50:31.120 --> 50:32.349
Do you get that?

50:32.560 --> 50:33.835
Do you get that?

50:34.120 --> 50:35.634
Get out. Leave!

51:13.600 --> 51:14.875
Lola.

51:16.360 --> 51:17.430
Lola.

51:27.220 --> 51:28.740
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:28.800 --> 51:30.780
Thirty-Six Upper Street,
Electre Guichard. Okay?

51:30.840 --> 51:31.990
Okay. Thank you.

51:34.800 --> 51:36.340
- Be careful. Please.
- It'll be fine.

51:36.400 --> 51:37.595
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

52:15.840 --> 52:17.260
How are you, sweetie?

52:17.320 --> 52:18.276
Shut up.

52:19.960 --> 52:21.189
Do you know him?

52:22.560 --> 52:23.516
No.

53:07.600 --> 53:09.000
Need your fix, darling?

53:09.440 --> 53:10.840
Talk nicely to her...

53:11.080 --> 53:12.150
darling.

53:13.200 --> 53:14.316
I'm okay.

53:15.880 --> 53:17.030
I'm cold.

53:17.560 --> 53:18.676
You're cold?

53:19.400 --> 53:20.820
I'll turn on the heat.

53:20.880 --> 53:21.870
It can't hurt.

53:23.320 --> 53:24.879
I put a little heat for you.

53:44.600 --> 53:45.636
Thank you.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.792
Excuse me? No, this way.

56:14.920 --> 56:15.990
How old are you?

56:17.120 --> 56:18.270
How old are you?

56:18.960 --> 56:19.950
Eighteen.

56:22.200 --> 56:23.429
You should eat.

56:24.200 --> 56:25.714
You'll be hungry afterwards.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.556
Shit.

56:45.760 --> 56:47.080
Stop it.

57:16.280 --> 57:17.396
Come here.

57:21.400 --> 57:22.550
Calm down.

57:58.400 --> 58:01.632
Hey. Wake up. You need to prepare yourself.

58:02.640 --> 58:05.220
- Can I stay with you?
- No, no, no.

58:05.280 --> 58:06.509
Go to dress.

58:07.400 --> 58:08.500
Come on. Please.

58:08.560 --> 58:10.220
I'm not your mother. Go to room!

58:10.280 --> 58:12.192
- Don't scream.
- Fast.

58:19.280 --> 58:20.350
It is time.

58:52.200 --> 58:53.873
Why you didn't wait for me?

58:55.160 --> 58:56.480
Bad boys.

58:57.290 --> 58:59.043
Come on, jump.

59:09.600 --> 59:11.239
...get stuck inside.

59:15.120 --> 59:16.554
I'm here.

59:43.680 --> 59:44.875
Kiss each other.

59:45.960 --> 59:48.873
Kiss each other. Kiss, kiss, kiss.

59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.235
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.420
- Go on.
- Ow.

01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:24.700
Be nice, dad.

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.353
- Ow.
- Hey, calm down.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.580
Come, baby.

01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:28.915
Ow. ow.

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.740
What are you doing?

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:33.840
- Ow!
- Stop!

01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:39.039
- Come on, dad!
- Bad boy.

01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.180
Calm down. I'm coming.

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.551
Hey, hey, calm down. I'm jealous.

01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:48.580
I'm coming, okay?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.513
- Okay.
- Kiss daddy's belly.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:00:58.791
Hey.

01:00:59.840 --> 01:01:01.354
That's a little bit crazy.

01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:22.359
Front... get the...

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.713
Hey. What are you doing?

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.740
Stop! Enough! Stop! Stop!

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.678
Stop! Stop!

01:01:44.520 --> 01:01:45.556
Hey, stop!

01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.470
Go!

01:01:52.040 --> 01:01:54.350
I'll kill you, fucking little...

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.316
Come on.

01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:33.875
Hey! Stop! Stop, girls! Stop! Stop!

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.340
I said stop!

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.640
I just wanna talk to you, alright?

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.550
Stop!

01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:03.516
Quick!

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:40.356
Who are you?

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.156
Who are you?

01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.838
A sort of priest.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.272
I rescue girls like you.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.950
Well, minors mainly.

01:03:56.240 --> 01:03:57.310
Who pays?

01:03:58.400 --> 01:03:59.470
Charities.

01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.990
You must be kidding!

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.480
No. I'm going to drive Sofia home now.

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:08.710
Right now?

01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:18.512
Can you drive? I'm falling asleep.

01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:20.630
No.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.471
Stop the car. I'm going to throw up.

01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:28.840
I'll pull over then.

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.110
I'm screwed.

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:51.950
I'm screwed.

01:05:01.240 --> 01:05:04.714
<i>Sailing, sailing, over the bounding sea...</i>

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:09.316
<i>Over the bounding sea...</i>

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:13.996
<i>Sailing...</i>

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.589
Let's see.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.276
Yeah, I've got two rooms for you.

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.594
Let's get you into bed.

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:21.396
Sleep. It's okay. It's okay.

01:06:33.560 --> 01:06:34.755
Don't cry.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.638
I'll see if we can get a drink at the bar.

01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:42.835
You all right?

01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:57.397
You'll drive me to Electre's tomorrow.

01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.594
I'll pick up my dog.

01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.751
And I'll go see Raphäelle.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:05.990
Everything will be fine.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:09.590
Do you really think she is going
to let you get away with it?

01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:17.800
Do you want to start over like before?

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:20.590
Hmm.

01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:23.830
Yes.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.960
Exactly like before.

01:08:27.560 --> 01:08:29.233
Before meeting you.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.590
Goodnight.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.870
Goodnight.

01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:16.480
I can't sleep.

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.391
- Cigarette?
- Thank you.

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:15.796
Come here.

01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:21.833
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:13:22.240 --> 01:13:25.020
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.238
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:38.760
It's okay. You're afraid.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:07.380
Hello. Do you know
where is the guy in room 27?

01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:08.500
Has he left?

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:10.300
They left around six this morning.

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:11.460
The young lady was with him.

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.100
Everything has been paid for.

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:15.595
It is twenty past twelve, madam.
It is time to check out.

01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:51.155
Put this on.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.712
What do you want to be when you're grown up?

01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:17.478
I used to wanna be a writer.

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:27.912
What about you? What did you wanna do?

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:36.269
A girl.

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.876
Not a dog.

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:42.994
Just a girl, you know?

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:45.670
Yeah.

01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:01.940
Don't stare!

01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:04.590
I'll do as I want. You have no say about it.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.592
I can pull over and clobber you.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.476
You want me to?

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.115
You want me to?

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.396
Come on, move it!

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:20.319
Don't drag your feet.

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:23.190
Come on.

01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:27.593
Admit it, you messed up.

01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.476
Get in there!

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:01.720
Go get me a coffee, please.

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.115
Sit down.

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.800
You look awful.

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.517
I know.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:14.995
Oh, you know?

01:22:16.240 --> 01:22:18.197
You know you got me in trouble, too?

01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:24.720
The old man's better,
but you thrashed his son.

01:22:27.360 --> 01:22:29.113
This is really bad. Do you see?

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.199
- Do you realize?
- Yes.

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.551
I'm disappointed in you.

01:22:42.840 --> 01:22:44.559
I never expected this from you.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:47.840
Do you realize?

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.119
Do you realize this or not?

01:22:55.960 --> 01:22:57.235
Was it the girl?

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.159
She couldn't bear the beatings.

01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:01.916
We ran away. We walked and hitchhiked.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:03.875
We found a hotel.

01:23:04.760 --> 01:23:07.400
I fell asleep. When I woke, she was gone.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.795
She was traumatized.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:10.599
She's pretty, but too young.

01:23:11.200 --> 01:23:13.795
What can I say? Men want
younger and younger girls.

01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:16.235
That's not the issue.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.680
The thing is those blokes in the manor,
especially the older one...

01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.678
- And his son...
- Yes, I know.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:27.160
It won't happen again.

01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:34.919
You'll have to go away on holiday.

01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:37.597
You can't work looking like that.

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.599
Where to? Shall I arrange it?

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.916
No.

01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:53.833
Go get some rest.

01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:55.860
My birthday party's tonight.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.116
Come tarted up! Cook will pick you up.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.150
Come here.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.231
Come over here.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.074
Don't be childish.

01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.669
I was very scared.

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:21.915
Come here.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.154
I'm not a child anymore.

01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:55.680
We're here, Sofia.

01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:57.760
I'll be back in a minute.

01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:56.834
Wow, you look terrible.

01:26:58.560 --> 01:26:59.630
Plus, you're late.

01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:01.989
You all right?

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.555
I'm all right.

01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.070
My baby.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.792
Is Rupert your boyfriend now?

01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:11.780
No.

01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.559
Oh, come on, you can tell me.

01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:15.676
I said no.

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.439
You okay? You're being strange.

01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:18.996
I'm all right.

01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.070
I'll call you.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:25.676
Hold on. I know you.
I can see when things are wrong.

01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:28.020
No, you don't know me.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:29.100
What?

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.150
You don't know me.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:32.792
I'm a whore. Did you know that?

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.719
He can't be my boyfriend. I'm a whore.

01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:48.230
Yes, mate. Later.

01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.157
The hotel confirmed the info.

01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:55.633
The girls were with that bloke.

01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.940
I'll settle it with them tonight.

01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.195
You handle him.

01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:05.039
- You okay?
- No.

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:11.076
Later.

01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:52.154
Did you glam up for me?

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.230
Thanks.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:00.276
Don't look so sullen. Have fun. Mingle.

01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:03.871
We'll talk about the guy at the hotel.

01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:07.996
Have fun.

01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:52.277
This is hardly a relaxing party.

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:54.036
We're working.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.120
I can multitask. You can, too, right?

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.196
Who was the guy?

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:07.949
My boyfriend...

01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:11.833
He's not in this business.
I panicked and called him.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.793
You should have called me.

01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:17.035
I was scared.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.236
You've got a boyfriend?

01:31:27.680 --> 01:31:29.717
Since when? Is this recent?

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:30.797
Hmm.

01:31:33.040 --> 01:31:36.317
He's not really my boyfriend.
He's more like a friend.

01:31:42.080 --> 01:31:44.276
You've got no room for a love life.

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:45.740
Hmm.

01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:46.836
I know.

01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:48.594
Especially a man like him.

01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:50.200
He's not a friend.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:56.955
What makes you happy?

01:31:58.560 --> 01:31:59.755
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

01:32:02.520 --> 01:32:03.556
Everything.

01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:07.632
Everything I own. Everything I've earned.

01:32:11.240 --> 01:32:13.038
A nice life, the ease of things.

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:24.199
I've had a rough life, you know.

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.239
Like you, I guess.

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.439
If you work and don't screw up,
you could have my job in a few years.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.390
What do you think?

01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.714
What's that snide look?

01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:05.593
What's that snide look?

01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.792
You're pissing me off. What is this?

01:33:10.760 --> 01:33:12.080
Are you judging me?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.753
You think you're superior?

01:33:17.800 --> 01:33:19.393
Or you're stronger maybe?

01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:26.473
Hey, Virginie, you'd be crap without me.

01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:28.590
You know that?

01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.597
All the money you made is
thanks to me. You realize that?

01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.674
Hey, little whore, lower your gaze now.

01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:39.156
Lower your gaze!

01:33:39.960 --> 01:33:41.917
Do as I say! Lower your gaze!

01:33:42.440 --> 01:33:43.715
Lower your gaze now!

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.559
Do you hear me?

01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:47.631
Lower your gaze!

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.313
Sorry! Sorry! Hey!

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:53.260
Clobber her!

01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:54.879
Catch her and clobber her!

01:33:56.560 --> 01:33:57.550
Virginie!

01:34:18.720 --> 01:34:19.870
What are you doing?

01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:22.075
I'm tired of running.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.879
Virginie, help me!

01:34:31.240 --> 01:34:32.879
Who the fuck are you?

01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:34.919
Get the fuck out of here!

01:34:58.480 --> 01:35:01.359
Malika, stop! Stop!

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:11.870
Don't call me that.

01:35:14.720 --> 01:35:16.712
We don't know each other, okay?

01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:18.310
I know you.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:22.756
You don't.

01:35:25.520 --> 01:35:27.477
Your money is as filthy as mine.

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.355
I'll miss you.

01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.950
I know you.

01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:27.716
For sure.

01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:30.400
I'll miss you, too.

01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:32.516
For sure.

01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.957
- Take care of her.
- Promise.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:39.753
I'll come fetch her soon.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.477
Okay.

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.440
<i>...the final call for check-in.</i>

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:08.676
<i>Final call for check-in.</i>

01:38:15.480 --> 01:38:18.353
Welcome on board, sir.
Take your seat on the left side.

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.152
Aren't you tired of rescuing whores?

01:39:44.840 --> 01:39:47.435
I thought it was about time I saved myself.
