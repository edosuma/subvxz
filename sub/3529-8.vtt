~ Season 3- Episode 8 ~
"The Undoing of Cromwell"

02:50.499 --> 02:54.372
My lords, I do confess to you
that, although I have lain

02:54.472 --> 02:57.573
with the Queen almost every
night these past weeks,

02:57.673 --> 03:00.078
my conscience will not permit me
to consummate this marriage

03:00.178 --> 03:04.478
because I feel there is some
impediment to it.

03:04.948 --> 03:08.019
I have done as much as any man
to move the consent of my heart

03:08.119 --> 03:11.991
and mind, but the obstacle
will not out of my thoughts.

03:12.091 --> 03:15.493
Perhaps the truth is that
there existed a precontract

03:15.593 --> 03:18.465
between the Duke of Lorraine's
son and the Princess after all,

03:18.565 --> 03:22.203
from which she was never
released, and so therefore

03:22.303 --> 03:26.572
I am really married
to another man's wife.

03:28.209 --> 03:32.013
My lords, I leave it to you
to investigate

03:32.113 --> 03:35.892
whether or not my scruples
are justified.

03:37.719 --> 03:40.420
Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

03:53.302 --> 03:55.373
My Lord, you must
find some way

03:55.473 --> 03:58.733
to relieve His Majesty's
conscience.

04:03.081 --> 04:05.483
I tell you, Charles,
God will not grant me

04:05.583 --> 04:09.821
any more children
if I continue in this marriage.

04:09.921 --> 04:15.628
Was she such a maid that
she didn't know what to do?

04:15.728 --> 04:19.433
Not telling a woman what she
must expect on her wedding night

04:19.533 --> 04:24.705
is like sending a sailor
to sea with no biscuit.

04:24.805 --> 04:26.608
I will force Cromwell
to bring about a dissolution

04:26.708 --> 04:29.844
of the marriage. I only went
ahead with it for the sake

04:29.944 --> 04:34.534
of the realm and now even
that reason is forgot.

04:34.633 --> 04:37.088
The Emperor and the King of
France are at each other's

04:37.188 --> 04:42.667
throats again and both have come
courting. Who needs Cleves?

04:43.260 --> 04:49.566
My Lord Cromwell.
Was the match not his idea?

04:52.003 --> 04:55.243
Majesty,
the Princess Mary is here.

05:02.883 --> 05:06.116
Princess, if you please.

05:12.893 --> 05:15.462
I have received a letter
from a cousin of mine.

05:15.562 --> 05:17.464
He is Duke Philip of Bavaria.

05:17.564 --> 05:23.322
Philip would like to come to
England and pay court to you.

05:23.421 --> 05:26.141
Why?

05:26.241 --> 05:28.811
He has heard many things
about you, Princess Mary.

05:28.911 --> 05:31.464
Many good things.

05:31.564 --> 05:35.902
I suppose he's a Lutheran,
like you?

05:36.002 --> 05:41.376
He is charming
and very good looking.

05:41.476 --> 05:45.279
I think you might
like him a little.

05:45.379 --> 05:50.068
What shall I tell him?
- Tell him...

05:52.971 --> 05:56.509
Tell him he may come if he
pleases and if the King wishes.

05:56.609 --> 05:59.070
But not to expect anything.

06:22.505 --> 06:24.973
Father?

06:25.074 --> 06:27.145
Gregory!

06:27.244 --> 06:29.812
What on earth
are you doing here?

06:29.912 --> 06:31.614
Well, I noticed you forgot
your pills at the apothecary.

06:31.715 --> 06:34.756
I didn't want you to be in pain.

06:38.157 --> 06:41.658
Sit down.

06:47.934 --> 06:50.402
So what are you working on?
- I'm preparing some bills

06:50.502 --> 06:52.572
for Parliament
on the medical profession.

06:52.672 --> 06:55.009
And I'm trying
to persuade His Majesty

06:55.109 --> 07:00.181
to appoint councillors based
upon merit, and nothing else.

07:00.281 --> 07:03.084
You look tired, father.

07:07.421 --> 07:10.959
How is His Majesty?
- He's fine.

07:11.060 --> 07:15.266
His leg bothers him;
it gets sore. He gets irritable.

07:15.366 --> 07:19.965
Is that why he strikes you
on the head sometimes?

07:22.607 --> 07:25.610
I resent the King nothing,
but others seek to undermine me,

07:25.710 --> 07:29.830
since I was born so low
and they so high...

07:30.482 --> 07:34.253
And for other reasons too.

07:36.388 --> 07:39.475
Think not on that.

07:39.576 --> 07:41.962
Look after your own dear wife,
and the child in her belly.

07:42.062 --> 07:47.100
Love them as you love God
and His Holy Word,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.504
and all shall be well.

07:58.414 --> 08:00.549
I'm sorry you failed to
capture that arch traitor

08:00.649 --> 08:02.886
Reginald Pole, Sir Francis.

08:02.986 --> 08:06.672
The King detests him
above all men.

08:06.771 --> 08:11.445
However, he has other matters
on his mind now.

08:11.545 --> 08:13.563
When I last spoke to His Majesty
he confessed he was, in some

08:13.663 --> 08:18.405
ways, tired with his life.
- His life or his wife?

08:19.938 --> 08:23.474
They are much the same thing.

08:23.573 --> 08:28.715
Can he not find distraction,
as he has always done before?

08:28.815 --> 08:30.551
Easily. But he is
more jaded than before.

08:30.651 --> 08:33.501
The usual remedies won't suit.

08:33.601 --> 08:39.525
Something more... extreme...
Might tempt him.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.800
In this matter at least,
Your Grace,

08:45.900 --> 08:49.237
I shall not fail the King.

08:49.338 --> 08:51.906
My Lady.
- My Lady.

09:00.316 --> 09:02.468
Sir?

09:02.568 --> 09:06.458
Princess Mary, I hope
you can forgive my impetuosity.

09:06.558 --> 09:10.594
I know we should have been
formally introduced, but...

09:10.694 --> 09:15.400
I couldn't wait.
- You are Duke Philip?

09:17.571 --> 09:19.670
May I kiss your hand?

09:28.447 --> 09:31.152
I hope I might
see you again, my Lady.

09:31.252 --> 09:34.589
With my cousin the Queen
present, of course.

09:34.689 --> 09:39.689
I had thought to leave court
tomorrow for the country.

09:40.761 --> 09:44.766
I may delay my leaving,
if it pleases you.

09:46.267 --> 09:48.570
For a day or so.

09:56.713 --> 10:00.602
My sweet Francis,
I missed you!

10:00.701 --> 10:03.805
Handsome as ever.

10:03.905 --> 10:07.359
We haven't seen you for ages.
What have you been doing?

10:07.459 --> 10:11.097
Trying to kill someone.
- Did you manage it?

10:11.197 --> 10:13.748
Not yet.

10:13.848 --> 10:18.834
I suppose you've come to look
over my little darlings?

10:20.340 --> 10:25.320
Only after I've feasted
my eyes on you, my dear Lady.

10:25.846 --> 10:28.516
Go along. We have
some new ones, I think.

10:28.616 --> 10:31.937
Pretty little things.

10:32.037 --> 10:35.824
I sometimes find it hard to
believe that whoever bore them

10:35.924 --> 10:39.563
did not feel bothered
or obliged to raise them.

10:39.663 --> 10:42.096
You told me most of them
were bastards.

10:42.197 --> 10:46.135
But aristocratic bastards,
my sweet boy.

10:46.236 --> 10:49.440
Aristocratic bastards.

10:50.742 --> 10:54.093
Make a dress
for our doll.

10:54.193 --> 10:57.399
I think I've seen him
here before.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.656
Who do you think he is?
- I don't know.

11:04.756 --> 11:06.694
Do you think he's been
in a sword fight?

11:06.794 --> 11:09.454
Do you think he was?
- Sir?

11:35.759 --> 11:38.928
I have found someone
to amuse the King.

11:39.028 --> 11:40.948
Who is she?

11:41.047 --> 11:43.902
Her name is Miss Katherine Howard. She is
a distant relation to the Duke of Norfolk.

11:44.002 --> 11:46.572
Her background is...
How shall I say?

11:46.672 --> 11:49.873
Not entirely conventional.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.980
I assume she's young
and pretty.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.460
See for yourself, my Lord.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.487
You may come in now.

12:07.293 --> 12:11.365
Katherine, these are the
excellent people I told you of:

12:11.465 --> 12:13.503
His Grace,
the Duke of Suffolk,

12:13.603 --> 12:16.453
and the Earl of Hertford.

12:16.553 --> 12:18.706
Your Graces.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.643
How old are you, Katherine?

12:20.743 --> 12:22.879
Seventeen.

12:22.978 --> 12:25.715
I wonder who
taught her to count.

12:25.815 --> 12:29.185
Tell us something about
yourself. Your family. So on.

12:29.285 --> 12:33.074
My mother died
when I was little.

12:33.174 --> 12:37.194
My father remarried, but
I didn't know his wife really.

12:37.294 --> 12:39.464
I was sent to live
in the household

12:39.564 --> 12:41.467
of the Dowager Duchess.

12:41.567 --> 12:43.869
That would be the Dowager
Duchess of Norfolk?

12:43.969 --> 12:47.073
The widow of the second Duke
- I suppose so, my Lord.

12:47.173 --> 12:49.775
I didn't see her much.

12:49.875 --> 12:54.147
There were other children there,
from lots of marriages.

12:54.247 --> 12:59.570
We ran a little wild.
There was some fun in it.

12:59.670 --> 13:01.887
Well, sweet Katherine,

13:01.987 --> 13:05.093
I think the fun is
just about to start again.

13:05.193 --> 13:08.012
What do you think, Your Grace?

13:08.112 --> 13:10.566
I think...

13:13.334 --> 13:17.023
I think she looks
fit for a king.

13:17.123 --> 13:21.110
So, did you talk
to him? To Philip?

13:21.210 --> 13:23.712
A little. Yes.

13:23.813 --> 13:27.452
I believe he is a very
intelligent young man.

13:27.552 --> 13:30.153
I couldn't tell.

13:30.252 --> 13:33.692
And extremely good-looking.
He likes you a great deal.

13:33.792 --> 13:38.553
He doesn't even know me.
We have nothing in common.

13:39.865 --> 13:43.703
Your Majesty, Duke Philip
asks for an audience.

13:43.803 --> 13:48.843
I don't want to see him.
- Then go in there! Quickly.

13:55.216 --> 13:58.101
Ah, Philip.
My dear cousin.

13:58.201 --> 14:00.286
Majesty.

14:03.759 --> 14:05.963
How do you
find this country?

14:06.063 --> 14:08.161
I like it very much.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.135
I could most happily live here.

14:12.235 --> 14:15.088
So, you've met Princess Mary?

14:15.189 --> 14:18.976
It was only for a moment,
but I relive that moment

14:19.076 --> 14:21.978
over and over again in my mind.

14:25.417 --> 14:27.820
I was told before that she was
charming, intelligent,

14:27.920 --> 14:31.490
well-read, gracious. The true
heir of Katherine of Aragon.

14:31.590 --> 14:34.044
A true Princess.

14:34.144 --> 14:37.980
But nothing prepared me
for her beauty.

14:38.079 --> 14:41.445
But a beauty that comes
from inside.

14:44.771 --> 14:50.073
To me, she is the most beautiful
creature on God's earth.

14:51.346 --> 14:55.783
¶

15:04.928 --> 15:07.364
The Council has acted upon
Your Majesty's request.

15:07.464 --> 15:11.069
We demanded written evidence
of the Queen's envoy

15:11.169 --> 15:14.171
about the pre-marriage contract
to the Duke of Lorraine's son.

15:14.271 --> 15:18.311
They provided it, but the papers
seem to suggest that,

15:18.411 --> 15:21.912
instead of the usual formula,
"per verba de futuro",

15:22.012 --> 15:24.317
the actual wording
on the document reads

15:24.417 --> 15:29.607
"per verba de presenti",
which is a binding contract

15:29.707 --> 15:33.326
which renunciation cannot undo.
- So it does seem

15:33.426 --> 15:37.668
that Your Majesty has reason
to be optimistic.

16:02.760 --> 16:06.298
The King has noticed you.
He may ask to see you.

16:06.398 --> 16:09.800
What shall I say to him?
What should I do?

16:09.900 --> 16:12.001
Just be yourself.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.674
Who is that girl?

16:19.311 --> 16:21.814
That is Katherine Howard.

16:21.914 --> 16:24.618
She is a relation
to the Duke of Norfolk.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.697
She has only just come to court.

16:36.931 --> 16:40.018
Bring her to me.

16:40.117 --> 16:42.203
Majesty.

16:47.778 --> 16:51.414
Majesty, Miss Katherine Howard.

16:51.514 --> 16:53.583
Thank you, Charles.

17:00.826 --> 17:03.027
Katherine.

17:05.531 --> 17:07.933
Your Majesty.

17:08.032 --> 17:11.738
Please, be seated here.

17:22.451 --> 17:24.234
Are you married?

17:24.334 --> 17:27.755
No, Your Majesty.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.344
Can you read?

17:32.443 --> 17:36.533
Enough to write a letter.
- Who writes to you?

17:36.633 --> 17:39.769
Nobody.

17:39.870 --> 17:42.089
Do you have many houses?

18:10.536 --> 18:12.757
Ouch!
- What is it?

18:12.856 --> 18:15.059
You stepped on my foot.

18:15.159 --> 18:18.715
Philip, I'm so very sorry!

18:18.814 --> 18:20.915
I do apologize. I'm so sorry.

18:21.015 --> 18:23.116
Philip, I'm so sorry!

18:26.990 --> 18:29.625
I thought-
- You didn't step on my foot.

18:29.725 --> 18:34.647
How could you? Your feet
don't even touch the ground.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.968
I wanted a moment
alone with you.

18:38.068 --> 18:40.603
I...

18:58.157 --> 19:00.293
You're crying.

19:00.392 --> 19:04.264
Only because I'm so happy.

19:07.133 --> 19:10.575
Would you like me
to kiss you again?

19:32.298 --> 19:35.977
Do you know where
this ring comes from?

19:36.567 --> 19:39.104
It once adorned the shrine
of Thomas Becket at Canterbury.

19:39.204 --> 19:41.975
The whole shrine
glittered with jewels,

19:42.075 --> 19:45.077
left by princes and pilgrims.

19:45.176 --> 19:47.447
But this ring...

19:47.546 --> 19:50.151
This ring was the most
valuable gift of all.

19:50.251 --> 19:52.902
A King of France left it

19:53.002 --> 19:56.667
as an offering
to save his mortal soul.

19:56.824 --> 19:59.694
May I touch it?

21:52.756 --> 21:55.607
Good night, Princess.

21:55.707 --> 21:58.828
Good night, Your Grace.

22:19.285 --> 22:22.655
Tell me, Mr. Cromwell,
how is work proceeding

22:22.755 --> 22:24.758
on my palace at Nonsuch?

22:24.858 --> 22:26.826
I am pleased to report
that it is almost complete,

22:26.926 --> 22:29.665
and will be ready for your
personal inspection come July.

22:29.765 --> 22:31.863
Good.

22:36.471 --> 22:38.607
I want to give a gift of land
to Mistress Katherine Howard.

22:38.707 --> 22:40.909
There is some we recently
confiscated from a felon

22:41.009 --> 22:46.090
if I remember correctly.
With two large houses upon it?

22:47.851 --> 22:52.070
I wish to grant the whole
to Mistress Howard.

22:52.823 --> 22:55.842
Majesty.

22:55.942 --> 22:57.629
I hear the Council
found a flaw

22:57.729 --> 22:59.663
in the Queen's precontract.

22:59.763 --> 23:03.768
It was not such a flaw
that it could not be overcome

23:03.868 --> 23:05.738
by the Queen's
personal repudiation.

23:05.838 --> 23:07.707
There must still be grounds.

23:07.807 --> 23:12.167
Before God, I think she is not
my lawful wife.

23:23.691 --> 23:25.895
Whatever people say,
Mr. Cromwell,

23:25.995 --> 23:28.228
either to your face
or behind your back,

23:28.328 --> 23:31.516
you are still
my first minister,

23:31.616 --> 23:36.372
whose love and loyalty I have
no cause nor reason to doubt.

23:36.472 --> 23:41.094
If there is anything
important to be done,

23:41.193 --> 23:43.598
I know who best to do it.

23:50.421 --> 23:52.521
Majesty.

24:02.335 --> 24:04.003
Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Cromwell, sir!

24:04.103 --> 24:07.840
Mr. Cromwell!
- Mr. Risley.

24:07.940 --> 24:11.513
Give it to Mr. Risley
- We're doing our best.

24:11.613 --> 24:15.416
We'll do our best for you.
Very good, very good, very good.

24:15.516 --> 24:20.197
Mr. Risley! Thank you sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

24:22.923 --> 24:24.442
Your Majesty.

24:24.541 --> 24:26.428
How was your meeting
with the French Ambassador?

24:26.528 --> 24:30.434
It was very interesting,
Your Majesty. He told me that

24:30.534 --> 24:32.468
the King was not
averse to opening

24:32.568 --> 24:36.106
secret negotiations with us with
a view to disengaging the French

24:36.206 --> 24:37.942
from their disagreeable
alliance with the Emperor.

24:38.042 --> 24:40.143
Good.

24:40.244 --> 24:43.013
The Ambassador
also suggested to me

24:43.113 --> 24:46.217
how much Anglo-French
relations would improve

24:46.317 --> 24:51.537
if Lord Cromwell no longer
stood as an obstacle to them.

25:40.245 --> 25:45.085
Mistress Howard?

25:45.184 --> 25:49.120
The King would like
you to accept a gift.

25:58.532 --> 26:01.001
It's lovely.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.971
You must thank His Majesty.

26:06.206 --> 26:09.410
You can thank him yourself.

26:19.724 --> 26:21.824
Your Majesty.

28:45.654 --> 28:49.424
Come.

28:54.096 --> 28:59.253
Bishop Gardiner.
Just the man we needed.

28:59.352 --> 29:02.406
Now, we may begin.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.403
Gregory? What is it?

29:14.502 --> 29:19.859
It's a boy. I have a son.

29:25.399 --> 29:28.535
Thanks be to God...

29:33.941 --> 29:36.423
Prince Edward, Your Majesty.

29:42.251 --> 29:48.225
My son.

30:05.345 --> 30:07.981
Gentlemen, I call this council
meeting to order-

30:08.081 --> 30:10.182
Cromwell, do not sit there.

30:10.282 --> 30:11.918
That is no place for you.

30:12.018 --> 30:14.155
Traitors do not sit
among gentlemen.

30:14.255 --> 30:18.657
My Lord Cromwell,
you are arrested for treason.

30:23.265 --> 30:25.366
I am no traitor.

30:27.968 --> 30:30.840
I ask you, on your consciences,
am I a traitor?

30:30.940 --> 30:34.277
Yes! Traitor! Traitor!
- Traitor! Traitor!

30:34.377 --> 30:36.937
Traitor! Traitor!
- Traitor!

30:40.183 --> 30:43.454
I am no traitor!
I am no traitor!

30:45.955 --> 30:48.057
I'm no traitor!

30:52.831 --> 30:54.982
No... No, no. NO!

30:55.082 --> 30:57.301
I'M NO TRAITOR!

31:12.755 --> 31:15.806
Princess Mary, do sit down.

31:15.906 --> 31:19.260
I have some... some news.

31:29.172 --> 31:32.742
Duke Philip has been
sent back to Bavaria.

31:32.842 --> 31:36.146
Your father, the King,

31:36.246 --> 31:40.620
sent him away. I am so sorry.
I cannot explain.

31:40.719 --> 31:44.745
No need to explain.
It is of little matter.

31:47.626 --> 31:50.463
The Duke was charming

31:52.497 --> 31:55.135
but I would never
have married him.

31:55.235 --> 31:58.815
He is a Lutheran
and I am a Catholic.

32:34.346 --> 32:39.250
My lords, I am come here to
introduce a bill of attainder

32:39.351 --> 32:43.956
against Thomas Cromwell
on a charge of treason.

32:46.527 --> 32:50.831
Lord Cromwell, whom His Majesty
has raised from a very base

32:50.931 --> 32:54.702
and low degree, and enriched
with manifold gifts,

32:54.802 --> 33:00.274
is proved to be a most false and
corrupt traitor and deceiver.

33:00.374 --> 33:05.746
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

33:05.846 --> 33:08.051
Being a detestable heretic,

33:08.151 --> 33:13.106
he has utterly disposed to set
and sow common sedition

33:13.205 --> 33:17.416
among Your Majesty's
loyal and loving subjects.

33:18.695 --> 33:22.534
As the vice-regent for religion
supposed to oversee reform,

33:22.634 --> 33:26.954
Cromwell has, without
His Majesty's knowledge,

33:27.054 --> 33:31.578
licensed heretics
to preach and teach.

33:31.677 --> 33:36.983
My lords, we have evidence that
on the night of March the 31st,

33:37.083 --> 33:40.420
in the parish of
St. Peter the Poor,

33:40.520 --> 33:43.022
Lord Cromwell
did arrogantly defend

33:43.122 --> 33:46.242
these heretic preachers.

33:46.342 --> 33:50.782
He said if the King
should turn against reform,

33:50.882 --> 33:55.202
he would not turn.
And if the King did turn,

33:55.302 --> 33:58.008
and all his followers,
then he would stand fighting

33:58.108 --> 34:01.609
in the field with his sword
in his hand, against the King

34:01.709 --> 34:03.813
and against all his followers.

34:03.913 --> 34:06.683
And he took out
his dagger, and he said,

34:06.783 --> 34:09.955
"Or let this dagger
thrust me to the heart,

34:10.054 --> 34:12.121
"if I would not die
for that quarrel.

34:12.222 --> 34:14.760
"And if I should
live a year or two,

34:14.860 --> 34:17.262
"then it will no longer be
in the King's power

34:17.362 --> 34:21.099
any more to resist or hinder
our reformation. "

34:21.199 --> 34:23.435
And he swore
a great oath!

34:23.534 --> 34:26.739
Traitor!
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!

34:31.511 --> 34:34.982
Is it true that you loved
this man, Sir Richard?

34:35.081 --> 34:37.385
As a friend.

34:37.485 --> 34:39.987
But I chiefly loved him for the
love I thought I saw him bear

34:40.087 --> 34:42.924
towards the King
above all others.

34:43.024 --> 34:46.562
But now, if he be a traitor,
then I am sorry

34:46.661 --> 34:48.763
that I ever loved him
or trusted him,

34:48.862 --> 34:54.670
and I am very glad that his
treason is discovered in time.

34:54.770 --> 34:57.079
Traitor!
Traitor! Justice!

35:13.592 --> 35:16.295
I trust, Madam, you are
happy and well treated?

35:16.395 --> 35:19.364
I have no complaints
whatsoever.

35:19.464 --> 35:24.054
Everywhere I go I am treated
with great respect

35:24.154 --> 35:26.638
and kindness from everyone.

35:26.738 --> 35:30.510
I'm glad.

35:35.049 --> 35:37.984
You are not eating.

35:48.197 --> 35:51.118
Your Majesty...

35:51.217 --> 35:53.188
I... I wondered-

35:53.287 --> 35:57.141
I am sending you away for a
while, to my palace at Richmond.

35:57.241 --> 36:02.046
For your health,
and for your pleasure.

36:03.915 --> 36:07.819
Thank you, Your Majesty.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.299
I have some urgent business
to attend to.

36:18.399 --> 36:21.268
Madam.

36:32.113 --> 36:34.016
The Council considers it
sufficient,

36:34.116 --> 36:36.486
as Head of the Church,
that you can have

36:36.586 --> 36:39.772
the bishops annul your union.

36:39.872 --> 36:43.659
But it would be more diplomatic

36:43.759 --> 36:45.997
if you should find proof
that the marriage

36:46.098 --> 36:48.083
was never consummated

36:48.182 --> 36:52.169
and that Your Majesty never
truly consented to it.

36:52.270 --> 36:55.506
Send a deputation
to Mr. Cromwell.

36:55.607 --> 37:00.312
Demand of him written evidence
supporting my annulment.

37:00.412 --> 37:03.116
Doubtless he'll remember
how often I spoke to him

37:03.216 --> 37:06.819
of how my nature
abhors that woman...

37:23.172 --> 37:24.858
Mr. Cromwell.

37:24.957 --> 37:27.041
Your Grace.

37:27.141 --> 37:29.178
The King orders that
you write him a letter,

37:29.278 --> 37:31.515
describing how he found
Anne of Cleves,

37:31.615 --> 37:34.317
what passed between you
on that subject,

37:34.417 --> 37:37.521
and whether he told you
he had consummated

37:37.621 --> 37:40.607
his so-called marriage or not.

37:40.706 --> 37:46.730
He also orders you to describe
the impediments to the marriage,

37:46.829 --> 37:51.119
and whether knowing them
you still arranged it.

37:52.204 --> 37:57.025
His Majesty charges that,
as you will answer God

37:57.125 --> 38:00.197
on the dreadful day of judgment,

38:00.297 --> 38:03.851
and also upon the extreme danger
and damnation of your soul

38:03.951 --> 38:08.788
and conscience, to write down
exactly what you know.

38:11.394 --> 38:13.229
I will most gladly do
as the King commands.

38:13.327 --> 38:18.050
I trust to his pleasure
and satisfaction.

38:18.150 --> 38:21.705
I desire more than anything else
the King's comfort,

38:21.805 --> 38:25.184
and would most willingly
die for it.

38:27.578 --> 38:32.798
I wondered if you could see
your house from that window?

38:36.321 --> 38:39.291
The fact is, Mr. Cromwell,

38:39.391 --> 38:42.527
that only two hours
after your arrest

38:42.627 --> 38:44.397
the King dispatched
his Treasurer there

38:44.497 --> 38:49.102
to take away your goods.

38:51.370 --> 38:54.892
The rabble came out
to cheer them on.

38:55.710 --> 39:00.747
It was a pretty sight, I hear.

39:04.218 --> 39:07.456
Guard.

39:27.813 --> 39:29.714
"Finding Your Majesty
not as pleased

39:29.814 --> 39:31.850
"as I trusted to have done,
I was so bold

39:31.950 --> 39:34.187
"to ask you how
you liked the Queen.

39:34.287 --> 39:36.623
"Your Majesty soberly answered,

39:36.723 --> 39:39.157
"As you know, I liked her
not well before,

39:39.258 --> 39:41.794
"but now I like her much worse.

39:41.894 --> 39:43.797
"I have felt her belly
and her breasts

39:43.897 --> 39:49.686
"and thereby, as I can judge,
she should be no maid.

39:49.786 --> 39:53.871
I left her as good a maid
as I found her!"

39:55.177 --> 39:59.056
At the end.
What does he say at the end?

40:02.953 --> 40:05.022
"I beseech
Your Majesty most humbly

40:05.122 --> 40:07.824
"to pardon my rude writing
and to consider that I,

40:07.924 --> 40:12.947
"a most woeful prisoner,
am ready to take the death,

40:13.047 --> 40:17.169
when it shall please
God and Your Majesty. "

40:22.241 --> 40:24.242
"Yet the frail flesh
incites me

40:24.342 --> 40:26.979
"continually to call
to Your Grace for mercy

40:27.079 --> 40:30.333
"and grace for my offences,

40:30.432 --> 40:34.019
"and thus Christ save,
preserve, and keep you...

40:34.119 --> 40:37.641
"Written at the Tower
this Wednesday,

40:37.741 --> 40:42.597
"...the last of June with
heavy heart and trembling hand

40:42.695 --> 40:45.366
"of Your Highness' most heavy
and miserable prisoner

40:45.466 --> 40:48.453
and poor slave. "

40:48.553 --> 40:52.937
He's written something
right down at the bottom.

40:59.149 --> 41:05.221
"Most gracious prince,
I cry for mercy, mercy.

41:08.726 --> 41:11.160
Mercy. "

41:47.604 --> 41:49.638
Will Your Grace be
on Tower Hill tomorrow?

41:49.738 --> 41:51.958
Try to keep me away.

41:52.057 --> 41:54.378
I can vouchsafe to Your Grace

41:54.478 --> 41:57.680
his final end will be
the most ignominious ever.

41:57.780 --> 42:00.551
So I have heard, Your Grace.
So I have heard.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.821
What is he talking about?
Tell me.

42:02.921 --> 42:05.124
Cromwell is set to appear
on the same scaffold

42:05.224 --> 42:07.858
as Lord Hungerford...
Otherwise known as Mad Walter,

42:07.958 --> 42:10.696
who has been sentenced to death
for various offences

42:10.796 --> 42:13.833
such as sodomy,
raping his daughter,

42:13.933 --> 42:17.303
and paying magicians to predict
the date of the King's death.

42:17.403 --> 42:19.472
At least he won't
have to pay them

42:19.572 --> 42:21.943
to predict the date of his own.

42:22.043 --> 42:24.813
Then Cromwell
will be humiliated.

42:24.913 --> 42:28.650
The false churl who was
so ambitious for others' blood!

42:28.750 --> 42:31.686
Ah, that is not
our only device.

42:31.786 --> 42:35.556
Tom and I have conceived
some more sport

42:35.656 --> 42:38.009
at His Lordship's expense.

42:38.108 --> 42:41.397
What kind of sport?

42:41.498 --> 42:43.383
Patience Edward.

42:43.482 --> 42:46.635
Patience.

42:51.877 --> 42:54.243
Let's have another beer.

42:56.113 --> 42:59.084
Sorry, there; I've forgotten
your name, fellow.

42:59.184 --> 43:01.855
What is it again?
- Gurrea, sir.

43:01.955 --> 43:07.226
Gurrea. D'you have the pox
or is it gone, 'urrea?

43:10.831 --> 43:12.465
It's a big day tomorrow.

43:12.565 --> 43:15.300
I ought to be abed.

43:15.401 --> 43:18.806
A last pint! I'm paying.

43:18.907 --> 43:22.746
And then let's drink
to old friends, huh?

43:24.412 --> 43:27.012
Two more pints, my good man!

43:59.451 --> 44:01.619
Master Gurrea,

44:01.720 --> 44:06.142
I trust you're feeling
clear-headed this morning.

44:15.304 --> 44:18.683
Madam, the Earl of Hartford
is come.

44:24.047 --> 44:26.200
My lords.

44:26.299 --> 44:30.286
Madam, it is my duty to
inform you that Parliament,

44:30.387 --> 44:32.757
the convocations
of Canterbury and York

44:32.857 --> 44:36.961
have found your marriage
to the King to be invalid

44:37.061 --> 44:39.997
on the grounds of your
precontract with Lorraine,

44:40.097 --> 44:43.236
His Majesty's lack of consent
to the marriage,

44:43.336 --> 44:46.353
and its non-consummation.

44:46.453 --> 44:51.160
The marriage is thus declared
null and void,

44:51.260 --> 44:53.448
and from henceforth it is
the King's pleasure

44:53.548 --> 44:56.706
that you call yourself
his sister.

44:59.053 --> 45:02.055
Do you consent?

45:06.561 --> 45:08.496
In which case,
I can tell you that the King

45:08.596 --> 45:10.699
has settled upon you
a handsome annuity

45:10.799 --> 45:12.769
of 4,000 pounds per annum,

45:12.869 --> 45:15.271
as well as the manors
of Bletchingly and Richmond,

45:15.371 --> 45:18.675
and also Hever Castle, so long
as you remain in England.

45:18.775 --> 45:23.012
And since His Majesty confirms
that you are still a maid,

45:23.112 --> 45:26.714
you are free to marry
whom you choose.

45:29.755 --> 45:32.306
Please...

45:32.406 --> 45:35.192
tell the King that...

45:37.664 --> 45:41.883
I hope I will sometimes
have the pleasure

45:41.983 --> 45:44.937
of his most noble presence,

45:45.037 --> 45:50.844
and beseech the Almighty to send
him long life and good health.

46:04.092 --> 46:06.194
Oh, my Lady.

46:08.065 --> 46:09.714
Father!

46:09.813 --> 46:13.536
Father.

46:38.330 --> 46:43.354
Good people,

46:43.453 --> 46:45.558
I am come here to die,

46:48.108 --> 46:53.010
and not to purge myself,
as some may think I should.

46:54.316 --> 46:56.985
I am by law condemned to die
and I thank my Lord God

46:57.085 --> 46:59.788
that has granted me
this death for my offence.

46:59.888 --> 47:02.793
For since I came of age
I have lived as a sinner

47:02.893 --> 47:05.610
and offended my Lord God,

47:05.710 --> 47:07.865
for which I ask Him heartily
for forgiveness.

47:07.965 --> 47:13.027
Get it over with! For Christ's
sake, get it over with!

47:14.672 --> 47:17.308
I have also offended
my Prince,

47:17.408 --> 47:21.079
for which I ask him
hearty amnesty.

47:24.683 --> 47:28.654
I heartily desire you to pray
for the King's Grace

47:28.754 --> 47:33.893
and that he may long live with
you in health and prosperity.

47:33.993 --> 47:37.499
and that after him his son,
Prince Edward,

47:37.599 --> 47:40.267
may long reign over you.

47:45.006 --> 47:49.310
There it is. Nonsuch Palace.

47:53.749 --> 47:56.810
My Fool told me
it didn't exist.

48:11.469 --> 48:13.788
Gentlemen,

48:13.888 --> 48:16.509
you should all take
warning from me,

48:16.609 --> 48:18.978
who was, as you know, from
a poor man made by the Prince

48:19.078 --> 48:22.281
into a great gentleman
and that I,

48:22.381 --> 48:24.717
not contented with that,
not with having the kingdom

48:24.817 --> 48:29.488
at my orders, presumed
to a still higher state.

48:32.227 --> 48:37.899
My pride has brought
its punishment.

48:48.778 --> 48:51.849
Lord, grant me that when these
eyes shall lose their use,

48:51.949 --> 48:55.203
the eyes of my soul
may see Thee.

48:55.302 --> 48:57.821
God Lord and father, that when
this mouth shall lose his use...

48:57.921 --> 48:59.774
Kill him!

48:59.873 --> 49:01.793
...that my heart
will say unto Thee:

49:01.893 --> 49:05.198
Father, into your hands
I commend my spirit.

49:05.298 --> 49:08.276
Come on now!
Take his head off!

49:10.237 --> 49:13.807
Pray for the Prince and
for the Lords of the Council

49:13.907 --> 49:19.162
and for the clergy
and for the people.

49:19.262 --> 49:21.917
Now I beg you again that
you will pray for me.

49:22.017 --> 49:26.856
Pray, if possible, cut off
the head with one blow...

49:29.825 --> 49:32.393
that I may not suffer much.

49:33.305 --> 49:39.316
