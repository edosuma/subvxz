CHRIS ROCK:
I always felt like
an outsider at Corleone,

00:07.375 --> 00:08.576
but I never felt more
like an outsider

00:08.676 --> 00:11.179
than when it was time
for the ninth grade dance.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.313
So, you going to the dance?

00:12.413 --> 00:14.048
You're joking, right?

00:14.148 --> 00:16.084
No, seriously. I think
it's going to be cool.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.085
For who?

00:17.185 --> 00:18.186
When it came to dances,

00:19.320 --> 00:20.254
there were two kinds:
the white kind...

00:22.356 --> 00:23.757
...and the black kind.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.129
Why would I go to
that dance anyway?

00:28.229 --> 00:30.098
It's just a bunch
of people who hate me,

00:30.198 --> 00:31.799
hating me in a room
while dancing.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.368
We could film it and call it
Dancing with the Bigots.

00:34.468 --> 00:35.636
Well, I'm going.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.505
Yeah, right.

00:37.605 --> 00:38.806
With who?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.574
What are you looking at?

00:40.674 --> 00:41.642
Not her!

00:41.742 --> 00:42.810
Look. There's only

00:43.977 --> 00:45.146
so many athletes. They
can't get all the girls.

00:45.946 --> 00:46.680
Try telling that to the Knicks.

00:47.548 --> 00:48.482
Dude, come on. I mean,
when you look back

00:49.350 --> 00:50.118
on your last year
in junior high school,

00:50.818 --> 00:51.252
what are you gonna tell people?

00:52.486 --> 00:53.654
"I got my ass kicked
at the ninth grade dance."

00:54.988 --> 00:56.657
Look, man, I want to go, but if
you haven't noticed, I'm black.

00:56.757 --> 00:58.226
Who's gonna want
to go with me?

00:58.326 --> 01:00.228
Maybe Bubbles the chimp
has a sister.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.830
Unfortunately, she said no.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.307
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.432
CHRIS ROCK:
I thought I had made
my mind up about the dance,

01:38.532 --> 01:40.201
but at home,
it was a split decision.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.835
So, you don't want
to go to your dance?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.405
JULIUS:
I don't blame him
for not going.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.307
He's the only black kid
in an all-white school.

01:46.407 --> 01:47.708
Believe me:
I know what that's like.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.443
You went
to an all

01:49.543 --> 01:50.744
I went to an all-white world.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.580
Everything's
all white:

01:52.680 --> 01:55.749
schools, the grocery stores,
the laundromats.

01:55.849 --> 01:56.584
The NBA.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.686
So, did you go
to your school dance?

01:58.786 --> 02:00.188
Yeah, I took this girl.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.122
What was her name again?

02:02.223 --> 02:05.459
Her name was "I haven't spoken
to her in 25 years."

02:06.527 --> 02:07.661
Well, how was the dance?

02:07.761 --> 02:08.862
It wasn't good.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.331
I hated the music.

02:10.431 --> 02:11.665
The food was strange.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.601
And, oh, yeah,
I was the only black guy.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.470
Well, you know, it all
worked out in the end.

02:16.570 --> 02:18.606
I mean, if you would have had
a good time

02:18.706 --> 02:21.175
with whatever her name is,
you might not have met me.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.877
You had a good time at your
dance, and you still met me.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.347
Sure did.
How come I couldn't
have a good time?

02:26.447 --> 02:29.417
I'm not saying that
you couldn't have a good time.
You just said...

02:29.517 --> 02:31.285
I did not. I'm just
saying it's funny

02:31.385 --> 02:32.520
how you don't remember her name
after all these years.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.388
That's exactly what you're
saying. It's... Nothing funny...

02:35.723 --> 02:35.756
Everybody remembers the name of
the date they took to the prom.

02:36.957 --> 02:37.758
Why do I have to remember
her name? It was 25 years ago.

02:38.892 --> 02:38.926
I was just having
a loving moment.
What does that mean?

02:40.194 --> 02:41.629
Yes, they are arguing
about a 25-year-old dance

02:42.763 --> 02:43.797
where they didn't even know
each other.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.899
MAN:
Hey, think fast.

02:45.999 --> 02:47.167
DREW:
Hey, Uncle Ryan!

02:47.268 --> 02:49.637
What's up?

02:49.737 --> 02:50.738
Ryan?

02:50.838 --> 02:52.640
Man, why you got
to say it like that?

02:52.740 --> 02:54.542
You sound like I found you
in witness protection.

02:54.642 --> 02:57.645
All I want to know is, what
big plans you have this time.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.912
Why I got to have big plans?

03:00.047 --> 03:01.215
How come I can't just be coming
through to say hello?

03:01.315 --> 03:02.483
Because you're not.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.618
All right, you want to know?

03:04.718 --> 03:05.753
I'm going to tell you.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.288
I'm opening a car dealership.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.522
Oh!
Go, Drew.

03:09.657 --> 03:10.558
My Uncle Ryan
was Drew's favorite uncle

03:11.759 --> 03:13.527
because he was a dreamer,
and his dream was

03:13.627 --> 03:14.928
to open a successful business.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.797
He had some bad ideas.

03:16.897 --> 03:18.699
RYAN:
Fried bread crust.

03:18.799 --> 03:20.534
Fried bread crust?

03:20.634 --> 03:22.670
Some people like the inside
of the bread.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.938
This is for people
that like the outside.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.608
This is for people
who like bypass surgery.

03:27.708 --> 03:28.842
Mmm!

03:28.942 --> 03:31.645
How much you need?

03:32.546 --> 03:33.947
And a couple of good ideas.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.849
They got 31 flavors
of ice cream.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.685
I got 31 flavors
of chocolate milk.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.620
Swiss chocolate,
cinnamon chocolate,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.422
raspberry chocolate,

03:41.522 --> 03:43.291
maple chocolate,
peanut butter chocolate.

03:43.391 --> 03:44.992
You got to get in on this.

03:45.092 --> 03:46.427
Well, what flavor is this?

03:46.527 --> 03:47.261
This is milk chocolate.

03:48.028 --> 03:48.829
Milk chocolate
chocolate milk?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.299
Official drink of diabetes.

03:51.399 --> 03:55.303
Man! How much you need?

03:55.403 --> 03:56.570
Unfortunately,

03:57.838 --> 03:58.572
the lactose intolerance
epidemic killed that one.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.708
Oh, man,
a car dealership?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.343
Man, that is so cool.

04:02.443 --> 04:03.344
You should sell Ferraris.

04:04.312 --> 04:04.845
He'll have
to steal them first.

04:05.346 --> 04:05.979
A car dealership?

04:06.614 --> 04:07.681
All I see is a vacant lot.

04:07.781 --> 04:08.849
That's 'cause you got no vision.

04:09.917 --> 04:10.984
No, that's because
it's a vacant lot.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.587
Look, you know how people have
their cars repossessed, right?

04:14.788 --> 04:16.557
Well, you could buy those cars
at an auto auction for, like,

04:16.657 --> 04:17.658
three, $400,

04:17.758 --> 04:19.259
then sell them
for four times as much.

04:20.528 --> 04:22.563
Oh, man. Then we could use the
extra money to buy a new car.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.365
You know I don't
like loaning money.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.499
No, don't think of it as a loan.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.535
You're letting your money
work for you.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.003
Think of it
as getting your money a job.

04:30.103 --> 04:33.341
Looks like my dad's getting
a snow job.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.442
How much you need?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.610
Mama?

04:36.710 --> 04:37.745
Yes, baby?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.380
Can I take ballet?

04:39.480 --> 04:42.015
Ballet?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.884
Oh, baby.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.821
Oh. I've been waiting
for this day.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.957
My mother always wished
she had more talent.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.659
She dreamt of being in a band.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.027
* Do your dance,
do your dance *

04:54.127 --> 04:55.463
* Do your dance, quick

04:55.563 --> 04:57.731
* Mama, come on, baby

04:57.831 --> 04:59.600
* Tell me what's the word

04:59.700 --> 05:02.002
* Word up

05:02.102 --> 05:04.405
* Everybody say

05:04.505 --> 05:06.540
* When you hear they call you

05:06.640 --> 05:08.342
* You've got
to get it underway... *

05:09.777 --> 05:11.512
And since she couldn't do it,
Tonya was the next best thing.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.514
Oh, oh, hey,
let's see, let's see.

05:13.614 --> 05:16.517
Oh, we got to get you
some slippers and some tights

05:16.617 --> 05:18.986
and leotards, and you got
to have leg warmers

05:19.086 --> 05:21.755
and-and wristbands, and we got
to get you some lessons.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.958
And a stretching bar
and a wall full of mirrors...

05:25.058 --> 05:27.561
A Russian partner
and a platinum card.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.062
Deciding to go
to the dance was easy.

05:29.162 --> 05:31.399
Getting somebody
to go with me was a lot harder.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.933
Hey, Doc,
can I ask you a question?

05:33.033 --> 05:34.402
You just did.

05:35.636 --> 05:36.770
I'm just playing
with you, Chris.

05:36.870 --> 05:37.805
Now, what it is?

05:38.706 --> 05:39.407
I have to ask a girl
out to the dance.

05:40.408 --> 05:40.774
I was wondering
if you could give me some tips.

05:41.241 --> 05:42.009
Asking is easy.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.446
Not getting turned down--
that's the hard part.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.814
How do you not get turned down?

05:46.914 --> 05:49.683
The girl has to say yes.

05:49.783 --> 05:50.984
What makes them say yes?

05:51.084 --> 05:52.553
You never know.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.687
Yes, you do:

05:54.755 --> 05:55.689
money, fame, cars, jobs
and diamonds.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.025
But look, look, you got
to take your chances.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.928
If she says no,
ask somebody else.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.063
That's how I ended up
with my first wife.

06:03.163 --> 06:06.133
That's how
he ended up divorced.

06:08.436 --> 06:09.703
I decided to take Doc's advice

06:09.803 --> 06:11.572
and ask every girl
in the neighborhood.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.707
Sorry. I'm going
to Robert's school dance.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.609
Look, I kissed you.
It was a game.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.645
It's over.
Now leave me alone.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.012
Are you crazy?

06:19.112 --> 06:21.114
I'm not going
to Brooklyn Beach to no dance.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.716
It's all white people
over there!

06:22.816 --> 06:23.851
Dance?

06:23.951 --> 06:25.853
With you? Please.

06:25.953 --> 06:27.955
Quieres que corte?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.457
Mejore hechas
te paratras!

06:30.558 --> 06:31.725
Better move
to a bigger neighborhood.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.895
Meanwhile, Greg made
one small step for nerds,

06:34.995 --> 06:36.664
one giant step for nerd-kind.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.499
I got a date
to the dance.

06:38.599 --> 06:39.567
With who?

06:39.667 --> 06:41.802
Jennifer.
Doesn't she hate you?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.071
Well, she does,
but she also needs a math tutor.

06:44.171 --> 06:45.973
I told her I'd get her a B,

06:46.073 --> 06:48.876
and she agreed to walk in
with me and dance with me twice.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.744
In Greg's world,
that was second base.

06:50.844 --> 06:52.480
Wow. I asked just
about every girl

06:52.580 --> 06:54.482
in my neighborhood,
and they all said no.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.883
Well, why don't you just
ask somebody here?

06:55.983 --> 06:57.485
In all our time as friends,

06:58.952 --> 07:00.488
this is the closest I ever came
to punching Greg in the face.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.757
How am I gonna get a girl
from this school to go with me?

07:03.857 --> 07:04.925
Just ask somebody.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.927
I did. I asked Lisa,
Sydney, Darlene,

07:07.027 --> 07:08.161
and they all said no.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.930
I even asked Ms. Morello.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.834
Chris, I'm
flattered, but no.

07:13.934 --> 07:17.204
Where's Mary Kay Letourneau
when you need her?

07:17.304 --> 07:19.773
Would you ask her?

07:19.873 --> 07:21.141
Oh, excuse me?
Buzz off,
sidekick.

07:21.241 --> 07:22.476
I'm not the sidekick.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.677
He's the sidekick.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.178
Sorry, dude.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.949
Not to mention, lonely dude.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.788
CHRIS ROCK:
For me, the dance was over,

07:34.888 --> 07:36.724
but Greg was getting
the party started.

07:36.824 --> 07:40.994
Dude, I know who you can ask
to go to the dance with you.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.129
Who is she?

07:42.229 --> 07:43.897
Her name's Carrie.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.066
She's kind of quiet.
She slips under the radar.

07:46.166 --> 07:46.967
Like Al Qaeda.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.936
How long has she been
in our class?

07:49.036 --> 07:50.070
Since we got here.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.238
I had never paid much attention

07:52.205 --> 07:53.607
to her,
but when I thought back,

07:54.808 --> 07:56.810
she was there
when I first got to Corleone.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.679
Oh, yeah, now

07:58.779 --> 07:59.747
I remember her.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.749
How do you know
she's not going?

08:01.849 --> 08:03.183
Well, Jennifer told me.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.754
I mean, she wants to go,
just nobody's asked her yet,

08:06.854 --> 08:08.922
and she really doesn't care
who she goes with.

08:09.022 --> 08:10.558
No standards, no problem.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.494
Carrie?
Yeah.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.264
Hi. I'm Chris.
You're in
Ms. Morello's class.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.967
Yeah. I never really
noticed you before.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.902
That happens a lot.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.237
So, you going to the ninth grade
dance with anybody?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.939
No. You want to take me?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.608
So much
for the smooth approach.

08:27.708 --> 08:28.776
Yeah.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.077
Good.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.779
Call me.

08:31.879 --> 08:32.980
We'll talk about it.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.683
I wouldn't get a date
that easy again until...

08:36.884 --> 08:38.586
Actually, I never got a date
that easy again.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.187
Over at the auto auction,

08:40.287 --> 08:42.590
my uncle was bidding
to strike it rich.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.224
This is a very
solid vehicle.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.260
Only 17,000 miles,
originally sold for $12,000.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.929
We're going to start
the bidding off at $100.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.030
I'm looking for $100.

08:50.130 --> 08:51.131
I got $100.
I'll go for $150.

08:51.231 --> 08:51.999
$150. $150.

08:52.966 --> 08:53.300
Thank you very much.
$150. Looking for two.

08:54.034 --> 08:54.602
$200. $200. $200.
Give me $200.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.003
And I'm looking
for $250.

08:56.103 --> 08:56.970
$250. $250. $250.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.672
Thank you. $250.
Looking for three.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.273
I got $300. $300.
$300 right there...

09:01.008 --> 09:01.809
That guy wants
the same car.

09:02.409 --> 09:03.143
Don't worry.
I'll get it.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.311
$325 right over there.

09:04.411 --> 09:05.813
Thank you, sir.
$325, looking for $350.

09:05.913 --> 09:06.880
$350

09:06.980 --> 09:08.849
$350. Okay, $350.

09:08.949 --> 09:09.717
Four hundred!

09:09.817 --> 09:11.852
Do you mind?

09:11.952 --> 09:13.253
Sorry.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.055
$400 right here.

09:15.155 --> 09:16.590
$400. Looking
for $450.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.224
Anybody $450?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.727
$450. Holding up
$400. Going once.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.128
Holding $400 twice.

09:21.228 --> 09:21.962
Sold!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.133
Hey, you won an auction,
not The Price is Right.

09:28.268 --> 09:30.604
Okay, well, this looks
like everything.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.740
Yeah. slippers,
leg warmers, tights,

09:32.840 --> 09:36.043
hair band, leotard,
sweater, tutu,

09:36.143 --> 09:38.646
stretching bar and
mirrors for the wall.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.213
You spent a lot of money.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.915
Baby, when you are up there

09:42.015 --> 09:43.917
in your first performance
of Swan Lake,

09:44.017 --> 09:45.619
oh, it will all be worth it.

09:45.719 --> 09:49.790
So I guess that means
Swan Lake pays $92.87.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.760
So, now all we got to do
is sign you up for class.

09:52.860 --> 09:55.028
And help her develop
an eating disorder.

09:55.128 --> 09:56.063
Put this on.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.965
Oh, cute.
That is cute.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.833
Since I was going to the dance
with Carrie,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.969
I tried to get to know her
a little better.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.070
We did a little walking,

10:04.137 --> 10:04.905
a little talking
and a little eating.

10:05.706 --> 10:06.774
So, you've been here
the whole time,

10:06.874 --> 10:08.208
and you don't have
any friends?

10:08.308 --> 10:08.976
What are you, black?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.211
I don't like
that many people.

10:11.311 --> 10:12.946
I got the exact
opposite problem.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.114
Not too many people like me.

10:15.182 --> 10:15.783
While we were talking
about people,

10:16.583 --> 10:17.350
people were talking about us.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.252
:
Why would she go
with him?

10:19.352 --> 10:20.854
He's so dirty.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.224
I think he's blackmailing her,
and he's so ignorant.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.193
Anybody would be better
than him.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.697
He's so... sneaky.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.765
That was the nice way
of putting it.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.100
What they really meant was...

10:33.200 --> 10:34.902
:
What is she thinking?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.804
He's so black.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.706
Has she lost her mind?
He's black.

10:38.806 --> 10:41.742
Did somebody hit her in the head
with a baseball bat,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.211
poke her eyes out
and shoot her up with drugs?

10:44.311 --> 10:45.979
Doesn't she know
he's black?

10:46.079 --> 10:48.882
Talk about me going
to the dance with Carrie

10:48.982 --> 10:50.317
spread like wildfire,

10:50.417 --> 10:52.385
and the fire looked
something like this.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.858
Well, seems like
it's in pretty good shape,

10:57.958 --> 10:59.226
except for one thing.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.728
This car has been underwater.

11:00.828 --> 11:01.995
Underwater?

11:02.095 --> 11:05.132
Yup.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.133
Well, can you fix it?

11:06.233 --> 11:08.401
Yeah, but it's gonna cost you
about $900.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.071
DREW:
What
We could take

11:11.171 --> 11:12.205
the parts out and sell them

11:12.305 --> 11:14.007
and get more
than we bought it for.

11:14.107 --> 11:15.342
Did anybody ask you?

11:19.412 --> 11:21.749
I thought getting a date
to the dance would be

11:21.849 --> 11:25.152
the hard part, but having
a date made things even worse.

11:28.756 --> 11:31.291
Dude, I've heard what
people have been saying.

11:31.391 --> 11:32.425
This is ridiculous.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.761
They're treating you like...

11:34.828 --> 11:35.295
Like I'm going out
with a white girl?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.931
Hey, Pete, Linc.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.967
Where's Julie?
Funny.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.101
I know.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.269
Me and some of the kids

11:42.369 --> 11:43.470
chipped in and got
you something?

11:43.570 --> 11:45.272
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?

11:45.372 --> 11:48.441
Better than Mandingo.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.211
The kids at school
didn't want me to go

11:51.311 --> 11:53.280
to the dance with Carrie,
but I knew everyone

11:53.380 --> 11:54.948
at the barbershop
would support me.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.017
No, no! No!
You're going to the dance

11:57.117 --> 11:58.718
with a white girl?
RISKY:
Now, what's the big deal?

11:58.819 --> 12:00.353
He's going to the school dance,

12:00.453 --> 12:02.022
and it's with somebody
from the school.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.223
Thank you.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.958
Hey, Monk,
you ever dated a white girl?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.194
Nope. But I took a Vietnamese
girl to my prom.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.996
Vietnamese?
North or South?

12:09.096 --> 12:11.331
South.
ALL:
Ooh.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.500
Well, anyhow,
she spent the whole night

12:13.600 --> 12:14.802
hiding under the deejay booth.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.003
She was hiding from him.

12:16.103 --> 12:19.006
Well, I don't know
a lot about white women,

12:19.106 --> 12:20.507
but I know two things:

12:20.607 --> 12:23.443
when you perm their hair,
it gets curly, not straight;

12:23.543 --> 12:25.345
and when you invite one
to your after party,

12:25.445 --> 12:26.947
somebody's going to jail.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.381
And it ain't the white girl.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.083
Man, my uncle used
to always tell me,

12:30.183 --> 12:31.885
"If you see me
with a white girl,

12:31.985 --> 12:33.821
I'm holding her for the police."

12:33.921 --> 12:35.823
Nicole Richie
said the same thing.

12:41.428 --> 12:44.364
Hey, Carrie, can I talk
to you for a minute?
Sure.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.834
I've been thinking
about this dance.

12:46.934 --> 12:47.734
Me, too.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.369
I don't even know
what I'm gonna wear.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.104
What about you?
What are you wearing?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.774
Nothing. 'Cause I'm not going.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.877
When we come back,

12:56.977 --> 12:58.979
I'm gonna make matters worse
by hitting her

12:59.079 --> 13:01.181
with a bucket of blood.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.388
Oh, baby, I forgot
to tell you,

13:08.488 --> 13:10.190
Tonya's taking
ballet lessons.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.459
Ballet

13:12.559 --> 13:14.461
Too, too much.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.130
You're supposed to say,
"Oh, baby, that's great!

13:17.230 --> 13:18.131
Good luck!"

13:18.231 --> 13:20.233
Oh, baby, that's great.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.969
Good luck. How much?

13:22.069 --> 13:23.803
Not much, I just had to buy her

13:23.904 --> 13:25.272
an outfit
and a few other things.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.274
Well, what happened
with you and Ryan?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.342
Nothing.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.544
Hey, Ma, did Dad tell you
about the car that we bought

13:31.644 --> 13:32.880
that was dragged
out of the river?

13:32.980 --> 13:35.282
What?

13:38.451 --> 13:40.087
Note to self:
when doing wrong,

13:40.187 --> 13:42.422
leave Drew at home.

13:42.522 --> 13:43.823
So you bought a car?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.393
It's a long story.
No, it's not.

13:46.493 --> 13:50.163
All you had to do was say,
"Baby, I bought a car."

13:51.231 --> 13:52.265
Hey, man.

13:53.233 --> 13:53.833
Did you find a girl
to take to the dance?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
Yep.
Oh, that's great.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.570
Did you find an outfit to wear?

13:58.671 --> 13:59.039
Do you have something
in a white

13:59.139 --> 14:00.473
I'm not going.

14:00.573 --> 14:01.875
Why not?

14:01.975 --> 14:03.843
'Cause...

14:03.944 --> 14:05.845
no one wants to see me go
with a white girl.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.415
Not even blind people.

14:10.050 --> 14:11.952
Aren't you gonna say something?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.021
I guess, "Whew! That was
a close one"

14:14.121 --> 14:15.322
would be the wrong thing.

14:16.423 --> 14:18.458
Turns out I wasn't
the only one having

14:18.558 --> 14:20.327
second thoughts about dancing.

14:22.195 --> 14:23.430
Aren't you excited?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.933
I guess.

14:26.033 --> 14:27.334
Kind of nervous.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.070
Baby, this is what
we've been dreaming of.

14:30.170 --> 14:31.905
Don't be nervous.

14:32.005 --> 14:33.907
See, once you learn the moves,

14:34.007 --> 14:35.175
then you're gonna
have a recital,

14:35.275 --> 14:36.243
and then you're gonna be

14:37.110 --> 14:37.677
recruited by
the Dance Theater of Harlem

14:37.777 --> 14:39.212
or the New York City Ballet.

14:39.312 --> 14:40.880
And then you're gonna
move to Russia

14:40.981 --> 14:42.615
and change your name
to Svetlana.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.553
Ma, I don't want
to move to Russia.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.055
Can we go home?

14:49.256 --> 14:50.991
Oh, okay, I guess.

14:51.091 --> 14:52.559
I'll just tell your dad

14:52.659 --> 14:54.094
that we spent all
his hard-earned money

14:54.194 --> 14:55.495
for nothing.

14:55.595 --> 14:57.597
She pulled the same trick
when Tonya

14:57.697 --> 14:59.099
didn't want to finish college.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.500
Hey! How're you doing?

15:00.600 --> 15:01.901
Hello, ladies!

15:02.970 --> 15:03.503
I don't know what you're going
to do about this,

15:04.171 --> 15:04.637
but I need that money back.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.239
Oh, I'm already
ahead of you.

15:06.940 --> 15:07.941
What, you put $400 in my wallet?

15:08.675 --> 15:10.410
Don't worry, bro.
I got you.

15:10.510 --> 15:11.611
Where'd you get that?

15:11.711 --> 15:12.946
Sold the car to a dolphin.

15:13.880 --> 15:15.248
From my new business,
Ryan's Auto Parts.

15:15.348 --> 15:17.050
Drew was right.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.651
The car had water damage,

15:18.751 --> 15:20.387
but the parts were
in pretty good shape.

15:20.487 --> 15:22.322
So I scrapped it
and made 1,100 bucks.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.991
$1,100?
Here, Drew.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.159
50 bucks? Ah, cool!

15:26.259 --> 15:27.660
Hey, I'm going to head
down to the auction

15:27.760 --> 15:29.562
and see if I can find
another one. You in?

15:29.662 --> 15:30.663
You insane?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.232
You know, I think
I'm gonna give my money

15:32.765 --> 15:33.400
a few days off work.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.367
I'm in.

15:35.135 --> 15:35.935
Drew's money took my father's

15:36.669 --> 15:38.271
money's job and made $150.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.276
So that's it?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.978
You cancel on me?

15:45.078 --> 15:46.113
You quit talking to me

15:47.114 --> 15:47.547
and I'm just supposed
to be fine with that?

15:47.981 --> 15:48.648
Look, I'm sorry.

15:49.549 --> 15:50.450
People were saying
bad stuff about us.

15:51.318 --> 15:51.684
I didn't want to put you
through that.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.253
So I'm not going
to the dance

15:54.254 --> 15:56.456
because you can't take
a little name

15:56.556 --> 15:58.191
What happened
to "Bed"

15:58.291 --> 16:00.160
What's the worst
they can call you?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.595
Stymie, Buckwheat, Rochester,

16:02.695 --> 16:04.497
Grady, Rollo,

16:04.597 --> 16:06.699
Junior Mint, Bosco,

16:06.799 --> 16:08.568
Chim Chim, Shoe Sole,

16:08.668 --> 16:13.006
Lakeside, Skillet,
Count Chocula, Mudpie...?

16:13.106 --> 16:15.375
You done?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.446
Look, I was just trying
to look out for you.

16:19.546 --> 16:20.713
If you were looking out for me,

16:20.813 --> 16:22.515
we'd still be going
to the dance.

16:22.615 --> 16:25.152
You don't mind going
with a black guy?

16:25.252 --> 16:27.420
You're black?!

16:27.520 --> 16:28.688
Why didn't anyone tell me?

16:28.788 --> 16:30.090
What was I thinking?

16:31.291 --> 16:32.692
If you really didn't
want to go with me,

16:32.792 --> 16:34.594
all you had to do was say so.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.996
I don't even see why you asked.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.498
It's not so bad.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.000
A black girl would've
burned my house down.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.137
*

16:52.512 --> 16:55.148
Okay, ladies, that's
good for today.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.084
And Tonya, great job.

16:57.184 --> 16:58.618
You'll make a
wonderful ballerina.

16:58.718 --> 16:59.752
Thank you.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.488
See, honey?

17:01.588 --> 17:03.690
I told you you would be great.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.758
Yeah, but you also
threatened to slap

17:05.858 --> 17:08.228
the arch out of my foot
if I wasted Daddy's money.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.429
:
Don't say that too loud.

17:09.529 --> 17:13.032
The night of the dance,
I was all funked up.

17:15.602 --> 17:17.704
So you're sure you don't
want to go to that dance, huh?

17:17.804 --> 17:20.540
Yeah, that was a bad idea
from the start.

17:20.640 --> 17:24.111
And when I say "start,"
I mean coming here from Africa.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.412
Let me ask you something.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.680
You still want to go?

17:27.780 --> 17:29.516
Yeah, kind of.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.817
Then you should go.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.386
You can't let anybody stop you
from doing what you want to do.

17:33.486 --> 17:34.521
Yes, I can.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.123
But I thought you
didn't want me to go.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.191
Well, those were for my reasons.

17:38.291 --> 17:39.359
You need your own.

17:39.459 --> 17:40.593
And right now,
you don't have one.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.696
Well, I kind of wanted
to go with a date.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.398
You can go on a date anytime.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.800
Where's a laugh track
when you need it?

17:47.900 --> 17:50.737
But this is your
ninth grade dance.

17:50.837 --> 17:52.805
It's still the dance,
whether you have a date

17:52.905 --> 17:54.741
or not.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.144
You went to see
Rocky III by yourself.

17:57.244 --> 17:59.679
It was still Rocky III.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.283
Dad?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.684
Thanks.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.119
For what?

18:06.219 --> 18:07.354
For not going on for two hours
about how

18:07.454 --> 18:09.756
things are still the same even
if you do it by yourself.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.162
He came back two hours later
and did it anyway.

18:18.898 --> 18:21.301
Going to the ninth grade dance
by myself,

18:21.401 --> 18:22.702
I found out a couple of things.

18:22.802 --> 18:25.272
One, nobody expected
to see me there,

18:25.372 --> 18:27.174
and two, I didn't care.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.308
Hey, Beat Street.

18:29.376 --> 18:30.143
Got nobody to
Electric Boogaloo with?

18:30.710 --> 18:31.278
No, I'm here by myself.

18:32.212 --> 18:32.845
I guess that makes
two losers here tonight.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.814
Two?
Yeah.

18:34.914 --> 18:36.583
You and Teena Marie over there.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.856
Hey, man, you remember
Jennifer, right?

18:43.956 --> 18:44.891
Hey, Jennifer.

18:44.991 --> 18:46.159
I didn't say you could

18:46.259 --> 18:47.227
introduce me to people.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.462
The deal is we dance,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.731
I stand next to you,
you help me with my grade.

18:51.831 --> 18:54.501
You want to add things,
we have to talk about it.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.403
I'm just saying "hi"
to a friend.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.872
No, I saying "hi"
to your friend.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.741
Let's dance.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.611
I don't want this to last
any longer than it has to.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.380
I gotta go.

19:08.348 --> 19:10.383
After getting talked about,
put down,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.385
and hated like
it was my first day at school,

19:12.485 --> 19:14.354
I figured I might
as well get something

19:14.454 --> 19:15.722
out of going to that dance.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.790
What are you doing here?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.393
I wanted to come
to the dance, so I came.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.829
Yeah. Me, too.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.398
I'm sorry for canceling on you.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.401
Yeah, well... you did
what you had to do.

19:31.238 --> 19:33.240
So, you want to dance?

19:33.340 --> 19:35.308
Why would I want
to dance with you?

19:35.408 --> 19:39.246
'Cause it looks like
it's either me or nobody else.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.313
Yes.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.514
"Yes," what?

19:41.614 --> 19:43.350
I want to dance.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.353
You look nice.

19:46.453 --> 19:47.687
Shut up.
I'm still mad at you.

19:47.787 --> 19:48.921
Later that night, four guys

19:50.156 --> 19:51.258
still beat the crap out of me
in the bathroom,

19:52.459 --> 19:53.526
but if I hadn't gone
to my ninth grade dance,

19:54.327 --> 19:55.395
that never would have happened.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.874
Hey, Carrie, I'm going to lunch.
You want to come?

20:07.974 --> 20:10.777
No. I wanted to go to the dance.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.979
We went. I'm done.

20:13.079 --> 20:14.947
You need a friend,
talk to somebody else.

20:17.684 --> 20:20.287
Quit staring at me, bug eyes.

20:20.387 --> 20:23.456
* Everybody hates Chris.
