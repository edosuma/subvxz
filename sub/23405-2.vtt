WEBVTT

00:15.098 --> 00:17.517
- It's not much.
It's 25K.
- What is this?

00:17.600 --> 00:18.935
I dated it for
a couple days ago

00:19.018 --> 00:20.645
so it doesn't seem
like I wrote it

00:20.729 --> 00:21.855
just for this meeting.

00:21.938 --> 00:23.690
Sometimes with
these money guys--

00:23.773 --> 00:26.901
take it from a VC guy,
former VC guy--

00:26.985 --> 00:29.446
it helps to have
skin in the game.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.741
If it makes sense
in the mood of the room,

00:32.824 --> 00:35.535
pull it out, okay?

00:35.618 --> 00:38.913
What if this is one of those
Dennis Klein kind of things?

00:38.997 --> 00:40.582
Wouldn't that be funny?
( laughs )

00:40.665 --> 00:42.876
- ( laughs )
I know, right?
- Right?

00:46.421 --> 00:48.423
Hi.
Eric Neill.

00:48.506 --> 00:49.716
- Tom Davis.
- Good to meet you.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.843
- Hey, Tom.
- Olivia. Please.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.344
Thanks.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.852
Tom:
Michael, this is
a man named...

01:00.935 --> 01:02.896
- Eric Neill.
- Eric Neill.

01:02.979 --> 01:04.272
Please, have a seat.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.274
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

01:06.357 --> 01:10.987
Tom:
So, what is this
amazing pitch about?

01:11.070 --> 01:12.906
The idea is that
since you guys

01:12.989 --> 01:14.657
were the initial
investors,

01:14.741 --> 01:18.119
the seed angels,
of Mosaic,

01:18.203 --> 01:21.706
we thought we should
give you the first chance

01:21.790 --> 01:25.126
to get in
on the ground floor
of the expansion.

01:28.338 --> 01:32.592
Well,
your thoughts and points
are very well taken

01:32.675 --> 01:37.555
and we'll certainly
look into what we can
and cannot do.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.808
- We'll talk to our guys.
- Of course.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.312
You look like the cat
that ate the canary.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.357
( laughs )
It's just funny.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.818
Seriously.
What, 30 years?

01:49.901 --> 01:52.862
This is the least
I've ever seen you talk
in one sitting.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.572
( all laugh )

01:54.656 --> 01:57.909
Well, you know,
I've just-- I've taken
this really seriously

01:57.992 --> 02:00.745
and I don't want to blow it
by doing what I usually do,

02:00.829 --> 02:04.332
which is saying
one sentence too many

02:04.415 --> 02:08.044
or talking one minute
too long, so...

02:08.127 --> 02:10.338
( clicks tongue )

02:10.421 --> 02:13.258
Uh, are you both...?

02:13.341 --> 02:16.386
We've put in
25K to start.

02:16.469 --> 02:18.596
He-- he's put in,

02:18.680 --> 02:23.059
but, you know,
I'm considering
my options.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.644
Such as?

02:24.727 --> 02:27.981
Well, I mean,
we've all been in this
since the beginning,

02:28.064 --> 02:31.901
so, you know,
things that were...

02:31.985 --> 02:35.029
previously considered
immutable...

02:35.113 --> 02:38.032
You know, I have
to think about it, but...

02:38.116 --> 02:42.120
everything-- everything
is on the table.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.206
( sighs )

02:45.290 --> 02:46.791
Olivia:
<i>Changes.</i>

02:49.502 --> 02:52.130
- Joel:<i> What do you mean?</i>
- Happening.

02:53.506 --> 02:56.092
( sighs )
Not just the studio
per se,

02:56.175 --> 03:01.264
but the--
the whole place
in general.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.892
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I haven't really</i>
<i>thought it through.</i>

03:05.435 --> 03:06.895
<i>( sighs )</i>

03:06.978 --> 03:10.773
I just-- I don't
like dishonesty.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.234
That, I have
thought through.

03:13.318 --> 03:14.611
<i>Okay.</i>

03:16.738 --> 03:19.741
Just-- I find it
interesting

03:19.824 --> 03:22.952
that you never told me
about your little girlfriend.

03:24.078 --> 03:25.747
<i>The meadowlark.</i>

03:25.830 --> 03:27.749
What, Laura?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.083
<i>She's cute.</i>

03:29.167 --> 03:33.880
She's bubbly,
she's friendly.

03:33.963 --> 03:36.090
You know,

03:36.174 --> 03:37.717
I'm a big girl.

03:39.552 --> 03:41.679
I've been around.
I know the track.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.973
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I still don't understand.</i>

03:46.225 --> 03:50.146
Come on, you pretended
you were infatuated with me

03:50.229 --> 03:52.273
<i>when, really, you were</i>
<i>just infatuated</i>

03:52.357 --> 03:54.233
<i>with what you hoped</i>
<i>you would be,</i>

03:54.317 --> 03:57.570
and you saw me
as an avenue to get there.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.447
You know,
don't pretend

03:59.530 --> 04:02.575
that you weren't throwing me
all kinds of signals.

04:02.659 --> 04:04.786
( scoffs )
I mean...

04:04.869 --> 04:08.581
I admit I fell
for them, okay?

04:09.707 --> 04:11.542
But that was sneaky.

04:11.626 --> 04:13.544
You were sneaky.

04:15.588 --> 04:20.635
You're a sneaky,
sneaky boy, okay?

04:23.471 --> 04:25.598
Oh, whatever.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.141
<i>Oh.</i>

04:27.225 --> 04:28.810
<i>That's Eric.</i>

04:30.395 --> 04:33.022
He'll be moving
into the main house.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.275
You can help him
get those drawers inside.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.695
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.036
He is-- oof.

04:47.120 --> 04:51.332
Joel, come here
and meet Eric.

04:51.416 --> 04:53.501
Joel, come on.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.505
This is the guy
I told you about.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.215
- The boarder.
- Oh.

04:59.298 --> 05:02.802
Who is here to help you
as instructed.

05:04.053 --> 05:06.848
He is a sneaky,
sneaky boy.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.478
I really appreciate
your help with this.

05:12.562 --> 05:15.106
Yeah, sure.
Where do we drop it?

05:15.189 --> 05:18.026
Just down here
at the end of the hall, but...

05:18.109 --> 05:19.819
Yeah-- okay.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.572
( sighs )

05:26.367 --> 05:28.077
Oh, hey, Joel,

05:28.161 --> 05:30.163
that bench
at the end of the trail,

05:30.246 --> 05:32.331
it's, um, off-balance.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.542
Would you put
some of those, uh,

05:34.625 --> 05:36.836
un-off-balancers
under it?

05:36.919 --> 05:38.796
- Got it.
- Okay, thank you.

05:40.339 --> 05:42.592
The guy's got
an odd energy.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.969
Yeah, pound puppies,
you know.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.305
Never know when
they're gonna snap at you.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.603
You know, $25,000...

05:53.686 --> 05:56.230
I don't care
how much money you got,
that's incredibly generous.

05:56.314 --> 05:59.025
It's all good.
It's just money, right?

05:59.108 --> 06:01.069
You okay?

06:01.152 --> 06:02.779
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.032
Okay.

06:06.115 --> 06:07.909
Olivia:
<i>Who here goes to Pine Canyon</i>
<i>Elementary School,</i>

06:07.992 --> 06:09.410
<i>and who just</i>
<i>wet their pants?</i>

06:09.494 --> 06:11.704
<i>- ( gasps ) Oh!</i>
<i>- ( kids giggle )</i>

06:11.788 --> 06:13.664
Olivia:
<i>And who knows</i>
<i>what this story is about?</i>

06:13.748 --> 06:16.375
<i>( gasps ) Awesome!</i>
<i>That's so nice.</i>

06:16.459 --> 06:18.461
<i>All right, who wants</i>
<i>to do the spinning?</i>

06:18.544 --> 06:21.798
- Boy: Me!
- Oh, I think we'd better
let Miss Markel do it.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.966
Come on, let's let
teacher go first.

06:24.050 --> 06:25.760
Oh, teacher first.

06:25.843 --> 06:27.345
Teacher first.
Okay, great.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.515
Now, I want you
to be careful here
as we go by the workman.

06:32.058 --> 06:33.267
Okay, careful.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.811
Come on.
That's good.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.480
Now, stop on the rock
before here so that
she can spin.

06:37.563 --> 06:41.692
Even tall, stupid,
dorky, overgrown children
can come with us today.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.737
- What?!
Don't you laugh at that!
- ( kids laughing )

06:44.821 --> 06:47.698
- Guh!
- Olivia:<i> Now,</i>
<i>what's this story about?</i>

06:47.782 --> 06:49.867
-<i> What animal?</i>
- Kids: A bear!

06:49.951 --> 06:51.452
<i>That's right.</i>

06:51.536 --> 06:53.454
<i>Okay, now, if you know</i>
<i>what this is about...</i>

06:53.538 --> 06:55.498
- Hey, yeah.
-<i> ...don't be afraid</i>
<i>to read along...</i>

06:55.581 --> 06:58.459
- This is really
not a good time.
-<i> ( group reading )</i>

06:58.543 --> 07:00.711
I'll call you back.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.339
No, there's no ETA.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.049
The day after what?

07:05.133 --> 07:07.468
I can't say
I can hit that.

07:07.552 --> 07:10.763
This is not a good time.
I'll get you back.

07:10.847 --> 07:14.183
- Group:
..."the monster was blue."
- Olivia:<i> Great job.</i>

07:14.267 --> 07:16.227
<i>Now, who knows</i>
<i>what glimpsed means?</i>

07:16.310 --> 07:18.020
Olivia:
<i>You wouldn't believe</i>

07:18.104 --> 07:20.148
<i>the hoops we've had</i>
<i>to jump through.</i>

07:20.231 --> 07:22.358
<i>I mean, each state</i>
<i>has its own--</i>

07:22.441 --> 07:27.613
<i>well, Wyoming thinks</i>
<i>that charitable purposes</i>
<i>means one thing</i>

07:27.697 --> 07:31.742
<i>and Arizona something</i>
<i>entirely different.</i>

07:31.826 --> 07:34.328
<i>We thought we'd have</i>
<i>the paperwork done</i>
<i>by summer.</i>

07:34.412 --> 07:39.000
- We were being stu--
uh, optimistic.
- ( Olivia laughs )

07:39.083 --> 07:44.630
Well, in theory,
each spoke becomes a hub,

07:44.714 --> 07:49.510
<i>and then the hubs</i>
<i>kind of fan out</i>
<i>and, well...</i>

07:49.594 --> 07:55.558
<i>you know,</i>
<i>your son is brilliant.</i>

07:55.641 --> 07:58.102
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

07:58.186 --> 08:00.563
( glass clinking )

08:00.646 --> 08:01.939
- Olivia:<i> Uh-oh.</i>
- Eric:<i> Oh, God.</i>

08:02.023 --> 08:03.357
<i>( both laugh )</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:07.695
There's a Latin phrase:
<i>in vino, veritas.</i>

08:07.778 --> 08:13.034
It means
"in wine, truth."

08:13.117 --> 08:16.037
And I've had maybe
a glass and a half
too much vino,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.789
<i>so you'll forgive me</i>
<i>if there's perhaps</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:21.167
<i>a glass and a half</i>
<i>too much of veritas.</i>

08:21.250 --> 08:22.418
- Oh, my God.
- Mm.

08:22.501 --> 08:23.961
<i>Eric...</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:26.422
you scared
the hell out of me.

08:26.505 --> 08:29.759
At first.
Spooked me.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.929
Because she fell
hard fast.

08:33.012 --> 08:35.723
<i>Which I'm used to.</i>

08:35.806 --> 08:38.184
<i>But she's always had</i>
<i>this uncanny ability</i>

08:38.267 --> 08:42.647
to sprout-- whatever--
bat wings and then...

08:42.730 --> 08:46.776
- ( imitates wings flapping )
- ( laughter )

08:46.859 --> 08:49.570
I believe the phrase
"bat out of hell" was coined

08:49.654 --> 08:53.616
to describe
your relationship
to relationships.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.788
Hence my always available
tub of Double Fudge Chunk.

09:00.539 --> 09:03.834
But I think this will be
the first tub I finish myself.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.966
'Cause for the first time
in 24 years,

09:10.049 --> 09:11.842
no evidence of wings.

09:13.970 --> 09:18.140
So, those arms of yours
had better fucking be strong

09:18.224 --> 09:21.852
and open
and available.

09:24.772 --> 09:26.565
Wow...

09:26.649 --> 09:29.277
maybe it was
two and a half glasses
too much vino.

09:29.360 --> 09:30.945
- ( laughter )
- Apologies.

09:31.028 --> 09:33.030
Oh, I loved it.

09:36.158 --> 09:39.370
Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, thank you, darling.

09:39.453 --> 09:42.290
- Here we go.
- Hey, man. Oh!

09:42.373 --> 09:45.001
One of those on the fire.
Just dump the rest right there.

09:45.084 --> 09:46.460
Let's keep it warm.

09:46.544 --> 09:48.379
- ( grunts )
- Thank you.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.923
Hold on a sec.
Um...

09:52.967 --> 09:54.385
Uh, eh, you know what?

09:54.468 --> 09:56.470
- Merry Christmas.
- What?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.055
Yeah, you work
your ass off around here.

09:58.139 --> 09:59.515
Thanks, man.
Holy shit.

09:59.598 --> 10:02.143
Hey, we're just about
to have a toast.

10:02.226 --> 10:04.145
- You want a drink?
- Oh, yeah.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.647
Hey, not too much.
He's driving.

10:06.731 --> 10:08.733
Joel:
<i>One drink's not gonna</i>
<i>make a difference.</i>

10:08.816 --> 10:10.234
I'm from Minnesota.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.820
JC:
<i>I think I know</i>
<i>what that means.</i>

10:12.903 --> 10:14.405
I'm sure you do.

10:14.488 --> 10:17.116
Just don't let
the Hulk out.

10:26.083 --> 10:27.793
<i>( phone buzzing )</i>

10:30.671 --> 10:32.757
Yeah, what?

10:32.840 --> 10:36.260
Oh, yeah, sorry,
it's been a crazy time.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.057
Yeah, well,
it's 2:00 a.m. here.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.309
This was your
drop-dead date,
not mine.

10:43.392 --> 10:46.145
I told you it would take
as long as it takes.

10:47.646 --> 10:49.607
I can't answer that.

10:49.690 --> 10:52.193
Because I just can't.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.862
I gotta go.
I can't do this.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.281
I can't answer that.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.075
Because it's complicated.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.802
( moans )
Who was on the phone?

11:19.178 --> 11:21.138
A voice from the past.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.808
Ugh.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.684
I hate those.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.505
Mr. Eric, she's here!

11:54.588 --> 11:56.298
<i>Gracias.</i>

11:56.382 --> 11:59.093
- Olivia:<i> Hi, Graciella.</i>
-<i> Hi. How are you?</i>

11:59.176 --> 12:00.594
Olivia:
<i>Hi. Good.</i>
<i>How was your day?</i>

12:00.678 --> 12:03.472
<i>It was pretty good.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

12:03.556 --> 12:06.350
<i>What's with the candles</i>
<i>on the floor?</i>

12:06.434 --> 12:09.812
<i>Ah, maybe you find out.</i>

12:09.895 --> 12:11.439
<i>Maybe I find out.</i>

12:11.522 --> 12:13.149
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

12:14.859 --> 12:18.112
- ( laughs )
What's going--
- Eric:<i> Hey.</i>

12:21.449 --> 12:23.576
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:29.582
( laughs )
Oh...

12:34.128 --> 12:35.546
You, uh--

12:38.674 --> 12:40.384
you wanna get married?

12:48.976 --> 12:50.561
Uh...

12:52.771 --> 12:54.523
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

12:56.442 --> 12:58.068
- All right.
- Yeah.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.778
<i>( chatter )</i>

12:59.862 --> 13:02.615
<i>( music playing )</i>

13:07.411 --> 13:09.455
Hey!
How you doing?

13:09.538 --> 13:10.664
Happy New Year.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.000
I'm assuming you have
good news for me.

13:13.083 --> 13:16.629
Well, I have big news.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.672
It's over.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.966
Olivia and I are engaged.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.179
Wait, I'm--
I'm sorry?

13:25.262 --> 13:26.805
It's over.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.099
<i>We're engaged</i>
<i>to be married.</i>

13:32.394 --> 13:33.812
Is this a joke?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.106
No, it is not.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.403
We had an agreement.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.322
You don't just
get to decide this.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.574
Things changed.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.202
So here's
the remaining money,

13:48.285 --> 13:50.454
<i>a little over 53K.</i>

13:51.997 --> 13:54.875
<i>It'll more than cover</i>
<i>your flight.</i>

13:54.959 --> 13:56.418
What am I supposed
to do with this?

13:56.502 --> 14:00.047
Keep it, give it
to your client,
I don't care.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.924
You don't understand.
You're not alone in this.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.677
Hey, I flew here.
I fuckin' flew here
because--

14:04.760 --> 14:07.054
Because apparently
you don't get your fee,

14:07.137 --> 14:09.682
whatever the fuck that is,
until I deliver.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.433
Well, I'm not going
to deliver,

14:11.517 --> 14:14.853
<i>so this is as whole</i>
<i>as you're ever gonna get.</i>

14:14.937 --> 14:16.772
<i>What you do with it</i>
<i>is up to you.</i>

14:19.942 --> 14:21.360
Is this real?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.571
It is.

14:23.654 --> 14:26.699
Huh, till she finds out
the truth

14:26.782 --> 14:28.367
about how it all started.

14:29.827 --> 14:31.579
We'll find out
in about six hours

14:31.662 --> 14:33.956
because I'm telling her
tonight.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.457
<i>About everything.</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:37.167
<i>If you're saying</i>
<i>you would like me</i>

14:37.251 --> 14:39.753
<i>to include you</i>
<i>in that story,</i>
<i>I'm happy to.</i>

14:39.837 --> 14:41.630
Otherwise,
this is the last

14:41.714 --> 14:44.758
you and I
will ever communicate
about anything.

14:44.842 --> 14:45.718
Are we clear?

15:05.613 --> 15:08.907
-<i> ( muffled music playing )</i>
- ( sighs )

15:13.537 --> 15:16.332
- ( chatter )
-<i> ( music continues )</i>

15:16.415 --> 15:18.042
Woman:
<i>Whoo!</i>

15:18.125 --> 15:19.835
Hey, hi.
Good to see you.

15:19.918 --> 15:22.796
- Bruce, hi.
How are you, honey?
- Hey, good to see you.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.174
- So good to see you.
How's Nick?
-<i> Good.</i>

15:25.257 --> 15:27.343
Good? Good.
Hi, hi.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.345
Hi!

15:29.428 --> 15:33.140
- Happy New Year!
- Guests: Happy New Year!

15:33.223 --> 15:35.184
- Hi. How are you guys doing?
- Man:<i> Great.</i>

15:35.267 --> 15:37.019
- How's the business?
-<i> It's doing great.</i>

15:37.102 --> 15:38.604
Is it?
Good. Hi.

15:38.687 --> 15:40.606
-<i> Great party.</i>
- Thank you.

15:40.689 --> 15:43.317
You guys having fun?
Shelly, hi.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.695
It's nice to see you.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.615
- Marla, hi.
- Oh, my gosh,
this party's so fabulous.

15:49.698 --> 15:51.325
- Thank you so much.
- Mwah. Good.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.494
- Hi, Brian.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

15:53.577 --> 15:56.955
You two--
I figured I'd find you
with two men in the corner...

15:57.039 --> 15:58.832
as usual.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.250
Hi, everybody.
You having fun?

16:00.334 --> 16:02.378
- Woman #2:<i> Hi!</i>
- Everything good?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.213
-<i> Yes, great!</i>
- Woman #3:<i> It's great.</i>
<i>The food's good.</i>

16:04.296 --> 16:06.340
- Is it? Good.
Did you eat?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

16:06.423 --> 16:09.176
He's so cute, you know?
That's Betty's kid.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.304
And he's just been great.
He's so lovely.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.015
( music and chatter
continue )

16:17.726 --> 16:20.229
- Oh, I screwed it up.
- You did. Do you want me
to make a shot for you?

16:20.312 --> 16:21.897
- Yes, please.
- All right.

16:21.980 --> 16:25.025
- Woman:<i> Whoo!</i>
- All: Oh!

16:25.109 --> 16:26.944
- I tried.
- I know. I still
love you, though.

16:27.027 --> 16:28.529
- Olivia, hi.
- Happy New Year.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.698
Hey, Chris and Arden Clarke
from down the hill.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.117
We met you at the hay ride,
and you invited us
to stop by.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.993
- Yeah, thanks for coming!
- Thank you.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.871
- Okay.
- Sorry, we were told
that you never do this,

16:37.955 --> 16:40.082
but our daughter Stella
would kill us

16:40.165 --> 16:41.583
if we don't at least ask.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.378
Okay.
Human or bear?

16:44.461 --> 16:46.922
- Uh, I think a bear.
- Bear?

16:47.005 --> 16:48.298
Bear for Stella,
okay.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.008
I gotta go get
that stuff and I'll...

16:50.092 --> 16:51.844
- Thank you.
- Okay.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.099
Hey, psst.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.934
Can you get him
to cover for you

16:59.017 --> 17:00.853
- so we can...?
- Yeah, sure.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.521
- Kevin, you good?
- Yeah, man.

17:02.604 --> 17:04.481
Just wanna talk to you
for a sec.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.445
What's up?

17:12.489 --> 17:14.408
I need to come clean
about a few things.

17:14.491 --> 17:16.702
Honestly,
one of them

17:16.785 --> 17:20.080
is why you're here
to begin with.

17:20.164 --> 17:22.124
- Okay.
- All right, the theme
of this conversation

17:22.207 --> 17:24.460
is moving forward,
not back.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.462
Just...

17:26.545 --> 17:29.548
I think we should both
look forward only, okay?

17:30.966 --> 17:32.885
All right,
I'm gonna sell this place.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.636
I'm gonna
let it go.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.639
All of the dreams
that I had for it
and myself are over,

17:37.723 --> 17:40.976
and I think that you
should do the same, okay?

17:41.059 --> 17:43.061
I'm not sure I'm quite
getting what you're saying.

17:43.145 --> 17:45.606
Yeah, 'cause I'm not
really saying it.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.110
It's not really gonna
happen for you, Joel.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.362
I'm sorry?

17:53.739 --> 17:55.574
Your work, it's...

17:58.243 --> 18:00.454
it's nice,
it's-- it's good.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.372
It's--
it's proficient.

18:02.456 --> 18:04.541
I wish there was
really more under it,

18:04.625 --> 18:06.251
but there isn't,

18:06.335 --> 18:08.212
and I don't really
think there's...

18:09.546 --> 18:11.465
ever gonna be.

18:11.548 --> 18:13.133
Are you cool
with this?

18:14.885 --> 18:16.220
Okay, go on.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.014
( sighs )

18:24.269 --> 18:27.105
( exhales )

18:27.189 --> 18:29.817
There really is
nowhere else to go
with this.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.111
I mean, I think that's
really where we're at.

18:33.195 --> 18:34.363
Okay?

18:35.572 --> 18:36.865
You've hit
a wall, Joel,

18:36.949 --> 18:40.327
and there really is
only two ways to go.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.663
I mean,
up and over it,

18:42.746 --> 18:46.792
which I don't really think
is gonna happen,

18:46.875 --> 18:50.879
or back

18:50.963 --> 18:52.422
and the other way.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.883
Why have I
been here, then?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.426
( laughing )

18:58.053 --> 18:59.513
I mean...

19:03.809 --> 19:06.728
Because
you were handsome,

19:06.812 --> 19:10.107
and I was afraid
of getting old.

19:10.190 --> 19:14.027
I am afraid
of getting old,

19:14.111 --> 19:17.239
and you
looked at me

19:17.322 --> 19:20.617
like I was the thing

19:20.701 --> 19:24.705
that I was so desperately
trying to recapture.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.501
And I appreciate that.

19:31.837 --> 19:35.090
But if we're
honest, here...

19:35.173 --> 19:40.304
I don't think that
that ever really existed,
did it?

19:40.387 --> 19:43.891
So, I think we should both
just square up the rent...

19:45.183 --> 19:47.227
- and move forward.
- Wait, what?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.396
The-- the rent
that I deferred,

19:49.479 --> 19:50.898
the $1,500 lease.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.691
What are you
talking about?

19:52.774 --> 19:54.234
( sighs )

19:54.318 --> 19:57.863
Look, I don't wanna owe you,
I don't want you to owe me.

19:57.946 --> 20:00.782
- I was working
in exchange for the rent.
- I think it's clearer that way.

20:00.866 --> 20:05.412
No, the rent was less
because you were working.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.497
I got $3,000

20:07.581 --> 20:09.958
- from the last
tenant I had over there.
- What are you talking about?

20:11.209 --> 20:14.963
Did you not read
the contract?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.965
- I cleaned out
your septic tank...
- Did you just sign it

20:17.049 --> 20:18.759
- without even reading it?
- ...in the rains in October.

20:18.842 --> 20:20.302
- I know.
- I was knee-deep
in your shit.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.888
- I am aware of your work.
- You lied to me!

20:22.971 --> 20:25.307
- No, I'm not paying you
money that I don't owe you.
- You should go back there.

20:25.390 --> 20:27.476
- You should
look at the contract.
- Don't fucking patronize me!

20:27.559 --> 20:30.604
Look into your heart
and decide what you think
that you should pay.

20:30.687 --> 20:33.440
You are a manipulative,
selfish, narcissistic liar.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.943
- Well, that may be true, Joel.
- You're only moving on

20:36.026 --> 20:38.111
- because you
failed at everything.
- You should read the contract.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.280
And you're trying
to rationalize it by saying
that giving up is moving on.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.116
Now you want me to give up, too,
just so you can feel better
about yourself?!

20:43.200 --> 20:45.077
- If you want to.
- No. Oh, fuck you!

20:45.160 --> 20:48.330
- Fuck you!
Happy fucking New Year!
- Fine! Fine! Ooh.

20:48.413 --> 20:50.707
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Hoo.

20:52.793 --> 20:55.629
- ( sighs )
- Hey.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.339
Hey.
Uh...

20:57.422 --> 20:59.967
Well, that happened.

21:00.050 --> 21:03.512
Uh... I-- do--
are you...

21:03.595 --> 21:05.138
Can you-- are you
available to, uh...

21:05.222 --> 21:08.350
- I would love...
- ...to talk?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.018
...to talk to you.

21:10.102 --> 21:12.270
Okay.
All right.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.981
- Okay.
- Oh.

21:14.064 --> 21:18.318
Yeah, I gotta go get
some paper and stuff
for those people.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.071
- They want a bear.
- Okay. Okay.

21:21.154 --> 21:23.031
All right.
Well, then I'll just come--

21:23.115 --> 21:25.367
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.743
I thought
we weren't drinking.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.996
We said in the new year,
which is tomorrow.

21:29.079 --> 21:30.831
I just-- I don't
wanna go there.

21:30.914 --> 21:32.833
Go there?
What-- go where?

21:32.916 --> 21:35.877
Now I have
two people telling me
that I'm in a sinkhole?

21:35.961 --> 21:37.212
I didn't say that!

21:37.295 --> 21:39.047
Is-- is that
what she said to you?

21:39.131 --> 21:40.674
<i>Oh, that I'm</i>
<i>in a sinkhole</i>

21:40.757 --> 21:42.718
<i>and that I owe her</i>
<i>eight months' rent.</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:44.219
<i>And, oh, yeah,</i>
<i>what was the other thing?</i>

21:44.302 --> 21:47.389
That I don't have
a fucking shred of talent!

21:47.472 --> 21:49.474
God! Come on,
have some.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.893
Joel, Joel,
you're kind of scaring me.

21:51.977 --> 21:53.353
Joel, don't pour
that for me.

21:53.437 --> 21:55.022
Let's just go
to Nate and Melissa's--

21:55.105 --> 21:57.024
What, and have milk
and fucking cookies?

21:57.107 --> 21:59.693
I'm 28 fucking
years old, Laura.

21:59.776 --> 22:03.363
And Olivia Lake
is a fucking bitch!

22:03.447 --> 22:06.742
( panting )

22:06.825 --> 22:08.452
Okay, Joel.

22:12.039 --> 22:13.540
I'm gonna go.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.585
I'll see you
at brunch tomorrow--

22:16.668 --> 22:19.212
Yeah, I look forward
to it!

22:19.296 --> 22:21.131
Happy New Year.

22:26.303 --> 22:28.346
<i>( glass clinking )</i>

22:28.430 --> 22:29.598
Eric:<i> Okay.</i>

22:29.681 --> 22:34.853
Um... this discussion,
what I'm gonna say

22:34.936 --> 22:37.147
is utter,
rock-bottom truth.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.440
Okay.

22:40.233 --> 22:43.820
W-what you've done
for me

22:43.904 --> 22:47.532
has never happened
to me before, okay?

22:47.616 --> 22:50.577
You've changed me
to my core,

22:50.660 --> 22:53.121
and I-- I love you.

22:53.205 --> 22:57.501
I really, genuinely
am in love with you.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.421
Given that you've
already proposed,

23:01.505 --> 23:03.965
I just don't
see this as news.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.885
- ( both laugh )
- Okay, yeah.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.554
Okay, okay.

23:10.806 --> 23:12.474
Fair enough, um...

23:15.143 --> 23:16.770
What I feel for you--

23:16.853 --> 23:19.189
I'm sorry,
I know this is
all over the map.

23:21.983 --> 23:26.613
What I feel for you
is so real

23:26.696 --> 23:29.116
that I wanna
start with that.

23:29.199 --> 23:32.494
Do you, uh,
believe that?

23:33.829 --> 23:35.413
Yeah.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.124
- Okay.
- Yeah, I do.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.626
Okay.

23:41.086 --> 23:44.464
The next few things
I'm gonna say

23:44.548 --> 23:47.551
are gonna be hard.

23:49.136 --> 23:53.640
All I ask is that
you wait tight,

23:53.723 --> 23:55.809
I-- I get it
all out.

24:05.443 --> 24:06.945
( no audible dialogue )

24:10.115 --> 24:12.742
( no audible dialogue )

24:14.661 --> 24:16.204
( whispers )
Dennis Klein.

24:19.916 --> 24:21.209
What?

24:24.171 --> 24:25.589
Dennis Klein.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.302
What about
Dennis Klein?

24:30.385 --> 24:32.554
He was fake.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.639
What? No.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.725
Eric.

24:36.808 --> 24:40.896
Please, let me--
I gotta go through
the whole thing in order.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.691
I said to JC,

24:44.774 --> 24:49.446
I joked, you know,
that Dennis Klein was
a hell of a wingman.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.034
But it wasn't
a joke, was it?

24:55.827 --> 24:58.788
Everything that we have
right now is real.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.332
Really?

25:02.709 --> 25:05.253
Is it real?

25:05.337 --> 25:08.298
What's real?
I mean, are you--
are you real?

25:08.381 --> 25:12.719
Please let me just
do this in order, okay?

25:12.802 --> 25:16.640
So you can just take me
through the tube?

25:18.016 --> 25:19.142
I don't understand.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.145
Just ride me
like a surfer.

25:22.229 --> 25:25.857
- Just manage my fears.
- Oh.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.735
O-okay,
I've always said
you're perceptive,

25:28.818 --> 25:31.613
but, no, I just--
I just wanna do this
in the right--

25:31.696 --> 25:34.991
Well, this is no longer
your conversation, Michael.

25:35.075 --> 25:36.910
Michael, oh.

25:36.993 --> 25:41.790
Oh, the--
the $25,000 check, it's...

25:43.375 --> 25:44.960
Oh, I joked.
I said,

25:45.043 --> 25:46.670
"Oh, what if this
is like Dennis Klein?"

25:46.753 --> 25:50.632
And you-- you said,
"Oh, I know," and then
you laughed.

25:51.841 --> 25:53.468
You laughed!

25:53.551 --> 25:54.844
Oh, you...

25:57.639 --> 26:00.141
( crying )
What is his real name?!

26:00.225 --> 26:02.811
- Please stop.
- What is Dennis Klein's
real name?

26:02.894 --> 26:06.064
His real name
is Casey Delacroix.

26:06.147 --> 26:08.692
I did something really dumb,
but in a way it wasn't

26:08.775 --> 26:10.527
'cause that's how
I got to meet you.

26:10.610 --> 26:12.487
And I ended everything
that brought me to this point.

26:12.570 --> 26:13.989
That's what
you need to know now.

26:15.407 --> 26:19.577
( crying )
I thought you fell
from the sky.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.705
I'm a fucking idiot.

26:21.788 --> 26:24.708
But-- but, actually,
I'm the one who had
the lucky basket.

26:24.791 --> 26:26.918
See?
I'm the one...

26:28.420 --> 26:30.672
Oh, you're a missile.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.466
You're a targeted
missile.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.177
Who sent you here?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.054
- Who sent you here?
How did you get here?
- Okay.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.597
- I got a phone call.
- When was it?

26:39.681 --> 26:41.182
Who did it?
Who did this to me?

26:41.266 --> 26:42.934
I got a phone call
by someone

26:43.018 --> 26:45.353
who knew someone
who wanted to buy
your land--

26:45.437 --> 26:46.813
a lawyer.

26:48.023 --> 26:50.650
We met because
of a fucking lawyer?

26:50.734 --> 26:52.319
I bailed on it, though.
It's gone!

26:52.402 --> 26:54.321
I'm telling you
it's 100% gone.

26:54.404 --> 26:58.658
Okay, yes,
I was hired to pretend
to be an investor

26:58.742 --> 27:01.828
- because that seemed like a way
to get you interested in me.
- ( crying )

27:01.911 --> 27:03.872
But, no, no, no, no.
But it's over.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.708
- It's all over.
- ( sobs ) I don't know
what's happening.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.626
No. No, no,
it's over.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.046
I'm still
the same person.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.964
I don't even know
who you are!

27:13.048 --> 27:14.507
I'm Eric!
I'm still Eric!

27:14.591 --> 27:16.343
I don't even know
if that's your fucking name!

27:16.426 --> 27:18.386
It's my name.
I swear to God,
it's my name.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.013
- Who the fuck are you?
- I'm the same person.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.890
Where the fuck
did you come from?

27:21.973 --> 27:23.850
What the fuck
are you doing here?!

27:23.933 --> 27:25.810
- Listen,
if you need some time--
- I want you to take your shit

27:25.894 --> 27:27.812
- and I want you to get
the fuck out of my house!
- No, no, no!

27:27.896 --> 27:29.689
- I want you to get
the fuck out of here!
- No, I love you!

27:29.773 --> 27:31.358
- Get the fuck out--
- I love you!

27:31.441 --> 27:33.026
- It's all real.
- How the fuck can you
say that?

27:33.109 --> 27:35.278
- I do. No, no, no.
- Who does this to people?

27:35.362 --> 27:37.405
No. No, Olivia.

27:37.489 --> 27:39.657
- How could you
fucking do this to me?
- I don't know. I'm sorry!

27:39.741 --> 27:42.285
- I want you to--
to get your shit.
- No, I love you.

27:42.369 --> 27:45.580
- And I want you to get
the fuck out of my house.
- You need some time.

27:45.663 --> 27:47.999
- You just need some time.
- I was in love with you.

27:48.083 --> 27:49.959
- I love you.
- I loved you.

27:50.043 --> 27:51.378
- Don't you understand?
- I do.

27:51.461 --> 27:53.338
- You get your shit!
- No. No, no, no, no.

27:53.421 --> 27:56.299
- You get the fuck
out of my house!
- No, no, you just--

27:56.383 --> 27:58.968
- you need some time, okay?
- Just get the fuck
away from me!

27:59.052 --> 28:02.305
Get away from me!
Get away from me!

28:22.325 --> 28:25.120
( sobbing )

28:57.902 --> 28:59.988
It was you,
wasn't it?

29:01.739 --> 29:03.950
Eric Neill.

29:04.033 --> 29:06.744
You are not
coming back here.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.916
I am calling
you-know-who,

29:12.000 --> 29:14.711
and I'm gonna
fucking bury you.

29:19.883 --> 29:23.219
Don't you dare
come back here,
and I am done.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.638
I'm done talking to you.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.727
- ( groans )
-<i> ( line ringing )</i>

29:30.810 --> 29:32.437
- ( sniffles )
- JC's voice:<i> If you can't</i>
<i>say it to my face...</i>

29:32.520 --> 29:35.398
- Oh, shit.
-<i> ...leave me a message.</i>

29:36.983 --> 29:39.319
Oh, JC,
when you call in
for this,

29:39.402 --> 29:43.156
I hope it costs you,
like, eight million pesos

29:43.239 --> 29:47.660
or whatever the fuck
the currency is in Ibiza.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.287
Ibiza.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.247
Oh, shit.

29:51.331 --> 29:52.832
( chuckles )

29:52.916 --> 29:56.127
I am such
a fucking idiot.

29:56.211 --> 30:01.341
I mean,
my choices in men

30:01.424 --> 30:06.304
including
and specifically you

30:06.387 --> 30:08.264
in this moment.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.225
I cannot believe

30:10.308 --> 30:13.311
that I let you go away

30:13.394 --> 30:17.023
this one New Year's Eve.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.235
I mean, you should know me
well enough by now

30:20.318 --> 30:22.153
to know that
I didn't mean it.

30:22.237 --> 30:24.030
( chuckles )

30:26.282 --> 30:28.201
( sniffles )
I lost my train.

30:28.284 --> 30:31.287
Uh... men, yeah.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.830
( scoffs )

30:32.914 --> 30:34.624
Men, yeah.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.084
You know?

30:37.544 --> 30:39.254
Every goddamn one of them

30:39.337 --> 30:41.422
that I invite
into my house

30:41.506 --> 30:43.883
are just a bunch
of fucking...

30:45.677 --> 30:48.096
liars
and con men and...

30:49.389 --> 30:51.224
fucking violent.

30:51.307 --> 30:53.935
I mean,
one of them tonight,

30:54.018 --> 30:59.232
he just fucking had
his fist, like, right up

30:59.315 --> 31:03.236
and was just screaming
and spitting

31:03.319 --> 31:06.614
and his nostrils flaring

31:06.698 --> 31:09.534
and his jaw all clenched.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.578
And, I mean,
honest to God,

31:11.661 --> 31:13.830
I just thought
it was like...

31:13.913 --> 31:15.915
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

31:15.999 --> 31:18.960
Oh, my fucking God.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.670
Look who's back.

31:21.879 --> 31:24.424
Ugh, fuck.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.024
- Hi.
- Hey.

31:41.107 --> 31:42.609
So there's still
no body?

31:42.692 --> 31:45.111
No, but it's pretty bad
in there.

31:45.194 --> 31:46.571
- Okay.
- Yeah.

31:46.654 --> 31:49.324
- Nate: Okay.
- Get prepared.

31:49.407 --> 31:51.326
- Let's go have a look.
- Melissa: Okay.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.202
<i>( chatter )</i>

32:07.800 --> 32:09.469
Yeah.

32:09.552 --> 32:11.262
So, yeah.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.558
Someone tried to clean this up
and then thought better of it.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.143
Mm-hmm.

32:17.226 --> 32:18.394
Oh, boy.

32:19.854 --> 32:22.148
- Who found this?
- That's the thing.

32:22.231 --> 32:24.651
Graciella--
she's the housekeeper-- called

32:24.734 --> 32:27.111
and I asked her
who discovered the scene.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.238
And at first,
she said she did,

32:29.322 --> 32:31.074
but then
I asked again.

32:31.157 --> 32:33.618
It was actually
the gardener who found it.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.163
Horacio Romero.

32:37.246 --> 32:40.124
Well, why didn't
he call this in himself?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.834
I don't know.

32:41.918 --> 32:44.087
- Nate?
- Yeah?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.888
- Nate:<i> You wanna</i>
<i>take a picture?</i>
- Woman:<i> I'm trying.</i>

32:53.971 --> 32:55.640
<i>( woman speaking Spanish )</i>

33:00.353 --> 33:03.272
<i>( Horacio speaking Spanish )</i>

33:40.685 --> 33:42.437
<i>( vehicle approaching )</i>

33:56.284 --> 33:57.744
Nate:
<i>These are only</i>
<i>a few questions.</i>

33:57.827 --> 33:59.078
<i>They're not</i>
<i>gonna take very long.</i>

33:59.162 --> 34:00.329
<i>( woman translating )</i>

34:00.413 --> 34:02.039
I apologize
for the inconvenience.

34:05.042 --> 34:07.837
Do you think maybe--
bambinos--

34:07.920 --> 34:09.547
do you think
you maybe could, um--

34:09.630 --> 34:11.632
- could get out of the room?
- ( speaking Spanish )

34:11.716 --> 34:14.927
No. No, it's--
it's just this might be
a little bit difficult for them.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.721
- This is a sensitive issue.
- Oh,<i> sí, sí.</i>

34:16.804 --> 34:19.098
( speaking Spanish )

34:19.182 --> 34:21.142
- Thank--<i> muchas gracias.</i>
-<i> ( phone buzzing )</i>

34:21.225 --> 34:22.351
Thank--
thank you. Oh.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.395
One moment.
This is my boss.

34:24.479 --> 34:25.438
Hey, Alan.

34:25.521 --> 34:27.273
Yes, it's me.
I'm here.

34:28.566 --> 34:29.942
Yeah, well,
to be honest--

34:30.026 --> 34:31.360
even so...

34:32.737 --> 34:34.280
I don't think
the prints are real.

34:34.363 --> 34:36.032
What do you mean
they're not real?

34:36.115 --> 34:38.284
They're footprints
in blood

34:38.367 --> 34:41.621
from boots that belong
to the very person you're
speaking with,

34:41.704 --> 34:43.998
so take him in now.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.875
- Sir? Hi, Alan.
- Yeah.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.001
Two things.

34:47.085 --> 34:49.295
One-- forensics
just confirmed

34:49.378 --> 34:53.257
only 20 to 30 pounds
of pressure on those
boot prints.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.052
They were faked,
probably by hand.

34:56.135 --> 34:59.305
- The gardener was framed.
- As Nate suspected.

34:59.388 --> 35:02.183
Two-- this is Mr. Clarke.
He's a neighbor.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.768
He was at the party.

35:03.851 --> 35:06.896
Olivia went to the studio
to get a drawing for
his daughter.

35:06.979 --> 35:08.606
We thought
she'd want a bear,

35:08.689 --> 35:10.983
but when I texted her,
she said she wanted a human,

35:11.067 --> 35:13.778
so I went outside
to tell Olivia,

35:13.861 --> 35:16.989
and that's when I heard her
arguing in her studio.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.616
With who?

35:18.699 --> 35:21.452
Well, she went out there
with her fiancé.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.581
- She was engaged?
- Yeah.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.835
And the valet saw him
leaving in a rush
right after.

35:28.918 --> 35:31.879
- Time?
- The text
to the girl is 10:10.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.673
- We have a name?
- Eric Neill.

35:42.890 --> 35:45.643
Nate, come back here.
Leave the gardener.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.896
I'll explain
when you get here.
Just get here.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.398
What's going on, Alan?

35:50.481 --> 35:52.400
I just drove 45 minutes
in two directions.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.027
The boyfriend was overheard
arguing with Olivia

35:55.111 --> 35:58.322
inside the studio
just after 10:00 p.m.
New Year's Eve.

35:58.406 --> 36:01.325
The valet guy saw him
race out in his car
right after.

36:01.409 --> 36:04.662
And just six weeks ago,
she put him in her will.

36:06.122 --> 36:07.707
I'm sorry,
who are we talking about?

36:07.790 --> 36:10.835
His name's Eric Neill.
Had priors-- con man.

36:10.918 --> 36:13.254
- We have to nail this guy.
- Eric Neill.

36:13.337 --> 36:15.172
Okay, what about
the gardener?

36:15.256 --> 36:16.757
No, find out
where he went.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.759
- Off the gardener.
- I can't leave here.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.768
Eric.

36:29.353 --> 36:31.606
Hey.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.357
Hey, Ma.

36:38.821 --> 36:40.823
You don't look good.

36:42.992 --> 36:47.163
Did-- did someone
hurt you?

36:49.373 --> 36:51.542
No, Ma.

36:51.626 --> 36:53.419
No, I, uh--

36:55.838 --> 36:59.050
I hurt someone.

37:02.136 --> 37:03.638
Hmm.

37:05.181 --> 37:06.891
( sighs )

37:09.477 --> 37:12.396
Well,
what I need you to do

37:12.480 --> 37:16.359
is to ask Clarence--
he's the only good one
in here--

37:17.985 --> 37:21.781
why my remote
doesn't get DVDs.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.574
It's just...

37:29.163 --> 37:31.207
Your skin is pale.

37:36.212 --> 37:38.005
You look sick.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.303
Which--
which reminds me,

37:44.387 --> 37:48.474
you've gotta tell your sister
to get some other bulbs.

37:48.557 --> 37:50.810
I told her twice.

37:50.893 --> 37:56.565
These fluorescents,
they're just ghastly.

37:56.649 --> 37:58.192
Joel:
<i>Laura's gonna freak.</i>

37:58.275 --> 37:59.694
She's not
gonna freak, dude.

37:59.777 --> 38:02.446
- No, she will.
- She won't.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.783
Why would she freak if you
were at the movies with me?

38:07.994 --> 38:09.245
Too bad we got
a little buzzed.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.789
You had to crash at my place
in your old room,

38:11.872 --> 38:15.084
which I still haven't
fucking filled.

38:15.167 --> 38:19.255
"Hobbit 2:
Desolation of Smaug."

38:19.338 --> 38:22.258
Yeah, 10:20 showing,
Eastridge Mall.

38:25.594 --> 38:27.972
"Hobbit." Okay.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.350
10:20, okay, cool.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.562
( chuckling )
You want me to
tell you the plot?

38:34.645 --> 38:35.896
It's just
more Hobbity stuff.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.940
- She won't ask anyway.
- ( laughing )

38:39.525 --> 38:41.736
Whoa, whoa!

38:41.819 --> 38:43.237
What happened
to your hand?

38:44.530 --> 38:46.157
Laura and I
got in a fight.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.618
You hit her?

38:49.702 --> 38:51.162
No! Jesus, no.

38:52.621 --> 38:54.540
I don't know,
I was pretty out of it.

38:54.623 --> 38:56.375
I must've hit
a wall or something.

38:58.502 --> 38:59.587
Okay.

39:00.755 --> 39:03.299
"Desolation of Smaug."
10:20.

39:05.092 --> 39:06.427
All right, cool.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.431
So...

39:10.514 --> 39:12.433
do I get to hear
who you were with?

39:15.728 --> 39:18.439
I was with...
( scoffs )

39:18.522 --> 39:20.649
a mistake.

39:20.733 --> 39:23.235
Joel:
Well, I do feel like
we're in a cycle,

39:23.319 --> 39:26.030
and that cycle
just keeps repeating.

39:27.656 --> 39:31.077
Do you remember my--
my uncle with the boats?

39:31.160 --> 39:34.163
- Vern?
- Yeah, Vern.

39:34.246 --> 39:37.875
Well, he said
if you ever wanted
to work for him,

39:37.958 --> 39:40.961
he's got that place,
the alligator place.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.130
- ( sighs )
- I mean, what--

39:43.214 --> 39:45.049
land is cheap
down there.

39:45.132 --> 39:48.344
We could get a--
a really nice piece of land,

39:48.427 --> 39:51.889
like a house with
a wraparound porch.

39:51.972 --> 39:54.975
I've always wanted
a wraparound porch.

39:55.059 --> 39:56.977
We could start fresh.

39:59.021 --> 40:00.940
Let's just go.

40:01.023 --> 40:02.900
Let's just
get out of here.

40:02.983 --> 40:04.235
When?

40:05.402 --> 40:07.071
Now?
( chuckles )

40:07.154 --> 40:09.782
I mean, seriously,
there's nothing
keeping us here.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.326
What about
my truck?

40:13.661 --> 40:14.954
Sell it.

40:15.037 --> 40:17.790
Melissa:
Neill's driving
a 2011 Range Rover.

40:17.873 --> 40:21.043
Mileage: 22 highway--
we assume he's on a highway.

40:21.127 --> 40:23.337
Last fill-up
was two days ago

40:23.420 --> 40:25.965
at the Shell station
on Bleakmoore and Summit.

40:26.048 --> 40:28.968
It's a 14-gallon tank.

40:29.051 --> 40:34.140
So, we should
check gas stations within
a, what, 300-mile radius?

40:34.223 --> 40:35.641
What about the ATM?

40:35.724 --> 40:37.852
Officer:
Once outside
Salt Lake last night,

40:37.935 --> 40:39.812
and again first thing
this morning.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.022
Both 800, his max.

40:42.106 --> 40:45.109
Okay, so he's traveling.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.652
What about
the cell phones?

40:46.735 --> 40:49.155
Officer #2:
Last ping was
just off Temple Square

40:49.238 --> 40:51.323
by the university,

40:51.407 --> 40:53.576
18 hours ago.

40:53.659 --> 40:56.120
Which means what?

40:56.203 --> 40:57.830
- He's still there?
- Mm-hmm.

40:57.913 --> 40:59.331
Melissa:
<i>Or he turned off</i>
<i>his phone.</i>

40:59.415 --> 41:02.251
-<i> Which would be smarter.</i>
- Right.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.878
How long was he there?

41:03.961 --> 41:06.589
Officer #2:
<i>The phone went off</i>
<i>at 10:45 p.m.,</i>

41:06.672 --> 41:10.676
<i>on again at 7:22,</i>
<i>then off for good.</i>

41:10.759 --> 41:12.303
Who'd he spend
the night with?

41:12.386 --> 41:14.430
Officer #3:
<i>I think his mother</i>
<i>is in Salt Lake.</i>

41:14.513 --> 41:17.057
<i>In hospice.</i>

41:17.141 --> 41:20.227
All right.
So...

41:20.311 --> 41:22.021
who's our guy
at Salt Lake PD?

41:22.104 --> 41:23.355
- Nate: Sergeant Reeves?
- Yes.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.857
- It's Charles, right?
- Absolutely.

41:24.940 --> 41:26.317
- How are you?
- I'm well.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.693
- Good to see you again.
- My pleasure. Good to see you.

41:27.776 --> 41:29.236
- Thanks for waiting.
- My pleasure.

41:29.320 --> 41:31.238
Neill's mother
is just down the hallway.

41:31.322 --> 41:34.366
The desk said someone
matching his description
spent the night,

41:34.450 --> 41:36.285
left early
this morning.

41:36.368 --> 41:38.037
His sister's in here
at the moment.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.705
Okay.
How are you?

41:40.789 --> 41:44.126
Well,
let's say hello.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.545
Woman on P.A.:
<i>Dr. Singh, call 3468.</i>

41:46.629 --> 41:48.547
<i>( chatter )</i>

41:53.636 --> 41:55.429
- Miss Neill, hi.
- Hey.

41:55.512 --> 41:57.264
This is Detective Henry,
Summit Police.

41:57.348 --> 41:58.974
- Nice to meet you, ma'am.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.268
- May we come in?
- I'd-- I'd rather you not.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.938
My mother is,
um-- she's sleeping
and she's quite ill.

42:04.021 --> 42:05.147
Sure.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.566
What did Eric do
this time?

42:07.650 --> 42:09.318
You happen to know
where he is?

42:10.819 --> 42:12.613
Probably Truckee.

42:12.696 --> 42:15.491
We have a cabin there
in North Shore Lake Tahoe,
California side.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.327
What'd he do?

42:18.410 --> 42:20.162
It's very important
that we speak with him.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.456
Do you happen to have
an address for this cabin?

42:22.539 --> 42:26.252
Woman on PA:
<i>Pickup at outpatient PT.</i>
<i>Pickup at outpatient PT.</i>

42:26.335 --> 42:27.628
Yeah.

42:29.338 --> 42:32.007
-<i> ( car door opens )</i>
-<i> ( door buzzing )</i>

42:33.592 --> 42:34.635
<i>( buzzing stops )</i>

42:39.390 --> 42:42.059
( speaking Spanish )

42:44.311 --> 42:47.982
<i>My friend,</i>
<i>too much miles.</i>

42:48.065 --> 42:49.984
But it runs
really good, man.

42:50.067 --> 42:52.194
It always has.

42:52.278 --> 42:53.862
I'll tell you what,

42:53.946 --> 42:55.489
you take her
for a test spin,

42:55.572 --> 42:57.241
<i>you name the price.</i>

42:58.492 --> 42:59.868
I drive?

42:59.952 --> 43:01.287
<i>Start her up.</i>

43:04.290 --> 43:06.208
( engine starts )

43:29.356 --> 43:31.734
I don't understand
what's happening.

43:33.402 --> 43:36.405
I haven't slept
one minute

43:36.488 --> 43:37.531
<i>in three days.</i>

43:39.325 --> 43:41.201
<i>W-where's</i>
<i>the other guy?</i>

43:41.285 --> 43:42.870
<i>I told the other guy</i>
<i>the same thing.</i>

43:42.953 --> 43:44.538
<i>I-I don't understand</i>
<i>what's happening.</i>

43:44.621 --> 43:46.582
Yeah.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.418
Well...

43:49.501 --> 43:54.423
apparently, Detective Pape
doesn't believe that you
don't understand.

43:55.924 --> 43:57.926
So we're gonna
do this again.

43:59.303 --> 44:00.679
And again.

44:02.222 --> 44:04.016
- I'm gonna offer you--
- I don't want a lawyer.

44:04.099 --> 44:05.893
I don't need a lawyer.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.270
Do you understand
the implications if you
don't get--

44:08.354 --> 44:09.980
<i>I don't want a lawyer.</i>

44:17.780 --> 44:19.198
Okay.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.035
So, it's New Year's Eve.

44:23.118 --> 44:25.537
You tell Olivia
the truth.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.289
She hits you,

44:27.373 --> 44:29.750
she threatens
to call the police.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.168
Yes.

44:31.251 --> 44:32.711
You bolt.

44:32.795 --> 44:34.171
Yes.

44:34.254 --> 44:37.883
You realize that if she does
call the police,

44:37.966 --> 44:39.551
you're effed.

44:39.635 --> 44:43.597
You have priors,
so you come back.

44:43.680 --> 44:44.765
No.

44:44.848 --> 44:47.935
So, you came back
into the studio.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.436
You tried
to talk sense into her.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.563
<i>No, seriously,</i>
<i>that's not what happened.</i>

44:51.647 --> 44:53.524
<i>I never came back.</i>

44:53.607 --> 44:55.442
<i>I never came back.</i>

44:55.526 --> 44:58.404
<i>I never, ever,</i>
<i>ever came back.</i>

44:58.487 --> 45:01.782
I didn't find out
that she was...

45:03.617 --> 45:07.162
until they came for me
in Truckee.

45:18.715 --> 45:20.300
What I don't understand

45:20.384 --> 45:23.429
is why you changed
your story twice

45:23.512 --> 45:25.722
in Truckee
when the police came.

45:25.806 --> 45:29.309
( sniffles, sighs )

45:30.894 --> 45:32.771
Come on, man.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.357
We got your prints
on the hammer.

45:35.441 --> 45:37.484
She had just put you
into her will.

45:39.194 --> 45:40.404
She did?

45:43.031 --> 45:44.908
<i>( chatter )</i>

45:51.957 --> 45:53.333
<i>( phone chimes )</i>

46:11.185 --> 46:13.020
Oh, shit.

46:13.103 --> 46:14.730
Yeah,
I'm-- I'm sorry.

46:14.813 --> 46:17.649
This is super silly,
but I have been tasked

46:17.733 --> 46:21.320
with tracking down
literally 125 people

46:21.403 --> 46:24.823
and getting their
literal whereabouts

46:24.907 --> 46:27.493
between 9:30
and 1:00 a.m.

46:27.576 --> 46:29.328
- Well...
- Movies, right?

46:29.411 --> 46:30.662
- Yeah, movies.
- With Frank.

46:30.746 --> 46:32.289
- Yeah, with Frank.
- Right.

46:32.372 --> 46:35.000
We took El Camino
to Arroyo Parkway

46:35.083 --> 46:38.128
to the Eastridge Mall
and saw the 10:20
"Hobbit 2."

46:40.130 --> 46:42.090
( chuckling )
Okay, all right.

46:42.174 --> 46:44.301
10:20.
Thank you.

46:45.886 --> 46:48.305
( Scottish accent )
You are dismissed, laddie.

46:48.388 --> 46:49.890
- ( both chuckling )
- Good accent.

46:49.973 --> 46:51.767
Let's go talk
to Frankie.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.560
<i>( door opens )</i>

47:01.318 --> 47:02.611
Okay.

47:02.694 --> 47:04.530
- Okay.
- Your turn.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.490
My turn.

47:06.573 --> 47:08.742
I'll bring him
right back,
I promise.

47:11.036 --> 47:13.038
So, what'd I miss?

47:13.121 --> 47:15.249
Um, well, Mel
was just saying

47:15.332 --> 47:18.252
there's this weird pressure
to solve this thing fast.

47:20.546 --> 47:22.172
- From who?
- Oh, my God,

47:22.256 --> 47:24.758
it's, you know,
people on the hill

47:24.841 --> 47:27.761
to the DA
to Nate's boss to Nate.

47:27.844 --> 47:29.763
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>it's all the way down.</i>

47:29.846 --> 47:32.099
<i>They're trying to send</i>
<i>a message to the riffraff.</i>

47:32.182 --> 47:34.518
<i>( Laura chuckles )</i>
<i>Do we even have riffraff?</i>

47:34.601 --> 47:36.645
Melissa:
<i>Um, we had</i>
<i>that shoplifter...</i>

47:36.728 --> 47:38.605
<i>( voice fades )</i>

47:40.816 --> 47:44.319
<i>( music playing )</i>
