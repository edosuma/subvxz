01:09.667 --> 01:10.792
Where are the boys?

01:12.958 --> 01:14.083
Come here, you!

01:14.250 --> 01:16.833
You whore! Come with me!

01:28.208 --> 01:29.625
Don't touch my brother!

01:30.167 --> 01:33.250
- Let him go!
- Where's your mother?

01:33.833 --> 01:34.958
Let them go!

01:35.167 --> 01:36.917
They're just kids!
Let them go.

01:44.250 --> 01:46.750
Let's fucking castrate him now,

01:46.917 --> 01:49.125
it's no fun when they're dead.

01:49.292 --> 01:51.958
Damn it! Let's just finish this!

01:52.125 --> 01:55.083
You can kill every priest
and landlord in Spain,

01:55.250 --> 01:56.958
but you'll never win!

01:57.125 --> 01:58.208
You're scum!

02:07.458 --> 02:10.167
Now bring out his wife and kids.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.667
No!
You can't kill two innocent boys.

02:12.833 --> 02:13.500
No!

02:13.667 --> 02:15.625
I'm not even his wife.

02:16.750 --> 02:17.875
Josico.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.292
Josico, tell him.

02:19.875 --> 02:22.958
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
We were never married.

02:23.167 --> 02:26.542
These poor boys
won't even inherit his name!

02:26.708 --> 02:28.042
Is that true?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.917
Yes, she was his mistress.

02:31.292 --> 02:33.667
But he wouldn't marry a maid.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.292
So the boys were born bastards.

02:36.583 --> 02:38.667
Typical bloody toff.

02:39.667 --> 02:40.667
Don't touch me.

02:40.833 --> 02:43.500
- Don't fucking touch me!
- Please!

02:46.500 --> 02:47.583
We'll let them go.

02:48.417 --> 02:50.333
Should we torch the castle?

02:50.500 --> 02:52.833
No, no.
It'll make a nice HQ.

02:52.958 --> 02:56.792
I'm sure our maid here
will keep it tidy, right?

02:56.958 --> 02:58.042
Right?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.958
Now throw this sack of shit
to the vultures!

03:13.667 --> 03:17.667
UNCERTAIN GLORY

03:42.375 --> 03:44.042
Long live the Republic!

05:29.667 --> 05:32.958
ARAGON FRONT
SPANISH CIVIL WAR, JUNE 1937

05:42.292 --> 05:43.750
I'm Lieutenant Sales.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.208
- Forgive me, lieutenant.
- At ease.

05:46.750 --> 05:48.750
I'm to report to Captain Picó.

05:49.458 --> 05:50.875
He's been expecting you.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.292
He's at the river.

05:52.875 --> 05:54.583
Suau, go with the Lieutenant.

05:58.708 --> 06:02.208
We have two great enemies:
lice and pornography.

06:02.625 --> 06:05.625
Plagues of war,
as Napoleon called them.

06:06.042 --> 06:08.125
Lice and pornography!

06:09.208 --> 06:11.708
We will only defeat our enemies

06:11.875 --> 06:16.792
if we scrub ourselves clean,
both physically and morally.

06:17.917 --> 06:19.583
OK, hand it out.

06:19.750 --> 06:22.250
- Yes, sir!
- Make good use of this soap.

06:22.875 --> 06:24.375
And make it last.

06:24.750 --> 06:25.875
Is that clear?

06:26.042 --> 06:26.875
Is that clear?

06:27.042 --> 06:28.500
Yes, sir!

06:28.667 --> 06:31.333
Now get undressed.
Fall out!

06:38.875 --> 06:41.375
You too, lieutenant.
Don't be shy.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.208
Don't be ashamed
of your shameful parts!

06:46.375 --> 06:47.542
We've all got one.

06:47.708 --> 06:51.250
I want the cleanest regiment
in the Republican army.

06:51.417 --> 06:53.125
Then, and only then,

06:53.292 --> 06:57.292
will we dirty our hands
with the blood of those fascists.

06:57.458 --> 07:01.125
Hygiene is the first step to glory!

07:03.458 --> 07:05.917
This whole battalion is disgusting.

07:06.417 --> 07:07.708
No hygiene or culture.

07:07.875 --> 07:10.333
As long as they will fight
for their ideals...

07:10.500 --> 07:11.958
Nobody here has ideals.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.750
Or principles... Hey!

07:14.917 --> 07:16.542
We need them, if we want to win.

07:16.708 --> 07:19.167
This front has been dead for months.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.667
Franco is concentrating on Madrid,

07:21.833 --> 07:24.875
and we're here,
like cast-off old whores.

07:25.042 --> 07:26.417
We have to do something.

07:26.583 --> 07:28.375
You want to kill fascists.

07:28.542 --> 07:30.458
I don't want to kill anyone.

07:30.625 --> 07:33.167
But we need to defend
the rights of the Republic.

07:36.167 --> 07:39.167
I hear there's an officer here
called Soleràs.

07:39.333 --> 07:41.208
- Juli Soleràs?
- Juli, yes.

07:41.375 --> 07:42.542
What about him?

07:42.708 --> 07:44.667
We're mates.
We studied together.

07:44.833 --> 07:47.958
That surprises me.
A cultured man like yourself...

07:48.125 --> 07:50.958
What?
Juli is educated and clever...

07:51.167 --> 07:52.792
He has no morals or principles.

07:52.958 --> 07:54.625
Take the last battle we had.

07:54.792 --> 07:57.458
He took out 20 fascists
with a machine gun,

07:57.625 --> 07:59.750
then he just buggered off

07:59.917 --> 08:02.292
and left,
in the middle of the battle.

08:02.458 --> 08:03.625
Don't laugh.

08:03.792 --> 08:05.875
We should've shot him for it.

08:06.750 --> 08:08.958
This is it.
You'll be all right here.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.458
Olegaria!

08:13.833 --> 08:15.333
Yes, Captain.

08:15.500 --> 08:18.083
You'll eat well in this house.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.875
Look, some tasty haggis.

08:23.083 --> 08:24.750
I'll show you around.

08:25.542 --> 08:26.958
My nephew.

08:27.417 --> 08:28.417
Handsome.

08:29.250 --> 08:31.042
Joined up at 16.

08:31.208 --> 08:34.207
I don't know which regiment,
he's on the other side.

08:34.375 --> 08:35.957
This way, Master Lluís.

08:36.832 --> 08:39.167
You'll have the boy's room.

08:39.667 --> 08:41.957
The war caught him
on the other side.

08:42.125 --> 08:43.917
That's how it is here.

08:44.082 --> 08:46.042
You enlist or you get shot.

08:46.208 --> 08:48.583
At least it wasn't the anarchists.

08:48.750 --> 08:51.625
They killed all the friars
from the monastery.

08:52.667 --> 08:54.375
Master Lluís,

08:54.542 --> 08:55.917
don't take this badly,

08:56.083 --> 08:58.292
but I don't care
who wins the war.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.208
I just want it to end.

09:20.417 --> 09:24.083
DEAR TRINI

09:40.042 --> 09:42.750
In my village,
we have ploughs for this.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.792
But they don't give you soap.

09:45.958 --> 09:48.292
Why do they need a trench anyway?

09:48.458 --> 09:51.542
To bury us in when we're killed.
Saves time.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.125
Listen up!

09:54.125 --> 09:57.583
That trench is to protect us
from the enemy.

09:57.750 --> 10:00.292
From here,
we can spot any movement.

10:00.458 --> 10:03.167
It protects us
from bullets and bombs.

10:03.625 --> 10:06.333
Some of us might die in this trench,

10:06.500 --> 10:09.583
but we will beat them from here.
Got it?

10:09.750 --> 10:10.750
Yes, sir!

10:42.958 --> 10:45.417
We bring our dying animals here.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.292
While they can still walk.
Then we throw them down.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.375
The vultures do the rest.

10:53.167 --> 10:55.083
Some people end up here too.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.333
My husband is down there.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.167
- You're new here.
- Yes.

11:10.500 --> 11:11.833
I'm training the soldiers.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.458
Really?
What does that involve?

11:15.083 --> 11:16.583
Teaching them to kill.

11:16.958 --> 11:18.833
I thought that came naturally.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.167
I almost killed my mother
when I was born.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.417
That little one there
almost killed me.

11:27.333 --> 11:28.625
I'm glad he didn't.

11:30.958 --> 11:32.458
How come you speak Catalan?

11:34.125 --> 11:36.167
My husband was from Barcelona.

11:36.333 --> 11:37.708
I lived there for years.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.333
- Are you from Barcelona?
- Yes.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.542
And when you're not
giving killing lessons?

11:43.500 --> 11:46.625
I studied law.
I wanted to be a lawyer.

11:47.417 --> 11:49.750
I see you're from a good family.

11:49.917 --> 11:52.000
This desert is bigger than it looks.

11:52.917 --> 11:55.958
In those boots,
you won't even reach the enemy.

12:42.542 --> 12:44.542
- What?
- Don't you ever knock?

12:44.708 --> 12:46.958
Too risky.
People wouldn't let me in.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.542
Let's not get carried away.

12:51.708 --> 12:54.083
You have a great view from here.

12:54.417 --> 12:56.375
How do you always get what I want?

12:56.750 --> 12:58.500
By being friendly and polite.

13:00.083 --> 13:01.333
You still have it?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.958
This?
I'll take it to my grave.

13:04.292 --> 13:07.125
- Anything interesting up there?
- More than here.

13:07.292 --> 13:08.958
I bet. This place is dead.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.667
The Fascists
could be in Barcelona by now,

13:11.833 --> 13:14.875
but they use the ARAGON front
to make the war drag on.

13:15.042 --> 13:18.083
The longer it takes,
the greater the triumph.

13:18.375 --> 13:19.792
And we get to die of boredom.

13:19.958 --> 13:22.083
But smelling of soap!

13:22.792 --> 13:25.917
Not you!
You stink like a pig.

13:26.083 --> 13:27.833
Follow my scent, then shoot me.

13:27.958 --> 13:29.375
Sounds good.

13:30.875 --> 13:34.167
Let's celebrate this reunion
with some fascist brandy.

13:34.333 --> 13:36.625
- Are you crazy?
- I know where to get some.

13:39.167 --> 13:41.750
You achieved glory
by killing a load of fascists,

13:41.917 --> 13:43.250
then just walked away.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.083
I left when it was over.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.792
Glory only lasts a second.

13:47.958 --> 13:50.500
I experienced it and then I split.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.167
I must admit,
it felt like an eternity.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.458
Now I'm counting chickpeas.

13:57.625 --> 14:01.208
Apparently, someone
who leaves their post like that

14:01.375 --> 14:02.708
can't be trusted.

14:04.750 --> 14:06.417
Am I a bad example to the men?

14:06.958 --> 14:07.958
Yes.

14:13.292 --> 14:13.958
Juli?

14:14.125 --> 14:16.542
Watch your back!
Always watch your back.

14:16.708 --> 14:18.792
You can't trust your mates.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.125
Dinner's ready!

14:25.958 --> 14:27.333
Look.

14:29.750 --> 14:31.250
Look, a piano.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.042
Juli!

15:12.250 --> 15:13.625
Juli, get down.

15:13.792 --> 15:14.792
Juli!

15:43.417 --> 15:44.667
It's somebody's house!

15:44.833 --> 15:48.625
You don't abandon a house
and expect to find it the same.

15:48.792 --> 15:50.583
- Juli, you're an officer.
- Yes.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.083
You shouldn't be stealing,
or counting chickpeas.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.750
My subordinate does that.
You know I'm no good at numbers.

15:59.125 --> 15:59.875
<i>Et Voilà.</i>

16:00.042 --> 16:02.042
So what are you good at?

16:02.958 --> 16:04.250
Escapism.

16:05.042 --> 16:07.958
I could do it for a living
when I grow up.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.708
But you're good at it too.

16:09.875 --> 16:11.708
What do you mean?

16:11.875 --> 16:15.208
Ask Trini.
You don't even open her letters.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.458
Spying on your best friend now?

16:17.625 --> 16:19.667
Don't you care about anything?

16:19.833 --> 16:22.708
The man of great principles
is wrong again.

16:23.250 --> 16:26.125
You know what I care about?
The stars.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.250
And one in particular.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.708
It's getting fainter every day,
and is about to go out.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.542
There are millions of stars.

16:34.792 --> 16:36.375
Be careful, Lluís.

16:36.833 --> 16:39.167
Trini is like
these abandoned houses.

16:39.667 --> 16:41.833
A stranger
could start poking around.

16:43.417 --> 16:45.250
Don't talk to me about Trini.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.875
Juli! Come!

17:02.500 --> 17:05.416
- What is it?
- There are some fascists over there.

17:09.083 --> 17:12.208
- See?
- Yes. So what? That's their side.

17:12.750 --> 17:13.750
What do you mean?

17:13.833 --> 17:17.416
Abandoned villages are the store
where both sides go shopping.

17:17.583 --> 17:19.833
If nobody crosses the line, it's fine.

17:20.166 --> 17:21.458
Put your gun away.

17:42.208 --> 17:44.667
- Reporting for duty, Captain.
- At ease.

17:44.833 --> 17:47.917
I'm making a contraption
to scare away the flies.

17:48.083 --> 17:50.458
This says
I'm to requisition a horse.

17:50.625 --> 17:54.208
This is a large area,
and we're short of cavalry.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.417
You'll need to get closer
to the other side.

17:56.583 --> 17:59.875
So where can I find one?
The locals only have donkeys.

18:00.042 --> 18:02.500
You can use the <i> Carlán's</i> mare.

18:02.667 --> 18:05.125
His widow has kindly offered
to let you ride her.

18:06.125 --> 18:06.875
Me?

18:07.042 --> 18:08.875
You made a good impression.

18:34.750 --> 18:35.792
Shut up!

18:35.958 --> 18:36.958
Is Mrs Olivella home?

19:06.208 --> 19:07.208
Leave us, Fermín.

19:08.625 --> 19:11.042
And put the axe away,
we're not at war here.

19:12.458 --> 19:13.458
Are we?

19:13.625 --> 19:14.708
No.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.583
I don't have servants.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.750
Just him, and a maid
who is out with the boys.

19:19.917 --> 19:21.333
Mrs Olivella.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.167
Forgive my boldness.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.792
The Captain sent me
about the horse.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.042
- The horse...
- My late husband's horse.

19:36.333 --> 19:37.917
She is yours to use.

19:38.083 --> 19:41.750
But you won't get far
with those boots. Follow me.

19:43.500 --> 19:47.167
You be rough
and gentle at the same time.

19:48.625 --> 19:50.958
My husband did it every night.

19:52.625 --> 19:55.083
He loved Bellota
more than anything.

19:57.583 --> 19:59.458
Only he could ride her.

20:02.125 --> 20:03.917
I'm sorry to deprive you of her.

20:04.083 --> 20:07.208
We're at war.
We must help however we can.

20:07.833 --> 20:09.583
We can't hang on
to what we have.

20:11.042 --> 20:13.875
We could lose everything
in an instant.

20:14.750 --> 20:17.958
And since she's had
nobody to ride her,

20:19.250 --> 20:20.958
she's been very sad.

20:21.875 --> 20:25.125
She's getting old,
she thinks nobody loves her.

20:27.583 --> 20:28.625
Get on.

20:57.875 --> 20:58.875
Easy.

21:01.792 --> 21:02.875
Good, Bellota.

21:03.875 --> 21:06.375
I think she likes you.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.167
You must have work to do.

21:09.333 --> 21:11.208
Yes, inspecting the troops.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.833
Don't forget to teach them
staying alive.

21:13.958 --> 21:15.500
It's harder than killing,

21:16.208 --> 21:18.333
although sometimes,
the two go together.

22:04.292 --> 22:06.542
What a fine companion, Master Lluís.

22:06.708 --> 22:08.542
- Where can I put her?
- Under shelter.

22:08.708 --> 22:12.333
They say it's going to rain,
and this place floods easily.

22:13.500 --> 22:15.083
Look at the horse.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.583
What are they whispering?

22:17.792 --> 22:19.625
Mind your own business!

22:20.375 --> 22:23.375
That's the <i> Carlana's</i> horse, isn't it?

22:23.542 --> 22:24.917
Yes. The Lady of the Manor.

22:28.375 --> 22:29.208
What's so funny?

22:29.375 --> 22:33.333
The <i> Carlana</i> is anything but a lady.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.583
What do you mean?

22:34.917 --> 22:36.542
If only you knew.

22:36.708 --> 22:38.833
Her own father, Cagorcio,

22:38.958 --> 22:41.417
called her "the dirty pig" because

22:41.583 --> 22:43.458
she would bathe
naked in a trough,

22:43.625 --> 22:45.250
and it shocked people here.

22:45.417 --> 22:47.083
She seemed a very nice lady.

22:47.250 --> 22:48.958
If you say so, but the <i> Carlana</i>

22:49.167 --> 22:52.875
is not a lady,
she's not even the <i> Carlán's</i> widow.

22:53.042 --> 22:55.292
He just gave her two bastard sons.

23:27.875 --> 23:28.875
Good morning.

23:29.042 --> 23:30.958
I'm with the Republicans here,

23:31.167 --> 23:33.458
but my wife is sick in Barcelona.

23:33.625 --> 23:35.375
If you were going that way...

23:38.875 --> 23:42.375
I can drop you at Plaza Palau,
where I'm going.

23:42.750 --> 23:44.625
Don't ask me to go any further.

23:46.625 --> 23:48.792
No, no.
In the back with the sheep.

23:49.958 --> 23:51.917
Fine.
I like them more than people.

24:03.333 --> 24:07.333
BARCELONA

24:16.792 --> 24:17.875
Hurry up.

24:22.417 --> 24:23.417
Here.

24:24.292 --> 24:25.542
At your service.

24:25.958 --> 24:27.125
Comrade!

25:27.417 --> 25:29.333
Eat your onion.

26:38.708 --> 26:39.708
Trini!

26:44.708 --> 26:46.375
Juli!

26:46.625 --> 26:47.792
Always playing!

26:48.750 --> 26:49.833
You smell great.

26:49.958 --> 26:51.083
You stink of sheep.

26:51.250 --> 26:54.625
No, it's dung.
The latest perfume from Paris.

26:55.958 --> 26:57.292
How is Lluís?

26:57.458 --> 26:59.958
Fine.
Getting on with the new regiment.

27:00.125 --> 27:03.083
- He hasn't written for months.
- That place is a mess.

27:03.250 --> 27:05.958
But don't worry,
the front itself is quiet.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.250
Not like here then.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.083
People don't realise
how hellish life is in Barcelona.

27:10.292 --> 27:11.500
Ramonet!

27:11.875 --> 27:14.292
- Uncle Juli!
- Hello!

27:15.250 --> 27:16.750
- What did you bring me?
- Ramonet!

27:16.917 --> 27:18.417
- You'll see.
- Always want more.

27:18.583 --> 27:19.917
He's like me.

27:20.375 --> 27:23.333
- Look!
- Uncle Juli brought you a doll.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.292
Dolls are for girls.

27:25.458 --> 27:29.542
Not a doll, a soldier,
like your daddy and me.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.583
We'll make him a rifle
and a uniform. Here.

27:35.625 --> 27:37.375
Put these greens on to boil.

27:37.542 --> 27:40.083
- And the potatoes?
- No, there aren't any.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.458
I have something for you too.

27:44.958 --> 27:46.167
Is that a Christmas tree?

27:46.333 --> 27:49.042
I keep them.
They're like treasure.

27:49.208 --> 27:50.667
If it wasn't for you...

27:51.500 --> 27:53.083
I'd like to do more.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.708
You do plenty.

27:57.917 --> 27:59.917
Did you know we got baptized?

28:00.458 --> 28:01.958
No, that is a miracle.

28:02.125 --> 28:04.625
Trini, the atheist anarchist
gets baptized.

28:04.792 --> 28:07.458
- I daren't tell Lluís.
- He'd kill you.

28:07.625 --> 28:09.167
I know,

28:09.792 --> 28:11.708
but it makes me feel less alone.

28:13.292 --> 28:14.458
Hold out your hand.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.167
It's beautiful.

28:26.667 --> 28:27.708
Where did you find it?

28:28.167 --> 28:32.167
In a church with no roof.
It's really dark.

28:32.333 --> 28:34.708
I go there to look at the stars.

28:35.542 --> 28:38.167
- Is it a meteorite?
- I don't know.

28:38.333 --> 28:40.167
You're the geologist.

28:42.125 --> 28:43.625
I'll study it.

28:44.250 --> 28:46.833
Wherever it came from,

28:46.958 --> 28:49.458
it's the best gift I've ever had.

29:16.417 --> 29:17.417
Hurry up!

29:18.042 --> 29:20.375
It's going to pour down any minute.

29:20.875 --> 29:23.625
Fasten it down,
or it'll get washed away.

29:32.792 --> 29:34.750
You rascal!

29:34.917 --> 29:36.500
You rascal!

29:36.667 --> 29:39.167
You've blinded me!

29:39.458 --> 29:42.667
You've blinded me!

29:43.083 --> 29:46.583
The little girl
saw her chance to escape.

29:46.750 --> 29:49.042
When she reached the door,

29:49.208 --> 29:51.667
she couldn't believe her eyes.

29:51.833 --> 29:55.958
The stepmother was holding
a huge stick to beat her with.

29:56.542 --> 30:00.458
Why doesn't my dad
go and bash the stepmother?

30:00.625 --> 30:02.625
He can't.
He's away at the war.

30:02.792 --> 30:04.542
Then I want to go too.

30:04.875 --> 30:08.375
Really?
But then who will look after me?

30:08.542 --> 30:10.375
I will, Mummy.

30:20.292 --> 30:21.292
How are you?

30:23.458 --> 30:25.208
Tired, Trini.

30:26.167 --> 30:27.583
I want to leave this world,

30:27.750 --> 30:30.583
or get married,
and read fairy tales.

30:30.750 --> 30:34.042
- Why don't you then?
- No woman could love me.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.667
You? You're made
to make some woman happy.

30:36.833 --> 30:38.083
Then marry me.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.958
- Don't be an animal.
- An animal? Me?

30:40.125 --> 30:42.292
Yes, you! Animal!

30:43.792 --> 30:45.708
I can talk to you like a brother.

30:47.125 --> 30:49.250
Lluís is completely ignoring me.

30:49.625 --> 30:53.417
I know you're trying
to get him to come back to me,

30:54.458 --> 30:56.750
but I don't think
it'll ever be the same.

31:14.833 --> 31:17.250
This country
has been poisoned forever.

31:18.583 --> 31:20.833
Don't let the mud cover your eyes.

31:21.667 --> 31:23.333
You have to see the stars.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.750
Our ideals were so good,

31:27.167 --> 31:29.250
so beautiful to live by,

31:30.083 --> 31:32.208
really believing in something.

31:32.375 --> 31:33.708
That's over, Trini.

31:34.917 --> 31:38.000
One year, the spring won't return.

31:39.083 --> 31:43.417
April, that month of uncertain glory,
is slipping through our fingers.

31:44.833 --> 31:47.458
Uncertain or not, it's the only glory.

31:48.833 --> 31:51.500
What comes after will be nausea.

32:29.417 --> 32:30.417
Lieutenant!

32:30.458 --> 32:33.458
Come inside!
Don't stand there in the rain.

32:34.375 --> 32:35.792
Oh, there she is.

32:36.208 --> 32:39.083
We'd have offered you shelter
in our mill,

32:39.250 --> 32:41.167
but you saw what happened to it.

32:41.625 --> 32:42.750
It's bad luck.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.667
It's a catastrophe.

32:45.208 --> 32:48.458
Our daughter-in-law
died in childbirth.

32:49.083 --> 32:51.292
The war took away our sons.

32:52.583 --> 32:54.083
And now, with no mill,

32:54.875 --> 32:57.417
we're all going to starve.

32:57.708 --> 33:02.208
If you keep crying like that,
you'll flood the shack as well.

33:02.375 --> 33:03.875
Oh, dear Lord!

33:04.208 --> 33:08.375
Don't worry,
I'll go and see the <i> Carlana</i>

33:08.542 --> 33:10.833
and ask her to rent us her mill.

33:10.958 --> 33:13.667
She'll slam the door in your face.

33:14.167 --> 33:16.292
She lent me the <i> Carlán's</i> mare,

33:16.458 --> 33:18.333
to help our cause.

33:18.500 --> 33:21.333
Because you're a gentleman.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.958
And you are her neighbours.

33:25.542 --> 33:28.250
Ever since
she moved into that castle,

33:29.292 --> 33:31.917
she hasn't spoken
to us in the village.

33:32.083 --> 33:34.083
My wife's right.

33:35.042 --> 33:39.500
I'm ashamed to ask you this,
but...

33:39.958 --> 33:44.167
being as she seems to like you,

33:44.542 --> 33:46.708
maybe you could ask her for us.

33:47.208 --> 33:49.792
Well, she only lent me the horse.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.667
She never let anyone else ride it.

33:57.167 --> 33:58.500
All right.

33:59.083 --> 34:00.458
I'll talk to her.

34:06.708 --> 34:07.750
Bellota!

34:12.125 --> 34:14.875
Where were you?

34:19.458 --> 34:20.792
What are you doing?

34:22.625 --> 34:24.292
Go on, sit down.

34:24.708 --> 34:26.708
Leave your boots in the corner.

34:32.167 --> 34:34.792
Let me help, I'm used to this.

34:35.750 --> 34:36.917
Pull.

34:37.917 --> 34:40.500
I'm glad to see Bellota came back.

34:40.792 --> 34:42.042
I was worried.

34:42.292 --> 34:44.958
Don't worry so much,
you'll get wrinkles.

34:45.500 --> 34:46.958
Now pull!

34:54.083 --> 34:55.583
You told me to pull.

34:58.667 --> 34:59.667
Put these on.

35:00.708 --> 35:02.292
They were my husband's.

35:02.708 --> 35:04.583
So, what can I do for you?

35:04.833 --> 35:07.250
You're not only here for the horse.

35:07.417 --> 35:11.167
I wouldn't want
to abuse your kindness, but...

35:11.333 --> 35:14.583
the miller and his wife
would like to rent...

35:14.750 --> 35:16.958
- My mill?
- Yes.

35:17.125 --> 35:18.125
How did you know?

35:18.500 --> 35:22.500
I saw the river flood theirs.
I see everything from up here.

35:23.167 --> 35:25.458
They've been left with nothing...

35:25.625 --> 35:27.833
They can come and discuss terms
when they like.

35:27.958 --> 35:28.792
Thank you.

35:28.958 --> 35:30.375
I'll tell them.

35:31.083 --> 35:32.292
Sit down, please.

35:32.458 --> 35:34.083
Don't be shy.

35:35.958 --> 35:38.333
You like helping people, don't you?

35:38.542 --> 35:40.083
Yes, when I can.

35:41.917 --> 35:43.917
Could you help me?

35:44.917 --> 35:45.917
You?

35:47.333 --> 35:49.083
You said you were a lawyer.

35:49.833 --> 35:51.917
I studied to become a lawyer.

35:52.708 --> 35:55.125
I need help with a legal matter.

35:55.458 --> 35:56.958
I'll help, if I can.

35:58.333 --> 35:59.333
Tell me more.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.833
I'm sure you've heard by now

36:01.958 --> 36:04.958
that I was the <i> Carlán's</i> maid,
and he never married me.

36:08.583 --> 36:09.792
Yes, you've heard.

36:12.750 --> 36:15.417
What people don't know
is that my husband,

36:15.583 --> 36:18.250
suspecting the anarchists
would kill him,

36:18.417 --> 36:21.542
married me
so our children would be his heirs.

36:22.333 --> 36:23.958
We did it at the monastery.

36:24.417 --> 36:26.667
But the anarchists
destroyed everything,

36:26.833 --> 36:29.292
leaving no witnesses
of the marriage alive.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.542
Now nobody believes me.

36:31.417 --> 36:33.458
But you must have
a marriage certificate.

36:33.958 --> 36:34.958
No.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.958
Come and sit here.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.375
Give me your foot.

36:54.958 --> 36:58.333
The problem is
that without that certificate,

37:00.292 --> 37:01.667
my husband's family

37:02.917 --> 37:04.958
will claim this estate
when the war ends.

37:06.750 --> 37:09.917
And my sons and I
will be homeless.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.583
But that certificate must exist.

37:13.958 --> 37:15.625
It's in the monastery.

37:16.375 --> 37:19.708
But I wouldn't know
where to look for it.

37:20.708 --> 37:23.708
And the place
makes my skin crawl.

37:26.583 --> 37:28.625
Why don't you look for it?

39:38.333 --> 39:39.458
MARRIAGES

40:03.625 --> 40:04.792
Fuck Juli!

40:05.625 --> 40:07.542
You always appear unexpectedly!

40:07.708 --> 40:09.958
- Ditto.
- What are you doing here?

40:10.125 --> 40:12.208
This is my favourite place.

40:12.792 --> 40:15.958
Silent corpses,
the stench of betrayal...

40:16.667 --> 40:18.625
It's grotesque and macabre.

40:18.792 --> 40:20.083
As if it were my home.

40:20.250 --> 40:23.917
Juli, I'm not in the mood
for an absurd speech.

40:24.083 --> 40:27.083
All that riding
seems to have upset you.

40:27.333 --> 40:28.167
What did you say?

40:28.333 --> 40:30.083
Isn't that the <i> Carlana's</i> mare?

40:30.250 --> 40:32.375
She loaned it to the regiment.

40:32.542 --> 40:34.333
Stop being modest.

40:34.500 --> 40:36.542
You got it.
I was left frustrated.

40:36.708 --> 40:37.875
What?

40:38.042 --> 40:40.333
She never let me ride her.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.458
- What are you insinuating?
- Nothing, except...

40:43.625 --> 40:46.500
I imagine you have
returned the favour.

40:48.417 --> 40:50.792
Don't get caught in her web, Lluís.

40:50.958 --> 40:52.625
Why should I listen to you?

40:53.417 --> 40:55.958
I'm your best friend, remember?

40:58.208 --> 41:01.583
Trust me, and look after
those who really need you.

41:08.542 --> 41:09.542
It's an air raid!

41:10.250 --> 41:11.958
Everybody out!

41:12.958 --> 41:15.958
- Give me a loaf.
- Outside, Trini. Hurry.

41:16.167 --> 41:18.375
You have a child to protect.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.417
Outside!

41:38.667 --> 41:40.417
Help me!

41:49.708 --> 41:52.208
Hurry, come inside!

42:18.833 --> 42:21.833
If it's impossible
to find that document,

42:23.042 --> 42:24.375
why not make a new one?

42:24.958 --> 42:25.958
What do you mean?

42:26.083 --> 42:27.542
You know the law.

42:27.708 --> 42:30.500
You could get a judge
to write something...

42:30.667 --> 42:33.500
Are you asking me
to forge a document?

42:33.667 --> 42:36.000
I'm asking you to help us.

42:38.208 --> 42:39.500
I'm sorry.

42:39.958 --> 42:42.792
I understand your situation,

42:42.958 --> 42:46.250
but what you're asking
is against the law.

42:46.417 --> 42:49.542
Don't tell me about the law.
It's never helped me.

42:49.958 --> 42:52.792
That's why I'm asking you
to help me get justice.

42:54.042 --> 42:55.042
Look,

42:56.292 --> 42:58.625
I was born poor,
I know how that is.

42:59.167 --> 43:01.750
I'm Cagorcio's daughter.
You must've heard.

43:02.125 --> 43:06.292
I watched as they daubed shit on
this castle and called me a whore.

43:06.958 --> 43:08.667
I can take all that,

43:09.708 --> 43:13.500
but I won't see my two boys
pay for this senseless war.

43:19.292 --> 43:21.958
If I could find a witness,

43:22.167 --> 43:23.583
I could make them testify.

43:23.750 --> 43:25.583
I told you, they're all dead.

43:51.833 --> 43:54.833
Don't come back,
unless you can help.

44:46.917 --> 44:47.958
Good morning.

44:48.667 --> 44:49.833
Look who it is!

44:49.958 --> 44:51.958
Welcome, Master Lluís.

44:52.542 --> 44:53.958
Come and see.

44:54.125 --> 44:57.417
Try one of the loaves,
they're still warm.

44:57.583 --> 45:00.208
You lot keep working.

45:01.417 --> 45:02.542
What did I tell you?

45:03.208 --> 45:06.708
I told you she'd make us pay
for the favour.

45:06.917 --> 45:10.542
Be quiet,
and let the lieutenant explain.

45:10.708 --> 45:14.208
You just need to swear
that you witnessed the wedding.

45:14.667 --> 45:18.250
I'm sure that if you do,
you'll be rewarded.

45:18.792 --> 45:22.500
Do you think
she might lower the rent?

45:22.792 --> 45:25.042
She might even give you the mill.

45:25.375 --> 45:27.208
- Really?
- Yes.

45:27.542 --> 45:30.750
What you're asking us to do...
Is it legal?

45:31.708 --> 45:34.958
Is it legal to kill someone?
And yet it happens every day.

45:35.292 --> 45:38.167
- Because we're at war.
- Exactly.

45:38.333 --> 45:41.375
If they hadn't murdered the friars...

45:41.542 --> 45:43.708
Hold on a minute.

45:43.875 --> 45:46.708
What you're asking us to do...

45:47.167 --> 45:49.792
Could we get into trouble for it?

45:49.958 --> 45:52.250
The <i> Carlana</i> and I won't tell a soul.

45:52.417 --> 45:55.083
Why are you doing all this?

45:55.583 --> 45:58.625
Those boys could end up
on the streets.

45:58.792 --> 46:01.292
- Where they belong.
- Shut up!

46:01.458 --> 46:03.542
Don't you see he's right?

46:03.708 --> 46:07.667
Children shouldn't have to pay
for their parents' sins.

46:07.833 --> 46:08.917
That's right.

46:10.625 --> 46:12.958
You're doing the right thing.

46:14.833 --> 46:16.458
What the hell.

46:18.625 --> 46:19.833
Sign here.

46:22.250 --> 46:23.250
Put a cross.

46:30.250 --> 46:32.250
You too, come on.

46:36.208 --> 46:38.417
We'll all go to hell.

46:48.458 --> 46:50.458
María, take the boys outside.

47:09.167 --> 47:10.792
Is this what I think it is?

47:14.250 --> 47:15.667
I'm eternally grateful.

47:16.458 --> 47:18.208
I don't want gratitude.

47:20.958 --> 47:21.958
What do you want?

47:23.042 --> 47:24.375
You know.

47:27.958 --> 47:30.833
I think the situation
has affected us all.

47:32.583 --> 47:34.417
You can't be serious.

47:34.583 --> 47:36.750
I've never been more serious.

47:36.917 --> 47:37.958
You don't know me.

47:38.125 --> 47:40.042
Nobody's ever really loved you.

47:40.208 --> 47:41.500
But I'm ready to.

47:41.958 --> 47:43.125
Don't you see?

47:43.292 --> 47:46.542
I'm getting old,
and you're just starting to live.

47:46.708 --> 47:47.708
I don't care.

47:47.750 --> 47:48.917
But I do.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.417
You won't let yourself be loved.

47:53.792 --> 47:55.292
Why not?

48:16.917 --> 48:20.583
Don't tell me you did all this
just to have me as a reward.

48:24.667 --> 48:26.292
You're a good man.

48:27.958 --> 48:29.125
I wish you well.

48:30.333 --> 48:33.667
Perhaps one day, I'll be able
to help you or your son,

48:33.833 --> 48:35.167
like you helped mine.

48:35.333 --> 48:36.583
How do you know I have a son?

48:36.750 --> 48:40.792
I know you have a son with a woman,
but you're not married.

48:41.167 --> 48:43.333
I know you're a man of your word,

48:43.500 --> 48:47.042
weak, innocent
and high-minded.

48:48.292 --> 48:51.125
Although apparently
not as moral as I thought.

48:51.833 --> 48:55.083
Now go back to the village
and forget this ever happened.

48:55.250 --> 48:58.375
And marry that woman.
For the sake of your son.

48:58.542 --> 49:02.208
I didn't marry, on principle.
But I recognised my son.

49:02.375 --> 49:03.125
Look at me!

49:03.292 --> 49:06.208
Not like that sod
who turned his back on you.

49:06.708 --> 49:10.375
And thanks to you,
that sod is now my husband.

49:11.750 --> 49:15.125
You should show me some respect.
Now I really am the <i> Carlana.</i>

49:16.625 --> 49:17.625
Get out.

49:50.458 --> 49:52.042
Welcome, everyone.

49:52.292 --> 49:55.375
We thought we wouldn't
be able to celebrate this year,

49:56.042 --> 50:00.042
but thanks to the generosity
of the Lady of the Manor,

50:00.208 --> 50:04.208
we can honour our patron saint
the Virgin of Olivel.

50:06.042 --> 50:10.375
The war has brought hunger,
fear and hate,

50:10.792 --> 50:13.083
but it will never
destroy our faith

50:13.250 --> 50:15.667
in the Holy Virgin of our village.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.542
Who'd have thought it, eh, Picó?

50:30.708 --> 50:34.542
I know, Doc, but now everyone
thinks they were married.

50:34.708 --> 50:38.333
This shift in collective memory
is suspicious.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.875
It might start an epidemic.

50:41.042 --> 50:42.958
They're not stupid.

50:43.167 --> 50:45.125
They know
when to drop their trousers.

50:45.292 --> 50:47.583
I hope no one screws them.

50:48.708 --> 50:52.042
Lluís said
right from the beginning

50:52.208 --> 50:56.125
that the <i> Carlana</i> was a real lady.

50:56.292 --> 50:57.750
What do you say now?

50:57.917 --> 50:59.042
Right, Lluís?

51:00.125 --> 51:03.458
Does our lieutenant
have inside information?

51:04.708 --> 51:06.708
Gentlemen, excuse me.

51:07.417 --> 51:10.708
Anyone would think
he had a broom up his arse.

51:26.375 --> 51:29.167
She's pleased with
the favour you did her.

51:29.333 --> 51:30.333
What favour?

51:30.417 --> 51:33.542
You got her a certificate
that makes her a noble!

51:33.708 --> 51:36.375
- What makes you think that?
- She asked me too.

51:37.083 --> 51:38.625
I was tempted, I must admit.

51:38.792 --> 51:40.542
She's very persuasive.

51:40.708 --> 51:43.875
But if I wanted to buy sex,
I'd go to a whore.

51:44.042 --> 51:48.083
I never imagined you, of all people,
caught in her web.

51:48.250 --> 51:50.833
I thought you had strict morals.

51:50.958 --> 51:53.458
- You can talk!
- Yes, I can.

51:53.625 --> 51:56.667
While you were riding
horses and landed ladies,

51:56.833 --> 51:59.833
I was taking food
to Trini and Ramonet.

51:59.958 --> 52:01.500
You never miss a chance.

52:01.667 --> 52:05.208
I didn't tell her.
I love her too much to hurt her.

52:05.375 --> 52:06.708
That's so romantic.

52:06.875 --> 52:10.417
- Write to her and invite her here.
- I don't take orders from you.

52:10.583 --> 52:12.333
Invite her, or I will.

52:14.625 --> 52:16.583
- What for?
- You know what for.

52:16.750 --> 52:18.958
Picó's inviting
the wives for Christmas.

52:19.125 --> 52:22.417
- We're not married.
- Then ask her to marry you, Lluís.

52:23.875 --> 52:27.000
OK. But when they get here,
you have to disappear.

52:46.583 --> 52:48.167
Open the front door.

52:48.792 --> 52:50.375
We have a visitor.

53:05.833 --> 53:07.083
Olivella?

53:10.875 --> 53:12.042
Come in, Father.

53:12.542 --> 53:13.958
It's good to see you.

53:15.208 --> 53:16.208
Not for me.

53:16.375 --> 53:19.333
The <i> Carlán</i> treated you
like a whore,

53:19.500 --> 53:22.833
but you've managed
to live like a lady.

53:22.958 --> 53:24.125
What do you want?

53:26.417 --> 53:28.750
Your good news
has reached the front.

53:31.958 --> 53:33.083
My girl,

53:34.250 --> 53:38.292
give me two thousand
and I'll never say a word.

53:39.583 --> 53:41.958
Sundown.
I'll bring it to the sheep hut.

53:42.708 --> 53:45.292
You're making this easy,<i> Carlana.</i>

53:45.458 --> 53:47.375
Would you prefer it complicated?

53:54.083 --> 53:55.083
Fucking hell!

53:55.458 --> 53:56.708
- I never...
- Now go.

54:06.083 --> 54:07.792
Don't let the villagers see you.

54:20.042 --> 54:21.792
Fermín, do we have petrol?

54:21.958 --> 54:24.167
Yes, one of those large cans.

54:24.333 --> 54:26.458
Take the cover off the car.

54:30.167 --> 54:31.167
Bandido.

54:31.500 --> 54:32.750
Bandido.

55:44.667 --> 55:47.958
Still bad-tempered.
Just like your dead mother.

55:48.125 --> 55:51.708
If you hadn't beaten her to death,
I might've known her.

55:51.875 --> 55:55.125
We're not here to argue.
Give me the money.

55:55.292 --> 55:56.542
You've got your castle now.

55:56.708 --> 55:59.542
Yes, but I'm still
Cagorcio's daughter.

56:00.375 --> 56:01.875
What are you saying?

56:02.042 --> 56:05.417
Even though I own all this,
I'm still the daughter of a pig.

56:06.167 --> 56:10.125
I won't let you shame me.
You're Cagorcio's girl!

56:10.292 --> 56:12.625
You never had any shame, Father.

56:12.792 --> 56:14.833
Or you wouldn't have
done those things.

56:14.958 --> 56:19.417
You fucked his lordship
and bore him two bastards.

56:19.750 --> 56:21.375
Remember this trough, Father?

56:22.208 --> 56:27.667
This is where my girl washed
her cunt like a dirty whore.

56:29.375 --> 56:30.375
Get off me!

57:04.750 --> 57:06.083
Do it.

58:24.792 --> 58:27.542
Look, there's Daddy!

58:42.333 --> 58:43.417
Lluís.

58:43.667 --> 58:44.708
Lluís.

58:49.875 --> 58:51.958
I thought
I'd never hold you again.

58:55.792 --> 58:58.125
I'm sorry I didn't write more.

58:58.333 --> 58:59.958
But you wrote that last letter.

59:00.167 --> 59:02.125
Look how much he's grown.

59:07.292 --> 59:08.375
Well?

59:08.875 --> 59:11.958
- Don't you like me anymore?
- Ramonet, give Daddy a kiss.

59:17.875 --> 59:19.375
You're so big!

59:20.583 --> 59:22.208
I've missed you so much.

59:35.167 --> 59:36.667
He's asleep.

59:37.917 --> 59:40.708
I'm surprised Juli hasn't come.

59:40.875 --> 59:42.875
Nothing Juli does surprises me now.

59:43.333 --> 59:44.750
We can see him tomorrow.

59:44.917 --> 59:46.792
Forget about Juli.

01:01:01.542 --> 01:01:02.875
Sorry.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:11.917
Don't worry.

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:18.042
A year without a woman
is too long.

01:03:22.250 --> 01:03:24.958
- Tell her how beautiful she is.
- She's beautiful.

01:03:25.125 --> 01:03:27.875
So beautiful, right?

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:32.792
That's it, get up there.

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:34.042
Good.

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.875
Give her a stroke.

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:39.625
Now like a soldier.
Chest out.

01:03:39.792 --> 01:03:42.042
And give a salute, like this.

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:44.125
Now you can gallop.

01:03:51.208 --> 01:03:53.375
Sit down, dear.
I'll fetch your husband.

01:03:53.542 --> 01:03:55.875
It's fine. I'll do it.

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:57.792
Good morning!

01:03:58.333 --> 01:03:59.875
Mummy, look at me.

01:04:00.042 --> 01:04:01.542
Come and try this.

01:04:01.708 --> 01:04:02.958
Breakfast!

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:05.542
- Go and see.
- Run, like a solider!

01:04:06.792 --> 01:04:08.542
A breakfast fit for a king.

01:04:20.542 --> 01:04:21.875
There you go!

01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:25.292
Why are you all dressed up?

01:04:25.792 --> 01:04:28.167
There's a funeral
for the <i> Carlana's</i> father.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:30.125
He's dead?

01:04:30.292 --> 01:04:31.625
Yes.

01:04:32.042 --> 01:04:34.083
A terrible accident.

01:04:34.375 --> 01:04:35.375
At the front?

01:04:35.417 --> 01:04:36.417
No!

01:04:36.458 --> 01:04:40.125
He was on leave and his hut
burnt down with him inside.

01:04:41.542 --> 01:04:43.458
Don't let your milk get cold.

01:05:19.417 --> 01:05:20.500
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:40.917
Mummy, look,
it's uncle Juli milk.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:42.667
Put that back.

01:05:43.792 --> 01:05:45.292
What are you doing here?

01:05:45.792 --> 01:05:48.125
- Looking for Juli.
- Me too.

01:05:48.292 --> 01:05:49.583
He's meant to be on duty.

01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.792
This soldier
had to stand in for him.

01:05:51.958 --> 01:05:54.125
He's not here.
Tell the captain.

01:05:54.292 --> 01:05:56.625
- He already knows.
- Tell him again!

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:59.500
Does he often disappear like this?

01:05:59.667 --> 01:06:02.333
No. You know Juli,
he gets restless.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.333
But I told him we were coming.

01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.042
Seems he doesn't care.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:09.125
Lluís, did he steal
that food he brought us?

01:06:09.292 --> 01:06:12.625
Of course.
He has no respect for anything.

01:06:12.792 --> 01:06:16.250
If it wasn't for him...
Where do you think he is?

01:06:16.417 --> 01:06:17.542
I don't care.

01:06:18.250 --> 01:06:20.292
You don't care
if he's dead or alive?

01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:21.667
No, I don't.

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:24.125
And neither should you.

01:06:47.958 --> 01:06:49.208
Who's that?

01:06:49.875 --> 01:06:50.958
The <i> Carlana.</i>

01:06:51.167 --> 01:06:52.958
The Lady of the Manor.

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:54.625
Go inside the chapel.

01:07:08.375 --> 01:07:10.542
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

01:07:10.708 --> 01:07:13.458
It's nice to see you
with your family.

01:07:13.625 --> 01:07:15.458
My wife and my son.

01:07:15.833 --> 01:07:17.625
Hello. My name's Trini.

01:07:19.292 --> 01:07:20.792
I'm Olivella.

01:07:20.958 --> 01:07:23.042
And this is our son Ramonet.

01:07:24.958 --> 01:07:26.333
What a beautiful boy.

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.792
You have lovely hair.

01:07:28.958 --> 01:07:30.542
Thank you, ma'am.

01:07:34.958 --> 01:07:37.083
I can't keep them waiting.

01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:40.417
Nice to meet you.
Let's get this over with.

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:45.875
Such an elegant woman.
Don't you think, Lluís?

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:51.250
And such sadness in her eyes.

01:09:00.667 --> 01:09:03.167
María, put my mourning clothes away

01:09:03.332 --> 01:09:05.875
- and starch my coloured suits.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:09:06.042 --> 01:09:08.125
And send in Fermín. Hurry.

01:09:19.582 --> 01:09:20.582
Olivella.

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:30.292
Take this
to the mayor of Olivel.

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:32.207
It's a safe-conduct
for Christmas Eve.

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:35.167
How do I get to the other side?

01:09:35.750 --> 01:09:39.582
Tell the soldiers
you have a message for the mayor.

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:42.375
They'll recognise my car.

01:09:59.667 --> 01:10:01.542
Do you mind if I pray with you?

01:10:01.708 --> 01:10:05.208
Of course not.
We can keep each other company.

01:10:43.208 --> 01:10:47.250
All the women here feel
those daggers in their hearts.

01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:49.500
Women here and women everywhere.

01:10:49.667 --> 01:10:51.042
It's no kind of life.

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:00.042
Praying for your nephew?

01:11:01.375 --> 01:11:04.542
Every day, I pray
for the Virgin to protect him.

01:11:05.333 --> 01:11:07.875
Who are you praying for?

01:11:08.792 --> 01:11:10.708
For someone I love very much.

01:11:10.875 --> 01:11:12.458
Did he give you that stone?

01:11:12.625 --> 01:11:16.792
It's not a stone, it's a jewel.

01:11:19.042 --> 01:11:21.292
From Master Lluís?

01:11:25.167 --> 01:11:27.583
Let's have a little drink.

01:11:30.208 --> 01:11:31.750
We all pray to that virgin.

01:11:31.917 --> 01:11:34.875
Patron saint of marital
and family strife.

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.042
Have a seat.

01:11:36.375 --> 01:11:38.667
The real one
is in the <i> Carlana's</i> castle,

01:11:38.833 --> 01:11:40.750
but she keeps it locked away.

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:43.250
People don't seem to like her.

01:11:43.417 --> 01:11:45.250
She doesn't get on with anyone.

01:11:45.417 --> 01:11:47.625
She was very polite
with my husband.

01:11:47.792 --> 01:11:50.792
Because Master Lluís
looks after her horse.

01:11:52.917 --> 01:11:53.917
The horse is hers?

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:56.542
Of course,
like everything around here.

01:11:56.708 --> 01:11:58.375
Why did she give it to my husband?

01:11:58.542 --> 01:12:02.292
I don't know.
You'll have to ask him.

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:16.375
At ease!

01:12:18.625 --> 01:12:19.333
At ease.

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:21.500
And lose this queer scarf!

01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:23.417
Honour your uniform.

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:25.708
Our blood will build
a new fatherland.

01:12:26.042 --> 01:12:27.208
Yes, sir!

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:30.958
- You see all that snow?
- Yes.

01:12:31.125 --> 01:12:33.125
Look.
Where are they going?

01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:34.167
I don't know.

01:12:34.333 --> 01:12:35.958
To Africa, because they're cold.

01:12:36.167 --> 01:12:37.417
Is it cold?

01:12:37.583 --> 01:12:39.792
So cold it burns.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:42.458
Shut that
before we catch pneumonia.

01:12:42.625 --> 01:12:45.042
Come on,
or Mum will tell us off.

01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:46.750
Good lad!

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:50.208
Just like a soldier.

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:51.583
I need a poo.

01:12:52.167 --> 01:12:54.917
Go on then.
You're a big boy now.

01:12:58.292 --> 01:13:00.583
You suddenly seem much older.

01:13:02.792 --> 01:13:05.542
I'm so happy
to have you both here.

01:13:07.458 --> 01:13:09.917
- Guess what he wants for Christmas.
- What?

01:13:10.083 --> 01:13:12.083
A horse, like yours.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.083
We'll buy him three.

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:17.292
Yeah, right!
We can't even afford a toy one.

01:13:17.792 --> 01:13:19.167
I know how to get one.

01:13:23.833 --> 01:13:27.292
By the way, how did you get
such a nice horse?

01:13:28.792 --> 01:13:30.333
Picó gave it to me.

01:13:30.500 --> 01:13:33.167
The last one in the regiment.

01:13:33.333 --> 01:13:35.083
You were lucky to get it.

01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:38.083
Yes, very lucky.

01:13:38.250 --> 01:13:40.917
- Mummy, I've finished.
- I'll go.

01:15:06.125 --> 01:15:07.208
Merry Christmas.

01:15:07.833 --> 01:15:09.667
Come in!

01:16:00.958 --> 01:16:02.542
I propose a toast.

01:16:02.708 --> 01:16:04.750
Here's to our wives,

01:16:04.917 --> 01:16:09.083
who, thanks to the Captain,
are with us for this special night.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.083
Yes. To our wives!

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:15.708
I don't know how we've survived
without them.

01:16:15.875 --> 01:16:18.958
But don't think
the women here have forgotten us.

01:16:19.333 --> 01:16:24.625
Cigars from the Lady of the Manor.
For the officers.

01:16:25.583 --> 01:16:27.958
And this is especially for you.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.417
I don't know what it is.

01:16:31.042 --> 01:16:33.042
A sack of spuds.

01:16:34.583 --> 01:16:36.583
What nice boots.

01:16:36.958 --> 01:16:40.458
First the horse,
and now the boots.

01:16:40.625 --> 01:16:44.583
She must think our lieutenant
has delicate feet.

01:16:44.958 --> 01:16:48.750
And I have a gift for you.

01:16:48.917 --> 01:16:51.042
Doctor! Is it a book?

01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:54.375
The guy is
cuckolded by the third page!

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:56.875
"The Horns of Roland."

01:16:57.042 --> 01:17:01.125
No long descriptions of scenery,
just women who are always ready.

01:17:01.292 --> 01:17:02.958
Who did you get this from?

01:17:03.167 --> 01:17:06.333
- Who do you think? Soleràs.
- That bastard?

01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:09.708
He might be a bastard,
but he's still funny.

01:17:09.875 --> 01:17:11.458
Yes, he is.

01:17:11.625 --> 01:17:15.625
An officer deserting
in the middle of the night.

01:17:15.792 --> 01:17:17.833
Do you think your friend is funny?

01:17:18.542 --> 01:17:19.708
He's not my friend.

01:17:20.083 --> 01:17:22.625
I'm glad you've finally realised.

01:17:22.792 --> 01:17:24.375
He's a coward.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:27.042
He should be court-martialled.

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:29.542
But I can't deny he was clever.

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:34.208
I remember the day that
English politician came up here

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:38.083
and started criticizing everything...

01:17:38.250 --> 01:17:41.208
- What's the matter?
- I've got a sore throat.

01:17:44.250 --> 01:17:45.917
Is something wrong?

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:48.625
I think the boy has a chill.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:54.208
- You're not taking him home.
- No? Then you take him!

01:17:55.958 --> 01:17:57.583
Sorry, I don't feel well.

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:59.042
What have you done now?

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:01.833
Go easy on her.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:04.042
What's got into you?

01:18:04.208 --> 01:18:07.292
They're all talking about Juli.
He could be dead!

01:18:07.458 --> 01:18:08.958
That's enough!

01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:12.500
He's alive.
And doing as he pleases.

01:18:12.667 --> 01:18:14.292
- You've seen him?
- Yes.

01:18:14.708 --> 01:18:16.458
- Where?
- On the other side.

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:17.625
Prisoner?

01:18:19.083 --> 01:18:20.083
No.

01:18:20.250 --> 01:18:23.792
In a Fascist uniform
and aiming at us, Trini.

01:18:23.958 --> 01:18:26.167
That irresponsible liar
is now a traitor.

01:18:26.333 --> 01:18:28.250
I don't believe you.

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:30.333
It's the truth about your friend.

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:33.542
Why should I believe you,
when you've lied to me?

01:18:33.708 --> 01:18:35.292
- You know all about lying.
- What?

01:18:35.458 --> 01:18:36.625
You've betrayed me.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:39.125
It's the <i> Carlana's</i> horse.
You're her lover.

01:18:39.292 --> 01:18:41.875
- What?
- The whole village knows!

01:18:42.042 --> 01:18:43.208
It's so humiliating.

01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:45.917
Don't touch me!
Never touch me again!

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:46.750
Trini.

01:18:46.917 --> 01:18:50.250
I knew you couldn't love me
like I loved you,

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:53.958
but I never thought
you'd become a fraud and a cynic.

01:18:54.125 --> 01:18:56.500
Nothing happened.
She rejected me.

01:18:56.667 --> 01:18:58.458
So you couldn't even enjoy it?

01:18:58.625 --> 01:19:00.417
That's not what I meant.

01:19:00.583 --> 01:19:02.542
Please, let me fix this.

01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:06.083
Let's get married
and forget all this.

01:19:06.750 --> 01:19:08.083
You're asking me now?

01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:10.750
Just to clear your conscience?

01:19:10.917 --> 01:19:14.500
No, I want to start over.
Like a real family, Trini.

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:18.292
You're Ramonet's father,
and you always will be,

01:19:18.458 --> 01:19:20.958
but don't expect us to be a family.

01:19:21.333 --> 01:19:23.708
- Trini, I know...
- You don't know anything!

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:25.292
You know what hurts most?

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:27.667
How you've treated your friend.

01:19:27.833 --> 01:19:30.417
The only person who really loved me,

01:19:30.583 --> 01:19:35.500
the only one who wanted to know me
and who cared about what I needed.

01:19:36.042 --> 01:19:38.583
Go and have fun
with that bunch of drunks.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:40.833
Ramonet and I won't bother you.

01:19:40.958 --> 01:19:43.167
I'm taking him
back to Barcelona tomorrow.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:01.958
Dear Lord,

01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:05.917
thank you for allowing us
to celebrate another Christmas

01:20:06.917 --> 01:20:09.292
and for protecting us
from so much death.

01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:11.750
And thank you

01:20:11.917 --> 01:20:14.958
for allowing us friendships
and alliances

01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:17.667
in the middle of this cruel war.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:21.458
And we ask you to protect
these children, who are our future.

01:20:21.833 --> 01:20:22.833
Amen.

01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:30.125
I hope you like the dinner.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:33.250
Fascist crockery
and a Republican menu.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.167
Very appropriate, My Lady.

01:20:35.625 --> 01:20:39.625
I'm glad you could be with us
on such a special night.

01:20:40.417 --> 01:20:43.208
It's a sad time for me,
as a widow.

01:20:43.375 --> 01:20:46.250
And trapped inside enemy territory.

01:20:46.417 --> 01:20:50.083
We must stick together in hard times.
Right, Federico?

01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:51.250
But of course.

01:20:51.625 --> 01:20:54.625
Despite all we have suffered,
our strength

01:20:54.792 --> 01:20:57.833
- will bring us victory.
- God willing, Mr Mayor.

01:20:57.958 --> 01:21:00.125
He's on our side too.

01:21:00.292 --> 01:21:02.708
And that's good enough for me.

01:21:02.875 --> 01:21:06.667
I hope order is restored soon
so our villages can be reunited.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:10.458
We can't divide that which
was united by God and nature.

01:21:10.875 --> 01:21:12.958
I couldn't agree more.

01:21:13.333 --> 01:21:14.958
When this awful war is over,

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:17.958
I'll do all I can
to share my wealth.

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.583
My lands are on both sides,

01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:22.917
and although there's a river
in between,

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:26.833
there is no need
to turn our backs on each other.

01:21:30.417 --> 01:21:33.500
Here's to a bright future, My Lady.

01:22:18.125 --> 01:22:19.333
Juli!

01:22:22.417 --> 01:22:24.042
I missed you so much.

01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:25.250
Get on.

01:22:49.333 --> 01:22:50.333
Get off.

01:23:02.792 --> 01:23:04.125
What's this?

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:05.583
I don't understand.

01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:07.417
Don't judge me.

01:23:07.583 --> 01:23:10.667
Right now, I can't judge you.
But why?

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:14.250
I thought I was already dead,

01:23:14.875 --> 01:23:17.458
but I wasn't brave enough to die.

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:19.500
I feel I failed you.

01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:21.625
You've never failed me.

01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:25.792
- An advantage of being fickle.
- You never were with me.

01:23:26.458 --> 01:23:30.875
When I look at you,
I see myself reflected in your eyes.

01:23:31.167 --> 01:23:34.625
The Trini I want to be,
not the one other people want.

01:23:43.417 --> 01:23:44.500
What are you doing?

01:23:45.833 --> 01:23:46.958
Come.

01:23:47.333 --> 01:23:49.583
I want to show you the sky.

01:23:51.708 --> 01:23:54.208
The stars teach us a lot.

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.167
It's beautiful.

01:24:01.417 --> 01:24:03.917
You see those two masses?

01:24:04.917 --> 01:24:07.167
Some stars shining

01:24:07.833 --> 01:24:10.708
and dark shadows around them.

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:13.083
That's like thirst and water.

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:18.167
Right next to each other,

01:24:18.792 --> 01:24:20.875
without ever becoming one.

01:24:24.167 --> 01:24:27.667
If they did it would make
the most glorious planet.

01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:31.333
Do you know
what it would be called?

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:33.083
No.

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.250
Planet Solerasus.

01:24:37.083 --> 01:24:39.542
Waiting thousands of years

01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:43.292
for its moment of glory,
and then dying.

01:24:43.458 --> 01:24:45.583
In geology, a century
is like the blink of an eye.

01:24:45.750 --> 01:24:48.250
But we have just one instant,

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:50.542
a single flash

01:24:51.458 --> 01:24:53.083
of such uncertain glory.

01:24:55.875 --> 01:24:57.125
I came to get you.

01:24:59.875 --> 01:25:01.375
I can't.

01:25:03.125 --> 01:25:04.958
I've nothing left.

01:25:05.417 --> 01:25:07.958
You'd hate me
for what I can't give you,

01:25:08.167 --> 01:25:10.583
like I hate Lluís now.

01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:12.958
- Don't talk about Lluís.
- I can't.

01:25:13.417 --> 01:25:14.833
He humiliated me.

01:25:15.125 --> 01:25:19.375
He stopped respecting me,
but I can't stop loving him.

01:25:20.833 --> 01:25:23.167
Lluís might be weak,

01:25:23.417 --> 01:25:26.750
but he'll always take care
of you and Ramonet.

01:25:27.958 --> 01:25:29.958
So what do I do now?

01:25:31.167 --> 01:25:34.167
Remember this moment.
It's perfect.

01:25:35.708 --> 01:25:36.833
The moon,

01:25:37.958 --> 01:25:39.417
the stars,

01:25:41.250 --> 01:25:42.625
and your smile.

01:25:52.708 --> 01:25:54.292
Your smile.

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:02.792
I'll never take it off.

01:26:10.292 --> 01:26:11.292
Juli.

01:26:12.917 --> 01:26:14.625
I had it analyzed.

01:26:15.458 --> 01:26:16.458
And?

01:26:17.958 --> 01:26:19.375
It's like you.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:21.542
From another planet.

01:26:27.792 --> 01:26:28.625
Where were you?

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:30.875
I don't have to
explain myself to you.

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:33.500
Trini, not now.
Our son is sick.

01:26:35.417 --> 01:26:36.667
What's wrong with him?

01:26:37.583 --> 01:26:38.750
I don't know.

01:26:41.625 --> 01:26:43.792
He's boiling. Call the doctor.

01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:46.542
- He'll be drunk.
- Give him coffee!

01:26:59.375 --> 01:27:02.208
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.

01:27:02.958 --> 01:27:05.500
- Thank you for coming.
- Goodnight.

01:27:17.250 --> 01:27:20.167
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming. Goodnight.

01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:33.750
Fermín, close the gates.

01:28:02.958 --> 01:28:06.958
I figure you don't mind guests,
whichever side they come from.

01:28:07.125 --> 01:28:08.875
I've always had foresight.

01:28:09.375 --> 01:28:11.750
We can't leave
our destiny to chance.

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:13.708
I totally agree.

01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:16.833
More rum?

01:28:16.958 --> 01:28:18.458
Yes, thank you.

01:28:19.042 --> 01:28:21.542
I didn't expect this warm welcome.

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:24.708
You caught me in a good mood.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:29.625
That uniform suits you better.

01:28:31.417 --> 01:28:34.417
It seems these colours
also suit you.

01:28:35.958 --> 01:28:38.417
The sun always rises
in the same place.

01:28:38.583 --> 01:28:41.208
And we must turn towards it

01:28:41.375 --> 01:28:43.292
if we want to stay alive.

01:28:43.667 --> 01:28:45.417
Just like sunflowers.

01:28:49.583 --> 01:28:51.417
We've always got on.

01:28:52.333 --> 01:28:55.958
That's what I thought.
Until I realised you were using me.

01:28:56.125 --> 01:28:59.083
- Juli, we all use people.
- No, not all of us.

01:29:00.458 --> 01:29:03.417
Anyway,
you didn't do what I asked,

01:29:03.583 --> 01:29:05.958
- so we're even.
- You're wrong.

01:29:06.167 --> 01:29:07.583
You owe me.

01:29:07.875 --> 01:29:08.958
What do I owe you?

01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:11.958
Some compensation.

01:29:13.083 --> 01:29:14.083
For what?

01:29:16.042 --> 01:29:19.458
For having destroyed the honour
of the most decent man I know,

01:29:20.333 --> 01:29:24.000
and for condemning a woman
to the worst humiliation of all.

01:29:25.583 --> 01:29:26.667
What are you talking about?

01:29:26.833 --> 01:29:29.167
A false marriage certificate.

01:29:29.333 --> 01:29:30.333
Is it money you want?

01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:34.458
No, I don't want your money.

01:29:35.208 --> 01:29:36.958
Then why are you here?

01:29:39.750 --> 01:29:40.917
I want you to undress.

01:29:43.208 --> 01:29:45.625
- You must be joking.
- Not at all.

01:29:47.958 --> 01:29:51.667
I want to see
what a spider woman looks like.

01:29:52.542 --> 01:29:55.625
You think I'm going to
undress for you?

01:29:56.333 --> 01:29:58.167
We're on the same side now.

01:29:58.958 --> 01:30:00.250
I could talk.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:01.958
You know I'm good at it.

01:30:02.125 --> 01:30:03.708
Or you could be shot.

01:30:04.250 --> 01:30:05.958
Yes, maybe.

01:30:06.625 --> 01:30:10.292
Nobody would believe
a deserter and a drunk.

01:30:10.625 --> 01:30:14.708
I could spread the rumour
and sow the doubt.

01:30:15.083 --> 01:30:18.333
We both know that
to destroy a woman's reputation,

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.250
it doesn't matter
if it's gossip or gospel truth.

01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:26.625
- I'll destroy you first.
- Please try.

01:30:28.167 --> 01:30:30.000
I'm prepared to take the risk.

01:30:31.958 --> 01:30:33.125
I've nothing to lose.

01:30:34.792 --> 01:30:37.750
But you can't really say the same.

01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:43.292
So you want to humiliate me

01:30:43.667 --> 01:30:46.500
to make up for
another woman's humiliation

01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:49.125
and to restore
your friend's honour?

01:30:49.625 --> 01:30:53.500
- You think this will make it better?
- Not for them.

01:30:53.708 --> 01:30:54.792
But for me.

01:30:56.708 --> 01:30:57.958
What do you want?

01:30:58.167 --> 01:30:59.417
I told you.

01:30:59.583 --> 01:31:01.667
I want to see
what I imagine is there.

01:31:02.667 --> 01:31:04.750
The saggy tits

01:31:04.917 --> 01:31:08.833
of a woman who seems young,
but whose flesh is old.

01:31:09.250 --> 01:31:12.792
Cagorcio's daughter,
"the dirty pig".

01:31:15.083 --> 01:31:17.375
That's what I want to see.

01:31:20.458 --> 01:31:21.958
I'd rather die.

01:31:33.375 --> 01:31:34.708
You won't do it.

01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:36.333
Try me.

01:32:11.917 --> 01:32:12.917
And the rest.

01:32:34.958 --> 01:32:37.458
How old was I
when my father did this?

01:32:41.250 --> 01:32:42.417
Four.

01:32:44.625 --> 01:32:45.875
And this?

01:32:46.708 --> 01:32:47.708
Seventeen.

01:32:47.875 --> 01:32:50.292
I stopped counting
all the ones in between.

01:32:50.667 --> 01:32:55.333
You're not the first to treat me
like I wasn't a person.

01:33:00.833 --> 01:33:04.083
Now you know
what a spider woman looks like.

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:06.875
Does it make you feel better?

01:33:17.125 --> 01:33:20.125
Open wide.
Stick your tongue out.

01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:21.958
Say "aah"...

01:33:23.583 --> 01:33:25.250
The boy will be fine.

01:33:25.417 --> 01:33:27.917
It's an infection of the tonsils.

01:33:28.083 --> 01:33:28.792
It can't be.

01:33:28.958 --> 01:33:30.667
It causes a high fever.

01:33:30.833 --> 01:33:32.625
He had them out last year.

01:33:32.792 --> 01:33:36.292
- Are you sure?
- Of course I am. I'm his mother.

01:33:43.167 --> 01:33:45.292
Then it's not good news.

01:33:45.458 --> 01:33:46.458
What do you mean?

01:33:46.542 --> 01:33:49.167
It must be diphtheria.

01:33:49.333 --> 01:33:50.958
But children die from that.

01:33:51.167 --> 01:33:55.833
Not normally. With an antiserum,
he'd recover in a few days.

01:33:55.958 --> 01:33:58.708
But we don't have any
in our pharmacy.

01:33:58.875 --> 01:34:00.083
Are you sure?

01:34:00.250 --> 01:34:04.042
I might be drunk,
but I know what's in our pharmacy.

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:05.625
So what can we do?

01:34:08.083 --> 01:34:11.375
The Saint Paul hospital
in Barcelona might have some.

01:34:11.542 --> 01:34:13.625
I'll ask the Captain to let me go.

01:34:17.417 --> 01:34:18.625
Listen.

01:34:18.792 --> 01:34:22.042
Go now.
The boy only has a few days.

01:34:22.208 --> 01:34:25.708
Ask for Dr. Vega.
Tell him I sent you.

01:34:25.875 --> 01:34:26.917
Thank you.

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:51.917
I'm looking for Dr. Vega.

01:34:52.083 --> 01:34:54.583
Paediatrics is the third floor.

01:35:43.250 --> 01:35:44.417
Doctor Vega?

01:35:44.583 --> 01:35:46.250
Yes, that's me.

01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:48.792
Doctor Puig sent me,
from the front.

01:35:48.958 --> 01:35:52.958
My son has diphtheria
and we have no antiserum.

01:35:53.125 --> 01:35:54.958
Could you give me some?

01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:56.917
I wish I could,

01:35:57.083 --> 01:35:59.542
but we ran out a week ago.

01:36:00.250 --> 01:36:03.708
Every day, I lose
half a dozen like this.

01:36:03.875 --> 01:36:06.667
What about the other hospitals?

01:36:06.833 --> 01:36:08.667
Unfortunately not.

01:36:08.833 --> 01:36:12.042
The Fascists
aren't letting anything through.

01:36:12.208 --> 01:36:13.708
I'm sorry.

01:36:21.958 --> 01:36:23.833
Open your mouth.

01:36:23.958 --> 01:36:24.958
That's it.

01:36:25.125 --> 01:36:26.417
Swallow.

01:36:28.708 --> 01:36:30.292
He can't even drink.

01:36:30.583 --> 01:36:32.667
The fever isn't going down.

01:36:32.958 --> 01:36:34.375
He's dying.

01:36:34.917 --> 01:36:36.833
My boy is dying.

01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:47.583
Trini, we've had a telegram
from Lluís.

01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:49.917
There's no antiserum
in the Republican zone.

01:36:50.083 --> 01:36:51.708
The Fascists have it all.

01:36:51.875 --> 01:36:55.083
He says not to worry,
he'll find it somehow.

01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:58.542
He won't find any.

01:37:00.792 --> 01:37:02.542
He won't find any.

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:06.167
Please, God, don't take my boy.

01:37:07.958 --> 01:37:10.833
Don't take him from me.

01:37:14.208 --> 01:37:16.875
Please, God.

01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:23.917
Listen, Trini.
Why don't you ask the <i> Carlana?</i>

01:37:26.083 --> 01:37:27.417
The <i> Carlana?</i>

01:37:27.583 --> 01:37:28.250
Why?

01:37:28.417 --> 01:37:31.542
Because she gets on well
with both sides.

01:37:32.792 --> 01:37:34.292
And what could she do?

01:37:34.458 --> 01:37:37.500
She knows all the landlords
on the other side.

01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:41.542
Will you go?
I can't see that woman.

01:37:42.958 --> 01:37:44.583
Of course you can.

01:37:45.583 --> 01:37:46.958
And you will.

01:38:15.458 --> 01:38:17.333
I'd like to see her ladyship.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.417
Let her in, María.

01:38:23.958 --> 01:38:25.500
Is something wrong?

01:38:26.042 --> 01:38:29.292
I need to ask a favour.
It's for my son.

01:38:29.625 --> 01:38:31.292
What's wrong with him?

01:38:31.458 --> 01:38:32.625
He has diphtheria.

01:38:32.792 --> 01:38:35.583
Without an antiserum,
he'll die in a few days.

01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:37.167
I'm so sorry.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:44.250
I know you don't want to talk
to me, but I want to help.

01:38:46.458 --> 01:38:47.542
What can I do?

01:38:48.208 --> 01:38:50.375
There's no antiserum
on this side,

01:38:50.542 --> 01:38:52.500
but you know people
on the other side.

01:38:53.708 --> 01:38:55.375
Does your husband
know you're here?

01:38:55.542 --> 01:38:57.792
No, I came on my own.

01:38:59.250 --> 01:39:00.625
Tell him to come and see me.

01:39:07.375 --> 01:39:09.458
Wait here.
Switch off the lights.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:19.417
Halt!

01:39:19.583 --> 01:39:21.333
Please, don't shoot.

01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:24.833
Call Soleràs, he's with you lot.

01:39:25.625 --> 01:39:27.833
- Say his friend Lluís is here.
- Why should I?

01:39:36.042 --> 01:39:37.042
Wait here.

01:39:51.792 --> 01:39:52.792
What do you want?

01:39:55.042 --> 01:39:57.292
- It's Ramonet.
- What about Ramonet?

01:39:58.042 --> 01:39:59.083
He has diphtheria.

01:39:59.250 --> 01:40:00.250
What?

01:40:00.333 --> 01:40:02.167
He doesn't have long.

01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:04.833
We don't have any antiserum.

01:40:05.250 --> 01:40:07.875
- I thought maybe you...
- Me?

01:40:08.375 --> 01:40:11.042
What can I do?
We have nothing either.

01:40:15.917 --> 01:40:18.750
But I'll check
with the other regiments.

01:40:19.500 --> 01:40:21.958
Don't worry, Lluís. I'll find it.

01:40:23.083 --> 01:40:24.542
I hope so.

01:40:26.917 --> 01:40:30.375
Meet me tomorrow night
at the old convent.

01:40:31.750 --> 01:40:32.958
Thank you.

01:40:35.083 --> 01:40:36.167
And Trini?

01:40:38.125 --> 01:40:39.125
How is she?

01:40:39.833 --> 01:40:41.667
You can imagine.

01:40:45.708 --> 01:40:47.042
Thanks.

01:40:55.167 --> 01:40:56.167
Trini.

01:40:56.875 --> 01:40:59.042
- How is he?
- Lluís,

01:40:59.208 --> 01:41:00.542
thank God you're back.

01:41:02.458 --> 01:41:03.583
How did it go?

01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:05.750
I'll find out tonight.

01:41:05.917 --> 01:41:07.083
Is it certain?

01:41:07.250 --> 01:41:08.625
No, Trini.

01:41:08.792 --> 01:41:10.750
Then go to see the <i> Carlana.</i>

01:41:11.375 --> 01:41:13.875
The <i> Carlana?</i> Why?

01:41:14.042 --> 01:41:16.208
She'll get it, if you ask her.

01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:17.750
Did you go to her?

01:41:17.833 --> 01:41:20.583
Go, Lluís.
Don't waste more time.

01:41:34.250 --> 01:41:36.667
María, take the boys to their room.

01:41:38.375 --> 01:41:40.125
Have them wash their faces.

01:41:40.750 --> 01:41:41.833
You stay, Fermín.

01:41:44.250 --> 01:41:45.958
My wife told me to come.

01:41:47.250 --> 01:41:48.333
Hello, Lluís.

01:41:51.625 --> 01:41:53.208
Come close to the fire.

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:56.542
Have a seat.

01:42:05.083 --> 01:42:09.042
I once told you I would
be prepared to help your son.

01:42:09.583 --> 01:42:11.958
I stand by what I said.

01:42:13.583 --> 01:42:16.958
I'll get you the antiserum,
on one condition.

01:42:18.458 --> 01:42:19.458
What's that?

01:42:21.208 --> 01:42:22.583
That you kill Soleràs.

01:42:23.625 --> 01:42:24.750
What?

01:42:26.292 --> 01:42:27.292
You heard me.

01:42:28.250 --> 01:42:29.250
Why?

01:42:30.542 --> 01:42:31.958
Because he's dangerous.

01:42:32.958 --> 01:42:34.750
Don't ask me to do that.

01:42:34.958 --> 01:42:37.083
Soleràs is like a brother to me.

01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:39.792
Soleràs is just a soldier
for the other side.

01:42:40.333 --> 01:42:42.667
- We're at war.
- Give me the bloody antiserum!

01:42:42.833 --> 01:42:44.833
My son is dying!

01:42:47.667 --> 01:42:50.500
That's the deal.

01:42:51.708 --> 01:42:55.375
If you want to save your son,
you know what to do.

01:43:01.250 --> 01:43:02.667
I've never killed anyone.

01:43:03.583 --> 01:43:04.917
It's never too late.

01:43:09.042 --> 01:43:10.458
Don't I get an answer?

01:43:32.208 --> 01:43:34.125
I'm sorry, Lluís.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:36.042
I couldn't get anything.

01:43:44.667 --> 01:43:45.750
What will you do?

01:43:47.833 --> 01:43:51.250
- I've taken steps to get some.
- What steps?

01:43:57.292 --> 01:43:58.792
The <i> Carlana</i> will give it to me.

01:43:59.375 --> 01:44:00.875
The <i> Carlana?</i>

01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:03.542
In exchange for what?

01:44:04.083 --> 01:44:06.667
She doesn't give anything
away for free.

01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:10.875
Lluís.

01:44:31.458 --> 01:44:34.958
The important thing
is that Ramonet will live.

01:44:35.583 --> 01:44:37.833
- He has to live.
- And he will.

01:44:38.167 --> 01:44:40.292
His life is worth more
than either of ours.

01:44:40.458 --> 01:44:41.625
Much more.

01:44:42.875 --> 01:44:47.042
Juli, I want you to know
that despite our differences,

01:44:47.208 --> 01:44:49.542
I've always thought of you
as family.

01:44:50.417 --> 01:44:53.250
All families have a black sheep.

01:44:56.917 --> 01:44:58.417
No, it's OK.

01:45:03.042 --> 01:45:04.292
Relax.

01:45:12.333 --> 01:45:14.125
Stain it with my blood.

01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:18.125
Go, Juli.

01:45:19.125 --> 01:45:20.125
Go.

01:45:21.417 --> 01:45:23.667
Don't feel guilty, Lluís.

01:45:24.125 --> 01:45:26.083
You're doing me a favour.

01:45:27.083 --> 01:45:30.417
It's what I've always wanted:
To die.

01:45:31.125 --> 01:45:32.917
And this way, at least,

01:45:33.083 --> 01:45:35.500
my death will achieve something.

01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:39.833
Just promise you'll look after them,
and never leave them.

01:45:40.458 --> 01:45:41.458
I promise.

01:45:43.875 --> 01:45:46.958
I don't want to be buried
with the winners.

01:45:48.625 --> 01:45:52.458
A war can only end well if it's lost.

01:46:01.042 --> 01:46:02.125
Go on.

01:46:02.792 --> 01:46:03.792
I'm ready.

01:46:49.833 --> 01:46:52.333
Let's kill each other
like good brothers.

01:47:49.167 --> 01:47:50.167
Where's the antiserum?

01:47:50.250 --> 01:47:52.583
I just gave it to your wife.

01:47:53.167 --> 01:47:54.750
I knew you'd do it.

01:48:34.375 --> 01:48:36.333
He seems to be getting better.

01:48:45.833 --> 01:48:47.917
When the <i> Carlana</i> came here,

01:48:48.208 --> 01:48:50.958
it felt like
the world made no sense.

01:48:52.083 --> 01:48:55.458
It's absurd that the same woman
who hurt us so much

01:48:55.625 --> 01:48:58.125
could have saved our son's life.

01:49:00.083 --> 01:49:02.583
The main thing is Ramonet is alive.

01:49:03.958 --> 01:49:05.167
He is.

01:49:06.667 --> 01:49:08.417
What about us, Lluís?

01:49:32.875 --> 01:49:34.042
They're shooting.

01:49:34.792 --> 01:49:36.625
Quickly, AGUSTÍN.

01:49:37.250 --> 01:49:39.083
It's all right.

01:49:51.583 --> 01:49:52.875
Get into bed.

01:49:56.542 --> 01:49:58.292
Go on, AGUSTÍN.

01:50:15.500 --> 01:50:17.250
Everything's all right.

01:50:17.417 --> 01:50:18.833
Go to sleep.

01:50:19.958 --> 01:50:21.167
Go to sleep.

01:50:28.792 --> 01:50:33.500
<i>They say that when the moon</i>

01:50:35.250 --> 01:50:39.958
<i>shines in the sky,</i>

01:50:41.500 --> 01:50:46.833
<i>the sun has gone away,</i>

01:50:48.250 --> 01:50:53.417
<i>because it's very sleepy.</i>

01:50:54.917 --> 01:50:59.500
<i>Slowly, slowly,</i>

01:51:01.250 --> 01:51:06.208
<i>close your eyes,</i>

01:51:06.708 --> 01:51:10.958
<i>because you, my little girl,
are the sun</i>

01:51:12.958 --> 01:51:17.917
<i>that I love the most.</i>

01:51:18.875 --> 01:51:24.833
<i>And the moon peeps through</i>

01:51:26.333 --> 01:51:32.708
<i>into the bedroom</i>

01:51:33.958 --> 01:51:41.167
<i>and tells you to go to sleep</i>

01:51:41.792 --> 01:51:47.750
<i>and not to be afraid.</i>

01:51:47.917 --> 01:51:50.958
<i>And in your sleep you play,</i>

01:51:51.167 --> 01:51:55.542
<i>you play with the stars</i>

01:51:55.708 --> 01:52:03.500
<i>and fill the sky with joy.</i>

01:52:03.667 --> 01:52:07.125
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

01:52:07.292 --> 01:52:11.208
<i>Sleep, my child.</i>

01:52:11.375 --> 01:52:15.125
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

01:52:15.292 --> 01:52:18.750
<i>rocks and caress you.</i>

01:52:18.917 --> 01:52:22.875
<i>Your mother tenderly</i>

01:52:23.042 --> 01:52:26.583
<i>rocks you</i>

01:52:34.125 --> 01:52:40.125
<i>in the bedroom.</i>

01:52:49.542 --> 01:52:55.750
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>
