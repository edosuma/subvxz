WEBVTT

00:08.533 --> 00:10.133
- LOUIE, I'M PROUD OF US.

00:10.167 --> 00:12.267
WE SET OUT TO BUILD
AN EXACT SCALE MODEL

00:12.300 --> 00:14.633
OF A NEW ORLEANS RIVERBOAT,
AND WE DID IT...

00:14.667 --> 00:17.233
SORT OF.

00:17.267 --> 00:18.700
- WHEN YOU TOLD ME YOU ENTERED

00:18.733 --> 00:20.900
A "HISTORY
OF NEW ORLEANS" CONTEST,

00:20.933 --> 00:22.833
I WAS AFRAID
YOU WOULD TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.

00:24.833 --> 00:27.167
- COME ON, LOUIE,
IT'S NOT ABOUT WINNING.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.367
IT'S ABOUT HAVING
A FEW LAUGHS WITH MY BUDDY.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.367
WHAT DID YOU LOAD
THE CANNON WITH?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.133
- THE ONE THING
THAT STRIKES FEAR

00:34.167 --> 00:36.700
INTO RIVER PIRATES
EVERYWHERE...

00:41.267 --> 00:44.133
SILLY STRING.

00:44.167 --> 00:46.900
- YOU, MY FRIEND, HAVE VISION.

00:46.933 --> 00:50.800
OVER HERE.

00:50.833 --> 00:53.200
- HI, GUYS.

00:53.233 --> 00:54.900
JUST GOT BACK
FROM ACTING CLASS.

00:54.933 --> 00:57.733
I'M GOING FOR
MY GHOST SCOUTS' DRAMA BADGE,

00:57.767 --> 01:00.500
WHICH REMINDS ME...

01:00.533 --> 01:03.233
I'M SO FURIOUS AT YOU TWO!

01:04.667 --> 01:07.533
- GOTCHA!
SEE, I'M NOT REALLY FURIOUS.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.700
I WAS JUST ACTING.

01:08.733 --> 01:11.667
- IF YOU SAY SO.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.567
- YEAH, MY TEACHER SAYS
I NEED TO WORK ON MY RAGE.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.867
IT WAS SUCH A THOUGHTFUL NOTE,
I HUGGED HER.

01:17.900 --> 01:20.267
I CAN HELP YOU OUT.

01:29.300 --> 01:32.167
- LOUIE!

01:32.200 --> 01:34.267
THAT WAS HILARIOUS!

01:34.300 --> 01:35.600
GOOD ONE!

01:45.300 --> 01:47.900
- * IF YOU MOVE
INTO A HAUNTED HOUSE *

01:47.933 --> 01:50.767
* YOU GOTTA TRY
TO WORK THINGS OUT *

01:50.800 --> 01:52.867
- * SO, IF YOU'RE LIVING
WITH A GHOST OR THREE *

01:52.900 --> 01:56.833
- * YOU GOTTA BE
ONE BIG, SEMI-SCARY FAMILY *

01:56.867 --> 01:59.267
- * DON'T KNOW
HOW WE ENDED UP THIS WAY *

01:59.300 --> 02:00.767
- * BUT I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL US *

02:00.800 --> 02:03.633
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:03.667 --> 02:06.267
* THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:06.300 --> 02:08.500
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:08.533 --> 02:12.267
*

02:12.300 --> 02:13.767
- * THE HAUNTED HATHAWAYS

02:13.800 --> 02:16.467
*

02:21.667 --> 02:23.067
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

02:23.067 --> 02:24.433
- TRAINING.
REMEMBER?

02:24.467 --> 02:25.633
I SAID I WAS GONNA DO
THAT 5K RUN.

02:25.667 --> 02:28.500
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE JOKING.

02:28.533 --> 02:31.067
- TAYLOR, FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
I AM GOING TO DO THIS.

02:31.067 --> 02:32.567
KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I HAVE

02:32.600 --> 02:34.900
A LITTLE SOMETHING
CALLED WILLPOWER.

02:34.933 --> 02:36.767
WOW. THAT BEAR CLAW
LOOKS DELICIOUS.

02:36.800 --> 02:40.700
- KEEP YOUR PAWS OFF THE CLAW.

02:40.733 --> 02:43.167
COME ON, YOU ASKED ME
TO TRAIN YOU.

02:43.200 --> 02:44.433
- YOU'RE RIGHT, RAY.
THANK YOU.

02:44.467 --> 02:46.367
- OKAY.
SUIT YOURSELF.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.800
MMM.

02:47.833 --> 02:50.233
- OKAY, NOW YOU'RE JUST RUBBING
IT IN MY FACE.

02:50.267 --> 02:51.567
- MMM.

02:51.600 --> 02:52.733
PLEASE?

02:52.767 --> 02:56.767
I'M KIDDING!
5K! WHOO-HOO!

02:56.800 --> 02:58.933
- OH, MY FRIEND BLAIR
IS ON HER WAY UP.

02:58.967 --> 03:00.967
WE HAVE TO STUDY
FOR A HUGE MATH TEST TOMORROW.

03:01.067 --> 03:02.567
- OH, I LOVE BLAIR.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.700
SHE'S GOT THE CUTEST LITTLE
SOUTHERN ACCENT.

03:04.733 --> 03:06.267
- MOM, PLEASE DO NOT IMITATE
HER ACCENT.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.467
IT'S EMBARRASSING.

03:07.500 --> 03:08.900
HEY, TAYLOR!

03:08.933 --> 03:11.233
AND, WHY,
HELLO, MISS MICHELLE.

03:11.267 --> 03:12.900
NOW, DON'T YOU LOOK
AWFUL PRETTY TODAY?

03:12.933 --> 03:16.967
OH, WHY, THANK YOU, BLAIR!

03:17.067 --> 03:21.267
I DO DECLARE, YOU ARE SIMPLY
A BARREL OF PEACH COBBLER.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.367
- MOM, YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

03:23.400 --> 03:26.700
- WELL, WHATEVER IN TARNATION
DO YOU MEAN?

03:26.733 --> 03:28.933
- OKAY, THANKS.
WE'RE GONNA STUDY NOW.

03:28.967 --> 03:30.567
- NOW, TAYLOR'S RIGHT,
MISS MICHELLE.

03:30.600 --> 03:31.933
WE'VE GOT TO FOCUS
IF WE WANT TO GROW UP

03:31.967 --> 03:33.433
TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL AS YOU.

03:33.467 --> 03:35.333
- OH!
I DO HAVE A KNACK FOR--

03:35.367 --> 03:36.800
OH, MY GOSH,

03:36.833 --> 03:38.767
I WAS SUPPOSED TO OPEN
THE BAKERY FIVE HOURS AGO.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.567
- KNEES UP, HATHAWAY!
GO, GO, GO!

03:43.867 --> 03:47.267
- OH, MY STARS!
I DIDN'T BRING ANY.

03:47.300 --> 03:50.233
NOW, ALL I HAVE HERE
IS THIS LITTLE OLD COPY

03:50.267 --> 03:52.933
OF LOVE LAKE 2:
CANOES IN THE MIST.

03:52.967 --> 03:54.833
- SHUT UP.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.533
I LOVE THE PART WHERE LUCAS
EMERGES FROM THE MIST...

03:57.567 --> 03:59.800
- IN A CANOE...
both: ON THE LAKE!

04:01.433 --> 04:04.333
- THAT IS NOT THE WAY
TO THE BAKERY.

04:06.333 --> 04:09.833
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WOULD CLASS UP THIS BOAT?

04:09.867 --> 04:12.733
A KETCHUP HOT TUB.

04:12.767 --> 04:15.733
- IT'S LIKE
WE HAVE ONE BRAIN.

04:15.767 --> 04:19.500
- PRESENTING
MS. PENELOPE PRITCHARD.

04:19.533 --> 04:22.500
- GAH!

04:22.533 --> 04:24.067
IT'S THAT CRAZY DOLL GIRL!

04:24.067 --> 04:26.933
GOT TO GO.

04:26.967 --> 04:28.667
NOT THAT I'M AFRAID
OF LITTLE GIRLS...

04:28.700 --> 04:32.433
JUST THAT ONE!

04:32.467 --> 04:35.067
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
FRANCESCA HATHAWAY.

04:35.067 --> 04:37.767
- HELLO, PENELOPE.
WHO'S THE PENGUIN?

04:37.800 --> 04:40.167
- THIS IS
OUR FAMILY BUTLER, WORDHAM.

04:40.200 --> 04:41.800
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MISS.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.767
- NO, IT'S NOT!

04:43.800 --> 04:45.500
- APOLOGIES.

04:45.533 --> 04:49.233
YOU DISGUST ME.

04:49.267 --> 04:51.667
- HA! DON'T TELL ME
YOU'RE SUBMITTING

04:51.700 --> 04:54.500
THIS GARBAGE BARGE
IN THE CONTEST.

04:54.533 --> 04:58.633
AND I WAS WORRIED
YOU'D BE A WORTHY ARCHRIVAL.

04:58.667 --> 05:00.467
- PENELOPE,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO MAKE

05:00.500 --> 05:02.867
EVERYTHING INTO A COMPETITION.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.333
- I KNOW THAT.
- WHATEVER.

05:05.367 --> 05:07.767
I'M JUST IN THIS CONTEST
TO HAVE FUN.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.633
- SO YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT WINNING

05:09.667 --> 05:11.533
THE TRIP TO NEW YORK CITY?

05:14.567 --> 05:16.600
- IF YOU BOTHERED
TO READ THE RULES,

05:16.633 --> 05:18.733
YOU'D KNOW THAT
THE FIRST PRIZE IS A SUITE

05:18.767 --> 05:21.333
AT THE ALDORF HOTEL
FOR AN ENTIRE WEEK.

05:21.367 --> 05:23.867
- I'D LOVE TO GO BACK
TO NEW YORK,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.967
VISIT SOME OLD FRIENDS...

05:26.067 --> 05:29.500
SETTLE SOME OLD SCORES.

05:29.533 --> 05:33.067
- WELL,
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

05:33.067 --> 05:36.467
WORDHAM, BLOW HER TINY MIND.

05:41.700 --> 05:45.933
A COMPLETE MODEL OF THE CITY'S
JACKSON SQUARE, CIRCA 1800.

05:45.967 --> 05:48.567
- MUST...NOT...ADMIT!

05:48.600 --> 05:50.867
OH, THAT'S AWESOME!

05:53.200 --> 05:55.167
- MY DADDY'S ARCHITECTS
ARE FINISHING

05:55.200 --> 05:57.600
THE REAL MODEL AS WE SPEAK.

05:57.633 --> 06:00.067
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, HATHA-LAME!

06:00.067 --> 06:01.900
WORDHAM, PRANCE WITH ME!

06:06.900 --> 06:08.467
*

06:11.667 --> 06:16.300
- BUT, LUCAS, WHAT IF MY CANOE
GETS LOST IN THE MIST?

06:16.333 --> 06:18.300
- NEVER FEAR, APRIL.

06:18.333 --> 06:20.633
JUST FOLLOW THE SOUND
OF MY HEARTBEAT...

06:20.667 --> 06:22.367
TO LOVE LAKE.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.733
both: AW.

06:33.500 --> 06:36.367
- DON'T YOU HAVE
A BIG MATH TEST TOMORROW?

06:36.400 --> 06:39.933
I THINK IT'S TIME TO TURN OFF
THE TV AND START STUDYING.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.233
- YEAH.

06:41.267 --> 06:42.933
RAY, I APPRECIATE YOUR ADVICE,

06:42.967 --> 06:45.733
BUT I KIND OF SEE YOU MORE
AS A PAL THAN A PARENT, SO...

06:45.767 --> 06:47.867
GOOD TALK, AMIGO.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.300
- HOLD IT!

06:49.333 --> 06:51.233
RAY IS ALSO A PARENT
IN THIS HOUSE.

06:51.267 --> 06:53.367
HIS WORD CARRIES
THE SAME AUTHORITY AS MINE.

06:53.400 --> 06:54.533
- BUT--
- YOU HEARD HIM.

06:54.567 --> 06:56.233
TV OFF, STUDY NOW.

06:56.267 --> 07:00.233
- UGH!

07:06.867 --> 07:08.767
UH, I GUESS WE NEED
TO START STUDYING.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.367
- BIGGER THINGS
ARE HAPPENING, TAYLOR.

07:10.400 --> 07:11.833
MY FRIEND GOT US TICKETS

07:11.867 --> 07:14.367
TO AN ADVANCED SCREENING
OF LOVE LAKE 3 TOMORROW!

07:15.967 --> 07:18.467
WE HAVE TO GET THERE EARLY
TO CAMP OUTSIDE FOR GOOD SEATS,

07:18.500 --> 07:20.567
AND THEN AT MIDNIGHT,
THE MOVIE STARTS!

07:21.800 --> 07:23.333
- WAIT.
MIDNIGHT?

07:23.367 --> 07:26.433
THAT'S LIKE MID...NIGHT.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.067
MY MOM WILL NEVER LET ME GO.

07:28.067 --> 07:29.567
- TAYLOR, YOU'VE GOT TO COME.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.833
EVERYONE WHO IS ANYONE
WILL BE THERE.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.900
- I WANT TO BE ANYONE.

07:33.933 --> 07:36.933
I WOULD SCALE ANY MOUNTAIN
AND CROSS ANY RIVER,

07:36.967 --> 07:40.933
BUT I MUST FIND MY WAY
TO LOVE LAKE.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.567
- THAT WAS SO APRIL.

07:50.367 --> 07:53.433
- ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE A TRIP
TO WIN AND A PENELOPE TO CRUSH.

07:53.467 --> 07:55.233
WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.933
- I THINK I KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS--

07:57.967 --> 07:59.733
YELLOW SILLY STRING.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.333
ON IT!

08:05.467 --> 08:07.733
- WOW.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.667
YOU ARE SO GONNA WIN
FIRST PLACE

08:09.700 --> 08:12.633
WITH THAT GREAT-LOOKING
RIVERBOAT.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.267
- YOU REALLY ARE A BAD ACTOR.

08:17.300 --> 08:18.700
- IT'S JUST
THAT THE PADDLE WHEEL

08:18.733 --> 08:20.333
IS MADE OUT OF FRENCH FRIES.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.967
IF IT WERE ME,

08:22.067 --> 08:24.067
I'D GO WITH BALSA WOOD POWERED
BY TWIN-ACTION PISTONS.

08:24.067 --> 08:25.933
- HOW DO YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT BOATS?

08:27.867 --> 08:30.567
NAUTICAL-ENGINEERING BADGE,
NAVAL-HISTORY BADGE,

08:30.600 --> 08:33.700
MARITIME-LAW BADGE,
ICE-DANCING BADGE.

08:33.733 --> 08:36.267
THAT'S NOT REAL!
WHO PUT THAT THERE?

08:36.300 --> 08:40.167
- MILES, HERE'S SOMETHING
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY TO YOU--

08:40.200 --> 08:42.767
KEEP TALKING.
OOH!

08:45.400 --> 08:46.733
- ARE YOU SURE
YOUR MOM WILL SAY NO?

08:46.767 --> 08:48.633
I MEAN, MAYBE SHE'S COOLER
THAN YOU THINK.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.867
- NOPE.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.667
NOW, WHY, HELLO,
MISS MICHELLE.

08:55.700 --> 08:57.933
AREN'T YOU JUST GLOWING?

08:57.967 --> 08:59.667
OH, WHY, THANK YOU--

08:59.700 --> 09:01.600
OKAY, I CAN'T. I'M TOO TIRED.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.367
I JUST RAN A 1/2 "K."

09:03.400 --> 09:04.967
NO ONE TOLD ME
HOW LONG A "K" WAS,

09:05.067 --> 09:07.500
AND I AM NOT OKAY WITH IT.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.700
- SO, MOM, LOVE LAKE 3

09:08.733 --> 09:10.467
IS OPENING--
- I KNOW.

09:10.500 --> 09:12.567
I HAD TO JOG AROUND A LINE
OF KIDS WHO WERE CAMPING OUT

09:12.600 --> 09:14.267
ON THE SIDEWALK
FOR A MIDNIGHT SCREENING.

09:14.300 --> 09:15.967
WHAT KIND OF PARENT
ALLOWS THAT?

09:16.067 --> 09:17.800
- BAD ONES.
- ONLY THE WORST.

09:20.067 --> 09:23.567
YOU THINK YOU CAN TAUNT ME,
EVIL BISCUIT?

09:28.433 --> 09:29.700
SEE YOU, GIRLS.

09:29.733 --> 09:33.967
I DO DECLARE.

09:34.067 --> 09:36.067
- YEAH, I'M NOT GONNA
ASK HER RIGHT NOW.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.067
SO HOW'D YOU CONVINCE YOUR MOM?

09:38.067 --> 09:39.900
- OH, I DIDN'T.
I ASKED DADDY.

09:39.933 --> 09:41.500
DADS ARE WAY EASIER.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.233
A FEW COMPLIMENTS,

09:43.267 --> 09:46.600
SOME PUPPY EYES, AND THEY TURN
RIGHT TO APPLE BUTTER.

09:46.633 --> 09:49.733
- TOO BAD I CAN'T DO THAT.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.600
MAYBE I CAN.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.633
BLAIR, SAVE ME
A PLACE IN LINE.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.400
TO QUOTE LUCAS,

09:55.433 --> 09:57.833
"I'M TAKING OFF MY FLOATIES
AND TAKING A CHANCE...

09:57.867 --> 09:59.633
ON ME."

10:02.667 --> 10:04.467
*

10:04.500 --> 10:07.000
- I GOT THE APP.
- OH.

10:11.900 --> 10:15.433
- SO THE BOILER IS WELDED,
THE DECKS ARE SANDED,

10:15.467 --> 10:16.933
AND THE GALLEY IS STOCKED.

10:16.967 --> 10:18.800
THEY'RE SERVING BAKED COD
TONIGHT, BY THE WAY.

10:18.833 --> 10:20.633
MMM, MMM.

10:20.667 --> 10:22.900
- I'LL DEFINITELY BEAT PENELOPE
WITH THIS BOAT.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.567
NICE WORK, SIR NERD-A-LOT.

10:27.433 --> 10:30.433
- SO I WAS THINKING DOUGHNUT
LIFE PRESERVERS WOULD--

10:30.467 --> 10:33.700
WHO LET SCOUTMASTER LAME-O
ON OUR POOP DECK?

10:33.733 --> 10:36.567
- TURNS OUT HE KNOWS A TON
ABOUT BUILDING RIVERBOATS,

10:36.600 --> 10:38.533
SO WE KIND OF STARTED
A NEW ONE.

10:38.567 --> 10:41.533
- SO YOU'RE REPLACING ME
WITH THE BORE

10:43.667 --> 10:45.700
- HOW MANY NICKNAMES
DO YOU GUYS HAVE FOR ME?

10:45.733 --> 10:48.767
- DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.733
COME ON, LOUIE,
YOU'RE WELCOME TO HELP US OUT.

10:50.767 --> 10:54.833
- THIS SECTION
NEEDS TO BE PAINTED.

10:54.867 --> 10:58.500
- IF I COULD JUST--
CAN'T SEE HERE.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.633
- AND THE STERN COULD USE
SOME SANDING.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.067
- ON IT!

11:03.867 --> 11:06.433
- HERE'S AN IDEA!
PUT A GIANT CHEESE WHEEL

11:06.467 --> 11:08.833
ON THE FRONT SO IT CAN JUMP
OVER MONSTER TRUCKS.

11:08.867 --> 11:10.367
- HEY, MILES,

11:10.400 --> 11:13.367
WE NEED TO THINK
OF A NAME FOR OUR BOAT.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.667
- WHAT ABOUT
THE LOUISIANA LADY?

11:16.700 --> 11:19.933
- THAT STINKS.
HOW ABOUT THE BRAIN CRUSHER?

11:19.967 --> 11:23.833
- I LOVE THAT!
THE LOUISIANA LADY.

11:27.633 --> 11:31.833
- I WILL NOT BE IGNORED.
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU, FRANKIE.

11:31.867 --> 11:35.467
I THOUGHT WE WERE A TEAM.
I BRING A LOT TO THE TABLE.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.933
- UM, YOU DON'T HAVE A HEAD.

11:38.967 --> 11:42.667
- I DON'T NEED A HEAD TO SEE
I'VE BEEN STABBED IN THE BACK.

11:42.700 --> 11:46.733
I'VE BEEN BETRAYED!
BETRAYED, I SAY!

11:46.767 --> 11:49.333
LOUIE, LET ME EXPLAIN.

11:49.367 --> 11:50.967
- BETRAYED!

11:56.167 --> 11:57.567
- LOUIE, I KNOW YOU ALWAYS HIDE

11:57.600 --> 11:59.100
IN THE PEACOCK
WHEN YOU'RE UPSET.

11:59.133 --> 12:01.233
COME OUT AND LET ME EXPLAIN.

12:01.267 --> 12:03.167
- THERE'S NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

12:03.200 --> 12:06.133
PLUS, I'M NOT IN HERE.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.433
- ALL RIGHT, THE HARD WAY.

12:08.467 --> 12:11.400
TICKLES, DO YOUR THING.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.400
- GAH!
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

12:16.433 --> 12:19.300
- LOOK, I NEED MY RIVERBOAT
TO BE REALLY GOOD

12:19.333 --> 12:21.500
IF I'M GONNA BEAT PENELOPE
AND WIN THAT TRIP.

12:21.533 --> 12:23.267
- AND I SUPPOSE
MILES GIVES YOU

12:23.300 --> 12:25.233
A BETTER CHANCE
AT THAT THAN I DO.

12:25.267 --> 12:28.467
- EXACTLY.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.800
- I MEAN, YOU BOTH HAVE
INDIVIDUAL STRENGTHS.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.433
HIS IS INTELLIGENCE,
AND YOURS IS...

12:33.467 --> 12:35.100
UM...

12:35.133 --> 12:36.800
UH...

12:36.833 --> 12:40.300
- LET'S NOT DO THIS!

12:40.333 --> 12:41.367
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:41.400 --> 12:43.167
I'LL MAKE MY OWN BOAT.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.667
I DON'T NEED YOU.

12:44.700 --> 12:47.767
ALL I NEED IS THIS LAMP...

12:47.800 --> 12:51.200
AND THIS CANDY DISH...

12:51.233 --> 12:52.367
AND THIS CAT.

12:53.700 --> 12:57.633
- BETRAYED, LADY MEOW MEOW!
BETRAYED!

13:01.867 --> 13:03.367
- HI, RAY.

13:03.400 --> 13:05.767
I HAVE TO THANK YOU
FOR MAKING ME STUDY.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.467
I ACED MY TEST,
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.300
- WELL, NOT ALL BECAUSE OF ME.

13:09.333 --> 13:11.333
MAYBE 90%.

13:13.533 --> 13:16.233
- AND YOU HAVE
GREAT FASHION SENSE--

13:16.267 --> 13:17.767
YOUR HATS, YOUR VESTS,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.367
YOUR GOATEE.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.233
IT TAKES ME TWO HOURS
TO TRIM IT LIKE THIS,

13:24.267 --> 13:26.567
BUT I TELL PEOPLE
IT ONLY TAKES ME ONE.

13:26.600 --> 13:27.567
SHH.

13:27.600 --> 13:30.533
OH, YOU!

13:30.567 --> 13:31.800
ANYWAY, I'M GOING TO
A MIDNIGHT MOVIE TONIGHT.

13:31.833 --> 13:33.500
THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU, RIGHT?

13:33.533 --> 13:34.733
BY THE WAY, NICE SHOES.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.667
- THANK YOU, TAYLOR.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.433
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU STUDIED HARD.

13:38.467 --> 13:40.367
YOU DESERVE TO GO HAVE FUN
WITH YOUR FRIENDS.

13:40.400 --> 13:41.600
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE--

13:41.633 --> 13:44.467
- THAT'S A GREAT STORY.
OKAY, BYE!

13:46.200 --> 13:47.800
BLAIR, I JUST GOT
THE GREEN LIGHT

13:47.833 --> 13:50.467
TO CAMP OUT
FOR THE MIDNIGHT MOVIE.

13:50.500 --> 13:52.267
FOR A MIDNIGHT MOVIE?

13:52.300 --> 13:54.233
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU PERMISSION
FOR THAT, YOUNG LADY!

13:55.733 --> 13:59.133
- I'LL ASK THE QUESTIONS.

13:59.167 --> 14:01.133
- SORRY, MOM.
RAY GAVE ME PERMISSION,

14:01.167 --> 14:05.367
AND SINCE HIS WORD CARRIES
THE SAME AUTHORITY AS YOURS...

14:08.567 --> 14:10.533
- RAY!

14:13.700 --> 14:16.067
DO I SMELL CHEESESTEAK?

14:16.100 --> 14:18.267
- I WILL ASK THE QUESTIONS!

14:18.300 --> 14:20.600
DID YOU TELL TAYLOR THAT SHE
COULD GO TO A MIDNIGHT MOVIE?

14:22.533 --> 14:24.767
- OF COURSE NOT.
AND TAYLOR KNOWS THAT.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.067
WAIT. THAT'S WHY SHE WENT
TO YOU INSTEAD OF ME.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.567
OH, SHE IS GOOD.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.100
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'VE BEEN PLAYED,

14:34.133 --> 14:36.533
BUT WE'RE GONNA GET PAYBACK.

14:36.567 --> 14:37.633
- I'M IN...

14:37.667 --> 14:39.067
BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO THINK

14:39.067 --> 14:40.700
SHE NEVER REALLY LIKED
MY GOATEE.

14:40.733 --> 14:42.467
- RAY!

14:42.500 --> 14:45.767
- IT ONLY TAKES ME AN HOUR,
YOU KNOW.

14:48.800 --> 14:52.433
*

14:52.467 --> 14:55.333
- MILES, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.267
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
PENELOPE CHOKE ON IT!

14:59.600 --> 15:02.167
- WELL, YOU MIGHT NOT NEED
TO WAIT LONG.

15:02.200 --> 15:03.500
- QUICK!
HIDE THE BOAT!

15:03.533 --> 15:05.867
- AYE AYE, CAPTAIN!

15:05.900 --> 15:08.600
FULL STEAM AHEAD!

15:08.633 --> 15:11.433
WHOO-HOO!

15:15.433 --> 15:17.467
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T
FRANCESCA HATHAW--

15:17.500 --> 15:20.500
- ARE WE REALLY DOING THIS
EVERY TIME?

15:20.533 --> 15:23.067
- JUST HERE TO CHECK OUT
THE COMPETITION...

15:23.100 --> 15:24.800
OR LACK THEREOF.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.433
- THE ONLY PLACE I'LL BE
CHECKING OUT IS NEW YORK,

15:27.467 --> 15:29.067
WHEN I WIN THAT TRIP.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.167
WELL, YOU'RE A--

15:31.200 --> 15:32.800
- A--

15:32.833 --> 15:35.100
WORDHAM, TAUNT FOR ME.

15:35.133 --> 15:39.067
- OOH, YOU GONNA LOSE, SUCKER!

15:39.100 --> 15:41.267
WAS THAT SUFFICIENT, MADAM?
- IT WAS WHAT IT WAS.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.300
LET'S JUST GO.

15:45.167 --> 15:48.067
- I FEEL SO SORRY FOR THAT GIRL.

15:49.433 --> 15:52.267
- YEAH.
SHE HAS NO REAL FRIENDS.

15:52.300 --> 15:55.100
THE ONLY PERSON SHE EVER
HANGS OUT WITH IS HER BUTLER.

15:55.133 --> 15:56.467
IT'S SAD.

15:58.233 --> 16:00.400
- I GUESS I NEVER THOUGHT
OF THAT.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.167
- CONTESTS COME AND GO,
FRANKIE,

16:02.200 --> 16:04.600
BUT THE BEST SHIP
YOU COULD EVER BUILD...

16:04.633 --> 16:06.467
IS A FRIENDSHIP.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.067
INSPIRATIONAL-SAYINGS BADGE.

16:12.833 --> 16:15.800
- * MIDNIGHT MOVIE,
MIDNIGHT MOVIE *

16:15.833 --> 16:17.733
* GONNA LIE ON A SHEET
AND CAMP ON THE STREET *

16:17.767 --> 16:20.233
* FOR A MIDNIGHT MOVIE

16:20.267 --> 16:22.400
- SO ALL READY
FOR YOUR MIDNIGHT MOVIE?

16:22.433 --> 16:24.100
HOPE YOU HAVE FUN.

16:24.133 --> 16:26.233
- WHAT KIND OF SICK, TWISTED
GAME ARE YOU PLAYING?

16:26.267 --> 16:28.100
- NO GAME.
YOU CAN GO.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.767
AND SINCE RAY GAVE PERMISSION,

16:29.800 --> 16:32.733
JUST MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW
HIS INSTRUCTIONS.

16:32.767 --> 16:35.667
- AND I ONLY HAVE ONE--
WEAR A JACKET.

16:35.700 --> 16:37.433
IT'LL KEEP YOU SAFE AND WARM.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.733
- WOW, THIS IS ACTUALLY
REALLY NICE.

16:39.767 --> 16:42.133
- AND SINCE YOU LIKED MY HAT...

16:42.167 --> 16:43.800
YEAH.

16:43.833 --> 16:45.800
- THANKS.
YOU GUYS ARE SO AWESOME.

16:47.800 --> 16:51.200
SHE'S GONNA BE EATING
THOSE WORDS.

16:51.233 --> 16:54.500
- THAT THING YOU THINK IS
A COOKIE IS ACTUALLY A COASTER.

16:56.300 --> 16:59.233
YOU DIDN'T SAY
I COULDN'T EAT COASTERS.

16:59.267 --> 17:02.200
- DIDN'T THINK I HAD TO.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.267
- YOU THOUGHT MILES COULD BUILD
A BETTER BOAT THAN I COULD?

17:08.300 --> 17:09.600
CHECK THIS OUT!

17:17.067 --> 17:18.367
IT'S ALL GOOD.

17:18.400 --> 17:21.067
I'M A GHOST--
WENT RIGHT THROUGH ME.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.700
- NOT ME.

17:25.733 --> 17:28.400
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THE HORN.

17:34.267 --> 17:38.633
OKAY, I SEE WHY
YOU PICKED MILES' SHIP.

17:38.667 --> 17:41.100
I HOPE YOU WIN
AND GET TO SEE YOUR FRIENDS.

17:42.733 --> 17:44.400
- FRIENDS.

17:44.433 --> 17:47.400
THE BEST SHIP IS FRIENDSHIP.

17:47.433 --> 17:49.333
MILES,
MAKING THIS PROJECT WITH YOU

17:49.367 --> 17:51.400
HAS BEEN
AN ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE!

17:54.133 --> 17:56.067
- PLAY ALONG.

17:56.100 --> 17:58.267
WE HAVE TO CONVINCE HIM
WE'RE MAD AT EACH OTHER.

17:58.300 --> 17:59.767
- YOU MEAN...

17:59.800 --> 18:01.533
ACT?

18:01.567 --> 18:03.733
YOU THINK I'M A NIGHTMARE?

18:03.767 --> 18:06.500
ALL YOU DID THE WHOLE TIME
WAS TALK ABOUT LOUIE!

18:06.533 --> 18:10.300
"LOUIE'S SO MUCH MORE FUN!
LOUIE'S SO MUCH COOLER!"

18:10.333 --> 18:12.567
LOUIE THIS, LOUIE THAT!

18:12.600 --> 18:16.067
LOUIE, LOUIE, LOUIE!

18:18.067 --> 18:20.100
LOUIE.

18:20.133 --> 18:23.567
- WOW.

18:23.600 --> 18:26.667
- FRANKIE, DID YOU REALLY
TELL MILES

18:26.700 --> 18:30.133
HOW MUCH COOLER AND FUN
AND MUSCULAR I AM THAN HIM?

18:30.167 --> 18:31.733
- ACTUALLY, SHE DIDN'T SAY--

18:31.767 --> 18:35.433
- I SURE DID, BUD.
MEANT EVERY WORD.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.667
NOW, WE'VE GOT A LOT TO DO
IF WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS

18:37.700 --> 18:41.133
INTO THE CRAZIEST RIVERBOAT
TO EVER JUMP MONSTER TRUCKS!

18:41.167 --> 18:42.500
- THAT'D BE AWESOME.

18:45.267 --> 18:47.600
- HEY, MILES.
NOT BAD.

18:47.633 --> 18:50.133
- THANKS.

18:50.167 --> 18:53.500
I GUESS I FINALLY FOUND A WAY
TO TAP INTO MY RAGE.

18:53.533 --> 18:56.467
IT MAKES ME SO HAPPY!

18:58.833 --> 19:01.633
- * MIDNIGHT MOVIE,
MIDNIGHT MOVIE *

19:01.667 --> 19:03.133
WHO'S READY
FOR SOME LOVE LAKE?

19:03.167 --> 19:04.800
- TAYLOR!
YOU MADE IT!

19:04.833 --> 19:06.467
- YOUR FLATTERY PLAN WORKED
SO WELL,

19:06.500 --> 19:08.333
I GOT PERMISSION
AND THIS JACKET.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.167
I ALMOST FEEL GUILTY
FOR TRICKING MY MOM...

19:11.200 --> 19:13.333
ALMOST!

19:13.367 --> 19:15.833
- GET ON IN HERE
FOR A PICTURE.

19:15.867 --> 19:18.233
all: OH!

19:20.467 --> 19:23.300
- PLEASE STEP AWAY
FROM THE TAYLOR!

19:23.333 --> 19:26.167
REPEAT, STEP AWAY!

19:26.200 --> 19:27.533
THIS IS HER MOMMY.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.233
- OH, COME ON!

19:29.267 --> 19:32.167
- YEAH, LET'S HOLD OFF
ON THAT PICTURE.

19:32.200 --> 19:35.367
- * HUSH, LITTLE TAY-TAY,
DON'T YOU CRY *

19:35.400 --> 19:39.767
* MAMA'S GONNA SING YOU
A LULLABY *

19:39.800 --> 19:40.867
- YEAH, I'M GONNA GO NOW.

19:40.900 --> 19:43.333
- TAYLOR, WAIT!
DON'T GO.

19:43.367 --> 19:46.767
YOU STILL OWE ME $20
FOR THE TICKET.

19:46.800 --> 19:50.400
- TAY, WE HEARD THE ALARM
AND CAME AS FAST AS WE COULD.

19:52.267 --> 19:55.367
- YOU TOOK MY FONDNESS OF MY OWN
GOATEE AND USED IT AGAINST ME.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
I HAD TO TAKE ACTION.

19:57.433 --> 20:00.467
- NOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO GET
HOME BEFORE THE FLARES GO OFF.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.400
- YOU WOULDN'T.

20:02.433 --> 20:04.133
- MAKE WAY, PEOPLE!

20:04.167 --> 20:05.500
- OOH.

20:05.533 --> 20:08.400
both: * MIDNIGHT MOVIE,
MIDNIGHT MOVIE *

20:08.433 --> 20:11.067
- * BAH BAH BADA BAH

20:16.400 --> 20:20.233
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS MESS?

20:20.267 --> 20:22.033
- I ADMIT,
IT'S A BIT UNUSUAL,

20:22.067 --> 20:25.300
BUT IT WAS FUN TO BUILD,
AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

20:26.833 --> 20:30.367
I BET THIS MONSTROSITY
DOESN'T EVEN WORK.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.667
- PENELOPE, DON'T HIT
THAT SWITCH!

20:49.200 --> 20:50.567
- WHOA, LEARNING IS FUN!

20:50.600 --> 20:53.300
- MY PROJECT!

20:53.333 --> 20:56.633
- THIS SHE-DEVIL
RUINED MY MODEL.

20:56.667 --> 20:59.567
IT COST $1,000
TO HAVE THIS BUILT.

21:01.233 --> 21:02.467
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BUILD
YOUR MODEL

21:02.500 --> 21:04.667
USING COMMON
HOUSEHOLD OBJECTS.

21:04.700 --> 21:06.900
- MONEY IS VERY COMMON
IN MY HOUSE.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.267
- YOU'RE DISQUALIFIED,
MISS PRITCHARD.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.300
WORDHAM!

21:12.333 --> 21:13.800
TANTRUM FOR ME!

21:15.733 --> 21:18.533
IT'S NOT FAIR! IT'S NOT FAIR!
NOT FAIR, NOT FAIR!

21:23.700 --> 21:26.300
- WELL, I THINK
OUR BOAT DID OKAY.

21:26.333 --> 21:27.733
- SORRY ABOUT THE TRIP.

21:27.767 --> 21:29.767
I KNOW YOU WANTED TO VISIT
FRIENDS IN NEW YORK.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.267
- IT'S OKAY. I ALREADY HAVE
A GOOD FRIEND RIGHT HERE.

21:44.100 --> 21:45.900
NOT ONLY DID I FINISH
ALL FIVE "K"s,

21:45.933 --> 21:48.067
I CAME IN THE TOP TEN.
- WOW!

21:48.067 --> 21:50.400
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU, MOM.
YOU DON'T EVEN LOOK TIRED.

21:50.433 --> 21:53.067
- WELL, I WORKED HARD.
I WATCHED WHAT I ATE, AND--

21:54.833 --> 21:59.733
- YOU HAD AN INCREDIBLY ATHLETIC
GHOST DOING ALL THE WORK!

21:59.767 --> 22:04.467
- AND YET I STILL WORKED UP
AN APPETITE.

22:04.500 --> 22:07.067
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
TONIGHT, SWEETIE.
