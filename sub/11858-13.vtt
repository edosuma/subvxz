WEBVTT

00:29.166 --> 00:30.583
Hey.

00:30.667 --> 00:31.750
Hey.

00:31.834 --> 00:34.709
You know, I, uh,
I got a piece of advice.

00:34.792 --> 00:38.417
I'd feel really selfish
if I didn't share it.

00:38.500 --> 00:39.959
Okay.

00:40.041 --> 00:43.750
You're supposed to picture 'em
naked when you're on the stand.

00:43.834 --> 00:45.625
If you're nervous.

00:45.709 --> 00:47.208
Oh.

00:47.291 --> 00:51.166
I would, but, um,
it's my dad, so..

00:51.250 --> 00:52.291
[chuckles]
Yeah, okay.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.667
Right.

01:00.375 --> 01:03.083
I'm Truitt, by the way.

01:03.166 --> 01:04.917
Tamyra.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.291
Everyone calls me Spider.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.625
Well, the world would be taken
over by mosquitoes and flies

01:10.709 --> 01:12.917
if it weren't
for spiders, so..

01:13.000 --> 01:14.667
Good point.

01:17.542 --> 01:19.125
Did he do that?

01:19.208 --> 01:20.709
How did you know that?

01:20.792 --> 01:22.667
'I don't even know you, but..'

01:22.750 --> 01:25.417
that makes me really wanna kick
someone's ass on your behalf.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.166
Thanks.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.750
So, why are you here?

01:30.834 --> 01:33.875
Someone said I did
something I didn't do.

01:33.959 --> 01:34.834
Oh.

01:34.917 --> 01:37.542
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

01:39.250 --> 01:42.834
So, listen, if things go well
today and, and I'm a free man

01:42.917 --> 01:46.542
and the criminal justice
system doesn't fail me..

01:46.625 --> 01:48.542
...do you want to hang out?

01:51.083 --> 01:52.500
Tamyra..

01:52.583 --> 01:53.959
They're ready for you.

01:54.041 --> 01:55.667
You're gonna be great.

01:55.750 --> 01:57.250
Be strong.

01:58.250 --> 02:01.500
Yes! Let's hang out.

02:01.583 --> 02:04.166
My name and info's on a
sticker
inside the front cover

02:04.250 --> 02:07.709
and...it was
nice
meeting you.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.250
Maybe it was good
luck
or something.

02:51.166 --> 02:52.750
Hey!

02:52.834 --> 02:54.375
Hey!

02:54.458 --> 02:56.583
What, are you guys leaving
for a long lunch?

02:56.667 --> 02:57.709
We know you?

02:57.792 --> 02:59.583
Kate Carley,
lawyer for DHS.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.125
You guys do cold jobs, right?

03:01.208 --> 03:03.709
Yeah.
Detectives Rush, Miller.

03:03.792 --> 03:07.125
So back in '98, I represented
a teenager named Tamyra Borden

03:07.208 --> 03:10.250
who was suing her piece-of-scum
father for emancipation.

03:10.333 --> 03:12.542
- Scum like how?
- Drunk.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.417
Good old Sly liked
to beat his little girl

03:14.500 --> 03:16.542
put out his cigarettes on her.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.166
So I lose.

03:18.250 --> 03:19.792
Jerk judge said
daughter's testimony

03:19.875 --> 03:21.250
wasn't evidence
enough of abuse.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.417
Three months later,
Tamyra was killed.

03:23.500 --> 03:24.834
Skull crushed in.

03:24.917 --> 03:27.542
- They put the dad away?
- No, they did not.

03:27.625 --> 03:30.875
And now, dad's brought up
on charges for his
stepdaughter.

03:30.959 --> 03:31.959
Beating her, too?

03:32.041 --> 03:33.792
Three-year-old's in a coma.

03:33.875 --> 03:35.291
I've been talking
to the assigned DA.

03:35.375 --> 03:37.542
Doing some research,
this is what I find.

03:37.625 --> 03:38.709
What is it?

03:38.792 --> 03:40.000
Social Security checks
for Tamyra Borden

03:40.083 --> 03:41.792
'cause her mother's dead.

03:41.875 --> 03:44.792
Checks were stolen and cashed
by dear old dad for six months

03:44.875 --> 03:48.625
after her death, until Uncle
Sam stopped sending them.

03:48.709 --> 03:51.000
We'll look into it.

03:51.083 --> 03:53.458
I was just out of law school.

03:53.542 --> 03:57.125
Me and her could've shared
a wardrobe, you know?

03:57.208 --> 03:58.959
Case got away from me.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.375
Got it.

04:00.458 --> 04:02.875
Just get the guy,
so I can live with myself.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.208
(John)
'Tamyra Borden, 17.'

04:43.291 --> 04:46.667
'Found under the Kensington and
Allegheny overpass, August '98.'

04:46.750 --> 04:50.250
Well, blunt-force trauma
to the skull's what killed
her.

04:50.333 --> 04:53.375
ME speculates a hammer's
the murder weapon.

04:53.458 --> 04:55.542
Original theory was,
neighborhood like that

04:55.625 --> 04:58.500
Tamyra's looking for drugs,
turning tricks, maybe.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.125
Interviewed
family,
neighbors.

05:00.208 --> 05:01.583
No one knew what she
was doing that day

05:01.667 --> 05:03.250
who she might've been with.

05:03.333 --> 05:04.750
What about friends?

05:04.834 --> 05:05.959
None in here.

05:06.041 --> 05:08.000
Sounds like Tamyra
was a loner.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.458
Mother died in Vegas in '92.

05:10.542 --> 05:12.208
She and her dad
were split by
then.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.959
Sly Borden, three counts
of public intoxication.

05:15.041 --> 05:18.333
Second conviction
for drunk driving in '01.

05:18.417 --> 05:19.875
'He said he hadn't
seen Tamyra'

05:19.959 --> 05:21.250
in a week before she died.

05:21.333 --> 05:23.500
New info on
the Social Security checks

05:23.583 --> 05:25.625
maybe her dad'll be
more cooperative.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.792
Why is it that
I'm in a crap
cell

05:32.875 --> 05:34.750
with no cable hookup?

05:34.834 --> 05:36.375
Ain't that the way?

05:36.458 --> 05:38.125
Beat your baby girl
half to death

05:38.208 --> 05:39.542
and get treated
like a scumbag.

05:39.625 --> 05:41.375
Don't come at me
with that
bullcrap.

05:41.458 --> 05:43.250
You ever heard of
innocent until
guilty?

05:43.333 --> 05:44.750
We're here to talk
about Tamyra.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.458
Where were you the
night
she was killed?

05:47.542 --> 05:53.125
In the privacy of my own home,
sleepin' off a bad day.

05:53.208 --> 05:58.083
I had no idea my little
girl
was gettin' murdered.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.834
And you were just
crippled with grief

05:59.917 --> 06:02.417
when you spent her Social
Security checks at the track.

06:05.542 --> 06:06.792
I was just trying to get by.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.333
Tamyra would've wanted that.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.375
The daughter you
physically abused?

06:10.458 --> 06:12.083
I'll bet she hated
your guts.

06:12.166 --> 06:13.625
(Will)
'That why you finished
her off, Sly?'

06:13.709 --> 06:15.667
Couldn't stand the way
she looked at you?

06:15.750 --> 06:19.750
I hadn't seen the girl in a
week
when I heard she died.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.250
And by the way,
now she is dead

06:22.333 --> 06:25.875
everybody talks
like she's some angel.

06:25.959 --> 06:26.959
You got another
version?

06:27.041 --> 06:28.709
Took after her mother.

06:28.792 --> 06:30.375
Kind of a ho.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.125
That's nice of you.

06:32.208 --> 06:34.959
I'm sayin' it wasn't me
that got her into trouble.

06:35.041 --> 06:39.583
It was herself
and her ho-ish habits.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.917
Dinner's ready.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.458
Don't yell.

06:58.834 --> 07:01.333
Here, dad.
Dinner.

07:03.417 --> 07:05.458
You can just set
it
on your lap.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.125
Ah.

07:16.542 --> 07:17.834
Whoa.

07:19.417 --> 07:21.166
So...when you were little

07:21.250 --> 07:23.583
and Grandpa Ed
had the department
store

07:23.667 --> 07:26.333
where was that?

07:29.166 --> 07:30.917
I don't know.
Downtown.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.667
I told you this
a million times.

07:33.750 --> 07:35.000
Did you ever work there?

07:35.083 --> 07:36.667
No.

07:36.750 --> 07:38.667
By the time I was old enough
to get a job

07:38.750 --> 07:40.959
the store was closing.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.667
'No customers.'

07:42.750 --> 07:44.458
Oh.

07:44.542 --> 07:46.000
Sorry.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.542
Sorry?

07:47.625 --> 07:51.291
We went from being
"Hello, Mr. Borden"

07:51.375 --> 07:53.500
to havin' our hand out
like the Mexican bums

07:53.583 --> 07:55.041
that took over our neighborhood.

07:55.125 --> 07:59.000
And there was nothin' that I
could do to get us back on
top.

07:59.083 --> 08:01.000
Just..

08:01.083 --> 08:02.417
Okay, dad.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.667
You just..

08:10.750 --> 08:12.917
...love bringing up
stuff like this.

08:15.125 --> 08:17.375
I'm a failure.

08:17.458 --> 08:18.917
I'm sorry.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.208
You're the failure!

08:21.291 --> 08:23.417
What do you do
around here, anyway? Huh?

08:23.500 --> 08:24.875
Nothing!

08:25.667 --> 08:27.500
Like a mouse!

08:29.709 --> 08:31.709
You're out?

08:31.792 --> 08:33.917
Go sit down on the couch.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.375
Who the hell are you?

08:35.458 --> 08:36.583
I said sit down
on the couch

08:36.667 --> 08:38.250
'cause her and I
are gonna walk out of here

08:38.333 --> 08:41.834
and you're just gonna watch us
leave, okay, old man?

08:49.375 --> 08:50.625
Tamyra, go wait outside.

08:50.709 --> 08:51.583
Spider?

08:51.667 --> 08:54.041
It's okay.
Wait outside.

09:11.709 --> 09:13.291
If you ever
try to see her again

09:13.375 --> 09:16.458
I'll make sure you fall down
those stairs and don't get
up.

09:39.875 --> 09:43.500
Last time I saw her.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.667
Good riddance.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.667
Spider?
What's his real name?

09:46.750 --> 09:48.333
Hell if I know.

09:48.417 --> 09:51.834
But Tamyra was writing letters
to some prisoner

09:51.917 --> 09:54.667
number blah-blah-blah
for a few months

09:54.750 --> 09:56.542
before he graced us
with his visit.

09:56.625 --> 09:58.333
And you keep this in
for ten years?

09:58.417 --> 10:02.959
Certain people could view me
in a bad light after that
story.

10:03.041 --> 10:05.417
You get a look at where he was
locked up with those letters?

10:05.500 --> 10:06.542
No.

10:06.625 --> 10:08.417
You see his car
that night?

10:08.500 --> 10:09.875
Oh, yeah.

10:09.959 --> 10:13.125
Jerk drove a Nissan Altima.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.834
That was Tamyra's slap
in my face.

10:18.458 --> 10:21.917
Havin' a boyfriend
with a Jap car.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.208
Uh-huh.

10:23.291 --> 10:26.834
Can't really say you dug
yourself out here, Sly.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.291
But thanks for seeing us.

10:28.375 --> 10:30.166
We'll be sure to stop by again.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.083
- I cannot. I can't.
- Why not?

10:37.166 --> 10:38.125
Who's the clown?

10:38.208 --> 10:40.458
Never seen him before.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.125
Friend of yours?

10:42.208 --> 10:44.166
That's the
problem
with this job.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.834
People know
where you work.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.208
Who is he?

10:47.291 --> 10:49.041
Deadbeat from
my undercover days.

10:49.125 --> 10:52.208
Ex-banger, dealer,
just got outta prison.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.750
Came looking for a second date?

10:54.834 --> 10:57.083
Kidding.
You don't date.

10:57.166 --> 11:00.125
Don't think you know so much
more about things than I do.

11:00.208 --> 11:01.709
That woman just tolerates you.

11:01.792 --> 11:06.709
Toni can handle a real man.
Not every woman can.

11:06.792 --> 11:08.250
We got a list from DMV

11:08.333 --> 11:11.458
'who owned a
'94 Nissan Altima in '98.'

11:11.542 --> 11:13.500
Don't suppose any of 'em put
down Spider as their first
name?

11:13.583 --> 11:16.542
No, but one guy
might fit the bill.

11:16.625 --> 11:18.917
Lil and Scotty are with him now.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.417
No, I'm not Spider.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.375
That guy's real name
is Truitt Leland.

11:22.458 --> 11:24.208
And he drove a car
registered to you

11:24.291 --> 11:26.208
the night he went to
Tamyra Borden's house?

11:26.291 --> 11:28.500
He used to borrow my car, yes.

11:28.583 --> 11:32.583
I used to hang out with him
when I was young and stupid.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.500
You don't keep up?

11:34.583 --> 11:36.875
Have you met him?

11:36.959 --> 11:39.667
The moment I graduated
from angry young man-dom

11:39.750 --> 11:42.583
I stopped
spending time with him.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.083
What do you know
about Tamyra?

11:45.166 --> 11:47.083
She dated Spider.

11:47.166 --> 11:49.250
Stayed at his mom's house
with us for a few weeks.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.166
Look, do I need a lawyer?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.291
I swear, I'm nothing
like that guy.

11:53.375 --> 11:55.333
Why are you protesting
so much, Elliot?

11:55.417 --> 11:56.542
God knows what he's done

11:56.625 --> 11:57.959
that I don't want to be
associated with.

11:58.041 --> 12:01.458
He have anything to
do
with Tamyra's death?

12:01.542 --> 12:03.291
When did she die?

12:03.375 --> 12:07.625
I mean, she'd stopped coming
around, but I just figured..

12:07.709 --> 12:09.625
What?

12:09.709 --> 12:11.792
That it was because of what
was going on with us..

12:11.875 --> 12:13.333
with Spider.

12:13.417 --> 12:14.750
Which was what, Elliot?

12:14.834 --> 12:17.125
Look, my parents
had a bad divorce.

12:17.208 --> 12:20.750
And I had dad issues, which
made me vulnerable to Spider.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.500
Again..

12:22.583 --> 12:24.250
...stupid kid.

12:26.041 --> 12:30.041
Truitt wrote me all these
letters and I don't know.

12:30.125 --> 12:33.000
It was nice
to get something in the mail.

12:33.083 --> 12:37.750
My mom, she used to send
postcards or whatever,
but..

12:37.834 --> 12:40.542
Yeah, Truitt's a good writer.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.000
That's my son.

12:42.083 --> 12:45.250
And he can talk his
way
out of anything, too.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.500
Hope he warned you
we're boring over here.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.000
We don't drink or
smoke or anything.

12:50.083 --> 12:51.500
No, that's great.

12:51.583 --> 12:52.875
Want some milk?

12:52.959 --> 12:54.625
Okay.

12:54.709 --> 12:57.709
Tamyra, if you ever
want
a place to stay..

12:57.792 --> 12:58.667
Oh.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.625
'We have an extra room.'

13:01.709 --> 13:04.041
I left my dad,
moved in here.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.166
We're her orphans.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.041
Trust me, there's
no better mother.

13:12.250 --> 13:13.667
Take this downstairs.

13:13.750 --> 13:15.834
It's no mom allowed.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.709
(Truitt)
'All The values
that we're taught'

13:26.792 --> 13:30.875
'are important to us,
don't mean anything anymore.'

13:30.959 --> 13:32.917
I mean, you go to school.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.125
You can't afford college,
you work hard.

13:35.208 --> 13:38.291
But some illegal immigrant
get my job.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.959
'Be honest. Go to church.
Well, I'd like to.'

13:40.041 --> 13:41.208
But my preacher
and my government

13:41.291 --> 13:42.542
are lying to me

13:42.625 --> 13:45.291
about what kind of people
they really are.

13:45.375 --> 13:48.041
But it's not like things
have ever been better.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.458
Or easier.

13:49.542 --> 13:51.834
It's the same old struggles
our parents had.

13:51.917 --> 13:53.875
What about our grandparents?

13:53.959 --> 13:55.917
My grandfather comes back
from World War II

13:56.000 --> 13:58.250
and goes to any college
he wants to on the government.

13:58.333 --> 14:00.250
I come back from Kuwait,
I'm on my own.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.834
Something's gone wrong
between that generation

14:01.917 --> 14:02.917
and this one.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.834
Big time.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.834
I think we know
what it is.

14:08.917 --> 14:12.500
It's the government's
liberal agenda.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.125
'They serve the blacks'

14:14.208 --> 14:18.166
the Jews, the Mexicans,
and the homosexuals.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.250
The white race
is under attack.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.083
(Lilly)
'You were skinheads.'

14:30.166 --> 14:33.000
Like I said,
I was lonely and lost

14:33.083 --> 14:36.625
so I hung out with Spider
and tolerated all that talk.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.959
And he was the true believer.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.625
Tamyra's
boyfriend
was a neo-Nazi

14:42.709 --> 14:45.500
and she winds up
with her skull bashed
in.

14:45.583 --> 14:48.959
I wonder if Spider
and his steel-toed boots

14:49.041 --> 14:50.125
know anything about that.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.208
Truitt Leland, summer of '98,
he spends two months

14:59.291 --> 15:02.792
at the house of corrections
for
trashing a convenience store.

15:02.875 --> 15:04.375
Owned by a Vietnamese couple.

15:04.458 --> 15:05.375
Only two months?

15:05.458 --> 15:07.083
Court called it vandalism.

15:07.166 --> 15:08.959
Not ethnic-motivated.

15:09.041 --> 15:10.458
He up to his old tricks?

15:10.542 --> 15:11.625
'Recent as '06'

15:11.709 --> 15:13.709
cops got called
to break apart a
scuffle

15:13.792 --> 15:16.458
at a White Pride
rally
he organized.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.291
No charges pressed.

15:20.083 --> 15:22.166
Speaking of which.

15:32.709 --> 15:35.333
Guess my invite
got lost in the mail.

15:35.417 --> 15:36.750
Can I help you?

15:36.834 --> 15:39.291
This is a Neighborhood Freedom
Coalition meeting.

15:39.375 --> 15:41.834
Freedom from what exactly?

15:41.917 --> 15:43.166
Philly PD.

15:43.250 --> 15:46.083
We've got a legal right
to congregate here.

15:46.166 --> 15:48.959
- What's your issue?
- Tamyra Borden.

15:49.041 --> 15:52.750
You know anything about her
gettin' her head bashed in

15:52.834 --> 15:54.834
Spider?

15:54.917 --> 15:56.959
It's Truitt.
And no, I don't.

15:57.041 --> 15:59.834
Is this your normal
potluck accessory, Spider?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.875
Again, I've got a legal right.

16:02.959 --> 16:04.083
'I have a permit.'

16:04.166 --> 16:05.834
That sets my mind at ease.

16:05.917 --> 16:10.208
Neo-Nazi roaming the streets
with a concealed weapon.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.208
Unbelievable.
The bigotry.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.625
You should know better
than anyone.

16:14.709 --> 16:16.875
'Just because we're organized
and proud of our race'

16:16.959 --> 16:19.000
doesn't mean we go around
committing murder.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.583
Tamyra was your girlfriend
when she was killed.

16:21.667 --> 16:24.250
And you've got
a history of violence.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.709
What we had was
pure and
innocent.

16:26.792 --> 16:29.500
That girl was an Aryan goddess.

16:29.583 --> 16:31.166
Is that a compliment?

16:31.250 --> 16:33.250
Oh, so you didn't
get
slap-happy on her

16:33.333 --> 16:36.000
when she decided she wasn't
into the swastika thing?

16:36.083 --> 16:38.291
What makes you think
she wasn't into it?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:51.417 --> 16:52.875
Why are you up?

16:52.959 --> 16:54.458
I couldn't sleep.

16:54.542 --> 16:56.750
Why not?

16:56.834 --> 16:59.542
Because I was
worried
you couldn't sleep.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.709
'You barely talked
to me all night.'

17:05.000 --> 17:09.041
Do you believe in,
like, the Holocaust?

17:10.208 --> 17:13.333
That it was right?

17:13.417 --> 17:15.000
No.

17:15.083 --> 17:16.583
I'm confused.

17:20.250 --> 17:21.583
Why did you talk to me

17:21.667 --> 17:24.166
that day at the courthouse?

17:24.250 --> 17:25.792
Why did you write to me?

17:28.125 --> 17:32.166
'Cause you're the most
beautiful girl I've ever
seen.

17:32.250 --> 17:33.583
That's ridiculous.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.583
I hate the way
that swastika looks.

17:42.667 --> 17:44.959
It's hate.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.959
And I just didn't
think you were like that.

17:47.041 --> 17:50.917
The swastika is
an ancient symbol for
strength.

17:51.000 --> 17:55.375
I mean to the
sun,
good luck.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.959
That's
everything
I want for you.

17:58.041 --> 18:01.500
For our people.

18:01.583 --> 18:05.250
When my dad lost his job..

18:05.333 --> 18:08.083
...that's when
he started drinking.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.625
Who'd he lose it to?

18:11.709 --> 18:14.834
'An illegal alien, right?'

18:14.917 --> 18:16.375
Yeah.

18:18.083 --> 18:23.250
He just..
He felt so useless, you know.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.667
'I could tell.'

18:26.750 --> 18:29.959
I just wish things could have
been better for him.

18:31.625 --> 18:34.542
It doesn't have
to be that way.

18:34.625 --> 18:36.959
Are you gonna help me?

18:37.041 --> 18:38.583
Are you gonna be brave?

18:50.250 --> 18:52.625
Why'd Tamyra have
to be brave?

18:52.709 --> 18:54.875
What did you
get her into?

18:54.959 --> 18:57.458
Nothing other than
defending our beliefs.

18:57.542 --> 18:59.166
And how do you do that?

18:59.250 --> 19:00.917
We abide by the law.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.333
You cops protect us so well

19:02.417 --> 19:05.000
how could we not
want to play nice?

19:05.083 --> 19:06.959
Nice.

19:07.041 --> 19:09.166
You remember prison?

19:09.250 --> 19:10.875
How would you like
that
for the rest of your
life?

19:10.959 --> 19:12.291
Unless you're going
to press charges

19:12.375 --> 19:14.166
I'm not going
anywhere with you.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.959
You know you have
no grounds to do that.

19:16.041 --> 19:18.166
Plus, I have a First Amendment
right to congregate here

19:18.250 --> 19:21.000
and that's what
I plan on doing.

19:21.083 --> 19:23.625
See ya.

19:23.709 --> 19:28.417
Hey, Spider, where'd you
get that nickname from?

19:28.500 --> 19:30.041
Wouldn't happen to do
with the skinhead tattoo

19:30.125 --> 19:33.417
you get when you kill
a black person, would it?

19:33.500 --> 19:35.208
It's 'cause I'm nocturnal.

19:42.750 --> 19:44.375
(Vera)
'He was taunting us, boss.'

19:44.458 --> 19:47.333
Jackass thinks he can hide,
but he's wrong.

19:47.417 --> 19:49.875
These are all the crime
reports
from the summer of '98.

19:49.959 --> 19:52.709
When Spider asked Tamyra
to swear her allegiance to him

19:52.792 --> 19:54.583
said he needed her
to be brave.

19:54.667 --> 19:56.250
These types can't resist
staking a claim.

19:56.333 --> 19:58.291
There's gotta be
a signature in there.

19:58.375 --> 19:59.917
A week before
Tamyra's murder

20:00.000 --> 20:02.125
there were broken windows
at a temple in South
Philly.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.750
The same at a mosque.

20:03.834 --> 20:06.625
Racist graffiti on an
African-American family home..

20:06.709 --> 20:09.500
Standard curse word stuff,
nothing distinctive.

20:09.583 --> 20:12.250
Oh, I've got something.

20:12.333 --> 20:14.625
It was flagged
as
ethnic
intimidation

20:14.709 --> 20:15.875
'cause it's a Honduran lady.

20:15.959 --> 20:18.417
This car belonged
to Nora Mariposa

20:18.500 --> 20:23.208
went missing
August 17, 1998.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.834
The day before
Tamyra was killed.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.000
There's graffiti
on the door.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.542
That a skinhead tag?

20:30.625 --> 20:33.250
I've been reading up on the
crap
these white supremacists use

20:33.333 --> 20:35.041
to justify their beliefs.

20:35.125 --> 20:36.417
(Scotty)
'That's real educational.'

20:36.500 --> 20:37.750
Oh, the internet's
overflowing with stuff.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.166
They're everywhere.

20:39.250 --> 20:42.125
The one thing they can all
agree on is this book.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.542
'"The Lightning And The Sun."'

20:43.625 --> 20:46.250
It's got a loving dedication
to Hitler himself.

20:46.333 --> 20:47.625
Isn't that sweet?

20:47.709 --> 20:51.291
That book's about using
violence
to cleanse society.

20:51.375 --> 20:55.583
And this tag is
the lightning and the sun.

20:55.667 --> 20:57.250
Nora Mariposa never turned up?

20:59.834 --> 21:01.542
But we got a witness.

21:01.625 --> 21:04.250
Nora's four-year-old son
was in the car.

21:08.709 --> 21:10.542
'You were
four years old, Miguel'

21:10.625 --> 21:13.625
when your mother went missing?

21:13.709 --> 21:15.375
Yeah. They found me
in the car

21:15.458 --> 21:17.500
but I don't remember anything.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.333
You remember this?

21:21.417 --> 21:23.625
Did you see someone
do this?

21:25.375 --> 21:26.500
Sorry.

21:26.583 --> 21:29.625
Can we show you
some other pictures?

21:29.709 --> 21:33.750
Was, uh, this guy
there that night?

21:37.291 --> 21:39.000
I don't know. Sorry.

21:59.834 --> 22:02.333
Him and her.

22:02.417 --> 22:04.208
These two?

22:04.291 --> 22:05.834
They were there
that night?

22:09.959 --> 22:11.417
<i>Ponche de goma.</i>

22:11.500 --> 22:13.000
Flat tire.

22:27.417 --> 22:29.667
<i>Hola, chica.</i>

22:33.834 --> 22:37.250
What did they do
when they got out of the
truck?

22:41.291 --> 22:43.000
Miguel?

22:44.458 --> 22:47.250
They hurt her.

22:48.500 --> 22:49.875
My mother.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.417
What are you doing?

22:58.500 --> 23:00.083
Remember I told
you to be brave?

23:01.792 --> 23:03.291
<i>Necesitas ayuda?</i>

23:03.375 --> 23:05.417
<i>Si.</i>
<i>Gracias.</i>

23:05.500 --> 23:07.834
I cannot change tire.

23:07.917 --> 23:09.125
You guys gotta
get
down here.

23:09.208 --> 23:11.041
It's going to get explosive.

23:11.125 --> 23:13.208
Spider.

23:13.291 --> 23:14.375
This is for your father.

23:33.667 --> 23:35.750
Your father, a white man

23:35.834 --> 23:38.291
lost his job
because people like this

23:38.375 --> 23:41.625
are willing
to work for nothing!

23:41.709 --> 23:43.041
Leeches!

23:44.083 --> 23:45.291
Wait. You'll kill her!

23:49.458 --> 23:50.750
No. You will.

23:52.625 --> 23:54.667
Hey, hey,
look at
me.

23:54.750 --> 23:56.500
I know that you're scared, okay?

23:56.583 --> 23:58.000
This is what it looks like

23:58.083 --> 24:02.041
when you're fighting
to get your life back,
okay?

24:02.125 --> 24:04.750
Trust me. I love you.

24:31.834 --> 24:33.333
She shot Nora.

24:35.291 --> 24:38.125
Looks like Tamyra
lost her soul to the devil.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.625
(John)
Scotty's looking
through Jane Does.

24:48.709 --> 24:49.709
So far, none of them
match Nora Mariposa.

24:49.792 --> 24:50.875
Must have hid the body.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.083
Rush and Will are in
with the girl.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.709
[cellphone rings]
Neck tat girl?

24:53.792 --> 24:55.875
She was capable of beating
Nora Mariposa to death.

24:55.959 --> 24:57.709
Could have done it to Tamyra.

24:57.792 --> 24:59.500
Stillman.

25:04.458 --> 25:08.583
The not-so-nice lady
told you to get lost, homes.

25:08.667 --> 25:12.750
I know she did,
but she needs to talk to me.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.083
How about I talk to you, sport?

25:14.166 --> 25:16.917
Man, I just need
to see my kid.

25:17.000 --> 25:18.375
Your kid?

25:18.458 --> 25:20.208
'Veronica.'

25:20.291 --> 25:21.458
My daughter.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.750
I got it.

25:25.834 --> 25:28.166
I said I got it.

25:32.834 --> 25:35.625
I told you...
we're done talking about
this.

25:35.709 --> 25:38.375
I'm not the same
person as I was.

25:38.458 --> 25:40.208
No drugs,
no playing around.

25:40.291 --> 25:42.000
I got my act together
on the inside.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.500
Good for you.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.458
She even know about me?

25:46.542 --> 25:48.250
What should I say?

25:48.333 --> 25:51.583
Dad's in prison.
Ex-banger thug?

25:51.667 --> 25:54.083
Kat, you act like
you're better than me.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.375
You forgot how we met?

25:55.458 --> 25:57.875
- I was doing my job.
- Oh.

25:57.959 --> 26:00.333
That's what
you tell yourself, huh?

26:00.417 --> 26:03.291
I've made a life
for me and her, and it
works.

26:03.375 --> 26:06.458
We got it down.
That's all she
needs.

26:06.542 --> 26:07.625
You sure about that?

26:09.834 --> 26:11.792
I leave Philly in a week.

26:11.875 --> 26:13.250
'Get away from
all the elements.'

26:13.333 --> 26:15.792
Make sure
I stay on track.

26:15.875 --> 26:18.333
Before I go..

26:18.417 --> 26:20.667
...I'd like to meet my daughter.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.917
I said no.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.875
And don't come
back here again

26:25.959 --> 26:28.500
or I'll have your sorry
ass
thrown back in jail.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.375
(Will)
'Those your kids screaming
like banshees out there?'

26:40.458 --> 26:42.542
ADD. Yeah.

26:42.625 --> 26:46.125
I guess you weren't
a diehard skinhead, huh?

26:46.208 --> 26:47.959
Love is blind.

26:48.041 --> 26:50.834
And another of those kids
has got Spider as a dad.

26:50.917 --> 26:53.375
So? You can't tell me
who to have my babies with.

26:53.458 --> 26:55.250
Four years back child support.

26:55.333 --> 26:56.500
'What is he,
ashamed of you guys?'

26:56.583 --> 26:59.333
He's a frickin' dirtbag,
is what he is.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.166
And after you did
everything for him.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.375
- Helped him kill a woman.
- Huh?

27:03.458 --> 27:05.417
(Will)
'Nora Mariposa.'

27:05.500 --> 27:08.792
We got a witness, puts you
as co-conspirator to murder

27:08.875 --> 27:11.667
'beating that woman
as she lay on the ground.'

27:11.750 --> 27:14.333
A witness?
That's impossible.

27:14.417 --> 27:15.750
It was frickin' pitch-dark.

27:17.500 --> 27:19.500
Um... You've just put yourself

27:19.583 --> 27:21.875
at the scene
of the murder, Lindsay.

27:21.959 --> 27:23.375
So, that means
you're going away.

27:23.458 --> 27:24.667
But I didn't do it.

27:24.750 --> 27:26.458
(Will)
'Who did, Lindsay?'

27:26.542 --> 27:28.333
Was it Tamyra?

27:28.417 --> 27:30.500
You've got one option
if you wanna save yourself

27:30.583 --> 27:32.667
and that's tell us
what happened.

27:32.750 --> 27:36.250
It's them...or you.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.375
Spider trusted Tamyra
that night..

27:39.458 --> 27:43.375
...which was a huge mistake.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.542
No. No.

27:48.625 --> 27:49.875
Aye, no...

27:51.959 --> 27:53.417
[gunshot]
No!

27:56.959 --> 27:58.458
Oh, my god.

28:02.750 --> 28:04.041
No..

28:12.417 --> 28:13.458
What happened?

28:13.542 --> 28:17.000
We killed the bitch.
Roadkill.

28:17.083 --> 28:18.208
Why?

28:18.291 --> 28:20.959
(Tamyra)
'No. Oh, my god.'

28:21.041 --> 28:22.625
Oh, my god.

28:22.709 --> 28:24.750
Why are you
freaking out on
me?

28:24.834 --> 28:26.333
Why did you do that?

28:26.417 --> 28:27.750
Why?

28:27.834 --> 28:29.417
(Elliot)
Spider..

28:29.500 --> 28:30.917
...you never
said
we'd do this.

28:31.041 --> 28:33.291
What did I
say,
Elliot, huh?

28:33.375 --> 28:35.917
What did I say?
I said this was
war!

28:36.000 --> 28:38.917
What do soldiers do?
What do they do, Elliot?

28:39.000 --> 28:43.041
I thought, I thought
it was about ideas or the--

28:43.125 --> 28:44.417
Ideas?

28:45.917 --> 28:47.458
What did you
think
we were doing?

28:47.542 --> 28:49.583
We have to call
an ambulance!

28:49.667 --> 28:53.333
You stupid
bitch.
She's dead.

28:53.417 --> 28:54.500
How can you be my girl

28:54.583 --> 28:56.125
when you're
acting
like this right
now?

28:56.208 --> 28:57.458
(Elliot)
'Stop!'

28:59.458 --> 29:02.458
Here's an idea. Why don't
you
help me clean this up?

29:06.458 --> 29:07.834
Help me.

29:11.875 --> 29:13.125
Teamwork.

29:13.208 --> 29:14.667
Give me a T.

29:19.875 --> 29:22.291
Wait, I told what
you wanted to know.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.667
You said it was me or them.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.500
We meant you and them.

29:26.583 --> 29:28.250
Tell us
where Spider is.

29:28.333 --> 29:30.750
- With his bitch wife.
- They took off.

29:30.834 --> 29:33.083
Do you know where
Spider might hide out?

29:33.166 --> 29:34.959
Can't you give me a break?

29:35.041 --> 29:37.375
I was kind of stupid back then.

29:37.458 --> 29:38.875
Still are, Lindsay.

29:49.709 --> 29:53.000
Think you guys are going
in the wrong direction.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.583
What? This ain't the swap meet?

29:54.667 --> 29:56.709
You're gonna wanna put that
weapon on the ground, right
now.

29:56.792 --> 29:59.000
[siren blaring]
Now!

29:59.083 --> 30:01.291
(Scotty)
'Put your weapon down,
sweetheart.'

30:01.375 --> 30:02.750
(Nick)
'Back it up.'

30:07.083 --> 30:10.208
What did you do
with Nora Mariposa's
body?

30:10.291 --> 30:11.875
You're going away
for life for that, Spider.

30:11.959 --> 30:14.917
[scoffs]
Don't care.

30:15.959 --> 30:17.291
Movement's strong inside.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.583
Good. You got somebody
to pray for you

30:19.667 --> 30:21.333
when you get the needle.

30:22.375 --> 30:23.875
- No way.
- Double murder.

30:23.959 --> 30:26.709
- Nora and Tamyra.
- I didn't do Tamyra.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.208
- She was gonna turn you in.
- She was traitor to the
cause.

30:29.291 --> 30:32.000
Something had to be done,
and you were the guy to do
it.

30:32.083 --> 30:34.166
Not with her.

30:34.250 --> 30:36.375
She was just
a little freaked out

30:36.458 --> 30:38.917
but she would've come around.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.834
Deep down,
she was with me.

30:40.917 --> 30:45.000
Hoping she'd be
your Aryan bride?

30:45.083 --> 30:48.500
Not everybody saw
my future like that.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.625
(Rayanne)
'Tamyra?'

31:08.125 --> 31:10.208
You guys were
out late last night.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.250
Are you looking
for something?

31:15.333 --> 31:17.875
No, it's okay.

31:17.959 --> 31:20.000
Honey, what's wrong?

31:20.083 --> 31:23.041
Sweetheart,
please let me help.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.792
Is it your father?

31:24.875 --> 31:27.625
No.
Please let me
out.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.917
I need to go to the police.

31:30.000 --> 31:31.166
Is someone hurt?

31:31.250 --> 31:33.000
She's dead.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.375
We killed her.

31:34.458 --> 31:36.041
Who?

31:36.125 --> 31:38.458
A woman, a Latin woman.

31:38.542 --> 31:42.375
We shot her.
Please, let me
out.

31:42.458 --> 31:44.625
Do you know what those
spic mud people niggers

31:44.709 --> 31:46.750
do to white women
like us?

31:46.834 --> 31:48.208
Ravage us.

31:48.291 --> 31:49.875
And you don't hear
about it on the news

31:49.959 --> 31:52.333
and the cops won't help.

31:52.417 --> 31:57.291
All we have is men
like my son to protect us.

31:57.375 --> 32:00.583
No, but this woman
didn't do anything
wrong.

32:00.667 --> 32:02.959
We are at war
with those people.

32:03.041 --> 32:06.667
You are either with us,
or you're against us.

32:12.458 --> 32:14.959
You can't do this.

32:15.041 --> 32:16.709
We are.

32:16.792 --> 32:19.834
It's happening
with or without you.

32:24.250 --> 32:27.417
Your mother killed
Tamyra Borden?

32:27.500 --> 32:30.291
Why are you surprised?

32:30.375 --> 32:31.834
She raised me.

32:33.458 --> 32:36.834
My mother..

32:36.917 --> 32:38.750
...is the ultimate believer.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.834
You ever heard those stories

32:49.917 --> 32:51.917
about somebody who
raises a pit bull?

32:52.000 --> 32:54.792
'Feeds 'em gunpowder and
kicks 'em to make 'em mean?'

32:54.875 --> 32:57.875
(Will)
'One day the dog
turns on 'em, attacks.'

32:57.959 --> 33:00.083
That's what
happened to you.

33:00.166 --> 33:02.333
Your little psychopath Spider

33:02.417 --> 33:04.917
told us what you did
to his girlfriend
Tamyra.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.000
He straight-cold sold you out.

33:07.083 --> 33:09.750
What did I do? I talked to
her.
Tried to reason with her.

33:09.834 --> 33:12.709
And when that didn't work,
you killed her.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.542
I would never lay my hands
on that girl.

33:15.625 --> 33:18.625
She was going to send
Spider back to jail.

33:18.709 --> 33:20.291
Your baby boy.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.959
'You wouldn't
let that happen.'

33:22.041 --> 33:24.083
Do you think I'm stupid?

33:24.166 --> 33:26.583
We think you had
someone else

33:26.667 --> 33:28.125
do your dirty work for you.

33:28.208 --> 33:31.458
'Cause somehow Tamyra got out,
and was beat to death

33:31.542 --> 33:34.208
a mile from your house.

33:34.291 --> 33:35.417
Somehow.

33:52.583 --> 33:53.542
Hey.

33:57.458 --> 34:00.083
Why aren't you upstairs
eating dinner?

34:00.166 --> 34:02.417
Elliot.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.542
Yeah?

34:04.625 --> 34:09.125
We ran away
from our parents,
and..

34:09.208 --> 34:11.792
...here we are again.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.792
We're prisoners..

34:13.875 --> 34:17.125
...living with
another crazy
man.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.375
Yeah. Spider's not
what I thought.

34:22.667 --> 34:27.959
If I could go back to the
night
that he came to get me

34:28.041 --> 34:30.959
instead of getting
in that car, I'd run away.

34:31.041 --> 34:33.000
'I'd get on
the first bus out'

34:33.083 --> 34:37.125
'and when I got out,
I'd change my name.'

34:37.208 --> 34:39.875
I'd try to always be happy.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.542
Elliot, what
are you doing?

34:47.625 --> 34:49.000
They'll kill you.

34:49.917 --> 34:52.625
You need to go.

34:52.709 --> 34:54.458
Go now. Please.

34:56.542 --> 34:58.583
Come with me.

34:58.667 --> 35:00.291
Come!

35:00.375 --> 35:02.959
Don't be scared.

35:03.041 --> 35:06.291
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you to leave..

35:06.375 --> 35:08.041
...when you first came.

35:10.417 --> 35:11.750
Go.

35:31.834 --> 35:33.500
He went after her..

35:33.583 --> 35:35.083
...ten minutes later.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.208
With a hammer.

35:36.291 --> 35:37.834
And you just let him go?

35:37.917 --> 35:40.125
You can't stop young men
on a mission.

35:40.208 --> 35:42.208
Elliot went after her
on your mission.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.875
(Will)
'You put him up to it,
Rayanne.'

35:43.959 --> 35:45.667
How'd you make him do it?

35:45.750 --> 35:47.208
Elliot didn't
believe in
killing.

35:47.291 --> 35:50.083
You don't know Elliot.

35:50.166 --> 35:53.250
He's not who he pretends to be.

35:53.333 --> 35:55.291
'He's much weaker.'

35:55.375 --> 35:58.709
Did you talk to Spider?

35:58.792 --> 36:00.709
Everything alright?

36:00.792 --> 36:04.834
(Lilly)
'Tamyra wasn't just some girl
you met a few times.'

36:04.917 --> 36:06.542
You helped her
escape from Spider.

36:06.625 --> 36:09.417
You both knew Spider
killed Nora Mariposa.

36:09.500 --> 36:12.417
And Rayanne says that's
what you did to Tamyra.

36:12.500 --> 36:17.041
What? Well, Rayanne is
a trailer trash lunatic.

36:20.625 --> 36:22.291
What is it you teach?

36:22.375 --> 36:23.625
Economics.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.417
So this is for pleasure?

36:26.500 --> 36:28.750
(Scotty)
'Ah! "The Lightning
And The Sun."'

36:28.834 --> 36:30.250
You fooled us, Elliot.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.792
You look normal enough.

36:31.875 --> 36:33.625
(Lilly)
'And Nordic mythology.'

36:33.709 --> 36:35.208
"Ben Klassen."

36:35.291 --> 36:36.709
"History Of The Illuminati."

36:36.792 --> 36:38.125
<i>"Mein Kampf."</i>

36:38.208 --> 36:39.458
You didn't stop
hanging out with Spider

36:39.542 --> 36:40.709
because of his beliefs.

36:40.792 --> 36:42.333
'Cause you two
got that in common.

36:42.417 --> 36:44.583
Do those college kids' parents
know the kind of sewage

36:44.667 --> 36:46.458
they're paying you
to teach their kids?

36:46.542 --> 36:47.834
You don't think
economics and race

36:47.917 --> 36:50.750
belong in the same classroom?

36:50.834 --> 36:52.959
This is all about money.

36:53.041 --> 36:55.458
9/11. The Jews bringing
down the towers.

36:55.542 --> 36:57.792
'The war we're fighting
right now with our white
males.'

36:57.875 --> 36:59.375
It's all to protect Israel?

36:59.458 --> 37:01.917
You really drank
the Kool-Aid, didn't you?

37:02.000 --> 37:03.041
Doesn't it nag at you, detective

37:03.125 --> 37:04.500
that you only got your job

37:04.583 --> 37:06.625
because the liberal elite
pities your race?

37:08.125 --> 37:12.083
You guys believe
in alien probes, too?

37:12.166 --> 37:14.583
The tide is turning,
detective.

37:14.667 --> 37:16.291
We are on the internet.

37:16.375 --> 37:18.166
We are funded and organized.

37:18.250 --> 37:19.959
'And politicians agree'

37:20.041 --> 37:22.667
it's time to make our
neighborhoods safe..

37:22.750 --> 37:24.208
...protect our borders.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.959
The courts agree affirmative
action is reverse racism.

37:27.041 --> 37:29.125
You wrap it up
like it ain't narrow-minded

37:29.208 --> 37:32.125
paranoid bullcrap,
but it is.

37:32.208 --> 37:34.500
Well, what's really
crazy, Elliot, is

37:34.583 --> 37:37.208
that you can say all this..

37:37.291 --> 37:38.750
...but you're Jewish.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.291
No, I'm not.

37:41.375 --> 37:45.125
(Scotty)
'No. Your mother's
Jewish, Elliot.'

37:45.208 --> 37:48.333
Makes you the most self-hating
son of a bitch I ever seen.

37:48.417 --> 37:50.333
I'm not that.

37:50.417 --> 37:51.667
Not anymore.

37:56.083 --> 38:00.166
It's 'cause of your mother
you have this way about you.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.041
It's weak.

38:02.125 --> 38:04.000
'People see it.'

38:04.083 --> 38:06.792
That's why it is..

38:06.875 --> 38:08.792
...how it is.

38:08.875 --> 38:09.917
How?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.417
Nobody respecting you.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.625
It's that sick thing in you.

38:14.709 --> 38:16.208
I don't even live
with my mother.

38:16.291 --> 38:18.792
I don't even like her.

38:18.875 --> 38:21.375
- It's only half.
- Feels like more than that.

38:21.458 --> 38:22.750
It's not.

38:23.959 --> 38:26.500
You've gotta burn it out.

38:28.750 --> 38:31.959
(Scotty)
'How'd you burn
it out, Elliot?'

38:32.041 --> 38:34.542
Killing Tamyra
for the cause?

38:34.625 --> 38:35.875
Rayanne convinced you?

38:35.959 --> 38:37.291
You're not gonna leave here

38:37.375 --> 38:38.959
and say that thing
you said, are you?

38:39.041 --> 38:42.000
Because that would be slander.
I'm a white American.

38:42.083 --> 38:43.875
Nothing less.

38:43.959 --> 38:46.083
Take her somewhere else.

38:46.166 --> 38:48.625
Wait till you're far from here.

38:48.709 --> 38:51.125
<i>(Elliot)</i>
<i>Our esteemed President</i>
<i>Theodore Roosevelt said it</i>

38:51.208 --> 38:53.917
<i>and I don't know why</i>
<i>people can't grasp this..</i>

38:54.000 --> 38:57.500
<i>"We have room</i>
<i>for but one sole loyalty</i>

38:57.583 --> 39:00.917
<i>and that is loyalty</i>
<i>to the American people."</i>

39:01.000 --> 39:02.417
Okay.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.000
I'll handle it.

39:21.291 --> 39:23.542
Tamyra was American.

39:23.625 --> 39:25.083
Your logic doesn't work.

39:25.166 --> 39:28.208
I'm talking about
the ordinary American.

39:28.291 --> 39:31.291
Your mailman,
college student, fireman.

39:31.375 --> 39:34.875
They've been wronged,
and now they're mad.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.166
<i>I didn't write</i>
<i>the rules of war.</i>

39:42.250 --> 39:45.291
<i>They've existed</i>
<i>since the dawn of time.</i>

39:45.375 --> 39:48.208
<i>Blood is spilled</i>
<i>and it wipes us clean.</i>

39:49.834 --> 39:52.875
Why'd you need
to be clean, Elliot?

39:52.959 --> 39:54.625
You could've left with her.

39:54.709 --> 39:57.625
No. She was a race traitor.

39:57.709 --> 39:59.792
Like you.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.208
And I was a soldier.

40:37.375 --> 40:40.375
It's what the true soldiers do.

40:40.458 --> 40:42.125
<i>And when the race war starts</i>

40:42.208 --> 40:44.875
<i>everyone who ever laughed</i>
<i>at me and deserted me</i>

40:44.959 --> 40:47.667
<i>will say, "He knew."</i>

40:48.792 --> 40:50.917
<i>He knew all along."</i>

41:29.792 --> 41:30.875
I had to..

41:33.667 --> 41:35.875
...to be clean.

44:28.792 --> 44:30.083
