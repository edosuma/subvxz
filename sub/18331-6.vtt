OK, people, who can tell me
what Thanksgiving is all about?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.542
Fernando.

01:24.626 --> 01:27.629
Giving thanks for all our blessings.

01:30.423 --> 01:31.382
Wrong.

01:32.967 --> 01:34.511
Thanksgiving is about me.

01:36.763 --> 01:39.307
Me hosting the perfect Thanksgiving!

01:39.390 --> 01:42.393
Which takes macrothinking, micromanaging

01:42.477 --> 01:43.770
and a little microwaving.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.524
It's gonna be a very full house,

01:47.607 --> 01:51.611
so here is your schedule
of tomorrow's activities,

01:51.694 --> 01:55.365
suggested dress code and a voucher
good for one six-minute shower.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.912
Do I really have to specify
light or dark meat right now?

02:01.538 --> 02:03.039
Of course not.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.374
You have until 4:00.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.003
Even Dad wasn't this neurotic.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.797
And he used to vacuum the fridge.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.925
OK, make fun of me if you want,

02:14.008 --> 02:15.552
but now that Dad lives in L.A.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.388
and Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky
are there too,

02:18.471 --> 02:20.140
and Joey's stuck in Vegas,

02:20.223 --> 02:24.269
this is our one chance all year
to get the whole family together.

02:24.352 --> 02:25.478
And that's why this has to be

02:25.562 --> 02:28.857
the best Thanksgiving
in the history of Thanksgivings!

02:28.940 --> 02:31.901
Ah, you are something cute
with your holiday spirit.

02:32.443 --> 02:36.156

when you tell me I'm something cute.

[plays trombone]

02:41.536 --> 02:42.954
Grandpa Danny's here!

02:43.037 --> 02:45.081
Oh! OK, let's go!

02:45.498 --> 02:47.083
Grab the sleeping chart.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.963
I'm so excited to meet
your dad and his wife.

02:52.046 --> 02:55.091
Oh, well, Teri's with her family,
but you're gonna love my dad.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.677
I haven't seen Old Man Tanner in 20 years.

02:58.636 --> 03:00.680
Now he's gonna be Older Man Tanner.

03:02.807 --> 03:05.894
I'm sure you remember,
but he's not a big fan of the Gibblers.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.856
Yeah, so nobody tell him
that I'm dating Jimmy Gibbler.

03:11.190 --> 03:13.276
In that case, call me Jimmy Gobbler.

03:15.194 --> 03:17.488
In honor of Thanksgiving, you know.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.824
OK.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.703
-Hey!
-Hey, my peeps!

03:30.668 --> 03:32.003
What's crack-a-lackin'?

03:33.296 --> 03:36.049
Yo, family fist bumps, come on.
All around.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.468
Yeah, and et cetera.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.849
-Is that your Ferrari on the sidewalk?
-True dat.

03:45.934 --> 03:48.061
Should have seen me
blazing through Fresno.

03:48.144 --> 03:50.188
This dude gives me
a look like, "Let's go",

03:50.271 --> 03:52.398
and I give him a look like, "It's on",

03:53.441 --> 03:56.444
and then I just blew the doors
right off his Prius.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.529
Up high, my posse.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.073
Yeah!

04:00.156 --> 04:01.991
And et cetera.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.205
Uh, excuse me, sir,
but have you seen our dad?

04:07.288 --> 04:08.248
Because, if you do,

04:08.331 --> 04:11.626
could you tell him that we're
very concerned about whatever this is?

04:13.711 --> 04:14.879
Most def, Steph.

04:17.465 --> 04:21.219
Excuse me. Dad, this is my boyfriend,
Doctor Matt Harmon.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.346
It's great to finally meet you, Mr Tanner.

04:23.429 --> 04:27.100
Ah. So you and Donna Jo
been getting jiggy with it?

04:29.435 --> 04:31.437
Urban Dictionary. Look it up.

04:33.481 --> 04:37.068
And Aunt Stephanie is dating
Kimmy's brother, Jimmy Gobbler.

04:39.904 --> 04:42.490
Max, we just discussed this.

04:42.573 --> 04:44.951
What? I said Gobbler, not Gibbler.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.746
You're dating a Gibbler?

Down low, home slice.

you're back in your old room.

05:08.725 --> 05:11.436
Oh, sweet! Back in the OG crib.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.772

05:17.650 --> 05:19.694

[plays trombone]

05:23.698 --> 05:25.241

You promised to stop talking about it.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.388
-Are you and Aunt Becky fighting?
-No.

05:47.472 --> 05:50.892
We're just expressing our love loudly.
That's how much we love each other.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.581
Or Alex and Nicky.
I can never tell them apart.

06:14.791 --> 06:18.544
Look, the boys brought fish tacos from
their mildly successful fish taco truck.

06:18.628 --> 06:19.712
That I paid for.

06:22.090 --> 06:25.134
Yes, which reminds us,
the refrigerator broke.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.386
So eat up before the mayo turns rancid.

I just threw up in my eyes.

12:55.024 --> 12:58.527
Funny story, I was just hoverboarding
down at the end of the pier

12:58.611 --> 13:02.156
and suddenly the icy waters of the bay
just beckoned to me,

13:02.239 --> 13:05.326
so me being the devil-may-care
dare-devil that I be,

13:06.076 --> 13:08.704
I just got all naked
and I just dived right in.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.836
Wait, you actually went skinny dipping
in the bay at night?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.087
Oh, yeah.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.965
And it was exhilarating at first,

13:20.049 --> 13:22.885
until these sketchy thug types,
they stole all my threads.

13:24.011 --> 13:27.097
So then I had to nude hoverboard
over to a nearby church

13:27.181 --> 13:29.600
and I fetched these
out of the donation bins.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.645
How do you like me now?

13:35.773 --> 13:38.817
Sorry, I was just daydreaming
about your nude hoverboarding.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.031
Hey, Dad, can Uncle Jesse crash with you?

13:44.114 --> 13:46.158
Things are a little rocky
with him and Aunt Becky.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.577
Oh, really? You wanna talk about it?

13:48.661 --> 13:49.537
No.

13:49.620 --> 13:50.955
OK, then you can crash with me.

13:54.458 --> 13:57.127
Mom, we cannot stay in our own rooms.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.921
You have to get rid of Joey's kids.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.923
Yeah, they're criminally insane.

14:01.840 --> 14:04.468
That's insulting to the criminally insane.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.347
[sighs] I know they're a handful.

14:08.430 --> 14:10.349
Tell you what, just sleep with us tonight

14:10.432 --> 14:12.726
and we'll make it
a Fuller family slumber party.

14:13.852 --> 14:15.688
Did someone say slumber party?

14:15.771 --> 14:17.273
[Joey's kids scream and cheer]

14:19.233 --> 14:20.693
[screaming continues]

14:22.319 --> 14:25.155
-[air mattress deflating]
-[DJ and Steph groan]

14:31.996 --> 14:33.455
Where is everybody?

14:33.539 --> 14:36.292
They're 90 minutes late
for the family photo.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.128
They're out having fun playing football.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.132
Sweetie, you seem a little grumpy.
Did you get any sleep last night?

14:43.215 --> 14:44.049
Well, not much.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.885
I mean, Tommy was crying,

14:45.968 --> 14:47.177
Stephanie was snoring,

14:47.261 --> 14:50.180
there were six kids getting up to pee
and the one kid who didn't.

14:54.435 --> 14:56.061
Well, you know what you need.

14:56.145 --> 15:01.734
Yeah, what I need are all 23 people to
adhere to my carefully crafted schedule.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.613
I was thinking more like a kiss.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.366
Well, that would cut into
my basting time, but...

15:09.450 --> 15:11.327
it would stop me from complaining.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.790
Happy Thanks-- What the heck?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.087
-Steve!
-Steve.

15:22.963 --> 15:24.423
Yeah, I'm Steve.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.051
What is going on here?

15:27.134 --> 15:28.218
Uh.

15:28.302 --> 15:31.221
Yeah, you tell him, Matt.
He's your best bud.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.517
Yeah, but you guys go way back.

15:36.310 --> 15:38.979
In fact... I'm gonna go wait in the car.

15:39.813 --> 15:43.817
No, what...
What we're trying to say is, um...

15:44.693 --> 15:48.864
Well... Matt and I just started dating.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.449
-No...
-Ah!

15:51.909 --> 15:53.577
...way, Jose!

15:54.453 --> 15:57.581
Wow! Isn't that great?

15:58.123 --> 16:01.752
I always thought that you guys
would make the loveliest couple.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.797
You know, we should all get together
for a really big dinner.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.006
Oh, wait, we are!

16:08.384 --> 16:11.053
You know, um...
As long as you guys are happy,

16:11.804 --> 16:12.846
I'm super cool with this.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.306
All right, I mean, besides,

16:15.057 --> 16:16.684
I am totally in love with DJ.

16:19.103 --> 16:20.229
I mean CJ.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.814
C. With a C.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.399
Not a D. And then a J.

16:26.026 --> 16:26.902
DJ.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.404
Wait.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.115
I mean CJ!

16:35.244 --> 16:36.704
He does that a lot.

16:38.956 --> 16:41.125
Hey, we're back!

16:41.208 --> 16:43.293
[DJ exclaims indistinctly]

16:45.379 --> 16:50.634
You're late! There's no time to change
for the family photo, let's go people!

16:50.718 --> 16:53.470
In the living room. Around the couch.

16:53.554 --> 16:57.099
Smallest to tallest.
Smallest to tallest, please.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.145
Keep moving, people, let's go, let's go...

17:01.228 --> 17:02.104
Move it!

17:03.105 --> 17:04.606
Guess who won the game?

17:07.860 --> 17:09.486
What... What happened to you?

17:09.570 --> 17:10.654
Life, yo.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.867
I went long and ended up deep.

17:15.993 --> 17:17.369
You know what, DJ?

17:17.911 --> 17:19.246
Mud feels good.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.425
-Excuse me.
-Whoa, get away from me, you're filthy.

17:34.595 --> 17:37.181
Bad enough having to
share a bed with you last night.

17:49.651 --> 17:51.820
Jesse, you know that's not what happened.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.498
It ain't like you ran away.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.711
OK, everyone. Gather round the couch.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.755
I'm way behind schedule.

18:09.838 --> 18:10.964
Cut it out.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.051
Ramona, that's not how you say it.

18:14.134 --> 18:16.095
It's not angry, it's playful.

18:17.054 --> 18:18.305
Let's how her, gang.

18:18.388 --> 18:23.227
[Joey's family] Cut it out!
Jinx, buy me a coke!

18:23.310 --> 18:27.815
-[overlapping chatter]
-OK, guys, I need you to focus.

18:28.565 --> 18:30.150
Is anyone even listening to me?

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
[DJ] Thanks, Dad.

18:31.860 --> 18:35.656
Jess, look at how cute his little face is!

18:35.739 --> 18:36.907
Aw.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.326
Don't you wanna adopt one of these?

18:40.577 --> 18:42.538
Oh, my gosh, are you guys adopting a baby?

18:42.621 --> 18:44.414
That's amazing!

18:44.498 --> 18:45.582
[all cheer]

18:46.416 --> 18:47.751
We're not adopting a baby.

18:47.835 --> 18:50.379
[booing]

18:50.462 --> 18:51.922
See why I didn't wanna bring this up?

18:52.005 --> 18:54.633
You think this family will take
the side of a guy who's anti-baby?

18:54.716 --> 18:56.051
[all boo]

18:56.135 --> 18:57.761
See? Now I'm the bad guy.

18:57.845 --> 18:59.346
I don't think you're a bad guy.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.014
You just hate babies.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.268
This is the last time I'm gonna ask.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.979
Line up and look happy
for crying out loud.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.398
Oh!

19:12.651 --> 19:14.236
Lewis just gave me a wet willy.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.280
[kids chatter]

19:17.531 --> 19:20.242
[indistinct conversations]

19:20.325 --> 19:21.451
OK, I give up.

19:21.535 --> 19:24.997
I am canceling the picture
and I'm not rescheduling.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.498
Your loss, people.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.837
Man, she's so uptight.
Where did she get that?

19:37.301 --> 19:39.761
What happened to my perfect Thanksgiving?

19:39.845 --> 19:42.055
Aw, come on, Deej.

19:42.139 --> 19:43.724
Today is all about family.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.309
Don't let our family ruin that.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.898
But Dad has lost his mind,

19:50.981 --> 19:52.774
Jesse and Becky won't stop bickering

19:52.858 --> 19:55.152
and Joey's family
is totally out of control.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.156
-You know what we gotta do?
-Sneak off to Olive Garden.

20:01.909 --> 20:03.327
Tempting, but not yet.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.580
First, let's try to parent the parents.

20:06.663 --> 20:10.500
OK? I'll talk to Uncle Jesse,
Deej, you get Dad,

20:10.584 --> 20:11.960
Kimmy, you get the easy job.

20:12.044 --> 20:15.255
Tell Joey his kids need to straighten up
or hit the bricks.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.803
Stephanie's right.
It is up to us to save Thanksgiving.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.473
Let's do it.

20:24.556 --> 20:26.642
Today, we're the she-turkey pack.

20:26.725 --> 20:27.601
Yeah!

20:28.644 --> 20:30.979
Come on, everybody, let's gobble-howl.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.066
[gobble-howls]

20:38.237 --> 20:41.073
Well, sure, it looks dumb
if I'm the only one doing it, come on!

20:41.156 --> 20:43.075
[gobble-howls]

20:43.158 --> 20:44.493
Get your wattle up, come on.

20:44.952 --> 20:46.703
[all gobble-howl]

20:53.252 --> 20:54.086
Dad,

20:54.628 --> 20:56.880
are you having
some kind of mid-life crisis?

20:58.131 --> 20:59.299
No.

20:59.383 --> 21:02.678
I just started acting completely
different in the middle of my life.

21:04.304 --> 21:05.138
The middle?

21:08.058 --> 21:10.811
OK, I'm having a two-thirds-life crisis.

21:11.812 --> 21:13.438
It all started last week, Deej.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.275
I was dusting
the top of my big oak bookcase,

21:16.775 --> 21:19.778
I hadn't wiped it down for, like,
three days. I know, shame on me.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.155
So, I'm standing on this stepstool

21:22.239 --> 21:24.825
and all of a sudden it gives way
and I fall to the ground,

21:24.908 --> 21:27.703
and then the solid oak bookcase
starts coming towards me,

21:27.786 --> 21:28.954
and it's gonna fall on me

21:29.037 --> 21:31.540
and I think to myself,
"You're gonna die right now,

21:31.623 --> 21:35.127
and you just spent your whole life
being a cardigan-wearing,

21:35.210 --> 21:37.045
hug-obsessed neat freak."

21:38.505 --> 21:42.092
And then I thought, "You know what?
With whatever time you've got left,

21:42.175 --> 21:43.969
you just put your pedal to the metal."

21:44.928 --> 21:45.762
Wow.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.642
That was one slow-falling bookcase.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.146
But go on.

21:54.688 --> 21:56.940
Well, luckily I was able to
get out of the way

21:57.024 --> 22:00.569
before I got impaled
by my incredibly heavy BAMPYA.

22:02.529 --> 22:07.117
Your Bay Area
Morning Personality of the Year Award?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.785
Yeah, my BAMPYA.

22:10.037 --> 22:12.748
So I got up and I went
straight to the Ferrari dealership.

22:13.623 --> 22:16.084
Yeah, about that Ferrari you bought,

22:16.168 --> 22:18.211
is that really you, Dad?

22:18.295 --> 22:20.964
Well, to tell you the truth it's a rental.

22:22.424 --> 22:25.552
And to be totally honest,
I miss my Honda Accord.

22:28.346 --> 22:29.723
[coughs violently]

22:30.849 --> 22:33.101
I hate cigars! Why am I doing this?

22:33.769 --> 22:35.312
I'm glad to hear you say that,

22:35.395 --> 22:40.567
because I miss my sweater-wearing,
Honda-loving nerd bomber dad.

22:43.361 --> 22:44.279
Me too.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.740
He was adorable.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.869
DJ, it's just been weird.

22:51.411 --> 22:52.621
I just turned 60...

22:54.081 --> 22:55.582
and I just started thinking,

22:56.291 --> 22:57.751
"What's it all about?"

22:57.834 --> 22:59.878
Oh, well, that one's easy.

23:00.587 --> 23:03.215
Everyone in this house
is here because of you.

23:04.633 --> 23:06.259
We're what it's all about.

23:08.970 --> 23:09.805
You're right.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.057
Thanks, Deej.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.186
Oh, man, I...
I want a hug so bad right now.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.021
Bring it in, Dad!

23:18.105 --> 23:19.397
[Danny] Mmm.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.649
Oh...

23:20.732 --> 23:22.526
Could I have an extra shower voucher?

23:24.194 --> 23:26.947
I got mud in places
that I didn't know mud could be.

23:35.497 --> 23:36.915
Boy, Kimmy.

23:36.998 --> 23:39.584
Your daughter's a slob!

23:42.379 --> 23:43.213
Joey,

23:44.131 --> 23:45.465
I need to say something

23:45.549 --> 23:47.425
and you're not gonna like it.

23:48.468 --> 23:52.472
But there are four people in this house
who are causing big problems.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.267
I think I know
where you're going with this.

23:55.851 --> 23:56.768
Oh.

23:56.852 --> 23:57.686
Good.

23:57.769 --> 24:02.232
Yeah, they're annoying, obnoxious,
they get on people's nerves,

24:02.315 --> 24:03.942
I'm totally with you on this one.

24:04.693 --> 24:07.612
Great, so you'll tell them
to shape up or ship out?

24:07.696 --> 24:09.239
With pleasure.

24:09.322 --> 24:12.826
I'm gonna give Jesse, Becky
and the taco twins and earful.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.579
-No, wait, that's not what I meant.
-No, don't worry.

24:15.662 --> 24:17.372
I'll do it with a funny voice,

24:17.455 --> 24:19.249
[nasal] so it won't sound so harsh.

24:19.332 --> 24:21.126
[laughs]

24:21.209 --> 24:25.839
You know what, Kimmy, you have really
blossomed into a terrific young woman.

24:25.922 --> 24:30.010
Steph and DJ
are so lucky to have you here.

24:30.093 --> 24:30.969
Aw.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.889
Joey, we are so lucky to have you here.

24:33.972 --> 24:35.140
Thanks.

24:35.223 --> 24:39.019
In fact, you and your family
can stay as long as you'd like.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.565
Kimmy, thank you so much,
the kids would love that!

24:43.648 --> 24:44.858
[both laugh]

24:45.734 --> 24:48.528
You know what?
We're gonna stay an extra week.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.530
Yes! Sounds good.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.407
[Kimmy sighs]

24:53.450 --> 24:54.409
That went well.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.165
Wait a minute, what are we doing in here?

25:01.291 --> 25:03.418
Look, Tommy likes a story
before he goes to bed

25:03.501 --> 25:07.088
-and nobody reads better than you.
-I know what you're up to.

25:07.839 --> 25:09.966
You're trying to trick me
into wanting a baby again

25:10.050 --> 25:12.886
by showing me how much I love babies,
how much babies love me

25:12.969 --> 25:14.429
and by complimenting my hair.

25:15.764 --> 25:19.184
-I didn't compliment your hair.
-I know, I keep waiting. It looks awesome.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.772
Still waiting.

25:25.440 --> 25:28.193
-OK, your hair looks awesome.
-Hair flattery will get you nowhere.

25:28.276 --> 25:29.110
Wait.

25:30.403 --> 25:32.405
Look, I know that you're stubborn,

25:32.489 --> 25:34.574
but I also know
how much you love Aunt Becky.

25:34.658 --> 25:36.159
All right? Don't forget that.

25:36.993 --> 25:37.827
Here.

25:38.620 --> 25:39.913
-Come here, kid.
-Now...

25:39.996 --> 25:41.039
use your Elvis voice.

25:41.623 --> 25:42.499
Kids love that.

25:42.582 --> 25:43.541
I know I did.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.587
The Little Engine That Could...

25:47.671 --> 25:50.298
The King knows this one by heart.
All right.

25:51.007 --> 25:54.135
[Elvis voice] Once upon a time, there was
a little itty bitty mystery train.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.846
It was going up the Hunka Hunka Hill
to get a clambake.

25:56.930 --> 25:58.515
And he said, "One for the money,

25:58.598 --> 26:00.809
I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can.

26:01.476 --> 26:02.519
Two for the show.

26:02.602 --> 26:04.771
I think I can, I think I can,
I think I can.

26:05.355 --> 26:08.858
Three to get ready and go cat, go!
Go cat go, go cat go...

26:08.942 --> 26:10.193
Ha ha!

26:10.944 --> 26:12.362
I love that story.

26:12.445 --> 26:14.364
[in Elvis voice]
Well, thank you very much.

26:16.533 --> 26:20.495
Jess, I was talking to Stephanie and...
maybe you're right.

26:20.579 --> 26:22.497
[normal voice]
Well, I like where this is going.

26:23.832 --> 26:27.043
You raised two boys with me
and three girls with Danny and Joey.

26:27.627 --> 26:30.463
You deserve to retire from diaper duty.

26:30.547 --> 26:31.589
What's the catch?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.925
Jess, I didn't wanna just
raise another child,

26:34.009 --> 26:35.885
I wanted to raise one with you.

26:35.969 --> 26:39.514
And if we're both not into this 100%,
then we shouldn't do it at all.

26:40.307 --> 26:42.600
Are you sure?
I know you really wanted this.

26:43.893 --> 26:44.978
Only if you did.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.400
Love you. Carry on, boys.

26:52.485 --> 26:54.237
You see that, kid? You see that?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.197
Now, that's a good woman right there.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.407
That is a good woman.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.993
When you get married,
you find a woman like Becky, OK?

27:02.579 --> 27:04.164
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

27:05.248 --> 27:08.209
Ha, I've still got it.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.715
OK, I'm back on track.

27:14.758 --> 27:15.925
Where did all my food go?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.345
Oh, well, you seemed busy,

27:18.428 --> 27:21.639
so I gave you a little hand
with the food and the table.

27:21.723 --> 27:23.808
Oh, no, you shouldn't have done that.

27:23.892 --> 27:26.686
Nobody puts together
a better Thanksgiving table than...

27:27.896 --> 27:28.730
you!

27:32.484 --> 27:34.361
Where did you get the cornucopias?

27:35.695 --> 27:37.280
They were in my trunk.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.325
You never know.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.706
[overlapping chatter]

27:52.128 --> 27:54.172
I thought this year
we'd be at the grown-up table.

27:54.255 --> 27:55.882
Mom, Alex is kicking me.

27:58.051 --> 28:00.470
And that's why
you're still at the kids' table.

28:03.306 --> 28:04.933
I'd like to make a toast, please.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.310
To my daughter, DJ.

28:07.394 --> 28:10.105
For reminding me what's important in life.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.440
My beautiful family and friends.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.193
And for this incredible
Thanksgiving feast.

28:15.276 --> 28:17.195
Well, CJ helped a little.

28:17.862 --> 28:18.780
I told them.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.368
[all] Cheers!

28:23.451 --> 28:24.411
[glasses clink]

28:24.494 --> 28:26.162
I would like to make a toast.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.705
Um...

28:28.206 --> 28:30.291
To the new couple, Matt and DJ.

28:31.793 --> 28:32.919
Who knows if it'll work out?

28:35.713 --> 28:37.340
The statistics say no.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.969
But... I'm pulling for you.

28:42.387 --> 28:45.432
[Steve] Cheers.
[all] Cheers.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.267
Well...

28:48.184 --> 28:50.228
let's hold hands, you too, kids,

28:50.311 --> 28:52.188
and let's give thanks.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.774
Dear God, thank you.

28:54.858 --> 28:57.444
We are so grateful
for this wonderful meal.

28:57.527 --> 29:00.447
And we're so fortunate
that we're all here together

29:00.530 --> 29:01.656
and we're healthy.

29:01.740 --> 29:05.201
We miss Michelle, we hope
that she'll be with us next year.

29:06.327 --> 29:07.704
Come, it'll be fun.

29:10.915 --> 29:11.750
Amen.

29:11.833 --> 29:12.959
[all] Amen.

29:13.042 --> 29:17.046
I'd like to say something
about my beautiful wife.

29:17.130 --> 29:20.133
Becky has such a big heart and she's
been saying that somewhere out there

29:20.216 --> 29:22.177
there's a kid that needs our love.

29:22.260 --> 29:24.554
So I'm here to tell everyone,

29:24.637 --> 29:25.972
let's do this.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.268
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

29:30.351 --> 29:31.478
We can adopt a baby?

29:31.561 --> 29:32.437
I'd like that.

29:32.520 --> 29:33.938
Oh.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.356
Have mercy.

29:43.948 --> 29:45.575
[clears throat]

29:45.658 --> 29:48.328
This may not be the best time...

29:55.585 --> 29:59.672
[nasal] but Kimmy asked me to tell Jesse
and his family some difficult news.

30:01.549 --> 30:03.384
Definitely not the best time.

30:05.053 --> 30:08.223
[normal voice]
I'd also like to thank Kimmy, uh,

30:08.306 --> 30:11.226
for inviting me and my entire family

30:11.309 --> 30:13.603
to stay, and I quote,

30:13.686 --> 30:16.731
"for as long as you'd like."

30:20.401 --> 30:22.445
I'm going to a motel.

30:24.072 --> 30:27.283
OK, everyone, grab some food.
Kids, come on over.

30:29.244 --> 30:30.787
Happy Thanksgiving!
