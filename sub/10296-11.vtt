00:16.567 --> 00:18.501
* Love and marriage *

00:18.501 --> 00:21.801
* Love and marriage *

00:21.801 --> 00:25.167
* Go together like
A horse and carriage *

00:25.167 --> 00:29.334
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.334 --> 00:31.234
* You can't have one *

00:31.234 --> 00:33.767
* Without the other *

00:33.767 --> 00:35.868
* Love and marriage *

00:35.868 --> 00:39.167
* Love and marriage-- *

00:39.167 --> 00:43.200
* It's an institute
You can't disparage *

00:43.200 --> 00:46.934
* Ask the local gentry *

00:46.934 --> 00:51.667
* And they will say
It's elementary *

00:51.667 --> 00:56.701
* Try, try
Try to separate them *

00:56.701 --> 00:59.968
* It's an illusion *

00:59.968 --> 01:02.667
* Try, try, try *

01:02.667 --> 01:08.467
* And you will only come
To this conclusion *

01:08.467 --> 01:10.868
* Love and marriage-- **

01:17.567 --> 01:19.567
Nice game, Peg.

01:19.567 --> 01:22.067
Oh, you're talking
to me again, huh?

01:22.067 --> 01:25.100
It was fun, Al.
It's only a game.

01:25.100 --> 01:28.100
No, it's only a game
if you win,

01:28.100 --> 01:31.100
but if you lose,
it's a stinking waste of time,

01:31.100 --> 01:33.100
especially if you lose

01:33.100 --> 01:35.601
to the Kiss-Me
Cosmetics Company.

01:35.601 --> 01:38.033
Well, they sure smelled good,
didn't they?

01:38.033 --> 01:41.033
And you know, Al,
I may have struck out
four times,

01:41.033 --> 01:43.534
but at least
I found out

01:43.534 --> 01:46.234
I was using
the wrong eyeliner.

01:46.234 --> 01:48.033
Peg, we lost to six women

01:48.033 --> 01:51.033
and three men
with visible panty lines.

01:51.033 --> 01:53.534
Bud, you had fun,
didn't you?

01:53.534 --> 01:55.901
You stink, Mom.

01:58.634 --> 02:00.033
We lost to women, Dad.

02:00.033 --> 02:02.100
You'll get
used to it, son.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.534
We haven't won
a game all season.

02:03.534 --> 02:05.601
Well, I'm going to go upstairs
and take a shower.

02:05.601 --> 02:07.901
Al, would you like me
to prepare your shower?

02:07.901 --> 02:09.901
You know, spray deodorant

02:09.901 --> 02:13.334
on the underarms
of a clean shirt?

02:13.334 --> 02:16.701
Peg, I don't have
any clean shirts.

02:16.701 --> 02:20.067
You guys can be
miserable if you want to,

02:20.067 --> 02:23.567
but I got out in the sunshine
and I had a good time.

02:23.567 --> 02:26.067
I love being on this team.

02:26.067 --> 02:28.367
Peg, you're right.
That's what
it's all about.

02:32.100 --> 02:35.601
We've got to get rid
of your mother, Bud.

02:35.601 --> 02:38.067
I know, Dad, but how?

02:38.067 --> 02:40.234
We've got to have
three women on the team.

02:40.234 --> 02:42.234
Well, we've got
to do something.
We're O in 7.

02:42.234 --> 02:43.667
If we lose
our next two games,

02:43.667 --> 02:45.033
we're out
of the league.

02:45.033 --> 02:48.467
And then you know where
we'll be spending our Sundays.

02:48.467 --> 02:49.634
Grandma's.

02:49.634 --> 02:51.834
Yeah.

02:51.834 --> 02:55.033
Well, it may not
come to that, son.

02:55.033 --> 02:57.033
Next week,
we're playing

02:57.033 --> 02:59.033
the Shaky Acres
Retirement Home...

02:59.033 --> 03:01.534
and their best player
has bladder problems.

03:01.534 --> 03:03.534
We'll take him out

03:03.534 --> 03:05.567
on the first play
at second.

03:05.567 --> 03:09.734
But your mother would
lose a grounder in the sun.

03:09.734 --> 03:12.501
It's too risky, Bud.
We need another woman.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.501
Well, this may be
stretching the word "woman,"

03:14.501 --> 03:16.334
but Kelly's pretty good--
she's got a great arm.

03:16.334 --> 03:21.067
I once saw her hit a police car
with a rock at 200 yards.

03:21.067 --> 03:24.234
I taught her to throw.
Let's sign her.

03:24.234 --> 03:26.067
I don't know.
Mom loves those games.

03:26.067 --> 03:28.767
How can we get her
not to play?

03:28.767 --> 03:30.267
Well, that's where
you come in, Bud.

03:30.267 --> 03:31.534
I leave it up to you.

03:31.534 --> 03:32.667
Nothing permanent.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.868
I just want her
out for two weeks.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.868
You can depend on me.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.100
Hey, I--

03:40.100 --> 03:43.033
I don't want
to know about it.

03:43.033 --> 03:45.534
Just do what
you have to do.

03:45.534 --> 03:47.033
Right, Dad.

03:47.033 --> 03:48.534
Three-women rule.

03:48.534 --> 03:51.467
If God had wanted
women to play ball,

03:51.467 --> 03:53.400
he'd have made them men.

03:55.534 --> 03:58.567
I just met
the most wonderful guy.

03:58.567 --> 04:00.801
He's nice,
he's courteous,

04:00.801 --> 04:03.400
he's never thrown a teacher
through a window,

04:03.400 --> 04:06.033
but still, there's
something I like about him.

04:06.033 --> 04:08.133
That's good, uh...
Think fast!

04:11.601 --> 04:13.968
You know, Kelly,
it's been a long time

04:13.968 --> 04:15.567
since we've had
a father-daughter talk.

04:15.567 --> 04:19.367
We've never had
a father-daughter talk.

04:19.367 --> 04:21.434
That's because
up until now,

04:21.434 --> 04:24.434
I've never had anything
to say to you, but...

04:24.434 --> 04:25.934
Sit down.

04:25.934 --> 04:28.434
You grew up so fast.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.434
Just seemed
like yesterday

04:30.434 --> 04:32.534
we were out
in the backyard
playing catch.

04:32.534 --> 04:34.200
Before Bud was born

04:34.200 --> 04:37.367
and you figured I was
your last chance?

04:37.367 --> 04:39.868
Bud means nothing to me.

04:39.868 --> 04:41.000
You were always
my favorite.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.334
You know that.

04:42.334 --> 04:43.868
Oh, Daddy...

04:43.868 --> 04:45.901
Yeah, come on, come on.

04:45.901 --> 04:49.901
Honey, I was just thinking,
you know, your old dad...

04:49.901 --> 04:51.901
might not
be around forever.

04:51.901 --> 04:53.901
That's what Mom says.

04:56.801 --> 04:58.133
Your mom is the reason

04:58.133 --> 05:00.400
that I might not
be around forever,

05:00.400 --> 05:03.334
but, no, honey,
I was thinking, you know,

05:03.334 --> 05:05.133
maybe you might like
to play a little ball

05:05.133 --> 05:06.734
on our team this Sunday.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.200
I thought Mom was playing.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.868
PEG: Ow!

05:09.868 --> 05:12.467
Al, I almost broke my toe
on your weights.

05:12.467 --> 05:15.667
I told you not to leave them
laying around.

05:17.634 --> 05:20.367
Mom might be
a little busy.

05:20.367 --> 05:23.033
You know, Dad,
I'd love to, but I can't.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.300
This new guy and I
are going to go watch them

05:25.300 --> 05:28.467
unload the '88 Harleys
down at the bike shop on Sunday.

05:28.467 --> 05:29.667
I think I'm in love.

05:29.667 --> 05:32.634
Kelly, honey, let me
tell you something.

05:32.634 --> 05:34.067
Guys will come
and guys will go,

05:34.067 --> 05:37.501
but your dad will always
be your dad...

05:37.501 --> 05:38.834
until he can't
take it anymore

05:38.834 --> 05:41.033
and he hops
on a freight train.

05:41.033 --> 05:42.400
Come on, honey.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.100
It'll be like old times
in the backyard.

05:44.100 --> 05:45.434
I can't, Daddy.
I've got a date.

05:46.501 --> 05:49.601
You're playing
third, Kelly.

05:49.601 --> 05:51.067
Oh, Daddy.

05:51.067 --> 05:54.567
Mom! Guess what.
I'm in love,

05:54.567 --> 05:57.067
and wait till you meet him.
He's perfect.

05:57.067 --> 05:58.100
He does
the cutest things.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.267
We went down to this

05:59.267 --> 06:00.534
great new restaurant
in New Town.

06:00.534 --> 06:01.868
We ate everything
on the menu,

06:01.868 --> 06:03.567
I mean, the most
expensive stuff.

06:03.567 --> 06:04.567
You know what he did?

06:04.567 --> 06:05.968
He put a roach
in the food,

06:05.968 --> 06:07.567
and we didn't have
to pay for anything.

06:10.234 --> 06:11.567
You're kidding.

06:11.567 --> 06:12.734
You know, that's amazing.

06:12.734 --> 06:15.968
I used to date a guy
who did that.

06:15.968 --> 06:17.968
Yeah, now your father
just takes me to restaurants

06:17.968 --> 06:19.467
where they have
their own bugs.

06:28.300 --> 06:30.300
So, what's his name?

06:30.300 --> 06:31.801
Brian.

06:31.801 --> 06:34.801
Oh, Mom, I love
everything about him--

06:34.801 --> 06:37.300
his hair, his lips,
his breath.

06:37.300 --> 06:38.801
His breath?

06:38.801 --> 06:42.300
Really?

06:42.300 --> 06:44.801
Well, there goes
the old myth

06:44.801 --> 06:47.868
of a girl wanting a guy
just like her father.

06:49.634 --> 06:51.167
Peg, I wonder why

06:51.167 --> 06:54.968
you never went after a guy
like your father,

06:54.968 --> 06:56.334
or weren't there any

06:56.334 --> 07:00.000
chronically unemployed
social parasites...

07:00.000 --> 07:03.334
the month you were
in your prime?

07:04.734 --> 07:07.467
Mom, how did you know
you were in love with Dad?

07:07.467 --> 07:08.567
Well...

07:08.567 --> 07:11.968
He was kind of
an athlete in school,

07:11.968 --> 07:14.567
and no one really thought
much about the future back then.

07:14.567 --> 07:18.634
BUD: Mom?

07:18.634 --> 07:20.534
Can you come up here
right away?

07:20.534 --> 07:21.634
Al, I'm talking to Kelly.

07:21.634 --> 07:22.934
Could you go see
what Bud wants?

07:22.934 --> 07:27.601
Clean up after the dog,
talk to your son--it never ends.

07:27.601 --> 07:29.000
You know, honey, you ought

07:29.000 --> 07:31.133
to bring Brian down
to watch us play softball.

07:31.133 --> 07:33.133
I was so good today.

07:33.133 --> 07:35.634
Well, I thought I was good.

07:35.634 --> 07:37.634
Daddy was a little upset,

07:37.634 --> 07:40.634
but, you know, he takes
these games much too seriously.

07:40.634 --> 07:43.400
AL: Whaa!

07:43.400 --> 07:45.133
[THUD]

07:45.133 --> 07:48.367
BUD: Dad, you ruined
everything.

07:50.868 --> 07:53.133
You don't love me.

07:53.133 --> 07:55.133
Yes, I do.

07:55.133 --> 07:58.634
Do you think that
I would do this for everyone?

07:58.634 --> 08:00.868
I've seen you do this
for everyone.

08:08.100 --> 08:09.601
AL: You stink!

08:09.601 --> 08:11.601
My parents are home.

08:11.601 --> 08:14.100
I thought they'd be playing
softball all day.

08:14.100 --> 08:16.868
I thought I'd leave home
by the time I was 15.

08:16.868 --> 08:19.100
You know, sometimes things don't
work out the way you think.

08:19.100 --> 08:20.501
Don't worry about
meeting my parents,

08:20.501 --> 08:21.734
except for my father.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.167
He's okay and all,

08:23.167 --> 08:25.534
but if he finds you
sitting in his spot,

08:25.534 --> 08:27.300
he'll punch you
in the face.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.100
Where's his spot?

08:29.100 --> 08:30.834
I forget.

08:32.100 --> 08:34.100
Anyhow, only talk to him

08:34.100 --> 08:36.100
about sports
and bodily functions.

08:36.100 --> 08:39.133
It's what he knows,
it's what he likes.

08:39.133 --> 08:41.133
Oh. One more thing--

08:41.133 --> 08:44.133
if you touch me
while he's here,

08:44.133 --> 08:46.133
he'll break your back.

08:46.133 --> 08:47.634
Ready?

08:49.133 --> 08:53.634
It was very brave of you
to play with that foot, Al.

08:53.634 --> 08:55.234
Yeah, freak accident,

08:55.234 --> 08:57.234
slipping on
a banana peel.

08:57.234 --> 08:59.133
How'd you do, Dad?

08:59.133 --> 09:01.133
I went 4 for 4,

09:01.133 --> 09:04.133
Bud went 4 for 4,
and your mom...

09:04.133 --> 09:06.133
Well, we lost 17-8.

09:06.133 --> 09:08.133
At least
I hit the ball, Al.

09:08.133 --> 09:10.133
Oh, great. You finally
make a bunt,

09:10.133 --> 09:13.167
and an 80-year-old man
beats you to first base.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.667
Course, he wasn't
wearing high heels.

09:15.667 --> 09:18.267
Bud, you want to get me
some juice, huh?

09:18.267 --> 09:20.167
Is this your spot?

09:20.167 --> 09:22.667
This is my house.

09:22.667 --> 09:25.901
Every spot is my spot.

09:25.901 --> 09:29.167
Mom, Dad, I'd like you
to meet Brian.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.167
Next week, we play
the Christian T-shirt Shop.

09:32.167 --> 09:37.167
Now, they've never won a game
because they refuse to steal,

09:37.167 --> 09:39.667
but they've never played us.

09:39.667 --> 09:43.100
Dad, the refrigerator's
been sucked dry.

09:45.200 --> 09:47.200
Who's this?

09:47.200 --> 09:48.601
It's Brian.

09:48.601 --> 09:50.601
Nice to meet
you, Brian.

09:50.601 --> 09:52.701
Yeah, nice
to meet you, Brian.

09:52.701 --> 09:53.701
Hi.

09:53.701 --> 09:55.701
Your breath
smells of juice.

09:55.701 --> 09:58.067
Oh, don't pay
any attention to Al.

09:58.067 --> 10:02.033
No one ever does.

10:02.033 --> 10:04.133
You know, you look
kind of familiar.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.200
Do I know you
from anywhere?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.200
I don't think so,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.801
but I do work
at the grocery store.

10:08.801 --> 10:12.300
Then there's no way
she ever saw you there.

10:12.300 --> 10:14.300
Drank all my juice, huh?

10:14.300 --> 10:16.300
Wait a second, Dad.

10:16.300 --> 10:19.334
Juice gives him
the essential vitamins

10:19.334 --> 10:21.334
he needs to fight...

10:21.334 --> 10:22.400
infections.

10:24.667 --> 10:28.167
Brian, I'd like you
to meet my brother, Bug.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.667
That's Bud.

10:29.667 --> 10:35.167
I was named after a beer,
wasn't I, Dad?

10:35.167 --> 10:39.167
So, Brian, outside of drinking
all our juice,

10:39.167 --> 10:42.167
what are your intentions
with Kelly here?

10:42.167 --> 10:44.167
Come on, everybody,

10:44.167 --> 10:46.400
let's give them
a little privacy.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.701
You know, I think my dad
really liked you.

10:58.701 --> 11:01.400
Gee, I really liked him.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.467
By the way,
thanks for saying,

11:03.467 --> 11:05.968
"Have some more juice.
There's plenty."

11:05.968 --> 11:07.968
You're more important
than my father.

11:07.968 --> 11:09.801
Am I?

11:09.801 --> 11:13.133
Sure. You know
how I feel about you.

11:13.133 --> 11:16.734
You know, it takes
more than words.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.000
There is a way

11:18.000 --> 11:19.234
you could
prove it to me,

11:19.234 --> 11:21.234
but you'd never do it.

11:21.234 --> 11:23.133
Yes, I would. What?

11:23.133 --> 11:25.667
You've known me
for two days.

11:25.667 --> 11:29.033
You know there's nothing
I wouldn't do.

11:29.033 --> 11:32.167
I know, but I'm talking
about a tattoo,

11:32.167 --> 11:34.667
one with my name on it.

11:34.667 --> 11:37.667
I'm getting one
with your name on it.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.167
You are?

11:39.167 --> 11:40.834
Yeah.

11:40.834 --> 11:43.667
That's the way
I feel about you, Kelly.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.734
Well, where do you
want me to put it?

11:45.734 --> 11:47.667
Anywhere,

11:47.667 --> 11:50.167
as long as it shows.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.167
So, like, anywhere.

11:52.167 --> 11:53.667
Yeah.

11:53.667 --> 11:58.567
I don't know.
My parents would kill me.

12:01.934 --> 12:03.868
I'll do it.

12:09.734 --> 12:10.834
AL: Come on, Peg,

12:10.834 --> 12:12.834
you're not leaving
till you catch a fly ball.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.133
PEG: It's dark.

12:14.133 --> 12:15.634
Catch!

12:15.634 --> 12:18.267
Ow!

12:18.267 --> 12:21.601
That's it, Al.
I am not practicing anymore.

12:21.601 --> 12:23.801
I'm good enough,
and it's just a game.

12:23.801 --> 12:26.033
It's not just a game.

12:26.033 --> 12:28.300
We'd better not lose
to the Christians, Peg.

12:28.300 --> 12:30.033
I'm warning you.

12:30.033 --> 12:32.567
I hate that
three-women rule.

12:32.567 --> 12:34.067
I hate women.

12:34.067 --> 12:36.067
Dad, can I talk to you?

12:36.067 --> 12:37.567
Oh, why?

12:37.567 --> 12:39.567
It's important, Daddy.

12:39.567 --> 12:40.734
Okay. Now, listen,

12:40.734 --> 12:42.667
this is
not about sex, is it?

12:42.667 --> 12:45.767
Because I don't know
anything about that.

12:45.767 --> 12:48.501
I know. Mom told me.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.334
No, it's not
about sex, Dad.

12:51.334 --> 12:53.000
Good. Good.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.501
Okay. Now,
I'm going to be

12:55.501 --> 12:58.000
totally straight
with you.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.000
There's this girl.
Let's call her... Betty.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.000
She has this guy
who wants her

13:04.000 --> 13:06.033
to look a certain
way for him,

13:06.033 --> 13:08.200
but, see, this girl

13:08.200 --> 13:10.467
isn't sure that she wants
to look this certain way.

13:10.467 --> 13:12.868
Kelly, let me
tell you something.

13:12.868 --> 13:16.868
Society, somehow, some way,
separated the sexes.

13:16.868 --> 13:19.033
Now, they made girls weak.

13:19.033 --> 13:23.033
Now, I'm not saying
it's bad to be a girl.

13:23.033 --> 13:25.033
I'd rather be dead myself.

13:25.033 --> 13:27.534
But it's always
the girl's place

13:27.534 --> 13:30.033
to do something
for the guy,

13:30.033 --> 13:34.033
Never the guy's place
to do anything for the girl--

13:34.033 --> 13:35.234
until you marry them--

13:35.234 --> 13:39.067
then the law steps in
and makes you.

13:39.067 --> 13:41.567
But back to this
friend of yours... Betty.

13:41.567 --> 13:44.501
See, she has to understand
that you don't always

13:44.501 --> 13:47.501
have to do
what the guy says,

13:47.501 --> 13:50.000
especially if Betty...

13:50.000 --> 13:52.000
is my little girl.

13:54.234 --> 13:56.667
Yeah, come on, come on.

13:56.667 --> 13:58.667
Okay, Peg! Get out in the hall!

13:58.667 --> 14:00.434
We're going to do
some grounders!

14:00.434 --> 14:01.901
I don't want to, Al.

14:01.901 --> 14:04.200
I didn't want to talk
to Kelly either, but I did.

14:17.534 --> 14:21.534
Yeah. Is this
Melvin's Tattoo?

14:21.534 --> 14:26.934
Yes. Can I make an appointment
for next Sunday?

14:29.033 --> 14:32.033
I know, I know. I stink.

14:32.033 --> 14:34.367
But it was close.

14:34.367 --> 14:38.033
We lost to nuns.

14:38.033 --> 14:40.534
I have never been
so humiliated.

14:40.534 --> 14:42.467
In front of everyone,

14:42.467 --> 14:46.901
you told Sister Mary Alice,
"Bless this, honey."

14:46.901 --> 14:50.000
Hey, I might not know
all the religious gestures,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.000
but I recognized
the one she gave to me.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.501
[DOORBELL RINGS]

14:54.501 --> 14:55.934
Gee, I wonder
who that could be.

14:55.934 --> 14:58.868
If there's any justice,
it's the baseball police.

14:58.868 --> 15:00.501
Yes?

15:00.501 --> 15:02.000
Hi, Peggy.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.501
You don't remember
me, do you?

15:04.501 --> 15:05.734
No.

15:05.734 --> 15:08.000
All right, I'll give
you a little hint.

15:08.000 --> 15:11.100
That night behind the aquarium
in high school?

15:11.100 --> 15:12.868
Oh, Craig!

15:14.334 --> 15:16.968
No.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.534
Ted!

15:19.534 --> 15:21.534
No.

15:21.534 --> 15:23.934
Rodrigo!

15:23.934 --> 15:26.434
No.

15:26.434 --> 15:29.200
Well, you're just
going to have to be
a little more specific.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.634
Jimmy.

15:30.634 --> 15:32.534
Oh, that aquarium.

15:32.534 --> 15:37.834
Well, come on in.

15:39.367 --> 15:43.968
Al, this is Jimmy,
from the aquarium.

15:43.968 --> 15:47.968
This is
my husband, Al.

15:47.968 --> 15:49.968
You're
a lucky man, Al.

15:49.968 --> 15:52.000
Yeah, right.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.000
So sit down, Jimmy.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.000
You want a beer?

15:56.000 --> 16:03.000
Sure.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.501
So, what brings you around here
after all this time?

16:06.501 --> 16:08.501
Well, I wondered
what became of you,

16:08.501 --> 16:10.000
so I looked you up.

16:10.000 --> 16:13.000
Who would ever have thought
that you'd be living

16:13.000 --> 16:16.334
in a nice, big place
like this?

16:16.334 --> 16:19.334
I've never been
in a house like this.

16:19.334 --> 16:22.334
How'd you let this one
get away, Peg?

16:22.334 --> 16:24.334
Actually, Al,
she dumped me.

16:24.334 --> 16:27.100
Yeah? What did you do?

16:27.100 --> 16:28.267
Nothing, really.

16:28.267 --> 16:31.033
It was just before
the sophomore dance.

16:31.033 --> 16:34.033
I'd rented a tux,
a car, bought flowers.

16:34.033 --> 16:37.534
I got to her house
just in time to see

16:37.534 --> 16:42.367
her little bottom pull off
on the back of a Harley.

16:42.367 --> 16:44.334
Let me get this straight.

16:44.334 --> 16:46.734
You think this house
is big, but her bottom--

16:46.734 --> 16:47.734
Al, Jimmy is speaking.

16:47.734 --> 16:49.734
And I didn't dump you.

16:49.734 --> 16:54.200
I just went out the back door
with a cuter guy.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.200
You know how kids are.

16:56.200 --> 16:59.567
Yeah, yeah,
I can laugh about it now.

16:59.567 --> 17:01.567
Ha ha ha!

17:01.567 --> 17:04.067
She didn't realize it then,

17:04.067 --> 17:07.434
but she was
the love of my life.

17:09.567 --> 17:12.067
See how lucky
you are, Al?

17:12.067 --> 17:16.467
See how lucky you are?

17:16.467 --> 17:17.867
You know, that night

17:17.867 --> 17:20.567
I was coming
to take you to the dance,

17:20.567 --> 17:23.334
I had something special
to show you.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.800
Look at this.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.801
Oh, Jimmy,
I'm so flattered!

17:29.801 --> 17:31.868
Well, look at that, Al.

17:31.868 --> 17:35.434
He has my name
tattooed on his arm.

17:35.434 --> 17:37.434
You never did that.

17:37.434 --> 17:39.934
Maybe that's because
I'm not insane

17:39.934 --> 17:42.100
like old Jimbo over there.

17:42.100 --> 17:44.033
Well, buddy,
thanks for stopping by.

17:44.033 --> 17:47.033
Next time you want to mutilate
some part of your body,

17:47.033 --> 17:49.234
swing by and show it to us.

17:49.234 --> 17:51.033
I'm going.

17:51.033 --> 17:53.133
I just wondered if you
knew what it was like

17:53.133 --> 17:54.701
to go through
your whole life

17:54.701 --> 17:58.033
with a tattoo of "Peggy"
on your arm.

17:58.033 --> 18:01.033
I had to marry
a girl named Peggy,

18:01.033 --> 18:03.534
a fat horse
of a Peggy.

18:03.534 --> 18:07.067
You know, the kind of woman
that looks like

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
she inhaled
another woman.

18:09.067 --> 18:13.567
I guess we should all be
grateful for what we have.

18:13.567 --> 18:15.767
You got a Peggy 
that's beautiful and fun.

18:16.968 --> 18:20.067
I got one that sleeps
standing up.

18:20.067 --> 18:24.834
I can laugh about that now,
though. Heh!

18:26.567 --> 18:29.300
We had fun in high school,
didn't we?

18:29.300 --> 18:31.634
Like when I took you
to that fancy restaurant

18:31.634 --> 18:33.300
and I put the roach
in the food

18:33.300 --> 18:35.400
and we got our meal for free.

18:35.400 --> 18:36.734
That's funny.

18:36.734 --> 18:39.434
My daughter's dating
a guy who did that.

18:39.434 --> 18:44.534
I know. It's my son.

18:44.534 --> 18:47.868
I can laugh
about that now too.

18:50.033 --> 18:51.534
Where's Kelly?

18:51.534 --> 18:53.534
I don't know,

18:53.534 --> 18:56.534
but I think she might
be out with Brian.

18:56.534 --> 18:59.033
That's great.
My daughter is out

18:59.033 --> 19:01.200
with the spawn of Norman Bates
and Sea Biscuit.

19:02.467 --> 19:06.467
I should have killed him
when he drank my juice.

19:06.467 --> 19:08.467
Maybe we'd better
go find her.

19:08.467 --> 19:10.868
Dad, I got a good one.

19:10.868 --> 19:14.400
This one is so good,
I won't even charge you.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.400
Guess where I saw Kelly.

19:16.400 --> 19:17.868
Eliminate the obvious

19:17.868 --> 19:20.400
like the back seat,
the bushes, jail.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.067
Now guess.

19:22.067 --> 19:25.834
Okay, time's up.
She's getting a tattoo.

19:25.834 --> 19:27.367
Yep.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.968
I saw her and Brian
go into the tattoo parlor.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.067
They were testing her arm.

19:32.067 --> 19:34.167
Should I bring down your belt?

19:34.167 --> 19:37.567
Al, you've got
to do something.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.067
Whoo! Much better
than a belt, Dad.

19:40.067 --> 19:42.067
I'm going
to go stop Kelly,

19:42.067 --> 19:46.033
then find Jimbo,
and hit one out of the park.

19:46.033 --> 19:48.033
Now, where's
this tattoo parlor?

19:48.033 --> 19:50.100
Okay, it's the one
next to the nightclub that says,

19:50.100 --> 19:51.434
"Girls, girls, girls."
You go down--

19:51.434 --> 19:52.300
I know where it is.

19:55.234 --> 19:57.100
Bud, where are you going?

19:57.100 --> 20:01.367
I'm moving my stuff
into my dead sister's room.

20:07.033 --> 20:08.534
Freeze.

20:08.534 --> 20:10.534
Show me your arm.

20:10.534 --> 20:12.901
Who spotted me?

20:12.901 --> 20:15.367
BUD: * Dum da-dum-dum-dum *

20:15.367 --> 20:17.367
Hey, that's my stuff!

20:17.367 --> 20:20.667
Never mind that, Kelly.
Show me your arm.

20:20.667 --> 20:23.067
Oh, Mom, I didn't
get the tattoo.

20:23.067 --> 20:24.467
I mean,
I was going to,

20:24.467 --> 20:26.901
but on the way over,
Brian told me the whole story,

20:26.901 --> 20:28.200
and a funny thing happened.

20:28.200 --> 20:29.567
We really did fall in love,

20:29.567 --> 20:31.234
and we both decided
to get tattooed.

20:31.234 --> 20:32.634
But then you realized

20:32.634 --> 20:34.367
how upset your father
and I would be?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.067
No.

20:36.067 --> 20:39.067
See, when Brian
was getting his tattoo,

20:39.067 --> 20:43.000
I saw the cutest guy,
and we fell in love,

20:43.000 --> 20:47.000
so I went outside,
and we rode off in the sunset

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
in his Domino's
pizza truck.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.501
This is it, Mom.
This is the real thing.

20:51.501 --> 20:55.033
You're really turning into
a fine young woman.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.033
You know, Mom, I feel closer
to you than ever

20:58.033 --> 21:02.501
now that both of these geeks
have tattoos.

21:02.501 --> 21:04.100
Yeah.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.100
You know, I feel kind of sorry
for Brian, though.

21:06.100 --> 21:08.167
He's going to have to go
through his whole life

21:08.167 --> 21:10.367
with "Kelly"
tattooed on his arm.

21:10.367 --> 21:11.367
That's no problem.

21:11.367 --> 21:12.868
I'll just introduce him

21:12.868 --> 21:15.868
to this other girl
at school named Kelly.

21:15.868 --> 21:18.567
She's kind of fat, though.

21:18.567 --> 21:22.834
Well, as long
as we're happy.

21:22.834 --> 21:25.300
Kelly, my hair.

21:25.300 --> 21:29.567
* Dum da-dum, dum-dum *

21:29.567 --> 21:30.901
Excuse me.

21:36.067 --> 21:38.567
I went to the tattoo parlor.

21:38.567 --> 21:40.067
Good news.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.200
She didn't get
the tattoo.

21:42.200 --> 21:45.334
I know. She's upstairs.
Did you find Jim?

21:45.334 --> 21:48.334
Yep. I followed Brian
to his house,

21:48.334 --> 21:50.334
broke the door down,

21:50.334 --> 21:53.834
and I was going to
break Jimmy's head when...

21:53.834 --> 21:56.834
she came out
of the kitchen.

21:56.834 --> 21:59.868
Peg, her face was
in a Jell-O mold.

21:59.868 --> 22:01.868
She was wearing
a muumuu,

22:01.868 --> 22:04.367
but it
had to be slit

22:04.367 --> 22:06.868
so she could
fit into it.

22:06.868 --> 22:08.868
Peg, she had no knees.

22:08.868 --> 22:10.868
So I let him live.

22:10.868 --> 22:15.234
I figured that's the worst thing
I could do to him.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.934
That's my Al.

22:17.934 --> 22:20.868
She was horrible, Peg,
horrible!

22:23.033 --> 22:25.367
You look good, Peg.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.534
Thanks, Al.

22:27.534 --> 22:30.400
God, she was fat.
