10:05.734 --> 10:08.486
SORRY, HOW LONG?

10:09.738 --> 10:10.863
YES, I AGREE.

10:10.864 --> 10:12.365
YOU KNOW, THE CAMP'S
PREVIOUS OWNER

10:12.366 --> 10:13.824
SHOULD HAVE TOLD HIM

10:13.825 --> 10:15.993
THERE WERE SO MANY ISSUES
BEFORE HE PURCHASED IT.

10:15.994 --> 10:18.330
♪ ♪

11:10.006 --> 11:13.216
♪ ♪

11:13.217 --> 11:14.969
COME ON. LET'S GO.

11:33.069 --> 11:33.903
THERE HE IS.

11:33.904 --> 11:35.112
HEY, GEORGE.

11:35.113 --> 11:36.488
WE JUST HEARD THE NEWS.

11:36.489 --> 11:38.365
HEY, CONNIE.

11:38.366 --> 11:39.450
IT'S SO GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

11:39.451 --> 11:40.784
COME HERE, YOU.

11:40.785 --> 11:42.119
WE COULDN'T BELIEVE IT,

11:42.120 --> 11:43.245
YOU'RE REALLY TAKING OVER
FOR YOUR UNCLE CHARLIE?

11:43.246 --> 11:44.371
YEAH, IT LOOKS
THAT WAY.

11:44.372 --> 11:46.332
ISN'T THAT JUST ABOUT
THE BEST NEWS.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.833
WE COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

11:47.834 --> 11:50.502
YEAH, YEAH, I'M PRETTY
EXCITED MYSELF.

11:54.549 --> 11:55.549
JILL...

11:55.550 --> 11:56.468
JILL!

11:56.469 --> 11:57.551
CAN YOU HOLD?

11:57.552 --> 11:59.470
JILL, THIS HAS TO
GO OUT TODAY.

11:59.471 --> 12:01.347
YOU CAN STILL
CATCH HIM.

12:01.348 --> 12:03.641
OKAY...

12:05.560 --> 12:07.394
EXCUSE ME!

12:07.395 --> 12:09.396
EXCUSE ME, SIR!

12:09.397 --> 12:10.357
SIR! SIR!

12:10.358 --> 12:11.482
JUST...

12:11.483 --> 12:13.109
DAD?

12:14.069 --> 12:15.069
HEY, KIDDO.

12:16.446 --> 12:18.071
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:18.072 --> 12:19.031
NOT TOO BAD, HUH?

12:19.032 --> 12:20.990
I DIDN'T KNOW.

12:20.991 --> 12:22.576
THIS IS YOUR NEW JOB.

12:23.494 --> 12:25.828
FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.205
I JUST STARTED
THIS ROUTE, THOUGH,

12:27.206 --> 12:28.414
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

12:28.415 --> 12:30.666
WE'VE NEVER
RUN INTO EACH OTHER BEFORE.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.294
YEAH, OF COURSE.

12:33.504 --> 12:36.631
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU
WORK, HUH? IT'S NICE.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.132
YEAH.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.051
HEY, MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU CAN
LET ME SEE YOUR OFFICE.

12:40.052 --> 12:42.554
YEAH, MAYBE.

12:44.390 --> 12:46.766
HEY, LISTEN,
I'D BETTER GET GOING.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.309
THEY KEEP ME ON
A PRETTY TIGHT SCHEDULE.

12:48.310 --> 12:49.435
YEAH, UM...

12:49.436 --> 12:50.937
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT,

12:50.938 --> 12:53.564
SO YOU'LL MAKE SURE
IT GETS OUT, RIGHT, DAD?

12:53.565 --> 12:56.109
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.318
YEAH.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.654
I'VE HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.616
I'M SORRY.

13:03.617 --> 13:05.993
NO. DON'T BE.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.454
I DESERVE THAT.

13:11.125 --> 13:13.127
PRACTICALLY ALREADY THERE.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.172
UM...

13:21.592 --> 13:23.177
YEAH.

13:24.095 --> 13:27.181
YOU TAKE CARE, DAD.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.076
AW, LOOK AT THAT SIGN.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.579
THAT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.415
ALWAYS BE SURE
YOUR LIFE VEST IS SECURE,

13:53.416 --> 13:56.042
AND NEVER GO ON THE WATER
WITHOUT A FRIEND, ALL RIGHT?

13:56.043 --> 13:57.085
ALL RIGHT?

13:57.086 --> 13:58.211
OKAY, EVERYBODY BUDDY-UP,

13:58.212 --> 14:00.130
AND THEN LINE UP
WITH YOUR COUNSELOR.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.548
HAVE SOME FUN, HUH?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.925
HEY! HEY, YOU MISSED
THE TALENT SHOW.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.135
THEY DID OUR
OLD ROUTINE.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.261
HOW WAS IT?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.054
AH, WE WERE FUNNIER.

14:08.055 --> 14:09.139
THAT'S GOOD.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.099
LET'S TALK.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.183
ALL RIGHT.

14:12.226 --> 14:13.477
DID YOU EVEN BOTHER

14:13.478 --> 14:15.227
TO LOOK AT THIS PLACE
AS A BUSINESS INVESTMENT?

14:15.228 --> 14:17.021
NO, I DIDN'T WANT IT
AS AN INVESTMENT.

14:17.022 --> 14:18.230
OH, THAT'S GOOD,

14:18.231 --> 14:19.523
'CAUSE IT HASN'T
MADE MONEY IN YEARS.

14:19.524 --> 14:21.108
I KNOW.
CHARLIE TOLD ME.

14:21.109 --> 14:22.276
AND YOU
TOOK IT ANYWAY?

14:22.277 --> 14:23.444
WHAT WAS I
SUPPOSED TO DO?

14:23.445 --> 14:25.112
LET SOME STRANGER
TAKE IT OVER?

14:25.113 --> 14:27.239
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.949
CHARLIE'S THE ONLY FAMILY
I EVER HAD.

14:28.950 --> 14:30.117
I SPENT
MY WHOLE LIFE HERE.

14:30.118 --> 14:31.118
LUKE, THIS IS
BUSINESS...

14:31.119 --> 14:33.537
NO, NO, THESE
ARE MY MEMORIES.

14:33.538 --> 14:34.955
MINE.

14:34.956 --> 14:36.332
HOW DO YOU PUT A PRICE
ON THAT?

14:36.333 --> 14:38.000
I DON'T KNOW.

14:38.001 --> 14:39.418
I GOT A CALL FROM THE STATE
SAFETY INSPECTOR'S OFFICE.

14:39.419 --> 14:40.711
THEY SENT A GUY
OUT HERE LAST WEEK.

14:40.712 --> 14:42.588
I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS.

14:42.589 --> 14:44.465
YEAH, NO ONE DOES.
THAT'S HOW IT WORKS.

14:44.466 --> 14:45.466
THEY JUST SHOW UP.

14:46.593 --> 14:49.637
OKAY, SO THESE ARE
THE ORIGINAL CABINS

14:49.638 --> 14:51.680
THAT WERE BUILT
WHEN THE CAMP FIRST OPENED

14:51.681 --> 14:53.724
50 YEARS AGO.

14:53.725 --> 14:54.684
NOT BAD.

14:54.685 --> 14:56.685
THEY LEAK,
THEY'RE DRAFTY,

14:56.686 --> 14:58.020
AND THEY'RE HOME

14:58.021 --> 14:59.396
TO ALL SORTS OF
LITTLE FURRY CRITTERS.

14:59.397 --> 15:01.732
THAT'S JUST PART
OF THE ADVENTURE.

15:01.733 --> 15:03.484
REALLY? AH, OKAY.

15:03.485 --> 15:04.610
COME HERE.

15:04.611 --> 15:06.987
SO, THE LOUNGE
IS ALSO ORIGINAL...

15:08.448 --> 15:10.616
THE ROOF WAS REPLACED
20 YEARS AGO,

15:10.617 --> 15:14.494
WHICH LED TO
ANOTHER SET OF PROBLEMS.

15:15.496 --> 15:16.996
JUST LIKE
WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

15:16.997 --> 15:19.582
DON'T YOU THINK
IT'S A LITTLE STRANGE

15:19.583 --> 15:20.625
THE ROOF IS LEAKING?

15:20.626 --> 15:22.043
NOT REALLY.

15:22.044 --> 15:24.504
IT'S NOT RAINING.

15:25.673 --> 15:27.549
HURRY UP.
TRAIN'S LEAVING.

15:27.550 --> 15:29.259
THERE'S MORE.

15:29.260 --> 15:34.013
SO... ALL THE TRACK LIGHTING
NEEDS TO BE REPLACED...

15:39.770 --> 15:41.813
AND...

15:41.814 --> 15:45.609
I GUESS THE FRIDGE AS WELL.

15:48.237 --> 15:50.029
WHY DO YOU THINK
YOUR UNCLE CHARLIE

15:50.030 --> 15:51.281
LET THE REST OF
THE STAFF GO?

15:51.282 --> 15:53.491
THE ATTENDANCE AT THE CAMP
IS SO FAR DOWN

15:53.492 --> 15:54.701
THAT HE COULDN'T
AFFORD TO PAY ANYBODY.

15:54.702 --> 15:55.868
GEORGE AND CONNIE
ARE DOING FINE.

15:55.869 --> 15:58.037
THEY'RE TRYING, YEAH,

15:58.038 --> 15:59.706
BUT THEY CAN'T KEEP UP.

15:59.707 --> 16:00.832
THE KIDS ARE HAVING FUN,

16:00.833 --> 16:02.375
THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.

16:02.376 --> 16:03.459
WE'LL GET SOME BIDS,

16:03.460 --> 16:04.836
HIRE A FEW PEOPLE
TO FIX THIS PLACE UP.

16:04.837 --> 16:06.296
LUKE, I TOLD YOU,

16:06.297 --> 16:07.672
ALL THESE CAUSES,

16:07.673 --> 16:09.966
YOU'RE STRETCHING YOURSELF
WAY TOO THIN RIGHT NOW, MAN.

16:09.967 --> 16:12.217
WITH ALL THIS MONEY YOU'VE GOT
TIED UP IN GREEN ENERGY...

16:12.218 --> 16:13.385
NO, WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THAT.

16:13.386 --> 16:14.553
THE WIND PUMPS MAKE SENSE.

16:14.554 --> 16:16.305
YES, THEY MAKE SENSE,

16:16.306 --> 16:18.515
BUT UNTIL THEY START
GENERATING CASH FLOW,

16:18.516 --> 16:21.476
YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE
ANYTHING ELSE ON RIGHT NOW...

16:21.477 --> 16:23.354
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

16:25.356 --> 16:27.691
EVEN IF YOU COME UP WITH
THE MONEY...

16:27.692 --> 16:28.734
WHICH IS A BIG IF...

16:28.735 --> 16:30.527
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE,

16:30.528 --> 16:31.570
NOT ANYMORE.

16:31.571 --> 16:33.030
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:33.031 --> 16:34.615
THE GUY
THE STATE SAFETY INSPECTOR

16:34.616 --> 16:36.033
SENT UP HERE LAST WEEK?

16:36.034 --> 16:37.576
HE SAW THE SAME PROBLEMS
I JUST SHOWED YOU,

16:37.577 --> 16:39.745
AND APPARENTLY
A WHOLE LOT MORE.

16:39.746 --> 16:42.080
NOW, IF THEY THINK
THAT THINGS ARE BAD ENOUGH,

16:42.081 --> 16:43.248
THEY COULD
SHUT THIS CAMP DOWN.

16:44.626 --> 16:45.710
SHUT IT DOWN?

16:46.753 --> 16:48.170
IT'S GONNA TAKE A FEW WEEKS

16:48.171 --> 16:49.379
TO WORK ITSELF
THROUGH THE SYSTEM

16:49.380 --> 16:51.215
BEFORE THEY OFFICIALLY
LET US KNOW.

16:52.175 --> 16:54.510
I'M SORRY.

16:55.595 --> 16:57.179
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:59.265 --> 17:00.432
I SHOULD PROBABLY JUST

17:00.433 --> 17:04.227
CUT MY LOSSES
AND QUIT?

17:04.228 --> 17:07.814
I WAS LEANING
THAT WAY, YEAH.

17:07.815 --> 17:10.733
MAKES SENSE.

17:10.733 --> 17:12.359
IT DOES.

17:12.361 --> 17:14.612
I MEAN, YOU WERE
RIGHT ABOUT THIS.

17:14.613 --> 17:18.616
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY
RIGHT, TOMMY.

17:18.617 --> 17:23.454
I SHOULD JUST...
WALK AWAY.

17:23.454 --> 17:25.915
"BYE, LUKE.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.290
BYE..."

17:27.291 --> 17:29.627
I'VE KNOWN YOU
MY WHOLE LIFE, OKAY?

17:29.628 --> 17:30.711
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
GOING TO QUIT.

17:30.712 --> 17:32.296
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU SHOULD KNOW

17:32.297 --> 17:34.298
WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

17:34.299 --> 17:36.175
THANKS, BUDDY.

17:36.176 --> 17:37.719
DON'T MENTION IT.

17:39.846 --> 17:41.847
A FEW WEEKS, HUH?

17:41.848 --> 17:43.224
YUP.

17:43.225 --> 17:45.768
THAT'S PLENTY OF TIME
TO FIX THIS PLACE UP.

17:45.769 --> 17:47.561
COME ON,
DON'T DIE ON ME NOW.

17:49.189 --> 17:50.690
COME ON, COME ON.

17:50.691 --> 17:51.857
YEAH.

17:51.858 --> 17:53.651
OKAY. WELL, THEN,
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME

17:53.652 --> 17:55.277
WHILE I HEAD BACK TO THE OFFICE

17:55.278 --> 17:56.821
TO FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO PAY FOR THIS.

17:56.822 --> 17:58.239
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE ONE OF THESE DAYS,

17:58.240 --> 18:00.241
YOU SHOULD CONSIDER
A DIFFERENT KIND OF CLIENT.

18:00.242 --> 18:01.909
IT'D MAKE YOUR LIFE
A LOT SIMPLER.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.994
A LOT LESS
INTERESTING.

18:03.995 --> 18:05.496
I'LL SEE YA.

18:05.497 --> 18:07.373
YOU'RE A GREAT SIDEKICK!

18:07.374 --> 18:08.707
BUSINESS MANAGER!

18:08.708 --> 18:09.749
WHATEVER.

18:09.750 --> 18:10.918
BUSINESS!

18:19.510 --> 18:21.344
NOW, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

18:21.345 --> 18:23.221
NOW, IF YOU PULL
THIS OFF, McDOWELL,

18:23.222 --> 18:25.807
THE PROMOTION, THE RAISE,
THE WHOLE SHOOTING MATCH,

18:25.808 --> 18:26.600
IT'S YOURS,

18:26.601 --> 18:27.851
AND I'LL WRAP IT UP

18:27.852 --> 18:29.394
IN A NICE, BIG, RED,
SATIN RIBBON FOR YOU AS WELL.

18:29.395 --> 18:31.688
- PULL WHAT OFF?
- AH.

18:31.689 --> 18:32.939
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO
TO PULL IT OFF,

18:32.940 --> 18:34.691
THAT IS
THE MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION.

18:34.692 --> 18:36.317
WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,

18:36.318 --> 18:38.945
THERE IS A GORGEOUS
PIECE OF PROPERTY

18:38.946 --> 18:39.946
IN NORTHERN OREGON...

18:39.947 --> 18:41.448
THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT, WRITE.

18:41.449 --> 18:44.242
IT IS QUIET, PRISTINE,
HAS GREAT LAKE VIEWS.

18:44.243 --> 18:46.828
I BELIEVE IT'LL MAKE
A FANTASTIC LUXURY RESORT

18:46.829 --> 18:47.954
FOR PUFFY, PASTY PEOPLE

18:47.955 --> 18:49.330
WHO LIKE TO PRETEND

18:49.331 --> 18:51.499
THAT THEY'RE ACTUALLY
GETTING EXERCISE.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.042
I'LL GET THE OWNER
ON THE PHONE...

18:53.043 --> 18:54.377
NOT SO FAST.

18:54.378 --> 18:55.712
A LITTLE MORE DETAILS.
CONTINUE TO WRITE.

18:55.713 --> 18:57.130
THE OWNER OF THIS PROPERTY

18:57.131 --> 18:59.466
HAS HELD ONTO IT
FOR, LIKE, THE LAST 30 YEARS.

18:59.467 --> 19:00.550
AND I ALSO HAVE
GOOD AUTHORITY

19:00.551 --> 19:02.177
THAT IT'S BEEN HEMORRHAGING
MONEY FOR A DOG YEAR.

19:02.178 --> 19:04.345
WELL, HE SHOULD BE
EAGER TO SELL.

19:04.346 --> 19:05.346
THAT'S OUR PROBLEM.

19:05.347 --> 19:07.639
HE ALREADY HAS. HE SOLD IT.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.891
TO WHO?

19:08.892 --> 19:10.225
TO, UH, I DON'T KNOW,

19:10.226 --> 19:11.560
SOMETHING CALLED
"ZEPPO ENTERPRISES"?

19:11.561 --> 19:13.020
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF 'EM.

19:13.021 --> 19:14.563
YEAH, ME NEITHER.

19:14.564 --> 19:16.565
SAYS HERE IT'S PRIVATELY HELD,
NO BOARDS, NO DIRECTORS.

19:16.566 --> 19:17.733
I'VE BEEN PHONING AROUND TOWN,

19:17.734 --> 19:19.401
I CAN'T EVEN FIND
THE NAME OF THE C.E.O.

19:19.402 --> 19:21.236
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

19:21.237 --> 19:22.404
EXCELLENT, ALL RIGHT,
YOU GET ON THAT,

19:22.405 --> 19:23.405
MAKE IT QUICK,

19:23.406 --> 19:24.740
UM, KEEP IT
UNDER THE RADAR, OKAY?

19:24.741 --> 19:25.824
JUST YOU AND I WILL KNOW?

19:25.825 --> 19:27.409
I DON'T WANT
ANY GERIATRIC BOOMERS

19:27.410 --> 19:29.536
GETTING ALL NOSTALGIC ON ME.

19:29.537 --> 19:30.871
NOSTALGIC ABOUT WHAT?

19:30.872 --> 19:33.415
WELL, IT WAS...

19:33.416 --> 19:34.750
SOME SORT OF SUMMER CAMP.

19:34.751 --> 19:35.918
IT'S BEEN THERE FOREVER...

19:35.919 --> 19:37.419
CAMP PINE LAKE?

19:38.838 --> 19:39.922
CAMP PINE LAKE?

19:39.923 --> 19:41.340
COULD YOU IMAGINE THAT?

19:41.341 --> 19:42.883
TAKING A BEAUTIFUL PIECE
OF REAL ESTATE LIKE THAT

19:42.884 --> 19:44.635
AND USING IT
FOR HYPERACTIVE KIDS?

19:44.636 --> 19:45.677
WOW.

19:45.678 --> 19:46.929
NIGHTMARE.

19:46.930 --> 19:49.264
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

19:49.265 --> 19:50.683
ALL RIGHT,
KEEP ME INFORMED.

19:56.231 --> 19:59.107
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
HE'D REALLY TEAR IT DOWN?

19:59.108 --> 20:00.609
MM-HM.

20:00.610 --> 20:01.735
THAT CAMP'S
BEEN THERE FOREVER.

20:01.736 --> 20:04.613
OH, WELL, IT WASN'T
EXACTLY A FOUR-STAR

20:04.614 --> 20:06.405
WHEN WE STAYED THERE.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.366
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE NOW?

20:08.367 --> 20:10.368
I LIKED IT.

20:10.369 --> 20:12.954
I KNOW, WE HAD
SO MUCH FUN, DIDN'T WE?

20:12.955 --> 20:14.288
YEAH.

20:14.289 --> 20:16.290
BUT THE THING IS,
THINGS CHANGE,

20:16.291 --> 20:18.709
AND YOU HAVE TO
JUST MOVE ON.

20:18.710 --> 20:20.002
YOU JUST CAN'T LIVE
IN THE PAST, RIGHT?

20:20.003 --> 20:21.712
I STILL THINK
IT'S KIND OF SAD.

20:21.713 --> 20:22.880
WHAT?

20:22.881 --> 20:23.965
IF IT WASN'T
FOR THAT SUMMER THERE,

20:23.966 --> 20:25.842
YOU AND I NEVER
WOULD'VE MET.

20:25.843 --> 20:27.093
I KNOW, I REMEMBER.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.263
YOU WERE VERY SWEET.

20:30.264 --> 20:31.764
I WONDER
WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM.

20:31.765 --> 20:32.765
WHO?

20:32.766 --> 20:34.475
OH, PUH-LEASE,
DON'T EVEN TRY.

20:34.476 --> 20:35.476
WHAT?

20:35.477 --> 20:36.978
MR. WONDERFUL?

20:36.979 --> 20:39.647
THE SMILE,
WITH THE EYES,

20:39.648 --> 20:42.108
AND THE LONG WALKS
ALONE BY THE LAKE?

20:42.109 --> 20:43.651
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

20:43.652 --> 20:44.944
LUKE GARVEY.

20:44.945 --> 20:46.487
YOU ARE SO BUSTED!

20:46.488 --> 20:47.738
SHUT UP,
I'M NOT BUSTED,

20:47.739 --> 20:50.533
BECAUSE I NEVER SAID
THAT I DIDN'T REMEMBER.

20:50.534 --> 20:52.493
OH, IT'S TOO BAD
YOU DIDN'T STAY IN TOUCH.

20:52.494 --> 20:53.995
WE TRIED, AND THEN
IT JUST, LIKE,

20:53.996 --> 20:57.124
BECAME THIS
COMPLICATED THING, SO...

21:02.921 --> 21:04.004
HOW'S THAT?

21:04.005 --> 21:05.631
NO!

21:09.969 --> 21:10.845
NOW?

21:10.846 --> 21:12.387
NO, I THINK THAT'S WORSE.

21:12.388 --> 21:14.849
COME AND HAVE
A LOOK.

21:16.517 --> 21:18.894
SEE, IT'S STILL
LEAKING IN HERE.

21:18.895 --> 21:20.687
DID YOU TRY THIS?

21:20.688 --> 21:22.230
WHOA, WHOA!
SHUT IT OFF!

21:22.231 --> 21:23.815
SO THE BIDS ARE COMING IN
HIGHER THAN I EXPECTED.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.400
I MEAN, I CAN TRY
AND TALK THEM DOWN,

21:25.401 --> 21:27.360
BUT WE CAN'T AFFORD
ALL OF THESE REPAIRS AT ONCE.

21:27.361 --> 21:28.528
NAH, I'M WAY
AHEAD OF YOU.

21:28.529 --> 21:29.946
I'M TAKING CARE OF
SOME IT MYSELF.

21:29.947 --> 21:30.865
YOU?

21:30.866 --> 21:32.532
DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

21:32.533 --> 21:34.159
I LEARNED A FEW THINGS
FROM UNCLE CHARLIE

21:34.160 --> 21:35.452
OVER THE YEARS.

21:35.453 --> 21:36.661
LOOK, I MIGHT
AS WELL TELL YOU.

21:36.662 --> 21:38.455
I TOOK A CLOSER LOOK
AT THE ENROLLMENT

21:38.456 --> 21:39.748
FOR THE SUMMER'S SECOND SESSION.

21:39.749 --> 21:40.916
AH!

21:40.917 --> 21:41.876
THE GOOD NEWS.

21:41.877 --> 21:43.335
LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

21:43.336 --> 21:45.754
THE FIRST SESSION LASTS
THROUGH THE 4th OF JULY.

21:45.755 --> 21:47.714
NOW, IF ENROLLMENT DOESN'T
PICK UP SUBSTANTIALLY

21:47.715 --> 21:48.715
BY THEN,

21:48.716 --> 21:49.883
THERE WON'T BE A SECOND SESSION.

21:49.884 --> 21:50.967
HEY, COME ON,

21:50.968 --> 21:52.385
ONCE WE GET THIS PLACE
UP TO CODE,

21:52.386 --> 21:53.970
THEY'LL BE LINING UP
AROUND THE BLOCK.

21:53.971 --> 21:56.431
LET ME GET THIS HERE, OKAY?

21:56.432 --> 21:57.641
I'LL TALK
TO YOU LATER,

21:57.642 --> 21:58.683
AND DON'T WORRY SO MUCH.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.061
YEAH. LATER.

22:01.812 --> 22:03.020
HELLO?

22:03.021 --> 22:04.730
HELLO? HI. IS THIS
ZEPPO ENTERPRISES?

22:04.731 --> 22:06.315
YES.
WHO'S CALLING?

22:06.316 --> 22:07.983
CAN YOU PLEASE PUT ME THROUGH
TO YOUR C.E.O.'S OFFICE?

22:07.984 --> 22:09.902
WELL, TECHNICALLY,
HE DOESN'T HAVE AN OFFICE,

22:09.903 --> 22:11.028
AND EVEN IF HE DID,

22:11.029 --> 22:12.363
HE DOESN'T
TALK TO PEOPLE.

22:12.364 --> 22:14.406
I UNDERSTAND
HE MUST BE VERY BUSY,

22:14.407 --> 22:16.867
BUT, UM, CAN YOU PLEASE
GIVE ME HIS NAME?

22:16.868 --> 22:18.911
HE PREFERS TO
REMAIN ANONYMOUS.

22:18.912 --> 22:20.037
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

22:20.038 --> 22:21.872
WELCOME TO THE CLUB.

SLICE OF HEAVEN TALKING TO YOU...

THIS IS ABOUT?

22:26.628 --> 22:27.878
NOT ESPECIALLY.

22:27.879 --> 22:29.505
THAT'S NO WAY
TO RUN A BUSINESS.

22:29.506 --> 22:32.549
LOOK, I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE DIFFICULT HERE.

22:32.550 --> 22:33.884
IT'S JUST THE WAY HE WANTS IT.

22:33.885 --> 22:35.094
BESIDES,
HE'S NOT EVEN HERE.

22:35.095 --> 22:36.595

WE'VE GOT CAMP SPIRIT
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

29:11.942 --> 29:13.818
WE'VE GOT CAMP SPIRIT!
YES, WE DO!

29:13.819 --> 29:16.113
WE'VE GOT CAMP SPIRIT
HOW 'BOUT YOU?

29:17.490 --> 29:18.782
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID, PETER.

29:18.783 --> 29:20.450
THE CAMP'S IN REALLY
ROUGH CONDITION.

29:20.451 --> 29:21.493
CAN THIS NEW OWNER

29:21.494 --> 29:23.203
GET THIS PLACE
BACK IN SHAPE?

29:23.204 --> 29:26.331
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT IT MATTERS TO HIM.

29:26.332 --> 29:27.957
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM?

29:27.958 --> 29:29.042
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.

29:29.043 --> 29:30.126
I THINK THAT

29:30.127 --> 29:31.294
HE LIKES THINGS
THE WAY THEY ARE.

29:31.295 --> 29:32.962
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:32.963 --> 29:34.506
THIS GUY'S LOSING TONS OF MONEY,
AND HE ACTUALLY LIKES IT?

29:34.507 --> 29:36.216
THIS IS GOING
TO BE EASY.

29:36.217 --> 29:38.551
WE'RE GOING TO SO
OWN THIS GUY, McDOWELL.

29:38.552 --> 29:39.928
UM, PETER...

29:39.929 --> 29:41.012
YEAH?

29:41.013 --> 29:42.180
THERE'S SOMETHING

29:42.181 --> 29:43.473
THAT I HAVE TO
TELL YOU.

29:43.474 --> 29:45.016
OKAY.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.560
I WENT TO CAMP PINE LAKE,

29:47.561 --> 29:50.021
FOR SEVEN YEARS.

29:50.022 --> 29:51.897
HMM, THAT'S INTERESTING.

29:51.898 --> 29:53.065
I NEVER TOOK YOU

29:53.066 --> 29:54.983
FOR THE OUTDOORSY TYPE,
THERE, McDOWELL.

29:54.984 --> 29:57.319
I'M NOT,
AND I'M NEVER GOING TO BE,

29:57.320 --> 29:59.154
AND IT WAS
A REALLY LONG TIME AGO,

29:59.155 --> 30:00.447
AND IT WAS
REALLY SILLY...

30:00.448 --> 30:02.116
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT,
I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND.

30:02.117 --> 30:04.243
YOUR PARENTS PROBABLY MADE YOU
GO AS A KID. IT HAPPENS.

30:04.244 --> 30:06.286
THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU
DIDN'T TELL ME. IT'S FINE.

30:06.287 --> 30:07.205
RIGHT,

30:07.206 --> 30:08.580
AND THE OTHER THING IS,

30:08.581 --> 30:09.581
THIS ZEPPO GUY,

30:09.582 --> 30:11.375
THE NEW OWNER?

30:11.376 --> 30:12.293
MM-HM.

30:12.294 --> 30:14.378
UM, I-I KNOW HIM.

30:14.379 --> 30:15.963
WELL, I KNEW HIM, AND...

30:15.964 --> 30:18.549
'CAUSE WE WENT TO CAMP TOGETHER.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.050
SO, WHAT'S NEXT,

30:20.051 --> 30:21.552
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME HE WAS
ONE OF YOUR OLD BOYFRIENDS?

30:21.553 --> 30:24.888
UH, YEAH, KIND OF.

30:24.889 --> 30:28.058
YOU NEVER CEASE
TO AMAZE ME, McDOWELL.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.601
YOU'RE ALWAYS A STEP AHEAD.

30:29.602 --> 30:30.686
I DON'T GET IT.

30:30.687 --> 30:32.229
NO, LOOK,
THIS IS PERFECT.

30:32.230 --> 30:34.064
IT'S FANTASTIC.

30:34.065 --> 30:35.232
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS,
YOU GO DOWN THERE,

30:35.233 --> 30:36.567
HE WALKS YOU DOWN MEMORY LANE,

30:36.568 --> 30:38.068
YOU REBUILD YOUR FRIENDSHIP,

30:38.069 --> 30:39.194
AND YOU USE THAT ANGLE
TO GET THE PRICE DOWN.

30:39.195 --> 30:40.113
PETER...

30:40.114 --> 30:41.238
NO, NO, LISTEN,

30:41.239 --> 30:42.239
YOU STAY DOWN THERE,
McDOWELL, OKAY?

30:42.240 --> 30:43.490
AND YOU CLOSE THIS DEAL.

30:43.491 --> 30:45.617
YOU WORK THIS GUY,
AND YOU CLOSE THIS DEAL.

30:45.618 --> 30:47.035
YOU UNDERSTAND?

30:47.036 --> 30:50.037
YOU UNDERSTAND?

30:50.038 --> 30:51.414
UM...

30:51.415 --> 30:53.083
McDOWELL, DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

30:54.626 --> 30:56.169
I UNDERSTAND.

30:56.170 --> 30:57.212
PERFECT.

30:58.046 --> 31:00.756
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
YOU'RE A PEACH.

31:06.763 --> 31:08.973
OH, MAN...

31:16.231 --> 31:18.357
OKAY, BREAKFAST IS HOT,
IT'S READY,

31:18.358 --> 31:20.151
SO COME AND GET IT!

31:26.700 --> 31:29.495
COME ON. HURRY UP.

31:44.718 --> 31:46.010
MORNING, HON'.

31:46.011 --> 31:47.303
OH, HEY, CONNIE.

31:47.304 --> 31:48.553
I'M LOOKING FOR LUKE.

31:48.554 --> 31:50.305
YEAH, HE'S JUST DOWN
GETTING THE CANOES OUT.

31:50.306 --> 31:51.348
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

31:51.349 --> 31:52.225
OKAY.

31:52.226 --> 31:53.517
YOU LOOK...

31:53.518 --> 31:54.518
REAL NICE THIS MORNING.

31:54.519 --> 31:56.937
OH, THANK YOU.

31:56.938 --> 32:00.023
IT'S A LITTLE BIT...
FANCY FOR CAMP.

32:00.024 --> 32:01.441
IT'S ALL I HAVE HERE.

32:01.442 --> 32:03.652
I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU
IN THE LOST AND FOUND.

32:03.653 --> 32:05.654
REALLY?
THE LOST AND FOUND?

32:05.655 --> 32:06.738
I KEEP EVERYTHING
NEAT AND CLEAN,

32:06.739 --> 32:08.323
JUST IN CASE.

32:08.324 --> 32:09.866
WANT TO TAKE A LOOK?

32:09.867 --> 32:10.992
OKAY.

32:10.993 --> 32:12.244
COME ON, IT MIGHT BE FUN.

32:12.245 --> 32:13.662
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
FOR EVERYBODY BACK HERE,

32:13.663 --> 32:15.247
NOT JUST CAMPERS, YOU KNOW.

32:15.248 --> 32:16.207
REALLY?

32:16.207 --> 32:17.166
YUP.

32:17.166 --> 32:18.084
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

32:18.085 --> 32:19.085
DON'T WORRY, I GOT IT.

32:19.086 --> 32:21.336
HEY, LET'S SEE THAT ARM.

32:21.337 --> 32:22.337
NICE! NICE!

32:22.338 --> 32:24.172
HERE. THINK FAST.

32:24.173 --> 32:25.340
THAT'S A GOOD LOOK
FOR YOU.

32:25.341 --> 32:26.550
OH, THANKS.

32:26.551 --> 32:28.176
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
A LITTLE MORE PRACTICAL.

32:28.177 --> 32:29.511
DEFINITELY
WAY MORE PRACTICAL.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.471
COME ON, I WANT TO
SHOW YOU YOUR OLD ROOM.

32:31.472 --> 32:32.557
OKAY, OKAY. COMING.

32:41.107 --> 32:43.108
IT'S MY OLD CABIN!

32:43.109 --> 32:45.235
I KNOW, I KNOW.

32:45.236 --> 32:46.652
HEY, I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

32:46.653 --> 32:48.154
WHAT?

32:49.072 --> 32:50.114
LOOK AT THAT.

32:51.033 --> 32:52.033
THIS IS MY OLD BUNK.

32:52.034 --> 32:53.117
I KNOW, YOU REMEMBER
DOING THAT?

32:53.118 --> 32:54.035
I DO!

32:54.036 --> 32:56.830
I REMEMBER THE DAY
SO WELL.

32:57.747 --> 32:58.872
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

32:58.873 --> 33:00.124
UH, A LITTLE.

33:00.125 --> 33:01.834
DO WE DARE SEE
WHAT CONNIE'S MAKING?

33:01.835 --> 33:03.545
UH, MAYBE.

33:07.716 --> 33:08.716
COME ON.

33:08.717 --> 33:09.884
ALL RIGHT.

33:10.719 --> 33:12.261
HEY!

33:12.262 --> 33:13.387
OKAY, NO OFFENSE,

33:13.388 --> 33:16.140
BUT THIS PLACE
IS FALLING APART

33:16.141 --> 33:17.558
AND, IN ORDER
TO FIX IT,

33:17.559 --> 33:19.351
AND IT'S GOING TO
TAKE A LOT OF TIME,

33:19.352 --> 33:20.769
AND A LOT OF MONEY,
RIGHT?

33:20.770 --> 33:22.062
TRUE.

33:22.063 --> 33:23.397
AND YOU'VE PUT
SO MUCH INTO THE CAMP

33:23.398 --> 33:24.690
THAT I THINK IT'S TIME

33:24.691 --> 33:27.109
THAT YOU STARTED
GETTING SOMETHING BACK,

33:27.110 --> 33:28.444
FOR YOURSELF.

33:28.445 --> 33:29.778
I GET A LOT BACK.

33:29.779 --> 33:31.614
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE SHOULDERING
A LOT OF WEIGHT

33:31.615 --> 33:33.073
BY YOURSELF,

33:33.074 --> 33:36.243
AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE
A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE

33:36.244 --> 33:37.578
WHO WANT TO HELP YOU.

33:37.579 --> 33:39.413
THAT'S WHY YOU CAME BACK,

33:39.414 --> 33:40.873
TO HELP OUT?

33:40.874 --> 33:42.374
YEAH... YOU KNOW.

33:44.419 --> 33:47.713
YOUR TIMING IS AMAZING.

33:49.757 --> 33:51.591
HEY, JENNY.

33:51.592 --> 33:53.426
HOW ARE THE LESSONS GOING?

33:53.427 --> 33:54.886
PRETTY GOOD.

33:54.887 --> 33:56.763
JENNY,
THIS IS MY FRIEND ZOE.

33:56.764 --> 33:58.306
SHE'S AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE.

33:58.307 --> 34:01.351
WHEN ZOE WENT TO CAMP HERE,
SHE WAS THE BEST RIDER.

34:01.352 --> 34:02.560
YOU WERE?

34:02.561 --> 34:05.104
WELL, THAT WAS
A VERY LONG TIME AGO...

34:05.105 --> 34:06.522
SHE USED TO
GIVE LESSONS, TOO.

34:06.523 --> 34:09.692
I'LL BET YOU SHE COULD
SHOW YOU A FEW TRICKS.

34:09.693 --> 34:11.277
OH, LUKE,

34:11.277 --> 34:13.655
I... I DON'T THINK THAT
THAT'S GONNA...

34:13.656 --> 34:15.697
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:15.699 --> 34:17.283
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
WAY TOO BUSY.

34:17.284 --> 34:19.034
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
THOUGH.

34:19.036 --> 34:21.245
ZOE'S GOING TO BE
HANGING AROUND FOR A WHILE.

34:21.246 --> 34:22.371
SHE'S WHAT YOU CALL
AN INVESTOR.

34:22.373 --> 34:23.790
WHAT DOES
THAT MEAN?

34:23.791 --> 34:26.250
IT MEANS SHE'S GOING TO
PUT MONEY IN

34:26.251 --> 34:27.960
TO HELP FIX UP THE CAMP.

34:27.960 --> 34:29.587
UM, LUKE...

34:29.588 --> 34:30.630
BUT AS SOON AS
SHE GETS SETTLED IN,

34:30.630 --> 34:31.880
YOU TWO CAN
COME OUT HERE,

34:31.882 --> 34:34.384
AND SHE'LL HAVE YOU
RIDING IN NO TIME.

34:34.385 --> 34:35.344
REALLY?

34:35.344 --> 34:37.553
UH...

34:38.681 --> 34:41.683
UM, YES, REALLY.

34:41.684 --> 34:43.476
YES.

34:44.393 --> 34:45.395
HE'S HERE.

34:46.896 --> 34:47.813
GREAT.

34:47.815 --> 34:49.023
UH, HAVE HIM COME IN.

34:49.857 --> 34:52.777
YOU CAN GO IN NOW.

34:55.905 --> 34:57.489
PETER SHOREMAN.

34:57.490 --> 34:59.157
THANKS FOR
TAKING THE TIME.

34:59.158 --> 35:00.158
YEAH, NOT A PROBLEM.

35:00.159 --> 35:01.326
PLEASE, HAVE A SEAT.

35:01.327 --> 35:02.787
SURE. THANKS.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.460
SO, UH,

35:10.461 --> 35:12.212
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU,
MR. SHOREMAN?

35:12.213 --> 35:14.506
I GOT TO TELL YOU, TOMMY,

35:14.507 --> 35:16.300
I LOVE IT
WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME THAT.

35:19.554 --> 35:20.679
I WAS THINKING,

35:20.680 --> 35:22.305
THOSE FRIENDS
OF YOURS,

35:22.306 --> 35:23.515
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT
BE A GOOD IDEA

35:23.516 --> 35:25.684
FOR THEM TO SEE THE CAMP
FOR THEMSELVES.

35:25.685 --> 35:27.227
WHY?

35:27.228 --> 35:28.562
WELL, THOSE PICTURES
YOU'VE BEEN TAKING,

35:28.563 --> 35:32.024
THEY PROBABLY WON'T
DO THIS PLACE JUSTICE.

35:34.569 --> 35:39.698
I DON'T THINK CAMP PINE LAKE
IS ALL THAT PHOTOGENIC

35:39.699 --> 35:41.908
IN ITS
CURRENT STATE.

35:41.909 --> 35:44.577
LUKE, SUPPOSE THEY WON'T
INVEST IN THE CAMP.

35:44.578 --> 35:46.287
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
SELLING IT,

35:46.288 --> 35:47.872
IF THE PRICE WAS RIGHT?

35:47.873 --> 35:50.082
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.917
WHY NOT?

35:51.918 --> 35:53.669
IF I SELL IT,

35:53.670 --> 35:55.504
THEY CAN DO ANYTHING
THEY WANT WITH IT.

35:55.505 --> 35:56.839
THAT'S WHY
I WANTED IT,

35:56.840 --> 35:59.842
TO KEEP IT HERE,
THE WAY IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

35:59.843 --> 36:00.968
YEAH, BUT THINGS CHANGE, LUKE.

36:00.969 --> 36:02.344
YOU CAN'T LIVE IN THE PAST.

36:02.345 --> 36:03.679
WHY NOT?

36:03.680 --> 36:04.805
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO MOVE ON.

36:06.391 --> 36:07.684
AND THEN WHAT?

36:09.061 --> 36:10.395
AND THEN...

36:11.730 --> 36:13.814
AND THEN YOU...

36:13.815 --> 36:16.567
LOOK.

36:16.568 --> 36:17.693
I'M NOT SAYING

36:17.694 --> 36:19.153
WE SHOULD SPEND
THE REST OF OUR LIVES

36:19.154 --> 36:22.323
SWAPPING STORIES ABOUT
THE GOOD OLD DAYS,

36:22.324 --> 36:24.825
BUT WHY SHOULDN'T WE
HOLD ON TO THE PAST?

36:24.826 --> 36:26.619
AT LEAST THE PARTS
THAT MATTER TO US,

36:26.620 --> 36:28.579
THE PARTS WE LOVE?

36:28.580 --> 36:31.624
BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO
COME BACK TO REALITY.

36:31.625 --> 36:36.462
'CAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT
THE RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW.

36:36.463 --> 36:37.755
SOMETIMES I'D TRADE

36:37.756 --> 36:39.632
ALL THE "RIGHT NOWS"
IN THE WORLD

36:39.633 --> 36:40.757
FOR ONE MORE DAY

36:40.758 --> 36:45.471
IN THAT PART OF THE PAST
THAT I LOVE.

36:46.847 --> 36:48.682
COME ON, I WANT TO
SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

36:57.107 --> 36:58.358
LOOK FAMILIAR?

36:58.359 --> 37:00.610
YEAH.

37:00.611 --> 37:02.403
YOU STILL COME HERE.

37:02.404 --> 37:04.072
SOMETIMES.

37:04.073 --> 37:05.949
YOU KNOW, I THINK.

37:05.950 --> 37:07.659
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT?

37:07.660 --> 37:10.078
A LOT OF THINGS.

37:10.079 --> 37:13.456
UM... LIKE WHY ALL OF A SUDDEN

37:13.457 --> 37:15.708
YOU STOPPED ANSWERING
MY LETTERS?

37:15.709 --> 37:18.002
OOH...

37:18.003 --> 37:19.087
LUKE...

37:19.088 --> 37:20.296
I TRIED CALLING,

37:20.297 --> 37:21.714
YOUR PHONE WAS
DISCONNECTED.

37:21.715 --> 37:23.967
YOU NEVER CAME BACK.

37:23.968 --> 37:26.052
IT WAS A REALLY LONG TIME AGO.

37:26.053 --> 37:27.428
I NEVER HEARD FROM YOU AGAIN.

37:27.429 --> 37:29.722
I-I WAS WORRIED
SOMETHING HAPPENED.

37:29.723 --> 37:32.851
WE WERE KIDS.

37:32.852 --> 37:34.228
IT WASN'T REAL.

37:35.646 --> 37:36.939
IT WAS TO ME.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.482
I HAVE TO GO...

37:40.483 --> 37:43.611
NO, WAIT, ZOE.

37:44.988 --> 37:47.322
WHY'D YOU DISAPPEAR ON ME?

37:47.323 --> 37:48.574
I MEAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

37:48.575 --> 37:51.660
I GREW UP.

37:51.661 --> 37:53.162
I DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A CHOICE.

37:54.998 --> 37:57.666
I... I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:57.667 --> 37:59.001
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:59.002 --> 38:01.378
BECAUSE YOU NEVER
LEFT THIS CAMP.

38:01.379 --> 38:03.756
YOU KNOW, NONE OF THIS MATTERS.

38:06.009 --> 38:07.676
WELL, OF COURSE IT MATTERS...

38:07.677 --> 38:09.094
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT MATTERS

38:09.095 --> 38:11.597
IS WHEN YOU COME HOME

38:11.598 --> 38:15.392
AND YOU FIND OUT
THAT EVERYTHING'S CHANGED,

38:15.393 --> 38:18.687
AND EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN
HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY,

38:18.688 --> 38:20.689
AND NOBODY REALLY
GIVES A DAMN

38:20.690 --> 38:24.234
HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT IT.

38:24.235 --> 38:25.904
UM...

38:29.782 --> 38:31.033
ZOE, I...

38:31.034 --> 38:33.035
NO, FACE IT, LUKE.

38:33.036 --> 38:36.039
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH OTHER.

38:49.051 --> 38:50.927
MORNING, McDOWELL.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.887
SO, LISTEN, DID YOU
DIG OUT SOME DIRT ON THIS GUY

38:52.888 --> 38:54.680
SO WE CAN HAGGLE HIM
TO HIS BOOT STRAPS?

38:54.681 --> 38:57.683
THINGS ARE A LOT WORSE
THAN WE THOUGHT.

38:58.727 --> 39:00.019
THAT'S WHAT
I LIKE TO HEAR.

39:00.020 --> 39:01.395
YOU GOT ANY PICTURES
OR ANYTHING

39:01.396 --> 39:02.688
FOR US TO WORK WITH?

39:02.689 --> 39:03.981
YEAH, I GOT EVERYTHING
THAT WE NEED.

39:03.982 --> 39:06.192
YOU OKAY THERE, McDOWELL?

39:06.193 --> 39:07.193
MM-HM.

39:07.194 --> 39:08.527
I'M FINE.

39:08.528 --> 39:09.612
THIS IS A BIG DEAL
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

39:09.613 --> 39:10.905
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

39:10.906 --> 39:12.073
IF YOU CLOSE
THIS DEAL,

39:12.074 --> 39:13.950
THEN YOU'RE IN THE BIGS.

39:13.951 --> 39:17.411
RIGHT, WELL, THERE IS NO
INTERNET SERVICE HERE

39:17.412 --> 39:18.913
THERE'S NO
CELL PHONE SERVICE,

39:18.914 --> 39:21.040
SO I CAN'T SEND THESE PICTURES,

39:21.041 --> 39:22.875
SO I'VE GOT TO BRING THEM
BACK WITH ME TONIGHT...

39:22.876 --> 39:24.168
NO. NO, NO.
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

39:24.169 --> 39:25.544
WHAT? WHY?

39:25.545 --> 39:26.837
NO, NO, YOU STAY UP THERE,
McDOWELL, OKAY?

39:26.838 --> 39:28.047
YOU LOCK
THIS DEAL DOWN.

39:28.048 --> 39:30.174
ANYTHING CHANGES,
YOU CALL ME.

39:30.175 --> 39:32.678
OKAY?

40:21.142 --> 40:22.308
WHATCHA DOIN'?

40:22.309 --> 40:23.144
OH, MY GOSH!

40:24.562 --> 40:25.521
YOU SCARED ME.

40:25.522 --> 40:28.189
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY...

40:28.190 --> 40:29.941
YOU, UH, YOU
MISSED BREAKFAST.

40:29.942 --> 40:31.860
YES, I DID.
IT'S FINE.

40:31.861 --> 40:33.820
YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY
JUST AS WELL.

40:33.821 --> 40:35.571
WE HAD CONNIE'S
"GREEN STUFF,"

40:35.572 --> 40:36.822
AND YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY.

40:36.823 --> 40:37.948
WHAT DO THEY SAY?

40:37.949 --> 40:39.241
"AT LEAST IT WASN'T
THE BLUE STUFF."

40:39.242 --> 40:40.868
NOT FUNNY.

40:40.869 --> 40:41.745
NOT FUNNY AT ALL.

40:41.746 --> 40:42.786
I KNOW.

40:42.787 --> 40:43.747
UM, SO,

40:43.748 --> 40:46.874
I WANTED TO, UH, TALK TO YOU

40:46.875 --> 40:47.834
ABOUT YESTERDAY.

40:47.835 --> 40:49.752
AH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

40:49.753 --> 40:50.670
WHAT?

40:50.671 --> 40:51.795
WELL, YOU WERE RIGHT.

40:51.796 --> 40:53.922
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
WE WERE KIDS.

40:53.923 --> 40:55.758
I SHOULDN'T HAVE MADE
SUCH A BIG DEAL OF IT.

40:55.759 --> 40:56.800
OH.

40:56.801 --> 40:57.968
OKAY, YEAH.

40:57.969 --> 40:59.511
I JUST, I HOPE IT WON'T
CHANGE YOUR MIND

40:59.512 --> 41:01.013
ABOUT HELPING OUT AROUND HERE.

41:01.014 --> 41:02.598

42:10.791 --> 42:12.708
EVERY YEAR WE CELEBRATE THE 4th

42:12.709 --> 42:14.919
WITH A BIG BARBECUE
AND COMPETITION.

42:14.920 --> 42:15.754
IT'S VERY FUN,

42:15.755 --> 42:16.879
AND DON'T FORGET

42:16.880 --> 42:18.673
TO INVITE YOUR FAMILY

THAT'S IT, EVERYBODY.
HAVE A GREAT DAY, OKAY?

42:20.801 --> 42:22.135
SEE YOU GUYS INSIDE.

42:22.136 --> 42:24.429
STAY AWAY FROM
CONNIE'S BEANS, GUYS.

42:27.182 --> 42:30.184
I DON'T REMEMBER A TIME
WHEN I WAS THIS TIRED.

42:30.185 --> 42:31.769
AH, BUT DID YOU
HAVE FUN?

42:31.770 --> 42:37.440
YOU KNOW, I HAD A REALLY
FANTASTIC TIME.

42:37.441 --> 42:39.442
LOOK.

42:39.443 --> 42:42.737
OH, WOW.

42:44.657 --> 42:46.784
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

42:50.371 --> 42:52.414
WE HAVE A VISITOR'S
CABIN, YOU KNOW.

42:52.415 --> 42:55.292
YOU COULD
STAY THE NIGHT.

42:55.293 --> 42:57.378
MM.

42:59.046 --> 43:01.299
GOOD NIGHT, LUKE.

43:05.595 --> 43:08.847
I FEEL LIKE I'VE
BEEN HERE BEFORE.

43:08.848 --> 43:10.182
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

43:10.183 --> 43:11.308
IT FEELS LIKE

43:11.309 --> 43:12.935
I'M ALWAYS
WATCHING YOU LEAVE.

43:15.229 --> 43:16.313
GOOD NIGHT.

43:16.314 --> 43:17.314
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

43:18.649 --> 43:22.402
THANK CONNIE FOR
ALL THESE CLOTHES.

43:23.487 --> 43:24.947
BYE.

44:29.260 --> 44:30.718
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
IT WOULD TAKE A FEW WEEKS

44:30.719 --> 44:32.011
TO WORK THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

44:32.012 --> 44:33.805
YEAH, APPARENTLY
THE STATE SAFETY INSPECTOR

44:33.806 --> 44:35.890
IS A LOT MORE EFFICIENT
THAN WE THOUGHT.

44:35.891 --> 44:37.267
THIS IS NUTS.

44:37.268 --> 44:40.478
"CAMP COULD POSE A HAZARD
TO THE KIDS"?

44:40.479 --> 44:41.896
YEAH, YOU KNOW,

44:41.897 --> 44:43.147
THEY'VE REALLY
RAISED THE BAR

44:43.148 --> 44:45.191
SINCE THE LAST TIME
ANYONE WAS OUT HERE.

44:45.192 --> 44:47.360
BUILDING CODES.
FIRE SAFETY.

44:47.361 --> 44:48.403
FOOD HANDLING.

44:48.404 --> 44:49.445
THEY'VE GOTTEN
A LOT MORE STRICT.

44:49.446 --> 44:51.489
"FOOT PATHS
NOT CLEARLY MARKED"?

44:51.490 --> 44:53.074
IT'S THE WOODS.

44:53.075 --> 44:54.867
HEY, MAN,
THE CAMP IS THE SAME.

44:54.868 --> 44:57.036
IT'S THE WORLD
THAT CHANGED, LUKE.

44:57.037 --> 44:58.580
THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

45:00.374 --> 45:01.916
OKAY, SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

45:01.917 --> 45:06.129
IT MEANS WE EITHER
BRING THE CAMP UP TO CODE,

45:06.130 --> 45:07.547
OR THEY SHUT US DOWN.

45:07.548 --> 45:09.090
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?

45:09.091 --> 45:10.466
4th OF JULY WEEKEND.

45:10.467 --> 45:11.509
THAT'S TWO WEEKS.

45:11.510 --> 45:13.094
CAN WE DO IT?

45:13.095 --> 45:14.013
NO.

45:14.014 --> 45:17.098
I DON'T SEE HOW.

45:21.312 --> 45:23.479
YOU KNOW, I HEARD

45:23.480 --> 45:25.148
THAT THERE WAS
SOMEONE SNIFFING AROUND.

45:25.149 --> 45:28.108
THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN BUYING THE CAMP.

45:28.109 --> 45:29.735
WHO?

45:29.736 --> 45:32.279
I DON'T KNOW, SOME
BIG-TIME DEVELOPER

45:32.280 --> 45:34.281
OUT OF SEATTLE, UH...

45:34.282 --> 45:36.074
SHOREMAN LEONARD.

45:36.075 --> 45:36.993
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO TALK TO THEM.

45:36.994 --> 45:38.118
OH, COME ON.

45:38.119 --> 45:39.119
I'M JUST SAYING,

45:39.120 --> 45:40.329
IF THEY WANT TO
MAKE US AN OFFER,

45:40.330 --> 45:41.830
MAYBE WE SHOULD HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO SAY.

45:41.831 --> 45:44.624
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
WHAT THEY HAVE TO...

45:44.625 --> 45:45.792
SHOREMAN LEONARD?

45:45.793 --> 45:48.296
YEAH. YOU HEARD OF 'EM?

45:57.180 --> 45:58.598
GOOD MORNING.

46:00.183 --> 46:01.600
WHAT'S GOING ON?

46:01.601 --> 46:05.020
YOU TELL ME.

46:05.021 --> 46:07.230
HEY... ZOE, RIGHT?

46:07.231 --> 46:09.149
YEAH.

46:09.150 --> 46:11.610
IT'S ME. IT'S TOMMY,
TOMMY ATKINS.

46:11.611 --> 46:13.153
YEAH, YEAH, HI.

46:13.154 --> 46:14.196
TOMMY, COULD YOU, UH,

46:14.197 --> 46:16.406
GIVE US
A FEW MINUTES?

46:16.407 --> 46:18.241
YEAH, SURE.

46:18.242 --> 46:19.534
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

46:19.535 --> 46:21.454
BYE.

46:25.041 --> 46:27.541
DROPPED YOUR PHONE
LAST NIGHT.

46:27.542 --> 46:29.919
A-HA...

46:29.920 --> 46:32.171
WHERE'D YOU FIND IT?

46:32.172 --> 46:34.632
I NOTICED YOUR SCREEN SAVER.

46:34.633 --> 46:36.259
SHOREMAN LEONARD?

46:38.512 --> 46:40.346
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU...

46:40.347 --> 46:41.931
WHEN? AFTER YOU HELPED THEM
BUY THE PLACE?

46:41.932 --> 46:43.307
THAT'S WHAT ALL THE PICTURES
WERE FOR, RIGHT?

46:43.308 --> 46:44.934
SO THEY COULD
LOW-BALL ME ON THE PRICE?

46:44.935 --> 46:46.477
IF I HAD KNOWN
THAT YOU OWNED THIS PLACE,

46:46.478 --> 46:48.062
I NEVER WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN INVOLVED WITH

46:48.063 --> 46:49.313
ANY OF THIS STUFF.

46:49.314 --> 46:50.981
TOMMY SAYS THESE GUYS
ARE MAJOR DEVELOPERS.

46:50.982 --> 46:54.110
I'M THINKING...
THEY DON'T DO SUMMER CAMPS.

46:54.111 --> 46:55.986
NO.

46:55.987 --> 46:57.489
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

46:58.865 --> 47:01.158
TEAR IT DOWN, AND PUT UP
A WHAT?

47:01.159 --> 47:03.160
A RESORT.

47:03.161 --> 47:05.996
YEAH.

47:11.128 --> 47:13.045
YOU'RE RIGHT,
WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER.

47:13.046 --> 47:14.548
LOOKS LIKE WE NEVER DID.

47:17.134 --> 47:18.175
AND YOU CAN

47:18.176 --> 47:19.176
TELL YOUR BOSS FOR ME,

47:19.177 --> 47:21.137
THE CAMP'S NOT FOR SALE,

47:21.138 --> 47:23.265
AND I'D LIKE YOU TO LEAVE.

47:24.723 --> 47:26.517
NOW.

48:02.595 --> 48:04.262
HEY.

48:04.263 --> 48:07.182
YOU, UH...
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT?

48:07.183 --> 48:09.434
NO.

48:11.270 --> 48:12.396
ARE YOU COMING DOWN?

48:13.564 --> 48:14.523
NO.

48:14.524 --> 48:16.692
ARE YOU EVER COMING DOWN?

48:18.068 --> 48:20.570
NO.

48:20.571 --> 48:22.614
OKAY.

48:22.615 --> 48:23.615
WHY?

48:25.492 --> 48:30.287
I'M GONNA FIX THIS ROOF
IF IT'S THE LAST THING I DO.

48:30.288 --> 48:32.289
BUT THIS ROOF
HAS ALWAYS LEAKED.

48:32.290 --> 48:33.332
AND WHY IS THAT, TOMMY?

48:33.333 --> 48:35.626
WHY DOES
THE ROOF LEAK

48:35.627 --> 48:37.336
WHEN IT'S NOT RAINING?

48:37.337 --> 48:39.463
WHY ARE THERE EVEN PIPES
ON THE ROOF ANYWAY?

48:39.464 --> 48:41.424
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!

48:42.300 --> 48:44.635
NOTHING MAKES SENSE ANYMORE.

48:48.640 --> 48:49.973
JUST GO BACK DOWN
BEFORE YOU FALL.

48:49.974 --> 48:52.476
YEAH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

48:56.814 --> 48:58.483
I'M GOOD...

49:03.780 --> 49:04.697
HEY!

49:04.698 --> 49:05.781
HEY... WHOA!

49:05.782 --> 49:08.075
I'M LOOKING FOR ZOE McDOWELL?

49:08.076 --> 49:10.202
EASY THERE, SCOOTER,
I'M NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

49:10.203 --> 49:11.286
WHAT? NO.

49:11.287 --> 49:13.330
YOU JUST...
YOU JUST STARTLED ME.

49:13.331 --> 49:15.499
JUST PART OF MY CHARM.

49:15.500 --> 49:16.708
SO, IS SHE HERE?

49:16.709 --> 49:18.210
ZOE McDOWELL?

49:18.211 --> 49:19.753
UH, UM, SHE WAS.

49:19.754 --> 49:21.380
SHE LEFT.

49:21.381 --> 49:22.881
AH! WELL, WHERE DID SHE GO?

49:23.840 --> 49:25.007
I'M NOT SURE.

49:25.008 --> 49:26.467
SHE, UH...
THERE WAS A PROBLEM.

49:26.468 --> 49:29.136
YOU MEAN LIKE THE PROBLEM
YOU AND I ARE GOING TO HAVE

49:29.137 --> 49:30.513
IF YOU DON'T STOP STARING AT ME?

49:30.514 --> 49:33.766
UH, I'M SORRY, UH...

49:33.767 --> 49:35.685
YOU JUST LOOK
REALLY FAMILIAR.

49:35.686 --> 49:37.895
DID YOU GO TO CAMP HERE?

49:37.896 --> 49:38.855
YEAH.

49:38.856 --> 49:40.189
I KNEW IT!

49:40.190 --> 49:41.399
ERICA TAFT, RIGHT?

49:41.400 --> 49:42.900
ERICA!

49:42.901 --> 49:44.151
IT'S ME.

49:44.152 --> 49:47.322
TOMMY! TOMMY ATKINS.

49:48.532 --> 49:50.366
LUKE'S GEEKY FRIEND!

49:50.367 --> 49:51.534
YES!

49:51.535 --> 49:52.535
OH, MY GOSH!

49:52.536 --> 49:54.036
I MEAN, I USED TO BE GEEKY.

49:54.037 --> 49:55.538
I'M NOT...
I'M NOT GEEKY ANYMORE...

49:55.539 --> 49:57.582
NO, IT SUITS YOU NOW!

49:57.583 --> 49:58.624
IT'S LIKE

49:58.625 --> 50:00.293
A "GOOD WITH NUMBERS" LOOK.

50:00.294 --> 50:01.877
REALLY?

50:01.878 --> 50:03.796
DEFINITELY.

50:03.797 --> 50:06.257
THANK YOU.

50:06.258 --> 50:07.341
YEAH...

THAT SHE'S-SHE'S LEFT.

59:38.194 --> 59:42.656
THEN HE SAYS, "WELL,
YOU KNOW, SHE-SHE TRIED."

59:42.657 --> 59:43.824
BUT FOR HIM,

59:43.825 --> 59:45.075
THERE WAS ALWAYS
ONE MORE BUSINESS DEAL,

59:45.076 --> 59:47.286
ONE MORE GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY,

59:47.287 --> 59:49.246
AND I THINK FINALLY
SHE HAD IT,

59:49.247 --> 59:51.081
AND SHE HAD HAD ENOUGH,
AND THEN SHE LEFT.

59:51.082 --> 59:53.959
SHE DIDN'T EVEN SAY GOODBYE?

59:53.960 --> 59:56.963
NO. I GUESS SHE THOUGHT
THAT IT WOULD BE EASIER.

01:00:01.259 --> 01:00:03.135
I'M SORRY.

01:00:03.136 --> 01:00:04.845
THEN MY DAD,

01:00:04.846 --> 01:00:10.141
UH, HE-HE JUST,
HE COULDN'T KEEP A JOB,

01:00:10.142 --> 01:00:13.102
AND HE COULDN'T
PAY THE BILLS,

01:00:13.103 --> 01:00:15.189
AND THEY TOOK OUR HOUSE.

01:00:16.857 --> 01:00:17.816
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:00:17.817 --> 01:00:19.150
HOW MANY TIMES
WE MOVED.

01:00:19.151 --> 01:00:20.944
THAT'S WHY I COULDN'T FIND YOU.

01:00:23.363 --> 01:00:25.282
I WAS SCARED.

01:00:27.492 --> 01:00:29.035
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

01:00:29.036 --> 01:00:31.288
WHEN EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVE IN
IS TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU?

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:37.251
I CAN'T RELY ON ANYBODY ELSE
BUT MYSELF,

01:00:37.252 --> 01:00:38.336
AND I MADE UP MY MIND

01:00:38.337 --> 01:00:40.087
THAT I'M NEVER GOING TO
BE LIKE MY DAD,

01:00:40.088 --> 01:00:43.216
AND THAT I'M ALWAYS
GOING TO HAVE A SAFETY NET

01:00:43.217 --> 01:00:44.258
TO FALL BACK ON.

01:00:44.259 --> 01:00:45.259
ALWAYS.

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:49.180
AND THIS... JOB WITH SHOREMAN,

01:00:49.181 --> 01:00:50.765
THAT MAKES YOU FEEL SAFE?

01:00:54.895 --> 01:00:57.188
I'M SO SORRY.

01:00:57.189 --> 01:01:00.983
I SHOULD HAVE
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH.

01:01:00.984 --> 01:01:02.693
WHEN I'M...

01:01:02.694 --> 01:01:06.947
WHEN I'M HERE WITH YOU...

01:01:06.948 --> 01:01:10.159
I JUST REMEMBER WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO TRUST SOMEONE.

01:01:11.702 --> 01:01:14.497
AND I'VE MISSED
THIS FEELING SO MUCH.

01:01:16.290 --> 01:01:18.375
ALL I... WANTED

01:01:18.376 --> 01:01:20.585
WAS ONE MORE CHANCE
TO BE HERE WITH YOU.

01:01:28.177 --> 01:01:31.137
AND I'M HERE.

01:01:31.138 --> 01:01:33.516
UM...

01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:36.893
I'VE BEEN
WAITING FOR THIS

01:01:36.894 --> 01:01:37.894
FOR A LONG TIME.

01:01:37.895 --> 01:01:40.564
NO PRESSURE.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.983
HE'S JUST WORRIED
ABOUT THE CAMP.

01:02:25.984 --> 01:02:27.401
YEAH, MAYBE.

01:02:27.402 --> 01:02:30.070
YOU KNOW...

01:02:30.071 --> 01:02:32.114
I KIND OF HAD
A LITTLE CRUSH ON YOU

01:02:32.115 --> 01:02:33.949
WAY BACK WHEN.

01:02:35.243 --> 01:02:37.494
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
TRY TO CHEER ME UP.

01:02:37.495 --> 01:02:38.495
THANK YOU...

01:02:38.496 --> 01:02:39.913
I'M SERIOUS.

01:02:39.914 --> 01:02:42.124
I JUST COULDN'T
SHOW IT OR ANYTHING.

01:02:42.125 --> 01:02:44.043
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
SO UNCOOL,

01:02:44.044 --> 01:02:46.170
GIVEN MY BASIC
CYNICAL VIEW OF LIFE

01:02:46.171 --> 01:02:48.380
AT THE TIME.

01:02:48.381 --> 01:02:49.506
NO...

01:02:49.507 --> 01:02:50.507
MM-HM.

01:02:50.508 --> 01:02:51.343
REALLY?

01:02:51.344 --> 01:02:52.760
MM-HM.

01:02:52.761 --> 01:02:55.471
I REMEMBER THINKING,
"WOW, HE'S ALWAYS THERE."

01:02:55.472 --> 01:02:58.390
I MEAN, IN A GOOD WAY.

01:02:58.391 --> 01:03:00.476
RIGHT?

01:03:00.477 --> 01:03:01.851
MM-HM.

01:03:01.852 --> 01:03:03.144
AND HOW COOL
IT WOULD BE

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:04.312
TO HAVE A FRIEND
LIKE THAT,

01:03:04.313 --> 01:03:07.690
SOMEONE YOU CAN COUNT ON
NO MATTER WHAT.

01:03:07.691 --> 01:03:10.068
I GUESS.

01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:11.277
A FRIEND WHO DOESN'T MIND

01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:13.488
ACTING LIKE
THE SIDEKICK,

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:15.198
EVEN THOUGH
ANYBODY CAN SEE,

01:03:15.199 --> 01:03:17.825
HE'S KIND OF A HERO HIMSELF.

01:03:17.826 --> 01:03:19.661
HE JUST DOESN'T LIKE TO
SHOW OFF.

01:03:22.998 --> 01:03:24.290
THINK ABOUT IT, TOMMY.

01:03:24.291 --> 01:03:27.127
WHERE WOULD LUKE BE
WITHOUT YOU?

01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:44.477
I PROMISE TO ONLY
USE MY POWERS FOR GOOD.

01:03:45.521 --> 01:03:48.022
THANK YOU.

01:03:48.023 --> 01:03:51.026
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:55.196
ZOE, IF IT WAS UP TO ME,

01:03:55.197 --> 01:03:57.407
I WOULD PUT EVERYTHING
BACK THE WAY IT WAS,

01:03:57.408 --> 01:03:59.033
SO THAT EVERY SUMMER

01:03:59.034 --> 01:04:01.243
WAS LIKE
OUR SUMMERS TOGETHER.

01:04:01.244 --> 01:04:02.203
MM-HM.

01:04:02.204 --> 01:04:04.538
YOU KNOW, WITH
THE SOUNDS AND SMELLS,

01:04:04.539 --> 01:04:08.291
AND THE WAY
IT MAKES US FEEL TO...

01:04:08.292 --> 01:04:09.668
TO ALWAYS REMEMBER.

01:04:09.669 --> 01:04:11.711
YEAH.

01:04:12.631 --> 01:04:14.214
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT?

01:04:14.215 --> 01:04:16.258
HOW...

01:04:16.259 --> 01:04:20.387
TOMMY TRIED TO WARN ME.
I JUST DIDN'T LISTEN.

01:04:20.388 --> 01:04:22.973
THE CAMP MAY BE THE SAME,
BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED.

01:04:22.974 --> 01:04:25.058
NOBODY CARES
ABOUT NATURE WALKS

01:04:25.059 --> 01:04:28.895
OR TYING KNOTS
OR-OR BONFIRES...

01:04:28.896 --> 01:04:32.482
BUT THAT'S WHAT MAKES
THIS CAMP SO SPECIAL.

01:04:32.483 --> 01:04:34.067
CAMP'S NOT ABOUT
THAT STUFF ANYMORE.

01:04:34.068 --> 01:04:35.735
THEY'RE ABOUT,
YOU KNOW, COMPUTERS

01:04:35.736 --> 01:04:37.404
OR THEATER

01:04:37.405 --> 01:04:41.658
OR TRAINING TO BE
THE NEXT SPORTS SUPERSTAR.

01:04:41.659 --> 01:04:42.577
NO, YOU'RE WRONG.

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.077
PEOPLE DO CARE.

01:04:44.078 --> 01:04:47.622
THEY JUST-THEY JUST
NEED TO BE REMINDED.

01:04:47.623 --> 01:04:49.916
I FOUND THIS CAMP AGAIN,

01:04:49.917 --> 01:04:55.047
AND I AM NOT GONNA
LET YOU GIVE UP ON IT.

01:04:57.133 --> 01:04:59.341
A SUMMER TO REMEMBER.

01:04:59.342 --> 01:05:00.719
COME ON.

01:05:04.681 --> 01:05:06.391
NO...

01:05:20.739 --> 01:05:23.115
HI.

01:05:23.116 --> 01:05:24.783
HEY.

01:05:24.784 --> 01:05:26.619
HEY.

01:05:28.455 --> 01:05:29.622
IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU GUYS

01:05:29.623 --> 01:05:32.333
FINALLY OPEN UP
LIKE THIS.

01:05:32.334 --> 01:05:34.460
WOW. DEFINITELY.

01:05:34.461 --> 01:05:35.628
ARE YOU
FEELING IT?

01:05:35.629 --> 01:05:39.131
BECAUSE I AM SO
FEELING IT.

01:05:39.132 --> 01:05:40.299
I AM DEFINITELY FEELING

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:42.343
A MALE BONDING VIBE
GOING ON.

01:05:42.344 --> 01:05:43.427
I THINK THAT

01:05:43.428 --> 01:05:45.721
WE NEED TO LEAVE
THESE TWO MEN ALONE.

01:05:45.722 --> 01:05:48.140
ABSOLUTELY.

01:05:48.141 --> 01:05:50.643
YOU GUYS SHOULD
TAKE YOUR TIME.

01:05:50.644 --> 01:05:52.854
WE'LL BE INSIDE, OKAY?

01:06:01.695 --> 01:06:03.363
SO...

01:06:03.364 --> 01:06:07.158
YOU AND, UH, ERICA?

01:06:07.159 --> 01:06:09.536
YEAH, GO FIGURE.

01:06:09.537 --> 01:06:11.579
AND YOU AND ZOE?

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:12.747
WE'RE GOOD.

01:06:12.748 --> 01:06:13.748
GOOD.

01:06:13.749 --> 01:06:15.375
JUST LIKE OLD TIMES.

01:06:15.376 --> 01:06:17.628
YUP.

01:06:19.088 --> 01:06:21.631
MAYBE WE COULD, UH,

01:06:21.632 --> 01:06:23.341
DOUBLE-DATE FOR PROM?

01:06:23.342 --> 01:06:24.634
I COULD BORROW
MY OLD MAN'S CAR.

01:06:27.471 --> 01:06:29.640
NAH, THAT'S STUPID.

01:06:30.432 --> 01:06:35.604
LOOK, UH, TOMMY, UH...

01:06:36.689 --> 01:06:38.482
I'M A JERK.

01:06:40.276 --> 01:06:42.068
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:44.487
YOU'RE A LITTLE TOO PASSIONATE
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD SOMETIMES,

01:06:44.488 --> 01:06:45.780
BUT YOU'RE NOT A JERK.

01:06:45.781 --> 01:06:49.368
YEAH, WELL, EITHER WAY...

01:06:50.869 --> 01:06:53.414
I'M-I'M SORRY.

01:06:55.374 --> 01:06:56.666
I'M SORRY TOO.

01:07:09.554 --> 01:07:11.263
SHOREMAN,
THERE'S A JERK.

01:07:11.264 --> 01:07:12.389
YEAH.

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:13.432
FOR THE RECORD,

01:07:13.433 --> 01:07:15.475
I WOULD NEVER WORK
FOR THAT GUY.

01:07:15.476 --> 01:07:17.603
WE MAY BOTH END UP
WORKING FOR HIM

01:07:17.604 --> 01:07:19.313
WHEN THIS IS OVER.

01:07:19.314 --> 01:07:20.480
COME ON.

01:07:20.481 --> 01:07:22.566
WE'LL DO IT
JUST THE WAY WE ALWAYS HAVE,

01:07:22.567 --> 01:07:24.067
WITH ONE BIG DIFFERENCE.

01:07:24.068 --> 01:07:25.694
WE'VE GOT RECORDS
FROM THE LAST 50 YEARS

01:07:25.695 --> 01:07:27.404
IN THAT OFFICE.

01:07:27.405 --> 01:07:28.822
WE'LL INVITE EVERYONE
WHO'S EVER GONE TO CAMP HERE.

01:07:28.823 --> 01:07:30.574
INVITE THEM TO WHAT?

01:07:30.575 --> 01:07:32.326
TO THIS YEAR'S
4th OF JULY BARBECUE

01:07:32.327 --> 01:07:34.369
AND DECATHLON GAMES CELEBRATION.

01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:36.163
BUT THE CAMP'S
CLOSING, LUKE.

01:07:36.164 --> 01:07:37.706
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY FEELS MUCH
LIKE CELEBRATING,

01:07:37.707 --> 01:07:38.583
SWEETIE.

01:07:38.584 --> 01:07:39.708
THAT'S THE POINT.

01:07:39.709 --> 01:07:41.418
IF CAMP PINE LAKE
IS CLOSING ANYWAY,

01:07:41.419 --> 01:07:42.586
LET'S GIVE EVERYONE

01:07:42.587 --> 01:07:45.505
THE GREATEST 4th OF JULY
IN CAMP HISTORY.

01:07:45.506 --> 01:07:47.841
OKAY, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THEY'LL SHOW UP?

01:07:47.842 --> 01:07:49.426
THEY'RE GOING TO COME

01:07:49.427 --> 01:07:50.761
BECAUSE CAMP
IS THE ONE PLACE

01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:52.179
AND THE ONE TIME
IN OUR LIVES

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.430
WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT
ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE.

01:07:53.431 --> 01:07:55.264
NO MATTER HOW MUCH
THE WORLD CHANGES,

01:07:55.265 --> 01:07:56.766
THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME.

01:07:56.767 --> 01:07:58.351
THAT'S RIGHT,
SO THEY'LL COME BACK,

01:07:58.352 --> 01:08:00.061
JUST ONE LAST TIME.

01:08:00.062 --> 01:08:02.355

WE'D BETTER GET BUSY.

01:08:02.356 --> 01:08:04.273

THE BEST TIME...

01:18:40.399 --> 01:18:42.733
YEAH, I-I KNOW.

01:18:42.734 --> 01:18:44.986
HONEY, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU

01:18:44.987 --> 01:18:46.237
A LONG TIME AGO,

01:18:46.238 --> 01:18:48.155
AND...

01:18:48.156 --> 01:18:52.785
I KNOW I HAVEN'T BEEN THERE
FOR YOU OVER THE YEARS,

01:18:52.786 --> 01:18:54.453
AND I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE EXCUSES,

01:18:54.454 --> 01:18:56.747
BUT IT WAS WRONG FOR ME
TO LET YOU DOWN

01:18:56.748 --> 01:18:59.250
AND DESERT YOU LIKE...
SHE DESERTED US,

01:18:59.251 --> 01:19:00.960
AND FOR THAT,

01:19:00.961 --> 01:19:02.878
I AM SO SORRY.

01:19:02.879 --> 01:19:04.505
DAD, I-I DON'T KNOW...

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.382
LOOK...

01:19:06.383 --> 01:19:11.012
SWEETHEART,
YOU'RE ALL I'VE GOT LEFT,

01:19:11.013 --> 01:19:14.682
AND, BOY,

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.060
I'D GIVE ANYTHING
TO HAVE ANOTHER CHANCE.

01:19:22.107 --> 01:19:24.984
YOU KNOW, IT WAS HERE...

01:19:24.985 --> 01:19:26.777
WHEN YOU PICKED ME UP

01:19:26.778 --> 01:19:29.530
THAT EVERYTHING JUST STARTED
TO GET SO MESSED UP.

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:32.200
I KNOW.

01:19:35.954 --> 01:19:38.080
SO IT MAKES SENSE
THAT IT'S HERE...

01:19:41.500 --> 01:19:44.127
...THAT WE START TO TRY

01:19:44.128 --> 01:19:46.297
TO PUT THINGS BACK TOGETHER.

01:19:47.465 --> 01:19:48.591
I LOVE YOU, BABY.

01:19:51.177 --> 01:19:53.429
I LOVE YOU, DAD.

01:19:56.307 --> 01:20:00.060
OH, I'VE MISSED THIS.

01:20:00.061 --> 01:20:02.438
♪ ♪

01:20:03.981 --> 01:20:05.315
WE HAVE THE RESULTS!

01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:10.320
OKAY, ALL RIGHT...

01:20:10.321 --> 01:20:12.572
UH, DOZEN EGGS,
CARTON OF MILK,

SACK OF ORANGES...

01:20:13.866 --> 01:20:16.451
WAIT, ZOE, THIS IS
YOUR GROCERY LIST.

01:20:16.452 --> 01:20:17.452
SORRY.

01:20:17.453 --> 01:20:18.453
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:20:18.454 --> 01:20:19.496
- SORRY.

01:20:19.497 --> 01:20:21.122
ALSO, YOU GUYS, I WANT TO SAY,

01:20:21.123 --> 01:20:23.500
I KNOW WE GOT
A LITTLE WET EARLIER,

01:20:23.501 --> 01:20:24.501
BUT YOU GUYS HAD FUN, RIGHT?

01:20:24.502 --> 01:20:26.127
YEAH!

01:20:27.505 --> 01:20:28.630
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,

01:20:28.631 --> 01:20:30.173
HERE WE GO.

01:20:30.174 --> 01:20:31.050
THE PANTHERS...

01:20:31.051 --> 01:20:33.343
WON THAT TUG-OF-WAR...

01:20:34.595 --> 01:20:35.512
ARCHERY,

01:20:35.513 --> 01:20:38.013
THE SACK RACE, THE SALAD TOSS,

01:20:38.014 --> 01:20:39.014
AND BADMINTON.

01:20:42.185 --> 01:20:43.061
AND...

01:20:43.062 --> 01:20:44.144
THE BOBCATS...

01:20:44.145 --> 01:20:45.562
THE THREE-LEGGED RACE,

01:20:45.563 --> 01:20:47.272
CAPTURE-THE-FLAG,

01:20:47.273 --> 01:20:50.859
VOLLEYBALL, EGG-IN-A-SPOON...

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.237
TOMMY, YOU CHEATED A LITTLE...

01:20:53.238 --> 01:20:54.279
NO, I DID NOT.

01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:55.323
YES, HE DID!

01:20:56.282 --> 01:20:57.075
AND DODGEBALL,

01:20:57.076 --> 01:20:58.409
SO THAT'S FIVE EACH.
IT'S A TIE!

01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:02.371
HEY, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU GUYS.

01:21:02.372 --> 01:21:05.874
UH, THERE'S REFRESHMENTS
AND SNACKS IN THE MESS HALL,

01:21:05.875 --> 01:21:08.210
AND THEN, UH, BE BACK IN AN HOUR
FOR THE FIREWORKS SHOW.

01:21:08.211 --> 01:21:10.337
WAIT, HOLD ON,

01:21:10.338 --> 01:21:11.547
EVERYBODY.

01:21:11.548 --> 01:21:12.923
I WANT YOU GUYS
TO GIVE

01:21:12.924 --> 01:21:14.341
A ROUND OF APPLAUSE

01:21:14.342 --> 01:21:16.135
TO A FRIEND OF THE CAMP, PETE.

01:21:17.054 --> 01:21:18.178
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

01:21:18.179 --> 01:21:19.388
I HOPE YOU KIDS
HAD A GOOD DAY,

01:21:19.389 --> 01:21:21.932
'CAUSE UNFORTUNATELY,
THE FUN IS OVER.

01:21:21.933 --> 01:21:23.225
LUKE, THIS IS

01:21:23.226 --> 01:21:25.394
ANDREW TEMPLETON AT
THE STATE SAFETY OFFICE.

01:21:25.395 --> 01:21:26.395
THIS IS LUKE GARVEY.

01:21:26.396 --> 01:21:28.522
- HEY.
- HOW YOU DOING?

01:21:28.523 --> 01:21:29.606
SOON TO BE
FORMER OWNER

01:21:29.607 --> 01:21:31.024
OF CAMP PINE LAKE.

01:21:31.025 --> 01:21:32.234
RIGHT?

01:21:32.235 --> 01:21:33.235
I TOOK A WALK
AROUND THE CAMP.

01:21:33.236 --> 01:21:34.360
YOU'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK

01:21:34.361 --> 01:21:35.403
SINCE THE LAST TIME
I WAS HERE.

01:21:35.404 --> 01:21:36.571
WE'VE HAD
A LOT OF HELP.

01:21:36.572 --> 01:21:37.947
PEOPLE WANT
TO KEEP THIS CAMP OPEN.

01:21:37.948 --> 01:21:39.240
BUT I'M AFRAID

01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:41.242
THERE'S STILL
A LOT MORE TO DO.

01:21:41.243 --> 01:21:42.410
AND WE'RE GOING TO
GET IT DONE,

01:21:42.411 --> 01:21:43.911
WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME.

01:21:43.912 --> 01:21:45.079
WELL, THAT'S
UNFORTUNATELY

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:47.206
ONE OF THE THINGS
YOU DON'T HAVE.

01:21:47.207 --> 01:21:48.291
MR. TEMPLETON,
IF YOU WOULD.

01:21:48.292 --> 01:21:49.500
THE LETTER, PLEASE.

01:21:49.501 --> 01:21:51.085
THIS PRETTY MUCH
MAKES IT OFFICIAL,

01:21:51.086 --> 01:21:52.796
AS OF MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

01:21:54.506 --> 01:21:55.923
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

01:21:55.924 --> 01:21:57.258
LOOK AT
ALL THESE KIDS.

01:21:57.259 --> 01:21:59.010
THEY GOTTA GROW UP
SOMETIME, DON'T THEY?

01:21:59.011 --> 01:22:01.345
THESE RUGRATS MIGHT AS WELL
LEARN IT NOW, RIGHT?

01:22:01.346 --> 01:22:03.598
THAT'S IT, PAL,
YOU'RE GOING DOWN.

01:22:03.599 --> 01:22:05.183
NO, NO, LISTEN,

01:22:05.184 --> 01:22:06.309
MAYBE WE CAN KEEP
THE CAMP OPEN ALL SUMMER.

01:22:06.310 --> 01:22:07.435
I-I CAN SHOW YOU THE NAMES.

01:22:07.436 --> 01:22:08.478
AND ANY SAFETY ISSUES,

01:22:08.479 --> 01:22:09.604
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM...

01:22:09.605 --> 01:22:10.646
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE,
NO CAN DO.

01:22:10.647 --> 01:22:11.523
A LITTLE LATE.

01:22:11.524 --> 01:22:13.024
I'M AFRAID
HE'S RIGHT.

01:22:13.025 --> 01:22:14.775
THE OFFICE IS REALLY STRICT
WITH COMPLIANCE.

01:22:14.776 --> 01:22:16.194
I'M SORRY.

01:22:16.195 --> 01:22:18.155
IF IT WAS UP TO ME, I'D...

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:23.409
BYE, ANDY!

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:25.370
SEE YOU NEXT SUMMER!

01:22:26.789 --> 01:22:28.123
ANDY TEMPLETON?

01:22:29.333 --> 01:22:31.000
TOMMY, IT'S ANDY!

01:22:31.001 --> 01:22:33.877
REMEMBER?
THE ROPE BRIDGE? ANDY!

01:22:33.878 --> 01:22:36.630
HE DIDN'T RECOGNIZE
THE POISON IVY, REMEMBER?

01:22:36.631 --> 01:22:38.298
AND HE WOULDN'T GO
ON THE ROPE BRIDGE.

01:22:38.299 --> 01:22:39.633
OH, YEAH!

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.469
IT TOOK YOU ALL SUMMER, DUDE!

01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:44.804
YOU GUYS REALLY REMEMBER THAT?

01:22:44.805 --> 01:22:46.431
REMEMBER WHAT?

01:22:46.432 --> 01:22:47.807
YOU FINALLY MADE IT ACROSS,
AND WE COULDN'T GET YOU DOWN.

01:22:47.808 --> 01:22:48.809
YOU WERE LIKE A MADMAN.

01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:50.143
YOU WERE CRAZY!

01:22:50.144 --> 01:22:51.436
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU REALLY REMEMBER THAT.

01:22:51.437 --> 01:22:54.648
I WAS TERRIFIED OF HEIGHTS
BEFORE THAT.

01:22:54.649 --> 01:22:56.691
YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT I SKY-DIVE NOW.

01:22:56.692 --> 01:22:57.734
THAT'S AWESOME!

01:22:57.735 --> 01:22:58.694
WOW!

01:22:58.695 --> 01:23:00.195
- THAT'S GREAT.
- THAT'S GREAT.

01:23:01.656 --> 01:23:04.241
THAT WAS THE BEST SUMMER
OF MY LIFE,

01:23:04.242 --> 01:23:05.201
THANKS TO YOU GUYS.

01:23:05.201 --> 01:23:06.160
AND THE CAMP.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.078
YEP.

01:23:07.079 --> 01:23:09.579
RIGHT.

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:12.749
OH, WONDERFUL.

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:14.000
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

01:23:14.001 --> 01:23:15.502
WE CAN'T CLOSE
THIS PLACE DOWN.

01:23:15.503 --> 01:23:16.586
NO!

01:23:16.587 --> 01:23:17.921
NO, WE HAVE TO
CLOSE THIS PLACE DOWN.

01:23:17.922 --> 01:23:19.297
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:20.715
THERE WERE SAFETY
ISSUES EVERYWHERE...

01:23:20.716 --> 01:23:21.676
WHICH WE CAN FIX.

01:23:21.677 --> 01:23:23.218
- YEAH!
- OF COURSE.

01:23:23.219 --> 01:23:24.469
BUT THE KIDS CAN'T BE HERE
WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT,

01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:25.595
THAT MUCH I DO KNOW FOR SURE.

01:23:25.596 --> 01:23:27.681
RIGHT, THE CAMPERS
WILL BE AWAY

01:23:27.682 --> 01:23:28.682
WHILE WE GET THINGS
UP TO CODE.

01:23:28.683 --> 01:23:30.225
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE?

01:23:30.226 --> 01:23:31.308
IT'LL TAKE A WEEK.

01:23:31.309 --> 01:23:32.518
OBVIOUSLY,
WE'LL NEED SOME HELP.

01:23:32.519 --> 01:23:33.561
YEAH, WE CAN PUSH
THE SUMMER SESSION

01:23:33.562 --> 01:23:34.687
BACK A LITTLE BIT.

01:23:34.688 --> 01:23:37.106
I CAN BUY YOU A WEEK,

01:23:37.107 --> 01:23:38.274
IF YOU LET ME HELP.

01:23:39.234 --> 01:23:40.193
YOU GOT A DEAL.

01:23:40.194 --> 01:23:41.443
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:23:41.444 --> 01:23:42.528
NO, NO, HOLD ON
A SECOND.

01:23:42.529 --> 01:23:43.779
FOCUS ON
THE TASK AT HAND.

01:23:43.780 --> 01:23:45.406
IF YOU DON'T
CLOSE THIS PLACE,

01:23:45.407 --> 01:23:46.490
I'M REPORTING YOU,

01:23:46.491 --> 01:23:48.158
AND YOU CAN KISS
YOUR JOB GOODBYE.

01:23:48.159 --> 01:23:49.159
THEN WHAT?

01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:50.703
FOCUS ON
THE TASK AT HAND.

01:23:50.704 --> 01:23:52.705
MAKE HIM SIGN
THAT THING...

01:23:52.706 --> 01:23:54.415
KNOW WHAT I ALSO
REMEMBER FROM CAMP?

01:23:54.416 --> 01:23:55.624
WHAT?

01:23:55.625 --> 01:23:57.376
REMEMBER WHAT WE USED TO DO
TO THE NEW GUY?

01:23:57.377 --> 01:23:59.253

01:23:59.254 --> 01:24:00.754
