WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:04.004
-PREVIOUSLY ON "BATWOMAN"...
-RYAN'S ONLY HOPE

00:04.047 --> 00:06.397
IS THE DESERT ROSE,
WHICH IS ON CORYANA
WITH KATE.

00:06.441 --> 00:07.964
-WHO'S SAFIYAH?
-THE WOMAN WHO HAS MY DAUGHTER.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.705
WE CAN'T LOCATE HER,
BUT SINCE THIS WAS

00:09.748 --> 00:11.315
THE LAST THING
ON KATE'S PHONE,
WE THINK IT WILL HELP.

00:11.359 --> 00:12.664
THE MANY ARMS
WILL KILL WHOEVER

00:12.708 --> 00:14.014
LAYS HANDS
ON THAT PAINTING.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.711
YOU'LL NEVER FIND
CORYANA.

00:15.754 --> 00:18.322
THE PAINTING GETS US
TO CORYANA? IS IT A MAP?

00:26.287 --> 00:29.594
AAH! IT FEELS LIKE
MY BRAIN IS HEMORRHAGING.

00:29.638 --> 00:31.379
IT'S EVEN NASTIER
SINCE YESTERDAY.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.207
IT KIND OF REEKS, TOO.
IT KIND OF--

00:33.250 --> 00:35.426
THANKS, LUKE!
VERY HELPFUL!

00:35.470 --> 00:37.037
OK. REMEMBER
A FEW DAYS AGO WHEN I DELETED

00:37.080 --> 00:39.213
HALF THE DVR TO
MAKE ROOM FOR YOUR SHOWS?

00:39.256 --> 00:41.998
-WHAT?
-JUST REMEMBER YOU LIKE ME, OK?

00:58.580 --> 01:00.495
-WHAT THE HELL JUST HAPPENED?
-I AM TRYING REALLY HARD

01:00.538 --> 01:02.366
NOT TO SERIOUSLY
FREAK OUT RIGHT NOW,

01:02.410 --> 01:03.498
BUT I'M PRETTY SURE
THE KRYPTONITE

01:03.541 --> 01:05.239
JUST ENTERED HER BRAIN.

01:15.597 --> 01:17.468
I NOT ONLY
HAVE TO FLY TO GOTHAM,

01:17.512 --> 01:19.514
BUT THEN YOU MAKE ME
WADE THROUGH A MILE

01:19.557 --> 01:21.733
OF RABID RATS
TO FIND YOU?

01:21.777 --> 01:23.387
IT'S A WEE BIT REMOTE,

01:23.431 --> 01:25.520
BUT THESE TYPES OF PLACES
KIND OF HAVE TO BE.

01:25.563 --> 01:31.134
THIS WAS OCEAN'S
SMOKE-OUT, WU-WU
MEDITATION SPOT.

01:31.178 --> 01:32.570
WAS?

01:32.614 --> 01:35.965
AS PROMISED,
TATIANA.

01:36.008 --> 01:40.535
I THINK YOU'LL FIND
THE OCEAN IS DEAD CALM.

01:40.578 --> 01:43.755
GOT TO ADMIT I DIDN'T
THINK YOU HAD IT IN YOU.

01:43.799 --> 01:45.496
UNH!

01:45.540 --> 01:49.413
YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T
BE THINKING AT ALL, TATIANA.

01:49.457 --> 01:51.981
IT'S NOT YOUR STRONG SUIT.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.026
I NEVER WOULD
HAVE TRADED THAT MAP
FOR ALICE

01:54.070 --> 01:55.854
IF I'D KNOWN I'D BE
FORCED TO HAND IT
RIGHT BACK OVER

01:55.898 --> 01:57.160
TO A BUNCH OF THUGS.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.249
SOME HIGHLY PAID THUGS
IT TURNS OUT.

01:59.293 --> 02:02.687
AARON HELZINGER WANTED
THE DESERT ROSE TO HEAL
HIS DAMAGED AMYGDALA.

02:02.731 --> 02:04.341
HE ALSO CLAIMED THAT
HAMILTON DOCTORS

02:04.385 --> 02:05.864
HAD BEEN EXPERIMENTING
ON HIS BRAIN.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.866
WE CAN ASSUME
THOSE SAME DOCTORS

02:07.910 --> 02:10.826
WERE THE ONES WHO
SENT HIM TO MARY AND ME
FOR MORE ANTIDOTE.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.654
THESE ARE ALL
THE DOCTORS HE'S SEEN?

02:12.697 --> 02:14.873
YEAH. MOST OF THEM
WORK FOR UPSTANDING
REGIONAL HOSPITALS

02:14.917 --> 02:17.311
EXCEPT ONE--
DR. ETHAN ROGERS.

02:17.354 --> 02:21.271
ROGERS WAS HELZINGER'S
LAST KNOWN NEUROLOGIST,
WORKED IN A LAB.

02:21.315 --> 02:23.447
APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN
RUNNING OFF-THE-GRID
MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.536
YOU THINK ROGERS
WAS RESPONSIBLE
FOR TAKING THE MAP?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.234
WE FOUND THAT
GARNICK LOGISTICS WAS OWNED

02:27.277 --> 02:30.454
BY AN OFFSHORE COMPANY HELD
BY HAMILTON DYNAMICS.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.152
IT APPEARS WE HAVE
UNEARTHED YET ANOTHER

02:32.195 --> 02:35.024
OF CATHERINE'S
DIRTY, LITTLE SECRETS.

02:35.067 --> 02:37.940
-LET'S GO GET THAT MAP, SIR.
-LET'S GO GET THAT MAP.

02:37.983 --> 02:40.725
GOOD MORNING,
MY LITTLE LESBIAN PET.

02:45.513 --> 02:47.167
WHAT IS THIS?

02:47.210 --> 02:49.908
OH, THIS? YEAH.
THIS IS STORYTIME.

02:49.952 --> 02:53.042
SEE, YOU ARE
GOING TO TAKE ME
DOWN MEMORYLESS LANE,

02:53.085 --> 02:55.305
TELL ME THE WHO, WHAT,
WHERE, AND WHY

02:55.349 --> 02:58.830
OCEAN AND I WEREEXPERIENCING FLEETING MOMENTS

02:58.874 --> 03:00.180
OF FORGOTTEN MEMORY.

03:00.223 --> 03:03.095
DOES IT REALLY MATTER?
HE'S DEAD.

03:03.139 --> 03:05.228
YEAH. WELL, I THINK
YOU'LL FIND YOU HAVE
THAT IN COMMON

03:05.272 --> 03:06.925
IF YOU DON'T START
TALKING!

03:06.969 --> 03:08.884
THOUGHT YOU'D FIGURED IT
OUT BY NOW.

03:08.927 --> 03:12.627
SAFIYAH HAD
YOUR MEMORIES WIPED.

03:12.670 --> 03:16.718
I KNOW, BUT SAFIYAH
RULES OVER AN ISLAND.

03:16.761 --> 03:18.807
I WAS AN ORPHAN
RUNAWAY.

03:18.850 --> 03:21.723
WHAT WAS SO THREATENING
ABOUT LITTLE OLD ME?

03:21.766 --> 03:25.205
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MADE
YOU A THREAT,

03:25.248 --> 03:28.643
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT MADE YOU APPEALING.

03:28.686 --> 03:32.690
YOU AND SAFIYAH HAD
A COMMON ENEMY.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.606
CATHERINE HAMILTON?
I REMEMBER.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.695
AFTER CATHERINE
BURNED SAFIYAH

03:37.739 --> 03:39.784
ON AN ISLAND
DEFENSE SYSTEM,

03:39.828 --> 03:43.266
SAFIYAH INSTRUCTED US
TO STEAL ONE OF HER YACHTS

03:43.310 --> 03:45.747
TO TEACH HER A LESSON.

03:45.790 --> 03:49.272
TURNS OUT VENGEFUL MINDS
THINK ALIKE

03:49.316 --> 03:52.580
BECAUSE WE FOUND YOU
STOWED AWAY IN THE CABIN,

03:52.623 --> 03:57.237
WEARING HER CLOTHES,
SWILLING HER 5-FIGURE
BOTTLES OF CHAMPAGNE.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.026
WHY THE HELL
AM I HERE?

04:04.069 --> 04:05.941
CAN I KILL
HER NOW?

04:08.770 --> 04:11.381
LEAVE US, PLEASE.

04:11.425 --> 04:13.557
SHE'S A FILTHY
OUTSIDER.

04:13.601 --> 04:14.993
WE HAVE NO USE
FOR HER.

04:15.037 --> 04:16.168
SHE IS MY PRISONER.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.953
I WILL DEAL WITH HER
MY WAY.

04:17.996 --> 04:20.216
YOU FOUGHT OFF 4
OF MY MEN

04:20.260 --> 04:21.870
BEFORE WE PUT YOU DOWN.

04:21.913 --> 04:24.742
TO ME, YOU WERE
A FERAL ANIMAL,

04:24.786 --> 04:27.963
BUT TO SAFIYAH,
YOU WERE SOMETHING ELSE.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.531
YOU WERE SPECIAL.

04:33.011 --> 04:37.102
RELAX. I'M NOT
GOING TO HURT YOU,

04:37.146 --> 04:40.280
AND FROM THE LOOKS
OF WHAT YOU DID
TO MY MEN,

04:40.323 --> 04:42.717
I WOULDN'T STAND
A CHANCE.

04:42.760 --> 04:44.849
WHY AM I HERE?

04:44.893 --> 04:47.156
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:47.199 --> 04:49.680
FIRST, I'D
LIKE TO KNOW WHY
A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN

04:49.724 --> 04:52.117
WITH HER ENTIRE LIFE
AHEAD OF HER

04:52.161 --> 04:53.815
WAS FOUND SEQUESTERED
AWAY ON A BOAT

04:53.858 --> 04:55.730
FLOATING IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

04:55.773 --> 04:59.516
LET'S JUST SAY I'VE
GROWN ACCUSTOMED
TO SMALL SPACES.

04:59.560 --> 05:04.042
THE REAL WORLD CAN BE
AN OVERWHELMING PLACE
SOMETIMES.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.783
I UNDERSTAND WE BOTH
HAVE A BONE TO PICK

05:05.827 --> 05:08.308
WITH CATHERINE
HAMILTON-KANE.

05:08.351 --> 05:12.529
SHE CONVINCED
MY ENTIRE FAMILY

05:12.573 --> 05:18.318
I WAS DEAD WHILE I SPENT
THE LAST 11 YEARS

05:18.361 --> 05:20.755
IN MY KIDNAPPER'S
BASEMENT CELL.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.324
AND HERE YOU ARE,

05:24.367 --> 05:28.110
A SIREN ONCE TRAPPED
IN A NET,

05:28.153 --> 05:30.591
WHO SOMEHOW FOUND
HER WAY OUT.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.552
SAFIYAH LIKED YOU
BECAUSE SHE WAS INSPIRED BY YOU.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.076
WHATEVER STORY YOU TOLD HER
OF YOUR CAPTIVITY,

05:38.120 --> 05:40.557
YOU DID THE ONE THING
SHE NEVER COULD...

05:42.429 --> 05:45.519
ESCAPE. SHE WOULD NEVER
ADMIT IT,

05:45.562 --> 05:49.871
BUT TO THIS DAY,
SHE CONSIDERS HERSELF
A PRISONER OF CORYANA.

05:49.914 --> 05:51.742
OH. POOR THING.

05:51.786 --> 05:54.528
IT MUST BE SO HARD
BEING HANDED A KINGDOM,

05:54.571 --> 05:56.530
BUT I REMEMBER
ALL OF THIS.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.183
WHEN DID OCEAN
FACTOR IN?

05:58.227 --> 06:02.057
WHEN SAFIYAH REALIZED
YOU HAD PURPOSE.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.364
TECHNICALLY,
YOU WERE OUR PRISONER,

06:04.407 --> 06:07.584
BUT SHE WANTED TO HARNESS
THE RAGE YOU HAD FOR CATHERINE

06:07.628 --> 06:10.544
BY MAKING YOU ONE
OF HER LOYAL SOLDIERS

06:10.587 --> 06:15.766
EXCEPT YOU WERE
AN UNTAMED AND ANGRY GIRL.

06:15.810 --> 06:18.203
YOU NEEDED DISCIPLINE.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.819
AND SAFIYAH KNEW EXACTLY
WHO WOULD TEACH YOU

06:24.862 --> 06:27.125
HOW TO BE A GOOD,
LITTLE SOLDIER.

06:32.217 --> 06:34.698
OCEAN.

06:37.309 --> 06:39.137
HI.

06:39.181 --> 06:42.358
-TATIANA,
-THERE ARE
VERY FEW RULES ON OUR ISLAND--

06:42.402 --> 06:47.581
NO LEAVING, NO STEALING
THE DESERT ROSE,

06:47.624 --> 06:51.367
AND IF SAFIYAH WANTS
SOMETHING, SHE GETS IT,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.891
AND SAFIYAH WANTED
YOUR LOYALTY

06:53.935 --> 06:56.198
SO THAT AFTER YOU WENT HOME
TO GOTHAM

06:56.241 --> 06:58.418
TO GET REVENGE
AGAINST YOUR FAMILY

06:58.461 --> 07:01.551
YOU WOULD COME BACK
AND JOIN HERS.

07:01.595 --> 07:04.249
AND WHAT DID I WANT?

07:04.293 --> 07:07.209
YOU WANTED OCEAN.

07:16.523 --> 07:18.655
MARY,
HEY. COME HERE.

07:18.699 --> 07:20.352
SOPHIE THINKS THEY
MIGHT KNOW WHO
TOOK THE MAP.

07:20.396 --> 07:22.224
THEY'RE BRINGING
AN ARMY OF CROWS
TO HIS WORK.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.573
SO WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
DOES RYAN SUIT UP

07:23.617 --> 07:24.966
AND JUMP ON THE JET
WITH THEM?

07:25.009 --> 07:26.576
NO. SHE'S NEVER
GONNA MAKE IT.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.230
SHE HAS ACUTE RADIATION.

07:28.273 --> 07:30.058
HER BONE MARROW
IS DISINTEGRATING.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.799
HER CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
IS FAILING.

07:31.842 --> 07:33.801
OK. SO WHAT DO YOU
SUGGEST?

07:33.844 --> 07:35.193
I THINK WE NEED TO ASK
MY DAD TO BRING

07:35.237 --> 07:37.108
A FLOWER BACK
WITH KATE.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.459
IF HE FINDS THE MAP
AND IF HE GETS THERE IN TIME,

07:39.502 --> 07:42.026
NOT TO MENTION, MARY,
THAT THE MAN JUST
SHUT DOWN YOUR CLINIC.

07:42.070 --> 07:43.463
-I KNOW.
-HOW DO YOU THINK HE'LL REACT TO

07:43.506 --> 07:44.768
FINDING OUT THAT YOU'RE
ON THE BAT TEAM?

07:44.812 --> 07:47.031
I'M STILL IN
THE BRAINSTORMING PHASE.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.687
OH!

07:50.731 --> 07:52.297
RYAN!

08:02.307 --> 08:04.571
SO YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT...

08:04.614 --> 08:08.270
A LITTLE CRUSH
ON THE FIRST CUTE BOY
I LAID EYES ON

08:08.313 --> 08:11.534
AFTER ESCAPING CAPTIVITY
FOR 11 YEARS

08:11.578 --> 08:15.190
THREW THE ISLAND QUEEN
INTO A TIZZY?

08:15.233 --> 08:17.714
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT.

08:17.758 --> 08:21.762
IN FACT, AT FIRST,
NO ONE EVEN NOTICED.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.328
LET ME GUESS-

08:23.372 --> 08:25.635
CLANDESTINE TRYSTS
BY THE WATER WELL?

08:25.679 --> 08:29.726
NO. THE REASON
NO ONE NOTICED

08:29.770 --> 08:32.120
WAS BECAUSE YOU TWO
HATED EACH OTHER.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.645
UNH!

08:35.689 --> 08:36.951
NOW USE MY WEIGHT
AGAINST ME.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.520
UNH!

08:43.871 --> 08:45.525
AAH! OHH!

08:49.920 --> 08:51.487
THE GAME
IS NEVER OVER.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.749
WHAT'S THE POINT
OF THIS?

08:52.793 --> 08:54.751
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD
OF A GUN?

08:54.795 --> 08:57.058
GUNS CAN JAM,
GET TAKEN.

08:57.101 --> 08:58.494
THE REAL FIGHT
IS IN HERE,

08:58.538 --> 09:00.888
AND THAT THEY CAN'T
TAKE AWAY.

09:00.931 --> 09:04.369
PREPARATION, ENGAGEMENT,
COMMITMENT.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.068
SURRENDERING TO FALSE GODS
AND IDEOLOGIES.

09:07.111 --> 09:08.591
WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

09:08.635 --> 09:11.159
IT MEANS THERE IS
A WHOLE WORLD

09:11.202 --> 09:14.510
OUTSIDE THE ISLAND THAT
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT--

09:14.554 --> 09:17.295
BOOKS, FOOD, ELECTRICITY--

09:17.339 --> 09:19.384
AND SAFIYAH LIKES TO
KEEP IT THAT WAY

09:19.428 --> 09:23.606
SO THAT YOU STAY CLOSE
AND LOYAL AND UNINSPIRED.

09:27.305 --> 09:29.307
UNH!

09:36.750 --> 09:38.447
AS THE WEEKS PASSED,

09:38.490 --> 09:41.624
YOU TWO BECAME
EACH OTHER'S SPARRING PARTNERS.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.162
I THINK SAFIYAH
WILL LIKE YOU.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.296
THIS IS A WASTE
OF TIME.

10:01.339 --> 10:02.776
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
TRYING.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.953
YOU'RE WASTING
YOUR OWN TIME.

10:05.996 --> 10:07.432
WELL, IF IT'S ALL
THE SAME TO YOU,

10:07.476 --> 10:09.086
I'D RATHER WASTE MY TIME
AND GO GET DRUNK.

10:09.130 --> 10:10.610
WHAT DO YOU REALLY WANT?

10:10.653 --> 10:13.438
REVENGE? WHY?

10:13.482 --> 10:15.832
BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY
MOVED ON AFTER MORE
THAN A DECADE?

10:15.876 --> 10:18.443
CATHERINE HAMILTON LIED
THROUGH HER TEETH

10:18.487 --> 10:20.054
SO THEY WOULD
FORGET ME.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.664
OR MAYBE SHE DID THEM
A FAVOR.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.448
YOU SAID THEY LOOKED
FOR A YEAR.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.102
YOU WEREN'T GONNA BE FOUND.
WHAT WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO,

10:25.146 --> 10:26.930
SIT AROUND AND BE MISERABLE
FOR THE NEXT DECADE?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.671
IS THAT REALLY
WHAT YOU WANTED,

10:28.715 --> 10:32.196
THE FAMILY YOU
SUPPOSEDLY LOVE
AND MISS SO MUCH?

10:32.240 --> 10:34.808
YOU DON'T NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO FIGHT, ALICE.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.636
YOU NEED TO LEARN
HOW TO FEEL.

10:53.870 --> 10:56.525
BABY...

10:56.568 --> 10:59.441
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
BE GOING WHERE YOU'RE GOING?

11:01.399 --> 11:02.836
YOU KNOW
I HAVE FAITH

11:02.879 --> 11:04.315
IN YOUR
DECISION-MAKING.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.143
ALL I'M CAUTIONING
IS BE MINDFUL

11:06.187 --> 11:07.667
THE COMPANY YOU KEEP.

11:07.710 --> 11:10.060
OTHER PEOPLE JUDGE
YOUR FRIENDS.

11:10.104 --> 11:13.150
MAMA...ANGELIQUE IS
A GOOD PERSON.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.978
MM-HMM. SHE ALSO
GETS IN TROUBLE,

11:15.022 --> 11:18.460
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
GETTING ROPED
INTO HER DRAMA.

11:18.503 --> 11:20.114
YOU WERE PUT
ON THIS EARTH

11:20.157 --> 11:21.811
FOR BIGGER AND BETTER
THINGS, CHILD.

11:21.855 --> 11:26.555
I KNOW. YOU TELL ME
THIS EVERY DAY. HA!

11:32.169 --> 11:33.910
MAMA?

11:33.954 --> 11:36.565
WHAT THE?

11:36.608 --> 11:38.219
WHAT HAPPENED?

11:38.262 --> 11:39.786
WHY'D YOU STOP?

11:42.789 --> 11:44.878
MAMA.

11:44.921 --> 11:47.924
MAMA, WHAT HAPPENED?

11:50.100 --> 11:53.756
BATWOMAN,
DO YOU COPY? BATWOMAN!

11:53.800 --> 11:55.279
SHE JUST HIT
92 MILES PER HOUR,

11:55.323 --> 11:56.628
AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER COMMS.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.934
WHERE THE HELL
IS SHE GOING?

11:57.978 --> 11:59.196
SHE'S HEADED
TOWARDS THE WEST END.

11:59.240 --> 12:00.415
WHAT THE HELL'S UP THERE?

12:00.458 --> 12:01.764
-OH, NO.
-WHAT?

12:01.808 --> 12:02.939
OF COURSE THAT'S
WHERE SHE WENT.

12:02.983 --> 12:04.375
WHERE? WHERE'S SHE GOING?

12:04.419 --> 12:06.290
HER BRAIN ISN'T
WORKING,

12:06.334 --> 12:08.728
-SO SHE TURNED TO HER HEART.
-WHAT?

12:10.817 --> 12:12.209
OH, MY GOD!

12:15.343 --> 12:17.345
WHAT HE ACTUAL HELL?

12:17.388 --> 12:19.216
ANGIE. ANGELIQUE.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.784
HOW DO YOU KNOW
MY NAME?

12:21.828 --> 12:24.047
AND ARE--ARE YOU OK?

12:24.091 --> 12:25.483
I...

12:25.527 --> 12:28.356
HEY. WHERE'S
YOUR WINE OPENER?

12:28.399 --> 12:29.836
OH, MY GOD!

12:29.879 --> 12:31.272
-SHE DOESN'T DRINK.
-I DON'T DRINK.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.364
I'M SORRY. HOW DO YOU
KNOW MY LIFE?

12:36.407 --> 12:38.061
ANGIE, WHAT IS
GOING ON?

12:38.105 --> 12:40.368
ANGIE.
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OUT,

12:40.411 --> 12:42.500
LIKE, FIGHTING CRIME?

12:44.241 --> 12:46.722
I'M LOOKING
FOR YOUR FRIEND--

12:46.766 --> 12:49.943
OCEAN.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.727
CAN I HAVE TWO SECONDS?

12:51.771 --> 12:53.642
OK.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.818
AHEM. SORRY.

12:55.862 --> 12:58.603
NO IDEA, UH, WHO YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

12:58.647 --> 13:02.129
MAYBE YOU KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

13:02.172 --> 13:06.829
WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO, SLASH ME?

13:06.873 --> 13:10.137
LOOK. THE DUDE GROWS SHROOMS
IN A CONCRETE JUNGLE.

13:10.180 --> 13:13.314
IF YOU CAN'T FIND HIM,
MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T QUIT
YOUR DAY JOB.

13:13.357 --> 13:17.187
OR I'LL HAUL YOUR ASS
INTO THE COPS,

13:17.231 --> 13:19.624
AND I'LL LET THEM
SWEAT IT OUT OF YOU.

13:19.668 --> 13:22.192
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
YOU GOT ME.

13:22.236 --> 13:25.108
YOU'LL FIND HIM
IN COVENTRY.

13:25.152 --> 13:27.197
I'LL GIVE YOU
A HEAD START.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.590
AAH!

13:50.830 --> 13:52.875
GRAB HER LEGS.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.398
-MAN,
-THIS IS
THE GOTHAM CITY
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.357
STOP AND BACK AWAY
FROM THE SUSPECT.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.359
I REPEAT.
BACK AWAY FROM THE SUSPECT.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.622
YOU ARE INTERFERING
IN A POLICE RESPONSE.

14:00.665 --> 14:04.060
FREEZE. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
AND ORDERED NOT TO MOVE.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.062
REPEAT. YOU ARE UNDER ARREST...

14:06.106 --> 14:07.934
I'LL MEET YOU
IN THE BATCAVE.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.892
-WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME THE KEYS?
-I HAVE TO TAKE THE BATMOBILE.

14:09.936 --> 14:11.763
-I CAN TAKE THE BATMOBILE.
-YOU'VE NEVER DRIVEN IT BEFORE.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.113
-I'VE NEVER DRIVEN
YOUR CAR BEFORE.
-MARY, NO!

14:13.156 --> 14:14.288
-YES!
-NO!

14:14.331 --> 14:15.767
-YES!
-MARY!

14:15.811 --> 14:17.508
YES!
RELEASE THE SUSPECT.

14:17.552 --> 14:20.598
-WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
-GIVE ME, GIVE ME!

14:20.642 --> 14:22.818
YOU ARE UNDER ARREST
AND ORDERED...

14:22.862 --> 14:24.298
HELL, YEAH!

14:38.616 --> 14:40.183
MAMA?

14:44.405 --> 14:45.623
MAMA!

15:08.690 --> 15:10.083
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.999
WHY DID YOU DO THIS
TO US?

15:13.042 --> 15:15.044
YOU MUST BE MAD,

15:15.088 --> 15:16.698
OR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE.

15:24.445 --> 15:29.145
WHY DID YOU KILL HER?
WHAT WAS THE POINT?

15:29.189 --> 15:30.581
HUH!

15:41.941 --> 15:44.856
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH PAIN
YOU CAUSED ME?

15:44.900 --> 15:46.989
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

15:47.033 --> 15:48.643
HOW DO YOU JUST MURDER
SOMEONE'S MOM

15:48.686 --> 15:50.993
AND MOVE ON LIKE
IT DOESN'T MATTER?

15:51.037 --> 15:53.343
HA HA HA!

15:53.387 --> 15:55.867
HUH!

15:59.523 --> 16:03.266
TELL ME YOU REMEMBER HER!
TELL ME HER NAME!

16:03.310 --> 16:09.620
CORA. CORA LEWIS.

16:09.664 --> 16:12.319
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:12.362 --> 16:13.842
I'M GETTING THE JUSTICE...

16:13.885 --> 16:15.148
AAH!

16:15.191 --> 16:17.106
MY MOTHER DESERVES.

16:19.369 --> 16:20.675
AAH!

16:22.198 --> 16:23.895
AAH!

16:31.338 --> 16:35.081
OK. OK. SO I HID
THE BATMOBILE KEYS IN DINO,

16:35.124 --> 16:36.996
AND I'M PUTTING
AN EXTRA TRACKER

16:37.039 --> 16:38.693
IN HER GAUNTLET CUFFS
IN CASE SHE DECIDES TO
RUN OFF AGAIN

16:38.736 --> 16:40.303
AND THINKS TO TURN OFF
HER GPS.

16:40.347 --> 16:42.001
-WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
-I'M MIXING TWO

16:42.044 --> 16:44.003
COMPLEMENTARY CARDIOTONICS

16:44.046 --> 16:46.005
TO CALM DOWN HER MIND
AND SPEED UP HER SYSTEM

16:46.048 --> 16:48.529
AND HOPEFULLY PULL
HER OUT OF THESE
HALLUCINATIONS,

16:48.572 --> 16:52.576
BUT...THIS ISN'T
GONNA LAST,

16:52.620 --> 16:55.057
AND SINCE I DON'T HAVE
ACCESS TO MY CLINIC
ANYMORE,

16:55.101 --> 16:58.365
I'M GONNA NEED
A FEW SUPPLIES.

16:58.408 --> 17:01.150
OK. GREAT. DO I LOOK
LIKE POSTMATES, OR--

17:01.194 --> 17:03.196
NO, NOR DO YOU
LOOK LIKE A DOCTOR,

17:03.239 --> 17:04.893
WHICH IS WHO NEEDS
TO STAY WITH HER
RIGHT NOW,

17:04.936 --> 17:06.895
UNLESS YOU WANT TO
GIVE IT A SHOT,

17:06.938 --> 17:08.679
YOU KNOW, PUT HER LIFE
IN YOUR HANDS JUST
FOR FUNSIES?

17:08.723 --> 17:10.420
OK. I'LL BE BACK.

17:16.905 --> 17:19.821
HMM?

17:19.864 --> 17:21.388
AH, AH, AH.

17:24.347 --> 17:25.914
SAVE SOME
FOR THE FISHIES.

17:25.957 --> 17:30.005
SO SAFIYAH AND I
SHARED A COMMON ENEMY,

17:30.049 --> 17:32.616
SHE THOUGHT I'D BE
A GOOD SOLDIER,

17:32.660 --> 17:36.359
AND I STARTED TO HATE-CRUSH
HER METAPHORICAL BROTHER.

17:36.403 --> 17:40.189
CALL ME OLD-FASHIONED,
BUT I'M MISSING THE MOTIVE
FOR A LOBOTOMY.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.844
YOU'RE REALLY NOT
GETTING IT, ARE YOU?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.759
WELL, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY
UNFOLDING THE PLOT

17:44.802 --> 17:46.674
TO A SHAKESPEARIAN
DRAMA HERE.

17:46.717 --> 17:50.286
SAFIYAH WOULD CLAIM
SHE WANTED YOU
FOR HER ARMY,

17:50.330 --> 17:52.506
SURVIVAL INSTINCTS
WOULD MAKE YOU

17:52.549 --> 17:55.335
AN EXCELLENT FIGHTER
AND ADVISOR.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.686
AND WHAT WOULD YOU
CLAIM?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.688
THAT SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH YOU.

18:06.998 --> 18:09.349
I HEARD THERE WAS WINE.

18:09.392 --> 18:10.915
SOUNDS LIKE TRAINING'S
GOING WELL.

18:10.959 --> 18:12.134
I HAVE YET TO SEE
THE POINT OF AN ARMY.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.527
YOU HAVE NO CRIME HERE,

18:13.570 --> 18:14.876
EVERYONE WALKS AROUND
WITH A SMILE.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.747
I'M IN ROMAN PLEASANTVILLE.

18:16.791 --> 18:19.924
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY
I INVITED YOU HERE,

18:19.968 --> 18:24.538
TO TELL YOU
ABOUT THE DESERT ROSE.

18:24.581 --> 18:26.801
IT'S DELICATE AND VIBRANT

18:26.844 --> 18:30.544
AND IN THE WRONG HANDS
ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS
WEAPONS IN THE WORLD.

18:30.587 --> 18:32.154
THIS?

18:32.198 --> 18:35.418
ITS SERUM CAN CURE ILLNESS,
HEREDITARY DISEASE.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.508
IT CAN EXPUNGE TOXINS,
PATHOGENS.

18:38.552 --> 18:42.686
THIS SIMPLE FLOWER
IS A MIRACLE CURE-ALL, ALICE,

18:42.730 --> 18:46.386
AND IT'S MY BIRTHRIGHT
TO PROTECT IT AT ALL COSTS.

18:46.429 --> 18:48.997
-HENCE THE ARMY.
-HENCE THE ARMY.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.653
ON OCCASION, WORD
OF A MYSTICAL FLOWER
ON A FARAWAY ISLAND

18:52.696 --> 18:54.916
DRAWS UNWANTED ATTENTION.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.180
IF OUTSIDERS WERE ABLE
TO COME TAKE IT,

18:58.224 --> 18:59.877
WE'D BE LEFT WITH NOTHING,

18:59.921 --> 19:01.749
AND OUR SANCTUARY
WOULD BE DESTROYED.

19:01.792 --> 19:03.403
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GROW MORE?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.579
ACCORDING TO THE LORE,
CENTURIES AGO,

19:05.622 --> 19:07.798
THE WOMEN OF A VILLAGE
IN EUROPE

19:07.842 --> 19:11.019
BANDED TOGETHER TO ESCAPE
THEIR ABUSIVE HUSBANDS.

19:11.062 --> 19:13.195
THEY'D HEARD TELL
OF AN ISLAND

19:13.239 --> 19:16.503
UNDER THE CONSTELLATIONS
OF CASSIOPEIA AND ANDROMEDA,

19:16.546 --> 19:19.897
AND THEY FLED HERE
WITH THEIR CHILDREN IN TOW.

19:19.941 --> 19:23.988
MONTHS LATER, THE MEN
THEY ESCAPED TRACKED THEM DOWN.

19:24.032 --> 19:27.166
AS THEIR SHIPS LANDED,
THE MEN WERE MET

19:27.209 --> 19:29.385
BY A FEROCIOUS
FEMALE ARMY.

19:29.429 --> 19:32.345
THE WOMEN SUCCEEDED
IN DRIVING THE MEN
BACK INTO THE SEA.

19:32.388 --> 19:35.043
HOWEVER, IT WAS
AT GREAT COST.

19:35.086 --> 19:38.394
MANY WOMEN LAY DEAD,
SLAUGHTERED.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.397
ONLY MY ANCESTORS
AND A FEW OTHERS SURVIVED.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.574
THE NEXT DAY, A FIELD
OF ROSES BLOOMED

19:44.618 --> 19:48.926
IN THE VERY SPOT
OF THE BATTLE.

19:48.970 --> 19:51.407
THE WOMEN CLAIMED
THE BLOOD THAT
HAD BEEN SPILLED

19:51.451 --> 19:53.235
WAS SACRED,

19:53.279 --> 19:56.934
ITS PROTECTIVE
FEMININE ESSENCE
ENRICHED THE LAND.

20:00.199 --> 20:04.464
THEY WROTE THAT ONLY
A WOMAN'S LIFE FORCE

20:04.507 --> 20:06.944
COULD BIRTH THIS MEDICINE

20:06.988 --> 20:09.904
DESTINED TO SAVE MANKIND.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.263
HEH HEH.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.873
SHE KNEW SHE
COULDN'T TELL YOU
HOW SHE FELT,

20:22.917 --> 20:24.266
SO SHE SHOWED YOU.

20:24.310 --> 20:25.702
SHE ENTRUSTED YOU

20:25.746 --> 20:28.792
WITH HER MOST
VALUED SECRET.

20:28.836 --> 20:32.231
AND SOMEONE WAS
A LITTLE JEALOUS?

20:32.274 --> 20:34.581
HA HA HA!

20:34.624 --> 20:37.758
YOU WEREN'T A THREAT
TO ME, ALICE.

20:37.801 --> 20:42.415
YOU WERE A THREAT
TO THE ENTIRE ISLAND
OF CORYANA.

20:42.458 --> 20:48.159
NOT EVEN, LIKE,
A TEENY, WEENY,
ITTY, BITTY BIT JEALOUS?

20:48.203 --> 20:50.423
I'M SAFIYAH'S
RIGHT HAND.

20:50.466 --> 20:51.989
IT'S MY JOB
TO TELL HER

20:52.033 --> 20:54.601
WHEN THERE'S A FOX
IN THE HENHOUSE.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.255
SO YOU THINK I'M A FOX?

20:56.298 --> 20:58.082
I THINK YOU'RE
A DISTRACTION.

20:58.126 --> 21:00.215
I THINK YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH HER.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.130
YOU ARE SUCH A CHILD.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.523
WELL, YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO CAN'T ADMIT YOU'RE
IN LOVE WITH HER.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.872
OF COURSE, I'M
IN LOVE WITH HER.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.352
HA HA HA!

21:06.395 --> 21:07.962
AND YOU'D BETTER BELIEVE

21:08.005 --> 21:09.616
THAT WHEN THE FIRST
OPPORTUNITY AROSE

21:09.659 --> 21:14.795
FOR ME TO DESTROY YOU
I DID NOT HESITATE.

21:20.104 --> 21:21.280
LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

21:26.676 --> 21:29.375
GOT TO WONDER
IF CATHERINE EVER
WANDERED THESE HALLS.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.202
GUESS THERE'S A LOT
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT HER.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.379
WELL, APPARENTLY,
IT RUNS IN THE FAMILY.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.381
TURNS OUT MARY WAS
OPERATING AN ILLEGAL
MEDICAL CLINIC

21:35.424 --> 21:37.470
OUT OF
A CHURCH BASEMENT.

21:37.513 --> 21:40.255
REALLY? THAT'S--HUH.

21:40.299 --> 21:43.171
DID YOU KNOW?

21:43.214 --> 21:45.347
-SIR...
-YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

21:45.391 --> 21:47.349
NO ONE WANTS TO TELL
ME ANYTHING AROUND HERE.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.830
BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D
SHUT IT DOWN.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.135
THAT PLACE WAS HER LIFE.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.007
SHE HELPED A LOT
OF PEOPLE.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.661
HAVE YOU TWO
SPOKEN SINCE?

21:54.704 --> 21:56.445
I REFUSE TO LET HER
TURN INTO HER MOTHER.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.969
CATHERINE CUT A LOT
OF CORNERS AT HAMILTON.

21:59.013 --> 22:01.581
LOOK WHERE IT GOT US.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.322
I'LL TAKE THAT
AS A NO.

22:05.846 --> 22:09.806
WOMAN,
SYNTHETIC GRANULOCYTES.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.460
MY GOD.

22:11.504 --> 22:13.288
NOW INJECTING THEM
IN PATIENT B,

22:13.332 --> 22:17.336
AN 80-YEAR-OLD MALE
WITH A SIMILAR CANCER.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.990
OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT
THE NEW SOLUTION

22:20.034 --> 22:21.470
DR. ROGERS!

22:21.514 --> 22:23.342
SO MUCH FOR OUR LEAD.

22:25.996 --> 22:28.303
SO WE'LL
CHECK BACK IN 24 HOURS

22:28.347 --> 22:30.305
AND LOOK FOR PROGRESS.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.486
HELP!
UH, JUST CALM DOWN, BREATHE.

22:37.530 --> 22:39.923
WE NEED HELP IN HERE!

22:39.967 --> 22:42.056
TRY TO BREATHE.

22:51.108 --> 22:53.067
WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
DEALING WITH?

23:00.117 --> 23:03.251
RYAN, CAN YOU HEAR ME?

23:05.514 --> 23:07.342
THIS KRYPTONITE GIVES
A WORSE HANGOVER

23:07.386 --> 23:11.041
THAN $2.00 TEQUILA.

23:11.085 --> 23:14.480
WAIT. HOW DID I GET
BACK HERE?

23:14.523 --> 23:18.048
LUKE AND I FOUND YOU
OUTSIDE OF ANGELIQUE'S. YEAH.

23:18.092 --> 23:22.357
BUT GOOD NEWS--I GOT TO
DRIVE THE BATMOBILE.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.533
BAD NEWS--THE WIPERS BUTTON
AND THE ROCKET LAUNCHERS

23:24.577 --> 23:26.535
LOOK VERY SIMILAR.

23:26.579 --> 23:28.145
SOMEONE SHOULD
LABEL THOSE.

23:28.189 --> 23:29.625
WHAT DID YOU DO?

23:29.669 --> 23:31.540
I SHOULD BE ASKING YOU
THAT, MISSY.

23:31.584 --> 23:33.673
WHY'D YOU GO TO ANGELIQUE'S
IN THE BATSUIT?

23:33.716 --> 23:35.979
I NEEDED A LEAD
ON OCEAN.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.025
YOU'RE DYING,
AND YOU WASTE

23:38.068 --> 23:39.809
YOUR LAST GASPS
OF ENERGY ON HIM?

23:39.853 --> 23:42.551
NO. I FIND OCEAN,
I FIND ALICE

23:42.595 --> 23:44.553
SO I CAN HEAR
HER LAST GASP.

23:44.597 --> 23:47.164
-RYAN.
-NO. I AM NOT GOING DOWN

23:47.208 --> 23:49.471
WITHOUT GETTING JUSTICE
FOR BOTH OF OUR MOMS.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.908
LET'S JUST GET SOME
MORE FLUIDS IN YOU FIRST,

23:51.952 --> 23:55.608
AND THEN WE CAN TALK...
BUCKET LIST.

24:04.225 --> 24:05.879
THIS IS ROGERS' OFFICE.

24:05.922 --> 24:07.446
WE LOOKED
INTO THE DECEASED,

24:07.489 --> 24:08.925
AND EVERYONE SEEMS
TO HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

24:08.969 --> 24:10.666
IN THE EXPERIMENTS
WITH THE DESERT ROSE.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.669
MY GUESS IS THEY WERE TRYING
TO CREATE MORE AND FAILED.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.283
CORYANA SENT THEIR
ASSASSINS TO COVER
THEIR TRACKS.

24:19.327 --> 24:22.504
I BELIEVE SAFIYAH CALLS THEM
THE MANY ARMS OF DEATH.

24:22.548 --> 24:25.551
LET'S JUST HOPE THEY
DIDN'T FIND THE MAP
THAT ROGERS STOLE.

24:25.594 --> 24:27.422
IT HAS TO BE AROUND HERE
SOMEWHERE.

24:30.207 --> 24:31.470
HANG ON.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.779
BINGO.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.975
THEY BEAT US TO IT.

24:59.019 --> 25:02.065
AGH! AGH!

25:05.504 --> 25:07.288
SIR.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.333
THEY HAVE MY KATE,
DAMN IT.

25:12.554 --> 25:15.557
I CAN'T STAND LOSING
ANOTHER DAUGHTER
LIKE THIS.

25:43.498 --> 25:45.152
WHEN I WAS BEING HELD
IN THAT CELL,

25:45.195 --> 25:49.939
MY FATHER AND SISTER
CAME LOOKING FOR ME.

25:49.983 --> 25:55.597
I WAS TOLD IF I MADE A SOUND
THEY'D BE SHOT,

25:55.641 --> 25:59.383
BUT KATE, MY, UM--
MY TWIN,

25:59.427 --> 26:02.561
SHE FOUND MY CELL,

26:02.604 --> 26:05.781
AND I HEARD HER
PUT HER HAND ON THE DOOR,

26:05.825 --> 26:08.958
SO I DID THE SAME,

26:09.002 --> 26:15.791
AND I JUST STOOD THERE
SILENTLY...PRAYING

26:15.835 --> 26:17.532
THAT SHE WOULD...

26:19.578 --> 26:21.754
FEEL ME.

26:21.797 --> 26:23.320
AND SHE NEVER DID?

26:25.975 --> 26:29.500
YOU ASKED
WHY I WANT REVENGE.

26:29.544 --> 26:32.591
IT'S BECAUSE I CAN'T
FORGET MOMENTS LIKE THAT.

26:35.942 --> 26:38.161
THEN DON'T,

26:38.205 --> 26:40.207
BUT DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO SPEND

26:40.250 --> 26:42.644
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
TRYING TO GET HER
TO APOLOGIZE?

26:42.688 --> 26:45.778
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
HOW THIS WORKS.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.257
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

26:47.301 --> 26:48.650
SHE WILL SPEND
EVERY WAKING MOMENT

26:48.694 --> 26:52.611
TRYING TO FIX IT,
TO FIX YOU,

26:52.654 --> 26:54.003
AND SHE CAN'T.

26:54.047 --> 26:57.180
ONLY YOU CAN DO THAT.

26:57.224 --> 26:59.792
YOU GOT OUT, YOU GOT
YOUR SECOND CHANCE.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.881
LET IT GO.

27:01.924 --> 27:03.796
BE HAPPY.

27:03.839 --> 27:06.494
YOU MAKE THAT SOUND
SO...

27:06.537 --> 27:07.756
SO EASY.

27:07.800 --> 27:10.541
IT IS.

27:10.585 --> 27:13.544
AT LEAST IT IS NOW.

27:13.588 --> 27:14.937
DESERT ROSE SNIPS.

27:14.981 --> 27:17.766
I'LL PLANT THEM,
NURTURE THEM,

27:17.810 --> 27:19.725
FEED THEM BLOOD
SO THEY BLOOM.

27:19.768 --> 27:22.553
PRETTY SOON, ALL
OF MANKIND WILL HAVE
ITS MIRACLE DRUG,

27:22.597 --> 27:24.251
AND I'LL HAVE MONEY
TO TRAVEL THE WORLD.

27:24.294 --> 27:26.383
YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAVE THOSE.

27:26.427 --> 27:29.125
THERE'S A LOT SAFIYAH
TELLS US WE CAN'T HAVE.

27:38.004 --> 27:41.050
I WANT TO DO
WHAT YOU DID.

27:41.094 --> 27:43.183
I WANT TO ESCAPE,
I WANT TO START OVER

27:43.226 --> 27:45.620
AND EXPERIENCE LIFE
OUTSIDE THIS ISLAND.

27:54.629 --> 27:57.501
AND I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.197
-TATIANA,
-THE MAN
YOU WERE WILLING

28:41.241 --> 28:43.069
TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOR,

28:43.112 --> 28:45.898
THE ONE PERSON WHO
OFFERED YOU A SECOND CHANCE

28:45.941 --> 28:48.291
AND FREEDOM
FROM YOUR PAST

28:48.335 --> 28:53.470
IS THE SAME MAN SAFIYAH
CONVINCED YOU TO STAB

28:53.514 --> 28:56.952
THROUGH THE HEART.

28:56.996 --> 29:01.870
HA HA HA!

29:01.914 --> 29:03.437
I'M SORRY. THAT'S IT?

29:03.480 --> 29:05.047
THAT'S YOUR BIG
MIC DROP MOMENT?

29:05.091 --> 29:06.788
"SURPRISE! YOU KILLED
YOUR SOUL MATE

29:06.832 --> 29:08.659
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER."

29:08.703 --> 29:11.575
YEAH. I FOUND
MY MOTHER'S HEAD
IN A FREEZER,

29:11.619 --> 29:13.229
SO IF YOU'RE TRYING
TO SHOCK ME,

29:13.273 --> 29:16.276
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
DO A LITTLE BETTER
THAN THAT.

29:33.032 --> 29:36.557
DON'T YOU THINK YOU
SHOULD BE LYING DOWN?

29:36.600 --> 29:39.125
ANGELIQUE SAID
HE GREW SHROOMS

29:39.168 --> 29:41.040
IN A CONCRETE JUNGLE,
MEANING HE WOULD NEED

29:41.083 --> 29:42.955
SOME TYPE
OF INDOOR FOREST.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.087
THAT MEANS A NEIGHBORHOOD
WITH A HIGH MOISTURE LEVEL.

29:45.131 --> 29:47.002
-NORTH SIDE BY THE WATER.
-WAIT. WHAT?

29:47.046 --> 29:48.961
HE'D HAVE TO BLOCK OUT
HIS WINDOWS,

29:49.004 --> 29:50.614
WOULDN'T WANT
QUESTIONS ASKED,

29:50.658 --> 29:52.051
AND HE'D HAVE TO DRAW
A CRAPLOAD OF POWER

29:52.094 --> 29:53.748
FOR ALL THOSE
GROW LAMPS.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.447
OH! THE GROW LAMPS.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.101
RYAN, YOU NEED TO
LIE DOWN.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.755
I NEED TO FIND ALICE.

30:00.799 --> 30:04.454
NO. I--I CAN'T LET YOU
KILL ALICE.

30:04.498 --> 30:06.674
DO YOU LOVE
YOUR MOM?

30:06.717 --> 30:08.154
OF COURSE I DO.

30:08.197 --> 30:09.938
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN WHAT WE DO HERE?

30:09.982 --> 30:11.592
YOU KNOW I DO.

30:11.635 --> 30:14.290
THEN HOW CAN WE STAND
BEHIND THIS SYMBOL

30:14.334 --> 30:16.553
AND CLAIM WE FIGHT
FOR JUSTICE

30:16.597 --> 30:18.207
AND WE STAND UP
FOR VICTIMS

30:18.251 --> 30:20.427
AND WE PROTECT
OUR STREETS

30:20.470 --> 30:24.692
WITH A LEGITIMATE
SERIAL-KILLING
PSYCHOPATH OUT THERE,

30:24.735 --> 30:26.781
LIVING, BREATHING,

30:26.825 --> 30:28.914
LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO FIND YOUR SISTER
AND KILL HER, TOO?

30:28.957 --> 30:30.741
-AND WE WILL STOP HER!
-WHEN?

30:30.785 --> 30:33.309
WHEN TWO CROWS BRING
ME SOME MIRACLE FLOWER

30:33.353 --> 30:35.746
FROM AN ISLAND
WE CAN'T GET TO?

30:35.790 --> 30:38.053
-THAT'S WHAT I WAS--
-DID THEY FIND THE MAP?

30:38.097 --> 30:40.664
DID THEY FIND THE MAP?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.362
THE MAP'S GONE.

30:45.713 --> 30:49.760
ALICE TOOK OUR MOMS
FROM US, MARY.

30:51.066 --> 30:53.416
DO YOU EVER
FOR A SECOND THINK

30:53.460 --> 30:55.027
ABOUT WHAT YOUR LIFE
WOULD BE LIKE

30:55.070 --> 30:56.593
IF SHE WERE
STILL HERE?

30:59.074 --> 31:01.772
IF SHE COULD BE
PROUD OF YOU
FOR ONE MORE DAY,

31:01.816 --> 31:03.600
IF YOU COULD ASK HER
FOR ADVICE

31:03.644 --> 31:05.559
OR TELL HER
ABOUT A CRUSH

31:05.602 --> 31:08.301
OR HEAR HER TELL YOU
SHE LOVES YOU?

31:08.344 --> 31:10.346
A MILLION TIMES A DAY.

31:10.390 --> 31:13.349
I AM AS GOOD AS DEAD,
MARY,

31:13.393 --> 31:14.916
AND I AM NOT
LEAVING HERE

31:14.960 --> 31:17.266
WITHOUT GETTING
JUSTICE,

31:17.310 --> 31:21.096
SO...YOU CAN STEP
OUT OF MY WAY

31:21.140 --> 31:22.576
AND LET ME DO
MY THING,

31:22.619 --> 31:24.665
OR I CAN GO
THROUGH YOU.

31:28.495 --> 31:29.975
KEYS ARE IN DINO.

31:50.952 --> 31:52.562
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

31:52.606 --> 31:54.477
PACKING UP. WE'RE DONE.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.959
YOU DON'T WANT TO
KNOW MORE?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.700
WHAT'S TO KNOW?

31:59.743 --> 32:01.267
SAFIYAH GOT JEALOUS,
SO SHE TOOK AWAY

32:01.310 --> 32:03.834
MY MEMORY OF OCEAN
TO PUNISH ME.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.140
I COULD HAVE SAVED
A LOT OF TIME

32:05.184 --> 32:06.968
BY READING THE BACK
OF THE BOOK.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.666
IT WASN'T AS SIMPLE
AS PLUCKING OUT
JUST THOSE MEMORIES.

32:09.710 --> 32:11.320
THERE WAS
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

32:13.540 --> 32:14.976
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D SEE THE DAY

32:15.020 --> 32:17.587
THAT A MAN I CONSIDERED
A BROTHER

32:17.631 --> 32:19.763
WOULD BE KNEELING BEFORE ME
A BETRAYER OF HIS ISLAND

32:19.807 --> 32:21.548
AND HIS PEOPLE!

32:21.591 --> 32:25.465
THAT FLOWER IS
EVERYTHING TO US,

32:25.508 --> 32:26.988
THAT WHICH DEFINES US,

32:27.032 --> 32:28.772
THAT WHICH IS THE KEY
TO OUR SURVIVAL!

32:28.816 --> 32:31.036
SAFIYAH, WE BOTH KNOW
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
A STUPID FLOWER.

32:31.079 --> 32:32.863
AND WHAT DO YOU
THINK IT'S ABOUT?

32:32.907 --> 32:35.388
ME HAVING THE ONE THING
YOU CAN'T.

32:37.651 --> 32:40.349
ALICE IS A SNAKE

32:40.393 --> 32:44.005
THAT SLITHERED
INTO OUR GARDEN.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.529
LET ME KILL HER.

32:46.573 --> 32:49.576
WE'RE NOT KILLING ANYONE.

32:49.619 --> 32:52.013
I'M GOING TO VISIT
A PUNISHMENT UPON HER

32:52.057 --> 32:54.320
THAT FITS THE CRIME.

32:54.363 --> 32:57.845
FIND ENIGMA,
BRING HER TO ME.

32:57.888 --> 33:01.805
SAFIYAH, NO.
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

33:01.849 --> 33:04.069
YES, MY QUEEN.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.940
YOU WANTED TO TAKE
THE ONE THING THAT WAS

33:05.984 --> 33:07.550
PRECIOUS TO ME.

33:07.594 --> 33:10.118
I WILL TAKE WHAT'S
MOST PRECIOUS TO YOU--

33:10.162 --> 33:11.641
EACH OTHER!

33:11.685 --> 33:14.035
-WHO'S ENIGMA?
-A HYPNOTIST.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.950
SHE WANTS TO SCREW
WITH OUR HEADS.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.518
YOU'RE NOT A SNAKE, ALICE.

33:18.561 --> 33:20.041
YOU'RE JUST
A BROKEN LITTLE GIRL,

33:20.085 --> 33:21.738
WHO SOUGHT REFUGE
FROM HER TRAUMA

33:21.782 --> 33:25.177
BY ESCAPING
INTO A FANTASTICAL BOOK!

33:25.220 --> 33:28.484
I KNOW THE BIG, WILD WORLD
SEEMED DAUNTING TO YOU.

33:28.528 --> 33:30.008
I WAS GOING TO SHOW YOU
HOW EASILY

33:30.051 --> 33:32.532
YOU COULD RISE AND THRIVE,

33:32.575 --> 33:35.665
BUT INSTEAD, YOU TURNED
TO HIM FOR SOLACE
AND REHABILITATION.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.667
SHE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG!

33:39.278 --> 33:42.194
YOU ARE GOING TO
GO HOME, ALICE!

33:42.237 --> 33:45.806
YOU ARE GOING TO EMBRACE
THIS FAIRYTALE PERSONA OF YOURS,

33:45.849 --> 33:49.636
AND YOU'RE GOING TO IMBUE IT
WITH FURY!

33:49.679 --> 33:52.291
YOU WILL BUILD
YOUR OWN ARMY,

33:52.334 --> 33:55.163
YOU WILL BECOME YOUR OWN QUEEN,

33:55.207 --> 33:57.687
AND YOU WILL CARRY OUT
THE VENGEANCE ON YOUR FAMILY

33:57.731 --> 34:01.300
THAT YOU
SO DESPERATELY CRAVE,

34:01.343 --> 34:04.172
AND YOU'LL FORGET
ALL ABOUT OCEAN

34:04.216 --> 34:06.392
AND YOUR LOVE
FOR EACH OTHER!

34:08.133 --> 34:10.309
DON'T DO THIS,
SAFIYAH.

34:10.352 --> 34:12.398
TATIANA,
WITH THE MEMORIES CAME

34:12.441 --> 34:16.010
THE LOVE AND HUMANITY
THAT WAS BUBBLING UP
INSIDE OF YOU.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.840
SAFIYAH TOOK THAT
AND IN TURN

34:19.883 --> 34:22.234
ACTIVATED THIS...

34:22.277 --> 34:25.628
COLD, HARD,

34:25.672 --> 34:28.414
VENGEANCE-OBSESSED
KILLING MACHINE.

34:28.457 --> 34:30.546
YOU WOULD HAVE
RUN AWAY WITH OCEAN

34:30.590 --> 34:32.461
AND STARTED
A NEW LIFE,

34:32.505 --> 34:35.377
HAPPY, FREE, IN LOVE.

34:35.421 --> 34:39.990
INSTEAD, SAFIYAH
TURNED YOU INTO HERSELF.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.862
YOU LOOK UPSET.

34:41.905 --> 34:43.733
SHAKESPEARIAN ENOUGH
FOR YOU?

34:52.438 --> 34:55.615
TAKE THE BODY.

34:55.658 --> 34:58.748
I'LL CALL YOU
FOR MY PICKUP.

34:58.792 --> 35:00.533
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

35:00.576 --> 35:02.665
OH, I'M NOT REQUESTING
AN AUDIENCE WITH THE QUEEN

35:02.709 --> 35:04.363
DRESSED LIKE THIS.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.332
GOTCHA.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.073
-ENIGMA DID THIS?
-MM-HMM.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.683
OF COURSE.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.207
SHE'S A HYPNOTIST.

35:22.250 --> 35:23.817
OWED SAFIYAH
A FAVOR.

35:23.860 --> 35:27.647
SAFIYAH AND HER LEGION
OF LADY LOYALISTS.

35:27.690 --> 35:30.302
TATIANA FOUND OUT
YOU WERE STEALING
THE DESERT ROSE.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.695
GOOD RIDDANCE.
THAT FLOWER'S MEANT
TO SAVE LIVES,

35:32.739 --> 35:35.916
YET IT DESTROYS
EVERYTHING IT TOUCHES.

35:39.833 --> 35:45.230
AND...I GUESS
THIS IS IT.

35:46.753 --> 35:48.972
THERE'S A BAR
IN PORTOFINO

35:49.016 --> 35:50.539
I'VE ALWAYS
WANTED TO TRY.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.281
COBBLESTONE STREETS,
VIEW OF THE HARBOR.

35:57.242 --> 36:01.115
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
WHAT NOW?

36:01.159 --> 36:03.204
UH...NOW I'M OFF
TO CORYANA

36:03.248 --> 36:06.164
TO GET MY FINAL REVENGE
ON MY SISTER.

36:08.209 --> 36:13.910
UNLESS...YOU HAVE
A REASON TO STOP ME.

36:20.743 --> 36:22.310
LIVE YOUR LIFE.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.706
SEE YOU, ALICE.

36:42.765 --> 36:44.245
WHERE'S RYAN?

36:44.289 --> 36:45.725
MY DAD COULDN'T FIND
THE MAP,

36:45.768 --> 36:47.248
SO THERE'S NO WAY
TO FIND CORYANA.

36:47.292 --> 36:48.815
WHY ARE HER COMMS OFF?
WHERE IS SHE?

36:48.858 --> 36:50.643
-SHE'S GONNA DIE.
-MARY, WHERE IS RYAN?

36:52.427 --> 36:55.648
ALICE, DO YOU KNOW
WHO I AM?

36:55.691 --> 36:57.954
OK. I'VE HAD A DAY.

36:57.998 --> 37:02.785
CAN WE DO THIS
IN, SAY, 2...
3 WEEKS?

37:02.829 --> 37:05.788
DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?

37:05.832 --> 37:07.703
HONESTLY, SO MANY WOMEN
KEEP SHOWING UP

37:07.747 --> 37:09.792
IN THAT OUTFIT,
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO KEEP TRACK.

37:09.836 --> 37:11.403
HOW'S THIS?

37:16.756 --> 37:18.540
YOU KILLED MY MOM,

37:18.584 --> 37:20.934
AND NOW I'M HERE
TO KILL YOU.

37:20.977 --> 37:25.025
HEH. YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

37:25.068 --> 37:27.419
THAT'S WHAT THIS
IS ABOUT?

37:27.462 --> 37:29.725
MY MOM WAS CORA LEWIS.

37:29.769 --> 37:35.035
YOUR GANG BEAT HER TO DEATH
ON DECEMBER 13, 2015.

37:35.078 --> 37:37.255
I GET IT.
MOMMY DIED,

37:37.298 --> 37:40.040
AND NOW YOU'RE
A "WOMAN ON FIRE,"

37:40.083 --> 37:42.347
WHICH MEANS I'M
RESPONSIBLE FOR SPAWNING

37:42.390 --> 37:45.611
NOT ONE BATWOMAN...
BUT TWO.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.613
-YOU THINK THIS IS FUNNY?
-YES.

37:47.656 --> 37:50.137
MY MOM MEANT
EVERYTHING TO ME!

37:50.180 --> 37:53.096
I HAVE NO MEMORY
OF YOUR MOMMY.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.837
-LIAR!
-UNH!

37:54.881 --> 37:56.361
AAH!

37:58.841 --> 38:01.322
AW. DID YOU HURT
YOURSELF?

38:01.366 --> 38:03.106
IS THAT MY FAULT, TOO?

38:16.381 --> 38:18.644
UNH!

38:18.687 --> 38:20.341
AAH! OHH!

38:20.385 --> 38:21.342
UNH!

38:35.661 --> 38:37.315
AAH!

38:37.358 --> 38:38.707
HYAH!

38:40.970 --> 38:43.146
-RAAH!
-AAH!

38:46.106 --> 38:47.586
I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO KILLED HER.

38:47.629 --> 38:49.370
YOUR ARMY DID

38:49.414 --> 38:51.067
BECAUSE OF YOU
BECAUSE YOU TURNED THEM

38:51.111 --> 38:53.374
INTO COLDBLOODED KILLERS!

38:53.418 --> 38:55.289
-HA HA HA!
-AAH!

39:00.947 --> 39:02.340
AGH!

39:04.820 --> 39:06.256
RYAN!

39:06.300 --> 39:08.389
THIS ISN'T THE GIRL
I RAISED.

39:10.609 --> 39:14.090
BUT SHE KILLED YOU.

39:14.134 --> 39:15.570
AGH!

39:17.572 --> 39:18.921
UGH.

39:22.447 --> 39:25.580
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
MADE YOU THIS WAY,

39:25.624 --> 39:27.408
BUT YOU'RE NOT
WORTH IT.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.106
YOU'LL NEVER
BE WORTH IT!

39:32.979 --> 39:34.415
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

39:34.459 --> 39:36.548
EVERYTHING'S
YOUR FAULT.

39:36.591 --> 39:38.201
NOW LEAVE!

39:54.870 --> 39:56.829
NO SIGN OF ALICE
ANYWHERE, SIR.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.789
YOU KNOW, I FIGURED OUT
WHY CATHERINE LIED

40:00.833 --> 40:03.052
AND SAID THAT BETH
WAS DEAD.

40:04.489 --> 40:06.795
SHE WAS DOING ME A FAVOR.

40:08.318 --> 40:10.799
THE ONLY THING WORSE
THAN LOSING ONE
OF YOUR CHILDREN

40:10.843 --> 40:13.236
IS THE CYCLE
OF WAKING UP EVERY MORNING

40:13.280 --> 40:17.937
WITH HOPE AND THEN
HAVING IT RIPPED AWAY

40:17.980 --> 40:20.113
AND LOSING THEM ALL OVER
AGAIN BY DINNER.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.205
SIR, YOU REALLY
SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.208
I WON'T SLEEP UNTIL
I HAVE MY FAMILY BACK.

40:42.396 --> 40:44.267
THIS MUST BE
THE AIRPORT SHUTTLE.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.791
GET IN.

40:52.101 --> 40:55.148
AIR CORYANA TERMINAL,
JEEVSY.

41:03.069 --> 41:04.636
WHERE'S ALICE?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.292
HELLO TO YOU, TOO.

41:12.774 --> 41:14.776
WELL, I REALIZED KILLING
HER WOULD ONLY

41:14.820 --> 41:17.213
MAKE ME MORE LIKE HER.

41:17.257 --> 41:19.128
KIND OF WENT ALONG
WITH WHAT YOU GUYS WERE SAYING.

41:19.172 --> 41:20.608
GREAT.
SO WHERE IS SHE?

41:20.652 --> 41:22.392
-I LET HER GO.
-WHAT?! OK.

41:22.436 --> 41:25.221
THERE'S NOT KILLING,
BUT THERE'S STILL
APPREHENDING.

41:25.265 --> 41:27.572
WE NEED HER TO GO
TO CORYANA.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.183
NO, WE DON'T.
SHE'LL KILL KATE.

41:30.226 --> 41:32.098
I'LL STOP HER.

41:33.839 --> 41:36.537
I PUT A TRACKER
IN HER BOOT.

41:36.581 --> 41:39.888
WE FOLLOW HER,
WE FIND CORYANA,

41:39.932 --> 41:42.151
WE SAVE KATE.

41:42.195 --> 41:44.763
AND WE GET YOU
THE DESERT ROSE.

42:16.055 --> 42:17.883
GREG, MOVE YOUR HEAD!
