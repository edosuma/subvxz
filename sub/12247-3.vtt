released into the general population.

is the conjugal visits.

00:30.971 --> 00:32.171

She dies on my watch, she wins.

13:49.860 --> 13:51.066
Well, then I...

13:51.411 --> 13:52.905
I have a proposal...

13:54.117 --> 13:56.834
if you'd be willing to
guarantee my safety...

13:56.843 --> 13:58.840
Guarantee your safety?

13:59.419 --> 14:02.780
You obviously have influence. If
I can assure Miss Bennett that...

14:02.805 --> 14:05.398
I'm fine in here, with you, then
there'll be no need for that,

14:05.588 --> 14:07.205
and she can get rid of him.

14:07.819 --> 14:11.036
Well, isn't it your mandate
to protect vulnerable women?

14:11.061 --> 14:12.267
It is...

14:12.461 --> 14:15.546
but you're a screw, and worse
than that you were the governor.

14:16.358 --> 14:17.803
Paper covers rock.

14:18.550 --> 14:22.035
I will not put my girls
in danger to protect you.

14:27.655 --> 14:31.326
The readjustment process for
the women will take some time.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.428
The new programs are a great initiative,

14:33.453 --> 14:36.439
but just bear in mind, most
of them are institutionalised,

14:36.464 --> 14:39.905
so they're gonna have to become
accustomed to the new order.

14:39.931 --> 14:43.512
Ferguson being amongst them
is a reminder of the old days.

14:43.537 --> 14:45.656
But that is why I'm
keeping her under guard.

14:45.681 --> 14:49.363
Mmm. Have you any idea, as to her
agenda, now that she's in general?

14:49.901 --> 14:54.093
It may be to get revenge on
Smith or Will Jackson but...

14:55.014 --> 14:58.479
I suspect we won't know what
she's up to until it happens.

14:58.959 --> 15:02.173
Well, I still don't understand how
her doctor at the psych hospital

15:02.198 --> 15:04.609
could possibly have deemed her sane.

15:05.073 --> 15:07.084
<i>You've been progressing well, Joan.</i>

15:07.109 --> 15:10.319
<i>The medication's doing it's job.
I practice a therapy called...</i>

15:10.344 --> 15:12.685
<i>now it might be time to
tackle those root causes of...</i>

15:12.710 --> 15:15.326
<i>you're now forming a
therapeutic attachment with me,</i>

15:15.351 --> 15:17.840
<i>will help you break
through those painful...</i>

15:17.866 --> 15:20.776
<i>replacing emotional responses
with positive ones.</i>

15:20.802 --> 15:22.864
<i>You'll development the
capacity for empathy.</i>

15:26.764 --> 15:28.129
<i>I'd like that.</i>

15:28.736 --> 15:29.942
<i>Good.</i>

15:34.989 --> 15:36.196
Officer?

15:40.156 --> 15:41.738
I'd like to meet with the peer worker.

15:45.145 --> 15:46.353
- Smith,

15:46.658 --> 15:48.188
is that laundry for the conjugal?

15:48.216 --> 15:50.381
- Yeah.
- I'll take over from here, thanks.

15:50.406 --> 15:51.613
Go.

15:55.404 --> 15:57.280
What are the women
saying about Ferguson?

15:57.305 --> 15:58.883
What do you think? They wanna kill her.

15:58.908 --> 16:00.416
Officers reckon I
should've let her burn.

16:00.441 --> 16:01.680
Yeah, well...

16:05.027 --> 16:07.027
Any clues as to why she
wants to be in general?

16:07.052 --> 16:10.492
I have no idea. Vera won't
let me anywhere near her.

16:10.837 --> 16:12.795
So, watch your back.

16:12.820 --> 16:15.566
Well, it's just one of her against
a whole lot of women who hate her...

16:15.591 --> 16:18.223
Yeah, still, don't underestimate
what she's capable of.

16:18.962 --> 16:20.825
Well, you better watch
your back too then, huh?

16:20.864 --> 16:22.654
It's only a couple of
months until her trial.

16:22.672 --> 16:24.365
Until then, we just have to manage her.

16:25.224 --> 16:27.817
...the sheets.
Nah, she wasn't there...

16:28.177 --> 16:29.682
<i>Would you look at that!</i>

16:30.048 --> 16:32.661
If they're not already rooting
they sure as hell want to.

16:39.513 --> 16:40.720
Hey...

16:41.516 --> 16:44.617
What's, ah, what's with you and Jackson?

16:44.911 --> 16:46.248
Nothing.

16:46.273 --> 16:47.480
You porkin' him?

16:47.505 --> 16:48.712
What?

16:49.169 --> 16:50.494
But you like him?

16:51.282 --> 16:53.321
That's none of your business.

16:56.194 --> 16:57.938
There must be a mistake...

16:57.963 --> 16:59.997
a whole bunch of other
women are getting conjugals.

17:00.022 --> 17:02.681
- I should've been approved.
- It's not a mistake.

17:03.343 --> 17:05.022
I can't take any risks
with this program.

17:05.048 --> 17:06.635
It was hard enough convincing the board.

17:06.661 --> 17:08.051
Why am I at risk?

17:08.192 --> 17:10.075
Do I really need to spell it out?

17:13.242 --> 17:17.021
You had sex with a man, in the
prison grounds, and got pregnant.

17:17.047 --> 17:19.329
You are a poster girl
for the board's concerns.

17:19.354 --> 17:22.670
I won't get pregnant again, I'm
on the contraceptive program,

17:22.896 --> 17:25.497
and I'm peer worker.
Surely I'm entitled to some

17:25.521 --> 17:27.344
- privileges.
- I'm sorry, it's not happening.

17:27.368 --> 17:31.150
But, regarding your
peer worker status...

17:32.211 --> 17:34.633
Joan Ferguson has requested a visit.

17:35.561 --> 17:36.770
Ferguson?

17:36.927 --> 17:38.215
There's no pressure.

17:38.617 --> 17:41.172
I am just obliged to
pass on the message.

17:42.268 --> 17:44.565
You can say no, if you want to.

17:45.277 --> 17:47.432
I'm not doin' it. She's nuts!

17:47.524 --> 17:50.097
Ugh, she might try and pash
you again, eh?

17:50.123 --> 17:52.270
- You know, stick the tongue in.
- Oh, come one.

17:52.296 --> 17:54.070
Oh, it's your nightmare come true.

17:54.095 --> 17:55.763
Ah, shut up, Boomer.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.188
Well, it's more action
than you're gettin'

17:57.214 --> 17:59.092
- from Nash.
- Booms... stop it.

17:59.366 --> 18:01.304
Conway, you're due in medical.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.606
Are you sick?

18:03.798 --> 18:05.310
- Funny tummy.
- Oh.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.036
You'll be right, love.

18:07.438 --> 18:09.260
Doreen, come here.

18:14.252 --> 18:15.709
I need you to go and see Ferguson.

18:15.911 --> 18:18.417
You go see her. I don't
feel safe with her.

18:18.443 --> 18:21.013
Well, there's a guard outside her
door, she's not gonna try anything.

18:21.038 --> 18:24.727
She'll talk to you... and we can
find out if she's up to anything.

18:24.972 --> 18:26.544
- I'm not doin' it.
- Doreen!

18:27.600 --> 18:28.983
I'm not asking.

18:37.413 --> 18:38.620
Doreen...

18:39.652 --> 18:41.583
come on in, please, sit down.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.346
I'm here as peer
worker... what do you want?

18:46.682 --> 18:47.971
I'd like a shower...

18:48.877 --> 18:50.857
- and an airing.
- Seems fair enough.

18:51.321 --> 18:54.033
- We'll ask the Governor.
- How's little Joshua?

18:55.025 --> 18:56.233
He's good.

18:56.258 --> 18:58.402
I wouldn't mind saying hello sometime.

18:58.468 --> 19:00.957
He's with his dad now, on the outside.

19:02.692 --> 19:04.827
That... that's a wise decision.

19:06.392 --> 19:09.105
Has anybody told you what
really happened in the fire?

19:11.632 --> 19:13.370
When I found little Joshua,

19:13.854 --> 19:15.148
Warner had him.

19:17.660 --> 19:19.096
He was screaming.

19:19.464 --> 19:21.042
She was trying to smother him.

19:21.791 --> 19:23.778
She was deranged, Doreen.

19:24.682 --> 19:26.853
I had to wrench him from her arms,

19:26.878 --> 19:29.378
but before we could get
away, she-she started a fire.

19:29.535 --> 19:33.505
The gate shorted and we were trapped.
That's when Bea Smith found us.

19:34.118 --> 19:35.581
What happened to Jess?

19:35.606 --> 19:37.176
We lost her in the flames.

19:39.905 --> 19:43.479
I couldn't save Warner,
but I did save your son.

19:46.324 --> 19:47.532
Thank you.

19:48.082 --> 19:49.826
He was just a little baby, Doreen,

19:50.354 --> 19:51.931
anybody would have done the same.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.841
I miss him.

20:05.194 --> 20:06.460

could let him go...

20:12.709 --> 20:15.890
that just demonstrates
what a fine mother you are.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.039
Is that all she said?

20:26.198 --> 20:28.196
And she asked for an
airing and a shower.

- Yeah.

me you didn't eat lunch.

It was brought in fresh, the
inmates didn't prepare it.

21:33.808 --> 21:35.014
Wasn't hungry.

21:35.104 --> 21:36.863
Anderson passed on your requests.

21:36.888 --> 21:40.257
I can organise a shower for you
later, but I can't give you an airing.

21:40.282 --> 21:41.491
Why not?

21:42.091 --> 21:43.467
Because you'll be lynched.

21:44.795 --> 21:46.489
Maybe it's what I deserve.

21:48.726 --> 21:50.588
Maybe they need to get
it out of their system.

21:50.712 --> 21:52.134
Do you have a death wish?

21:52.342 --> 21:54.575
I'll have to integrate with
the women sooner or later.

You can go outside
tonight, after lockdown.

21:57.979 --> 21:59.661
I'd like to sit in the sunshine.
