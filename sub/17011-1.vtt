04:02.632 --> 04:04.160
Hello?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.273
<i>I knew it.</i>
<i>Late again, aren't you?</i>

04:06.354 --> 04:08.918
Dad? No, I'm in the elevator.
I might lose you.

04:09.001 --> 04:12.067
- Why'd your number come up "private"?
<i>- Because I blocked it.</i>

04:12.147 --> 04:16.478
<i>I get you a job, which wasn't easy</i>
<i>with that gaping hole in your résumé...</i>

04:16.559 --> 04:19.242
There are no hole...
I was working in Mexico, Dad.

04:19.321 --> 04:21.458
<i>Bartending doesn't count</i>
<i>in the real world.</i>

04:21.545 --> 04:25.375
<i>- It's my good name you're smearing.</i>
- Nothing's been smeared.

04:25.458 --> 04:28.449
<i>I'm just glad your poor mother</i>
<i>isn't alive to hear this.</i>

04:28.528 --> 04:32.052
It's been a month. You're not allowed
to use her in our petty arguments.

04:32.134 --> 04:35.353
Dad, can you hear me? Hello?

04:35.433 --> 04:37.005
Jesus Christ!

04:38.004 --> 04:39.956
- Nice of you to join us.
- Oh, yeah.

04:40.037 --> 04:42.251
I think I just met
my future wife, actually.

04:42.338 --> 04:44.401
Yeah, right.

04:44.486 --> 04:46.943
- Hey, Tom.
- Yeah?

04:47.019 --> 04:49.048
That doesn't count.

04:51.775 --> 04:54.765
- Yeah, clinically tested.
- Maureen would like to see you.

04:54.844 --> 04:58.325
- We accept all major credit cards.
- You're not fooling anyone.

04:59.640 --> 05:02.401
- Maureen's been looking for you.
- Did she say why?

05:02.479 --> 05:07.391
No, but I assume
the goodwill train has derailed.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.340
- Yo, Ed.
- What?

05:10.420 --> 05:13.137
- ¶ <i>Got ya, I got ya</i>
- This little game?

05:14.294 --> 05:16.477
- Dumb.
- You're right.

05:17.939 --> 05:20.045
Oh, wait, seriously, about yesterday.

05:38.464 --> 05:40.264
- Boss needs these.
- Alright.

05:40.343 --> 05:42.066
OK.

05:42.146 --> 05:44.055
Hey, Cooper.

05:45.023 --> 05:47.893
Damn. Another point.

05:47.977 --> 05:51.883
- Just give me five more minutes.
- Maureen, I'm filing. I'm busy.

05:51.967 --> 05:54.878
- We'll talk on Monday.
- Come in.

05:54.958 --> 05:57.293
- I'll be right down, sweetie.
<i>- I'll be waiting.</i>

05:57.376 --> 05:58.641
Sit down.

06:03.399 --> 06:05.887
Quality control emailed me this.

06:05.969 --> 06:08.457
<i>I want</i>
<i>the money-back guarantee.</i>

06:08.540 --> 06:11.408
<i>- I'm not authorised to...</i>
<i>- Are you being smart?</i>

06:11.493 --> 06:15.597
<i>No. If I were, I'd simply make</i>
<i>fun of you for buying herbal Viagra.</i>

06:15.676 --> 06:19.003
<i>- Let me speak to your manager.</i>
<i>- Sure. Please hold.</i>

06:19.090 --> 06:23.115
<i>- This is his manager. How can I help?</i>
<i>- That's still you!</i>

06:23.999 --> 06:27.327
- I think I should quit.
- I'm about to fire you.

06:27.414 --> 06:30.894
- I'll still give you two weeks.
- Thanks, but I don't want 'em.

06:32.018 --> 06:33.927
I have an appointment to get to.

06:38.770 --> 06:41.409
You know, I stuck my neck out

06:41.492 --> 06:44.405
because I knew it was a difficult time 
for you and your dad.

06:44.485 --> 06:49.200
To repay me, you show up late,
turn away callers,

06:49.282 --> 06:51.419
get everyone playing games
on the floor...

09:24.649 --> 09:26.678
Hello?

09:39.036 --> 09:40.181
Maureen.

09:41.758 --> 09:43.515
Maureen, it's Cooper.

09:43.601 --> 09:45.509
Hey, Maureen.

09:47.092 --> 09:49.001
Hey. Hi.

09:49.931 --> 09:51.000
- Hello?
- What?

09:51.081 --> 09:54.377
Hi. Hey, everything's...
Everything's gonna be...

09:56.951 --> 09:58.860
It's gonna be OK.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.090
You know, 
my watch says it's the 26th,

10:02.167 --> 10:05.802
so I think that means
we've been out since Friday.

10:05.890 --> 10:10.374
- Hey, Ed. Wake up, big guy.
- I don't remember any break-in.

10:10.455 --> 10:12.330
What do these people want?

10:13.293 --> 10:17.930
I got in a fight with a giant, er... 
a giant bug.

10:18.011 --> 10:21.382
Yeah. About yea big.
About three feet long.

10:21.463 --> 10:23.341
Oh, jeez.

10:23.422 --> 10:26.105
Yeah, that's... that's normal.
Get that out of there.

10:26.184 --> 10:30.210
- What's happening?
- Where... are we?

10:31.055 --> 10:33.510
In the office.

10:34.545 --> 10:37.339
Er, what's the last thing you remember?

10:37.423 --> 10:39.146
I...

10:39.226 --> 10:41.211
Morning meeting. Er...

10:42.487 --> 10:44.135
Conference call with...

10:44.213 --> 10:47.465
Oh, my God. Sara. 
I have a daughter.

10:47.551 --> 10:50.007
I know. I'm really worried
about my family, too.

10:50.084 --> 10:52.723
She's outside in a car.
She was picking me up.

10:52.807 --> 10:56.025
Hey, wait! Maureen,
there could be more things out there!

10:56.105 --> 10:57.208
More what?

10:59.444 --> 11:01.243
Oh!

11:01.323 --> 11:03.691
Oh, God!

11:03.779 --> 11:06.878
- Oh... Oh, no!
- Maureen, Maureen, Maureen.

11:06.963 --> 11:10.912
Stop, stop, stop. It doesn't feel good
out here. We should go back inside.

11:10.991 --> 11:13.784
- Sara!
- Is that... That's your daughter?

11:13.867 --> 11:15.591
- Yes.
- In that car? OK, alright.

11:15.671 --> 11:19.392
I'll go get her and then
we'll all go back inside together, OK?

11:19.469 --> 11:21.879
I'll be right back.
I'll be right back, OK?

11:25.875 --> 11:26.824
Excuse me.

11:28.868 --> 11:31.202
Hello? Hello?

11:31.285 --> 11:33.194
Hi. Lady.

11:34.814 --> 11:36.844
Hey, come on. We gotta get up.

11:36.925 --> 11:39.837
Hey. Come on.

11:39.917 --> 11:41.715
Come on. OK.

11:41.795 --> 11:45.592
Come here. OK, come here.
We gotta go right now, OK?

11:45.670 --> 11:47.241
Can you walk?

11:47.319 --> 11:49.776
- Oh, my baby!
- No, Maureen. Maureen.

11:49.852 --> 11:53.256
Alright, we gotta get you out of here.
Rip these off. Get 'em off.

11:53.344 --> 11:54.991
- Stop it.
- I'm trying to help you.

11:55.070 --> 11:57.404
- Let me go.
- What have they done to her?

12:00.325 --> 12:02.430
Mom?

12:02.512 --> 12:04.496
- Mom!
- Come on.

12:04.582 --> 12:07.190
We gotta get out of here right now.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.368
Come on. You gotta get us
inside somewhere right now.

12:11.795 --> 12:13.900
Come on. I can't see.

12:17.243 --> 12:19.426
Slow down. Are they following us?

12:31.207 --> 12:33.617
Oh, my God. I can hear them.

12:41.871 --> 12:44.402
What did you do to them?

12:44.480 --> 12:47.351
- Which building?
- Doesn't matter. Any one.

12:48.433 --> 12:50.766
Ow! God!

12:50.849 --> 12:55.180
- What happened to my mother?
- I wish I knew.

12:55.260 --> 12:58.326
- Is she dead?
- I don't know.

12:58.406 --> 12:59.355
What do you know?

12:59.441 --> 13:02.278
Look, I've been awake
ten minutes longer than you.

13:02.357 --> 13:03.884
Right.

13:04.967 --> 13:08.186
What are you doing?
No. I made that mistake already.

13:08.266 --> 13:10.874
Now's not the right time
to be waking people up, OK?

13:10.952 --> 13:12.292
You ever hear of teamwork?

13:12.370 --> 13:14.857
Anything can happen
when you wake somebody up.

13:14.940 --> 13:18.268
These are human beings in cocoons.
We can't leave them like this.

13:18.354 --> 13:21.192
You wake everyone up,
you gotta give an explanation,

13:21.271 --> 13:23.681
and then everyone goes off
on their own tangents.

13:23.764 --> 13:26.404
So I'm thinking
the safest place for these people

13:26.488 --> 13:28.364
is to be in the cocoons.

13:28.445 --> 13:30.245
Oh, sh... Oh, shit!

13:30.324 --> 13:33.193
Oh! Oh, shit!

13:40.797 --> 13:44.550
- Please...
- Oh, God! Oh, God!

13:58.636 --> 14:01.124
Now can we chill the fuck out? Alright?

14:01.206 --> 14:05.385
Get our bearings, form a plan?
What are you doing?

14:05.463 --> 14:08.716
You're really gonna wake people up
after what just happened to you?

14:08.801 --> 14:12.707
- I'm waking everyone in this room.
- What is she?

14:13.481 --> 14:17.432
OK, I know
this is all very confusing.

14:17.511 --> 14:19.999
Cooper and I don't have
many answers for you.

14:20.081 --> 14:23.375
But what we do know
is that there seems to be bugs,

14:23.455 --> 14:28.050
like this dead one on the floor,
crawling all over the place.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.660
And there are flying ones, too.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.156
Whoa. Something's moving out there.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.453
Something just came out
of that storm drain.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.756
- Gross.
- See it? Right over there.

14:37.843 --> 14:40.298
Those are huge, man.

14:41.526 --> 14:45.659
Who's in charge here?
I mean, who do we listen to, you know?

14:45.744 --> 14:46.813
Yeah.

14:46.895 --> 14:48.771
Listen up. I got a truck outside.

14:48.851 --> 14:50.456
It's diesel. Strong as an ox.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.835
Starting an engine could be a bad idea.
They like noise.

14:53.916 --> 14:57.058
We could wait it out, stay here?

14:57.139 --> 14:59.856
Someone more equipped than us
should be working on this.

14:59.939 --> 15:01.358
What if they ain't?

15:01.436 --> 15:04.119
If we woke up
as many people as possible,

15:04.197 --> 15:06.107
we could be too much
for them to control.

15:06.192 --> 15:08.909
They controlled us
or we wouldn't be in this situation.

15:08.992 --> 15:11.556
- He's right. He is.
- How close is your truck?

15:11.640 --> 15:14.006
- Out front.
- Hey, dude. Feel better?

15:14.900 --> 15:17.115
Puking's normal.
You got some on your shirt.

15:17.202 --> 15:19.995
- I understand.
- Did you reach anyone on the radio?

15:20.080 --> 15:23.876
- Let's just all sit tight, everybody.
- Jackass, we're not gonna sit tight.

15:23.954 --> 15:26.289
- Stand down, sir.
- Oh, stand down?

15:26.372 --> 15:28.477
Are you gonna fuckin' shoot me,
tough guy?

15:28.558 --> 15:31.623
- I'm not gonna tell you again, sir!
- I'm not standing down!

15:31.703 --> 15:34.267
Guys! Can we not go all...

15:34.350 --> 15:35.571
Shh!

15:36.652 --> 15:39.259
<i>... Thunderdome</i> on everybody, yeah?

15:39.337 --> 15:43.746
Look, can you just tell us
if anybody answered the...

15:45.130 --> 15:48.077
No. Nobody is out there.

15:48.161 --> 15:50.071
- I'm leaving.
- Me, too.

15:50.157 --> 15:51.880
- To where?
- To the North End.

15:51.959 --> 15:54.173
Good idea.
My brother and his wife live there.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.016
Fine. Let's move.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.810
It's so quiet.

16:06.268 --> 16:07.610
Hey.

16:07.687 --> 16:10.601
Sorry.
I hope you know what you're doing.

16:10.681 --> 16:11.945
- Come on.
- OK.

16:14.938 --> 16:18.265
We live just north of here.
You think it's a bad idea, too?

16:23.953 --> 16:25.863
It's your funeral, lady.

16:36.651 --> 16:37.994
Come to Papa.

16:40.525 --> 16:43.592
- Now, that's what I'm talking about.
- Maybe they had a point.

16:43.671 --> 16:46.432
- Goddamn it!
- It's a big truck.

16:48.812 --> 16:50.994
Wait for me!

16:53.033 --> 16:54.907
Jesus!

17:01.434 --> 17:03.114
Hey!

17:24.643 --> 17:25.592
No!

17:37.302 --> 17:38.251
Hey.

17:50.653 --> 17:52.563
Come on!

17:56.521 --> 17:57.820
No, son!

18:01.049 --> 18:03.263
You OK? Come on. Oh, shit!

18:03.351 --> 18:05.532
Come on!

18:05.614 --> 18:07.873
Come on, come on. Hurry!

18:11.216 --> 18:13.124
Slow down.

18:15.627 --> 18:19.762
- Hey, did that thing sting you?
- Bastard snuck up on me.

18:20.882 --> 18:23.795
- Stung you? Let me see.
- It's nothing.

18:23.874 --> 18:26.057
Well, then, show me.

18:28.901 --> 18:31.083
Ugh.
Oh.

18:31.164 --> 18:34.688
- It just missed your spine.
- How do you know what you're doing?

18:35.460 --> 18:36.604
I'm a doctor.

18:38.990 --> 18:40.516
- How do you feel?
- Pissed off!

18:40.600 --> 18:43.514
- Shh! Shh!
- I'm fine.

18:43.594 --> 18:47.226
- What do we do now?
- Perhaps we need some perspective.

18:47.314 --> 18:49.039
- Come on.
- OK.

18:49.118 --> 18:50.295
- Come on.
- Let's go.

18:50.384 --> 18:52.751
- Cindy.
- OK.

19:08.069 --> 19:10.632
It's a fire.
The smoke would be black.

19:10.716 --> 19:14.163
- It's the sunset, then.
- No, that's east. The sun sets over...

19:15.434 --> 19:19.800
- Jesus.
- Oh, God. What is that?

19:19.885 --> 19:23.637
- It's a swarm of them.
- It's headed away from us.

19:23.721 --> 19:27.627
Maybe they think
that they've dealt with this quadrant.

19:27.710 --> 19:30.580
Do we stay here? Do we go somewhere?
What are we doing?

19:30.664 --> 19:34.145
- The government'll do something.
- You wanna wait around for FEMA?

19:34.231 --> 19:36.217
There's an air-force base
in Gibsonton.

19:36.304 --> 19:39.403
Holy shit. My dad's in Berwick.
That's halfway to Gibsonton.

19:39.488 --> 19:43.973
He's got a bomb shelter. OK, it's got,
like, food, water, medical supplies.

19:44.053 --> 19:48.002
- A shortwave radio even.
- Is he some paranoid nutjob?

19:48.081 --> 19:50.873
Pretty much, yeah.
He's retired military, so...

19:50.958 --> 19:54.329
But, anyway, if we walk tomorrow,
we can get there by tomorrow night,

19:54.411 --> 19:56.243
you know, by dark.

19:57.288 --> 20:00.660
Berwick is northeast from here. It's...

20:02.122 --> 20:04.653
That way. Or that way.

20:04.730 --> 20:08.101
- Anyway, it's away from that swarm.
- We got an hour of daylight left.

20:08.182 --> 20:10.713
I say we find a room where we can all...

20:13.478 --> 20:15.386
These things won't quit.

20:30.203 --> 20:32.920
- There's one advantage we have.
- They're blind.

20:33.004 --> 20:35.458
Yeah, well,
maybe we should find out more.

20:49.116 --> 20:52.750
- Looks like a mutant lobster.
- Let's melt some butter and have...

20:52.838 --> 20:55.203
Whoa!
He's not liking this very much.

20:55.291 --> 20:57.474
- OK, so what now?
- We milk it.

20:57.555 --> 20:59.311
Erm, excuse me?

20:59.397 --> 21:03.991
Like a snake. We get it to bite into
a container and I'll examine its venom.

21:04.078 --> 21:06.030
- What are you?
- A student.

21:06.111 --> 21:09.636
- Shiatsu massage.
- I'm gonna pretend that makes sense.

21:09.717 --> 21:12.401
There's a drugstore nearby
with supplies I can use.

21:12.479 --> 21:16.232
- I'll get them. You collect the venom?
- Whoa. You want us to do that?

21:16.314 --> 21:19.762
- You'd rather go outside?
- No. We got it.

21:19.844 --> 21:21.753
- Er...
- Hugo.

21:21.838 --> 21:23.750
Come on.

21:24.908 --> 21:26.938
We're... We're doing this?

21:39.754 --> 21:42.243
- I'm spotting you.
- Put your hands on the door.

21:42.325 --> 21:46.122
- We'll use our feet to brace it.
- The floor's slippery, so I thought...

21:46.199 --> 21:49.757
- You know what? I think it'll work.
- OK. Crack it open.

21:51.724 --> 21:53.098
- Oh!
- Push.

21:53.758 --> 21:56.124
- Come on. Come on.
- Hold it.

21:57.056 --> 21:58.704
Yeah, that's right.

22:00.739 --> 22:03.195
I remember bits of the day before

22:03.271 --> 22:06.337
but nothing about the morning
it must have happened.

22:06.915 --> 22:10.473
My mind's Swiss-cheesed,
but I get flashes of things.

22:10.559 --> 22:15.348
Driving to work, you know,
and calling Hugo for lunch.

22:15.431 --> 22:18.149
And you standing above me.

22:18.233 --> 22:19.804
I remember being fired.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.056
And then... a noise,

22:25.139 --> 22:29.240
like, erm, like a high-pitched, er...
like a dog whistle.

22:29.319 --> 22:32.919
- It hurt.
- Yeah, right. Yeah, it hurt. Yeah.

22:33.002 --> 22:34.912
I thought it was a fire alarm,

22:34.998 --> 22:39.438
and then the... person in front of me
in line doubled over,

22:39.524 --> 22:43.082
and then I just fell to the floor.

23:00.968 --> 23:04.842
Erm, it's a sedative,
but it's a protein, too.

23:04.920 --> 23:07.286
- How'd you figure that?
- It kept us sleeping.

23:07.374 --> 23:10.365
And pregnancy tests,
they detect complex proteins.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.659
I just used one of those.

23:13.935 --> 23:16.923
- I never would have thought of that.
- Why keep us alive?

23:17.003 --> 23:18.422
Fresh meat?

23:18.500 --> 23:21.063
Red gas is gathering
on top of the janitor closet.

23:21.147 --> 23:22.489
Like in the sky?

23:22.567 --> 23:24.672
They exhale it,
but I don't know what it is.

23:24.753 --> 23:28.780
Tomorrow, when we go to Cooper's
dad's house, we gotta stop by my place.

23:28.859 --> 23:31.772
- Mama's sick.
- Well, I wanna see my brother.

23:31.851 --> 23:35.025
- OK. We can work that into the plan.
- You know, about the plan.

23:35.111 --> 23:40.096
I've been doing some thinking
about my dad's, and, er...

23:42.822 --> 23:46.302
Forget it. Sorry. Just... I'm tired.

23:46.389 --> 23:49.303
OK. I think it's best
that we start preparing for night.

23:49.383 --> 23:53.518
We'll work out a watch schedule
and rotate every hour.

24:00.813 --> 24:02.766
Ow!

24:02.846 --> 24:06.720
Ow. It's... It's crazy.
You're not even sweating. It's...

24:06.798 --> 24:11.545
I know it's been only one desk,
but you're a pretty strong guy, huh?

24:12.821 --> 24:17.000
So you hear OK?
With the aids? The hearing aids, yeah?

24:17.079 --> 24:20.451
I had ear infections as a kid.

24:20.532 --> 24:24.941
So I'd lose my hearing, you know,
a couple of weeks at a time.

24:25.022 --> 24:28.851
It wasn't the pain
that bothered me so much as...

24:28.934 --> 24:31.804
It was a little lonely, that's all.

24:33.307 --> 24:38.862
- Hey, what's the hold-up?
- Just feng shui-ing our hideout, man.

24:41.671 --> 24:43.319
On three. One, two, three.

24:51.683 --> 24:53.177
Hey.

24:53.255 --> 24:56.933
We were looking for bedding in
the employee lounge and I found these.

24:57.015 --> 24:59.001
Congratulations.

24:59.087 --> 25:04.642
Er... They're for you, actually.
I noticed you're in heels.

25:05.303 --> 25:08.858
We'll be doing a lot of walking.
Heels are loud.

25:14.855 --> 25:16.763
You get what's happening here, right?

25:21.914 --> 25:23.637
Yeah.

25:28.396 --> 25:30.305
Oh!

25:34.151 --> 25:36.060
Hey, you want one of these?

25:37.910 --> 25:42.012
I found them in a desk.
I don't even smoke, you know.

25:42.091 --> 25:45.572
I figured, what the hell.
What a day, huh?

25:45.659 --> 25:48.114
Hey, did you come
to our office Christmas party?

25:49.035 --> 25:52.178
- No.
- Are you on match. com?

25:53.217 --> 25:57.624
Sorry. I just keep thinking that I know
you from somewhere. I don't know.

25:57.705 --> 26:01.186
Maybe your mom had your picture
in her office or something.

26:01.273 --> 26:02.920
Maybe.

26:04.035 --> 26:05.486
Can I sleep with you tonight?

26:07.180 --> 26:10.553
I meant near you, OK?
I barely know you.

26:10.634 --> 26:12.085
Suit yourself.

26:21.260 --> 26:25.667
That's really good. I'm OK. I'm OK.
I got this area covered.

26:26.669 --> 26:28.043
Sweet dreams.

26:54.252 --> 26:55.900
Oh!

26:55.978 --> 26:57.962
Ugh!

26:58.049 --> 26:59.576
That's disgusting.

27:00.812 --> 27:02.721
Oh, Jesus! Oh!

27:03.843 --> 27:05.523
You scared the shit out of me.

27:05.607 --> 27:09.818
Oh, my God. I peed a little.

27:09.904 --> 27:12.741
Well, I couldn't sleep.
I thought maybe I was hungry.

27:12.819 --> 27:16.649
Well, you definitely don't want anything
in here, that's for sure.

27:16.733 --> 27:18.641
I got a protein bar in my jacket.

27:26.975 --> 27:30.727
- Here you go.
- You know, I work at WLBZ.

27:32.576 --> 27:35.413
Oh! Oh, you're the weather lady.

27:35.491 --> 27:38.055
- Oh, that's awesome.
- You know, we could go there.

27:38.138 --> 27:41.936
They're hooked up to communication
satellites all over the world.

27:42.014 --> 27:44.425
- We could see how widespread this is.
- Yeah.

27:44.507 --> 27:46.919
We should bring it up to the group
in the morning.

27:47.002 --> 27:51.746
Well, I mean that... <i>we</i> could go.

27:52.908 --> 27:55.320
Erm... That's...

27:57.588 --> 28:00.534
We can't leave them, though, right?

28:00.619 --> 28:01.721
No.

28:02.845 --> 28:05.757
- I didn't mean...
- That's OK.

28:05.837 --> 28:06.786
I just...

28:10.670 --> 28:13.582
Hey, hey, hey.

28:13.662 --> 28:15.310
Look, erm...

28:15.389 --> 28:19.262
It's gonna be OK, alright?
We're gonna figure this thing out.

28:19.340 --> 28:22.024
- Do you really believe that?
- Yeah.

28:22.102 --> 28:25.015
I am so glad that we found each other.

28:33.611 --> 28:35.029
Erm...

28:35.107 --> 28:36.983
What are the chances, you know?

28:47.536 --> 28:49.447
Right.

28:51.297 --> 28:55.050
I should... focus on lookout.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.776
That's for you.

28:58.661 --> 29:00.570
It's blueberry.

29:02.882 --> 29:04.791
OK.

29:16.808 --> 29:18.946
Open the door. Back up.

29:20.796 --> 29:22.706
Is this a good idea?

29:26.360 --> 29:28.040
Watch out!

29:34.646 --> 29:37.744
- What was it doing?
- Calling for help.

29:38.597 --> 29:39.545
OK.

30:03.380 --> 30:05.290
Cindy?

30:06.104 --> 30:07.173
It's time to go.

30:08.865 --> 30:10.850
I won't be joining you.

30:10.936 --> 30:15.923
It makes sense that someone remains,
wakes up as many people as possible.

30:17.613 --> 30:18.758
It's what I need to do.

30:34.031 --> 30:36.563
Guess you're kind of a loner, huh?

30:36.640 --> 30:39.662
Me? What, because I'm 20 feet ahead?

30:41.129 --> 30:43.310
That, and you haven't said very much.

30:43.392 --> 30:45.040
What do you wanna hear?

30:46.499 --> 30:49.182
Tell me about your boyfriend.

30:49.261 --> 30:52.174
- Got it. Thank you for that.
- Got what?

30:52.253 --> 30:55.701
The final piece
to the kind of guy you are.

30:55.783 --> 30:58.391
Really? Wow. Do tell.

30:58.468 --> 31:01.305
You're shallow. Solipsistic.

31:01.384 --> 31:05.868
Pathologically witty to cope with
family stress. Father issues, obviously.

31:05.949 --> 31:08.785
You consider yourself spiritual,
just so you can meet women.

31:08.864 --> 31:10.970
Feelings weren't honoured in your home,

31:11.052 --> 31:13.540
so you stopped developing them
around 14,

31:13.622 --> 31:16.414
leaving you
severely emotionally retarded.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.373
I prefer "challenged", by the way.

31:18.454 --> 31:22.481
You know, I tended bar
in a little cantina down in Mexico.

31:22.559 --> 31:25.429
- Got good at reading people myself.
- Take your best shot.

31:26.435 --> 31:29.152
You grew up on a farm.
The boys found you quickly.

31:29.235 --> 31:32.105
All those sticky fumblings
in the back of a car.

31:32.880 --> 31:36.830
All the while dreaming of getting out,
getting anywhere, all the way to the...

31:36.909 --> 31:39.318
The FBI. Cute.

31:39.400 --> 31:42.117
<i>- Silence of the Lambs?</i>
- Yep.

31:42.201 --> 31:44.111
You like movies?

31:44.771 --> 31:46.681
I'm gonna walk ahead now.

31:49.414 --> 31:51.945
Fine. I'll just walk by myself.

31:57.087 --> 31:59.770
This is where you live?

31:59.848 --> 32:02.870
- That's right.
- I'm gonna stay outside.

32:04.759 --> 32:08.392
Er, me, too.
I'll keep an eye on things.

32:39.323 --> 32:41.004
Oh!

32:58.237 --> 32:59.611
What the?

33:06.601 --> 33:08.019
What's wrong?

33:12.737 --> 33:14.646
I think she's dead.

33:14.732 --> 33:16.872
What, from the cocoon?

33:17.994 --> 33:21.135
They, er, they didn't web her,
you know. They...

33:21.215 --> 33:26.006
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe it's because she was too weak.

33:26.702 --> 33:28.578
Or she'd already died.

33:32.494 --> 33:34.099
You still have those smokes?

33:35.679 --> 33:38.210
Yeah. Yeah, I still got... Yeah.

33:38.287 --> 33:40.927
Hell, yeah, I still got those smokes.

33:43.619 --> 33:45.682
I picked the wrong time to quit.

33:52.290 --> 33:54.200
I'm worried about her.

33:59.386 --> 34:01.841
Yeah. Ugh!

34:06.215 --> 34:07.742
We're done here.

34:11.126 --> 34:12.545
Is that a gun?

34:15.576 --> 34:17.485
I'll... I'll go talk to him.

34:20.409 --> 34:24.587
I'm really sorry, Al,
but, er, the gun, erm...

34:24.667 --> 34:27.734
You know, if you use it,
there's only gonna be more of them.

34:27.813 --> 34:32.069
Yeah, well,
in case we run out of options,

34:32.149 --> 34:34.058
I wanna know it's with me.

34:40.626 --> 34:42.536
He's fine. He's fine.

34:43.925 --> 34:45.835
- Yeah.
- Come on.

34:50.408 --> 34:53.627
I think it's just, you know,
like a safety blanket, you know?

34:53.708 --> 34:55.771
- Right.
- Yeah.

34:55.857 --> 34:59.185
- Like Linus, but with a 12-gauge.
- Yeah.

35:01.687 --> 35:04.296
- Chad! Susan!
- Shh!

35:05.295 --> 35:07.934
It's me! It's Cindy!

35:17.838 --> 35:20.554
- Your brother's family?
- No.

35:20.638 --> 35:23.628
- Neighbours.
- Why are they here?

35:23.708 --> 35:26.425
Why are they all gathered
in a clump together?

35:26.509 --> 35:29.498
Susan? Susan!

35:29.578 --> 35:31.224
It's me.

35:31.303 --> 35:33.911
- Susan.
- Something carried them here?

35:33.988 --> 35:36.858
Or dragged 'em.

35:36.942 --> 35:39.006
Susan.

35:39.092 --> 35:41.230
Come on. Wake up. Wake up, Susan.

35:42.774 --> 35:44.225
Can you see me?

35:45.958 --> 35:48.796
Don't just stand there. Do something.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.051
Chad?

35:59.040 --> 36:00.337
Al, don't.

36:05.484 --> 36:06.510
No!

36:06.597 --> 36:09.390
Chad. Chad, it's me!

36:30.842 --> 36:32.261
Oh!

36:39.244 --> 36:42.768
- You're killing him!
- No shit!

36:45.074 --> 36:46.144
Chad.

36:49.410 --> 36:52.509
- How bad?
- Oh, I've done worse shaving.

36:53.707 --> 36:56.577
Oh! Oh, yeah, way worse.

37:00.574 --> 37:02.831
- No more. No more.
- You sure?

37:03.795 --> 37:06.010
I'm good. I'm solid.

37:09.743 --> 37:14.030
- What the hell was that thing?
- Some kind of hybrid. Us and them.

37:14.116 --> 37:16.986
Look, I understand them
wanting to eat us,

37:17.070 --> 37:19.601
but how does that fit into their plan?

37:19.679 --> 37:22.820
He was doing a job. Yeah.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.152
Carrying little cocoons around.
Collecting them.

37:26.238 --> 37:29.839
- I mean, that thing's screwed up.
- That "thing" was my brother.

37:29.921 --> 37:32.713
I know. I'm sorry. He seemed nice.

37:32.798 --> 37:35.361
Just shut up.
I've had enough of you people.

37:37.900 --> 37:40.770
Even post-apocalypse,
I'm the drunk asshole.

37:40.854 --> 37:42.195
Hm-hmm.

37:42.273 --> 37:43.343
Ow!

37:43.425 --> 37:45.881
God! A little warning next time, please.

37:45.957 --> 37:49.906
- That's gonna sting.
- Oh. I get it. That's funny.

37:49.985 --> 37:53.312
Listen, we're gonna go check
the doors and windows,

37:53.399 --> 37:55.428
make sure everything's locked up.

37:55.508 --> 37:56.457
Come on, son.

37:56.544 --> 38:00.451
Listen to me. This is really important.

38:00.535 --> 38:03.601
I need you to do me a favour.

38:04.524 --> 38:09.347
If I ever turn into one of those things
and you're holding a shotgun...

38:10.701 --> 38:13.689
...don't... hurt me.

38:15.418 --> 38:16.411
Just run away.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.595
OK?

38:22.478 --> 38:27.072
I used to want something like this to
happen, some kind of cataclysmic event.

38:27.159 --> 38:29.842
It seemed really sexy
for it to come down to, like,

38:29.921 --> 38:34.360
me and a dog and a woman
and a muscle car.

38:34.446 --> 38:38.703
We'd find a cabin in the woods and do
our part to repopulate the planet.

38:38.782 --> 38:42.961
At night we'd, like, tell our feral,
spiky-haired little children

38:43.040 --> 38:46.412
stories of, er, of "the before times".

38:47.375 --> 38:51.281
When I was young,
before I knew it wasn't a real job,

38:52.132 --> 38:54.850
I used to wanna grow up
and be a motorcycle girl.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.461
That's awesome.

38:57.810 --> 39:00.373
Seriously, I could totally
see you doing that.

39:00.457 --> 39:02.366
Uh-huh.

39:02.451 --> 39:04.742
- I have a confession to make.
- OK.

39:07.553 --> 39:09.889
You <i>are</i> on match. com?

39:09.971 --> 39:12.688
- No.
- Oh. Neither am I.

39:12.772 --> 39:15.260
I'm not a medical doctor.

39:16.340 --> 39:20.779
I have my doctorate. Erm...
Well, I'm getting my doctorate.

39:20.865 --> 39:22.698
In what?

39:22.783 --> 39:24.888
Psychology.

39:24.970 --> 39:27.458
Got it. Thanks for that.

39:27.540 --> 39:31.414
The final piece of the puzzle that tells
me the type of girl you really are.

39:31.492 --> 39:35.093
I stretched the truth
because I don't like to be questioned.

39:35.175 --> 39:36.245
Why not?

39:38.513 --> 39:41.305
OK, you're right. I'm sorry.
That was a question. I get it.

39:41.390 --> 39:42.884
- Hold still.
- Wait.

39:42.963 --> 39:45.679
OK, I gotta know
a few things about you first.

39:45.763 --> 39:48.863
When's your birthday?
I mean, what sign are you?

39:48.948 --> 39:51.162
Are you stalling right now?

39:51.250 --> 39:52.668
- Stalling?
- Yeah.

39:52.745 --> 39:56.346
Why the hell?
No. I just wanna know what time it is.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.228
- Where's the...
- It's time to man up.

39:58.308 --> 40:00.293
No. OK.

40:00.379 --> 40:03.979
Alright. No, wait, no, wait.
I really wanted to tell you something.

40:06.556 --> 40:10.734
I lost my mom recently, too.

40:10.814 --> 40:14.185
I, er... I know it... it feels, er...

40:15.609 --> 40:20.323
I just wish that there was something
more, you know, that I could have done.

40:24.433 --> 40:26.189
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:26.274 --> 40:29.374
I'm... really sorry.

41:03.217 --> 41:05.127
You're lucky, Mary.

41:42.002 --> 41:43.682
Oh, jeez. Oh!

41:43.766 --> 41:45.718
I thought you heard me.

41:45.799 --> 41:49.749
No. No, I was, erm... somewhere else.

41:53.166 --> 41:56.265
- Cooper OK?
- Erm, yeah.

41:56.350 --> 42:01.752
He passed out early on,
which was probably for the best.

42:04.635 --> 42:08.891
- How you doing?
- Oh, fair to middlin'.

42:13.037 --> 42:14.565
<i>Na zdarovye.</i>

42:21.402 --> 42:24.041
We gotta get the world
back on its feet, Al.

42:24.124 --> 42:27.036
Can't stand warm beer.

42:27.116 --> 42:29.648
The way you took care of him,

42:29.725 --> 42:32.136
you'd do the same for my son, right?

42:32.218 --> 42:36.092
Of course. Why would you ask that?

42:37.475 --> 42:39.766
Never stop being a parent.

42:52.435 --> 42:54.159
Cooper.

42:54.813 --> 42:56.265
Cooper.

42:56.886 --> 42:58.795
My brother wasn't a bad man.

43:00.684 --> 43:03.050
- I just want you to know that.
- Yeah.

43:03.138 --> 43:06.129
Look, we all get that, you know?

43:06.209 --> 43:08.118
I don't care what the others get.

43:10.506 --> 43:11.769
I only care about you.

43:13.765 --> 43:16.176
- Erm...
- Chad...

43:17.716 --> 43:19.746
He looked out for me, you know?

43:20.441 --> 43:21.389
Yeah.

43:21.476 --> 43:23.353
I'm wondering who's gonna do that now.

43:27.577 --> 43:29.529
Er...

43:33.676 --> 43:35.584
Er...

43:49.482 --> 43:54.467
I'm not... in the same head space...

43:55.696 --> 43:57.604
...as you are, you know?

43:58.381 --> 44:01.251
- Yeah, but I could change that.
- No. No.

44:02.371 --> 44:04.978
No. I don't want you to, OK?

44:06.169 --> 44:10.381
I know some really crazy shit
is going down, you know? Heavy stuff...

44:10.466 --> 44:12.571
Ow! Ow!

44:13.227 --> 44:14.601
Ow!

44:14.685 --> 44:16.442
Ow! Ow!

44:26.693 --> 44:28.602
- You OK?
- Yeah.

44:39.852 --> 44:42.919
Hey, anyone else think
that plume of smoke could be their nest?

44:43.609 --> 44:46.327
- Hm-hmm.
- Makes sense they'd have a home base.

44:46.411 --> 44:48.593
Seems like some kind
of a focal point for them.

44:49.902 --> 44:53.383
Sara, please stop
staring at the smoke.

44:53.469 --> 44:56.340
If that plume is the nest,
my mom could be there.

44:56.424 --> 44:58.606
Even if we went,

44:58.688 --> 45:04.667
the chances that we would find your mom
and make it out alive, I mean...

45:04.748 --> 45:07.235
If somebody you loved were there,
you'd go.

45:07.318 --> 45:10.493
Well, someone who loves you
might not want you to go.

45:14.799 --> 45:18.979
After your dad's, I'm not going
to Gibsonton. I'm going to the nest.

45:21.321 --> 45:23.808
Oh!

45:23.891 --> 45:26.760
Just be quiet. They'll pass by.

45:40.310 --> 45:41.762
Go to hell.

45:42.728 --> 45:44.560
What?

45:44.645 --> 45:46.555
All of you can just go to hell.

45:49.825 --> 45:52.193
What are you doing?

45:52.970 --> 45:55.992
- Hey!
- Fuck. Cin... Cindy.

45:56.078 --> 46:00.791
- Here I am! Right here!
- Cindy, please. Cindy.

46:00.873 --> 46:04.626
- Shut your mouth!
- Come and get me!

46:04.710 --> 46:07.165
- Come on.
- Down here! Take me away!

46:07.241 --> 46:09.608
- Oh, God!
- Be quiet.

46:09.697 --> 46:11.836
No! I'm in charge now!

46:11.923 --> 46:13.874
- Here we are! Five of us!
- Cindy.

46:13.955 --> 46:15.983
- God help me if you don't shut up.
- Hold on.

46:16.063 --> 46:18.126
If you don't shut up,
they'll kill all of us.

46:18.212 --> 46:21.432
Good! I want out of this nightmare!

46:22.510 --> 46:24.572
For fuck's sake.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.257
Al...

46:31.449 --> 46:33.979
- She wouldn't shut up.
- Run!

46:46.294 --> 46:47.592
Run!

47:01.564 --> 47:04.050
Oh, shit.

47:04.132 --> 47:06.042
No!

47:20.975 --> 47:23.463
- Don't let go!
- I won't!

48:07.816 --> 48:09.343
Hello?

48:21.817 --> 48:24.077
Yo, Dad?

48:38.735 --> 48:40.645
No sign of him?

48:40.730 --> 48:43.141
No, no. He's, erm...

48:44.911 --> 48:47.781
He's in the den.
He's webbed to his exercise bike.

48:54.349 --> 48:57.567
- Don't you think you should go back...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:57.647 --> 49:00.365
Yeah, I know. I'm... I'm prepping.

49:00.448 --> 49:02.554
I'm working up to it, OK?

49:05.512 --> 49:09.648
We shouldn't be sitting on these.
They're... They're for looks.

49:09.733 --> 49:11.642
Whatever. It's fine.

49:13.339 --> 49:15.248
Lucy!

49:16.446 --> 49:19.087
- Come!
- Dad! Dad!

49:19.171 --> 49:22.695
Dad, what are you doing? I just told you
that they're sensitive to sound.

49:22.776 --> 49:25.186
Oh, well, I'm sorry. Lucy's gone.

49:25.269 --> 49:29.557
OK, I'm sorry, too, alright? I just...
You can't call for her, OK?

49:29.643 --> 49:32.326
- What if that was you out there?
- It's not me any more.

49:32.405 --> 49:36.081
- No, just your little sister.
- Don't call her that. She's a dog.

49:36.164 --> 49:38.696
- She can take care of herself.
- Like hell she can.

49:38.774 --> 49:41.643
She's got a bow in her hair,
for Christ's sake.

49:44.566 --> 49:46.704
You know, I can't believe this happened.

49:46.791 --> 49:50.239
Just when you were beginning
to get your career off the ground.

49:51.317 --> 49:52.343
Yeah.

49:54.079 --> 49:56.033
I'm gonna go make a meal, OK?

49:57.878 --> 49:59.984
I'm sure you're hungry, too.

50:01.100 --> 50:03.131
Do you have any maps inside, Dad?

50:03.211 --> 50:05.010
In my office.

50:05.090 --> 50:08.614
In... I'm allowed? I can unlock it?

50:09.923 --> 50:13.873
Dad, I'm...
I'm sure she's gonna turn up, OK?

50:13.952 --> 50:15.752
Yeah.

50:20.588 --> 50:22.422
Lucy.

50:30.062 --> 50:33.239
Is that local? What are you doing?

50:33.325 --> 50:36.391
I can't read a goddamn thing
without my glasses.

50:36.471 --> 50:39.689
- Maybe I could look at it first.
- Could you wait for eight seconds?

50:47.480 --> 50:50.274
- Hey, how's the food?
- Mm.

50:51.778 --> 50:53.610
Al?

50:53.695 --> 50:55.909
- What?
- How's the food?

50:56.802 --> 50:59.640
Oh, yeah. Good.

51:00.562 --> 51:03.551
Goddamn. I left them in the kitchen.

51:03.631 --> 51:05.083
In the kitchen? Dad, Dad.

51:05.166 --> 51:08.537
Before you go into the kitchen,
can I see the map for a minute, please?

51:08.619 --> 51:12.144
- Without me showing you how? No.
- How to read a map?

51:12.225 --> 51:13.829
Properly, yes.

51:13.913 --> 51:18.167
We're just gonna plot the quickest route
to Gibsonton. That is the original plan?

51:18.247 --> 51:21.728
Well, yeah, the original plan
was that, but now some...

51:21.815 --> 51:25.492
- The objective remains the same.
- There's been unexpected occurrences.

51:25.575 --> 51:29.481
- Cooper, come on.
- Some serious shit has gone down.

51:32.519 --> 51:33.970
Al?

51:37.313 --> 51:40.030
Holy shit. Holy shit. Al?

51:50.280 --> 51:51.502
Al?

51:51.585 --> 51:52.806
Al, Al, Al!

51:54.539 --> 51:57.637
Al! Please, Al, it's Cooper. Let me go.

51:57.722 --> 52:01.172
Hugo's over there.
Hugo's right over there, Al.

52:01.253 --> 52:04.165
- We're all friends.
- Put him down! Put him down!

52:05.702 --> 52:07.840
Al, Al, remember your wife?

52:07.927 --> 52:10.534
- Remember your wife?
- Mary.

52:10.612 --> 52:13.067
Yeah, Mary. That's right.

52:28.259 --> 52:30.168
He told me to.

52:33.131 --> 52:35.694
I think
we should get out of here.

52:35.778 --> 52:38.997
Those gunshots were loud enough to...

52:41.994 --> 52:44.253
No, Dad, Dad!
Don't fire that gun again, OK?

52:44.334 --> 52:46.166
Fine. I'll Tase his ass.

52:56.801 --> 52:59.714
Wow. It's working.

52:59.793 --> 53:02.434
- Die, you bastard. Die.
- It's really working.

53:08.539 --> 53:10.722
- Goddamn it!
- You got that bad.

53:10.805 --> 53:12.942
I'm OK, really. I didn't really get...

53:16.749 --> 53:17.927
Hey, let's move.

53:22.465 --> 53:24.725
Lucy?

53:24.807 --> 53:28.057
It's not Lucy any more, Dad.
What are you doing?

53:28.143 --> 53:31.014
Lucy. Weenie, Lucy. Weenie.

53:31.098 --> 53:33.739
- It's not gonna work, Dad.
- Weenie. See?

53:33.822 --> 53:36.079
Get the Weenie, Lucy.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.342
Gee, Lucy.

53:38.424 --> 53:40.148
Dad! Dad!

53:40.956 --> 53:44.830
Come on! In the shelter!
Come on! Get your butt down there.

53:46.558 --> 53:50.158
That was meant to be decorative.
Come on!

53:50.241 --> 53:53.154
Hugo! Come on!

54:07.197 --> 54:09.564
- OK.
- OK.

54:09.652 --> 54:12.019
- Good night.
- What?

54:12.184 --> 54:16.058
<i>I'm glad your poor mother</i>
<i>isn't alive to hear this.</i>

54:16.136 --> 54:20.085
It's been a month. 
You hear me? Hello?

54:20.163 --> 54:23.306
Jesus Christ!
You could have killed me, lady!

54:23.386 --> 54:25.950
That happens
when you wander blindly into the street.

54:26.033 --> 54:28.792
- Well, I was about to cross.
- Yeah, illegally.

54:28.871 --> 54:31.708
- Illegally. Are you drunk?
- Are you deranged?

54:31.787 --> 54:33.850
God! I am parking.

54:33.936 --> 54:36.543
You can't park in front
of the fire hydrant. You see it?

54:36.620 --> 54:40.725
Wow, nothing gets past you. Alright.
Why don't we just call it even?

54:42.146 --> 54:44.600
People like you, honestly...

54:45.828 --> 54:47.736
Hey, pick a lane!

54:48.704 --> 54:51.115
- Hey.
- You know, you're really...

54:51.198 --> 54:53.413
No, no, no. No, no. Listen, listen.

54:55.111 --> 54:58.986
My number. In case you decide there's
any damage to the front of your vehicle.

54:59.063 --> 55:03.123
Oh, OK. And you just happened
to have it written down?

55:03.207 --> 55:05.695
That's a fantastic question.

55:05.777 --> 55:07.498
No. Mm-mm. No.

55:07.578 --> 55:11.136
I was gonna give it to the girl
that works in my Starbucks.

55:11.223 --> 55:13.983
And I offered it. She said no.

55:14.062 --> 55:17.663
Can I get yours, too,
in case I wanna sue you?

55:18.666 --> 55:20.575
Or ask you to dinner?

55:23.922 --> 55:27.325
How about this... Cooper?

55:27.412 --> 55:31.547
I'll leave it so that I contact you...
if I decide there's damage.

55:32.898 --> 55:34.809
Well, I hope you do.

55:36.122 --> 55:37.418
Cooper!

56:00.749 --> 56:04.307
Huh.
Even in a crisis, you sleep late.

56:04.394 --> 56:06.305
I made some Joe.

56:11.761 --> 56:15.591
You know,
I tried the shortwave this morning.

56:15.673 --> 56:19.426
A few automated distress signals,
but no live broadcast.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.997
I never heard that before.

56:22.079 --> 56:23.803
- What's this?
- Oh, yeah.

56:23.882 --> 56:28.749
Those hearing aids, they got fried.
The bug juice just toasted 'em.

56:29.561 --> 56:32.813
Now, Hugo and I are gonna be ready
to leave in a second.

56:35.047 --> 56:37.337
Put these on ASAP.

56:37.424 --> 56:41.560
Camo? Dad, the...
the bugs are blind, Dad.

56:41.644 --> 56:43.247
If we move at five miles per hour,

56:43.332 --> 56:45.668
we should make it to Gibsonton
by sundown.

56:45.750 --> 56:48.924
I think I should be involved
in the decision making from now on.

56:49.011 --> 56:52.807
Cooper, come on.
You're here. You made it here.

56:52.885 --> 56:54.641
Well done. Bravo.

56:54.727 --> 56:57.595
Now, just drop your ego.
Let me take over.

56:57.680 --> 56:59.709
Drop?

56:59.790 --> 57:02.964
Dad, look,
I was thinking last night, you know.

57:03.051 --> 57:05.889
I was gonna say something.
I should have.

57:06.926 --> 57:10.646
- I think I should go to the nest.
- What?

57:10.723 --> 57:13.670
That girl, Sara, might be there
or might not be there, but...

57:13.754 --> 57:18.162
- You have a plan to go to the nest?
- No, I don't, but... Look, I think...

57:18.242 --> 57:23.186
Dad, I've never done anything in my life
that merits, you know...

57:23.269 --> 57:26.137
I'm selfish. In fact, I'm solipsistic.

57:27.143 --> 57:30.317
That's a real word. Look it up
in the dictionary. It's in there.

57:30.403 --> 57:32.737
- I'm aware it's a word.
- OK, well, then...

57:35.238 --> 57:37.343
Look, I don't expect you to go.

57:38.037 --> 57:41.290
But I really think I should go,
and I don't think I can do it by myself.

57:41.376 --> 57:44.322
- I think I need... I need your help.
- I think it's a crazy idea.

57:44.407 --> 57:47.276
Of course you'd say that.
Of course you'd think it was crazy.

57:47.361 --> 57:50.655
Because, you know, feelings
were never honoured in our home.

57:59.252 --> 58:02.733
Let me tell you a little story.
You're an idiot.

58:02.820 --> 58:04.315
Oh, my God. I'm done.

58:04.394 --> 58:07.306
- Always a pissing contest.
- I've no time for this. I'm done.

58:11.912 --> 58:16.243
Alright. So what do you want?
An apology?

58:16.324 --> 58:19.160
If you did,
then what would that be for, huh?

58:19.239 --> 58:23.680
I have no idea. You and your mother
were always the hypersensitive ones.

58:23.766 --> 58:27.869
- I don't have those needs.
- Mom was not hypersensitive, OK?

58:27.947 --> 58:29.857
See what I mean?

58:29.942 --> 58:35.310
Would it kill you
just to admit for one second

58:35.390 --> 58:38.183
that what I've done so far
isn't terrible?

58:38.267 --> 58:43.439
Cooper, you just don't make
good decisions, alright?

58:43.523 --> 58:47.887
Somewhere along the line,
you did not develop good logic skills.

58:50.621 --> 58:54.145
Are you gonna take this innocent
with you on your suicide mission?

58:55.838 --> 58:56.787
Fuck.

58:56.874 --> 59:00.899
Hugo, you're gonna stay with my dad.

59:01.591 --> 59:04.504
Thank you.
You've saved my life a trillion times.

59:06.425 --> 59:10.026
Goddamn it, Coop! He's following you.

59:11.336 --> 59:15.821
Hugo, stay with my dad, OK?

59:18.394 --> 59:19.616
He's still following.

59:21.194 --> 59:23.453
Hugo, stay with my dad!

59:24.494 --> 59:27.823
- OK?
- Cooper, goddamn it! This is idiocy!

59:53.496 --> 59:56.180
- Unit three to base.
<i>- Go ahead.</i>

59:56.259 --> 01:00:00.164
- I got one, right in front of me.
<i>- We're ready for him. Bring him in.</i>

01:00:00.248 --> 01:00:02.158
Go.

01:00:03.702 --> 01:00:05.349
- Look, brother...
- Move.

01:00:05.428 --> 01:00:10.947
I don't want any trouble, OK? I just...
I gotta be somewhere, OK?

01:00:13.752 --> 01:00:16.240
- Is that right?
- Oh, yeah.

01:00:21.386 --> 01:00:24.637
I can do you right here.
It makes no difference to me.

01:00:24.724 --> 01:00:26.634
Now start walking.

01:00:27.103 --> 01:00:29.011
Get going.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.530
- You guys are cops?
- Basically.

01:00:36.617 --> 01:00:38.754
Basically, what the hell
do you want with me?

01:00:38.841 --> 01:00:40.750
Put you out of your misery, if need be.

01:00:40.835 --> 01:00:44.972
Out of my misery? Would you?
Stop pointing that at me, OK?

01:00:45.056 --> 01:00:46.813
Hey!

01:00:49.352 --> 01:00:51.916
Hey, hey! No one's talking to you.

01:00:56.258 --> 01:00:59.978
Hey, quiet! Look, I'm not gonna have
any plotting on my watch. Is that clear?

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:03.929
Nobody's plotting. Listen, you have to
be stung to become a hybrid, OK?

01:01:04.006 --> 01:01:06.146
They'll swoop down behind you
and get you...

01:01:06.232 --> 01:01:08.262
<i>- Base, this is Jed.</i>
- Go ahead.

01:01:08.342 --> 01:01:10.480
<i>I thought I told you two</i>
<i>to meet me up front.</i>

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:13.633
Yeah, OK.
Well, we had an unexpected arrival.

01:01:35.081 --> 01:01:37.263
- Leechee?
- Leechee. <i>SÍ,</i> Leechee. Leechee.

01:03:13.902 --> 01:03:15.811
Oh!

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:31.467
Get on in there!
And shut the fuck up.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.273
- Move it.
- Separate 'em.

01:03:33.353 --> 01:03:35.960
Put him in with the new fish.
Put him with the Spaniard.

01:03:37.496 --> 01:03:41.784
- You have no idea who I am.
- You're this close to being nobody.

01:03:41.869 --> 01:03:44.280
Back up against the wall. Now!

01:03:46.626 --> 01:03:48.427
Come on. Get in there.

01:03:48.507 --> 01:03:50.458
- Hey.
- Watch it.

01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:53.257
Relax. Hey, listen, listen, are you...

01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:57.628
Are you the one who's in charge here?
I gotta tell you something important.

01:03:57.713 --> 01:04:01.739
There's a really easy way to figure out
who'll become a bug and who won't, OK?

01:04:01.817 --> 01:04:04.655
Listen, it's simple.
You just check the lower back, OK?

01:04:04.733 --> 01:04:06.992
If you've been stung,
it's just right here.

01:04:07.073 --> 01:04:10.476
Just lift up his shirt. And then
we'll all be friends and stop fighting.

01:04:10.564 --> 01:04:12.823
Shut the fuck up! Just shut the fuck up.

01:04:12.905 --> 01:04:14.815
- OK.
- No, no. I think the kid's right.

01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.890
Take me first. These goddamn things
are cutting into my wrists.

01:04:17.970 --> 01:04:20.423
This isn't rocket surgery here. Come on.

01:04:20.500 --> 01:04:23.751
Check us all and then we'll shake hands
and get to the work at hand.

01:04:23.837 --> 01:04:25.747
Shut up.

01:04:27.175 --> 01:04:29.129
- Go ahead.
- Attaboy.

01:04:31.779 --> 01:04:33.273
What the fuck?

01:04:35.846 --> 01:04:38.945
- Daddy.
- I'll snap her neck like a twig.

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.132
- That's my daughter.
- And that's my son.

01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:46.315
Alright, you toss the keys over to him.

01:04:46.395 --> 01:04:47.923
- Baby.
- Nice and easy.

01:04:48.006 --> 01:04:49.578
It's gonna be OK.

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.249
That's my girl. Waste him.

01:04:57.329 --> 01:04:59.009
No, no, no!

01:05:00.014 --> 01:05:01.966
Baby! Baby!

01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:06.612
Oh, fuck.

01:05:13.479 --> 01:05:15.584
Goddamn son of a...

01:05:16.241 --> 01:05:17.419
Don't!

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:28.049
There must be a back door here.

01:05:31.739 --> 01:05:35.067
Well, come on. It's gonna be
bug-a-palooza here in a second.

01:05:38.299 --> 01:05:39.751
- Whoa!
- What?

01:05:39.836 --> 01:05:41.973
- Candy.
- No, no, Dad, we have no time.

01:05:42.059 --> 01:05:44.929
Maybe we do,
if we're gonna go into that nest.

01:05:46.050 --> 01:05:47.272
You wanna do that?

01:05:47.355 --> 01:05:51.489
If what happened to Albert's gonna
happen to me, I wanna go out in style.

01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:57.816
- I don't think there's anything left.
- Yeah, maybe, maybe.

01:05:58.978 --> 01:06:02.152
What are you gonna do,
make a citizen's arrest?

01:06:02.238 --> 01:06:04.147
Let's see.

01:06:05.039 --> 01:06:07.220
Ah.

01:06:07.302 --> 01:06:08.677
Huh?

01:06:12.673 --> 01:06:15.280
- Dad, we gotta go.
- Yeah, I know.

01:06:15.358 --> 01:06:16.351
Well, hello.

01:06:25.217 --> 01:06:27.170
Hey, Dad.

01:06:27.250 --> 01:06:29.968
Let's use these.
It's faster than walking, right?

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:32.385
And just as quiet.

01:06:48.158 --> 01:06:51.879
Hugo and I got about as far
as the end of the street this morning,

01:06:51.956 --> 01:06:55.131
we passed this little dachshund,
all webbed up.

01:06:55.218 --> 01:06:58.055
I couldn't just leave it,
so I unwrapped it.

01:06:58.133 --> 01:07:00.740
Little damn thing
started barking its fool head off.

01:07:00.818 --> 01:07:04.691
I was trying to keep its mouth shut when
I felt something drop down behind me.

01:07:04.769 --> 01:07:08.097
Damn little dog.
It's pretty funny, actually.

01:07:08.183 --> 01:07:10.213
You're enjoying this?

01:07:10.294 --> 01:07:13.589
Yeah, sure. I'm in my element.

01:07:13.669 --> 01:07:15.775
Haven't had this much fun
since Fallujah.

01:07:15.857 --> 01:07:18.148
Fallujah. Am I adopted?

01:07:18.811 --> 01:07:21.570
- Tell me about this game.
- What game?

01:07:21.649 --> 01:07:24.016
The one Maureen was gonna fire you for.

01:07:24.104 --> 01:07:26.437
It's pretty simple, really.

01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.471
You call out to somebody when
their back's turned, you say their name,

01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:34.608
and then, well, when they turn back
around, you pretend like you didn't.

01:07:35.690 --> 01:07:37.064
Huh!

01:07:37.147 --> 01:07:38.981
Dad, it's just fun, OK?

01:07:39.066 --> 01:07:43.396
Yeah, if you're six.
You know, your mother was proud of you.

01:07:43.477 --> 01:07:47.155
No matter how much I argued
about how your life was directionless,

01:07:47.238 --> 01:07:48.611
she was always proud.

01:07:48.695 --> 01:07:52.327
I'd bitch about how you only had done
three semesters at the college,

01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:55.362
but she said you always
had to do things differently.

01:07:55.446 --> 01:07:58.742
She was proud that you made
your own way, followed your own path.

01:07:58.823 --> 01:08:00.316
Oh! Look out!

01:08:02.275 --> 01:08:03.769
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.186 --> 01:08:09.096
Wow.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:20.341
Well, that's certainly gonna
lower property values.

01:08:20.421 --> 01:08:23.562
- What do we once we're in there?
- Find a weak spot.

01:08:23.643 --> 01:08:27.243
- The area that'll hurt 'em the most.
- And Sara.

01:08:27.326 --> 01:08:32.072
Sure, if we can. Then we plant our bomb
and run like hell.

01:09:33.962 --> 01:09:35.380
Oh, God!

01:09:36.225 --> 01:09:38.136
Dad?

01:09:38.911 --> 01:09:40.974
Dad? Dad, what's wrong?

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.392
- I... My stomach.
- You should sit down.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:44.894
- No.
- You gotta sit down.

01:09:44.970 --> 01:09:46.313
What?

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.877
I said... I'm sorry.

01:09:48.961 --> 01:09:50.915
What the fuck are you doing?

01:09:50.996 --> 01:09:53.252
I'd rather have you hate me
than be dead.

01:09:53.335 --> 01:09:56.128
No, no. Dad, no. Dad!

01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:58.046
Hu... Hugo! No!

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:02.693
Hugo! Fuck. Dad!

01:10:02.772 --> 01:10:04.299
- Dad...
- She's gone.

01:10:05.265 --> 01:10:07.405
The chances of Sara being alive
are zero.

01:10:07.491 --> 01:10:09.705
- Dad, you can't do this.
- This is for you.

01:10:09.793 --> 01:10:12.432
No, Dad. I wanna do this, Dad.
You don't understand.

01:10:12.516 --> 01:10:14.502
- The keys.
- Dad...

01:10:14.588 --> 01:10:17.763
You get out of here when Hugo wakes up
and you go away as far as you can.

01:10:17.849 --> 01:10:20.533
- No, Dad!
- I love you.

01:10:20.611 --> 01:10:23.098
Then don't leave me here!

01:10:23.181 --> 01:10:25.167
Dad! Goddamn it.

01:10:25.253 --> 01:10:27.316
Goddamn it!

01:10:27.402 --> 01:10:29.049
Hugo. Damn it.

01:11:48.077 --> 01:11:52.671
It's so dark in here. It's pitch black.
I don't know if we can...

01:12:00.201 --> 01:12:02.110
We're OK. OK.

01:12:02.195 --> 01:12:04.649
Thank you, buddy. Thanks, buddy.

01:12:04.726 --> 01:12:06.636
Thanks.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.556
Oh, hey, hey.

01:12:13.167 --> 01:12:14.661
It works.

01:12:15.968 --> 01:12:19.918
One, two... Oh, wait, wait.
Listen. Hey, listen to me.

01:12:19.996 --> 01:12:23.792
I know you can't hear me, but I need
you to understand something.

01:12:23.869 --> 01:12:28.736
You don't have to go in there,
but I do, OK? You don't have...

01:12:30.161 --> 01:12:32.573
And you're going anyway. That's awesome.

01:12:32.655 --> 01:12:34.760
That's fantastic.
Wait for me. It's dark.

01:12:52.795 --> 01:12:55.206
Oh, God!

01:12:59.854 --> 01:13:02.462
Sara? Sara?

01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:04.568
Uh-huh. Yeah.

01:13:04.649 --> 01:13:07.716
I'm Ethan. Cooper's dad.

01:13:07.796 --> 01:13:10.589
Oh!

01:13:10.673 --> 01:13:13.312
- Oh, my God.
- It's OK. It's OK.

01:13:15.084 --> 01:13:17.222
Here, I got it.

01:13:17.308 --> 01:13:21.412
Oh, thanks. Now, the way I came in
will take you to the outside.

01:13:21.491 --> 01:13:25.288
You take two lefts and a right.
And you be quiet and be quick.

01:13:26.363 --> 01:13:28.775
I can't find my mom.

01:13:33.268 --> 01:13:36.289
I'm sorry, honey.

01:13:36.374 --> 01:13:40.052
I'm sorry. But, please,
you gotta get out of here now.

01:13:40.134 --> 01:13:42.427
- She'd want you to.
- You'll be right behind me?

01:13:42.515 --> 01:13:47.336
No, no. I'm not leaving.
I'm on a one-way ride.

01:13:47.424 --> 01:13:49.715
Well, I'm coming with you, then.

01:13:49.802 --> 01:13:53.631
I've seen the queen.
I can take you to her.

01:13:54.828 --> 01:13:58.231
You know,
I can see why you two get along.

01:14:09.482 --> 01:14:10.628
Hey, if we get Sara...

01:14:10.710 --> 01:14:12.543
Oh! God.

01:14:12.628 --> 01:14:14.842
Back up. Give me some space.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.839
Go that way.

01:14:23.255 --> 01:14:26.014
OK. OK. OK.

01:14:28.549 --> 01:14:29.497
Oh!

01:14:30.966 --> 01:14:34.413
Hugo. Hugo. Hey. Are you OK?

01:14:42.321 --> 01:14:46.499
Holy shit. We gotta get out of here.
We gotta get out of here right now, OK?

01:14:46.578 --> 01:14:49.033
Hey, on your shoulder. Your shoulder!

01:14:49.110 --> 01:14:51.642
They're biting!
They're biting me! They're biting!

01:14:55.939 --> 01:14:58.395
She was here. I swear.

01:14:58.472 --> 01:15:00.839
I believe you.

01:15:00.927 --> 01:15:04.527
Alright, here.
You're gonna be needing those.

01:15:08.292 --> 01:15:11.849
Alright. I want you to get out of here.

01:15:11.937 --> 01:15:14.304
And that's an order. No argument.

01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:25.433
Oh, God. Ethan!

01:15:26.361 --> 01:15:28.193
No!

01:15:28.279 --> 01:15:30.920
Hey, Hugo. Hey, come on!

01:15:40.095 --> 01:15:43.576
No! We can't let her crush the bomb!
Go on! Go get it!

01:15:43.663 --> 01:15:46.227
Come on! Bring it here!

01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:49.561
Damn it.

01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:23.015
- Dad, come on!
- Come on, Ethan.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.466
No, I can't. My legs are fucked.

01:16:25.554 --> 01:16:27.846
- What?
- I'll hold her back.

01:16:33.688 --> 01:16:36.983
- Oh, God.
- Shit. See that?

01:16:37.064 --> 01:16:41.045
Remember to floss.
Now get out of here. Go! Go.

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:43.891
We're not leaving you.
Please!

01:16:47.881 --> 01:16:50.141
I love you, Dad.

01:16:51.449 --> 01:16:53.589
- Son!
- Yeah?

01:16:59.468 --> 01:17:02.763
So that would be a point for me?

01:17:02.843 --> 01:17:04.413
Yeah, it's a fun game.

01:17:07.369 --> 01:17:10.316
- Cooper!
- Go! I'll meet you outside.

01:17:37.408 --> 01:17:39.318
Whoa! Whoa!

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:52.552
OK. OK, OK, OK.

01:17:53.559 --> 01:17:55.434
God!

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.754
Cooper, hurry!

01:18:16.231 --> 01:18:17.495
Get him!

01:18:25.668 --> 01:18:27.698
Run!

01:19:09.977 --> 01:19:13.807
- I had the scariest dream.
- Bugs?

01:19:13.890 --> 01:19:16.180
No. I was eating
pralines and cream ice cream,

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:18.407
but you told me
it was mint chocolate chip.

01:19:18.494 --> 01:19:21.407
You were lying, but it wasn't you,
it was Hugo, Hugo was you.

01:19:21.486 --> 01:19:25.392
You sat down and played this wonderful
Chopin piece on the piano for me,

01:19:25.475 --> 01:19:28.542
but it sounded more like death metal.

01:19:28.621 --> 01:19:30.377
Hmm. Yeah.

01:19:30.462 --> 01:19:35.635
Speaking of hearing things,
we need you to hear something.

01:19:42.930 --> 01:19:44.272
Ow.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.900
No buzzing?

01:19:54.555 --> 01:19:56.464
Nothing's moved for hours.

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:03.106
That's awesome.

01:20:04.952 --> 01:20:06.859
So...

01:20:07.751 --> 01:20:10.238
We're... We're like an item, right?

01:20:12.584 --> 01:20:15.074
I mean, you know,
I just wanna slap a label on it

01:20:15.156 --> 01:20:18.145
before we wake up somebody
far cooler than I am, that's all.

01:20:18.723 --> 01:20:21.090
Is that even possible?

01:20:28.007 --> 01:20:32.218
- So you're my motorcycle girl?
- Yeah, something like that.

01:20:33.416 --> 01:20:34.365
Awesome.

01:20:38.479 --> 01:20:40.160
Look.

01:20:48.147 --> 01:20:50.636
- Whoa.
- Holy shit.
