M_I_SForEver

00:59.101 --> 01:04.140
You little
monsters, can you not hear me?

01:04.173 --> 01:05.473
Are you deaf?

01:09.979 --> 01:10.847
You're not listening to me!

01:10.880 --> 01:11.680
Can't you hear me?

01:11.713 --> 01:13.648
Listen to me, now stop!

01:25.127 --> 01:27.762
Police, open up!

01:27.797 --> 01:28.730
Why are you here?

01:28.763 --> 01:30.765
You're
under arrest for assault

01:30.800 --> 01:31.868
and battery of minors.

01:31.901 --> 01:32.701
- Ma'am.
- I didn't do anything.

01:32.734 --> 01:33.936
Get away from me.

01:33.970 --> 01:34.769
Tell them the truth.

01:34.804 --> 01:36.873
I didn't do anything to you
kids.

01:36.906 --> 01:37.807
You hear me?

01:37.840 --> 01:40.776
I was your last chance, nobody
wants you!

01:40.810 --> 01:42.477
Your family didn't even want
you!

01:42.510 --> 01:43.779
You have the
right to remain silent.

01:43.813 --> 01:46.115
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

01:46.148 --> 01:47.116
in the court of law.

01:47.149 --> 01:47.817
I have
some rights you know!

01:47.850 --> 01:49.484
Don't worry, I'll make sure

01:49.517 --> 01:51.153
you're taken care of, I promise.

02:14.076 --> 02:15.577
Have a good night Kerry.

02:15.610 --> 02:17.780
Oh, Jaylene I got another case
for you.

02:24.253 --> 02:25.988
What's her story?

02:26.022 --> 02:29.524
Mom was killed in a motorcycle
accident two years ago.

02:29.557 --> 02:30.592
The little girl called the cops

02:30.625 --> 02:33.195
when the foster mom went
after the foster brother.

02:34.196 --> 02:35.530
And where is he now?

02:35.563 --> 02:37.632
They found temporary placement
for him.

02:39.634 --> 02:41.037
Her name is Tulsa.

02:41.904 --> 02:44.941
You need to find a replacement
before you leave tonight.

02:44.974 --> 02:47.243
Kerry, you know that's
impossible.

02:47.276 --> 02:48.778
I mean, all of our beds are
full.

02:48.811 --> 02:51.047
Try Michelle at the Atlanta
Mission.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.848
Sometimes she's willing to
foster kids

02:52.882 --> 02:54.951
for short term emergencies.

02:54.984 --> 02:56.651
The sooner you find her
placement,

02:56.685 --> 02:58.586
the sooner you can start your
weekend.

03:02.158 --> 03:02.959
Have a good night Kerry.

03:02.992 --> 03:04.060
See you Monday.

03:09.231 --> 03:11.867
Tulsa hi, I'm Ms. Jaylene.

03:11.901 --> 03:13.235
I'm gonna be your caseworker.

03:16.238 --> 03:17.173
How's Michael?

03:17.907 --> 03:20.876
He is staying with
relatives in South Georgia

03:20.910 --> 03:22.211
for now anyway.

03:22.244 --> 03:24.981
They should know he's scared
of the dark

03:25.014 --> 03:27.049
and sometimes he wets his bed

03:27.083 --> 03:29.885
but if you read to him,
it'll calm him down.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.854
You two got pretty close
didn't you?

03:32.487 --> 03:34.556
I know Jesus will take care of
him.

03:38.327 --> 03:40.930
Do you believe in Jesus Ms.
Jaylene?

03:42.764 --> 03:43.933
Yes I do.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.702
You know, you are pretty
mature for a nine year old.

03:48.838 --> 03:52.540
Well Tulsa, it is my job to
find you a safe place to stay.

03:52.574 --> 03:53.943
Oh, you don't have to.

03:53.976 --> 03:55.845
I'm going to stay with my
father.

03:55.878 --> 03:57.645
- Your father?
- Mmh mmh.

03:58.546 --> 04:02.918
I don't seem to have any
information on your father.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.287
Do you know where you lives or
his name?

04:06.956 --> 04:08.858
Have you ever met him before?

04:08.891 --> 04:12.061
No, but I found his picture
of him in my mama's Bible.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.901
That's mama and that's my
father.

04:22.004 --> 04:23.738
Is your father's name Tommy?

04:28.844 --> 04:31.113
All right boss, we're out of
here.

04:31.147 --> 04:32.314
We'll see you on Monday.

04:34.183 --> 04:35.251
Hey Tommy, you good?

04:42.757 --> 04:43.725

06:53.322 --> 06:56.091
Tommy hi, it's Jaylene.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.760
I'm sorry I know it's late
but we need to meet up.

07:00.362 --> 07:01.830
Now is not a good time.

07:03.899 --> 07:05.067
I have your daughter.

07:16.545 --> 07:18.514
You said I have a daughter?

07:18.547 --> 07:20.916
I'm fine by the way,
thank you for asking.

07:22.785 --> 07:24.520
And yes like I told you,

07:24.553 --> 07:27.256
this little girl claims
you're her biological father.

07:29.425 --> 07:33.929
The only proof she has is this
photo.

07:36.165 --> 07:38.067
She doesn't even know your name.

07:38.100 --> 07:38.934
Sandy?

07:40.002 --> 07:41.470
What happened to her?

07:41.503 --> 07:43.172
A motorcycle accident two
years ago.

07:43.205 --> 07:44.306
You didn't know that?

07:44.340 --> 07:45.174
No.

07:47.409 --> 07:52.414
Wow, we had some crazy times.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.383
Yeah, I know.

07:58.887 --> 08:01.257
She wrote to me for a couple
months after I deployed,

08:01.290 --> 08:04.893
but that was like 10 years ago.

08:06.128 --> 08:07.129
Tulsa is nine

08:08.831 --> 08:09.531
Tulsa?

08:12.034 --> 08:13.535
She has no other family.

08:14.436 --> 08:17.373
Her most recent placement
was a really bad situation.

08:22.478 --> 08:24.580
So what do you want me to do?

08:24.613 --> 08:28.117
I'm not saying you're her
father, but if you're willing,

08:28.150 --> 08:30.052
we can do some tests to confirm
that.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.023
As for right now, she just
really wants to meet you.

08:36.091 --> 08:36.991
Then what?

08:38.394 --> 08:39.561
I don't even like kids.

08:41.063 --> 08:43.565
I am in no position to be a
father.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.036
Then just be her friend.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.345
So, that's Tulsa.

08:58.047 --> 09:00.416
- What's she doing?
- Praying.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.519
- For what?
- Probably for you.

09:07.189 --> 09:08.023
Come on.

09:15.264 --> 09:17.032
Are you all right?

09:18.033 --> 09:19.368
Be careful next time okay?

09:22.905 --> 09:26.041
Tulsa sweetie,
this is Tommy Colston.

09:26.975 --> 09:28.344
My father!

09:28.377 --> 09:29.878
Tommy wanted to meet you.

09:31.080 --> 09:31.980
Yeah.

09:34.383 --> 09:37.986
You look different than
your picture, you're scrappy.

09:39.688 --> 09:42.958
Tulsa sweetie, Tommy has
agreed to do some tests

09:42.991 --> 09:44.593
to see if he's your father.

09:44.626 --> 09:47.162
He doesn't have to, he is.

09:47.863 --> 09:50.199
It's time for me to go home now.

09:50.232 --> 09:55.237
Look kid, I wouldn't be good
for you right now, trust me.

09:56.705 --> 10:00.209
It sounds like we've
got a lot of work to do.

10:00.242 --> 10:01.410
I'll get my things.

10:02.311 --> 10:03.545
What's happening?

10:03.579 --> 10:06.115
Let's just take her to
your place and show her.

10:12.087 --> 10:14.456
So this is my garage.

10:22.131 --> 10:23.132
It's filthy.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.134
It's a garage.

10:27.436 --> 10:29.238
You own this place?

10:29.271 --> 10:31.507
No, I rent this place.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.275
I live in the apartment
upstairs.

10:36.612 --> 10:37.546
Is this it?

10:38.514 --> 10:42.117
Hey, kid wait!

10:57.566 --> 11:00.068
I wasn't expecting company.

11:01.236 --> 11:02.137
Forever?

11:04.540 --> 11:06.642
Okay, I'll stay.

11:08.076 --> 11:10.379
She can't, I mean you
wouldn't?

11:11.713 --> 11:14.216
Tulsa sweetie, it's not that
simple.

11:15.785 --> 11:16.618
No.

11:17.352 --> 11:19.154
You don't have a place for me
to stay,

11:19.188 --> 11:21.557
but it's okay now, I found my
father.

11:22.524 --> 11:26.061
Sweetie, it's much
more involved than that.

11:26.094 --> 11:28.564
That's right, yeah, tell her.

11:29.465 --> 11:31.767
I mean, there needs to be
meetings,

11:31.801 --> 11:35.137
interviews, background checks.

11:35.170 --> 11:37.539
And I'll definitely
fail those, all of them.

11:37.573 --> 11:42.177
I mean, this place needs to
be cleaned up and inspected.

11:43.212 --> 11:44.379
We'll be ready.

11:44.413 --> 11:46.048
Don't worry, we'll fix you.

11:48.183 --> 11:49.451
Is my room down there?

11:50.820 --> 11:51.653
Don't!

11:53.589 --> 11:55.190
You can't just leave her here.

12:00.596 --> 12:04.032
She's right, we don't have
any place for her to stay.

12:06.635 --> 12:10.105
Just for a little while
until I figure this out.

12:10.138 --> 12:13.175
I know you, you'll take great
care of her.

12:13.208 --> 12:15.110
Are you serious?

12:15.143 --> 12:16.178
What do I do with her?

12:16.211 --> 12:21.149
The Tommy Colston I know
is a charmer, charm her.

12:23.786 --> 12:24.720
Charm her?

12:29.625 --> 12:31.226
You left her with him?

12:31.260 --> 12:33.462
There was nowhere else for her
to go.

12:33.495 --> 12:35.063
Besides, he's her father.

12:35.097 --> 12:37.432
You don't know that for sure.

12:37.466 --> 12:40.302
A non emergency DNA test
takes six to eight weeks,

12:40.335 --> 12:41.703
maybe even longer.

12:41.737 --> 12:44.139
There's not even anyone
who can vouch for this man.

12:44.172 --> 12:45.340
I know Tommy.

12:45.374 --> 12:48.210
I will vouch for him and I
will constantly check on them.

12:48.243 --> 12:50.445
If anything happens to this
child,

12:50.479 --> 12:52.748
it's your license on the line or
worse.

12:53.448 --> 12:56.685
Jaylene, Jaylene did you hear
me?

12:56.718 --> 12:58.487
Yes, I hear you

13:12.334 --> 13:13.836
I'm all unpacked!

13:16.204 --> 13:17.105
Great.

13:20.142 --> 13:22.177
Where you in the Army?

13:22.210 --> 13:23.278
The Marines.

13:24.713 --> 13:26.415
What's the difference?

13:26.448 --> 13:27.716
How much time do we have?

13:30.385 --> 13:32.889
You know, you shouldn't smoke
or drink?

13:32.922 --> 13:34.323
It'll kill you.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.139
So will children.

13:52.774 --> 13:55.143
Can I ask you some questions?

13:55.812 --> 13:56.879
Do I have a choice?

14:14.329 --> 14:15.364
Are you a criminal?

14:16.899 --> 14:18.233
No.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.568
What's your favorite color?

14:19.601 --> 14:20.268
Black.

14:20.302 --> 14:21.570
What's your favorite movie?

14:21.603 --> 14:22.872
"Black bear".

14:22.905 --> 14:24.640
What do you do for fun?

14:24.673 --> 14:25.875
Yoga.

14:25.908 --> 14:28.577
Do you have a girlfriend?

14:28.610 --> 14:29.779
Nope.

14:29.812 --> 14:31.546
Do you want one?

14:31.580 --> 14:32.447
Nope.

14:35.684 --> 14:38.487
If you weren't a
mechanic, what would you be?

14:38.520 --> 14:39.688
Life coach.

14:44.927 --> 14:48.664
You know, you're a little
Didi you know that?

14:48.697 --> 14:50.198
What's a Didi?

14:56.005 --> 14:57.606
So what you got there?

14:59.541 --> 15:04.546
Ooh, I get it, that's yours,
that's cool.

15:06.816 --> 15:08.785
It's mama's Bible.

15:08.818 --> 15:12.554
All the answers you'll ever
need in life are in this book.

15:16.859 --> 15:18.326
Did you love my mama?

15:20.262 --> 15:20.963
Yeah.

15:21.663 --> 15:25.400
Me and your mom had a lot of
fun.

15:28.637 --> 15:33.241
She called those her wild
days before she found Jesus.

15:37.046 --> 15:38.647
I didn't know He was missing.

15:39.816 --> 15:41.951
Everybody needs Jesus.

15:41.984 --> 15:43.251
He's needed here.

15:44.753 --> 15:47.322
Yeah, well, it's getting
a little too crowded in here

15:47.355 --> 15:48.423
if you asked me.

15:52.862 --> 15:55.031
Well, I'm going back to bed.

15:55.064 --> 15:57.265
You think you can find something
to do?

15:59.068 --> 16:03.271
Wake me up only if the place
catches fire

16:04.773 --> 16:09.779
and do not touch anything,
anything.

16:50.352 --> 16:51.319
What are you doing?

16:52.420 --> 16:53.990
Getting ready for the
inspection.

17:05.599 --> 17:07.103
They're all gone.

17:07.136 --> 17:08.403
What's gone?

17:08.435 --> 17:10.472
All your alcohol and
cigarettes.

17:10.505 --> 17:11.339
I threw them out.

17:11.373 --> 17:12.440
What the hell?

17:13.407 --> 17:16.578
Language, you should
have your mouth washed out

17:16.611 --> 17:17.546
with soap for that.

17:18.445 --> 17:19.513
Whisky's stronger.

17:20.615 --> 17:21.818
Look little Didi.

17:21.851 --> 17:23.652
My name is Tulsa.

17:23.685 --> 17:24.486
I don't care.

17:24.519 --> 17:26.055
I told you to stay out of my
stuff.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.757
It's time to get clean and
organized.

17:29.391 --> 17:31.359
Are you gonna help or not?

17:56.651 --> 17:58.386
What are you doing now?

17:58.420 --> 17:59.856
Laundry.

17:59.889 --> 18:01.756
What do you know about
laundry?

18:01.791 --> 18:03.893
As much as you know
about being a parent.

18:12.201 --> 18:15.604
I told you, I got rid of all
your alcohol,

18:15.637 --> 18:17.439
including everything you hid.

18:18.207 --> 18:19.876
I gotta go.

18:19.909 --> 18:21.643
You don't need that stuff!

18:46.601 --> 18:48.570
- Hey Jaylene.
- Hey Tommy,

18:48.603 --> 18:49.638
how's Tulsa doing?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.640
She's upstairs probably
sprinkling Holy water

18:51.673 --> 18:52.641
all over the place.

18:53.608 --> 18:55.577
She's trying to make a home.

18:55.610 --> 18:57.512
Can't she stay with you?

18:57.545 --> 18:59.447
Unfortunately no, she can't.

18:59.481 --> 19:01.683
Besides, I believe every
girl needs a father.

19:02.417 --> 19:03.920
Call me if you need anything
tonight,

19:03.953 --> 19:05.553
I'll check in on you tomorrow.

19:09.091 --> 19:12.627
Tommy, Tommy?

19:12.661 --> 19:14.596
Yeah

19:14.629 --> 19:16.966
I know this must be a
shock, but you got this.

19:18.566 --> 19:19.201
Yeah.

19:34.116 --> 19:37.619
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

19:37.652 --> 19:40.890
He makes me lie down
in the green pastures.

19:41.623 --> 19:44.894
He leads me beside the still
waters.

19:44.927 --> 19:46.796
He restores my soul.

19:46.829 --> 19:48.898
He leads me in the paths

19:48.931 --> 19:52.902
of righteousness through His
namesake.

19:52.935 --> 19:56.571
Yea, though I walk through the
valley

19:56.604 --> 19:58.773
of the shadow of death.

20:04.013 --> 20:05.114
Are you okay?

20:06.182 --> 20:09.517
Yeah, I'm awesome.

20:22.697 --> 20:26.936
♪ Amazing grace how sweet the
sound ♪

20:33.342 --> 20:37.279
♪ That saved a wretch like you ♪

20:43.718 --> 20:45.021
Quiet!

20:45.054 --> 20:46.822
It's time for church.

20:48.357 --> 20:50.725
There are no churches in this
town.

20:50.759 --> 20:52.862
You're lying, now get up.

20:52.895 --> 20:54.696
I made breakfast.

20:54.729 --> 20:56.731
I'm not going to know any
church.

20:56.765 --> 20:59.235
And take a shower, you stink!

21:01.003 --> 21:02.704
You stink.

21:02.737 --> 21:03.906
And shave that scruff.

21:06.208 --> 21:08.310
I'm gonna drop you off at the
orphanage.

21:20.688 --> 21:25.693
So, from now on I do the
laundry.

21:39.942 --> 21:41.609
I told you I got rid of them.

21:46.182 --> 21:47.183
Of course.

22:06.435 --> 22:09.839
Since you're not going to
church,

22:11.739 --> 22:13.242
I made a list of chores for you.

22:15.144 --> 22:16.879
You can start by mowing the
grass.

22:21.383 --> 22:25.287
I may have saved one pack of
cigarettes.

22:25.321 --> 22:28.756
If you mow the grass, I'll
tell you where I hid them.

22:31.093 --> 22:35.898
I'm not playing your
little games understand?

22:47.009 --> 22:49.011
Come on, there's still some
left.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.915
Gimme me my cigarettes.

22:52.948 --> 22:56.185
This and that.

22:59.321 --> 23:00.990
What?

23:01.023 --> 23:02.958
No, just give me my cigarettes.

23:08.330 --> 23:10.732
You'll get the rest once you
do that.

23:12.935 --> 23:14.303
Don't forget to do this part.

23:17.806 --> 23:19.275
Hold on, I'll give you a ride.

23:27.816 --> 23:29.717
- Hop on.
- No.

23:29.751 --> 23:30.718
What's wrong now?

23:30.752 --> 23:32.955
It's not safe, you're
not wearing a helmet.

23:32.988 --> 23:35.024
You even know where you're
going?

23:35.057 --> 23:36.292
God will lead me.

23:36.325 --> 23:37.326
God will lead you.

23:39.528 --> 23:42.031
You can't just walk in
there, it's not your church.

23:42.064 --> 23:45.134
That's the cool thing about
church, it's for everyone.

23:45.167 --> 23:46.435
Come on, you'll see.

23:46.468 --> 23:47.536
No thanks.

23:47.570 --> 23:50.239
Hey, I'll meet you out front
after the service, okay?

23:59.481 --> 24:01.050
How's Tulsa this morning?

24:01.083 --> 24:02.318
Oh, she's great.

24:02.351 --> 24:05.221
She's just giving Jesus honor.

24:05.254 --> 24:08.524
Jaylene, I don't know how
much longer I can do this.

24:08.557 --> 24:13.395
She is the most stubborn,
arrogant, hardheaded,

24:14.096 --> 24:17.299
know it all I've never met.

24:17.333 --> 24:19.301
It sounds like someone else I
know.

24:19.335 --> 24:20.903
That reminds me, we need to
register her

24:20.936 --> 24:22.137
for school tomorrow.

24:22.171 --> 24:24.540
Wait, does that mean she's
staying?

24:24.573 --> 24:26.075
Just for the time being.

24:26.108 --> 24:27.343
Try to make the best of it.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.394
Goodbye Tulsa.

24:45.427 --> 24:46.962
You keep praising the Lord.

24:48.030 --> 24:48.897
Tommy!

24:51.300 --> 24:54.203
My dear, you were a gift

24:54.236 --> 24:56.038
from my heavenly Father this
morning.

24:56.071 --> 24:57.539
Thank you Bishop Franklin.

24:58.207 --> 25:01.043
Are you the father of
this wonderful little girl?

25:01.076 --> 25:02.378
That's what they tell me.

25:03.212 --> 25:05.547
Well sir, you have a little
angel here.

25:07.383 --> 25:09.385
Yep, my little angel.

25:11.553 --> 25:12.988
I hope to see you again.

25:19.328 --> 25:24.033
Not so fast, get on.

25:24.066 --> 25:27.303
I told you it's not safe.

25:27.336 --> 25:28.237
Trust me.

25:36.045 --> 25:36.945
Ta-dah!

25:43.085 --> 25:44.286
Put your bible.

25:47.256 --> 25:48.857
All right, throw it up here.

25:59.101 --> 26:01.937

27:23.752 --> 27:25.354
Can I ask you a question?

27:26.755 --> 27:28.290
More questions?

27:30.125 --> 27:31.393
Go ahead, shoot.

27:33.395 --> 27:36.031
Why are you so scared to go to
church?

27:36.064 --> 27:37.366
Are you like Godphobic?

27:38.367 --> 27:40.035
Godphobic?

27:40.068 --> 27:41.170
Is that a thing?

27:41.203 --> 27:42.638
It seems like your thing.

27:43.439 --> 27:46.708
Listen Didi, I'm not scared of
anything.

27:48.143 --> 27:49.678
I just know it doesn't work.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.380
How do you know?

27:51.413 --> 27:52.314
I just know.

27:52.981 --> 27:56.151
Maybe God's at work right
now and you just don't see it.

27:57.586 --> 28:01.490
Okay, can I ask you a
question?

28:03.158 --> 28:04.593
Go ahead, shoot.

28:06.195 --> 28:07.196
That foster mom,

28:08.497 --> 28:09.398
did she hurt you?

28:11.667 --> 28:14.002
It's okay if you don't
wanna talk about it.

28:15.270 --> 28:20.108
Michael, he's my foster
brother.

28:22.411 --> 28:24.746
He had an accident in the bed
that night.

28:26.648 --> 28:29.184
We tried to wash the sheets
before she found out,

28:33.222 --> 28:34.223
but she caught me.

28:37.426 --> 28:38.694
You did the right thing.

28:41.530 --> 28:44.533
This Michael, he means a lot to
you?

28:45.835 --> 28:47.769
He's very special to me.

28:54.209 --> 28:55.244
You want some more?

28:59.281 --> 29:00.549
Maybe we should go home.

29:01.851 --> 29:02.684
Good idea.

29:15.865 --> 29:16.732
Let me help.

29:27.743 --> 29:28.577
There!

29:31.513 --> 29:33.081
It's a really sad painting.

29:37.586 --> 29:40.122
You should go to bed,
you have school tomorrow.

29:45.527 --> 29:46.528
Who's Lisa?

29:49.665 --> 29:52.200
I said go to bed.

29:54.136 --> 29:58.206
Look, you wanted a dad,
well I'm being a dad, go!

30:18.460 --> 30:21.330
Listen, if anyone comes in, get
payment.

30:22.031 --> 30:25.534
I'm bleeding here and now with
Tulsa.

30:25.567 --> 30:27.202
Someone shows up, says you're
a daddy

30:27.235 --> 30:28.637
and you believe 'em?

30:30.639 --> 30:31.773
I mean, I'd want proof.

30:32.507 --> 30:34.409
Yeah well, they're doing
tests.

30:35.477 --> 30:37.746
How long have you known Tommy?

30:37.780 --> 30:39.481
My entire life.

30:40.883 --> 30:41.818
How old are you?

30:42.885 --> 30:43.719
35.

30:47.656 --> 30:48.490
ID.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.170
You ever done time?

31:03.505 --> 31:04.907
I'd rather not talk about it.

31:07.275 --> 31:08.276
Who's the lady?

31:10.412 --> 31:12.280
She's my sister.

31:13.515 --> 31:14.416
What's her name?

31:16.451 --> 31:17.352
Trixy.

31:19.755 --> 31:23.492
Well, if you are a nice
brother,

31:23.525 --> 31:28.463
you'd buy Trixy some clothes.

31:30.867 --> 31:32.601
Come on Tulsa, time for
school.

31:34.003 --> 31:36.204
We'll continue this later.

31:41.811 --> 31:43.245
Man, who is that kid?

31:48.818 --> 31:49.718
What's wrong?

31:52.955 --> 31:55.624
It's just, do I have to go?

32:01.630 --> 32:03.398
Well, if it were up to me, I'd
teach you

32:03.432 --> 32:06.401
how to rebuild a carburetor
and I'd put your butt to work.

32:10.873 --> 32:11.740
What now?

32:14.476 --> 32:17.245
I've been in five different
schools since mama died.

32:18.447 --> 32:20.348
The girls can be kind of mean.

32:21.750 --> 32:24.553
Mean like, mean how?

32:24.586 --> 32:25.654
Like they beat you up?

32:26.989 --> 32:29.257
Yes, but with their words.

32:31.660 --> 32:32.829
Well, you may not wanna tell
everyone

32:32.862 --> 32:34.897
at the lunch table they're going
to hell.

32:35.898 --> 32:37.766
Save that for your second day.

32:40.602 --> 32:45.607
Okay, look kid you gotta
treat school like prison.

32:47.476 --> 32:50.679
Go up to the biggest, baddest
girl

32:50.712 --> 32:52.280
and punch her in the face.

32:53.548 --> 32:56.284
Okay no, not really.

32:58.788 --> 33:02.925
But, yes punch her in the face.

33:02.959 --> 33:04.392
It's all in the attitude.

33:06.394 --> 33:07.629
You know I got an idea.

33:07.662 --> 33:10.699
We've got to make a quick stop
before we go to school, okay?

33:12.869 --> 33:15.704
I do have other
appointments Ms. Sanders.

33:15.737 --> 33:17.372
Mr. Colston's a new father.

33:17.405 --> 33:18.941
I'm sure he just wants to
make sure everything's okay

33:18.975 --> 33:20.475
for Tulsa's first day.

33:41.130 --> 33:44.499
Principal Workman, this is
Tommy Colston and Tulsa.

33:44.533 --> 33:46.936
- What's up?
- What's up?

33:48.670 --> 33:51.339
- I mean good morning.
- Good morning.

33:51.373 --> 33:52.975
Well, let's go ahead and get
started.

33:53.009 --> 33:54.709
Tulsa, this is Riley.

33:54.743 --> 33:56.813
You'll be shadowing her on your
first day.

33:56.846 --> 33:59.048
Hi Tulsa, I like your jacket.

33:59.081 --> 33:59.916
Thanks.

34:16.098 --> 34:17.364
She's gonna be okay right?

34:17.399 --> 34:18.835
She will.

34:18.868 --> 34:20.735
You're doing fine Tommy.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.670
Establish a routine, pick her up
everyday

34:22.704 --> 34:25.074
at the same time, help
her with her homework.

34:25.107 --> 34:27.143
Foster kids like her are
really sensitive to anything

34:27.176 --> 34:29.045
that triggers feelings of
abandonment.

34:31.179 --> 34:33.380
I clearly don't know what I'm
doing.

34:34.784 --> 34:36.052
I gotta get this, one second.

34:47.629 --> 34:48.630
I can't believe it!

34:48.663 --> 34:50.166
By the way, did you
guys see that new girl

34:50.199 --> 34:51.132
in the leather jacket?

34:51.167 --> 34:53.168
I hope she doesn't
get grease all over us.

34:53.202 --> 34:54.170
I know right?

34:54.203 --> 34:57.639
Hi girls.

34:57.672 --> 34:59.441
You better watch what you say.

35:00.810 --> 35:03.411
That little grease monkey is my
daughter

35:03.445 --> 35:05.714
and the last three little brats

35:05.747 --> 35:09.819
who teased her mysteriously
disappeared.

35:10.752 --> 35:11.787
I know right?

35:11.821 --> 35:16.826
Like they disappeared,
disappeared.

35:19.594 --> 35:20.662
Psychopath!

35:22.064 --> 35:23.165
It's nice that you're
defending Tulsa,

35:23.199 --> 35:26.202
but let's try not to threaten
any more minors okay?

35:26.235 --> 35:27.069
It was just a pep talk.

35:38.180 --> 35:39.015
Tulsa!

35:56.198 --> 35:57.066
Forgotten.

35:58.267 --> 36:01.770
Oh, it's so sad when that
happens.

36:01.804 --> 36:03.239
My ride is just late.

36:03.272 --> 36:05.174
Maybe your dad got arrested.

36:05.207 --> 36:08.010
Yeah, he's probably in jail.

36:08.044 --> 36:10.046
I'll tell him to say hi to
your mom.

36:10.913 --> 36:14.083
Oh, I got the cutest dress
for the daddy, daughter dance.

36:14.116 --> 36:15.985
We're going shopping this
weekend.

36:17.652 --> 36:19.855
Are you and your dad going?

36:19.889 --> 36:23.658
Of course not, her dad can't
even remember to pick her up.

36:35.237 --> 36:37.672
Tulsa, Tulsa, Tulsa wait up!

36:43.846 --> 36:45.281
I'm sorry, I was working.

36:45.314 --> 36:46.748
Time just got away from me.

36:49.318 --> 36:50.152
Just say it.

36:52.021 --> 36:52.922
Say what?

36:53.588 --> 36:55.791
That I don't mean anything to
you.

36:56.758 --> 36:57.827
That's not true.

36:57.860 --> 36:59.561
Then why didn't you look for
me?

37:00.930 --> 37:02.231
Look for you?

37:02.264 --> 37:03.598
I knew you'd be here.

37:03.631 --> 37:06.534
Not here, when I was born.

37:08.104 --> 37:09.905
I didn't even know you
existed.

37:09.939 --> 37:11.673
You didn't want to know.

37:11.706 --> 37:16.012
Fathers are supposed to be
there always, no matter what.

37:16.045 --> 37:17.313
They're supposed to protect
their kids,

37:17.346 --> 37:19.782
play with them, teach them
things.

37:19.815 --> 37:21.683
I can't even ride a bike.

37:21.716 --> 37:22.885
Hold up.

37:22.918 --> 37:25.187
I had this stupid dream
that I knew you would love me

37:25.221 --> 37:26.721
and take care of me.

37:28.590 --> 37:29.892
I feel so stupid.

37:30.926 --> 37:34.629
Just go and ask Ms. Jaylene
to take you somewhere else.

37:34.662 --> 37:36.265
What?

37:36.298 --> 37:39.768
I know I'm a lot to handle and
a pain.

37:40.668 --> 37:41.303
I get it.

37:42.972 --> 37:44.073
Just tell me the truth.

37:46.741 --> 37:50.146
No, I want you to stay.

37:53.249 --> 37:56.318
I'm sorry kid, it's my fault.

37:59.321 --> 38:02.958
I'll do better, I promise.

38:02.992 --> 38:03.993
That's easy to say.

38:05.928 --> 38:08.097
You never got a chance
to be a kid did you?

38:10.399 --> 38:12.001
We're gonna take care of that.

38:20.009 --> 38:21.177
So how was school?

38:21.210 --> 38:22.644
You knock out any bullies?

38:25.114 --> 38:26.614
Arg, school is overrated.

38:28.117 --> 38:29.218
You know what they say?

38:30.186 --> 38:31.619
C's get degrees.

38:32.620 --> 38:36.292
Ms. Jaylene went a
different way with her advice.

38:37.193 --> 38:38.760
What's that?

38:38.794 --> 38:40.963
Some daddy, daughter
dance at your school.

38:42.131 --> 38:42.965
What do you say?

38:43.866 --> 38:45.835
You and me, let's go.

38:47.970 --> 38:51.006
Mama says dancing leads to
fornication.

38:51.040 --> 38:52.074
Fornication?

38:53.275 --> 38:54.877
Do you even know what that
means?

38:58.314 --> 39:00.748
Okay no, but I know it's bad.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.751
Well, not all dancing is bad
Didi.

39:04.820 --> 39:06.155
You gotta have a little fun.

39:08.756 --> 39:10.059
No I'm not going.

39:10.092 --> 39:12.228
And why do you keep calling me
Didi?

39:14.396 --> 39:15.663
You can't dance.

39:17.466 --> 39:19.869
That's it, you can't dance.

39:22.004 --> 39:24.039
Listen, I'll teach you.

39:24.073 --> 39:28.144
You will be the coolest kid
on the dance floor, I promise.

39:28.177 --> 39:29.011
Come on.

39:30.412 --> 39:33.849
We still have a lot to
do before the inspection.

39:33.883 --> 39:34.884
We should hurry.

39:37.186 --> 39:42.191
Yes ma'am, but just remember
the rhythm is gonna get you.

39:44.026 --> 39:48.864
No, seriously, it is going to
get you.

40:00.809 --> 40:04.046
Tommy, what's the capital of
Alaska?

40:07.216 --> 40:08.284
What?

40:08.317 --> 40:10.186
The capital of Alaska?

40:10.219 --> 40:11.887
I need to know for homework.

40:17.459 --> 40:18.827
Let me think.

40:26.835 --> 40:27.735
You okay?

40:48.857 --> 40:50.326
Give me a second.

41:22.591 --> 41:23.792
Yeah, I'm okay kid.

41:26.295 --> 41:27.129
I'm clean.

41:28.530 --> 41:32.968
So you say Jesus, He's always
with us?

41:34.603 --> 41:35.471
Yeah.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.309
So is He here with this now?

41:41.977 --> 41:42.811
Right.

41:45.314 --> 41:47.983
Like right here?

41:49.218 --> 41:50.552
No, right here.

41:53.455 --> 41:54.957
Wow.

41:54.990 --> 41:57.526
- Colston.
- Mr. Garcia.

41:57.559 --> 42:00.062
Mr. Garcia?

42:00.095 --> 42:01.530
I thought you forgot about all
my name.

42:01.563 --> 42:03.599
I mean, I haven't received any
rent check

42:03.632 --> 42:04.833
in the last three months.

42:04.867 --> 42:05.968
What's up with that?

42:06.001 --> 42:07.136
You'll get your rent.

42:07.169 --> 42:08.237
I just need a little time to
collect

42:08.270 --> 42:10.239
on some invoices that's it.

42:10.272 --> 42:11.907
Who's that?

42:11.940 --> 42:12.841
That's my kid.

42:13.809 --> 42:16.545
- Tiny, can you?
- Tulsa, let's take a break

42:16.578 --> 42:17.413
and go out back.

42:21.350 --> 42:25.321
Listen, you have until
the end of the month

42:25.354 --> 42:28.190
or you're out that's it, okay?

42:30.125 --> 42:31.393
You'll get your rent.

42:31.427 --> 42:32.461
You better!

42:36.532 --> 42:39.435
Hey, watch what you're
doing.

42:42.671 --> 42:46.909
Tiny, when's the last
time you washed your hands.

42:48.377 --> 42:49.278
What's today?

42:51.613 --> 42:52.514
Last week.

44:05.687 --> 44:07.689
Tommy, dinner's ready!

44:14.163 --> 44:15.364
Dinner's ready!

44:22.371 --> 44:23.238
Tommy?

44:24.473 --> 44:26.608
Tommy wake up, wake up!

44:30.179 --> 44:31.480
I'm sorry Lisa

44:32.714 --> 44:34.383
It's me Tulsa!

44:34.416 --> 44:35.484
Tommy, wake up!

44:43.158 --> 44:45.027
You've got to beat this Tommy.

44:45.795 --> 44:47.162
You were doing so good.

44:50.399 --> 44:51.400
I'm sorry.

44:53.635 --> 44:55.204
Promise me you'll get help.

44:56.505 --> 44:58.273
I don't wanna lose you Tommy.

44:59.608 --> 45:04.613
I'm not gonna lose you either.

45:16.358 --> 45:17.526
I didn't deserve that.

45:19.595 --> 45:21.296
No, no you didn't,

45:26.435 --> 45:28.537
but it's what you needed.

45:41.550 --> 45:44.653
Tommy Colston, good to
see you again young man.

45:45.855 --> 45:46.722
Bishop.

45:49.859 --> 45:52.160
What's a little grease
among friends.

45:54.296 --> 45:55.464
Hey Tulsa!

45:55.497 --> 45:57.165
Actually, I'm here to see you.

45:59.334 --> 46:03.305
You know, I've been exactly
where you are right now.

46:03.338 --> 46:04.239
Yeah?

46:05.574 --> 46:06.475
Where's that?

46:07.276 --> 46:12.481
Lost, we're all in
the same boat my friend.

46:16.585 --> 46:19.588
When I was in the Army, I was a
mess.

46:22.190 --> 46:25.260
I used to get so drunk and I'd
wake up

46:25.294 --> 46:29.631
in some nowhere bar and
walk half the day looking

46:29.665 --> 46:30.499
for my car.

46:32.501 --> 46:34.503
I would too if I joined the
Army.

46:35.671 --> 46:39.308
All right.

46:42.277 --> 46:44.279
With all due respect Bishop,

46:44.313 --> 46:47.449
I believe there's a God, I do.

46:48.851 --> 46:50.218
I just don't trust Him.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.757
Life, it's just a big storm.

46:57.392 --> 46:58.527
There's no lighthouse.

47:01.229 --> 47:05.868
There once was a man who was
shipwrecked

47:06.768 --> 47:07.870
in middle of the sea.

47:11.941 --> 47:15.177
He was in a fierce storm and
he just knew he was gonna die.

47:17.312 --> 47:20.182
So he cried out, "God save me!"

47:22.718 --> 47:26.321
And all of a sudden, his ship
caught fire.

47:28.657 --> 47:33.295
He jumped overboard and
clutching to a piece of a hull,

47:33.328 --> 47:38.266
I mean angry and scared.

47:40.903 --> 47:42.805
And he cried out again,

47:43.806 --> 47:44.706
"Why did you abandon me?

47:44.740 --> 47:48.845
"I asked for help and you burnt
my ship."

47:51.513 --> 47:53.248
And all of a sudden,

47:53.281 --> 47:57.586
this huge ship just cuts
right through the storm

47:57.619 --> 47:59.221
and pulls the man to safety.

48:00.522 --> 48:02.224
And the captain said to the man,

48:03.225 --> 48:05.795
"It's a good thing that
your ship caught fire

48:06.561 --> 48:09.531
"'cause if it hadn't, we
never would have seen you."

48:13.368 --> 48:16.973
God's ways are above our ways.

48:17.006 --> 48:18.841
His thoughts above our thoughts.

48:19.508 --> 48:21.309
Who can know the mind of God?

48:22.411 --> 48:26.448
God could have wiped us all
out, the whole human race.

48:27.716 --> 48:30.552
But instead he said,
"No, they are worth it."

48:33.622 --> 48:35.825
God doesn't need us, He wants
us.

48:37.492 --> 48:39.829
That's why Jesus came
and died on the cross.

48:41.396 --> 48:42.631
We're saved by love Tommy.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.535
It doesn't always come in
the form of a lighthouse

48:46.568 --> 48:47.736
or lightning in the sky.

48:50.405 --> 48:54.342
Sometimes our ship needs to
burn before we're rescued.

48:55.978 --> 49:00.983
And sometimes the answer just
may come in a small voice.

49:04.753 --> 49:06.388
I really need to get this car
done

49:06.421 --> 49:07.589
if that's okay with you.

49:16.498 --> 49:20.469
I'm gonna leave this for
you right here, just in case.

49:23.605 --> 49:25.674
I recommend you start
with the book of John.

49:54.804 --> 49:57.974
Tulsa, Tulsa!

50:06.481 --> 50:07.349
Sorry kid.

50:26.501 --> 50:27.335
Hey kid.

50:30.438 --> 50:31.606
I'll take care of you.

50:36.678 --> 50:38.848
It's what I'm afraid of.

50:58.466 --> 50:59.936
Practicing your moves?

51:01.103 --> 51:04.874
I wasn't dancing, I was.

51:09.411 --> 51:10.112
How do I look?

51:16.418 --> 51:18.988
You still have your
scruff, but you look good.

51:19.021 --> 51:20.589
Like a nice criminal.

51:22.724 --> 51:24.726
I look GQ Didi, GQ.

51:26.128 --> 51:26.996
Don't forget that.

51:40.575 --> 51:44.479
- Hello Ms. Murray.
- Mrs. Murray.

51:44.512 --> 51:47.884
Mr. Colston, Tulsa.

51:47.917 --> 51:48.985
Hello.

51:49.018 --> 51:53.022
Now, Ms. Jaylene has
given me a little background

51:53.055 --> 51:54.723
on your situation.

51:54.756 --> 51:56.792
How's everything been going?

51:56.826 --> 51:58.828
Everything's great, right
Tommy?

52:00.762 --> 52:04.166
Of course, we are blessed.

52:08.070 --> 52:12.008
Just so blessed to be here

52:13.708 --> 52:18.713
with God in our hearts.

52:19.015 --> 52:22.751
What Tommy is trying to say
is that we are very blessed

52:22.785 --> 52:24.486
to have found one another.

52:26.188 --> 52:31.193
Yes, yes, praise Him, praise
Him!

52:35.131 --> 52:38.566
For we are blessed.

52:41.569 --> 52:42.637
Shall we sit?

52:44.739 --> 52:46.675
Please, my chair.

52:46.708 --> 52:47.575
Yes ma'am.

52:51.713 --> 52:52.580
Thank you.

52:53.983 --> 52:54.884
Yes ma'am.

53:08.898 --> 53:10.833
Are you hot Mr. Colston?

53:12.101 --> 53:17.106
Yeah, yeah, I'd like to think
that I am.

53:17.139 --> 53:20.076
No, you seem flushed.

53:20.109 --> 53:21.576
Are you nervous?

53:21.609 --> 53:22.510
- Yes.
- No.

53:24.246 --> 53:25.181
- No
- Yes.

53:29.751 --> 53:31.720
Tommy's not been feeling well.

53:31.753 --> 53:32.788
The flu maybe.

53:38.861 --> 53:40.096
I'm sorry, excuse me.

53:45.935 --> 53:47.569
Perhaps I should reschedule.

53:48.437 --> 53:53.641
No Ms Kerry, I know
this place is not normal

53:53.876 --> 53:56.045
and Tommy's really nervous right
now,

53:57.746 --> 53:59.782
but he's a really good father.

54:01.117 --> 54:03.919
Sure, he's far from perfect,

54:03.953 --> 54:07.289
but each day he wakes up and
works harder than the last.

54:08.723 --> 54:11.827
Please, give us a chance.

54:14.729 --> 54:17.933
Tell Mr. Colston, I hope
he gets better really soon

54:17.967 --> 54:19.667
and I mean really soon.

54:21.070 --> 54:23.571
Yes ma'am, he will.

54:23.605 --> 54:25.341
Thank you Mrs. Murray!

54:25.374 --> 54:28.344
Ms. Jaylene will be in contact
with you

54:28.377 --> 54:31.746
until I'm able to do a good home
study.

54:34.316 --> 54:37.153
- Goodbye, for now.
- Bye!

54:52.034 --> 54:52.935
Tommy.

55:23.132 --> 55:27.269
Oh hello, can I please
speak to Mr. Chainsaw?

55:35.811 --> 55:38.981
Oh hello, my name is Trixy

55:43.152 --> 55:44.820
at Colston customs.

55:45.620 --> 55:48.756
I know, I sound a lot younger
than I am.

55:52.995 --> 55:55.131
I just wanted to let you know

55:55.164 --> 55:58.334
that you have been entered in
a chance to win a custom bike.

56:00.768 --> 56:02.805
Yes, yes that's right.

56:02.838 --> 56:05.207
We're having the drawing
here at the garage

56:05.241 --> 56:06.876
but you need to be here to win.

56:07.810 --> 56:12.680
Bring two forms of ID,
oh and a credit card.

56:19.488 --> 56:22.858
Thank you, thank you, thanks,
thank you,

56:26.862 --> 56:28.763
thank you very much.

56:28.797 --> 56:29.731
What's all this.

56:30.698 --> 56:34.103
Oh, it's a drawing they're
having for a custom bike.

56:34.136 --> 56:35.204
- Drawing?
- Mmh mmh.

56:37.039 --> 56:37.907
Excuse me.

56:42.111 --> 56:43.913
Okay, I don't know what's going
on here,

56:43.946 --> 56:47.082
but we are not giving anything
away.

56:47.116 --> 56:48.083
Where's Trixy?

56:48.117 --> 56:49.717
Yeah, Trixy will know.

56:49.751 --> 56:51.220
I am Trixy.

56:52.955 --> 56:54.957
Tulsa, what are you doing?

56:56.058 --> 56:57.193
Getting the rent money.

56:57.226 --> 57:00.296
- You lied?
- No, Trixy lied.

57:01.163 --> 57:02.164
Tiny, help me up.

57:07.903 --> 57:09.805
Thank you all for coming,

57:09.838 --> 57:14.843
but I must confess, there's no
drawing.

57:15.244 --> 57:17.046
This is bull, I'm leaving.

57:17.079 --> 57:18.013
You can't leave.

57:18.914 --> 57:20.216
I have all your keys,

57:20.249 --> 57:22.518
but you'll all get them
back once everyone here

57:22.551 --> 57:23.452
has paid their bill.

57:23.485 --> 57:24.620
What are you talking about?

57:24.653 --> 57:27.056
I paid JB when I
picked up my bike last week.

57:27.089 --> 57:27.923
Me too!

57:27.957 --> 57:28.824
I paid him in cash.

57:28.857 --> 57:30.125
I always pay my bills.

57:30.159 --> 57:33.529
JB, you stealing from me?

57:33.562 --> 57:34.863
I gave you the money.

57:38.200 --> 57:41.270
You were just so strung out,
you probably don't remember.

57:42.204 --> 57:43.405
Is everyone lying?

57:46.108 --> 57:47.243
Search him Tiny.

57:47.276 --> 57:48.344
Come on, hey!

57:53.515 --> 57:54.783
Yo, I was keeping this
place running before

57:54.817 --> 57:56.118
that little brat showed up.

57:58.587 --> 58:02.858
If you ever talk about my
daughter like that again,

58:02.891 --> 58:04.827
you will leave here on a
stretcher.

58:09.131 --> 58:12.401
Okay, this ain't over Tommy.

58:23.979 --> 58:26.915
Give them their keys back
Trixy.

58:28.917 --> 58:30.019
Take your keys.

58:38.994 --> 58:42.031
Tulsa, you can't do that
again.

58:45.934 --> 58:47.336
It worked didn't it?

58:49.405 --> 58:50.406
I'll make dinner.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.574
Wait, it's been a great week.

58:54.009 --> 58:56.345
First the inspection, now the
rent,

58:57.279 --> 58:58.847
we're going out to celebrate.

59:02.518 --> 59:03.852
Can I invite someone?

59:05.054 --> 59:06.922
Was your pizza good?

59:06.955 --> 59:08.157
Yeah.

59:08.190 --> 59:10.259
Do you want another
piece?

59:10.292 --> 59:10.959
No.

59:10.993 --> 59:14.930
Kerry wasn't 100% convinced,

59:14.963 --> 59:16.932
but you are safe for the time
being

59:16.965 --> 59:18.567
which is good enough.

59:18.600 --> 59:20.035
To good enough.

59:20.069 --> 59:21.203
- Cheers!
- To good enough, cheers!

59:28.210 --> 59:29.078
What's wrong?

59:30.145 --> 59:31.880
I think the ice cream's
spoiled.

59:33.615 --> 59:34.616
Mine tastes fine.

59:35.617 --> 59:36.485
Smell it.

59:42.391 --> 59:44.159
I can't believe I fell for
that.

59:44.893 --> 59:47.496
Rookie move Tommy, rookie
move.

59:48.697 --> 59:50.966
What was Tommy like in high
school?

59:50.999 --> 59:51.934
Oh, here we go.

59:51.967 --> 59:55.204
He was a renegade, always
cutting it up

59:55.237 --> 59:59.208
in the parking lot with his
friends, challenging authority.

59:59.241 --> 01:00:00.676
Okay, she's heard enough.

01:00:00.709 --> 01:00:04.046
But, this one time after
school my truck wouldn't start

01:00:04.079 --> 01:00:07.216
and your father saw me
crying and he came over

01:00:07.249 --> 01:00:09.385
and he asked me to pop the hood.

01:00:09.418 --> 01:00:11.320
He fixed it in like two minutes.

01:00:11.353 --> 01:00:12.287
The red silver auto?

01:00:12.321 --> 01:00:14.623
Mmh mmh, it was my father's.

01:00:14.656 --> 01:00:16.425
He had passed a year before.

01:00:17.659 --> 01:00:18.560
I remember that?

01:00:24.266 --> 01:00:28.404
Didi, this song, it's time
for your first dance lesson.

01:00:28.437 --> 01:00:29.505
- No.
- Come on.

01:00:29.538 --> 01:00:31.006
No way.

01:00:31.039 --> 01:00:32.241
Whoa, whoa, what is all this?

01:00:32.274 --> 01:00:33.075
Tell this one here to go

01:00:33.108 --> 01:00:35.144
to the daddy, daughter dance
with me.

01:00:35.177 --> 01:00:37.112
I don't wanna go, okay.

01:00:37.146 --> 01:00:40.082
She doesn't wanna go
because she can't dance.

01:00:40.115 --> 01:00:43.552
Oh well, I would've loved
to have gone to a dance

01:00:43.585 --> 01:00:44.453
with my father.

01:00:45.621 --> 01:00:47.689

it's done.

Dear Michael,
I miss you so much.

01:02:21.083 --> 01:02:22.819
I can't wait to see you again.

01:02:22.852 --> 01:02:25.521
I pray for you every day.

01:02:25.554 --> 01:02:28.257
Always remember Jesus loves you.

01:02:28.290 --> 01:02:29.124
I'll try and call you

01:02:29.157 --> 01:02:31.360
when Ms. Jaylene gives me your
number.

01:02:31.393 --> 01:02:33.796
I pray one day we can
be together as a family.

01:02:34.463 --> 01:02:39.268
I love you very, very much, love
Tulsa.

01:02:39.301 --> 01:02:43.138
P.S., remember, don't eat the
crayons,

01:02:43.171 --> 01:02:44.273
they give you diarrhea.

01:03:10.132 --> 01:03:11.433
There you are.

01:03:12.501 --> 01:03:13.502
Tiny needs your help.

01:03:18.273 --> 01:03:19.441
Why did you lie to me?

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:21.543
Lie to you?

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:24.446
What are you talking about?

01:03:25.314 --> 01:03:29.418
I haven't had a drink,
no cigarettes, no pills.

01:03:29.451 --> 01:03:32.154
No, why did you lie about me?

01:03:33.689 --> 01:03:35.892
You knew about me all along.

01:03:35.925 --> 01:03:37.125
Wait a second.

01:03:37.159 --> 01:03:38.360
Where's this coming from?

01:03:41.864 --> 01:03:43.800
I found this in your desk
drawer.

01:03:50.305 --> 01:03:52.507
I told you to stay out of my
stuff.

01:03:52.541 --> 01:03:54.443
You knew I was out there.

01:03:54.476 --> 01:03:55.812
You didn't care one bit.

01:04:01.650 --> 01:04:02.551
This isn't you.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.253
Then who is it?

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:08.891
This is my son.

01:04:20.268 --> 01:04:21.737
I have a brother?

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:23.672
Where is he?

01:04:29.745 --> 01:04:30.612
He's gone.

01:04:32.982 --> 01:04:33.850
Where'd he go?

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:43.625
I told you to stay out of my
stuff.

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:47.797
This is none of your business.

01:04:49.464 --> 01:04:51.366
Tommy, stop!

01:04:56.471 --> 01:04:58.440
- Hey handsome!
- Hey.

01:05:04.312 --> 01:05:05.280
So what'd they say?

01:05:05.313 --> 01:05:07.549
Well, I figured out
what's wrong with me.

01:05:08.483 --> 01:05:09.384
And?

01:05:11.553 --> 01:05:12.387
I'm pregnant.

01:05:15.457 --> 01:05:16.491
Pregnant?

01:05:16.525 --> 01:05:19.661
Yeah, the clinic thinks
I'm about four months.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:23.331
It's a boy!

01:05:25.467 --> 01:05:26.836
She said he looks healthy.

01:05:27.536 --> 01:05:30.672
I mean, of course I have to
go see a real baby doctor.

01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:33.142
You should come.

01:05:33.176 --> 01:05:35.444
Yeah, you should definitely
come,

01:05:39.481 --> 01:05:40.582
if you want to.

01:05:43.752 --> 01:05:47.255
Hey, tell me you're happy?

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:51.928
Tommy, I need to hear you say
it.

01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:58.901
Okay look, we'll stop
everything.

01:06:00.069 --> 01:06:00.937
We'll get clean.

01:06:02.071 --> 01:06:03.005
I've already got my meds
adjusted.

01:06:03.039 --> 01:06:06.008
I can get my moods under
control, I promise.

01:06:08.443 --> 01:06:11.379
Really, just like that?

01:06:13.381 --> 01:06:14.884
Tommy, I want this.

01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:16.618
I want it with you.

01:06:19.387 --> 01:06:20.455
This is your son.

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:24.559
Is it?

01:06:27.462 --> 01:06:28.663
What?

01:06:28.697 --> 01:06:29.564
What do you mean?

01:06:33.468 --> 01:06:34.569
Tommy, talk to me.

01:06:39.341 --> 01:06:40.308
Get rid of it.

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:52.654
You don't mean that.

01:08:40.062 --> 01:08:42.865
Lisa, it's me.

01:08:45.767 --> 01:08:47.769
I'm sorry, I was stupid.

01:08:52.942 --> 01:08:54.109
Please just come home.

01:08:56.478 --> 01:08:57.712
We'll figure all this out.

01:08:59.613 --> 01:09:02.885

01:11:52.788 --> 01:11:54.290
I just had to get some
closure.

01:11:56.192 --> 01:11:57.960
You wanna talk about it?

01:11:59.862 --> 01:12:00.728
Please?

01:12:06.035 --> 01:12:08.137
A girl named Lisa painted this
painting.

01:12:10.906 --> 01:12:12.908
She always said it was a
portrait of me.

01:12:15.277 --> 01:12:17.146
The ship in the middle of the
storm.

01:12:21.817 --> 01:12:23.252
A man without a home.

01:12:27.456 --> 01:12:29.091
Who is Lisa?

01:12:32.895 --> 01:12:33.996
She was my girlfriend

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:39.767
and the mother of my son.

01:12:42.838 --> 01:12:47.409
So what happened to him, your
son?

01:12:51.013 --> 01:12:52.680
I wasn't ready to be a father.

01:12:57.719 --> 01:13:02.258
And Lisa, she was fragile.

01:13:06.095 --> 01:13:07.429
And I pushed her.

01:13:10.966 --> 01:13:13.302
I pushed her until she broke.

01:13:19.141 --> 01:13:20.943
I'm still not ready to be a
father.

01:13:25.114 --> 01:13:26.148
Let's be honest,

01:13:30.953 --> 01:13:31.820
I'm no good.

01:13:33.122 --> 01:13:34.123

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:35.150

01:15:35.177 --> 01:15:36.045

I'm gonna be late for school.

01:16:40.409 --> 01:16:42.611
Calm down Didi, just give me a
minute.

01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:44.613
School is just a few blocks.

01:16:44.646 --> 01:16:46.315
I can walk from here.

01:16:46.348 --> 01:16:47.683
That's not a good idea.

01:16:47.716 --> 01:16:49.385
Just wait in the truck.

01:16:49.418 --> 01:16:51.553
I'll be fine, please?

01:16:51.587 --> 01:16:53.522
I'm not a baby.

01:16:53.555 --> 01:16:55.657
I can walk three blocks on my
own.

01:16:58.494 --> 01:17:03.499
Okay, but look look both ways
twice

01:17:04.066 --> 01:17:06.502
and don't ride with any
strangers.

01:17:06.535 --> 01:17:08.637
No one stranger than you?

01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:09.705
Ha ha!

01:17:09.738 --> 01:17:10.606
Bye!

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:12.975
Be careful.

01:17:41.069 --> 01:17:42.070
Oh my God.

01:17:47.776 --> 01:17:48.544
Oh my goodness, oh my
goodness, oh my goodness!

01:17:48.577 --> 01:17:49.678
Don't move her, don't move
her.

01:17:49.711 --> 01:17:50.546
Don't move her!

01:17:50.579 --> 01:17:51.547
Sweetie, sweetie, how did this
happen?

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.581
I didn't see her!

01:17:52.614 --> 01:17:53.449
I hit her!

01:17:53.482 --> 01:17:55.117
Sweetie, come on, open your
eyes!

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:57.152
Come on, come back to us!

01:18:08.730 --> 01:18:09.565
Tommy.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.501
What?

01:18:15.571 --> 01:18:17.005
Where is she right now?

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:23.178
Tulsa, Tulsa!

01:18:24.413 --> 01:18:25.714
Please stay back sir.

01:18:25.747 --> 01:18:26.582
That's my daughter.

01:18:26.615 --> 01:18:27.549
She was hit by that bus.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:29.218
She's alive, but unconscious.

01:18:29.251 --> 01:18:30.787
We're sending her to Children's
Healthcare of Atlanta.

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:32.254
Tulsa daddy's here.

01:18:32.287 --> 01:18:33.155
Are you okay?

01:18:33.188 --> 01:18:35.557
Tulsa, daddy's here okay.

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:36.625
I'm here, daddy's here.

01:18:37.526 --> 01:18:39.161
Tulsa wake up.

01:18:39.194 --> 01:18:40.229
Daddy?

01:18:40.262 --> 01:18:41.263
We're gonna get you
taken care of okay, okay?

01:18:43.365 --> 01:18:44.199
I hurt.

01:18:44.233 --> 01:18:45.133
I know you hurt baby.

01:18:45.835 --> 01:18:46.702
I love you.

01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:48.504
I love you Tulsa.

01:18:48.537 --> 01:18:49.438
There's no room.

01:18:50.539 --> 01:18:51.540
Head to the hospital.

01:19:27.309 --> 01:19:32.080
I should have never let her
walk to school by herself.

01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:36.184
Tommy, it's not your fault.

01:19:38.687 --> 01:19:39.822
She's gonna be fine.

01:19:41.690 --> 01:19:42.825
We have to believe that.

01:19:53.903 --> 01:19:55.604
Tulsa's family, Tulsa's
family?

01:19:56.605 --> 01:19:57.807
How is she?

01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:58.707
Come here.

01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:04.881
Right now Tulsa is in a
medically induced coma.

01:20:04.914 --> 01:20:06.883
She's in critical condition.

01:20:06.916 --> 01:20:09.484
She did sustain several
injuries, now the least of which

01:20:09.518 --> 01:20:10.586
is the one to her head.

01:20:10.619 --> 01:20:13.255
Now, that's the one I'm
concerned about.

01:20:13.288 --> 01:20:15.424
She has a major subdural
hematoma.

01:20:15.457 --> 01:20:16.491
What is that?

01:20:16.525 --> 01:20:21.296
It's bleeding inside the
skull, around the brain.

01:20:21.330 --> 01:20:22.097
It causes a lot of pressure.

01:20:22.130 --> 01:20:23.800
We have to relieve that
pressure.

01:20:25.868 --> 01:20:26.535
I wanna see her.

01:20:26.568 --> 01:20:29.338
Yeah, and you can but not now.

01:20:29.371 --> 01:20:31.540
What your little girl needs
right now is a lot of rest.

01:20:31.573 --> 01:20:35.677
What she doesn't need is any
sort of stimulation, okay.

01:20:35.711 --> 01:20:38.447
So I want you to wait here
and I'll keep you posted.

01:20:38.480 --> 01:20:40.282
- All right.
- Hey look, I'm sorry

01:20:40.315 --> 01:20:41.516
that this happened.

01:20:41.550 --> 01:20:42.819
- Thanks Doc.
- Yeah.

01:20:51.393 --> 01:20:53.195
Is everything okay?

01:21:16.685 --> 01:21:20.255
Mr. Colston, you may go in
and see your daughter now,

01:21:20.288 --> 01:21:22.892
but just so you know, she's
still not awake, okay.

01:21:22.925 --> 01:21:24.493
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:21:24.526 --> 01:21:25.394
Right this way.

01:21:57.794 --> 01:22:02.330
I'm here Didi, daddy's here.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.349
Excuse me sir, could
you give me a moment?

01:22:37.834 --> 01:22:39.434
Come home Tulsa.

01:23:05.494 --> 01:23:06.863
Okay, she's finally awake,

01:23:07.596 --> 01:23:10.365
but she's a very sick
little girl, all right.

01:23:10.398 --> 01:23:11.666
But she's demanding to see you.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.368
Now, before you go in there,

01:23:13.401 --> 01:23:14.503
I want you to know

01:23:14.536 --> 01:23:17.073
that your daughter has a
very long road ahead of her.

01:23:17.106 --> 01:23:19.474
So, take it easy on her, all
right?

01:23:19.508 --> 01:23:20.910
- All right.
- Sure.

01:23:20.943 --> 01:23:22.644
- Thanks Doc.
- You're welcome.

01:23:55.912 --> 01:23:57.079
I missed you.

01:23:59.148 --> 01:24:01.918
I looked both ways twice, I
did.

01:24:11.526 --> 01:24:13.395
It's not your fault.

01:24:17.465 --> 01:24:19.936
My head, it hurts really bad.

01:24:24.106 --> 01:24:25.373
I know it does.

01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:30.779
We're gonna get you fixed, okay.

01:24:36.484 --> 01:24:38.486
I don't know if I can.

01:24:41.723 --> 01:24:43.059
Yes, you can.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:47.129
You're a fighter Didi.

01:24:53.135 --> 01:24:56.038
Here, we're in this together
Didi.

01:25:08.683 --> 01:25:10.820
Why do you call me Didi?

01:25:16.993 --> 01:25:19.161
I'll make you a promise,

01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:22.999
when you get out of here,

01:25:26.068 --> 01:25:26.936
I'll tell you.

01:25:29.005 --> 01:25:29.839
Deal?

01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:32.074
Deal.

01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:48.757
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:25:48.791 --> 01:25:53.762
That's what I'm afraid of.

01:25:53.796 --> 01:25:54.864
I love you.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:25:59.135
I love you too.

01:26:10.645 --> 01:26:11.479
Hey there.

01:26:14.216 --> 01:26:15.151
Bishop Franklin!

01:26:16.152 --> 01:26:18.254
- Tommy.
- Bishop.

01:26:18.287 --> 01:26:19.521
You up for a visit?

01:26:20.923 --> 01:26:23.092
Good, 'cause I brought
some friends with me.

01:26:27.595 --> 01:26:30.632
You liked the so much the first
time you came to our church,

01:26:30.665 --> 01:26:33.702
I thought that we'd come
and sing it for you today.

Sorry I'm late.

01:29:01.050 --> 01:29:01.984
How is she today?

01:29:03.819 --> 01:29:06.721
Her head, she's still in a lot
of pain.

01:29:06.754 --> 01:29:09.058
You think that's what Dr.
Holden wanted to see us about?

01:29:09.091 --> 01:29:10.960
I don't know.

01:29:10.993 --> 01:29:12.760
This is for you.

01:29:16.098 --> 01:29:17.166
- Mr Colston.
- Doc.

01:29:19.168 --> 01:29:20.069
Let's talk.

01:29:24.940 --> 01:29:29.845
Okay, Tulsa is not
responding to treatment.

01:29:29.879 --> 01:29:31.881
The pressure is not being
relieved in her brain

01:29:31.914 --> 01:29:33.681
as we had hoped it would.

01:29:33.715 --> 01:29:35.885
The pressure is just too great.

01:29:35.918 --> 01:29:37.052
Now, if this should continue,

01:29:37.086 --> 01:29:39.255
she is going to slip into an
actual coma.

01:29:39.288 --> 01:29:41.157
Yeah, but she seemed to
be improving last week.

01:29:41.190 --> 01:29:44.860
I understand that but
sadly it's not uncommon

01:29:44.894 --> 01:29:47.695
for a patient to rally right
before a major setback.

01:29:50.432 --> 01:29:51.267
So what do we do?

01:29:51.300 --> 01:29:53.469
I mean, there's gotta be some
options.

01:29:53.502 --> 01:29:56.238
Yes, there's a procedure that
we can do

01:29:56.272 --> 01:29:58.107
to relieve the pressure
but I need to tell you

01:29:58.140 --> 01:30:00.142
that this procedure can be
fairly risky.

01:30:01.210 --> 01:30:02.111
How risky?

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:07.883
I'd give it a 50% chance
of healthy recovery.

01:30:09.985 --> 01:30:10.953
And the other 50?

01:30:11.921 --> 01:30:16.325
That would be either
permanent paralysis or worse.

01:30:17.092 --> 01:30:21.130
So what you're saying is
if we do nothing Tulsa dies.

01:30:22.898 --> 01:30:25.367
And if we have this
procedure she could also die.

01:30:27.002 --> 01:30:30.306
I understand that this is not
good news,

01:30:30.339 --> 01:30:33.142
but it is what we're dealing
with.

01:30:35.077 --> 01:30:36.045
In the meantime, what we'll do

01:30:36.078 --> 01:30:38.380
is we'll manage Tulsa's
pain as well as we can.

01:30:38.414 --> 01:30:41.317
We'll do everything we can
to relieve the pressure

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.485
on her brain and we
will hope for the best.

01:30:44.987 --> 01:30:47.289
But, right now I do recommend

01:30:47.323 --> 01:30:52.328
that you have a serious
conversation with Tulsa, thank you.

01:30:57.866 --> 01:30:58.968
- I'll do it.
- Tommy.

01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:02.104
She's my daughter, I'll tell
her.

01:31:05.374 --> 01:31:07.009
We need to pray for a miracle.

01:31:14.583 --> 01:31:18.387
♪ He's always there with me ♪

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:21.156

01:31:23.892 --> 01:31:28.030

Do you understand?

01:31:50.252 --> 01:31:51.320
I think so.

01:31:56.992 --> 01:31:58.160
It's okay to be scared.

01:31:59.862 --> 01:32:00.562
I'm not scared.

01:32:02.164 --> 01:32:03.932
I mean, I wanna see Jesus and
mama.

01:32:07.403 --> 01:32:08.871
I really do but.

01:32:12.341 --> 01:32:13.242
But what?

01:32:16.278 --> 01:32:20.849
I don't wanna leave you.

01:32:22.584 --> 01:32:24.253
Will you forget me?

01:32:25.421 --> 01:32:26.488
Forget you?

01:32:28.023 --> 01:32:29.191
Are you crazy?

01:32:32.261 --> 01:32:33.095
Forget my own?

01:32:43.372 --> 01:32:45.607
I would forget my own
name before I forget you.

01:32:49.211 --> 01:32:53.549
Besides, we're gonna beat this.

01:32:59.054 --> 01:33:01.123
You're not in this alone.

01:33:03.225 --> 01:33:05.494
I just wanna let you know,

01:33:06.695 --> 01:33:10.099
you're the best dad in the whole
world.

01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:13.335
I love you Tommy Colston.

01:33:15.237 --> 01:33:17.239
And I want you to remember this
moment,

01:33:18.707 --> 01:33:20.909
remember me, right here.

01:33:24.413 --> 01:33:26.582
I know I don't deserve you.

01:33:32.955 --> 01:33:36.058
You're the most precious person
God could've ever brought

01:33:36.091 --> 01:33:36.925
into my life.

01:33:40.262 --> 01:33:43.332
I wish I could make all this go
away.

01:33:48.203 --> 01:33:49.138
I love you.

01:33:58.113 --> 01:33:59.581
Pain management seems to be
going fine,

01:33:59.615 --> 01:34:02.551
but Tulsa is really not
responding to the treatment

01:34:02.584 --> 01:34:05.120
so if you're gonna opt for the
procedure,

01:34:05.154 --> 01:34:07.156
you need to tell me
sooner rather than later.

01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:09.258
I've talked to Tulsa and
she's willing to risk it.

01:34:09.291 --> 01:34:11.026
Okay good.

01:34:11.059 --> 01:34:13.095
I'm gonna schedule her for
Saturday.

01:34:13.128 --> 01:34:14.096
What can I do?

01:34:14.129 --> 01:34:15.030
What you can do young lady

01:34:15.063 --> 01:34:17.099
is you can make sure this one
goes home

01:34:17.132 --> 01:34:19.568
and get some rest that's
doctor's orders.

01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:24.206
He's right, when's the
last time you were home?

01:34:25.374 --> 01:34:26.675
Tiny has got the garage under
control.

01:34:26.708 --> 01:34:28.277
I'm not talking about the
garage,

01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:30.145
I'm talking about you and your
health.

01:34:30.179 --> 01:34:31.213
You need rest.

01:34:33.015 --> 01:34:34.983
When he gets my daughter to be
okay.

01:34:41.156 --> 01:34:44.326
You heard the doctor said
to go home and get some sleep.

01:34:51.033 --> 01:34:51.733
I will.

01:34:54.503 --> 01:34:59.508
Tell me, if you could do
anything in the world right now,

01:35:01.410 --> 01:35:02.744
what would it be?

01:35:03.479 --> 01:35:08.116
That's easy, I'd go to the
daddy, daughter dance with you.

01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:20.596
I wish we could, but you know
we can't.

01:35:42.317 --> 01:35:45.053
She's asleep, why don't you
just go home for the night?

01:35:47.389 --> 01:35:52.227
My home is when I'm with her.

01:35:52.261 --> 01:35:54.062
Yeah, but you're no good
to her or anybody else

01:35:54.096 --> 01:35:56.431
if you go down with exhaustion.

01:35:56.465 --> 01:35:58.835
Now, come on and get
yourself up out of here.

01:35:58.868 --> 01:36:00.636
I'll call you if anything
changes.

01:36:06.508 --> 01:36:07.409
It's okay.

01:36:14.884 --> 01:36:17.619
You gotta take care of you too.

01:36:17.653 --> 01:36:18.654
It's gonna be okay.

01:36:19.889 --> 01:36:20.722
Thanks nurse.

01:36:22.257 --> 01:36:23.492
Get some rest Tommy.

01:36:34.269 --> 01:36:36.405

Tiny called.

01:38:55.277 --> 01:38:56.645
I gotta get to the hospital.

01:38:56.678 --> 01:38:59.381
Tommy wait, you can't.

01:38:59.414 --> 01:39:01.550
Social services have been
notified of your arrest,

01:39:01.583 --> 01:39:03.318
Kerry dissolved your placement.

- They can't do that?
- Unfortunately they can.

Tulsa's still award of the
state.

01:39:06.421 --> 01:39:08.891
Can you come with me and
supervise?

01:39:08.925 --> 01:39:12.761
I would, but I've been
placed on indefinite leave.

01:39:15.764 --> 01:39:17.033
Tell me what to do?

01:39:17.066 --> 01:39:18.266
I don't know.

01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:21.436
All I know is there's a sick
little girl who needs her dad.

01:40:02.511 --> 01:40:03.913
I trust you now.

01:40:20.495 --> 01:40:21.931
She's just a little girl.

01:40:31.974 --> 01:40:33.009
She's so good.

01:40:40.850 --> 01:40:41.851
She loves you.

01:40:49.025 --> 01:40:50.860
Just take me instead.

01:40:53.796 --> 01:40:54.696

01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:05.808
What can I do for her?

01:41:14.482 --> 01:41:15.550

you're not allowed to visit.

girl.

phone down,

the law won't be the only thing

01:42:26.789 --> 01:42:28.690
that gets broken around here.

01:42:28.723 --> 01:42:31.459
Put the phone down now.

01:42:52.815 --> 01:42:55.885
Please God, please.

I'm here to take you to

Will you go with me?

01:43:13.768 --> 01:43:15.271
Are you serious?

01:43:15.304 --> 01:43:17.639

01:43:33.255 --> 01:43:34.123

01:43:43.332 --> 01:43:45.835

Tommy, if you'll excuse us
ladies,

01:43:47.336 --> 01:43:48.838

for.

door?

01:49:27.543 --> 01:49:29.211
Everything's gonna be
okay.

01:49:33.115 --> 01:49:34.283
What's this?

01:49:34.316 --> 01:49:36.418
This is for later.

01:49:36.452 --> 01:49:37.519
It's time sir.

01:49:39.455 --> 01:49:41.023
I love you Tulsa.

01:49:41.056 --> 01:49:42.891
I love you Tommy Colston!

01:49:44.059 --> 01:49:45.294
And I'm proud of you.

01:50:46.121 --> 01:50:48.357
Dear daddy, we both
know

01:50:48.390 --> 01:50:50.559
that life is not fair sometimes.

01:50:51.493 --> 01:50:53.962
But, we can always trust that
God is good.

01:50:54.763 --> 01:50:56.565
Spending time with my daddy

01:50:56.598 --> 01:51:00.235
was the best dream come true,
only better.

01:51:01.370 --> 01:51:04.306
Kids need a great dad you know.

01:51:05.274 --> 01:51:07.609
You must stay strong
and not blame yourself

01:51:07.643 --> 01:51:10.479
for what happened, it's okay.

01:51:11.713 --> 01:51:15.017
By now, I'm in heaven with mama
and Jesus.

01:51:15.717 --> 01:51:18.320
Don't worry, I'll find your son
too.

01:51:19.288 --> 01:51:23.091
Tell Tiny I miss him and
he needs to wash his hands.

01:51:23.959 --> 01:51:29.231
Also, you need to take Ms.
Jaylene out on a real date.

01:51:29.264 --> 01:51:31.300
And I know you like her.

01:51:31.333 --> 01:51:34.203
One more thing, please, please,

01:51:34.236 --> 01:51:38.440
please adopt Michael, promise
me.

01:51:40.342 --> 01:51:41.743
I'll see you on the other side.

01:51:42.478 --> 01:51:47.683
Until then, I love you and I'm
proud of you Tommy Colston.

01:51:47.983 --> 01:51:50.419
Your daughter, Tulsa Colston.

01:52:02.531 --> 01:52:04.533
Did Tulsa have everything
figured out?

01:52:05.634 --> 01:52:06.535
She always did.

01:52:09.771 --> 01:52:11.440
I stopped in at work today.

01:52:12.474 --> 01:52:14.243
You're back from leave?

01:52:14.276 --> 01:52:17.446
No, I stopped by to officially
resign.

01:52:20.148 --> 01:52:21.049
I'm sorry.

01:52:21.083 --> 01:52:25.220
Don't apologize, you're a good
man Tommy.

01:52:26.388 --> 01:52:28.423
- No I'm not.
- Yes you are.

01:52:28.457 --> 01:52:30.359
You risked everything
for that little girl.

01:52:30.392 --> 01:52:31.426
You loved her

01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:33.796
and you cared for her all
the way until the end,

01:52:36.231 --> 01:52:38.467
even though you knew she
wasn't your daughter.

01:52:40.702 --> 01:52:42.571
I saw the test results.

01:52:46.575 --> 01:52:48.243
That test means nothing to me.

01:52:48.978 --> 01:52:52.748
She will always be my daughter,
always.

01:52:57.486 --> 01:52:58.287
So what's the next chapter

01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.355
of your life look like Tommy
Colston?

01:53:04.593 --> 01:53:05.761
I don't know.

01:53:15.838 --> 01:53:18.206
Hey bud, how are you doing?

01:53:22.144 --> 01:53:23.813
How you doing?

01:53:23.846 --> 01:53:24.746
- Huh?
- Good.

01:53:27.616 --> 01:53:29.685
Ready, one, two, three.

01:53:31.854 --> 01:53:32.721
Ta-da!

01:53:39.929 --> 01:53:41.296
There you go.

01:53:42.164 --> 01:53:43.632
