Joey. Time to go.

01:22.610 --> 01:24.779
Oh, aren't you excited?

01:24.904 --> 01:25.905
Get his bag.

<i>(nun)</i> One day the great king
of the silver baboons

01:59.021 --> 02:03.234
came down from a peak
high on a mountaintop on Kilimanjaro

02:03.359 --> 02:09.115
and caught your father stealing
his treasure from a deep, dark cave

02:09.240 --> 02:13.744
from which enchanted rubies
spilled out down the mountainside.

02:13.869 --> 02:17.164
After a great battle with the baboon king,

02:17.289 --> 02:21.001
your father was very badly
wounded and left to die.

02:21.127 --> 02:24.004
<i>But when the baboon king found out</i>

02:24.130 --> 02:28.843
<i>that your father wanted</i>
<i>the enchanted rubies to cure his son...</i>

02:28.968 --> 02:32.138
- Sister! Adam's not breathing!
<i>... he took his own heart...</i>

02:32.263 --> 02:36.308
<i>(nun)</i> Children, children,
move to the side. Adam! Adam!

02:36.433 --> 02:38.477
<i>(child)</i> Is he dead?

02:41.147 --> 02:42.273
Did he hurt his head?

02:42.398 --> 02:45.609
I don't know.
They just said he wasn't breathing.

02:45.734 --> 02:48.779
Well, he's breathing now.
Call Sister Catherine.

02:48.904 --> 02:52.116
- I will.
- Adam. Adam.

02:52.950 --> 02:54.994
Adam.

02:58.372 --> 03:01.709
Don't give up on us.
Don't you give up, child.

03:06.088 --> 03:07.882
Don't you break our hearts.

03:12.928 --> 03:16.474
Oh, Adam. I've tried so hard with you.

03:16.599 --> 03:20.352
That poor little heart of yours.

03:20.478 --> 03:22.521
I don't know what else to do.

03:32.406 --> 03:34.450
Oh, Adam.

I can't do anything right now.

- You missed me.

05:35.237 --> 05:37.531
Since what, yesterday?

05:37.656 --> 05:39.700
Yeah. Why not?

05:44.163 --> 05:46.207
Aren't we goin'?

05:47.166 --> 05:49.418
Yeah.

05:49.543 --> 05:51.587
- Is anything wrong?
- No.

05:53.631 --> 05:57.551
- What do you wanna do?
- I thought we were goin' to the game.

06:01.013 --> 06:03.098
What's the matter?

06:03.224 --> 06:05.518
Steven?

06:05.643 --> 06:08.312
Do you wanna just go some other time?

06:13.275 --> 06:15.569
You don't wanna see me any more.

06:15.694 --> 06:18.197
No, I didn't say that.

06:18.322 --> 06:24.495
It's just... I don't know. Maybe we should
just start seeing other people.

06:24.620 --> 06:27.790
This always happens to me.
Why does this always happen to me?

06:27.915 --> 06:30.376
I let myself get involved,
I wind up getting hurt.

06:30.501 --> 06:33.629
- Caroline.
- What did I do that was so wrong?

06:33.754 --> 06:36.715
Caroline, don't say that.
You didn't do anything wrong.

06:36.841 --> 06:38.717
It's me. I just...

06:39.593 --> 06:41.637
I don't know. It's...

06:43.681 --> 06:45.766
- Come here.
- No!

06:45.891 --> 06:48.144
Caroline, come here.

06:49.436 --> 06:51.480
Come on.

06:54.650 --> 06:57.361
- Don't cry.
- Don't leave me.

07:06.579 --> 07:08.622
I'm going inside.

07:09.373 --> 07:13.377
- Why don't I call you later?
- No, don't. Just leave me alone.

07:13.502 --> 07:16.755
Caroline, I didn't mean to hurt you.

07:17.798 --> 07:20.509
Yeah... Well, you did.

07:46.243 --> 07:48.287
<i>(girl)</i> Did he tell you why?

07:48.412 --> 07:52.792
<i>(Caroline)</i> No, he just said
we should start seeing other people.

07:52.917 --> 07:57.505
He's a jerk.
He could've at least told you why.

07:57.630 --> 08:00.716
Forget it. I don't feel like
talking about it any more.

08:00.841 --> 08:05.179
- Talk about what?
- Steven broke up with Caroline today.

08:05.304 --> 08:08.474
Which one was Steve?
The one with the fig tree in his yard?

08:08.599 --> 08:11.644
No, that was Jackie.
Steven had the sick mother.

08:11.769 --> 08:16.273
No, that was Bob. And his mother got
better, and that's when he dumped me.

08:16.398 --> 08:20.152
- So, Jackie's the one with the fig tree?
- No, that was Mike.

08:21.112 --> 08:23.155
Mike?

08:24.865 --> 08:28.369
- I'm gonna call him.
- Caroline, don't you dare!

08:29.078 --> 08:33.457
My God, the guy broke up with you.
You gotta let him call you.

08:33.582 --> 08:36.460
Caroline, this guy is a jerk, OK?

08:36.585 --> 08:41.715
You watch. I'll bet you he's gonna come
crawlin' back on his knees, saying

08:41.841 --> 08:45.177
"Oh, Caroline, I miss you!
I want you back!"

08:45.302 --> 08:48.639
- Yeah, like they all do.
- You're too good to these jerks.

08:48.764 --> 08:52.351
You gotta learn to put your foot down.
You got too good a heart.

08:52.476 --> 08:55.312
If you let 'em walk all over you,
that's what they do.

08:55.437 --> 08:59.066
What scares me is when someone
as screwed up as these guys are

08:59.191 --> 09:01.026
- doesn't want me.
<i>- (man whistles)</i>

09:01.152 --> 09:05.531
Come on, ladies, we're getting busy now.
You're taking too many breaks. Let's go.

09:05.656 --> 09:09.785
What, is he whistling at us like
we're dogs? Does he ever go home?

09:09.910 --> 09:11.954
All right. I'm going.

09:12.746 --> 09:17.209
I'm going! I'll see you tomorrow night.

09:17.334 --> 09:20.963
- Working tomorrow night, hon?
- Yeah. I'll be here.

09:21.088 --> 09:24.467
OK. Well, you know what?
Walk safely home, OK?

09:24.592 --> 09:27.219
There's a lot of crazies out there.

09:30.598 --> 09:33.058
I'll see you later. Caroline...

09:35.561 --> 09:37.605
He's a jerk.

09:45.196 --> 09:47.239

Hey, Jody. Come on in, come on in.

10:25.945 --> 10:29.406
Cake, ice cream, champagne.
Make yourselves at home.

10:35.538 --> 10:38.874
- John, where the hell is my tuna melt?
- I'm workin' on it.

10:38.999 --> 10:43.879
You're gonna have to work a little harder.
This guy's having a heart attack.

10:45.297 --> 10:49.218
You think you could send Adam
over to table five? Thank you.

10:51.971 --> 10:54.056
OK.

10:54.181 --> 10:57.601
- Oh, great.
- No, wait. That's Cindy's tuna melt.

10:57.726 --> 10:59.770
It's all right.

11:00.896 --> 11:03.232
- Hello.
- <i>(man)</i> Finally.

11:03.357 --> 11:05.401
Here you are.

11:06.026 --> 11:08.654
- Caroline.
- Here you are. Yes?

11:08.779 --> 11:10.197
- Where's Adam?
- I don't know.

11:10.322 --> 11:12.783
Tell him to get his butt out here.
I need him.

11:12.908 --> 11:15.369
Don't cut the cake yet.
Let me get a picture.

11:15.494 --> 11:17.538
- Hey, Caroline.
- Not now.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.376
Oh.

11:22.501 --> 11:25.671
Adam, you cut yourself. Let me see.

11:26.464 --> 11:29.717
Oh, my God. This is pretty deep.
You might need stitches.

11:29.842 --> 11:33.053
Hold it like this. I'll put a bandage on it.

11:35.014 --> 11:37.099
Keep it up, because...

11:37.224 --> 11:42.229
You know what? Let me wash it out first.
Come with me. I'm gonna rinse it off.

11:42.354 --> 11:48.360
If it doesn't stop bleeding, then maybe
Jim can take you over to the hospital.

11:55.826 --> 11:57.870
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

12:04.543 --> 12:07.004
What do you have all over your hands?

12:07.838 --> 12:10.299
Is that syrup or?

12:11.675 --> 12:14.053
It's sap.

12:14.178 --> 12:18.808
You work over in that Christmas-tree lot
during the day, don't you?

12:18.933 --> 12:21.393
Yeah, yeah, I've seen you there...

12:23.187 --> 12:25.231
hauling trees once or twice.

12:26.524 --> 12:28.567
You smell like a pine tree.

12:29.819 --> 12:34.323
Like a Christmas tree.
Maybe I'll stick a star on your head, huh?

12:34.448 --> 12:36.492
Just kidding.

12:38.077 --> 12:42.456
I used to love the way our Christmas tree
smelt when we were little.

12:43.082 --> 12:46.585
Brings back memories, you know.
When life was simple.

12:48.254 --> 12:51.257
Now my parents put up
this stupid artificial tree.

12:51.382 --> 12:55.803
It's all fake. Just not the same, you know?

12:59.390 --> 13:05.438
You just don't talk much, do ya? Don't
worry, I'm not gonna make you talk to me.

13:05.563 --> 13:08.649
<i>(Jim)</i> Could I have a waitress
out here, please?

13:10.734 --> 13:13.612
You'll live. I gotta get back to work.

13:14.613 --> 13:16.198
<i>(softly)</i> Thanks.

13:20.536 --> 13:23.205
Why don't you go over there
and handle it?

13:23.873 --> 13:27.501
- You can do it.
- <i>(man)</i> Give me the quarter.

13:27.626 --> 13:31.547
Hey! Hey! How would you
like to pay for that machine?

13:31.672 --> 13:33.966
It just stole my damn quarter, sweetheart.

13:34.091 --> 13:36.677
That's cos guys like you
pound on it all the time.

13:36.802 --> 13:39.597
What's the matter with you?
It ain't your machine.

13:39.722 --> 13:42.850
As a matter of fact, it is,
so don't hit it any more.

13:43.976 --> 13:46.020
- Thank you.
- This your diner?

13:46.145 --> 13:48.606
No, just my machine. Just wait.

13:56.739 --> 13:59.408
It happens to be a very good investment.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.244
Once it's all paid off.

14:02.369 --> 14:04.413
- Now what brand?
- Marlboro.

14:08.334 --> 14:10.377
Lights.

14:15.341 --> 14:17.384
100s, please.

14:21.889 --> 14:23.432

- That's great.

14:23.557 --> 14:26.852
If you have a problem with it,
come to me next time.

14:39.073 --> 14:41.534
How'd you like to feel that, huh?

14:43.577 --> 14:45.579
She'd make a meal outta ya.

14:45.704 --> 14:48.791
- You know her?
- Don't you remember who that is?

14:48.916 --> 14:53.212
- No. Who is she?
- Well, just wait. You'll see.

14:54.171 --> 14:56.173
Hello. Do you fellas know what you want?

14:56.298 --> 14:59.426
Yes, we do. We would like
to have Caroline wait on us -

14:59.552 --> 15:02.638
if you don't mind - because,
well, we're gonna tip you both.

15:02.763 --> 15:04.807
Yeah.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.144
Thank you.

15:13.065 --> 15:17.903
Switch with me. Those two guys in there,
they're asking for Caroline.

15:19.280 --> 15:21.657
Great. For Bill.

15:27.746 --> 15:29.373
- Ready to order?
- Yeah.

15:29.498 --> 15:30.875
Hi.

15:31.000 --> 15:34.211
So, have you been to
any parties lately, Caroline?

15:35.212 --> 15:39.175
- Do I know you?
- Well, I tell you, I know you.

15:39.300 --> 15:43.637
Dean Albanese's Fourth of July party
in the basement.

15:43.762 --> 15:45.806
Sloe-gin fizzes?

15:46.557 --> 15:48.100
Oh.

15:48.225 --> 15:50.144
Yeah. How's it going?

15:50.269 --> 15:53.105
Well, you know. It's going.

15:53.731 --> 15:57.234
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now I remember.

15:57.359 --> 15:59.570
God, that was embarrassing.

16:01.447 --> 16:04.992
- Good memory.
- It's my pleasure.

16:05.117 --> 16:08.704
You must have been barfin' up
stuff your grandmother ate that night.

16:08.829 --> 16:12.833
I'm not an ogre that lives
under the cigarette machine.

16:12.958 --> 16:19.173
Forget it, all right? Because we all
are just people here, hm, you know?

16:19.298 --> 16:22.510
OK. We're not so bad. My name's Howard.

16:22.635 --> 16:25.221
You know, in case you've forgotten.
This is Patsy.

16:25.346 --> 16:26.472
Hi.

16:26.597 --> 16:29.016
- Cigarette?
- No.

16:29.141 --> 16:31.185
Oh, yeah. OK.

16:34.313 --> 16:38.901
I'm gonna have a cheeseburger deluxe,
and I'll get that medium rare.

16:41.320 --> 16:44.490
<i>(Cindy)</i> And she's yelling
at the top of her lungs

16:44.615 --> 16:48.911

16:49.036 --> 16:53.165
"Your mother's a slut
and your father's a ho!"

16:53.290 --> 16:56.502
All of this right in front of
the Sons of Italy Hall.

16:57.670 --> 16:59.713
This girl, no class.

17:02.466 --> 17:04.510
You got a light?

17:10.432 --> 17:14.811
I mean, he met her at a stoplight,
you know?

17:15.938 --> 17:18.315
She looks like Pete Rose.

17:18.441 --> 17:21.527
You gonna commiserate
all night again, ladies?

17:21.652 --> 17:25.573
You are like wet sand in my underwear.

17:25.698 --> 17:27.741
Ouch.

17:30.911 --> 17:34.081
Anyways... did you call him?

17:39.253 --> 17:41.297
No.

17:42.131 --> 17:44.175
Really?

17:45.759 --> 17:48.512
That's good. That's real good.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.853
Here. Finish my cig for me.

17:56.645 --> 17:59.315
I gotta grab this guy before he stiffs me.

18:00.608 --> 18:02.651
I'll talk to you later.

18:09.325 --> 18:13.954
Why don't you just pay me now? Then

I'm really sorry.

Got any burgers?

I wanna ask you.

21:11.173 --> 21:14.135
How much can we get one of
those cigarette machines for?

21:14.260 --> 21:17.805
Because Patsy and me, we was thinking,
you know, of getting one.

21:17.930 --> 21:20.224
Yeah.

21:20.349 --> 21:25.229
I think you can get one for about 1500,
used. That's what we paid.

21:25.354 --> 21:27.731
Oh, yeah? Really? 1500, huh?

21:29.567 --> 21:32.820

22:26.165 --> 22:28.417
I got your hat. It's right here.

22:29.210 --> 22:31.670
Maybe she wants to share your brandy.

OK? You OK? Huh?

- How, man, what are you doing?
- Patsy, quiet her down.

24:08.684 --> 24:10.895
Here, give me her hand.

24:13.355 --> 24:14.690
Wow.

24:18.444 --> 24:21.822
See, Caroline? See that? I hurt.

24:23.949 --> 24:26.076
Quiet. Patsy, get her to be quiet.

24:30.706 --> 24:32.750
She bit me!

Sure. You know,
I would recommend the rat-lipped jig.

28:31.947 --> 28:36.660
Well, the problem with a rat-lipped jig is
that it catches on underwater growth.

where's Caroline again today?

28:43.125 --> 28:46.378
- She called in sick.
- Called in sick?

28:46.504 --> 28:49.048
That's every day this week. Is she OK?

28:49.173 --> 28:52.468
She called in sick. She's sick, she's sick.
What can I tell you?

28:52.593 --> 28:55.971
- Anything serious?
- Yeah, she's sick of work.

28:56.096 --> 29:00.226
Wasn't this a private conversation
between you and me, Bill?

29:03.562 --> 29:07.274
Don't worry about it. I think she got
the flu or somethin', you know?

29:07.399 --> 29:09.443
She'll be in tomorrow.

29:21.580 --> 29:24.458
Hey. Here you go now. Merry Christmas.

29:25.793 --> 29:29.255
- And what would you like for Christmas?
- A dollhouse.

29:31.632 --> 29:35.094
We'll see you Christmas Day.
Merry Christmas.

29:35.219 --> 29:36.971
What would you like?

30:17.428 --> 30:19.472
OK, I'll see you later.

30:21.515 --> 30:23.934
Michael, don't forget. Pick me up at two.

30:24.059 --> 30:26.979
- Two? AM?
- Yeah.

30:27.104 --> 30:29.148
I have to get up for school in the morning.

30:29.273 --> 30:34.236
You wanted the car tonight. Don't make
me wake up Daddy, because I'll kill you!

30:34.820 --> 30:36.864

- Thanks.

30:53.798 --> 30:56.050
Hi, Caroline. Where you been?

30:56.175 --> 30:58.219
Been all over.

31:16.487 --> 31:19.740
Hey, you missed all the action
in here last night.

31:19.865 --> 31:20.866
What did I miss?

31:20.991 --> 31:24.286
Well, you remember
Bobby Las Vegas, don't you?

31:24.411 --> 31:28.040
- With the motorcycle?
- He don't ride the motorcycle no more.

31:28.165 --> 31:29.291
Yeah? What happened?

31:29.416 --> 31:32.920
He slid on a dead squirrel
goin' around a turn over by Frogtown.

31:33.045 --> 31:35.256
- Demolished the bike.
- Jesus!

31:36.465 --> 31:40.136
- He was in here last night.
- He got drunk as a dog down the street.

31:40.261 --> 31:44.640
He tried to run through the Lowry Hill
Tunnel, but passed out cos of the fumes.

31:44.765 --> 31:49.895
So they brought him in here. He was
in the bathroom throwin' up all night.

31:50.020 --> 31:53.941
- Gee, I'm really sorry I missed that.
- Yeah, only Bobby, huh?

31:57.361 --> 31:59.488
So, Caroline, those two guys, you know,

31:59.613 --> 32:03.451
the ones that were bothering with
the machine the other night last week?

32:03.576 --> 32:07.079
- Yeah?
- Jim seen one of 'em over at St Vincent's.

32:07.204 --> 32:11.333
I went down there to see my cousin Lucy.
She had that thing with her wrist.

32:11.459 --> 32:14.670
Yeah, they had to operate.
Anyway, I see him out in the hallway.

32:14.795 --> 32:18.632
Man, was he worked!
His face was a mess.

32:18.757 --> 32:23.596
Black eyes, bumps, bruises.
Looked like he was hit by a dump truck.

32:23.721 --> 32:26.307
I gotta pick up Lucy on Tuesday.

32:26.432 --> 32:28.225
Come here.

32:28.350 --> 32:30.853
You've been following me home?

32:30.978 --> 32:32.938
How do you know where I live?

32:33.439 --> 32:35.691
Huh? Have you?

32:36.567 --> 32:38.611
Well? Have you?

32:43.282 --> 32:45.326
How's your hand?

32:49.205 --> 32:51.248
Thank you.

32:51.999 --> 32:54.043
I know.

32:57.129 --> 32:59.924
That's the scaredest
I've ever been in my whole life.

33:00.049 --> 33:03.552
I just get squirrels in my stomach
thinking about it.

33:07.098 --> 33:10.810
I guess I don't have to worry
about you telling anybody, huh?

33:12.103 --> 33:14.980
It's kind of a real awkward thing
for a girl.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.945
Well...

33:21.070 --> 33:23.114
Don't take this the wrong way,

33:24.365 --> 33:26.408
but thank you.

33:33.415 --> 33:36.043
I follow you home.

33:37.419 --> 33:39.839
You follow me home?

33:39.964 --> 33:41.966
I...

33:42.091 --> 33:44.009
What?

33:45.302 --> 33:47.388
I wasn't finished.

33:48.556 --> 33:50.599
Finish.

33:53.185 --> 33:56.063
I follow you home when you walk

33:56.188 --> 34:01.527
to... make sure you're... safe.

34:02.778 --> 34:05.281
I've never seen you.

34:06.657 --> 34:08.701
Well, I stay pretty far behind.

34:11.829 --> 34:13.873
- I'm sorry.
- Well...

34:15.458 --> 34:17.793
I mean, don't be sorry. I just...

34:17.918 --> 34:19.712
I wasn't finished.

34:22.172 --> 34:23.549
Finish.

34:25.967 --> 34:29.554
I'm sorry that... I was late...

34:32.056 --> 34:34.226
that night.

34:36.061 --> 34:38.856
I don't think I ever heard you speak,
and when you do,

34:38.981 --> 34:42.610
you apologise to me
for saving me against...

34:42.735 --> 34:45.446
God knows what could have happened.

34:45.571 --> 34:49.617
Why should I be surprised? My life is like
watching the Three Stooges in Spanish.

34:49.742 --> 34:52.953
- Either I'm being dumped or attacked.

what I'm saying any more.

35:01.796 --> 35:04.507
I'll talk to you about this later.

37:08.547 --> 37:10.508

sitting in front of the TV,
looking at the stupid tree,

37:20.059 --> 37:23.979

She misses us or what? Or she hates us."

Just forget the whole thing.
You know, just forget it.

to follow through with things.

39:22.973 --> 39:24.809
Jim!

39:47.414 --> 39:49.458
Hi.

39:53.712 --> 39:57.341
You can always measure your tips
by your sugar jars.

39:57.466 --> 40:02.346
Come 3am, I see empty sugar jars,
I know I've got good tips.

40:06.851 --> 40:08.894
- You like hockey?
- Hm?

40:12.731 --> 40:14.775
- Ever been to a game?
- No.

40:15.860 --> 40:18.320
Maybe we could go to a game sometime.

40:20.823 --> 40:22.867
You took my bandage off.

40:25.411 --> 40:27.580
It's OK.

40:27.705 --> 40:29.748
It's OK, it's OK.

40:34.128 --> 40:36.172
Bye.

40:54.607 --> 40:56.108
<i>(phone rings)</i>

40:56.233 --> 41:01.363
<i>I liked their roasted dishes. I liked their</i>
<i>Italian, that miramisu or whatever it is...</i>

41:01.489 --> 41:02.865
<i>Tiramisu, yeah.</i>

41:04.200 --> 41:07.745
If my brother ever shows up,
tell him I'm gonna kill him.

42:06.512 --> 42:09.974
If you look up long enough,
you'll see a shooting star.

42:11.642 --> 42:14.478
But they're not really stars.
They're meteors.

42:14.603 --> 42:17.314
- Really?
- Falling to the earth.

42:18.774 --> 42:21.235
You can see them good from this bridge.

42:23.779 --> 42:26.449
There's the Big Dipper.

42:26.574 --> 42:28.617
There's the North Star.

42:30.286 --> 42:33.581
- Come on, I wanna show you something.
- <i>(Caroline)</i> All right.

42:37.084 --> 42:39.128
What's this?

42:47.052 --> 42:50.014
It's OK. This is where I live.

42:51.390 --> 42:53.434
Oh.

42:58.773 --> 43:00.816
- Ooh!
- This is my dog.

43:02.526 --> 43:04.570
Hi. Hi.

43:06.280 --> 43:09.283
Good dog. What's her name?

43:09.408 --> 43:11.869
I don't know. He never told me.

43:14.622 --> 43:17.541
I don't mean to be rude to you
in your own place or anything,

43:17.666 --> 43:20.336
but you are a little strange sometimes.

43:21.670 --> 43:24.548
- Would you like some ice cream?
- Ice cream?

43:27.009 --> 43:29.053
No, I... No.

43:32.098 --> 43:34.141
You read all these books?

43:35.851 --> 43:37.895
I don't sleep very well.

43:40.940 --> 43:44.318
Got a... cosy little apartment.

43:53.828 --> 43:55.663
You...

43:57.832 --> 44:03.003
This is from New Year's Eve. Did you take
this from behind the counter at work?

44:09.510 --> 44:11.554
I better get going.

44:13.722 --> 44:15.766
Thanks for everything.

44:20.604 --> 44:22.022
Uh...

44:24.567 --> 44:29.321
Well, tomorrow's Christmas Eve,
and I don't work the day after that, so...

44:30.823 --> 44:33.033
Merry Christmas.

45:13.866 --> 45:15.826
Ow!

45:15.951 --> 45:17.995

46:24.770 --> 46:27.189
Michael! Caroline!

46:29.984 --> 46:30.776
Caroline!

47:21.744 --> 47:24.997
<i># This time of the year</i>

47:30.628 --> 47:33.506
I brought you some cookies. I made them.

47:37.927 --> 47:40.763
Did you have a nice Christmas yesterday?

47:44.058 --> 47:46.102
Can I come in?

47:56.779 --> 48:01.283
- Great weather. What do you think?
- Would you like some ice cream?

48:01.408 --> 48:03.661
Big on the ice cream, aren't you?

48:03.786 --> 48:05.830
No, thanks.

48:13.838 --> 48:17.550
Well, I guess the cookies
are a little on the sugary side.

48:21.679 --> 48:25.141
So, you were all alone for Christmas.

48:25.266 --> 48:30.062
I should have stopped over yesterday.
I should have invited you over.

48:30.187 --> 48:34.191
But... I guess you were already there.

48:36.569 --> 48:40.197
Thank you for the tree. It's so beautiful.

48:40.656 --> 48:43.451
It really made my day
that you remembered.

48:47.413 --> 48:50.082
Did I come at a bad time?
Do you want me to go?

48:51.041 --> 48:53.502
- No.
- OK, then I'll stay.

48:56.672 --> 49:00.134
I'm not even gonna ask
how you got into our house.

49:10.686 --> 49:13.647
- Do you like music, Caroline?
- Mm-hm.

49:21.113 --> 49:24.325
I never heard you say my name before.
It sounded nice.

49:27.203 --> 49:30.790
Would you like to see my records,
Caroline? Caroline?

49:32.291 --> 49:33.417
Sure.

49:48.182 --> 49:50.226
Wow.

49:53.354 --> 49:55.397
They look really old.

49:56.440 --> 49:58.484
They're magic.

49:58.859 --> 50:02.488
They're not magic!
What kind of magic do they do?

50:04.406 --> 50:08.244
In the orphanage
Mother Camilla used to play them for me.

50:08.369 --> 50:12.915
I used to sit in the sunlight
near the window in her office,

50:13.040 --> 50:15.084
and I'd fall asleep to them.

50:16.168 --> 50:18.629
She gave them to me when I left.

50:21.132 --> 50:27.513
Whenever my life doesn't agree with me,
I lie down and I play these records and...

50:27.638 --> 50:29.682
the rain stops falling.

50:32.810 --> 50:34.895
Would you like to hear one?

50:35.020 --> 50:36.355
Mm-hm.

50:58.794 --> 51:00.838
<i>(# piano music)</i>

51:11.557 --> 51:16.604
You must have loved her a lot...
Mother Camilla.

51:20.858 --> 51:22.735
She...

51:22.860 --> 51:25.821
She's the one
who told me about my heart.

51:26.864 --> 51:28.908
What about your heart?

51:31.118 --> 51:34.330
I was... I was a very sick baby.

51:35.581 --> 51:37.625
My heart was very weak.

51:40.044 --> 51:42.505
My mother, she died when I was born.

51:44.715 --> 51:47.885
She died in the jungle,
where she and my father were living.

51:48.010 --> 51:50.221
In the jungle?

51:50.346 --> 51:52.807
My father was a great adventurer.

51:59.271 --> 52:04.318
One day the great king
of the silver baboons

52:04.443 --> 52:09.198
came down from his peak
high on the mountaintops of Kilimanjaro

52:09.323 --> 52:14.662
and caught my father stealing his treasure
from a deep, dark cave at the very bottom,

52:14.787 --> 52:18.916
where magic rubies trickled down
from the top of the mountain.

52:22.002 --> 52:25.089
After a terrible battle
with the baboon king,

52:26.424 --> 52:29.093
my father was wounded and left to die.

52:31.429 --> 52:35.433
When the great king later learned that
my father needed the enchanted rubies

52:35.558 --> 52:38.018
to heal his son with the dying heart,

52:39.520 --> 52:43.691
he was so overwhelmed with guilt
and shame at what he had done

52:43.816 --> 52:49.655
that he took his own beating heart
right from his mighty baboon chest

52:49.780 --> 52:52.533
and placed it in mine.

52:54.994 --> 52:57.496
Mother Camilla told you all this?

53:00.791 --> 53:02.835
You believe her?

53:06.756 --> 53:08.799
And you tell this to people?

53:13.095 --> 53:16.766
Oh, no. It's a nice story.

53:22.646 --> 53:24.690
It's stopped raining.

53:39.705 --> 53:43.459
Magic records and a baboon heart.

53:45.169 --> 53:47.463
You almost got <i>me</i> believin' in it.

53:52.802 --> 53:54.845
How'd you like me to cut your hair?

54:18.077 --> 54:20.121
It's OK. No one's home.

54:25.292 --> 54:27.753
Mind if I ask who cuts this thing?

54:28.671 --> 54:31.549
- I do.
- I see.

54:32.716 --> 54:36.053
- Mind if I ask something else?
- Ouch.

54:36.178 --> 54:38.222
Sorry.

54:41.225 --> 54:46.522
Did you ever think of doing anything else
with your life besides bus boy?

54:46.647 --> 54:50.359
I mean, you must have had
an education at the orphanage.

54:52.069 --> 54:55.197
I'm not very good with people.

54:55.322 --> 54:57.658
Don't let people stand in your way.

54:57.783 --> 55:00.661
They're only people, just like you and me.

55:01.912 --> 55:04.540
Well, maybe not like you.

55:04.665 --> 55:07.918
I don't know
if I've ever met anyone like you.

55:15.134 --> 55:18.679
The first I can remember,
I was four years old.

55:20.306 --> 55:22.308
And?

55:22.433 --> 55:28.981
I wasn't allowed any physical contact or...
even allowed to go out in public.

55:30.900 --> 55:33.110
Why?

55:33.235 --> 55:35.738
My health was still poor.

55:35.863 --> 55:38.908
Cos of the risk of infection.

55:42.244 --> 55:46.874
People were so used to staying away
from me that they always stayed away.

55:49.752 --> 55:51.796
I never got close to people.

55:54.632 --> 55:58.135
Jeez. That's gotta be hard on a kid.

55:59.261 --> 56:03.641
Not being held
or being allowed to hold anyone.

56:10.022 --> 56:12.066
What does your father do?

56:15.069 --> 56:16.987
Uh...

56:17.113 --> 56:19.782
Actually, my stepdad.

56:23.119 --> 56:25.162
Step to the rear.

56:25.788 --> 56:27.957
He's a bus driver.

56:28.082 --> 56:31.210
MTC between Minneapolis and St Paul.

56:31.377 --> 56:35.214
He's a real good guy.
You should meet him sometime.

56:35.339 --> 56:39.802
He was on <i>Candid Camera.</i> They locked
him in a closet. He was great about it.

56:41.512 --> 56:46.225
My real dad is like
oil and vinegar with everybody.

56:46.350 --> 56:48.394
He just don't mix.

56:51.188 --> 56:53.232
Cindy says screw him.

56:55.526 --> 57:00.197
Well, first guy to walk out of my life,
certainly not the last.

57:01.991 --> 57:03.284
Weird, huh?

57:03.409 --> 57:07.913
You're always stayin' away from love,
I'm always chasin' love.

57:08.038 --> 57:10.082
Weird.

57:43.657 --> 57:45.701

might be his girlfriend at that moment.

01:01:40.060 --> 01:01:41.771

- Yes.

01:01:41.896 --> 01:01:43.522
Yes?

01:01:43.647 --> 01:01:45.107
- Say yes again.
- Yes.

01:01:45.232 --> 01:01:46.567
Yes.

01:02:18.724 --> 01:02:20.559
Ten.

01:02:20.684 --> 01:02:24.605
Ten? That was almost two hours ago.

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:31.112
You'd rather be out here
with my cat than inside with...

01:02:31.237 --> 01:02:34.698
with a room full of
strangers and relatives?

01:02:39.161 --> 01:02:41.205
Adam.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.960
Oh, oh.

have this wish I wish tonight.

What?

01:03:01.308 --> 01:03:04.812
That's Mars.
You just wished on a planet.

You know Nick's friend - Ronnie?
He's a cop?

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.791
- No.
- Yes, you do.

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:10.211
He has the sister that bought
the house down by North Shore.

01:04:10.336 --> 01:04:12.421
I never met him though.

01:04:12.546 --> 01:04:15.591
Anyway, look.
I want you to double with us, OK?

01:04:15.716 --> 01:04:20.179
We're gonna go to The Fountain.
Go dancin', have fun. You should come.

01:04:21.347 --> 01:04:23.390
I don't think I can.

01:04:24.183 --> 01:04:26.227

01:05:06.392 --> 01:05:08.436
Cos... I got to know him.

01:05:09.937 --> 01:05:13.107
- And we make sense.
- What do you mean, you make sense?

01:05:14.191 --> 01:05:18.654
He doesn't make sense, I don't
make sense. Together we make sense.

01:05:23.617 --> 01:05:25.661
So...

01:05:26.245 --> 01:05:30.082
Tell me what he's like.
I mean, does he actually speak?

01:05:30.207 --> 01:05:33.836
Did you meet his family yet?
I mean, what's up with this?

01:05:33.961 --> 01:05:38.674
Yeah, he speaks.
No, I haven't met his family.

01:05:39.967 --> 01:05:42.928
- He's an orphan.
- Really?

01:05:43.053 --> 01:05:45.973
No shit. I never met a real orphan before.

01:05:46.098 --> 01:05:48.184
Yeah.

01:05:48.309 --> 01:05:50.644
He's a lot smarter than people think.

01:05:50.770 --> 01:05:52.813
He reads a lot. Got a lot of books.

01:05:54.607 --> 01:05:56.817
He's really into his music.

01:05:56.942 --> 01:05:58.277
Really?

01:05:58.402 --> 01:06:03.199
He's really sweet.
He's like a kid, but it's nice.

01:06:08.329 --> 01:06:11.457
He's got... He thinks he's got...

01:06:11.999 --> 01:06:14.418
He thinks he's got a baboon's heart.

01:06:14.543 --> 01:06:18.547
You see, Caroline? You see?
I told you this man had ape parts in him.

01:06:18.672 --> 01:06:21.926
- I told you!
- He doesn't have ape parts in him.

01:06:22.051 --> 01:06:25.679
It's just a story a nun at that orphanage
told a scared little boy

01:06:25.805 --> 01:06:29.809
who didn't know why he was so...
He's got some kind of heart problem.

01:06:29.934 --> 01:06:34.772
But Adam? You know, you don't have to
sell yourself short either, you know.

01:06:37.149 --> 01:06:40.277
- Well, there's something you don't know.
- What?

01:06:42.238 --> 01:06:44.824
You know when I was out sick?

01:06:44.949 --> 01:06:46.283
Yeah.

<i>(sobs)</i>

01:06:56.710 --> 01:07:00.965
On the way home in the park one night,
two guys tried to rape me.

01:07:02.425 --> 01:07:04.677
Oh, my God.

01:07:04.802 --> 01:07:07.263
Oh, my God. Caroline, are you OK?

01:07:08.431 --> 01:07:13.185
Yeah. Someone stopped them.
It was Adam. He saved me.

01:07:14.937 --> 01:07:17.898
Why didn't you tell me this?
Why didn't you come to me?

01:07:18.023 --> 01:07:20.067
I didn't tell anybody.

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:23.154
Jesus, you poor thing.

01:07:24.113 --> 01:07:26.949
Are you all right?
I mean, seriously, are you OK?

01:07:27.074 --> 01:07:29.326
Yeah?

01:07:29.452 --> 01:07:31.495
God, I don't believe this.

01:07:34.832 --> 01:07:36.250
Holy shit.

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.419
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What?

01:07:39.545 --> 01:07:42.006
What?

01:07:42.131 --> 01:07:44.383
You're gonna be so mad at me.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.303
Why?

01:07:47.428 --> 01:07:51.098
Well, I kind of told Nick that
you would double with Ronnie.

01:07:51.223 --> 01:07:54.226
I... Great. Thanks a lot.

01:07:56.228 --> 01:07:58.397
Look, you don't have to go, OK?

01:07:58.522 --> 01:08:02.276
I mean, you could just forget
the whole thing, OK? Just forget it, OK?

01:08:02.401 --> 01:08:03.944
Well...

01:08:04.069 --> 01:08:06.238
Well, go anyway, OK? Just go, Caroline.

01:08:06.363 --> 01:08:09.158
I mean, you'll have a good time.
He's really nice.

His father owns a hardware store
downtown, you know?

01:08:12.536 --> 01:08:14.997
When was the last time
we went dancing, huh?

01:08:15.122 --> 01:08:20.002
And, look, if you don't like him, he doesn't
turn out to be the glass-slipper man,

01:08:20.127 --> 01:08:22.962
you don't have to see him
any more, all right?

I didn't wanna go out with him.
I didn't know we'd come here.

01:09:29.154 --> 01:09:31.866
This isn't right being here.
This is terrible.

01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:34.326
Let's just go. Let's just go.

01:09:34.452 --> 01:09:39.038
Why? Why don't you just go tell Adam
that you're with friends?

No, that isn't it.

01:09:47.923 --> 01:09:53.095
He's very sensitive. I don't know how he's
gonna react to seeing me with this guy.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.098
Look, why don't you just go find Adam

that we're worried about. It's his heart.

- <i>(Caroline)</i> His heart?
- Yes.

01:13:57.923 --> 01:14:00.926
It's not the normal heart
of a 26-year-old man.

01:14:01.427 --> 01:14:03.471
Excuse me? What did you say?

01:14:04.388 --> 01:14:06.849
We know he has a congenital defect.

01:14:06.974 --> 01:14:11.729
And we do favour,
at some point, a transplant.

01:14:11.854 --> 01:14:15.608
It's been left untreated for far too long.

01:14:15.733 --> 01:14:20.321
He should remain stable
until a proper donor is available.

01:14:20.446 --> 01:14:22.406
And how long can that take?

01:14:22.531 --> 01:14:24.575
That we don't know.

01:14:26.744 --> 01:14:30.873
He's sedated now,
but he became very upset before,

01:14:30.998 --> 01:14:34.585
when we were talking about going in
to relieve the pressure on his heart.

01:14:34.710 --> 01:14:38.923
It took two orderlies, two nurses
and myself just to hold him down.

01:14:39.048 --> 01:14:41.759
We were surprised
that didn't kill him right there,

01:14:41.884 --> 01:14:44.428
what with all the trauma he's experienced.

01:14:44.553 --> 01:14:47.723
However, that's also
a very good sign of hope,

01:14:47.848 --> 01:14:50.226
that he's more than strong enough

01:14:50.351 --> 01:14:54.855
and he can go on living for quite some
time with treatment for what he's got.

01:14:56.690 --> 01:14:59.902
Good evening.
Are you with the lady in there?

01:15:00.027 --> 01:15:02.404
- Yes. Yes, she's my best friend.
- OK.

01:15:04.323 --> 01:15:07.326
- Number five and number seven.
- You positive?

01:15:08.202 --> 01:15:10.496
- Number five and number seven.
- Thank you.

01:15:10.621 --> 01:15:14.542
Just step over here and we'll get
the paperwork out of the way.

01:16:13.267 --> 01:16:15.478
You're not taking off too much, are you?

01:16:15.603 --> 01:16:17.396
No.

01:16:17.521 --> 01:16:21.317
I only want a trim.
Did you hear me, young lady?

01:16:21.442 --> 01:16:23.486
Yeah, I heard you. You told me.

You can't work a miracle,
so just do what you can. Hang tough.

you're not trying to impress anybody.

Mm-hm. Just keep your head still.

01:16:55.226 --> 01:16:58.270

your instructor in this,

01:16:58.395 --> 01:17:04.193

make a disaster area out of my hair, hm?

01:17:06.195 --> 01:17:08.239
Why'd you stop?

01:17:12.243 --> 01:17:16.414
You're not butchering it, are you? I
wouldn't like to have you butcher my hair.

01:17:16.539 --> 01:17:19.166
I'm not butchering your hair.
It's a free haircut.

Yeah. I told them.

you're gonna have to have a transplant?

- Adam.
- No. They're wrong.

01:21:27.415 --> 01:21:29.458
The basement under the porch.

01:21:32.294 --> 01:21:34.338
To watch me sleep?

01:21:35.965 --> 01:21:37.341
Why?

01:21:39.927 --> 01:21:41.971
You have peace.

01:21:43.305 --> 01:21:45.349
I don't.

01:21:46.892 --> 01:21:49.562
My sleep, it's always the same dream.

01:21:50.771 --> 01:21:53.357
The jungle.

01:21:53.482 --> 01:21:58.154
Dreary, twisted limbs. Strangling vines.

01:22:00.239 --> 01:22:02.283
And rain.

01:22:03.033 --> 01:22:05.077
Always the rain.

01:22:08.998 --> 01:22:11.876
I feel suffocated.

01:22:14.211 --> 01:22:16.255
Despair.

01:22:16.964 --> 01:22:19.425
Despair of just trying to survive.

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:23.304
Despair and no peace.

01:22:25.806 --> 01:22:29.351
I'm... afraid if they take away my heart,

01:22:31.687 --> 01:22:34.148
I won't be able to love you the same.

01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:38.444
You are my peace.

01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:43.574
Oh, my God.

01:22:44.366 --> 01:22:50.122
You love with your mind and your soul,
not actually with your heart.

01:22:50.247 --> 01:22:52.083
It's just a saying.

01:22:57.254 --> 01:23:02.259
Why does it hurt so much here when...
you're not with me?

Happy... happy birthday!

Come here. You're so beautiful.

01:25:44.255 --> 01:25:46.298
You get this.

01:25:47.425 --> 01:25:49.468
You get this.

01:25:58.477 --> 01:26:00.521
And you get this.

01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:10.364
Go get your coat.

01:26:11.407 --> 01:26:14.410
- Where are we going?
- It's a surprise.

01:26:18.914 --> 01:26:22.126
- What's that?
- It's a present for you.

01:26:23.586 --> 01:26:26.547
- For me?
- Don't open it.

01:26:26.672 --> 01:26:29.759
It's a surprise.
We can open it later together.

01:26:30.384 --> 01:26:33.679
You got... you got me
a present on your birthday?

01:26:43.105 --> 01:26:45.983
- I have fallen...
- Did you hurt yourself?

01:26:47.610 --> 01:26:49.653
I wasn't finished.

01:26:50.571 --> 01:26:53.824
I have fallen so in love with you.

01:26:55.576 --> 01:26:58.037
So much more than I told you I would.

01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.504
All right.

01:27:13.844 --> 01:27:15.888
OK.

01:27:23.771 --> 01:27:25.815
Come on.

01:28:04.728 --> 01:28:07.273
Clear it out! Clear it out!

01:28:07.398 --> 01:28:09.442
Clear it out!

01:28:13.154 --> 01:28:14.321
- Yeah!
- Oh!

01:29:32.608 --> 01:29:36.445
North Stars! North Stars! Yeah!

01:29:40.282 --> 01:29:45.996
I can't believe you caught a puck.
That's, like... It's, like, never happened.

01:29:46.122 --> 01:29:48.165
Amazing.

01:29:50.459 --> 01:29:52.503
You're amazing.

01:29:55.881 --> 01:29:58.926
Thank you for taking me, Caroline.

01:29:59.051 --> 01:30:01.178
I didn't know if you'd like it.

01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:03.764
You know what I like.

01:30:06.684 --> 01:30:08.769
I'm glad you like it as much as me.

01:30:10.146 --> 01:30:12.189
- I love hockey.
<i>- (laughs)</i>

01:30:14.066 --> 01:30:16.986
You didn't even know
what a power play was.

01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:22.450
I know, but the next time we go
you can tell me,

01:30:22.575 --> 01:30:25.661
and I'll catch another one of these for you.

01:30:30.666 --> 01:30:33.127
It was a good game, huh?

01:30:34.086 --> 01:30:37.047
Yeah. A good game.

01:31:30.768 --> 01:31:32.103
Hey.

01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:35.815
Baby. Wake up.

01:31:36.732 --> 01:31:38.567
We're home.

01:31:38.692 --> 01:31:40.528
Hey.

01:31:40.653 --> 01:31:43.280
Wake up. Wake up.

01:31:45.533 --> 01:31:48.369
Sweetie. We're home.

01:31:51.497 --> 01:31:53.541
Hey!

01:31:56.043 --> 01:31:58.087
Hey.

01:32:13.018 --> 01:32:15.062
<i>(dog barks)</i>

01:32:31.829 --> 01:32:33.873
<i>(sobs)</i>

01:32:55.770 --> 01:33:00.566
<i>(priest)</i> If I give away all my possessions,
if I hand over my body so I may boast,

01:33:00.691 --> 01:33:03.319
but do not have love, I gain nothing.

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:05.738
Love is patient, love is kind.

01:33:05.863 --> 01:33:09.450
Love is not envious or boastful
or arrogant or rude.

01:33:09.575 --> 01:33:11.869
It does not insist on its own way.

01:33:11.994 --> 01:33:14.038
It is not irritable or resentful.

01:33:14.163 --> 01:33:18.375
It does not rejoice in wrongdoing,
but rejoices in the truth.

01:33:18.501 --> 01:33:21.420
It bears all things, believes all things,

01:33:21.545 --> 01:33:24.131
hopes all things, endures all things.

01:33:24.256 --> 01:33:26.300
Love never ends.

01:33:26.425 --> 01:33:29.095
But as for prophecies,
they will come to an end.

01:33:29.220 --> 01:33:32.807
As for tongues, they will cease.
As for knowledge, it will come to an end.

01:33:32.932 --> 01:33:36.727
For we only know in part,
and we prophecy only in part.

01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:40.773
But when the complete comes,
the partial will come to an end.

01:33:53.536 --> 01:33:55.579
I love you.

01:33:57.873 --> 01:34:00.292
You're family.

01:34:00.418 --> 01:34:02.461
Good.

01:34:03.587 --> 01:34:05.631
You're lucky. I love you too.

01:34:09.135 --> 01:34:11.178
Luck has nothing to do with it.

01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:16.434
He was like an angel, you know?

01:34:18.269 --> 01:34:20.729
I never knew life could be like that.

01:34:22.690 --> 01:34:27.862
He was the one thing I followed through
with, the one thing I didn't give up on.

01:34:29.697 --> 01:34:31.741
And I was good at loving him.
