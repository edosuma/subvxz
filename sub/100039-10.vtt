WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:07.540
Meredith:
You're not in it alone.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.250
Man:
Coming through!

00:10.250 --> 00:13.500
It's a nice thought,
but pretty useless in an O.R.

00:13.500 --> 00:15.290
Heads up!

00:23.250 --> 00:25.170
Behind you!

00:26.670 --> 00:28.750
Get her to CT.

00:32.000 --> 00:33.830
Teddy: Clear trauma
one, two, and three.

00:33.830 --> 00:36.580
And let CT know we'll be rolling
upstairs in a few minutes.

00:38.040 --> 00:41.330
Uh, okay, these guys go straight
to the front of the line.

00:41.330 --> 00:43.790
Okay, Altman, take Parker.
Got it.

00:43.790 --> 00:45.880
Page everyone.
It's all hands on deck.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.500
Come on.
Let's move. Move, move!

00:48.500 --> 00:50.170
Hey, hey, hey, if you're gonna
be here, so am I, alright?

00:50.170 --> 00:51.750
Give me privileges.
I can hop in.

00:51.750 --> 00:55.210
Uh, okay, see if Altman
needs help with Parker.

00:55.210 --> 00:57.120
After that,
go where needed in the E.R.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.540
But, Ben, that's it.
I can't have you in an O.R.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.670
Okay, let's move.

01:02.670 --> 01:04.580
The better you are
as a surgeon...

01:06.540 --> 01:07.670
...the more likely it is

01:07.670 --> 01:09.880
that no one else
can do what you can do.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.420
A good outcome, a loss --

01:16.420 --> 01:19.670
100% of that
rests solely on your shoulders.

01:21.460 --> 01:22.960
Levi:

01:22.960 --> 01:25.040
It's a ridiculous amount
of pressure.

01:27.120 --> 01:28.750
Schmitt.
I'm sorry.

01:28.750 --> 01:30.580
I just -- I-I-I-I don't know
why I'm in here.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.040
Oh, you were in the bar.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.750
Uh, are you hurt?
No.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.000
I'm j-- Uh, no.

01:36.000 --> 01:37.710
I, uh -- But my friends.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.830
Mm. I hear you.

01:43.830 --> 01:47.250
But right now,
your friends need your help.

01:47.250 --> 01:49.000
And mine, too.

01:49.000 --> 01:52.170
So, look,
whatever we're f-feeling,

01:52.170 --> 01:54.710
we put it aside
and we help.

01:56.830 --> 01:59.040
Come on, let's go.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.500
Let's go.
Let's go to work.

02:04.960 --> 02:07.460
And I've seen it shatter
the best of us.

02:14.290 --> 02:15.830
Shh.

02:15.830 --> 02:18.500
He had a really hard day.

02:18.500 --> 02:21.710
Yeah, and it just got harder
'cause now he's been kidnapped.

02:21.710 --> 02:23.170
I didn't kidnap him.

02:23.170 --> 02:24.670
I just didn't take him
to the hospital right away.

02:24.670 --> 02:26.040
He wasn't ready.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.790
I-I don't think
a Safe Haven volunteer's

02:27.790 --> 02:29.290
supposed to make
that decision.

02:29.290 --> 02:31.580
I just wanted him
to have one cozy night

02:31.580 --> 02:35.040
before a social worker turns him
into a pile of paperwork.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.000
Oh, my God.
It's the cops.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.170
Okay, okay.

02:39.170 --> 02:40.290
Wait, don't answer
the door.

02:40.290 --> 02:41.290
Wait, wait!
Wait, wait!

02:41.290 --> 02:42.790
Answer the door,
and tell them

02:42.790 --> 02:44.880
that I brought the baby here
for a wellness check with Alex.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.460
He's a peds doctor.

02:46.460 --> 02:47.880
He's in Iowa.

02:47.880 --> 02:49.330
Who is it?

02:49.330 --> 02:50.420
It's Meredith.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.960
Oh, it's Meredith.
Let her in.

02:54.540 --> 02:55.670
You're not Alex.

02:55.670 --> 02:57.750
Oh, yeah, he's, uh,
visiting his mom.

02:57.750 --> 03:00.540
Well, Cristina sent
an obnoxious Irishman as a gift

03:00.540 --> 03:02.790
and he stole
your husband's old job.

03:02.790 --> 03:04.000
And who is that?

03:04.000 --> 03:05.330
Oh, we already have
a bottle open.

03:05.330 --> 03:06.920
Can you get her a glass?

03:06.920 --> 03:08.040
Jo stole a baby.

03:08.040 --> 03:09.790
I did not steal a baby.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.540
Well, that's what I said
when I stole a baby.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.120
Why are people
stealing babies?

03:13.120 --> 03:14.420
He was left
at Station 19,

03:14.420 --> 03:15.880
and they called me
to take him to the hospital,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.580
and I...didn't.

03:17.580 --> 03:19.460
Well, because you didn't want
him to go into the system

03:19.460 --> 03:21.120
and have a miserable life
like you did.

03:21.120 --> 03:23.000
Exactly.
She gets it.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.620
But I'm a convicted felon.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.330
She's a convicted felon.

03:26.330 --> 03:28.670
She's a felon.
She's a convicted felon.

03:28.670 --> 03:30.710
Oh, no.

03:30.710 --> 03:31.960
Multiple traumas.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.080
We should go back
to the hospital.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.120
You know what?

03:34.120 --> 03:35.250
I've had
two glasses of wine,

03:35.250 --> 03:36.710
so I really can't.
Don't worry.

03:36.710 --> 03:39.000
We'll call on the way,
tell peds a Safe Haven's there

03:39.000 --> 03:40.500
waiting for
a wellness check.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.040
You can sneak him
into the nursery,

03:42.040 --> 03:43.460
pretend he's been there
all night --

03:43.460 --> 03:45.620
like he should
have been.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.040
Come on.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.540
Hey, I just heard.
Is everyone alive?

03:53.540 --> 03:55.170
So far.

03:55.170 --> 03:57.290
Uh, do you know
if Maggie has been paged?

03:57.290 --> 03:59.580
I kinda have a thing,
a personal -- a talk thing,

03:59.580 --> 04:01.920
need to -- a girl talk.
Uh, girl thing.

04:01.920 --> 04:03.170
Can you smile for me?

04:03.170 --> 04:04.580
Ew, don't be
that guy, Tom.

04:04.580 --> 04:05.920
No, I want to make sure
you're not having a stroke.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.080
Pierce quit.
What? Why?

04:08.080 --> 04:09.290
Woman on P.A.:
Dr. Mahoney to the E.R.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.040
Hey, big trauma?

04:11.040 --> 04:12.710
You should head upstairs.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.460
Elliott Calhoun was just
transferred to the CCU on ECMO.

04:14.460 --> 04:17.120
Go up there, sit with him,
hold his wife's hand, whatever.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.540
His heart
still hasn't restarted.

04:18.540 --> 04:20.420
I'm chief resident.
I-I should go --

04:20.420 --> 04:22.330
He has a premature baby
and a hole in his chest.

04:22.330 --> 04:23.710
You should go
where I say you should go.

04:26.170 --> 04:27.500
Woman:
We need more O-neg!

04:27.500 --> 04:29.290
Woman #2: I need some
bandages over here.

04:29.290 --> 04:30.670
Man: Get his vitals
right away.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.580
How bad is it?

04:32.580 --> 04:34.960
Simms and Helm
got the worst of it --

04:34.960 --> 04:37.000
well, if you don't count
the couple who were in the car.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.790
Jo: It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

04:39.790 --> 04:41.710
Amelia: Who is that?

04:41.710 --> 04:44.080
Dr. Karev
is a Safe Haven volunteer,

04:44.080 --> 04:46.000
and she is taking the baby
to the nursery.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.460
Right, Dr. Karev?

04:47.460 --> 04:50.210
Yep. Here I go.

04:52.790 --> 04:56.420
So, how'd the ultrasound go?
Everything okay?

04:56.420 --> 04:58.620
Everything is...

04:58.620 --> 05:02.880
Yes. Uh, baby's healthy,
uh, great, developing.

05:02.880 --> 05:05.830
Uh, Lincoln, Shepherd,
can you guys jump in here?

05:05.830 --> 05:09.000
Not only are we swamped,
but we're short-staffed.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.830
Well, not anymore,
because I've called
in reinforcements.

05:11.830 --> 05:13.420
Wha--
Webber and Hunt
were fired from this hospital.

05:13.420 --> 05:14.790
Owen:
Lay off, Koracick.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.670
Richard: Look, I don't care.
They are my students.

05:16.670 --> 05:18.790
I hired them.

05:18.790 --> 05:21.290
Okay, temporary privileges
granted. We need the help.

05:21.290 --> 05:23.710
Everyone, gowns and gloves,
and keep up.

05:25.710 --> 05:27.960
Bailey: Blake Simms,
mid-face instability,

05:27.960 --> 05:29.170
criked in the field.

05:29.170 --> 05:30.830
Needs to head up to CT ASAP.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.420
Hunt, join Avery.
Yep.

05:32.420 --> 05:34.420
I should be in here.
In case there's any neuro.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.330
Any other requests
from the peanut gallery?

05:37.330 --> 05:40.170
Good. Moving on.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.790
Bailey: Taryn Helm,
hemodynamically stable,

05:42.790 --> 05:44.170
tib-fib fracture,

05:44.170 --> 05:46.790
but complains of pain
in the pelvis,

05:46.790 --> 05:50.000
so we need a pelvic X-ray,
chest X-ray,

05:50.000 --> 05:51.120
F.A.S.T. exam,
the works.

05:51.120 --> 05:53.920
Webber,
Lincoln, Grey, go.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.710
Where's Andrew DeLuca?

05:55.710 --> 05:57.000
Uh, around here
somewhere.

05:58.540 --> 06:00.000
No, with patients.
He's working.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.210
Oh.
He's okay, Meredith.

06:01.210 --> 06:02.620
Okay.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.790
Casey Parker -- he took
a nasty blow to the head.

06:04.790 --> 06:06.330
He's got a palpable
scalp hematoma.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.710
Did a bomb go off?

06:07.710 --> 06:09.120
We're taking him up
to CT now.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.750
Uh, uh, well,

She's working through

07:24.040 --> 07:25.460
Mm.

07:38.880 --> 07:40.380
They're always a little off,
though, right?

07:40.380 --> 07:43.250
With the whole
counting-from-ovulation thing?

07:43.250 --> 07:45.540
When I hit 30 weeks,
I thought I was gonna pop.

07:48.830 --> 07:50.830
Temporal lobe contusion.

07:50.830 --> 07:53.250
Yeah, explains
the PTSD exacerbation.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.710
He needs to be in the neuro ICU,
closely monitored,

07:55.710 --> 07:57.580
with q2 hour checks.

07:57.580 --> 07:59.420
Dr. Shepherd,
I just stepped out for a minute

07:59.420 --> 08:01.040
to prep the next patient,
and when I came back...

08:12.330 --> 08:14.290
Taryn: Hi, Doctor.
Oh, my God. Ah.

08:14.290 --> 08:16.250
Chief, there seem to be
a lot of doctors in here,

08:16.250 --> 08:18.170
and I don't want to get in
the way of anyone,

08:18.170 --> 08:19.620
specifically --
You're in my way.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.420
Move. Forward.
How are we?

08:21.420 --> 08:24.120
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm fantastic.

08:24.120 --> 08:25.580
Dr. Grey is here.

08:25.580 --> 08:27.830
Hi, Dr. Grey.
Meredith: Hi, Helm.

08:27.830 --> 08:29.380
Jackson gave her
a whiskey sedative at the scene

08:29.380 --> 08:30.750
to set her leg.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.420
I just gave her a little bit
of fentanyl for the pain.

08:32.420 --> 08:34.460
And the X-ray doesn't show
pelvic fractures.

08:34.460 --> 08:37.540
CT showed an infrarenal
IVC injury with a clot --

08:37.540 --> 08:38.710
That's near my kidney.

08:38.710 --> 08:41.250
It also showed
a small retrohepatic hematoma

08:41.250 --> 08:43.580
by the IVC.
Oh, no.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.330
I'm bruised in the liver.

08:45.330 --> 08:47.620
Doppler shows, uh,
vascular compromise to the foot,

08:47.620 --> 08:49.540
which is probably due
to the fracture,

08:49.540 --> 08:51.620
so I'd like to get her
to an O.R. ASAP.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.290
We should put in
an IVC filter

08:53.290 --> 08:55.580
to reduce the risk
of pulmonary embolism.

08:55.580 --> 08:57.330
Mm. But he just said
my foot could die.

08:57.330 --> 08:59.620
Don't worry, Helm, we got you.
She's not wrong.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.960
I can do the filter

09:00.960 --> 09:02.620
while she's getting prepped
in the O.R. for her leg.

09:02.620 --> 09:04.620
Okay.
Let's get to work.

09:07.710 --> 09:09.330
Can I scrub in?

09:09.330 --> 09:11.380
Sure.

09:11.380 --> 09:13.290
Bailey.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.120
Uh, you have full privileges,
so jump in wherever needed.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.120
Uh, Ben called me.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.330
He shouldn't have
done that.

09:21.330 --> 09:24.500
But like I said,
jump in wherever needed.

09:24.500 --> 09:25.830
Look.

09:29.580 --> 09:31.000
Where are we
on Blake Simms?

09:31.000 --> 09:33.750
Uh, doesn't appear to be any
traumatic brain injuries.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.250
Leave that
to the expert, Red.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.080
Yep, no epidural, subdural,
or subarachnoid hemorrhage.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.120
How many of these
have you done?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.210
Me?

09:41.210 --> 09:42.500
I'm sure it's in our records.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.960
More than 20?

09:43.960 --> 09:45.290
This is a rare injury,
the surgery extensive --

09:45.290 --> 09:46.880
I have had
a long night, Tom.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.580
I don't have the energy
to defend myself to you.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.000
I'm well aware
of your night, Avery.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.380
It's just dumb luck those scans
aren't of you. Or Brody.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.540
You're about to peel off
my protégé's face

09:54.540 --> 09:56.080
and bolt his fractured facial
bones back into their place.

09:56.080 --> 09:57.380
I want to make sure

09:57.380 --> 09:59.460
that you're in the right
state of mind to do that.

09:59.460 --> 10:01.790
I'm good.

10:01.790 --> 10:03.420
Go babysit someone else.

10:03.420 --> 10:06.420
Okay, let's, um,
take him up to the O.R.

10:06.420 --> 10:07.830
Brody, do you know
of any relatives

10:07.830 --> 10:09.420
that we can
reach out to?

10:09.420 --> 10:11.420
I didn't even know his first
name till I saw it on the scan.

10:11.420 --> 10:13.790
His grandmother's local.
I'll call her.

10:13.790 --> 10:16.620
Brody,
just get him to the O.R.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.710
Hi.
Hello.

10:26.710 --> 10:28.830
So, who do we have here?

10:28.830 --> 10:31.960
Oh, Dr. Karev.
Jo Karev.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.750
Nice to meet you.
But I meant the baby.

10:33.750 --> 10:36.080
Oh, right, yes.
Uh, so, boy.

10:36.080 --> 10:37.960
Less than three days old.
Mm-hmm.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.620
Bottle feeding's
been good.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.330
He's sleeping well.
Mm-hmm.

10:41.330 --> 10:43.830
Good job.
Oh, there we go.

10:43.830 --> 10:45.920
Okay.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.960
Let's get that hat off.
Let's have a look.
Shh.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.540
Normal chest contour.
Okay.

10:51.540 --> 10:53.420
Motor function.
Oh, yeah.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.540
Does this hospital
have a baby hatch?

10:55.540 --> 10:57.460
A what?

10:57.460 --> 10:59.290
A baby hatch.

10:59.290 --> 11:01.960
It's like a post box
but for babies.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.790
That sounds not great.

11:03.790 --> 11:05.290
No, actually,
they're brilliant.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.830
Decorated like
a little nursery inside,

11:06.830 --> 11:07.920
connect
straight to the E.R.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.380
Mum puts the baby in.

11:09.380 --> 11:11.790
A sensor notifies
the staff to come.

11:11.790 --> 11:14.120
My last hospital had one.
They're safe and anonymous.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.710
Where was
your last hospital?

11:15.710 --> 11:17.290
That was in Switzerland.

11:17.290 --> 11:18.080
Oh, you're him?

11:19.460 --> 11:20.460
Him?

11:20.460 --> 11:22.380
You're new guy.

11:22.380 --> 11:24.710
New chief of peds guy.

11:24.710 --> 11:26.460
Well, yes,
I suppose I am.

11:26.460 --> 11:28.290
Oh, you're related
to the old chief of peds? Okay.

11:28.290 --> 11:29.790
Yes. Wife.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.040
I've heard good things.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.330
About me?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.120
Um, no,

11:35.120 --> 11:38.080
but, um,
let's have a listen.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.710
I got nothing.

11:39.710 --> 11:41.170
You?
Nothing.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.670
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:43.670 --> 11:44.670
What are you doing
up here?

11:44.670 --> 11:46.000
Uh, scrubbing in
with Avery on Simms.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.120
Type III
Le Fort fracture.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.120
Ugh.
Oof.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.210
Yeah, it's bad.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.670
And Koracick's
leaning heavy on Avery

11:50.670 --> 11:52.080
to get the reconstruction
right.

11:52.080 --> 11:54.330
Well, making sure we get things
right is Tom's job.

11:54.330 --> 11:55.750
Yeah, well,
being an ass about it isn't.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.080
What are you two
looking for?

11:57.080 --> 11:59.120
Amelia: Parker's MIA
with a temporal lobe contusion

11:59.120 --> 12:01.790
and a nasty episode of PTSD
about a really big bomb.

12:01.790 --> 12:03.120
Well, if I were scared
about a bomb,

12:03.120 --> 12:05.620
I'd be looking
for a bomb shelter.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.000
Maybe check the morgue
and the basement,

12:07.000 --> 12:08.460
and I'll meet you in security.

12:08.460 --> 12:09.500
Owen.
Owen: Yeah?

12:09.500 --> 12:11.120
Cut Tom some slack.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.000
Meredith: Umbrella filter
has been deployed.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.460
She's got
the umbrella in.

12:28.460 --> 12:30.790
Thank you, Helm.
You're welcome.

12:30.790 --> 12:33.670
Are you gonna fix
my tib-fib, too?

12:33.670 --> 12:35.380
I don't do bones.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.620
Me neither.

12:37.620 --> 12:40.000
And these are not
regular bones.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.040
These are my bones.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.330
Helm bones.

12:45.330 --> 12:48.540
Helmones.

12:48.540 --> 12:50.960
Helm-mouth.
I get it.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.790
Dr. Schmitt,
let's prep her,

12:52.790 --> 12:54.790
and let's remind Dr. Kim
and Dr. Lincoln

12:54.790 --> 12:57.420
to check her neck for hematomas
and recheck her H&H.

12:57.420 --> 12:59.670
Mm, no, no.
No Schmitt.

12:59.670 --> 13:00.880
It's his fault
you left me.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.120
Helm --

13:02.120 --> 13:05.290
He got
the love of my life fired.

13:05.290 --> 13:07.000
Which is you.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.540
Surprise.

13:09.540 --> 13:12.500
I love you,
Meredith Grey.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.420
And I know it's stupid
and I should get over it,

13:15.420 --> 13:20.210
and I will
if I ever meet anyone else.

13:20.210 --> 13:22.620
I'm starting to think
I never will.

13:25.080 --> 13:28.920
I'm embarrassed now, so I'm --
I'm gonna go prep myself.

13:28.920 --> 13:30.960
Thank you for that, Helm.

13:30.960 --> 13:32.250
Thank you.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.380
We'll have Dr. Kim
prep you, okay?

13:34.380 --> 13:36.080
Kim's a traitor-lover.

13:36.080 --> 13:38.670
Schmitt,
let's go downstairs.

13:38.670 --> 13:40.210
Dr. Schmitt?

13:41.960 --> 13:43.750
Hey! Guys!
Nico: Oh, my God. Levi.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.670
Link: Schmitt.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.500
What?
What's happening?

14:00.080 --> 14:02.080
You fainted in the O.R.,
Schmitt.

14:02.080 --> 14:03.830
I'm doing
a full work-up.

14:03.830 --> 14:06.960
I fainted and you're okay
being my doctor?

14:06.960 --> 14:09.210
I couldn't really leave you
there on the O.R. floor.

14:09.210 --> 14:10.880
They could take away
my license for that.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.750
Your blood work
all looks good,

14:12.750 --> 14:15.830
except for your cardiac enzymes
are slightly elevated,

14:15.830 --> 14:16.880
which could indicate --

14:16.880 --> 14:18.000
I'm having a heart attack?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.540
That's very unlikely
at your age,

14:20.540 --> 14:22.710
but I'm gonna do an echo
just to be sure.

14:22.710 --> 14:24.920
I'm not even 30.

14:24.920 --> 14:27.380
I take fish oil
every morning.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.460
And, y-yeah,
I had double cheeseburgers

14:29.460 --> 14:30.750
every day freshman year,

14:30.750 --> 14:33.500
but since then,
I-I've been pretty good.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.500
Okay, but you do need
to calm down, Schmitt.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.830
Okay?

14:37.830 --> 14:39.420
Is there anyone
I can call for you?

14:39.420 --> 14:42.710
Well, I'd say my mom,
but she'd only panic.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.790
Probably have
her own heart attack.

14:44.790 --> 14:46.420
And then I'd say
Taryn Helm,

14:46.420 --> 14:49.210
but she hates me
because of what I did to you,

14:49.210 --> 14:50.210
and she's dying.

14:50.210 --> 14:51.790
So then I'd say Nico,

14:51.790 --> 14:53.790
but he's in the O.R.,
saving Taryn's life.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.120
There's no one to call.

14:57.120 --> 14:58.500
Take a deep breath,
Schmitt.

15:00.380 --> 15:01.250
I gotcha.

15:04.210 --> 15:06.290
Any updates?

15:06.290 --> 15:08.500
We just finished
temporarily wiring his jaw,

15:08.500 --> 15:10.620
and now we're doing
our coronal incision

15:10.620 --> 15:12.790
to expose the superior orbit
and zygoma.

15:12.790 --> 15:15.120
Alright, keep me posted.
Every update.

15:15.120 --> 15:16.330
You know what, Tom?

15:16.330 --> 15:17.620
You might as well
bring in a camera crew here.

15:17.620 --> 15:19.040
Really great press.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.920
Plenty of human drama
and vulnerability to exploit.

15:21.920 --> 15:24.170
You'd love it.

15:24.170 --> 15:25.250
No? Okay.

15:25.250 --> 15:27.420
Owen: Lap pads.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.420
I do not miss that guy.

15:30.420 --> 15:32.040
Nope. Suction.

15:32.040 --> 15:34.170
Altman could do
so much better.

15:34.170 --> 15:36.000
Meaning?

15:36.000 --> 15:37.620
Are you serious?

15:37.620 --> 15:39.040
Altman's a badass.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.710
She's smart and skilled
and hot.

15:41.710 --> 15:44.620
Koracick's just like
a creepy frat-house uncle.

15:44.620 --> 15:47.040
She has done better, Brody.
She's with Hunt.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.540
Periosteal elevator,
please.

15:49.540 --> 15:52.210
Oh, I'm so sorry.

15:52.210 --> 15:53.500
It's just the way
that he talks to her --

15:53.500 --> 15:55.210
Yeah, don't worry about it.

15:55.210 --> 15:57.210
Skin hooks, please.

15:57.210 --> 16:01.460
Owen, these flaps
are coming along pretty nicely.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.460
Speaking of which,
how are you two doing?
You set a date yet?

16:03.460 --> 16:06.790
W-We're --
We're not engaged.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.750
Really?
Mnh-mnh.

16:08.750 --> 16:11.670
Wow. I figured 'cause you have
two kids together,

16:11.670 --> 16:13.500
you live together,
you marry everyone...

16:13.500 --> 16:16.380
but I guess you have been busy,
haven't you?

16:16.380 --> 16:19.670
Okay, let's, um, take a look
at these fractures.

16:19.670 --> 16:20.750
Sure.

16:23.830 --> 16:25.250
Link:
Almost done here.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.380
If you want to tap out,
it's cool.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.620
I'm fine.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.830
Your boyfriend
did just collapse.

16:31.830 --> 16:33.500
Helm needed
a plate and screws,

16:33.500 --> 16:35.830
so I'm doing
a plate and screws.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.580
Me stopping to freak out

16:37.580 --> 16:39.290
won't change the outcome
of Levi's condition.

16:39.290 --> 16:41.330
And, plus,
Helm is Levi's best friend.

16:41.330 --> 16:42.500
Fair enough.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.710
She's hypotensive
and tachycardic.

16:45.710 --> 16:47.330
Page Bailey.
Woman: Right away, Dr. Lincoln.

16:49.580 --> 16:50.790
Amelia:
He's not in the morgue.

16:50.790 --> 16:53.620
Did you check the exits?

16:53.620 --> 16:55.460
Backed up all the tapes
half an hour.

16:55.460 --> 16:56.710
I didn't see him leave.

16:56.710 --> 16:58.040
Here's the basement.

17:00.460 --> 17:03.250
I can do this without you
if you want to go.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.330
He's a veteran
and he's suffering.

17:05.330 --> 17:08.080
We send people overseas and we
ask them to give up their lives,

17:08.080 --> 17:09.830
their health,
their families,

17:09.830 --> 17:10.960
and when they come home,

17:10.960 --> 17:13.620
we don't even give them
mental health care.

17:13.620 --> 17:14.750
Owen.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.500
And Riggs. And Megan.
And --

17:18.500 --> 17:21.000
And me.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.920
I can't imagine.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.290
Do you think that Owen's --

17:24.290 --> 17:26.120
God.
Forget it.

17:26.120 --> 17:29.670
It's not appropriate.

17:29.670 --> 17:31.500
Do I think Owen's what?

17:31.500 --> 17:34.040
Mm, triggered.

17:34.040 --> 17:36.710
PTSD is about patterns.

17:36.710 --> 17:39.330
Owen has a history
of feeling trapped.

17:39.330 --> 17:42.540
By fear of disappointing,
fear of hurting people,

17:42.540 --> 17:44.000
trapped by obligations.

17:44.000 --> 17:46.880
And I arrived here with a belly
full of a heavy obligation.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.580
Honestly, Teddy, I don't think
that Owen is triggered.

17:53.580 --> 17:56.080
I think...

17:56.080 --> 17:57.080
he loves you.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.040
Well,
he hasn't proposed.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.750
And I feel really embarrassed
saying that out loud,

18:02.750 --> 18:06.290
but it's, uh...

18:06.290 --> 18:09.250
You know, it's -- it's not like
I'm a stupid little girl

18:09.250 --> 18:12.120
waiting for a ring
from a man.

18:12.120 --> 18:13.790
It's just --
Hang on.

18:13.790 --> 18:16.540
If he felt trapped
by an obligation,

18:16.540 --> 18:18.380
don't you think
he would've proposed by now?

18:21.380 --> 18:25.540
I really think
he's just...

18:25.540 --> 18:26.960
trying to do things
differently.

18:28.290 --> 18:33.460
You are incredibly kind,
Amelia Shepherd.

18:37.580 --> 18:39.080
There.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.920
Parker.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.380
The hyperbaric chamber.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.620
Bomb shelter.

18:45.620 --> 18:47.540
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.710
Talk to me.

18:49.710 --> 18:51.880
We repaired her leg, and her
vitals just plummeted.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.960
She's hypotensive
with a worsening base deficit.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.170
Uh, did you check
her abdomen?

18:56.170 --> 18:57.000
No.

19:00.040 --> 19:02.120
Abdomen's distended.

19:02.120 --> 19:04.250
Okay, prep for an ex-lap
and call Dr. Grey.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.750
Okay.
I-I can assist.

19:05.750 --> 19:06.960
Dr. Webber.

19:06.960 --> 19:08.250
Look, I hired Dr. Helm.

19:08.250 --> 19:10.290
I'm gonna help,
and you can't stop me.

19:40.210 --> 19:42.750
His heart.
What is it? What's wrong?

19:42.750 --> 19:44.790
It's coming back.
It's -- It's beating.

19:44.790 --> 19:46.170
His heart's beating.

19:46.170 --> 19:48.330
Okay, uh, need to try
and wean him off

19:48.330 --> 19:49.620
the pacing wires and ECMO.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.620
Oh, my God.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.210
Page Dr. Altman.

19:52.210 --> 19:53.920
Woman: Right away, Doctor.
Oh, my God.

20:01.670 --> 20:04.000
Parker:

20:04.000 --> 20:05.540
Amelia: Parker?

20:05.540 --> 20:07.120
We got incoming.

20:07.120 --> 20:10.670
Lieutenant Parker,
permission to approach.

20:13.250 --> 20:15.420
Hi.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.880
Teddy: I am right here,
Parker.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.960
We're in a hospital.
You're at Grey-Sloan.

20:18.960 --> 20:20.880
Hey.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.500
We're safe.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.380
Okay?

20:24.380 --> 20:26.460
You want to come with me
and we'll get you some help?

20:27.830 --> 20:30.210
Okay.
I got you.

20:30.210 --> 20:32.120
I got you. Yep.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.580
I got you.

20:33.580 --> 20:34.580
Here we go.

20:34.580 --> 20:36.120
It's alright.

20:39.790 --> 20:41.580
Oh.

20:41.580 --> 20:45.080
Dr. Altman, Elliott Calhoun's
heart started beating again.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.460
He's ready to
come off ECMO.

20:46.460 --> 20:48.080
Whoa.
Parker, what happened?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.580
He took a blow to the head
at Joe's.

20:49.580 --> 20:50.830
Did you get into
a bar fight?

20:50.830 --> 20:52.750
Amelia: There was an accident
at Joe's Bar.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.750
Casey and some of the residents
were there.

20:54.750 --> 20:57.790
We are taking him up to the ICU
to monitor his contusion.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.830
Damn it.
Grey needs me.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.580
It -- It's Schmitt.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:01.580 --> 21:02.920
Schmitt was there, too?
What the hell happened?

21:02.920 --> 21:04.330
Apparently,
it's cardiomyopathy.

21:04.330 --> 21:05.460
I need to meet them
in the cath lab.

21:05.460 --> 21:06.710
What about Elliott Calhoun?

21:06.710 --> 21:08.460
Alright, why don't you prep him?
Clear an O.R.

21:08.460 --> 21:09.710
I will go handle Schmitt,

21:09.710 --> 21:11.040
and then I'll join you
when I can.

21:11.040 --> 21:12.880
Page me with any updates
on Parker.

21:16.420 --> 21:19.620
The rash is just
a little erythema toxicum, so --

21:19.620 --> 21:22.250
But it's not remarkable.
Nothing to worry about.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.040
So I think we can bring in
social services

21:24.040 --> 21:26.250
for his placement.

21:26.250 --> 21:27.880
Shh.

21:29.460 --> 21:32.380
Maybe we can wait
for another couple of minutes.

21:32.380 --> 21:34.040
What do you think?

21:35.210 --> 21:36.290
Do you have kids?

21:36.290 --> 21:38.670
Yes. Two.

21:38.670 --> 21:41.790
Boys. Teenagers.

21:41.790 --> 21:44.380
Hellions.

21:44.380 --> 21:46.960
You?
No. No, not yet.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.580
I'm just volunteering.

21:48.580 --> 21:51.960
Oh, hello.

21:55.040 --> 21:58.880
I was in residency
when my boys were this age.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.170
All the pictures I have with
them, my eyes are half-closed.

22:03.170 --> 22:05.250
I love my boys,
but sometimes I think

22:05.250 --> 22:07.580
I probably missed
their perfect stage, you know?

22:07.580 --> 22:09.620
Yeah, he's pretty perfect.

22:09.620 --> 22:11.460
Don't know how you even
brought this guy in.

22:11.460 --> 22:13.120
I think I would've
stolen him.

22:24.000 --> 22:26.750
The subcostal incision
isn't enough.

22:26.750 --> 22:28.920
Uh, can you visualize
the IVC?

22:28.920 --> 22:30.210
I can't see from my side.

22:30.210 --> 22:32.250
Okay, we need
to extend up to a sternotomy

22:32.250 --> 22:34.040
to get better
visualization.

22:34.040 --> 22:35.920
Clamp the IVC
from all directions

22:35.920 --> 22:37.210
so I can isolate the bleed.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.080
You want to crack
her chest, too?

22:39.080 --> 22:40.670
No, but I don't want her
to die,

22:40.670 --> 22:42.040
and this is the only way
we can get control.

22:44.380 --> 22:45.710
You can do it
if you feel more comfortable.

22:46.670 --> 22:47.790
Scalpel.

22:51.290 --> 22:52.790
Get the saw ready.

23:12.250 --> 23:14.460
Okay.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.460
Very good alignment.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.250
Dr. Hunt,
the E.R. is asking

23:36.250 --> 23:38.000
if we can spare anyone
for an intake.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.330
Uh, Brody, we got this.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.330
But we haven't
closed the skin yet.

23:40.330 --> 23:43.080
Dr. Avery is perfectly capable
of doing it, so...

23:43.080 --> 23:44.500
Okay?

23:44.500 --> 23:46.540
Thanks, Brody.

23:46.540 --> 23:48.540
It's not her fault she didn't
know about you and Teddy.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.880
Listen,
I want to marry Teddy, okay?

23:55.880 --> 23:57.670
It's just complicated.
How's it complicated?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.210
I'm afraid.
That you'll screw
the whole thing up?

24:00.210 --> 24:01.960
I am afraid
it won't be big enough

24:01.960 --> 24:04.500
to make up for the fact
that I didn't do this sooner.

24:04.500 --> 24:07.120
And I'm not talking about

24:07.120 --> 24:08.790
the months
since Allison's been here.

24:08.790 --> 24:10.920
I'm talking about years,
decades.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.540
That is a lot of pressure.

24:12.540 --> 24:15.170
But pressure or not,
don't wait too long.

24:15.170 --> 24:17.580
If it's somebody you feel like
you want to be with forever,

24:17.580 --> 24:18.750
that should include now.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.790
What part of "updates
at every stage" was unclear?

24:24.790 --> 24:27.580
Well, you know how it is
when you're in the zone.

24:27.580 --> 24:30.710
Sometimes you just forget
everything else, right?

24:30.710 --> 24:33.120
Fractures are reduced.

24:33.120 --> 24:34.790
We're ready to reattach
the coronal flap.

24:34.790 --> 24:37.500
I mean, unless you want to check
my handiwork first.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.080
No need.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.710
Alright.
We're ready for closure.

24:40.710 --> 24:41.580
4-0 Vicryl, please.

24:42.790 --> 24:44.830
Whoa. Wait, Avery.

24:44.830 --> 24:46.290
Koracick, look.

24:46.290 --> 24:49.290
There is clear fluid
around the blood. Look.

24:49.290 --> 24:51.830
CSF fluid's leaking
from his brain, damn it.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.330
You said
scans didn't indicate --
Well, it doesn't matter
now, does it?

24:53.330 --> 24:54.620
I got to find the leak
and seal it.

24:54.620 --> 24:56.000
I said updates every stage.

24:56.000 --> 24:57.830
If I hadn't shown up,
he'd be dead on your table.

24:57.830 --> 25:01.040
Suture scissors.

25:08.670 --> 25:10.500
Now, when I clamp
the intrapericardial IVC,

25:10.500 --> 25:11.750
she'll flatline,

25:11.750 --> 25:13.170
and then I have about a minute
to find the bleeding.

25:13.170 --> 25:15.000
You'll have
less than a minute.

25:16.080 --> 25:17.500
Alright, on my count.

25:17.500 --> 25:21.000
1, 2...

25:21.000 --> 25:22.120
3.

25:23.330 --> 25:25.120
Starting cardiac massage.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.670
Oh, man, I still can't see it.
It's too much blood.

25:27.670 --> 25:29.040
Suction.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.290
Do not die.
Do you hear me?

25:31.290 --> 25:34.210
You are not dying.
You are not dying today.

25:34.210 --> 25:35.330
Okay.
I will not let you.

25:35.330 --> 25:36.620
No one is dying.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.380
Ah, okay. There, there, there.
I found it.

25:38.380 --> 25:40.920
Okay. 6-0 Prolene.
Okay, Richard, seconds.

25:40.920 --> 25:42.620
Okay,
I'm repairing the IVC.

25:42.620 --> 25:44.040
Hold it.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.460
Richard.
Hold on.

25:45.460 --> 25:46.960
We're gonna lose her!

25:46.960 --> 25:48.210
Got it.
I'm releasing the clamp.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.920
Good.

25:51.170 --> 25:52.540
Okay.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.080
Okay.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.620
Come on, come on.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.540
Ah!

25:58.540 --> 26:00.290
Ah.

26:00.290 --> 26:01.790
She's back.

26:03.790 --> 26:04.960
-Great job, doctors.
-Alright.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.420
-Ah!
-Alright!

26:08.540 --> 26:12.210
Okay. Okay. Okay.

26:12.210 --> 26:15.380
You should so hate me
right now.

26:15.380 --> 26:17.080
Schmitt, try and relax.

26:17.080 --> 26:21.170
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:21.170 --> 26:22.080
Schmitt!

26:23.750 --> 26:25.670
I forgive you.

26:25.670 --> 26:27.710
I have my license.
I have my job.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.120
I forgive you.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.920
But I need you to be quiet
and stay still

26:30.920 --> 26:32.880
so Dr. Altman
can do her job.

26:32.880 --> 26:36.790
Okay.

26:36.790 --> 26:38.750
Dr. Altman, am I dying?

26:38.750 --> 26:40.710
No, it just felt like it.

26:40.710 --> 26:42.040
No blockages?

26:42.040 --> 26:43.830
No, he didn't have
a heart attack.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.830
It appears
from the echo and angio

26:45.830 --> 26:47.750
that he has
broken-heart syndrome.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.580
What's that?

26:49.580 --> 26:51.080
It's when you have the symptoms
of a heart attack --

26:51.080 --> 26:53.080
chest pain,
shortness of breath --

26:53.080 --> 26:54.790
but there's nothing wrong.

26:54.790 --> 26:56.580
It's rare.

26:56.580 --> 26:58.580
Comes from extreme stress.

26:58.580 --> 27:01.460
No. Schmitt's as cool
as a cucumber.

27:01.460 --> 27:04.000
No, I'm not. I'm the most
stressed-out person...

27:04.000 --> 27:05.790
Oh, you're kidding.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.250
I'm kidding.

27:07.250 --> 27:08.540

Linda said
they just closed,

monitoring him.

29:30.830 --> 29:32.710
She's optimistic,

29:32.710 --> 29:37.040
and, uh, his recovery
will take awhile.

29:37.040 --> 29:39.710
Anyone figure out
what happened to Schmitt?

29:39.710 --> 29:42.250
Heartbreak syndrome,
apparently.

29:42.250 --> 29:44.080
He'll need
a few weeks rest.

29:46.210 --> 29:47.290
Bailey, everyone's fine.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.710
Everyone.

29:52.710 --> 29:54.170
Everyone.

29:56.620 --> 29:58.880
Everyone I touched today,

29:58.880 --> 30:02.290
everyone I held in my hands

30:02.290 --> 30:06.000
or gave
to another surgeon

30:06.000 --> 30:08.540
to put back
together again,

30:08.540 --> 30:10.540
and fine.

30:11.880 --> 30:16.330
I lose you and Grey,

30:16.330 --> 30:18.880
Hunt, Karev,

30:18.880 --> 30:21.250
but I made that fine.

30:21.250 --> 30:23.380
I made that work.

30:26.500 --> 30:30.710
But this -- this...

30:30.710 --> 30:33.460
This  I...

30:35.830 --> 30:39.960
I am not fine.

30:42.960 --> 30:47.500
She isn't fine!

30:47.500 --> 30:53.460
And I can't even
hold her in my hands

30:53.460 --> 30:55.710
or put her
in someone else's hands

30:55.710 --> 30:57.420
who could put her
back together again.

30:57.420 --> 31:00.380
She just was!

31:00.380 --> 31:01.920
Oh, God.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.040
And now she isn't.

31:05.040 --> 31:10.420
And I can't do anything
but just stand here --

31:13.040 --> 31:17.380
Stand here and lose her.

31:51.120 --> 31:55.040
Levi:

32:04.250 --> 32:05.540
Hey.

32:05.540 --> 32:06.790
Hey.

32:06.790 --> 32:08.620
My heart was broken.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.040
Mine too.

32:13.880 --> 32:15.540
Taryn's out of surgery.

32:15.540 --> 32:17.790
She's okay.

32:17.790 --> 32:20.250
Can I go see her?
Yeah.

32:20.250 --> 32:22.120
In a minute.

32:37.750 --> 32:40.290
He did have facial fractures
we were able to fix,

32:40.290 --> 32:43.120
and then we discovered he had
fluid leaking from his brain,

32:43.120 --> 32:44.500
but Dr. Koracick
was able to get in there

32:44.500 --> 32:46.080
and patch up the leak.

32:46.080 --> 32:47.750
Dr. Tommy
operated on him?

32:47.750 --> 32:49.920
Dr. Tommy is...?

32:49.920 --> 32:51.620
Tommy. Koracick.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.500
Oh.
Oh.

32:53.500 --> 32:55.250
Yeah. Yes.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.880
Well, he's our angel.

32:56.880 --> 32:58.580
When he offered Blake the job
to come out here,

32:58.580 --> 32:59.750
Blake said no.

32:59.750 --> 33:00.920
He didn't want
to leave me behind.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.790
It's...

33:02.790 --> 33:05.790
It's just been the two of us
since his parents died.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.040
But Dr. Tommy
wanted him badly enough

33:08.040 --> 33:09.750
he paid for me
to move to Seattle.

33:09.750 --> 33:12.420
I know he must be beating
himself up that this happened.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.330
I told him that it was
a freak accident,

33:15.330 --> 33:17.750
but you -- you know
how emotional he is.

33:19.540 --> 33:20.960
Koracick.
Of course, yeah.

33:20.960 --> 33:23.210
Mm-hmm.
Yeah,
s-super emotional guy.

33:23.210 --> 33:25.920
So, um,
will Blake be okay?

33:25.920 --> 33:28.000
There is
a slow recovery.

33:28.000 --> 33:30.710
His trach should come out
in a day or two.

33:30.710 --> 33:32.620
As long as everything
goes well --
Koracick: Lorraine?

33:32.620 --> 33:34.380
Are these two men
bothering you?

33:34.380 --> 33:36.210
No, not at all.

33:36.210 --> 33:37.790
Um, can I go
in the room?

33:37.790 --> 33:39.290
Absolutely.
Okay.

33:39.290 --> 33:41.380
Dr. Avery,
lead the way.

33:41.380 --> 33:42.790
Of course, yeah.

33:47.670 --> 33:49.880
Hunt.
Mm-hmm.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.420
That CSF leak,
that was a great catch.

to take time.

40:31.710 --> 40:34.040

40:37.210 --> 40:39.120

40:39.120 --> 40:42.540

asking her to take time

40:42.540 --> 40:44.210
might've had
the opposite effect.

40:44.210 --> 40:45.580
You hurt someone

40:45.580 --> 40:47.620
who's had more than enough hurt

Who's Sabrina Webber?

41:13.420 --> 41:16.080
My cousin.

41:24.040 --> 41:27.120
But if you're going to make
a life of this,

41:27.120 --> 41:30.580
you need to learn to rely on
others whenever possible.

41:30.580 --> 41:32.000
Get in here.

41:42.710 --> 41:44.670

41:59.960 --> 42:01.960
And that if you break,

42:01.960 --> 42:05.210
it's okay to let your friends
put you back together.
