00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:18.172 --> 00:19.862
You know you're supposed
to aim for the board right?

00:19.862 --> 00:21.379
Out of practice.

00:21.379 --> 00:23.931
You don't get a lot of chances
to do this in the joint.

00:24.931 --> 00:26.310
<i>♪You spend half of
your life asleep ♪</i>

00:26.310 --> 00:27.517
That was lucky.

00:28.344 --> 00:30.034
I've got to go answer
the call of nature.

00:31.344 --> 00:33.551
<i>♪Be nice to
everybody you meet ♪</i>

00:36.275 --> 00:38.034
<i>♪Until you're dead</i>

00:38.034 --> 00:40.344
You got a phone
I can use?

00:40.344 --> 00:41.758
You haven't
got a cell, love?

00:41.758 --> 00:43.862
If I did would
I be asking?

00:45.344 --> 00:46.241
Here you go.

00:46.241 --> 00:49.275
<i>♪And after all
the time it takes ♪</i>

00:59.241 --> 01:00.793
You go back
to bed pal.

01:06.206 --> 01:07.344
Hudson.

01:07.344 --> 01:08.896
<i>Took you
long enough.</i>

01:08.896 --> 01:10.310
<i>I was about
to hang up.</i>

01:11.448 --> 01:13.793
<i>Hope I didn't interrupt your
beauty sleep, Detective.</i>

01:13.793 --> 01:17.103
<i>I figured you'd want to
get this call at any hour.</i>

01:17.103 --> 01:17.965
Bertrand?

01:17.965 --> 01:19.862
Trust me.

01:19.862 --> 01:22.379
I'm as surprised to be calling
as you are to hear from me.

01:22.379 --> 01:23.965
Does this mean you're
finally going to tell me

01:23.965 --> 01:26.034
what you know about the
disappearance of Alison Anders?

01:26.034 --> 01:28.310
<i>Means I finally got
something to tell you.</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:30.482
I'm listening.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.206
No.

01:32.206 --> 01:33.517
Come see me.

01:36.068 --> 01:36.931
Bertrand.

01:38.103 --> 01:40.379
If this is some
kind of joke-

01:40.379 --> 01:42.241
Like you told me.

01:42.241 --> 01:44.310
This is my last chance
to make things right.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.482
Same place we
met last time.

02:04.965 --> 02:05.655
Hey Charlie.

02:05.655 --> 02:07.034
Last call's done.

02:07.034 --> 02:08.413
Rita, I'm looking for
a man named Bertrand.

02:08.413 --> 02:09.103
Who?

02:09.103 --> 02:10.103
He's an older guy.

02:10.103 --> 02:10.827
Has an oxygen tank.

02:10.827 --> 02:11.586
<i>Oh.</i>

02:11.586 --> 02:12.896
Out back having
his last smoke

02:12.896 --> 02:14.137
<i>I'd imagine.</i>

02:14.137 --> 02:15.827
<i>Do me a favour and ask him
to come in and settle up.</i>

02:15.827 --> 02:16.655
Would you Charlie?

02:16.655 --> 02:18.000
Yeah.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.413
Thank you.

02:46.827 --> 02:48.344
106 Harrison Street.

03:10.275 --> 03:11.172
SJPD!

03:11.172 --> 03:12.206
Rex.

03:35.862 --> 03:37.241
What?

04:13.517 --> 04:15.172
<i>Oh no, Alison.</i>

04:23.724 --> 04:25.172
You shouldn't have gone
there on your own.

04:26.310 --> 04:28.448
I thought there was
an imminent danger.

04:28.448 --> 04:29.241
I was wrong.

04:29.241 --> 04:30.655
Danger had long passed.

04:30.655 --> 04:33.000
The people that I've been
trying to track are dead.

04:34.103 --> 04:35.379
I wouldn't be so
sure about that.

04:40.172 --> 04:42.724
<i>That's Karma's preliminary
report on human remains.</i>

04:49.344 --> 04:50.344
It's not Alison.

04:50.862 --> 04:52.000
<i>It's an adult female.</i>

04:52.000 --> 04:54.344
Approximately
forty years of age.

04:55.206 --> 04:56.965
Dolly Miles?

04:56.965 --> 04:58.344
<i>Karma's still looking
into the dental records.</i>

04:58.344 --> 04:59.586
But-

05:00.965 --> 05:02.586
we found Alison's
fingerprints

05:02.586 --> 05:04.344
<i>in the house.</i>

05:09.827 --> 05:10.965
That means she's alive.

05:12.137 --> 05:14.793
I'm liking the odds a lot
better than I did yesterday.

05:16.310 --> 05:16.965
What do we know

05:16.965 --> 05:18.448
<i>about Bertrand's death?</i>

05:18.448 --> 05:19.862
Karma's looking into it.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.275
But Charlie, I pushed this
right to the front of the line.

05:26.344 --> 05:27.034
<i>I'm sorry ma'am.</i>

05:27.034 --> 05:28.034
<i>I can't let
you through.</i>

05:28.034 --> 05:29.689
<i>You've got to
tell me something.</i>

05:29.689 --> 05:30.379
<i>Come on!</i>

05:30.379 --> 05:31.206
<i>As if I care!</i>

05:31.206 --> 05:32.137
<i>I can't
let you through.</i>

05:32.137 --> 05:32.793
<i>I'm sorry okay?</i>

05:32.793 --> 05:34.103
<i>It's a crime scene.</i>

05:34.103 --> 05:34.758
Excuse me!

05:34.758 --> 05:35.965
<i>Ma'am, please.</i>

05:36.068 --> 05:37.103
<i>Excuse me!</i>

05:37.103 --> 05:38.241
<i>Are you in charge?</i>

05:39.275 --> 05:40.137
Detective Hudson.

05:40.137 --> 05:40.896
What happened?

05:40.896 --> 05:42.586
They won't tell
me anything!

05:42.586 --> 05:43.896
You know the people
that live here?

05:43.896 --> 05:44.724
Yeah!

05:44.724 --> 05:45.965
Are they all right?

05:45.965 --> 05:47.034
What do you
know about them?

05:47.034 --> 05:50.206
Bob Lowther and
his daughter Allie.

05:50.206 --> 05:51.931
<i>Are they all right?</i>

05:53.275 --> 05:54.275
They're missing.

05:54.275 --> 05:55.689
When was the last
time you saw them?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.103
Two-

05:57.103 --> 05:58.793
Maybe three days ago.

05:58.793 --> 05:59.724
What's going on?

05:59.724 --> 06:00.827
I need to
locate them.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.448
You have any idea where
they might have gone?

06:02.448 --> 06:05.448
Might be at their
cabin I suppose?

06:06.413 --> 06:07.862
Cabin?

06:07.862 --> 06:08.517
Where?

06:08.517 --> 06:09.965
I don't know.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.034
Bob was
always going on

06:11.034 --> 06:12.689
about building
a safe place-

06:12.689 --> 06:14.137
or whatever
that means.

06:16.275 --> 06:17.000
Thanks.

06:18.000 --> 06:18.655
Wait wait.

06:18.655 --> 06:20.172
Wait a sec.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.448
What were they like?

06:21.448 --> 06:23.689
Allie was lovely.

06:23.689 --> 06:24.448
Bob-

06:24.448 --> 06:26.172
Well he got a
little strange

06:26.172 --> 06:28.517
after his wife died
a couple years ago.

06:41.241 --> 06:43.517
So you believe
she's still alive?

06:44.482 --> 06:46.379
I'm hopeful, Fiona-

06:46.379 --> 06:47.896
based on the
neighbour's information.

06:49.551 --> 06:52.344
All this time, she's been
here in town, under our noses?

06:52.344 --> 06:53.862
No, I don't
think so.

06:53.862 --> 06:56.344
I think that Trevor
and Dolly left town

06:56.344 --> 06:57.689
as soon as
they took Alison.

06:57.689 --> 07:00.827
And they just recently returned
under assumed names.

07:00.931 --> 07:02.068
Wow.

07:02.586 --> 07:04.275
We've missed
so many years.

07:06.172 --> 07:07.586
And you're sure
there's no mistake?

07:07.586 --> 07:09.689
This is my Alison?

07:09.689 --> 07:11.448
We found this
at the house.

07:14.448 --> 07:15.448
<i>Technically it's evidence.</i>

07:15.448 --> 07:16.931
<i>But forensics said</i>

07:16.931 --> 07:18.344
that they got everything
they need from it.

07:18.344 --> 07:19.931
And I want
you to have it.

07:19.931 --> 07:21.620
This was hers!

07:21.620 --> 07:22.586
Can I- ?

07:22.586 --> 07:23.551
Yeah.

07:29.344 --> 07:30.310
<i>Chloe.</i>

07:31.241 --> 07:33.241
People told me
to give up hope.

07:42.344 --> 07:44.344
Thank you Charlie.

07:44.344 --> 07:45.862
I know you'll
bring Alison home.

07:45.862 --> 07:47.655
Just like you promised.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.241
<i>Jesse.</i>

07:57.241 --> 07:59.620
I need you to run a full
search on Bob Lowther.

07:59.620 --> 08:00.862
Trevor Miles's alias.

08:00.862 --> 08:03.551
Of all the names you could
choose from, he goes with Bob?

08:03.551 --> 08:04.655
Charlie.

08:04.655 --> 08:05.586
You get anything?

08:05.586 --> 08:06.758
Yeah.

08:06.758 --> 08:09.137
A neighbour said they saw
Bob and his daughter Allie

08:09.137 --> 08:10.413
less than
three days ago.

08:10.413 --> 08:11.137
<i>Well that's something.</i>

08:11.137 --> 08:11.827
Yeah.

08:11.931 --> 08:12.655
Yeah.

08:12.655 --> 08:13.655
Hey.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.551
Hey did you
get anything?

08:15.551 --> 08:16.758
Karma's autopsy report

08:16.758 --> 08:17.620
<i>on Bertrand Boyle.</i>

08:17.620 --> 08:18.310
Okay.

08:18.310 --> 08:19.620
What am I
looking at here?

08:19.620 --> 08:21.172
<i>He died from
a blow to the head.</i>

08:21.172 --> 08:22.068
<i>His oxygen tank</i>

08:22.068 --> 08:23.275
was likely the weapon.

08:23.275 --> 08:24.172
Any prints?

08:24.172 --> 08:25.586
No, wiped clean.

08:25.586 --> 08:26.793
You think it's
Trevor Miles?

08:26.793 --> 08:28.103
Yeah, stands to reason.

08:28.103 --> 08:30.000
But why kill
Bertrand now?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.827
Well I think Bertrand's
been telling the truth

08:31.827 --> 08:32.758
all these years.

08:32.758 --> 08:34.103
Hasn't known where
Trevor Miles is.

08:34.103 --> 08:36.000
<i>But he called me.</i>

08:36.000 --> 08:37.206
<i>He said that he had
new information.</i>

08:37.206 --> 08:38.862
Maybe he found Trevor.

08:38.862 --> 08:40.517
Maybe Trevor tried
to shut him up.

08:40.517 --> 08:41.758
Guys, I got something.

08:41.758 --> 08:42.793
What is it?

08:42.793 --> 08:43.758
Two months ago-

08:43.758 --> 08:45.965
<i>Bob Lowther,
AKA Trevor Miles-</i>

08:45.965 --> 08:46.827
bought ten
acres of land

08:46.827 --> 08:47.931
<i>just outside of town.</i>

08:47.931 --> 08:48.931
Jesse.

08:48.931 --> 08:49.586
You're a legend.

08:49.586 --> 08:50.931
Send me that address.

08:50.931 --> 08:51.965
<i>Come on pal.</i>

09:06.206 --> 09:08.000
You got something?

09:18.344 --> 09:19.241
<i>Alison.</i>

09:20.103 --> 09:20.965
Get away from me!

09:21.724 --> 09:22.655
Easy pal.

09:22.655 --> 09:23.344
Easy.

09:23.344 --> 09:24.724
I said stay back!

09:25.551 --> 09:26.724
I'm here to
help okay?

09:26.724 --> 09:28.344
Help how?

09:28.344 --> 09:29.827
I'm a police detective.

09:31.655 --> 09:32.448
Rex!

09:56.034 --> 09:57.689
Help help!

10:04.862 --> 10:05.482
<i>No no!</i>

10:05.482 --> 10:06.172
Stay back!

10:06.172 --> 10:06.827
Okay, easy.

10:06.827 --> 10:07.965
<i>My name is Charlie.</i>

10:07.965 --> 10:08.965
<i>I'm just
here to help.</i>

10:08.965 --> 10:10.551
We're going to get your
leg out of this trap.

10:10.551 --> 10:11.241
That okay?

10:11.241 --> 10:12.103
Can we start
with that?

10:12.103 --> 10:12.793
Yeah.

10:12.793 --> 10:14.000
Okay.

10:14.000 --> 10:14.689
Rex.

10:16.241 --> 10:17.241
You can take
pressure off it.

10:17.241 --> 10:18.275
I'm going to
open this up.

10:18.275 --> 10:19.689
You're going to pull
your leg out, yeah?

10:25.896 --> 10:26.724
Come on.

10:36.172 --> 10:37.379
Is that Dewey?

10:38.379 --> 10:39.034
Dewey?

10:39.034 --> 10:40.000
Your old dog.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.034
Yeah!

10:41.034 --> 10:43.344
He ran away
years ago.

10:43.344 --> 10:44.172
No no.

10:44.172 --> 10:45.172
This is Rex.

10:46.551 --> 10:47.344
Sure looks like Dewey.

10:47.344 --> 10:48.034
Oh!

10:48.793 --> 10:49.689
<i>Hey, easy.</i>

10:49.689 --> 10:51.103
We've got to take
a look at that leg.

10:51.103 --> 10:51.965
No, I'm fine.

10:51.965 --> 10:52.655
Just go!

10:52.655 --> 10:53.655
I'm not going
to do that.

10:53.655 --> 10:54.724
You need to
see a doctor.

10:54.724 --> 10:55.724
No, no doctors!

10:55.724 --> 10:58.000
Rex is going to
come with us okay?

11:00.413 --> 11:01.448
Right pal?

11:01.448 --> 11:02.896
He's not going to let
anything happen to you.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.448
I promise.

11:07.344 --> 11:08.862
Okay, give me your-

11:10.655 --> 11:11.586
Easy.

11:22.034 --> 11:23.103
<i>Okay, that's
good to know.</i>

11:23.103 --> 11:24.034
<i>Thank you.</i>

11:25.103 --> 11:27.137
How is she?

11:27.137 --> 11:28.551
Her leg is
going to be fine.

11:29.793 --> 11:30.551
But-?

11:30.551 --> 11:32.758
Well no buts really.

11:32.758 --> 11:34.689
She's in good health.

11:34.689 --> 11:37.068
No signs of abuse or
mistreatment of any sort.

11:37.068 --> 11:39.379
Okay, that's a relief-

11:39.379 --> 11:40.862
you know,
given the situation.

11:40.862 --> 11:44.310
I mean, we both know
how these cases usually go.

11:45.344 --> 11:46.413
Yeah.

11:47.379 --> 11:48.655
What is it?

11:50.103 --> 11:51.586
She did refuse
a tetanus shot.

11:51.586 --> 11:52.620
She screamed
at the doctor

11:52.620 --> 11:54.448
and said that he was
trying to poison her.

11:57.310 --> 12:00.103
Well the abductor could have
kept her away from doctors

12:00.103 --> 12:00.896
to prevent detection.

12:01.758 --> 12:02.965
<i>Have you talked
to her yet?</i>

12:02.965 --> 12:04.551
Not since
she's been here.

12:05.206 --> 12:06.034
Do you
want me to?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.344
No I'm
going to try.

12:09.827 --> 12:10.482
Charlie.

12:12.206 --> 12:13.965
She might be more
open talking to me.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.241
Let's see how I
do first, all right?

12:16.724 --> 12:17.655
Okay.

12:17.655 --> 12:19.137
If you need me-

12:20.758 --> 12:21.793
Thanks.

12:22.758 --> 12:23.689
Rex.

12:31.689 --> 12:32.448
Hey.

12:32.448 --> 12:34.517
<i>Can we talk?</i>

12:34.517 --> 12:36.068
Just for a minute.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.931
Sounds like he wants to
get up there with you.

12:39.931 --> 12:40.620
That okay?

12:44.172 --> 12:45.206
<i>Watch her leg pal.</i>

12:45.206 --> 12:45.896
<i>It's okay.</i>

12:45.896 --> 12:47.000
<i>It's better.</i>

12:50.000 --> 12:51.310
<i>Well he likes you.</i>

12:52.689 --> 12:54.896
<i>He's been helping
me look for you-</i>

12:54.896 --> 12:56.413
<i>for a long time.</i>

12:56.413 --> 12:57.206
Look for me?

12:57.206 --> 12:58.068
Why?

12:59.655 --> 13:01.000
Well we were
worried about you.

13:02.413 --> 13:03.724
Why would you be
worried about me?

13:03.724 --> 13:04.965
I was with my
mom and dad.

13:09.517 --> 13:10.310
Are these two people-

13:10.310 --> 13:13.379
are they your
mom and dad?

13:16.172 --> 13:17.620
Yeah.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.310
Where are
they now?

13:25.620 --> 13:26.793
Mom died.

13:27.586 --> 13:29.310
It's just me
and Dad now.

13:32.965 --> 13:34.000
Where's he?

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Why do you
want to know?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.068
<i>My daughter
is in there!</i>

13:38.068 --> 13:39.448
<i>Ms. Anders,
you can't go in there!</i>

13:39.448 --> 13:40.517
<i>It's been
fourteen years!</i>

13:40.517 --> 13:41.793
And I won't
be kept from-

13:41.793 --> 13:42.965
<i>Charlie I
tried to stop her!</i>

13:42.965 --> 13:43.655
<i>There she is!</i>

13:44.586 --> 13:45.379
<i>I've missed
you so much!</i>

13:46.206 --> 13:47.034
Fiona, let's talk
outside please.

13:47.724 --> 13:48.482
Please Charlie!

13:49.241 --> 13:50.724
I need to kiss
my baby girl!

13:50.724 --> 13:51.379
Who is that?

13:51.379 --> 13:52.068
<i>Fiona.</i>

13:52.068 --> 13:53.310
It's me!

13:54.275 --> 13:55.620
It's your momma!

13:57.862 --> 13:59.103
You-

13:59.103 --> 14:01.103
you are not
my mom!

14:03.655 --> 14:05.103
Okay get her
out of here!

14:05.103 --> 14:06.034
Hey all right.

14:06.034 --> 14:06.931
Okay.

14:07.275 --> 14:07.931
Sarah.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.551
Ms. Anders, let's go.

14:09.793 --> 14:10.793
She doesn't remember me?

14:10.793 --> 14:11.448
I know.

14:11.448 --> 14:12.413
Come on.

14:12.413 --> 14:14.103
<i>How could she
not remember me?</i>

14:18.896 --> 14:19.965
You okay?

14:20.689 --> 14:22.724
Just keep that
lady away from me.

14:24.310 --> 14:25.517
Rex, stay.

14:28.310 --> 14:30.310
I've accepted that
we'd never find her.

14:30.310 --> 14:33.034
But to find her-

14:33.034 --> 14:35.379
only to have her
not remember me?

14:39.758 --> 14:41.827
It's too much.

14:41.827 --> 14:42.586
<i>Imagine-</i>

14:42.586 --> 14:45.482
how confused
Alison must be.

14:45.482 --> 14:48.000
She's been told for
fourteen years

14:48.000 --> 14:50.103
that she was
somebody else.

14:51.344 --> 14:53.379
Did they hurt her?

14:53.379 --> 14:54.620
<i>No.</i>

14:54.620 --> 14:57.655
No, by all accounts
she was well cared for.

15:01.241 --> 15:02.206
What happens now?

15:02.206 --> 15:04.482
<i>She's agreed
to stay overnight</i>

15:04.482 --> 15:06.137
so the doctor
can watch her.

15:07.862 --> 15:08.758
And then what?

15:09.827 --> 15:10.793
I don't know.

15:11.482 --> 15:12.655
What are you saying?

15:12.655 --> 15:14.482
She's almost
of legal age.

15:14.482 --> 15:17.344
The decision will
likely be hers.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.034
But that's crazy!

15:22.034 --> 15:24.000
She doesn't even
know who she is!

15:25.931 --> 15:27.103
I know this
is tough.

15:27.103 --> 15:28.551
But-

15:28.551 --> 15:31.034
she did remember
some things.

15:31.034 --> 15:32.896
She remembered when she
was little that she had a dog.

15:32.896 --> 15:34.448
She called Rex <i>Dewey</i>.

15:34.448 --> 15:36.517
Yeah, that was the
name of our shepherd.

15:36.517 --> 15:37.965
Yeah.

15:37.965 --> 15:39.379
So she remembers
the dog.

15:39.379 --> 15:41.517
But she doesn't
remember me?

15:43.379 --> 15:44.068
<i>Hang in there.</i>

15:45.068 --> 15:46.103
<i>Okay?</i>

15:47.206 --> 15:48.586
Your daughter's
still in there.

15:49.620 --> 15:52.137
If anyone can get
her back, it's Rex.

16:00.344 --> 16:01.034
Hey.

16:01.137 --> 16:02.379
Hey it's the man
of the hour!

16:02.379 --> 16:03.310
No no, not yet.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.034
<i>Jesse, Jesse.</i>

16:05.689 --> 16:07.689
Hey Charlie.

16:07.689 --> 16:09.172
I know that Trevor's
in the wind.

16:09.172 --> 16:11.620
But you've
got to know

16:11.620 --> 16:14.103
that you've earned
the right to take a beat

16:14.103 --> 16:15.965
and celebrate the win.

16:15.965 --> 16:18.241
Finding Alison after
all these years is-

16:18.241 --> 16:19.413
it's huge.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.793
Okay what is it?

16:23.793 --> 16:25.586
She doesn't
recognize her mother.

16:25.586 --> 16:28.862
She thinks that Trevor
and Dolly are her parents.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.379
Trevor didn't
steal her childhood.

16:30.379 --> 16:31.793
He stole
who she is.

16:31.793 --> 16:33.137
I hear you.

16:33.137 --> 16:34.206
Believe me,
I hear you Charlie.

16:34.206 --> 16:35.103
But you've
got to know-

16:35.103 --> 16:36.551
I have every single
cop on this force

16:36.551 --> 16:37.413
out there
looking for them.

16:37.413 --> 16:38.241
Yeah okay.

16:38.241 --> 16:39.931
Jesse how about
the tip line huh?

16:40.620 --> 16:41.586
Trevor's photo's gone wide.

16:41.586 --> 16:42.275
But no hits.

16:42.275 --> 16:43.103
Okay.

16:43.103 --> 16:44.379
I'm going to head
back to the bar.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.655
I'm going to see if I can tie
Trevor to Bertrand's death yeah?

16:47.482 --> 16:48.379
Rex.

16:50.206 --> 16:52.275
I've never seen
Charlie like this before.

16:52.275 --> 16:53.068
Yeah.

16:54.068 --> 16:55.413
Every cop has
that one case.

16:55.413 --> 16:56.344
But this-

16:57.758 --> 16:58.827
This one's his.

17:05.275 --> 17:06.586
Hey Rita, you
got a second?

17:06.586 --> 17:07.620
Hey!

17:08.000 --> 17:09.655
So I wanted to ask
you a couple of questions

17:09.655 --> 17:11.068
about Bertrand's death.

17:11.068 --> 17:13.931
Well I was in here tending
bar the whole time.

17:13.931 --> 17:15.137
And that poor sod-

17:15.137 --> 17:17.344
he looked like he was
on his last legs anyway.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.241
Well I think someone

17:18.241 --> 17:19.517
<i>may have helped
him on the way out.</i>

17:19.517 --> 17:20.620
<i>Was he with anyone?</i>

17:20.620 --> 17:21.931
Sure, he was over there
playing darts with some guy.

17:21.931 --> 17:23.137
<i>♪Money never meant
that much to me ♪</i>

17:23.137 --> 17:23.793
Were they friendly?

17:23.793 --> 17:25.000
Were they unfriendly?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.379
<i>Who's to say Charlie?</i>

17:26.379 --> 17:27.137
They were playing darts.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.896
Was it this guy?

17:28.896 --> 17:29.551
<i>♪Unless there's tonnes</i>

17:29.551 --> 17:30.275
Yeah.

17:30.275 --> 17:31.206
<i>A bit older now.</i>

17:32.137 --> 17:33.586
<i>♪and still all these
mouths to feed ♪</i>

17:33.586 --> 17:34.620
Thanks.
<i>- No worries.</i>

17:34.620 --> 17:35.517
<i>♪That's just greed</i>

17:35.517 --> 17:36.482
Yeah, Hudson.

17:36.482 --> 17:37.586
<i>This is North
Shore Hospital.</i>

17:37.586 --> 17:38.344
Yeah?

17:38.344 --> 17:39.137
<i>We have a
situation here.</i>

17:39.137 --> 17:39.793
On my way.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.034
Come on pal.

17:44.758 --> 17:45.896
Nurse [on PA]: <i>Dr. Vernon.</i>

17:45.896 --> 17:47.586
<i>Please report to Pharmacy.</i>

17:47.586 --> 17:48.793
What happened?

17:48.793 --> 17:49.793
She hit me!

17:49.793 --> 17:51.586
I was just trying
to do bloodwork!

18:01.068 --> 18:02.206
Alison?

18:04.241 --> 18:05.344
Allie.

18:06.482 --> 18:07.724
It's Charlie and Rex.

18:10.413 --> 18:11.793
Leave me alone!

18:11.793 --> 18:14.103
Just leave me alone!

18:15.241 --> 18:16.000
Alison!

18:16.000 --> 18:17.137
Can you let
me in please?

18:18.206 --> 18:19.206
Nurse [on PA]:
<i>Dr. Simmons.</i>

18:19.206 --> 18:20.103
<i>You have an
emergency call.</i>

18:35.586 --> 18:36.413
Good job pal.

18:36.413 --> 18:37.137
Go.

18:53.172 --> 18:53.862
<i>Oh!</i>

18:53.862 --> 18:55.413
<i>What are you
doing here?</i>

18:55.413 --> 18:58.000
Alison, I sent Rex in to
make sure that you're okay.

19:04.103 --> 19:06.482
You're not coming in here
to stick any needles in me!

19:06.482 --> 19:08.241
Nobody's going to
stick any needles in you.

19:08.241 --> 19:09.793
I'm not going
to let the nurses

19:09.793 --> 19:11.172
do any tests that
you don't want.

19:12.413 --> 19:14.758
Can you
let me in?

19:29.310 --> 19:31.206
I just want
to go home.

19:35.172 --> 19:37.689
You know,
everyone that's here-

19:37.689 --> 19:39.413
they're trying
to help you.

19:39.413 --> 19:41.137
<i>I can't stay
here, all right?</i>

19:41.137 --> 19:42.068
I do that-

19:42.068 --> 19:43.206
they're going to start
experiments on me.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.827
Put a chip in
me or something.

19:45.862 --> 19:46.965
They're not
going to do that.

19:46.965 --> 19:47.862
You don't know.

19:47.862 --> 19:49.448
I need to get
back to the clean air.

19:49.448 --> 19:51.275
The air is
clean in here.

19:51.931 --> 19:52.931
I assure you.

19:54.206 --> 19:56.620
There's been a big spike in
airborne toxins and diseases.

19:56.620 --> 19:57.827
It's one of the
warning signs.

19:57.827 --> 20:00.310
I just want to go
home to my dad.

20:00.310 --> 20:02.965
<i>When is the last time
you saw your dad?</i>

20:02.965 --> 20:04.034
A couple of days.

20:04.034 --> 20:05.137
He left to
get supplies.

20:05.344 --> 20:06.379
Well I need
to find him.

20:06.379 --> 20:08.137
Do you have any idea
where he might be going?

20:09.793 --> 20:11.517
Was he meeting anybody?

20:11.517 --> 20:12.620
The name Bertrand Boyle-

20:12.620 --> 20:14.000
<i>Does that mean
anything to you?</i>

20:14.000 --> 20:15.620
No, who's that?

20:17.241 --> 20:18.931
He was seen with
your father yesterday-

20:20.000 --> 20:21.586
right before we
found Bertrand dead.

20:23.551 --> 20:25.241
Okay my dad had
nothing to do with that!

20:25.241 --> 20:26.482
I'm not saying
that he did.

20:26.482 --> 20:28.689
I still need to talk
to him to be sure.

20:30.310 --> 20:32.172
This is just what he
said would happen.

20:32.172 --> 20:34.379
Okay one day the police
would come up with some lie

20:34.379 --> 20:35.310
to pull us
from safety

20:35.310 --> 20:37.206
right before the cataclysm.

20:39.137 --> 20:41.000
I need to
go home!

20:54.000 --> 20:55.000
Charlie, hey.

20:55.000 --> 20:56.034
<i>How's Alison?</i>

20:57.758 --> 20:58.862
I need you to
poke around

20:58.862 --> 21:00.793
the conspiracy corners
of the web for me.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.413
Okay, I mean it's
not so much a corner

21:02.413 --> 21:03.482
as it is the
entire Internet.

21:03.482 --> 21:04.586
You want to be
more specific?

21:04.586 --> 21:06.275
Paranoid about
medical experiments-

21:06.275 --> 21:07.275
chemicals in her food.

21:08.000 --> 21:10.103
<i>Mentioned something
about a cataclysm.</i>

21:10.103 --> 21:13.206
Sounds like she and
Trevor might be preppers.

21:13.206 --> 21:15.448
<i>Is that people who
prepare for the doomsday?</i>

21:15.448 --> 21:16.724
Is that a
religious thing?

21:16.724 --> 21:18.103
<i>Well it depends
who you ask.</i>

21:18.103 --> 21:20.724
But anyone obsessed with
judgement day, nuclear strikes-

21:20.724 --> 21:21.620
societal collapse.

21:21.620 --> 21:23.896
<i>The house that
we found Alison in</i>

21:23.896 --> 21:25.068
was stockpiled with food.

21:25.068 --> 21:26.482
Maybe we can link
Trevor to this group-

21:26.482 --> 21:28.206
<i>if they're organized
here in town.</i>

21:28.206 --> 21:29.275
<i>Okay okay.</i>

21:29.275 --> 21:30.827
If I can narrow down
what they're involved in.

21:30.827 --> 21:32.103
But I mean look.

21:32.103 --> 21:34.034
Trying to separate different
types of crazy on the internet

21:34.034 --> 21:35.896
is like trying to find
a needle in a haystack.

21:36.379 --> 21:38.000
Just find me
something, Jesse.

21:40.517 --> 21:41.758
This is going
to take a while.

21:42.655 --> 21:43.586
Joe, hey.

21:43.586 --> 21:44.758
We might have a
lead on Trevor.

21:44.758 --> 21:45.862
But um-

21:45.862 --> 21:46.862
I could
use a hand.

21:57.551 --> 21:58.620
What do you want?

21:59.379 --> 22:01.103
You want to get
some clean air?

22:04.551 --> 22:05.482
Okay.

22:05.482 --> 22:08.034
I have a <i>Book
of Revelations</i>-

22:08.034 --> 22:10.448
<i>10 signs from Newfoundland
That It's Already Here.</i>

22:11.344 --> 22:12.344
Okay, here's one.

22:12.344 --> 22:14.241
Anti-Authoritarian
Truth Brigade.

22:14.241 --> 22:15.827
<i>It's a local group
that believes</i>

22:15.827 --> 22:17.034
the police and
the government

22:17.034 --> 22:19.241
are plotting some
grand conspiracy.

22:19.241 --> 22:19.965
<i>You know what Jesse?</i>

22:19.965 --> 22:20.758
Bookmark that one.

22:20.758 --> 22:21.517
Okay.

22:21.517 --> 22:22.689
It may not be
Trevor's group.

22:22.689 --> 22:25.034
But it might be worth our
while to keep tabs on them.

22:28.724 --> 22:29.448
<i>Oh hold on.</i>

22:29.448 --> 22:30.724
I have a
comment here

22:30.724 --> 22:33.620
mentioning a Cataclysm Readiness
Society in St. John's.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.517
Okay I'll see
what I can dig up.

22:40.034 --> 22:41.862
So I don't have to go
back to the hospital?

22:43.482 --> 22:45.068
No, that's the deal.

22:45.068 --> 22:46.482
You had the doctor
look at your leg.

22:46.482 --> 22:47.827
She said you're
free to go.

22:50.310 --> 22:51.655
What is this place?

22:53.206 --> 22:54.620
Uh-

22:54.620 --> 22:56.172
You lived here

22:57.482 --> 22:58.241
fourteen years ago.

22:58.241 --> 22:59.379
Do you remember that?

23:01.586 --> 23:02.586
With my dad?

23:04.137 --> 23:05.000
No.

23:05.000 --> 23:05.862
Not with
your dad.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.551
But he did live
on this street.

23:09.137 --> 23:10.620
That doesn't make
any sense okay?

23:10.620 --> 23:12.931
Why wouldn't
we live together?

23:12.931 --> 23:15.310
You were abducted by the
man you know as your father.

23:17.965 --> 23:19.379
I know that's probably
difficult to believe.

23:19.379 --> 23:21.172
Is that a lie?

23:21.172 --> 23:22.517
My dad says
that police lie.

23:22.517 --> 23:24.620
I'm not lying
to you, Alison.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.000
That woman
in the house-

23:34.000 --> 23:35.517
She was at the
hospital earlier.

23:42.793 --> 23:44.827
She'd really
like to see you.

23:49.655 --> 23:51.586
I guess that
would be okay.

23:55.241 --> 23:56.172
Okay.

24:10.793 --> 24:11.620
<i>Victor Khan?</i>

24:11.620 --> 24:12.517
Thanks for meeting me.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.620
Ah ah.

24:14.620 --> 24:15.827
You got a
phone on you?

24:15.827 --> 24:16.482
Yeah.

24:16.482 --> 24:17.241
Do me a favour?

24:17.241 --> 24:18.172
Shut it off.

24:18.862 --> 24:19.724
Toss it in here.

24:20.034 --> 24:20.862
Okay.

24:23.689 --> 24:25.655
It's a Faraday
net bag.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.034
It scrambles the
signal, you know?

24:27.034 --> 24:27.931
I hope you
don't mind.

24:27.931 --> 24:28.620
Oh completely, completely-

24:28.620 --> 24:29.862
I just-

24:29.862 --> 24:31.275
I wanted to ask you about that
Cataclysm Readiness group

24:31.275 --> 24:32.137
you were posting
about online.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.379
Oh yeah yeah yeah.

24:33.379 --> 24:34.620
You're starting
to worry too eh?

24:34.620 --> 24:35.310
Well yeah.

24:35.310 --> 24:37.620
I mean, it's
hard not to.

24:37.620 --> 24:38.758
Environmental disasters.

24:38.758 --> 24:40.275
Diseases coming out
of the woodwork.

24:40.275 --> 24:41.137
Yeah man.

24:41.137 --> 24:42.655
The atomic clock
is closer to midnight

24:42.655 --> 24:44.068
than it's been
in decades, you know?

24:44.068 --> 24:45.344
We've got chemicals
in our food.

24:45.344 --> 24:46.758
<i>You've got the
temperature changing.</i>

24:46.758 --> 24:48.931
We've got microplastics
in the water.

24:48.931 --> 24:50.689
Every country
in the world

24:50.689 --> 24:53.206
rattling sabres
at each other!

24:53.206 --> 24:54.413
When you put it
that way, yeah.

24:54.413 --> 24:55.068
That sounds hopeless.

24:55.068 --> 24:56.068
Well you know-

24:56.068 --> 24:59.551
there are still ways to
live outside the noise.

24:59.551 --> 25:00.758
You know-

25:00.758 --> 25:01.551
cleanly.

25:01.551 --> 25:02.827
Unpolluted.

25:02.827 --> 25:04.275
Unmonitored.

25:05.724 --> 25:07.000
Where do
you learn how?

25:08.275 --> 25:09.724
Look, I just don't
know how I feel

25:09.724 --> 25:11.137
about searching this
stuff up on the internet-

25:11.137 --> 25:12.551
where anyone
can track me.

25:12.551 --> 25:13.620
Right?

25:15.137 --> 25:18.344
I'm part of a group who are
getting ready for the end days.

25:18.344 --> 25:20.034
We meet Wednesdays at
the First United Church.

25:20.034 --> 25:21.517
Who runs
this group?

25:22.413 --> 25:23.068
No one.

25:23.068 --> 25:24.517
We're self-governed-

25:25.241 --> 25:26.241
I mean unless
you count Dave.

25:26.241 --> 25:27.689
He rents the basement
from the church.

25:27.689 --> 25:28.344
So-

25:28.344 --> 25:29.206
Oh.

25:30.172 --> 25:31.172
Oh!

25:31.172 --> 25:32.206
Sorry, I forgot
I had this!

25:45.172 --> 25:46.965
I hope you don't mind
that we stopped by.

25:48.413 --> 25:51.448
I'm sorry I was rude
at the hospital.

25:52.448 --> 25:54.482
Can I take a
look around?

25:55.620 --> 25:56.275
Of course.

25:56.275 --> 25:57.000
Please come in.

26:00.793 --> 26:02.068
<i>Um-</i>

26:02.068 --> 26:04.241
can I talk
to her alone?

26:10.551 --> 26:12.172
Yeah okay okay.

26:12.172 --> 26:13.344
I'll wait outside.

26:22.931 --> 26:23.896
Jesse.

26:23.896 --> 26:25.448
Charlie, I found
the needle.

26:25.448 --> 26:26.965
<i>There's one underground
prepper group</i>

26:26.965 --> 26:28.000
in St. John's.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.310
They're meeting
for a seminar-

26:29.310 --> 26:30.655
<i>this afternoon.</i>

26:30.655 --> 26:31.827
Is Trevor involved?

26:31.827 --> 26:34.344
Well there was a post on a
forum from two months ago.

26:34.344 --> 26:36.034
Bob gave a presentation

26:36.034 --> 26:38.448
<i>on how to keep a well-
stocked disaster pantry.</i>

26:38.448 --> 26:39.862
<i>I just need to
locate the church</i>

26:39.862 --> 26:40.551
<i>where the group meets.</i>

26:41.241 --> 26:41.965
<i>Oh!</i>

26:47.310 --> 26:49.068
<i>The name my source
gave me was a dead end.</i>

26:50.793 --> 26:51.655
Hey, uh- thanks Jesse.

26:51.655 --> 26:52.724
I've got to
call you back.

26:54.965 --> 26:55.758
Fiona?

26:58.655 --> 26:59.448
Fiona?

27:01.206 --> 27:02.379
Damn it!

27:02.724 --> 27:04.000
Stand back pal.

27:06.137 --> 27:07.172
That's a better idea.

27:16.275 --> 27:17.413
What happened?

27:17.413 --> 27:18.586
Uh, she ran.

27:18.586 --> 27:19.379
She's gone.

27:20.965 --> 27:21.586
You okay?

27:21.586 --> 27:25.689
Yeah go!

27:45.103 --> 27:45.896
<i>This will help.</i>

27:45.896 --> 27:46.965
<i>Okay yeah.</i>

27:46.965 --> 27:48.275
Thank you.

27:51.827 --> 27:53.482
I turned my head.

27:53.482 --> 27:54.620
She hit me
from behind.

27:54.620 --> 27:55.620
She was out
the back door

27:55.620 --> 27:56.482
<i>before I
had a chance.</i>

27:56.482 --> 27:57.827
It's not your fault.

27:57.827 --> 27:59.482
Sure it is.

28:01.758 --> 28:03.448
I was so young
when I had her.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.517
<i>Her dad took off</i>

28:05.517 --> 28:06.724
on the first
boat out of here.

28:06.724 --> 28:08.068
Left me alone.

28:09.137 --> 28:10.793
<i>You did the best
that you could.</i>

28:10.793 --> 28:12.482
Yeah, I tried.

28:14.206 --> 28:15.724
<i>I worked two jobs.</i>

28:15.724 --> 28:17.689
<i>I barely slept.</i>

28:17.689 --> 28:22.344
The day she went missing
I'd just pulled a triple.

28:22.344 --> 28:25.000
I could hardly
keep my eyes open.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.413
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

28:29.172 --> 28:31.206
She played outside
on her own before.

28:31.206 --> 28:32.655
<i>You know?</i>

28:32.655 --> 28:34.344
<i>It was supposed
to be a</i>

28:34.344 --> 28:36.034
safe neighbourhood.

28:36.034 --> 28:36.689
<i>Fiona.</i>

28:36.689 --> 28:38.827
I'm going
to find her.

28:40.034 --> 28:41.034
Oh yeah?

28:42.034 --> 28:43.689
Who is <i>her</i> now?

28:44.689 --> 28:46.344
She doesn't
even know me.

28:48.275 --> 28:49.689
You know, last
time I saw you-

28:49.689 --> 28:50.862
you said you
were off this stuff.

28:50.862 --> 28:52.068
<i>Mmm.</i>
Hmm?

28:52.172 --> 28:55.896
Yeah, well last
time I saw you-

28:55.896 --> 28:57.793
I was still holding
on to hope.

28:57.793 --> 28:59.862
Hey hey.

28:59.862 --> 29:01.413
Look at me.

29:03.724 --> 29:05.965
It's not time
to lose hope.

29:06.793 --> 29:07.655
Come on.

29:13.655 --> 29:15.862
<i>Charlie I cleaned
myself up for the day</i>

29:15.862 --> 29:17.551
when I would meet
my daughter again.

29:18.827 --> 29:20.896
I never thought that
when that day came-

29:20.896 --> 29:22.413
she wouldn't
want to see me.

29:29.275 --> 29:32.758
She said <i>I have
nothing against you.</i>

29:32.758 --> 29:34.758
<i>But you're
not my mother!</i>

29:37.103 --> 29:39.862
Do you have any
idea how that feels?

29:43.310 --> 29:44.241
Come on.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.413
You're coming down
to the station with me.

29:45.413 --> 29:47.172
Are you arresting me?

29:48.000 --> 29:48.620
No.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.620
Come on.

29:57.275 --> 29:58.655
Charlie what were
you thinking?

29:58.655 --> 29:59.862
I made a mistake.

29:59.862 --> 30:01.379
I thought that she was going
to recognize her old life.

30:01.379 --> 30:03.000
Yeah well you should
have taken it slower.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.551
I should have brought
her home 14 years ago.

30:04.551 --> 30:06.103
Where's Fiona now?

30:06.103 --> 30:07.482
She's with a
couple of officers.

30:07.482 --> 30:10.241
I got her to agree
to talk to Dalton.

30:10.241 --> 30:11.379
Dalton?

30:11.379 --> 30:12.344
Why?

30:12.344 --> 30:13.724
Well because she's
started drinking again.

30:13.724 --> 30:14.896
<i>I thought maybe
he could help her</i>

30:14.896 --> 30:16.344
<i>before she
gets too deep.</i>

30:16.448 --> 30:17.034
Hey.

30:17.034 --> 30:18.241
I got something.

30:19.275 --> 30:20.586
Go ahead.

30:21.689 --> 30:22.724
Can you handle
the meeting-

30:22.724 --> 30:23.517
with Fiona and Dalton?

30:23.517 --> 30:24.586
Yeah of course.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.413
Thanks.

30:26.413 --> 30:27.206
<i>Trevor's group</i>

30:27.206 --> 30:28.724

30:32.931 --> 30:33.896
<i>I appreciate
your interest.</i>

30:34.551 --> 30:35.724
<i>But unfortunately-</i>

30:35.724 --> 30:38.379

only seminar, Mr. -

30:38.379 --> 30:40.103
Uh- Detective.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.034
Charlie Hudson.

30:42.482 --> 30:43.931
That goes double
then, Detective.

30:43.931 --> 30:45.344
Ah.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.206
<i>Politely-</i>

30:46.206 --> 30:47.793
I'd like to ask
you to leave.

30:47.793 --> 30:49.620
I'm just here to ask
a few questions.

30:49.620 --> 30:51.862
It always starts
with the questions.

30:51.862 --> 30:53.551
Mm-hmm.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.413
Well it's a nice garden
you've got here.

30:55.413 --> 30:57.379
<i>When society collapses-</i>

30:57.379 --> 30:59.586
<i>we've got to know how
to provide for ourselves.</i>

30:59.586 --> 31:01.275
Even if we're forced underground.

31:02.586 --> 31:05.517
Well I was just at the home of
one of your group's members.

31:05.517 --> 31:06.551
Bob Lowther.

31:06.551 --> 31:08.137
<i>He could use
this seminar.</i>

31:08.137 --> 31:09.137
<i>His gardens are-</i>

31:09.137 --> 31:10.896
um- above ground now.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.482
Bob's a good guy.

31:14.482 --> 31:17.000
<i>I'm not going to help you
pester him or his family-</i>

31:17.000 --> 31:19.000
<i>if that's what
you're after.</i>

31:19.000 --> 31:21.000
Do you know his
daughter, Allie?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.241
Yeah she's a nice kid.

31:23.241 --> 31:25.689
I watched her grow up into
an upstanding young woman.

31:25.689 --> 31:26.586
Mm-hmm.

31:26.586 --> 31:27.931
Well I'm glad you
had the privilege.

31:27.931 --> 31:29.344
Because her mother didn't-

31:29.344 --> 31:32.103
because her daughter was
abducted by that good guy.

31:33.655 --> 31:34.689
Look Dave.

31:34.689 --> 31:35.793
I don't have anything
against you.

31:35.793 --> 31:37.551
<i>I've got nothing
against your group.</i>

31:37.551 --> 31:39.310
But the man you know
as Bob Lowther-

31:39.310 --> 31:40.862
is actually Trevor Miles.

31:40.862 --> 31:43.137
And he abducted the
girl that you know as Allie.

31:43.137 --> 31:45.103
<i>He may have also killed a
man named Bertrand Boyle.</i>

31:45.103 --> 31:46.517
<i>Do you know him?</i>

31:47.551 --> 31:49.586
No.

31:51.482 --> 31:52.655
<i>I swear.</i>

31:52.655 --> 31:54.172
<i>I had no idea.</i>

31:54.172 --> 31:55.344
Bob, Allie-

31:55.344 --> 31:56.827
<i>and Dolly-</i>

31:56.827 --> 31:58.586
were such a
sweet family.

31:59.655 --> 32:03.034
They always seemed so happy
together until Dolly passed.

32:03.034 --> 32:04.275
<i>After he lost her-</i>

32:04.275 --> 32:06.379
<i>Bob became
totally paranoid.</i>

32:06.379 --> 32:07.689
How do you mean?

32:07.689 --> 32:11.137
If anyone who lived as clean
as Dolly could get cancer-

32:11.137 --> 32:14.379
that confirmed to Bob that the
end-days were already here.

32:15.103 --> 32:16.310
When's the last time
you saw them?

32:17.344 --> 32:18.931
Not for a while.

32:18.931 --> 32:22.379
He kept talking
about building a place-

32:22.379 --> 32:23.965
where he can
finally feel safe.

32:23.965 --> 32:26.517
<i>I imagine that's where
he spends most of his time.</i>

32:28.206 --> 32:29.965
<i>Did you find Allie?</i>

32:31.896 --> 32:33.034
Yeah.

32:33.034 --> 32:33.931
Yeah we did.

32:35.241 --> 32:37.413
But we lost her.

32:38.965 --> 32:40.758
Allie is Bob's
whole world.

32:42.206 --> 32:44.758
If you're trying to
tear them apart-

32:44.758 --> 32:46.379
he won't let
that happen.

32:48.448 --> 32:49.896
Well he won't
make that decision.

33:04.137 --> 33:04.931
That's her?

33:04.931 --> 33:05.586
Yeah.

33:05.586 --> 33:06.758
She wants this?

33:06.758 --> 33:08.655
She started drinking when
her daughter went missing.

33:08.655 --> 33:10.586
But Charlie says she's
been sober ten years now.

33:10.586 --> 33:11.689
And she's drinking again?

33:11.689 --> 33:14.172
She's going through
a rough time.

33:17.241 --> 33:18.310
Flirting, I suppose.

33:19.551 --> 33:20.862
Addicts don't flirt.

33:20.862 --> 33:22.586
They use or
they don't.

33:22.586 --> 33:24.482
<i>The services a
Dollar A Day supports</i>

33:24.482 --> 33:26.413
can only help a
person who wants it.

33:26.413 --> 33:28.379
She agreed
to talk to you.

33:28.379 --> 33:29.931
I think that's a
good sign, right?

33:30.758 --> 33:31.793
Yeah.

33:36.620 --> 33:39.689
Joe, I'm just at
Trevor's cabin.

33:39.689 --> 33:41.172
Uniforms have
already done a sweep.

33:41.172 --> 33:42.862
But I don't know.

33:42.862 --> 33:45.758
I just want to see if
Rex can find anything.

33:49.758 --> 33:50.689
Come on.

34:23.724 --> 34:24.965
What is it?

34:38.586 --> 34:39.862
Well-

34:39.862 --> 34:43.068
it looks like Trevor built that
safe place for Alison after all.

34:43.068 --> 34:44.379
Huh?

34:44.586 --> 34:45.413
Come on.

35:21.931 --> 35:22.586
Alison.

35:25.758 --> 35:26.413
Alison!

35:26.517 --> 35:27.206
Alison!

35:38.965 --> 35:39.896
<i>Hey Trevor.</i>

35:44.655 --> 35:46.172
What did you
do to the kid?

35:46.172 --> 35:47.793
That's on you-

35:48.896 --> 35:50.241
interfering.

35:52.241 --> 35:53.413
She was upset.

35:54.931 --> 35:56.413
She needed something
to help her sleep.

35:57.551 --> 35:58.275
So you drugged her?

35:58.275 --> 36:00.275
Just to calm
her down.

36:01.241 --> 36:02.655
You should have
left us alone!

36:02.655 --> 36:04.344
You know I
wouldn't do that.

36:05.551 --> 36:07.310
Okay, so
here we are.

36:08.586 --> 36:10.310
How do we all get out
of this room safely?

36:11.862 --> 36:13.655
Your safety-

36:13.655 --> 36:15.310
means nothing to me.

36:17.172 --> 36:17.896
Easy pal.

36:17.896 --> 36:19.034
Easy.

36:19.034 --> 36:21.482
I do what it takes
to protect Alison.

36:21.482 --> 36:22.827
I do what's right.

36:22.827 --> 36:24.724
That why you killed
Bertrand Boyle?

36:27.482 --> 36:28.862
I could tell that
little weasel-face

36:28.862 --> 36:30.931
was going to
turn me in.

36:30.931 --> 36:32.551
Bertrand was on
his way out anyway.

36:32.551 --> 36:33.827
We're all on
our way out!

36:36.931 --> 36:38.896
Alison's life is
just getting started.

36:41.413 --> 36:43.517
<i>No you don't
come here-</i>

36:43.517 --> 36:46.310
and pretend like you're
going to help her.

36:46.310 --> 36:47.379
I keep her safe.

36:47.379 --> 36:48.137
Me!

36:48.896 --> 36:50.793
<i>You have
her drugged</i>

36:50.793 --> 36:52.689
in a bunker!

36:52.689 --> 36:54.931
You stole her
from her mother!

36:54.931 --> 36:56.862
That woman couldn't provide
a good home for her!

36:58.827 --> 37:00.482
<i>Alison was playing
by the street.</i>

37:00.482 --> 37:01.931
She could have
got hit by a car!

37:01.931 --> 37:03.793
<i>Then why didn't
you call the cops?</i>

37:03.793 --> 37:05.482
You didn't kidnap her

37:05.482 --> 37:06.793
because you
wanted to protect her.

37:06.793 --> 37:09.344
<i>You kidnapped her because you
wanted a child of your own.</i>

37:11.586 --> 37:12.724
Dad?

37:13.724 --> 37:15.620
Is that true?

37:20.206 --> 37:21.896
Okay okay okay.

37:23.827 --> 37:26.482
You got to raise
her as a father.

37:26.482 --> 37:28.482
<i>She's a great kid.</i>

37:28.482 --> 37:29.793
<i>The way this ends-</i>

37:29.793 --> 37:31.931
is you put
the gun down.

37:31.931 --> 37:32.758
And we leave peacefully.

37:32.758 --> 37:33.448
No!

37:36.827 --> 37:37.724
No.

37:39.206 --> 37:42.931
Me and Alison are going
to leave this place.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.413
I'm not going to
let you do that.

37:51.172 --> 37:52.758
Alison.

37:52.758 --> 37:54.034
Go upstairs.

37:56.206 --> 37:57.310
No.

37:58.620 --> 37:59.517
Go.

38:00.448 --> 38:01.448
No!

38:02.275 --> 38:03.206
Alison.

38:05.517 --> 38:06.344
Alison!

38:11.620 --> 38:12.724
You did this!

38:12.724 --> 38:13.827
You poisoned her mind!

38:14.655 --> 38:15.310
<i>Stop it!</i>

38:15.310 --> 38:16.000
Stop it!

38:16.000 --> 38:16.862
Stop it,
both of you!

38:18.482 --> 38:19.241
Dad! Dad!

38:20.586 --> 38:21.379
<i>Give it to me.</i>

38:21.482 --> 38:22.137
<i>Give it to me.</i>

38:22.137 --> 38:22.827
Let go.

38:24.000 --> 38:24.793
Let it go.

38:25.517 --> 38:27.275
<i>Let it go.</i>

38:33.137 --> 38:35.241
I just wanted to
protect you Allie.

38:37.241 --> 38:38.586
I know.

38:39.793 --> 38:40.793
<i>Go on.</i>

38:40.793 --> 38:41.827
<i>Turn around.</i>

38:41.827 --> 38:43.482
<i>Hands on your head.</i>

38:43.482 --> 38:44.758
<i>Trevor Miles.</i>

38:44.758 --> 38:45.793
You're under arrest-

38:45.793 --> 38:47.379
for the murder
of Bertrand Boyle-

38:47.379 --> 38:49.000
<i>and for the abduction-</i>

38:49.000 --> 38:51.034
of Alison Anders.

39:02.068 --> 39:03.137
It's okay.

39:08.620 --> 39:10.000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

39:14.413 --> 39:15.827
Fiona has agreed
to see a counselor.

39:15.827 --> 39:18.068
Dollar A Day helps to
fund an organization

39:18.068 --> 39:20.103
that will provide
good help for her.

39:20.103 --> 39:21.448
Is she going
to be okay?

39:21.448 --> 39:24.482
Knowing her daughter
is alive is something.

39:24.482 --> 39:26.758
But if she wants
to stay sober

39:26.758 --> 39:28.034
she'll get the
help she needs.

39:28.896 --> 39:29.517
That's great.

39:29.517 --> 39:31.172
Thanks Dalton.

39:31.275 --> 39:33.137
Yeah, appreciate everything
Dollar A Day does, man.

39:34.344 --> 39:35.620
Thanks.

39:37.413 --> 39:38.827
Alison's ready.

39:39.655 --> 39:40.827
You want me
to come with-?

39:41.827 --> 39:42.689
Uh-

39:43.758 --> 39:44.413
No.

39:46.275 --> 39:47.275
I got it
this time.

39:48.931 --> 39:49.689
Come on pal.

39:54.620 --> 39:57.137
What's going to
happen to my dad?

39:57.137 --> 39:58.517
That's going to be
up to the courts.

39:58.517 --> 40:00.241
<i>He really did-</i>

40:00.241 --> 40:01.793
kidnap me?

40:02.413 --> 40:03.724
Yeah.

40:03.724 --> 40:05.724
And my mom really
was a good mom?

40:07.724 --> 40:09.482
Yeah she was.

40:11.172 --> 40:12.655
It's my choice, right?

40:13.241 --> 40:14.931
It's your choice.

40:23.724 --> 40:25.827
You're not coming
in with me?

40:28.586 --> 40:30.241
I think you're ready.

40:30.241 --> 40:31.310
Don't you?

40:34.103 --> 40:35.379
Will you come
in anyways?

40:37.551 --> 40:38.241
Yeah!

40:51.068 --> 40:52.275
<i>Hi.</i>

40:52.275 --> 40:53.758
Hi!

40:53.758 --> 40:55.000
Can we come in?

40:57.068 --> 40:58.448
Yeah of course!

41:10.172 --> 41:11.689
I'll find a place.

41:13.344 --> 41:15.482
You're welcome
to stay here.

41:16.379 --> 41:17.793
I know.

41:17.793 --> 41:21.103
But I don't feel
like I belong here.

41:22.275 --> 41:26.241
I'm not the person that you've
been waiting for all this time.

41:27.413 --> 41:28.620
What are you
going to do?

41:29.344 --> 41:30.655
Uhh-

41:30.655 --> 41:32.137
Figure out my life.

41:32.931 --> 41:34.758
You can stay here.

41:34.758 --> 41:35.551
Honest.

41:35.551 --> 41:36.793
I'll give you
all the space-

41:36.793 --> 41:37.482
I can't-

41:37.931 --> 41:39.034
I can't.

41:59.206 --> 42:00.103
Um-

42:00.103 --> 42:02.517
before you go-

42:04.000 --> 42:06.379
<i>I cleaned up
Chloe for you.</i>

42:08.068 --> 42:08.689
Chloe?

42:08.689 --> 42:10.655
You know her name?

42:10.655 --> 42:12.137
Yeah!

42:12.137 --> 42:13.517
I got her
for you!

42:15.517 --> 42:16.896
I got you something.

42:18.896 --> 42:19.551
Here.

42:20.896 --> 42:22.689
I love her!

42:22.689 --> 42:24.551
Thank you!

42:26.827 --> 42:28.241
<i>Here.</i>

42:44.896 --> 42:45.896
Mom!

42:47.241 --> 42:48.896
Yeah!

43:00.758 --> 43:02.758
I'm your mother-

43:02.758 --> 43:04.206
<i>no matter what.</i>

43:04.206 --> 43:05.379
Mom!
